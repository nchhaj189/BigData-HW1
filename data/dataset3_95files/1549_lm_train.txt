IF YOU ABSTAIN YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS"--THIS IS WRONG
BE STEADFAST NOT CARELESS
THE RESULT IS INEVITABLE
THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD IN CHRIST ARRIVE AT THIS ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION
FOR EXAMPLE CHRIST BY HIS RESURRECTION BECAME FREE FROM THE GRAVE AND YET THE GRAVE REMAINS
MY DOCTRINE MUST BE RIGHT
IT PREVENTS US FROM BEING VAIN AND FROM BEING PUFFED UP WITH THE WICKED OPINION OF OUR OWN WORK-RIGHTEOUSNESS
THIS WEIRD CONCEPTION OF THOSE AWESOME SAINTS I HAD GAINED OUT OF THE BOOKS OF THE SCHOLASTICS AND CHURCH FATHERS
BECAUSE REASON PREFERS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH PAUL CALLS THE LAW A YOKE A YOKE OF BONDAGE
CHRIST'S MERCY WOULD BE OF NO USE TO ME
SO VIVIDLY HAD HE DESCRIBED CHRIST TO THEM THAT THEY COULD ALMOST SEE AND HANDLE HIM
ALL THE BEST LAWS CEREMONIES RELIGIONS AND DEEDS OF THE WORLD CANNOT TAKE AWAY SIN GUILT CANNOT DISPATCH DEATH CANNOT PURCHASE LIFE
BUT THE LAW IS ALSO A SPIRITUAL PRISON A VERITABLE HELL
A TRUE CHRISTIAN CONDUCTS HIMSELF IN SUCH A WAY THAT HE DOES NOT NEED ANY LAW TO WARN OR TO RESTRAIN HIM
FAITH IN CHRIST REGENERATES US INTO THE CHILDREN OF GOD
WE MUST FIND AND DEFINE THE PROPER PURPOSE OF THE LAW
THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
IF IT IS A QUESTION OF FAITH OR CONSCIENCE IGNORE THE LAW ENTIRELY
THESE MANY TYRANTS AND ENEMIES OF OURS MAY ACCUSE AND FRIGHTEN US BUT THEY DARE NOT CONDEMN US FOR CHRIST WHOM GOD THE FATHER HAS RAISED FROM THE DEAD IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OUR VICTORY
IF WE BEAR IN MIND THIS DISTINCTION NEITHER GOSPEL NOR LAW SHALL TRESPASS UPON EACH OTHER
YOU HAVE INJURED YOURSELVES
EVEN THE ELEMENT OF TIME SERVES TO BUILD HIS CASE AGAINST THE FALSE APOSTLES
LET THE SUN SHINE BY DAY THE MOON AND THE STARS BY NIGHT
GOD ALONE CAN CREATE AND PRESERVE FAITH IN US
DOES NOT THE LAW SAY SO I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW HOW SO I HAVE ANOTHER LAW THE LAW OF LIBERTY WHAT DO YOU MEAN--'LIBERTY THE LIBERTY OF CHRIST FOR CHRIST HAS MADE ME FREE FROM THE LAW THAT HELD ME DOWN
OUR FIRST CONSIDERATION MUST BE THE COMFORT OF TROUBLED CONSCIENCES THAT THEY MAY NOT PERISH WITH THE MULTITUDES
GOD WINKS AT MY SINS AND COVERS THEM UP
HE WAS MADE UNDER THE LAW WHEN CHRIST CAME HE FOUND US ALL IN PRISON
IT HARDLY SEEMS BEFITTING AN APOSTLE NOT ONLY TO DENOUNCE THE FALSE APOSTLES AS TROUBLERS OF THE CHURCH AND TO CONSIGN THEM TO THE DEVIL BUT ALSO TO WISH THAT THEY WERE UTTERLY CUT OFF--WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU CALL IT BUT PLAIN CURSING
THE APOSTLE INTENDS SOON TO CLOSE HIS EPISTLE AND THEREFORE REPEATS ONCE MORE THE GENERAL EXHORTATION UNTO GOOD DEEDS
THE FIRST PASSAGE IS TAKEN FROM GENESIS 16:6
IT GOES TO SHOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN JUSTIFIED BY FAITH TO FULFILL THE LAW
WHAT A RELIEF FOR A CHRISTIAN TO KNOW THAT CHRIST IS COVERED ALL OVER WITH MY SINS YOUR SINS AND THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD
BY FAITH SAYS HE WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF GOD
THIS IS AIMED ESPECIALLY AT THE JEWS WHO THINK THAT THE PROMISES OF GOD ARE IMPEDED BY THEIR SINS
THE DEVIL SENT THE FALSE APOSTLES TO YOU AND THEY TALLIED YOU INTO BELIEVING THAT YOU ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
PAUL DESIRES THAT CHRISTIANS AVOID DRUNKENNESS AND GLUTTONY THAT THEY LIVE TEMPERATE AND SOBER LIVES IN ORDER THAT THE BODY MAY NOT GROW SOFT AND SENSUAL
I MARVEL
BUT LET EVERY MAN PROVE HIS OWN WORK AND THEN SHALL HE HAVE REJOICING IN HIMSELF ALONE AND NOT IN ANOTHER
THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW WHICH PAUL ALSO TERMS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE FLESH IS SO FAR FROM JUSTIFYING A PERSON THAT THOSE WHO ONCE HAD THE HOLY SPIRIT AND LOST HIM END UP IN THE LAW TO THEIR COMPLETE DESTRUCTION
THE FACT IS WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST
TALK AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE I AM DEAD TO YOU
I SEE ANOTHER LAW IN MY MEMBERS WARRING AGAINST THE LAW OF MY MIND AND BRINGING ME INTO THE CAPTIVITY TO THE LAW OF SIN WHICH IS IN MY MEMBERS
BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOUR WAY
BUT PRIVATELY TO THEM WHICH WERE OF REPUTATION
THE JEW IMAGINES HE IS DOING THE WILL OF GOD IF HE CONCENTRATES ON THE LAW OF MOSES
AGAIN MOSES COULD NOT BE A MEDIATOR OF THE PEOPLE ONLY
AM I THEREFORE BECOME YOUR ENEMY BECAUSE I TELL YOU THE TRUTH
ELIJAH AND JONAH BECAME WEARY OF LIFE AND PRAYED FOR DEATH
THE MONKS WERE SO INFLATED WITH THE OPINION OF THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD SO MUCH HOLINESS THAT THEY COULD AFFORD TO SELL SOME OF IT TO OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEIR OWN HEARTS CONVINCED THEM OF UNHOLINESS
IF THEY HAVE PERSECUTED ME THEY WILL ALSO PERSECUTE YOU CHRIST TAKES ALL THE BLAME
TRUE CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST WHO LIVES IN US
WHO CAN ADEQUATELY EXPRESS THE BOON THAT COMES TO A PERSON WHEN HE HAS THE HEART-ASSURANCE THAT GOD WILL NEVERMORE BE ANGRY WITH HIM BUT WILL FOREVER BE MERCIFUL TO HIM FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
THEY MAY BE GOOD PREACHERS BUT THEY DO NOT EDIFY
THE GOVERNOR THE MAYOR THE PREACHER THE TEACHER THE SCHOLAR FATHER MOTHER ARE PERSONS WHOM WE ARE TO LOVE AND REVERE BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FORGET GOD
LEARN TO BELIEVE THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN NOT FOR PICAYUNE AND IMAGINARY TRANSGRESSIONS BUT FOR MOUNTAINOUS SINS
INDEED CHRIST IS MEEK GENTLE AND MERCIFUL BUT ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS
GOD HANDS OUT HIS GIFTS FREELY UNTO ALL MEN
BUT THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES AND BECOME VAIN IN THEIR IMAGINATIONS AS PAUL SAYS ROMANS 1:21
YOU NO LONGER TEACH TRULY
WE ROUTED THEM BY THE JUDGMENT OF THE APOSTLES AND WE WOULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM NO NOT AN INCH WE TOO WERE WILLING TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF CONCESSIONS TO THE PAPISTS
THEY DID NOT WANT TO REST CIRCUMCISION AND THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW IN CHRISTIAN LIBERTY
BURDENED WITH THE SINS OF A DAVID WHO COMMITTED ADULTERY AND MURDER AND GAVE THE HEATHEN OCCASION TO LAUGH AT THE LORD
BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN MY SON I WILL FORGIVE YOUR SINS UNTIL DEATH SHALL DELIVER YOU FROM THE BODY OF SIN LEARN TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTION OF YOUR CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS
THEY INSIST THAT THE SINGULAR SEED IS PUT FOR THE PLURAL SEEDS WE PREFER THE INTERPRETATION OF PAUL WHO MAKES A FINE CASE FOR CHRIST AND FOR US OUT OF THE SINGULAR SEED AND IS AFTER ALL INSPIRED TO DO SO BY THE HOLY GHOST
THE GOSPEL COMMANDS US TO LOOK AWAY FROM OUR OWN GOOD WORKS TO THE PROMISES OF GOD IN CHRIST THE MEDIATOR
IT HINDERS RIGHTEOUSNESS
HOELTER COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS 1535 BY MARTIN LUTHER TRANSLATED BY THEODORE GRAEBNER PREFACE THE PREPARATION OF THIS EDITION OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS WAS FIRST SUGGESTED TO ME BY MR P
SECONDLY MEATS MAY BE REFUSED IN THE MISTAKEN HOPE OF THEREBY OBTAINING RIGHTEOUSNESS
PEOPLE BEGIN TO HATE AND SHUN THEM AND REFUSE TO ACCEPT COUNSEL OR COMFORT FROM THEM
WE CAN HEAR HIM SAY TO THE GALATIANS
EVEN AS ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS ACCOUNTED TO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
I AM SURE I AM ONE OF CHRIST'S TRUE SAINTS
ACCURSED BE THAT DOCTRINE LIFE AND RELIGION WHICH ENDEAVORS TO OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BEFORE GOD BY THE LAW AND ITS CREEDS
NOWADAYS THE NAME OF LUTHER CARRIES THE SAME STIGMA
ABRAHAM HAD NOTHING ELSE TO GO BY BUT THE PROMISE
THE POPE'S SYNAGOGUE TEACHES THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE APOSTLE COMMANDS
BEWARE OF FALSE PROPHETS WHICH COME TO YOU IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING MATT
YET PAUL CALLS IT SIMPLY IDOLATRY
THE MERIT THAT WE PLEAD AND THE WORK THAT WE PROFFER IS CHRIST WHO WAS MADE A CURSE FOR US
THE SCRIPTURES PRESENT CHRIST IN A TWOFOLD ASPECT
HENCE EVERY HOLY MORAL LAW-WORKER IS ACCURSED
HE DID NOT SEND HIS SON TO FILL US WITH SADNESS BUT TO GLADDEN OUR HEARTS
SO REASON OUR OPPONENTS
THE REFORMER HAD LECTURED ON THIS EPISTLE OF ST PAUL'S IN 1519 AND AGAIN IN 1523
UNDER THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD
THEY GO AS FAR TO ENFORCE THEM WITH THE SWORD
EVEN SO HATH THE LORD ORDAINED THAT THEY WHICH PREACH THE GOSPEL SHOULD LIVE OF THE GOSPEL I COR
WHAT MAY SEEM TO US A LIFE SLOW IN CHRISTIAN DEVELOPMENT MAY SEEM TO GOD A LIFE OF RAPID PROGRESSION IN GRACE
ARE NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE TO GIVE ALL THEY HAVE TO THEIR MINISTERS BUT THAT THEY SHOULD SUPPORT THEM LIBERALLY AND GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO LIVE WELL
AS CONCERNING THIS SECT WE KNOW THAT EVERYWHERE IT IS SPOKEN AGAINST ACTS 28:22 NO MATTER HOW BARREN AND FORSAKEN HOW WEAK AND DESOLATE THE CHURCH MAY SEEM SHE ALONE IS REALLY FRUITFUL BEFORE GOD
IN HIS GREAT DESIRE TO RECALL THE GALATIANS PAUL DRAWS HIMSELF INTO THE ARGUMENT
THAT YOU ARE NOT NOW READY TO PLUCK OUT YOUR EYES FOR ME
THE ANGELS CANNOT
THAT SOMEBODY IS THE SON OF GOD TO WHOM BE PRAISE AND GLORY FOREVER
THEY ARE THAT WAY BECAUSE AS ST PAUL SAYS THEY THINK THEMSELVES TO BE SOMETHING THEY THINK THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SCRIPTURES
THEREFORE SIN CANNOT GET US TO DOUBT THE GRACE OF GOD
THEY COMBED PAUL'S WRITINGS FOR CONTRADICTIONS OUR OPPONENTS DO THE SAME TO ACCUSE HIM OF TEACHING CONTRADICTORY THINGS
THAT BAPTISM SHOULD BE THE WASHING OF REGENERATION
CHRIST IS THE DEATH OF DEATH
WE POSSESS CHRIST BY FAITH AND IN THE MIDST OF OUR AFFLICTIONS WE HOPEFULLY WAIT FOR THE CONSUMMATION OF OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS YOU MAY SAY THE TROUBLE IS I DON'T FEEL AS IF I AM RIGHTEOUS YOU MUST NOT FEEL BUT BELIEVE
TO GIVE A SHORT DEFINITION OF A CHRISTIAN
THE LAW SCOLDS US SIN SCREAMS AT US DEATH THUNDERS AT US THE DEVIL ROARS AT US
THE APOSTLES HAD THE SAME CHARGE THE IDENTICAL GOSPEL
RATHER URGE THE PEOPLE TO EXERT AND TO EXERCISE THEMSELVES IN GOOD WORKS SO THAT THE HOLY GHOST WILL FEEL LIKE COMING TO THEM WHAT DID JESUS SAY TO MARTHA WHEN SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS AND COULD HARDLY STAND TO SEE HER SISTER MARY SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS JUST LISTENING
ALL THE SAME THE LAW ACCOMPLISHES THIS MUCH THAT IT WILL OUTWARDLY AT LEAST AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REPRESS VICE AND CRIME
ONLY USE NOT LIBERTY FOR AN OCCASION TO THE FLESH BUT BY LOVE SERVE ONE ANOTHER
WE ARE NOT NOW SPEAKING OF THIS LIBERTY
THEY POUNCE ON THIS ONE SENTENCE WHICH GAVE MUCH ALMS TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE IT SERVES THEIR ASSERTION THAT MERIT PRECEDES GRACE
THOSE WHO INTEND TO OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY THEIR OWN EFFORTS DO NOT SAY IN SO MANY WORDS
THE APOSTLE ADDS THE AFTERTHOUGHT
I AM GOING TO JUSTIFY YOU PEOPLE
BUT PAUL SAW THAT PETER'S ERROR WOULD LEAD TO THE DAMAGE OF THE WHOLE CHURCH UNLESS IT WERE CORRECTED
ONLY THE HOLY SPIRIT CAN PRESERVE US FROM THE MISFORTUNE OF PRIDE
THE LAW HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ME THAT I SHOULD LOVE GOD AND MY NEIGHBOR THAT I SHOULD LIVE IN CHASTITY TEMPERANCE PATIENCE ETC
WHY DID GOD GIVE THE LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE IF IT CANNOT JUSTIFY A PERSON
WE OUGHT TO PROVE EARTHLY THINGS BY HEAVENLY THINGS AND NOT HEAVENLY THINGS BY EARTHLY THINGS
HE SAW THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WEDGED BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE APPROACHING ARMIES OF PHARAOH
WE CONCLUDE WITH PAUL THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN CHRIST WITHOUT THE LAW
NONE OF US HEED OR URGE OR PRACTICE THIS COMMANDMENT PROPERLY
THIS ARGUMENT BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE GALATIANS PLEASED THE APOSTLE SO WELL THAT HE RETURNS TO IT AFTER HE HAD WARNED THEM AGAINST THEIR TWOFOLD DANGER
ALL THEY CAN DO IS TO BELLOW THAT GOOD WORKS OUGHT TO BE DONE
ONLY PAUL AMONG THE APOSTLES CALLS THE LAW THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS THE STRENGTH OF SIN THE LETTER THAT KILLETH ETC
HE WAS NUMBERED WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS
THESE PREVENT MEN FROM ACCEPTING THE GOSPEL OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO DYING HE DID NOT TRUST IN HIS CHASTE LIFE FOR SALVATION
WE ANSWER WITH PAUL
IN THIS ALLEGORY ABRAHAM REPRESENTS GOD
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED THROUGH FAITH WE BELONG TO CHRIST AND CHRIST TO US
THE CURSE OF GOD WAGED A SIMILAR BATTLE WITH THE ETERNAL MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST
IF WE OBSERVE THE LAW IN ORDER TO BE JUSTIFIED OR AFTER HAVING BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST WE THINK WE MUST FURTHER BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW WE CONVERT CHRIST INTO A LEGISLATOR AND A MINISTER OF SIN
AS HE STATED BEFORE PAUL HAD NO SMALL MATTER IN HAND BUT THE CHIEF ARTICLE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
AND WHAT BOOK WOULD BE YOUR CHOICE THERE IS ONE BOOK THAT LUTHER HIMSELF LIKES BETTER THAN ANY OTHER
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN GRACE WANDERS UNTO THE EARTH I.E INTO THE BODY TELL GRACE
21:11 BUT GOD APPROVED SARAH'S ACTION AND SAID TO ABRAHAM
LET US DO EVERYTHING TO ADVANCE THE GLORY AND AUTHORITY OF GOD'S WORD
3:9 VERSE 31
AND IF YE BE CHRIST'S THEN ARE YE ABRAHAM'S SEED AND HEIRS ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE
IT IS AN INSULT TO SAY THAT ANY MAN DIED IN VAIN
THE LAW THEY SAY CANCELED THE PROMISES PAUL ANSWERS
WHY DO YOU GIVE THESE PESTILENT FELLOWS A HEARING IN THE FIRST PLACE
THIS SENTENCE AFFECTS NOT ONLY THOSE POPES CARDINALS BISHOPS AND MONKS WHO WERE NOTORIOUSLY WICKED AND MADE THEIR BELLIES THEIR GODS
THIS IS OUR COMFORT IN THE MINISTRY THAT OURS IS A DIVINE OFFICE TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DIVINELY CALLED
FROM THESE EXTORTIONS OUR COUNTRYMEN ARE NOW DELIVERED BY THE GOSPEL
I ONLY STATED WHAT I HAD DONE THAT I HAD PREACHED TO THE GENTILES FAITH IN CHRIST WITHOUT THE LAW AND THAT IN RESPONSE TO MY PREACHING THE HOLY GHOST CAME DOWN UPON THE GENTILES
PAUL WAS FORCED TO AFFIRM AND RE-AFFIRM THIS FACT
WE DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE LAW IS BAD
IF WE WHO HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST ARE COUNTED UNRIGHTEOUS WHY SEEK JUSTIFICATION IN CHRIST AT ALL
THE ROMAN THEOLOGIANS TEACH THAT NO MAN CAN KNOW FOR A CERTAINTY WHETHER HE STANDS IN THE FAVOR OF GOD OR NOT
THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE PROVOKED TO ANGER TO ENVY TO IMPATIENCE TO CARNAL LUST AND OTHER EMOTIONS
HE WAS THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES IN A SPECIAL SENSE AS PETER WAS THE APOSTLE OF THE JEWS
BROTHER YOU CAN NEVER BE PERFECT IN THIS LIFE BUT YOU CAN BE HOLY
COVERTLY THE APOSTLE BLAMES THE FALSE APOSTLES FOR IMPEDING THE CHRISTIAN PROGRESS OF THE GALATIANS
WE PREACH THE GLAD TIDINGS OF CHRIST
116:10 THE CHRISTIANS ARE ACCUSED AND SLANDERED WITHOUT MERCY
IN A FORMER COUNCIL AT JERUSALEM HE PRACTICALLY STOOD ALONE IN DEFENSE OF THE TRUTH THAT SALVATION IS BY FAITH WITHOUT THE LAW
SOMETIMES HE ENTREATS THEM THEN AGAIN HE REPROACHES THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN ADVICE TO TIMOTHY
FORGIVENESS OF SINS TRUE RIGHTEOUSNESS PEACE OF CONSCIENCE EVERLASTING LIFE
TO LOSE THE GRACE OF GOD MEANS TO GAIN THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD DEATH THE BONDAGE OF THE DEVIL AND EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
THEY WORSHIP THEMSELVES
ALL WHO BELIEVE IN CHRIST WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE BOND OR FREE ARE SAINTS
PAUL DOES NOT CONDEMN CIRCUMCISION IN ITSELF
SIMILARLY ST JOHN CONCLUDES FROM THE WORKS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FATHER AND THE SON THAT THEY ARE DIVINELY ONE
I USED TO MAKE A LIST OF MY SINS AND I WAS ALWAYS ON THE WAY TO CONFESSION AND WHATEVER PENANCES WERE ENJOINED UPON ME I PERFORMED RELIGIOUSLY
IN THE DAYS OF FAMINE THEY SHALL BE SATISFIED PS
VARIOUS HOLY ORDERS HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING PEACE OF CONSCIENCE THROUGH RELIGIOUS EXERCISES BUT THEY PROVED FAILURES BECAUSE SUCH DEVICES ONLY INCREASE DOUBT AND DESPAIR
FOR I BEAR YOU RECORD THAT IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE YE WOULD HAVE PLUCKED OUT YOUR OWN EYES AND HAVE GIVEN THEM TO ME
MUCH LESS IS SIN TAKEN AWAY BY MAN-INVENTED ENDEAVORS
WHEN PAUL SAW THAT THE QUARREL WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND HE OBEYED THE DIRECTION OF GOD AND LEFT FOR JERUSALEM THERE TO CONFER WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES
THOUGH IT BE BUT A MAN'S COVENANT YET IF IT BE CONFIRMED NO MAN DISANNULLETH OR ADDETH THERETO
1:30 HENCE MY MANY AND GRIEVOUS SINS ARE NULLIFIED IF I BELIEVE IN HIM
IT WAS WITH HIM A MATTER OF FAITH AND DOCTRINE
THIS PASSAGE CONSTITUTES PAUL'S CHIEF DEFENSE AGAINST THE ACCUSATIONS OF HIS OPPONENTS
PEOPLE HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL OF GUESSING
BEING DEFAMED WE INTREAT
BUT YOUR CONSCIENCE LET IT ASCEND WITH ISAAC INTO THE MOUNTAIN
WE NEED CHRIST HIMSELF NOT HIS EXAMPLE TO SAVE US
PAUL DID NOT WANT TO DETRACT FROM THEIR AUTHORITY BUT HE HAD TO SPEAK DISPARAGINGLY OF THEIR AUTHORITY IN ORDER TO CONSERVE THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL AND THE LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE
CEREMONIAL LAWS ARE LIKE THE STATUTES OF GOVERNMENTS DEALING WITH PURELY CIVIL MATTERS AS COMMERCE INHERITANCE ETC
AS LONG AS THEY ARE BEING SHEPHERDED BY FAITHFUL PASTORS ALL IS WELL
CHRIST SAYS PAUL SPOILED PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS HE MADE A SHOW OF THEM OPENLY TRIUMPHING OVER THEM IN IT COL
OUR OPPONENTS IGNORE THE SEQUENCE OF LUKE'S WORDS
JUST FOR THAT THE WORLD ABHORS THE GOSPEL
4:11-13 VERSE 18
MOSES HAS HE THAT IS HANGED PAUL PUTS IT EVERY ONE THAT HANGETH ON THE OTHER HAND PAUL OMITS THE WORDS OF GOD IN HIS QUOTATION FROM MOSES
THEY LOOK FOR GRANTS AND FAVORS
BE NOT DECEIVED WARNS THE APOSTLE GOD IS NOT MOCKED GOD WILL NOT BE MOCKED IN HIS MINISTERS
THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE AND NOT THOSE WHO ARE BORN OF ABRAHAM'S FLESH AND BLOOD
BUT CONTRARIWISE WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE GOSPEL OF THE UNCIRCUMCISION WAS COMMITTED UNTO ME AS THE GOSPEL OF THE CIRCUMCISION WAS UNTO PETER
BUT THE HARDER THEY TRIED THE MORE THEY WORRIED
WHAT DID PEOPLE DO ABOUT THEIR SINS BEFORE THESE NEW INVENTIONS WERE HATCHED UP
ARE YE SO FOOLISH THAT AFTER YE HAVE BEGUN IN THE SPIRIT YE WOULD NOW END IN THE FLESH FLESH STANDS FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF REASON WHICH SEEKS JUSTIFICATION BY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE LAW
THE APPROVAL OF HIS OWN GOOD CONSCIENCE IS THE BEST PRAISE A MINISTER CAN HAVE
WE ARE CAREFUL TO APPLY THE GOSPEL AND THE LAW IN THEIR PROPER TURN
THE APOSTLE JAMES SAYS FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL KEEP THE WHOLE LAW AND YET OFFEND IN ONE POINT HE IS GUILTY OF ALL THIS PASSAGE SUPPORTS US OVER AGAINST OUR CRITICS WHO CLAIM THAT WE DISREGARD ALL CHARITY TO THE GREAT INJURY OF THE CHURCHES
INDIRECTLY HE ALSO REMINDS THEM HOW MUCH THEY HAD LOVED HIM BEFORE THE INVASION OF THE FALSE APOSTLES AND GIVES THEM A HINT THAT THEY SHOULD RETURN TO THEIR FIRST LOVE FOR HIM
WHO HATH BEWITCHED YOU
WE WILL ALWAYS AFFIRM WITH PAUL THAT EITHER CHRIST DIED IN VAIN OR ELSE THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY US
WHY IS IT THAT MAN'S LAST WILL IS SCRUPULOUSLY RESPECTED AND NOT GOD'S TESTAMENT
AS FOR EVERLASTING LIFE TEMPORAL BLESSINGS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
I CAN FIND PLENTY OF EXAMPLES FOR A HOLY LIFE IN ABRAHAM ISAIAH JOHN THE BAPTIST PAUL AND OTHER SAINTS
VERSES 7 8
DO NOT DESPAIR LIKE CAIN SAUL OR JUDAS
BUT CARNAL LUST IS NOT THE ONLY WORK OF THE FLESH AND SO HE COUNTS AMONG THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ALSO IDOLATRY WITCHCRAFT HATRED AND THE LIKE
THIS HE DID OUT OF HIS GREAT LOVE FOR ME FOR THE APOSTLE SAYS WHO LOVED ME DID THE LAW EVER LOVE ME
NOW IF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW HAD BEEN WORTH ANYTHING I WOULD NEVER HAVE FORSAKEN IT
THE JEWS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH DAY THE NEW MOONS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES AND OTHER FEASTS
NO TRUE BELIEVER TRUSTS IN HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT SAYS WITH DAVID ENTER NOT INTO JUDGMENT WITH THY SERVANT
WHO LOVED ME AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME
EVERY TEACHER OF WORK-RIGHTEOUSNESS IS A TROUBLE-MAKER
INSTEAD HE SHED HIS BLOOD ABUNDANTLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GIVE ABUNDANT SATISFACTION FOR OUR SINS
IT CONDEMNS ALL WHO DO NOT ACCOMPLISH THE WILL OF GOD
PAUL COMPARES THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW TO OXEN THAT ARE HITCHED TO THE YOKE
THE APOSTLE CONTINUES HIS PRAISE OF THE GALATIANS
IF YOU LIVE ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF SAINT FRANCIS SAINT DOMINICK SAINT BENEDICT YOU WILL OBTAIN THE PEACE AND MERCY OF GOD
SISTER YOU ARE NOW IN JAIL ALL RIGHT
PAUL WANTS US TO UNDERSTAND THAT CHRIST IS THE MEDIATOR OF A BETTER TESTAMENT THAN MEDIATOR MOSES OF THE LAW
ON THE CONTRARY YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME
VERSE 18
VERSE 18
VERSE 18
IN THAT WAY ALL THE GENTILES COULD BE GIVEN TO HIM FOR AN INHERITANCE
THERE MUST BE PEOPLE IN HIGH OFFICE OF COURSE
CHRIST ALONE CAN HARMONIZE THESE CONTRADICTIONS
HE OF GOD IS MADE UNTO US WISDOM AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SANCTIFICATION AND REDEMPTION I COR
AS SUCH TIMES WE ARE TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST AS IF THERE WERE NO LAW OR SIN ANYWHERE BUT ONLY CHRIST
YOU MAY ARGUE ABOUT KNOWLEDGE ART MONEY COUNTRIES AND THE LIKE WITHOUT DOING PARTICULAR HARM
19:15 THIS QUOTATION FROM MOSES OUGHT TO SHUT THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
NOT HAVING MINE OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS OF THE LAW BUT THAT WHICH IS THROUGH THE FAITH OF CHRIST PHIL
AND IT WAS ORDAINED BY ANGELS IN THE HAND OF A MEDIATOR
YOU GALATIANS WERE VERY GOOD TO ME
ABRAHAM WAS ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE FAITH PERVADED HIS WHOLE PERSONALITY AND HIS EVERY ACTION
THAT THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW CAN BE SEEN FROM THE ACCOUNT OF THE GIVING OF THE LAW AS REPORTED IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CHAPTERS OF EXODUS
WE MUST LOOK AWAY FROM OUR OWN PERSON
VERSE 24
VERSE 24
VERSE 24
VERSE 24
THE SINNER NEEDS A BETTER MEDIATOR
CHRIST IS NO MOSES NO LAW-GIVER NO TYRANT BUT THE MEDIATOR FOR SINS THE GIVER OF GRACE AND LIFE
THESE OBJECT LESSONS OF GOD SHOULD CONVINCE US THAT OF ALL THINGS GOD HATES PRIDE
HE COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MILDER EXPRESSION THAN THIS I MARVEL IT INDICATES HIS SORROW AND HIS DISPLEASURE
SOMETIMES ONE LONE PERSON CAN DO MORE IN A CONFERENCE THAN THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY
IF WE COULD LOVE GOD WITH ALL OUR HEART WE SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE JUSTIFIED BY OUR OBEDIENCE FOR IT IS WRITTEN WHICH IF A MAN DO HE SHALL LIVE IN THEM LEV
FOR BRETHREN YE HAVE BEEN CALLED UNTO LIBERTY
WHAT ARE THESE FALSE APOSTLES DOING PAUL CRIES
THIS READING ALSO PRESERVES THE IMPLIED CRITICISM THAT THE GALATIANS WITHDREW THEMSELVES FROM THAT CHRIST WHO HAD CALLED THEM NOT UNTO THE LAW BUT UNTO GRACE
YOU HAVE GOT TO SHOUT LOUDER MR LAW
THE LAW CANNOT GIVE LIFE
MY SPEECH IS NO LONGER DIRECTED BY THE FLESH BUT BY THE HOLY GHOST
EVERY TITTLE OF IT IS GREATER THAN HEAVEN AND EARTH
54:8 WE SHALL APPRECIATE THIS LIBERTY ALL THE MORE WHEN WE BEAR IN MIND THAT IT WAS JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WHO PURCHASED IT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD
NOW WHAT KIND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THIS WHEN WE REFRAIN FROM EVIL OUT OF FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
IN THE PAPACY APPEARANCE COUNTS FOR EVERYTHING
ALTHOUGH I AM A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND HAVE PREACHED CHRIST AND FOUGHT HIS BATTLES FOR A LONG TIME I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO HOLD FAST TO THE TRUTH
THIS MONSTER OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS THIS STIFF-NECKED BEAST NEEDS A BIG AXE
HE EMBELLISHES MY FAITH
WE WHO ARE BORN OF THE GOSPEL AND LIVE IN CHRIST AND REJOICE IN OUR INHERITANCE HAVE ISHMAEL FOR OUR ENEMY
IN THE MIDST OF THE CLAMOR THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST CRIES IN OUR HEARTS
WE KEEP THEM FAR APART
WHEN I BEGAN TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO YOU IN THE INFIRMITY OF MY FLESH AND IN GREAT TEMPTATION YOU WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED
HE REMINDS THE GALATIANS HOW HE WAS ALWAYS IN PERIL AT THE HANDS OF THE JEWS GENTILES AND FALSE BRETHREN HOW HE SUFFERED HUNGER AND WANT
YOU ARE A SINNER
IF FAITH LACKS LOVE IT IS NOT TRUE FAITH
AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD WE ARE THE HEIRS OF HIS ETERNAL HEAVEN
NEVERTHELESS GOD HAS PUNISHED THE CONTEMPT OF THE GOSPEL AND OF CHRIST ON THE PART OF THE PAPISTS BY TURNING THEM OVER TO A REPROBATE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH THEY REJECT THE GOSPEL AND RECEIVE WITH GUSTO THE ABOMINABLE RULES ORDINANCES AND TRADITIONS OF MEN IN PREFERENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD UNTIL THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO FORBID MARRIAGE
ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG BEFORE CHRIST WAS BORN
BUT WHEN HE CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN HE WAS A LAWGIVER
IN CHRIST JESUS I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU THROUGH THE GOSPEL
WHO IS GOING TO HELP ME IN DUE TIME COMES THE WORD OF THE GOSPEL AND SAYS
NO WONDER THEY FAILED TO UNDERSTAND PAUL
PAUL IS INCENSED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE TYRANNY OF THE LAW
IN HIS ABSENCE THE FALSE APOSTLES WENT TO WORK IN GALATIA
INDEED NOT
THAT HE MIGHT DELIVER US FROM THIS PRESENT EVIL WORLD
THESE ARE THE AFFIDAVITS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TESTIFYING TO OUR FAVORABLE STANDING WITH GOD
MOSES CAME ALONG AND HE WAS MADE THE MEDIATOR
THE FAULT LIES WITH THE ANABAPTISTS AND OTHER FANATICS
THE MONK FANCIES HE IS DOING THE WILL OF GOD IF HE PERFORMS HIS VOWS
HE USES THE LAW TO BRING LIFE
I HAVE PROMISED GOD A THOUSAND TIMES THAT I WOULD BECOME A BETTER MAN BUT I NEVER KEPT MY PROMISE
BUT THEY CANNOT FORGIVE MY SINS
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A SCHOOLMASTER WHO COULD ONLY TORMENT AND BEAT A CHILD
EVERY SMALL OFFENSE IS CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED
LEAVE OFF THIS FOOLISHNESS AND LISTEN TO ME
PAUL'S LANGUAGE IS DIFFERENT
AND YET MANY DEVOTE MUCH TIME AND LABOR TO THE LAW TO THE DECREES OF THE FATHERS AND TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE POPE
FAITH TRULY HONORS GOD
IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT PAUL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION FOR IN BIDDING THE GALATIANS TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT HE AT THE SAME TIME DENIES THAT GOOD WORKS CAN JUSTIFY
WHEN MEN EMBRACE ERRORS THE TIE OF CHRISTIAN LOVE IS BROKEN
HIS ANGER BURSTS FORTH IN ELEMENTAL FURY AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS EPISTLE
CHRIST FORESAW THE REACTION OF THE WORLD TO THE GOSPEL
THIS NINETEENTH VERSE IS LOADED WITH CONSOLATION
BROTHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO FEEL GOD'S FAVOR AS YOU FEEL YOUR SIN
THEY TEACH WHATEVER IS AGREEABLE TO MEN NO MATTER WHETHER IT IS CONTRARY TO GOD'S WORD OR THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE
WE DESPISE THE GRACE OF GOD WHEN WE OBSERVE THE LAW FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING JUSTIFIED
THIS DOCTRINE DIFFERS GREATLY FROM THE LAW
BECAUSE THE EYES DO NOT JUSTIFY WOULD YOU HAVE THEM TAKEN OUT
FOR THEY DRANK OF THAT SPIRITUAL ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM
SHOULD HE BE MADE EQUAL TO US WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED LONG BEFORE THE TIME OF MOSES GOD JUSTIFIED MEN WITHOUT THE LAW
HE IS NOT PERMITTED TO ORDER HIS OWN AFFAIRS
AND THEY WHICH WAIT AT THE ALTAR ARE PARTAKERS WITH THE ALTAR
I MAY LIVE IN THE FLESH BUT I DO NOT LIVE AFTER THE FLESH
IF IN THIS MATTER WE WERE TO HUMBLE OURSELVES THEY WOULD TAKE FROM US THE GOD WHO CREATED US AND JESUS CHRIST WHO HAS REDEEMED US BY HIS BLOOD
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TRIED IN THE FURNACE OF AFFLICTION THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY EQUIPPED WITH THE ARMOR OF GOD AND KNOW NOT HOW TO USE THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT
THINKING HE KNOWS ENOUGH A PERSON BEGINS LITTLE BY LITTLE TO DESPISE THE WORD UNTIL HE HAS LOST CHRIST AND THE GOSPEL ALTOGETHER
ALL PRIESTS MONKS AND NUNS--AND I AM NOW SPEAKING OF THE BEST OF THEM--WHO REPOSE THEIR HOPE FOR SALVATION IN THEIR OWN WORKS AND NOT IN CHRIST WHOM THEY IMAGINE TO BE AN ANGRY JUDGE HEAR THIS SENTENCE PRONOUNCED AGAINST THEM THAT CHRIST SHALL PROFIT THEM NOTHING
THEY HATED ME WITHOUT CAUSE AND FOR MY LOVE THEY ARE MY ADVERSARIES
DO NOT FOR A MOMENT THINK THAT I AM REVERSING MYSELF ON MY STAND CONCERNING FAITH
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH JUDAS
HE MEANS TO SAY LET US DO GOOD NOT ONLY TO THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL BUT TO EVERYBODY AND LET US DO IT WITHOUT WEARINESS IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO DO GOOD ONCE OR TWICE BUT TO KEEP ON DOING GOOD WITHOUT GETTING DISGUSTED WITH THE INGRATITUDE OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE BENEFITED THAT IS NOT SO EASY
THIS IMPRESSION IS INSTINCTIVE AND THEREFORE DOUBLY DANGEROUS
BUT I COME TO THEE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD OF HOSTS THE GOD OF THE ARMIES OF ISRAEL WHOM THOU HAST DEFIED
IF YOU SET THE WORD OUT OF SIGHT YOU ARE HELPLESS AGAINST THE FLESH
THEY JUST SIT AND DO NOTHING
BUT NOT ALL PEOPLE KNOW IT OR WANT TO KNOW IT
THIS INNER ASSURANCE OF THE GRACE OF GOD IS ACCOMPANIED BY OUTWARD INDICATIONS SUCH AS GLADLY TO HEAR PREACH PRAISE AND TO CONFESS CHRIST TO DO ONE'S DUTY IN THE STATION IN WHICH GOD HAS PLACED US TO AID THE NEEDY AND TO COMFORT THE SORROWING
ONLY FOR A TIME UNTIL THE BOY HAS BEEN TRAINED TO BE A WORTHY HEIR OF HIS FATHER
ON ONE OCCASION JESUS REMARKED
BUT WHEN I SAW THAT THEY WALKED NOT UPRIGHTLY ACCORDING TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
THEY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST OR THE LAW OF CHRIST
TO DIVIDE LAW AND GOSPEL MEANS TO PLACE THE GOSPEL IN HEAVEN AND TO KEEP THE LAW ON EARTH
TO TRUST IN OUR OWN STRENGTH OUR OWN GOODNESS OUR OWN WISDOM IS A PERILOUS THING
MURDERERS ADULTERERS THIEVES DISGUISE THEMSELVES
WE DO NOT PREACH FOR THE PRAISE OF MEN OR THE FAVOR OF PRINCES
THE PERSON WHO CAN RIGHTLY DIVIDE LAW AND GOSPEL HAS REASON TO THANK GOD
ACCORDING TO THE LAW AS IN ROMANS 13:14 PUT YE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHICH MEANS TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST
HOW DOES IT COME THAT YOU DO NOT GROW THE SAME FRUITS NOW
MAN CANNOT STAND THE LAW WITHOUT A VEIL OVER IT
AND HOW MUCH DID I NOT PRAISE AND COMMEND YOU FORMERLY PAUL REMINDS THEM OF FORMER AND BETTER TIMES IN AN EFFORT TO MITIGATE HIS SHARP REPROACHES LEST THE FALSE APOSTLES SHOULD SLANDER HIM AND MISCONSTRUE HIS LETTER TO HIS DISADVANTAGE AND TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE
YET THE LAW CONTINUES TO EXIST AND TO FUNCTION
HE DID THIS NOT FOR HIS OWN SAKE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE
THEY SAY NATURE IS DEPRAVED BUT THE QUALITIES OF NATURE ARE UNTAINTED
IN THIS TERSE MANNER PAUL PRESENTS THE WHOLE LIFE OF A CHRISTIAN
PAUL DOES NOT ENUMERATE ALL THE WORKS OF THE FLESH BUT ONLY CERTAIN ONES
AND I WENT UP BY REVELATION
MIRACLES
TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBOR TO DO GOOD TO THEM THAT PERSECUTE YOU TO PRAY FOR ONE'S ENEMIES PATIENTLY TO BEAR THE INGRATITUDE OF THOSE WHO RETURN EVIL FOR GOOD IS CERTAINLY PRAISEWORTHY
HE MAINTAINS UNDER OATH THAT HE RECEIVED HIS GOSPEL NOT FROM MEN BUT BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST
WHEN HE WAS WITH YOU HE ACTED LIKE A FATHER BUT NOW HE ACTS LIKE A DICTATOR PAUL KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT OF THE FALSE APOSTLES AND THEREFORE HE IS WORRIED
PAUL MAKES IT CLEAR ENOUGH THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN AN ABRAHAMIC PEDIGREE TO BE A CHILD OF GOD
BUT AMONG FRIENDS IT IS NOT SO MUCH LESS AMONG CHRISTIANS
PAUL DEVOTES THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS TO A DEFENSE OF HIS OFFICE AND HIS GOSPEL AFFIRMING THAT HE RECEIVED IT NOT FROM MEN BUT FROM THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BY SPECIAL REVELATION AND THAT IF HE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL THAN THE ONE HE HAD PREACHED HE SHALL BE ACCURSED
HENCE THE GERMAN PROVERB
PAUL HAD PREACHED THE GOSPEL THROUGHOUT GALATIA FOUNDING MANY CHURCHES WHICH AFTER HIS DEPARTURE WERE INVADED BY THE FALSE APOSTLES
THEY LIVED MORAL LIVES
A MEDIATOR IS NOT A MEDIATOR OF ONE MOSES COULD NOT BE A MEDIATOR OF GOD ONLY FOR GOD NEEDS NO MEDIATOR
THIS DOCTRINE BRINGS COMFORT TO CONSCIENCES IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
AND IN THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
THE PROPHET JONAH WRITES
HIS FAITH WAS AT LOW EBB
THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW IS TO REVEAL SIN
DESPAIR NOT BUT RESIST THE FLESH I REMEMBER HOW DOCTOR STAUPITZ USED TO SAY TO ME
LET US NOT BE HARD ON THEM
THE DEVIL IS A CUNNING PERSUADER
AS A RESULT WE HAVE THIS PARADOXICAL SITUATION
NOT IN ITSELF OF COURSE BUT IN US
IN WRITING TO THE CORINTHIANS HE NEEDED TWO CHAPTERS TO IMPRESS THIS MATTER UPON THEM
HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
MOSES BROUGHT THE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR TENTS TO HAVE GOD SPEAK TO THEM PERSONALLY FROM A CLOUD
BY FLESH PAUL UNDERSTANDS WHAT JESUS MEANT IN THE THIRD CHAPTER OF JOHN THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE FLESH IS FLESH JOHN 3:6 FLESH HERE MEANS THE WHOLE NATURE OF MAN INCLUSIVE OF REASON AND INSTINCTS
THE LIBERTY WHICH CHRIST PURCHASED FOR US IS A BULWARK TO US IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST SPIRITUAL TYRANNY
THE FACT IS HE RESISTED THOSE WHO WANTED TO FORCE THE PRACTICE OF THE LAW UPON THE GENTILES
GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST IN COMBINING THEM HE ASCRIBES THEM EQUALLY TO THE FATHER AND THE SON
BUT MEN NEED DETERRING EXAMPLES
BY NATURE ALL MEN KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD BECAUSE THAT WHICH MAY BE KNOWN OF GOD IS MANIFEST IN THEM FOR GOD HATH SHOWED IT UNTO THEM
I WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT CHRIST'S GOSPEL BE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND THAT MANY MANY BE BROUGHT TO FAITH IN HIM VERSE 6
THE MAN THAT DOETH THEM SHALL LIVE IN THEM THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH IS TO BELIEVE THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE PASSAGE
ANY OTHER DOCTRINE MUST BE FALSE AND WICKED WITH PAUL WE BOLDLY PRONOUNCE A CURSE UPON EVERY DOCTRINE THAT DOES NOT AGREE WITH OURS
TO REASON IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT CHRIST SHOULD OFFER HIS BODY AND BLOOD IN THE LORD'S SUPPER
I WILL SERVE GOD IN SUCH AND SUCH A WAY
THERE ARE A FEW ON OUR SIDE WHO LOVE AND REVERE US FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD BUT FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE THERE ARE A HUNDRED ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO HATE AND PERSECUTE US
OUR MERCIFUL FATHER IN HEAVEN SAW HOW THE LAW OPPRESSED US AND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS FOR US TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE CURSE OF THE LAW
WE WOULD NOT FEEL SO BAD WHEN WE LOSE THEM
IF GOD IS ANGRY WITH YOU HE WILL DESTROY AND CONDEMN YOU FOREVER
THEY CALL IT CHARITY INFUSED THIS CHARITY IS SUPPOSED TO REMAIN IN THE HEART
HOWBEIT THEN WHEN YE KNEW NOT GOD YE DID SERVICE UNTO THEM WHICH BY NATURE ARE NO GODS
BUT LET US FIRST FIND OUT WHO THE DOERS OF THE LAW ARE
SINCE THEN THE WHOLE WORLD HAS BEEN UPSET
AS THE OBJECT OF THE EMOTION AND HOPE AS THE EMOTION ITSELF
WE TEACH THAT ALL MEN ARE NATURALLY DEPRAVED
THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW IS TO KILL
IF CHRIST BEARS OUR SINS WE DO NOT BEAR THEM
ALTHOUGH HE WAS THE LORD OF THE LAW HE VOLUNTARILY PLACED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW AND PERMITTED IT TO EXERCISE DOMINION OVER HIM INDEED TO ACCUSE AND TO CONDEMN HIM
HE IS AN ANTICHRIST BECAUSE HE ASCRIBES TO HIS OWN WORKS THE OMNIPOTENT CAPABILITY OF CONQUERING SIN DEATH DEVIL HELL AND THE WRATH OF GOD
THAT THE CHOSEN VESSEL OF CHRIST SHOULD HAVE HAD THE LAW OF SIN IN HIS MEMBERS SEEMS TO THEM INCREDIBLE AND ABSURD
NONE WAS GREATER THAN THE OTHER NONE COULD POINT TO PREROGATIVES ABOVE THE OTHER
IF HIS DEATH WAS WORTH WHILE IT FOLLOWS THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS DOES NOT COME BY THE LAW
FOR ITS INSOLENCE THE LAW IN TURN WAS ARRAIGNED BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF GOD AND CONDEMNED
WE ARE NOT THE HEIRS OF SOME RICH AND MIGHTY MAN BUT HEIRS OF GOD THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR OF ALL THINGS
OFTEN THOSE WHO SHOULD BE HIS BEST FRIENDS ARE HIS WORST ENEMIES
FOR IT IS A VICE WITH US TO ESTEEM PERSONALITY MORE HIGHLY THAN THE WORD OF GOD
BY THIS ABOMINABLE DOCTRINE ANTICHRIST HAS SPOILED DARKENED AND BURIED THE BENEFIT OF CHRIST AND IN PLACE OF THE GRACE OF CHRIST AND HIS KINGDOM HE HAS ESTABLISHED THE DOCTRINE OF WORKS AND THE KINGDOM OF CEREMONIES
HAVE YOU PUT DOWN THE TYRANNY OF THE POPE AND OBTAINED LIBERTY IN CHRIST THROUGH THE ANABAPTISTS AND OTHER FANATICS
FAITH IS THE DIVINITY OF WORKS
THE CHURCH IS A TENDER PLANT
THE GALATIANS WERE HINDERED IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE WHEN THEY TURNED FROM FAITH AND GRACE TO THE LAW
LET US DO EVIL THAT GOOD MAY COME OF IT WHAT ARE WE TO DO
I WILL NOT BURDEN THE GENTILES WITH THE LAW BECAUSE I AM THEIR APOSTLE AND NOT THEIR LAWGIVER
PAUL NEVER SAW JESUS IN THE FLESH
THE SOPHISTICAL PAPISTS ASSERT THAT A PERSON IS ABLE BY NATURAL STRENGTH TO LOVE GOD LONG BEFORE GRACE HAS ENTERED HIS HEART AND TO PERFORM WORKS OF REAL MERIT
VERSES 4 5
IN THIS VERSE THE APOSTLE SUMMARIZES HIS INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PROPER SUPPORT OF THE MINISTERS AND OF THE POOR
YOU POPE I WILL NOT HAVE YOU FOR MY BOSS FOR I AM SURE THAT MY DOCTRINE IS DIVINE SUCH PRIDE AGAINST THE POPE IS IMPERATIVE FOR IF WE ARE NOT STOUT AND PROUD WE SHALL NEVER SUCCEED IN DEFENDING THE ARTICLE OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH
WHERE IS THEN THE BLESSEDNESS YE SPAKE OF
PAUL AND BARNABAS STOOD UP FOR THE TRUTH
THESE TWO LEADERS THE FLESH AND THE SPIRIT ARE BITTER OPPONENTS
WHAT GOD HAS ONCE PROMISED HE DOES NOT TAKE BACK
IT MERELY REBUKES THE INGRATITUDE OF MEN
IF I WERE ANXIOUS FOR THE FAVOR OF MEN I WOULD FLATTER THEM
HOPE IS A SOLDIER
HAPPY THE PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO UTILIZE THE LAW SO THAT IT SERVES THE PURPOSES OF GRACE AND OF FAITH
A TRUE SAINT CONFESSES HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PRAYS THAT HIS SINS MAY BE FORGIVEN
PAUL'S STATEMENT IN THIS VERSE MAY BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO CIRCUMCISION ARE THEREBY SUBMITTING TO THE WHOLE LAW
LET EVERY PERSON DO HIS DUTY IN THE STATION OF LIFE INTO WHICH GOD HAS CALLED HIM
PAUL IN THIS VERSE DISCLOSES THAT HE IS NOT SPEAKING SO MUCH OF CIRCUMCISION AS THE TRUST WHICH MEN REPOSE IN THE OUTWARD ACT
FOR IN THY SIGHT SHALL NO MAN LIVING BE JUSTIFIED PS
PAUL MINUTELY RECOUNTS HIS PERSONAL HISTORY TO STOP THE CAVIL OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
IF THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY IT IS GOOD FOR NOTHING
PEOPLE SAY
YOU HAVE NOT INCURRED THE HATRED AND PERSECUTIONS OF THE WORLD
AS CARNAL LUST IS STRONG IN A YOUNG MAN IN A MAN OF FULL AGE THE DESIRE FOR GLORY AND IN AN OLD MAN COVETOUSNESS SO IMPATIENCE DOUBT AND HATRED OF GOD OFTEN PREVAIL IN THE HEARTS OF SINCERE CHRISTIANS
THE FIRST FAULT WITH CIRCUMCISION IS THAT IT MAKES CHRIST UNPROFITABLE
AFTER HIS DEATH THE TESTAMENT WAS OPENED IT WAS PUBLISHED TO THE NATIONS
THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY THE FAITH OF CHRIST AND NOT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
PAUL DOES NOT ACCUSE PETER OF MALICE OR IGNORANCE BUT OF LACK OF PRINCIPLE IN THAT HE ABSTAINED FROM MEATS BECAUSE HE FEARED THE JEWS THAT CAME FROM JAMES
IT DEPOSES THE CREATOR AND DEIFIES THE CREATURE
TRUE CHRISTIANS ARE MORE READY TO BELIEVE IN MEN THAN THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD
GOD FORBID SAYS THE APOSTLE THAT I SHOULD GLORY IN ANYTHING AS DANGEROUS AS THE FALSE APOSTLES GLORY IN BECAUSE WHAT THEY GLORY IN IS A POISON THAT DESTROYS MANY SOULS AND I WISH IT WERE BURIED IN HELL
CHARITY TRUSTS IN MEN AND IS OFTEN WRONG
WE MAY OVERLOOK THE OFFENSES AND ERRORS OF LIFE FOR WE DAILY SIN MUCH
IN THE PAPACY I SAW THE PEOPLE GIVE GENEROUSLY FOR THE ERECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF LUXURIOUS CHURCH BUILDINGS AND FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF MEN APPOINTED TO THE IDOLATROUS SERVICE OF ROME
WITH CHRIST ON OUR SIDE WE CAN DEFY HIM AND SAY
AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER HE ANSWERED GOD FLIPPANTLY
IT IS MARVELOUS HOW GOD PRESERVED THE CHURCH BY ONE SINGLE PERSON
GOD NEVER SAID TO ABRAHAM
BY REVEALING THE EVIL THAT IS IN US IT CREATES A LONGING IN THE HEART FOR THE BETTER THINGS OF GOD
THUS I LIVE THE APOSTLE STARTS OUT
THEY REMAIN UNDER THE LAW SIN DEATH AND THE POWER OF THE DEVIL
IT WILL EASE OUR SUFFERINGS AND MAKE THEM LIGHT AS CHRIST SAYS MATTHEW 11:30 MY YOKE IS EASY AND MY BURDEN IS LIGHT VERSE 14
WHEREFORE THEN SERVETH THE LAW WITH THE WORDS
LET ALL WHO LOVE AND FEAR GOD DILIGENTLY LEARN THE DIFFERENCE NOT ONLY IN THEORY BUT ALSO IN PRACTICE
AFTER ALL IT IS A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT EVEN SAINTS MIGHT AND DO SIN
JUST BECAUSE THE LAW INCREASES SIN IT DOES NOT THEREFORE OBSTRUCT THE PROMISES OF GOD
SUCH CONFIDENCE IS ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
ABRAHAM MAY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD STANDING WITH MEN FOR HIS UPRIGHT LIFE BUT NOT WITH GOD
THE SILLY CONSCIENCE MUST BE EDUCATED TO THIS
IF THE GENTILES WERE JUSTIFIED WITHOUT THE LAW AND QUIETLY RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT AT A TIME WHEN THE LAW WAS IN FULL FORCE WHY SHOULD THE LAW COUNT UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS NOW NOW THAT CHRIST HAS FULFILLED THE LAW
ALL THIS IS OF WONDERFUL COMFORT TO A CONSCIENCE TROUBLED BY THE ENORMITY OF SIN
THAT MEANS YOU ARE NO LONGER IN THE KINGDOM OR CONDITION OF GRACE
WHERE THIS VIRTUE IS LACKING MEN ARE SUSPICIOUS FORWARD AND WAYWARD AND WILL BELIEVE NOTHING NOR YIELD TO ANYBODY
WHEN PAUL DECLARES THAT WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW HE MEANS THE WHOLE LAW PARTICULARLY THE MORAL LAW WHICH MORE THAN THE OTHER LAWS ACCUSES CURSES AND CONDEMNS THE CONSCIENCE
BUT THEY WILL NOT DO THE THINGS TO WHICH THE FLESH INCITES THEM
OTHERWISE WHY THE NEED OF PROMISES
YOU STARTED ALL THIS AND THEN THE PEOPLE STARTED IN ON MOSES
CIRCUMCISION IS NOT INJURIOUS TO THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT ASCRIBE ANY PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO IT
ALLEGORIES ARE NOT VERY CONVINCING BUT LIKE PICTURES THEY VISUALIZE A MATTER
THIS IS WHAT THEY GET FOR LIVING IN THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND NOT IN THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD
DID THE LAW EVER DIE FOR ME
THIS GOES TO SHOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BELIEVE
BUT PERHAPS GOD DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE THE MOTHER OF ABRAHAM'S POSTERITY
THE LAW IS A CIVIL AND A SPIRITUAL PRISON
IN ORDER TO POINT OUT THE TRUE OFFICE OF THE LAW AND THUS TO STAMP OUT THAT FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW PAUL ANSWERS THE QUESTION
AT ONE TIME THE EMPEROR WAS COMPELLED TO GRANT TO THE BISHOP OF ROME CERTAIN IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES
THE LAW IS A PRISON TO BE FEARED AND HATED
THE DIVINE POWER OF GOD ALONE CAN DESTROY SIN AND DEATH AND CREATE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE
HE IS GOING TO HATE GOD DESPISE HIS GRACE AND MERCY AND IGNORE THE PROMISES IN CHRIST
THAT WE MIGHT RECEIVE THE ADOPTION OF SONS
THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THE LAW AND ITS MOST VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION
THEY THINK THEY ARE PERFORMING THE LAW BUT THEY ARE NOT
HOWEVER WE LEARN FROM THE WORD OF GOD THAT THERE IS NOTHING UNDER THE SUN THAT CAN MAKE US RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD AND A NEW CREATURE EXCEPT CHRIST JESUS
NEITHER CAN WE RENDER ADEQUATE SATISFACTION FOR OUR OFFENSES
BUT THE ATTACKS OF THE OLD SERPENT ARE NOT WITHOUT PROFIT TO US FOR THEY CONFIRM OUR DOCTRINE AND STRENGTHEN OUR FAITH IN CHRIST
NO WONDER PAUL GREATLY DESIRED TO DEPART AND TO BE WITH CHRIST
FOR IT IS WRITTEN CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM
HE MEANS TO SAY
WHEN HE QUOTES SCRIPTURE TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL NATIONS THAT SHARE THE FAITH OF FAITHFUL ABRAHAM ARE TO BE BLESSED PAUL MEANS TO IMPLY THE CONTRAST THAT ALL NATIONS ARE ACCURSED WITHOUT FAITH IN CHRIST
IT IS DIFFERENT WITH THE SPOKEN WORD
CHRIST IN WHOM I DO BELIEVE MAKES ME WORTHY
THE LAW DISPELS ALL SELF-ILLUSIONS
LET US REALIZE THAT WE TOO MAY BE SEDUCED BY SATAN
THOU SHALT THOU SHALT NOT THE PROMISE OF THE SEED PLEADS
IN THE MATTER OF SALVATION RANK LEARNING RIGHTEOUSNESS INFLUENCE COUNT FOR NOTHING
BUT JERUSALEM WHICH IS ABOVE IS FREE WHICH IS THE MOTHER OF US ALL
YE SEE HOW LARGE A LETTER I HAVE WRITTEN UNTO YOU WITH MINE OWN HAND
AS IF HE WERE SAYING TO THE GALATIANS
THE WORD TESTAMENT IS ANOTHER NAME FOR THE PROMISE THAT GOD MADE UNTO ABRAHAM CONCERNING CHRIST
NO WONDER PAUL EXHORTS ALL MINISTERS OF THE WORD TO GUARD AGAINST THIS POISON
YOU GIVE THEM REASON TO THINK THAT FAITH IS NOT SUFFICIENT UNTO SALVATION PETER DID NOT SAY SO BUT HIS EXAMPLE SAID QUITE PLAINLY THAT THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW MUST BE ADDED TO FAITH IN CHRIST IF MEN ARE TO BE SAVED
WHY IS HE SO QUICK TO PRONOUNCE DAMNATION UPON HIS BRETHREN IN THE MINISTRY
SINCE THIS IS THE UNMISTAKABLE TESTIMONY OF HOLY WRIT WHY DO YOU TAKE YOUR STAND UPON CIRCUMCISION AND THE LAW
FAITH IS NEITHER LAW NOR WORD
HE TREATS OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS VERY NECESSARY
THIS PASSAGE MAY ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER WORK BESIDES THE MINISTRY
YES THE BETTER CHRISTIAN A MAN IS THE MORE HE WILL EXPERIENCE THE HEAT OF THE CONFLICT
NOW THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT PART OF HIS EPISTLE HAS BEEN FINISHED HE REALIZES THAT HE HAS HANDLED THE GALATIANS TOO ROUGHLY
GOD PUNISHED THEM JUSTLY BECAUSE THEY BLASPHEMED THE ONLY SON OF GOD
WE NEED A REDEEMING NOT AN EXEMPLARY CHRIST TO SAVE US
THAT CHRIST IS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD WOULD BE A MYTH
WE DEPEND UPON GOD FOR SALVATION
WE LOVE THE LAW ABOUT AS WELL AS A MURDERER LOVES HIS GLOOMY CELL HIS STRAIGHT-JACKET AND THE IRON BARS IN FRONT OF HIM
FAITH PRESUPPOSES THE ASSURANCE OF GOD'S MERCY
THE LAW OF CHRIST IS THE LAW OF LOVE
REASON TAKES OFFENSE AT THE BREVITY WITH WHICH PAUL TREATS THE LAW
PAUL ANSWERS THIS QUESTION NEXT
WE KNOW THAT PAUL OBSERVED THESE DECORA OUT OF CHARITABLE REGARD FOR THE WEAK BRETHREN
THERE IS NO WRONG THAT IS NOT LAID TO OUR CHARGE
FIRST BECAUSE THOU ART THE SON OF GOD
IN SHORT CHRIST WAS CHARGED WITH THE SINS OF ALL MEN THAT HE SHOULD PAY FOR THEM WITH HIS OWN BLOOD
WITHIN ITS PROPER SPHERE THE LAW IS AN EXCELLENT THING
WHAT HAPPENED
A TRUE FRIEND WILL ADMONISH HIS ERRING BROTHER AND IF THE ERRING BROTHER HAS ANY SENSE AT ALL HE WILL THANK HIS FRIEND
WHEREVER THIS OPINION HOLDS SWAY THE PROMISES OF GOD ARE DENIED CHRIST IS DEMOTED HYPOCRISY AND IDOLATRY ARE ESTABLISHED
I LIKE IT WELL HE SAID THAT THE DOCTRINE WHICH YOU PROCLAIM GIVES GLORY TO GOD ALONE AND NONE TO MAN
HE CITED THE CASE OF THE FATHERS
THIS FAITH IN CHRIST IS ENGENDERED BY THE GOSPEL AS THE APOSTLE DECLARES IN I CORINTHIANS 4:15
THIS SIMILE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER IS STRIKING
MOSES WAS MERELY A MEDIATOR OF THE VEIL
WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SAW THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN BURNING AND SMOKING THE BLACK CLOUDS RENT BY FIERCE LIGHTNING FLASHING UP AND DOWN IN THE INKY DARKNESS WHEN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET BLOWING LOUDER AND LONGER SHATTERED BY THE ROLL OF THUNDER THEY WERE SO FRIGHTENED THAT THEY BEGGED MOSES
IN SHORT THEY PULL GOD FROM HIS THRONE AND PERCH THEMSELVES ON IT
IT CONTINUES TO DO WELL EVEN TO THE UNGRATEFUL
HE SAYS WE DID NOT LET GO OF THE LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS
THEY GRANT THAT ANY ACT IS FAULTY UNLESS IT PROCEEDS FROM A RIGHT MOTIVE
TITUS WAS NOT CIRCUMCISED
WHO ARE YOU TO DISSENT FROM THE FATHERS AND THE ENTIRE CHURCH AND TO BRING A CONTRADICTORY DOCTRINE
THE APOSTLES ERRED IN THINKING OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST AS A WORLDLY STATE
BUT IF YE BE LED OF THE SPIRIT YE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW
I AM A SINNER AND DESERVE GOD'S WRATH AND PUNISHMENT AND YET THE FATHER LOVES ME
FIRST A PERSON MUST REALIZE THAT HE IS A SINNER THE KIND OF A SINNER WHO IS CONGENITALLY UNABLE TO DO ANY GOOD THING
THE APOSTLE WANTS HIS GALATIANS TO KNOW THAT JUST BECAUSE HE HAD TOLD THEM THE TRUTH THEY ARE NOT TO THINK THAT HE DISLIKES THEM
THEY GAVE ME THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP
IN II CORINTHIANS 5:21 PAUL WRITES
IT IS NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT PAUL URGES US TO WATCH AND TO STAND FAST
BUT IF WE ARE CARELESS AND INDIFFERENT WE SHALL LOSE THEM
PAUL'S VICTORY WAS COMPLETE
BUT LET NOT GOD SPEAK WITH US LEST WE DIE THE PROPER OFFICE OF THE LAW IS TO LEAD US OUT OF OUR TENTS IN OTHER WORDS OUT OF THE SECURITY OF OUR SELF-TRUST INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT WE MAY PERCEIVE HIS ANGER AT OUR SINFULNESS
HOPE IN GOD WHO HAS NOT SPARED HIS OWN DEAR SON BUT HAS GIVEN HIM INTO DEATH FOR THY SINS WHEN THE LAW CARRIES THINGS TOO FAR SAY
SEE THE HEAVENLY PHYSICIAN CHRIST WHO HEALS THE BROKEN-HEARTED
NOW TAKE CARE THAT YOU DO NOT USE YOUR WONDERFUL LIBERTY FOR AN OCCASION OF THE FLESH SATAN LIKES TO TURN THIS LIBERTY WHICH CHRIST HAS GOTTEN FOR US INTO LICENTIOUSNESS
BUT THERE IS NO GLORY IN IT FOR GOD BECAUSE BY THEIR EXERTIONS THESE WORKERS PRONOUNCE GOD AN UNMERCIFUL SLAVE DRIVER AN UNFAITHFUL AND ANGRY JUDGE
THEREFORE LAW SIN AND DEATH MAY NOT HURT YOU OR DRIVE YOU TO DESPAIR
WHY WAS CHRIST BORN ANYWAY
IF ANY MAY HE CRIES PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL UNTO YOU THAN THAT YE HAVE RECEIVED LET HIM BE ACCURSED LATER ON IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER HE THREATENS THE FALSE APOSTLES WITH DAMNATION
IT IS TERSELY SPOKEN
THEY ARE BOLD BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER GONE THROUGH ANY TRIALS OF FAITH
GOD NEVER PROMISED TO SAVE ANYBODY FOR HIS RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE OF CEREMONIES AND ORDINANCES
14:11 12 BUT THE HOLY GHOST WAS IN MOSES AND MADE INTERCESSION FOR HIM WITH UNUTTERABLE GROANINGS SIGHINGS UNTO THE LORD
BUT IT COULD NOT DO IT BECAUSE THE MERCY OF GOD IS EVERLASTING
YOU MAY PREACH THE LAW EVER SO FERVENTLY
MISTER LAW YOU HAVE LOST YOUR THRONE TO CHRIST
THESE THAT HAVE TURNED THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN ARE COME HITHER ALSO
WHOM THEN SHALL WE BELIEVE OUR OPPONENTS MAINTAIN THAT THEY TEACH THE PURE WORD OF GOD
BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME TO KNOW THE TRUE GOD WHY DO YOU GO BACK TO THE WORSHIP OF IDOLS PAUL SEEMS TO IDENTIFY THEIR DEFECTION FROM THE GOSPEL TO THE LAW WITH THEIR FORMER IDOLATRY
THIS IS TO SAY I CONFERRED NOT ONLY WITH THE BRETHREN BUT WITH THE LEADERS AMONG THEM VERSE 2
IT TAKES MORE THAN THAT TO MAKE US RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD
YOU MAY FREELY DISTRIBUTE COPY OR PRINT THIS TEXT
SUCH SCOFFING DISTRESSES US BUT WE CANNOT STOP IT
WITHOUT CHRIST THEY ARE ALL WRONG
WE ARE NOT ASHAMED OF THESE TITLES
THE JEWS WERE OFFENDED AT THE IDEA THAT THE LAW OF GOD SHOULD BE ENTIRELY IGNORED BY PAUL AND THAT THE GENTILES FORMER IDOL-WORSHIPPERS SHOULD GRATUITOUSLY ATTAIN TO THE STATION OF GOD'S PEOPLE WITHOUT CIRCUMCISION WITHOUT THE PENITENTIARY PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW BY GRACE ALONE THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
IN SUCH A CONTROVERSY PAUL DID NOT MIND IF ANYBODY TOOK OFFENSE
FOR IN CHRIST JESUS NEITHER CIRCUMCISION AVAILETH ANYTHING NOR UNCIRCUMCISION BUT A NEW CREATURE
YOU WANT TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW BY CIRCUMCISION AND BY WORKS
YOU HAVE GAINED LIBERTY THROUGH CHRIST I.E YOU ARE ABOVE ALL LAWS AS FAR AS CONSCIENCE IS CONCERNED
NOW IF THIS IS TRUE AND IT IS TRUE THEN ARE WE NEVER JUSTIFIED BY OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS
DON'T GO BY YOUR FEELINGS BUT GO BY THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH WHICH PLEDGES CHRIST TO YOU THE QUESTION OCCURS TO US WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN FAITH AND HOPE
BUT THE PEOPLE TREMBLED WITH FEAR FLED AND STANDING ALOOF THEY BEGGED MOSES
THEY ARE TURNING LAW INTO GRACE AND GRACE INTO LAW
AND SINS AGAINST THE SECOND TABLE DISHONOR OF PARENTS DISOBEDIENCE OF GOVERNMENT COVETING OF ANOTHER'S POSSESSIONS ETC
WE ARE BORN IN SIN
THEY ARE CHANGING MOSES INTO CHRIST AND CHRIST INTO MOSES
TO THE CORINTHIANS HE WROTE
HE WRITES
WE OUGHT TO HAVE NO MISGIVINGS ABOUT WHETHER THE HOLY GHOST DWELLS IN US
IF THEY HAD THEIR WAY THEY WOULD IGNORE ALL DIFFERENCES IN DOCTRINE AND PRESERVE UNITY AT ALL COST
THOUGH THE CONSCIENCE HURTS WHEN WE FAIL TO FULFILL THIS COMMANDMENT IN EVERY RESPECT WE ARE NOT OVERWHELMED BY OUR FAILURE TO BEAR OUR NEIGHBOR SINCERE AND BROTHERLY LOVE
I AM NOW ONE WITH CHRIST
IT IS THE PROPERTY OF GOOD LIVES TO BE AFRAID OF A FAULT WHERE THERE IS NO FAULT OUR CENSORS MUST BE FEARED EVEN IF THEY ARE UNJUST AND WRONG ON THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS THE PAPISTS BASE THEIR DOCTRINE OF EXCOMMUNICATION
AS IF HE MEANT TO SAY WHAT IS MORE HUMAN THAN FOR A HUMAN BEING TO FALL TO BE DECEIVED AND TO ERR THIS COMFORTING SENTENCE AT ONE TIME SAVED MY LIFE
PAUL CALLS THE FALSE APOSTLES TROUBLERS OF THE CHURCH BECAUSE THEY TAUGHT CIRCUMCISION AND THE KEEPING OF THE LAW AS NEEDFUL UNTO SALVATION
WHAT WAS THE USE OF OUR HAVING LIVED IN A CLOISTER TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS
AND GOD HATH SET SOME IN THE CHURCH
HE KNOWS HOW TO ENLARGE THE SMALLEST SIN INTO A MOUNTAIN UNTIL WE THINK WE HAVE COMMITTED THE WORST CRIME EVER COMMITTED ON EARTH
ANY UNCONVERTED PERSON WHO SAYS HE LOVES THE LAW IS A LIAR
LAW AND GRACE MAY BE MILES APART IN ESSENCE BUT IN THE HEART THEY ARE PRETTY CLOSE TOGETHER
THE HEATHEN OBSERVE THE SAME RESTRAINTS TO AVOID PUNISHMENT OR TO SECURE THE ADVANTAGES OF A GOOD REPUTATION
SINCE THE WRATH OF GOD HAS BEEN ASSUAGED BY CHRIST NO LAW SIN OR DEATH MAY NOW ACCUSE AND CONDEMN US
AND HE COUNTED IT TO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS PAUL PLACES THE EMPHASIS UPON THE TWO WORDS
AS LONG AS A PERSON THINKS HE IS RIGHT HE IS GOING TO BE INCOMPREHENSIBLY PROUD AND PRESUMPTUOUS
THE LAW IS NOT TO HAVE ITS SAY INDEFINITELY
IF YOU ASK HOW GOD MAY BE FOUND WHO JUSTIFIES SINNERS KNOW THAT THERE IS NO OTHER GOD BESIDES THIS MAN CHRIST JESUS
I TOLD MYSELF
THE APOSTLE DRAWS INTO HIS ARGUMENT THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHET HABAKKUK
WHAT EVER INDUCED GOD TO ADOPT US FOR HIS CHILDREN AND HEIRS
GOD MAY POSTPONE HIS PUNISHMENT FOR A TIME BUT HE WILL FIND YOU OUT IN TIME AND PUNISH YOU FOR DESPISING HIS SERVANTS
MEN KNOW INSTINCTIVELY THAT THERE IS A GOD
THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM WITH ITS ORDINANCES AND LAWS REPRESENTS HAGAR AND HER OFFSPRING
IF THE LAW ITSELF CANNOT JUSTIFY MUCH LESS CAN IMPERFECT PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW OR THE WORKS OF THE LAW JUSTIFY
I MUST SAY I DO NOT FIND MUCH PLEASURE IN EXPLAINING THESE VERSES
THEY TAKE MORE PAINS TO EARN HELL THAN THE MARTYRS OF CHRIST TO OBTAIN HEAVEN
TELL HIM THAT HIS DEFINITION OF CHRIST IS WRONG THAT CHRIST HAS GIVEN HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS THAT BY HIS SACRIFICE HE HAS TAKEN AWAY THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD
NOT FOR ONE OR TWO BUT FOR ALL
IF PETER FELL I MAY FALL
YOU HAVE NEVER BECOME INFECTED WITH THE NEFARIOUS ERRORS ON WHICH I SUCKLED ALL MY YOUTH UNTIL AT THE MENTION OF THE NAME OF CHRIST I SHIVERED WITH FEAR
PETER VISITING SOME OF THESE GENTILES ATE MEAT AND DRANK WINE WITH THEM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW THAT THESE THINGS WERE FORBIDDEN IN THE LAW
THE CONFERENCE AGREED THAT THE JEWS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO KEEP THEIR ANCIENT CUSTOMS FOR THE TIME BEING SO LONG AS THEY DID NOT REGARD THOSE CUSTOMS AS CONVEYING GOD'S JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER
WE INVITE OUR OPPONENTS TO TELL US WHAT GOOD THINGS ATTENDED THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BY THE APOSTLES
THERE IS NO UNITY OF SPIRIT NO AGREEMENT OF MINDS BUT GREAT DISSENSION IN THE PAPACY
IS IT NOT AMAZING THAT A PERSON SHOULD REFUSE TO HEAR THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR HIM
THEY AT LEAST DO NOT TRY TO JUSTIFY THEIR WICKED DEEDS
NEITHER ARE WORKS INJURIOUS PROVIDED A PERSON DOES NOT ATTACH ANY SAVING VALUE TO THEM
PAUL CALLS THIS PRESENT WORLD EVIL BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN IT IS SUBJECT TO THE MALICE OF THE DEVIL WHO REIGNS OVER THE WHOLE WORLD AS HIS DOMAIN AND FILLS THE AIR WITH IGNORANCE CONTEMPT HATRED AND DISOBEDIENCE OF GOD
THAT ALL NATIONS ARE TO BE BLESSED MEANS THAT ALL NATIONS ARE TO HEAR THE GOSPEL
WHEN PAUL SPEAKS OF THE INFIRMITY OF HIS FLESH HE DOES NOT MEAN SOME PHYSICAL DEFECT OR CARNAL LUST BUT THE SUFFERINGS AND AFFLICTIONS WHICH HE ENDURED IN HIS BODY
BUT NOW BY ABSTAINING FROM MEATS FORBIDDEN IN THE LAW HE WENT AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT
THE LAW ALARMS US IT MAGNIFIES OUR SINS UNTIL WE BEGIN TO HATE THE LAW AND ITS DIVINE AUTHOR
SOLOMON IN THIS PASSAGE DOES NOT SPEAK OF THE LOVE AND HATRED OF GOD BUT OF LOVE AND HATRED AMONG MEN
THAT IS THE MOST YOU SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO DO
I WAS GREATLY AFFLICTED PS
THESE PRODUCTS OF THE SPIRIT YOU ENJOYED BEFORE THE FALSE APOSTLES MISLED YOU THE APOSTLE REMINDS THE GALATIANS
NOW THERE IS NO OTHER FOUNDATION THAN JESUS CHRIST
HAGAR LIVES THERE IN THE HOME OF THE LAW THE TEMPLE THE PRIESTHOOD THE CEREMONIES AND WHATEVER ELSE WAS ORDAINED IN THE LAW AT MOUNT SINAI
REMEMBER YOUR SINS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UPON CHRIST IN THIS WAY ARE WE DELIVERED FROM SIN
FAITH IS WEAK BUT IT MEANS ENOUGH TO GOD THAT HE WILL NOT LAY SIN TO OUR CHARGE
FAITHFUL PASTORS RECOGNIZE MANY ERRORS AND OFFENSES IN THE CHURCH WHICH THEY OVERSEE
THAT HE WAS JUSTIFIED BEFORE GOD WAS NOT DUE TO HIS OWN EXERTIONS BUT DUE TO HIS FAITH
THEY MAY EVEN TEACH THAT MEN ARE DELIVERED FROM THEIR SINS BY THE DEATH OF CHRIST
THE SAME LOVE HE FELT FOR THEM HE FEELS FOR US
BUT CHRIST LIVETH IN ME
AS FOR ME I GLORY IN THE CROSS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST HE EXPRESSES THE SAME SENTIMENT IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS WHERE HE SAYS
EATING AND DRINKING SUCH THINGS AS THEY GIVE
THIS IS CIVIL LIBERTY
THAT WE SHOULD GO UNTO THE HEATHEN AND THEY UNTO THE CIRCUMCISION
IF IT IS A QUESTION OF WORKS THEN LIFT HIGH THE LANTERN OF WORKS AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW
THESE ARE MUNDANE MATTERS WHICH CANNOT SAVE THE SINNER
BUT I GIVE MYSELF UNTO PRAYER PS
AND DID NOT CHRIST PERFORM MANY GOOD DEEDS AND SUFFER MANY EVILS PATIENTLY BIDDING US TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE
WHEN A BELIEVER ACCEPTS THE HEAVENLY GIFTS OF THE GOSPEL HE IS IN HEAVEN
HENCE THE GOSPEL IS SUPERIOR TO THE LAW AS THE WORD OF A LORD IS SUPERIOR TO THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT
WHAT IS THERE IN ANYBODY TO PRAISE
THEY TESTIFIED
FAITH IS TRULY THE HEIGHT OF WISDOM THE RIGHT KIND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THE ONLY REAL RELIGION
PAUL I SUPPOSE IS ALLUDING TO THE RITE OF CIRCUMCISION
I KNOW YOUR DEFECTION WAS NOT WILLFUL
THEY WERE OFFENDED AT THE LAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND ITS PURPOSE
THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY
HERETICS DO NOT ADVERTISE THEIR ERRORS
THIS IS REAL LIBERTY COMPARED WITH WHICH EVERY OTHER KIND OF LIBERTY IS NOT WORTH MENTIONING
UNDER THE PAPACY WE WERE TOLD TO TOIL UNTIL THE FEELING OF GUILT HAD LEFT US
UNABLE TO PREVAIL BY FORCE HE ENGAGES WICKED AND UNGODLY TEACHERS WHO AT FIRST MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH US THEN CLAIM THAT THEY ARE PARTICULARLY CALLED TO TEACH THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF THE SCRIPTURES TO SUPERIMPOSE UPON THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT WE TEACH
THAT HE IS FAITHFUL AND TRUE AND THAT HE KEEPS HIS PROMISES
I ALSO AM LORD OVER THE LAW BECAUSE BY FAITH I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
PAUL COULD NOT LET THIS ASSERTION STAND FOR WITHOUT FAITH ALL THINGS ARE DEADLY
THEY WOULD GLADLY EMBRACE THE WORD WITH A FULL FAITH BUT THE FLESH DETERS THEM
GRACE REMITS SIN AND PEACE QUIETS THE CONSCIENCE
WHAT DID HE DO ABOUT IT
THAT YE WILL BE NONE OTHERWISE MINDED
WHY ART THOU CAST DOWN O MY SOUL
THIS ARGUMENT IS NOT ALWAYS TO OUR ADVANTAGE
ST LUKE FURNISHES AN ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT IN THE NINTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF ACTS
I HAVE HE SAYS AT ONE TIME DEFENDED THE TRADITIONS OF THE PHARISEES MORE FIERCELY THAN ANY OF YOUR FALSE APOSTLES
OUR QUARREL IS NOT WITH THOSE WHO LIVE IN MANIFEST SINS
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE FOREVER
WHEN YOU SAY THAT A PERSON CAN DO NOTHING TO OBTAIN THE GRACE OF GOD YOU FOSTER CARNAL SECURITY
CRYING ABBA FATHER
ON THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION WE MUST REMAIN ADAMANT OR ELSE WE SHALL LOSE THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
BEHOLD FOR PEACE I HAD GREAT BITTERNESS PAUL LOOKS WITH SUSPICION UPON ANY DOCTRINE THAT DOES NOT PROVOKE ANTAGONISM
WALK IN THE SPIRIT AND YE SHALL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH WITH THIS VERSE PAUL EXPLAINS HOW HE WANTS THIS SENTENCE TO BE UNDERSTOOD
BUT THEY HATE MY DOCTRINE AND WANT TO STAMP IT OUT
HOW CAN THE LAW EFFECT OUR JUSTIFICATION WHEN PAUL SO PLAINLY STATES THAT WE MUST BE DEAD TO THE LAW IF WE WANT TO LIVE UNTO GOD
JOHN THE BAPTIST CONFESSED CHRIST
RIGHTEOUSNESS IS IMMORTAL AND INVINCIBLE
BEHOLD I PAUL SAY UNTO YOU THAT IF YE BE CIRCUMCISED CHRIST SHALL PROFIT YOU NOTHING
THE WORLD MAY JUDGE CERTAIN THINGS TO BE EVER SO GOOD
GOD FORBID THAT THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS SHOULD EVER BE REMOVED
FOR ABRAHAM HAD TWO KINDS OF CHILDREN CHILDREN BORN OF THE PROMISE LIKE ISAAC AND OTHER CHILDREN BORN WITHOUT THE PROMISE AS ISHMAEL
FOR WHATEVER A MAN SOWETH THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP
SOMETIMES HE SPEAKS OF FAITH INDEPENDENTLY OF OTHER MATTERS
IT PUTS THE FEAR OF GOD IN A MAN
TO THE PHILIPPIANS HE WROTE
AND NOT ONLY TO ABRAHAM BUT TO ALL BELIEVERS BECAUSE GOD SAID
ON ONE OCCASION HE SAID TO THE JEWS
ALL I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE THE SPIRIT FOR YOUR GUIDE AND RESIST THE FLESH
HE CALLS THEM TROUBLEMAKERS SEDUCERS OF POOR CONSCIENCES
ALL THINGS DIFFER
O WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM
O WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM
A PERSON WHO JOINS THIS OR THAT HOLY ORDER HAS THE PROMISE OF EVERLASTING LIFE TO ME IT IS A MIRACLE THAT THE CHURCH SO LONG SURROUNDED BY VICIOUS SECTS HAS BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE AT ALL
VERSE 21

THAT IS HOW GOOD A MEDIATOR MOSES WAS
THESE PERIODS OF THE LAW WILL COME AGAIN AND AGAIN AS LONG AS WE LIVE
YOU ARE SO TAKEN UP BY YOUR SUPERSTITIONS AND CEREMONIES THAT SERVE NO GOOD PURPOSE THAT YOU NEGLECT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING LOVE ST JEROME SAYS
HE BEDEVILS THE MINDS OF MEN WITH HIDEOUS FALLACIES
BUT HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT IN THE SON SHALL NOT SEE LIFE BUT THE WRATH OF GOD ABIDETH IN HIM THE WORDS YE ARE FALLEN FROM GRACE MUST NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
HE SAYS TO THEM
WHETHER A WOMAN IS CHASTE OBEDIENT TO HER HUSBAND AND A GOOD MOTHER
THEY COULD NOT LISTEN TO THEIR MEDIATOR MOSES WITHOUT ANOTHER MEDIATOR THE VEIL
BY RECEIVING AND MAINTAINING PAUL THEY CALLED UPON THEIR OWN HEADS THE HATRED AND MALICE OF ALL THE JEWS AND GENTILES
LIKE PAUL WE ALSO DO ALL THESE THINGS FOR THE SAKE OF GOD'S ELECT
THOSE WHO ARE JUSTIFIED ARE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST
LET US PRAISE AND THANK GOD FOR HIS MERCY IN DELIVERING US FROM THE CAPTIVITY OF SATAN WHEN WE WERE UNABLE TO DO SO BY OUR OWN STRENGTH
THEY ARE THE KIND THAT WOULD SCOFF LAW OR NO LAW
HE DID SO WITHOUT HESITATION
GOD MUST THEREFORE FIRST TAKE THE SLEDGE-HAMMER OF THE LAW IN HIS FISTS AND SMASH THE BEAST OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ITS BROOD OF SELF-CONFIDENCE SELF-WISDOM SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SELF-HELP
ON TOP OF THAT TO REFUSE THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE REMISSION OF SINS OFFERED UNTO US BY CHRIST IS THE WORST SIN OF ALL THE SIN OF SINS
COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST VERSE 19
NOBODY WANTS TO FULFILL HIS DUTIES
BETTER NOT PREACH THIS DOCTRINE OF FAITH
SATAN THE MORE YOU HURT ME THE MORE I OPPOSE YOU VERSE 15
THE APOSTLE CALLS IT AN EARNEST BESEECHING
THEREFORE WE MUST ALWAYS BELIEVE AND ALWAYS HOPE IN CHRIST
WHAT UNITY OF FAITH CAN EXIST AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT MONKS AND THE DIFFERENT ORDERS
DOES NOT HOLY WRIT FORBID US TO TRUST IN MEN
WHEN A FATHER CORRECTS HIS SON IT MEANS AS IF HE WERE SAYING MY SON I BESEECH YOU BE A GOOD BOY VERSE 12
THE PASSION OF LUST WRATH AND OTHER VICES MAY SHAKE HIM BUT THEY ARE NOT TO GET HIM DOWN
IT WAS A SIDELINE WITH HIM
JOY JOY MEANS SWEET THOUGHTS OF CHRIST MELODIOUS HYMNS AND PSALMS PRAISES AND THANKSGIVING WITH WHICH CHRISTIANS INSTRUCT INSPIRE AND REFRESH THEMSELVES
AND WOULD PERVERT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST
THE TREE COMES FIRST AND THEN COME THE FRUITS
IT CAN ONLY REMIND US OF THE OLD BIRTH BY WHICH WE WERE BORN INTO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEVIL
PAUL HERE EXPLAINS HIS MOTIVE FOR GOING UP TO JERUSALEM
BEFORE THE JUDGMENT THRONE OF CHRIST EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO BEAR HIS OWN BURDEN
ON EVERY PAGE THE SCRIPTURES URGE US TO BELIEVE THAT GOD IS MERCIFUL LOVING AND PATIENT
OUR OPPONENTS CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS
BUT BECAUSE CHRIST TOOK THE PLACE OF OTHERS WHO WERE SINNERS HE WAS HANGED LIKE ANY OTHER TRANSGRESSOR
HE COULD NOT SUPPLY THE ABILITY TO PERFORM THE LAW
UNBELIEVERS HAVE ALWAYS PREDICTED THE DEATH OF THE CHURCH
GAIN ASSURANCE THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD
NEITHER DO I DEMAND THAT YOU SHOULD GET RID OF THE FLESH BUT THAT YOU SHOULD CONTROL AND SUBDUE IT VERSE 17
BUT ALL THIS DOES NOT MAKE US RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD PETER AND THE OTHERS LIVED UP TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW
NEVERTHELESS CHRIST WILL REIGN TO THE END OF THE WORLD AND THAT MIRACULOUSLY AS HE DID DURING THE DARK AGES
LET CHRIST BE IN IT AND NOT THE LAW
BUT IF HE COULD BE WITH THEM IN PERSON HE COULD CHANGE HIS VOICE AS THE OCCASION DEMANDED
NOBODY EVER HEARD OF THE HOLY GHOST BEING GIVEN TO ANYBODY BE HE DOCTOR OR DUNCE AS A RESULT OF THE PREACHING OF THE LAW
THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITH THIS PASSAGE CARRIES MUCH WEIGHT BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES THE LAW AND THE DEEDS OF THE LAW AS FACTORS IN THE PROCESS OF OUR JUSTIFICATION
THE SERVANT IS NOT GREATER THAN HIS LORD
ALL I CAN DO NOW IS TO PRAY THAT OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WOULD BLESS MY EPISTLE AND GRANT YOU THE GUIDANCE OF THE HOLY GHOST THE LORD JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR WHO GAVE ME THE STRENGTH AND THE GRACE TO EXPLAIN THIS EPISTLE AND GRANTED YOU THE GRACE TO HEAR IT PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN US IN FAITH UNTO THE DAY OF OUR REDEMPTION
HE REPORTED THIS TO THE DISCIPLES AT ANTIOCH
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR MOTHER I WILL TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN SHE IS
HOPE LOOKS TO THE GOODNESS OF GOD
PAUL GOES ON IN HIS REFUTATION OF THE FALSE APOSTLES BY SAYING THAT IN ANTIOCH HE WITHSTOOD PETER IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION
AGAIN THE APOSTLE TAKES THE AUTHORS OF SECTS TO TASK FOR BEING HARD-HEARTED TYRANTS
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT EVER HOPE TO OBTAIN FORGIVENESS BY THEIR SINS
DID NOT THE WHOLE WORLD SEETHE WITH UNREST AS THE GOSPEL WAS PREACHED IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO REASON
YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL WE ARE NOT LIKE THESE JEWS THE CHILDREN OF THE BONDWOMAN THE LAW WHO WERE CAST OUT OF THE HOUSE BY JESUS
ANANIAS RECOGNIZED HIS LIMITED ASSIGNMENT WHEN HE SAID TO PAUL
WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT IN OUR HEARTS CRYING ABBA FATHER THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT GOD HAS ADOPTED US FOR HIS CHILDREN AND THAT OUR SUBJECTION TO THE LAW HAS COME TO AN END WE ARE NOW THE FREE CHILDREN OF GOD
IS NOT THIS HORRIBLE BLASPHEMY

AND BE NOT ENTANGLED AGAIN WITH THE YOKE OF BONDAGE
THE APOSTLE TURNS THE FOREGOING SENTENCE AROUND
IF YOU STICK TO THE LAW CHRIST IS OF NO USE TO YOU
BY THE FAVOR OF GOD I A WICKED AND CURSED WRETCH A BLASPHEMER PERSECUTOR AND REBEL WAS SPARED
GOD IS ANGRY AT YOU AND IS GOING TO DESTROY YOU FOREVER IN ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE ONLY ONE SUPPORT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST
HENCE THIS COMMANDMENT INSTEAD OF JUSTIFYING MEN ONLY ACCUSES AND CONDEMNS THEM
THE APOSTLE ALWAYS HAS CHRIST ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE
BUT IS UNDER TUTORS AND GOVERNORS UNTIL THE TIME APPOINTED OF THE FATHER
IF CHRIST DID NOT PUNISH THEM WHAT RIGHT HAVE WE TO DO IT
HE IS CALLED MY LAW AGAINST THE LAW MY SIN AGAINST SIN MY DEATH AGAINST DEATH
THAT ABRAHAM SUBMITTED TO CIRCUMCISION AT THE COMMAND OF GOD THAT HE WAS ENDOWED WITH EXCELLENT VIRTUES THAT HE OBEYED GOD IN ALL THINGS WAS CERTAINLY ADMIRABLE OF HIM
IF THE LAW DOES NO MORE THAN TO REVEAL SIN DOES IT NOT OPPOSE THE PROMISES OF GOD
ALREADY THE APOSTLE JUDE COMPLAINED IN HIS DAY
THE LAW HAD NO CHANCE TO BUTT IN BECAUSE MOSES WAS NOT YET BORN
PAUL MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN GOD SENT FORTH THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON INTO YOUR HEARTS CALLING ABBA FATHER INSTEAD HE WROTE CRYING ABBA FATHER IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS THE APOSTLE DESCRIBES THIS CRYING OF THE SPIRIT AS GROANINGS WHICH CANNOT BE UTTERED HE WRITES IN THE 26TH VERSE
IN ATTRIBUTING THESE ACHIEVEMENTS TO CHRIST THE SCRIPTURES PRONOUNCE CHRIST TO BE GOD FOREVER
IS THEREFORE CHRIST THE MINISTER OF SIN
CHRIST WOULD BE OF NO BENEFIT TO ME
IT SEEMS WE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE POPE
I THINK HE SAYS THAT GOD HATH SET FORTH US THE APOSTLES LAST AS IT WERE APPOINTED TO DEATH
ARE YOU WISER THAN SO MANY HOLY MEN WISER THAN THE WHOLE CHURCH WHEN SATAN ABETTED BY OUR OWN REASON ADVANCES THESE ARGUMENTS AGAINST US WE LOSE HEART UNLESS WE KEEP ON SAYING TO OURSELVES
AS A GENTILE HE DID NOT OBSERVE THE LAW
IT WAS THEN THAT FAITH AND THE OBJECT OF FAITH WERE FULLY REVEALED
PAUL'S ADMONITION THAT THE HEARERS OF THE GOSPEL SHARE ALL GOOD THINGS WITH THEIR PASTORS AND TEACHERS IS CERTAINLY IN ORDER
THE LAW REQUIRES PERFECT OBEDIENCE
I WILL DO THIS I WILL DO THAT MAN IF YOU DON'T DO THE VERY OPPOSITE IF YOU DON'T SEND MOSES WITH THE LAW BACK TO MOUNT SINAI AND TAKE THE HAND OF CHRIST PIERCED FOR YOUR SINS YOU WILL NEVER BE SAVED
BUT THIS STATEMENT EXPRESSES MORE THAN GRIEF
AND CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND BLESSING FROM CHRIST TO OURSELVES
BEING PERSECUTED WE SUFFER IT
WHAT HAS GOT INTO YOU PAUL REPROVES THE GALATIANS RATHER SHARPLY WHEN HE CALLS THEM FOOLS BEWITCHED AND DISOBEDIENT WHETHER HE IS INDIGNANT OR SORRY I CANNOT SAY
IF THERE IS ANY HONESTY LEFT IN THEM THEY WILL HAVE TO CONFESS THAT THEIR FREEDOM DATES FROM THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
THUS PETER CURSED SIMON THE SORCERER THY MONEY PERISH WITH THEE MANY INSTANCES OF THIS HOLY CURSING ARE RECORDED IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURES ESPECIALLY IN THE PSALMS E.G LET DEATH SEIZE UPON THEM AND LET THEM GO DOWN QUICK INTO HELL PS
I LED YOU OUT OF BONDAGE INTO THE FREEDOM OF THE SONS OF GOD NOT BY THE PRESCRIPTION OF LAWS BUT BY THE GIFT OF HEAVENLY AND ETERNAL BLESSINGS THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
THE BEST THE LAW CAN DO FOR US IS TO PREPARE US FOR A NEW BIRTH THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
EITHER THE LAW MUST BE COVERED WITH A VEIL AND THEN IT LOSES ITS FULL EFFECTIVENESS OR IT MUST BE UNVEILED AND THEN THE FULL BLAST OF ITS FORCE KILLS
AND YOU ARE SLAVES
BECAUSE I REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE CIRCUMCISION AS A FACTOR IN OUR SALVATION I HAVE BROUGHT UPON MYSELF THE HATRED AND PERSECUTION OF MY WHOLE NATION
THE SCHOLASTICS EXPLAIN THE WAY OF SALVATION IN THIS MANNER
FIRST THEY MAY BE REFUSED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRISTIAN LOVE
I LIVE HE SAYS I LIVE NOT
BEFORE GOD THEY COUNT FOR NOTHING
INDEED WORKS DO FOLLOW AFTER FAITH BUT FAITH IS NOT THEREFORE A MERITORIOUS WORK
THEY SAY
BUT THIS HARD SENTENCE IS DIRECTED CHIEFLY AT THE HERETICS WHO ARE LARGE WITH THEIR OWN SELF-IMPORTANCE THAT THEY MAY BE FRIGHTENED INTO TAKING UP THE FIGHT OF THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH
IT SOLILOQUIZES
RATHER ACCORDING TO THE FLESH
WITH EVERY SINGLE WORD THE APOSTLE SEEKS TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE GALATIANS
IN CALLING THE LAW THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD PAUL MEANS TO SAY THAT THE LAW IS SOMETHING MATERIAL MUNDANE EARTHLY
THE ARGUMENTS WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES ADVANCED IMPRESS PEOPLE TO THIS DAY
I MAY FALL TODAY PAUL THEREFORE WARNS THE PASTORS NOT TO BE TOO RIGOROUS AND UNMERCIFUL TOWARDS OFFENDERS BUT TO SHOW THEM EVERY AFFECTION ALWAYS REMEMBERING
THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON ALL OF THEM WHICH HEARD THE WORD THESE ARE ACTUAL EXPERIENCES THAT CANNOT VERY WELL BE DENIED
I FEAR THIS EPISTLE RECALLED VERY FEW FROM THEIR ERROR
HE PRAYED
THIS IS THE NATURAL RELIGION OF THE WORLD
THEN TOO WE SOMETIMES DRIVE AWAY THE HOLY SPIRIT
FOR A TWOFOLD PURPOSE
I HONORED THE POPE AS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE
HIS ANTAGONISM TO THE LAW IS A PERSONAL MATTER WITH HIM
AGAIN THE APOSTLE PUTS IN A GENTLE WORD
LET NOBODY THINK THAT HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THIS COMMANDMENT THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF IT SOUNDS SHORT AND EASY BUT SHOW ME THE MAN WHO CAN TEACH LEARN AND DO THIS COMMANDMENT PERFECTLY
HE FORGOT THAT HE WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH HIS CRIME SO THAT HE SHOULD HURRY TO GOD FOR MERCY AND FOR PARDON
WE ARE NOT THE MASTERS JUDGES OR ARBITERS BUT WITNESSES DISCIPLES AND CONFESSORS OF THE SCRIPTURES WHETHER WE BE POPE LUTHER AUGUSTINE PAUL OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN
IF YOU CARE TO AMPLIFY THIS MATTER YOU MAY ADD THE OBSERVATION THAT THE LAW IS A WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENT BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE WEAK AND BEGGARLY
DID HE KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF PRISON
IT WAS ALL DONE TO NO PURPOSE IF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS TO BE HAD BY THE LAW
NOTE ESPECIALLY THE PRONOUN OUR AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE
CHRISTIANS MUST HAVE STRONG SHOULDERS TO BEAR THE BURDENS OF THEIR FELLOW CHRISTIANS
KNOWING THAT A MAN IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW BUT BY THE FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST
WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK HIM
CONSIDERING THYSELF LEST THOU ALSO BE TEMPTED
BE AS I AM
BE AS I AM
A FATHER PUNISHES HIS SON BECAUSE HE LOVES HIS SON
ABRAHAM MASTERED REASON BY FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD
WHEN THE LAW TAKES US INTO JUDGMENT IT HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO SO
SOMETHING OCCURRED TO HIM AND HE THROWS IT IN BY THE WAY
CHAPTER 6 VERSE 1
NOW A MEDIATOR IS NOT A MEDIATOR OF ONE
WE HAVE CHRIST TO THANK FOR EVERYTHING
THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH IF IT IS A WORKING FAITH OR A FAITH FORMED AND PERFORMED BY CHARITABLE WORKS THEIR ANNOTATION IS A FORGERY
PAUL IS NOW GETTING READY FOR THE SECOND ARGUMENT OF HIS EPISTLE TO THE EFFECT THAT TO SEEK JUSTIFICATION BY WORKS OF THE LAW IS TO REJECT THE GRACE OF GOD
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE GENTILES HAD RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST WITHOUT LAW AND CIRCUMCISION BY THE SIMPLE PREACHING OF FAITH
JUDAS ACTED LIKE THE OTHER DISCIPLES
IN THIS WAY THEY TROUBLED THE GALATIANS AND CAUSED QUARRELS AMONG THEM UNTIL THEY PROVOKED AND ENVIED EACH OTHER
YOU ARE PUT OUT OF THE HOUSE THIS IS THE SENTENCE WHICH GOD PRONOUNCES UPON THE ISHMAELITES THE PAPISTS AND ALL OTHERS WHO TRUST IN THEIR OWN MERITS AND PERSECUTE THE CHURCH OF CHRIST
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT OR TAKE DEATH
SON THY SINS ARE FORGIVEN THEE
BUT I WENT INTO ARABIA AND RETURNED AGAIN UNTO DAMASCUS
BUT I WENT INTO ARABIA AND RETURNED AGAIN UNTO DAMASCUS
THE NEED FOR RESTRAINT SHOWS PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THOSE WHO NEED THE LAW ARE NOT RIGHTEOUS BUT WICKED MEN WHO ARE FIT TO BE TIED
IF YOU KNOW CHRIST AT ALL YOU KNOW THAT GOOD WORKS DO NOT SERVE UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS NOR EVIL WORKS UNTO CONDEMNATION
AND ALTHOUGH WE DAILY OFFEND GOD BY OUR SINS YET AS OFTEN AS WE SIN GOD'S MERCY BENDS OVER US
THEY CANNOT PROCURE FOR ME EVERLASTING LIFE
HENCE CHRIST'S LIBERTY IS GIVEN US NOT BY THE LAW OR FOR OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT FREELY FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
THESE PASSAGES ARE ALL MEANT TO BENEFIT US MINISTERS
LET ME ILLUSTRATE
UNTO HIM YE SHALL HEARKEN DEUT
GOD LIKES CHEERFUL HEARTS
CHRIST IS THE END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVETH ROMANS 10:1 HOW MAY THESE TWO CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS OF THE APOSTLE YE KNEW NOT GOD AND YE WORSHIPPED GOD BE RECONCILED
NOW THESE TEACHERS WHO CAME AFTER YOU HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING SO BEAUTIFULLY THIS EXPLANATION THE APOSTLE REFUSES TO ACCEPT
TO MAKE SURE HE INTRODUCES ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION
HE ADDRESSES THEM AS GALATIANS IN ORDER TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR NATIONAL TRAIT TO BE FOOLISH
BUT IF YOU ABANDON THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SPIRIT FOR THAT OF THE FLESH YOU ARE GOING TO FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH AND DIE IN YOUR SINS VERSE 17
AS LONG AS WE ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT AND ARE WILLING TO OBEY THE SPIRIT WHO RESISTS THE FLESH WE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW
WE KNOW THIS
WHAT BUSINESS HAVE THEY TO MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT WORKS OR MERITS
THIS PROMISE HE BELIEVED AND THAT WAS COUNTED UNTO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
IT BELONGS TO CHRIST
NEW AFFECTIONS TOWARD GOD SPRING UP IN THE HEART
HE SAYS OF THEM WHICH SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE APOSTLES WAS INDEED GREAT IN ALL THE CHURCHES
OUR OPPONENTS REGARD FAITH AS AN EASY THING BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW HARD IT IS TO BELIEVE
WHAT HE HAS PROMISED HE WILL PERFORM
THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOSPEL THE DOCTRINE OF THE REVELATION OF THE SON OF GOD
THEY NEVER GAVE IT ANY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A CONDITION ATTACHED TO THE LAW WHICH READS
IN THE CONSCIENCE
BUT WE DARE NOT ABUSE THE PATIENCE OF THE LORD
HE THEREFORE THAT MINISTERETH TO YOU THE SPIRIT AND WORKETH MIRACLES AMONG YOU DOETH HE IT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW OR BY THE HEARING OF FAITH
IT MUST BE DIVINE
BUT THEY HAD HEARD ONLY THAT HE WHICH PERSECUTED US IN TIMES PAST NOW PREACHETH THE FAITH WHICH ONCE HE DESTROYED
THIS JESUS COULD NOT DO UNLESS HE WERE GOD
FOR GREAT IS YOUR REWARD IN HEAVEN THE CHURCH MUST NOT COME SHORT OF THIS JOY
ASK DAVID WHO OFTEN COMPLAINS IN THE PSALMS THAT HE WAS CAST AWAY FROM GOD AND IN HELL THAT HE WAS FRANTIC ABOUT HIS SIN AND SICK AT THE THOUGHT OF THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL
AND THE OTHER JEWS DISSEMBLED LIKEWISE WITH HIM
UNLESS GOD IS MERCIFUL TO ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE AND GRANTS UNTO ME A BLESSED DEPARTURE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO STAND BEFORE HIM HIS WAS A GOD-PLEASING DESPAIR
THIS MAN FELL INTO SIN
HE SAID TO THE PROPHET ELISHA
IF WE LIVE IN THE SPIRIT WHERE THE SPIRIT IS MEN GAIN NEW ATTITUDES
TRUE ENOUGH CHRIST ALSO TAUGHT AND EXPOUNDED THE LAW
THE WORDS YE DID RUN WELL ARE ENCOURAGING INDEED
SAY WITH CHRIST
THEREFORE I TAKE PLEASURE IN INFIRMITIES IN REPROACHES IN NECESSITIES IN PERSECUTIONS IN DISTRESSES FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
A CHRISTIAN IS FREE
BUT ALL THEIR PRAISE IS MERE PALAVER TO DECEIVE MEN
I CANNOT SAY IT OFTEN ENOUGH THAT WE MUST CAREFULLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DOCTRINE AND LIFE
THIS TYRANT POUNCES ON CHRIST
IF IT BE YET IN VAIN
IF IT BE YET IN VAIN
SOME WOULD LIKE TO SUBJUGATE US TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MOSAIC LAW
AND GOD WROUGHT SPECIAL MIRACLES BY THE HANDS OF PAUL SO THAT FROM HIS BODY WERE BROUGHT UNTO THE SICK HANDKERCHIEFS OR APRONS AND THE DISEASES DEPARTED FROM THEM AND THE EVIL SPIRITS WENT OUT OF THEM ACTS 19:11 12 TO CONCLUDE PAUL IS NOT GOING TO BE INFERIOR TO THE REST OF THE APOSTLES
MOST GLADLY THEREFORE WILL I RATHER GLORY IN MY INFIRMITIES THAT THE POWER OF CHRIST MAY REST UPON ME
IF PAUL HAD HAD TO DEPEND ON THIS KIND OF GLORY FOR HIS MINISTRY HE WOULD HAVE DESPAIRED WHEN HE SAW THE MANY OFFENSES AND EVILS FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF HIS PREACHING
HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT US WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE WHAT HE WILL DO FOR US OR HOW HE WILL SAVE US THAT MEN CANNOT KNOW INSTINCTIVELY
SMITH WALTHER LIBRARY CONCORDIA THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS BY MARTIN LUTHER
PAUL ONCE MORE SCORES THE FALSE APOSTLES IN AN EFFORT TO DRAW THE GALATIANS AWAY FROM THEIR FALSE DOCTRINE
BROTHER GET THINGS STRAIGHT
MOSES HIMSELF CONFESSED THAT HE WAS NOT A PERFECT DOER OF THE LAW
6:3 WHEN PEOPLE PRAISE OUR MINISTRY THEY ARE NOT PRAISING OUR PERSONS BUT GOD
HIS SINS AND HIS DEATH ARE MINE BECAUSE HE IS JOINED TO ME AND I TO HIM WHENEVER REMISSION OF SINS IS FREELY PROCLAIMED PEOPLE MISINTERPRET IT ACCORDING TO ROMANS 3:8 LET US DO EVIL THAT GOOD MAY COME AS SOON AS PEOPLE HEAR THAT WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW THEY REASON MALICIOUSLY
IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF THE BIBLE THAT WE ARE NOT TO INQUIRE CURIOUSLY INTO THE NATURE OF GOD
WHY DON'T THEY GRANT THAT THE RIGHT INCLINATION OF THE HEART TOWARD GOD THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST MUST PRECEDE WORKS
PAUL HIMSELF CRIED OUT
ALL THE PROMISES OF GOD WERE FULFILLED IN THE GIFT OF HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE THE GOSPEL IS REASSURANCE FOR SINNERS
THEY GET WILD WHEN THEY ARE TOLD THAT THIS QUALITY OF THE HEART CANNOT JUSTIFY A PERSON
DO YOU THINK THE SCHOOLBOY FEELS GOOD ABOUT IT
THE LAW-WORKERS FAIL TO DO THIS
THESE TWO STATEMENTS ARE NOT AT ALL INCONSISTENT
THAT IS THE TRUE PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF THE LAW
IT IS BUILT ON THE PROMISES AND TRUTH OF GOD
HE WILL THEN UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF PAUL'S WORDS
I KNOW IN WHAT SLIPPERY PLACES EVEN THOSE STAND WHO SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD FOOTING IN THE MATTERS OF FAITH
FOR I TESTIFY AGAIN TO EVERY MAN THAT IS CIRCUMCISED THAT HE IS A DEBTOR TO DO THE WHOLE LAW
MATTHIAS WAS CALLED IN THIS MANNER
THESE TERMS ARE SO FAMILIAR THAT THEY DO NOT REQUIRE LENGTHY EXPLANATIONS
THE FALSE APOSTLES USED THIS ARGUMENT AGAINST PAUL
DAVID WAS A GOOD KING
PEOPLE EASILY MISTAKE CIVIL RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR SPIRITUAL RIGHTEOUSNESS
FOR CHRIST'S YOKE IS EASY AND HIS BURDEN IS LIGHT WHEN SIN HAS BEEN PARDONED AND THE CONSCIENCE HAS BEEN EASED OF ITS DREADFUL LOAD A CHRISTIAN CAN ENDURE ALL THINGS IN CHRIST
BUT RECEIVED ME AS AN ANGEL OF GOD EVEN AS CHRIST JESUS
THEY APPROVED MY MINISTRY
THE APOSTLE WANTS TO STIR UP HIS READERS TO BE GENEROUS TO THEIR PASTORS
PAUL SPOKE DISPARAGINGLY OF THESE ORDINANCES BECAUSE THE FALSE APOSTLES ASSERTED THAT MANKIND IS SAVED BY THEM WITHOUT FAITH
WHEREFORE CRIEST THOU UNTO ME MOSES HAD NOT CRIED UNTO THE LORD
HE DOES NOT ONLY FEEL LIKE A SINNER HE FEELS LIKE SIN ITSELF

I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE MY CHURCH PERVERTED BY SOME FANATIC THROUGH ONE OR TWO SERMONS
BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER YOU WILL NOTICE THAT CHRIST'S MERIT IS BELITTLED WHILE MONKISH MERITS ARE AGGRANDIZED
ON THE CONTRARY YOU WERE SO LOVING SO KIND SO FRIENDLY TOWARDS ME YOU RECEIVED ME LIKE AN ANGEL LIKE JESUS HIMSELF INDEED THE GALATIANS ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR RECEIVING THE GOSPEL FROM A MAN AS UNIMPOSING AND AFFLICTED ALL AROUND AS PAUL WAS
THE SINS OF THE WORLD GOT HIM DOWN FOR A MOMENT
NOW LET CHRIST WITH HIS GRACIOUS LIPS TALK TO HIM OF BETTER THINGS GRACE PEACE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND ETERNAL LIFE
THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AREN'T UP YET
THE TIMES OF THE LAW ARE DISCERNIBLE BY HEAVINESS OF HEART BY A LIVELY SENSE OF SIN AND A FEELING OF DESPAIR BROUGHT ON BY THE LAW
THOSE WHO SIN THROUGH WEAKNESS ARE NOT DENIED PARDON AS LONG AS THEY RISE AGAIN AND CEASE TO SIN
PAUL REFERS TO THE FACT THAT THE OTHER APOSTLES REMAINED IN JERUSALEM UNTIL THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CITY BECAME IMMINENT
NOW AS GOD GAVE THE HOLY GHOST TO THE GENTILES WITHOUT THE LAW BY THE SIMPLE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL SO HE GAVE THE HOLY GHOST ALSO TO THE JEWS WITHOUT THE LAW THROUGH FAITH ALONE
THE WORLD BEARS THE GOSPEL A GRUDGE BECAUSE THE GOSPEL CONDEMNS THE RELIGIOUS WISDOM OF THE WORLD
FOR WE THROUGH THE SPIRIT WAIT FOR THE HOPE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH
IT MUST NOT STEP OUT OF CHARACTER AND TAKE THE PLACE OF ANYTHING ELSE
WITH THE WORDS THAT HE MIGHT DELIVER US PAUL ARGUES THAT WE STAND IN NEED OF CHRIST
AT OUR PREACHING OF FAITH GOD GAVE TO THE HEARERS THE HOLY GHOST FROM THIS FACT PAUL AND BARNABAS INFERRED THAT THE HOLY GHOST APPROVED THE FAITH OF THE GENTILES WITHOUT THE LAW AND CIRCUMCISION
WHEN WE CALL THE POPE THE ANTICHRIST AND HIS MINIONS AN EVIL BROOD WE DO NOT SLANDER THEM
THERE ARE CERTAIN MEN CREPT IN UNAWARES...TURNING THE GRACE OF OUR GOD INTO LASCIVIOUSNESS JUDE 4 THE FLESH REASONS
THIS UNION WITH CHRIST DELIVERS ME FROM THE DEMANDS OF THE LAW AND SEPARATES ME FROM MY SINFUL SELF
CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT IT
AND TO MY GOD AND YOUR GOD GOD IS OUR FATHER AND OUR GOD BUT ONLY IN CHRIST JESUS
HOLY WORKS YOU KNOW
THEY SAID TO PAUL
EVERY PROMISE OF GOD IS A RATIFIED PROMISE WHY WAS THE LAW ADDED TO THE PROMISE
YOU MUST KNOW THE MANNERS OF YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU MUST NOT HATE THEM SUCH A GENTLE PERSON WAS OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST AS THE GOSPEL PORTRAYS HIM
PAUL MINDS THE RULE WHICH HE HIMSELF LAYS DOWN IN A LATER CHAPTER WHERE HE SAYS
ANY CHANGES OR ADDITIONS WERE DEFERRED TO THE TIME OF CHRIST'S COMING
IF NO PERSECUTION NO CROSS OR REPROACH TRAILED THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOSPEL BUT ONLY PRAISE AND REPUTATION THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL WOULD CHOKE WITH PRIDE
IF HE COULD ESCAPE HE WOULD GO RIGHT BACK TO ROBBING AND KILLING
OBSERVE THE CONSUMMATE CLEVERNESS WITH WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES WENT ABOUT TO BRING PAUL INTO DISREPUTE
PAUL EXPLAINED THE PURPOSE OF THESE MIRACULOUS GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT IN I CORINTHIANS 14:22 TONGUES ARE FOR A SIGN NOT TO THEM THAT BELIEVE BUT TO THEM THAT BELIEVE NOT ONCE THE CHURCH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AND PROPERLY ADVERTISED BY THESE MIRACLES THE VISIBLE APPEARANCE OF THE HOLY GHOST CEASED
FOR I BEAR IN MY BODY THE MARKS OF THE LORD JESUS
FIRST BY THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS HYPOCRITES WHO FANCY THAT THEY CAN BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
IT GOES TO SHOW THAT OUR DOCTRINE IS OF GOD ELSE BEHEMOTH WOULD LIE UNDER SHADY TREES IN THE COVERT OF THE REED AND FENS THE FACT THAT HE IS AGAIN WALKING ABOUT AS A ROARING LION TO STIR UP RIOTS AND DISORDERS IS A SURE SIGN THAT HE HAS BEGUN TO FEEL THE EFFECT OF OUR PREACHING
THE APOSTLE'S MEANING IS CLEAR
IF YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS TO DO GOOD WORKS I WILL TELL YOU IN ONE WORD HOW YOU CAN FULFILL ALL LAWS
GOD NOT ONLY PARDONED OUR INIQUITIES BUT IN ADDITION OVERWHELMED US WITH BLESSINGS AND SPIRITUAL GIFTS
DOES IT NOT THEN MAKE MEN RIGHTEOUS
BECAUSE THE SHADOW OF CHRIST'S WING COVERS ME I HAVE NO FEAR THAT GOD WILL COVER ALL MY SINS AND TAKE MY IMPERFECTIONS FOR PERFECT RIGHTEOUSNESS
ROERER TOOK DOWN LUTHER'S LECTURES AND THIS MANUSCRIPT HAS BEEN PRESERVED TO THE PRESENT DAY IN A COPY WHICH CONTAINS ALSO ADDITIONS BY VEIT DIETRICH AND BY CRUCIGER FRIENDS OF ROERER'S WHO WITH HIM ATTENDED LUTHER'S LECTURES
WE ARE NOT NOW TREATING OF AN UNIMPORTANT MATTER
CRUCIFIED AMONG YOU
IN THE HEART FEAR AND TRUST SIN AND GRACE LAW AND GOSPEL CROSS PATHS CONTINUALLY
BEFORE HE DIGRESSED PAUL STATED THAT THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
BUT INSTEAD OF REVEALING THE GRACE OF GOD RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE THE LAW BRINGS SIN DEATH AND THE WRATH OF GOD TO LIGHT
THEN THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER KIND OF LIBERTY WHEN PEOPLE OBEY NEITHER THE LAWS OF GOD NOR THE LAWS OF MEN BUT DO AS THEY PLEASE
PAUL THEREFORE ADMONISHES BOTH TEACHERS AND HEARERS NOT TO ESTEEM LIGHTLY THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH AS IF IT WERE A TOY WITH WHICH TO AMUSE ONESELF IN IDLE HOURS
OUR RECTITUDE DATES FROM OUR BIRTH BECAUSE THE JEWISH RELIGION IS NATURAL TO US
SO THEN BRETHREN WE ARE NOT CHILDREN OF THE BONDWOMAN BUT OF THE FREE
LET US NOT BE DESIROUS OF VAIN GLORY
IN THE WORD OF GOD ALL THINGS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO WORKS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAITH
ABRAHAM BELIEVED
HE DOES NOT BUSY HIMSELF WITH THE LAW
THEY ONLY WEAR EACH OTHER OUT
IN ORDER TO BRING THIS TO PASS THEY GO ABOUT TO ALIENATE YOUR HEARTS FROM ME AND TO MAKE ME OBNOXIOUS TO YOU IN THIS WAY PAUL BRINGS THE FALSE APOSTLES INTO SUSPICION
FOR CHRIST CAME INTO THE WORLD TO RECONCILE GOD WITH US AND TO DRAW US TO THE FATHER
THAT WAS AN AWFUL THING FOR YOU TO DO
WE DO NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF OUR FALSE BRETHREN
MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD THE APOSTLE ADDS TO THE SALUTATION THE WORDS AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
SOON AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HOWEVER THESE GALATIAN CHURCHES WERE THROWN INTO CONFUSION BY THE FALSE APOSTLES
ERGO THE CHURCH IS ABOVE THE GOSPEL WITH EQUAL FORCE ONE MIGHT ARGUE
WHAT WILL NOT THE LAW DO IN THE CASE OF THE WICKED WHO DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT
BEHIND HIS APPARENT DISAPPOINTMENT AT THEIR FAILURE LURKS THE SHARP REPRIMAND THAT THEY HAD FORSAKEN CHRIST AND THAT THEY WERE PROVING THEMSELVES TO BE OBSTINATE UNBELIEVERS
CHRIST REIGNS IN THE HEART WITH HIS HOLY SPIRIT WHO SEES HEARS SPEAKS WORKS SUFFERS AND DOES ALL THINGS IN AND THROUGH US OVER THE PROTEST AND THE RESISTANCE OF THE FLESH
I DID NOT SO CONFER WITH THE APOSTLES THAT THEY TAUGHT ME ANYTHING
PAUL NOT ONLY HAD OUTWARD AFFLICTIONS BUT ALSO INNER SPIRITUAL AFFLICTIONS
LET THE POPE PERISH
LISTEN
WHILE PETER YET SPAKE THESE WORDS THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON ALL THEM WHICH HEARD THE WORD ACTS 10:44 AND AS I BEGAN TO SPEAK THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON THEM AS ON US AT THE BEGINNING ACTS 11:15 TRY TO APPRECIATE THE FORCE OF PAUL'S ARGUMENT WHICH IS SO OFTEN REPEATED IN THE BOOK OF ACTS
WHEN I WAS A MONK I OFTEN WISHED I COULD SEE A SAINT
BUT WITH THE FLESH THE LAW OF SIN ROMANS 7:25 AS FAR AS THE CONSCIENCE IS CONCERNED IT MAY CHEERFULLY IGNORE THE LAW
9:1 THEY TAKE THIS HATRED TO MEAN THE WRATH OF GOD TO COME
WE HAVE THE SAME GIFTS THAT THEY HAD THE SAME CHRIST THE SAME BAPTISM AND THE SAME GOSPEL THE SAME FORGIVENESS OF SINS
WE ARE TO KNOW THAT IT PLEASED GOD FREELY TO GIVE US HIS UNSPEAKABLE GIFTS
THIS SORT OF PREACHING PROCURES FOR US THE HATRED AND DISFAVOR OF THE WORLD PERSECUTIONS EXCOMMUNICATIONS MURDERS AND CURSES
YOU MAY ARGUE THAT THE CHURCH AND THE FATHERS ARE HOLY
THIS PRAISE PAUL BESTOWS ON NONE OF THE OTHER CHURCHES TO WHICH HE WROTE
HE KNOWS THAT WE ARE WEAK AND CANNOT STAND ANYTHING LONG
BUT I CERTIFY YOU BRETHREN THAT THE GOSPEL WHICH WAS PREACHED OF ME IS NOT AFTER MAN
HE THAT SITTETH IN THE HEAVENS SHALL LAUGH
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REFORMATION WE WERE HONORED AS THE TRUE MINISTERS OF CHRIST
9:9 IN THE PSALMS WE ARE REPEATEDLY TOLD TO BE JOYFUL IN THE LORD PAUL SAYS
IF WE LIVE IN THE SPIRIT LET US ALSO WALK IN THE SPIRIT
THEY CAME AROUND HIM LIKE WATER
CHRIST ABIDING IN ME DRIVES OUT EVERY EVIL
IT IS THE ABOMINATION STANDING IN THE HOLY PLACE
FAITH IN CHRIST WILL LIFT YOU HIGH ABOVE THE LAW INTO THE HEAVEN OF GRACE
BUT THEY CAME TO THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA KNOWING THAT WHERE MEN PROFESS THE NAME OF CHRIST THEY MAY FEEL SECURE
BUT THEY REVEALED THEMSELVES AS FALSE BRETHREN AND DEADLY ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL
TO REVEAL HIS SON TO ME
YET IN THE ACTUAL CONFLICT WITH THE DEVIL WHEN HE SCARES US WITH THE LAW WHEN HE FRIGHTENS US WITH THE VERY PERSON OF THE MEDIATOR WHEN HE MISQUOTES THE WORDS OF CHRIST AND DISTORTS FOR US OUR SAVIOR WE SO EASILY LOSE SIGHT OF OUR SWEET HIGH-PRIEST
HE DID NOT GO TO JERUSALEM TO BE INSTRUCTED OR CONFIRMED IN HIS GOSPEL BY THE OTHER APOSTLES
INSTEAD OF WORSHIPPING THE TRUE GOD THEY WORSHIP THE VAIN IMAGINATIONS OF THEIR FOOLISH HEARTS
THE HEART MUST BE PURIFIED BY FAITH BEFORE A PERSON CAN LIFT A FINGER TO PLEASE GOD
20:2 3 6 12 ARE THESE NOT EXCELLENT LAWS PERFECT WISDOM
HENCE HE IS ABOVE CHRIST PAUL SUBORDINATES HIMSELF ALL PREACHERS ALL THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN EVERYBODY TO THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
THIS PASSAGE CONTAINS EXCELLENT DOCTRINE AND MUCH COMFORT
WHEN YOU MEET A WILLFUL SINNER WHO DOES NOT CARE GO AFTER HIM AND REBUKE HIM SHARPLY BUT THIS IS NOT THE TREATMENT FOR ONE WHO HAS BEEN OVERTAKEN BY A SIN AND IS SORRY
TODAY WE HEAR THE SAME COMPLAINTS
THIS DISCIPLINE HOWEVER IS NOT TO LAST FOREVER
BEING MORE EXCEEDINGLY ZEALOUS OF THE TRADITIONS OF MY FATHERS
HE MUST BE DEALT WITH IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS AND NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF SEVERITY
YOU HAVE TAKEN ON TEACHERS WHO INTEND TO RECOMMIT YOU TO THE LAW
THE OTHER DANGER AGAINST WHICH THE APOSTLE WARNS THE GALATIANS IS THIS
WHEN THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION IS LOST NOTHING REMAINS EXCEPT ERROR HYPOCRISY GODLESSNESS AND IDOLATRY
FIRST WE MUST RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO ENLIGHTENS AND SANCTIFIES US SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO DO THE LAW I.E TO LOVE GOD AND OUR NEIGHBOR
THUS PAUL STOOD DEFAMED AMONG THE GALATIANS
TO PUT ON CHRIST MAY BE UNDERSTOOD IN TWO WAYS ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL
IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A HOLY ACT WHEN THE MONKS IN THEIR CELLS MEDITATE UPON GOD AND HIS WORKS AND IN A RELIGIOUS FRENZY KNEEL DOWN TO PRAY AND TO WEEP FOR JOY
THE THIEF ON THE CROSS
PAUL CHOSE TWO WITNESSES BARNABAS AND TITUS
HE HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO INVEST HIMSELF WITH THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF SINNERS
NOT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BUT BECAUSE HE HAS TO
TO HOLD ON TO IT THAT IS THE TRICK
LET IT NOT BE GRIEVOUS IN THY SIGHT BECAUSE OF THE LAD AND BECAUSE OF THY BONDWOMAN
THEREFORE YOU OUGHT TO LISTEN TO NO TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THE GOSPEL
PAUL INCRIMINATES THE GALATIANS IN WORSE FAILURE
BUT SEE TO IT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THEM
FOR NEVER CAN TOO MUCH GLORY GOODNESS AND MERCY BE ASCRIBED UNTO GOD THESE WORDS OF THE WORTHY DOCTOR COMFORTED AND CONFIRMED ME
HE DID NOT GO UP TO JERUSALEM TO SIT AT THE FEET OF PETER AND THE OTHER APOSTLES
MOSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
AGAINST SUCH THERE IS NO LAW
WE MEET WITH SUCH CONTEMPT FOR THE WORD OF GOD MOSTLY AMONG THE COMMON PEOPLE
FOR ALL HAVE SINNED AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD ROMANS 3:23 LET THE JEWS LET THE GREEKS LET THE WHOLE WORLD KEEP SILENT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD
HE WAS FORCED TO ATTACK THE FALSE APOSTLES
BUT WHAT HIS WILL IS TOWARD THEM THEY DO NOT KNOW
I MUST CONFESS THAT IN TIMES OF TEMPTATION I DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO DO IT
AND BEAR IN MIND THAT PAUL IS NOT NOW DISCUSSING THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST BUT THE SALVATION OF CHRIST
CHRIST'S DISCIPLES BROKE THE SABBATH LAW WHEN THEY PLUCKED THE EARS OF CORN
IN MATTHEW 7:11 CHRIST HIMSELF ARGUED FROM EARTHLY TO HEAVENLY THINGS WHEN HE SAID
HE PERFORMS HIS DUTY ACCORDING TO HIS VOCATION
FAITH ORIGINATES IN THE UNDERSTANDING WHILE HOPE RISES IN THE WILL
WE DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND IT
NOT A SINGLE ONE COULD STAND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GLORIOUS LORD
HERE LET ME SAY THAT THESE THREE THINGS FAITH CHRIST AND IMPUTATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE TO BE JOINED TOGETHER
AND BECAUSE YE ARE SONS GOD HATH SENT FORTH THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON INTO YOUR HEARTS
19:17 WITH HIS OWN WORDS THEY DENY CHRIST AND ABOLISH FAITH IN HIM
THIS I HAVE DONE THIS I HAVE NOT DONE BUT FAITH LOOKS TO JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD GIVEN INTO DEATH FOR THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD
NOWADAYS THERE ARE MANY SUCH IDOLATERS WHO WANT TO BE COUNTED AMONG THE TRUE CONFESSORS OF THE GOSPEL
AS TO THE CONTENTION OF OUR OPPONENTS THAT CORNELIUS DESERVED GRACE AND THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE HE WAS DEVOUT AND JUST WE SAY THAT THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SPIRITUAL PERSON WHO ALREADY HAS FAITH IN CHRIST AND NOT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GENTILE OR OF NATURAL MAN
CHRIST IS A LOVER OF POOR SINNERS AND SUCH A LOVER THAT HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR US
NO PERSON IS FREE FROM TEMPTATIONS
WHEN WE BELIEVE IN THE LAW WE MAY BE ACTIVE ENOUGH BUT WE HAVE NO LIFE
THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF IN ADDING SUCH PRECEPTS OF LOVE THE APOSTLE EMBARRASSES THE FALSE APOSTLES VERY MUCH AS IF HE WERE SAYING TO THE GALATIANS
WHY SHOULD I BE ANGRY WITH YOU SINCE YOU HAVE DONE ME NO INJURY AT ALL TO THIS THE GALATIANS REPLY
GOD DOES NOT BLESS THEIR LABORS
IN THIS DEVIL'S KINGDOM WE LIVE
YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM REJOICED TO SEE MY DAY
IN BESEECHING THE GALATIANS TO BE AS HE IS PAUL EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HOLD THE SAME AFFECTION FOR HIM THAT HE HOLDS FOR THEM
WE ARE NOT TO ATTRIBUTE PERFECTION TO ANY MAN
THE SCHOLASTICS TAKE THE LUST OF THE FLESH TO MEAN CARNAL LUST
THE OLD TESTAMENT IS MOUNT SINAI THE BONDWOMAN HAGAR
PAUL MEANS TO SAY THAT HE LEARNED HIS GOSPEL NOT IN THE USUAL AND ACCEPTED MANNER THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN BY HEARING READING OR WRITING
WHETHER AN UNGRATEFUL WORLD APPRECIATES HIS EFFORTS IS TO GIVE HIM NO CONCERN BECAUSE AFTER ALL HE IS IN THE MINISTRY NOT FOR HIS OWN GLORY BUT FOR THE GLORY OF CHRIST A FAITHFUL MINISTER CARES LITTLE WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF HIM AS LONG AS HIS CONSCIENCE APPROVES OF HIM
HE ASKED NO MAN TO TEACH HIM
EVERYBODY CAN SEE THAT MY PREACHING HAS STIRRED UP PERSECUTION AGAINST ME EVERYWHERE AND HAS EARNED FOR ME THE CRUEL HATRED OF MY OWN PEOPLE IN FACT THE HATRED OF ALL MEN
IS THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW REQUISITE UNTO JUSTIFICATION
YOU ARE NOW GROVELING IN THE DIRT
BUT THEY DEFEND AND UPHOLD THEIR DOCTRINE OF WORKS WHICH IS OF THE DEVIL
CHRIST SAID
THE CIVIL LAWS OF MOSES DO NOT CONCERN US AND SHOULD NOT BE PUT BACK IN FORCE
NOT WITH WISDOM OF WORDS LEST THE CROSS OF CHRIST SHOULD BE MADE OF NONE EFFECT I COR
PLEASE DIRECT ANY COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS TO
THOSE WHO LEAST DESERVE THE PRAISE OF THE WORLD GET MOST
INSTEAD THEY INVENT NEW MODES OF WORSHIP AND NEW KINDS OF WORKS WHICH GOD NEVER COMMANDED
THEREFORE WE ARE NOT PROUD BECAUSE OF THEM
THEN IS THE SEASON OF THE LAW WHEN THE FLESH LUSTETH AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH THE TIME OF GRACE RETURNS WHEN THE HEART IS ENLIVENED BY THE PROMISE OF GOD'S MERCY
PEOPLE HEAR A COUPLE OF SERMONS SCAN A FEW PAGES OF HOLY WRIT AND THINK THEY KNOW IT ALL
THE LAW THUNDERS
THEIR ONLY REQUIREMENT WAS THAT CIRCUMCISION DAYS MONTHS YEARS AND TIMES SHOULD BE OBSERVED
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF ALL THEIR OWN TROUBLES
HOW CAN THE CHURCH BE HOLY YOU ASK
THE HOLY SPIRIT SPEAKS OF FAITH IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
EVERYBODY FINDS FAULT WITH US
WHEN PEOPLE SCRAPE UP EVERYTHING THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON AND KEEP EVERYTHING FOR THEMSELVES THE APOSTLE CALLS IT A SOWING TO THE FLESH
GOD WANTS US TO EXALT HIS WORD AND NOT MEN
LIKE PAUL ALL PASTORS AND MINISTERS OUGHT TO HAVE MUCH SYMPATHY FOR THEIR POOR STRAYING SHEEP AND INSTRUCT THEM IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS
WE TAKE GREAT PAINS IN SETTING FORTH THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BY PREACHING AND BY WRITING
THE HEARER LIKES TO REASON LIKE THIS
OUR OPPONENTS CLAIM THAT THEY ALSO POSSESS THIS LIBERTY
IN DUE TIME HE APPOINTS THE LAD HEIR TO HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE
I AM FREE NOW AND A SON OF GOD
WE GO AHEAD BY HONOUR AND DISHONOUR BY EVIL REPORT AND GOOD REPORT II COR
THEY DO NOT SERVE THE TRUE GOD BUT AN IDOL OF THEIR OWN INVENTION
HIS CASE WAS PARALLEL TO THAT OF PETER'S WHO WAS PARTICULARLY COMMISSIONED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE JEWS
HOLY WRIT DOES NOT SAY THAT CHRIST WAS UNDER THE CURSE
WHEN SIN DEATH AND THE WRATH OF GOD ARE REVEALED TO A PERSON BY THE LAW HE GROWS IMPATIENT COMPLAINS AGAINST GOD AND REBELS
I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRUTH OF THIS
18:15 GOD'S PEOPLE OF OLD FELT THAT THE LAW OF MOSES COULD NOT BE IMPROVED UPON UNTIL THE MESSIAH WOULD BRING BETTER THINGS THAN THE LAW I.E GRACE AND REMISSION OF SINS
CHRIST HAS REDEEMED US FROM THE LAW THE CONSCIENCE CAN NOW HOLD ITS HEAD HIGH AND SAY TO THE LAW
IF THOSE WHO ARE ALWAYS SO EAGER TO CONDEMN OTHERS WOULD INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FIND THAT THE SINS OF OTHERS ARE MOTES IN COMPARISON TO THEIR OWN WHEREFORE LET HIM THAT THINKETH HE STANDETH TAKE HEED LEST HE FALL I COR
FOR AS MANY OF YOU AS HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST HAVE PUT ON CHRIST
HUMAN REASON CAN THINK ONLY IN TERMS OF THE LAW
TRUE THAT BOOK CONTAINS NO MENTION OF THE LAW
THE TEACHERS YOU HAVE NOW DO NOT SEEK THE GLORY OF CHRIST AND THE SALVATION OF YOUR SOULS BUT ONLY THEIR OWN GLORY
THERE IS MUCH DISPARITY AMONG MEN IN THE WORLD BUT THERE IS NO SUCH DISPARITY BEFORE GOD
EVEN IF YOU CANNOT COMPLETELY OVERCOME IT AT LEAST YOU OUGHT TO FIGHT AGAINST IT
BUT THAT IS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO
HE DOES NOT NOW ADDRESS THEM AS HIS BRETHREN AS HE USUALLY DOES
THIS I WOULD DO IF I SHOULD PRESUME TO PURCHASE FOR MYSELF THE FAVOR OF GOD AND EVERLASTING LIFE BY MY GOOD DEEDS OR IF I SHOULD DESPAIR OF MY SALVATION BECAUSE OF MY SINS VERSE 3
HE PREFERS TO CARRY ON HIS NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES IN THE NAME OF GOD
PAUL HAD SUCH TRUST IN THE GALATIANS ALTHOUGH THEY HAD FORSAKEN HIS DOCTRINE
THE HARD SAYINGS OF SCRIPTURE AND THE AWFUL JUDGMENTS OF GOD UPON SIN MUST BE IMPRESSED UPON THEM
NEITHER ARE WE TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE FOOLISH AND UNGODLY PEOPLE FOR ABUSING OUR DOCTRINE
SUCH CURSING IS THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST
PREACH THE WORD
I HAVE OVERCOME THE WORLD VERSE 30
IF YOU WANT TO SERVE GOD YOU MUST EARN YOUR OWN REMISSION OF SINS AND EVERLASTING LIFE AND IN ADDITION HELP OTHERS TO OBTAIN SALVATION BY GIVING THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR EXTRA WORK-HOLINESS MONKS FRIARS AND ALL THE REST OF THEM BRAG THAT BESIDES THE ORDINARY REQUIREMENTS COMMON TO ALL CHRISTIANS THEY DO THE WORKS OF SUPEREROGATION I.E THE PERFORMANCE OF MORE THAN IS REQUIRED
THEY DO NOT WRESTLE AGAINST SIN
I HAVE KNOWN MONKS WHO ZEALOUSLY LABORED TO PLEASE GOD FOR SALVATION BUT THE MORE THEY LABORED THE MORE IMPATIENT MISERABLE UNCERTAIN AND FEARFUL THEY BECAME
YOU CRUCIFIED THE SON OF GOD
WHAT SHOULD HE DO
TO FEEL THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH IS NOT WITHOUT PROFIT TO US
HE DECLARES THAT HE DOES NOT CARE FOR THE LAW THAT HE DOES NOT INTEND EVER TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
PEOPLE BLAME US AND THE GOSPEL FOR EVERYTHING FOR THE DISOBEDIENCE OF SUBJECTS TO THEIR RULERS FOR WARS PLAGUES AND FAMINES FOR REVOLUTIONS AND EVERY OTHER EVIL THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
THE MORE I PAID ATTENTION TO THE REGULATIONS THE MORE I TRANSGRESSED THEM
AFTERWARDS I CAME INTO THE REGIONS OF SYRIA AND CILICIA
HE HAS AN IDEA TO DESTROY ALL LIFE
THEY LIVED A CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WERE ON THE RIGHT WAY TO EVERLASTING LIFE
FOR IF THERE HAD BEEN A LAW GIVEN WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN LIFE VERILY RIGHTEOUSNESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE LAW
OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD LIE WHEN HE WRITES WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS I DO NOT BOTHER MY HEAD WITH SPECULATIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
HE THEREFORE SENT HIS ONLY SON INTO THE WORLD AND SAID TO HIM
THE FALSE APOSTLES CONSTRAINED THE GALATIANS TO OBSERVE THESE JEWISH FEASTS UNDER THREAT OF DAMNATION
WITH PAUL WE GLORY IN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST
ST JOHN SAYS
TO DESIRE VAINGLORY IS TO DESIRE LIES BECAUSE WHEN ONE PERSON PRAISES ANOTHER HE TELLS LIES
FROM PETER'S EXAMPLE THE GENTILES COULD NOT HELP BUT DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LAW WAS NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION
LET THIS BE OUR RESOLUTION THAT WE WILL SUFFER THE LOSS OF ALL THINGS THE LOSS OF OUR GOOD NAME OF LIFE ITSELF BUT THE GOSPEL AND OUR FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST--WE WILL NOT STAND FOR IT THAT ANYBODY TAKE THEM FROM US
HE TELLS THEM
CHRIST IS MADE TO LOSE HIS GOOD NAME HIS OFFICE AND HIS GLORY AND IS DEMOTED TO THE STATUS OF A LAW ENFORCER REPROVING TERRIFYING AND CHASING POOR SINNERS AROUND
THESE ARE NOT NEW TRUTHS
BY HIS EXAMPLE HE ENCOURAGED GENTILES AND JEWS TO FORSAKE THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
THE PURE DOCTRINE TAKES PRECEDENCE BEFORE CHARITY APOSTLES OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN
THIRDLY THEY DIFFER IN REGARD TO THEIR OBJECTIVES
THE JEWS WERE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CHURCH WOULD NOT LONG ENDURE
I DETEST THE DOCTRINE THE SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE WORKS OF THE WORLD
HENCE THEIR BEST SPIRITUAL THOUGHTS ARE WICKED THOUGHTS
THEY GRANT THAT A PERSON MUST BE RIGHT BEFORE HE CAN DO RIGHT
JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER PRICE IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH BIG AND GOOD ENOUGH WAS IT NECESSARY FOR THE SON OF GOD TO BE DELIVERED FOR ME
THE LUST OF THE FLESH IS NOT ALTOGETHER EXTINCT IN US
WOULD YOU CALL IT BESEECHING THE GALATIANS TO CALL THEM BEWITCHED DISOBEDIENT CRUCIFIERS OF CHRIST
YOU WOULD NOT CALL SUCH LAWS ELEMENTS OF HEAVEN
INDEED CHRIST HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SINS
I CONCLUDE THEREFORE THAT IT IS UP TO CHRIST TO OVERCOME MY SINS AND NOT UP TO THE LAW OR MY OWN EFFORTS
ALL THE INFLUENTIAL AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OF HIS DAY DENOUNCED HIM
DAVID WHO KILLED A LION AND A BEAR AND DEFEATED GOLIATH IS MENTIONED
THE PROPHETS CHRIST THE APOSTLES WERE SLAIN
ALL OF THESE VILIFICATIONS CANNOT DISCOURAGE US
MANY HAD DISOWNED HIM AS THEIR TEACHER AND GONE OVER TO THE FALSE APOSTLES
PAUL IS SO VERY MUCH IN EARNEST ABOUT THIS MATTER THAT HE CONFIRMS IT WITH AN OATH
I WILL LISTEN TO CHRIST WHO SAYS THAT HE CAME INTO THE WORLD TO SAVE SINNERS
BUT NOT ALL THE GALATIANS OBEYED THE WARNING OF PAUL
HE CAN SAY
PETER WAS DELIVERED FROM PRISON YET THE PRISON REMAINS
AS LONG AS HE STAYS IN PRISON HE REFRAINS FROM EVIL DEEDS
THE LAW INSPIRES HATRED OF GOD
YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EMANCIPATION AND GIVE GENEROUSLY FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL AND THE RELIEF OF IMPOVERISHED CHRISTIANS
DESPITE THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF PAUL'S STATEMENT OUR ENEMIES FAIL TO GRASP IT
WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
AS HAGAR BORE ABRAHAM A SON WHO WAS NOT AN HEIR BUT A SERVANT SO SINAI THE LAW THE ALLEGORICAL HAGAR BORE GOD A CARNAL AND SERVILE PEOPLE OF THE LAW WITHOUT PROMISE
PETER ALSO FELL GRIEVOUSLY WHEN HE DENIED CHRIST
THE CONSCIENCE MUST BE KEPT ABOVE THE LAW THE BODY UNDER THE LAW
WE OBEY THE LAW BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WE WILL BE PUNISHED
BUT BECAUSE THE MESSIAH HAD ALREADY COME CORNELIUS HAD TO BE APPRIZED OF THE FACT
BUT I KNOW I AM YOUR CHILD BECAUSE YOU ARE MY FATHER FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
DAVID THE ADULTERER
THE HOLY SPIRIT ENABLES THEM TO LOVE GOD AND THEIR NEIGHBOR
THE APOSTLE PAUL MANIFESTS HIS APOSTOLIC CARE FOR THE GALATIANS
THE LAW MEANS TO ENLARGE MY SINS TO MAKE ME SMALL SO THAT I MAY BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN CHRIST
AND FOR SIN CONDEMNED SIN IN THE FLESH ROMANS 8:3
GERMAN AND ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS ARE AVAILABLE BUT THE MOST ACCEPTABLE ENGLISH VERSION BESIDES LABORING UNDER THE HANDICAPS OF AN ARCHAIC STYLE HAD TO BE CONDENSED INTO HALF ITS VOLUME IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE STREAMLINING OF THE BOOK
GET THEE OUT OF THY COUNTRY ETC
BUT OUR FAITH IS WEAK BECAUSE OUR SPIRIT IS WEAK
THAT THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM MIGHT COME ON THE GENTILES THROUGH JESUS CHRIST
IN VIEW OF THIS PAUL DECLARES THAT CHRIST BEGAN AND NOT WE
WHAT AN EXCELLENT LAW IT IS
THERE IS A WORKING AND THERE IS A BELIEVING ABRAHAM
IN I CORINTHIANS 13 PAUL ATTRIBUTES TO LOVE ALL THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT
ALL THESE ADVANTAGES DO NOT QUALIFY A PERSON FOR SALVATION
WHEN THIS ARTICLE IS ENDANGERED WE MUST NOT HESITATE TO RESIST PETER OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN
THE APOSTLE HAD APPARENTLY FINISHED HIS DISCOURSE ON JUSTIFICATION WHEN THIS ILLUSTRATION OF THE YOUTHFUL HEIR OCCURRED TO HIM
HOW LITTLE LOVE IS LOST UPON THEM THE JEWS SHOWED BY THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MOSES
YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOUR LIFE IS IN ACCORD WITH CHRIST'S PRECEPTS OR EXAMPLE
I WOULD THEY WERE EVEN CUT OFF WHICH TROUBLE YOU
THE DIGNITY OR AUTHORITY OF MEN MEANS NOTHING TO GOD
BARNABAS HAD BEEN PAUL'S PREACHING COMPANION TO THE GENTILES
THIS EXPLAINS WHY MEN FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW PROPERLY WITH THE RESULT THAT THEY BECOME SECURE AND PRESUMPTUOUS HYPOCRITES
FALSE DOCTRINE
ACTS 2:3 THIS VISIBLE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS NECESSARY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EARLY CHURCH AS WERE ALSO THE MIRACLES THAT ACCOMPANIED THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST
THEY PUT US DOWN AS CONTENTIOUS ILL-TEMPERED FAULTFINDERS
THEY DESPISE THE WEAK AND DEMAND THAT EVERYTHING BE JUST SO
PAUL TAKES THE FALSE APOSTLES TO TASK FOR THEIR FLATTERY
TO SPEAK OF FORMED OR UNFORMED FAITH A SORT OF DOUBLE FAITH IS CONTRARY TO THE SCRIPTURES
MR LAW I AM A SINNER
SO FAR THE WORDS OF PAUL WERE ADDRESSED TO PETER
GO IN PEACE THE JEWS DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR THE PROPHET SAY THIS
NO MERITS ARE MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROMISE OF THE SPIRIT AND ALL THE BLESSINGS THAT GO WITH HIM
BUT PAUL ALSO KNEW THAT THE GOSPEL WAS NOT TO BLAME
WE USE THE ARGUMENT OF TIME ALSO
I FOLLOW THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT WHEN THE FLESH BEGINS TO CUT UP THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO TAKE THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT THE WORD OF SALVATION AND FIGHT AGAINST THE FLESH
YOU ARE SLAVES OF THE LAW AND THEREFORE SLAVES OF SIN DEATH AND EVERLASTING DAMNATION
IT TOOK CHRIST TO COME BETWEEN US AND GOD AND TO RECONCILE GOD TO US
FOR THE GERMANS ARE NOT UNLIKE THE GALATIANS IN THEIR LACK OF CONSTANCY
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT CHRIST WE HAVE NO SIN
HE WAS A SINNER BURDENED WITH THE SINS OF A PAUL WHO WAS A BLASPHEMER
PAUL DID NOT CONDEMN CIRCUMCISION AS IF IT WERE A SIN TO RECEIVE IT
SUCH HOMELY EVERYDAY PERFORMANCES ARE NOT MUCH ADMIRED
WHY DOES HE NOT SAY TO THEM
HE WANTS TO FRIGHTEN THE GALATIANS WITH HIS SEVERE JUDGMENTS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES INTO AVOIDING FALSE DOCTRINE LIKE A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE
CHRIST'S FATHER AND OUR FATHER ARE ONE AND THE SAME
CHRIST IS YOUR LIBERTY AND LIFE
EVERYBODY IS TO DETERMINE HIS PECULIAR WEAKNESS AND GUARD AGAINST IT
EVEN THE MARRIED ARE NOT IMMUNE TO CARNAL LUSTS
THESE OUR ENEMIES ARE MANY
PAPISTS AND ANABAPTISTS DERIDE US BECAUSE WE SO EARNESTLY REQUIRE FAITH
IT IS WITH THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AS IT IS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CHRISTIAN
THE MOMENT LAW AND SIN CROSS INTO HEAVEN I.E YOUR CONSCIENCE KICK THEM OUT
ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF TRIALS A CHRISTIAN FEELS THE POWER OF SIN THE INFIRMITY OF HIS FLESH THE GOADING DARTS OF THE DEVIL THE AGUES OF DEATH THE SCOWL AND JUDGMENT OF GOD
BUT THEY DO NOT COUNT POINTS FOR JUSTIFICATION
YET THE CHURCH IS COMPELLED TO PRAY
BUT IT IS ONE THING TO BE TEMPTED BY THE FLESH AND ANOTHER THING TO YIELD TO THE FLESH TO DO ITS BIDDING WITHOUT FEAR OR REMORSE AND TO CONTINUE IN SIN
TO WHOM BE GLORY FOR EVER AND EVER
THE JEWS CLAIMED TO BE THE CHILDREN OF GOD BECAUSE THEY WERE THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WISE AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN THE HAND OF GOD
PAUL DECLARES WHOSOEVER SHALL DO THE WORKS OF THE LAW IS ACCURSED MOSES DECLARES WHOSOEVER SHALL NOT DO THE WORKS OF THE LAW IS ACCURSED HOW CAN THESE TWO CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BE RECONCILED
THE FACT IS THAT GOD OFTEN REJECTS JUST SUCH WHO STAND IN THE ODOR OF SANCTITY AND IN THE AURA OF IMPORTANCE
WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING THE DEVIL HATES WORSE THAN THE GOSPEL
BEING CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST AND DEAD UNTO THE LAW I MAY NOW RISE UNTO A NEW AND BETTER LIFE WE MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO PAUL'S WAY OF SPEAKING
IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MY SINS GO AND TALK TO MY FLESH
VERSES 4,5
THOSE WHO ARE STRONG ARE TO RAISE UP THE FALLEN IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS
MY CONSCIENCE IS A LADY AND A QUEEN AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LIKES OF YOU BECAUSE MY CONSCIENCE LIVES TO CHRIST UNDER ANOTHER LAW A NEW AND BETTER LAW THE LAW OF GRACE WE HAVE TWO PROPOSITIONS
ALTHOUGH THE GALATIANS HAD BEEN ENLIGHTENED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT THROUGH THE PREACHING OF FAITH SOMETHING OF THEIR NATIONAL TRAIT OF FOOLISHNESS PLUS THEIR ORIGINAL DEPRAVITY CLUNG TO THEM
WE WERE RESOLVED NOT TO PRESENT THIS ENTIRE MASS OF EXEGESIS
IT SCOLDS US
THE APOSTLE'S ATTACK UPON THE FALSE APOSTLES WAS NOT UNJUSTIFIED
THAT IS THE LIMIT
TO MENTION MY OWN CASE
IN THEIR WRITINGS THEY PLAY UP THE MERITS OF MAN AS CAN READILY BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING FORM OF ABSOLUTION USED AMONG THE MONKS
PAUL AS A TRUE APOSTLE OF FAITH ALWAYS HAS THE WORD FAITH ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE
YOU MY SON MUST PAY THE WORLD'S INIQUITY THE LAW GROWLS
MOST GLADLY THEREFORE WILL L RATHER GLORY IN MY INFIRMITIES ACCORDING TO THESE EXPRESSIONS THE GLORY OF A CHRISTIAN CONSISTS IN TRIBULATIONS REPROACHES AND INFIRMITIES
THE WORLD ADVANCES FREE WILL THE RATIONAL AND NATURAL APPROACH OF GOOD WORKS AS THE MEANS OF OBTAINING THE FORGIVENESS OF SIN
MANY THINGS OCCUR IN DAILY LIFE TO PROVOKE A PERSON'S ANGER BUT THE CHRISTIAN GETS OVER HIS ANGER BY MEEKNESS
HENCE THE GIFTS WHICH WE RECEIVE FROM THE FATHER AND FROM THE SON ARE ONE AND THE SAME
WE ARE CONDEMNED BY THE LAW DEAD BEFORE GOD
WHEN AN OFFICIAL A SERVANT A TEACHER MINDS HIS BUSINESS AND PERFORMS HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY WITHOUT CONCERNING HIMSELF ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE NOT IN HIS LINE HE MAY REJOICE IN HIMSELF
ALL MANKIND IS SO WRAPPED UP IN THIS IDEA THAT IT IS HARD TO DRAG IT OUT OF PEOPLE
A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH ADOPTS A STRANGE LAD FOR HIS SON
THROUGH CHRIST DEATH HAS LOST HER STING
WHY DID YOU NOT SAY
WITH THIS ARGUMENT PAUL SQUELCHED THE PROUD JEWS WHO GLORIED THAT THEY WERE THE CHILDREN OF GOD BECAUSE THEY WERE THE SEED AND THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
PAUL IS SAYING
PAUL IS SAYING
PAUL REPEATS THE CURSE DIRECTING IT NOW UPON OTHER PERSONS
THE CURSE OF GOD IS LIKE A FLOOD THAT SWALLOWS EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT OF FAITH
THE LAW HAS NO POWER AND AFFLUENCE TO MAKE MEN STRONG AND RICH BEFORE GOD
WHAT KIND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THIS LAW-RIGHTEOUSNESS WHEN AT THE COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES OF THE LAW MOSES AND THE SCRUBBED PEOPLE RUN AWAY FROM IT SO FAST THAT AN IRON MOUNTAIN THE RED SEA EVEN COULD NOT HAVE STOPPED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE BACK IN EGYPT ONCE AGAIN
BUT WE ARE NOT TO DEIFY THEM
GOD IS THE PARTY OFFENDED
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW THE WILL OF GOD IN CHRIST BUT YOU WORSHIPPED GODS OF YOUR OWN INVENTION THINKING THAT YOU HAD TO PERFORM THIS OR THAT LABOR WHETHER YOU UNDERSTAND THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD TO MEAN THE LAW OF MOSES OR THE RELIGIONS OF THE HEATHEN NATIONS IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
TIME DOES NOT CHANGE THE OBJECT OF TRUE FAITH OR THE HOLY SPIRIT
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED THE BLESSING PROMISED UNTO ABRAHAM COULD COME UPON THE GENTILES ONLY BY CHRIST THE SEED OF ABRAHAM
BUT THE WICKED NEVER COMPLAIN OF INNER CONFLICTS OR OF THE CAPTIVITY OF SIN
IN FACT IT HAS THE CONTRARY EFFECT
SHALL WE THEN DISCARD THE LAW
ANANIAS WAS ONLY TO BAPTIZE PAUL TO LAY HIS HANDS ON PAUL TO COMMIT THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD UNTO PAUL AND TO RECOMMEND HIM TO THE CHURCH
IN FACT THEY WOULD LOVE AND PRAISE ME
BUT HE DENIES THAT THE CONFERENCE BENEFITED OR TAUGHT HIM ANYTHING
LET THE SCOFFERS SLANDER US LET THEM SPARE US NOT
WRITING TO THE ROMANS HE DECLARES INASMUCH AS I AM THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES I MAGNIFY MINE OFFICE I.E I WANT TO BE RECEIVED NOT AS PAUL OF TARSUS BUT AS PAUL THE APOSTLE AND AMBASSADOR OF JESUS CHRIST IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE MORE EAGER TO HEAR
HE DOES NOT CEASE TO BE YOUR NEIGHBOR OR BROTHER BECAUSE HE OFFENDED YOU
THESE FOES OF OURS WILL CONTINUE TO FRIGHTEN US BUT NOT TOO MUCH

VERSE 2

VERSE 2
THOSE WHO WANT TO BE FIRST-CLASS SCHOLARS IN THE SCHOOL OF CHRIST WANT TO PICK UP THE LANGUAGE OF PAUL
WHEN OUR OPPONENTS GO ABOUT TO PERFORM THE LAW THEY SIN AGAINST THE FIRST THE SECOND AND THE THIRD COMMANDMENTS IN FACT THEY SIN AGAINST THE WHOLE LAW
WHO HAS SPOILED YOU THAT YOU NO LONGER LOVE ME
WHETHER A SERVANT PERFORMS HIS DUTIES WELL
BARNABAS WAS AN EYE-WITNESS OF THE FACT THAT THE HOLY GHOST HAD COME UPON THE GENTILES IN RESPONSE TO THE SIMPLE PREACHING OF FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST
JEROME AND OTHERS KNEW NOTHING OF IT
WE DO NOT MEAN TO IMPLY THAT THE LAW IS BAD
HE CALLS THEM THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT
FOR YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
FOR YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
MY HEARING IS NO LONGER DETERMINED BY THE FLESH BUT BY THE HOLY GHOST
WHICH IS NOT ANOTHER
HE WORKS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE WELFARE OF HIS FELLOWMEN
ON THE CONTRARY HE IS MIGHTY SORE THAT HE CANNOT ROB AND KILL AS BEFORE
THE WORDS IN ALL GOOD THINGS
AS THOUGH SINGLE LIFE WERE A SPIRITUAL LIFE AND MARRIED LIFE A CARNAL LIFE
THEREFORE THE LAW WAS NEVER MEANT TO CANCEL THE PROMISE OF GOD
HE DECLARES ON THE ONE HAND IN CHRIST JESUS CIRCUMCISION AVAILETH NOTHING I.E WORKS AVAIL NOTHING BUT FAITH ALONE AND THAT WITHOUT ANY MERIT WHATEVER AVAILS BEFORE GOD
WORSE BY OPENING AGAIN A WINDOW TO THE DEVIL MANY BEGIN TO LOATHE GOD'S WORD AND END BY PERVERTING THE GOSPEL
HE JUSTIFIED MANY KINGS OF EGYPT AND BABYLONIA
THY FIERCE WRATH GOETH OVER ME
GOOD LORD WHAT TERRIBLE MISCHIEF ONE SINGLE FALSE STATEMENT CAN CREATE
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ALONG WITH THEM
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE JEWS HAD THE LAW OF GOD THEY NEVER CEASED TO LOOK LONGINGLY FOR CHRIST
I PUNISHED MYSELF WITH FASTING WATCHING PRAYING AND OTHER EXERCISES MORE THAN ALL THOSE WHO TODAY HATE AND PERSECUTE ME
IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ERROR THE PAPISTS QUOTE THE SAYING OF SOLOMON
YOU DID NOT ONLY TREAT ME VERY COURTEOUSLY
WHEN A PERSON IS A CHRISTIAN HE IS ABOVE LAW AND SIN
THE WIDE DIVERGENCE IN THE TIME BETWEEN THE PROMISE AND THE LAW HELPS TO CLINCH PAUL'S ARGUMENT THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT OBTAINED BY THE LAW
NO MATTER HOW NONESSENTIAL A POINT OF DOCTRINE MAY SEEM IF SLIGHTED IT MAY PROVE THE GRADUAL DISINTEGRATION OF THE TRUTHS OF OUR SALVATION
NOT BECAUSE THE DISCIPLES WERE PHARISEES OR CIRCUMCISED OR PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE TO THE LAW
WE TOO BELIEVE IN THE CHRIST TO COME AS THE FATHERS DID IN THE OLD TESTAMENT FOR WE LOOK FOR CHRIST TO COME AGAIN ON THE LAST DAY TO JUDGE THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
THEREFORE CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS VICTORY AND LIFE ARE MINE ON THE OTHER HAND CHRIST MAY SAY
WHY THEN SHOULD WE FEEL BAD IF THE WORLD LOOKS UPON US AS RAVAGERS OF RELIGION AND INSURGENTS AGAINST CONSTITUTED AUTHORITY
BY KEEPING IN MIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL WE LET EACH PERFORM ITS SPECIAL TASK
BY MY DOCTRINE I CALLED YOU OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE INTO THE WONDERFUL LIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD
GO TO MY BRETHREN AND SAY UNTO THEM I ASCEND UNTO MY FATHER AND YOUR FATHER
AND THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD
PREACHED BEFORE THE GOSPEL UNTO ABRAHAM SAYING IN THEE SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED
BRETHREN HE SAYS IF ANY MAN BE OVERTAKEN WITH A FAULT DO NOT AGGRAVATE HIS GRIEF DO NOT SCOLD HIM DO NOT CONDEMN HIM BUT LIFT HIM UP AND GENTLY RESTORE HIS FAITH
THOU GIVEST HEAVEN TO ME NOT BECAUSE I EARNED IT BUT BECAUSE THOU HAST EARNED IT FOR ME IF ANY OF THE ROMANISTS ARE SAVED IT IS BECAUSE THEY FORGET THEIR GOOD DEEDS AND MERITS AND FEEL LIKE PAUL
A TRANSFUSION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THEREFORE BECOMES VITALLY NECESSARY
THE FATHER LOVETH YOU WHY
HE WILL SAY
TROUBLE ME NO MORE
IN SYRIA AND CILICIA PAUL WON THE INDORSEMENT OF ALL THE CHURCHES OF JUDEA BY HIS PREACHING
HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT PREVENT SUCH FULL REASSURANCE ON OUR PART
O DEATH I WILL BE THY PLAGUES
BUT BECAUSE I AM THE SERVANT OF JESUS CHRIST AND PUBLICLY DECLARE THAT NO PERSON CAN OBTAIN THE SALVATION OF HIS SOUL OUTSIDE OF CHRIST I MUST BEAR THE BADGE OF MY LORD
LET US CONDEMN AS FILTHY RAGS ALL TALK ABOUT FREE WILL ALL RELIGIOUS ORDERS MASSES CEREMONIES VOWS FASTINGS AND THE LIKE
PETER ERRED IN LIFE AND IN DOCTRINE
WHEN THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF ABSTAINING FROM MEATS WE SAY LET CHARITY GO
IF PAUL HAD NOT BROUGHT IN ADVANCE INDISPUTABLE ARGUMENTS FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH OVER AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS THIS ALLEGORY WOULD DO LITTLE GOOD
ALL EVILS WOULD HAVE OVERWHELMED US AS THEY SHALL OVERWHELM THE UNBELIEVERS FOREVER IF CHRIST HAD NOT BECOME THE GREAT TRANSGRESSOR AND GUILTY BEARER OF ALL OUR SINS
I WOULD THEY WERE EVEN CUT OFF WHICH TROUBLE YOU HE MIGHT HAVE ADDRESSED THE GALATIANS AFTER THIS FASHION
AS AN OUTGROWTH OF THIS LIBERTY WE ARE AT THE SAME TIME FREE FROM THE LAW SIN DEATH THE POWER OF THE DEVIL HELL ETC
I MYSELF WAS AT ONE TIME ENTANGLED IN THIS ERROR
WHAT DO THEY KNOW
CHARITY SUFFERETH LONG AND IS KIND ETC
IF WE MUST LOSE ONE OR THE OTHER LET US LOSE A FRIEND AND BROTHER RATHER THAN GOD OUR FATHER
NOWHERE IN THE BOOK OF JONAH DO YOU READ THAT THE NINEVITES RECEIVED THE LAW OF MOSES OR THAT THEY WERE CIRCUMCISED OR THAT THEY OFFERED SACRIFICES
HOW CAN I BE HOLY WHEN I FEEL MY SINS I ANSWER
FOR I THROUGH THE LAW AM DEAD TO THE LAW THAT I MIGHT LIVE UNTO GOD
PAUL IS AN EXPERT AT ALLEGORIES
COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST CHRIST'S BENEFITS ARE SO PRECIOUS THAT HE WILL DISPENSE THEM ONLY TO THOSE WHO NEED THEM AND REALLY DESIRE THEM
LET HIM STEP FORWARD AND WE WILL PRAISE HIM
ONLY IT IS NOT ABLE TO JUSTIFY US
THE RIGHT SPIRIT IN PAUL SUPPLIES HIM WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY FACILITY IN HANDLING THE AFFLICTED CONSCIENCES OF THE FALLEN
THE LAW WAS GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE PROMISE WAS MADE TO ABRAHAM
THE GENTILES WHO HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO FAITH IN CHRIST ATE MEATS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAW
HE HAD ALSO SANCTIFIED YOU TO BRING FORTH THE FRUITS OF FAITH
PAUL HAD CIRCUMCISED TIMOTHY
TO DIE UNTO THE LAW IS TO LIVE UNTO GOD
THEY CANNOT SAVE ME
WITH THE PERMISSION OF SARAH ABRAHAM TOOK HAGAR SARAH'S BONDWOMAN TO WIFE
THEY HEARD HIS SERMONS
WHAT GOOD ARE ALL THE MASSES AND CANONICAL HOURS THAT WE READ
SIN DEATH THE WRATH OF GOD HELL THE DEVIL ARE MORTIFIED IN CHRIST
FOR THIS REASON WAS HE MADE THE LAW OF THE LAW THE SIN OF SIN THE DEATH OF DEATH THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM ME FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW
BUT A CHRISTIAN IS DEAD TO THE LAW
TO FALL AWAY FROM THE GOSPEL IS AN EASY MATTER BECAUSE FEW PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT AN EXCELLENT TREASURE THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST REALLY IS
HAS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT THE POPE CARDINALS BISHOPS MONKS AND THAT THE WHOLE SYNAGOGUE OF SATAN ARE TROUBLE-MAKERS
MISTER LAW LAY OFF HIM
O LORD AT THY COMMANDMENT HAVE I LED FORTH THIS PEOPLE
LET NOT GOD SPEAK WITH US LEST WE DIE CRIED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
LET IT BE DIVINE AND HOLY
A CHRISTIAN MAY PERHAPS NOT FALL INTO THE GROSS SINS OF MURDER ADULTERY THEFT BUT HE IS NOT FREE FROM IMPATIENCE COMPLAINTS HATREDS AND BLASPHEMY OF GOD
WHEN IT PLEASED GOD
THEY EXPECT YOU TO RECIPROCATE
WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT DAVID WAS A MAN OF FAITH WHOSE HEART TRUSTED IN THE LORD WE SHALL UNDERSTAND WHY HE COULD DO SUCH HEROIC DEEDS
WE CONFESS CHRIST AND OUR CONSCIENCE APPROVES OF IT
AT ANY RATE OUR OPPONENTS CANNOT ACCUSE US OF ADULTERY MURDER THEFT AND SUCH CRIMES
IN CONTRAST TO THE DOTING DREAMS OF THE SCHOLASTICS WE TEACH THIS
MY JOB WAS TO BRING YOU THE GOSPEL
THIS IS PAUL'S ALLEGORY
HE HAD REBUKED THEM
IT GRIEVES THE APOSTLE TO THINK THAT HE MIGHT HAVE PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO THE GALATIANS IN VAIN
WE SHALL UNDERSTAND WHY A CHRISTIAN OBSERVES LAWS
EVEN WE HAVE BELIEVED IN JESUS CHRIST THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED
FOR HE THAT SOWETH TO HIS FLESH SHALL OF THE FLESH REAP CORRUPTION
THEY BREAK THE VERY FIRST COMMANDMENT OF GOD BY DENYING HIS PROMISE IN CHRIST
I AM NOT ANGRY WITH YOU SAYS PAUL
HE LOVED ME AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME
BUT THIS IS OUR COMFORT AND OUR GLORY THAT BEING CALLED OF GOD WE HAVE THE PROMISE OF EVERLASTING LIFE
HOWEVER MANY DID THINK THAT PAUL HAD PREACHED THE GOSPEL IN VAIN BECAUSE HE KEPT THE GENTILES FREE FROM THE YOKE OF THE LAW
THE PROVERB HAS IT THAT HUNGER IS THE BEST COOK
EX
HE PERFORMS THE NATURAL FUNCTIONS OF THE FLESH
AS LONG AS WE EXPERIENCE SUCH PERSECUTIONS WE KNOW ALL IS WELL WITH THE GOSPEL
19:8 THIS FEELING OF HOLINESS WAS HEIGHTENED WHEN MOSES ORDERED THEM TO WASH THEIR CLOTHES TO REFRAIN FROM THEIR WIVES AND TO PREPARE THEMSELVES ALL AROUND
IN ROMANS 4:14 THE APOSTLE WRITES
PAUL ALONE STOOD UP FOR THE TRUTH FOR BARNABAS HIS COMPANION WAS LOST TO HIM AND PETER WAS AGAINST HIM
IF IT IS TOO GENTLE IT WILL NOT CORRECT CONDITIONS
HE FOUND IN ME NO RIGHT MIND AND NO GOOD WILL
FROM NOW ON I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MORE VOWS
BY FAITH ABEL OFFERED UNTO GOD A MORE EXCELLENT SACRIFICE IN OUR DEALINGS WITH GOD THE WORK IS WORTH NOTHING WITHOUT FAITH FOR WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM HEBREWS 11:6 THE SACRIFICE OF ABEL WAS BETTER THAN THE SACRIFICE OF CAIN BECAUSE ABEL HAD FAITH
BUT IT NO LONGER EXISTS FOR ME
HE HATES OUR FAITH
THEY AVOID THE CROSS
BUT WHY DON'T YOU MOUNT UP TO HEAVEN
WE ARE MADE AS THE FILTH OF THE WORLD AND ARE THE OFFSCOURING OF ALL THINGS UNTO THIS DAY I COR
ONCE A PERSON HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST HE WILL NOT BE UNPRODUCTIVE OF GOOD BUT AS A GOOD TREE HE WILL BRING FORTH GOOD FRUIT
YOU GALATIANS DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT CIRCUMCISION
WHY DO YOU GET SO WORKED UP OVER CEREMONIES MEATS DAYS PLACES AND SUCH THINGS
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE AMONG THEM WHO KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE
UNBELIEVERS ARE IGNORANT OF THIS HAPPY KNOWLEDGE
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE EXEMPT FROM OBEDIENCE TO THE CIVIL LAWS UNDER WHICH WE LIVE
BUT AS SOON AS THE GOSPEL CAME YOUR WAY YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST BY THE SIMPLE HEARING OF FAITH BEFORE YOU EVER HAD A CHANCE TO DO A SINGLE GOOD DEED LUKE VERIFIES THIS STATEMENT OF PAUL IN THE BOOK OF ACTS
NO WONDER THAT OUR DOCTRINE IS CERTIFIED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REST IN OUR OWN STRENGTH OUR OWN CONSCIENCE OUR OWN FEELINGS OUR OWN PERSON OUR OWN WORKS
THE FALSE GOSPEL HAS IT THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH BUT NOT WITHOUT THE DEEDS OF THE LAW
THAT IS NO SIN THEY THINK
ONE OF TWO THINGS HAS TO BE DONE
WHAT SWEET NAMES HE IS CALLING YOU IN HIS LETTER
THEY NOT ONLY EXPECT TO PACIFY CHRIST BY THE STRICTNESS OF THEIR LIFE BUT ALSO EXPECT TO BE REWARDED BY HIM FOR THEIR GOOD DEEDS
TO PARAPHRASE THIS SENTENCE
14:16 HE ALSO BEGGED THE CORINTHIANS TO GIVE NO OFFENSE IN ANYTHING THAT THE MINISTRY BE NOT BLAMED I COR
TRUE THE LAW SAYS
THAT IS ENOUGH TO SET ANY PERSON AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW AND ALL THE TRIMMINGS OF MEN'S OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS THE ORDERS OF MONKS AND FRIARS AND THEIR SUPERSTITIONS
HERE PAUL RELATES THAT IMMEDIATELY UPON BEING CALLED BY GOD TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE GENTILES HE WENT INTO ARABIA WITHOUT CONSULTING A SINGLE PERSON
YOU HAVE SUFFERED THE LOSS OF YOUR POSSESSIONS YOU HAVE BORNE REPROACHES YOU HAVE PASSED THROUGH MANY DANGERS OF BODY AND LIFE
AND THIS IS THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOMETH THE WORLD EVEN OUR FAITH I JOHN 5:4 YOU MAY NOW PERCEIVE WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BELIEVE AND CONFESS THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST
NOW IF I COULD PERFORM ANY WORK ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND DESERVING OF GRACE AND ONCE HAVING OBTAINED GRACE MY GOOD WORKS WOULD CONTINUE TO EARN FOR ME THE RIGHT AND REWARD OF ETERNAL LIFE WHY SHOULD I STAND IN NEED OF THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE SUFFERING AND DEATH OF CHRIST
WHEN THEY HAVE WON THE PRAISE OF MEN PRIDE LEADS THEM ON TO BELITTLE THE WORK OF OTHER MEN AND TO APPLAUD THEIR OWN
VERSE 25
VERSE 25
WE WERE OPPRESSED AND CONDEMNED BY THE LAW
AS LONG AS I ABIDE IN CHRIST NOTHING CAN HURT ME
IF THIS ERROR HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO PASS UNCHALLENGED CHRIST WOULD HAVE LOST OUT ALTOGETHER
WITHOUT CHRIST THERE IS NO ACCESS TO THE FATHER BUT FUTILE RAMBLING
THEY HAVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT AND WITHOUT HIM NOBODY CAN KEEP THE LAW WHERE THE HOLY GHOST DOES NOT DWELL IN MEN THERE DWELLS AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT A SPIRIT THAT DESPISES GOD AND TURNS EVERY EFFORT AT KEEPING THE LAW INTO A DOUBLE SIN
YOU WOULD NOT THINK OF BREAKING FAITH WITH A MAN'S TESTAMENT
YOU TROUBLE ME WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF MY PAST SINS
IT IS THE DEDUCTION RATHER THAN THE FACT WHICH PAUL REPROVES
NO ONLY UNTIL THE PROMISE SHOULD BE FULFILLED
SOME HAVE CLAIMED THAT THE SAINTS ARE WITHOUT INFIRMITIES
THE GOSPEL OF THE FREE FORGIVENESS OF SINS THROUGH CHRIST WILL NEVER APPEAL TO THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS
YES WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER THEM MORE THAN WE SHOULD
DRUNKENNESS GLUTTONY PAUL DOES NOT SAY THAT EATING AND DRINKING ARE WORKS OF THE FLESH BUT INTEMPERANCE IN EATING AND DRINKING WHICH IS A COMMON VICE NOWADAYS IS A WORK OF THE FLESH
JOHN 14:12 THE TRUE PURPOSE OF CHRIST'S COMING WAS THE ABOLITION OF THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH
HE THEREFORE GOES TO CHRIST TO FIND PERFECT RIGHTEOUSNESS
CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE CONFIDENCE OF THE HEART IN GOD THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
THEY DO NOT FEAR OR LOVE GOD AS THEY SHOULD
THE APOSTLE STATED BEFORE THAT THE SCRIPTURE HATH CONCLUDED ALL UNDER SIN FOREVER
FAITH PERMEATES ALL THE DEEDS OF THE BELIEVER AS CHRIST'S DIVINITY PERMEATED HIS HUMANITY
ON THE OTHER HAND SARAH THE FREE CHURCH SEEMS BARREN
THE OTHER APOSTLES DO NOT SPEAK SO SLIGHTINGLY OF THE LAW
THEY SHOULD NOT BE QUARRELERS OR DRUNKARDS
THE EFFECT IS THE SAME AS IF THEY SAID I AM CHRIST
HE DID NOT RESIGN HIS OFFICE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE GOSPEL HE PREACHED WAS THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION TO EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVES
TO WITHSTAND HIS CONTINUED ASSAULTS WE MUST BE LONGSUFFERING AND PATIENTLY WAIT FOR THE DEVIL TO GET TIRED OF HIS GAME
FAITH AND HOPE MUST CONTINUE
WE IN TURN HATE AND CONDEMN THEIR CURSED DOCTRINE
THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO OFFENDED AT THE LAW BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT LOOK AT THE BARE FACE OF MOSES
DID CHRIST DIE OR DID HE NOT DIE
LET THEM FLOW FROM A CHEERFUL HEART BECAUSE YOU HAVE REMISSION OF SIN IN CHRIST WHEN CROSSES AND AFFLICTIONS COME OUR WAY WE BEAR THEM PATIENTLY
BECAUSE GOD SAW THAT WE COULD NOT FULFILL THE LAW HE PROVIDED A WAY OF SALVATION LONG BEFORE THE LAW WAS EVER GIVEN A SALVATION THAT HE PROMISED TO ABRAHAM SAYING IN THEE SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED THE VERY FIRST THING FOR US TO DO IS TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST
OVER AGAINST THE DEVIL AND HIS MISSIONARIES THE AUTHORS OF FALSE DOCTRINES AND SECTS WE OUGHT TO BE LIKE THE APOSTLE IMPATIENT AND RIGOROUSLY CONDEMNATORY AS PARENTS ARE WITH THE DOG THAT BITES THEIR LITTLE ONE BUT THE WEEPING CHILD ITSELF THEY SOOTHE
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE BOLDLY
BUT PRAISEWORTHY OR NOT SUCH VIRTUES DO NOT ACQUIT US BEFORE GOD
IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFLICT WHEN WE SHOULD BE CONSOLING OURSELVES WITH THE GOSPEL THE LAW REARS UP AND BEGINS TO RAGE ALL OVER OUR CONSCIENCE
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO APPROACH YOU BY LETTER IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT HE LEAVES NO STONE UNTURNED IN HIS EFFORT TO RECALL THEM TO THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST HE CHIDES ENTREATS PRAISES AND BLAMES THE GALATIANS TRYING EVERY WAY TO HIT THE RIGHT NOTE AND TONE OF VOICE
THEY SO EASILY TEND TO ERROR IN WORKS
TO JUSTIFY HIS USURPED PRIMACY IN THE CHURCH THE POPE CLAIMS THAT PETER WAS THE CHIEF OF THE APOSTLES
THIS IS HEBREW PHRASEOLOGY ALSO USED BY PAUL IN II CORINTHIANS CHAPTER 3
PAUL HAS NOTHING AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH AND THEREFORE ARE TRUE DOERS OF THE LAW
FOR THIS IS ANTICHRIST'S DOCTRINE
BEFORE THE LAW COMES TO ME I FEEL NO SIN
FOR DO I NOW PERSUADE MEN OR GOD
EVEN THE SAINTS SIN AS THEY THEMSELVES CONFESS IN THE LORD'S PRAYER AND IN THE CREED
THE OBSERVANCE OF DAYS AND MONTHS AND TIMES AND YEARS
TO SKIP THE LEAST REQUIREMENT OF THEIR ORDER WOULD BE A CRIME OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE
BARNABAS INTRODUCED PAUL TO THE APOSTLES AND RELATED TO THEM HOW PAUL HAD MET THE LORD JESUS ON THE WAY TO DAMASCUS ALSO HOW PAUL HAD PREACHED BOLDLY AT DAMASCUS IN THE NAME OF JESUS
BY NATURE WE ARE CLAD IN THE GARB OF ADAM
BUT WHY
IF HE SAW THAT THEY WERE STUBBORN HE COULD SPEAK TO THEM MORE EARNESTLY
THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE FREE IF THEY HAD CALLED CHRIST TO THEIR AID
LET NOT THEN YOUR GOOD BE EVIL SPOKEN OF ROM
FOR IT IS WRITTEN CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT HANGETH ON A TREE
WHY DO THE FALSE APOSTLES INSIST THAT YOU SHOULD BE CIRCUMCISED
WITCHCRAFT IS A BRAND OF IDOLATRY
HE THROWS IT IN FOR GOOD MEASURE
HERE SOMEONE MAY OBJECT
WITH THESE WORDS THE APOSTLE INTENDS TO DRAW THE GALATIANS ON
IN OTHER WORDS THE LAW HAD TO BE MADE TOLERABLE TO THE PEOPLE
THESE MINISTERS DESERT OUR POOR AND MALIGNED CHRIST INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD SEEK ADVANTAGES FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT FOR CHRIST
THE DOCTRINE THEY BRING CAUSES YOUR CONSCIENCE ONLY TROUBLE THE CLAUSE WHOSOEVER HE BE SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES IN OUTWARD APPEARANCE AT LEAST WERE VERY GOOD AND DEVOUT MEN
WHY DO OUR OPPONENTS NOT PROFESS THE SAME TRUTH IN SPIRITUAL MATTERS
THE GOSPEL ANNOUNCES THAT CHRIST IS COME TO FORGIVE THE SINS OF THE WORLD
HAVE YE SUFFERED SO MANY THINGS IN VAIN PAUL WANTS TO SAY
NOW WHOM OUGHT YOU TO BELIEVE
I TESTIFY HE SAYS I SWEAR BY THE LIVING GOD PAUL'S STATEMENT MAY BE EXPLAINED NEGATIVELY TO MEAN
WE OBEY UNDER DURESS AND WE DO IT RESENTFULLY
HOW CAN I BUY FOR A PENNY WHAT COST A MILLION DOLLARS
AS THE OPPONENTS OF PAUL SO OUR OWN ADVERSARIES LUTHER'S THE ENEMIES OF THE REFORMATION CONTEND THAT THE TRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS DARE NOT BE NEGLECTED WITHOUT LOSS OF SALVATION
WHOEVER GOES BACK TO THE LAW LOSES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH FAILS IN THE RECOGNITION OF HIS SINFULNESS DOES NOT KNOW GOD NOR THE DEVIL NOR HIMSELF AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF THE LAW
SATAN WILL CIRCUMVENT THE GOSPEL AND EXPLAIN CHRIST IN THIS HIS OWN DIABOLICAL WAY
THUS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LAW IS TANTAMOUNT TO DECLARING THAT CHRIST IS NOT YET COME
FOR ALL THAT HE WAS JUSTIFIED AND RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
BUT IF WE ASCRIBE TO THE LAW FUNCTIONS FOR WHICH IT WAS NEVER INTENDED WE PERVERT NOT ONLY THE LAW BUT ALSO THE GOSPEL
WE MAY LIVE IN JOY AND SAFETY UNDER CHRIST
THE GOSPEL IS NOT THERE FOR US TO AGGRANDIZE OURSELVES
AS WE HAVE THEREFORE OPPORTUNITY LET US DO GOOD UNTO ALL MEN ESPECIALLY UNTO THEM WHO ARE OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH
NO DOUBT HE FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FAULT
WE HEARD HIM PREACH
18:5 BUT NOW COMES THE GOSPEL AND SAYS
THEREFORE I WILL NOT HAVE YOU FOR MY TEACHER O SATAN VERSE 9
ONE THING IS CERTAIN ABRAHAM WAS NEVER JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE LAW WAS NOT IN HIS DAY
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER LAW THE LAW OF GRACE AND LIBERTY WHICH CONDEMNS THE ACCUSING LAW OF MOSES ON FIRST SIGHT PAUL SEEMS TO BE ADVANCING A STRANGE AND UGLY HERESY
THEY DO NOT WORSHIP GOD IN FAITH
THEREFORE HE ADDED TO HIS PROMISES SOMETHING BETTER THE LAW
THEIR OBJECTION TO PAUL'S GOSPEL IS IDENTICAL TO THAT RECORDED IN THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF ACTS TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE GALATIANS TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST OR TO BE BAPTIZED BUT THAT IT WAS NEEDFUL TO CIRCUMCISE THEM AND TO COMMAND THEM TO KEEP THE LAW OF MOSES FOR EXCEPT YE BE CIRCUMCISED AFTER THE MANNER OF MOSES YE CANNOT BE SAVED AS THOUGH CHRIST WERE A WORKMAN WHO HAD BEGUN A BUILDING AND LEFT IT FOR MOSES TO FINISH
ST JEROME AND OTHERS OF THE ANCIENT FATHERS ALLEGE THIS INFIRMITY OF PAUL'S TO HAVE BEEN SOME PHYSICAL DEFECT OR CONCUPISCENCE
THEY DENY CHRIST AND ALL HIS BENEFITS
AS CHILDREN OF THE LAW WE WERE TREATED LIKE SERVANTS AND PRISONERS
THE GOSPEL DOES NOT THREATEN
OUR OPPONENTS REFUSE TO MAKE THIS DISTINCTION
HE COULD NOT HAVE UTTERED ANYTHING MORE DEVASTATING TO THE PRESTIGE OF THE LAW
MY LITTLE CHILDREN OF WHOM I TRAVAIL IN BIRTH AGAIN UNTIL CHRIST BE FORMED IN YOU
BELIEVE IN CHRIST AND YOUR SINS WILL BE PARDONED
IF WE ARE WITHOUT THE LAW WE MAY AS WELL INDULGE OURSELVES
THIS UNITY IS NOT DISTURBED BY OUTWARD DIFFERENCES OF STATION OR OF OCCUPATION
WHERE FORMERLY THEY WERE VAINGLORIOUS SPITEFUL AND ENVIOUS THEY NOW BECOME HUMBLE GENTLE AND PATIENT
BUT WE MUST NOT ON THEIR ACCOUNT KEEP SILENT
BUT WHEN THE LAW COMES SIN DEATH AND HELL ARE REVEALED TO ME
I DO NOT MEAN TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE DESPISED
PAUL DISPARAGES THE AUTHORITY AND DIGNITY OF THE TRUE APOSTLES
THINK OF THAT WHEN YOU DO GOOD AND THE INGRATITUDE OF MEN WILL NOT STOP YOU FROM DOING GOOD VERSE 10
BUT BECAUSE WE SEEK THE ADVANTAGE AND HONOR OF CHRIST THEY PERSECUTE US ALL AROUND
I AM DEAF YOU KNOW
BECAUSE THEY ARE SLAVES AND PERSECUTORS OF THE CHILDREN OF THE FREE WOMAN THEY SHALL BE CAST OUT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD FOREVER
THE LAW CONFIRMS THE PROMISES IN THAT IT PREPARES A PERSON TO LOOK FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISES OF GOD IN CHRIST
IT IS EVIDENT THAT ISHMAEL WAS THE SON OF ABRAHAM AFTER THE FLESH AND NOT AFTER THE PROMISE
NONE OF THEM SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS PASSAGE FROM SOLOMON
PAUL PURPOSELY SPEAKS THAT WAY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PORTION OF OUR COMFORT
THE TROUBLE WITH THE MINISTERS OF SATAN IS THAT THEY LOOK UPON THE MINISTRY AS A STEPPING-STONE TO FAME AND GLORY AND RIGHT THERE YOU HAVE THE SEED FOR ALL SORTS OF DISSENSIONS
HOWEVER GREAT THESE SINS WERE THEY WERE NOT COMMITTED TO SPITE GOD BUT FROM WEAKNESS
I WAS MUCH GIVEN TO FASTING WATCHING PRAYING SAYING OF MASSES AND THE LIKE
THE MINISTER OF DEATH AND THE MINISTER OF LIFE
THE DEVIL GETS PEOPLE INTO ALL KINDS OF SCRAPES
THE ARABIANS CALL MOUNT SINAI AGAR
WHEN YOUR CONSCIENCE GETS INTO TROUBLE SAY TO YOURSELF
BUT THOUGH WE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL UNTO YOU THAN YE HAVE RECEIVED LET HIM BE ACCURSED VERSES 13 14
ALL THE DUTIES OF A CHRISTIAN HUSBAND E.G TO LOVE HIS WIFE TO BRING UP HIS CHILDREN TO GOVERN HIS FAMILY ETC ARE THE VERY FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT
LET US NOT FAIL TO THANK GOD FOR DELIVERING US FROM THE DOCTRINE OF DOUBT
I ASK YOU WHAT SIN CAN BE MORE HORRIBLE THAN TO REJECT THE GRACE OF GOD AND TO REFUSE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST
BUT TO SINNERS WHO LIVE IN A FALSE ASSURANCE CHRIST MUST BE INTRODUCED AS AN EXAMPLE
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT FAITH IS
AS TO CAIN HE HAD NO FAITH OR TRUST IN GOD'S GRACE BUT STRUTTED ABOUT IN HIS OWN FANCIED WORTH
PAUL WE DO NOT PERVERT THE GOSPEL YOU HAVE BROUGHT UNTO US
IN THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE PURPOSE OF THE LAW THE EXPONENTS OF THE LAW ABUSE THE LAW AS PAUL SAYS ROMANS 10:3 FOR THEY BEING IGNORANT OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND GOING ABOUT TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS HAVE NOT SUBMITTED THEMSELVES UNTO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN THEIR FOLLY OUR OPPONENTS RUSH INTO THE SCRIPTURES PICK OUT A SENTENCE HERE AND A SENTENCE THERE ABOUT THE LAW AND IMAGINE THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
BUT AFTER THAT FAITH IS COME WE ARE NO LONGER UNDER A SCHOOLMASTER
THE LORD HATH LAID ON HIM THE INIQUITY OF US ALL WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO MINIMIZE THE FORCE OF THIS DECLARATION
YOU SEE OUR REASON ALWAYS THINKS IT IS TOO EASY AND CHEAP TO HAVE RIGHTEOUSNESS THE HOLY SPIRIT AND LIFE EVERLASTING BY THE MERE HEARING OF THE GOSPEL
GRANTED THAT I HAVE NOT COMMITTED MURDER ADULTERY THEFT AND SIMILAR SINS IN DEED NEVERTHELESS I HAVE COMMITTED THEM IN THE HEART AND THEREFORE I AM A TRANSGRESSOR OF ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD
HE TREATS THE LAW AS IF IT WERE A THIEF AND A ROBBER HE TREATS THE LAW AS CONTEMPTIBLE TO THE CONSCIENCE IN ORDER THAT THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN CHRIST MAY TAKE COURAGE TO DEFY THE LAW AND SAY
21:12 THE HOLY GHOST CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLS THE ADMIRERS OF THE LAW THE CHILDREN OF THE BONDWOMAN
OUR OPPONENTS WILL NOT AGREE WITH US ON ANYTHING
AND SHALL DECEIVE MANY WHOEVER SEEKS RIGHTEOUSNESS BY WORKS DENIES GOD AND MAKES HIMSELF GOD
BECAUSE THE PERSON OF ABEL PLEASED THE LORD THE OFFERING OF ABEL PLEASED THE LORD ALSO
TO THE HONOR OF PETER IT MUST BE SAID THAT HE TOOK THE CORRECTION
TRUE BELIEVERS TOO ARE TEMPTED WITH CARNAL LUST
PAUL WAS FORCED TO SPEAK OF HIS CONVERSION TO COMBAT THE SLANDEROUS CONTENTION OF THE FALSE APOSTLES TO THE EFFECT THAT THIS APOSTLESHIP WAS INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE OTHER APOSTLES
ASK THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE LAW ON MOUNT SINAI WHETHER WHAT THE SCHOLASTICS SAY IS TRUE
HE MAINTAINS THAT THEIR ZEAL IS MERE PRETENSE TO DECEIVE THE GALATIANS
THE READING IS A LITTLE DOUBTFUL
BUT IF YE BITE AND DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER TAKE HEED THAT YE BE NOT CONSUMED ONE OF ANOTHER
FOR WHEN I AM WEAK THEN AM I STRONG AND IN THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE SAME EPISTLE THE APOSTLE WRITES
FOR WE ARE MADE A SPECTACLE UNTO THE WORLD AND TO ANGELS AND TO MEN I COR
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN TO SPECULATE ABOUT THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE POWER WISDOM AND MAJESTY OF GOD WHEN THE CONSCIENCE IS IN TURMOIL OVER SIN
ON THE CONTRARY IT ACCUSES ME IT FRIGHTENS ME IT DRIVES ME CRAZY
WHAT CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US
FOR IN ISAAC SHALL THY SEED BE CALLED GEN
AS LONG AS AN HEIR IS UNDER AGE HE IS TREATED VERY MUCH LIKE A SERVANT
EVEN THE CEREMONIES PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW FORESHADOWED CHRIST
TO AVOID THE CURSE WE MUST HOLD ON TO THE PROMISE OF THE BLESSING IN CHRIST
WHEN YOU READ HOW THE FATHERS PROPHETS AND KINGS ACCOMPLISHED GREAT DEEDS REMEMBER TO EXPLAIN THEM AS THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS ACCOUNTS FOR THEM
AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE HAD ALREADY BERATED THEM THE APOSTLE ONCE MORE REPROVES THOSE WHO PROVOKE AND ENVY OTHERS
CHRIST IS LORD OVER THE LAW BECAUSE HE WAS CRUCIFIED UNTO THE LAW
I AM MADE TO APPEAR AS IF I AM SPEAKING FOR MY OWN BENEFIT
I DO MY LIVING NOW BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD PAUL HAD THE SAME VOICE THE SAME TONGUE BEFORE AND AFTER HIS CONVERSION
THOSE WHO SHARE THE OPINION THAT A PERSON IS JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW ARE SIMPLY BEWITCHED
AS FOR THE SCOFFERS AND SKEPTICS I AM SO DISGUSTED WITH THEM THAT IN ALL MY LIFE I WOULD NOT OPEN MY MOUTH FOR THEM ONCE
AT FIRST WE GERMANS ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC BUT PRESENTLY OUR EMOTIONS COOL AND WE BECOME SLACK
TILL THE SEED SHOULD COME TO WHOM THE PROMISE WAS MADE
I DO NOT OBTAIN ETERNAL LIFE BECAUSE I DO NOT KILL COMMIT ADULTERY STEAL ETC
THEY DEMANDED THAT PAUL BE SHUNNED AS A BLASPHEMER AND A REBEL WHILE THEY WERE TO BE HEARD AS TRUE TEACHERS OF THE GOSPEL AND AUTHENTIC DISCIPLES OF THE APOSTLES
ALL WHO BELIEVE IN HIM ARE DELIVERED FROM LAW SIN AND DEATH
THESE MUST BE INSTRUCTED AS TO WHY GOOD WORKS DO NOT JUSTIFY AND FROM WHAT MOTIVES GOOD WORKS MUST BE DONE
OUR OPPONENTS BLAME OUR DOCTRINE FOR THE PRESENT TURMOIL
AMONG THE JEWS PAUL ALLOWED LAW AND CIRCUMCISION TO STAND FOR THE TIME BEING
THE TRUE SAINTS ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE DEATH OF CHRIST
O GRAVE I WILL BE THY DESTRUCTION HOSEA 13:14
THEY BEWITCH AND DECEIVE THEMSELVES
BEFORE VERY LONG THEY ARE GOING TO SUFFER FOR THEIR INGRATITUDE
ON THE CONTRARY WE UPHOLD THE LAW
AS LONG AS WE CLING TO HIM WE ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT AND ARE FREE FROM THE LAW
WITHOUT SUCH BEARING AND FORBEARING GIVING AND FORGIVING THERE CAN BE NO UNITY BECAUSE TO GIVE AND TO TAKE OFFENSE ARE UNAVOIDABLY HUMAN
THE POWER OF SIN AND DEATH COULD BE BROKEN ONLY BY A GREATER POWER
CAN THE LAD THEN GO AROUND AND SAY THAT HE DESERVED THE INHERITANCE BY HIS OBEDIENCE TO THE OLD MAN'S REQUEST
THE RIGHT HANDS OF FELLOWSHIP
PAUL REPROVED PETER FOR NO TRIFLE BUT FOR THE CHIEF ARTICLE OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE WHICH PETER'S HYPOCRISY HAD ENDANGERED
NO FOR I FLY TO CHRIST WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR MY SINS
BUT WE OFFEND GOD THEREFORE WE NEED A MEDIATOR
ONLY BY PRESERVING OUR LIBERTY SHALL WE BE ABLE TO RETAIN THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL INVIOLATE
MEATS MAY BE REFUSED FOR TWO REASONS
HE CAN TALK
IT WAS AFTER ABRAHAM WAS ACCOUNTED RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH THAT THE SCRIPTURES FIRST MAKE MENTION OF CIRCUMCISION
LET US BEAR THE CROSS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
HE TAKES GOOD CARE OF HIS FAMILY AND IS KIND AND HELPFUL TO OTHERS
BUT PAUL WAS ESPECIALLY CALLED THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES
IF THEY COULD NOT HEAR THE LAW HOW COULD THEY EVER HOPE TO PERFORM THE LAW
ALL BELIEVERS EXPERIENCE THIS DIFFICULTY
WE DID NOT ATTACK THEM DIRECTLY
HE COULD CHANGE HIS VOICE ACCORDING TO THEIR ATTITUDE
THE APOSTLES CHOSE TWO CANDIDATES AND THEN CAST LOTS PRAYING THAT GOD WOULD INDICATE WHICH ONE HE WOULD HAVE
FOR HE SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITIES ISAIAH 53:11 THE APOSTLE FRANKLY EXPRESSES HIS SURPRISE TO THE GALATIANS THAT THEY WHO HAD KNOWN GOD INTIMATELY THROUGH THE GOSPEL SHOULD SO EASILY BE PERSUADED BY THE FALSE APOSTLES TO RETURN TO THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE LAW
WE PREACHED NOT CIRCUMCISION WE DID NOT REQUIRE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
ONLY THEY WOULD THAT WE SHOULD REMEMBER THE POOR
NO RELIGION PLEASES ME WHEREBY THE FATHER IS NOT GLORIFIED THROUGH HIS SON JESUS
YOUR CONSCIENCE BELONGS TO CHRIST
OF ALL THE DISEASED AND VICIOUS DOCTRINES OF THE PAPACY THE WORST IS THIS
NOT AS IF THE CONSCIENCE IS NOW INSENSITIVE TO THE TERRORS OF THE LAW BUT THE LAW CANNOT DRIVE THE CONSCIENCE TO DESPAIR
I AM CRUCIFIED UNTO THE WORLD MEANS THAT THE WORLD IN TURN CONDEMNS ME
AS FOR US WE ARE OBLIGED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL WHICH OFFERS TO ALL MEN LIBERTY FROM THE LAW SIN DEATH AND GOD'S WRATH
WOULD TO GOD WE COULD IMPREGNATE OUR HEARTS WITH THESE TRUTHS
IF THE LAW CANNOT BE FULFILLED BY THE BELIEVERS IF SIN CONTINUES TO CLING TO THEM DESPITE THEIR LOVE FOR GOD WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT YET JUSTIFIED BY FAITH WHO ARE STILL ENEMIES OF GOD AND HIS WORD LIKE THE UNBELIEVING LAW-WORKERS
FOR CHRIST ON WHOM OUR EYES ARE FIXED IN WHOM WE LIVE WHO LIVES IN US IS LORD OVER LAW SIN DEATH AND ALL EVIL
FIRST APOSTLES
IT DOES NOT STIR UP TROUBLE
IT WILL TAKE ME TO CHRIST EVERY TIME
I LEARNED NOTHING NEITHER DID I DEFEND MY CAUSE
I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY WHEN WE PAY ATTENTION TO REASON GOD SEEMS TO PROPOSE IMPOSSIBLE MATTERS IN THE CHRISTIAN CREED
MEN SET LITTLE VALUE UPON THAT WHICH THEY HAVE AND COVET WHAT THEY HAVE NOT AS THE POET SAYS
WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL FIRST CAME TO US MANY WERE ZEALOUS HEARD SERMONS GREEDILY AND HELD THE MINISTRY OF GOD'S WORD IN HIGH ESTEEM
THE LAW HAS ITS PLACE AND ITS OWN GOOD TIME
THEY DENY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD HIS MERCY AND HIS PROMISES
SO LONG AS HE SITS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD TO INTERCEDE FOR US WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE ANGER OF GOD
THIS NATURAL BUT ENTIRELY WRONG REACTION TO THE LAW HAS BRED THE MANY CEREMONIES AND WORKS DEVISED TO EARN GRACE AND REMISSION OF SINS
AFTER ALL THEY HAD RECEIVED THE LAW FROM GOD
I HAVE THE SAME POWER
WE OBTAIN THEM NOT AS AGENTS BUT AS BENEFICIARIES
NEXT TO THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL A TRUE AND FAITHFUL PASTOR WILL TAKE CARE OF THE POOR
THESE JEWISH-CHRISTIAN FANATICS WHO PUSHED THEMSELVES INTO THE GALATIAN CHURCHES AFTER PAUL'S DEPARTURE BOASTED THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM TRUE MINISTERS OF CHRIST HAVING BEEN TRAINED BY THE APOSTLES THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO PERFORM MIRACLES
IT TAKES THE GOSPEL AND THE PREACHING OF FAITH IN CHRIST TO RAISE AND SAVE A PERSON
WAKE UP AND BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST THE CONQUEROR OF LAW AND SIN
THE LAW CANNOT CONDEMN THEM ALTHOUGH THEY FEEL SIN AND CONFESS IT
TODAY THE ANABAPTISTS AND OTHERS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CONDEMN US ACCUSE US LUTHERANS OF TIMIDITY IN PROFESSING THE WHOLE TRUTH
THIS WAY HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM BY LETTER
THE CURSE MEANT TO CONDEMN GOD'S MERCY
THE SENTENCE MAY BE CONSTRUED TO READ
HE EXPRESSLY SAYS
NOW WE BRETHREN AS ISAAC WAS ARE THE CHILDREN OF PROMISE
IF HE OFFERS HIS GIFTS FREE OF CHARGE WHY NOT TAKE THEM
THEY NEEDED THESE SAVING ORDINANCES JUST AS MUCH AS WE DO
WE ARE NOT YET PERFECTLY RIGHTEOUS
THOU SHALT NOT RESPECT THE PERSON OF THE POOR NOR HONOR THE PERSON OF THE MIGHTY LEV
WE HAVE HERE AN EXAMPLE OF BAD TRAITS THAT OFTEN CLING TO INDIVIDUAL CHRISTIANS AND ENTIRE CONGREGATIONS
A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE APOSTLE HAD CONDEMNED THOSE WHO ARE ENVIOUS AND START HERESIES AND SCHISMS
THEY TAUGHT CIRCUMCISION TO AVOID THE HATRED AND PERSECUTION OF MEN
WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY TEACH ME SINCE CHRIST BY HIS REVELATION HAD TAUGHT ME ALL THINGS
WITH THESE WORDS PAUL REFUTES ANOTHER ARGUMENT OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
HE DID NOT CONCEAL HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THEIR LACK OF STABILITY
IT FIGHTS AGAINST TRIBULATIONS THE CROSS DESPONDENCY DESPAIR AND WAITS FOR BETTER THINGS TO COME IN THE MIDST OF EVIL
THE RESULT WAS THAT THE PEOPLE WERE UP IN ARMS AGAINST PAUL AND HIS DOCTRINE
THE DEFECT LIES IN OUR LACK OF FAITH
GOD IS LONGSUFFERING AND FULL OF MERCY
BUT THERE BE SOME THAT TROUBLE YOU
THAT THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL MIGHT CONTINUE WITH YOU
IT MUST BE REVEALED TO THEM
BUT WE WILL NOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ANCHORAGE OF OUR SALVATION
BUT THIS IS A PERVERSION OF THE WORDS OF HOLY WRIT
IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE LAW DIFFERS FROM THE GOSPEL IN ANOTHER RESPECT IN RESPECT TO AUTHORSHIP
I HAVE NO REASON TO WISH YOU ILL
IN THE APOSTOLIC CREED WE CONFESS
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE EXAMPLE OF THE GALATIAN CHURCHES I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD RECEIVED THE WORD OF GOD WITH SUCH EAGERNESS AS THEY HAD COULD SO QUICKLY LET GO OF IT
THIS PASSAGE DOES NOT CONTAIN DOCTRINE
WITHOUT CHRIST ALL RELIGION IS IDOLATRY
ROME DOES ADMIT AFTER ALL THAT WORKS IN THEMSELVES DO NOT JUSTIFY UNLESS THEY ISSUE FROM A SINCERE HEART
THIRSTY SOULS ARE WHAT CHRIST WANTS
IN THE MEANWHILE THEY HARBORED WITHIN THEIR BREASTS PRIDE HATRED DISDAIN SELF-TRUST CONTEMPT OF THE WORD OF GOD DISLOYALTY BLASPHEMY AND OTHER LUSTS OF THE FLESH
TEACHING THE LAW AND PERFORMING MIRACLES DID NOT CONSTITUTE HIS UNIQUE MISSION TO THE WORLD
THIS SENTENCE STANDS FOREVER
MISTER LAW YOU ARE NOT THE WHOLE SHOW
FORGIVENESS OF SINS DELIVERANCE FROM DEATH THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST EVERLASTING LIFE ARE GRAND THINGS
WAS IT NECESSARY FOR PAUL TO GO UNDER OATH
SECONDLY BECAUSE THOU HAST PURCHASED HEAVEN FOR ME BY THY SUFFERING AND DEATH
HE IS WITHOUT SIN AND THE LAW CANNOT ACCUSE HIM
THE MORE DESERVING A PERSON IS THE LESS HE IS APPRECIATED
IN THIS ARTFUL MANNER THEY HOODWINK THE PEOPLE WHO RATHER ENJOY TO SEE THEIR FORMER PASTORS TAKEN DOWN A FEW NOTCHES BY SUCH UPSTARTS
SHOULD HE DESPAIR
AMEN
AMEN
AMEN
AND I WILL SMITE THEE AND TAKE THINE HEAD FROM THEE I SAMUEL 17:37 45 46 BEFORE DAVID COULD ACHIEVE A SINGLE HEROIC DEED HE WAS ALREADY A MAN BELOVED OF GOD STRONG AND CONSTANT IN FAITH
IF GRACE ABOUNDS WHERE SIN ABOUNDS LET US ABOUND IN SIN THAT GRACE MAY ALL THE MORE ABOUND PEOPLE WHO REASON THUS ARE RECKLESS
PAUL BESEECHES THE GALATIANS TO LOOK UPON HIS CORRECTION AS A SIGN THAT HE REALLY CARED FOR THEM
HOW CAN THE ONE STATEMENT PROVE THE OTHER
AND HERE LET US NOTE BY THE WAY THAT TRUE DOCTRINE ALWAYS PRODUCES CONCORD
NEVERTHELESS AFTERWARD IT YIELDETH THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS UNTO THEM WHICH ARE EXERCISED THEREBY HEB
WITH THIS OUR EPISTLE WE ENDEAVOR TO UNDO THE DAMAGE WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES HAVE INFLICTED UPON YOU LIKE PAUL WE STRUGGLE WITH THE WORD OF GOD AGAINST THE FANATICAL ANABAPTISTS OF OUR DAY
MARK WHAT THE APOSTLE IS SAYING
THE CONTROVERSY WAS NOT ABOUT THE GLORY OF PAUL BUT THE GLORY OF GOD THE WORD OF GOD THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD TRUE RELIGION AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH
THAT MEANS
WE SAY OUR SINS WERE TAKEN AWAY BY THE DEATH OF CHRIST FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO LONG BEFORE THERE WERE ANY RELIGIOUS ORDERS CANONS OR RULES OF PENANCE MERITS ETC
ALL THE CHURCHES EVERYWHERE EVEN THOSE OF JUDEA COULD TESTIFY THAT HE HAD PREACHED THE SAME FAITH EVERYWHERE
THEY DON'T LIKE IT
MOSES WAS SUCH A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OFFENDED AT THE LAW
THE WHOLE WORLD IS BLESSED IF IT BELIEVES AS ABRAHAM BELIEVED
IT SAYS THAT A TRANSGRESSOR SHOULD BE HANGED
NOW I WILL ALSO TEACH YOU WHAT TRULY GOOD WORKS ARE
HE KNOWS THAT IT IS THE VICTORY WHICH OVERCOMETH HIM AND THE WORLD
OTHERS TAKE IT TO MEAN GOD'S PRESENT ANGER
TRANSLATED IT MEANS THAT HE IS MY RIGHTEOUSNESS MY LIFE MY EVERLASTING SALVATION
THIRDLY ONCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED A REPUTATION FOR THEMSELVES THEY BECOME SO CHESTY THAT THEY STOP SHORT OF NOTHING
WHICH THINGS ARE AN ALLEGORY
IF WE CAN OVERLOOK OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND WRONG-DOINGS WE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK THE SHORTCOMINGS OF OTHERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WORDS BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS THOSE WHO FAIL TO DO SO EXPOSE THEIR LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW OF CHRIST
THE FIRST DUTY OF MAN IS TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND TO HONOR HIM WITH HIS FAITH
OFTEN OUR LIVES SEEM TO CREEP RATHER THAN TO RUN
THIS IS THEN OUR GENERAL CONCLUSION
THE LAW OUGHT TO BE HONORED
A MEDIATOR SAYS PAUL IS NOT A MEDIATOR OF ONE HE IS NECESSARILY A MEDIATOR OF TWO
AND BECAUSE FAITH HONORS GOD GOD COUNTS FAITH FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
THEY WANT THE TERM TO BLESS TO MEAN TO PRAISE THEY WANT THE PASSAGE TO READ
AND WE ARE TO MAKE USE OF IT IN COMFORTING THE AFFLICTED
THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES WITH THEIR SELF-SUGGESTED WISDOM AND HOLINESS
NEVERTHELESS WHAT SAITH THE SCRIPTURE
GOD IS NOT MOCKED
FOR ME
PEOPLE ASK
WHEN MOSES ADDRESSED THE PEOPLE HE HAD TO COVER HIS FACE WITH THAT VEIL OF HIS
THE LAW IS A MIRROR TO SHOW A PERSON WHAT HE IS LIKE A SINNER WHO IS GUILTY OF DEATH AND WORTHY OF EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT
THEY WERE BOTH THE TRUE SONS OF ABRAHAM WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT ISHMAEL WAS BORN AFTER THE FLESH I.E WITHOUT THE COMMANDMENT AND PROMISE OF GOD WHILE ISAAC WAS BORN ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE
THE FACT IS THE LAW IS CRUCIFIED AND DEAD UNTO US
I HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE MANIFEST
THIS PASSAGE MAY WELL SERVE AS A CRITERION FOR ALL THE RELIGIONS
THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THINE HEART AND WITH ALL THY SOUL AND WITH ALL THY MIGHT DEUT
WHEN THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK OF FAITH IN THE ABSOLUTE OR ABSTRACT FAITH REFERS TO JUSTIFICATION DIRECTLY
HOW CAN THEY TEACH FAITH TO OTHERS
THE MOMENT WE ABASE OURSELVES AND GIVE IN TO THE RAGE OF OUR OPPONENTS PAPISTS AND ANABAPTISTS GROW ARROGANT
THE WORLD WAS PROMISED TO ABRAHAM BECAUSE HE BELIEVED
WE KNOW THAT MORE IS REQUIRED OF THEM TO WHOM MUCH IS GIVEN THAN OF SUCH TO WHOM LITTLE IS GIVEN
PAUL IS QUOTING MOSES
LIE NOT DOWN AND SLEEP BUT STAND UP
HENCE WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
CHRIST'S OFFICE THE APOSTLE DESCRIBES IN THE WORDS
YOU CANNOT CURSE ME ANY MORE DO NOT PERMIT THE LAW TO LIE IN YOUR CONSCIENCE
EVEN AS HE TEACHES GOOD WORKS THE APOSTLE DOES NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION BUT SHOWS AT EVERY TURN THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO BE JUSTIFIED BY WORKS
THE ANABAPTISTS IN OUR TIME IMITATE THE FALSE APOSTLES
LET OTHERS PRAISE CHARITY AND CONCORD TO THE SKIES
PAUL KNEW IT AND THEREFORE HAS HIGH PRAISE FOR THE GALATIANS BECAUSE THEY OVERLOOKED HIS AFFLICTIONS AND RECEIVED HIM LIKE AN ANGEL
I HAVE THE AUTHOR AND LORD OF THE SCRIPTURES ON MY SIDE
WITHOUT FAITH IN CHRIST THE JEW WITH HIS LAWS THE MONK WITH HIS HOLY ORDERS THE GREEK WITH HIS WISDOM THE SERVANT WITH HIS OBEDIENCE SHALL PERISH FOREVER
WHAT YOU RECEIVED FROM ME IS THE GENUINE GOSPEL OF GOD
BEING REVILED WE BLESS
WE DESIRE THAT THEY MAY TURN FROM THEIR EVIL WAYS TO CHRIST AND BE SAVED WITH US
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU DROP THE GOSPEL
SHE IS A SLAVE
WE SAY THAT WE OBTAIN GRACE BY THE FREE MERCY OF GOD ALONE FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
BY WAY OF CONTRAST THEY HOPE TO RISE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE PEOPLE
WE ARE TREATED SHABBILY ON THE OUTSIDE BY TYRANTS ON THE INSIDE BY THOSE WHOM WE HAVE RESTORED TO THE LIBERTY OF THE GOSPEL AND ALSO BY FALSE BRETHREN
IT PLEASED YOU TO KNOW THAT THE FATHER SENT ME INTO THE WORLD
IT IS SO FAINT WE DO NOT KNOW WE ARE GROANING
WHEN THE DOCTRINE OF THE DEVIL IS PREACHED PEOPLE ARE PRODIGAL IN THEIR WILLING SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO DECEIVE THEM
THE FATUOUS IDEA THAT A PERSON CAN BE HOLY BY HIMSELF DENIES GOD THE PLEASURE OF SAVING SINNERS
THE ENMITY OF THE WORLD IN HIS ESTIMATION AUGURS WELL FOR THE SUCCESS AND GROWTH OF THE CHURCH WHICH FARES BEST IN TIMES OF PERSECUTION
SHOULD I BE SO STUPID AS TO REJECT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST WHICH COST ME NOTHING AND SLAVE LIKE A FOOL TO ACHIEVE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW WHICH GOD DISDAINS
AS PAUL SO WE ARE TO DESPISE THE WORLD AND THE DEVIL
FOR IN DUE SEASON WE SHALL REAP IF WE FAINT NOT WAIT FOR THE HARVEST AND THEN YOU WILL REAP THE REWARD OF YOUR SOWING TO THE SPIRIT
A MAN LABORS FOR A DECADE BEFORE HE SUCCEEDS IN TRAINING HIS LITTLE CHURCH INTO ORDERLY RELIGION AND THEN SOME IGNORANT AND VICIOUS POLTROON COMES ALONG TO OVERTHROW IN A MINUTE THE PATIENT LABOR OF YEARS
WHEREFORE THE LAW WAS OUR SCHOOLMASTER TO BRING US UNTO CHRIST
LET EVERYTHING SERVE ITS UNIQUE PURPOSE
ON THE OTHER HAND NOTHING IS MORE PERILOUS THAN TO BE WEARY OF THE WORD OF GOD
CHRIST IS BECOME OF NO EFFECT UNTO YOU WHOSOEVER OF YOU ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
IT MAY BE THAT AMONG THEM WAS SOME OUTSTANDING DISCIPLE OF THE APOSTLES A MAN OF FAME AND AUTHORITY
THE AWFUL SPECTACLE AT MOUNT SINAI PORTRAYED THE PROPER USE OF THE LAW
SO THE DEVIL MASQUERADES ALL HIS DEVICES AND ACTIVITIES
THE ANTICIPATION OF HIS JOY WOULD KILL HIM
BUT THIS IT SHOULD ONLY BE UNTIL FAITH BE REVEALED
WE CAN HEAR HIM SAY
WE CAN HEAR HIM SAY
WE CAN HEAR HIM SAY
THIS FLESH SAYS PAUL IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW THE PAPISTS DO NOT BELIEVE THIS
TO PUT AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE GOSPEL AND THAT OF THE LAW AS THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT
FAITH SUFFERS NOTHING
I AM BAPTIZED
AND HOW ABOUT THE OVERTHROW OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
WHEN PAUL AND BARNABAS RETURNED TO JERUSALEM AND REPORTED WHAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AMONG THE GENTILES THE WHOLE CHURCH WAS ASTONISHED PARTICULARLY WHEN IT HEARD THAT THE UNCIRCUMCISED GENTILES HAD RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST BY THE PREACHING OF FAITH IN CHRIST
THE APOSTLE REPEATS
VERSE 28
VERSE 28
VERSE 28
THE CAUSE WE ARE CALLED TO DEFEND IS NOT PETER'S CAUSE OR THE CAUSE OF OUR PARENTS OR THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THAT OF THE WORLD BUT THE CAUSE OF GOD
THE OPINION THAT OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW WAS MANDATORY UNTO SALVATION WAS GAINING GROUND
BECAUSE THE WORLD IS THE DEVIL'S
CIVIL LAW WHICH IS GOD'S ORDINANCE PROHIBITS TAMPERING WITH ANY TESTAMENT OF MAN
IF IT IS HARSH AND ILL-TIMED IT CAN ALWAYS BE REMODELED
ALTHOUGH THE GALATIANS HAD FALLEN AWAY FROM THE DOCTRINE OF PAUL BAPTISM THE GOSPEL AND THE NAME OF CHRIST CONTINUED AMONG THEM
WHEN HE WAS WITH THE JEWS HOWEVER HE ABSTAINED FROM ALL THINGS FORBIDDEN IN THE LAW FOR HE LABORED TO SERVE ALL MEN THAT HE MIGHT BY ALL MEANS SAVE SOME PAUL DOES NOT REPROVE PETER FOR TRANSGRESSING THE LAW BUT FOR DISGUISING HIS ATTITUDE TO THE LAW
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DANGER THERE IS IN CUSTOMS AND CEREMONIES
GOODNESS A PERSON IS GOOD WHEN HE IS WILLING TO HELP OTHERS IN THEIR NEED
BUT HE WHO WAS OF THE BONDWOMAN WAS BORN AFTER THE FLESH
NOT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS BUT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH MUST BE PROCLAIMED TO THE GENTILES
AT THE SAME TIME PAUL INDICTS THE FALSE APOSTLES
BUT THAT FACT DID NOT JUSTIFY THEM
WHEN THE LAW IS PROPERLY USED ITS VALUE CANNOT BE TOO HIGHLY APPRAISED
NOT ARGUMENTATIVE NOT HATEFUL BUT THOUGHTFUL AND PATIENT
HE IS THE MEDIATOR
WOULD YOU NOT THINK IT PERFECTLY PROPER TO CALL SINAI HAGAR AND JERUSALEM SARAH
TO THIS DAY YOU WILL FIND MANY WHO SEEK TO PLEASE MEN IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY LIVE IN PEACE AND SECURITY
PETER PAUL ALL CHRISTIANS LIVE UP TO THE LAW
ABRAHAM HAD TWO SONS
GOD ALONE COULD BRING RIGHTEOUSNESS LIFE AND MERCY TO LIGHT
THE FIRST PURPOSE OF THE LAW ACCORDINGLY IS TO RESTRAIN THE WICKED
REJOICE AND BE EXCEEDING GLAD MATT
BUT CHRIST'S RIGHTEOUSNESS IS UNCONQUERABLE
MARTIN YOU WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT SIN FOR YOU HAVE FLESH
FOR BEFORE THAT CERTAIN CAME FROM JAMES HE DID EAT WITH THE GENTILES
BUT THESE FANATICS WHO EXCLUDE OUR MEDIATOR IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH GOD DO NOT BELIEVE ME
THE MOHAMMEDAN THINKS HIS KORAN IS THE WILL OF GOD
PEOPLE TELL US
WITHOUT THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION THERE CAN BE ONLY IGNORANCE OF GOD
BEFORE WHOSE EYES JESUS CHRIST HATH BEEN EVIDENTLY SET FORTH
CONSIDERING THYSELF LEST THOU ALSO BE TEMPTED TOWARD THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MISLED WE ARE TO SHOW OURSELVES PARENTALLY AFFECTIONATE SO THAT THEY MAY PERCEIVE THAT WE SEEK NOT THEIR DESTRUCTION BUT THEIR SALVATION
THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH THE LAW IS A STATEMENT OF DEBIT THE GOSPEL A STATEMENT OF CREDIT
THY SERVANT WILL HENCEFORTH OFFER NEITHER BURNT OFFERING NOR SACRIFICE UNTO OTHER GODS BUT UNTO THE LORD
IT PUT UP A FIGHT AGAINST THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION FROM EVERYDAY LIFE HE WRITES TO THE GALATIANS
LET YOUR FAITH SUPPLANT REASON
YOU HAVE CRUCIFIED CHRIST ANEW BECAUSE YOU SEEK SALVATION BY THE LAW TRUE CHRIST CAN NO LONGER BE CRUCIFIED IN PERSON BUT HE IS CRUCIFIED IN US WHEN WE REJECT GRACE FAITH FREE REMISSION OF SINS AND ENDEAVOR TO BE JUSTIFIED BY OUR OWN WORKS OR BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE GRACE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WE SHALL BE SAVED EVEN AS THEY ACTS L5
WHAT IF WE ARE A LITTLE TO BLAME
PAUL ACCENTUATES THE POINT THAT THE GALATIANS HAD BEEN CALLED BY CHRIST UNTO GRACE
SATAN IS CLEVER
CHRISTIANS ARE TO BE PEACEFUL AND QUIET
A MAN'S TESTAMENT SEEMS TOO WEAK A PREMISE FOR THE APOSTLE TO ARGUE FROM IN CONFIRMATION OF SO IMPORTANT A MATTER AS JUSTIFICATION
THEY CANNOT BE STRAIGHTENED OUT IN ANY OTHER WAY
IF YOU EXPERIENCE THE INGRATITUDE OF MEN DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN
TO WHOM WE GAVE PLACE BY SUBJECTION NO NOT FOR AN HOUR
WITH THE MIND I MYSELF SERVE THE LAW OF GOD
BUT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP THE LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE WHICH WE HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS
AFTER AN ABSENCE OF FOURTEEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY EIGHTEEN YEARS PAUL RETURNED TO JERUSALEM TO CONFER WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES
ALL THE SAME TEACHERS ARE INDISPENSABLE OTHERWISE THE CHILDREN WOULD GROW UP WITHOUT DISCIPLINE INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING
OUR OPPONENTS TELL US THAT EVERYTHING WAS AT PEACE BEFORE THE GOSPEL WAS REVIVED BY US
MAKE IT TALK TO YOUR FLESH
THE FALSE APOSTLES WOULD NOT GO TO JERUSALEM OF CAIAPHAS OR TO THE ROME OF THE EMPEROR OR TO ANY OTHER PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD PREACHED BEFORE AS PAUL AND THE OTHER APOSTLES DID
WHAT PAUL MEANS BY SAYING TO THE GALATIANS WHEN YE KNEW NOT GOD IS SIMPLY THIS
BY THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL I HAVE DESTROYED SIN HEAVINESS OF HEART WRATH AND DEATH
LONG AGO THE PROPHETS VISUALIZED THE HAPPY CHANGES CHRIST WOULD EFFECT IN ALL THINGS
WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE MERELY BENEFICIARIES AND RECIPIENTS OF THE TREASURES OF CHRIST
FAITH IS THE BEGINNING OF LIFE BEFORE TRIBULATION
BUT TO MAKE THE DEDUCTION IF YOU EAT YOU SIN
IF WE CAREFULLY WEIGH THE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE WE PERCEIVE THAT HE DOES NOT SPEAK OF DOCTRINAL FAULTS AND ERRORS BUT OF MUCH LESSER FAULTS BY WHICH A PERSON IS OVERTAKEN THROUGH THE WEAKNESS OF HIS FLESH
I WOULD GLADLY HAVE FURNISHED THE WOOD TO BURN HIM
ON THE OTHER HAND SIN IS A MIGHTY TYRANT WHO SUBDUES ALL MEN
THE OFFENDER AND THE OFFENDED
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU EXPECT
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT NEVER DISAPPOINTS US
BUT YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH
WE PAUL DO AGREE WITH YOU IN ALL THINGS
HE HAS HAD ENOUGH
THIS PECULIAR FORM OF SPEECH SOUNDS MUCH SWEETER THAN IF PAUL HAD SAID
THIS GARB PAUL LIKES TO CALL THE OLD MAN BEFORE WE CAN BECOME THE CHILDREN OF GOD THIS OLD MAN MUST BE PUT OFF AS PAUL SAYS EPHESIANS 4:29
PAUL IS SO EAGER TO COME TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF HIS EPISTLE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH IN OPPOSITION TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS THAT ALREADY IN THE TITLE HE MUST SPEAK HIS MIND
IT DEMANDS AND ITS DEMANDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE
AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED THERE WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE ANY LAW
WAIT AND HOPE UNTIL IT WILL BE REVEALED TO YOU IN THE LORD'S OWN TIME
FOR I AM AS YE ARE
FOR I AM AS YE ARE
HOW CAN GOD FULFILL HIS PROMISES TO A PEOPLE THAT HATES THE LAW VERSE 21
HE WILL DO IT NOT BECAUSE WE ARE WORTHY OF SUCH MERCY
THE PAPISTS SAY THAT A GOOD WORK PERFORMED BEFORE GRACE HAS BEEN OBTAINED IS ABLE TO SECURE GRACE FOR A PERSON BECAUSE IT IS NO MORE THAN RIGHT THAT GOD SHOULD REWARD A GOOD DEED
THIS PERSUASION COMETH NOT OF HIM THAT CALLETH YOU
LUTHER IS STILL THE GREATEST NAME IN PROTESTANTISM
HE DOES NOT BERATE THE GALATIANS I MARVEL THAT YE ARE SO UNSTEADY UNFAITHFUL HE SAYS I MARVEL THAT YE ARE SO SOON REMOVED HE DOES NOT ADDRESS THEM AS EVILDOERS
BUT WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN RENDER PERFECTION
THESE HYPOCRITES DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT GRACE THE GOSPEL OR CHRIST
PAUL HOWEVER REFERS PARTICULARLY TO THE ABOLITION OF THE MORAL LAW
MOSES SAYS PAUL IS THE MINISTER OF THE LAW OF SIN WRATH DEATH AND CONDEMNATION WHOEVER TEACHES THAT GOOD WORKS ARE INDISPENSABLE UNTO SALVATION THAT TO GAIN HEAVEN A PERSON MUST SUFFER AFFLICTIONS AND FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST AND OF THE SAINTS IS A MINISTER OF THE LAW OF SIN WRATH AND OF DEATH FOR THE CONSCIENCE KNOWS HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR A PERSON TO FULFILL THE LAW
FOR I NEITHER RECEIVED IT OF MAN NEITHER WAS I TAUGHT IT BUT BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST
THE PAPISTS AND THE FANATICS HATE US CONDEMN OUR DOCTRINE AND WANT TO KILL US
THE LAW CONDEMNED HIM TO THE SHAMEFUL DEATH ON THE CROSS
PAUL IS OUT TO SHOW THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT AS HOLY AS THEY LIKE TO HAVE OTHERS THINK THEY ARE
FIRST HOPE AND FAITH DIFFER IN REGARD TO THEIR SOURCES
ALTHOUGH THIS PASSAGE MAY BE APPLIED TO ANY WORK THE APOSTLE HAS IN MIND PARTICULARLY THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY
THEY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE FRUITS OF THE GOSPEL IF THEY SAW THEM
WE FIND NO REST FOR OUR WEARY BONES UNLESS WE CLING TO THE WORD OF GRACE
OUT OF PURE KINDNESS HE LOVED ME LOVED ME SO THAT HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME THAT I SHOULD BE FREE FROM THE LAW FROM SIN DEVIL AND DEATH THE WORDS THE SON OF GOD WHO LOVED ME AND GAVE HIMSELF FOR ME ARE SO MANY THUNDERCLAPS AND LIGHTNING BOLTS OF PROTEST FROM HEAVEN AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW
IDLE FAITH IS NOT JUSTIFYING FAITH
THE MONKS ARE SHOWING HIM THE PAVED WAY TO HELL
FOR IF CHRIST IS IN YOUR HEART HE NEITHER CONDEMNS YOU NOR DOES HE EVER BID YOU TO TRUST IN YOUR OWN GOOD WORKS
THIS IS A CHEERING THOUGHT
THEREFORE HE REPEATS HIS TEMPTATION TIME AND AGAIN UNTIL HE SUCCEEDS
TO THOSE THAT ARE CAST DOWN ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SINS CHRIST MUST BE INTRODUCED AS A SAVIOR AND GIFT AND NOT AS AN EXAMPLE
THE WORLD IS CRUCIFIED UNTO ME MEANS THAT I CONDEMN THE WORLD
WE ARE NOW CONCERNED WITH JUSTIFICATION
THE HYPOCRITICAL DOERS OF THE LAW ARE THOSE WHO SEEK TO OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY A MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE OF GOOD WORKS WHILE THEIR HEARTS ARE FAR REMOVED FROM GOD
WHAT SATISFACTION CAN THERE BE IN COLLECTING LAWS WITH WHICH TO TORMENT ONESELF AND OTHERS
IT MUST BE WATCHED
ONLY THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD AND THEN INADVERTENTLY FALL INTO SIN TO THEIR OWN GREAT SORROW AND REGRET CARRY THE BURDENS WHICH THE APOSTLE ENCOURAGES US TO BEAR
IF I WERE TO ACKNOWLEDGE CIRCUMCISION THE JEWS WOULD CEASE TO PERSECUTE ME
I AM GOING TO SAVE YOU BY WHAT MEANS
LED BY THE SPIRIT THE LAW CANNOT CONDEMN THE BELIEVER THOUGH HE COMMITS REAL SIN
IT GOES TO SHOW THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE GIFT OF ALLEGORY
CHRIST AND THE LAW CANNOT DWELL SIDE BY SIDE IN THE CONSCIENCE
GOD SAYS
CORNELIUS THEY POINT OUT WAS A DEVOUT MAN AND ONE THAT FEARED GOD WITH ALL HIS HOUSE WHICH GAVE MUCH ALMS TO THE PEOPLE AND PRAYED GOD ALWAYS BECAUSE OF THESE QUALIFICATIONS HE MERITED THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST
THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE AMIABLE FELLOWS
FOR THAT I BRING DOWN UPON MY HEAD THE WRATH OF JEWS AND GENTILES
AND THEY ARE ALL UNDER SIN AT THIS STATE A PERSON BEGINS TO LAMENT
VERSE 10

WHY DID HE LOVE ME AND GIVE HIMSELF FOR ME
RIGHT AWAY FOOLISH REASON IS ONCE MORE OFFENDED
I AM SOLD UNDER SIN
A TIME TO HEAR THE GOSPEL AND A TIME TO IGNORE THE GOSPEL
THEY WERE SHAMELESS BOASTERS
BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THE LAW IS WITHOUT VALUE
WITH THE LIVING FACT THAT TITUS WAS NOT COMPELLED TO BE CIRCUMCISED PAUL WAS ABLE TO SQUELCH HIS ADVERSARIES
ABRAHAM HAD TWO SONS BORN RESPECTIVELY OF HAGAR AND SARAH
THAT WE MIGHT RECEIVE THE PROMISE OF THE SPIRIT THROUGH FAITH
THAT THE PROMISE BY FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST MIGHT BE GIVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE
TO REMOVE EVERY POSSIBILITY FOR MISUNDERSTANDING I HAVE ADDED THIS EXPLANATORY NOTE
AFTER I WAS BORN GOD SUPPORTED ME
VERSE 14

SIN AND CONSCIENCE TORMENT US BUT CHRIST HAS OVERCOME THESE FIENDS NOW AND FOREVER
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT CHRIST IN ME I FIND THAT I AM ALTOGETHER HOLY
HE COULD NOT DELIVER MEN'S CONSCIENCES FROM THE TERROR OF THE LAW
11:23-25 BY THE INFIRMITY OF HIS FLESH PAUL MEANT THESE AFFLICTIONS AND NOT SOME CHRONIC DISEASE
THERE HE ARGUES THAT ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM ARE NOT THE CHILDREN OF GOD
FAITH IS A GIFT
IN WHOM
AS FOR THE POPE'S CHURCH LAWS FORBIDDING MARRIAGE AND MEATS PAUL CALLS THEM ELSEWHERE THE DOCTRINES OF DEVILS
I CONDEMN THEIR WORKS
NO PRISONER ENJOYS THE CONFINEMENT
JEROME THINKS THAT PAUL IS PLAYING UPON THE NAME GALATIANS DERIVING IT FROM THE HEBREW WORD GALATH WHICH MEANS FALLEN OR CARRIED AWAY AS THOUGH PAUL WANTED TO SAY YOU ARE TRUE GALATIANS I.E FALLEN AWAY IN NAME AND IN FACT SOME BELIEVE THAT THE GERMANS ARE DESCENDED FROM THE GALATIANS
IN OTHER WORDS THAT TRANSGRESSIONS MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH AND THUS INCREASED
HOW ABOUT RUNNING AWAY FROM GOD
BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO THINK TOO WELL OF HIM DOWN HE FELL INTO HORRIBLE SINS ADULTERY AND MURDER
BOTH THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH AND THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS MUST BE DILIGENTLY TAUGHT AND YET IN SUCH A WAY THAT BOTH THE DOCTRINES STAY WITHIN THEIR GOD-GIVEN SPHERE
BUT IT TAKES IN MORE
ZONDERVAN OF THE FIRM OF PUBLISHERS IN MARCH 1937
IN THEIR CONFESSIONAL WRITINGS FAITH OR THE MERIT OF CHRIST ARE NEVER MENTIONED
THE NAME OF THE LORD IS TO BE MENTIONED WITH GREAT REVERENCE AND THANKSGIVING
HE WOULD NOW GLADLY MAKE JERUSALEM THE SARAH OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BUT HE CANNOT
THEY APPRECIATE THIS SPIRITUAL LIBERTY AND STAND READY TO SERVE OTHERS IN LOVE AND THOUGH THEIR NUMBER IS SMALL THE SATISFACTION THEY GIVE US FAR OUTWEIGHS THE DISCOURAGEMENT WHICH WE RECEIVE AT THE HANDS OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO MISUSE THIS LIBERTY
THESE TWO TERMS GRACE AND PEACE CONSTITUTE CHRISTIANITY
I CLAIM THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO MAKE PETER OUT AS FAULTLESS
HOW ELSE WOULD THE CHURCHES BELIEVE HIM
THEY ACT AS THOUGH THE WORD OF GOD DOES NOT CONCERN THEM
OF THIS BETTER MEDIATOR PAUL SAYS
THEY WERE ENCOURAGED IN THEIR WRONG ATTITUDE BY THE FALSE APOSTLES
BY FAITH ABEL OFFERED UNTO GOD A MORE EXCELLENT SACRIFICE THAN CAIN WHEN THE SCHOLASTICS COME UPON THE PARALLEL PASSAGE IN GENESIS 4:4 THEY GET NO FURTHER THAN THE WORDS
IN CHRIST HOWEVER ALL ARE EQUAL
WE KNOW THAT PAUL HAS REFERENCE TO THE TIME OF CHRIST'S COMING
BUT THAT NO MAN IS JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW IN THE SIGHT OF GOD IT IS EVIDENT
TO DISSENT FROM HIM I CONSIDERED A CRIME WORTHY OF ETERNAL DEATH
BECAUSE OF OUR INFIRMITY THE HOLY GHOST IS SENT FORTH INTO OUR HEARTS TO PRAY FOR US ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD AND TO ASSURE US OF THE GRACE OF GOD
THERE WERE MANY EXCELLENT MEN AMONG THE PAGANS OF OLD MEN WHO NEVER HEARD OF JUSTIFICATION
MARK WHAT ROME ANSWERS JUDAS WAS A REPROBATE
WHEN A PERSON HAPPENS TO PERFORM A GOOD DEED GOD ACCEPTS IT AND AS A REWARD FOR THE GOOD DEED GOD POURS CHARITY INTO THAT PERSON
THAT LAW IS NOW IN PRISON ITSELF HELD CAPTIVE BY GRACE AND LIBERTY BY FAITH IN CHRIST A PERSON MAY GAIN SUCH SURE AND SOUND COMFORT THAT HE NEED NOT FEAR THE DEVIL SIN DEATH OR ANY EVIL
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT DO THESE THINGS YOU CANNOT LIVE IN THEM THE WORDS THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD REQUIRE PERFECT OBEDIENCE PERFECT FEAR PERFECT TRUST AND PERFECT LOVE
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT PAUL IS DISAPPOINTED
FOR WE ARE SAVED BY HOPE AS PAUL USES THE TERM HOPE HERE IN WRITING TO THE GALATIANS WE MAY TAKE IT IN EITHER OF ITS TWO MEANINGS
ON THE OTHER HAND HE IS HIGHLY INDIGNANT AT THE SEDUCERS WHOM HE BLAMES FOR THE APOSTASY OF THE GALATIANS
CHRIST SAYS HE IS THE SON OF GOD AND THE SON OF A WOMAN
WHEN IT COMES TO FAITH AND SALVATION IN THE MIDST OF LIES AND ERRORS THAT PARADE AS TRUTH AND DECEIVE MANY CHARITY HAS NO VOICE OR VOTE
SANCTIFICATION TAKES TIME
WHEN WE HAVE BECOME RIGHTEOUS THEN FIRST ARE WE ABLE AND WILLING TO DO GOOD
AGAIN WE SAY
IN THE HEROIC DEEDS OF DAVID THE SCHOLASTIC CAN DISCOVER NOTHING MORE THAN OUTWARD ACHIEVEMENT
SUCH INCIDENTS ARE RECORDED FOR OUR CONSOLATION
PRACTICE THIS KNOWLEDGE AND FORTIFY YOURSELF AGAINST DESPAIR PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST HOUR WHEN THE MEMORY OF PAST SINS ASSAILS THE CONSCIENCE
ONE PERSON IS MORE EASILY TEMPTED TO BITTERNESS AND SORROW OF SPIRIT BLASPHEMY DISTRUST AND DESPAIR
THE WORDS IF YE BE LED OF THE SPIRIT YE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW ARE REPLETE WITH COMFORT
NO ONE EXCEPT PAUL HAD HIS EYES OPEN
I BELIEVE THEREFORE HAVE I SPOKEN
CAN YOU IMAGINE A MORE ARRANT OUTRAGE THAN TO HATE GOD AND TO ABHOR HIS LAW
HOWEVER THE APOSTLES WERE NOT DETERRED BY SUCH CALUMNIES FROM PREACHING THE GOSPEL
THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION MUST BE SOUNDED IN OUR EARS INCESSANTLY BECAUSE THE FRAILTY OF OUR FLESH WILL NOT PERMIT US TO TAKE HOLD OF IT PERFECTLY AND TO BELIEVE IT WITH ALL OUR HEART
THESE WORDS ARE LIKE SO MANY THUNDERCLAPS OF PROTEST FROM HEAVEN AGAINST EVERY KIND AND TYPE OF SELF-MERIT
IF GOD WILL SPARE ME I WILL CHANGE AND LIVE RIGHT FROM NOW ON
WHEN I WAS PRESENT WITH YOU YOU LOVED ME ALTHOUGH I PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO YOU IN THE INFIRMITY OF MY FLESH
HE REPROVED PETER NOT TO EMBARRASS HIM BUT TO CONSERVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GOSPEL WHICH JUSTIFIES IN HEAVEN AND THE LAW WHICH JUSTIFIES ON EARTH
WE HAVE THE SAME GOSPEL WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT TO YOU IS COMMITTED THE GOSPEL FOR THE UNCIRCUMCISED WHILE THE GOSPEL FOR THE CIRCUMCISION IS COMMITTED UNTO US
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD FIND FAVOR WITH MEN FOR BRINGING THEM THE GOSPEL OF PEACE LIFE AND ETERNAL SALVATION
IF THEY HAD PAID ANY ATTENTION AT ALL TO THESE WORDS THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE SON OF GOD TO BE GIVEN INTO DEATH FOR ME THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE INVENTED SO MANY HIDEOUS HERESIES
NO MAN KNOWETH EITHER LOVE OR HATRED BY ALL THAT IS BEFORE THEM ECCLES
I AM ASHAMED OF YOU
ONLY THE ACTS OF A CHRISTIAN ARE TRULY GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE TO GOD BECAUSE THEY ARE DONE IN FAITH WITH A CHEERFUL HEART OUT OF GRATITUDE TO CHRIST
GRANTED THAT CORNELIUS WAS A GENTILE AND DID NOT RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST BY THE LAW YET THE TEXT PLAINLY STATES THAT HE WAS A DEVOUT MAN WHO FEARED GOD GAVE ALMS AND PRAYED
VERSES 19 20
NOT IN VIEW OF THEIR OWN WORKS BUT IN VIEW OF THE MERITS OF GOD WHICH THEY APPROPRIATE BY FAITH
ALL THESE EFFECTS OF THE LAW CANNOT BE CALLED DIVINE OR HEAVENLY
PETER AT THAT TIME VALIANTLY DEFENDED THE LIBERTY OF THE GOSPEL
AS AN EXEMPLAR HE IS TO BE PLACED BEFORE ME ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES
WHEN A PERSON HAS ACCEPTED THE GOSPEL LET HIM FIRST GIVE THANKS UNTO GOD WITH A GLAD HEART AND THEN LET HIM GET BUSY ON THE GOOD WORKS TO STRIVE FOR WORKS THAT REALLY PLEASE GOD AND NOT MAN-MADE AND SELF-CHOSEN WORKS
ISHMAEL AND ISAAC WERE BOTH THE NATURAL CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
THEY ARE WEAK AND BANKRUPT TO BEGIN WITH
OUR OPPONENTS GO EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT
THEREFORE IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RULE IN OUR CONSCIENCE PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT CHRIST PAID SO GREAT A PRICE TO DELIVER THE CONSCIENCE FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE LAW
I HAVE SEEN MANY WORK THEMSELVES DOWN TO THE BONES IN THEIR HUNGRY EFFORT TO OBTAIN PEACE OF CONSCIENCE
HE TRUSTS THEM THROUGH THE LORD INSOFAR AS THEY WERE IN CHRIST AND CHRIST IN THEM
THE TROUBLE IS THERE ARE MANY WHO REFUSE TO BE INSTRUCTED
HE OFTEN FELT MISERABLE
IT IS BAD ENOUGH THAT WE ARE WICKED SINNERS AND TRANSGRESSORS OF ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD
GOD HEARD THE GROANING HEART OF MOSES AND THE GROANS TO HIM SOUNDED LIKE LOUD SHOUTS FOR HELP
WE WILL FURNISH SOME EXAMPLES
PAUL CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MISUNDERSTOOD FOR HE SAYS
NO SELF-RIGHTEOUS PERSON EVER DOES
ABRAHAM BELIEVED IN THE LORD
I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH THAT MEANS I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO SIN NO CURSE NO EVIL IN THE CHURCH OF GOD
THIS IMPERFECTION OF OURS HOWEVER IS NOT IMPUTED TO US FOR CHRIST'S SAKE

WE DO NOT HERE AND NOW ARGUE WHETHER WE OUGHT TO DO GOOD WORKS OR WHETHER THE LAW IS ANY GOOD OR WHETHER THE LAW OUGHT TO BE KEPT AT ALL
SUCH READILY CONFESS THAT THEY ARE FREQUENT SINNERS BUT THEY REGARD THEIR SINS AS OF NO SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT THEY CANNOT EASILY BE DISSOLVED BY SOME GOOD ACTION OR THAT THEY MAY NOT APPEAR BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF CHRIST AND DEMAND THE REWARD OF ETERNAL LIFE FOR THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS
IF I LIVE SAYS HE I WILL MEND MY LIFE
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEM
IF YOU DID NOT CONFESS MY NAME THE WORLD WOULD NOT HATE YOU
MANY OF THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY PRONOUNCE WORDS OF FAITH BUT THEY BEAR NO GOOD FRUIT BECAUSE THEIR PURPOSE IS TO TURN MEN TO THEIR PERVERSE OPINIONS
I AM THAT BIG SINNER
HE SUBMITTED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM US WHO WERE UNDER THE LAW IN THESE WORDS THE APOSTLE EXPLAINS THE PERSON AND OFFICE OF CHRIST
IN THEIR BLINDNESS THEY CAST AWAY THE PRECIOUS PEARL CHRIST AND HANG ONTO THEIR STUBBORN WORKS
IT IS SURPRISING THAT SUCH GOOD MEN AS PETER BARNABAS AND OTHERS SHOULD FALL INTO UNEXPECTED ERROR ESPECIALLY IN A MATTER WHICH THEY KNEW SO WELL
WHEN YOU PREACH THE WORD OF GOD IN ITS PURITY AND ALSO LIVE ACCORDINGLY IT IS NOT YOUR OWN DOING BUT GOD'S DOING
IF THE LAW WAS NON-EXISTENT HOW COULD ABRAHAM OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY THE LAW
WHEN IT COMES TO ESTABLISHING FALSE WORSHIP AND IDOLATRY NO COST IS SPARED
A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND COOLNESS CAN BE NOTED IN THE TITLE WITH WHICH THE APOSTLE ADDRESSES THE GALATIANS
THESE PEOPLE WILL ALL PERISH FOR THEY CANNOT ESCAPE
THE LAW MUST LEAVE THE BED OF THE CONSCIENCE WHICH IS SO NARROW THAT IT CANNOT HOLD TWO AS ISAIAH SAYS CHAPTER 28 VERSE 20
NO WONDER PAUL WAS ABLE TO FORETELL THE ABOMINATIONS THAT ANTICHRIST WOULD BRING INTO THE CHURCH
WE EXALT OUR CALLING NOT TO GAIN GLORY AMONG MEN OR MONEY OR SATISFACTION OR FAVOR BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO BE ASSURED THAT THE WORDS WE SPEAK ARE THE WORDS OF GOD
THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LOVE GOD BY OUR OWN NATURAL STRENGTH TO LOVE GOD ABOVE ALL THINGS AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DESERVE GRACE
BUT ONE THING IS NEEDFUL
ACCORDING TO THIS DESCRIPTION A SAINT IS NOT ONE WHO IS MADE OF WOOD AND NEVER FEELS ANY LUSTS OR DESIRES OF THE FLESH
VERSES 22 23
VERSES 22 23
WHEN THE LAW BEGINS TO THREATEN A PERSON WITH DEATH AND THE ETERNAL WRATH OF GOD A MAN JUST CANNOT FIND ANY COMFORT AT ALL
AND I WILL PUT ENMITY BETWEEN THEE AND THE WOMAN AND BETWEEN THY SEED AND HER SEED
IN THE VERY ACT OF CIRCUMCISION HE IS NOT BEING CIRCUMCISED AND IN THE VERY ACT OF FULFILLING THE LAW HE FULFILLS IT NOT THIS SEEMS TO BE THE SIMPLE MEANING OF PAUL'S STATEMENT
CHRIST APPREHENDED BY FAITH AND DWELLING IN THE HEART CONSTITUTES CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR WHICH GOD GIVES ETERNAL LIFE
LET EVERY TRUE CHRISTIAN MARK THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE AND MARK IT WELL
THAT WAS THE VEIL WHICH MOSES PUT OVER HIS FACE
BECAUSE MONEY DOES NOT JUSTIFY WOULD YOU SAY THAT MONEY IS GOOD FOR NOTHING
IDOLATRY THE BEST RELIGION THE MOST FERVENT DEVOTION WITHOUT CHRIST IS PLAIN IDOLATRY
PETER IS DOING THE TALKING
WE ARE MOLESTED NOT BY PUNY FOES BUT BY MIGHTY ONES FOES WHO NEVER GROW TIRED OF WARRING AGAINST US
ISAIAH CALLS THE CHURCH BARREN BECAUSE HER CHILDREN ARE BORN WITHOUT EFFORT BY THE WORD OF FAITH THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF GOD
SATAN HATES THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL
THEY ACT AS IF THEY WERE THE ONLY TRUE GOSPEL-PREACHERS
THE MANY SECTS AT PRESENT HAVE COME INTO BEING BECAUSE ONE SECT CONDEMNS THE OTHER
BUT HE DID PROTEST AGAINST CIRCUMCISION BEING MADE A CONDITION FOR SALVATION
BUT BECAUSE OUR FAITH RESTS ON THE PROMISES OF THE INFINITE GOD HIS PROMISES ARE ALSO INFINITE SO MUCH SO THAT NOTHING CAN ACCUSE OR CONDEMN US
IF HIS EPISTLE IS TOO SEVERE IT WILL DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS FOR THE HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM IS VERY GREAT
WHEN THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS CEASES WHEN THE RAGE OF THE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS ABATES WHEN EVERYTHING IS QUIET IT IS A SIGN THAT THE DEVIL IS THE DOOR-KEEPER OF THE CHURCH AND THAT THE PURE DOCTRINE OF GOD'S WORD HAS BEEN LOST
ON ONE OCCASION JESUS SAID TO HIS DISCIPLES
BUT LET NOT GOD SPEAK WITH US LEST WE DIE EX
IN THIS WAY HE SUCCEEDED IN REGAINING MANY
BUT GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD GLORY SAVE IN THE CROSS OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
HE ANSWERED
TO ENTERTAIN A TRUE CONCEPTION OF CHRIST IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEVIL DESCRIBES CHRIST AS AN EXACTING AND CRUEL JUDGE WHO CONDEMNS AND PUNISHES MEN
HE RECEIVED THE GOSPEL BY SPECIAL REVELATION DIRECTLY FROM JESUS CHRIST
THE LAW WAS ADDED BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSIONS PEOPLE SAY THAT PAUL ABROGATED THE LAW THAT HE IS A RADICAL THAT HE BLASPHEMED GOD WHEN HE SAID THAT
THIS RENEWAL BY THE HOLY SPIRIT MAY NOT BE CONSPICUOUS TO THE WORLD BUT IT IS PATENT TO US BY OUR BETTER JUDGMENT OUR IMPROVED SPEECH AND OUR UNASHAMED CONFESSION OF CHRIST
THE RIGHT SEPARATION BETWEEN LAW AND GOSPEL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
HE PERMITTED THE LAW TO ACCUSE HIM SIN TO CONDEMN HIM AND DEATH TO TAKE HIM TO ABOLISH THE LAW TO CONDEMN SIN AND TO DESTROY DEATH FOR ME
WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SUCH AN ENORMOUS PRICE WAS PAID FOR YOU WILL YOU STILL COME ALONG WITH YOUR COWL YOUR SHAVEN PATE YOUR CHASTITY YOUR OBEDIENCE YOUR POVERTY YOUR WORKS YOUR MERITS
IF YE BE CHRIST'S MEANS IF YOU BELIEVE IN CHRIST
VERSES 8 AND 9
OH NO THEY SAY WE WILL FLY STRAIGHT INTO HEAVEN
THAT I PERSONALLY SHOULD BELIEVE IN THE SON OF GOD AND THAT I SHOULD REVEAL HIM TO THE GENTILES PAUL DOES NOT MENTION THE JEWS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE WAS THE CALLED AND ACKNOWLEDGED APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES ALTHOUGH HE PREACHED CHRIST ALSO TO THE JEWS
WHEN THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT HAS BEEN LOST THERE CAN BE NO AGREEMENT IN DOCTRINE OR LIFE
BUT NOW AFTER THAT YE HAVE KNOWN GOD OR RATHER ARE KNOWN OF GOD HOW TURN YE AGAIN TO THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS WHEREUNTO YE DESIRE AGAIN TO BE IN BONDAGE
LATER ON IN THE SIXTH CHAPTER HE EXPLICITLY STATES THEY THEMSELVES WHICH ARE CIRCUMCISED KEEP NOT THE LAW
SHE ABASED HERSELF
INDEED THE WHOLE PAPACY AMOUNTS TO NOTHING MORE THAN A MERE KOWTOWING OF PERSONS AND OUTWARD MUMMERY
THE TRUE WAY OF BECOMING A CHRISTIAN IS TO BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST AND NOT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
OR ON ACCOUNT OF MY PHARISAICAL RELIGION
IN THE FIRST AND SECOND CHAPTERS OF THE EPISTLE TO TITUS THE APOSTLE ADMONISHES BISHOPS YOUNG WOMEN AND MARRIED FOLKS TO BE CHASTE AND PURE
THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE APOSTLE CHOOSES THE SOFTER TERM FAULT TO MINIMIZE THE OFFENSE STILL MORE AS IF HE MEANT TO EXCUSE IT ALTOGETHER AND TO TAKE THE WHOLE BLAME AWAY FROM THE PERSON WHO HAS COMMITTED THE FAULT HE SPEAKS OF HIM AS HAVING BEEN OVERTAKEN SEDUCED BY THE DEVIL AND OF THE FLESH
AND THE THING WAS VERY GRIEVOUS IN ABRAHAM'S SIGHT BECAUSE OF HIS SON GEN
ALTHOUGH I AM ABSENT IN THE FLESH I AM WITH YOU IN SPIRIT AND IN MY DOCTRINE WHICH YOU OUGHT TO RETAIN BY ALL MEANS BECAUSE THROUGH IT YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT VERSE 19
HERE IS CHRIST
WHEN PAUL SPEAKS OF THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL HE IMPLIES BY CONTRAST A FALSE GOSPEL
I FEAR THAT AFTER OUR TIME THE RIGHT HANDLING OF THE LAW WILL BECOME A LOST ART
THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE FLESH IS UNABLE TO THINK SPEAK OR DO ANYTHING EXCEPT AGAINST GOD
SIN MAY ASSAIL HIM BUT HE IS NOT TO WELCOME IT
WHEN GRACE HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED ANY GOOD WORK DESERVES EVERLASTING LIFE AS A DUE PAYMENT AND REWARD FOR MERIT
I AM TOLD THAT IT IS PREPOSTEROUS AND WICKED TO CALL THE SON OF GOD A CURSED SINNER
I AM ANGRY WITH YOU BUT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO CALL THEM BACK TO THE GOSPEL
THEY ARE SLAVES
GOD HAD NOT ONLY BROUGHT YOU TO FAITH BY MY PREACHING
LET THE LAW ALSO SERVE ITS UNIQUE PURPOSE
WHEN PAUL SPEAKS OF THOSE CALLED BY MAN I TAKE IT HE MEANS THOSE WHO HAVE A DIVINE CALL EXTENDED TO THEM THROUGH OTHER PERSONS
I HAVE GOOD REASON FOR CALLING YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS
THE WORLD OF COURSE LOOKS UPON US AS UNHAPPY AND ACCURSED CREATURES BUT CHRIST FOR WHOSE SAKE WE SUFFER PRONOUNCES US BLESSED AND BIDS US TO REJOICE
FIRST HAVE FAITH IN CHRIST AND CHRIST WILL ENABLE YOU TO DO AND TO LIVE
NO WONDER THEY ABIDE UNDER THE CURSE OF GOD
SO THE PEOPLE OF NINEVEH BELIEVED GOD AND PROCLAIMED A FAST AND PUT ON SACKCLOTH THEY REPENTED
VERSE 13
VERSE 13
VERSE 13
THEREFORE WE MUST CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY NOT ONLY FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION BUT ALSO FOR THE COMFORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE WEAK IN FAITH
HIS USEFULNESS TO ALL THE CHURCHES THAT HAD USED HIM AS THEIR PASTOR AND TEACHER WAS AT STAKE
WHEN DAVID AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD NO FOOD WITH WHICH TO STILL THEIR HUNGER THEY ATE THE SHOWBREAD WHICH LAY-PEOPLE WERE FORBIDDEN TO EAT
BUT YOU CANNOT QUARREL ABOUT SALVATION OR DAMNATION ABOUT ETERNAL LIFE AND ETERNAL DEATH WITHOUT GRAVE DAMAGE TO THE CHURCH
HE KNOWS THAT CHRIST HIMSELF MADE AMPLE USE OF PARABLES
A TIME TO LEARN THE LAW AND A TIME TO UNLEARN THE LAW
HE HAS ABOLISHED THE LAW CONDEMNED SIN VANQUISHED DEATH AND DESTROYED HELL FOR ME
PAUL IS SPEAKING OF A FAR BETTER LIBERTY THE LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE NOT FROM MATERIAL BONDS NOT FROM THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY NOT FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE TURKS BUT FROM THE ETERNAL WRATH OF GOD
THEREFORE REASON LOOKS DOWN UPON THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH AND ITS TRULY GOOD WORKS
YOUR FALSE APOSTLES LIE WHEN THEY SAY THAT I CIRCUMCISED TIMOTHY SHAVED MY HEAD IN CENCHREA AND WENT UP TO JERUSALEM AT THE REQUEST OF THE APOSTLES
YOU CANNOT SHOW ME THAT THIS EVER HAPPENED
ST PAUL ALSO PRESENTS A TRUE PICTURE OF CHRIST AS THE VIRGIN-BORN SON OF GOD DELIVERED INTO DEATH FOR OUR SINS
UNBELIEVERS ENJOY MORE TEMPORAL BLESSINGS THAN THE CHRISTIANS
CHARITY SUFFERS ALL THINGS IT GIVES IN
THE LAW IS NOT GIVEN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS MAN
BECAUSE OF THIS THEY DELIVERED HIM REJECTED HIS DOCTRINE AND BOOSTED THEIR OWN
CORNELIUS WAS A GENTILE
BY THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD THE APOSTLE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS AS SOME HAVE THOUGHT
AT THE SAME TIME THEY BLITHELY IGNORED THE DUTIES OF CHARITY AND HATED EACH OTHER TO DEATH
MY SINS ARE NOT IMAGINARY TRANSGRESSIONS BUT SINS AGAINST THE FIRST TABLE UNBELIEF DOUBT DESPAIR CONTEMPT HATRED IGNORANCE OF GOD INGRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM MISUSE OF HIS NAME NEGLECT OF HIS WORD ETC
THEIR FOUNDATION VITIATED THEY CAN ONLY BUILD WOOD HAY AND STUBBLE
THESE INCIDENTS INDICATE THAT LOVE OUGHT TO BE GIVEN CONSIDERATION ABOVE ALL LAWS AND CEREMONIES
WE MUST HAVE OFFENDED YOU SOMEHOW PAUL ANSWERS
THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS EXPRESSLY STATES
TEMPERANCE CHRISTIANS ARE TO LEAD SOBER AND CHASTE LIVES
AS LONG AS A PERSON REMAINS A HUMAN BEING SO LONG IS HE TO BE AN OBJECT OF OUR LOVE
I HAVE DESCRIBED TO YOU WHAT SPIRITUAL LIFE IS
CHRIST SENT ME...TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
GOD SENT HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON INTO THE WORLD THAT WE MAY LIVE THROUGH HIS MERIT
FAITH IS A JUDGE
I AM TOLD THAT I BEGAN IN THE SPIRIT UNDER THE PAPACY BUT AM ENDING UP IN THE FLESH BECAUSE I GOT MARRIED
BUT THE LAW OF THE MEMBERS STRIVES AGAINST THE LAW OF THE MIND AND MAKES PERFECT JOY AND FAITH IMPOSSIBLE
BUT WHEN PETER WAS COME TO ANTIOCH I WITHSTOOD HIM TO THE FACE BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE BLAMED
IF WE ONLY TEACH FAITH PEOPLE WILL COME TO THINK THAT GOOD WORKS ARE SUPERFLUOUS
THE ARGUMENT OF THE APOSTLE AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW IS IMPREGNABLE
THE TRUTH IS THAT BY CIRCUMCISION YOU HAVE BECOME DEBTORS AND SERVANTS OF THE LAW
THIS TRANSFUSION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WE OBTAIN FROM CHRIST BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN HIM
TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE HE ADDUCES THREATS AND PROMISES TRYING IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO KEEP THEM IN THE LIBERTY WHICH CHRIST PURCHASED FOR THEM
SUCH SNAKES IN THE GRASS ARE EQUAL TO ANYTHING
II COR
THIS PROMISE IS GIVEN
I MUST WORK THE WORKS OF HIM THAT SENT ME WHILE IT IS DAY
YOU ARE REMINDING ME OF GOD'S FATHERLY GOODNESS TOWARD ME THAT HE SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE
ALL RIGHT
IN SUPPORT OF HIS STATEMENT HE QUOTES THE PASSAGE FROM THE SONG OF HEZEKIAH
WHAT A MISERABLE THING TO ENDURE SO MANY AFFLICTIONS FOR NOTHING VERSE 4
MAN'S FOLLY HOWEVER IS SO PRODIGIOUS THAT INSTEAD OF EMBRACING THE MESSAGE OF GRACE WITH ITS GUARANTEE OF THE FORGIVENESS OF SIN FOR CHRIST'S SAKE MAN FINDS HIMSELF MORE LAWS TO SATISFY HIS CONSCIENCE
I TESTIFY TO EVERY MAN WHO IS BEING CIRCUMCISED THAT HE CANNOT PERFORM THE LAW IN ANY POINT
WHAT COUNTS IS THAT WE PUT ON CHRIST
FOR THIS REASON THE PROPHETS APOSTLES AND CHRIST HIMSELF URGE YES COMMAND US TO REJOICE AND BE GLAD
WE MUST THEN SAY TO THE LAW
THEY ZEALOUSLY AFFECT YOU BUT NOT WELL
TO WORK PRAY OR SUFFER APART FROM CHRIST IS TO WORK PRAY AND TO SUFFER IN VAIN FOR WHATSOEVER IS NOT OF FAITH IS SIN IT DOES A PERSON NO GOOD TO BE CIRCUMCISED TO FAST TO PRAY OR TO DO ANYTHING IF IN HIS HEART HE DESPISES CHRIST
PARADOXICALLY A CHRISTIAN IS BOTH RIGHT AND WRONG HOLY AND PROFANE AN ENEMY OF GOD AND A CHILD OF GOD
THIS KEEPS A CHRISTIAN HUMBLE
THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE ENOUGH
9:33 DO NOT DESPAIR IF YOU FEEL THE FLESH BATTLING AGAINST THE SPIRIT OR IF YOU CANNOT MAKE IT BEHAVE
NOT MINDED OTHERWISE THAN I HAVE TAUGHT YOU
TO BE AN APOSTLE HE HAD TO HAVE HIS APPOINTMENT FROM GOD
WHEN A SINNER GETS WISE TO HIMSELF HE DOES NOT ONLY FEEL MISERABLE HE FEELS LIKE MISERY PERSONIFIED
THIS TEXT WAS CONVERTED TO ASCII FORMAT FOR PROJECT WITTENBERG BY LAURA J
WHEN WE HEAR THAT CHRIST WAS MADE A CURSE FOR US LET US BELIEVE IT WITH JOY AND ASSURANCE
NO DOUBT THE FALSE APOSTLES TOOK EVERY OCCASION TO DEFAME PAUL AS A STUBBORN AND CONTEMPTUOUS FELLOW WHO THOUGHT NOTHING OF DISRUPTING THE UNITY OF THE CHURCHES FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN HIS SELFISH PRIDE AND JEALOUSY
THERE IS NO SATISFACTION IN THE LAW
THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY
BUT AFTER HIS CONVERSION HIS TONGUE SPOKE A SPIRITUAL HEAVENLY LANGUAGE
HOW PATIENTLY PAUL DEALS WITH HIS SEDUCED GALATIANS
NOTHING WOULD BE MORE WELCOME TO US THAN EARLY DEATH KNOWING THAT IT WOULD SPELL THE END OF ALL OUR MISERIES AND THE BEGINNING OF ALL OUR HAPPINESS
EITHER CHRIST MUST LIVE AND THE LAW PERISH OR THE LAW REMAINS AND CHRIST MUST PERISH
THERE WERE SOME WHO CLUNG TO THE RIGHT VIEW OF THE WORD AND THE SACRAMENTS
THE ONE FROM THE MOUNT SINAI WHICH GENDERETH TO BONDAGE WHICH IS AGAR
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD ABRAHAM WAS A CONDEMNED SINNER
NOT ONLY IS HE ABLE TO DECEIVE THE SELF-ASSURED BUT EVEN THOSE WHO PROFESS THE TRUE CHRISTIAN FAITH
FOR IT HAD BEEN BETTER FOR US TO SERVE THE EGYPTIANS THAN THAT WE SHOULD DIE IN THE WILDERNESS EX
GENTLENESS CAN OVERLOOK OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULTS AND COVER THEM UP
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU TO BE LOCKED UP FOR A WHILE
THE APOSTLE DIGRESSES A LITTLE FROM HIS IMMEDIATE THEME
GOOD WORKS MAY IMPROVE THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE BUT THEY CANNOT PRODUCE A NEW CREATURE
THE POPE IS THE ANTICHRIST BECAUSE HE IS AGAINST CHRIST BECAUSE HE TAKES LIBERTIES WITH THE THINGS OF GOD BECAUSE HE LORDS IT OVER THE TEMPLE OF GOD
THOSE WHO TEACH ERRORS PROVOKE OTHERS
FAITH THEY SAY MAKES MEN RECKLESS WHAT DO THESE LAW-WORKERS KNOW ABOUT FAITH WHEN THEY ARE SO BUSY CALLING PEOPLE BACK FROM BAPTISM FROM FAITH FROM THE PROMISES OF CHRIST TO THE LAW
YOU CANNOT DENY IT
THE FACT THAT THESE PROMISES WERE MADE UNTO THE FATHERS CONCERNING CHRIST IMPLIES THAT THE FATHERS WERE SUBJECT TO THE CURSE OF SIN AND ETERNAL DEATH
NEVER WILL THE CONSCIENCE TRUST IN GOD UNLESS IT CAN BE SURE OF GOD'S MERCY AND PROMISES IN CHRIST
WHY SHOULD WE NOW FEAR THE GRAVE
GOD ACCORDINGLY USES THE LAW FOR A HAMMER TO BREAK UP THE ILLUSION OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT WE SHOULD DESPAIR OF OUR OWN STRENGTH AND EFFORTS AT SELF-JUSTIFICATION
WE ARE TO SAY TO THEM
OUR SAVIOR SAYS
FORGIVE IT
THIS IS NO PREACHING TO PLEASE MEN
IF THEY CONTINUE IN THEIR WICKED THOUGHTS OF GOD THEY WILL DIE IN THEIR IDOLATRY
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH BECAUSE I LOVE YOU VERSE 17
FAITH SAYS WHAT IS TO BE DONE
IF WE THINK OF CHRIST AS PAUL HERE DEPICTS HIM WE SHALL NEVER GO WRONG
PAUL SAYS
PAUL SAYS
PAUL SAYS
WHY SHOULD HE BE SO STUBBORN IN SUCH SMALL MATTERS
I KNOW BETTER NOW
YE DID RUN WELL MEANS THAT EVERYTHING WENT ALONG SMOOTHLY AND HAPPILY WITH THE GALATIANS
PAUL PAID NO REGARD TO THE DIGNITY AND POSITION OF PETER WHEN HE SAW THIS ARTICLE IN DANGER
IF ANY MAN PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL UNTO YOU THAN THAT YE HAVE RECEIVED LET HIM BE ACCURSED
6:8 THE GOSPEL ENTAILS PERSECUTION
NOTE THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF THE DEVIL
BUT PAUL DOES NOT MIND THE ENMITY OF THE WORLD
PAUL QUOTES THE ALLEGORICAL PROPHECY OF ISAIAH TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MOTHER OF MANY CHILDREN MUST DIE DESOLATELY WHILE THE BARREN WOMAN SHALL HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF CHILDREN
WHAT REASON HAVE THE FALSE APOSTLES TO BOAST THAT THE GOSPEL OF PETER WAS MIGHTY THAT HE CONVERTED MANY THAT HE WROUGHT GREAT MIRACLES AND THAT HIS VERY SHADOW HEALED THE SICK
YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT CHRIST MIGHT HAVE ATONED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD WITH ONE SINGLE DROP OF HIS BLOOD
IN ALL THAT SARAH HATH SAID UNTO THEE HEARKEN UNTO HER VOICE
IN OTHER WORDS I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT NO DOCTRINE THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE ONE YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM ME VERSE 10
THE CLERICS ARE TYRANTS AND BUTCHERS OF MEN'S CONSCIENCE
MY OPPONENTS LOST OUT THE MATTER UPON WHICH THE APOSTLES DELIBERATED IN CONFERENCE WAS THIS
YOU LET THE LAW TALK TO YOUR CONSCIENCE
PERFECT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS STILL TO BE ATTAINED
THE PROPER ANSWER IS
WHENEVER WE SEPARATE THE PERSON OF CHRIST FROM OUR OWN PERSON WE LIVE UNDER THE LAW AND NOT IN CHRIST
IF A PERSON COULD FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SON AND HEIR OF GOD HE WOULD RATE THE MIGHT AND WEALTH OF NATIONS SMALL CHANGE IN COMPARISON WITH HIS HEAVENLY INHERITANCE
WHENEVER PAUL WRITES TO THE CHRISTIANS HERE AND THERE HE CALLS THEM THE HOLY CHILDREN AND HEIRS OF GOD
YOU YOURSELF SAY PAUL THAT WE HAVE THE FLESH WHICH WARS AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND BRINGS US INTO SUBJECTION BUT PAUL SAYS NOT TO LET IT TROUBLE US
AND THEY GLORIFIED GOD IN ME
THE WICKEDNESS ERROR DARKNESS IGNORANCE IN MY MIND AND MY WILL WERE SO GREAT THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE SAVED BY ANY OTHER MEANS THAN BY THE INESTIMABLE PRICE OF CHRIST'S DEATH
THE ACCENT IS ON THE TWO WORDS FOR US CHRIST IS PERSONALLY INNOCENT
THIS CARNAL LIBERTY THE PEOPLE WANT IN OUR DAY
UNTO ANOTHER GOSPEL
A TESTAMENT IS NOT A LAW BUT AN INHERITANCE
LOOK UPON IT AS A HAPPY INDICATION THAT ALL IS WELL WITH THE GOSPEL OF THE CROSS
LET US SEE WHAT PAUL HAS IN MIND
THE BELIEVING ABRAHAM IS NOT TO LIE BURIED IN THE GRAVE
THE LAW DOES NOT SECURE RIGHTEOUSNESS
PETER HAD HEARD THE COMMAND OF CHRIST GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE BUT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE HEAVENLY VISION AND THE SPECIAL COMMAND OF CHRIST PETER WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO THE HOME OF CORNELIUS
FOR I KNOW NOTHING BY MYSELF SAYS PAUL YET AM I NOT HEREBY JUSTIFIED I COR
WHEN THE DEVIL FINDS THAT HE CANNOT OVERCOME CERTAIN PERSONS BY FORCE HE TRIES TO OVERCOME THEM IN THE LONG RUN
THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK OF ABRAHAM AS HE STANDS BEFORE GOD A MAN JUSTIFIED BY FAITH
BUT BECAUSE WE OFTEN FEEL FEAR AND DOUBT WE CANNOT COME TO THAT HAPPY CERTAINTY
BUT HE OF THE FREEWOMAN WAS BY PROMISE
AS CERTAIN AS WE ARE THAT CHRIST PLEASES GOD SO SURE OUGHT WE TO BE THAT WE ALSO PLEASE GOD BECAUSE CHRIST IS IN US
WITH THE PROPHET HE WILL THEN CONFESS
IT MUST BE A FAITH THAT PERFORMS GOOD WORKS THROUGH LOVE
THEY SUPPOSED THEY WERE BEING TAUGHT BY CHRIST HIMSELF
ERGO I AM ABOVE THE SCRIPTURES
THESE EFFECTS ARE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD
OUTWARDLY I KEPT MYSELF CHASTE POOR AND OBEDIENT
IN ORDER THAT THE WORD OF GOD AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH MAY BE KEPT PURE AND UNDEFILED LET THE APOSTLES LET AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN LET PETER LET PAUL LET THEM ALL PERISH
OUR FEELINGS SHY AT A PERSONAL APPLICATION OF THE PRONOUN OUR AND WE REFUSE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOD UNTIL WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES WORTHY BY GOOD DEEDS
WHEREUNTO YE DESIRE AGAIN TO BE IN BONDAGE
TRUE BELIEVERS ARE NO HYPOCRITES
SPIRITUALLY IT MEANS THAT THE LAW IS NOT TO OPERATE ON A PERSON AFTER HE HAS BEEN HUMBLED AND FRIGHTENED BY THE EXPOSURE OF HIS SINS AND THE WRATH OF GOD
THE LAW HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL ME HOW I MAY BE DELIVERED FROM SIN DEATH AND HELL
WHEN IT COMES TO PERSECUTING US THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE IN DOUBT AND UNCERTAINTY ONE MINUTE
BUT THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT IS LOVE JOY PEACE LONGSUFFERING GENTLENESS GOODNESS FAITH MEEKNESS TEMPERANCE
NEITHER WENT I UP TO JERUSALEM TO THEM WHICH WERE APOSTLES BEFORE ME
NEITHER WENT I UP TO JERUSALEM TO THEM WHICH WERE APOSTLES BEFORE ME
AND LABOUR WORKING WITH OUR HANDS
BUT THOU LORD JESUS HAST A HEAVEN TO GIVE UNTO ME
PAUL PRODUCES HIS PROOF IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY
TO FALL FROM GRACE MEANS TO LOSE THE ATONEMENT THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS LIBERTY AND LIFE WHICH JESUS HAS MERITED FOR US BY HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION
PAUL DOES NOT HERE SPEAK OF CRUCIFYING THE FLESH BUT HE SPEAKS OF THAT HIGHER CRUCIFYING WHEREIN SIN DEVIL AND DEATH ARE CRUCIFIED IN CHRIST AND IN ME
GOD JUDGES OUR LIVES DIFFERENTLY
BUT THIS DOES NOT BOTHER ME BECAUSE IF I WERE TO TRUST IN MY OWN GOOD DEEDS OR DESPAIR BECAUSE I HAVE DONE NO GOOD DEEDS CHRIST WOULD PROFIT ME NEITHER WAY
HOW WERE THEY TO ESCAPE
I WOULD HONOR THE POPE I WOULD LOVE HIS PERSON IF HE WOULD LEAVE MY CONSCIENCE ALONE AND NOT COMPEL ME TO SIN AGAINST GOD
AND ANSWERETH TO JERUSALEM WHICH NOW IS AND IS IN BONDAGE WITH HER CHILDREN
COMMERCIAL PRIESTS COUNTED THE DAILY OFFERINGS
YET HIS FLESH WAS CLEANSED THE GOD OF ISRAEL WAS REVEALED UNTO HIM AND HE RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
TO REJECT THE GRACE OF GOD IS A COMMON SIN OF WHICH EVERYBODY IS GUILTY WHO SEES ANY RIGHTEOUSNESS IN HIMSELF OR IN HIS DEEDS
WHAT TO DO
IN THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS WE FIND A CATALOGUE OF VARIOUS WORKS AND DEEDS OF THE SAINTS OF THE BIBLE
HE WAS NOT A LAW-GIVER BUT A LAW-TAKER
I AM CHRIST BUT IT AMOUNTS TO THAT
IF MY SALVATION WAS SO DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT IT NECESSITATED THE DEATH OF CHRIST THEN ALL MY WORKS ALL THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING
THOU COMEST TO ME WITH A SWORD AND WITH A SPEAR AND WITH A SHIELD
IT DOES NOT BRING A PERSON TO HEAVEN
IN THE MEANWHILE I CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT EVENTUALLY MY FLESH WILL BE MADE PERFECT IN THE RESURRECTION
FOR YOU TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE SPIRIT IN ALL THINGS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE ON THE PART OF THE FLESH IS IMPOSSIBLE
SECONDLY BY THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST WHO ENGENDERS NEW LIFE AND ACTIVITY IN US
IN A LITTLE WRATH I HID MY FACE FROM THEE FOR A MOMENT
22:40 IF THE LAW REQUIRES CHARITY CHARITY IS PART OF THE LAW AND NOT OF FAITH
INSOMUCH THAT BARNABAS ALSO WAS CARRIED AWAY WITH THEIR DISSIMULATION
IF WE ARE DEAD TO THE LAW AND THE LAW IS DEAD TO US HOW CAN IT POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO OUR JUSTIFICATION
THE LAW ENFORCES GOOD BEHAVIOR AT LEAST OUTWARDLY
BY FAITH ALONE CAN WE BECOME RIGHTEOUS FOR FAITH INVESTS US WITH THE SINLESSNESS OF CHRIST
HE HAD TO DEAL WITH SATAN AND HIS AGENTS WHO ENDEAVORED TO DEPRIVE HIM OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST WHO WAS RAISED BY GOD THE FATHER FROM THE DEAD
FAITH CONNECTS YOU SO INTIMATELY WITH CHRIST THAT HE AND YOU BECOME AS IT WERE ONE PERSON
THE SCHOLASTICS CARICATURE CHRIST INTO A JUDGE AND TORMENTOR
VERSES 18 19
NOWHERE
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DISCORD PAUL LAYS DOWN THE PRINCIPLE
FOR ALL THAT THEY MUDDLE LAW AND GOSPEL
SPEAK THOU WITH US AND WE WILL HEAR
SPEAK THOU WITH US AND WE WILL HEAR
LOVE GOD AND YOUR NEIGHBOR
THROUGH THIS MAN CHRIST IS PREACHED UNTO YOU FORGIVENESS OF SINS
THE LAW IS NOT THAT KIND OF A SCHOOLMASTER
I MUST LISTEN TO THE GOSPEL
THIS PECULIARITY CAN BE TRACED IN THE APOSTOLIC WRITINGS PARTICULARLY IN THOSE OF PAUL
THAT THY DAYS MAY BE LONG UPON THE LAND EX
IF YOU SEE A BROTHER DESPONDENT OVER A SIN HE HAS COMMITTED RUN UP TO HIM REACH OUT YOUR HAND TO HIM COMFORT HIM WITH THE GOSPEL AND EMBRACE HIM LIKE A MOTHER
CHRIST ALONE CAN SUPPLY US WITH PERFECT RIGHTEOUSNESS
THE LAW IS ALSO A LIGHT LIKE THE GOSPEL
HENCE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW IS AT BOTTOM NOTHING BUT LOVE OF SIN AND HATRED OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
FAR FROM IT
CHRIST IS NO SHERIFF
GOD ALONE COULD ABOLISH SIN DESTROY DEATH AND TAKE AWAY THE CURSE OF THE LAW
SO DID ALL THE APOSTLES
THESE BLIND LEADERS OF THE BLIND TURN THE POOR PEOPLE OVER TO THE MERCY OF SIN DEATH AND THE DEVIL
PAUL TRACES HIS MOVEMENTS CAREFULLY IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE GALATIANS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN THE DISCIPLE OF ANY APOSTLE
BUT WHEN YOU DEAL WITH CONSCIENCE AND WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS OVER AGAINST THE LAW SIN DEATH AND THE DEVIL YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR MIND TO ALL INQUIRIES INTO THE NATURE OF GOD AND CONCENTRATE UPON JESUS CHRIST WHO SAYS COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST DOING THIS YOU WILL RECOGNIZE THE POWER AND MAJESTY CONDESCENDING TO YOUR CONDITION ACCORDING TO PAUL'S STATEMENT TO THE COLOSSIANS IN CHRIST ARE HID ALL THE TREASURES OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE AND IN HIM DWELLETH ALL THE FULNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY PAUL IN WISHING GRACE AND PEACE NOT ALONE FROM GOD THE FATHER BUT ALSO FROM JESUS CHRIST WANTS TO WARN US AGAINST THE CURIOUS INCURSIONS INTO THE NATURE OF GOD
HOLD FAST THE LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE YOU FREE THOSE WHO LOLL CANNOT KEEP THIS LIBERTY
OUR CONSCIENCE IS FREE AND QUIET BECAUSE IT NO LONGER HAS TO FEAR THE WRATH OF GOD
IT SEEMS TO BE A BY-PRODUCT OF THE GOSPEL THAT NOBODY WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE GOSPEL MINISTRY
THE APOSTLE IS CAREFUL TO MENTION THE EXACT NUMBER OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS
YES
DO NOT THINK THAT THE GALATIANS WERE THE ONLY ONES TO BE BEWITCHED BY THE DEVIL
MAYBE THE PEOPLE ARE LITTLE IMPRESSED BY THE THREATS OF GOD BUT IN THE HOUR OF THEIR DEATH THEY SHALL KNOW WHOM THEY HAVE MOCKED
IF THE MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST HAD LOST OUT GOD HIMSELF WOULD HAVE LOST OUT WHICH OF COURSE IS IMPOSSIBLE
IN CIVIL LIFE WE MUST OF COURSE PAY ATTENTION TO LAWS AND DEEDS BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL LIFE WE MUST NOT THINK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY LAWS AND WORKS BUT ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THE PROMISE AND BLESSING OF CHRIST OUR ONLY SAVIOR
WAS NOT ONE REFERENCE TO THEM SUFFICIENT
IN CIVIL LIFE OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW IS SEVERELY REQUIRED
IF YOU WANT TO OBTAIN THESE PRICELESS BENEFITS YOU MUST ENGAGE IN CORRESPONDINGLY GREAT EFFORTS
WHO WOULD NOT DETEST HIS OWN VOWS HIS COWLS HIS SHAVEN CROWN HIS BEARDED TRADITIONS YES THE VERY LAW OF MOSES WHEN HE HEARS THAT FOR SUCH THINGS HE REJECTED THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE DEATH OF CHRIST
I TELL YOU I STOOD IN AWE OF THE POPE'S AUTHORITY
IT STAYS
PAUL DOES NOT DENY THE FACT THAT HE IS LIVING IN THE FLESH
UNCONVINCED THE JEWS FIERCELY OPPOSED PAUL ASSERTING THAT THE LAW OUGHT TO BE KEPT AND THAT THE GENTILES OUGHT TO BE CIRCUMCISED OR ELSE THEY COULD NOT BE SAVED
THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF PERSONS PLACES RITES RELIGIONS CEREMONIES BUT AS FAR AS THEIR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS ARE CONCERNED THEY ARE ALL ALIKE
LET THEM SHOW ME IF THEY CAN A MORE EARNEST DEFENDER OF THE MOSAIC LAW THAN I WAS AT ONE TIME
WHEN OTHERS DISAPPROVE AND REJECT THE DOCTRINE THE TEACHERS OF ERRORS GET ANGRY IN TURN AND THEN YOU HAVE STRIFE AND TROUBLE
THE SECTARIANS HATE US FURIOUSLY BECAUSE WE WILL NOT APPROVE THEIR ERRORS
FROM HIM THAT CALLED YOU INTO THE GRACE OF CHRIST
WHEN PAUL SAW THAT PETER'S ATTITUDE TENDED TO THIS HE WITHSTOOD PETER AND SAID TO HIM
HERESIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOUND IN THE CHURCH
HE PRONOUNCES THOSE WHO SOW TO THE SPIRIT BLESSED FOR THIS LIFE AND THE LIFE TO COME WHILE THOSE WHO SOW TO THE FLESH ARE ACCURSED NOW AND FOREVER
IF THE POPE WOULD CONCEDE THAT GOD ALONE BY HIS GRACE THROUGH CHRIST JUSTIFIES SINNERS WE WOULD CARRY HIM IN OUR ARMS WE WOULD KISS HIS FEET
AFTER THE PRECEDING WELL-TAKEN ARGUMENT PAUL OFFERS ANOTHER BASED ON THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN A MAN'S TESTAMENT AND GOD'S TESTAMENT
IF YOU WERE TO GET INTO TROUBLE OR DANGER YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LOVE AND HELP OF ALL MEN
MOSES TOLD THE PEOPLE
THIS IS CERTAINLY A FIENDISH ILLUSION
WE NEED CHRIST
I HAVE A HIGHER AND BETTER OFFICE
WHEN WE JEWS COMPARE OURSELVES WITH THE GENTILES WE LOOK PRETTY GOOD
WE ARE NOT TO WASTE TIME THINKING HOW UNWORTHY WE ARE OF THE BLESSINGS OF GOD
TO BE A CHILD OF GOD REQUIRES FAITH IN CHRIST
WHENEVER YOU ARE BEING PRAISED REMEMBER IT IS NOT YOU WHO IS BEING PRAISED BUT CHRIST TO WHOM ALL PRAISE BELONGS
NOT FOR SINS THAT CAN BE DISCARDED BUT FOR SINS THAT ARE STUBBORNLY INGRAINED
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE FACT
HENCE WE HOPE FOR IT
YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH IN CHRIST
HE ADDS THE SIMILE
IF HE COULD HE WOULD SMASH THE PRISON AND FIND HIS FREEDOM AT ALL COST
SCHOOLMASTERS ARE INDISPENSABLE
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT
THE TESTAMENT WHICH GOD MADE OUT TO ABRAHAM DID NOT CONTAIN LAWS
YOU ARE SAVED
WE DO NOT MINGLE LAW AND GRACE FAITH AND WORKS
WHEN I SPEAK OF THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
ON THE CONTRARY THE GOSPEL COMMANDS CHRISTIANS TO OBEY GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY FOR WRATH BUT ALSO FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE ROMANS 13:5 NEITHER DO THE ORDINANCES OF MOSES OR THOSE OF THE POPE CONCERN US
HENCE THE STATEMENT OF MOSES CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM IS NOT CONTRARY TO PAUL
TO BELIEVE IN GOD AS ABRAHAM DID IS TO BE RIGHT WITH GOD BECAUSE FAITH HONORS GOD
THE LAW OF MOSES DEALS WITH MUNDANE MATTERS
I AM THE LORD THY GOD WHICH HAVE BROUGHT THEE OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE
THE APOSTLE POINTEDLY ASKS THE GALATIANS WHETHER THEY DESIRE TO BE IN BONDAGE AGAIN TO THE LAW
WHILE MOSES WAS IN THE MOUNTAIN WHERE HE TALKED WITH GOD FACE TO FACE HE HAD NO LAW HE MADE NO LAW HE ADMINISTERED NO LAW
FIRST BY THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS AND THE IMPUTATION OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
I HAVE TAUGHT ADMONISHED AND REPROVED YOU ENOUGH
YOU GALATIANS HAVE NOT INJURED ME
IT SHONE WITH THE GLORY OF GOD
WHY DO GOOD WHY GIVE ALMS WHY SUFFER EVIL WHEN THERE IS NO LAW TO FORCE US TO DO SO THIS ATTITUDE IS COMMON ENOUGH
WE ARE TO SEEK GOD AS PAUL TELLS US IN I CORINTHIANS 1:23 24
AND THE SCRIPTURE FORESEEING THAT GOD WOULD JUSTIFY THE HEATHEN THROUGH FAITH
BUT WE HAVE SEEN CHRIST
THIS TEACHING FORMS ONE OF THE CHIEF ARTICLES OF THEIR FAITH
I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED THE PEOPLE TO CURTAIL THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONCEAL OR REVOKE THIS LIBERTY PROCLAIMED BY THE GOSPEL
FOR CHRIST IN WHOM WE BELIEVE IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
THE PROMISE OF THE SPIRIT IS HEBREW FOR THE PROMISED SPIRIT THE SPIRIT SPELLS FREEDOM FROM THE LAW SIN DEATH THE CURSE HELL AND THE JUDGMENT OF GOD
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO STONE MOSES TO DEATH
THE GARMENT OF ADAM MUST COME OFF LIKE SOILED CLOTHES
GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON MADE OF A WOMAN CHRIST THEREFORE IS TRUE GOD AND TRUE MAN
BY THE GRACE OF GOD WE HAVE EFFECTED HERE IN WITTENBERG THE FORM OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH
UP TO THIS POINT PAUL HAS BEEN OCCUPIED WITH THE DOCTRINAL ASPECT OF THE APOSTASY OF THE GALATIANS
THAT YE ARE SO SOON
LIKE OXEN THAT TOIL IN THE YOKE ALL DAY AND IN THE EVENING ARE TURNED OUT TO GRAZE ALONG THE DUSTY ROAD AND AT LAST ARE MARKED FOR SLAUGHTER WHEN THEY NO LONGER CAN DRAW THE BURDEN SO THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW ARE ENTANGLED WITH THE YOKE OF BONDAGE AND WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN OLD AND BROKEN-DOWN IN THE SERVICE OF THE LAW THEY HAVE EARNED FOR THEIR PERPETUAL REWARD GOD'S WRATH AND EVERLASTING TORMENT
THE APOSTLE DOES NOT SAY THAT WORKS ARE OBJECTIONABLE BUT TO BUILD ONE'S HOPES FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS ON WORKS IS DISASTROUS FOR THAT MAKES CHRIST GOOD FOR NOTHING
THIS IN TURN STIRS UP THE DEVIL BECAUSE THE GOSPEL SHOWS HIM UP FOR WHAT HE IS THE DEVIL AND NOT GOD
ACCUSTOM YOURSELF TO SEPARATE LAW AND GOSPEL EVEN IN REGARD TO TIME
YET PAUL HAD A GOOD REASON FOR ADDING IT
HE SUFFERED TO REDEEM THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW THE ROMAN CONCEPTION OF CHRIST AS A MERE LAWGIVER MORE STRINGENT THAN MOSES IS QUITE CONTRARY TO PAUL'S TEACHING
THEREFORE ALL EXPONENTS OF THE LAW AND OF WORKS DESERVE TO BE CALLED TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS
MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL PUBLIC OFFICIALS PARENTS CHILDREN MASTERS SERVANTS ETC ARE TRUE SAINTS WHEN THEY TAKE CHRIST FOR THEIR WISDOM RIGHTEOUSNESS SANCTIFICATION AND REDEMPTION AND WHEN THEY FULFILL THE DUTIES OF THEIR SEVERAL VOCATIONS ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD OF GOD'S WORD AND REPRESS THE LUST AND DESIRES OF THE FLESH BY THE SPIRIT
IF I WAS ANXIOUS TO PLEASE MEN IF I APPROVED OF CIRCUMCISION AND GOOD WORKS AS FACTORS IN OUR SALVATION IF I WOULD TAKE DELIGHT IN YOUR FLESH AS THE FALSE APOSTLES DO I WOULD NOT HAVE THESE MARKS ON MY BODY
IT WAS NO EASY TASK FOR PAUL TO REPRIMAND PETER
THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS SO VICIOUS IS SIN THAT ONLY THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST COULD ATONE FOR SIN
WE PREACHED FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST
ISAIAH 40 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
HE ADDS AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
JUST TAKE IT EASY SISTER CONSCIENCE
BUT THAT FACT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THEM
FOURTHLY THEY DIFFER IN SEQUENCE
THE FATHERS WERE NOT JUSTIFIED BY CIRCUMCISION
GOD IS THE GOD OF THE HUMBLE THE MISERABLE THE AFFLICTED
RATHER THAN TERRIFY AND CONDEMN MEN'S CONSCIENCES THEY OUGHT TO RAISE THEM UP AND COMFORT THEM WITH THE TRUTH
SIN IS ACTUALLY INCREASED AND MAGNIFIED BY THE LAW
I CAME NOT TO BRING MORE LAWS OR TO JUDGE MEN ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING LAW
REASON SHOUTS THAT ALL THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS
NEITHER ARE OUR ATTACKS UPON THE PAPACY
THE LAW IS ABOLISHED AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED WHEN IT HAS DRIVEN ME INTO THE ARMS OF CHRIST
BUT GOD IS ONE
WHY THEN SHOULD HE CALL HIMSELF THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES WHILE HE CALLS PETER THE APOSTLE OF THE CIRCUMCISION
JESUS HELD OUT THE SAME COMFORT TO HIS DISCIPLES IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF ST MATTHEW
HOLY WRIT SPEAKS OF HOPE IN TWO WAYS
THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND WISE MEN WHOM GOD USES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANKIND
FOR THOSE WHO GO ABOUT TO PLEASE MEN WE HAVE A WORD FROM CHRIST RECORDED IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF ST JOHN
CHRIST IS NOT THE MINISTER OF SIN BUT THE DISPENSER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE GIVER OF LIFE
IN CIVIL LIFE GOSPEL CONSCIENCE GRACE REMISSION OF SINS CHRIST HIMSELF DO NOT COUNT BUT ONLY MOSES WITH THE LAWBOOKS
THE SCRIPTURES EXPRESSLY STATE
THE FALSE APOSTLES SLYLY SUGGESTED THAT PAUL HAD BEEN CONSTRAINED BY THE OTHER APOSTLES TO OBSERVE THESE CEREMONIAL LAWS
IT HAPPENS AT TIMES THAT ANGER HATRED IMPATIENCE CARNAL DESIRE FEAR SORROW OR SOME OTHER LUST OF THE FLESH SO OVERWHELMS A MAN THAT HE CANNOT SHAKE THEM OFF THOUGH HE TRY EVER SO HARD
IN ATTRIBUTING TO CHRIST THE DIVINE POWER OF CREATING AND GIVING GRACE PEACE EVERLASTING LIFE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS THE CONCLUSION IS INEVITABLE THAT CHRIST IS TRULY GOD
NEVERTHELESS PAUL HELD FAST TO THE LIBERTY OF THE GOSPEL
NOW THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING US SO ODIOUS TO THOSE WHO FORMERLY LOVED US THAT THEY NOW HATE US LIKE POISON
PAUL ALWAYS KEEPS THIS TEXT BEFORE HIM
NOW HE ALSO CALLS THE PROMISE OF BLESSING THE ADOPTION OF SONS THE INHERITANCE OF EVERLASTING LIFE
SEVERAL YEARS LATER THE OLD MAN ASKS THE LAD TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM
NOBODY WANTS TO HELP OUT A BROTHER IN DISTRESS
ALL MISCHIEF BEGINS IN THE NAME OF GOD WHEN THE DEVIL SEES THAT HE CANNOT HURT THE CAUSE OF THE GOSPEL BY DESTRUCTIVE METHODS HE DOES IT UNDER THE GUISE OF CORRECTING AND ADVANCING THE CAUSE OF THE GOSPEL
THE SAME CRITICISM WHICH WAS LEVELED AT THE APOSTLES IS LEVELED AT US
HE COMFORTS THE BROKEN-HEARTED
SOME OF THE OLD SAINTS LABORED SO HARD TO ATTAIN PERFECTION THAT THEY LOST THE CAPACITY TO FEEL ANYTHING
PRINT THIS ME WITH CAPITAL LETTERS IN YOUR HEART AND DO NOT EVER DOUBT THAT YOU BELONG TO THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE MEANT BY THIS ME CHRIST DID NOT ONLY LOVE PETER AND PAUL
BUT THIS IS NOT TO BE PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
INSTEAD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE I WOULD RESTORE SIN AND DEATH BY THE GRACE OF GOD WE KNOW THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST ALONE
THIS OUGHT TO BE BORNE IN MIND PARTICULARLY BY THE MINISTERS OF THE WORD IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY NOT FORGET THE PARENTAL ATTITUDE WHICH PAUL HERE REQUIRES OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE KEEPING OF SOULS
I WILL BE ACTIVE IN THIS OR THAT CHARITABLE ENDEAVOR
BUT HE THAT TROUBLETH YOU SHALL BEAR HIS JUDGMENT WHOSOEVER HE BE
NOW VAINGLORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMMON POISON IN THE WORLD
ALL THIS GOES TO SHOW HOW LITTLE THE SCHOLASTICS KNOW ABOUT THE LAW
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BITTEN BY PRIDE USUALLY STAND UPON THE REPUTATION FOR LEARNING AND WISDOM
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED THE BLESSING WAS GIVEN UNCONDITIONALLY
ONLY THE CONFINEMENT IN THE PRISON OF THE LAW MUST NOT BE UNDULY PROLONGED
IN DECLARING THAT HIS GOSPEL IS NOT AFTER MAN PAUL DOES NOT MERELY WISH TO STATE THAT HIS GOSPEL IS NOT MUNDANE
IF GOD HAD NOT ORDERED PAUL TO JERUSALEM PAUL WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE THERE
UNLESS YOU EULOGIZE WHATEVER THEY SAY OR DO UNLESS YOU ADAPT YOURSELF TO THEIR SLIGHTEST WHIM THEY BECOME ANGRY WITH YOU
HEBREWS 11 HOPE COMES LATER AND IS BORN OF TRIBULATION
IN THE LAST ANALYSIS TO DO THE LAW MEANS TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST
EVERY GIFT BE IT SMALL OR GREAT SPIRITUAL OR TEMPORAL AND EVERY GOOD THING I SHOULD EVER DO GOD HAS ORDAINED WHILE I WAS YET IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB WHERE I COULD NEITHER THINK NOR PERFORM ANY GOOD THING
ROMANS 5 FIFTHLY THEY DIFFER IN REGARD TO THEIR EFFECTS
WHAT ELSE AM I TO THINK
GOD GAVE HIM THE POWER
AND IF A SON THEN AN HEIR OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST
THESE CRITICISMS WERE AMPLIFIED BY THE FALSE APOSTLES
SOMETHING IS LACKING IN ALL WRITING
NOT THOSE WHO LIVE A SINGLE LIFE OR MAKE A FETISH OF DAYS MEATS CLOTHES AND SUCH THINGS
IT CAN ONLY CONDEMN ACCORDING TO THE PASSAGE
LET EVERY GOVERNMENT ENACT THE BEST POSSIBLE LAWS
IN DOING SO GOD SEEMS UNJUST AND HARSH
THE FACT IS THAT CORNELIUS GAVE ALMS AND PRAYED TO GOD BECAUSE HE HAD FAITH
WHAT ELSE CAN THEY EXPECT WHEN THEY TRUST IN WORKS AND NOT IN THE WORD OF GOD
AND COMMUNICATED UNTO THEM THAT GOSPEL
ON THE OTHER HAND THE APOSTLE DECLARES THAT WITHOUT FRUITS FAITH SERVES NO PURPOSE
OUR OPPONENTS ARE NOT SATISFIED
WE HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS SO NECESSARY TO REPEAT THE ADMONITION OF THIS VERSE
REASON CANNOT PROPERLY EVALUATE THIS GIFT
IN THY WORKS THOU SHALT BE BLESSED VERSE 18
UNLESS A PERSON HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE HE HAD BETTER LEAVE ALLEGORIES ALONE
THEY WERE SUPPORTERS IN THIS CONTENTION BY THE JEWS WITH THE RESULT THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT FIRMLY ESTABLISHED IN FAITH WERE EASILY PERSUADED THAT PAUL WAS NOT A SINCERE TEACHER OF GOD BECAUSE HE IGNORED THE LAW
BUT BEFORE HE FOLLOWS UP HIS DOCTRINAL DISCOURSE WITH PRACTICAL PRECEPTS HE ONCE MORE REPROVES THE GALATIANS
WHEN GOD REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE CAIN'S WORTH CAIN GOT ANGRY AT GOD AND AT ABEL
BUT SHOW ME A PERSON WHO IS ABLE TO RENDER PERFECT OBEDIENCE
WHEN A PERSON HAS PUT ON CHRIST NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
I HAVE
IT WANTS TO BE ESTEEMED AS HIGH-CLASS RELIGION
I HAVE PREACHED THE GOSPEL TO YOU IN CONFORMITY WITH THE REVELATION WHICH I RECEIVED FROM JESUS CHRIST
PAUL CALLS IT BY GOOD WORDS AND FAIR SPEECHES TO DECEIVE THE HEARTS OF THE SIMPLE ROMANS 16:18 THEY TELL ME THAT BY MY STUBBORNNESS IN THIS DOCTRINE OF THE SACRAMENT I AM DESTROYING THE HARMONY OF THE CHURCH
IN THE NEXT CHAPTER PAUL LAYS SPECIAL STRESS UPON THE FREEDOM WHICH THE CHILDREN OF THE FREE WOMAN ENJOY
TROUBLE ME NO MORE MY SOUL
I HAVE SPENT MUCH TIME ON THIS VERSE IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE CRUEL TEACHING OF THE ROMAN CHURCH THAT A PERSON OUGHT TO BE KEPT IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING HIS STATUS WITH GOD
PAUL DESCRIBES THIS SPIRITUAL PURPOSE OF THE LAW IN THE WORDS BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSIONS I.E TO REVEAL TO A PERSON HIS SIN BLINDNESS MISERY HIS IGNORANCE HATRED AND CONTEMPT OF GOD HIS DEATH HELL AND CONDEMNATION
IT IS NOT LESS PREPOSTEROUS TO SAY THE SON OF GOD DIED THAN TO SAY THE SON OF GOD WAS A SINNER
BUT SINCE WE CANNOT OBTAIN THIS CONCESSION WE WILL GIVE IN TO NOBODY NOT TO ALL THE ANGELS IN HEAVEN NOT TO PETER NOT TO PAUL NOT TO A HUNDRED EMPERORS NOT TO A THOUSAND POPES NOT TO THE WHOLE WORLD
WHEN I BEGAN TO PROCLAIM THE GOSPEL THERE WERE MANY VERY MANY WHO WERE DELIGHTED WITH OUR DOCTRINE AND HAD A GOOD OPINION OF US
HENCE CHRIST SAID TO MARY MAGDALENE
IN THIS PASSAGE PAUL CONTENDS AGAINST THE FALSE APOSTLES FOR THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION
J
HE SAITH NOT AND TO SEEDS AS OF MANY
OTHERWISE YOU ARE MERELY THE PHYSICAL OFFSPRING OF THE PROCREATING ABRAHAM I.E YOU WERE CONCEIVED AND BORN IN SIN UNTO WRATH AND CONDEMNATION
IF THIS HAPPENED TO PAUL WHAT BUSINESS HAVE WE TO COMPLAIN WHEN PEOPLE DOUBT OUR WORDS OR HOLD US IN LITTLE REGARD WE WHO CANNOT BEGIN TO COMPARE OURSELVES WITH THE APOSTLE
WHEN IT HAD PLEASED GOD HE WRITES I DID NOT DESERVE IT
THE LAW IS LIKE THE GOOD SCHOOLMASTER WHO TRAINS HIS CHILDREN TO FIND PLEASURE IN DOING THINGS THEY FORMERLY DETESTED
IN ORDER TO HAVE FAITH YOU MUST PAINT A TRUE PORTRAIT OF CHRIST
AT ONCE HE PREACHED JESUS CHRIST IN DAMASCUS
HE GAVE THE LAW LICENSE TO ACCUSE AND CONDEMN HIM
THEY TRAIN SINNERS WHO ARE TEN TIMES WORSE THAN ANY THIEF WHORE MURDERER
3:16 AND IN THE LIKENESS OF FIRE UPON THE APOSTLES AND OTHER BELIEVERS
READ THE WORDS ME AND FOR ME WITH GREAT EMPHASIS
THIS CHARITABLE TRUST IN MAN IS NECESSARY TO LIFE
ON THE CONTRARY WE HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF MANY GOOD MEN WHO THANK GOD ON THEIR KNEES FOR THE CONSOLATION THAT OUR DOCTRINE HAS BROUGHT THEM
WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE
THUS THE APOSTLE BARS THE WAY OF HYPOCRITES TO THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST ON ALL SIDES
IT IS TO LAST ONLY UNTIL THE TIME APPOINTED OF THE FATHER UNTIL CHRIST CAME AND REDEEMED US
SARAH'S DEMAND THAT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON BE CAST OUT OF THE HOUSE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A BLOW TO ABRAHAM
THIS POINT PAUL DRIVES HOME WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BECAUSE THE JEWS ATTACHED SAVING VALUE TO THE GENEALOGICAL FACT
I HAVE PREACHED FAITH IN CHRIST TO THE GENTILES AND NOT THE LAW
CHRIST HATH REDEEMED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW BEING MADE A CURSE FOR US
THE SPIRITUAL WITCHERY OF THE DEVIL CREATES IN THE HEART A WRONG IDEA OF CHRIST
THE LAW IS NOT JUST ANOTHER SCHOOLMASTER
IT BECAME MORE TOLERABLE TO THE CONSCIENCE
WHO SHALL DELIVER ME FROM THE BODY OF THIS DEATH THE BODY OF THIS DEATH SPOILED THE JOY OF HIS SPIRIT
IF THIS WERE THE ONLY ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT SALVATION IS NOT BY THE LAW THIS ONE BIBLE HISTORY WOULD DO THE WORK
I WOULD HAVE SAID TO MYSELF
FOR THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH
PAUL CHRIST'S APOSTLE DECLARES THAT CHRIST HATH REDEEMED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW BEING MADE A CURSE FOR US GAL
GOD WILL SANCTION MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND REWARD ME WITH EVERLASTING LIFE
HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER
TO PARAPHRASE HIM
IF SALVATION IS NOT A MATTER OF DOING WHY SHOULD WE DO ANYTHING FOR THE POOR IN THIS CRUDE MANNER THEY TURN THE LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT INTO WANTONNESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS
I WHO HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED FROM ABOVE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO YOU
BUT BECAUSE GOD IS GOOD AND JUST IT IS NO MORE THAN RIGHT THEY SAY THAT HE SHOULD REWARD A GOOD WORK BY GRANTING GRACE FOR THE SERVICE
THIS IS OUR DAILY EXPERIENCE
TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE
FOR OUR ENCOURAGEMENT HE ADDS THE PROMISE
THEY GO WHERE THE GOSPEL HAS A HOLD SO THAT THEY MAY NOT ENDANGER THEIR LIVES
THE SCHOLASTICS GRANT THAT ACCORDING TO THE REASONABLE ORDER OF NATURE BEING PRECEDES DOING
NOW HE BEWITCHES PEOPLE IN A WORSE WAY WITH SPIRITUAL SORCERY
THIS SORT OF THING MAKES ME SO IMPATIENT AT TIMES THAT I WISH THE SWINE WHO TRAMPLED PRECIOUS PEARLS UNDER FOOT WERE BACK ONCE AGAIN UNDER THE TYRANNY OF THE POPE
22:7 I SAY TO VALUE THIS POOR CHRIST SO SPITEFULLY SCORNED SPIT UPON SCOURGED AND CRUCIFIED MORE THAN THE RICHES OF THE RICHEST THE STRENGTH OF THE STRONGEST THE WISDOM OF THE WISEST IS SOMETHING
THE LAW HAD TO CHANGE ITS FACE AND VOICE
WHEREFORE THEN SERVETH THE LAW
THIS WILL GIVE THE LIE TO THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT WE CHRISTIANS ARE THE ENEMIES OF DECENCY AND OF PUBLIC PEACE
OUR LOVE HOWEVER IS FAULTY
THAT WE MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH
IN FACT I AM AN APOSTLE ELSEWHERE PAUL DRAWS A SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN AN APOSTLESHIP AND LESSER FUNCTIONS AS IN I CORINTHIANS 12:28
IT WAS HIS FAVORITE AMONG ALL THE BIBLICAL BOOKS
THE MAN THAT DOETH THEM SHALL LIVE IN THEM BUT WHERE IS THE PERSON WHO CAN DO THEM I.E LOVE GOD WITH ALL HIS HEART SOUL AND MIND AND HIS NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF
AS LONG AS A PERSON IS NOT A MURDERER ADULTERER THIEF HE WOULD SWEAR THAT HE IS RIGHTEOUS
BUT HE HAS THE SPIRITUAL AND HEAVENLY JERUSALEM IN MIND NOT THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM
HE THAT DESPISETH YOU DESPISETH ME LUKE 10:16 TO SAMUEL GOD SAID
BUT WE WHO ENDEAVOR TO PLEASE GOD AND NOT MEN STIR UP HELL ITSELF
THEY QUOTE PAUL'S OWN STATEMENT IN ROMANS 2:13 THE DOERS OF THE LAW SHALL BE JUSTIFIED VERY WELL
THIS SAME ARGUMENT IS USED BY THE PAPACY
NONE WHATEVER
WE WANT IT UNDERSTOOD THAT WE DO NOT REJECT THE LAW AS OUR OPPONENTS CLAIM
HOW ABOUT THE MONKS
EVEN BEFORE THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM JEWS DWELT HERE AND THERE IN THE CITIES OF THE GENTILES
IT TELLS ME NOT WHAT I MUST DO BUT WHAT JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD HAS DONE FOR ME
HE IS THE FORGIVER OF SINS
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAW CRIES PAUL
NO LAW-WORKER CAN EVER UNDERSTAND THEM
I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD HE SAYS
PAUL DEPLORES THE FACT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE MIND TO RETAIN A SOUND AND STEADFAST FAITH
BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURDENS AND SO FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST
THERE IS NO DANGER CONNECTED WITH A REFUSAL OF MEATS FOR THE SAKE OF CHARITY
YET THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT PROCEED FROM THE FLESH BUT FROM GOD A CHRISTIAN USES EARTHLY MEANS LIKE ANY UNBELIEVER
SUCH STRICKEN CONSCIENCES MUST BE COMFORTED AND SET STRAIGHT AS PAUL CORRECTED THE GALATIANS BY SHOWING THEM THAT THEIR OPINION IS NOT OF CHRIST BECAUSE IT RUNS COUNTER TO THE GOSPEL WHICH DESCRIBES CHRIST AS A MEEK AND MERCIFUL SAVIOR
LET NO MAN THINK THAT ONCE HE HAS RECEIVED FAITH HE CAN PRESENTLY BE CONVERTED INTO A FAULTLESS CREATURE
THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL ARE CONTRARY IDEAS
NOT THAT PAUL HIMSELF EVER THOUGHT HE HAD RUN IN VAIN
LET A MINISTER BE FAITHFUL IN HIS OFFICE IS THE APOSTOLIC INJUNCTION
AND THAT ROCK WAS CHRIST I COR
BY MY FAITH IN CHRIST I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
THE HEART OF MAN FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A TREASURE AS THE HOLY GHOST IS GOTTEN BY THE MERE HEARING OF FAITH
ISAIAH DECLARES OF CHRIST
ALTHOUGH THE FLESH IS STILL ALIVE IT CANNOT VERY WELL ACT UPON ITS DESIRES BECAUSE IT IS BOUND AND NAILED TO THE CROSS
WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN JEROME RAISES THE QUESTION WHY PAUL CALLED THEM CHURCHES THAT WERE NO CHURCHES INASMUCH AS THE GALATIANS HAD FORSAKEN THE GRACE OF CHRIST FOR THE LAW OF MOSES
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SINNERS WERE TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BEFORE THE RIGHTEOUS THE JEWS WERE VERY MUCH PUT OUT
BUT AS THAT HE THAT WAS BORN AFTER THE FLESH PERSECUTED HIM THAT WAS BORN AFTER THE SPIRIT EVEN SO IT IS NOW
HE DID NOT WANT TO OFFEND THEM
FOR WE KNOW NOT WHAT WE SHOULD PRAY FOR AS WE OUGHT
2:15 THEY CANNOT HARM THOSE WHO HIDE IN CHRIST
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CHASED FROM HIS OWN COUNTRY
HENCE WE ARE ONLY PARTLY FREE FROM THE LAW
IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE GOSPEL OF ST JOHN JESUS DECLARES
IN THIS VERSE PAUL EXPRESSES HIS HATRED OF THE WORLD
EITHER WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST OR WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
NOW THE APOSTLE ALSO ADDRESSES THE HEARERS OF THE WORD REQUESTING THEM TO BESTOW ALL GOOD THINGS UPON THOSE WHO HAVE TAUGHT THEM THE GOSPEL
WHETHER REASON HEARS THAT JUSTIFICATION BEFORE GOD IS OBTAINED BY GRACE ALONE IT DRAWS THE INFERENCE THAT THE LAW IS WITHOUT VALUE
WE ARE COMPANIONS IN DOCTRINE
LATER ON PAUL ENUMERATES AMONG THE WORKS OF THE FLESH EVEN IDOLATRY AND HERESY
SPEAKING NOW OF THE MOSAIC LAW PAUL DECLARES THAT HE WAS WRAPPED UP IN IT
BROTHER SAUL THE LORD EVEN JESUS THAT APPEARED UNTO THEE IN THE WAY AS THOU CAMEST HATH SENT ME THAT THOU MIGHTEST RECEIVE THY SIGHT AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST PAUL DID NOT RECEIVE INSTRUCTION FROM ANANIAS
THINK WHAT GRACE RIGHTEOUSNESS LIFE PEACE AND SALVATION THERE IS IN ME THANKS TO THAT INSEPARABLE CONJUNCTION BETWEEN CHRIST AND ME THROUGH FAITH
YOU ARE NOW A LABORING ASS
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PURPOSE
IT IS REALLY KIND OF GOD TO SEND SO MUCH INFAMY REPROACH HATRED AND CURSING OUR WAY TO KEEP US FROM GETTING PROUD OF THE GIFTS OF GOD IN US
THE CONCLUSION IS INEVITABLE
NOW NO CHASTENING FOR THE PRESENT SEEMETH TO BE JOYOUS BUT GRIEVOUS
FOR THAT THE LAW IS INTENDED
PAUL ADDUCES HIS OWN CASE FOR AN EXAMPLE
FOR THIS AGAR IS MOUNT SINAI IN ARABIA
BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY THE FIRST-FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT AND NOT THE TENTH-FRUITS WE DO NOT OBSERVE THE LAW PERFECTLY
THEY ARE SAVING NOBODY
WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE
WHEN IT BEGINS TO SHINE A LITTLE HE FIGHTS AGAINST IT WITH MIGHT AND MAIN
THE GOSPEL IS TO AGGRANDIZE CHRIST AND THE MERCY OF GOD
WE WOULD NOT BE SO CAREFUL ABOUT THIS LIFE
THEY MAY THINK ABOUT GOD CHRIST AND HEAVENLY THINGS BUT THEY DO IT AFTER THEIR OWN FASHION AND NOT AFTER THE WORD OF GOD
PERSONALLY HE DID NOT DESERVE TO BE HANGED FOR ANY CRIME OF HIS OWN DOING
WE MAY UNDERSTAND PAUL TO SAY WE WAIT IN SPIRIT THROUGH FAITH FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT WE HOPE FOR WHICH IN DUE TIME WILL BE REVEALED TO US OR WE MAY UNDERSTAND PAUL TO SAY
I CANNOT ALWAYS APPREHEND CHRIST AS THE SCRIPTURES PORTRAY HIM
WITH THIS PURPOSE IN HIS MIND HE SPEAKS VERY GENTLY TO THEM
THIS PROMISE SAYS PAUL IS NOT OBTAINED BY ANY MERIT BY ANY LAW OR BY ANY WORK
THIS SENTENCE FORMS A CLEAR REJECTION OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW AND A CONFIRMATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION
TAKE THE TALENTS OF WISDOM AND INTEGRITY
THEY WILL PERVERT WORDS SPOKEN FROM A SINCERE HEART AND TWIST THEM TO MEAN JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO CONVEY
FOR HE THAT WROUGHT EFFECTUALLY IN PETER
WE GLORY IN TRIBULATIONS
A BELIEVER HAS THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL NOT PERMIT A PERSON TO REMAIN IDLE BUT WILL PUT HIM TO WORK AND STIR HIM UP TO THE LOVE OF GOD TO PATIENT SUFFERING IN AFFLICTION TO PRAYER THANKSGIVING TO THE HABIT OF CHARITY TOWARDS ALL MEN
ST JOHN BEARS WITNESS TO THIS IN HIS GOSPEL
THUS CHRIST BANISHED THE LAW FROM THE CONSCIENCE
THE SCHOLASTICS THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL AND CEREMONIAL LAWS OF MOSES WERE ABOLISHED BY THE COMING OF CHRIST BUT NOT THE MORAL LAW
THEY ARE NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN CIRCUMCISION
IF I COULD BY WORK OR MERIT LOVE THE SON OF GOD AND COME TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE HAVE SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR ME
NOT IN THIS WAY THAT HE REPLACED THE OLD LAW WITH NEW LAWS
NOW THE THINGS WHICH I WRITE UNTO YOU BEHOLD BEFORE GOD I LIE NOT
I BELIEVE THAT CHRIST MY LORD HAS REDEEMED ME FROM ALL MY SINS AND INVESTED ME WITH HIS OWN ETERNAL RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS
CHRIST DOMICILING IN ME THE OLD ADAM HAS TO STAY OUTSIDE AND REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE LAW
FOR AS MANY AS ARE OF THE WORKS OF THE LAW ARE UNDER THE CURSE AGAIN IN THE PASSAGE WHICH THE APOSTLE QUOTES FROM DEUTERONOMY 27:26 CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM THIS PASSAGE CLEARLY SUBMITS ALL MEN TO THE CURSE NOT ONLY THOSE WHO SIN OPENLY AGAINST THE LAW BUT ALSO THOSE WHO SINCERELY ENDEAVOR TO PERFORM THE LAW INCLUSIVE OF MONKS FRIARS HERMITS ETC
FOR THE INVISIBLE THINGS OF HIM FROM THE CREATION OF THE WORLD ARE CLEARLY SEEN ROMANS 1:19 20 FURTHERMORE THE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS TO BE FOUND AMONG ALL NATIONS AT ALL TIMES BEAR WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT ALL MEN HAVE A CERTAIN INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD
GOD FORBID THAT WE SHOULD SIT IN HASTY JUDGMENT ON THOSE WHO ARE WEAK IN FAITH AND LIFE AS LONG AS THEY LOVE THE WORD OF GOD AND MAKE USE OF THE SUPPER OF THE LORD
10:12 IF DAVID WHO WAS A HERO OF FAITH AND DID SO MANY GREAT THINGS FOR THE LORD COULD FALL SO BADLY THAT IN SPITE OF HIS ADVANCED AGE HE WAS OVERCOME BY YOUTHFUL LUST AFTER HE HAD WITHSTOOD SO MANY DIFFERENT TEMPTATIONS WITH WHICH THE LORD HAD TESTED HIS FAITH WHO ARE WE TO THINK THAT WE ARE MORE STABLE
YOUR BOASTING DOES NOT GET YOU ANYWHERE SAYS PAUL TO THE GALATIANS BECAUSE THE SACRED SCRIPTURES FORESAW AND FORETOLD LONG BEFORE THE LAW WAS EVER GIVEN THAT THE HEATHEN SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED BY THE BLESSED SEED OF ABRAHAM AND NOT BY THE LAW
NEVERTHELESS THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
HE FELT SORRY FOR HIS SON ISHMAEL
THE TRUE GOD HAS THIS TO SAY
WE CAN HEAR THE APOSTLE SAYING TO HIMSELF
BUT WHEN THE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT JUSTIFICATION THEN IS NO TIME TO DRAG IN THE LAW
THIS WILL GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE EXCELLENCE OF FAITH
IF WE HAD TO FEEL THAT THE SUCCESS OF OUR MINISTRY DEPENDED UPON OUR POPULARITY WITH MEN WE WOULD DIE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT POPULAR
PAUL HAD THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS GIVEN UNTO HIM THE MESSENGER OF SATAN TO BUFFET HIM IN ORDER THAT HE SHOULD NOT COME TO EXALT HIMSELF BECAUSE OF THE GRANDEUR OF HIS REVELATIONS
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GAIN PEACE OF CONSCIENCE BY THE METHODS AND MEANS OF THE WORLD
LET US BE WARNED
CAST OUT THE BONDWOMAN AND HER SON
CHAPTER 4 VERSE 1
PAUL'S ARGUMENTATION RUNS LIKE THIS
THE WHOLE CHURCH PRAYS FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND CONFESSES THAT IT BELIEVES IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS
CHAPTER 3 VERSE 1
THE LORD SHALL HAVE THEM IN DERISION PSALM 2:4 LET THEM CRY OUT AGAINST US AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE
GOD FORBID
GOD FORBID
GOD FORBID
GOD FORBID
BUT IF WE ABIDE IN THE TRUE DOCTRINE AND WALK IN THE SPIRIT WE HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
IN CIVIL AFFAIRS AN OFFICIAL HAS TO OVERLOOK MUCH IF HE IS FIT TO RULE
IT STILL RAISES ITS VOICE IN CONDEMNATION
PEOPLE BECOME SHIFTLESS AND WILL DO NO GOOD AT ALL
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN NEITHER BY MAN BUT BY JESUS CHRIST AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD ST PAUL WROTE THIS EPISTLE BECAUSE AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE GALATIAN CHURCHES JEWISH-CHRISTIAN FANATICS MOVED IN WHO PERVERTED PAUL'S GOSPEL OF MAN'S FREE JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
WITH THE WORDS ABRAHAM BELIEVED PAUL DESCRIBES A SPIRITUAL ABRAHAM RENEWED BY FAITH AND REGENERATED BY THE HOLY GHOST THAT HE SHOULD BE THE SPIRITUAL FATHER OF MANY NATIONS
THE FALSE APOSTLES PREACHED A CONDITIONAL GOSPEL
IF I EXAMINE MYSELF I FIND ENOUGH UNHOLINESS TO SHOCK ME
MY NEIGHBOR IS EVERY PERSON ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO NEED MY HELP AS CHRIST EXPLAINED IN THE TENTH CHAPTER OF LUKE
I DO NOT DESPAIR OF ALL HOPE FOR YOU
HENCE THESE EVILS ARE CRUCIFIED AND DEAD UNTO ME
BECAUSE PAUL KNEW THAT THE VAINGLORY OF THE FALSE APOSTLES HAD CAUSED THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA ENDLESS TROUBLE HE MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS TO SUPPRESS THIS ABOMINABLE VICE
FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF PRIDE WE NEED THE STRENGTH OF PRAYER
A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENETH THE WHOLE LUMP SMALL FAULTS GROW INTO BIG FAULTS
THEY THINK PAUL'S USE OF THE TERM TOO WIDE AND GENERAL
AS A RESULT THEY PERVERT THE GOSPEL
AND GOD'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS IMPERFECT FAITH OF OURS FOR PERFECT RIGHTEOUSNESS
OTHERS OF THE GALATIANS PERHAPS SAW NO HARM IN DEVIATING A TRIFLE FROM THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION AND FAITH
HE NOW CALLS THEM LOVINGLY HIS LITTLE CHILDREN
NEVERTHELESS I LIVE
DO YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT THESE REACTIONS DID NOT WORRY THE APOSTLES
THAT GOSPEL IS MORE EXCELLENT THAN ALL APOSTLES VERSE 6
IF THEY COULD SEE EVIL ROOTED IN THE NATURE OF MAN THEY WOULD NEVER ENTERTAIN SUCH SILLY DREAMS ABOUT MAN'S MERIT OR WORTHINESS
HE FELL YESTERDAY
6:5 STREWING MERCY UNTO THOUSANDS OF THEM THAT LOVE ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS EXODUS 20:6 ON THESE TWO COMMANDMENTS HANG ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS MATT
THE PRONOUN OUR REFERS TO BOTH GOD AND FATHER
AND NOW
THE TRUE GOD HAS NEVER YET SMILED UPON A PERSON FOR HIS CHARITY OR VIRTUES BUT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS
BROTHERS BORN AND LIVING TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER
HE IS THE LAMB OF GOD WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD JOHN 1:29 VERSE 16
AS SERVANTS THEY CANNOT HAVE A SHARE IN THE INHERITANCE BUT ARE DRIVEN FROM THE HOUSE AS ISHMAEL WAS CAST OUT OF THE HOUSE OF ABRAHAM
LET THEM GLORY IN THE FLESH IF THEY WISH AND LET THEM PERISH IN THEIR GLORY
NOT AS THOUGH REASON EVER YIELDS MEEKLY
SOME SECULAR WRITERS PUT PAUL'S BOASTING DOWN AS CARNAL PRIDE
IF THEIR ZEAL WERE RIGHT THEY WOULD NOT MIND YOUR LOVING ME
FOR THE DESOLATE HATH MANY MORE CHILDREN THAN SHE WHICH HATH AN HUSBAND
THEY KNEW THAT THEY OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN AND THAT IT WAS BETTER FOR THE WORLD TO BE UPSET THAN TO BE IGNORANT OF CHRIST
OUR OPPONENTS DO NOT DEFEND THEIR OWN MORAL DELINQUENCY
BY THIS CONFERENCE HE HOPED TO ESTABLISH THE IDENTITY OF HIS GOSPEL WITH THAT OF THE OTHER APOSTLES TO STOP THE TALK OF HIS OPPONENTS THAT HE HAD BEEN RUNNING AROUND IN VAIN
IN SEPARATING CHRIST FROM US SINNERS AND HOLDING HIM UP AS A HOLY EXEMPLAR ERRORISTS ROB US OF OUR BEST COMFORT
LOVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO MENTION ONLY THE SINGLE FRUIT OF LOVE FOR LOVE EMBRACES ALL THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT
DID GOD CALL ME ON ACCOUNT OF MY HOLY LIFE
HE THAT BELIEVETH IN THE SON OF GOD HATH EVERLASTING LIFE
HOW THEN COULD GOD SAY THAT MOSES WAS CRYING TO HIM
THEREFORE OUR LIBERTY IS SURE AND VALID AS LONG AS WE BELIEVE IN CHRIST
BUT LISTEN TO THE GLAD TIDINGS WHICH THE HOLY GHOST BRINGS TO YOU IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET
HOW MUCH HAPPIER YOU USED TO BE
HOWEVER MOSES MEDIATION CONSISTED ONLY IN CHANGING THE TONE OF THE LAW TO MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE TO THE PEOPLE
FOR NEITHER THEY THEMSELVES WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED KEEP THE LAW
BUT IT IS GOOD TO BE ZEALOUSLY AFFECTED ALWAYS IN A GOOD THING AND NOT ONLY WHEN I AM PRESENT WITH YOU
IN THEIR IGNORANCE THE PAPISTS SPOUT ABOUT MAN'S GOOD WILL AND RIGHT JUDGMENT AND MAN'S CAPACITY TO PERFORM THE LAW OF GOD
OF WHOM I TRAVAIL IN BIRTH AGAIN AS PARENTS REPRODUCE THEIR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THEIR CHILDREN SO THE APOSTLES REPRODUCED THEIR FAITH IN THE HEARTS OF THE HEARERS UNTIL CHRIST WAS FORMED IN THEM
IF WE LOSE THIS ARTICLE WE SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO COMBAT ERRORS OR SECTS
THEY ARE SLAVES TO THE LAW SIN AND DEATH
IT IS ONE AND THE SAME THING WHETHER A PERSON REVERTS TO THE LAW OR TO THE WORSHIP OF IDOLS
IT NEVER YIELDS
ANY PERSON WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR I SHOULD THINK THAT HE HAS A GRACIOUS GOD WHO SHOWS MERCY UNTO THOUSANDS
EVEN SO WE WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN WERE IN BONDAGE UNDER THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD
JEROME AND THE OTHER DIAGNOSTICIANS LIVED AT A TIME WHEN THE CHURCH ENJOYED PEACE AND PROSPERITY WHEN THE BISHOPS INCREASED IN WEALTH AND STANDING WHEN PASTORS AND BISHOPS NO LONGER SAT OVER THE WORD OF GOD
THE SPIRIT CRIES IN US BECAUSE OF OUR WEAKNESS
ON THE CONTRARY IF WE PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE LAW THE PROMISES OF GOD WILL BE SLOWED UP
TO REFRAIN FROM MEATS FOR THIS LATTER REASON AMOUNTS TO A DENIAL OF CHRIST
HERE THE APOSTLE BRIEFLY COMPARES THE TWO MEDIATORS
PAUL STANDS ALONE
THE LAW IS TRULY OBSERVED ONLY THROUGH FAITH
IF SATAN WERE NOT CONTINUALLY MOLESTING US WITH TRIALS WITH THE PERSECUTION OF OUR ENEMIES AND THE INGRATITUDE OF OUR BRETHREN WE WOULD BECOME SO CARELESS AND INDIFFERENT TO ALL GOOD WORKS THAT IN TIME WE WOULD LOSE OUR FAITH IN CHRIST RESIGN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD AND LOOK FOR AN EASIER LIFE
THEIRS IS A THREEFOLD SIN
BY TEACHING THAT BESIDES CHRIST AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW IS NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION THEY PUT THE LAW IN THE PLACE OF CHRIST THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THE LAW THE POWER TO SAVE A POWER THAT BELONGS TO CHRIST ONLY THE PAPISTS QUOTE THE WORDS OF CHRIST
SHOULD THEY EVER BE OVERTAKEN BY ANY SIN THE MERCY OF GOD SUPPORTS THEM
LET HIM DESIRE TO DO GOOD WORK AND TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IN ALL ITS PURITY
NO WONDER PAUL EMPLOYS SUCH SHARP LANGUAGE IN HIS EFFORT TO RECALL THE GALATIANS FROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
WE ARE THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST I COR
NO NO
THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO NEED YOUR HELP VERSE 15
HE TURNS THE NEGATIVE STATEMENT CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM INTO A POSITIVE STATEMENT AS MANY AS ARE OF THE WORKS OF THE LAW ARE UNDER THE CURSE THESE TWO STATEMENTS ONE BY PAUL AND THE OTHER BY MOSES APPEAR TO CONFLICT
WITHOUT THE WORD I COULD NOT HAVE HELPED MYSELF AGAINST THE FLESH
BUT THEY ADD THE CONDITIONAL CLAUSE THAT FAITH CAN SAVE ONLY WHEN IT IS FURNISHED WITH GOOD WORKS
THE TRUE WAY OF SALVATION IS THIS
THE CRITICISM IS IMPLIED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER A LITTLE MORE SETTLED IN THEIR BELIEFS
NEITHER IS IT MEANT FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN SIN
HE PUTS ON WHITE TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL OF LIGHT
I GLADLY HEAR READ SING AND WRITE OF HIM
BY FAITH WE BEGIN BY HOPE WE CONTINUE
REMEMBER WHAT PAUL SAYS THAT THE WORLD WITH ALL ITS WISDOM MIGHT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IS THE DEVIL'S OWN
THIS IS THE MAIN POINT OF PAUL'S ARGUMENT AGAINST THE JEWS
THERE IS A LAW OF COURSE BUT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE WHO BEAR THESE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO LOOK TO THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS I THINK YOU SHOULD BE TOLD THAT ALL YOUR PAST TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD AND ALL THE AFFLICTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ENDURED FOR CHRIST'S SAKE ARE GOING TO HELP YOU NOT AT ALL
THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PERISHED OR IN CASE THEY HAD ESCAPED THEY WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF ANOTHER MEDIATOR TO PRESERVE THEM ALIVE AND TO KEEP THE LAW IN FORCE
LET IT STAND
I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE AT PEACE WITH THE POPE THE BISHOPS THE PRINCES AND THE SECTARIANS UNLESS THEY CONSENT TO OUR DOCTRINE
WHERE CHRIST AND FAITH ARE LACKING THERE IS NO REMISSION OR COVERING OF SINS BUT ONLY CONDEMNATION
CHRIST SAYS PAUL HAS DELIVERED US FROM THIS WICKED KINGDOM OF THE DEVIL AND THE WORLD ACCORDING TO THE GOOD WILL THE PLEASURE AND COMMANDMENT OF THE FATHER
YOU WILL ANSWER
WHAT RIGHT THEN HAS THE LAW TO ACCUSE ME OR TO HOLD ANYTHING AGAINST ME
FURTHERMORE THE DISCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL ARE NOT ALL DEPENDABLE
THE GOSPEL CONVEYS TO US THE INESTIMABLE TREASURES OF GOD
THIS PASSAGE ADDUCES FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES DEFAMED PAUL AS AN IMPERFECT APOSTLE AND A WEAK AND ERRONEOUS PREACHER
YEA THEY WOULD EXCLUDE YOU THAT YE MIGHT AFFECT THEM
THE OPINIONS OF THE PAPISTS ARE THE INTELLECTUAL PIPE-DREAMS OF IDLE PATES THAT SERVE NO OTHER PURPOSE BUT TO DRAW MEN AWAY FROM THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD
SO DEEPLY HAS THE DISEASED OPINION THAT CHRIST IS A LAWGIVER SUNK INTO MY BONES
NOT CONTENT TO SPOIL THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST HE HAS FILLED THE WORLD WITH HIS CURSED TRADITIONS E.G HIS BULLS AND INDULGENCES
THEREFORE GOD INSTITUTED GOVERNMENTS PARENTS LAWS RESTRICTIONS AND CIVIL ORDINANCES
WE CANNOT SEE IT
THE CHARACTER AND LIMITATIONS OF THE LAW MUST BE RIGIDLY MAINTAINED
FOR ALL THE LAW IS FULFILLED IN ONE WORD EVEN IN THIS THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF
HAVING BEGUN IN THE SPIRIT ARE YE NOW MADE PERFECT BY THE FLESH
ST AUGUSTINE'S OPINION IS WELL TAKEN
WHEN I BID YOU TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER THIS IS WHAT I MEAN AND REQUIRE WALK IN THE SPIRIT I KNOW VERY WELL YOU WILL NOT FULFILL THE LAW BECAUSE YOU ARE SINNERS AS LONG AS YOU LIVE
CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WAS GIVEN NOT FOR THE RIGHTEOUS BUT FOR SINNERS
THEREFORE HE WITHSTOOD PETER TO HIS FACE
THE BELIEVER TOO WORKS BUT NOT IN AN EFFORT TO BECOME A SON AND AN HEIR OF GOD
CURSED IS EVERY ONE THAT CONTINUETH NOT IN ALL THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW TO DO THEM PAUL HAS GOOD REASON FOR CALLING THE MINISTER OF THE LAW THE MINISTER OF SIN FOR THE LAW REVEALS OUR SINFULNESS
THEY MAKE A PERSON STRONG AND COURAGEOUS TO BEAR AND TO OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES EVEN DEATH ITSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VICTORY OF CHRIST'S DEATH AND THE ASSURANCE OF THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS
A NEW COMMANDMENT I GIVE UNTO YOU THAT YE LOVE ONE ANOTHER TO LOVE MEANS TO BEAR ANOTHER'S BURDENS
THAT IS ALL
I WOULD RATHER THAT I MY BRETHREN YES THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN BE ANATHEMATIZED THAN THAT MY GOSPEL BE OVERTHROWN THE GREEK WORD ANATHEMA HEBREW HEREM MEANS TO ACCURSE EXECRATE TO DAMN
MANY EMBRACE THE GOSPEL TODAY AND TOMORROW DISCARD IT
PAUL MIGHT HAVE DISMISSED PETER'S ERROR AS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE
FAITH IS FEEBLE BECAUSE THE FLESH WARS AGAINST THE SPIRIT
THE LAW FOUND HIM AMONG SINNERS
BUT IT WAS INCIDENTAL
YOU THEN SERVED IDOLS THAT WERE NO GODS
IF THE LAW WAS NOT GIVEN FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS OR SALVATION WHY WAS IT GIVEN
TO CONVINCE THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA THAT HIS GOSPEL WAS THE TRUE WORD OF CHRIST WHICH HE LEARNED FROM CHRIST HIMSELF AND FROM NO MAN
THE NAME AND DOCTRINE OF PAUL BECAME OBNOXIOUS TO THEM
IN ORDER TO AVOID THE APPEARANCE AS IF CHRISTIANITY MILITATED AGAINST GOOD WORKS OR OPPOSED CIVIL GOVERNMENT THE APOSTLE ALSO URGES US TO GIVE OURSELVES UNTO GOOD WORKS TO LEAD AN HONEST LIFE AND TO KEEP FAITH AND LOVE WITH ONE ANOTHER
THEY GRANT THAT WE HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION IN CHRIST BUT CLAIM THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO GO THROUGH WITH THE BUILDING
FURIOUSLY THE SIN OF THE WORLD ASSAILED THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
REVERSELY WHAT AN AWFUL THING IT MUST BE FOR THE CONSCIENCE IF ONE IS NOT PROPERLY CALLED
THERE IS NONE THAT UNDERSTANDETH GOD ROMANS 3:11 AGAIN NO MAN HATH SEEN GOD JOHN 1:18 NOW WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO YOU IF YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU OR WHAT HE WANTS OF YOU
THEY CANNOT DO IT
4:4 THE NEFARIOUS OPINION OF THE PAPISTS WHICH ATTRIBUTES THE MERIT OF GRACE AND THE REMISSION OF SINS TO WORKS MUST HERE BE EMPHATICALLY REJECTED
BUT SINCE WE ARE EXPLAINING THIS EPISTLE YOU WILL NOT MIND IF WE REPEAT WHAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN EXPLAINED ELSEWHERE
YOU CANNOT WAKE UP THE PEOPLE OF GOMORRAH WITH THE GOSPEL OF PEACE
THE GALATIANS MIGHT SAY
THE TRUE DOERS OF THE LAW ARE THOSE WHO ARE MOVED BY FAITH IN CHRIST TO DO THE LAW
PAUL REITERATES THAT PETER JAMES AND JOHN THE ACCEPTED PILLARS OF THE CHURCH TAUGHT HIM NOTHING NOR DID THEY COMMIT UNTO HIM THE OFFICE OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL UNTO THE GENTILES
IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WE OBTAIN THE ETERNAL GIFTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS RESURRECTION AND EVERLASTING LIFE
CIRCUMSTANCES PERSONAL WORTH CHARACTER ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE NO BEARING UPON JUSTIFICATION
SECONDLY BY THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT CHRISTIAN LIBERTY EXEMPTS A CHRISTIAN FROM THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
IN THIS MANNER EVERY CHRISTIAN PASTOR IS A SPIRITUAL FATHER WHO FORMS CHRIST IN THE HEARTS OF HIS HEARERS
HE FORESAW THIS CONFUSION OF THE PROMISE AND THE LAW CREEPING INTO THE CHURCH
FOR THE SON OF THE BONDWOMAN SHALL NOT BE HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN
WE MUST NOT DRAG GOOD WORKS INTO THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION AS THE MONKS DO WHO MAINTAIN THAT NOT ONLY GOOD WORKS BUT ALSO THE PUNISHMENT WHICH EVILDOERS SUFFER FOR THEIR WICKED DEEDS DESERVE EVERLASTING LIFE
THE LAW WAS MEANT TO CONFIRM THE PROMISE UNTIL THE TIME SHOULD COME WHEN GOD WOULD OPEN HIS TESTAMENT IN THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST
THE SPIRIT HELPETH OUR INFIRMITIES AND MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US WITH GROANINGS WHICH CANNOT BE UTTERED WE NEED THE HELP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BECAUSE WE ARE WEAK AND INFIRM
WITH ITS LASHINGS IT IS ONLY TOO ANXIOUS TO DRIVE US TO CHRIST
ST BERNARD WAS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE MEDIEVAL SAINTS
SINCE CHRIST HAS DISPLACED THE LAW WHICH COMMANDS CHARITY IT FOLLOWS THAT CHARITY HAS BEEN ABROGATED WITH THE LAW AS A FACTOR IN OUR JUSTIFICATION AND ONLY FAITH IS LEFT
BUT HE DOES NOT OPENLY CONDEMN THEM FOR FEAR THAT OVERSHARP CRITICISM MIGHT ALIENATE THEM ALTOGETHER
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO JUSTIFICATION I SAY WE MUST CONCENTRATE UPON CHRIST ALONE OR ELSE WE MAKE HIM NON-EFFECTIVE
THOSE WHO REFUSE TO BE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST ARE IDOLATERS
THEY WHICH ARE OF FAITH THE SAME ARE THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM ABRAHAM WAS THE FATHER OF THE FAITHFUL
AND HE COUNTED IT TO HIM FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS THE APOSTLE MAKES THE MOST OF THIS PASSAGE
BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHICH GIVETH US THE VICTORY THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST LET US SEE HOW CHRIST WAS ABLE TO GAIN THE VICTORY OVER OUR ENEMIES
WHEN THE LAW DRIVES YOU TO THE POINT OF DESPAIR LET IT DRIVE YOU A LITTLE FARTHER LET IT DRIVE YOU STRAIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF JESUS WHO SAYS
FAITH ALONE BUILDS ON THE PROMISES OF GOD AS PAUL SAYS IN THIS VERSE
YET THE LAW TREATED THIS INNOCENT JUST AND BLESSED LAMB OF GOD AS CRUELLY AS IT TREATED US
IT ACCUSED HIM OF BLASPHEMY AND TREASON
LET THE WORD OF GOD ABIDE FOREVER
I AM SORRY TO HEAR OF YOUR TROUBLES AND DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FOR THE DISGRACEFUL PART YOU PLAYED I SAY RATHER MUCH ON THIS POINT TO SAVE PAUL FROM THE CHARGE THAT HE RAILED UPON THE CHURCHES CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL
WHEN I WAS A CHILD THERE WERE MANY WITCHES AND SORCERERS AROUND WHO BEWITCHED CATTLE AND PEOPLE PARTICULARLY CHILDREN AND DID MUCH HARM
SEE GOD HAS RESPECT TO OFFERINGS
AND THIS I SAY THAT THE COVENANT THAT WAS CONFIRMED BEFORE OF GOD IN CHRIST THE LAW WHICH WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER CANNOT DISANNUL THAT IT SHOULD MAKE THE PROMISE OF NONE EFFECT
A SON IS AN HEIR NOT BY VIRTUE OF HIGH ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT BY VIRTUE OF HIS BIRTH
BUT OTHER OF THE APOSTLES SAW I NONE SAVE JAMES THE LORD'S BROTHER
I DO NOT MEAN TO DISCOURAGE YOU ALTOGETHER
I WOULD HAVE FELT I HAD DONE GOD A REAL SERVICE
I HAD BLASPHEMED HIS GOSPEL
WHEN CAIN WAS FIRST SHUT UP IN THE PRISON OF THE LAW HE FELT NO PANG AT THE FRATRICIDE HE HAD COMMITTED
THEY WERE TAKEN DOWN BY GEORGE ROERER WHO HELD SOMETHING OF A DEANSHIP AT WITTENBERG UNIVERSITY AND WHO WAS ONE OF LUTHER'S AIDS IN THE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE
SINCE OUR OPPONENTS WILL NOT LET IT STAND THAT ONLY FAITH IN CHRIST JUSTIFIES WE WILL NOT YIELD TO THEM
SUCH DISCIPLINE IS GOOD FOR HIM OTHERWISE HE WOULD WASTE HIS INHERITANCE IN NO TIME
BUT IN VAIN THEY DO WORSHIP ME TEACHING FOR DOCTRINES THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN MATTHEW 15:9 HENCE THE LAW-RIGHTEOUS WORKERS ARE DOWNRIGHT REBELS AGAINST GOD AND IDOLATERS WHO CONSTANTLY SIN AGAINST THE FIRST COMMANDMENT
37:19 VERSE 7
FOR THIS REASON I AM SO ANXIOUS FOR YOU TO GAIN A TRUE PICTURE OF CHRIST OUT OF THE WORDS OF PAUL WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS OBVIOUSLY CHRIST IS NO JUDGE TO CONDEMN US FOR HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
CHARITY IS OFTEN DECEIVED BUT IS NEVER PUT OUT BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO LOSE
WE TEACH THAT CHRIST THE SON OF GOD HAS REDEEMED US FROM SIN AND EVERLASTING DEATH
HENCE THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
BUT WHEN THEY WERE COME HE WITHDREW AND SEPARATED HIMSELF FEARING THEM WHICH WERE OF THE CIRCUMCISION
YET THIS ONE SAYING FROM SOLOMON MISINTERPRETED AT THAT IS MADE TO COUNT FOR MORE THAN ALL THE MANY PROMISES OF ALL THE SCRIPTURES
THEREFORE WE CANNOT ALLOW THE LEAST JOT OF DOCTRINE TO BE CORRUPTED
I TAKE SIN TO MEAN NOT ONLY THE DEED BUT ROOT TREE FRUIT AND ALL
SOME FIND FAULT WITH PAUL FOR APPLYING THE TERM FAITH IN GENESIS 15:6 TO CHRIST
THE POISON IS NOT IN THE FLOWERS BUT IT IS THE NATURE OF THE SPIDER TO TURN WHAT IS GOOD AND WHOLESOME INTO POISON
FOR WE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
THE HEART DOES NOT FEEL HIS HELPFUL PRESENCE
A CHRISTIAN IS GREATER THAN THE WHOLE WORLD
THOSE WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED DO NOT FULFILL THE LAW
WE MUST TURN OUR EYES TO THE BRAZEN SERPENT CHRIST CRUCIFIED AND BELIEVE WITH ALL OUR HEART THAT HE IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OUR LIFE
THEY DESPISE GOD MAKE A LIAR OUT OF HIM SNUB CHRIST AND ALL HIS BENEFITS
WE MERELY CALLED ATTENTION TO CERTAIN ABUSES IN THE CHURCH
FOR IT IS WRITTEN THAT ABRAHAM HAD TWO SONS THE ONE BY A BONDMAID THE OTHER BY A FREEWOMAN
PS
VERSE 27
VERSE 27
OR DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD WOULD HAVE LEFT HIS CHURCH FLOUNDERING IN ERROR ALL THESE CENTURIES THE GALATIANS WERE TAKEN IN BY SUCH ARGUMENTS WITH THE RESULT THAT PAUL'S AUTHORITY AND DOCTRINE WERE DRAWN IN QUESTION
HOW MUCH MORE SHALL YOUR FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN GIVE GOOD THINGS TO THEM THAT ASK HIM TO COME TO PAUL'S ARGUMENT
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT REASON THINKS LITTLE OF FAITH
CHRIST MIGHT HAVE OVERCOME THE LAW BY AN EXERCISE OF HIS OMNIPOTENT AUTHORITY OVER THE LAW
THE INESTIMABLE MERCY OF GOD IS SUFFICIENTLY SET FORTH BY THE FACT THAT HIS SON WAS BORN OF A WOMAN
PAUL IS SAYING WHEN I WAS NOT YET BORN GOD ORDAINED ME TO BE AN APOSTLE AND IN DUE TIME CONFIRMED MY APOSTLESHIP BEFORE THE WORLD
TROUBLE STARTS WHEN THE PEOPLE THE NATIONS AND THEIR RULERS OF THE EARTH RAGE AND TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED
YOU CANNOT HURT ME THIS IS THE FAITH THAT OVERCOMES THE DEVIL
IS IT NOT AMAZING THAT PEOPLE HATE THE LAW THAT PROMOTES THEIR SAFETY AND WELFARE E.G THOU SHALT NOT KILL
GOD KNOWS US BETTER THAN WE KNOW GOD
HE HATES DREARY DOCTRINE GLOOMY AND MELANCHOLY THOUGHT
ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH THEY WERE SO UNEASY THAT I HAVE SEEN MURDERERS DIE WITH BETTER GRACE AND COURAGE
THEY ARE LIKE THE FALSE APOSTLES
INASMUCH AS THEY HAVE NOT ALTOGETHER PUT OFF THE SINFUL FLESH THEY ARE INCLINED TO SIN
WHEN PARENTS HAVE PUNISHED THEIR CHILDREN THEY GIVE THEM APPLES PEARS AND OTHER GOOD THINGS TO SHOW THEM THAT THEY MEAN WELL
OUTWARDLY THERE IS NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHRISTIAN AND ANY HONEST MAN
FOR HE GOD HATH MADE HIM CHRIST TO BE SIN FOR US WHO KNEW NO SIN
IF IN ADDITION TO FAITH WHICH COMES FIRST AS THE MOST ACCEPTABLE SERVICE UNTO GOD YOU WANT TO ADD LAWS THEN YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT ALL LAWS ARE COMPREHENDED IN THIS SHORT COMMANDMENT THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF PAUL KNOWS HOW TO EXPLAIN THE LAW OF GOD
A PERSON HAS THE FORM OF CHRIST WHEN HE BELIEVES IN CHRIST TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE
PAUL GOES ON TO PROVE FROM THIS QUOTATION OUT OF THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY THAT ALL MEN WHO ARE UNDER THE LAW ARE UNDER THE SENTENCE OF SIN OF THE WRATH OF GOD AND OF EVERLASTING DEATH
THE LAW WAS DELIVERED BY THE ANGELS BUT THE GOSPEL BY THE LORD HIMSELF
HE SAID TO THE LORD
THEY PERHAPS THOUGHT
IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS WE HAVE AN INSTANCE OF ITS FIRST USE
YOU CANNOT GROW STRONG THROUGH WEAKNESS AND RICH THROUGH POVERTY
BUT IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE I WILL HAVE CHRIST ONLY AS A GIFT
BESIDES THE DEVIL OUR ADVERSARY GOETH ABOUT SEEKING TO DEVOUR US BY ROARING
THIS DAY WILL THE LORD DELIVER THEE INTO MINE HAND
LET HIM BE AWARE OF IT SO LONG AS HE DOES NOT YIELD TO IT
AND AS MANY AS WALK ACCORDING TO THIS RULE PEACE BE ON THEM AND MERCY
HE IS BIGGER THAN YOU SATAN
STILL THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
IN THIS SENTENCE PAUL EXCUSES THE GALATIANS WHILE HE BLAMES THE FALSE APOSTLES FOR THE APOSTASY OF THE GALATIANS
ANY WORSHIP OF GOD ANY RELIGION WITHOUT CHRIST IS IDOLATRY
TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE GOSPEL HEAVENLY AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW EARTHLY
WHY DOES THE WORLD ABHOR THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THE GOSPEL AND THE BLESSINGS THAT GO WITH IT
VERSES 15 16 17
HIS GRACE ALONE VERSE 16
O FOOLISH GALATIANS HE CRIES
THEY REPLY
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD WHILE ISAAC WAS CALLED
BECAUSE MY TRANSGRESSIONS ARE MULTIPLIED AND MY OWN EFFORTS AT SELF-JUSTIFICATION RATHER A HINDRANCE THAN A FURTHERANCE THEREFORE CHRIST THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF INTO DEATH FOR MY SINS TO BELIEVE THIS IS TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE
BOTH ARE OF NO VALUE BECAUSE IN CHRIST JESUS NEITHER CIRCUMCISION NOR UNCIRCUMCISION AVAIL ANYTHING
IN THIS WAY ARE WE JUSTIFIED AND MADE HEIRS OF EVERLASTING LIFE
YET NOT I
BUT IT IS WELL TO HAVE THE TESTIMONY OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE IN THE LAST JUDGMENT THAT WE HAVE PERFORMED OUR DUTY FAITHFULLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOD'S WILL
THE GOSPEL OF THE CROSS WHICH THE CHURCH PROCLAIMS DOES NOT HAVE THE APPEAL THAT THE LAW HAS FOR MEN AND THEREFORE IT DOES NOT FIND MANY ADHERENTS
NO SOONER HAD PAUL TURNED HIS BACK ON THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA THAN THE FALSE APOSTLES WENT TO WORK
IT MADE HIM GUILTY OF THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD
THEY PROVOKE HIS ANGER ACCORDING TO THE PASSAGE
BUT BEFORE FAITH CAME WE WERE KEPT UNDER THE LAW SHUT UP UNTO THE FAITH WHICH SHOULD AFTERWARDS BE REVEALED
SUDDENLY CERTAIN FALSE BRETHREN BEGAN TO HATE US
THE THINGS MOST FORBIDDEN WE ALWAYS DESIRE AND THINGS MOST DENIED WE SEEK TO ACQUIRE I DO NOT DENY THAT THE LUST OF THE FLESH INCLUDES CARNAL LUST
LUKE REPORTS THAT THE CONTENTION BETWEEN PAUL AND BARNABAS WAS SO SHARP THAT THEY DEPARTED ASUNDER ONE FROM THE OTHER THE CAUSE OF THEIR DISAGREEMENT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SMALL SINCE IT SEPARATED THESE TWO WHO HAD BEEN JOINED TOGETHER FOR YEARS IN A HOLY PARTNERSHIP
THERE IS NOW NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS ROMANS 8:1 IF THE SON SHALL MAKE YOU FREE YE SHALL BE FREE INDEED JOHN 8:36 YOU WILL COMPLAIN
WE ALSO ARE ABLE TO WIN BACK MANY FROM THE ERRORS INTO WHICH THEY WERE SEDUCED BY SHOWING THAT THEIR BELIEFS ARE IMAGINARY WICKED AND CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD
WE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PERFORM THE WHOLE LAW
THEY SAY CHARITY CREATES AND ADORNS THEIR FAITH
IT SUPPLIES MEN WITH A NEEDED REALIZATION OF THEIR SINFULNESS
TO EAT AND TO DRINK OR NOT TO EAT AND DRINK IS IMMATERIAL
YOU DO NOT BEAR THINGS PATIENTLY
THIS PROMISE WAS MADE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE LAW WAS GIVEN
I KNOW THIS TO BE A FACT
SO HELP ME NOW THE SPIRIT INTERCEDES FOR US NOT IN MANY WORDS OR LONG PRAYERS BUT WITH GROANINGS WITH LITTLE SOUNDS LIKE ABBA SMALL AS THIS WORD IS IT SAYS EVER SO MUCH
VERSE 9
VERSE 9
VERSE 9
VERSE 9
VERSE 9
VERSE 9
WE FALL INTO SIN LIKE PETER DAVID AND OTHER HOLY MEN
FROM NOW TO THE END OF THE EPISTLE THE APOSTLE WRITES MOSTLY OF CHRISTIAN CONDUCT
THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE MANY NEW BATTLES WE HAVE TO WAGE NOWADAYS
LIFE IS SIN ERROR UNCLEANNESS MISERY AND CHARITY MUST FORBEAR BELIEVE HOPE AND SUFFER ALL THINGS
IF I A CONDEMNED SINNER COULD HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AND REDEEMED BY ANY OTHER PRICE WHY SHOULD THE SON OF GOD HAVE GIVEN HIMSELF FOR ME
THE ANABAPTISTS HATCH OUT SOME NEW MONSTROSITY
THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE WORSE THAN FALSE APOSTLES
IT IS THIS THAT I CONDEMN BECAUSE IT MAKES CHRIST OF NO EFFECT
I KNOW HE SAYS THAT THE FLESH COURTS SIN
A NEW CREATURE IS THE WORK OF THE HOLY GHOST WHO IMBUES OUR HEARTS WITH FAITH LOVE AND OTHER CHRISTIAN VIRTUES GRANTS US THE STRENGTH TO SUBDUE THE FLESH AND TO REJECT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE WORLD
PAUL DOES NOT SAY THAT CHRIST WAS MADE A CURSE FOR HIMSELF
THEY HAD CIRCUMCISION THE COVENANT THE PROMISES THE APOSTLESHIP
SUCH MEN SEEK NOT THEIR OWN GLORY BUT THE GLORY OF GOD
WHATSOEVER IS NOT OF FAITH IS SIN THOSE WHO SEEK TO EARN THE GRACE OF GOD BY THEIR OWN EFFORTS ARE TRYING TO PLEASE GOD WITH SINS
WE KNOW THAT GOOD WORKS OUGHT TO BE DONE BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN THE PROPER TIME COMES
WHEREVER YOU FIND A LOVE FOR THE WORD THANK GOD FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO INFUSES THIS LOVE INTO THE HEARTS OF MEN
GOD CALLS IN TWO WAYS
THE JEWS BELIEVED IF THEY KEPT THE LAW THEY WOULD BE SAVED
THEY TELL ME TO TRUST IN THE LORD THERE IS A TIME FOR THE LAW AND A TIME FOR GRACE
THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE FASTENED THEMSELVES UPON CHRIST AND CONDEMNED HIM
THEY INSISTED THAT CIRCUMCISION WAS OBLIGATORY UNTO SALVATION
IT MADE HIM ALL THE BOLDER TO CONFESS CHRIST
THIS IS SWEET COMFORT FOR US
THE FACT THAT I AM NOW ABSENT FROM YOU OUGHT NOT TO CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME
BUT BECAUSE GOD COMMANDS IT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT WE DO IT
SIN CANNOT HARM THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN CHRIST BECAUSE HE HAS OVERCOME SIN BY HIS DEATH
MY CALL IS IN EVERY RESPECT LIKE THE CALL OF THE APOSTLES
WHICH NEITHER OUR FATHERS NOR WE WERE ABLE TO BEAR
GOD THEY SAY MUST HAVE MISTRUSTED HIS OWN PROMISES AND CONSIDERED THEM INADEQUATE FOR SALVATION
THE REAL DOERS OF THE LAW ARE THE TRUE BELIEVERS
THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE VERDICT OF THE CONFERENCE
BUT HE THAT SOWETH TO THE SPIRIT SHALL OF THE SPIRIT REAP EVERLASTING LIFE
GOD IS NOT EVER GOING TO LET HIS MINISTERS STARVE
IN ADDITION WE SERVE EACH OTHER IN LOVE BECAUSE TRUE FAITH IS NOT IDLE
BY LOVE SERVE ONE ANOTHER YOU WILL NEVER LACK PEOPLE TO WHOM YOU MAY DO GOOD
BUT BECAUSE LIFE CANNOT GO ON WITHOUT SOME ORDINANCES THE GOSPEL PERMITS REGULATIONS TO BE MADE IN THE CHURCH IN REGARD TO SPECIAL DAYS TIMES PLACES ETC IN ORDER THAT THE PEOPLE MAY KNOW UPON WHAT DAY AT WHAT HOUR AND IN WHAT PLACE TO ASSEMBLE FOR THE WORD OF GOD
NOT ONCE DID YOU GALATIANS HEAR ME SPEAK OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW OR OF WORKS
BUT THE CONSCIENCE FINDS QUICK RELIEF IN THE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE
AND IF AT ANY TIME HE FELT ANGRY OR IMPATIENT HE RESISTED THESE FEELINGS BY THE SPIRIT
SUCH CHARITABLE CONFIDENCE IS THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT
YOU HAVE PERMITTED THIS AND THAT SIN ENVY IMPATIENCE AND THE LIKE
AS OFTEN AS HE SPEAKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS GRACE THE PROMISE THE ADOPTION AND THE INHERITANCE OF HEAVEN HE ADDS THE WORDS IN CHRIST OR THROUGH CHRIST TO SHOW THAT THESE BLESSINGS ARE NOT TO BE HAD BY THE LAW OR THE DEEDS OF THE LAW MUCH LESS BY OUR OWN EXERTIONS OR BY THE OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN TRADITIONS BUT ONLY BY AND THROUGH AND IN CHRIST
I MAY KNOW A PERSON BY SIGHT AND STILL NOT KNOW HIM BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME
I AM GOD
IF YOU CHOOSE CHRIST YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD
AND SO IT IS WITH THE CHURCH
THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION IS FRAGILE
FIRST A PERSON MUST LEARN TO KNOW HIMSELF FROM THE LAW
PAUL'S ARGUMENT HAS OFTEN COMFORTED ME
MY PEACE I GIVE UNTO YOU WORLDLY PEACE PROVIDES QUIET ENJOYMENT OF LIFE AND POSSESSIONS
FAITH AND HOPE ARE SO CLOSELY LINKED THAT THEY CANNOT BE SEPARATED
BUT HIS PROPHECY WAS AFTERWARDS CORRECTED BY THE LORD
HOW THEN CAN YOU SAY THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS OBTAINED BY THE LAW THE APOSTLE NOW GOES TO WORK TO EXPLAIN THE PROVINCE AND PURPOSE OF THE LAW
GROSS SINS AND VICES MAY BE RECOGNIZED OR ELSE REPRESSED BY THE THREAT OF PUNISHMENT
4:9 AGAIN UNTO THIS PRESENT HOUR WE BOTH HUNGER AND THIRST AND ARE NAKED AND ARE BUFFETED AND HAVE NO CERTAIN DWELLING-PLACE
I STRESS THIS ON ACCOUNT OF THE MANY ERRORS EMANATING FROM THE SECTS
THEY WISH TO BE THE LONE RULERS OF THE CHURCH
NEVERTHELESS FAITH MUST COME FIRST BECAUSE WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT A GOD-PLEASING DEED IS
UNTIL WE ENTER UPON OUR HEAVENLY INHERITANCE WE ARE ONLY TO HAVE OUR LITTLE FAITH TO GO BY
WE CANNOT SEE HIM
ALTHOUGH THE LAW KILLS GOD BRINGS GOOD OUT OF EVIL
WITH THE WORKING ABRAHAM WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO
IF GOD HAD MEANT FOR US TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE LAW FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE PROMISE AT LEAST HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE LAW AT THE SAME TIME HE GAVE THE PROMISE
THERE IS NO CONFORMITY IN DOCTRINE FAITH AND LIFE
WHEN PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FLESH LUSTETH AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH HE MEANS TO SAY THAT WE ARE NOT TO THINK SPEAK OR DO THE THINGS TO WHICH THE FLESH INCITES US
IN OPEN CONTRADICTION TO THE SCRIPTURES OUR OPPONENTS MISQUOTE HE THAT BELIEVETH IN CHRIST IS CONDEMNED BECAUSE HE HAS FAITH WITHOUT WORKS OUR OPPONENTS TURN EVERYTHING TOPSY-TURVY
WE DO NOT SAY THAT THE GOSPEL INSTIGATED THESE UPHEAVALS
WHOEVER SPEAKS THE TRUTH IS COUNTED AN ENEMY
THERE IS NO VILLAGE TOO SMALL TO CONTAIN SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE CONSIDERED WISER OR BETTER THAN THE REST
MY FATHER I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE AND YOU SEEM SO FAR AWAY
THESE MEN DO EXCEEDINGLY TROUBLE OUR CITY THIS MAN LUTHER IS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING A PESTILENT FELLOW WHO TROUBLES THE PAPACY AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE
APPARENTLY THEY SURPASSED PAUL IN LEARNING AND GODLINESS
THEY FOUND THAT PAUL HAD CIRCUMCISED TIMOTHY ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT PAUL HAD PURIFIED HIMSELF WITH FOUR OTHER MEN IN THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM THAT PAUL HAD SHAVEN HIS HEAD AT CENCHREA
I AM DEAD I AM NOT DEAD
10 11 AND PAUL WRITES
BUT CHRIST DID NOT SUFFER AND DIE IN VAIN
AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION IT FLARES UP DEMANDS TO BE REVENGED AND HATES A NEIGHBOR LIKE AN ENEMY OR AT LEAST DOES NOT LOVE HIM AS MUCH AS HE OUGHT TO BE LOVED
THE SAME WHICH I ALSO WAS FORWARD TO DO
WE HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN
IF THE SON SHALL MAKE YOU FREE YE SHALL BE FREE INDEED HE ONLY STANDS BETWEEN US AND THE EVILS WHICH TROUBLE AND AFFLICT US AND WHICH HE HAS OVERCOME FOR US
HAVING FIRST FORTIFIED HIS CASE WITH INVINCIBLE ARGUMENTS HE CAN AFFORD TO INJECT THIS ALLEGORY TO ADD IMPRESSIVENESS AND BEAUTY TO HIS PRESENTATION
HOW CAN ANYBODY SAY THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS OBTAINED BY OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW WHEN THE LAW WAS GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER GOD'S PROMISE OF THE BLESSING
OUTWARDLY THEY LOOK ALIKE
THERE IS A TWOFOLD KNOWLEDGE OF GOD GENERAL AND PARTICULAR
YE OBSERVE DAYS AND MONTHS AND TIMES AND YEARS
BUT THEY DO NOT
CHRIST IS GOD BY NATURE AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD WE NEED SUCH FREQUENT CONFIRMATION OF OUR FAITH FOR SATAN WILL NOT FAIL TO ATTACK IT
GOD HAS ORDAINED CIVIL LAWS TO PUNISH CRIME
THIS IS THE WICKED TEACHING OF THE PAPACY
HERE PAUL PLAYS THE LAW AGAINST THE LAW AS IF TO SAY
IT MUST COME TO AN END
THE LORD IS NOT SLACK CONCERNING HIS PROMISES BECAUSE OF OUR SINS OR HASTENS HIS PROMISES BECAUSE OF ANY MERIT ON OUR PART GOD'S PROMISES ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY OUR ATTITUDES
YET OF SUCH SCHOOLMASTERS THERE WERE PLENTY IN FORMER TIMES REGULAR BRUISERS
IF I WOULD KEEP SILENT ALL WOULD BE WELL AND THE POPE WOULD NO MORE PERSECUTE ME
YOU HAD NOT VIRTUE PRIOR TO THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL AND YOU HAVE NO VIRTUES NOW UNDER THE REGIME OF THE FALSE APOSTLES WE TOO MAY SAY TO THOSE WHO MISNAME THEMSELVES EVANGELICAL AND FLOUT THEIR NEW-FOUND LIBERTY
BUT WITH EVERLASTING KINDNESS WILL I HAVE MERCY ON THEE ISA
BUT THE SETTING-UP EXERCISES OF THE MONKS DRAW GREAT APPLAUSE
IF YE THEN BEING EVIL KNOW HOW TO GIVE GOOD GIFTS TO YOUR CHILDREN
PRODUCED BY LAURA J
THOUGH LAW AND SIN REMAIN THEY NO LONGER CONCERN YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE DEAD TO THE LAW AND DEAD TO SIN BLESSED IS THE PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THIS TRUTH IN TIMES OF DISTRESS
GENTLENESS GENTLENESS IN CONDUCT AND LIFE
NO TRUTH BUT HYPOCRISY
THIS EXPLAINS THE MANY EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET IN THE PSALMS AND IN THE ENTIRE BIBLE
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE UNTO GOD BURY THE LAW AND FIND LIFE THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
THEY HELP US IN THE TRIALS OF OUR FAITH
THE MINISTER OF THE LAW AND THE MINISTER OF GRACE
HE DOES NOT SAY WHO RECEIVED OUR WORKS BUT WHO GAVE GAVE WHAT
WHAT THESE INFIRMITIES WERE HE HIMSELF EXPLAINS IN II CORINTHIANS 12:9 10
HIS NEED OF ANGELIC COMFORT HIS TREMULOUS PRAYER IN THE GARDEN HIS LAMENTATION ON THE CROSS MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME BEAR ELOQUENT WITNESS TO THE STING OF THE LAW
ALL MEN HAVE THE GENERAL AND INSTINCTIVE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A GOD WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH WHO IS JUST AND HOLY AND WHO PUNISHES THE WICKED
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THE MINISTRY IS PRAISED
WHO SEPARATED ME FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB
WHEN THE MEMBERS OF A CHRISTIAN CONGREGATION PERMIT THEIR PASTOR TO STRUGGLE ALONG IN PENURY THEY ARE WORSE THAN HEATHEN
SATAN'S SATELLITES SOFTSOAP THE PEOPLE
THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS...SHOWING MERCY UNTO THOUSANDS
THE SCHOLASTICS MONKS AND OTHERS OF THEIR ILK FOUGHT ONLY AGAINST CARNAL LUST AND WERE PROUD OF A VICTORY WHICH THEY NEVER OBTAINED
THE POPE QUOTES CHRIST'S SAYING RECORDED IN JOHN 13:15 I HAVE GIVEN YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT YE SHOULD DO AS I HAVE DONE TO YOU WE DO NOT DENY THAT CHRISTIANS OUGHT TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST
BUT THE GOOD LORD HAD MERCY UPON ME
IF YOU PERFORM THE VOWS OF CHASTITY OBEDIENCE ETC YOU WILL BE REWARDED WITH EVERLASTING LIFE LET THESE PLAYTHINGS OF THE DEVIL GO TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND LISTEN TO WHAT PAUL HAS TO SAY IN THIS VERSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHRIST'S OWN TEACHING
EVERYONE WHO BY FAITH SLAYS REASON THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MONSTER RENDERS GOD A REAL SERVICE A BETTER SERVICE THAN THE RELIGIONS OF ALL RACES AND ALL THE DRUDGERY OF MERITORIOUS MONKS CAN RENDER
HERE THE QUESTION ARISES BY WHAT MEANS ARE WE JUSTIFIED
GALATIANS 5:6 FAITH WHICH WORKETH BY LOVE LEVITICUS 18:5 WHICH IF A MAN DO HE SHALL LIVE IN THEM MATTHEW 19:17 IF THOU WILT ENTER INTO LIFE KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS PSALM 37:27 DEPART FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD IN THESE AND OTHER PASSAGES WHERE MENTION IS MADE OF DOING THE SCRIPTURES ALWAYS SPEAK OF A FAITHFUL DOING A DOING INSPIRED BY FAITH
PAUL DOES NOT DENY THAT HE HAD BEEN WITH SOME OF THE APOSTLES
DO NOT MISTAKE THIS ONE WORD ABOVE TO REFER TO THE TRIUMPHANT CHURCH IN HEAVEN BUT TO THE MILITANT CHURCH ON EARTH
STAND FAST THEREFORE IN THE LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE
I MENTION THIS TO URGE ALL TO LEARN HOW PROPERLY TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL IN ORDER TO AVOID DISSEMBLING
HE WENT TO JERUSALEM UNINVITED NOT TO BE INSTRUCTED BUT TO VISIT WITH PETER
THIS SORT OF THING BRINGS THE GOSPEL INTO TROUBLE
SIN IS DEFEATED AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TRIUMPHS AND REIGNS FOREVER
BEHOLD NOW I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO GOD IN ALL THE EARTH BUT IN ISRAEL II KINGS 5:15 NAAMAN DOES NOT DO A THING
WHENEVER YOU ARE ANGRY WITH YOUR BROTHER FOR ANY CAUSE REPRESS YOUR VIOLENT EMOTIONS THROUGH THE SPIRIT
BY THE TERM FLESH PAUL DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MANIFEST VICES
YOU ARE NOT THE CHILDREN OF GOD
THIS SHOULD CONVINCE YOU THAT BY MY PREACHING I DO NOT SEEK THE FAVOR AND PRAISE OF MEN BUT THE GLORY OF GOD NO MAN CAN SAY THAT WE ARE SEEKING THE FAVOR AND PRAISE OF MEN WITH OUR DOCTRINE
NOT BY CURIOUS INQUIRIES INTO THE NATURE OF GOD SHALL WE KNOW GOD AND HIS PURPOSE FOR OUR SALVATION BUT BY TAKING HOLD OF CHRIST WHO ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF THE FATHER HAS GIVEN HIMSELF INTO DEATH FOR OUR SINS
ALL HAVE SINNED AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD AND THERE IS NONE THAT DOETH GOOD NO NOT ONE AND AGAINST THEE THEE ONLY HAVE I SINNED HAVING BEEN HUMBLED BY THE LAW AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT TO A RIGHT ESTIMATE OF HIMSELF A MAN WILL REPENT
KNOW YE THEREFORE THAT THEY WHICH ARE OF FAITH THE SAME ARE THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
KNOW YE THEREFORE THAT THEY WHICH ARE OF FAITH THE SAME ARE THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
WE ARE MERE ONLOOKERS WATCHING TO SEE WHO WILL WIN THE VICTORY CHRIST OR HIS OPPONENTS
HE WILL NOT PUNISH NOR CONDEMN US FOR IT
THE WRATH AND THE JUDGMENT OF GOD DISPLEASE ME MY WRATH AND IMPATIENCE DISPLEASE HIM
THE TROUBLE IS OUR FLESH WILL NOT LET US BELIEVE IN CHRIST WITH ALL OUR HEART
HE CLOTHES US WITH THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST BY MEANS OF BAPTISM AS THE APOSTLE SAYS IN THIS VERSE
CHRIST HIMSELF BROKE THE SABBATH AS THE JEWS CLAIMED BY HEALING THE SICK ON THE SABBATH
BUT AS FOR ME I WAS CALLED NEITHER OF MEN NOR BY MAN BUT DIRECTLY BY JESUS CHRIST
ARMED WITH THIS CONVICTION WE ARE ENLIGHTENED AND MAY PASS JUDGMENT UPON THE PAPISTS MONKS NUNS PRIESTS MOHAMMEDANS ANABAPTISTS AND ALL WHO TRUST IN THEIR OWN MERITS AS WICKED AND DESTRUCTIVE SECTS THAT ROB GOD AND CHRIST OF THE HONOR THAT BELONGS TO THEM ALONE
THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO MORE THAN GOD EXPECTS OF THEM SO THAT THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO SELL THEIR SUPERFLUOUS MERITS TO LAYMEN THEREBY SAVING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
YET YOU PERMITTED YOURSELVES TO BE SEDUCED TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DISOBEYED THE TRUTH OF CHRIST VERSE 1
THEN TOO WE LIVE IN THE FEAR OF GOD
9:13 14 VERSE 8
I WOULD RATHER BELIEVE HIM THAN ALL THAT RIFFRAFF OF PIOUS LAW-WORKERS
EVENTUALLY THE CONSCIENCE WAKES UP TO THE FACT THAT GOD IS ANGRY
FORMERLY WHEN THE TRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS WERE TAUGHT IN THE CHURCH THE DEVIL WAS NOT EXCITED AS HE IS NOW
THE CHILDREN OF THE LAW WILL ALWAYS PERSECUTE THE CHILDREN OF THE GOSPEL
RIGHTLY ARE THE DOERS OF THE LAW CALLED DEVIL'S MARTYRS
THESE CONTRADICTIONS NO PERSON CAN HARMONIZE WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE WAY OF SALVATION
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONDEMN THAT CONSCIENCE IN WHICH JESUS DWELLS FOR JESUS HAS TAKEN FROM THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THE RIGHT AND POWER TO CURSE US
WHO HATH BEWITCHED YOU THAT YE SHOULD NOT OBEY THE TRUTH
I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU GALATIANS THROUGH THE GOSPEL GIVING YOU THE FORM OF CHRIST
OUR SAVIOR CHRIST ALSO WARNED US SAYING
BUT LOOK AT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL RUNNING AWAY FROM IT THE FLIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FROM MOUNT SINAI INDICATES HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE LAW
WHO CAN FULLY APPRECIATE THE BLESSING OF THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND OF EVERLASTING LIFE
INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME WHEN MEN CLAIMING SUCH CREDENTIALS COME ALONG THEY DECEIVE NOT ONLY THE NAIVE BUT ALSO THOSE WHO SEEMINGLY ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH
THAT NONE OF YOU MAY HIDE BEHIND THE PLEA OF IGNORANCE I WILL ENUMERATE FIRST THE WORKS OF THE FLESH AND THEN ALSO THE WORKS OF THE SPIRIT THERE WERE MANY HYPOCRITES AMONG THE GALATIANS AS THERE ARE ALSO AMONG US WHO PRETEND TO BE CHRISTIANS AND TALK MUCH ABOUT THE SPIRIT BUT THEY WALK NOT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT
THE FAULT LIES NOT WITH CHRIST BUT WITH US
WE HAVE PERMITTED IN THE FINAL REVISION OF THE MANUSCRIPT MANY A PASSAGE TO STAND WHICH SEEMED WEAK AND INEFFECTUAL WHEN COMPARED WITH THE TRUMPET TONES OF THE LATIN ORIGINAL
PEOPLE WHO PREFER THE LAW TO THE GOSPEL ARE LIKE AESOP'S DOG WHO LET GO OF THE MEAT TO SNATCH AT THE SHADOW OF THE WATER
BUT THIS DIFFERENCE OUGHT NOT TO HINDER OUR FRIENDSHIP SINCE WE PREACH ONE AND THE SAME GOSPEL VERSE 10
CORNELIUS WAS JUSTIFIED WITHOUT THE LAW THEREFORE THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY
IT INVOLVES THE DEATH OF THE SON OF GOD WHO DIED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD
HE WOULD LIKE BEST OF ALL TO PERSECUTE US WITH FIRE AND SWORD BUT THIS METHOD HAS AVAILED HIM LITTLE BECAUSE THROUGH THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS THE CHURCH HAS BEEN WATERED
I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY A PERSON BEFORE GOD
I WISH THAT THEY WERE BACK THERE WHERE THEY BELONG UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF THE POPE
THE PROPHETS ALSO TAUGHT THE LAW AND PERFORMED MIRACLES
FOR IN DUE SEASON WE SHALL REAP IF WE FAINT NOT
IF THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL DOES NOT ACCOMPANY IT THE LAW WILL NEVER PRODUCE TRUE CONVERSION AND HEARTFELT REPENTANCE
BUT NOW YE SEEK TO KILL ME A MAN THAT HATH TOLD YOU THE TRUTH AND IN VERSE 42
HE CALLS IT THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD
IF PAUL HAD NOT REPROVED HIM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SLIDING BACK OF CHRISTIANS INTO THE JEWISH RELIGION AND A RETURN TO THE BURDENS OF THE LAW
BUT NOW YOU HAVE LOST EVERYTHING THE GOSPEL FAITH AND THE SPIRITUAL BENEFIT OF YOUR SUFFERINGS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
WE SEEK THE HONOR OF CHRIST AND THE WELFARE OF MEN
THESE SOFT MARTYRS TAKE NO CHANCES
EVERY MAN SHALL BEAR HIS OWN BURDEN
THEIR UNINTENTIONAL LAPSES ARE FORGIVEN IF THEY PULL THEMSELVES TOGETHER BY FAITH IN CHRIST
SO THEN THEY WHICH BE OF FAITH ARE BLESSED WITH FAITHFUL ABRAHAM
AS MANY OF YOU AS HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST HAVE PUT ON CHRIST WITH THIS CHANGE OF GARMENTS A NEW BIRTH A NEW LIFE STIRS IN US
THOU HAST LED CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE PSALM 68:18
YET WE MAKE LITTLE HEADWAY BECAUSE THE DEVIL SEDUCES PEOPLE INTO MISBELIEF BY TAKING CHRIST OUT OF THEIR SIGHT AND FOCUSING THEIR EYES UPON THE LAW
YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE HOW THE WRITTEN PAGE WILL AFFECT THE READER BECAUSE HIS MOOD HIS CIRCUMSTANCES HIS AFFECTIONS ARE SO CHANGEABLE
MEANTIME THEY PRETEND GREAT HUMILITY AND ACKNOWLEDGE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SINFULNESS FOR WHICH THEY SOULFULLY JOIN IN THE PUBLICAN'S PRAYER GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME A SINNER BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
THE SPIRIT OF GOD CANNOT AT ONCE OVERCOME HUMAN DEFICIENCY
AND MARY HATH CHOSEN THAT GOOD PART WHICH SHALL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER A PERSON BECOMES A CHRISTIAN NOT BY WORKING BUT BY HEARING
WHAT IS MORE I WON THE INDORSEMENT OF THE APOSTLES
DO NOT JUDGE MY HEART ACCORDING TO MY WORDS WE REQUEST THE SAME CONSIDERATION FOR OURSELVES
FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES I AM NOT TO BE BELIEVED NOR IS THE CHURCH TO BE BELIEVED OR THE FATHERS OR THE APOSTLES OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IF THEY TEACH ANYTHING CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD
TO HIM THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT BE GLORY WORLD WITHOUT END
NEEDLESS TO SAY WHEN WE HAVE PUT ON THE ROBE OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST WE MUST NOT FORGET TO PUT ON ALSO THE MANTLE OF THE IMITATION OF CHRIST
I KNOW HOW QUICKLY A PERSON CAN FORFEIT THE JOY OF THE GOSPEL
THE LAW MAKES THEM TEN TIMES WEAKER AND POORER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE
THE SECOND PART IS THIS
ON THE CONTRARY WE ARE HATED BY THE WHOLE WORLD WITH RARE BITTERNESS
AND YE SHALL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH
HE CONDEMNS THOSE WHO REMOVED THEM RATHER THAN THE GALATIANS
GOD NEVER YET GAVE TO ANY PERSON GRACE AND EVERLASTING LIFE AS A REWARD FOR MERIT
PAUL FINDS HIS ARGUMENTS FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH EVERYWHERE
THE FACT IS THE LAW COMMANDS NOTHING BUT CHARITY AS WE MAY GATHER FROM THE FOLLOWING SCRIPTURE PASSAGES
LET US UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAW AND CHRIST ARE IMPOSSIBLE BEDFELLOWS
THEY WERE ALL TAUGHT OF GOD
CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE GOOD START YOU HAD AND LOST BUT CONSIDER ALSO THE MANY THINGS YOU HAVE SUFFERED FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOSPEL AND FOR THE NAME OF CHRIST
ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO HAVE A DIVINE CALL MUST SUFFER A GOOD DEAL OF OPPOSITION IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BECOME FORTIFIED AGAINST THE RUNNING ATTACKS OF THE DEVIL AND THE WORLD
3:13 I HEAR WITH MY OWN EARS THAT I CANNOT BE SAVED EXCEPT BY THE BLOOD AND DEATH OF CHRIST
FAITH SAYS
JEROME WHO UNDERSTOOD NOT THIS PASSAGE NOR THE WHOLE EPISTLE FOR THAT MATTER EXCUSES PETER'S ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS DONE IN IGNORANCE BUT PETER OFFENDED BY GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS INDORSING THE LAW
IT MAY RESTRAIN EVIL BUT IT DOES NOT DELIVER FROM SIN
THE LAW IS NOT OF FAITH WHAT IS THIS CHARITY THE SCHOLASTICS TALK SO MUCH ABOUT
HE IS TO BE DUSTED OFF AND BROUGHT OUT BEFORE THE WORLD
THE LAW IS THE HAMMER OF DEATH THE THUNDER OF HELL AND THE LIGHTNING OF GOD'S WRATH TO BRING DOWN THE PROUD AND SHAMELESS HYPOCRITES
IT HOLDS THE MIRROR TO THE EVIL WHICH IS IN THE WORLD
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE LAW HAD BEEN GIVEN WITHOUT A MEDIATOR AND THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN DENIED THE SERVICES OF A GO-BETWEEN
WHEN THE LAW WAS INSTITUTED ON MOUNT SINAI IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY LIGHTNING BY STORMS BY THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS TO TEAR TO PIECES THAT MONSTER CALLED SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS
BUT WITH DOCTRINE THERE MUST BE NO ERROR NO NEED OF PARDON
THE SECOND PURPOSE OF THE LAW IS SPIRITUAL AND DIVINE
IN COMPARISON WITH THESE SANCTIMONIOUS HYPOCRITES OF THE PAPACY PUBLICANS AND HARLOTS ARE NOT BAD
THEY WILL FALL TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF HELL
BUT AS OF ONE AND TO THY SEED WHICH IS CHRIST
YOU ENDURED MUCH FOR THE NAME OF CHRIST AND YOU ENDURED IT FAITHFULLY
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HIS SUFFERING AND DEATH HIS RESURRECTION HIS VICTORY OVER SIN DEATH AND THE DEVIL IF MEN MAY OVERCOME THESE EVILS BY THEIR OWN ENDEAVOR
THE LORD THAT DELIVERED ME OUT OF THE PAW OF THE LION AND OUT OF THE PAW OF THE BEAR HE WILL DELIVER ME OUT OF THE HAND OF THIS PHILISTINE AGAIN
IT IS THE LOT OF GOD'S MINISTERS NOT ONLY TO SUFFER OPPOSITION AT THE HAND OF A WICKED WORLD BUT ALSO TO SEE THE PATIENT INDOCTRINATION OF MANY YEARS QUICKLY UNDONE BY SUCH RELIGIOUS FANATICS
THOSE WHO FALL FROM GRACE PERISH NO MATTER HOW THEY GO ABOUT IT
FOR IS HE NOT A MERCIFUL AND GENEROUS FATHER WHO GIVES GOOD THINGS EVEN TO THE UNWORTHY AND UNGRATEFUL
OF THE JEWS FIVE TIMES RECEIVED I FORTY STRIPES SAVE ONE
2:14 THERE IS NONE THAT UNDERSTANDETH THERE IS NONE THAT SEEKETH AFTER GOD ROMANS 3:11 HENCE THERE IS REALLY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JEW A MOHAMMEDAN AND ANY OTHER OLD OR NEW HERETIC
TO SAY THIS IS EASY BUT IN TIMES OF TRIAL WHEN THE CONSCIENCE WRITHES IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD IT IS NOT SO EASY TO DO
BUT TO SAY THAT CHRIST DIED IN VAIN IS A DEADLY INSULT
FOR WE ARE BY NATURE THE CHILDREN OF WRATH EVEN AS OTHERS EPH
WHAT CLAIM CAN MEN WHO ARE SUBSERVIENT TO SIN SUBJECT TO THE CURSE OF THE LAW AND WORTHY OF EVERLASTING DEATH HAVE ON GOD AND ETERNAL LIFE
THE GALATIANS WERE EASILY DECEIVED BY OUTWARD APPEARANCES
HENCE WE ARE NOT DELIVERED BY OUR OWN WILL OR SHREWDNESS OR WISDOM BUT BY THE MERCY AND LOVE OF GOD AS IT IS WRITTEN I JOHN 4:10 HEREIN IS LOVE NOT THAT WE LOVED GOD BUT THAT HE LOVED US AND SENT HIS SON TO BE THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS ANOTHER REASON WHY PAUL LIKE JOHN EMPHASIZES THE FATHER'S WILL IS CHRIST'S HABIT OF DIRECTING ATTENTION TO THE FATHER
ELSEWHERE PAUL WRITES
NOW THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE MANIFEST WHICH ARE THESE
NOW THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE MANIFEST WHICH ARE THESE
WE DO NOT CONDEMN THE LAW CIRCUMCISION ETC FOR THEIR FAILURE TO JUSTIFY US
IT KILLS
BY INSISTING THAT EVERYTHING BE PERFECT THEY NOT ONLY FAIL TO BEAR THE BURDENS OF THE WEAK THEY ACTUALLY OFFEND THE WEAK BY THEIR SEVERITY
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT SIN DEATH AND THE CURSE ARE VOID WHY THEY ARE NULL ZERO
BUT BECAUSE THEY DEMANDED IT ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR SALVATION PAUL DEFIED THEM AND PREVAILED
THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW ARE FALLEN FROM GRACE AND ARE IN GRAVE DANGER OF ETERNAL DEATH
PAUL MANHANDLES THE LAW
HE SAYS THAT WE ARE CRUCIFIED AND DEAD UNTO THE LAW
BUT YOU DO NOT DO IT
HE IS THAT BEFORE HE GOES TO WORK
HENCE THE BEST SERVICE THAT ANYBODY CAN RENDER GOD IS DILIGENTLY TO HEAR AND READ GOD'S WORD
THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD I COR
NO LIFE BUT ETERNAL DEATH
BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK THE SINS OF THE WORLD HIS SINLESSNESS WAS DEFILED WITH THE SINFULNESS OF THE WORLD
WE PREACH FOR THE FAVOR OF GOD ALONE WHOSE GRACE AND MERCY WE PROCLAIM
THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS RECEIVED BY FAITH IS QUICKLY SAID BUT NOT SO QUICKLY DONE
WITHOUT THIS FEAR THERE CAN BE NO THIRST FOR GOD'S MERCY
THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE GENTILES HAD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST THROUGH MY MINISTRY
NO THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
NO THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
AFTER MOSES NO PROPHET OR KING ADDED A SINGLE LAW TO THE BOOK
BUT THE DEEDS OF DAVID MUST BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO THE PERSONALITY OF DAVID
TO JUSTIFY THE CRUEL INQUISITIVENESS THEY QUOTE THE STATEMENT OF POPE GREGORY
WE SHALL REALIZE THAT HE LOVED US WRETCHED SINNERS SO MUCH INDEED THAT HE GAVE US HIS ONLY-BEGOTTEN SON INTO DEATH FOR US
AS WE SAID BEFORE SO SAY I NOW AGAIN
THE TRUTH IS WE ARE COMMISSIONED BY GOD TO RESIST THE POPE FOR IT IS WRITTEN WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN ACTS 5:29 WE HAVE SEEN HOW PAUL REFUTES THE ARGUMENT OF THE FALSE APOSTLES CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY OF THE APOSTLES
THEY DO NOT CONSIDER ITS SPIRITUAL EFFECT AND PURPOSE WHICH IS NOT TO JUSTIFY OR TO PACIFY AFFLICTED CONSCIENCES BUT TO INCREASE SIN TO TERRIFY THE CONSCIENCE AND TO PRODUCE WRATH
I WOULD HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO CALL JERUSALEM SARAH OR THE NEW TESTAMENT
AND HE BELIEVED IN THE LORD
ST AUGUSTINE OBSERVED THAT EVERY MAN IS CERTAIN OF HIS FAITH IF HE HAS FAITH THIS THE ROMANISTS DENY
THE LAW OF MOSES CONDEMNS ME
HE IS KEPT UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE
WE ARE THE SEED AND CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM LET US BEGIN WITH ABRAHAM AND LEARN HOW THIS FRIEND OF GOD WAS JUSTIFIED AND SAVED
NOT BECAUSE IT FULFILLED THE LAW BUT BECAUSE NINEVEH BELIEVED THE WORD OF GOD
OUR OBEDIENCE IS INSPIRED BY FEAR
IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY YOU WOULD HAVE PLUCKED OUT YOUR EYES AND SACRIFICED YOUR LIVES FOR ME AND IN VERY FACT THE GALATIANS SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES FOR PAUL
MANY OF OUR MINISTERS ARE BEGINNING TO DO THAT VERY THING
THE REASON I WRITE TO YOU IS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU THE BITTER POTION MUST BE SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND SUGAR TO MAKE IT PALATABLE
NO WONDER THE APOSTLE EXPRESSES THE WISH THAT HE COULD SPEAK TO THE GALATIANS IN PERSON
WITH THIS SENTENCE THE APOSTLE PAUL CONCLUDES HIS ALLEGORY OF THE BARREN CHURCH
TO BE JUSTIFIED BY SUCH MEANS WOULD MAKE CHRIST OF NO VALUE TO US
WE SHALL NEVER BE IN DANGER OF MISCONSTRUING THE MEANING OF THE LAW
CHRIST FULFILLED THE LAW FOR US
THE INIQUITY OF MAN DID IT
FAITH MUST OF COURSE BE SINCERE
FOR ANYBODY TO COVET PRAISE IS FOOLISH BECAUSE THE PRAISE OF MEN WILL BE OF NO HELP TO YOU IN THE HOUR OF DEATH
AND DID ALL DRINK THE SPIRITUAL DRINK
SAY WITH CONFIDENCE
IT TAKES IN ALL THE CORRUPT DESIRES WITH WHICH THE BELIEVERS ARE MORE OR LESS INFECTED AS PRIDE HATRED COVETOUSNESS IMPATIENCE
ONCE PAUL HAD RECEIVED THE GOSPEL FROM CHRIST HE CONFERRED WITH NOBODY IN DAMASCUS
YE ARE KNOWN OF GOD MEANS THAT GOD BRINGS HIS GOSPEL TO OUR ATTENTION AND ENDOWS US WITH FAITH AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
AND YOU ARE TO BLAME BECAUSE YOU LED THE PEOPLE OUT OF EGYPT
HE SAID
HE SAID
THE LAW CANNOT BEGET CHILDREN OF GOD
WE SHOULD NOT ONLY DESIRE PEOPLE TO PRAISE THE MINISTRY OF THE GOSPEL BUT ALSO DO OUR UTMOST TO MAKE THE MINISTRY WORTHY OF PRAISE BECAUSE THIS WILL MAKE THE MINISTRY MORE EFFECTIVE
GOOD WORKS ARE NOT THE CAUSE BUT THE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
THE SENTENCE OF DEATH AND EVERLASTING DAMNATION HAD LONG BEEN PRONOUNCED OVER US
DOES NOT THE LAW COMMAND CHARITY
IT IS LIKELY THAT AT TIMES HE FELT EVEN THE STIRRINGS OF CARNAL LUST BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE QUICKLY SUPPRESSED THEM
L HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU THROUGH THE LORD
IN SHORT HE IS NO LESS THAN INFINITE MERCY AND INEFFABLE GOODNESS BOUNTIFULLY GIVING HIMSELF FOR US
WHEN A PERSON FEELS THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW HE IS LIKELY TO THINK
I CAN QUOTE THE SAME AUTHORITY AGAINST THEM FOR THE APOSTLES ARE ON MY SIDE
TO TEACH THAT BESIDES FAITH IN CHRIST OTHER DEVICES LIKE WORKS OR THE OBSERVANCE OF RULES TRADITIONS OR CEREMONIES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND EVERLASTING LIFE IS TO MAKE CHRIST AND HIS SALVATION OF NO BENEFIT TO ANYBODY
THE CHRISTIAN FEELS THE UNHOLY CONDITION OF HIS HEART AND IT MAKES HIM FEEL SO LOW THAT HE CANNOT TRUST IN HIS GOOD WORKS
CHRIST TASTES GOOD TO THEM
WHAT KIND OF LIFE WOULD THIS BE IF ONE PERSON COULD NOT BELIEVE ANOTHER PERSON
NEITHER DOES PAUL INTEND TO LEAVE THAT IMPRESSION
AFTER WE HAVE TAUGHT FAITH IN CHRIST WE TEACH GOOD WORKS
THE LAW AS THE HUSBAND OF THE FRUITFUL WOMAN PROCREATES MANY CHILDREN
WE MIGHT AS WELL LIVE LIKE WILD PEOPLE IF THE LAW DOES NOT COUNT
WHEN THE CONSCIENCE HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED BY THE LAW IT WELCOMES THE GOSPEL OF GRACE WITH ITS MESSAGE OF A SAVIOR WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD NOT TO BREAK THE BRUISED REED NOR TO QUENCH THE SMOKING FLAX BUT TO PREACH GLAD TIDINGS TO THE POOR TO HEAL THE BROKEN-HEARTED AND TO GRANT FORGIVENESS OF SINS TO ALL THE CAPTIVES
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE ONE MIND ONE IMPRESSION ONE FAITH CONCERNING CHRIST AMONG TRUE BELIEVERS WHETHER THEY LIVE IN TIMES PAST NOW OR IN TIMES TO COME
BUT SHOW ME A PUPIL WHO LOVES HIS SCHOOLMASTER
FOR THAT MATTER,--THE LAW CONTINUES TO REVEAL SIN
THIS GOES TO PROVE THAT THE CHILDREN OF FAITH ARE THE REAL CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM
IN SO FAR AS THE LAW IMPELS US TO CHRIST IT RENDERS EXCELLENT SERVICE
BUT HE DENIES THAT EITHER OF THEM DO ANY GOOD
ONE LAW BREEDS TEN MORE UNTIL THEIR NUMBER IS LEGION
FOR THAT MATTER GOD DID BEAR WITH THEM AS HE BORE WITH THE INFIRMITY OF ISRAEL WHEN THE PEOPLE HALTED BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS
TRUE CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE NATURE OF GOD BUT INTO GOD'S PURPOSE AND WILL IN CHRIST WHOM GOD INCORPORATED IN OUR FLESH TO LIVE AND TO DIE FOR OUR SINS
WHETHER THOSE WHO ARE IN AUTHORITY GOVERN WISELY
THE APOSTLE EXHORTS ALL CHRISTIANS TO PRACTICE GOOD WORKS AFTER THEY HAVE EMBRACED THE PURE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED THEY STILL HAVE THE OLD FLESH TO REFRAIN THEM FROM DOING GOOD
HE REMINDS THEM OF THE TIME WHEN HE OPPOSED PETER TO HIS FACE AND REPROVED THE CHIEF OF THE APOSTLES
YOU ARE SO BEWITCHED THAT YOU NO LONGER OBEY THE TRUTH
BUT NOW I GIVE THANKS UNTO GOD THE FATHER OF ALL MERCIES WHO HAS CALLED ME OUT OF DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT OF HIS GLORIOUS GOSPEL AND HAS GRANTED UNTO ME THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST JESUS MY LORD
AND THAT MEN BURDENED BY MANY LAWS MIGHT SIGH AND LONG FOR HIM THEIR REDEEMER THE SEED OF ABRAHAM
AND BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED IT THE FATHER LOVES YOU ON ANOTHER OCCASION JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES EVIL AND COMMANDED THEM TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO LOOK INTO YOUR OWN HEART AND IT WILL TELL YOU HOW YOU OUGHT TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF
NOW ALL THE PROMISES OF GOD LEAD BACK TO THE FIRST PROMISE CONCERNING CHRIST
IT WAS BUT A CONFERENCE AND NO DISPUTATION
AND WHY ART THOU DISQUIETED WITHIN ME
THIS IMPUTATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WE NEED VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE ARE FAR FROM PERFECT
BUT NOW MISLED BY THE FALSE APOSTLES THEY NO LONGER RUN
I ACCEPT JUSTIFY AND SAVE THEM
NO FLESH NOT EVEN THAT OF THE TRUE BELIEVER IS SO COMPLETELY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SPIRIT THAT IT WILL NOT BITE OR DEVOUR OR AT LEAST NEGLECT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE
HIS OPPONENTS WOULD NOT ACCEPT PAUL'S EXPLANATION
THE PROMISE WAS MADE UNTO ABRAHAM THOU SHALT BE A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS
THE WHITE DEVIL OF SPIRITUAL SIN IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE BLACK DEVIL OF CARNAL SIN BECAUSE THE WISER THE BETTER MEN ARE WITHOUT CHRIST THE MORE THEY ARE LIKELY TO IGNORE AND OPPOSE THE GOSPEL
4:24 THOSE WHO WALK AFTER THIS RULE ENJOY THE FAVOR OF GOD THE FORGIVENESS OF THEIR SINS AND PEACE OF CONSCIENCE
WHO SHALL DELIVER ME FROM THE BODY OF THIS DEATH THE SCHOLASTICS ARE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THIS CONFESSION OF PAUL AND FEEL OBLIGED TO SAVE HIS HONOR
NO ARTIST WITH ALL HIS COLORS COULD HAVE PICTURED CHRIST TO YOU AS VIVIDLY AS I HAVE PICTURED HIM TO YOU BY MY PREACHING
SHE THOUGHT
WE PREACH CHRIST CRUCIFIED UNTO THE JEWS A STUMBLING BLOCK AND UNTO THE GREEKS FOOLISHNESS
IF HE IS THE PRICE OF MY REDEMPTION IF HE WAS MADE SIN FOR MY JUSTIFICATION I DON'T GIVE A CARE IF YOU QUOTE ME A THOUSAND SCRIPTURE PASSAGES FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH
TO OVERCOME THE SIN OF A WHOLE WORLD AND DEATH AND THE WRATH OF GOD WAS NO WORK FOR ANY CREATURE
IF WE REMAIN SOUND IN THIS ONE ARTICLE WE REMAIN SOUND IN ALL THE OTHER ARTICLES OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
IT IS HIS NATURE TO EXALT THE HUMBLE TO COMFORT THE SORROWING TO HEAL THE BROKEN-HEARTED TO JUSTIFY THE SINNERS AND TO SAVE THE CONDEMNED
AT LEAST THE GALATIANS HAD MANIFESTED THE STRIKING FRUITS OF FAITH WHICH TRUE DISCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL MANIFESTED IN THOSE DAYS
DELIBERATELY TO COURT DANGER BY PREACHING AND CONFESSING THE TRUTH AND THUS TO BRING UPON OURSELVES THE HATRED AND ENMITY OF THE WHOLE WORLD IS THIS NOT MADNESS
THESE ARE GOOD WORKS
THE JEWS ASSERT THAT GOD WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS PROMISES BUT AFTER FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS HE GAVE THE LAW
BUT THE POPE WANTS TO BE ADORED HIMSELF AND THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT OFFENDING GOD
SAMSON DAVID AND MANY OTHER EXCELLENT MEN FELL INTO GRIEVOUS SINS
AND IN II CORINTHIANS 3:3 YE ARE THE EPISTLE OF CHRIST MINISTERED BY US WRITTEN NOT WITH INK BUT WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD THE WORD OF GOD FALLING FROM THE LIPS OF THE APOSTLE OR MINISTER ENTERS INTO THE HEART OF THE HEARER
YOU WOULD NOT CALL THIS BEING MADE RIGHTEOUS
THE LAW CAN ONLY AGGRAVATE THEIR WEAKNESS AND POVERTY
WE DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE PREACHING OF THE LAW IS WITHOUT VALUE BUT IT ONLY SERVES TO BRING HOME TO US THE WRATH OF GOD
WHY DO YOU NOT KEEP FAITH WITH GOD'S TESTAMENT THE APOSTLE SAYS THAT HE IS SPEAKING AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN
I HOPE THE BEST FOR YOU THE QUESTION OCCURS TO US WHETHER PAUL DID WELL TO TRUST THE GALATIANS
SIN STICKS IN OUR FLESH AND THE FLESH GETS US INTO SIN EVEN AFTER WE HAVE BEEN IMBUED BY THE HOLY GHOST
I THOUGHT CHRIST WAS A JUDGE AND HAD TO BE PACIFIED BY A STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE RULES OF MY ORDER
THERE ARE MANY PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE THAT DEAL WITH WORKS AND THE REWARD OF WORKS WHICH OUR OPPONENTS CITE AGAINST US IN THE BELIEF THAT THESE WILL DISPROVE THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH WHICH WE TEACH
WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF GOD
YOU KNOW THAT WE MAY EAT ALL KINDS OF MEATS
GOD IS NO LIAR
THE REASON WHY THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA CORINTH AND OTHER PLACES WERE TROUBLED BY FALSE APOSTLES WAS THIS THAT THEY HAD SO LITTLE REGARD FOR THEIR FAITHFUL MINISTERS
THE MERIT OF THY ORDER THE STRICTNESS OF THY RELIGION THE HUMILITY OF THY PROFESSION THE CONTRITION OF THY HEART THE GOOD WORKS THOU HAST DONE AND SHALT DO FOR THE LOVE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE AVAILABLE UNTO THEE FOR THE REMISSION OF THY SINS THE INCREASE OF THY WORTH AND GRACE AND THE REWARD OF EVERLASTING LIFE
IF YOUR SON IS TAKING THE SIN OF THE WORLD I SEE NO SINS ANYWHERE ELSE BUT IN HIM
THIS IS INDEED A MARVELOUS LIBERTY TO HAVE THE SOVEREIGN GOD FOR OUR FRIEND AND FATHER WHO WILL DEFEND MAINTAIN AND SAVE US IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE LIFE TO COME
PAUL REMINDS THE GALATIANS OF THIS
IS THE LAW THEN AGAINST THE PROMISES OF GOD
THIS IS AN IMPUDENT FALSEHOOD
BRETHREN I SPEAK AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN
HOW MUCH MORE WILL HE GRANT UNTO ME EVERLASTING LIFE AS A DUE PAYMENT IN RETURN FOR MY MANY GOOD DEEDS AND MERITS THIS IS THE RELIGION OF REASON
I CANNOT ALWAYS SHAKE OFF SATAN
IT WILL TEACH YOU TO APPRECIATE CHRIST HOW ANYBODY CAN SAY THAT HE BY NATURE LOVES THE LAW IS BEYOND ME
SIN CLINGS TO US AS LONG AS WE LIVE AND SPOILS OUR HAPPINESS IN CHRIST
DO NOT PERMIT YOURSELF TO BE ROBBED OF THIS LOVELY CONCEPTION OF CHRIST
THERE IS NO SIN NOW NO CURSE NO DEATH NO DEVIL BECAUSE CHRIST HAS DONE AWAY WITH THEM
THEY HAVE NO CARE FOR THE SAVING OF MEN'S SOULS
WHEN HE TOOK THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD UPON HIMSELF CHRIST WAS NO LONGER AN INNOCENT PERSON
TITUS WAS A FORMER GENTILE
THIS WAS NO EASY THING FOR HER TO DO
CALL UPON GOD GIVE THANKS UNTO HIM PRAISE HIM CONFESS HIM
TO HIDE IN CAVES AND DENS TO HAVE A BONY BODY TO WEAR THE HAIR LONG IN THE MISTAKEN IDEA THAT SUCH DEPARTURES FROM NORMALCY WILL OBTAIN SOME SPECIAL REGARD IN HEAVEN IS NOT THE HOLY LIFE
IF YOU BELIEVE IN CHRIST THEN ARE YOU THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM INDEED
THE OPPONENTS OF PAUL HAD HIS OWN EXAMPLE TO PREFER AGAINST HIM
THE CHRIST OF PETER PAUL AND ALL THE SAINTS IS OUR CHRIST
THE LAW THE OLD HUSBAND IS REALLY DEAD
HE DOES NOT SAY BY GOD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH WHO IS LORD OF THE ANGELS BUT PAUL HAS IN MIND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST AND SPEAKS TO THE POINT SAYING I AM AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN NEITHER BY MAN BUT BY JESUS CHRIST AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD VERSE 2
BLOTTING OUT THE HANDWRITING OF ORDINANCES THAT WAS AGAINST US WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO US AND TOOK IT OUT OF THE WAY NAILING IT TO HIS CROSS COL
THUS WE SHALL BE KEPT FROM CLIMBING INTO HEAVEN IN A CURIOUS AND FUTILE SEARCH AFTER THE NATURE OF GOD
IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE APOSTLES THAT AFTER THEY HAD TAUGHT FAITH AND INSTRUCTED THE CONSCIENCE THEY FOLLOWED IT UP WITH ADMONITIONS UNTO GOOD WORKS THAT THE BELIEVERS MIGHT MANIFEST THE DUTIES OF LOVE TOWARD EACH OTHER
BUT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THEY WILL FIND OUT THAT IT IS NO JOKE TO PERVERT THE TESTAMENT OF GOD
THE CHRISTIAN HAS A BODY IN WHOSE MEMBERS AS PAUL SAYS SIN DWELLS AND WARS
SHOUT O DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM
BRETHREN THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOUR SPIRIT
HE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK THE WHOLE MATTER AND NOT MAKE SUCH AN ISSUE OUT OF IT LEST THE UNITY OF THE CHURCHES BE DISTURBED TO THIS PAUL REPLIES
TO WHOM
ST AUGUSTINE SAYS
A LITTLE WHILE AGO PAUL CALLED MOUNT SINAI HAGAR
THE THIRD DAY CAME AND MOSES LED THE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR TENTS TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD
WHEN FAITH IN CHRIST IS OVERTHROWN PEACE AND UNITY COME TO AN END IN THE CHURCH
I AM THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR TROUBLES
I WENT TO JERUSALEM AT THE REQUEST OF GOD
LUKE REPORTS THE OCCASION IN THE NINTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK OF ACTS
DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
FOR CHRIST IS JOY AND SWEETNESS TO A BROKEN HEART
IF NOT GOD WILL BE ANGRY
IN OBSERVING THE LAW FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING RIGHTEOUSNESS WITHOUT FAITH IN CHRIST THESE LAW-WORKERS GO SMACK AGAINST THE LAW AND AGAINST GOD
MEEKNESS A PERSON IS MEEK WHEN HE IS NOT QUICK TO GET ANGRY
AND IF CHRIST IS NOT YET COME THEN ALL THE JEWISH CEREMONIES AND LAWS CONCERNING MEATS PLACES AND TIMES ARE STILL IN FORCE AND CHRIST MUST BE AWAITED AS ONE WHO IS STILL TO COME
AND IN WORST SHAPE WHEN IT IS AT PEACE
IT SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD AND THOU SHALT BRUISE HIS HEEL THE FAITH OF THE FATHERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT ERA AND OUR FAITH IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ARE ONE AND THE SAME FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS ALTHOUGH TIMES AND CONDITIONS MAY DIFFER
LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF BUT WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I SEEK NO MAN'S FAVOR BY MY DOCTRINE ASKS PAUL
AS A WILD BEAST IS TIED TO KEEP IT FROM RUNNING AMUCK SO THE LAW BRIDLES MAD AND FURIOUS MAN TO KEEP HIM FROM RUNNING WILD
WE ARE TOLD THAT OUR GLORYING IS IDLE VANITY AND UNADULTERATED BLASPHEMY
KNOWING SATAN'S GUILE PAUL SARDONICALLY CALLS THE DOCTRINE OF THE FALSE APOSTLES ANOTHER GOSPEL AS IF HE WOULD SAY YOU GALATIANS HAVE NOW ANOTHER GOSPEL WHILE MY GOSPEL IS NO LONGER ESTEEMED BY YOU WE INFER FROM THIS THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES HAD DEPRECIATED THE GOSPEL OF PAUL AMONG THE GALATIANS ON THE PLEA THAT IT WAS INCOMPLETE
SHOULD I NOW ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISH THE LAW AND SET UP THE RULE OF MOSES
YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS RESTS ON SOMETHING MUCH BETTER THAN FEELINGS
HE SPEAKS TO THEM AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREAT LOSS
THE LAW HAS A BOUNDARY BEYOND WHICH IT MUST NOT GO
FAITH CONCENTRATES ON THE TRUTH
RECEIVED YE THE HOLY GHOST BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW OR BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL THIS QUESTION GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE CONTRADICTED THEM
LET US CONFESS WITH PAUL THAT ALL OUR WORK-RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LOSS AND DUNG
A PLAIN FACTORY HAND WHO DOES HIS WORK FAITHFULLY PLEASES GOD JUST AS MUCH AS A MINISTER OF THE WORD
HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT
THROUGH OUR FAITH IN CHRIST ABRAHAM GAINS PATERNITY OVER US AND OVER THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE
IT HOLDS OUT TO MEN ETERNAL GIFTS THAT ARE NOT GIFTS OF OUR OWN MANUFACTURE
NOT ONE TRUE BELIEVER WHOM THE FLESH DOES NOT AGAIN AND AGAIN INCITE TO IMPATIENCE ANGER PRIDE
STRICKEN BY THE TERROR OF GOD THEY FLED BACK INTO THEIR TENTS AS IF THE DEVIL WERE AFTER THEM
BUT WE KNOW NOW FROM THE SCRIPTURES WHO THE TRUE SAINTS ARE
BUT NOW THAT THE GOSPEL IS HERE YOU DO NOT HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE GOSPEL DRIVES THE DEVIL AWAY
THESE MARKS WERE GIVEN TO ME AGAINST MY WILL AS DECORATIONS FROM THE DEVIL AND FOR NO OTHER MERIT BUT THAT I MADE KNOWN JESUS OF THE MARKS OF SUFFERING WHICH HE BORE IN HIS BODY THE APOSTLE MAKES FREQUENT MENTION IN HIS EPISTLES
I DESIRE TO BE PRESENT WITH YOU NOW AND TO CHANGE MY VOICE
WE ARE BOLD TO CURSE AND CONDEMN ALL MEN WHO IN THE LEAST POINT CORRUPT THE WORD OF GOD FOR A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENETH THE WHOLE LUMP PAUL DOES RIGHT TO CURSE THESE TROUBLERS OF THE GALATIANS WISHING THAT THEY WERE CUT OFF AND ROOTED OUT OF THE CHURCH OF GOD AND THAT THEIR DOCTRINE MIGHT PERISH FOREVER
WHY THEN LET US REJECT THE LAW
THE FIRST STEP ON THE WAY TO SALVATION IS TO REPENT
ISHMAEL BY HAGAR AND ISAAC BY SARAH
WHAT PROFIT IS THERE IN FASTING PRAYING ETC IF ANY MAN OR WOMAN ANY BEGGAR OR SCOUR WOMAN IS TO BE MADE EQUAL TO US OR EVEN BE CONSIDERED MORE ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD THAN WE REASON TAKES OFFENSE AT THE STATEMENT OF PAUL
HE DID NOT ALWAYS ENTERTAIN THE SWEET AND GLAD EXPECTATION OF HIS HEAVENLY INHERITANCE
THE MORE I SOUGHT TO HELP MY POOR STRICKEN CONSCIENCE THE WORSE IT GOT
THE APOSTLE PAUL KNEW WHAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE TEACHING THE GALATIANS
IT WAS TO THEM A SIGN AND SEAL OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
HE DOES NOT ONLY BEWITCH MEN IN A CRUDE MANNER BUT ALSO IN A MORE ARTFUL FASHION
PAUL DESCRIBES THESE STIFF AND UNGRACIOUS SAINTS ACCURATELY WHEN HE SAYS OF THEM THEY THINK THEMSELVES TO BE SOMETHING BLOATED BY THEIR OWN SILLY IDEAS AND SCHEMES THEY ENTERTAIN A PRETTY FAIR OPINION OF THEMSELVES WHEN IN REALITY THEY AMOUNT TO NOTHING
AND BY HIM ALL THAT BELIEVE ARE JUSTIFIED FROM ALL THINGS FROM WHICH YE COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW OF MOSES ACTS 13:39 ALWAYS REMEMBERING THE WEAK PAUL DID NOT INSIST THAT THEY BREAK AT ONCE WITH THE LAW
SARAH THE CHURCH AS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST BEARS FREE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW
THEREFORE LET US WATCH OVER OURSELVES AND OVER THE WHOLE CHURCH
IN REFRAINING FROM MURDER ADULTERY THEFT OR OTHER SINS I DO SO UNDER COMPULSION BECAUSE I FEAR THE JAIL THE NOOSE THE ELECTRIC CHAIR
THEY KNEW THEN AS THEY KNOW NOW THAT OURS IS THE SINGULAR DESIRE TO PUBLISH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST EVERYWHERE
AND THIS THE APOSTLE PROVES BY THE TESTIMONY OF ISAIAH WHO BIDS THE BARREN TO REJOICE BECAUSE SHE WILL HAVE MANY CHILDREN WHEREAS SHE THAT HAS A HUSBAND AND MANY CHILDREN WILL BE FORSAKEN
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL FOR PRAISE IS BAD BUSINESS ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE STOP PRAISING YOU
THE LAW WAS HANDED DOWN BY A BEING EVEN INFERIOR TO THE ANGELS BY A MIDDLEMAN NAMED MOSES
GOD ALONE IS ABLE TO DELIVER US FROM THE WORLD
WHICH GOES TO SHOW THAT NEITHER THE FALSE APOSTLES NOR THE GALATIANS WALKED AFTER THE SPIRIT BUT AFTER THE FLESH
I AM A SAVIOR
CIVIL LAWS AND ORDINANCES HAVE THEIR PLACE AND PURPOSE
THAT ANTICHRISTS WOULD COME CHRIST HIMSELF PROPHESIED MATTHEW 24:5 FOR MANY SHALL COME IN MY NAME SAYING I AM CHRIST
WHEN THE LAW ACCUSES HIM AND SIN WANTS TO DRIVE THE WITS OUT OF HIM A CHRISTIAN LOOKS TO CHRIST
ODDLY ENOUGH THE FALSE APOSTLES WHO WERE SUCH EARNEST CHAMPIONS OF GOOD WORKS NEVER REQUIRED THE WORK OF CHARITY SUCH AS CHRISTIAN LOVE AND THE PRACTICAL CHARITY OF A HELPFUL TONGUE HAND AND HEART
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT THE GALATIANS TAUGHT AS THEY WERE BY THAT EFFICIENT APOSTLE AND TEACHER PAUL COULD SO QUICKLY BE LED ASTRAY BY THE FALSE APOSTLES
WHEN THE LAW EXERCISES ITS HIGHER FUNCTION IT ACCUSES AND CONDEMNS THE CONSCIENCE
HE STRIKES DOWN KINGS PRINCES ALL MEN
HERE AGAIN THE APOSTLE EXCUSES THE GALATIANS WHILE HE BLAMES THE FALSE APOSTLES FOR DISTURBING THEIR CONSCIENCES AND FOR STEALING THEM OUT OF HIS HAND
HE DOES NOT REGRET THE CRIME THAT PUT HIM IN JAIL
THE CERTAINTY OF OUR CALLING EVERY MINISTER SHOULD MAKE MUCH OF HIS CALLING AND IMPRESS UPON OTHERS THE FACT THAT HE HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY GOD TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
WE KNOW THAT WE SUFFER THESE THINGS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THIEVES AND MURDERERS BUT FOR CHRIST'S SAKE WHOSE GOSPEL WE PROCLAIM
BUT THESE PRETENDED SAINTS SO FAR FROM ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR ERRORS JUSTIFY THEM AND REGARD THEM AS ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICES UNTO GOD
WHAT KIND OF RIGHTEOUSNESS DO YOU CALL THAT WHEN PEOPLE RUN AWAY FROM IT AND HATE IT THE WORST WAY
HE HATES IT
THE TREE MAKES THE APPLE
BUT THE AUTHORS OF THIS DERANGED IDEA WERE FREQUENTLY DRIVEN TO DESPAIR IN THE HOUR OF DEATH
GENTLENESS IS ALWAYS GLAD TO GIVE IN TO OTHERS
THE LAW BROUGHT ALL ITS FRIGHT TO BEAR UPON CHRIST UNTIL HE EXPERIENCED ANGUISH AND TERROR SUCH AS NOBODY ELSE EVER EXPERIENCED
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE OBSTINACY WITH WHICH ROMANISTS CLING TO THEIR TRADITIONS WE CAN VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THE ZEALOUS DEVOTION OF THE JEWS FOR THE LAW
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD TEAR EVERYTHING TO PIECES
BY SACRIFICING HIS SON FOR US GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO US AS A MERCIFUL FATHER WHO DONATES REMISSION OF SINS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE EVERLASTING FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
HIS BLOODY SWEAT
I KNOW THAT I TEACH THE TRUTH OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS WHEN I FIRST TOOK OVER THE DEFENSE OF THE GOSPEL I REMEMBERED WHAT DOCTOR STAUPITZ SAID TO ME
I KNOW I HAVE COMMITTED MANY SINS AND I CONTINUE TO SIN DAILY
FAITH IN CHRIST WHICH IS A GIFT OF GOD
THAT YE SHOULD NOT OBEY THE TRUTH
IS IT NOT AMAZING CRIES PAUL THAT YOU GALATIANS WHO KNEW GOD INTIMATELY BY THE HEARING OF THE GOSPEL SHOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN REVERT FROM THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WILL IN WHICH I THOUGHT YOU WERE CONFIRMED TO THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE LAW WHICH CAN ONLY ENSLAVE YOU AGAIN VERSE 9
WHEN PETER PREACHED CHRIST AT THE FIRST PENTECOST THE HOLY GHOST FELL UPON THE HEARERS AND THE SAME DAY THERE WERE ADDED UNTO THEM ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SOULS CORNELIUS RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST WHILE PETER WAS SPEAKING OF CHRIST
THEY THEMSELVES PREACHED AND PERFORMED MIRACLES WHILE CHRIST WAS ON EARTH
WE MUST KNOW THAT WE ARE NOTHING
I ALWAYS SAY THERE IS NO REMEDY AGAINST THE SECTS NO POWER TO RESIST THEM EXCEPT THIS ARTICLE OF CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS
WE WEAR OUR BODIES OUT WITH WATCHING FASTING AND LABOR AND NEGLECT CHARITY THE QUEEN OF ALL GOOD WORKS LOOK AT THE MONKS WHO METICULOUSLY FAST WATCH ETC
IF A MAN'S LAST WILL IS RESPECTED AND IT IS HOW MUCH MORE OUGHT THE TESTAMENT OF GOD BE HONORED
THIS FACT O GALATIANS SHOULD HAVE PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST THESE DECEIVERS WHO MAKE SO MUCH OF THE LAW
TO BLESS SIMPLY MEANS TO SPREAD ABROAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST'S SALVATION
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND KILLED FOR US
TRUE RELIGION IS EVER IN NEED OF MONEY WHILE FALSE RELIGIONS ARE BACKED BY WEALTH
WE WHO ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH AS THE SAINTS OF OLD MAY BE UNDER THE LAW BUT WE ARE NOT UNDER THE CURSE OF THE LAW BECAUSE SIN IS NOT IMPUTED TO US FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
THE LAW MAKES AFFLICTED CONSCIENCES HUNGRY FOR CHRIST
IF THE FATHER OBTAINED RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH FAITH THE CHILDREN GET IT THE SAME WAY
A COMMON SAYING HAS IT THAT A LETTER IS A DEAD MESSENGER
BUT HOW LONG ARE THE SCOLDING AND THE WHIPPINGS OF THE SCHOOLMASTER TO CONTINUE
FOR I STAND IN DOUBT OF YOU
IT ALLOWS YOU TO ARGUE LIKE THIS
NOW HE SAYS IF THERE ARE ANY OTHERS WHO PREACH A GOSPEL DIFFERENT FROM THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM US LET THEM ALSO BE ACCURSED PAUL HEREWITH CURSES AND EXCOMMUNICATES ALL FALSE TEACHERS INCLUDING HIS OPPONENTS
THEY SHALL HAVE NO INHERITANCE WITH THE CHILDREN OF THE PROMISE
I THOUGHT OF JOHN HUSS AS A CURSED HERETIC
A NEW CREATURE IS ONE IN WHOM THE IMAGE OF GOD HAS BEEN RENEWED
WITHOUT FAITH GOD FORFEITS HIS GLORY WISDOM TRUTH AND MERCY IN US
WHERE THE CHURCH IS THERE MUST BE THE POOR FOR THE WORLD AND THE DEVIL PERSECUTE THE CHURCH AND IMPOVERISH MANY FAITHFUL CHRISTIANS
BE INSTANT IN SEASON OUT OF SEASON
THE FLESH RESISTS THE SPIRIT OR AS PAUL PUTS IT THE FLESH LUSTETH AGAINST THE SPIRIT THEREFORE WE TEACH THAT TO KNOW CHRIST AND TO BELIEVE IN HIM IS NO ACHIEVEMENT OF MAN BUT THE GIFT OF GOD
PETER ALSO ERRED IN THIS MATTER OF CIRCUMCISION
CHRIST WAS MADE SIN ITSELF
THE BLESSING IS THE PROMISE OF THE GOSPEL
THIS HOLDS TRUE ALSO IN REGARD TO THE CHURCH REGULATIONS
130:3 NO MAN IS TO DESPAIR OF SALVATION JUST BECAUSE HE IS AWARE OF THE LUST OF THE FLESH
PAUL'S WORDS CONTAIN THE IMPLICATION OF CONTRAST
FAITH TAKES HOLD OF CHRIST
ON THE OTHER HAND HOPE WITHOUT FAITH IS BLIND RASHNESS AND ARROGANCE BECAUSE IT LACKS KNOWLEDGE
IF THERE HAD BEEN A LAW GIVEN THERE IS NO LAW BY WHICH RIGHTEOUSNESS MAY BE OBTAINED NOT A SINGLE ONE
BUT BE OF GOOD CHEER
THE PAPISTS REVIVE THEIR OLD ABOMINATIONS
NEXT HOLY WRIT CONCLUDES ALL UNDER SIN IN THIS PASSAGE FROM PAUL
WE ALL HAVE ONE AND THE SAME GOSPEL ONE FAITH ONE BAPTISM ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL ONE CHRIST AND SAVIOR OF ALL
I CANNOT TELL YOU IN WORDS HOW CRIMINAL IT IS TO SEEK RIGHTEOUSNESS BEFORE GOD WITHOUT FAITH IN CHRIST BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
I HAVE NOT PREACHED TO THE END THAT I BUILD AGAIN THE THINGS WHICH I DESTROYED
WHOSOEVER TEACHES A GOSPEL CONTRARY TO OURS OR DIFFERENT FROM OURS LET US BE BOLD TO SAY THAT HE IS SENT OF THE DEVIL
THEY ONLY TROUBLE YOU
HE KNEW THAT THE DEVIL DELIGHTS IN TAKING THIS LIBERTY AWAY FROM US
BUT THE SPIRIT ITSELF MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US WITH GROANINGS WHICH CANNOT BE UTTERED THE FACT THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IN OUR HEARTS CRIES UNTO GOD AND MAKES INTERCESSION FOR US WITH GROANINGS SHOULD REASSURE US GREATLY
THEY DID NOT LIKE IT AND BECAME SORE AT US BECAUSE IT HURT THEIR PRIDE
I ANSWER
I ANSWER
I ANSWER
I ANSWER
I ANSWER
IN CONCLUSION IF THE LAW IS THE MINISTER OF SIN IT IS AT THE SAME TIME THE MINISTER OF WRATH AND DEATH
VERSE 4
VERSE 4
VERSE 4
VERSE 4
VERSE 4
THE WORLD IN TURN DETESTS MY DOCTRINE AND CONDEMNS ME AS A REVOLUTIONARY HERETIC
MR LAW GO AHEAD AND ACCUSE ME AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE
WHEN THE GOSPEL IS PREACHED UNTO FAITH HOPE LOVE AND PATIENCE GOD GIVES HIS WONDER-WORKING SPIRIT
BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH GOD EXTENDS TO HIM THE PROMISE
IN THE SENSE OF EMOTION WE QUOTE THE PASSAGE FROM THE EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
A REPENTANT SINNER IS NOT TO BE GIVEN GALL AND VINEGAR TO DRINK
YOU FEEL SIN
I HAVE BEEN ASSAILED BY MANY VIOLENT PASSIONS BUT AS SOON AS I TOOK HOLD OF SOME SCRIPTURE PASSAGE MY TEMPTATIONS LEFT ME
CAIN REMAINED IN THE PRISON OF THE LAW AND DESPAIRED
WHO ARE THE OTHER SINNERS
THE DEMANDS OF THE LAW MAY BE FULFILLED BEFORE AND AFTER JUSTIFICATION
NOT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS ALTHOUGH THEY GIVE THAT IMPRESSION BUT THAT THEY MAY GLORY IN YOUR FLESH NOW WHAT SORT OF AN AMBITION IS THAT
ALL THAT THE LORD HATH SPOKEN WE WILL DO EX
THE CURSE STRUCK HIM
IN SHORT THEY ARE NO GOOD AT-ALL THOUGH OUTWARDLY THEY SEEM TO BE EXTREMELY SOLICITOUS OF THE HONOR OF GOD
WITCHCRAFT THIS SIN WAS VERY COMMON BEFORE THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL APPEARED
NOT SATISFIED WITH TEACHING AN UNTRUE GOSPEL THE FALSE APOSTLES TRIED TO ENTANGLE PAUL
11:6 SURELY IT IS NO EASY THING TO CONFESS HIM LORD OF ALL AND SAVIOR OF THE WORLD WHO WAS A REPROACH OF MEN AND DESPISED OF THE PEOPLE AND THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE WORLD
SO DO THE PAPISTS
THOSE WHO LAPSE FROM THE GOSPEL TO THE LAW ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN THOSE WHO LAPSE FROM GRACE INTO IDOLATRY
FIRST THEY TORTURE THEMSELVES ON EARTH WITH SELF-INFLICTED PENANCES AND FINALLY WHEN THEY DIE THEY GAIN THE REWARD OF ETERNAL DAMNATION
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS HIS DUTY TO REPROVE PETER AND HIS FOLLOWERS FOR SWERVING FROM THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
IT IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE CIRCUMCISED DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS AND FREE FROM THE LAW
THE LETTER TO THE GALATIANS CONSISTS OF SIX SHORT CHAPTERS
PAUL MAINTAINS THAT THERE IS NO OTHER GOSPEL BESIDES THE ONE HE HAD PREACHED TO THE GALATIANS
THEY MOCK GOD AND PROVOKE HIS ANGER
THE FACT IS WE CHRISTIANS KNOW BETTER WHAT CONSTITUTES A TRULY GOOD WORK THAN ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS AND LEGISLATORS OF THE WORLD BECAUSE WE LINK BELIEVING WITH DOING
BUT WE GO FREE
ISAIAH 54:1 HE APPLIES THIS PROPHECY TO HAGAR AND SARAH TO THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE A CHRISTIAN MUST HAVE THE INSIGHT OF FAITH SO THAT THE INTELLECT MAY KNOW ITS DIRECTIONS IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE AND THE HEART MAY HOPE FOR BETTER THINGS
IN HIS TABLE TALKS THE SAYING IS RECORDED
HE CONDENSES ALL THE LAWS OF MOSES INTO ONE BRIEF SENTENCE
THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN I FIND FAULT WITH GOD AND AM IMPATIENT WITH HIM
I WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THIS TURN OF THE ALLEGORY
WE MERELY JUDGE THEM BY THE TOUCHSTONE OF GOD'S WORD RECORDED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS EPISTLE
THE BETTER ONES DEPLORE AND ABHOR IT
AND YET THIS ATROCITY IS ALL TOO COMMON
WHO THROUGH FAITH SUBDUED KINGDOMS WROUGHT RIGHTEOUSNESS OBTAINED PROMISES STOPPED THE MOUTHS OF LIONS HEBREWS 11:33 IN THIS WAY WILL WE CORRECTLY INTERPRET ALL THOSE PASSAGES THAT SEEM TO SUPPORT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS
GO TO IT FLESH AND RAGE ALL YOU WANT TO
DO YOU NOTICE HOW WELL SUITED TO HIS PURPOSE PAUL WRITES
YOU I SAY WHO ARE YOUNG MAY LEARN TO KNOW CHRIST IN ALL HIS SWEETNESS
IN ORDER TO BE A CHILD OF THE BELIEVING ABRAHAM YOU MUST BELIEVE AS HE DID
BUT ONCE INSIDE THE MONASTERY THE RECRUITS ARE TOLD TO DOUBT THE PROMISES OF GOD
WE ARE NOT TO THINK THAT THE LAW IS WIPED OUT
THE APOSTLES LIVED WITH CHRIST FOR THREE YEARS
UNLESS YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS YOU DO CHRIST A GREAT WRONG FOR HE HAS CLEANSED YOU BY THE WASHING OF REGENERATION HE DIED FOR YOU SO THAT THROUGH HIM YOU MAY OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND EVERLASTING LIFE
THIS FACT IS SURE
DREGS OF THE OLD AND NATURAL CORRUPTION REMAIN
BUT THESE ARE THE CRAFTY PASSES OF THE DEVIL WITH WHICH HE SEEKS TO OVERTHROW OUR FAITH
THERE ARE TWO CLASSES OF DOERS OF THE LAW TRUE DOERS AND HYPOCRITICAL DOERS
WE DO WHAT WE CAN WE DILIGENTLY ADMONISH THEM TO LOVE AND TO HELP THEIR FELLOW-MEN
THE LAW IS A PRISON TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT AS YET OBTAINED GRACE
THESE TWO THE SIN OF THE WORLD AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD MET IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
THE APOSTLE DECLARES EMPHATICALLY THAT THE LAW OF ITSELF CANNOT SAVE
THERE IS A TOUCH OF IRONY IN THESE WORDS OF THE APOSTLE
TAKE THE CASE OF NAAMAN THE SYRIAN WHO WAS A GENTILE AND DID NOT BELONG TO THE RACE OF MOSES
AS LONG AS WE PREACH CHRIST AND CONFESS HIM TO BE OUR SAVIOR WE MUST BE CONTENT TO BE CALLED VICIOUS TROUBLE MAKERS
HE WILL FORGIVE OUR SINS AS THOUGH THEY AMOUNT TO NOTHING AT ALL
THEY WERE EQUALS
THEY CLAIM ABRAHAM'S FAITH HAD NO MORE IN IT THAN A BELIEF IN THE PROMISE OF GOD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SEED
HEAPING MERCY UPON MERCY HE FREELY FORGAVE MY SINS REPLENISHING ME WITH HIS GRACE TO ENABLE ME TO LEARN WHAT GREAT THINGS ARE OURS IN CHRIST
IT WAS RESOLVED THAT THE GENTILES SHOULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO BE CIRCUMCISED
THEY ARE BY NATURE THE CHILDREN OF WRATH
BUT THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO YOU ARE EITHER CALLED OF MEN OR BY MAN
143:2 AGAIN IF THOU LORD SHOULDEST MARK INIQUITIES O LORD WHO SHALL STAND PS
YOU SCARED HIM GOOD AND PROPER NOW IT IS THE GOSPEL'S TURN
BURDENED WITH THE SINS OF A PETER WHO DENIED CHRIST
AS DANGEROUS TO THE CHURCH AS THIS ABOMINABLE PRIDE IS YET THERE IS NOTHING MORE COMMON
THE SCHOLASTICS ADMIT THAT A MERE EXTERNAL AND SUPERFICIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW WITHOUT SINCERITY AND GOOD WILL IS PLAIN HYPOCRISY
AUGUSTINE UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE SOMEWHAT
THAT THE DEAD SHALL RISE
IN THE WORLD TRUTH PRODUCES HATRED
THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
FAITH IN GOD CONSTITUTES THE HIGHEST WORSHIP THE PRIME DUTY THE FIRST OBEDIENCE AND THE FOREMOST SACRIFICE
HE IS BORN A SON AND AN HEIR
THE APOSTLE NEXT ADDUCES THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM AND REVIEWS THE TESTIMONY OF THE SCRIPTURES CONCERNING FAITH
THIS HURTS MORE THAN THE PERSECUTION OF TYRANTS
WE NOW HEAR WHAT KIND OF DOCTRINE WAS COMMITTED TO PAUL
PAUL MEANT TO REMEDY THIS EVIL
BUT THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM IS SARAH THE FREE WOMAN
BUT THE PAPISTS APPLY IT TO THE SPIRITUAL REALM WHERE A PERSON CAN PERFORM NOTHING BUT SIN BECAUSE HE IS SOLD UNDER SIN
YET FOR SALVATION THEY GRASP AT THE STRAW OF THE LAW
WHAT THEY EXCLAIM SHOULD THIS HEATHEN BE JUSTIFIED WITHOUT THE LAW
WHERE CHRIST IS NEAR THE POWERS OF EVIL MUST KEEP THEIR DISTANCE
WHEN HE IS HIT YOU WILL KNOW IT BY THE HAVOC HE RAISES EVERYWHERE
I WILL JOIN THIS OR THAT ORDER
THIS IS WRONG
BUT NOW THAT SIN AND DEATH ARE REVEALED TO HIM BY THE LAW HE WISHES THERE WERE NO GOD
FOR THEY WHO SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT IN CONFERENCE ADDED NOTHING TO ME
THERE THE LAW CANNOT FOLLOW YOU LEAVE THE ASS BURDENED WITH LAWS BEHIND IN THE VALLEY
THE LAW COULD NOT CANCEL THE PROMISE BECAUSE THE PROMISE WAS THE TESTAMENT OF GOD CONFIRMED BY GOD IN CHRIST MANY YEARS BEFORE THE LAW
NEVERTHELESS GOD KNOWS YOU OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GOD IS RATHER PASSIVE THAN ACTIVE
IN DEFENSE OF THAT CAUSE WE MUST BE FIRM AND UNYIELDING
IF OUR OPPONENTS ARE SO UNCERTAIN ABOUT THEIR STATUS WITH GOD AND EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE CONSCIENCE OUGHT TO BE KEPT IN A STATE OF DOUBT WHY IS IT THAT THEY PERSECUTE US AS VILE HERETICS
MANY A TIME WE WERE WRESTLED DOWN IN THESE CONFLICTS WITH SATAN BUT CHRIST HAS ALWAYS TRIUMPHED AND ALWAYS WILL TRIUMPH
JOB AND JEREMIAH CURSED THE DAY OF THEIR BIRTH
ON THE CONTRARY HE NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE REQUIRES YOUR LOVING ATTENTION
HE WISHES HE COULD SEE THE GALATIANS IN PERSON AND STRAIGHTEN OUT THEIR DIFFICULTIES
TO ENDOW THE LAW WITH ANY CAPACITY TO PRODUCE RIGHTEOUSNESS IS TO PLAGIARIZE THE GOSPEL
YOU DO NOT LIVE WELL
2:3 CHRIST HOWEVER DID NO SIN NEITHER WAS GUILE FOUND IN HIS MOUTH I PET
THEY MISREPRESENT HIM AS A THREATENING TYRANT WHO IS READY TO SLAUGHTER US AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION
TO ESCAPE THE CHARGE OF FORGERY THEY ALWAYS HAVE THEIR CONVENIENT ANNOTATION HANDY THAT PAUL IS REFERRING ONLY TO THE CEREMONIAL AND NOT TO THE MORAL LAW
THE POPE COMMANDS US TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE PROMISES OF GOD IN CHRIST TO OUR OWN MERIT
THE OLD TESTAMENT IS REPLETE WITH EXAMPLES THAT INDICATE HOW MUCH GOD PRIZES CHARITY
AT FIRST YES MANY WERE DELIGHTED WITH OUR DOCTRINE AND RECEIVED IT GLADLY
IT IS THE DUTY OF A CHRISTIAN PASTOR TO REPROVE THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE
THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION IS INDEED FUNDAMENTAL
OUR CERTAINTY IS OF CHRIST THAT MIGHTY HERO WHO OVERCAME THE LAW SIN DEATH AND ALL EVILS
HE BOWED HIS KNEES BEFORE GOD AND GAVE THANKS LIKE THE PHARISEE
SOMEBODY ELSE SAVED ME FROM THE LAW FROM SIN AND DEATH UNTO ETERNAL LIFE
THE LAW HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL ME THAT I MUST BE JUSTIFIED BY IT
WHAT IF WE DID DEVIATE A LITTLE FROM THE DOCTRINE OF PAUL
THE PAPISTS WILL TELL YOU TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN AND GOD WILL GIVE YOU HIS GRACE
BLESSED IS HE WHOSOEVER SHALL NOT BE OFFENDED IN ME MATT
ABBA FATHER AND THIS LITTLE CRY OF THE SPIRIT TRANSCENDS THE HULLABALOO OF THE LAW SIN DEATH AND THE DEVIL AND FINDS A HEARING WITH GOD
WE OUGHT TO SAY TO THE LAW
COULD NOT GOD REVOKE HIS LAW
OVERSHARP CRITICISM PROVOKES ANGER AND DESPAIR BUT NO REPENTANCE
WHEN THE JEWS REFUSED TO HEAR THESE GLAD TIDINGS PAUL TURNED TO THE GENTILES
TO FINISH WITH THIS VERSE
THE LAW IS A SPECIALIST TO BRING US TO CHRIST
WITH PAUL WE ABSOLUTELY DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF MERIT
WHY TEMPT YE GOD TO PUT A YOKE UPON THE NECK OF THE DISCIPLES WHICH NEITHER OUR FATHERS NOR WE WERE ABLE TO BEAR ACTS 15:10 IN THIS PASSAGE PAUL AGAIN DISPARAGES THE PERNICIOUS NOTION THAT THE LAW IS ABLE TO MAKE MEN RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD A NOTION DEEPLY ROOTED IN MAN'S REASON
THE WORDS OF PAUL AND WOULD PERVERT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST ALSO INDICATE HOW ARROGANT THESE FALSE APOSTLES WERE
AS WITCHES USED TO BEWITCH CATTLE AND MEN SO IDOLATERS I.E ALL THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS GO AROUND TO BEWITCH GOD AND TO MAKE HIM OUT AS ONE WHO JUSTIFIES MEN NOT BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST BUT BY THE WORKS OF MEN'S OWN CHOOSING
DID NOT CHRIST SAY THAT UNBELIEVERS ARE ALREADY DAMNED
THE SCHOLASTICS MISCONSTRUE THIS PASSAGE BY SAYING
THIS IS PAUL'S VERY OWN COMPLAINT AND THE IDENTICAL COMPLAINT OF ALL BELIEVERS
WE MAGNIFY THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD AND FAITH
IF THOU WILT ENTER INTO LIFE KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS MATT
AND THAT WOULD LEAVE ME OUT
55:15 THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS NOW COME ALL KINDS OF ADMONITIONS AND PRECEPTS
WHO CARES WHETHER OUR EFFORTS PLEASE OR DISPLEASE THE DEVIL
WE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND BY IDLY AND SEE SUCH A COMFORTING STATEMENT AS THIS EXPLAINED AWAY
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED
BECAUSE THERE WERE NO GRAVES IN EGYPT HAST THOU TAKEN US AWAY TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS
AND CALLED ME BY HIS GRACE
WE SAYS PAUL ARE ABOVE SUCH THINGS
FIND YOUR PRAISE IN THE TESTIMONY OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE
109:4 LET US NEVER DOUBT THE MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS BUT MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT GOD IS PLEASED WITH US THAT HE LOOKS AFTER US AND THAT WE HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO PRAYS FOR US
WHEN WE BELIEVE IN CHRIST WE LIVE BY FAITH
THY TERRORS HAVE CUT ME OFF PSALM 88 16 BY CHRIST'S SALVATION WE HAVE BEEN DELIVERED FROM THE TERRORS OF GOD TO A LIFE OF ETERNAL FELICITY
MOSES REQUIRES PERFECT DOERS OF THE LAW
COMING TO A CITY PAUL CUSTOMARILY ENTERED THE SYNAGOGUES OF THE JEWS AND FIRST BROUGHT TO THEM AS THE CHILDREN OF THE KINGDOM THE GLAD TIDINGS THAT THE PROMISES MADE UNTO THE FATHERS WERE FULFILLED IN JESUS CHRIST
WOULD YOU CALL THIS BEING JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW
PAUL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THEIR DEMANDS
HOW SO
THIS IS A HEBREW EXPRESSION MEANING TO SANCTIFY ORDAIN PREPARE
I HAVE THE LAW I HAVE NO LAW WHEN WE LOOK AT OURSELVES WE FIND PLENTY OF SIN
WE NEED HIS PRAYERS
NO PERSON CAN HOPE TO UNDERSTAND PAUL UNLESS HE UNDERSTANDS THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION
THE GOSPEL BRINGS DONATIONS
BUT HOW WILL I GET RID OF MY SIN HE WILL ASK
NO MATTER HOW WELL A PERSON SAYS OR DOES ANYTHING THEY WILL FIND FAULT WITH IT AND IF YOU DO NOT HUMOR THEM YOU CAN NEVER PLEASE THEM
IN PHILIPPIANS 3:20 THE APOSTLE USES THE PHRASE
YOU ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM HIM SO MUCH SO THAT HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU ANY MORE OR FOR THAT MATTER YOU WITH HIM CAN ANYTHING WORSE BE SAID AGAINST THE LAW
SIN IS AN EXACTING DESPOT WHO CAN BE VANQUISHED BY NO CREATED POWER BUT BY THE SOVEREIGN POWER OF JESUS CHRIST ALONE
THE MINISTER OF THE LETTER AND THE MINISTER OF THE SPIRIT
BUT THROUGH CHRIST A WEAK AND POOR SINNER IS REVIVED AND ENRICHED UNTO ETERNAL LIFE
HE SHALL DIE ON THE CROSS AND THE LAW KILLS CHRIST
GO AHEAD AND CARRY YOUR BURDEN
HE GETS OUR SINS WE GET HIS HOLINESS
SYRIA AND CILICIA ARE ADJACENT COUNTRIES
THE LAW CAN NEVER JUSTIFY AND SAVE A SINNER
OF PETER IT IS RECORDED THAT HE WEPT WHENEVER HE REMEMBERED THE SWEET GENTLENESS OF CHRIST IN HIS DAILY CONTACT WITH PEOPLE
HE UTTERS THE THREATENING WORDS GOD IS NOT MOCKED OUR COUNTRYMEN THINK IT GOOD SPORT TO DESPISE THE MINISTRY
WHO DID HINDER YOU THAT YE SHOULD NOT OBEY THE TRUTH
WHO DID HINDER YOU THAT YE SHOULD NOT OBEY THE TRUTH
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
HE SAYS
VERSE 5
VERSE 5
VERSE 5
THE SCRIPTURE EXPLICITLY STATES ABRAHAM'S GRIEF IN THE WORDS
MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE THE LECTURES WHICH ARE PRESERVED IN THE WORKS HEREWITH SUBMITTED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WERE DELIVERED IN 1531
REJOICE IN THE LORD ALWAYS CHRIST SAYS
AND THE POPE IS THE SOLE AUTHOR OF THIS INIQUITY
THOSE WHO RELY UPON SUCH THINGS DO SERVE A GOD BUT IT IS THEIR OWN INVENTION OF A GOD AND NOT THE TRUE GOD
IF WE SIN WE SIN NOT ON PURPOSE BUT UNWITTINGLY AND WE ARE SORRY FOR IT
THEIR HOLINESS IS A GIFT AND NOT THEIR OWN PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT
VERSE 3
VERSE 3
VERSE 3
VERSE 3
VERSE 3
THIS SHOWS HOW LITTLE INSIGHT THE POPE AND THE WHOLE OF HIS RELIGIOUS COTERIE HAVE INTO SPIRITUAL MATTERS AND HOW LITTLE THEY CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE SPIRITUAL HEALTH OF THEIR FORLORN FLOCKS
HOW LONG OUGHT THE LAW TO HOLD SWAY
BUT IF WHILE WE SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST WE OURSELVES ALSO ARE FOUND SINNERS IS THEREFORE CHRIST THE MINISTER OF SIN
THIS ONLY WOULD I LEARN OF YOU RECEIVED YE THE SPIRIT BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW OR BY THE HEARING OF FAITH
UNDER THE BANEFUL INFLUENCE OF THE FALSE APOSTLES THE GALATIANS THOUGHT THEY WERE WELL OFF AND ADVANCING RAPIDLY IN CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE AND LIVING
HE DID NOT THINK IT QUITE ENOUGH TO SAY THAT HE WAS AN APOSTLE BY JESUS CHRIST
SUCH FAITH IN PEOPLE THEREFORE IS QUITE NECESSARY
I AM DOING THIS IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND THAT THE SILLY CEREMONIES OF WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES MAKE SO MUCH ARE FAR INFERIOR TO THE WORKS OF CHRISTIAN LOVE THIS IS THE HALL-MARK OF ALL FALSE TEACHERS THAT THEY NOT ONLY PERVERT THE PURE DOCTRINE BUT ALSO FAIL IN DOING GOOD
PERSECUTION ALWAYS FOLLOWS ON THE HEELS OF THE WORD OF GOD AS THE PSALMIST EXPERIENCED
ON THE CONTRARY THEY WOULD HAVE PRAISED HIS EVERY ACTION
BUT I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT IS RIGHT
OUR CONVERSATION IS IN HEAVEN NOT LOCALLY IN HEAVEN BUT IN SPIRIT
THIS WAS A BLOW TO THE FALSE APOSTLES
BUT GOD ALONE IS TO BE FEARED AND HONORED
PAUL AND ALL THE OTHER APOSTLES WERE TOLD THE SAME THINGS
AND HOW YOU GALATIANS USED TO TELL ME THAT YOU WERE BLESSED
THE CONSCIENCE OUGHT NOT TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THE LAW
WE PROTEST WE DESIRE NOTHING MORE THAN PEACE WITH ALL MEN
NOW TO ABRAHAM AND HIS SEED WERE THE PROMISES MADE
THE MALADY CALLS FOR A BITTER MEDICINE
I DO NOT SAY THAT IT IS EASY
THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO THE SCRIPTURES BECAUSE THEY ARE BEWITCHED BY THE TRICKY DEVIL WHO CAN MAKE A LIE LOOK LIKE THE TRUTH
IN THE MEANWHILE WE COMFORT OURSELVES WITH THE THOUGHT THAT OUR LABORS ARE NOT LOST UPON THE TRUE BELIEVERS
HOW COME WE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW
THE TRUE GOSPEL DECLARES THAT GOOD WORKS ARE THE EMBELLISHMENT OF FAITH BUT THAT FAITH ITSELF IS THE GIFT AND WORK OF GOD IN OUR HEARTS
TRUE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WORK WELL DONE CANNOT QUIET THE CONSCIENCE
IT IS A MATTER OF BIRTH NOT OF EXERTION
FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER
BLESSED ARE YE SAYS HE WHEN MEN SHALL REVILE YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU AND SHALL SAY ALL MANNER OF EVIL AGAINST YOU FALSELY FOR MY SAKE
IF IT IS TRUE FAITH IT WILL SURELY TAKE CHRIST FOR ITS OBJECT
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO BE IN ERROR--WE WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
THIS HE CONTINUES TO DO IN THE HEARTS OF THE BELIEVERS
EVERY PERIOD OF LIFE HAS ITS OWN PECULIAR TEMPTATIONS
BUT WHEN IT PLEASED GOD WHO SEPARATED ME FROM MY MOTHER'S WOMB AND CALLED ME BY HIS GRACE
THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAW MUST THEREFORE BE STUDIED CAREFULLY LEST WE EITHER REJECT THE LAW ALTOGETHER OR ARE TEMPTED TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE LAW A CAPACITY TO SAVE
PAUL ENDEAVORS TO REFORM THEM OR RATHER REFORM CHRIST IN THEM
HE COVERED HIS FACE WITH A VEIL
CHRIST HIMSELF WAS ACCUSED OF BEING A BLASPHEMER AND REBEL
14:40 THESE DIRECTIONS MAY BE CHANGED OR OMITTED ALTOGETHER AS LONG AS NO OFFENSE IS GIVEN TO THE WEAK
HOW CAN THE LAW AVAIL ANYTHING UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS
IT IS WRITTEN THAT WE ARE SHUT UP UNTO FAITH WHICH SHOULD AFTERWARDS BE REVEALED CHRIST WILL LEAD YOU TO FREEDOM
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE AROUND THE DREG AND DUNG OF THIS BODILY LIFE
IF GOD WERE YOUR FATHER YE WOULD LOVE ME IN OTHER WORDS
THEY LABOR AND BEAR THE BURDEN AND THE HEAT OF THE DAY AND BRING FORTH MANY CHILDREN CHILDREN THAT ARE BASTARDS LIKE THEMSELVES CHILDREN BORN TO BE PUT OUT OF THE HOUSE LIKE ISHMAEL TO PERISH FOREVER
THE LAW BOWS A PERSON DOWN
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME WHEN IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SALVATION OR JUSTIFICATION WITH US WE ARE TO THINK HIGHLY OF THE LAW AND CALL IT HOLY JUST AND GOOD ROMANS 7:12 THE LAW IS OF NO COMFORT TO A STRICKEN CONSCIENCE
MY FLESH SEEMS TO BE ON A WARPATH AGAINST THE SPIRIT AGAIN
IT WAS BAD NEWS FOR PAUL WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE CORINTHIANS WERE DENYING THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD THAT THE CHURCHES HE HAD PLANTED WERE EXPERIENCING ALL KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES AND THAT THE GOSPEL WAS BEING SUPPLANTED BY FALSE DOCTRINES
AND THIS HIS VICTORY HE DONATED UNTO US
THEREFORE TO LIVE UNTO THE LAW IS TO DIE UNTO GOD
WHERE YOU COME ACROSS CONTEMPT FOR THE WORD OF GOD THERE IS THE DEVIL
THEY ALL IMAGINE IF WE DO THIS OR THAT WORK GOD WILL HAVE MERCY ON US
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE ARE UNCERTAIN WHOM TO FOLLOW AND WHICH WAY TO TURN FOR IT IS NOT GIVEN TO EVERYBODY TO JUDGE THESE MATTERS
I SAID UNTO PETER BEFORE THEM ALL IF THOU BEING A JEW LIVEST AFTER THE MANNER OF GENTILES AND NOT AS DO THE JEWS WHY COMPELLEST THOU THE GENTILES TO LIVE AS DO THE JEWS TO LIVE AS A JEW IS NOTHING BAD
PAUL ASKS
AND IF HE WERE STRONGER THAN THE TEACHER HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE BEATINGS BUT BEAT UP THE TEACHER
IF WE BECOME OVERBEARING AND NEGLECT OUR DUTY IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO FALL INTO SIN
HOW CAN A PUPIL LOVE A TEACHER WHO FRUSTRATES HIS DESIRES
CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS NOR FOR EVERY LITTLE CAUSE
BREAK FORTH AND CRY THOU THAT TRAVAILEST NOT
THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
THE LAW FORCES US INTO THE ARMS OF CHRIST WHO IS THE END OF THE LAW FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVETH ROMANS 1:4 CHRIST RELIEVES THE CONSCIENCE OF THE LAW
PAUL IS HERE SPEAKING OF THE REDEEMING CHRIST AND THE BELIEVING ABRAHAM NOT OF THE MODEL CHRIST OR THE SWEATING ABRAHAM
O CURSED SATAN YOU CHOOSE A NICE TIME TO TALK TO ME ABOUT DOING AND WORKING WHEN YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I AM IN TROUBLE OVER MY SINS
THEODORE GRAEBNER ST LOUIS MISSOURI FROM LUTHER'S INTRODUCTION 1538 IN MY HEART REIGNS THIS ONE ARTICLE FAITH IN MY DEAR LORD CHRIST THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF WHATEVER SPIRITUAL AND DIVINE THOUGHTS I MAY HAVE WHETHER BY DAY OR BY NIGHT
IT IS THE OFFICE OF A MEDIATOR TO CONCILIATE THE PARTY THAT IS OFFENDED AND TO PLACATE THE PARTY THAT IS THE OFFENDER
I CANNOT TEACH WRITE PRAY OR GIVE THANKS WITHOUT THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE FLESH
I KNOW THAT A CHRISTIAN SHOULD BE HUMBLE BUT AGAINST THE POPE I AM GOING TO BE PROUD AND SAY TO HIM
AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM TO THEM GAVE HE POWER TO BECOME THE SONS OF GOD EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIS NAME JOHN 1:12 WHAT TONGUE OF MAN OR ANGEL CAN ADEQUATELY EXTOL THE MERCY OF GOD TOWARD US MISERABLE SINNERS IN THAT HE ADOPTED US FOR HIS OWN CHILDREN AND FELLOW-HEIRS WITH HIS SON BY THE SIMPLE MEANS OF FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
CHAPTER 5 IN THIS CHAPTER THE APOSTLE PAUL PRESENTS THE DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY IN A FINAL EFFORT TO PERSUADE THE GALATIANS TO GIVE UP THE NEFARIOUS DOCTRINE OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
CHRIST AND HIS BENEFITS WOULD BE LOST TO US
THIS IS A GOOD POINT IN PAUL'S REFUTATION
SIN HAS ITS UNRESTRICTED WAY WITH THEM
WE REFUSE TO HAVE OUR CONSCIENCE BOUND BY ANY WORK OR LAW SO THAT BY DOING THIS OR THAT WE SHOULD BE RIGHTEOUS OR LEAVING THIS OR THAT UNDONE WE SHOULD BE DAMNED
FROM HENCEFORTH LET NO MAN TROUBLE ME
WHEN EVERYTHING RUNS ALONG SMOOTHLY THE HEBREWS SPOKE OF IT AS A RACE
THEY BURN NO SACRIFICES
WHAT LIBERTY DOES PAUL MEAN
THE CHURCH THEY SAY CHOSE ONLY FOUR GOSPELS
THE SECOND FAULT IS THAT IT OBLIGATES THOSE WHO ARE CIRCUMCISED TO OBSERVE THE WHOLE LAW
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU CALL IT BUT SPITTING IN CHRIST'S FACE PUSHING CHRIST TO THE SIDE USURPING CHRIST'S THRONE AND TO SAY
HE CURTAILS THEIR INCOME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY ARE FORCED OUT OF THE MINISTRY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LIVE BY THE GOSPEL
THIS IS THE TRUE CHRIST AND THERE IS NONE OTHER
MANY OF THESE SPECIALISTS HAVE INCAPACITATED THEMSELVES FOR ANY KIND OF WORK GOOD OR BAD BY THEIR RIGOROUS ATTENTION TO RULES AND LAWS
NOW ARISES ANOTHER QUESTION
SECONDARILY PROPHETS
MY CALL IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE FOR IT IS BY JESUS CHRIST AND GOD THE FATHER WHEN PAUL SPEAKS OF THOSE CALLED BY MEN I TAKE IT HE MEANS THOSE WHOM NEITHER GOD NOR MAN SENT BUT WHO GO WHEREVER THEY LIKE AND SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
HE IS READY TO BELIEVE ALL MEN BUT HE WILL NOT TRUST ALL MEN
AND THAT BECAUSE OF FALSE BRETHREN UNAWARES BROUGHT IN WHO CAME IN PRIVILY TO SPY OUT OUR LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS THAT THEY MIGHT BRING US INTO BONDAGE
THE SCRIPTURES SAYS PAUL MEANT TO FORESTALL YOUR INFATUATION FOR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW BY INSTALLING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH BEFORE CIRCUMCISION AND THE LAW EVER WERE ORDAINED VERSE 8
HE IS A TRUE THEOLOGIAN
DID NOT PAUL PREACH TO THE JEWS WHILE PETER PREACHED TO THE GENTILES ALSO
BUT IF THE LAW PRESUMES TO USURP THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE GOSPEL IT IS NO LONGER THE HOLY LAW OF GOD BUT A PSEUDO-GOSPEL
I AM GUILTY OF ETERNAL DEATH
IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER HE MENTIONS SORCERY AMONG THE WORKS OF THE FLESH DECLARING THAT WITCHCRAFT AND SORCERY ARE REAL MANIFESTATIONS AND LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES OF THE DEVIL
DOCTRINE IS A PIECE OF HEAVEN LIFE IS A PIECE OF EARTH
WATCH AND WRESTLE IN SPIRIT AGAINST YOUR WEAKNESS
NEVERTHELESS YOU SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT I.E FIGHT AGAINST THE FLESH AND FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE HOLY GHOST
ALAS HE CRIES HAVE YOU COME TO THIS THAT YOU NO LONGER KNOW GOD
10:4 AND CHRIST HIMSELF DECLARED
THE CURSE HAD TO GIVE WAY
HE TELLS THEM I DID NOT SPEAK EVIL OF PETER BEHIND HIS BACK BUT I WITHSTOOD HIM FRANKLY AND OPENLY OTHERS MAY DEBATE HERE WHETHER AN APOSTLE MIGHT SIN
THE CHURCH MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE
I WENT TO ARABIA BEFORE I SAW ANY OF THE APOSTLES
BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW SHALL NO FLESH BE JUSTIFIED VERSE 17
NOT EVERYBODY CAN RESIST TEMPTATIONS WITH EQUAL FACILITY
THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY GOD WITH ALL THY HEART IT WOULD DO YOU NO GOOD
BUT NOW THAT RELIGION HAS BEEN REFORMED MANY WHO FORMERLY WERE SUCH EARNEST DISCIPLES HAVE DISCARDED THE WORD OF GOD HAVE BECOME SOW-BELLIES LIKE THE FOOLISH AND INCONSISTENT GALATIANS
WHY THE LAW MAKES TROUBLE EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT
IT DARE NO LONGER BANISH US FROM GOD
HE IS ASTOUNDINGLY CLEVER TO SELL HIS PATENT POISON FOR THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST
IF WE HAVE SOWN UNTO YOU SPIRITUAL THINGS IS IT A GREAT THING IF WE SHALL REAP YOUR CARNAL THINGS I COR
TO REVEAL HIS SON IN ME THAT I MIGHT PREACH HIM AMONG THE HEATHEN
IN FACT THE SERVANTS OF THE LAW ARE EVEN NOW BARRED FROM THE KINGDOM OF LIGHT AND LIBERTY FOR HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT IS CONDEMNED ALREADY JOHN 3:18 AS THE SERVANTS OF THE LAW THEY REMAIN UNDER THE CURSE OF THE LAW UNDER SIN AND DEATH UNDER THE POWER OF THE DEVIL AND UNDER THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD
BUT THE MOMENT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST TOUCHES THEM CERTAINTY COMES TO THEM AND JOY AND A RIGHT JUDGMENT
AND THE LORD HAD RESPECT UNTO ABEL AND TO HIS OFFERING AHA THEY CRY
IN THE MIDST OF MY FRENZY I WAS CALLED
OUR OPPONENTS DO US A GREAT WRONG FOR WE MAKE A CLEAR-CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN CIVIL AND SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS
TRUE FAITH LAYS HOLD OF CHRIST AND LEANS ON HIM ALONE
IF I SHOULD DO SO I WOULD NOT ONLY BE LABORING IN VAIN BUT I WOULD MAKE MYSELF GUILTY OF A GREAT WRONG
AGAINST MY DEATH I SET ANOTHER DEATH OR RATHER LIFE MY LIFE IN CHRIST
THE LAW DOES NOT CONCERN HIM
FOR IN JESUS CHRIST NEITHER CIRCUMCISION AVAILETH ANY THING NOR UNCIRCUMCISION BUT FAITH WHICH WORKETH BY LOVE
THE ACTIVITIES OF A CHRISTIAN ARE NOT SENSATIONAL
HE ENDS HIS EPISTLE AS HE BEGAN IT BY WISHING THE GALATIANS THE GRACE OF GOD
THE LAW IS WEAK AND POOR THE SINNER IS WEAK AND POOR--TWO FEEBLE BEGGARS TRYING TO HELP EACH OTHER
LOVE ACCORDING TO PAUL BELIEVETH ALL THINGS HOPETH ALL THINGS ENDURETH ALL THINGS THIS COMMANDMENT IS NOT MEANT FOR THOSE WHO DENY CHRIST
SO ZEALOUS WAS I IN DEFENSE OF THE LAW THAT I WASTED THE CHURCH OF GOD VERSE 14
SIN LINGERS IN US AND GOD HATES SIN
AND THE DEVIL SAYS AMEN WE MUST LEARN THAT FORGIVENESS OF SINS CHRIST AND THE HOLY GHOST ARE FREELY GRANTED UNTO US AT THE PREACHING OF FAITH IN SPITE OF OUR SINFULNESS
THE WORLD REGARDS TRUE CHRISTIANS AS THE WORST OFFENDERS FOR WHOM NO PUNISHMENT CAN BE TOO SEVERE
BUT GOD GAVE IT TO ABRAHAM BY PROMISE
THE WORLD THINKS US MAD BECAUSE WE GO ABOUT TO COMFORT TO HELP TO SAVE OTHERS WHILE WE OURSELVES ARE IN DISTRESS
A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENETH THE WHOLE LUMP OUR OPPONENTS RECORD THE SAME COMPLAINTS ABOUT US
THE DISCIPLINE IS TO LAST UNTIL THE BOY HAS BEEN TRAINED TO BE HIS FATHER'S WORTHY SUCCESSOR
WHEN A PERSON ON BOARD SHIP FALLS INTO THE SEA AND IS DROWNED IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE FROM WHICH END OR SIDE OF THE SHIP HE FALLS INTO THE WATER
PAUL HIMSELF TAUGHT AND EXEMPLIFIED SUCH THOUGHTFULNESS
THE FALSE APOSTLES PERSUADED THE GALATIANS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE IN ERROR AND THAT THEY HAD MADE LITTLE OR NO PROGRESS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PAUL
TO REALIZE THAT ONE IS ILL IS A STEP AND A VERY NECESSARY STEP TOWARD RECOVERY
BUT WHEN THE FULLNESS OF THE TIME WAS COME GOD SENT FORTH HIS SON MADE OF A WOMAN MADE UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW
THEY WILL OBSERVE HUMAN LAWS PUNCTILIOUSLY BUT THE LAWS OF GOD THEY TRANSGRESS WITHOUT THE FLICKER OF AN EYELID
TO SAY THAT CHRIST DIED IN VAIN IS TO MAKE HIS RESURRECTION HIS VICTORY HIS GLORY HIS KINGDOM HEAVEN EARTH GOD HIMSELF OF NO PURPOSE AND BENEFIT WHATEVER
SO CAREFULLY DID I LIVE UP TO THE LAW THAT I EXCELLED MANY OF MY COMPANIONS
FOR IF THE INHERITANCE BE OF THE LAW IT IS NO MORE OF PROMISE
DEATH IS EMPEROR OF THE WORLD
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO CHANGE EVEN A TITTLE OF IT
IF YOU DO NOT CARE FOR IT VERY WELL
IN CALLING THE LAW THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD PAUL REFERS TO THE WHOLE LAW PRINCIPALLY TO THE CEREMONIAL LAW WHICH DEALT WITH EXTERNAL MATTERS AS MEAT DRINK DRESS PLACES TIMES FEASTS CLEANSINGS SACRIFICES ETC
I PICTURED HIM AS LIVING IN THE WILDERNESS ABSTAINING FROM MEAT AND DRINK AND LIVING ON ROOTS AND HERBS AND COLD WATER
IF WE CANNOT DENY THAT WE ARE SINNERS WE CANNOT DENY THAT CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS
NOW WE ARE DEALING WITH JUSTIFICATION AND HERE GOOD WORKS SHOULD NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
PAUL WHO STANDS ALONE A MERE DISCIPLE OF THE APOSTLES ONE OF THE LAST AND LEAST
FIRST AS A GIFT
EVERYONE WHO SEEKS RIGHTEOUSNESS WITHOUT CHRIST EITHER BY WORKS MERITS SATISFACTIONS ACTIONS OR BY THE LAW REJECTS THE GRACE OF GOD AND DESPISES THE DEATH OF CHRIST
THE ONE THING HE REQUIRES OF YOU IS THAT YOU BELIEVE IN CHRIST WHOM HE HATH SENT
AND SUCH IT SHOULD BE
HE IS SO WORKED UP THAT HE DARES TO CURSE ALL WHO PERVERT HIS GOSPEL
PEOPLE FOOLISH BUT WISE IN THEIR CONCEITS JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION
CHRIST IS LORD OVER LAW SIN AND DEATH
WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED ROM
OF THIS OPPOSITION THE APOSTLE WRITES IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
THOSE WHO ARE GIVEN TO EXCESS ARE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT SPIRITUAL BUT CARNAL
AS UNYIELDING AS THE HOLY SPIRIT IS IN THE MATTER OF MAINTAINING AND DEFENDING THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH SO MILD AND MERCIFUL IS HE TOWARD MEN FOR THEIR SINS AS LONG AS SINNERS REPENT
NO DOUBT MANY OF THE GALATIANS WERE TAKEN BACK WITH THE VEHEMENCY OF THE APOSTLE
WHY THEN DO YOU SAY THAT WE ARE PERVERTED THAT WE HAVE FORSAKEN THE TRUE DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE FOOLISH BEWITCHED ETC IF YOU ARE NOT ANGRY
HE TAKES THE FULL BLAST OF THE WRATH OF THE LAW AND FULFILLS ITS DEMANDS MOST METICULOUSLY
HOW CAN YE BELIEVE WHICH RECEIVE HONOR ONE OF ANOTHER AND SEEK NOT THE HONOR THAT COMETH FROM GOD ALONE VERSE 10
WHY SHOULD ONE MONK WANT TO BE ACCOUNTED MORE HOLY THAN ANOTHER MONK BECAUSE OF SOME SILLY CEREMONY WHEN ALL THE TIME THEIR BASIC BELIEFS ARE ASNMUCH ALIKE AS ONE EGG IS LIKE THE OTHER
THRICE WAS I BEATEN WITH RODS ONCE WAS I STONED THRICE I SUFFERED SHIPWRECK ETC
THERE IS MUCH IMPARITY AMONG MEN IN THE WORLD
THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO THAT
EVEN NOW ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUALLY EXPLAIN THE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL WE HAVE THOSE AMONG US WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAW SHOULD BE USED
AS TOUCHING THE LAW A PHARISEE
IF OUR ADMONITIONS BEAR NO FRUIT WE LEAVE THEM TO GOD WHO WILL IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME TAKE CARE OF THESE DISRESPECTERS OF HIS GOODNESS
NOW I SAY THAT THE HEIR AS LONG AS HE IS A CHILD DIFFERETH NOTHING FROM A SERVANT THOUGH HE BE LORD OF ALL
GOD IS QUICK TO CATCH THE SIGH OF THE HEART
WITH WHAT RESULTS THEY SHALL PRESENTLY FIND OUT
HOW COULD YOU SO SOON FORSAKE THE LIGHT AND RETURN TO DARKNESS
CHRISTIANS ALSO FALL AND PERFORM THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH
AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY REPROVES THEM FOR PERMITTING THEMSELVES TO BE REMOVED
WHEN THE POISON OF VAINGLORY GETS INTO THE CHURCH YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAVOC IT CAN CAUSE
CHRISTIAN CHARITY AND UNITY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WORD OF GOD
I COUNTED IT A SIN EVEN TO THINK OF HIM
I NEVER HE SAYS WROTE SUCH A LONG LETTER WITH MY OWN HAND TO ANY OF THE OTHER CHURCHES HIS OTHER EPISTLES HE DICTATED AND ONLY SUBSCRIBED HIS GREETINGS AND HIS SIGNATURE WITH HIS OWN HAND
IN BRANDING THE WORLD THE DEVIL'S KINGDOM OF INIQUITY IGNORANCE ERROR SIN DEATH AND EVERLASTING DESPAIR PAUL AT THE SAME TIME DECLARES THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST TO BE A KINGDOM OF EQUITY LIGHT GRACE REMISSION OF SIN PEACE SAVING HEALTH AND EVERLASTING LIFE INTO WHICH WE ARE TRANSLATED BY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST TO WHOM BE GLORY FOREVER
IMPERFECTIONS ARE BOUND TO SHOW UP
WHATEVER I DID I DID WITH A SINGLE HEART TO THE GLORY OF GOD
IF ANY MAN BRINGS ANY OTHER GOSPEL THAN THE ONE I BROUGHT YOU OR PROMISES TO DELIVER BETTER THINGS THAN YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM ME LET HIM BE ACCURSED IN SPITE OF THIS EMPHATIC DENUNCIATION SO MANY ACCEPT THE POPE AS THE SUPREME JUDGE OF THE SCRIPTURES
WE WOULD BE FAR MORE HUMBLE AND PATIENT AND KIND
PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HARD WITH YOU
CHRIST FOREWARNED THE FAITHFUL AGAINST THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS SAYING
IF HE SAW THAT THEY WERE REPENTANT HE COULD SOFTEN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
THE FALSE APOSTLES MADE THE SAME CLAIM FOR THEIR GOSPEL
I AM STILL OF THE SAME OPINION
BUT CHRIST TOOK ALL OUR SINS AND DIED FOR THEM ON THE CROSS
YE ARE FALLEN FROM GRACE
YE ARE FALLEN FROM GRACE
5:11 12 BY THE CROSS OF CHRIST IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD HERE THE TWO PIECES OF WOOD TO WHICH HE WAS NAILED BUT ALL THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE BELIEVERS WHOSE SUFFERINGS ARE CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS
LEST BY ANY MEANS I SHOULD RUN OR HAD RUN IN VAIN
MY SIGHT IS NO LONGER GOVERNED BY THE FLESH BUT BY THE HOLY GHOST
WHY WORRY ABOUT OUR LACK OF WORTHINESS
PAUL'S ZEAL FOR THE GOSPEL BECOMES SO FERVENT THAT IT ALMOST LEADS HIM TO CURSE ANGELS
FOR BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW SHALL NO FLESH BE JUSTIFIED
IT IS NOT EASY
LET THE LAW NOW DEPART AND LET THE GOSPEL ENTER FOR NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO HEAR THE GOSPEL AND NOT THE LAW HOWEVER WHEN THE CONFLICT OF CONSCIENCE IS OVER AND EXTERNAL DUTIES MUST BE PERFORMED CLOSE YOUR EARS TO THE GOSPEL AND OPEN THEM WIDE TO THE LAW
BUT THESE FALSE APOSTLES ARE GIVING YOU A NEW FORM THE FORM OF MOSES NOTE THE APOSTLE DOES NOT SAY OF WHOM I TRAVAIL IN BIRTH AGAIN UNTIL I BE FORMED IN YOU BUT UNTIL CHRIST BE FORMED IN YOU THE FALSE APOSTLES HAD TORN THE FORM OF CHRIST OUT OF THE HEARTS OF THE GALATIANS AND SUBSTITUTED THEIR OWN FORM
OBEY THE SPIRIT AND FIGHT AGAINST THE FLESH VERSE 16
THE LAW DOES NOT BRING ON THE HOLY GHOST
WE SAY THE LAW IS GOOD IF IT IS USED FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS DESIGNED TO CHECK CIVIL TRANSGRESSION AND TO MAGNIFY SPIRITUAL TRANSGRESSIONS
AND WHEN JAMES CEPHAS AND JOHN WHO SEEMED TO BE PILLARS PERCEIVED THE GRACE THAT WAS GIVEN UNTO ME THEY GAVE TO ME AND BARNABAS THE RIGHT HANDS OF FELLOWSHIP
THEY BOASTED
THIS IS NOT TO DO THE LAW
IF WE COULD HAVE PERFECT FAITH OUR LOATHING FOR THIS LIFE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE COMPLETE
INSTEAD OF FAVOR WE FOUND FURY
THE WORD OF GOD IS TAUGHT AS IT SHOULD BE THE SACRAMENTS ARE ADMINISTERED AND EVERYTHING IS PROSPEROUS
YOU BELONG IN HEAVEN BY HIS COMPROMISING ATTITUDE PETER CONFUSED THE SEPARATION OF LAW AND GOSPEL
FAITH TEACHES DESCRIBES DIRECTS
HE NEVER GAVE THE LAW ANY THOUGHT
AS IF THE APOSTLES HAD SAID TO HIM
BUT UNTO THEM WHICH ARE CALLED BOTH JEWS AND GREEKS CHRIST THE POWER OF GOD AND THE WISDOM OF GOD BEGIN WITH CHRIST
THE FALSE APOSTLES TAUGHT THAT IN ADDITION TO FAITH IN CHRIST THE WORKS OF THE LAW OF GOD WERE NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION
AND IF THE PUPIL DISOBEYS THE SCHOOLMASTER WHIPS HIM AND THE PUPIL HAS TO LIKE IT AND EVEN KISS THE ROD WITH WHICH HE WAS BEATEN
7:15 PAUL WAS CONSIDERABLY DISTURBED BY THE COMMISSIONS AND CHANGES THAT FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF HIS PREACHING
WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME OUT OF EGYPT A FEELING OF SINGULAR HOLINESS POSSESSED THEM
WITHOUT CHRIST WISDOM IS DOUBLE FOOLISHNESS AND INTEGRITY DOUBLE SIN BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY FAIL TO PERCEIVE THE WISDOM AND RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST BUT HINDER AND BLASPHEME THE SALVATION OF CHRIST
HE TREMBLED SO HE COULD HARDLY TALK
WHEN THAT DRAGON ACCUSES US OF HAVING DONE NO GOOD AT ALL BUT ONLY EVIL SAY TO HIM
AND PAUL ADDS THESE CHURCHES GLORIFIED GOD IN ME NOT BECAUSE I TAUGHT THAT CIRCUMCISION AND THE LAW OF MOSES SHOULD BE OBSERVED BUT BECAUSE I URGED UPON ALL FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CHAPTER 2 VERSE 1
MARTHA MARTHA JESUS SAID THOU ART CAREFUL AND TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS
THE NIGHT COMETH WHEN NO MAN CAN WORK JOHN 9:4 OUR GOOD DEEDS ARE TO BE DIRECTED PRIMARILY AT THOSE WHO SHARE THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WITH US THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH AS PAUL CALLS THEM AMONG WHOM THE MINISTERS RANK FIRST AS OBJECTS OF OUR WELL DOING
THE WORLD HATES THE CHRISTIANS WITH AMAZING BRUTALITY AND WITHOUT COMPUNCTION COMMITS THEM TO THE MOST SHAMEFUL DEATH CONGRATULATING ITSELF THAT IT HAS RENDERED GOD AND THE CAUSE OF PEACE A DISTINCT SERVICE BY RIDDING THE WORLD OF THE UNDESIRED PRESENCE OF THESE CHRISTIANS
WE ARE NOT TO LOOK UPON OUR SINS AS INSIGNIFICANT TRIFLES
I DO NOT CONDEMN THE LAW IN ITSELF
SEEING THEY CRUCIFY TO THEMSELVES THE SON OF GOD AFRESH AND PUT HIM TO AN OPEN SHAME IT SHOULD MAKE ANY PERSON AFRAID TO HEAR PAUL SAY THAT THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW NOT ONLY DENY CHRIST BUT ALSO CRUCIFY HIM ANEW
THE LAW CAN NO LONGER ACCUSE OR CONDEMN THEM
TRUE BELIEVERS ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW
YOU YOUNGER MEN ARE A GOOD DEAL BETTER OFF THAN WE WHO ARE OLD
OR HAVE YOU OBTAINED YOUR FREEDOM FROM US WHO PREACH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
FIRST THEY ARE GREEDY OF PRAISE
WHAT DO WE GAIN
LET HIM NOT SEEK HIS OWN GLORY OR LOOK FOR PRAISE
THE CONSCIENCE OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY CHRIST
IT WOULD HAVE RUN TO MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED PAGES ORDINARY OCTAVO LIKE THIS SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE COMPRESSED STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF LATIN AND PARTICULARLY OF LUTHER'S LATIN
THEY INSISTED THAT THE LAW MUST BE OBSERVED IN EVERY DETAIL
THIS HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY DEPLORED EVEN BY SOME OF THE ANCIENT FATHERS WHO FELT THAT PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN VIRGIN INSTEAD OF WOMAN
THE LORD THY GOD WILL RAISE UP UNTO THEE A PROPHET FROM THE MIDST OF THEE OF THY BRETHREN LIKE UNTO ME
BY RIGHTS ISHMAEL SHOULD HAVE ENJOYED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE FIRSTBORN IF PHYSICAL GENERATION HAD ANY SPECIAL VALUE
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY TEACH THESE THREE COUNTS AGAINST THE FALSE APOSTLES ARE OF SO SERIOUS A NATURE THAT NO CHRISTIAN COULD HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM
LET THE LAW SIN AND THE DEVIL CRY OUT AGAINST US UNTIL THEIR OUTCRY FILLS HEAVEN AND EARTH
GOD DOES NOT OFFEND ANYBODY THEREFORE HE NEEDS NO MEDIATOR
THE HOLY GHOST IMPREGNATES THE WORD SO THAT IT BRINGS FORTH THE FRUIT OF FAITH
YOU HAVE LOST YOUR INFLUENCE FOREVER THE WORDS CHRIST WAS MADE UNDER THE LAW ARE WORTH ALL THE ATTENTION WE CAN BESTOW ON THEM
THE WORKING ABRAHAM OUGHT TO LOOK PRETTY SMALL NEXT TO THE BELIEVING ABRAHAM
WHAT KIND OF LIFE WOULD OURS BE IF NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
THAT HE HAS A VIRGIN IN MIND IS OBVIOUS
THIS HEAVENLY JERUSALEM IS THE CHURCH THAT IS TO SAY THE NUMBER OF ALL BELIEVERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVING ONE AND THE SAME GOSPEL ONE AND THE SAME FAITH IN CHRIST ONE AND THE SAME HOLY GHOST AND THE SAME SACRAMENTS
TOUCHING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS IN THE LAW BLAMELESS HE MEANS TO SAY I CAN COMPARE MYSELF WITH THE BEST AND HOLIEST OF ALL THOSE WHO ARE OF THE CIRCUMCISION
IF PAUL HAD NOT PUBLICLY CENSURED HIM ALL THE BELIEVING GENTILES WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO RECEIVE CIRCUMCISION AND ACCEPT THE JEWISH LAW
IT PLEASED GOD SAYS THE APOSTLE TO REVEAL HIMSELF IN ME
HE PARAPHRASES THE WORDS OF CHRIST
CHRIST IS RISEN FROM DEATH
NOT BECAUSE HE WAS CIRCUMCISED
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY REJECTED THE GRACE OF GOD YOU HAVE SHAMEFULLY CRUCIFIED CHRIST AMONG YOU PAUL EMPLOYS THE SAME PHRASEOLOGY IN HEBREWS 6:6
IT SEEMS THAT SUCH A HORRIBLE WICKEDNESS COULD NOT ENTER A MAN'S HEART THAT HE SHOULD REJECT THE GRACE OF GOD AND DESPISE THE DEATH OF CHRIST
WHEN WE TEACH JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IN CHRIST WE CONFESS AT THE SAME TIME THAT CHRIST IS GOD
IF A MINISTER PREACHES ON MONEY HE IS LIKELY TO BE ACCUSED OF COVETOUSNESS
BESIDES THE PASSAGE FROM SOLOMON DOES NOT TREAT OF THE HATRED AND LOVE OF GOD TOWARDS MEN
THIS IS THE APOSTLE'S FAREWELL
IN ONE MORE RESPECT THE LAW HAS BEEN ABOLISHED
WHAT PROMPTED HIM TO CALL ME
YOU KNOW THAT THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW IS NOT NEEDED UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS
AS IF HE WERE SAYING
IT WAS ADDED BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSIONS
IT WAS ADDED BECAUSE OF TRANSGRESSIONS
THE WORLD DWELLS IN DARKNESS
SECONDLY THE SCRIPTURES PRESENT CHRIST FOR OUR EXAMPLE
WHY NOT
THEREFORE AS LONG AS THE GOSPEL HOLDS SWAY PERSECUTION PLAYS THE ACCOMPANIMENT OR ELSE THERE IS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH THE DEVIL
LET EVERYBODY BECOME SURE OF HIS CALLING AND DOCTRINE THAT HE MAY BOLDLY SAY WITH PAUL
THE MARKS ON MY BODY INDICATE WHOSE SERVANT I AM
NEVERTHELESS WE MAY ALWAYS TAKE RECOURSE TO THIS FACT THAT OUR SINS ARE COVERED AND THAT GOD WILL NOT LAY THEM TO OUR CHARGE SIN IS NOT HELD AGAINST US FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
THEY HAVE CONTRARY FUNCTIONS AND PURPOSES
WHEN SIN RAGES IN OUR BODY AND WE THROUGH THE SPIRIT WRESTLE AGAINST IT THEN WE HAVE CAUSE FOR HOPE
9:11 IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE POPE REIGNED SUPREME EVERYBODY PAID PLENTY FOR MASSES
HIS MOTIVES WERE PERVERSE THEREFORE HIS WORKS WERE HYPOCRITICAL AND NO GOOD WELL WELL
THE LAW IS NOT TO TEACH US ANOTHER LAW
I THOUGHT THEN THAT PAUL'S ADMONITIONS WERE OVERDONE
CAN THERE BE ANYTHING MORE HORRIBLE THAN THE PAPACY AN ALLIANCE OF PEOPLE WHO CRUCIFY CHRIST IN THEMSELVES IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE HEARTS OF THE BELIEVERS
NOT FOR ALWAYS BUT UNTIL WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO CHRIST
TO TOLERATE A TRIFLING ERROR INEVITABLY LEADS TO CRASS HERESY
OR IT MAY BE CONSTRUED TO READ
YOU ARE NOW PETER THE LIAR
IT OVERWHELMED HIM WITH SUCH ANGUISH OF SOUL THAT HIS SWEAT WAS AS BLOOD
MY PUNISHMENT IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR HE COULD ONLY THINK OF THE PRISON
AND WHEN PEOPLE PRAISE YOU THEY REALLY MEAN TO PRAISE GOD IN YOU
REJOICE THOU BARREN AS CHRIST IS GREATER THAN THE LAW SO MUCH MORE EXCELLENT IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST THAN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW
HE OBEYS THE LAW WITHOUT COMPULSION
YOU REMIND ME THAT I HAVE DONE NO GOOD
NOBODY PRAISES US
OF THIS TERROR OF THE LAW THE PSALMS FURNISH MANY GLIMPSES
I TRIED HARD TO LIVE UP TO EVERY LAW AS BEST I COULD
IF THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW AND ITS WORKS ARE CRUCIFIERS OF CHRIST WHAT ARE THEY I LIKE TO KNOW WHO SEEK SALVATION BY THE FILTHY RAGS OF THEIR OWN WORK-RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHEN IT COME TO THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION WE MUST NOT YIELD IF WE WANT TO RETAIN THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
2:22 HENCE THE LAW HAD NO JURISDICTION OVER HIM
HE THAT LOVETH FATHER OR MOTHER OR HIS OWN LIFE MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME MATT
JEROME AND HIS PRESENT-DAY FOLLOWERS RACK THEIR MISERABLE BRAINS OVER THIS COMFORTING PASSAGE IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE CHRIST FROM THE FANCIED INSULT OF BEING CALLED A CURSE
BY FAITH WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY HOPE WE ENDURE TO THE END
THE APOSTLES COULD ONLY DISTRIBUTE THESE BLESSINGS BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
I HAVE TRANSGRESSED ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD
BY MASSES PILGRIMAGES PARDONS MERITS ETC
TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT PORK WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
THE LAW HAS A PROMISE BUT IT IS A CONDITIONAL PROMISE DEPENDING UPON WHETHER PEOPLE FULFILL THE LAW
IF WE SURRENDER FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE ONLY THING THAT CAN JUSTIFY US THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS ARE WITHOUT MEANING
HE INVITES THEM
UNTO THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA
THE APOSTLE DECLARES THAT WE ARE FREE FROM THE LAW
ONE PURPOSE IS CIVIL
IF THE JEWS WANT TO KEEP THE LAW AND BE CIRCUMCISED VERY WELL AS LONG AS THEY DO SO FROM A RIGHT MOTIVE VERSE 2
LET US PRACTICE THIS BLESSED CONVICTION
HE FEARS THE GALATIANS HAVE LOST GOD ALTOGETHER
THE APOSTLE MUST HAVE BEEN FACED BY THIS VERY SITUATION OTHERWISE HIS VEHEMENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCALLED FOR
WHEN THEY ARE UP YOU COME AGAIN
WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE THE WILL OF THE FATHER IN CHRIST THEN SHALL WE KNOW GOD TO BE MERCIFUL AND NOT ANGRY
IT IS WRITTEN
IT IS WRITTEN
IN FACT YOU CANNOT DO IT BECAUSE OF YOUR FLESH
IF YOU ARE A SINNER YOU STAND NO CHANCE
UNITY WITH THEM WOULD BE AN UNMISTAKABLE SIGN THAT WE HAVE LOST THE TRUE DOCTRINE
NOT SO
NO OTHER BEING CAN POSSIBLY DELIVER US FROM THIS PRESENT EVIL WORLD
HE REPEATS HIS ADMONITION IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE THE VICIOUSNESS OF PRIDE THAT HAD CAUSED ALL THE TROUBLE IN THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA AND HAS ALWAYS CAUSED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST NO END OF DIFFICULTIES
THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW GROW WEAKER AND MORE DESTITUTE RIGHT ALONG
IN ORDER THAT THE PROMISE OF GOD SHOULD NOT BE ANNULLED BY HER BARRENNESS THIS HOLY WOMAN RESIGNED HER RIGHT AND HONOR TO HER MAID
WHEN OTHERS HEAR ABOUT THIS CHRISTIAN LIBERTY OF OURS THEY AT ONCE INFER IF I AM FREE I MAY DO WHAT I LIKE
PAUL NOW BEGINS TO WARN THE GALATIANS AGAINST A TWOFOLD DANGER
TO THIS THE SCRIPTURES AND THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL TIMES BEAR WITNESS
BUT WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM
YOU ARE NOT FIT TO BE HEIRS
THE PROPER OFFICE OF CHRIST IS TO RAISE THE SINNER AND EXTRICATE HIM FROM HIS SINS
THE JEWS BELIEVED THAT BY THE RESTRAINT AND DISCIPLINE OF THE LAW THE PROMISES OF GOD WOULD BE HASTENED IN FACT EARNED BY THEM
BEHOLD I PAUL HE SAYS I WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE GOSPEL NOT FROM MEN BUT BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST
ACTS 17:6 7 OF PAUL THEY SAID
BUT HE INSISTED AND THE CONFERENCE UPHELD HIM THAT CIRCUMCISION HAD NO BEARING UPON SALVATION AND WAS THEREFORE NOT TO BE FORCED UPON THE GENTILES
SOME WILL OBJECT THAT THE LAW IS DIVINE AND HOLY
1:24 IT IS GOOD FOR US TO KNOW THIS LEST WE SINK INTO DESPAIR WHEN OUR OPPONENTS PERSECUTE US
FOR HE THAT WROUGHT EFFECTUALLY IN PETER TO THE APOSTLESHIP OF THE CIRCUMCISION THE SAME WAS MIGHTY IN ME TOWARD THE GENTILES HERE THE APOSTLE CLAIMS FOR HIMSELF THE SAME AUTHORITY WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES ATTRIBUTED TO THE TRUE APOSTLES
THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM IS NOT SARAH BUT A PART OF HAGAR
WHAT IS THIS BRUISING AND BEATING BY THE HAND OF THE LAW TO ACCOMPLISH
THE LAW WAS ADDED FOR THESE REASONS
THAT BETTER MEDIATOR IS JESUS CHRIST
FOR BARNABAS AND OTHER JEWS FOLLOWED PETER'S EXAMPLE
OH THE SWEET NAMES OF JESUS
AS LONG AS WE CLING TO HIM WITH A STEADFAST FAITH WE POSSESS HIS PRICELESS GIFTS
SECTS UNDER SECTS PAUL HERE UNDERSTANDS HERESIES
SO MUCH IS CERTAIN WE PERSECUTE NO MAN NEITHER DOES OUR DOCTRINE TROUBLE MEN
BUT IN AFFLICTION PARTICULARLY IN THE HOUR OF DEATH THE GRACE AND PEACE OF THE WORLD WILL NOT DELIVER US
PAUL STILL HAS FOR HIS TEXT GENESIS 22:18 IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED IN THE COURSE OF HIS EPISTLE HE CALLS THIS PROMISE OF THE BLESSING RIGHTEOUSNESS LIFE DELIVERANCE FROM THE LAW THE TESTAMENT ETC
THESE SAYS PETER USE THEIR LIBERTY FOR A CLOAK OF MALICIOUSNESS AND BRING THE NAME AND THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST INTO ILL REPUTE
REJOICE GREATLY O DAUGHTER OF ZION
THE FALSE APOSTLES KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE CROSS AND THE DEADLY HATRED OF THE JEWISH NATION
OUR OPPONENTS TEACH IF YOU WANT TO LIVE UNTO GOD YOU MUST LIVE AFTER THE LAW FOR IT IS WRITTEN DO THIS AND THOU SHALT LIVE PAUL ON THE OTHER HAND TEACHES WE CANNOT LIVE UNTO GOD UNLESS WE ARE DEAD UNTO THE LAW IF WE ARE DEAD UNTO THE LAW THE LAW CAN HAVE NO POWER OVER US
OF ABEL IT IS SAID IN THE SAME EPISTLE
WE CAN IMAGINE THE APOSTLE SAYING TO THE GALATIANS
THE ALLEGORY WHICH PAUL IS ABOUT TO BRING IS TAKEN FROM THE BOOK OF GENESIS WHICH HE CALLS THE LAW
AT ONE TIME YOU GALATIANS DID NOT KNOW GOD
THESE VIRTUES ARE COMMENDABLE OF COURSE
THE CONTROVERSY INVOLVED THE PRESERVATION OF PURE DOCTRINE
I WRETCHED AND DAMNABLE SINNER DEARLY BELOVED OF THE SON OF GOD
20:19 I ASK YOU WHAT GOOD DID THEIR SCRUBBING THEIR SNOW-WHITE CLOTHES AND THEIR CONTINENCE DO THEM
SUCH FAITH IS NOT SUSPICIOUS OF PEOPLE BUT BELIEVES THE BEST
YOUR JOINING THIS HOLY ORDER HAS BEEN IN VAIN AND ALL YOUR GOOD WORKS ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING IF AT THAT TIME I HAD UNDERSTOOD THIS PASSAGE THE FLESH LUSTETH AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH I COULD HAVE SPARED MYSELF MANY A DAY OF SELF-TORMENT
BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR YOUR SINS
WE DO NOT OFFHAND CONDEMN THE LAW BECAUSE WE SAY IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY
BE NOT DECEIVED
I SAVE MYSELF AND OTHERS THIS IS THE IMPRESSION THE MONKS GIVE OUT
THE WORDS FOR ALL THE LAW IS FULFILLED IN ONE WORD ENTAIL A CRITICISM OF THE GALATIANS
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU THE TRUE GOSPEL AND YOU RECEIVED IT WITH EAGERNESS AND GRATITUDE
DAVID FELL HORRIBLY INTO ADULTERY
THEY WENT ABOUT SAYS PAUL TO SPY OUT OUR LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE IN CHRIST JESUS THAT THEY MIGHT BRING US INTO BONDAGE WHEN PAUL SAW THROUGH THEIR SCHEME HE ATTACKED THE FALSE APOSTLES
PAUL SAYS THAT HE SAW PETER AND JAMES BUT HE DENIES THAT HE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THEM
WE WAIT IN SPIRIT BY FAITH FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH GREAT HOPE AND DESIRE TRUE WE ARE RIGHTEOUS BUT OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT YET REVEALED
SARAH KNEW THAT GOD HAD PROMISED TO MAKE HER HUSBAND ABRAHAM THE FATHER OF A NATION AND SHE HOPED THAT SHE WOULD BE THE MOTHER OF THIS PROMISED NATION
IN ORDER THAT THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL MAY CONTINUE
SOME ARE TEMPTED IN ONE WAY OTHERS IN ANOTHER WAY
IS IT THEREFORE NOT EXTREME FOLLY FOR ROME AND THE MOHAMMEDANS TO FIGHT EACH OTHER ABOUT RELIGION
BUT THANKS BE TO GOD WHO KEEPS US IN HIS WORD IN FAITH AND IN PRAYER
INSTEAD THEY ROB CHRIST
IT JUDGES ERRORS
THAT LIBERTY EXEMPTS THE CLERGY FROM CERTAIN PUBLIC CHARGES
IT IS SURPRISING THAT PETER EXCELLENT APOSTLE THAT HE WAS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH VACILLATION
VERSES 11 12
BUT WHEN THEIR FAITHFUL SHEPHERDS ARE GONE AND WOLVES DISGUISED AS SHEEP BREAK INTO THE FOLD BACK THEY GO TO THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE LAW
HE FELT HIMSELF TO BLAME
BEHOLD THY KING COMETH UNTO THEE ZECH
NO WONDER THEY ARE THE ETERNAL PREY OF DOUBT AND DESPAIR
IF THEY HAD ASKED IT ON THE PLEA OF BROTHERLY LOVE PAUL WOULD NOT HAVE DENIED THEM
NO WONDER PAUL PRONOUNCES CURSES UPON HIMSELF AND UPON OTHERS UPON THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN IF ANYONE SHOULD DARE TO PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL THAN CHRIST'S OWN
WHAT RIGHT HAVE WE TO RECEIVE PRAISE AND GLORY FOR GIFTS THAT ARE NOT OF OUR OWN MAKING
ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS WHETHER PEOPLE WILL LIKE AND PRAISE THEM
BUT WHY DOES PAUL ACCUSE THE GALATIANS OF REVERTING TO THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE LAW WHEN THEY NEVER HAD THE LAW
CHRIST WAS MADE THE CURSE ITSELF
NOW THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT OBTAINED BY THE LAW BUT BY FAITH IN CHRIST
HE HAS NO MASTER EXCEPT CHRIST
IT MUMBLES
INSTEAD HE HUMBLED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW FOR AND TOGETHER WITH THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW
WE HAVE ENOUGH ARGUMENTS RIGHT HERE TO CONCLUDE THAT JUSTIFICATION IS BY FAITH ALONE
IF PAUL HAD PREACHED THE LAW AND CIRCUMCISION IF HE HAD COMMENDED THE STRENGTH AND FREE WILL OF MAN HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO OBNOXIOUS TO THE JEWS
THEY FORESAW THE REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER OF THE GOSPEL
MANY HOWEVER ARE UNGRATEFUL
HOW ANGRY HE GETS AT THESE DECEIVERS
SO THIS IS YOUR PAUL WHOM YOU PRAISE SO MUCH
SUCH DIRECTIONS ARE DESIRABLE THAT ALL THINGS BE DONE DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I COR
THEREFORE IT BECOMES NECESSARY THAT SINCERE PREACHERS CULTIVATE THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS AS DILIGENTLY AS THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH FOR SATAN IS A DEADLY ENEMY OF BOTH
BUT WHEN THE SCRIPTURE SPEAKS OF REWARDS AND WORKS IT SPEAKS OF COMPOUND OR RELATIVE FAITH
I CAME TO JUDGE AND TO CONDEMN THE LAW SO THAT IT MAY NO MORE JUDGE AND CONDEMN THE WORLD HOW DID CHRIST MANAGE TO REDEEM US
THEY ACCUSED PAUL OF DESIGNS TO ABOLISH THE LAW OF GOD AND THE JEWISH DISPENSATION CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF GOD CONTRARY TO THEIR JEWISH HERITAGE CONTRARY TO APOSTOLIC EXAMPLE CONTRARY TO PAUL'S OWN EXAMPLE
BUT BEFORE FAITH CAME
PAUL RECEIVED HIS GOSPEL ON THE WAY TO DAMASCUS WHEN CHRIST APPEARED TO HIM
WHY DOES PAUL HARP ON THIS SEEMINGLY UNIMPORTANT FACT
SINCE CIRCUMCISION AND UNCIRCUMCISION ARE CONTRARY MATTERS WE WOULD EXPECT THE APOSTLE TO SAY THAT ONE OR THE OTHER MIGHT ACCOMPLISH SOME GOOD
NOT BECAUSE HE STOOD READY TO SACRIFICE HIS OWN SON ISAAC IN WHOM HE HAD THE PROMISE OF POSTERITY
I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHY ALL THE APOSTLES REITERATED THIS REQUEST WITH SUCH EMBARRASSING FREQUENCY
SUDDENLY THE HOLY GHOST ENTERS THEIR HEARTS
WELL I WISH THEY THEMSELVES WERE UTTERLY CUT OFF BY THE ROOTS WE HAD BETTER ANSWER AT ONCE THE QUESTION WHETHER IT IS RIGHT FOR CHRISTIANS TO CURSE
I SAY THE GOSPEL IS FRAIL BECAUSE WE ARE FRAIL
THEY SAID IF YOU DO NOT LIVE TO THE LAW YOU ARE DEAD UNTO GOD THE DOCTRINE OF OUR OPPONENTS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE FALSE APOSTLES IN PAUL'S DAY
IN THE SAME MANNER PAUL WAS CALLED AS THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES
OUR LIBERTY IS FOUNDED ON CHRIST HIMSELF WHO SITS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD AND INTERCEDES FOR US
DO YE NOT KNOW THAT THEY WHICH MINISTER ABOUT HOLY THINGS LIVE OF THE THINGS OF THE TEMPLE
THE VOICE OF THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIETH UNTO ME FROM THE GROUND CAIN BEGAN TO FEEL HIS IMPRISONMENT
WHEN IT COMES TO LIFE WE ARE READY TO DO TO SUFFER TO FORGIVE ANYTHING OUR OPPONENTS DEMAND AS LONG AS FAITH AND DOCTRINE REMAIN PURE AND UNCORRUPT
BUT PAUL INCLUDES ALL LAWS
FOR THE HOPE WHICH IS LAID UP FOR YOU IN HEAVEN I.E THE THING HOPED FOR
WHETHER A MAN MARRIES PROVIDES FOR HIS FAMILY AND IS AN HONEST CITIZEN
THIS IS PLAIN SPEAKING
WE DARE NO LONGER CONTINUE IN ERROR NOW THAT THE TRUTH HAS BEEN REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL
THE MERIT OF THE PASSION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND OF THE BLESSED SAINT MARY ALWAYS A VIRGIN AND OF ALL THE SAINTS
JEALOUS FOR ITS OWN RELIGIOUS VIEWS THE WORLD IN TURN CHARGES THE GOSPEL WITH BEING A SUBVERSIVE AND LICENTIOUS DOCTRINE OFFENSIVE TO GOD AND MAN A DOCTRINE TO BE PERSECUTED AS THE WORST PLAGUE ON EARTH
WHY WAS NINEVEH SPARED
IN HIS EPISTLE TO TITUS THE APOSTLE STATES THAT A VAINGLORIOUS MAN SHOULD NOT BE ORDAINED AS A MINISTER FOR PRIDE AS ST AUGUSTINE POINTS OUT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL HERESIES
GRACE DOES NOT SUDDENLY TRANSFORM A CHRISTIAN INTO A NEW AND PERFECT CREATURE
NOT CONTENT TO SPARE ME GOD GRANTED UNTO ME THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SALVATION HIS SPIRIT HIS SON THE OFFICE OF AN APOSTLE EVERLASTING LIFE PAUL SPEAKING
THE JEWS MISCONSTRUE THIS PASSAGE
WHEN I BOW DOWN MYSELF IN THE HOUSE OF RIMMON THE LORD PARDON THY SERVANT IN THIS THING WHAT DID THE PROPHET TELL HIM
THUS THE WORLD IS CRUCIFIED UNTO US AND WE UNTO THE WORLD
MY RIGHTEOUSNESS WAS A FILTHY PUDDLE
THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS THE HEAVY ARTILLERY OF THESE WORDS EXPLODES PAPACY WORKS MERITS SUPERSTITIONS
ON THE OTHER HAND NO MAN'S STANDING IS SO SECURE THAT HE MAY NOT FALL
ADAM THE DISOBEDIENT
IF HE ROSE AGAIN I MAY RISE AGAIN
IN HIS PRESENCE THEY DARED NOT TO OPEN THEIR MOUTHS
THOUGH THE FEARS OF THE LAW THE TERRORS OF SIN THE HORROR OF DEATH ASSAIL US OCCASIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THESE FEELINGS SHALL NOT ENDURE BECAUSE THE PROPHET QUOTES GOD AS SAYING
THE GROSSEST VICES ARE SMALL FAULTS IN COMPARISON WITH THE WISDOM AND RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE WORLD
PAUL SIMPLY HAD TO EXALT HIS OWN MINISTRY AND GOSPEL
PAUL NEVER DENIED THAT HE FELT THE LUST OF THE FLESH
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR US BUT TO BE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE
WE ANSWER WITH PAUL BY FAITH ONLY IN CHRIST ARE WE PRONOUNCED RIGHTEOUS AND NOT BY WORKS NOT THAT WE REJECT GOOD WORKS
IF THE WOMAN WOULD CHANGE PLACES WITH THE MAN IF THE SON WOULD CHANGE PLACES WITH THE FATHER THE SERVANT WITH THE MASTER NOTHING BUT CONFUSION WOULD RESULT
THE GOSPEL CARRIES THE NEWS THAT GOD FOR CHRIST'S SAKE IS MERCIFUL TO THE MOST UNWORTHY SINNERS IF THEY WILL ONLY BELIEVE THAT CHRIST BY HIS DEATH HAS DELIVERED THEM FROM SIN AND EVERLASTING DEATH UNTO GRACE FORGIVENESS AND EVERLASTING LIFE
WE WOULD NOT FEEL SO GOOD WHEN WE HAVE THEM
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY SPIRIT BY THE LAW
AND ONE OF THE FRUITS OF YOUR FAITH WAS THAT YOU LOVED ME SO DEVOTEDLY THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO PLUCK OUT YOUR EYES FOR ME TO LOVE A FELLOW-MAN SO DEVOTEDLY AS TO BE READY TO BESTOW UPON HIM MONEY GOODS EYES IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS SALVATION SUCH LOVE IS THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
PAUL'S INCREASING SEVERITY BECOMES APPARENT AS HE REMINDS THE GALATIANS THAT THEY DISOBEYED THE TRUTH IN DEFIANCE OF THE VIVID DESCRIPTION HE HAD GIVEN THEM OF CHRIST
BUT TO PLAY THE JEW AND FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE TO ABSTAIN FROM CERTAIN MEATS IS A DENIAL OF CHRIST
FOR ALL THE LAW IS FULFILLED IN ONE WORD
WE ARE THE CHILDREN AND HEIRS OF GOD THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST
IF CHARITABLE WORKS CAN FORM AND PERFECT FAITH I AM FORCED TO SAY EVENTUALLY THAT CHARITABLE DEEDS CONSTITUTE THE ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
HIS PRESENT MASTERY OVER THE LAW WAS OBTAINED BY VIRTUE OF HIS SONSHIP AND HIS SUBSTITUTIONARY VICTORY
IT PLEADS FOR OPEN HANDS TO TAKE WHAT IS BEING OFFERED
WE MUST SPEAK FRANKLY IN ORDER THAT AFFLICTED CONSCIENCES MAY FIND SURCEASE
SO THE LAW JUDGED AND HANGED HIM FOR A SINNER
FOR AS MANY AS ARE OF THE WORKS OF THE LAW ARE UNDER THE CURSE
IN SPITE OF IT ALL MY CONSCIENCE WAS ALWAYS IN A FEVER OF DOUBT
IMMEDIATELY I CONFERRED NOT WITH FLESH AND BLOOD
IMMEDIATELY I CONFERRED NOT WITH FLESH AND BLOOD
CIVIL OR LEGAL RIGHTEOUSNESS MAY BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS LIFE BUT NOT FOR THE LIFE HEREAFTER
EXAMPLES OF THESE SINS MAY BE GARNERED FROM THE PSALMS JOB JEREMIAH AND ALL THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
NEW ERRORS MUST APPEAR WITHOUT MEASURE AND WITHOUT END
LET EVERYBODY PERFORM THE DUTIES OF HIS STATION AND VOCATION DILIGENTLY AND HELP HIS NEIGHBOR TO THE LIMIT OF HIS CAPACITY
PASTORS AND MINISTERS MUST OF COURSE REBUKE THE FALLEN BUT WHEN THEY SEE THAT THE FALLEN ARE SORRY THEY ARE TO COMFORT THEM BY EXCUSING THE FAULT AS WELL AS THEY CAN
KNOWING PERSONS FIRST FIND FAULT WITH THEMSELVES IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY ALL THE MORE EARNESTLY REPROVE OTHERS
PETER DID NOT PROCLAIM A DIFFERENT GOSPEL NOR HAD HE APPOINTED HIS FELLOW APOSTLES
YOU GALATIANS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL FROM MY PREACHING AND FROM THE MANY AFFLICTIONS WHICH I HAVE ENDURED WHETHER I SERVE MEN OR GOD
THERE IS NEITHER JEW NOR GREEK THERE IS NEITHER BOND NOR FREE THERE IS NEITHER MALE NOR FEMALE
I WOULD NOT WANT TO DISCREDIT WITTENBERG AS PAUL DISCREDITED THE CORINTHIANS BY URGING THEM AT SUCH LENGTH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE RELIEF OF THE POOR
PAUL IS REPORTING PERSONAL HISTORY
IF THE APOSTLES WERE ANGELS FROM HEAVEN THAT WOULD NOT IMPRESS ME
UPON THIS FOUNDATION THE APOSTLE ERECTS THE STRUCTURE OF GOOD WORKS WHICH HE DEFINES IN THIS ONE SENTENCE
FOR IF I BUILD AGAIN THE THINGS WHICH I DESTROYED I MAKE MYSELF A TRANSGRESSOR
THEY ARE USUALLY REPAID WITH HATRED AND INGRATITUDE WE ARE BEING TREATED THAT WAY
FOR IF RIGHTEOUSNESS COME BY THE LAW THEN CHRIST IS DEAD IN VAIN
HIS LIFE IN THE FLESH IS NOT A LIFE AFTER THE FLESH
AS LONG AS WE LIVE HERE SIN STAYS WITH US NOT TO FORGET THE LAW IN OUR MEMBERS STRIVING AGAINST THE LAW OF OUR MIND
WITHOUT MINISTERS TO PROCLAIM THE WORD OF GOD THE PEOPLE GO WILD LIKE SAVAGE BEASTS
BUT THE FALSE APOSTLES TURNED PAUL'S CHARITABLE REGARD TO HIS DISADVANTAGE
OTHERWISE WE SHOULD NOT NEED A MEDIATOR
PAUL JUSTLY CALLS IT THE EVIL OR WICKED WORLD FOR WHEN THE WORLD IS AT ITS BEST THE WORLD IS AT ITS WORST
WE ARE NOT NOW DISCUSSING THE EXCELLENCY OF THE APOSTLES
EVERYTHING THEY DO IS WRONG
BY THIS DISTINCTION PAUL EXPLAINS WHY CHARITY WHICH IS THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY BECAUSE THE LAW CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO OUR JUSTIFICATION
WHO NOW REJOICE IN MY SUFFERINGS FOR YOU AND FILL UP THAT WHICH IS BEHIND OF THE AFFLICTIONS OF CHRIST IN MY FLESH FOR HIS BODY'S SAKE WHICH IS THE CHURCH COL
AS THOUGH SOLOMON WANTED TO SAY
BEFORE I WOULD ADMIT ANYTHING LIKE THAT I WOULD CONSIGN THE HOLINESS OF THE SAINTS AND OF THE ANGELS TO HELL
DO THIS AND THOU SHALT LIVE MEANS
OUR OWN FLESH THE WORLD THE LAW SIN DEATH THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD AND THE DEVIL HIMSELF
IF I KEEP ON LOOKING AT MYSELF I AM GONE
PAUL DECLARED THAT HE DID LIKEWISE THAT HE BECAME AS A JEW TO THE JEWS AND TO THEM THAT WERE WITHOUT LAW AS WITHOUT LAW
EVEN IF A PERSON HAS DONE ME SOME WRONG OR HAS HURT ME IN ANY WAY HE IS STILL A HUMAN BEING WITH FLESH AND BLOOD
WHEN THE APOSTLES HEARD THIS THEY WERE GLAD THAT I HAD TAUGHT THE TRUTH IF PAUL WOULD NOT GIVE IN TO THE FALSE APOSTLES MUCH LESS OUGHT WE TO GIVE IN TO OUR OPPONENTS
IT RISES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WRESTLES WITH THE SPIRIT
PAUL DOES NOT SAY THAT CHRIST WAS BORN OF MAN AND WOMAN BUT ONLY OF WOMAN
HE WAS ACCUSED OF BEING A PESTILENT FELLOW A MOVER OF SEDITION AMONG ALL THE JEWS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ACTS 24:5 IN PHILIPPI THE TOWNSPEOPLE CRIED THAT HE TROUBLED THEIR CITY AND TAUGHT CUSTOMS WHICH WERE NOT LAWFUL FOR THEM TO RECEIVE
NEXT THE HOLY GHOST IS SENT FORTH INTO THE HEARTS OF THE BELIEVERS AS HERE STATED GOD SENT THE SPIRIT OF HIS SON INTO YOUR HEARTS THIS SENDING IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL THROUGH WHICH THE HOLY SPIRIT INSPIRES US WITH FERVOR AND LIGHT WITH NEW JUDGMENT NEW DESIRES AND NEW MOTIVES
CONCERNING ZEAL PERSECUTING THE CHURCH
THE HATRED WAS MUTUAL
HE THAT TROUBLETH YOU SHALL BEAR HIS JUDGMENT WHOSOEVER HE BE HE PRONOUNCES A CURSE UPON THEM
THE LAW IS A PENNY'S WORTH WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH CHRIST
HE WILL DO IT FOR JESUS SAKE IN WHOM WE BELIEVE
THE GOSPEL IS TRUE BECAUSE IT DEPRIVES MEN OF ALL GLORY WISDOM AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TURNS OVER ALL HONOR TO THE CREATOR ALONE
THEY ROB CHRIST OF HIS GLORY AS THE JUSTIFIER OF MANKIND AND CAST HIM INTO THE ROLE OF A MINISTER OF SIN
IT IS EITHER GRACE OR LAW
YOU CANNOT REFUSE TO GIVE A PENNY WHO GIVES YOU ALL GOOD THINGS EVEN LIFE ETERNAL AND TURN AROUND AND GIVE THE DEVIL THE GIVER OF ALL EVIL AND DEATH ETERNAL PIECES OF GOLD AND NOT BE PUNISHED FOR IT
AS THE LAW REVEALS SIN IT FILLS A PERSON WITH THE FEAR OF DEATH AND CONDEMNATION
PAUL WARNS THE ROMANS NOT TO BRING CHRISTIANITY INTO DISREPUTE
WHEN A PHYSICIAN ADMINISTERS A BITTER POTION TO A PATIENT HE DOES IT TO CURE THE PATIENT
WITH THE SAME VEHEMENCE PAUL CONTINUES
ACCORDINGLY THE PROPER USE AND FUNCTION OF THE LAW IS TO THREATEN UNTIL THE CONSCIENCE IS SCARED STIFF
THE THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO RESIST THE FLESH BY THE SPIRIT
VERSE 8
VERSE 8
VERSE 8
VERSE 8
WE SHALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
LIKE PAUL WE ARE NOT TO BLAME THAT THE CHURCHES HAVE TROUBLE
HE WAS NOT ONLY IN THE COMPANY OF SINNERS
ACCORDING TO PAUL EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT OF FAITH IS SIN
ALL THEY DO IS TO SIT AND LISTEN TO PETER
SO DO NOT BE SURPRISED OR OFFENDED WHEN HELL BREAKS LOOSE
AT LEAST THEY HELP TO TIE THE DEVIL'S HANDS SO THAT HE DOES NOT RAGE UP AND DOWN THE EARTH
EVEN IN THE PRESENT DIFFUSION OF THE GOSPEL LIGHT I HAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO SEE CHRIST AS PAUL PORTRAYS HIM
FAITH IN LISTING FAITH AMONG THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT PAUL OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT MEAN FAITH IN CHRIST BUT FAITH IN MEN
THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE 2 GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE GOOD WILL TO MEN
HE WORSHIPPED AND PRAISED GOD
BOTH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL AND THE COMMANDMENT TO PREACH IT TO THE GENTILES PAUL RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM GOD
THESE FALSE APOSTLES DO NOT MERELY TROUBLE YOU THEY ABOLISH CHRIST'S GOSPEL
NAAMAN CONFESSED HIS FAITH
BUT IDOLATRY PUTS ON SUCH A GOOD FRONT AND ACTS SO SPIRITUAL THAT THE SHAM OF IT IS RECOGNIZED ONLY BY TRUE BELIEVERS
NO COMBINATION OF WORDS CAN DO JUSTICE TO SUCH AN OUTRAGE
BUT THE MAN THAT DOETH THEM SHALL LIVE IN THEM
ALL OTHERS ABIDE UNDER MY CURSE BECAUSE THEY WORSHIP CREATURES INSTEAD OF ME
THE POPE EXHIBITS A WORKING CHRIST OR AN EXEMPLARY CHRIST
THE FATHER LOVETH YOU BECAUSE YE HAVE LOVED ME AND HAVE BELIEVED THAT I CAME OUT FROM GOD
ALTHOUGH THE LAW HAS MANY CHILDREN THEY ARE NOT FREE
TO MIX LAW AND GOSPEL NOT ONLY CLOUDS THE KNOWLEDGE OF GRACE IT CUTS OUT CHRIST ALTOGETHER
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN TO CONTINUE IN SIN
THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT IN WORD BUT IN POWER THIS POWER REVEALED ITSELF NOT ONLY IN READINESS OF SPEECH BUT IN DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL ABILITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
I DO HOPE YOU WILL REPENT AND AMEND VERSE 5
HE DID NOT COME INTO THE WORLD FOR THE PURPOSE OF TEACHING THE LAW AS LITTLE AS IT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HIS COMING TO PERFORM MIRACLES
THEY ARE LIKE SPIDERS THAT SUCK VENOM OUT OF SWEET AND FRAGRANT FLOWERS
I SAW HOW THE GENEROSITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH WAS ENCOURAGING COVETOUSNESS ON THE PART OF THE CLERGY
THE APOSTLE IS SO WORKED UP OVER THIS MATTER THAT HE IS NOT CONTENT WITH A MERE ADMONITION
WITHOUT IT LIFE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE WORLD
PETER ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IN THE WORDS
NATURALLY THE POSSESSOR OF SUCH FAITH WILL BE DECEIVED BUT HE LETS IT PASS
WE ARE NOT TO LET SUCH TREATMENT CAUSE US TO FALTER IN OUR ADHERENCE TO CHRIST
AND SAY THE SCHOLASTICS BECAUSE GOD IS NOT SATISFIED WITH A LITERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW BUT EXPECTS US TO FULFILL THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE MIND OF THE LAWGIVER THEREFORE WE MUST OBTAIN FROM ABOVE A QUALITY ABOVE NATURE A QUALITY WHICH THEY CALL FORMAL RIGHTEOUSNESS WE SAY FAITH APPREHENDS JESUS CHRIST
PAUL EXPLAINS HOW THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DECEIVED BY FALSE TEACHERS MAY BE RESTORED TO SPIRITUAL HEALTH
WITHOUT HOPE FAITH CANNOT ENDURE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO COOL YOUR PERSONAL INTEREST IN ME THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME
THEY LOOKED UPON CIRCUMCISION AS A CONFESSION OF THEIR FAITH THE BELIEVING JEWS HOWEVER COULD NOT GET IT THROUGH THEIR HEADS THAT CIRCUMCISION WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR SALVATION
MORE AND MORE HOWEVER CHRIST INCREASES OUR FAITH AND IN THE MEASURE IN WHICH OUR FAITH IS INCREASED SIN LAW AND FLESH SUBSIDE
IF FAITH ALONE IN CHRIST JUSTIFIES THEN THE WHOLE LAW IS ABOLISHED WITHOUT EXCEPTION
REASON FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THIS FOR THE NATURAL MAN RECEIVETH NOT THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD I COR
MURDERERS AND THIEVES RECEIVE BETTER TREATMENT THAN CHRISTIANS
IF THEY DO NOT REPENT BUT OBSTINATELY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE DESIRES OF THE FLESH IT IS A SURE SIGN THAT THEY ARE NOT SINCERE
IF THE FAITH OF THE GENTILES HAD NOT PLEASED THE HOLY GHOST HE WOULD NOT HAVE MANIFESTED HIS PRESENCE IN THE UNCIRCUMCISED HEARERS OF THE WORD
THEY SAY A PERSON WHO PERFORMS THIS GOOD DEED OR THAT DESERVES THE FORGIVENESS OF HIS SINS
TO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING AS IF A PERSON WHO IS ALREADY WEAK AND FEEBLE SHOULD TRY TO FIND STRENGTH IN WEAKNESS OR AS IF A PERSON WITH THE DROPSY SHOULD SEEK A CURE BY EXPOSING HIMSELF TO THE PESTILENCE OR AS IF A LEPER SHOULD GO TO A LEPER AND A BEGGAR TO A BEGGAR TO FIND HEALTH AND WEALTH
I TEACH THINGS ONLY THAT I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED TO TEACH FROM ABOVE
MOSES AND CHRIST
CHRIST AND MY CONSCIENCE MUST BECOME ONE SO THAT I CAN SEE NOTHING ELSE BUT CHRIST CRUCIFIED AND RAISED FROM THE DEAD FOR ME
ANXIOUS LEST HE SHOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD HE IS CAREFUL TO LET THEM SEE THAT HIS CRITICISM PROCEEDS FROM AFFECTION AND A TRUE APOSTOLIC CONCERN FOR THEIR WELFARE
ON ONE OCCASION THE APOSTLE WROTE
IF THEY HAD TAKEN BETTER HOLD OF THE WORD THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED SO EASILY
IF THE LAW COULD JUSTIFY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE THE LAW
BUT PRESENTLY HE CORRECTS HIMSELF SAYING YET NOT I BUT CHRIST LIVETH IN ME HE IS THE FORM OF MY PERFECTION
I MARVEL THAT YE ARE SO SOON REMOVED
THEY AVOID THE CROSS THEY TEACH NO CERTAIN TRUTHS
HE WENT TO JERUSALEM IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE TRUE GOSPEL FOR THE GALATIAN CHURCHES AND FOR ALL THE CHURCHES OF THE GENTILES
HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE NOT MALICIOUS ONLY WEAK WHO MAY TAKE OFFENSE WHEN TOLD THAT LAW AND GOOD WORKS ARE UNNECESSARY FOR SALVATION
THE FULLNESS OF THE TIME MEANS WHEN THE TIME OF THE LAW WAS FULFILLED AND CHRIST WAS REVEALED
OF COURSE IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS CHANGING ONE'S CLOTHES
BUT IN REALITY I FIRST LIVE NOW NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN DELIVERED FROM THE LAW FROM SIN AND DEATH
THEN FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER I WENT UP AGAIN TO JERUSALEM
NO MAN KNOWETH WHO THE FATHER IS BUT THE SON AND HE TO WHOM THE SON WILL REVEAL HIM LUKE 10:22 BY HIS KNOWLEDGE SHALL MY RIGHTEOUS SERVANT JUSTIFY MANY
I RECEIVED MY POWER NOT FROM PETER BUT FROM THE SAME GOD THE SAME SPIRIT WHO WAS MIGHTY IN PETER WAS MIGHTY IN ME ALSO LUKE CORROBORATES PAUL'S STATEMENT IN THE WORDS
THEY WERE NOT MADE OF IRON
SUCH FORCEFUL RESTRAINT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS RIGHTEOUSNESS RATHER AS AN INDICATION OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
INDEED HE DOES
THE GOSPEL SUPPLIES THE WORLD WITH THE SALVATION OF JESUS CHRIST PEACE OF CONSCIENCE AND EVERY BLESSING
DAVID SAID
PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF LUKE 4:23 THE APOSTLE TELLS THE GALATIANS THAT HE WILL KEEP THEIR KINDNESS IN PERPETUAL REMEMBRANCE
MAY THE READER ACCEPT WITH INDULGENCE WHERE IN THIS TRANSLATION WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN MODERNIZING LUTHER'S EXPRESSION--MAKING HIM TALK AMERICAN AT THE END OF HIS LECTURES IN 1531 LUTHER UTTERED A BRIEF PRAYER AND THEN DICTATED TWO SCRIPTURAL TEXTS WHICH WE SHALL INSCRIBE AT THE END OF THESE INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD NOW AND THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL
YOU ARE NO GOOD AT ALL SATAN IS TO BE ANSWERED IN THIS WAY
VERSE 26
VERSE 26
VERSE 26
VERSE 26
IF WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW TELL ME WHAT HAS CHRIST ACHIEVED BY HIS DEATH BY HIS PREACHING BY HIS VICTORY OVER SIN AND DEATH
AND THE LAW IS NOT OF FAITH
THIS I SAY THEN WALK IN THE SPIRIT AND YE SHALL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH
THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW IS THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LAW ACCORDING TO THE PASSAGE
IF ANYBODY OBJECTS TO THE GOSPEL AND THE SACRAMENTS ON THE GROUND THAT CHRIST HAS TAKEN AWAY OUR SINS ONCE AND FOR ALWAYS YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER
IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE SCHOLASTICS PAUL DECLARES
IN LABORS MORE ABUNDANT IN STRIPES ABOVE MEASURE IN PRISONS MORE FREQUENT IN DEATHS OFT
WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW
SHUT UP UNTO THE FAITH WHICH SHOULD AFTERWARDS BE REVEALED
IT CANNOT REGENERATE US
THAT IS THE RIGHT KIND OF PREACHING FOR GENTILES VERSE 16
AND THESE ALL DO CONTRARY TO THE DECREES OF CAESAR SO SAID THE JEWS OF PAUL AND SILAS
IF YE WERE OF THE WORLD THE WORLD WOULD LOVE HIS OWN BUT BECAUSE YE ARE NOT OF THE WORLD BUT I HAVE CHOSEN YOU OUT OF THE WORLD THEREFORE THE WORLD HATETH YOU JOHN 15:19 IN OTHER WORDS
WE SAY WITH PAUL THAT THE LAW IS GOOD IF IT IS USED PROPERLY
TO BOLSTER THEIR EVIL CAUSE SAYS HE THE FALSE APOSTLES QUOTE THE AUTHORITY OF THE GREAT APOSTLES AGAINST ME
YOU MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW
CIRCUMCISION AND THE LAW AND GOOD WORKS ARE CARNAL
I HAVE ABOLISHED THE LAW SO THAT IT SHOULD NOT BOTHER YOUR CONSCIENCE ANY MORE
IN HOLDING OUT AGAINST THEM SAYS PAUL I CONSERVED THE TRUTH OF THE PURE GOSPEL NOW THE TRUE GOSPEL HAS IT THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY FAITH ALONE WITHOUT THE DEEDS OF THE LAW
AND HE SAW IT AND WAS GLAD JOHN 8:56 THE FAITH OF THE FATHERS WAS DIRECTED AT THE CHRIST WHO WAS TO COME WHILE OURS RESTS IN THE CHRIST WHO HAS COME
THE MOMENT I OPEN MY MOUTH THE POPE BEGINS TO FUME AND TO RAGE
THE OFFENSE IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT GOD CANNOT PARDON IT
WE HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THE DEVIL LEST HE SOW TARES AMONG THE WHEAT WHILE WE SLEEP
IF OUR ANTAGONISTS WOULD READ THE SCRIPTURES THEY WOULD SOON DISCOVER THAT THEY CANNOT JUDGE RIGHTLY OF ANYTHING EITHER OF SIN OR OF HOLINESS
ARE YE SO FOOLISH
FORGIVENESS OF SINS MUST BE CONTINUOUS SO THAT SIN AND ERROR MAY NOT BE DEFENDED AND SUSTAINED
I DO NOT WANT TO WITHHOLD FROM GOOD WORKS THEIR DUE PRAISE NOR DO I WISH TO ENCOURAGE EVIL WORKS
WHY WAS HE CRUCIFIED
DO NOT CONSULT THAT QUACKDOCTOR REASON
THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS GO AGAINST REASON
THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE OF THE LAW THE LAW HAS A TWOFOLD PURPOSE
PAUL THE PERSECUTOR
WHAT SORT OF CHARITY IS THIS
NOTHING SUITS THEM EXCEPT WHAT THEY DO
BUT PAUL SAYS
BUT GOD MAKES IT SIMPLE
I SIMPLY ATTACH MYSELF TO THE HUMAN CHRIST AND I FIND JOY AND PEACE AND THE WISDOM OF GOD IN HIM
LIKEWISE THE SPIRIT ALSO HELPETH OUR INFIRMITIES
WORKS DO JUSTIFY WITH MUD IN THEIR EYES THEY CANNOT SEE THAT THE TEXT SAYS IN GENESIS THAT THE LORD HAD RESPECT TO THE PERSON OF ABEL FIRST
BUT CIVIL RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL NEVER DELIVER A PERSON FROM THE CONDEMNATION OF GOD'S LAW
THE LAW IS GOOD HOLY AND PROFITABLE BUT IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY
OUR OPPONENTS HAVE THEIR ANSWER READY-MADE
THE APOSTLE IS INCENSED AT THE PRESUMPTUOUSNESS OF ANY PERSON WHO THINKS HE CAN PERFORM THE LAW OF GOD TO HIS OWN SALVATION
ALL THESE THINGS CRY OUT AGAINST US
THE BARS AND THE CHAINS RESTRAIN HIM
WE WILL DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS SOME OTHER TIME
THEY ARE HIS DARLINGS FOR THEY QUICKLY DESTROY THEIR BODY AND SOUL BY DEPRIVING THEM OF THE BLESSINGS OF GOD'S GENEROUS GIFTS
IF I HAD NO SIN I SHOULD NOT NEED CHRIST
GOD IS MY WITNESS YOU HAVE DONE ME NO WRONG
AMONG THE DISCIPLES WERE SOME THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS OF THE JEWS
IN THEE SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED VERSE 9
BUT BECAUSE THEY ATTACH MORE IMPORTANCE TO CHARITY THAN TO FAITH IN CHRIST THEY DISHONOR HIM AND PERVERT HIS WORD
AND HE BARE THE SIN OF MANY AND MADE INTERCESSION FOR THE TRANSGRESSORS ISAIAH 53:12 ALL THE PROPHETS OF OLD SAID THAT CHRIST SHOULD BE THE GREATEST TRANSGRESSOR MURDERER ADULTERER THIEF BLASPHEMER THAT EVER WAS OR EVER COULD BE ON EARTH
WHEN I WAS A MONK I TRIED EVER SO HARD TO LIVE UP TO THE STRICT RULES OF MY ORDER
AS LONG AS YOU WERE SERVANTS OF THE LAW YOU NEVER RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST
TAKE THIS GIFT OF GOD IF THE INHERITANCE OF THE GIFTS OF GOD WERE OBTAINED BY THE LAW GOD WOULD BE A LIAR
NATHAN TOLD DAVID THAT HE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND BUILD THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
GOD ACCEPTETH NO MAN'S PERSON
IN ACTUAL LIVING HOWEVER IT IS NOT SO EASY TO PERSUADE ONESELF THAT BY GRACE ALONE IN OPPOSITION TO EVERY OTHER MEANS WE OBTAIN THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS AND PEACE WITH GOD
WHEN CHRIST CAME HE ABOLISHED THE LAW AND BROUGHT LIBERTY AND LIFE TO LIGHT
AS IT IS THE PRAISE OF MEN STOPS WHEN WE DIE
THIRDLY THE LAW IS ABUSED BY THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAW IS MEANT TO DRIVE US TO CHRIST
PAUL CONCLUDES THE WHOLE MATTER WITH THE ABOVE STATEMENT
THE LORD IS OUR GLORY
IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT IT IS NOT OUR FAULT
HOW WAS IT WITH CORNELIUS
A LITTLE LEAVEN LEAVENETH THE WHOLE LUMP
THIS SENTENCE CLINCHES PAUL'S ARGUMENT
THE FALSE APOSTLES MIGHT SAY WHO KNOWS WHETHER PAUL IS TELLING THE TRUTH PAUL THE ELECT VESSEL OF GOD WAS HELD IN SO LITTLE ESTEEM BY HIS OWN GALATIANS TO WHOM HE HAD PREACHED CHRIST THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO SWEAR AN OATH THAT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH
HE DESCENDED UPON CHRIST IN THE FORM OF A DOVE MATT
THIS SHOWS HOW THE PAPISTS IGNORE THE SCRIPTURES PARTICULARLY THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH
THERE IS DISCORD BETWEEN GOD AND US
I HAD BEEN AN ENEMY OF CHRIST
THE APOSTLE PROCEEDS TO EXPLAIN THE SERVICE WHICH THE LAW IS TO RENDER
EVERY RELIGION WHICH WORSHIPS GOD IN IGNORANCE OR NEGLECT OF HIS WORD AND WILL IS IDOLATRY
THE APPLE DOES NOT MAKE THE TREE
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE GENTILES WITHOUT DELAY BECAUSE CHRIST HAD CALLED ME FOR THAT PURPOSE THIS STATEMENT REFUTES THE ASSERTION OF THE FALSE APOSTLES THAT PAUL HAD BEEN A PUPIL OF THE APOSTLES FROM WHICH THE FALSE APOSTLES INFERRED THAT PAUL HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE OBEDIENCE OF THE LAW THAT THEREFORE THE GENTILES ALSO OUGHT TO KEEP THE LAW AND SUBMIT TO CIRCUMCISION
BUT CHRIST IS NO LAW GIVER
TITUS WHO WAS WITH PAUL WAS NOT COMPELLED TO BE CIRCUMCISED ALTHOUGH HE STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE APOSTLES WHEN THIS QUESTION OF CIRCUMCISION WAS DEBATED
MISTER LAW YOU COME TOO SOON
HE REFERS TO THESE IN II CORINTHIANS 7:6 WITHOUT WERE FIGHTINGS WITHIN WERE FEARS IN HIS LETTER TO THE PHILIPPIANS PAUL MAKES MENTION OF THE RESTORATION OF EPAPHRODITUS AS A SPECIAL ACT OF MERCY ON THE PART OF GOD LEST I SHOULD HAVE SORROW UPON SORROW CONSIDERING THE MANY AFFLICTIONS OF PAUL WE ARE NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR HIM LOUDLY PRAISING THE GALATIANS FOR NOT BEING OFFENDED AT HIM AS OTHERS WERE
VOID OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THEY TEACH WHAT THEY PLEASE AS LONG AS IT SOUNDS GOOD TO THE COMMON PEOPLE WHO ARE EVER READY TO JOIN SOMETHING NEW
GOD ACCOUNTS THIS FAITH FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
THEY LIVE IN SECURITY WITHOUT CONFLICT
TO SHOW THAT THE LAW HAS BEEN QUITE ABOLISHED THE EARTHLY JERUSALEM WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED WITH ALL HER ORNAMENTS TEMPLES AND CEREMONIES
THIS SPIRIT OF MANY BLESSINGS IS RECEIVED BY FAITH ALONE
AND ALL GOOD THINGS TEMPORAL
I AM ALL RIGHT WITH GOD
WHEN THEY HEARD ALL THIS THEY GLORIFIED GOD FOR HIS GRACE IN ME HENCE PAUL WAS JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE APOSTLES WERE FOR HIM AND NOT AGAINST HIM
BEFORE THE ETERNAL JUDGE IT IS NOT PRAISE THAT COUNTS BUT YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
HE KNOWS THAT PLAIN PEOPLE ARE SOONER IMPRESSED BY AN APT ILLUSTRATION THAN BY LEARNED DISCUSSION
COME ON NOW MY SMART GALATIANS YOU WHO ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS WHILE I SEEM TO BE YOUR PUPIL
THEIR BELIEF GOES AGAINST FAITH AND CHRIST
BUT THEY RAN AWAY
GOD WILL NO MORE REQUIRE OF MAN THAN OF HIMSELF PERFORM HE CAN THIS MAY HOLD TRUE IN ORDINARY CIVIC LIFE
TO THINK IF FAITH JUSTIFIES WITHOUT WORKS LET US WORK NOTHING IS TO DESPISE THE GRACE OF GOD
TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER IN LOVE I.E TO INSTRUCT THE ERRING TO COMFORT THE AFFLICTED TO RAISE THE FALLEN TO HELP ONE'S NEIGHBOR IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY TO BEAR WITH HIS INFIRMITIES TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS TOIL INGRATITUDE IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE WORLD AND ON THE OTHER HAND TO OBEY GOVERNMENT TO HONOR ONE'S PARENTS TO BE PATIENT AT HOME WITH A NAGGING WIFE AND AN UNRULY FAMILY THESE THINGS ARE NOT AT ALL REGARDED AS GOOD WORKS
BEFORE THAT HE WAS A VERY HOLY MAN
TWO THINGS MAKE FOR CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS
YOUR INGRATITUDE GRIEVES ME
THERE IS NOT ONE AMONG US WHO IS NOT AT TIMES SEDUCED BY SATAN INTO FALSE BELIEFS
AND MY TEMPTATION WHICH WAS IN MY FLESH YE DESPISED NOT NOR REJECTED
IF YOU THINK CHRIST AND THE LAW CAN DWELL TOGETHER IN YOUR HEART YOU MAY BE SURE THAT CHRIST DWELLS NOT IN YOUR HEART
WAS NOT ABRAHAM YOUR FATHER OF WHOM YOU MAKE SO MUCH JUSTIFIED AND SAVED WITHOUT CIRCUMCISION AND THE LAW BY FAITH ALONE PAUL THEREFORE CONCLUDES
FIRST IN THE PROMISES CONCERNING CHRIST IN GENESIS 3:15 AND IN GENESIS 22:18 WHICH SPEAK OF THE SEED OF THE WOMAN AND THE SEED OF ABRAHAM
GOD DOES NOT AMUSE HIMSELF WITH WORDS
THEY HAVE NOT REJECTED THEE BUT THEY HAVE REJECTED ME I SAM
SELDOM IF EVER ARE THEIR EFFORTS CROWNED WITH GRATITUDE
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT FAITH IN THE FIRST PART OF MY LETTER
HE KNOWS PEOPLE LIKE ILLUSTRATIONS AND STORIES
IT INCREASES SIN
HIS PERSON IS DIVINE AND HUMAN
WE DO NOT THINK OF OUR GROANINGS AS A CRYING
WHEN THEIR SINS WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THESE MEN DID NOT OBSTINATELY CONTINUE IN THEIR SIN BUT REPENTED
NO WONDER THAT GOD IN HIS SPECIAL GRACE SUBJECTS THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL TO ALL KINDS OF AFFLICTIONS OTHERWISE THEY COULD NOT COPE WITH THIS UGLY BEAST CALLED VAINGLORY
FAITH IS ABLE TO JUSTIFY BECAUSE IT APPREHENDS CHRIST THE REDEEMER
I AM LOVED BY YOU BECAUSE OF THE BELOVED THIS ONE LITTLE WORD ABBA SURPASSES THE ELOQUENCE OF A DEMOSTHENES AND A CICERO
THESE ROSE AGAINST PAUL IN QUICK INDIGNATION ACCUSING HIM OF PROPAGATING A GOSPEL OF LAWLESSNESS
WITHOUT CHRIST MEN WILL ENTERTAIN FALSE IDEAS ABOUT GOD CALL THEIR IDEAS WHAT YOU LIKE THE LAWS OF MOSES THE ORDINANCES OF THE POPE THE KORAN OF THE MOHAMMEDANS OR WHAT HAVE YOU
IF THEY WANT TO CONDEMN CHRIST FOR BEING OUR SAVIOR AND REDEEMER THAT IS THEIR LOOKOUT
THE LAW DOES NOT CANCEL THE PROMISE BUT FAITH IN THE PROMISED CHRIST CANCELS THE LAW
IF ALL MEN KNOW GOD HOW CAN PAUL SAY THAT THE GALATIANS DID NOT KNOW GOD PRIOR TO THE HEARING OF THE GOSPEL
THE WORKS OF THE LAW ACCORDING TO PAUL INCLUDE THE WHOLE LAW JUDICIAL CEREMONIAL MORAL
SUCH MERE OUTWARD DECENCY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE CHRISTIANITY
BUT THIS SIN THIS OPINION OF MAN'S OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS REFUSES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS SIN
TO MAN'S REASON OUR FAITH LOOKS RATHER FORLORN
TROUBLE ME NO MORE VERSE 17
BUT PAUL HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS BOASTING
HE THOUGHT HE COULD PASS IT OFF AS AN INCIDENT WITH A SHRUG OF THE SHOULDER
1:17 HERE SOMEONE MAY BE TEMPTED TO CALL THE CHRISTIANS CRAZY
MEN FAST PRAY WATCH SUFFER
WHEN I WAS A MONK I THOUGHT I WAS LOST FOREVER WHENEVER I FELT AN EVIL EMOTION CARNAL LUST WRATH HATRED OR ENVY
OTHERWISE THE INFIDELS WOULD BE NEARER HEAVEN THAN THE CHRISTIANS FOR INFIDELS OFTEN EXCEL IN CIVIL RIGHTEOUSNESS
PARDON OUR INIQUITY AND OUR SIN CHRIST ALONE CAN MAKE US INNOCENT OF ANY TRANSGRESSION
IT IS A MATTER THAT INVOLVES EVERLASTING LIBERTY OR EVERLASTING SLAVERY
BY STRIPPING CHRIST OF OUR SINS BY MAKING HIM SINLESS THEY CAST OUR SINS BACK AT US AND MAKE CHRIST ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS TO US
THEY HAVE A RHYME FOR IT
HE ARGUES
DIVERSE OPINIONS AND DISSENSIONS ABOUT DOCTRINE AND LIFE SPRING UP AND ONE MEMBER BITES AND DEVOURS THE OTHER I.E THEY CONDEMN EACH OTHER UNTIL THEY ARE CONSUMED
THE FIRST STEP TO BEING A CHRISTIAN IS TO HEAR THE GOSPEL
WHY NOT ACCEPT GIFTS WITH JOY AND THANKSGIVING
THEY CONDEMN PAUL PAUL CONDEMNS THEM
NINEVEH THAT GREAT CITY WAS JUSTIFIED AND RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF GOD THAT HE WOULD NOT DESTROY THE CITY
THE LAW-RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS THE WORST KIND OF INFIDEL
VERSE 23
VERSE 23
VERSE 23
VERSE 23
HEAVEN AND EARTH OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT HIM AND ABOUT HIS FAITH IN CHRIST
TO BEAR WITH THE INFIRMITY OF A BROTHER IS A GOOD THING
EVEN WE CREATURES OF THE WORLD DO NOT PERFORM OUR DUTIES AS ZEALOUSLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL AS WE DID BEFORE IN THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE BECAUSE THE SURER WE ARE OF THE LIBERTY PURCHASED FOR US BY CHRIST THE MORE WE NEGLECT THE WORD PRAYER WELL-DOING AND SUFFERING
THE MONASTERIES RECRUIT THE YOUTH ON THE PLEA THAT THEIR HOLY ORDERS WILL ASSUREDLY RECRUIT THEM FOR HEAVEN
AND THIS IS OUR GLORY TODAY WITH THE POPE AND THE WHOLE WORLD PERSECUTING US AND TRYING TO KILL US
THERE ARE OTHER AND BETTER THINGS THAN YOU
BUT FEELING LOW YOU FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF FOR YOUR SINS
IN THE NINTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS ST PAUL ADVANCES THE SAME ARGUMENT WHICH HE AMPLIFIES INTO AN ALLEGORY IN WRITING TO THE GALATIANS
YOU WANT TO DIE WILLINGLY AND PATIENTLY AND THEN YOU WILL MERIT REMISSION OF YOUR SINS AND ETERNAL LIFE WHAT CRUELTY IS THIS THAT A WRETCHED THIEF MURDERER ROBBER SHOULD BE SO MISERABLY MISGUIDED IN HIS EXTREME DISTRESS THAT AT THE VERY POINT OF DEATH HE SHOULD BE DENIED THE SWEET PROMISES OF CHRIST AND DIRECTED TO HOPE FOR PARDON OF HIS SINS IN THE WILLINGNESS AND PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE IS ABOUT TO SUFFER DEATH FOR HIS CRIMES
HIS BIRTH MAKES HIM AN HEIR NOT HIS LABORS
I SAW BISHOPS AND PRIESTS GROW RICH UNTIL THEY POSSESSED THE CHOICEST REAL ESTATE
IF WE PERMIT MOSES TO RULE OVER US IN ONE THING WE MUST OBEY HIM IN ALL THINGS
WE NEVER COME BY THIS LOVE NATURALLY NEITHER CAN IT BE ENFORCED BY LAWS
IN TIMES OF JOY AND GLADNESS THAT I MAY HAVE HIM AS A MIRROR TO REFLECT UPON MY SHORTCOMINGS
ALL WHO TRUST IN THEIR OWN MERITS TO SAVE THEM DISREGARD THIS PRINCIPLE AND LOSE SIGHT OF THE MEDIATOR JESUS CHRIST
THIS CONCLUDES PAUL'S DISCOURSE ON JUSTIFICATION
WHEN THEY NOTICED THAT PAUL MADE SO MUCH ADO ABOUT A MATTER THAT SEEMED OF NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THEM THEY RAISED THEIR EYEBROWS AND THOUGHT WITHIN THEMSELVES
DID THE LAW EVER SACRIFICE ITSELF FOR ME
THE WHOLE SCRIPTURE HOWEVER TESTIFIES THAT CHRIST HAS COME THAT BY HIS DEATH HE HAS ABOLISHED THE LAW AND THAT HE HAS FULFILLED ALL THINGS WHICH THE PROPHETS HAVE FORETOLD ABOUT HIM
YOU CANNOT DO A THING TO BE DELIVERED FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE LAW
HE ATE AND DRANK WITH THE GENTILES UNCONCERNED ABOUT THE JEWISH LAW
THE WORLD IS DARKNESS
THEY DEFEND THEIR BLASPHEMIES
THERE IS NEITHER PREACHER NOR HEARER NEITHER TEACHER NOR SCHOLAR NEITHER MASTER NOR SERVANT ETC
PAUL EXALTS HIS MINISTRY OUT OF THE DESIRE TO MAKE KNOWN THE NAME THE GRACE AND THE MERCY OF GOD
WE DO NOT HATE THE POPE AS TO WISH HIM ILL
THEY ARE INTERESTED ONLY IN MAINTAINING THEIR POSITION
LONGSUFFERING LONGSUFFERING IS THAT QUALITY WHICH ENABLES A PERSON TO BEAR ADVERSITY INJURY REPROACH AND MAKES THEM PATIENT TO WAIT FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THOSE WHO HAVE DONE HIM WRONG
THOUGH THIS SUPPORT IS SOMETHING PHYSICAL THE APOSTLE DOES NOT HESITATE TO CALL IT SOWING TO THE SPIRIT
HEBREW WRITING IS INTERSPERSED WITH EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE AND GRATITUDE
MY REPLY IS CURSED BE ANY LOVE OR HARMONY WHICH DEMANDS FOR ITS PRESERVATION THAT WE PLACE THE WORD OF GOD IN JEOPARDY
HUNGRY HEARTS APPRECIATE CHRIST
WILL YOU ALLOW YOURSELVES TO BE CARRIED AWAY SO EASILY FROM THE LIVING FOUNTAIN OF GRACE AND LIFE VERSE 6
IT IS THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
THE TROUBLE WITH THESE SEEKERS AFTER GLORY IS THAT THEY NEVER STOP TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEIR MINISTRY IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FAITHFUL
CHAPTER 1 VERSE 1
OUR FEEBLE GROANS ABBA FATHER WILL BE HEARD OF GOD SOONER THAN THE COMBINED RACKET OF HELL SIN AND THE LAW
IN THIS VERSE THE APOSTLE CONTINUES HIS ATTACK UPON THE VAINGLORIOUS SECTARIANS
CONFRONTED BY THE ARMIES OF PHARAOH RETREAT CUT OFF BY THE WATERS OF THE RED SEA MOSES WAS IN A BAD SPOT
SUCH EXAMPLES OF WHICH THE SCRIPTURES ARE FULL OUGHT TO WARN US NOT TO REPOSE OUR TRUST IN MEN
HE IS OUR GOD AND OUR FATHER
GOD MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CALL A FEW WHO IN THEIR FAILURE TO DISCOVER ANY GOOD IN THEMSELVES TO CITE AGAINST THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD SIMPLY TOOK TO THE SUFFERING AND DEATH OF CHRIST AND WERE SAVED BY THIS SIMPLE FAITH
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL WHO FEAR GOD ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO INTEND TO BECOME MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL TO LEARN FROM THE APOSTLE THE PROPER USE OF THE LAW
TRANSGRESSION ANSWERS THE APOSTLE
YOUR EXPERIENCE OUGHT TO TEACH YOU THAT THE FRUITS OF LOVE DO NOT GROW ON THE STUMP OF THE LAW
TO CROWN IT ALL HE CALLED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO OTHERS VERSE 15
THEY AT LEAST FEEL REMORSE
WORST OF ALL THEY FORCE CIRCUMCISION UPON YOU FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE SATISFACTION THEY GET OUT OF YOUR SUBMISSION
WOULD TO GOD THAT THIS TERRIBLE PRONOUNCEMENT OF THE APOSTLE MIGHT STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF ALL WHO PERVERT THE GOSPEL OF PAUL
PAUL HAD ALREADY BEEN CALLED ENLIGHTENED AND TAUGHT BY CHRIST IN THE ROAD
REJOICE FOR YOUR NAMES ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN PEACE PEACE TOWARDS GOD AND MEN
BUT WE MAY APPLY THE HISTORICAL FACT TO OUR INNER LIFE
IF A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL IS PRAISED HE IS IN DANGER
LET HIM SAY TO HIMSELF
SINCE WE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE OR THE OTHER LET US CHOOSE GOD
IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY
OUR OPPONENTS COME BACK AT US WITH CORNELIUS
SO MUCH IS CERTAIN BEFORE THE LAW EVER EXISTED GOD GAVE ABRAHAM THE INHERITANCE OR BLESSING BY THE PROMISE
THE CHURCH DOES NOT LOOK PROSPEROUS
BLESSED BE GOD AND HIS WORD AND CURSED BE EVERYTHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO GOD AND HIS WORD EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE AN APOSTLE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THIS GOES TO SHOW AGAIN HOW MUCH IMPORTANCE PAUL ATTACHED TO THE LEAST POINTS OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT HE DARED TO CURSE THE FALSE APOSTLES EVIDENTLY MEN OF GREAT POPULARITY AND INFLUENCE
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU OUGHT TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR ASK YOURSELF HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOURSELF
THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES
BE WATCHFUL
IF HE DID NOT LOVE THE LAD HE WOULD NOT PUNISH HIM BUT LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY IN EVERYTHING UNTIL HE COMES TO HARM
SAINT BERNARD OBSERVED THAT THE CHURCH IS IN BEST SHAPE WHEN SATAN ASSAULTS IT ON EVERY SIDE BY TRICKERY AND VIOLENCE
IF IT HAMMERS AWAY TOO LONG NO PERSON WOULD AND COULD BE SAVED
VERSE 19
VERSE 19

WHEN THE PROPHETS FORETOLD THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM THE JEWS STONED THEM AS BLASPHEMERS OF GOD
THIS IS NOT OUR DOCTRINE
THE MORE FULLY WE BELIEVE THIS THE FULLER WILL BE OUR JOY
PROVOKING ONE ANOTHER ENVYING ONE ANOTHER
IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT PAUL BEARS DOWN ON THIS ARGUMENT
INWARDLY IT CONSISTS IN FAITH TOWARDS GOD OUTWARDLY IN LOVE TOWARDS OUR FELLOW-MEN
VERSE 11
VERSE 11
VERSE 11
VERSE 11
VERSE 11
HE ADDS FOR GOOD MEASURE THE ARGUMENT THAT HE DOES NOT STAND ALONE BUT THAT ALL THE BRETHREN WITH HIM ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT HIS DOCTRINE IS DIVINELY TRUE
THEY DO NOT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO WRATH OR ENVY BUT PREFER OTHERS TO THEMSELVES
BUT OURS IS A DOCTRINE OF GRACE AND PEACE
AND WAS UNKNOWN BY FACE UNTO THE CHURCHES OF JUDAEA WHICH WERE IN CHRIST
WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THE ONE LITTLE WORD SIN EMBRACES THE WHOLE KINGDOM OF SATAN AND THAT IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING THAT IS HORRIBLE WE HAVE REASON TO TREMBLE
IF YOU KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS IT SHALL BE WELL WITH THEE VERSE 25
REV
BEAR THE INFIRMITIES OF YOUR BROTHER
THEY RETAIN THE APPEARANCE AND THE NAME OF THE GOSPEL AND OF CHRIST FOR A DECOY ONLY
CHRISTIANS ARE GLAD TO HEAR AND OBEY THIS TEACHING OF LOVE
I FEAR MANY OF YOU HAVE STRAYED SO FAR THAT YOU WILL NEVER RETURN TO THE TRUTH THE APOSTASY OF THE GALATIANS IS A FINE INDORSEMENT OF THE LAW ALL RIGHT
WHEREVER WE PREACHED TO THE GENTILES THE HOLY GHOST CAME UPON THOSE WHO RECEIVED THE WORD
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CHRISTIAN LIBERTY AND THEN GO AND CATER TO THE DESIRES OF COVETOUSNESS PLEASURE PRIDE ENVY AND OTHER VICES
LORD INCREASE OUR FAITH VERSE 14
A MEDIATOR IS NOT A MEDIATOR OF ONE WE ARE THE OFFENDING PARTY
PAUL PROVED TO THEM THAT THEIR NEW DOCTRINE WAS NOT OF CHRIST BUT OF THE DEVIL
SO THAT YE CANNOT DO THE THINGS THAT YE WOULD
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT THAT CHRIST DIED FOR MY SINS
THE GLORY WHICH THE SECTARIANS SEEK IS QUITE UNSTABLE BECAUSE IT RESTS IN THE WHIM OF PEOPLE
VERSES 22 23 24
WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PROMISE IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE ABLE TO FULFILL THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD
TO PUT ON CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL MEANS TO CLOTHE ONESELF WITH THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WISDOM POWER LIFE AND SPIRIT OF CHRIST
CORNELIUS HAD THE FAITH OF THE FATHERS WHO WERE SAVED BY FAITH IN THE CHRIST TO COME
AND PROFITED IN THE JEWS RELIGION ABOVE MANY MY EQUALS IN MINE OWN NATION
SINCE THE DEVIL HAS THIS UNCANNY ABILITY TO MAKE US BELIEVE A LIE UNTIL WE WOULD SWEAR A THOUSAND TIMES IT WERE THE TRUTH WE MUST NOT BE PROUD BUT WALK IN FEAR AND HUMILITY AND CALL UPON THE LORD JESUS TO SAVE US FROM TEMPTATION
THE MORE YOU ENDEAVOR TO PERFORM THE LAW THE MORE YOU WILL BECOME TANGLED UP IN THE YOKE OF THE LAW THE TRUTH OF THIS I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MYSELF AND IN OTHERS
YOU CANNOT LAUGH AT GOD
SINCE CHRIST HAS COME WE CANNOT BE SAVED BY FAITH IN THE CHRIST TO COME BUT WE MUST BELIEVE THAT HE HAS COME
THESE FOES VANISH IN HIS PRESENCE
THAT WAS GREATLY TO THEIR HONOR
IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME IF CHRIST HAD NOT MERCIFULLY DELIVERED ME FROM THIS ERROR
BUT MY FLESH THE WORLD AND THE DEVIL INTERFERE WITH MY FAITH
NO WONDER OUR OPPONENTS THINK THEY ARE DOING GOD A FAVOR BY HATING AND PERSECUTING US
PETER EXCELLENT APOSTLE THAT HE WAS DENIED CHRIST
GOOD JUDGMENT GOOD GOVERNMENT AND PEACE
PAUL HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
WITH BARNABAS AND TOOK TITUS WITH ME ALSO
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HIS FAITH WAS INACTIVE
YOU SEE THEM SUCCUMB TO TEMPTATION YOU SEE THEM WEAK IN FAITH YOU SEE THEM GIVING WAY TO ANGER ENVY AND OTHER EVIL DISPOSITIONS
THE LAW IS SUCH A SCHOOLMASTER
OF THE WHICH I TELL YOU BEFORE AS I HAVE ALSO TOLD YOU IN THE PAST THAT THEY WHICH DO SUCH THINGS SHALL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD
TRAIN YOUR CONSCIENCE TO BELIEVE THAT GOD APPROVES OF YOU
TO DOUBT THE GOOD WILL OF GOD IS AN INBORN SUSPICION OF GOD WITH ALL OF US
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED THESE ARE UNCONDITIONAL PROMISES WHICH GOD FREELY MADE TO ABRAHAM WITHOUT RESPECT TO WORKS
THEY CIRCUMVENT THE PLAIN-SPOKEN STATEMENT OF THE APOSTLE BY SAYING THAT HE WAS SPEAKING FOR THE WICKED
BECAUSE THE LAW WAS GIVEN SO MANY YEARS AFTER ABRAHAM IT COULD NOT ABOLISH THE PROMISED BLESSING THIS ARGUMENT IS STRONG BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE EXACT FACTOR OF TIME
SUCH GIFTS AS WE POSSESS WE ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE GIFTS OF GOD GIVEN TO US FOR THE GOOD OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST
WE KNOW THAT
GOD DOES NOT LIKE DOUBT AND DEJECTION
LET US SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES WITH HUMILITY PRAYING THAT WE MAY NEVER LOSE THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL
THEREFORE HE TALKS OF CHRIST CONTINUALLY
ALL WHO GIVE THEIR FAITH TO THIS SON OF MINE TO THEM I AM GOD AND FATHER
WHENEVER SIN AND DEATH MAKE YOU NERVOUS WRITE IT DOWN AS AN ILLUSION OF THE DEVIL
IF ALL THE WORLD HAD STOOD AT THE MOUNTAIN ALL THE WORLD WOULD HAVE HATED THE LAW AND FLED FROM IT AS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID
WHEN THE LAW COMES TO PAY YOUR CONSCIENCE A VISIT SAY
ADMITTING THAT CHRIST HAD TWO NATURES AND THAT HE IS CALLED VERY GOD OF VERY GOD THEY WERE YET ABLE TO DENY HIS DIVINITY
THE FACT IS THE MORE A PERSON SEEKS CREDIT FOR HIMSELF BY HIS OWN EFFORTS THE DEEPER HE GOES INTO DEBT
NOT CIVIL LIBERTY FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE GOVERNMENT TO THANK BUT THE LIBERTY WHICH CHRIST HAS PROCURED FOR US
MOSES LED THE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR TENTS TO MEET GOD
LET HIM THAT IS TAUGHT IN THE WORD COMMUNICATE UNTO HIM THAT TEACHETH IN ALL GOOD THINGS
HOPE EXHORTS THE MIND TO BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS
SO ALSO IN EPHESIANS 1:3 WHO HATH BLESSED US WITH ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JERUSALEM HERE MEANS THE UNIVERSAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH ON EARTH
SATAN LOVES SUCH SAINTS
THEY WITNESSED HIS MIRACLES
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT GOD HAD WROUGHT MANY MIRACLES THROUGH ME
THE LAW OUGHT TO PREPARE THE WAY OF CHRIST INTO THE HEARTS OF MEN
ON THE OTHER HAND AMONG EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS THE WORD FAITH RELIGION SACRAMENTS SERVICE CHRIST GOD HEART AND MIND ARE COMMON TO ALL
ANOTHER IS MORE EASILY TEMPTED TO CARNAL LUST ANGER ENVY COVETOUSNESS
BY THE GOSPEL SHE PROCREATES AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE FREE HEIRS OF EVERLASTING LIFE
IN THY SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED WHEN CHRIST DIED THIS TESTAMENT WAS SEALED BY HIS BLOOD
IN THE BOOK ENTITLED THE LIVES OF OUR FATHERS ONE OF THE FATHERS IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID WHEN INFORMED THAT A BROTHER HAD FALLEN INTO ADULTERY
WHATEVER MERIT THE TRANSLATION NOW PRESENTED TO THE READER MAY POSSESS SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO THE CREDIT OF REV
MY GRACIOUS GOD WHO SHOWS MERCY UNTO WHOM HE WILL PARDONED ALL MINE INIQUITIES
BUT NO MATTER TO WHICH SINS WE ARE DISPOSED WE ARE TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT AND RESIST THE FLESH
I AM THE ONE FOR WHOSE SAKE YOU ARE KILLED
AS SOON AS THE TEACHER TURNS HIS BACK THE PUPIL BREAKS THE ROD AND THROWS IT INTO THE FIRE
HE IS EAGER TO MITIGATE HIS SHARP WORDS WITH GENTLE SENTIMENTS IN ORDER TO WIN THEM AGAIN
THE ARIANS WERE SHARP FELLOWS
WHEN THE CONSCIENCE IS DISTURBED DO NOT SEEK ADVICE FROM REASON OR FROM THE LAW BUT REST YOUR CONSCIENCE IN THE GRACE OF GOD AND IN HIS WORD AND PROCEED AS IF YOU HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE LAW
MAY WE ALL CLING TO THE WORD OF CHRIST AGAINST THE WILES OF THE DEVIL FOR WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES AGAINST POWERS AGAINST THE RULERS OF THE DARKNESS OF THIS WORLD AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH PLACES VERSE 7
HOW COULD YOU SO QUICKLY STRAY FROM GRACE INTO THE LAW FROM FREEDOM INTO BONDAGE THE EXAMPLE OF THE GALATIANS OF ANABAPTISTS AND OTHER SECTARIANS IN OUR DAY BEARS TESTIMONY TO THE EASE WITH WHICH FAITH MAY BE LOST
HE CANNOT SHAKE OFF AT WILL THE NIGHTMARE OF TERROR WHICH THE LAW STIRS UP IN HIS CONSCIENCE
THIS QUOTATION FROM MOSES DOES NOT APPLY TO CHRIST
HENCE WE ARE FORCED EITHER TO LOOK BEYOND THE LAW TO CHRIST OR WE GO THROUGH LIFE AS SHAMELESS HYPOCRITES AND SECURE SINNERS
ARISE SAID CHRIST TO PAUL AND GO INTO THE CITY AND IT SHALL BE TOLD THEE WHAT THOU MUST DO CHRIST DID NOT SEND PAUL INTO THE CITY TO LEARN THE GOSPEL FROM ANANIAS
MISTER LAW I DO NOT GET YOU
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE YOU
GENTLENESS IS AN EXCELLENT VIRTUE AND VERY USEFUL IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE
YOU WILL READILY GRANT THAT CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF FOR THE SINS OF PETER PAUL AND OTHERS WHO WERE WORTHY OF SUCH GRACE
CHRIST CANNOT BE PERCEIVED WITH THE SENSES
GOD FORBID THEY EXCLAIM PIOUSLY THAT I SHOULD EVER BE SO ARROGANT AS TO THINK THAT I STAND IN GRACE THAT I AM HOLY OR THAT I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST WE OUGHT TO FEEL SURE THAT WE STAND IN THE GRACE OF GOD NOT IN VIEW OF OUR OWN WORTHINESS BUT THROUGH THE GOOD SERVICES OF CHRIST
HE COMPARES THE CHRISTIAN LIFE TO A RACE
THEY TURN OUR ATTENTION FROM THE LAW TO THE PROMISES FROM SIN TO RIGHTEOUSNESS
PAUL CALLS THE GALATIANS FOOLISH AND BEWITCHED
THE REALIZATION OF SIN IN TURN FRIGHTENS THE HEART AND DRIVES IT TO DESPAIR
BUT HE NEVER BREATHED A WORD ABOUT THE LAW UNTIL FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AFTER
I THANK GOD THAT HE HAS PERMITTED ME TO SEE WHAT AS A MONK I SO EARNESTLY DESIRED TO SEE NOT ONE BUT MANY SAINTS WHOLE MULTITUDES OF TRUE SAINTS
HE THEREFORE CHANGES THE TONE OF HIS VOICE AND SPEAKS KINDLY TO THEM
THE PAPISTS INVENTED THEIR OWN DOCTRINE OF FAITH
I JUDGE NO MAN JOHN 8:15 AGAIN I CAME NOT TO JUDGE THE WORLD BUT TO SAVE THE WORLD JOHN 12:47 IN OTHER WORDS
YET UNDER THE CLOAK OF MY OUTWARD RESPECTABILITY I CONTINUALLY MISTRUSTED DOUBTED FEARED HATED AND BLASPHEMED GOD
WHAT A WONDERFUL GIFT HEAVEN IS MAN'S HEART CANNOT CONCEIVE MUCH LESS DESCRIBE
THAT THERE MIGHT BE IN THE WORLD A SPECIAL PEOPLE RIGIDLY CONTROLLED BY THE LAW A PEOPLE OUT OF WHICH CHRIST SHOULD BE BORN IN DUE TIME
THE FALSE APOSTLES ALSO HAD A GOSPEL BUT IT WAS AN UNTRUE GOSPEL
PETER'S WEAK ATTITUDE ENDANGERED THE PRINCIPLE OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY
ONCE THEY HAD FORSAKEN CHRIST ALTOGETHER THE APOSTLE WILL TRUST THE GALATIANS NO LONGER
FOR IF A MAN THINK HIMSELF TO BE SOMETHING WHEN HE IS NOTHING HE DECEIVETH HIMSELF
IF YOU COULD PROPERLY EVALUATE THIS INCOMPARABLE PRICE YOU WOULD THROW ALL YOUR CEREMONIES VOWS WORKS AND MERITS INTO THE ASH CAN
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING IF I WOULD URGE CIRCUMCISION AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW AS NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION
BUT BECAUSE I PREACH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH I MUST SUFFER PERSECUTION
FOR IF THEY WHICH ARE MADE OF THE LAW BE HEIRS FAITH IS MADE VOID AND THE PROMISE MADE OF NONE EFFECT IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE
BUT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE YEARS HER HOPE DIED OUT
UNLESS A SHARP DISTINCTION IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE CANNOT BE KEPT FREE FROM ERROR
AS LONG AS A PERSON IS IN THE WORLD HE CANNOT BY HIS OWN EFFORTS RID HIMSELF OF SIN BECAUSE THE WORLD IS BENT UPON EVIL
BRETHREN I BESEECH YOU...YE HAVE NOT INJURED ME AT ALL
PROPHETS HAVE ERRED
THEY ARE IMPORTANT
NO MAN OUGHT TO ALTER GOD'S TESTAMENT AS THE FALSE APOSTLES DO WHO SUBSTITUTE THE LAW AND TRADITIONS OF MEN FOR THE TESTAMENT OF GOD AS THE FALSE PROPHETS TAMPERED WITH GOD'S TESTAMENT IN THE DAYS OF PAUL SO MANY DO IN OUR DAY
BUT THE TYRANNY OF THE LAW IS NOT TO LAST FOREVER
THIS ASSURANCE TAKES IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT OUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
THE CONSULTATION HAD THE TWOFOLD MERIT OF DEFINITENESS AND BREVITY
PAUL HAS THEIR NUMBER WHEN HE CALLS THEM ZEROS
TRUE FOLLOWERS OF THE GOSPEL MUST NOT BE SHARP AND BITTER BUT GENTLE MILD COURTEOUS AND SOFT-SPOKEN WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO SEEK THEIR COMPANY
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU
THEY HAVE AN IDEA THAT THEIR CLOTHING THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THEIR CONDUCT ARE HOLY AND PLEASING TO CHRIST
NEITHER ARE WE SPEAKING OF CIVIL LIBERTY
WHAT GOOD ARE THE WORKS OF ALL MEN AND ALL THE PAINS OF THE MARTYRS IN COMPARISON WITH THE PAINS OF THE SON OF GOD DYING ON THE CROSS SO THAT THERE WAS NOT A DROP OF HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD BUT IT WAS ALL SHED FOR YOUR SINS
THIS IS THE BUSINESS OF THE LAW AND HERE THE BUSINESS OF THE LAW ENDS AND SHOULD GO NO FURTHER
LET EVERYBODY SERVE IN LOVE IT IS NOT AN EASY MATTER TO TEACH FAITH WITHOUT WORKS AND STILL TO REQUIRE WORKS
LET US COUNT THE PRICE
IF YOU DENY THAT HE IS A CONDEMNED SINNER YOU ARE FORCED TO DENY THAT CHRIST DIED
SIR DEVIL HE MAY SAY I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU
YOU WOULD CALL IT BEING CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND HELL-FIRE
HE BESTOWED HIS GRACE UPON ME AND CALLED ME FOR AN APOSTLE WE ALSO HAVE COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH BY THE SAME KINDNESS OF GOD
ACTS 16:20 21 ALL TROUBLES CALAMITIES FAMINES WARS WERE LAID TO THE CHARGE OF THE GOSPEL OF THE APOSTLES
TO LIVE UNTO THE LAW IS TO DIE UNTO GOD
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GOD IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS
FAITH ALONE JUSTIFIED WITHOUT WORKS
HE IS DEEPLY DISPLEASED WITH THEM FOR RELINQUISHING THEIR DIVINE DOCTRINE
IF ANYBODY EVER HAD REASON TO GLORY IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW IT WAS I I TOO MAY SAY THAT BEFORE I WAS ENLIGHTENED BY THE GOSPEL I WAS AS ZEALOUS FOR THE PAPISTICAL LAWS AND TRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS AS EVER A MAN WAS
I PAUL SAY TO YOU IF YOU SUBMIT TO CIRCUMCISION CHRIST WILL PROFIT YOU NOTHING PAUL EMPHATICALLY DECLARES THAT FOR THE GALATIANS TO BE CIRCUMCISED WOULD MEAN FOR THEM TO LOSE THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST'S SUFFERING AND DEATH
THEY ARE DANGEROUS THINGS
WITH PAUL WE DECRY THE BLINDNESS AND PERVERSENESS OF MEN IN THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE THE MESSAGE OF GRACE AND SALVATION OR HAVING RECEIVED IT THEY QUICKLY LET GO OF IT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GOSPEL BESTOWS ALL GOOD THINGS SPIRITUAL
IN CHRIST ALONE IS GOD WELL PLEASED
YOU CANNOT FIND A BETTER OR NEARER EXAMPLE THAN YOUR OWN
PERHAPS HE PREFERS HAGAR FOR THE HONOR ISHMAEL WAS THUS BORN WITHOUT A SPECIAL WORD OR PROMISE OF GOD AT THE MERE REQUEST OF SARAH
WE GLORY IN THE BELIEVING ABRAHAM OF WHOM THE SCRIPTURES SAY THAT HE RECEIVED THE BLESSING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR ALL WHO BELIEVE AS HE DID
IF HE IS DESPISED HE IS ALSO IN DANGER THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL SHOULD BE MEN WHO ARE NOT TOO EASILY AFFECTED BY PRAISE OR CRITICISM BUT SIMPLY SPEAK OUT THE BENEFIT AND THE GLORY OF CHRIST AND SEEK THE SALVATION OF SOULS
BUT WHERE WILL YOU FIND THE PERSON WHO CAN DO THAT
THEY DID NOT OVERCOME HIM HE OVERCAME THEM
IT IS HARD FOR A MAN TO DEFEND HIS CAUSE AT A DISTANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS REASON TO THINK THAT HE PERSONALLY HAS FALLEN INTO DISFAVOR
I AM A SINNER I AM NOT A SINNER
THEY REST IN HIS GOODNESS AND MERCY
AND IT IS A GOOD THING
YE KNOW HOW THROUGH INFIRMITY OF THE FLESH I PREACHED THE GOSPEL UNTO YOU AT THE FIRST
HE INCREASES STRENGTHENS AND CONFIRMS FAITH IN US THROUGH HIS WORD
A TEACHER CHASTISES THE PUPIL TO REFORM HIM
THE LEAVINGS OF OLD VICES WILL STICK TO HIM BE HE EVER SO GOOD A CHRISTIAN
A HOLY LIFE IS TO BE BAPTIZED AND TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST AND TO SUBDUE THE FLESH WITH THE SPIRIT
CHRISTIAN FAITH IS NOT AN INACTIVE QUALITY IN THE HEART
WON'T YOU VERSE 18
CHRIST ACCORDING TO PAUL WAS NOT AN AGENT OF THE LAW BUT A PATIENT OF THE LAW
WHAT I CONDEMN IS THAT MEN SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW AS IF CHRIST WERE STILL TO COME OR AS IF HE ALONE WERE UNABLE TO JUSTIFY SINNERS
THERE CAN BE NO PEACE WITHOUT LONGSUFFERING AND THEREFORE PAUL LISTS THIS VIRTUE NEXT
IT IS SAFER TO ATTRIBUTE TOO MUCH GLORY UNTO GOD THAN UNTO MAN
IT IS TO LAST ONLY UNTIL THE TIME APPOINTED OF THE FATHER VERSE 3
LET US ABOUND IN SIN THAT GRACE MAY ABOUND
PAUL CAN ALWAYS BE DEPENDED ON TO ADD THE CONDITIONAL CLAUSE IN CHRIST JESUS IF WE LOSE SIGHT OF CHRIST WE LOSE OUT
TO BECOME A BLESSING UNTO ALL NATIONS CHRIST HAD TO BE MADE A CURSE TO TAKE AWAY THE CURSE FROM THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH
WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TO DO THE WORKS OF THE LAW DOES NOT MEAN ONLY TO LIVE UP TO THE SUPERFICIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW BUT TO OBEY THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW TO PERFECTION
WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS FOR RECENT CONVERTS FROM JUDAISM SUDDENLY TO BREAK WITH THE LAW
ON THE CONTRARY THEY ABOLISH THE GOSPEL THEY DERIDE DENY AND BLASPHEME CHRIST AND CALL UPON THEMSELVES THE WRATH OF GOD
WHATEVER SINS I YOU ALL OF US HAVE COMMITTED OR SHALL COMMIT THEY ARE CHRIST'S SINS AS IF HE HAD COMMITTED THEM HIMSELF
WHAT MAKES MATTERS WORSE IS THAT ONE-HALF OF OURSELVES OUR OWN REASON STANDS AGAINST US
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST A MAN WILL ALWAYS ARGUE THAT THE LAW IS NECESSARY FOR SALVATION THAT IT WILL STRENGTHEN THE WEAK AND ENRICH THE POOR
SERVE ONE ANOTHER IN LOVE
SINCE YOU HAVE FOUND CHRIST BY FAITH WE SAY BEGIN NOW TO WORK AND DO WELL
THEY MURMURED
THE READER IS REMINDED THAT ALL THIS HAS NO BEARING UPON CIVIL LAWS CUSTOMS OR POLITICAL MATTERS
BUT THAT DOES NOT BOTHER ME
NOT MOSES BUT THE SON OF GOD
WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM IS SAVED SHALL NOT PERISH SHALL HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE IS NOT JUDGED ETC
THE PERSON WHO IS NOT MOVED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS TO LEAVE THE LAW AND THE CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THE LIBERTY IN CHRIST HAS A HEART THAT IS HARDER THAN STONE AND IRON
YOU KNOW FROM THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM AND FROM THE PLAIN TESTIMONY OF THE SCRIPTURES THAT THEY ARE THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM WHO HAVE FAITH IN CHRIST REGARDLESS OF THEIR NATIONALITY REGARDLESS OF THE LAW REGARDLESS OF WORKS REGARDLESS OF THEIR PARENTAGE
WE ARE ALL EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEVIL BECAUSE HE IS THE PRINCE AND GOD OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE
FAITH IS NO GOOD UNLESS IT IS REINFORCED BY WORKS
THE LITTLE LIGHT OF FAITH IN MY HEART DOES NOT SHINE ALL OVER ME AT ONCE
SUCH A CREATURE CANNOT BE BROUGHT INTO LIFE BY GOOD WORKS BUT BY CHRIST ALONE
I HAVE GOOD REASON FOR ENLARGING UPON THIS POINT
THEY CRUCIFY THE FLESH WITH ITS EVIL DESIRES AND LUSTS
THE POPE AND HIS BISHOPS INSPIRED BY THE DESIRE TO LORD IT OVER MEN'S SOULS CRACK OUT THUNDERS AND CURSES UPON MISERABLE CONSCIENCES
BUT HE IS NOT SURE WHETHER THE GALATIANS HAVE FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GOSPEL AND THE LAW
IF THAT IS A SAMPLE OF THEIR VAUNTED CHARITY WE WANT NONE OF IT
IT IS WORTH BEING CALLED BLESSED
BUT BECAUSE SIN CONTINUES TO DWELL IN THE FLESH THE LAW WAITS AROUND TO MOLEST OUR CONSCIENCE
IT IS NOT TO TORMENT US ALWAYS
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GOD IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS CRIES PAUL
WELL THEN IT IS CERTAIN GOD DID NOT CALL ME ON ACCOUNT OF MY BLASPHEMIES PERSECUTIONS OPPRESSIONS
THEREFORE THE APOSTLE ESTABLISHES THIS RULE OF LOVE FOR THE BELIEVERS
PAUL UNDERTAKES TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH
IT IS A GRADUAL DIFFUSION
IF SIN IS TAKEN AWAY THE WRATH OF GOD AND HIS CONDEMNATION ARE ALSO TAKEN AWAY
THE SPIRIT OF GOD OUTCRIES THEM ALL
IF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW WERE NECESSARY UNTO SALVATION THE HOLY GHOST WOULD NEVER HAVE COME TO THE GENTILES BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BOTHER ABOUT THE LAW
HEIRS DO NOT LOOK FOR LAWS AND ASSESSMENTS WHEN THEY OPEN A LAST WILL
IN THE EARLY CHURCH THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS SENT FORTH IN VISIBLE FORM
THEY KNOW BETTER THAN TO TRUST IN THEIR OWN WORKS
I MAY FALL INTO WORSE SIN
TELL ME YE THAT DESIRE TO BE UNDER THE LAW DO YE NOT HEAR THE LAW
WE RATHER THROUGH THE SPIRIT WAIT FOR THE HOPE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THE APOSTLE IS NOT SATISFIED TO SAY JUSTIFIED BY FAITH HE ADDS HOPE TO FAITH

YE DID RUN WELL
BUT THE TRUTH WILL WIN OUT
I WANT YOU TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER
PAUL FIRST HYPOTHETICALLY CURSES HIMSELF
WE DO NOT SPREAD WICKED LIES
IN YOUR OWN CASE YOU HAVE NOT ONLY LEARNED THE LAW BY HEART YOU HAVE LABORED WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT TO PERFORM IT
BUT WHERE THE EARTHLY THING IS AN ORDINANCE OF GOD WE MAY USE IT TO PROVE DIVINE MATTERS
HE MUST BE SURE THAT HE IS PROPERLY CALLED
THEY DECLARE THAT THE SON OF GOD DID NOT ONLY FULFILL ONE OR TWO EASY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW BUT THAT HE ENDURED ALL THE TORTURES OF THE LAW
THIS PASSAGE FURTHERMORE DECLARES THAT CHRIST'S PURPOSE IN COMING WAS THE ABOLITION OF THE LAW NOT WITH THE INTENTION OF LAYING DOWN NEW LAWS BUT TO REDEEM THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW CHRIST HIMSELF DECLARED
THEY ALSO FORESAW THE DISSENSIONS THAT WOULD CREEP INTO THE CHURCH
I SHALL TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF TEACHERS YOU HAVE NOW
IF IT THRUSTS ITS NOSE INTO THE BUSINESS OF JUSTIFICATION WE MUST TALK HARSHLY TO THE LAW TO KEEP IT IN ITS PLACE
WHEREFORE THOU ART NO MORE A SERVANT BUT A SON
BUT OUR OPPONENTS WELL-FED IDLERS THAT THEY ARE WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE ENDURED
GOD DID WELL IN GIVING THE PROMISE SO MANY YEARS BEFORE THE LAW THAT IT MAY NEVER BE SAID THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS GRANTED THROUGH THE LAW AND NOT THROUGH THE PROMISE
WE COUNTED THEM AS OUR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN AND WERE HAPPY TO THINK THAT THEY WOULD HELP US IN SOWING THE SEED OF THE GOSPEL
THE OBJECTION IS FREQUENTLY RAISED THAT THE BIBLE COMMANDS THAT WE SHOULD LOVE GOD WITH ALL OUR HEART
BUT THE PAPISTS OMIT FAITH ALTOGETHER AND TEACH SELF-DEVISED TRADITIONS AND WORKS THAT ARE NOT COMMANDED OF GOD INDEED ARE CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD AND FOR THESE TRADITIONS THEY DEMAND PREFERRED ATTENTION AND OBEDIENCE
AND SO IT IS
EVEN THESE WILL BE CAST OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN OF THE BONDWOMAN
THE TRUTH IS I AM ALL SIN
WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF THE LAW MY GALATIANS WHEN THE LAW CAME FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE PROMISE THE FALSE APOSTLES GLORIFIED THE LAW AND DESPISED THE PROMISE MADE UNTO ABRAHAM ALTHOUGH IT ANTEDATED THE LAW BY MANY YEARS
AND WE NEED A BETTER MEDIATOR THAN MOSES
TO KEEP THE LAW IN ORDER TO BE JUSTIFIED MEANS TO REJECT GRACE TO DENY CHRIST TO DESPISE HIS SACRIFICE AND TO BE LOST
PAUL SIMPLY FOLLOWS THE CUSTOM OF THE JEWS WHO INCLUDED THE FIRST BOOK OF MOSES IN THE COLLECTIVE TERM LAW JESUS EVEN INCLUDED THE PSALMS
BRETHREN IF A MAN BE OVERTAKEN IN A FAULT YE WHICH ARE SPIRITUAL RESTORE SUCH AN ONE IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS
BRETHREN IF A MAN BE OVERTAKEN IN A FAULT YE WHICH ARE SPIRITUAL RESTORE SUCH AN ONE IN THE SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS
OUR WAY OF WRITING IS INCISIVE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD
PAUL WANTS THE GALATIANS TO JUDGE HIS WORDS ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION THAT MADE THEM NECESSARY
IT CONTAINED PROMISES OF GREAT SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS
IN THIS LIFE WE CAN HAVE ONLY THE FIRST-FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT AS PAUL SAYS
HE WAS NEVER CIRCUMCISED
SINCE THE DEVIL LIES IN AMBUSH FOR THOSE IN PARTICULAR WHO HATE THE WORLD AND SEEKS TO DEPRIVE US OF OUR LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT OR TO BRUTALIZE IT INTO THE LIBERTY OF THE FLESH WE PLEAD WITH OUR BRETHREN AFTER THE MANNER OF PAUL THAT THEY MAY NEVER USE THIS LIBERTY OF THE SPIRIT PURCHASED FOR US BY CHRIST AS AN EXCUSE FOR CARNAL LIVING OR AS PETER EXPRESSES IT I PETER 2:16 FOR A CLOAK OF MALICIOUSNESS IN ORDER THAT CHRISTIANS MAY NOT ABUSE THEIR LIBERTY THE APOSTLE ENCUMBERS THEM WITH THE RULE OF MUTUAL LOVE THAT THEY SHOULD SERVE EACH OTHER IN LOVE
VERSE 22
VERSE 22
ONLY LEST THEY SHOULD SUFFER PERSECUTION FOR THE CROSS OF CHRIST
BY LOVE SERVE ONE ANOTHER
OUR CONSCIENCE MUST BE TRAINED TO FALL BACK ON THE FREEDOM PURCHASED FOR US BY CHRIST
WILL YOU DO IT I WILL ON ONE CONDITION AND WHAT IS THAT THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK--BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS I ILLUSTRATED THE POINT BY READING TO MR ZONDERVAN A FEW SENTENCES FROM AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION LATELY REPRINTED BY AN AMERICAN PUBLISHER OF ONE OF LUTHER'S OUTSTANDING REFORMATORY ESSAYS
BUT CHRIST HAS IMMORTAL LIFE AND LIFE IMMORTAL GAINED THE VICTORY OVER DEATH
EVEN IN THESE WORDS THE APOSTLE DENIES THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR KNOWING GOD BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAW
IN SPIRITUAL MATTERS A PERSON IS BY NATURE FULL OF DARKNESS ERROR IGNORANCE MALICE AND PERVERSENESS IN WILL AND IN MIND
TILL THE SEED SHOULD COME TO WHOM THE PROMISE WAS MADE THAT MAY BE TAKEN LITERALLY TO MEAN UNTIL THE TIME OF THE GOSPEL
17:4 YOU CANNOT EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE
AND I BRETHREN IF I YET PREACH CIRCUMCISION WHY DO I YET SUFFER PERSECUTION
HOW IS GOD GOING TO HUMBLE SUCH A PERSON EXCEPT BY THE LAW
IF YOU WERE YOU WOULD KNOW AND LOVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD IS AN ENEMY OF THE LAW
THEY ADMIT THAT FAITH IS THE FOUNDATION OF SALVATION
AS A GENTILE HE WAS UNCIRCUMCISED
NOR IS CHRIST THE END OF THE LAW IN A WAY THAT MAKES HIM A HARD JUDGE WHO HAS TO BE BRIBED BY WORKS AS THE PAPISTS TEACH
WE COMFORT THE AFFLICTED SINNER IN THIS MANNER
IT SAYS
NOTE HOW PAUL EXPLAINS CHRIST
I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
THAT IS THE PRAISE AND GLORY OF HIS MERCY
THOSE WHO ARE CHRIST'S OWN CRUCIFY THEIR FLESH
I AM THY SHIELD ETC
LET THE JEWS GLORY IN THE GENERATING ABRAHAM
THE APOSTLE DOES NOT SPEAK OF THE WORKS OF THE SPIRIT AS HE SPOKE OF THE WORKS OF THE FLESH BUT HE ATTACHES TO THESE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES A BETTER NAME
I DO NOT FRUSTRATE THE GRACE OF GOD
REPROVE REBUKE EXHORT IN THE MIDST OF HIS DISCOURSE ON CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS PAUL BREAKS OFF AND TURNS TO ADDRESS THE GALATIANS
THIS CIVIL RESTRAINT BY THE LAW IS INTENDED BY GOD FOR THE PRESERVATION OF ALL THINGS PARTICULARLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE GOSPEL THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE HINDERED TOO MUCH BY THE TUMULT OF THE WICKED
THAT IS WHY PAUL CAN GET SO ANGRY AT THE ANTICHRIST BECAUSE HE SNUBS CHRIST REBUFFS THE GRACE OF GOD AND REFUSES THE MERIT OF CHRIST
TO BE AT PEACE WITH GOD WE HAVE NEED OF A FAR BETTER MEDIATOR THAN MOSES OR THE LAW
BUT MERE IMITATION WILL NOT SATISFY GOD
THE LAW TERRORIZES THE CONSCIENCE
WITH MOTHERLY AFFECTION HE TALKS TO THEM YET HE DOES IT IN A WAY THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE ALSO REPROVES THEM
CAN YOU SEE NOTHING BUT LAW SIN DEATH AND HELL
IF HE SAYS THOU SHALT BE DAMNED YOU TELL HIM
THAT THE MINISTERS OF THE CHURCH NEED SUPPORT ANY MAN WITH COMMON SENSE CAN SEE
FAITH SAYS TO GOD
I DON'T CARE IF CYPRIAN AMBROSE AUGUSTINE PETER PAUL JOHN OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN TEACHES SO AND SO
THE ROD HURTS BUT CORRECTION IS NECESSARY
CHRIST IS THE END OR FINISH OF THE LAW TO ALL WHO BELIEVE IN HIM
BUT IF CHRIST IS INNOCENT OF OUR SINS AND DOES NOT BEAR THEM WE MUST BEAR THEM AND WE SHALL DIE IN OUR SINS
THIS IS TO SIN
HE DOES NOT TRAMPLE THE FALLEN BUT RAISES THEM
PAUL DOES NOT ONLY REFER TO THE CEREMONIAL LAW BUT TO THE WHOLE LAW
THEY CONFESS CHRIST WITH THEIR LIPS AND AT THE SAME TIME DENY HIS POWER TO SAVE
THE EMPHASIS LIES ON THE WORDS WITH FAITHFUL ABRAHAM PAUL DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN ABRAHAM AND ABRAHAM
TRUE ENOUGH
THEIRS IS A DOUBLE MISFORTUNE
DID NOT THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM FOLLOW ON THE HEELS OF THE GOSPEL
THAT BOOK WAS WRITTEN FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF VERIFYING PAUL'S ASSERTION THAT THE HOLY GHOST COMES UPON MEN NOT IN RESPONSE TO THE PREACHING OF THE LAW BUT IN RESPONSE TO THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
STILL THERE IS NO SIN MORE COMMON
IT MAY BE THAT THE SIMILARITY OF THESE TWO NAMES GAVE PAUL HIS IDEA FOR THIS ALLEGORY
BECAUSE OF MY FAITH IN CHRIST GOD OVERLOOKS MY DISTRUST THE UNWILLINGNESS OF MY SPIRIT MY MANY OTHER SINS
THE LAW IS AN USHER TO LEAD THE WAY TO GRACE
SPEAKING OF MONEY NOBODY WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE NOWADAYS TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE MINISTRY AND THE ERECTION OF SCHOOLS
DO NOT LET THE FACT DISTURB YOU THAT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE ENJOY EXCELLENT REPUTATIONS WITHOUT CHRIST
WE WHO ARE JEWS BY NATURE AND NOT SINNERS OF THE GENTILES
HE QUESTIONS THEIR MOTIVES
TO TURN ONE'S EYES AWAY FROM JESUS MEANS TO TURN THEM TO THE LAW
BY FAITH CHRIST CHANGES PLACES WITH US
TITUS WAS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CHURCHES IN CRETE HAVING BEEN PLACED IN CHARGE OF THE CHURCHES BY PAUL
HOW CAN THESE TWO CONTRADICTIONS BE HARMONIZED
THE JEWS REGARDED THE CONDITIONAL PROMISES OF THE LAW AS IF THEY WERE UNCONDITIONAL
WAS HIS DEATH WORTH WHILE OR WAS IT NOT
THEY COULD NOT THINK OF ANY OTHER GOOD WORKS
IF THEY WOULD ONLY PERMIT US TO KEEP OUR DOCTRINE OF FAITH
THEREFORE THE APOSTLE DOES NOT ONLY ADMONISH US TO DO GOOD BUT TO DO GOOD UNTIRINGLY
EITHER WE ARE JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST OR WE ARE MADE WORSE SINNERS BY HIM THE SACRED SCRIPTURES PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MAKE FREQUENT MENTION OF FAITH IN CHRIST
SECONDLY THEY ARE VERY SLY AND WILY IN SUGGESTING THAT THE MINISTRY OF OTHER PASTORS IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE
HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BECOME YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND YOUR SINS WILL BECOME HIS SINS
HOW THEN CAN ANYONE BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW WHEN EVERYBODY HATES THE LAW AND ITS DIVINE AUTHOR
FOR IT IS WRITTEN REJOICE THOU BARREN THAT BEAREST NOT
I APPROVE THE SCRIPTURES
WITH THIS TEACHING THEY TORMENTED MEN'S CONSCIENCES EXCOMMUNICATED CHRIST FROM THE CHURCH AND LIMITED THE OPERATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST
HERE HE LETS LOVE STAND BY ITSELF AMONG OTHER FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT TO REMIND THE CHRISTIANS TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER IN HONOR PREFERRING ONE ANOTHER TO ESTEEM OTHERS MORE THAN THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE CHRIST AND THE HOLY GHOST WITHIN THEM
THE TWO WOMEN REPRESENT THE TWO TESTAMENTS
THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ARE THE SLAVES OF THE DEVIL
THE DOCTRINE OF THE GOSPEL WE ARE TOLD IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE PRESENT UNREST IN THE WORLD
0 FOOLISH GALATIANS
IT DECLARES THAT WE ARE JUSTIFIED NOT BY WORKS SACRIFICES OR CEREMONIES BUT BY CHRIST ALONE
AGAINST THESE SINS THEY NEVER FOUGHT BECAUSE THEY NEVER TOOK THEM FOR SINS
AS OFTEN AS I READ THE ADMONITIONS OF THE APOSTLE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CHURCHES SHOULD SUPPORT THEIR PASTORS AND RAISE FUNDS FOR THE RELIEF OF IMPOVERISHED CHRISTIANS I AM HALF ASHAMED TO THINK THAT THE GREAT APOSTLE PAUL HAD TO TOUCH UPON THIS SUBJECT SO FREQUENTLY
SUCH IS THE ILL EFFECT OF VAINGLORY
THERE IS NO SIN WHICH PAUL AND THE OTHER APOSTLES DETESTED MORE THAN WHEN A PERSON DESPISES THE GRACE OF GOD IN CHRIST JESUS
PAUL DEFENDED HIS ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT HE HAD CIRCUMCISED TIMOTHY NOT FROM COMPULSION BUT FROM CHRISTIAN LOVE LEST THE WEAK IN FAITH SHOULD BE OFFENDED
ONLY CHRISTIANS POSSESS THIS VICTORIOUS KNOWLEDGE GIVEN FROM ABOVE
THIS WOULD BE THE CASE IF WE WERE TO PREACH WHAT THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD AND HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO HEAR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS
AGAIN AND IN THEE SHALL ALL FAMILIES OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED TO PREVENT THE JEWS FROM MISINTERPRETING THE WORD NATIONS THE SCRIPTURES ARE CAREFUL TO SAY MANY NATIONS THE TRUE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM ARE THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST FROM ALL NATIONS
FOR GOD REQUIRES ABOVE ALL THAT WE WORSHIP HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN FAITH
THAT CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WOMB OF THE VIRGIN MARY ETC
THE LAW REVEALS GUILT FILLS THE CONSCIENCE WITH TERROR AND DRIVES MEN TO DESPAIR
ADULTERY FORNICATION UNCLEANNESS LASCIVIOUSNESS IDOLATRY WITCHCRAFT
I AM AFRAID OF YOU LEST I HAVE BESTOWED UPON YOU LABOR IN VAIN
PAUL ARGUES
WHAT IS THE WORLD TO HIM WHO HAS HEAVEN
IN THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER OF EXODUS THE LORD ADDRESSES MOSES AT THE RED SEA
TO BE DEAD TO THE LAW MEANS TO BE FREE OF THE LAW
THE LAW IS MEANT TO PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT TODAY WHICH IT PRODUCED AT MOUNT SINAI LONG AGO
NO GOOD AT ALL
I WILL GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION FROM THE CUSTOMS OF MEN
HE HAS LICKED YOU AND HOLDS YOU DOWN
TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TAUGHT THE WORD OF GOD AND ADMINISTERED THE SACRAMENTS RIGHTLY IS TO HAVE A GLORY THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY
THE PROMISE YOU WILL RECALL IS THE INHERITANCE ITSELF OR THE BLESSING PROMISED TO ABRAHAM DELIVERANCE FROM THE LAW SIN DEATH AND THE DEVIL AND THE FREE GIFT OF GRACE RIGHTEOUSNESS SALVATION AND ETERNAL LIFE
BUT OF THOSE WHO SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT WHATSOEVER THEY WERE IT MAKETH NO MATTER TO ME
IT DOES NO GOOD TO SAY THAT ONLY CIRCUMCISION IS NECESSARY AND NOT THE REST OF MOSES LAWS
WHETHER A PERSON IS A JEW A PUNCTILIOUS AND CIRCUMCISED OBSERVER OF THE LAW OF MOSES OR WHETHER A PERSON IS A NOBLE AND WISE GREEK DOES NOT MATTER
SEDUCED INTO ERROR BY THE FALSE APOSTLES THE GALATIANS REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE ST PAUL AS THEIR PASTOR
NOT BECAUSE HE LEFT HIS COUNTRY HIS RELATIVES HIS FATHER'S HOUSE
SIN IS NOT CANCELED BY LAWFUL LIVING FOR NO PERSON IS ABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE LAW
TO IT I AM AS IT WERE IN WEDLOCK
THE LEAST LITTLE POINT OF DOCTRINE IS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN HEAVEN AND EARTH
NO FATHER WANTS HIS SON TO BE WHIPPED ALL THE TIME
WHEREVER HE PREACHED THE GOSPEL JEWS AND GENTILES RAVED AGAINST HIM
THE LAW REVEALS THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD
SARAH REPRESENTS THAT SPIRITUAL JERUSALEM WHERE THERE IS NO LAW BUT ONLY THE PROMISE AND WHERE THE INHABITANTS ARE FREE
BUT WE CAN GLORY IN THE LORD AND ATTEND TO OUR WORK CHEERFULLY
I HAD SHED INNOCENT BLOOD
OUR SINS HAVE TO BE CHRIST'S SINS OR WE SHALL PERISH FOREVER
AND THEY THAT ARE CHRIST'S HAVE CRUCIFIED THE FLESH WITH THE AFFECTIONS AND LUSTS
VICE VERSA TO DIE UNTO THE LAW IS TO LIVE UNTO GOD
AND THESE ARE CONTRARY THE ONE TO THE OTHER
GERHARDT MAHLER OF GENEVA N.Y WHO CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE IN A VERY BUSY SEASON BY MAKING A ROUGH DRAFT OF THE TRANSLATION AND LATER PREPARING A REVISION OF IT WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE FINAL DRAFT SUBMITTED TO THE PRINTER
IN THE LAST ANALYSIS SUCH RESTRAINT IS SIMPLE HYPOCRISY
WHEN WE DISCUSS JUSTIFICATION WE OUGHT TO SPEAK OF CHRIST AND THE BENEFITS HE HAS BROUGHT US
NO SATAN YOU CANNOT DELUDE ME INTO THINKING I AM HOLY
I CONFESS I HAVE SINNED THEN GOD WILL PUNISH YOU NO HE WILL NOT DO THAT WHY NOT
OF CHRIST THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHET COMPLAINED
HE SAYS TO THE GALATIANS
WHO IS THIS ME
GREAT DISSENSION FOLLOWED
PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ETC PAUL LOSES NO TIME IN DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE CHARGE THAT HE HAD THRUST HIMSELF INTO THE MINISTRY
ALL NATIONS ARE TO BE DECLARED RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
AND PAUL DOES NOT NEGLECT TO PRAISE THEM FOR IT
MADE UNDER THE LAW TO REDEEM THEM THAT WERE UNDER THE LAW PAUL CALLS THE VIRGIN MARY A WOMAN
HE OPPOSES THOSE WHO THINK THEY CAN FULFILL THE LAW WHEN IN REALITY THEY CAN ONLY SIN AGAINST THE LAW BY TRYING TO OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY THE LAW
BUT WHEN HE HEARD THE OMINOUS WORDS WHAT HAST THOU DONE
3:16 WHEN WE HAVE A LOVE FOR THE WORD OF GOD AND GLADLY HEAR TALK WRITE AND THINK OF CHRIST WE ARE TO KNOW THAT THIS INCLINATION TOWARD CHRIST IS THE GIFT AND WORK OF THE HOLY GHOST
IF WE DO NOT LOVE GOD AND HIS WORD WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF WE LOVE ANYTHING AT ALL
THE JEWS WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS INTERPRETATION
LUTHER'S COMMENTARY FILLS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE OCTAVO PAGES IN THE WEIDMAN EDITION OF HIS WORKS
BUT HE SAYS PAUL THAT SEARCHETH THE HEARTS KNOWETH WHAT IS THE MIND OF THE SPIRIT ROMANS 8:27 TO THIS SEARCHER OF HEARTS OUR FEEBLE GROANING AS IT SEEMS TO US IS A LOUD SHOUT FOR HELP IN COMPARISON WITH WHICH THE HOWLS OF HELL THE DIN OF THE DEVIL THE YELLS OF THE LAW THE SHOUTS OF SIN ARE LIKE SO MANY WHISPERS
PAUL TAUGHT JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS WITHOUT THE DEEDS OF THE LAW
THE PROMISE IS THEREFORE BETTER THAN THE LAW
THE FALSE APOSTLES COMPEL YOU TO CUT OFF THE FORESKIN OF YOUR FLESH
THE JEWS EXHIBITED A WORKING ABRAHAM
THE GOSPEL HOWEVER BRINGS ON THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE IT IS THE NATURE OF THE GOSPEL TO CONVEY GOOD GIFTS
BUT THE SCRIPTURE HATH CONCLUDED ALL UNDER SIN
WHOEVER GIVES UP THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION DOES NOT KNOW THE TRUE GOD
WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THIS--AND YOU SHOULD BECAUSE WHAT HAST THOU THAT THOU DIDST NOT RECEIVE?"--YOU WILL NOT FLATTER YOURSELF ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WILL NOT CARRY YOURSELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF RESIGNING FROM THE MINISTRY WHEN YOU ARE INSULTED REPROACHED OR PERSECUTED
I THROUGH LIBERTY AM DEAD TO THE LAW BY PUTTING IT IN THIS WAY I THROUGH THE LAW AM DEAD TO THE LAW HE OPPOSES ONE LAW WITH ANOTHER LAW AND HAS THEM FIGHT IT OUT
IT MAKES YOU VOID OF CHRIST SO THAT CHRIST IS NOT IN YOU NOR CAN YOU BE PARTAKERS OF THE KNOWLEDGE THE SPIRIT THE FELLOWSHIP THE LIBERTY THE LIFE OR THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHRIST
NEITHER BY WORD NOR DEED DID HE EVER INVEIGH AGAINST CIRCUMCISION
IN CHRIST WE PERCEIVE THAT GOD IS NOT A CRUEL JUDGE BUT A MOST LOVING AND MERCIFUL FATHER WHO TO BLESS AND TO SAVE US SPARED NOT HIS OWN SON BUT GAVE HIM UP FOR US ALL THIS IS TRULY TO KNOW GOD
YOU DO NOT WORK HARD
NONE OF THESE PREROGATIVES SPELL FAITH IN CHRIST WHICH ALONE CAN JUSTIFY A PERSON
GOD WILL AND CAN BE KNOWN IN NO OTHER WAY THAN IN AND THROUGH CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT OF JOHN 1:18 THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON WHICH IS IN THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER HE HATH DECLARED HIM CHRIST IS THE ONLY MEANS WHEREBY WE CAN KNOW GOD AND HIS WILL
WHEN YOU SEE A PERSON SQUIRMING IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE LAW SAY TO HIM
THEY SAY IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE WOULD MAKE SOME SLIGHT CONCESSION RATHER THAN CAUSE SUCH COMMOTION AND CONTROVERSY IN THE CHURCH REGARDING AN ARTICLE WHICH IS NOT EVEN ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES
WHEN HE SAW THAT SOME WERE OFFENDED AT HIS DOCTRINE WHILE OTHERS FOUND IN IT ENCOURAGEMENT TO LIVE AFTER THE FLESH PAUL COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE ELECT OF GOD AND THAT FOR THEIR SAKE HE MUST ENDURE ALL THINGS
A GERMAN TRANSLATION BY JUSTUS MENIUS APPEARED IN THE WITTENBERG EDITION OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS PUBLISHED IN 1539
ABRAHAM WAS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE HE BELIEVED
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE WHEN WE ARE DEAD AND GONE
BUT THE GALATIANS DID NOT MIND IT
ON ACCOUNT OF MY OUTRAGEOUS CRUELTY
I TRIED TO QUIET MY CONSCIENCE IN MANY WAYS BUT IT DID NOT WORK BECAUSE LUST WOULD ALWAYS COME BACK AND GIVE ME NO REST
WE ARE NO BETTER THAN THE APOSTLES WHO HAD TO WITNESS THE SUBVERSION OF THE CHURCHES WHICH THEY HAD PLANTED WITH THEIR OWN HANDS
THE WORST THEY CAN SAY ABOUT US IS THAT WE HAVE THE GOSPEL
NOT THE WORLD BUT CHRIST IS CRUCIFIED IN THE MONASTERIES
BRETHREN YE HAVE BEEN CALLED UNTO LIBERTY IN ORDER THAT NOBODY MIGHT MISTAKE THE LIBERTY OF WHICH HE SPEAKS FOR THE LIBERTY OF THE FLESH THE APOSTLE ADDS THE EXPLANATORY NOTE ONLY USE NOT LIBERTY FOR AN OCCASION TO THE FLESH BUT BY LOVE SERVE ONE ANOTHER PAUL NOW EXPLAINS AT THE HAND OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WHAT IT MEANS TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER IN LOVE
THE DEVIL ACCUSED HIM
HE HAD CALLED THEM FOOLS CRUCIFIERS OF CHRIST ETC
ALL MERIT-SEEKERS TAKE CHRIST FOR A NEW LAWGIVER
BEFORE HIS CONVERSION HIS TONGUE UTTERED BLASPHEMIES
BUT THEIR UNIONISTIC DREAMS CANNOT BE REALIZED WITHOUT LOSS TO THE PURE DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS
HE THAT SOWETH TO THE FLESH I.E HE THAT HAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THE MINISTERS OF GOD BUT ONLY THINKS OF HIMSELF THAT PERSON WILL REAP OF THE FLESH CORRUPTION NOT ONLY IN THIS LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE LIFE TO COME
CORNELIUS AND HIS FRIENDS WHOM HE HAD INVITED OVER TO HIS HOUSE DO NOTHING BUT SIT AND LISTEN
THE PAPACY IS FOUNDED UPON HALLUCINATIONS
NO PERSON HAS EVER SUNK SO LOW THAT HE CANNOT RISE AGAIN
IN OTHER WORDS GOD GRANTED UNTO ABRAHAM REMISSION OF SINS RIGHTEOUSNESS SALVATION AND EVERLASTING LIFE
THEY SHOULD NOT BE ADULTERERS FORNICATORS OR SENSUALISTS
ACCORDINGLY EACH CHRISTIAN CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE IN HIS HEART TIMES OF THE LAW AND TIMES OF THE GOSPEL
WHEN THEY ARE PUT TO THE TEST ALL THEIR SELF-CONFIDENCE SLIPS FROM THEM
NOW IF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MORAL LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY HOW CAN CIRCUMCISION JUSTIFY WHEN CIRCUMCISION IS PART OF THE CEREMONIAL LAW
JOHN THE BAPTIST CALLED HIM THE LAMB OF GOD WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD BEING THE UNSPOTTED LAMB OF GOD CHRIST WAS PERSONALLY INNOCENT
THEY WILL LOSE THEIR TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL POSSESSIONS
HOW ABOUT THAT
HIS PRESENCE IS UNMISTAKABLE FOR THEY SPOKE WITH TONGUES AND MAGNIFIED GOD RIGHT HERE WE HAVE ONE MORE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL
BY WHOM THE WORLD IS CRUCIFIED UNTO ME AND I UNTO THE WORLD
THE FREEDOM OF FAITH MUST SUCCEED THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE LAW
IN THIS MASTERLY FASHION PAUL DRAWS OUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE LAW SIN DEATH AND EVERY EVIL AND CENTERS IT UPON CHRIST
THOSE WHO OPERATE WITHOUT A PROPER CALL SEEK NO GOOD PURPOSE
WHAT MAN EVEN IF HE IS A CHRISTIAN IS NOT DELIGHTED WITH HIS OWN PRAISE
OF THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL NOTHING CAN BE DISCOVERED IN THE WRITINGS OF THE MONKS OR SCHOLASTICS NOR FOR THAT MATTER IN THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENT FATHERS
THE LAW CAN DO NOTHING FOR US EXCEPT TO AROUSE THE CONSCIENCE
THIS IS NOT VAIN GLORY BUT NEEDFUL GLORYING
FROM DEATH TO LIFE
THE WORD COMPELLED ACQUAINTS US WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CONFERENCE
THEY PREACH CIRCUMCISION AND THUS RETAIN THE FAVOR OF THE JEWS
AND THE YOUNG LAD DOES IT
BUT THOUGH WE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL UNTO YOU THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE PREACHED UNTO YOU LET HIM BE ACCURSED
WHAT RIGHT THEN HAVE WE TO MAKE LITTLE OF DOCTRINE
PAUL HAS A PECULIAR STYLE A CELESTIAL WAY OF SPEAKING
THERE SHALL NO MAN SEE ME AND LIVE EXODUS 33:20
REJOICE AND BE EXCEEDING GLAD
BUT CONFIDENCE IN CHRIST WHO IS THE END OF THE LAW HOW SO IS CHRIST THE END OF THE LAW
WE REPLY
BECAUSE I EXHORT YOU TO MUTUAL LOVE YOU ARE NOT TO THINK THAT I HAVE GONE BACK ON MY TEACHING OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH ALONE
FIGHT IT OUT WITH DOUBT
I DO NOT MEAN TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION AS THOUGH I DID NOT LIVE BEFORE THIS
IN THEE SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE PRAISED
OF COURSE HIS ANGER MUST NOT FLOW FROM MALICE BUT FROM AFFECTION AND A REAL ZEAL FOR CHRIST
WE MUST SUFFER REPROACH SLANDERS DEATH
I CRUCIFIED CHRIST DAILY IN MY CLOISTERED LIFE AND BLASPHEMED GOD BY MY WRONG FAITH
THUS COVERED THE LAW NO LONGER SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE IN ITS UNDISGUISED MAJESTY
AS LONG AS WE HAVE THIS BODY SIN WILL DWELL IN OUR FLESH
GOD CREATES FAITH IN US THROUGH THE WORD
IT IS TRULY AMAZING THAT THE LAW HAD THE EFFRONTERY TO TURN UPON ITS DIVINE AUTHOR AND THAT WITHOUT A SHOW OF RIGHT
HENCE CHRIST IS NO MOSES NO TYRANT NO LAWGIVER BUT THE GIVER OF GRACE THE SAVIOR FULL OF MERCY
UNABLE TO STAND THE THOUGHT OF THE WRATH AND JUDGMENT OF GOD MANY A PERSON COMMITS SUICIDE
LET US EQUIP OURSELVES AGAINST THE ACCUSATIONS OF SATAN WITH THIS AND SIMILAR PASSAGES OF HOLY SCRIPTURE
FROM THAT CHRIST THAT CALLED YOU INTO GRACE
THE APOSTLE DOES NOT WISH THE GALATIANS GRACE AND PEACE FROM THE EMPEROR OR FROM KINGS OR FROM GOVERNORS BUT FROM GOD THE FATHER
VERSE 29
VERSE 29
SUCH OFFENSES ON THE PART OF THE SAINTS THE SCRIPTURES RECORD FOR THE COMFORT OF THOSE WHO ARE NEAR DESPAIR
I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE HIM UNPROFITABLE TO ME
THE PROMISES WERE MADE IN VIEW OF CHRIST IN ONE SEED NOT IN MANY SEEDS
THEY ARE BLIND
IT SAYS DIRECTLY THAT CHRIST WAS MADE A CURSE
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET US SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD FULFILL THE LAW IN THE SPIRIT OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF GOD
REMEMBER HE DOES NOT OWE THE LAD ANYTHING
TO IMAGINE THAT THE MIGHTY FORCES OF SIN DEATH AND THE CURSE CAN BE VANQUISHED BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF MAN'S PALTRY WORKS BY FASTING PILGRIMAGES MASSES VOWS AND SUCH GEWGAWS
VERSES 24 25
LET US NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE POPULAR CRY FOR CHARITY AND UNITY
ROBERT E
AND SO WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH THE SWINE WHO DIVE HEADLONG INTO THE FILTH OF LICENTIOUSNESS
BUT WHAT DOES THE LAW ACCOMPLISH FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED BY CHRIST
WE ARE CHILDREN OF THE PROMISE LIKE ISAAC BORN OF GRACE AND FAITH UNTO AN EVERLASTING INHERITANCE
THE SCRIPTURES ASCRIBE NO RIGHTEOUSNESS TO ABRAHAM EXCEPT THROUGH FAITH
THE OBJECT OF PETER'S VISIT WAS TO ACQUAINT CORNELIUS WITH THE FACT THAT CHRIST WAS NO LONGER TO BE LOOKED FOR BECAUSE HE IS HERE
THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO GIVE
LET US STUDY TO BE GOOD TIMEKEEPERS
THE LAW DRIVES US AWAY FROM GOD BUT CHRIST RECONCILES GOD UNTO US FOR HE IS THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKETH AWAY THE SINS OF THE WORLD NOW IF THE SIN OF THE WORLD IS TAKEN AWAY IT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME
AS IF PAUL WERE TO SAY
EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT I CANNOT KEEP THEM
DO YOU GALATIANS KNOW WHY THE FALSE APOSTLES ARE SO ZEALOUS ABOUT YOU
THE BUSINESS OF THE GOSPEL ON THE OTHER HAND IS TO QUICKEN TO COMFORT TO RAISE THE FALLEN
HENCE THOSE THAT SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE LAW ARE MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF LIFE THAN THE PUBLICANS SINNERS AND HARLOTS
OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH DISPROVED HERE WE SHALL TAKE THE TIME TO ENTER UPON THE OBJECTIONS WHICH OUR OPPONENTS RAISE AGAINST THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH
WHEN THE RICH SUFFER THE PANGS OF HUNGER GOD WILL FEED HIS OWN SERVANTS
WAS NOT GOD PATIENT WITH US ALSO WHILE WE WERE BLINDFOLDED BY THE PAPACY
THIS MAY HOLD TRUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE BUT NOT IN THE SPIRITUAL LIFE
HE MAY BE BOTH
IT WOULD BE TOO BAD IF THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS WERE TO CEASE TO THE CORINTHIANS HE EXPRESSED THE SAME CONVICTION
VERSE 15
VERSE 15
VERSE 15
VERSE 15
VERSE 15
VERSE 15
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT EMPHASIZE FREE WILL NATURAL STRENGTH THE WORKS OF SUPEREROGATION ETC
HOW THEN CAN THE LAW JUSTIFY US
BUT HE SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT HIS REAL LIFE
IF WE COULD BE FULLY PERSUADED THAT WE ARE IN THE GOOD GRACE OF GOD THAT OUR SINS ARE FORGIVEN THAT WE HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST THAT WE ARE THE BELOVED CHILDREN OF GOD WE WOULD BE EVER SO HAPPY AND GRATEFUL TO GOD
WHO CARES WHETHER THE WORLD PRAISES OR HATES US
PAUL THEREFORE URGES HIS GALATIANS AND INCIDENTALLY ALL BELIEVERS TO SERVE EACH OTHER IN LOVE
2:14 IT THEREFORE SEEKS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN EXTERNALS
BUT WHEN IT IS A MATTER OF JUSTIFICATION BEFORE GOD PAUL HAD TO SPEAK DISPARAGINGLY OF THE LAW BECAUSE THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JUSTIFICATION
STILL PEOPLE MUST BE TOLD THESE THINGS THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEIR DUTY OVER AGAINST THEIR PASTORS
MY CALL MAY SEEM INFERIOR TO YOU
THE LAW DEMANDS THAT WE FEAR LOVE AND WORSHIP GOD WITH A TRUE FAITH
WHICH I PREACH AMONG THE GENTILES
FOR ALL THE PROPHETS AND THE LAW PROPHESIED UNTIL JOHN MATTHEW 11:12 13 WHEN CHRIST CAME THE LAW AND THE CEREMONIES OF MOSES CEASED
NOTHING CAN TAKE AWAY SIN EXCEPT THE GRACE OF GOD
WE NEED THE CONTINUED HELP AND COMFORT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
THE BEST COMMENDATION OF ANY WORK IS TO KNOW THAT ONE HAS DONE THE WORK THAT GOD HAS GIVEN HIM WELL AND THAT GOD IS PLEASED WITH HIS EFFORT
TONGUE CANNOT EXPRESS NOR HEART CONCEIVE WHAT A TERRIBLE THING IT IS TO MAKE CHRIST WORTHLESS
GOD SAW THAT THE UNIVERSAL ILLUSION OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS COULD NOT BE PUT DOWN IN ANY OTHER WAY BUT BY THE LAW
IF ONE CAN EARN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND EVERLASTING LIFE THROUGH ONE'S OWN EFFORTS TO WHAT PURPOSE WAS CHRIST BORN
THE SAME REASONS THAT OBLIGATE A PERSON TO ACCEPT CIRCUMCISION ALSO OBLIGATE A PERSON TO ACCEPT THE WHOLE LAW
IT ENTERS THE HEART BY FAITH
ANY OTHER DOCTRINE CANNOT BE BETTER THAN MINE
FOR THESE ARE THE TWO COVENANTS
YOU ARE DOING ALL YOU CAN IF YOU RESIST THE FLESH AND DO NOT FULFILL ITS DEMANDS
THE FACT IS WHEN THE APOSTLES HEARD THAT I HAD RECEIVED THE CHARGE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE GENTILES FROM CHRIST
AND LET US NOT BE WEARY IN WELL DOING
GOD DID NOT COMMAND ABRAHAM TO TAKE HAGAR NOR DID GOD PROMISE TO BLESS THE COALITION
O MY GALATIANS DO NOT BELIEVE THE COUNTERFEIT APOSTLES WHAT DOES PAUL MEAN BY SAYING THAT THE GOSPEL OF THE UNCIRCUMCISION WAS COMMITTED UNTO HIM AND THAT OF THE CIRCUMCISION TO PETER
JESUS ANSWERED THEM JOHN 8:39 40 IF YE WERE ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN YE WOULD DO THE WORKS OF ABRAHAM
THEY ACT LIKE THE FOOLISH CARPENTER WHO STARTS WITH THE ROOF WHEN HE BUILDS A HOUSE
MAN'S OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS IS IN THE LAST ANALYSIS A DESPISING AND REJECTING OF THE GRACE OF GOD
TO CONCLUDE PAUL REFUSED TO CIRCUMCISE TITUS FOR THE REASON THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WANTED TO COMPEL HIM TO CIRCUMCISE TITUS
GOD FORGIVE THEE BROTHER
8:7 BE CAREFUL YOU SCOFFERS
WE MAY NOW SAY TO THE LAW
AND THAT IS WHAT THE LAW IS A BIG AXE
YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME
PAUL IS TAKING LIBERTIES WITH MOSES BY GENERALIZING THE STATEMENTS IN DEUTERONOMY 21:23
IT CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN THE WICKED
DON'T YOU THINK HE DESERVED THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST I ANSWER
WE HAD GIVEN THEM NO OFFENSE NO OCCASION TO HATE US
IT IS CUSTOMARY WITH PAUL TO LAY THE DOCTRINAL FOUNDATION FIRST AND THEN TO BUILD ON IT THE GOLD SILVER AND GEMS OF GOOD DEEDS
A PERSON SIMPLY IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE WORKS OF THE LAW
IT IS ONE OF HIS LITTLE TRICKS TO BLAME THE GOSPEL FOR EVERY EVIL IN THE WORLD
THEY CALL A DOER OF THE LAW ONE WHO PERFORMS THE LAW IN ITS LITERAL SENSE
IF THIS HOLDS TRUE IN THE CASE OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THE MORAL LAW WHAT WILL BECOME OF THOSE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO ENDEAVOR TO BE JUSTIFIED BY THEIR OWN REGULATIONS AND VOWS
WHEN A CRIMINAL IS BROUGHT TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION THE MONKS TRY TO COMFORT HIM IN THIS MANNER
THEIR WORK-RIGHTEOUSNESS IS PLAIN IDOLATRY AND BLASPHEMY AGAINST GOD
THIS IS A HARD SAYING BUT VERY NECESSARY FOR THOSE FALSE CHRISTIANS AND HYPOCRITES WHO SPEAK MUCH ABOUT THE GOSPEL ABOUT FAITH AND THE SPIRIT YET LIVE AFTER THE FLESH
WHAT CHANCE HAS A DEFENSELESS HUMAN CREATURE AGAINST THESE POWERS OF DARKNESS
DO I SERVE MEN OR GOD PAUL KEEPS AN EYE ON THE FALSE APOSTLES THOSE FLATTERERS OF MEN
PEOPLE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXERCISED IN THEIR FAITH BY AFFLICTIONS
THE LAW IS A GOOD THING
IT CANNOT BE DONE
HE WISHES THEM HEAVENLY PEACE THE KIND OF WHICH JESUS SPOKE WHEN HE SAID PEACE I LEAVE UNTO YOU
THE BEGGING FRIARS BROUGHT IN THEIR SHARE
THE LAW OF MOSES LEAVES NO LOOPHOLES
FOR IF I YET PLEASED MEN I SHOULD NOT BE THE SERVANT OF CHRIST
UNDER HIS DIRECTION THE WORLD PERSECUTES THE GOSPEL AND WOULD IF IT COULD NAIL AGAIN CHRIST THE SON OF GOD TO THE CROSS ALTHOUGH HE GAVE HIMSELF INTO DEATH FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD
WITH THEIR DOCTRINE THESE LYING SECTS OF PERDITION DEFACE THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST TO THIS DAY
THE DEVIL KNOWS BETTER THAN TO APPEAR UGLY AND BLACK
UNLESS THE MINISTERS OF CHRIST ARE WISE IN HANDLING THE MYSTERIES OF GOD AND RIGHTLY DIVIDE THE WORD FAITH AND GOOD WORKS MAY EASILY BE CONFUSED
WHY DID HE SUFFER
FOR THE LABORER IS WORTHY OF HIS HIRE LUKE 10:7 AND PAUL SAYS ELSEWHERE
BEAR WITH HIS WEAKNESS AND LOVE HIM
THE CHURCH PETER THE APOSTLES ANGELS FROM HEAVEN ARE NOT TO BE HEARD UNLESS THEY TEACH THE GENUINE WORD OF GOD
PSALM 2 BUT ALL THEIR COUNSELS SHALL BE BROUGHT TO NAUGHT
OUR OPPONENTS WILL BEAR US OUT WHEN WE SAY THAT WE NEVER FAIL TO URGE RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THAT IS THE WILL OF GOD
IF WE ONLY TEACH WORKS AS OUR OPPONENTS DO WE SHALL LOSE THE FAITH
PAUL ASSERTS THAT HE TEACHES THE SAME TRUTH NOW WHICH HE HAS ALWAYS TAUGHT AND THAT THE GALATIANS RAN WELL AS LONG AS THEY OBEYED THE TRUTH
PETER ALSO CALLS IT A YOKE
HIS CONTACT WITH ANANIAS WAS MERELY A TESTIMONIAL TO THE FACT THAT PAUL HAD BEEN CALLED BY CHRIST TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
IF WE LOSE SIGHT OF CHRIST AND BEGIN TO CONSIDER OUR PAST WE SIMPLY GO TO PIECES
THE MONKS IMAGINED THE WORLD WAS CRUCIFIED UNTO THEM WHEN THEY ENTERED THE MONASTERY
OR ON ACCOUNT OF MY PRAYERS FASTINGS AND WORKS
AND OUR EFFORTS ARE NOT ENTIRELY IN VAIN
THIS ARGUMENT IS CONVINCING ENOUGH
OR DO YOU THINK THAT GOD SPARED NOT HIS SON BUT DELIVERED HIM FOR US ALL FOR THE FUN OF IT
AS MANY AS DESIRE TO MAKE A FAIR SHEW IN THE FLESH THEY CONSTRAIN YOU TO BE CIRCUMCISED
LET US FORTIFY OUR CONSCIENCE WITH SIMILAR ARGUMENTS
THE LIST MIGHT BE EXTENDED INDEFINITELY
I WAS SO MUCH IN EARNEST THAT I IMPOSED UPON MY BODY MORE THAN IT COULD STAND
THEN IS THE OFFENSE OF THE CROSS CEASED
ALL THE SAME THEY COULD NOT OBTAIN A QUIET CONSCIENCE AND PEACE IN CHRIST
HE IS AN IDOLATER OF HIMSELF
YOU MOST OF ALL SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST BY THE LAW IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
JESUS SAID
THE FIRST DANGER IS
BELABOR THAT BUT DON'T TALK TO MY CONSCIENCE
THEY MAKE SPORT OF THE SCRIPTURES AND SLANDER THE SAYINGS OF THE HOLY GHOST
AS SUCH YOU MAY BOLDLY SAY
THE DOCTRINE OF THE BIBLE IS NOT OURS TO TAKE OR TO ALLOW LIBERTIES WITH
AND BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN THE CHRIST TO COME PETER WAS DELEGATED TO PREACH UNTO CORNELIUS FAITH IN THE CHRIST WHO HAD ALREADY COME
THERE CAN BE NO COMPARISON BETWEEN DOCTRINE AND LIFE
THAT WE MIGHT BE MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN HIM ALTHOUGH THIS AND SIMILAR PASSAGES MAY BE PROPERLY EXPLAINED BY SAYING THAT CHRIST WAS MADE A SACRIFICE FOR THE CURSE AND FOR SIN YET IN MY JUDGMENT IT IS BETTER TO LEAVE THESE PASSAGES STAND AS THEY READ
ISHMAEL WILL PERSECUTE ISAAC
HENCE THE LAW DOES NOT JUSTIFY BUT FAITH IN CHRIST JUSTIFIES
IN THE SAME MANNER WAS DEATH DEFEATED
YOU STUTTER SO MUCH
DAVID WAS A HOLY MAN AND A GOOD KING
NOW PAUL TURNS TO THE GALATIANS AND MAKES THIS SUMMARY STATEMENT
THERE ABOVE ALL FAITH MUST PRECEDE EVERYTHING
I AM COME TO SEND FIRE ON THE EARTH AND WHAT WILL I IF IT BE ALREADY KINDLED LUKE 12:49 DO NOT TAKE THE STATEMENT OF OUR OPPONENTS SERIOUSLY THAT NO GOOD CAN COME OF THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
A CHRISTIAN IS NOT SOMEBODY WHO CHALKS(SP SIN BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN CHRIST
TO MUDDLE THE TWO IS TO ELIMINATE THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST ENTIRELY IT SEEMS A SMALL MATTER TO MINGLE THE LAW AND GOSPEL FAITH AND WORKS BUT IT CREATES MORE MISCHIEF THAN MAN'S BRAIN CAN CONCEIVE
I HAVE LIVED A WICKED LIFE
BUT YOU HAVEN'T MANIFESTED ANY OF THESE FRUITS UNDER THE REGIME OF THE LAW
GENTLENESS CAN GET ALONG WITH FORWARD AND DIFFICULT PERSONS ACCORDING TO THE OLD PAGAN SAYING
YES IF A PERSON COULD PERFECTLY BELIEVE THIS HE WOULD NOT LONG REMAIN ALIVE
OUR STUBBORNNESS IS RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE IN CHRIST
HE SAYS I AM DEAD TO THE LAW THAT I MIGHT LIVE UNTO GOD THE FALSE APOSTLES SAID THE VERY OPPOSITE
HE FAILED TO CALL THE GOSPEL TO HIS AID
IT HURTS HIM TO THINK THAT HIS GALATIANS SHOWED SO LITTLE STABILITY
I AM REPEATING WHAT THE APOSTLES AND ALL TEACHERS OF GOD HAVE TAUGHT LONG AGO
FOR IF OUR SINS COULD BE REMOVED BY OUR OWN EFFORTS WHAT NEED WAS THERE FOR THE SON OF GOD TO BE GIVEN FOR THEM
HAVE YE SUFFERED SO MANY THINGS IN VAIN
NO PERSON IS TO VAUNT HIMSELF ABOVE OTHERS OR FIND FAULT WITH THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS WHILE LAUDING HIS OWN
IT IS THE GOSPEL'S BUSINESS TO TELL ME THAT
ALL THIS IS TO PUT ON CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL
WHEN OUR OPPONENTS HEAR US REPEAT THIS STATEMENT OF PAUL THEY MAKE IT APPEAR AS IF WE TAUGHT THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT BE HONORED AS IF WE FAVORED REBELLION AGAINST THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES AS IF WE CONDEMNED ALL LAWS
HE IS A MERE RECIPIENT
FOR AS A LIBERATION FROM GOD'S WRATH THROUGH THE KIND OFFICE OF CHRIST IS NOT A PASSING BOON BUT A PERMANENT BLESSING SO ALSO THE YOKE OF THE LAW IS NOT A TEMPORARY BUT AN EVERLASTING AFFLICTION
THERE IS A TIME TO DIE AND A TIME TO LIVE
HE WAS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN GOD AND THE PEOPLE
ALL WHO SAY THAT FAITH ALONE IN CHRIST DOES NOT JUSTIFY A PERSON CONVERT CHRIST INTO A MINISTER OF SIN A TEACHER OF THE LAW AND A CRUEL TYRANT WHO REQUIRES THE IMPOSSIBLE
THE WHOLE LAW IS COMPREHENDED IN THIS ONE SENTENCE THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF GOD IS NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN CEREMONIES NOR HAS HE ANY USE FOR THEM
THIS IS THE RULE BY WHICH WE OUGHT TO LIVE THAT YE PUT ON THE NEW MAN WHICH AFTER GOD IS CREATED IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUE HOLINESS EPH
THAT THE LAW IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PROMISE IS PLAIN
THE GOSPEL IS THAT KIND OF A DOCTRINE
VISUALIZE CHRIST IN THESE HIS TRUE COLORS
WE MUST KNOW HOW LONG THE LAW IS TO PUT IN ITS LICKS
CHARITY MAY BE NEGLECTED AT TIMES WITHOUT PERIL BUT NOT THE WORD AND FAITH
TO RESIST THE FLESH IN THIS MANNER IS TO NAIL IT TO THE CROSS
10:37 FOR DEFENDING THE TRUTH IN OUR DAY WE ARE CALLED PROUD AND OBSTINATE HYPOCRITES
YOU ARE NOT SO HOLY YOURSELF
THE GENIUS OF CHRISTIANITY TAKES THE WORDS OF PAUL WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS AS TRUE AND EFFICACIOUS
THE DEMONSTRATION SEEMED TO PROVE CONVINCING FOR IT WAS AGREED THAT ONE MAY AS WELL OFFER LUTHER IN THE ORIGINAL GERMAN OR LATIN AS EXPECT THE AMERICAN CHURCH-MEMBER TO READ ANY TRANSLATIONS THAT WOULD ADHERE TO LUTHER'S GERMAN OR LATIN CONSTRUCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE MID-VICTORIAN TYPE OF ENGLISH CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TRANSLATIONS NOW ON THE MARKET
BUT NEITHER TITUS WHO WAS WITH ME BEING A GREEK WAS COMPELLED TO BE CIRCUMCISED
BUT WHERE DID PETER ACQUIRE THIS POWER
WE CONDEMN MAN'S FREE WILL HIS STRENGTH WISDOM AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
BUT NOW AFTER THAT YE HAVE KNOWN GOD
LEAST WE ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE PERSON GOD LEAVES WITH IMPORTANT PERSONS OFFENSES AND SINS SOMETIMES ASTOUNDING SHORTCOMINGS TO SHOW US THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY PERSON AND GOD
LET US BEAR THIS IN MIND WHEN THE DEVIL ACCUSES OUR CONSCIENCE
BUT BECAUSE CHRIST IS GOD HE HAD AN EVERLASTING AND UNCONQUERABLE RIGHTEOUSNESS
REASON PROTESTED THAT IT WAS ABSURD TO THINK THAT SARAH WHO WAS NINETY YEARS OLD AND BARREN BY NATURE SHOULD GIVE BIRTH TO A SON
PAUL HASTENS TO TELL THE GALATIANS THAT THEY WERE EXCHANGING THEIR CHRISTIAN LIBERTY FOR THE WEAK AND BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD
WE HAVE THE LAW WE HAVE GOOD WORKS
12:11 ALTHOUGH PAUL SEEKS TO SOFTEN THE EFFECT OF HIS REPROACHFUL WORDS HE DOES NOT TAKE THEM BACK
AMEN TRUE THE MERIT OF CHRIST IS MENTIONED IN THIS FORMULA OF ABSOLUTION
FROM THE DAYS OF JOHN THE BAPTIST SAYS JESUS UNTIL NOW THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SUFFERETH VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE
THIS IS THE CONSTITUTION OF YOUR PRICELESS LIBERTY
I HAVE A FRIEND WHOSE NAME IS JESUS CHRIST IN WHOM I BELIEVE
THE WORTH OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIBERTY CANNOT BE EXAGGERATED
PAUL'S INTENTION IS TO EXALT HIS OWN MINISTRY WHILE DISCREDITING THEIRS
PETER CONVERTED THE CENTURION
FOR THE FLESH LUSTETH AGAINST THE SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT AGAINST THE FLESH
THE FACT IS THEY ARE SUCH EXCELLENT WORKS THAT THE WORLD CANNOT POSSIBLY ESTIMATE THEM AT THEIR TRUE VALUE
IN THIS THING THE LORD PARDON THY SERVANT THAT WHEN MY MASTER GOETH INTO THE HOUSE OF RIMMON TO WORSHIP THERE AND HE LEANETH ON MY HAND AND I BOW MYSELF IN THE HOUSE OF RIMMON
HOW DID CHRIST DO IT
SINCE CHRIST IS NOW LIVING IN ME HE ABOLISHES THE LAW CONDEMNS SIN AND DESTROYS DEATH IN ME
WHAT THEY SAY HAS NO BEARING ON THE ARGUMENT
DEFY SATAN IN TIMES OF DESPAIR
BEFORE HE CURSED HIMSELF HIS BRETHREN AND AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN
OR DO I SEEK TO PLEASE MEN
LUKE FIRST PRAISES CORNELIUS FOR BEING A DEVOUT AND GOD-FEARING MAN AND THEN LUKE MENTIONS THE GOOD WORKS THE ALMS AND PRAYERS OF CORNELIUS
THEY USURP THE DIVINITY AND OFFICE OF CHRIST
INSTEAD OF DOING THE LAW THESE LAW-CONSCIOUS HYPOCRITES BREAK THE LAW
THIS HAPPENED IN THE CHURCHES OF GALATIA WHICH PAUL HAD BROUGHT INTO LIFE IN SPIRITUAL TRAVAIL
PAUL ANSWERED
HE LIVED A CHASTE AND HOLY LIFE
BUT WHEN THINGS HAVE COME TO SUCH A PASS THAT GOD AND HIS WORD ARE OPENLY BLASPHEMED THEN WE MUST SAY
HE PREACHED NOT A GOSPEL OF HIS OWN INVENTION BUT THE VERY SAME GOSPEL GOD HAD LONG AGO PRESCRIBED IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
NEW DETERMINATIONS AFFECT OUR WILL
BUT THERE IS NO BITTERNESS IN OUR HEART
WE KNOW THAT WE MUST ALSO TEACH GOOD WORKS BUT THEY MUST BE TAUGHT IN THEIR PROPER TURN WHEN THE DISCUSSION IS CONCERNING WORKS AND NOT THE ARTICLE OF JUSTIFICATION
BUT OUR DOCTRINE GOD BE PRAISED IS PURE BECAUSE ALL THE ARTICLES OF OUR FAITH ARE GROUNDED ON THE HOLY SCRIPTURES
THEY MUST CORRECT NOTHING
CHRIST CALLED HIM A CHOSEN VESSEL AND EQUIPPED WITH A FACILITY OF EXPRESSION FAR ABOVE THAT OF THE OTHER APOSTLES THAT HE AS THE CHOSEN VESSEL SHOULD ESTABLISH THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTIFICATION IN CLEAR-CUT WORDS
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GOSPEL
CHRIST GAVE US NO OTHER LAW THAN THIS LAW OF MUTUAL LOVE
OR RATHER ARE KNOWN OF GOD
HE DOES NOT POUNCE ON THEM BUT LIKE A FATHER HE FAIRLY EXCUSES THEIR ERROR
THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH THE APOSTLES WHILE PAUL HAD NEVER SEEN CHRIST IN PERSON OR HAD MUCH CONTACT WITH THE REST OF THE APOSTLES
THROUGH CHRIST
THEY MUST ADD NOTHING
WE QUARREL WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO HAVE JESUS MERIT COUNT ALONE FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
BLESSED ARE YE WHEN MEN SHALL REVILE YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU AND SHALL SAY ALL MANNER OF EVIL AGAINST YOU FALSELY FOR MY SAKE
TRUE PAUL DOES CALL SARAH JERUSALEM
EVERY LAW IS GIVEN TO RESTRAIN SIN
PAUL ADMITS THAT HE CONFERRED WITH THE APOSTLES CONCERNING HIS GOSPEL
BUT WHAT DO I DO
SUCH WARFARE OF CONDEMNATION IS ALWAYS GOING ON IN THE CHURCH
THIS HAPPY INNOVATION IS NOT A DERIVATIVE OF REASON OR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT BUT SOLELY THE GIFT AND OPERATION OF THE HOLY GHOST
LET EVERY BELIEVER CAREFULLY LEARN THE GOSPEL
NOT THE KIND OF SAINTS THE PAPISTS ADMIRE BUT THE KIND OF SAINTS CHRIST WANTS
IN BIDDING YOU TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT I INDICATE TO YOU THAT OUR LOVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY US
WHAT WAS THE SENSE OF HAVING VOWED CHASTITY POVERTY OBEDIENCE
THIS HAPPY CONDITION SECURED BY MANY YEARS OF ARDUOUS LABORS SOME LUNATIC MIGHT SPOIL IN A MOMENT
REASON THINKS IT LUDICROUS THAT FAITH SHOULD BE THE FOREMOST SERVICE ANY PERSON CAN RENDER UNTO GOD
BUT PAUL IS NOW TREATING OF FAITH AND CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE PERSON AND OFFICE OF CHRIST NOT OF THE VIRGINITY OF MARY
HE THAT SOWETH TO THE SPIRIT I.E HE THAT HONORS THE MINISTERS OF GOD IS DOING A SPIRITUAL THING AND WILL REAP EVERLASTING LIFE
PAUL'S CUSTOM WAS TO ENTER INTO THE SYNAGOGUES OF THE JEWS THERE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
THAT GOD ADOPTED US IS DUE TO THE MERIT OF JESUS CHRIST THE SON OF GOD WHO HUMBLED HIMSELF UNDER THE LAW AND REDEEMED US LAW-RIDDEN SINNERS
VAINGLORY IS NOT NEARLY SO BAD IN A PRIVATE PERSON OR EVEN IN AN OFFICIAL AS IT IS IN A MINISTER
IN THIS WAY THESE PERVERSE FANATICS PARADE THEIR CURSED DOCTRINE AS THE WORD OF GOD AND FLYING THE FLAG OF GOD'S NAME THEY DECEIVE MANY
WHEN SATAN CANNOT SUPPRESS THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BY FORCE HE TRIES TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE BY STRIKING THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL WITH POVERTY
HOELTER AND IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
FOR HE THAT IS HANGED IS ACCURSED OF GOD MOSES SPEAKS OF A CRIMINAL WHO IS WORTHY OF DEATH HOW OUR OPPONENTS ASK CAN THIS PASSAGE BE APPLIED TO THE HOLY CHRIST AS IF HE WERE ACCURSED OF GOD AND WORTHY TO BE HANGED THIS PIECE OF EXEGESIS MAY IMPRESS THE NAIVE AS A ZEALOUS ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THE HONOR AND GLORY OF CHRIST
THEN AFTER THREE YEARS I WENT UP TO JERUSALEM TO SEE PETER AND ABODE WITH HIM FIFTEEN DAYS
BUT PAUL IS NOT NOW TREATING OF THIS CIVIL USE AND FUNCTION OF THE LAW
THUS SIN IS NOT ONLY REVEALED BY THE LAW
THEY ARE SILLY
PAUL SIMPLY INVERTS THEIR ARGUMENT

IF YOUR CONSCIENCE IS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF SIN TALK TO YOUR CONSCIENCE
THEY INTEND TO APPEASE THE WRATH OF GOD AND TO DESERVE GOD'S GRACE BY THEIR EXERTIONS
WE WOULD NOT BE SO ATTACHED TO THE WORLD AND THE THINGS OF THE WORLD
I CANNOT GET OVER THE BLINDNESS OF THE POPE'S THEOLOGIANS
WE WANT THEM TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT IF THEY USE THEIR LIVES AND POSSESSIONS AFTER THEIR OWN PLEASURE IF THEY DO NOT HELP THE POOR IF THEY CHEAT THEIR FELLOW-MEN IN BUSINESS AND SNATCH AND SCRAPE BY HOOK AND BY CROOK EVERYTHING THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON WE WANT TO TELL THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT FREE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY THINK THEY ARE BUT THEY ARE THE DIRTY SLAVES OF THE DEVIL AND ARE SEVEN TIMES WORSE THAN THEY EVER WERE AS THE SLAVES OF THE POPE
THE LAW IS FAR REMOVED FROM THEIR THOUGHTS
WAS IT NOT IRREVERENT FOR HIM TO SPEAK THAT WAY ABOUT THE HOLY LAW OF GOD
YOU DO NOT NEED ANY BOOK OF INSTRUCTIONS TO TEACH YOU HOW TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR
PAUL KNEW THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WOULD MISCONSTRUE HIS CENSURE OF THE GALATIANS TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE AND SAY
PAUL DID NOT CONDEMN CIRCUMCISION IN ITSELF
GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND ORDINANCES ARE BLESSINGS OF GOD FOR THIS LIFE ONLY
BUT WHEN GRACE HAS ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED THEY CONTINUE GOD IS IN THE POSITION OF A DEBTOR AND IS IN DUTY BOUND TO REWARD A GOOD WORK WITH THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE
HE FINDS OUT THAT HE IS SO DEPRAVED THAT NO STRENGTH NO WORKS NO MERITS OF HIS OWN WILL EVER DELIVER HIM FROM HIS GUILT
FOR THE FIRST GOD IS NO DEBTOR THEY SAY
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ALL THESE TRAPPINGS
WHOEVER PRAISES LUTHER IS A WORSE SINNER THAN AN IDOLATER PERJURER OR THIEF
THESE RESTRAIN ME AS IRON BARS RESTRAIN A LION AND A BEAR
LET US BECOME EXPERT IN THE ART OF TRANSFERRING OUR SINS OUR DEATH AND EVERY EVIL FROM OURSELVES TO CHRIST
DO YOU NOW SEE HOW FAITH JUSTIFIES WITHOUT WORKS
SOMETIMES THE DEVIL DISTORTS CHRIST TO MY VISION
GREAT THEN IS THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT
ANY PERSON'S LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT MUST BE RESPECTED
HE FORESAW THAT NOTHING WOULD BE LESS KNOWN IN THE WORLD SOME DAY THAN THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST
THE APOSTLE SPEAKS THESE WORDS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INDIGNATION
THESE LAST HAVE WROUGHT BUT ONE HOUR AND THOU HAST MADE THEM EQUAL UNTO US WHICH HAVE BORNE THE BURDEN AND HEAT OF THE DAY MATTHEW 20:12 THEY COMPLAINED THAT THE HEATHEN WHO AT ONE TIME HAD BEEN WORSHIPERS OF IDOLS OBTAINED GRACE WITHOUT THE DRUDGERY OF THE LAW THAT WAS THEIRS
THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW IS NOT TO GIVE LIFE
THERE PAUL SPEAKS OF TWO MINISTERS
AN ANTICHRIST LAYS CLAIM TO THE HONOR OF CHRIST
PAUL'S CONCERN FOR THEM MEANT NOTHING TO SOME OF THE GALATIANS
WE HAVE FOUND THIS MAN A PESTILENT FELLOW AND A MOVER OF SEDITION AMONG ALL THE JEWS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND A RINGLEADER OF THE SECT OF THE NAZARENES THE GENTILES UTTERED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS
I CHIDE YOU NOT BECAUSE I WISH YOU ILL
HE HAS NOT SEEN CHRIST NOR HAS HE HAD MUCH CONTACT WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES
THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MINISTRY THEY MAINTAIN THEY CANNOT LIVE ON THEIR SALARIES THEY WHIMPER ABOUT THE MISERABLE TREATMENT THEY RECEIVE AT THE HAND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DELIVERED FROM THE SERVITUDE OF THE LAW BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL
THEY LIKE TO TREAT THE MINISTERS LIKE SERVANTS AND SLAVES
THIS CHEERING FORM OF SPEECH IS FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE SCRIPTURES PARTICULARLY IN THE WRITINGS OF ST PAUL WHEN THE LAW IS SET AGAINST THE LAW AND SIN IS MADE TO OPPOSE SIN AND DEATH IS ARRAYED AGAINST DEATH AND HELL IS TURNED LOOSE AGAINST HELL AS IN THE FOLLOWING QUOTATIONS
BECAUSE SATAN ALWAYS ASSAILS BOTH THE PURITY OF DOCTRINE WHICH HE ENDEAVORS TO TAKE AWAY BY SCHISMS AND THE PURITY OF LIFE WHICH HE SPOILS WITH HIS CONTINUAL TEMPTATIONS TO SIN PAUL EXPLAINS HOW THE FALLEN SHOULD BE TREATED
SECONDLY THEY DIFFER IN REGARD TO THEIR FUNCTIONS
I BELIEVE THAT BUT IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE YOUR EYES YOU WILL FIND MANY SHORTCOMINGS AND OFFENSES IN THE MEMBERS OF THE HOLY CHURCH
THIS SIMILE OF SOWING AND REAPING ALSO REFERS TO THE PROPER SUPPORT OF MINISTERS
I HAVE PRESENTED CHRIST TO YOU I HAVE PLEADED WITH YOU I HAVE REPROVED YOU I HAVE OVERLOOKED NOTHING THAT I THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF BENEFIT TO YOU
HERE PAUL WOULD HAVE CLOSED HIS EPISTLE BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY
PAUL'S REASON FOR PRAISING THE GALATIANS IS TO AVOID GIVING THEM THE IMPRESSION AS IF HE WERE THEIR ENEMY BECAUSE HE HAD REPRIMANDED THEM
IF CORNELIUS HAD DIED BEFORE CHRIST HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IN THE CHRIST TO COME
IT FORTIFIES A PERSON AGAINST EVERY DANGER
IN JESUS CHRIST
SUPPOSING THAT THIS EXPLANATION WILL NOT SATISFY THE SCHOLASTICS SUPPOSING THAT THEY SHOULD COMPLETELY WRAP ME UP IN THEIR ARGUMENTS THEY CANNOT DO IT I WOULD RATHER BE WRONG AND GIVE ALL CREDIT TO CHRIST ALONE
VERSES 13 14
IS THERE NO GRACE NO FORGIVENESS NO JOY PEACE LIFE HEAVEN NO CHRIST AND GOD
GOD WOULD BE A LIAR BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE FULFILLED HIS PROMISES
IN THEE SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED BECAUSE THOU HAST KEPT THE LAW WHEN ABRAHAM WAS STILL UNCIRCUMCISED AND WITHOUT THE LAW OR ANY LAW INDEED WHEN HE WAS STILL AN IDOL WORSHIPER GOD SAID TO HIM
THE LAW CAN ONLY ACCUSE TERRIFY AND KILL HIM
FOR THE PEACE OF THE WORLD OUT OF GRATITUDE TO GOD AND FOR A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT OTHERS MAY BE ATTRACTED TO THE GOSPEL
IT IS BUILT ON A BETTER FOUNDATION
IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE OF CHRIST THE APOSTLES PERFORMED GREATER MIRACLES THAN CHRIST HIMSELF
IT SUPPLIES A CERTAIN NEED
WHAT AWFUL PRESUMPTION TO IMAGINE THAT THERE IS ANY WORK GOOD ENOUGH TO PACIFY GOD WHEN TO PACIFY GOD REQUIRED THE INVALUABLE PRICE OF THE DEATH AND BLOOD OF HIS OWN AND ONLY SON
FOR YE HAVE HEARD OF MY CONVERSATION IN TIME PAST IN THE JEWS RELIGION HOW THAT BEYOND MEASURE I PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF GOD AND WASTED IT
2:14 THIS ONE WORD MEDIATOR IS PROOF ENOUGH THAT THE LAW CANNOT JUSTIFY
YET BY YOUR EXAMPLE YOU OBLIGATE THE GENTILES TO FORSAKE CHRIST AND TO RETURN TO THE LAW
PAUL EXPLAINS WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUE CHRISTIAN RIGHTEOUSNESS
THE MORE GENERAL TERM WOMAN INDICATES THAT CHRIST WAS BORN A TRUE MAN
FROM GOD THAT CALLED YOU INTO THE GRACE OF CHRIST I PREFER THE FORMER FOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PAUL'S PURPOSE IS TO IMPRESS UPON US THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST
BUT THIS DOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING HOLY
IN ACCUSING ME OF BEING A DAMNABLE SINNER YOU ARE CUTTING YOUR OWN THROAT SATAN
THIS HAPPENED EVERYWHERE
WE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND HOW SPIRITUAL LIFE ORIGINATES
YE HAVE NOT INJURED ME AT ALL
FOR MEN OF ALL AGES HAVE HAD THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE RIGHT WHEN THEY FOLLOW AFTER THE LAW AND OUTWARDLY PERFORM ITS REQUIREMENTS
I TAUGHT YOU THE DOCTRINE OF GRACE AND OF LIBERTY FROM THE LAW FROM SIN AND WRATH THAT YOU SHOULD BE FREE IN CHRIST AND NOT SLAVES TO THE HARD LAWS OF MOSES
BUT BECAUSE OF THESE ADVANTAGES THEY WERE NOT TO THINK THEMSELVES RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD
HE IS TO BE PRAISED TO THE SKY FOR HIS FAITH
THAT I MIGHT PREACH HIM AMONG THE HEATHEN
THEY IN TURN HATE AND PERSECUTE US FOR VILE HERETICS
SENTENCE IS PRONOUNCED UPON THEM THAT THEY SHALL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
MAKE AMPLE USE OF THIS PRONOUN OUR BE ASSURED THAT CHRIST HAS CANCELED THE SINS NOT OF CERTAIN PERSONS ONLY BUT YOUR SINS
THIS IS THE OFFICE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH WHICH DISTRIBUTES THE PROMISED BLESSING BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY ADMINISTERING THE SACRAMENTS BY COMFORTING THE BROKEN-HEARTED IN SHORT BY DISPENSING THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST
LET HIM CONTINUE IN HUMBLE PRAYER
THEY MAKE CHRIST OVER INTO A MURDERER AND MOSES INTO A SAVIOR
NOT TO SERVE AS A MEDIUM BY WHICH THE PROMISE MIGHT BE OBTAINED
A CHRISTIAN IS BELOVED OF GOD AND A SINNER
WHEN HE SAYS TO HIS FACE PAUL ACCUSES THE FALSE APOSTLES OF SLANDERING HIM BEHIND HIS BACK
BUT FAITH WON THE VICTORY AND ROUTED REASON THAT UGLY BEAST AND ENEMY OF GOD
HUMBLE MAN THAT HE WAS HE WILL NOT NOW TAKE A BACK SEAT
THIS THAT WE MAY FIND THE WAY TO GRACE
FAITH TRUSTS IN GOD AND IS NEVER WRONG
HOW CAN THE LAW JUSTIFY WHEN THAT WHOLE SANCTIFIED PEOPLE OF ISRAEL AND EVEN MEDIATOR MOSES TREMBLED AT THE VOICE OF GOD
PAUL SEEMS TO THINK RATHER ILL OF THE LAW
WITH THIS STATEMENT PAUL DEALS A DEATH BLOW TO THE LAW
IT STRIKES ALSO THOSE WHO LIVED IN ALL SINCERITY TO PLEASE GOD AND TO MERIT THE FORGIVENESS OF THEIR SINS THROUGH A LIFE OF SELF-DENIAL
THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS IS MY EPISTLE
TALK TO YOUR CONSCIENCE
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY RECEIVED THE SPIRIT BY THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL BUT BY THE SAME GOSPEL YOU WERE ENABLED TO DO THINGS WHAT THINGS WE ASK
FORMERLY WE DID NOT CONFESS CHRIST TO BE OUR ONLY MERIT AS WE DO NOW IN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL
HENCE IT CONSTITUTES THE MIGHTY INFLUENCE OF THE DEVIL OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD
ABEL PLEASED THE LORD BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH
PREVIOUSLY PAUL HAD SAID THAT THE LAW WAS GIVEN TO REVEAL THE WRATH AND DEATH OF GOD UPON ALL SINNERS
TO OBEY MOSES IN ONE POINT REQUIRES OBEDIENCE TO HIM IN ALL POINTS
IF WE ARE NOT IN THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST IT IS CERTAIN WE BELONG TO THE KINGDOM OF SATAN AND WE ARE PRESSED INTO HIS SERVICE WITH EVERY TALENT WE POSSESS
LET THE SEA FURNISH FISH THE EARTH GRAIN THE WOODS TREES ETC
THERE ARE THREE WAYS IN WHICH THE LAW MAY BE ABUSED
YOU ARE ESTABLISHED IN THIS BELIEF THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD BECAUSE HE GIVES GRACE AND PEACE GIFTS WHICH ONLY GOD CAN CREATE AND BESTOW VERSE 4
THEY THINK ITS MEANING SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO THE CONTEXT
THIS PASSAGE IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE WHOLE PAPACY
FIRST HE MENTIONS VARIOUS KINDS OF CARNAL LUSTS AS ADULTERY FORNICATION WANTONNESS ETC
IT IS THE UNIVERSAL IMPRESSION THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS OBTAINED THROUGH THE DEEDS OF THE LAW
THIS SIN MERITS THE SEVEREST PUNISHMENT
OUR QUARREL IS WITH THOSE AMONG THEM WHO THINK THEY LIVE LIKE ANGELS CLAIMING THAT THEY DO NOT ONLY PERFORM THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF GOD BUT ALSO THE SAYINGS OF CHRIST AND MANY GOOD WORKS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXPECT OF THEM
PAUL ASSUMES THE ROLE OF A JUDGE AND CONDEMNS THE FALSE APOSTLES AS TROUBLERS OF THE GALATIANS
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE GOSPEL PROCLAIMED A CHRIST WHO HAD COME INTO THE WORLD TO SAVE SINNERS AND NOT THE RIGHTEOUS
THE FACT THAT THE MEDICINE IS BITTER IS NO FAULT OF THE PHYSICIAN
AS A STONE PRISON PROVES A PHYSICAL HANDICAP SO THE SPIRITUAL PRISON OF THE LAW PROVES A CHAMBER OF TORTURE
SUCH SINS HE USUALLY CALLS BY THEIR PROPER NAMES AS ADULTERY FORNICATION ETC

WE NEED A MILLSTONE AROUND OUR NECK TO KEEP US HUMBLE
OR WILL YOU BELIEVE THOSE GRAND APOSTLES WHO WERE SENT AND CONFIRMED BY CHRIST HIMSELF LONG BEFORE PAUL WHAT COULD PAUL SAY TO THAT
IN CALLING ME A SINNER SATAN YOU REALLY COMFORT ME ABOVE MEASURE WITH SUCH HEAVENLY CUNNING WE ARE TO MEET THE DEVIL'S CRAFT AND PUT FROM US THE MEMORY OF SIN
BUT DESIRE TO HAVE YOU CIRCUMCISED THAT THEY MAY GLORY IN YOUR FLESH
HE DOES NOT CHANGE THE VOICE OF THE LAW NOR DOES HE HIDE THE LAW WITH A VEIL
THE SILENCE IN THE CHURCH CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL HAS RESULTED IN UNTOLD HARM
THIS CONSIDERATION IS VERY MUCH NEEDED TO PUT A STOP TO THE SEVERITY OF SOME PASTORS WHO SHOW THE FALLEN NO MERCY
HENCE WE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED BY DEEDS OF LOVE
HE IS THE LIFEGIVER
LET THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL LEARN FROM PAUL HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE WHO HAVE SINNED
BARNABAS STUCK TO PAUL ON THIS POINT THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE GENTILES TO BE BOTHERED WITH THE LAW AS LONG AS THEY BELIEVED IN CHRIST
NOW THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE BELIEVERS ALWAYS OFFEND PEOPLE
THOUGH WE OR AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN PREACH ANY OTHER GOSPEL UNTO YOU THAN THAT WHICH WE HAVE PREACHED UNTO YOU LET HIM BE ACCURSED VERSE 13
THERE IS NO SIN WHICH ONE PERSON HAS COMMITTED THAT ANOTHER PERSON MAY NOT COMMIT IT ALSO WE STAND IN SLIPPERY PLACES
BRIEFLY AS LONG AS THE CHURCH PROCLAIMS THE DOCTRINE SHE MUST SUFFER PERSECUTION BECAUSE THE GOSPEL DECLARES THE MERCY AND GLORY OF GOD
THEY CRUCIFY THE FLESH WITH ITS EVIL DESIRES AND LUSTS BY FASTING AND EXERCISE AND ABOVE ALL BY A WALK IN THE SPIRIT
HE JUSTIFIED JOB
HE CHARGES THAT PERSON WITH THE ATROCITY OF CRUCIFYING ANEW THE SON OF GOD
WHERE IS THIS LIBERTY
YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DEVIL COULD BE SO GENTLE THE WORLD SO SWEET THE POPE SO GRACIOUS AND THE PRINCES SO CHARMING
