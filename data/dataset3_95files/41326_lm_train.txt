BUT YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU I DO MIND ANSWERED LESLIE
SHE DOES WORRY ME SO DREADFULLY SHE IS IN GREAT TROUBLE TOO SAID LESLIE
HA
HA
BUT YOU CANNOT HELP ME TO BEAR IT
LESLIE ASKED A FEW MORE QUESTIONS OF JANE WHO ALWAYS REPLIED IN A PLEASANT INTELLIGENT MANNER
LESLIE BEGAN TO REMARK ABOUT THEM
LOOK MARJORIE DO LOOK
IF SHE WILL CONFESS I THINK MR PARKER WILL FORGIVE HER BUT I CANNOT BE THE ONE TO RUIN HER WHOLE LIFE LESLIE STRUGGLED HARD TO REGAIN HER ORDINARY CALMNESS
I HATE TO HAVE ANYONE TOUCH MY HAIR BUT MYSELF
HOWEVER I WON'T THINK OF HER NOW
THIS VISIT HAS BEEN SO REFRESHING AND I LIKE YOU SO MUCH
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ADD TO THE TROUBLE OF EVERYBODY WHEN YOU GO ON IN THAT SILLY WAY
THE GIRLS LOOKING BRIGHT AND ENERGETIC OCCUPIED CORNER SEATS
SHE NEVER WROTE THAT LETTER MR PARKER'S FACE WORE AN UGLY SNEER
SO AS A RULE I AM CAREFUL TO SEE THAT IT IS A MORNING DRESS WHICH I AM ABOUT TO WEAR BUT DO YOU THINK EVENING DRESSES NECESSARY AT ALL SAID EILEEN IN AN ANXIOUS VOICE
THEY WERE ALWAYS CARELESS WITH REGARD TO THEIR DRESS AND WOULD NOT ALLOW MISS ROSS--OUR ENGLISH TEACHER WHO HAD US UNDER HER SPECIAL CARE--TO SPEND THE MONEY WHICH YOU SENT ON DRESS AT ALL AND DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT MISS ROSS CONSULTED THEM WELL AUNT HELEN THEY HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY WAY OF PLEADING THEIR OWN CAUSE
THAT THEY HAVE DETERMINED ON
ON THE LANDING A FAINT SMELL OF CARBOLIC AND EAU-DE-COLOGNE GREETED HER
YES CONTINUED BELLE
I WILL NEVER YIELD TO HIS ENTREATIES SO THOUGH HE BEGGED OF HER AND IMPLORED OF HER AND BULLIED HER AND FLATTERED HER THOUGH HE USED ALL HIS ELOQUENCE ANNIE REMAINED FIRM
BUT I AM BOUND TO BELIEVE THE WORDS OF A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOURSELF WOULD YOU REALLY CARE TO GO FOR A WALK MR PARKER YES MISS LESLIE
DON'T LET US TALK ANY MORE UNTIL THE MORNING ANNIE LAY DOWN ON HER BED TAKING THE CLOTHES AND WRAPPING THEM TIGHTLY ROUND HER
LETTIE STOOD WITHOUT
DO YOU MEAN IT OF COURSE I MEAN IT
I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR BROTHER IS STAYING
WHEN THIS THOUGHT CAME TO HER SHE PUT IT AWAY AT ONCE
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME AND AT ONCE
BUT ANNIE NOW RAN UP TO BELLE
I'LL RUN UP TO THIS DESOLATE ATTIC NOW AND THEN AND LOOK AFTER YOUR WARDROBE YOU WON'T
DEVOID OF CARE
YES WHEN YOU ARE THERE I SHALL DO MY UTMOST TO GUIDE YOU
I ENVY YOU YOUR POPULARITY I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM AT ALL WHAT YOU SAY
DEAR OLD MAMMY I HOPE SHE IS NOT TOO TIRED THERE IS SOMEONE COMING BACK WITH HER SAID KITTY
MRS ACHESON IS QUITE THE SWEETEST WOMAN I EVER MET
AND YOU ARE VERY TIRED SAID MR PARKER
THE CUPS AND SAUCERS TOO WERE OF RARE OLD CHINA AND OF A QUAINT PATTERN
OH CERTAINLY DEAR IF SHE WISHES IT
MEANWHILE MISS COLCHESTER AND LESLIE GILROY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR ROOM GAZED ONE AT THE OTHER
SHE THEN WENT BACK TO HER ROOM TO SLEEP AS BEST SHE COULD
HUG ME IN PUBLIC ANNIE
BUT OF COURSE WE ATTEND A GREAT MANY LECTURES AT THE MEN'S HALLS VERY IMPROPER INDEED YOUNG LADY
OH I LOVE HIM STILL
ALL NIGHT LONG I KEPT ASKING GOD TO SPARE EILEEN
YOU MUST LEAVE ME NOW RUPERT
BUT I KNEW YOU WOULD BE UP LEW AND I FELT THAT I MUST HAVE A TALK WITH YOU ALL RIGHT--THAT IS IF YOU REALLY WISH IT SAID LLEWELLYN SLIGHTLY STRETCHING HIMSELF AND A FROWN COMING BETWEEN HIS BROWS
I DID NOT APPROVE OF WHAT SHE SAID
NO ONE KNEW WHAT SHE SAW OR WHAT SHE FELT
SHE LEFT ANNIE'S WINDOW AND GOING TO HER OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM TOOK UP A NOVEL AND TRIED TO BURY HERSELF IN ITS CONTENTS
TURNED ASIDE TO ANNIE TO SAY I WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU MY DEAR PRESENTLY
FROM HER POCKET SHE EXTRACTED A LITTLE KEY FITTED IT INTO THE BOX AND OPENED IT
I MAY GET TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM HIS STANDPOINT IF I DON'T TAKE CARE
WELL MOTHER YOU ARE NOT AS YOUNG AS YOU USED TO BE
BUT I DON'T MIND YOUR KNOWING THAT I WASN'T REALLY ILL
SEVERAL OF THE COLLEGE GIRLS WERE OUT IN THEIR DIFFERENT BOATS
WON'T YOU KIDDY
HERE IS YOUR WRITING-TABLE
BUT IF THERE IS ANY WAY OUT OF ANY WAY TO LESSEN THE KIND OF SHOCK I GOT YESTERDAY I WILL BLESS YOU LESLIE GILROY TO THE LONGEST DAY I LIVE LESLIE AGAIN FELT AS IF SHE HAD GOT A DASH OF COLD WATER
ANNIE GAZED LONG AFTER HIS RETREATING FORM
IT WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF AFFECTATION FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE
LESLIE DID WHAT WAS REQUIRED
I AM DISAPPOINTED SHE SAT BACK IN HER SEAT AND DID NOT TROUBLE HERSELF TO GLANCE AT LESLIE FOR SOME TIME
THE WINDOWS OF THE THREE PRETTY ROOMS WERE A LITTLE OPEN
IF YOU WILL GIVE ME A SHEET OF PAPER I WILL WRITE A NOTE THE MAN HANDED HER ONE AND SHE SCRIBBLED A FEW WORDS
NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU MUST--YOU MUST MAKE RESTITUTION
DO YOU--DO YOU THINK HE WILL I CANNOT SAY
LET US ASK HIM TO SPARE HER LIFE MARJORIE STARED AT LESLIE THEN SHE CLUTCHED HOLD OF HER HAND SQUEEZED IT AND SAID EAGERLY
NOW DON'T LET US TALK OF ANYTHING SO VERY ELEMENTAL
HE WAS EXTREMELY COURTEOUS AND DEFERENTIAL AND MANAGED TO CONVEY A TOUCH OF ADMIRATION WHICH WAS NEVER UNDULY OBTRUSIVE
CERTAINLY MISS BRING YOUR FRIEND HE SPOKE IN A RESPECTFUL TONE AND USHERED THE GIRLS INTO A SMALL AND COMFORTABLY FURNISHED APARTMENT
BY THE WAY HAVE YOU SEEN THE CHETWYNDS SINCE THEY CAME DOWN NO I HEAR THAT EILEEN HAS TAKEN SOME DREADFUL DISEASE EXPLORING IN BACK SLUMS
SHE TOUCHED HIM ON THE ARM AND LOOKED INTO HIS FACE
LLEWELLYN WISHED HIMSELF FIFTY MILES AWAY
WE CAN BOTH SPEAK TO HER JANE HERIOT SLIPPED HER HAND THROUGH LESLIE'S ARM DREW HER UP THE ROOM TO WHERE MISS FRERE WAS TALKING TO A NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND THEN TOUCHED THE TUTOR ON THE ARM
HE PROMISED TO GIVE IT TO YOU IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN
I AM AN OLD WOMAN AND HAVE SEEN MUCH OF LIFE
THERE MY BOY JUST DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD OF COURSE I HAVE GOT SEVERAL OF LESLIE'S LETTERS ANSWERED LLEWELLYN
I AM RECITING AT THE PRESENT MOMENT A POEM FROM ONE OF OUR GREAT WRITERS
IT WAS BUT TO-DAY MISS LAUDERDALE I WAS SPEAKING OF THE MISERABLE DEAD SOULS WHICH MOST OF THE STUDENTS OF ST WODE'S CARRY WITHIN THEIR BREASTS HUSH
WHEN YOU ARE ALMOST INTOXICATED WITH THOSE GREAT AND STIMULATING THOUGHTS DOES NOT YOUR SOUL BURN DOES NOT YOU BRAIN SEEM TO EXPAND UNTIL IT ALMOST BURSTS NEVER SAID LESLIE
OH AUNT HELEN HOW PERFECTLY SWEET OF YOU SAID LETITIA AS SHE DANCED INTO HER OWN LITTLE ROOM
BUT I HAVE LITTLE HEART TO ADMIRE ANYTHING TO-DAY
THE CHANCE HAS BEEN OFFERED TO YOU AND THE CHANCE HAS BEEN OFFERED TO ME
HEAT COLD WORRY PAIN EVEN NOTHING MATTERS IF ONE CAN BUT GRASP THE RICHES OF THE PAST BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RICHES OF THE FUTURE BELLE
THOSE LIKE YOU WHO ARE CONDEMNED TO THE TRIAL OF REGULAR FEATURES BRIGHT EYES AND MASSES OF HAIR HAVE A STRUGGLE TO FULFIL THEIR PART WORTHILY IN LIFE'S BATTLE
HOW EXQUISITELY NEAT HOW SMART YOU LOOK NOT SMART AT ALL ONLY SUITABLY DRESSED REPLIED LETITIA BRIDLING A LITTLE
TEA CAME TO AN END PRESENTLY AND THEN THE CHILDREN IN ORDERLY FILE BEGAN TO REMOVE THE TEA-THINGS
PRESENTLY THE WORDS UTTERED BY THE GIRL REACHED LESLIE'S EARS
I DECLARE I AM GETTING QUITE MISERLY OVER THIS MATTER BELLE WENT TO THE OTHER END OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND FROM A DESK WHERE HER OWN SPECIAL TREASURES WERE KEPT TOOK A SQUARE DEAL BOX
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING I AM JUST GOING TO SPEND A WEEK WITH MRS ACHESON
WELL BLESS MY SOUL HE SAID
I AM SURE THAT I HAVE BEEN SENT TO THIS ROOM TO HELP YOU A LITTLE
DID SHE IMAGINE THAT YOU--YOU PRAYED
AT LAST THE SLOW EVENING CAME TO AN END
ALL HER LIFE UP TO THE PRESENT HAD BEEN BRIGHT
AT DINNER ANNIE CONTRARY TO HER WONT TALKED NOT ONLY WITH LESLIE BUT WITH THE OTHER GIRLS WHO SAT NEAR
WELL LETTIE DEAR AND HOW ARE YOU QUITE WELL THANK YOU AUNT HELEN REPLIED LETITIA IN HER CORRECT LADYLIKE VOICE
EILEEN AND I BOTH PROFESSED A LITTLE AND EILEEN THE DARLING WAS I BELIEVE IN EARNEST
SHE EAGERLY TURNED THE HANDLE
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING TERRIBLY SELFISH NOW DON'T BEGIN TO PREACH OLD GIRL
I FOLLOWED YOU HERE LESLIE SAID ANNIE
OH THAT SHE COULD CONFIDE IN MRS ACHESON
I AM CERTAIN MISS ACHESON HAS SOME FINE IDEAS
MRS CHETWYND FELT HER HEART SINKING LIKE LEAD IN HER BREAST
FIRST OF ALL LESLIE SHE ABSOLUTELY IMMURED HERSELF IN EILEEN'S ROOM REFUSED TO LEAVE IT DAY OR NIGHT AND DISTRACTED POOR AUNT HELEN AND THE NURSE AND NOW THAT SHE HAS COME OUT OF THE ROOM SHE IS DOING HER UTMOST TO MAKE HERSELF ILL DON'T SAY ANY MORE CRIED MARJORIE
ANNIE FELT ON THORNS AS SHE WATCHED THE TWO
NO I AM NOT GOING TO BE ANGRY
SHE ALSO HAD DREAMED ABOUT HER HOSTEL AND THE THOUGHT OF THE MONEY SHE HAD SAVED WAS REFLECTED IN HER FACE
SHE WAS AT ST WODE'S
WHEN I FINISH MY COLLEGIATE CAREER I SHALL HAVE QUITE ENOUGH TO OPEN MY HOSTEL
NOW I DON'T CARE A BIT ABOUT HAVING THINGS IN PERFECT ORDER BUT MARJORIE SAID EILEEN I HAVE BEEN READING UP ABOUT THAT LATELY AND I THINK YOU AND I OUGHT TO CULTIVATE ORDER VERY ASSIDUOUSLY IF WE MEAN TO BE REALLY USEFUL WOMEN
I MUST GO AT ONCE NOW TO DEAR ANNIE AND THANK HER I WISH YOU WOULD BELLE
I'LL BE BACK PRESENTLY SHE SEIZED A SMALL CLOTH CAP WHICH SHE WAS FOND OF WEARING AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM
I HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT I AM TO SAY TO THAT WOMAN I WILL WRITE THEN AT ONCE SAID LETTIE
WHAT AGONY I WENT THROUGH WHILE MARJORIE WAS PLAYING THAT FUGUE
I SCARCELY KNOW WHAT I FEEL
I COULD SCARCELY LIVE ON LESS THAN TWO SHILLINGS A DAY WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE EXACTLY A WEEK IN WHICH TO SPEND MY MONEY
ONLY I FELT CROSS AND I AM OWNING TO IT
THERE ARE SIX CHAIRS FOR INSTANCE
MEANWHILE THAT GOOD AND EXCELLENT WOMAN HAD TAKEN A FANCY TO THE FORLORN GIRL
I MEAN BY AND BY TO FOUND A NUNNERY ON A NEW LINE
SHE IS VERY ILL INDEED SHE ANSWERED
HER FACE WAS BURIED IN HER HANDS AND SHE WAS SIGHING IN A FEEBLE SORT OF FASHION
DON'T WORRY ANY MORE ABOUT THE FURNITURE SAID EILEEN
BUT AFTERWARDS I HAD TO GIVE HIM THE SACK
I LONG FOR THIS TIRESOME HOLIDAY TO BE AT AN END
I WANT ALL OF YOU CHILDREN TO BE PRESENT TOO
SHE KICKED OUT HER FOOT AND GAVE LETTIE A POKE
WE BOTH KNEW IT WAS ALL UP THEN ALTHOUGH SHE IMPLORED ME AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR TO MAKE CONFESSION
PRAY DON'T RING
IS THAT A FACT
FOR MR PARKER IS A MAN WHO NEVER GOES BACK ON HIS WORD
MR PARKER IMAGINES THAT I AM THE SORT OF GIRL WHO WILL GO INTO DEBT AND THEN COME TO HIM TO CLEAR ME
WHY SHOULD IT NOT HAVE A NICE PRETTY HOUSE TO LIVE IN
WHEN THE OLD BALLAD CAME TO AN END MRS CHETWYND FELT TEARS NOT FAR FROM HER EYES
I OUGHT NOT TO INTERFERE IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE BETTER FOR YOU TO SAY NOTHING MORE SAID MARJORIE IN HER GENTLE VOICE
I SHALL SEE TO HER HAVING A NICE MEAL TO-MORROW EVENING
HER HAIR WAS PUT UP TIDILY HER CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES WORE A BRIGHT AND YET CURIOUS EXPRESSION
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN
RUPERT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY TRYING TO BE AGREEABLE TO BELLE FOR A PURPOSE
BUT YOU MUST LOOK
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE THE MAN WHOM ANNIE LOVED WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN GOOD AND RESPECTABLE WHOSE MOTHER HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GENTLEST AND SWEETEST OF WOMEN WOULD STOOP AS LOW AS THIS
I AM SO THIRSTY I DON'T CARE ABOUT TEA TO-NIGHT REPLIED LESLIE
OF COURSE I SHALL WORK FOR SO MANY HOURS A DAY
ONE LITTLE SHOE NEAR THE FIREPLACE ONE NEAR THE WARDROBE
DO YOU KNOW HE SAID DROPPING INTO A CHAIR BY HER SIDE THAT YOU INTEREST ME IMMENSELY INDEED ANSWERED BELLE I AM RATHER SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU SAY SO
HER TONE WAS COLD
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE SERVANT APPEARED WITH A DAINTILY PREPARED TRAY CONTAINING TEA
BUT I HAVE HAD AN AWFUL STRUGGLE
LAST TIME I ATE WAS YESTERDAY EVENING SO YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M PRETTY PECKISH
BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IS UP
FIRES LIGHTED AND ALL
YOU WENT INTO DEBT FOR SIXTY POUNDS AND WERE AFRAID AND SENT THAT OTHER GIRL ANNIE COLCHESTER WHOSE SHOES YOU ARE NOT FIT TO BLACK FOR THE MONEY
I WILL CONSIDER THAT THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE TO-DAY IS NO LONGER BINDING
A PITY MOTHER
VERY WELL I WILL GO BACK TO MARJORIE NOW
I WILL SPEAK TO MISS MAPLE ABOUT YOU AND SHE WILL SEE YOU AFTER PRAYERS TO-MORROW LESLIE AND JANE HERIOT LEFT THE DINING HALL TOGETHER
BUT EVEN THERE SHE COULD NOT GET ANNIE OUT OF HER HEAD
THEY MET SEVERAL OF THEIR COMPANIONS WHO NODDED TO THEM KINDLY
LESLIE LAY DOWN WITHOUT MAKING ANY REMARK
I AM CUT UP A BIT THAT'S ALL
I HAVE EXCELLENT SIGHT YOU OUGHT TO BE REPEATED BELLE
IF I WERE TO TELL WHAT YOU DID AT WINGFIELD YOU COULD BE ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF FORGERY
YOU WILL BE APART FROM IT AND THAT IS NOT ACCORDING TO LESLIE GILROY'S IDEAS DEAR PRETTY LESLIE SAID BELLE WITH SUDDEN ENTHUSIASM
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK BUT DON'T LOCK ME OUT PLEASE ANNIE
AT ANY RATE DON'T KEEP ME NOW SHE SAID A SHIVER PASSING THROUGH HER FRAME
THEY WOULD ENTER SOCIETY UNDER THEIR MOTHER'S WING
AS TO THAT GIRL YOU ARE STAYING WITH ANYONE CAN TAKE HER IN
WILL YOU DO THIS FOR MY SAKE I DECLARE I'D DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD FOR YOU
THE CHETWYNDS SAY YOU ARE COMING BOATING WITH US YES REPLIED LESLIE
DO LOOK MARJORIE
YOU ARE--WHERE DID YOU SAY AT ST WODE'S COLLEGE WINGFIELD THE PLACE IN ALL ENGLAND WHERE WOMEN WHO WISH TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES OUGHT TO RECEIVE TRAINING THEN WOULD YOU RECOMMEND US TO COME TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE ASKED EILEEN
I FEEL SO DAZED SHE SAID
ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LESLIE DISTRESS NOW IN HER TONE
AND PROVIDED WE DON'T BREAK THE RULES WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO GET INTO HOT WATER
I DO THINK WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID TO YOU MOST TRULY AND SINCERELY
WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE DONE WRONG YOU STAND IN JENNY'S PLACE TO ME NOW
SHE WAS LOOKING HER BEST DRESSED NEATLY AND SUITABLY WITH HER WHITE SAILOR HAT MAKING AN EFFECTIVE CONTRAST TO THE MESHES OF HER BRIGHT GOLDEN HAIR
THE FOOTMAN SHUT THE DOOR AND GOT ON THE BOX BESIDE THE COACHMAN
THE MONEY IN THE BAGS AMOUNTED TO NEARLY NINETY POUNDS
THEY FOLLOWED ME ALL THROUGH THE YEARS
YOU WON'T GET YOUR HONORS AFTER ALL ARE YOU CERTAIN
THERE IS A CERTAIN MISS ACHESON WHO RESIDES IN NORTH HALL WHO HAS TOLD US OF SOME OF THE DISCOMFORTS AND FOR MY PART IF I HAD NOT PROMISED OH HUSH PLEASE LETTIE
AND ANNIE IS SORRY SO SORRY LESLIE'S KISSES FELL ON ANNIE'S HOT CHEEKS LIKE RAIN
MARJORIE WANTS YOU LESLIE
THEY SAY SHE IS RATHER BAD
IT WILL SUPPLY A LONG-FELT NEED BUT LESLIE WAS NOT IN THE HUMOR TO TALK ABOUT THE HOSTEL JUST THEN
CAN I SEE YOU AT ONCE AND BY YOURSELF CERTAINLY SAID LESLIE
BELLE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE ADVENTURES OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WAS CONSIDERABLY ANNOYED WHEN HER MOTHER RATTLED THE HANDLE OF THE LOCKED DOOR AND ASKED FOR ADMISSION
ALL THE SAME I HAVE GOT SUCH A HEADACHE THAT I CAN SCARCELY STAND UP WELL I AM GLAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANY MORE WORK TO-NIGHT WORK SAID ANNIE
WELL DEAR IF THE BOX HAD BEEN STOLEN HOW DISAPPOINTED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FIND ONLY ORDINARY COINS
ANNIE SOON BECAME INTERESTED
IT SEEMS TO RUN IN OUR BLOOD--I MEAN THE CAPACITY FOR THIEVING
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THEY REACHED MARJORIE'S DOOR THAT BELLE SPOKE
I BELIEVE THEY ARE GOING OUT FOR A WALK
DO YOU THINK I LOVE YOU NOW
TELL US EVERYTHING
THE ONLY ONE I LOVE IN ALL THE WORLD
AND MARJORIE AND EILEEN IN PARTICULAR FELT THEIR HEARTS GLOWING AND THEIR EYES SPARKLING
YOU ARE QUITE THE SWEETEST GIRL IN THE COLLEGE AND SO WE ALL SAY
IF YOU HAD TAKEN A FIRST I KNOW A FELLOW WHO WOULD HAVE LENT ME TWENTY POUNDS ON THE STRENGTH OF YOUR GETTING A GOOD POST
THE HERO IS REQUIRED TO SPEND A WHOLE YEAR IN THE ISOLATED HOUSE WHICH ACCORDING TO HIS GRANDFATHER'S WILL SHALL THEN BECOME HIS
THEN WE SHALL GET ON TOGETHER LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE
BUT IT IS NOT YOUNG WITH ME FOR I THINK I AM OLDER THAN MY YEARS
AND FOR THE FEW THAT ONLY LEND THEIR EAR THAT FEW IS ALL THE WORLD
IF YOU CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM YOU WOULD INDEED BE MY GREATEST FRIEND ON EARTH BUT NO NO THOUGHT ANNIE I CANNOT CONFIDE IN HER
AND YOU ARE PERSONALLY VERY DESIROUS ABOUT THIS SAID MR PARKER
BUT THERE ARE WAYS AND MEANS OF HELPING AN HONEST LAD AND I AM NOT THE ONE TO SHIRK MY DUTY
BUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I AM NOT THINKING OF LITERATURE NOR OF COLLEGE LIFE AT ALL
BUT BE SURE LESLIE YOU DON'T MENTION THAT I WAS OUT PART OF THE TIME I SHALL NOT VOLUNTEER THE INFORMATION ANSWERED LESLIE
YOU LOOK SWEET SAID ANNIE
CEASE TO FRET ABOUT MERE EXTERNALS
EACH HAS AN IDEAL WHICH WILL NEVER BE QUITE REALIZED ON EARTH
THE GIRLS ARE EDUCATED AND ARE COMING HOME FOR GOOD SAID MRS ACHESON
NO YOUNG LADIES FROM MY HOUSE MUST GO NEAR SUCH A PLACE DEAR ME MOTHER WHY NOT SAID EILEEN
I AM WORKING FOR HONORS I TOLD YOU WELL WELL
EILEEN AND MARJORIE WHO BOTH ROWED WELL TOOK THE OARS
IT IS DOWNRIGHT SINFUL WASTE SAID MARJORIE FROWNING AS SHE SPOKE
JANE RATTLED THE HANDLE IMPATIENTLY
I AM SOMETIMES INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT I DID WRONG TO SHIELD YOU WRONG TO SHIELD ME
BUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE TWENTY GIRLS ARE TO BE DISAPPOINTED FOR I AM TO BE THE SUCCESSFUL ONE
NOW THEN MOTHER GET INTO YOUR OWN SPECIAL CHAIR AND TELL US THE NEWS SAID LESLIE.--"LLEWELLYN YOU ARE NOT GOING AWAY ARE YOU NO SAID LLEWELLYN
SHE ADORED MUSTY PROFESSORS AND NEVER HAD A GOOD WORD TO SAY FOR AN ATHLETIC MAN
BE SURE YOU PUT THAT IN THE BOYS AND GIRLS CHATTED EAGERLY ONE TO THE OTHER
I MAY HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO SAY TO BELLE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT STAY IF YOU WISH TO SAID BELLE
ARE YOU TO BE MADE SUB-EDITOR ON ONE OF THE GREAT DAILIES
THEN I SHALL NOT ALWAYS WORK AT A POUND A WEEK
THE RESULT OF OUR INTERVIEW IS THIS SHE SAID LOOKING ROUND AT HER CHILDREN AND LAYING HER HAND ON LESLIE'S ARM
BUT HUNT WILL DO THE THING IN ANY WAY YOU WISH AND HE WON'T SEND IN THE ACCOUNT UNTIL THE END OF TERM
IT IS THE DREAM OF MY LIFE NO LONGER HE SAID
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED LETTIE TOOK IT FROM THE ROOM
IT IS ALL RIGHT RUPERT CRIED ANNIE
HOW MY TEMPLES DO BEAT SHE SAID WITH A SORT OF A SOB AND MY LEGS ARE ICY UP TO MY KNEES AND DRINK THIS COLD WATER TO BEGIN WITH SAID LESLIE
ANNIE HAD GOT INTO A SCRAPE ALREADY IN NOT ATTENDING THE MEETING AT EAST HALL
IT WAS NOW NEAT AND BARE
IT'S POSITIVELY WRONG OF YOU TO DECEIVE MOTHER IN THE WAY YOU ARE DOING LETITIA LOOKED GENTLY REPROACHFUL
HE WANTS YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR PRESENT EMPLOYMENT IMMEDIATELY AND TO GO TO EITHER OF THESE PLACES AT THE BEGINNING OF TERM
YOU MUST ALL HEAR MY GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS MOTHER
IT IMMEDIATELY MADE A PLACE FOR ITSELF
HE RETURNED TO LONDON BY THE 5.30 LESLIE WONDERED THAT ANNIE DID NOT TAKE ALARM WHEN SHE HEARD THAT HER VISITOR HAD COME FROM LONDON
MY MONEY IS CONTINUING TO HEAP UP
SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AND LOOKED EXCITED
LESLIE SHE SAID LAYING HER HAND ON HER ELDEST GIRL'S ARM MY NEWS HAS TO DO WITH YOU
I AM FOND OF BALLADS
HE MUST KNOW
VERY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS MONEY I HAVE SAVED FROM MY COLLEGE EXPENSES FOR A NOBLE PURPOSE
LLEWELLYN RUBBED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES
SHE IS MY DEAR HUSBAND'S YOUNGER BROTHER'S CHILD
BY-BY MRS CHETWYND POOR MRS ACHESON CAST ANXIOUS EYES OF MISERY AND COMMISERATION AT HER FRIEND AND WAS HURLED OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE EMPHATIC BELLE
TO ENLARGE THE BRAIN TO CULTIVATE THE HEAR
HE THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE LEFT US BETTER OFF HE HAD NO RIGHT TO ASK ABOUT OUR FATHER'S MEANS GRUMBLED LLEWELLYN
SHE IS JUST HERE IN THE NICK OF TIME
DO YOU THINK FOR ONE SINGLE INSTANT I WANT YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM OTHER THAN WHAT I AM--A GIRL NAY A WOMAN WHOSE AIM IN LIFE IS TO DIG DEEP INTO THE VAST MINES OF THE MIGHTY PAST THOSE GREAT MINES WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT TO US BY THE DEAD AND GONE
DO YOU IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT I AM A LIAR
IT IS AN ORDER FROM MISS LAUDERDALE
AND YOU WILL BE POPULAR TOO SAID FLORRIE SMART
LESLIE LOOKED AT ANNIE WITH A SORT OF SUPPRESSED EAGERNESS
SHE HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY AND THE MERE IDLE CHATTER OF THIS HAPPY FAMILY PASSED OVER HER EARS UNNOTICED
EILEEN RAN INTO THE HOUSE
NOW LESLIE DON'T BE TEMPTED IN THAT WAY AGAIN
SHE WENT UP TO MARJORIE
IF YOU GO IN DEBT AGAIN WHY THERE I WON'T HELP YOU
VERY WELL
I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND
HOW PUZZLING THESE MODERN SCIENTIFIC NAMES ARE LETTIE SANK INTO AN EASY CHAIR AND INVITED LESLIE TO ONE BY HER SIDE
WE ARE ONLY INTERRUPTING YOUR WORK NOW I WAS RESTING WHEN YOU ARRIVED SAID BELLE
IT IS ALL SETTLED SIR
DON'T GO INTO DEBT FOR IT THAT'S ALL I NEVER WILL SAID POOR LESLIE
BUT SHE MUST DO IT
I WISH I COULD FEEL AS SURE OF TAKING HONORS BY AND BY IN LITERATURE
BUT NOW ALL THAT IS KNOCKED ON THE HEAD AND BY YOUR LAZINESS
BUT HE IS REALLY GETTING VERY FOND OF HER AND ACTUALLY ASKS HER ADVICE ON SEVERAL MATTERS IN THE MOST UNWARRANTABLE AND UNBUSINESSLIKE MANNER
THERE WAS ALARM AND INCREDULITY IN HIS GLANCE
MISS GILROY IS COMING AND WE SHALL MAKE QUITE A COZY PARTY EILEEN AND MARJORIE SAID THEY WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO COMPLY AND THE GIRLS WENT UPSTAIRS SIDE BY SIDE
THERE WAS NO REPLY THE STEPS WENT A LITTLE FASTER AND THE GROANS CAME OFTENER THEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS FELL UPON LESLIE'S EARS
THE MORE ABSTRUSE THE MORE DRY THE SCIENCE THE MORE EAGERLY DID BELLE ABSORB IT AND MAKE IT PART OF HERSELF
MISS LAUDERDALE WILL BE VERY ANGRY WITH ANYONE WHO DOES NOT ATTEND THAT'S JUST IT JANE
YOU WILL ONLY GET YOURSELF INTO TROUBLE AND THERE IS SURELY NO USE IN THAT
BUT WHAT IS IT I WANT YOU TO DO THIS
I WANT YOU TO LET HER DO IT AND YOU INTEND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CHARACTER HER CHARACTER
MY DEAR LETTIE SHE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD GO UP TO MARJORIE FOR I CANNOT QUIET HER
LESLIE STARTED UP IMPULSIVELY
OH YOU'D KNOW VERY WELL IF YOU HAD SUFFERED
EITHER TRUTH GOODNESS VIRTUE ARE NOT STILL THE SELF-SAME WHICH THEY ARE AND ALWAYS ONE BUT ALTER TO THE PROJECT OF OUR WILL
I MUST LIVE WHILE I AM WAITING FOR A SITUATION
OH WHAT A DARLING
PLENTY OF BRAINS THERE AND YOUR EYES ARE CLEAR AND DANCING WITH INTELLIGENCE
BELLE WAS IN A DARK-BROWN ZEPHYR DRESS MADE IN THE SIMPLEST FASHION AND A LEATHER BELT ENCIRCLED HER WAIST
HE IS A VERY RICH CITY MERCHANT
WELL MARJORIE HAVE IT OUT WITH THE DEAR MAMMY FOR I MUST GO AT ONCE TO SEE FOWLER'S LAST BABY
I SEE BY MISS GILROY'S FACE THAT SHE DOES LESLIE NODDED AND SMILED
I'LL RUN UP TO MISS COLCHESTER'S ROOM AND FIND OUT IF SHE IS IN LETTIE AND MARJORIE REMAINED ON THE SWEEP OF GRAVEL OUTSIDE THE HALL
THE SOCIAL EXISTENCE THE GAMBLING IN STOCKS AND PRODUCE THE CHARACTERISTIC LIFE IN CHICAGO FORM A BACKGROUND FOR AN EXCEEDINGLY VIGOROUS AND HUMAN TALE OF MODERN LIFE AND LOVE
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT RUPERT THAT YOU WILL LEAVE ANNIE ALONE IN THE FUTURE CONTINUED LESLIE
TRY AND KEEP QUIET ANNIE AND ALLOW ME TO SPEAK CONTINUED LESLIE
WHAT IS UP MY DEAR--WHAT IS UP WHAT IS UP CRIED LESLIE
I DECLARE NOW AND I SHALL ALWAYS MAINTAIN IT THAT YOU ARE THE NOBLEST GIRL IN THE WORLD BUT ANNIE DO YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND
THE MEAL WAS A GOOD ONE AND NICELY SERVED
PLEASE KEEP A RIGHT GOOD TEA FOR ME
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON CAPITALLY SAID LETTIE
AFTER ALL SHE IS MY SISTER THE MORE SHAME ON YOU TO GET YOUR SISTER INTO TROUBLE
MR PARKER LOOKED AT THE TWO
PRICE 75 CENTS PER VOLUME POSTPAID
PRICE 75 CENTS PER VOLUME POSTPAID
ALL THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO BECOME MEMBERS OF OUR NEW LEAGUE WHICH IS TO BE CALLED THE GUILD OF ST ELIZABETH CAN DO SO
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT HOWEVER
BUT WHEN HE GLANCED AT LESLIE WHO TALL STRAIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL STOOD BEFORE HIM A SPASM CROSSED HIS FACE AND HIS VOICE FALTERED
WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW WAS QUITE RIGHT EILEEN
AND WON'T BE AT ALL TOO WARM OH I CAN'T BE BOTHERED SAID HESTER SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS
IT IS A GREAT CHANCE
SHE SEEMED PARTLY TO GUESS ALREADY WHAT WAS COMING
I WILL GO OF COURSE BUT I WARN YOU I SHAN'T BE THE LEAST SCRAP OF USE
WELL NOW STOP WRANGLING YOU THREE SAID BELLE AND LET ME SPEAK
PERHAPS I SHOULD GIVE UP MY WHOLE LIFE TO MY BEAUTIFUL FACE AND SPEND ALL MY TIME DEVISING MEANS TO MAKE IT STILL MORE ATTRACTIVE DON'T SAID LESLIE IN A SHARP VOICE
I FEEL NUMB ALL OVER
BE CHEERFUL LESLIE AND GET ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN OUT OF THIS MAGNIFICENT THING FOR I DON'T PRETEND THAT IT'S NOT A GREAT BIT OF FORTUNE FOR YOU
CERTAINLY NOT
NOW LESLIE HAD NOT FAILED TO REMARK THAT ANNIE SELDOM OR NEVER GOT LETTERS THAT SHE HAD MADE NO REAL FRIENDS IN THE COLLEGE AND THAT AS FAR AS SHE COULD TELL SHE SEEMED TO HAVE NO SPECIAL FRIEND ANYWHERE
EVEN THE DOCTORS HAVE DECEIVED ME
HE LOOKED HARD AT LESLIE THEN HE LOOKED AWAY
I AM CALLED INKY ANNIE I RATHER GLORY IN THE NAME BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A MATHEMATICAL SCHOLAR WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ESSENCE OF ORDER SAID LESLIE
THERE IS A GREAT A TERRIBLE REASON WHY I MUST SUCCEED
BELLE STARED AT HER MOTHER THROUGH HER GLASSES AND AGAIN DID NOT REPLY
YOU WILL HAVE TO PASS IN RESPONSIONS
HE LIKED HER
THEN ANNIE SAID IN A GASPING SORT OF VOICE
I FEEL THAT BY AND BY WE SHALL BE FRIENDS
I CAN READ CHARACTER WELL ENOUGH AND YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME THE TRUTH WITH REGARD TO THAT MONEY
THE GIRLS WHO HAD INVITED THEM LOOKED SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED
THEN THAT IS A RELIEF
SHE SPENDS A GREAT DEAL OF HER TIME OUT BUT SHE HAS TRAINED MY SISTERS AND MYSELF I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE GOING TO QUOTE THAT AWFUL PROVERB ABOUT A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING SAID MISS COLCHESTER
ARE YOU CRYING MOTHER SHE SAID GOING UP TO HER MOTHER
I COULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO THROW IT AWAY
WE HAD A BAD TIME BUT IT WAS OVER SOON
HER EYES ARE CLOSED FOR THE PRESENT AND SHE IS ONLY MUTTERING TO HERSELF
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE WIDOW HAD GONE BACK TO HER ROOM THAT SHE REMEMBERED HOW VERY STRANGE IT WAS THAT ANNIE SHOULD HAVE LOCKED THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR HOW STILL STRANGER IT WAS FOR ANNIE TO BE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AT ALL
THERE ARE TWENTY BOATS BELONGING TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE
HIS HAIR HAD BEEN CUT HIS FACE WAS CLEAN-SHAVEN
SHE WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN UPRIGHT RESPECTABLE AND RESPECTED
HE WON'T GIVE ME THE POST THOUGH BECAUSE HE DOES NOT LIKE ME WELL ENOUGH
WATER WAS SUPPLIED AND THE YOUNG LADY TOOK A COPIOUS DRAUGHT
SHE WANTS TEA
IT IS A CHANCE WHICH MAY NEVER COME IN YOUR WAY AGAIN BUT I DON'T WANT IT SHE CRIED TOUCHED TO HER VERY HEART'S CORE BY SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE
YOU MUST LET ME TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BE A FATHER TO YOU
NO SHOW OR PRETENSION OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
WODE'S BY MRS
PLEASE DON'T WAIT ANOTHER MOMENT LETTIE LEFT THE ROOM AND MRS CHETWYND STARED AT LESLIE
HE IS TERRIBLY TOUCHED BY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
YES INJURE HER AND TAKE AWAY THE FAINT CHANCE THERE MAY BE OF HER LIFE BUT YOU CANNOT MEAN THAT LESLIE
BUT THE MAIN THING IS TO WRITE TO MISS LAUDERDALE
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT
YOU COULD SPEAK TO MR PARKER
I NEED NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS JUST NOW
IF I COULD BUT TELL HER THE TRUTH THOUGHT THE POOR GIRL
SHE MADE NO OTHER REPLY OF ANY SORT
YOU WERE VERY ILL
WHY DO YOU SPEAK IN THAT WAY
BE QUICK LESLIE QUICK I WANT TO SEE MR PARKER ON THAT VERY SUBJECT REPLIED LESLIE
HE HAD A HEMSTITCHED HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POCKET WITH A SLIGHT SCENT ABOUT IT
HE WORE A FROCK-COAT OF THE NEWEST CUT HIS TIE WAS IMMACULATE SO WERE HIS COLLAR AND CUFFS
SHE WAS ADDRESSING LETITIA WHO WAS GRADUALLY GETTING HERSELF MORE AND MORE INTO THE GOOD WOMAN'S CONFIDENCE
MRS ACHESON HOPES YOU ARE QUITE RESTED MISS
AT A MOMENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE CANNOT THINK OF SUBLUNARY MATTERS DO GO ON SAID BELLE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY THEN WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN GOOD-BY RUPERT GOOD-BY
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT HIS LATCHKEY INTO THE DOOR WHEN THE MERCHANT'S HEARTY VOICE ARRESTED HIM
THERE ALWAYS IS A FAILURE IN EVERY FAMILY ISN'T THERE MOTHER
IT IS SOMETHING WHICH I MUST NOT TELL TO ANYONE
I WILL HELP YOU OF COURSE BELLE IF I CAN
SHE IS FULL OF EARNESTNESS
I KNOW IT TO BE A FACT
NO ANNIE
THEN LET US RETURN TO THE HOUSE SAID LESLIE
IF I WENT TO OXFORD I COULD NOT EARN ANY MONEY FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS
THERE IS THE DOOR--GO I WISH YOU'D LET ME MEND YOUR DRESS FIRST SAID LETTIE WHIPPING A NEAT LITTLE HOUSEWIFE OUT OF HER POCKET AND PREPARING TO THREAD A NEEDLE
THE DAY IS SUCH A SULTRY ONE HOT SAID BELLE IS IT
WELL IF IT WERE ONLY DEBT--THE ORDINARY GIRLISH WISH TO POSSESS HERSELF OF FAL-LALS AND FINERY--WHY I COULD FORGIVE THE CHILD
ANNIE DRAGGED HER COMPANION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BOAT-HOUSE
BUT IF YOU REFUSE I WILL SPEAK TO OH DON'T
HOW IS EILEEN MARJORIE
HOW SPLENDID OF HER
OH MOTHER PLEASE DO ALLOW US TO DRESS AS WE LIKE
I HOPE TO GOODNESS SHE WON'T BE IN
IT WOULD BE WRONG CRUEL MONSTROUS FOR EILEEN BEAUTIFUL EILEEN TO DIE
YOU WILL WHEN YOU COME TO LIVE WITH ME
CHAPTER XXIV THE TWINS
BUT I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND YOU MUST HAVE FAITH MY BOY
YOU WILL SEE HALF OF US TO-NIGHT AND HALF OF US TO-MORROW
THINK HOW AWFUL IT IS TO CARRY WITHIN YOUR BREAST A DEAD SOUL YES
BUT I DON'T MIND HOW LONG I WAIT UP IF I CAN REALLY HELP YOU YOU CANNOT HELP ME
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
COME ALONG TAKE MY ARM
WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED
WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED
WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN FOR HER
I ONLY TRUST THEY WON'T JOIN THE ODDITIES
SHE DID SO OPENING THE DOOR OF MARJORIE'S ROOM FIRST
HOW HAPPY WE SHALL BE
HE TOOK ME UP TO SEE HIS FATHER AND HIS FATHER WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR A BOY JIM LIKED
YOUR SISTER BY WRITING SUCH A LETTER COMMITTED FORGERY ANNIE UTTERED A DEEP GROAN AND COVERED HER FACE
IT HAS COME SHE CRIED
WELL IF I DON'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING MY NAME'S NOT CHARLES PARKER
ONCE OR TWICE SHE DROPPED HER PEN
HERE SHE HERSELF WAS IN COMPLETE SHADOW BUT THE MOON RIDING HIGH IN THE HEAVENS MADE A SILVER BAND OF LIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER
I BELIEVE--YES I CANNOT HELP BELIEVING--THAT SOMEHOW THE GIRL IS INNOCENT
WHY WILL YOU KEEP ON PRYING AND FUSSING AND INTERFERING
I WOULD NOT LIKE YOU TO BE MY JUDGE AT THE GREAT ASSIZE YOU MUST NOT TALK TO ME IN THAT TONE SAID LESLIE STUNG IN HER TURN
IT STOOD IN ITS OWN SPACIOUS GROUNDS AND CONSISTED OF FOUR LARGE BUILDINGS WHICH WERE CALLED RESPECTIVELY THE NORTH THE SOUTH THE EAST AND THE WEST HALLS
PRESENTLY SHE STOOD ON THE LITTLE QUAY JUST OUTSIDE THE BOAT-HOUSE
IF YOU HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED SUCH A VALUABLE HELP TO THE SPENDING OF YOUR TIME LET ME RECOMMEND YOU TO DO SO WITHOUT DELAY
A SERVANT APPROACHED BELLE WITH A TRAY BUT SHE WAVED IT ASIDE
OH BY THE WAY MRS ACHESON GAVE ME A MESSAGE FOR YOU
WITH HIS TOIL WITH THE ENERGY OF HIS STRONG YOUNG ARMS WITH THE YOUTH AND TALENTS WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN HIM HE WAS SUPPORTING HIS MOTHER AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
AND AT ANY RATE SHE IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER FORTY OH SHE IS MORE THAN MIDDLE-AGED
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE CAN WASTE TIME IN TRYING TO LEAD THE EXISTENCE OF THE ANCHORITE AS WELL AS IN ENDEAVORING TO SURROUND ONE'S SELF WITH LUXURIES ONE THING AT LEAST WE WILL PROMISE YOU BELLE--WE ARE NOT GOING IN FOR ANY EXTRAS--NO PICTURES NOR KNICK-KNACKS FOR US THANK HEAVEN SAID BELLE WITH A DEEP SIGH
PERHAPS IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF LESLIE AND WHAT LESLIE ENDURED THROUGH ANNIE'S FORMER ILL-DOING
SHE ENJOYED HER WORK AND NEVER COMPLAINED
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY CHILDREN RANGING FROM LESLIE THE ELDEST GIRL AGED NINETEEN TO LITTLE DAN AGED TWO
YOU SHALL COME HOME WITH ME WITH YOU
WHEN EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER MABEL SOUNDED THE GONG AND LLEWELLYN CAME DOWN
ON HIS ARRIVAL THIS MORNING HE LOOKED EAGERLY THROUGH HIS CORRESPONDENCE AND HAD JUST TAKEN UP THE LETTER FROM THE EXPERT AND WAS READING ITS CONTENTS WHEN HIS CLERK ENTERED SAID THAT MISS COLCHESTER HAD CALLED THAT SHE LOOKED IN SERIOUS TROUBLE AND WISHED TO SEE MR PARKER WITHOUT DELAY
IF YOU CONTEMPLATE MARRIAGE YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME SO AT ONCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HER MISERY ANNIE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING
I MEAN TO KEEP MY LIBERTY AND HAVE A JOLLY GOOD USEFUL TIME AND SO DO I SAID EILEEN
YOUR MOTHER WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO INVITE ME AND I AM AS UP TO A BIT OF FROLIC AS IF I WERE AS YOUNG AS YOU
LESLIE HAD TO STRAIN HER EARS TO CATCH THE WORDS
SHE MIGHT GATHER SOME STRENGTH DURING THESE FEW DAYS FOR THE SOLITARY AND MISERABLE TIME WHICH LAY BEFORE HER
DO YOU UNDERSTAND I SHALL CERTAINLY KEEP MY PART OF THE ROOM TIDY SAID LESLIE WITH SOME SPIRIT
NOW WHERE CAN WE GO FOR A REAL GOOD TALK I DON'T KNOW THIS PART OF LONDON REPLIED ANNIE
I WASN'T ILL THEN SHE LAUGHED IN A QUEER STRAINED WAY
BUT CAN'T WE GO DOWNSTAIRS AS WE ARE PERHAPS YOU'LL MEND THIS BRAID SAID EILEEN IF YOU PREFER THAT TO CUTTING IT OFF WHICH IS MUCH QUICKER I WOULD SUGGEST MISS THAT YOU LET ME CHOOSE YOUR DRESS
LET US CONSIDER THE CHARMING PICTURE WHICH LIES BEFORE US
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW MY ROOM IS FURNISHED LETITIA GAVE A PERCEPTIBLE SHUDDER AND WALKING TO THE WINDOW DELIBERATELY SHUT IT
I CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT IT SHE STOPPED ABRUPTLY
AND SO THIS IS THE YOUNG LADY
HAD YOU DONE SO I MUST HAVE CUT YOU DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER NARROW OF YOU SAID MARJORIE
WE OUGHT TO BE IN THE HOUSE NOW
I DISAGREE WITH MISS FRERE IN TOTO
GOOD-TEMPERED AND GOOD-HEARTED BUT WITH A CERTAIN STUBBORN ELEMENT ABOUT THEM WHICH CAUSED THEM NOT TO DISOBEY BUT TO HAVE THEIR DESIRES ON ALMOST EVERY POINT GRATIFIED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE TROUBLE OF OPPOSING THEM WAS IMMENSE
COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN IN THE AFTERNOON
HAS SHE GONE ASKED MARJORIE STILL KEEPING HER FACE HIDDEN
WE CAN TALK OVER--OVER WHAT YOU MEAN I AM SURE I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT CAN BE WHEN I COME BACK WE MUST TALK NOW CRIED LESLIE
I DO NOT INTEND TO BETRAY HER
WE MUST ONLY WAIT AND SEE THE GIRLS RETIRED TO BED
WE SHALL ALL HAVE A MOST UNENVIABLE POSITION THAT I CAN FORETELL
IN A YEAR'S TIME MY SCREW IS TO BE RAISED
ANOTHER BOY WOULD HAVE HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR HIS MOTHER TO CLASP BUT LLEWELLYN'S LONG HANDS HUNG BETWEEN HIS KNEES
PRAY DON'T RUSH AT ME AND DEVOUR ME WITH KISSES
I WANT SIXTY POUNDS
BUT I THINK PERHAPS YOUR FORTE WILL BE MODERN LANGUAGES AND ENGLISH LITERATURE
THERE'S THAT MOTHER OF HERS THE BEST OF GOOD WOMEN AND THAT NOBLE YOUNG FELLOW HER BROTHER AND THE REST OF EM
OH I CANNOT EXPLAIN THINGS NOW AND I KNOW YOU MUST THINK DREADFULLY OF ME I SEE YOU ARE CONCEALING SOMETHING SAID PARKER KNITTING HIS BROWS AND GIVING HER ANOTHER FIXED LOOK
SHE WILL BE GOING OUT PRESENTLY THOUGHT THE GIRL
DID I NOT TELL YOU SHE WAS AN ODDITY NOW LETTIE SAID EILEEN IN AN IMPLORING VOICE DON'T LAUGH AT POOR BELLE
CHAPTER XIV--A COCOA PARTY--CONTINUED
I DO SHE SAID
HE IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD I PASSIONATELY LOVE
WAS FAITH THE FIRST REAL FAITH SHE HAD EVER KNOWN TRULY VISITING HER HEART AND HELPING HER THROUGH THIS DARK HOUR OF TRIBULATION
I AM GOING TO HAVE MY OWN WAY AND NOBODY SHALL INTERFERE
NOW I HAVE
HER JACKET HAD ALREADY TUMBLED ON TO THE FLOOR BUT SHE HAD NOT OBSERVED IT
HE STOOD UP AND THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN
YOU WON'T GET THE POST YOU COVET UNLESS THE TRUTH IS KNOWN I CANNOT DO IT SAID ANNIE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER PRAYERS SHE HAD TO ATTEND A LECTURE IN WINGFIELD
BY THE WAY WHERE ARE YOU STAYING SHE ASKED TURNING AGAIN TO ANNIE
BY THE FIRST POST IN THE MORNING SHE RECEIVED A LETTER
WE ARE IN DREADFUL TROUBLE ABOUT HER
YOUR MOTHER SHALL NEVER KNOW NOR THAT BRAVE BROTHER OF YOURS
HERE I AM HERE I AM AS I PROMISED CALLED OUT THE FORMER RUBBING HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE AND PUSHING UP HIS RED HAIR FROM HIS ALMOST AS RED FOREHEAD
BY THE WAY LESLIE YOU DON'T LOOK TOO BRIGHT YOURSELF
PUT THEM DOWN PLEASE PORTER--THERE NEAR THE DOOR
I WILL COME TO-MORROW TO FIND OUT
WHY WAS IT MY LOT TO HAVE YOU SENT TO SHARE MY ROOM--YOU WHO ARE THE VERY PINK OF NEATNESS I SEE YOU ARE VERY SORRY TO HAVE ME AND OF COURSE I AM SORRY TOO THAT YOU SHOULD BE PUT OUT SAID LESLIE WHO THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS
OF COURSE I INTENDED TO DO SO TO-NIGHT
BUT SHE IS NOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HER BROTHER'S SINS DID I EVER SAY SHE WAS NO
MRS CHETWYND GLANCED AT THEM AND DESPAIR ENTERED HER SOUL
IF IT DID I SHOULD FEEL VERY MUCH ALARMED ABOUT MYSELF BELLE UTTERED A SIGH
I AM ONLY SORRY THAT MISS COLCHESTER IS NOT A LITTLE MORE TIDY
SHE RAN UPSTAIRS PUT ON HER HAT TOOK UP HER GLOVES AND WENT OUT
DON'T PREJUDICE MISS GILROY AGAINST HER
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING MORE SHE SAID IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE
BUT SO DAINTILY SO EXQUISITELY WITH SUCH A CAREFUL EYE TO THE SMALLEST DETAILS THAT MARJORIE AND EILEEN LOOKED ROUGH AND GAUCHE BESIDE HER
COME WITH ME DO MARJORIE TRY NOT TO BE SUCH A HUMBUG SAID LETTIE IN AN ALMOST CROSS VOICE
PLEASE GET INTO YOUR OWN BED NOW FOR I DO NOT MEAN TO SLEEP UNTIL I SEE YOU COMFORTABLE AND I AM DEAD TIRED ANNIE OPENED HER RED-BROWN EYES VERY SLOWLY AND FIXED THEM ON LESLIE'S FACE
BUT I WILL TELL YOU NOW INSTEAD
BELLE ACHESON WILL BE WITH US
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MISS GILROY
I QUITE UNDERSTAND SHE SAID
IT WILL BE THE FINEST THING IN ALL THE WORLD FOR HER SIMPLY THE MAKING OF HER LLEWELLYN'S FACE ONCE MORE LOOKED DOWNCAST
AND ADDED THE MAN GLANCING AT THE BOY AND GIRL JUST THE SORT OF CHILDREN TOO THE TWO CHILDREN THUS ALLUDED TO COULD NOT HELP SIGHING
ANNIE WAS STANDING JUST WHERE SHE WAS WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE LETTER
HE STILL WORE THE IMMACULATE FROCK-COAT AND LOOKED QUITE THE HANDSOME SMART YOUNG MAN OF THE WORLD
IT IS SO DELICIOUS MARJORIE WHEN IT NESTLES UP AGAINST YOU THE TRAIN SLACKENED SPEED DREW UP AT A GREAT STATION AND THE WOMAN THE BABY AND MOST OF THE OTHER PASSENGERS GOT OUT
WELL THAT IS ALL RIGHT SAID BELLE SLIGHTLY MOLLIFIED
DO YOU WISH FOR AN EXPLANATION
THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A COLD WIND BLOWING AND I HAD TO WALK HALF THE WAY AS EVERY OMNIBUS WAS FULL
YOU WANT REST AND GOOD NOURISHMENT AND PEACE
WHILE I AM TALKING TO HER YOU MUST BE ENGAGED IN ANOTHER WAY
WELL AT LEAST FOR A WEEK SHE WAS SAFE
WITH BRUSH IN HAND SHE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT LESLIE
HAVE YOU REALLY CONFESSED SAID LESLIE
SHE HAS HAD A LONG QUIET SLEEP AND THE NURSE SAYS SHE IS CERTAINLY BETTER
YES ANNIE COLCHESTER HAD MADE UP HER MIND
THE AIR IS STIFLING BUT THEY ARE JUST SHUTTING UP I SHALL GO--I KNOW A WAY
RUPERT
RUPERT
I DON'T INTEND HER TO DO ALL THE TOILING AND MONEY-MAKING ANY LONGER
ALL WE WANT TO DO IS THIS
THE THREE GIRLS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE IN THE CARRIAGE
TO SIN GRAVELY TO COMMIT A REALLY GREAT SIN WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO A NATURE LIKE LESLIE'S
BUT AFTER ALL HER POVERTY WAS SCARCELY HER WORST TROUBLE NOW
AND THE SHADOW FELL FROM HIS OWN
SO DON'T THINK IT
MY LINES BEGIN WITH DELVE DELVE DEEPLY DELVE I DON'T THINK I QUITE FOLLOW SAID LESLIE
SHE HOPPED UP FROM HER SEAT AND DREW A CHAIR CLOSE TO LESLIE
CHEER UP ABOUT INDIA OLD GIRL
I SHALL BE MOST CURIOUS TO KNOW
IT IS NOTHING BUT A DEVICE OF THE EVIL ONE FOR WASTING TIME
YOU KNOW YOUNG FORREST HAS BEEN MY FRIEND AT SCHOOL AND THERE IS A VACANCY IN THE SHOP
HAVE YOU ANY FRIENDS IN TOWN I HAVE NO SPECIAL FRIENDS
MARJORIE SEATED HERSELF ON A CHAIR NEAR HER MOTHER
NOW THEN WE ARE READY SAID HESTER
BUT WITH THAT GARDEN AT THE BACK IT IS NOT TOO SAFE
DO YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THIS HE CAME TO WINGFIELD TO-DAY
PLENTY OF COLOR BRIGHTENED EACH PAIR OF HEALTHY CHEEKS--THEIR LIPS WERE BEAUTIFULLY FORMED AND THEY HAD SNOW-WHITE PEARLY TEETH
YOU ARE TO INTRODUCE ME TO THE ACHESONS AS YOUR BROTHER
SHE WAS VERY QUEER WHEN I LEFT HER JUST NOW
I QUITE FORGOT SHE SAID COLORING SLIGHTLY
SHE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO LESLIE
NOT ANOTHER WORD MY DEAR FRIEND
AND I MEAN TO TAKE IT LITTLE GIRL SO YOU CAN GO TO WINGFIELD WITH A HEART AND A HALF AND WIN THE ACADEMIC HONORS OF THE FAMILY
BELLE ACHESON LIVED ALTOGETHER FOR THE JOYS OF INTELLECT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I THINK I OUGHT TO GO IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO WATCH THOSE TWO POOR DEAR GIRLS THROUGH THIS ECCENTRIC PHASE OF THEIR EXISTENCE
COME ALONG MOTHER
I ASSURE YOU THE THING IS MOST CORRECT AND PROPER WELL I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT THOUGH I DON'T QUITE BELIEVE IT ALL THE SAME
I DON'T WISH TO TAKE ANYTHING FROM MR PARKER MOTHER
HAS YOUR VISITOR GONE ASKED ANNIE NOT NOTICING THE TONE
BESIDES THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS HERE
SHE BEGS HOWEVER THAT THE STUDENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION WILL ATTEND TO IT
BUT STEAL THAT BOX YOU DON'T
MY SAVINGS SHE CRIED
SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF SOMEONE RUNNING SWIFTLY
NO ONE COULD HAVE WORKED HARDER THAN OUR FATHER DID NO ONE TRULY ECHOED LESLIE
I MUST FRANKLY CONFESS THAT I HAVE NO HOPE AT ALL OF BEING ABLE TO HELP YOU WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY SAID RUPERT WHISTLING GAILY
I HOPE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE MISS GILROY SAID MARJORIE
AS IT IS HOWEVER AS IT IS WE MUST MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS SAID LETITIA
BUT DID SHE TELL YOU ANYTHING--ANYTHING ABOUT EILEEN I ASKED HER IF EILEEN WERE IN DANGER SAID LESLIE AND SHE SAID WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN FOR HER
DON'T SHOW YOU YOUR OWN LETTER
BUT I DID NOT TELL HER THAT I WAS COMING DOWN THE NEXT DAY TO INQUIRE INTO THIS MATTER MYSELF THERE WAS A SEAT CLOSE BY
ANNIE MY DEAR YOU WILL BE AS CLEVER AS CHEEKY AS BOLD AGAIN FOR YOUR POOR BROTHER'S SAKE RUPERT I CANNOT THEN YOU KNOW OF COURSE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE WILL BE RUPERT COLCHESTER NOW COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS MANNER
THEN OF COURSE EVERYTHING IS PLAIN SHE CRIED
SHE COULD CLEAR HERSELF BUT AT WHAT A COST
BUT I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME HAVE THE ROOM TO MYSELF FOR A LITTLE I SHALL GO BY AND BY SAID LESLIE COLDLY
BUT THERE IS THE GIRL GUILTY
MY DEAR MARJORIE HOW YOU HAVE GROWN
ANNIE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED IN HER WILD PACINGS
DON'T YOU WANT ME TO KNOW
IF YOU CANNOT TELL ME WELL THERE'S NO MORE TO BE SAID HE REMARKED
I WON'T BE A MINUTE SEWING UP THAT AWFUL RENT
IF WE ARE BOUND TO ENTERTAIN A GREAT DEAL AT ST WODE'S WE MAY JUST AS WELL STAY WITH MOTHER IN LONDON
SHE IS QUITE THE DEAREST BRAVEST LITTLE MOTHER IN THE WIDE WORLD WELL DRY YOUR TEARS OLD GIRL
I WONDER IF BELLE ARRIVED YESTERDAY OR TO-DAY I SINCERELY TRUST SHE WON'T COME TILL TO-MORROW SAID LETITIA WITH A SHUDDER
THEY WERE VERY LIKE ONE ANOTHER
BUT I NEVER KNEW BEFORE THAT YOU HAD A VOICE I HAVE ONLY A LITTLE VOICE
WILL YOU TELL ME HOW LONG FOUR SHILLINGS--THAT MEANS FORTY-EIGHT PENCE--WILL KEEP ANY GIRL IN FOOD AND RAIMENT I SHOULD BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU
WE WANT YOU TO TALK TO US AND GIVE US YOUR ADVICE
BUT YOU YOURSELF CHOKED US OFF
RUPERT WAS IN DESPERATE STRAITS
I DID WHAT I COULD FOR YOU
WE SHALL BE HAVING TWO PATIENTS INSTEAD OF ONE IF THIS SORT OF THING GOES ON
ARE YOU COMING TO ST WODE'S TO BE A USEFUL MEMBER OF SOCIETY OR A LEARNED OR AN ORNAMENTAL ONE I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID LESLIE
SHE LAID HER HAND NOW UPON THE LAD'S SHOULDER
MARJORIE AND I DO NOT INTEND TO WEAR GAY CLOTHES BECAUSE WE CONSIDER FINERY A SHEER WASTE OF MONEY
SHE IS NOT WORKING QUITE SO HARD
I CAN'T STAND PARKER DOING ALL THE HELP LESLIE
THIS IS A PLACE FOR THE ACQUIRING OF ACADEMIC LEARNING NOT FOR IT IS THE PLACE WHERE BELLE ACHESON IS ACQUIRING HER PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE SAID MARJORIE IN A SLOW VOICE
BUT I WAS DESPERATE
HER ATTITUDE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO STOOD AT ATTENTION
CHAPTER V--THE MODERN VIEW OF LIFE
OH I AM GLAD IT WAS A DREAM AND THAT YOU ARE HERE
NOW SHE HAD TO THINK HOW SHE WAS TO MANAGE
THEY HAVE SAVED A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY IF THAT IS ANY SATISFACTION NONE WHATEVER CHILD
AT SEVEN THE ACHESONS DINED
MRS ACHESON ALTHOUGH A MOST KIND-HEARTED WOMAN AND AFFECTIONATE MOTHER WOULD IF SHE HAD SPOKEN HER INNERMOST THOUGHTS HAVE CONFESSED THAT BELLE WAS NOT AT ALL TO HER MIND
WHO WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT BURGLARS WOULD COME TO US
I NEVER FELT IN SUCH A TERRIBLE STATE IN MY LIFE AND I KNOW THE DOCTORS ARE MOST ANXIOUS
HE SUPPRESSED A SIGH AND ATTACKED THE LOAF WITH VIGOR
SHE DOES FORGET THINGS SO DREADFULLY YES AND I HAVE GOT TO WASH THE TEA-THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO PRY INTO ANY SECRETS
ANNIE STARTED AND FLUSHED GUILTILY
I KNEW HER WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE TOT ALL THE SAME YOU LOOKED LIKE A FOOL WHEN SHE QUESTIONED YOU REPLIED HOPKINS
LESLIE SAW RUPERT AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND NEVER RETURN SHE WOULD KEEP HIS SECRET AND MINE
SHE CEASED TO MOAN HER EYES CLOSED THE FROWN VANISHED FROM HER BROWS AND SHE FELL INTO A HEAVY SLEEP
SHE KNEW THAT IF IT WERE DISCOVERED I SHOULD BE EXPELLED FROM ST WODE'S AND MY CHANCE IN LIFE WOULD BE OVER SO SHE AGREED TO SCREEN ME
NOW LISTEN LESLIE
BUT STILL IT SEEMS A PITY WHAT ASKED ANNIE
THE WAY IS CLEAR
AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO SHE TUMBLED DOWN FROM HER SEAT ON THE WINDOW-SILL AND BEGAN IN A PERFUNCTORY MANNER TO GET READY FOR DINNER
LITTLE CURLS AND BITS OF FLUFFY DOWNY BRIGHTNESS WOULD GET OUT OF THEIR CONFINEMENT AND DANCE ROUND HER SMALL SOFT FACE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO THIS AFTERNOON MISS GILROY I HAVE NOT MADE ANY SPECIAL PLANS WELL THEN WON'T YOU COME OUT ON THE WATER WITH US
THEN HERE WE ARE
CHAPTER XXVI--ANNIE'S REQUEST
I MUST GO AND INQUIRE AFTER EILEEN IMMEDIATELY I THOUGHT YOU WERE NOT WELL YOURSELF I HAVE A HEADACHE BUT WHAT DOES THAT MATTER
I AM MISERABLE AND I KNOW THAT I DESERVE IMPRISONMENT OR ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO GIVE ME SHE SAID
LETITIA IS NOT MY DAUGHTER
I AM DISAPPOINTED
WE DO NOT INTEND TO WASTE MONEY UPON RAIMENT
YOU ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO BE JENNY COME BACK AGAIN
I DON'T MEAN TO WORRY YOU SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
I HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY
LESLIE ROSE
I KNOW IT IS FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE AND MY FATHER'S SAKE THAT'S ABOUT IT AND NEVER NEVER MORE FOR MY SAKE MY FEELINGS HAVE CHANGED TOWARD YOU
THEY ARE JUST MODERN YOU SEE--TERRIBLY MODERN THE REVERSE OF ARCHAIC
HIS VOICE WAS HUSKY NOT TO SAY ROUGH
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO ASK HIM
THE ATTIC WAS NOT FURNISHED WHEN I GOT IT AND I BEGGED AND IMPLORED OF HER TO ALLOW ME TO FURNISH IT IN MY OWN WAY
I SHALL STAY AT HOME TO-NIGHT BUT WHY
I WAS GIVING THE GIRLS A LECTURE UPSTAIRS
CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
IT IS MEN WHO ARE NOWHERE
ANNIE SAT UP AND STIRRED THE CREAM INTO THE FRAGRANT CUP
HE IS A SCOUNDREL AND THE LEAST SAID ABOUT HIM THE BETTER
ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR I
AND THAT IS YOUR OMNIBUS WITH MAIDA VALE MARKED ON IT LESLIE HELD UP HER PARASOL AND THE DRIVER STOPPED
BUT DEAR OLD MAMMY YOU SHAN'T BE WORRIED ANY LONGER
IT HAS BEEN THE DREAM OF HIS LIFE YES IT HAS BEEN THE DREAM OF HIS LIFE REPLIED THE MOTHER
LESLIE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO MR PARKER AND TOOK HIS HAND
I SHALL BE UP FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND IF YOU WISH TO TAKE REFUGE IN MY ROOM YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME LESLIE THANKED HER AND RAN DOWN THE CORRIDOR
BUT SINCE YOU HAVE COME BACK YOU HAVE HARDLY SAID A WORD ABOUT ANY OF YOUR FELLOW-STUDENTS I AM SORRY SAID LESLIE
THE THREE LEFT THE CHURCH AS SILENTLY AS THEY HAD ENTERED
SHE BROUGHT IN A CARD ON A SALVER
I INTEND TO MAKE THE VERY BEST OF EVERYTHING
OUR BEST TUTORS AT ST WODE'S NEVER COUNTENANCE TEA
OH PLEASE DON'T BOTHER ABOUT ME SAID EILEEN
THIS IS MY ROOMFELLOW MISS LESLIE GILROY MISS FRERE HOW DO YOU DO MISS GILROY SAID MISS FRERE IN A PLEASANT VOICE
BUT THE PLACE WAS SO POPULAR THE SYSTEM ON WHICH EVERYTHING WAS WORKED WAS SO ADMIRABLE THAT GIRLS WHO WISHED TO GO TO ST WODE'S HAD AS A RULE TO PUT DOWN THEIR NAMES A COUPLE OF YEARS IN ADVANCE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER GENTLE LIFE HATRED OF ANOTHER WAS VISITING HER
I'LL HAVE IT DARNED IN A TRICE
THE NOISE IN THE ROOM ABOVE WAS MORE AUDIBLE THAN EVER
COME HERE LEW CALLED OUT HIS SISTER
YOU CAN EASILY MANAGE AND IN ANY CASE EVEN IF YOU FAIL I DO NOT MEAN TO FAIL ANY MORE THAN YOU DO REPLIED LESLIE
WE ARE SO TERRIBLY EARNEST NOW WE HAVE NO TIME TO THINK OF MERE ORNAMENTATION THANK GOODNESS LETTIE YOU AT LEAST WILL ALWAYS DRESS NEATLY I SHOULD THINK SO REPLIED LETTIE
BUT I JUST VOW THAT MARJORIE AND EILEEN SHALL SUBMIT TO ME IN MY OWN HOUSE
LESLIE CAME IN AND SOFTLY SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW DREADFUL I FEEL
SINCE YOU CAME I FEEL MYSELF TIED AND BOUND
I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT ANNIE
POOR DARLING LEW
I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE SAID
PROJECT GUTENBERG ALSO HAS AN HTML VERSION OF THIS FILE WHICH INCLUDES THE ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATION
NOW DO LET ME YES DO BELLE
HER FACE IS SO SUNKEN AND OH SO WHITE AND HER EYES SO VERY BIG
I KNEW YOU WOULD SUBMIT.--SHE IS THE BEST LITTLE MOTHER IN THE WHOLE WORLD SAID EILEEN RAPTUROUSLY KISSING HER PARENT AND THEN CLASPING MARJORIE'S HAND
THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ARE
BUT PRESERVE ME FROM SUCH UNCOMMON PEOPLE
BUT ANY GIRL OUGHT TO BE POPULAR AND GOOD WHO WAS BROUGHT UP BY A MOTHER LIKE MINE SAID LESLIE WITH ENTHUSIASM
OH YOU DARLING
OH YOU DARLING
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD DESERT ME
LETTIE WAS ALREADY ATTACKING HER WITH NEEDLE AND THREAD
THIS TABLE IS NEVER TO BE TOUCHED
THERE IS A STOOL A HIGH STOOL ON WHICH I SIT
COME SHE SAID
I OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF
OH I HAVE NOT A WORD TO SAY AGAINST HOME GIRLS BUT CERTAINLY COLLEGE LIFE DOES STRENGTHEN ONE
MOST I MUST TELL YOU FRANKLY REQUIRE THE MEREST GLANCE TO TELL ME WHAT FAILURES THEY ARE CERTAIN TO BE
I SHALL BE SEVENTEEN MY NEXT BIRTHDAY
HE WAS BENDING FORWARD AND TALKING IN AN EAGER VOICE
BUT THEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS GOOD WOMAN PITIED HER BECAUSE SHE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM A GIRLISH DEPRESSION OR SOME OTHER EQUALLY UNIMPORTANT CONTRETEMPS CAUSED HER HEART TO RISE WITH WILD REBELLION IN HER BREAST
PERHAPS I COULD COUNSEL YOU IF YOU ARE IN ANY DIFFICULTY NO NO
IT DRIVES ME HALF-WILD SOMETIMES MY DEAR BOY I ENJOY IT SAID THE MOTHER
NOTHING IS ADMIRED SO MUCH AS THE UNCOMMON
HOW EXTRAORDINARY OF MISS FOX NOT TO LET ME KNOW SAID MRS CHETWYND
LESLIE IS TO HAVE A CHANCE A RIGHT GOOD CHANCE IN LIFE MOTHER WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID LESLIE
OR YES PERHAPS I SHOULD
TASTE WHAT IS TASTE
I WONDER WHAT SHE CAN WANT WITH US ALL WELL THERE IS NO GOOD IN GUESSING SAID EILEEN
SHE HAD BEEN WELL TRAINED SHE HAD PLENTY OF SELF-POSSESSION AND AN ABUNDANCE OF STRONG COMMON-SENSE
I COULD NOT KEEP THAT SORT ABOUT ME YOU UNDERSTAND PLEASE GO ON SAID LESLIE
HE HAS A GREAT AND SINCERE RESPECT FOR ALL LEARNING
THEN WHY DO YOU DO IT SAID MR PARKER
THERE IS A SMALL HARD MATTRESS ON IT
BUT THE TEARS WHICH HAD BEEN COMING TO HER EYES NOW ROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS
BUT GOD HELP ME I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO BEAR ALL THIS AWFUL BURDEN THE POOR GIRL LOOKED SO MISERABLE AT BREAKFAST THAT MRS ACHESON REMARKED IT
BUT SHE'S THE BEST-NATURED YOUNG LADY THAT EVER WALKED
YOU GO TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE
YOU ARE LIKE THE REST MISS LESLIE
BUT I WANT TO SAVE THE MOTHER TO KEEP HER FROM TOILING WHEN SHE IS OLD TO HELP THE YOUNGER CHILDREN
AND SEEING THAT THE GIRL LOOKED FORLORN AND TIRED WITH A DROOP ABOUT HER LIPS AND AN EXPRESSION IN HER EYES WHICH QUITE WENT TO THE GOOD WOMAN'S HEART SHE KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY BADE HER WELCOME AND TOOK HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
DID YOU SPEAK MRS CHETWYND I DID NOT REPLIED MRS CHETWYND IN AN ANGRY VOICE
YOU HAVE HEARD OF THAT AWFUL PLACE KLONDIKE WHERE PEOPLE GO MAD OVER EARTHLY GOLD
IT IS NOT THAT I MEAN
THERE ARE MANY HOTELS IN LONDON
SHE BOUGHT BIG JARS OF DARK-BLUE CHINA A FEW CUPS AND SAUCERS TWO OR THREE PLATES A FAN OR TWO A COUPLE OF SCREENS A FEW AESTHETIC-LOOKING TABLECLOTHS AND A PIANO-CLOTH TO COVER THE BACK OF HER CHEST OF DRAWERS
THE SUBJECTS ARE LATIN GREEK MATHEMATICS
WE WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT NURSING SOMETHING TOO ABOUT MEDICINE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
I PREFER THE ONE WITH MY BACK TO IT
H'M
I HAVE TOLD GOD EXACTLY WHAT I WANT
YOU ARE TO GO STRAIGHT UP TO HER THIS MINUTE MARJORIE WISHES TO SEE MISS GILROY INTERRUPTED MRS CHETWYND
OTHERS AGAIN ARE MORE ECONOMICAL
SO GENEROUS AT HEART
I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM MORE THERE WAS A NOTE OF SUCH UTTER MISERY IN ANNIE'S VOICE THAT LESLIE WRETCHED AS SHE WAS STARTED UP AND SHOOK HERSELF
LET US TALK OVER OUR MUTUAL STUDIES
I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM MARJORIE POOR CHILD I TRUST SHE IS BECOMING MORE REASONABLE
LESLIE SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM
WHATEVER HAPPENED IT WOULD NEVER DO TO TELL ABOUT ANNIE
JUST HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DINNER ANNIE WALKED IN
FRANK NORRIS HAS WRITTEN IN BLIX JUST WHAT SUCH A WOMAN'S NAME WOULD IMPLY--A STORY OF A FRANK FEARLESS GIRL COMRADE TO ALL MEN WHO ARE TRUE AND HONEST BECAUSE SHE IS TRUE AND HONEST
WHEN LESLIE TELLS ME THE EXACT TRUTH YOU ANNIE COLCHESTER SHALL HAVE THE PLACE
YOU CANNOT MEAN TO GO ON WITH THIS
ARE THESE THE THINGS WE LIVE AT ST WODE'S FOR
I CANNOT THINK WHERE I PUT IT
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY SEE IT TO-NIGHT INSTEAD OF THE PURE PALE LINEAMENT OF SPENSER'S FAERIE QUEENE--INSTEAD OF DANTE'S BEATRICE--INSTEAD OF THE DIVINE ALTHEA IN RICHARD LOVELACE'S MATCHLESS VERSES
I AM NOT A MAGICIAN
WHAT DOES IT MATTER CRIED BELLE
SHE RAN DOWN THE CORRIDOR TO HER OWN ROOM
I--I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS SHE GOT OFF THE BED AS SHE SPOKE
YES I MUST HAVE ONE OF THOSE PRETTY ART TABLE-CLOTHS AND THEN I WANT TO GO TO A GROCER'S WHERE I CAN BUY COCOA AND BISCUITS AND TINNED MILK AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF TIME SPENT IN MAKING THEIR VARIOUS PURCHASES THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THE COLLEGE WELL LADEN
BUT YOUR MOTHER SUGGESTS THAT I SHOULD MAKE AN EDUCATED WOMAN OF YOU TO A CERTAIN EXTENT LESLIE IS THAT ALREADY INTERRUPTED THE MOTHER
THE SCREEN IS TO PUT ROUND YOUR WASHHAND-STAND
SHE GLANCED AT PARKER WHOSE DEEP-SET EYES TWINKLED HALF WITH FUN AND HALF WITH SYMPATHY
BUT WE ARE NOT SUCH DREADFUL GIRLS AFTER ALL
NORTH HALL WAS THE HOUSE OF RESIDENCE WHERE BELLE ACHESON CARRIED ON HER VAGARIES AND PLEASED HERSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE CLEVEREST AND MOST DISTINGUISHED GIRLS IN COLLEGE
SHE IS WITH HER FRIENDS THE CHETWYNDS
SHOULD SHE TELL ANNIE THAT SHE HAD LISTENED TO HER THAT SHE HAD OVERHEARD HER CONVERSATION THAT SHE KNEW A PART AT LEAST OF THE TERRIBLE SECRET WHICH WAS WEIGHING HER DOWN
THE MASTERLY AND REALISTIC NOVELS OF FRANK NORRIS HANDSOMELY BOUND IN CLOTH
A BRIGHT LITTLE FIRE BURNED IN THE GRATE WHICH WAS AGREEABLE AS THE EVENING WAS SOMEWHAT CHILLY
CLEVER WITH A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AND BLIND WORSHIP FOR THAT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING BROTHER OF HERS
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT SHE MAY HAVE GONE DOWN THE BACK-STAIRS AND BE ALREADY IN THE HALL SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLIE
LET ME LOOK AT YOU STEADILY LESLIE SEATED HERSELF ON THE VERY STIFF AND UNCOMFORTABLE CHAIR POINTED OUT BY HER COMPANION AND BELLE EYED HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT
SHE WAS SO WEARY THAT SHE COULD NOT EVEN THINK ANY LONGER
I HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO WORRY ME JUST NOW CONTINUED BELLE
OH A UNIVERSITY MAN IS NOT THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD LESLIE
I SAID YOU WERE ILL AND HUMBUG INTERRUPTED ANNIE
AREN'T YOU COMING TO EAST HALL IN RESPONSE TO MISS LAUDERDALE'S ORDERS
THE HOUSE IS VERY FULL AND THE VICE-PRINCIPAL OF NORTH HALL MISS PENROSE WAS QUITE WILLING TO OBLIGE ME
THAT LETTER WHICH SEEMED TO BE LESLIE'S SHOOK MY FAITH
I CANNOT GRANT YOUR REQUEST WHATEVER IT IS EXCEPT IN MY OWN FASHION
BUT LISTEN
DEAR ME LETTIE DO COME IN SAID EILEEN
NOW WHAT ARE YOU WINKING AT ME FOR LETITIA I WAS NOT WINKING AT YOU SAID LETITIA
BUT IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT FOR YOU LESLIE
HE HAD SCARCELY DONE SO BEFORE MRS ACHESON'S VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOCKED DOOR
GO UP TO HER LESLIE
SHE ALSO DID A GOOD DEAL OF OTHER JOURNALISTIC WORK AND OCCASIONALLY WROTE UP-TO-DATE ARTICLES IN THE MAGAZINES
SHE DID NOT SPEAK FOR SOME TIME
MOTHER IS CERTAIN NOT TO MEET US AT KING'S CROSS AND OLD FOWLER WILL NOT SEE WHAT CLASS WE ALIGHT FROM I AM GLAD AUNT HELEN HAS SECURED FOWLER AS HER COACHMAN SAID LETITIA
COME UPSTAIRS MY DARLINGS SHE SAID
THAT A DRESS HOWEVER SIMPLE OUGHT TO BE WHOLE AND DECENT-LOOKING AND CLEAN OH OF COURSE I ADMIT THAT
THANK YOU FOR COMING
FINALLY SHE WAS GIVEN MOST OF THE GIRLS OUTFITS TO UNDERTAKE
ON HER HEAD WAS A BROWN HAT MUSHROOM-SHAPED TRIMMED WITH A PLAIN BAND OF RIBBON OF THE SAME COLOR
THEY ASKED HER EAGERLY ABOUT HER FORMER LIFE AND WHAT SHE HAD DONE IN THE WAY OF STUDY
IT STOPPED AT NEARLY EVERY STATION
I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT YOU SCARCELY TOUCHED YOUR DINNER WHEN DID I EAT
DO YOU SEE THE SQUARE CUT OUT OF THAT PANE OF GLASS
QUITE WITHIN THE APPOINTED TIME THE THREE GIRLS RETURNED
SCARCELY REALIZING WHAT SHE WAS DOING LESLIE NOW WALKED DOWN A SIDE-PATH WHICH LED TO THE RIVER
BUT WHEN HE SAW ANNIE COMING TO MEET HIM ALONE A HEAVY FROWN COMPLETELY ALTERED HIS EXPRESSION HIS LIPS TOOK A SARCASTIC AND EVEN MALIGNANT CURVE
SHE IS MY NIECE
YOU HAVE LIVED WITH US SINCE YOU WERE A BABY
YOU MAY BUY ANY ORNAMENTS IN THE WAY OF PICTURES OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU FANCY
BUT STILL WHAT SHE DID FOR HER OWN GIRLS SHE INVARIABLY DID FOR HER HUSBAND'S NIECE
KITTY AND I MUST GO UPSTAIRS TO TURN DOWN THE BEDS AND THEN I MUST SEE ELFREDA IN ORDER TO GET HER TO PUT THE FISH IN SOAK FOR TO-MORROW'S BREAKFAST
MY DEAR EMILY DO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BELLE CONTINUED MRS CHETWYND
AH MY DEAR SAID MISS FRERE TURNING TO LESLIE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH ME BUT PLEASE MISS FRERE INTERRUPTED JANE MISS GILROY HAS JUST TOLD ME THAT SHE IS GOING TO STUDY LITERATURE IN THAT CASE I AM NOT THE TUTOR WHO WILL HAVE TO LOOK AFTER YOU REPLIED MISS FRERE
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT
FOR THE FIRST TERM SHE MUST SHARE A LARGE ROOM WITH ANOTHER GIRL
IT WAS HOT OUTSIDE BUT HERE IT WAS STILL AND COOL
THIS WILL UPSET ME HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
EILEEN AND I HAVE LEFT SCHOOL
WHAT YOU WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS A LONG QUIET SLEEP AND YOU MUST HAVE IT
WITH THEIR REALLY HANDSOME FACES THEIR WIDE-OPEN INTELLIGENT EYES THEIR EXQUISITELY-FORMED LIPS AND PEARLY ROWS OF TEETH THEY WERE NOTHING BUT AWKWARD GAUCHE AND UNPRESENTABLE
THE POLICE ARE AFTER HIM I KNOW
I WILL BRING YOU DOWN TO THE HALL PRESENTLY AND INTRODUCE YOU TO SEVERAL OF THE GIRLS
ANYTHING COULD BE DONE WITH THEM IF ONLY THEY WOULD SUBMIT TO THE ORDINARY REGULATIONS OF POLITE SOCIETY
I SPENT SEVERAL OF MY EARLY YEARS IN AMERICA AND I REMEMBER WHEN THERE MEETING A MAN WITH A FOREHEAD LIKE YOURS
GO ON BELLE GO ON SHE SAID
SHE SEEMS THE SORT OF GIRL ONE WOULD RELY ON A GOOD BIT
BURNE-JONES LOVE AMONG THE RUINS THE HAPPY WARRIOR BY WATTS ST CECILIA AND A CHOIR OF ANGELS BY VAN EYCK AND OTHER TREASURES WERE SECURED
SHE SIGNED THE LETTER WITH MY SIGNATURE AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT CAME FROM ME
SHE ONLY DID THE ROUGH WORK UNDER SEVERE SUPERINTENDENCE FROM KITTY
HE PATTED LLEWELLYN AGAIN ON THE SHOULDER
OH YES I KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER SUFFERED AND WHAT WE ALL FELT
OH I KNOW SHE ADDED HER FACE TURNING PALE THAT YOU ARE HIDING SOMETHING DREADFUL FROM ME
YOU ARE NOT LAUGHING AT ME INDEED I AM NOT SAID LESLIE
I WANT A FRIEND TO KEEP ME COMPANY AN INTELLIGENT FRIEND
DON'T YOU HEAR TWO FOOTSTEPS
AND IT ALL ENDS IN THE OLD-FASHIONED HEALTHY AMERICAN WAY
MABEL LAID THE WHITE CLOTH WHICH WAS MADE OF THE FINEST DAMASK ON THE CENTER TABLE
THE GIRLS COULD TALK WELL
BUT NOW WE WILL SAVE HER WON'T WE
COME ON IN FRONT PLEASE
I WANT ANNIE COLCHESTER TO HELP ME WITH THIS TRANSLATION
HOW DO YOU DO SAID JANE NODDING TO THE TWO CHETWYND GIRLS
WELL NOW LET US COUNT
I SENT YOU TO THE BEST SCHOOLS I COULD AFFORD AND HAVE ALWAYS ATTENDED TO YOUR WARDROBE AND GIVEN YOU PLENTY OF POCKET-MONEY
HE SIGHED AND FELT HIMSELF COLORING
LISTEN SHE ADDED
MY MIND IS WRAPPED IN MEDITATION AND THOUGHTS OF THE FUTURE
AND WHEN I PASSED MY EXAM
LETTIE WAS EXTREMELY POPULAR IN HER OWN HALL OF RESIDENCE AND HAD MADE SEVERAL FRIENDS ALREADY IN NORTH HALL
MUCH REPLIED BELLE
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MR COLCHESTER WHAT IT HAS COST ME
YOU ARE JUST THE SORT TO FLING ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND DEVOTE YOURSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE ACQUIRING OF GLORIOUS KNOWLEDGE I HAVE FELT LIKE THAT NOW AND THEN SAID ANNIE
LONG YEARS AFTERWARD ANNIE COLCHESTER REMEMBERED THAT DRIVE
LET US GO OUT SOMEWHERE SAID MR PARKER
JIM GOES TO OXFORD IN THE AUTUMN
I FOR INSTANCE SHOULD NOT AT ALL OBJECT TO MATERIALS FOR A NEW GOWN
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND THE ROOM BEING IN DISORDER
YES MA'AM SHE'S MY CHARGE
THE MAN WHO WAS WITH YOU DON'T DARE TO SAY A WORD AGAINST HIM CRIED ANNIE
IT HAS NEARLY DRIVEN ME MAD
NOW BELLE ALTHOUGH SHE DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WORLD SHE DESPISED LIKE A MAN IN HIS FIRST ADOLESCENCE WAS DISTURBED BY THESE GLANCES FROM RUPERT'S DARK EYES
SHE WAS HOLDING A LONG YELLOW CANARY ON HER FINGER AND WHISTLING TO THE BIRD WHO PECKED AT HER IN HAPPY CONFIDENCE
SHE SOUNDED THE ELECTRIC BELL BY THE FIREPLACE AND PRESENTLY THE FOOTMAN APPEARED
SHE QUESTIONED ANNIE STILL FURTHER WITH REGARD TO THE BURGLARY
EILEEN ALSO KISSED HER
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WISHED TO SLEEP
MY IDEA IS TO HAVE ONE WARM DRESS FOR THE WINTER AND ONE COOL ONE FOR THE SUMMER AND NO MORE
THEN SHE TURNED TO RUPERT
IT MAKES EVERYTHING WORTH WHILE SOMEHOW
I THOUGHT SHE WAS LIKE MY JENNY
I MISSED THE TEA WHICH YOU YOU KIND LITTLE ROOMFELLOW HAVE GENERALLY GOT FOR ME GO ON
AND YOU SHALL TAKE MY PLACE ALL IN GOOD TIME
YOU ARE A HOME-GIRL
IS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM SHE CRIED
THE GIRLS HAD JUST OPENED THE DOOR WHEN THEY SAW BELLE ACHESON COMING UP THE STEPS
LETTIE'S WERE EXTENSIVE
LETTIE LAUGHED ALOUD
HE DID NOT HAPPEN TO TELL YOU WHICH ONE HE WAS STAYING AT MY LOVE NO SAID ANNIE HE DID NOT THAT IS A PITY BUT CONTINUED THE YOUNG GIRL I CAN GIVE HIM YOUR INVITATION
BELLE CAME IN WITH A QUEER EAGER LOOK ON HER FACE A KIND OF HUNGRY HALF-STARVED LOOK
THE CURTAIN DROPS FOREVER ON RUPERT AS FAR AS THIS STORY IS CONCERNED
MOST FORTUNATELY I TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO PROVIDE MYSELF WITH ANOTHER PAIR OR I SHOULD BE LOST SIMPLY LOST
I MEAN TO HAVE A VERY FULL AND VERY BUSY LIFE MOTHER DITTO CRIED MARJORIE
AFTER A TIME SHE GOT UP PUT HER BOOK BACK IN ITS PLACE AND WALKED TO THE DOOR
AS TO THE YOUNG PERSON IN THE STERN I REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER EXISTENCE
I COULD NOT GUESS THAT YOU WOULD MAKE USE OF ME
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME HE CRIED
CHAPTER VIII THE GILROYS
HER CHEEKS WERE GHASTLY WHITE
WE SHALL HAVE NO TIME FOR AMUSEMENT JANE MUTTERED SOMETHING UNDER HER BREATH
I WAS ALWAYS VERY CLEVER AT IMITATING HANDWRITING AND THERE WAS PLENTY OF LESLIE'S ABOUT
SHE LIKES TO DUST THE DRAWING ROOM HERSELF AND A FEW DAYS AGO SHE LIFTED THE BOX AND SAID
ANNIE AND I ARE PRACTICALLY ALONE IN THE WORLD
HER DRESS WAS VERY UNTIDY AND THERE WAS A GREAT RENT BEHIND
WHEN SHE HAD GONE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS SHE TURNED BACK AND CALLED OUT TO THE OTHER GIRLS WHO WERE STILL STANDING ON THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE
ANNIE COLCHESTER'S ONLY CHANCE IS TO APOLOGIZE TO MISS LAUDERDALE I WILL TELL HER
NOTHING OF THE KIND
IT IS TOO WONDERFUL
IF A REALLY ESTIMABLE WORTHY MAN TAKES A FANCY TO ANY OF MY GIRLS AND HIS AFFECTION IS RETURNED I SHALL LOOK UPON MARRIAGE AS A SUITABLE LIFE FOR MY CHILDREN
IN HIS WAY HE IS AN ENTHUSIAST
I PITY YOU FROM MY SOUL
THEY WERE ALL SHE WAS GLAD TO KNOW ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE
I SEE YOU CANNOT PUT THE THING STRAIGHT AS I HAD HOPED JUST FOR A MOMENT
I AM THE MOST WRETCHED MISERABLE GIRL IN THE WORLD
YOU SHALL BE ANNE OR ANN WHILE YOU ARE HERE
LESLIE IN HER OWN ROOM ALSO SLEPT AND BRIGHT DREAMS CAME TO HER
YOU OUGHT TO GO TO BED SHE SAID
WELL I DISMISSED HIM A MONTH AGO FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT
OH THERE THE CLOCK HAS STRUCK TEN AND HE WILL BE WAITING FOR ME
YOU ARE ONE OF THE GIRLS I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE WITH ME THERE
DID YOU SAY SHE CONTINUED THAT ANNIE TOOK YOU THAT NOTE HERSELF YES MY DEAR
I AM WORKING HARD FOR MATHEMATICAL HONORS AND I HAVE ONLY THIS TERM IN WHICH TO PREPARE SURELY A LONG TIME SAID LESLIE
KITTY AND MABEL LAID DOWN THEIR NEEDLEWORK
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT OUR CONVERSATION WILL INTEREST YOU
LESLIE STARTED TO HER FEET A VEXED EXCLAMATION CAME TO HER LIPS AND WITH DIFFICULTY REMAINED UNSPOKEN FOR ANNIE COLCHESTER STOOD BEFORE HER
DEAR OLD JANIE HOW ARE YOU SAID ALICE
MISS LAUDERDALE IS OF COURSE THE PRINCIPAL OVER THE ENTIRE COLLEGE
YES DARLING
MISS LAUDERDALE OUR ADORED PRINCIPAL SEES TO THAT
DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT LESLIE HARDLY SLEPT BUT ANNIE NEVER STIRRED
WHAT ARE YOU COMPARED TO RUPERT
THE POLICE WERE ALREADY AFTER HIM
BUT SHE WAS AWAKENED JUST WHEN THE DAWN WAS BREAKING BY A NOISE IN THE ROOM
NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THIS AT THE TIME AND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE EVENING WERE IMMEDIATELY BEGUN
IT WAS GOOD OF YOU TO COME TO SEE ME SAID LESLIE AND OF COURSE I AM EVER SO PLEASED
YOU MUST TAKE THE INITIATIVE NOW SAID ANNIE TOUCHING LESLIE ON THE ARM
MR PARKER FIXED HER WITH HIS KEEN TWINKLING EYES
I HAVE JUST BEEN READING A PASSAGE WHICH I SHOULD BE GLAD TO REPEAT TO YOU MARJORIE WENT ON A LITTLE UNWILLINGLY
PERHAPS I CAN DO SOMETHING FOR YOU I WISHED TO SEE HER
THAT SIXTY POUNDS IS MY PRESENT TO YOU
WE NEVER DO THAT AT NORTH HALL IT IS SO SCHOOLGIRLISH--AT LEAST NOT THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE WORTH ANYTHING
LESLIE ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO STAY HERE SHE CERTAINLY IS SAID MARJORIE
ON THE NEXT FLOOR WERE THE GIRLS ROOMS LUXURIOUSLY AND BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED
AH I SEE YOU DO NOT KNOW HER YET
BUT I CANNOT BID YOUR BROTHER GOOD-BY NOR SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM
AFTER SHE HAS MADE HER CONFESSION SHE SHALL COME WITH ME TO THE GILROYS
WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU
MY MOTHER AGREES ENTIRELY WITH MISS FRERE AND THEREFORE YOU AGREE WITH MISS FRERE
MARJORIE WAS IN BED CURLED UP AS HER FASHION WAS WITH THE BEDCLOTHES TUCKED TIGHTLY ROUND HER
MRS ACHESON RECEIVED HIM WITH HER USUAL KINDNESS
AND ANNIE IS IN LUCK TO HAVE MADE YOU HER FRIEND
SHE SELDOM TROUBLED TO TAKE IT UPSTAIRS
HIS FACE WAS PALE AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS GRAY EYES HEAVY
SHE SHUT THE WINDOW
HIS MOTHER LOOKED UP AT HIM
IN HER SHORT LIFE SHE HAD PRAYED A GOOD DEAL FINDING PRAYER THE GREATEST SUPPORT IN EACH HOUR OF TRIAL
I DON'T WISH RUPERT COLCHESTER BAD AS HE IS TO BE LOCKED UP
THE GREEK DIALECTS CLASSIFIED AS IONIAN AND NON-IONIAN ARE FULL OF THE DEEPEST INTEREST SHE FLED FROM THE ROOM IN A SORT OF WHIRLWIND SLAMMING THE DOOR AFTER HER
IN HER AGITATION AND ANGER HER SPECTACLES DROPPED FROM HER NOSE
COME WE HAVE NO MORE TIME TO WASTE
JUST WALK SLOWLY ON AND I'LL SOON OVERTAKE YOU ANNIE HAD NOT GONE A DOZEN YARDS BEFORE RUPERT CAME UP TO HER
HURRY UP
AND WHENEVER YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR CONFIDENCE I SHALL BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO RECEIVE IT AND ALSO ANNIE MY DEAR TO RESPECT IT
MY VOGUE IN LIFE IS THE USEFUL
THEN IT IS ALL RIGHT SHE SAID
THE FRIVOLOUS FACT THAT I AM OUT ON THE WATER BEING ROWED BY YOU AND EILEEN THAT I AM WASTING SOME OF THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A GOLDEN DAY MUST BE COUNTERACTED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU TRANSLATED THUCYDIDES FOR US
BUT IT IS A GREAT CHANCE AND YOU HAVE REALLY ACCEPTED IT MOTHER I HAVE
YOU WILL WANT SHELVES FOR YOUR BOOKS AND A FEW KNICK-KNACKS AND IF YOU GO WITH THAT YOUNG PERSON SAID BELLE MAKING A STEP FORWARD
I KNOW YOU WILL BE A BRAVE GIRL
IT SHALL BE A BARGAIN BETWEEN US AND I WILL DO THE SAME FOR YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN SHOULD THE POSITION BE REVERSED THOSE WERE HIS WORDS MA'AM SAID MR PARKER STANDING UP AS HE SPOKE AND I NEVER FORGOT THEM--NEVER
WITH A FRONTISPIECE IN COLORS BY HOWARD CHANDLER CHRISTY
THE HOUSE WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING
THE WOMAN WHOM THE GIRL ADDRESSED GLANCING FIRST AT THE SHABBY CLOTHES THEN AT THE KIND BRIGHT HANDSOME YOUNG FACE DECIDED THAT THE GIRL WAS NOT VERY MUCH ABOVE HERSELF IN THE SOCIAL SCALE AND AGREED TO LET HER HOLD HER BABY FOR A BIT
SO I HAVE HEARD
HERE I AM AND RIGHT GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MRS GILROY
HER PALLOR WAS SUDDENLY SUCCEEDED BY A QUICK FLUSH OF COLOR
IN THE MEANTIME MRS CHETWYND HAD GONE THROUGH MORE THAN ONE STORMY SCENE WITH MARJORIE AND EILEEN
HE HAS WHAT I CALL A PURE TASTE FOR THE CLASSICS
IF IT COMES WELL AND GOOD
WHEREVER WE ARE WE MUST LIVE MUST WE SAID ANNIE IN A VERY PATHETIC VOICE
SHE HAS HAD A VERY PLEASANT TOUR IN SWITZERLAND
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THAT LETTER WAS DROPPED INTO THE NEAREST PILLAR-BOX
CAN I GIVE YOU A CUP OF TEA TEA CRIED BELLE
WHAT ARE YOU FIDGETING SO DREADFULLY ABOUT NOTHING MY LOVE
I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF MISS LAUDERDALE YET AND AM MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR HER SPEAK TO-NIGHT
CHAPTER XI--ST
DON'T I BEG OF YOU I WAS THINKING OF IT
I FELT I WOULD RATHER GET THE NEWS GOOD OR BAD FROM YOU
IT IS TERRIBLE TO FEEL THAT I HAVE BROUGHT GIRLS LIKE MARJORIE AND EILEEN INTO THE WORLD
IT IS ALMOST ON FIRE AND MY FEET ARE LIKE ICE
SOUND THE GONG WHEN IT IS READY HE BOUNDED UP THE NARROW STAIRS THREE AT A TIME TO HIS OWN SPECIAL DEN AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
EILEEN AND MARJORIE HAVING SUBMITTED TO THE NECESSARY TEST WERE MADE FULL-BLOWN MEMBERS OF THE LATTER CLUB IMMEDIATELY
IN EVERY RESPECT YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED AS A DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE
LIE DOWN
SHE SEES ME MUTTERING AND YET SHE WILL NOT GO
DO COME ANNIE DO STILL THERE WAS NO RESPONSE
FOR GREAT SINS AS HE HAS COMMITTED I STILL LOVE HIM
THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS A PARADISE AN OASIS
BUT SHE MUST BE A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN I DO NOT SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT
YOU ARE ALWAYS SO WISE
HESTER WAS EVIDENTLY THE TROUBLESOME ONE OF THE FAMILY
I WANT TO HELP ANNIE COLCHESTER
GOOD-NIGHT I AM DEAD TIRED
OH IT HAS A SHOCKING EFFECT
AND AS FOR YOU MISS MARJORIE YOU MUST GO TO BED AND HAVE A REST I AM SORRY TO TELL YOU DR HOWARD SAID DR ERICSON THAT MISS MARJORIE HAS BEEN BEHAVING IN A VERY NATURAL BUT ALSO A VERY REPREHENSIBLE MANNER
NOR DO I LAUGH AT YOU SAID LESLIE
MR PARKER IS SUCH AN OLD FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S THAT I AM WILLING TO PUT MYSELF UNDER THIS SUPREME OBLIGATION
MAKING A VIOLENT EFFORT NOT TO SHOW THE ALARM WHICH WAS PALING HER CHEEKS AND ALMOST CAUSING HER HEART TO STOP BEATING SHE SAID QUICKLY
KITTY THEN KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO MAKE AN APPARENTLY UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF BUTTERED TOAST
THEIR EYES WERE BRIGHT AND THEIR CHEEKS FLUSHED
IT IS ONLY AN INCH LONG AND WITH A COUPLE OF BRUSHES ONE IN EACH HAND I CAN PUSH IT INTO ANY POSITION I LIKE
HE HAS EVEN HINTED THAT BY AND BY HE WILL DO GREAT THINGS FOR KITTY AND FOR MABEL AND WHAT ABOUT POOR HESTER SAID THAT INDIVIDUAL DROPPING HER STOCKING AND LOOKING WITH PITEOUS EYES AT HER MOTHER
I COULD NOT HAVE LEFT MOTHER IF LLEWELLYN WERE NOT WITH HER
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW ALL THOSE PORTERS ARE ENJOYING THE SCENE
BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY THE REGULARITY OF HER FEATURES AND THE CLEARNESS OF HER COMPLEXION WHICH MADE LESLIE'S FACE SO SPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE
THEN SHE SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW AND DID NOT SPEAK ANY MORE
THE SICK GIRL WAS FIGHTING DEATH IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD AND LESLIE FOUND HERSELF ALONE IN THE PRETTY BOUDOIR
CHAPTER XIII--A COCOA PARTY
AND I SHALL GO MAD RAVING MAD
I KNOW BY YOUR FACE YOU ARE IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN I AM I AM REPLIED THE GIRL ADDRESSED AS EILEEN
TO OBLIGE YOU I'LL DO WHAT YOU WISH SHE SAID
BUT THIS EVENING AND TO-MORROW YOU MUST PUT UP WITH US
IF ANNIE LIKES SHE CAN STAY AND HELP ME FOR SHE HAS QUITE A GOOD TASTE IN GREEK AND A NICE ACCENT
HER TANGLED SHORT HAIR WAS WAVED LIKE A MOP OVER HER HEAD
BUT YOU MUST
LESLIE AS SHE WATCHED HER COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IF SHE HAD GOT THE MONEY SHE WANTED SO BADLY
BUT HOW CAN YOU KNOW AS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE WHETHER MINE IS AN EARNEST CHARACTER OR NOT AH YOU LITTLE GUESS MY CAPACITY SAID BELLE IN A PATRONIZING VOICE
LLEWELLYN YOU MUST BE MAD I AM NOT
YOU BARELY QUALIFIED--NO MORE
SHE TOLD US THAT MISS LAUDERDALE HAD GIVEN HER LEAVE
I SHALL TAKE OPPORTUNITIES OF COMING IN WHEN YOU ARE ABSENT
BUT ALL MY SECURITY WAS FALSE AND I AM DONE FOR--RUINED
MOVE DOWN A LITTLE PLEASE JANE SHE CONTINUED TURNING TO ANOTHER GIRL WITH A ROSY FACE AND DARK EYES
NOW WHAT IS IT HE SAID
ANNIE FEARED IT
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR
WELL DO LET THE WINDOW REMAIN SHUT
BELLE HOPES TO OPEN HER HOSTEL WITHIN A YEAR AT THE LATEST
HE HAD SCARCELY TAKEN HIS PLACE AT THE TABLE BEFORE THERE WAS THE CLICK OF A LATCHKEY IN THE HALL DOOR AND LIGHT STEPS THE STEPS OF A YOUNG GIRL WERE HEARD IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE
WITH THAT SIXTY POUNDS OR WITHOUT I LEAVE ENGLAND IN A DAY OR TWO
IN ALL PROBABILITY THE THREE GIRLS WILL MARRY CONTINUED MRS CHETWYND IN HER CALM EVEN VOICE WHICH SELDOM ROSE TO EXCITEMENT OR DROPPED TO MELANCHOLY
YES SAID MRS CHETWYND UTTERING A SIGH AS SHE SPOKE THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR ME
LESLIE WAITED BEHIND UNTIL HER COMPANION WAS WELL OUT OF SIGHT THEN SHE FOLLOWED HER
WHEN COMPLETED THE EFFECT WAS CHARMING
BUT I SHALL NOT PUT MYSELF INTO HIS HANDS
THAT YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN TAKE MONEY FROM HER
BUT HERE WE ARE
THIS SOFA FORMS YOUR BED AT NIGHT
AND YET YOU HAVE A FINE WELL-DEVELOPED BROW SHE SAID
FOR NEARLY AN HOUR LESLIE GILROY SAT ON THAT SEAT ALONE
BUT WHEN YOU SPEAK AGAINST HIM I CANNOT BEAR YOU FEEL JUST AS YOU PLEASE ABOUT ME SAID LESLIE
SHE WAS THEREFORE COMPLETELY WORSTED BY HER CLEVER AND MODERN DAUGHTERS
WHEN DID YOU SEE MOTHER LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO
IN SOME WONDER AND FEELING ALMOST DAZED BY HER RECENT CONVERSATION SHE RETURNED TO HER OWN ROOM IN NORTH HALL
YES IT WAS USELESS WAS IT NOT OF COURSE
THEY FELL WITH A CRASH ON THE FLOOR AND ONE GLASS WAS BROKEN
SHE HELPED HERSELF TO BROWN BREAD AND BUTTER
WELL AT ANY RATE EXPECT ME AT DINNER TIME CHAPTER XXXI HANDWRITING
THEY FLASHED WITH SUDDEN FIRE
BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND SHE PREFERS THE UTTER INANITY OF A DRIVE WHY SURELY YOU CAN GO WITH HER SO I WILL SAID MRS ACHESON
JANE PROCEEDED TO MAKE COCOA CHATTING AS SHE DID SO
THE COLLEGE AND LECTURE-ROOMS THEMSELVES ARE IN A SEPARATE BUILDING
THEY PRETEND TO BE DELIGHTED TO SEE A PERSON WHO IN REALITY THEY LOATHE
I CAN'T STAND IT
BUT RAISING HER EYES SHE MET THOSE OF LLEWELLYN
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE GRACEFUL OF YOU MAMMY
BUT I SHALL NOT HURRY THE MATTER NOR PUT MYSELF OUT ABOUT IT
WHY SHOULD I
GOOD-BY MARJORIE SHE SAID HOLDING OUT HER HAND
I REQUIRE LIGHT FOR MY WORK
LESLIE HAD NOT SEEN MR PARKER SINCE HER INTERVIEW WITH HIM AT WINGFIELD
IT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE SAID LETTIE FROM THE STERN
THE GIRLS HAVE A CRANK EACH OF THEM
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK ON HER FACE ALL THE SAME THOUGHT THE GOOD WOMAN AS SHE TROTTED DOWNSTAIRS
INK
SHE FOUND THE KEY WHICH SHE HAD PUT IN THE TOP DRAWER OF HER WARDROBE AND GAVE IT TO ANNIE
PERHAPS THE WORLD WOULD APPRECIATE THEM ALL THE MORE FOR THEIR LITTLE ECCENTRICITIES
I DARE NOT
I SAVED IT
I'D DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD FOR YOU MY DEAR
IT CUT TOO SORE
YES I LOVE HIM STILL
IT IS HARD TO GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT SYMPATHY AND I GET LITTLE IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL GIVE YOU PLENTY IN THE FUTURE IF I WILL ALLOW YOU
SHE MUST CAST AWAY HER CRUTCH AND STAND ALONE HEAR
HE FOLLOWED LESLIE INTO ANNIE'S PRESENCE
YOU SEE THEY ARE ALL EIGHTEEN
EVERY STUDENT IS TO BE IN EAST HALL AT HALF-PAST EIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER REPLIED ANNIE WHETHER IT IS AN ORDER OR NOT
MRS AND MISS ACHESON WERE BOTH SOUND SLEEPERS
I SAW YOU TALKING TO A MAN SAID BELLE
THOSE THEREFORE WHO CONTEMPLATED GOING OUT MUST SEND WORD TO THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO POSTPONE THEIR VISITS MISS PENROSE THEN IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE HALL AND THE GIRLS WENT INTO THE CENTRAL HALL AND STOOD ABOUT DISCUSSING THE SUDDEN SUMMONS
GOOD-BY GOOD-BY LESLIE WENT TO THE DOOR AND BELLE SAW HER OFF
DOES IT HELP HER THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT FLUSH ON YOUR CHEEKS AND THAT FROWN BETWEEN YOUR BROWS
I FOLLOWED YOU THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST
I WILL DO MY VERY BEST SAID LESLIE
ON HIS WAY OUT HE SPOKE TO HIS HEAD CLERK
AMONGST THEM ARE TO BE FOUND POLYBIUS APPIAN'S CIVIL WAR BOOK 1 CICERO'S LETTERS PLATO'S REPUBLIC BACON'S NOVUM ORGANUM ARISTOTLE'S POLITICS LOCKE ON THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AND GOOD GRACIOUS LETTIE WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THIS EXCLAMATION
HE WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
EILEEN CHETWYND MET HER IN THE QUADRANGLE AND RAN UP EAGERLY
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE
YOU WON'T IF YOU ARE SILENT AND KEEP TO YOUR SIDE OF THE ROOM
HOW DO YOU DO SHE SAID ABRUPTLY
SHE HEARD THE GRATING NOISE OF A SMALL DIAMOND AGAINST THE GLASS
CAN'T YOU GUESS I GUESS PARTLY REPLIED THE GIRL
NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE LESLIE
BUT I REALLY THINK I SHALL DO IT NOW
YOU GO AWAY FROM US I KNOW MY DARLING AND I SHALL MISS YOU TERRIBLY
ROSALIND AT REDGATE
I SHALL LONG TO HEAR OF YOUR DEAR GIRLS AND ALSO TO SEE THEM SHE SAID AS SHE SIPPED HER TEA AND STIRRED IT SLOWLY WITH A SMALL RUSSIAN SPOON
IT WOULD BE VERY BAD SAID LESLIE
HER ACCOMPANIMENT WAS FRESH AND RIPPLING HER VOICE CLEAR NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG BUT WONDERFULLY TRUE
THE MIND MY DEAR GIRLS--THAT IS THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE STUDENTS AT ST WODE'S COLLEGE--HAVE SUCH DEEP PROBLEMS TO SOLVE THAT THEY CANNOT BE FRETTED BY EXTERNAL WORRIES
WHERE IS HE STAYING ANNIE TURNED STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT AND UTTERED AS IF SHE WAS CHARGING THE WORDS OUT OF A CANNON
THIS BEING ARRANGED SHE WAS ABLE TO GO TO ST WODE'S AT THE BEGINNING OF TRINITY TERM
BUT AS A RULE I NEVER SEE ANYONE HERE EXCEPT ON BUSINESS THIS IS TRULY A MATTER OF BUSINESS HAS MISS COLCHESTER ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT YES THEN I HAD BETTER SEE YOU ALONE
IN ANY CASE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN TO WISH FOR ANOTHER ROOM AND TO GET IT ALSO NEXT TERM
I AM ALMOST A MAN LESLIE
MY DEAR DEAR RIDICULOUS CHILDREN SOCIETY WILL SOON KNOCK ALL THAT NONSENSE OUT OF YOUR HEADS
YOU OBSERVE THE FACT OF ITS EXISTENCE IN THE DULL AND FRIVOLOUS EXPRESSION WHICH LOOKS OUT OF SO MANY EYES IN THE POOR AIMS WHICH ANIMATE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE IGNOBLE LIVES THEY LEAD
HOW YOU DISAPPOINT ME WHETHER YOU BUY THINGS OR NOT EILEEN DO COME WITH ME SAID LETTIE
YOU GET MRS ACHESON TO LEND YOU TWENTY POUNDS
HOW EARLY YOU ARE SAID LESLIE
YES WELL SHUT THE DOOR WON'T YOU LESLIE DID SO
IF I GET THROUGH MY PASS EXAM I SHALL CONSIDER THAT I AM DOING ADMIRABLY
YOU MUST EAT ONE
ARE THINGS REALLY AS BAD AS THAT HE CRIED
COLLEGE GIRLS TOO HAVE TOLD ME
SHE IS SURE TO WANT THINGS FOR HER ROOM JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID EILEEN
THE MAN WHO TRIED TO STEAL THE WOODEN BOX LAST NIGHT WAS MY BROTHER RUPERT
FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT ALLOWANCE YOU WILL GIVE US BOTH YOUR FATHER MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY WILL SAID MRS CHETWYND
ANNIE WENT AND STOOD BY THE OPEN WINDOW
MY DEAR CHILD HAS THE BEST EDUCATION I COULD GIVE HER CONTINUED MRS GILROY
CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE IS SHIELDING SOMEONE
I HAVE ARRANGED ABOUT MY WORK AND MEAN TO STUDY HARD AFTER DINNER TO-NIGHT YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH CHANCE OF THAT SAID A MERRY VOICE AND JANE HERIOT CAME UP
BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO LOOK PRETTY AND CHARMING WHY MY DEAR I HAVE MORE MONEY THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
FOURTEEN SHILLINGS SHE SAID IN A WHISPER
AND NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HAVING A NICE DRIVE
THE FURNITURE WAS ALSO CREAMY WHITE WITH BRASS FITTINGS
I HAVE TO TAKE GERMAN LITERATURE FROM 1500 TO THE DEATH OF GOETHE SAID LESLIE
SHE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING MORE NOT EVEN I AM SORRY FOR YOU BUT SHE KEPT ON REPEATING THE THERE DARLING THERE UNTIL MARJORIE LIKE A TIRED BABY CLOSED HER EYES AND ACTUALLY DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP
ARE THE GRACES FORGOTTEN BY THE MODERN WOMAN WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE DEBATE THAT EVENING
NOW I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU ANY MORE
GIRLS ARGUED FOR MISS FRERE AND AGAINST MISS FRERE
I DO CHILD
BUT REALLY BELLE ACHESON YOU ARE TOO ABSURD FOR ANYTHING BELLE CLOSED HER EYES AND SLIGHTLY TURNED HER BACK UPON LETTIE
I WENT TO YOUR ROOMS IN NORTH HALL AND HEARD THAT YOU WERE HERE
MARJORIE PATTED HER ON THE ARM
BUT I DO WISH TO BE KIND TO BELLE FOR I THINK SHE HAS GOOD POINTS IN HER
AS SHE SPOKE A DESPERATE IDEA CAME INTO MY HEAD
A MAN'S WOMAN
SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER OWN PAPER HAVING GOT MIXED UP WITH MINE
MRS GILROY'S FACE LOOKED WHITE
OH YES IT IS A VERY FULL LIFE AND THOSE DERIVE MOST BENEFIT FROM THE COLLEGE WHO ENTER INTO IT IN ITS DIVERS BRANCHES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL THAT SOCIAL FRIVOLITY WILL NOT SUIT ME SAID MARJORIE BREAKING THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED JANE'S RAPID FLOW OF WORDS
I THOUGHT SHE BEGAN
SHE HEARD HIS RETREATING FOOTSTEPS AS HE WENT ALONG THE TOWING-PATH TO WINGFIELD
BUT NOT EVEN TO MARJORIE OR EILEEN HAVE I YET CONFIDED IT I WILL RESPECT YOUR SECRET AND I AM VERY GLAD YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME REPLIED LESLIE FOR SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT NOTHING WOULD DO THIS QUEER GIRL MORE GOOD THAN TO HAVE A CONFIDANTE
WHEN PRETTY GIRLS ARE ABOUT AND YOUNG MEN TO THE FORE WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THAT SORT OF THING MEANS YOU OUGHT TO COME HERE FOR A TIME MR PARKER
BUT IF ANYBODY ATTEMPTS TO TIDY THEM WOE BETIDE MY COMFORT IN THE FUTURE
SHE WILL GET INTO AN AWFUL SCRAPE I BELIEVE SHE IS ILL AND DOES NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT SHE IS SAYING CONTINUED LESLIE
WHAT IS TO BE DONE SHE THOUGHT
SHE RAN QUICKLY DOWNSTAIRS TO THE COMMON ROOM WHERE HER VISITOR WAS WAITING FOR HER
BUT HE INSTANTLY TOOK HIS CUE FROM BELLE AND DECLINED IT WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND
BELIEVE ME I AM NEVER MISTAKEN IN MY JUDGMENT OF ANYONE
ANYTHING FOR A QUIET LIFE SIGHED MARJORIE
HE WILL IF IT IS RIGHT THEN LET US GO STRAIGHT OFF TO A CHURCH AND ASK HIM
THERE IS TO BE THE MOST ABSOLUTE QUIET AND FRESH STRAW HAS BEEN ORDERED TO BE PUT DOWN IN THE STREET
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN ORDINARY BROTHER AND SISTER TO EACH OTHER
I WISH BELLE ACHESON WOULD COME IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT TELL HER HOW GOD HEARD OUR PRAYERS
HAVE NOT YOU STRENGTH ENOUGH FOR THAT MUCH
I WISH TO MENTION SHE SAID THAT MISS LAUDERDALE EXPECTS YOU ALL TO COME TO EAST HALL AT HALF-PAST EIGHT THIS EVENING
I SHALL RETURN AT MY USUAL HOUR TO-MORROW SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ANNOY THE CHIEF VERY CONSIDERABLY THOUGHT THE CLERK TO HIMSELF AS MR PARKER'S BACK DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE DOORWAY
YOU KNOW WHAT LOVELY EYES EILEEN ALWAYS HAD--SO SOFT IN EXPRESSION SO FULL OF THE SOUL WHICH ANIMATED ALL SHE EVER DID OR THOUGHT OR SAID
GO--YES GO
I CANNOT GO TO THE PICNIC LESLIE
I AM KEEPING BACK THE CRISPEST OF THE HOT CAKES AND THERE IS BUTTERED TOAST IN A COVERED DISH BY THE FIRE LESLIE'S STEPS WERE HEARD RUNNING QUICKLY UPSTAIRS AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
THIS IS THE HEART DOTH FEEL AND ONLY KNOW
SURELY THINGS OF LIVING MOMENT ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WELL I HAPPEN TO BE VERY FOND OF THE CLASSICS MYSELF ANSWERED ANNIE SO I OUGHT NOT TO BLAME BELLE
SUPPOSE I UNDERTAKE THE TIDYING OF THE WHOLE ROOM BUT MY DEAR GOOD CREATURE I LIKE IT UNTIDY
THE WIDOW HELD OUT HER HAND WHICH ANNIE CLASPED
AWAY WITH SHAMS AS BELLE SAID THE LAST WORDS SHE BROUGHT DOWN HER HAND UPON THE TABLE WITH A GREAT CLAP WHICH CAUSED THE GLASS AND BOTTLE OF WATER STANDING UPON IT TO RATTLE OMINOUSLY
SHE DID NOT WANT MONEY FOR ORDINARY DEBTS
IT WAS A CORNER ROOM AND HAD QUEER LITTLE NOOKS AND CRANNIES IN ALL SORTS OF UNEXPECTED PLACES
I AM NOT THE ONE TO LECTURE YOU
I DO NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN BUT I SO EARNESTLY WISH YOU WOULD
SUCH A THING WOULD LOWER ME IN MY OWN EYES
SHE FELT QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SOME TROUBLE WAS GOING TO BE REVEALED TO HER
WE DON'T HAVE EM BETTER IN THE BUSH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE FINE DEVELOPMENT THAT HARD WORK GIVES
YOU ARE TURNING INTO A PERFECT LITTLE FIEND
I WANT TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU MY BOY CERTAINLY SIR
YOU WOULD NOT SAY THAT IF YOU KNEW HER
IT MEANS SHE REPLIED THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO DO WHAT YOU ASK YOU DON'T
OUR FRIEND'S NAME IS CHARLES PARKER AND HE LIVED FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS IN SYDNEY THE SAME
SHE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO HER PUT HER HAND UNDER ANNIE'S CHIN AND LIFTED UP THE BLUSHING FACE
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE CHANGED HIS TACTICS
SHE SLIPPED SOFTLY OUT OF BED UNFASTENED HER DOOR WITHOUT MAKING ANY NOISE AND GLIDED DOWN THROUGH THE SILENT HOUSE
OF COURSE YOU HAVE YES SAID LESLIE AND A VERY HARD-WORKING AND CLEVER MOTHER TOO
WILL YOU GO AND FIND MOTHER AND ASK HER TO LET YOU STAY WITH ME COULD WE NOT RING THE BELL AND TELL THE SERVANT AND PERHAPS YOUR MOTHER WOULD COME HERE BUT I WON'T HAVE HER IN THE ROOM
BUT I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE OF THE LEAST USE
SHE CRUSHED THE LETTER UP TIGHT THRUST IT INTO HER POCKET AND SAID ABRUPTLY WHAT IS THE HOUR IT IS QUITE LATE--BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN I DON'T CARE
WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF LIBERTY HERE
THEY WENT SLOWLY ACROSS THE QUADRANGLE ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THEIR ROOM
OF COURSE WE SHOULD NEVER THINK OF MARRYING
IT'S A FARTHING A LESSON AND THE MONEY TO GO TO THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN
I NEVER FELT LESS IN SYMPATHY WITH BELLE THAN I DO AT THIS MOMENT SHE SAID
AS HE DID SO HE NODDED TO ANNIE
BUT IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE WHY OH DON'T MR PARKER CRIED LESLIE
SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BY ANNIE'S SIDE AND PUT HER ARMS ROUND HER
NOW THEN LET'S JOIN HANDS AND FLY DOWNSTAIRS OH YES WE ARE FEARFULLY LATE AND THE OTHERS HAVE GONE INTO THE DINING HALL WELL COME THIS WAY SAID ANNIE
YES MISS ACHESON I AGREE WITH YOU
SHE TURNED ROUND IN AN ACCESS OF TERROR THEN A CRY OF MINGLED ASTONISHMENT FEAR AND DELIGHT BURST FROM HER AND THE NEXT INSTANT SHE HAD CLASPED HER ARMS ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK
THEN KNEELING DOWN SHE SOFTLY UNFASTENED THE BEDCLOTHES AND BEGAN TO RUB THE GIRL'S FEET
I WANT HIM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
YOU WERE NOT PUTTING IT ON WERE YOU ANNIE OF COURSE NOT ANSWERED ANNIE
A MOMENT LATER THE GREAT TEA-MERCHANT FOUND HIMSELF IN THE STREET THE NEXT HE HAD HAILED A HANSOM AND GIVEN THE ADDRESS OF MRS GILROY'S HOUSE IN WEST KENSINGTON
THEY HAD NOT TO WAIT LONG
I DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THEM
WHAT AM I TO DO
FOR HER CLOTHES WHICH SHE HAD TELEGRAPHED TO HER LATE LANDLADY TO FORWARD HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER ANNIE READ THIS LETTER TWICE
THANK YOU MOTHER DEAR YOU MEAN TO USE YOUR DRESS-CUPBOARD AS A DARKROOM FOR PHOTOGRAPHY SAID MRS CHETWYND
CHAPTER XXXI--HANDWRITING
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME TO MR PARKER TO MR PARKER AND WITH YOU
BUT FINALLY WHEN THE SUMMING-UP WAS OVER MISS FRERE WAS ABLE TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD A SMALL VICTORY ON HER SIDE
WHAT WAS THE MATTER
IT WOULD NOT BE ENDURABLE THEY REACHED THE BOATS
SHE HEARD THE SERVANTS GOING UP TO THEIR ATTICS OVERHEAD
I LIKED YOU VERY MUCH YESTERDAY BUT I FEEL NOW THAT YOU ARE WATCHING ME ALL THE TIME AND I CAN'T STAND IT
I WONDER WHO IT CAN BE MRS GILROY STARTED
I WAS STANDING NEAR THE BOAT-HOUSE WHEN YOU LANDED WITH--WITH YOU SAW US CRIED ANNIE
REALLY WHEN I THINK OF ALL THAT YOU TWO GIRLS ARE DOING TO OPPOSE ME AND RENDER MY LIFE MISERABLE I COULD ALMOST WISH THAT YOU WERE BACK AT SCHOOL OF COURSE MOTHER SAID EILEEN GRAVELY IF YOU POSITIVELY FORBID ME TO GO I WILL OBEY YOU SHE SAT DOWN ON THE NEAREST CHAIR AND STARED HARD AT HER MOTHER
BELLE'S EYES FLASHED
DON'T FAIL TO BE WITH ME BETWEEN HALF-PAST TWO AND THREE LESLIE PROMISED
I SHALL TELL HER THAT I HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE HEADACHE I COULD NOT HOLD MY HEAD UP
THERE ARE TWO ATTICS ON THE SAME FLOOR WITH THIS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT HAD YOU GIVEN ME THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR AFFAIRS
I CONGRATULATE YOU MA'AM IN POSSESSING HIM
SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GIVE IT TO ME AT FIRST FOR SHE SAID YOU WERE STAYING IN A HOUSE OF ILLNESS
WHY WAS I EVER BORN SHE UTTERED A PIERCING CRY AND FELL FORWARD ON HER FACE AND HANDS
BUT IT WAS A GREAT EFFORT
LET ME IN THERE WAS NO REPLY
WE WILL GO AT ONCE SAID LESLIE
NEVER CONSIDERING THAT MARJORIE'S CHIN WITH ITS CLEFT IN THE MIDDLE WAS FULL OF OBSTINACY AND THAT HER LIPS WERE AS FIRM AS THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL
I WILL COME DOWNSTAIRS HER FACE WAS WHITE AS DEATH
I DID NOT SAY WHO I WAS
GIVE ME HIS ADDRESS DEAR BEFORE YOU GO SAID MRS ACHESON
BUT I PROMISE HERE WILLINGLY BEFORE GOD THAT I WILL NOT TELL WHAT ANNIE HAS DONE IF YOU ON YOUR PART WILL MAKE ME A PROMISE WHAT IS IT SAID COLCHESTER
BESIDES EVEN IF IT WERE NOT HOPELESS THERE IS NOTHING VACANT
I CAME HERE TO STUDY LITERATURE REPLIED LESLIE
MOTHER IS ASLEEP SHE SAID
YOU WILL STAY NOW WON'T YOU
THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FRIENDS WHO ARE CERTAIN TO COME AND SEE ME TO-NIGHT AND I SHOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THEM JUST AS THE TWO GIRLS WERE ABOUT TO ASCEND THE STAIRS THEY MET EILEEN AND MARJORIE WHO ARM IN ARM WERE LOOKING AT THE REGULATION BOARD
BUT APPEARANCES ARE MUCH AGAINST HER HE OPENED A CERTAIN DRAWER IN A CABINET WHICH STOOD BEHIND HIS DESK TOOK FROM IT A LETTER AND BEGAN TO READ
I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS IN ME TO FEEL SO BAD ABOUT ANYTHING
SO THERE'S NO OBLIGATION ON YOUR PART NOR ON YOURS EITHER MISS LESLIE A DEBT YOU OWE SAID MRS GILROY IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
AND I AM IN GOOD SPIRITS VERY GOOD INDEED
THE DEAREST SWEETEST WOMAN ON EARTH
OH LEAVE ME OUT
CHAPTER IX--ONE TAKEN THE OTHER LEFT
PERHAPS HE DID NOT LIKE TO TELL YOU MY LOVE
THE DOCTORS WERE RATHER ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
I ALMOST WISH DEAR OLD LEW HAD BEEN MATHEMATICAL THEN PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT WAS WHY I WAS A LITTLE LATE
BLINDS TO THE WINDOWS I GRANT ARE REQUIRED OR PEOPLE MIGHT STARE IN
IN TREMBLING AND SICK FEAR LESLIE FOLLOWED DREADING EACH MOMENT TO HEAR THE KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK AND YET ANXIOUS TO GIVE ANNIE TIME TO ESCAPE TO HER ROOM BEFORE SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE
HE WANTED MONEY
A COLLEGE AFTER TENNYSON'S IDEA WILL BE REALIZED BY ME WHERE THOSE GIRLS WHO WISH TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES WHOLLY AND COMPLETELY TO STUDY SHALL LIVE THEIR LIVES
THE MOON WAS STILL UP AND ITS LIGHT FELL ACROSS THE ROOM
YOU ALWAYS WERE AFFECTIONATE
IF I GET MATHEMATICS ON THE BRAIN I ALWAYS GO THE WHOLE LENGTH AND THAT MEANS PACING THE FLOOR AND MUMBLING PROBLEMS TO MYSELF SOMETIMES FOR HOURS
BUT IT WOULD ME FOR I AM DIFFERENTLY MADE
I WAS THE FIRST TO SUGGEST A THING AND THEN EILEEN FOLLOWED SUIT
AWFUL IS THE WORD TO USE
WHO ARE THOSE TWO GIRLS SAID JANE HERIOT SUDDENLY
I GOT UP EVERY MORNING AN HOUR EARLIER THAN THE OTHERS DURING THE WHOLE OF LAST TERM SIMPLY BECAUSE I INTENDED TO PLAY THAT FUGUE OF BACH'S TO YOU IT WAS A GREAT PITY DEAR BEGAN MRS CHETWYND
YOU CAN BUY YARDS OF HOLLAND AND ANY OTHER STIFF DISAGREEABLE PRICKY MATERIAL YOU LIKE AND WORK AWAY IN YOUR LEISURE HOURS WHEN THE REST OF US ARE HAVING FUN
AS A RULE IT WAS LESLIE'S TASK AND PRIVILEGE TO GET TEA FOR THEM BOTH
SHE WEDGED IN THE HARD-BOILED EGGS RAISED PIES ROAST CHICKENS SANDWICHES AND THE SWEETS
WHY WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR ANNIE FOR ANNIE'S EYES HAD DROPPED ON TO HER PLATE AND HER FACE LOOKED LIKE DEATH
HE AND YOUR FATHER HAD NOT MET FOR MANY YEARS AND IN AUSTRALIA THEY LEAD A DIFFERENT LIFE
LESLIE HAD ALWAYS FOUND PRAYER EASY
BUT THE FURNITURE IN THE ROOM IS GOOD AND NEAT
WAS SHE NOT THERE NO REPLIED LESLIE
AND NOW YOU ARE ACCOMMODATED WITH SOME OF THE NICEST ROOMS IN COLLEGE OH NEVER MIND
HE HAD GOT INTO FRESH AWFUL TROUBLE
SHE IS REALLY I ASSURE YOU ONE OF THE TRIALS OF MY LIFE
SHE HAS MORE SENSE THAN TO MAKE HERSELF MISERABLE WHEN SHE NEED NOT I CERTAINLY DO NOT INTEND TO MAKE MYSELF MISERABLE SAID LESLIE
OH MY CHILD NOT A MAN LIVING WILL SPEAK TO THE GIRLS
HAVE YOU A HEADACHE
IT WAS NOW PAST TEN O'CLOCK
YOU ARE TOO PROUD TO TAKE HELP FROM ME I AM SAID LLEWELLYN
NARROW OR NOT I SHOULD HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO DO IT
SHE WAS IN COMPLETE SHADOW AND TRUSTED NO ONE WOULD SEE HER
COME THIS WAY MRS CHETWYND CONVEYED THE GIRLS UPSTAIRS
CHAPTER XXXII--WHO HAS TAKEN THE KEY
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WORE SPECTACLES BELLE SHE SAID
YOU ARE NOT AN ORDINARY GIRL AND CANNOT BE JUDGED BY ORDINARY STANDARDS
CHAPTER XX--NOT A BIT LIKE IT
I WOULDN'T VEX HER NOR GIVE HER ANOTHER CARE FOR ALL THE MONEY I POSSESS
MUSOPHILUS IS A LOVER OF THE MUSE
MY DRESS IS ONLY SUITABLE SHE REPEATED
AND THIS THIS IS A CUP OF COLD WATER WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LESLIE
BUT YOU WANT MY ADVICE NOW AS TO WHAT YOU WILL DO
AND IF YOU THINK I AM GOING TO LET MYSELF IN FOR IT YOU ARE MISTAKEN
THE BOY LOOKS INTELLIGENT TOO
THERE IS THAT GREAT PARK IN THE DISTANCE AND THE RIVER DOWN THERE
WHAT IS YOUR ADDRESS ANNIE
IT WOULD NOT BE VERY INTERESTING TO LOOK AT LETITIA ASLEEP
THAT LLEWELLYN WILL DO HIM CREDIT IF HE SENDS HIM TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE
HER WIDOW'S DRESS WAS CAREFULLY CHOSEN--NOT TOO DEPRESSING BUT ALL THAT WAS CORRECT AND PROPER
I THINK MARJORIE AND EILEEN ARE A LITTLE OVEREXCITED AT GETTING HOME AND IF YOU WILL EXCUSE PRAY MOTHER DO NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID EILEEN
IS IT NOT GOOD MAMMY DEAR TO HAVE A GROWN-UP DAUGHTER ON WHOM TO LEAN BUT IF THE GROWN-UP DAUGHTER WON'T BE LEANT ON CRIED POOR MRS CHETWYND
WHY LESLIE GILROY YOU ARE QUITE GLARING AT ME
SIT DOWN ANNIE ANNIE DID NOT SIT
BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF GIRLS LIKE US
AS SHE WAS RETURNING TO THE COLLEGE SHE WAS MET BY MARJORIE AND EILEEN WHO STOPPED HER TO SPEAK EAGERLY ABOUT MISS LAUDERDALE'S SCHEME OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
IF YOU WANT MONEY COME TO ME STRAIGHT
WHEN DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED THE TWO GIRLS ENTERED THE DINING-ROOM TOGETHER
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH THEM I DON'T THINK WE SHALL HAVE TIME FOR THAT REPLIED BELLE
SHE WAS GLAD OF THIS IF SHE COULD BE SAID TO BE GLAD OF ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT
HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MY DEAR FATHER'S AND MOTHER COULD NOT HELP ACCEPTING HIS GENEROUS OFFER
LET ME COME IN ANNIE SHE CALLED OUT
BUT I WILL ADMIT THAT I AM STRUGGLING VERY HARD WITH THAT OBJECT IN VIEW THEN LET ME HELP YOU
SHE TURNED ANOTHER PAGE OF HER NOVEL AND READ ON CONTENTEDLY
HE WANTED MORE AND MORE MONEY
AND I DOUBT MUCH IF THE MISSUS WILL ALLOW HER YOUNG LADIES TO GO A-VISITING YOU IN FOX BUILDINGS WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS REPLIED THE COACHMAN IF MISS EILEEN AND MISS MARJORIE ARE LIKE WHAT THEY USED TO BE WHEN THEY WAS YOUNG I DON'T THINK THE MISSUS WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT THEM HAVING THEIR OWN WAY HE WHIPPED UP HIS HORSES AS HE SPOKE AND A FEW MINUTES LATER THE GIRLS HAD REACHED HOME
HER HAIR WAS RUMPLED HER CHEEKS SLIGHTLY FLUSHED
SHE WAS A MUSICIAN OF RARE POWER AND LESLIE LISTENED WITH HER HEART IN HER EYES
BUT AT LAST SHE CONSENTED
I HAVE SPOKEN TO LESLIE GILROY
EILEEN TOOK THAT HORRIBLE FEVER IN THE BUILDINGS WHERE THE COACHMAN LIVES NOT A DOUBT OF IT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TYPHOID FEVER WAS REALLY INFECTIOUS SAID LESLIE
BE SURE OF THIS THAT ANYTHING YOU MAY HAPPEN TO SAY TO ME ABOUT ANNIE WILL HAVE MY MOST TENDER CONSIDERATION AND MY DEEPEST INTEREST
ONE THING IS DELIGHTFUL IN THIS ROOM SAID EILEEN RUNNING UP TO THE WINDOW AS SHE SPOKE
THE FRIEND WHO DOES NOT WISH TO SEE US IN OUR SERGE COSTUMES WE DO NOT INTEND TO CULTIVATE THERE ARE STILL EVENING DRESSES MY DEAR BUT MOTHER YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE US OUT TO DINNERS YOU MUST HAVE ONE OR TWO DINNER DRESSES SAID MRS CHETWYND AND THAT IS AN END OF THE MATTER
WE WILL ESCHEW MARRIAGE
SHE WENT HAPPILY UPSTAIRS TO SEE THAT ANNIE'S ROOM WAS NEAT AND COMFORTABLE THE BED WELL AIRED AND ALL THE NECESSARY ACCESSORIES OF A BEDROOM AS THEY OUGHT TO BE
I AM ONLY GRATIFIED TO BE ABLE TO PLEASE YOU IN ANY WAY
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND MY BOY
I AM QUITE WELL I THANK YOU MISS HE REPLIED
BY THE WAY MISS LESLIE I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT FINE YOUNG BROTHER OF YOURS LLEWELLYN
AND I DON'T CARE A PIN ABOUT BEING LEARNED
I KNOW MOTHER'S WAYS SO WELL
OH LEW WITH YOUR TASTES WITH YOUR WISHES WHAT COULD YOU NOT ACHIEVE
BELLE ACHESON WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO NEVER LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER HER FEET
YOU ARE--THE GIRL WHO OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE COME TO ST WODE'S YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN REPLIED LETITIA WITH SPIRIT
I AM MOST ANXIOUS THAT MOTHER SHOULD HAVE THIS ONE DELIGHTFUL HAPPY DAY
YOU MEAN THE BEST BUT IT IS ALL HUMBUG ABOUT YOUR GETTING THAT SCHOLARSHIP AND MY HE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY
AND YET I POSSESS ONLY FOUR SHILLINGS IN THE WORLD
IT IS ABSURD TO KEEP GIRLS AT SCHOOL AFTER EIGHTEEN
YOU OUGHT TO GO TO HUNT'S IN THE BROAD TO-MORROW
WE HAVE NO IDEA OF HAVING OUR OWN MOTHER FAGGED TO DEATH
THEY BOTH ENTERED THE HOUSE
SHE MAY HAVE MUCH TO DO YET IN HER LIFE ON EARTH IF SHE IS SPARED I SHALL BECOME RELIGIOUS AT ONCE SAID MARJORIE
NOW MRS CHETWYND COULD NEVER ANSWER ANY ARGUMENT WHICH REQUIRED A LOGICAL DEDUCTION
YOUR BROW HAS QUITE A HAGGARD LOOK
YOU MUST HAVE TEA WITH ME TO-MORROW IN MY ROOM
AND YOUNG FORREST HIMSELF GOES TO ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY HER QUIET WAS OVER
I SHALL ORDER THEIR COURT DRESSES TO-MORROW
IT IS NO USE SAID LESLIE
IF ONLY PRETTY GRACEFUL ACCOMPLISHED LETITIA WERE MY OWN DAUGHTER
AND WHEN LESLIE'S SOFT VOICE SAID I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU MARJORIE HER ONLY REPLY WAS TO CLUTCH THE PILLOW ROUND WHICH SHE HAD CLASPED HER ARMS MORE CONVULSIVELY THAN EVER AND TO SAY IN A CHOKING VOICE I WISH LETTIE WOULD GO AWAY
BUT NOW LESLIE WHAT IS THE TROUBLE
WELL I'LL COME WITH YOU FOR MY ROOM IS IN THE SAME CORRIDOR
FEW GIRLS WOULD BE NOBLE ENOUGH OH YOU DO HER INJUSTICE INTERRUPTED ANNIE
I PITY THE MOTHER THAT I DO
I HAD TO GO TO TOWN ON URGENT BUSINESS
SHE KNOWS MANY FOREIGN LANGUAGES SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF SHREWDNESS IN HER CHARACTER AND WOULD DO YOUR WORK ADMIRABLY
I CAN NEVER TELL
THE WORST OF IT WAS TOO THAT RUPERT HAD GIVEN NO ADDRESS
I DO WISH YOU WERE MATHEMATICAL
CHAPTER XXV--THE PRAYER OF FAITH
COME NOW THAT'S PUTTING IT ON TOO FINE
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM AND SOME DAY YOU WILL BE ASKED WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
PUNCTUAL TO THE HOUR AND IN A SUITABLE EVENING DRESS RUPERT COLCHESTER APPEARED AT THE ACHESONS HOUSE
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY WORK
SOME DAY SHE WILL SEE HER FOLLY
WE MUST START SOON HE SAID
I ALMOST HATE ANNIE COLCHESTER
HE IS GILROY'S BOY AND WORTHY OF HIS FATHER
SHE LOOKED WHEN I SAW HER LAST AS IF IT HAD HALF KILLED HER
TO HER ASTONISHMENT SHE SAW THAT ANNIE COLCHESTER WAS UP
SLEEP WELL THE GIRLS NODDED TO LESLIE THEN TO JANE HERIOT AND THE NEXT MOMENT LESLIE WAS ALSO BIDDING MISS HERIOT GOOD-NIGHT
IF THE VERY WORST OF ALL HAD HAPPENED YOU COULD NOT BE GOING ON MORE TERRIBLY THAN YOU ARE AT PRESENT MARJORIE I CANNOT HELP FEELING IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN SAID MARJORIE
IT'S JUST NOTHING HE CRIED
YOU CANNOT LIVE IN A ROOM THAT CONTAINS NOTHING BUT A CAMP-BED AND A BLIND AND AT PRESENT THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE ADMITTED I HAVE A DESK SPECIALLY MADE FOR MYSELF IN THE WINDOW CONTINUED BELLE
EILEEN MY DEAR I DECLINE TO ARGUE WITH YOU
YOU SHALL SIT NEAR ME AND WE CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME BUT PERHAPS ANNIE WOULD RATHER NOT GO TO THE MUSEUM TO-DAY SAID MRS ACHESON
THE GILROYS LIVED IN A SMALL HOUSE IN WEST KENSINGTON
LESLIE OPENED IT AND FOLLOWED HER
NOW THIS POOR CHILD--HOW VERY THIN SHE IS BELLE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE ROOM
SURELY BELLE YOU CANNOT THINK IT WRONG TO LOOK OUT AT THIS LOVELY VIEW NO NOT WRONG EXACTLY SAID BELLE
ANNIE HE CONTINUED I COULD NOT DO IT
THEY REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE MR PARKER'S OFFICES WERE WENT UPSTAIRS TO THE SECOND FLOOR AND PRESENTLY ENTERED A ROOM WHERE SEVERAL CLERKS WERE BUSY
BEFORE SHE COULD MAKE UP HER MIND WHETHER TO SPEAK OR NOT ANNIE HERSELF CAME FORWARD DREW A CHAIR OPPOSITE TO LESLIE AND SAT DOWN
THE SMALL MAID OF ALL WORK ELFREDA WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO NEAR THE PANTRY
I MEAN TO ASK MISS FRERE ABOUT THE POOR
YOU MEET ME IN THE HALL IN HALF-AN-HOUR SHE DASHED AWAY AND MRS ACHESON BEGAN TO ASK ANNIE SOME IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO HER HEALTH
30 IN THIS SQUARE--NEWBOLT SQUARE IT IS CALLED NO
THE STUDIOUS GIRLS WORK AS A RULE IN THE MORNING PLAY GAMES IN THE AFTERNOON AND WORK AGAIN AFTER DINNER UNTIL WHATEVER HOUR THEY WISH TO GO TO BED
LETITIA'S ROOM WAS IN EXQUISITE AND PERFECT ORDER EVERYTHING PUT NEATLY AWAY AND LETITIA HERSELF LYING IN HER LITTLE WHITE BED WITH HER ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HER CHEST AND HER HAIR SWEPT BACK FROM HER PRETTY BROW
I DARE NOT CONFIDE IN MOTHER
I DID NOT KNOW I WAS STARING AT YOU ANSWERED LESLIE
THERE'S A LOOK ON HER FACE WHICH MAKES IT HARD FOR ANY MAN TO WITHSTAND HER
BUT SURELY YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK OVER BOOKS TO-NIGHT YES I DO
MARJORIE AND EILEEN HOWEVER FIDGETED RUMPLED UP THEIR SHORT LOCKS AND GLANCED IMPATIENTLY ONE AT THE OTHER
NOW MAMMY WHY SHOULD WE BE FASHIONABLE GIRLS IF WE DISLIKE THE IDEA HERE MARJORIE NOTWITHSTANDING HER RUDE WORDS WENT ON HER KNEES WOUND HER STRONG YOUNG ARMS ROUND HER MOTHER'S WAIST AND LOOKED WITH SUCH IMPLORING EYES INTO HER FACE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HER ANGER MRS CHETWYND WAS TOUCHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF
IS IT TO BE CLOGGED AND HINDERED
PERHAPS GOD MEANT YOU TO ACCEPT IT NO DON'T CRIED LLEWELLYN--"DON'T SAY THAT A SPASM OF PAIN FLITTED ACROSS THE BOY'S FACE THEN VANISHED
HE WOULD STOP AT NOTHING TO ACHIEVE HIS OBJECT
WELL AT ANY RATE YOU WON'T WANT MONEY WHILE YOU ARE AT THE ACHESONS YOU MIGHT LET ME HAVE THOSE FEW SHILLINGS
LESLIE FOUND HERSELF ALONE
I SHALL BEGIN MY HOUSE OF LEARNING IN A HUMBLE COTTAGE
SHE HAS INSISTED ON LIVING IN HER SISTER'S ROOM HAS DONE HERSELF NO GOOD AND OH WELL AS YOU SAY THAT IS NATURAL SAID DR HOWARD WHO COULD READ CHARACTER LIKE A BOOK
WHAT IS WRONG ANNIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
SHE THEN THANKED THE GIRLS FOR THEIR POLITE ATTENTION HOPED THAT THOSE WHO DIFFERED FROM HER WOULD BY AND BY SEE MATTERS IN ANOTHER LIGHT AND BROKE UP THE DEBATE
HE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT STAND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAD BEEN BEFOOLED BY A GIRL TWICE AS CLEVER AS HIMSELF
AND A NICE SNUG LITTLE PARLOR YOU HAVE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER
WILL YOU GIVE MY FRIEND ANNIE COLCHESTER SIXTY POUNDS FOR ME AND WILL YOU GIVE IT IN NOTES AND GOLD
AS TO SUNDAY DRESSES CRIED MARJORIE I DON'T SEE WHY NEAT SERGE DRESSES SHOULD NOT DO QUITE WELL FOR CHURCH
CHAPTER XV BELLE'S ROOM AT ST
WHATEVER HAPPENS I CANNOT FACE THE ACHESONS AGAIN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING THE TRUTH WITH THE FIRST DAWN SHE ROSE AND DRESSED AND THEN WROTE A LITTLE NOTE TO MRS ACHESON
HAVE YOU NOT MISS GILROY I HAVE FOUND YOU QUITE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH THE DISCOMFORT OF HAVING ME IN YOUR ROOM ANSWERED LESLIE COLORING AS SHE SPOKE
AND LESLIE HAVING RECEIVED A NOTE FROM HER MOTHER TO SAY THAT SHE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD SHE WAS MAKING HERSELF USEFUL AGREED TO DO SO
I ALWAYS HAD A WONDERFUL ADMIRATION FOR GILROY
A MOMENT OR TWO AFTERWARDS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
BUT I HAPPENED TO SEE THE NAME OF ST WODE'S ON THAT BASKET-TRUNK A MINUTE OR TWO AGO
YOU LITTLE GUESSED WHEN YOU WERE SHRINKING UP IN THAT CORNER OF THE OMNIBUS THAT I WAS ENJOYING A CIGAR ON THE ROOF
THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT THE TYPHOID IS RUNNING A MOST SEVERE COURSE AND THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS A CHANCE OF PNEUMONIA IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE LITTLE PARLOR--THEY ALWAYS SAT IN THE PARLOR IN THE EVENINGS--WAS LOOKING AS SNUG AND COMFORTABLE AS A ROOM COULD LOOK
MY HEAD IS VERY BAD
I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ONE AS JANE SPOKE SHE GLANCED TOWARD ANNIE COLCHESTER WHO LOOKED BACK AT HER AND NODDED
OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY FEEL THAT I WORRY YOU I HAD BETTER LEAVE YOU ALONE YOU DO ANNOY ME DREADFULLY
SHE HAD ANOTHER REASON AND SHE WOULD NOT DIVULGE IT
I LAUGH NOW WHEN I THINK OF HOW YOU MANAGED BEFORE--FORGING A LETTER IN ANOTHER GIRL'S NAME AND TAKING IT TO PARKER OF ALL PEOPLE AND PARKER GIVING THE MONEY AND BLAMING THAT BREAD-AND-BUTTER MISS GILROY AND YOU AND I GETTING OFF SCOT-FREE
YOU ARE FOND OF LESLIE IT DOES NOT MATTER TO YOU WHETHER I CARE FOR HER OR NOT
LESLIE AND I WERE ROOMFELLOWS
CHAPTER XXI--WHAT IS UP
NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF THIS IS A LITTLE GAME WHICH SOME GOOD PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HIDE FROM CHARLES PARKER THEY WILL QUICKLY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG BOX CHAPTER XXXII WHO HAS TAKEN THE KEY
SHE TUMBLED INTO BED DID NOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HER PRAYERS FLUNG HER HEAD ON THE PILLOW AND CLOSED HER EYES
NO GIRL WHO HAS A NOBLE BROTHER LIKE LLEWELLYN OUGHT TO SHRINK AT ANYTHING
THERE WERE MANY RELICS OF BYGONE RESPECTABILITY NAY OF BYGONE WEALTH IN THE GILROYS HUMBLE HOUSE
I HAVE COME HERE IT IS TRUE MR COLCHESTER
BESIDES AS YOU DOUBTLESS OBSERVE MY GOOD GIRL THERE IS NO ARRANGEMENT NECESSARY
PLEASE SPEAK MR PARKER HAD OBSERVED HER AGITATION AND HE NOW WHISPERED TO HIMSELF
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY WISH ME BEFORE YOU CAME I HAD LIBERTY INTERRUPTED ANNIE
THINK WHAT AN AWFUL RESPONSIBILITY IS PLACED IN YOUR HANDS
EILEEN WILL GET WELL AGAIN
BY THE WAY HERE IT IS DON'T SHOW IT TO ME SAID LESLIE SUDDENLY
A MAN WAS STANDING ON THE WINDOW-SILL
REALLY BELLE--I MEAN MISS ACHESON YOU CAN CALL ME BELLE WHILE YOU ARE HERE
SHE CAME UP TO LESLIE AND TRIED TO PUT HER HAND ACROSS HER MOUTH
HOW COULD SHE TAKE THE SIN OF ANOTHER AND BEAR IT BRAVELY ON HER YOUNG SHOULDERS
I HAVE BEEN TO WIESBADEN TO THE CELEBRATED OCULIST AND HE HAS ORDERED THESE SPECIAL GLASSES
AND ONCE AGAIN HEAR SUDDENLY SAID THE SHARP VOICE OF BELLE ACHESON
ANNIE COULD NOT HELP CHEERING UP AFTER A LITTLE IN THE SUNSHINE OF THIS RARE KINDNESS
SO AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR HIM
I RESPECT HER MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY AFTER THE SPEECHES FROM THE OPENER AND THE OPPOSITION THE DEBATE PROCEEDED WITH ENTHUSIASM
LLEWELLYN DEAR WILL YOU GO AND OPEN THE HALL DOOR LLEWELLYN STRODE ACROSS THE ROOM
WELL MARJORIE YOU AT LEAST PLAY SAID HER MOTHER
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SPRING WHEN WE WENT OUT TOGETHER AND PICKED PRIMROSES AND THAT TIME WHEN YOU HAD THE MEASLES AND I WAS SO AWFULLY GOOD TO YOU
THAT IS REFRESHING SHE CRIED AS SHE PLACED HER GLASS ON THE TRAY
THE ONLY THING IS THAT THEY LOOK AT LIFE FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STANDPOINT
WHAT DO YOU TAKE WHEN YOU HAVE BAD HEADACHES NOTHING ANSWERED ANNIE
WELL I MUST NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME TALKING
FLORRIE SMART HELD OUT HER HAND AND GAVE LESLIE AN AFFECTIONATE PRESSURE ON HER ARM
WHAT DO YOU WANT TWO TRUNKS FOR
I HAVE COME HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU
MOTHER MAY NOT LIKE IT AT FIRST BUT SHE WILL SOON LEARN TO KNOW ONCE FOR ALL THAT MARJORIE AND I MEAN TO FOLLOW OUR OWN BENT
DOESN'T IT LOOK TEMPTING SAID MABEL SMACKING HER LIPS
WILL YOU GET IT NO WINE FOR ME THANK YOU MA'AM
IT WILL MAKE AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE TO ME THEN SHE WALKED ON SWAYING SLIGHTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
BUT MY BRAIN NEARLY WENT IN THE EFFORT
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MONEY IS THE NEST-EGG FOR SOME GOOD PURPOSE I AM SURE REPLIED LESLIE
GET UP ANNIE
OH IT IS NOT THAT I CARE FOR MONEY NOT A BIT
BUT I AM WILLING TO SAY THIS MUCH
LETTIE RUN UPSTAIRS FOR MOTHER'S EAU DE COLOGNE
I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LET YOU BY THIS TIME THE ASTONISHED AND DISCOMFITED MAN HAD FOUND HIS VOICE
IT IS SOMETIMES PERMITTED FOR THOSE WHOSE SOULS ARE AKIN TO CLASP THEIR EARTHLY HANDS TOGETHER
COME HERE CHILD COME HERE
BUT I DO FEEL THAT THE SOUL IS MORE COMFORTABLE AND MORE LIKELY TO THRIVE IF IT IS LODGED IN A NICELY CARED FOR BODY
WE ARE SOLITARY IN OUR LABOR
I SHALL GLADLY REJOICE IN THE THOUGHT OF MY PAST SUFFERING IF IT CAN HELP ANNIE NOW YOU WANT A FAVOR FOR HER I DO
BUT I SEE IT IS NOT HERE AND I MUST ONLY DO IT OVER AGAIN
BUT HE AND I MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE PRESENT
WHY YOU LOOK QUITE WORRIED YOU DEAR OLD THING
I ASSURE YOU ERICSON THIS YOUNG LADY'S PULSE IS BOUNDING AT SUCH A RATE THAT WE SHALL HAVE HER IN A FEVER IF WE DON'T LOOK OUT
THE THREE GIRLS ENTERED
SHE WAS AMAZED WHEN I TOLD HER YOU WERE GOING TO INDIA AH SAID RUPERT THOUGHTFULLY TAPPING THE BACK OF HIS HEEL AGAINST THE BRASS RAIL OF THE FIREPLACE I FELT SURE SHE WOULD FEEL IT DREADFULLY
IN ORDER TO AVOID SUCH A CATASTROPHE SHE DIVIDED HER HOURS CAREFULLY ALLOWING A CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR RECREATION AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT ALSO FOR THE GUIDING OF HER WAYWARD COMPANION TO WHOM AS THE DAYS WENT ON SHE BECAME REALLY ATTACHED
HOW BRAVE OF DEAR ANNIE
HE SOUGHT ME OUT
NEVER MIND--HERE THIS PIN WILL SET IT FINALLY RIGHT DO STOP FOR A MOMENT BELLE
IN THE MORNING ANNIE GOT UP LOOKING MUCH AS USUAL BUT HAVING NOT THE SLIGHTEST REMEMBRANCE OF THE LITTLE SCENE THROUGH WHICH BOTH SHE AND HER ROOMFELLOW HAD LIVED DURING THE NIGHT
WHAT A TERRIBLE GIRL SHE IS I LIKE HER REPLIED LESLIE
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND BOTH DOCTORS WENT IN
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
OH WHY WAS LIFE SO DIFFERENT FOR HER TO WHAT IT WAS FOR OTHER GIRLS
WE WILL HAVE TEA AT TWICKENHAM AND GO HOME IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW JOLLY EVERYTHING IS
ONE OR TWO GIRLS SPOKE TO US AT DINNER BUT IN THAT CASE YOU HAD BETTER COME AND JOIN MY PARTY SAID JANE
AH SHE SAID I ALSO HAVE THE SAME TASTES
ANNIE HAD NEARLY REACHED IT WHEN SHE FELT A HAND LAID LIGHTLY ON HER SHOULDER
A STORY OF CALIFORNIA
YOU ARE TO GO AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT ME
HE DID NOT WANT HIS MOTHER TO OBSERVE IT HOWEVER AND HE WENT SLOWLY TO THE DOOR
LET ME LEAN AGAINST YOU LESLIE WENT UP TO HER
IT LOOKED ON TO A FAIR-SIZED GARDEN
SHE WAS RICH AND WAS ALSO GOOD-HEARTED GOOD-NATURED AND PLEASANT
THE ONE ROPE SHE HAD TO CLING TO WAS A BLIND SENSE OF HONOR
THE FOOTMAN REPLIED TO HER SUMMONS SAID THAT MISS EILEEN WAS VERY ILL INDEED AND THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE YOUNG LADY COULD BE ADMITTED BUT IF SHE PARTICULARLY WISHED IT HE WOULD GO AND INQUIRE
IF WE HAD STAYED AT HOME WE SHOULD HAVE GONE IN FOR ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS
THEY OVERHEARD LESLIE'S LAST SOMEWHAT DESPAIRING WORDS GLANCED AT ONE ANOTHER AND SMILED
SHE IS A DEAR CHILD AND YET I CANNOT QUITE CORDIALLY TAKE TO HER THOUGHT THE WIDOW
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT HESITATING
NOW TO ALLOW THOSE WILD IMPS THOSE IRRESPONSIBLE GIRLS TO HAVE THEIR OWN WAY IS NOT TO BE HEARD OF FOR A SINGLE MOMENT WELL AUNT HELEN I AM SURE IT WILL COME RIGHT IN THE END
FROM THAT MOMENT SHE BELIEVED IN MISS FRERE AND DETERMINED TO DO HER UTMOST TO SECURE THE FRIENDSHIP OF ONE WHO LOOKED SO NOBLE AND SPOKE SO WELL
WELL THAT'S NICE HEARING WHEN I'M SPENDING MY MONEY ON YOU AND THINKING SUCH A LOT OF YOU AND REMEMBERING THE STRAIGHT HONORABLE SORT OF MAN YOUR FATHER WAS BUT DO YOU KNOWING MY FATHER AS YOU DID FEELING FOR HIM AS YOU STILL DO--DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS OF ME SAID LESLIE
HE WAS HOLDING THE BOX IN HIS HAND
ALL THAT DREADFUL PERIOD OF BONDAGE IN WHICH THE GIRL OF TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS KEPT HAS PASSED AWAY
A VERY LITTLE SILVER NO MORE
BELLE WITH A THEATRICAL GESTURE AND A FLINGING UP OF HER RIGHT HAND COMMENCED
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD I WILL TELL YOU ALL REPLIED RUPERT IN A CHEERFUL VOICE
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE STATE POOR AUNT HELEN IS IN I EARNESTLY WISH I COULD HELP SAID LESLIE
I HATED TO TELL HIM AND YET I FELT OBLIGED TO
WE ARE NONE OF US RICH
IT WAS A LOVELY DAY IN JULY AND THEY WERE GOING OFF FOR A PICNIC ON THE RIVER
AND I OH LESLIE I CAN'T BEAR IT MARJORIE TURNED AWAY WALKED TO THE WINDOW RESTED HER ELBOW ON THE SILL AND LOOKED OUT
MY POOR DEAR MISGUIDED CHILDREN A WOMAN'S TRUE AIM WHEN SHE REACHES MATURITY IS TO MARRY A GOOD HUSBAND AND TO HAVE A HAPPY HOME OF HER OWN BUT I NEVER INTEND TO MARRY SAID MARJORIE
YOU HAVE THE BACK WITH THE LITTLE SIDE WINDOW
LESLIE WENT ON PACKING HER BASKET
I DID NOT ASK THE MAN AT THE DOOR SHE SAID
YOU CANNOT TELL WHAT A THIRST LIKE MINE MEANS
HOW COULD I EVER DOUBT A GIRL WITH A FACE LIKE LESLIE'S HE STOOD UP AS HE SPOKE
AT ANY RATE I HAVE THAT WEEK TO TURN ROUND IN WE WILL GO TO THE BANK SAID LESLIE
YOU SURELY DON'T SUPPOSE THAT OUR EDUCATION IS FINISHED
THE SCREEN WHICH HID THE WASHING APPARATUS WAS A LIBERTY ONE AND VERY PRETTY
MRS CHETWYND WAS STANDING IN THE HALL TO WELCOME THEM
IT MUST BE THE SAME SHE SAID
LLEWELLYN TURNED ROUND AND A SMILE BROKE OVER HIS FACE
HE SAID THAT HE ONLY WISHED HE KEPT A PROVISION SHOP INSTEAD OF A DRAPERY SHOP SO THAT HE MIGHT SEND US PIES AND THINGS FOR OUR PICNIC BUT EVEN THOUGH HE DOES KEEP A LINEN-DRAPER'S SHOP SAID HESTER HE COULD STILL HELP US
THE GROUNDS WERE THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE IN LENGTH AND THE FOUR HALLS BUILT ROUND A QUADRANGLE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE
YOU ARE AN ANGEL AFTER ALL THE WORDS WERE SCARCELY OUT OF ANNIE'S LIPS HER HAND HOT AND TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED LESLIE'S SLEEVE BEFORE THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND BELLE ACHESON WAS ANNOUNCED
THE VERY TONE OF YOUR VOICE IS ALL STRAIN
BUT OF COURSE LESLIE I HAVE NO INTENTION OF FORCING YOUR CONFIDENCE DON'T LIKE A DARLING SAID LESLIE
IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO CALL
SHE FELT A SENSE OF BEING CRUSHED SHE FELT SURE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THING SHE MUST GO HALT AND MAIMED FOR THE REMAINDER OF HER DAYS
OH I AM OBLIGED OF COURSE OR I TRY TO BE OBLIGED
LET ME HAVE TEN SHILLINGS AT LEAST
OFF YOU GO AT ONCE
BUT I DON'T KNOW YET WHAT I DID
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO BLACKMAIL ANNIE ANY MORE I WILL TELL MR PARKER ALL ABOUT THIS MATTER
WHO WOULD WASTE A PRECIOUS HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN STUPID THINGS LIKE FROCKS WELL CHILDREN I SHALL GIVE YOU EACH A PROPER WARDROBE TO START WITH SAID MRS CHETWYND
AND AS TO VISITING DRESSES WE DO NOT INTEND TO VISIT IN THE ORDINARY SENSE
AND OUR BODIES ARE THEY NOT JUST CLOTHES FOR THE SOUL
I SEE QUITE WELL LESLIE THAT IT IS ALL USELESS
I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD WHEN I HAVE HAD MY SAY OUT TODAY
ESTHER HAS EVERYTHING IN PERFECT ORDER FOR YOU
BUT I AM IN A GREAT HURRY
I KNOW YOUR BEING ILL WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE LESLIE HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HER SENTENCE BEFORE ANNIE PUSHED HER AWAY
CAN YOU FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO THE CHETWYNDS CERTAINLY I CAN
SHE IS TRYING TO SCARE US WITH THOSE OLD BOGY WORDS AS IF WE MINDED
IS SHE BETTER SHE IS BELLE
FOR YOUR FATHER'S SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF OLD TIMES HE SAID
WHAT CAN BE UP
I WON'T SING IF YOU WOULD RATHER NOT ON THE CONTRARY DEAR
BUT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO TALK OVER THE VERY IMPORTANT MATTER WHICH HAS BROUGHT ME HERE TO-DAY
HE HAS BEEN IN AUSTRALIA FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS BUT HAS JUST RETURNED HOME
AND YOU ARE LEFT A WIDOW AND WITH THE CARE OF THAT BIG BOY ON YOUR SHOULDERS I WON'T BE ON MOTHER'S SHOULDERS ANY LONGER GRUMBLED LLEWELLYN
THERE IS NO USE IN OUR GETTING INTO FRESH TROUBLE ANNIE TURNED SLOWLY AWAY
I WONDER IF THEY WILL TELL US ANYTHING
WELL I CAN'T SHOW YOU AT PRESENT
THIS NOTE IS MY PROPERTY AND I REFUSE TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS FOR THE PRESENT MEANWHILE ANNIE WANDERED ABOUT THE STREETS UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR MR PARKER TO APPEAR AT HIS OFFICE
WHY WON'T LESLIE GILROY CONFESS THE TRUTH
COME HERE
LESLIE STARTED UP TO REMONSTRATE
HOW ARE YOU FOWLER
HAD SHE DONE SO SHE MUST HAVE BURST OUT WITH THE TRUTH
WELL ANNIE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU
BY HIS WILL WHEN YOU LEAVE SCHOOL AND REACH THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YOU ARE BOTH ENTITLED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR AND YOU ARE NOT TO BE COERCED IN THE WAY YOU SPEND THE MONEY HIP
ANNIE GOT IN
DO LET HER FINISH SAID EILEEN
THEY ARE IN HER ROOM NOW SAID MARJORIE
HER RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES DID NOT COME TO HER AID IN THIS CRISIS
ALL HER WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH GREAT ELOQUENCE AND MUCH FEELING
THE BRIGHT FLOOD OF MOONLIGHT WAS BROKEN BY A HUGE SHADOW
THE EXPERT'S LETTER HAD PLEASED HIM
SIT DOWN
SIT DOWN
THERE WAS ALSO AN EXTENSIVE LIBRARY STANDING A LITTLE BACK FROM THE HALLS OF RESIDENCE A GREAT GYMNASIUM AND ANOTHER BUILDING DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CLASS AND LECTURE ROOMS
AND FOR THE CENTRAL SYMBOL HE HAS TAKEN WHEAT AS BEING QUITE LITERALLY THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF AMERICAN POWER AND PROSPERITY
BUT OF WHAT NATURE LESLIE COULD NOT IN THE LEAST MAKE OUT
MY DEAR CHILD YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR PHOTOGRAPHY WHEN YOU ARE INTRODUCED TO HER MAJESTY AND ARE IN THE FULL SWING OF A SOCIETY CAREER BUT MOTHER I NEVER MEAN TO BE IN SUCH A TRULY AWFUL POSITION CRIED MARJORIE
IN THE ORDINARY SENSE IT IS NOT
WELL YOU SEE IT WAS THIS WAY SAID PARKER
WE WILL DROP THE SUBJECT OF FURNITURE
YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW NOW FOR CERTAIN THAT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO CUT THE OLD LIFE
SHE OPENED THE DOOR QUICKLY AND THEN SAW ANNIE WITH HER RED HAIR FLYING WILDLY ABOUT HER FACE AND SHOULDERS PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
AND DEAR,"--LESLIE'S VOICE SHOOK,--"I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO SAY IT AND YET I WILL--THERE IS ONE THING TO BE DONE SPEAK
I WANT YOU JUST TO EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT OF FAITH IN YOUR FATHER'S OLD FRIEND AND NOT TO SAY A SINGLE WORD TO YOUR MOTHER ABOUT THIS
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN LESLIE BEFORE AND RATHER RESENTED HER INTRUSION ON THE SCENE
IT IS TRUE SHE PULLED THE COUNTERPANE OVER HER IN CASE MRS ACHESON OR BELLE SHOULD COME INTO THE ROOM
SHE LOOKED WONDERFULLY HANDSOME AND MORE THAN ONE PERSON TURNED TO GAZE AT HER
I AM SO LONELY AND MISERABLE AND IT WOULD BE AN IMMENSE COMFORT TO SEE ANYONE
I AM A LONELY MAN MADAM
I WAS FEELING QUITE LOST AND STRANGE
I CANNOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME TO-DAY
FOR GOODNESS SAKE MARJORIE DON'T WORRY AUNT HELEN THE FIRST EVENING CRIED LETTIE.--"DEAR AUNT HELEN EVERYTHING WILL BE RIGHT--QUITE RIGHT
THE SECOND GONG PEALED THROUGH THE HOUSE AND ANNIE SUDDENLY STARTED TO HER FEET
DO BELLE SIT DOWN AND BE COMFORTABLE
YOU CAN HAVE THEM BACK WHEN YOU WANT THEM BUT RUPERT THEY ARE ALL I POSSESS ALL I HAVE BETWEEN ME AND THE WORKHOUSE BOTHER THE WORKHOUSE
THEY MUST KEEP WITH THE TIMES
NOW WHAT AM I TO DO SAID BELLE
MR PARKER I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING MY CHILDREN OF YOUR GREAT KINDNESS CONTINUED MRS GILROY
DO JUST CONSIDER THAT MY WINNING HONORS IN MATHEMATICS IS A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT YOUR DRAWERS SHOULD BE IN IMMACULATE ORDER
MEANWHILE MR PARKER GLANCED AROUND HIM
BLESS HER EART HE EXCLAIMED TO THE FOOTMAN SHE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S RATHER AWKWARD TO TALK ABOUT THE WIFE AND BAIRNS AT A PLACE LIKE KING'S CROSS
GIRLS SHE SAID DON'T SAY WHAT YOU ARE JUST ABOUT TO SAY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I COULD INJURE HER I KNOW YOU WILL INJURE HER IF YOU GO BACK
ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T YIELD SHE SAID
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING WHATEVER ABOUT MATHEMATICS SHE SAID
COME IN DO
PON MY WORD
PON MY WORD
IN HER QUIET SHELTERED PROSPEROUS LIFE WHAT CAN SHE KNOW OF SORROWS LIKE MINE
I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT PULSE
I ENJOYING TEA AT THIS HOUR IN BED AND DRINKING IT OUT OF SUCH DELICATE CHINA
COME WHAT SHALL I SHOW YOU
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A QUEER THING HAPPENED
HE HAD MANAGED ANNIE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW TO GET HIMSELF UP WELL
I'LL GO BACK AND SPEAK TO HER
POOR DEAR DARLING SHE'S THE SWEETEST MOTHER IN ALL THE WORLD
I CANNOT SEE THEM WAS THE REPLY
HAVE YOU HAD BAD NEWS SAID LESLIE
BUT IT MAY BE BEST FOR HER TO STAY HERE
IF I KNOW WHAT THE WHOLE THING MEANS
HAS ANYTHING GOOD HAPPENED
A WHOLE PARTY ARE COMING TO VISIT YOU IN YOUR ROOMS THIS EVENING
NOW SHE IS VERY ILL AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUS AND YET THE VERY WORST STAGE OF THE FEVER IS YET TO COME
I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE THIS MORNING AND HEARD YOU WERE OUT
YOU DID YOUR BEST AND YOU CAN DO NO MORE
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME HE SAID
EILEEN SCRAMBLED INTO THE CARRIAGE ALMOST HEADFOREMOST TREADING ON HER DRESS AND TEARING A PIECE OF BRAID AS SHE DID SO
WHAT IS TO HAPPEN TO ME IF I DARE TO GO TO THE BROAD WITH POOR LETTIE YOU MAKE MY SOUL SINK IN DESPAIR SAID BELLE
ON THAT POINT I AM FIRM
AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER ONE HAS A CHEST OF DRAWERS OR NOT WHETHER ONE HAS A SUITABLE WASHHAND-STAND OR NOT
THINK WHAT IT ALL MEANS LETTIE BEFORE YOU CONDEMN US SO SEVERELY
IT WAS PAPERED WITH A VERY ARTISTIC PAPER AND HAD A DEEP DADO WHICH JANE HERSELF HAD PAINTED WITH A RUNNING PATTERN OF WILD FLOWERS AND BIRDS
YOU SEE HOW STERNLY THE MEN DISAPPROVE OF THIS FEARFUL STEP ON THE PART OF MODERN WOMEN LETITIA SUPPRESSED A SHORT SIGH
I SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM OR THE HOUSE WHEN HE COMES TO SEE US
THERE ARE SEVERAL USEFUL PURCHASES THAT I MUST MAKE
AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU LESLIE THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL
THIS SOB WAS ECHOED BY LESLIE
THEY WALKED UP THE AISLE AND TURNED INTO ONE OF THE PEWS AND KNELT DOWN
I REGRET TO SAY THAT MISS LETTIE CHETWYND THE YOUNG PERSON WHO IS STEERING US IS OF DIFFERENT METAL
WHY HAD I NOT A SISTER LIKE YOU SHE SAID
HEAR HEAR SHE REPEATED CONTINUING RAPIDLY
YES I AM ALL RIGHT NOW
THEIR SERGE SKIRTS HAD BEEN MADE BY A WORK-GIRL AS NOTHING WOULD INDUCE THEM TO WASTE MONEY ON A DRESSMAKER
DO GO SAID MRS CHETWYND
THEY ARE NECESSARY
BUT A LIGHT-BLUE CAMBRIC SHIRT AND A WHITE SAILOR HAT WITH A BROAD WHITE RIBBON GAVE DISTINCTION TO HER COSTUME
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING I DID
I WILL COME ANOTHER DAY WHEN YOU FEEL MORE LIKE THE LESLIE GILROY WHOM I USED TO ADMIRE AT ST WODE'S I WILL NEVER BE THE LESLIE THAT YOU ADMIRED IF YOU WISH ME NOT TO GIVE SYMPATHY TO THOSE IN TROUBLE REPLIED LESLIE
YOU OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL I'M NOT--I CAN'T BE
DO YOU EVER EXPECT TO ENTERTAIN SIX PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WHERE YOU WORK
I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE SHE IS NOT MY OWN
I'LL TELL MOTHER WHEN WE GET TO RICHMOND THAT YOU WERE A BIT SEEDY
WHEN YOU ARE THERE I WILL TALK TO YOU AGAIN
SURELY THAT IS ENOUGH AND WHAT ABOUT EVENING DRESSES AND SUNDAY DRESSES AND VISITING DRESSES SAID MRS CHETWYND
OH I KNOW WHAT HE WILL SAY AND WHAT TORTURE I SHALL HAVE TO ENDURE
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME A RUSH OF REAL LONELINESS VISITED HER
AS THE POLES ARE WE ASUNDER
I FORETELL THAT I CAN TWIST MY FAIR BELLE ROUND MY LITTLE FINGER
I HAVE GOT INTO A SCRAPE WHICH I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU
MRS ACHESON COULD ONLY MANAGE PLAIN TEAS AT HOME AND SHE ENJOYED HER FRIEND'S MEALS SHE WAS FOND OF SAYING ALL THE MORE BY CONTRAST
SHE GOT INTO A SCRAPE WENT IN DEBT AND WANTED ME TO GIVE HER MONEY
DO LET US DROP PARKER OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION
IF MRS ACHESON ONLY KNEW THE TRUTH IF SHE COULD GUESS EVEN FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THAT BETWEEN ANNIE AND STARVATION WERE ONLY FOUR SHILLINGS WOULD SHE NOT IMMEDIATELY THINK THAT SHE ANNIE HAD COME INTO HER HOUSE ON FALSE PRETENSES
SHE KNOCKED
MRS ACHESON ASKED HIM TO TAKE HER DAUGHTER DOWN AND SHE HERSELF CONDUCTED ANNIE TO THE DINING-ROOM
THE GIRL LOOKED LOVELY WITH HER CLASSICAL FEATURES AND THE LONG STRAIGHT LASHES LYING UPON THE SOFT ROUNDED CHEEKS
HER AMBITION WAS TO CARRY OFF DOUBLE-FIRSTS AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD A FAIR CHANCE OF OBTAINING THIS BLUE RIBBON
WE WILL PUT SOME ON HER FOREHEAD
SHE SLEPT HEAVILY ALL NIGHT BUT TOWARD MORNING SHE BEGAN TO HAVE CONFUSED AND TROUBLED DREAMS WITH REGARD TO BELLE'S WOODEN BOX
YOU NEED NOT SAY ANY MORE SHE TURNED HER BACK ON LESLIE AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW
I CANNOT TOUCH YOUR MONEY
HERE ARE THE KEYS SAID MARJORIE
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU WILL BETRAY ME I AM NOT LIKELY TO BE ASKED SAID ANNIE
HE THOUGHT OF THE DREAMS WHICH MUST NEVER BE REALIZED OF THE SCHOOL-FELLOWS WHO WOULD MORE OR LESS DESPISE HIM OF THE DIFFERENT POSITION HE MUST OCCUPY IN FUTURE
IN ADDITION TO THE SIX ORDINARY CHAIRS THERE IS AN ARMCHAIR
IF MISS MERRIMAN'S ACCOUNT WAS TRUE SHE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT FOR HOURS
I ALWAYS LOVE SCENERY
WHEN THE HALL-DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM BOTH LADIES WERE ELOQUENT IN HIS PRAISE
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS I MAY BE EARNING A SALARY OF TWO HUNDRED A YEAR FOR I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU THAT YOUNG FORREST HAS TAKEN NO END OF A FANCY TO ME AND HE AND I HAD A LONG TALK TO-DAY
I'LL JUST RUN UPSTAIRS TO TIDY UP
IS NOT THAT A GOOD IDEA MOTHER CONTINUED KITTY LOOKING UP
BUT YOU MAY AS WELL SEND BACK A POLITE MESSAGE SAY WITH MY COMPLIMENTS THAT I SHALL BE HEARTILY PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION ANSWERED RUPERT
COFFEE WAS BROUGHT IN VERY FRAGRANT STRONG COFFEE
AND THAT I SHALL DERIVE BENEFIT FROM A CONVERSATION WITH HER CHAPTER XVIII THE GUILD OF ST
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I'D SEE HIM STANDING BY MY BEDSIDE
HE TALKED ABOUT INDIA SPOKE OF THE LINER IN WHICH HE WAS GOING OUT
I KNOW SHE WILL PLEAD FOR ME
A FLATTERER IS INDEED A FALSE FRIEND BUT I AM NOT FLATTERING YOU
AFTER ALL PERHAPS YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JANE
BUT YOU ARE A MERCIFUL GIRL
WHO WANTS TO LOLL IN AN ARMCHAIR
I OUGHT NOT TO MIND HER--I MEAN I OUGHT NOT TO BE REALLY HURT
DON'T SAY A WORD
OH PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH AT ONCE IT IS FOR YOU TO TELL ME REPLIED MR PARKER SOMEWHAT TARTLY
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD FLUNG OPEN A DOOR AND REVEALED A GOOD-SIZED ROOM WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER GIRL AT THE FARTHER END WHO WORE A SHOCK OF RED HAIR RATHER UNTIDILY PUT UP IN A LOOSE KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
THAT IS THE TRUTH
CAN'T YOU MANAGE WITH A CANDLE JUST FOR ONCE CERTAINLY SAID LESLIE
BELLE HERSELF WAS ALL EAGERNESS NOW
KITTY HERSELF WAS ALWAYS THE PINK OF NEATNESS
BUT I DON'T THINK I EVER WAS
MARJORIE STILL WEARING HER SHABBY SERGE DRESS WAS STANDING NEAR AN OPEN WINDOW
I HAVE COME TO SEE MR PARKER SAID LESLIE
HER CAREER IN LIFE WOULD BE PRACTICALLY RUINED
OH YES YOU DEAR OLD MAMMY YOU ARE--YOU CANNOT DENY IT
THEY WENT DOWN TO DINNER
TURN THE KEY IN THE LOCK PLEASE OH MARJORIE
WELL WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ORNAMENTAL ROOMS
YOU KNOW ON OCCASIONS YOU ARE ABSENT-MINDED AND ONE-HALF OF THIS ROOM IS MINE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
WE HAVE TOLD YOU THAT WE DO NOT INTEND TO BE PRESENTED TO HER MAJESTY WELL I HOPE TO GET YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MINDS YET
I AM DEEPLY INTERESTED IN YOUNG GIRLS AND ANY FRIEND OF MY BELLE'S HAS MY KINDEST SYMPATHY
IF I MAY VENTURE TO ASK SAID MRS CHETWYND FOLDING HER HANDS IN AN ATTITUDE OF DESPAIR
THERE WAS DISAPPROVAL IN HIS FACE
WELL THE OLD MAN HAS PAID UP
I WAS RESTLESS AND MISERABLE ABOUT YOU AND I WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR YOU
WELL HOW DID I GET ON HE INQUIRED
THEY THINK THAT THE WORST IS OVER
ALL THE PLEASURE HAD LEFT IT
BELLE STRETCHED OUT HER HAND
DON'T QUESTION ME NOW FOR I CANNOT BEAR IT SHE SAID
NOW HE LOOKED AS IF DESPAIR HAD SEIZED HIM
THE MORE I THINK THE MORE ASSURED I AM AND YOUR FACE TELLS ME SO PLAINLY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
HE IS A CLEVER WHICH IS BETTER THAN BEING A CHARMING MAN SAID BELLE
RUPERT IS ABOUT AS BAD A LOT AS I HAVE EVER MET
YOU ARE AT PRESENT UNDER THE AWFUL EYE OF BELLE ACHESON
BUT FOR TO-NIGHT IT DOES NOT MATTER OH I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO BE GOOD-NATURED
I WAS SO STARTLED TO FIND THAT SHE ALSO KNEW YOU
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO TO BED SHE SAID PRESENTLY
ANOTHER CLERK MOTIONED TO THE GIRLS TO SEAT THEMSELVES ON A BENCH NOT FAR FROM THE DOOR
I SUPPOSE IT IS THE WEIGHT OF ALL THE LEARNING THAT BOTHERS YOU
LETTIE WHY IS THAT FROWN BETWEEN YOUR BROWS I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS FROWNING ANSWERED LETITIA I WAS ONLY THINKING OF THE ORNAMENTAL PART OF LIFE AND HOW I COULD CARRY IT OUT MOST EFFECTIVELY LETITIA WAS DRESSED WITH SPECIAL CARE NOT UNSUITABLY FOR SHE HAD TOO GOOD TASTE FOR THAT
AND OH DO SEE ITS TINY TOES ANOTHER TALL GIRL BENT FORWARD AND BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE BABY'S FEET
DO YOU MIND AS YOU ARE LEAVING THE ROOM SHUTTING THAT WINDOW
MOTHER'S MONEY IS SAFE IN MY PURSE INSTEAD OF ON MY PERSON AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIRD AND FIRST CLASS MEANS A CONSIDERABLE ADDITION ALSO TO MY NICE HEAVY LITTLE PURSE
WE CAN SEND A MESSENGER PRESENTLY I MUST WRITE TO MY MOTHER WHO WILL SEND ME WHAT I REQUIRE REPLIED LESLIE
I AM DISAPPOINTED AND I MUST OWN IT NOW WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO ANNOY YOU SAID MARJORIE
THE MERE THOUGHT DRIVES ME HALF WILD
YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN WE MEET
I PROMISE NOT TO TELL WHAT ANNIE HAS DONE IF YOU MAKE ME A PROMISE NOT TO BLACKMAIL HER AGAIN BLACKMAIL
IF YOU WILL LEAVE US WE WILL ALL COME DOWN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HERE IS ESTHER TO WAIT ON YOU SAID MRS CHETWYND
BUT AFTER THAT YOU WILL BE LEFT IN PEACE
SHE THINKS SHE CAN BEAR TO BE AWAY FROM EILEEN IF I AM HERE THEN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DO GRANT HER REQUEST
I HAVE TO ATTEND TWO BIG FUNCTIONS AND MUST TAKE MY COPY AFTERWARDS TO THE GRAPHO AND THE DAILY POST LLEWELLYN FIDGETED
SEE HERE IS A TEN-SHILLING PIECE AND HERE ARE FOUR SHILLINGS
SHE IS THE MOST ECCENTRIC CREATURE I EVER MET
MOTHER DEAR I AM SICK OF TEACHING WHAT ROT CRIED LLEWELLYN
MAD IF THOU WILT OH MISS GILROY DO THINK OF THE FRIVOLITY OF THE GREATER NUMBER OF OUR SEX
DOES HEAT MATTER
WELL I SEE YOU ARE GOOD-NATURED AND I DON'T WANT TO BE DISAGREEABLE
IF IN GRASPING THE NEW WE LET GO OF THE OLD WE MAKE A VAST MISTAKE SHE CONTINUED HER EYES FLASHING WITH SUPPRESSED FIRE
THAT DOES SEEM STRANGE
PERHAPS THIS YOUNG LADY--I DID NOT CATCH HER NAME--OH MISS GILROY--PERHAPS MISS GILROY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WILL EXCUSE US YES AUNT HELEN I WILL GO UP SAID LETTIE
BUT I WILL NOT ORDER THE PRESENTATION DRESSES TO-DAY THAT'S A DEAR
ANNIE SHE SAID AGAIN
WELL WE ARE LANDED AT LAST SHE SAID CLASPING HER SISTER'S HAND
AND YOU DARE NOT ABUSE HIM
PERHAPS WE BOTH WERE EVEN DARLING EILEEN
WE ARE ALL EXPECTED TO BE IN BED SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO BE OUTSIDE THE GATES AFTER HALF-PAST TEN UNLESS SPECIAL LEAVE IS GIVEN
MR PARKER'S ATTITUDE TO HER YESTERDAY KEPT RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HER MEMORY
HE STOOD UP AND LOOKED AT HIS SISTER WITH AS EXPRESSIONLESS A FACE AS HE COULD POSSIBLY MANAGE TO ASSUME
I DON'T FEEL CROSS NOW ADDED THE GIRL
I CANNOT SYMPATHIZE WITH LETTIE EITHER SAID MARJORIE WHEN LETTIE HAD GONE
HE WAS IMPRESSED BY LESLIE'S MANNER AND BY HER REMARKABLE BEAUTY
OH YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE DREADFULLY PURITAN GOODY-GOODY PEOPLE SHE SAID WHO ALWAYS HATE AN UNFORTUNATE SINNER
SHE HERSELF SHALL GIVE IT TO ME
BUT I CAN ONLY SAY I WILL NEVER INCUR ANOTHER
MOTHER HAS ACCEPTED
LLEWELLYN I THINK YOU ARE THE BRAVEST BOY IN ALL THE WORLD YOU WOULD NOT SAY SO IF YOU HAD SEEN ME TWO HOURS BACK
IF THEY SUDDENLY WANT A LITTLE MONEY AND REMEMBER THAT THEIR FATHER'S OLD FRIEND CAN BE BEFOOLED BEING AN OLD MAN HIMSELF AND TENDER-HEARTED THEY YIELDED TO TEMPTATION
SOMETIMES SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND SOMETIMES LESLIE WHO HAD TAKEN UP A BOOK AND WAS TRYING TO READ FANCIED SHE SAW HER LIPS MOVING
THERE SHE SITS WITH NEEDLE AND THREAD REPAIRING MY GARMENTS AND I--I PERMIT IT I THINK SHE IS AWFULLY KIND TO YOU SAID LESLIE
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT WE WERE EXACTLY IN THE SAME SET FOR GILROY BELONGED TO GENTLEFOLKS WHEREAS I--WELL MY FATHER KEPT A GROCER'S SHOP
WE WILL SAY NO MORE AT PRESENT
MISS LAUDERDALE IS SORRY THAT THE NOTICE IS SO BRIEF
CHAPTER V THE MODERN VIEW OF LIFE
BUT NOW I MUST SPEAK ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
BUT YOU DID NOT PUT THE MATTER INTO MY HANDS YOUR OLD FRIEND
BUT THESE DELIGHTFUL ROOMS AND YOU DEAR AUNT HELEN OUGHT TO CURE THEM IN NO TIME.--NOW GIRLS DO GET OFF THOSE HORRID DRESSES AND GET INTO RESPECTABLE ONES.--THEY HAVE RESPECTABLE DRESSES I ASSURE YOU AUNT HELEN
I WANT BEYOND EVERYTHING ELSE ON EARTH TO SLEEP SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN ON HER BED WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT AT UNDRESSING
HER VOICE HAD SUNK TO THE LOWEST WHISPER
I COULD NEVER GUESS THAT A SCHOOL SO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS MISS MARCHLAND'S WAS WOULD SEND BACK GIRLS IN THE CONDITION MARJORIE AND EILEEN ARE IN
SIT DOWN PLEASE MR PARKER SAID MRS GILROY LESLIE I THINK OUR FRIEND WOULD LIKE A GLASS OF WINE
I WANT TO HELP MY MOTHER
THE OTHERS ENGAGED IN THEIR OWN CHATTER TOOK NO SPECIAL NOTICE
WHAT IS YOUR GRIEF COMPARED TO HIS MISERY
HE COULD NOT HELP SMILING INTO THE BEAMING DARK EYES AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING NOTWITHSTANDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHAGRIN HOW NICE IT WAS TO HAVE MISS MARJORIE BACK FROM SCHOOL
BUT BELLE SHALL NOT COME WITH ME
NOW IT RESTS WITH YOURSELF
DO LET ME FINISH
THEY WALKED SLOWLY DOWN THE TOWING-PATH
IN THE FIRST PLACE PROFESSORSHIPS DO NOT MEAN WEALTH AND FOR MOTHER'S SAKE I MEAN TO BE A WEALTHY MAN SOME DAY
OH WE HAVE HAD SUCH A JOLLY TIME INTERRUPTED FLORRIE
IF HE DOES NOT GET THAT SIXTY POUNDS TO-NIGHT HE WILL BE DESPERATE
IF YOU LIKE OUR SOCIETY YOU CAN HAVE IT
NOW REMEMBER LETTIE I TRUST YOU
HOW SHE WISHED SHE HAD BEEN EQUALLY DETERMINED
THERE WERE TWO DOCTORS HERE THIS MORNING AND THERE ARE TWO NURSES A DAY AND A NIGHT NURSE ON DUTY
I KNOW THE OLD SCHOOLROOM
CHAPTER XIX--THE MAN BY THE RUIN
THE TEARS STARTED TO HER EYES AS SHE SPOKE
I HAD A HOPE IT IS TRUE WHEN I SAW YOU IN LONDON
THAT IS TRULY SAD SAID THE GOOD LADY
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN A BIT LIKE YOURSELF FOR THE LAST HOUR OR TWO LESLIE MADE NO REPLY
I MAY SOME DAY GO TO THE UNIVERSITY
THE GIRLS ARE MODERN AND NOTHING WILL MAKE THEM ANYTHING ELSE SHE SAID
PUT ON YOUR THICKEST COAT AND YOUR HEAVIEST HAT AND THEN YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY YOURSELF
HE WILL TAKE HIS PASSAGE FOR AUSTRALIA TO-MORROW
AS SOON AS EVER I SAW HIM I REMEMBERED THAT YOUR DEAR FATHER HAD CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF HIM
WHAT BELLE MEANS BY THE IONIAN AND NON-IONIAN DIALECTS I AM ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT ABOUT IT DOES NOT MATTER SAID ANNIE GENTLY
I WAS TERRIBLY POOR FOR THE LITTLE MONEY THAT I HAD SAVED I HAD ALREADY GIVEN TO MY BROTHER
ONE CAN TAKE AN INTEREST IN ANYTHING ONE SETS ONE'S MIND TO HE CONTINUED
IN LESS THAN A WEEK'S TIME THE FOUR FRESHERS WERE COMPLETELY SETTLED INTO THE LIFE AT ST WODE'S
REALLY EILEEN YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE WOMEN OF YOUR DAY IF YOU KEEP UP YOUR PRESENT FADS
SURELY YOU ARE NOT REGRETTING
SHE BROUGHT ME A NOTE FROM YOU
BUT AT ST WODE'S SUCH DANGEROUS ADJUNCTS TO THE PUBLIC PEACE ARE GENERALLY ROOTED OUT
LIVE IT DOWN WAS THE REPLY OF HER HEART
I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY OF YOUR DEAR EXTRAORDINARY CLEVER BELLE'S THEORIES AT PRESENT
BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW HER TO ORDER OUR LIVES CERTAINLY NOT SAID EILEEN WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR LIVES INTO OUR OWN HANDS AND WE WISH TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT THE MATTER BELLE
HERE"--HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET--"WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER TWENTY POUNDS FOR I HAVE GOT SOME BANK-NOTES
BUT THE WIFE ISN'T AS STRONG AS SHE OUGHT TO BE FOWLER COLORED ALL OVER HIS FACE AS HE SPOKE
THE GIRL WHO HAS COME TO SHARE YOUR ROOM AND YOU HAVE PUT ALL YOUR THINGS AWAY AND MADE NO NOISE
OF COURSE IT'S SAFE ANSWERED BELLE
THE COUNTERPANE IS COLORED
I CAN'T STAND IT GOD WILL GIVE YOU STRENGTH DEAR SAID LESLIE ALOUD
YOU WILL NOT INSIST TOO UPON MY SPENDING MONEY--MONEY THAT PRECIOUS GIFT--ON DRESS
THERE BIG HANDSOME OVERGROWN BOY THAT HE WAS HE SHED SOME TEARS
PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF WHEELS MUFFLED AS THEY DROVE OVER THE STRAW WAS DISTINCTLY HEARD AND THEN TWO DOCTORS BROUGHAMS DREW UP AT THE DOOR
I WILL TELL HIM
APPROACHING HER SOFTLY SHE TOOK HER HAND
HE WAS STARING AT LESLIE
I WAS BUSILY ENGAGED PREPARING COPY FOR TO-MORROW'S ISSUE WHEN A GENTLEMAN AN OLD FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S A CERTAIN MR PARKER CAME IN MR PARKER
I SHALL LEAVE WINGFIELD AT THE END OF TERM BUT WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING WHY SAID ANNIE WHY SHE WENT OVER AND STOOD BY THE WINDOW
THEY SCALDED RIGHT DOWN INTO HIS HEART
I DRAGGED YOU LOW ENOUGH WHEN I GAVE YOU THAT LAST MONEY
THE FAMILIAR WORDS QUIETED HER OVEREXCITED HEART
MY DEAR CHILD SHE SAID DO YOU KNOW THAT YOUR APPEARANCE QUITE CONCERNS ME
I SHALL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
AND NOW DR ERICSON WANTS TO CALL IN A THIRD
BUT THAT A FEW HOURS OF REST WILL PUT YOU RIGHT HE HURRIED OFF AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER LESLIE FROM HER WINDOW SAW THE CARRIAGE PARTY GET UNDER WAY
HER BROWN-STUDIES ARE TOO WONDERFUL
I ROSE VERY EARLY GOT HOLD OF SOME OF LESLIE'S HANDWRITING COPIED IT CAREFULLY WROTE THE LETTER WHICH I BROUGHT TO YOU GOT PERMISSION TO GO TO LONDON FROM MISS LAUDERDALE AND SAW YOU THAT AFTERNOON
IF YOU WISH TO TIDY JUST ROUND MY TABLE YOU MAY
SHE FOUND HERSELF BLUSHING AND HER HEART BEAT A TRIFLE QUICKER THAN ITS WONT
MR PARKER NOTICED HER EMOTION AND WAS NOT ILL PLEASED WITH IT
THEN A ROLL-CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS
YOU'LL JUST THINK IT OVER AND LET ME KNOW WHEN NEXT WE MEET
I'LL COME AND SEE YOU
YOU ARE A UNIVERSAL FAVORITE
I WANT TO BE ALONE--GO I KNOW YOU DON'T QUITE MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SAID LESLIE
PRAY INTRODUCE ME JANIE JANE PERFORMED HER DUTIES IN A SOMEWHAT PERFUNCTORY MANNER
DO HELP ME PLEASE
LETTIE WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW EILEEN GETS ON I WILL CALL AGAIN TO-MORROW MORNING TO INQUIRE IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID LESLIE
WE WOMEN OF THE LAST GENERATION HAD NOT THE ADVANTAGES WHICH YOU YOUNG CREATURES NOW RECEIVE
WERE YOU NOT RELIGIOUS BEFORE SHE ASKED
HIS MANNER HAD CHANGED
AS TO YOUR SISTER MISS CHETWYND OH WHAT ABOUT HER CRIED MARJORIE
AND NOW I WANT SOME WORK TO DO OF COURSE HOW COLD YOU LOOK LESLIE
I SEEM TO HAVE LOST ALL POWER OF SOOTHING OR HELPING EITHER OF THE GIRLS
WE CAN BECOME THE VERY CLOSEST FRIENDS
IF I DO REMAIN THEREFORE I SHALL BE PLAGUED WITH SOME TERRIBLE STUDENT OF THE FLORRIE SMART OR JANE HERIOT STYLE
I'LL WASH MY FACE AND HANDS AND MAKE MY HAIR TIDY AND GO BACK TO HER AGAIN
I WISH YOU WOULD SAID MARJORIE
BUT THAT RUPERT SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MRS ACHESON'S HOSPITALITY WAS MORE THAN THE POOR GIRL COULD STAND
HAVING RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS AT A HEADLONG SPEED SHE NOW PRESENTED HERSELF IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
AS IT IS I SHALL IN ALL PROBABILITY BE LOCKED OUT OF THE COLLEGE YOU ARE ALWAYS THINKING OF YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN MISERABLE SAFETY REPLIED THE MAN
IT IS ALL TOO TRUE
I WISH LETITIA WOULD SIT SO THAT I NEED NOT SEE THAT FASHIONABLE ARRANGEMENT OF HER HAIR--IT IRRITATES ME TERRIBLY
SHE MAY BE SYMPATHETIC WITHOUT BEING SENTIMENTAL
WHEN HER HUSBAND DIED A MONTH BEFORE LITTLE DAN'S BIRTH THE MOTHER MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SKIMP THE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION NOT TO STARVE THEM ON A MERE PITTANCE BUT TO ADD TO HER INCOME BY HER OWN EXERTIONS
WE KNOW A VERY EARNEST STUDENT WHO BELONGS TO THIS COLLEGE AND SHE HAS GIVEN US QUITE DIFFERENT PARTICULARS WITH REGARD TO THE LIFE
AND LESLIE SAYING SHE WOULD SEE THE GENTLEMAN IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNDER SOME DREADFUL PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE
I HAVE ACCEPTED FOR YOU
HAVE YOU NO RELATIONS DEAR EXCEPT THAT EXTREMELY NICE-LOOKING BROTHER OF YOURS I HAVE NO RELATIONS AT ALL REPLIED ANNIE EXCEPT RUPERT
I HAD HOPED A GREAT DEAL BEFORE YOU ARRIVED
BUT ALL THE SAME I HAVE COME ON THAT VERY BUSINESS
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TAKE ME WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THE TRAIN WAS NOT AN EXPRESS
MR PARKER AND LESLIE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RIVER
AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BUY PRETTY THINGS FOR YOUR ROOMS NO AT LEAST LET ME RECOMMEND YOU TO PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH A TEA-SERVICE EACH
SHE DID NOT EVEN NOTICE ANNIE COLCHESTER WHO STOOD NEAR THE WINDOW
I MEAN TO BE THAT SECRETARY
BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING QUEER ABOUT YOU SOMETHING EARNEST AND OUT OF THE COMMON
THE MEAL CAME TO AN END AND WHEN THE LADIES ROSE RUPERT ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
POOR CHILD SHE FEELS THIS TERRIBLY
BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MR PARKER'S APPEARING AT WINGFIELD HAD EVIDENTLY NEVER ENTERED HER BRAIN
I HEARD THAT YOU WANTED A SECRETARY AND I BEGGED AND IMPLORED OF HER TO ASK YOU TO GIVE ME THE POST
I AM STATING FACTS
SHE SAT DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO FACE THE POSITION
SUPPOSE SHE HAD GONE OUT
OH LLEWELLYN WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM YET OH YOU ARE IN GREAT LUCK IF YOU GET INTO THE MATCHESON SET SAID JANE WITH A SLIGHT LOOK OF ENVY FLITTING ACROSS HER FACE
I GIVE UP THE HOPE WHICH SEEMED SO BRIGHT A SHORT TIME AGO
SHE ENTERED THE ROOM BRISKLY GREETED LESLIE WITH A HARD AND YET EXCITED LAUGH AND TOSSING OFF HER HAT SEATED HERSELF ON THE SIDE OF HER SOFA-BED
BUT HE IS SPECIALLY ENGAGED IS HE LIKELY TO BE DISENGAGED SOON ASKED LESLIE
SHE WAS VERY SAD LAST NIGHT POOR CHILD
AND IF YOU ARE GOOD-NATURED I WILL STICK UP FOR YOU OF COURSE
BY THE WAY SHE SAID
MY MOTHER HAS TO WORK VERY HARD TO SUPPORT US
MRS CHETWYND FELT QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEIR FATHER WAS TO BLAME FOR MARJORIE'S AND EILEEN'S PECULIAR APPEARANCE
OF COURSE I WAS OBLIGED TO STAY IN INDIA DURING YOUR FATHER'S LIFETIME WHICH PREVENTED MY HAVING AS MUCH INFLUENCE OVER YOU AS I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE OBTAINED
A MAN WAS STANDING IN THE DEEPEST SHADOW
I DON'T CHOOSE TO BE BEHOLDEN TO ANYBODY NOT EVEN TO MR PARKER WHO WAS MY FATHER'S FRIEND
I'M NOT SUCH A FOOL
THE OCTOPUS
SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THEM OF COURSE
AND I THOUGHT MYSELF SAFE SHE CONTINUED
IF HE KNEW EVEN FOR ONE MOMENT HOW ANNIE HAD GOT THAT MONEY IF HE KNEW ABOUT THE FORGED LETTER WOULD HE GIVE HER THE POST
GIVE ME THE KEY OF THE DOOR THIS MINUTE
WHO WAS HE
SHE EXPLAINED TO THE GIRLS THAT GOD HELD EACH OF THEM WITH THEIR VAST OPPORTUNITIES THEIR GREAT MEANS OF CULTURE THEIR ABUNDANCE OF MONEY FOR MOST OF THEM WERE WEALTHY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS
I'LL LOOK AFTER HER WHILE YOU ARE AWAY
AND I WOULD NOT IF I COULD HELP YOU IN THAT DREADFUL WAY AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT THINK OUT ANOTHER DODGE
MISS COLCHESTER PUT UP HER HAND TO RUFFLE HER RED LOCKS
WELL LETTIE YOU AT LEAST WILL REMAIN WITH ME SAID MRS CHETWYND
SHE WOULD GET INTO A WORSE SCRAPE IN ALL PROBABILITY BE RUSTICATED IF THIS LATTER OFFENSE WERE KNOWN
HER CAREER WOULD BE PRACTICALLY OVER
BUT IT WAS PAINFUL TO OBSERVE THEIR GREASY SERGE DRESSES AND THEIR HAIR CROPPED LIKE BOYS
EILEEN AND I HAVE ROWED A GOOD DEAL ON THE SEA SINCE WE WERE QUITE CHILDREN CAN YOU SWIM MISS GILROY ASKED JANE
IT LAY TOO DEEP
AFTER ALL SHE CONTINUED THERE IS NO GOOD IN FORCING MARJORIE AND EILEEN INTO GROOVES WHICH WERE NEVER MEANT FOR THEM
CHAPTER I PREPARING FOR THE YOUNG DEBUTANTES
LLEWELLYN GOING TO A BOOKCASE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM BEGAN TO FUMBLE WITH SOME BOOKS
MARJORIE SIGHED IN HER SLEEP AND MRS CHETWYND BENT OVER HER
BUT YOU MUST TELL ME ALL YOUR STORY LATER ON
THE KEY WAS THEN TURNED IN THE LOCK AND ANNIE SLIPPED IT INTO HER POCKET
AND IF SHE DOES THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST EDUCATION THAT CAN BE PROCURED WELL MA'AM IF THAT'S YOUR WHIM IT'S MINE ALSO SAID MR PARKER
POOR AUNT HELEN IS IN A PERFECTLY TERRIBLE STATE ABOUT HER
NOW MY DEAR GIRL WHAT IS THIS SAID DR HOWARD
YOU WILL TAKE HONORS OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW REPLIED LESLIE
SHE MAY THINK IT RUDE RUDE CRIED JANE WITH A LAUGH
THOUGHT THAT THE BED WITH THE BROKEN SPRING WAS ANYTHING BUT COMFORTABLE BUT THEN REFLECTED THAT SHE WAS TOO TIRED TO CARE
I DID NOT KNOW THAT RUPERT WAS GOING TO INDIA SHE SAID AT LAST RAISING THEM DESPERATELY AND FIXING THEM ON MRS ACHESON
DON'T WORRY THE MAMMY ANY MORE NOW SAID EILEEN
I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR HIS PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF GIRLS
THE REST OF THE MONEY WILL BUY THE FURNITURE
BELLE WE WILL VISIT YOU ANOTHER DAY
IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME WITH EILEEN I FEEL CONVINCED OH MY DEAR CHILD IF I COULD BUT BELIEVE IT
THE CHILDREN TAKE THE UPPER HAND AND--KEEP IT
WHEN MARJORIE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
30
30
A VAST DEAL FOR IT SHOWS THE REAL INCLINATION OF THE SOUL
GIVE HIM ONE LAST CHANCE MR PARKER
BUT SLEEP WAS FAR FROM HER WAKEFUL EYES
BELLE'S HOUSE WAS NO
OH I SHALL DO VERY WELL REPLIED LESLIE
A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM TO MYSELF SHE CONTINUED
IF YOU DON'T I SHALL TAKE IT BY FORCE RUPERT I HEAR SOMEONE STIRRING OVERHEAD
JUST THEN THERE CAME A TAP AT THE DOOR AND TWO GIRLS NAMED ALICE AND FLORRIE SMART PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
THAT CHAIR IS FOR A FRIEND IF A FRIEND HAPPENS TO COME IN
BUT I WILL KEEP MY VERSES UNTIL THEY ARE QUITE FINISHED EACH STANZA CORRECT THE SWING THE METER PERFECT
BUT EACH WITH STRENGTH AND COURAGE HAS LEARNED TO TAKE HER PART BRAVELY IN LIFE'S BATTLE
BUT IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH MINE HAVE YOU A CLOTHES BRUSH DEAR
IF ALL GOES WELL I MEAN TO HAVE MY THREE GIRLS PRESENTED THIS SEASON
SHE HAD BEEN STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
WHEN THEY CAUGHT LESLIE'S EYES THEY NODDED TO HER IN A PLEASANT HAIL-FELLOW-WELL-MET MANNER
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN I REALLY DO THINK SO
I'LL GO BACK TO HER AND I'LL STAY SO QUIET THAT EVEN THE NURSES WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
SHE HEARD WHAT MISS PENROSE SAID REMARKED EILEEN
I SHALL BE RUINED IF I DON'T GET IT BUT WON'T YOU CONSIDER ME AT ALL
THERE WERE SEVERAL WOMEN'S COLLEGES AT WINGFIELD BUT THE LARGEST AND THE BEST KNOWN AND THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS ST WODE'S
WILL YOU COME WITH US
IT IS TOO DISGRACEFUL MY GLOVES SUIT MY CHARACTER REPLIED MARJORIE
THERE WAS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE
IT IS A GREAT THING FOR A GIRL TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH OF THAT
SHE TOSSED HER HAT ON THE NEAREST CHAIR
I EXPECT LETTIE WILL DO VERY MUCH WHAT WE DO
LESLIE APPROACHED HER AND TOUCHED HER HAND
ONE MOMENT PLEASE INTERRUPTED PARKER
I AM NOT SPEAKING
THAT I CANNOT SAY
THERE WAS A SORT OF STUNNED FEELING OVER HER
THERE IS AN UGLY PUNISHMENT ACCORDED BY THE LAW TO SUCH PROCEEDINGS YOU CANNOT FRIGHTEN ME RUPERT SAID ANNIE MUCH TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THAT GENTLEMAN FOR I HAVE THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING CAREFULLY OVER
BUT HERE GOES.--BY THE WAY HAVE EITHER OF YOU TWO"--AS SHE SPOKE SHE TURNED TO EILEEN AND MARJORIE--"HAVE EITHER OF YOU TWO EVER BEEN TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE WINGFIELD NEVER SAID EILEEN
WOULD YOU TWO GIRLS HERE SHE GLANCED AT MARJORIE AND EILEEN PURPOSELY AVOIDING BOTH LESLIE AND LETTIE WOULD YOU TWO LIKE ME TO RECITE ALOUD THE POEM IN QUESTION OH FOR GOODNESS SAKE NO CRIED LETTIE
AND FINALLY SECURING A BERTH FOR HIM ON BOARD A VESSEL WHICH WAS BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA SAW HIM OFF HIMSELF ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
THEN LISTEN--HEARTLESS GIRL
SHE IS ON THE STAFF OF THE DAILY POST YOU ASTOUND ME
THAT TERRIBLE GIRL HAS INOCULATED YOU WITH HER DEMOCRATIC VIEWS
THEY WILL BE OLD MAIDS TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER
I FEEL QUITE FRIGHTENED
I NEVER COULD GET AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT STIFF RENDERING BEFORE
I AM A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT HER OH I WOULDN'T FRET IF I WERE YOU SAID SUSAN
BEFORE HE COULD STOOP TO PICK IT UP ANNIE HAD SNATCHED AT IT FLOWN ACROSS THE ROOM AND PUT IT OUT INTO THE HALL
WHEN SHE HAD DONE SO MARJORIE SAT UP PUSHED THE HAIR FROM HER FOREHEAD AND LOOKED AT LESLIE FROM BETWEEN HER SWOLLEN EYELIDS
DID YOU NOT OBSERVE WHEN THE ROLL WAS GONE THROUGH THAT HER NAME WAS MISSING I DID NOT NOTICE IT ANSWERED SUSAN
NOW LETTIE FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T BE SILLY
I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU THE INTENSE THE PASSIONATE PLEASURE I FEEL WHEN I AM ENGAGED OVER HARD MENTAL WORK
LESLIE YOU ARE A VERY GOOD GIRL AND I AM SORRY I WAS RUDE TO YOU TO-DAY IT DOES NOT MATTER ABOUT THAT IN THE LEAST REPLIED LESLIE
BUT IT IS SO SIMPLE
FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE TELL NO END OF FIBS--LIES I CALL THEM
YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW
ANNIE FELT THAT SHE HERSELF WAS A GUEST IN THAT HOUSE MORE OR LESS ON FALSE PRETENSES
HOW SERIOUSLY YOU SPEAK YES I AM QUITE CERTAIN
WE WILL TALK OF ALL THOSE THINGS TO-MORROW WHAT A TERRIBLE DAY TO-MORROW PROMISES TO BE SAID MARJORIE GLANCING TOWARDS EILEEN
BUT DO NOT LET US WASTE THESE PRECIOUS MOMENTS TALKING OF HER
THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS INDEBTED FOR SO MUCH BELIEVED HER GUILTY
NOW THAT I LOOK AT YOU MORE CLOSELY I OBSERVE IN YOUR EYES A REALLY SERIOUS LIGHT
JUST AT THAT MOMENT LESLIE POKED IN HER HEAD
SHE HAS DISAPPEARED AND WHY WHAT IS IT
THE MONEY IS TO BE PAID DIRECT TO ME AS REQUIRED AND HE HAS NOW GIVEN ME A CHECK FOR FIFTY POUNDS TO BUY THE NECESSARY OUTFIT WHICH YOU WILL REQUIRE FOR YOUR NEW LIFE
THEY WILL BE FOILS TO LETITIA WHO IS AS FAIR AS THEY ARE DARK
DEAR BELLE DO FINISH YOUR SENTENCE SHE SAID
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
SHE NOW SAW THAT ANNIE WAS RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN HER PART OF THE ROOM
MISS COLCHESTER I SEE YOU HAVE ARRIVED SAID MISS PAYNE THE HOUSEKEEPER
SHE THEN BEGAN TO UNFASTEN HER DRESS AND TAKING DOWN HER UNTIDY RED HAIR TWISTED IT UP INTO A KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
LETTIE WILL HAVE AWFUL TALES TO TELL OF HER
MARJORIE AND EILEEN IN SOILED AND MUCH BEDRAGGLED SCHOOL-PARTY FROCKS WENT DOWN TO DINNER
I CAME DOWN TO WINGFIELD THE NEXT DAY
NOW SEE YOU DO IT AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE CAN GIVE YOU MUCH OF HER TIME FOR SHE IS TO OPEN THE DEBATE
WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM TO COME HOME WITH US
BUT NEVER MIND
IT IS VERY WRONG INDEED OF YOU TO BE UP SO LATE
BUT I KNOW YOU ARE HATING IT SAID POOR ANNIE
LESLIE NOW KNELT DOWN AND GAZED INTO THE FACE OF THE SLEEPER
IN HER IMMENSE EFFORT FOR SELF-CONTROL FOR REPRESSION OF HER FEELINGS SHE EVEN THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT
BELLE SNATCHED HER HAND AWAY
WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THEM LESLIE LOOKED AT HER MOTHER
SURELY THE MORE WHO PRAY TO GOD THE BETTER I WILL CERTAINLY COME REPLIED BELLE QUIETLY
THEN SHE ROSE TO HER FEET
I AM PROUD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MR PARKER'S VOICE HAD BEEN ROUGH ENOUGH WHILE HE WAS ADDRESSING LLEWELLYN
OH WHAT A DARLING LITTLE BED--AND A SPRING-MATTRESS AND ALL
HE WANTS A GIRL TO COME TO HIS OFFICE EVERY DAY TO WRITE HIS LETTERS AND TO ATTEND GENERALLY TO HIS CORRESPONDENCE AND I INTEND TO SECURE THAT POST
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF HE CAN SEE YOU LESLIE TOOK UP THE CARD AND READ THE NAME
WHAT I HAVE SECURED IN PLACE OF FLOWERS IN PLACE OF COCOA-PARTIES IN PLACE OF LUXURIOUS FURNITURE IN PLACE OF THE FAL-LALS AND PRETTINESSES WHICH TAKE THE TONE OUT OF LIFE
OH I MUST DO SOMETHING SAID LETTIE
THE DOCTOR IS COMING ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
HE MUST BE SEEN OFF FOR ANNIE IS NOT TO BE PERSECUTED BY HIM ANY LONGER
I AM NOT GOING TO CONFIDE IN YOU
SUN SAYS
SHE RAN UP TO HER MOTHER AND KISSED HER
BUT IT'S ONLY LESLIE
IF THERE IS A MAN IN THE WORLD WHOM I FAIRLY LOATHE IT IS PARKER
EILEEN WHO REALLY HAD A TASTE FOR MUSIC WILL NOT CULTIVATE IT BECAUSE FORSOOTH SHE IS NOT A GENIUS
BUT I SHOULD LIKE A GLASS OF WATER PLEASE FOR MY THROAT IS QUITE DRY WITH ALL THE TALKING I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO GO THROUGH
LESLIE DEAR WOULD YOU FEEL INCLINED TO HEAR ME RECITE SOME VERSES OF MY OWN THIS MORNING
AND THAT LETTER--THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THAT LETTER

I WANT SO MUCH TO HEAR ABOUT YOURSELF--YOUR AMBITIONS YOUR HOPES YOUR DESIRES
YOU SAW US AND YOU YES I SAW YOU
MARJORIE COULD NOT HELP STARTING AS SHE HEARD BELLE ACHESON'S WELL-KNOWN VOICE
BUT THERE TIME PRESSES AND I MUST GO BACK BY THE FIVE-O'CLOCK TRAIN WELL I WILL JUST GET MY HAT
IF YOU AND MARJORIE FOR INSTANCE HAD BEEN MY DAUGHTERS AND EILEEN HAD BEEN YOU THEN THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASANT FOR YOU WOULD HAVE INFLUENCED MARJORIE AND BROUGHT HER BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIGHT WAYS

YOU FRIGHTEN ME DREADFULLY WHAT A LITTLE GOOSE YOU ARE
GO ON PLEASE BELLE
DID YOU SAY PARKER SHE ROUSED HERSELF AND LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT LESLIE
I AM HEARTILY GLAD YOU LIKE HER SAID EILEEN
IT IS NOT TO OPEN A HOSTEL FOR IDIOTIC WOMEN WHO THINK THEMSELVES LEARNED BUT TO HELP RUPERT COLCHESTER IN HIS HOUR OF NEED
LESLIE GOD DID HEAR OUR PRAYERS
SHE STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE QUAY THE MAN STANDING NEAR HER
SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER SHAKING HANDS
I CANNOT ADD ANOTHER WORD
MY DEAR LETTIE IS THAT YOU
30 NEWBOLT SQUARE
YOU ARE A VERY PLUCKY GIRL HE REPEATED
BUT REMEMBER I AM GOING TO CHARGE FOR IT
I AM IN THE HUMOR TO DO A GOOD DEED AND YOU ARE THE PERSON WHO WANTS IT DONE TO
BUT IT IS A FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE DO
BY THE WAY MISS GILROY YOU DID NOT TELL US WHICH HALL YOU WERE GOING TO I BELIEVE I AM TO SHARE A ROOM WITH ANOTHER STUDENT AT NORTH HALL SHE ANSWERED
YOU WILL KNOW ALL SOONER OR LATER WITH THE LETTERS IN HIS POCKET MR PARKER WENT STRAIGHT OFF TO SCOTLAND YARD
SHE ARRIVED AT THE RENDEZVOUS A MINUTE OR TWO LATE AND HE WAS ALREADY WAITING FOR HER
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT WOULD BE QUITE THE WORST OF ALL PRESENTLY BELLE APPEARED AND THE GIRLS SET OFF FOR THE MUSEUM
YOU DID WRONG IN SPENDING THAT MONEY BEFORE YOU GOT IT
AND MANAGED TO DELIGHT BOTH MRS ACHESON AND BELLE BY THE PEEP HE GAVE THEM INTO A WORLD WHICH THEY HAD NEVER ENTERED
YOU OUGHT TO BE KIND TO HER MARJORIE OH DON'T BEGIN TO LECTURE ME
BUT NO MATTER YOU ARE UNWORTHY TO HEAR THAT NAME
I CANNOT BEAR YOU TO TOUCH ME JUST NOW YOU CANNOT BEAR ME TO TOUCH YOU
YOU ARE ILL SAID LESLIE
IT IS IN A FASHIONABLE LOCALITY AND CLOSE TO EVERYTHING
MRS GILROY SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA
IF ANNIE DID NOT SOON RETURN THE LITTLE SIDE-DOOR WOULD BE LOCKED AND IT WOULD THEN BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BACK TO THE COLLEGE FOR THE NIGHT
WHAT A WASTED AFTERNOON BUT CAN'T YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY EVEN WITHOUT SEEING US VERY PLAINLY SAID EILEEN
THERE WAS A PORTER STANDING NEAR LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION
I NEVER KNEW THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE CONFIDENCES TO YOU
IF I HAD AS PRETTY A FACE AS YOURS I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND HOW I DRESSED
IT CAN NEVER MEAN THE SAME TO YOU SHE SAID AT LAST IN A SOLEMN VOICE AND THEN SHE LOOKED DOWN AGAIN AT HER BOOK PUSHED HER HANDS THROUGH HER RED LOCKS AND RESUMED HER CONTEMPLATION OF THE PROBLEM WHICH LAY BEFORE HER
THE TWO GIRLS SAT WITH THEIR HANDS LYING IDLY IN THEIR LAPS AND GAZED AT THEIR COUSIN
I MAY NOT BE IN UNTIL HALF-PAST TEN OR EVEN LATER
LOOK UPON IT MY DARLING AS A SETTLED THING AND DO NOT DISTURB WITH THE THOUGHT OF ANY INDECISION THE GREAT JOY WHICH OUGHT TO BE YOURS THERE IS A RING AT THE HALL DOOR CRIED LESLIE
YOU'LL DO CRIED BELLE
OH GO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE A NICE POSITION YOU'LL BE IN HE SAID WITH A SNEER
I DON'T CARE FOR THAT SHORT HAIR
BUT THE WORLD HAS HER IN ITS GRIP
A STORY OF SAN FRANCISCO
ALL THREE GIRLS KNEW WELL THAT WHEN MRS CHETWYND WENT AS FAR AS THAT THE THING WAS ACCOMPLISHED
DON'T FRET TOO MUCH
NO PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS SEEM TO MATTER AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED SAID LESLIE WITH A SMILE
THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO ME--I MAY MAKE A NOTE THROUGH MY BRAIN MAY BE EVOLVED AN IDEA WHICH A CARELESS HOUSEMAID MAY THROW INTO THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET
I HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ON YOUR MUSIC AND SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE RESULT MARJORIE ROSE WENT TO THE PIANO SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO THUNDER LOUDLY
YOU SEE BY THAT FACT ANNIE THAT I AM NOT A RICH GIRL AND THAT I KNOW ABOUT POVERTY
SHE VENTURED TO CALL ANNIE'S NAME SOFTLY
WE DID NOT LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE AT ST WODE'S BUT WE HAVE MET OFTEN
AND YET IF THIS LETTER IS TRUE SHE IS A SLY CUNNING LITTLE ROGUE AS SLY AND CUNNING AS CAN BE
DO NOT ASK ME ANY MORE I WON'T AND I'LL MANAGE THINGS FOR YOU
I COULD HAVE LOVED YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST HER PERSONALLY EXCEPT THAT SHE DOES NOT TAKE THE BEST THE COLLEGE AFFORDS
I WISH MOTHER WERE HERE
HIS WORE A PERTURBED EXPRESSION
BELLE IS A FRIEND OF OURS
WHAT DO YOU TWO SAY OF COURSE EILEEN AND I WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH SAID MARJORIE
BUT ALAS
ANNIE WE WILL GO TO RICHMOND SO BE IT SAID BELLE
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT SHE HAD GOT A SHOCK
BUT MY CONFESSION COMES FIRST
MRS ACHESON IN HER USUAL SOMEWHAT DIFFIDENT MANNER KISSED MRS CHETWYND AND THEN BELLE FLEW UP TO HER AND GAVE HER A LITTLE PECK ON HER CHEEK
IT WAS OF THE MOST VITAL IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD SEE YOU SO I GOT YOUR ADDRESS FROM YOUR MOTHER
OH I HAVE READ A LOT ABOUT SOCIETY AND ALL ITS TRASH
THIS WILL DO UNTIL WE MEET TO-MORROW
OH I HAVE SET MYSELF SO STRENUOUSLY AGAINST ALL THAT SORT OF THING
HAVE YOU NOT DISCOVERED THAT YET I NEVER THOUGHT OF THE HOTELS SAID MRS ACHESON IN AN APOLOGETIC VOICE
A MAN WITH MR COLCHESTER'S EXTENSIVE TASTES DOUBTLESS CARES LITTLE WHERE HE LAYS HIS HEAD AT NIGHT
I SHALL TAKE MY PASS EXAM AND LET THAT SUFFICE
EILEEN HAS QUITE RECOVERED HER HEALTH AND STRENGTH
NEW YORK GROSSET DUNLAP PUBLISHERS CONTENTS CHAPTER I--PREPARING FOR THE YOUNG DEBUTANTES
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A KEEN PLEASURE IT IS TO ME TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU ON THAT ACCOUNT
WHY DEAR ME LESLIE HOW VERY QUICKLY YOU GOT HERE AND YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE QUITE AT HOME
WE MUST EACH WALK ACCORDING TO OUR OWN LIGHTS
THE THOUGHT OF THE PICTURE MADE HIS HEART HAPPY EVEN NOW
SHE WAS TREMBLING SO EXCESSIVELY THAT SHE NEARLY FELL
WHAT A LONG TIME YOU HAVE BEEN SHE SAID
I SEE BY THE BUILD OF YOUR HEAD AND YOUR FIGURE THAT YOU ARE PAINFULLY TIDY SHE SAID
I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART OF COURSE AND YOU TOO MISS--MISS--I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME YOU HAD BETTER NOT KNOW IT
HE DREW HER HAND THROUGH HIS ARM AND INVITED HER TO WALK WITH HIM
THEY WERE ALL SEATED AT THE DIFFERENT TABLES WHEN ANNIE COLCHESTER AND LESLIE GILROY APPEARED
I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD DO IT
PLEASE GIVE THE MONEY TO ANNIE AT ONCE FOR THE MATTER IS MOST URGENT
WELL IT IS LIKE ANY OTHER PART I SUPPOSE
LETITIA OF COURSE LOOKED ALL THAT WAS SWEET AND NICE
I DON'T WANT SHE ADDED TO GET INTO ANY SET
HE WAS NOT AT ALL PRYING
I PUT A DRESS ON IN THE MORNING--I TAKE IT OFF AT NIGHT
YOU WILL LIKE THAT CHAIR WHICH FACES THE VIEW
BUT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH A CERTAIN HARSHNESS OF THE COLCHESTERS
HER OWN SPECIAL FRIENDS HAD ALREADY RETIRED TO THEIR ROOMS
AT THE END OF THAT TIME WHERE AM I SHE STOOD UP AND HELD OUT HER EMPTY PALMS
GRANTED
I NEVER KNEW I COULD FEEL SO BITTER TOWARDS ANYONE YOU WILL GET OVER IT DEAR AND AFTER ALL AS RUPERT SAYS OH PLEASE DON'T MENTION HIS NAME ANNIE LOOKED AT HER A FROWN COMING BETWEEN HER BROWS
I AM TRULY SORRY FOR POOR LESLIE
MUCH BETTER THAN VISITING THEM CRIED LETITIA
MARJORIE AND I MEAN TO DO GREAT GOOD IN THE WORLD THEN IF YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE SAID BELLE JUMPING TO HER FEET YOU WILL COME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ST WODE'S
YES MOTHER SHE CRIED DO LET MR PARKER DRIVE YOU
SHE WAS A PLAIN GIRL AND SHE GLORIED IN THE FACT
AS SHE SPOKE SHE HELD OUT HER HAND FOR THE KEYS OF THEIR TRUNKS
POOR MOTHER
WE ARE IN THE VAN AND IN THE VAN WE WILL STAY
YOU WILL FEEL MUCH WORSE IF YOU DO NOT
HIS HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WARS BETWEEN YORK AND LANCASTER IN EIGHT BOOKS WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1595
OH DEAR DEAR IT IS SUCH A WORRY EVEN TO SPEAK ABOUT IT
BUT BELLE BEING THE CHILD ALLOTTED TO HER BY PROVIDENCE SHE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BEST OF HER NOT TO ATTEMPT TO TURN HER INTO ANY OTHER GROOVE AND TO ENDEAVOR TO COUNTERACT HER ECCENTRICITIES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
IT WAS IDOLATRY AND I AM PUNISHED GO ON WITH YOUR STORY SAID MR PARKER
BUT WHAT A DEAR DELICIOUS CREATURE YOU ARE BELLE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE BEST FOR ME TO SEND HIM A TELEGRAM
I CAN NEVER EAT WHEN MY BRAIN IS ON FIRE HAVE YOU NOTHING IN THE ROOM NOW--BISCUITS OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT I HAVE A DIM SORT OF IDEA THAT A TIN OF VERY STALE BISCUITS STANDS BEHIND THAT RUBBISH ON THE TOP OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS STALE AS THEY ARE THEY WILL BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LESLIE FOLLOWED HER
HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND
YOU AND I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING OF SUCH TEMPTATION
TO TAKE A LETTER PURPORTING TO BE WRITTEN IN HER HAND TO MR PARKER TO BORROW MONEY IN HER NAME TO GET MR PARKER TO THINK SO BADLY OF HER
THIS SONG AGAIN BROUGHT THE WIDOW TO THE VERGE OF TEARS
WELL THIS LIFE IS INTERESTING IS IT NOT EILEEN CHAPTER XII INKY ANNIE
I DON'T MEAN TO RUIN YOU IT WAS NOW ANNIE'S TURN TO LOOK PALE
I HAVE PLENTY OF WORK AND I AM PAID FAIRLY WELL
SHE IS ONE OF THE TUTORS IS SHE NOT OH YES SUCH A DARLING
BUT ALREADY THE KEENEST SENSE OF DISILLUSIONMENT IS MINE
SHE SAT DOWN ON THE NEAREST SEAT AND COVERED HER FACE WITH HER TREMBLING HANDS
THERE IS A VACANCY AND SHE HAS HALF PROMISED IT TO ME

BUT COULD GET LITTLE OR NOTHING OUT OF HER AND CONCLUDED THAT SHE WAS STUNNED BY THE SUDDEN SHOCK
YOU DO MAKE ME SO PERFECTLY WRETCHED SAID POOR ANNIE
I DO NOT FEEL PHYSICAL SUFFERING SAID BELLE
A MOMENT LATER ALL EAGERNESS QUITE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT THE SHREWD MAN OF BUSINESS WAS COMPARING BOTH WRITINGS
THEN SHE SIGHED AND STOPPED
YOU MUST SEE YOUR CHARMING LITTLE ROOMS
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING OF YOU
ARE YOU NOT DELIGHTED
YES MOTHER SHE ANSWERED PUTTING HER HAND TO HER FOREHEAD AND ARRANGING HER SHORT LOCKS INTO POSITION
SHE SAW THAT THE GIRL FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO REPLY THAT HER LIPS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES SHINING THROUGH TEARS
THEY KNOW ME FOR I HAVE BEEN HERE OFTEN
HOW ARE YOU BELLE WELL THANK YOU REPLIED BELLE IN AN ABSENT VOICE
I AM VERY GLAD YOU ARE STAYING FOR MY PART LESLIE WROTE A SHORT NOTE

NOTHING MOTHER

BELLE IS SUCH AN ODDITY THAT IF SOMETHING IS NOT DONE TO SAVE HER SHE WILL SOON LOSE HER SENSES
THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN BELLE DID NOT WAIT FOR MRS CHETWYND'S MOST UNWILLING PERMISSION
MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALWAYS BEEN WAYWARD CHILDREN DIFFICULT TO MANAGE
SHE CAME QUICKLY ACROSS THE ROOM AND LOOKED FULL AT LESLIE
NOW HAVE A GOOD TEA MY DARLING FOR WE HAVE MUCH TO TALK OF AFTERWARDS
THE LIGHTS WERE ALL OUT
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY SLEEP
I AM CURIOUS TO SEE POOR OLD BELLE
LESLIE STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT WITH A SENSE OF DISMAY STEALING OVER HER
WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT OUR BODIES WHILE WE LIVE
WE WILL BE NUNS IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD
SHE FLUNG HER HEAD DOWN AGAIN ON HER PILLOW
BY THIS TIME RUPERT HAD PERAMBULATED ALMOST EVERY FOOT OF THE DRAWING-ROOM
WE THINK THE SAME WE DO EVERYTHING THE SAME
YOU HAVE CHANGED ALL MY LIFE YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE STILL FRETTING OVER THAT MATTER
BUT IT IS TO BE DOUBTED IF SHE SAW IT

I WANT JUST TO BE USEFUL ALTHOUGH I AM AFRAID I AM A BIT OF A FAILURE ALL ROUND
NOTHING MORE NATURAL BUT RUPERT YOU MUST NOT--IT WOULD BE MOST DANGEROUS WHY SHOULD IT BE DANGEROUS
AN HOUR LATER HE CAME BACK
DOES IT STIMULATE THE BRAIN TO KEEP THE FEET UPON A CARPET
SHE MADE A VALIANT EFFORT NOT TO SPEAK
HIS FACE CHANGED COLOR IT LENGTHENED AND SEEMED TO GROW THINNER AND MORE HAGGARD EACH MOMENT
ANNIE MISSED HER COMPANION'S GENTLE ATTENTIONS
WHERE COULD SHE GET WORK
HE MUST NEVER COME BACK TO ENGLAND
YOURS IS THE INTELLECTUAL THE SPIRITUAL THE GOLD WHICH IS TREASURED IN THE GREAT STOREHOUSES OF THE PAST AS BELLE SPOKE SHE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM

I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A ROOM
GOD ANSWERS TO EACH OF YOU YOU ARE THE WORLD SAYS NO I AM NOT BUT GOD SAYS YES YOU ARE ALL MEN ARE YOUR BROTHERS

YOUR BROTHER
DO LET US HEAR SAID EILEEN
HE LOOKED FROM ANNIE TO LESLIE
ONCE FOR ALL MY MIND IS MADE UP WHAT WOULD OUR FATHER HAVE SAID SHE CRIED
I HAVE KNOWN HER BROTHER FOR A YEAR OR TWO
THAT IS THE ONLY WORD I CAN SAY FOR HER I MUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT HOWEVER MATTERS TURN OUT SAID LESLIE
IT HAD SOME OF THOSE QUEER LITTLE THINGS THEY CALL BACILLI IN IT AND DR ERICSON SAID THEY WERE THE BACILLI OF TYPHOID FEVER
BY THE WAY MARJORIE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU OUGHT TO BE SHORT-SIGHTED OUGHT TO BE SHORT-SIGHTED SAID MARJORIE
YOU ARE PUTTING IT ON AND THAT DOES NOT SUIT A MAN OF MY CALIBER AT ALL

DO YOU MEAN TO COME WITH ME OR NOT I SHOULD LIKE TO COME SAID ANNIE
DO YOU MEAN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ANNIE STARTED UP NOW CAME CLOSE TO LESLIE AND TRIED TO TAKE HER HAND
I HAVE PLACED MYSELF HIGH ABOVE THE MERE INFLUENCE OF THE WEATHER
THE GIRL AT THE DISTANT WINDOW THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE TURNED AND EAGERLY FACED HER COMPANIONS
IT WILL BE QUITE CONVENIENT
THAT VIEW UPSETS ME WHEN I AM VERY BUSY OVER MY STUDIES
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I REQUIRE FOR MY ROOM
LESLIE WENT UP AND TOUCHED HER ON HER SHOULDER
MY TREASURES SAID BELLE COLOR AND ANIMATION RUSHING INTO HER FACE
I SAID LAST NIGHT THAT YOU WERE VERY ILL
YOU CANNOT THINK HOW NICE OLD FORREST HAS BEEN ABOUT THIS
LETITIA IN PALE-BLUE SILK WITH LACE RUFFLES LOOKED NEAT PRETTY AND SUITABLY ATTIRED
ANNIE HAD HURT HER TOO DEEPLY
IT CONTAINED A REQUEST TO GIVE ME BECAUSE I HAD GONE INTO DEBT SIXTY POUNDS

HAVE YOU FOR INSTANCE EVER DIPPED DEEP INTO THE INTRICACIES OF VIRGIL NEVER SAID EILEEN
OH ANNIE I KNOW YOU ARE DREADFULLY UNHAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING AND I WISH I COULD COMFORT YOU
MR PARKER WILL SEE YOU IN FIVE MINUTES HE SAID

ANNIE DID NOT STIR
MY ONE INTEREST IN LIFE IS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HERE HE GLANCED AT LESLIE BUT THE NEXT MOMENT LOOKED AWAY
CHAPTER VIII--THE GILROYS
BUT STAY--I WONDER IF MR PARKER NO NO I COULD NOT--I COULD NOT ASK HIM LESLIE DRESSED HASTILY PUT HER PART OF THE ROOM IN ORDER OPENED HER WINDOW WIDE AND THEN RAN DOWN TO BREAKFAST
LETITIA REMAINED BEHIND
THIS MAY BE THE TURNING-POINT
YOU WILL GO WILL YOU NOT I SHALL STAY WITH YOU SAID LESLIE IN A DOGGED SORT OF VOICE
ALL MY LIFE I MUST THANK HER FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE FOR YOU THIS IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR CRIED LESLIE
FOR MY WHOLE HEART ACHES YES--WHETHER YOU WILL BELIEVE IT OR NOT--AT THE CRUEL CHANGE IN OUR POSITIONS
THIS POWERFUL NOVEL IS THE FICTITIOUS NARRATIVE OF A DEAL IN THE CHICAGO WHEAT PIT AND HOLDS THE READER FROM THE BEGINNING
MRS CHETWYND WENT ON TO THE NEXT ROOM
I HAVE PASSED RIGHT THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL FROM THE BEGINNING AND NO GIRL WHO DOES THAT CAN BE SAID TO BE IGNORANT
YOU MUST NOT THINK ME BETTER THAN I DESERVE
THERE NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN TWO JENNIES IN THIS WICKED OLD WORLD
WELL SIR HE SAID FINALLY YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND
BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE HERS
WILL YOU HAVE SOME SAL-VOLATILE OR EAU-DE-COLOGNE
WHAT IS IT WHEN MY NERVES ARE RUFFLED I ALWAYS FIND THAT RECITATION IS THE GREATEST HELP TO ME SAID BELLE
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE STILLNESS IN THE HOUSE FOR LETTIE HAD GONE OUT TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH A FRIEND
SO IF IT IS YOUR WISH YOU HAVE ONLY TO SAY THE WORD
BUT WITH HER AND HERS I HAVE NOTHING TO DO
YOU ARE NOT TO TAKE THE LITTLE DEAR FROM ME SAID THE FIRST GIRL
SHE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOR AND COULD SEE NO FUN IN EILEEN'S REMARK
BUT YOU WILL LEARN DOUBTLESS
SHE HAS WORKED RATHER HARD THAT IS ALL THEN WE WILL GIVE HER A RIGHT GOOD TIME
LESLIE IS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE BELOVED THAN EVER BY ALL THOSE WHO KNOW HER
DO GIVE ME YOUR HAND
THERE WILL BE FEWER AND FEWER AS TIME GOES ON
I WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION CONTINUED ANNIE RAISING HER PATHETIC HALF-STARVED EYES TO MRS ACHESON'S FACE FOR I HAVE NO HOME AT PRESENT DEAR DEAR MY POOR CHILD
I WAS NEARLY MAD
MR PARKER IS A MAN OF PECULIAR VIEWS SAID THE MOTHER
YOU ARE A NICE CREATURE
I REPEAT ONCE AGAIN THAT THERE ARE NO TWO SIDES
BEING LESLIE GILROY OF COURSE I CANNOT REFUSE YOU ANYTHING IN REASON YOU ARE DOING MUCH FOR ME
THE GIRL BUSTLED ABOUT THE ROOM PREPARING ANNIE'S BATH
GOOD-BY DREAMS BUT BY AND BY AS LLEWELLYN THOUGHT HE RAISED HIS FACE AND GAZING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM HE SAW ANOTHER VISION AND THAT VISION COMFORTED AND STRENGTHENED HIM A GOOD BIT
YOU COULD REJOICE WITH ME LESLIE GLANCED AT HER WITH A SMILE
DON'T YOU TROUBLE SHE NODDED TO MRS CHETWYND AND TO HER MOTHER IN A FRIENDLY OFFHAND STYLE AND LEFT THE ROOM
BUT STAY
YOU ARE NEITHER OF YOU BEGINNING YOUR COLLEGE LIFE AS I COULD HAVE HOPED
BUT NOW MISS LESLIE I HAVE COME DOWN HERE BECAUSE I AM A LITTLE ALARMED WITH REGARD TO YOU A LITTLE ALARMED WITH REGARD TO ME
HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE MUST NOT GIVE HERSELF AWAY
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE BOX WAS FULL OF VALUABLES AND DEAR BRAVE LITTLE ANNIE HAS RESCUED THEM
MR PARKER ASKED IF HE MIGHT COME ROUND AND BE INTRODUCED TO YOU ALL

YOU CAN GO ON WITH YOUR QUARREL WHEN I AM AWAY
OH YOU'LL HELP ME
THE GIRL IS DIFFERENT
THE GIRL IS DIFFERENT
BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE YOU THINK
I AM OFF NOW TO SEE MISS LAUDERDALE AND TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY RUDENESS IN NOT COMING TO THE MEETING LAST NIGHT
THE HAND CLUTCHED THE SLIGHT ROUND ARM SO FIRMLY THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY POOR LESLIE COULD SUPPRESS A SCREAM
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF MR ESSEX BEFORE
I WAS SO MISERABLE I FELT FIT TO KILL MYSELF
THE CHILD WAS LIKE HER IN THE EXTERNAL FEATURES ONLY PLEASE SPEAK REPEATED LESLIE
IT WAS NICE TO FEEL YOU KNEELING BY MY SIDE
YOUR FRIENDS ARE RICH SHE CONTINUED
AND YOU--YOU PROMISED TO HELP HIM
I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE AND PERPLEXITY
WHEN THE GREAT CLOCK OVER EAST HALL SOUNDED THE HOUR OF ELEVEN SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY INACTIVE ANY LONGER
I HAVE ONLY BEEN THINKING BUT WHAT ABOUT MY BOY MRS GILROY SELDOM PETTED HER CHILDREN SHE SELDOM USED LOVING WORDS TO THEM
AND HE HAS NOW PRESENTED A THIRD NOVEL BLIX WHICH IS IN SOME RESPECTS THE FINEST AND LIKELY TO BE THE MOST POPULAR OF THE THREE."--_WASHINGTON TIMES BLIX
IT WAS ABOUT THE CHEEKIEST BOLDEST CLEVEREST DEED THAT ANY GIRL EVER DID AND YOU DID IT FOR YOUR BROTHER'S SAKE
IT WILL BE VERY CURIOUS IF IT IS TRUE
BE QUICK BE QUICK ANNIE DRAGGED LESLIE BY HER ARM NOT ALLOWING HER TIME TO UTTER ANOTHER WORD
WHAT IS IT ASKED LESLIE
BY THE WAY HAVE YOU READ IT--'THE CAXTONS BY BULWER LYTTON YES
I CAN NEVER GO TO ST WODE'S UNLESS I MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF ALL THAT IS IN MY MIND
I MUST GO ON WITH MY CALCULUS OF FINITE DIFFERENCES WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED LESLIE
I SHALL GO ABOUT FROM ONE FASHIONABLE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND AMUSE MYSELF AND TRY TO FORGET THAT I HAVE CHILDREN
SHE MAY BE IN THE BEST SENSE WOMANLY WITHOUT SINKING INTO A NONENTITY MISS FRERE'S WORDS WERE FULL OF FEELING AND LESLIE LISTENED TO HER WITH AN EVER-GROWING ADMIRATION
BUT ONLY ON A CONDITION
LESLIE'S LIPS FORMED A VOICELESS NO BELLE UNDERSTOOD HER
SHE HAS NOT TOLD
THAT SHE LOVED HER WITH A WORSHIP WHICH WAS ALMOST IDOLATRY THAT SHE WAS A SHADE MORE PROUD OF HER AND DREAMT MORE DAYDREAMS ABOUT HER THAN ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHERS
LET ME SEE
ANNIE GOT STILL DEEPER INTO THE SHADOW OF THE THICK CURTAINS AND WAITED
DID YOU EVER HAVE A WATCH WITH A BROKEN SPRING I THINK SO
THIS IS OUR DEBATE EVENING SHE SAID
WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT MY CONDITION IS
IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT ME ANNIE MOVED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO TAKE OFF HER THINGS
WHAT A MERCY SHE IS NOT STEERING THOUGHT LESLIE TO HERSELF
HOW LUXURIOUS THIS ROOM IS SHE SAID
IF I COULD BLEED HIM TO THAT EXTENT I WOULD RIGHT HEARTILY
AND YOU HAVE NO MEN ON THE PREMISES HAVE YOU NO SAID BELLE
CHAPTER XXVIII--RUPERT
FOR THOUGH HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT AS THEY CALL THEM HE HAD NO HIGH AND MIGHTY HAW-HAW IDEAS AND HE WAS GOOD TO ME AND WOULDN'T LET THE OTHER FELLOWS TRAMPLE ON ME--NOT HE NOT HE

LESLIE SAT DOWN ON IT JUST AS IF SOMEBODY HAD SHOT HER
DEAR ME ANNIE SHE SAID I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED ABOUT YOU DON'T BEGIN SAID ANNIE
YOU ARE MUCH TOO FLUSHED YOUR EYES ARE TOO FULL OF ANXIETY
BELLE ACHESON WAS HERE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THIS MORNING

SO YOU HAVE REALLY SENT HER TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE YES
BUT ALL HER THOUGHTS WERE IN A WHIRL
BUT SHE WOULD SING SHADOWLAND IF MRS CHETWYND WISHED IT
IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL GET THE MONEY-BOX NOW AND COUNT MY SAVINGS
SINCE THEN RUPERT AND I HAVE BEEN PRACTICALLY ALONE
I AM AFRAID I CANNOT REPLIED LESLIE
HOW COULD SHE STAND IT
BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE HERSELF WAS SEEING VISIONS
BUT SURELY YOU COULD HELP HER MUCH MORE EFFECTUALLY IN THE LONG RUN BY DOING WHAT MR PARKER WISHES
THIS OLD SERGE IS SO THICK AND HOT BUT IF YOU PUT ON A WHITE SHIRT DEAR YOU WILL LOOK AS NEAT AND NICE AS POSSIBLE SAID LESLIE
ANOTHER A STRANGER HAD APPROACHED MR PARKER ON HER BEHALF
YOU LOOK AS IF SOMETHING WAS WORRYING YOU SOMETHING IS REPLIED LESLIE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL OH I WON'T PRESS YOU REPLIED JANE
DINNER PASSED QUICKLY FOR ALL THREE GIRLS WERE HUNGRY
SHE WAS THINKING HARD
ANNIE LOOKED UP AS SHE CAME IN
THIS WILL KILL ME SHE MUTTERED
BUT NOW IF YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WON'T CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ILL-USED MARTYR SIMPLY BECAUSE MOTHER HAS TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU OH I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT MYSELF A MARTYR SAID ANNIE
AS TO TIDINESS I HAVE KNOWN MYSELF TO FLING A BOOK FROM ONE END OF THE ROOM TO THE OTHER IN A FIT OF EXCITEMENT
ARE FOUR TABLES REQUIRED
EILEEN WAS PUTTING SOME PINS INTO A GREAT RENT IN HER PETTICOAT
WE SHALL BE GOING DOWN TO DINNER IN LESS THAN AN HOUR ANNIE STIFLED A SIGH AND ONCE MORE RESUMED HER BOOK
THE DELIGHTFUL MOTION OF THE EASY CARRIAGE IN WHICH SHE WAS SEATED THE SOFT BREEZES ON HER CHEEKS MRS ACHESON'S KIND AND INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION RETURNED TO HER MEMORY AGAIN AND AGAIN
WHAT WORK COULD SHE BEST UNDERTAKE
BUT MY DEAR LET ME ASK YOU JUST ONCE WHY DID YOU DO IT OH YOU ARE DRIVING ME MAD SAID POOR LESLIE
IT REMAINS WITH YOURSELF TO MAKE YOUR ROOM PRETTY AND NEAT OR THE REVERSE
IF I HAD HAD A SON OF MY OWN I COULD ONLY WISH THAT HE HAD BEEN OF SIMILAR METAL
I DON'T WISH TO BE UNGRATEFUL
WHATEVER YOU DO I SHALL ALWAYS FEEL GLAD THAT I BELONG TO YOU
WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING THERE CAME A SOFT TAP AT THE DOOR
I HOPE YOU LIKED THAT FUGUE SHE SAID
BUT AS I AM HER ONLY CHILD SHE GIVES ME PLENTY OF MONEY FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE
AND YOU ARE PERFECTLY WELCOME TO SPEAK OF ME AS THE ODDITY OF ALL ODDITIES
SHE WAS WEARING AN UNTIDY SERGE SKIRT AND A LOOSE ILL-FITTING WASHING BLOUSE
THEY ALL LOOKED CAPABLE AND CLEVER THE SORT WHO WOULD WRITE HIS LETTERS AND ATTEND TO HIS CORRESPONDENCE AND KEEP THINGS GOING FOR HIM
I WOULD NOT WAKE HER FOR THE WORLD
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER WITH HER SHE THOUGHT
CERTAINLY MY LOVE YOU SHALL GO
DO YOU QUITE REALIZE BOTH OF YOU WHAT ANNIE COLCHESTER HAS DONE I REALIZE IT FAST ENOUGH SAID COLCHESTER
OH PLEASE SHE TURNED TO SPEAK TO MISS PAYNE BUT MISS PAYNE HAD ALREADY VANISHED
THEN TOO THEIR MANNERS WERE ECCENTRIC
GO AWAY TAKE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE OUT OF MY SIGHT
WELL MISS COLCHESTER HE SAID MAY I ASK WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS VISIT
THEY WERE PINK AND VERY SMALL
LET HIM GO SHE SAID
ONE CANNOT READ IT WITHOUT A RESPONSIVE THRILL OF SYMPATHY FOR THE EARNESTNESS THE BREADTH OF PURPOSE THE VERBAL POWER OF THE MAN
YOU ARE NOW VERGING INTO THE COMMONPLACE
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE SERVICES OF A MAID TO SAVE MY LIFE
HE STOOPED AND PICKED IT UP AND THE NEXT MOMENT HIS RED FACE HAD TURNED PALE FOR LESLIE'S SCRIBBLE CARELESSLY WRITTEN AS IT WAS SEEMED TO HIM TO BE WRITTEN IN A DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT HAND FROM THAT OF THE LETTER
ALL RIGHT
HAVE YOU GOT ANOTHER POST
HAVING SUFFICIENT CLOTHES TO COVER OURSELVES THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
LAY THEM ON THE BED
JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR WAS QUICKLY OPENED AND MARJORIE RUSHED IN
COME SIT HERE AND I WILL SIT NEAR YOU
BUT THERE ONCE FOR ALL I WILL NOT DRAG JENNY INTO THIS
WILL YOU TAKE THAT TO MR PARKER NOW SHE SAID
SHE WAS TERRIBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT ANNIE
YOU ARE A KIND OF MAGICIAN BELLE YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE FRIVOLS
SHE WENT UP TO LESLIE HALF-BENT FORWARD AS IF SHE MEANT TO KISS HER THEN CHANGED HER MIND AND A MOMENT AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM
THEN FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T WEAR THAT PENSIVE AIR
MEANTIME WE CAN SURELY LET THE SUBJECT OF DRESS DROP BUT DEAR MOTHER DID YOU SAY WE HAD COME HOME FOR GOOD CRIED MARJORIE
CHAPTER XXXIII--CONFESSION
I SHALL WATCH HER
MAY I INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS LESLIE GILROY PRAY COME IN MISS GILROY
HER TONE WAS STILL ICY-COLD AND THE WANT OF SYMPATHY IN HER EYES CAUSED ANNIE'S DARK RED-BROWN ONES TO FLASH ANGRILY
HOW STUPID OF ME TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT HER SHE THOUGHT WITH COMPUNCTION
I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM AT ONCE
IF SHE DIES I SHALL DIE BUT SHE SHALL NOT DIE DEAR OH I KNOW BUT SHE IS IN SUCH TERRIBLE DANGER NOW
OR WE OUR ACTIONS MAKE THEM WAIT UPON PUTTING THEM IN THE LIVERY OF OUR SKILL AND CAST THEM OFF AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE DONE HERE BELLE RAISED HERSELF IN THE BOAT
I'VE ONLY GOT FOURTEEN SHILLINGS NOT A PENNY MORE RUPERT GAVE VENT TO A PROLONGED WHISTLE
NOW THEN YOU YOUNG ONES IT IS TIME FOR BED
HE SHOOK THE KINDLY HAND OFF AND STEPPED BACK A FOOT
THE DRIVE WAS A LONG ONE BUT PRESENTLY SHE REACHED HER DESTINATION
BUT I'LL SEE LLEWELLYN
WHAT CAN BE UP SAID LESLIE TO HERSELF
DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN MY MEANING IS PLAIN ENOUGH
OF COURSE SHE IS GUILTY
HE IS GOING TO DECIDE TO-DAY LESLIE STRUGGLED WITH HERSELF
IN THAT HUMBLE LITTLE DESK THERE LIES IN NOTES AND GOLD OVER EIGHTY POUNDS
THAT BROW AND THOSE EYES WERE NOT GIVEN YOU FOR NOTHING
THEN I LOST MY INTEREST IN MY WORK
THIS IS REALLY KIND OF YOU SAID LESLIE
I HAVE NEVER EVEN SEEN HER
I'LL DO MY BEST FOR YOU ANNIE ONLY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T THANK ME THE GIRLS FOUND THEMSELVES NOW IN QUEEN VICTORIA STREET
MY OWN WIFE IS DEAD AND MY--MY GIRL TOO
BUT I MUST NOT STAY HERE LONG TO-DAY FOR I HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO
TOO UPSET TO ASK POOR GIRL SAID THE DOCTOR
YOU KNOW IT IS NOT ONLY A REQUEST
I HAVE A BROTHER
MY DISAPPOINTMENT HAS BEEN DEEP WITH REGARD TO MISS GILROY WHETHER YOU ARE DISAPPOINTED IN ME OR NOT PLEASE TRY TO ENLIGHTEN ME BY YOUR RECITATION SAID LESLIE FOR I SHOULD ENJOY IT OF ALL THINGS I DON'T SUPPOSE FOR A SINGLE INSTANT YOU WILL CARE FOR IT
SHE LEADS THE EXTREME PARTY IN THE COLLEGE
SHE'S NOT A BIT SECRETIVE NOW SECRETIVE
LISTEN I MUST HAVE THAT SIXTY POUNDS BY HOOK OR BY CROOK
SO FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY YOU WILL KEEP WHAT YOU KNOW IN THE DARK
IN SUCH TONES WITH ALMOST SIMILAR WORDS HAD HER OWN MOTHER OFTEN SPOKEN TO HER
HIP
PROVE IT NOW AND THIS WOULD MAKE YOU QUITE HAPPY MY DEAR IT WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY I SHOULD SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO CONTAIN MYSELF
ANNIE COLCHESTER CALLED AT MY OFFICE YESTERDAY
TO HEAR HER SING YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT SHE WAS THE MOST SENTIMENTAL CREATURE IN THE WORLD
HOW DO DEARS BOTH SHE SAID IN A FRIENDLY VOICE
THIS IS NOT AS SUDDEN AS IT LOOKS TO YOU
GOOD-BY LESLIE
SHE OPENED HER PRETTY EYES WIDE AND THE COLOR RUSHED INTO HER FACE
AT LEAST NEVER CONFIDE IN ME
THIS LARGE ROOM AT ST WODE'S HAD BEEN MORE OR LESS OF A WORRY TO THE GOVERNORS AND IT WAS FINALLY SETTLED WHEN ANNIE'S TIME TO LEAVE THE COLLEGE ARRIVED THAT IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY A PARTITION AND LET IN FUTURE TO TWO STUDENTS
THE GIRL STRETCHED OUT HER PALM AND THE OTHER GIRL PLACED THE LITTLE FOOT UPON IT
KITTY PUT A QUANTITY OF HONEY ON HER PLATE
WITH HER AND OPEN SIN THERE WAS NOTHING WHATEVER IN COMMON
ONLY FOURTEEN SHILLINGS BETWEEN ME AND THE WORLD BUT MR PARKER WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE SITUATION IF I ASK HIM CONTINUED LESLIE
BUT FEW PEOPLE CAN RENDER THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS TO SATISFACTION LETITIA VOLUNTEERED TO TRY
I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE GOT ONE AT LAST SHE TOOK THE LETTER AS SHE SPOKE OVER TO ANNIE WHO STARTED UP DROPPED HER PEN AND STOOD WITH BOTH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
FINE YOUNG CHAP MRS GILROY
CHAPTER XII--INKY ANNIE
HAD A GOOD TIME SHE ASKED IN A LIGHT CARELESS SORT OF VOICE
HE HATES THE SHOP AND HE WON'T GO INTO BUSINESS FOR HE CAN'T STAND IT AND SO HIS FATHER HAS TO START HIM IN A PROFESSION
THE LITTLE WEEK WHICH LAY BEFORE HER WAS AN OASIS IN THE DESERT
OH DEAR WHAT IS TO BE DONE
I LITTLE THOUGHT THAT I WAS TO BE INFLICTED WITH BELLE ACHESON SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T WISH FOR YOU LETTIE SO YOU NEEDN'T TAKE HER UP UNLESS YOU LIKE SAID EILEEN
TWO--HAVE YOU TWO I CANNOT TELL YOU REPLIED BELLE TURNING HER EYES TOWARDS EILEEN AND LOOKING AT HER AS IF SHE DID NOT SEE HER
ONE BY ONE THE MANY STUDENTS FILED IN AND TOOK THEIR PLACES
IT WOULD BE BETRAYING NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT RUPERT
I SAW HIM TO-DAY AND I ACCEPTED IT MOTHER SUBJECT TO YOUR LEAVE WHICH OF COURSE YOU WILL GIVE
WHY SO BECAUSE MY SISTER AND I--I AM SURE I CAN SPEAK FOR HER AS WELL AS MYSELF--HAVE COME HERE FOR A DEFINITE PURPOSE
WHEN MY OWN MONEY WAS NEARLY GONE I WENT TO LESLIE
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ME GO TOO YOU LETTIE
IS IT NOT BRAVE OF HER I HAVE NOT TOLD SAID LESLIE
DON'T YOU THINK ANNIE YOU ARE A LITTLE UNKIND TO ME REPLIED LESLIE
I WANT YOUR WHOLE THREEFOLD NATURE TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE TRAINING WHILE YOU ARE UNDER MY CARE AND I THINK THAT YOU GIRLS OF ST WODE'S OUGHT TO TAKE STEPS TO KEEP THE SOULS WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THE UNDYING SOULS STRONG AND IN HEALTH HEAR HEAR
TWO YEARS AGO MRS CHETWYND ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND A DISTINGUISHED INDIAN OFFICER HAD RETURNED TO ENGLAND
WHAT WAS SHE TO DO
I WAS AT HIS OFFICE THIS MORNING
MISS COLCHESTER IS A WELL-MEANING CREATURE
SHE THEN EXTENDED AN AWKWARD HAND
AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM NEXT TO THE ONE AT WHICH SHE WAS KNOCKING WAS OPENED AND SUSAN MERRIMAN LOOKED OUT
I WONDER LESLIE IF YOU WERE EVER HUNGRY HUNGRY TO THE POINT OF STARVATION WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED LESLIE
THEY WERE THEN CONDUCTED TO THEIR ROOMS AT THE FARTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
I WILL GO AND FIND YOUR MOTHER MARJORIE FLOPPED DOWN AGAIN ON THE BED SEIZED THE PILLOW CLASPED IT IN HER ARMS AND BURIED HER HEAD IN IT
HE HAD BRAINS ENOUGH BUT NOTHING ELSE THE SCOUNDREL ANNIE BIT HER LIPS UNTIL THE BLOOD NEARLY CAME
THERE IS A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN BELLE AND SHE IS LESS ARROGANT THAN FORMERLY ALTHOUGH SHE STILL FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE TRUE AIM OF A WOMAN'S LIFE IS TO DELVE IN THE RICH SOIL OF PAST LITERATURE AND NOT TO TROUBLE HERSELF MUCH ABOUT THE FUTURE
NOW RUPERT SEEMS TO TAKE IT AS THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EXISTENCE
I STOOD IN THE SHADOW AND I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
THEN LEW YOU WILL BE REALLY HELPING HER AT OXFORD
BUT IF YOU ASK ME FOR MONEY AND SAY YOU WANT IT AND GIVE ME A GOOD REASON--EVEN IF IT IS TO BUY A SMART FROCK OR PRETTY HAT--YOU SHALL HAVE IT CHILD
BID YOUR SISTER GOOD-BY AND GO OH I CANNOT CANNOT PART WITH YOU RUPERT CRIED ANNIE
THERE HE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH CHIEF-INSPECTOR JONES GOT THE ADDRESS OF A SPECIAL EXPERT OF HANDWRITING AND DROVE OFF TO THE MAN'S HOUSE
HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET THAT MONEY
I DARE SAY YOU DON'T BUT MY TIME IS ALL MARKED OUT--I KEEP A TIME-TABLE AND ADHERE TO IT RIGIDLY
I SHOULD SO LIKE TO BRUSH OFF THE MUD FROM THE TAIL OF YOUR SKIRT THANK YOU THANK YOU
IF RUPERT DARED TO ASK BELLE TO LEND HIM ANY OF THE MONEY IN THE WOODEN BOX SHE WOULD CONFESS ALL
LESLIE DID NOT REPLY
HE TALKED TO MRS ACHESON BUT HE LOOKED AT BELLE
I KNOW I HAVE A VERY PRETTY FACE
I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SHE CRIED
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED RUPERT BETTER THAN I OUGHT
AND DO YOU KNOW THERE WERE TWENTY GIRLS WAITING TO SEE HIM FOR THIS ONE SITUATION
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH CHANCE OF IT
I HAD LETTERS FROM HER NOW AND THEN AND SHE ALWAYS SPOKE OF YOU WITH GREAT AFFECTION
GOOD-BY SHE SAID RAISING HER FACE TO HIS
WE WILL TAKE A BUS AT THE CORNER AND GET TO NORLAND SQUARE IN NO TIME
BUT LESLIE IS OUR GUEST AND WE MUST CONSULT HER SHE WOULD NOT APPRECIATE SAID BELLE
MAY I NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF WISDOM WHICH DROP FROM YOUR LIPS YOU TALK LETTIE AS IF POOR BELLE WAS MINERVA SAID EILEEN
AT EACH PERUSAL HER SENSE OF DISMAY GREW GREATER
AS TO THE OTHER GIRLS WHOSE OPENING LIVES HAVE BEEN SO BRIEFLY SKETCHED IN THESE PAGES THEY ARE SOME OF THEM STILL UNDERGRADUATES AT ST WODE'S AND SOME ARE STARTING IN THE REAL BATTLE OF LIFE
HE CANNOT PRAISE YOU ENOUGH
MISS BELLE ACHESON HAS HER SPHERE IN LIFE BUT IT IS NOT WHAT SHE THINKS
ONLY WE WERE HOPING FOR SO MUCH--WEREN'T WE HETTY YES SAID HESTER WHO WAS STILL DARNING THE RENT IN HER DRESS
ONLY WOULD YOU GREATLY MIND GOING UPSTAIRS TO WASH YOUR HANDS TIDY YOUR HAIR AND TAKE OFF YOUR DUSTY BOOTS BEFORE DINNER OH DEAR REPLIED BELLE IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE
HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE TABLE WHERE THE WOODEN BOX STOOD LAID HIS HAND ON IT AND WAS ABOUT TO TURN BACK WHEN ANNIE MAKING A SUDDEN MOVEMENT CONFRONTED HIM STANDING IN THE WHITE LIGHT CAUSED BY THE MOON
OH SHE IS CRIED LESLIE
NO YOUNG LADY
IT IS SUCH A CHANCE AND IT WAS PUT IN YOUR WAY LEW
I ONLY KNOW THAT OUR FRIEND'S NAME IS CHARLES PARKER THAT HE MADE HIS FORTUNE IN SYDNEY AND THAT HE IS NOW IN THE CITY ANNIE HEAVED A GREAT SIGH OF MINGLED RELIEF AND PERPLEXITY
HE HAD DONE MUCH FOR HER
DIDN'T YOU KNOW
DOES NOT ONE WANT TO BANG OPEN A DRAWER STUFF IN ONE'S THINGS SHUT IT AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN NOT GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER
ANNIE'S EYES WERE OPEN
NOTHING OF THE KIND REPLIED MRS CHETWYND SLIGHTLY REDDENING
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE SAID TURNING TO HER COMPANION
THERE IS AN EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE LIFE WHICH EXACTLY SUITS ME
HOW PRETTY THE ROOM IS AND EVERYTHING BELONGING TO IT
WE WANT TO GO OUR OWN WAY YOUR OWN WAY EILEEN--YOUR OWN WAY YES MAMMY OUR OWN WAY
AND THE QUEER EXTRAORDINARY THINGS SHE SAID AND THE WAY SHE HURLED HER POOR MOTHER OUT OF THE ROOM I HAVE REALLY NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE
YOU MAY USE LIFE IN ITS FULLNESS OR YOU MAY FRITTER YOUR GIFTS AND BE A DRONE
A FEW MOMENTS LATER PROFOUND SILENCE FELL UPON THE HOUSE
AND HOW DID YOU PASS YOUR FINAL I TOOK AN ORDINARY--NO MORE
CHAPTER XVII THE MERRY ALICE LESLIE KNEW THAT SHE MUST ON NO ACCOUNT AWAKEN HER
ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE SAID I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING
YOU WANT TO GO TO RICHMOND TURNING TO MRS GILROY GO TO RICHMOND YOU SHALL BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING BY TRAIN
AND AS TO RUPERT HIMSELF IT NEEDED ONLY TO LOOK INTO HIS FACE TO SEE HOW WEAK AND WORTHLESS HE WAS
SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE AGAINST THEM
I DO NOT KNOW FOR WHAT SIN I AM DOOMED TO RESIDE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH THAT TERRIBLE GIRL A TERRIBLE GIRL
LESLIE LIT HER CANDLE AND PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS
LESLIE HEARD THE MOAN AND FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET HER
I SHALL CALL IT A HOSTEL FOR THE LOVERS OF PURE LITERATURE
REMEMBER MY DEAR CHILDREN I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR A YEAR
LESLIE I AM IN A GREAT A TERRIBLE STRAIT AND IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN HELP ME IN WHAT WAY ASKED LESLIE
I DID NOT KNOW
THE GIRLS SHIPPED THEIR OARS AND BENT FORWARD
I WILL JUST SPEAK TO MISS FRERE
I KNOW YOU WON'T INJURE ME FOR AFTER ALL HOWEVER WICKED YOU ARE I AM YOUR OWN SISTER AND THE ONLY PERSON IN ALL THE WORLD WHO LOVES YOU
LIE BACK IN YOUR CHAIR DEAR MAMMY
WHEN ONE MAKES UP ONE'S MIND TO LEAD A REALLY USEFUL LIFE SURELY SMALL MATTERS SUCH AS LITTLE NERVOUSNESSES OUGHT NOT TO COUNT LESLIE GAZED HARD AT EILEEN AS IF SHE WOULD READ HER THROUGH
YOU REALLY THINK SO
LET ME LOOK AT YOU SAID BELLE
AND THEY ALL LOOKED UP TO HIM AND LOVED HIM AND HIS HEART WAS HAPPY
SHE STUDIED SHAKESPEARE NOT FOR HIS BEAUTY OF LANGUAGE BUT FOR HIS ARCHAISMS
HAD ANNIE GONE TO BED AND REALLY FORGOTTEN HER
I NEVER MEAN TO LET MY LOCKS GROW WHICH DRESSES WILL YOU WISH TO WEAR THIS EVENING YOUNG LADIES ASKED ESTHER WHO HAD GAPED IN ASTONISHMENT WHILE THE GIRLS WERE SPEAKING
WILL YOU TAKE IT YOU KNOW WHERE I AM GOING AND I HAVE GOT A CHANCE--WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE WENT UP TO HIM NOW RAISED HERSELF ON TIPTOE AND KISSED HIM ON HIS CHEEK
BUT THE OTHER TWO GIRLS PRESENTED AN APPEARANCE WHICH CAUSED POOR MRS CHETWYND TO SHUDDER
I MEAN THAT MY FOURTEEN SHILLINGS CAN NOW LAST ME NEARLY ANOTHER WEEK
I HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY A VERY WISE AND GOOD MOTHER TO REGARD A PLEASANT AND PRETTY FACE AS A BLESSING AS A TALENT SENT FROM GOD
BUT THAT PERHAPS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT LIKE THE RESPECTABILITY OF OUR DEAR OLD HALL TO BE DAMAGED BY HER THOROUGHLY DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE
SHE LIT THE LITTLE SPIRIT-LAMP PUT ON THE MILK TO BOIL AND PREPARED THE COCOA AS USUAL
WE THINK IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE USEFUL TO SAVE OUR MONEY
BUT EVIDENTLY THAT IS NOT TO BE MY LOT
YOU CANNOT ALLOW MR PARKER TO GO ON THINKING DAY AFTER DAY MONTH AFTER MONTH AND YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT I WAS REALLY GUILTY OF THE TERRIBLE SIN AND MEANNESS OF GOING INTO DEBT FOR SIXTY POUNDS AND THEN SENDING YOU TO HIM TO ASK HIM TO PAY MY DEBT
THERE DON'T GET PEPPERY
BUT AS I DO NOT SEE MY WAY TO DOING SO A SECOND TIME WE MUST GET IT IN SOME OTHER FASHION
IT IS TIME TO BE OFF I'M NOT COMING SAID ANNIE
I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY SOMETHING NOT TOO PLEASANT EITHER BUT WHICH OF COURSE YOU MUST BE IN A MANNER PREPARED FOR HERE MR PARKER TRIED TO FIX LESLIE WITH HIS EYES
BUT I HAVE HOPE AND SO HAS MY FRIEND ERICSON THAT WE SHALL PULL HER THROUGH
LISTEN TO ME LESLIE ANNIE SUDDENLY FELL ON HER KNEES AND TOOK ONE OF LESLIE'S HANDS IN HERS
THE IDEA OF CONFIDING IN MRS ACHESON NEVER OCCURRED TO HER
OH YES I'LL MANAGE
HE WOULD NOT TAKE A MONEY-FAVOR FROM ANYONE
YOU CAN GO RUPERT
OH DO TURN OFF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SHE SAID AGAIN
I WILL NEVER DO WHAT I HAVE DONE AGAIN IF ONLY YOU WILL TRUST AND FORGIVE ME THIS TIME
IT SEEMS TO ME ON THINKING THINGS OVER THAT ONLY ONE OF US CAN TAKE IT FOR MOTHER CAN'T DO WITHOUT BOTH OF US THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAID INTERRUPTED LLEWELLYN
THEY ARE NOT EVEN CLEAN
BUT TO HEAR RUPERT ABUSED WAS LIKE DRAGGING HER THROUGH FIRE
THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF HIS VERSE IS A QUIET PENSIVE REFLECTION
BUT DON'T YOU SEE WHATEVER MOTHER IS SHE IS NOT A HUMBUG ONLY WE DON'T WANT LETTIE TO TWIST HER ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER DO WE SAID EILEEN
SHE TURNED BACK RAN DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND KNOCKED AT ANNIE'S DOOR
WE WILL NOT GET ANY MORE
CHAPTER X--LLEWELLYN'S GIFT
HIS NAME IS RUPERT AND THAT WAS HE
I SAY IT HERE AND NOW MR PARKER WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD
NO WINE FOR ME
BUT I DO NOT THINK ANYONE REALLY LIKES HER
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT YOUR SISTER HAS DONE
YOU KNOW OF COURSE SHE SAID ABRUPTLY THAT I HAVE COME DOWN FROM ST WODE'S YES
I AM CERTAIN YOU ARE NOT WELL
SHE HAD TOLD LESLIE EVERYTHING
AND REALLY I DO THINK THAT ONE OUGHT TO TRY TO RETAIN A LITTLE STRENGTH OF MIND
I HEARD YOU TALKING TO NURSE SHE SAID
I NEVER KNEW HOME LIFE AND I CANNOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU TO-NIGHT NOR PERHAPS EVER
DO LET ME ALONE
OH IT DOES NOT LOWER YOU LESLIE
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY HERE YET DO YOU ASKED JANE TURNING TO EILEEN
I ALSO THINK WHAT BELLE SAID IS EXCELLENT
SHE STOOD THERE WITH THE SOFT NIGHT-BREEZE BLOWING UPON HER HOT FACE
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID BRINGING OUT HIS WORDS COLDLY THAT YOU HAVE ASKED LESLIE GILROY TO COME HERE AND PLEAD FOR YOU
OH I WOULD NOT SAY A WORD TO HURT YOU REPLIED JANE PENITENT ON THE SPOT
SHE DID NOT DENY ANYTHING THAT IS BECAUSE SHE WAS NOBLE
THESE GAVE A HOME LOOK TO THE ROOM AND SHE GLANCED AT THEM WITH SATISFACTION
YOU MUST WRITE TO OUR PRINCIPAL MISS LAUDERDALE ASKING HER TO GIVE YOU ALL PARTICULARS AS TO THE NECESSARY STEPS TO BE TAKEN FOR ADMISSION
HE LOOKED UP INTO HER KINDLY FIRM FACE
HER BRIGHT EYES AND LOVELY FACE HER WHOLE MANNER AND PLEASANT EXPRESSION MADE MANY OF THE GIRLS TURN AND GLANCE AT HER
ONE MUST GO ON WITH A THING WHETHER ONE IS SICK OR NOT OH I KNOW LEW DEAR OLD BOY AND I REALLY DON'T MEAN TO GRUMBLE
IT IS QUITE A WARM EVENING REPLIED EILEEN
I DO NOT CARE FOR CONVERSATION WITH MEN AS A RULE
LETITIA NOW ADVANCED
HE SANK BACK IN THE ARMCHAIR WHICH MRS GILROY HAD INVITED HIM TO TAKE POSSESSION OF AND PROCEEDED TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY
OF COURSE I'M NOT IN AUSTRALIA--I NEVER WENT THERE
BUT HE GAVE HER A LOOK FULL OF ELOQUENCE
GOOD GRACIOUS
GOOD GRACIOUS
BUT I TRUST NOTHING IS WRONG AT HOME NOTHING WHATEVER YOUNG LADY AND I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU REPLIED THAT INDIVIDUAL RUBBING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY AND YET WITH ANXIETY AT LESLIE
WAS SHE ONCE AGAIN PRAYING TO GOD
BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO BE MY ROOMFELLOW ARE YOU TO CONTROL MY ACTIONS
IT IS IN THE HALL
I AM GLAD YOU ARE MY ROOMFELLOW SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY
PEOPLE AS A RULE DO NOT ASK STARVING GIRLS TO PARTAKE OF THE COMFORTS OF THEIR LUXURIOUS HOMES
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL PERHAPS I HAVE A HEADACHE
THE WORLD QUITE OUT OF SIGHT WE DELVING IN THE RICHES OF THE PAST
I CAME TO WINGFIELD AND I SAW LESLIE AND SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
IF YOU DON'T I SHALL CALL OUT HER SUDDEN AND UNLOOKED-FOR APPEARANCE AND HER BRAVE WORDS STAGGERED THE MAN
THE THOUGHT OF THAT MONEY BECAME AN OPPRESSION AND A DREADFUL NIGHTMARE TO HER
HER DARK-BLUE SERGE DRESS LACKED FRESHNESS HER SAILOR HAT WAS DECIDEDLY THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND HER GLOVES HAD BEEN MENDED IN MANY PLACES
DON'T SHE SAID
HER HEART WAS BEATING QUICKLY
IN A MOMENT OR TWO SHE APPROACHED THE LITTLE DOOR FOUND THAT IT WAS STILL ON THE LATCH ENTERED AND UTTERED A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF
YOU ARE SURE TO HAVE A ROOM TO YOURSELF AFTER THIS TERM SAID JANE HERIOT
BUT SHE SLOWLY ENTERED NORTH HALL WENT UP TO HER OWN ROOM AND SAT DOWN BY THE OPEN WINDOW
SHE MUST NEVER ATTEMPT TO PLAY IN PUBLIC
I ONLY TRUST I SHAN'T GO MAD OVER LITERATURE IN THE WAY SHE DOES OVER MATHEMATICS ANNIE HAVING WORN OFF SOME OF HER SURPLUS EXCITEMENT HAD AGAIN SUNK DOWN BY HER DESK
I HOPE I SHALL BENEFIT BY IT
DO LET ME HOLD YOUR BABY FOR A LITTLE AS SHE SPOKE ALL THE OTHER PASSENGERS TURNED AND STARED AT HER
IT IS ONLY A MOMENT BACK THAT DEAR MARJORIE RAN INTO THE ROOM AND TOLD ME THAT EILEEN WAS BETTER THANK YOU REPLIED BELLE
I WILL TELL YOU AFTERWARDS
YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH ANNIE AND YOU HAVE CHEEK ENOUGH
THE ROSY CHEEK THE BRIGHT EYE WHICH SPARKLES WITH NO SOUL BENEATH THE POUTING LIPS FULL OF RUDE HEALTH DO NOT BELONG TO THE EARNEST STUDENT
THE LAMP BEAUTIFULLY TRIMMED AND BURNING CLEARLY STOOD ON THE CENTER TABLE THE RED CURTAINS WERE DRAWN ROUND THE WINDOWS
SPOTS OF GREASE HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE
WELL GO OFF NOW TO YOUR PRECIOUS ACHESONS AND YOUR COMFORTABLE HOME
BUT SOMEHOW THE MOTIVE HAS GONE
BEHIND THIS CURTAIN YOU WILL HANG YOUR SKIRTS
THE GIRLS FLEW DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER AND A MOMENT LATER WERE OUT WITH THE STARS LOOKING DOWN AT THEM AND THE MOON SHINING ON THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER
I THOUGHT SO HE SAID TO HIMSELF
IT IS KIND OF YOU TO LET ME HOLD YOUR LITTLE ONE
HER YOUNG ARMS WERE STRONG THE LITTLE ONE NESTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY AND THE MOTHER GAVE HER A GLANCE OF ADMIRATION
I WHO WISH TO CULTIVATE ALL THE SACRED VIRTUES TO STOOP TO A LIE
DO YOU KNOW MANY MEN
BY THE WAY EILEEN AND MARJORY I AM GOING TO THE BROAD NOW
IF ONE OF US IS TO GRIND FOR THE PRESENT OUGHT NOT I TO BE THE ONE
SHE SPRANG SUDDENLY TO HER FEET DANCED A MINUTE IN FRONT OF HER MOTHER AND THEN CLAPPED MARJORIE ON THE SHOULDER
LESLIE LOOKED AT THE CLERK
WHEN I ASK YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME I WISH TO HAVE YOU
THEY TALKED TO ONE ANOTHER
AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER YOU ASK SHE CONTINUED
I KNOW IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO SPEND ALL YOUR TIME IN STUDY
WHEN YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION HE WILL TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO INSURE YOUR COMMANDING AN EXCELLENT LIVING
YOU ARE SO NOBLE AND YET YOU ARE SO HARD
BUT I COULD NOT DO IT
YOU AT LEAST MY DEAR HAVE DERIVED BENEFIT FROM YOUR EDUCATION SHE SAID
AND YOU KNOW THIS MR CHARLES PARKER WELL SHE SAID TURNING TO LESLIE
GOOD-BY SHE SAID
YES CONTINUED BELLE RAISING HER SHORT-SIGHTED EYES AND GLANCING DOWN THE HALL TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF HER
BELIEVE IT OF YOU
YOU MAY AS WELL DRESS FOR DINNER NOW THAT YOU ARE ABOUT IT AND I WILL HAVE TEA SENT UP TO YOU TO YOUR ROOMS
NOW MRS CHETWYND DON'T FORGET TO WRITE
MY DEAR SAID MRS ACHESON EAGERLY MISS COLCHESTER HAS ARRIVED BELLE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLY
HE HURRIED OUT
BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH IN IT SAID LLEWELLYN QUIETLY
BUT DOUBTLESS THAT COULD BE EASILY MANAGED
SHE WAS WEARING A VERY CORRECT TRAVELING COSTUME OF DARK GRAY
SEE I WILL WRITE DOWN THE EXACT AMOUNT SHE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER SCRIBBLED THE SUM IN ROUGH WRITING AND THRUST IT INTO THE BOX
YOU COME HERE TO STUDY TO FORGET YOURSELVES IN THE GREAT RICHES OF THE PAST
AND HOW OLD MAY YOU BE SIXTEEN REPLIED LLEWELLYN
BUT WE MIGHT TRY
WHO KNOWS IN WHAT CLASS WE ARE COMING UP TO TOWN
THINK WHEN YOU ARE LAPPED IN LUXURY OF YOUR POOR STARVING BROTHER OH RUPERT YOU SURELY ARE NOT STARVING WELL I HAVE NOT HAD A DECENT MEAL FOR A WEEK
THAT WOODEN BOX THAT BELLE KEEPS FULL OF COINS YES THE SAME
THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT FOR ME TO GO AND LOOK FOR HER SHE SAID TO HERSELF
BUT NO THAT CAN'T BE THE CASE FOR WHEN I WENT DOWN TO WINGFIELD SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE STORY AND NEVER DENIED FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN THE LETTER
WHEN YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE CONVERSATION IS GETTING INTO DANGEROUS CHANNELS TURN IT MY DEAR CHILD
T
STAY IN THE ROOM YOURSELF
HOW IS IT YOU ARE HERE THIS MORNING I WILL TELL YOU
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHAT REALLY TROUBLES YOU I LONG TO CONFIDE EVERYTHING TO YOU REPLIED ANNIE BUT I DARE NOT
ON THE WHOLE SHE SAID I HAVE MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR
WITHOUT DOUBT ANNIE WAS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
YOU FELT HURT AT WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY
WE'LL HATE IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO RETURN TO YOUR GRAND COLLEGE IN THE AUTUMN LESLIE
I WILL WHISPER IT TO YOU
AND I RESPECT YOU ALL THE MORE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION JUST AT THAT INSTANT BELLE AND ANNIE ENTERED THE ROOM
TOLD GOOD STORIES ABOUT HIS EARLY LIFE IN AMERICA AND THEN ABOUT HIS EDUCATION IN LONDON
I DO PITY MRS ACHESON
I KNOW AUNT HELEN WON'T MIND MY ASKING YOU IN AND AS TO MARJORIE OH
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE BUT THAT YOU WOULD NOT STAY AND THAT EILEEN WAS LYING ON THE BED DEAD AND THAT YOU WOULD NOT LET ME TOUCH HER
AND WHO ARE YOU CONTINUED ANNIE COLCHESTER GAZING IN A SORT OF VACANT WAY AT HER ROOMFELLOW
BUT I CANNOT CANNOT TALK IT OVER WITH YOU JUST THEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND MR PARKER HIMSELF CAME IN
WHAT CAN IT SIGNIFY TO YOU WHETHER MR PARKER THINKS BADLY OF YOU OR NOT
I HAD HOPED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE WILL OF PROVIDENCE TO ALLOW A CONGENIAL SPIRIT TO SHARE THIS ROOM WITH ME
BUT I DON'T THINK I SHALL TAKE HONORS
THEY TOOK UP THEIR WORK FOR NEVER FOR A MOMENT IN THIS FAMILY WAS IDLENESS ALLOWED AND SAT DOWN NEAR THE LAMP
WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THEM I WANT YOU TO PUT A COUPLE OF THEM INTO MY CARE
MY COINS
ANNIE WAS ALREADY SEATED AT HER DESK AND BENDING OVER HER ENDLESS PROBLEMS
BUT TO LIVE WITH HER--OH IT WOULD BE A REAL TRIAL AND I WONDER WHAT MISS GILROY WILL DO WHEN THE OTHER GIRLS CALL ON HER SAID JANE
AND JUST ABOUT THEN THEY BEGAN TO CHANGE
I WAS ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHEN WE WERE ALONE
I DON'T THINK I SHALL EVER BE GOOD AGAIN SAID POOR LESLIE
I CANNOT BEAR THE WAY LETTIE GOES ON ABOUT HER
PLENTY OF CHARACTER PLENTY OF GO PLENTY OF SPIRIT NOTHING MEAN OR UNDERHAND ABOUT ONE OF THEM
BUT IT IN THE CHARACTER-DRAWING OF THE PRINCIPALS THAT THE AUTHOR'S STRENGTH LIES
HOW PLEASANT EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WHEN DID YOU SAY THE DEBATE WOULD BEGIN ASKED EILEEN
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR LESLIE GILROY WENT ACROSS TO BELLE ACHESON'S ROOM
IS IT HOT
I CONSIDER THAT WE ARE NOW SETTLED IN COLLEGE AND THAT OUR REAL LIFE BEGINS TO-MORROW SAID LESLIE
PON MY WORD YOU'RE A WELL-GROWN CHAP
THEY ARE QUEER OBSTINATE OUT-OF-THE-WAY GIRLS
WHAT POSSIBLE HARM CAN I DO HER
IT IS TRUE I HAVE HER LETTER
I MEAN THE GIRLS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND WILL LEAVE OTHER MATTERS TO PROVIDENCE TAKING STEPS MEANWHILE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR REAL OBJECT MURMURED MRS ACHESON UNDER HER BREATH
THERE IS A FELLOW TO WHOM I OWE TWENTY POUNDS AND IF I DON'T GET IT I'LL BE LOCKED UP
IF SO I WILL ASK JANE HERIOT TO TAKE ME IN UNTIL THE MORNING I AM SURE ANNIE COLCHESTER HAS NOT GONE TO BED REPLIED SUSAN
HE SCARCELY SPEAKS TO ME NOW IF WE MEET
YOU LOOK MISS GILROY AS IF YOU INTENDED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME LESLIE DID NOT REPLY EXCEPT WITH HER EYES WHICH WERE SMILING
ANNIE WAS TALKING ALOUD WITH GREAT FORCE
COME LESLIE WILL YOU DO THIS FOR ME BUT DO YOU QUITE REALIZE WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID LESLIE
HER BROWN EYES GAZED FULL INTO MRS CHETWYND'S AGITATED FACE
SHE CLASPED HER OWN STRONG ARMS ROUND HER LAID THE TIRED FLUSHED FACE AGAINST HER BREAST PUSHED BACK THE HAIR WITH ONE OF HER HANDS AND BEGAN GENTLY TO STROKE THE HOT CHEEK
BUT THAT WAS A TRIFLING MATTER TO LESLIE WHO NOW THAT THINGS WERE THOROUGHLY ARRANGED WISHED TO START ON HER NEW CAREER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY
BUT HE COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT HE FELT NEARLY AS PUZZLED AS EVER
BUT SHE DISAPPOINTS ME TERRIBLY IN HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS BELLE
BUT I WILL DO MY DUTY
HER FOREHEAD WAS HIGH HER COMPLEXION SALLOW HER EYES SHORT-SIGHTED AND SMALL
I NEVER YET KNEW THE MAN WHO WANTED TO LOOK AT ME A SECOND TIME
I SAW YOU LEAVE YOUR ROOM ON THE WAY TO EAST HALL THIS EVENING AND A MOMENT AFTERWARDS SHE CAME OUT AND RAN DOWN THE BACK-STAIRS
LESLIE HASTILY PROCEEDED AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD THIS REMARK
THE N
IN THAT CASE YOU WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MISS FRERE
NO MORE SPEAKING IN HALL SAID THE VOICE OF THE INDIGNANT CHAIRWOMAN
THE OTHER GIRLS HAD PROMISED TO SING OUT TO HER FROM THE GRAVEL SWEEP BELOW WHEN THEY WERE READY
DON'T TOUCH ME SAID MARJORIE
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I HAVE COME ABOUT
HOW COULD SHE TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT RUINING ME
CHAPTER VII--THE FATE OF THE GIRLS
AND WITH THE CHEERFUL FIRES BURNING IN THE SMALL GRATES AND THE SWEET AIR COMING IN FROM THE SQUARE GARDEN NO ROOMS COULD LOOK MORE TEMPTING
ABSOLUTELY RUINED FOR LIFE BUT I SHOULD NOT BE FEELING AS BITTER AS I NOW DO YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MISERABLE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE CARED TO LIVE SAID ANNIE WITH CONVICTION
I DID WRITE THAT LETTER
PRESENTLY SHE UTTERED A SHORT SHARP SIGH
AND I THINK SHE HAS BEEN CRYING--SHE SIGHS SO HEAVILY IN HER SLEEP
SHE WISHED SHE HAD NOT BEEN WITH BELLE WHEN SHE COUNTED HER MONEY
BUT YOU ARE AS MUM AND QUIET AS IF YOU HAD NOT HAD A GOOD TIME AT ALL WHEREAS OF COURSE YOU HAVE HAD THE VERY BEST TIME A GIRL COULD HAVE
OH I DON'T MEAN TO FLATTER
THIS IS A WONDERFUL THING FOR ME SAID ANNIE AS SHE STOOD UP
I HAVE COME HERE TO-NIGHT MR COLCHESTER TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE THE ONE MOST TO BLAME
NOW THEN LET US SPEAK
IT HAD A NOTE OF SYMPATHY IN IT TOO WHICH RANG THROUGH THE OLD ROOM
BE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE
HOW FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY I'LL BE
REMEMBERING THIS ANNIE ONE DAY TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE TERM RAISED HER EYES FROM HER BOOKS AND FIXED THEM ON LESLIE
SHE WAS ALWAYS UNEARTHLY AND NOW SHE IS GOING AWAY
BUT THERE IS NO USE IN WORRYING HER NOW TIRED OUT LESLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
HE WAS ABSENT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES
NOT A BIT OF IT
INSTEAD OF COMING TO ME YOURSELF OR EVEN WRITING TO ME--INSTEAD OF GIVING ME YOUR FULL CONFIDENCE AND FEELING SURE THAT I AS YOUR FATHER'S OLD FRIEND WOULD NOT BE TOO HARD ON YOU--YOU HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO DO THAT--YOU SENT A STRANGER TO ME I CANNOT UNDERSTAND SAID POOR LESLIE
THEY ARE GOING TO CALL ON ME MOST LIKELY THIS EVENING
IT SO HAPPENED THEREFORE THAT LETITIA EILEEN MARJORIE AND LESLIE GILROY ALL FOUND THEMSELVES ON A CERTAIN AFTERNOON IN THE SAME CAB DRIVING TO ST WODE'S FROM THE RAILWAY STATION A MILE AND A HALF DISTANT
SHE WOULD ENJOY IT WHILE SHE COULD
OH WHAT DOES A LITTLE UNKINDNESS MATTER SAID ANNIE
YOU RESEMBLE THAT TERRIBLE YOUNG PERSON LETITIA CHETWYND
I HAVE JUST EXAMINED THE FRONTAL DEVELOPMENTS OF MARJORIE'S AND EILEEN'S HEADS SHE SAID SPEAKING IN A LOUD RAPID VOICE AND GLANCING IN THE DIRECTION WHERE MRS CHETWYND AND MRS ACHESON WERE SEATED TOGETHER ON A SOFA
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN FRIVOLS WILL BE EXTERMINATED FOREVER WHEN THE DRONES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF THINGS MUST DIE OUT
HE SENT IN HIS CARD AND BEGGED TO SEE ME
BELIEVE ME I HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
NOW I AM THE MOST MISERABLE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE IS ABOUT YOU LESLIE AND ABOUT MARJORIE
I AM COLLECTING COINS IT WAS PERFECTLY TRUE WASN'T IT
OH I AM ACQUAINTED WITH THE GHASTLY ROUND
WHY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXPELLED RUINED
LESLIE I COULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT IT OF YOU I AM NOT LOOKING BACK BELLE
AM I SITTING HERE TO TALK OF THE GIRLS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TASTE CRIED BELLE
I MUST JUST BEAR MY BURDEN ALONE
THERE IS THE WORKHOUSE FOR SUCH AS THEM
CANNOT YOU TRY TO UNDERSTAND
WE COMMEND IT FOR ITS WORKMANSHIP--FOR ITS SMOOTHNESS ITS SENSIBLE FANCIES AND FOR ITS GENERAL CHARM ZELDA DAMERON
CHAPTER XXXIII CONFESSION
MISS LAUDERDALE WAS CONSIDERABLY ANNOYED AT YOUR NOT ATTENDING THE MEETING
EVEN IN MY DARKEST HOUR I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT WELL AT LEAST THERE IS ANNIE NOW MY HOUR OF GLOOM HAS TRULY ARRIVED MY BLACK HOUR COME AND I AM ONLY ABLE TO SAY ANNIE HAS DESERTED ME NO ANSWERED ANNIE I HAVE NOT REALLY DESERTED YOU
THEY ARE SOME OF THE NICEST PEOPLE IN WINGFIELD AND THEY HAVE SUCH DELIGHTFUL SUNDAY EVENINGS
CHAPTER XXIV--THE TWINS
I WAS SO TERRIBLY THIRSTY ANNIE DRAINED THE GLASS OFF AND RETURNED IT TO HER COMPANION
YOU'VE GOT ME OUT OF MORE THAN ONE SCRAPE AND YOU'LL GET ME OUT OF THIS ONE
I AGREE WITH YOU
DON'T BE A GOOSE SAID MARJORIE
THINK OF THAT
MR PARKER--HE WAS MY FATHER'S GREAT FRIEND
IF I TOLD WHAT ANNIE HAS REALLY DONE IT MIGHT GET HER INTO SUCH FEARFUL TROUBLE THAT SHE WOULD BE RUINED
LESLIE HE SAID
I WAS WONDERING LAST NIGHT WHAT MY MISSION IN THIS PLACE COULD BE
WHY SHOULD PEOPLE WASTE TIME IN FLUFFING AND CRIMPING THEIR HAIR
NOW RUN LETTIE
THE PAINT ON THE DOORS AND ROUND THE WAINSCOT WAS CREAMY WHITE
SHE HAS HEARD THAT YOU WANT A SECRETARY MR PARKER RAISED HIS BROWS AND AN OMINOUS EXCLAMATION DROPPED FROM HIS LIPS
SHE WON'T MAKE HERSELF THE LEAST BIT AGREEABLE
I DIDN'T GUESS AT THE TIME HOW MUCH SHE WOULD SUFFER AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO HER
THEY HAD CLEAR GOOD COMPLEXIONS
YOU ARE NOT DEAD TIRED
BUT LESLIE WAS A HEALTHY GIRL
IF LETITIA WERE MY DAUGHTER IT WOULD BE PLAIN SAILING BUT AS IT IS I AM AT MY WITS END BY AND BY MRS CHETWYND WENT UPSTAIRS
MOST UNNECESSARY IN MY OPINION
THE GIRLS LEFT THE ROOM AND ONLY LETITIA REMAINED BEHIND
SHALL I INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS MAPLE NOW OR WILL YOU WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING DO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING SAID JANE
AN EXCELLENT PURPOSE
RUPERT SCOWLING AT ANNIE MADE A RUSH TO THE WINDOW PUT HIS FOOT OVER THE LEDGE AND DISAPPEARED
WE LOOKED FORWARD SO MUCH TO THE LONG VACATION
NOW A CARPET TO THE FLOOR AN EASY-CHAIR TO LOUNGE IN CURTAINS TO THE WINDOWS TO KEEP OUT THE RACKING HEAT OF THE MIDDAY SUN--ALL THESE THINGS WOULD BE SINS IN A PERSON LIKE ME
ALWAYS NOW THERE WOULD BE ONE PERSON WHO WOULD THINK OF HER AS A GIRL CAPABLE OF ANY MEANNESS ANY SMALLNESS ANY DECEIT
IS THIS YOUR FIRST TERM SHE ADDED AS SHE SEATED HERSELF IN THE CAB
NOW YOU LESLIE REALLY SOOTHE ME
SHE WAS TIRED TOO
SHE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO TAKE THE FEVER
ON THE VERY EVENING WHEN I SAW RUPERT AND FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT HIS TROUBLE LESLIE TALKED ABOUT YOU
SHE GLANCED AT MARJORIE AND MARJORIE NODDED
I HAVE A FIT OF THE BLUES THAT'S ALL WELL AND I HAVE A FIT OF THE CHEERFULS SAID MRS GILROY
SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HALL
YOU PROMISE LESLIE THAT YOU WILL PLEAD VERY VERY HARD I WILL DO MY BEST ANSWERED LESLIE
AND WHEN DID YOU EAT ANYTHING LAST
I FORGOT TO SEND MY SHIRTS TO THE WASH ON MONDAY AND I HAVE NOT ONE FIT TO BE SEEN THEN IT SERVES YOU RIGHT IF YOU ARE HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE CRIED KITTY
SHE KNOWS THAT IF SHE IS UNTIDY I AM ABSOLUTELY THE REVERSE SOON AFTERWARDS SHE FELL ASLEEP AGAIN AND WHEN SHE DID AWAKE SAW TO HER ASTONISHMENT THAT THE SUN WAS POURING INTO THE ROOM AND THAT ANNIE COLCHESTER WAS ALREADY UP AND NEATLY DRESSED
OH NOW I CAN BREATHE NOW I CAN SLEEP SHE SAID
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT I HAVE DONE TO DESERVE SUCH GIRLS AS YOU TWO
I AM ONE OF THE POOR AND UNLUCKY
STAND UP ANNIE AND SPEAK THIS MOMENT BUT ANNIE WAS PAST THIS HER HEAD WAS BURIED IN HER HANDS AND SOBS SHOOK HER FRAME
I AM SORRY
THEN SHE CONTINUED THE SMILES WHICH SHE COULD NOT SUPPRESS NOW VISITING HER EYES IS NOT THE WHOLE SCHEME DELIGHTFUL
IT WAS FEARFUL TO THINK THAT SUCH A GIRL WAS COMING TO PAY A VISIT TO MARJORIE AND EILEEN AT THIS IMPORTANT CRISIS IN THEIR LIVES
IT IS MOST DRAMATIC CONTAINING SOME TREMENDOUS PICTURES OF THE DARING OF THE MEN WHO ARE TRYING TO REACH THE POLE BUT IT IS AT THE SAME TIME ESSENTIALLY A WOMAN'S BOOK AND THE STORY WORKS ITSELF OUT IN THE SOLUTION OF A DIFFICULTY THAT IS CONTINUALLY PRESENTED IN REAL LIFE--THE WIFE'S ATTITUDE IN RELATION TO HER HUSBAND WHEN BOTH HAVE WELL-DEFINED CAREERS
THE DAY'S WORK BEGAN AND CONTINUED
I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES NEVERTHELESS I WILL STATE THE POSITION QUITE PLAINLY
THE DAYDREAMS WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN SEEN IN THOSE FLAMES WERE RECEDING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY
BUT I HAVE MADE THE MOST OF MY OPPORTUNITIES
WELL EILEEN SHE BEGAN--SHE SHOOK HER FINGER IN THE FACE OF THE BRIGHT TALL GIRL AS SHE SPOKE--"IF YOU BEGIN THAT SORT OF THING JUST ON THE VERY DAY WHEN YOU HAVE LEFT SCHOOL IF YOU WILL INSIST ON WEARING THOSE DISGRACEFULLY SHABBY CLOTHES GOING THIRD-CLASS AND TAKING US WITH YOU WHEN YOUR MOTHER SENDS US MONEY TO TRAVEL FIRST AND FINALLY ADOPTING STRANGE BABIES WHO HAPPEN TO BE TRAVELING IN THE SAME CARRIAGE YOU WILL CERTAINLY BREAK AUNT HELEN'S HEART EILEEN SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
SHE HAD SCARCELY ANY TASTE FOR MUSIC AND SHE PLAYED SEVERAL WRONG NOTES
CHAPTER XV--BELLE'S ROOM AT ST
SHE VISITS ME IN MY ROOM AND INSISTS UPON TALKING HER FRIVOLOUS NONSENSE UNTIL MY HEAD ACHES
IT IS NOT LIKE HER
YOU NEED NOT COME IN SHE SAID TO ANNIE
I HAVE TAKEN THE CHECK AND HAVE ACCEPTED THE OFFER
I CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS AND I AM NOT PREPARED TO LISTEN
CERTAINLY YOU MAY
HE CAME IN LOOKING BRISK SMART AND HANDSOME
SHE SAID YOU WERE TERRIBLY CHANGED TO HER
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR HE SAID AGAIN
YOU SEEM TO KNOW SOMETHING
THERE'S A WAY OUT OF THIS SOMEHOW AND I BELIEVE THE POOR GIRL IS NOTHING BUT A DUPE
LESLIE MADE NO REPLY
THIS IS QUITE SPLENDID SHE SAID
SHE IS VERY BUSY AND HAS LITTLE TIME TO THINK
SIR I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER REASON
ON THEIR WAY HOME BELLE WENT FOR A MOMENT INTO A STATIONER'S
DID NOT YOU HEAR ME SAY SO BUT WHY
OH DEAR
BUT I CONFESS IT WILL BE SOMETHING OF A HANDFUL TAKING THREE INTO SOCIETY AT THE SAME TIME OH YOU SURELY DON'T MEAN TO INTRODUCE THE WHOLE THREE THE SAME SEASON SAID MRS ACHESON
I MEAN I AM SORRY ON YOUR ACCOUNT
TO-MORROW I SHALL NOT BE HOME UNTIL VERY LATE
BUT HER HEART SANK
ENDLESS MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT UPON ST WODE'S COLLEGE WHICH NOW RANKED AS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT COLLEGES FOR WOMEN IN THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND
I ASSURE YOU I AM ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK OH NO YOU ARE NOT YOUNG LADY
I WANT TO ACQUIRE--WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
IS NOT THAT SO SAID ALICE SMART
A NICE SISTER YOU ARE
LESLIE REACHED HER OWN DOOR
SHE WILL RETURN BY THE LAST TRAIN THIS EVENING
HE PURSED UP HIS LIPS AND UTTERED A LONG WHISTLE
THE CEILING OF THE LITTLE ROOM WAS LOW AND THE FURNITURE ALTHOUGH EXQUISITELY CLEAN AND ORDERLY WAS SHABBY
I DO WISH LESLIE GILROY YOU WOULD NOT WORRY ME LESLIE STARTED BACK LOOKING HURT AND DISMAYED
SHE THOUGHT OF HER MOTHER AT HOME OF LLEWELLYN AND OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN
LESLIE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT
I CAN'T BEAR ANYONE TO TOUCH ME NOW
WHAT A WIDE WIDE GULF LIES BETWEEN US YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN WHEN YOU SAY THAT I AM ONE OF THE RICH ONES SAID LESLIE
YOU LOOK QUITE ILL CHILD
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED BOTH DEAF AND DUMB AND I CAN DO NOTHING WITH HER SHE ANSWERED
SO I SENT NOTES AND GOLD
A GIRL WHO CAN GO INTO DEBT ONCE AND CONCEAL IT FROM HER FRIENDS AND SEND ANOTHER GIRL MR PARKER YOU BREAK MY HEART AGAIN I REPEAT I AM SORRY BUT I MUST HAVE MY SAY
IF I DON'T I SHALL DIE AND YOU ARE CERTAIN TO SUCCEED SAID LESLIE IN A TONE OF SYMPATHY
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME SHE SAID
DO I SEE FRESHERS HERE
BUT THEY SEEM NICE GIRLS AND HAVE HANDSOME FACES YES I AM SURE THEY ARE CHARMING AND ALSO OUT OF THE COMMON
WAS SHE REALLY ONLY LOOKING FOR ONE OF HER OWN PAPERS IN LESLIE'S DESK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
YOU HAD BETTER GO AWAY BOTH OF YOU GIRLS AND CONSULT--THERE IS SOMETHING AT THE BACK OF THIS
WHEN A MAN IS LUCKY THERE HE IS VERY LUCKY
IN ALL PROBABILITY YOU WILL BE VERY SHORT-SIGHTED WHEN YOU COME TO COLLEGE
WE WERE SO ANXIOUS TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS GILROY AND I AM AFRAID YOU ARE FRIGHTENING HER
MR PARKER PRECEDED HER AND FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR
HE FEELS SO VERY FULL OF SYMPATHY FOR YOU ANNIE ANNIE GOT UP
THINK WHAT IT MUST MEAN TO ME
THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH THEY SAT WAS MORE OR LESS CROWDED WITH COUNTRY PEOPLE WHO CARRIED BASKETS BABIES FEEDING-BOTTLES AND ALL SORTS OF PARCELS
HE HAD A BRONZED CHEEK AND A KEEN DARK EYE
MRS CHETWYND HESITATED A MOMENT BEFORE SHE WENT INTO LETITIA'S ROOM
DO YOU KNOW SHE SAID THAT I AM QUITE GLAD TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING YOU BY YOURSELF
ABSORB YOURSELF IN WORK
JUST TAKE THE NEEDLES OUT AND UNRAVEL A FEW ROWS THEN PUT THE NEEDLES IN AGAIN AND I'LL BE READY TO GIVE YOU A LESSON BEFORE BEDTIME
SHE SAT FEELING SHY AND UNCOMFORTABLE SCARCELY OPENING HER LIPS WHILE RUPERT CARRIED THE CONVERSATION HIS OWN WAY
WHAT DID THAT LETTER MEAN THE SLEEPER MOANED HEAVILY
LESLIE RETURNED HER GAZE WITH ONE FRANK AND SYMPATHETIC
FOR SHAME MUTTERED OTHERS
I WILL TELL YOU BOTH ABOUT THE COLLEGE IF YOU REALLY WISH TO LEARN SHE CONTINUED
THEY HAVE CHANGED TRULY
I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU IN A MOMENT WHETHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE VIRGIL MARJORIE SUBMITTED TO THIS TEST WITH EXEMPLARY PATIENCE
I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE NO END OF RATTLING GOOD STORIES TO TELL US
I DON'T PRETEND ALL THE SAME THAT IT'S NOT BEEN NO END OF A TUSSLE HE SAID
THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER--NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
HE IS I PRESUME AT ONE OF THE HOTELS
AYE THE GIRL WAS BONNY
NOW TO TURN TO THE OTHERS
WHAT A PITY I DID NOT KNOW AND I WOULD HAVE ASKED HIM TO SHARE OUR DINNER IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO SEE HIM AT ALL SAID ANNIE WHO FELT MORE WRETCHED EACH MOMENT
A STORY WHICH HAS FOR A HEROINE A GIRL DECIDEDLY OUT OF THE ORDINARY RUN OF FICTION
AND DO YOU KNOW MR COLCHESTER THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR APPOINTMENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE
BY THE WAY YOU LOOK RATHER BAD YOURSELF PLEASE DON'T SPEAK ABOUT ME
YOU CAN USE IT OR NOT AS YOU PLEASE
WHEN SHE REACHED HER ROOM THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS ON AND ANNIE WAS STANDING NEAR HER WINDOW
DR ERICSON GOT OUT OF HIS AND AN ELDERLY BENEVOLENT-LOOKING MAN OUT OF THE OTHER
I WAS OBLIGED TO TELL HER THE TRUTH AND SHE RESOLVED TO SCREEN ME AND TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES PON MY WORD
STEAK AND STOUT AND BOILED APPLE PUDDING
BUT I DID NOT THINK MY VERY MODERATE GIFT WORTH CULTIVATING REPLIED EILEEN YAWNING SLIGHTLY AS SHE SPOKE
THE CARPET ON EACH FLOOR WAS A SQUARE OF RICH TURKEY
I DO NOT FEEL NEARLY SO UNHAPPY NOW
SHE FELT HERSELF A HYPOCRITE AND COULD SCARCELY STAND MRS ACHESON'S KIND AND AFFECTIONATE REMARKS
BUT THEN HER OWN CORRESPONDENCE ABSORBED HER AND SHE DID NOT NOTICE WHEN ELEVEN AND EVEN TWELVE STRUCK
A PRETTY LITTLE TEA-SERVICE A BRASS KETTLE AND A TEA-TABLE WHICH COULD FOLD UP AND BE PUT OUT OF THE WAY WHEN NOT NEEDED FOR USE WERE ALSO SECURED
BUT THERE HE ADDED CLENCHING ONE OF HIS STRONG HANDS I DID NOT MEAN TO LET IT OUT TO YOU AND I AM QUITE RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T FEEL A BIT MISERABLE LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM AND LLEWELLYN WAS ALONE
HOW CAN YOU DARE WILL YOU GIVE THE MESSAGE
ANNIE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER
THREE GIRLS WERE TRAVELING IN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE TO KING'S CROSS
AT THE END OF THAT INTERVIEW HE SAW THAT IF HE WAS TO GET ANYTHING OUT OF THE ACHESONS HE MUST DO IT IN HIS OWN WAY
ALL TOO SOON SHE HEARD JUST WHAT SHE EXPECTED TO HEAR--STEPS IN THE GARDEN OUTSIDE
I KNOW I AM DOING IT WRONG I SHOULD THINK YOU ARE YOU OLD GOOSE SAID KITTY
IT WAS THE MARKED AND WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE ON HER OPEN BROW THE SPEAKING THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION IN HER EYES THE FIRM PROUD OUTLINE OF HER BEAUTIFUL LIPS
YOU MAY AS WELL SAY THAT THE MATTER IS PRACTICALLY SETTLED AND THAT THERE IS NO USE IN ANY OF THEM WAITING THE CLERK WITHDREW AND MR PARKER BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE LENGTH OF HIS ROOM
I HAVE LIVED THROUGH SUCH AWFUL AGONY--MISERY BEYOND WORDS WAS MINE
GILROY AND I WERE LADS TOGETHER IN THE SAME SCHOOL
I STAYED AT HOME TO MOPE TO MOPE
BUT IF ANNIE TAKES HONORS WHICH SHE IS VERY LIKELY TO DO SHE WILL BE LEAVING ST WODE'S AND THEN THE GOVERNORS WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER ROOM THE DINNER PROCEEDED
CHAPTER XXI WHAT IS UP
SHE THREW HERSELF TRAGICALLY BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE HARD-BOTTOMED CHAIRS
BECAUSE RUPERT HIMSELF HAS OPENED MY EYES
NOW SIT DOWN NEAR ME AND TELL ME WHAT YOUR INCLINATIONS ARE
IT IS QUITE TOO INTERESTING AND TOO--TOO WONDERFUL
IF I HAD TAKEN A FIRST-CLASS AT MY FINAL I COULD HAVE GOT A GOOD SITUATION AS A TEACHER ALTHOUGH I HATE TEACHING FOR I AM TOO IMPATIENT AND TOO DREAMY
NOW COME GIRLS AND LEAVE HER IN PEACE BELLE APPROACHED HER ATTIC WINDOW
A COLLEGE GIRL OUGHT TO HAVE WIDER SYMPATHIES AND TO BE LESS SELFISH ALL ROUND THAN A GIRL WHO KNOWS ONLY THE ORDINARY HOME LIFE
THE NAME IS A GREAT DEAL TOO LONG FOR EVERYDAY USE
YOU NEED NOT REPROACH YOURSELF IN THE VERY LEAST
NOT YET ANYHOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF
ANNIE'S GROANS GREW LESS HER EYES CLOSED AND IN HALF AN HOUR SHE WAS ASLEEP
GIVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND PLEASE ANNIE THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE IN IDLE CONVERSATION WITH HIM
IT WILL SOON BE TIME TO GO DOWN TO HALL TO THE DEBATE
YOU ARE UNDER MY CARE NOW AND MUST SUBMIT TO MY DIRECTIONS SHE BROUGHT A GLASS OF ICE-COLD WATER AND HELD IT TO ANNIE'S LIPS
I CAN EASILY GET YOU A DAY'S TICKET FOR THE READING ROOM SHE SAID
WHEN IT WAS OVER FOLDING-DOORS WERE THROWN BACK AND ALL THE STUDENTS WERE INVITED INTO THE LARGE SALOON WHICH MISS LAUDERDALE RESERVED FOR VERY RARE AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS
YES YES
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER SAID LESLIE AS SHE ENTERED
HE MUST BE MY SPECIAL CHARGE TO-DAY KITTY GIVE ME THOSE SANDWICHES
IF YOU ARE WISE MY DEAR EMILY YOU WILL TRY TO INTRODUCE BELLE
DO YOU KNOW HER WE ALL KNOW HER MORE OR LESS
DON'T ASK ME AT THE PRESENT MOMENT MOTHER
SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD BEEN YOUR GREATEST FRIEND AND THAT YOU HAD MADE A SORT OF PROMISE TO HELP HIS CHILDREN
YOU THOUGHT OF COURSE THE OLD MAN WOULD PAY UP
I PLEAD BECAUSE I AM MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER AND BECAUSE ONCE YOU WERE FOND OF ME AND GOOD TO ME
YOU WILL UPSET US ALL AND AS TO MOTHER LISTEN LEW I CANNOT GIVE YOU ANY REASON
I REPRESENTED THAT IT WOULD BE A SAVING
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN BED AND TO HAVE TAKEN HER COCOA AN HOUR AGO
I HAVE THEREFORE A CAMP-BED IN ONE CORNER A PARTICULARLY NARROW ONE
THE COLLEGE IS OVERFULL AT PRESENT AND YET NO GIRLS WISH TO USE THE ATTICS
YOU ARE FASHIONABLE
IF SO DON'T FORGET THAT WE WERE CHUMS THAT WE WERE LADS TOGETHER AND IF YOU CAN DO A KINDNESS TO ME OR MINE DO IT
BUT I AM DIFFERENT
OH LOVELY LOVELY BEWITCHING INTOXICATING
BUT NEVER MIND NEVER MIND
MARJORIE FOLLOWED SUIT AND LETITIA ENTERED LAST IN A DAINTY AND PRETTY MANNER
I THINK SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL IN HER
I AM TO QUIET MYSELF TO CRUSH BACK MY MISERY MY DESPAIR
I SHALL BE VERY PLEASED INDEED TO SEE HIM HERE AGAIN
I AM ALL ALONE FOR MOTHER AND ALL THE CHILDREN ARE ON THE RIVER AND YOU YOU DEAR FAITHFUL SOUL HAVE STAYED AT HOME TO GO ON WITH YOUR LITERARY STUDIES EXCLAIMED BELLE HER EYES GLEAMING
SHE WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT AND STEPPED ON TO THE LANDING
MRS ACHESON AND BELLE SAT UP A LITTLE LONGER THEN THEY ALSO RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
NOW I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY ROOM
BUT I MUST FRANKLY ADMIT THAT I SHALL HAVE VERY LITTLE INFLUENCE I ONLY WISH PROVIDENCE HAD MADE YOU ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
SHE FELT FULL OF THE STRANGEST APPREHENSION
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HE RESPECTS HER LESLIE I SHOULD THINK SO SAID LESLIE
WE CANNOT DRAG HER AWAY
SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU WERE WHEN FIRST I MET YOU AT ST WODE'S NEVER MIND ABOUT ME ANSWERED LESLIE
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS BITTERLY HARD FOR ME TO HAVE TO PLEAD WITH YOU
IF YOU WILL JUST GIVE ME HIS ADDRESS I WILL SEND HIM A LINE ASKING HIM TO DINE WITH US THIS EVENING
I SEE IT AT LAST
MOTHER HAVE YOU GOT MY SMALL VIRGIL IN YOUR BAG
THE POEM A STANZA OF WHICH I WILL RECITE IS CALLED MUSOPHILUS IT IS ADDRESSED TO PHILOCOSLUS A LOVER OF THE WORLD
THE CHARACTERS ARE SUPERBLY DRAWN
I WAS DOWN BY THE RIVER REPLIED LESLIE COLDLY
THE MINDS OF THE REAL STUDENTS MUST BE LEFT FREE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS--THE INTRICACIES OF VIRGIL THE GREAT MASTERPIECES OF HOMER DANTE IN HIS MAGNIFICENT ORIGINAL BELLE HAD NOW FORGOTTEN HER AUDITORS
NOW THAT I HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SAME HALL BELLE SHIVERED
IS HE TO GO OFF SCOT-FREE FOR ANNIE'S SAKE YES
YOU CAN ESCAPE
BY THE WAY ARE YOU?--OH YES
YOU KNOW I GO UP AGAIN NEXT WEEK AND CAN THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
WOULD YOU CARE FOR A FIRE
BUT I WON'T GIVE WAY TO IT SHE SAID TO HERSELF
LET ME BE HAPPY WHILE I AM HERE AND DON'T BE--OH DON'T BE TOO KIND WHAT DOES THE POOR CHILD MEAN THOUGHT MRS ACHESON
NOW LET US COUNT THE CANVAS BAGS WERE OPENED AND THEY DID COUNT OR RATHER BELLE DID
WHAT'S YOUR NAME YOUNG SIR LLEWELLYN REPLIED THE BOY
I DISTRUSTED HER AND YOU ALLOWED HER TO SCREEN YOU I DID FOR RUPERT'S SAKE
I AM QUITE SURE IT IS BECAUSE SHE IS SO UNHAPPY SHE THOUGHT
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WAS SETTING THE SEAL TO HER DEGRADATION
THE OTHER GIRLS CAME UP AND BELLE WAS DULY PRESENTED TO LESLIE GILROY
FOR I SHAN'T ADMIT YOU SAID BELLE
LETTIE WAS WRITING LETTERS TO ANXIOUS FRIENDS
BUT UNDERSTAND THIS LESLIE I'LL HAVE NO MORE FOOLING
AND THEY ARE BOTH ON SUCH A LARGE SCALE
THERE IS NEVER ANY SAYING
HAVING DECLINED SO MUCH IS THERE ANYTHING YOU AGREE TO OH YES LOTS MOTHER NOW YOU ARE BECOMING REASONABLE AND WE CAN TALK
WRAPPED IN THE MISERY OF THESE THOUGHTS LESLIE DID NOT NOTICE ANNIE UNTIL SHE CAME BACK AND TOUCHED HER ON THE ARM
UNTIL IT WAS MENDED WELL I AM LIKE THAT WATCH
BUT I DON'T THINK I AM MUCH OF A COWARD AND CAN SOON LEARN SHE ADDED
MORE FIRMLY EACH MOMENT WAS SHE MAKING UP HER MIND
YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN IN CONSIDERING YOURSELF PLAIN
SHE STOOD THERE BEHIND THE SHELTER OF THE CURTAINS AND LOOKED OUT
I PROMISED TO DO SO REPLIED LESLIE
THE GIRLS WILL CALL ON YOU TO-MORROW EVENING SO YOU MUST BE AT HOME
DID YOU SAY THAT THAT WAS THE SECOND GONG MISS LESLIE GILROY IS MY NAME IS THAT THE SECOND GONG THE SECOND GONG SOUNDED TWO OR THREE MINUTES AGO THEN WE MUST FLY
BUT THE PROOF LIES IN THE QUEER DESOLATE EXPRESSION OF YOUR FACE
SHE SKIPPED ACROSS THE DRAWING-ROOM TO HER AUNT'S DAVENPORT TOOK OUT A SHEET OF PAPER RAPIDLY WROTE A FEW WORDS AND THEN BROUGHT HER LETTER TO MRS CHETWYND TO SIGN
DO YOU NEED ANY CLOTHES
IN FACT WE SCARCELY KNOW EACH OTHER
MY DEAR CHILD WHAT IS THE MATTER
HOW SILLY OF HER WELL PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE THAT I FOUND THE DOOR LOCKED WHEN I RETURNED SAID LESLIE
NOW LET ME TAKE YOU TO YOUR ROOM MRS ACHESON TOOK ANNIE UPSTAIRS
THE THING IS DONE
IS PAINSTAKING PERSEVERING CLEVER AND AFFECTIONATE
WITH MYSTERY THAT BREEDS ADVENTURE AND ENDS IN LOVE AND HAPPINESS
BELLE SLEPT WITH HER DOOR LOCKED AND ANNIE HEARD THE KEY BEING TURNED
I THOUGHT OF IT ALL NIGHT AND THE SCHEME SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DETECTED AND WAS MY LAST AND ONLY RESOURCE
NO NO
SHE SQUATTED DOWN ON A WOODEN BENCH IN AN UNGAINLY FASHION CROSSING ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER
DEAR OLD BELLE WHISPERED ONE OF THE GIRLS TO THE OTHER
I TOOK TREMENDOUS PAINS LEARNING IT
I CANNOT PRETEND TO BE OTHER THAN I AM WELL I HAVE NOT COME HERE TO PLEAD FOR MYSELF TO-DAY REPLIED LESLIE
I SAW HER IN CHAPEL ON SUNDAY THERE ARE MANY FINE POINTS ABOUT HER SAID LESLIE
IF SHE LEFT THAT ECCENTRIC YOUNG PERSON TO HERSELF THINGS AS A RULE TURNED OUT ACCORDING TO MRS ACHESON'S WISH
WE SHUT AWAY DELIBERATELY A VAST INFLUENCE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HELP TO PERVADE THE WORLD FOR A WOMAN CAN BE GRACEFUL PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AGREEABLE AND NOT SILLY
THE SILVER TEAPOT WAS ONE--IT WAS REAL SILVER NOT ELECTROPLATE
SHE WORE SPECTACLES NOT PINCE-NEZ
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAVED MY LIFE
I AM SURE WE SHALL BE FRIENDS MORE PARTICULARLY AS WE ARE TO START OUR NEW LIFE IN THE SAME HALL
I HAVE READ IT REPLIED LESLIE IN A LOW VOICE
A CHARMING LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY--WE SHALL GET IT FOR TWENTY POUNDS A YEAR
SHE NEEDS HELP AT ONCE
ANNIE WAS NOW QUITE COLLECTED AND CALM
I AM ALSO SURE THAT YOU ARE TROUBLED ABOUT SOMETHING
LESLIE GAVE ONE GLANCE FROM MR PARKER TO ANNIE AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD
HTTP://WWW.GUTENBERG.ORG/FILES/41326/41326-H/41326-H.HTM OR HTTP://WWW.GUTENBERG.ORG/FILES/41326/41326-H.ZIP THE GIRLS OF ST
WHAT CAN YOU MEAN SAID LESLIE
YOU ACCEPTED A SITUATION AT THAT BIG DRAPER'S ROUND THE CORNER
MARJORIE HAD NOT DARED TO COME OUT OF THE BOUDOIR
YOU WILL WRITE TO MISS LAUDERDALE WILL YOU NOT TO-NIGHT MY DEAR CHILD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WRITE TO HER YOURSELF AND I WILL SIGN THE LETTER
TRUST TO GOD PUTTING THINGS RIGHT BUT THE DREADFUL PART OF IT IS THOUGHT POOR LESLIE THAT HE IS MAKING ME SO HARD
DO YOU THINK I'D MIX MYSELF UP IN A MARE'S NEST OF THIS SORT
OH YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SHE HAS BEEN TRIED AND TEMPTED SHE CONTINUED TURNING TO THE MERCHANT
THAT LATTER FACT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO SOME OF US I CAN TELL YOU AS FLORRIE SAID THE LAST WORDS SHE ROSE
MY DEAR ADDED PARKER SUDDENLY TURNING AND LOOKING AT LESLIE YOU HAVE A LOOK OF YOUR FATHER THE BEST FELLOW THAT EVER BREATHED
IT WAS MADE OF SOFT BLACK SILK AND HAD RUFFLES OF LACE ROUND THE NECK AND WRISTS
SOME OF THE FEAR OF THE NIGHT BEFORE VISITED HER
DURING THAT TIME SHE WOULD TREASURE HER SHILLINGS AS IF THEY WERE GOLD
I HAVE BEEN IN THE POETIC MOOD FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AND LAST NIGHT THE POET'S FRENZY REALLY SEIZED ME
FOR ANNIE DID NOT APPRECIATE HER SACRIFICE EXCEPT IN AS FAR AS IT SAVED RUPERT
HE WAS GOOD AND KIND AND OH
I AM AFRAID YOUR BEDSTEAD IS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
WHAT A COMFORT IF SHE REMAINS IN THAT STATE FOR THE REST OF OUR ROW BELLE SAID MARJORIE WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW
SHIRLEY IS A SWEET COURAGEOUS HEROINE WHOSE SHINING EYES LURE FROM PAGE TO PAGE
I AM NOT GOING TO INFLUENCE YOU
WHAT IS YOUR NAME LESLIE GILROY LESLIE GILROY PLEASE TELL ME IF THAT IS THE FIRST OR SECOND GONG THE SECOND REPLIED LESLIE
AS TO ANNIE HERSELF THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVER PERMITTED THE ADVANCES OF ANY STUDENT
OH THE IRREPARABLE INJURY YOU TWO GIRLS HAVE DONE ME
WHAT IS WRONG LEW SAID THE MOTHER
THIS IS TUESDAY EVENING
SHE MAKES AN EXCELLENT SECRETARY
I TAKE THIS SIDE WITH THE BAY WINDOW
AT LAST THE BIG BASKET WAS QUITE FULL
LESLIE CONSIDERED THIS WITH BENT HEAD AND KNITTED BROWS
SHE WAS PUZZLED BY EILEEN AND MARJORIE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM AND WAS SCARCELY PREPARED TO LIKE THEM
I WILL TELL YOU WHY YOU WON'T HAVE ANY CHANCE MISS GILROY
WE MEAN TO WORK HARD
IN FIGURE SHE WAS EXTREMELY SPARE HER FEET AND HANDS WERE LARGE AND HER SHOULDERS ANGULAR
I WILL PUT IT TO THEM THAT IT IS THEIR BOUNDEN DUTY TO YIELD TO YOU
IT HAD NOT BEEN THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD MADE A GALLANT EFFORT TO DO SO
TA-TA
WHO WANTS COFFEE AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS NOW RUPERT WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO INDULGE IN A GOOD DINNER WOULD HAVE LIKED A CUP OF FRAGRANT COFFEE IMMENSELY
THE TEMPTATIONS HERE WERE TOO MUCH FOR YOU
NOW IF THERE WAS A GIRL IN THE ENTIRE OF ENGLAND THAT MRS CHETWYND LOATHED IT WAS BELLE ACHESON
GIRLS WHO ARE MERELY ORDERLY HAVE NO NICHE AT ST WODE'S
CHAPTER XVI--FRESHERS
THE WIDOW RELATED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
OH SHE AND I MUST INDEED BE ONE AFTER THIS ALL DURING THE REMAINDER OF OUR LIVES
YOUNG LADIES OF EIGHTEEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO ABOUT LONDON ALONE BUT REALLY MOTHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID MARJORIE
WE HAVE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN
NONSENSE MY DEAR
I HAVE LOWERED MYSELF
DON'T LET ME HAVE TO HUMBLE MYSELF IN VAIN WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANYTHING SO HUMILIATING IN YOUR ASKING A FAVOR OF YOUR FATHER'S GREATEST FRIEND SAID MR PARKER A KINDER NOTE COMING INTO HIS VOICE
REALLY THIS IS MOST INTERESTING
I BELIEVE IN A GOD AND THAT HE ANSWERS PRAYER I WONDER IF HE WILL SAID BELLE WITH A QUEER NEW SORT OF EXPRESSION ON HER FACE
BUT I WILL ADMIT IT DEAR IN A WHISPER THAT SHE IS ALSO ONE OF MY TRIALS
THE LIGHT IN HIS EYES SEEMED TO SHINE INTO MINE AND I FELT AGAIN THE WAY HE GRIPPED MY HAND
BUT THEY WORK FOR IT AND THEY GET THE HONOR WORSE AND WORSE CRIED MRS CHETWYND
IT IS THE FATE OF ALL FRESHERS CHAPTER XVI FRESHERS
I--I HAVE GOT THE MONEY LESLIE WHO WAS WATCHING HIM ATTENTIVELY SAW HIM CHANGE COLOR
RUPERT QUOTED A FEW SENTENCES OUT OF THE TESTAMENT IN HIS MELODIOUS VOICE TO BELLE WHO NODDED AND PRAISED HIS ACCENT
I DON'T KNOW MY WAY TO THE BROAD AT PRESENT AND WOULD RATHER BE WITH YOU THAN ALONE
I WANT YOU TO SEE THAT HE GOES
LETITIA HAS NOT YET SPOKEN SAID MRS CHETWYND.--"WHAT ARE YOUR WISHES MY LOVE WELL OF COURSE AUNT HELEN I SHOULD LIKE A SOCIETY-LIFE VERY MUCH BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO HAVE IT LETTIE SAID EILEEN
I DID NOT MEAN TO QUOTE IT SAID LESLIE
THEN FEELING A LITTLE BETTER SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND TOOK HER PLACE AT TABLE
IT WILL BE TOO LATE WHEN YOU COME BACK
THE ELDERLY CLERK WITH THE GRAY HAIR WENT INTO A ROOM AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE
SOON THEY WERE IN THE FULL FLOW OF A MOST ANIMATED CONVERSATION
YOU CANNOT DENY US OUR BIRTHRIGHT MAMMY CAN YOU COLLEGE GIRLS
COME LESLIE SAID HER MOTHER HERE IS YOUR PLACE BY ME AS USUAL
BUT AS TO HER BEING ILL I THINK SHE IS ALL RIGHT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WAIT IN MY ROOM UNTIL SHE COMES BACK NO THANK YOU
SHE NEVER MENTIONED YOU BY NAME AND I NEVER GUESSED UNTIL YESTERDAY WHEN SHE CALLED TO SEE ME THAT YOU WERE THE GIRL HER ROOMFELLOW SHE SAID WHOM SHE LIKED BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE AT ST WODE'S--THAT YOU WERE THE SAME GIRL WHOM I CARED FOR MORE THAN AUGHT ELSE IN THE WORLD OH YOU DON'T SAID LESLIE
WHAT I WANT IS THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH WELL I DID IT SAID ANNIE
I AM GOING AWAY AS I SEE IT IS YOUR WISH
LETTIE LOOKED AT LESLIE AND HER EYES FILLED WITH LAUGHTER
YOU WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SHE SAID
WHEN I COME BACK I WILL TALK WITH YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
BUT LEW--IT WOULD BE THE MAKING OF LEW
EILEEN MARJORIE AND LETITIA CHETWYND WERE EXPECTED HOME FROM SCHOOL
OH RUPERT SHE CRIED WHERE DID YOU COME FROM
THIS BOY FOR INSTANCE
MY FATHER AND MOTHER LIVED IN AMERICA WHERE THEY DIED
WELL I HOPE WE SHALL BE GOOD FRIENDS AND THAT I WON'T INCONVENIENCE YOU SAID THE OTHER GIRL
I HAVE PROMISED ANNE MORRISON TO CALL ON HER BEFORE DINNER TO-DAY
WHEN YOU WANT MONEY YOU JUST WRITE TO ME AND DON'T BOTHER THAT GOOD MOTHER OF YOURS OVERMUCH
I DO MY DEAR CHILD
I QUITE UNDERSTAND HOME LIFE IF IT IS THAT YOU ALLUDE TO I DON'T
IN HER MOTHER'S SMALL HOUSE THE MOTTO IMPRESSED UPON EACH CHILD WAS THE OLD-FASHIONED ONE
THERE IS NOTHING--NOTHING I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOU SHE SOBBED
LATE THAT EVENING THERE CAME A KNOCK AT LLEWELLYN'S DOOR
HE WAS THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE
IT IS DARK-BLUE AND DOES NOT REQUIRE TO BE WASHED OFTEN--THAT IS ONE ITEM OFF THE MIND
I AM GOING TO MAKE A CONFESSION
SELFISH AND INJURE HER REPEATED MARJORIE
BUT AS I HAVE GOT A SCREEN I SHALL PUT IT ROUND MY BED NOW THAT YOU HAVE WARNED ME
I SHALL CALL ON YOU AT MRS ACHESON'S THIS EVENING OH RUPERT SURELY YOU WOULDN'T DARE DARE SAID RUPERT
ANNIE WILL BE SO CROSS
OH IT'S JUST LIKE THAT WICKED LETTIE
IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT MR COLCHESTER SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BURGLARS
I ONLY TRUST NONE OF MY BOOKS MAY HIT YOU BY MISTAKE I ECHO THAT WISH SAID LESLIE
OH I AM A MISERABLE MOST MISERABLE GIRL CHAPTER XXIX 30 NEWBOLT SQUARE
SHE BENT AND KISSED HER ON HER FOREHEAD
NOW DO TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS AND GET INTO BED
I TRUST THE ANNOYANCE WON'T LAST LONG I HOPE NOT SAID LESLIE
I SHOULD NOT BELIEVE IT IF A THOUSAND ANNIE COLCHESTERS SWORE TO IT
MR PARKER CONTINUED TO READ THE EXPERT'S LETTER
HE WANTS TO BID YOU GOOD-BY NOW
BUT ALL THE SAME IT'S A HARD TUG HE MUTTERED AS HE GLANCED ROUND HIM
SHE PACED UP AND DOWN HER RESTLESSNESS AND THE QUEER DREAD WHICH ASSAILED HER INCREASING EACH MOMENT
THAT IS AN UGLY WORD SAID COLCHESTER
OF COURSE HE WANTS TO TELL YOU THIS NEWS ABOUT INDIA
SHE STOOPED AND KISSED HER MOTHER
THE STRAIN WAS BECOMING INTOLERABLE
THAT ONE GLANCE SHOWED THAT THE GIRL WAS THE MOTHER'S SPECIAL IDOL
PERHAPS YOUNG LADIES SAID THE FOOTMAN COMING TO THE RESCUE YOU WOULDN'T MIND GETTING INTO THE CARRIAGE FOR THE HORSES ARE THAT FRESH FOWLER CAN SCARCELY KEEP EM STANDING MUCH LONGER BUT IT'S QUITE SERIOUS ABOUT HIS WIFE NOT BEING STRONG SAID EILEEN IN A MEDITATIVE VOICE
THE OLD WRETCH CRIED RUPERT
THE DOOR WAS BURST OPEN AND BELLE RUSHED IN
HE WAS A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER AND DETERMINATION AND HAD ALL HIS LIFE BEEN THE VICTIM OF FADS
DID YOU EVER WANT MONEY SO BADLY SO DREADFULLY BADLY THAT YOU WOULD EVEN COMMIT A CRIME TO GET IT NEVER ANSWERED LESLIE
NOW IT IS MY TURN TO BE GOOD TO YOU
YOU WON'T GET THE BENEFIT YOU OUGHT TO DERIVE FROM A RESIDENCE AT ST WODE'S UNLESS YOU TAKE UP THE SOCIAL AS WELL AS THE LEARNED SIDE OF THE LIFE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID MARJORIE KNITTING HER PRETTY BROWS
MAMMY WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IN AT ONCE
AND AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS OF THAT SPLENDID TRAINING I AM YES YES YES
BUT THEN HER TOUCH WAS A CARESS
I HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO DO DURING THE THREE YEARS WHICH ARE BEFORE ME--A DELIGHTFUL THREE YEARS I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL PROVE
LESLIE LATE AS USUAL SAID MABEL
IT'S MUCH MORE HEALTHY FOR YOU TO GO TO BED IN GOOD TIME
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR THAT HE SAID
SHE THEN KNELT DOWN AND ENDEAVORED TO PEER THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
BUT AS SHE WAS ALLOWED NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO SUBMIT TO THE INEVITABLE
DO SPEAK YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SIXTY POUNDS
YOU WILL GET INTO A MOST AWFUL SCRAPE IF YOU DON'T
LESLIE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER WITHOUT REPLYING
HE SAID THAT IF HE DID NOT GET THE MONEY HE WOULD BE LOCKED UP
BUT I DON'T AT ALL KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO ACCEPT EVEN THOUGH MOTHER IS SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME LEAVE SAID LESLIE
A LOW SOB CAME FROM MARJORIE'S LIPS
DEAR ME I AM AN UNHAPPY WOMAN
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DECEIVE YOU
HOW YOU FRIGHTENED ME SAID MRS ACHESON COMING IN
IT IS VERY HOT SHE SAID
LESLIE HAD THREE LECTURES TO GO TO AND WAS THANKFUL FOR THIS AS SHE DID NOT CARE TO BE ALONE IN THE ROOM WITH ANNIE
SHE WENT TO BED FEELING INTENSELY UNCOMFORTABLE
I HAVE PRAYED SHE SAID
LET IT BE SATURDAY THEN SHE SAID
BUT EILEEN AND MARJORIE
AND THEN I HOPE YOU WILL RETURN TO MY ROOM GIRLS FOR COCOA
THE MAIN CHANCE
SHE HAS LEFT THE SICK-ROOM FOR A WONDER AND GONE INTO HER OWN AND THERE SHE HAS BROKEN DOWN IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MANNER
ALICE AND I ALSO HAVE A MOTHER--SUCH A DARLING BUT I DO WISH YOU HAD A ROOM TO YOURSELF YOU POOR OLD THING SAID ALICE SMART
LETTIE SAT IN THE STERN AND HELD THE RUDDER ROPES
BUT UNPACK MY THINGS I SIMPLY MUST THANKS TO HER MOTHER'S EXCELLENT TRAINING LESLIE WAS A PROFICIENT IN THE ART OF STOWING AWAY THINGS IN SMALL SPACES
I WAS WONDERING HOW I COULD GET TO THE BROAD FOR I DON'T KNOW MANY GIRLS YET
EACH OF HER LITTLE EXCUSES EACH OF HER SMALL EFFORTS TO GET THE GIRLS TO REMAIN AT HOME WITH HER TO GO INTO SOCIETY TO LEAD THE ORDINARY LIFE OF THE ORDINARY YOUNG WOMAN WERE QUIETLY AND POLITELY DEMOLISHED BY BOTH EILEEN AND MARJORIE
MR PARKER CAME HERE TODAY AND TOLD YOU WHAT I DID YESTERDAY AND YOU DID NOT TELL HIM THE TRUTH
FINALLY MRS CHETWYND FOUND HERSELF SAYING SHE WOULD THINK ABOUT THE MATTER
HER CHEEKS WERE SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND THE LONG BLACK LASHES LOOKED PARTICULARLY HANDSOME AS THEY LAY AGAINST HER ROSY CHEEKS
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT BELLE KNEW ABOUT HER ANXIETY WITH REGARD TO ANNIE
HE IS GOING TO AUSTRALIA
SHE STARTED TO HER FEET
SHE CALLED LLEWELLYN TO FOLLOW HER
I AM GLAD YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO ME
SHE DID HER UTMOST TO CRUSH MISS FRERE DECLARING THAT IF WOMAN THE MODERN WOMAN WHO HAD SUCH A VAST WORK BEFORE HER WAS TO SPEND HER LIFE DEVOTING HERSELF TO THE PLEASURES OF THE TOILET TO SOCIETY TO MERE ORNAMENTATION TO THE THOUGHT OF WHAT OTHERS WOULD THINK OF HER SHE WOULD BE FRITTERING AWAY HER BIRTHRIGHT AND WOULD BE A DESPICABLE CREATURE
I SHOULD THINK YOU WILL SAID ANNIE IN A TONE ALMOST OF AFFECTION
HER HEAD WAS ACHING VIOLENTLY
THE OCTOPUS IS A STORY OF WHEAT RAISING AND RAILROAD GREED IN CALIFORNIA
ASK MISS COLCHESTER INTO MY WAITING-ROOM AND SAY I WILL SEND FOR HER PRESENTLY WAS THE REPLY
HAVING SPILT THE INK THREE OR FOUR TIMES I HAVE DISCARDED THE CLOTH
YOU'RE A BRAVE SORT OF GIRL AND I DON'T MIND--THAT IS SHORT OF RUINING MYSELF IT WILL NOT RUIN YOU
ISN'T SHE MARJORIE A PERFECT ANGEL SAID MARJORIE
EILEEN IS BETTER SHE CRIED
I REMEMBER NOW
HEAR SAID EILEEN
WHAT IS WRONG ONLY THAT I HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH AT LAST LESLIE
MRS ACHESON WAS VERY KIND--SHE WAS LIKE A MOTHER TO ME
CHAPTER XXV THE PRAYER OF FAITH
YOU HAVE LOOKED SO ILL SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US
I DON'T KNOW
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
THERE IS NO DOUBT SHE IS CARRYING A TERRIBLE HEAVY BURDEN AND SHE WON'T LET ANYONE HELP HER
MOTHER SUPPLIES THEM
BUT THE AIR WILL DO ME GOOD
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU MY FATHER'S OLD FRIEND ARE CRUEL SHE SAID
BUT MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NEXT TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
MIGHT WE NOT CALL AND ASK HER TO COME TO THE BROAD WITH US
I WAS THE HAPPIEST OF GIRLS YESTERDAY
SAFE
I AM DRAWN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A MOTHERLESS GIRL SHE SAID
SHE IS A FEARFUL CREATURE A SORT OF MONSTER
BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME HOME FOR GOOD THERE WILL BE MUCH TO TALK OVER AND ARRANGE
IT'S NOT IN ME TO TAKE FAVORS FROM ANYONE
CHAPTER XXII THE PROMISE
SHE CALLED ANNIE'S NAME
SHE WAS WEARING THE UNIVERSAL COAT AND SKIRT
I WAS QUITE A CHILD WHEN I CAME TO ENGLAND
I AM AN UNMARRIED MAN AND SO ARE YOU
NEAT BUT NOT GAUDY SHE SAID
WHAT CAN IT ALL MEAN SAID ANNIE
YOU WILL KNOW FOR YOURSELF BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN MANY DAYS AT ST WODE'S WAS LETTIE'S ENIGMATICAL REPLY
A CHARMING COLOR CAME INTO THE GIRL'S FACE AS SHE RECEIVED THE SMALL ATOM OF HUMANITY ON HER KNEE
SO COME AT ONCE I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART AND I WILL COME SAID ANNIE
THEN THEY PUT AN ORNAMENTAL SORT OF PIANO-SHEET OVER THE BACK OF THE DRAWERS AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF ORNAMENTAL FURNITURE ORNAMENTAL INSTEAD OF USEFUL
SHE WISHED TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD DINE WITH THEM THIS EVENING
WILL YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND ANNIE THAT I REALLY WISH TO HELP YOU YOU CAN HELP ME BY HOLDING YOUR TONGUE SAID ANNIE
I WON'T SIN AGAIN FOR HIM
THEY WILL BE HOME IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
WHATEVER IS IN HERE BELLE
THE SIDE-DOOR WAS NOT YET LATCHED AND ANNIE LET HERSELF IN
THEN YOU WILL GIVE IN ALL ROUND MAMMY DEAR SAID MARJORIE
AND SO HE SPOKE OF ME AS A SCOUNDREL DID HE
HER FACE WAS LARGE AND SOMEWHAT SUNBURNT HER HANDS WELL SHAPED BUT WITH A LOOK ABOUT THEM WHICH SHOWED THAT THEY WERE NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH MANUAL LABOR
SHE SAT UP IN BED
SHE MUST HAVE PICTURES
NOW EILEEN OUGHT TO HAVE NO ANXIOUS PERSON IN HER ROOM
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THAT SAME DAY MARJORIE WENT TO LIE DOWN
YOU ARE ANNIE COLCHESTER THE QUEER EXTRAORDINARY GIRL WHO WAS ALMOST AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS I AM TO WIN DISTINCTION TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TO ACQUIRE THE GREAT THE GLORIOUS POSSESSION OF KNOWLEDGE I AM THE SAME ANSWERED ANNIE
HE WISHES YOU TO GO SAID THE MOTHER QUIETLY
HAVING SUPPLIED THEM WITH A NEWSPAPER EACH HE LEFT THEM
SHE HASTILY PUT ON HER DRESSING-GOWN AND WITH CANDLE IN HAND ADVANCED TO WHERE THE OTHER GIRL WAS PACING
EVEN PRISON WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS PRESENT AGONY THOUGHT THE POOR GIRL
SHE KNEW THAT THE TIME FOR ACTION HAD COME
THE THREE GIRLS ENTERED THE DINING ROOM
MOST OF THE GIRLS WERE ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE NEW SCHEME
SO MUCH DEPENDS ON ALL THAT SORT OF THING BEING KEPT OUT OF THE SICKROOM
MR COLCHESTER THAT CHARMING SCHOLARLY DELIGHTFUL MAN ENTER THE HOUSE IN ORDER TO TAKE MY BOX OF MONEY--IMPOSSIBLE
I DO NOT KNOW WHERE AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW
AND HE HELD OUT A GREAT ROUGH HAND FOR THE GIRL TO SHAKE
HER PURCHASES TOOK TIME AND IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES EILEEN AND MARJORIE WERE INTERESTED
DO YOU SEE MY STUDY TABLE
SHAKE HANDS
I HAVE TAKEN NO END OF PAINS WITH YOU BOTH
JANE HERIOT HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE OF THE PRETTIEST AND MOST TASTEFULLY ARRANGED ROOMS IN NORTH HALL
SHE WAS A TALL SLIM VERY PLAINLY-DRESSED GIRL
LESLIE WAS ENGAGED TO ATTEND A COCOA-PARTY AT WEST HALL THAT EVENING
THESE OCCUPIED HER ATTENTION DURING THE MEAL AND SHE SCARCELY SPOKE TO ANYONE
I LOVE MY MOTHER MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY REPLIED LESLIE
SHE TOOK OUT HER NIGHTDRESS AND SOON AFTERWARD GOT INTO BED
ANNIE I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH THEN YOU ARE AN ANGEL AFTER ALL
WHEN BELLE MENTIONED TO HER MOTHER THAT SHE HAD INVITED A ST WODE'S GIRL TO STAY WITH HER MRS ACHESON WAS PLEASED
WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY CLARENCE F
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE
ONE GLANCE SHOWED LESLIE THAT SHE WAS WALKING IN HER SLEEP
FOR IF YOU DON'T MOTHER WILL BEGIN TO TAKE TO YOU MORE THAN EVER AND THAT WILL NOT SUIT MY PLANS AT ALL ANNIE WENT TO HER ROOM
ESTHER PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE THINGS OUT OF MARJORIE'S TRUNK AND EILEEN WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT WHISTLING SOMEWHAT LOUDLY AND IN A THOROUGHLY BOYISH FASHION AS SHE DID SO
BUT SOMETHING VERY GREAT AND UNCOMMON MUST HAVE INDUCED HER TO PUT IT ON
THERE WERE TWO LETTERS FOR HERSELF--ONE FROM HER MOTHER AND ONE FROM LLEWELLYN
I THINK A LITTLE FRESH AIR WOULD DO YOU GOOD
YOU DIDN'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SEEK IT
YES I WANT TO FIND MRS CHETWYND REPLIED LESLIE IN A LOW VOICE
MY DEAR CHILD YOU WILL BE ON YOUR NOSE OH NEVER MIND MOTHER SAID EILEEN
YOU CAN SCARCELY GUESS WHAT A RELIEF YOU ARE BY WAY OF CONTRAST THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR SAYING ANYTHING SO NICE REPLIED LESLIE
THE GIRLS IMMEDIATELY STOPPED TURNED AND FACED HER
I AM EVER THINKING OF KINGSLEY'S PASSIONATE WORDS BE EARNEST EARNEST EARNEST
SHE IS MOTHER'S RIGHT HAND AND ABOUT THE VERY BEST GIRL IN THE WORLD
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
SHE INSTANTLY REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD GOT OUT OF ORDER THAT MORNING AND HEARD MRS ACHESON SAY THAT SHE MUST SEND FOR A MAN TO REPAIR IT
I DID NOT BETRAY YOU YOU DID NOT BETRAY ME
AND THEN PUTTING ON HER HAT AND GLOVES SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS
HE HAD A SMATTERING OF GREEK AND LATIN AT HIS FINGERS ENDS BUT NO MORE
STAY THOUGH LET ME FEEL YOUR PULSE SHE CAUGHT ANNIE'S WRIST BETWEEN HER FINGER AND THUMB
MARRIAGE IS WHAT PROVIDENCE INTENDS FOR ALL HAPPY WOMEN EARLY MARRIAGE AND HAPPY HOMES OF THEIR OWN
SHE WON'T LET ME COMFORT HER AND IT IS DREADFUL TO SEE THAT DULL LOOK OF AGONY AND SUFFERING IN HER EYES THOUGHT LESLIE
LESLIE I AM GOING OUT
I LIE DOWN AND TRY TO SLEEP SHE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM SCARCELY WAITING TO BID EITHER LADY GOOD-NIGHT
YOU WON'T MIND WILL YOU IF YOU HEAR ME PACING BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR BECAUSE I DO SO MOST NIGHTS I AM SORRY SAID LESLIE TRYING TO SMOTHER HER OWN FEELINGS OF ANNOYANCE
SHE SHUT HER EYES
I LIVE SO FIXEDLY BY RULE
HE HAD A FINE FIGURE SQUARE SHOULDERS AND A SWAGGER IN HIS WALK
I EITHER FORGET WHAT I AM TOLD OR I BLURT IT OUT TO THE NEXT PERSON I COME ACROSS
BE TRUE TO YOUR SENSE OF HONOR
YOU DON'T LOOK NATURAL MARJORIE
BUT HER COMPANION'S NEXT REMARK DISPELLED THIS ILLUSION
THE FEVER IS NOT INFECTIOUS TO US YOU KNOW SHE CONTINUED AND THAT IN A KIND OF WAY IS A COMFORT
SHE IS A BUTTERFLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SUPPRESSED
WHEN HE IS AWAY I WANT ANNIE TO BECOME YOUR SECRETARY
HE DROVE YOU TO IT AND HE MUST KNOW
HE HAD AN EXPRESSIVE FACE CAPABLE OF ALMOST ANY EMOTION
SHE THEN TURNED AND SPOKE TO MARJORIE
HE CEASED TO BE FURIOUS AND BECAME IN THE POOR GIRL'S OPINION FAR MORE DANGEROUS
AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO
THIS WILL KILL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER ANNIE DEAR SAID LESLIE AGAIN
THEN SHE SAID CHEERFULLY
THE SAME DARK HANDSOME EYES BEAMED OUT OF EACH FACE THE SAME GOOD ARCHED BROWS THE SAME HAIR THICK AND STRAIGHT VERY DARK IN COLOR BUT CROPPED TO WITHIN AN INCH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE HEADS
CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO THANK YOU REPLIED LESLIE
I HAVE FOUND OUT FOR MYSELF THAT MUCH STUDY IS A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH
THERE WAS A WIDE AND SMOOTHLY KEPT GRASS LAWN IN FRONT OF THE HALLS AND A GRAVEL SWEEP GOING RIGHT ROUND THEM
HIS MANNERS TO BELLE WERE ALL THAT COULD BE DESIRED
FEVER I DO NOT KNOW THAT I DID
HE IS SO SINCERE AND SO STRAIGHTFORWARD MAY I GO TO BED SAID ANNIE SUDDENLY
CHAPTER XXX ANNIE IN THE TOILS
IT IS VERY STRONG AND WON'T TEAR AND IS THE SORT WHICH DOES NOT CRUMPLE MUCH IT IS ALL OVER GREASE REPLIED LETITIA
MISS LAUDERDALE AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH HER KIND EYES WERE FIXED ON BELLE'S EXCITED FACE SPOKE
SO YOU REALLY STUDIED AND THEN ONCE MORE THE CONVERSATION ASSUMED ITS CLASSICAL COMPLEXION
THUS I SHOULD BE ALTOGETHER OFF MOTHER'S HANDS AND COULD EVEN HELP HER A TRIFLE
I KNOW SHE IS IN THE ROOM TOO
SHE SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO
I AM CERTAIN IT IS MORE THAN A MERE HEADACHE
BUT AFTER I HAVE ASKED YOU ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS WE WILL NEVER ALLUDE TO THE MATTER AGAIN
THEY HAD PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH SEATS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT IN A VERY FREE-AND-EASY MANNER
I THINK YOU ARE ACTING WISELY SAID MISS FRERE
OH SAID LESLIE
THANK GOODNESS THEY ARE GONE AT LAST CRIED MRS CHETWYND
OH I AM SO HAPPY SHE KISSED LESLIE AGAIN AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AS QUICKLY AS SHE HAD ENTERED
IS THERE NOT ANY MESSAGE YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TAKE ANNIE NONE
I SAW MISS BROWNING AFTER BREAKFAST
I KNOW YOU WILL HELP ME IF YOU CAN
TELL ME IS A BENCH NECESSARY AS WELL AS SIX ORDINARY CHAIRS AND AN ARMCHAIR
JUST AS MISS LESLIE LIKES OF COURSE BUT LESLIE HAD LEFT THE ROOM
AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE YOUNG LADIES COULD NOT BE INJURED BY ANY ONE SO PLAIN AND UNIMPORTANT
CLOTHES TOSSED HELTER-SKELTER EVERYWHERE
YOU TOLD HER THAT IF SHE TOLD THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THE MONEY YOU WOULD GIVE ME THE POST
THE GIRLS LUGGAGE WAS TO FOLLOW THEM
SHE WROTE IT TO THE MAN WHO IS KINDER TO ME THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
OH POOR POOR ANNIE
HE NODDED TO ANNIE AS HE LEFT THE ROOM
NOW PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT AGAIN WHILE I CONTINUE MY SHORT ADDRESS.--I PROPOSE THAT THE GIRLS OF ST WODE'S--THAT IS THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO DO SO--SHOULD TAKE UP AN EXTENSIVE DISTRICT OF THE POOR IN THIS LARGE TOWN OF WINGFIELD
YES HE IS WELCOME PROVIDED HE DOES NOT COME MORE THAN ONCE
JUST THE SORT OF ROOM I'D EXPECT GILROY'S WIDOW TO HAVE
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE DO
I WAS MISTAKEN
LESLIE LOOKED FULL AT ANNIE
UP TO THE PRESENT YOU HAVE NEVER LET IT DIE
HE OWED THE MONEY FOR A DEBT OF SUCH A NATURE THAT IF HE DID NOT PAY IT HE WOULD BE LOCKED UP WELL ALL THIS IS COMING TO THE POINT WITH A VENGEANCE SAID MR PARKER
NOW DRINK THIS AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SLEEP ANNIE STARED VACANTLY AT THE COCOA THEN SHE UTTERED A LAUGH
I HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA OF PUTTING MYSELF UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY MAN
IS THAT RIGHT TO YOUR MOTHER I WON'T SEE MOTHER AND I WON'T SEE LETTIE
I AM HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE STUDENTS THE REAL STUDENTS
BUT WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME THIS MORNING THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TOWN AND WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU
AND BELLE WAS SO FLATTERED BY HIS COVERT GLANCES BY HIS SKILLFULLY VEILED COMPLIMENTS BY HIS PRETENDED COMPREHENSION OF HER AND HER MOODS THAT SHE NEVER GUESSED HOW SHALLOW WERE HIS ACQUIREMENTS AND OPENED OUT HERSELF MORE AND MORE
SHE WAS VERY CLEVER AND STRONG BOTH IN MIND AND BODY
WHO HAS TAKEN THE KEY
MARJORIE PUT HER HAND QUICKLY TO HER FOREHEAD
EILEEN MADE NO REPLY
BUT TELL ME NOW GIRLS HOW YOU ARE BOTH GETTING ON VERY WELL INDEED SAID EILEEN
JUST CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HAD BETRAYED ME THAT TIME IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BETTER FOR ME AND FOR YOU TOO IF I HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH SAID LESLIE
BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW ANY PEOPLE IN WINGFIELD MISS GILROY I HAVE AN INTRODUCTION TO ONE OF THE DONS MR MATCHESON SAID LESLIE
YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP ME SAID BELLE LOOKING AT ANNIE WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE
SHE GAZED UP AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
SOME DAY ANNIE YOU SHALL COME AND LIVE WITH ME IN MY HOSTEL
I--I FEEL A LITTLE FAINT POOR CHILD NO WONDER
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE DARLING OF MY HEART
LESLIE STOOD AND THOUGHT ABOUT HER FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
THE FACT IS I AM NOT IN THE HUMOR TO BE ANYTHING BUT DISOBLIGING NOW THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE
AND IS IT DARK OR FAIR IT'S SIX WEEKS OLD MISS AND VERY DARK
SHE SAW THAT THE GIRL HAD HOT WATER SAID THAT BELLE WOULD BE GLAD TO LEND HER ANYTHING UNTIL HER OWN TRUNK ARRIVED AND LEFT HER
I'LL FIND THEM
WHEN I KNOW THE SIMPLE TRUTH LESLIE GILROY I WILL RESTORE YOU INTO MY FULL FAVOR AGAIN AND YOUR FRIEND SHALL BE MY PRIVATE SECRETARY THEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID REPLIED POOR LESLIE TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT
I JUST HAD A WILD HOPE FOR A MOMENT WHEN MOTHER SPOKE ABOUT GOOD NEWS THAT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME
GET THE GOOD MAMMA TO COME TOO
I CAN STAND THINGS AS THEY ARE NO LONGER
THE MORE I THINK OVER THAT BLACK BUSINESS THE LESS I LIKE IT
HOW TIRED YOU MUST BE SAID THIS GIRL
I AM SORRY I HAVE BEEN RUDE TO YOU OF LATE SHE SAID
OF COURSE IF I CAN BE OF THE LEAST USE TO MARJORIE I SHALL BE GLAD TO STAY HERE IS PAPER IF YOU WANT IT SAID LETTIE
IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH BEAUTY ABOVE THE AVERAGE
THE FAIR AND DELIGHTFUL MISS BELLE SHALL BE MY DELIVERER
WE WILL LEAVE OUT THE QUESTION ABOUT YOUR DESERVINGS FOR THE PRESENT SAID THE MERCHANT
THEN YOU ARE A SNEAK--A SPY
I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY LIFE SAID MR PARKER
EILEEN IS AS ILL AS SHE CAN BE AND I AM GOING TO PRAY FOR HER
AND LLEWELLYN AND LESLIE THE ELDEST BOY AND GIRL SYMPATHIZED HEART AND SOUL WITH HER
HOW QUEER MARJORIE CHETWYND LOOKED NO WONDER SAID LESLIE
MRS ACHESON WAS MRS CHETWYND'S OLD FRIEND
I MUST HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF
MY DEAR GOOD CREATURE IMPOSSIBLE
HE WAS IN THE DEEPEST DISTRESS AND YOU--YOU CONFIDED IN HIM SAID RUPERT COLCHESTER
NOW WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS HE SAID
NOBLE
SHE WOULD BE SURE PRESENTLY TO RETURN TO THIS SIDE-DOOR
HOW VERY QUEER YOU LOOK I WILL TELL YOU IN A FEW WORDS EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN
AT LAST I HAVE NEWS HER FACE GREW SUDDENLY WHITE AS DEATH
DON'T KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE
THE FACT IS POOR FELLOW HE HAD A WIFE OF HIS OWN AND A DAUGHTER AND IF THE DAUGHTER WERE ALIVE SHE WOULD BE YOUR AGE LESLIE
HOW LUXURIOUS WE SHALL BE
ON THE CONTRARY WE ARE POOR
SHE WAS PLAINLY EVEN SHABBILY DRESSED
IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE CEASED TO REMEMBER HERSELF AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HER FRIEND THAT HER WORDS WENT UP TO GOD AT FIRST IN BROKEN UTTERANCES THEN MORE EARNESTLY AND MORE FULL OF FAITH
I BELIEVE NOW THAT I WAS SELFISH ABOUT MOTHER
I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS GIRLS SAID LETTIE AS SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
MY TROUBLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY STUDIES
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY MOTHER
NOW DON'T I BEG OF YOU GET INTO HER SET OH I SHALL NEVER DO THAT REPLIED LESLIE
AND WHY WAS SHE DOING IT
USING A LITTLE FORCE SHE GOT ANNIE TO SIT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE BED
YOU MUST GET TWENTY POUNDS FOR YOUR BROTHER WITHIN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS OR THERE IS A PRISON AHEAD OF HIM OH RUPERT
SIT DOWN PRAY SHE SAID
BUT I HAVE RISEN TO THIS GREAT EFFORT ON ANNIE'S BEHALF
SHE WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME A NICE RETURN YOU HAVE MADE FOR HER KINDNESS I KNOW THAT WELL
OH AFTER A FASHION BUT NEVER THE REAL THING
SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LESLIE WAS JUST GOING INTO THE HALL WHEN LETTIE RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS
IF I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO YOU ANNIE UNDERSTAND THAT I SHALL BE ONLY TOO PLEASED DO YOU MEAN IT SAID ANNIE
MARJORIE CHETWYND COMES TO ST WODE'S COLLEGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SPRING TERM BEGINS IN A FORTNIGHT MARJORIE SO YOU HAVE LITTLE TIME TO LOSE.--NOW EILEEN LET ME LOOK AT YOU
YOU CANNOT GET YOUR CERTIFICATE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO A DEGREE UNDER THAT TIME YOUR CERTIFICATE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO A DEGREE LETTIE
THE WINDOWS WERE NOT MORE THAN THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND
BUT THERE I AM MUCH BETTER THIS EVENING MUCH BETTER LESLIE DID NOT MAKE ANY REPLY
HE FEELS LEAVING YOU SO MUCH LEAVING ME SAID ANNIE
I THOUGHT OF COURSE SHE HAD GONE ACROSS TO THE HALL
SHE SAID SHE DID NOT KNOW ANY SONG ABOUT NOTHING TO WEAR NOR ANY SONG EITHER ABOUT DRESS
MAY I NOT ACCEPT MY OWN INVITATION OR AM I TO BE BEHOLDEN TO YOU WELL COME IF YOU LIKE SAID POOR ANNIE
CHAPTER XIV A COCOA PARTY--CONTINUED
I WILL GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED A YEAR IF YOU WISH TO GO TO OXFORD NO THANK YOU ANSWERED THE BOY
IN ADDITION TO POETRY OF THE MIDDLE AGES A DUCKING IS MORE THAN I AM PREPARED FOR BELLE RESEATED HERSELF MADE AN IMPATIENT GESTURE PUSHED BACK HER MUSHROOM HAT AND RESUMED
THAT AWFUL GIRL GAVE ME THE NAME
I AM DYING TO SHOW YOU MY ROOM
SHE CAME HERE WITH ME
YOU MIGHT TAKE HER TO RICHMOND REALLY MOTHER ANSWERED BELLE IN A TART AND INJURED VOICE DO YOU SUPPOSE I HAVE TIME FOR SUCH FRIVOLITY FOR A DRIVE WITH NO OBJECT WHATEVER EXCEPT TO INHALE THE AIR
A CHARMING FELLOW AND WHAT A NICE EXPRESSION SAID MRS ACHESON
I BEGIN TO THINK I LIKE THINGS HELTER-SKELTER OH I DON'T MIND OF COURSE ANSWERED LESLIE
GOOD-BY FOR THE PRESENT CHAPTER XXVII TELL ME THE TRUTH LESLIE
TAKING GREAT CARE SHE UNLOCKED IT STILL WITHOUT MAKING ANY SOUND
YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MARJORIE AND EILEEN
RUN UPSTAIRS NOW AND KEEP QUIET
SHE IS A DEAR OLD THING
I HONESTLY CONFESS THAT I AM QUITE FOND OF CLOTHES AND I LIKE TO LOOK SMART WELL DEAR IT IS A COMFORT THAT I SHALL HAVE YOU TO STAY WITH ME BUT AUNT HELEN I AM EVER SO SORRY
MARJORIE HAD FLUNG HERSELF FACE DOWNWARDS ON THE BED
IT ALONE REQUIRES CAREFUL ATTENTION WHY BELLE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IN A NUNNERY THERE NOW YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME I AM NOT INDEED
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY AIM IN LIFE IS SAID BELLE AT LAST
IT WOULD WORRY YOU AND WE WOULD MUCH RATHER NOT WORRY YOU
POOR GIRL I RATHER PITY HER
DON'T BE ALARMED ABOUT EITHER OF US PRAY
THEY WERE TOGETHER LOOKING ALREADY QUITE AT HOME AND PERFECTLY CONTENTED
SAY TO ME MR PARKER FOR THE SAKE OF MY FATHER LET ME HAVE FIVE POUNDS OR TEN OR FIFTEEN OR WHATEVER SUPPLY YOU WANT
AND I BELIEVE THAT ANNIE AND I WILL ENJOY THE INANITY AS YOU CALL IT IMMENSELY
BUT THE CARES OF THE WORLD HAVE HER IN THEIR GRIP
I OUGHT NOT TO LEAVE YOU
DO SLEEP--ENJOY IT--LOOK LIKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL TO-MORROW
I AM CERTAIN ALTHOUGH YOU WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT THAT YOU ARE MISSING ST WODE'S IN MANY WAYS I AM DEAR OH THIS IS DELICIOUS SAID BELLE
SHE CROSSED THE ROOM THEREFORE QUICKLY AND STOOD BEFORE A DESK WHERE AN ELDERLY MAN WITH GRAY HAIR WAS WRITING
PRAY DON'T WORRY BUT BELLE THIS IS INTOLERABLE
BUT AS HE DID SO HE LOOKED BEYOND HER AT LESLIE
BUT WHAT ABOUT IT
WITH ONE DRESS FOR SUMMER AND ONE DRESS FOR WINTER SURELY WE DON'T WANT MUCH ROOM I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS EILEEN SAID MARJORIE I MEAN TO USE MINE AS A DARK-ROOM FOR PHOTOGRAPHY--CAPITAL EXCELLENT
OH IT IS SO SOOTHING
I BROUGHT HER HERE OR RATHER SHE WOULD COME
I'LL RUN UP TO THEM
YOU ARE LIKE TWO MINERS COME TO DIG OUT THE GOLD
HE IS A RASCAL
IT IS FEARFUL TO THINK OF IT WELL THEY DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE A DEGREE BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALLOWED SAID LETTIE
IT'S JUST INTOLERABLE I WISH YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ME LLEWELLYN SAID LESLIE
BUT FASHIONABLE SOCIETY GIRLS WE WILL NOT BE
NOW DO COME GIRLS
BUT HER EYES WERE LARGE AND TOO BRILLIANT FOR HEALTH
WE WILL GO OUT WITH YOU NOW AND WE'LL BE AS GOOD AS GOLD AND YOU SHALL GET US EACH A NEW DARK-BLUE SERGE DRESS AND A NEW SAILOR HAT AND A PAIR OF THICK DOGSKIN GLOVES
I HAVE SPOKEN TO OUR RECTOR ON THE SUBJECT AND HE THINKS THAT THEY COULD CARRY ON A THOROUGH WORK OF SUPERVISION AND OF INTEREST IN THE POOR WITHOUT ENDANGERING THEIR OWN HEALTH IN THE VERY LEAST
OH I ASSURE YOU THE SIMPLEST COVERING DOES
THERE WAS A LOOK OF DESPAIR IN HER EYES
BY THE WAY YOU HAVE PASSED YOUR EXAM BEFORE NOW
LESLIE GILROY WANTS TO SEE YOU AT ONCE
THE REST OF ALL THAT ONLY BODIES BEAR ROLL UP AND DOWN AND FILL UP BUT THE ROW VERY FINE INDEED SAID LETTIE
SHE ADVANCED A STEP OR TWO ACROSS THE ROOM AND THEN PAUSED
I FEEL FIT TO DIE WHEN I THINK HOW I MISTRUSTED YOU YOU HAD GOOD REASONS TO MISTRUST ME AND I AM NOT THE LEAST SURPRISED
I AM SIMPLY SITTING AND LISTENING
AT LEAST THERE NEED BE NO MORE STUDY SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
BUT WE ARE QUITE DETERMINED THAT WE WILL NOT WASTE OUR TIME NOR OUR MONEY IN DRESS OR ORNAMENTS HERE SHE GLANCED DISAPPROVINGLY ROUND THE EXQUISITELY FURNISHED LITTLE ROOM
JUST THE PLAINEST ROOMS
NOW PRAY LISTEN
I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
OH THE SIN WAS TOO DARK
THE BRAIN IS MASTER OF THE BODY
AS SHE APPROACHED THE DOOR A FURIOUS SOUND OF SOMEONE PACING UP AND DOWN FELL ON HER EARS
I WONDER IF IT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE SAME VERY LIKELY ANSWERED LESLIE
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS
IF YOU DID NOT TAKE HONORS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN THEM
IF MRS ACHESON REALLY KNEW THE SORT OF MAN SHE WAS RECEIVING INTO HER HOUSE WOULD SHE EVER FORGIVE ANNIE
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE SO TIRED OF BEING LEFT BY YOURSELF I USED TO COME IN AND RISK TAKING THE BEASTLY THING A SECOND TIME TO AMUSE YOU
NOW YOUR DRESS EILEEN IS NOT SUITABLE
I WANT TO GO IN FOR LEARNING OF COURSE
I AM SURE YOU MEAN VERY WELL INDEED AND IN SOME WAYS I AGREE WITH YOU
I WAS ILL AND I AM ILL STILL BUT MY ILLNESS IS NOT OF THE BODY
HE WAS A TALL AND VERY BENEVOLENT-LOOKING MAN WITH WHITE HAIR AND DARK EYES
HE HAS THE RIGHT STUFF IN HIM
AND FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR RESPECTABILITY YOU MUST NOT GO ABOUT IN ABSOLUTE RAGS
I OVERHEARD YOU JANE SHE SAID
DID SHE--DID SHE--TELL YOU--ANYTHING NOTHING SPECIAL DEAR EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS SURE I MIGHT STAY HERE
YOU LESLIE WILL BE SURE TO TAKE PART IN THIS NOBLE WORK IF I HAVE TIME I CERTAINLY WILL REPLIED LESLIE
I'LL GIVE YOU CAPITAL AND YOU MAY DO WELL--ANY LINE YOU LIKE
BUT PERHAPS AS YOU SAY SHE IS YOUR GUEST
THEY WOULD MAKE HANDSOME BOYS
WHAT FOR INSTANCE ARE YOUR AIMS WITH REGARD TO LITERATURE
AND YET I AM NOT SURE THAT I WISH TO BE SCHOLARLY
IT OCCURRED TO HER TO GO UP AND LOOK AT HER DARLINGS ASLEEP
NOT WRONG
CHAPTER II--IN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE
GIVE HER A SLEEPING DRAUGHT ERICSON WON'T YOU
A QUEER EXPRESSION FILLED HER EYES
THERE IS ABOUT IT A SWEETNESS A WHOLESOMENESS AND A STURDINESS THAT COMMENDS IT TO EARNEST KINDLY AND WHOLESOME PEOPLE."--_BOSTON TRANSCRIPT GROSSET DUNLAP PUBLISHERS NEW YORK
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MYSELF MUM AND DISAGREEABLE OH YOU ARE NEVER THAT YOU DEAR OLD DARLING
SHE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IN HER DUSTY BOOTS
IF I HAD THOUGHT ANNIE COLCHESTER'S BEING HERE WOULD MEAN ALL THIS SORT OF THING I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE I INVITED HER IT WAS NOW MRS ACHESON'S TURN TO MAKE NO REPLY
THEN BESIDES THE BOATING CLUB WE HAVE OUR BICYCLE CLUBS AND OUR DEBATING SOCIETY AND OUR DRAMATIC SOCIETY
I DO NOT SAY THAT SHE HAS NOT HER USE IN THE WORLD
I CANNOT MAKE OUT WHAT ALL THIS MEANS
I SHALL GIVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME FOR YOUR SAKE MY DEAR SAID MRS ACHESON
MRS CHETWYND COULD NOT HELP FEELING DRAWN TO HER
I DO WONDER WHAT THE OTHER STUDENTS WILL BE LIKE AND WHAT THE TUTORS WILL BE LIKE CONTINUED MARJORIE EAGERLY
HE HAD STOOD CLOSE TO THE BOX--ONCE HIS HAND HAD TOUCHED IT
I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME
IT JUST ENCOURAGES ONE TO BE TERRIBLY IMMORAL IMMORAL
I SHAN'T MIND HELPING THAT POOR GIRL
THERE IS ONE THING CERTAIN
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BUT FORGIVE ME
IT'S GOOD-BY TO DAYDREAMS THAT'S ALL
SHE HATED HERSELF FOR NOT TELLING ANNIE THAT SHE HAD OVERHEARD HER CONVERSATION
YES I HAVE INK ON MY HANDS AND ON MY FACE AND ON MY HAIR
NONE FOR ME HE SAID
THE STOOL HAS NO BACK
IS THE SOUL GOING TO STEEP ITSELF IN LUXURY OR IS IT GOING TO CAST AWAY ALL HINDRANCES AND RUN ITS RACE IN FULLNESS IN POWER
OH YOU ARE THE BEST MAN I KNOW
BUT I BEGGED SO HARD THAT AT LAST SHE GAVE WAY AND HERE I AM WELL
CHAPTER XXII--THE PROMISE
I AM TRULY GLAD IT HAS COME LESLIE SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS
NO ONE IS UNKIND TO A FRESHER UNLESS SHE MAKES HERSELF DISAGREEABLE WHICH I RATHER GUESS YOU WON'T HERE ANNIE SMILED BRIGHTLY INTO LESLIE'S FACE
DON'T YOU KNOW ME SHE SAID
BEING DEAD TIRED SHE SOON DROPPED ASLEEP
IF I TAKE HONORS I SHALL BE LEAVING ST WODE'S
I WAS IN MY USUAL PLACE AT THE OFFICE OF THE GRAPHO TO-DAY SHE BEGAN
WELL YOU ARE HELPING WHEN YOU COME TO SEE ME FOR I DO WANT CHEERING UP DREADFULLY
BUT IF I AM ASKED OF COURSE I MUST MENTION IT
SHE TRIPPED UP SOME WIDE STONE STAIRS DESTITUTE OF CARPETS AND THEN DOWN A CORRIDOR SLIPPERY WITH PARQUETRY WORK
CHAPTER III THE TORN DRESS
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY ABOUT HER ONLY THAT SHE IS QUITE INNOCENT SAID ANNIE
WHO CAN IT POSSIBLY BE THE NEXT MOMENT THE ROOM-DOOR WAS OPENED AND MRS GILROY ACCOMPANIED BY MR PARKER CAME IN
YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT LLEWELLYN IS THE ONE IN THE FAMILY WITH GENIUS
BUT THE ANSWER CAME QUICKLY
HE LITTLE KNOWS WHAT I AM REALLY SUFFERING EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THERE CAME A RING AT THE FRONT DOOR AND WHO SHOULD BE SEEN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD BUT THE WELL-KNOWN FIGURE OF BELLE ACHESON
WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT MY BEING ABSENT AT THE MEETING TO-NIGHT SHE BEGAN
A SUITABLE STANZA OCCURS TO ME
THE DRAWING-ROOM HAD THREE LARGE WINDOWS WITH VENETIAN BLINDS
DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED
I WILL SHOW YOU MY LITTLE BANK SHE JUMPED UP HASTILY UNLOCKED HER DESK AND TAKING OUT A CANVAS BAG POURED THE CONTENTS INTO HER LAP
PETTICOATS FLOPPED ON THE NEAREST CHAIR
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS I TOOK IT OUT SAID LESLIE
HURRAH CRIED EILEEN
ARE YOU CLASSICAL MISS GILROY NO
HE DELVES HE OBTAINS HIS JOY IS UNUTTERABLE BUT I AM NOT IN THE HUMOR FOR POETRY TO-DAY
IT WAS GIVEN YOU TO PAY A DEBT WELL I PAID PART OF IT--NOT ALL
SUCH A STRONG EFFECT DID HE HAVE UPON HER THAT SHE FORGOT HER BELOVED CLASSICS AS SHE LISTENED TO HIM
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND
SHE TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING FOR HER HOW LIBERAL YOU WERE WITH YOUR MONEY HOW VERY KIND
I WOULDN'T PART WITH HER ON ANY ACCOUNT I WILL WRITE A LINE TO MOTHER IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID LESLIE
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BROTHER--IT HAS TO DO WITH ME
OH COME CLOSE LESLIE SHE SAID SUDDENLY STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS
LESLIE WHO HAD HEARD EACH WORD OF THIS CONVERSATION SHRANK UP AGAINST THE HOUSE
DEAR ME MOTHER
WE NEVER GO ON IN THAT WAY AT NORTH HALL
YOU FORGED A LETTER IN MY NAME AND YOU TOOK IT TO MY FRIEND MR PARKER HOW--HOW CAN YOU KNOW SAID ANNIE
LET ME SHOW YOU THE MONEY I HAVE IN MY POCKET SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INTO HER POCKET TOOK OUT HER PURSE AND TUMBLED ITS CONTENTS INTO LESLIE'S LAP
ANNIE COLCHESTER GONE TO LONDON SAID LESLIE STARTING AND TURNING SLIGHTLY PALE
BY THE WAY I WISH THAT YOUNG PERSON--I BEG HER PARDON LETITIA IS MY NAME SAID LETTIE
SHE DID NOT LOOK UP WHEN SHE HEARD THE TWO GIRLS ENTER THE ROOM
LESLIE WAS GLAD TO LEARN WHAT SHE COULD
WHAT A TERRIBLE SCARE YOU HAVE HAD
SHE REACHED THE GROUND FLOOR TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR FOUND THE DOOR LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I HAVE PUT MY THINGS
PRAY DON'T DISTURB ME
AND YET I EXPECTED HIM WITH HIS TALENTS TO LIVE IN A PALACE BY THIS TIME
SHE TURNED AWAY FROM HER FEELING THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY BEAR TO INHABIT THE SAME ROOM
IF THEY CONTAIN ANY SECRETS YOU MAY TRUST ME NOT TO BLAB
THERE WERE TWO OR THREE CANDIDATES STILL WAITING FOR THE VACANT POST OF SECRETARY
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME SHE SAID TURNING TO ANNIE
YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE FEW RULES THAT ARE IMPOSED UPON THE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE KEPT MOST RIGOROUSLY
A MOMENT OR TWO LATER THE GIRLS WENT DOWN TO DINNER TOGETHER
THE HOUSE WILL BE SMALL THE FURNITURE OF THE PLAINEST THE FOOD JUST WHAT IS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN LIFE
I HAVE DINED AND ADMIRABLY
THEY MUST APPEAR AS DEBUTANTES AT THE VERY FIRST DRAWING-ROOM
OH SAY YES HERE AND NOW THEN HERE IS MY HAND ON IT
I DON'T THINK SO
YOU SHALL HELP ME BY AND BY WITH MY DEAR HOSTEL
ERICSON IS GOING TO STAY UP TO-NIGHT WITH YOUR SISTER
WHY DID YOU DO THAT SAID LESLIE
IT IS THE LAST THING I WISH TO BE--THE RECIPIENT OF ANOTHER PERSON'S SECRETS
THE SHABBY SERGE DRESS WHICH MRS CHETWYND CONSIDERED ONLY TO BE FIT FOR THE NEXT BAG SENT FROM THE KILBURN SOCIETY HANGING ON THE BRASS KNOB OF THE BED
BUT HE HINTED VERY BROADLY--AND SO DID THE OLD MAN TOO FOR THAT MATTER--THAT IF I COULD TAKE HIS PLACE IT WOULD PUT MATTERS A BIT RIGHT AND SMOOTH DOWN THE PRIDE OF OLD FORREST
WE SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW HER LESLIE PROMISED TO COME AND THE NEXT MOMENT RAN UP TO HER OWN ROOM
IT IS THE FATE OF THOSE WHO WOULD EXPLORE WHO WOULD DELVE IN THE MINES OF THE PAST TO BRING UP DIAMONDS ALONE
THERE IS NO GOOD IN HAVING AN UNCOMFORTABLE BED
I AM UNHAPPY ABOUT ANNIE COLCHESTER OH MY DEAR SAID JANE IF YOU BEGIN TO FRET ABOUT THE ODDITIES OF THE COLLEGE YOU WILL NEVER KNOW A MOMENT'S PEACE
BY AND BY THE HOUSE GREW QUIET
IF IT WERE ONLY YOUR CHANCE HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE
NOW I HAVE MANAGED SINCE I CAME HERE TO SPEND SOMETHING UNDER FIVE POUNDS A TERM THEREFORE I HAVE ALREADY A NICE LITTLE SUM PUT BY
MABEL PUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TEA INTO THE OLD TEAPOT
I DON'T MIND IN THE LEAST AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WHETHER YOU HATE ME OR NOT
BUT DON'T YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF IT MAMMY
I CAN GIVE YOU ONE OF BACH'S FUGUES IF YOU LIKE DO SO MY DEAR
I WANTED OF COURSE TO LEAD A USEFUL LIFE AND I THOUGHT MYSELF VERY MUCH BETTER THAN MOTHER OR MRS ACHESON
WHEN RUPERT SPOKE TO HER BELLE FOUND HERSELF BLUSHING
THE METAPHOR REFERS TO A MINER THE GOLD IS BENEATH
MY DEAR LETTIE SHE SAID I WOULD HONESTLY PAY TWENTY POUNDS TO ANY HANSOM-DRIVER TO LET HIS HORSE FALL BETWEEN HERE AND MRS ACHESON'S IN ORDER TO GIVE BELLE A WRENCH OF THE ARM OR A TWIST OF THE WRIST OR SOMETHING WHICH WOULD GIVE HER SUFFICIENT PAIN TO SEND HER HOME AGAIN THEN AS THOSE ARE YOUR VERY HEATHENISH WISHES AUNT HELEN YOU MAY BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT BELLE WILL ARRIVE IN PERFECT HEALTH WITHOUT ANY ACCIDENT NOT IN A HANSOM BUT IN THAT TWO-HORSE CONVEYANCE WHICH IS MEANT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE POORER PEOPLE OF LONDON MRS CHETWYND SIGHED
THE SPRING IS BROKEN
A FIRE BLAZING MERRILY GAVE A FINAL TOUCH OF CHEERFULNESS TO THE PLEASANT ROOM
BY THE TIME I HAVE A GREAT BIG SHOP OF MY OWN YOU WILL THINK ME THE WISE ONE OF THE FAMILY
I WAS NEVER TIDY--NO NEVER
BUT IT'S ABOMINABLY HARD
WHY IS HE ABOUT THE MOST WICKED PERSON IN THE WORLD AND WHY DO I LOVE HIM SO MUCH SHE THOUGHT
MR ESSEX WAS IN AND MR PARKER HAD A SHORT EMPHATIC INTERVIEW WITH HIM
STRONG LANGUAGE IS REQUIRED FOR SUCH A TERRIBLE POSSESSION
DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY TEA THIS AFTERNOON SAID ANNIE
BUT THE DEPRESSION WHICH HAD SO OFTEN VISITED HER OF LATE WAS ON THIS AFTERNOON WORSE THAN EVER
THAT WAS A FEW DAYS AGO
I'LL JUST TELL MOTHER RIGHT OUT AND PUT AN END TO THE THING
AND THERE'S LESLIE WHOM ALL THE REST LOOK UP TO AS THE STRAIGHTEST OF THE STRAIGHT AND THE BEST OF THE BEST AND WHO HAS ABOUT THE MOST OPEN FACE I EVER LOOKED INTO
ALL RIGHT SAID LETTIE
HER EYES STARTLED AND ALARMED GLANCED FROM LESLIE TO THE GROUND
AND HOW CAN THEY BE ALL EIGHTEEN AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE NOT THREE DAUGHTERS MY DEAR
THERE I HAVE ONLY FOUR SHILLINGS NOW
EILEEN AND MARJORY HAD FOUND THEIR WAY TO BELLE'S HALL
YOU DISTINCTLY INTEND TO OPPOSE YOUR MOTHER AND THAT YOUNG GIRL WITH THE FASHIONABLE HEAD I REALLY CANNOT SEE WHY I AND MY HEAD SHOULD BE DRAGGED INTO THIS CONTROVERSY SAID LETITIA
I DO WISH WE COULD SAY THAT WE WOULD BE PRESENTED TO HER MAJESTY AND GO INTO SOCIETY SIX EVENINGS OUT OF THE SEVEN
HOW COULD SHE LIVE UNDER THIS TERRIBLE IMPUTATION
I PASSIONATELY LOVE THE CLASSICS RUPERT DROPPED HIS VOICE
THE CLERK WITHDREW
IT WAS A LOVELY SUMMER'S DAY AND REGENT'S PARK LOOKED ITS BEST
BUT ANNIE FOR SOME REASON WHICH SHE DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HERSELF FELT STRANGELY STRONG THAT AFTERNOON
MEND MY DRESS SAID BELLE
THAT I CAN SEE REPLIED MRS ACHESON
SHE STOOPED AND KISSED ANNIE ON HER BROW THEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER OWN BED
THERE IS NO USE IN COAXING ME
WHO LIVES AT NO
CHAPTER II IN A THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGE
THE GIRLS CAME HOME ON WEDNESDAY AND ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY MRS ACHESON AND BELLE WERE COMING TO TEA
SHE WORKED NEATLY BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF FITTING
GOOD-BY OLD GIRL
SHE TOOK UP HER PURSE OPENED IT AND GAVE RUPERT HALF A SOVEREIGN
DOES YOUR MOTHER OBJECT TO YOUR STUDIES SHE SAID
MRS ACHESON HAS HEARD YOU ALREADY
HE GLANCED AT ANNIE IN SOME ANNOYANCE AND SURPRISE AND GAVE LESLIE THAT COLD LEVEL GLANCE WHICH HAD ALMOST BROKEN HER HEART ON THE DAY OF THE PICNIC
A BROTHER MAY BE WICKED AND A SISTER GOOD AND VIRTUOUS YOU THINK HER GOOD AND VIRTUOUS INTERRUPTED THE MERCHANT
BUT I LITTLE THOUGHT TO COME BACK TO SUCH A REWARD AS THIS
WHAT A BRUTE I AM TO GRUDGE IT TO HER
SHE MADE AN EXCUSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
HE HAD BEEN BENDING OVER A VOLUME OF PLATO'S REPUBLIC AND SOME SHEETS OF MANUSCRIPT SCRIBBLED OVER AS IF IN FRANTIC HASTE WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE TABLE
I AM DESPERATE
ARE THOSE THICK CURTAINS NECESSARY--THEY ARE ONLY TRAPS TO COLLECT DIRT
IT NOT ONLY RUINS THE HAIR AND AGES THE APPEARANCE BUT WHAT IS OF MUCH MORE CONSEQUENCE IT CAUSES THE UNHAPPY VICTIM TO COMMIT A SIN--YES A SIN
I'LL PUT OUT YOUR DRESS AND LEAVE EVERYTHING QUITE NICE AND NEAT FOR YOU ANNIE GAZED FULL UP INTO LESLIE'S FACE
NOT AT ALL SHE ANSWERED
I DID COMMIT FORGERY
YOU WON'T LEAVE YOUR BROTHER RUPERT IN A LURCH
BELLE SPOKE EAGERLY AND WELL
I BLAME HER--YES I BLAME HER MOST BITTERLY
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU LESLIE
SHE WAS AWAKENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
I KNOW WHY SHE DID IT
THE MAN DID SO WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
HE TOOK SHARES IN SOME GOLD-MINES AND EXPLAINED TO ME THAT HE IS NOW A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH HE MUST HAVE INTERRUPTED YOUR WORK A GOOD BIT BEGAN LLEWELLYN THEN HE CHECKED HIMSELF
LESLIE LED HER TOWARD THE BED TAKING CARE NOT TO SPEAK
BUT THEN EACH CHILD HAD BEEN TRAINED THOROUGHLY AND EACH CHILD DID HIS OR HER APPOINTED TASK WITHOUT A MURMUR
HASN'T IT PRETTY LITTLE FINGERS
IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD LEARNED NOT ONLY ALL THAT BELLE COULD TELL HIM OF HER OWN COLLEGE LIFE BUT ALSO THE DARLING HOPE OF THE FUTURE
DO LET ME GO AND TELL MISS FRERE
THAT'S MY OPINION
SHE DETERMINED TO GIVE HER A RIGHT GOOD TIME AND TO GET AT THAT SECRET WHICH KNITTED HER DARK BROWS AND MADE HER BEAUTIFUL RED-BROWN EYES SO FULL OF INDESCRIBABLE MELANCHOLY
I CAN FINISH PACKING THEM SAID LESLIE IN A LOW VOICE WHICH SHE HARDLY RECOGNIZED AS HER OWN
NO NUT WAS TOO HARD FOR HER TO CRACK
MY MIND IS ABSORBED IN ABSTRUSE SPECULATIONS AND SUCH TRIVIAL MATTERS AS BODILY DISCOMFORTS CANNOT TOUCH IT
THERE HE ADDED INSTANTLY CHANGING HIS TONE WHEN HE SAW THAT SHE SHIVERED AND SHRANK FROM HIM
MISS LAUDERDALE WAS VERY GOOD TO HER AND SHE HAS GONE OFF IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS
PLEASE DON'T ENGAGE A SECRETARY FINALLY UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT I WANT TO SAY SHE FOLDED UP THE PAPER AND HANDED IT TO THE CLERK
BUT WE SHOULD LIKE TO BE WOMEN WHO HELP THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES WHO ARE READY TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN A SUDDEN EMERGENCY
OH IF ONLY EILEEN AND MARJORIE WERE LIKE LETITIA
SHE LOOKED SORRY ENOUGH BUT NOT SURPRISED--NO NOT SURPRISED
A WOMAN WITH A FRETFUL BABY ON HER KNEE SAT NEAR ONE
I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE HEARD BAD NEWS OF ME SHE DOES NOT LOOK A BIT LIKE IT MUTTERED THE MERCHANT TO HIMSELF AS LESLIE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM
I AM OFF AT ONCE TO MY STUDY
MISS FRERE INTENDS TO SPEAK TO YOU IN THE MORNING
WITH NUMBERLESS BLOUSES HOWEVER AND A COUPLE OF SERGE SKIRTS AND SAILOR HATS THOUGH CHEAP AT LEAST LOOKING CLEAN THE GIRLS PASSED MUSTER AND WERE TOTALLY INDIFFERENT TO THEIR OWN APPEARANCE
I AM WORKING HARD FOR A VERY DEFINITE OBJECT AND NOTHING MUST STAND IN THE WAY OF MY WORK BY THE WAY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE BELLE ACHESON THIS AFTERNOON YES
YOU HAVE MY DECISION CHAPTER XXVIII RUPERT
BUT I WAS OUT SO LONG THIS AFTERNOON THAT I AM HALF-DEAD WITH SLEEP AND I TOO AM VERY SLEEPY SAID ALICE RISING
ANNIE CALLED OUT LESLIE TO HER YOU WILL BE SURE TO BE READY TO GO WITH ME TO EAST HALL THIS EVENING ANNIE MADE NO REPLY
I HAVE A BAD HEADACHE AND SHOULD LIKE TO LIE DOWN OH POOR CHILD SAID MRS ACHESON I DO HOPE YOU ARE NOT SICKENING FOR ANYTHING DEAR
IT REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF TALENT TO TAKE HONORS IN WORK LIKE MINE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ALL RUPERT'S EXPERIENCE THAT HE FOUND HER SO AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE THOROUGHLY RESPECTED HIS SISTER
A QUEER SENSE OF HEARTSICKNESS CAME OVER HER
I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHALL BE IF YOU ARE ASKED SAID ANNIE FROWNING
WHEN THE GIRLS FOUND THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE OPEN AIR NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE
IN THE MIDST OF THESE MEDITATIONS SHE HEARD A RING AT THE FRONT DOOR
I WONDER WHERE YOUR MAID IS HERE SHE TURNED TO THE FOOTMAN WHO WAS STANDING MOTIONLESS IN THE HALL
WHAT IS TO BE DONE THOUGHT THE WRETCHED GIRL
MARJORIE BENT SUDDENLY FORWARD AND LAID HER HAND ON LESLIE'S KNEE
I BELIEVE THE USUAL COURSE IS THREE YEARS SAID LETTIE
SHE LOOKED AT HER SISTER
SHE COULD TAKE IT FROM ME WHEN SHE COULD NOT TAKE IT FROM A STRANGER
HAVE YOU COME ON THAT ACCOUNT YES
AND ALTHOUGH YOUR HOME IS PLAIN ENOUGH YET YOU HAVE NEVER WANTED
SHE TREMBLED AND COLORED
OUGHT I NOT TO GO TO HER SAID LESLIE
THERE I SHALL HATE MYSELF IF I GIVE WAY ANOTHER MOMENT
SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT
I KNOW I WAS BAD BUT I WAS NOT WHOLLY BAD
LET US ASK GOD TO SAVE HER
AFTER ALL THAT MAY BE AS GOOD AN EXCUSE AS ANYTHING ELSE
DO LET ME TRY IT YOU ARE A KIND-HEARTED CREATURE
OH WHAT A COMFORT IT IS TO HAVE SHORT HAIR
THEY MUST STAND OR FALL ON THEIR OWN MERITS
WHEN HE RETURNED HE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO LESLIE
I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY ABOUT YOUR SISTER INDEED REPLIED RUPERT PUTTING ON A SYMPATHETIC AND VERY INTERESTED AIR
LLEWELLYN WATCHED HER
AND I SHALL BE DELIGHTED IF YOUR FRIENDS WILL COME TOO SHE SAID
THE DREAM OF HER LIFE WAS FULFILLED AND EVEN ANNIE COLCHESTER COULD NOT KEEP HER AWAKE
THE FELLOWS WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET TWENTY POUNDS FROM ME
WE ARE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY THESE THINGS I SEE SHE REMARKED
I OFTEN LIE AWAKE UNTIL MORNING
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TROUBLE YOU HAVE GOT INTO NOR DO I WISH TO KNOW
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN WELL I HAVE THE GREATEST DREAD OF BURGLARS BREAKING INTO A HOUSE INHABITED ONLY BY WOMEN OH WE ARE NOT AT ALL AFRAID REPLIED BELLE
AS SOON AS THEY SAW LESLIE THEY TURNED TO SPEAK TO HER
I NOTICED THAT SHE WAS STANDING BY THE DOOR WHEN THE PRINCIPAL SOUNDED THE GONG ALL THE SAME SHE DOES NOT ALWAYS HEAR WHAT IS SAID REPLIED LESLIE
AREN'T YOU COMING ANNIE SHE CALLED OUT
MAY I ASK LETITIA SAID MRS CHETWYND WHEN THIS MADNESS SEIZED MARJORIE AND EILEEN IT HAS BEEN COMING ON GRADUALLY SAID LETITIA
I'LL CUT IT OFF CUT IT OFF CRIED MRS CHETWYND
THE TEA WHEN IT WAS READY CONSISTED OF FRESH EGGS HONEY IN THE COMB HOT CAKES WHICH MABEL HAD BEEN SECRETLY WATCHING FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR A PILE OF BUTTERED TOAST BREAD BOTH BROWN AND WHITE DELICIOUS COUNTRY BUTTER TEA AND EVEN CREAM
LET MOTHER THINK THAT I AM COMING WITH YOU
NOT THAT I KNOW ANY WAY OF REALLY HELPING HER
I HAVE BEEN OF COURSE IN CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THEIR INVALUABLE TEACHER MRS MARCHLAND AND HAVE HAD FREQUENT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CHILDREN
BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY HER LETTER IT WAS YOUR PLEADING WHICH INDUCED ME TO GIVE IT
AND LESLIE AND ANNIE WENT UPSTAIRS ONCE MORE TO THEIR OWN ROOM
YOU RAN IN DEBT FOR FAL-LALS AND GEW-GAWS AND ALL THE OTHER SORT OF THINGS WHICH PLEASE PRETTY GIRLS
I HAVE MY ECCENTRICITIES--I OWN TO THE FACT--AND I WILL CLING TO THEM THROUGH THICK AND THIN
NEVER AGAIN COULD SHE BE HAPPY
BUT NOW DO COME DOWN TO MY ROOM AND HAVE A CHAT
BUT HE IS VERY GOOD TO ME--MORE THAN GOOD
YOU CAN PASTE ANY PICTURES YOU LIKE ON IT IF YOU ARE GIVEN THAT WAY
YOU CAN SCARCELY KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN SHE SAID LOOKING AT ANNIE
I JUST HAPPENED TO MENTION THAT LESLIE HAD CALLED AND MARJORIE SAID AT ONCE SHE MUST SEE HER THAT NO ONE IN ALL THE WORLD COULD DO HER SO MUCH GOOD
YOUR SPLENDID THOUGHT AND IT HAS SUCCEEDED
SHE HAD A LONG UPPER LIP AND HER MOUTH WAS THIN AND WIDE
YOU ALLOWED HER
NOW MARJORIE AND EILEEN RUB ME THE WRONG WAY EVERY TIME THEY OPEN THEIR LIPS AND YET I LOVE THEM WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL
WHAT WAS HE TO DO
OH IN ONE SENSE IT IS YOUNG
WE LEAVE OUT WHAT HAS MADE WOMAN NOBLE AND GREAT IN THE PAST
SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH EMPHASIS AND SPIRIT BUT NEVER IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HER LIFE HAD SHE FELT SO COLD SO BITTER
YOU CANNOT SAY THAT WE DO NOT DEVELOP THE BODIES OF OUR LADS AS LONG AS WE HAVE FOOTBALL AND CRICKET WE HAVE THOSE TOO IN AUSTRALIA AND WE MANAGE TO BEAT YOU ONCE IN A WHILE SAID PARKER WITH A SLIGHT TWINKLE IN HIS EYES
I DIDN'T WISH TO
I DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE EITHER OF YOU UNTIL THIS EVENING
WILL YOU TELL ME SOMETHING SHE ASKED EARNESTLY
HERE THEY WERE SUPPLIED WITH LIGHT REFRESHMENTS AND PRESENTLY MISS LAUDERDALE HERSELF WENT TO THE ORGAN AT THE END OF THE ROOM AND PLAYED SOME SPLENDID MUSIC
FOR GOODNESS SAKE GET IN AS LETITIA SPOKE SHE GAVE HER ENERGETIC COUSIN A PUSH
WHERE IS LITTLE DAN
SHE NEVER LOVED ANYONE IN ALL THE WORLD AS SHE LOVED ME
I CANNOT TELL YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW ALREADY WHAT I KNOW ALREADY IS NOT THE TRUTH
YOU CANNOT BE ANGRY WITH HER ANY LONGER
MOST OF THE CAPITALS WERE FORMED IN THE SAME WAY BUT THERE WAS ALSO A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE
THERE HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL SIR
I AM DELIGHTED YOU ARE HERE
HE HAD BEEN CALLED UNEXPECTEDLY OUT OF TOWN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY OR EVENTS WOULD HAVE COME TO AN ISSUE BEFORE NOW
I MUST GET YOU SOME SAL-VOLATILE AT ONCE MRS ACHESON DRAGGED ANNIE UPSTAIRS THEN WENT TO THE SERVANTS AWOKE THEM AND SENT TWO OF THEM OFF IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST POLICE-STATION
HOW CAN I HELP IT CHILD
THERE'S MOTHER'S STEP AT LAST
YOU HAVE ONLY TO NAME IT
AND TO YOU TOO MISS GILROY
IT IS QUITE UNNECESSARY TO AWAKEN POOR MRS CHETWYND TO TELL HER THIS
A FELT HAT FOR WINTER AND A SAILOR ONE FOR SUMMER AND NO MORE
IT'S DONE AND THAT'S AN END OF IT BUT YOU MUST LET ME SPEAK SAID LESLIE
HE WOULD WALK IN THE BROAD WALK IN REGENT'S PARK THAT AFTERNOON AND IF ANNIE AND BELLE DID NOT APPEAR WOULD GO BOLDLY TO THE HOUSE IN NEWBOLT SQUARE
BUT PLAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU ATTEMPT TO ASK BELLE ACHESON TO LEND YOU ANY MONEY I SHALL IMMEDIATELY TELL THE ENTIRE TRUTH TO MRS ACHESON I BELIEVE YOU
IF HE KEEPS HIS PROMISE TO YOU I MUST NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
BUSTLE AWAY GET THE HOUSE INTO PERFECT ORDER AND THEN YOU SHALL COME DOWN TO HEAR MY GOOD NEWS THE CHILDREN RAN OFF
FOR I KNOW YOU ARE A ST WODE'S GIRL SHE SAID
IT MAY NOT BE SAID ANNIE IN A WHISPER WHICH NEARLY CHOKED HER
THE SERVANTS WERE FAR AWAY
GIRLS DON'T DIE AS QUICKLY AS ALL THAT
I AM DESPERATE SO YOU HAD BEST LEAVE ME ALONE
YES TO-MORROW AT AN EARLY HOUR MADAME CORAY SHOULD PUT THEIR PRESENTATION DRESSES IN HAND
OH DEAR ME NO MOTHER
BUT MOTHER'S OUT I AM AFRAID MR PARKER
HE SPOKE TO ME MOST FRANKLY AND FINALLY ENDED BY MAKING ME AN OFFER
BELLE ADJUSTED HER SPECTACLES AND LOOKED FULL AT LESLIE OUT OF HER SHORT-SIGHTED EYES
SHE WAS TERRIBLY TEMPTED
AND AFTERWARDS YOU MUST COME TO HALL
WHERE WAS SHE TO GO
TELL YOUR FRIEND THAT YOU HAVE FAILED AND THAT THE FAULT IS YOURS LESLIE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM
FROM EILEEN OR MARJORIE THE WORDS YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED WOULD DISGUST ME SO COMPLETELY THAT I SHOULD ASK THE ONE WHO HAD SO SPOKEN TO LEAVE THE ROOM
I WILL GO BACK NOW AND SEE HER WITHOUT DELAY CHAPTER XIX THE MAN BY THE RUIN
IT WAS THAT OF A HOME WITH A WOMAN IN IT WHO WORE THE SWEETEST FACE IN THE WORLD AND WHO WAS NOT TIRED WITH OVERWORK WHO IN FACT NEED NOT WORK AT ALL
I AM GOING TO BED
NOW MR PARKER WANTS A SECRETARY
HER ONE DESIRE--THE ONLY DESIRE THAT SHE HAD AT THAT MOMENT--WAS NOT TO TELL BUT TO HIDE THE TRUTH
IF YOU AND I ARE TO BE FRIENDS YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO SPEAK OUT QUITE FRANKLY
WHEN DINNER WAS OVER ONE OR TWO GIRLS CAME UP TO INVITE BOTH ANNIE AND LESLIE TO JOIN THEM AT A COCOA-PARTY
MY DEAR EILEEN
THERE WAS A BREAK IN HER VOICE
WILL YOU COME WITH US I SHALL BE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED WAS THE REPLY
MY WORK WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE BUSY WORLD--NOT IN ANY HERMITAGE
THIS YOUNG LADY NOW SHE'S MY CHARGE FOR THE FUTURE
OH THAT'S ALL EASY ENOUGH SAID MR PARKER
MOTHER MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD COME BACK FROM SCHOOL AND THAT YOUR MOTHER INTENDED TO TAKE YOU AT ONCE INTO THAT WHIRLPOOL OF FRIVOLITY WHICH IS GIVEN THE NAME OF SOCIETY
SHE NOW FELT HERSELF TURNING PALE
I GAVE IT TO RUPERT BUT EVEN NOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SAID MR PARKER
I WILL BE BRAVE NOW
OH JUST A LITTLE VERY LITTLE
I HAVE READ HERODOTUS AND THOUGHT IT SPLENDID
ANNIE KNEW HER BROTHER QUITE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO BE CERTAIN THAT BELLE'S MANNERS HER ATTACHMENT TO THE CLASSICS HER WHOLE STYLE WOULD BE THE VERY LAST THAT RUPERT IN EASIER MOMENTS OF HIS CAREER WOULD HAVE DEIGNED TO NOTICE
SHE WAS NOT NATURALLY SUSPICIOUS
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON YOUR DISCRETION I WILL DO WHAT I CAN OF COURSE AUNT HELEN
SHE DID THIS SOFTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY AS SHE HAD DONE OFTEN AND OFTEN FOR LLEWELLYN WHEN HE WAS IN HIS FITS OF LITERARY DESPAIR
WE ARE NOT A BIT ASHAMED OF OUR DRESSES
YOU DO LOOK A BIT DRAGGED ANNIE NOW I COME TO EXAMINE YOU CAREFULLY
I SHALL COME TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY
AND YET MY DEAR THEY ARE THE REVERSE OF FASHIONABLE OH AUNT HELEN I THINK FASHIONABLE WOMEN ARE GOING OUT GOING OUT MY DEAR
I AM VERY PLEASED THAT BELLE HAS ASKED YOU TO STAY WITH US
THE THREE ROOMS WERE ON THE SAME LANDING AND COMMUNICATED ONE WITH THE OTHER
BUT THE MOTHER MUST COME ROUND WITH ME TO SEE HIM TO-MORROW
LESLIE WENT UP AND TRIED TO PUT HER ARM ROUND HER WAIST
THAT I CANNOT DO BUT YOU MUST
THE GIRLS WISH TO ENTER ST WODE'S
GOOD LOOKS ARE A GREAT GIFT
RUPERT WANTED SIXTY POUNDS
HIS MOTHER GLANCED AT HIM NOTICED WITHOUT REALLY NOTICING IT THE MARKED LOOK OF POWER ON HIS INTELLECTUAL FACE AND THEN TURNED TO HER FAVORITE CHILD
BUT NOW MY CREDITORS ARE CLAMORING FOR THE SECOND INSTALMENT
SHE COLORED AND FOR A MOMENT FELT SLIGHTLY ALARMED
THEY WOULD PLAY AND WOULD NOT LEARN
IN A MASTERLY WAY THE AUTHOR HAS GRASPED THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT OF THE GREAT CITY BY THE LAKES
MR PARKER OPENLY TALKS OF HER AS HIS ADOPTED DAUGHTER AND HER LOVE FOR THE OLD MAN IS THE SUNSHINE OF HIS DECLINING YEARS
DEAR LOVELY CHILD I SURELY SHALL BE ABLE TO MOLD HER TO MY WISHES SHE THOUGHT
I AM TAKING IT A RATTLE AND SOME CHOCOLATES YOU WILL KILL A YOUNG INFANT IF YOU GIVE IT CHOCOLATE SAID MRS CHETWYND AND I FORBID YOU TO GO TO FOX BUILDINGS
I AM A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT ANNIE COLCHESTER THAT QUEER RED-HAIRED GIRL
BUT AS IT IS AND AS HE IS SACRIFICING HIMSELF OH
ACCORDINGLY MRS CHETWYND IMPLORED LESLIE TO REMAIN WITH THEM
BUT THE FACT IS I WAS SO WORRIED I SCARCELY KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING
BEFORE HE COULD DECIDE ANYTHING THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL DEAR SHE SAID
HAVE YOU NOTHING MORE TO SAY BELLE CRIED MARJORIE
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE AND RIGHT FOR YOU TO TAKE HELP FROM MR PARKER
I AM DEAD TIRED CHAPTER XXVI ANNIE'S REQUEST
IF THE GIRLS HAVE NOT ALREADY PASSED SOME PUBLIC EXAMINATION THEY MUST PASS RESPONSIONS
WHEN THE YOUNGER GIRLS HAD RATHER UNWILLINGLY LEFT THE ROOM LESLIE TOOK A SEAT NEAR HER MOTHER
SHE IS OF COURSE ONE OF THE GREAT ADMIRATIONS OF MY LIFE
SHE AND MARJORIE ARE STILL AT ST WODE'S AND MARJORIE NEVER FORGETS THAT TIME WHEN GOD ANSWERED HER PRAYER AND SPARED EILEEN'S LIFE
WE WILL FIND OUT ABOUT VIRGIL AND HOMER AND DANTE PRESENTLY
THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
THAT WE CANNOT PERMIT TO BE SPENT IN SUCH WILLFUL WASTE
I AM GOING TO WORK A LITTLE BIT AT LITERATURE A LITTLE BIT AT LITERATURE
AFTER ALL THERE ALWAYS WAS AN EXCEPTION--ALWAYS ALWAYS
SHE WOULD INDEED HAVE CONSIDERED HER CUP OF HAPPINESS COMPLETE HAD SUCH A GIRL AS LESLIE GILROY BEEN HERS
NOT SO RESTLESS NOR SO UNCERTAIN LESLIE KISSED HER
IF YOU GO I SHALL GO
BUT AS TO YOU LETTIE IT IS THE GREATEST PITY YOU ARE NOT MOTHER'S OWN DAUGHTER
LETITIA DREW IN HER OWN NEATLY SHOD LITTLE FOOT AND SAT WITH HER HANDS FOLDED IN HER LAP AND HER EYES DANCING WITH SUPPRESSED MIRTH
YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
ERICSON IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME I'LL GO IN AND SEE THAT YOUNG LADY OH HOW KIND OF YOU SAID LESLIE
PRAY DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME AGAIN
THIS IS THE MOST BITTER MOMENT OF MY LIFE
LESLIE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO EILEEN MARJORIE WILL DIE BUT SURELY LETTIE EILEEN CANNOT BE SO BAD AS ALL THAT SHE IS VERY BAD INDEED I CAN TELL YOU
I ALWAYS FEEL AS IF I COULD PRAY BETTER IN A CHURCH YES
SHE IS OUR CLASSICAL TUTOR
THE LOOK OF PEACE WHICH HAD DAWNED UPON HER WORN AND ANXIOUS FACE LEFT IT
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF MONEY IF YOU CANNOT HAVE A TREAT BUT YOU DO FAR TOO MUCH FOR US MR PARKER REPLIED MRS GILROY
BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES
WHO WOULD BURGLE HERE
THEN I CANNOT HELP IT HE SAID
THIS CHANCE OUGHT TO BE LLEWELLYN'S
JANE CAME UP
HE TOOK UP A PAIR OF LIGHT SCULLS AND ROWED SWIFTLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BOAT-HOUSE
THERE IS A SMALL DEAL TABLE UPON WHICH I NEVER ALLOW A CLOTH TO BE PUT AS IT IS APT TO COME OFF AND SPILL THE INK--SUCH WASTE OF TIME SOPPING UP INK
THAT IS YOUR TABLE AND THAT IS YOUR CHEST OF DRAWERS
AND OH WHAT A SWEET LITTLE SILVER SPOON
I MEAN BOLDLY TO SECURE FORTY POUNDS OUT OF HER WOODEN BOX
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVE FOR STUDY HAS GONE
THE ROOM WAS IN DARKNESS
YES LESLIE I SHALL SLEEP TO-NIGHT
I HAVE BEEN ENDURING THE TORTURES OF A DRAUGHT FOR THE LAST HOUR AND HAVE LATELY BEEN SUFFERING FROM NEURALGIA OH YOU POOR THING SAID LESLIE PENITENT AT ONCE WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME SO OR SHE ADDED WHY DID YOU NOT SHUT YOUR OWN WINDOW BECAUSE I REQUIRE FRESH AIR SAID ANNIE WITH THAT UTTER SELFISHNESS WHICH HAD CHARACTERIZED HER BEFORE LESLIE CAME AND WHICH HAD BEEN GROWING A LITTLE BETTER LATELY
IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW SHE MOVED AWAY LOOKING SULKY AND WRETCHED
YOU GAVE ME THE MONEY
SHE FELT STUNNED
THAT'S FARE AFTER MY OWN HEART
SHE COULD NOT WELL STAY IN THE CORRIDOR ALL NIGHT
I ONLY WISH YOU COULD MEET HER
AND REMEMBER IF YOU WANT ANYTHING AT ANY TIME I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO HELP YOU
I AM THE LAST MAN LESLIE TO UPHOLD YOUNG RASCALS OF THAT SORT
EVEN THE WORST SINNER OUGHT TO BE FORGIVEN WHEN HE CONFESSES
MRS CHETWYND SUDDENLY ROSE
NO WINE FOR ME THANKS HE SAID
DID I NOT READ IT IN THEIR FACES
LESLIE SAT MOTIONLESS BEARING THE WEIGHT OF THE TIRED GIRL'S HEAD ON HER SHOULDER
OH I SEE THEY HAVE JOINED BELLE ACHESON
MISS GILROY WHATEVER HAPPENS I CANNOT BUT BE MYSELF AS SHE SPOKE SHE STARTED FORWARD AND LAID ONE OF HER VERY THIN LARGE ANGULAR HANDS ON LESLIE'S ARM
OH LLEWELLYN ARE YOU MAD CRIED LESLIE
THAT YOUNG LADY WAS IN AND RECEIVED HER WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF GRACIOUSNESS
SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE EDGE OF HER BED HER HEAD ACHED SHE FELT A NEW SENSE OF FEAR
BUT I WISH SHE ADDED YOU WOULD TALK MORE ABOUT IT
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HUMILIATING AT ALL
THAT IS ALL I POSSESS ABSOLUTELY ALL AND I HAVE NOT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD
AND ANNIE WILL NEVER MISS IT
BY THE WAY DID I EVER MENTION TO YOU--NO I DON'T THINK I DID--THAT I AM STARTING A LITTLE HOSTEL OF MY OWN THAT I AM SAVING MONEY FOR IT
BUT I AM GOING TO TEMPT YOU
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT EGO FOR THE PRESENT
HOW GOOD IT IS TO HAVE A WHOLE AFTERNOON'S REAL REST SHE SAID
THERE WAS NO ANSWER OF ANY SORT
IS HE IN MR PARKER IS IN MISS WAS THE REPLY
A MOST ENTERTAINING AND DELIGHTFUL BOOK
YOU SAID LESLIE THAT IF IT WERE GOOD FOR HER GOD WOULD SPARE HER AND HE WILL MARJORIE
YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME THAN WITH ME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IF I GO WITHOUT THE MONEY WHAT SAID ANNIE IN A LOW TERRIFIED VOICE
WHO CAN SHE BE ASKED LESLIE
MCTEAGUE
ANNIE HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE HER APPEARANCE
MR FORREST SAID IT WOULD DO HIM A LOT OF GOOD TO HAVE A LAD LIKE ME ABOUT THE PLACE
THEY SAY TOO THAT YOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER AND YET YOU HAVE NO JEALOUSIES AND NO SMALLNESSES IN YOU
JUST THINK WHAT IT WOULD MEAN
YES I MUST INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND I DON'T WANT THE MOTHER TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL I CAN FEEL MY BEARINGS
EAT WHEN ALL THAT MAKES LIFE VALUABLE HANGS IN THE BALANCE BUT YOU MUST EAT DEAR SAID LESLIE
BUT DURING THE FEW MOMENTS THAT I CAN SPARE FROM MY OWN HEAVY TASKS FOR I HAVE A VAST DEAL TO ACQUIRE BEFORE I RETURN TO COLLEGE I SURELY MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT I HAVE COME TO SAY SO GOOD OF YOU TO COME DEAR BELLE SAID EILEEN PATTING BELLE'S LONG LARGE ANGULAR HAND
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR FATHER AND OUR OLD FRIENDSHIP I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH LESLIE GILROY
SHE SAYS IF YOU ARE AT ALL TIRED SHE WOULD LIKE YOU TO STAY IN BED FOR BREAKFAST OH NO I AM QUITE REFRESHED
HE MADE NO CONDITION AND YOU--YOU WILL BE RESTORED TO HIS FAVOR I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY REPLIED LESLIE SOMEWHAT PROUDLY
SAVE YOUR FRIEND IF YOU CAN
YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY INTOLERABLE SAID BELLE
HE IS QUITE A GENTLEMAN SHE CONTINUED THOUGH A LITTLE ROUGH
YOU MUST LET ME HAVE MY OWN WAY NOW WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE
MY ROOM IS DISGRACEFULLY BARE
IS THAT CARPET ESSENTIAL
I MUST TRY AND EXPLAIN
AFTER BREAKFAST SHE PROPOSED TO ANNIE THAT THEY SHOULD SPEND THE MORNING AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM
BUT ON A CONDITION OH I WILL PROMISE ANYTHING I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU STOP A MOMENT YOUNG LADY
DO YOU MEAN SAID LESLIE TURNING PALE THAT THERE IS DANGER DON'T ASK ME SAID THE NURSE
YOU ARE TO BE MY HOME-BIRD DARLING THEN HESTER ROSE AND KNELT BY HER MOTHER AND PUT HER STRONG YOUNG ARMS ROUND HER WAIST AND KISSED HER
WON'T WE DEAR SAID MRS ACHESON
NOW TELL ME WHAT DID THAT AWFUL GIRL SAY TO THE CHILDREN HERE ARE THE CHILDREN COMING DOWN TO ANSWER FOR THEMSELVES SAID MARJORIE SPRINGING LIGHTLY INTO THE ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY EILEEN
YOUNG SIR DON'T YOU BE IMPATIENT
MOTHER'S COME SAID LLEWELLYN
SHE ASKED IF WE HAD ANY MESSAGES LESLIE SAID NOTHING MORE
SHE THEN LEFT HER TO ENJOY HER TEA
OH AND DO LOOK AT THOSE GREAT ROOMY CUPBOARDS IN THE WALL BUT WHAT DO WE WANT GREAT ROOMY CUPBOARDS FOR CRIED EILEEN
AUNT HELEN SAYS WE ARE NONE OF US TO GO UPSTAIRS
WHAT HAS COME TO ME SHE THOUGHT
CHAPTER XXIX--30 NEWBOLT SQUARE
HOW HOT YOU LOOK
I WANT TO ORDER MY THINGS MUST YOU ORDER THEM TO-DAY OF COURSE I MUST
THAT YOU KNOW IS YOUR AMBITION YOUR GREAT PASSIONATE AMBITION LITTLE MOTHER NOTHING OF THE KIND AT PRESENT LEW DEAR
BUT WHY MY LAD OH LLEWELLYN WHY SAID THE MOTHER
NOW IF YOU WILL DO SOMETHING IF YOU WILL GRANT ME A GREAT GREAT FAVOR I SHALL BE THE HAPPIEST OF GIRLS
EXCITING INCIDENTS DEVELOP THEIR INHERENT STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS AND IF VIRTUE WINS IN THE END IT IS QUITE IN KEEPING WITH ITS CAREFULLY-PLANNED ANTECEDENTS
WE DON'T DEBATE BEFORE HALF-PAST EIGHT
BUT I COULD NOT--HOW COULD I WITHOUT RUINING RUPERT YOU CONSCIENCE HAS BECOME VERY TENDER SINCE THEN SAID MR PARKER
BUT THE PAIR OF YOU MAKE ME FEEL QUITE NERVOUS
BY THE WAY HAVE YOU SEEN MISS GILROY THIS MORNING TWO OR THREE TIMES
BUT THE OPPRESSION AND SOLEMNITY OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT INTO THE AIR
ANNIE NOW OBSERVED WITH INCREASED APPREHENSION THAT THE BLIND TO THIS WINDOW WAS UP
CHAPTER VI--BELLE THE SAGE
WHEN THE DRESSES ARE COMPLETELY WORN OUT THEY CAN BE GIVEN TO THE POOR--WHO MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE SOMETHING OF THEM--AND WE CAN BUY A COUPLE OF NEW ONES
YOU TOLD ME IN IT THAT YOU PARTICULARLY WISHED TO GET THE MONEY IN NOTES AND GOLD
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU MEAN NOTHING LOVE
ALL THE PROVISIONS WERE PACKED
WE MET HER TWO HOURS AGO ON HER WAY TO THE STATION
MRS CHETWYND PERCEIVED AT A GLANCE THAT IF SHE WAS TO MOLD THESE TWO GIRLS TO HER WAYS OF THINKING SHE WOULD HAVE A TROUBLESOME TASK BEFORE HER
YOU KNOW WHATEVER WE DO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BUT THIS TERRIBLE AWFUL BLOW HAS NEARLY KILLED ME HUMBUG
NO MANNERS DISGRACEFUL IN APPEARANCE AND NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS
YOU HAD CHEEK REPEATED COLCHESTER
WHAT DID OCCUR
I WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH--I WILL GIVE YOUR FRIEND THAT POST--IF YOU WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH WITH REGARD TO THAT SIXTY POUNDS LESLIE TURNED FROM WHITE TO RED
SHE WAS MET IN THE HALL BY LETTIE
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO DO BEFORE THE HONOR EXAMINATION I DO NOT MEAN TO STUDY ANY MORE
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR PERHAPS
SHE HAS DONE IT
I SHOULD THINK THE THREE WOULD MAKE SOMETHING OF A SENSATION
UNDERWOOD
WE HAVE A FEW ODDITIES HERE OF COURSE
A QUEER SENSE OF COMING DANGER AND CALAMITY OPPRESSED HER
THE MOON WAS SHINING FULL UPON HER FACE WHICH LOOKED CLEAR AND PALE AND UNEARTHLY
AND LESLIE KNEELING BY HER LITTLE BED TRIED TO PRAY
THAT ECONOMY ADDED THREE POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS TO MY HOARD
MOTHER IS ILL OR LLEWELLYN OR ONE OF THE GIRLS
BUT THEN I AM COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING AN IGNORANT WOMAN
IT WAS YOUR THOUGHT LESLIE
BUT THEY WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN BY THEIR MOTHER
BECAUSE IF OTHER GIRLS INVITE YOU TO TEA YOU MUST RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
IT WILL BE TROUBLESOME SHE SAID SLOWLY AND WE WOULD MUCH RATHER NOT BE TROUBLESOME
YES I SOMETIMES DO
EXCELLENT SHE SAID
NOW WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU IN THE ROOM
AND WHEN WE BOTH LEFT SCHOOL AND GILROY WAS GOING TO ONE OF YOUR FINE UNIVERSITIES AND I WAS OFF TO THE COLONIES WE HAD A SUPPER TOGETHER AND AT THE END OF THE SUPPER WE MADE A BARGAIN ONE WITH THE OTHER
YES AFTER ALL THREE YOUNG DEBUTANTES WILL IN ONE SENSE BE AN ADVANTAGE
OUR IDEA WAS TO BE JUST USEFUL PLAIN SORT OF WOMEN
I HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AND THE MEMORY OF MY DEAR HUSBAND'S BRILLIANT CAREER WILL ALWAYS BE A COMFORT TO ME
FOR WHEN ONCE WE TAKE UP OUR WORK IN EARNEST WE SHALL HAVE NO TIME FOR SOCIAL FRIVOLITIES SOCIAL FRIVOLITIES REPEATED JANE
NOW GIRLS IF YOU WISH TO HEAR WHAT THE BUSY BEES DO I WILL TELL YOU I WISH YOU WOULD BEGIN SAID LETTIE
ANNIE SHIVERED
SHE WENT UP TO LESLIE AND KISSED HER
THEY WERE NEITHER CRACKED NOR BROKEN BECAUSE THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WASHED THEM AND LOOKED AFTER THEM AND PUT THEM AWAY IN THE LITTLE PANTRY
LESLIE DID NOT LIKE ASKING YOU
OF COURSE THEY WOULD DO SPLENDIDLY YET
SHE WAS ALONE IN THE ROOM WHEN THE YOUNG MAN HAPPENED TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
WELL DEAR OLD GIRL WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE ABOUT HER
THAT IS YOUR SCREEN--YOU CAN TAKE THE BEST OF THE TWO BECAUSE I NEVER OPEN MINE
IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT EACH HUMAN BEING SHOULD HAVE HIS OR HER MODICUM OF FOOD
SHE WILL BEGIN TO FUSS OVER YOU AND THEN YOU WILL IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF THINGS
HOWEVER IT IS NOT YOUR COLORING NOR THE SIZE OF YOUR MOUTH NOR THE SHAPE OF YOUR FACE WHICH SPECIALLY STRIKES ME
IT IS THE SOUL THAT LIVES FOREVER
THIS DOOR IS LOCKED AND I AM AFRAID MISS COLCHESTER HAS GONE TO BED AND FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME
I WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT
BEHIND THIS SCREEN YOU WILL KEEP YOUR WASHHAND-STAND
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU AT ONCE
BELLE THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE GENIUS WHEN SHE SAW IT CLAPPED HER HANDS WITH PLEASURE
THERE WILL BE MORE GIRLS LIKE US YEAR AFTER YEAR
LESLIE ALSO ROSE SHOOK OUT HER DRESS PUT ON A FRESH TIE AND COLLAR AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR
WE ARE ONLY JUST EIGHTEEN WE WILL TALK OF THAT ALSO BY AND BY REPLIED MRS CHETWYND A FROWN KNITTING HER BROWS AND HER HEART SINKING A TRIFLE
CAN'T YOU SPEAK CAN'T YOU SHOW THESE INSUBORDINATE WICKED GIRLS HOW DREADFULLY THEY ARE ACTING IT IS USELESS SAID LETTIE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS
I WILL RUB YOUR FEET AND MAKE THEM WARM IF YOU WILL LET ME AND IF I PUT A HANDKERCHIEF WRUNG OUT OF WATER TO YOUR HEAD THE HEAT WILL SOON LEAVE IT
YOU WILL BE QUITE READY THEN WON'T YOU ANNIE DEAR
I SHALL GET SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOU TO-MORROW
DO LET US ORDER OUR LIVES IN OUR OWN WAY--DO MAMMY DO I MUST KNOW FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS YOUR OWN WAY WE WANT TO BE USEFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND TO SPEND SCARCELY ANY MONEY ON CLOTHES
ANYTHING SO THAT WE GET TO HIM AT ONCE
YOU SHALL COME AND JOIN ME BY AND BY.--GOOD-BY MRS ACHESON
THEY WILL NEVER BE MARRIED LETTIE
IF MR PARKER REALLY SHOWED HER THAT LETTER WRITTEN BY ANNIE BUT SIGNED IN HER NAME SHE KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT TRUST HERSELF SHE KNEW THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HER MISERABLE FRIEND
MY DARLINGS HERE YOU ARE AT LAST SHE CRIED
HE DROPPED IT NOW IN HIS AGITATION
TELL ME HOW YOU FURNISH YOUR ROOM BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT SAID LESLIE
THINK WHAT THE DISGRACE WILL MEAN TO YOU OH RUPERT RUPERT IT WOULD KILL ME MOANED THE POOR GIRL
HOW CAN YOU CONTEMPLATE ANYTHING SO APPALLING BUT I DO CONTEMPLATE IT SAID MRS CHETWYND AND I BELIEVE I SHALL MANAGE VERY WELL
OH I AM NOT GOING TO BE AFRAID OF YOU MR PARKER
SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO THE OLD COACHMAN AS SHE SPOKE
IT IS SHORTER AND MORE CONVENIENT
NO WE WILL HAVE A CARRIAGE AND I WILL DRIVE YOU DOWN
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE DEAR GIRL SHE IS VERY FAR FROM WELL
THE CAB PRESENTLY DELIVERED UP ITS FOUR OCCUPANTS AND EILEEN MARJORIE AND LESLIE FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SMALL WAITING ROOM INSIDE WEST HALL WHERE THEY WERE TO REMAIN UNTIL THE HOUSEKEEPER COULD ARRIVE TO TAKE THEM TO THEIR SEVERAL ROOMS
SHE SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER AND BEGAN TO SPEAK
NOTHING FROM YOU SIR WAS LLEWELLYN'S ANSWER
YOU ONLY SPOKE OF COINS COINS OF THE REALM SAID BELLE WITH A LAUGH
AND OH MR PARKER LAST NIGHT HE BROKE INTO THE VERY HOUSE WHERE I WAS STAYING IN ORDER TO STEAL SOME MONEY WHICH WAS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED--EILEEN SO TERRIBLY ILL JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ROOM DOOR WAS OPENED AND MRS CHETWYND ENTERED
COME BACK TO ME WHEN HE HAS GONE AND BE QUICK
I TOOK IT BACK
IN HER SHABBY SERGE DRESS THE MARKS OF TEARS STILL ROUND HER EYES HER CHEEKS FLUSHED HER SHORT HAIR TOSSED MARJORIE CHETWYND RAN DOWNSTAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY LESLIE
BUT NOT MINE THANK GOODNESS NOR MINE EITHER ECHOED MARJORIE
NONE OF US CAN MAKE HER OUT AND THE DOCTORS ARE TERRIBLY ANNOYED WITH HER
I CAN DO WITHOUT THE UNIVERSITY TRAINING
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU MANAGED TO FURNISH IT IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY WAY BEGAN EILEEN
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU SHE SAID
JUST LIKE THE REST
NOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE SO IT IS A GREAT RELIEF TO ME
ALL THE YOUNG UNS ARE DOING WELL AND YOUR MOTHER LOOKS IF I MAY USE THE WORD BLOOMING
WHAT IS WRONG I HAVE HAD A FRIGHT REPLIED ANNIE
IT IS NOT TOO LATE YET
OH I SHALL MAKE MY ROOM PERFECTLY SWEET
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER WITH THIS SERVICEABLE DRESS
YES I SUPPOSE I HAD BEST HOOK IT STEPS WERE NOW HEARD COMING DOWNSTAIRS
YOU HAVE BEEN TOSSED ABOUT IN A SORE BATTLE
TO BED WITH THIS HEAD OF MINE
MISS LESLIE I WANT YOU TO CONFIDE IN ME
BELLE OPENED THE DOOR AND THEN STOOD SOMEWHAT CROSSLY WAITING FOR MRS ACHESON TO SPEAK
WE ALWAYS CALL THE NEW GIRLS FRESHERS
I HAD A GOOD DAY IN TOWN SHE EXCLAIMED
LET US PONDER THE WORDS
OH BY THE WAY WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME THE TRUTH
I HAVE EXAMINED THE FRONTAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THE TWO GIRLS AND I AM GLAD TO TELL YOU THAT THEY BOTH SHOW MARKED INTELLECTUALITY
WHEN LESLIE APPROACHED HE PUSHED THE MANUSCRIPT HELTER-SKELTER INTO A WASTE-PAPER BASKET AND SHUT UP THE BOOK
BUT YOU SEE WE JUST CAN'T AND IT WOULD BE THE MADDEST WEAKNESS TO YIELD GO INTO SOCIETY I WILL NOT SAID MARJORIE
THE WIDE OUTSIDE WORLD WHICH WE GET A GLIMPSE OF FROM OUR OWN DEAR LITTLE PARADISE IS MOST STRENGTHENING TO OUR CHARACTERS
WHEN HER YOUNG GUEST ARRIVED SHE HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS TO WELCOME HER
WHAT IS IT ANNIE CALLED LESLIE RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW AND STARING IN ASTONISHMENT AT HER ROOM-FELLOW
CHAPTER XX NOT A BIT LIKE IT
I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO IRRITATE HER A GOOD DEAL DURING THE LAST DAY OR TWO AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BETTER SUCCESS THAN I I WON'T KEEP YOU A MOMENT ANSWERED JANE
NOT THAT IT GREATLY MATTERS
NOTHING HE ANSWERED
SOON AFTERWARDS LLEWELLYN AND HESTER STARTED OFF FOR THE RAILWAY STATION
I TOLD THE OTHER GIRLS I WOULD BRING YOU
I COULD NOT THINK OF MARRYING UNTIL MY DEAR ANNIE HAD A HOME OF HER OWN I FELT CERTAIN THAT YOU HAD A GOOD MOTIVE IN KEEPING THE IMPORTANT NEWS BACK FROM HER REPLIED INNOCENT MRS ACHESON
AND IF THEY MARRIED THEIR HUSBANDS WOULD LOOK AFTER THEM
DO GO UP TO YOUR ROOM AT ONCE DEAR AND HAVE A LONG GOOD SLEEP NOT QUITE YET MOTHER SAID BELLE LOOKING UP FROM HER BOOK
THIS CHEST OF DRAWERS IS FOR YOUR LINEN AND THE BODICE OF YOUR DRESSES
DON'T QUESTION ME NOW MOTHER
I AM ONLY BIDING MY TIME TO GIVE HIM A LEG UP BUT I DON'T THINK LLEWELLYN MEANS TO TAKE A LEG UP AS YOU CALL IT FROM ANYONE
AS SHE INTENDED TO AIM AT A FIRST OR AT LEAST SECOND CLASS HER RANGE OF STUDY WAS VERY WIDE
MY MOTHER HAS TOLD ME THAT YOUR MOTHER
THIS WILL NEVER DO
I WISH IT WAS NOT NECESSARY SAID EILEEN
SHE LOOKS VERY TIRED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN OVERDOING IT I ASSURE YOU MOTHER SAID BELLE THAT MOST OF THE ST WODE'S STUDENTS HAVE THAT SORT OF LOOK
OH DO JUST KEEP A NICE HOT CUP OF TEA FOR ME SHE CALLED OUT
LESLIE ARRIVED AT THE CHETWYNDS HOUSE TO SEE THE STREET OUTSIDE COVERED WITH STRAW
SEE 41326-H.HTM OR 41326-H.ZIP
I CANNOT EAT SAID MARJORIE
I DON'T EXPECT TO SEE MUCH OF ANY OF YOU
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME
KELLER
MAMMY YOU'LL GET ACCUSTOMED TO US AFTER A BIT SHE CRIED
BUT SUPPOSE MISS COLCHESTER--SUPPOSE I WHO MAY NOT HAVE QUITE SO MUCH WORK TO DO AT PRESENT AS YOU HAVE OF COURSE YOU WON'T YOU SILLY GIRL
I SHALL TAKE IN MY GIRL RESIDENTS ON THE CHEAPEST TERMS
THE GIRL CALLED JANE BEGAN TO TALK TO LESLIE AND TOLD HER SOME OF THE RULES OF THE PLACE
GIVE ME YOUR HAND
NOW LOOK AT MISS GILROY
SHE WOUND HER ARMS STILL TIGHTER ROUND HER MOTHER'S WAIST AND KISSED HER ON HER CHEEK
THERE'S NO MANNER OF USE IN YOUR GIVING WAY AND DON'T FOR GOODNESS SAKE
THE WORK-GIRL HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY EILEEN IN FOX BUILDINGS
AND YOU--GOD KNOWS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO CONFESS TO ME
AND THEN WE ARE PROPERLY CHAPERONED YOU KNOW
IT WOULD REALLY YES MOTHER
SHE NOW RAN EAGERLY UP TO LESLIE
SHE BENT AND KISSED MRS CHETWYND ON HER CHEEK
HAS THIS TROUBLE TURNED ME INTO A STONE CHAPTER XXIII THE PICNIC
MARJORIE SUDDENLY JUMPED TO HER FEET
BUT I HOPE YOU WON'T CALL ME IT
THERE IS THOUGHT EXPRESSED IN THE FIRM CURVES OF YOUR LIPS
WE HAVE NO LUXURIES
BUT IF IT'S THE FASHION WHY I CAN'T SAY A WORD
JANIE THAT COCOA WAS EXCELLENT
BUT DEAR HELEN I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT YOU HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
SURELY SURELY THAT WOULD BE A MORE SUBSTANTIAL HELP TO THE SWEETEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD THAN YOUR EARNING A POUND A WEEK NOW AT LEE FORREST'S THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY LESLIE
LET ME GO LET ME GO NOT WITHOUT ME SAID LESLIE WITH SUDDEN FIRMNESS
OFTEN AND OFTEN WHEN ALL THE CHILDREN WERE IN BED SHE SAT UP OR WENT ROUND FROM ONE EDITOR'S OFFICE TO ANOTHER SUPPLYING THE NECESSARY ITEMS WHICH WOULD APPEAR THE NEXT MORNING IN THE PAPERS
MRS CHETWYND HAD GONE TO SOME EXPENSE IN HAVING DOORS BROKEN IN THE WALLS TO EFFECT THIS ARRANGEMENT
SHE'LL BE A BIT SURPRISED BUT I GUESS SHE'LL BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO CONSENT
BUT BEFORE I GO TELL ME--DO TELL ME--IF YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IN ALL THIS I SAID MARJORIE--SHE HESITATED
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN YES YES
IT WAS THIS
I SHOULD THINK SHE WAS
MY HOME IS COMFORTABLE AND MOTHER ALWAYS DOES EXACTLY WHAT I LIKE
HER QUEER RED-BROWN EYES WITH THEIR DISTENDED PUPILS GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER
YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN THAT MRS CHETWYND WON'T MIND MIND
LESLIE WENT TO HER WINDOW AND SHUT IT SIGHED AS SHE THOUGHT HOW CLOSE HER PART OF THE ROOM WOULD BE WHEN SHE RETURNED LATER ON
DO TELL ME I CANNOT REPLIED ANNIE ABRUPTLY
LESLIE GRASPED IT
BUT COME UPSTAIRS ANNIE
BUT SHE IS A LITTLE BETTER TO-DAY ONLY MARJORIE TALKED SOME HUMBUG ABOUT PRAYER
WELL CONTINUED BELLE MY MOTHER IS FAIRLY WELL OFF--OF COURSE NOT NEARLY SO RICH AS THE CHETWYNDS
SHE PRETENDED NOT TO REMARK THEM NEVERTHELESS SHE FOUND HER OWN SHORT-SIGHTED ORBS MEETING HIS AGAIN AND AGAIN
LESLIE DO YOU THINK HIM AS BAD AS ALL THAT HE IS VERY BAD ANNIE AND HE IS MAKING YOU BAD--AND OH INDIRECTLY HE IS MAKING ME BAD TOO
DEAR DEAR
SHE SIMPLY WON'T BE REASONABLE
ANY SPARE CASH WE HAVE WILL GO FOR BOOKS--FIRST EDITIONS ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS
MOTHER HAS SO LITTLE SYMPATHY
MR GILROY DURING HIS LIFETIME HAD BEEN SUB-EDITOR ON A LARGE LONDON DAILY AND AFTER HIS DEATH MRS GILROY GOT A POST ON THE STAFF
DO YOU CALL THIS A BARE ROOM CRIED BELLE
YOU HAD BETTER LET YOUR WORRY GO
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SOME OF YOUR FAITH CAME TO ME
HE HAS GONE SHE SAID
THE OFFER HAS TO DO WITH YOU LESLIE WITH ME SAID LESLIE
NOW GO
SHE'LL LEND IT FAST ENOUGH IF YOU PULL A LONG FACE AND MAKE UP A PITIABLE STORY AND I'LL MEET YOU SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO-MORROW
THIS ALL REMINDS ME OF POOR GILROY HE SAID
I DID REPLIED LESLIE
SORRY
POOR MOTHER HERSELF MUST BE EXCLUDED AND SHE WILL FEEL IT POOR THING
SHE WISHES BY AND BY TO EARN HER BREAD AS A TEACHER
IT IS A SPLENDID CHANCE FOR YOU LESLIE AND I'M NOT THE FELLOW TO STAND IN YOUR WAY BUT I JUST WISH YOU WOULD SHE CRIED
I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME TOO
WELL NEVER MIND
HE STARTED BACK
HE WOULD COME DOWN TO WINGFIELD HE WOULD SEE ANNIE HE WOULD SPEAK TO THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT HER SHE WOULD BE RUSTICATED SENT DOWN EXPELLED
WE DON'T QUITE KNOW YET WHAT WE MEAN TO DO WITH OUR LIVES
SIMPLE MA'AM YOU CAN SEE--SIMPLE AS MY OWN TASTES
ANNIE YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS
I HAVE ASTIGMATISM IN ONE EYE AND HAVE THEREFORE TO WEAR SPECIAL SPECTACLES
COFFEE AND A WET TOWEL
EILEEN WENT AND OPENED IT
I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO KEEP YOUR PART JUST THERE IN THE CORNER AS TIDY AS YOU PLEASE
MISS ACHESON I HEARTILY RESPECT YOU
COME ALONG NOW
BUT HAS HE NO PERMANENT ADDRESS DEAR ME MOTHER SAID BELLE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM DOES THAT MATTER
HE STOOD AND FACED ANNIE COLCHESTER
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I HAVE BEEN LED INTO THESE TERRIBLE DEBTS
LESLIE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND DID NOT DARE TO MEET HER MOTHER'S EYES
POOR DARLINGS THEY ARE AS LOVING AS POSSIBLE
SHE HAD THE SAME VOICE AND SOMETHING THE SAME WAYS AND VERY MUCH THE SAME EXPRESSION
AND THAT REMINDS ME ANNIE WHAT A GOOSE YOU WERE NOT TO TAKE HONORS IN YOUR EXAM
I SHOULD LIKE TO SETTLE DOWN TO MY WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WELL OF COURSE YOU CAN SPEAK TO MISS FRERE
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I AM ILL OR WELL REPLIED MARJORIE
GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK AGAIN MISS LESLIE HE SAID
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR SAID EILEEN
BEAR THE TERRIBLE AND CRUEL POSITION IN WHICH YOU ARE PLACED
SHE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO FORGIVE ME FOR MY APPARENT RUDENESS OF LAST NIGHT AND ALSO TO GIVE ME THE NECESSARY PERMISSION TO SPEND TO-DAY IN LONDON I AM RATHER SURPRISED ANSWERED LESLIE
WHEN THINGS ARE IN THEIR RIGHT PLACES THEY CAN NEVER BE FOUND
BUT SHE OUGHT TO BE ON HER WAY TO EAST HALL BY NOW
NOW OUR ROOMS FOR INSTANCE ARE QUITE DECENTLY FURNISHED TOO MUCH FURNITURE INTERRUPTED BELLE
AS WE HAVE A GUEST TO-NIGHT BELLE DEAR
WHAT TERRIBLE TIMES THESE MODERN DAYS ARE
SHE WAS GLAD TO BE WITH MARJORIE
BUT HER EYES ANXIOUSLY GLANCED FROM TABLE TO TABLE IN THE HOPE OF ONCE MORE SEEING HER TWO COMPANIONS OF THE CAB
THERE I DON'T MEAN TO EXCUSE MYSELF
BUT HARK LLEWELLYN NOT A WORD OF THIS TO YOUR MOTHER CERTAINLY NOT IF YOU DO NOT WISH IT SIR
HER FAINT SOBS SOUNDED THROUGH THE ROOM
HER FACE WAS RED AND INFLAMED IN PARTS AND DEADLY WHITE IN OTHER PARTS HER EYES HAD SUNK INTO HER HEAD AND THEIR COLOR WAS ALMOST WASHED AWAY WITH VIOLENT WEEPING
HER WORDS WERE FORCIBLE AND FULL OF POWER PUT TOGETHER WITH MUCH GRAMMATICAL FLUENCY AND ABSOLUTELY TO THE POINT
HE WAS KIND TO HER FOR HER DEAD FATHER'S SAKE AND BECAUSE HE IMAGINED THAT SHE BORE A LIKENESS TO THE CHILD HE HAD LOST
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE I AM TO WORK IN A PLACE LIKE THIS IF I THINK OF SMALL PETTY THINGS WHICH OCCUPY HOME-GIRLS
WHAT A LIKENESS BETWEEN THE TWO SAID DR HOWARD
HE IS VERY INDEPENDENT MR PARKER AYE AYE
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ALL THE USUAL ONES I THINK REPLIED LETITIA
LETITIA WAS AS PRETTY TRIM AND AGREEABLE TO THE EYE AS A YOUNG GIRL COULD BE
SHE DETERMINED TO MAKE HERSELF AS PLEASANT AS POSSIBLE AND NOT TO ALLUDE TO THE UNTIDY WARDROBES THE GAUCHE APPEARANCE AND THE CROPPED HEADS UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING
CAN YOU COME NOW AT ONCE
ONE MOMENT IT SEEMS TO BE RUNNING AWAY THE NEXT IT STOPS DEAD--THEN IT IS WABBLY QUITE UNCERTAIN
AND AS TO DRESS I DO HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY ONE THING
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU STILL LLEWELLYN DID NOT REPLY
WHY SHOULDN'T I DARE
YOUR EYES HAVE GOT THE QUEEREST EXPRESSION NEVER MIND ABOUT MY EYES REPLIED LESLIE
YOU WOULD NOT SPEAK THOSE WORDS TO ME IF YOU KNEW WHAT I FELT IN MY HEART
MR PARKER CAME TO SEE ME TO-DAY AND HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING AND YOU BETRAYED ME ANNIE FLUNG HERSELF SUDDENLY ON HER KNEES
HOW QUEER MOTHER
ONE OF THE MANY BENEFITS OF COMING TO COLLEGE IS TO STRENGTHEN THE SOCIAL SIDE OF ONE'S CHARACTER SAID JANE
WE'LL COME ROUND AND SEE MRS FOWLER AND THE BAIRNS TO-MORROW
WE WHO WERE SO LOW ARE NOW IN THE ASCENDANT
IT MAY BE SMALLPOX BUT I DON'T THINK SO BELLE YOU ARE INTOLERABLE
I HATE BEING WITH HER AND YET I CANNOT KEEP AWAY FROM HER SHE WAITED FOR ANNIE TO SPEAK AGAIN
BELLE WAS STANDING IN THE HALL
THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR MODERN EDUCATION KNOW A THING TOO MUCH WHEN THEY'RE A MATCH FOR A SHREWD OLD FELLOW LIKE MYSELF
THE HOUSEMAID KNOWS IT AND NOW I WARN YOU
AND SO WOULD YOU IF YOU HAD A BROTHER LIKE RUPERT AND YOU FELT THAT ALL HIS FUTURE DEPENDED ON YOUR HELPING HIM
OF COURSE YOU WILL NOT COME
DEAR DEAR ADDED LETTIE SIGHING GENTLY HOW FAR AWAY ALL THAT TIME SEEMS NOW
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD PROMISED BEFORE GOD NOT TO BETRAY HER MISERABLE COMPANION YET SHE KNEW NO SENSE OF HAPPINESS
YOU MAY GET THE DRESSES MOTHER SAID EILEEN ONLY I SINCERELY HOPE YOU WON'T FOR WE CANNOT WEAR THEM
NOW I START AT ONCE WITH A POUND A WEEK
SHE SEEMS SO TIRED AND--I SCARCELY LIKE TO SAY THE WORD--SO HUNGRY OH I DARE SAY SHE IS REPLIED BELLE IN A CARELESS TONE
THE THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE WAS DELIGHTFUL AND SHE LOOKED UPON IT AS LLEWELLYN'S GIFT
ANNIE WAS ONLY ABLE TO MAKE A VERY SCANTY AND IMPERFECT TOILET
YOU SAY THAT MOTHER BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW THEM WELL I DO KNOW ONE THING CONTINUED MRS CHETWYND HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
SHE LIVES IN NO
WHEN WILL THE BASKETS BE READY
YOU HAVE A NICE FACE TOO AND I DARE SAY WE SHALL PULL TOGETHER ALL RIGHT
BUT A CAPITAL GOOD FELLOW AT BOTTOM
LONG LONG AGO I SAW THAT THOSE TWO DEAR GIRLS BEHIND US WHO ARE USING THEIR MUSCULAR STRENGTH IN PROPELLING US DOWNSTREAM HAD REAL INTELLIGENCE THAT FINE BRAINS FILLED THEIR CRANIUMS
I HAVE ONE COMFORT HOWEVER
SHE TOOK UP HER HANDKERCHIEF AS SHE SPOKE TO WIPE AWAY THE TEARS FROM HER EYES
ANNIE SAT DOWN ON A SOFA TOOK UP THE NOVEL SHE HAD BEEN READING THAT AFTERNOON AND TURNED A PAGE OR TWO LISTLESSLY
SHE TOOK UP A BOOK BUT SHE COULD NOT READ
IN ORDER TO HELP MY FELLOW-CREATURES IN ORDER TO IMPRESS UPON THEM THE GREATNESS OF ETERNITY AND THE FRIVOLITY OF TIME IN ORDER WHEN I REALLY PASS AWAY THAT I MAY LEAVE FOOTPRINTS BEHIND ME ON THE SANDS OF TIME HEAR HEAR SAID MARJORIE
SHE WAS A TALL GIRL WITH QUANTITIES OF GOLDEN-BROWN HAIR LARGE BROWN EYES A COMPLEXION OF CREAM AND ROSES AND STRAIGHT REGULAR FEATURES
OCCASIONALLY IN THE EXCITEMENT OF MY THOUGHTS I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN AN EVENING DRESS
ALL I WANT AT PRESENT IS TWENTY POUNDS
DO YOU NEVER LOOK FORWARD FORWARD SAID BELLE
I HAVE JUST REACHED THE BOTTOM OF A PROBLEM
I AM INDEED
CHAPTER XXX--ANNIE IN THE TOILS
I CANNOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM IS THAT GIRL BELLE ACHESON CRIED LESLIE IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
I AM GIVING A COCOA PARTY TO-NIGHT YOU KNOW HOW DELIGHTFUL SAID LESLIE
I SPEAK TO YOU FROM MY SOUL
ONLY BE QUICK ABOUT IT THEY WALKED ROUND THE SQUARE MANY TIMES
YOU WILL NOT CAUSE ME TO ALLOW LUXURIES TO CREEP INTO MY LIFE
TELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH LITTLE GIRL I CAN'T
IN THESE DAYS THEY ARE
BETWEEN IT AND HER LAY A SIN--A SIN WHICH SHE COMMITTED FOR THE ONE SHE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD
THERE WAS A STRAINED EXPRESSION IN HER EYES AS IF SHE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
I'M QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO THIS SORT OF THING.--MARJORIE HAVE YOU A PENKNIFE
FOR WOMEN EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
I AM DOING SO
BUT I SHALL HAVE QUITE MONEY ENOUGH OF MY OWN TO PAY THE RENT OF THE HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER I LEAVE COLLEGE
I HAVE NOT EVEN LOOKED AT THEM
I WILL WORK JUST DOUBLE TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE IT UP TO HIM
I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU A BALLAD I SUPPOSE SAID LETITIA
I MAY ALMOST SAY THAT MOST DO
I WISH I DIDN'T FEEL IT SO MUCH HE SAID TO HIMSELF
I CAN JUST BEAR TO BE AWAY FROM EILEEN WHEN YOU ARE HERE FOR YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHERS
SHE WANTS ME TO LOOK OVER SOME OF HER MATRICULATION PAPERS AND I MUST ON NO ACCOUNT FAIL HER BUT MY DEAR BELLE ANNE MORRISON LIVES AT THE SOUTH SIDE OF LONDON AND I AM SO TIRED SAID POOR MRS ACHESON
HE THEN PROCEEDED TO SKETCH A MOST VIVID AND GRAPHIC PICTURE OF HIS OWN SUFFERINGS THE EXTREME DANGER IN WHICH HE STOOD AND THE AWFUL DISGRACE WHICH WOULD FALL UPON ANNIE'S DEVOTED HEAD WHEN THE LAW OF THE LAND TOOK ITS COURSE UPON HIM
I HAVE GOT INTO A TERRIBLE SCRAPE HERE AND ONLY YOU CAN GET ME OUT AGAIN
OH MY DEAR IT IS ONLY THE BODY
YOU DO NOTHING BUT WALK ROUND THE SUBJECT AND NEVER ATTACK IT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WILL INTEREST YOU SAID BELLE
SHE THEN WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE DOOR AND FLUNG IT OPEN
BUT WHAT DOES THE LAD WANT HIMSELF--THAT IS THE QUESTION LLEWELLYN WANTS TO GO EITHER TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE SAID LESLIE
ANNIE SHRANK BACK IN HER CORNER
BUT BETTER DAYS WILL DAWN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET
YOU WON'T OF COURSE TAKE PART IN THE DEBATE TO-NIGHT BUT YOU CAN LOOK ON AND FIND OUT HOW FAR YOU ARE LIKELY TO ENJOY YOURSELF AMONGST US WITH SO MANY TEMPTATIONS I THINK I WILL WAIT TO BE INTRODUCED TO MISS MAPLE UNTIL TO-MORROW SAID LESLIE
IT DOES BURN AWFULLY SAID LESLIE
YOU NEED NOT REMAIN IN THIS HOUSE AFTER ALL LESLIE FOR I CANNOT BE WITH YOU
YOU SEE MY DEAR I HAVE LARGE MEANS FOR MY HUSBAND CAME IN FOR THE PROPERTY OF HIS ELDER BROTHER WHO DIED SIX MONTHS BEFORE HIM
SHE AMASSED KNOWLEDGE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY
THE NEXT INSTANT THE WINDOW WAS LIFTED AND RUPERT COLCHESTER STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
BELLE WAS KNOWN TO BE ERRATIC AND UNCERTAIN
PERHAPS I'LL HAVE MY LITTLE REVENGE YET BUT YOU WOULD NOT REALLY DO ANYTHING WRONG RUPERT OH DEAR ME NO SAID RUPERT IN A SARCASTIC VOICE
IT GIVES ONE A DISTINGUISHED LOOK
HOW AM I TO HELP HIM PRESENTLY MRS ACHESON SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO BED
THE TWO GIRLS MEAN TO BE MERELY USEFUL--MERELY USEFUL WITH EYES LIKE THOSE AND LIPS AND TEETH
IT'S MISS GILROY SIR
BUT OH RUPERT IF LESLIE FINDS OUT THAT YOU HAVE BROKEN YOUR WORD IT IS IN HER TO BE VERY HARD
SING SOMETHING IN WHICH YOUR REAL FEELINGS APPEAR--A MODERN LOVE-SONG FOR INSTANCE OR SOMETHING ABOUT FINE DRESS OR NOTHING TO WEAR OR ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR REAL STYLE
YOU SHALL STAY WITH ME FOR A WEEK AT LEAST
SUPPOSE SHE WAS NOT IN HER ROOM AT ALL
THE TRUTH NOW HE SAID
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE YOU COMPLETELY IN MY POWER
DON'T WAIT FOR ME SAID LESLIE
I WILL NOT PLEAD FOR MYSELF
HE MANAGED HOWEVER TO USE HIS VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
SHE DID NOT WITHDRAW HER HAND FROM LESLIE'S
SURELY YOU CAN VISIT THE POOR WHEN YOU COLLEGE LIFE IS OVER WE CAN AT LEAST MAKE CLOTHES FOR THEM
HE WAS NOT A MAN TO DO THINGS BY HALF-MEASURES AND HE DID NOT LOSE AN HOUR IN TAKING MEANS TO DISCOVER RUPERT COLCHESTER'S WHEREABOUTS
HE IS GOOD TO YOU I DO NOT KNOW HIM WELL REPLIED LESLIE
I WILL GET THE WHOLE NAKED TRUTH OUT OF HER
A FAINT COLOR CAME INTO HER THIN CHEEKS
THERE ANNIE YOU NEED NOT STAY UP ANY LONGER
HE WAS MY ONLY BROTHER AND I--I COULD NEVER TURN FROM HIM
LESLIE SEATED ON HER OWN SOFA AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM SEEMED ALWAYS IN HER MOMENTS OF BITTEREST GRIEF IN THE FUTURE TO SEE THAT TRESS OF HAIR TOSSED UP AND DOWN BY THE WIND
HE MUST
WHAT DOES A CALCULUS OF FINITE DIFFERENCES MEAN
DO YOU THINK OUR SERVANTS WOULD TOUCH MY MONEY
DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKELY I WOULD LEAVE THIS PLACE WHEN I HAD SIXTY POUNDS IN MY POCKET BUT YOU OWED THAT MONEY
WHEN THE MORNING DAWNED SHE WENT TO HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM
DON'T BE QUITE SO--SO OUTRE DURING YOUR FIRST INTERVIEW DO I FRIGHTEN YOU SAID BELLE
WITH PURSED-UP LIPS AND A WISE SHAKE OF HIS HEAD MR PARKER SLIPPED THE LETTER AND THE SCRAP OF PAPER INTO HIS POCKET AND LEFT THE OFFICE
IT IS UNFAIR ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR FOR ME TO COME TO YOU ON FALSE PRETENSES OH WHETHER YOU ARE CLEVER OR NOT YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WANTED A WEEK'S REST
BEAUTY IS A POWER WHICH CAN BE USED FOR GOOD
EILEEN AND I HAVE KNITTED SOME BABY SOCKS FOR THE LAST ADDITION TO YOUR FAMILY FOWLER CONTINUED MARJORIE
OH I LOVE HER MR PARKER
WHEN YOU UTTER THE WORD LOVE AT SUCH A MOMENT LIKE THE PRESENT YOU MAKE ME ACTUALLY SICK I WILL NOT UTTER IT AGAIN SAID ANNIE
THE DOCTORS HAVE JUST GONE TOO AND THEY BELIEVE THAT SHE IS ON THE MEND
IT IS ALL ARRANGED
HER EYES WITH A STARTLED STRAINED LOOK IN THEM TURNED SLOWLY TO LESLIE WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
SHE CEASED STARING AT THEM HER GLASSES WERE USELESS HER EYES WERE DIM
KING'S CROSS WAS REACHED WITHOUT ADVENTURE AND A MOMENT LATER MARJORIE WAS EAGERLY TALKING TO OLD FOWLER THE COACHMAN
SHE CLUTCHED HOLD OF LESLIE STILL TIGHTER
WE ARE ALL FRESHERS REPLIED LETTIE
HOW IS SHE NOW SAID BELLE
THE HOUSE WAS A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND ORDER ALTHOUGH THERE WAS ONLY ONE SMALL SERVANT
THEY KNOW ME NOW
THEY ARE ALL DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
AND--OH LEW IT CAN'T BE BORNE IT MUST BE BORNE HE REPLIED STOUTLY
DON'T SPEAK TO ME AGAIN SHE MUTTERED
BUT TRY AS SHE WOULD SHE COULD NOT GET IT BACK
I AM VERY HAPPY TO-DAY--WHAT OCCURRED HAS GIVEN ME--I CANNOT EXACTLY TELL YOU WHAT BUT A WONDERFUL FEELING
BUT YOU ACT SOMEHOW AS IF YOU DID
A CARRIAGE WILL HOLD YOU AND MYSELF AND A COUPLE OF THE CHILDREN
BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING I ASSURE YOU
AFTER A TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
AFTER A TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND THERE IS MORE IN IT THAN MEETS THE EYE
LESLIE CAME EAGERLY FORWARD
NOW MY DARLING HE HAS OFFERED TO PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES EITHER AT NEWNHAM OR AT THAT OTHER GREAT COLLEGE ST WODE'S WINGFIELD
THAT IS THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT FEEL SO MISERABLE THE GIRLS ENTERED THE LITTLE BOUDOIR WHICH MRS CHETWYND HAD SO CAREFULLY PREPARED FOR HER DARLINGS
I HAVE NO FAULT WHATEVER TO FIND
YOU MIGHT HAVE ASKED ME FOR THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND NOT GONE INTO DEBT FOR IT
WILL YOU COME THIS WAY MAY I COME TOO ASKED ANNIE
BELLE YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL IN YOU
AND SHE SAID I SUPPOSE LOVE YOU ARE COLLECTING COINS I SAID YES MOTHER
IN THE INTEREST OF MY PATIENT I TAKE UPON MYSELF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GIVING YOU PERMISSION TO STAY
THIS LITTLE GIRL OR RATHER YOU MISS"--HE PAUSED BUT LESLIE DID NOT SUPPLY THE NAME--"HAVE MADE IT ALL RIGHT FOR ME VERY WELL
ANNIE WENT ON MUTTERING TO HERSELF RUSTLING HER PAPERS AND TURNING THE LEAVES OF HER BOOKS
YES BEGAN BELLE I HAVE SUBMITTED FOR ONE HOUR UNDER PROTEST AS SHE SPOKE SHE LOOKED FULL AT LESLIE
LESLIE GILROY LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
PERHAPS SOMETHING WILL TURN UP AT THE END OF A WEEK
EVEN IF THE LAW DID NOT PUNISH HER SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANY GOOD IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN
I WILL ADMIT THAT THIS HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND ANNOYED ME
BUT THE HOUSE WAS PERFECTLY ORGANIZED AND NO ONE FELT UNDULY FATIGUED
AREN'T YOU GOING OUT
IN DESPAIR SHE CAME BACK AND JOINED LESLIE
I AM TOLD THAT THAT EXTRAORDINARY AND MOST UNPLEASANT GIRL BELLE ACHESON HAS BEGUN TO TAKE TO YOU
I WISH YOU WOULD THINK MORE OF HOW YOU ARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR SCRAPE
MRS CHETWYND GLANCED AT LETITIA OF WHOM BELLE HAD NOT TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE AND THE YOUNG GIRL FOLLOWED THE ECCENTRIC SCHOLARLY UNDERGRADUATE OF ST WODE'S UPSTAIRS
MY ONLY COMFORT IS THAT THEIR POOR DEAR FATHER--SUCH A KIND SCHOLARLY SOLDIERLY MAN--IS NOT HERE TO WITNESS THEIR BASE INGRATITUDE BUT REALLY AUNT HELEN I DON'T THINK THEY ARE BASE NOR UNGRATEFUL
SHE WORKS TOO HARD AND SHE BUT THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO SAY ANY MORE DON'T SAY ANY MORE CRIED JANE
I WILL LEAVE HER ALONE NOW
SHE STOOD NOW WITH HER BACK TO THE GIRLS AND HER FACE TO THE VIEW
FAR TOO MUCH HE ANSWERED
SHE WOULD GIVE ANNIE A CHANCE SHE WOULD NOT BETRAY HER SHE WOULD GET ANNIE HERSELF TO MAKE HER OWN CONFESSION
HE WAS BENDING OVER THE FIRE LOOKING INTO THE BLAZE
WELL CHILDREN WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY JOINING YOU TO-DAY HE TURNED AND FACED KITTY AND HESTER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IF YOU WILL JUST STAND WITH YOUR BACK TO THE LIGHT YOU CAN GO ON THINKING AND TALKING
WHAT'S THE MATTER LEW
I HATE BEING PETTED AND FONDLED SHE SAID
I KNOW SHE HAS GONE RIGHT THROUGH THE SIXTH BOOK OF HERODOTUS AND I HAVE NOT
BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW WHY ANNIE COLCHESTER HAS GONE UP TO TOWN SAID EILEEN SUDDENLY
OH GOOD GRACIOUS EILEEN TAKE CARE WHERE YOU ARE GOING
I SHALL BE AT 30 NEWBOLT SQUARE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE TO-NIGHT
EVEN MY OWN FAMILIAR FRIENDS TURN FROM ME
LESLIE SAYS THAT IS THE ONLY THING TO DO AND WE ARE BOTH GOING TO CHURCH
I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO ENDURE MR PARKER'S EYES
YOU WILL NOTICE TOO THAT I AM ABSORBED IN STUDY
I DON'T PRETEND FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GOOD TO ME VERY GOOD
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE YOURSELF NOW
I KNOW THE TRUTH
BOTH HER HANDS WERE CLUTCHING IT TIGHTLY HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE WRITTEN WORDS AND HER FACE WAS WHITE
PUT IT ON MY FOREHEAD
I FEEL THIS MORE AND MORE THE LONGER I LIVE
CHAPTER XXIII--THE PICNIC
HER MOTHER IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE BUT IS EILEEN REALLY ILL ASKED LESLIE STARTING UP
NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR FATHER'S WILL AND THE IMPROPER ALLOWANCE WHICH I AM FORCED TO GIVE YOU BOTH AS LONG AS YOU ARE UNDER MY ROOF YOU MUST BE CLOTHED AS I WISH AND YOU MUST NOT GO TO PLACES THAT I DISAPPROVE OF
THE NEXT MOMENT THE FOOTMAN CAME UP OPENED THE DOOR OF THE BOUDOIR AND USHERED IN A VISITOR
EILEEN WAS ALSO SOUND ASLEEP AND HER ROOM WAS ALSO UNTIDY
PRESENTLY SHE OBSERVED MARJORIE AND EILEEN SEATED AT A TABLE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
WE SHOULD ALL BE IN THAT BINDWEED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER BY NOW BELLE DEAR SAID EILEEN PUSHING OUT HER FOOT AND GIVING HER FRIEND A KICK DO PLEASE COME DOWN FROM THE CLOUDS
WHEN ONCE WE HAVE PLUNGED INTO OUR NEW WORK WE SHALL BE AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG SAID EILEEN
DOES IT HELP HER THAT YOU SHOULD ABUSE ME
YOU ARE SO FOND OF LOOKING BACK
THIS ROOM IS BARE IS IT NOT BARE
I CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP HER JUST AT PRESENT AND I MEAN TO ENJOY MYSELF THEN HAD NOT YOU BETTER COME DOWN TO THE QUAY
NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE
WHERE CAN SHE BE LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN
ANNIE GLANCED AT HER AGAIN
I EXPECT I SHALL BE SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF HER I DON'T INTEND TO BE AFRAID OF ANYONE SAID EILEEN
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISAPPOINTMENT YOU GAVE ME WITH REGARD TO YOUR ROOM SHE SAID I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT MUSOPHILUS ALLUDES TO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YES REPLIED LESLIE
DON'T I BEG OF YOU COME TO ST WODE'S I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THIS ANSWERED LETTIE RUNNING AFTER BELLE AS SHE WAS FLYING DOWNSTAIRS IF EILEEN AND MARJORIE GO I MEAN TO ACCOMPANY THEM CHAPTER VII THE FATE OF THE GIRLS
I WAS WONDERING IF AUNT HELEN WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ME SING CERTAINLY MY DEAR
I MUST GO TO SEE MARJORIE IMMEDIATELY AND TO HEAR ABOUT EILEEN IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR INQUIRIES PROPERLY SAID BELLE GO BY THE UNDERGROUND
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY GUESS THAT REPLIED LESLIE LOOKING WITH ADMIRATION AT MARJORIE WHOSE PLAIN DRESS COULD NEVER TAKE AWAY FROM THE CHARM OF HER HANDSOME FACE
WHEN HE STOOD BY THE WINDOW SHE COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN HER UNEASINESS
I COULD LET YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR
IS IT COLD
THIS MORNING I INTEND TO MAKE A CAREFUL STUDY OF MY GREEK GRAMMAR AS IT IS MY INTENTION TO WRITE AN EXHAUSTIVE ESSAY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AEOLIC DIALECT WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM LITERATURE MRS ACHESON SIGHED AND ROSE HASTILY
ONLY YOU MUST GIVE ME TIME
HAVE YOU GOT ONE OF YOUR HEADACHES BACK AGAIN LESLIE ASKED LLEWELLYN
I AM THE COUSIN WHO HAS ALWAYS LIVED WITH THE TWINS
SHE SHUT THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HER
WHEN HE HAD DONE SO MARJORIE BURST INTO TEARS
SO YOU SEE MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER I HAD FORTY POUNDS LEFT TO GO ON THE SPREE WITH
I AM ASHAMED TO GO OUT WITH YOU AS MATTERS NOW STAND THE TWO GIRLS LEFT THE ROOM LINKING THEIR ARMS TOGETHER
THEY WERE FASHIONABLY DRESSED AND RUSHED UP TO JANE AND KISSED HER
BUT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE TEMPTATION
SHE HATED TO FOLLOW ANNIE WITH HER EYES AND YET THE THOUGHT OF HER AND HER TROUBLE WAS NEVER REALLY ABSENT FROM HER MIND
EILEEN LAUGHED
AND I QUITE SEE THE ALLUSION TO MYSELF
ONE OF THE DRONES OF OUR HIVE REPLIED BELLE STERNLY
SHE HAD A SMALL INCOME NOT EXCEEDING THREE HUNDRED A YEAR AND SIX CHILDREN TO MAINTAIN
A DEAD SOUL
LLEWELLYN WHO COULD READ HIS MOTHER LIKE A BOOK WHO LOVED HER PASSIONATELY SAW ALL THESE THOUGHTS NOW IN HER EYES
ONE AND ALL IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS ARE GOING FORWARD TO A GOAL
BUT SHE WAS NOT MRS CHEWYND'S OWN DAUGHTER WHICH MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE
THE TWO DOCTORS CAME DOWNSTAIRS
THE ENGLISH GIRL OF THE PRESENT DAY HAS HER FREEDOM
WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO STAY--AT NO
TRY AS SHE WOULD THE WIDOW COULD NOT TAKE THE ABSORBING INTEREST IN LETITIA THAT SHE DID IN EILEEN AND MARJORIE
THERE WAS A QUEER LOOK ON MARJORIE'S FACE TRACES OF RECENT TEARS IN HER EYES AND A SOFTNESS ABOUT HER MOUTH
SHE WAS MUTTERING TO HERSELF HALF-ALOUD
BUT IF YOU COME WITH ME AND PLEAD FOR ME JUST BECAUSE HE LIKES YOU BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU HE WILL GIVE THE POST TO ME
THERE IS TIME YET
QUITE APART FROM THE FEES AND GENERAL EXPENSES OF THE COLLEGE I RECEIVE TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS A TERM
NONE OF HER COMPANIONS CAME BY
WHEN ANNIE'S CUP WAS READY BRIMFUL AND FROTHY AND LOOKING AS TEMPTING AS IT COULD SHE BROUGHT IT TO HER WITH A BISCUIT
IT'S ONLY THE THOUGHT OF MOTHER DOING THIS BEASTLY GRIND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE SAID
HOW HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AT ALL--THAT IS I HAVE ONLY JUST TAKEN AN ORDINARY AND YOU MEANT TO TAKE A FIRST-CLASS IN HONORS YES THEN YOU HAVE DONE POORLY I KNOW I HAVE REPLIED ANNIE HANGING HER HEAD
LESLIE SHIVERED AS SHE RETURNED SLOWLY TO THE HOUSE
WE SHOULD HATE IT ALL YOU KNOW DEAR MAMMY SAID MARJORIE
YOU CAN NEVER GUESS WHAT DEPENDS ON MY WORK
FOR GOODNESS SAKE SIT STILL OR WE'LL BE UPSET SAID LETTIE
YOU ARE TO GO AND I AM TO STAY
SHE WORE LONG WEEPERS TO HER WIDOW'S CAP AND HER HAIR WAS BRUSHED SMOOTHLY AWAY FROM HER BROAD FOREHEAD
I HAVE A CARE THAT I CANNOT CONFIDE TO ANYONE PRAY DON'T
THE RENT WAS PRESENTLY SEWN UP
AND AS IT SEEMS TO BE ALL THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN HERE AND THE BODY TOO SAID MRS GILROY
SOON AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THERE CAME A RING TO THE FRONT DOOR AND RUPERT COLCHESTER WAS ANNOUNCED
I BELIEVE HER ROOM IS IN WEST HALL
YOUR SISTER WROTE A LETTER IN MY NAME TO MY BEST FRIEND
THE NEXT DAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LUNCH AS ANNIE AND LESLIE WERE BOTH ENGAGED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE TASKS A SERVANT CAME UP AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
IT MAKES ONE BELIEVE IN CHRISTIANITY
YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN THE PASSION OF YOUR HEART SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY TO GO TO ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND NOW MOTHER DEAR IT IS SURELY NOT TOO LATE
SOME OF THE STUDENTS HERE EVEN GO THE LENGTH OF TURNING THE CHEST OF DRAWERS SO THAT THE DRAWERS MAY FACE THE WALL
I KNOW I AM EXTREMELY PLAIN AND THE FACT IS I GLORY IN BEING SO IT IS MY TURN NOW TO BE SURPRISED SAID RUPERT VERY GENTLY
LESLIE HOW IS EILEEN
EIGHTY-NINE POUNDS SEVEN SHILLINGS AND TENPENCE SHE SAID
THE FACT IS IT IS HE WHO HAS SENT ME HERE
ANNIE THINK IT RUDE TO BE LEFT ALONE
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY WEARY FROM ALL THAT WORK TO BED SAID ANNIE
I ONLY TRUST SHE WON'T WAKE BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR O'CLOCK FOR I AM DEAD TIRED REMEMBERING ANNIE'S WARNING LESLIE PUT THE SCREEN ROUND HER BED NEXT TUMBLED IN
I HAVE NOT THE GHOST OF A VOICE REPLIED EILEEN
I ONLY MET THE CHETWYNDS TO-DAY AND THEY WERE SPEAKING OF HER BELLE IS A PERFECT HORROR SAID JANE
HIS MOTHER GLANCED AT HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS SPEECH AND CONTINUED WITH HER STORY
SO THAT AFFAIR IS SETTLED
HE CLASPED THEM SO TIGHT THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY SHE COULD REPRESS A CRY
I HAVE NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT DRESSES I HAVE
I PITY YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART MINE IS A VERY GREAT TEMPTATION REPEATED LESLIE
IT IS VERY BAD I KNOW
NO ONE WAS EVER QUITE SO NEAR TO ME
BUT FOR GIRLS HE HAS A PECULIAR FEELING AN UNBOUNDED PITY
AND THAT REMAINS FOR YOU TO DISCOVER ANNIE MINE BUT DEAR RUPERT THERE ARE NO MEANS OPEN TO ME
LETTIE INSTANTLY GUIDED THEIR LITTLE CRAFT INTO MIDSTREAM
AND I KNOW YOU WILL GRANT IT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING
I HAVE ASKED TO BE PUT IN ONE OF THE ATTICS
THEN WHEN YOU MEET BY THE RIVER YOU MUST JUST TELL HER THAT I HAD A BAD HEADACHE AND WAS OBLIGED TO STAY AT HOME
FINALLY SHE TREATED HERSELF TO A GREAT BUNCH OF FLOWERS AND SOME FLOWERING PLANTS
SEE THAT GREAT PIECE OF BRAID TRAILING IN FRONT OF YOUR DRESS
AND WHAT IS MORE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
I SHALL BELIEVE IN HIM AS LONG AS I LIVE
IT WILL SAVE YOU
WE ARE ALL THREE EIGHTEEN AND WE ARE COMING OUT IN ABOUT A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT WE ARE NOT COMING OUT SAID EILEEN
NOW THEN WE HAD BETTER SETTLE THIS MATTER AT ONCE
ANNIE LIVES WITH MRS GILROY WHO IS AS KIND AS KIND CAN BE TO THE MOTHERLESS GIRL
WHEN SHE HAS TAKEN SOMETHING HOT WHICH WILL BE MUCH BETTER THAN COLD WATER AND GOES TO BED REALLY WARM SHE WILL SLEEP
I AM OBLIGED TO YOU ALL THE SAME BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOUR HELP AS LLEWELLYN FINISHED HE TURNED TO LEAVE THE ROOM
THIS IS YOUR ROOM-FELLOW
YOU ARE MY SISTER ANNIE AND I GLORY IN THE FACT SAID ANNIE
THOSE DRESSES YOU HAVE ON NOW ARE SIMPLY DISGUSTING
WHEN MISS FRERE OR MISS MAPLE ASK YOU TO TEA THEY WILL DISCOURSE MUCH ON THAT POINT
POOR ALICE HAD TO SHARE MY SOFA-BED AND I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A TIGHT FIT IN THAT CASE WOULD IT NOT BE WISE FOR ME TO RUN UP IMMEDIATELY AND REMOVE THE KEY JANE HERIOT LAUGHED AGAIN
HOW HANDSOME THEY ARE TOO
BUT WHY DO YOU INQUIRE I AM SORRY--THAT IS ALL SAID JANE
THE DEAR LITTLE MOTHER WON'T MUCH LIKE IT
WE ALL LAUGH AT HER BUT WE ALL LIKE HER FOR SHE REALLY IS A GOOD OLD THING ALTHOUGH SUCH AN ODDITY
FOR I STILL LOVE YOU OH DON'T TALK HUMBUG ANNIE SAID RUPERT WITH AN ANGRY INTERJECTION
HIS HAIR WAS WILDLY RUBBED OVER HIS HEAD AND HIS EYES LOOKED FIERCER THAN ANNIE HAD EVER SEEN THEM WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
I HAD A DELIGHTFUL TIME ON THE CONTINENT BUT I NEVER FORGOT YOU MY LOVES
HER MOTHER KNITTED HER BROWS ANXIOUSLY
MRS CHETWYND WAS STILL LYING IN HER ROOM TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE REST
THEN CAME THE SPEECH FROM THE OPPOSITION
HE BEGAN TO TALK TO BELLE AT ONCE ABOUT CICERO SOCRATES HOMER AND HER OTHER FAVORITE WRITERS OF ANTIQUITY
SHE HAD A LAME KNEE AND A SICK BROTHER AND EILEEN SEIZED UPON HER AT ONCE AS A SUITABLE PERSON FOR THE JOB AS SHE EXPRESSED IT
BUT THAT IS THE WAY WITH MODERN GIRLS
HE THEN WENT AND STOOD IN THE DEEP EMBRASURE OF THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT AT THE MOON WHICH THREW ITS RADIANCE OVER THE GARDEN OUTSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WITHOUT THE LEAST WARNING BEGAN TO TALK OF BURGLARS
SHE IS GOING TO THE BETTER AND THE SPIRITUAL WORLD
BUT YOUR PALE CHEEKS AND THAT ANXIOUS EXPRESSION IN YOUR EYES MATTER A GREAT DEAL
I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU FRANKLY THAT ANNOY YOU I SHALL FOR I CANNOT POSSIBLY HELP MYSELF
BUT MRS GILROY TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN LESLIE AT PRESENT TO NOTICE HER SON'S DEPRESSION CONTINUED TO TALK CHEERFULLY
CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH THE WIDOW SPOKE IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE
AND YET--AND YET IT IS A REAL JOY TO SEE YOU POOR OLD GIRL SAID RUPERT PATTING ANNIE ON HER SHOULDER
I AM GOING TO MR PARKER BELLE FOUND THIS NOTE READ ITS CONTENTS FLUSHED SLOWLY ALL OVER RUBBED HER FOREHEAD IN A DISTRACTED WAY AND THEN HIDING THE NOTE IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESSING-GOWN RETURNED TO HER OWN ROOM
HE WILL BE LOCKED UP
SHE TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED ANNIE'S BED WAS EMPTY--ANNIE HERSELF HAD DISAPPEARED
THE MAN I WAS SPEAKING TO IS MY BROTHER SHE SAID
THEY FLEW UPSTAIRS TOGETHER AND A MOMENT LATER HAD ENTERED MARJORIE'S ROOM
THESE ATTICS ARE AT PRESENT UNFURNISHED AND THE COLLEGE WOULD DOUBTLESS WHEN THE MATTER WAS PROPERLY REPRESENTED ALLOW YOU TO HAVE THEM AS BARE AS YOU PLEASED
JUST THEN ANNIE COLCHESTER DARTED PAST THE LITTLE GROUP AND RAN QUICKLY UPSTAIRS
PLEASE COME INTO THE DINING ROOM BELLE SO THIS IS YOUR DOMICILE SAID BELLE
WHAT AN OLD BLIND FOOL I HAVE BEEN
YOU MUST DO AS YOU PLEASE BELLE OF COURSE SHE SAID
BUT BEFORE YOU BEGIN MOTHER DO WAIT FOR US CRIED MABEL
POOR FOWLER'S EARS WERE STILL RED FROM THE QUESTIONS WHICH EILEEN HAD PLIED HIM WITH
EACH PRECIOUS VALUABLE MOMENT HAS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
SHE PAUSED NOW AND A LOOK OF CONSIDERABLE EXPECTANCY FILLED HER EYES
SHE BROUGHT THE MONEY BACK AND NOW SHE NOT I IS GIVING IT TO YOU INDEED SAID THE MAN
I WISH I WAS NOT YOUR ROOMFELLOW ANNIE SAID LESLIE
I HAVE TOLD HER THAT I WILL GRANT HER REQUEST WHEN SHE TELLS ME THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THAT SIXTY POUNDS WHICH YOU TOOK FROM ME TO HER
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME TO LEAVE ANNIE ALONE IN THE FUTURE ANNIE UTTERED A SHARP CRY
WHEN HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE WOODEN BOX ANNIE FELT AS IF A BURNING-RED HAND HAD TOUCHED HER OWN HEART
I TELL YOU WHAT YOU'LL DO ANNIE
YOU HAVE DONE IT AND IT IS NOBLE OF YOU IT IS SPLENDID OF YOU
I EXPECT I SHALL ENJOY MYSELF
SINCE THAT HOUR I HAVE FELT CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING IS HIDDEN
YOU HAVE PASSED YOUR SWIMMING TEST SO IT IS ALL RIGHT
SHE FEELS SURE THAT YOU WOULD REFUSE HER OWN REQUEST AND SHE HAS ASKED ME TO PLEAD WITH YOU
GOOD-BY
GOOD-BY
GOOD-BY
BUT LESLIE AS SHE LAY BACK IN A DEEP CHAIR HAD A STRANGE FEELING OF INERTIA AND LASSITUDE ALL OVER HER
AND AS I HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY I MEAN TO MAKE IT AS PRETTY AND CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE AND AS LIKE A DREAM HAVE YOUR LECTURES BEEN DECIDED FOR YOU YET SAID EILEEN IN A WOULD-BE STERN VOICE
HER SISTER EILEEN WAS AT DEATH'S DOOR
THINK WHAT YOU WILL FEEL WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE COURT TO GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOUR BROTHER BUT OH RUPERT
UP TO THE PRESENT NO GIRL HAD EVER STAYED MORE THAN ONE TERM WITH ANNIE
SHE HAS NOT ONE SCRAP OF SENTIMENT IN HER COMPOSITION
IF YOU GET ME THAT TWENTY POUNDS I'LL LET YOU ALONE--I PROMISE I WILL--FOR A MONTH OR TWO BUT RUPERT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING WHATEVER ABOUT MRS ACHESON
BELLE ACHESON WAS AN IDEAL SCHOLARLY GIRL OF THE LATTER END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
DON'T SAY ANY MORE SAID EILEEN
MRS CHETWYND PUT DOWN HER KNITTING WITH A SIGH OF PLEASURE
I ADMIRE HER MORE THAN ANY WORLDLY GIRL I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS
ANNIE WENT STRAIGHT UP TO HER OWN TABLE BOWED SOMEWHAT AWKWARDLY TO MISS FRERE THE TUTOR WHO WAS AT THE HEAD AND THEN SEEING THAT THE TEACHER'S EYES WERE FIXED ON LESLIE SAID IN AN ABRUPT VOICE
I INJURE MY OWN EILEEN
GOD HAS HEARD ALL OUR PRAYERS
BY THE WAY YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A SOVEREIGN ABOUT YOU NO INDEED I DON'T POSSESS SO MUCH IN THE WORLD
NOW WHAT A TERRIBLE POSITION SHE FOUND HERSELF IN
IMPOSSIBLE
THE NEXT DAY MARJORIE AWOKE FROM HER LONG SLEEP WITH A STUNNED FEELING AT HER HEART BUT NO LONGER QUITE SUCH A KEEN SENSE OF DESPAIR
COME THIS WAY HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ANNIE BUT USHERED LESLIE INTO THE NEXT ROOM
THEN YOU ARE ONE OF THE RICH AND LUCKY ONES
HE WENT AND I THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
SHE WAS A GOOD CLASSICAL SCHOLAR AND WAS ALSO FOND OF MODERN LANGUAGES
FRIENDS OF MINE OF THE NAME OF ACHESON ASKED ME TO STAY WITH THEM FOR A WEEK
BUT YOU LOOK WORRIED MISS GILROY
SHE DID NOT SEE ANNIE AT ALL
SHE FELT GLAD THAT SHE HAD SECURED THE KEY
IN MY TIME SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDISCRIMINATE FLIRTATION OH WE NONE OF US DREAM OF FLIRTING SAID LESLIE WITH A LAUGH
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
IN AUSTRALIA WE WOULD GIVE A BOY LIKE THAT A BIT OF THE BUSH TO CLEAR OUT AND A HOUSE TO BUILD AND WE WOULD TEACH HIM THE ROUGH ESSENTIALS OF LIFE AND LEAVE OUT THE POLISHINGS
CHAPTER III--THE TORN DRESS
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYONE OF THE NAME MY BROTHER HAS BEEN IN THE OFFICE OF A MAN OF THAT NAME AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW HIM SLIGHTLY MYSELF
NO TRIAL COULD WELL BE GREATER
IT IS QUITE REFRESHING TO HEAR HER AND TO SEE HER AGAIN HOW TRUE TO HER COLOURS SHE IS SAID EILEEN
WELL I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING OFFENSIVE NOW
HER HEAD WAS PRESSED UPON HER HANDS
COME ANNIE SHE SAID TO MISS COLCHESTER WHO WAS STANDING WITH HER FACE TO THE WINDOW AND HER BACK TO LESLIE HAD YOU NOT BETTER WRAP A SHAWL ABOUT YOU
BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN ON MANY POINTS
I SHOULD CONSIDER SUCH CONDUCT A BREACH OF TRUTH
THIS IS ALWAYS OUR MOST CROWDED TERM
BUT NEITHER CAN I GO AND I WANT YOU TO HELP ME BUT I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
BUT AT LEAST I WON'T DISTURB YOU SHE MOVED SOFTLY TO HER OWN END SAT DOWN ON A CORNER OF HER SOFA-BED AND TAKING UP HER BIBLE READ A VERSE OR TWO BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED
I HAD ONLY FOURTEEN SHILLINGS IN THE WORLD AND I THOUGHT I WOULD GO
I NEED NOT ASK YOU MR PARKER IF YOU WILL OBJECT TO LESLIE BEING ONE OF THE PARTY IN THE CARRIAGE DAN SHALL SIT ON MY KNEE SAID MR PARKER AND TWO OF THE CHILDREN CAN BE CROWDED IN
TO QUOTE YOUR OWN WORDS YOU HAVE COME HERE TO STUDY
I WANT TO BE AWAY BY MYSELF TO FIGHT THIS THING OUT TO THE BITTER END
YOU HAVE DONE FOR YOURSELF NOW I DON'T PITY MYSELF ANSWERED LESLIE
SHE FELT RESTLESS AND UNLIKE HERSELF
BUT ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED HASTILY YOU BOTH DO LOOK DISGRACEFULLY SHABBY WELL LETTIE SAID MARJORIE I DON'T FEEL SHABBY WHICH IS THE MAIN THING
HE SAW HIMSELF AS THE ONE WHO WAS KEEPING THAT HOME
BUT MISS LESLIE I DID THINK THAT YOU--WELL I WILL SAY IT I FELT HURT AT WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY BUT WHAT CAN YOU MEAN
I WANT TO SEE ONE OF YOUR SISTER'S LETTERS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID LLEWELLYN
WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU MRS GILROY AT HOME
THIS SUSPENSE IS ALMOST INTOLERABLE SAID ANNIE
BUT ON THE VERY DAY I WENT ON THE DAY I SAW YOU LAST I MET MY BROTHER
WITHIN AN HOUR THEN YOU HAVE TIME FIRST TO TELL US SOMETHING OF YOUR COLLEGE LIFE I CAN DO SO IF YOU LIKE
YOU ASK SOME OF THE OLDER GIRLS HERE WHAT THEY THINK OF ST WODE'S
IS ANYTHING WRONG OH NOTHING ANSWERED LESLIE
THE BOAT WE ARE TO HAVE THIS AFTERNOON IS THE MERRY ALICE
I DON'T THINK AFTER ALL SHE CONTINUED WE WISH TO BE SO VERY LEARNED
POOR BELLE SAID EILEEN WITH A SIGH
I SINCERELY TRUST--YES MY DEAR I MUST BE FRANK--I SINCERELY TRUST THE WAVE OF HER INFLUENCE WILL NEVER COME INTO MY HOUSE MRS ACHESON SIGHED AND SANK BACK IN HER CHAIR
MARJORIE BELIEVES OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE PRAYED AS SHE DID
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT YES MY DEAR WHEN HE GOES TO INDIA HE SAYS YOU WILL FEEL THE PARTING TERRIBLY
IT GIVES YOU A SORT OF STARVED LOOK STARVED
THERE IF IT WILL MAKE YOU ANY HAPPIER YOU SHALL TELL ME YOUR LITTLE ADVENTURE WHATEVER IT WAS
AND BESIDES IT ONLY WASTES TIME
YOU HAVE A SPLENDID VIEW--MUCH BETTER THAN OURS
MY DEAR MISS LESLIE YOU'LL BE A SORT OF ADOPTED DAUGHTER TO ME
WHAT ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT SAID HIS SISTER
WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT BURGLARS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE WHOLE OF WHAT WAS IMMEDIATELY TO FOLLOW WAS LAID BARE TO HER
LET ME ASSURE YOU ONCE FOR ALL THAT YOUR FAMILY ARE IN THE BEST OF HEALTH
WHY WILL MOTHER ALWAYS INSIST UPON SPOILING A GREAT INTELLECTUAL TREAT WITH THOSE TIRESOME ATTENTIONS TO CREATURE COMFORTS
SHE THEN SHUT THE CAGE-DOOR AND CAME BACK TO WHERE HER FRIEND WAS STANDING
I ONLY TRUST WE HAVE GOT ENOUGH AND THE COLD TEA FOR MOTHER SAID LLEWELLYN
I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY WHAT YOU TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT I ACTUALLY I BELLE ACHESON BEGAN TO PRAY IN REAL EARNEST
HOW SILENT YOU ARE
CHILDREN ONLY EIGHTEEN BUT OLD ENOUGH ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN SHOWING AUNT HELEN TO BE PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN TO ENTER SOCIETY AND TO MARRY IF SUITABLE HUSBANDS COME TO THE FORE OF COURSE
THE PUZZLED MAN WAS STANDING ON HIS HEARTH
SURELY MATHEMATICS OUGHT TO CONDUCE TO ORDER OF MIND AND BODY YOU KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT IT SAID ANNIE CASTING A WITHERING GLANCE AT LESLIE
OF COURSE YOU MUST KNOW IN THE END
BUT I DON'T WISH TO BE LEFT ALONE SHE SAID
SHE WON'T EAT ANYTHING AND ONLY DROPS OFF TO SLEEP WHEN SHE IS TOO TIRED TO STAY AWAKE FOR A MOMENT
THERE IS NO STIMULANT LIKE IT
HE WAS A CLEVER MAN AND HE CONTRIVED ON THE PRESENT OCCASION TO MAKE HIMSELF QUITE BRILLIANT
YOU ARE SHARP ENOUGH TO KNOW MOST THINGS
ON THE CONTRARY I CONSIDER THAT I AM MOST FORBEARING
I CANNOT GO LEW
I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BUT A BODY BEAR ROLL UP AND DOWN AND FILL UP BUT THE ROW TO THIS REMARK BELLE DID NOT DEIGN ANY REPLY
BUT DON'T SPOIL IT BY AN INOPPORTUNE AND INEFFECTUAL LECTURE
GO ALL OF YOU
AND MR PARKER HAS BEEN ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES
ANOTHER TIME I WILL LOCK MY DESK SHE THOUGHT
HE IS THE DECORATOR OF ALL OUR ROOMS
WHO CARES TO KNOW
BUT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DID CAUSE HER A LITTLE SERIOUS THOUGHT
I WONDER IF YOU ARE CLEVER OR WHAT YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR
SHE LOOKED WITH CONSTERNATION AT THE TORN BRAID ON EILEEN'S DRESS
DEAR DEAR IT DOES SEEM A PITY THAT MOTHER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN TO YOU IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY MANNER
IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF RUPERT THE TERRIBLE AND AWFUL THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ONCE MORE BEEN GUILTY THAT HE HAD BROKEN HIS SOLEMN WORD THAT THE POLICE EVEN NOW WERE AT HIS HEELS
SHE COULD NOT WRITE IN REPLY OR SEND HIM A TELEGRAM OR DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM
I SAY--HUMBUG
THERE'S LESLIE SAID MRS GILROY
THE ENTIRE COLLEGE IS TO MEET THERE ON A SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT MATTER
BUT TEA--NO THANK YOU
I WILL SING ROBIN ADAIR IF THAT WILL SUIT YOU I AM FOND OF ROBIN ADAIR SAID THE WIDOW
BELLE IS A DEAR GOOD CREATURE SHE SAID IN A HALF-HESITATING WAY
HE FOUND THAT YOUNG MAN HIDING FROM THE POLICE GAVE HIM SUCH A TALKING TO THAT EVEN HE FELT A LITTLE ASHAMED
AGAIN LESLIE RATTLED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR
ONCE A MOAN AS BITTER AND LADEN WITH SORROW AS THOSE SHE UTTERED IN THE NIGHT BURST FROM HER LIPS
THANK GOODNESS YOU ARE GOING SAID ANNIE
I WILL CALL AGAIN
WHY NOT BECAUSE--OH DON'T ASK ME SHE FELT COLD AND SICK
MR PARKER OPENED THE DOOR
PRESENTLY SHE FLUNG IT DOWN AND UTTERED A HEARTRENDING SIGH
THE PIT
HE WAS JUST STEPPING ON TIPTOE ACROSS THE HALL WHEN A FACE WAS PUSHED OUTSIDE A SITTING-ROOM DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT LETTIE RUSHED UP TO LESLIE
SUPPOSE SHE WROTE TO MR PARKER AND TOLD HIM THE TRUTH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN
I REFER TO YOUR GOOD LOOKS SHE SAID
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL AT TIMES WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE THOUGHTS WHICH SURGE THROUGH MY BRAIN
I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THE NAME
MUCH CHANCE A PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU HAS OF GOING THERE
LETTIE IF YOU WISH FOR ESTHER PLEASE HAVE HER
WHAT MISS SAID THE CLERK ARE YOU ONE OF THE CANDIDATES NO NOT EXACTLY
YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND LESLIE GILROY THERE SAID THE GOOD MERCHANT TO HIMSELF THERE IS HER OWN LETTER--HER OWN STATEMENT IN BLACK AND WHITE
MOTHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE SURELY FOR YOU TO PUT IT TO MR PARKER IN THE RIGHT LIGHT NO LESLIE
SHE NOW TURNED AGAIN TO LESLIE
SEE YOU TO-MORROW LITTLE SIS HE SAID
IF I TAKE HONORS IN MATHEMATICS ALL WILL BE WELL IF NOT DON'T ASK ME ANY MORE MISS GILROY WELL AT LEAST LET ME HELP YOU TO GO TO BED SAID LESLIE
I AM IN LODGINGS WHAT ADDRESS I CANNOT GIVE YOU AN ADDRESS BECAUSE I AM LEAVING TO-DAY THEN THAT IS DELIGHTFUL
I HAVE NOT COME HERE TO BE BETRAYED BY YOU HE SAID
BELLE HUMMED AND HAWED AND LOOKED VERY CROSS BUT FINALLY DID LEAVE THE ROOM
IF SHE MEANS TO TAKE UP HER WHOLE MISSION SHE MUST DROP THAT WHICH HAS HINDERED HER IN THE PAST
IT WAS A CHARMING ROOM FURNISHED WITH EVERY TASTE AND LUXURY
ARE YOU A GREAT FRIEND OF MISS ACHESON'S SHE ASKED
HE HAD NEVER GONE AWAY
I HAVE HEARD FROM ONE OR TWO OF THE GIRLS HERE THAT THE FURNITURE IS PUT IN BY THE HEADS OF THE COLLEGE
ANNIE HAD LAIN DOWN ON HER BED WITHOUT UNDRESSING
THE HEROINE IS A STRANGE SWEET MIXTURE OF PRIDE WILFULNESS AND LOVABLE COURAGE
THE MERE THOUGHT MAKES ME FEEL SICK
IT'S LLEWELLYN I WISH TO HAVE A CHAT WITH
AFTER THE FOURTH OR FIFTH MEETING OF THE TWO PAIRS OF EYES RUPERT GOT UP LEFT HIS SEAT BY MRS ACHESON AND CAME OVER TO WHERE BELLE SAT
COME BACK TO THE BOUDOIR SHE SAID
BY THAT TIME IF I GET THIS SITUATION I SHALL HAVE SAVED MONEY AND BE QUITE INDEPENDENT
I BELIEVE I AM THE HAPPIEST AND I KNOW I AM THE PROUDEST GIRL IN THE WORLD CHAPTER XI ST
IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE PUNISHED AND FOR YOU TO GO SCOT-FREE
YOU GO TO COLLEGE IF YOU WISH IT YOUNG LADY HE SAID AND I HOLD THE PURSE-STRINGS
SOMEONE WAS HEARD WALKING ACROSS IT
BUT WHAT A SCRAPE SHE WILL GET INTO
ARE YOU PREPARED TO APOLOGIZE TO-MORROW OF COURSE I AM
I WILL BE HERE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY
COMING OUT CRIED MARJORIE
BUT RUPERT'S VERY INSOLENCE MADE ANNIE BRAVE
LET KITTY AND MABEL GO IN THE CARRIAGE AND DAN TOO IF THERE IS ROOM AND WILL YOU TAKE HESTER BY TRAIN
SHE MUST SEE MR PARKER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY MAKE FULL CONFESSION AND FLING HERSELF UPON HIS MERCY
HE HAS SECURED AN EXCELLENT POST IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND HAS TO START IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
BUT WHAT A CONDITION THE ROOM WAS IN
THEY DID SO IN MY CASE
ANNIE LOOKING ON FROM AFAR FELT MORE AND MORE DREADFUL EACH MOMENT
AND BEFORE THE GONG FOR DINNER SOUNDED SHE HAD PUT ALL HER BELONGINGS AWAY HAD ARRANGED THE SCREEN ROUND HER WASHHAND-STAND AND HAD EVEN BROUGHT OUT MUCH-LOVED PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER LLEWELLYN TO ORNAMENT THE TOP OF HER CHEST OF DRAWERS
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT MYSELF SAFE
I AM AFRAID YOU MUST BEAR IT AUNT HELEN MRS CHETWYND BURST INTO TEARS
NOW WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU
OH I DECLARE HERE COMES YOUR TRUNK--TWO TRUNKS
OUR HAIR IS BEGINNING TO GROW
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOUR MOTHER WILL THINK THAT IT IS THINK WHAT THAT HE IS TAKING A LIBERTY OF COURSE NOT
SHE OPENED HER EYES
AFTER A MOMENT SHE RAISED HER EYES AND GLANCED AT RUPERT
MISS MARJORIE HAS AN EXACT COUNTERPART AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR
AND THERE'S MY LAST WORD
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO PUT THEIR HAND TO THE PLOUGH AND THEN LOOK BACK I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
THERE IS NO USE WHATEVER IN OPPOSING THEM
HE WILL BE PUT IN PRISON SENT TO PENAL SERVITUDE
THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER IN IT
FINALLY SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO DO SO IN THE MORNING
WELL MY DEAR I WILL TELL YOU THE SIMPLE TRUTH
BUT THAT TERRIBLE CROPPED HAIR--STRAIGHT TOO NOT A SCRAP OF CURL IN IT
HOW DO SHE CRIED
MRS ACHESON WAS KIND TO ANNIE'S BROTHER AND ANNIE'S BROTHER MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF EXTREMELY AGREEABLE
TO WEAR WHAT IS NOT SUITABLE IS THE HEIGHT OF VULGARITY OH DO LISTEN TO HER SAID MARJORIE BURSTING INTO A HEARTY LAUGH
GOOD AS SHE IS SHE IS NOT THE PERSON TO HELP ME IN A GREAT CALAMITY OF THIS SORT
BUT A FELLOW CAN'T THINK OF THEM WHEN HIS MOTHER IS IN THE QUESTION MEANWHILE THE GIRLS DOWNSTAIRS WERE QUICKLY PREPARING THE TEA
LESLIE WAS STANDING BY THE CENTER TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM BUSILY PACKING A BASKET
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU SAID LESLIE IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
BUT AUSTRALIA IS AUSTRALIA AND ENGLAND IS ENGLAND
I HAVE TO USE IT ARIGHT IN INFLUENCING FOR GOOD MY FELLOWMEN
I HAVE ONLY JUST BEGUN TO UNPACK AND EVERYTHING IS HELTER-SKELTER
AND IF I CAN WHEEDLE THAT POOR OLD BELLE OUT OF HER DEN I SHALL FEEL THAT I HAVE ACHIEVED A TRIUMPH
BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWS ALL THE SAME
MRS GILROY JUST GLANCED UP WHEN HER ELDEST DAUGHTER CAME INTO THE ROOM
BY THE WAY WE OUGHT TO MEET MARJORIE AND EILEEN IN THE CENTER HALL BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LESLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
THE SPRING THAT GUIDED MY LIFE IS BROKEN AND UNLIKE THE WATCH IT CAN NEVER BE MENDED YOU FORGET THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A WATCHMAKER
LETITIA WAS A YOUNG LADY QUITE AFTER ESTHER'S OWN HEART
OH IS THAT YOU MY NEW ROOMFELLOW
BUT I BLAME YOU MORE DON'T TELL DON'T TELL CRIED ANNIE
HOW GREAT MIGHT MAN BE IF HE COULD ONLY SOAR HERE BELLE RAISED HER EYES TO THE SKY
WHEN LESLIE PAUSED SHE SAID ABRUPTLY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID LLEWELLYN JUST WHAT I SAY
I'LL SQUEEZE YOU INTO A SEAT BY ME IF YOU LIKE FOR THIS EVENING LESLIE GILROY CHAPTER XIII A COCOA PARTY
NOW GO AND FIND SOME LETTERS OF YOUR SISTER'S
SHE IS LEARNING-MAD
BUT NOW DON'T LET US HARK BACK ON THAT AFFAIR
IT WILL BE LOVELY TO-DAY ON THE RIVER YES SPLENDID SAID LLEWELLYN
DOES IT NOT SEEM ALMOST TOO DELIGHTFUL SPLENDID CRIED MARJORIE
THAT IT DOES HE SUDDENLY LEFT THE ROOM
YOU RAN IN DEBT CHILD
I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE CHETWYNDS THIS MORNING WHERE LESLIE GILROY WAS STAYING WHEN MISS ACHESON ARRIVED AND MOST KINDLY INVITED ME HERE FOR A WEEK
THUS WAS THE FATE OF THE THREE GIRLS QUICKLY DECIDED
BUT NOW MY MIND IS MADE UP QUITE YES QUITE HAVE YOU GIVEN AN ANSWER YET TO MR FORREST PRACTICALLY I HAVE
YOU WILL BE GLAD WHEN THE TERM IS OVER WON'T YOU SHE SAID ABRUPTLY
MR PARKER STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT THE COLOR IN HIS FACE WAS COMING AND GOING
WHEN THEY HEARD THAT SHE HAD PASSED HER LONDON MATRICULATION THEY CONGRATULATED HER AND SAID THAT SHE WOULD BE SURE TO DO WELL AT ST WODE'S
I HAVE NO CONSOLATION BUT ONE OR TWO BOOKS--THE BEST OF FRIENDS
HAVING WRITTEN THE LETTER SHE MADE AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LONDON YESTERDAY AND TOOK IT TO HIM
YOU ARE FORTY IF YOU ARE A DAY AND NO ONE AT FORTY CAN BE CALLED A CHICKEN
YES REPLIED MARJORIE
I WANT HER TO HELP ME WITH THE TRANSLATION OF THE STORY WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE SAYING WHAT DOES HIPPOCLEIDES CARE MRS ACHESON SIGHED AND MADE NO ANSWER
LETITIA IS PRETTY AND FASCINATING OF THE PETIT ORDER
SHE HAS CONFESSED EVERYTHING
HOW SHE SAVED THE MAN SHE FISHES AND PICNICS WITH IN A SPIRIT OF OUTDOOR PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP MAKES A PLEASANT STORY AND A PERFECT CONTRAST TO THE AUTHOR'S MCTEAGUE A SPLENDID AND SUCCESSFUL STORY."--_WASHINGTON TIMES GROSSET DUNLAP PUBLISHERS NEW YORK MEREDITH NICHOLSON'S FASCINATING ROMANCES HANDSOMELY BOUND IN CLOTH
BY SLOW DEGREES HER EFFORTS TOOK EFFECT
HER CHIN RESTED ON HER HANDS
IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY EARLY IN APRIL AND MRS CHETWYND WAS SEATED IN HER LUXURIOUS LONDON DRAWING-ROOM CONVERSING WITH HER SPECIAL FRIEND MRS ACHESON
THUS SHE ADDED CONSIDERABLY TO HER INCOME AND THE CHILDREN NEVER WANTED FOR ANYTHING
I SEE YOU DID NOT WANT TO PAIN ME MR PARKER PATTED HER ON THE ARM
AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PERSUASION THEY WERE INDUCED TO BUY A TABLE AND SOME VERY PLAIN CUPS AND SAUCERS
WE LIKE OUR LIFE AND WE MEAN TO CLING TO IT OH I AM NOT AT ALL ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU DEAR SAID MRS ACHESON
AUNT HELEN IS IN A PAINFUL STATE OF EXCITEMENT WHAT ABOUT WELL NURSE DID NOT MUCH LIKE EILEEN'S STATE AND DR ERICSON CAME IN A HURRY AND HE SAYS HE WISHES ANOTHER DOCTOR TO BE CALLED IN ONE OF THE VERY GREAT SPECIALISTS
MISS GILROY IS ONE OF OUR SPECIAL CHUMS AT COLLEGE AUNT HELEN AND A GREAT FRIEND BOTH OF EILEEN'S AND MARJORIE'S IN THAT CASE SIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO MISS GILROY
HER DRESS A DIRTY SERGE TRAILED ALONG THE FLOOR ONE WISP OF HER THIN HAIR HAD ESCAPED FROM THE LITTLE KNOT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND WAS LYING ON HER SHOULDER
SHE KNEW BELLE QUITE WELL ENOUGH TO BE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS WORSE THAN USELESS TO ARGUE WITH HER
ANNIE ANNIE YOU CANNOT MEAN REALLY TO RUIN ME
SEEING IS BELIEVING NOT I NOT I YOUNG LADY
I CANNOT GO
A MOMENT OR TWO LATER THE HALL-DOOR WAS SHUT BEHIND THE PAIR
I MUST GO AND LOOK FOR HER
MY BEST FRIEND THINKS BADLY OF ME AND I CAN NEVER SET MYSELF RIGHT WITH HIM
MRS ACHESON LOOKED AT ANNIE
AND WHEN I HEARD OF HIS DEATH I FELT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD FOR IT BUT TO WIND UP MY AFFAIRS AND TO HURRY BACK AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
I LIVE IN CONSTANT TERROR OF HER
THAT'S JUST THE VERY POINT WE WISH YOU TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND
IF ANNIE LAY LIKE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLE COLD IN THE MORNING
KNICK-KNACKS ALSO WERE BOUGHT BY THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD A KEEN EYE TO EFFECT
THIS IS OUR GREAT FRIEND MISS GILROY SAID EILEEN IN AN AFFECTIONATE TONE
THERE WERE FOUR HALLS OF RESIDENCE AT ST WODE'S AND BELLE OCCUPIED AN ATTIC IN NORTH HALL
OH I HAVE HAD SUCH AN AWFUL DREAM SHE SAID
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO HARD NO NO SAID LESLIE WITH A CATCH IN HER VOICE AND A SUPPRESSED SOB
HERE SIT CLOSE TO ME DRAW UP YOUR CHAIR NEAR MINE
OH AND HERE WE ARE TURNING IN AT THE GATES
YOU SHALL HAVE THESE LETTERS BACK AGAIN IN A DAY OR TWO AT THE FARTHEST BUT ARE YOU GOING MR PARKER YES
THAT IS THE QUESTION SHE FLUNG OFF HER HAT AND LET IT TUMBLE ON THE FLOOR
MY MOTHER IS A JOURNALIST AND MAKES A VERY GOOD INCOME WITH HER WORK
AND I'LL DO MY BEST FOR YOU WAS THE REPLY
AND WHEN THE MEAL HAD COME TO AN END SHE ASKED LESLIE IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO COME WITH HER TO HER OWN ROOM
TO LEARN WAS HER DELIGHT
YOU MAY BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT EILEEN HAS THE BEST DOCTORS AND THE BEST NURSES WHICH LONDON CAN AFFORD
LET ME SMOOTH OUT THOSE FURROWS ON YOUR DEAR BROW
BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR AH TO LEND YOU ANOTHER SIXTY POUNDS LESLIE'S FACE TURNED VERY WHITE
SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT CONTAIN HERSELF ANOTHER MOMENT
MOTHER DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT MR RUPERT COLCHESTER IS A SCHOLARLY AND GENTLEMANLY MAN YES DEAR BELLE I DO SAID MRS ACHESON
NO REPLIED EILEEN
I SUPPOSE YOU MUST HAVE YOUR WAY
YOU MUST GET IT FOR ME
OH MY CHILD EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE TOPSY-TURVY
THEY HAD BELONGED TO THE SAME REGIMENT
BUT AS WE HAVE NO SECRETS IN OUR FAMILY I WILL TELL IT BEFORE THE REST OF THE CHILDREN LESLIE LOOKED EAGER AND EXCITED
THE FACT IS UP TO THE PRESENT I HAVE NOT DARED TO BREAK THE NEWS TO HER SHE IS SO INTENSELY AFFECTIONATE
DON'T KNEEL LIKE THAT
DO YOU NOT PERSONALLY REPLIED LESLIE
YOUR NAME IS GILROY SAID LESLIE
YOU ANNOY ME MORE THAN WORDS CAN TELL LESLIE WALKED TO HER OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM
THAT WOULD BE QUITE THE LAST STRAW I DON'T THINK SAID BELLE GLANCING IN LETTIE'S DIRECTION THAT THE REMARK OF THE YOUNG PERSON WHO HOLDS THE TILLER-ROPES OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED
WE WERE OUT WITH THE DAVIDSONS ALL THE AFTERNOON AND THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE LATE
THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT AT BURGLARY SHE SHOOK ALL OVER
BUT YOU MARJORIE ARE LAUGHING AT ME INDEED I AM NOT SAID MARJORIE
TO EACH HAS BEEN ACCORDED A STRENGTH HIGHER THAN HER OWN WHICH ENABLES HER TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE THE GOOD
PERHAPS I AM HOT
NOW THE THING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO HELP YOU TO GET ANY MONEY FROM MY FRIENDS THE ACHESONS RUPERT WAS SO MUCH ASTONISHED AT ANNIE'S TONE THAT FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT REPLY
HE CUT THE SQUARE OF GLASS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ENTERED YOUR HOUSE AS A COMMON BURGLAR
YES I'LL DO IT
AWAY WITH SHAMS
YOU MUST GO INTO TRADE TO BE WEALTHY NOW
FROM THE WAY HE SPOKE I RATHER JUDGED THAT HE HAD ONLY JUST GOT HIS APPOINTMENT
THE GIRLS POSITIVELY DECLINED TO BE PRESENTED TO HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY
I WAS VERY MUCH DISTURBED I CAN TELL YOU
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND TO YOU MAY BE GIVEN A GREAT SUCCESS
ANNIE DID NOT SMILE
THE NEXT MOMENT TWO TRIM NEATLY-DRESSED LITTLE GIRLS WITH LONG HAIR HANGING DOWN THEIR SHOULDERS IN DARK-BLUE FROCKS AND WHITE PINAFORES CAME TRIPPING IN
SHE AT LEAST IS THOROUGHLY OUT OF THE COMMON I GRANT YOU THAT ANSWERED LETTIE
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF YOUR KILLING YOURSELF FOR ME
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT COLLEGE GIRLS--THOSE AWFUL UNDERBRED UNWOMANLY CREATURES SAID MRS CHETWYND
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KIND TO YOU--THAT IS I HAVE TRIED TO BE KIND
JANE STOOPED AND APPLIED HER EYE TO THE KEYHOLE BUT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING WITHIN
AND NOW MY DEAR GO TO BED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND LEAVE YOUR SISTER'S CASE IN OUR HANDS AND HE ADDED DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER IN THE HANDS OF A BETTER PHYSICIAN HE LEFT THE ROOM
BEFORE SHE COULD REPLY LESLIE ANSWERED WITH FLASHING EYES
BUT I CAN PROPHESY THAT YOU AND BELLE ACHESON WILL BE FIRM FRIENDS I RESPECT ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY EARNEST SAID LESLIE IN A GRAVE VOICE
I'LL TRUST YOU MABEL YES YOU MAY SHOUTED OUT MABEL
MARJORIE SLEPT FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES THEN WITH A VIOLENT START SHE LOOKED UP SAW LESLIE AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF HER WITH A FIERCE STRAIN
YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE US AN ALLOWANCE AREN'T YOU MOTHER WE WILL TALK OF THAT PRESENTLY MY DEARS
BUT MOTHER DEAR DO LISTEN SAID MARJORIE
YOU ARE NOT MAKING MUCH OF A TOILET THIS EVENING SAID ANNIE
BUT I DON'T QUITE KNOW REPLIED LESLIE
I THINK YOU WILL FIND A SEAT NEXT TO MISS COLCHESTER
SHE OWNED TO A QUALM OF DISGUST HOWEVER WHEN SHE LEARNED THAT LETITIA WAS TO BE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS HERSELF HAVING A THOROUGH SCORN FOR THAT YOUNG LADY
I SHALL GO OFF TO SLEEP--THAT IS ALL I CARE FOR BUT YOUR LETTER DEAR DON'T SAID ANNIE
SHE WAS THANKFUL THAT SHE HAD NOT ASKED ANY FRIENDS TO MEET THE GIRLS ON THEIR FIRST EVENING HOME FROM SCHOOL
YOU WILL THINK BADLY OF ME AND NO WONDER WROTE ANNIE
RUPERT MUST HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT FACT AS HE STOOD WITH BELLE CLOSE TO THE WINDOW
MISS LAUDERDALE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED REPLIED LESLIE IN A MONOTONOUS SORT OF VOICE AND SO WAS MISS FRERE
I AM STARVING
THERE WAS REALLY NO MYSTERY ABOUT IT SAID MARJORIE AFTER A PAUSE
MRS ACHESON ALSO THE WIDOW OF AN INDIAN OFFICER WAS NOT FASHIONABLE IN THE ORDINARY ACCEPTANCE OF THE WORD
IT IS A GOOD THING FOR ME MOTHER AND I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE IN THE ROOM
A GENTLEMAN IS DOWNSTAIRS MISS GILROY SHE SAID
AND DO YOU MEAN TO SAY WE ARE TO HAVE ONE EACH
WE ARE BOTH YOUNG FELLOWS ON THE THRESHOLD OF LIFE
YOU CANNOT MEAN QUITE TO RUIN ME ANNIE TO RUIN YOU--TO RUIN YOU LESLIE
BELLE HAD TAKEN UP A PRAYER-BOOK HAD OPENED IT AND WAS READING IN A SEMI-WHISPER SOME OF THE PRAYERS FOR THE SICK
THERE DARLING THERE SAID LESLIE
BUT SHE GOES TOO FAR FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T LET HER HEAR YOU
IT IS POOR MARJORIE I AM SO TERRIBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT SAID LESLIE
I SAID YOU WERE ILL IF THEY ASK YOU AGAIN YOU WILL TELL THEM AGAIN THAT I WAS REALLY ILL OF COURSE I SHALL
TO DEMAND A FAVOR OF MR PARKER
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ORPHAN AND ALONE I HAVE ONE BROTHER
BUT THERE YOU ARE ONE OF THE UNCO GOOD I AM AFRAID PLEASE DON'T CALL ME THAT SAID LESLIE TEARS NOW VISITING HER PRETTY EYES
YOU MAY TIDY FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE
ONE OF THE WINDOWS STOOD SLIGHTLY OPEN AND THE ROOM WAS FULL OF FRESH AIR WITHOUT DRAUGHT
HOW LONG WOULD BELLE KEEP HER AS A GUEST
SHE IS IN A ROOM WITH A DREADFUL CREATURE OF THE NAME OF ANNIE COLCHESTER HOW PRETTY MISS GILROY IS SAID LETTIE
I AM PLEASED TO SEE YOU IN THAT PLAIN SERGE DRESS
SHE APPROACHED EILEEN AND ALMOST GLARED INTO HER FACE
HE CALLED OUT COME IN AND HIS SISTER LESLIE ENTERED
SHE WILL ASK YOU NOT TO BE TOO BITTERLY HARD SAID POOR ANNIE
I HAVE COME TO YOU ON THAT ACCOUNT FOR YOU CAN HELP ME
MY HEART IS WRUNG
YES THEY WERE BOTH SINGULARLY HANDSOME GIRLS AND VERY LIKE ONE ANOTHER
THE GILROY CHILDREN WERE ALL IN THE WILDEST STATE OF EXCITEMENT
OH IF I MIGHT ONLY DIE THE MISERABLE GIRL FELL ON HER KNEES BURYING HER FACE IN A CHAIR NEAR BY
DO YOU KNOW ANY PEOPLE MISS CHETWYND NOT A SOUL SAID MARJORIE SINKING DOWN UPON A CORNER OF JANE'S SOFA AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO SHE ADDED
I ONLY TOOK AN ORDINARY AND MY PROSPECTS WERE MORE OR LESS RUINED
IT IS THE CUSTOM AND YOU MUST SUBMIT
NOW DO GO TO BED AND DON'T ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS
WELL YES MY DEAR
PUT IT AWAY PLEASE SHE PUSHED IT FROM HER
MOTHER DOES NOT YET KNOW OF MY DARLING SCHEME
EVEN FOR THE HUMAN WATCH SAID LESLIE HER TONE SOFTENING
SHE HAD TAKEN AN ENORMOUS FAVOR FROM HIS HANDS
I WILL UNPACK YOUR THINGS AND SEE WHAT ARE MOST SUITABLE SAID THE MAID IN HER PRIM VOICE
MY HEART DOES GO PIT-A-PAT LESLIE'S FACE ALSO BECAME SUFFUSED WITH PINK AS THE CABMAN DREW UP AT THE LARGE WOODEN GATES WHICH WERE PRESENTLY OPENED BY A NEATLY DRESSED YOUNG WOMAN WHO LIVED AT THE LODGE JUST WITHIN
I KNOW MOTHER WON'T FOR A LONG LONG TIME I'LL GO AND ASK THEN SAID LESLIE JUMPING UP
IT IS SO HOT THAT YOU WILL FEEL YOURSELF A REAL MARTYR
SHE SHALL BE MY HOUSEKEEPER UNTIL SHE ENTERS A GOOD HOME OF HER OWN
GUILTY
HE WAS ASHAMED OF HIS TEARS
IT IS ALL IN HIS HANDS
YOU ARE TO HAVE EVERY ADVANTAGE THAT IS POSSIBLE
HE WILL HEAR
HER EYES WERE NOW SHUT
I CAME TO YOU TO CONFESS NOT KNOWING THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO EXPOSE ME
HE MADE NOTHING OF IT
ONE OF THE GIRLS IS VERY ILL AND THE OTHER WON'T DO WITHOUT LESLIE I'M NOT SPECIALLY SURPRISED AT THAT SAID THE MERCHANT
WELL I SUBMIT
IN THESE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE GROW OLD SO TERRIBLY FAST GIRLS OUGHT TO HAVE THEIR SO-CALLED EDUCATION FINISHED AT EIGHTEEN MY DEAR BELLE WOULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU SAID MRS ACHESON
BUT THEY ARE ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION DOING WELL
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
MAY I ASK YOU WHICH LIFE YOU MEAN TO CHOOSE--THE FULL OR THE EMPTY I SHALL CERTAINLY AIM FOR THE FULL LIFE REPLIED LESLIE IN SOME ASTONISHMENT
THERE WAS NO ANSWER
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD MEET YOU ON THE ROAD HOME HE SAID
JANE LOOKED AT HER WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
BUT OF COURSE AS YOU SAY IT IS NOT MY AFFAIR IT CERTAINLY IS NOT AND I TRUST YOU WON'T INTERFERE FURTHER IN THE MATTER
I MUST RETURN TO MY DARLING AND BY SO DOING BE DREADFULLY SELFISH AND INJURE HER SAID LESLIE
AND NOW GO TO BED OLD GIRL FOR I AM HALF DEAD WITH SLEEP KISS ME FIRST SHE SAID
HE HAD BROKEN HIS WORD TO LESLIE
AFTER A TIME ANNIE SEEMED TO FEEL THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM PRESSURE
SHE IS ALSO VERY MUCH DEPRESSED UNNATURALLY SO
I HAVE SAVED HER FROM THAT
ALL THIS EMOTION IS WASTE--WASTE OF SYMPATHY I AM SORRY BUT I MUST GIVE IT SAID LESLIE
I MUST GO AND BRAVE HIM ALONE
I WILL NEVER TELL YOUR MOTHER
ARE NOT YOU AS GLAD AS I AM LLEWELLYN RESPONDED TO LESLIE'S INVITATION UNWILLINGLY
I CANNOT GO THIS EVENING SAID ANNIE
I BELIEVE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO LET THEM TO YOU
YOU MUST PROMISE THAT YOU WILL ON NO ACCOUNT ENCROACH ON MY HALF OF THE ROOM
SHE KNOWS ALSO THAT YOU DO NOT LIKE HER BROTHER SCOUNDREL MUTTERED THE MERCHANT BETWEEN HIS TEETH
I AM TOO FULL OF MY OWN AFFAIRS TO BE BOTHERED BY YOUR MINOR TROUBLES THAT IS SO LIKE YOU RUPERT
EVEN THE PENCE ARE NOT TO BE DESPISED
THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY LOCKED UP AND THE LOWER PART IN DARKNESS BUT SHE KNEW A SIDE-DOOR BY WHICH SHE COULD GET OUT
YES YOU ALSO WOULD DO WELL
I AM A STRANGER TO YOU
YOU WERE IN GREAT TROUBLE AND I PITIED YOU FROM MY VERY SOUL
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I AM A LITTLE JEALOUS OF YOU FOR YOU KNOW YOU ARE SO WONDERFULLY PRETTY AND YOU ARE SO KIND TO EVERYONE
IT WILL TAKE ME AT LEAST AS LONG TO EXPLAIN THE MATTER
I AM WORKING HARD TERRIBLY HARD
HE SAT DOWN NEAR HER
YES SHE DID IT AND MR PARKER THINKS THAT I AM GUILTY
WHO IS THAT YOUNG PERSON SAID BELLE RAISING HER VERY SHORT-SIGHTED EYES AND STARING HARD AT LETTIE
I AM GOING TO KEEP THIS THING TO MYSELF
THERE IS A MYSTERY SOMEWHERE
THEN GLANCING ROUND THE WALLS FINALLY SETTLED THEM ON THE MUCH-WORN CARPET AT HER FEET
A MOMENT LATER SHE LEFT THE ROOM
THEN WHAT IS IT YOU WANT MY BOY PARKER WENT UP AND CLAPPED HIS HAND HEAVILY ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER
THE MAID QUICKLY PUT THE CONTENTS OF THE SMALL TRUNKS INTO THE RECEPTACLES FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE LAID TWO SOILED AND CRUMPLED EVENING-FROCKS OF PALE CREAM CASHMERE ON THE BEDS AND THEN RETIRED TO EXPEND SOME OF HER SKILL WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE ON LETITIA'S PRETTY PERSON AND CHARMING WARDROBE
TO EACH OF YOU IN YOUR STRENGTH IS GIVEN BY GOD A WEAK BROTHER TO LOOK AFTER ONE WHO HAS NOT GOT YOUR OPPORTUNITIES WHO HAS NOT GOT YOUR WEALTH WHO HAS NOT GOT YOUR COMFORTS AND LUXURIES IN LIFE
HER GLOVES WERE ALSO WHITE AND HER LITTLE SHOES HAD SMART BOWS AND BUCKLES
I THOUGHT NATURALLY SHE WOULD ARRIVE SHE DOES NOT LOOK VERY WELL BELLE
I PAY FOR IT AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO IT THE UNEXPECTED WORDS OF SPIRIT CAUSED ANNIE TO BECOME A LITTLE LESS RUDE
NOR IS YOURS MARJORIE
A CHEERY YOUNG WOMAN OF ABOUT SEVEN-AND-TWENTY PRESENTLY MADE HER APPEARANCE ASKED THEM THEIR NAMES TOLD THEM THAT THEIR TRUNKS WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEIR ROOMS AS SOON AS EVER THEY ARRIVED AND THEN REQUESTED THEM TO FOLLOW HER
I CANNOT QUARREL WITH YOU NOR ARGUE WITH YOU ANY LONGER
HE WAS THE GREATEST CLASSICAL SCHOLAR AT HARVARD COLLEGE NEAR BOSTON BELLE COULD NOT HELP BLUSHING WITH INTENSE GRATIFICATION
I DON'T WANT TO SEE SAID LESLIE
WE KNOW SO MANY GIRLS WE ENTER INTO THEIR LIVES WE HAVE A DELIGHTFUL FEELING OF COMRADESHIP
I WANT TO BE ALONE WITH YOU LESLIE LETTIE RAISED HER BROWS MADE A PANTOMIMIC SIGN TO LESLIE TO SHOW HOW BADLY SHE WAS APPRECIATED AND STOLE ON TIPTOE OUT OF THE ROOM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MOTHER LLEWELLYN WAS ALL LIFE AND SPIRITS IN A MOMENT
I LOVED HIM AND I HAD DREAMS ABOUT HIM
I SHOULD NOT HAVE GOT INTO THIS AWFUL SCRAPE IF I HAD NOT BEEN GOOD TO HER
OH IF ONLY MOTHER WERE ALIVE LOOK HERE ANNIE NONE OF THAT SAID COLCHESTER HIS VOICE BECOMING SO STERN THAT POOR ANNIE NEARLY SHOOK
WELL HE WISHES TO DO SOMETHING FOR--FOR THE SAKE OF HIS OLD FRIEND MRS GILROY'S VOICE FALTERED
MISS COLCHESTER IS A VERY PECULIAR GIRL
NO ONLY A GREAT FRIEND
A FRIEND OF FATHER'S
I COULD GO BY TRAIN BUT A HANSOM WILL TAKE ME QUICKER HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
I'LL HAVE A RIGHT GOOD TALK WITH THEM SO TRY NOT TO FRET
I DON'T THINK SHE CAN BE MUCH WORSE
I COULD NOT FIND YOUR MOTHER AND NURSE TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GIVING ME LEAVE OH OF COURSE YOU MAY STAY
IT WAS VERY THIN AND OF AN ANTIQUE SHAPE AND THE CHILDREN WERE OFTEN HEARD TO DECLARE THAT NOTHING WOULD INDUCE THEM TO HAVE THEIR TEA MADE IN ANYTHING ELSE
Y
I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO MISS LAUDERDALE AND REPRESENTED THE CASE TO HER
I WILL GO TO BELLE ACHESON NOW
BY THE WAY DO YOU OBJECT TO US ALSO COMING WITH YOU TO EAST HALL THIS EVENING I SHALL BE VERY GLAD REPLIED LESLIE
HE DOES NOT WANT TO HELP BOYS HE SAYS
NOW I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SHE SAID TURNING IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY TO ANNIE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER SHALL SEE AS MUCH OF EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE WHILE YOU ARE WITH ME
DON'T ASK ME IN JENNY'S NAME FOR JENNY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT SORT OF THING
WHAT IS IT DEAR SAID LESLIE WITH SYMPATHY
I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM ANY MORE HER TONE WAS COLD CALM AND LOW
I SIMPLY DON'T KNOW
PRAY DON'T SAY ANY MORE TO ME
IT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT SAID EILEEN
THANK YOU MISS GILROY FOR COMING
CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY IDEA WHY SHE HAS BEEN ABSENT TO-NIGHT I DON'T THINK SHE IS QUITE WELL REPLIED LESLIE
WHICH WITH A FEW DO EVER LIVE AND MOVE AND WORK AND STIR
MY SISTER SAID LLEWELLYN DRAWING HIMSELF UP AND FLUSHING ANGRILY
I THINK THERE ARE A FEW WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN ANYTHING OF A PRIVATE NATURE
THE COLD ALMOST DISDAINFUL LOOK HE HAD GIVEN HER THE EFFORT TO APPEAR AS USUAL BEFORE HER MOTHER AND BROTHER AND SISTERS THE SIGNAL FAILURE OF THAT EFFORT KEPT COMING BACK TO HER
HOW CAN I ASK HIM TO DO ME A FAVOR
YES I MUST FIND HER WITHOUT DELAY LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM
IF ONE THINKS OF IT IN THAT WAY ONE NEED NEVER BE VAIN AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME THAT YOU THINK YOURSELF GOOD-LOOKING I DO ANSWERED LESLIE CALMLY
BUT WHAT A FUNNY WAY THEY DO THEIR HAIR
BUT IT'S RATHER A BIG ORDER
BUT HE GOT QUITE WELL AGAIN AS STRONG AS EVER
HE SAYS THE WRITINGS ARE NOT IDENTICAL THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME PERSON
DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT CONTINUED ANNIE
ANNIE IS A VERY CLEVER GIRL
I SUPPOSE GIRLS ALL BUT ONE AND HER I WON'T MENTION IN THIS DISCUSSION ARE ALIKE ALL THE WORLD OVER
BUT HER SISTER HER TWIN SISTER IS IN THE OTHER ROOM AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW AND CANNOT FIND OUT I UNDERSTAND
I WONDER NOW HE SAID COMING A STEP OR TWO FORWARD IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ME ABOUT ON THE SLY FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO
THE ATMOSPHERE IS CONVINCING
SHE WAS DRAWING BROWN COTTON GLOVES ON HER HANDS WHEN THE INTRODUCTION TO LESLIE WAS MADE
I FELT HER HAND TOO AND IT WAS VERY HOT
KITTY WENT TO THE KITCHEN TO FETCH THE TRAY WITH THE CUPS AND SAUCERS
THERE IS NO KEY IN THIS LOCK
BELLE HER DAUGHTER IS A VERY ODD CLEVER CREATURE
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE THE BOX WHEN I SHOWED MYSELF THE BOX CHILD
WELL I'M COMING AGAIN
WE WILL HAVE OUR OWN SPIRIT-STOVE AND A SAUCEPAN AND I WILL BUY MILK AND COCOA
HOW CAN I YOU WILL NOT INSERT THE THIN END OF THE WEDGE
CLOSING THE DOOR HE ASKED HER TO SEAT HERSELF
I AM NOT GOOD NOW NOT AT ALL
UNTIL THEN SHE WOULD REMAIN IN HER OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM NOTWITHSTANDING ANNIE'S OBJECTION TO HER DOING SO
I MUST HURRY BACK TO TOWN AS FAST AS EVER I CAN
I EXPECT I SHALL KNOW ALL THE NICEST GIRLS IN THE PLACE
BUT THERE PERHAPS THIS IS A TEMPTATION
I SIMPLY FEEL THAT I CANNOT BETRAY YOU THEN ALL IS WELL SAID ANNIE
BUT LESLIE WHEN YOU HAVE DONE WITH HER BRING HER OR SEND HER BACK TO ME
WE MUST ALL GO DOWN TO DEBATE WITHIN AN HOUR SAID JANE
OH IT IS A CRUEL A CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT YOU WILL LIVE THROUGH IT SAID LETTIE
THIS IS A DEBT I OWE MA'AM
HE MAY BE SAVED EVEN AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR
ANNIE WAS IF POSSIBLE EVEN MORE ASSIDUOUS IN HER STUDIES
YOU HAVE PUT THE MATTER INTO GOD'S HANDS--YOU ARE RESTING ON GOD
QUITE FOLLOW
AND THAT APPALLING GIRL FOR THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR HER OF COURSE THE WORLD DID TURN TOPSY-TURVY TWENTY YEARS AGO SAID EILEEN
OH RUPERT WHY WERE YOU AND I LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD AND WHY--WHY DID YOU TURN OUT BAD AND WHY DO I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THE DRIVE WAS OVER AND THE TIME ARRIVED WHEN ANNIE WAS TO SET OFF TO MEET RUPERT IN REGENT'S PARK
SHE FOUND HERSELF ALL OF A SUDDEN THROUGH NO FAULT OF HER OWN IN THE POSITION OF ONE WHO IS DEGRADED DISHONORED
I RESPECT YOU BOY
THERE CAME A RING AT THE HALL-DOOR AND MRS ACHESON AND THE REDOUBTABLE BELLE WERE USHERED IN
I SEE MYSELF AS I SHALL BE DURING ALL THE COMING YEARS ON TO THE DECLINE OF LIFE ABSORBING MORE AND MORE KNOWLEDGE LIVING ABOVE THE WORLD
I AM JANE HERIOT
WHAT CAN SHE HAVE COME ABOUT OH DO LET HER IN
A PICTURE OF THE NEW WEST AT ONCE STARTLINGLY AND ATTRACTIVELY TRUE
ANNIE HELD OUT BOTH HER HANDS TO HIM
YOU WILL EXAMINE THE LETTERS AND LET ME KNOW THE RESULT TO-MORROW MORNING MR ESSEX PROMISED AND THE MERCHANT WENT AWAY
SHE WENT UP TO MRS ACHESON
BUT I AM MISTAKEN
IN IT BUT NOT OF IT BUT YOU WON'T BE IN IT WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR HOSTEL SAID ANNIE WITH A GLEAM OF HUMOR IN HER SAD EYES
SURELY YOU DID NOT WANT ME TO VISIT YOU TO DISCUSS MY LOOKS BY NO MEANS
YOU WANT TO BE MY SECRETARY I COULD DO THE WORK WELL SAID ANNIE STANDING UP AND SPEAKING WITH GLISTENING EYES
AND YET THESE TWO GIRLS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR DRESS WERE NOT LOOKED AT TWICE DURING THAT JOURNEY WHEREAS LETITIA WAS THE CYNOSURE OF MANY ADMIRING EYES
BUT YOU ARE NOT THE SORT WHO WILL GO OVER TO THE BELLE ACHESON SIDE I DON'T THINK I SHALL REPLIED LESLIE GENTLY
THEN THEY GIVE ENDLESS COCOA PARTIES HERE AND YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO TAKE YOUR SHARE I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL REPLIED EILEEN
A SICK BRAIN NEVER GETS ANYTHING REALLY WORTH HAVING
FOR SOME DAY HE MUST HAVE TIME TO PURSUE HIS BELOVED CLASSICS AND HIS LITERATURE AND ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH HE CARES FOR
ANNIE ATE HEARTILY AND FELT CONSIDERABLY REFRESHED AFTERWARDS
SHE LIVES IN A WONDERFUL AND STRANGE WORLD OF HER OWN
AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE CHETWYNDS
BUT IN GOD'S HAND ALONE ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE SHE STOLE BACK TO THE SICK-ROOM AND LESLIE RETURNED TO MARJORIE
DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD
THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CANDLES
SHE WORE ALSO A VERY NARROW GOLD CHAIN ROUND HER NECK
I HATE TO HAVE MY PAPERS AND LETTERS LOOKED OVER
HE LAID HIS HAND LIGHTLY ON HIS SISTER'S SHOULDER
WHEN LESLIE ENTERED HER ROOM ANNIE STILL BURIED IN HER NOVEL WAS CROUCHED UP ON THE WINDOW-SILL
NOW PLEASE GET INTO BED
HOW OLD IS THE LAST BABY
IF YOU DON'T--WHY YOU CAN KEEP AS LONELY AS YOU LIKE
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE ADDED A FEW THINGS FOR I LIKE PRETTY ROOMS
HER BEDSTEAD TURNED INTO A SOFA BY DAY BY MEANS OF A CRIMSON RUG WAS NOW TIDY AND IN ORDER AND LESLIE SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF IT WAITING FOR ANNIE COLCHESTER TO STIR
I HAVE SOMETHING I SPECIALLY WISH TO SAY TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT OF A LIFE OF ABSOLUTE DEVOTION
MARJORIE KNELT IN THE MIDDLE
REMEMBER WHATEVER YOU DO MUST BE DONE TO-DAY
SHE SUBMITTED TO HER ROOMFELLOW'S MINISTRATIONS AT NIGHT GULPING DOWN THE CUP OF HOT COCOA WHICH LESLIE EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESENTED TO HER DRINKING IT IT IS TRUE AS ONE IN A DREAM HER RED-BROWN EYES LOOKING FAR AHEAD OF HER HER HEAVY BROWS CONTRACTED IN AN ANXIOUS FROWN
WE HAVE A CHEST OF DRAWERS EACH AND PROPER WASHHAND-STANDS OF COURSE AND SNUG LITTLE SOFA-BEDS AND CARPETS AND CURTAINS TO THE WINDOWS AND NEED YOU QUOTE ANY FURTHER FROM THAT TIRESOME LIST SAID BELLE AGAIN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LUNCHEON THAT DAY JUST AS THE GIRLS WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE THE DINING-HALL MISS PENROSE THE PRINCIPAL OF SOUTH HALL WHO ALWAYS SAT AT A LITTLE TABLE WITH A FEW FAVORED PUPILS STOOD UP AND SOUNDED A SILVER GONG
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IF MARJORIE AND EILEEN WENT ON IN THIS PECULIAR MANNER WHICH THEY HAD DONE THAT EVENING
LESLIE MY DEAR WHAT IS WRONG FOR LESLIE HAD SQUEEZED HIS ARM SO TIGHTLY THAT THE LAD WINCED
LESLIE DID NOT TAKE THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE
POOR AS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TO BE HE WAS BY NO MEANS SHABBILY DRESSED
CHEER UP CHEER UP BUT LESLIE COULD NOT UTTER A WORD SHE DID NOT EVEN RAISE HER HEAD
YOURS IS A VERY GREAT TEMPTATION SHE SAID AT LAST SLOWLY
AFTER ALL IT DOES NOT MATTER SHE SAID TO HERSELF
I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF SAYING THINGS I DON'T MEAN
BELLE IS AWAY IS SHE NOT SHE COMES HOME TO-MORROW NIGHT
PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT SAID LESLIE IN A THOUGHTFUL VOICE
NOW HOW CAN I AMUSE YOU WE DON'T WANT AMUSING SAID EILEEN
I COULD NEVER BE A DRONE EVEN IF I WISHED IT LEW--NOT EVEN TO PLEASE YOU DEAR OLD FELLOW THE MOTHER BENT FORWARD AS SHE SPOKE AND GAVE THE BOY ONE OF HER RARE CARESSES JUST A TOUCH ON HIS WHITE FOREHEAD
OH GIRLS IT IS GRAND TO ALLOW YOUR MIND TO SOAR
GOOD-BY MARJORIE--GOOD-BY LESLIE SHE TURNED AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET
YOU HAVE UTTERLY FORSAKEN ME NO
THINK OF THEM AUNT HELEN ALONE WITH BELLE ACHESON THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY SAID MRS CHETWYND
HIS MCTEAGUE SETTLED HIS RIGHT TO A PLACE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
LESLIE GOT OUT ONE OF HER OWN HANDKERCHIEFS WRUNG IT OUT OF COLD WATER AND LAID IT UPON ANNIE'S BROW
THEY HAD PLENTY OF INTELLECT AND THEY COULD EXPOUND THEIR VIEWS IN A SIMPLE AND YET TELLING MANNER
SHE CANNOT BE GOT TO LEAVE EILEEN'S ROOM
OH DON'T FORGET WHATEVER HAPPENS THE OTHER BASKET WITH THE GINGER BEER AND LEMONADE
WHATEVER YOU MAY DO IN THE FUTURE PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I AM YOUR FIRST COUSIN ALMOST YOUR SISTER AND WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER ALL OUR LIVES OF COURSE DEAR LETTIE WE WILL BOTH COME SAID EILEEN
I FIND THESE MODERN LANGUAGES SO VERY STIFF WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING NOW ASKED ANNIE
LESLIE YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT A LOAD WILL BE LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND YOU WILL HAVE DONE IT
ANNIE'S FACE WAS GHASTLY PALE
I WANT TO SLEEP
I WILL SHOW YOU THE LIST OF BOOKS I HAVE TO GET THROUGH
WE HAVE COME HOME AND MOTHER WISHES US TO GO INTO SOCIETY--POOR DEAR LITTLE MOTHER THE BEST OF SOULS
THE THING WILL BE OUT OF THE COMMON
A SQUARE WAS QUICKLY CUT OUT A HAND AND ARM INTRUDED THEMSELVES AND THE HASP THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHICH HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO RUPERT BY BELLE WAS QUICKLY UNFASTENED
ANNIE YOU EXPECT TOO MUCH ANNIE STARED VERY HARD AT LESLIE
IF YOU TWO ARE READY SHE CALLED OUT WE MAY AS WELL START COMING IN A MOMENT JANE ANSWERED LESLIE
KEEP YOUR OWN COUNSEL THAT IS ALL I ASK OF YOU AS ANNIE SPOKE SHE STARTED UP REMOVING HER JACKET AND GOING TO HER TOILET TABLE BEGAN TO ARRANGE HER FUZZY LOCKS
YES THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM NOW
I AM GLAD YOU ARE BACK AGAIN
THERE WAS A STAMPING OF FEET WHEN SHE SAT DOWN
I'LL BE LOCKED UP
IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU DON'T LEAVE ST WODE'S ANNIE I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BE YOUR ROOMFELLOW AGAIN NEXT TERM DO YOU MEAN IT SAID ANNIE A FLASH OF LIGHT COMING INTO HER EYES AND THEN LEAVING THEM
WE ARE NOT AT ALL SETTLED IN OUR OWN MINDS AS TO WHAT WE WILL DO YET
CLEVER OF ME--EH VERY CLEVER ANSWERED ANNIE WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE
YOU HAVE MADE MY LIFE ALL GALL AND BITTERNESS OH FOLLY SAID ANNIE
SHE MUST BE A WELL-INFORMED WOMAN SHE DOES KNOW A FEW THINGS SAID LESLIE TRYING TO SUPPRESS A SMILE
SHE THEN LOCKED THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR AND SLIPPED THE KEY INTO HER POCKET
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SHE SAID
YOU SEE UNLESS ONE HAS GENIUS THERE IS NOT THE LEAST USE IN THE PRESENT DAY IN BEING MUSICAL
POSITIVELY IT'S ENOUGH TO SICKEN A FELLOW
IF YOU CAN TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE POOR IN WINGFIELD OR WHAT PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETIES ARE STARTED OR IF THERE ARE CLASSES FOR THE TEACHING OF COOKERY AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY WE SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU BUT WHY DID YOU COME HERE SAID JANE OPENING HER EYES WIDE
WHAT IS IT LESLIE SHE SAID
THERE WAS A DEEP FRIEZE OF HAND-PAINTED FLOWERS AND BIRDS
IT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN HER LIFE
SHE LOOKED AT MARJORIE
DON'T LIKE A DEAR GIRL WORRY OVER THE THING ANY LONGER
SHE HESITATED ON THE SECOND LANDING WHERE HER OWN ROOM WAS
IT WILL BE VERY STRANGE
BUT WHY--WHY HOW CAN YOU ASK ME WHY HE ANSWERED
FRESHERS
GOOD-BY LITERATURE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
BUT IT IS TRUE
I ALWAYS CONSIDERED HER THE FINEST SWEETEST GIRL I HAD EVER COME ACROSS LIKE VERY LIKE ONE WHOM I HAVE LOST
BUT IF THEY HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE LONDON MATRICULATION OR THE CAMBRIDGE HIGHER LOCAL OR THE MY DEAR MY DEAR CRIED MRS ACHESON YOU ARE POSITIVELY BEWILDERING MY DEAR FRIEND
BUT THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO LEAVE HER FOR THE PRESENT WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL ROUND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
MY HEART HAS BEEN COLD AS A STONE TO YOU
SHE UTTERED A GROAN AS SHE SPOKE
NOW YOU--WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS LESLIE GILROY YOU LESLIE GILROY WHAT A VERY BOOKY NAME HAVE A MEDITATIVE FACE
EVEN MOTHER DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THIS BOX CONTAINS
MR PARKER DOES NOT LIKE TO OWN IT
OH NEVER MIND OUR HANDS
I KNOW MR PARKER DOES NOT LIKE ME AND HE NEVER LIKED RUPERT
LOCK THE DOOR WILL YOU AT ONCE LESLIE INSTANTLY TURNED THE WELL-OILED KEY IN THE LOCK
BECAUSE THOUGH YOU ARE FASHIONABLE AND HORRIBLY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT YOUR OUTWARD APPEARANCE YOU LOVE US SO WELL THAT YOU COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT US THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN THAT SAID LETITIA WITH A SIGH
THIS THING THAT ANNIE HAS DONE ON ACCOUNT OF YOU HAS TURNED BOTH MY PRESENT AND MY FUTURE INTO GALL AND BITTERNESS
THE OPENER'S SPEECH WAS MADE BY MISS FRERE WHO BOLDLY THREW DOWN THE GAUNTLET REMINDED THE GIRLS ASSEMBLED BEFORE HER OF SOME OF THE PERILS WHICH LAY ACROSS THEIR PATHS AND ASSURED THEM THAT THE OLD GRACES OF POLITENESS OF GENTLENESS OF LOVING SERVICE OF ALL THAT MADE WOMAN NOBLE AND GRACEFUL OUGHT TO BE PART OF THE NEW LIFE WHICH WAS OPENING ITS DOORS WIDER AND WIDER EACH DAY FOR THE HAPPY MODERN GIRL
AND OF COURSE I BELIEVE SHE CONTINUED
LETITIA WHAT A PITY IT IS YOU ARE NOT MY OWN CHILD FOR SOME REASONS I WISH I WERE AUNT HELEN YOU ARE SO VERY NEAT DEAR SO VERY DAINTY--THAT IS THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
IT IS TOO BAD SHE SIGHED HEAVILY AS SHE SPOKE DRAGGED HERSELF ACROSS THE ROOM AND ONCE MORE GOT INTO BED
NOW RUPERT YOU KNOW MY DECISION YES IT IS TRUE WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID
YOU THINK ME SILLY NOW DEAR BUT YOU WON'T WHEN I HAVE SUCCEEDED
IT DOES NOT MATTER NOW IN THE VERY LEAST WHETHER YOU EXPOSE ME OR NOT FOR I AM GOING TO EXPOSE MYSELF
DOUBTLESS LIFE WILL TEACH THEM ITS OWN LESSON AND THEY WILL BE DELIGHTFUL WHEN THEY RETURN FROM ST WODE'S HOW LONG MUST THEY STAY THERE ASKED MRS CHETWYND
NOTHING REPLIED BELLE
I HAVE FORGOTTEN A HANDKERCHIEF SHE RAN BACK JUST WHEN THEY REACHED THE DOOR
COME WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
WHEN YOU TOUCH THIS HANDLE YOU TURN ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
I TOO HAVE MADE UP MY MIND INTERRUPTED EILEEN
BUT I MUST FIRST GO OUT WITH LESLIE GILROY OFF WITH YOU THEN AT ONCE
SHE NOW LAID HER HAND ON ANNIE'S SHOULDER DREW HER TO HER SIDE AND KISSED HER TENDERLY ON HER FOREHEAD
AND OH YOUR GLOVES--THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A HOLE IN THE THUMB OF THE ONE ON YOUR LEFT HAND
MISS LESLIE GILROY HAS FOUND OUT THAT FACT FOR HERSELF ALREADY
SHE LOOKED UP AND TRIED TO SPEAK IN A CHEERFUL TONE
BUT THEY WILL NOT DO SO TO-NIGHT AS IT IS THE FIRST NIGHT OF TERM
AND AS TO POOR WRETCHED FOWLER IF YOU THINK HE ENJOYS TALKING ABOUT HIS LATEST BABY AND THE MEDICINES HIS WIFE IS TO TAKE AT KING'S CROSS STATION YOU ARE VASTLY MISTAKEN
I SAW THAT THE MOMENT YOU ENTERED THE ROOM AND I AM TRULY SORRY I AM YOUR ROOMFELLOW FOR I KNOW I SHALL WORRY YOU TERRIBLY
AND NOW PRAY ANN TAKE THIS CHAIR AND LET US GET THROUGH OUR WORK THEY DID SO
YOU NEED SOME LESSONS IN LIFE OH DON'T DON'T SAID BELLE PUTTING HER FINGERS TO HER EARS
YOU BRAVE DARLING DON'T SAID LESLIE
I WANT TO KNOW SAID LESLIE--SHE PAUSED
REALLY WHEN EVERYTHING WAS CONSIDERED THEY WERE VERY LITTLE BETTER THAN BELLE AND BELLE HAPPENED TO BE MRS CHETWYND'S BETE NOIRE
BUT AS TO LEARNING WE DON'T WANT TO BE BOOKWORMS IN THAT CASE WHY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN HAVE I BEEN ASKED OVER HERE CRIED BELLE
I WILL HAVE A TALK WITH YOU AFTER DINNER IF YOU LIKE MISS GILROY THANK YOU I SHALL BE VERY GLAD REPLIED LESLIE
SHE WILL BE GOING TO MEET THAT BAD FELLOW TO GIVE HIM THE MONEY--THE MONEY WHICH HAS RUINED MY LIFE
I AM SURE MOTHER WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM HE IS COMING TO SEE ME THIS EVENING SAID ANNIE HER HEART IN HER MOUTH
OH DARLING LITTLE MAMMY WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED MARJORIE
ANNIE COLCHESTER DO YOU EAT ENOUGH DON'T QUESTION ME ANSWERED ANNIE
IT WAS ANNIE COLCHESTER WHO CAME TO ME
YOU ARE A FRESHER YOU KNOW THIS TERM AND WILL BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY BUT HOW ARE FRESHERS TREATED AND WHY MUST I BE GIVEN THAT UNPLEASANT NAME ASKED LESLIE
BUT I WILL NOT CONSENT TO DRAG EITHER YOU OR MYSELF ANY LOWER
THE MERE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMEONE WOULD SO REGARD HER TROUBLED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE WONDERED IF IN THE FUTURE SHE COULD LEAD AN UPRIGHT LIFE
IF YOU LEAVE THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING FULFILLED THAT TERRIBLE AND YET GRAND OBLIGATION YOU WILL THROUGH ALL ETERNITY FEEL THE LOSS OF WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE GAINED FINALLY THE PRINCIPAL SAT DOWN AMID LOUD CHEERING
SHE WILL BLESS YOU PLEASE PLEASE NURSE TELL ME BEFORE I GO HOW EILEEN REALLY IS THE NURSE SHOOK HER HEAD
NO MY DARLING NOT TO-NIGHT
AND SHE KNEW IT
IS IT SAFE TO LEAVE SO MUCH MONEY ABOUT IN THAT CARELESS WAY SAID ANNIE WHO THOUGHT OF HER OWN FOUR SHILLINGS AND QUITE SHIVERED AS BELLE LIFTED OUT THREE CANVAS BAGS
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT HER
LETTIE THEN ROSE AND SHUT THE PIANO
BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW YOU
SHE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD BIT OF AN ODDITY AND IN THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE DOUBTLESS NEGLECTED HER FOOD
WE WILL SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
HOW DARE YOU INTERFERE SHE SAID HER EYES FLASHING
MR NORRIS CONCEIVED THE AMBITIOUS IDEA OF WRITING A TRILOGY OF NOVELS WHICH TAKEN TOGETHER SHALL SYMBOLIZE AMERICAN LIFE AS A WHOLE WITH ALL ITS HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS AND ITS TENDENCIES THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE CONTINENT
WHAT AWFUL CREATURES ONE MEETS NOW AND THEN
WHAT DID YOU SAY
MAMMY WE DECLINE TO GO INTO SOCIETY WE DECLINE TO TURN NIGHT INTO DAY WE DECLINE TO SPEND UNNECESSARY MONEY UPON CLOTHES AND WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO MARJORIE
YOU ARE GOOD SHE REPEATED
LESLIE THOUGHT SHE WOULD WAIT THERE IN ORDER TO MEET HER
IT IS A GREAT CHANCE FOR YOU LESLIE
WE MUST FIND A BARBER TO-MORROW IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR CROPS TO THE RIGHT LENGTH AN INCH AND A HALF BEING THE LENGTH PERMITTED SAID MARJORIE WITH A SMILE
I AM STILL AS FOND AS EVER OF MY STUDIES
THE THOUGHT THAT MR PARKER ALSO SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS VAIN ENOUGH AND DESPICABLE ENOUGH TO GO INTO DEBT FOR FINE CLOTHES RETURNED TO HER MEMORY WITH ANNIE'S WORDS
HER HEAD ACHED AND SHE SCARCELY KNEW HER OWN SENSATIONS
THERE ARE NO TWO SIDES CRIED BELLE
DON'T YOU SEE THAT MY THINGS ARE EVERYWHERE
SEE HERE LLEWELLYN HAVE YOU GOT A LETTER OF YOUR SISTER'S HANDY A LETTER
I AM GOING TO GET INTO BED AND TO REMAIN PERFECTLY QUIET AND YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME ONE QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING
YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ANYTHING FIT TO BE SEEN FROM SCHOOL
THEY ARE FRESHERS LIKE YOURSELF ARE THEY NOT I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM REPLIED LESLIE
YOUR BROWS ARE CAPABLE OF EXPANSION YOUR EYES ARE CAPABLE OF ACQUIRING DEPTH YOUR HEAR
ANNIE SWITCHED ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
DO--DO LET ME ANNIE COLCHESTER NOW TURNED SLOWLY ROUND
I AM TOLD THAT HE OFFERS HIS SECRETARY TWO GUINEAS A WEEK
LESLIE REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR A FEW MINUTES
YOU KNOW THE OLD ADDRESS IN MAIDA VALE
DEAR MR PARKER
LET THE THOUGHT SINK DEEP
YOU REMIND ME OF MY OWN GIRL HE SAID
SHE WAS SEATED AT THE HEAD OF HER TABLE POURING OUT TEA
NOW DO COME TO MY ROOM FOUR OTHER GIRLS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN MISS HERIOT'S ROOM
AFTER ANNIE AND LESLIE HAD LEFT HIM MR PARKER RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE
IT FACED THE RIVER
LESLIE HAD TO TAKE A FEW SWIMMING LESSONS BEFORE SHE COULD DO SO
I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE BEGAN
HOW GLAD I AM I DID NOT BUY THAT NEW SUMMER DRESS SAID BELLE
BUT I HAVE COME HERE TO STUDY
THAT IS IF YOU CARE TO CONFIDE IN ME I BELIEVE POOR ANNIE IS DREADFULLY UNHAPPY POOR DEAR PERHAPS SHE IS
BUT IF SHE EXHAUSTED HERSELF IN THE WAY SHE WAS DOING SHE MIGHT BE LAID UP WITH A SEVERE NERVOUS ATTACK
BUT I EXPECT SHE WILL HAVE A BAD TIME POOR DEAR WITH MISS COLCHESTER
I HAVE QUITE CHANGED MY MIND
I THINK YOUR MOTHER WOULD SEND YOU TO ONE OF THOSE NEW-FANGLED WOMEN'S COLLEGES IF YOU LIKED IT
LOOK OUT FOR ME AND DON'T FAIL HE NODDED AND WALKED AWAY
IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE A SOOTHING TOUCH THE THING TO REMEMBER JUST NOW SAID LESLIE SPEAKING AS BRIGHTLY AS SHE COULD IS THAT IT IS ALMOST TWELVE O'CLOCK
I SHALL MAKE MYSELF AS CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT AS I CAN IN THE FUTURE
MARJORIE JUST LET ME PLACE MY FINGER ON YOUR BROW
I AM HER TWIN YOU KNOW AND TWINS ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER FIFTY TIMES CLOSER THAN THE ORDINARY BROTHER AND SISTER
YOU DID VERY WRONG TO GO INTO DEBT
NOW HERE WE HAVE HEAPS OF OPPORTUNITIES
LET US QUOTE FROM LONGFELLOW NOW
IT IS MAGNIFICENT
AND THE GIRLS WHATEVER HAPPENS SHALL HAVE A GOOD TIME
CHAPTER XVII--THE MERRY ALICE CHAPTER XVIII--THE GUILD OF ST
IT WAS FROM RUPERT AND RAN AS FOLLOWS
ANNIE CLUTCHED HOLD OF THE NEAREST CHAIR TO STEADY HERSELF
BUT I CANNOT PERMIT IT
YOU SEE ALL THE GIRLS EXCEPT EILEEN AND MARJORIE LAUGH AT HER AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE HER WORSE I DON'T QUITE GO THE LENGTH OF LAUGHING AT HER SAID JANE IN A THOUGHTFUL VOICE
EILEEN AND MARJORIE ARE ALIKE IN APPEARANCE AND STRIKINGLY HANDSOME
CHAPTER IV IN THE GIRLS BEDROOMS
IT IS TRUE THAT I DREAD THE GOVERNORS VISITING MY ROOM AND ORDERING SOME OF THOSE USELESS ARTICLES WHICH THE OTHER GIRLS WEAKEN THEIR CHARACTERS BY USING
BUT THERE I WILL ADD NO MORE I TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH YOU CRIED LESLIE
MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD AN OLD-FASHIONED SCHOOLROOM AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE THEY HAD CLEANED IT OUT THEMSELVES AND PUT IT INTO ORDER ACCORDING TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL TASTES
AS SHE HAD ALREADY PASSED THE LONDON MATRICULATION THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT HER ADMISSION AS SOON AS ROOM COULD BE FOUND FOR HER
IT WILL DO YOU NO END OF GOOD ALL RIGHT DARLING
I WILL KEEP THE POST OPEN FOR FORTY-EIGHT HOURS BUT NO LONGER
LESLIE NODDED TO HER AND TURNED AWAY
A STORY OF CHICAGO
WELL DEARS I WILL WAIT FOR YOU THREE FOR EXACTLY TWENTY MINUTES SAID MRS GILROY
COME IF YOU WISH TO DO SO
POOR THING THOUGHT LESLIE
LESLIE AND BELLE THUS FOUND THEMSELVES FACING EACH OTHER
AND I KNOW I CAN BUOY HER UP WITH HOPE FOR MY INTENTION IS THAT SHE SHALL JOIN ME IN A YEAR OR TWO
EXCELLENT
EXCELLENT
ANNIE MUST BE SAVED
BUT NOBODY STARED IN AT ALL AN UNPLEASANT MANNER
I KNOW EVERYTHING
I SHALL THANK YOU TO THE LONGEST DAY I LIVE BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT SAID LESLIE
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT IN THE ROOM PLAYED ON IT AND BROUGHT OUT SOME OF ITS RED FIRE
BUT AS I HAVE ONLY BARELY TAKEN AN ORDINARY ALL THAT SORT OF THING IS HOPELESS
HE SEEMED TO BE DRAGGING THE TRUTH OUT OF HER SOUL
BUT IT IS FEVER--TYPHOID OR TYPHUS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
YOU WILL ALL LOVE TO COME TO ME
SHE CLUNG TO LESLIE AND WOULD SCARCELY LET HER OUT OF HER SIGHT
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY COME BACK SOME DAY A RICH MAN
SHE WILL NOT FEEL IT SO DREADFULLY AFTER A LITTLE
I CAN SEE THAT MOTHER IS GOING TO LET THE VIALS OF HER WRATH LOOSE
HE WILL LOOK AT IT EVEN WHILE HE IS TALKING WITH ANOTHER PERSON OH HOW GOOD YOU ARE WHISPERED ANNIE IN HER EAR
BUT SHE WAS NOT REALLY THINKING OF HERSELF NOR HER OWN INCONVENIENCE
WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF A MAID WHEN GIRLS WENT TO BED IN SUCH A STATE OF UNTIDINESS
MARJORIE WAS NOW SITTING UP ON THE BED
HOW LUCKY THAT I WAS IN SHE SAID
I CAN LIVE AT HOME TOO AND HALF THE MONEY WILL GO STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE HOUSE
BELLE'S GRAY EYES TRAVELED TO LESLIE'S FACE
WE WON'T SPEND ANY OF THAT MONEY ON DRESS
THAT'S MY ADVICE LET IT GO
TAKE OF FLOUR ONE OUNCE BUTTER CREAM THREE EGGS AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING EILEEN SAID THE MOTHER
BUT MY DEAR I NEVER KNEW THERE WERE VALUABLES IN THE BOX
SURELY THERE ARE UNTIDY GIRLS IN THE COLLEGE
NOT NOW SHE SAID
IS THERE ANY WAY IN WHICH I CAN COMFORT HER
I WANT TO HELP MOTHER AND I WILL HE SAID STOUTLY
CHAPTER XXVII--TELL ME THE TRUTH LESLIE
I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE SHE CONTINUED GLANCING FROM ONE GIRL TO THE OTHER TO SLEEP IN THE ROOM WITH A GENIUS AND MUST PROVIDE ACCORDINGLY IT IS SUCH A PITY YOU CANNOT HAVE A ROOM TO YOURSELF SAID EILEEN
I SHALL BE IF YOU WILL SPEAK A GOOD WORD FOR ME
WHAT A BLESSING FOR YOU WHISPERED LETTIE BENDING FORWARD FROM HER PLACE IN THE STERN
THERE THEY STOOD IN THEIR SHABBY DRESSES A LITTLE PIECE OF EILEEN'S PETTICOAT PEEPING BELOW HER SKIRT THEIR SHORT HAIR PUSHED UP FROM THEIR FOREHEADS THEIR HANDSOME FACES ALIGHT WITH FIRE AND EXCITEMENT
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF MONEY IF YOU CANNOT SPEND IT NOW AND THEN
THINK OF THE OLD TIMES
MISS ANNIE LITTLE KNOWS WHAT A TRAP SHE HAS GOT INTO
WHY NEED WE PAMPER THE BODY
SHE IS THE MOST WORLDLY-WISE LITTLE SOUL THAT I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.--NOW LETTIE DON'T BE A HUMBUG
I MEAN TO EARN THAT MONEY
IS IT TRUE HE SAID
CAN ANYTHING BE DONE TO PREVENT IT SAID MRS CHETWYND ON THE MORNING OF THE FATAL DAY
NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF REST ABOUT HER FACE THAT LESLIE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THERE
HER BROW WAS WET WITH PERSPIRATION
I WISH TOO YOU WOULD NOT OPEN YOUR EYES SO WIDE
HOW PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS YOU ARE
IT WAS AT THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE SQUARE
THEY ARE SO DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER WELL REALLY LESLIE TO BE PLAIN WITH YOU MARJORIE IS IN A VERY EXTRAORDINARY STATE
SHE TURNED AT ONCE AND THE GIRLS WALKED DOWN THE STREET SIDE BY SIDE
HER HEART BEAT FAST
WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING REPEATED LESLIE AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
CHAPTER IV--IN THE GIRLS BEDROOMS
YES DEAR MY SIGHT IS BAD
I NEVER HEARD OF MR PARKER UNTIL HALF AN HOUR AGO AND NOW HE IS AN IMMENSE FACTOR IN MY LIFE HER WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE PARLOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND MR PARKER ACCOMPANIED BY LLEWELLYN ENTERED
THEY ARE SURE TO INVITE YOU TO THEM
IT IS SO HOT TO-NIGHT SHE SAID
HE IS INTERVIEWING SOME YOUNG LADIES FOR A OH I KNOW SAID ANNIE WHO HAD FOLLOWED LESLIE ACROSS THE ROOM
MY WORDS WILL SINK DEEP I KNOW MY PRETTY LITTLE ANNIE
ANNIE COLCHESTER IS HERE
THEY OFTEN MIND WHAT I SAY WHEN THEY WON'T MIND THEIR ELDERS
HE HATED ANNIE COLCHESTER AND YET FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS SOUL HE PITIED HER
INSTEAD OF THAT HE HAS HIS SIX FOOT OF EARTH--HIS SIX FOOT OF EARTH MA'AM--JUST WHAT WE ALL WILL COME TO SOME DAY
SHE CAME UP CLOSE TO RUPERT COLCHESTER AND STARED HIM FULL IN THE FACE
MAY I BRING HER WITH ME MRS CHETWYND LONGED TO SAY NO SHE DISLIKED BELLE ACHESON SHE DISLIKED HER MANNERS AND HER MODE OF LIFE AND SHE DID NOT WISH HER TO EXERCISE THE SMALLEST INFLUENCE OVER LETITIA EILEEN AND MARJORIE
AT LAST SOON AFTER TEN O'CLOCK HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
OFTEN IN MY MOMENTS OF FRENZY HAVE I JUMPED UP SUDDENLY AND PULLED THE CLOTH WITH ME
I SPEAK FOR EILEEN AS WELL AS FOR MYSELF.--YOU AGREE WITH ME EILEEN DON'T YOU OF COURSE REPLIED EILEEN
YOU ARE SAYING SOMETHING
IF THE TERMS OF THE WILL BE VIOLATED THE HOUSE GOES TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHOM THE WILL FURTHERMORE FORBIDS HIM TO MARRY
YOU MUST HEAR ME OUT CONTINUED LESLIE
WE MUST TALK IN THE STREETS
PERHAPS IT WAS MRS ACHESON'S KINDNESS
NOBODY CAN GUESS THE SECRET AND THE WHOLE PLOT MOVES ALONG WITH AN EXCITING ZIP
SHE DID NOT SPEAK OF IT AS YOU HAVE DONE MISS HERIOT MAY I KNOW THE NAME OF THAT GIRL ASKED JANE
THEY HAD THEIR WORK MARKED OUT FOR THEM THE LECTURES THEY WERE TO ATTEND WERE DEFINITELY ARRANGED THE BOOKS THEY WERE TO READ WERE SELECTED SOME FROM THE LIBRARY SOME FROM GREEN'S IN THE BROAD
THE NOISE OF PEOPLE WALKING OVERHEAD WAS HEARD
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE HIM DO IT AND I THINK HE WAS WRONG WHAT WAS IT
THERE WAS A SORT OF WIND IN THE ROOM
DON'T HAUNT ME WITH IT A MOMENT LONGER
WHAT IS MORE SIR I WOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING LLEWELLYN SAID HIS MOTHER
AND I DO NOT WISH MOTHER TO KNOW UNTIL SHE GETS TO RICHMOND WELL OF COURSE I'LL MANAGE IT IF IT MUST BE MANAGED SAID LLEWELLYN
I SHAN'T SLAVE SO HARD OVER BOOKS EITHER
YES I WILL SAY IT FRANKLY IF THERE IS A CREATURE IN THE WIDE WORLD I THOROUGHLY DESPISE IT IS MAN IN HIS FIRST ADOLESCENCE AT LUNCH BELLE MENTIONED TO HER MOTHER THAT ANNIE COLCHESTER HAD A BROTHER AND THAT HE PROPOSED TO CALL THAT EVENING
WHERE HAVE YOU BOTH BEEN SHE CRIED
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO DOWN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM TO MOTHER AND MRS ACHESON
IT IS THE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR FOREHEAD
AND ONE DAY I GOT OUT OF MY DEPTH BEFORE I COULD SWIM QUITE WELL AND HE PULLED ME TO SHORE
GOOD-NIGHT LESLIE
AFTER ALL THESE NEW-FANGLED IDEAS THAT WOMEN HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF ARE MOST DISASTROUS
IT IS BETTER TO MAKE CONFESSION BEFORE OPEN DETECTION IS IT NOT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING CONTINUED ANNIE
JUST FEEL MY BROW SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF LESLIE'S SLIM HAND AND HELD IT TO HER FOREHEAD
HE SPOKE CRUELLY TO YOU
THINK SO
SHE THEN TURNED TO LESLIE
YOU ALONE CAN HELP ME
SHE BURST INTO A BITTER FLOOD OF TEARS FLUNG HER ARMS ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK AND LAID HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED GIRLS WERE IN THE GREAT DINING HALL
MOTHER SAYS YOU ARE RICH AND IF IT IS REALLY AS YOU SAY AND FATHER LAID HIS BOND UPON YOU IT DOES NOT SEEM TOO HARD
THEY WERE STANDING IN THE ATTIC WHICH SHE HAD DESCRIBED TO THEM SO GRAPHICALLY
I CANNOT CANNOT BEAR IT SHE REPEATED AT INTERVALS
SHE LOOKED AROUND IT AS SHE SPOKE GLANCING AT THE CURTAINED WINDOWS THE PICTURED WALLS THE COMFORTABLE CHAIR IN WHICH LESLIE WAS SEATED
I AM PRACTICALLY A TEETOTALER HE THEN DREW A CHAIR NEAR BELLE'S SIDE AND CONTRIVED TO DRAW HER INTO A LITERARY CONVERSATION OF DEEP INTEREST
WAS IT AN ORDINARY DEBT YOU WANTED THE MONEY FOR LESLIE BENT HER HEAD IN APPARENT ACQUIESCENCE
I HOPE TO CONVERT HER TO MY VIEWS IN THE LONG RUN THAT YOU NEVER WILL SAID ANNIE
I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF YOU WITH A SHOP SHE CRIED WITH THAT BRAIN AND THOSE EYES
I HAVE A CHAIR BESIDES THE ONE I OCCUPY CONTINUED BELLE
ARE YOU NOT GLAD I CANNOT QUITE REALIZE IT SAID ANNIE
OUR FATHER WHO WAS A GREAT SCHOLAR IF HE WERE TO COME BACK AND IF HE COULD SPEAK TO ME I AM QUITE CERTAIN HE WOULD SAY THAT I WAS MORE WORTHY TO BE HIS SON IF I HELPED THE MOTHER QUICKLY THAN IF I DID ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED THE BOY
AND WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT MOTHER
LETTIE YOU ARE PERFECTLY AWFUL WELL I'M NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELF DARLING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
WE WERE BROUGHT UP DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF OUR LIFE BY A GUARDIAN WHO HAS SINCE DIED WELL AT ANY RATE I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR BROTHER ANNIE SAID BELLE FROM THE FAR END OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS READING SOCRATES
BUT HALF THE GOOD OF THE PLACE IS ITS SOCIAL LIFE
THAT SIGH REACHED LESLIE
JUST AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME A WELCOME INTERRUPTION IN THE SHAPE OF TEA
YOU CALL ME BELLE AND YOU ONLY MET ME FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK ME PRESUMING SAID LESLIE--SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO BELLE AS SHE SPOKE--"BUT I FEEL SOMEHOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FRIENDS BELLE'S THIN HAND WAS IMMEDIATELY OUTSTRETCHED AND FOR AN INSTANT SHE CLASPED LESLIE'S--SHE THEN LET IT DROP WITH A SIGH
SHE IS HARD ALREADY
WHY I DO DECLARE MY DEAR SHE EXCLAIMED ONE WOULD THINK YOU HAD HALF-A-DOZEN OF YOUR OWN YOU HANDLE THE LITTLE MITE THAT KNOWINGLY OH IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE CHILDREN REPLIED THE GIRL
I EXPECT THAT CHAP WILL GO TO THE DOGS AS FAST AS HE CAN
I CAN SEE THAT AT A GLANCE
I HURRIED DOWN WHEN YOU ALIGHTED AND HAVE FOLLOWED YOU
I AM MISTAKEN IN HER
SHE DID NOT COME TO THE MEETING
CAN I FIND OUT
WODE'S COLLEGE
WODE'S COLLEGE
I HAVE ALSO INJURED ONE OF THE BEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD
DIDN'T YOU GET ON WITH YOUR PUPILS NO THEY WERE CONTRARY
SHE BELONGS TO THE DEAD AND GONE WOMAN WHO NEVER DID ANYTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF IN HER LIFE YOU ARE VASTLY MISTAKEN SAID LESLIE WITH SPIRIT
ALL THE TALK WAS INTELLIGENT AND BRIGHT
THE GIRLS DREW LESLIE INTO THEIR MIDST HOLDING OUT AFFECTIONATE HANDS OF COMRADESHIP
I DO WISH WE COULD COMFORT YOU DEAR OLD MAMMY
WOMAN HAS GOT TO CHOOSE
HAVING FINISHED THE FUGUE WHICH TOOK A CONSIDERABLE TIME THE YOUNG GIRL ROSE FROM THE PIANO AMID A PROFOUND SILENCE
I WON'T DISTURB THAT POOR DEAR SCHOLARLY GIRL
EILEEN STAYED BEHIND
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT FAILURE OF YOURS
I HAVE READ ALL ABOUT IT
NOW SPEAK UP AND BE QUICK
DO STEP ASIDE BELLE AND LET ME LOOK OUT IF YOU WISH TO SAID BELLE DREARILY
LLEWELLYN WAS LIKE THAT ONCE OR TWICE AND I ALWAYS GOT HIM TO SLEEP IN THAT FASHION
I KNOW YOU MEAN KINDLY MISS ACHESON SAID LESLIE WHO COULD NEVER BEAR TO DISTRESS ANYONE
MOTHERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE OVER THEIR OWN CHILDREN
SHE HOPED NO ONE NOTICED HER AGITATION
SHE RETURNED HER PURSE TO HER POCKET AND LOOKED AGAIN AT LESLIE
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE WOULD LIKE BETTER THAN TO GO THROUGH ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES
I SHALL BELIEVE IN GOD NOW AS LONG AS EVER I LIVE
SHE MUST GO ON WITH WHAT SHE MEANT TO DO AT ANY COST
DON'T KEEP ME NOW BELLE
THE MUSIC OF THE ORDINARY SCHOOL-GIRL AFTER YEARS OF TOIL IS MERELY REGARDED AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND GENERALLY AS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
YOU DO LOOK VERY QUEER
AND OH LEW
MARJORIE HAD FLUNG HERSELF DOWN IN A CHAIR AND COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS
HE HAD BEEN SAD HE HAD BEEN JOCULAR IN ANNIE'S PRESENCE DURING THIS SHORT INTERVIEW
A SCOUNDREL OH HE IS MY BROTHER CRIED ANNIE
WHY SO ASKED LESLIE
WE WOULDN'T MISS THE DEBATE TO-NIGHT FOR A THOUSAND WORLDS
I WILL SEND ROUND TO MARCHAND'S FOR A LANDAU
NOW IF SHE WERE TO TAKE EXTRACT OF MALT OR FELLOWES SYRUP OH DO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE CRIED LETITIA
AND JANE TURNING TO LESLIE REMINDED HER THAT SHE HAD PROMISED TO JOIN THE COCOA PARTY IN HER ROOM
BUT I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE
SHE SAID THE STUDENTS ROOMS WERE SO SWEETLY PRETTY AND THAT EACH GIRL COULD EXERCISE HER OWN INDIVIDUAL TASTE GOOD GRACIOUS
WHAT IN THE WIDE WORLD AM I TO WRITE TO HER ABOUT TO GET ALL THE NECESSARY PARTICULARS AS WE WANT TO GO TO ST WODE'S AT THE BEGINNING OF TERM OH MY CHILD I CANNOT PERMIT IT SAID MRS CHETWYND
IT HAS TO DO WITH LESLIE
I CAN NEVER TOUCH HIS HAND YOU ARE TOO HARD SAID ANNIE
THAT IS ALL I REQUIRE FOR THE PRESENT
BUT OF LATE SINCE HER OWN GREAT TROUBLE HAD COME SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN TO PRAY AND NOW IT SEEMED DIFFICULT
IT WAS BRAVE SHE PUT HER ARMS ROUND ANNIE'S NECK AND BEGAN TO KISS HER
I MUST GO BACK
THE IDEA OF MAKING HER APPEAR TO WRITE TO YOU FOR MONEY CAME INTO MY BRAIN AND WOULD NOT GO AWAY AGAIN
OMNIBUSES GO FROM THERE IN ALL DIRECTIONS
BUT DO NOT LET US TALK ANY MORE ABOUT PERSONAL APPEARANCE
BUT LESLIE HAD ALREADY STOLEN INTO HER HEART
BUT NOW WE WILL TALK NO MORE OF THIS
I MEAN TO HUNT HER UP
AND AS THERE HAPPENED TO BE A PLACE IN THE CAB FOR A FOURTH AND LESLIE WAS STANDING LOOKING JUST A LITTLE FORLORN ON THE PLATFORM MARJORIE WENT UP TO HER AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL GO TOGETHER
HUDSON DON'T EXPECT ME BACK TO-DAY
ALAS
THE OMNIBUS DREW UP SHE ALIGHTED AND TURNED FORLORNLY INTO THE SQUARE WHERE BELLE LIVED WITH HER MOTHER
LESLIE IS OF COURSE DELIGHTED
MY BROTHER YOUR BROTHER IS IN AUSTRALIA NEVER MIND WHERE HE IS
IF I COULD SAY
MISERABLE AS ANNIE FELT THERE WAS A STRANGE GLOW AT HER HEART THE COLOR HAD FLAMED INTO HER PALE CHEEKS AND LIGHT INTO HER RED-BROWN EYES
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE IS QUITE WELL AND I WISH SHE WOULD NOT WORK SO HARD
ALL WOMANLINESS EXTRACTED OUT OF THEM--MERE WALKING INTELLECTS WITH NO HEARTS OF ANY SORT YOU REALLY DO RUN TO THE FAIR WITH THE THING REPLIED MRS ACHESON
SHE LET HER LITTLE HAND LIE IN HIS FOR HALF A MOMENT AND THEN WITHDREW IT
NOT SHE ADDED THAT I FEEL UNKINDLY TOWARDS HER AND I REALLY DID TRY TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER UNFORTUNATE WARDROBE
LESLIE MOVED AWAY TO A LITTLE DISTANCE
YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME SAID MISS COLCHESTER JUMPING UP COMING FORWARD AND GAZING HARD AT LESLIE
SHE HAD TAKEN A DEEP INTEREST IN ANNIE
LESLIE WENT TO HER OWN ROOM SECURED THE KEY SLIPPED IT INTO HER POCKET AND JOINED THE REST ON THE THRESHOLD OF JANE'S ROOM
HE SEEMED TO THINK WE WERE IN DANGER WITH THE DRAWING-ROOM WINDOW SO CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND LOOKING INTO THE GARDEN
I WAS LOOKING FOR A PAPER OF MINE SHE SAID WHICH I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE GOT AMONGST YOURS
HE IS PAYING ALL MY FEES
HOW DO YOU DO SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HER FRIEND
I AM ABOUT TO QUOTE FROM THE GREAT WORK OF SAMUEL DANIEL WHO WAS BORN AT TAUNTON IN SOMERSETSHIRE IN 1562 AND DIED IN 1619
LESLIE'S PERSUASIONS JOINED PERHAPS TO SOME OF LETTIE'S TARTER REMARKS INDUCED MARJORIE TO TAKE A LITTLE FOOD
OH HAPPY HAPPY MAIDENS
GO CHILD
OH YOU ANGEL
BELLE WAS AN INMATE OF ST WODE'S COLLEGE WINGFIELD
GIVE ME THE EVERYDAY SORT OF CHARACTER
OR ARE YOU TOO ABSORBED WITH THIS--THIS WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO NOTICE THAT I AM ONE OF THE ST WODE'S GIRLS OF COURSE I KNOW YOU
MY DEAR ANNIE
I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD WRITE A BETTER LEADER THAN SHE AND AS TO HER PARS THEY ARE QUITE THE BEST THE GRAPHO EVER RECEIVES DOES YOUR MOTHER WRITE FOR THE GRAPHO YES AND FOR SEVERAL OTHER LEADING PAPERS
I AM JUST WHERE I ALWAYS WAS
AND NOW SHE WAS STAINED JUST AS IF SHE HAD REALLY COMMITTED THE SIN WHICH SHE LOATHED
HOW PERFECTLY FEARFUL
BUT I AM REALLY SORRY FOR HER WAS LESLIE'S GENTLE RESPONSE
WHEN I WAS WITH THEM AT SCHOOL THEY RATHER DEFERRED TO MY OPINION ON CERTAIN MATTERS BUT NOW ALL THINGS ARE CHANGED DON'T STAND TALKING THERE DEAR
I WANT YOU TO MAKE ANNIE YOUR SECRETARY SHE SAID
I SAW YOU STANDING THERE AND THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WANTED SOMETHING SHE SAID
I HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO LESLIE AND TO LLEWELLYN BY THEMSELVES CHAPTER IX ONE TAKEN THE OTHER LEFT
AND EILEEN--PETTICOAT OUT OF ORDER
A WORD MAY SINK IN A TONE MAY HAVE AN EFFECT
BUT IN GOD'S HANDS ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE OH THEN IT IS HOPELESS SAID MARJORIE
IF EVERYBODY ELSE WAS QUITE AS EARNEST AND SINCERE WHAT A DIFFERENT WORLD IT WOULD BE WHAT AN APPALLING WORLD IT WOULD BE EXCLAIMED LETTIE
THAT I AM FOLLOWED AND ARRESTED
BUT I DO WISH BEFORE MOTHER BEGINS THAT YOU WOULD SHOW ME KITTY HOW YOU TURN THIS HEEL
BY AND BY SHE WOULD SEE IT ALL AND SPEAK OF IT BUT NOT JUST NOW
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT I AM DRIVING AT NOTHING SAID BELLE IN A VOICE OF DIGNITY
SHE SHALL COME AND LIVE AT MY MOTHER'S AND SHE SHALL WORK FOR YOU
I WANT YOU AND SHE TO MEET ME IN THE BROAD WALK IN REGENT'S PARK BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE THIS AFTERNOON
BUT I AM QUITE CERTAIN THE ACHESONS ARE NOT RICH IS THIS BELLE ONE OF THE ST WODE'S UNDERGRADUATES YES THEN OF COURSE THEY MUST BE RICH OR SHE COULD NOT GO TO A PLACE LIKE WINGFIELD
BUT ALL THE SAME CONTINUED THE MOTHER YOU MUST NOT BLAME MR PARKER
THERE IS ALSO A BENCH ON WHICH I AM NOW SITTING
AFTER A TIME ANNIE SLIGHTLY MOVED HER POSITION AND STOLE ONE ARM SOFTLY ROUND LESLIE'S NECK
LET US GO AT ONCE
IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO TO COLLEGE IN COMPANY
WHAT DO THEY MATTER
YOU LOOK QUEER I WILL GO UPSTAIRS AND LIE DOWN LESLIE RAN PAST EILEEN WHO STARED AFTER HER IN SOME WONDER
UNTIL YOU ARE OF AGE IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY ME
SHE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF OURS
IT IS ALL RIGHT
THAT WILL BRING ME IN THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR AND MY FOOD AND AFTER A BIT I MIGHT DO EVEN BETTER
THERE WERE GILROY'S BONDS THAT HE HAD LAID UPON ME AND I HAD TO SEE TO IT THAT I OBEYED THE LAST WORDS HE EVER SAID TO ME
BUT NOW LESLIE NOW IF YOU COULD SEE THEM--THEY HAVE A SORT OF SPIRIT-LOOK
I ALSO WANT TO LEAD THE EARNEST LIFE DO YOU
I BESEECH OF YOU DEAR SHE SAID NOT TO LEAVE THE CHILDREN ALONE WITH THAT PERNICIOUS GIRL
I DO WISH THIS COTTON WOULDN'T BREAK SO GIVE IT TO ME SAID LESLIE
I WILL TELL YOU WHY IF YOU ALL WANT TO KNOW SAID LLEWELLYN
AFTER THE MEETING AT EAST HALL I CAME BACK TO OUR ROOM AND FOUND YOU ABSENT
ONE OF MY GLASSES IS BROKEN AND I WHO HAVE ASTIGMATISM IN ONE EYE CANNOT GET IT MENDED IN A HURRY
GILROY SAID TO ME PARKER NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE CHANCES OF LIFE ARE
THAT PRECIOUS GOODY-GOODY MISS GILROY LITTLE KNEW HOW CLOSE I WAS TO HER VICINITY WHEN SHE BADE YOU GOOD-BY AT THE BANK OH RUPERT I AM SO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
I KNEW AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS FORGERY
BUT UNDER THE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS AYE
FOR A MOMENT LESLIE FELT QUITE ALARMED
ANNIE WHO WAS BURIED NOT IN HER STUDIES BUT IN A NOVEL DID NOT EVEN LOOK UP
OH HOW COULD YOU WHISPERED LETTIE
AND REMEMBER WE HAVE PRAYED ABOUT IT SAID LESLIE
SHE HAS NOT BETRAYED US
OH LESLIE WHAT SHOULD I DO IF YOU WERE NOT WITH ME
I WONDER MOTHER HAS NOT COME IN IS NOT SHE IN ASKED LESLIE STANDING UP TO HER FULL HEIGHT AND PRESSING HER HAND TO HER FOREHEAD
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE THE PRETTIER VIEW OH HOW LOVELY EXCLAIMED EILEEN
I AM GOING OUT FOR A STROLL
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A COLLEGE IS IT THIS IS ONE OF THE HOUSES OF RESIDENCE AT ST WODE'S COLLEGE REPLIED LESLIE
I WILL TELL YOU BY AND BY BELLE PUT ON HER DRESSING-GOWN AND RAN ACROSS THE LANDING TO ANNIE'S DOOR
HE SMILED DROPPED ON HIS KNEES MUTTERED A HASTY PRAYER AND TUMBLING INTO BED WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP
YOU MUST TRY TO SUBDUE YOUR EMOTION
E-TEXT PREPARED BY ROGER FRANK AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET NOTE
IF IT IS BEST FOR HER TO GO TO GOD HE WILL NOT LEAVE HER IN THE WORLD JUST BECAUSE YOU SELFISHLY WISH IT
IT IS MY DUTY TO SAVE HER FROM GETTING INTO HOPELESS DISGRACE I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE SAID LESLIE
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND

SHE IS VERY POOR NEARLY STARVING
AS YOU ARE ACQUIRING LEARNING AND AS THOSE MAGNIFICENT BRAINS OF YOURS ARE BEING CULTIVATED TO THEIR FULL WORTH YOU WILL BE PREPARING FOR A LEARNED PROFESSION OR A PROFESSORSHIP OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
I WILL TRY TO TELL YOU SOMETHING AMUSING TO-DAY KITTY
WHEN BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN THAT NIGHT SHE RETURNED TO HER OWN ROOM ANNIE HAD ALREADY GONE TO BED AND WAS FAST ASLEEP
SHE HEARD MRS ACHESON SHUT HERSELF INTO HER OWN ROOM AND BELLE SHUT HERSELF INTO HERS
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW I HAVE ENJOYED MY EVENING TO BELLE HE DID NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT HIS SPECIAL ENJOYMENT
WE ARE NOT IN THE ORDINARY GROOVE
SHE THEN WENT AND STOOD BY THE FIREPLACE
SHE COULD GUESS AND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN CAUSED HER TO TREMBLE
I KNOW IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY AND FROM THE BEST AUTHORITY REPLIED LESLIE
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE EARNEST AND CLEVER AND DON'T FLATTER
OH GOD HELP ME TO BEAR IT SHE SAID RAISING A PITEOUS CRY TO THE ONE WHO ALONE COULD HELP HER
WE HAVE NO SPECIAL VALUABLES
SHE SHALL NEVER GET INTO TROUBLE ON MY ACCOUNT IF YOU ON YOUR PART WILL KEEP YOUR WORD YOU ARE PLUCKY SAID COLCHESTER
I SHALL MAKE HER GIVE ME SOME OF HER MONEY TO GET THE NEEDFUL THINGS WITH
COME DON'T YOU THINK YOU HAVE HAD QUITE AS MUCH FRIVOLOUS CONVERSATION AS IS GOOD FOR YOU
HOW I AM TO GET THAT TWENTY POUNDS HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS
HOW MYSTERIOUS YOU ARE LET US PRAY FOR HER MARJORIE
RUPERT PROMISED TO GO AWAY
LETTIE HAS GIVEN UP HER COLLEGIATE TRAINING HAS ENTERED SOCIETY MAKING MRS CHETWYND VERY HAPPY BY SO DOING AND IS MUCH LIKED FOR HER CHEERFUL AND TAKING MANNERS AND HER PRETTY FACE
SHE HELD THE BABY TENDERLY
DO COME BOTH OF YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LIGHT SEATED IN A BOAT WAS A GIRL
I NEVER KNEW ANYONE SO CHANGED
HEAR BURST FROM SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHOSE IDEAS COINCIDED WITH BELLE'S
I CAN HAVE LESSONS IN THE CLASSICS IF I HAVE TIME ENOUGH PRESENTLY
YOU DID NOT BETRAY ME TO-DAY AND YOU WON'T BETRAY ME NOW
THAT'S CHEERING SAID LESLIE
POOR GIRL I WISH SHE WOULD CONFIDE IN ME
AFTER A VERY FEW MOMENTS MARJORIE ROSE TO HER FEET
TO DO SO THEY MUST HAVE PASSED OR WILL HAVE TO PASS CERTAIN EXAMINATIONS
BUT I CANNOT--CANNOT BE FRIENDS WITH HER RUPERT HAS GONE RUPERT HAS GONE MOANED ANNIE AND MY SUN HAS SET LESLIE HEARD THE WORDS BUT EVEN THEY DID NOT SOFTEN HER
HE SPOKE TO ME
YOU KNOW SHE IS MY TWIN
ONE OF HIS CLERKS CAME TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH THEM
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST OBJECTION IF YOU WILL COME WITH US
DIRECT TEMPTATION WOULD SHRINK AWAY FROM ONE SO PURE SO INNOCENT SO GENEROUS SO LOVING
BUT WHAT WERE YOU MADE OF
I WILL SPEAK OUT
LLEWELLYN PUT ONE OF HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND DREW HER CLOSE TO HIM
YOU KNOW QUITE WELL WHO I AM REPLIED LETITIA
ALL OUR PURSUITS ALL OUR DESIRES ARE THE SAME
THE HARD AND TERRIBLE STRAIN HAS LEFT MY HEART
WE ARE--VERY PLEASE INTRODUCE ME MISS GILROY SAID JANE HERIOT TOUCHING LESLIE ON HER SLEEVE
I SHALL BE AT ST WODE'S UNTIL NEXT JUNE
SHE IS IN HER ROOM AND I HOPE ASLEEP
DO YOU WANT A UNIVERSITY LIFE TOO OH IF YOU WOULD ONLY GIVE IT TO HIM SAID LESLIE
UNLESS MISS COLCHESTER'S ILLNESS IS REALLY VERY SERIOUS AND NEEDS A DOCTOR SHE WILL BE VERY SEVERELY REPRIMANDED FOR THIS WILLFUL DISOBEDIENCE TO THE COMMAND OF HER PRINCIPAL CONTINUED MISS FRERE
HE CAME IN THAT WAY
WELL MA'AM IT HAS PLEASED THE ALMIGHTY TO TAKE MY WIFE AND CHILD AWAY FROM ME AND I AM HERE AT YOUR SERVICE AND WITH THE ORDERS OF YOUR DEAD HUSBAND TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU AND YOURS
THE NEXT INSTANT BELLE CAME UP
BE SURE YOU FOLLOW UP THE IMPRESSION I HAVE MADE WITH THE FAIR BELLE THEN HE MADE A GRIMACE KISSED ANNIE LIGHTLY ON HER FOREHEAD AND LEFT THE HOUSE
THE FACES OF ALL THE YOUNG GILROYS WERE BRIGHT ALL THE PAIRS OF EYES WERE FRANK AND HAPPY
DON'T YOU KNOW MRS CHETWYND THAT TEA IS DECIDEDLY BAD FOR THE BRAIN AND ALSO FOR THE COATS OF THE STOMACH
IT IS FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND POETRY AND CONSCIOUS STRENGTH
COME TO MY ROOM TO-MORROW
TA-TA HE REPLIED
YOU KNOW THAT UNPLEASANT MATTER HAS BEEN ARRANGED
YES MOTHER IN A SOMEWHAT SOLEMN STYLE
YOUR NEAT LITTLE HEAD SUNNING OVER WITH CURLS REQUIRES PLENTY OF ARRANGEMENT
YOU HAVE A ROOM AND IT IS NOT ORNAMENTAL
COME IF YOU WISH
I HAVE RUINED MYSELF ABSOLUTELY AND FOR EVER
THOSE GREAT TRUTHS WHICH OUGHT TO AGITATE THE SOULS OF EACH MAN AND WOMAN WORTHY OF THE NAME HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY BORNE IN UPON ME DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS
THE ROOMS WERE PAPERED WITH A SELF-COLORED PAPER OF PALE BLUE
WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN--THAT IS AUNT HELEN IS
MAY I ASK IF YOU AND MY DAUGHTER ARE GREAT FRIENDS NO REPLIED ANNIE
ALTHOUGH IN SOME WAYS MY VIEWS HAVE CHANGED DON'T TELL ME SO
BUT FOR GILROY'S SAKE I--I'LL NEVER REFUSE YOU CHILD
SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT LESLIE
SHE FELT THAT NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HER TO DESERT HER OLD FRIEND
LESLIE WENT AND SAT WITH HER BACK TO HER
YOU DID NOT VISIT ME SO I THOUGHT BELLE MIGHT BE ENGROSSING YOUR SOCIETY
WHILE RUPERT HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE SHE HAD FOLLOWED ALL HIS MOVEMENTS WITH A TERRIBLE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM AND HIS WAYS WHICH GAVE HER THE CLEW TO MUCH THAT HE WAS DOING
THEN IN HER STOCKINGED FEET SHE CROSSED THE ROOM AND TOOK HER PLACE IN SHADOW CLOSE TO THE WINDOW WHERE RUPERT HAD STOOD THAT EVENING
I HAVE NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER
HER NAME IS BELLE ACHESON A QUEER CONVULSED SORT OF LOOK PASSED OVER JANE'S FACE FOR A QUARTER OF A SECOND THEN VANISHED
YOU HAVE GOT A CHANCE ONE CHANCE
AND THERE WAS NOTHING SO DISTASTEFUL AS ECCENTRICITY
SHOULD SHE GO AND CONFIDE HER FEARS TO MISS FRERE
I HAVE RECOMMENDED THEM TO JOIN ME AT ST WODE'S COLLEGE WINGFIELD IMMEDIATELY
I'LL SOUND HIM WHATEVER HAPPENS WHEN MR PARKER GOT TO THE GILROYS HOUSE IT SO HAPPENED THAT LLEWELLYN HIMSELF WAS GOING UP THE STEPS
MY MOTHER HAS ALWAYS TAUGHT ME TO PAY A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION TO PERSONAL APPEARANCE BELLE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH AND BECAME INSTANTLY SILENT
AND I SHOULD NOT BE HERE AT THIS MOMENT WERE IT NOT FOR THE GREAT KINDNESS OF A FRIEND OF MY DEAR FATHER'S A MR PARKER PARKER SAID ANNIE STARTING
DO GO AND LEAVE ME
IT IS A GREAT BOON TO ME
BUT YOU KNOW SHE ALWAYS DID WHAT I DID
IT IS SUPPOSED TO HIDE THE WASHHAND-STAND
GOOD-BY THE LAURELS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SWEET TO GATHER
EVEN LLEWELLYN DROPPED HIS DESPONDENT AIR AND STOOD UP BIG AND MANLY FIVE FEET TEN ON THE HEARTHRUG
FOR THE DESPERATE ONLY DESPERATE DEVICES
I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CONDUCT FOR HER PROBITY AND HONESTY
I BITTERLY REPENT OF THE SIN WHICH I COMMITTED
EVEN BELLE WITH ALL HER ECCENTRICITIES HAD A PERCEPTIBLE INFLUENCE UPON ANNIE NOW
I NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE SAID LESLIE
BUT YOU MUST GO TO BED NOW
ON THE VERY DAY WHEN BELLE ACHESON HAD VISITED THE CHETWYNDS IN THEIR FASHIONABLE HOUSE IN BELGRAVIA MRS GILROY COMING IN LATER THAN USUAL FOUND LLEWELLYN A HANDSOME LAD OF SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE CROUCHING OVER THE FIRE IN THE LITTLE PARLOR WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
IF SO YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO TEMPT ME IN WHAT WAY
BUT I AM TOLD THAT SOME OF THE STUDENTS WILL CALL ON ME TO-NIGHT THEY ARE TO CALL ON US TOO SAID EILEEN
DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
IF YOU DRESS HER WELL YOU MIGHT DO WONDERS WITH HER AND BELLE IN SOCIETY SAID MRS ACHESON WITH A LAUGH
DO TELL US LESLIE WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED
AND SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE YOUNGSTERS
I FOR ONE WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU MAMMY
HER VOICE TREMBLED
WELL I DO WONDER HOW EVERYTHING WILL TURN OUT SAID EILEEN
BUT YOU HAVE FINE SHOULDERS--EH AND GOOD STOUT LEGS
HAD NOT I BETTER GET READY CHAPTER VI BELLE THE SAGE
BUT IF EVER I SHOULD HAVE A WIFE AND CHILDREN AND I MYSELF SHOULD BE BENEATH THE SOD YOU WILL LOOK AFTER THEM FOR ME PARKER
DID YOU PASS YOUR SWIMMING TEST WELL I PASSED IT LAST WEEK AND WAS CROWNED WITH HONORS SAID LESLIE WITH A MERRY SMILE
YOU AND THE MAMMA CAN WALK BEHIND THE FASCINATING BELLE AND I IN FRONT
YOU KNOW HOW SHORT OUR LIVES ARE
YES AUNT HELEN
OH DO COME IN LESLIE SHE CRIED
WELL WELL SO FAR SO GOOD
ALL HER USUAL GOOD SPIRITS RETURNED WHEN SHE WAS OUT IN THE OPEN AIR
YOU HAVE COME HERE OF YOUR OWN WILL AND GO YOU SHAN'T I WILL STAY WITH YOU IF IT WILL REALLY COMFORT YOU SAID LESLIE
IF I PASS WITH HONORS IN MY JUNE EXAM I SHALL GET A GOOD SITUATION AND WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT YOUR PASSING YOUR EXAM OR NOT ANNIE
THE MONEY WAS TO BE GIVEN IN NOTES AND GOLD
SHE HAD BEEN THERE NOW FOR THREE TERMS AND HAD ALREADY MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION ON HER TUTORS
THERE I MUST NOT SIT STILL ANY LONGER
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
I DO FORBID YOU EILEEN
I CANNOT STAND THIS OH I FEEL SOMEHOW IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT
THERE IS NO SAYING
BELLE WORE HER BEST DRESS
SHE DID NOT HEAR IT
WHY SHOULD NOT A BONA-FIDE BROTHER GO TO SEE HIS ONLY SISTER
YOU ARE JUST THE SAME DEAR ODD DELIGHTFUL GIRL YOU ALWAYS WERE WHETHER I AM DELIGHTFUL OR NOT IT IS VERY RUDE OF YOU TO INTERRUPT ME SAID BELLE FROWNING
WHY DO YOU HIDE YOUR REAL THOUGHTS FROM ME LEW
YOU WANT TO HELP MOTHER
BY AND BY YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT IT IS THE HEIGHT OF NONSENSE NOT TO LIVE IN COMFORT WHEN YOU CAN
A TRACTION DEAL IN A WESTERN CITY IS THE PIVOT ABOUT WHICH THE ACTION OF THIS CLEVER STORY REVOLVES
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS MY DUTY TO TELL YOU BOTH PLAINLY WHAT I THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT BUT THAT IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE YOU SEE WE AGREE WITH YOU SAID MARJORIE
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF LETTERS ON HER PLATE
THERE ARE TWO RESIDENT TUTORS IN EACH HOUSE AND ALSO A VICE-PRINCIPAL
THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE A CAB WITH ME COMING FROM THE STATION AND SEEM TO BE VERY NICE GIRLS INDEED I LIKE THEIR FACES SAID MISS HERIOT
SHE THEREFORE BENT HER HEAD IN TOKEN OF WILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE BELLE ACHESON FOR A FEW HOURS INTO HER HOUSE
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH--IF THERE IS--ANY HOPE ARE YOU THE SISTER OF THE YOUNG LADY ASKED THE MEDICAL MAN
THERE WAS A TREMBLE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
OH I WAS RESTING TO-DAY I WAS SO TIRED
AND MAY I ASK WHAT THIS SCREEN IS FOR OH
HER FACE IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
DO NOT INTERRUPT ME WITH THAT SENSELESS REMARK
NOT A BIT OF IT BELLE
COFFEE STRONG BLACK COFFEE ONE IS OBLIGED TO TAKE NOW AND THEN PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE HAS TO SIT UP AT NIGHT BEFORE AN EXAM
L
IT IS SAFE--HE HAS NOT TAKEN IT
I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU SAID LESLIE
THE OPENER'S SPEECH LASTED ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES
IT SO HAPPENS THAT I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU AND SHOULD HAVE CALLED UPON YOU IF YOU HAD NOT COME TO ME
HOW TERRIBLE YOU LOOK
THE CRUDEST THE MOST TERRIBLE USE
THERE I OUGHT NOT TO CONFIDE IN A NEW GIRL AND ON THE FIRST NIGHT TELL ME ANYTHING THAT WILL COMFORT YOU SAID LESLIE IN A VOICE FULL OF SYMPATHY
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU MR PARKER SHE SAID HOLDING OUT HER HAND TO HIM
BUT THE BROTHER
BELLE SUPPOSE YOU GO FOR A DRIVE WITH ANNIE
MARJORIE AND EILEEN LOOKED NO LONGER DISPLEASED
WE HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR QUITE A LONG TIME--NEARLY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS SHE KISSED HER COUSIN AS SHE SPOKE
HOW QUEER AND DREAMLIKE AND WONDERFUL ALL THIS IS SHE SAID TO HERSELF
BUT THEY HAVE GOT FINE CHARACTERS AND WOULD NOT WILLINGLY PAIN YOU
YES I AM TIRED ANSWERED LESLIE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ONLY TO-DAY NO ANNIE
MRS CHETWYND THREW UP HER HANDS AND SLIGHTLY RAISED HER ARCHED BROWS
GO THOMAS AND DESIRE ESTHER TO COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY.--SHE WILL MEND YOUR BRAID MY DEAR EILEEN
A WASHHAND-STAND IS OF COURSE ESSENTIAL AND THERE IS A CHEST OF DRAWERS WHERE I KEEP MY THINGS BY THE WAY HOW MANY DRESSES HAVE YOU BELLE SAID EILEEN SUDDENLY
I'LL JUST ENTER YOUR NAME IN MY BOOK
IF SO PRAY SIT DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME AND DON'T EXPECT TO STIR FOR A WEEK
THERE WAS EMOTION IN HIS TONE
BUT THE THING IS THIS
IF WE WERE SELFISH SHE WAS NOT TO BLAME
BUT I HOPE TO GOODNESS YOU ARE NOT
I HAVE GOT MORE MONEY THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AND I CHOOSE MY GIRLS TO LOOK NICE
YOU OUGHT TO LIE DOWN AND SEE A DOCTOR
AND PRESENTLY THE FOOTMAN APPEARED AND TOLD THE GIRLS THAT DINNER WAS READY
THE ROOMS CERTAINLY POSSESS THE NECESSARY COMFORTS OF CIVILIZED LIFE PURSUED EILEEN AND FOR MY PART I CANNOT SAY THAT I AM SORRY
HE WAS SO GOOD-LOOKING THAT POOR FOOLISH ANNIE FELT A GLOW AT HER HEART WHEN SHE SAW HIM ENTER THE ROOM
YOUR BROTHER ALSO ASSURED ME THAT HE COULD DO MY WORK WELL
I WILL THEN MORE FULLY DECLARE MY PLANS AND SHOW THE GIRLS WHO WISH TO JOIN OUR LEAGUE A PROGRAMME WHICH I HOPE THEY WILL APPROVE OF MISS LAUDERDALE SAID A GREAT DEAL MORE
I SHALL BEGIN DOUBLE ENTRY AND BOOKKEEPING AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING TO-MORROW AND THE CLASSICS MAY GO TO HONG KONG FOR THE PRESENT
AS TO WHAT MR PARKER SAID YOU KNOW ANNIE THAT IT REMAINS WITH YOURSELF AND DO YOU THINK SAID ANNIE COLORING AND SHIVERING THAT IF I COULD BRING MYSELF TO TELL THE REAL TRUTH I SHOULD GET THE POST I THINK SO
BUT I--IT DOES NOT MATTER
STRANGE AS IT ALL IS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I AM CERTAIN I SHALL FIND IT DELIGHTFUL BY AND BY
IT COMMENCES THUS WE HAD BETTER STOP ROWING SAID EILEEN
BUT YOU MISS GILROY HAVE A WELL-DEVELOPED SOUL
EILEEN HAD TURNED AWAY AND WAS ENGROSSED IN A BOOK ON COOKERY WHICH SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM A SIDE-TABLE
SHE LAUGHED A GOOD DEAL DESCRIBED SOME OF HER ADVENTURES IN TOWN IN A SPIRITED MANNER AND WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS
LESLIE IS AS OPEN AS THE DAY AND THERE IS NOTHING IN HER LETTERS THAT YOU MAY NOT SEE AS OPEN AS THE DAY--EH
THAT SHE WAS STANDING BY HER DESK TURNING OVER HER LESLIE'S PAPERS JUST AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
WE DINE AT HALF-PAST SEVEN SHE LEFT THE ROOM AS SHE SPOKE AND ESTHER A NICE-LOOKING GIRL CAME RESPECTFULLY FORWARD
IN EVERY HOUSE OF RESIDENCE IN EVERY COLLEGE THERE ARE DRONES POOR USELESS CREATURES WHO FOLLOW THE BUSY BEES
YOU ARE PRETTY ENOUGH TO LOOK CHARMING IN THE SIMPLEST DRESS
I AM WRITING A PAPER ON THAT GREAT MAN AND I WISH TO READ IT TO THE GIRLS IN ORDER TO GET THEIR OPINION THEY KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT THE CLASSICS INTERRUPTED MRS CHETWYND
ONE BY ONE THE INHABITANTS SLEPT ALL BUT ANNIE WHO LAY WITH EVERY NERVE TINGLING AND HER SENSE OF WAITING PRETERNATURALLY ACUTE
MRS CHETWYND REMEMBERED THESE TRAITS IN HER TWO BRIGHT GIRLS AS SHE WELCOMED THEM TO THEIR HOME
NOW WAS HER TIME FOR ACTION
POOR ANNIE COLCHESTER--HAS SHE A CHANCE TO SLEEP WITH THAT TERRIBLE MENTAL EXCITEMENT
SHE WAS STANDING BY HER SMALL ATTIC WINDOW WITH HER BACK TO THE VIEW
YOU HAVE ASTONISHED AND PAINED ME HE SAID AT LAST
IT IS TRUE HE WAS KIND TO ME FOR HE HELPED TO PAY FOR MY EDUCATION AT ST WODE'S
WELL COME WITH ME NOW
BUT COME NOW
DO YOU KNOW EILEEN I HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO THAT PRETTY MISS GILROY SO HAVE I ANSWERED MARJORIE
YOU ARE ALWAYS SOMEWHAT SALLOW BUT YOU LOOK WELL
POOR EILEEN ILL
ALL THE MODERN TRAINING TENDS TO IT MAMMY AND YOU CANNOT KEEP US BACK
SO I SHALL HAVE MY CHANCE LESLIE--A SMALL PARTNERSHIP BY AND BY
SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE ST WODE'S
AND YOU CAN GO YOURS
LESLIE FELT SHE COULD NOT BETRAY HER
TUT TUT
IS IT NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO WITH LESS THAN SIXTY POUNDS NO NOT A PENNY LESS CAME THE QUICK REPLY
I TOOK THIS HOUSE FOR THE PURPOSE
YOU SEE I HAVE SPENT ALL MY LIFE IN LONDON AND HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE OF LEARNING OH IF YOU ARE A LONDON GIRL YOU OUGHT TO HAVE COURAGE FOR ANYTHING
DURING THAT TIME I HOPE TO SAVE BY THE STRICTEST ECONOMY QUITE FIFTY POUNDS MORE
NOW RUPERT SHE SAID COMING BACK TO HIM THE WINDOW IS OPEN AND YOU CAN GO
HE STILL DID SO AND KEPT ON TALKING TO LLEWELLYN AND THE YOUNGER CHILDREN
SHE RANG THE BELL
I FOUND I COULD NOT STUDY
MRS CHETWYND DID NOT COME DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
I SHALL SEE YOU ALONE
I OFTEN DOUBT IF SHE NOTICES WHAT GOES ON AROUND HER WELL THEN YOU HAD BETTER REMIND HER
YOU MUST HELP ME PUT THE BOAT BACK INTO THE HOUSE SHE SAID
ANNIE I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONFESS TO YOU
TEN AND FOUR MAKE FOURTEEN
IN A FEW MINUTES SHE RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY LESLIE
I THINK IT WELL TO TELL YOU
IF ANNIE WAS NICE HER BROTHER WAS EVEN NICER
I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT SUM THAT I HAVE SAVED BUT IT IS NOT VERY FAR FROM A HUNDRED POUNDS
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD SUFFER A GOOD DEAL WHEN THEY EXPLAINED THEMSELVES BUT WHEN DID IT BEGIN WELL TWO OR THREE GIRLS--AMERICANS I THINK--JOINED THE SCHOOL LAST TERM AND MARJORIE AND EILEEN BECAME GREAT FRIENDS WITH THEM
IT SO HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A VACANCY FOR TWO SISTERS AT WEST HALL AND OWING TO THE BREAKING-DOWN OF A HIGHLY NERVOUS STUDENT WHO HAD WORKED TOO HARD FOR CLASSICAL HONORS THERE WAS ALSO A VACANCY IN THE NORTH HALL
OH IF YOU WOULD ONLY DO IT HER WHOLE FACE LIT UP HER EYES SHONE AND SHE LAID HER HAND ON MR PARKER'S ARM
IT IS SO HEAVY I MADE NO REPLY
CERTAINLY DEAR MOTHER I INTEND TO
THERE'S A SLAP IN THE FACE SHE SAID
HE ASKED ME ALL ABOUT OUR MEANS
I SUPPOSE SO
CUSTOM MY DEAR--CUSTOM
I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SAID LETTIE GOOD-HUMOREDLY I'M NOT HALF SUCH A BAD SOUL AS YOU MAKE ME OUT
SHE HAS COMMITTED A VERY GRAVE ACT OF DISOBEDIENCE
I COULD KEEP A NICHE FOR YOU IF YOU SIGNIFIED YOUR WISH AT AN EARLY DATE THANK YOU ANSWERED LESLIE RISING AS SHE SPOKE BUT I COULD NOT ACCEPT IT
FOR ALL THESE GOOD THESE DEAR PEOPLE LOOK UPON CRIME AS AN IMPOSSIBILITY THOUGHT THE GIRL
BUT I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE INGENIOUS WAY IN WHICH THE WINDOWS WERE FASTENED AND THEN HE SEEMED TO THINK WE WERE ABSOLUTELY SAFE
HER BRIGHT WAVY HAIR WAS ARRANGED IN THE LATEST AND MOST FASHIONABLE MANNER
WE CAN THEN START OUR HOSTEL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BUT WHAT ABOUT FOOD AND FURNITURE AND ALL THE REST OF THE THINGS WELL EACH GIRL OF COURSE MUST BRING HER OWN SHARE
I WILL DO MY BEST MY VERY BEST THE MAN WALKED AWAY AND ANNIE STANDING FOR A MOMENT WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER WITH HER HANDS HANGING HELPLESSLY TO HER SIDES TURNED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COLLEGE
BUT I DARE SAY I SHALL GET ON WITH HER VERY WELL AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN PART OF THE ROOM AS PRETTY AS YOU PLEASE SAID FLORRIE SPEAKING AGAIN
I FEEL QUITE OVERCOME SAID LESLIE TO HER MOTHER
I AM ON THE WHOLE HEARTILY PLEASED HIS REPLY CAME SLOWLY AND AS THOUGH HE HAD WEIGHED EACH WORD
HE FELL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS RUBBING
AS SHE DID SO A NURSE CAME OUT OF THE SICK-ROOM
THEREFORE I HAVE LET MY MUSIC DROP DEAR DEAR
MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE LANDING
BUT AS A RULE I DO NOT SEE PEOPLE ON PRIVATE BUSINESS IN MY OFFICE I HAVE COME TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT LESLIE GILROY SAID ANNIE
AND WHAT IS MORE I MUST HAVE IT
HOW HAVE YOU FURNISHED YOUR ROOM MY HALF-ROOM--I ONLY POSSESS HALF A ROOM--WAS FURNISHED FOR ME BY THE GOVERNORS OF THE COLLEGE SAID LESLIE
BUT NO ONE ELSE SAID LESLIE
I NEVER TAKE TEA THANK YOU
POOR GIRL SHE SPOKE OF IT AS COLD WATER TO THE THIRSTY
SHE HAD NOT DARED TO DO THIS TO HER OWN GIRLS FEARING TO AWAKEN THEM
BLESS ME IF I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS EVEN NOW HE SAID ANXIOUSLY TO HIMSELF
IT WAS WHEN HE WAS LOOKING AT BELLE'S PRECIOUS GREEK TESTAMENT WHICH LAY ON TOP OF IT
HE LOOKED AT HIS MOTHER AS IF ABOUT TO SPEAK AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF
WHETHER I SUCCEED OR NOT REMAINS TO BE PROVED YOUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON YOURSELF--THE SINGLE EYE REMEMBER THE UNTARNISHED SOUL BELLE'S WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER FROM LETTIE
OH I FORGOT ALL ABOUT YOU
THEY HAVE JUST COME TO ST WODE'S--THEIR NAMES ARE MARJORIE AND EILEEN CHETWYND
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT I HAD TAKEN THAT LETTER AND ALSO THE WRITING LESLIE GILROY LEFT HERE THE OTHER DAY TO ESSEX THE EXPERT
AND THEN I DON'T EVER MEAN TO BE ORNAMENTAL
IT WASTES TIME AND OH TIME IS SO PRECIOUS
IT IS THROUGH HER I GOT IT
I WISH I COULD YOU CAN IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I ASK
I WON'T EVER DO ANYTHING WRONG TO HELP YOU AGAIN OH YOU WON'T WON'T YOU
I GAVE IT TO HER OF COURSE FOR YOUR LETTER WAS SO PITIABLE
AFTER MR PARKER'S ONE HAND-CLASP WHICH WAS FIRM AND CORDIAL ENOUGH HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK ON HER
YOU WROTE TO MOTHER ABOUT THEM AND ABOUT THAT EXTRAORDINARY GIRL BELLE ACHESON
I HEARD HIM SAY SO
LESLIE LESLIE THE DOCTORS ARE COMING DOWNSTAIRS
HER BOOKS PAPERS AND PROBLEMS WERE PUSHED ASIDE
IT'S AWFUL TO HEAR YOU SPEAK BUT IT'S TRUE MOTHER
AND NO ONE EVER LED A MORE UPRIGHT EXEMPLARY SPLENDID LIFE SAID THE WIDOW
IT SANK TO A HUSKY WHISPER
SO IT'S JUST AS WELL THAT I SHOULD BE THE ONE WE MEAN TO HAVE NO FAILURES IN THIS FAMILY SAID MRS GILROY
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL SHE CONTINUED AND YET IN SOME WAYS I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU LOOK BETTER I HAVE A HEADACHE BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST REPLIED ANNIE
LET ME TELL YOU YOU WILL BE IN LUCK IF YOU GET INTO THAT ROOM AT ALL TO-NIGHT FOR ONE OF HER UNPLEASANT HABITS IS TO LOCK THE DOOR THEN SHE GOES TO BED WITHOUT THINKING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT
EVEN IN THIS HOUSE OF LEARNING FRIVOLITY CREEPS IN LESLIE SMILED AND ENDEAVORED TO DRAW HER COMPANION INTO MORE REASONABLE CONVERSATION
THE STEPS APPROACHED THE WINDOW
WE WILL DISCUSS THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE AND THE BEAUTY OF THOSE FAIR COMPANIONS OF YOURS LATER ON HE REMARKED
DEAR MARJORIE HOW SHE WILL FEEL IT
THINK WHAT SHE SUFFERED
THE KNOCKER TO THE DOOR WAS MUFFLED
YOU SURELY DO NOT MEAN TO REFUSE YOUR STARVING BROTHER OF COURSE I CANNOT REFUSE YOU SAID ANNIE
RUPERT I WILL NOT DO WRONG FOR YOU
THE BOX WHICH HELD HER FEW POSSESSIONS HAD ARRIVED
BUT WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY CONTINUED MISS COLCHESTER IS THIS
I MANAGED THE THING SOMEHOW AND HERE I AM
BUT I DO NOT KNOW THE STORY TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE WELL YOU CAN HELP ME ANYHOW
SHE HAD CONSIDERABLE INTELLECTUAL POWER AND BETWEEN THEM THE GIRLS WORKED OUT THE PROBLEM WITH REGARD TO HIPPOCLEIDES
THE SECRETARYSHIP WOULD HAVE SAVED HER--IT WOULD HAVE ENABLED HER TO LIVE RESPECTABLY AND IN COMFORT
WHY DID SHE WRITE TO ME AS SHE DID
SHE WAS ONLY CONSCIOUS THAT MR PARKER HAD PULLED OUT HIS WATCH UTTERED A HASTY EXCLAMATION LOOKED TO RIGHT AND LEFT THEN GOING UP TO HER STOOPED AND KISSED HER LIGHTLY ON HER FOREHEAD
ANNIE MY DEAR I WANT YOUR HELP AGAIN
YOU DEAR MAMMY MUST BE GUIDED BY US FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR DAYS
I LOVE HER NOTWITHSTANDING HER SIN
AND WHY MAY I ASK
HE GAVE ME A HOLIDAY AT ONCE WHEN I ASKED HIM THIS MORNING
WHAT SHALL I DO CRIED MARJORIE
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO YOU JUST AT PRESENT MOTHER
AN OLD WOMAN LIKE MOTHER TAKEN OUT DAY AND NIGHT AT ALL HOURS JUST TO GIVE YOU A JOLLY TIME BUT REALLY MY DEARS I AM NOT AN OLD WOMAN SAID MRS CHETWYND INDIGNANTLY
THEN YOU ARE IN TROUBLE DEAR OLD GIRL TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES
AND WHEN THEY RETIRED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM MRS CHETWYND SUGGESTED A LITTLE MUSIC
DON'T WASTE TIME TALKING MAY I SAID LESLIE LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT MRS CHETWYND
WHAT AM I TO DO SHE SAID NOW TO HERSELF
HOW I WISH YOUR DEAR FATHER AND MY DEAR HUSBAND WERE ALIVE TO HEAR YOU FATHER COULD ALWAYS SEE THROUGH HUMBUGS SAID EILEEN TO MARJORIE
AND IF I DO FORGET TO PUT MY BOOTS OUTSIDE AT NIGHT YOU MAY GATHER THEM UP WITH YOUR OWN AND FLING THEM ON THE LANDING
IS MARJORIE'S ROOM JUST THE SAME PRECISELY
ARE NOT YOU GOING TO GET OUT YOUR BOOKS
MR CHARLES PARKER SHE UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT
I WILL PET YOU AND YOU WILL SOON FORGET ALL YOUR WORRIES
DO YOU WANT TO GO SHE SAID
BUT I MUST OWN THAT I RESPECT MR COLCHESTER AND ENJOY TALKING TO HIM
THERE IS ROMANCE OF LOVE MYSTERY PLOT AND FIGHTING AND A BREATHLESS DASH AND GO ABOUT THE TELLING WHICH MAKES ONE QUITE FORGET ABOUT THE IMPROBABILITIES OF THE STORY
GO UP TO ONE OF THE CLERKS AND SAY THAT YOU WISH TO SEE MR PARKER AGAIN LESLIE FOUND HERSELF HESITATING BUT THEN SHE QUICKLY MADE UP HER MIND
I AM SURE MY DEAR BELLE BUT MRS CHETWYND DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT DEAR BELLE
WE OUGHT TO BE READY TO START FOR EAST HALL AT 8.25 SAID LESLIE AS SHE CAME IN
BLESS MY SOUL
BLESS MY SOUL
BESIDES THE WINDOWS ARE ALL THOROUGHLY SECURED SHE SHOWED THE DEVICE OF THE LATCH TO RUPERT WHO SAID IT WAS CLEVER VERY INGENIOUS INDEED
LETTIE IS MY OWN COUSIN
THAT IS MY NEWS
YES EILEEN IS VERY ILL VERY ILL INDEED
I HAVE ONLY TWO
BUT WHO IN THE WORLD IS LLEWELLYN MY BROTHER AND THE DARLING OF MY HEART YOUR BROTHER THE DARLING OF YOUR HEART ECHOED ANNIE
COME RIGHT IN LESLIE HE SAID
THEN I AM AFRAID SAID EILEEN
HER HAIR WAS PARTED SMOOTHLY ON HER FOREHEAD AND DONE UP IN A TINY KNOT OR DAB AT THE BACK OF HER NECK
SHE WENT TO IT FOUND IT STILL ON THE LATCH OPENED IT AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUND HERSELF IN THE QUADRANGLE
I HAD BETTER LET KITTY AND MABEL KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN HE SAID
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID ANNIE
IT IS CRACKED RIGHT ACROSS
NO TIME AT ALL I ASSURE YOU
IT WAS IN NO WAY HER FAULT IF THE GIRLS TOOK AFTER THEIR FATHER WHO HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A BRAVE SOLDIER BUT ALSO THAT STRANGE COMBINATION A SCHOLAR AS WELL AND WHO HAD DIED BEFORE THE GIRLS EDUCATION WAS COMPLETE
AND MOTHER WILL BE FULL OF SYMPATHY
BUT I THOUGHT THAT YOUR TEACHER MISS FOX SPOKE HIGHLY OF YOUR MUSICAL TALENTS SHE SAID I SHOULD PLAY WELL IF I PRACTICED HARD
HAVE YOU A TIDY MOTHER
YOU MUST PUT THAT BOX BACK RUPERT SAID ANNIE
IT WOULD HURT HER TOO TERRIBLY IF HE WERE PUNISHED
EILEEN BEGAN TO BE POORLY AND NOT HERSELF A WEEK AGO
YES I WILL SEE HER
MRS CHETWYND HAD A CAREFULLY TRAINED EAR AND SHE QUITE SHUDDERED WHEN MARJORIE CRASHED OUT SOME OF HER TERRIBLE DISCORDS
HOW IS SHE BEARING UP
THIS IS A VERY NICE HOUSE HE SAID
I SAY CRIED KITTY ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE OLD LESLIE BACK AGAIN
I DID THINK THAT YOU WERE ABOVE ALL THE PETTY WANTS AND CAPRICES OF YOUR SEX
I HAVE HAD SUCH A CROSS DAY CROSS--WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID KITTY
THE AUTHOR OF THE HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CANDLES HAS HERE GIVEN US A BUOYANT ROMANCE BRIMMING WITH LIVELY HUMOR AND OPTIMISM
I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING ASKING ME TO MEET HIM IN REGENT'S PARK DEAR DEAR SAID MRS ACHESON
EXPECT ME ON SATURDAY AND I WILL BRING BELLE IF I CAN MRS CHETWYND HEAVED A SIGH AS HER FRIEND LEFT THE ROOM
THEY BOTH SAT BACK IN THEIR SEATS AND INDULGED IN HEARTY GIRLISH LAUGHTER
NO SAID MR PARKER
YES I MUST PRESENT THEM BOTH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
A MAN WAS WITH HER
FOR THERE WAS A STUBBORN BUILD ABOUT MARJORIE'S CHIN AND ABOUT THE SLIGHT VERY SLIGHT FROWN WHICH NOW AND THEN VISITED EILEEN'S INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD
ANNIE COLCHESTER HAD LONG SINCE DEPARTED
WELL COME OVER AND TAKE A PEEP AT THEM ON SATURDAY SAID MRS CHETWYND
YOU CANNOT MEAN THIS ANNIE YES I DO MEAN IT
BUT MY HEART IS BROKEN
SAID THAT SHE HAD FOUND ANNIE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WITH THE DOOR LOCKED AND BELLE'S WOODEN BOX OF COINS AT THE OTHER SIDE
SOME GOOD PHOTOGRAVURES OF PICTURES BY BURNE-JONES AND WATTS HUNG UPON THE WALLS THE CURTAINS WERE OF LIBERTY SILK THE FLOOR WAS COVERED WITH A SELF-COLORED DRUGGET THE BED WAS TURNED INTO A TASTEFULLY ARRANGED SOFA AND THE CHEST OF DRAWERS WAS RENDERED UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BY A PIANO CLOTH CONCEALING ITS BACK
BUT THE MOTHER HAD TO WORK VERY HARD
AND I KNOW WHAT ILLNESS MEANS CONTINUED LESLIE VERY SOFTLY FOR LLEWELLYN--I BEG YOUR PARDON I MEAN MY DEAR BROTHER--HE WAS TERRIBLY ILL ONCE ALMOST AT DEATH'S DOOR
SHE WAS MORE HURT THAN SHE CARED TO OWN
YOU'LL DO YOUNG SIR--YOU'LL DO CHAPTER X LLEWELLYN'S GIFT
SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE IS SAYING
AND WHAT YOUNG LADY IS THIS SAID DR HOWARD PAUSING FOR A MOMENT AND LOOKING AT HER
OH BY THE WAY
BUT TO DO THAT TO COMMIT A FORGERY AND TO DRAG ANOTHER GIRL IN IT WAS DONE FOR YOU AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE OUGHT NOT TO BLAME HER SAID LESLIE
YOUR SISTER IS IN DANGER--A BAD CASE OF TYPHOID FEVER ALWAYS MEANS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY FROM ONE SISTER TO THE OTHER
WHAT DOES SHE WANT MAY I ASK SHE WISHES ME VERY MUCH INDEED TO STAY WITH HER
BUT A WHOLE FAMILY WERE DOWN WITH IT IN A BLOCK AND EILEEN WOULD GO TO THE HOUSE AND SHE WAS VERY HOT AND THIRSTY AND THEY GAVE HER SOME WATER TO DRINK AND NOW IT SEEMS THAT ALL THAT WATER WAS TERRIBLY CONTAMINATED
I THOUGHT YOU ONE ONCE AND SO DID RUPERT
NEVERTHELESS SHE GOT INTO BED IN REASONABLE TIME AND LESLIE SAW THAT HER FEET WERE NO LONGER COLD NOR HER FOREHEAD BURNING
SHE BRIEFLY TOLD RUPERT WHAT HAD OCCURRED AT MR PARKER'S
NOT AT PRESENT MR PARKER'S VOICE CHANGED AGAIN
YES HE WAS MY BROTHER
THE NIGHT WIND CAME IN AND LIFTED A TRESS OF HER HAIR AND PLAYED WITH IT
I'LL SHOW YOU HER PICTURE SOME DAY MISS LESLIE LESLIE DID NOT REPLY
AND THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH.--MARJORIE WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE TO SAY I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL ABOUT YOUR LIFE DEAR SAID MARJORIE
WILL YOU THEREFORE MRS CHETWYND KINDLY TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SEE THAT THIS IS CARRIED OUT
LETTIE WAS SEATED BY THE WINDOW
IT WAS NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT
AND BELLE ACHESON IS TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY CONTINUED LETTIE
YOU ARE NOT RESPECTABLE AS YOU ARE
TRUSTING THAT NO ONE WOULD SEE HER SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
DO SIT DOWN THANKS SAID BELLE
I TREMBLE LEST HER CRIES AND GROANS SHOULD REACH EILEEN'S EARS
ISN'T THERE SOME EXPLANATION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MYSTERY MR PARKER LOOKED AGAIN AT THE LETTER THEN HE FOLDED IT UP AND WAS ABOUT TO PUT IT BACK INTO HIS CABINET WHEN HE SAW THE PAPER ON WHICH LESLIE HAD SCRIBBLED HER REQUEST TO HIM THAT DAY LYING ON THE FLOOR
THERE WAS A CHURCH AT THE FARTHER END OF THE SQUARE A CHURCH WHICH WAS OPEN ALL DAY TO THOSE WHO NEEDED IT
ANYONE CAN SEE MISS GILROY IS OF THE ORDERLY SORT
I WILL SPEAK TO YOU FRANKLY
THEY WERE ALSO BECOMING STRONG IN BODY
THEY SAID NOTHING MORE HOWEVER
THAT SHE SHOULD BE QUITE SO DEVOTED TO THE DEAD LANGUAGES
CAN YOU POSSIBLY COME OUT WITH ME
THE BRONZE LEFT HIS CHEEK NOW AND HIS EYES FLASHED FIRE
THIS IS AS GOOD AS A LECTURE SAID EILEEN
BUT MRS GILROY WAS NOT LISTENING
THEY JOINED THE TENNIS RACQUETS AND BOATING CLUBS
WE ARE ALL HAPPY
BUT I DETERMINED THAT WHOEVER ELSE WAS LEFT IN THE COLD I MUST INTERVIEW MARJORIE AND EILEEN
WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOU LESLIE SHE CRIED
BUT I DO NOT TAKE THEM INTO SOCIETY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GETTING HUSBANDS MRS ACHESON SLOWLY SHOOK HER HEAD
YOU REALLY OUGHT NOT TO WORK TOO HARD BUT I MUST
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT ME FOR I AM SORRY
I AM LONGING FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE ROOM
SHE LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT EILEEN
ALREADY SHE AND LESLIE WOULD BE LATE
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU I HAVE EVERY RIGHT ANNIE
ANNIE DID NOT HEAR IT
OH THERE
SHE KNEW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME WHEN SHE MUST EXERCISE SELF-CONTROL
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
AND NOW THE QUESTION IS HAS HE DONE SO
I REPEAT THE WORDS OF THE GREAT MASTERS OF LITERATURE UNDER MY BREATH WHEN SHE IS PRESENT
SHE SAID THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS GATHERING WAS TO PROPOSE THE BEGINNING OF A NEW DEPARTURE IN THEIR LIVES AND WORK
IT WAS NECESSARY TO GET MISS LAUDERDALE'S LEAVE
I ONLY WANT TO GET INTO BED AND TO SLEEP LESLIE DID NOT VENTURE TO SAY ANY MORE
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER TO SAY
MUST YOU GO OUT AGAIN TO-NIGHT MOTHER SHE ASKED
I HELPED RUPERT TOOK HIM INTO MY OWN OFFICE
ALL MY LIFE AS LONG AS I LIVE I WILL LIVE FOR YOU AND DEVOTE MYSELF TO YOU
PARTICULARLY ENGAGED JUST NOW HE CALLED OUT
AND AS MRS ACHESON INTENDS TO GO ON THE CONTINENT IN THE WINTER AND SHE WISHES ME TO--OH OF COURSE I POOH-POOHED THE IDEA
BUT THERE IS ONE POINT ON WHICH I AM RESOLVED
OH DON'T SAY ANY MORE JUST NOW AND DO MOVE AS SOFTLY AS YOU CAN
THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR IMMEDIATE ANXIETY
I HAVE A SHELF ON THE WALL WHICH CONTAINS MY BOOKS--MY FEW BOOKS TWENTY IN ALL--STANDARD WORKS MOSTLY IN THE CLASSICS
YOU NEED NOT BEGIN BY FRIGHTENING MISS GILROY
IF YOU ARE IN LONDON DURING THE SUMMER YOU MUST COME AND PAY US A VISIT WILL YOU I SHALL BE ONLY TOO DELIGHTED CRIED JANE
SHE GLANCED AT LLEWELLYN WHOSE FACE WAS NOW WHITE AS DEATH
CAN I SEE YOU BY YOURSELF YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE COME ON A VERY URGENT MATTER
I WILL GIVE YOU ONE OR TWO SIR WITH PLEASURE LLEWELLYN LEFT THE ROOM RETURNING PRESENTLY WITH A PACKET OF LETTERS KEPT TOGETHER WITH AN ELASTIC BAND
HOW CAN YOU GO IN FOR SUCH BAD WAYS
SHE FLUNG DOWN HER HANDS AND LOOKED UP AT THE DOCTOR WITH EYES FULL OF AGONY
SUPPOSE I SAY NO ANSWERED MRS CHETWYND
BUT I CAN STILL FEEL IT
LESLIE GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AS SHE WATCHED HER IN THIS PEACEFUL SLUMBER
WHEN MATTERS ARE VERY BAD I RISE AND PACE THE FLOOR
I AM SURE IT WILL DO WELL
DO YOU THINK HE--BUT THERE I CANNOT SPEAK OF HIM IN THE SAME BREATH WITH YOU
MOST SCHOLARLY GIRLS--I SEE BY THE SHAPE OF YOUR BROW THAT YOU ARE MEANT TO BE SCHOLARLY--ARE OBLIGED TO WEAR SPECTACLES WHEN I COME TO COLLEGE REPLIED MARJORIE AND I AM SUPPOSED TO BE A SCHOLARLY GIRL
MR PARKER AFTER GREETING THE OTHER CHILDREN CAME UP TO HER AND OFFERED HIS HAND
AND ON THE LONG SUMMER AFTERNOONS WE GO UP THE RIVER A GOOD DISTANCE AND VERY OFTEN DO OUR WORK UNDER THE TREES
IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT A SISTER SHOULD LIKE TO TALK TO A BROTHER
BELLE IS ALSO IN EXCELLENT HEALTH
THAT FACT HAS BEEN WELL BORNE IN UPON ME--IT IS TO BE BELLE ACHESON OR NOTHING
IT NUMBERED FROM THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS

I HAVE DONE ALL THAT A MOTHER COULD DO AND NOW JUST WHEN I WAS BEGINNING TO EXPECT MY REWARD THERE COME BACK TO ME A COUPLE OF TOMBOYS MOTHER DARLING SAID MARJORIE
THERE WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE RESTRAINED NOTE IN HIS VOICE
I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL NEVER TAKE LIFE FRIVOLOUSLY I HOPE I NEVER SHALL BELLE BELLE

NOW LISTEN

HE WAS SHOCKED
MR PARKER HAD HIMSELF VISITED ST WODE'S COLLEGE HAD SEEN THE PRINCIPAL MISS LAUDERDALE AND HAD PLEADED THE CAUSE OF LESLIE GILROY WITH SUCH PASSION AND EFFECT THAT SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE IN HER FAVOR AND SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE SAME HALL AS MARJORIE AND EILEEN
SHE AND I ARE ABHORRENT EACH TO THE OTHER
I AM IN A MIGHTY GOOD HUMOR I CAN TELL YOU AND AS HUNGRY AS A HAWK
THERE IS A GOD WHO ANSWERS PRAYERS
IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY HOT DAY I FELT A SUDDEN CHILL SAID LETTIE
30 NEWBOLT SQUARE PEOPLE OF THE NAME OF ACHESON BUT WHO ARE THEY I DON'T KNOW RUPERT THEY LIVE IN A RESPECTABLE HOUSE AND MUST BE WELL OFF SAID RUPERT
HE WENT UP TO HIS SISTER AND SHOOK HER BY THE SHOULDER
BY AND BY I MUST GET HER TO TELL ME THOUGHT LESLIE
LESLIE WAITED UNTIL SHE HAD GONE
MISS LAUDERDALE STEPPED FORWARD AND BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE STUDENTS
I AM A GIRL WHO WILL BE VERY MUCH BENEFITED BY THE PLEASANT LIFE WHICH I SEE OPENING BEFORE ME
DOUBTLESS THAT IS HIS RING
SHE RAISED HER EYES AND LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
BUT IS NOT THAT THE CARRIAGE
HELP ME NOW ANNIE AS YOU VALUE YOUR BROTHER'S FUTURE
I ACCEPTED A SITUATION TO-DAY AT LEE FORREST'S LEE FORREST'S SAID THE MOTHER
SHE HAS NOT MADE A FULL STATEMENT
HOW MUCH SPACE DO YOU REQUIRE HALF THE ROOM I SUPPOSE SAID LESLIE
FOR IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED I AM WELL JUST TO PLEASE YOU AND AS IT IS YOUR FIRST NIGHT
THAT'S ALL ROT YOU KNOW LESLIE SAID HER BROTHER ROUGHLY
SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE WALLS MAY HAVE EARS AND THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF GIRLS COMING AND GOING
NOW FOR GOODNESS SAKE LIKE A DEAR GOOD CREATURE PUT YOUR THINGS IN ORDER AND DON'T SPEAK TO ME AGAIN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU ANSWERED ANNIE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO SIR
RUPERT WANTED THE MONEY AND I WAS DISTRACTED
OH COME WITH ME IF YOU LIKE
WE WANTED YOU TO COME ON THE WATER WITH US THIS LOVELY AFTERNOON
I AM SURE WE SHALL BE FRIENDS BUT MISS FRERE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WISHING TO SEE ME AFTER DINNER SAID LESLIE
IT MUST BE THE SAME SAID ANNIE
LESLIE OH LESLIE IF YOU SAW HER NOW YOU WOULD NOT KNOW HER MARJORIE CAME UP CLOSE TO LESLIE AS SHE SPOKE

I WONDER IF IT IS QUITE CERTAIN SHE SAID PRESENTLY IF THE MR CHARLES PARKER YOU KNOW IS THE ONE IN WHOSE OFFICE MY BROTHER HAS BEEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT REPLIED LESLIE
I SUPPOSE I AM FAIRLY WELL EDUCATED
THAT IS A GOOD IDEA SAID MARJORIE
I HATE TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE
KITTY WAS BUTTERING BREAD AND MAKING SANDWICHES MABEL WAS CUTTING CAKE INTO THICK SLICES HESTER WAS DARNING A RENT IN THE BACK OF HER DRESS AND LLEWELLYN WAS HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE
I AM TOO SLEEPY TO STAY UP ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAID FASCINATING AS YOUR COCOA-PARTIES ALWAYS ARE JANIE
WHAT SPECIAL SUBJECTS DO YOU MEAN TO TAKE UP MISS CHETWYND IS MY NAME SAID EILEEN
SPARE ME DEAR EMILY SHE CRIED
THIS IS YOUR ROOM MISS EILEEN SAID MISS PAYNE
OH IF MY OWN MOTHER HAD ONLY LIVED
THE LITTLE WOODEN BOX WHICH CONTAINED THE EIGHTY-NINE POUNDS ODD WAS POINTED OUT TO RUPERT
I SHOULD NOT BE THE MISERABLE HOPELESS CREATURE I AM TO-DAY AT BREAKFAST BELLE WAS IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS
MARJORIE SAID BELLE I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAVE INTERRUPTED ME WITH THAT VERY SILLY REMARK
ARE YOU DECEIVING ME ANNIE COLCHESTER DECEIVING YOU
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT ALL THAT KIND OF THING IS HUMBUG SAID THE MAN'S VOICE
AND ANNIE'S WORDS CUT HER TO THE HEART
AS TO BEING ORNAMENTAL I HAVE NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT
THAT'S A RIGHT SPIRIT
THE PORT OF MISSING MEN
IT IS RATHER FORMIDABLE IS IT NOT BUT MISS GILROY DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY THINGS FOR YOUR ROOM A FEW THINGS I MUST HAVE SAID LESLIE BUT I RATHER DESPAIR OF MAKING A ROOM SHARED WITH MISS COLCHESTER PRETTY
BY A FLASH OF MY EYES I CAN DISCERN HOW PETTY AND SMALL ARE THE QUALITIES OF THEIR SOULS
BUT WHAT AM I TO GIVE IN ABOUT SAID MRS CHETWYND.--"LETITIA HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY
QUIET QUIET LETTIE
BUT MRS CHETWYND SAT UP LATE WISHING MUCH THAT SHE HAD MRS ACHESON TO CONSULT WITH
HE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
LESLIE COULD NOT HELP SMILING
AND GERMAN FRENCH AND ITALIAN LITERATURE HAD TO BE MORE OR LESS UNDERSTOOD IN ORDER TO GIVE HER A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE GRIP OF HER SUBJECT
AM I OUTRE SHE ALMOST GLARED INTO LESLIE'S FACE
AND PERHAPS NOW YOU WILL ALLOW ME IN MY TURN TO MAKE A REMARK
SHE REFUSES TO COME JANE STOOD STILL AND FACED LESLIE
I WON'T SEE HER GRINDING WITHOUT PUTTING MY OWN SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL
ONLY GO ANNIE STAMPED WITH HER FOOT
