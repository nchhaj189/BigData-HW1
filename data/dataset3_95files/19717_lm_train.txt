I WILL TELL YOU WHO I AM BASIL RANSOM SAID IN OBEDIENCE TO A RAPID REFLEXION
HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING IN
I REGARD IT AS THE GREAT MODERN QUESTION MISS CHANCELLOR GOT UP NOW
NOTHING COULD BE WEAKER SHE KNEW VERY WELL THAN IN THE UNITED STATES TO APPLY THAT TERM TOO LITERALLY
ADELINE GUESSED OLIVE HAD PERFECT CONTROL OF HER NOW UNLESS INDEED SHE USED THE EXPEDITIONS TO CAMBRIDGE AS A COVER FOR MEETING GENTLEMEN
THESE WERE ALSO PAINTED RED AND THE BRICKS WERE ACCENTUATED BY A WHITE LINE
MISS BIRDSEYE DOESN'T GIVE PARTIES
HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER ATTRACTIVE BUT IT WASN'T TILL THIS SEASON THAT HIS EYES HAD BEEN FULLY OPENED
WELL IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE SAID MRS TARRANT
I AM SO AFRAID I SHALL LOSE YOU
IT WOULD BE A NEW ERA FOR THE HUMAN FAMILY AND THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAD HELPED TO SHOW THE WAY AND LEAD THE SQUADRONS WOULD BE THE BRIGHTEST IN THE TABLES OF FAME
SHE PURSUED HER MEDICAL STUDIES FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND MISS BIRDSEYE WHO WAS NOTHING OF A SLEEPER MARY PRANCE PRECISELY HAD WANTED TO TREAT HER FOR IT HAD HEARD HER IN THE STILLNESS OF THE SMALL HOURS WITH HER OPEN WINDOWS SHE HAD FRESH AIR ON THE BRAIN SHARPENING INSTRUMENTS IT WAS MISS BIRDSEYE'S MILD BELIEF THAT SHE DISSECTED IN A LITTLE PHYSIOLOGICAL LABORATORY WHICH SHE HAD SET UP IN HER BACK ROOM THE ROOM WHICH IF SHE HADN'T BEEN A DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER CHAMBER AND PERHAPS WAS EVEN WITH THE DISSECTING MISS BIRDSEYE DIDN'T KNOW
THIS FRIEND MR BURRAGE WAS FROM NEW YORK
IN PUBLIC
III WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WOULD TAKE HIM AS HE WAS HE SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO DINE WITH HER SHE EXCUSED HERSELF A MOMENT AND WENT TO GIVE AN ORDER IN THE DINING-ROOM
BUT THAT SCARCELY MADE IT MORE COMPREHENSIBLE SUCH A SENTIMENT ON HIS PART BEING SUCH A CURIOUS MIXTURE
AND SHE WENT TO PREPARE HERSELF
THE OTHERS DREW VERENA INTO THE HOUSE
IT BROUGHT BACK TO HER WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED ALREADY FROM THE IDEA THAT HE LAID HIS HANDS UPON HER TO MAKE HER SPEAK
YET NONE THE LESS TEARS OF WRATH ROSE MORE THAN ONCE TO OLIVE'S EYES WHEN SHE REFLECTED THAT THIS PARTICULAR WRONG HAD BEEN PUT UPON HER
WITH HER BRIGHT VULGAR CLOTHES HER SALIENT APPEARANCE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A ROPE-DANCER OR A FORTUNE-TELLER
MEANWHILE VERENA MORE AND MORE WITHDRAWN INTO HERSELF BUT PERFECTLY UNDISTURBED BY THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF HER MYSTIC FACULTY TURNED YET AGAIN VERY PRETTILY TO MRS FARRINDER AND ASKED HER IF SHE WOULDN'T STRIKE OUT--JUST TO GIVE HER COURAGE
WHEN WOMEN FEEL AS YOU DO HOW CAN I DOUBT THAT WE SHALL COME OUT ALL RIGHT OH WE SHALL COME OUT ALL RIGHT I GUESS MURMURED MISS BIRDSEYE
THE YOUNG MAN WAS THEREFORE FREE TO LOOK AT HER
SHE WOULD FASCINATE THE PEOPLE JUST AS SHE HAD FASCINATED HER MISS CHANCELLOR AND HE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO ADD HIMSELF
HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE COMPANY WITH ALL HIS TEETH AND SAID THAT THESE FLATTERING ALLUSIONS WERE NOT SO EMBARRASSING AS THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE INASMUCH AS ANY SUCCESS THAT HE AND HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT HAVE HAD WAS SO THOROUGHLY IMPERSONAL
IT TOOK AT MOMENTS ALL HER BELIEF IN HIS GENIUS TO SUSTAIN HER
AND THE TONE OF THIS SUGGESTION MADE OLIVE FEEL HOW RIGHT SHE HAD BEEN TO FORESEE THAT THEIR INTERVIEW WOULD HAVE THE STAMP OF BUSINESS
SHE HAD HAD IMMENSE SUCCESS AND MRS TARRANT AS SHE TOOK HER INTO HER ARMS AND KISSED HER WAS CERTAINLY ABLE TO FEEL THAT THE AUDIENCE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED
SHE TRANSFERRED HER ATTENTION TO THE GIRL WHO NOW HELD MRS FARRINDER'S HAND IN BOTH HER OWN AND WAS PLEADING WITH HER JUST TO PRELUDE A LITTLE
SHE WAS PROCEEDING TO LEAD HIM TOWARD MISS TARRANT WHEN OLIVE CHANCELLOR ROSE ABRUPTLY FROM HER CHAIR AND LAID HER HAND WITH AN ARRESTING MOVEMENT ON THE ARM OF HER HOSTESS
WHEN VERENA TARRANT MOVED US ALL SO
SHE WAS PERPLEXED SOMETIMES BY HER WORLDLINESS
SHE MENTIONED HIM TO MRS FARRINDER WHO EXPRESSED AN EARNEST HOPE THAT IF HE WERE OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES WHICH WERE SO DEAR TO THE REST OF THEM HE MIGHT BE INDUCED TO TAKE THE FLOOR AND TESTIFY ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
OLIVE OF COURSE HELD THAT HOME-CULTURE WAS PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE WIDEST EMANCIPATION IT WAS WITH A PERFECTLY GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT VERENA COMPLIED WITH BASIL RANSOM'S REQUEST
THESE THINGS HAD LEFT NO TRACE UPON HER PERSON OR HER MIND
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER WHOLE MANNER WHICH SEEMED TO SAY TO OLIVE THAT SHE BELONGED TO A LARGER WORLD THAN HERS
PERHAPS I AM CRUEL
IT WAS PERFECTLY OBSERVABLE THAT SHE HAD NO CONSCIENCE AND IT IRRITATED OLIVE DEEPLY TO SEE HOW MUCH TROUBLE A WOMAN WAS SPARED WHEN SHE WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THAT SYSTEM
SHE LOOKED VERY YOUNG AND SLIM AND FAIR AS MRS FARRINDER MADE WAY FOR HER ON THE SOFA WHICH OLIVE CHANCELLOR HAD QUITTED
SELAH WANDERED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN WITH HIS COLLECTION OF CAKES AND MR PARDON BEGAN TO TALK TO OLIVE ABOUT VERENA TO SAY THAT HE FELT AS IF HE COULDN'T SAY ALL HE DID FEEL WITH REGARD TO THE INTEREST SHE HAD SHOWN IN HER
BESIDES WHICH IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HIM TO HAVE PECUNIARY RELATIONS WITH A LADY WHO HAD NOT THE ART OF CONCEALING FROM HIM THAT SHE LIKED TO PLACE HIM UNDER OBLIGATIONS
AND HE MIGHT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE HAD CONTRIBUTED IN HIS MEASURE AND ON BEHALF OF A VIGILANT PUBLIC OPINION THE PRIDE OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE TO THE GREAT END OF PREVENTING THE AMERICAN CITIZEN FROM ATTEMPTING CLANDESTINE JOURNEYS
I KNOW ALL SHE HAS GOT TO SAY WELL WHAT IS IT THEN SINCE SHE CONTINUES TO REMAIN SILENT WELL WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS JUST THAT WOMEN WANT TO HAVE A BETTER TIME
ANY MAN THAT ONE WOULD LOOK AT--WITH HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE IT IS WAR UPON US TO THE KNIFE
BUT IT WAS A PROOF THAT FREEDOM WAS EVERYWHERE IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW TO LOOK FOR IT
IT WAS NOT SO RELIGIOUS AS GOING TO EVENING-SERVICE AT KING'S CHAPEL
SHE WOULD HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO TAKE IT FOR NO ONE HAD COME IN YET
SHE GAVE NO SIGN OF OBSERVING HER KINSMAN'S APPROACH
SHE EXPANDED DEVELOPED ON THE MOST LIBERAL SCALE
I CAN SEE PRETTY FAR BUT I CAN'T SEE ALL THE WAY TO BOSTON AND THEN IN EXPLAINING THAT IT WAS AT THIS PORT THAT HER SISTER HAD DISEMBARKED MRS LUNA FURTHER INQUIRED WHETHER HE COULD IMAGINE OLIVE DOING ANYTHING IN A FIRST-RATE WAY AS LONG AS THERE WERE INFERIOR ONES
BUT HE WORE A TALL HAT NOW LIKE A NORTHERN GENTLEMAN AND ADELINE INTIMATED THAT SHE FOUND HIM REALLY ATTRACTIVE
SHE HAD BLINKED AND COMPROMISED AND SHUFFLED
HE LOOKED AT MRS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
THE BARREN GAS-LIGHTED ROOM GREW RICHER AND RICHER TO HER EARNEST EYES
SHE RETURNED IN TEN MINUTES IN HER BONNET WHICH SHE HAD APPARENTLY ASSUMED IN RECOGNITION OF MISS BIRDSEYE'S ASCETICISM
IT WAS WITH THIS QUICK SURVEY OMITTING NOTHING THAT OLIVE TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
IN THE FUTURE SHE SHOULD HAVE EXCEEDING LUXURY AND EASE AND MISS CHANCELLOR HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING HERSELF THAT PERSONS DOING THE HIGH INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL WORK TO WHICH THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IN CHARLES STREET WERE NOW COMMITTED OWED IT TO THEMSELVES OWED IT TO THE GROANING SISTERHOOD TO CULTIVATE THE BEST MATERIAL CONDITIONS
BUT WE WILL SETTLE THAT IN NEW YORK
IT QUITE RAISES MY APPETITE FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE
THE SACRIFICES THE BLOOD THE TEARS THE TERRORS WERE THEIRS
HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE STUPID AND UNSKILLED AND HE WAS FINALLY OBLIGED TO CONFESS TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNPRACTICAL
MISS OLIVE CHANCELLOR IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER TO WHOM IN THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY I SHALL BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF IMPARTING MUCH OCCULT INFORMATION WAS SUBJECT TO FITS OF TRAGIC SHYNESS DURING WHICH SHE WAS UNABLE TO MEET EVEN HER OWN EYES IN THE MIRROR
HE SAYS THAT IF I BECOME HIS WIFE I SHALL BE CARRIED STRAIGHT ALONG BY A FORCE OF EXCITEMENT OF WHICH AT PRESENT I HAVE NO IDEA
THIS YOUNG LADY HAD DELIVERED HERSELF WITH EVEN FINER EFFECT THAN BEFORE AND OLIVE COULD SEE HOW MUCH SHE HAD GAINED IN CONFIDENCE AND RANGE OF ALLUSION SINCE THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS IN CHARLES STREET BEGAN
SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO FIGURE AND PRESENTED A CERTAIN APPEARANCE OF FEELING COLD
HIS APPEARANCE WAS PERFECTLY RECONCILABLE WITH A LARGE DEGREE OF LITERARY ENTERPRISE
SHE MADE NO DIRECT ALLUSION HOWEVER TO HER PARTICULAR VIEWS AND ASKED HER NO QUESTION ABOUT HER GIFT"--AN OMISSION WHICH VERENA THOUGHT STRANGE AND WITH THE MOST SPECULATIVE CANDOUR SPOKE OF TO OLIVE AFTERWARDS
THE SPIRIT YOU KNOW
OH OF COURSE SHE FASCINATED EVERY ONE SAID MRS LUNA
SUCH A MOOD HOWEVER COULD ONLY BE MOMENTARY FOR HE WAS CONSCIOUS AT BOTTOM OF A BIGGER STOMACH THAN ALL THE CULTURE OF CHARLES STREET COULD FILL
IT IS VERY SIMPLE WHAT I ASK OF YOU
IT WAS IN THIS POOR YOUNG LADY'S NATURE TO BE ANXIOUS TO HAVE SCRUPLE WITHIN SCRUPLE AND TO FORECAST THE CONSEQUENCES OF THINGS
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THAT HE WAS NOT EAGER FOR THE CHANGES SHE ADVOCATED AND WISHED TO SHOW HIM THAT ESPECIALLY TO A SOUTHERNER WHO HAD BITTEN THE DUST HER SEX COULD BE MAGNANIMOUS
SHE HAD BECOME CONSCIOUS OF HIS SOMEWHAT SOMBRE FIGURE UPLIFTED AGAINST THE WALL NEAR THE DOOR
RANSOM COULD SEE FOR HIMSELF THAT THE OCCASION WAS NOT CRUDELY FESTIVE
TO BE QUIET ABOUT THE SOUTHERN LAND NOT TO TOUCH HER WITH VULGAR HANDS TO LEAVE HER ALONE WITH HER WOUNDS AND HER MEMORIES NOT PRATING IN THE MARKET-PLACE EITHER OF HER TROUBLES OR HER HOPES BUT WAITING AS A MAN SHOULD WAIT FOR THE SLOW PROCESS THE SENSIBLE BENEFICENCE OF TIME--THIS WAS THE DESIRE OF RANSOM'S HEART AND HE WAS AWARE OF HOW LITTLE IT COULD MINISTER TO THE ENTERTAINMENT OF MISS BIRDSEYE'S GUESTS
THE WEATHER WAS BRILLIANT ENOUGH TO MINISTER TO ANY ILLUSION AND HE STROLLED ALONG THE STREETS TAKING IT IN
THE COAST WAS NOW PERFECTLY CLEAR
ALL THE RICH MEN SHE HAD SEEN ALREADY HAD WIVES AND THE UNMARRIED MEN WHO WERE GENERALLY VERY YOUNG WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM EACH OTHER NOT SO MUCH BY THE FIGURE OF THEIR INCOME WHICH CAME LITTLE INTO QUESTION AS BY THE DEGREE OF THEIR INTEREST IN REGENERATING IDEAS
OLIVE CHANCELLOR HELD HER HAND A MOMENT LONGER LOOKED AT HER IN FAREWELL AND THEN SAYING COME MR RANSOM DREW HIM OUT OF THE ROOM
MUCH CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL AND REFORMATORY TOPICS WENT FORWARD UNDER HER ROOF AND SHE RECEIVED HER COLLEAGUES--SHE BELONGED TO TWENTY ASSOCIATIONS AND COMMITTEES--ONLY AT PRE-APPOINTED HOURS WHICH SHE EXPECTED THEM TO OBSERVE RIGIDLY
HUMAN EXISTENCE TO HIM INDEED WAS A HUGE PUBLICITY IN WHICH THE ONLY FAULT WAS THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MISS CHANCELLOR MEANT TO DO BECAUSE IF SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO ANYTHING HE HAD AN IDEA--WHICH HE WOULDN'T CONCEAL FROM HER--OF GOING INTO THE ENTERPRISE HIMSELF
WELL MIND YOU COME AND SEE ME IN NEW YORK
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO OLIVE REPLIED TO THIS
THEN SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW HER BUT SHE GUESSED SHE KNEW OTHERS LIKE HER--SHE WENT TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY WERE SICK
HE WAS PERFECTLY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NEVER GO NEAR HER AGAIN
AND IT WAS REJOINED THAT THEY COULDN'T EXPECT TO HAVE A GREAT MANY--THE STYLE WAS SO PECULIAR
AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE GIRL TALKED OF THE CONCERTS TO ALL OF WHICH OLIVE SUBSCRIBED AND CONDUCTED HER INSEPARABLE FRIEND THAT MRS TARRANT APPEARED TO FEEL IN ANY DEGREE THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS LIVING UP TO THE STANDARD FORMED FOR HER IN THEIR CAMBRIDGE HOME
NOT THAT HE CARED
VERENA WILL BE VERY GLAD TO VISIT YOU
IT HAD ALREADY BEEN A COMFORT TO HER ON OCCASIONS OF ACUTE FEELING THAT SHE HATED MEN AS A CLASS ANYWAY
AND AS THEY SAT LOOKING AT THE GREAT FLORID SOMBRE ORGAN OVERHANGING THE BRONZE STATUE OF BEETHOVEN THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY TEMPLE IN WHICH THE VOTARIES OF THEIR CREED COULD WORSHIP
HE HAD SUPPOSED IT WAS TO BE A LONG ABSENCE THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WANTED PERHAPS TO GET THE LITTLE PROPHETESS AWAY FROM HER PARENTS POSSIBLY EVEN AWAY FROM SOME AMOROUS ENTANGLEMENT
I SEE YOUR DANGER STILL BUT I SEE OTHER THINGS TOO AND I HAVE RECOVERED MY BALANCE
I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED NOT TO LECTURE IN THE SOUTHERN CITIES AH MADAM THAT WAS VERY CRUEL ADVICE--FOR US BASIL RANSOM EXCLAIMED WITH GALLANTRY
THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE PLACE STRUCK HIM AS BOSTONIAN
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK FOR THAT SO IT COMES TO THE SAME SHE WENT ON
SHE PRAYED HEAVEN THAT SHE MIGHT NEVER BECOME SO PERSONAL SO NARROW
YET AT THE SAME TIME SHE ADMIRED HIM FOR AN IMPUDENCE SO CONSUMMATE THAT IT HAD ENDED IN THE FACE OF MORTIFICATIONS EXPOSURES FAILURES ALL THE MISERY OF A HAND-TO-MOUTH EXISTENCE BY IMPOSING ITSELF ON HER AS A KIND OF INFALLIBILITY
I WANT TO WORK FOR THEIR EMANCIPATION
THE BATTLE HAD BEGUN AND SOMETHING OF THE ECSTASY OF THE MARTYR
SHE WAS SO GLAD HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED
WHAT DO YOU CALL SUCCESS OLIVE INQUIRED LOOKING AT HER FRIEND WITH A KIND OF SALUTARY COLDNESS--A SUSPENSION OF SYMPATHY--WITH WHICH VERENA WAS NOW FAMILIAR THOUGH SHE LIKED IT NO BETTER THAN AT FIRST AND WHICH MADE APPROBATION MORE GRACIOUS WHEN APPROBATION CAME
SHE THEN AND THERE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM OTHERS SHOULD THEY BE NECESSARY
SMILED BECAUSE SHE LIKED TO SMILE TO PLEASE TO FEEL HER SUCCESS--OR WAS IT BECAUSE SHE WAS A PERFECT LITTLE ACTRESS AND THIS WAS PART OF HER TRAINING
YOU MUST LET ME KNOW BECAUSE BETWEEN THIS AND YOUR NEXT VISIT I SHALL HAVE TIME TO GO TO EUROPE AND COME BACK
AND IT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE REIGN OF JUSTICE WHICH THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO BRING ABOUT THAT SUCH A STRICT ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF EVERY LITTLE SNUB
ALL HER DESIRE WAS TO LEARN AND IT MUST BE ADDED THAT SHE REGARDED HER MOTHER IN PERFECT GOOD FAITH AS A WONDERFUL TEACHER
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM--AS THEY WISHED AS YOU WISHED AND I DIDN'T--I DON'T CARE FOR THEM
SHE PRONOUNCED EVERY SYLLABLE OF EVERY WORD AND INSISTED ON BEING EXPLICIT
AND WHEN HE HAD CORRECTED THIS IMPRESSION SHE ADDED IN A TONE WHICH SHOWED WITH WHAT POSITIVE CONFIDENCE HE HAD NOW INSPIRED HER HADN'T YOU BETTER DROP IN IT WOULD GIVE MISS CHANCELLOR NO PLEASURE BASIL RANSOM REJOINED
HE HAD TRAVELLED OUT TO CAMBRIDGE THE OTHER WINTER WHEN HE COULD GET AN OFF-NIGHT WITH THE THERMOMETER AT TEN BELOW ZERO
MISS BIRDSEYE REASONED MUCH LESS AND DID NOT OFFER TO INTRODUCE HIM TO VERENA TARRANT WHO WAS APPARENTLY BEING PRESENTED BY HER PARENTS TO A GROUP OF FRIENDS AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
SHE HAD LATENT CURIOSITIES AND DISTRACTIONS--LEFT TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOT ALWAYS THINKING OF THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
SHE EXPLAINED TO HER THAT SHE MUST GO THAT SHE WAS NOT VERY WELL THAT HER CARRIAGE WAS THERE
FIRST I CATCH ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER
SHE WAS GOING TO A SMALL GATHERING AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND WHO HAD ASKED A FEW PEOPLE INTERESTED IN NEW IDEAS TO MEET MRS FARRINDER
TO SPEAK SERIOUSLY HE ADDED I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THEN WELL I WANT TO MAKE HISTORY
SHE HAD HER OWN WAYS OF THINKING OF IT WHICH WERE NOT HER MOTHER'S AND IF SHE LENT HERSELF TO THIS LADY'S EXTENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS IT WAS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF
IT TAKES IN EVEN YOU MISS CHANCELLOR OLIVE ROSE TO HER FEET HESITATING
I HAVE NEVER LAID EYES ON ONE BASIL RANSOM ADDED
HE DIDN'T CARE FOR THAT HE SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD IT
AT OTHERS SHE THOUGHT THAT EVERY ONE WHO LOOKED AT HER WISHED TO INSULT HER
SHE COULDN'T MAKE OUT VERY EXACTLY BY VERENA WHAT SHE THOUGHT
WELL YOU ARE NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT AFTER ALL TO TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE ABOUT THE SOUTH--IF THEY COULD HAVE GUESSED HOW LITTLE HE CARED TO DO IT
IT TOOK OLIVE TO INVENT SUCH MONSTROSITIES AND TO THINK SHE WAS DOING SOMETHING GREAT FOR HUMANITY WHEN SHE DID SO
IT WAS AN IMMENSE PITY--SHE HERSELF WAS GOING OUT
SHE HAD IT ONLY AT CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS
HE WAS QUITE UNDER THE SPELL AND HIS ADMIRATION MADE HIM WANT TO SEE HER WHERE SHE BELONGED
ONE OF THE LADIES HAD ASKED FOR IT AND MR PARDON HAD JUST STEPPED DOWN TO DRAW SOME
BUT IT TOOK HER QUICK SENSIBILITY ONLY A MOMENT TO DISCOVER THAT HER FRIEND WAS NOT PLEASED
SHE WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOOT TO BOYLSTON STREET AND THERE SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE PUBLIC CONVEYANCE IN HER HEART SHE LOATHED IT TO THE SOUTH END
IT WAS A PART OF HIS SOUTHERN GALLANTRY--HIS ACCENT ALWAYS CAME OUT STRONGLY WHEN HE SAID ANYTHING OF THAT SORT--AND IT COMMITTED HIM TO NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
IF SUCH AN EVENT AS THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD GRATIFY HER SENSE OF FITNESS IT WOULD BE SIMPLY AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF CERTAIN LAWS
IT FILLED HER WITH EXASPERATION TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO THE HAPPINESS OF HIS VICTIMS SHE HAD LEARNED THAT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT TALK ABOUT WITH HER IT WAS OF HIM AND HIM ONLY THAT THEY DISCOURSED AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE OF THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE EVENING CLUB FOR HER FATIGUED UNDERPAID SISTERS WHICH IT HAD LONG BEEN HER DREAM TO ESTABLISH WAS THAT IT WOULD IN SOME DEGREE UNDERMINE HIS POSITION--DISTINCT AS HER PREVISION MIGHT BE THAT HE WOULD BE IN WAITING AT THE DOOR
WHY SHOULDN'T TENDERNESS COME IN
IT ISN'T SINGING YOU'LL SEE MRS TARRANT DECLARED
THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW PEOPLE SHE TREATED THEM AS IF SHE RECOGNISED THEM
WELL GOOD-NIGHT MISS CHANCELLOR SHE WENT ON
WHAT COMPLETED THE CHARACTER OF THIS INTERIOR WAS MISS BIRDSEYE'S OWN APARTMENT INTO WHICH HER GUESTS PRESENTLY MADE THEIR WAY AND WHERE THEY WERE JOINED BY VARIOUS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOOD LADY'S CIRCLE
OH IF SHE WAS HIS CHILD SHE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE SOME GIFT--IF IT WAS ONLY THE GIFT OF THE G----WELL SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT
OH YES I PLACE YOU NOW
HER TIGHT BODICE SEEMED TO CRACK WITH HER VIVACITY
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD NO TASTES
MR PARDON EVIDENTLY TOOK AN INTEREST AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS APPEARANCE THAT SEEMED TO SAY THAT HIS SYMPATHY WOULD NOT BE DANGEROUS
MRS FARRINDER BENT A BENIGNANT BROW UPON HER IN SPITE OF HER BEING EVIDENTLY RATHER A SURPRISE
MY DEAR COUSIN YOUR TRUTH IS A MOST VAIN THING GRACIOUS ME CRIED VERENA TARRANT
IF HE WANTED TO SEND FOR HIM
THE LIVELIEST RELATION HAD ESTABLISHED ITSELF AND THE LATTER GENTLEMAN IN ESPECIAL ABOUNDED IN APPRECIATIVE LAUGHTER
SHE WOULD REFORM THE SOLAR SYSTEM IF SHE COULD GET HOLD OF IT
NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL ME THIS BASIL RANSOM SAID LEANING FORWARD TOWARDS VERENA WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES AND COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO HIS HOSTESS
THE READER PERHAPS SEES THE GESTURE WITH WHICH IN HIS COLLOQUIES WITH HIMSELF HE ACCOMPANIED THIS MENTAL IMAGE
IT SEEMED AS IF VERENA CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF IT TOO FOR HER FACE KINDLED STILL MORE AND SHE SAID SHE SHOULD LIKE THAT EVER SO MUCH
SHE LOOKED LIKE A BOY AND NOT EVEN LIKE A GOOD BOY
IF HE SHOULD NOT COME SHE SHOULD BE ANNOYED AND IF HE SHOULD COME SHE SHOULD BE FURIOUS
IF THAT WERE TRUE SHE SAID I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE--A CULTIVATED VOICE--AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MRS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE RANSOM REPLIED
WE ARE REQUIRED FOR SOMETHING ELSE AND MISS BIRDSEYE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A WANDERING TENTATIVE HUMOUR AS IF HE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT
AT ANY RATE IF HE WAS BORED HE COULD SPEAK TO SOME ONE
I KNOW SEVERAL THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE
THIS CONSISTED IN THE WONDERFUL INSIGHT THEY HAD OBTAINED INTO THE HISTORY OF FEMININE ANGUISH
VERENA WAS EVIDENTLY VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO OLIVE THAT SHE HAD ASSURED HIM SHE COULDN'T THINK OF IT AND THAT IF HE EXPECTED THIS HE HAD BETTER NOT COME ANY MORE
BUT IT WENT HARD WITH HER AND SHE WAS ALTOGETHER DISCOMPOSED
VERENA SEEMS TO BE HAVING SUCH A TIME WITH THOSE GENTLEMEN
THE APARTMENT CONTAINED LITTLE ELSE BUT THESE CHAIRS MANY OF WHICH HAD A BORROWED ASPECT AN IMPLICATION OF BARE BEDROOMS IN THE UPPER REGIONS
SHE BEGAN TO SEE WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE THOUGH SHE ALSO SAW THAT SHE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE TO WAIT AWHILE
WHAT IS IT THEN MR TARRANT UNFURLED HIS WRINKLES SHOWED HIS BACK TEETH
MR BURRAGE LISTENS EVEN BETTER THAN HE TALKS HIS COMPANION DECLARED
RANSOM WONDERED WHETHER HE WOULDN'T PUT HER TO SLEEP
AS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THE OPPORTUNITIES IN BOSTON FOR HEARING GOOD MUSIC ARE NUMEROUS AND EXCELLENT AND IT HAD LONG BEEN MISS CHANCELLOR'S PRACTICE TO CULTIVATE THE BEST
BUT DO TAKE ME
MRS FARRINDER WAS NOT WEAK OF COURSE AND SHE BROUGHT A GREAT INTELLECT TO THE MATTER
SO THAT REMARKING HIS TONE AND THE SLIGHT FLUSH OF ANNOYANCE THAT ROSE TO HIS FACE MRS LUNA WAS QUICK ENOUGH TO JUDGE THAT SHE HAD OVERSTEPPED THE MARK
SHE SEEMS TO BE REALISING ALL THE TIME
I WOULD KEEP VERY QUIET IF I THOUGHT THAT
NOW HOWEVER SHE ELEVATED DAINTINESS TO A RELIGION
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A TREE IN NEXT WEEK
THE MATTER OF HER COMING TO STAY FOR SO LONG IN CHARLES STREET WAS ARRANGED DURING A VISIT THAT SELAH TARRANT PAID THERE AT MISS CHANCELLOR'S REQUEST
HE REMINDED HER THAT HE HAD KNOWN MISS VERENA A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN SHE
WELL I AM ALWAYS ROUND THE STREETS IN BOSTON AND WHILE LIFTING AND PUSHING HE WAS HELPING AGAIN TO INSERT HER INTO THE OBLONG RECEPTACLE SHE TURNED A LITTLE AND REPEATED SHE WILL AFFECT YOU
BUT IT PROVES SHE IS THE UNIVERSAL CAUSE
UNCOUNTED MILLIONS HAD LIVED ONLY TO BE TORTURED TO BE CRUCIFIED
ONE LITTLE THING SUCCEEDED ANOTHER
SHE SAW IT IN THE LIGHT OF AN ACTIVE ENTHUSIASTIC FAITH
IF VERENA MADE A GREAT SACRIFICE OF FILIAL DUTY IN COMING TO LIVE WITH HER THIS OF COURSE SHOULD BE PERMANENT--SHE WOULD BUY OFF THE TARRANTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR SHE MUST NOT INCUR THE IMPUTATION THE WORLD WOULD JUDGE HER IN THAT CASE FEROCIOUSLY OF KEEPING HER FROM FORMING COMMON SOCIAL TIES
IN THAT LANGUID AIR YOU WOULD DOZE DELICIOUSLY WELL I DON'T WANT TO BE LANGUID SAID MISS BIRDSEYE
WELL YOU ARE IMPRESSED TOO SAID MISS BIRDSEYE LOOKING AT HER PHILOSOPHICALLY
SHE MIGHT KNOW THAT A MAN COULDN'T RECOGNISE MISS CHANCELLOR IN SUCH A DESCRIPTION AS THAT
IT WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT ONE MIGHT TAKE UP OR LEAVE ALONE AS ONE PLEASED
AND SHE HAD A LARGE RED FAN WHICH SHE KEPT CONSTANTLY IN MOVEMENT
HE ABOUNDED IN PRETEXTS
THEN INDEED SHE SCARCELY RECOGNISED THEM
SHE HERSELF HAD HAD A PHASE SOME TIME AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH--HER MOTHER'S HAD PRECEDED HIS--WHEN SHE BOUGHT THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CHARLES STREET AND BEGAN TO LIVE ALONE DURING WHICH SHE ACCOMPANIED GENTLEMEN TO RESPECTABLE PLACES OF AMUSEMENT
BUT SHE WAS NOT EAGER ABOUT THIS VISION FOR THE IMPLICATIONS OF MATRIMONY WERE FOR THE MOST PART WANTING IN BRIGHTNESS--CONSISTED OF A TIRED WOMAN HOLDING A BABY OVER A FURNACE-REGISTER THAT EMITTED LUKEWARM AIR
SHE REMAINED THERE LOOKING OUT
THEY WERE ALL DECLINED WITH THANKS AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ACCENT OF HIS LANGUID CLIME BROUGHT HIM LUCK AS LITTLE UNDER THE PEN AS ON THE LIPS HAD NOT ANOTHER EXPLANATION BEEN SUGGESTED BY ONE OF THE MORE EXPLICIT OF HIS ORACLES IN RELATION TO A PAPER ON THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES
HE HAD TAKEN A WRONG IMPRESSION FROM WHAT MRS LUNA SAID NEARLY A YEAR BEFORE ABOUT HER SISTER'S VISIT TO EUROPE
I AM NOT SO BAD AS MISS CHANCELLOR THINKS ME OH I PRESUME YOU HAVE YOUR IDEAS SAID MISS BIRDSEYE
SHE HAD BEGUN TO ATTEND LECTURES AS SHE SAID WHEN SHE WAS QUITE AN INFANT BECAUSE HER MOTHER HAD NO ONE TO LEAVE HER WITH AT HOME
SHE FOUND HERSELF COMPLETELY ENROLLED IN THE GREAT IRREGULAR ARMY OF NOSTRUM-MONGERS DOMICILED IN HUMANITARY BOHEMIA
HE GLANCED AT THE CLOCK SAW IT WAS NOT YET LATE TOOK A TURN ABOUT THE ROOM THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT PLACE WHILE SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH HER EYES WONDERING WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
YES I AM DREADFUL
TARRANT WAS A MORALIST WITHOUT MORAL SENSE--THAT WAS VERY CLEAR TO OLIVE AS SHE LISTENED TO THE HISTORY OF HIS DAUGHTER'S CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH WHICH VERENA RELATED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY ARTLESS VIVIDNESS
SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS VERY MAGNETIC THAT IN FACT WAS HIS GENIUS AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS HIS MAGNETISM THAT HELD HER TO HIM
WHEN SHE WENT TO MISS BIRDSEYE'S IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE RE-ENTERED SOCIETY
WHAT WAS HER NAME?--MISS TARRANT
THAT WOULD BE THE WAY POETIC JUSTICE OUGHT TO WORK FOR HIM--AND THE LAW THAT OUR PREJUDICES WHEN THEY ACT THEMSELVES OUT PUNISH US IN DOING SO
SHE WAS NOT A QUIET GIRL
BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD NO INTERESTS BEYOND THE RESEARCHES FROM WHICH THIS EVENING SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND WAS INCAPABLE OF ASKING HIM A PERSONAL QUESTION
IT'S A VERY CLOSE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL TIE AND WE THINK EVERYTHING OF IT HERE
SHE WAS HEROIC SHE WAS SUBLIME THE WHOLE MORAL HISTORY OF BOSTON WAS REFLECTED IN HER DISPLACED SPECTACLES
BASIL RANSOM GOT OUT
I AM AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSED AND DRY WHEN THIS YOUNG LADY AFTER A STRUGGLE WITH THE WINDS AND WAVES OF EMOTION EMERGED INTO THE QUIET STREAM OF A CERTAIN HIGH REASONABLENESS SHE PRESENTED HER MOST GRACEFUL ASPECT
HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THIS FAIR FLOWER MAY BE NIPPED WHEN IT IS SO TENDER A BUD AS SCARCELY TO BE PALPABLE
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S DEPARTURE ACCOMPANIED BY HER YOUNG COMPANION HAD CHECKED AT THE TIME ON RANSOM'S PART A CERTAIN HABIT OF IDLE BUT NONE THE LESS ENTERTAINING RETROSPECT
OLIVE WONDERED WHAT LAW-BUSINESS ADELINE COULD HAVE AND HOPED SHE WOULD GET INTO A PICKLE WITH HER LANDLORD OR HER MILLINER SO THAT REPEATED INTERVIEWS WITH MR RANSOM MIGHT BECOME NECESSARY
PEOPLE MIGHT BE FOUND ECCENTRIC ENOUGH TO VOTE FOR HIM IN MISSISSIPPI BUT MEANWHILE WHERE SHOULD HE FIND THE TWENTY-DOLLAR GREENBACKS WHICH IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO TRANSMIT FROM TIME TO TIME TO HIS FEMALE RELATIONS CONFINED SO CONSTANTLY TO A FARINACEOUS DIET
SHE WAS INTENSELY FEARFULLY A PERSON
THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
SHE SAID TO HER VISITOR THAT WHETHER OR NO THE ANGELS CAME DOWN TO HER IN GLITTERING ARMOUR SHE STRUCK HER AS THE ONLY PERSON SHE HAD YET ENCOUNTERED WHO HAD EXACTLY THE SAME TENDERNESS THE SAME PITY FOR WOMEN THAT SHE HERSELF HAD
IF OLIVE HAD NOT BEEN SO GRIM SHE WOULD HAVE HAD A SMILE TO SPARE FOR THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH THE GIRL HERSELF ADOPTED THIS THEORY
SHE WAS ABLE TO EXHIBIT IT TO VERENA WITH THE GREATEST AUTHORITY AND ACCURACY TO LEAD HER UP AND DOWN IN AND OUT THROUGH ALL THE DARKEST AND MOST TORTUOUS PASSAGES
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT BUT I DO LIKE MR BURRAGE AND MR GRACIE AND MR MATTHIAS PARDON
THEY HADN'T MUCH AS MISS CHANCELLOR COULD SEE
BUT HE ALSO INTIMATED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MISS CHANCELLOR LAID OUT TO DO WITH HER
SHE HAD WANTED HIM TO LOOK AFTER HER PROPERTY AND TO BE TUTOR TO HER SON
AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID TO VERENA EITHER BY HENRY BURRAGE OR BY HIS FRIEND GRACIE ABOUT HER ADDRESSING THE HARVARD STUDENTS
BUT WHAT HE MAINLY LIKED WAS TO PLAY HER OFF UPON THE OTHER GIRLS THE DAUGHTERS OF FASHION WITH WHOM HE DANCED AT PAPANTI'S
BUT IT ISN'T EVERYTHING SAID MRS LUNA PHILOSOPHICALLY
HOW MUCH
THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE VALUED MOST WAS WANTING--THAT OF OLIVE'S HAVING COME OUT TO CAMBRIDGE TO PAY THE VISIT THAT HAD BEEN SOLICITED FROM THE FIRST
SHE FELT HOWEVER THAT FOR THE PRESENT THERE WOULD BE NO ANSWER FOR HER SAVE IN THE MERE PRESSURE OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S EAGER NATURE THAT INTENSITY OF EMOTION WHICH MADE HER SUDDENLY EXCLAIM AS IF IN A NERVOUS ECSTASY OF ANTICIPATION BUT WE MUST WAIT
ONLY THE TRANSCRIPT
WHEN I HAVE ADDED THAT HE HATED TO SEE WOMEN EAGER AND ARGUMENTATIVE AND THOUGHT THAT THEIR SOFTNESS AND DOCILITY WERE THE INSPIRATION THE OPPORTUNITY THE HIGHEST OF MAN I SHALL HAVE SKETCHED A STATE OF MIND WHICH WILL DOUBTLESS STRIKE MANY READERS AS PAINFULLY CRUDE
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF ALL THESE MIDDLE-AGED FEMININE EYES CONSCIOUS OF CURLS RATHER LIMP THAT DEPENDED FROM DUSKY BONNETS OF HEADS POKED FORWARD AS IF WITH A WAITING LISTENING FAMILIAR HABIT OF NO ONE BEING VERY BRIGHT OR GAY--NO ONE AT LEAST BUT THAT GIRL HE HAD NOTICED BEFORE WHO HAD A BRILLIANT HEAD AND WHO NOW HOVERED ON THE EDGE OF THE CONCLAVE
WELL I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AT ANY RATE THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN WITH MUCH VOLUBILITY BY A FAIR PLUMP SMILING WOMAN WHO ENTERED A NARROW DRAWING-ROOM IN WHICH A VISITOR KEPT WAITING FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS ALREADY ABSORBED IN A BOOK
OLIVE RESPONDED TO THIS INVITATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH VERENA
MISS VERENA SEEMED TO HIM AS FAR OUT AS A YOUNG WOMAN COULD BE
I LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRENTS MRS FARRINDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
MANY OTHER PERSONS HAD MADE IT BEFORE THAT
HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BY THIS RETORT BUT GLIDED GRACEFULLY OFF TO THE QUESTION OF MOUNT DESERT
IT WAS A FACT THAT THIS FORTUNATE YOUTH CALLED VERY OFTEN AND VERENA SAW HIM WITH OLIVE'S FULL CONCURRENCE WHENEVER SHE WAS AT HOME
IT REMINDED HER OF QUALITIES THAT SHE BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN PROPER TO ELECTRA OR ANTIGONE
HE HIMSELF BY NATURE TOOK THINGS EASY
HE TRIED TO PUT IN SOMETHING THAT WOULD INTEREST ALL PARTIES
IT WAS ARRANGED THAT OLIVE SHOULD COME TO TEA THE REPAST THAT SELAH DESIGNATED AS HIS SUPPER WHEN MRS TARRANT AS WE HAVE SEEN DESIRED TO DO HER HONOUR BY INVITING ANOTHER GUEST
VERENA WAS FULL OF SUGGESTIONS WHICH STIMULATED DISCUSSIONS
SHE WANTED TO SAY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GO DOWN AGAIN IF SHE LIKED
I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE
THE GREENSTREETS HAD NEVER SET MUCH STORE ON MANUAL ACTIVITY
HE EVIDENTLY RECOGNISED HER AS A FREQUENT PASSENGER
COME OUT IN PUBLIC OLIVE REPEATED
AND A SMART BRIGHT WAGGON WITH THE HORSE DETACHED FROM THE SHAFTS DRAWN UP ON THE EDGE OF THE ABOMINABLE ROAD IT CONTAINED HOLES AND RUTS A FOOT DEEP AND IMMEMORIAL ACCUMULATIONS OF STAGNANT MUD IMPARTED AN IDLE RURAL PASTORAL AIR TO A SCENE OTHERWISE PERHAPS EXPRESSIVE OF A RANK CIVILISATION
NO ONE HAD AN IDEA HOW SHE LIVED
SO IT WAS FOR OLIVE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CHARLES STREET ADELINE BEING IN EUROPE TO DECIDE
SHE HAD A THEORY THAT HE PROPOSED TO ALMOST ANY GIRL WHO WAS NOT LIKELY TO ACCEPT HIM--DID IT BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING A COLLECTION OF SUCH EPISODES--A MENTAL ALBUM OF DECLARATIONS BLUSHES HESITATIONS REFUSALS THAT JUST MISSED IMPOSING THEMSELVES AS ACCEPTANCES QUITE AS HE COLLECTED ENAMELS AND CREMONA VIOLINS
HE TOOK THEM ALL IN FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM CERTAIN VERY INTERESTING FACTS
I AM IN NO HURRY TO STAY WITH OLIVE AGAIN
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
I AM SICK OF THAT WORD--ONE HEARS OF NOTHING ELSE IN AMERICA
SO I JUST ASKED YOU TO COME TO ME STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT PRELIMINARIES AND I BELIEVED YOU WOULD COME
ONLY SHE MUST HAVE A GLASS OF WATER FIRST
SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS OFFER BUT THAT HE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND VERENA AND HERSELF
I KNOW WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE--YOU EXPRESSED THEM LAST NIGHT IN SUCH BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE
AND TO DRAW FURTHER PROFIT FROM IT HE ASKED HER WHO THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH THE RED HAIR--THE PRETTY ONE WHOM HE HAD ONLY NOTICED DURING THE LAST TEN MINUTES
SHE SAYS I HAVE GOT THE GIFT OF EXPRESSION--IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM
IT WAS FORTUNATE PERHAPS THAT THE MISREPRESENTATION WAS SO GROSS
THIS YOUNG LADY GAVE A LAUGH THAT RESEMBLED SPEECH IN LIQUID FUSION
LEAST OF ALL COULD HE SUPPOSE THAT SHE WOULD BE INDIFFERENT TO HIS WANT OF INCOME--A POINT IN WHICH HE FAILED TO DO HER JUSTICE
IT WAS THE CHEAPEST WAY HE KNEW OF SPENDING AN EVENING
FOR SHE HATED THE WRITING OF THE FRENCH IN SPITE OF THE IMPORTANCE THEY HAVE GIVEN TO WOMEN
I AM ASHAMED OF BEING A MAN
PERHAPS SHE SHOULD TAKE A HOUSE IN WASHINGTON
IF HE HAD TAKEN A CONTRADICTIOUS TONE ON PURPOSE TO DRAW MRS LUNA OUT HE COULD NOT HAVE ELICITED MORE OF THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW HER TO ME
THE EXERCISE OF SUCH FEELINGS WAS FULL OF ADVANTAGE FOR BOTH SEXES AND THEY FLOWED MOST FREELY OF COURSE WHEN WOMEN WERE GRACIOUS AND GRATEFUL
MRS FARRINDER WILL FIX IT SHE SAID
LEAVE US ALONE--ENTIRELY ALONE--FOR A YEAR AND THEN I WILL WRITE YOU ANOTHER
SHE WAS A SPINSTER AS SHELLEY WAS A LYRIC POET OR AS THE MONTH OF AUGUST IS SULTRY
BASIL RANSOM WATCHED THESE PROCEEDINGS WITH MUCH INTEREST FOR THE GIRL AMUSED AND PLEASED HIM
WHY SHOULD HE SHARE AND WHAT WAS MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THE THINGS WHICH CONCERNED HER CLOSELY SHOULD NOT CONCERN HIM AT ALL
SHE WAS HELD TO HAVE A VERY FINE MANNER AND TO EMBODY THE DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND THE GRACES OF THE DRAWING-ROOM
MR BURRAGE AND MR GRACIE SAID THEY WOULD INVITE HER ON THE SPOT IN THE NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY
AND OLIVE LAID HER HAND SOLEMNLY ON HER HEART
SHE ACHED AND WAS WEARY GROWING ALMOST AS GLAD TO LOOK BACK A GREAT ANOMALY FOR MISS BIRDSEYE AS TO LOOK FORWARD
SHE HAD NOT IN FACT A VERY VIVID SENSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AGENTS OF FATE
BOSTON WAS FULL OF POOR GIRLS WHO HAD TO WALK ABOUT AT NIGHT AND TO SQUEEZE INTO HORSE-CARS IN WHICH EVERY SENSE WAS DISPLEASED
DON'T YOU KNOW SHE TOOK HER TO EUROPE
IT WAS EXACTLY AS IF SHE MRS LUNA HAD STRUCK UP AN INTIMACY WITH THE DAUGHTER OF HER CHIROPODIST
SHE KNEW THAT OLIVE'S INJUNCTION OUGHT NOT TO HAVE SURPRISED HER
FOR THIS WE MUST TRUST ONE ANOTHER WE MUST BE TRUE AND GENTLE AND KIND
HE HAD CONSIDERABLE MANY PATIENTS HE GOT ABOUT TWO DOLLARS A SITTING AND HE HAD EFFECTED SOME MOST GRATIFYING CURES
TO CAUSE ONE'S IDEAS TO BE EMBODIED IN NATIONAL CONDUCT APPEARED TO HIM THE HIGHEST FORM OF HUMAN ENJOYMENT
MR GRACIE WAS SHORT WITH A BIG HEAD
SHE WAS OFF SOMEWHERE NOW SINCE THAT EVENING BUT MISS BIRDSEYE HAD AN IDEA THAT WHEN SHE WAS BACK IN ROXBURY SHE WOULD SEND FOR VERENA AND GIVE HER A FEW POINTS
DIDN'T YOU KNOW I HAD BEEN TO EUROPE MRS LUNA WENT ON IN THE SLIGHTLY AGGRIEVED TONE OF A WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS THE LIMITS OF HER REPUTATION
HE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE BOOKS AND SAW THAT HIS COUSIN READ GERMAN
I FEEL IT AS ONE FEELS A STAIN THAT IS ON ONE'S HONOUR VERENA GAVE A CLEAR LAUGH AND AFTER THAT A SOFT SIGH AND THEN SAID DO YOU KNOW OLIVE I SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU I SHOULD FEEL IT SO VERY MUCH MY OWN FRIEND OLIVE REPLIED YOU HAVE NEVER YET SAID ANYTHING TO ME WHICH EXPRESSED SO CLEARLY THE CLOSENESS AND SANCTITY OF OUR UNION YOU DO KEEP ME UP VERENA WENT ON
FOR HER ADDRESS AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S SHOWED THAT SHE TOO LIKE OLIVE HERSELF HAD HAD THAT VISION IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
THEN AGAIN SHE APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING BUT HER SLIPPERS AND THE EVENING-PAPER FROM THIS PUBLICATION SHE DERIVED INSCRUTABLE SOLACE SO THAT IF MRS FOAT IN PERSON HAD RETURNED FROM THE SUMMER-LAND TO WHICH SHE HAD SOME TIME SINCE TAKEN HER FLIGHT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DISTURBED MRS TARRANT'S ALMOST CYNICAL EQUANIMITY
SHE COULD TRAVEL ROUND WITH HER AS HER COMPANION AND HE WOULD SEE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WALKED UP
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MISS OLIVE COME AWAY WITH ME AND I'LL EXPLAIN HER AS WE GO MRS LUNA WENT ON HAVING FINISHED HER TOILET
THEY HAD NO DESIRE TO BE NOTORIOUS
WHY WHAT'S THE USE OF THAT
HE WOULDN'T DENY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
IF SHE BELONGS TO YOU WHY DON'T YOU BRING HER OUT HE HAD NO PURPOSE AND NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING IMPERTINENT
HIS FOREHEAD WAS HIGH AND BROAD AND HIS THICK BLACK HAIR PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND GLOSSY AND WITHOUT ANY DIVISION ROLLED BACK FROM IT IN A LEONINE MANNER
BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE RANSOM SAW FOR THE ABSENCE OF ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH ATTACH A TEACHER TO A PUPIL
LOOSE FENCES VACANT LOTS MOUNDS OF REFUSE YARDS BESTREWN WITH IRON PIPES TELEGRAPH POLES AND BARE WOODEN BACKS OF PLACES
VERENA'S FORMER ATTITUDE HAD BEEN GIRLISH SUBMISSION GRATEFUL CURIOUS SYMPATHY
AND AS FOR OUR FOUR FEARFUL YEARS OF SLAUGHTER OF COURSE YOU WON'T DENY THAT THERE THE LADIES WERE THE GREAT MOTIVE POWER
SHE SPOKE TO HER AS IF THEY WERE EQUALS IN THAT RESPECT AS IF VERENA'S GENIUS AND FAME WOULD MAKE UP THE DISPARITY AND THE GIRL HAD NO NEED OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND PATRONAGE
BUT THEY HAD SEEMED AFRAID OF HER AND THE ATTEMPT HAD COME TO NOTHING
IT WAS HER NATURE TO LOOK OUT FOR DUTIES TO APPEAL TO HER CONSCIENCE FOR TASKS
THE STRONGER
SHE WAS ALWAYS SO TAKEN UP WITH OTHERS
I MUST REPEAT IT VERENA
ON THE OTHER HAND HER COMMENDATIONS HER SATISFACTIONS WERE AS SOFT AS A WEST WIND
SHE REGARDED HER SISTER AS QUITE TOO MUCH ONE OF THE PROFANE AND KNEW ADELINE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN SHE TOOK TO HERSELF A BOSOM-FRIEND SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT SUCH PAINS TO SELECT HER IN JUST THE MOST DREADFUL CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY
SHE HAD DONE THESE THINGS NOW AND SHE EXPRESSED TO HERSELF THE KIND OF MAN SHE BELIEVED HIM TO BE IN REFLECTING THAT IF SHE SHOULD OFFER HIM TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RENOUNCE ALL CLAIM TO VERENA KEEPING--HE AND HIS WIFE--CLEAR OF HER FOR THE REST OF TIME HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY WITH HIS FEARFUL SMILE MAKE IT TWENTY MONEY DOWN AND I'LL DO IT SOME IMAGE OF THIS TRANSACTION AS ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE FUTURE OUTLINED ITSELF FOR OLIVE AMONG THE MORAL INCISIONS OF THAT EVENING
THERE WAS NO HOSTILITY THERE
THAT SHE WOULD OPEN TO HER THE BEST SALOONS IN BOSTON
HE WAS SIMPLY THE DETESTED CARPET-BAGGER
HE WAS SO GOOD-HUMOURED SO AMUSING SO FRIENDLY AND CONSIDERATE SO ATTENTIVE TO MISS CHANCELLOR HE DID THE HONOURS OF HIS BACHELOR-NEST WITH SO EASY A GRACE THAT OLIVE PART OF THE TIME SAT DUMBLY SHAKING HER CONSCIENCE LIKE A WATCH THAT WOULDN'T GO TO MAKE IT TELL HER SOME BETTER REASON WHY SHE SHOULDN'T LIKE HIM
SHE HAD NO SUSPICIONS OF SOCIAL IMPORTANCE
SHE ONLY FELT THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE AN ABSOLUTE SANCTITY FOR VERENA AND WOULD BIND THEM TOGETHER FOR LIFE
THEY PERUSED THAT CHAPTER PERPETUALLY AND ZEALOUSLY AND THEY DERIVED FROM IT THE PUREST PART OF THEIR MISSION
I GUESS YOUR FATHER KNEW MY FATHER--MR GREENSTREET
THIS ATTENTIVE ORGAN EARNESTLY CONSULTED HAD REPRESENTED TO HER THAT HE WAS AN OFFSHOOT OF THE OLD SLAVE-HOLDING OLIGARCHY WHICH WITHIN HER OWN VIVID REMEMBRANCE HAD PLUNGED THE COUNTRY INTO BLOOD AND TEARS AND THAT AS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ABOMINATIONS HE WAS NOT A WORTHY OBJECT OF PATRONAGE FOR A PERSON WHOSE TWO BROTHERS--HER ONLY ONES--HAD GIVEN UP LIFE FOR THE NORTHERN CAUSE
NEVERTHELESS AFTER A DAY HAD ELAPSED HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE HER
THIS WOULD BE THE ATTRACTION FOR THE DARK-EYED YOUNG MAN HE LOOKED LIKE A GENIUS SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
SHE OUGHT TO WALK RIGHT UP TO THE TOP
SHE HAD ANALYSED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY FINENESS THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY THEIR SOFTNESS
HE WAS UNDER THIRTY IN SPITE OF HIS WHITE HAIR
SHE KNEW MR PARDON
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO SEE ME SITTING UNDER A TREE
SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM PAWING ROUND HER THAT WAY BEFORE SHE BEGAN
I CAME TO BID YOUR SISTER GOOD-BYE ARE YOU REALLY GOING
SOMETIMES SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A WONDER HOW SHE HAD DEVELOPED IN THE FACE OF SO MANY
SHE WOULD HAVE SAID MOREOVER THAT SHE STOOD IN NO ONE'S WAY AND THAT EVEN IF SHE WERE NOT THERE VERENA WOULD NEVER THINK SERIOUSLY OF A FRIVOLOUS LITTLE MAN WHO FIDDLED WHILE ROME WAS BURNING
WHY HADN'T SHE SAID AS SHE HAD DONE IN FORMER CASES THAT IF PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE THEM THEY COULD COME OUT TO THEIR HOME
IT SEEMS TO ME VERY POOR WHEN FRIENDSHIP AND FAITH AND CHARITY AND THE MOST INTERESTING OCCUPATION IN THE WORLD--WHEN SUCH A COMBINATION AS THIS DOESN'T SEEM BY ITSELF ENOUGH TO LIVE FOR
IT LIFTED THEM TO IMMEASURABLE HEIGHTS
THAT HER SPRINGING UP BETWEEN SELAH AND HIS WIFE WAS AN EXQUISITE WHIM OF THE CREATIVE FORCE
WHY IN THE WORLD HAD A PERVERSE FATE DECREED THAT TARRANT SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF WOMAN--AS IF SHE WANTED HIS AID TO ARRIVE AT HER GOAL
IT ISN'T OFTEN WE HAVE ANYTHING SO FRESH
SHE MIGHT TELL THAT LADY WHO HE WAS FIRST
THE CHIVALROUS MAN PAID THAT TAX WITH ALACRITY
AND THIS HAD THE IMMENSE MERIT FOR OLIVE THAT IT APPEARED TO MAKE HER BELONG TO THE PEOPLE THREW HER INTO THE SOCIAL DUSK OF THAT MYSTERIOUS DEMOCRACY WHICH MISS CHANCELLOR HELD THAT THE FORTUNATE CLASSES KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT AND WITH WHICH IN A FUTURE POSSIBLY VERY NEAR THEY WILL HAVE TO COUNT
SHE HAD ROAMED THROUGH CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SOUTH CARRYING THE BIBLE TO THE SLAVE
WHAT SHE HAD MAINLY SAID WAS THAT HE SOMETIMES TOOK HER TO THE THEATRE
WHEN SHE TALKED AND WISHED TO INSIST AND SHE WAS ALWAYS INSISTING SHE PUCKERED AND DISTORTED HER FACE WITH AN EFFORT TO EXPRESS THE INEXPRESSIBLE WHICH TURNED OUT AFTER ALL TO BE NOTHING
NEVERTHELESS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR STANDING ON THE ONLY SPOT IN CHARLES STREET WHICH HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM
I APPLY THAT ADJECTIVE TO HER FINE PLACID MASK BECAUSE SHE SEEMED TO FACE YOU WITH A QUESTION OF WHICH THE ANSWER WAS PREORDAINED TO ASK YOU HOW A COUNTENANCE COULD FAIL TO BE NOBLE OF WHICH THE MEASUREMENTS WERE SO CORRECT
HE ABOUNDED IN CONVERSATION TILL AT LAST HE TOOK UP HIS HAT IN EARNEST
THE CASUAL PATCHES OF ICE AND SNOW
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO PERSONAL AS MRS LUNA
BESIDES IT WAS A WOMAN'S QUESTION
AND WHEN AT LAST THE GLASS DOORS WERE DIVIDED THEY DISCLOSED A LITTLE OLD LADY
WHAT A POWER--WHAT A POWER MISS TARRANT YES I SUPPOSE IT IS A POWER
THAT'S THE WAY I FOUND HER WHEN I RETURNED FROM EUROPE HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE RANSOM ASKED
WAS SHE NOT COMING TO STIR THEM UP IN NEW YORK
NO DOUBT SHE WILL ACT ON ME THEN IT OCCURRED TO RANSOM TO ADD
A PERSON FROM MISSISSIPPI IS SURE TO BE ALL WRONG
WAS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK WHETHER HE COULD TELL HER AT LEAST IN WHAT MANNER SHE HAD OFFENDED HIM
WELL THERE WILL BE MORE INSPIRATION IF YOU DON'T TOUCH HER MATTHIAS PARDON SAID TO HIM
THE AIR WAS SILENT AND SHARP AND THE VAGUE SNOW LOOKED CRUEL
PUBLIC SPEAKING HAD BEEN A GREENSTREET TRADITION AND IF MRS TARRANT HAD BEEN ASKED WHETHER IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE HAD EVER SUPPOSED SHE SHOULD MARRY A MESMERIC HEALER SHE WOULD HAVE REPLIED
I HOPE IT ISN'T ME
AND OLIVE HAD WHILE IT LASTED A SENSE OF REAL HEROISM IN STEELING HERSELF AGAINST UNEASINESS
THESE HAD PREVAILED TO THEIR THINKING AT CAYUGA AND THEY NATURALLY FELT IT WAS NO USE FOR HIM TO SAY THAT HIS RESIDENCE THERE HAD BEEN FOR HIM--THE COMMUNITY STILL EXISTED BUT A MOMENTARY EPISODE INASMUCH AS THERE WAS LITTLE MORE TO BE URGED FOR THE SPIRITUAL PICNICS AND VEGETARIAN CAMP-MEETINGS IN WHICH THE DISCOUNTENANCED PAIR NOW SOUGHT CONSOLATION
AND YET THEIR MUSIC WAS NOT THEIR GREATEST JOY FOR THEY HAD TWO OTHERS WHICH THEY CULTIVATED AT LEAST AS ZEALOUSLY
THERE WERE OLD ONES ENOUGH IN THE FIELD
WHAT A NAME WELL HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE
AND OLIVE COULD SEE FROM THIS HOW FAR SHE WAS FROM FALLING IN WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID
DID YOU COME OUT ON WHEELS
IT SEEMED IMPLIED IN THE VERY PLACE THE BALD BARENESS OF TARRANT'S TEMPORARY LAIR A WOODEN COTTAGE WITH A ROUGH FRONT YARD A LITTLE NAKED PIAZZA WHICH SEEMED RATHER TO EXPOSE THAN TO PROTECT FACING UPON AN UNPAVED ROAD IN WHICH THE FOOTWAY WAS OVERLAID WITH A STRIP OF PLANKS
MRS LUNA WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING
I'M JUST A GIRL WHO WANTS TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR US
HER ROAD BRANCHED OFF TO THE RIGHT AND SHE HAD TO WAIT ON THE CORNER OF A STREET THERE BEING AS YET NO BLUE CAR WITHIN HAIL
BUT THE COMMONNESS OF HER OWN SURFACE WAS A NON-CONDUCTOR OF THE GIRL'S QUALITY
I HAVE NONE OF THAT SORT OF TALENT
YOU WILL ALWAYS CARRY YOUR GOODNESS FOR A MINUTE SHE MADE NO RESPONSE
OH YES SAID RANSOM SHE HAS JUST BEEN WITH ME BUT SHE HAS GONE DOWNSTAIRS WITH MISS TARRANT AND WHO IN THE WORLD IS MISS TARRANT RANSOM WAS SURPRISED THAT MRS LUNA SHOULD NOT KNOW OF THE INTIMACY OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IN SPITE OF THE BREVITY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BEING ALREADY SO GREAT
I CAN'T STAND A SLEIGH MYSELF
SHE HOVERED OVER THEM SMILING LISTENING DROPPING OCCASIONALLY A FANCIFUL THOUGH NEVER AN IDLE WORD LIKE SOME GENTLY ANIMATED IMAGE PLACED THERE FOR GOOD OMEN
SHE COULD NOT HAVE THAT ONE FOR THERE WAS A LIGHT IN MISS CHANCELLOR'S MAGNIFIED FACE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY THAT A SENTIMENT WITH HER MIGHT CONSUME ITS OBJECT MIGHT CONSUME MISS CHANCELLOR BUT WOULD NEVER CONSUME ITSELF
YOU WOULD FAR SURPASS ME IF YOU WOULD LET YOURSELF GO MISS CHANCELLOR SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A MELANCHOLY THAT WAS NOT DEVOID OF SWEETNESS
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING--OH I SHOULD LIKE SO TO SPEAK WE SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU MAKE A FEW REMARKS AT PRESENT MRS FARRINDER DECLARED WITH A PUNCTUALITY WHICH REVEALED THE FACULTY OF PRESIDING
AND THIS MADE HER LOOK WITH SUSPICION UPON ALL MALE ACQUAINTANCE
SO THAT HER FRIEND HAD A PERCEPTION AFTER THIS THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE IN ANY WAY EVER TO OFFEND HER
VERENA FLUSHED A LITTLE AT THIS APPEAL AND THE DEEPER GLOW OF HER EYES WAS THE FIRST SIGN OF EXALTATION SHE HAD OFFERED
SUCH STRANGE LIVES ARE LED IN AMERICA SHE ALWAYS KNEW THAT
OLIVE CHANCELLOR RECEIVED THIS APPEAL WITH PECULIAR FEELINGS
IT'S A PITY YOU CAN'T SYMPATHISE AS I TELL YOU PERHAPS MISS TARRANT WILL BRING ME ROUND
HE HAD INTAGLIOS AND SPANISH ALTAR-CLOTHS AND DRAWINGS BY THE OLD MASTERS
BUT IT HAD NONE THE LESS BEEN CONVEYED TO OLIVE BY THE VOICES OF THE AIR THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND A GOOD FELLOW
THIS MADE HER FEEL VERY SUPERIOR TRULY NOBLE
AND A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT MELANCHOLY EVENING I HAVE DESCRIBED WHICH RANSOM SPENT IN HIS GERMAN BEER-CELLAR BEFORE A SINGLE GLASS SOON EMPTIED STARING AT HIS FUTURE WITH AN UNREMUNERATED EYE HE FOUND THAT THE WORLD APPEARED TO HAVE NEED OF HIM YET
THERE WERE SOME THAT RECEIVED THE SENIORS AND JUNIORS
IT IS NOT OF THE SLIGHTEST IMPORTANCE HE MIGHT SAY THAT BUT IT WAS NOT TRUE
BUT I DON'T KNOW AS IT APPEALS TO ME--TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR IT
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE GOING ALREADY
AND MEANWHILE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GIRL'S FEELING ABOUT HERSELF IN HER SENSE OF HER IMPORTANCE TO MAKE IT A PAINFUL EFFORT FOR HER TO RUN THE RISK OF A MISTAKE
MOREOVER SHE DIDN'T LIKE ON ANY OCCASION TO BE SO PROMINENT
VERENA WONDERED AFTERWARD WHY SHE HAD NOT BEEN MORE AFRAID OF HER--WHY INDEED SHE HAD NOT TURNED AND SAVED HERSELF BY DARTING OUT OF THE ROOM
AND MATTHIAS PARDON REFLECTED AND ASSERTED WITH GLEE THAT THIS WOULD BE THE NEWEST THING YET
SHE WAS TREATED AS A BORE BUT SHE NEVER CARED
SHE FOUND A RESPONSE WHICH COMMITTED HER TO NEITHER VIEW
WOULD MISS CHANCELLOR BE WILLING TO DIVIDE A--THE--WELL HE MIGHT CALL IT THE RESPONSIBILITIES
I KNOW YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK SO MUCH--I'LL TRY TO SAY SOMETHING IF YOU WANT ME TO
THE PEOPLE HE HAD EVER SEEN WHO WERE MOST IN EARNEST WERE A COMMITTEE OF GENTLEMEN WHO HAD INVESTIGATED THE PHENOMENA OF THE MATERIALISATION OF SPIRITS SOME TEN YEARS BEFORE AND HAD BENT THE FIERCE LIGHT OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD UPON HIM
THAT THIS INCIDENT HAD REVEALED TO THE YOUNG MAN HIS IGNORANCE OF MANY THINGS--ONLY HOWEVER TO MAKE HIM SAY TO HIMSELF AFTER THE FIRST ANGRY BLUSH THAT HERE HE WOULD ENTER THE GAME AND HERE HE WOULD WIN IT--SO MUCH OLIVE CHANCELLOR COULD NOT KNOW
OH AS MANY AS YOU'LL LEAVE ME MATTHIAS PARDON ANSWERED WITH A LAUGH THAT CONTAINED ALL AND MORE THAN ALL THE JOCULARITY OF THE AMERICAN PRESS
SHE WOULD WALK RIGHT PAST MRS FARRINDER AND MRS FARRINDER KNEW IT
IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO REPRODUCE BY ANY COMBINATION OF CHARACTERS THIS CHARMING DIALECT
BUT IT WAS NOT IN THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S NATURE TO BE EITHER TIMID OR CAUTIOUS
THEN AFTER AN INSTANT HER MOTHER RISING PUSHED FORWARD WITH AN INTERESTING SIGH THE CHAIR ON WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SITTING
NEWTON TOOK AN INFANT OATH THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE A DESTRUCTIVE IMPIOUS RADICAL AND OLIVE FELT THAT AFTER THIS SHE NEEDN'T TROUBLE HERSELF ANY MORE ABOUT HER SISTER WHOM SHE SIMPLY COMMITTED TO HER FATE
HIS FRIENDS KNEW THAT IN SPITE OF HIS DELICACY AND HIS PRATTLE HE WAS WHAT THEY CALLED A LIVE MAN
HE DIDN'T SEE WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR
HE RESIGNED HIS TUTORSHIP AND DREW A LONG BREATH HAVING A VAGUE FEELING THAT HE HAD ESCAPED A DANGER
SO HE ONLY SMILED AT HER IN SILENCE AND SHE SMILED BACK AT HIM--A SMILE THAT SEEMED TO HIM QUITE FOR HIMSELF
THIS OF COURSE WOULD BE TO FLY BEFORE THE INEVITABLE PHASE MUCH MORE THAN TO FACE IT
NO SHE WAS ONLY SUPREMELY INNOCENT
BUT OLIVE DEEMED THAT BEING WHAT SHE WAS SHE HAD A RIGHT TO IMMENSE COMPENSATIONS
YOU MUSTN'T THINK SHE HASN'T A STRONG HOLD OF THEM HIS COMPANION EXCLAIMED MORE BRISKLY
SELAH TARRANT AND HIS COMPANION HAD STRANGE ADVENTURES
HE REMINDED HER THAT THEY HAD HAD ASHES SPRINKLED ON THE PLANKS ON PURPOSE
SHE HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK AND WHEN SHE SHOULD GO DOWN INTO THE GRAVE SHE WOULD LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND HER BUT HER GROTESQUE UNDISTINGUISHED PATHETIC LITTLE NAME
THERE WERE EXCELLENT PEOPLE NEAR HIM EVEN IF THEY WERE ARDENT REFORMERS
SHE HAD GIVEN HERSELF IN HER YOUNG AMUSED SURPRISE BECAUSE OLIVE'S STRONGER WILL AND THE INCISIVE PROCEEDINGS WITH WHICH SHE POINTED HER PURPOSE DREW HER ON
THEY WERE GARNISHED ON THE FIRST FLOOR WITH BALCONIES COVERED WITH SMALL TIN ROOFS STRIPED IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND WITH AN ELABORATE IRON LATTICE-WORK WHICH GAVE THEM A REPRESSIVE CAGE-LIKE APPEARANCE AND CAUSED THEM SLIGHTLY TO RESEMBLE THE LITTLE BOXES FOR PEEPING UNSEEN INTO THE STREET WHICH ARE A FEATURE OF ORIENTAL TOWNS
OLIVE TURNED IT OVER A MOMENT
AND ALSO A PLEASED PERCEPTION NOT THAT SHE WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THESE FRESH LIVES WHICH BEGAN WITH MORE ADVANTAGES THAN HERS BUT THAT SHE WAS IN SOME DEGREE AN ENCOURAGEMENT AS SHE HELPED THEM TO MEASURE THE WAY THE NEW TRUTHS HAD ADVANCED--BEING ABLE TO TELL THEM OF SUCH A DIFFERENT STATE OF THINGS WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG LADY THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY TALENTED TEACHER INDEED HER MOTHER HAD BEEN A TEACHER TOO DOWN IN CONNECTICUT
HE HAD A SORT OF ENAMEL OF GOOD HUMOUR WHICH SHOWED THAT HIS INDELICACY WAS HIS PROFESSION
YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE A RENDEZVOUS OF WITCHES ON THE BROCKEN WELL SO IT IS
I CAME WITH MISS CHANCELLOR WHO IS A KIND OF RELATION OF MINE AND YOU WERE VERY GOOD TO ME WHAT DID I DO ASKED MISS BIRDSEYE CANDIDLY
YOU ONLY STAY TO-MORROW
SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND SPIED OUT VERENA WHERE SHE SAT WITH HER MOTHER THE CENTRE OF A GRATIFIED GROUP
YOU SEE IF SHE DON'T HAVE QUITE A RUN AS FOR OUR MISSISSIPPIAN HE KEPT HIS AGREEABLE SENSATION FOR HIMSELF ONLY WONDERING WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT ASK MISS BIRDSEYE TO PRESENT HIM TO THE HEROINE OF THE EVENING
THERE WAS ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WITH RANSOM WHICH EMINENTLY BELONGED TO THE MAN
THERE WAS ALSO VERENA TARRANT OF COURSE
AND THE GAY VIBRATION OF HER VOICE AS SHE UTTERED THIS SIMPLE EJACULATION WAS THE LAST THAT RANSOM HEARD OF HER
IT'S A REGULAR DREAM-LIKE PLACE TO SIT
IF YOU READ A LADY'S LETTER YOU KNEW PRETTY WELL IN ADVANCE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND
THEY LOOKED OBLIQUELY AND SILENTLY AT MRS FARRINDER AND WERE PLAINLY UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT FORTUNATELY THEY WERE NOT THERE TO AMUSE THEMSELVES
A CHARLATAN OF THE POOR LEAN SHABBY SORT WITHOUT THE HUMOUR BRILLIANCY PRESTIGE WHICH SOMETIMES THROW A DRAPERY OVER SHALLOWNESS
SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH A KIND OF NEAR-SIGHTED DEPRECATION AND SEEMED TO HOPE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO GENERALISE IN ANY WAY OR SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME UP FOR ANY PURPOSE MORE SOCIAL THAN TO SEE WHAT MISS BIRDSEYE WANTED THIS TIME
RANSOM OF COURSE WAITED WITH HIS PHILANTHROPIC COMPANION THOUGH SHE NOW PROTESTED MORE VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THE IDEA THAT A GENTLEMAN FROM THE SOUTH SHOULD PRETEND TO TEACH AN OLD ABOLITIONIST THE MYSTERIES OF BOSTON
WAS IT POSSIBLE SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE KIND VERENA WAS OF AND WITH WHAT VULGAR ASPIRANTS TO NOTORIETY DID SHE CONFOUND HER
VERENA TOLD HER ABOUT THAT TOLD HER SO MUCH THAT IT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS IF SHE HAD TOLD HER ALL
I GUESS I KNOW MORE ABOUT WOMEN THAN SHE DOES AND THAT ISN'T YOUR OPINION I HOPE SAID RANSOM LAUGHING
BUT OLIVE DECIDED THAT IF THEY SHOULD REACH UNSCATHED THE TERM OF THEIR DELAY THE FIRST OF JULY SHE SHOULD HAVE FACED IT AS MUCH AS EITHER JUSTICE OR GENEROSITY DEMANDED
WELL NOW HE COULD ASSURE HER THAT THERE WAS NO PREPARATION SO GOOD AS JUST SEEING A COUPLE OF THOUSAND PEOPLE DOWN THERE BEFORE YOU WHO HAVE PAID THEIR MONEY TO HAVE YOU TELL THEM SOMETHING
AT ANY RATE NOW THAT THE OPERATIC SEASON HAD BEGUN HE WAS MUCH OCCUPIED IN INTERVIEWING THE PRINCIPAL SINGERS ONE OF WHOM HE DESCRIBED IN ONE OF THE LEADING JOURNALS OLIVE AT LEAST WAS SURE IT WAS ONLY HE WHO COULD WRITE LIKE THAT AS A DEAR LITTLE WOMAN WITH BABY DIMPLES AND KITTENISH MOVEMENTS THE TARRANTS WERE APPARENTLY GIVEN UP TO A MEASURE OF SENSUAL EASE WITH WHICH THEY HAD NOT HITHERTO BEEN FAMILIAR THANKS TO THE INCREASE OF INCOME THAT THEY DREW FROM THEIR ECCENTRIC PROTECTRESS
THOUGH HIS INDIFFERENCE TO OLD-FASHIONED STANDARDS HIS PERPETUAL INVOCATION OF THE BRIGHTER DAY HAD NOT YET LED HER TO ASK HERSELF WHETHER AFTER ALL MEN ARE MORE DISINTERESTED THAN WOMEN
THE PLACE WAS LIGHTED BY A SMALL HOT GLARE OF GAS WHICH MADE IT LOOK WHITE AND FEATURELESS
SHE HAD TAKEN NO PERCEPTIBLE LEAVE OF THE REST OF THE COMPANY
IT SEEMS AS IF I COULDN'T TAKE IT ALL IN
HIS SELECTIONS WERE ALL VERY HAPPY
IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MRS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT
OH YES--I WANT TO GIVE MY LIFE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A VIBRATING VOICE
I SHOULD LIKE SO TO STUDY IT
PRIVACY FOR BASIL RANSOM CONSISTED ENTIRELY IN WHAT HE CALLED LAYING OFF SHE WAS NOT SO PLAIN ON FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE AS SHE HAD SEEMED TO HIM AT FIRST
HE WAS PERHAPS NURSING HIS THUNDERBOLTS
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO WINTER THERE NOW OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF HER TWO RELATIVES ONE NEAR AND THE OTHER DISTANT BUT EACH SO LITTLE IN SYMPATHY WITH HER AND IT CAME OVER HER THAT THERE MIGHT BE A KIND OF PROTECTION FOR HER IN BINDING THEM TOGETHER ENTANGLING THEM WITH EACH OTHER
JUST YOU BE AS NICE TO HER AS YOU KNOW HOW MRS TARRANT HAD SAID TO HER
HE HAD NEVER ALLOWED THAT HE WASN'T STRAIGHT
MR BURRAGE AT ALL EVENTS HAD BEEN QUITE LOVELY AND HAD TALKED ABOUT HIS COLLECTIONS WHICH WERE WONDERFUL IN THE MOST INTERESTING MANNER
WAS A MERE TRAP AND LURE A BRIBE TO VANITY AND IMPATIENCE A DEVICE FOR MAKING HER GIVE HERSELF AWAY--LET ALONE FILL HIS POCKETS WHILE SHE DID SO
SEVERAL LADIES IMPATIENT OF VAIN DELAY HAD LEFT THEIR PLACES TO APPEAL PERSONALLY TO MRS FARRINDER WHO WAS PRESENTLY SURROUNDED WITH SYMPATHETIC REMONSTRANTS
I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK WE ARE NOT SO CORDIAL AS THEY ARE IN NEW YORK SHE DECIDED TO DRAW NEARER TO THE TRIO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM FOR SHE HAD PERCEIVED AS SHE DEVOUTLY HOPED MISS CHANCELLOR HAD NOT THAT VERENA WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PERSUADE EITHER OF HER COMPANIONS TO GO AND TALK TO HER DEAR FRIEND AND THAT THESE UNSCRUPULOUS YOUNG MEN AFTER A GLANCE OVER THEIR SHOULDER APPEARED TO PLEAD FOR REMISSION TO INTIMATE THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY HAD COME ROUND FOR
SHE SAID IT TOOK HER A LITTLE WHILE TO SEE INTO HER BUT NOW THAT SHE DID WELL SHE WAS PERFECTLY SPLENDID
BUT RANSOM COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS NOT AN ENTHUSIAST AND AFTER HIS CONTACT WITH HIS COUSIN'S ENTHUSIASM THIS WAS RATHER A RELIEF TO HIM
SHE COULD NOT HAVE LET HIM TOUCH HER
VERENA THOUGHT SUCH A VIEW LOVELY AND SHE WAS BY NO MEANS WITHOUT EXCUSE WHEN AS THE AFTERNOON CLOSED THE UGLY PICTURE WAS TINTED WITH A CLEAR COLD ROSINESS
SHE MUST BE USED TO ADMIRERS
HER REFUGEES HAD BEEN VERY PRECIOUS TO HER
IT REQUIRED AN EFFORT AT FIRST TO IMAGINE AN ARTIST SO UNTAUGHT SO MISTAUGHT SO POOR IN EXPERIENCE
AS THE DAUGHTER OF ABRAHAM GREENSTREET MRS TARRANT HAD PASSED HER YOUTH IN THE FIRST ABOLITIONIST CIRCLES AND SHE WAS AWARE HOW MUCH SUCH A PROSPECT WAS CLOUDED BY HER UNION WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ITINERANT VENDOR OF LEAD-PENCILS HE HAD CALLED AT MR GREENSTREET'S DOOR IN THE EXERCISE OF THIS FUNCTION HAD AFTERWARDS BEEN FOR A WHILE A MEMBER OF THE CELEBRATED CAYUGA COMMUNITY WHERE THERE WERE NO WIVES OR NO HUSBANDS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT MRS TARRANT COULD NEVER REMEMBER AND HAD STILL LATER THOUGH BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEALING FACULTY ACHIEVED DISTINCTION IN THE SPIRITUALISTIC WORLD
I MUST ADD HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR BEING HAPPY--OR AT ANY RATE REFLECTED THAT IT WAS A PITY SHE COULD NOT BE SO
HE WAS AN ENFANT DE LA BALLE AS THE FRENCH SAY
SHE HAD SEEN ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO LECTURES BUT THERE WERE HOURS WHEN SHE DESIRED FOR A CHANGE TO SEE SOME WHO DIDN'T GO
OLIVE HAD BEEN ACTIVE ENOUGH FOR YEARS IN THE CITY-MISSIONS
RANSOM COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER
PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY HE SPOKE
THE LADIES WHO WERE MUCH THE MORE NUMEROUS WORE THEIR BONNETS LIKE MISS CHANCELLOR
HER PARTY HER PERSON THE EXALTED ACCOUNT MISS CHANCELLOR GAVE OF HER HAD KEPT A VERY DISTINCT PLACE IN HIS MIND
IT WAS THE USUAL THINGS OF LIFE THAT FILLED HER WITH SILENT RAGE
YOU COULD CONTEST NEITHER THE MEASUREMENTS NOR THE NOBLENESS AND HAD TO FEEL THAT MRS FARRINDER IMPOSED HERSELF
IT HAD BEEN HER IMPRESSION AT ANY RATE THAT THEY HAD TALKED TOGETHER ABOUT VERENA'S SUDDEN BOUND INTO FAME
THEN THE DOCUMENT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE FOLDS OF HIS WATERPROOF AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS PUTTING IT INTO SOME QUEER PLACE ON HIS QUEER PERSON
HE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS PROMPTED BY THE INTENSE INTEREST HE FELT IN MISS VERENA
HER NERVES WERE CALMED HER PROBLEMS--FOR THE TIME--SUBSIDED
IF SHE WOULD FLING DOWN THE GLOVE ON THE TEMPERANCE QUESTION IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WOULD BE IN HIM TO PICK IT UP
WHEN HER GIFT WAS NOT IN EXERCISE SHE APPEARED ANYTHING BUT REFLECTIVE AND AS SHE SAT THERE NOW FOR INSTANCE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED THAT SHE HAD HAD A VIVID REVELATION
A CONTEMPLATION WHICH SHOWED HIM THAT SHE WAS AGITATED AND TRYING TO CONCEAL IT
WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO YOU
THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD HIS MOTHER VERY FASHIONABLE AND PROMINENT AND HE HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF A HANDSOME PATRIMONY
I'VE LIVED ON YOU
THE ADVENT OF THE NEW VISITORS MADE MRS TARRANT BUSTLE IMMENSELY
HE ONLY WANTED HER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF THREE OR FOUR EVENINGS A WEEK
BUT WE CAN'T PRETEND TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST TO START HER UP CAN WE SHE ASKED OF MR TARRANT WHO SAT THERE BESIDE HIS WIFE WITH A RATHER CONSCIOUS BUT BY NO MEANS COMPLACENT AIR OF ISOLATION FROM THE REST OF THE COMPANY
HE REGARDED THE MISSION OF MANKIND UPON EARTH AS A PERPETUAL EVOLUTION OF TELEGRAMS
WELL I ALWAYS LOOK FOR HER AND I ALWAYS FIND HER
IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD-STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
I SHALL REMEMBER THAT AND KEEP YOU UP TO IT SHE CRIED AFTER HIM AS HE WENT
AND IN SPITE OF HER FRIEND'S DISSUASION SHE DECLARED THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO PROMISE
THE DELIGHTFUL GIRL HE SAID TO HIMSELF
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER MRS LUNA THOUGH HE PRETENDED WITH HIS SOUTHERN CHIVALRY THAT HE HAD
NEVERTHELESS IT SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD NEVER SEEN AN INTERIOR THAT WAS SO MUCH AN INTERIOR AS THIS QUEER CORRIDOR-SHAPED DRAWING-ROOM OF HIS NEW-FOUND KINSWOMAN
SHE ASKED HIM IF SHE MIGHTN'T HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING HIM TO MRS FARRINDER
HE BROKE THE SILENCE ENSUING UPON MRS LUNA'S DEPARTURE BY ONE OF THE COURTEOUS SPEECHES TO WHICH BLIGHTED REGIONS MAY STILL ENCOURAGE A TENDENCY AND PRESENTLY FOUND HIMSELF TALKING COMFORTABLY ENOUGH WITH HIS HOSTESS
SHE WOULD HAVE DEEMED HERSELF VERY IMMORAL IF SHE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO CAPTURE FOR HER CHILD A RICH HUSBAND
FOR IF SHE HAD BEEN ALONE SHE WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED TO HER DESTINATION BY THE AID OF THE STREET-CAR
AND WHEN SHE SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE RESEMBLED SUCH THINGS HE HAD REPLIED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO PECULIAR AND SO DELICATE
BUT ALL THE SAME SHE LET VERENA RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN CHARLES STREET AND THE HORRIBLE HOLE THEY LIVED IN AND ADELINE KNEW FROM THAT GENTLEMAN WHO WROTE SO COPIOUSLY THAT THE GIRL NOW AND THEN SPENT A WEEK AT A TIME AT CAMBRIDGE
VERENA DIVERTED A MOMENT FROM HER COMMUNION WITH HER FRIEND CONSIDERED MR BURRAGE WITH A SMILE
WHEN MRS TARRANT BEGAN ON THE QUESTION OF CEREMONIES SHE WAS APT TO GO FAR
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAD ALWAYS A PRIMNESS
MRS LUNA LOOKED UP AT ALL THIS BUT SAW ONLY A PART OF IT
NOTHING FRIGHTENED HER
SHE THOUGHT MOST OF THEM PALTERERS AND BULLIES
IT'S QUITE LIKE DARBY AND JOAN
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN SHE SUSPECTED THAT SHE HAD LOST THE STRONG MORAL SENSE FOR WHICH THE GREENSTREETS WERE ALWAYS SO CELEBRATED
OH YOU DON'T KNOW
FOR THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT COME HAD BEEN HERS AND YET SHE SUDDENLY VEERED ROUND
SHE KNEW TOO LITTLE OF THE WORLD TO HAVE LEARNED TO MISTRUST SUDDEN ENTHUSIASMS AND IF SHE HAD HAD A SUSPICION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMON WORLDLY KNOWLEDGE THE WRONG ONE--THE SUSPICION THAT SUCH A WHIMSICAL LIKING WOULD BURN ITSELF OUT
SHE USED TO THINK THEY WERE SO MUCH IN SYMPATHY--HE EXPRESSED HER OWN IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING SO VIVIDLY
IF VERENA RECOGNISED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WAS NOT IN REPORT AS HER FATHER SAID WHEN JOCOSE YOUNG MEN RULED THE SCENE THE DISCOVERY IMPLIED NO GREAT PENETRATION
SHE HAD OPENED VERENA'S EYES TO EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES MADE THE GIRL BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD A HEAVENLY MISSION GIVEN HER AS WE HAVE SEEN QUITE A NEW MEASURE OF THE INTEREST OF LIFE
YOU KNOW IT BY IMAGINATION
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO MY OWN POOR GIFTS THIS DECLARATION APPEARED TO BE ADDRESSED TO MISS CHANCELLOR
WHEN RANSOM APPROACHED HER AND RAISING HIS HAT WITH A SMILE SAID SHALL I STOP THIS CAR FOR YOU MISS BIRDSEYE SHE ONLY LOOKED AT HIM MORE VAGUELY IN HER COMPLETE FAILURE TO SEIZE THE IDEA THAT THIS MIGHT BE SIMPLY FAME
SHE WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THINGS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT AND IF IT DIDN'T MEET HER VIEWS TO PAY A PUBLIC TRIBUTE TO VERENA THERE WASN'T ANY WAY KNOWN TO TARRANT'S INGENIOUS MIND OF GETTING ROUND HER
SHE SAW ALL THIS THROUGH THE BLUR OF HER SHYNESS THE CONSCIOUS ANXIOUS SILENCE TO WHICH SHE WAS SO MUCH OF THE TIME CONDEMNED
IN MRS TARRANT'S MEDITATIONS UPON THE GIRL'S FUTURE SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF A FINE MARRIAGE AS A REWARD OF EFFORT
NOT FORCED AND CRACKED AND RUINED
SHE ASSURED HIM THAT HE NEED HAVE NO FEAR ON THAT SCORE
MRS BURRAGE SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT EVERY ONE PRESENT HAD SOME DISTINCTION AND SOME TALENT THAT THEY WERE ALL GOOD COMPANY TOGETHER
MRS FARRINDER AT ALMOST ANY TIME HAD THE AIR OF BEING INTRODUCED BY A FEW REMARKS
THE THREE STOOD THERE TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LONG CHARACTERISTIC ROOM AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE OLIVE CHANCELLOR CHOSE NOT TO INTRODUCE TWO PERSONS WHO MET UNDER HER ROOF
TO KEEP IT TO RECOVER IT TO RECONSECRATE IT WAS THE AMBITION OF HER HEART
IT HAD BEEN HER PRINCIPAL INTEREST EVEN AS A CHILD HE MIGHT MENTION THAT AT THE AGE OF NINE SHE HAD CHRISTENED HER FAVOURITE DOLL ELIZA P
SHE REPLIED THAT IF THE NEWSPAPERS CHOSE TO INSULT HER THAT WAS THEIR OWN AFFAIR
SOME WEEKS LATER SHE EXPLAINED TO VERENA HOW DEFINITE THIS PREVISION HAD BEEN HOW IT HAD FILLED HER ALL DAY WITH A NERVOUS AGITATION SO VIOLENT AS TO BE PAINFUL
OH THERE IS NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO FOR THE LADIES
IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED THAT FOR THE MOST PART THEY ATTACHED TO THIS IDEA THE SAME MEANING AS SELAH TARRANT--A STATE OF INTIMACY WITH THE NEWSPAPERS THE CULTIVATION OF THE GREAT ARTS OF PUBLICITY
HE WOULD BE VERY SORRY INDEED TO ALLY HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF TARRANT
THEY ONLY HEARD THAT HE HAD TAKEN REFUGE UNDER THE RUFFLED MATERNAL WING
WHAT VERENA HAD MAINLY OBSERVED IN THE YOUNG LADY WHO CAME UP TO HER THAT WAY THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS THAT SHE WAS RATHER DOLEFULLY DRESSED THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN CRYING VERENA RECOGNISED THAT LOOK QUICKLY SHE HAD SEEN IT SO MUCH AND THAT SHE WAS IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY
AND THEY HAD ALSO A CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF GREAT QUESTIONS
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR EVENING IF YOU EXPECTED TO OBTAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO OUR IDEAS SAID MRS TARRANT WITH AN AIR OF IMPOTENT SYMPATHY TO MR GRACIE
SHE EXPECTED TO HAVE HER HANDS FULL WITH THE OTHERS WHO DIDN'T
THEIR COUSINSHIP--THAT OF CHANCELLORS AND RANSOMS--WAS NOT VERY CLOSE
SHE HAS GOT SO MANY OF HER OWN THAT I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE WOULD REQUIRE TO BORROW ANY
HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A DESIRE FOR PUBLIC LIFE
AND IT WAS IMPRESSED UPON HER IN TIME AS SHE THOUGHT THAT HER NEW FRIEND WOULD BE MORE SERIOUS EVEN THAN SHE ABOUT THE WOMAN-QUESTION SERIOUS AS SHE HAD HITHERTO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE
SHE WAS EVIDENTLY ACCUSTOMED TO TALK AND EVEN TO LISTEN IF NOT KEPT WAITING TOO LONG FOR DETAILS AND PARENTHESES
BUT OLIVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT IGNORE THE GESTURE
IT WAS NOT THAT VERENA HAD BEEN TAUGHT
IF IN CONVERSATION WITH HER YOU ATTEMPTED TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED OR TO JUMP TWO OR THREE STEPS AT A TIME SHE PAUSED LOOKING AT YOU WITH A COLD PATIENCE AS IF SHE KNEW THAT TRICK AND THEN WENT ON AT HER OWN MEASURED PACE
FOR THE PROPOSAL WAS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN MISS CHANCELLOR SEEMED ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
SHE PICTURED HER LABORIOUS CAREER HER EARLY ASSOCIATES ELIZA P
WELL SHE IS AN INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKER--THE MOST CHARMING CREATURE IN THE WORLD MRS LUNA PAUSED IN HER MANIPULATIONS GAVE AN AMAZED AMUSED STARE THEN CAUSED THE ROOM TO RING WITH HER LAUGHTER
MRS LUNA KNEW FURTHER BY HER CORRESPONDENT THAT VERENA HAD--OR HAD HAD THE WINTER BEFORE--A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION FROM GENTLEMEN
THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT THEY GIVE TO THEIR CLOTHING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID OF LOOKING FRIVOLOUS II WHETHER MUCH OR LITTLE CONSIDERATION HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THE RESULT MISS CHANCELLOR CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE INCURRED THIS REPROACH
HE COULD ONLY SEE THAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE GENTLENESS AND GOODNESS OF WOMEN AND HOW DURING THE LONG AGES OF HISTORY THEY HAD BEEN TRAMPLED UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF MAN
HE STOOD ALMOST APPALLED FOR A MOMENT AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT SHE WOULD TAKE HER UP AND THE GIRL WOULD BE RUINED WOULD FORCE HER NOTE AND BECOME A SCREAMER
DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE UP SHE DEMANDED SMILING
IN HER OWN PERSON SHE APPEARED TO OLIVE AND VERENA A REPRESENTATIVE OF SUFFERING HUMANITY
SHE ASKED HIM WITH A CERTAIN LOFTY COLDNESS--HE DIDN'T MAKE HER SHY NOW A BIT--WHETHER HE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE POSITION OF WOMEN
MISS CHANCELLOR SWEPT HER OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE YOUNG MAN TO EXTRACT A RELISH FROM THE INEFFABLE IRONY WITH WHICH SHE UTTERED THE WORDS EVEN A WOMAN IT WAS TO BE SUPPOSED ON GENERAL GROUNDS THAT SHE WOULD REAPPEAR BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE GLANCE SHE GAVE HIM AS SHE TURNED HER BACK THAT WAS AN EARNEST OF THIS
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME TO SAY SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE IS OR NOT AND SHE WOULDN'T FOR THE WORLD EXPOSE HERSELF TO TELLING A FIB
I WAS ONCE AT YOUR HOUSE--ON A VERY INTERESTING OCCASION
MISS CHANCELLOR SYLLABLED HER ADDRESS AND MRS TARRANT CAME FORWARD SMILING
THEIR UNION IS SO CLOSE SHE WON'T WANT HER TO BE WOUNDED RANSOM SAID INGENIOUSLY
BUT NOT RAISED TO A SCREAM
OLIVE AND I DISAGREE SO MUCH WHILE YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BOY DON'T THE YOUNG MAN REMARKED
I HAVE ONLY GOT TO GIVE OUT MY FEELINGS AND HE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST
SHE LOOKED AT SUCH TIMES AS IF SHE WERE HESITATING GREATLY BETWEEN SEVERAL THINGS SHE MIGHT SAY ALL SO IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE
THE GIRL HERSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST INTERESTED PERSON IN THE WORLD IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN THE MOST RESIGNED
SHE WAS DOUBTLESS A VERY SUPERIOR BEING BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOO ROUGH WITH HIM TO TEMPT HIM FURTHER
THE REASON OF THIS BEING HE SUPPOSED THAT THE FEW ADDRESSES SHE HAD MADE HAD NOT BEEN LECTURES ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE TO WHICH TICKETS HAD BEEN SOLD BUT INCIDENTS OF ABRUPT OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN MULTITUDINOUS MEETINGS WHERE THERE HAD BEEN OTHER PERFORMERS BETTER KNOWN TO FAME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO AWAY
OF COURSE SHE LIKES BAD SHIPS--BOSTON STEAMERS--JUST AS SHE LIKES COMMON PEOPLE AND RED-HAIRED HOYDENS AND PREPOSTEROUS DOCTRINES RANSOM WAS SILENT A MOMENT
OH SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD MENTIONED THAT
HE HAD JUST DISMISSED THIS METHOD AS OF QUESTIONABLE TASTE WHEN HE HEARD THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPEN WITHIN THE DEEP EMBRASURE IN WHICH IN CHARLES STREET THE MAIN PORTALS ARE SET AND WHICH ARE PARTLY OCCUPIED BY A FLIGHT OF STEPS PROTECTED AT THE BOTTOM BY A SECOND DOOR WHOSE UPPER HALF IN EITHER WING CONSISTS OF A SHEET OF GLASS
NEITHER THOUGH HE HAD PASSED HIS EARLY YEARS AS THE SON OF A RICH MAN WAS HIS CONCEPTION OF MATERIAL COMFORT VERY DEFINITE
YOU SEEM TO ME VERY WONDERFUL
NOTHING HAPPENED TO DISSIPATE THE GOOD OMENS WITH WHICH HER PARTNERSHIP WITH VERENA TARRANT WAS AT PRESENT SURROUNDED
SHE REGARDS ME AS AN ENEMY IN THE CAMP WELL SHE IS VERY BRAVE PRECISELY
SHE SAYS MY SERENITY WHILE EXPOSED TO THE GAZE OF HUNDREDS IS IN ITSELF A QUALIFICATION
OLIVE TRIED TO BE GLAD THAT HER FRIEND HAD THE RICHNESS OF NATURE THAT MAKES A WOMAN GRACIOUS WITHOUT LATENT PURPOSES
DON'T COME OUT
HER BEING BORED BY MRS TARRANT'S ATTEMPTING TO POINT IT OUT IS PERHAPS A PROOF OF THAT
SHE LET HERSELF BE CODDLED NOW BY HER FRIENDS OF THE NEW GENERATION
BUT THERE IS EVER AN IMPERFECTION I SUPPOSE IN EVEN THE SWEETEST REVENGE
TO BECOME GREAT IN ORDER NOT TO BE OBSCURE AND POWERFUL IN ORDER NOT TO BE USELESS
I SPEAK OF TEN MINUTES BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH THE YOUNG MAN LOST ALL SENSE OF TIME
SHE STOOD THERE WITH A QUIET FACE SERIOUS AND SIGHTLESS
OLIVE THANKS TO THE PHILOSOPHIC CAST OF HER MIND WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF ILLUSTRATIONS OF LAWS
I HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD CONSCIENCE IN NOT CALLING UPON HER BUT I SHOULDN'T LIKE HER TO THINK THAT I ANNOUNCED MY SLIGHTING INTENTION ALL OVER THE TOWN
ALL WILL BE RIGHT SHE ADDED MORE CALMLY WITH GREAT SWEETNESS
ALSO THAT SHE WOULDN'T CONSIDER THAT HE PRESSED IN TOO MUCH
WHAT KIND OF MEETINGS DO YOU REFER TO
HE HAD PLENTY OF THOUGHTS BUT IT SEEMED AS IF HE COULDN'T FIT THEM INTO EACH OTHER
MRS FARRINDER HAD TAKEN IT RATHER DRYLY AND CERTAINLY IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE HER OWN STYLE OF ORATORY REMARKABLE AND COGENT AS THIS WAS
MRS BURRAGE HAD COME TO SPEND A FEW DAYS NEAR HER SON
I WON'T REFUTE YOU
VERENA LIKED IT FOR THE MOST PART
IT WAS JUST AS SHE WAS THAT SHE LIKED HER
SHE SAYS I OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING GREAT AND SHE MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I SHOULD
SHE WISHED TO SEE MISS CHANCELLOR AGAIN AND TO SEE HER AMONG HER CHARMING APPURTENANCES WHICH VERENA HAD DESCRIBED TO HER WITH GREAT MINUTENESS
IN FACT HE WOULD NOT GROW UP AT ALL BUT ONLY GROW DOWN IF HIS MOTHER SHOULD CONTINUE HER INFATUATED SYSTEM WITH HIM
THIS NARRATIVE TREMENDOUSLY FASCINATING TO MISS CHANCELLOR MADE HER FEEL IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS--PROMPTED HER TO ASK HERSELF WHETHER THE GIRL WAS ALSO DESTITUTE OF THE PERCEPTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG
HOW COULD A MISSISSIPPIAN AGREE
RANSOM SECRETLY WISHED THAT HIS COUSIN--SINCE FATE WAS TO RESERVE FOR HIM A COUSIN IN BOSTON--HAD BEEN MORE LIKE THAT
MISS BIRDSEYE HESITATED A MOMENT IN ORDER TO MEASURE HER RESPONSE BY THE BOUNDS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
THEN NO DOUBT THEY WANTED TO STUDY UP THE WOMAN-QUESTION WITH THE FACILITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER
THERE'S PLENTY OF SYMPATHY WITHOUT MINE
BUT SHE CONFESSED TO POSSESSING A CERTAIN CAPITAL AND THE TONE SEEMED RICH AND DEEP IN WHICH MRS FARRINDER SAID TO HER THEN CONTRIBUTE THAT SHE WAS SO GOOD AS TO DEVELOP THIS IDEA AND HER PICTURE OF THE PART MISS CHANCELLOR MIGHT PLAY BY MAKING LIBERAL DONATIONS TO A FUND FOR THE DIFFUSION AMONG THE WOMEN OF AMERICA OF A MORE ADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THEIR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RIGHTS--A FUND HER ADVISER HAD HERSELF LATELY INAUGURATED--THIS BOLD RAPID SKETCH HAD THE VIVIDNESS WHICH CHARACTERISED THE SPEAKER'S MOST SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC EFFORTS
OF COURSE ONE MUST GIVE HER TIME BUT HE HAD SUPPOSED MISS CHANCELLOR WAS GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH FASTER
YOU'LL HAVE ME IN NEW YORK--YOU DON'T WANT ANY ONE ELSE MRS LUNA EJACULATED COQUETTISHLY
AS WE KNOW SHE HAD FORBIDDEN HERSELF THIS EMOTION AS REGARDS INDIVIDUALS
XI I WAS CERTAIN YOU WOULD COME--I HAVE FELT IT ALL DAY--SOMETHING TOLD ME IT WAS WITH THESE WORDS THAT OLIVE CHANCELLOR GREETED HER YOUNG VISITOR COMING TO HER QUICKLY FROM THE WINDOW WHERE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HER ARRIVAL
NO I DON'T WANT YOU TO CONCEAL ANYTHING
YOU TALK ABOUT TAKING HER AS IF YOU WERE A LECTURE-AGENT
WELL I KNOW YOU ARE SOME ONE
BLOOD BLOOD--THE WORLD IS DRENCHED WITH BLOOD
I AM NOT SO SURE SOME OF THEM CARE SO MUCH--ARE SUPPOSED TO CARE TOO MUCH--FOR US VERENA SAID WITH A SMILE THAT LOOKED DIM IN THE DARKNESS
AND THEN THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN CONCLUDED AS THEY HAD CONCLUDED BEFORE BY FINDING THEMSELVES COMPLETELY INSPIRINGLY IN AGREEMENT FULL OF THE PURPOSE TO LIVE INDEED AND WITH HIGH SUCCESS
THESE LADIES WERE EASILY DISPOSED OF BETWEEN THE TWO AND THE PUBLIC CRIMES OF BLOODY MARY THE PRIVATE MISDEMEANOURS OF FAUSTINA WIFE OF THE PURE MARCUS AURELIUS WERE VERY SATISFACTORILY CLASSIFIED
VII SHE HAD NO SOONER LEFT HIM THAN OLIVE CHANCELLOR CAME TOWARDS HIM WITH EYES THAT SEEMED TO SAY I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU ARE HERE NOW OR NOT--I'M ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT HER LIPS SAID WAS MUCH MORE GRACIOUS
MANY OF THEM WENT ABOUT WITH SATCHELS AND RETICULES FOR WHICH THEY WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR PLACES OF DEPOSIT
ON THIS OCCASION HE MOUNTED WITH RATHER A HEAVY TREAD TO HIS ROOMS WHERE ON THE RICKETY WRITING-TABLE IN THE PARLOUR HE FOUND A NOTE FROM MRS LUNA
SHE KNEW BY THIS TIME I SCARCELY CAN TELL HOW SINCE VERENA COULD GIVE HER NO REPORT EXACTLY WHAT SORT OF A YOUTH MR BURRAGE WAS
THERE WERE TIMES INDEED WHEN EVERY ONE SEEMED TO HAVE IT EVERY ONE BUT MISS BIRDSEYE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT--SHE WAS AN ANTIQUE AND THE POOREST HUMBLEST PEOPLE
THERE WERE SO MANY THAT SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN DEAD FOR WANT OF IT
SHE GUESSED HE WAS QUITE IGNORANT OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SHE DIDN'T THINK HE OUGHT TO GO ROUND TAKING RESPONSIBILITIES
YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO TELL MISS CHANCELLOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU ARE YOU HIS REQUEST SEEMED STILL SOMETHING OF A SHOCK TO THE POOR OLD LADY'S CANDOUR
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING WE WILL WORK AT IT TOGETHER--WE WILL STUDY EVERYTHING OLIVE ALMOST PANTED
BUT YOUR SAFETY MUST NOT COME FROM YOUR HAVING TIED YOUR HANDS
SHE WANTED TO ENTER INTO HER LIFE
WE SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU IN OUR HOME BASIL RANSOM WHILE THE MOTHER SPOKE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE DAUGHTER WHO STOOD THERE SO NEAR HIM BUT HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING THAT WOULD DO
IF MISS CHANCELLOR WANTED TO ATTACH HER PERMANENTLY SHE OUGHT TO PUSH HER RIGHT FORWARD
WELL SHE SAID WITH THE TENDERNESS OF A LONG RETROSPECT I HAVE SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT SINCE I LAST LISTENED TO ELIZA P
HE WAS INTENSELY FAMILIAR--THAT IS HIS TYPE WAS
THERE WAS A GROUP EVEN THAT WAS ON THE BEST TERMS WITH THE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE STUDYING FOR THE UNITARIAN MINISTRY IN THAT QUEER LITTLE BARRACK AT THE END OF DIVINITY AVENUE
THEN OLIVE PERCEIVED HOW FATALLY WITHOUT VERENA'S TENDER NOTES HER CRUSADE WOULD LACK SWEETNESS WHAT THE CATHOLICS CALL UNCTION
THE DISAGREEABLE EDITOR WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIS BEING OUT OF DATE ONLY HE HAD GOT THE TIME WRONG
THAT WAS THE WORST OF COMING BACK
YOU'RE A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN--SHE TOLD ME ABOUT YOU AFTERWARDS
THE PROMPTNESS OF HER VISIT TO OLIVE CHANCELLOR HAD BEEN AN IDEA OF HER MOTHER'S AND VERENA LISTENED OPEN-EYED WHILE THIS LADY IN THE SECLUSION OF THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CAMBRIDGE WHILE SELAH TARRANT WAS OFF AS THEY SAID WITH HIS PATIENTS SKETCHED OUT A LINE OF CONDUCT FOR HER
SHE SAYS IT'S A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO A MOVEMENT TO BE PERSONIFIED IN A BRIGHT YOUNG FIGURE
SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE WORKED THAT INTO THE IDEA THAT THE FEMALE SEX WAS SUFFICIENT TO ITSELF
ALSO THAT SHE HOPED MISS BIRDSEYE IF IT WAS NOT ASKING TOO MUCH WOULD ACCOMPANY HER TO THE DOOR
HE WANTED TO HEAR SOME OF THE NEW TRUTHS
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER MISS CHANCELLOR KNEW HIM OR WHETHER HER CURIOSITY HAD PUSHED HER TO BOLDNESS
TO THIS VERENA OBJECTED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR HER TO EXPIRE AT ALL
HE WAS NOT MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN HE WENT ON
ANYHOW WHAT HE WANTED TO SHOW WAS THAT THERE WAS ROOM FOR MISS VERENA
SHE HAD INSTANTLY SEATED HERSELF AND WHILE MRS LUNA TALKED SHE KEPT HER EYES ON THE GROUND GLANCING EVEN LESS TOWARD BASIL RANSOM THAN TOWARD THAT WOMAN OF MANY WORDS
SHE WAS NOT CONTINUOUS BUT FREQUENT AS IT WERE AND YOU COULD SEE THAT SHE HATED EXPLANATIONS THOUGH IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM THEM
THE PLACE SEEMED THICK WITH THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OUT OF WHICH SHE WISHED TO LIFT VERENA
IT WAS AS IF SHE WISHED HIM TO SEE NOW HOW SHE TRIED
HE TOO HAD A PRIVATE VISION OF REFORM BUT THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF IT WAS TO REFORM THE REFORMERS
THIS GAVE RANSOM TIME TO RECOGNISE HER
IN FACT SHE DID BREAK LAST SUMMER
THE IMPRESSION SHE HAD MADE UPON HIM WAS DUE TO SOME ACCIDENT OF MOOD OR CIRCUMSTANCE
IT WAS ONE OF THE PRIME ARTICLES OF HER FAITH THAT THE WORLD OF FASHION WAS WICKED AND HOLLOW AND MOREOVER VERENA TOLD HER THAT MISS CHANCELLOR LOATHED AND DESPISED IT
OH NO INDEED SHE HOPED SHE WOULDN'T GIVE UP--AT LEAST NOT BEFORE SHE VERENA HAD HAD A CHANCE TO SEE
AND I DIDN'T FEEL THE WANT OF A VOTE TO-DAY AT ALL DID YOU VERENA INQUIRED ENDING AS SHE ALWAYS ENDED IN THESE FEW SPECULATIONS WITH AN APPEAL TO OLIVE
TO KILL EACH OTHER WITH ALL SORTS OF EXPENSIVE AND PERFECTED INSTRUMENTS THAT IS THE MOST BRILLIANT THING THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVENT
IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST CHANGE THE WORLD HAD SEEN
SHE WAS A PLAIN SPARE YOUNG WOMAN WITH SHORT HAIR AND AN EYE-GLASS
MRS TARRANT HAD CARRIED AWAY A SUPPLY WHICH WOULD LAST HER ALL WINTER
YET IT BAFFLED HER TO UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN PARENTS WERE SO TRASHY THIS NATURAL LAW SHOULD NOT BE SUSPENDED
I GUESS IF YOU ASK FOR DOCTOR TARRANT ANY ONE CAN TELL YOU SHE SAID
WE MUST WAIT--WE MUST WAIT
HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO PLEASANT TO HER MOTHER THAT SHE ALMOST ALWAYS WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
AND HE ACCORDINGLY BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT MAKE A LIVING BY HIS OPINIONS
SHE HAD NEVER INVITED HIM TO CALL UPON HER AND THE APPEARANCE OF A GENTLEMAN WHOSE DESIRE TO SEE HER WAS SO IRREPRESSIBLE AS TO DISPENSE WITH SUCH A PRELIMINARY WAS NOT IN HER CAREER AN ACCIDENT FREQUENT ENOUGH TO HAVE TAUGHT HER EQUANIMITY
SHE WISHED TO EXTRACT A CERTAINTY AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE WISHED TO DEPRECATE A PLEDGE AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO PUT VERENA INTO THE ENJOYMENT OF THAT FREEDOM WHICH WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR HER BY PREVENTING HER EXERCISING IT IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION
SHE HAS TO HAVE HER FATHER TO START HER UP
IT WAS FULL OF SCHOOL-GIRL PHRASES OF PATCHES OF REMEMBERED ELOQUENCE OF CHILDISH LAPSES OF LOGIC OF FLIGHTS OF FANCY WHICH MIGHT INDEED HAVE HAD SUCCESS AT TOPEKA
THE GESTURE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE MEANT TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF HER
HE HAD CONDENSED INTO SHORTHAND MANY OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WOMEN OF HIS TIME--SOME OF THESE DAUGHTERS OF FAME WERE VERY VOLUMINOUS--AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A REMARKABLY INSINUATING WAY OF WAITING UPON PRIME DONNE AND ACTRESSES THE MORNING AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL OR SOMETIMES THE VERY EVENING WHILE THEIR LUGGAGE WAS BEING BROUGHT UP
WHAT THEY WANTED WAS FOR WOMEN AND IT SHOULD BE BY WOMEN
HE POURED CONTUMELY ON THEIR PRIVATE LIFE ON THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE WITH THE BEST CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD
HE MIGHT EVEN ATTRACT HER MORE POWERFULLY--WHO COULD TELL
THIS WAS SO PRETTILY SAID THAT OLIVE COULD SCARCELY KEEP FROM KISSING HER
CONFESS YOU MEANT IT AS A KIND OF REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM_--A SATIRE ON MRS FARRINDER HE SPOKE IN A TONE OF THE FREEST PLEASANTRY WITH HIS FAMILIAR FRIENDLY SOUTHERN CADENCE
I SHOULDN'T CARE TO TELL THE OTHERS I AM GLAD YOU HAVE SOME TO FALL BACK UPON THE DAY I SHOULD GO RANSOM WENT ON
IT WAS WITH THESE WORDS SHE HANDED HIM THE LITTLE STRIP OF PAPER THAT MEANT SO MUCH FEELING AS SHE DID SO THAT SURELY MRS FARRINDER HERSELF COULD NOT BE LESS AMATEURISH THAN THAT
SEE HER AT HOME
SHE HAD TALKED THEM OVER WITH MISS BIRDSEYE OLIVE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING AFTER HER NOW AND GIVING HER THINGS--THE GOOD LADY APPEARED AT THIS PERIOD IN WONDERFUL CAPS AND SHAWLS--FOR SHE FELT SHE COULDN'T THANK HER ENOUGH AND EVEN DOCTOR PRANCE'S FELLOW-LODGER WHOSE ANIMOSITY TO FLOURISHING EVILS LIVED IN THE HAPPIEST THOUGH THE MOST ILLICIT UNION WITH THE MANIA FOR FINDING EXCUSES EVEN MISS BIRDSEYE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT IF YOU CAME TO EXAMINE HIS RECORD POOR SELAH DIDN'T AMOUNT TO SO VERY MUCH
IT WOULD ONLY BE PREFERENCES THAT I SHOULD FIND ALARMING
AND WHILE THEY WERE SO ENGAGED MRS TARRANT EXPLAINED TO HER WHO THEY WERE AND HOW ONE OF THEM THE SMALLER WHO WAS NOT QUITE SO SPRUCE HAD BROUGHT THE OTHER HIS PARTICULAR FRIEND TO INTRODUCE HIM
AND BASIL RANSOM REMEMBERING WHAT MISS PRANCE HAD TOLD HIM AND ENLIGHTENED BY HIS OBSERVATION IN NEW YORK OF SOME OF THE SOURCES FROM WHICH NEWSPAPERS ARE FED WAS IMMEDIATELY TOUCHED BY THE CONVICTION THAT HE PERCEIVED IN IT THE MATERIAL OF A PARAGRAPH
AND BEFORE THEY LEFT SHE WOULD INTRODUCE HIM TO MRS FARRINDER
SHE HAD INTERFERED BETWEEN WIVES AND HUSBANDS MAD WITH DRINK
TARRANT WAS VERY FOND OF ALTERNATIVES AND HE MENTIONED SEVERAL OTHERS
SHE HAD HEARD HE WAS INTENSELY BRIGHT BUT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME MISTAKE
HE TALKED VERY QUICKLY AND SOFTLY WITH WORDS AND EVEN SENTENCES IMPERFECTLY FORMED
IN THE MONTH OF MARCH VERENA TOLD HER THAT MR BURRAGE WAS OFFERING MATRIMONY--OFFERING IT WITH MUCH INSISTENCE BEGGING THAT SHE WOULD AT LEAST WAIT AND THINK OF IT BEFORE GIVING HIM A FINAL ANSWER
WHEREUPON THEY WERE CORRECTED BY OTHERS WHO REMINDED THEM THAT IT WASN'T HER_--SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT--SO HER TRIM DIDN'T MATTER
HE HAD GIVEN HER A CHANCE VAINLY TO START SOME TOPIC HERSELF
ENTSAGEN SOLLST DU SOLLST ENTSAGEN I DON'T KNOW GERMAN
WHILE ROUND HER NECK AND FALLING LOW UPON HER FLAT YOUNG CHEST SHE HAD A DOUBLE CHAIN OF AMBER BEADS
MISS BIRDSEYE RESTED HER DIM DRY SMILE UPON THE DAUGHTER WHO WAS NEW TO HER AND IT FLOATED BEFORE HER THAT SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE REMARKABLE AS A GENIUS
BY THIS TIME MRS FARRINDER WAS IN A CONDITION OF OVERHANGING GLOOM
SHE HAD HAD IN HER EYE--AND WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY EYE IT WAS!--NOT A PLEASURE BUT A DUTY
BUT THEN IT REQUIRED AN EFFORT ALSO TO IMAGINE PEOPLE LIKE THE OLD TARRANTS OR A LIFE SO FULL AS HER LIFE HAD BEEN OF UGLY THINGS
HE HAD NOW ANTICIPATED THIS PERIOD CONSIDERABLY AND IT SEEMED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT HE HAD TAKEN A BASE ADVANTAGE OF HER STOLEN A MARCH UPON HER PRIVACY
IT WAS TARRANT'S CONVICTION THAT IF MATTHIAS PARDON SHOULD SEEK VERENA IN MARRIAGE IT WOULD BE WITH A VIEW TO PRODUCING HER IN PUBLIC
BUT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME MISS CHANCELLOR HAD OBSERVED THAT THE POSSESSION OF NERVES WAS NOT BY ITSELF A REASON FOR EMBRACING THE NEW TRUTHS
BUT SHE THOUGHT IT PRUDENT NOT TO ATTEMPT TO CUT SHORT THE PHASE SHE ADOPTED THAT CLASSIFICATION PREMATURELY--AN IMPUTATION SHE SHOULD INCUR IF WITHOUT MORE DELAY SHE WERE TO SHUT DOWN AS VERENA SAID ON THE YOUNG CONNOISSEUR
AND YOUR SUBJECT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY THE PAST HISTORY THE PRESENT CONDITION AND THE FUTURE PROSPECTS OF OUR SEX OH WELL ST LOUIS--THAT'S SCARCELY THE SOUTH SAID ONE OF THE LADIES
HER HEART HAD BEGUN TO THROB WITH THE CONVICTION THAT IF HE CROSSED THAT THRESHOLD SOME HARM WOULD COME OF OF IT FOR HER
I HAVE PAID MY HALF-DOLLAR THE DOCTOR ADDED WITH A CERTAIN GRIMNESS
AND SHE GOT UP RATHER QUICKLY AS IF BY TAKING LEAVE SHE MIGHT GIVE A PROOF OF WHAT SHE MEANT
HE COULD FIND HIS WAY ALONE AND HE SEEMED TO WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO ONE ELSE
HE ONLY HAD A GENERAL SENSE THAT SUCH PLACES WERE NATIONAL NERVE-CENTRES AND THAT THE MORE ONE LOOKED IN THE MORE ONE WAS ON THE SPOT THE PENETRALIA OF THE DAILY PRESS WERE HOWEVER STILL MORE FASCINATING AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE LESS ACCESSIBLE THAT HERE HE FOUND BARRIERS IN HIS PATH ONLY ADDED TO THE ZEST OF FORCING AN ENTRANCE
IT SEEMS TO PASS INTO HER AND MR PARDON INDULGED IN A GESTURE INTENDED TO SIGNIFY THE PASSAGE
HE WAS LEANING THERE IN SOLITUDE UNACQUAINTED WITH OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MISS BIRDSEYE FELT TO BE COLLECTIVELY OF VALUE AND WHICH WERE REALLY OF COURSE WHAT STRANGERS CAME TO BOSTON FOR
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN A BOY SHE WOULD HAVE CUT SCHOOL TO TRY PRIVATE EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICS OR TO MAKE RESEARCHES IN NATURAL HISTORY
VERENA DON'T FAIL ME--DON'T FAIL ME OLIVE SPOKE LOW WITH A KIND OF PASSION
I WONDER WHETHER VERENA HADN'T BETTER HAND THE CAKE
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO ALLOW THAT ALL THAT IS RATHER DAZZLING--FOR I AM NOT NATURALLY CONCENTRATED LIKE YOU HE PROMISES YOU SUCCESS
YOU ARE EVERYWHERE YOU ARE EVERYTHING
HE WATCHED HIS SMOKE AND HE THOUGHT THOUGHT SO HARD THAT AT LAST HE APPEARED TO HIMSELF TO HAVE EXHAUSTED THE THINKABLE
THEY WERE TREATING HER AS A SHOW AS A SOCIAL RESOURCE AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN FROM THE COLLEGE WERE LAUGHING AT HER SHAMELESSLY
ONLY TOOK UP THE SUBJECT AGAIN AFTER ADELINE HAD LEFT THEM--THE SUBJECT OF COURSE WHICH WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THE SUBJECT OF WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TOGETHER FOR THEIR SUFFERING SEX
EVEN BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO GO OLIVE FELT THAT THEY WERE BOTH VERENA AND SHE QUITE DEMORALISED AND SHE ONLY SUMMONED ENERGY TO TAKE HER COMPANION AWAY WHEN SHE HEARD MRS BURRAGE PROPOSE TO HER TO COME AND SPEND A FORTNIGHT IN NEW YORK
SHE HAD A HORROR OF THE IDEA OF VERENA'S MARRYING MR BURRAGE AND YET SHE WAS ANGRY WHEN HIS MOTHER DEMEANED HERSELF AS IF THE LITTLE GIRL WITH RED HAIR WHOSE FRESHNESS SHE ENJOYED COULD NOT BE A SERIOUS DANGER
SHE HAD PLENTY OF SYMPATHY AND HE WAS SURE SHE WAS WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES
OLIVE PUT OUT HER HANDS TO HOLD HER AND AT THIS MOMENT ONE OF THE PORTIERES OF THE ROOM WAS PUSHED ASIDE WHILE A GENTLEMAN WAS USHERED IN BY MISS CHANCELLOR'S LITTLE PARLOUR-MAID
XIV WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO MEET HER MRS TARRANT SAID
SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT BUT SHE NEVER KNEW IT
THESE CONSIDERATIONS WERE NOT PRESENT TO HIM AS DEFINITELY AS I HAVE WRITTEN THEM HERE
SHE PLAYED IT WITH EXTRAORDINARY SIMPLICITY AND GRACE
SHE LOOKED AT THE MOMENT AS IF LIKE JOAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD VISITS FROM THE SAINTS
SO HAND IN HAND FOR SOME MOMENTS THESE TWO YOUNG WOMEN SAT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
IT MIGHT SERVE AS A REASON FOR HAVING BROUGHT HER UP
IT CAME OVER HIM WITH SOME FORCE THAT HIS OPINIONS WOULD NOT YIELD INTEREST AND THE EVAPORATION OF THIS PLEASING HYPOTHESIS MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MAN IN AN OPEN BOAT AT SEA WHO SHOULD JUST HAVE PARTED WITH HIS LAST RAG OF CANVAS
I WOULD FAR RATHER YOU DIDN'T
IT SEEMED TO EXPAND TO OPEN ITSELF TO THE GREAT LIFE OF HUMANITY
THIS MADE HIS COMPANION FEEL WITH INTENSITY HOW LITTLE SHE WAS JOKING
COULD ANYTHING IN EFFECT BE LESS UNDERHAND THAN SUCH AN INDIFFERENCE TO WHAT SHE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR CARRYING ON A FLIRTATION
MUST SHE GO MISS OLIVE HE ASKED OF HIS COUSIN
A LADY IN CAMBRIDGE HAD BEEN SO MUCH INDEBTED TO HIM THAT SHE HAD RECENTLY PERSUADED THEM TO TAKE A HOUSE NEAR HER IN ORDER THAT DOCTOR TARRANT MIGHT DROP IN AT ANY TIME
IN SYMPATHY WITH WHAT DEAR MADAM BASIL RANSOM ASKED FAILING STILL TO HER PERCEPTION TO CATCH THE TONE OF REAL SERIOUSNESS
ON THIS OCCASION IT SEEMED TO SHAPE ITSELF IN HER MIND
IT SEEMED TO MRS LUNA NOW THAT HE HAD EVERY DISTINCTION SHE HAD KNOWN HE HAD MOST THAT HE WAS REALLY A CHARMING MAN
SHE COULD HARDLY SAY WHAT IT HAD BEST BE AS YET
THESE WERE LARGER CONSEQUENCES THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF MEETING THE LEADERS OF SOCIETY AT OLIVE'S HOUSE
THE OTHER THAT SHE KNEW--ONLY SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM SHE SUPPOSED BASIL WOULD THINK THAT QUEER)--WAS THE TALL PALE GENTLEMAN WITH THE BLACK MOUSTACHE AND THE EYE-GLASS
HER MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN ILL FOR SOME WEEKS WANTED HER TO SLEEP THERE
AND IN A FEW DAYS THESE LADIES PAID A VISIT TO HIS APARTMENTS
THE COMPLAINT WAS IDLE INASMUCH AS IT WAS NOT PROBABLE HE COULD HAVE GONE TO BOSTON TO LISTEN TO HER
THAT NEWTON'S LITTLE NATURE WAS REMARKABLE HAD OFTEN BEEN INSISTED ON BY HIS MOTHER
SHE WAS AFRAID VERENA WOULD GIVE IN TO SOME MAN AND SHE WANTED TO MAKE A BREAK
WHEN I LIKE I LIKE TOO MUCH
HE WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT YOUNG INTERVIEWER ON THE BOSTON PRESS
HE HAD NOW COME IN REDEMPTION OF HIS GRATEFUL VOW AND EVEN THIS DID NOT MAKE MISS CHANCELLOR FEEL THAT SHE HAD COURTED DANGER
SHE NEITHER KNEW WHAT SHE SMELLED NOR TASTED WHAT SHE ATE
PERHAPS SHE WOULD SHOW THEM HER GIFT AS NO ONE SEEMED INCLINED TO DO ANYTHING
SHE HAD PROMISED TO STAY WITH HER FRIEND AS LONG AS HER FRIEND SHOULD REQUIRE IT
HE WAS ADDICTED WITH THE LADIES TO THE OLD FORMS OF ADDRESS AND OF GALLANTRY
HER NEW FRIEND SEEMED TO WISH TO KEEP HER QUITE FOR HERSELF
AND THE PROCESS HAD BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF VERENA INTO THE FOLD
RANSOM PERCEIVED THAT THE GARMENTS SUSPENDED TO THE HAT-RACK WERE NOT A SIGN THAT MISS BIRDSEYE'S FRIENDS HAD ASSEMBLED
BUT IF SHE WERE ONE IT WAS ALL THE MORE SHAME TO HER TO HAVE MATED WITH SUCH A VARLET RANSOM SAID TO HIMSELF MAKING USE AS HE DID GENERALLY OF TERMS OF OPPROBRIUM EXTRACTED FROM THE OLDER ENGLISH LITERATURE
HE HAD NEVER FELT HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MUCH ORGANISED PRIVACY OR OF SO MANY OBJECTS THAT SPOKE OF HABITS AND TASTES
THEY SCORN IT
WELL I SUPPOSE EVERY ONE MUST ACT OUT THEIR IDEAL
HE HAD TOLD MRS LUNA THAT HE SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO MAKE ANOTHER JOURNEY TO BOSTON
BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST SENSE OF THE SCENIC OR PLASTIC SIDE OF LIFE
DON'T LISTEN TO YOUNG MEN WHEN THEY TRY TO MOCK AND MUDDLE YOU
A VOICE A HUMAN VOICE IS WHAT WE WANT I'LL SPEAK AFTER YOU AND IF YOU'RE A HUMBUG I'LL EXPOSE YOU MRS FARRINDER SAID
IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD GET HER COMPANION OUT OF THE WAY--OUT OF THE WAY OF OFFICIOUS FELLOW-CITIZENS--TILL SHE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY FIRM ON HER FEET AND WOULD ALSO GIVE GREATER INTENSITY TO THEIR OWN LONG CONVERSATION
IT HAD NOW BEEN QUITE AGREED BETWEEN THEM THAT NO ARTIFICIAL LIMITS SHOULD BE SET TO THE FAMOUS PHASE
I WANT TO BE NEAR TO THEM--TO HELP THEM
SHE WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF EAGERNESS AND DOCILITY
IMAGES OF LEISURE PLAYED BEFORE HIM LEISURE IN WHICH HE SAW HIMSELF COVERING FOOLSCAP PAPER WITH HIS VIEWS ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS AND WITH FAVOURABLE ILLUSTRATIONS OF SOUTHERN ELOQUENCE
AND HE ASKED FOR REVELATIONS OF THE VIE INTIME OF HIS VICTIMS WITH THE BLAND CONFIDENCE OF A FASHIONABLE PHYSICIAN INQUIRING ABOUT SYMPTOMS
I CARRIED THEM THE BIBLE RANSOM WAS SILENT A MOMENT
THERE HAD BEEN PRIMNESSES PRUDERIES SMALL RESERVES WHICH ENDED BY STAYING HER PEN
SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION--A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY--OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
IMPRESSED TOO
BUT VISIBLY SHE WAS PUZZLED BY THIS UNFORESEEN EMBODIMENT OF GRATITUDE AND FLUENCY AND HER EYES WANDERED OVER THE GIRL WITH A CERTAIN RESERVE WHILE WITHIN THE DEPTH OF HER EMINENTLY PUBLIC MANNER SHE ASKED HERSELF WHETHER MISS TARRANT WERE A REMARKABLE YOUNG WOMAN OR ONLY A FORWARD MINX
IT'S TOO SWEET FOR THAT
ABRAHAM GREENSTREET WAS VERY WELL BUT ABRAHAM GREENSTREET WAS IN HIS GRAVE
NOR WAS SHE FREE TO REPORT SHE WAS CERTAINLY NOW LESS FRANK AT HOME AND MOREOVER THE SUSPICION WAS ONLY JUST BECOMING DISTINCT TO HER THAT OLIVE WOULD LIKE TO DETACH HER FROM HER PARENTS ALTOGETHER AND WAS THEREFORE NOT INTERESTED IN APPEARING TO CULTIVATE RELATIONS WITH THEM
DOES YOUR SCHEME OF WORK EXCLUDE ALL DISTRACTION ALL RECREATION THEN THE YOUNG MAN INQUIRED
I SHOULD BE SO GLAD AT ANY RATE TO EXCHANGE IDEAS WITH HIM OLIVE FELT A DEEP ALARM AT THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC DISPUTE BETWEEN THESE TWO VIGOROUS PEOPLE SHE HAD A PERCEPTION THAT RANSOM WOULD BE VIGOROUS NOT BECAUSE SHE DOUBTED OF THE HAPPY ISSUE BUT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF WOULD BE IN A FALSE POSITION AS HAVING BROUGHT THE OFFENSIVE YOUNG MAN AND SHE HAD A HORROR OF FALSE POSITIONS
AND THEN VERENA TOLD OLIVE--SHE COULD SEE IT WAS AFTER A LITTLE DELAY--THAT HE WANTED HER TO COME ROUND TO HIS PLACE AND SEE HIS TREASURES
WE WANT LABOURERS IN THAT FIELD THOUGH I KNOW TWO OR THREE LOVELY WOMEN--SWEET HOME-WOMEN_--MOVING IN CIRCLES THAT ARE FOR THE MOST PART CLOSED TO EVERY NEW VOICE WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP ON THE FIGHT
WELL I SEE HER VERY OFTEN AND WE TALK A GREAT DEAL
THAT WAS THE LAND OF READING HE LIKED
ANDREWS AND STODDARD AT THE ILLUSTRIOUS MEN OF ROME AT THE UNIVERSE IN GENERAL TO WHICH AS HE LAY ON HIS BACK ON THE CARPET HE PRESENTED A PAIR OF SINGULARLY ACTIVE LITTLE HEELS
THEY COULDN'T REACH OUT FOR IT AND TRY AND PUSH THEIR WAY
MRS LUNA'S AFFAIRS WERE IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES WHO HAD COMPLETE CARE OF THEM AND RANSOM INSTANTLY PERCEIVED THAT HIS FUNCTION WOULD BE SIMPLY TO MEDDLE IN THINGS THAT DIDN'T CONCERN HIM
IT WAS HER THEORY THAT VERENA IN SPITE OF THE BLOOD OF THE GREENSTREETS AND AFTER ALL WHO WERE THEY WAS A FLOWER OF THE GREAT DEMOCRACY AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE HAD AN ORIGIN LESS DISTINGUISHED THAN TARRANT HIMSELF
SHE SAT DOWN NEAR MOST OF THEM IN TURN SAYING YES YES VAGUELY AND KINDLY TO REMARKS THEY MADE TO HER FEELING FOR THE PAPERS IN THE POCKETS OF HER LOOSENED BODICE RECOVERING HER CAP AND SACRIFICING HER SPECTACLES WONDERING MOST OF ALL WHAT HAD BEEN HER IDEA IN CONVOKING THESE PEOPLE
PERHAPS HE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH HER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM ALL
MRS LUNA FELT DOUBLY SORRY FOR HIM AS SHE PERCEIVED THAT HE DENIED HIMSELF THE LUXURY OF SYMPATHY THAT IS OF HERS AND THE VAGUE BUT COMPREHENSIVE SIGH THAT PASSED HER LIPS AS SHE TOOK UP HER CROCHET AGAIN WAS UNUSUALLY EXPRESSIVE OF HELPLESSNESS
SHE ONLY WANTS TO CALL ME OUT
HE WANTED TO SEE HER NAME IN THE BIGGEST KIND OF BILLS AND HER PORTRAIT IN THE WINDOWS OF THE STORES
AS HE WATCHED IT DANCE BEFORE HIM HE FELL INTO ANOTHER SILENCE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH MRS LUNA GAVE HIM ANOTHER MYSTIC SMILE
MATTHIAS PARDON STOOD IN THE APERTURE AND TARRANT AND HIS WIFE WITH THE TWO OTHER VISITORS APPEARED TO HAVE COME FORWARD AS WELL TO SEE WHAT DETAINED VERENA
SHE THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST OLIVE MUST BELIEVE IN HER
SHE HATED EUROPE BUT SHE COULD BE EUROPEAN IF IT WERE NECESSARY
AS SHE STOOD THERE DRAWING ON HER GLOVES--HER VISITOR HAD FORTIFIED HIMSELF AGAINST MRS FARRINDER BY ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE--SHE DECLARED TO HIM THAT SHE QUITE REPENTED OF HAVING PROPOSED TO HIM TO GO
HE DIDN'T TROUBLE HIMSELF MUCH TO ASK WHAT HAD SAVED HIM
IT WAS PORTENTOUSLY GRAVE THE EYES WERE ENLARGED THERE WAS A RED SPOT IN EACH OF THE CHEEKS AND AS DIRECTED TO HIM A QUICK PIERCING QUESTION A KIND OF LEAPING CHALLENGE IN THE WHOLE EXPRESSION
THE VERY STONES OF THE STREET--ALL THE DUMB THINGS OF NATURE--MIGHT FIND A VOICE TO TALK TO YOU
OLIVE CHANCELLOR WOULD HAVE RESTED HER CASE HAD IT BEEN NECESSARY ON THOSE GENERAL FACTS
HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH AN ODD MIXTURE OF ELEMENTS
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF MUCH BOHEMIANISM--HE DRANK BEER IN NEW YORK IN CELLARS KNEW NO LADIES AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH A VARIETY ACTRESS
ARE YOU NOT VISITING OH NO I AM NOT VISITING
THAT FATE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TO MARRY AN ENEMY OF HER COUNTRY A MAN WHO NO DOUBT DESIRED TO TREAT WOMEN WITH THE LASH AND MANACLES AS HE AND HIS PEOPLE HAD FORMERLY TREATED THE WRETCHED COLOURED RACE
SHE OUGHT TO BE CARRIED STRAIGHT AHEAD
XV TARRANT HOWEVER KEPT AN EYE IN THAT DIRECTION
IT'S SUCH A CHANCE TO SEE BOSTON IT ISN'T BOSTON--IT'S HUMANITY MISS CHANCELLOR AS SHE MADE THIS REMARK ROSE FROM HER CHAIR AND HER MOVEMENT SEEMED TO SAY THAT SHE CONSENTED
YOU COULD SCARCELY TELL WHICH THOUGHT MOST
BUT HE COULD HOLD HIS TONGUE IF THAT WERE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND HE USUALLY DID SO WHEN HIS PERPLEXITIES WERE GREATEST
THEY WOULD LAUGH ABOUT HER AS THEY WENT AWAY LIGHTING THEIR CIGARS AND FOR MANY DAYS AFTERWARDS THEIR DISCOURSE WOULD BE ENLIVENED WITH QUOTATIONS FROM THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS GIRL IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY WAYS MEN HAD OF BEING ANTIPATHETIC
BUT MR GRACIE AND MR BURRAGE HAD EXCITED HER SO THAT SHE WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE RATHER AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT
IT MAY PROBABLY BE SAID OF HER THAT SHE HAD TOUCHED BOTTOM
SO MUCH VERENA ONCE MANAGED TO ANNOUNCE
I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT SO MUCH OF EUROPE SO I DO
THERE WAS NEVER ANY KNOWING IN ADVANCE HOW MRS TARRANT WOULD TAKE A THING AND EVEN VERENA WHO FILIALLY WAS MUCH LESS ARGUMENTATIVE THAN IN HER CIVIC AND AS IT WERE PUBLIC CAPACITY HAD A PERCEPTION THAT HER MOTHER WAS QUEER
THERE WAS NOTHING AMBIGUOUS BY THE WAY ABOUT HER CONFEDERATE
SHE HAD SUFFERED BY THE LAWS HERSELF AT THE TIME HER FATHER DIED
OH HOW CAN I ASK YOU TO GIVE UP
VERENA'S GENIUS WAS A MYSTERY AND IT MIGHT REMAIN A MYSTERY
DO YOU WANT TO KEEP HER ALL TO YOURSELF OLIVE RESTED HER EYES FOR SOME MOMENTS UPON MRS LUNA WITHOUT SPEAKING
HER TALENT HAD MATURED AND NOW HE HAD NO HESITATION IN CALLING HER BRILLIANT
IT WAS A PART OF THIS WHIMSICALITY THAT MRS FARRINDER--THE READER MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP PACE WITH HER VARIATIONS--APPEARED NOW TO HAVE DECIDED TO UTTER A FEW OF HER THOUGHTS SO THAT HER HOSTESS COULD ELICIT A GENERAL RESPONSE TO THE REMARK THAT IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE BOTH THE OLD SCHOOL AND THE NEW
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS TOO MUCH HANGING BACK
IT'S NOT A LITTLE WAY
HE TOO UP TO THIS MOMENT HAD HOVERED IN THE BACKGROUND BUT HE NOW GENTLY CLOVE THE ASSEMBLY SEVERAL OF THE LADIES MADE WAY FOR HIM LEADING IN THE DAUGHTER OF THE MESMERIST
INDEED IT COMPLETED MISS BIRDSEYE HERSELF IF ANYTHING COULD BE SAID TO RENDER THAT OFFICE TO THIS ESSENTIALLY FORMLESS OLD WOMAN WHO HAD NO MORE OUTLINE THAN A BUNDLE OF HAY
HE WANTED NO ODDS
IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR--AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
HE GATHERED FROM WHAT MISS VERENA HAD TOLD HIM THAT SHE WANTED TO MAKE HER STUDY UP THE SUBJECT A WHILE LONGER--FOLLOW SOME KIND OF COURSE
HE TALKED TO THEM--WELL AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS SAYING
SHE EXPLAINED HER YOUNG FRIENDS TO EACH OTHER A TRIFLE INCOHERENTLY PERHAPS AND THEN WENT TO STIR UP MRS FARRINDER
IT WAS A RELIEF TO HIM WHEN VERENA GOT UP FROM HER CHAIR WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH MADE TARRANT DROP INTO THE BACKGROUND AS IF HIS PART WERE NOW OVER
THAT'S HER PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DON'T SLEEP YET RANSOM ASKED ALMOST TENDERLY
MOSELEY
MOSELEY
SHE TOLD HER THAT SUCH FOREBODINGS WERE A PECULIARITY OF HER ORGANISATION THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM THAT SHE HAD TO ACCEPT THEM
THE TRAGEDY WAS NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR HARM THAT MRS LUNA COULD DO HER FOR SHE DID HER GOOD RATHER THAT IS SHE DID HER HONOUR BY LAUGHING AT HER BUT IN THE SPECTACLE ITSELF THE DRAMA GUIDED BY THE HAND OF FATE OF WHICH THE SMALL IGNOBLE SCENES UNROLLED THEMSELVES SO LOGICALLY
SHE SAT WITH THEM AT THEIR TREMBLING VIGILS LISTENED FOR THE TREAD THE VOICE AT WHICH THEY GREW PALE AND SICK WALKED WITH THEM BY THE DARK WATERS THAT OFFERED TO WASH AWAY MISERY AND SHAME TOOK WITH THEM EVEN WHEN THE VISION GREW INTENSE THE LAST SHUDDERING LEAP
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A PARTY SINCE MISSISSIPPI SECEDED NO
AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT INDELICATE IN TAKING WARRANT FROM HER ORIGINAL INVITATION BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN HIM TO INFLICT ON HER A PRESENCE WHICH HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THE LAPSE OF TIME HAD MADE LESS OFFENSIVE
HE WAS ONLY PRETENDING HE DIDN'T
SHE COULD SEE BY THE WAY HE TALKED THAT HE WAS A CONSERVATIVE AND THIS WAS THE MOTTO INSCRIBED UPON HER OWN SILKEN BANNER
AND THEN THE SOUND REMAINED IN RANSOM'S EAR AS ONE OF THE STRANGEST HE HAD HEARD
WE MIGHT GO ROUND TOGETHER AS POISON AND ANTIDOTE!"--THIS MADE HIM FEEL THAT HE HAD CONVINCED HER FOR THE MOMENT QUITE AS MUCH AS IT WAS IMPORTANT HE SHOULD
SHE SEEMED TO BEGIN JUST TO-DAY AND SHE DEMANDED THEIR RIGHTS FOR THEM WHETHER THEY WERE UNHAPPY OR NOT
WE HAVE TRUSTED THEM TOO MUCH AND I THINK THE TIME HAS COME NOW FOR US TO JUDGE THEM AND SAY THAT BY KEEPING US OUT WE DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DONE SO WELL
THE TASTE OF LIQUOR BEING GOOD TO HIM AND HIS CONVICTION STRONG THAT CIVILISATION ITSELF WOULD BE IN DANGER IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE POWER OF A HERD OF VOCIFERATING WOMEN I AM BUT THE REPORTER OF HIS ANGRY FORMULAE TO PREVENT A GENTLEMAN FROM TAKING HIS GLASS
BUT SHE WAS NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH--SHE WAS TOO ABSTRACT
THE QUESTION APPEARED TO STRIKE THE YOUNG MAN AS ABRUPT AND IRRELEVANT TO COME DOWN ON HIM FROM A HEIGHT WITH WHICH HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HOLD INTERCOURSE
DIDN'T SHE KNOW WHAT A CARD THAT WOULD BE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WEIRD MEETINGS SHE WAS SO FOND OF
OLIVE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HANG THEM UP AS VENERABLE RELICS OF A PATIENT FIGHT AND THIS WAS WHAT SHE SEEMED TO DO WHEN SHE MADE THE POOR LADY RELATE HER BATTLES--NEVER GLORIOUS AND BRILLIANT BUT OBSCURE AND WASTEFULLY HEROIC--CALL BACK THE FIGURES OF HER COMPANIONS IN ARMS EXHIBIT HER MEDALS AND SCARS
SHE CONFESSED AS MUCH TO OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A SMILE WHICH ASKED THAT A TEMPORARY LAPSE OF PROMPTNESS MIGHT NOT BE TOO HARSHLY JUDGED
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY I DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT TRANSCRIPT WITH THE REPORT OF HER GREAT SPEECH
DO YOU REMEMBER A PARTY YOU GAVE A YEAR AGO LAST OCTOBER TO WHICH MISS CHANCELLOR CAME AND ANOTHER YOUNG LADY WHO MADE A WONDERFUL SPEECH OH YES
HE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE FORMERLY SUPPOSED HE WAS A MAN OF ABILITY THAT NOTHING PARTICULAR HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE HIM DOUBT IT THE EVIDENCE WAS ONLY NEGATIVE NOT POSITIVE AND THAT AT ANY RATE HE WAS YOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE ANOTHER TRY
SHE LIKED TO THINK THAT VERENA IN HER CHILDHOOD HAD KNOWN ALMOST THE EXTREMITY OF POVERTY AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FEROCITY IN THE JOY WITH WHICH SHE REFLECTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN MOMENTS WHEN THIS DELICATE CREATURE CAME NEAR IF THE PINCH HAD ONLY LASTED A LITTLE LONGER TO LITERALLY GOING WITHOUT FOOD
I SUPPOSE YOU'LL THINK WE GO A GOOD DEAL BY WHAT YOU SAY IN THIS HOUSE
HE PRODUCED OR WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PRODUCE THE IMPRESSION OF LOOKING ABOVE AND BEYOND EVERYTHING OF NOT CARING FOR THE IMMEDIATE OF RECKONING ONLY WITH THE LONG RUN
COULD REPEAT DAYS AFTERWARD PASSAGES THAT SHE APPEARED ONLY TO HAVE GLANCED AT
SHE WOULDN'T WANT TO LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF FOR HERSELF THE CONDITIONS WERE NOT FAVOURABLE
SHE WAS MISS TARRANT THE DAUGHTER OF THE HEALER
AND HE TURNED FROM IT BACK TO THE INTERIOR ILLUMINATED NOW BY A LAMP WHICH THE PARLOUR-MAID HAD PLACED ON A TABLE WHILE HE STOOD AT THE WINDOW AS TO SOMETHING STILL MORE GENIAL AND INTERESTING
WE ARE SUNK IN IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE AH MY PREJUDICES BURRAGE WENT ON
SHE WOULD BE ALMOST AS ANGRY AS IF SHE HAD LEARNT THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED MATTHIAS PARDON HAD NOT YET TAKEN HIS REVENGE IN THE NEWSPAPERS
IF THEY WERE NOT THEY WOULD JUST KEEP STILL AND LET OTHERS PRESS FORWARD WHO SEEMED TO BE CALLED
BUT OLIVE TRIED AFRESH TO ALLOW FOR SUCH ABERRATIONS AS A PHASE OF YOUTH AND SUBURBAN CULTURE
IT DEPENDS UPON THE TIME
SHE HAD NO EYEBROWS AND HER EYES SEEMED TO STARE LIKE THOSE OF A FIGURE OF WAX
SHE WAS ACCORDINGLY NOT SHOCKED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH ADVENTURES ON VERENA'S PART
SHE DIDN'T SEE WHY AS SHE SAID IT SHOULDN'T BE A PERMANENT STAND-BY FOR VERENA
THIS LITTLE DISCUSSION HAD BROUGHT THE BLOOD TO OLIVE'S FACE
THERE WAS A LEGEND THAT AN HUNGARIAN HAD ONCE POSSESSED HIMSELF OF HER AFFECTIONS AND HAD DISAPPEARED AFTER ROBBING HER OF EVERYTHING SHE POSSESSED
SHE HAD BEEN NURSED IN DARKENED ROOMS AND SUCKLED IN THE MIDST OF MANIFESTATIONS
THIS WAS WRITTEN SO INTENSELY IN HER DELICATE FACE THAT HE FELT AN UNFORMULATED PITY FOR HER BEFORE THEY HAD EXCHANGED TWENTY WORDS
WHETHER FOR A HUNGRY YOUNG MISSISSIPPIAN WITHOUT MEANS WITHOUT FRIENDS WANTING TOO IN THE HIGHEST ENERGY THE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT PERSONAL ARTS AND NATIONAL PRESTIGE THE GAME OF LIFE WAS TO BE WON IN NEW YORK
SHE WOULD STAY WITH OLIVE AS LONG AS IT SERVED HER PURPOSE BECAUSE OLIVE WITH HER GREAT RESPECTABILITY COULD PUSH HER AND COUNTERACT THE EFFECT OF HER LOW RELATIONS TO SAY NOTHING OF PAYING ALL HER EXPENSES AND TAKING HER THE TOUR OF EUROPE
IT MIGHT ALREADY BE SAID THERE WERE RECEIPTS FROM CHARLES STREET
HE SEEMED TO SEE HIMSELF TO FEEL HIMSELF IN THAT VERY CHAIR IN THE EVENINGS OF THE FUTURE READING SOME INDISPENSABLE BOOK IN THE STILL LAMP-LIGHT--MRS LUNA KNEW WHERE TO GET SUCH PRETTY MELLOWING SHADES
THEY WILL TRY TO STAMP IT OUT WHENEVER THEY CAN
WELL IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO HEAR YOU TWO TALK TOGETHER MRS TARRANT SAID TO HER
BUT YOU ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR THAT SO OLIVE RETURNED HER FRIEND'S COMPLIMENT
AT THIS PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT THE SCHOPPEN WERE VERY TALL AND THE BEER WAS VERY GOOD
HER DIGNITY REQUIRED ONE FOR SHE FELT THAT AT PRESENT THE ANTIQUE PRIDE OF THE GREENSTREETS WAS TERRIBLY AT THE MERCY OF HER CURIOSITY
OLIVE ASKED HER INNUMERABLE QUESTIONS
BUT SHE WAS ONLY VAGUELY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD AT HER SIDE THE SWEETEST FLOWER OF CHARACTER AS ONE MIGHT SAY THAT HAD EVER BLOOMED ON EARTH
MOREOVER SHE DID NOT SEAT HERSELF AGAIN IN HIS HONOUR
IN SPITE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGE OLIVE HAD LONG SINCE JUDGED HER AND MADE UP HER MIND THAT ADELINE LACKED EVERY QUALITY THAT A PERSON NEEDED TO BE INTERESTING IN HER EYES
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER MISS CHANCELLOR RECEIVED A VISIT FROM MATTHIAS PARDON WHO HAD COME TO ASK HER WHAT SHE MEANT TO DO ABOUT VERENA
WHEREUPON MRS LUNA ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT--DID HE MEAN AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION THAT HE WAS TOO POOR
I WANT TO ENTER INTO THE LIVES OF WOMEN WHO ARE LONELY WHO ARE PITEOUS
IF YOU BECOME DANGEROUS SOME DAY TO THEIR SELFISHNESS TO THEIR VESTED INTERESTS TO THEIR IMMORALITY--AS I PRAY HEAVEN EVERY DAY MY DEAR FRIEND THAT YOU MAY!--IT WILL BE A GRAND THING FOR ONE OF THEM IF HE CAN PERSUADE YOU THAT HE LOVES YOU
BUT THAT IS NO PROOF
HE KNEW OF COURSE THAT THERE WAS A PRESUMPTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SOCIABLE BUT NO PRESUMPTION HAD YET DETERRED HIM FROM PRESENTING A SURFACE WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE POLISHED TILL IT SHONE
THIS GENTLEMAN POINTED OUT THAT HIS DOCTRINES WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND THE AGE
HAD MISS CHANCELLOR NO FAITH IN HER GIRLHOOD
I WON'T LET YOU OFF
AND FROM BENEATH THE STIFF LITTLE PLAITS OF HER PETTICOAT A SMALL FAT FOOT PROTRUDED RESTING UPON A STILTED HEEL
CONVINCE ME OF WHAT SIR THAT WOMEN ARE SO SUPERIOR TO MEN OH DEARY ME SAID DOCTOR PRANCE WITH A LITTLE IMPATIENT SIGH
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK--THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NOBLE DONE WHEN ONE MAKES A SACRIFICE FOR A GREAT GOOD
THEN HE COUNTED THAT HER STRANGE SWEET CRUDE ABSURD ENCHANTING IMPROVISATION MUST HAVE LASTED HALF AN HOUR
IT WAS NOT A LINE IN WHICH IT WAS EASY TO APPEAR CONSPICUOUSLY DISINTERESTED
A CERTAIN GAIETY EVEN EXPRESSED IN A HIGHER PITCH OF CONVERSATION SEEMED TO FLOAT IN THE HEATED AIR
SHE MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF HER DISTINCTION THESE WORDS HE BOLDLY ADDRESSED TO THE GIRL WITH HIS MOST GALLANT SOUTHERN MANNER SAYING TO HIMSELF MEANWHILE THAT SHE WAS PRETTIER STILL BY DAYLIGHT
IT WAS TO FORM HER MIND SHE WENT
THE REST OFFERED SPACE FOR CERTAIN LATERAL DEMONSTRATIONS ON MISS BIRDSEYE'S PART
SUCH QUESTIONS WERE NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS THEIR BUSINESS WAS SIMPLY TO BE PROVIDED FOR PRACTISE THE DOMESTIC VIRTUES AND BE CHARMINGLY GRATEFUL AND THERE WAS TO HIS SENSE SOMETHING ALMOST INDECENT IN TALKING ABOUT THEM
NEVERTHELESS HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE MIGHT TURN AN HONEST PENNY BY GIVING AN HOUR OR TWO EVERY DAY TO THE EDUCATION OF HER LITTLE BOY
BUT OF COURSE IT'S ANOTHER THING YOUR LIKING ME OLIVE CHANCELLOR ADDED
MRS LUNA EXPLAINED TO HER SISTER THAT HER FREEDOM OF SPEECH WAS CAUSED BY HIS BEING A RELATION--THOUGH INDEED HE DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM
HER HEAD REMAINED AVERTED SHE BORED THE CARPET WITH HER CONSCIOUS EYES
SHE HAD BEGUN TO BELIEVE IN HERSELF TO A LIVELIER TUNE THAN SHE HAD EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE
THE DISTANCE WAS CONSIDERABLE AND MISS CHANCELLOR HAD ORDERED A HACKNEY-COACH IT BEING ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN CHARLES STREET THAT STABLES WERE NEAR
SHE HAD A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT WHEN GENIUS WAS ORIGINAL ITS TEMPER WAS HIGH AND ALL THIS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH DOCTOR PRANCE
MY GIFT SAID VERENA SMILING
SHE SHOULD ENJOY SO MUCH A LONG EVENING WITH HER ALONE WHEN SHE MIGHT ASK HER TEN THOUSAND QUESTIONS
WELL YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING IN YOUR HOLE MRS LUNA EXCLAIMED
SHE TOOK THE HAND THAT OLIVE PUT OUT TO HER
AND THIS LADY REPLIED WITH DIGNITY THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THE GIRL SPOKE SO WELL--SHE SPOKE IN SUCH A GOOD CAUSE
DID HE EVER HEAR OF THAT LITTLE PLACE
SHE MOVED AWAY FROM HIM BACKWARDS AS IF HE HAD GIVEN HER A PUSH
BASIL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS INTERMISSION TO ASK MISS BIRDSEYE IF SHE WOULD GIVE HIM THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF AN INTRODUCTION TO MISS VERENA
ONLY AN EXQUISITE CREATURE COULD HAVE RESISTED SUCH ASSOCIATIONS ONLY A GIRL WHO HAD SOME NATURAL LIGHT SOME DIVINE SPARK OF TASTE
AND AS THE WEEKS ELAPSED MISS CHANCELLOR SAW NO REASON TO REPENT OF HER TEMERITY
I OWE YOU I OWE EVERY ONE AN APOLOGY FOR MY RUDENESS AND FIERCENESS AT YOUR MOTHER'S
HE WAS SURE MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD BE SORRY TO PART WITH HER
RANSOM SAID TO HIMSELF THAT NOW PERHAPS WAS HIS CHANCE AND HE QUICKLY ACCOMPANIED MISS CHANCELLOR
FOR HER SCRUTINISING FRIEND VERENA HAD THE DISPOSITION OF THE ARTIST THE SPIRIT TO WHICH ALL CHARMING FORMS COME EASILY AND NATURALLY
HAD SHE NOT SAID THAT VERENA OFTEN WENT BACK THERE FOR VISITS OF SEVERAL DAYS--THAT HER MOTHER HAD BEEN ILL AND SHE GAVE HER MUCH CARE
HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS NOT REALLY STUDYING LAW AT ALL
SHE HAD PREACHED TEMPERANCE IN IRISH CIRCLES WHERE THE DOCTRINE WAS RECEIVED WITH MISSILES
IT WAS A MERCY FOR HER THAT SHE HAD NOT THAT ADDED IMMORALITY ON HER CONSCIENCE
SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY TO MRS FARRINDER WHEN THIS MOMENTARILY MISDIRECTED WOMAN STILL PREOCCUPIED WITH THE MILL-DAM RETURNED TO THE CHARGE
SHE'S SO NOBLE HERSELF THAT SHE MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE LESS SO
AT ALMOST ANY TIME FOR SHE ENVIED THEIR PREOCCUPATION SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE CHANCE WITH THEM
LATER HE SAW THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT LAUGHTER
WHY OLIVE YOU ARE QUITE A SPEAKER YOURSELF SHE EXCLAIMED
BUT SUCH A FEAR DIDN'T PREVENT HIM FROM HOLDING IT BECOMING IN A MAN OF TASTE TO GIVE THAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO LOW-BORN GIRLS WHO WERE PRETTY FOR ONE LOOKED OUT FOR THE SPECIAL CASES IN WHICH FOR REASONS EVEN THE LOWEST MIGHT HAVE REASONS THEY WOULDN'T RISE I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T MARRY HIM AND I WON'T VERENA SAID DELIGHTEDLY TO HER FRIEND
IT IS ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT REVOLUTIONISTS HAVE BEEN GOADED AND THE GOADING WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER DEFICIENT HERE WERE IT NOT FOR SUCH HAPPY ACCIDENTS IN VERENA'S PAST
HE COLLECTED BEAUTIFUL THINGS PICTURES AND ANTIQUES AND OBJECTS THAT HE SENT FOR TO EUROPE ON PURPOSE MANY OF WHICH WERE ARRANGED IN HIS ROOMS AT CAMBRIDGE
SHE WROTE TO OLIVE SHE WAS PERPETUALLY WRITING TO HER NOW BUT OLIVE NEVER ANSWERED THAT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HAVING FALLEN TO A LOWER PLANE BUT SHE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS A PROP TO HER WASTED SPIRIT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO CONVERSE WITH WHEN SELAH WAS OFF
BUT HE HAD TO REFLECT THAT THESE DOCTRINES WOULD PROBABLY NOT CONTRIBUTE ANY MORE TO HIS PROSPERITY IN MISSISSIPPI THAN IN NEW YORK
I AM ONLY A GIRL A SIMPLE AMERICAN GIRL AND OF COURSE I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LIFE THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE PAGE SEEMED TO FADE HOWEVER WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE TWO GIRLS HAD GONE FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME TO UNKNOWN LANDS
HE CAME WITHOUT MR GRACIE NOW
I AM AWARE OF THAT WITHOUT HER TELLING ME AND DON'T YOU SYMPATHISE WITH SUCH AN ASPIRATION WELL I DON'T KNOW AS I CULTIVATE THE SENTIMENTAL SIDE SAID DOCTOR PRANCE
SHE FELT THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW IT SHOULD GUESS IT ON THE SPOT
WHY SHOULD SHE BE SO INSINCERE
SINCE SELAH HAD ADDICTED HIMSELF TO THE MESMERIC MYSTERY THEIR HOME HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE WHAT THE HOME OF A GREENSTREET SHOULD BE
BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE UP THE DECLARATION
THIS CHECKED HIM
BUT MR GRACIE SAYS HE HASN'T LOOKED AT HER MORE THAN TWICE
BUT THEY WANTED TO TAKE IN EVERYTHING AND WHY SHOULDN'T MISS CHANCELLOR JUST MAKE THAT FIELD HER OWN
SHE HAD NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF THAT KIND IN HER LIFE BEFORE AND THAT THIS SUDDEN SUBTLETY SHOULD HAVE GLEAMED UPON HER AS A MOMENTARY TALISMAN GIVES THE MEASURE OF HER PRESENT NERVOUSNESS
AH MISS OLIVE ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE UP MRS FARRINDER AT THIS MISS OLIVE LOOKED AT HIM SHOWED HIM AN EXTRAORDINARY FACE A FACE HE SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD OR EVEN RECOGNISED
THERE NEVER HAD BEEN A MORE ATTRACTIVE FEMALE SPEAKER BEFORE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
MARTIN'S STREET LONDON 1921 FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1886 BOOK FIRST I OLIVE WILL COME DOWN IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES
IT MAY BE IMAGINED THEREFORE WITH WHAT EXULTATION AS TIME WENT ON MRS TARRANT FOUND HERSELF THE MOTHER OF AN INSPIRED MAIDEN A YOUNG LADY FROM WHOSE LIPS ELOQUENCE FLOWED IN STREAMS
THE ONLY THING ABOUT WHICH HE WAS PARTICULAR WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE SERVED UP HOT
TO BE A SHINING PROOF IN SHORT THAT THE FORUM FOR LADIES IS NOT NECESSARILY HOSTILE TO THE FIRESIDE
SHE WAS SQUEEZING FURTHER INTO THE CAR AND MAKING THE DISCOVERY THAT THIS TIME IT WAS FULL AND THERE WAS NO SEAT FOR HER
OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T SEE ONE IN THE SOUTH
THEN MEMORY OR INSPIRATION RETURNED TO HER AND PRESENTLY SHE WAS IN POSSESSION OF HER PART
WHILE THE POOR YOUNG MAN UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS DOOM REMARKED THAT HE HOPED SHE WASN'T GOING TO EXERCISE ANY INFLUENCE THAT WOULD PREVENT MISS TARRANT FROM TAKING THE RANK THAT BELONGED TO HER
AND PUTTING UP A HALF-GLOVED FAMILIAR HAND SHE DREW MISS BIRDSEYE DOWN TO HER AND THE PAIR EXPLAINED IN ALTERNATION WHAT IT WAS THEIR CHILD COULD DO
BUT THEY DO CALL IT--THEY DO CALL IT SHE MEDITATED AUDIBLY
THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO YOU EMINENTLY NATURAL THAT A DAUGHTER OF SELAH TARRANT AND HIS WIFE SHOULD BE AN INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKER YET AS YOU KNEW VERENA BETTER YOU WOULD HAVE WONDERED IMMENSELY HOW SHE CAME TO ISSUE FROM SUCH A PAIR
OLIVE CHANCELLOR DREW IN HER BREATH FOR AN INSTANT LIKE A CREATURE IN PAIN
ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MRS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
SHE HAD CERTAINLY SPOKEN WITH GREAT FACILITY TO CULTIVATED AND HIGH-MINDED AUDIENCES
HIS IDEAL OF BLISS WAS TO BE AS REGULARLY AND INDISPENSABLY A COMPONENT PART OF THE NEWSPAPER AS THE TITLE AND DATE OR THE LIST OF FIRES OR THE COLUMN OF WESTERN JOKES
THE GIRL WAS VERY PRETTY THOUGH SHE HAD RED HAIR
I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT SHE TRAVERSED MOST OF THIS PERIOD WITHOUT FURTHER SERIOUS ALARMS AND WITH A GREAT MANY LITTLE THRILLS OF BLISS AND HOPE
HIS FAM'LY WAS VERY RICH
I SHOULDN'T IF YOU WOULD COME AND LIVE WITH ME EVEN THIS REALLY PASSIONATE REJOINDER FAILED TO MAKE VERENA SHRINK
OTHERS THAT WERE ACCESSIBLE TO SOPHOMORES AND FRESHMEN
DID YOU COME HERE TO MEET HER--THE INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKER NO
HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY FAVOURED MEDIUM ONLY HE HAD HAD TO STOP FOR REASONS OF WHICH MRS TARRANT POSSESSED HER VERSION EVEN IN A SOCIETY MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE EFFACEMENT OF PREJUDICE THERE HAD BEEN CERTAIN DIM PRESUMPTIONS AGAINST THIS VERSATILE BEING WHO NATURALLY HAD NOT WANTED ARTS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH MISS GREENSTREET HER EYES LIKE HIS OWN BEING FIXED EXCLUSIVELY ON THE FUTURE
SHE HADN'T GOT HALF THE PROP'TY SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT IF THEY HAD BEEN DIFFERENT
IT ABSORBED HER LIKE A SOCIAL SWAMP
AS THEY PROCEEDED WITH THESE CONTEMPLATIVE UNDULATIONS MISS CHANCELLOR SAID TO HER COMPANION WITH A CONCENTRATED DESIRE TO DEFY HIM AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING THROWN HER SHE COULDN'T TELL WHY INTO SUCH A TREMOR
THIS DECISION AS TO WHETHER MR BURRAGE SHOULD BE RESPECTED ASSUMED IN THE LIFE OF THESE TWO REMARKABLE YOUNG WOMEN PITCHED IN SO HIGH A MORAL KEY THE PROPORTIONS OF A MOMENTOUS EVENT
IT HAD BEEN ENOUGH FOR MISS BIRDSEYE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID WHEN PRESSED SO FAR AS HER HOSTESS MUFFLED IN LAXITY COULD PRESS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GENERAL EXPECTATION THAT SHE COULD ONLY DELIVER HER MESSAGE TO AN AUDIENCE WHICH SHE FELT TO BE PARTIALLY HOSTILE
IT BECAME TOLERABLY VIVID TO HIM THAT IF EDITORS WOULDN'T PRINT ONE'S LUCUBRATIONS IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO FEEL THAT ONE WAS ABLE TO PUBLISH THEM AT ONE'S OWN EXPENSE
BUT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO MARRY HIM ALL THE SAME AND AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE REFLECTED THAT ONCE SHE CAME TO THINK OF IT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ANY ONE
SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CITY OF REFORM OH IT ISN'T THE CITY
HE PREFERRED NOT TO BROACH IT HIMSELF AND HE WAITED AWHILE FOR ANOTHER OPENING
AND ELIZA P
I SHALL WAKE UP FAMOUS IF I MARRY HIM
BUT THAT DID NOT MAKE THEM ANY LESS CYNICAL
FOR A YOUNG LADY HAD GLIDED INTO THE ROOM WHO STOPPED SHORT AS IT FELL UPON HER EARS
WELL SHE HAS GOT THAT
THE GREENSTREET TRADITION WOULD NOT PERISH AND THE DRY PLACES OF HER LIFE WOULD PERHAPS BE PLENTIFULLY WATERED
OH A GREAT MANY GENTLEMEN HAVE SPOKEN TO ME VERENA SAID
THEY MADE HIM NERVOUS THEY MADE HIM ANGRY AND IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS THAT HE ASKED HIMSELF WHEREIN THEY CONCERNED HIM AND WHETHER EVEN A CARPET-BAGGER HADN'T A RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE PLEASED WITH HIS DAUGHTER
OF COURSE--JUDGING BY WHAT HE HAD--HE APPEARED TO THINK YOU REQUIRED A GREAT MANY THINGS TO KEEP YOU UP
HE SMILED EVEN WHILE HE SUSPECTED THE MEANING OF THE LOOK MISS CHANCELLOR GAVE HIM
SO IT HAD COME TO PASS IN HER DISTENDED AND DEMORALISED CONSCIENCE THAT WITH ALL THE THINGS SHE DESPISED IN HER LIFE AND ALL THE THINGS SHE RATHER LIKED BETWEEN BEING WORN OUT WITH HER HUSBAND'S INABILITY TO EARN A LIVING AND A KIND OF TERROR OF HIS CONSISTENCY HE HAD A THEORY THAT THEY LIVED DELIGHTFULLY IT HAPPENED I SAY THAT THE ONLY VERY DEFINITE CRITICISM SHE MADE OF HIM TO-DAY WAS THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK
THIS BOLDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM THINKING THAT WOMEN WERE ESSENTIALLY INFERIOR TO MEN AND INFINITELY TIRESOME WHEN THEY DECLINED TO ACCEPT THE LOT WHICH MEN HAD MADE FOR THEM
THEIR ORGANISM WAS IN ITSELF A CHALLENGE TO SUFFERING AND MEN HAD PRACTISED UPON IT WITH AN IMPUDENCE THAT KNEW NO BOUNDS
I COULD ONLY SAY THREE WORDS--I COULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN MORE
HE STOOD THERE A MOMENT LOOKING AT THE LIGHT IN MISS BIRDSEYE'S WINDOWS AND GREATLY MINDED TO RE-ENTER THE HOUSE NOW HE MIGHT SPEAK TO THE GIRL
HE HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO SIT BY HER SIDE--HE WANTED TO SMOKE--THAT IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE VEHICLE HAD ROLLED OFF THAT HE REFLECTED UPON HER COOLNESS AND ASKED HIMSELF WHY THE DEUCE SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM AWAY
SHE LIKED TO SHINE AND SMILE AND TALK AND LISTEN
THERE WERE QUITE A NUMBER AT TOPEKA AND HER PHRASE LOST ITSELF IN HER LOOK AT OLIVE AS IF SHE WERE WONDERING WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HER
THERE ARE WAYS OF GETTING ON WITHOUT BUSINESS IF YOU WOULD ONLY TAKE THEM HE SELDOM ANSWERED HER NOTES AND HE DISLIKED EXTREMELY THE WAY IN WHICH IN SPITE OF HER LOVE OF FORM AND ORDER SHE ATTEMPTED TO CLAMBER IN AT THE WINDOW OF ONE'S HOUSE WHEN ONE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
SHE WAS AN ARTFUL LITTLE MINX AND CARED AS MUCH FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS SHE DID FOR THE PANAMA CANAL
SHE HAD AS MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE OF MARKING THE GULF THAT DIVIDED THEM
OLIVE CHANCELLOR SAT MOTIONLESS
AND THEN SHE ADDED GRAVELY I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GREAT YOU WILL YOU WILL WE BOTH WILL OLIVE CHANCELLOR CRIED IN RAPTURE
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT LIES BENEATH AND OUT OF SIGHT DON'T YOU KNOW
WHY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN OUR CAUSE OH IT WON'T DO--IT WON'T DO RANSOM WENT ON LAUGHING
HE SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS A GREAT PITY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM
FOAT DISCOURSE ON THE SUMMER-LAND CAME BACK TO HER WITH BITTERNESS
IN HER LARGE COUNTENANCE HER DIM LITTLE SMILE SCARCELY SHOWED
HE HAD NEVER MET ANY ONE SO MUCH IN EARNEST AS THIS DEFINITE LITERAL YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD TAKEN SUCH AN UNHOPED-FOR FANCY TO HIS DAUGHTER
OH YES
MATTHIAS HAD A MEAN OPINION OF TARRANT THOUGHT HIM QUITE SECOND-RATE A VOTARY OF PLAYED-OUT CAUSES
WELL IT IS A GIFT AND NO MISTAKE AND WELL THEY MAY CALL IT WHAT THEY PLEASE IT'S A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TO IT"--THESE GENIAL TRIBUTES FELL FROM THE LIPS OF A PAIR OF RUMINATING GENTLEMEN
SHE LET IT BE SEEN THAT SHE WAS STILL GOING
I RECKON SHE WILL SAID BASIL RANSOM GOOD-HUMOUREDLY
WELL I TRUST SHE MAY DEVELOP RICHLY AND THAT YOU MAY ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU DESIRE
SHE SAW WHEN ONCE SHE HAD LOOKED AT HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT THOSE WORLDLY INTERPRETATIONS ON THINGS WHICH WITH HER IT WAS BOTH AN IMPULSE AND A PRINCIPLE TO DEFY
AT MOMENTS SHE WAS FULL OF SUSPICION OF THE LADIES THEY WERE MAINLY LADIES WHOM SELAH MESMERISED
VERENA WAS PERFECTLY UNCONTAMINATED AND SHE WOULD NEVER BE TOUCHED BY EVIL
AND IF SHE HAD ONLY HAD A GOAT SHE WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED ESMERALDA THOUGH HE HAD BUT A VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF WHO ESMERALDA HAD BEEN
IT WOULD BE A VERY STUPID WORLD AFTER ALL IF WE ALWAYS KNEW WHAT WOMEN WERE GOING TO SAY VERENA WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE APPROACH OF THE CHARLES STREET CAR AS WELL AS OF THE FACT THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WAS IN PAIN
BUT SHE LINGERED LONG ENOUGH TO REMARK THAT SHE COULD SEE HE HAD THE OLD-FASHIONED IDEAS--HE REGARDED WOMAN AS THE TOY OF MAN
SHE KNEW OR SHE THOUGHT SHE KNEW ALL THE POSSIBLE TORTURES OF ANXIETY OF SUSPENSE AND DREAD
AND THERE WAS A SIMPLER IMPULSE
IT WILL COME MY GOOD CHILD IT WILL COME
YOU LADIES HAD BETTER LOOK OUT OR YOU'LL FREEZE TOGETHER VERENA WAS REMINDED BY HER MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD CATCH HER DEATH BUT SHE HAD ALREADY HEARD SHARPLY LOW AS THEY WERE SPOKEN FIVE LAST WORDS FROM OLIVE WHO NOW ABRUPTLY RELEASED HER AND PASSED SWIFTLY OVER THE PATH FROM THE PORCH TO HER WAITING CARRIAGE
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE YES VERY BASIL RANSOM REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND THE CURIOUS FEMININE SOFTNESS WITH WHICH SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN ENUNCIATE THAT ADVERB
THERE HAD TO BE SOME THINGS THEY WERE KNOWN NOT TO DO
VERY OFTEN WHEN SHE DESCRIBED THEM TO HER MOTHER MRS TARRANT DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE
IT'S SO INTERESTING TO ME TO HEAR WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT
SURELY HOWEVER HE SAID TO HIMSELF EVERY MAN IN THE PLACE WOULD OFFER HIS OWN TO SUCH AN INNOCENT OLD DEAR
IN WHAT NUMBERS WOULD THEY FLOCK TO OUR STANDARD
IF SHE WASN'T AFRAID OF FACING THE PUBLIC SHE WOULD GO FAR AHEAD OF ME
WHAT THE DEUCE DOES SHE WANT OF ME NOW IT WAS WITH THIS SOMEWHAT UNGRACIOUS EXCLAMATION THAT HE TOSSED AWAY HIS COUSIN ADELINE'S MISSIVE
WHY SHOULD OUR WOMAN'S HEARTS BE SO FULL OF IT AND ALL SO WASTED AND WITHERED WHILE ARMIES AND PRISONS AND HELPLESS MISERIES GROW GREATER ALL THE WHILE
PERHAPS THAT IS ONE OH NO
IT WAS THE ONE THING IN LIFE WHICH SHE FELT SHE HAD REALLY MASTERED
SHE WAS EAGER TO EXPLAIN THAT MR BURRAGE DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL TO WANT WHAT POOR MR PARDON HAD WANTED
WAS IT NOT ONE'S DUTY TO PUT ONE'S SELF IN THE BEST CONDITIONS FOR SUCH ACTION
SHE KNEW WHAT HER MOTHER WOULD HAVE DONE AND THAT HELPED HER DECISION
X VERENA TARRANT CAME IN THE VERY NEXT DAY FROM CAMBRIDGE TO CHARLES STREET
HE LEARNED FROM MRS LUNA THAT IT WAS NOT OLIVE WHO HAD SENT HER THE TRANSCRIPT AND IN LETTERS HAD ADDED SOME PRIVATE ACCOUNT OF THE DOINGS AT THE CONVENTION TO THE TESTIMONY OF THAT AMIABLE SHEET
RANSOM BROKE INTO A GENIAL LAUGH WHICH HE INSTANTLY SWALLOWED AGAIN AT THE SWEET GROTESQUENESS OF THIS VIRGINAL CREATURE'S STANDING UP BEFORE A COMPANY OF MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT LOVE THE NOTE ON WHICH SHE HAD CLOSED HER HARANGUE
AND A GENTLEMAN ADDED THAT HE GUESSED THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO HAD CONVERSED WITH ELIZA P
WELL I'VE GOT SOME WORK
NOW SHE STOOD THERE UP TO HER CHIN
SHE MINISTERED TO HEALTH AND SHE WAS HEALTHY HERSELF
SHE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE FOR PUBLIC MATTERS NOT FOR PEOPLE'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
THE WORST OF THE CASE WAS THAT VERENA WOULD BE SURE NOT TO PERCEIVE THIS OUTRAGE--NOT TO DISLIKE THEM IN CONSEQUENCE
YOU ARE MY CONSCIENCE I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE MY FORM--MY ENVELOPE
THIS YOUNG LADY'S WORST APPREHENSIONS WERE NOW JUSTIFIED BY MRS TARRANT'S CRYING TO HER THAT SHE MUST NOT GO AS MR BURRAGE AND MR GRACIE WERE TRYING TO PERSUADE VERENA TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SPECIMEN OF INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKING AND SHE WAS SURE HER DAUGHTER WOULD COMPLY IN A MOMENT IF MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD JUST TELL HER TO COMPOSE HERSELF
BUT HE NEVER SAW SO MUCH AS WHEN HE HAD HIS EYES FIXED ON THE CORNICE
WHAT VERENA WANTED WAS SOME ONE WHO WOULD KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HER HER FATHER HADN'T HANDLED ANYTHING EXCEPT THE HEALING UP TO THIS TIME WITH REAL SUCCESS AND PERHAPS MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD TAKE HOLD BETTER THAN SOME THAT MADE MORE OF A PROFESSION
SHE WAS REASSURED AT FINDING THAT HER VISITOR WAS PECULIAR
HE HADN'T GOT STARTED MUCH BY WHAT SHE COULD MAKE OUT AND SHE WAS EVEN AFRAID THAT HE DIDN'T DINE EVERY DAY
BUT THE BARENESS OF HER LONG LOOSE EMPTY PARLOUR IT WAS SHAPED EXACTLY LIKE MISS CHANCELLOR'S TOLD THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD ANY NEEDS BUT MORAL NEEDS AND THAT ALL HER HISTORY HAD BEEN THAT OF HER SYMPATHIES
MRS TARRANT SIGHED AND GRIMACED WRAPPED HERSELF MORE THAN EVER IN HER MANTLE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AS SHE WAS FIT TO STRUGGLE ALONE AND THAT HALF THE TIME IF VERENA WAS AWAY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE THE NERVE TO ANSWER THE DOOR-BELL
THE LONG PRACTICE OF PHILANTHROPY HAD NOT GIVEN ACCENT TO HER FEATURES
SHE WAS USED HOWEVER TO THESE PERPENDICULAR JOURNEYS AND THOUGH AS WE HAVE SEEN SHE WAS NOT INCLINED TO ACCEPT WITHOUT QUESTION THE SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OF HER TIME IT NEVER WOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO HER TO CRITICISE THE RAILWAYS OF HER NATIVE LAND
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE AND YOU'LL SEE OLIVE WAS SILENT A MOMENT
AND MRS TARRANT REPLIED THAT THEY LIVED AT CAMBRIDGE AND THAT THE HORSE-CARS PASSED JUST NEAR THEIR DOOR
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME AFTER ALL YOUR OPINION OF THE CAPACITY OF THE LADIES CAPACITY FOR WHAT SAID DOCTOR PRANCE
HAVE YOU GOT MONEY OLIVE WAS SO AGITATED FOR THE MOMENT WITH THE HOPE THAT THIS GREAT WOMAN WOULD APPROVE OF HER ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE THAT SHE TOOK NO TIME TO REFLECT THAT SOME OTHER QUALITY MIGHT IN COURTESY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED
THIS CUSHIONED FEMININE NEST MADE HIM FEEL UNHOUSED AND UNDERFED
SHE OUGHT TO REMAIN APART APART--_APART SAID MISS CHANCELLOR
THERE WERE FAMILIES THAT VIEWED SUCH A CUSTOM WITH DISFAVOUR
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T CARE YOU MUST SEE SO MANY
IT WAS HER PRACTICE TO SPEAK OF HER SISTER BY HER WHOLE NAME AND YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED FROM HER USUAL MANNER OF ALLUDING TO HER THAT OLIVE WAS MUCH THE OLDER INSTEAD OF HAVING BEEN BORN TEN YEARS LATER THAN ADELINE
SHE COULDN'T HELP IT
SHE SEEMS TO VIBRATE TO ECHO WITH EVERY WORD
IT WAS AS BAD AS SHE COULD HAVE DESIRED
HE KNEW THAT MISS CHANCELLOR APPRECIATED THE ADVANTAGE OF HER GIRLHOOD BECAUSE MISS VERENA HAD TOLD HIM SO
IT COMES BACK TO ME
AND THEN MISS BIRDSEYE ADDRESSED HERSELF TO THE COMPANY MORE AT LARGE WIDENING THE CIRCLE SO AS TO TAKE IN THE MOST SCATTERED GUESTS AND EVIDENTLY FEELING THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS A RELIEF THAT ONE HAPPENED TO HAVE AN OBSCURELY INSPIRED MAIDEN ON THE PREMISES WHEN GREATER CELEBRITIES HAD BETRAYED THE WHIMSICALITY OF GENIUS
I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS
THAT WAS THE HIGHEST PROOF MRS TARRANT COULD GIVE OF HER APPRECIATION OF A GENTLEMAN-CALLER THEY KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM BY THIS TIME
MOSELEY WHAT A PITY SHE ISN'T SPEAKING SOMEWHERE TO-NIGHT RANSOM EXCLAIMED
RANSOM OFFERED HIS HAND IN FAREWELL TO HIS HOSTESS
THE FRIENDSHIP OF A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN WAS ACCORDING TO THE PURE CODE OF NEW ENGLAND A COMMON SOCIAL TIE
EXCUSE MY STUPIDITY SHE ADDED
BESIDES WHICH A FIGURE IS NOTHING WITHOUT A SETTING AND OUR YOUNG MAN CAME AND WENT EVERY DAY WITH RATHER AN INDIFFERENT UNPERCEIVING STEP IT IS TRUE AMONG THE OBJECTS I HAVE BRIEFLY DESIGNATED
EVERY ONE HAS GOT SOME PROFESSION OVER HERE
I SHALL TAKE CARE TO ARRIVE THE DAY BEFORE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THIS SALLY RANSOM SAID ARE YOU NOT GOING ONE OF THESE DAYS TO BOSTON
SHE WISHED TO ARRIVE AT THIS
HER INTERIOR SHONE WITH SUPERFLUOUS FRICTION WITH PUNCTUALITY WITH WINTER ROSES
IT'S A NEW STYLE QUITE ORIGINAL HE ADDED
THE GIRL LOOKED AT HER WITH EXTRAORDINARY CANDOUR AND CONFIDENCE
THEY ONLY WANTED TO BE USEFUL
NOW YOU DON'T MEAN TO DENY THAT POWER THE POWER OF SETTING MEN IN MOTION
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER BEACON STREET MRS FARRINDER SUBJOINED
MISS CHANCELLOR DID NOT AGAIN ASK RANSOM TO BE SEATED
I THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERPRET HISTORY FOR YOU BY A NEW LIGHT WELL I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU IN MY HOME THESE WORDS HAD BARELY FALLEN FROM VERENA'S LIPS HER MOTHER TOLD HER THEY WERE IN GENERAL THE PROPER THING TO SAY WHEN PEOPLE EXPRESSED SUCH A DESIRE AS THAT
IT WAS NEVER HIS FAULT IF HIS LISTENERS FAILED TO THINK HIM IMPARTIAL
HE WAS A MESMERIC HEALER HE MADE MIRACULOUS CURES
SELAH HAD REAPPEARED BY THIS TIME
IT HAD ACQUIRED A SORT OF EXPOSED RETICENCE FROM THE HABIT OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A LECTURE-DESK OVER A SEA OF HEADS WHILE ITS DISTINGUISHED OWNER WAS EULOGISED BY A LEADING CITIZEN
A REAL LOVELY FRIENDSHIP WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD AS MRS TARRANT EXPRESSED IT PROP'TY WOULD OCCUPY AGREEABLY SUCH AN INTERVAL AS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE VERENA SHOULD MEET HER STERNER FATE
HE WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD CREATED SOME EXCITEMENT IN BOSTON BUT HE SHOULDN'T ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THAT TILL ONE BEGAN TO SEE HER PHOTOGRAPH IN THE STORES
SOMETHING HAD REVIVED IN HIM--AN OLD CURIOSITY AN IMAGE HALF EFFACED--WHEN HE LEARNED THAT SHE HAD COME BACK TO AMERICA
SHE HAD A TONE OF SOFTNESS AND SYMPATHY A GENTLE DIGNITY A SERENITY OF WISDOM WHICH SEALED THE APPRECIATION OF THOSE WHO KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO LIKE HER AND WHICH ALWAYS IMPRESSED VERENA AS SOMETHING ALMOST AUGUST
IT WAS BECAUSE THEY TOOK NO CREDIT--THEY FELT IT WAS A POWER OUTSIDE
SHE BELIEVED ON THE CONTRARY IN WONDERFUL TIMES SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE COMING
OLIVE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MRS FARRINDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
BASIL RANSOM WAS A YOUNG MAN OF FIRST-RATE INTELLIGENCE BUT CONSCIOUS OF THE NARROW RANGE AS YET OF HIS EXPERIENCE
WHY SHE KNOWS IT WITH SUPREME CERTAINTY
HE TOOK COPIOUS NOTES AND MEMORANDA AND THESE THINGS SOMETIMES SHAPED THEMSELVES IN A WAY THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY COMMEND THEM TO THE EDITORS OF PERIODICALS
I SUPPOSE HE WAS VERY CONCEITED FOR HE WAS MUCH ADDICTED TO JUDGING HIS AGE
IS IT SOMETHING TERRIBLE NEVER TO LISTEN TO ONE OF THEM NEVER TO BE BRIBED AT THIS MOMENT THE HOUSE-DOOR WAS OPENED AGAIN AND THE LIGHT OF THE HALL PROJECTED ITSELF ACROSS THE LITTLE PIAZZA
MISS BIRDSEYE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT LESSONS IN DRAWING ORDERS FOR PORTRAITS FOR POOR FOREIGN ARTISTS AS TO THE GREATNESS OF WHOSE TALENT SHE PLEDGED HERSELF WITHOUT RESERVE
NOBODY TELLS FIBS IN BOSTON
WHAT I MEAN IS--IS YOUR SYMPATHY A SYMPATHY WITH OUR SEX OR A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN MISS TARRANT WELL SYMPATHY IS JUST SYMPATHY--THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY
IT WAS OLIVE'S OPINION THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE GRACEFUL AND TOUCHING AND SHE SAW THAT THE IMPRESSION MADE WAS NOW DEEPER THAN ON THE FORMER EVENING
THEY HAD NOT BEEN THE PORTALS OF FASHION BUT IN THIS RESPECT SHE DEEMED THEY HAD EMULATED SUCH BULWARKS
IT CARRIED HER FAR AND SHE CAME OUT AT UNEXPECTED TIMES WITH HER RESULTS
BUT A TALENT FOR CONVERSATION
THEY MIGHT CARE FOR SUCH A POSITION OR NOT AS IT HAPPENED THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF IT BUT THERE THEY WERE AND IT MADE MRS FARRINDER SEEM PROVINCIAL THERE WAS SOMETHING PROVINCIAL AFTER ALL IN THE WAY SHE DID HER HAIR TOO NOT TO UNDERSTAND
THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE WITH LIFE YET AND THAT SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO ALLOW HER RESPONSIBILITIES TO CRUSH HER
THE SORT OF ARTICLE THEY PRODUCED WAS SOMETIMES MORE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PAPERS
OLIVE WISHED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HIM
IT CAME OVER HIM WHILE HE WAITED FOR HIS HOSTESS TO REAPPEAR THAT SHE WAS UNMARRIED AS WELL AS RICH THAT SHE WAS SOCIABLE HER LETTER ANSWERED FOR THAT AS WELL AS SINGLE
SHE SAID THAT OF COURSE SHE KNEW HOW GREAT HIS TALENTS WERE--HE COULD DO ANYTHING HE WANTED
THIS WAS DISCERNIBLE EVEN TO OLIVE'S VERY LIMITED SENSE OF HUMOUR
CERTAIN WORDS THAT CAME TO HIM HIS MISSISSIPPI PHRASES SEEMED PATRONISING AND PONDEROUS
WHY YOU DON'T IMAGINE THAT PURE VOICE IS TO BE HUSHED OH HUSHED NO
IT IS TOO LONG AGO YES I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT'S THE WAY YOU CHANGE ABOUT WOMEN
SHE MIGHT HAVE OFFENDED THE TASTE OF CERTAIN PEOPLE--RANSOM COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE WERE OTHER BOSTON CIRCLES IN WHICH SHE WOULD BE THOUGHT PERT
THESE AGREEABLE EFFECTS USED TO LIGHT UP THAT END OF THE DRAWING-ROOM AND OLIVE OFTEN SAT AT THE WINDOW WITH HER COMPANION BEFORE IT WAS TIME FOR THE LAMP
IN THE LAST RESORT THE WHOLE BURDEN OF THE HUMAN LOT CAME UPON THEM
SHE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTING TO BASIL RANSOM WHO IT IS TO BE FEARED HAD A FUND OF CYNICISM
YOU SEEM TO HAVE STARTED A KIND OF LECTURE OUT HERE MR PARDON SAID
BUT SHE HAD GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT THIS WAS ONE REASON WHY OLIVE HAD TAKEN HER ABROAD
THERE WAS NO STRUGGLE ABOUT THIS FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT BY THE TIME THE QUESTION CAME TO THE FRONT VERENA WAS COMPLETELY UNDER THE CHARM
BUT WHILE SHE LISTENED TO HIM MORE ABSTRACTEDLY THAN HER CUSTOM WAS SHE REMARKED TO HERSELF THAT THERE COULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN PROMISING OLIVE SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
IT WAS ONLY AN ADMONITION THAT THEY WERE NOT NEEDED AS LANDMARKS IN THE SAME PART OF THE FIELD
NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS VEXED THAT VERENA SHOULDN'T COME BACK TO HER WITH A LITTLE MORE OF THE FRAGRANCE OF BEACON STREET
IF HER ACCOUNT OF THEM WAS NOT VERY LUCID IT SHOULD BE SAID IN EXCUSE FOR HER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ANY IDEA OF VERENA TARRANT UNLESS ONE HAD HEARD HER AND THEREFORE STILL MORE IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE AN IDEA TO OTHERS
WAS IT AN AID TO SUCH A JUDGEMENT TO SEE THAT MRS BURRAGE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH BOSTON WITH HARVARD COLLEGE WITH HER SON'S INTERIOR WITH HER CUP OF TEA IT WAS OLD SEVRES WHICH WAS NOT HALF SO BAD AS SHE HAD EXPECTED WITH THE COMPANY HE HAD ASKED TO MEET HER THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR GENTLEMEN ONE OF WHOM WAS MR GRACIE AND LAST NOT LEAST WITH VERENA TARRANT WHOM SHE ADDRESSED AS A CELEBRITY KINDLY CLEVERLY BUT WITHOUT MATERNAL TENDERNESS OR ANYTHING TO MARK THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGE
YOU PRAISE THE GRACE OF YOUR SOUTHERN LADIES BUT YOU HAVE HAD TO COME NORTH TO SEE A HUMAN GAZELLE
HE MADE HER TALK ABOUT HER VIEWS FAR MORE THAN THAT GENTLEMAN BUT GAVE NO SIGN OF OFFERING HIMSELF EITHER AS A HUSBAND OR AS A LECTURE-AGENT
OLIVE CONSIDERED ALL THIS AS IT WAS HER EFFORT TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING FROM A VERY HIGH POINT OF VIEW AND ENDED BY FEELING SURE IT WAS NOT FOR THE SAKE OF ANY NERVOUS PERSONAL SECURITY THAT SHE DESIRED TO SEE HER TWO RELATIONS IN NEW YORK GET MIXED UP TOGETHER
HE HAD WISHED FOR GENERAL AS WELL AS FOR PARTICULAR NEWS OF VERENA TARRANT
TO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO OR THREE LITTLE POINTS IN WHICH SOCIETY HAS NOT BEEN QUITE JUST TO US
HE HAD A MOMENT OF ALMOST COMPLETE ILLUSION
BUT HE HAD LOWERED HIS TONE TO FRIENDLY PLEADING AND THE OFFENSIVE WORD WAS MITIGATED BY HIS SMILE
IN FACT SHE SEEMS TO THINK MY SERENITY IS QUITE GOD-GIVEN
IT WAS TINGED IN THIS CASE INDEED BY SUCH BITTERNESS AS MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO A YOUNG LADY WHO CULTIVATED THE BRIGHTNESS OF A GREAT FAITH
SHE WAS ALL OF ONE PIECE AND VERENA WAS OF MANY PIECES WHICH HAD WHERE THEY FITTED TOGETHER LITTLE CAPRICIOUS CHINKS THROUGH WHICH MOCKING INNER LIGHTS SEEMED SOMETIMES TO GLEAM
A SILENCE OF A FEW MOMENTS HAD FALLEN UPON THEIR TALK AND ADELINE--WHO DECIDEDLY HAD IMPROVED--APPEARED ALSO TO FEEL THE CHARM OF IT NOT TO WISH TO BREAK IT
BUT EXCEPT WHEN HER MOTHER MADE HER SLIGHTLY DIZZY BY A RESENTMENT OF SOME SLIGHT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD NEVER PERCEIVED OR A FLUTTER OVER SOME OPPORTUNITY THAT APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE PASSED WHILE MRS TARRANT WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO PUT ON VERENA HAD NO VIVID SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS ANY ONE ELSE FOR NO AUTHORITY APPEALING REALLY TO HER IMAGINATION HAD FIXED THE PLACE OF MESMERIC HEALERS IN THE SCALE OF FASHION
THIS ATTITUDE WAS SO UNBROKEN THAT IT MARKED A CRISIS--THE COMPLETE THE ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS PERSONAL SITUATION
I AM QUITE AS FOND OF YOU AS YOU ARE OF EACH OTHER MUCH HE KNOWS ABOUT THAT SAID VERENA WITH A SIDE-LONG SMILE AT OLIVE CHANCELLOR
VERENA'S INITIAL APPEARANCE IN BOSTON AS HE CALLED HER PERFORMANCE AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S HAD BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS
I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN
BEING AWARE THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CULTURE HIS DESIRE WAS SIMPLY TO SUPPLY HER WITH THE PABULUM THAT SHE WOULD EXPECT
SHE MURMURED SOME REQUEST THAT HE WOULD EXCUSE HER ABSENCE BUT HER SISTER INTERRUPTED HER WITH AN INQUIRY ABOUT MISS TARRANT
VERENA HAD TOLD HER FATHER THAT OLIVE HAD PUT HER VETO UPON THAT AND TARRANT HAD SAID TO THE YOUNG MEN THAT IT SEEMED AS IF MISS CHANCELLOR WAS GOING TO PUT THE THING THROUGH IN HER OWN WAY
VERENA LOOKED AT HIM WITH EYES THAT GREW LARGE
AND HE STOPPED WHILE HIS HANDS CONTINUED TO FUMBLE OUT OF SIGHT AND HE TREATED OLIVE TO HIS LARGE JOYLESS SMILE
TARRANT SPOKE AS IF AS A FAMILY THEY WERE PREPARED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM ON MODERATE TERMS
HE IS INTENSELY PLAIN BUT I BELIEVE HE IS VERY LEARNED
WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY MAKE IT WORSE COULD WE
AND SHE HAD THIS SIGN THE RAREST OF ALL OF GENEROSITY THAT SHE LIKED OBLIGATIONS OF GRATITUDE WHEN THEY WERE NOT LAID UPON HER BY MEN
THERE WAS IN FORGIVENESS A CERTAIN ARROGANCE OF WHICH SHE WAS INCAPABLE AND HER BRIGHT MILDNESS GLIDED OVER THE MANY TRAPS THAT LIFE SETS FOR OUR CONSISTENCY
THAT SHE WAS NOT A PROMPTER BUT POTENTIALLY AT LEAST A POPULAR FAVOURITE AND THAT THE WORK OVER WHICH MISS CHANCELLOR PRESIDED SO EFFICIENTLY WAS A GENERAL PREPARATION OF THE PLATFORM ON WHICH LATER HER COMPANION WOULD EXECUTE THE MOST STRIKING STEPS
SHE ACCEPTED THE IDEA THAT HER PARENTS SHOULD RECEIVE A PECUNIARY TRIBUTE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY FRIEND WHOM SHE HAD ENCOUNTERED ON THE THRESHOLD OF WOMANHOOD JUST AS SHE HERSELF ACCEPTED THAT FRIEND'S IRRESISTIBLE HOSPITALITY
THE ONLY ONE SHE HAD AS YET WAS THAT HE HAD RESPONDED TO HER LETTER--A COMPLAINT RATHER WANTING IN RICHNESS
BUT THE IDEA UTTERED AS HER FRIEND HAD UTTERED IT HAD A NEW SOLEMNITY AND THE EFFECT OF THAT QUICK VIOLENT COLLOQUY WAS TO MAKE HER NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT AS IF SHE HAD HAD A SUDDEN GLIMPSE OF FUTURITY
MRS TARRANT I MAY MENTION HAD A FURTHER MOTIVE
ANY SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF HER WOULD LIE VERY MUCH TO THE REAR OF THAT
SHE WAS SUBDUED AND CONSOLATORY SHE WAITED UPON HIM MOVED AWAY A SCREEN THAT INTERCEPTED THE FIRE REMARKED THAT HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND RANG FOR SOME TEA
THE GREATER THE PITY THAT HE COULDN'T CALL UPON VERENA HE CALLED HER BY HER NAME IN HIS THOUGHTS IT WAS SO PRETTY WITHOUT CALLING UPON OLIVE AND THAT OLIVE WAS SO DISAGREEABLE AS TO PLACE THAT EFFORT BEYOND HIS STRENGTH
VERENA WAS NOT FALLING IN LOVE
IT WAS NOW OLIVE'S OPINION THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T DESIRE IT
WE KNOW THAT HE THOUGHT THIS WAY VERY CIRCUITOUS
BUT HER FANCY WOULD MAKE A DART TO RIGHT OR LEFT WHEN OTHER GAME CROSSED THEIR PATH AND HER COMPANION LED HER INTELLECTUALLY A DANCE IN WHICH HER FEET--THAT IS HER HEAD--FAILED HER AT TIMES FOR WEARINESS
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SCOPE THAT EXCEEDED THE FIRST FLIGHT OF YOUR IMAGINATION
MISS BIRDSEYE'S VISITORS THOSE OF DOCTOR PRANCE AND OF OTHER TENANTS--FOR NUMBER 756 WAS THE COMMON RESIDENCE OF SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG WHOM THERE PREVAILED MUCH VAGUENESS OF BOUNDARY--USED TO LEAVE THINGS TO BE CALLED FOR
SHE IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MISS BIRDSEYE AND WHO IS MISS BIRDSEYE SHE IS ONE OF OUR CELEBRITIES
IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING FOR HER TO HAVE A PLACE TO RUN INTO WHEN SHE WANTED A CHANGE AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING BUT WHAT IT MIGHT END IN HER HAVING TWO HOMES
RANSOM COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AND HE FELT ON THE WHOLE RATHER INJURED
SHE SHOULD HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR A FREE EXPANSION
OH TO-NIGHT SHE'S OUT IN CAMBRIDGE
SHE WAS SURE MRS FARRINDER WOULD BE INTERESTED
BY THE TIME BASIL CAME TO THE NORTH--MAKING ADVANCES AS IT WERE--MRS CHANCELLOR HAD PASSED AWAY
THAT HE LIVED IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT EUROPE AND THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED SHE WAS DOMICILED IN NEW YORK
THAT PROVES AS I SAY HOW IN SPITE OF YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF HORROR YOU DELIGHT IN THE SHOCK OF BATTLE
BUT IN DOING SO SHE WAS IN THE POSITION SINGULAR FOR HER OF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T WANT THEM OUTSIDE OF HIS OFFICE IN PINE STREET
AS SHE KNEW HOW TO DO OTHER THINGS SHE KNEW HOW TO STUDY
IS IT A PARTY
HE WAS INCAPABLE OF GIVING AN OFF-HAND ANSWER OR OPINION ON THE SIMPLEST OCCASION AND HIS TONE OF HIGH DELIBERATION INCREASED IN PROPORTION AS THE SUBJECT WAS TRIVIAL OR DOMESTIC
SHE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ASKING HIM NOW WHETHER HE WOULD NOT STAY TO DINNER--SHE HOPED ADELINE HAD GIVEN HIM HER MESSAGE
HE ASKED WHY WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE PROGRAMME ONE HADN'T BEGUN TO FEEL THEIR ONSET WHY THE ECHOES OF MISS TARRANT'S ELOQUENCE HADN'T REACHED HIS EARS
SHE HAD SEEN THEM BEFORE AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S
THEN OLIVE SAID TO HER TAKING HER HAND AGAIN THAT SHE WANTED HER TO ASSURE HER OF THIS--THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING IN ALL THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR THE REDEMPTION OF WOMEN THE THING SHE HOPED UNDER PROVIDENCE TO GIVE HER LIFE TO
SHE WOULD HAVE DESPISED HER HAD SHE THOUGHT HER CAPABLE OF ANOTHER COURSE
HE WAS SOLEMNLY CIVIL TO MISS CHANCELLOR HANDED HER THE DISHES AT TABLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND VENTURED TO INTIMATE THAT THE APPLE-FRITTERS WERE VERY FINE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF YOU
THEY DON'T CARE FOR YOU
BUT SHE BRIDGED IT OVER LIGHTLY NOW BY SAYING TO BASIL RANSOM
SHE HAD THE SWEETEST MOST UNWORLDLY FACE AND YET WITH IT AN AIR OF BEING ON EXHIBITION OF BELONGING TO A TROUPE OF LIVING IN THE GASLIGHT WHICH PERVADED EVEN THE DETAILS OF HER DRESS FASHIONED EVIDENTLY WITH AN ATTEMPT AT THE HISTRIONIC
SELAH SAID HIS WIFE LAYING HER HAND ON THE SLEEVE OF HIS WATERPROOF I WONDER WHETHER MISS BIRDSEYE WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HEAR VERENA WELL IF YOU MEAN SHE SINGS IT'S A SHAME I HAVEN'T GOT A PIANO MISS BIRDSEYE TOOK UPON HERSELF TO RESPOND
IT IS SO RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE COME AND IT PROVES HOW RIGHT I WAS THESE REMARKS FELL FROM MISS CHANCELLOR'S LIPS ONE BY ONE AS SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH WITH THE TREMOR THAT WAS ALWAYS IN HER VOICE EVEN WHEN SHE WAS THE LEAST EXCITED WHILE SHE MADE VERENA SIT DOWN NEAR HER ON THE SOFA AND LOOKED AT HER ALL OVER IN A MANNER THAT CAUSED THE GIRL TO REJOICE AT HAVING PUT ON THE JACKET WITH THE GILT BUTTONS
THEY HATE IT
HE MET HER EYE AGAIN
IT WAS ALL DONE WITH THE HANDS--WHAT WASN'T DONE WITH THE TONGUE
IT WAS TRUE THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN A BOY SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE SOME RELATION TO A GIRL WHEREAS DOCTOR PRANCE APPEARED TO BEAR NONE WHATEVER
IT INCLUDED AND EXCEEDED EVERY OTHER AND IT WAS A POOR CONSOLATION THAT SELAH POSSESSED AS A SUBSTITUTE--HIS CAREER AS A HEALER TO SPEAK OF NONE OTHER WAS THERE TO PROVE IT--THE ELOQUENCE OF THE HAND
XX SHE HOPED SHE SHOULD NOT SOON SEE HIM AGAIN AND THERE APPEARED TO BE NO REASON SHE SHOULD IF THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS TO BE CONDUCTED BY MEANS OF CHEQUES
DON'T SAY THE TOY--SAY THE JOY RANSOM EXCLAIMED
THE MEMORY OF ALL THE WINTER NIGHTS THEY HAD TRAMPED THROUGH THE SLUSH THE TICKETS ALAS
IT OPENED UP BEFORE HER IN THOSE WONDERFUL COLLOQUIES WITH OLIVE IN THE MOST INSPIRING WAY
THIS YOUNG LADY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE TOLD HER EVEN IF SHE HERSELF KNEW WHICH SHE DIDN'T AND OLIVE DESTITUTE OF THE QUALITY HAD NO MEANS OF TAKING THE MEASURE IN ANOTHER OF THE SUBTLE FEMININE DESIRE TO PLEASE
SHE MUST DO HER THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT SHE HATED THE TARRANTS THE FATHER AND MOTHER
IF THEY WERE WANTED THEIR HOUR WOULD STRIKE
WELL TRY TO COME ON
THE CORNER ITSELF WAS FORMED BY A CONSIDERABLE GROCER'S SHOP THE NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WHICH WAS FATAL TO ANY PRETENSIONS RANSOM AND HIS FELLOW-LODGERS MIGHT HAVE HAD IN REGARD TO GENTILITY OF SITUATION
I AM ONLY MYSELF I ONLY RISE TO THE OCCASION WHEN I SEE PREJUDICE WHEN I SEE BIGOTRY WHEN I SEE INJUSTICE WHEN I SEE CONSERVATISM MASSED BEFORE ME LIKE AN ARMY
SHE HAD HEARD OF THESE THINGS IN DETAIL ONLY TEN MINUTES BEFORE FROM THE GIRL'S PARENTS BUT HER HOSPITABLE SOUL HAD NEEDED BUT A MOMENT TO SWALLOW AND ASSIMILATE THEM
JUST AS SHE WAS SEEMED TO HER INDEED VERY WELL
SO WHY SHOULD YOU MAKE A DISTINCTION MY DEAR MADAM SAID RANSOM DOES A WOMAN CONSIST OF NOTHING BUT HER OPINIONS
THE PERSON WHO HAD ISSUED FROM THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE STEPS VERY SLOWLY AS IF ON PURPOSE TO GIVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE
IT ISN'T EVERYBODY THAT DOES ME THE HONOUR TO PERCEIVE THAT
HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AGAINST GENERALISATIONS WHICH MIGHT BE HASTY
A PERSON WHO MIGHT HAVE OVERHEARD SOME OF THE TALK OF THIS POSSIBLY INFATUATED PAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THEIR EXTREME FAMILIARITY WITH THE IDEA OF EARTHLY GLORY
THEY HAD HAD THAT DEFINITION SO OFTEN BEFORE AND MISS CHANCELLOR HAD HAD OCCASION SO OFTEN TO REMIND HER WHAT SUCCESS REALLY WAS
RANSOM MIGHT HAVE EXULTED IF HE HAD GONE BACK FAR ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THAT MYSTERY
SHE COULD FANCY HOW MRS BURRAGE WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER SON HAD BEEN REFUSED BY THE DAUGHTER OF A MESMERIC HEALER
HE HAD THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMICAL QUESTIONS FORMS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE HAPPINESS OF PEOPLES
THOUGH IN SPITE OF HER WANTING TO TURN EVERYTHING OVER AND PUT THE LOWEST HIGHEST SHE COULD BE JUST AS CONTEMPTUOUS AND INVIDIOUS WHEN IT CAME TO REALLY MIXING AS IF SHE WERE SOME GRAND OLD DUCHESS
WHEN SHE TURNED IT UPON YOU YOU THOUGHT VAGUELY OF THE GLITTER OF GREEN ICE
SOUTHERNERS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SO CHIVALROUS
IT CAME OVER ME--JUST SEEING THOSE YOUNG MEN--HOW EXPOSED YOU ARE
THERE IS SO MUCH I WANT TO ASK YOU SAID OLIVE
SHE KNEW IT HAD BEEN FIXED WITH MRS TARRANT
THAT IS ALL CLEAR TO ME NOW
IT PRESSED UPON THEM FAR MORE THAN ON THE OTHERS THE INTOLERABLE LOAD OF FATE
IT WAS HIS PRIVATE REFLEXION COLOURED DOUBTLESS BY SECTIONAL PREJUDICE THAT SHE WAS THE FIRST PRETTY GIRL HE HAD SEEN IN BOSTON
HE WALKED SLOWLY UP FIFTH AVENUE INTO WHICH OUT OF ADELINE'S CROSS-STREET HE HAD TURNED BY THE LIGHT OF A FINE WINTER MOON
SHE WAS NOT OLD--SHE WAS SHARPLY YOUNG
EVEN AFTER ALL HER MOTHER'S DISQUISITIONS VERENA HAD BUT VAGUE IDEAS AS TO WHOM SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THEM TO BE
THEY CARE ONLY FOR THEIR PLEASURE FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE RIGHT OF THE STRONGER
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT TOO
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT TOO
I HAD A MAGNIFICENT AUDIENCE LAST SPRING IN ST LOUIS A FRESH YOUNG VOICE ANNOUNCED OVER THE HEADS OF THE GATHERED GROUP--A VOICE WHICH ON BASIL'S TURNING LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE FOR AN EXPLANATION APPEARED TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE PRETTY GIRL WITH RED HAIR
SHE ALSO HAD DREAMED OF A FRIENDSHIP THOUGH IT WAS NOT WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF MOST AND IT CAME OVER HER THAT THIS WAS THE ONE WHICH FORTUNE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KEEPING
HE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED SHE HAD GUESSED WHAT HE WAS THINKING OF
MISS CHANCELLOR COULD IMAGINE WHETHER AS AN OLD FRIEND HE COULD WATCH SUCH A BEAUTIFUL UNFOLDING WITH INDIFFERENCE
THOROUGH STUDY OF THE QUESTION HE CARED FOR MOST--WAS NOT THE CHANCE FOR THAT AN INFINITELY DESIRABLE GOOD
HE WAS NOT TOO OLD BUT TOO NEW
OLIVE WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM TO YOUR FEMALE CONVENTION MRS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER
FIRST THAT SHE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN MR HENRY BURRAGE AND SECOND THAT HER NATURE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL
NO ITALICS CAN REPRESENT THE EARNESTNESS OF MRS TARRANT'S EMPHASIS
YOU ARE TO BELONG TO ME MRS LUNA SAID HAVING THOUGHT OVER HER SOUTHERN KINSMAN DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND MADE UP HER MIND THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD MAN FOR A LONE WOMAN TO KNOW
I OUGHTN'T TO GIVE ANY ONE THE RIGHT TO SAY THAT IT'S A WOMAN'S QUALITY
DO YOU LIVE HERE ALL ALONE SHE ASKED OF OLIVE
HE HAD NEVER BELIEVED MUCH IN HIS LUCK BUT DURING THE LAST YEAR IT HAD BEEN GUILTY OF ABERRATIONS SURPRISING EVEN TO A CONSTANT AN IMPERTURBABLE VICTIM OF FATE
SHE HAD KEPT A RUNAWAY SLAVE IN HER HOUSE FOR THIRTY DAYS
FIRST SHE HAD SEEMED TO WANT TO TAKE HER IN THEN SHE HAD SHIED AT HER UNMISTAKABLY--INTIMATING TO OLIVE THAT THERE WERE ENOUGH OF THAT KIND ALREADY
SHE HAD TRIED TO KILL THAT NERVE TO PERSUADE HERSELF THAT TASTE WAS ONLY FRIVOLITY IN THE DISGUISE OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU CONVERSED SOME WITH DOCTOR PRANCE TO MY GREAT EDIFICATION RANSOM EXCLAIMED
FORTUNATELY AS IT WOULD BE SUPPLIED TO HER IN ABUNDANCE IN CHARLES STREET
THIS LITTLE SOCIETY WAS RATHER SUBURBAN AND MISCELLANEOUS
BUT I AM AND I CAN'T HELP IT AND I'LL DO PENANCE ANY WAY YOU MAY PRESCRIBE
WHEN I REFLECT ON HIS HABITS OF ALMOST SUPERSTITIOUS POLITENESS TO WOMEN IT COMES OVER ME THAT SOME VERY STRONG MOTIVE MUST HAVE OPERATED TO MAKE HIM GIVE HIS FRIENDLY--HIS ONLY TOO FRIENDLY--COUSIN THE COLD SHOULDER
SHE'S JUST AS PURE AS SHE CAN LIVE
SHE WAS GLAD SOMEHOW FOR VERENA'S SAKE THAT THEY HAD EMERGED FROM THE PHASE OF SPIRIT-INTERCOURSE
SHE WAS FRIVOLOUS WORLDLY AN AMATEUR A TRIFLER A FREQUENTER OF BEACON STREET
WILL YOU COME AND SEE ME OH YES
YES SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING OLIVE CHANCELLOR SAID TO HERSELF
HADN'T SHE COME OUT YET IN PUBLIC
AND I WANT SO MUCH TO SEE AN OLD ABOLITIONIST
HE HAD GROWN VERY CURIOUS AND AMONG THE THINGS HE WANTED TO KNOW WAS WHY IN THE WORLD THIS TICKLISH SPINSTER HAD WRITTEN TO HIM
IT'S WHAT I CALL REAL CONVERSATION
SHE ONLY KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN CALLED TO SEE LADIES HE HAD WORKED ON AND SHE FOUND THAT HE HAD MADE THEM LOSE A LOT OF VALUABLE TIME
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE LIVED IN IMAGINATION THROUGH ALL THE AGES
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD SPENT HER LIFE ON PLATFORMS IN AUDIENCES IN CONVENTIONS IN PHALANSTERIES IN SEANCES
AND HE WAS CONSCIOUS AS A CANDID YOUNG AMERICAN THAT A MOTHER IS ALWAYS LESS ACCESSIBLE MORE GUARDED BY SOCIAL PREJUDICE THAN A DAUGHTER
THIS WAS AN ALLUSION TO A SMALL LUNCHEON-PARTY THAT OLIVE HAD GIVEN WHEN VERENA DISCOURSED TO A DOZEN MATRONS AND SPINSTERS SELECTED BY HER HOSTESS WITH INFINITE CONSIDERATION AND MANY SPIRITUAL SCRUPLES
THAT HE SHOULD AGREE SHE DID NOT IN THE LEAST EXPECT OF HIM
RANSOM CONSENTED WITH A LITTLE OF HIS SOUTHERN FLOURISH AND IN A MOMENT THE LADY GOT UP TO RECEIVE HIM FROM THE MIDST OF THE CIRCLE THAT NOW SURROUNDED HER
THEY MADE THAT YOUNG LADY FEEL THAT THEIR COMMON UNDERTAKING WOULD IN CONSEQUENCE BE SO MUCH MORE SERIOUS
HE HAD BEEN DILIGENT HE HAD BEEN AMBITIOUS BUT HE HAD NOT YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL
THIS IDEA STARTLED HIM ALARMED HIM A LITTLE SO THAT WHEN MRS LUNA SAID WITH HER SOCIABLE MANNER THERE IS NOTHING I LIKE SO MUCH OF A WINTER'S NIGHT AS A COSY TETE-A-TETE BY THE FIRE
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT LAST SUMMER
SHE MUST NOT LET IT BE ASSUMED THAT SHE WOULD COME FIRST TO THEM)--SHE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THIS HOSPITABLE SPEECH WHEN SHE FELT THE HAND OF HER HOSTESS UPON HER ARM AND BECAME AWARE THAT A PASSIONATE APPEAL SAT IN OLIVE'S EYES
THE EFFECT WAS NOT IN WHAT SHE SAID THOUGH SHE SAID SOME SUCH PRETTY THINGS BUT IN THE PICTURE AND FIGURE OF THE HALF-BEDIZENED DAMSEL PLAYING NOW AGAIN WITH HER RED FAN THE VISIBLE FRESHNESS AND PURITY OF THE LITTLE EFFORT
SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO RAISE MONEY FOR SOME CADAVEROUS POLE TO OBTAIN LESSONS FOR SOME SHIRTLESS ITALIAN
BUT SHE HAD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL REASON FOR IT
AND SHE SUGGESTED VERY SATIRICALLY THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD LIKE TO MARRY VERENA HIMSELF--HE SEEMED SO INTERESTED IN HER
SO DO MEN TOO I SUPPOSE
BUT INSTEAD OF THIS HE RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF VERENA
I KNOW NOT EXACTLY HOW THESE QUEER HERESIES HAD PLANTED THEMSELVES BUT HE HAD A LONGISH PEDIGREE IT HAD FLOWERED AT ONE TIME WITH ENGLISH ROYALISTS AND CAVALIERS AND HE SEEMED AT MOMENTS TO BE INHABITED BY SOME TRANSMITTED SPIRIT OF A ROBUST BUT NARROW ANCESTOR SOME BROAD-FACED WIG-WEARER OR SWORD-BEARER WITH A MORE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF MANHOOD THAN OUR MODERN TEMPERAMENT APPEARS TO REQUIRE AND A PROGRAMME OF HUMAN FELICITY MUCH LESS VARIED
WELL YOU SEE I DON'T GO OUT MUCH EXCEPT TO THE COURTS DO YOU MEAN THE LAW-COURTS
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM--WELL BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS HOW LONG SHE HAD SPOKEN
BUT THE WAY HER COMPANION ROSE WITH THE LEVEL OF THE CIVILISATION THAT SURROUNDED HER THE WAY SHE ASSIMILATED ALL DELICACIES AND ABSORBED ALL TRADITIONS LEFT THIS FRIENDLY THEORY HALTING BEHIND
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE HARVARD COLLEGE OR DO YOU NOT HE DEMANDED WITH A HUMOROUS FROWN
MISS CHANCELLOR KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM AS WELL AS IF SHE HAD HEARD IT
HER PASSIONATE IMPATIENCE APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN WAY TO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS TO BE REPLACED BY THE RESIGNATION THAT COMES WITH DEEPER REFLEXION
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD GUESSED BY A SUBTLE FEMININE FACULTY THAT HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER WAS NOTHING TO BOAST OF
SHE IS A PUBLIC CHARACTER
THE FACT WAS SHE WAS A GREAT CARD AND SOME ONE OUGHT TO PLAY IT
BUT HE WAS NOT A PERSON TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO DROOP
BASIL COULD SEE THAT DOCTOR PRANCE WAS IRRITATED
THE CHANGE IN THE DREADFUL POSITION OF WOMEN WAS NOT A QUESTION FOR TO-DAY SIMPLY OR FOR TO-MORROW BUT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO STUDY
I CAN'T TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE I CAN'T SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
SHE TOOK ALL THAT WAS GIVEN HER AND WAS GRATEFUL AND MISSED NOTHING THAT WAS WITHHELD
BUT NOW SHE WAS SATISFIED THE REALISATION WAS COMPLETE AND WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO IMPOSE ON THE GIRL WAS AN EFFECTUAL RUPTURE WITH HER PAST
MRS BURRAGE ASKED HER SON TO PLAY SOME LITTLE THING AND HE SAT DOWN TO HIS PIANO AND REVEALED A TALENT THAT MIGHT WELL HAVE GRATIFIED THAT LADY'S PRIDE
SHE SMILES AT ME AS IF SHE LIKED ME HE COULD NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS FATUOUS THAT SHE SMILED SO AT EVERY ONE
WHEN VERENA SHOULD APPEAR IT WOULD BE ARMED AT ALL POINTS LIKE JOAN OF ARC THIS ANALOGY HAD LODGED ITSELF IN OLIVE'S IMAGINATION
THAT WAS YEARS BEFORE WHEN THIS GIRL MUST HAVE BEEN A CHILD
THEY WOULD HAVE TEA AND THERE WOULD BE OTHER LADIES AND OLIVE WOULD TELL HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF A LIFE THAT WAS SO CROWDED WITH BEAUTY
MRS FARRINDER SAID
BUT EVEN TO MISS BIRDSEYE'S UNSOPHISTICATED MIND THIS SCARCELY APPEARED AS REGARDS A GUEST AN ADEQUATE FORMULA OF DISMISSAL
IT SEEMS AS IF NO ONE HAD ESCAPED RANSOM WAS DISAPPOINTED
HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO NO PRECIPITATE ELATION AT THE IDEA OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING TAKEN UP BY A PATRONESS OF MOVEMENTS WHO HAPPENED TO HAVE MONEY
AT THIS MOMENT HE HEARD OLIVE CHANCELLOR AT HIS ELBOW WITH THE TREMOR OF EXCITEMENT IN HER TONE SUDDENLY EXCLAIM
THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE OF HIS MIND HAD SUDDENLY BEEN ILLUMINATED
THIS EFFORT WITH HIM HAD MANY FORMS
IT WAS EITHER NOT NEW OR NOT DISAGREEABLE TO HER THAT THE AUTHORS OF HER BEING SHOULD BE BOUGHT OFF SILENCED BY MONEY TREATED AS THE TROUBLESOME OF THE LOWER ORDERS ARE TREATED WHEN THEY ARE NOT LOCKED UP
HENRY BURRAGE SAID TO VERENA AS SHE WAS GOING THAT HE HOPED SHE WOULD THINK SERIOUSLY OF HIS MOTHER'S INVITATION
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF SOCIETY LARGE AND VOLUMINOUS FAIR IN COMPLEXION AND REGULARLY UGLY LOOKING AS IF SHE OUGHT TO BE SLOW AND RATHER HEAVY BUT DISAPPOINTING THIS EXPECTATION BY A QUICK AMUSED UTTERANCE A SHORT BRIGHT SUMMARY LAUGH WITH WHICH SHE APPEARED TO DISPOSE OF THE JOKE WHATEVER IT WAS FOR EVER AND AN AIR OF RECOGNISING ON THE INSTANT EVERYTHING SHE SAW AND HEARD
THIS DID NOT PREVENT OLIVE FROM MAKING UP HER MIND THAT THEY HAD BETTER GO TO EUROPE IN THE SPRING
THAT WHEN SHE SAID COME SOON SHE MEANT THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO TAKE IT ANYHOW ONE MUST KNOW WHEN TO GO FORWARD GRACEFULLY
IT'S DIVINE IT WAS SO MUCH WHAT SHE MEANT THAT SHE HAD LAIN AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING OF IT AND THE SUBSTANCE OF HER THOUGHT WAS THAT IF SHE COULD ONLY RESCUE THE GIRL FROM THE DANGER OF VULGAR EXPLOITATION COULD ONLY CONSTITUTE HERSELF HER PROTECTRESS AND DEVOTEE THE TWO BETWEEN THEM MIGHT ACHIEVE THE GREAT RESULT
SHE STRUCK HIM AS VERY POOR BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARD THAT HE LEARNED SHE HAD NEVER HAD A PENNY IN HER LIFE
I'M SURE WE ARE ALL SOLID AS DOCTOR TARRANT SAYS
SHE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT HAD RUFFLED HER BUT AT THE SAME INSTANT THERE PASSED BEFORE HER THE VISION OF THE ANXIETIES OF THIS SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED SORT FOR INSTANCE AND MUCH WORSE WHICH INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH MISS CHANCELLOR MIGHT ENTAIL
WELL IS HER MIND FORMED AS I HAVEN'T SEEN IT I CANNOT TELL YOU AREN'T YOU GOING ON THERE TO SEE TO SEE WHETHER MISS TARRANT'S MIND IS FORMED MRS LUNA BROKE IN
OLIVE CHANCELLOR DESPISED VULGARITY HAD A SCENT FOR IT WHICH SHE FOLLOWED UP IN HER OWN FAMILY SO THAT OFTEN WITH A RISING FLUSH SHE DETECTED THE TAINT EVEN IN ADELINE
BUT SHE HAD WAIVED IT IN THIS CASE
IF IT COULD ONLY BE KNOWN THAT SHE SPOKE FOR NOTHING THAT MIGHT DEEPEN THE REVERBERATION
XXII AS HE SAT WITH MRS LUNA IN HER LITTLE BACK DRAWING-ROOM UNDER THE LAMP HE FELT RATHER MORE TOLERANT THAN BEFORE OF THE PRESSURE SHE COULD NOT HELP PUTTING UPON HIM
THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ONCE MORE IN BOSTON WITH A CERTAIN CONTIGUITY THAT IT SEEMED TO IMPLY BETWEEN BOSTON AND NEW YORK PRESENTED ITSELF NOW AS IMPORTANT AND AGREEABLE
MRS LUNA HAD TAKEN UP HER BIT OF CROCHET
OLIVE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SAY OR TO FEEL ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE HIM SHORT ANSWERS
HAVEN'T YOU NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
BUT WHAT STRUCK HIM RATHER WAS THE ODDITY OF SO SUDDEN A SHARPNESS OF PITCH IN AN INTERCOURSE WHICH AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE HAD BEGUN IN PERFECT AMITY AND HE BURST ONCE MORE INTO AN IRREPRESSIBLE LAUGH
THEY HAD INNUMERABLE BIG BOOKS FROM THE ATHENAEUM AND CONSUMED THE MIDNIGHT OIL
IT SEEMED TO OUR YOUNG LADY THAT NOTHING COULD BE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN TO OWE HER EMANCIPATION TO SUCH A ONE AS MATTHIAS PARDON
THE TWO SIDES OF THE SHOP WERE PROTECTED BY AN IMMENSE PENT-HOUSE SHED WHICH PROJECTED OVER A GREASY PAVEMENT AND WAS SUPPORTED BY WOODEN POSTS FIXED IN THE CURBSTONE
SHE DIDN'T DETEST HIM IN CONSEQUENCE
HE KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED OF OLD--THAT IS A YEAR AGO
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN HELP BEING A GOOD DEAL SHAKEN BY HER
SHE THOUGHT ALL WISE PEOPLE WANTED GREAT CHANGES BUT THE VOTARIES OF CHANGE WERE NOT NECESSARILY WISE
AT FIRST SHE WENT IN BECAUSE HER MOTHER LIKED TO HAVE HER
BUT HE PERCEIVED AT THE SAME TIME THAT MRS LUNA DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE HOUSE TO SPEAK OF
I PRESUME SHE WOULDN'T CARE TO COME OUT JUST TO SEE US SHE BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AT THIS PERIOD COULD REFER ONLY TO OLIVE CHANCELLOR WHO WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LITTLE HOUSE AT CAMBRIDGE AT ALL HOURS AND FROM EVERY POSSIBLE POINT OF VIEW
YOU HAD BETTER GO THERE WITH ME SHE ADDED WITH A CERTAIN INCONSEQUENCE
HE REMARKED TO HER THAT MISS VERENA WAS VERY PRETTY
MISS BIRDSEYE REPLIED THAT THERE WAS SOME COMING IN A MOMENT
OH WELL I GUESS I CAN ABSTAIN VERENA EXCLAIMED WITH A LAUGH
VERENA WHO WHEN OLIVE WAS NOT WITH HER INDULGED IN A GOOD DEAL OF DESULTORY CONTEMPLATION AT THE WINDOW SAW THEM PASS THE HOUSE IN CHARLES STREET ALWAYS APPARENTLY STRAINING A LITTLE AS IF THEY MIGHT BE TOO LATE FOR SOMETHING
SHE RECEIVED MISS CHANCELLOR IN THE HALL OF THE MANSION WHICH HAD A SALIENT FRONT AN ENORMOUS AND VERY HIGH NUMBER--756--PAINTED IN GILT ON THE GLASS LIGHT ABOVE THE DOOR A TIN SIGN BEARING THE NAME OF A DOCTRESS MARY J
WHOEVER THEY WERE THEY WERE SURE TO HAVE THAT DEFECT
HE KNEW IN BOSTON NO SUCH FIGURE AS THAT SAVE MISS BIRDSEYE
SHE SHOULD BE AS FREE AS AIR TO GO AND COME
THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT HE WILL DO WITH YOU AND HOW FAR HIS LOVE WILL TAKE HIM
THIS DID NOT PREVENT HER BEING A CONFUSED ENTANGLED INCONSEQUENT DISCURSIVE OLD WOMAN WHOSE CHARITY BEGAN AT HOME AND ENDED NOWHERE WHOSE CREDULITY KEPT PACE WITH IT AND WHO KNEW LESS ABOUT HER FELLOW-CREATURES IF POSSIBLE AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF HUMANITARY ZEAL THAN ON THE DAY SHE HAD GONE INTO THE FIELD TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE INIQUITY OF MOST ARRANGEMENTS
BUT SHE HAD A FOREBODING THAT OF THE TWO GRIEVANCES FORTUNE WOULD CONFER UPON HER ONLY THE LESS
MANY OF THEM SEEMED TO HER WEAK TO IMBECILITY LOSING SIGHT OF ALL MEASURES AND STANDARDS LAVISHING SUPERLATIVES DELIGHTED TO BE FOOLED
NOW I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GOING THE VERY MOMENT I APPEAR RANSOM WENT ON
RANSOM WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE LOOKED LIKE AN ORIENTAL IF IT WERE NOT THAT ORIENTALS ARE DARK
WHEN SHE HAD GAINED CONFIDENCE SHE OPENED HER EYES AND THEIR SHINING SOFTNESS WAS HALF THE EFFECT OF HER DISCOURSE
BUT SHE WAS IRRITATED AND PRETENDED A UNIVERSAL IGNORANCE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD NEVER TOLD SO MANY FIBS BY WHICH HER HOSTESS WAS MUCH DISCONCERTED ALTHOUGH HER QUESTIONS HAD APPARENTLY BEEN QUESTIONS PURE AND SIMPLE LEADING NOWHITHER AND WITHOUT BEARINGS ON ANY NEW TRUTH
I MAKE AN ENORMOUS INCOME THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED
MOREOVER IT WOULD DO HER GOOD TO BREAK UP HER WORK NOW AND THEN
THEY WERE SUMMED UP IN THE VAGUE COMPASSION WHICH HIS COUSIN'S FIGURE EXCITED IN HIS MIND AND WHICH WAS YET ACCOMPANIED WITH A SENSIBLE RELUCTANCE TO KNOW HER BETTER OBVIOUS AS IT WAS THAT WITH SUCH A FACE AS THAT SHE MUST BE REMARKABLE
IF OLIVE'S WAS A HIGH NATURE AND SO WAS HERS THE FAULT WAS IN NEITHER
BUT IT REMAINED ABSTRACT PLATONIC
SHE STOOD THERE AN INSTANT TURNING OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY A GLANCE LIKE THE FLASH OF A WATCHMAN'S BULL'S-EYE AND THEN QUICKLY PASSED OUT
HER SHARE IN THE UNION OF THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WAS NO LONGER PASSIVE PURELY APPRECIATIVE
AND THE TWO LADIES HAD A GRAND DISCUSSION ON THIS POINT BEFORE MRS LUNA LEFT BOSTON--A SCENE WHICH ENDED IN ADELINE'S CLUTCHING THE IRREPRESSIBLE NEWTON TO HER BOSOM HE CAME IN AT THE MOMENT AND DEMANDING OF HIM A VOW THAT HE WOULD LIVE AND DIE IN THE PRINCIPLES OF HIS MOTHER
MRS TARRANT THEORISED ABOUT TEMPERAMENTS AND SHE LOVED HER DAUGHTER
AND VERENA WAS THOROUGHLY INTERESTED IN THEIR GREAT UNDERTAKING
THE VIEW SEEMED TO HIM VERY PICTURESQUE THOUGH IN THE GATHERED DUSK LITTLE WAS LEFT OF IT SAVE A COLD YELLOW STREAK IN THE WEST A GLEAM OF BROWN WATER AND THE REFLEXION OF THE LIGHTS THAT HAD BEGUN TO SHOW THEMSELVES IN A ROW OF HOUSES IMPRESSIVE TO RANSOM IN THEIR EXTREME MODERNNESS WHICH OVERLOOKED THE SAME LAGOON FROM A LONG EMBANKMENT ON THE LEFT CONSTRUCTED OF STONES ROUGHLY PILED
BUT IF YOU DON'T IT MUST NOT BE BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROMISED ME
IF HE DID NOT MASTER HIS LESSONS HE MASTERED HIS TEACHERS AND SHE HAD THE HAPPY CONVICTION THAT SHE GAVE HIM EVERY ADVANTAGE
SHE HAD NO WISH NOW TO ENTER INTO AN EXAMINATION OF THAT PARTICULAR ONE
HE COULD ONLY ANSWER THIS SUDDEN GLEAM WITH A STARE AND WONDER AFRESH WHAT TRICK HIS NORTHERN KINSWOMAN WAS DESTINED TO PLAY HIM
SHE HADN'T PREVENTED HIM AND NOW SHE DIDN'T CARE FOR NOW AS SHE INTIMATED SHE HAD THE INTEREST OF VERENA AND THAT MADE HER INDIFFERENT TO EVERY DANGER TO EVERY ORDINARY PLEASURE
BESIDES HE DIDN'T WISH TO ASSENT TO WHAT SHE HAD SAID
PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T--I DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID SMILING AND STROKING HIS LEG
WARS ALWAYS MORE WARS AND ALWAYS MORE AND MORE
BASIL RANSOM NOTICED ALL THESE THINGS AND NOTICED ALSO OPPOSITE THE WAITING FACE OF HIS COUSIN FIXED FROM HER SOFA UPON THE CLOSED EYES OF THE YOUNG PROPHETESS
WHEN WE SHALL ALL BE LOOKING TO HER GATHERING ABOUT HER PRAYING FOR HER THERE WAS AN EXCEEDING SCORN IN HER VOICE
MRS FARRINDER WHO WAS DECIDEDLY A WOMAN OF THE WORLD CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE OR TO MISS CHANCELLOR'S AND SAID SHE HOPED VERY MUCH OLIVE WOULDN'T STAY--SHE FELT THESE THINGS TOO MUCH
TO SPEAK--THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO DO FOR NOTHING
WELL I WANTED TO GO FARTHER THE GIRL CONTINUED BUT I HAD NO FRIENDS
SHE HAD A PREFERENCE FOR WHAT SHE CALLED REAL PEOPLE AND THERE WERE SEVERAL WHOSE REALITY SHE HAD TESTED BY ARTS KNOWN TO HERSELF
THIS WAS JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER--IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
NOT ONLY HAD HE NOT EXTENDED HIS CONNEXION BUT HE HAD LOST MOST OF THE LITTLE BUSINESS WHICH WAS AN OBJECT OF COMPLACENCY TO HIM A TWELVEMONTH BEFORE
SHE MUST BE OFF TO HER DINNER NOW SHE SAW THE CARRIAGE WAS THERE AND IN HER ABSENCE OLIVE MIGHT GIVE ANY VERSION OF HER SHE CHOSE
BUT THIS GENTLEMAN HIMSELF AS IT TURNED OUT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR A GOOD DEAL OF REMODELLING AND RANSOM'S PRINCIPAL DEFICIENCY WHICH WAS AFTER ALL THAT OF CASH WAS NOT LESS APPARENT TO HIM AFTER HIS COLLEAGUE PRIOR TO A SUDDEN AND UNEXPLAINED DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE HAD DRAWN THE SLENDER ACCUMULATIONS OF THE FIRM OUT OF THE BANK
THEY WILL WORK TOGETHER FOR A GREAT GOOD I HOPE SO RANSOM REMARKED
AND MISS BIRDSEYE'S VISITORS FOR THE REST SETTLED THEMSELVES ATTENTIVELY IN CHAIRS OR LEANED AGAINST THE BARE SIDES OF THE PARLOUR
DON'T YOU WANT ANY PROMISE AT PRESENT VERENA ASKED
AT MOMENTS MRS BURRAGE BENT HER COUNTENANCE UPON HER AND SMILED AT RANDOM KINDLY
SHE WANTED TO GO AWAY AND YET SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO LEAVE VERENA TO BE EXPLOITED AS SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD BE AFTER HER DEPARTURE THAT INDEED SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN BY THOSE OFFENSIVE YOUNG MEN
IT'S SO MUCH TO ME TO SEE YOU
AND THE SIMPLEST RESPONSE WAS TO KISS MISS CHANCELLOR AN ACT WHICH SHE BRIEFLY PERFORMED
IF YOU WANT AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT ON HARVARD COLLEGE NOW'S YOUR CHANCE
HER EMOTION WAS STILL ACUTE HOWEVER MUCH SHE MIGHT SPEAK TO HER VISITOR AS IF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED SEEMED TO HER NATURAL
I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO OTHERS
NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISPLEASING THAN THIS INDIFFERENCE WHEN PEOPLE DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOU
SHE HAD A PRIVATE CONVICTION THAT HE PARTOOK AT THE HOUSES OF HIS LADY PATIENTS OF LITTLE LUNCHES
TOWARD NINE O'CLOCK THE LIGHT OF HER HISSING BURNERS SMOTE THE MAJESTIC PERSON OF MRS FARRINDER WHO MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S IN THE NEGATIVE
IT WAS THE LAST THING THAT SHE WANTED TO BE THOUGHT
HE SAID SOMETHING TO MRS FARRINDER SOMETHING THAT IMPERFECTLY REPRESENTED HIS ADMIRATION OF VERENA
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO IN HIMSELF BODILY AND FAILING IN THIS HE HOPED TO GET ADVERTISEMENTS INSERTED GRATIS
HE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HE REPLIED
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAD LITTLE COMFORT FOR HIM
HOWEVER HE WAS GOOD FOR ANY GAME--THAT ONE AS WELL AS ANOTHER--AND HE SAW THAT HE WAS IN FOR SOMETHING OF WHICH HE HAD LONG DESIRED TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW
SHE APPEALED TO VERENA TO SHARE IN HER PLEDGE THAT THE WORLD SHOULD KNOW IN DUE TIME HOW MUCH OF THAT SORT OF THING THERE WAS ABOUT HER
OR AN OLD MONARCHICAL EMIGRE FROM THE LANGUEDOC THE DESPOILED PATRICIATE I SAY WHOSE ATTITUDE WAS NOBLE AND TOUCHING AND TOWARD WHOM ONE MIGHT EXERCISE A CHARITY AS DISCREET AS THEIR PRIDE WAS SENSITIVE
SHE WAS A LITTLE OLD LADY WITH AN ENORMOUS HEAD
AND FOR HIM IF A DIVINER DAY WAS TO COME UPON EARTH IT WOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY COPIOUS ADVERTISEMENT IN THE DAILY PRINTS
I WILL GO IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO
NEITHER OF HER COMPANIONS HAD AN IDEA THAT IN LEAVING THEM SIMPLY PLANTED FACE TO FACE THE TERROR OF THE AMERICAN HEART SHE HAD SO HIGH A WARRANT
THE COVERED LAMPS MADE A GLOW HERE AND THERE AND THE CABINETS AND BRACKETS PRODUCED BROWN SHADOWS OUT OF WHICH SOME PRECIOUS OBJECT GLEAMED--SOME IVORY CARVING OR CINQUE-CENTO CUP
IT SO HAPPENED THAT IN THE WEST IT HAD TAKEN THE FORM OF A CONSIDERABLE ELOQUENCE
SHE HAD NO IDEA WHATEVER OF JUDGING HER PARENTS
BUT IF SHE EXPECTED TO CONVEY THIS IDEA TO HIM BY WITHHOLDING ANY SUGGESTION THAT HE SHOULD SIT DOWN SHE WAS GREATLY MISTAKEN INASMUCH AS HE CUT THE GROUND FROM UNDER HER FEET BY HIMSELF OFFERING HER A CHAIR
IT WAS HER GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR THE CAREER SHE HAD PROPOSED TO HERSELF THAT IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS SHE WAS LIABLE SUDDENLY TO BECOME BOLD
I FEEL IT AS A DEEP UNFORGETTABLE WRONG
THE UNEXPECTED TEMPERANCE OF HER SPEECH ON THIS SUBJECT OF VERENA'S ACCESSIBILITY TO MATRIMONIAL ERROR SEEMED TO THE GIRL TO HAVE AN ANTIQUE BEAUTY A WISDOM PURGED OF WORLDLY ELEMENTS
OLIVE CHANCELLOR REGULATED HER CONDUCT ON LOFTY PRINCIPLES AND THIS IS WHY HAVING TO-NIGHT THE ADVANTAGE OF A GENTLEMAN'S PROTECTION SHE SENT FOR A CARRIAGE TO OBLITERATE THAT PATRONAGE
THIS WAS RATHER TOO STRONG
HER SENSE OF THE WAY IT MIGHT STRIKE HIM OPERATED AS A COGENT NOT AS A DETERRENT REASON
WE GENERALLY FIND THE STUDENTS ENJOY IT SO MUCH THIS OFFICE WAS ULTIMATELY DELEGATED TO SELAH WHO AFTER A CONSIDERABLE ABSENCE REAPPEARED WITH A DISH OF DAINTIES WHICH HE PRESENTED SUCCESSIVELY TO EACH MEMBER OF THE COMPANY
MRS LUNA LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SUSPENDED NEEDLE
THEY ADMIRED THE SUNSETS THEY REJOICED IN THE RUDDY SPOTS PROJECTED UPON THE PARLOUR-WALL THEY FOLLOWED THE DARKENING PERSPECTIVE IN FANCIFUL EXCURSIONS
SHE WAS ESSENTIALLY A SOCIABLE CREATURE
HER TASTE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM HER SISTER'S WHO TOOK AN INTEREST ONLY IN THE LOWER CLASS AS IT STRUGGLED TO RISE
SHE HAS ACTED ON SO MANY I SEE
HE WAS WEAKLY PRETENTIOUS SOFTLY ORIGINAL CULTIVATED ECCENTRICITY PATRONISED PROGRESS LIKED TO HAVE MYSTERIES SUDDEN APPOINTMENTS TO KEEP ANONYMOUS PERSONS TO VISIT THE AIR OF LEADING A DOUBLE LIFE OF BEING DEVOTED TO A GIRL WHOM PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW OR AT LEAST DIDN'T MEET
MRS FARRINDER SPOKE IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO TOOK VIEWS SO WIDE THAT THEY MIGHT EASILY AT FIRST BEFORE YOU COULD SEE HOW SHE WORKED ROUND LOOK ALMOST MERETRICIOUS
HE HAD BEGUN HIS CAREER AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN BY GOING THE ROUNDS OF THE HOTELS TO CULL FLOWERS FROM THE BIG GREASY REGISTERS WHICH LIE ON THE MARBLE COUNTERS
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING RANSOM NOTICED--THE VAST FAIR PROTUBERANT CANDID UNGARNISHED BROW SURMOUNTING A PAIR OF WEAK KIND TIRED-LOOKING EYES AND INEFFECTUALLY BALANCED IN THE REAR BY A CAP WHICH HAD THE AIR OF FALLING BACKWARD AND WHICH MISS BIRDSEYE SUDDENLY FELT FOR WHILE SHE TALKED WITH UNSUCCESSFUL IRRELEVANT MOVEMENTS
IF OLIVE TROUBLED HERSELF LITTLE ABOUT ADELINE SHE TROUBLED HERSELF MORE ABOUT BASIL RANSOM
SHE WENT OFF WITH FLYING COLOURS IN A BLAZE OF FIREWORKS RANSOM PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NOT HEARD THIS AFFAIR MENTIONED TILL THAT MOMENT AND THEN WHEN THEY COMPARED DATES THEY FOUND IT HAD TAKEN PLACE JUST AFTER HIS LAST VISIT TO MRS LUNA
THIS THREW LIGHT ON HIS OWN SUSPICION THAT HE WAS ATTACHED TO CAUSES THAT COULD ONLY IN THE NATURE OF THINGS BE UNPOPULAR
SHE WAS VERY QUIET NOW AT LEAST SHE HAD FOLDED HER BIG FAN AND HER FATHER CONTINUED THE MYSTERIOUS PROCESS OF CALMING HER DOWN
OF COURSE I ONLY SPEAK TO WOMEN--TO MY OWN DEAR SISTERS
SHE MIGHT BE PECULIAR BUT SHE HAD PROTESTED AGAINST THE IDEA THAT SHE WAS DELICATE
SHE SAW THAT I WAS SHAKEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT
OLIVE HAD WISHED TO REALISE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH HER WONDERFUL YOUNG FRIEND SHE THOUGHT HER MORE WONDERFUL EVERY DAY HAD DEVELOPED AND TO THIS END AS I HAVE RELATED SHE PROMPTED HER TO INFINITE DISCOURSE
IT STOLE OVER HIM GENTLY THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SORT PRETTY VISIBLY OPEN TO HIM NOT SO ELEVATED NOR SO MANLY IT IS TRUE BUT ON WHICH HE SHOULD AFTER ALL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO RECONCILE IT WITH HIS HONOUR TO FALL BACK
IT'S ONLY YOU--JUST AS YOU ARE VERENA DROPPED HER EYES OVER THE FRONT OF HER DRESS
MEANWHILE BASIL RANSOM CONFESSED TO DOCTOR PRANCE THAT HE WAS AFTER ALL RATHER DISAPPOINTED
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS YOUNG AND LOVELY AS YOU ARE--GIVING YOUR LIFE VERENA LOOKED DOWN FOR A MOMENT IN MEDITATION
IN HER FADED FACE THERE WAS A KIND OF REFLEXION OF UGLY LECTURE-LAMPS
HE ASKED HER IF SHE WERE FOLLOWING ANY OF THE CURRENT SERIALS IN THE MAGAZINES
WELL YOU'LL SEND THEM AWAY NO BETTER THAN THEY CAME SAID MATTHIAS PARDON
THEY WOULD BE ISOLATED BUT THEY WOULD BE FREE
YES SAID DOCTOR PRANCE RATHER DRYLY I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHAT MISS BIRDSEYE CALLED ME UP FOR
THAT MUST BE OUR BIBLE NOW RANSOM FOUND HIMSELF LIKING MISS BIRDSEYE VERY MUCH AND IT WAS QUITE WITHOUT HYPOCRISY OR A TINGE TOO MUCH OF THE LOCAL QUALITY IN HIS SPEECH THAT HE SAID
MISS TARRANT MIGHT WEAR GILT BUTTONS FROM HEAD TO FOOT HER SOUL COULD NOT BE VULGAR
THIS QUESTION CAME TO HIM ONLY AS HE WALKED HOME THAT EVENING
HER EYES WERE FIXED ON THE FLOOR WITH THE RIGID ALARMED EXPRESSION OF HER MOMENTS OF NERVOUS DIFFIDENCE
HOWEVER IF SHE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HER MOTHER SAID ONE WOULD VERY SOON SEE IT
OLIVE HAD TO CONTENT HERSELF PROVISIONALLY WITH SAYING THAT HER PRECIOUS FACULTY HAD COME TO HER JUST AS HER BEAUTY AND DISTINCTION TO OLIVE SHE WAS FULL OF THAT QUALITY HAD COME
NO WOMAN COULD BE LESS INVIDIOUS BUT ON THE WHOLE SHE PREFERRED THESE TWO CLASSES OF THE HUMAN RACE
SHE IS VERY HONEST IS OLIVE CHANCELLOR
SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO ASK HERSELF WHY ONE SHOULD HAVE A QUARREL WITH IT
DECIDEDLY IT WAS NOT HIS DUTY TO MARRY MRS LUNA IN ORDER TO HAVE MEANS TO PURSUE HIS STUDIES
THEY PICKED UP SOMETHING BRIGHT BEFORE YOU COULD TURN ROUND
IT PLACED OLIVE UNDER THE SPELL
HE CAME IN FACT FROM MISSISSIPPI AND HE SPOKE VERY PERCEPTIBLY WITH THE ACCENT OF THAT COUNTRY
MERCY YES
BUT OLIVE MADE NO ANSWER TO THAT
THEN HE SAID IN A TONE WHICH EVIDENTLY WAS CAREFULLY CONSIDERATE I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THAT WELL FORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT REQUIRED NOW
THAT HE SHOULD BE THE FATHER OF A DELICATE PRETTY GIRL WHO WAS APPARENTLY CLEVER TOO WHETHER SHE HAD A GIFT OR NO THIS WAS AN ANNOYING DISCONCERTING FACT
FROM THIS FIRST INTERVIEW SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS SEIZED AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP ONLY SHUTTING HER EYES A LITTLE AS WE DO WHENEVER A PERSON IN WHOM WE HAVE PERFECT CONFIDENCE PROPOSES WITH OUR ASSENT TO SUBJECT US TO SOME SENSATION
IF WE HAD DONE ONLY THIS WE SHOULDN'T BOAST OF IT
I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PART OF THE WINTER THERE
THE ONLY RIGHT OF A WOMAN SHE WANTED WAS TO CLIMB UP ON TOP OF SOMETHING WHERE THE MEN COULD LOOK AT HER
IT IS TO BE FEARED THERE WAS NO DISGUISE OF RANSOM'S SATISFACTION AT FINDING HIMSELF ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE WITH THE CHARMING CREATURE WITH WHOM HE HAD EXCHANGED THAT FINAL SPEECHLESS SMILE THE EVENING BEFORE
SHE'S AN ASCETIC OH WELL WE HAVE HAD OUR DINNER RANSOM REJOINED LAUGHING
THE CURIOUS TINT OF HER EYES WAS A LIVING COLOUR
HE WAS FALSE CUNNING VULGAR IGNOBLE
I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD INTERFERE IF YOU KNEW HOW LITTLE YOU UNDERSTAND US MISS CHANCELLOR SAID TO RANSOM
THEY CERTAINLY MADE LOVELY CORRESPONDENTS
HE DID NOT DISLIKE HER SHE HAD BEEN SO FRIENDLY
SHE WAS VEXED AT HER DAUGHTER'S RESIGNATION TO NOT GOING TO PARTIES AND TO MISS CHANCELLOR'S NOT GIVING THEM
HE LOOKED LIKE THE PRIEST OF A RELIGION THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH THE STAGE OF MIRACLES
OLIVE MADE NO ANSWER
HE COULDN'T PRETEND TO SAY WHY HIS DAUGHTER SHOULD BE CALLED MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE
SHE HAD BENT AN EYE OF COLDNESS ON SELAH AND HIS WIFE--SHE MIGHT HAVE REGARDED THEM ALL AS A COMPANY OF MOUNTEBANKS
DON'T YOU RECOLLECT THAT RANSOM HESITATED AN INSTANT
I DON'T WANT YOUR SIGNATURE
SHE LOOKED UP PRESENTLY FROM HER WORK THEIR EYES MET AND SHE SMILED
WHAT SHE CLUNG TO WAS SOCIETY AND A POSITION IN THE WORLD WHICH A SECRET WHISPER TOLD HER SHE HAD NEVER HAD AND A VOICE MORE AUDIBLE REMINDED HER SHE WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING
AND THAT IN SHORT SHE MRS TARRANT KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT
BUT HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO VERENA AND SAID GOOD-BYE MISS TARRANT
SHE NEVER HELD BACK
BUT SHE STAYED ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO
WANT TO TRY A LITTLE INSPIRATION HE INQUIRED LOOKING ROUND ON THE CIRCLE WITH AN ENCOURAGING INFLEXION
SHE HAD INVITED FORTY PEOPLE TO HEAR MRS FARRINDER SPEAK AND NOW MRS FARRINDER WOULDN'T SPEAK
AND WHERE IN CAMBRIDGE DO HER FAMILY LIVE OH IT'S ON ONE OF THOSE LITTLE STREETS THAT DON'T SEEM TO HAVE VERY MUCH OF A NAME
VI OH THANK YOU SAID MISS BIRDSEYE I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO LOSE IT
WELL THEN IF YOU MUST EXHIBIT HER TO THE MULTITUDE BRING HER ON TO NEW YORK HE SAID WITH THE SAME ATTEMPT AT A LIGHT TREATMENT
THEY WENT AWAY ASSENTING TO MRS TARRANT'S LAST REMARK
SHE WAS MORE MAJESTIC THAN FACETIOUS
THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS THINKING OF NOW WHETHER HE HAD BETTER TAKE A HALL RIGHT AWAY SO THAT VERENA MIGHT LEAP AT A BOUND INTO RENOWN OR WAIT TILL SHE HAD MADE A FEW MORE APPEARANCES IN PRIVATE SO THAT CURIOSITY MIGHT BE WORKED UP
THE GENERAL HARD COLD VOID OF THE PROSPECT
I ONLY WANT YOU TO LET THIS INCIDENT PASS--TO SAY NOTHING WELL I NEVER DID ANYTHING OF THAT KIND OF WHAT KIND RANSOM WAS HALF VEXED HALF TOUCHED BY HER INABILITY TO ENTER INTO HIS POINT OF VIEW AND HER RESISTANCE MADE HIM HOLD TO HIS IDEA THE MORE
OF COURSE IT GETS ME AWAY
A YEAR'S RESIDENCE IN THAT QUARTER OF THE GLOBE WOULD BE HIGHLY AGREEABLE TO VERENA AND MIGHT EVEN CONTRIBUTE TO THE EVOLUTION OF HER GENIUS
NOTHING LESS THAN THIS WOULD REALLY HAVE SATISFIED SELAH TARRANT
SHE TOOK THE GREATEST INTEREST IN THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN
BUT THIS TOO PROVED A BRIEF ILLUSION
THAT'S THE WAY I MUST LIVE NOW YOUR WORK OLIVE REPEATED NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING
FOR THE IDEA OF A MEDDLING LEGISLATION ON THIS SUBJECT FILLED HIM WITH RAGE
CAUSING CERTAIN LAWS TO BE REPEALED BY CONGRESS AND BY THE STATE LEGISLATURES AND OTHERS TO BE ENACTED SHE REPEATED THE WORDS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PART OF A CATECHISM COMMITTED TO MEMORY WHILE OLIVE SAW THAT THIS MECHANICAL TONE WAS IN THE NATURE OF A JOKE THAT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF
DO YOU FLEE BEFORE THE INDIVIDUAL MALE AND HE TURNED TO VERENA
THESE WERE THE ONLY REMARKS THAT PASSED IN REFERENCE TO THE GREAT SUBJECT
MISS BIRDSEYE WILL CONVERT ME SAID RANSOM WITH INTENTION
THOUGH SHE WAS PERFECTLY MINDFUL THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM NO ENCOURAGEMENT AT THE MOMENT THEY SEPARATED
POOR MISS TARRANT IF SHE THINKS SHE MADE AN IMPRESSION ON YOU SHE WON'T THINK ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THAT IF HER MIND HAS BEEN FORMED BY YOUR SISTER RANSOM SAID
AFTER SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE HE MIGHT OF COURSE CONFESS TO HER THAT HE WAS TOO POOR TO MARRY FOR IN THAT RELATION EVEN A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE HIGHEST TONE MUST SOMETIMES UNBEND
BY NINE O'CLOCK TWENTY OTHER PERSONS HAD ARRIVED AND HAD PLACED THEMSELVES IN THE CHAIRS THAT WERE RANGED ALONG THE SIDES OF THE LONG BALD ROOM IN WHICH THEY ENDED BY PRODUCING THE SIMILITUDE OF AN ENORMOUS STREET-CAR
BUT HE WAS AT A PASS IN WHICH IT WAS PERMISSIBLE TO STRAIN A POINT AND HE TOOK HIS WAY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE KNEW THAT CAMBRIDGE LAY REMEMBERING THAT MISS TARRANT'S INVITATION HAD REFERENCE TO THAT QUARTER AND THAT MRS LUNA HAD GIVEN HIM FURTHER EVIDENCE
THEY WERE INCALCULABLE PHENOMENA ANYWAY AS SELAH WOULD HAVE SAID
TO OLIVE IT APPEARED THAT MR BURRAGE AND MR GRACIE HAD CEASED TO BE JOCULAR
SHE GOT HER SUPPER AT A BOARDING-TABLE ABOUT TWO BLOCKS OFF
SHOULD HE NOT BE ABLE TO ACT IN THAT WAY UPON THE PUBLIC OPINION OF HIS TIME TO CHECK CERTAIN TENDENCIES TO POINT OUT CERTAIN DANGERS TO INDULGE IN MUCH SALUTARY CRITICISM
THE WAY HE SPOKE TOLD HER THAT IT WAS NO WONDER HE HAD FOUGHT ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN HIS SYSTEM OR DISBELIEVE IN IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
WHEN THE TWO YOUNG MEN FROM THE COLLEGE PRESSED THEIR PETITION SHE ASKED WITH A LAUGH THAT SURPRISED THEM WHETHER THEY WISHED TO MOCK AND MUDDLE HER
CIVILISATION UNDER SUCH AN INFLUENCE IN SUCH A SETTING APPEARED TO HAVE DONE ITS WORK
MRS LUNA HAD A WAY OF BEING PRESENT AT HIS LESSONS AND WHEN THEY PASSED AS SOONER OR LATER THEY WERE SURE TO INTO THE STAGE I HAVE DESCRIBED SHE INTERCEDED FOR HER OVERWROUGHT DARLING REMINDED RANSOM THAT THESE WERE THE SIGNS OF AN EXQUISITE SENSIBILITY BEGGED THAT THE CHILD MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REST A LITTLE AND SPENT THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME IN CONVERSATION WITH THE PRECEPTOR
A LECTURE IN THE MUSIC HALL AT FIFTY CENTS A TICKET WITHOUT HER FATHER RIGHT THERE ON HER OWN BASIS
SHE PROCEEDED SLOWLY CAUTIOUSLY AS IF SHE WERE LISTENING FOR THE PROMPTER CATCHING ONE BY ONE CERTAIN PHRASES THAT WERE WHISPERED TO HER A GREAT DISTANCE OFF BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE WORLD
HE DETERMINED TO TREAT THE INTERVAL AS A HOLIDAY AND HE WONDERED WHAT ONE COULD DO IN BOSTON TO GIVE ONE'S MORNING A FESTIVE COMPLEXION
THE WESTERN WINDOWS OF OLIVE'S DRAWING-ROOM LOOKING OVER THE WATER TOOK IN THE RED SUNSETS OF WINTER
I REMEMBER YOUR BEING IMMENSELY EXCITED ABOUT HER THAT TIME YOU MET HER
THIS INTERVIEW WHICH HAD SOME CURIOUS FEATURES WOULD BE WORTH DESCRIBING BUT I AM FORBIDDEN TO DO MORE THAN MENTION THE MOST STRIKING OF THESE
HE WAS AN OBJECT OF EXTREME ADMIRATION TO SELAH TARRANT WHO BELIEVED THAT HE HAD MASTERED ALL THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS AND WHO WHEN MRS TARRANT REMARKED AS SHE HAD DONE MORE THAN ONCE THAT IT LOOKED AS IF MR PARDON WAS REALLY COMING AFTER VERENA DECLARED THAT IF HE WAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW YOUNG MEN HE SHOULD WANT TO SEE IN THAT CONNEXION ONE OF THE FEW HE SHOULD BE WILLING TO ALLOW TO HANDLE HER
YOU ARE VERY REMARKABLE
OLIVE STOPPED AND STOOD THERE HESITATING
HE WANTED TO SHOW THEM TO HER HE WAS SO SURE SHE WOULD ADMIRE THEM
HOW LONG DID SHE EXPECT A HUMBLE ADMIRER TO WAIT
SHE DISAPPROVED COMPLETELY OF DOCTOR TARRANT'S LITTLE SPEECH AND SHE HAD LESS AND LESS DISPOSITION TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A MIRACLE-MONGER
THEY DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT FEMALE SUFFRAGE
PROMISE ME NOT TO MARRY!"--THAT WAS WHAT ECHOED IN HER STARTLED MIND AND REPEATED ITSELF THERE WHEN MR BURRAGE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE ASKING HER IF SHE WOULDN'T AT LEAST APPOINT SOME EVENING WHEN THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO HER
I AM AFRAID YOU'LL THINK WE'RE TOO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH ALL THESE NEW HOPES
NEVERTHELESS TO MAKE SURE SHE WOULD JUST ASK VERENA WHETHER SHE DISAPPROVED OF IT
THIS HAD SO LONG BEEN RANSOM'S CONVICTION THAT HIS HEART QUITE WARMED TO DOCTOR PRANCE AND HE PAID HOMAGE TO HER WISDOM IN THE MANNER OF MISSISSIPPI--WITH A RICHNESS OF COMPLIMENT THAT MADE HER TURN HER ACUTE SUSPICIOUS EYE UPON HIM
THEY WERE ALL ONLY TOO MUCH IN SYMPATHY
SHE WAS SO STRANGE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE GIRLS ONE USUALLY MET SEEMED TO BELONG TO SOME QUEER GIPSY-LAND OR TRANSCENDENTAL BOHEMIA
THE FURTHEST HE HAD GONE AS YET WAS TO TELL HER THAT HE LIKED HER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT HE LIKED OLD ENAMELS AND OLD EMBROIDERIES
I REMEMBER YOU NOW AND OLIVE BRINGING YOU
BUT IT SEEMED ALMOST A MOCKERY WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CAMBRIDGE WHERE THE BOARDS WERE LOOSE IN THE STEPS OF THE PORCH
VERENA FOR OLIVE WAS THE VERY TYPE AND MODEL OF THE GIFTED BEING
A FACT TO BE EXPLAINED BY A REFERENCE TO THAT RECENT PERIOD OF EXILE IN THE WEST OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD A HINT AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE PRESENT OCCASION MAY HAVE SEEMED TO HER A RETURN TO INTELLECTUAL LIFE
IF ANY QUESTION HAD BEEN OPENED I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO STAY BUT I PRESUME YOU DON'T PROPOSE TO RETIRE WELL I'VE GOT TO PURSUE MY STUDIES SOME TIME
I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR FATHER OLIVE CHANCELLOR REJOINED VERY GRAVELY WITH A GREAT AIR OF SECURITY
SHE SAID SHE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF VERENA'S VIEWS AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THEM THAN SHE HERSELF
SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH EVERY KIND OF CURE AND HAD GROWN UP AMONG LADY-EDITORS OF NEWSPAPERS ADVOCATING NEW RELIGIONS AND PEOPLE WHO DISAPPROVED OF THE MARRIAGE-TIE
BESIDES I AM FAMILIAR WITH MRS FARRINDER'S SYSTEM
IT WAS THE SAME SORT OF IMPULSE THAT HAD MOVED HER TO WRITE TO BASIL RANSOM IN THE SPRING AFTER HEARING ACCIDENTALLY THAT HE HAD COME TO THE NORTH AND INTENDED IN NEW YORK TO PRACTISE HIS PROFESSION
SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO ASK OLIVE WHETHER TASTE AND ART WERE NOT SOMETHING AND HER FRIEND COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE PHASE
IF MRS FARRINDER COULD BE INDUCED TO WRITE AN OPEN LETTER ABOUT VERENA THAT WOULD DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
ALL SHE COULD SAY WAS SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE LAYING HIS HANDS ON ANY OF HER FOLKS
FOR YOU HAVE SPOKEN FOR US GIRLS JUST AS MUCH AS--JUST AS MUCH AS SHE HESITATED NOW LOOKING ABOUT WITH ENTHUSIASTIC EYES AT THE REST OF THE GROUP AND MEETING ONCE MORE THE GAZE OF BASIL RANSOM
HARMONY RULED THE SCENE
BUT SHE DIDN'T SEE WHY IT WASN'T ENOUGH WHEN YOU MADE YOURSELF AS PLEASANT AS THAT
I WANT TO HELP THE LADIES THE LADIES OLIVE MURMURED
THEY READ A GREAT DEAL OF HISTORY TOGETHER AND READ IT EVER WITH THE SAME THOUGHT--THAT OF FINDING CONFIRMATION IN IT FOR THIS IDEA THAT THEIR SEX HAD SUFFERED INEXPRESSIBLY AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS THE STATE OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH LESS HORRIBLE HISTORY SEEMED TO THEM IN EVERY WAY HORRIBLE IF WOMEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO PRESS DOWN THE SCALE
I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE NEWTON TOO
VERENA OF COURSE PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE WHICH WAS INADEQUATELY EXPLAINED BY THE THEORY OF A SUDDEN INCREASE OF HER FATHER'S PRACTICE NOTHING OF HER FATHER'S HAD EVER INCREASED LIKE THAT AND ENDED BY GUESSING THE CAUSE OF IT--A DISCOVERY WHICH DID NOT IN THE LEAST DISTURB HER EQUANIMITY
SHE FELT THAT THERE WERE REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD CARE
THESE HOWEVER WERE DOUBTLESS THE NORMAL PROCEEDINGS OF WOMEN
IF THEY HAD GONE TOGETHER IN THE COMMON WAY SHE WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO OWE IT TO HIM THAT SHE SHOULD BE SO DARING AND HE BELONGED TO A SEX TO WHICH SHE WISHED TO BE UNDER NO OBLIGATIONS
THERE WAS ALWAYS A LARGER ONE IN FAVOUR OF HIS POWER TO PENETRATE AND OF THE MAJESTY OF THE GREAT DAILIES INDEED HE TOOK SO MANY THINGS FOR GRANTED THAT OLIVE REMAINED DUMB WHILE SHE REGARDED THEM
ABOUT CHRISTMAS A STEP WAS TAKEN WHICH ADVANCED HER AFFAIRS IMMENSELY AND PUT THEM TO HER APPREHENSION ON A REGULAR FOOTING
HER FATHER WAS DREADFULLY SLACK AND THE WINTER WAS EBBING AWAY
DON'T THINK ME CAPRICIOUS IF I SAY I WOULD RATHER TRUST YOU WITHOUT A PLEDGE
IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ILLUSTRATED IT BY THEIR TALK BY ALL THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH AND ALL THEY COULD TELL A YOUNGER SISTER
HIS WIFE WAS A DAUGHTER OF ABRAHAM GREENSTREET
WHY POOR OLD LADY--SHE MUST BE QUITE MATURE IT WAS THEREFORE WITH SOME SEVERITY THAT SHE REJOINED
HE HAD LENT HIMSELF GOOD-NATUREDLY TO THIS DESIRE--HE WAS TOUCHED BY SO MUCH CONFIDENCE--BUT THE EXPERIMENT HAD SPEEDILY COLLAPSED
BUT I'VE HEARD HER ON THE PLATFORM
OH NO
THAT IS PARTLY WHY HE PAUSED THERE
I KNOW NOT WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE REALITY OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S OTHER PREMONITIONS BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IN THIS RESPECT SHE TOOK VERENA'S MEASURE ON THE SPOT
SHE WAS THE ONLY PURE SPIRIT IN THE ODIOUS GROUP
FOR BEFORE THAT HER BEST HOURS HAD BEEN SPENT IN FANCYING THAT SHE WAS HELPING SOME SOUTHERN SLAVE TO ESCAPE
WELL YOU ARE CONSIDERATE AND MISS BIRDSEYE CONTINUED TO GAZE AT HIM
XIX THIS IDEA OF THEIR TRIUMPH A TRIUMPH AS YET ULTIMATE AND REMOTE BUT PRECEDED BY THE SOLEMN VISTA OF AN EFFORT SO RELIGIOUS AS NEVER TO BE WANTING IN ECSTASY BECAME TREMENDOUSLY FAMILIAR TO THE TWO FRIENDS BUT ESPECIALLY TO OLIVE DURING THE WINTER OF 187 A SEASON WHICH USHERED IN THE MOST MOMENTOUS PERIOD OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S LIFE
AS A GENERAL THING MOREOVER THE PRACTICE WAS CONFINED TO THE DECOROUS
RANSOM SAT FOR HOURS IN HIS OFFICE WAITING FOR CLIENTS WHO EITHER DID NOT COME OR IF THEY DID COME DID NOT SEEM TO FIND HIM ENCOURAGING AS THEY USUALLY LEFT HIM WITH THE REMARK THAT THEY WOULD THINK WHAT THEY WOULD DO
IT'S INSPIRATIONAL MISS BIRDSEYE GAVE A SMALL VAGUE UNSCEPTICAL LAUGH
THE DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR TARRANT THE MESMERIC HEALER--MISS VERENA
SHE HAD DECIDED THAT SHE HAD A PRETEXT
BUT SHE PROPOSED TO HERSELF NOT TO MIND THAT
NEVERTHELESS IT WOULD REPRESENT A REALITY IF ONE WERE TO SAY THAT BY DISTINCTION THE CHANCELLORS BELONGED TO THE BOURGEOISIE_--THE OLDEST AND BEST
THE MOST SECRET THE MOST SACRED HOPE OF HER NATURE WAS THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY HAVE SUCH A CHANCE THAT SHE MIGHT BE A MARTYR AND DIE FOR SOMETHING
WHEREVER WE ARE IT'S ALL YOU
MOSELEY IN MEMORY OF A GREAT PRECURSOR WHOM THEY ALL REVERENCED AND NOW THE INSPIRATION IF HE MIGHT CALL IT SO SEEMED JUST TO FLOW IN THAT CHANNEL
AND SO HE PASSED FROM MISS CHANCELLOR'S SIGHT
SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST GO
IT WAS AFFIRMED WITHIN RANSOM'S HEARING THAT IF THEY HAD A FEW MORE LIKE THAT THE MATTER WOULD SOON BE FIXED
OH NO I NEVER DIFFER FROM NEWTON AND MRS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HAPPIER IF THE MOVEMENTS SHE WAS INTERESTED IN COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON ONLY BY THE PEOPLE SHE LIKED AND IF REVOLUTIONS SOMEHOW DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BEGIN WITH ONE'S SELF--WITH INTERNAL CONVULSIONS SACRIFICES EXECUTIONS
THEN FOR ALL ANSWER SHE MURMURED IRRESOLUTELY I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME HELP YOU YET IT SEEMED AT THE SAME TIME THAT VERENA NEEDED LITTLE HELP FOR IT WAS MORE AND MORE CLEAR THAT HER ELOQUENCE WHEN SHE STOOD UP THAT WAY BEFORE A ROOMFUL OF PEOPLE WAS LITERALLY INSPIRATION
IT WAS NOT THE WAY TO STAND OUT SO VERY MUCH EITHER SELAH TARRANT FELT
MRS FARRINDER GOES EVERYWHERE
I LIKE OPPOSITION VERENA EXCLAIMED WITH A HAPPY SMILE
THEY MADE HER PERCEIVE EVERYTHING FROM WHICH SHE SHOULD HAVE RESCUED HER
HE ASKED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT WHY HE SHOULDN'T RING THE BELL AND OBTAIN HIS NEEDED INFORMATION FROM THE SERVANT WHO WOULD BE SURE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT TO HIM
HE LOOKED WITH LONGING FOR THE MOMENT WHEN VERENA SHOULD BE ADVERTISED AMONG THE PERSONALS AND TO HIS MIND THE SUPREMELY HAPPY PEOPLE WERE THOSE AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THEM OF WHOM THERE WAS SOME JOURNALISTIC MENTION EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR
IT WAS HER BELIEF THAT HE WAS PLAYING A DEEPER GAME THAN THE YOUNG MATTHIAS AND SHE WAS VERY WILLING TO WATCH HIM
I AM NOT THE LEAST AFRAID OF YOUR MARRYING A REPULSIVE MAN
A FACT WHICH IN HER HEART VERENA REGARDED AS FORTUNATE INASMUCH AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF IF HER MOTHER RETURNING FROM CHARLES STREET BEGAN TO EXPLAIN MISS CHANCELLOR TO HER WITH FRESH ENERGY AND AS IF SHE VERENA HAD NEVER SEEN HER AND UP TO THIS TIME THEY HAD HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT HER TO WHAT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE SAME SORT WOULD NOT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ADELINE HAVE GIVEN RISE
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN SHE SAID
IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER TO ABANDON THE STRUGGLE TO LEAVE ALL THE UNHAPPY WOMEN OF THE WORLD TO THEIR IMMEMORIAL MISERY TO LAY DOWN ONE'S BURDEN CLOSE ONE'S EYES TO THE WHOLE DARK PICTURE AND IN SHORT SIMPLY EXPIRE
IT WAS PASSIONATE TOO AND IT PUT FORTH A BEAUTIFUL ENERGY
BUT IF THE WAY MISS CHANCELLOR HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HER DIDN'T SHOW THAT SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD ROUSE THE PEOPLE MRS TARRANT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT SHOWED
HER KEEN EYE SPARKLED THERE WAS A FLUSH ON HER MATRONLY CHEEK AND SHE HAD EVIDENTLY MADE UP HER MIND WHAT LINE TO TAKE
IF IT WASN'T A POWER IT COULDN'T DO MUCH WITH ME YOU ARE SO SIMPLE--SO MUCH LIKE A CHILD OLIVE CHANCELLOR SAID
HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE SUPPOSED THE GIRL WOULD COME OUT IN PUBLIC--WOULD GO ABOUT LIKE MRS FARRINDER
AT THE SAME TIME SHE ASKED THE MEANING OF THE GERMAN WORDS
DON'T ALL THE TROUBLE OF HUMANITY COME FROM OUR BEING PRESSED BACK
WAS IT INTEREST THAT PROMPTED HER MOTHER TO RESPOND SO WARMLY TO MISS CHANCELLOR TO SAY TO VERENA WITH AN AIR OF KNOWINGNESS THAT THE THING TO DO WAS TO GO IN AND SEE HER IMMEDIATELY
WHEREUPON OLIVE INSISTED WILL YOU COME VERY SOON AND VERENA SAID OH YES SHE WOULD COME VERY SOON AND REPEATED THE NUMBER IN CHARLES STREET TO SHOW THAT SHE HAD TAKEN HEED OF IT
HE HAD ALREADY TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE MUST COUNT WITH IT
SHE HERSELF WAS NOTHING OF A SYBARITE AND SHE HAD PROVED VISITING THE ALLEYS AND SLUMS OF BOSTON IN THE SERVICE OF THE ASSOCIATED CHARITIES THAT THERE WAS NO FOULNESS OF DISEASE OR MISERY SHE FEARED TO LOOK IN THE FACE
OLIVE HAD HAD AN APPREHENSION THAT SHE WOULD FLUSH A LITTLE AT LEARNING THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR CAREER TOGETHER
OLIVE IN FACT HAD REMAINED VIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF HER KINSMAN'S ISOLATION UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN MRS FARRINDER LIFTED HER WITH A WORD TO A HIGHER PLANE
SHE HAD HOWEVER A MORAL RESOURCE THAT SHE COULD ALWAYS FALL BACK UPON
RANSOM ASKED HER IF SHE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE LIONESS AND ON HER STARING AT HIM WITHOUT RESPONSE EXPLAINED THAT HE MEANT THE RENOWNED MRS FARRINDER
IT SEEMS AS IF DOCTOR TARRANT COULDN'T REMEMBER TO GO FOR THE MAN TO FIX IT
MATTHIAS PARDON IT WAS TO BE SUPPOSED HAD RECEIVED TEMPORARILY AT LEAST HIS QUIETUS
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF MRS FARRINDER DIDN'T WANT TO EXPRESS SOME ACKNOWLEDGMENT ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY AT LARGE FOR THE REAL STIMULUS MISS TARRANT HAD GIVEN THEM
SUCH WERE THE IMAGES THAT PROCEEDED FROM OLIVE'S RICH MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS
I SHOULD BE SO HAPPY TO ANSWER HIM SAID MRS FARRINDER WITH SUPREME SOFTNESS
BUT IT ISN'T THE SAME SHE SAID
SHE MADE HIM SIT DOWN
THEN SHE SAID
IT WAS ABOUT THEIR EQUALITY--PERHAPS EVEN HE WAS NOT DEFINITELY CONSCIOUS ABOUT THEIR SUPERIORITY
BASIL RANSOM UNDERSTOOD STILL LESS AND IT WAS A MELANCHOLY COMMENTARY ON HIS CONTENTION THAT MEN ARE NOT INFERIOR THAT THIS MEETING COULD NOT COME HOWEVER RAPIDLY TO A CLOSE WITHOUT HIS PLUNGING INTO A BLUNDER WHICH NECESSARILY AGGRAVATED THOSE HE HAD ALREADY MADE
DURING THESE PAROXYSMS HE KICKED FURIOUSLY AT EVERY ONE AND EVERYTHING--AT POOR RANNIE AT HIS MOTHER AT MESSRS
HE HAD TOLD MISS BIRDSEYE WHAT HE WOULD LIKE AND SHE SEEMED TO THINK FROM THE WAY THEIR CELEBRATED FRIEND HAD BEEN AFFECTED THAT THE IDEA MIGHT TAKE HER SOME DAY OF JUST LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW ALL SHE HAD FELT
IF SHE HAD PRODUCED A PAIR OF CASTANETS OR A TAMBOURINE HE FELT THAT SUCH ACCESSORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN KEEPING
WHEN I DINE OUT I USUALLY CARRY A SIX-SHOOTER AND A BOWIE-KNIFE AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY--A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
IT WAS HER BELIEF THAT SHE FILLED HER TEA-POT WITH THE SPOON OF HOSPITALITY AND MADE A GOOD MANY SELECT SPIRITS FEEL THAT THEY WERE WELCOME UNDER HER ROOF AT CONVENIENT HOURS
BESIDES SHE WAS HELD BY HOSPITALITY THE VISION OF NEW SOCIAL HORIZONS THE SENSE OF NOVELTY AND THE LOVE OF CHANGE
WHEN VERENA AT LAST SAID TO HER FRIEND THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO COME OUT TO CAMBRIDGE--SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DIDN'T--OLIVE EXPRESSED HER REASONS VERY FRANKLY ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS JEALOUS THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO THINK OF THE GIRL'S BELONGING TO ANY ONE BUT HERSELF
EXCEPT HER INTELLIGENT EYE SHE HAD NO FEATURES TO SPEAK OF
HIS GUESTS SAT SCATTERED IN THE RED FIRELIGHT LISTENING SILENT IN COMFORTABLE ATTITUDES
THE PITY THEY FELT FOR HER WAS PART OF THEIR PITY FOR ALL WHO WERE WEAKEST AND MOST HARDLY USED
HE IS A NOBLE LITTLE NATURE AND I WANT SOME ADVICE ABOUT HIM
YES SHE WILL BRING YOU ROUND I WILL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS SHE DOES BASIL RANSOM SAID
VERENA TARRANT SAW THAT SHE WAS THE OBJECT OF THIS MANIFESTATION AND SHE GOT UP TO MEET THE LADY WHOSE APPROACH WAS SO FULL OF POINT
MRS TARRANT TOO IN HER OWN HOUSE BECAME NOW A COMPLETE FIGURE
I WOULD CHANGE MY POSITION FOR YOURS ANY DAY HE WENT ON
SEVERAL OF THE LADIES DECLARED THAT THEY SHOULD BE DELIGHTED--THEY HOPED THAT MISS TARRANT WAS IN GOOD TRIM
AND DID SHE BRING HER BACK GRACIOUS YOU DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD LEAVE HER
IT SEEMED TO HIM AT PRESENT THAT THE FRUITFUL TIME WAS NOT FAR OFF
SHE HAD ADDRESSED SO MANY ASSEMBLIES AND SHE WANTED TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAD TO SAY
OF COURSE IT WAS EASY TO PROVE TO HER NOW THAT MR PARDON'S GLITTERING BAIT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
THE FINE WEB OF AUTHORITY OF DEPENDENCE THAT HER STRENUOUS COMPANION HAD WOVEN ABOUT HER WAS NOW AS DENSE AS A SUIT OF GOLDEN MAIL
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER TO ASK HERSELF WHY MISS CHANCELLOR DIDN'T TALK TO HIM SINCE SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM
I MUST STAY WITH MY FATHER AND MOTHER SHE SAID
AND VERENA FOR THE NEXT MONTH TOOK HER WAY VERY OFTEN TO CHARLES STREET
THERE WAS ONE THING HE TRUSTED HE ALWAYS KEPT CLEAR OF
THE PARTY AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID I CANNOT PRETEND THAT HIS SPEECH WAS TOO HEROIC FOR THAT FOR WHOM HE HAD TRANSACTED BUSINESS IN BOSTON SO MANY MONTHS BEFORE AND WHO HAD EXPRESSED AT THE TIME BUT A LIMITED APPRECIATION OF HIS SERVICES THERE HAD BEEN BETWEEN THE LAWYER AND HIS CLIENT A DIVERGENCE OF JUDGEMENT OBSERVING APPARENTLY THAT THEY PROVED MORE FRUITFUL THAN HE EXPECTED HAD REOPENED THE AFFAIR AND PRESENTLY REQUESTED RANSOM TO TRANSPORT HIMSELF AGAIN TO THE SISTER CITY
SHE'S VISITING HER HOME I THOUGHT HER HOME WAS IN CHARLES STREET WELL NO
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A FIT THE SIGHT OF HIS LONG MISSISSIPPIAN PERSON WOULD GIVE HER AND IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM THAT HE SHOULD WISH SO TO SPARE THE SENSIBILITIES OF A YOUNG LADY WHOM HE HAD NOT FOUND TENDER
I AM OF THE OPINION OF THAT HISTORICAL CHARACTER--WASN'T HE SOME KING?--WHO THOUGHT THERE WAS A LADY BEHIND EVERYTHING
THESE GENTLEMEN WILL CARRY THE NEWS
THIS WAS IN FACT VERY MUCH WHAT HE HAD SUPPOSED BOSTON TO BE
I HAVE WANTED TO KNOW YOU
SHE IS THE EXPLANATION
SHE CARRIED OUT THIS RESOLVE ON WHICH SHE HAD BESTOWED INFINITE CONSIDERATION INDEPENDENTLY OF VERENA
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS I FEEL--IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I HAD BEEN BORN TO FEEL THEM
SHE HAD NOT MADE HIM A SCENE THERE HAD BEEN NO QUESTION OF AN EXPLANATION
BUT THEY HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST DAYS FOR WHEN CAUSES WERE EMBODIED IN FOREIGNERS WHAT ELSE WERE THE AFRICANS THEY WERE CERTAINLY MORE APPEALING
ALL THE BULLIED WIVES THE STRICKEN MOTHERS THE DISHONOURED DESERTED MAIDENS WHO HAVE LIVED ON THE EARTH AND LONGED TO LEAVE IT PASSED AND REPASSED BEFORE HER EYES AND THE INTERMINABLE DIM PROCESSION SEEMED TO STRETCH OUT A MYRIAD HANDS TO HER
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND MY FRIEND OF FRIENDS BEYOND EVERY ONE EVERYTHING FOR EVER AND FOR EVER HER FACE WAS FULL OF EAGERNESS AND TENDERNESS
OLIVE SAW VERENA LAVISH HER SMILES ON MR GRACIE AND MR BURRAGE
AH I BESEECH YOU GIVE US THE WHOLE PROGRAMME--DON'T OMIT ANY LEADING FEATURE MR BURRAGE WAS HEARD TO PLEAD
HER NAME WAS ABSENT HOWEVER AND THIS RESOURCE SEEMED TO MOCK HIM
THIS SENSE OF PERSONAL LOSS AS I HAVE CALLED IT MADE HIM FEEL FURTHER THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO MAKE UP TO RECOVER
THIS REFLEXION OVERTOOK HIM JUST AS HE REACHED OLIVE'S HOUSE WHICH ODDLY ENOUGH HE WAS OBLIGED TO PASS ON HIS WAY TO THE MYSTERIOUS SUBURB
THE TOILERS AND SPINNERS THE VERY OBSCURE THESE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE SAFE FROM IT
YOU MEAN FOR THE OTHER SLAVES HE EXCLAIMED WITH A LAUGH
SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY PRETTY
IF YOU THINK SHE IS NOT SINCERE YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
IF OLIVE DESIRED TO GET VERENA INTO TRAINING SHE COULD FLATTER HERSELF THAT THE PROCESS HAD ALREADY BEGUN AND THAT HER COLLEAGUE ENJOYED IT ALMOST AS MUCH AS SHE
HOW CAN I FAIL YOU CAN'T OF COURSE YOU CAN'T
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ME
OF THAT KIND INDEED!--THE PHRASE REVERBERATED IN MISS CHANCELLOR'S RESENTFUL SOUL
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKENED TO A THIN RAY OF MOONLIGHT RESTING UPON THE WALL OF A PRISON
DO YOU MEAN YOUR VOTING AND PREACHING AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING HE MADE THIS INQUIRY BUT SEEING HOW SERIOUSLY SHE WOULD TAKE HIS ANSWER HE WAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED AND HUNG FIRE
OH A PLAGUE ON YOUR BUSINESS
ONCE ONLY IN THE COURSE OF HIS SUBSEQUENT ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER DID IT FIND A VOICE
MRS BURRAGE LOOKED AT HER SON AND LAUGHED
THERE'S A LITTLE HOLE RIGHT THERE IN THE PORCH
WHY IS IT GOING TO BE A SPIRITUAL SEANCE BASIL RANSOM ASKED
HE TOLD MR GRACIE THAT'S THE LITTLE ONE THAT HE FELT AS IF HE MUST
WHOSE LONGING FOR THE NEW DAY HAD SUCH PERVERSITIES OF PESSIMISM AND WHO IN THE MIDST OF SOMETHING THAT APPEARED TO BE TERRIBLY SEARCHING IN HER HONESTY WAS WILLING TO CORRUPT HIM AS A FATHER WITH THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT ORDERS ON HER BANK
PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T AGREE SHE ADDED RESTING HER STRANGE EYES ON HIM
THE YOUNG COUPLE HE WAS CONSIDERABLY HER ELDER HAD GAZED ON THE FUTURE TOGETHER UNTIL THEY FOUND THAT THE PAST HAD COMPLETELY FORSAKEN THEM AND THAT THE PRESENT OFFERED BUT A SLENDER FOOTHOLD
THIS WAS VERY VISIBLE WHEN OLIVE ASKED HER WHERE SHE HAD GOT HER INTENSE REALISATION OF THE SUFFERING OF WOMEN
MISS BIRDSEYE KNEW THAT HER USES WERE ENDED
IN ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WAS SUSPENDED A FLY-BLOWN CARD WITH THE WORDS TABLE BOARD AFFIXED IN LETTERS CUT NOT VERY NEATLY OUT OF COLOURED PAPER OF GRADUATED TINTS AND SURROUNDED WITH A SMALL BAND OF STAMPED GILT
OLIVE OF COURSE REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS THAT IT HAD NOT LITERALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION
BUT IT REPRESENTED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SHARED EVEN DIMLY AND REMOTELY IN AN EVENT WHICH CONCERNED HER VERY CLOSELY
THAT WAS HER QUALITY HER DESTINY
CERTAIN YOUNG LADIES DISTINGUISHED THE PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS
HE HOPED SHE HADN'T BROKEN DOWN
HE HAD A PASSIONATE TENDERNESS FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY AND A SENSE OF INTIMATE CONNEXION WITH IT WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TAKE A ROOMFUL OF NORTHERN FANATICS INTO HIS CONFIDENCE AS TO READ ALOUD HIS MOTHER'S OR HIS MISTRESS'S LETTERS
SHE OUGHTN'T TO BECOME LIKE THE OTHERS
IT BELONGED TO THE WORLD OF INVITATIONS IN WHICH SHE HAD HAD SO LITTLE SHARE
SHE HAD A HUSBAND AND HIS NAME WAS AMARIAH
WHEREUPON DOCTOR PRANCE REJOINED WELL I GUESS SHE'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT SHE APPEARED TO REGRET HER OWN HALF-DOLLAR AND TO BE VAGUELY IMPATIENT OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF HER SEX
HE PRETENDED AS I HAVE INTIMATED NOT TO NOTICE THIS
HE DID NOT PICK UP HIS HAT TO GO
FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHERS THAT KNEW HOW TO MAKE AS LITTLE MONEY AS SHE WOULD
HOW COULD I SEE HER
A BOSTONIAN COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT ONE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW AND THAT WAS THEIR IDEA OF INGRATIATING THEMSELVES OR AT ANY RATE IT WAS HIS POOR MAN
YOU MUST BE SAFE VERENA--YOU MUST BE SAVED
VERENA WISHED TO PLEASE HER IF ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH A DREAD OF DISPLEASING HER
SHE FELT THAT EVERY ONE PRESENT WAS LOOKING AT HER--VERENA MOST OF ALL--AND THAT HERE WAS A CHANCE TO TAKE A MORE COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE GIRL
THEN HE SAID
SELAH TARRANT HAD EFFECTED WONDERFUL CURES
SUCH POSTS OF OBSERVATION COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE GROCERY ON THE CORNER OF THE RELAXED AND DISJOINTED ROADWAY ENLIVENED AT THE CURBSTONE WITH AN OCCASIONAL ASH-BARREL OR WITH GAS-LAMPS DROOPING FROM THE PERPENDICULAR AND WESTWARD AT THE END OF THE TRUNCATED VISTA OF THE FANTASTIC SKELETON OF THE ELEVATED RAILWAY OVERHANGING THE TRANSVERSE LONGITUDINAL STREET WHICH IT DARKENED AND SMOTHERED WITH THE IMMEASURABLE SPINAL COLUMN AND MYRIAD CLUTCHING PAWS OF AN ANTEDILUVIAN MONSTER
HE HAD EXPECTED MORE OF A PROGRAMME
THE MEN WERE IN THE GARB OF TOIL MANY OF THEM IN WEARY-LOOKING OVERCOATS
IT OCCURRED TO HIM INDEED THAT CAMBRIDGE WAS A BIG PLACE AND THAT HE HAD NO PARTICULAR ADDRESS
THERE IS NOTHING WONDERFUL IN MY BEING GLAD TO SEE YOU MRS LUNA REJOINED WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN THREE LONG WEEKS IN THIS UNPREVARICATING CITY THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
IT TAKES IN MISS VERENA AND IT TAKES IN ALL OTHERS--EXCEPT THE LADY-CORRESPONDENTS THE YOUNG MAN ADDED WITH A JOCOSITY WHICH AS HE PERCEIVED EVEN AT THE MOMENT WAS LOST ON VERENA'S FRIEND
THEN OLIVE EXCLAIMED TO HERSELF IS IT A PLOT
SUPPOSE THIS GLITTERING LAUGHING BURRAGE YOUTH WITH HIS CHAINS AND RINGS AND SHINING SHOES SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER AND TRY TO BRIBE HER WITH HIS GREAT POSSESSIONS TO PRACTISE RENUNCIATIONS OF ANOTHER KIND--TO GIVE UP HER HOLY WORK AND TO GO WITH HIM TO NEW YORK THERE TO LIVE AS HIS WIFE PARTLY BULLIED PARTLY PAMPERED IN THE ACCUSTOMED BURRAGE MANNER
THERE'S A BLUE CAR SHE SAID IN A TONE OF MILD RELIEF
SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN A GREATER PLEASURE
HOW PRETTILY INDEED SHE MADE SOME OF IT SOUND
I WANT TO KNOW YOU OLIVE SAID ON THIS OCCASION
AND THIS VIEW OF THE SITUATION BROUGHT WITH IT A FEELING THAT THEY HAD ALMOST ALREADY BEGUN TO BE A FORCE
DOCTOR TARRANT LOOKED AT NO ONE AS HE STROKED AND SOOTHED HIS DAUGHTER
THEY ARE IN MY EARS IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT AND BEFORE MY FACE IN THE VISIONS OF THE DARKNESS
SHE HAD ALREADY QUITE RECOGNISED HOWEVER THAT IT WAS NOT OF IMPORTANCE THAT VERENA SHOULD BE JUST LIKE HERSELF
IF HIS COUSIN COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN OF THIS TYPE BASIL WOULD HAVE FELT HIMSELF MORE FORTUNATE
AS FOR HER PEOPLE THEY WERE TOO ABSOLUTELY AWFUL
WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY US'--YOUR WHOLE DELIGHTFUL SEX
JUST TWO OR THREE OF YOUR GRAND OLD THOUGHTS BASIL STEPPED NEARER TO HIS COUSIN
SHE ASSURED HIM THAT HER SISTER QUITE EXPECTED HIM WOULD FEEL AS SORRY AS SHE COULD EVER FEEL FOR ANYTHING--FOR SHE WAS A KIND OF FATALIST ANYHOW--IF HE DIDN'T STAY TO DINNER
OLIVE HAD A STANDING QUARREL WITH THE LEVITY THE GOOD-NATURE OF THE JUDGEMENTS OF THE DAY
HER LARGE MILD CHEEKS WERE SHINING WITH UNWIPED TEARS
SHE WAS SITTING OPPOSITE TO HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE
I WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING THAT A HAPPY CHANCE HAD FAVOURED HIM BUT IT OCCURS TO ME THAT ONE IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO CALL CHANCES BY NATTERING EPITHETS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN WAITED FOR SO LONG
ALL THINGS WITH HIM REFERRED THEMSELVES TO PRINT AND PRINT MEANT SIMPLY INFINITE REPORTING A PROMPTITUDE OF ANNOUNCEMENT ABUSIVE WHEN NECESSARY OR EVEN WHEN NOT ABOUT HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS
SHE WAS STRONG AND SUPPLE THERE WAS COLOUR IN HER LIPS AND EYES AND HER TRESSES GATHERED INTO A COMPLICATED COIL SEEMED TO GLOW WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER NATURE
MY ONLY INTEREST IS TO DRAW HER OUT SAID SELAH DEFENDING HIS INTEGRITY
BUT HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION TO HER AS SHE MIGHT SAY
THE LAMP-LIGHT WAS SOFT THE FIRE CRACKLED PLEASANTLY EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDED HIM BETRAYED A WOMAN'S TASTE AND TOUCH
YOU WILL JUST CATCH THE CHARLES STREET CAR THAT YOUNG WOMAN MURMURED WITH MUFFLED SWEETNESS
LEAVING HIM TO MAKE SUCH AN APPLICATION TO HIMSELF AS HIS FANCY MIGHT SUGGEST
I DON'T KNOW
HER YOUNG FRIEND'S REVELATIONS ACTUALLY GAVE HER A VERTIGO
HOW CAN I KNOW
THESE TWO WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM BASIL RANSOM AND DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AND YET THE MANNER OF EACH CONVEYED AN INSULT TO ONE'S WOMANHOOD
SHE SMILED CONSTANTLY AT HER GUEST BUT FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF DINNER THOUGH HE MADE SEVERAL REMARKS THAT HE THOUGHT MIGHT PROVE AMUSING SHE NEVER ONCE LAUGHED
OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO ANSWER IT AND INDEED SHE SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD IT
THIS GENTLEMAN SEEMED TO RESPOND TO AN IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL
MY DEAR CHILD IF YOU'LL TAKE THE FLOOR I'LL CALL THE MEETING TO ORDER SAID MRS FARRINDER
THAT MADE HIM HOVER AT THE EDITORIAL ELBOW
AND HIS IMPRESSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AS A SYMPTOM OF SUPERIORITY WAS NOT DIMINISHED BY THE FACT THAT HE HIMSELF HAD MASTERED THE TONGUE KNOWING IT CONTAINED A LARGE LITERATURE OF JURISPRUDENCE DURING A LONG EMPTY DEADLY SUMMER ON THE PLANTATION
THEY HAD JUST HEARD HER SAY IT IS NOT ME MOTHER AND HE AND MRS TARRANT AND THE GIRL HERSELF WERE ALL EQUALLY AWARE IT WAS NOT SHE
IT HAD DROPPED STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN WITHOUT FILTERING THROUGH HER PARENTS WHOM MISS CHANCELLOR DECIDEDLY DID NOT FANCY
IT WAS BETTER FOR A WINTER'S EVENING THAN THE GERMAN BEER-CELLAR MRS LUNA'S TEA WAS EXCELLENT AND HIS HOSTESS HERSELF APPEARED TO-NIGHT ALMOST AS AMIABLE AS THE VARIETY-ACTRESS
DON'T CARE--DON'T CARE
THAT'S THE MOST ONE CAN BE SURE OF
I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I HAVE HEARD MRS FARRINDER THEY HAD ARRIVED AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN BY MISS CHANCELLOR TO THE COACHMAN AND THEIR VEHICLE STOPPED WITH A LURCH
MISS BIRDSEYE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT MISS CHANCELLOR HAD HAD HERS
IF HE WERE A LITTLE MORE DRY IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR HIM
THEY WATCHED THE STELLAR POINTS COME OUT AT LAST IN A COLDER HEAVEN AND THEN SHUDDERING A LITTLE ARM IN ARM THEY TURNED AWAY WITH A SENSE THAT THE WINTER NIGHT WAS EVEN MORE CRUEL THAN THE TYRANNY OF MEN--TURNED BACK TO DRAWN CURTAINS AND A BRIGHTER FIRE AND A GLITTERING TEA-TRAY AND MORE AND MORE TALK ABOUT THE LONG MARTYRDOM OF WOMEN A SUBJECT AS TO WHICH OLIVE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND REALLY MOST INTERESTING
FIRST SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH HER AND THEN SHE HADN'T
ONE OUTRAGE THE MORE TO THE SEX IN HER PERSON WAS OF LITTLE ACCOUNT
BUT THE NEXT MINUTE HIS SPIRITS ROSE AGAIN FOR HE WAS SURE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE LITTLE OLD LADY BEFORE
HE PROMISED TO LEAVE HER WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE CONSIGNED HER TO THE BLUE CAR
SHE URGED UPON HER COMPANION THE IDEA OF LABOURING IN THE WORLD OF FASHION APPEARED TO ATTRIBUTE TO HER FAMILIAR RELATIONS WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS REALM AND WANTED TO KNOW WHY SHE SHOULDN'T STIR UP SOME OF HER FRIENDS DOWN THERE ON THE MILL-DAM
SHE HAD THE IDEA VIVIDLY THAT WAS THE MARVEL OF THE CRUELTY OF MAN OF HIS IMMEMORIAL INJUSTICE
IT CAME HOME TO HIM THAT HIS OPINIONS WERE STIFF WHEREAS IN COMPARISON HIS EFFORT WAS LAX
HE HAD CARRIED HER THROUGH THINGS WHERE SHE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
IF SHE WAS NOT GOING TO LIKE ME WHY IN THE WORLD DID SHE WRITE TO ME BECAUSE SHE WANTED YOU TO KNOW ME--SHE THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE YOU AND APPARENTLY SHE HAD NOT BEEN WRONG
IT WAS HOWEVER IN HER SOCIAL SUBTLETIES THAT SHE WAS MOST BEYOND HER DAUGHTER
RANSOM WAS ON THE POINT OF REPLYING THAT IT WOULD BE A BETTER WAY THAN ANY OTHER BUT HE CHECKED HIMSELF IN TIME
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE COULD DO TO HER
ADELINE FLITTED IN AND OUT DRESSED FOR DINNERS AND CONCERTS ALWAYS SAYING SOMETHING WORLDLY TO THE YOUNG WOMAN FROM CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING TO OLIVE THAT HAD A FREEDOM WHICH SHE HERSELF WOULD PROBABLY NEVER ARRIVE AT A FAILURE OF FORESIGHT ON VERENA'S PART BUT MISS CHANCELLOR NEVER DETAINED HER NEVER GAVE VERENA A CHANCE TO SEE HER NEVER APPEARED TO IMAGINE THAT SHE COULD HAVE THE LEAST INTEREST IN SUCH A PERSON
OF COURSE A WOMAN WHO HAD HAD THE BAD TASTE TO MARRY SELAH TARRANT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIKELY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO POSSESS A VERY STRAIGHT JUDGEMENT
YOU MUST MOVE THE WORLD WITH IT
SHE IS THE WOMAN IN THE WORLD I SUPPOSE WHO HAS LABOURED MOST FOR EVERY WISE REFORM
SHE KNEW SO MANY PEOPLE--IF THEY WOULD ONLY TRY HIM
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE NARROW BUT SHE THOUGHT A PERSON OUGHT TO KNOW SOMETHING
WHY SHOULD SHE
OLIVE OF COURSE WAS MORE AND MORE HAPPY TO THINK THAT THEIR CAUSE SHOULD HAVE THE SERVICES OF AN ORGANISATION SO RARE
THAT WAS THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE SIDE-WHISKERS AND THE WHITE HAIR
SHE HAD NOT KNOWN THE MEANING OF WHAT SHE SAID
HE ADMITTED THEIR RIGHTS
HE WORE EYE-GLASSES LOOKED UNKEMPT ALMOST RUSTIC AND SAID GOOD THINGS WITH HIS UGLY LIPS
THEREFORE HE WAS FREE TO FEEL ALSO THAT HIS IMAGINATION HAD BEEN RATHER STARVED BY HIS IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NEAR HIM AGAIN COMPARATIVELY THAT SHE WAS IN THE DIMNESS OF THE HORIZON NO LONGER BEYOND THE CURVE OF THE GLOBE AND YET HE HAD NOT PERCEIVED IT
WELL HE IS GREATLY INTERESTED IN OUR MOVEMENT
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HARVARD COLLEGE VERENA RETURNED AS HUMOROUSLY
CAMBRIDGE MOREOVER WAS WORTH SEEING AND IT WAS AS GOOD A WAY AS ANOTHER OF KEEPING HIS HOLIDAY
THE LITTLE KNOT OF REFORMERS WATCHED HER AS SHE ARRIVED
BUT HE HAD AN ODD SENSE OF HAVING LOST SOMETHING IN NOT KNOWING OF THE OTHER GIRL'S APPEARANCE AT THE WOMEN'S CONVENTION--A VAGUE FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN CHEATED AND TRIFLED WITH
THE LATTER COMPRESSED INTO A SMALL SPACE TO BE NEAR HER AND SITTING WITH CLASPED HANDS AND A CONCENTRATION OF INQUIRY WHICH BY CONTRAST MADE MRS FARRINDER'S MANNER SEEM LARGE AND FREE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM OF COURSE
AND OF COURSE I TELL HER I DO FEEL SO FAR AS I REALISE
THEY COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WANTED THEM TO DO AND THEY ALWAYS ENDED BY BEING ODIOUSLY MIXED UP WITH CHARLIE
MR AND MRS TARRANT WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY OPPOSED CLAIMS AND SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SEE THEM TO REMEMBER THAT THEY EXISTED
THE DESOLATE SUBURBAN HORIZONS PEELED AND MADE BALD BY THE RIGOUR OF THE SEASON
DON'T SHUT DOWN THE COVER MISS CHANCELLOR
THAT BRANCH OF THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG LADIES WHICH IS KNOWN AS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT HAD NOT FIGURED AS A DEFINITE HEAD IN MISS TARRANT'S CURRICULUM
JUST LET IT WORK--JUST LET IT GATHER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISTINCTLY WRITTEN
THAT'S THE WAY OLIVE CHANCELLOR TOLD ME YOU TALKED I AM AFRAID SHE HAS TOLD YOU LITTLE GOOD OF ME WELL I AM SURE SHE THINKS SHE IS RIGHT THINKS IT SAID RANSOM
OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE REPLIED IN A BANTERING MANNER IN ANSWER TO HIS INQUIRY
THERE IS SO MUCH SO MUCH
MISS BIRDSEYE HAD GIVEN HER UP
SHE SUPPOSED VERENA WOULD MARRY SOME ONE SOME DAY AND SHE HOPED THE PERSONAGE WOULD BE CONNECTED WITH PUBLIC LIFE--WHICH MEANT FOR MRS TARRANT THAT HIS NAME WOULD BE VISIBLE IN THE LAMP-LIGHT ON A COLOURED POSTER IN THE DOORWAY OF TREMONT TEMPLE
DO YOU REALLY TAKE THE GROUND THAT YOUR SEX HAS BEEN WITHOUT INFLUENCE
AH WELL NOW YOU ARE RECKLESS MRS LUNA REMARKED DRAWING OUT HER RIBBONS BEFORE THE MIRROR
SHE'S THE MOST EMOTIONAL WOMAN I HAVE MET UP TO NOW
BESIDES THAT GIRL TAKES UP THE WHOLE HOUSE
VERENA TALKED OF THE MARRIAGE-TIE AS SHE WOULD HAVE TALKED OF THE LAST NOVEL--AS IF SHE HAD HEARD IT AS FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED
SHE IS VERY GRACEFUL HAS A FINE COMMAND OF LANGUAGE
BUT HE DID NOT TAKE THAT UP BECAUSE HE MUST ABSOLUTELY LEAVE BOSTON ON THE MORROW AND BESIDES MISS CHANCELLOR APPEARED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO IT
BASIL RANSOM WONDERED WHETHER IT WERE EFFRONTERY OR INNOCENCE THAT ENABLED MISS TARRANT TO MEET WITH SUCH COMPLACENCY THE ALOOFNESS OF THE ELDER LADY
I SHALL SEND YOU A CARD
SELAH WAS QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC AT ONE TIME ABOUT MRS FOAT AND IT WAS HIS WIFE'S BELIEF THAT HE HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HER THAT WAS SELAH'S EXPRESSION IN REFERRING TO SUCH EPISODES AT CAYUGA
HER ONLY ESPOUSALS WOULD BE AT THE ALTAR OF A GREAT CAUSE
BUT THE NEWEST THING WAS WHAT CAME NEAREST EXCITING IN HIS MIND THE SENTIMENT OF RESPECT
WHAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HER WAS THAT HE HAD RALLIED AS THE FRENCH SAY HAD ACCEPTED THE ACCOMPLISHED FACT HAD ADMITTED THAT NORTH AND SOUTH WERE A SINGLE INDIVISIBLE POLITICAL ORGANISM
IF YOU THOUGHT I LIVED IN NEW YORK WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T YOU COME AND SEE ME THE LADY INQUIRED
AND SHE REFLECTED WITH SOME COMPLACENCY THAT HER DAUGHTER DID KNOW--SHE KNEW HOW TO DO EVERYTHING OF THAT SORT
MISS BIRDSEYE DREW NEAR AT THIS MOMENT
WHY IN THE WORLD CAN'T THEY LET HER ALONE AND PREPARED TO THROW A FOLD OF HER MANTLE AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE OVER HER YOUNG FRIEND
TRY TO REFORM HIM
RANSOM COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT OF THE GENERAL QUESTION AND BORED WITH BEING REMINDED EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF HER RIGHTS THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN--A DETAIL THAT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF FORGETTING HAVING AS MANY RIGHTS AS SHE HAD TIME FOR
HE ASKED HIMSELF
SPARE DRY HARD WITHOUT A CURVE AN INFLEXION OR A GRACE SHE SEEMED TO ASK NO ODDS IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE AND TO BE PREPARED TO GIVE NONE
FROM YOUR SEEING THINGS OF YOURSELF SINCERELY AND WITH CONVICTION IN THE LIGHT IN WHICH I SEE THEM
OLIVE'S DETAINING HAND IMMEDIATELY RELAXED ITSELF
OLIVE CHANCELLOR SEEMED TO HERSELF TO HAVE PRIVILEGES ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING AFFILIATED TO THE EXCLUSIVE SET AND HAVING INVITATIONS TO THE SMALLER PARTIES WHICH WERE THE REAL TEST
I SEE IT WAS MY JEALOUSY THAT SPOKE--MY RESTLESS HUNGRY JEALOUSY
I HAVE SEEN HER BUT TWICE IN MY LIFE IF YOU HAD SEEN HER MORE I SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID
AN OPEN CELLARWAY YAWNED BENEATH THE FEET OF THOSE WHO MIGHT PAUSE TO GAZE TOO FONDLY ON THE SAVOURY WARES DISPLAYED IN THE WINDOW
MRS TARRANT HAD AN IDEA THAT SHE MRS TARRANT LIKED TO STUDY PEOPLE AND THAT SHE WAS NOW ENGAGED IN AN ANALYSIS OF MISS CHANCELLOR
GREAT EFFORTS WERE NOTHING NEW TO HER--IT WAS A GREAT EFFORT TO LIVE AT ALL--BUT THIS ONE APPEARED TO HER EXCEPTIONALLY CRUEL
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE HAD HAD AN INSPIRATION
WELL WE HAVE ENJOYED SEEING YOU IN OUR HOME
VERENA COULD SCARCELY SAY TO HER SHE GUESSED MISS CHANCELLOR DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF THAT PERSONAGE TRUE AS IT WAS THAT THE GIRL HAD DISCERNED THIS ANGULAR FACT WHICH SHE ATTRIBUTED TO OLIVE'S EXTRAORDINARY COMPREHENSIVENESS OF VIEW
THEN WITH HER QUAVERING VOICE TOUCHED WITH A VIBRATION OF ANGUISH SHE SAID
OLIVE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU SHE HOPED YOU WILL STAY TO DINNER
HE STAYED HALF AN HOUR LONGER AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE
AND WHAT KEPT IT ABOVE ALL FROM SUBSIDING WAS HER SENSE THAT SHE FOUND HERE WHAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR SO LONG--A FRIEND OF HER OWN SEX WITH WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE A UNION OF SOUL
SHE ALIGHTED WITHOUT HIS HELP AND BEHIND HER HE ASCENDED THE HIGH STEPS OF MISS BIRDSEYE'S RESIDENCE
THE DENOUEMENT WOULD OF COURSE BE IN KEEPING AND WOULD CONSIST SIMPLY OF THE SPIRITUAL DEATH OF MRS LUNA WHO WOULD END BY UNDERSTANDING NO COMMON SPEECH OF OLIVE'S AT ALL AND WOULD SINK INTO MERE WORLDLY PLUMPNESS INTO THE LAST COMPLACENCY THE SUPREME IMBECILITY OF PETTY GENTEEL CONSERVATISM
HE HAD HAD NONE BUT SMALL JOBS AND HE HAD MADE A MESS OF MORE THAN ONE OF THEM
THE RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THAT PICTURESQUE GROUPING HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING INTERNECINE
WAS IT NOT SICKENING TO HEAR HER TALK OF THIS DREARY PROCESS OF PREPARATION?--AS IF ANY ONE CARED ABOUT THAT AND WOULD KNOW WHETHER VERENA WERE PREPARED OR NOT
THAT'S WHAT I SAID TO MYSELF AS I SAT THERE IN YOUR ELEGANT HOME HE COULD NOT SEE IN THE DIMNESS OF THE CARRIAGE THAT SHE HAD FLUSHED QUICKLY AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE DISLIKED TO BE REMINDED OF CERTAIN THINGS WHICH FOR HER WERE MITIGATIONS OF THE HARD FEMININE LOT
HER AMBITION FOR HER DAUGHTER TOOK ANOTHER FORM THAN DESIRING THAT SHE TOO SHOULD MINISTER TO A BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY
VERENA HAD GIVEN GREAT ATTENTION TO OLIVE'S BRILLIANT SISTER
BUT WE MUST BE HARD IF WE WISH TO TRIUMPH
HE DIDN'T CARE HOW MUCH HE TOLD HER THAT THE OLD IDEAS IN THE SOUTH WERE PLAYED OUT
IT DIDN'T ADD IN THE LEAST TO THE ATTRACTION
IT SEEMS AS IF IT WERE A REAL GIFT DOES SHE SPEAK OFTEN--IS THERE ANY CHANCE OF MY HEARING HER NOW SHE RAISES HER VOICE A GOOD DEAL IN THE PLACES ROUND--LIKE FRAMINGHAM AND BILLERICA
OLIVE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO PARTICULARS ABOUT VERENA
DISINTERESTEDNESS TOO WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH RECEIPTS
SHE HAD TRUDGED ABOUT THE STREETS OF BOSTON FOR FIFTY YEARS AND AT NO PERIOD HAD SHE RECEIVED THAT AMOUNT OF ATTENTION FROM DARK-EYED YOUNG MEN
AND WHILE SHE STOOD THERE IN DIM CIRCUMSPECTION SHE CAME BACK TO HIM AS A FRIEND OF YESTERDAY
AND HER SIMPLE AND COMPREHENSIVE CONTENTION WAS THAT THE PECULIAR WRETCHEDNESS WHICH HAD BEEN THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE FEMININE LOT WAS A MONSTROUS ARTIFICIAL IMPOSITION CRYING ALOUD FOR REDRESS
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ATTRACTING A CROWD
SHE KNEW THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE RICH AND OTHERS POOR AND THAT HER FATHER'S HOUSE HAD NEVER BEEN VISITED BY SUCH ABUNDANCE AS MIGHT MAKE ONE ASK ONE'S SELF WHETHER IT WERE RIGHT IN A WORLD SO FULL OF THE DISINHERITED TO ROLL IN LUXURY
HE HADN'T SEEN HER THERE AND HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HAVING ENCOUNTERED ANY MENTION AT THE TIME LAST JUNE WAS IT OF HER EXPLOITS AT THE FEMALE CONVENTION
IF SHE WAS THEATRICAL SHE WAS NATURALLY THEATRICAL
RANSOM REPAIRED HIS NEGLECT IN A MANNER WHICH ELICITED THE MOST COPIOUS RESPONSE FROM HIS HOSTESS
BUT SHE NEVER SAW HER ALONE NEVER SAW HER AT ALL BUT IN GLIMPSES
AND ON THE OTHER HAND HOW WEAK VERENA WOULD BE ON THE STATISTICAL AND LOGICAL SIDE IF SHE HERSELF SHOULD NOT BRING UP THE REAR
THEY HAD A LITTLE DISCUSSION HOWEVER WHEN SHE INTIMATED THAT SHE PITIED HIM FOR HIS DISCOMFITURE OLIVE'S CONTENTION BEING THAT SELFISH CONCEITED PAMPERED AND INSINCERE HE MIGHT PROPERLY BE LEFT NOW TO DIGEST HIS AFFRONT
WHAT HER SISTER IMPARTED TO HIM ABOUT HER MANIA FOR REFORM HAD LEFT IN HIS MOUTH A KIND OF UNPLEASANT AFTERTASTE
IN REPORT WAS APPARENTLY TARRANT'S VERSION OF EN RAPPORT
NOT FROM ECONOMY FOR SHE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE NOT TO BE OBLIGED TO CONSULT IT TO THAT DEGREE AND NOT FROM ANY LOVE OF WANDERING ABOUT BOSTON AT NIGHT A KIND OF EXPOSURE SHE GREATLY DISLIKED BUT BY REASON OF A THEORY SHE DEVOTEDLY NURSED A THEORY WHICH BADE HER PUT OFF INVIDIOUS DIFFERENCES AND MINGLE IN THE COMMON LIFE
MISS CHANCELLOR'S ASPIRATIONS OF LATE HAD BEEN IMMENSELY QUICKENED
THEY WERE FAR FROM COMMON BUT THEIR EXISTENCE WAS AS INCONTESTABLE AS IT WAS BENEFICENT
SHE WISHED HER TO HOLD A COMMISSION FROM THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOUR SISTER'S A ROARING RADICAL A RADICAL
OH THANK YOU SAID BASIL RANSOM
IF I COULD TAKE HER TO NEW YORK I WOULD TAKE HER FARTHER SHE REMARKED HOPING SHE WAS ENIGMATICAL
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LADIES SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ADDING WHEN HIS PROMPTNESS CHECKED HER
IF I COULD ONLY HEAR YOU FIRST--JUST TO GIVE ME AN ATMOSPHERE I'VE GOT NO ATMOSPHERE
OF COURSE HE LIKED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON VERENA
YOU WANT ONE OF THEM BLUE CARS THE GOOD LADY RETURNED TO A SENSE OF THE SITUATION AND RANSOM HELPED HER OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE AID AS BEFORE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROPULSION FROM THE CONDUCTOR
WHEN HE WAS INDISCREET HE WANTED TO KNOW IT
BUT I DO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT MRS FARRINDER INQUIRED LOOKING AT HER INTERLOCUTRESS UP AND DOWN WITH THE EYE OF BUSINESS IN WHICH THERE WAS A CERTAIN CHILL
WELL I DON'T KNOW--I GUESS WE ARE ALL SOLID HERE THIS GENTLEMAN REPLIED LOOKING ROUND HIM WITH A SLOW DELIBERATE SMILE WHICH MADE HIS MOUTH ENORMOUS DEVELOPED TWO WRINKLES AS LONG AS THE WINGS OF A BAT ON EITHER SIDE OF IT AND SHOWED A SET OF BIG EVEN CARNIVOROUS TEETH
SHE IS TRYING TO MAKE ME SLEEP
WHEN I TELL HER THAT SHE SAYS SHE HASN'T GOT ANY TO LOOK AFTER
TO PAT US ON THE BACK AND RECOMMEND A FEW MODERATE CONCESSIONS
HAD BEEN ON A VISIT TO FRIENDS IN THE WEST AND WOULD THEREFORE NATURALLY BE A STRANGER TO MOST OF THE BOSTON CIRCLE
HIS ERRAND DEMANDED MORE TIME THAN BEFORE AND FOR THREE DAYS HE GAVE IT HIS CONSTANT ATTENTION
SUCH IS THE PENALTY OF BEING OF A FASTIDIOUS EXCLUSIVE UNCOMPROMISING NATURE
YES VERY MUCH--AS A PIANIST VERENA WENT INTO TOWN WITH HER IN THE HORSE-CAR--SHE WAS STAYING IN CHARLES STREET FOR A FEW DAYS--AND THAT EVENING SHE STARTLED OLIVE BY BREAKING OUT INTO A REFLEXION VERY SIMILAR TO THE WHIMSICAL FALTERINGS OF WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS WHILE THEY SAT IN MR BURRAGE'S PRETTY ROOMS BUT AGAINST WHICH SHE HAD NOW VIOLENTLY REACTED
DESIRED IN ORDER TO FEEL THAT TO TAKE HER OUT OF SUCH A MILIEU AS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO DRAW HER ALTOGETHER TO HERSELF
AT THE END OF AN HOUR HE FELT I WILL NOT SAY ALMOST MARRIAGEABLE BUT ALMOST MARRIED
VERENA HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF MEETING MARTYRS FROM HER CHILDHOOD UP BUT SHE HAD SEEN NONE WITH SO MANY REMINISCENCES AS MISS BIRDSEYE OR WHO HAD BEEN SO NEARLY SCORCHED BY PENAL FIRES
MISS BIRDSEYE LIVED AT THE SOUTH END
THE LEVITY WITH WHICH SHE HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE DERISION OF THE LAWFUL GUARDIANS OF HER FORTUNE OPENED HIS EYES TO SOME OF THE DANGERS OF COUSINSHIP
MISS BIRDSEYE WENT ABOUT WITH HER EIGHTY YEARS OF INNOCENCE HER UNDISCRIMINATING SPECTACLES ASKING HER FRIENDS IF IT WASN'T PERFECTLY SPLENDID
BUT AFTER A LITTLE SHE WENT ON
THEY'VE GOT A CAPACITY FOR MAKING PEOPLE WASTE TIME
IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS THAT SHE ASKED HERSELF WHY HE HAD NOT TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD TILL THE LAST SO QUICKLY
AND IT IS CURIOUS THAT THOSE QUALITIES WHICH HE HAD IN COMMON WITH VERENA AND WHICH IN HER SEEMED TO OLIVE ROMANTIC AND TOUCHING--HER HAVING SPRUNG FROM THE PEOPLE HAD AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH POVERTY A HAND-TO-MOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND AN EXPERIENCE OF THE SEAMY SIDE OF LIFE--AVAILED IN NO DEGREE TO CONCILIATE MISS CHANCELLOR
BUT HERE AT LEAST WAS THE COMFORT THAT SHE COULD COVER HERSELF WITH THE GENERAL ABSOLUTION EXTENDED TO THE BOSTON TEMPERAMENT AND LEAVE HER ALONE
HE KNEW THAT SHE HAD APPEARED IN TWO OR THREE PARLOURS SINCE THAT EVENING AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S AND HE HAD HEARD OF THE DELIGHTFUL OCCASION AT MISS CHANCELLOR'S OWN HOUSE WHERE SO MANY OF THE FIRST FAMILIES HAD BEEN INVITED TO MEET HER
OH YES YOU MUST USE IT
YOU MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR POSITION--YOU MUST WAKE UP THE BACK BAY I'M SICK OF THE BACK BAY SAID OLIVE FIERCELY
IT MUST BE ADDED THAT IN SPITE OF HER MELODRAMATIC APPEARANCE THERE WAS NO SYMPTOM THAT HER PERFORMANCE WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD BE OF A MELODRAMATIC CHARACTER
I DON'T REQUIRE SYMPATHY SHE SAID WITH A TRANQUIL SMILE TO OLIVE CHANCELLOR
SO LONG AS THEY WERE NOT SOME ONE ELSE IT SEEMED TO BE NO USE THAT THEY WERE THEMSELVES
WELL DID SHE CONVINCE YOU RANSOM INQUIRED
SHE HAD COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE EFFORT OF MAKING THIS DECLARATION AND SHE STOOD THERE SMILING AT HER LISTENERS
I CAN'T FIGURE IT UP TILL ALL THE STATES HAVE BEEN HEARD FROM HE SAID SMILING
SHE SIDLED ABOUT HER VISITORS AND AT LAST WENT ROUND TO OPEN FOR THEM A DOOR OF FURTHER ADMISSION WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LOCKED INSIDE
COME OUT WITH ME OLIVE SPOKE ALMOST WITH FIERCENESS
SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD HE WAS DOING THERE ALONE--WHETHER HER SISTER HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED
THAT THIS EXTREME CANDOUR OF ALLUSION TO HER NEIGHBOUR WAS PROBABLY NOT HABITUAL TO HER AS A MEMBER OF A SOCIETY IN WHICH THE CASUAL EXPRESSION OF STRONG OPINION GENERALLY PRODUCED WAVES OF SILENCE
THERE WAS NOTHING INCONCEIVABLE IN HER BEING ENGAGED AT THAT HOUR IT WAS GETTING TO BE ONE O'CLOCK IN ONE OF THOSE EXPEDITIONS--NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE IN THE CHANCE THAT HE MIGHT FIND HER IN CAMBRIDGE
VERENA'S FACE BRIGHTENED AND GREW TRIUMPHANT AS SHE SPOKE BUT SHE BROUGHT TEARS INTO THE EYES OF MOST OF THE OTHERS
BUT OLIVE CHANCELLOR WAS UNMARRIED BY EVERY IMPLICATION OF HER BEING
BUT THEIR ERRORS WERE AS NOTHING TO THEIR SUFFERINGS
ONE OF THESE FITS HAD SUDDENLY SEIZED HER NOW WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS CAUSE THOUGH INDEED MRS LUNA HAD MADE IT WORSE BY BECOMING INSTANTLY SO PERSONAL
IT PRESENTED ITSELF TO OLIVE THAT AFTER THIS ENTERTAINMENT IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF COURTESY TO CALL UPON HER
THE PAIR HAD SO OFTEN BEEN IN THE POSITION OF THE TWO AUGURS BEHIND THE ALTAR AND YET HE HAD NEVER GIVEN HER A GLANCE THAT THE WHOLE CIRCLE MIGHTN'T HAVE OBSERVED
HE HAD SEEN IN HIS YOUNGER YEARS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FAILURES THAT HISTORY COMMEMORATES AN IMMENSE NATIONAL FIASCO AND IT HAD IMPLANTED IN HIS MIND A DEEP AVERSION TO THE INEFFECTUAL
HER SUCCESS AT THE CONVENTION WAS VERY GREAT RANSOM INQUIRED PUTTING DISCRETION INTO HIS VOICE
VERENA WAS BORN NOT ONLY TO LEAD THEIR COMMON SEX OUT OF BONDAGE BUT TO REMODEL A VISITING-LIST WHICH BULGED AND CONTRACTED IN THE WRONG PLACES LIKE A COUNTRY-MADE GARMENT
HE THREW IT DOWN AT THE APPROACH OF MRS LUNA LAUGHED SHOOK HANDS WITH HER AND SAID IN ANSWER TO HER LAST REMARK YOU IMPLY THAT YOU DO TELL FIBS
THERE WASN'T MUCH YOU COULD KEEP AWAY FROM THEM
I GUESS YOU CHANGE HERE FOR YOUR PLACE
SHE SEEMED TO THINK I WOULDN'T WANT TO MISS THAT WHEREAS I INFER YOU COULD CONSOLE YOURSELF FOR THE LOSS OF THE ORATION RANSOM SUGGESTED
I DON'T SPEAK TO MEN FOR I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO LIKE WHAT I SAY
IT REMINDED HER HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND THAT HE TOO HAD BEEN MUCH BEREAVED AND MOREOVER THAT HE HAD FOUGHT AND OFFERED HIS OWN LIFE EVEN IF IT HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN
WHY HAD SHE MADE ADVANCES IF SHE WANTED TO PINCH HIM THIS WAY
SHE HAD EXPLAINED IT AS WE EXPLAIN ALL EXCEPTIONAL THINGS BY MAKING THE PART AS THE FRENCH SAY OF THE MIRACULOUS
THE CORNER WAS QUIET AND THE DAY FAVOURABLE TO PATIENCE--A DAY OF RELAXED RIGOUR AND INTENSE BRILLIANCY
SHE HAD CONFIDENCE ENOUGH TO WISH HIM TO SEE THAT SHE TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN HIM
AND SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WAS WOMEN IN THE END WHO HAD PAID FOR EVERYTHING
YOU WOULD STAY IF YOU LIKED IT WOULDN'T YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO
SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THAT
WHEN THE GREAT REFORMS SHOULD BE CONSUMMATED WHEN THE DAY OF JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE DAWNED WOULD NOT LIFE PERHAPS BE RATHER POOR AND PALE
A REPORT OF THE AFFAIR PRESUMABLY FROM THE HAND OF THE YOUNG MATTHIAS WHO NATURALLY HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT APPEARED WITH EXTRAORDINARY PROMPTNESS IN AN EVENING-PAPER THAT WAS VERY WELL SO FAR AS IT WENT BUT HE WANTED SOMETHING ON ANOTHER SCALE SOMETHING SO BIG THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO GO ROUND IF THEY WANTED TO GET PAST
HE COULD SCARCELY HAVE TOLD YOU HOW HE WOULD GO ABOUT IT
BUT DON'T LISTEN TO THEM TO WHOM DO YOU MEAN OLIVE
AND MRS LUNA FROM VERENA'S DESCRIPTION OF HER SUMMED UP THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS ECCENTRIC CLASS
FOR WAS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S LITTLE FRIEND MIGHT BE JUST THEN ADDRESSING HER FELLOW-CITIZENS
WHATEVER IT WAS HE HELD YOU HAVE ONLY TO LOOK FOR HER
HER INSISTENCE THEREFORE PROVED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE CARED MORE FOR HER FRIEND'S OPINION OF HENRY BURRAGE THAN FOR HER OWN--A REMINDER CERTAINLY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OLIVE HAD INCURRED IN UNDERTAKING TO FORM THIS GENEROUS YOUNG MIND AND OF THE EXALTED PLACE THAT SHE NOW OCCUPIED IN IT
CERTAINLY SHE SHOULD COME BEFORE THE PUBLIC AND THE WORLD WOULD ACCLAIM HER AND HANG UPON HER WORDS
I THINK IT MIGHT INTEREST YOU SHE REMARKED PRESENTLY
SELAH TARRANT WENT ON CONVERSING OSTENTATIOUSLY WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS SLOWLY TWIRLING HIS LONG THUMBS AND LOOKING UP AT THE CORNICE AGAIN AS IF THERE COULD BE NOTHING IN THE BRILLIANT MANNER IN WHICH HIS DAUGHTER HAD ACQUITTED HERSELF TO SURPRISE HIM WHO HAD HEARD HER WHEN SHE WAS STILL MORE REMARKABLE AND WHO MOREOVER REMEMBERED THAT THE AFFAIR WAS SO IMPERSONAL
BUT THE REPORT NEVER APPEARED
HER HAIR VERY SCANTY WAS DRAWN OFF HER FOREHEAD A LA CHINOISE
CERTAINLY AS SHE KNEW HIM BETTER SHE WOULD DISAPPROVE OF HIM THOUGH OF COURSE HE WOULD NEVER MENTION THE ACTRESS NOR EVEN IF NECESSARY THE BEER
SHE WAS PROUD OF VERENA'S BRIGHTNESS AND OF HER SPECIAL TALENT
SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE HAD LOST HIM AS WHAT SHE HAD HOPED BUT THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN DESOLATION TO TRY AND KEEP HIM AS A FRIEND
VERENA WAS SO SIMPLE SHE COULDN'T SEE HERSELF
SELAH LOOKED AT THE CHEQUE AT MISS CHANCELLOR AT THE CHEQUE AGAIN AT THE CEILING AT THE FLOOR AT THE CLOCK AND ONCE MORE AT HIS HOSTESS
HIS FAITH AGAIN WAS THE FAITH OF SELAH TARRANT--THAT BEING IN THE NEWSPAPERS IS A CONDITION OF BLISS AND THAT IT WOULD BE FASTIDIOUS TO QUESTION THE TERMS OF THE PRIVILEGE
SHE HAD JUST COME DOWN TO SEE DOCTOR PRANCE--TO SEE WHETHER SHE WOULDN'T LIKE TO COME UP
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER IN NEW YORK IN CONVERSATION WITH MRS LUNA OF WHOM HE WAS DESTINED TO SEE A GOOD DEAL HE ALLUDED BY CHANCE TO THIS REPAST TO THE WAY HER SISTER HAD PLACED HIM AT TABLE AND TO THE REMARK WITH WHICH SHE HAD POINTED OUT THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS SEAT
MR PARDON EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION THAT MISS CHANCELLOR AGREED WITH HIM IN THIS AND IT REQUIRED A GREAT EFFORT OF MIND ON OLIVE'S PART SO SMALL WAS HER DESIRE TO ACT IN CONCERT WITH MR PARDON TO ADMIT TO HERSELF THAT SHE DID
AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED VERENA AT SUCH MOMENTS QUITE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
ONLY THEY DIDN'T WRITE MUCH BUT WHAT LADIES WOULD WANT TO READ
BUT THEY WANDERED MAINLY IN THE DIRECTION OF MRS FARRINDER--THEY LINGERED UPON THE SERENE SOLIDITY OF THE GREAT ORATRESS
DIDN'T I TELL YOU OF THE SENSATION SHE PRODUCED THERE AND OF WHAT I HEARD FROM BOSTON ABOUT IT
THERE WERE TWO OR THREE PALE SHOP-MAIDENS WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD SOUGHT
SHE COULD SPEND HOURS AND DAYS WITH HER MOTHER WHENEVER MRS TARRANT REQUIRED HER ATTENTION
ASK MOTHER IF IT AIN'T SHE HAD EXPRESSED HERSELF FROM THE FIRST WORD SHE UTTERED WITH A PROMPTNESS AND ASSURANCE WHICH GAVE ALMOST THE IMPRESSION OF A LESSON REHEARSED IN ADVANCE
SHE GLANCED IN AN UNPREJUDICED WAY AT THE BIG PARTI-COLOURED HUMAN VAN WHICH NOW JINGLED TOWARD THEM FROM OUT OF THE CAMBRIDGE ROAD
IT SEEMED AS IF HE COULDN'T HOLD OUT
BUT AFTER ALL SHE COULD GIVE VERY LITTLE ACCOUNT OF HERSELF
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE EMPRESS OF FRANCE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAST WAR IN THAT COUNTRY
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY OPERATE AS A PROOF THAT THE ARIDITY OF HER LIFE WAS GREAT AND IF IT SHOULD HAVE THAT EFFECT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO GAINSAY IT
WHERE DO YOU LIVE VERENA ANSWERED IN THE TONE OF A GIRL FOR WHOM AN INVITATION SHE HADN'T SO MANY WAS ALWAYS AN INVITATION
HER HEAD FELL A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE EXHIBITING THE PLUMPNESS OF HER CHIN AND NECK AND HER DROPPED EYES IT GAVE HER A LITTLE MODEST AIR RESTED QUIETLY ON HER WORK
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN HER
I COULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU FOR ANOTHER HOUR
VERENA WAS IMMENSELY WROUGHT UPON
SHE HAD AN EXAMPLE OF THE REST IN THE PERSONS OF TWO YOUNG HARVARD LAW-STUDENTS WHO PRESENTED THEMSELVES AFTER TEA ON THIS SAME OCCASION
AND FROM BENEATH HER JACKET DEPENDED A SHORT STUFF DRESS
HER FATHER DIED LEAVING AFTER ALL VERY LITTLE MONEY
IF HE SHOULD COME AND SPEAK TO HER--AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO WORK ROUND THAT WAY--SHE SHOULD JUST SAY TO HIM YES SIR OR NO SIR VERY COLDLY
THE STRANGE DREAD ASSOCIATING ITSELF WITH THAT WAS SOMETHING WHICH SHE DEVOUTLY TRUSTED SHE HAD FELT ONCE FOR ALL
SHE SUFFERED LESS THAN SHE HAD HOPED--SHE WAS SO TAKEN UP WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF VERENA'S INTERIOR
HE EVEN SOMETIMES BROUGHT CONTRIBUTIONS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN FANCIED THAT IS BY A PERSON LESS SURE OF THE CONTRARY THAN OLIVE WHO HAD REASON TO KNOW THAT A GIFTED BEING IS SENT INTO THE WORLD FOR A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND THAT MAKING THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY FOR CONCEITED YOUNG MEN IS THE LAST DUTY YOU ARE BOUND TO THINK OF IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A TALENT FOR EMBODYING A CAUSE
IT WAS A SATISFACTION TO HER THAT VERENA EVIDENTLY RESPONDED FREELY
HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IF HE SHOULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE A HALL SOME NIGHT SHE WOULD TELL HIM WHERE THE BILL MIGHT BE SENT
POVERTY AND IGNORANCE AND CRIME
IF THEY COULD SHOW HIM A BETTER WAY HE WAS WILLING TO ADOPT IT
SHE TALKED CONTINUALLY IN A VOICE OF WHICH THE SPRING SEEMED BROKEN LIKE THAT OF AN OVER-WORKED BELL-WIRE
HE KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT MISS CHANCELLOR
THERE ARE MOVEMENTS IN OTHER CITIES
XIII MRS TARRANT WAS DELIGHTED AS MAY BE IMAGINED WITH HER DAUGHTER'S ACCOUNT OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S INTERIOR AND THE RECEPTION THE GIRL HAD FOUND THERE
SUCCESS WAS NOT SUCCESS SO LONG AS HIS DAUGHTER'S PHYSIQUE THE RUMOUR OF HER ENGAGEMENT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE JOTTINGS WITH THE CERTAINTY OF BEING EXTENSIVELY COPIED
WHY OLIVE HOW YOU CHANGE MY DEAR CHILD YOU ARE SO YOUNG--SO STRANGELY YOUNG
HER FATHER SEEMED TO VERENA TO MOVE MORE CONSECUTIVELY ON THE HIGH PLANE
WELL I GUESS THAT WILL BE YOUR FATE
AND WHEN VERENA AFTERWARDS ATTEMPTED TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS CONVERSATION SHE CHECKED HER SAID SHE WOULD RATHER KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT--ALL WITH A VERY SOLEMN MILDNESS
INDIVIDUAL AND ORIGINAL AS MISS CHANCELLOR WAS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE SHE WAS YET A TYPICAL BOSTONIAN AND AS A TYPICAL BOSTONIAN SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO BELONG IN SOME DEGREE TO A SET IT HAD BEEN SAID OF HER THAT SHE WAS IN IT BUT NOT OF IT
AND DO THEY MEAN TO GO ON LIVING TOGETHER FOR EVER I SUPPOSE SO--UNLESS SOME ONE SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO MARRY VERENA VERENA--IS THAT HER NAME RANSOM ASKED
THE ARTISTIC SENSE IN BASIL RANSOM HAD NOT BEEN HIGHLY CULTIVATED
IN VERENA'S FACE HOWEVER IT LASTED BUT AN INSTANT--AN INSTANT AFTER SHE HAD GLANCED AT OLIVE CHANCELLOR WHO WITH HER EYES FIXED INTENTLY ON THE GROUND A LOOK SHE WAS TO LEARN TO KNOW SO WELL HAD A STRANGE EXPRESSION
IT WAS TRUE THAT AT PRESENT MR BURRAGE CAME A GREAT DEAL TO THE LITTLE HOUSE AT CAMBRIDGE
THE VISION OF THAT PUBLICITY HAUNTED HIS DREAMS AND HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SACRIFICED TO IT THE INNERMOST SANCTITIES OF HOME
HE DID NOT KNOW THEN AND HE NEVER KNEW THAT SHE MORTALLY DISLIKED IT AND THAT IN A CAREER IN WHICH SHE WAS CONSTANTLY EXPOSING HERSELF TO OFFENCE AND LACERATION HER MOST POIGNANT SUFFERING CAME FROM THE INJURY OF HER TASTE
FOR THE PROSPECT OF SUFFERING WAS ALWAYS SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING SO MUCH CASH IN HER POCKET
GOOD-NIGHT DOCTOR HE REPLIED
YES IF WE WILL GIVE UP EVERYTHING
THEN SHE MURMURED
BASIL THOUGHT SHE HAD AN ENGAGING EXTERIOR
I SUPPOSE WE WANT TO BE QUIET MISS BIRDSEYE REMARKED
SHE DELIGHTED IN THE DILAPIDATED GENTRY
HE HAD QUITTED HER THE OTHER YEAR WITHOUT TELLING HER THAT SHE WAS A VIXEN AND THAT RETICENCE WAS CHIVALROUS ENOUGH
SUCH REVELATIONS OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SATISFACTORY
IT WAS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT HE HAD SEEN NO REFERENCE TO VERENA'S PERFORMANCES IN THE PRECEDING JUNE
IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT IN THIS REASONING OF BASIL RANSOM'S THE IMPRESSION WAS FREELY RECOGNISED AND RECOGNISED AS A PHENOMENON STILL PRESENT
I AM AFRAID WE ARE SADLY SUNK CERTAINLY I SHOULD LIKE TO RAISE MY VOICE IN THE BIGGEST CITY THE GIRL REPLIED
OLIVE DIDN'T APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE MATTHIAS PARDON DREW THAT PICTURE AND TRIED TO HOLD HER HAND THIS IMAGE WAS UNFORTUNATE SHE HAD GIVEN ONE LONG FIXED WISTFUL LOOK THROUGH THE DOOR HE OPENED AT THE BRIGHT TUMULT OF THE WORLD AND THEN HAD TURNED AWAY SOLELY FOR HER FRIEND'S SAKE TO AN AUSTERER PROBATION AND A PURER EFFORT
FOR THIS INGENUOUS SON OF HIS AGE ALL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PERSON AND THE ARTIST HAD CEASED TO EXIST
SHE WORE A LOOSE BLACK JACKET WITH DEEP POCKETS WHICH WERE STUFFED WITH PAPERS MEMORANDA OF A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE
IT WAS APPARENT INDEED THAT SHE WAS EXCITED BY THE COMPANY IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF
THEN THROWING BACK HER HEAD WITH AN AIR OF DECISION SHE CROSSED OVER TO HER
MR BURRAGE WAS RATHER A HANDSOME YOUTH WITH A LAUGHING CLEVER FACE A CERTAIN SUMPTUOSITY OF APPAREL AN AIR OF BELONGING TO THE FAST SET"--A PRECOCIOUS GOOD-NATURED MAN OF THE WORLD CURIOUS OF NEW SENSATIONS AND CONTAINING PERHAPS THE MAKING OF A DILETTANTE
THE ENDS SHE LABOURED FOR WERE TO GIVE THE BALLOT TO EVERY WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY AND TO TAKE THE FLOWING BOWL FROM EVERY MAN
THIS YOUNG LADY THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO GIVE HER A VERY FIRM ANSWER
YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU A POSSIBLE CONVERT RANSOM WENT ON WITHOUT I FEAR PUTTING UP THE LEAST LITTLE PRAYER TO HEAVEN THAT HIS DISHONESTY MIGHT BE FORGIVEN
WELL PERHAPS YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED IN VERENA SAID MRS TARRANT WITH AN AIR OF DOLOROUS RESIGNATION TO ANY EVENT AND SEATING HERSELF WITH HER GATHERED MANTLE ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AS IF SHE AT LEAST WERE READY WHOEVER ELSE MIGHT KEEP ON TALKING
IN THIS SURMISE SHE WAS JUST
LITTLE DOCTOR PRANCE WITH HER HARD GOOD SENSE HAD NOTED THAT SHE WAS ANAEMIC AND HAD INTIMATED THAT SHE WAS A DECEIVER
THE WAVES OF SYMPATHY OF ENTHUSIASM HAD WROUGHT UPON THEM IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH THE WAVES OF TIME FINALLY MODIFY THE SURFACE OF OLD MARBLE BUSTS GRADUALLY WASHING AWAY THEIR SHARPNESS THEIR DETAILS
SO THAT HE BEGAN TO INTERSPACE HIS VISITS CONSIDERABLY AND AT LAST MADE THEM VERY RARE
IF SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE FINE OLD INSTITUTIONS OF THE PAST HE WOULD SUPPLY THEM TO HER IN ABUNDANCE
BUT ANY MAN WHO PRETENDS TO ACCEPT OUR PROGRAMME IN TOTO AS YOU AND I UNDERSTAND IT OF HIS OWN FREE WILL BEFORE HE IS FORCED TO--SUCH A PERSON SIMPLY SCHEMES TO BETRAY US
SHE COULD STUDY UP AS SHE WENT ALONG
I AM A THOUSAND YEARS OLD
IT WAS NOT WHAT SHE SAID
THAT'S WHAT OLIVE CHANCELLOR DOES
SHE WORE A LIGHT-BROWN DRESS OF A SHAPE THAT STRUCK HIM AS FANTASTIC A YELLOW PETTICOAT AND A LARGE CRIMSON SASH FASTENED AT THE SIDE
DO YOU THINK SHE IS VERY DREADFUL DON'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST MY COUSIN BASIL ANSWERED
THERE WAS A GENIUS FOR MISS BIRDSEYE IN EVERY BUSH
THE EXTRUSION AT CHARLESTOWN AT CAMBRIDGE OF A FEW CHIMNEYS AND STEEPLES STRAIGHT SORDID TUBES OF FACTORIES AND ENGINE-SHOPS OR SPARE HEAVENWARD FINGER OF THE NEW ENGLAND MEETING-HOUSE
SHE HAD SUFFERED IN THE SAME WAY BY THE RELAXATION OF MANY EUROPEAN DESPOTISMS FOR IN FORMER YEARS MUCH OF THE ROMANCE OF HER LIFE HAD BEEN IN SMOOTHING THE PILLOW OF EXILE FOR BANISHED CONSPIRATORS
THEREFORE WOULD MISS CHANCELLOR JUST TELL HIM THIS
OH YES I KNOW THERE ARE MEN WHO PRETEND TO CARE FOR IT
SHE THOUGHT IT SO POSSIBLE THAT IN THE WEALTHY CLASS PEOPLE MADE EACH OTHER SUCH EASY PROPOSALS
IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE-MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE QUESTION WHETHER IN HER HEART OF HEARTS FOR THE SAKE OF THIS EXCITEMENT SHE DID NOT SOMETIMES WISH THE BLACKS BACK IN BONDAGE
SHE PRESENTED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN WHICH THEY DID NOT SEEM TO PALPITATE WITH TRUTH
LORD HOW FEW REASONS THERE MUST BE OH I MENTION THAT ONE BECAUSE I CAN TELL IT
I HAVE LIVED THROUGH GENERATIONS--THROUGH CENTURIES
MEN AND WOMEN ARE ALL THE SAME TO ME DOCTOR PRANCE REMARKED
FOR NOT ONLY HAD SHE THE SENSE DOUBTLESS VERY PRESUMPTUOUS THAT MRS FARRINDER WAS THE ONLY PERSON THEREABOUTS OF A STATURE TO JUDGE HER A SUFFICIENT CAUSE OF ANTAGONISM IN ITSELF FOR IF WE LIKE TO BE PRAISED BY OUR BETTERS WE PREFER THAT CENSURE SHOULD COME FROM THE OTHER SORT BUT THE KIND OF OPINION SHE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY BETRAYED AFTER IMPLYING SUCH ESTEEM IN THE EARLIER PHASE OF THEIR INTERCOURSE MADE OLIVE'S CHEEKS OCCASIONALLY FLUSH
IT WAS THIS GLANCE THAT WAS THE BEGINNING
I SHOULD UPSET YOU ALTOGETHER AND THEN SHE CONTINUED TENDERLY FOR SO PREPONDERANTLY INTELLECTUAL A NATURE
IN REALITY OLIVE WAS DISTINGUISHED AND DISCRIMINATING AND ADELINE WAS THE DUPE OF CONFUSIONS IN WHICH THE WORSE WAS APT TO BE MISTAKEN FOR THE BETTER
THE QUESTION WAS NOT A CRITICISM FOR SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED THAT THE GIRL WAS A MASS OF FLUENT CATCH-WORDS AND YET SCARCELY HAVE LIKED HER THE LESS
THE IDEA OF OLIVE'S CHARM WILL PERHAPS MAKE THE READER SMILE
HER QUALITIES HAD NOT BEEN BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
NO MAN THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN CARES A STRAW IN HIS HEART FOR WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH
WHILE MISS BIRDSEYE STOOD THERE ASKING MRS FARRINDER IF SHE WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING OLIVE CHANCELLOR TENDERLY FASTENED A SMALL BATTERED BROOCH WHICH CONFINED HER COLLAR AND WHICH HAD HALF DETACHED ITSELF
IF YOU WERE TO SEE HER AT HOME YOU WOULD THINK SHE WAS ALL THE DAUGHTER
HE LIKED HIS PEDIGREE HE REVERED HIS FOREFATHERS AND HE RATHER PITIED THOSE WHO MIGHT COME AFTER HIM
IF I CAN HELP HER SHE SHALL BE AN IMMENSE POWER FOR GOOD AN IMMENSE POWER FOR QUACKERY MY DEAR MISS OLIVE THIS BROKE FROM BASIL'S LIPS IN SPITE OF A VOW HE HAD JUST TAKEN NOT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT SHOULD AGGRAVATE HIS HOSTESS WHO WAS IN A STATE OF TENSION IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO DETECT
EVEN AMONG REFORMERS SHE DISCRIMINATED
SHE WISHED TO SEE MISS BIRDSEYE ALONE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF ANY ONE ELSE
BUT THIS WAS QUEERER THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD DREAMED OF AND THE QUEEREST PART WAS THAT THE GIRL HERSELF DIDN'T APPEAR TO THINK IT QUEER
THEN HIS WONDER SPENT ITSELF ON THE PAGE OF A BOOK WHICH ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT AT SUCH TIMES HE HAD MECHANICALLY TAKEN UP AND IN WHICH HE SPEEDILY BECAME INTERESTED
THEY HAD EXPIATED IN ADVANCE AN ETERNITY IF NEED BE OF MISCONDUCT
IT IS WHAT THE GREAT SISTERHOOD OF WOMEN MIGHT DO IF THEY SHOULD ALL JOIN HANDS AND LIFT UP THEIR VOICES ABOVE THE BRUTAL UPROAR OF THE WORLD IN WHICH IT IS SO HARD FOR THE PLEA OF MERCY OR OF JUSTICE THE MOAN OF WEAKNESS AND SUFFERING TO BE HEARD
IT WASN'T A PARTY--OLIVE DIDN'T GO TO PARTIES
THIS PHENOMENON OCCURRED WHEN THE VAPOURS OF SOCIAL AMBITION MOUNTED TO HER BRAIN WHEN SHE EXTENDED AN ARM FROM WHICH A CRUMPLED DRESSING-GOWN FLUTTERED BACK TO SEIZE THE PASSING OCCASION
IF SHE WERE FAMOUS WOULDN'T SHE BE IN THE NEW YORK PAPERS
MOSELEY AFTER ALL HAD BEEN VERY TEPID
SACREDLY BRIGHTLY SINGLE SHE WOULD REMAIN
HE FELT BAFFLED AND DISHEARTENED--INDEED QUITE SICK
VIII VERENA TARRANT GOT UP AND WENT TO HER FATHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
VERENA'S DEVELOPMENT WAS THE THING IN THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE TOOK MOST INTEREST
SHE NOTIFIED TARRANT THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP VERENA A LONG TIME AND TARRANT REMARKED THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PLEASANT TO SEE HER SO HAPPILY LOCATED
BUT HE COULDN'T--IN PRIVATE LIFE HE COULDN'T
MR RANSOM THINKS HER WONDERFULLY CHARMING
THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE PLENTY OF MONEY FOR MISS TARRANT
THIS PROCESS WAS INTERRUPTED BY AN ABRUPT ALLOCUTION FROM THE CONDUCTOR
IF MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD JUST LET HER GO A LITTLE HE WOULD LOOK AFTER THE REST
ONE WOULD GO TO THE END OF THE WORLD WITH SO IRRESISTIBLE A LADY RANSOM EXCLAIMED FALLING INTO THE TONE WHICH MRS LUNA ALWAYS FOUND SO UNSATISFACTORY
YOU KNOW YOU LOATHE HER HERE BEFORE RANSOM COULD REPLY MRS LUNA AGAIN OVERTOOK HERSELF
THIS WAS WHAT SHE WANTED
SHE APPEARED TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HER NOW
HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE EXPEDITIONS WERE AS OF SOMETHING SOLEMN AND EDIFYING--OF THE EARNEST INTEREST IN HER WELFARE EXHIBITED BY HER COMPANION THERE WERE FEW OCCASIONS ON WHICH THE YOUNG BOSTONIAN APPEARED TO MORE ADVANTAGE OF THE COMFORT OF OTHER FRIENDS SITTING NEAR WHO WERE SURE TO KNOW WHOM SHE WAS WITH OF SERIOUS DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE ACTS IN REGARD TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE PIECE AND OF THE SPEECH AT THE END WITH WHICH AS THE YOUNG MAN QUITTED HER AT HER DOOR SHE REWARDED HIS CIVILITY--"I MUST THANK YOU FOR A VERY PLEASANT EVENING SHE ALWAYS FELT THAT SHE MADE THAT TOO PRIM
IT IMPLIED AT ANY RATE THAT UNIONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER HAD HER APPROVAL AND DID NOT EXCLUDE THE DANGERS THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM ENCOUNTERS WITH YOUNG MEN IN SEARCH OF SENSATIONS
IT WAS PROLIFIC IN LADIES WHO TROTTED ABOUT EARLY AND LATE WITH BOOKS FROM THE ATHENAEUM NURSED BEHIND THEIR MUFF OR LITTLE NOSEGAYS OF EXQUISITE FLOWERS THAT THEY WERE CARRYING AS PRESENTS TO EACH OTHER
HIS LOFTY CONTEMPLATIVE PERSON WAS FRAMED BY THE DOORWAY
AND IT STRUCK MISS CHANCELLOR MORE ESPECIALLY THAT THIS FRUMPY LITTLE MISSIONARY WAS THE LAST LINK IN A TRADITION AND THAT WHEN SHE SHOULD BE CALLED AWAY THE HEROIC AGE OF NEW ENGLAND LIFE--THE AGE OF PLAIN LIVING AND HIGH THINKING OF PURE IDEALS AND EARNEST EFFORT OF MORAL PASSION AND NOBLE EXPERIMENT--WOULD EFFECTUALLY BE CLOSED
SHE COULD NOT DIVEST HERSELF OF THE FAITH--EVEN NOW THAT MRS LUNA WAS GONE LEAVING NO TRACE AND THE GREY WALLS OF A SEDENTARY WINTER WERE APPARENTLY CLOSING ABOUT THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN--SHE COULD NOT RENOUNCE THE THEORY THAT A RESIDENCE IN CHARLES STREET MUST AT LEAST PRODUCE SOME CONTACT WITH THE BRILLIANT CLASSES
HE WAS A MAN WHO STILL IN A SLANGY AGE COULD PRONOUNCE THAT WORD WITH A PERFECTLY SERIOUS FACE
IF IT WAS A QUESTION OF A FAVOUR FROM MRS FARRINDER YOU JUST HAD TO WAIT FOR IT AS YOU WOULD FOR A RISE IN THE THERMOMETER
THAT VERENA SHOULD DO AS HE ASKED HER WAS A SIGNAL SIGN OF THE ABSENCE OF THAT HOME-CULTURE IT WAS SO THAT MISS CHANCELLOR EXPRESSED THE MISSING QUALITY WHICH SHE NEVER SUPPOSED THE GIRL POSSESSED
HE WISHED SIMPLY TO TELL HER SHE WAS DELIGHTFUL AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MARK THAT DIFFERENCE
THE HALL WAS VERY NARROW
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT EQUALLED THIS PERFECTLY GENTLE AND NATURAL INSENSIBILITY TO FAVOURS--NAMELY THE INVETERACY OF HER HABIT OF NOT ASKING THEM
SHE'LL REFORM YOU IF YOU DON'T LOOK OUT
MRS LUNA WAS DRAWING ON HER GLOVES
I HEARD DOCTOR TARRANT MAKE THE REMARK THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE
THERE WAS A FAINT FRAGRANCE FROM THE BURNING LOGS WHICH MINGLED WITH THE PERFUME OF SCHUBERT AND MENDELSSOHN
IT SUGGESTED AN EXEMPTION FROM OFFICIAL CRITICISM
SHE HAD ALREADY FELT IT IN THE AIR
SHE TURNED AN INSTANT GLANCED AT HIM AND THEN SAID DO YOU THINK SO AN INSTANT LATER SHE ADDED HOW YOU MUST HATE THIS PLACE OH NOT NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN RANSOM REPLIED GOOD-HUMOUREDLY IF A TRIFLE COARSELY
AS IF ANYTHING COULD ADD TO VERENA'S SUCCESS AS IF IT WERE NOT SUPREME SUCCESS SIMPLY TO HAVE BEEN MADE AS SHE WAS MADE
HE WAS NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT HE OCCUPIED SUCH A DISTINCT PLACE IN HER MIND ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE MIGHT DIE TWENTY DEATHS BEFORE HE CAME NEAR HER
THIS WAS STILL FOR HER BENEFIT BUT THE PRONOUN SUFFICED THEM
WITH REGARD TO THIS LATTER POINT HE EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN PRESENT HIS DAUGHTER TO THE COMPANY BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE ON SUCH OCCASIONS THERE WAS A VALUABLE INTERCHANGE OF HOPEFUL THOUGHT A CONTACT OF MIND WITH MIND
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HOW REMARKABLE SHE WENT ON MURMURING THE WORDS AS IF SHE WERE LOSING HERSELF BECOMING INADVERTENT IN ADMIRATION
FROM YOUR FEELING THAT FOR YOUR WORK YOUR FREEDOM IS ESSENTIAL AND THAT THERE IS NO FREEDOM FOR YOU AND ME SAVE IN RELIGIOUSLY NOT DOING WHAT YOU WILL OFTEN BE ASKED TO DO--AND I NEVER MISS CHANCELLOR BROUGHT OUT THESE LAST WORDS WITH A PROUD JERK WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PATHOS
THE PLACE WAS DECORATED AND CUSHIONED IN PERFECTION DELIGHTFULLY PRIVATE AND PERSONAL THE PICTURE OF A WELL-APPOINTED HOME
PRACTICALLY AT LEAST HE ADMITTED THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN
YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE WARS WELL I AM LIKE MRS FARRINDER
SELAH WAS NOT REMARKABLE FOR DELICACY OF PERCEPTION BUT HE KNEW THE WORLD HE LIVED IN WELL ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT MRS FARRINDER WAS LIABLE TO REAR UP AS THEY USED TO SAY DOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HE LIVED BEFORE HE BEGAN TO PEDDLE LEAD-PENCILS
BUT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE WAS CALLED
SHE MAY SPEAK TO-NIGHT MRS FARRINDER THE CELEBRATED YES THE CELEBRATED
MISS BIRDSEYE HAD SOMETHING OF IT BUT MISS BIRDSEYE WANTED PASSION WANTED KEENNESS WAS CAPABLE OF THE WEAKEST CONCESSIONS
THIS LADY HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF MANY OVATIONS
MRS TARRANT'S HAND WAS SOFT ENOUGH FOR THE MOST SUPERNATURAL EFFECT AND SHE CONSOLED HER CONSCIENCE ON SUCH OCCASIONS BY REFLECTING THAT SHE MINISTERED TO A BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY
I CAN SPEAK TO YOU
THE OTHERS RATHER SOLEMNLY SAT LOOKING UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS
HE BELIEVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR HAD CONCEIVED IN THE COURSE OF THOSE FEW HOURS AND IN A MANNER THAT FORMED SO ABSURD A SEQUEL TO HER HAVING GONE OUT OF HER WAY TO MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE SUCH A DISLIKE TO HIM THAT IT WOULD BE ODIOUS TO HER TO SEE HIM AGAIN WITHIN HER DOORS
THIS CONFESSION WAS IN ITSELF A PROOF OF THE FACT FOR NOTHING COULD BE LESS FRUITFUL THAN SUCH A SPECULATION TERMINATING IN SUCH A WAY
THE VOICE THAT SPOKE FROM HER LIPS SEEMED TO WANT TO TAKE THAT FORM
SHE ALWAYS DRESSED IN THE SAME WAY
HE SAYS EVERY HOUR OF MY YOUTH IS PRECIOUS TO ME AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A LOVELY TIME TRAVELLING ROUND THE COUNTRY
WHEN SHE CONVEYED FROM HER MOTHER A SUMMONS TO CAMBRIDGE FOR A PARTICULAR OCCASION OLIVE PERCEIVED THAT THE GREAT EFFORT MUST NOW BE MADE
OLIVE WAS CONSCIOUS ENOUGH OF THE GIRL'S WANT OF CONTINUITY
TASTE AND ART WERE GOOD WHEN THEY ENLARGED THE MIND NOT WHEN THEY NARROWED IT
SYMPHONIES AND FUGUES ONLY STIMULATED THEIR CONVICTIONS EXCITED THEIR REVOLUTIONARY PASSION LED THEIR IMAGINATION FURTHER IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT WAS ALWAYS PRESSING
WHAT WOMEN MAY BE OR MAY NOT BE TO EACH OTHER I WON'T ATTEMPT JUST NOW TO SAY
HE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED EXPRESSING AT THE SAME TIME A HIGH SENSE OF THE HONOUR DONE HIM BY SUCH A REQUEST WHILE HE SMILED TO HIMSELF AT THE IDEA OF HIS EXTEMPORISING A LECTURE
DOCTOR PRANCE WASN'T ACQUAINTED WITH HER BEYOND KNOWING THAT SHE WAS THE MESMERIST'S ONLY CHILD AND HAVING HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT HER HAVING SOME GIFT--SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICH IT WAS
HER ONLY CONSOLATION WAS THAT SHE EXPECTED TO SUFFER INTENSELY
I DON'T MEAN FOR MISS TARRANT I MEAN FOR YOU OLIVE RETURNED WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS LOOKING HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
FOR OLIVE KNEW THAT THE YOUNG INTERVIEWER WOULD NOT EASILY BE SHAKEN OFF AND YET SHE WAS SURE THAT VERENA WOULD NEVER YIELD TO HIM
SHE HASN'T GOT MUCH OF IT HERSELF
BUT HE BLESSED HER IRRITATION FOR HIM IT WAS SO ILLUMINATING
AT THE END OF A FEW WEEKS HE THOUGHT HIMSELF LUCKY IN RETIRING WITHOUT BROKEN SHINS
BASIL RANSOM HAD GOT UP JUST AS MRS LUNA MADE THIS LAST DECLARATION
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY RECRUITS ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WHOSE REFINEMENT IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED
BUT THEY ARE NOT REALLY MEN AND I WOULDN'T BE SURE EVEN OF THEM
ONE OF THEM HAD POSSESSION OF HER AT PRESENT AND SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THE INCONSEQUENCE WHICH HAD PUZZLED HER FRIEND WITH THE SAME QUIET CLEARNESS THE DETACHMENT FROM ERROR OF A WOMAN WHOSE SELF-SCRUTINY HAS BEEN AS SHARP AS HER DEFLEXION
INFLUENCE
I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO STAY A LITTLE SO THAT YOU MAY JUDGE US FOR YOURSELF
IT HAD PROCEEDED RATHER OUT OF THEIR SILENCE
AH THE BOTTOM IS A BETTER PLACE DEPEND ON IT WHEN FROM THERE YOU MOVE THE WHOLE MASS
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THERE ARE NOT SOME MALE BEINGS WHO ARE WILLING TO PATRONISE US A LITTLE
HENRY BURRAGE AFTER VERENA HAD SHAKEN HER HEAD AT HIM SO SWEETLY AND SADLY RETURNED TO NEW YORK GIVING NO SIGN
WELL I SUPPOSE I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE CONTINUED AT LAST
YOU CAN CARRY THEM ALL THE BIBLES YOU WANT I WANT TO CARRY THEM THE STATUTE-BOOK
RANSOM SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND SAID HE WAS AFRAID HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO MARRY
WHY MISS OLIVE IT'S JUST GOT UP ON PURPOSE FOR ME CRIED THE YOUNG MISSISSIPPIAN RADIANT AND CLASPING HIS HANDS
XVII THE NEXT TIME VERENA SAW OLIVE SHE SAID TO HER THAT SHE WAS READY TO MAKE THE PROMISE SHE HAD ASKED THE OTHER NIGHT
THE IDEA ALWAYS SEEMED TO HER TO KEEP YOU DOWN IF YOU WERE DOWN AND TO HEDGE YOU IN WITH DIFFICULTIES
AND VERENA COULD HAVE NO REJOINDER BUT THE GOOD-HUMOUR THAT SAT IN HER EYES UNABLE AS SHE WAS TO SAY THAT SHE HAD WANTED TO
AND LATER SHE SAID THAT OF COURSE IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND DRAW THE CURTAINS TO AND PASS ONE'S LIFE IN AN ARTIFICIAL ATMOSPHERE WITH ROSE-COLOURED LAMPS
WHY YOU HAVE LED US ALL BY THE NOSE TO WHERE WE ARE NOW
SHE THOUGHT MR PARDON'S VISIT A LIBERTY
MRS LUNA SPOKE WITH PRIDE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WENT THROUGH THEM
SHE TOO HAD SCOURED DIRTY CHILDREN AND IN SQUALID LODGING-HOUSES HAD GONE INTO ROOMS WHERE THE DOMESTIC SITUATION WAS STRAINED AND THE NOISES MADE THE NEIGHBOURS TURN PALE
HE HAD COME CENTURIES TOO SOON
BUT THE IDEA FORMLESS THOUGH IT WAS LED HIM IN A DIRECTION VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE HE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE
TO KEEP HER IDEAL POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GUIDE AND ANIMATE HER MORAL LIFE--THIS WAS A DUTY MORE IMPERATIVE FOR A PARENT SO CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH REVELATIONS AND PANACEAS THAN SEEING THAT SHE FORMED PROFITABLE WORLDLY CONNEXIONS
YOU ARE ON THE WRONG TACK ALTOGETHER
BUT I NEVER HEARD SUCH MONSTROUS SENTIMENTS I MUST PROTEST--I MUST AS A CALUMNIATED MISREPRESENTED MAN
WELL IF YOU LIKE EVERY ONE I HAVEN'T THE LEAST OBJECTION
HE WAS ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD AND WITH HIS HOARY HEAD WAS A THOROUGHLY MODERN YOUNG MAN
HE WAS OFF MOREOVER SO MUCH OF THE TIME THAT HE COULD KEEP LITTLE ACCOUNT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS AND HE HAD AN AIR OF BEING BUT VAGUELY AWARE OF WHOM MISS CHANCELLOR THE OBJECT NOW OF HIS WIFE'S PERPETUAL REFERENCE MIGHT BE
SHE HAD COOKED AND WASHED AND SWEPT AND STITCHED
THAN WHICH INDEED JUDGING FROM HER OWN EXPERIENCE NOTHING COULD WELL HAVE BEEN LESS ADVENTUROUS
MRS TARRANT ASKED THE YOUNG MEN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL ABOUT THEIR STUDIES AND WHETHER THEY MEANT TO FOLLOW THEM UP SERIOUSLY
THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION
SHE ALWAYS SMILED AT IT SHE COULD DO ANYTHING SHE TRIED
AND SHE MENTIONED AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE SUDDEN DREAD THAT HAD COME TO HER THE EVENING BEFORE IN THE CARRIAGE AFTER PROPOSING TO MR RANSOM TO GO WITH HER TO MISS BIRDSEYE'S
AND OF THE VARIOUS REMARKS THAT HAD DROPPED FROM VERENA EXPRESSING THIS QUALITY THAT STARTLING OBSERVATION CERTAINLY EXPRESSED IT MOST
IT WAS GERMAN TO THE MATTER AT ANY RATE FOR HIM TO OBSERVE THAT HE BELIEVED THEY WERE TO HAVE A LECTURE FROM MRS FARRINDER--HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY SHE DIDN'T BEGIN
BOSTON ESPECIALLY WAS STREWN WITH SURPRISES AND HE WAS A MAN WHO LIKED TO UNDERSTAND
THEY THOUGHT EVER SO MUCH OF HIM IN NEW YORK
THEY HAD BROUGHT IN NO MONEY
DON'T PROMISE DON'T PROMISE SHE WENT ON
TO MISS CHANCELLOR SHE WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE COME TO THANK HER FOR HER HOSPITALITY
HE HAD ONLY COME TO CAMBRIDGE FOR THE FORM
DOCTOR PRANCE LOOKED AT HER ACROSS THE ROOM FOR A MOMENT
RANSOM HAD NEVER SEEN ANY THAT WERE SO LONG
HE RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF OLIVE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT SHE HAD DONE OVER THERE WHETHER SHE HAD WORKED THEM UP MUCH
SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE FOR GREAT MOVEMENTS
SHE GRATIFIED HIM AFTER A MOMENT BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT REFUSE WITHOUT APPEARING TO PUT A HURT UPON VERENA
PLEASE BEGIN PLEASE BEGIN
I CAN THANK YOU NOW
THE DEAREST WISH OF MY HEART IS TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT FOR OTHERS--FOR THE MISERABLE BASIL RANSOM MIGHT HAVE GREETED THIS LAST DECLARATION WITH THE SYMPATHY IT DESERVED MIGHT HAVE COMMENDED THE NOBLE ASPIRATIONS OF HIS KINSWOMAN
IT WAS GENERALLY ADMITTED THAT THE STYLE WAS PECULIAR BUT MISS TARRANT'S PECULIARITY WAS THE EXPLANATION OF HER SUCCESS
MISS BIRDSEYE WAS INCAPABLE OF A SPECULATION OF THIS KIND
SHE WOULD MOUNT THE PLATFORM WITH VERENA IF NECESSARY AND LAY HER HANDS UPON HER HEAD
THAT SUCH AN IDEA WAS DARKER THAN ANYTHING THE WORLD CONTAINED
HER HUSBAND ALWAYS HAD TICKETS FOR LECTURES
BY THIS TIME VERENA HAD LEARNED HOW PECULIARLY HER FRIEND WAS CONSTITUTED HOW NERVOUS AND SERIOUS SHE WAS HOW PERSONAL HOW EXCLUSIVE WHAT A FORCE OF WILL SHE HAD WHAT A CONCENTRATION OF PURPOSE
WE HAVE THE HABIT OF ATTENTION AT LECTURES YOU KNOW
OLIVE MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT BUT IT SHALL BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IN REALITY SHE NEVER KNEW BY ANY SENSE OF HER OWN WHETHER VERENA WERE A FLIRT OR NOT
HE STOOD THERE WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING DOWN AT HIS WORK THE CONJUNCTION OF THE TWO LADIES WITH A SMILE
IT WAS A MINUTE BEFORE HE COULD SEE WHO HAD COME OUT AND IN THAT MINUTE HE HAD TIME TO TURN AWAY AND THEN TO TURN BACK AGAIN AND TO WONDER WHICH OF THE TWO INMATES WOULD APPEAR TO HIM OR WHETHER HE SHOULD BEHOLD NEITHER OR BOTH
HIS LIFE ON THE WHOLE HAD NOT BEEN RICH IN EPISODE AND THAT LITTLE CHAPTER OF HIS VISIT TO HIS QUEER CLEVER CAPRICIOUS COUSIN WITH HIS EVENING AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S AND HIS GLIMPSE REPEATED ON THE MORROW OF THE STRANGE BEAUTIFUL RIDICULOUS RED-HAIRED YOUNG IMPROVISATRICE UNROLLED ITSELF IN HIS MEMORY LIKE A PAGE OF INTERESTING FICTION
I HAVE ASKED YOU BEFORE--ARE YOU PREPARED TO GIVE UP DO YOU MEAN TO GIVE YOU UP NO ALL OUR WRETCHED SISTERS--ALL OUR HOPES AND PURPOSES--ALL THAT WE THINK SACRED AND WORTH LIVING FOR OH THEY DON'T WANT THAT OLIVE VERENA'S SMILE BECAME MORE DISTINCT AND SHE ADDED
ABOUT TEN
ONCE HE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN AND THE HEADINGS FIVE OR SIX DEEP DANCED FOR DAYS BEFORE HIS EYES
THEREFORE SHE COULD SAY TO HERSELF WITHOUT THE IMPUTATION OF HEARTLESSNESS THAT WHEN SHE LEFT HER MOTHER IT WAS FOR A NOBLE A SACRED USE
IT WILL BE THE NARROW END OF THE WEDGE I CAN'T TELL WHAT YOU LIKE VERENA SAID STILL LOOKING INTO OLIVE'S EYES
VERENA FELT THAT BY THIS TIME SHE KNEW OLIVE VERY WELL AND HER MOTHER'S MOST COMPLICATED VERSIONS OF MOTIVE AND TEMPERAMENT MRS TARRANT WITH THE MOST IMPERFECT IDEA OF THE MEANING OF THE TERM WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S TEMPERAMENT RENDERED SMALL JUSTICE TO THE PHENOMENA IT WAS NOW HER PRIVILEGE TO OBSERVE IN CHARLES STREET
WHEN THIS MOMENT OF COMBINED RELIEF AND DISMAY ARRIVED ON THE LAST OF THE EVENINGS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH HE TOOK HIS WAY DOWN THIRD AVENUE AND REACHED HIS HUMBLE DWELLING
BUT THE INITIATED READER WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN EVOKING THE SOUND WHICH IS TO BE ASSOCIATED IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE WITH NOTHING VULGAR OR VAIN
SHE HAD BEEN OVER ALL THAT WITH VERENA WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT HER MOTHER WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE HER FOR HER HIGHEST GOOD
HIS BIRTH IN SOME UNHEARD-OF PLACE IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS QUITE INEXPRESSIBLY LOW AND OLIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DISAPPOINTED IF IT HAD BEEN WANTING IN THIS DEFECT
BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS LODGINGS HIS AMBITION HIS RESOLUTION HAD REKINDLED
THAT RICH PECULIAR YOUNG WOMAN SEEMED TO WANT TO LAVISH HERSELF
HE HAD WHIPPED HIM AS HE BELIEVED CONTROVERSIALLY AGAIN AND AGAIN AT POLITICAL MEETINGS IN BLIGHTED SOUTHERN TOWNS DURING THE HORRIBLE PERIOD OF RECONSTRUCTION
WELL OF COURSE I'M YOUNG AND I FEEL BRIGHT ENOUGH WHEN ONCE I GET STARTED
CONVERSATION ON SOME SUBJECT OR OTHER BEING EVIDENTLY A NECESSITY OF HIS NATURE
THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE THAT FRESH FROM THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE
IN BOSTON YOU MUST JUMP AT INVITATIONS
WHETHER EVENTUALLY SHE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT SHE ATTEMPTED THE READER OF HER HISTORY WILL JUDGE
AT ANY RATE THE DARKEST HOUR IS BEFORE THE DAWN
BUT SHE HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT HE WOULD BE TOO GOOD-NATURED PRIMITIVE TO THAT DEGREE
IF THE TYPE SHOULD BECOME FREQUENT SHE WOULD VERY SOON JUDGE IT
BUT HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE MEMORY OF HER SMILE AND TURNED AWAY WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF AFTER ALL AT HAVING GOT OUT OF SUCH WILD COMPANY AS WELL AS WITH IN A DIFFERENT ORDER A VULGAR CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING VERY THIRSTY
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT SAID BASIL RANSOM
SOMETIMES SHE WAS ABJECTLY INDIFFERENT
SHE'S A FEMALE JACOBIN--SHE'S A NIHILIST
WHENEVER MONEY WAS GIVEN HER SHE GAVE IT AWAY TO A NEGRO OR A REFUGEE
IT WAS A SIGN OF CULTURE AND QUIET TASTES
HE WAS A KIND OF EDITOR AND HE WROTE TOO OVER HIS SIGNATURE"--PERHAPS BASIL HAD READ SOME OF HIS WORKS
YOU HATE IT SHE EXCLAIMED IN A LOW TONE
SHE WAS IN LOVE EVEN IN THOSE DAYS ONLY WITH CAUSES AND SHE LANGUISHED ONLY FOR EMANCIPATIONS
HIS MANNER REPRESENTED HOSPITALITY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF THEM AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LISTEN ON THE EDGE OF HER SOFA SHE COULD AT LEAST SEAT HERSELF WHERE SHE LIKED TO HIS EXTRAORDINARY INQUIRY
BUT SHE WISHED TO KNOW THE WORST AT ONCE
THAT QUARTER OF BOSTON IS IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE ACADEMIC SUBURB
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WANTED ONE TO SPEND THE WINTER IN BOSTON
ONLY HE SHOULD HAVE TO REQUEST A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WHILE SHE LISTENED FOR THE VOICE
MR GRACIE IS VERY DIFFERENT
HE STOOD AT THE DOOR WITH AN EXTENDED HAND TO ASSIST THE YOUNG LADY
THEY DON'T CARE FOR US
THEY ARE VERY VOICELESS MRS FARRINDER REMARKED
IT STRUCK EVEN BASIL RANSOM WITH ITS FLATNESS AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HIS COUSIN MUST HAVE A VERY BIG BEE IN HER BONNET TO MAKE HER LIKE SUCH A HOUSE
THAT THERE WERE MANY ABOUT THE WORLD WHO WERE FALSE IMMORAL VILE
THE DOOR THAT ADMITTED HER WAS NOT THE DOOR THAT ADMITTED SOME OF THE OTHERS SHE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THE TIPPED-UP NOSE OF MRS FARRINDER AND THE SUPERIOR PORTAL REMAINED AJAR DISCLOSING POSSIBLE VISTAS
IT WAS NOT THAT VERENA WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THAT--GRACIOUS NO
IT WAS STILL A PART OF THE FAIRY-TALE WHEN THIS ZEALOUS PARENT PUT ON WITH HER OWN HANDS VERENA'S SMART HAT AND FEATHER BUTTONED HER LITTLE JACKET THE BUTTONS WERE IMMENSE AND GILT AND PRESENTED HER WITH TWENTY CENTS TO PAY HER CAR-FARE
WHY WAS SHE MORBID AND WHY WAS HER MORBIDNESS TYPICAL
HE SAW NO REASON TO DISSEMBLE WHEN HE SPOKE OF HER TO HIMSELF AND HE ALLOWED HIMSELF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF FEELING THAT HE SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO SEE HER AGAIN
IT HAD RUBBED OUT THEIR TRANSITIONS THEIR MEANINGS
AFTERWARDS WHEN HIS COUSIN HAD COME BACK AND THEY HAD GONE DOWN TO DINNER TOGETHER WHERE HE SAT FACING HER AT A LITTLE TABLE DECORATED IN THE MIDDLE WITH FLOWERS A POSITION FROM WHICH HE HAD ANOTHER VIEW THROUGH A WINDOW WHERE THE CURTAIN REMAINED UNDRAWN BY HER DIRECTION SHE CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO THIS--IT WAS FOR HIS BENEFIT OF THE DUSKY EMPTY RIVER SPOTTED WITH POINTS OF LIGHT--AT THIS PERIOD I SAY IT WAS VERY EASY FOR HIM TO REMARK TO HIMSELF THAT NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO MAKE LOVE TO SUCH A TYPE AS THAT
THEREFORE SHE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD ADD TO HER SUCCESS IN LIFE TO KNOW A FEW HIGH-FLYERS IF ONLY TO PUT THEM TO SHAME
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO PAY YOUR SISTER ANOTHER VISIT MRS LUNA STARED
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK VERENA TO SPEND A MONTH WITH ME--IT MIGHT BE A WAY OF ATTRACTING YOU TO THE HOUSE ADELINE WENT ON IN THE TONE OF EXUBERANT PROVOCATION
SHE HAD WISHED TO JUDGE DOCTOR TARRANT NOT THAT SHE BELIEVED HE HAD COME HONESTLY BY HIS TITLE TO MAKE UP HER MIND
IT WAS A PART OF THE ROMANCE THE LUXURY OF WEALTH
SHE WAS TALKING WITH SOME LADIES AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE WAY IN WHICH A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN SPOKE TO LADIES AND HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING THAT HE MUST CONDONE HIS BOEOTIAN IGNORANCE HE WAS FOND OF AN ELEGANT PHRASE
IT WAS SLIGHTLY PROVOKING INDEED THAT MRS BURRAGE SHOULD HAVE SO MUCH THE AIR OF A NEW YORKER WHO DIDN'T PARTICULARLY NOTICE WHETHER A BOSTONIAN CALLED OR NOT
HE SAT IN HIS CHAIR TAKING HIS CHANCE OF THE TAX WHICH MRS LUNA MIGHT LAY UPON HIS URBANITY
HE WHISTLED THAT NIGHT AS HE WENT TO BED
OLIVE AND VERENA WERE PRESENT AT ANOTHER OF HER GATHERINGS BEFORE THE WINTER ENDED
BUT PROMISE ME ONE THING AND I SHALL BE--OH SO TENDER WHAT A STRANGE PLACE FOR PROMISES SAID VERENA WITH A SHIVER LOOKING ABOUT HER INTO THE NIGHT
OLIVE KNEW SOME OF THEM AND OF SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD
OF COURSE SOUTHERNERS HAVE PECULIAR VIEWS
EVERYTHING FRESH AND FAIR RENEWED ITSELF IN HER WITH EXTRAORDINARY FACILITY EVERYTHING UGLY AND TIRESOME EVAPORATED AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED HER
SHE SAYS SHE'S THE ONLY WOMAN IN BOSTON THAT HASN'T GOT A DOCTOR
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE NOT TO HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT TO THINK THEY WERE ALL COMFORTABLY ANSWERED SO THAT ONE COULD SIT THERE ON AN OLD SPANISH LEATHER CHAIR WITH THE CURTAINS DRAWN AND KEEPING OUT THE COLD THE DARKNESS ALL THE BIG TERRIBLE CRUEL WORLD--SIT THERE AND LISTEN FOR EVER TO SCHUBERT AND MENDELSSOHN
ON THE FOURTH HE FOUND HE WAS STILL DETAINED
SUCH WERE THE NARROW VIEWS OF PEOPLE HITHERTO SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF OPENING THEIR HEARTS TO ALL SALUTARY NOVELTIES BUT NOW PUT TO A GENUINE TEST AS MRS TARRANT FELT
I HOPE YOU WON'T RIDE TOO FAR--I KNOW MY WAY ROUND BOSTON DON'T OBJECT TO ME OR THINK ME OFFICIOUS RANSOM REPLIED
SHE WAS STAYING AT AN HOTEL IN BOSTON
SHE HAD GOT THE GREAT THING THAT YOU COULDN'T LEARN A KIND OF DIVINE AFFLATUS AS THE ANCIENTS USED TO SAY AND SHE HAD BETTER JUST BEGIN ON THAT
TOGETHER IN SHORT THEY WOULD BE COMPLETE THEY WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING AND TOGETHER THEY WOULD TRIUMPH
OH IT ISN'T ME YOU KNOW
AND MISS CHANCELLOR NEVER LOOKED AT ANYTHING SMALLER THAN THAT
SHE WAS WILLING TO ADMIT THAT WOMEN TOO COULD BE BAD
BUT HER SUSCEPTIBILITY WAS CONSTANTLY BLOOMING AFRESH AND MAKING HER WONDER WHETHER AN ABSENCE OF NICE ARRANGEMENTS WERE A NECESSARY PART OF THE ENTHUSIASM OF HUMANITY
SHE HAD LIVED WITH LONG-HAIRED MEN AND SHORT-HAIRED WOMEN SHE HAD CONTRIBUTED A FLEXIBLE FAITH AND AN IRREMEDIABLE WANT OF FUNDS TO A DOZEN SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS SHE HAD PARTAKEN OF THE COMFORT OF A HUNDRED RELIGIONS HAD FOLLOWED INNUMERABLE DIETARY REFORMS CHIEFLY OF THE NEGATIVE ORDER AND HAD GONE OF AN EVENING TO A SEANCE OR A LECTURE AS REGULARLY AS SHE HAD EATEN HER SUPPER
VERENA SAT THERE SMILING WITHOUT A BLUSH BUT WITH A PURE BRIGHT LOOK WHICH FOR HER WOULD ALWAYS MAKE PROTESTS UNNECESSARY
HERE'S HER FATHER DOCTOR TARRANT--HE HAS A WONDERFUL GIFT--AND HER MOTHER--SHE WAS A DAUGHTER OF ABRAHAM GREENSTREET MISS BIRDSEYE PRESENTED HER COMPANION
THEN CHECKED HER IMPETUOSITY AFTER A GLANCE FROM OLIVE BY ADDING THAT PERHAPS THIS LADY WOULDN'T ASK HER IF SHE KNEW WHAT STRONG GROUND SHE TOOK ON THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN
AND SHE ADDED WITH EVIDENT PLEASURE AT BEING ABLE TO GIVE HER SO AGREEABLE A PIECE OF NEWS THAT SHE HAD DECLINED TO SAY ANYTHING OF THE SORT
ALL THIS DOUBTLESS SOUNDS RATHER DRY AND I HASTEN TO ADD THAT OUR FRIENDS WERE NOT ALWAYS SHUT UP IN MISS CHANCELLOR'S STRENUOUS PARLOUR
OLIVE HAD TAKEN HER UP IN THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE PHRASE LIKE A BIRD OF THE AIR HAD SPREAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PAIR OF WINGS AND CARRIED HER THROUGH THE DIZZYING VOID OF SPACE
IF YOU DON'T TELL HER NO ONE ELSE WILL DO YOU WISH ME TO CONCEAL MURMURED MISS BIRDSEYE PANTING A LITTLE
HE ASKED HER IF SHE KNEW HIS COUSIN MISS CHANCELLOR WHOM HE INDICATED BESIDE MRS FARRINDER
I AM CONSTANTLY FORGETTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US--THAT YOU ARE A MERE CHILD AS YET THOUGH A CHILD DESTINED FOR GREAT THINGS
THEN LOWERING HIS VOICE A LITTLE HE MENTIONED WHAT IT WAS
IT WAS AS PLAIN AS DAY THAT SHE WAS MORBID
WHAT HAVE I DONE I AM NOT ANGRY--I AM ANXIOUS
VERENA'S SHARE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS WAS NOT ACTIVE
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO GET INTO IT IF IT WILL TAKE ME HOME SHE ANSWERED
IS THIS A SOUTH END CAR THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY THE CONDUCTOR ON HIS PERCEIVING MISS BIRDSEYE
AND THE ADVANTAGE FOR THE GIRL OF HAVING A HUSBAND WHO WAS AT THE SAME TIME REPORTER INTERVIEWER MANAGER AGENT WHO HAD THE COMMAND OF THE PRINCIPAL DAILIES WOULD WRITE HER UP AND WORK HER AS IT WERE SCIENTIFICALLY--THE ATTRACTION OF ALL THIS WAS TOO OBVIOUS TO BE INSISTED ON
AND IF THEY WERE TO BE JUDGED AS TRIFLERS THEY MUST BE DEALT WITH INDIVIDUALLY
VERENA WANTED TO KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT BY THIS TIME SHE BELIEVED OLIVE CHANCELLOR TO HAVE IT FOR THE MOST PART IN HER KEEPING
OLIVE AT LEAST TOOK FOR GRANTED THE WING WAS RUFFLED
BUT IT WAS TOO COLD SHE COULD KEEP HER THERE BAREHEADED BUT AN INSTANT
SOME PICTURE OF THE CRUMPLED LITTLE TABLE D'HOTE AT TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF A WEEK WHERE EVERYTHING FELT STICKY WHICH WENT FORWARD IN THE LOW-CEILED BASEMENT UNDER THE CONDUCT OF A COUPLE OF SHUFFLING NEGRESSES WHO MINGLED IN THE CONVERSATION AND INDULGED IN LOW MYSTERIOUS CHUCKLES WHEN IT TOOK A FACETIOUS TURN
BUT CRUDE PRECIPITATE ACTION WAS WHAT BOTH OF THEM LEAST DESIRED
IF SHE CAN WORK A LITTLE TOWARD THAT IT'S ALL SHE ASKS
A DAY OR TWO AFTER THIS MR HENRY BURRAGE LEFT A CARD AT MISS CHANCELLOR'S DOOR WITH A NOTE IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT SHE WOULD TAKE TEA WITH HIM ON A CERTAIN DAY ON WHICH HE EXPECTED THE COMPANY OF HIS MOTHER
ONE THING THEY WERE DETERMINED UPON--THAT MEN SHOULDN'T TAUNT THEM WITH BEING SUPERFICIAL
IT WAS THEY WHO HAD DONE ALL THE WAITING AND TAKEN ALL THE WOUNDS
SHE THOUGHT HIM VERY INFERIOR
HE LET HER KNOW THAT SHE WAS RIGHT-DOWN SELFISH AND THAT IF SHE CHOSE TO SACRIFICE A BEAUTIFUL NATURE TO HER ANTEDILUVIAN THEORIES AND LOVE OF POWER A VIGILANT DAILY PRESS--WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO EXPOSE WRONG-DOING--WOULD DEMAND AN ACCOUNT FROM HER
HERE WAS A RAPACIOUS WOMAN WHO PROPOSED TO KEEP THAT FAVOURABLE SETTING FOR HERSELF
SHE HAD NEVER YET ENCOUNTERED A PERSONAGE SO EXOTIC AND SHE ALWAYS FELT MORE AT HER EASE IN THE PRESENCE OF ANYTHING STRANGE
BUT NOW THE GIRL WAS DISINTERESTEDLY ATTACHED TO THE PRECIOUS THINGS THEY WERE TO DO TOGETHER
HE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL BORED AND HAD OBSERVED EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM ARRIVING AT ALL SORTS OF INGENIOUS INDUCTIONS
VERY LIKELY SHE WOULDN'T SEEM TO HIM THE SAME
OLIVE THINKS SHE'S BORN TO REGENERATE THE WORLD I REMEMBER YOU TELLING ME THAT TOO
HE WAS THE STIFFEST OF CONSERVATIVES AND HIS MIND WAS STEELED AGAINST THE INANITIES SHE UTTERED--THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF WOMEN THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES THE HYSTERICS OF CONVENTIONS THE FURTHER STULTIFICATION OF THE SUFFRAGE THE PROSPECT OF CONSCRIPT MOTHERS IN THE NATIONAL SENATE
BUT AS SHE HAD SEEMED TO HIM NEITHER VERY FRESH NOR VERY BEAUTIFUL SO HE COULD NOT EASILY HAVE REPRESENTED TO HIMSELF WHY SHE SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HER HEAD TO MARRY IT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT THAT SHE WANTED MARRIAGE AN OBSCURE AND PENNILESS MISSISSIPPIAN WITH WOMENKIND OF HIS OWN TO PROVIDE FOR
ALL THIS WAS AS NOTHING HOWEVER COMPARED WITH THE FACT THAT MISS CHANCELLOR SEEMED TO THINK HER YOUNG FRIEND'S GIFT WAS INSPIRATIONAL OR AT ANY RATE AS SELAH HAD SO OFTEN SAID QUITE UNIQUE
HE KNEW THAT WAS A CHARGE THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT AGAINST NEWSPAPER-MEN--THAT THEY WERE RATHER APT TO CROSS THE LINE
THE BOY HAD HAD A GOOD MANY TUTORS SINCE RANSOM GAVE HIM UP AND IT COULD NOT BE SAID THAT HIS EDUCATION LANGUISHED
IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A BETTER TIME I SUPPOSE IT'S NATURAL
I CAN'T PUT THREE WORDS TOGETHER
RANSOM TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO ASK HER WHAT IT WAS SHE HAD STILL TO SAY AND PERHAPS IT WAS TO PREVENT HER TELLING HIM THAT HE NOW BEGAN TO TALK FREELY QUICKLY IN QUITE A NEW TONE
IT WAS WHEN SHE DISCOVERED EXTRAORDINARY THOUGH LATENT LONGINGS ON THE PART OF PEOPLE THEY MET TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE THAT THE GIRL BECAME CONSCIOUS OF HOW MUCH SHE HERSELF HAD STILL TO LEARN
THEIR FACES EXPRESSED A SUSPICION OF HER SOCIAL IMPORTANCE MINGLED WITH CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES AS TO WHETHER IT WERE RIGHT TO RECOGNISE IT
IT WAS ONLY JUST AT THE LAST THAT HE HAD COME IN AND VERENA MUST GO NOW
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD INDEED THAT SHE MUST NOT LIE NOR STEAL
I HAVEN'T SAID HALF I WANTED TO SHE EXCLAIMED
SHE ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING CHANGED AND INQUIRED AS TO THE REASON OF HIS COLDNESS
HE OCCUPIED TWO SMALL SHABBY ROOMS IN A SOMEWHAT DECAYED MANSION WHICH STOOD NEXT TO THE CORNER OF THE SECOND AVENUE
SHE WILL MARRY A CIRCUS-MAN AND MRS LUNA ADDED THAT IT WOULD SERVE OLIVE CHANCELLOR RIGHT
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE GIRL ADMIRED THIS BENEFICENT WOMAN AND FELT IT A PRIVILEGE TO BE NEAR HER
WELL I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE DID
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BREAK DOWN LAST SUMMER AT THE FEMALE CONVENTION MRS LUNA REPLIED
HATED HIM FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH SOMEHOW AS SHE FELT HE HAD LOWERED HER SOCIAL TONE
WELL I AM GLAD WE ARE NOT IN IT WHEREVER WE ARE
WELL NOW IS HE TO BE RESPECTED VERENA DEMANDED AS THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN TOOK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE EARLY DARKNESS PACING QUIETLY SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR WINTER-ROBES LIKE WOMEN CONSECRATED TO SOME HOLY OFFICE
I VERILY BELIEVE THAT BY MISS OLIVE YOU MEAN MISS VERENA HER EYES CHARGED HIM A MOMENT WITH THIS PERVERSE INTENTION
AGES OF OPPRESSION HAD ROLLED OVER THEM
HE HAD SMALL FAIR FEATURES REMARKABLY NEAT AND PRETTY EYES AND A MOUSTACHE THAT HE CARESSED AND AN AIR OF JUVENILITY MUCH AT VARIANCE WITH HIS GRIZZLED LOCKS AND THE FREE FAMILIAR REFERENCE IN WHICH HE WAS APT TO INDULGE TO HIS CAREER AS A JOURNALIST
I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO THINK THAT--AFTER I HAVE TOLD YOU HER ADDRESS IN THIS SECRET WAY A SMILE OF INFINITE MILDNESS GLIMMERED IN MISS BIRDSEYE'S FACE AND SHE ADDED
HER COMPLEXION HAD A KIND OF WITHERED GLAZE
SHE LET IT COME OUT JUST AS IT WOULD--SHE DIDN'T PRETEND TO HAVE ANY CONTROL
YOUR MISSION IS NOT TO EXHIBIT YOURSELF AS A PASTIME FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT TO TOUCH THE HEART OF COMMUNITIES OF NATIONS DEAR MADAM I'M SURE MISS TARRANT WILL TOUCH MY HEART MR BURRAGE OBJECTED GALLANTLY
SHE TRIED TO BRING THE YOUNG SOUTHERNER OUT
THIS WAS THE LIGHT IN WHICH MISS CHANCELLOR HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT NOW SUITED MRS FARRINDER TO REGARD HER
ALL THIS MADE IT INNOCENT FOR VERENA WHOSE LIFE HAD EXPOSED HER TO MUCH WORSE DANGERS
THE WISH OF HIS SOUL WAS THAT HE MIGHT BE INTERVIEWED
HE CARRIED HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE GENERAL ELONGATION OF HIS PERSON OF HIS GESTURES HIS HANDS WERE NOW ALWAYS IN THE AIR AS IF HE WERE BEING PHOTOGRAPHED IN POSTURES OF HIS WORDS AND SENTENCES AS WELL AS IN HIS SMILE AS NOISELESS AS A PATENT HINGE AND IN THE FOLDS OF HIS ETERNAL WATERPROOF
WHAT WE MEAN TO DO WE MEAN TO DO WELL MISS CHANCELLOR SAID TO HER VISITOR WITH CONSIDERABLE STERNNESS
THEY WERE EXCEEDINGLY AFFECTED
I DON'T CARE FOR YOUR PARENTS
IT WAS NOT EITHER THAT MISS BIRDSEYE FAILED TO WANDER ABOUT AMONG THEM WITH REPETITIONS OF INQUIRY AND FRIENDLY ABSENCES OF ATTENTION
AND THEN I HAVE MY WORK YOU KNOW
I CAN'T SLEEP WHEN I WANT TO LIVE YOU OUGHT TO COME DOWN SOUTH THE YOUNG MAN SUGGESTED
MISS CHANCELLOR FELT NONE OF THE REMORSE NOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT SIX MONTHS BEFORE AT STANDING IN THE WAY OF SUCH A CHANCE FOR VERENA AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANGRY IF ANY ONE HAD ASKED HER IF SHE WERE NOT AFRAID OF TAKING TOO MUCH UPON HERSELF
SHE HAD NEVER PRETENDED TO DENY THAT THE HOPE OF FAME OF THE VERY HIGHEST DISTINCTION WAS ONE OF HER STRONGEST INCITEMENTS
WAS NOT BASIL RANSOM AN EXAMPLE OF IT
HE ONLY WORRIED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THOSE WHO WERE NO DOUBT NEARER TO MISS VERENA THAN HE COULD HOPE TO BE WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE
FOR WITH ALL DEFERENCE TO THE DISINTERESTED SOUTHERN ATTITUDE TOWARD THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE WHAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE CAR WITH HER FOR WAS PRECISELY TO MAKE HER TALK
AND THEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF TO INTRODUCE HIM TO DOCTOR PRANCE
HE HAD SEEN VERENA TARRANT ONLY TWICE IN HIS LIFE BUT IT WAS NO USE TELLING HIM THAT SHE WAS AN ADVENTURESS--THOUGH CERTAINLY IT WAS VERY LIKELY SHE WOULD END BY GIVING MISS CHANCELLOR A CUT
DID SHE LOOK AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD RENOUNCED
RANSOM'S CONCEPTION OF VICE WAS PURELY AS A SERIES OF SPECIAL CASES OF EXPLICABLE ACCIDENTS
RANSOM BECAME SO SENSIBLE OF THIS THAT HE FELT IT WAS INDELICATE TO ALLUDE FURTHER TO THE CAUSE OF WOMAN AND FOR A CHANGE ENDEAVOURED TO ELICIT FROM HIS COMPANION SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT
HER HAIR WAS IN CLUSTERS OF CURLS LIKE BUNCHES OF GRAPES
OLIVE HAD ALWAYS RATED HIGH THE NATIVE REFINEMENT OF HER COUNTRY-WOMEN THEIR LATENT ADAPTABILITY THEIR TALENT FOR ACCOMMODATING THEMSELVES AT A GLANCE TO CHANGED CONDITIONS
WITH ALL THIS THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MODERN AND HIGHLY DEVELOPED IN HER ASPECT
THEIR ODIOUS PARTNER HAD TRAMPLED UPON THEM FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND THEIR TENDERNESS THEIR ABNEGATION HAD BEEN HIS OPPORTUNITY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE EVER DONE TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP US OUT OF EVERYTHING
ALL OVER THE WORLD
THAT WAS THE WAY HE LIKED THEM--NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH NOT TO FEEL ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD SUCH AS HE WAS SURE MISS CHANCELLOR FELT
MOSELEY WAS NOT NEGLECTED AS VERENA PASSED HER DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS AND TRIUMPHS HER HUMANISING EFFECT UPON SO MANY HER SERENE AND HONOURED OLD AGE--EXPRESSED IN SHORT AS ONE OF THE LADIES SAID JUST THE VERY WAY THEY ALL FELT ABOUT HER
MISS BIRDSEYE LOOKED ROUND AT THE COMPANY WITH DIM EXULTATION
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TALKS WHICH PEOPLE REMEMBER AFTERWARDS IN WHICH EVERY WORD HAS BEEN GIVEN AND TAKEN AND IN WHICH THEY SEE THE SIGNS OF A BEGINNING THAT WAS TO BE JUSTIFIED
THERE IS AN IMMENSE DESIRE THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSITY TO HEAR YOU AND THERE IS NO SUCH SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE AS AN AUDIENCE OF HARVARD MEN
WHERE DO YOU LIVE OLIVE ASKED
HER MOTIF WAS NOW A KIND OF UNPREPARED TRIBUTE TO MISS BIRDSEYE THE FRUIT OF THE OCCASION AND OF THE UNANIMOUS TENDERNESS OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE CIRCLE WHICH MADE HER A WILLING MOUTHPIECE
WHEN HE JUST CALMED HER DOWN BY LAYING HIS HAND ON HER A FEW MOMENTS IT SEEMED TO COME
SHE WISHED THIS INTERESTING CHILD TO BE PRIVATELY EDUCATED AND IT WOULD BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HAVE IN THAT RELATION A PERSON WHO WAS ALREADY AS IT WERE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
BUT HE QUICKLY DODGED THIS VISION TAKING REFUGE IN A MECHANICAL APPEAL TO HIS COUSIN OF WHOM HE INQUIRED HOW SHE LIKED MISS VERENA
VERENA DID NOT UNDERSTAND FURTHER THAN TO SEE THAT SHE OUGHT ALREADY TO HAVE DEPARTED
HE HAD BEEN SITTING FOR SEVERAL EVENINGS IN A BEER-CELLAR SMOKING HIS PIPE WITH A PROFUNDITY OF RETICENCE
ARE THEY VERY MUCH UNITED THE TWO YOUNG LADIES YOU WOULD SAY SO IF YOU WERE TO SEE MISS CHANCELLOR WHEN VERENA RISES TO ELOQUENCE
HE HELD THAT THEY WERE DELICATE AGREEABLE CREATURES WHOM PROVIDENCE HAD PLACED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE BEARDED SEX
IT HAS LATELY BEEN INTRODUCED IN PARIS
STAND UP AND TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SHE REMARKED WITH SOME STERNNESS TO VERENA WHO ONLY RAISED HER EYES TO HER SILENTLY NOW WITH THE SAME SWEETNESS AND THEN RESTED THEM ON HER FATHER
THEY WERE ALWAYS ROUND AFTER ME DO YOU MEAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEGROES YES I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THEN
HE LINGERED A LITTLE EMBARRASSED BY HER GRIMNESS FOR HE HIMSELF HAD ALWAYS INCLINED TO ROSE-COLOURED VIEWS OF PROGRESS OF THE MARCH OF TRUTH
VERENA WAS NOT ABSTRACT
BUT SHE WOULD TAKE IT HARD
MISS BIRDSEYE MADE HER WAY BACK TO THE GREAT LECTURESS WHO WAS BENDING AN INDULGENT ATTENTION ON MISS CHANCELLOR
IT SEEMED TO HER MOREOVER ONLY JUSTICE THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE SOME CONCESSION
THERE WAS SOMETHING GRAND ABOUT MRS FARRINDER
HE REMARKED HOWEVER THAT A CORRESPONDENT SUFFERED A GOOD DEAL TO-DAY FROM THE COMPETITION OF THE LADY-WRITERS
IT WAS LIKE BEING BORN AGAIN AT ONE'S AGE--ONE HAD TO BEGIN LIFE AFRESH
VERENA WAS A PERFECT LITTLE ADVENTURESS AND QUITE THIRD-RATE INTO THE BARGAIN
SUCH ACCIDENTS HAD NOT HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON HIS REPUTATION
SO THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS PAST WITH HIS INCREASE OF ANXIETY ABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS AND THE LOW PITCH OF HIS SPIRITS HE HAD NOT THOUGHT AT ALL ABOUT VERENA TARRANT
IT MADE THE FIELD MORE FREE THE AIR MORE LIGHT
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR HER TO HAVE SAID THAT FIRST DAY THAT SHE WOULD RENOUNCE
NEITHER FIVE NOR FIFTEEN AND YET NOT TEN EXACTLY BUT EITHER NINE OR ELEVEN
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH BELIEVING THAT SHE WAS AS INNOCENT AS SHE WAS LOVELY AND WITH REGARDING HER AS A VOCALIST OF EXQUISITE FACULTY CONDEMNED TO SING BAD MUSIC
IT HAD BEEN IN HIS THOUGHT THAT MRS FARRINDER TO WHOM HIS COUSIN MIGHT HAVE BETRAYED OR MISREPRESENTED HIM WOULD PERHAPS DEFY HIM TO COMBAT AND HE WONDERED WHETHER HE COULD PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER HE WAS EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED SUFFICIENTLY TO DO HONOUR TO SUCH A CHALLENGE
AND SO FAR AS HENRY BURRAGE WAS CONCERNED HE INTRODUCED AN ELEMENT OF EASY AND CONVENIENT RELAXATION INTO A LIFE NOW A GOOD DEAL STIFFENED OLIVE WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO OWN IT BY GREAT CIVIC PURPOSES
MISS CHANCELLOR OF COURSE HAD HER ANSWER READY
THEY HAD NO WISH TO MAKE MONEY
YOUNG MR PARDON REMARKED IN RANSOM'S HEARING THAT HE KNEW PARTIES WHO IF THEY HAD BEEN PRESENT WOULD WANT TO ENGAGE MISS VERENA AT A HIGH FIGURE FOR THE WINTER CAMPAIGN
RANSOM DEMURRED TO THE IMPLICATION THAT MISS TARRANT WAS FAMOUS
BUT WHAT THE TRUTH MAY BE TO A HUMAN SOUL I THINK PERHAPS EVEN A WOMAN MAY FAINTLY SUSPECT THE TRUTH
SHE'LL COME OUT ALL RIGHT THIS REMARK HE HEARD DROPPED IN A LOW TONE BY THE MESMERIC HEALER
BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN SAID WAS BENIGHTED AND VULGAR
AND IT WAS HER CANDID FAITH THAT IN ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS SHE HAD PRESERVED THE SPIRIT OF THIS INSTITUTION
HE WAS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHERS
SHE SHOULD MEET MEN ON THEIR OWN GROUND
PRANCE SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE BASEMENT AND A PECULIAR LOOK OF BEING BOTH NEW AND FADED--A KIND OF MODERN FATIGUE--LIKE CERTAIN ARTICLES OF COMMERCE WHICH ARE SOLD AT A REDUCTION AS SHOP-WORN
HE HUNG ABOUT SAT TOO LONG TOOK UP THE TIME OF BUSY PEOPLE EDGED INTO THE PRINTING-ROOMS WHEN HE HAD BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE OFFICE TALKED WITH THE COMPOSITORS TILL THEY SET UP HIS REMARKS BY MISTAKE AND TO THE NEWSBOYS WHEN THE COMPOSITORS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS
TARRANT WAS ON THE THRESHOLD
SHE HAD BEEN DIVERTED AGAIN AFTER HER GREETING WITH DOCTOR AND MRS TARRANT BY STOPPING TO INTRODUCE THE TALL DARK YOUNG MAN WHOM MISS CHANCELLOR HAD BROUGHT WITH HER TO DOCTOR PRANCE
AND AT THE IDEA THAT THIS PROCESS HAD BEEN NECESSARY BASIL RANSOM BROKE INTO A SMOTHERED HILARITY A SPASM WHICH INDICATED THAT FOR HIM THE FUN HAD ALREADY BEGUN AND PROCURED HIM ANOTHER GRAVE GLANCE FROM MISS CHANCELLOR
AND MRS LUNA WAS ESTABLISHED IN NEW YORK WHERE SHE HAD TAKEN A HOUSE FOR A YEAR AND WHENCE SHE WROTE TO HER SISTER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ENGAGE BASIL RANSOM WITH WHOM SHE WAS IN COMMUNICATION FOR THIS PURPOSE TO DO HER LAW-BUSINESS
HE HAD BEEN VERY NICE TO NEWTON TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT THE WAR QUITE THE SOUTHERN VERSION OF COURSE BUT MRS LUNA DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS AND SHE WANTED HER SON TO KNOW ALL SIDES AND NEWTON DID NOTHING BUT TALK ABOUT HIM CALLING HIM RANNIE AND IMITATING HIS PRONUNCIATION OF CERTAIN WORDS
MOREOVER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT BOTTOM THEY ARE MISS TARRANT'S OPINIONS RANSOM ADDED
IT WAS A MERE SKETCH OF A SMILE A KIND OF INSTALMENT OR PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT
AND IF SHE SAID IT SHE DOES REALLY HOPE IT
I WAS LITERALLY PASSING HER HOUSE WHEN I MET YOU PERHAPS YOU LIVE HERE NOW SAID MISS BIRDSEYE
MOST OF HER FRIENDS HAD AN ANXIOUS HAGGARD LOOK THOUGH THERE WERE SUNDRY EXCEPTIONS--HALF-A-DOZEN PLACID FLORID FACES
IT WAS A TOPIC ON WHICH HE HAD PROPOSED TO DRAW MISS BIRDSEYE OUT
THAT'S WHAT THEY OUGHT TO DO AND SHE WENT ON TO DECLARE FURTHER THAT SHE THOUGHT THEY ALL TALKED TOO MUCH
SHE KNEW IN ADVANCE JUST THE AIR SHE SHOULD TAKE OR SHE FANCIED SHE KNEW IT--MRS TARRANT'S WERE NOT ALWAYS WHAT SHE SUPPOSED JUST THE NUANCE SHE HAD ALSO AN IMPRESSION SHE KNEW A LITTLE FRENCH OF HER TONE
TO BE LECTURED BY YOU WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE INDEED
MISS BIRDSEYE FELT THIS BUT SHE WAS RATHER HELPLESS ABOUT IT AND DELIVERED HERSELF WITH HER UNIVERSAL FAMILIARITY WHICH EMBRACED EVERY ONE AND EVERYTHING OF A WANDERING AMIABLE TALE IN WHICH ABRAHAM GREENSTREET KEPT REAPPEARING IN WHICH DOCTOR TARRANT'S MIRACULOUS CURES WERE SPECIFIED WITH ALL THE FACTS WANTING AND IN WHICH VERENA'S SUCCESSES IN THE WEST WERE RELATED NOT WITH EMPHASIS OR HYPERBOLE IN WHICH MISS BIRDSEYE NEVER INDULGED BUT AS ACCEPTED AND RECOGNISED WONDERS NATURAL IN AN AGE OF NEW REVELATIONS
AND I AM VERY TIMID DIDN'T YOU FIGHT ONCE YES
FOR SHE WAS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE NEEDED TO BE MORBID EVEN FOR PURPOSES OF SELF-DEFENCE
LOOK HERE MISS OLIVE WHAT DID YOU WRITE TO ME TO COME AND SEE YOU FOR HE MADE THIS INQUIRY WITH A COUNTENANCE NOT DESTITUTE OF GAIETY BUT HIS EYES SHOWED SOMETHING OF THAT YELLOW LIGHT--JUST MOMENTARILY LURID--OF WHICH MENTION HAS BEEN MADE
MRS TARRANT HAD GONE INTO TOWN TO CALL UPON MISS CHANCELLOR
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF YOU THOUGHT IT SO PRETTY THAT TIME IN BOSTON WHEN YOU WALKED ME UP THE HILL RANSOM DECLARED THAT HE REMEMBERED THAT WALK BUT DIDN'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID TO HER
YOU MUST ALLOW ME THE HONOUR OF TAKING YOU HOME MADAM
BUT NOW EVIDENTLY SHE WENT BECAUSE SHE WAS SO MUCH DRAWN
I ALWAYS FEEL IT--EVERYWHERE--NIGHT AND DAY
IT TOOK HIM ONLY A MOMENT TO REFLECT THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL HIM WHERE VERENA TARRANT WAS AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME AND WHERE IF NEED BE HER PARENTS LIVED
MRS FARRINDER AS HE SAID REMAINED WITHIN HER TENT AND HE HAD HOPED NOT ONLY TO SEE THESE DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE BUT ALSO TO LISTEN TO THEM
V MRS FARRINDER MEANWHILE WAS NOT EAGER TO ADDRESS THE ASSEMBLY
BASIL RANSOM COLOURED A LITTLE
IT'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE SHE TOSSED THIS OFF LIGHTLY AS IF SHE WERE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING IT AND OLIVE WONDERED WHETHER IT WERE A SINCERE DISCLAIMER OR ONLY A PHRASE OF THE LIPS
SHE HAS BEEN POWERFULLY AFFECTED MRS FARRINDER EXPLAINED VERY SLIGHTLY DROPPING HER VOICE AS OLIVE APPARENTLY STILL REMAINED DEAF
SHE REMEMBERED SHE OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED BEFORE THAT HE HAD NEVER TAKEN HER IN THE LEAST INTO HIS CONFIDENCE ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS
I FELT THAT I MUST LAST NIGHT AS SOON AS I HEARD YOU SPEAK
SHE IS FULL OF RECTITUDE
BUT SHE HAD LATELY MARRIED TO HIS GREAT AMUSEMENT AND HER HUSBAND HAD TAKEN HER ON A WEDDING-TOUR WHICH WAS TO BE AT THE SAME TIME PROFESSIONAL
SHE COULD NOT HAVE INFORMED YOU WHEREIN IT WOULD PROFIT HER DAUGHTER FOR THE WAY THOSE LADIES SHRANK FROM ANY NEW GOSPEL WAS NOTORIOUS
BUT HER FEATURES THOUGH SHARP AND IRREGULAR WERE DELICATE IN A FASHION THAT SUGGESTED GOOD BREEDING
DON'T YOU BELIEVE THEN IN THE COMING OF A BETTER DAY--IN ITS BEING POSSIBLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE HUMAN RACE POOR RANSOM PERCEIVED THE DEFIANCE AND HE FELT RATHER BEWILDERED
SHE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULDN'T LIKE TO GIVE THE COMPANY SOME ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE SOUTH
SHE APPEALED TO HIS SOUTHERN CHIVALRY AND NOT IN VAIN
IT CAME BACK TO HER THAT THE GIRL HAD A GIFT
MISS CHANCELLOR WAS HISTORIC AND PHILOSOPHIC
I HAVE NOT TAKEN SPACE TO MENTION CERTAIN EPISODES OF THE MORE RECENT INTERCOURSE OF THESE LADIES AND MUST CONTENT MYSELF WITH TRACING THEM LIGHTLY IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES
SHE REFLECTED THAT VERENA WAS NOT IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE A FLIRT THAT SHE WAS ONLY ENCHANTINGLY AND UNIVERSALLY GENIAL THAT NATURE HAD GIVEN HER A BEAUTIFUL SMILE WHICH FELL IMPARTIALLY ON EVERY ONE MAN AND WOMAN ALIKE
IT WAS NOT INDEED THAT OLIVE'S RESENTMENT FADED QUITE AWAY
THAT WAS WHERE THE SHOE PINCHED--THAT WAS WHERE SELAH WAS SLIM
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD MARRY A GENTLEMAN WHO WOULD BE SILENT ON THE PLATFORM THIS WAS HER MOST GENERAL HUMILIATION
BUT HE COULD NOT PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT THROUGH THIS MEDIUM HIS PERSONALITY HAD ATTRACTED GENERAL ATTENTION
I SHOULD BE DISHONEST IF I LET YOU THINK I DID WHY OLIVE CHANCELLOR VERENA MURMURED AS IF SHE WERE TRYING IN SPITE OF THE SADNESS PRODUCED BY THIS DECLARATION TO DO JUSTICE TO HER FRIEND'S IMPARTIALITY
MRS LUNA DECLARED THAT IF SHE MUST BE TRAMPLED UPON--AND VERY LIKELY IT WAS HER FATE!--SHE WOULD RATHER BE TRAMPLED UPON BY MEN THAN BY WOMEN AND THAT IF OLIVE AND HER FRIENDS SHOULD GET POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT THEY WOULD BE WORSE DESPOTS THAN THOSE WHO WERE CELEBRATED IN HISTORY
HE EVIDENTLY REPRESENTED NOTHING TO HER BUT A SENTIENT FELLOW-CITIZEN IN THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS RIGHTS WHICH INCLUDED THAT OF STARING
HE HAD PERCEIVED VERY SOON THAT SHE WAS A TREMENDOUSLY FAMILIAR LITTLE WOMAN--THAT SHE TOOK MORE RAPIDLY THAN HE HAD EVER KNOWN A HIGH DEGREE OF INTIMACY FOR GRANTED
THE TIME HADN'T COME WHEN A LADY-DOCTOR WAS SENT FOR BY A GENTLEMAN AND SHE HOPED IT NEVER WOULD THOUGH SOME PEOPLE SEEMED TO THINK THAT THIS WAS WHAT LADY-DOCTORS WERE WORKING FOR
HE WAS A MESMERIC HEALER AND SHE WAS OF OLD ABOLITIONIST STOCK
I DON'T THINK YOU BELONG ROUND HERE MISS BIRDSEYE DECLARED AS THEY PROCEEDED
ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW ME SOME I CAN SHOW YOU AN EARNEST EFFORT TOWARDS IT
OH DEAR NO I CAN'T SPEAK
HE COULD SPEAK TO THAT PRETTY GIRL WHO HAD JUST COME IN--THE ONE WITH RED HAIR--IF HE LIKED
TILL WITHIN A SHORT TIME THERE HAD BEEN A RESOURCE FOR HIM AT SUCH AN HOUR AND IN SUCH A MOOD
HE SHOULD THINK HE HAD BEEN
SHE ANSWERED ALL HER FRIEND'S QUESTIONS WITH A GOOD-NATURE WHICH EVIDENTLY TOOK NO PAINS TO MAKE THINGS PLAUSIBLE AN EFFORT TO OBLIGE NOT TO PLEASE
AS THEY WERE THE WEAKEST MOST HAD BEEN WRUNG FROM THEM AND AS THEY WERE THE MOST GENEROUS THEY HAD BEEN MOST DECEIVED
SHE HAD TOLD THEM ALL THAT SHE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE THEM IN HER HOME BUT THEY HAD NOT YET PICKED THEIR WAY ALONG THE LITTLE PLANKS OF THE FRONT YARD
THEY TALKED NATURALLY MORE WITH VERENA THAN WITH HER MOTHER
BUT SHE SAYS THIS HAS MORE NATURE THAN MOST
THAT WAS NOT THE SOUTHERN WAY AND HE WAS AT LEAST AS PROUD AS HE WAS POOR
OF COURSE SHE KNEW PRINCIPALLY LADIES
BUT DON'T FAIL ME--DON'T FAIL ME OR I SHALL DIE HER MANNER OF REPAIRING HER INCONSISTENCY WAS ALTOGETHER FEMININE
IT WAS JUST BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR EUROPE
WERE NOT CAR-TICKETS TO HEAR MRS ADA T
FOR MRS LUNA WHEN THEY REACHED BEACON STREET WOULD NOT HEAR OF HIS LEAVING HER TO GO HER WAY ALONE WOULD NOT IN THE LEAST ADMIT HIS PLEA THAT HE HAD ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO MORE IN BOSTON HE WAS TO TRAVEL ECONOMICALLY BY THE BOAT AND MUST DEVOTE THE TIME TO HIS BUSINESS
HE WAS PERSISTENT AND PENETRATING HE WAS KNOWN AS THE IRREPRESSIBLE TARRANT
BASIL RANSOM HAD ALREADY NOTICED DOCTOR PRANCE
YOUR STAR IS ABOVE YOU
OLIVE HAD GOT HERSELF OUT OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH A SORT OF BLIND DEFIANT DASH
OUR TWO YOUNG WOMEN HAD PLENTY OF DUTIES BUT OLIVE HAD NEVER FAVOURED THE CUSTOM OF RUNNING IN AND OUT
A COMMON END UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER FINE AS REGARDS A SPECIAL RESULT DOES NOT MAKE COMMUNITY IMPERSONAL
ARE YOU EVER DIFFERENT FROM THIS MRS LUNA WAS FAMILIAR--INTOLERABLY FAMILIAR
I AM GLAD I HAVEN'T OPINIONS THAT PREVENT MY DRESSING IN THE EVENING SHE DECLARED FROM THE DOORWAY
THOUGH HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THE EFFECT OF HIS TONE WAS TO DISPEL HER SHYNESS
HE HAD COME TO SEE HER ONLY BECAUSE SHE WROTE TO HIM
IF THEY WERE CALLED THEY WOULD KNOW IT
AFTER THAT THE REST DIDN'T MATTER
YES THAT'S WHAT I LIKE YOU FOR MRS LUNA REMARKED SWEETLY
YOU HAD TO BE LIVELY IF YOU WANTED TO GET THERE FIRST
IT'S JUST OLIVE CHANCELLOR
IT WAS NATURAL THAT AT THE SEAT OF A BIG UNIVERSITY THERE SHOULD BE GIRLS LIKE THAT WITH STUDENTS DANGLING AFTER THEM BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT VERENA TO BE ONE OF THEM
WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE JUDGES YOU YOUNG MEN FAIRLY SAID MRS TARRANT WITH A SIGH
AND THIS THOUGHT AFTER A WHILE GAVE OLIVE A GREATER SENSE OF SECURITY
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD CARE WHAT YOU THINK SHE SAID
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE MIGHT STOP IT WE MIGHT INVENT SOMETHING BETTER
OLIVE WISHED MORE AND MORE TO EXTRACT SOME DEFINITE PLEDGE FROM HER
IF YOU STAY I WON'T SPEAK SHE ADDED
SHE IS A GROWING POWER SINCE HER GREAT SUCCESS AT THE CONVENTION AH
SHE HAD SAID AT FIRST THAT SHE COULDN'T GIVE UP HER MOTHER BUT SHE HAD BEEN MADE TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF GIVING UP
IT WAS ABOUT SUCH MATTERS AS THESE AND BASIL RANSOM WAS DELIGHTED TO OBSERVE THAT SUCH MATTERS AS THESE DIDN'T SPOIL IT
SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT AGAIN TO BE FANTASTIC AS SHE HAD BEEN ABOUT HIS COMING TO MISS BIRDSEYE'S
FOR MISS VERENA
IT WAS THEY WHO SAT CRAMPED AND CHAINED TO RECEIVE IT
IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I WANTED TO JOIN IN
HE HAD FORMED A PARTNERSHIP WITH A PERSON WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO REPAIR SOME OF HIS DEFICIENCIES--A YOUNG MAN FROM RHODE ISLAND ACQUAINTED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN EXPRESSION WITH THE INSIDE TRACK
BUT THE TOUCH OF OLIVE'S TONE WORKED A SPELL AND SHE FOUND SOMETHING TO WHICH AT LEAST A PORTION OF HER NATURE TURNED WITH EAGERNESS IN HER COMPANION'S WIDER KNOWLEDGE HER ELEVATION OF VIEW
THE GREAT APOSTLE OF THE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN
YOU HAD BETTER GO THERE YOURSELF I SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER SAID RANSOM
SHE DETERMINED HOWEVER TO MAKE IT PROMISING HERSELF THAT HER FIRST VISIT TO MRS TARRANT SHOULD ALSO BE HER LAST
IT WAS A PART OF HIS ATTITUDE IN LIFE NEVER TO APPEAR TO BE INDEBTED TO ANOTHER PERSON FOR A SUGGESTION NEVER TO BE SURPRISED OR UNPREPARED
SHE HAD A STRANGE SENSE TOO THAT HER FRIEND HAD NEGLECTED HER FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR HAD NOT BEEN OCCUPIED WITH HER HAD PLACED A BARRIER BETWEEN THEM--A BARRIER OF BROAD MALE BACKS OF LAUGHTER THAT VERGED UPON COARSENESS OF GLANCING SMILES DIRECTED ACROSS THE ROOM DIRECTED TO OLIVE WHICH SEEMED RATHER TO DISCONNECT HER WITH WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD ON THAT SIDE THAN TO INVITE HER TO TAKE PART IN IT
SO FRESH AND POETICAL
I DON'T KNOW--I NEVER SAW ANY
WHEREAS MISS BIRDSEYE HAD ONLY A BARE VULGAR ROOM WITH A HIDEOUS FLOWERED CARPET IT LOOKED LIKE A DENTIST'S A COLD FURNACE THE EVENING PAPER AND DOCTOR PRANCE
I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO TEACH ME WHAT A WOMAN CAN DO DOCTOR PRANCE DECLARED
AND THEN--WON'T VERENA TELL HER I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT--BUT I HOPE NOT SHE TELLS HER MOST EVERYTHING
SOMETIMES THEY EXCITED REMORSE AND SOMETIMES TRIUMPH
I REGARD ELIZA AS THE CAUSE OF THE BIGGEST WAR OF WHICH HISTORY PRESERVES THE RECORD BASIL RANSOM ENJOYED HIS HUMOUR THE MORE BECAUSE VERENA APPEARED TO ENJOY IT
OF SEEING THINGS NOT SIMPLY AND SHARPLY BUT IN PERVERSE RELATIONS IN INTERTWISTED STRANDS
IF AS YOU SAY THERE IS TO BE A DISCUSSION THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT SIDES AND OF COURSE ONE CAN'T SYMPATHISE WITH BOTH YES BUT EVERY ONE WILL IN HIS WAY--OR IN HER WAY--PLEAD THE CAUSE OF THE NEW TRUTHS
THE GIRL SLOWLY GOT UP
SHE HATED HER HUSBAND FOR HAVING MAGNETISED HER SO THAT SHE CONSENTED TO CERTAIN THINGS AND EVEN DID THEM THE THOUGHT OF WHICH TO-DAY WOULD SUDDENLY MAKE HER FACE BURN
SHE HAD FALLEN INTO IT NATURALLY AND GRACEFULLY IN THE COURSE OF TALK AND POURED OUT A STREAM OF ELOQUENCE EVEN MORE TOUCHING THAN HER REGULAR DISCOURSE AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S
THE WHITE PUFFY MOTHER WITH THE HIGH FOREHEAD IN THE CORNER THERE LOOKED MORE LIKE A LADY
MRS FARRINDER WILL THANK HER FOR THE COMPANY HE SAID LAUGHING BUT SHE WON'T THANK HER FOR ME MISS BIRDSEYE MANIFESTED THE GREATEST DISPOSITION TO OBLIGE HIM
I HAVEN'T MADE YOU PROMISE HALF THE THINGS I WANT YET
THE FIRE WITH WHICH SHE GLOWED CAME FROM WITHIN
I THOUGHT HER VERY CHARMING DIDN'T YOU THINK HER VERY REASONABLE GOD FORBID MADAM
HER WHITE SKIN HAD A SINGULAR LOOK OF BEING DRAWN TIGHTLY ACROSS HER FACE
I WILL DROP RIGHT OUT IF I DON'T SEEM TO VITALISE
BUT THE MANNER OF NEW YORK COULD NOT BE ACQUIRED BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE SOMEHOW WAS NOT IN THIS CASE CONTAGIOUS
SELAH TARRANT
THE MORE SO THAT EVEN WHEN SHE TRIED MOST VERENA REPROACHED HER--SO FAR AS VERENA'S INCURABLE SOFTNESS COULD REPROACH--WITH NOT ALLOWING ENOUGH
BUT MRS FARRINDER DIDN'T APPEAR TO CARE ANYTHING FOR THAT OR INDEED TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT HISTORY AT ALL
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE ALL THAT PRETTY MOONSHINE YOU TALKED LAST NIGHT
SHE WAS DETERMINED SHE WOULDN'T BE A PATIENT AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE ONLY WAY NOT TO BE ONE WAS TO BE A DOCTOR
SHE WAS TOO RANCOURLESS TOO DETACHED FROM CONVENTIONAL STANDARDS TOO FREE FROM PRIVATE SELF-REFERENCE
ASK MY SISTER--I THINK SHE WILL TELL YOU SAID OLIVE TURNING AWAY FROM HIM AND GOING TO THE WINDOW
AND IF THEY WEREN'T THEY COULD JUST HOLD ON TO EACH OTHER AS THEY HAD ALWAYS DONE
OF COURSE ANY SUCH GIVING IN WOULD BE VERY AWKWARD FOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SHRIEKED OUT ON PLATFORMS THAT OLD MAIDS WERE THE HIGHEST TYPE
MOREOVER HE FELT THAT ANY GENTLEMAN WHO SHOULD LEAD HER TO SUCCESS WOULD WIN HER ESTEEM
NEITHER OF THEM IS UP TO THE STANDARD AND ON RANSOM'S ASKING HER WHAT THE STANDARD APPEARED TO HER TO BE SHE SAID WELL THEY OUGHT TO LIVE BETTER
YOU SEE IF SHE IS NOT WHEN YOU KNOW HER
IN POINT OF FACT SHE LEFT HER VERY LITTLE AND SHE SPENT HOURS IN JINGLING ACHING JOSTLED JOURNEYS BETWEEN CHARLES STREET AND THE STALE SUBURBAN COTTAGE
IT WAS GIVEN ME BY MIRANDOLA HE HAD BEEN ONE OF HER REFUGEES IN THE OLD TIME WHEN TWO OR THREE OF HER FRIENDS ACQUAINTED WITH THE LIMITS OF HIS RESOURCES WONDERED HOW HE HAD COME INTO POSSESSION OF THE TRINKET
AND MOREOVER THE SHEET AS HE SAID WAS PLAYED OUT ANYWAY
ONE OF THEM WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SIMPLEST DIVISION IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE OF THE HUMAN RACE IS INTO THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THINGS HARD AND THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THEM EASY
SHE ONLY CARED AS YET FOR OUTSIDE THINGS
THE MORE OLIVE LEARNT OF HER VISITOR'S LIFE THE MORE SHE WANTED TO ENTER INTO IT THE MORE IT TOOK HER OUT OF HERSELF
HER FAVOURS WERE GENERAL NOT PARTICULAR
XVI MR PARDON AS OLIVE OBSERVED WAS A LITTLE OUT OF THIS COMBINATION
IT SEEMED ALMOST TO SEAL THE FUTURE
SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT SINCE HE HATED WOMEN WHO RESPECTED THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER DESTINY WOULD USE HIM RIGHTLY IN HANGING A PERSON LIKE ADELINE ROUND HIS NECK
SHE HAD LONG FOLLOWED WITH SYMPATHY THE MOVEMENT FOR THE LIBERATION OF HER SEX FROM EVERY SORT OF BONDAGE
THIS CARRIED THEM OUT OF HIS RANGE SPOILED THE PERSPECTIVE DIMINISHED THEIR ACTUALITY
IT'S BEAUTIFUL THE WAY SHE DRAWS YOU OUT VERENA HAD SAID TO HER MOTHER
IN MOMENTS OF IRRITATION AT THE WANT OF A CERTAIN SEQUENCE IN THEIR CAREER SHE HAD REMARKED TO HIM THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING HE DID HAVE
IF HIS WIFE ASKED HIM AT DINNER IF THE POTATOES WERE GOOD HE REPLIED THAT THEY WERE STRIKINGLY FINE HE USED TO SPEAK OF THE NEWSPAPER AS FINE"--HE APPLIED THIS TERM TO OBJECTS THE MOST DISSIMILAR AND EMBARKED ON A PARALLEL WORTHY OF PLUTARCH IN WHICH HE COMPARED THEM WITH OTHER SPECIMENS OF THE SAME VEGETABLE
WELL I DON'T KNOW AS I OUGHT TO SAY THAT I'M ACQUAINTED WITH HER
THEY HAD GOT TO OWN UP TO IT MISS CHANCELLOR COULD DO MORE WITH HER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
THEY WERE SUPERABUNDANTLY CRUDE AS YET--HAPPILY FOR OLIVE WHO PROMISED HERSELF AS WE KNOW TO TRAIN AND POLISH THEM--BUT THEY WERE AS GENUINE AS FRUIT AND FLOWERS AS THE GLOW OF THE FIRE OR THE PLASH OF WATER
VERENA ACCEPTED ALL THIS FOR SHE WAS YOUNG ENOUGH TO ENJOY ANY JOURNEY IN A HORSE-CAR AND SHE WAS EVER-CURIOUS ABOUT THE WORLD
BUT THIS BENEFICENT EPISTLE NEVER APPEARED AND NOW OLIVE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO FAVOUR TO COME FROM THE PROPHETESS OF ROXBURY
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD AT PEOPLE'S DOORS THAT SHE COULD NOT BE RECEIVED BECAUSE THE LADY OF THE HOUSE HAD A VISITOR AND SHE HAD RETIRED ON THESE OCCASIONS WITH A FEELING OF AWE MUCH MORE THAN A SENSE OF INJURY
TARRANT WISHED TO GUIDE HER DOWN THE STEPS OUT OF THE LITTLE YARD TO HER CARRIAGE
HE WAS VERY PLEASANT AND HE KNEW AN IMMENSE DEAL ABOUT EVERYTHING OR RATHER ABOUT EVERY ONE AND HE WOULD TAKE HER RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF LIFE
WELL PERHAPS AFTER ALL I HAVE A GENERAL IDEA HE CONFESSED
SHE SAT THERE WITH HER SPECTRAL FACE
AND THIS REFLEXION ADDED AS I SAY TO HIS HABITUALLY SACERDOTAL EXPRESSION
BUT THEY HAD FAITH THAT WHETHER ONE RAISED ONE'S VOICE OR SIMPLY WORKED ON IN SILENCE THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WOULD STRAIGHTEN THEMSELVES OUT
THIS WAS TRUE SO FAR AS IT WENT
THE PLACE FOR HIM IN OLIVE'S EYES WAS ONE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE WOULD TEACH HIM HIS SMALL IMPORTANCE TEACH IT IF NECESSARY BY THE AID OF AN OCCASIONAL DRUBBING
IF PEOPLE WATCHED HER A GOOD DEAL SHE ALSO RETURNED THEIR CONTEMPLATION AND HER CHARMING EYES HAD SEVERAL TIMES ENCOUNTERED THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM
IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HE COULDN'T CALL UPON VERENA WITHOUT CALLING UPON OLIVE HE SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THAT CONDITION IF HE CALLED UPON MRS TARRANT
THE FACT REMAINED AT ANY RATE THAT VERENA HAD MADE A SACRIFICE
DISEASE AND WICKEDNESS AND WARS
THE PROCESS WENT ON A LONG TIME BEFORE HE BECAME AWARE OF IT
SAID SHE THOUGHT SOME OF THE LAWS WERE VERY UNJUST AND SHE HOPED THEY MEANT TO TRY AND IMPROVE THEM
TO MY PARENTS OH NO NOT YOUR PARENTS MISS CHANCELLOR REPLIED WITH SOME SHARPNESS
IT WAS SHE OFTENEST WHO KEPT IN VIEW THE FACT THAT A GOOD MANY WOMEN IN THE PAST HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH POWER AND HAD NOT ALWAYS USED IT AMIABLY WHO BROUGHT UP THE WICKED QUEENS THE PROFLIGATE MISTRESSES OF KINGS
BUT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WOULD NOT SERVE HER PURPOSE NEARLY SO WELL
SHE HAD A DINGY LOOSELY-HABITED AIR AS IF SHE HAD WORN HER CLOTHES FOR MANY YEARS AND YET WAS EVEN NOW IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
HE ADDED PRESENTLY THAT HE SUPPOSED HE SHOULD HAVE TO FIX IT WITH MIS TARRANT
AND AS THE HOST AND MOST OF THE GUESTS WERE GERMAN AND THEIR COLLOQUIAL TONGUE WAS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE WAS NOT DRAWN INTO ANY UNDUE EXPENDITURE OF SPEECH
YOU DON'T THINK HIM PLAIN
THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT MOST OF HER GUESTS WERE AS IMPECUNIOUS AS HERSELF
SHE DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF WHAT SHE SPENT IN CAR-TICKETS AND INDEED SHE HAD TOLD HER THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WANTED TO STUFF HER POCKETS WITH THEM
BUT IT SUITED HER JUST THEN TO MAKE THIS ASSUMPTION WHICH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SINCERE
SHE WAS STARTLED DISCONCERTED BUT AS I HAVE SAID SHE WAS RIGOROUSLY LADY-LIKE
YET IF SHE HAD BEEN AFRAID HE WOULD SHOW SOME IRRITATION AT THIS NEWS SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THE GENIALITY WITH WHICH HE EXCLAIMED
THIS CONSISTED IN VERENA'S COMING IN TO CHARLES STREET TO STAY WITH HER IN PURSUANCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT ON OLIVE'S PART WITH SELAH TARRANT AND HIS WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD REMAIN FOR MANY MONTHS
VERENA WAS SURE ALSO BUT SHE WOULDN'T GO ALONE AND SHE WANTED OLIVE TO GO WITH HER
I PRETEND NOT TO PREVARICATE DEAR ME WHAT'S THE GOOD OF BEING A SOUTHERNER THE LADY ASKED
THEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT HAD BEEN CONNECTED IN SOME WAY WITH MRS FARRINDER
HE WOULD TELL HER ABOUT MISSISSIPPI AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED
HER TONE SUGGESTED THAT A CERTAIN CREDIT BELONGED TO HER FOR THE WAY SHE CARRIED OUT HER ASSURANCE
THERE WAS AS LITTLE COMFORT FOR OLIVE AS THERE HAD BEEN ON THE WHOLE ALARM IN THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT OFF-HAND SPEECH OF VERENA'S ABOUT HER PREFERENCE FOR FREE UNIONS THIS HAD BEEN MERE MAIDEN FLIPPANCY
OF COURSE ALL GIRLS DIDN'T DO IT
THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS OF THE KIND KNOWN TO NEW YORKERS AS A DUTCH GROCERY
SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT SHE HAD BEEN STUFFED WITH THIS TRASH BY HER FATHER AND SHE WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS WILLING TO SAY IT THAN TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE
UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST SARCASTIC INQUIRY THAT COULD OCCUR TO HER AS A RESPONSE WAS ALSO THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE SO THAT HE HESITATED BUT A MOMENT WITH HIS REJOINDER AFTER SHE HAD ASKED HIM HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HE EXPECTED TO MAKE
THEN SHE SURPRISED HER DAUGHTER BY A VOLUBILITY OF EXHORTATION AS TO THE DUTY OF MAKING ACQUAINTANCES AND BY THE APPARENT WEALTH OF HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE MYSTERIES OF GOOD SOCIETY
IF SO YOU KNOW HOW CRISP I AM HEARD YOU
HUMAN LIFE CEASED TO BE A BATTLE
GRACIE AND I ARE ONLY TWO BUT GRACIE IS A HOST IN HIMSELF AND I AM SURE HE WILL SAY AS MUCH OF ME THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE THESE WORDS FREELY AND LIGHTLY SMILING AT VERENA AND EVEN A LITTLE AT OLIVE WITH THE AIR OF ONE TO WHOM A MASTERY OF CLEVER CHAFF WAS COMMONLY ATTRIBUTED
OH INDEED
THIS MADE HER WISH THE MORE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD GRATIFY OLIVE
HE THOUGHT IT TALKATIVE QUERULOUS HYSTERICAL MAUDLIN FULL OF FALSE IDEAS OF UNHEALTHY GERMS OF EXTRAVAGANT DISSIPATED HABITS FOR WHICH A GREAT RECKONING WAS IN STORE
FOR VERENA TOO SHE WAS A PICTURESQUE HUMANITARY FIGURE
SHE'S A HIGH-CLASS SPEAKER WHAT DO YOU MEAN OLIVE ASKED
I'M SURE MISS CHANCELLOR LIKES EVERYTHING HERE MRS TARRANT REMARKED WITH A NOBLE CONFIDENCE
IN FRONT OF THE MUSIC HALL AND OF TREMONT TEMPLE HE STOPPED LOOKING AT THE POSTERS IN THE DOORWAY
I HAVE SEVERAL NAMES THAT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU NAMES WELL KNOWN ON STATE STREET
A LOCAL REPUTATION DOUBTLESS SHE HAD BUT THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HER THEN WAS TO BECOME A FIRST-CLASS NATIONAL GLORY
HE READ IT FOR FIVE MINUTES IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE-LOOKING ATTITUDE AND QUITE FORGOT THAT HE HAD BEEN FORSAKEN
YOU WERE TOO AFRAID OF THEM TO LET THEM COME THERE SHE WAS NOW TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING SHE MIGHT SAY THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY DISAGREEABLE TO MAKE HIM CEASE TO INSIST ON ACCOMPANYING HER
I HAVE FAR TOO MUCH OF THAT
SHE CAME OUT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SWEETNESS--WITH A VERY QUAINT AND PECULIAR EFFECT
MRS TARRANT IN OTHER WORDS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF HER FAMILY WHO GAVE HER HUSBAND TO UNDERSTAND THAT MUCH AS THEY DESIRED TO REMOVE THE SHACKLES FROM THE SLAVE THERE WERE KINDS OF BEHAVIOUR WHICH STRUCK THEM AS TOO UNFETTERED
THEY CARED FAR MORE ABOUT CHARLIE THAN ABOUT THE BALLOT
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH SEXES
WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE WOMEN OF THE SOUTH
AND YET THERE WAS A STRANGE SPONTANEITY IN HER MANNER AND AN AIR OF ARTLESS ENTHUSIASM OF PERSONAL PURITY
DOUBTLESS SOME MAGAZINE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TO PRINT THEM
SHE ONLY TURNED AWAY SLOWLY TOWARDS HER MOTHER SMILING OVER HER SHOULDER AT THE WHOLE ROOM AS IF IT HAD BEEN A SINGLE PERSON WITHOUT A FLUSH IN HER WHITENESS OR THE NEED OF DRAWING A LONGER BREATH
THEY WERE PITCHED AS SELAH'S NATURE WAS PITCHED ALTOGETHER IN THE KEY OF PUBLIC LIFE
VERENA HAD REPLIES FOR A GOOD MANY OF THEM AND A PRETTY COLOUR CAME INTO HER FACE AS SHE TALKED
WITH HER GRACE AND BEAUTY HER GENERAL STYLE HOW COULD SHE HELP THAT BUT DID SHE BRING THEM ROUND DID SHE SWELL THE HOST THAT IS PREPARED TO MARCH UNDER HER BANNER I SUPPOSE SHE SAW PLENTY OF THE STRONG-MINDED PLENTY OF VICIOUS OLD MAIDS AND FANATICS AND FRUMPS
THE LADIES MRS FARRINDER MEANT IT WAS TO BE SUPPOSED SHE MEANT SOME PARTICULAR ONES MIGHT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
WELL JUST A LITTLE
SHE TOOK THEM MORE TRAGICALLY THEN THEY TOOK THEMSELVES
THE WRITER WAS PERSONAL THE PERSON FOOD FOR NEWSBOYS AND EVERYTHING AND EVERY ONE WERE EVERY ONE'S BUSINESS
WELL SHE REPLIED I GUESS I HAVE THOUGHT MORE THAN I APPEAR DO YOU UNDERSTAND GERMAN
HE FELT THERE WAS MONEY IN THE AIR
P
DO YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY CRUEL TO ME
WELL MISS OLIVE HE ANSWERED PUTTING ON AGAIN HIS BIG HAT WHICH HE HAD BEEN HOLDING IN HIS LAP WHAT STRIKES ME MOST IS THAT THE HUMAN RACE HAS GOT TO BEAR ITS TROUBLES THAT'S WHAT MEN SAY TO WOMEN TO MAKE THEM PATIENT IN THE POSITION THEY HAVE MADE FOR THEM OH THE POSITION OF WOMEN BASIL RANSOM EXCLAIMED
I BEG YOU TO BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD DO FOR ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD THAT I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU HE SAID BENDING FOR THE LAST TIME OVER MRS LUNA'S PLUMP HAND
I LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL AS AN INCARNATION OF A MOVEMENT RANSOM THOUGHT HER MORE AND MORE SINGULAR AND HE WONDERED HOW SHE CAME TO BE CLOSETED SO SOON WITH HIS KINSWOMAN TO WHOM ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN A COMPLETE STRANGER
IN HER RESEARCHES AMONG HER YOUNG TOWNSWOMEN SHE HAD ALWAYS FOUND THIS OBTRUSIVE SWAIN PLANTED IN HER PATH AND SHE GREW AT LAST TO DISLIKE HIM EXTREMELY
SHE BELIEVED MR PARDON SOMETIMES WROTE IN THE TRANSCRIPT
DO YOU MEAN THE--A--RATHER STRIKING YOUNG LADY WHOM I MET IN BOSTON A YEAR AGO LAST OCTOBER
BUT SHE SEEMED TO HESITATE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT I WANT TO KNOW YOU OLIVE SAID
DOES IT SHOULD YOU SAY--OUR SCHEME OF WORK I AM AFRAID THE DISTRACTION WE HAVE HAD THIS AFTERNOON MUST LAST US FOR A LONG TIME OLIVE SAID WITHOUT HARSHNESS BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE MAJESTY
THEREFORE HE COULD ONLY GUESS THAT SHE WAS A RICH YOUNG WOMAN
THE HOUSE HAD A RED RUSTY FACE AND FADED GREEN SHUTTERS OF WHICH THE SLATS WERE LIMP AND AT VARIANCE WITH EACH OTHER
HE STOOD THERE A MOMENT WONDERING
BUT THIS PALE GIRL WITH HER LIGHT-GREEN EYES HER POINTED FEATURES AND NERVOUS MANNER WAS VISIBLY MORBID
HE PAUSED A MOMENT BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM--STANDING THERE WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR
HERE IS YOUR CAR AT LAST WELL I BELIEVE IN THE VICTORY OF THE TRUTH
IT HAD LONG BEEN FAMILIAR TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO COUNT WITH THE OBSTINACY OF THE WORLD AT LARGE BUT SHE NOW DISCOVERED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO COUNT ALSO WITH CERTAIN ELEMENTS IN THE FEMININE CAMP
TO OLIVE IT APPEARED THAT JUST THIS PARTNERSHIP OF THEIR TWO MINDS--EACH OF THEM BY ITSELF LACKING AN IMPORTANT GROUP OF FACETS--MADE AN ORGANIC WHOLE WHICH FOR THE WORK IN HAND COULD NOT FAIL TO BE BRILLIANTLY EFFECTIVE
SHE WAS CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO BEHOLD MRS LUNA
IF VERENA FELT SHE WAS GOING TO BE STIMULATED THAT EVENING HE WAS PRETTY SURE THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED
HE WONDERED WHY SHE WAS AGITATED NOT FORESEEING THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO DISCOVER LATER THAT HER NATURE WAS LIKE A SKIFF IN A STORMY SEA
HE HAD A GENERAL IDEA THEY WERE MEDIUMS COMMUNISTS VEGETARIANS
BUT MISS BIRDSEYE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND SAT THERE FOR A GOOD WHILE AS SPEECHLESS AS IF SHE MEANT TO CONVEY THAT SHE HAD BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG NOW TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE PROPRIETY OF THE LATE REBELLION
SHE SAW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISLIKING HIS MOTHER
IT HAD HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG MATTHIAS MORE THAN ONCE TO BE SHOWN THE WAY TO THE DOOR BUT THE PATH OF RETREAT HAD NEVER YET SEEMED TO HIM SO UNPLEASANT
IT HAD BEEN WHEN SHE WAS UPSTAIRS WITH ADELINE AS HIS CARD WAS BROUGHT UP A SUDDEN AND VERY ABNORMAL INSPIRATION TO OFFER HIM THIS FOR HER REALLY ULTIMATE FAVOUR
BUT EVIDENTLY THEY WOULDN'T AND HER BEST SAFETY WAS IN SEEING AS MANY AS SHOULD TURN UP
HE HAD TRIED FOR A WHILE TO CARRY ON THE PLANTATION HIMSELF BUT HE HAD A MILLSTONE OF DEBT ROUND HIS NECK AND HE LONGED FOR SOME WORK WHICH WOULD TRANSPORT HIM TO THE HAUNTS OF MEN
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE STRUCK HIM AS MAKING UNWOMANLY OVERTURES MISS CHANCELLOR HATED THIS EPITHET ALMOST AS MUCH AS SHE HATED ITS OPPOSITE
SHE FIDGETED WAS RESTLESS WHILE SHE TALKED AND HAD THE AIR OF A PERSON WHO WHATEVER SHE MIGHT BE DOING WOULD WISH TO BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN VAGUELY SINKING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED
HE WAS RECALLED TO THIS FACT BY THE ENTRANCE OF MRS LUNA ARRAYED AS IF FOR THE STREET AND PUTTING ON HER GLOVES AGAIN--SHE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE PUTTING ON HER GLOVES
AND SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE CONSIDERED THE TARRANTS AS A TYPE A DEPLORABLE ONE A CLASS THAT WITH THE PUBLIC AT LARGE DISCREDITED THE CAUSE OF THE NEW TRUTHS
BUT THE GIRL WAS BEING SAVED WITHOUT INTERFERENCE BY THE SIMPLE OPERATION OF HER INTEREST IN THOSE VERY DESIGNS
VERENA INCLINED TO THINK HE WAS TO BE RESPECTED
IN ALL MRS LUNA'S VISIONS OF HERSELF HER DISCRETION WAS THE LEADING FEATURE
WHATEVER IT WAS IT HAD PRODUCED A REACTION SO THAT HE FELT RATHER ASHAMED OF HAVING FOUND HIS LOOK-OUT OF LATE SO BLANK
SHE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM ANY THE BETTER FOR THAT
SHE WAS QUEER INDEED--A FLACCID RELAXED UNHEALTHY WHIMSICAL WOMAN WHO STILL HAD A CAPACITY TO CLING
VERENA WAS OFTEN FAR MORE IRRESPONSIVE THAN SHE LIKED TO SEE HER
WHATEVER IS IS WRONG AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
THESE THINGS ADDED TO HER VALUE FOR OLIVE
PROMISE SHE REPEATED
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW BY EXPERIENCE
BUT APPARENTLY MISS OLIVE HAD NOT MENTIONED HER NEW FRIEND
BUT HADN'T IT THROWN A KIND OF RAINBOW OVER HER CRADLE AND WOULDN'T SHE NATURALLY HAVE SOME GIFT
IF HE HAD GONE A LITTLE FURTHER STILL HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNISED THE HOUSE AS ONE OF THOSE IN WHICH MYSTERIOUS ARTICLES OF CLOTHING ARE ALWAYS HOOKED TO SOMETHING IN THE HALL
WHAT BASIL RANSOM ACTUALLY PERCEIVED WAS THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WAS A SIGNAL OLD MAID
EVEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER GIFT HAD NOT MADE HER THINK HERSELF TOO PRECIOUS FOR MERE EXPERIMENTS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THIS CHARMING BLOOMING SIMPLE CREATURE ALL YOUTH AND GRACE AND INNOCENCE GOT HER EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF REFLEXION
SHE JUST QUIVERS WHEN SHE DESCRIBES WHAT OUR SEX HAS BEEN THROUGH
AND THIS RETICENCE STRUCK HIM AS UNEXPECTEDLY DELICATE AND DISCREET
OF COURSE I AM ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO DO SO
HE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING BUT A PIECE OF PIE WHEN HE CAME IN
I AM AFRAID YOU'LL FEEL THAT YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND US YET MATTHIAS PARDON REMAINED
IT WAS FAMILIAR TO HER THAT THE COLLECTIVE HEART OF HER SEX HAD GONE FORTH TO HER
THAT WAS RATHER AWFUL EVEN IF IT REPRESENTED THE FATE ONE WOULD LIKE
TARRANT'S TALK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER HER PROSPECTS HER ENTHUSIASM WAS TERRIBLY PAINFUL TO OLIVE
TARRANT CREAKED ALONG IN PURSUIT TO ASSIST MISS CHANCELLOR
SHE WOULD EXPECT HIM TO BE STRENUOUS IN RETURN
I KNOW ABOUT YOU MISS CHANCELLOR
IF THE OPPORTUNITY WERE NOT DENIED ME HERE I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF BASIL RANSOM'S INTERIOR OF CERTAIN CURIOUS PERSONS OF BOTH SEXES FOR THE MOST PART NOT FAVOURITES OF FORTUNE WHO HAD FOUND AN OBSCURE ASYLUM THERE
SHE WAS SO AGITATED THAT EVIDENTLY SHE COULD NOT TRUST HERSELF AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR RANSOM BUT TO FOLLOW
BUT THIS WAS WHERE THE GIRLS WERE OF THE ROMPING SORT
BEING EVER AS WILLING TO LET WOMEN OFF EASILY IN THE PARTICULAR CASE AS HE WAS FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE SEX IN GENERAL REQUIRES WATCHING
THERE WAS SOMETHING INEXORABLE IN THE POVERTY OF THE SCENE SHAMEFUL IN THE MEANNESS OF ITS DETAILS WHICH GAVE A COLLECTIVE IMPRESSION OF BOARDS AND TIN AND FROZEN EARTH SHEDS AND ROTTING PILES RAILWAY-LINES STRIDING FLAT ACROSS A THOROUGHFARE OF PUDDLES AND TRACKS OF THE HUMBLER THE UNIVERSAL HORSE-CAR TRAVERSING OBLIQUELY THIS PATH OF DANGER
I HAVE INTIMATED THAT OUR YOUNG FRIENDS HAD A SOURCE OF FORTIFYING EMOTION WHICH WAS DISTINCT FROM THE HOURS THEY SPENT WITH BEETHOVEN AND BACH OR IN HEARING MISS BIRDSEYE DESCRIBE CONCORD AS IT USED TO BE
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT ONCE WHEN SHE BETRAYED HER SUSPICION SELAH REMARKED THAT THE ONLY REFRESHMENT HE EVER WANTED WAS THE SENSE THAT HE WAS DOING SOME GOOD
I HAVE NO SELF-POSSESSION NO ELOQUENCE
BUT I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT MISS OLIVE WHY IN THE WORLD
OLIVE POURED FORTH THESE VIEWS TO HER LISTENING AND RESPONSIVE FRIEND
HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS AND HE HAD A CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL PROVINCIAL RESPECT FOR WOMEN WHICH EVEN PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTEMPTING TO GIVE A NAME TO IT IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
HE WAS MUCH AT HIS EASE PLAINLY BENEATH THE ROOF OF THE TARRANTS AND OLIVE REFLECTED THAT THOUGH VERENA HAD TOLD HER MUCH ABOUT HIM SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER THE IDEA THAT HE WAS AS INTIMATE AS THAT
HE WAS INSUFFERABLY FORWARD AND SELFISH
YES I AM HARD
THOSE SEEMED TO BE THE ONES YOU WERE PRINCIPALLY AFRAID OF YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO MARRY ANY ONE YOU DON'T LIKE SAID OLIVE
MOTHER TOLD ME I HAD BETTER COME RIGHT IN SAID VERENA LOOKING NOW ABOUT THE ROOM VERY GLAD TO FIND HERSELF IN SO PLEASANT A PLACE AND NOTICING A GREAT MANY THINGS THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IN DETAIL
WHAT ADELINE CARED FOR WAS THE FALLEN ARISTOCRACY IT SEEMED TO BE FALLING EVERYWHERE VERY MUCH
HE HAD COME WITH A PROPOSAL OF HIS OWN AND HE HOPED IT WOULD SEEM A SUFFICIENT WARRANT FOR HIS VISIT
BUT I DON'T LIKE THOSE I SEE
SUCH A QUESTION BROUGHT HER BACK HOWEVER TO HER PERPETUAL ENIGMA THE MYSTERY SHE HAD ALREADY TURNED OVER IN HER MIND FOR HOURS TOGETHER--THE WONDER OF SUCH PEOPLE BEING VERENA'S PROGENITORS AT ALL
THEY BROKE INTO EXCLAMATIONS AND MURMURS
BUT IT WAS NOTHING NEW FOR HER TO HAVE TO PRACTISE PATIENCE AND SHE COULD FEEL AT LEAST THAT IT WAS JUST AS HANDY FOR MR BURRAGE TO CALL ON THE CHILD IN TOWN WHERE HE SPENT HALF HIS TIME SLEEPING CONSTANTLY AT PARKER'S
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN
FOR HE HAD GROWN VERY CURIOUS AND HE WAS AFRAID THAT NOW AT THE LAST MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD PREVENT HIS ENTERING THE HOUSE
HOW SHOULD I BE
BUT HER HOUSE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THOROUGHLY WELL REGULATED SHE WAS PASSIONATELY CLEAN AND SHE WAS AN EXCELLENT WOMAN OF BUSINESS
THE ADDED LUXURIES IN THE LITTLE HOUSE AT CAMBRIDGE WHICH EVEN WITH THEIR HELP WAS STILL SUCH A PENAL SETTLEMENT MADE HER FEEL AFRESH THAT BEFORE SHE CAME TO THE RESCUE THE DAUGHTER OF THAT HOUSE HAD TRAVERSED A DESERT OF SORDID MISERY
WE SHOULD QUENCH IT WE SHOULD MAKE IT STILL AND THE SOUND OF OUR LIPS WOULD BECOME THE VOICE OF UNIVERSAL PEACE
XII VERENA RECOGNISED HIM
YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT WELL THAT MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD BE ALL THAT YOU SAY
SHE LECTURED ON TEMPERANCE AND THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN
THERE WERE PINK FLUSHES ON SNOW TENDER REFLEXIONS IN PATCHES OF STIFFENED MARSH SOUNDS OF CAR-BELLS NO LONGER VULGAR BUT ALMOST SILVERY ON THE LONG BRIDGE LONELY OUTLINES OF DISTANT DUSKY UNDULATIONS AGAINST THE FADING GLOW
HE INSISTED ON THAT WORD
HAS YOUR SISTER YES
THE POOR WOMAN MATRIMONIALLY HAD A GREAT DEAL TO PUT UP WITH
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING MISS BIRDSEYE LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN
MR PARDON WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE SHE KNEW
SHE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF SO MANY DIFFERENCES OF SOCIAL COMPLEXION
BUT MISS CHANCELLOR MADE HIM FEEL THAT SHE WAS IN EARNEST AND THAT IDEA FRIGHTENED THE RESISTANCE OUT OF HIM--IT HAD SUCH TERRIBLE ASSOCIATIONS
THIS WAS AN UNCONSCIOUS INVOLUNTARY EXPRESSION OF RELIEF SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT UTTER WHO HAD SEEN HIMSELF ON THE POINT OF BEING RUN OVER AND YET FELT THAT HE WAS WHOLE
I WILL PROMISE AT ANY RATE NOT TO MARRY ANY OF THOSE GENTLEMEN THAT WERE AT THE HOUSE SHE SAID
IT CAME BACK TO MISS BIRDSEYE IN THIS CONNEXION THAT SURE ENOUGH VERENA HAD BEEN AWAY FOR A LONG TIME--FOR NEARLY A YEAR
IN SPITE OF OLIVE'S DESIRE TO KEEP HER PRECIOUS INMATE TO HERSELF AND TO BEND HER ATTENTION UPON THEIR COMMON STUDIES IN SPITE OF HER CONSTANTLY REMINDING VERENA THAT THIS WINTER WAS TO BE PURELY EDUCATIVE AND THAT THE PLATITUDES OF THE SATISFIED AND UNREGENERATE WOULD HAVE LITTLE TO TEACH HER IN SPITE IN SHORT OF THE SEVERE AND CONSTANT DUALITY OF OUR YOUNG WOMEN IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THEIR LIFE HAD NOT MANY PERSONAL CONFLUENTS AND TRIBUTARIES
SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING TO BRIGHTEN THE DARKNESS OF THAT DREADFUL IMAGE THAT WAS ALWAYS BEFORE HER AND AGAINST WHICH IT SEEMED TO HER AT TIMES THAT SHE HAD BEEN BORN TO LEAD A CRUSADE--THE IMAGE OF THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
LOOK HERE MISS TARRANT
HE EXTENDED INVITATIONS TO HER GUESTS UNDER HER NOSE
HE WAS PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN DRAWING OUT THE LADIES
THEY REMINDED HIM OF STOCKINGS AND HE WONDERED HOW SHE MANAGED WITHOUT GARTERS ABOVE THE ELBOW
SHE HAD RECEIVED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN THERE THE DAY BEFORE WITH THE ADDITION OF A SPICE OF MYSTERIOUS MELANCHOLY
HE DOES PLACE THINGS IN A VERY SEDUCTIVE LIGHT VERENA SAID
WELL IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE GOING TO HELP HER TO DEVELOP HE REMARKED
THIS WAS DONE WITH CHILDLIKE GOOD FAITH
BUT OLIVE COULD NOT TELL VERENA EVERYTHING--COULD NOT TELL HER THAT SHE HATED THAT DREADFUL PAIR AT CAMBRIDGE
THAT'S THE WAY RUMOURS FLY ROUND IN THAT SET I PRESUME
HE WAS TOO SIMPLE--TOO MISSISSIPPIAN--FOR THAT
IT HAD PREVENTED BASIL RANSOM AT ANY RATE FROM PUTTING THE DOTS ON HIS I_'S AS THE FRENCH SAY IN THIS GRADUAL DISCOVERY THAT MRS LUNA WAS MAKING LOVE TO HIM
SHE WAS CAPABLE OF THINKING THAT HE TALKED TOO MUCH--SHE HERSELF HAVING APPARENTLY NO GENERAL CONVERSATION
RANSOM SIMPLY LOATHED HIM FROM THE MOMENT HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING AND SHE SUFFERED THE YOUNG MAN TO LEAD HER TO THE CAR WHICH HAD NOW STOPPED AT THEIR CORNER
IT TOOK A DOUBLE CONSENT TO MAKE A FRIENDSHIP BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THIS INTENSELY SYMPATHETIC GIRL WOULD REFUSE
THIS GUEST AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION BETWEEN THAT LADY AND VERENA WAS SELECTED AND THE FIRST PERSON OLIVE SAW ON ENTERING THE LITTLE PARLOUR IN CAMBRIDGE WAS A YOUNG MAN WITH HAIR PREMATURELY OR AS ONE FELT THAT ONE SHOULD SAY PRECOCIOUSLY WHITE WHOM SHE HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION SHE HAD ENCOUNTERED BEFORE AND WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO HER AS MR MATTHIAS PARDON
HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT HE CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE THEORY AND SO HIS VISITORS MUST HAVE THOUGHT WHEN THEY FOUND HIM WITH ONE OF HIS LONG LEGS TWISTED ROUND THE OTHER READING A VOLUME OF DE TOCQUEVILLE
I GUESS YOU HAD BETTER COME ROUND SOME OTHER NIGHT SELAH SUGGESTED PACIFICALLY BUT WITH A SIGNIFICANCE WHICH FELL UPON OLIVE'S EAR
FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR
SHE'S HAVING A PRIVATE LECTURE TO HERSELF RANSOM REMARKED
IF YOU COULD SEE THEM--I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE SOMETHING MONSTROUS GIVE THEM A REGULAR DUCKING AND MAKE THEM GASP MATTHIAS PARDON CRIED
SHE WAS ONLY AGREEABLY WARMED
THE EFFECT OF IT WAS TO MAKE HIM RISE TO HIS FEET
SUCH A DORMITORY WHEN IT IS SO EXIGUOUS IS CALLED IN THE NOMENCLATURE OF NEW YORK A HALL BEDROOM THE SITTING-ROOM BESIDE IT WAS SLIGHTLY LARGER AND THEY BOTH COMMANDED A ROW OF TENEMENTS NO LESS DEGENERATE THAN RANSOM'S OWN HABITATION--HOUSES BUILT FORTY YEARS BEFORE AND ALREADY SERE AND SUPERANNUATED
AND WHY SHOULD SHE HOLD HERSELF SUPERIOR TO THESE
DOES SHE GIVE PUBLIC ADDRESSES OH YES SHE HAS HAD QUITE A CAREER IN THE WEST
SHE EXCLAIMED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT THE BATTLE WITHOUT HUMAN HELP BUT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER SO
IT WAS AGREEABLE TO HER THAT THIS IMPERIAL WOMAN SHOULD BE AWAY
HE WAS AWARE HOW MUCH HE WAS AN OUTSIDER IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THAT AND HE WAS READY TO WAIT FOR HIS COVETED SATISFACTION TILL THE OTHERS WHO ALL HUNG TOGETHER SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HER THE ASSURANCE OF AN APPROVAL WHICH SHE WOULD VALUE NATURALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING HE COULD SAY TO HER
BUT IT WAS IN SUCH A GOOD CAUSE RANSOM MEANT THIS ALLUSION TO THE GREAT SECESSION AND BY COMPARISON TO THE ATTITUDE OF THE RESISTING MALE LAUDABLE EVEN AS THAT MIGHT BE TO BE DECENTLY JOCULAR
IT WAS ONLY THE FEAR OF SEEMING PATRONISING TO PEOPLE IN MISFORTUNE THAT HAD PREVENTED HER FROM WRITING TO MISSISSIPPI
SHE ENDEAVOURED TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION IN A CHANNEL WHICH WOULD ENABLE HER TO ASK SUDDEN INCOHERENT QUESTIONS OF OLIVE MAINLY AS TO WHETHER SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL LADIES THE EXPRESSION WAS MRS TARRANT'S NOT ONLY IN BOSTON BUT IN THE OTHER CITIES WHICH IN HER NOMADIC COURSE SHE HERSELF HAD VISITED
VERENA ANSWERED SOMEWHAT IMPETUOUSLY THAT SHE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO VISIT MRS BURRAGE
IT'S AS IF THE CHORDS WERE STRUNG ACROSS HER OWN HEART
AND IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE TO HIM THOUGH HE HAD JUST SEEN THE LITTLE PROPHETESS KISS HER THAT SHE SHOULD EVER BECOME ANY ONE'S DEAR LEAST OF ALL WAS SHE A THING
THIS WAS THE LAST INQUIRY OLIVE ALLOWED HIM THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING
HIS HOSTESS SAT SILENT A MOMENT WITH HER EYES ON THE GROUND
IN REALITY HE HAD ONE ALL-ABSORBING SOLICITUDE--THE DESIRE TO GET PARAGRAPHS PUT INTO THE NEWSPAPERS PARAGRAPHS OF WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE SUBJECT BUT OF WHICH HE WAS NOW TO DIVIDE THE GLORY WITH HIS DAUGHTER
AND AS THE SILENCE CONTINUED HE ALMOST FELL TO MUSING ON HIS DUTY ALMOST PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT THE MORAL LAW COMMANDED HIM TO MARRY MRS LUNA
SHE DOES MOTHER REALLY
SHE HAD HAD OCCASION TO WISH MORE THAN ONCE THAT HE WOULDN'T BE SO BEASTLY POLITE AS SHE USED TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY IN ENGLAND
I MACMILLAN AND CO LIMITED ST
THERE HAD BEEN SOME NEW YORK LADIES PRESENT WHO WERE ON AT THAT MOMENT AND WITH WHOM HER INTERCOURSE WAS RICH IN EMOTIONS
APPARENTLY SHE CONFOUNDED HIM WITH SOME ONE ELSE THAT WAS VERY POSSIBLE
SHE THOUGHT HIM VERY HANDSOME AS HE SAID THIS BUT REFLECTED THAT UNFORTUNATELY MEN DIDN'T CARE FOR THE TRUTH ESPECIALLY THE NEW KINDS IN PROPORTION AS THEY WERE GOOD-LOOKING
AND YET PEOPLE SAID THAT WOMEN WERE VAIN THAT THEY WERE PERSONAL THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED
HE SHOULDN'T CARE SO MUCH HOW SHE GOT THERE BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY ADD TO HIS PLEASURE IF HE COULD SHOW HER UP TO HER PLACE
HE WAS VERY FASHIONABLE HE WENT OUT A GREAT DEAL IN BOSTON I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PLACES SAID MRS TARRANT
HE TALKED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SOUTH ITS SOCIAL PECULIARITIES THE RUIN WROUGHT BY THE WAR THE DILAPIDATED GENTRY THE QUEER TYPES OF SUPERANNUATED FIRE-EATERS RAGGED AND UNRECONCILED ALL THE PATHOS AND ALL THE COMEDY OF IT MAKING HER LAUGH AT ONE MOMENT ALMOST CRY AT ANOTHER AND SAY TO HERSELF THROUGHOUT THAT WHEN HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD MAKE A LADY'S EVENING PASS SO PLEASANTLY
THE ONLY TROUBLE WAS THAT HER SPEAKING FOR NOTHING WAS NOT THE WAY TO REMIND HIM THAT HE HAD A REMUNERATIVE DAUGHTER
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO DO THAT ALWAYS--JUST TO TAKE MEN AS THEY ARE AND NOT TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEIR BADNESS
TO HER TOO MUSIC WAS A DELIGHT AND HER LISTENING FACE TURNED ITSELF TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM UNCONSCIOUSLY WHILE HER EYES VAGUELY RESTED ON THE BIBELOTS THAT EMERGED INTO THE FIRELIGHT
SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK-A-DAY ASPECT
THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMIABLE FLATNESS IN HIS TONE AND HE ABOUNDED IN EXCLAMATIONS--"GOODNESS GRACIOUS AND MERCY ON US!"--NOT MUCH IN USE AMONG THE SEX WHOSE PROFANITY IS APT TO BE COARSE
SHE WORE A FLOWING MANTLE WHICH RESEMBLED HER HUSBAND'S WATERPROOF--A GARMENT WHICH WHEN SHE TURNED TO HER DAUGHTER OR TALKED ABOUT HER MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR THE ROBE OF A SORT OF PRIESTESS OF MATERNITY
THERE WAS A LITHOGRAPHIC SMOOTHNESS ABOUT HER AND A MIXTURE OF THE AMERICAN MATRON AND THE PUBLIC CHARACTER
THE LOGIC OF HER CONDUCT WAS NONE OF THE CLEAREST
SHE LOOKED UP AT MRS FARRINDER WITH ALL HER EMOTION IN HER SMILING EYES
IT COST MISS CHANCELLOR AN EFFORT TO ADMIT THAT ANY VIRTUE STILL LINGERED IN THE ELDER WORLD AND THAT IT COULD HAVE ANY IMPORTANT LESSON FOR TWO SUCH GOOD AMERICANS AS HER FRIEND AND HERSELF
I'M SURE THE YOUNG LADY WOULD HAVE HAD EQUAL SUCCESS AT CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS BASIL RANSOM INTERPOSED
COULDN'T THEY RUN MISS VERENA TOGETHER
IT DIDN'T SEEM AS IF IT COULD TAKE ANY OTHER
HER MOTHER HAD WISHED TO TAKE IT UP
BUT PROMISE AND OLIVE DREW THE GIRL NEARER TO HER FLINGING OVER HER WITH ONE HAND THE FOLD OF A CLOAK THAT HUNG AMPLE UPON HER OWN MEAGRE PERSON AND HOLDING HER THERE WITH THE OTHER WHILE SHE LOOKED AT HER SUPPLIANT BUT HALF HESITATING
VERENA SAID SHE DID THINK SHE HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMAGINATION
HE EXPECTED HIS REVENGE FOR THIS THE DAY AFTER VERENA SHOULD HAVE BURST FORTH
THEY DON'T WANT SO MUCH AS THAT WELL THEN GO IN AND SPEAK FOR THEM--AND SING FOR THEM--AND DANCE FOR THEM OLIVE YOU ARE CRUEL YES I AM
BUT SHE WASN'T IN HER ROOM AND MISS BIRDSEYE GUESSED SHE HAD GONE OUT TO HER SUPPER
AND BASIL RANSOM WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHETHER IF SHE WERE TO ASK HIM POINT-BLANK TO MARRY HER IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGH COURTESY OF A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN TO REFUSE
AND THEN VERENA SMILED BACK WHILE HER EXPRESSION SEEMED TO SAY THAT OH YES SHE WAS GIVING UP EVERYTHING ALL PRINCIPLES ALL PROJECTS
A PALE REFLEXION OF IT WILL SERVE
THE GIRL WAS BOTH SUBMISSIVE AND UNWORLDLY AND SHE LISTENED TO HER MOTHER'S ENUMERATION OF THE POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES OF AN INTIMACY WITH MISS CHANCELLOR AS SHE WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ANY OTHER FAIRY-TALE
SHE SUPPOSED SHE COULDN'T BE SO EFFECTIVE ON THE PLATFORM IF SHE HADN'T A RICH FANCY
I NEVER SAW ANY ONE THAT TOOK SO LITTLE REST
YOU WILL HEAR SOME DISCUSSION IF YOU ARE FOND OF THAT
IT LIFTED ONE UP TO BE WITH HER
WELL I MUST SAY SAID MISS TARRANT I PREFER FREE UNIONS OLIVE HELD HER BREATH AN INSTANT
FOR OLIVE IT MADE HER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
SHE SAW THAT HE MIGHT BE BORED
MRS TARRANT MEANWHILE IN THE PARLOUR REMARKED THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULDN'T TRUST VERENA WITH HER OWN PARENTS
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE WORLD IS OURS TOO OURS--LITTLE AS WE HAVE EVER HAD TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING!--AND THAT THE QUESTION IS NOT YET DEFINITELY SETTLED WHETHER IT SHALL BE A PLACE OF INJUSTICE OR A PLACE OF LOVE IT WAS WITH THIS THAT THE YOUNG LADY FINISHED HER HARANGUE WHICH WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY HER SINKING EXHAUSTED INTO HER CHAIR OR BY ANY OF THE TRACES OF A LABOURED CLIMAX
BUT I MUST SAY WHEN A YOUNG MAN LOOKS LIKE THAT I CALL HIM PAINFULLY PLAIN
IT CONSISTED MAINLY OF THE VISION OF PLENTY OF CIGARS AND BRANDY AND WATER AND NEWSPAPERS AND A CANE-BOTTOMED ARM-CHAIR OF THE RIGHT INCLINATION FROM WHICH HE COULD STRETCH HIS LEGS
DO YOU MAKE IT A REPROACH TO ME THAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE MONEY
ADELINE SUBSEQUENTLY WROTE THAT SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO PUT HER AFFAIRS INTO HIS HANDS OLIVE SIGHED NOT UNMAGNANIMOUSLY AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER SISTER'S AFFAIRS AND LATER STILL SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE WAS THINKING STRONGLY OF TAKING HIM TO BE NEWTON'S TUTOR
HE HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE ENGAGED TO MISS WINKWORTH
MRS LUNA LET HER KNOW VERY SOON THAT THESE INTERVIEWS HAD BEGUN
SHE SAYS I OUGHT TO HAVE A WIDE INFLUENCE IF I CAN OBTAIN THE EAR OF THE PUBLIC
MRS LUNA WROTE AS IF HE WERE PREPARED TO GIVE UP HIS PROFESSION TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER SON AND OLIVE WAS PRETTY SURE THAT THIS WAS ONLY A PART OF HER GRANDEUR OF THE HABIT SHE HAD CONTRACTED ESPECIALLY SINCE LIVING IN EUROPE OF SPEAKING AS IF IN EVERY CASE SHE REQUIRED SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS
IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT GREAT BEAUTIES GREAT GENIUSES GREAT CHARACTERS TAKE THEIR OWN TIMES AND PLACES FOR COMING INTO THE WORLD LEAVING THE GAPING SPECTATORS TO MAKE THEM FIT IN AND HOLDING FROM FAR-OFF ANCESTORS OR EVEN PERHAPS STRAIGHT FROM THE DIVINE GENEROSITY MUCH MORE THAN FROM THEIR UGLY OR STUPID PROGENITORS
BY THE WAY I HOPE SHE IS WELL MISS BIRDSEYE STARED AGAIN
FOR THE MOMENT IT REMAINED QUITE IN ABEYANCE
I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF RANSOM'S ILL-STARRED VIEWS BEING CONVINCED THAT THE READER WILL GUESS THEM AS HE GOES FOR THEY HAD A FROLICSOME INGENIOUS WAY OF PEEPING OUT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S CONVERSATION
HE ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE YOU JUMP
AND SHE ALSO REFLECTED ON SOMETHING THAT MADE AN ANSWER SEEM MORE DIFFICULT--THE FACT THAT THE GIRL HAD GROWN UP AMONG LADY-DOCTORS LADY-MEDIUMS LADY-EDITORS LADY-PREACHERS LADY-HEALERS WOMEN WHO HAVING RESCUED THEMSELVES FROM A PASSIVE EXISTENCE COULD ILLUSTRATE ONLY PARTIALLY THE MISERY OF THE SEX AT LARGE
I HAVE TOLD HIM YOU ARE A RADICAL AND YOU MAY TELL HIM IF YOU LIKE THAT I AM A PAINTED JEZEBEL
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER MANNER TO INDICATE THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF VERENA ON HER SON'S ACCOUNT
HE HAD NOTICED IT OFTEN BEFORE
HE SUPPOSED SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT--HE KNEW SHE WAS SO INTERESTED IN WOMAN'S HAVING A FREE FIELD
SHE LEADS A LOVELY LIFE SAID MISS BIRDSEYE
IV SHE HAD TOLD HIM BEFORE THEY STARTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE EARLY
HE FELT IN A WORD NOT AT LIBERTY TO RING AT HER DOOR
HER WHITE HANDS MOVED WITH LITTLE JERKS AS SHE TOOK HER STITCHES AND HER RINGS FLASHED AND TWINKLED IN THE LIGHT OF THE HEARTH
THERE WAS SOMETHING PUBLIC IN HER EYE WHICH WAS LARGE COLD AND QUIET
OLIVE WAS MUCH MORE REMARKABLE THAN MRS TARRANT SUSPECTED REMARKABLE AS MRS TARRANT BELIEVED HER TO BE
OLIVE HAD TIME IN THE COURSE OF THIS APPEAL TO MAKE HER FACULTIES CONVERGE TO ASK HERSELF WHAT SHE COULD SAY TO THIS PRODIGIOUS YOUNG MAN THAT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL AS HOW BASE A THING SHE HELD HIS PROPOSAL THAT THEY SHOULD CONSTITUTE THEMSELVES INTO A COMPANY FOR DRAWING PROFIT FROM VERENA
IT WAS A PART OF VERENA'S BEING UNLIKE HER THAT SHE SHOULD FEEL MR PARDON'S PROMISE OF ETERNAL EXCITEMENT TO BE A BRILLIANT THING SHOULD INDEED CONSIDER MR PARDON WITH ANY TOLERANCE AT ALL
WHAT A PITY THE KETTLE HAS CEASED SINGING!"--WHEN SHE UTTERED THESE INSINUATING WORDS HE GAVE HIMSELF A LITTLE IMPERCEPTIBLE SHAKE WHICH WAS HOWEVER ENOUGH TO BREAK THE SPELL AND MADE NO RESPONSE MORE DIRECT THAN TO ASK HER IN A MOMENT IN A TONE OF COLD MILD CURIOSITY WHETHER SHE HAD LATELY HEARD FROM HER SISTER AND HOW LONG MISS CHANCELLOR INTENDED TO REMAIN IN EUROPE
I MENTION IT NOT ON ACCOUNT OF ANY PARTICULAR INFLUENCE IT MAY HAVE HAD ON THE LIFE OR THE THOUGHTS OF BASIL RANSOM BUT FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE AND THAT OF LOCAL COLOUR
IT WAS NOT UNPLEASING THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE AVENGED FOR IT WOULD AVENGE HIM TO KNOW IT UPON THE WANTON YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD INVITED HIM TO COME AND SEE HER IN ORDER SIMPLY TO SLAP HIS FACE
THIS WAS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY PROVIDENCE HAD JUDGED HER WORTHY OF HAVING SO WONDERFUL A CHILD
THEY PRETEND TO ADMIRE US VERY MUCH BUT I SHOULD LIKE THEM TO ADMIRE US A LITTLE LESS AND TO TRUST US A LITTLE MORE
HOW LONG DID YOU EXPECT HER TO ENDURE IT I AM SURE I DON'T KNOW
IF SUCH PERCEPTIONS ARE DELICATE AS BETWEEN MEN THE READER NEED NOT BE REMINDED OF THE EXQUISITE FORM THEY MAY ASSUME IN NATURES MORE REFINED
BUT THERE WAS LITTLE ENOUGH THAT WAS PUBLIC IN HIS SOLITARY STUDIES AND HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WAS THE USE OF HIS HAVING AN OFFICE AT ALL AND WHY HE MIGHT NOT AS WELL CARRY ON HIS PROFESSION AT THE ASTOR LIBRARY WHERE IN HIS SPARE HOURS AND ON CHANCE HOLIDAYS HE DID AN IMMENSE DEAL OF SUGGESTIVE READING
SHE'D RUN FOR TEN YEARS AT LEAST
HER IDEAS OF ENJOYMENT WERE VERY SIMPLE
IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER EAR SAVE WHEN MRS TARRANT AND VERENA CONVERSED IN PROLONGED AND INGENUOUS ASIDES
HE PLAYED A VERY ACTIVE PART IN THE EVENTS I HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN SOME DEGREE TO SET FORTH
I HAVE NEVER YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE WORLD ANY BUT OLD TRUTHS--AS OLD AS THE SUN AND MOON
AND SHE NOW PERCEIVED THAT WHEN SPIRIT MEETS SPIRIT THERE MUST EITHER BE MUTUAL ABSORPTION OR A SHARP CONCUSSION
OLIVE CHANCELLOR CROSSED AND RESUMED HER PLACE BESIDE MRS FARRINDER ON THE SOFA THE GIRL HAD QUITTED
YES
SHE COULD SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MR GRACIE AND MR BURRAGE
THERE'S VERY LITTLE OF THE INDIAN SUMMER ABOUT ME
SHE HAD BEEN INDEBTED FOR THIS SERVICE TO A GENTLEMAN-FRIEND WHO WROTE HER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON AND WHAT EVERY ONE HAD EVERY DAY FOR DINNER
SUCH AN IDEA WAS SO DISAGREEABLE TO HER
SHE HAD NO WORLDLY PRIDE NO TRADITIONS OF INDEPENDENCE NO IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DONE AND WHAT WAS NOT DONE
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT THE INTEREST IN SINGING IS SO GENERAL SAID MISS BIRDSEYE QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY SLACKNESS IN PREPARING A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT HAD FAILED HER
THERE WERE EVEN DAYS SHE HAD SO MANY DISCOURAGEMENTS WHEN IT SEEMED AS IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW
IF HE HAD PUT ON THE SCREW OF LATE IT WAS AFTER REFLEXION AND BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES PRESSED HIM CLOSE
SHE HAD A RUSTLING DRESS IT WAS EVIDENT WHAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT TASTE ABUNDANT HAIR OF A GLOSSY BLACKNESS A PAIR OF FOLDED ARMS THE EXPRESSION OF WHICH SEEMED TO SAY THAT REST IN SUCH A CAREER AS HERS WAS AS SWEET AS IT WAS BRIEF AND A TERRIBLE REGULARITY OF FEATURE
IF IT SHOULD EXIST IN DUPLICATE FOR VERENA THE GIRL WOULD BE FAVOURED INDEED
BUT HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF QUICKLY ENOUGH TO SAY WITH GENUINE EXPRESSION I REGARD YOU AS THE DEAREST THING IN LIFE THE ONLY THING WHICH MAKES IT WORTH LIVING WORTH LIVING FOR--YOU
WHEN SHE WAS CALM SHE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS BUT WHEN SHE WAS AGITATED SHE WAS GUILTY OF LAPSES EVERY ONE OF WHICH CAME BACK TO HER MAGNIFIED IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
SHE WAS ROUSING THE PEOPLE FROM MAINE TO TEXAS
THE ATTRACTION MIGHT HAVE VANISHED AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT THE MENTAL PICTURE OF IT WAS YET VIVID
HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD YOU AT ANY PARTICULAR MOMENT WHAT HE WAS DOING
WHICH WAS NATURAL ENOUGH INASMUCH AS TO HER VISION ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WAS USUAL WAS INIQUITOUS
SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE
SHE HAD A SAD SOFT PALE FACE WHICH AND IT WAS THE EFFECT OF HER WHOLE HEAD LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN SOAKED BLURRED AND MADE VAGUE BY EXPOSURE TO SOME SLOW DISSOLVENT
I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS AUDIENCES THAT ARE WORTH ADDRESSING--TO CONVINCE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIOUS AND SINCERE OLIVE HERSELF AS SHE SPOKE HEARD THE GREAT SHAKE IN HER VOICE
AND RANSOM HEARD HIM ADD IN A LOWER TONE
THIS LADY FASCINATED HER CARRIED OFF HER IMAGINATION TO STRANGE LANDS
MRS LUNA HAD HAD AN INSPIRATION
PRODUCED BY R
HE HELPED HER INTO THE CAR THE CONDUCTOR PRESSED A FRATERNAL HAND UPON HER BACK AND IN A MOMENT THE YOUNG MAN WAS SEATED BESIDE HER AND THE JINGLING HAD RECOMMENCED
SHE GREW WHITE UNDER THEM NOT SHEDDING MANY TEARS AS A GENERAL THING LIKE INFERIOR WOMEN SHE CRIED WHEN SHE WAS ANGRY NOT WHEN SHE WAS HURT BUT LIMPING AND PANTING MORALLY AS IF SHE HAD RECEIVED A WOUND THAT SHE WOULD CARRY FOR LIFE
FRIVOLOUS WORLDLY BEACON STREET
SHE HERSELF AT ONE SEASON HAD SPENT A MONTH IN A GEORGIAN JAIL
BUT HE ADDED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HIGH TIME WITH MISS CHANCELLOR FIRST AND THIS WAS EVIDENTLY THE CONVICTION OF THE COMPANY
VERENA REFERRED THE MATTER AS USUAL WITH HER AIR OF BRIGHT UNGRUDGING DEFERENCE TO HER COMPANION
HER FATHER AND MOTHER EXPRESSING THEIR PERFECT CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD EXCUSE THEM WENT TO BED AND LEFT HIM SITTING THERE
AND HOWEVER MUCH SHE MIGHT HAVE SINNED OR HE MIGHT HAVE ALTERED SHE WAS AT LEAST ALWAYS HIS AFFECTIONATE COUSIN ADELINE
SHE LEARNED ALMOST WITH A SENSE OF INJURY THAT NEITHER THE MOTHER NOR THE SON HAD BEEN LONGER BEYOND THE SEAS THAN SHE HERSELF
HE WAS MORE GLAD TO SEE HER THAN IF SHE HAD BEEN AN OLD FRIEND FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME A NEW ONE
HE HAD NO IDEA OF NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES
AND SELAH INTIMATED THAT WITH A PROPER INVITATION HIS DAUGHTER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO ADDRESS HARVARD COLLEGE AT LARGE
BENEATH IT ON THE DISLOCATED FLAGS BARRELS AND BASKETS WERE FREELY AND PICTURESQUELY GROUPED
MISS CHANCELLOR MADE HER REFLEXIONS ON ALL THIS AND THE FIRST OF THEM WAS THAT IT WAS HAPPY FOR HER THAT SHE HAD DETERMINED FOR THE PRESENT TO ACCEPT THESE ACCIDENTS FOR OTHERWISE MIGHT SHE NOT NOW HAVE HAD A DEEPER ALARM
HE WAS NATURALLY AMIABLE BUT IT HAD NOT HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIM TO BE MADE TO FEEL THAT HE WAS NOT--AND COULD NOT BE--A FACTOR IN CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
SHE CONSIDERED MEN IN GENERAL AS SO MUCH IN THE DEBT OF THE OPPOSITE SEX THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL WOMAN HAD AN UNLIMITED CREDIT WITH THEM
OLIVE AFTER THE LAPSE OF WEEKS STILL SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF PRESENTING HERSELF AND MRS TARRANT REBUKED VERENA WITH SOME STERNNESS FOR NOT HAVING MADE HER FEEL THAT THIS ATTENTION WAS DUE TO THE MOTHER OF HER FRIEND
MRS LUNA GLANCED AT HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND GAVE A LITTLE SMILING SIGH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A LONG SUM IN ADDITION
IT WAS ONLY AFTER MUCH EXPERIENCE HE MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT FEW NORTHERNERS WERE IN THEIR SECRET SOUL SO ENERGETIC AS HE
ARE WE NOT TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HEARING YOU IN NEW YORK
EXHILARATION IF IT EVER VISITED HER WAS DUMB
SHE LAUGHED AND CONTINUED TO BLUSH--HER BLUSH WAS THE FAINTEST PINK
THAT WAS THE TRUTH AND SHE WANTED TO SAY IT BECAUSE QUICKLY WITHOUT FORMS OR CIRCUMLOCUTIONS IT MADE THEM FAMILIAR
OLIVE COULD SEE THAT SHE PRODUCED HERSELF QUITE AS WELL AS ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN HAD FORETOLD THE OTHER THAT SHE WOULD
DOCTOR PRANCE HAD COME BACK FROM SUPPER AND MADE HER APPEARANCE IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION THAT MISS BIRDSEYE'S RELAXED VOICE HAD TINKLED DOWN TO HER FROM THE HALL OVER THE BANISTERS WITH MUCH REPETITION TO SECURE ATTENTION
THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE QUESTION OF HER WRITING A LETTER TO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE THE EFFECT OF WHICH SHOULD BE TO LAUNCH MISS TARRANT INTO RENOWN
AND RECEIPTS WERE WHAT SELAH TARRANT WAS IN HIS OWN PARLANCE AFTER
BUT I'M AFRAID THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE
I HAVE FRIENDS IN ST LOUIS YOU OUGHTN'T TO WANT FOR THEM ANYWHERE SAID MRS FARRINDER IN A MANNER WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD QUITE EXPLAINED HER REPUTATION
FOR THINKING THE FACT THAT HE HAD REMAINED POOR A PROOF OF DELICACY IN THAT SHOPKEEPING AGE IT GAVE HER MUCH PLEASURE TO REFLECT THAT AS NEWTON'S LITTLE PROPERTY WAS SETTLED ON HIM WITH SAFEGUARDS WHICH SHOWED HOW LONG-HEADED POOR MR LUNA HAD BEEN AND LARGE-HEARTED TOO SINCE TO WHAT HE LEFT HER NO DISAGREEABLE CONDITIONS SUCH AS ETERNAL MOURNING FOR INSTANCE WERE ATTACHED)--THAT AS NEWTON I SAY ENJOYED THE PECUNIARY INDEPENDENCE WHICH BEFITTED HIS CHARACTER HER OWN INCOME WAS AMPLE EVEN FOR TWO AND SHE MIGHT GIVE HERSELF THE LUXURY OF TAKING A HUSBAND WHO SHOULD OWE HER SOMETHING
WE MUST WAIT
BUT SHE HAD BEEN TOLD VERY LITTLE ELSE ABOUT BEHAVIOUR
RANSOM REFLECTED HE MIGHT ANSWER HER THAT UNTIL FIVE MINUTES AGO HE DIDN'T KNOW SHE EXISTED
QUIETLY--QUIETLY HE MURMURED FROM TIME TO TIME
THEY HAD BEEN DELIVERED ONLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE CAUSE
MRS TARRANT FOUND MISS CHANCELLOR AT HOME BUT SHE WAS NOT GRATIFIED BY EVEN THE MOST TRANSIENT GLIMPSE OF MRS LUNA
I SHALL DO THEM SUFFICIENT JUSTICE IN SAYING THAT HE WAS BY NATURAL DISPOSITION A GOOD DEAL OF A STOIC AND THAT AS THE RESULT OF A CONSIDERABLE INTELLECTUAL EXPERIENCE HE WAS IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MATTERS A REACTIONARY
OLIVE KNEW NOW VERY DEFINITELY WHAT THE PROMISE WAS THAT SHE WANTED VERENA TO MAKE
VERENA HERSELF DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT HER MOTHER OCCUPIED A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE
MRS LUNA EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LIVING IN EUROPE FOR SEVERAL YEARS--EVER SINCE HER HUSBAND DIED--BUT HAD COME HOME A MONTH BEFORE COME HOME WITH HER LITTLE BOY THE ONLY THING SHE HAD IN THE WORLD AND WAS PAYING A VISIT TO HER SISTER WHO OF COURSE WAS THE NEAREST THING AFTER THE CHILD
SHE SAT THERE WITH CLOSED EYES AND HER FATHER NOW RESTED HIS LONG LEAN HANDS UPON HER HEAD
IF SHE HAD SUPPOSED HE WOULD AGREE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM
SHE HAD TAKEN FILTHY CHILDREN PICKED UP IN THE STREET TO HER OWN POOR ROOMS AND HAD REMOVED THEIR PESTILENT RAGS AND WASHED THEIR SORE BODIES WITH SLIPPERY LITTLE HANDS
XVIII VERENA TOLD HER A WEEK AFTER THIS THAT MR PARDON WANTED SO MUCH SHE SHOULD SAY SHE WOULD MARRY HIM
IN THE HALL THEY MET MR PARDON COMING UP FROM THE LOWER REGIONS WITH A JUG OF WATER AND A TUMBLER
SHE WAS HABITED IN A PLAIN DARK DRESS WITHOUT ANY ORNAMENTS AND HER SMOOTH COLOURLESS HAIR WAS CONFINED AS CAREFULLY AS THAT OF HER SISTER WAS ENCOURAGED TO STRAY
THE CHANCE AT ANY RATE WAS WORTH TAKING
SHE DOESN'T CARE A SPECK WHAT SHE WEARS--ONLY TO HAVE AN ELEGANT PARLOUR
HE CAME AND SEATED HIMSELF BY MISS CHANCELLOR AND BROACHED A LITERARY SUBJECT
YOU DON'T APPROVE OF OUR GREAT STRUGGLE--YOU WANT US TO BE KEPT DOWN THE OLD LADY SPOKE WITH PERFECT MILDNESS AS IF SHE HAD LONG AGO DONE WITH PASSION AND RESENTMENT
SHE COULDN'T HELP IT IF HE DID THINK HER DRY
SHE'S PERFECTLY DYING TO KNOW YOU MRS FARRINDER THESE WORDS EMANATED FROM ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN THE YOUNG MAN WITH WHITE HAIR WHO HAD BEEN MENTIONED TO RANSOM BY DOCTOR PRANCE AS A CELEBRATED MAGAZINIST
I CAN'T SAY I DO
OLIVE CHANCELLOR OFFERED BASIL RANSOM A GREETING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE CONSUMMATELY LADY-LIKE AND WHICH THE YOUNG MAN NARRATING THE SCENE SEVERAL MONTHS LATER TO MRS LUNA WHOSE SUSCEPTIBILITIES HE DID NOT FEEL HIMSELF OBLIGED TO CONSIDER SHE CONSIDERED HIS SO LITTLE DESCRIBED BY SAYING THAT SHE GLARED AT HIM
IF IT WERE A PART OF THE BOSTON CHARACTER TO BE INQUIRING HE WOULD BE TO THE LAST A COURTEOUS MISSISSIPPIAN
THEY WERE LIKE SOME BRILLIANT BIRTHDAY-PRESENT LEFT AT THE DOOR BY AN UNKNOWN MESSENGER TO BE DELIGHTFUL FOR EVER AS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE LEGACY AND AMUSING FOR EVER FROM THE OBSCURITY OF ITS SOURCE
WELL MOST PEOPLE DON'T OBJECT TO THAT
IF THAT'S TO BE YOUR SECRET I WILL KEEP IT RANSOM HEARD HER SUBJOIN
BUT SHE BEGGED HIM TO LET HER ALONE SHE ALMOST PUSHED HIM BACK
I'LL DO IT ALONE IF YOU PREFER VERENA SAID SOOTHINGLY TO HER FRIEND
SHE EXPRESSED THE HIGHEST ADMIRATION OF HER NEW FRIEND
THESE MAY BE SUMMED UP IN THE REMARK WHICH WILL DOUBTLESS STARTLE NO ONE BY ITS FRESHNESS THAT TWO IMPERIAL WOMEN ARE SCARCELY MORE LIKELY TO HIT IT OFF TOGETHER AS THE PHRASE IS THAN TWO IMPERIAL MEN
SHE SAID TO HIM THAT SHE PRESUMED THEY WOULD HAVE SOME ENTERTAINMENT SOON--MRS FARRINDER COULD BE INTERESTING WHEN SHE TRIED
IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS NOTHING SOOTHING ENOUGH WHEN A LADY ADOPTED THAT TONE ABOUT A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS THOUGHT BY SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST TO BE SO PROMISING
SO SHE HAD TO TAKE THE NEXT BEST--SHE HAD TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS HER DUTY TO SEE WHAT SHE SHOULD THINK OF A PLACE WHERE HER DAUGHTER SPENT SO MUCH TIME
MRS FARRINDER PROVED TO HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT THE EAGERNESS OF INSECURITY
THE UPSHOT OF THIS WAS THAT OLIVE THREW HERSELF ON VERENA'S NECK WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS HALF INDIGNATION HALF RAPTURE
IF HER LIFE STRUCK OTHERS IN THAT WAY--ESPECIALLY A WOMAN LIKE MRS FARRINDER WHOSE HORIZON WAS SO FULL--THEN THERE MUST BE SOMETHING FOR HER TO DO
SHE WAS WATCHING HIM TOO
WITH DEFERENCE TO MRS TARRANT A LITTLE MORE TALK WAS NECESSARY FOR THE YOUNG LADY HAD AS YET BEEN INSUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED
OLIVE CHANCELLOR MADE NO REJOINDER SAVE A LOW IMPATIENT SIGH
BUT AFTER SHE HAD CAUSED EVERY ONE TO CHANGE PLACES TWO OR THREE TIMES WITH EVERY ONE ELSE THE COMPANY SUBSIDED INTO A CIRCLE WHICH WAS OCCASIONALLY BROKEN BY WANDERING MOVEMENTS ON THE PART OF HER HUSBAND WHO IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING TO SAY ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER PLACED HIMSELF AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN LISTENING ATTITUDES SHAKING HIS HEAD SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND GAZING AT THE CARPET WITH AN AIR OF SUPERNATURAL ATTENTION
SHE HAD SAT ON THE KNEES OF SOMNAMBULISTS AND HAD BEEN PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND BY TRANCE-SPEAKERS
SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ENDS SHE CARED ABOUT BEGINNINGS
THEY HAD INVENTED IT WHILE SHE WAS AWAY
BUT HE DIDN'T IN THE LEAST LONG FOR THIS ARRANGEMENT AND WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE MOST PERTINENT SEQUEL TO HER CONJECTURE WOULD BE FOR HIM TO TAKE UP HIS HAT AND WALK AWAY
SUCH MOODS HOWEVER WERE NOT OFTEN REVEALED TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS--ONLY IT'S EXQUISITE
SOMETHING TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD BE AN UNFAVOURABLE ELEMENT
SHE DOESN'T WANT A PIANO--SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING SELAH REMARKED GIVING NO APPARENT ATTENTION TO HIS WIFE
IT WAS NEVER VERENA NOW WHO BEGAN FOR SHE HAD GROWN RATHER WEARY OF THE TOPIC
SHE WAS NOT SO HUNGRY FOR REVENGE AS OLIVE BUT AT THE LAST BEFORE THEY WENT TO EUROPE I SHALL TAKE NO PLACE TO DESCRIBE THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE THREW HERSELF INTO THAT PROJECT SHE QUITE AGREED WITH HER COMPANION THAT AFTER SO MANY AGES OF WRONG IT WOULD ALSO BE AFTER THE EUROPEAN JOURNEY MEN MUST TAKE THEIR TURN MEN MUST PAY
IN THIS CASE EVERY ONE WOULD BE SATISFIED
SHE'S GOING TO BEG HER FOR A SPEECH--MRS FARRINDER CAN'T RESIST THAT WELL THEN I'LL JUST TRICKLE OUT BEFORE SHE BEGINS
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH YOUR BEING THE FRESH BRIGHT CREATURE THAT YOU ARE
HE JERKED HIMSELF BACK AS IF HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF IT
WAS HE NOT LIKE A FRENCH GENTILHOMME DE PROVINCE AFTER THE REVOLUTION
SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT VERENA HAD NOT OBTAINED MORE INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF FASHION
AT THIS SHE TRANSFERRED HER EYES TO HIM GAZING AT HIM SOLEMNLY OUT OF THE PERVASIVE WINDOW OF HER SPECTACLES
THE GIRL HAD NOT YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASCERTAIN THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH HER MOTHER'S LIMPNESS WAS LIABLE SUDDENLY TO BECOME RIGID
IT RESEMBLED THE OCCASION THAT WE DESCRIBED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT MRS FARRINDER WAS NOT THERE TO OPPRESS THE COMPANY WITH HER GREATNESS AND THAT VERENA MADE A SPEECH WITHOUT THE CO-OPERATION OF HER FATHER
MY CARRIAGE MUST BE THERE--I MUST LEAVE YOU IN ANY CASE I CAN SEE YOU DON'T WANT IT SAID VERENA WONDERING
SHE HAD CHARM AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEMAND FOR THAT NOWADAYS IN CONNEXION WITH NEW IDEAS
NOT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HER HAPPINESS TO KNOW
OH YES SHE WOULD SPEAK NOW WITH PLEASURE
END OF VOL
I DON'T SAY BUT WHAT THE PLAINEST ARE THE BEST
IN THE LATTER CASE SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO JUSTLY VINDICTIVE IN COLD BLOOD
WELL I HOPE HE'LL GET SOMETHING FROM US I'M SURE
VERENA TOOK HER FATHER'S HANDS HELD THEM FOR A MOMENT WHILE SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM NOT LOOKING AT HIM WITH HER EYES TOWARDS THE COMPANY
FROM THIS TIME THERE WAS NO NEED OF PUTTING PRESSURE ON HER
THAT HE SHOULD BE MIXED UP IN ANY WAY WITH THIS EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS WAS A GREAT INJURY TO THE CAUSE AND OLIVE HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THAT IN FUTURE VERENA SHOULD DISPENSE WITH HIS CO-OPERATION
WITH ITS HABIT OF AN UPWARD ANGLE IT SEEMED TURNED TOWARD A PUBLIC SPEAKER WITH AN EFFORT OF RESPIRATION IN THE THICK AIR IN WHICH SOCIAL REFORMS ARE USUALLY DISCUSSED
AND MORE THAN ONE OF HER COMPANIONS IN THE COURSE OF THESE EXPEDITIONS HAD BEEN TARRED AND FEATHERED
I HOPED SO YOU WOULD SPEAK TO-NIGHT
IT WAS NOT HER MOTHER TRULY WHO HAD ASKED HIM IT WAS THE GIRL HERSELF
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR MUCH OF HER OCCUPATION WAS GONE
OLIVE SHRANK AT FIRST FROM FACING IT--NOT INDEED THE DECISION--FOR WE KNOW THAT HER OWN MIND HAD LONG SINCE BEEN MADE UP IN REGARD TO THE QUANTITY OF ESTEEM DUE TO ALMOST ANY MEMBER OF THE OTHER SEX--BUT THE INCIDENT ITSELF WHICH IF MR BURRAGE SHOULD EXASPERATE HER FURTHER MIGHT EXPOSE HER TO THE DANGER OF APPEARING TO VERENA TO BE UNFAIR TO HIM
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TIME SHE REALLY FELT HER AGE
THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT LEFT AS TO HER BEING VULGAR
I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OUT VERENA HAD LISTENED WITH EARNEST EYES
THIS COMPLICATED THE PROBLEM AND SUCH A COMPLICATION NATURALLY COULD NOT MAKE MRS FARRINDER APPEAR MORE EASY TO ASSIMILATE
THEN SHE ADDED
FOR STRANGE TO RECORD--IF ANYTHING IN A PERSON OF THAT INTENSE SENSIBILITY BE STRANGER THAN ANY OTHER--HER SECOND THOUGHT WITH REGARD TO HAVING ASKED HIM HAD DEEPENED WITH THE ELAPSING MOMENTS INTO AN UNREASONED TERROR OF THE EFFECT OF HIS PRESENCE
THE WHOLE GROUP HAD GOT UP AND VERENA CAME TO OLIVE WITH HER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED AND NO SIGNS OF A BAD CONSCIENCE IN HER BRIGHT FACE
OLIVE HAD ALWAYS HELD THAT PRIDE WAS NECESSARY TO CHARACTER BUT THERE WAS NO PECULIARITY OF VERENA'S THAT COULD MAKE HER SPIRIT SEEM LESS PURE
SHE WILL RUN OFF WITH SOME LION-TAMER
GOOD-NIGHT SIR SAID DOCTOR PRANCE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD BEGUN TO APPEAR TO RANSOM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE OF DOMESTICATION AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A SMALL FOREST-CREATURE A CATAMOUNT OR A RUFFLED DOE THAT HAD LEARNED TO STAND STILL WHILE YOU STROKED IT OR EVEN TO EXTEND A PAW
IT WAS SETTLED THEREFORE THAT MRS TARRANT SHOULD WITH HER DAUGHTER ACCEPT MR BURRAGE'S INVITATION
RANSOM PERCEIVED HOWEVER OR THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED THAT SHE RECOGNISED NOTHING
PERHAPS MISS BIRDSEYE WON'T LIKE YOU SHE WENT ON AS THEY WAITED FOR THE CARRIAGE
SHE WENT IN AS THE PHRASE IS FOR THE SUPERIOR PROGRAMMES AND THAT HIGH DIM DIGNIFIED MUSIC HALL WHICH HAS ECHOED IN ITS TIME TO SO MUCH ELOQUENCE AND SO MUCH MELODY AND OF WHICH THE VERY PROPORTIONS AND COLOUR SEEM TO TEACH RESPECT AND ATTENTION SHED THE PROTECTION OF ITS ILLUMINATED CORNICE THIS WINTER UPON NO FACES MORE INTELLIGENTLY UPTURNED THAN THOSE OF THE YOUNG WOMEN FOR WHOM BACH AND BEETHOVEN ONLY REPEATED IN A MYRIAD FORMS THE IDEA THAT WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM
ON HER TELLING HIM THAT SHE NEVER FOLLOWED ANYTHING OF THAT SORT HE UNDERTOOK A DEFENCE OF THE SERIAL SYSTEM WHICH SHE PRESENTLY REMINDED HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT ATTACKED
THE END OF THE COLLOQUY WAS THAT VERENA HAVING ASSENTED WITH HER USUAL DOCILITY TO HER COMPANION'S OPTIMISTIC CONTENTION THAT IT WAS A PHASE THIS TASTE FOR EVENING-CALLS FROM COLLEGIANS AND NEWSPAPER-MEN AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY PASS AWAY WITH THE GROWTH OF HER MIND REMARKED THAT THE INJUSTICE OF MEN MIGHT BE AN ACCIDENT OR MIGHT BE A PART OF THEIR NATURE BUT AT ANY RATE SHE SHOULD HAVE TO CHANGE A GOOD DEAL BEFORE SHE SHOULD WANT TO MARRY
HER OWN SPRINGS WERE WORKING
TO SKETCH EVEN PERHAPS THE LINES ON WHICH SHE INTENDED TO OPERATE DURING THE COMING WINTER
WELL I CAN'T SAY MUCH EXCEPT WHEN FATHER HAS WORKED ON ME VERENA ANSWERED WITH AN INGENUOUSNESS BESIDE WHICH HUMILITY WOULD HAVE SEEMED PRETENTIOUS
SUCH AN IMPRESSION HOWEVER WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM GOING INTO POLITICS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY OTHER WAY TO REPRESENT CONSTITUENCIES THAN BY BEING ELECTED
STILL THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THIS MERE PERSONAL ELATION IN THE SPLENDID SENTENTIOUSNESS WITH WHICH TURNING TO MR RANSOM SHE REMARKED
MRS TARRANT WITH HER SOFT CORPULENCE LOOKED TO HER GUEST VERY BLEACHED AND TUMID
MRS FARRINDER WAS PERCEPTIBLY IRRITATED
SHE CARED ABOUT THEM FOR THEMSELVES BELIEVED IN THEM ARDENTLY HAD THEM CONSTANTLY IN MIND
HE WAS IN TRUTH AN INSUFFERABLE CHILD ENTERTAINING FOR THE LATIN LANGUAGE A PERSONAL PHYSICAL HOSTILITY WHICH EXPRESSED ITSELF IN CONVULSIONS OF RAGE
SHE GUESSED MISS CHANCELLOR DIDN'T LIKE THIS HANDSOME JOKER IT WAS SO THAT BASIL RANSOM STRUCK HER
SHE REPROACHED HIM WITH NEGLECTING HER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM WHETHER HE HAD GROWN TOO FASHIONABLE FOR A PERSON WHO CARED ONLY FOR SERIOUS SOCIETY
IT CAME OVER HIM THAT IT WAS BECAUSE SHE TOOK THINGS HARD SHE HAD SOUGHT HIS ACQUAINTANCE
SHE HAD COME TO CONSIDER THE GIRL AS A WONDER OF WONDERS TO HOLD THAT NO HUMAN ORIGIN HOWEVER CONGRUOUS IT MIGHT SUPERFICIALLY APPEAR WOULD SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR HER
HE THOUGHT THIS PROSPECT FROM A CITY-HOUSE ALMOST ROMANTIC
AH WELL I SEE YOU ARE DRAWING HER OUT SAID MISS BIRDSEYE TO MRS FARRINDER
HER LIPS STIFFENED THEMSELVES AS SHE SPOKE
AND RED-FACED YELLOW-HAIRED BARE-ARMED VENDORS MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO LOUNGE IN THE DOORWAY
IT WAS STILL HER PURPOSE TO INTERPRET THE WORLD TO THE INGENIOUS MIND OF HER DAUGHTER AND SHE TRANSLATED MISS CHANCELLOR WITH A CONFIDENCE WHICH MADE LITTLE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT SHE HAD SEEN HER BUT ONCE WHILE VERENA HAD THIS ADVANTAGE NEARLY EVERY DAY
I WANT A STARTING-POINT--I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I AM SHE SAID
HE FELT AT ANY RATE THAT IF SHE HAD THE RELIGION OF HUMANITY--BASIL RANSOM HAD READ COMTE HE HAD READ EVERYTHING--SHE WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HIM
WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT BELIEF IN HER OWN ELOQUENCE BUT SHE WAS VERY ELOQUENT WHEN SHE REMINDED VERENA HOW THE EXQUISITE WEAKNESS OF WOMEN HAD NEVER BEEN THEIR DEFENCE BUT HAD ONLY EXPOSED THEM TO SUFFERINGS MORE ACUTE THAN MASCULINE GROSSNESS CAN CONCEIVE
FOR THE IDEA OF THE HOME LIKE MOST AMERICAN WOMEN OF HER QUALITY MRS TARRANT HAD AN EXTREME REVERENCE
AND I HOPE DOCTOR PRANCE IS WELL SHE LOOKS AFTER EVERY ONE'S HEALTH BUT HER OWN SAID MISS BIRDSEYE SMILING
AND OUR YOUNG LADY WAS VEXED AT NOT HEARING THAT SHE HAD LIVED FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS IN EUROPE AS THIS WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASY TO CLASSIFY HER AS ONE OF THE CORRUPT
AND SHE REPLIED THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE SHOULD HAVE MUCH TIME IN THE FUTURE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE WHO ALREADY APPROVED OF HER VIEWS
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE GOT ANY HEART AND I SHOULDN'T CARE MUCH IF YOU HAD YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THE WAY YOU SAY THAT INCREASES MY DESIRE TO HEAR YOU SPEAK DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SAID OLIVE ALMOST INAUDIBLY
AS THEY ROLLED TOWARD THE SOUTH END SIDE BY SIDE IN A GOOD DEAL OF SILENCE BOUNCING AND BUMPING OVER THE RAILWAY-TRACKS VERY LITTLE LESS AFTER ALL THAN IF THEIR WHEELS HAD BEEN FITTED TO THEM AND LOOKING OUT ON EITHER SIDE AT ROWS OF RED HOUSES DUSKY IN THE LAMP-LIGHT WITH PROTUBERANT FRONTS APPROACHED BY LADDERS OF STONE
OLIVE WAS SURE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TURN HER BACK UPON THEM WOULD ALWAYS SHARE WITH THEM
HE HARDLY KNEW IN WHAT LANGUAGE TO SPEAK TO HER
BUT HE HAD ARRIVED AT TWO OR THREE THAT WERE OF VALUE TO A GENTLEMAN LATELY ADMITTED TO THE NEW YORK BAR AND LOOKING OUT FOR CLIENTS
HE COULDN'T HOLD THE ATTENTION OF AN AUDIENCE HE WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS A LECTURER
AND IT WAS NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE LIKED IT THAT HE HAD COME
SHE HAD AS YET TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SENTIMENT OF FEAR
WHY DO WE TALK OF THIS
THE BENEFIT THAT HER FATHER DESIRED FOR HER WAS NOW ASSURED
BASIL RANSOM HAD LIVED BUT SHE KNEW HE HAD LIVED TO SEE BITTER HOURS
I CAN TELL YOU SHE KINDLES ME
YOU MUST PASS THROUGH A CERTAIN PHASE AND IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG IN ME TO PRETEND TO SUPPRESS IT
IT DOES COME BACK TO ME NOW WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE GROWTH OF THEIR INTIMACY
SHE HAD WORKED HARDER THAN ANY OF MISS CHANCELLOR'S SERVANTS
THIS HOWEVER WAS VERY APOCRYPHAL FOR SHE HAD NEVER POSSESSED ANYTHING AND IT WAS OPEN TO GRAVE DOUBT THAT SHE COULD HAVE ENTERTAINED A SENTIMENT SO PERSONAL
HE WANTED TO SEE HER IN A FRONT SEAT
THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS SEEMED TO HIM SO IDIOTIC THAT FOR WEEKS HE NEVER LOOKED AT ONE
I FEEL IT HERE
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF LOOKING HER UP AND SINCE THEN THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE IN NEW YORK HE MIGHT ASK ABOUT HER
BUT THOUGH OLIVE HAD NO VIEWS ABOUT THE MARRIAGE-TIE EXCEPT THAT SHE SHOULD HATE IT FOR HERSELF--THAT PARTICULAR REFORM SHE DID NOT PROPOSE TO CONSIDER--SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE OF CIRCLES IN WHICH SUCH INSTITUTIONS WERE CALLED INTO QUESTION
IT WAS SIMPLY AN INTENSELY PERSONAL EXHIBITION AND THE PERSON MAKING IT HAPPENED TO BE FASCINATING
SOLELY FOR HER FRIEND'S THAT IS AND THAT OF THE WHOLE ENSLAVED SISTERHOOD
SHE WAS RICH OR SUFFICIENTLY SO SHE WAS CONVENTIONAL AND TIMID VERY FOND OF ATTENTIONS FROM MEN WITH WHOM INDEED SHE WAS REPUTED BOLD BUT OLIVE SCORNED SUCH BOLDNESS AS THAT GIVEN UP TO A MERELY PERSONAL EGOTISTICAL INSTINCTIVE LIFE AND AS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE TENDENCIES OF THE AGE THE REVENGES OF THE FUTURE THE NEW TRUTHS AND THE GREAT SOCIAL QUESTIONS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A MERE BUNDLE OF DRESS-TRIMMINGS WHICH SHE VERY NEARLY WAS
THAT SOMEHOW WAS NOT A PART OF THE HIGHER LIFE WHICH EVERY ONE IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THEIRS MUST WISH ABOVE ALL THINGS TO LEAD
THE WINTER DAYS WERE STILL INDOORS IN CHARLES STREET AND THE WINTER NIGHTS SECURE FROM INTERRUPTION
HE CHUCKLED WITH A CERTAIN GRIMNESS AS THIS IMAGE PASSED BEFORE HIM
AS I HAVE ALSO MENTIONED HE WAS ABSENT FOR HOURS--LONG PERIODS DURING WHICH MRS TARRANT SUSTAINING NATURE WITH A HARD-BOILED EGG AND A DOUGHNUT WONDERED HOW IN THE WORLD HE STAYED HIS STOMACH
YOU SEEM VERY WELL ABLE TO SPEAK FOR YOURSELF SHE SPEAKS SO BEAUTIFULLY--IF SHE WOULD ONLY MAKE A LITTLE ADDRESS THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD INTRODUCED HER REMARKED
AND HIS LOOK EXPRESSED REAL SUSPENSE
OLIVE HAD THE PENETRATION TO DISCOVER IN A MOMENT THAT SHE WAS A CREATURE OF UNLIMITED GENEROSITY
WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
BUT VERENA NEVER CHANGED COLOUR
SHE'S A VERY REMARKABLE WOMAN TAKE CARE--DON'T BE RECKLESS CRIED MRS LUNA
BUT SHE WAS NOW SO COMPLETELY IN OLIVE'S HANDS THAT THERE WAS NO SACRIFICE TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSENTED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT HER BENEFACTRESS WAS NOT FRIVOLOUS
HER HUSBAND'S TASTES RUBBED OFF ON HER SOFT MOIST MORAL SURFACE AND THE COUPLE LIVED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF NOVELTY IN WHICH OCCASIONALLY THE ACCOMMODATING WIFE ENCOUNTERED THE FRESH SENSATION OF BEING IN WANT OF HER DINNER
OH WELL I GUESS THERE'S SOME KIND OF MYSTERIOUS LAW HE MURMURED ALMOST TIMIDLY
AND AS SHE TURNED HER FACE TO HIM HE SAW THAT SHE HAD FELT THE UNIVERSAL CONTAGION
I BELIEVE IT'S SOME ORIENTAL IDEA
IF OLIVE DIDN'T SAY AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS JEALOUS OF VERENA'S MORE ATTRACTIVE MANNER IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SUCH A DECLARATION WAS DESTINED TO PRODUCE MORE EFFECT A LITTLE LATER
WELL I HAD NO IDEA WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY WHEN I ASKED YOU
EVERYTHING SHE TURNED TO OR TOOK UP BECAME AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE FACILITY THE GIFTEDNESS WHICH OLIVE WHO HAD SO LITTLE OF IT NEVER CEASED TO WONDER AT AND PRIZE
HE RAISED HIS HAT AND WAVED HER A FAREWELL BUT SHE DIDN'T SEE HIM
I HOPE WITH ALL MY SOUL THAT YOU WON'T MARRY
BUT WE NEED IN STRICTNESS CONCERN OURSELVES WITH IT NO FURTHER THAN TO GATHER THE IMPLICATION THAT THE YOUNG MISSISSIPPIAN EVEN A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER THAT MOMENTOUS VISIT OF HIS TO BOSTON HAD NOT MADE HIS PROFESSION VERY LUCRATIVE
SHE BELONGED TO THE SHORT-SKIRTS LEAGUE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
HER TAKING UP VERENA TARRANT WAS ONLY A KIND OF ELDERLY RIDICULOUS DOLL-DRESSING
THERE WAS SOMETHING MARTIAL AND HEROIC IN HER PRETEXT AND BESIDES IT WAS SO CHARACTERISTIC SO FREE THAT MISS BIRDSEYE WAS QUITE CONSOLED AND WANDERED AWAY LOOKING AT HER OTHER GUESTS VAGUELY AS IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW THEM FROM EACH OTHER WHILE SHE MENTIONED TO THEM AT A VENTURE THE EXCUSE FOR THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT CONFIDENT EVIDENTLY THAT THEY WOULD AGREE WITH HER IT WAS VERY FINE
YOU'VE GOT TO LET THE SPIRIT COME OUT WHEN IT WILL HE THREW UP HIS ARMS AT MOMENTS TO RID HIMSELF OF THE WINGS OF HIS LONG WATERPROOF WHICH FELL FORWARD OVER HIS HANDS
IT WAS THE PERENNIAL FRESHNESS OF MISS BIRDSEYE'S FAITH THAT HAD HAD SUCH A CONTAGION FOR THESE MODERN MAIDENS THE UNQUENCHED FLAME OF HER TRANSCENDENTALISM THE SIMPLICITY OF HER VISION THE WAY IN WHICH IN SPITE OF MISTAKES DECEPTIONS THE CHANGING FASHIONS OF REFORM WHICH MAKE THE REMEDIES OF A PREVIOUS GENERATION LOOK AS RIDICULOUS AS THEIR BONNETS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS STILL ACTUAL FOR HER WAS THE ELEVATION OF THE SPECIES BY THE READING OF EMERSON AND THE FREQUENTATION OF TREMONT TEMPLE
SHE WITHHELD THIS INCIDENT FROM THE GIRL'S KNOWLEDGE REFLECTING WITH SOME SOLEMNITY THAT IT WAS THE FIRST DECEPTION FOR OLIVE HER SILENCE WAS A DECEPTION THAT SHE HAD YET PRACTISED ON HER FRIEND AND WONDERING WHETHER SHE SHOULD HAVE TO PRACTISE OTHERS IN THE FUTURE
HE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE EVENING--SOME IMPORTANT PAPERS WERE TO BE PREPARED
SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO HER LIFE AND SHE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
IT'S A VERY LONG WAY OLIVE REPLIED RATHER STERNLY
ARE YOU GOING INTO THAT BUSINESS MRS LUNA ASKED
I CAN SEE YOU ARE ANGRY AT SOMETHING VERENA SAID TO OLIVE AS THE TWO STOOD THERE IN THE STARLIGHT
SHE HAD REASON TO KNOW NOT THROUGH VERENA OF COURSE THAT MRS TARRANT HAD EMBRACED TENDERLY THE IDEA OF A PECUNIARY COMPENSATION AND THERE WAS NO FEAR OF HER MAKING A SCENE WHEN TARRANT SHOULD COME BACK WITH A CHEQUE IN HIS POCKET
HADN'T SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME
THESE PLANKS WERE EMBEDDED IN ICE OR IN LIQUID THAW ACCORDING TO THE MOMENTARY MOOD OF THE WEATHER AND THE ADVANCING PEDESTRIAN TRAVERSED THEM IN THE ATTITUDE AND WITH A GOOD DEAL OF THE SUSPENSE OF A ROPE-DANCER
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK HERSELF
BEING DOUBTLESS A LITTLE AMBITIOUS AND LIKING TO FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE APPRECIATED WORTH IN LOWLY FORMS HE HAD ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE RUDER BUT AT THE SAME TIME ACUTER PERSONALITY OF A GENUINE SON OF NEW ENGLAND WHO HAD A HARDER HEAD THAN HIS OWN AND A HUMOUR IN REALITY MORE CYNICAL AND WHO HAVING EARLIER KNOWLEDGE OF THE TARRANTS HAD UNDERTAKEN TO SHOW HIM SOMETHING INDIGENOUS AND CURIOUS POSSIBLY EVEN FASCINATING
HE KNEW NO ONE IN THE PLACE BUT OLIVE CHANCELLOR SO THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF A VISIT TO PAY
INDEED HE SCARCELY COULD THINK OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY WOULD BE A PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE TO HIM
WHEN I CARE FOR ANYTHING I CAN BE PATIENT SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO VERENA AND THE MOVEMENT WAS AT ONCE SO APPEALING AND SO CONFIDENT THAT THE GIRL INSTINCTIVELY PLACED HER OWN IN IT
BUT BY THE TIME I GET TO SLEEP I HAVE TO GET UP
SHE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW LITTLE HIS OWN VIEWS COULD BE GATHERED FROM SUCH A LIMITED ADMISSION
SHE HAD HAD ESCAPES IN THE EARLY DAYS OF ABOLITIONISM WHICH IT WAS A MARVEL SHE COULD TELL WITH SO LITTLE IMPLICATION THAT SHE HAD SHOWN COURAGE
HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOT MADE AS YET ANY VERY EAGER INQUIRY ABOUT NEWTON WHO AT THIS LATE HOUR HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE ONLY INFLUENCE THAT TAMES THE UNTAMABLE AND WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF CHILDHOOD IF NOT OF INNOCENCE
NEVER IN THE WORLD--I AM VERY RICH
THE CHEAPEST KIND OF HUMAN PRODUCT
AND THE DECLARATION HAD A POINT FOR MISS BIRDSEYE AT THIS MOMENT REAPPEARED FOLLOWED BY THE MESMERIC HEALER AND HIS WIFE
I HARDLY KNOW HOWEVER WHAT ILLUMINATION IT WAS THAT SPRANG FROM HER CONSCIOUSNESS NOW A SOURCE OF CONSIDERABLE COMFORT THAT MRS FARRINDER WAS CARRYING THE WAR INTO DISTANT TERRITORIES AND WOULD RETURN TO BOSTON ONLY IN TIME TO PRESIDE AT A GRAND FEMALE CONVENTION ALREADY ADVERTISED TO TAKE PLACE IN BOSTON IN THE MONTH OF JUNE
VERENA HAD NOT INVENTED IT BUT SHE HAD TAKEN IT EAGERLY FROM HER FRIEND AND SHE RETURNED IT WITH INTEREST
THEN I FEEL--I FEEL AS I IMAGINE NAPOLEON BONAPARTE TO HAVE FELT ON THE EVE OF ONE OF HIS GREAT VICTORIES
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY THERE
BUT I USE THE WORD NOT IN ITS DERIVED BUT IN ITS LITERAL SENSE
THEIR LINE WAS PERVERSE BUT IT WAS NOT POOR
AND I SAY TO HER THAT IF I DO IT WILL BE ALL HER INFLUENCE SELAH TARRANT LOOKED AT ALL THIS FROM A HIGHER STANDPOINT THAN HIS WIFE
IT HARDLY SEEMED DIRECT TO POOR VERENA PERHAPS WHO IN THE CROWDED STREET-CAR WHICH DEPOSITED HER FINALLY AT MISS CHANCELLOR'S DOOR HAD TO STAND UP ALL THE WAY HALF SUSPENDED BY A LEATHERN STRAP FROM THE GLAZED ROOF OF THE STIFLING VEHICLE LIKE SOME BLOOMING CLUSTER DANGLING IN A HOTHOUSE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IN ADVANCE HOW MRS TARRANT WOULD TAKE THINGS
HE GROUND HIS TEETH A LITTLE AS HE THOUGHT OF THE CONTRASTS OF THE HUMAN LOT
SHE HAD ASKED HIM AFTER ALL NOT TO COME
BUT IN SPITE OF IT MISS TARRANT SPENDS A PART OF HER TIME WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER YES SHE SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR EVERY ONE
SHE ONLY SAID WE WANT THE YOUNG--OF COURSE WE WANT THE YOUNG WHO IS THAT CHARMING CREATURE BASIL RANSOM HEARD HIS COUSIN ASK IN A GRAVE LOWERED TONE OF MATTHIAS PARDON THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BROUGHT MISS TARRANT FORWARD
SHE COULD TELL BY THEIR MANNER OF LIFE THAT THEY HADN'T RAKED IN THE DOLLARS
HE CONTINUED TO COME AND IT WAS THEREFORE TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD CEASED TO COUNT ON SUCH A CONCESSION
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HELEN OF TROY AND THE FEARFUL CARNAGE SHE EXCITED
NOW WHAT HE TRIED FOR WAS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THE LEAST IDEA
ARE YOU AGAINST OUR EMANCIPATION SHE ASKED TURNING A WHITE FACE ON HIM IN THE MOMENTARY RADIANCE OF A STREET-LAMP
BUT SAVE FOR THIS ALLUDED TO NOTHING MORE TRIVIAL THAN THE REGENERATION OF HUMANITY AND THE STRONG HOPE HE FELT THAT MISS BIRDSEYE WOULD AGAIN HAVE ONE OF HER DELIGHTFUL GATHERINGS
BASIL RANSOM DID NOT DIVINE ALL THIS BUT HE DIVINED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT MRS LUNA WROTE HIM LITTLE NOTES EVERY OTHER DAY THAT SHE PROPOSED TO DRIVE HIM IN THE PARK AT UNNATURAL HOURS AND THAT WHEN HE SAID HE HAD HIS BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO SHE REPLIED
SHE WATCHED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM
THE GIRL HAD VIRTUALLY CONFESSED THAT SHE LENT HERSELF TO IT ONLY BECAUSE IT GAVE HIM PLEASURE AND THAT ANYTHING ELSE WOULD DO AS WELL ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE HER QUIET A LITTLE BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO GIVE OUT OLIVE TOOK UPON HERSELF TO BELIEVE THAT SHE COULD MAKE HER QUIET THOUGH CERTAINLY SHE HAD NEVER HAD THAT EFFECT UPON ANY ONE
SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE TUNING-UP SHE WANTED TO BREAK RIGHT OUT
BY THIS TIME A CERTAIN AGITATION WAS PERCEPTIBLE
ONE OF HIS ROOMS WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE STREET-DOOR OF THE HOUSE
HER SHYNESS HAD QUITE LEFT HER IT DID NOT COME BACK
AT LAST WHEN HE WAS ON THE POINT OF EXPOSING HIMSELF BY A DIRECT INQUIRY HE REFLECTED THAT THE EXPOSURE WOULD IN ANY CASE NOT BE LONG AVERTED SHE ANTICIPATED HIM BY SAYING IN A MANNER WHICH SHOWED THAT HER THOUGHTS HAD CONTINUED IN THE SAME TRAIN I WONDER VERY MUCH THAT MISS TARRANT DIDN'T AFFECT YOU THAT EVENING AH BUT SHE DID RANSOM SAID WITH ALACRITY
IN HER TRANSIT HOWEVER THE HOSTESS WAS CHECKED BY THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH PILGRIMS
TWO OR THREE HAD RETAINED THEIR OVERSHOES AND AS YOU APPROACHED THEM THE ODOUR OF THE INDIA-RUBBER WAS PERCEPTIBLE
VERENA REFLECTED A MOMENT AND THEN ANSWERED SMILING BUT WITH CONFIDENCE
WELL I AIN'T DISAPPOINTED THE STURDY LITTLE DOCTRESS REPLIED
A LARGE BENIGNANT FACE CAGED IN BY THE GLASS OF HER SPECTACLES WHICH SEEMED TO COVER IT ALMOST EQUALLY EVERYWHERE AND A FAT RUSTY SATCHEL WHICH HUNG LOW AT HER SIDE AS IF IT WEARIED HER TO CARRY IT
IF THEY WERE ALL IN ALL TO EACH OTHER WHAT MORE COULD THEY WANT
THAT SHE WAS NOT SO LOW DOWN IN THE WORLD AS NOT TO KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A CEREMONY AS LEAVING CARDS
NO NOT EVEN MISS TARRANT IN SPITE OF HIS LONG ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER
OLIVE ALWAYS ABSENTED HERSELF WHEN MR BURRAGE WAS ANNOUNCED
AND THE IDEA MADE ME FOR THE MOMENT FRANTIC
SUCH A HOUSE INHABITED IN SUCH A WAY BY A QUIET SPINSTER IMPLIED A CONSIDERABLE INCOME
HE EXPRESSED A HOPE AT THE SAME TIME THAT OLIVE HAD NOT ANY VIEWS THAT WOULD LEAD HER TO BRING HER INFLUENCE TO BEAR TO MAKE MISS VERENA HOLD BACK
SHE DREW VERENA OUT INTO THE DARK FRESHNESS CLOSING THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE BEHIND HER
HE IS VERY GOOD VERENA SAID SIMPLY
HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS WAS RATHER AN ANOMALY AND HIS CONSCIOUSNESS MADE HIM HAD ALREADY MADE HIM DISSIMULATE SLIGHTLY
IT'S TOO LOVELY TO SEE YOU MRS FARRINDER SO SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF WHILE THE COMPANY WATCHED THE ENCOUNTER WITH A LOOK OF REFRESHED INANITION
YOUR DANGER WOULD COME FROM AN ATTRACTIVE ONE I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU ADMIT THAT SOME ARE ATTRACTIVE VERENA EXCLAIMED WITH THE LIGHT LAUGH WHICH HER REVERENCE FOR MISS CHANCELLOR HAD NOT YET QUENCHED
MY SISTER HAS THE FIRST CLAIM
THERE ARE GENTLEMEN IN PLENTY WHO WOULD BE GLAD TO STOP YOUR MOUTH BY KISSING YOU
OLIVE'S DISPLEASURES DISAPPOINTMENTS DISAPPROVALS WERE TRAGIC TRULY MEMORABLE
EVEN TO VERENA AS WE KNOW SHE WAS CONFUSED AND CONFUSING
SHE SHOULD HAVE FACTS AND FIGURES
HE PERCEIVED VERY QUICKLY THAT MISS CHANCELLOR BELONGED TO THE FORMER CLASS
THOUGH HE THOUGHT THE AGE TOO TALKATIVE AS I HAVE HINTED HE LIKED TO TALK AS WELL AS ANY ONE
THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE UNMARRIED BY ACCIDENT AND OTHERS WHO ARE UNMARRIED BY OPTION
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
YES SHE WAS PRETTY-APPEARING BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN INDICATION OF ANAEMIA AND DOCTOR PRANCE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF SHE DIDN'T EAT TOO MUCH CANDY
OLIVE WAS EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MUSIC AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HER NOT TO BE SOOTHED AND BEGUILED BY THE YOUNG MAN'S CHARMING ART
A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS--IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
SHE WAS NOT MEANT FOR THAT AND OLIVE WOULD SAVE HER
HER EYES RESTED ON HIM AND AS SHE SAW THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HER SHE DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE CEREMONY SHE HAD BROKEN SO COMPLETELY WITH ALL CONVENTIONS OF REMOVING THEM
AS THEY DREW TO THE CLOSE OF A MEAL WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL LATENT INCOMPATIBILITIES HAD GONE OFF BRILLIANTLY SHE SAID TO HIM THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO LEAVE HIM AFTER DINNER UNLESS PERHAPS HE SHOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCOMPANY HER
BUT SHE COULDN'T STAND THAT--SHE KNEW AT LEAST WHAT SHE HAD NOT COME BACK FOR
THIS WAS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS WHEN THE VISIT TO HIS ROOMS TOOK PLACE
SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS AND MADE NO COMMENT ON HIS ANSWERS WHICH ONLY SERVED TO SUGGEST TO HER FRESH INQUIRIES
OLIVE SAW THE DIFFERENCE AND YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW SHE REJOICED IN IT
MISS TARRANT OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING AFFECTED ME AS YOU SAY IN THIS WAY--THAT I THINK MORE HIGHLY STILL IF POSSIBLE OF THE SEX WHICH PRODUCED SUCH A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG LADY WELL WE THINK EVERYTHING OF HER HERE SAID MISS BIRDSEYE
SHE WANTS TO KNOW HOW I CAN SPEAK THE WAY I DO UNLESS I FEEL
SHE ONLY WONDERED A LITTLE HOW HER MOTHER KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT MISS CHANCELLOR JUST FROM LOOKING AT HER ONCE
IT SOMETIMES SEEMS AS IF THERE WEREN'T ANY YOU COULD LIKE I CAN IMAGINE A MAN I SHOULD LIKE VERY MUCH OLIVE REPLIED AFTER A MOMENT
OF COURSE YOU CONVINCED ME
AS THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT HER FINGERS PLAYED SOFTLY A LITTLE AIR UPON THE PANE
IT WAS NOT EVERY ONE THAT WOULD CARE TO KNOW A PERSON WHO HAD BORNE SUCH A PART IN THE SOUTHERN DISLOYALTY
YET SHE SMILED WITH ALL HER RADIANCE AS SHE LOOKED FROM MISS CHANCELLOR TO HIM
VERENA TOOK LIFE AS YET VERY SIMPLY
THE YOUNG MISSISSIPPIAN HAD COME TO DINE WITH HER
BUT IT WAS THE NEXT THING TO IT
TO WHICH ANOTHER REPLIED THAT SHE WONDERED ONE OF THEIR BRIGHT WOMEN HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
BUT I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED--WHAT THEY CALL WONDERS I SUPPOSE DIDN'T YOU SEE HER WHEN SHE RETURNED BASIL RANSOM ASKED
SHE KNEW HIM BECAUSE SHE HAD MET HIM IN SOCIETY
BUT EVEN WITH THIS RATHER LIVELY EXCHANGE OF VOWS HE FELT THAT HE HAD GOT OFF RATHER EASILY
MRS LUNA WAS ON HER WAY DOWNSTAIRS AND HER COMPANIONS REMAINED FACE TO FACE
MRS LUNA HAD COMPLAINED OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF INSTALLING ONE'S SELF IN AMERICA BUT RANSOM REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED AN IMPRESSION SIMILAR TO THIS IN HER SISTER'S HOUSE IN BOSTON AND REFLECTED THAT THESE LADIES HAD AS A FAMILY-TRAIT THE ART OF MAKING THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE
THE PAVEMENT TOWARD THE GUTTERS WAS FRINGED WITH DIRTY PANNIERS HEAPED WITH POTATOES CARROTS AND ONIONS
MR PARDON WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF DR TARRANT DIDN'T SEE HIS WAY TO DO SOMETHING HE SHOULD FEEL AS IF HE SHOULD WANT TO TAKE HOLD HIMSELF
THERE'S MONEY FOR SOME ONE IN THAT GIRL
HE HAD NOT SEEKING HIS FORTUNE COME AWAY FROM THE BLIGHTED SOUTH WHICH WEIGHED UPON HIS HEART TO LOOK OUT FOR TRAGEDIES
HE WAS AN IMMENSE ADMIRER OF THE LATE THOMAS CARLYLE AND WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF THE ENCROACHMENTS OF MODERN DEMOCRACY
THE PERFORMANCE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN VERY EASY TO HER AND THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A KIND OF IMPERTINENCE IN HER AIR OF NOT HAVING SUFFERED FROM AN EXERTION WHICH HAD WROUGHT SO POWERFULLY ON EVERY ONE ELSE
IT WAS PARTLY HER PRIDE AT ANY RATE SHE CHOSE TO GIVE IT THIS TURN THAT HER HOUSE HAD FOR MANY YEARS BEEN CONDUCTED WITHOUT THE ELEMENT--SO DEBASING ON BOTH SIDES--OF SERVILE MERCENARY LABOUR
SHE MADE NO INQUIRY ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS NEVER ASKED IF HE HAD BEEN BUSY AND PROSPEROUS
SHE HAD NO PARTICULAR FEELING ABOUT HERSELF
IT HAD BEEN BECAUSE SHE WAS STRENUOUS NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS GENIAL
DID YOU GET IN ON PURPOSE QUITE ON PURPOSE
MR PARDON WAS NOT CONCEITED MORE AT LEAST THAN IS PROPER WHEN YOUTH AND SUCCESS GO HAND IN HAND AND IT WAS NATURAL HE SHOULD NOT KNOW IN WHAT SPIRIT MISS CHANCELLOR LISTENED TO HIM
OR AT ANY RATE SHE APPEARED SO TO VERENA WHO FELT THAT THROUGH SUCH AN ASSOCIATION ONE MIGHT AT LAST INTELLECTUALLY COMMAND ALL LIFE
SHE ASKED HERSELF WHETHER AFTER ALL IT WAS ANY MORE THAN NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE WANTED TO HELP HER HUSBAND IN THOSE EXCITING DAYS OF HIS MEDIUMSHIP WHEN THE TABLE SOMETIMES WOULDN'T RISE FROM THE GROUND THE SOFA WOULDN'T FLOAT THROUGH THE AIR AND THE SOFT HAND OF A LOST LOVED ONE WAS NOT SO ALERT AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO VISIT THE CIRCLE
THE TRUTH WAS MISS VERENA WANTED TO SHED HER FATHER ALTOGETHER
SHE HAD NO IDEA SHE HAD MENTIONED THE OCCASION TO SO MANY PEOPLE--SHE ONLY REMEMBERED AS IT WERE THOSE SHE HAD FORGOTTEN--AND IT WAS CERTAINLY A PROOF OF THE INTEREST FELT IN MRS FARRINDER'S WORK
ADELINE'S AFFAIRS AS I HAVE INTIMATED HER SOCIAL RELATIONS HER VIEWS OF NEWTON'S EDUCATION HER PRACTICE AND HER THEORY FOR SHE HAD PLENTY OF THAT SUCH AS IT WAS HEAVEN SAVE THE MARK HER SPASMODIC DISPOSITION TO MARRY AGAIN AND HER STILL SILLIER RETREATS IN THE PRESENCE OF DANGER FOR SHE HAD NOT EVEN THE COURAGE OF HER FRIVOLITY THESE THINGS HAD BEEN A SUBJECT OF TRAGIC CONSIDERATION TO OLIVE EVER SINCE THE RETURN OF THE ELDER SISTER TO AMERICA
THE ABOLITIONISTS BROUGHT IT ON AND WERE NOT THE ABOLITIONISTS PRINCIPALLY FEMALES
BUT IT WAS A PART OF HER ORIGINALITY AS IT WERE THAT SHE WAS DELICIOUSLY PROVINCIAL
PRODUCING A PRESSURE THAT SHALL BE IRRESISTIBLE
BASIL RANSOM WOULD HAVE DESPISED HIMSELF IF HE HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF CONFESSING TO A WOMAN THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE A LIVING
THE YOUNG MAN LEFT ALONE LOOKED ABOUT THE PARLOUR--THE TWO PARLOURS WHICH IN THEIR PROLONGED ADJACENT NARROWNESS FORMED EVIDENTLY ONE APARTMENT--AND WANDERED TO THE WINDOWS AT THE BACK WHERE THERE WAS A VIEW OF THE WATER
THERE WAS HOWEVER SOMETHING RICH IN THE FAIRNESS OF THIS YOUNG LADY
I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN RANSOM CONTINUED
SHE HAD AN AIR OF DISSUASION ALMOST AS SOLEMN AS HER FORMER PRESSURE
AND AT EVERY CORNER HE STOPPED A MINUTE LINGERED IN MEDITATION WHILE HE EXHALED A SOFT VAGUE SIGH
IT'S WORTH ANY WOMAN'S WHILE TO BE ADMIRED AS I ADMIRE YOU
IT WAS OF COURSE VERY WRETCHED TO BE IRRITATED BY SUCH MISTAKES
SHE HAD PRIVATE PANGS AT COMMITTING HERSELF TO GIVE THE COLD SHOULDER TO BEACON STREET FOR EVER
SHE HAD MET NO ONE AS YET BUT MRS LUNA
HE HAD BEEN INVITED BY THE LITTLE PROPHETESS AND YET HE HAD NOT BEEN INVITED
THE VOICE OF THEIR SILENT SUFFERING WAS ALWAYS IN HER EARS THE OCEAN OF TEARS THAT THEY HAD SHED FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME SEEMED TO POUR THROUGH HER OWN EYES
THIS LEAN PALE SALLOW SHABBY STRIKING YOUNG MAN WITH HIS SUPERIOR HEAD HIS SEDENTARY SHOULDERS HIS EXPRESSION OF BRIGHT GRIMNESS AND HARD ENTHUSIASM HIS PROVINCIAL DISTINGUISHED APPEARANCE IS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS SEX THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAGE IN MY NARRATIVE
MISS CHANCELLOR RAISED A WARNING FINGER
A SUBTLE FIRE PASSED INTO HER
THE YOUNG MAN FELT THAT HE HAD SILENCED HER AND HE WAS VERY SORRY
SHE REMAINED SILENT A LITTLE AFTER HER LAST REMARK AND THEN SHE REPEATED AGAIN AS IF IT WERE THE SOLUTION OF EVERYTHING AS IF IT REPRESENTED WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY SOME IMMENSE HAPPINESS IN THE FUTURE--"WE MUST WAIT WE MUST WAIT VERENA WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO WAIT THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TO WAIT FOR AND THE ASPIRING FRANKNESS OF HER ASSENT SHONE OUT OF HER FACE AND SEEMED TO PACIFY THEIR MUTUAL GAZE
THOUGH SHE HAD GROWN UP AMONG PEOPLE WHO TOOK FOR GRANTED ALL SORTS OF QUEER LAXITIES SHE HAD KEPT THE CONSUMMATE INNOCENCE OF THE AMERICAN GIRL THAT INNOCENCE WHICH WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL FOR IT HAD SURVIVED THE ABOLITION OF WALLS AND LOCKS
IT WAS AS IF THE TOUCH OF THE AIR ITSELF WERE GLOVED AND THE STREET-COLOURING HAD THE RICHNESS OF A SUPERFICIAL THAW
BUT TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THIS YOUNG WOMAN ANSWERED HER BY A QUESTION INTENDED TO CHECK SUCH RASHNESS
AND HE HAD FOR A MOMENT A WHIMSICAL VISION OF BECOMING A PARTNER IN SO FLOURISHING A FIRM
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HER PART WAS BEFORE THE SCENES NOT BEHIND
BUT I AM NOT SURE YOU ARE WORTHY IS IT SOMETHING VERY BOSTONIAN
AS YET THE EXHIBITION WAS NOT EXCITING THOUGH IT WAS CERTAINLY PLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL PLACED THERE BEFORE ONE LIKE A MOVING STATUE
PERHAPS YOU LIKE ME TOO MUCH OF COURSE I LIKE YOU TOO MUCH
OLIVE COULD ENTER TO A CERTAIN EXTENT INTO THAT
OLIVE THOUGHT AFTERWARDS THAT IF A COLLECTION COULD ONLY BE TAKEN UP ON THE SPOT THE GOOD LADY WOULD BE MADE EASY FOR THE REST OF HER DAYS
IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT APPRECIABLY NEARER BY THAT FORTUNATE EVENING AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S
FOR SOME MINUTES HER EYES HAD REMAINED CLOSED
SHE HAD ALWAYS HAD FOR OLIVE A KIND OF AROMA OF MARTYRDOM AND HER BATTERED UNREMUNERATED UN-PENSIONED OLD AGE BROUGHT ANGRY TEARS SPRINGING FROM DEPTHS OF OUTRAGED THEORY INTO MISS CHANCELLOR'S EYES
MOTHER IF SHE DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION TO ME THERE ISN'T ANY ATTENTION TO BE ATTRACTED
WISHED THE SITUATION TO BE CLEAR SO THAT DISAGREEABLE AS IT WOULD BE TO HER TO RECEIVE HIM SHE SENT HIM A SUMMONS FOR A CERTAIN HOUR--AN HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD PLANNED THAT VERENA SHOULD BE OUT OF THE HOUSE
SHE TOOK THIS UNPOPULAR LINE BOTH BY TEMPERAMENT AND BY REACTION FROM HER SISTER'S EXTREME VIEWS THE SIGHT OF THE DREADFUL PEOPLE THAT THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HER
AND THE LOOK WITH WHICH SHE REPLIED TO HIM AT THE END OF THIS LITTLE TIRADE WHY SIR YOU OUGHT TO TAKE THE PLATFORM TOO
IT MUST BE ADDED THAT OF LATE THIS SANDY SURFACE HAD BEEN IRRIGATED IN MODERATION FROM ANOTHER SOURCE
BUT VERENA HAD AN INNER SENSE SHE JUDGED HER MOTHER NOW A LITTLE FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE WOULD BE SORRY TO BE TAKEN AT HER WORD AND THAT SHE FELT SAFE ENOUGH IN TRUSTING TO HER DAUGHTER'S GENEROSITY
WELL I HAVE HEARD AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S SOME INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKING OLIVE CHANCELLOR WAS DETERMINED TO LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AS SHE SAID THIS
MRS FARRINDER HAD BEHAVED IN THE STRANGEST WAY ABOUT VERENA
SHE WILL NEVER BE OLD
POOR OLIVE WAS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS ENTANGLED IN CONTRADICTIONS
MEANWHILE AT ANY RATE SELAH WAS SURE HE HAD A CARD
RANSOM HAD TO FIND HIS TIME IN THE AFTERNOON
OLIVE HAD THOUGHT IT VERY POSSIBLE HE WOULD COME THAT DAY IF HE WAS TO LEAVE BOSTON
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM HER COMMON HABIT THAN TO ENTERTAIN ALONE AT ANY REPAST A GENTLEMAN SHE HAD NEVER SEEN
AND THERE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL TO THINK OF TO MAP OUT
HE HEARD A LADY NEAR HIM APPARENTLY FAMILIAR WITH PHENOMENA OF THIS CLASS REMARK THAT SHE WAS GOING OFF
IN SAYING SO HOWEVER I BETRAY HIM A LITTLE FOR HE NEVER MENTIONED SUCH FEELINGS AS THESE
BY THE WAY MISS BIRDSEYE PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS NOT TO MENTION THIS MEETING OF OURS TO MY COUSIN IN CASE OF YOUR SEEING HER AGAIN
THE YELLOW LIGHT IN HIS BROWN EYES DEEPENED
ONE OF THESE WAS SIMPLY THE SOCIETY OF OLD MISS BIRDSEYE OF WHOM OLIVE SAW MORE THIS WINTER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SHE DIDN'T INTERPRET NOR SEE THE PORTEE OF WHAT SHE DESCRIBED
AS REGARDS THE PECUNIARY TRANSACTION WITH SELAH IT WAS STRANGE HOW SHE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT THROUGH THE CONVICTION THAT VERENA WOULD NEVER GIVE UP HER PARENTS
MISS CHANCELLOR'S HACKNEY-COACH WAS THERE AND WHEN BASIL HAD PUT HER INTO IT SHE SAID TO HIM THAT SHE WOULDN'T TROUBLE HIM TO DRIVE WITH HER--HIS HOTEL WAS NOT NEAR CHARLES STREET
SHE DOESN'T LIKE FRENCH IDEAS AS A GENERAL THING
IT MADE HER FEEL ALMOST INSPIRED
IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR THEM YOU WON'T GO WITH US I TELL YOU I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA WHAT THEY ARE
I HAVE NO FACILITY
HE LOWERED HIS VOICE STILL MORE AND REVEALED TO MISS CHANCELLOR HIS INNERMOST THOUGHT HAVING FIRST ASSURED HIMSELF THAT SELAH WAS STILL ABSENT AND THAT MRS TARRANT WAS INQUIRING OF MR BURRAGE WHETHER HE VISITED MUCH ON THE NEW LAND
I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE
YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING OH YES AND WE WANT TO BE AT THE TOP SAID VERENA
YOU USED TO COME TO SEE ME THEN OH YES I REMEMBER RANSOM SAID RATHER MUSINGLY
IT MAKES ME SICK THIS WAS HER HOSTESS'S RESPONSE TO MISS CHANCELLOR'S VERY SUMMARY FAREWELL UTTERED AS THE THREE LADIES PROCEEDED TOGETHER TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
YOUR VEIL IS NOT PUT ON STRAIGHT ADELINE I LOOK LIKE A MONSTER--THAT EVIDENTLY IS WHAT YOU MEAN ADELINE EXCLAIMED GOING TO THE MIRROR TO REARRANGE THE PECCANT TISSUE
EVEN THE YOUNG MISSISSIPPIAN HAD CULTURE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT SHE WAS REFINED
HE SEEMED TO WANT SO MUCH TO ENJOY LIFE AND TO THINK YOU EASILY COULD IF YOU WOULD ONLY LET YOURSELF GO
AND AFTER HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SEEMED TO SEE THE GLOW OF DAWNING SUCCESS
AND THERE IS THAT PRETTY YOUNG LADY GOING OVER TO SPEAK TO MRS FARRINDER
BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT AFTER SUCH EXERTIONS SHE HAD THE REFRESHMENT OF A PRETTY HOUSE A DRAWING-ROOM FULL OF FLOWERS A CRACKLING HEARTH WHERE SHE THREW IN PINE-CONES AND MADE THEM SNAP AN IMPORTED TEA-SERVICE A CHICKERING PIANO AND THE DEUTSCHE RUNDSCHAU
HE HAD THE MOST DEFINITE NOTIONS ABOUT THEIR PLACE IN NATURE IN SOCIETY AND WAS PERFECTLY EASY IN HIS MIND AS TO WHETHER IT EXCLUDED THEM FROM ANY PROPER HOMAGE
THERE WAS ROOM FOR BOTH NO DOUBT THEY HAD SUCH A DIFFERENT STYLE
WELL HE KNOWS PLENTY OF THAT SORT MRS TARRANT WENT ON BUT HE FELT UNSATISFIED
FOR SHE BELONGED TO ANY AND EVERY LEAGUE THAT HAD BEEN FOUNDED FOR ALMOST ANY PURPOSE WHATEVER
YOU SEE I AM VERY CALM NOW
ISN'T SHE A DEAR OLD THING THIS BRIDGE HE SAW WOULD NOT BEAR HIS WEIGHT AND HER QUESTION SEEMED TO HIM TO HAVE MORE AUDACITY THAN SENSE
THE WORLD WAS FULL OF EVIL BUT SHE WAS GLAD TO HAVE BEEN BORN BEFORE IT HAD BEEN SWEPT AWAY WHILE IT WAS STILL THERE TO FACE TO GIVE ONE A TASK AND A REWARD
AND HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED AS A FORTUNATE OPENING TO BE REALLY VERY FRANK
IX RANSOM APPROACHED MRS FARRINDER AGAIN WHO HAD REMAINED ON HER SOFA WITH OLIVE CHANCELLOR
HE WAS NOT OF A MERCENARY SPIRIT BUT HE HAD AN IMMENSE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS AND HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE REFLECTED THAT A MODERATE CAPITAL WAS AN AID TO ACHIEVEMENT
SEVERAL MONTHS HAD ELAPSED AND HE WAS NO NEARER TO THE SORT OF SUCCESS HE HAD HOPED FOR
HIS NECESSITY GAVE A POINT TO THE REMINISCENCES SHE EVOKED
SHE TALKED TO RANSOM ABOUT THE INFERIORITY OF REPUBLICS THE DISTRESSING PERSONS SHE HAD MET ABROAD IN THE LEGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES THE BAD MANNERS OF SERVANTS AND SHOPKEEPERS IN THAT COUNTRY THE HOPE SHE ENTERTAINED THAT THE GOOD OLD FAMILIES WOULD MAKE A STAND
OLIVE COULD SEE HOW FEW BOOKS HAD PASSED THROUGH VERENA'S HANDS AND HOW LITTLE THE HOME OF THE TARRANTS HAD BEEN A HOUSE OF READING
AND HE'S WONDERFULLY MAGNETIC IT ISN'T YOUR FATHER AND IT ISN'T YOUR MOTHER
AMONG THESE SOFT INFLUENCES VERENA HERSELF BLOOMED LIKE THE FLOWER THAT ATTAINS SUCH PERFECTION IN BOSTON
THERE HAD BEEN A SPIRITUALIST PAPER OF OLD WHICH HE USED TO PERVADE
MISS BIRDSEYE HAD BEEN WATCHING HER BLUE CAR THE ADVANCE OF WHICH WAS TEMPORARILY OBSTRUCTED
THIS OF COURSE GAVE HER A CHANCE TO SAY THAT HE HAD TREATED HER EVEN WORSE THAN SHE SUPPOSED
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE ADDRESS CAME TO HER--THE RESIDENCE OF THE MESMERIC HEALER WAS IN MONADNOC PLACE
THEY HAD A FEW HABITS BUT THESE WERE NOT OF A SORT THAT REQUIRED MUCH UPHOLSTERY
FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE SHE HAD HELD HER TONGUE
THIS HAD BEEN AS STRANGE AS IT HAD BEEN INSTINCTIVE AND THE STRANGENESS OF COURSE WAS WHAT MUST HAVE STRUCK MR RANSOM
THERE IS ONE STATEMENT I WILL VENTURE TO ADVANCE
THESE MEDITATIONS ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS MULTIFARIOUS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE STREETS AND THE SUBURBS OF THE NEW ENGLAND CAPITAL
SHE SANK INTO IT A LITTLE MORE EVERY DAY WITHOUT MEASURING THE INCHES OF HER DESCENT
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM NO SIGN OF PARDON OR PENITENCE IN ANY OF THE LITTLE WAYS THAT ARE FAMILIAR TO WOMEN--BY SENDING HIM A MESSAGE THROUGH HER SISTER OR EVEN A BOOK A PHOTOGRAPH A CHRISTMAS CARD OR A NEWSPAPER BY THE POST
SINCE THAT PARTY AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S SO IMPORTANT IN ITS RESULTS FOR OLIVE SHE HAD HAD OCCASION TO APPROACH MRS FARRINDER MORE NEARLY AND THOSE OVERTURES BROUGHT FORTH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GREAT LEADER OF THE FEMININE REVOLUTION WAS THE ONE PERSON IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD MORE CONCENTRATED MORE DETERMINED THAN HERSELF
THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE SEEMED TO WANT NOTHING BETTER THAN TO SIT BY OLIVE'S FIRE AND RAMBLE ON ABOUT THE OLD STRUGGLES WITH A VAGUE COMFORTABLE SENSE--NO PHYSICAL RAPTURE OF MISS BIRDSEYE'S COULD BE VERY ACUTE--OF IMMUNITY FROM WET FEET FROM THE DRAUGHTS THAT PREVAIL AT THIN MEETINGS OF INDEPENDENCE OF STREET-CARS THAT WOULD PROBABLY ARRIVE OVERFLOWING
IF MRS FARRINDER HAD LOOKED AT VERENA TARRANT AS IF SHE WERE A MOUNTEBANK THERE WAS SOME EXCUSE FOR IT INASMUCH AS THE GIRL MADE MUCH THE SAME IMPRESSION ON BASIL RANSOM
MISS CHANCELLOR ASKED HER WHY HER MOTHER SHOULD NOT GO WITH HER TO SEE THE CURIOSITIES SINCE SHE MENTIONED THAT THEIR POSSESSOR HAD NOT NEGLECTED TO INVITE MRS TARRANT
AT THAT HOUR OF THE DAY THE CAR WAS ALMOST EMPTY AND THEY HAD IT VIRTUALLY TO THEMSELVES
SHE WAS HAUNTED IN A WORD WITH THE FEAR THAT VERENA WOULD MARRY A FATE TO WHICH SHE WAS ALTOGETHER UNPREPARED TO SURRENDER HER
I THINK I OUGHT TO TELL YOU MISS CHANCELLOR WENT ON IN A MOMENT SHE WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST ONE OF THE MOST PASSIONATE OF THE OLD ABOLITIONISTS SHE HAD THOUGHT INDEED SHE OUGHT TO TELL HIM THAT AND IT THREW HER INTO A LITTLE TREMOR OF EXCITEMENT TO DO SO
IT ISN'T ME MOTHER VERENA REJOINED WITH SOFT GRAVITY RATHER DETACHED NOW FROM MRS FARRINDER AND SITTING WITH HER EYES FIXED THOUGHTFULLY ON THE GROUND
AND SHE HELD THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROTESTING AGAINST THE STATE OF BONDAGE OF WOMEN WAS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE SEX TO BECOME ILLUSTRIOUS
SHE ENJOYED PUTTING ON HER NEW HAT WITH ITS REDUNDANCY OF FEATHER AND TWENTY CENTS APPEARED TO HER A VERY LARGE SUM
BUT AT THIS MOMENT SHE HAD NOT THAT PROMISE OF SUCCESS WHICH RESIDES IN A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE USE OF EVERY AID THAT OFFERS
SHE HOPED VERY MUCH HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER--AS HE USED TO DO SIX MONTHS BEFORE--THE FOLLOWING EVENING
BUT BEFORE SHE QUITTED HER KINSMAN TO GET READY SHE OBSERVED TO HIM THAT SHE WAS SURE HE KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT
RANSOM'S DELAY WAS DIPLOMATIC BUT AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES HE RETURNED TO THE YOUNG LADIES IN BOSTON
A TABLE OR TWO WITH A DISCOLOURED MARBLE TOP A FEW BOOKS AND A COLLECTION OF NEWSPAPERS PILED UP IN CORNERS
THE AGE SEEMED TO HER RELAXED AND DEMORALISED AND I BELIEVE SHE LOOKED TO THE INFLUX OF THE GREAT FEMININE ELEMENT TO MAKE IT FEEL AND SPEAK MORE SHARPLY
BESIDES HE WASN'T HALF EDUCATED AND IT WAS HER BELIEF OR AT LEAST HER HOPE THAT AN EDUCATIVE PROCESS WAS NOW GOING ON FOR VERENA UNDER HER OWN DIRECTION WHICH WOULD ENABLE HER TO MAKE SUCH A DISCOVERY FOR HERSELF
THEY BELONGED TO MISS CHANCELLOR'S VERY PRIVATE LIFE
BUT OLIVE WAS SURE THAT VERENA'S PROPHETIC IMPULSE HAD NOT BEEN STIRRED BY THE CHATTER OF WOMEN MISS CHANCELLOR KNEW THAT SOUND AS WELL AS ANY ONE
DOES MISS CHANCELLOR LIKE HER AS MUCH AS EVER MERCY
HE HAD SPENT HIS MODEST FORTUNE UPON THE BLACKS
DURING THE FEW WEEKS PRECEDING THE MOMENT AT WHICH WE MEET HIM AGAIN HE HAD EVEN BEGUN TO LOSE FAITH ALTOGETHER IN HIS EARTHLY DESTINY
THAT WAS WHY HE WAS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT HIS OWN CHILD THAT WAY BEFORE A GATHERING OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
THEY THOUGHT EVERYTHING OF EACH OTHER--THAT WAS VERY PLAIN
A LITTLE VARIETY-ACTRESS WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE AND WITH WHOM HE HAD ESTABLISHED THE MOST CORDIAL RELATIONS WAS OFTEN HAVING HER SUPPER SHE TOOK IT SOMEWHERE EVERY NIGHT AFTER THE THEATRE IN THE DIM CLOSE DINING-ROOM AND HE USED TO DROP IN AND TALK TO HER
AT LEAST SUCH AN ATTITUDE ON HIS PART WAS TO BE INFERRED FROM HIS INCREASED SOLEMNITY
THE POSITION OF WOMEN IS TO MAKE FOOLS OF MEN
IF IT GAVE ONE TIME IF IT GAVE ONE LEISURE WAS NOT THAT IN ITSELF A HIGH MOTIVE
SHE MIGHT PRETEND STILL TO GO ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF UNPOPULAR CAUSES MIGHT FUMBLE FOR PAPERS IN HER IMMEMORIAL SATCHEL AND THINK SHE HAD IMPORTANT APPOINTMENTS MIGHT SIGN PETITIONS ATTEND CONVENTIONS SAY TO DOCTOR PRANCE THAT IF SHE WOULD ONLY MAKE HER SLEEP SHE SHOULD LIVE TO SEE A GREAT MANY IMPROVEMENTS YET
PRIESTS--WHEN THEY WERE REAL PRIESTS--NEVER MARRIED AND WHAT YOU AND I DREAM OF DOING DEMANDS OF US A KIND OF PRIESTHOOD
IT PROVED NOTHING OF ANY IMPORTANCE WITH REGARD TO MISS CHANCELLOR TO SAY THAT SHE WAS MORBID
BUT THE PASSIONATE QUAVER WITH WHICH A MOMENT LATER SHE ANSWERED HIM SUFFICIENTLY ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD TOUCHED HER AT A TENDER POINT
IT WAS SOME POWER OUTSIDE--IT SEEMED TO FLOW THROUGH HER
IT SEEMED TO HER STRANGE THAT VERENA SHOULD URGE HER TO TAKE SUCH A STEP WHEN SHE WAS FREE TO GO WITHOUT HER AND IT PROVED TWO THINGS
THEY SAT THERE AS IF THEY WERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING
HE WANTED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE GIRL WHO LIVED WITH OLIVE CHANCELLOR
THE LONG LOW BRIDGE THAT CRAWLED ON ITS STAGGERING POSTS ACROSS THE CHARLES
SUCH AN APPARITION WAS SO SCANTILY TO HIS PURPOSE
IT MUST COME FROM THE GROWTH OF YOUR PERCEPTION
GOOD-BYE MR RANSOM MRS LUNA CONTINUED GATHERING UP THE FEATHERY WHITE SHAWL WHICH ADDED TO THE VOLUME OF HER FAIRNESS
PERHAPS SHE COULD DIE AND COME TO LIFE AGAIN
IT HAD BECOME APPARENT THAT HER LONG AND BEAUTIFUL CAREER WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE HER EARNEST UNREMITTING WORK WAS OVER HER OLD-FASHIONED WEAPONS WERE BROKEN AND DULL
HE SAW THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE EMISSARIES WHO WOULD COME AFTER HIS DAUGHTER
THERE WERE SO MANY BRIGHT NEW MOTIVES AND IDEAS IN THE WORLD THAT THERE MIGHT EVEN BE REASONS FOR LOOKING AT HER
IT SEEMS AS IF SHE WERE GATHERING STRENGTH JUST TO BREAK OVER BOSTON LIKE A WAVE
BUT HER MOTHER LIKED TO THINK THAT SHE WAS QUICK AND GRACEFUL AND SHE QUESTIONED HER EXHAUSTIVELY AS TO THE PROGRESS OF THIS INTERESTING EPISODE
IT BECAME MUCH OF A QUESTION WITH HIM WHETHER SUCCESS IN ANY FORM WAS WRITTEN THERE
AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM HOWEVER HE WAS CHECKED BY A SUDDEN PAUSE ON THE PART OF THE TWO LADIES
HE BEGGED HER TO SIT DOWN AGAIN
SHE HAD TOLD HER FRIEND EVERYTHING NOW--EVERYTHING BUT ONE LITTLE SECRET NAMELY THAT IF SHE COULD HAVE CHOSEN AT THE BEGINNING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO RESEMBLE MRS LUNA
IT WAS NONE OF HIS BUSINESS WHETHER IN HER HEART SHE THOUGHT VERENA A PARROT OR A GENIUS
THE LITTLE MEDICAL LADY STRUCK HIM AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE YANKEE FEMALE"--THE FIGURE WHICH IN THE UNREGENERATE IMAGINATION OF THE CHILDREN OF THE COTTON-STATES WAS PRODUCED BY THE NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL-SYSTEM THE PURITAN CODE THE UNGENIAL CLIMATE THE ABSENCE OF CHIVALRY
BOOK SECOND XXI BASIL RANSOM LIVED IN NEW YORK RATHER FAR TO THE EASTWARD AND IN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TOWN
I NEED NOT REPRODUCE IT IN EXTENSO
THERE'S SOMETHING SO SEARCHING THAT THE FIRST TIME I VISITED HER IT QUITE REALISED MY IDEA OF THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT
MISS TARRANT IS OF THE BEST NEW ENGLAND STOCK--WHAT I CALL THE BEST I'M SURE FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE BOSTON LADIES NO MANIFESTATION OF GRACE CAN EXCITE MY SURPRISE RANSOM REJOINED LOOKING WITH HIS SMILE AT HIS COUSIN
SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE ELEVATION OF OUR SEX
I MUST HAVE UNFRIENDLY ELEMENTS--I LIKE TO WIN THEM OVER OLIVE THOUGHT OF BASIL RANSOM AND WONDERED WHETHER HE WOULD DO FOR AN UNFRIENDLY ELEMENT
HE TALKED SOME TIME TO OLIVE ABOUT MOUNT DESERT TOLD HER THAT IN HIS LETTERS HE HAD DESCRIBED THE COMPANY AT THE DIFFERENT HOTELS
I END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE BOSTONIANS VOL
AND WHEN MISS CHANCELLOR EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT MR RANSOM BECAUSE HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MEET MRS FARRINDER SHE GAVE THE YOUNG MAN A DELICATE DIRTY DEMOCRATIC LITTLE HAND LOOKING AT HIM KINDLY AS SHE COULD NOT HELP DOING BUT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST DISCRIMINATION AS AGAINST OTHERS WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH INVOLVED POSSIBLY AN INJUSTICE TO BE PRESENT ON SUCH AN INTERESTING OCCASION
AND WHILE SHE SPOKE THE PEACEFUL PICTURE HUNG BEFORE HER OF STILL WINTER EVENINGS UNDER THE LAMP WITH FALLING SNOW OUTSIDE AND TEA ON A LITTLE TABLE AND SUCCESSFUL RENDERINGS WITH A CHOSEN COMPANION OF GOETHE ALMOST THE ONLY FOREIGN AUTHOR SHE CARED ABOUT
BASIL RANSOM WAS CONSCIOUS OF ALL THIS AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS VAGUELY ENGAGED IN A SPECULATION
HE ONLY WISHED TO TALK OVER THE MATTER SOCIABLY WITH MISS CHANCELLOR
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SO FREE IN HER OWN DRAWING-ROOM AS THIS LOUD SOUTHERNER TO WHOM SHE HAD SO RASHLY OFFERED A FOOTING
HE WISHED TO BRING ABOUT THE DAY WHEN THEY WOULD FLOW IN FREELY
BUT FOR HIMSELF ALL HE COULD FEEL WAS THAT TO HIS STARVED SENSES SHE IRRESISTIBLY APPEALED
SHE WISHED TO HEAVEN THAT CONCEITED YOUNG MEN WITH TIME ON THEIR HANDS WOULD LEAVE VERENA ALONE
HE WAS USED TO QUICK OPERATIONS HOWEVER AND HE HAD ONLY A MOMENT OF BRIGHT BLANKNESS BEFORE REPLYING
MRS TARRANT WAS PROVIDED WITH ANOTHER SEAT AND VERENA RELINQUISHING HER FATHER'S GRASP PLACED HERSELF IN THE CHAIR WHICH TARRANT PUT IN POSITION FOR HER
THERE WAS A SPLENDID SKY ALL BLUE-BLACK AND SILVER--A SPARKLING WINTRY VAULT WHERE THE STARS WERE LIKE A MYRIAD POINTS OF ICE
IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING TOUCH IN THE WHOLE THING AND THE MOST VIVID PROOF OF HER INNOCENCE
MISS BIRDSEYE WAS INCAPABLE OF RESENTMENT
I HOPE YOU'VE GOT A WARM WRAP
OF COURSE HE KNEW THERE WERE MILLIONS OF LADY-READERS BUT HE INTIMATED THAT HE DIDN'T ADDRESS HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO THE GYNECAEUM
AS I SAY VERENA WAS PLEASED TO REGARD THE PHASE AS QUITE INEVITABLE AND SHE HAD SAID MORE THAN ONCE TO OLIVE THAT IF THEIR STRUGGLE WAS TO BE WITH MEN THE MORE THEY KNEW ABOUT THEM THE BETTER
UNDER THE PRETEXT OF KEEPING HIM AT ANY COST REFINED ADELINE HAD CODDLED AND CARESSED HIM HAVING HIM ALWAYS IN HER PETTICOATS REMITTING HIS LESSONS WHEN HE PRETENDED HE HAD AN EARACHE DRAWING HIM INTO THE CONVERSATION LETTING HIM ANSWER HER BACK WITH AN IMPERTINENCE BEYOND HIS YEARS WHEN SHE ADMINISTERED THE SMALLEST CHECK
THIS WAS THE ONLY REPROACH THAT MRS TARRANT DIRECTED TO THE NEW FRIEND AS YET
AND IF SHE WANTED SO MUCH TO BE A CONSERVATIVE SHE COULD TRY FIRST HOW SHE LIKED BEING A CONSERVATIVE'S WIFE
BUT SHE WAS OF IT ENOUGH TO GO OCCASIONALLY INTO OTHER HOUSES AND TO RECEIVE THEIR OCCUPANTS IN HER OWN
I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND HER AND SHE HAD BETTER NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN IN BOSTON
IF A MAN IS NICE WITHOUT IT IT'S SUCH A PLEASANT CHANGE THE YOUNG MAN STARTED THEN GAVE A NATURAL LAUGH
IF THEY WOULD ONLY BE PRIVATE AND PASSIVE AND HAVE NO FEELING BUT FOR THAT AND LEAVE PUBLICITY TO THE SEX OF TOUGHER HIDE
OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL--IT APPEALS TO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
THAT'S HER RESIDENCE--HER PRINCIPAL ONE--SINCE SHE BECAME SO UNITED TO YOUR COUSIN
BASIL RANSOM'S EMOTIONS WERE PECULIAR WHILE HIS HOSTESS DELIVERED HERSELF IN A MANNER AT ONCE CASUAL AND EMPHATIC OF THESE RATHER INSIDIOUS REMARKS
DO YOU CONSIDER THAT SHE BELONGS TO YOU OR THAT SHE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE
LET HER ACT OUT HER NATURE
THE NEWSPAPERS WERE HIS WORLD THE RICHEST EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES OF HUMAN LIFE
I DON'T REMEMBER ALL I WAS ONE OF THEM BASIL RANSOM SAID
SHE APPEARED TO HAVE MADE UP HER MIND AFTER HER FIRST HESITATION THAT THE TARRANT FAMILY WERE FANTASTICAL AND COMPROMISING
SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF COURSE OF NEGLECTING SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSTURE AS ONE WHO PAID WITH HER HEART'S BLOOD FOR LEADING THE VAN OF HUMAN PROGRESS
NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE RECEIVED HER REPROACHFUL LETTER AFTER IT HAD HAD TIME TO WORK A LITTLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN UNJUST AND EVEN BRUTAL AND AS HE WAS EASILY TOUCHED BY REMORSE OF THIS KIND HE TOOK UP THE BROKEN THREAD
PEOPLE CIRCULATED MORE FREELY AND VERENA TARRANT WAS PRESENTLY HIDDEN FROM RANSOM'S SIGHT BY THE CLOSE-PRESSED RANKS OF THE NEW FRIENDS SHE HAD MADE
I'D SIT IN A FOREST TO HEAR HER BRING SOME OF THEM OUT VERENA WENT ON WITH CHARACTERISTIC RACINESS
BUT THE GENTLEMAN SHE SPOKE OF DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO INVENT TO PLEASE HER
YOUR MOTHER SAW THAT I MEANT WHAT I SAID
IT HAD BEEN OLIVE'S ORIGINAL DESIRE TO OBTAIN MRS FARRINDER'S STAMP FOR HER PROTEGEE
SHE HAD IN PARTICULAR A WAY OF EXPLAINING CONFIDENTIALLY--AND IN HER DESIRE TO BE GRAPHIC SHE OFTEN MADE UP THE ODDEST FACES--THE INTERPRETATION THAT YOU MUST SOMETIMES GIVE TO THE MANNERS OF THE BEST PEOPLE AND THE DELICATE DIGNITY WITH WHICH YOU SHOULD MEET THEM WHICH MADE VERENA WONDER WHAT SECRET SOURCES OF INFORMATION SHE POSSESSED
BASIL RANSOM KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT SUCH A LIFE AS HERS BUT SHE SEEMED TO HIM A REVELATION OF A CLASS AND A MULTITUDE OF SOCIALISTIC FIGURES OF NAMES AND EPISODES THAT HE HAD HEARD OF GROUPED THEMSELVES BEHIND HER
BESIDES YOU ARE ON THE TOP AS WELL
SHE TALKED WITH GREAT SLOWNESS AND DISTINCTNESS AND EVIDENTLY A HIGH SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
DON'T YOU CARE FOR HUMAN PROGRESS MISS CHANCELLOR WENT ON
SHE CAN FIND OUT SOME THINGS IF SHE TRIES
EVEN IN THE PRIVACY OF DOMESTIC INTERCOURSE HE HAD PHRASES EXCUSES EXPLANATIONS WAYS OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH AS SHE FELT WERE TOO SUBLIME FOR JUST HERSELF
SHE KNEW TWO OR THREE OF THE GENTLEMEN
IT WAS TOO MUCH TO SAY OF HER THAT SHE FORGAVE INJURIES SINCE SHE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF THEM
SHE HAD FAR MORE COLOUR THAN ANY ONE THERE FOR WHATEVER BRIGHTNESS WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISS BIRDSEYE'S RATHER FADED AND DINGY HUMAN COLLECTION HAD GATHERED ITSELF INTO THIS ATTRACTIVE BUT AMBIGUOUS YOUNG PERSON
HER ONLY GREAT ADVANTAGE IN SHORT HAD BEEN THE PARENTAL EXAMPLE
THE CRUELTY--THE CRUELTY
POLITENESS EVEN A LARGELY-INTERPRETED CHIVALRY REQUIRED NOTHING MORE THAN HE HAD ALREADY DONE
READERS PERHAPS WOULD COME IF CLIENTS DIDN'T
NOT IMMEDIATELY OF COURSE FOR THE YOUNG MAN MINGLED WITH HIS SOUTHERN PRIDE A SHYNESS WHICH OFTEN SERVED ALL THE PURPOSE OF HUMILITY
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO TELL ME WHAT A LADY CAN DO AND SHE EDGED AWAY FROM HIM SOFTLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN TRAVERSING A HOSPITAL-WARD AND PRESENTLY HE SAW HER REACH THE DOOR WHICH WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE LATER COMERS HAD REMAINED OPEN
RANSOM WAS NEAR THE PAIR AND HAD THE BENEFIT OF MR PARDON'S ANSWER
AND THAT IN SUCH A CASE A FEW SHADES MORE OR LESS OF THE INEXPLICABLE DIDN'T MATTER
THAT WAS A BRANCH OF THE QUESTION ON WHICH IT MIGHT BE THE LEADERS HAD NOT INFORMATION ENOUGH
VERENA ASSENTED TO THIS AND SAID IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN WHAT EFFECT THEY HAD HAD UPON MR BURRAGE--A REMARK WHICH LED OLIVE TO FEAR THAT AT SUCH A RATE MUCH WOULD REMAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN VERENA TOLD HER LATER THAT ANOTHER VISIT TO THE YOUNG MAN'S ROOMS WAS PROJECTED AND THAT THIS TIME SHE MUST COME HE HAVING EXPRESSED THE GREATEST DESIRE FOR THE HONOUR AND HER OWN WISH BEING GREATER STILL THAT THEY SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF HIS BEAUTIFUL THINGS TOGETHER
SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY OVERDRAW THE GENERAL FEMININE ACCOUNT
THEN SHE EXCLAIMED BASIL RANSOM ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH THAT CREATURE HE GAVE A PERFECTLY NATURAL LAUGH NOT PLEADING GUILTY IN ORDER TO PRACTISE ON MRS LUNA BUT EXPRESSING THE SIMPLE STATE OF THE CASE
HE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN IN MANY HOUSES IN NEW YORK AND HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY ACCESSORIES
SHE APPLIED THIS TERM TO ANY EPISODICAL REPAST AT ANY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
A CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A LARGE HAT-TREE FROM WHICH SEVERAL COATS AND SHAWLS ALREADY DEPENDED
THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS THAT SHE HADN'T YET LEARNED TO DISLIKE IN SPITE OF HER FRIEND'S EARNEST EFFORTS TO TEACH HER
MR GRACIE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAD HER ON THAT SHE SHOULD JUSTIFY HIS DESCRIPTION AND PROVE THE RACIEST OF HER CLASS
THEY BELIEVED IN THE INFLUENCE OF THE LIPS
JUST AS MUCH AS FOR THE OLD WOMEN SAID MRS FARRINDER GENIALLY
IT CAME TO SEEM TO HIM VERY SOON THAT HE WAS NOT EARNING HIS FEE
SHE WAS SO ESSENTIALLY A CELIBATE THAT RANSOM FOUND HIMSELF THINKING OF HER AS OLD THOUGH WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK AT HER AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT WAS APPARENT THAT HER YEARS WERE FEWER THAN HIS OWN
BUT THE HAPPY THING IN HER COMPOSITION WAS THAT AFTER A SHORT CONTACT WITH THE DIVINE IDEA--OLIVE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO FLASH IT AT HER LIKE A JEWEL IN AN UNCOVERED CASE--SHE KINDLED FLAMED UP TOOK THE WORDS FROM HER FRIEND'S LESS PERSUASIVE LIPS RESOLVED HERSELF INTO A MAGICAL VOICE BECAME AGAIN THE PURE YOUNG SIBYL
FANCY YOUR WANTING TO PACK ME OFF TO BOSTON HIS HOSTESS WENT ON
MANY THINGS WERE STRANGE TO BASIL RANSOM
THE AIR IN ITS WINDLESS CHILL SEEMED TO TINKLE LIKE A CRYSTAL THE FAINTEST GRADATIONS OF TONE WERE PERCEPTIBLE IN THE SKY THE WEST BECAME DEEP AND DELICATE EVERYTHING GREW DOUBLY DISTINCT BEFORE TAKING ON THE DIMNESS OF EVENING
IT WOULD BE A SAD DAY FOR YOU AND FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF US IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
LOOK OUT FOR TANTRUMS THEN
THE UNDERSTANDING WITH VERENA WAS OF COURSE COMPLETE
THIS KNOWLEDGE OF HIS SECRET HERESY SEEMED TO HIM TO BE ALSO IN THE FACES OF THE OTHER LADIES WHOSE CIRCUMSPECT GLANCES HOWEVER FOR HE HAD NOT BEEN INTRODUCED TREATED IT AS A PITY RATHER THAN AS A SHAME
HE EVIDENTLY HAD NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS OPPORTUNITY
AND THE GOOD LADY WONDERED WHETHER SHE WERE ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN INDUCED TO COME UP
VERENA SUBSEQUENTLY OF COURSE HAD MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT SHE DILATED EVEN MORE UPON HER MOTHER'S IMPRESSIONS THAN UPON HER OWN
THERE WAS RICHNESS TO OUR PANTING YOUNG MAN IN THE SMALLEST OF THESE FIGURES
THE BREVITY OF THIS SIMPLE GARMENT WAS THE ONE DEVICE BY WHICH MISS BIRDSEYE MANAGED TO SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE FREE FOR ACTION
THE PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST COME IN WERE DOCTOR AND MRS TARRANT AND THEIR DAUGHTER VERENA
A STRONG ODOUR OF SMOKED FISH COMBINED WITH A FRAGRANCE OF MOLASSES HUNG ABOUT THE SPOT
FOR HER MOTHER ALWAYS CHOSE THE POSITIVE COURSE
HOW MUCH CAN WE COUNT UPON THEM
I DON'T THINK OF THEM AND IT'S NOT THEM I WANT
OLIVE HAD PORED OVER IT SO LONG SO EARNESTLY THAT SHE WAS NOW IN COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE SUBJECT
SHE HAD NEITHER A PARTICLE OF DIFFIDENCE NOR A PARTICLE OF VANITY
HERE AMID THE PILED-UP LUGGAGE THE CONVENIENT SPITTOONS THE ELBOWING LOUNGERS THE DISCONSOLATE GUESTS THE TRUCULENT IRISH PORTERS THE ROWS OF SHAGGY-BACKED MEN IN STRANGE HATS WRITING LETTERS AT A TABLE INLAID WITH ADVERTISEMENTS SELAH TARRANT MADE INNUMERABLE CONTEMPLATIVE STATIONS
IF HE CAME AT ANY RATE HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO COME SHORTLY BEFORE DINNER AT THE SAME HOUR AS YESTERDAY
YES THAT'S THE GREAT THING SELAH SAID
SHE WAS ALSO SUFFICIENTLY MINDFUL OF THAT
HE WONDERED HE COULDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS ONE OF HER KIND
FOR THE NECESSITY OF HER NATURE WAS NOT TO MAKE CONVERTS TO A RIDICULOUS CAUSE BUT TO EMIT THOSE CHARMING NOTES OF HER VOICE TO STAND IN THOSE FREE YOUNG ATTITUDES TO SHAKE HER BRAIDED LOCKS LIKE A NAIAD RISING FROM THE WAVES TO PLEASE EVERY ONE WHO CAME NEAR HER AND TO BE HAPPY THAT SHE PLEASED
HIS PROPHECY WAS VERIFIED AND VERENA DID COME OUT AFTER A LITTLE
BUT FOR US SUGGESTED MISS BIRDSEYE
IT WAS GIVEN TO OLIVE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR HALF AN HOUR TO SURRENDER HERSELF TO ENJOY THE MUSIC TO ADMIT THAT MR BURRAGE PLAYED WITH EXQUISITE TASTE TO FEEL AS IF THE SITUATION WERE A KIND OF TRUCE
SO IT WOULD BE EASY AFTER ALL TO MAKE OLIVE THAT PROMISE AND IT WOULD GIVE HER SO MUCH PLEASURE
I DON'T WANT THE GENTLEMEN-DOCTORS TO GET AHEAD OF ME OH NO ONE WILL EVER GET AHEAD OF YOU I'M VERY SURE
HE SAW HE WAS GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND BEFORE HE COULD SUPPRESS IT AN EXCLAMATION BURST FROM HIS LIPS--THE FIRST EXCLAMATION HE COULD THINK OF THAT WOULD PERHAPS CHECK HIS COUSIN'S RETREAT
HE THOUGHT IT VERY QUEER AND WONDERED WHAT DOCTOR PRANCE WOULD HAVE SAID
HE WAS A GREAT DEAL THOUGHT OF IN MAGAZINE CIRCLES
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IN BOSTON BEING VERY THOUGHTFUL MRS LUNA SAID GIVING YOU THE BACK BAY DON'T YOU HATE THE NAME TO LOOK AT AND THEN TAKING CREDIT FOR IT THIS HOWEVER WAS IN THE FUTURE
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER THAT MISS BIRDSEYE EVER NOTICED ANYTHING OF THAT SORT
IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR HER TO JUSTIFY HER REPUTATION OF AN ELEGANT MANNER AND IT MUST BE IMPARTIALLY RELATED THAT SHE STRUCK RANSOM AS HAVING A DIGNITY IN CONVERSATION AND A COMMAND OF THE NOBLE STYLE WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPASSED BY A DAUGHTER--ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED MOST FAR-DESCENDED DAUGHTERS--OF HIS OWN LATITUDE
SHE WAS CIVIL ENOUGH TO EVERY ONE BUT NOT IN ANY CASE ENDEARING AND PERFECTLY GENIAL WITHOUT BEING CONFIDING AS PEOPLE WERE IN BOSTON WHEN IN MOMENTS OF EXALTATION THEY WISHED TO MARK THAT THEY WERE NOT SUSPICIOUS
HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT EUROPE BUT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT WAS A GREAT PLACE FOR FACILITIES
I KNOW NOT WHETHER RANSOM WAS AWARE OF THE BEARINGS OF THIS INTERPRETATION WHICH ATTRIBUTED TO MISS TARRANT A SINGULAR HOLLOWNESS OF CHARACTER
I ONLY WANT YOUR CONFIDENCE--ONLY WHAT SPRINGS FROM THAT
SHE HAD SEEN BEFORE HOW SHE COULD BE PASSIONATELY SERIOUS AT TIMES AND THEN PERVERSELY EVEN IF INNOCENTLY TRIVIAL--AS JUST NOW WHEN SHE SEEMED TO WISH TO CONVERT ONE OF THEIR MOST SACRED FORMULAS INTO A PLEASANTRY
BUT HE LOST HIMSELF IN THIS CONSIDERATION OR AT ANY RATE SAID NOTHING FOR SOME TIME WHILE HIS EYES WANDERED OVER MRS LUNA AND HE PROBABLY WONDERED WHAT BODY OF DOCTRINE SHE REPRESENTED LITTLE AS SHE MIGHT PARTAKE OF THE NATURE OF HER SISTER
EVEN AFTER HER SISTER HAD PASSED OUT OF THE ROOM SHE SAT THERE WITH HER EYES TURNED AWAY AS IF THERE HAD BEEN A SPELL UPON HER WHICH FORBADE HER TO RAISE THEM
HE DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY WERE WAITING TILL SHE WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD
THEY LOOK AS IF THEIR BLOOD HAD GONE INTO IT
HE GREW MORE IMPATIENT AT LAST NOT OF THE DELAY OF THE EDIFYING VOICE THOUGH SOME TIME HAD ELAPSED BUT OF TARRANT'S GROTESQUE MANIPULATIONS WHICH HE RESENTED AS MUCH AS IF HE HIMSELF HAD FELT THEIR TOUCH AND WHICH SEEMED A DISHONOUR TO THE PASSIVE MAIDEN
HE WENT HOWEVER THROUGH NONE OF THE FORMS OF REASSURANCE BEYOND REMARKING YOU WANT TO GET RIGHT IN HERE--QUICK BUT STOOD WITH HIS HAND RAISED IN A THREATENING WAY TO THE CORD OF HIS SIGNAL-BELL
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HOWEVER HE HAD COME TO DESIRE TO DO THIS ALMOST AS LITTLE AS TO MARRY MRS LUNA
SHE SUPPOSED BASIL WOULD THINK HER VERY UPLIFTED
BASIL RANSOM MEANWHILE PUT THE QUESTION TO MRS LUNA
WHEREVER YOU GO MADAM IT WILL MATTER LITTLE WHAT YOU CARRY
IT WAS ABOUT THEIR DAY HAVING COME AT LAST ABOUT THE UNIVERSAL SISTERHOOD ABOUT THEIR DUTY TO THEMSELVES AND TO EACH OTHER
VERENA WAS FOND OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE
CEDRON MARY MEEHAN AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET THE BOSTONIANS A NOVEL BY HENRY JAMES IN TWO VOLUMES VOL
MRS FARRINDER GLANCED AT HER ASKANCE AND THEN SAID TO RANSOM SERENELY
HE HAD SEEN TARRANT OR HIS EQUIVALENT OFTEN BEFORE
BUT THE WORDS RATHER IRRITATED MISS CHANCELLOR WHO AS WE KNOW DID NOT CARE TO ALLOW FOR ACCIDENTAL EXCEPTIONS IN THE GREAT MASCULINE CONSPIRACY
IT IS A CURIOUS PROOF OF A CERTAIN CRUDE MODESTY INHERENT IN BASIL RANSOM THAT THE MAIN EFFECT OF HIS OBSERVING HIS COUSIN'S GERMAN BOOKS WAS TO GIVE HIM AN IDEA OF THE NATURAL ENERGY OF NORTHERNERS
HE HAD NEVER YET EVEN IN JOKE MADE SO CRUDE SO RUDE A SPEECH TO A LADY
IT MAY BE SAID THAT HE HAD A HIGHER CONCEPTION OF POLITENESS THAN MOST OF THE PERSONS WHO DESIRED THE ADVENT OF FEMALE LAW-MAKERS
THOUGH SHE HAD A CONSCIOUSNESS OF SITTING DOWN SOMEWHERE--THE OBJECT CREAKED AND ROCKED BENEATH HER--AND OF THE TABLE AT TEA BEING COVERED WITH A CLOTH STAMPED IN BRIGHT COLOURS
SINCE THEN HE HAD ASCENDED OTHER STEPS OF THE SAME LADDER
BUT MARK MY WORDS SAID MRS LUNA SHE WILL GIVE OLIVE THE GREATEST CUT SHE HAS EVER HAD IN HER LIFE
THAT IS EXACTLY LIKE OLIVE
SHE ONLY LOOKED AT HIM WITH A FACE IN WHICH SHE INTENDED TO EXPRESS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT NEED DETAIN HIM LONGER
WELL SHE SUPPOSED HE WAS VERY BRIGHT
I SUPPOSE THEY RETAIN MORE THAN ONE MIGHT THINK
THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO IN THE END
VERENA GAVE A LAUGH OF CLEAR AMUSEMENT WITHOUT A SHADE OF EMBARRASSMENT OR CONFUSION
BASIL RANSOM WONDERED WHO THEY ALL WERE
IT WAS A CURIOUS INCIDENT OF HER ZEAL FOR THE REGENERATION OF HER SEX THAT MANLY THINGS WERE PERHAPS ON THE WHOLE WHAT SHE UNDERSTOOD BEST
LIKED TO SHOOT UPWARD WITHOUT AN EFFORT OF HER OWN AND LOOK DOWN UPON ALL CREATION UPON ALL HISTORY FROM SUCH A HEIGHT
AND INDEED HE WAS VERY LONG BASIL RANSOM AND HE EVEN LOOKED A LITTLE HARD AND DISCOURAGING LIKE A COLUMN OF FIGURES IN SPITE OF THE FRIENDLY FACE WHICH HE BENT UPON HIS HOSTESS'S DEPUTY AND WHICH IN ITS THINNESS HAD A DEEP DRY LINE A SORT OF PREMATURE WRINKLE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MOUTH
FAIL YOU
OF COURSE THEY WERE NATURALLY MORE CHATTY AND THAT WAS THE STYLE OF LITERATURE THAT SEEMED TO TAKE MOST TO-DAY
IT AIN'T SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME--THE BEST YOU CAN HAVE THIS LITTLE LADY WAS TOUGH AND TECHNICAL
THEY GREETED THESE SALLIES WITH A MERRIMENT OF WHICH THOUGH IT WAS COURTEOUS IN FORM OLIVE WAS BY NO MEANS UNABLE TO DEFINE THE SPIRIT
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY ONE LIKE US
FROM THE WINDOW OF THE DINING-ROOM AT THAT MOMENT THEY HEARD THE CARRIAGE DRIVE UP
AND AT CERTAIN TIMES LISTENING TO THE ANSWERS SHE MADE TO HER QUESTIONS OLIVE CHANCELLOR CLOSED HER EYES IN THE MANNER OF A PERSON WAITING TILL GIDDINESS PASSED
THE TWO YOUNG MEN WERE IN THE BEST HUMOUR
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE GAVE HIM AN UNEASY FEELING--THE SENSE THAT YOU COULD NEVER BE SAFE WITH A PERSON WHO TOOK THINGS SO HARD
I ADMIRE YOU SO MUCH
I FORGOT IT THE OTHER NIGHT BUT I HAVE REMEMBERED IT SINCE
I SCARCELY KNOW WHOM TO LISTEN TO MOST
SHE HAD AN IMMENSE DESIRE TO KNOW INTIMATELY SOME VERY POOR GIRL
WHEN I LOOK AROUND ME AT THE WORLD AND AT THE STATE THAT MEN HAVE BROUGHT IT TO I CONFESS I SAY TO MYSELF WELL IF WOMEN HAD FIXED IT THIS WAY I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD THINK OF IT WHEN I SEE THE DREADFUL MISERY OF MANKIND AND THINK OF THE SUFFERING OF WHICH AT ANY HOUR AT ANY MOMENT THE WORLD IS FULL I SAY THAT IF THIS IS THE BEST THEY CAN DO BY THEMSELVES THEY HAD BETTER LET US COME IN A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT HE HIMSELF WAS IN LOVE WITH VERENA BUT HIS PASSION WAS NOT A JEALOUS ONE AND INCLUDED A REMARKABLE DISPOSITION TO SHARE THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HOW LITTLE HE AMOUNTED TO OLIVE PERCEIVED AFTER SHE HAD MADE VERENA TALK AS THE GIRL DID IMMENSELY ABOUT HER FATHER AND MOTHER--QUITE UNCONSCIOUS MEANWHILE OF THE CONCLUSIONS SHE SUGGESTED TO MISS CHANCELLOR
OLIVE CHANCELLOR MENTIONED THAT IS SHE MAKING A SPEECH THERE NO
SHE READ QUICKLY AND REMEMBERED INFALLIBLY
AND AT THAT MOMENT MISS CHANCELLOR RE-ENTERED THE ROOM
THE SOONER SHE GOT THROUGH IT THE BETTER WAS IT NOT?--AND SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT HER TRANSIT WOULD BE MATERIALLY QUICKENED BY A VISIT TO MR BURRAGE'S ROOMS
IT WAS CERTAIN THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BECOME OF THE MOVEMENT AT LARGE DOCTOR PRANCE'S OWN LITTLE REVOLUTION WAS A SUCCESS
OF COURSE HE HADN'T COME THERE TO CROSS-QUESTION HER
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS POOR LADY HAD GROWN DREADFULLY LIMP
SHE WOULD HAVE SAID AT ANY TIME IF SHE HAD BEEN ASKED THAT SHE DIDN'T SUPPOSE MISS CHANCELLOR WOULD WANT HER TO MARRY
OLIVE HAD OFTEN DECLARED BEFORE THAT HER CONCEPTION OF LIFE WAS AS SOMETHING SUBLIME OR AS NOTHING AT ALL
NOTHING TO OLIVE'S SENSE BUT A SMELL OF KEROSENE
THE CONVICTIONS HE HAD ARRIVED AT WERE NOT SUCH AS MIX GRACEFULLY WITH THE TIME-HONOURED VERITIES A YOUNG LAWYER LOOKING OUT FOR BUSINESS IS IN THE HABIT OF TAKING FOR GRANTED
MR GRACIE SEEMED INCLINED TO MAKE THE STURDIEST PROTEST
BUT DON'T YOU SEE HOW THIS LITTLE REUNION WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO FIX IT SHE LINGERED AN INSTANT WITH HER ANXIOUS FACE
WELL I NEVER HEARD IT PUT THAT WAY RANSOM HEARD ONE OF THE LADIES EXCLAIM
THE VALUE OF HER PERFORMANCE WAS YET TO BE PROVED BUT SHE WAS CERTAINLY VERY PALE WHITE AS WOMEN ARE WHO HAVE THAT SHADE OF RED HAIR
SHE IS THE YOUNGEST SPIRIT I KNOW
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD CHANCE TO TRY WITHOUT FATHER YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU AIN'T GOING TO BE SUPPORTED MRS TARRANT EXCLAIMED WITH DISMAY
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MR BURRAGE
DOCTOR PRANCE WAS LOOKING AT HER--AT MISS BIRDSEYE--WITH LITTLE SHARP FIXED PUPILS
WHAT SHE DID SAY WAS THAT EVIDENTLY MRS FARRINDER WANTED TO KEEP THE MOVEMENT IN HER OWN HANDS--VIEWED WITH SUSPICION CERTAIN ROMANTIC ESTHETIC ELEMENTS WHICH OLIVE AND VERENA SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO INTRODUCE INTO IT
THERE WAS A WANT OF BOLD ACTION
HER SISTER COULD HAVE HATED HER FOR IT IF SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HERSELF THIS EMOTION AS DIRECTED TO INDIVIDUALS
MISS CHANCELLOR HAVING THE GOOD FORTUNE TO DWELL ON THAT SIDE OF CHARLES STREET TOWARD WHICH IN THE REAR THE AFTERNOON SUN SLANTS REDLY FROM AN HORIZON INDENTED AT EMPTY INTERVALS WITH WOODEN SPIRES THE MASTS OF LONELY BOATS THE CHIMNEYS OF DIRTY WORKS OVER A BRACKISH EXPANSE OF ANOMALOUS CHARACTER WHICH IS TOO BIG FOR A RIVER AND TOO SMALL FOR A BAY
YES THAT WILL BE A GOOD THING
THEY CALL IT INSPIRATIONAL
IT MAY THEREFORE BE IMAGINED HOW SHARP HER VISION WOULD HAVE BEEN COULD SHE ONLY HAVE TAKEN THE SITUATION MORE SIMPLY
MISS TARRANT WON'T BE SURPRISED IF I RECOGNISE HER--IF I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO SPEAK TO HER
SHE HAD GENIUS THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF THAT AND SHE WOULD TAKE A NEW LINE ALTOGETHER
THEY INSISTED SO MUCH FOR INSTANCE ON THE HISTORIC UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
AND SHE PASSED TO THE DOOR WITH MISS BIRDSEYE BIDDING GOOD-BYE TO NO ONE
I DEAL WITH FACTS--HARD FACTS MRS FARRINDER REPLIED
IT WILL BE SOME MOMENTS BEFORE IT GETS HERE
IT INVOLVED AMONG OTHER THINGS A PERPETUAL PERAMBULATION OF THE STREETS A HAUNTING OF HORSE-CARS RAILWAY-STATIONS SHOPS THAT WERE SELLING OFF BUT THE PLACES THAT KNEW HIM BEST WERE THE OFFICES OF THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE VESTIBULES OF THE HOTELS--THE BIG MARBLE-PAVED CHAMBERS OF INFORMAL REUNION WHICH OFFER TO THE STREETS THROUGH HIGH GLASS PLATES THE SIGHT OF THE AMERICAN CITIZEN SUSPENDED BY HIS HEELS
I AM ACQUAINTED WITH THE LOYALTY OF ST LOUIS WELL AFTER THAT YOU MUST LET ME INTRODUCE MISS TARRANT
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE CONVERTED--ALREADY CONVERTED TO MISS TARRANT DECIDEDLY YOU ARE NOT TO BELONG TO ANY MISS TARRANT
SHE HAD SEEN HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AT MISS BIRDSEYE'S AND SHE SAID TO HER HOSTESS NOW I MUST GO--YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER CALLER IT WAS VERENA'S BELIEF THAT IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD LIKE MRS FARRINDER SHE THOUGHT MISS CHANCELLOR BELONGED TO IT--THOUGHT THAT IN STANDING THERE SHE HERSELF WAS IN IT)--IN THE HIGHEST SOCIAL WALKS IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF A PRIOR GUEST TO DEPART WHEN ANOTHER FRIEND ARRIVED
THERE WAS A SIMPLICITY IN HIM WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO WONDER WHETHER SHE HAD NOT IMPROVED
I WILL GIVE UP--I WILL GIVE UP EVERYTHING FILLED WITH THE IMPRESSION OF HER HOSTESS'S AGREEABLE INTERIOR AND OF WHAT HER MOTHER HAD TOLD HER ABOUT MISS CHANCELLOR'S WEALTH HER POSITION IN BOSTON SOCIETY VERENA IN HER FRESH DIVERTED SCRUTINY OF THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS WONDERED WHAT COULD BE THE NEED OF THIS SCHEME OF RENUNCIATION
THE SUDDEN UNEASINESS THAT HE FLUNG OVER HER IN THE CARRIAGE HAD NOT LEFT HER THOUGH SHE FELT IT LESS NOW SHE WAS WITH OTHERS AND ESPECIALLY THAT SHE WAS CLOSE TO MRS FARRINDER WHO WAS SUCH A FOUNTAIN OF STRENGTH
EACH THOUGHT THE OTHER SO NOBLE AND MRS TARRANT HAD A FAITH THAT BETWEEN THEM THEY WOULD ROUSE THE PEOPLE
BUT HE NEVER SUSPECTED THAT SHE CULTIVATED THESE TOPICS HER TREATMENT OF THEM STRUCK HIM AS HIGHLY COMICAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEADING HIM TO THE ALTAR OF BEGUILING THE WAY
RANSOM WAS DISAPPOINTED
YOU SEE WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS THIS
SUCH A VISION AS THIS WAS THE HIGHEST INDULGENCE SHE COULD OFFER HERSELF
AS FOR NEWTON HE WOULD BE MORE UTTERLY ODIOUS IF POSSIBLE AS HE GREW UP THAN HE WAS ALREADY
SUCH CHANCES WERE AGITATING
SHE GREETED THE CHARMING SUPPLIANT WITH THE FROWN OF JUNO
HER FATHER SAYS IT'S A NATURAL GIFT RANSOM SAW THAT HE SHOULD NOT IN THE LEAST DISCOVER MRS FARRINDER'S REAL OPINION AND HER DISSIMULATION ADDED TO HIS IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A POLICY
WHO WAS THAT CELEBRITY THAT WAS MENTIONED LAST NIGHT?--ELIZA P
SHE WAS A COPIOUS HANDSOME WOMAN IN WHOM ANGULARITY HAD BEEN CORRECTED BY THE AIR OF SUCCESS
XXIII THREE WEEKS AFTERWARD HE STOOD IN FRONT OF OLIVE CHANCELLOR'S HOUSE LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND HESITATING
AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES RANSOM BECAME AWARE THAT THE WHOLE AUDIENCE--MRS FARRINDER MISS CHANCELLOR AND THE TOUGH SUBJECT FROM MISSISSIPPI--WERE UNDER THE CHARM
HER PARENTAGE WAS AN IMPLICATION OF THAT
BUT SHE SEEMS TO SHOW ALL THAT'S IN HERSELF AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN YOU SEE HOW LOVELY IT IS
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FANCIED JUST FROM LOOKING AT THE GROUP THAT VERENA'S VOCATION WAS TO SMILE AND TALK WITH YOUNG MEN WHO BENT TOWARDS HER
AS THEY SAT THERE OLIVE WONDERED WHETHER VERENA HAD KEPT SOMETHING FROM HER WHETHER SHE WERE AFTER ALL LIKE SO MANY OTHER GIRLS IN CAMBRIDGE A COLLEGE-"BELLE AN OBJECT OF FREQUENTATION TO UNDERGRADUATES
ARE YOU GOING TO LET TEN YEARS ELAPSE AGAIN BEFORE YOU COME SHE ASKED AS BASIL RANSOM BADE HER GOOD-NIGHT
THEN SHE ADDED WELL I PRESUME WE CAN'T HAVE THE SYMPATHY OF ALL DOESN'T IT LOOK AS IF YOU HAD MY SYMPATHY WHEN I GET INTO A CAR ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU HOME--ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL AGITATORS RANSOM INQUIRED LAUGHING
SHE HAS AFFECTED SO MANY
MRS TARRANT NOW ENJOYED THE MINISTRATIONS OF A GIRL
IT SEEMS AS IF WE HAD ONLY A LITTLE WAY TO GO FURTHER THAT WORTHY OBSERVED AS HE ERECTED HIMSELF FOR DEPARTURE
BUT RANSOM THOUGHT THAT IF IT HAD BEEN MUCH WORSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AS GOOD FOR THE ARGUMENT THE DOCTRINE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
THIS WAS WHAT OLIVE CHANCELLOR HAD COME TO HEAR
BUT THE POOR GIRL MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED FURTHER THAT TO SEE IT TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT SHE WAS UNADAPTED FOR SUCH COMPANY COULD SCARCELY BE MORE AGREEABLE TO OLIVE THAN TO BE DRAGGED INTO IT
HE COULD NOT GUESS THAT HE ANSWERED TO A CERTAIN SECRET IDEAL OF MRS LUNA'S WHO LOVED THE LANDED GENTRY EVEN WHEN LANDLESS WHO ADORED A SOUTHERNER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHO THOUGHT HER KINSMAN A FINE MANLY MELANCHOLY DISINTERESTED TYPE AND WHO WAS SURE THAT HER VIEWS OF PUBLIC MATTERS THE QUESTIONS OF THE AGE THE VULGAR CHARACTER OF MODERN LIFE WOULD MEET WITH A PERFECT RESPONSE IN HIS MIND
IN SHORT SHE HAD AN INTERVAL OF UNEXPECTED REST DURING WHICH SHE KEPT HER EYES MAINLY ON VERENA WHO SAT NEAR MRS BURRAGE LETTING HERSELF GO EVIDENTLY MORE COMPLETELY THAN OLIVE
HE CAN TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU MEAN EVERYTHING YOU DON'T
THEN HE WAS NO WORSE OFF THAN OTHERS
HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF GIVING IT UP AND RETURNING TO THE HOME OF HIS ANCESTORS WHERE AS HE HEARD FROM HIS MOTHER THERE WAS STILL JUST A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF HOT CORN-CAKE TO SUPPORT EXISTENCE
MRS FARRINDER HAD STARTED ON HER ANNUAL GRAND TOUR
THOU SHALT RENOUNCE REFRAIN ABSTAIN THAT'S THE WAY BAYARD TAYLOR HAS TRANSLATED THEM OLIVE ANSWERED
AND AT ANY RATE ANY CHARM SHE MIGHT HAVE EXHIBITED THEN HAD PROBABLY BEEN OBLITERATED BY THE COARSENING EFFECT OF PUBLICITY AND THE TONIC INFLUENCE OF HIS KINSWOMAN
AND PRESENTLY BASIL RANSOM FELT THAT HE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER HE WERE INTRODUCED OR NOT FOR THE GREATNESS OF AN EVIL DIDN'T MATTER IF THE REMEDY WERE EQUALLY GREAT
SHE HEARD THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE CLOSE AND SAW THE TWO CROSS THE STREET TOGETHER
WHEN MISS CHANCELLOR ASKED IF SHE RESPECTED MR BURRAGE AND HOW SOLEMN OLIVE COULD MAKE THAT WORD SHE BY THIS TIME KNEW SHE ANSWERED WITH HER SWEET VAIN LAUGH BUT APPARENTLY WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHETHER SHE DID OR NOT FOR WHAT WAS THE WHOLE THING BUT SIMPLY A PHASE--THE VERY ONE THEY HAD TALKED ABOUT
SHE BEGAN INCOHERENTLY ALMOST INAUDIBLY AS IF SHE WERE TALKING IN A DREAM
WHAT WAS THE USE OF HER HAVING THAT SHARP INSPIRED VISION OF THE HISTORY OF THE SEX IT WAS AS SHE HAD SAID HERSELF EXACTLY LIKE JOAN OF ARC'S ABSOLUTELY SUPERNATURAL APPREHENSION OF THE STATE OF FRANCE IF SHE WASN'T GOING TO CARRY IT OUT IF SHE WAS GOING TO BEHAVE AS THE ORDINARY PUSILLANIMOUS CONVENTIONAL YOUNG LADY
THEY COULD JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER THE WHOLE THING WAS NOT QUITE UNIQUE
SHE BELIEVED HE WAS VERY BRIGHT--BUT SHE HADN'T READ ANYTHING
THE ACCOUNT OF HER EXPLOITS IN THE WEST HAD NOT MADE THEIR WAY TO THE SEABOARD WITH THE PROMPTITUDE THAT HE HAD LOOKED FOR
MONTHS BEFORE WHEN SHE WROTE TO HIM IT HAD BEEN WITH THE SENSE RATHER OF PUTTING HIM IN DEBT
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT SHE INVITED ME WHEN I MET HER OH OF COURSE SHE ATTRACTS MANY VISITORS SAID MISS BIRDSEYE LIMITING HER ENCOURAGEMENT TO THIS STATEMENT
HE LOOKED AT HIS CHILD ONLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SERVICE SHE MIGHT RENDER TO HUMANITY
OLIVE CAME HOME SIX WEEKS AGO
EVERYTHING TO HIM WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME HE HAD NO SENSE OF PROPORTION OR QUALITY
WHEN VERENA WANTED TO ADMIRE SHE WENT AHEAD OF EVERY ONE AND IT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS STIMULATED BY THE YOUNG LADY IN CHARLES STREET
I CONSIDER WOMEN HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE REASONABLE HIS COMPANION TURNED UPON HIM SLOWLY AND MILDLY AND EACH OF HER GLASSES IN HER ASPECT OF REPROACH HAD THE GLITTER OF AN ENORMOUS TEAR
THESE CONSISTED IN A STANDING CLAIM TO THE GENEROSITY AND TENDERNESS OF THE STRONGER RACE
IF VERENA HAD ANYTHING SUGGESTIVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIAL PROBLEM THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD COME--THAT WAS PART OF THEIR FAITH
IT CAME OVER OUR YOUNG LADY THAT WHEN SHE SOUGHT THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HER DISTANT KINSMAN SHE HAD INDEED DONE A MORE COMPLICATED THING THAN SHE SUSPECTED
HE HADN'T PREVENTED ON THE SPOT THOUGH HE WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST THINGS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER FOR SO LONG--THIS QUICK CONFIDENT VISIT OF VERENA TARRANT
THEN BEFORE HE COULD ANSWER HER SHE RECOGNISED HIM
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT RANSOM REJOINED FEELING THAT IF HE WAS TO COME TO THIS HE NEEDN'T HAVE HAD SCRUPLES AT FIRST
IT SEEMED TO SAY THAT SHE WOULD SMILE MORE IF SHE HAD TIME BUT THAT YOU COULD SEE WITHOUT THIS THAT SHE WAS GENTLE AND EASY TO BEGUILE
I OF II BY HENRY JAMES
THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT-RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS BASIL RANSOM STARED
HIS DISHONESTY HOWEVER ONLY EXPOSED HIM THE MORE
SHE'S JUST ARRANGING HER IDEAS AND TRYING TO GET IN REPORT
DO YOU KNOW FAUST SAID OLIVE
OLIVE TOO WAS GOING SOMEWHERE AFTER DINNER BUT HE MUSTN'T MIND THAT
HER IMPATIENCE WAS SUCH THAT BEFORE THE GIRL HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES IN THE ROOM SHE JUMPED TO HER POINT--INQUIRED OF HER INTERRUPTING HERSELF INTERRUPTING EVERYTHING
IF THEY FAILED TO BE COMPLETELY SO IT WAS ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE ELDER GIRL'S REGRET THAT THE SUBJECT AS TO WHICH HER JUDGEMENT WAS WANTED SHOULD BE A YOUNG MAN DESTITUTE OF THE WORST VICES
ALL THAT OLIVE ASKED OF HER WAS THAT FOR THE TIME SHE SHOULD REGARD CHARLES STREET AS HER HOME
THAT THIS ELOQUENT WOMAN HAD PROMISED TO FAVOUR THE COMPANY WITH A FEW REMINISCENCES OF HER LAST CAMPAIGN
HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CONVENIENCE--THEY HAD TAKEN SO MANY HOUSES THAT ANOTHER MORE OR LESS DIDN'T MATTER--AND MRS TARRANT BEGAN TO FEEL AS IF THEY REALLY HAD STRUCK SOMETHING
BUT THE GIRL NOW TRAVERSED THE FIELDS OF LITERATURE WITH HER CHARACTERISTIC LIGHTNESS OF STEP
THAT PAST SHE BY NO MEANS ABSOLUTELY DEPLORED FOR IT HAD THE MERIT OF HAVING INITIATED VERENA AND HER PATRONESS THROUGH HER AGENCY INTO THE MISERIES AND MYSTERIES OF THE PEOPLE
BUT THERE WAS A FALSE NOTE WHEN SHE SPOKE TO HER YOUNG FRIEND ABOUT THE LADIES IN BEACON STREET
IT ASSUMED THAT COMPLEXION VERY DEFINITELY WHEN SHE CROSSED OVER TO HER DESK AND WROTE MR TARRANT A CHEQUE FOR A VERY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
SHE WAS A VERY ODD COUSIN WAS THIS BOSTON COUSIN OF HIS
HOW LONG DID SHE EXPECT TO HOLD HER BACK
I CAN'T DO MUCH WITH A SMALL AUDIENCE I WISH WE HAD BROUGHT SOME OF OUR FRIENDS--THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO COME IF WE HAD GIVEN THEM A CHANCE SAID MR BURRAGE
SHE STOPPED ON THE SIDE-WALK AND LOOKED VAGUELY ABOUT HER IN THE MANNER OF A PERSON WAITING FOR AN OMNIBUS OR A STREET-CAR
AFTER THIS SHE ADDED WITH A FRIENDLINESS MORE PERSONAL AIN'T YOU GOING TO SEE YOUR COUSIN TOO NOT IF I CAN HELP IT MISS BIRDSEYE GAVE A LITTLE INEFFECTUAL SIGH
IT WILL SEEM TO COME RIGHT DOWN FROM--WELL WHEREVER IT DOES COME FROM YES WE DON'T PRETEND TO SAY THAT MRS TARRANT MURMURED
SHE HAD CURIOUS RADIANT LIQUID EYES THEIR SMILE WAS A SORT OF REFLEXION LIKE THE GLISTEN OF A GEM AND THOUGH SHE WAS NOT TALL SHE APPEARED TO SPRING UP AND CARRIED HER HEAD AS IF IT REACHED RATHER HIGH
SHE'S A VERY NOBLE CHARACTER OH YES A GLORIOUS NATURE YOU KNOW THEIR OPINIONS ARE JUST THE SAME--HERS AND VERENA'S MISS BIRDSEYE PLACIDLY CONTINUED
THIS EPISODE HAD IMPARTED ANIMATION TO THE ASSEMBLY
SHE HAD A KIND OF DOLEFUL ELEGANCE TRIED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL LOWERED HER VOICE AND LOOKED AS IF SHE WISHED TO ESTABLISH A SECRET UNDERSTANDING IN ORDER TO ASK HER VISITOR IF SHE WOULD VENTURE ON AN APPLE-FRITTER
VERENA AS YET HAD NO SENSE OF BEING SCORCHED
HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH OLIVE CHANCELLOR MRS LUNA CONTINUED MAKING HER POINTS AS SHE ALWAYS DID WITH EAGERNESS THOUGH HER ROUNDNESS AND HER DIMPLES HAD HITHERTO PREVENTED HER FROM BEING ACCUSED OF THAT VICE
SO WE TOLD MR GRACIE OF COURSE TO BRING HIM RIGHT ROUND
THE GIRL WAS NOW COMPLETELY UNDER HER INFLUENCE
SHE TOOK NONE OF IT TO HERSELF SHE REGARDED IT ONLY AS A BRILLIANT EXPRESSION OF VERENA'S GIFT
I HEARD HER LAST SPRING AT TOPEKA
HE STAYED A GOOD WHILE LONGER NEARLY AN HOUR AND SAID THINGS THAT MADE VERENA THINK THAT HE PERHAPS WOULD LIKE TO MARRY HER
RANSOM SAW THAT SHE WOULD COME AND SEE ANY ONE WHO WOULD ASK HER LIKE THAT AND HE REGRETTED FOR A MINUTE THAT HE WAS NOT A BOSTON LADY SO THAT HE MIGHT EXTEND TO HER SUCH AN INVITATION
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MADE THEM ALL SO LATE
BESIDES I HAVE BEEN DOWN SOUTH IN THE OLD TIMES AND I CAN'T SAY THEY LET ME SLEEP VERY MUCH
THERE WAS A WANT OF CONVIVIAL MOVEMENT AND AMONG MOST OF THE VISITORS EVEN OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION
BUT THE THING REFERRED ITSELF IN OLIVE'S MIND TO A DANGER WHICH CAST A PERPETUAL SHADOW THERE--THE POSSIBILITY OF THE GIRL'S EMBARKING WITH SOME INGENUOUS YOUTH ON AN EXPEDITION THAT WOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN AN EVENING
YET AMONG MRS TARRANT'S MULTIFARIOUS MEMORIES THESE REMINISCENCES OF THE DARKENED ROOM THE WAITING CIRCLE THE LITTLE TAPS ON TABLE AND WALL THE LITTLE TOUCHES ON CHEEK AND FOOT THE MUSIC IN THE AIR THE RAIN OF FLOWERS THE SENSE OF SOMETHING MYSTERIOUSLY FLITTING WERE MOST TENDERLY CHERISHED
MOREOVER THE GIRL HAD MOVED HER AS SHE HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED AND THE POWER TO DO THAT FROM WHATEVER SOURCE IT CAME WAS A FORCE THAT ONE MUST ADMIRE
THERE COULDN'T BE ANY DANGER FOR VERENA FROM A MIND THAT TOOK MERELY A GOSSIP'S VIEW OF GREAT TENDENCIES
THEY THOUGHT TO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SELDOM REAPPEARED SO THAT AT LAST HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER THERE WERE NOT A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIS SOUTHERN COMPLEXION
AND VERENA SAID THAT THIS OF COURSE WOULD BE VERY SIMPLE--ONLY HER MOTHER WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL HER SO WELL AS OLIVE WHETHER SHE OUGHT TO RESPECT MR BURRAGE
THOSE VIEWS ARE JUST HER LIFE WELL SHE MAY BRING ME ROUND TO THEM SAID RANSOM SMILING
AND MEANWHILE THEY STOOD IN THE SUN WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST AN APOTHECARY'S WINDOW AND SHE TRIED AGAIN AT HIS SUGGESTION TO REMEMBER THE NAME OF DOCTOR TARRANT'S STREET
SO IT WAS THAT OLIVE PASSED IN THREE MONTHS FROM THE STAGE OF VENERATION TO THAT OF COMPETITION
HE LEFT HIS BUSINESS AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND REMAINED WITH HIS YOUNG KINSMAN TILL THE HOUR OF DINNER
HE HAD ALWAYS HEARD BOSTON WAS A CITY OF CULTURE AND NOW THERE WAS CULTURE IN MISS CHANCELLOR'S TABLES AND SOFAS IN THE BOOKS THAT WERE EVERYWHERE ON LITTLE SHELVES LIKE BRACKETS AS IF A BOOK WERE A STATUETTE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND WATERCOLOURS THAT COVERED THE WALLS IN THE CURTAINS THAT WERE FESTOONED RATHER STIFFLY IN THE DOORWAYS
SHE LIKED INTELLECTUAL COMPANIONSHIP AND SHE HAD NONE NOW
I HOPE VERY MUCH I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN HE REMARKED AS THEY WENT
IT SUITED HER MORE TO HOLD THAT MISS CHANCELLOR HAD BEEN VERY GRACIOUS THAT SHE WAS A MOST DESIRABLE FRIEND THAT SHE HAD BEEN MORE AFFECTED THAN ANY ONE BY VERENA'S BEAUTIFUL OUTPOURING
AND IT WAS NOT MERELY A HUMOROUS IDEA WITH HIM THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE DEFECTS OF SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN THEY WERE AT ANY RATE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR CHIVALRY
THE SERIOUS TIRED PEOPLE IN THEIR BONNETS AND OVERCOATS BEGAN TO GLOW LIKE A COMPANY OF HEROES
SHE DIDN'T RESEMBLE A PERSON WHO WOULD LIKE HIM TO MARRY THE DAUGHTER OF A MESMERIC HEALER AND YET SHE APPEARED TO THINK IT CHARMING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A YOUNG WOMAN THERE TO GIVE GUSTO TO HER HOUR AT CAMBRIDGE
YOU ONLY KNEW WHEN HE WAS JOKING WITH WOMEN BY HIS SUPER-ADDED CIVILITY
THEY SEEM TO ME POOR CREATURES AND INDEED HER UPPERMOST FEELING IN REGARD TO THEM WAS A KIND OF COLD SCORN
IF THE INFLUENCE OF WOMEN IN THE PAST ACCOUNTED FOR EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE THAT MEN HAD HAPPENED TO ACHIEVE IT ONLY MADE THE MATTER BALANCE PROPERLY THAT THE INFLUENCE OF MEN SHOULD EXPLAIN THE CASUAL IRREGULARITIES OF THE OTHER SEX
BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS A PRETTY GIRL ENOUGH IF ONE CARED FOR HAIR OF THE COLOUR OF COCHINEAL
VERENA THOUGHT A MOMENT AS IF TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HER COMPANION REFERRED TO AND THEN SHE INQUIRED ALWAYS SMILING WHERE JOAN OF ARC HAD GOT HER IDEA OF THE SUFFERING OF FRANCE
MISS BIRDSEYE'S MODESTY HAD NEVER PRETENDED THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE PUBLICLY CHALLENGED
HE WAS ONLY WAITING LIKE THE REST
HIS EYES WANDERED ROUND THE CORNICE OF THE ROOM AND HE GRINNED UPWARD AS IF AT AN IMAGINARY GALLERY
SHE HAD THE ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS THE DRAWBACKS OF A NERVOUS ORGANISATION
IT WAS PERCEPTIBLE TO HIM THAT SHE SAW SHE WOULD BE EFFECTIVE WOULD HELP THE CAUSE
THEN AFTER A SHORT FURTHER DELAY SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK
SHE WISHED IMMENSELY TO BE GENEROUS AND HOW COULD ONE BE GENEROUS UNLESS ONE RAN A RISK
ISN'T MISS CHANCELLOR YOUR COUSIN WE DON'T INSIST ON THE RELATIONSHIP SAID RANSOM SMILING
WHEN MISS BIRDSEYE SPOKE AS IF ONE WERE A LEADER OF SOCIETY OLIVE COULD FORGIVE HER EVEN THAT ODIOUS EXPRESSION BECAUSE OF COURSE ONE NEVER PRETENDED THAT SHE POOR DEAR HAD THE SMALLEST SENSE OF THE REAL
JUST LET HER OVERFLOW AND AGAIN TARRANT ILLUMINATED HIS INQUIRY HIS METAPHOR BY THE STRANGE AND SILENT LATERAL MOVEMENT OF HIS JAWS
I KNOW IT
ON THAT CONTINENT OF STRANGERS THEY WOULD CLEAVE MORE CLOSELY STILL TO EACH OTHER
HE WONDERED WHAT TYPE AFTER ALL HE HAD GOT HOLD OF AND WHAT GAME WAS BEING PLAYED WITH HIM
MISS VERENA WAS A NATURAL GENIUS AND HE HOPED VERY MUCH SHE WASN'T GOING TO TAKE THE NATURE OUT OF HER
THERE WERE SOME NIGHTS OF DEEP SNOWFALL WHEN CHARLES STREET WAS WHITE AND MUFFLED AND THE DOOR-BELL FOREDOOMED TO SILENCE WHICH SEEMED LITTLE ISLANDS OF LAMP-LIGHT OF ENLARGED AND INTENSIFIED VISION
HE ALWAYS SAID MA'AM IN SPEAKING TO OLIVE TO WHOM MOREOVER THE AIR HAD NEVER BEEN SO FILLED WITH THE SOUND OF HER OWN NAME
SHE REMARKED TO HIM THAT THEY MIGHT TALK FOR EVER WITHOUT COMING TO AN AGREEMENT--THEIR POINTS OF VIEW WERE SO FAR APART
HENRY BURRAGE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THROW MISS CHANCELLOR INTO A STATE AS THESE YOUNG LADIES CALLED IT THE NIGHT SHE MET HIM AT MRS TARRANT'S
VERENA LOOKING AT HER FRIEND NOT FOR PERMISSION BUT FOR SYMPATHY DROPPED AGAIN INTO A CHAIR AND RANSOM WAITED TO SEE MISS CHANCELLOR DO THE SAME
SO HE PRODUCED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LABOUR HALF-A-DOZEN ARTICLES FROM WHICH WHEN THEY WERE FINISHED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD OMITTED ALL THE POINTS HE WISHED MOST TO MAKE AND ADDRESSED THEM TO THE POWERS THAT PRESIDE OVER WEEKLY AND MONTHLY PUBLICATIONS
THAT'S ALL WE SHALL ASK OF YOU
I LIKE MISS TARRANT'S LOVELY FACE BETTER TO BEGIN WITH WELL SHE IS PRETTY-LOOKING AND MISS BIRDSEYE GAVE ANOTHER SIGH AS IF SHE HAD HAD A THEORY SUBMITTED TO HER--THAT ONE ABOUT A LADY'S OPINIONS--WHICH WITH ALL THAT WAS UNFAMILIAR AND PECULIAR LYING BEHIND IT SHE WAS REALLY TOO OLD TO LOOK INTO MUCH
WITH THIS VIEW THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN HAD MADE MORE THAN ONE PILGRIMAGE TO ROXBURY AND ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS THE SIBYLLINE MOOD IN ITS MOST CHARMING FORM HAD DESCENDED UPON VERENA
SHE DIDN'T READ MUCH--NOT FOR AMUSEMENT
SHE KNEW HE WAS AN AWFUL HUMBUG AND YET HER KNOWLEDGE HAD THIS IMPERFECTION THAT HE HAD NEVER CONFESSED IT--A FACT THAT WAS REALLY GRAND WHEN ONE THOUGHT OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES FOR DOING SO
BUT IF YOU ARE NOT IN SYMPATHY PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER NOT COME SHE WENT ON
DO YOU REGARD US THEN SIMPLY AS LOVELY BAUBLES THE EFFECT OF THIS QUESTION AS COMING FROM MISS BIRDSEYE AND REFERRING IN SOME DEGREE TO HER OWN VENERABLE IDENTITY WAS SUCH AS TO MOVE HIM TO IRRESISTIBLE LAUGHTER
