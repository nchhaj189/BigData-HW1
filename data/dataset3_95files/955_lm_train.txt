SEND THAT BEAST AWAY AND I WILL SHE SAID
OFF YOU GO
ON HER RIGHT BUT A LITTLE LOWER WAS DOROTHY AND ON HER LEFT THE SCARECROW
AS FOR HER BEING A GIRL THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU SHOULD OBEY HER LAWS IF YOU ARE COURTEOUS AND POLITE
A HEART MUST BE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO ONE
DOROTHY KNEW ALMOST EVERYBODY IN OZ AND IT WAS SHE WHO HAD DISCOVERED THE SCARECROW THE TIN WOODMAN AND THE COWARDLY LION AS WELL AS TIK-TOK THE CLOCKWORK MAN
A FEW STEPS BEYOND THE MOUTH OF THE OPENING IT WAS PITCH DARK
BUT THAT RENDERS YOUR UNCLE A MOST AGREEABLE COMPANION AND GOSSIP DECLARED DR PIPT
OF COURSE THEN WHY IS THE PRISON SO FINE AND WHY ARE YOU SO KIND TO ME HE EARNESTLY ASKED
IT IS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND FRIENDS ON YOUR JOURNEY WHO WILL ASSIST YOU IN YOUR SEARCH
BUT WHAT IS THE FIFTH AND LAST THING YOU NEED IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE MAGIC CHARM THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY SAID OJO
WELL WHEN IT IS QUITE FINISHED THIS COMPOUND WILL BE THE WONDERFUL POWDER OF LIFE WHICH NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE BUT MYSELF
YOU WON'T LOSE YOUR WAY THOUGH SAID THE HORNER FOR THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THE PAINT ON MY LEFT EAR HAS PEELED OFF AND FADED WHICH AFFECTS MY HEARING ON THAT SIDE
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO ANGRY REPLIED THE WOOZY
BUT IF I LET YOU GO WHAT WILL YOU DO PICK UP MY QUILLS AGAIN SAID CHISS IN A SULKY VOICE
YOU'RE A NUISANCE MUSIC HATH CHARMS TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST ASSERTED THE PHONOGRAPH SADLY
TASTES DIFFER YOU KNOW REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING AGAIN
WALK
THEY LIVE HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN AND THE GOOD MUNCHKIN COUNTRY WHERE THE FRUITS AND FLOWERS GROW IS JUST THE OTHER SIDE
ALL RIGHT REPLIED DIKSEY WHO SEEMED A GOOD-NATURED MAN
THAT'S THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO IS NAMED DR PIPT AND HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE
YOU'VE INSULTED THEM AND YOU'D BETTER BEG THEIR PARDON SAID SCRAPS
I'VE JUST COMPOSED A TUNE CALLED THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR IT'S IN PATCH-TIME WHICH IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO RAG-TIME AND I'VE COMPOSED IT IN HONOR OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED HOW DID YOU KNOW I HAD ARRIVED ASKED SCRAPS MUCH INTERESTED
I SUPPOSE MOST PEOPLE NEVER NOTICE THE GOOD LUCK THAT COMES TO THEM WITH THE NUMBER 13 AND YET IF THE LEAST BIT OF BAD LUCK FALLS ON THAT DAY THEY BLAME IT TO THE NUMBER AND NOT TO THE PROPER CAUSE THIRTEEN'S MY LUCKY NUMBER TOO REMARKED THE SCARECROW
THIS IS SOMEWHERE ISN'T IT ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAUGHING AT THE BEWILDERED LOOKS OF THE OTHERS
WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER
COME ON BUNGLE SAID HE
I DO NOT WISH HER TO FEEL ABOVE HER STATION AS THE GLASS CAT DOES
ALSO SHE HAS A PRETTY BLOOD-RED HEART BUT IT IS MADE OF STONE--A RUBY I THINK--AND SO IS RATHER HARD AND UNFEELING
THERE'S A PATCHWORK GIRL AND A WHAT A GIRL MADE OF PATCHWORK YOU KNOW
IF YOU TALK TOO MUCH YOU'LL WEAR OUT YOUR SCARLET PLUSH TONGUE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HEMMED ON THE EDGES
BUT ALAS UNC NUNKIE WAS NOW A MARBLE STATUE IN THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND OJO MUST NOT FALTER IN HIS EFFORTS TO SAVE HIM
THIS MOUTH OJO CONSIDERED VERY ARTISTIC AND LIFELIKE AND MARGOLOTTE WAS PLEASED WHEN THE BOY PRAISED IT
NOW IT WASN'T LIKELY THAT DOROTHY WOULD BE LOOKING FOR WIRELESS MESSAGES OR WOULD HEED THE CALL
THERE WAS ONCE A WOODCHOPPER A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS MADE ALL OF TIN AND I USED TO LAUGH EVERY TIME I SAW HIM A TIN WOODCHOPPER SAID OJO
WHERE'S THE GOLD FLASK DOROTHY HE ASKED AND THE LITTLE GIRL HANDED HIM THE FLASK WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER
THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL ALL THOSE SWEET POEMS JUST FOOLISHNESS REPLIED OJO
WON'T IT BE FUNNY TO RUN ACROSS SOMETHING YELLOW IN THIS DISMAL BLUE COUNTRY THERE ARE WORSE COLORS THAN YELLOW IN THIS COUNTRY ASSERTED THE GLASS CAT IN A SPITEFUL TONE
THE YELLOW WING OF A BUTTERFLY TO FIND MUST OJO ALSO TRY AND IF HE GETS THEM WITHOUT HARM DOC PIPT WILL MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM
BUT A MOUTH IS TO TALK WITH ISN'T IT IT IS ALSO TO EAT WITH REPLIED THE BOY
TO GET THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY IT IS A LONG JOURNEY DECLARED THE MAN AND YOU WILL GO THROUGH LONELY PARTS OF OZ AND CROSS RIVERS AND TRAVERSE DARK FORESTS BEFORE YOU GET THERE SUITS ME ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
WHO PUT NOODLES IN THE SOUP
I DO NOT THINK UNC NUNKIE CARES VERY MUCH TO SEE THE FAMOUS CROOKED MAGICIAN
THE BOY NOTICED THAT HIS UNCLE HAD NOT EATEN THE BREAD AND SUPPOSED THE OLD MAN HAD NOT BEEN HUNGRY
I'LL PROVE IT
BY AND BY OJO LIGHTED THE FIRE AND THE LOGS BLAZED FREELY IN THE BROAD FIREPLACE
THE WOOZY LOOKED AT THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY
IT WOULD PLEASE US VERY MUCH AND BY THESE EXCLAMATIONS THE SCARECROW KNEW THAT HIS SPEECH HAD MET WITH FAVOR
AFTER THIS THE SHAGGY MAN RELEASED CHISS AND LET HIM GO KNOWING THAT HE WAS HARMLESS TO INJURE ANYONE
CAN YOU GROWL ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
ALL THE FINGERS AND THUMBS OF THE GIRL'S HANDS HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FORMED AND STUFFED AND STITCHED AT THE EDGES WITH GOLD PLATES AT THE ENDS TO SERVE AS FINGER-NAILS
NO SERVANT WILL COME HERE BECAUSE THE PLACE IS SO LONELY AND OUT-OF-THE-WAY SO MY CLEVER HUSBAND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN PROPOSED THAT I MAKE A GIRL OUT OF SOME SORT OF MATERIAL AND HE WOULD MAKE HER LIVE BY SPRINKLING OVER HER THE POWDER OF LIFE
I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED
I'M TRANSPARENT EXCEPT FOR MY EXQUISITE RED HEART AND MY LOVELY PINK BRAINS--YOU CAN SEE EM WORK SHOO--SHOO--SHOO CRIED SCRAPS DANCING AROUND AND LAUGHING
THEY COULDN'T SEE THAT WITH ONLY ONE LEG THEY MUST HAVE LESS UNDER-STANDING THAN WE WHO HAVE TWO LEGS
THESE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE AMONG MY PEOPLE OFTEN USING THEIR POWERS FOR EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD THAT I DECIDED TO FORBID ANYONE TO PRACTICE MAGIC OR SORCERY EXCEPT GLINDA THE GOOD AND HER ASSISTANT THE WIZARD OF OZ BOTH OF WHOM I CAN TRUST TO USE THEIR ARTS ONLY TO BENEFIT MY PEOPLE AND TO MAKE THEM HAPPIER
OJO FELT VERY MISERABLE AND GREATLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT HE WAS BEGINNING TO GROW ANGRY BECAUSE HE WAS TREATED IN SUCH A DISGRACEFUL MANNER
BUT IF THE TOTTENHOTS SLEPT THERE ALL DAY THE CHILDREN THOUGHT THEY COULD SLEEP THERE AT NIGHT SO OJO LOWERED HIMSELF DOWN AND FOUND IT WAS NOT VERY DEEP
THAT WILL NOT BE BREAKING THE LAW FOR IT IS ALREADY PICKED AND THE CRIME OF PICKING IT IS FORGIVEN THANK YOU CRIED OJO GRATEFULLY
I'LL SING A SONG I COMPOSED MYSELF
ALL ITS LENGTH AND BREADTH WAS PAVED WITH SMOOTH BRICKS OF A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOR SO IT WAS SMOOTH AND LEVEL EXCEPT IN A FEW PLACES WHERE THE BRICKS HAD CRUMBLED OR BEEN REMOVED LEAVING HOLES THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE UNWARY TO STUMBLE
THEN DOROTHY TOLD OF THEIR ADVENTURES IN THE QUADLING COUNTRY AND HOW AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE WATER FROM A DARK WELL
HERE AT LAST WAS A CLOVER WITH SIX SPREADING LEAVES
BUT EVERYONE IN THE LAND OF OZ HAS A PLACE TO LIVE
THEN COVER UP YOUR EARS AND BRACE YOURSELVES FIRMLY
WHAT IS THE NEXT THING OJO MUST GET A YELLOW BUTTERFLY ANSWERED THE BOY
I HOP AND SO DO ALL MY PEOPLE
BUT SOME DISTANCE BEFORE THEM THEY SAW A GROUP OF PALM TREES WITH MANY CURIOUS BLACK DOTS UNDER THEM
NO ONE DISTURBED THE TRAVELERS UNTIL DAYLIGHT WHEN IN POPPED THE TOTTENHOT WHO OWNED THE PLACE AND INVITED THEM TO VACATE HIS PREMISES
WHO CARES FOR EM ANYHOW
THANK YOU FOR NAMING ME MISS CAT
THEN SHE SAID
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU ASKED THE BEAST
THERE'S A FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE IN COUNTRY LIFE THAT NOT EVEN THE EMERALD CITY CAN GIVE ONE
SHE'S DELIGHTFUL IN HER WAY HE SAID
I THINK SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT
I SHALL LET HER WASH THE BREAKFAST DISHES AND SWEEP AND DUST THE HOUSE
SO HE STOPPED SHORT AND WHEN HE STOPPED THE TREE AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS HIS COMPANIONS MOVED ON BEFORE HIM AND LEFT HIM FAR BEHIND
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ BY L
THE GLASS CAT WAS ALSO A WONDERFUL CREATURE TO LITTLE OJO WHO HAD NEVER SEEN OR KNOWN ANYTHING OF MAGIC BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE HAD LIVED IN THE FAIRYLAND OF OZ EVER SINCE HE WAS BORN
SO WHEN I SAID YOU HAD LESS UNDERSTANDING THAN WE I DID NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAD LESS UNDERSTANDING YOU UNDERSTAND BUT THAT YOU HAD LESS STANDUNDERING SO TO SPEAK
NOTHING COULD AWE THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND ALTHOUGH THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT UNEASY IN THESE SPLENDID SURROUNDINGS THE GLASS CAT WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE COURT AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE OCCASION--PRETTY BIG WORDS BUT QUITE EXPRESSIVE
OUR RULER'S A BEWITCHING GIRL WHOM FAIRIES LOVE TO PLEASE
CHILDREN ARE ROUGH PLAYMATES SHE REMARKED TO THE SHAGGY MAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS HOME IS MORE PLEASANT THAN THAT OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN I FEAR I WOULD SOON BE SMASHED TO PIECES BY THE BOYS AND GIRLS AFTER THEY HAD RESTED THEMSELVES THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY FINDING THE ROAD NOW SMOOTH AND PLEASANT TO WALK UPON AND THE COUNTRY GROWING MORE BEAUTIFUL THE NEARER THEY DREW TO THE EMERALD CITY
AND UNLESS HIS BRAINS MAKE HIM SO SUCH WISDOM IS UNACCOUNTABLE IS THE WIZARD OF OZ A HUMBUG ASKED OJO
THE TIN WOODMAN WILL DO ANYTHING WE ASK HIM FOR HE'S ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS
TOTO KNEW THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER AND OFTEN PLAYED AND ROMPED WITH THEM FOR THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS
I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A VERY NEAT AND RESPONSIVE HEART WHICH THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ ONCE GAVE ME AND SO I SHALL NEVER--NEVER--NEVER PERMIT A POOR YELLOW BUTTERFLY TO BE TORTURED BY ANYONE THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES SAID OJO SADLY IS THE ONLY PLACE IN OZ WHERE A YELLOW BUTTERFLY CAN BE FOUND I'M GLAD OF THAT SAID THE TIN WOODMAN
I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC WHILE THE PATCHWORK GIRL COMES TO LIFE
ONE LIKES TO BE RESPECTED AS HIGHLY AS HIS NEIGHBORS ARE SAID THE WOMAN
CHAPTER SEVEN THE TROUBLESOME PHONOGRAPH WHEN THE BOY OPENED HIS EYES NEXT MORNING HE LOOKED CAREFULLY AROUND THE ROOM
I AM QUITE PROUD OF MY PERSON WAS THE REPLY
I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE NOT HAPPIER THAN THE CITY PEOPLE REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN
QUITE TRUE AGREED THE SHAGGY MAN
EACH ONE IS THE SAME AS A DISH OF SOUP A FRIED FISH A MUTTON POT-PIE LOBSTER SALAD CHARLOTTE RUSSE AND LEMON JELLY--ALL MADE INTO ONE LITTLE TABLET THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW WITHOUT TROUBLE WITHOUT TROUBLE EXCLAIMED THE QUADLING MUCH INTERESTED
THAT WON'T DO
I CAUGHT A DROP OF OIL THAT FELL FROM YOUR KNEE-JOINT CONFESSED OJO
IF I HADN'T BEEN THROWN OUT I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE STARS NOR THE BIG GRAY WOLF WHAT WOLF INQUIRED OJO
I WONDER IF THIS IS MY BREAKFAST EAT IT COMMANDED A VOICE AT HIS SIDE SO NEAR THAT OJO JUMPED
QUEE-EE-EE-EEK GO AHEAD AND GROWL SAID SCRAPS
I DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND WHEN I GREW BIG ENOUGH TO WORK THE WITCH MADE ME WAIT UPON HER AND CARRY WOOD FOR THE FIRE AND HOE IN THE GARDEN
THIS SONG WILL PROVE A RARE TREAT TO YOU I KNOW
THE CAT WALKED UP TO THE BENCH ON WHICH THE PATCHWORK GIRL RECLINED AND LOOKED AT HER ATTENTIVELY
I USED TO LIVE IN THE BIG OUTSIDE WORLD
THEN HE TURNED TO THE MUNCHKIN BOY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU BACK BEFORE TO-MORROW AT THE EARLIEST WELL SAID THE SCARECROW I MET A CHARMING GIRL ON THE ROAD AND WANTED TO SEE MORE OF HER SO I HURRIED BACK OZMA LAUGHED
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE WERE DOROTHY AND OJO LOOKING BETWEEN THE PICKETS
I WANT HER TO KNOW JUST ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MUCH WITH THIS SHE WENT TO ANOTHER CUPBOARD WHICH WAS FILLED WITH SHELVES
THEY KNEW IT WAS A GREAT FISH BECAUSE IT PULLED SO HARD ON THE LINE THAT IT DRAGGED THE RAFT FORWARD EVEN FASTER THAN THE CURRENT OF THE RIVER HAD CARRIED IT
NO GRASS NOR FLOWERS NOR TREES GREW IN THIS CAVE SO THE YARDS SURROUNDING THE HOUSES CARVED IN DESIGNS BOTH WERE SMOOTH AND BARE AND HAD LOW WALLS AROUND THEM TO MARK THEIR BOUNDARIES
BUT NOW THEY HAD STARTED OUT TO MINGLE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAME TO PROVED SO INTERESTING THAT OJO COULD SCARCELY SLEEP A WINK ALL NIGHT
NOTHING CAN KILL ME AS YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL PERHAPS THAT IS TRUE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IN A TONE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AND THAT STRANGE CREATURE ON TOP THE FENCE--WHY DOESN'T HE STOP KICKING?--MUST BE YOUR BROTHER OR FATHER OR SON FOR HE ALSO HAS TWO LEGS YOU MUST HAVE BEEN TO VISIT THE WISE DONKEY SAID SCRAPS LAUGHING SO MERRILY THAT THE CROWD SMILED WITH HER IN SYMPATHY
THE LEAVES GRABBED THEM ALL SAID THE BOY
YOU ARE RIGHTLY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY MY POOR BOY SINCE YOU HAVE BROKEN A LAW OF OZ
THE SURFACE OF THIS METAL WAS HIGHLY ORNAMENTED IN RAISED DESIGNS REPRESENTING MEN ANIMALS FLOWERS AND TREES AND FROM THE METAL ITSELF WAS RADIATED THE SOFT LIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE ROOM
I WONDER WE DIDN'T NOTICE IT OURSELVES
GET ME A PRISONER'S ROBE FROM YOUR OFFICIAL WARDROBE THE GUARDIAN UNLOCKED A CLOSET AND TOOK FROM IT A WHITE ROBE WHICH THE SOLDIER THREW OVER OJO
SO THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE HOUSE WHERE A LITTLE LIGHT-BROWN DONKEY DRESSED IN A BLUE APRON AND A BLUE CAP WAS ENGAGED IN DUSTING THE FURNITURE WITH A BLUE CLOTH
I KNEW IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW BUT I WANTED TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE AND I WAS AFRAID IF I ASKED YOUR CONSENT TO PICK IT YOU WOULD REFUSE ME WHAT CAUSED YOU TO THINK THAT ASKED THE RULER
DON'T YOU LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC NO VIC SAID SCRAPS HALTING
PERHAPS AS THE MAGICIAN SAID YOU HAVE AN OVERDOSE AND THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHAT HAD YOU TO DO WITH MY BRAINS ASKED SCRAPS
HE SPOKE FOR THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE WHO TREATED HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT
MOVE ON FOR THE SOONER YOU DO THAT THE SOONER YOU'LL GET TO THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ HOOT-TI-TOOT-TI-TOOT-TI-TOO SCREECHED THE OWL
WHY ARE WE SO POOR UNC REPEATED THE BOY
GIVE ME ONE PLEASE SO THE SHAGGY MAN GAVE THE WOOZY A TABLET FROM HIS BOTTLE AND THE BEAST ATE IT IN A TWINKLING
RUN ALONG VIC AND BOTHER SOME ONE ELSE ADVISED SCRAPS
THEY COULD NOT SEE WHERE THE LIGHT WHICH FLOODED THE PLACE SO PLEASANTLY CAME FROM FOR THERE WERE NO LAMPS ANYWHERE VISIBLE
WHEN HE GRASPED UNC'S HAND IT WAS COLD AND HARD
AS YOU ARE A STRANGER I WILL EXPLAIN THIS LAW WHICH TO YOU SEEMS SO FOOLISH
BUT THE CAT WAS TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN OJO'S ADVENTURES AND REFUSED TO STOP
MISTER YOOP SEEMS TO BE ASLEEP JUST NOW BUT THE GIANT WASN'T ASLEEP
GOOD I-DEA HE SAID
TO TEAR A WING FROM ONE WOULD CAUSE IT EXQUISITE TORTURE AND IT WOULD SOON DIE IN GREAT AGONY
PERHAPS IT'S THE RADIUM BUT I RATHER THINK IT'S MY SPLENDID INTELLECT IF YOU DON'T QUIT IT THE SCARECROW TOLD HIM THERE'LL BE A WORSE WAR THAN THE ONE YOU'VE ESCAPED FROM OJO HAD BEEN DEEP IN THOUGHT AND NOW HE ASKED THE CHIEF
SEEMS TO ME I'VE BEEN TOLD BEFORE THAT YOU CAN'T BE KILLED
LET US DO AS THIS GIRL SAYS AND LAUGH WITH THE HORNERS SO AS TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE SEE THE JOKE
SHE BROUGHT JACK PUMPKINHEAD TO LIFE FOR ONE THING WAS THE REPLY
VERY WELL
OJO DRESSED
SO THERE BEING NO HONEY-BEES HERE I'VE EATEN NOTHING FOR YEARS
BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OZMA MENTION THOSE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN'T BE VERY IMPORTANT IS THIS MOUNTAIN IN THE LAND OF OZ ASKED SCRAPS
IT'S THAT MUSIC THING WHICH THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SCATTERED THE POWDER OF LIFE OVER SAID OJO
THE HORNERS EACH HAVE TWO LEGS JUST AS YOU HAVE
THIS ENCLOSURE ALL GREEN AND GOLD AND GLITTERING WITH PRECIOUS GEMS WAS INDEED A WONDERFUL SIGHT TO GREET OUR TRAVELERS WHO FIRST OBSERVED IT FROM THE TOP OF A LITTLE HILL
SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ARRESTED OR IMPRISONED--UNTIL OJO BROKE THE LAW SEEMS TO ME THAT GIRL RULER OF YOURS IS MAKING A BIG FUSS OVER NOTHING REMARKED SCRAPS TOSSING HER YARN HAIR OUT OF HER EYES WITH A JERK OF HER PATCHED HEAD
WHO WOULD THINK SUCH A FUNNY HARLEQUIN LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ
WE MUST GO HE CAST ANOTHER GLANCE ABOUT THE ROOM AND SPEAKING TO THE AIR HE SAID
THERE'S QUITE A HOLE SHE SAID
IT MAY BE HARD TO FIND THE THINGS I NEED TO MAKE THIS MAGIC COMPOUND BUT IF THEY WERE FOUND I COULD DO IN AN INSTANT WHAT WILL OTHERWISE TAKE SIX LONG WEARY YEARS OF STIRRING KETTLES WITH BOTH HANDS AND BOTH FEET ALL RIGHT
AS FOR THE GLASS CAT THE QUILLS RATTLED OFF HER BODY WITHOUT MAKING EVEN A SCRATCH AND THE SKIN OF THE WOOZY WAS SO THICK AND TOUGH THAT HE WAS NOT HURT AT ALL
SO IT IS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW
HE WATCHED THIS DROP OF OIL WITH A FAST-BEATING HEART AND FEELING IN HIS POCKET BROUGHT OUT A TINY VIAL OF CRYSTAL WHICH HE HELD SECRETED IN HIS HAND
SHE'S SO TRANSPARENT EVERY ACT IS CLEAR TO US AND THAT'S A FACT HAVE YOU NOTICED MY PINK BRAINS INQUIRED BUNGLE PROUDLY
GIVE ME SOME BREAD AND CHEESE OJO NO NO
BUT JUST THEN THERE CAME A SCRATCHING AT THE BACK DOOR AND A SHRILL VOICE CRIED
SOME OF MY FOLKS ARE CRYING ABOUT IT
I'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT WE MUST GO TO THE MOUNTAINS SO HAVE I SAID DOROTHY
AND THOUGH I DON'T MUCH CARE FOR HIM I WILL SAY THAT HE HAS ALWAYS REFUSED TO WORK MAGIC FOR ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO HIS HOUSE
YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
THE SHAGGY MAN HAS THOUSANDS OF HAIRS BUT NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED HIM OF BEING IMPORTANT SO OJO RELATED THE SAD STORY OF UNC NUNKIE'S TRANSFORMATION INTO A MARBLE STATUE AND TOLD HOW HE HAD SET OUT TO FIND THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WANTED IN ORDER TO MAKE A CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE HIS UNCLE TO LIFE
THEN I CAN TELL YOU BETTER WHETHER IT IS GRATEFUL TO MY APPETITE RETURNED THE WOOZY
THE LEAF HELD HIM FIRMLY AND HE WAS A PRISONER
I'LL SING A SONG OF OZLAND WHERE WONDROUS CREATURES DWELL AND FRUITS AND FLOWERS AND SHADY BOWERS ABOUND IN EVERY DELL WHERE MAGIC IS A SCIENCE AND WHERE NO ONE SHOWS SURPRISE IF SOME AMAZING THING TAKES PLACE BEFORE HIS VERY EYES
THAT SEEMS A LOT MORE SENSIBLE THAN THOSE STIRRING TIMES WITH THE KETTLES THAT'S THE IDEA SCRAPS SAID THE GLASS CAT APPROVINGLY
DESPAIR FELL UPON HIM WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL HIS LITTLE PARTY HAD BEEN CAPTURED EVEN AS HE WAS AND THERE WAS NONE TO SAVE THEM
WHY NOT YOU'D GET BROKEN IN NO TIME AND YOU COULDN'T BE A BIT OF USE TO THE BOY AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL I BEG TO DIFFER WITH YOU RETURNED THE CAT IN A HAUGHTY TONE
WHY WE'RE NOT MOVING FORWARD A BIT NO MATTER HOW FAST WE WALK DECLARED OJO
IF YOU DON'T SHUT OFF THAT MUSIC I'LL SMASH YOUR RECORD THREATENED OJO
BUT IF WE'RE TO REACH THE EMERALD CITY BEFORE SUNDOWN WE MUST HURRY FOR IT IS YET A LONG WAY OFF THE ENTRANCING SIGHT OF THE CITY HAD PUT NEW ENERGY INTO THEM ALL AND THEY HURRIED FORWARD WITH LIGHTER STEPS THAN BEFORE
YOU KNOW IT SPOILS ANY JOKE TO BE OBLIGED TO EXPLAIN IT AND THIS IS THE BEST JOKE I EVER HEARD WHO MADE THE JOKE ASKED SCRAPS
SOME ONE ELSE WILL SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF SCATTERING THAT PHONOGRAPH SAID HE
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND ASKED SCRAPS
I FEAR HE HAS PICKED A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN SADLY
IN AN INSTANT HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS HE HAD COME FOR--ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD RESTORE DEAR UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE
HE WONDERED HOW SHE HAD FOUND OUT SO SOON THAT HE HAD PICKED THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
I AM IN EARNEST BUT DO YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT I WOULD PERMIT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE TO PULL THE LEFT WING FROM A YELLOW BUTTERFLY DEMANDED THE TIN WOODMAN STERNLY
WHEE BUT THERE'S A GAUDY DAME
POOR MARGOLOTTE MUST HAVE GIVEN YOU SOME OF THE QUALITY OF POESY BY MISTAKE HE SAID
YOU WALK WITH YOUR LEGS AND SO THAT'S THE WAY YOU WALK AND YOUR LEGS ARE THE WAYS
FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SENT ME TO GET WAS A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY
PERHAPS SO
FORTUNATELY WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM THE SCARECROW AND SCRAPS WERE IN FRONT AND THE OTHERS BUMPED AGAINST THEM SO THAT NO ONE WAS HURT
AFTER PROCEEDING SOME DISTANCE TOTO WHO HAD GONE ON AHEAD BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY
TOTO HER DOG SLOWLY UNCURLED HIMSELF AND GOING TO THE PATCHWORK GIRL SNIFFED AT HER INQUIRINGLY
BUILT BENEATH THIS VAST DOME WAS A PRETTY VILLAGE--NOT VERY LARGE FOR THERE SEEMED NOT MORE THAN FIFTY HOUSES ALTOGETHER--AND THE DWELLINGS WERE OF MARBLE AND ARTISTICALLY DESIGNED
KEEP QUIET WHILE I PLAY YOU THE SPECKLED ALLIGATOR IT WASN'T A VERY BAD TUNE NOR A VERY GOOD ONE BUT ALL LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE SHUT HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND BLEW THE NOTES FROM THE LITTLE INSTRUMENT
I ALWAYS CHEW THE HONEY-BEES WHEN I CATCH THEM
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT
UNTIL SHE IS BROUGHT TO LIFE I CAN DO ANYTHING I PLEASE WITH THIS GIRL
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF GILLS I THINK
I DON'T MIND GEE
NOW THAT I'VE FOUND SUCH PLEASANT COMPANY I CAN TALK AND PLAY TUNES ALL I WANT TO OJO WAS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THIS UNWELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR PARTY
AND THEN SHOOT THEM AT MORE TRAVELERS
PATHS OF BLUE GRAVEL DIVIDED THE VEGETABLE AND FLOWER BEDS AND A WIDER PATH LED UP TO THE FRONT DOOR
WHAT SIGN SHE INQUIRED
THE PATCHWORK GIRL FOLLOWED HIM AND AFTER THEM CAME THE GLASS CAT
WHAT DO YOU S'POSE HE'S DONE SHE ASKED
YES SAID OJO AND TOLD HOW THE WOOZY HAD SET FIRE TO THE FENCE
ISN'T THE COUNTRY AND THE CLIMATE GRAND IT'S THE FINEST COUNTRY IN ALL THE WORLD EVEN IF IT IS A FAIRYLAND AND I'M HAPPY EVERY MINUTE I LIVE IN IT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
OR ARE YOU STILL CRUEL AND SLAPPY TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO SAID DOROTHY
GLINDA THE GOOD HAS TOLD ME OF ONE WAY AND YOU SHALL NOW LEARN HOW GREAT IS THE KNOWLEDGE AND POWER OF OUR PEERLESS SORCERESS AS HE SAID THIS THE WIZARD ADVANCED TO THE STATUE OF MARGOLOTE AND MADE A MAGIC PASS AT THE SAME TIME MUTTERING A MAGIC WORD THAT NONE COULD HEAR DISTINCTLY
OJO WAS SO ASHAMED BOTH OF HIS DISGRACE AND THE FAULT HE HAD COMMITTED THAT HE WAS GLAD TO BE COVERED UP IN THIS WAY SO THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT SEE HIM OR KNOW WHO HE WAS
YOU SEE THE MUSIC CHARMS EM SAID HE
YOU'RE JOKING NOT THIS TIME RETURNED THE SOLDIER WITH A SIGH
BUT WE MUST TAKE THAT RISK DECIDED THE SHAGGY MAN BRAVELY
HERE'S A LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY TOO
TELL ME PLEADED OJO SPEAKING TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHAT MUST WE FIND TO MAKE THE COMPOUND THAT WILL SAVE UNC NUNKIE FIRST WAS THE REPLY I MUST HAVE A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
SCRAPS SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND PATTING HER COTTON WADDING SMOOTH WHERE IT HAD BUNCHED UP
WELL WHAT OF IT ASKED SCRAPS
I WONDER YOU STOOD THE SHOCK SO WELL
YOUR COLORS MIGHT RUN TOO HE SAID
HER TOOTSIE'S BARE BUT SHE DON'T CARE SO WHAT'S THE ODDS TO YOU DEAR ME OJO SAID THE CAT
YOUR GROWL WOULDN'T SCARE A FLY THE WOOZY SEEMED TO BE HUMILIATED AND SURPRISED
IT WAS FUNNY TO SEE HER LAUGH BECAUSE HER CHEEKS WRINKLED UP HER NOSE TIPPED HER SILVER BUTTON EYES TWINKLED AND HER MOUTH CURLED AT THE CORNERS IN A COMICAL WAY
IT MUST BE NICER WHERE THERE ARE NO TREES AND THERE IS ROOM FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE TO LIVE TOGETHER I WONDER IF ANY OF THE PEOPLE WE SHALL MEET WILL BE AS SPLENDID AS I AM SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
I BELIEVE THEY'RE CLINCHED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE WOOZY'S THICK SKIN THEN WHAT SHALL I DO ASKED THE BOY DESPAIRINGLY
MY DEARS I INTRODUCE TO YOU MISS SCRAPS PATCHWORK A LADY WHO IS TRAVELING IN FOREIGN PARTS TO INCREASE HER STORE OF WISDOM THE NINETEEN HORNER GIRLS ALL AROSE AND MADE A POLITE CURTSEY AFTER WHICH THEY RESUMED THEIR SEATS AND REARRANGED THEIR ROBES PROPERLY
BUT THE REASON I VOLPLANED OVER THE FENCE WAS SO I COULD HAVE A TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE HOPPERS WHAT ABOUT THE HOPPERS ASKED THE CHIEF FROWNING
THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND BECAME UNEVEN AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON
WHEN HE SAT UP HE KICKED TOTO ON THE NOSE AND MADE THE DOG HOWL ANGRILY BUT DOROTHY NOW RAN FORWARD AND CAUGHT TOTO'S COLLAR HOLDING HIM BACK
ISN'T SAID HE
MY DAUGHTERS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP ACCORDING TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS LAID DOWN BY A LEADING BACHELOR WHO HAS GIVEN THE SUBJECT MUCH STUDY AND IS HIMSELF A MAN OF TASTE AND CULTURE
I THINK IT IS MERELY AN OVERGROWN PORCUPINE BUT HERE IN OZ THEY CONSIDER CHISS AN EVIL SPIRIT
MY DEAR CHILD--WHAT ARE YOU A RUMMAGE SALE OR A GUESS-ME-QUICK?--IN ME YOU BEHOLD THE BODY-GUARD OF OUR GRACIOUS RULER PRINCESS OZMA AS WELL AS THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ AND THE POLICE FORCE OF THE EMERALD CITY AND ONLY ONE MAN EXCLAIMED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
SHE MAY BE WATCHING THE PICTURE OF US EVEN NOW AND NOTICING EVERYTHING THAT WE DO DOES SHE ALWAYS WATCH THE MAGIC PICTURE ASKED OJO
ASK LIKE A GOOD CAT THEN SHE SAID
I SUPPOSE I AM THE ONLY CROOKED MAGICIAN IN ALL THE WORLD
WE WILL BE GREATLY OBLIGED
YOUR WORLD PLEASES ME FOR IT'S A QUEER WORLD AND LIFE IN IT IS QUEERER STILL
THE WELL MUST BE NATURALLY DARK AND THE WATER MUST NEVER HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY FOR OTHERWISE THE MAGIC CHARM MIGHT NOT WORK AT ALL HOW MUCH OF THE WATER DO YOU NEED ASKED JACK
AS THIS IS THE ONLY WOOZY THAT HAS EVER LIVED EITHER IN THE LAND OF OZ OR OUT OF IT I MUST DESCRIBE IT TO YOU
THAT MAKES A POPULAR SONG POPULAR AND THE TIME IS COMING WHEN IT WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF ALL OTHER SONGS THAT TIME WON'T COME TO US JUST YET SAID THE SHAGGY MAN STERNLY
BUT I LIKE SCRAPS BEST SHE REPLIED WITH A LAUGH
I KNOW OF ONLY ONE TIN PERSON AND THAT IS NICK CHOPPER THE TIN WOODMAN
HERE AM I MADE FROM AN OLD BEDQUILT AND INTENDED TO BE A SLAVE TO MARGOLOTTE RENDERED FREE AS AIR BY AN ACCIDENT THAT NONE OF YOU COULD FORESEE
ONE OF THEM WORE A JEWELED STAR IN HIS HAIR JUST ABOVE HIS HORN AND THIS SEEMED A PERSON OF IMPORTANCE
IT WAS DARK AND SILENT BUT THE BOY WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO REST SO HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED
IT WAS FUN AS IT HAS TURNED OUT REMARKED OJO I CAN NEVER GET THE THINGS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SENT ME FOR
JUST SEARCH THE WHOLE WORLD OVER--SAIL THE SEAS FROM COAST TO COAST NO OTHER NATION IN CREATION QUEERER FOLK CAN BOAST
THE SKINS OF THE HORNERS WERE LIGHT BROWN BUT THEY WORE SNOW-WHITE ROBES AND WERE BARE-FOOTED
THOUGH EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES HE OWED ALLEGIANCE TO OZMA WHO RULED ALL THE LAND AND THE GIRL AND THE TIN MAN WERE WARM PERSONAL FRIENDS
I AM GOING TO TAKE THEM TO SEE DOROTHY ONE MOMENT PLEASE SAID THE SOLDIER BARRING THEIR WAY AS THEY STARTED TO ENTER THE GATE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU NOTHING MUCH REPLIED THE PHONOGRAPH IN A SAD AND DEPRESSED VOICE
BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT IF WE WILL BEHAVE BUT IF YOU WILL BEHAVE
IN THE STREETS AND THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE MANY PEOPLE ALL HAVING ONE LEG GROWING BELOW THEIR BODIES AND ALL HOPPING HERE AND THERE WHENEVER THEY MOVED
OH EXCLAIMED OJO GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER
BUT UNC NUNKIE SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN
YOU'RE ONLY AN ANNOYANCE ANYHOW AND I'M GLAD TO GET RID OF YOU THANK YOU FOR NOTHING THEN ANSWERED THE CAT STIFFLY
THREE HAIRS
LET ME GO
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT AND IF YOU DON'T THE PROPER THING IS TO LOOK AS IF YOU DID
I THINK SAID OJO ALMOST READY TO CRY THROUGH GRIEF OVER UNC NUNKIE'S SAD FATE IT MUST ALL BE MY FAULT IN SOME WAY
I'M ONLY A STUPID BEAST DOROTHY BUT I CAN'T HELP THAT AND IF YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT TO DO TO HELP OJO AND HIS UNCLE I'LL GLADLY DO IT DOROTHY WALKED OVER AND PATTED THE WOOZY ON HIS SQUARE HEAD
YOUR PEOPLE MAY NEED YOU TO HELP CONQUER THE HORNERS AT THIS ALL THE HOPPERS LOOKED DOWNCAST AND SAD
EVERY BIT GONE HE CRIED
UTTERING A HOWL OF RAGE THE MONSTER THREW THE SCARECROW AFTER THEM WITH ONE HAND AND GRABBED SCRAPS WITH THE OTHER
IT WON'T TAKE US LONG TO GET TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY AT THIS RATE THEY HAD FLOATED SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE STREAM AND WERE ENJOYING THE RIDE WHEN SUDDENLY THE RAFT SLOWED UP STOPPED SHORT AND THEN BEGAN TO FLOAT BACK THE WAY IT HAD COME
BUT WHERE DOES THE JOKE COME IN DOROTHY LAUGHED FOR SHE COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH ALL THE OTHERS WERE SOLEMN ENOUGH
THEIR HEARTS BEAT A LITTLE FASTER THAN USUAL AS THEY AGAIN APPROACHED THE GIANT'S CAVE THIS TIME MOVING SWIFTLY FORWARD
DO YOU CHANGE YOUR HEAD ASKED OJO
BUT WHY HE SMILED AS HE SAID IT SCRAPS COULD NOT IMAGINE
IF YOU'LL LET US GET INTO YOUR HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL DAYLIGHT YOU CAN PLAY OUTSIDE ALL YOU WANT TO THAT'S A BARGAIN CRIED THE TOTTENHOT EAGERLY AND HE GAVE A QUEER WHISTLE THAT BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE POPPING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES ON ALL SIDES
THE PHONOGRAPH WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE AND BEGAN DANCING A JIG WITH THE LEGS OF THE TABLE TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED AND THIS DANCE SO ANNOYED DR PIPT THAT HE KICKED THE THING INTO A CORNER AND PUSHED A BENCH AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT QUIET
WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE VOICE
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE FENCE THEY BEGAN TO GET DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SOON WERE IN THE FOREST
SO IT IS REMARKED THE SCARECROW AND IT MEANS A TEDIOUS CLIMB OVER THOSE SHARP ROCKS IF WE CAN'T USE THIS PASSAGE
BUT I MEAN TO FIND OUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE FOREST OJO ADDED
IF I NEVER GET OUT TAKE IT TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO WHOM IT BELONGS THE SHAGGY MAN HAD BEEN GAZING EARNESTLY IN THE BOY'S FACE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO DEFEND HIM OR NOT
SOME ONE CAUGHT HIM AND TOSSED HIM BACK AND SO WITH SHOUTS OF GLEE THEY CONTINUED THROWING THE SCARECROW HERE AND THERE AS IF HE HAD BEEN A BASKET-BALL
THAT ANNOUNCED THE SHAGGY MAN IS A SQUARE MEAL IN CONDENSED FORM
IT OBEYED VERY WELL FOR THE CURRENT WAS MORE SLUGGISH NOW AND SOON THEY HAD REACHED THE BANK AND LANDED SAFELY
ALL IS READY ANSWERED HIS WIFE
HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR--BUT KINDLY BLUE EYES THAT WERE GENTLE AS THOSE OF A COW
AND THERE WAS THE SHAGGY MAN IN A SUIT OF SHAGGY PEA-GREEN SATIN AND AT A TABLE SAT THE LITTLE WIZARD LOOKING QUITE IMPORTANT AND AS IF HE KNEW MUCH MORE THAN HE CARED TO TELL
OJO FINDS THE DARK WELL 25
HO HO THE CHIEF WIPED THE TEARS OF LAUGHTER FROM HIS EYES WITH THE BOTTOM HEM OF HIS WHITE ROBE AND ALL THE OTHER HORNERS WIPED THEIR EYES ON THEIR ROBES FOR THEY HAD LAUGHED JUST AS HEARTILY AS THEIR CHIEF AT THE ABSURD JOKE
SHE HAD CARRIED OJO'S BASKET IN HER HAND UNTIL NOW WHEN SHE DECIDED TO SEE WHAT WAS INSIDE IT
HE HAS A SPLENDID CASTLE IN THE WINKIE COUNTRY NEAR TO THE PALACE OF HIS FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AND HE IS OFTEN TO BE FOUND IN THE EMERALD CITY WHERE HE VISITS DOROTHY AT THE ROYAL PALACE THEN WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE DARK WELL SAID OJO
I HOPE YOUR FRIENDS ARE NOT DIGNIFIED OBSERVED SCRAPS
YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS WELL SAID DOROTHY I'M GLAD OF A LITTLE REST FOR THAT'S A DREA'FUL STEEP PATH AS SHE SPOKE SHE LEANED AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE BIG ROCK THAT STOOD IN THEIR WAY
I HAD NO IDEA AT FIRST THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING
THE ANIMAL WAS COVERED WITH A THICK SMOOTH SKIN AND HAD NO HAIR AT ALL EXCEPT AT THE EXTREME END OF ITS TAIL WHERE THERE GREW EXACTLY THREE STIFF STUBBY HAIRS
HAVING PERFORMED THIS PAINFUL DUTY I SHALL BUT BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE THE PHONOGRAPH TURNED AND DASHED UP THE ROAD AS FAST AS ITS FOUR TABLE-LEGS COULD CARRY IT AND SOON IT HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED FROM THEIR VIEW
I'M CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY YOU KNOW CHAPTER NINETEEN TROUBLE WITH THE TOTTENHOTS A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM THE EMERALD CITY BROUGHT THE LITTLE BAND OF ADVENTURERS TO THE HOME OF JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHICH WAS A HOUSE FORMED FROM THE SHELL OF AN IMMENSE PUMPKIN
JUST LET ME DISCOVER MYSELF IN MY OWN WAY WITH THIS SHE BEGAN AMUSING HERSELF BY LEAPING ACROSS THE BROOK AND BACK AGAIN
BUT THEY KNEW THEY WERE STILL IN THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAD A BRIGHT RED COLOR
OF COURSE SAID OJO WHO WAS OBLIGED TO TALK BECAUSE HIS UNCLE WOULD NOT NO ONE STARVES IN THE LAND OF OZ EITHER
THEN WITH A RED FACE AND EMBARRASSED MANNER HE ROSE TO CONFRONT THE OTHERS
UNKIND WASN'T IT BUT WHAT DO YOU EAT NOW ASKED OJO
THE FIRST LEAF HE CUT DOWN RELEASED SCRAPS AND ON SEEING HER THE SHAGGY MAN THREW BACK HIS SHAGGY HEAD OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH AND LAUGHED SO SHAGGILY AND YET SO MERRILY THAT SCRAPS LIKED HIM AT ONCE
I KNOW MANY OTHER THINGS BUT THEY WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME SIZE--AND THE SAME SAUCY INCONSIDERATE GLASS CAT WITH PINK BRAINS AND A HARD RUBY HEART NO ONE CAN REGRET MORE THAN I THE FACT THAT YOU MADE ME ASSERTED THE CAT CROUCHING UPON THE FLOOR AND SLOWLY SWAYING ITS SPUN-GLASS TAIL FROM SIDE TO SIDE
IF I WERE YOU I'D USE HER FOR A MOP AND MAKE ANOTHER SERVANT THAT IS PRETTIER YOU HAVE A PERVERTED TASTE SNAPPED MARGOLOTTE MUCH ANNOYED AT THIS FRANK CRITICISM
TWO OR THREE HOURS WALK ALONG THIS TRAIL BROUGHT THEM TO A CLEAR LEVEL COUNTRY WHERE THERE WERE A FEW FARMS AND SOME SCATTERED HOUSES
THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE HAD NOT SOME CLEVER MAN INVENTED THE WIRELESS AND AN EQUALLY CLEVER CHILD SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF REACHING THE MYSTERIOUS LAND OF OZ BY ITS MEANS
PLEASE TELL US WHO YOU ARE I'M HIP HOPPER--HIP HOPPER THE CHAMPION CHAMPION WHAT SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE
THAT REDUCES MY DINNER FROM FOUR TO TWO--AND THE DOG
UNC NUNKIE CAME FORWARD TO GREET HIS OLD FRIEND BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SHAKE EITHER HIS HANDS OR HIS FEET WHICH WERE ALL OCCUPIED IN STIRRING HE PATTED THE MAGICIAN'S BALD HEAD AND ASKED
I WONDER SAID OJO LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WAY TO GO WHERE ARE YOU BOUND FOR ASKED THE WOOZY
THE WAR IS OVER AND PEACE IS DECLARED THERE WAS MUCH JOYFUL SHOUTING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE AND THE GATE WAS UNLOCKED AND THROWN WIDE OPEN SO THAT SCRAPS WAS ABLE TO REJOIN HER FRIENDS
SO TURNING HER HEAD TO SEE THAT NO ONE NOTICED HER SHE TOOK THE CLOVER FROM THE BASKET AND DROPPED IT INTO A GOLDEN VASE THAT STOOD ON DOROTHY'S TABLE
THAT'S IT HE CRIED WIPING AWAY THE TEARS AND SPRINGING TO HIS FEET WITH A SMILE
BUT NOT AS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AS THE SCARECROW JACK TURNED AT THIS TO EXAMINE THE SCARECROW CRITICALLY AND HIS OLD FRIEND SLYLY WINKED ONE PAINTED EYE AT HIM
THE MAGICIAN WANTS ME TO GET THREE HAIRS FROM THE END OF A WOOZY'S TAIL LET'S GO ON AND FIND SOME OTHER WOOZY SUGGESTED THE CAT
AND IF HE HAD NOT UNLAWFULLY KEPT THE BOTTLE OF LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION STANDING ON HIS SHELF THE ACCIDENT TO HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE AND TO UNC NUNKIE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED
AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL SEATED UPON THE LOGS HE LET GO AND AWAY IT FLOATED AND THE ADVENTURERS HAD BEGUN THEIR VOYAGE TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY
DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO LAND DOROTHY ASKED THE SCARECROW
I'M A VERY SWIFT RUNNER FOR I CAN OVERTAKE A HONEY-BEE AS IT FLIES
THE DOOR WAS REACHED BY A FLIGHT OF THREE STEPS AND THERE WAS A GOOD FLOOR ON WHICH WAS ARRANGED SOME FURNITURE THAT WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE
ONE WHERE THE LIGHT OF DAY NEVER PENETRATES
THINK HOW TIRED YOUR JAWS WOULD GET CHEWING A SQUARE MEAL LIKE THIS IF IT WERE NOT CONDENSED TO THE SIZE OF A SMALL TABLET--WHICH YOU CAN SWALLOW IN A JIFFY CHEWING ISN'T TIRESOME
BUT IF HE WIGGLES THAT WAY HE MAY TEAR HIS CLOTHES
ALSO ON THE SIDES OF THE PATHWAY LEADING UP TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CASTLE WERE ROWS OF TIN STATUARY VERY CLEVERLY EXECUTED
THE FARM FOLK REGARDED SCRAPS WITH MUCH CURIOSITY BUT NO GREAT ASTONISHMENT FOR THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE IN THE LAND OF OZ
WHAT'S WRONG ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE ONE OF ANSWERED DOROTHY
ANY MORE PLENTY REPLIED OJO
THAT MAKES A WAR WITH THEM DANGEROUS AND A DANGEROUS WAR CANNOT BE A PLEASANT ONE I SEE VERY CLEARLY REMARKED THE SCARECROW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE IN CONQUERING THOSE HORNERS--UNLESS WE HELP YOU OH CRIED THE HOPPERS IN A CHORUS
I AM VERY SHY BY NATURE AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED SO I HAVEN'T MINGLED MUCH IN SOCIETY ARE YOU AFRAID OF MEN INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
I'M GLAD OF IT FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO IN MY OFFICIAL CAPACITY REMARKED THE JAILER IN A PLEASED TONE
YOU'RE A NEW ONE TO ME DOROTHY SAID REFLECTIVELY ADDRESSING THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT IF YOU ENTERED ONE OF THEIR STIFF DWELLINGS YOU WOULD FIND IT BARE AND UNCOMFORTABLE AS ALL THEIR SHOW IS ON THE OUTSIDE
THEN OJO QUIETED HIMSELF AND TRIED TO THINK
THERE IS NO ONE TO MIND THE GATE AND LET PEOPLE THROUGH AND WE'VE NO KEY TO THE PADLOCK TRUE REPLIED OJO GOING A LITTLE NEARER TO PEEP THROUGH THE BARS OF THE GATE
I'M SORRY FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL THAT'S ALL OJO AND UNC NUNKIE SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE AND THE BOY WAS GLAD TO STAY BECAUSE HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE THE PATCHWORK GIRL BROUGHT TO LIFE
OR GIVE YOURSELF TO SOME LITTLE GIRL TO PLAY WITH
BUT JACK PREFERRED HIS PUMPKIN HOUSE AS IT MATCHED HIMSELF VERY WELL AND IN THIS HE WAS NOT SO STUPID AFTER ALL
I'M NEARLY AS LIGHT AS HE IS AND WHEN I'M ON TOP THE FENCE I'LL PULL OUR FRIEND OFF THE PICKET AND TOSS HIM DOWN TO YOU ALL RIGHT SAID THE CHAMPION AND HE PICKED UP THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THREW HER IN THE SAME MANNER HE HAD THE SCARECROW
I'M AS TIRED AS I WAS LAST NIGHT
TELL ME PHONY WHAT IS THIS RECORD LIKE WHICH YOU SAY YOU HAVE ON TAP IT'S A POPULAR SONG SIR
THERE'S A RAG-TIME TUNE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAID THE MACHINE
SO THE MAGICIAN LEANED OVER AND SHOOK FROM THE BOTTLE SOME GRAINS OF THE WONDERFUL POWDER AND THEY FELL DIRECTLY ON THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD AND ARMS
THEY ARE REALLY DELICIOUS
OJO WAS SORRY FOR HIM
THERE WERE BROAD BLUE FIELDS STRETCHING FOR MILES OVER THE VALLEY WHICH WAS DOTTED EVERYWHERE WITH PRETTY BLUE DOMED HOUSES NONE OF WHICH HOWEVER WAS VERY NEAR TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY STOOD
DID YOU COME TO US FOR ADVICE WHY WE CAME ANYHOW REPLIED SCRAPS AND NOW WE ARE HERE WE MAY AS WELL HAVE SOME ADVICE
BUT TELL ME GOOD SIR ARE YOU NOT A TRIFLE LUMPY YES OF COURSE
ALL READY ASKED DR PIPT
A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER SAID HE
LET US GO BACK A LITTLE WAY AND TALK THIS OVER SO THEY TURNED AND WENT AROUND THE BEND IN THE PASSAGE WHERE THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CAVE AND MISTER YOOP COULD NOT HEAR THEM
THE MUNCHKIN BOY HAS A LOYAL AND GENEROUS HEART AND HAS DONE HIS BEST TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE
IF YOU DON'T MIND PIPT OLD BOY I'LL CUT IT OUT AND TAKE A REST THE MAGICIAN LOOKED GLOOMILY AT THE MUSIC-MACHINE
BUT IT'S NOW SAFE IN THE LITTLE CRYSTAL VIAL YOU ARE VERY WELCOME TO IT INDEED SAID THE TIN WOODMAN
THAT WAY ANSWERED THE MAN POINTING WITH ONE HAND IT GOES INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES WHICH IS RULED BY THE TIN EMPEROR WHO MUST BE A MIGHTY MAGICIAN BECAUSE HE'S ALL MADE OF TIN AND YET HE'S ALIVE
HOWEVER I BELIEVE I SHALL LET YOU GO WITH OJO FOR MY POOR WIFE WILL NOT NEED YOUR SERVICES UNTIL SHE IS RESTORED TO LIFE
THE SOLDIER WORE A HANDSOME GREEN AND GOLD UNIFORM WITH A TALL HAT IN WHICH WAS A WAVING PLUME AND HE HAD A BELT THICKLY ENCRUSTED WITH JEWELS
THE TIN WOODMAN WANTED TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL WHERE DOROTHY HAD FOUND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SO BETWEEN THEM THE VISITORS TOLD THE STORY OF HOW SCRAPS WAS MADE AS WELL AS THE ACCIDENT TO MARGOLOTTE AND UNC NUNKIE AND HOW OJO HAD SET OUT UPON A JOURNEY TO PROCURE THE THINGS NEEDED FOR THE CROOKED MAGICIAN'S MAGIC CHARM
BUT WHEN THAT IS GONE WHAT SHALL WE EAT UNC THE OLD MAN SHIFTED IN HIS CHAIR BUT MERELY SHOOK HIS HEAD
YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET OZMA'S CONSENT SHE WOULDN'T KNOW IT DECLARED THE BOY
I MUST HAVE A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL WHAT KIND OF A WELL IS THAT SIR ASKED THE BOY
NAME THE FAVOR AND I WILL GRANT IT I--I WANT THREE HAIRS FROM THE TIP OF YOUR TAIL SAID OJO WITH SOME HESITATION
AT FIRST I THOUGHT SOME OF THOSE MISERABLE MUNCHKIN FARMERS HAD COME TO ANNOY ME BUT I AM RELIEVED TO FIND YOU IN THEIR STEAD
BUT I CAN'T CLIMB AT ALL AND I'M TOO BIG TO SQUEEZE BETWEEN THE BARS OF THE FENCE OJO TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO
MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE AND HIS CAN'T IS THIS TRUE INQUIRED THE SCARECROW TURNING TO THE MUNCHKIN BOY
THE PATCHWORK GIRL QUICKLY RECOVERING FROM HER FRIGHT NOW CAME NEARER AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF THE PEOPLE WITH DEEP INTEREST
HE PULLED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
THE MUSIC STOPPED AT THAT AND THE MACHINE TURNED ITS HORN FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND SAID WITH GREAT INDIGNATION
TOTO OF COURSE SLEPT BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS
I WANT IT TO BRING MY PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE OH
YES SHE ANSWERED
OUR WAY IS BARRED BY THIS GREAT WALL AND GATE
SUDDENLY HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THAT TREE A LONG TIME--AT LEAST FOR FIVE MINUTES--AND IT HAD REMAINED IN THE SAME POSITION ALTHOUGH THE BOY HAD CONTINUED TO WALK STEADILY ON
GOOD DAY
I SMELL DINNER I THINK YOU ARE MISTAKEN REPLIED THE SCARECROW
IF YOU DID YOU'D BE NO WISER THAN THEY ARE AH YES
IT'S FUNNY YOU AND I SHOULD LIVE HERE ALL ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST ISN'T IT YES SAID UNC
THEN WE MUST ASK THE SCARECROW THE SCARECROW
IT MADE THE AUTHOR RICH--FOR AN AUTHOR
THAT IS CHISS WHO CAUSES A LOT OF TROUBLE ALONG THIS ROAD WAS THE REPLY
BUT I WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT THE SCARECROW IS REALLY WISE
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE A GENERAL GROUNDWORK OF BLUE BUT HERE AND THERE OTHER COLORS GLINTED AT TIMES THROUGH THE BLUE--GORGEOUS YELLOWS TURNING TO PINK PURPLE ORANGE AND SCARLET MINGLED WITH MORE SOBER BROWNS AND GRAYS--EACH APPEARING AS A BLOTCH OR STRIPE ANYWHERE ON A LEAF AND THEN DISAPPEARING TO BE REPLACED BY SOME OTHER COLOR OF A DIFFERENT SHAPE
I'M NOT SURE
I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY REPLIED THE BOY
THEN HE TOLD HOW HE HAD SET OUT TO FIND THE FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH THE MAGICIAN NEEDED TO MAKE A CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE THE MARBLE FIGURES TO LIFE ONE REQUIREMENT BEING THREE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL
I AM MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE PATCHWORK GIRL
WHEN I START OUT ON MY TRAVELS SAID HE I CARRY ALONG ENOUGH SQUARE MEALS TO LAST ME SEVERAL WEEKS
IT WAS ONLY A PASSAGE WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO OF THEM TO WALK ABREAST--WITH TOTO IN BETWEEN THEM--AND IT HAD A HIGH ARCHED ROOF
GREAT FAVORITE AT THE ROYAL PALACE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YAWNING
NEITHER CAN I ANNOUNCED THE CAT
I MUST INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW WHEN HE CUT DOWN THE SECOND LEAF HE RESCUED THE GLASS CAT AND BUNGLE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE SCAMPERED AWAY LIKE A STREAK AND SOON HAD JOINED OJO WHEN SHE SAT BESIDE HIM PANTING AND TREMBLING
IN NO OTHER COUNTRY COULD IT BE DONE AT ALL
NO CAN'T I WHISTLE ASKED SCRAPS
HE IS QUITE RIGHT SAID OZMA WHO DID NOT SEEM A BIT SURPRISED
OH THEN YOU HAVE COME FROM THE CROOKED MAGICIAN ON THE MOUNTAIN
OR WHAT IS YOOP THE STRAW MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
I'M AN OLD TRAVELER AND HAVE FOUND THAT I NEVER GAIN ANYTHING BY BEING IN A HURRY
AND THE WOOZY OF COURSE WHY AS FOR ME OBSERVED THE WOOZY WHO WAS RECLINING ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS LEGS DOUBLED UNDER HIM SO THAT HE LOOKED MUCH LIKE A SQUARE BOX I HAVE NEVER SEEN THOSE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE YOU ARE SPEAKING OF AND YET I AM SORRY FOR THEM HAVING AT TIMES BEEN UNFORTUNATE MYSELF
IF YOU CAN KEEP THE WOOZY UNTIL YOU GET THE REST OF THE THINGS YOU NEED YOU CAN TAKE THE BEAST AND HIS THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND LET HIM FIND A WAY TO EXTRACT EM
THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WAS DANCING AROUND THE ROOM IN A FRENZY OF DESPAIR CALLING UPON HIS WIFE TO FORGIVE HIM TO SPEAK TO HIM TO COME TO LIFE AGAIN
NEVER MIND YOU'D BETTER
SHE ARCHED HER BACK A LITTLE AND SEEMED AFRAID
SHE CAN'T SEE VERY WELL BY DAY POOR THING
BUT I'VE GOT A NEEDLE AND THREAD IN THE KNAPSACK AND I'LL SEW YOU UP AGAIN DO SO HE BEGGED EARNESTLY AND AGAIN THE HOPPERS LAUGHED TO THE SCARECROW'S GREAT ANNOYANCE
I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY NEITHER CAN I
THIS IS THE LAST MEAL I SHALL HAVE TO COOK FOR SOME TIME FOR RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST DR PIPT HAS PROMISED TO BRING MY NEW SERVANT TO LIFE
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE TRICKS OF THIS ROAD BUT I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE AND DIDN'T REALIZE WHERE WE WERE IT WILL CARRY US BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED FROM PREDICTED OJO BEGINNING TO BE NERVOUS
BUT THEY WERE ALL JUST AS BEWILDERED AS SHE WAS AND AT FIRST NO ONE COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION
THE GIANT ROARED SO TERRIBLY THAT FOR A TIME THEY WERE AFRAID HE HAD BROKEN LOOSE
THE SCARECROW WHOM YOU SAY IS WISE TOLD ME I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE HE HAS EVER SEEN I KNOW
THE QUADLING MAN HAD TO HOLD THE LOG CRAFT FAST WHILE THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE FLOW OF THE RIVER WAS SO POWERFUL THAT IT NEARLY TORE THE RAFT FROM HIS HANDS
THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WAS WRONG TO MAKE THE GLASS CAT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL FOR IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW
TAKE IT EASY IS MY MOTTO
OTHER TOWERS WERE SET AT DISTANCES ALONG THE WALLS WHICH WERE BROAD ENOUGH FOR FOUR PEOPLE TO WALK ABREAST UPON
SO TO SWIM I'LL NEVER TRY TILL I FIND THE WATER DRY TRY TO CONTROL YOURSELF SCRAPS SAID OJO
FRANK BAUM
FRANK BAUM
HER LIFE WAS VERY PLEASANT NOW AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN MADE A PRINCESS OF OZ BY HER FRIEND OZMA SHE DID NOT CARE MUCH TO BE A PRINCESS AND REMAINED AS SWEET AS WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PLAIN DOROTHY GALE OF KANSAS
THEN SUDDENLY THEY GAVE A SHOUT ALL TOGETHER AND DISAPPEARED IN A FLASH INTO THEIR VARIOUS HOUSES THE TOPS OF WHICH CLOSED WITH A SERIES OF POPS THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BUNCH OF FIRECRACKERS BEING EXPLODED
THE GIRL'S UNCLE HENRY AND AUNT EM--THE ONLY RELATIVES SHE HAD IN THE WORLD--HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT HERE BY OZMA AND GIVEN A PLEASANT HOME
YOU JUST SAY KRIZZLE-KROO TO ME WILL THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY INQUIRED THE BOY
THE GLASS CAT WHICH DR PIPT LAWLESSLY MADE CONTINUED THE WIZARD IS A PRETTY CAT BUT ITS PINK BRAINS MADE IT SO CONCEITED THAT IT WAS A DISAGREEABLE COMPANION TO EVERYONE
HOOT-TI-TOOT-TI-TOOT CRIED THE OWL
SCRAPS FOLLOWED CLOSELY AFTER THE STRAW MAN AND THEN OJO AND DOROTHY TIMIDLY STEPPED INSIDE THE TUNNEL
THE ONLY BRAINS WORTH CONSIDERING ARE MINE WHICH ARE PINK
I DON'T WANT ANY WAR WITH THE HOPPERS FOR WARS BETWEEN NATIONS ALWAYS CAUSE HARD FEELINGS SO THE CHIEF AND DIKSEY AND SCRAPS LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT BACK TO THE MARBLE PICKET FENCE
THE GLASS CAT LAY ASLEEP ON ONE BED OJO WAS IN THE SECOND AND THE THIRD WAS NEATLY MADE UP AND SMOOTHED FOR THE DAY
FIDDLE-CUM-FOO HOWDY-DO
BUT COME IN AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT FOR YOU MUST HAVE TRAVELED FAR IN ORDER TO GET OUR LONELY PLACE WE HAVE REPLIED OJO AS HE AND UNC ENTERED THE HOUSE
OJO HOWEVER HAD KEPT HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE BODY OF THE TIN EMPEROR AND NOW HE NOTICED THAT UNDER THE JOINT OF HIS LEFT KNEE A TINY DROP OF OIL WAS FORMING
YOOP-TE-HOOP-TE-LOOP-TE-GOOP
HE MADE ME REPLIED THE CAT
OJO'S GOT A JOB YOU BET IS THE OWL SO VERY FOOLISH ASKED THE BOY
I ADVISE YOU ALL TO FOLLOW IT THE OWL HASN'T GIVEN US ANY ADVICE AS YET THE BOY DECLARED
THAT'S CERTAIN
BUT OF COURSE HE MEANT ON IT DIDN'T HE SAY WHAT THE HOPPERS AND HORNERS WERE LIKE INQUIRED DOROTHY
WHATEVER YOOP HAPPENS TO BE I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE HIM A CAPTIVE THAN RUNNING AROUND LOOSE SO HAD I AGREED THE SCARECROW WITH A NOD OF HIS PAINTED HEAD
THAT HAS ALMOST PUT AN END TO WICKED SORCERY IN OUR LAND SO YOU SEE THE LAW WAS NOT A FOOLISH ONE BUT WISE AND JUST
FOR A TIME HE SAW NOTHING HE RECOGNIZED BUT FINALLY HE CRIED
DOES THAT SUIT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
LONG AFTER HIS LITTLE NEPHEW WAS SOUND ASLEEP IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM THE OLD MAN SAT BY THE FIRE THINKING
IF I DIDN'T PUT FOOD INTO MY MOUTH AND EAT IT I WOULD GET HUNGRY AND STARVE
WHO IS THAT BRIGHT-COLORED DELICACY BEHIND YOU ME ASKED SCRAPS
ITS NOSE BEING IN THE CENTER OF A SQUARE SURFACE WAS FLAT WHILE THE MOUTH WAS FORMED BY THE OPENING OF THE LOWER EDGE OF THE BLOCK
MANY A SATIN RIBBON HAS A COTTON BACK SCRAPS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS BUT SHE HAD AN UNEASY MISGIVING THAT SHE HAD A COTTON BACK HERSELF
IN KANSAS SHE WAS DOROTHY GALE
WAIT FOR ME GOODNESS ME
FOR IF HE HAD HAPPENED TO BE LOOSE HE--HE PERHAPS IN THAT CASE HE WOULDN'T BE HUNGRY ANY MORE SAID OJO GRAVELY
BUT DON'T WORRY
THAT IS THE ONLY FEROCIOUS THING ABOUT ME ASSERTED THE WOOZY WITH EVIDENT PRIDE
I'VE NEARLY BEEN NICKED HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY AND IF THEY'RE GOING INTO DANGERS IT'S BEST FOR ME TO KEEP AWAY FROM THEM LET JELLIA JAMB KEEP HER TILL OJO RETURNS SUGGESTED DOROTHY
THAT SEEMED A GOOD IDEA
THEN HE BATHED IN AN ALABASTER POOL AND BRUSHED HIS SHAGGY HAIR AND WHISKERS THE WRONG WAY TO MAKE THEM STILL MORE SHAGGY
TAKE THAT YOU MONSTER IT CRIED ANGRILY
THEN LET'S GO AWAY AND VISIT THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY AND ITS JOLLY GOOD-NATURED PEOPLE
DID YOU SAY YOU WERE TRAVELING TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY YES REPLIED OJO
WHAT FOR ASKED THE WOODCHOPPER
THAT IS I EAT THEM WHEN I CAN GET THEM
YOU MUST GO INTO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE ROCKS AND CAVERNS ARE AND WHERE IS THAT ASKED OJO
BUT SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED BECAUSE THE PATH ENDED AND THERE WAS NO PLACE TO GO
ALL THESE CAME TO THE VACANT SPACE BEFORE THE THRONE AND STOOD FACING THE RULER
AFTER CONSULTING TOGETHER THEY DECIDED THAT OJO AND HIS PARTY SHOULD LEAVE THE VERY NEXT DAY TO SEARCH FOR THE GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL SO THEY NOW SEPARATED TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
A PATCHWORK GIRL
WHAT'S THE GAME ANYHOW--BLIND-MAN'S-BUFF ASKED SCRAPS
SO THERE SEEMED NO WAY OUT OF THEIR DILEMMA AND BEING HELPLESS THEY SIMPLY SAT STILL
YOU ASK ME WHY NOT
PERHAPS SEVERAL LONG JOURNEYS
SOME ARE AND SOME ARE NOT HE ANSWERED
WHAT DREADFUL LUCK HE WAILED DESPONDENTLY
MY BACK IS FLAT AND YOU CAN'T FALL OFF I THINK THE TROUBLE IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED SAID THE SCARECROW REGARDING THE WOOZY WITH MUCH WONDER FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A QUEER ANIMAL BEFORE
SCRAPS WANTED TO SHAKE THE WOMAN TO MAKE HER BEHAVE BUT DOROTHY TALKED TO HER IN A GENTLE TONE AND TOLD THE QUADLING'S WIFE SHE WAS A PRINCESS OF OZ AND A FRIEND OF OZMA AND THAT WHEN SHE GOT BACK TO THE EMERALD CITY SHE WOULD SEND THEM A LOT OF THINGS TO REPAY THEM FOR THE RAFT INCLUDING A NEW CLOTHESLINE
TO BE SURE HE SAID
NOT SO WELL REPLIED THE SCARECROW
I'M A SCARECROW A SCARECROW
WHAT AN ADMIRABLE YOUNG LADY YOU ARE AND WHAT JOLLY GOOD COMPANY
AT ONCE THE WOMAN MOVED TURNED HER HEAD WONDERINGLY THIS WAY AND THAT TO NOTE ALL WHO STOOD BEFORE HER AND SEEING DR PIPT RAN FORWARD AND THREW HERSELF INTO HER HUSBAND'S OUTSTRETCHED ARMS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SUCH IMPERTINENCE IT'S THE LATEST POPULAR SONG DECLARED THE PHONOGRAPH SPEAKING IN A SULKY TONE OF VOICE
AN OLD CROW ONCE TOLD ME I WAS VERY FASCINATING BUT OF COURSE THE BIRD MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
THEN OLD CHISS WON'T HAVE ANY LEFT TO THROW AT PEOPLE AH THAT'S A CLEVER IDEA
LET US SIT DOWN A WHILE AND HAVE A TALK AND GET ACQUAINTED HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ ASKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY
I SUPPOSE CHISS IS NOW QUITE DEAD WITH FRIGHT THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED MERRILY
CUT IT OUT VIC SHE SAID
SO THE SHAGGY MAN TRIED IT BUT PULL AS HARD AS HE COULD HE FAILED TO GET THE HAIRS OUT OF THE WOOZY'S TAIL
I WANT MY UNC NUNKIE HE EXCLAIMED
THE BODY OF THE GREAT PORCUPINE WAS NOW AS SMOOTH AS LEATHER EXCEPT FOR THE HOLES WHERE THE QUILLS HAD BEEN FOR IT HAD SHOT EVERY SINGLE QUILL IN THAT ONE WICKED SHOWER
LOOK OUT CRIED THE WOOZY
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID SHAKING HER HEAD THOUGHTFULLY
THEY'RE HARD TO GET
HAVING BAITED THE HOOK WITH SOME BREAD WHICH HE BROKE FROM HIS LOAF HE DROPPED THE LINE INTO THE WATER AND ALMOST INSTANTLY IT WAS SEIZED BY A GREAT FISH
BUT ONE THING THE HISTORIAN WAS SURE OF AND THAT WAS THAT THE POWERFUL SORCERESS GLINDA WOULD KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING AND THAT HE DESIRED TO COMMUNICATE WITH DOROTHY
I WISH YOU'D TELL ME HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALIVE THAT'S AN EASY JOB SAID SCRAPS SITTING UPON A BIG UPHOLSTERED CHAIR AND MAKING THE SPRINGS BOUNCE HER UP AND DOWN
IF I GROWLED AT THAT CREATURE YOU CALL CHISS IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY THINK THE WORLD HAD CRACKED IN TWO AND BUMPED AGAINST THE SUN AND MOON AND THAT WOULD CAUSE THE MONSTER TO RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS ITS LEGS COULD CARRY IT IN THAT CASE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO DO US ALL A GREAT FAVOR
THEN ONE SAID
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED THE TROUBLES AND ANNOYANCES OF YOUR LONG JOURNEY I DIDN'T MIND THE JOURNEY AT ALL SAID DOROTHY
YEARS AGO THERE WERE MANY WITCHES AND MAGICIANS IN THE LAND OF OZ AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY OFTEN USED IN MAKING THEIR MAGIC CHARMS AND TRANSFORMATIONS WAS A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
IT IS HIGH BUT I AM VERY LIGHT WE CAN TRY IT SAID THE HOPPER
WHY I--I DID GROWL RETORTED THE WOOZY WHO SEEMED MUCH ASTONISHED
IF A FEW BRAINS ARE GOOD MANY BRAINS MUST BE BETTER BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE EVENLY BALANCED SAID THE BOY AND I HAD NO TIME TO BE CAREFUL
YOU'VE ONLY ONE HEAD AND ONE BODY AND ONE NOSE AND MOUTH
HOW DO YOU INTEND TO GET THE BEAST OUT OF THIS FOREST THAT PUZZLED THEM ALL FOR A TIME
HE STOOD OJO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND PLACED SCRAPS JUST BEHIND HIM WITH HER PADDED HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS
I NEVER KNEW I WAS CALLED THE UNLUCKY SAID OJO SOBERLY
SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE MAGIC-MAKING OF DR PIPT AND HOW HE HAD BROUGHT THE GLASS CAT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE AND THE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE AND OF OJO'S QUEST AND HIS JOURNEY WITH DOROTHY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM REMARKED OJO
ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE LAND OF OZ IS FIT TO LIVE IN AND THAT'S THE EMERALD CITY
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO ORDER ME AROUND
ALL THE FURNITURE WAS MADE OF THE SAME GLORIOUS METAL AND SCRAPS ASKED WHAT IT WAS
I'VE SAGGED DOWN DREADFULLY FROM WALKING SO MUCH AND MEN LIKE TO SEE A STATELY FIGURE SHE THEN FELL UPON THE GROUND AND THE BOY ROLLED HER BACK AND FORTH LIKE A ROLLING-PIN UNTIL THE COTTON HAD FILLED ALL THE SPACES IN HER PATCHWORK COVERING AND THE BODY HAD LENGTHENED TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT
IN THE NEXT INSTANT HE REALIZED FROM THE WAY THE STRAW CRUNCHED BETWEEN HIS FINGERS THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE NON-EATABLE MAN BUT DURING THAT INSTANT OF DELAY DOROTHY AND OJO HAD SLIPPED BY THE GIANT AND WERE OUT OF REACH
I WOULD NOT PERMIT SUCH A WICKED DEED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OJO WAS ASTOUNDED AT HEARING THIS
NOT NOW
HE ONLY SAID THEY WERE TWO SEPARATE NATIONS AND THAT THE HORNERS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT WELL IF WE GO TO THEIR COUNTRY WE'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT EM SAID THE GIRL
I HOPE THE STRANGE FOOD WON'T GIVE ME INDIGESTION I HOPE NOT SAID OJO
HAVE YOU ANY NAME OF YOUR OWN I HAVE A FOOLISH NAME THAT MARGOLOTTE ONCE GAVE ME BUT WHICH IS QUITE UNDIGNIFIED FOR ONE OF MY IMPORTANCE ANSWERED THE CAT
GOOD EVENING COLONEL SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
BUT IT'S A QUEER ANIMAL WITH THREE HAIRS ON THE TIP OF ITS TAIL THAT WON'T COME OUT AND WHAT WON'T COME OUT ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
HE'S DIFFERENT FROM A REG'LAR PORCUPINE BECAUSE HE CAN THROW HIS QUILLS IN ANY DIRECTION WHICH AN AMERICAN PORCUPINE CANNOT DO
WE WILL GIVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY AND SET YOU FREE REALLY ASKED THE CHAMPION IN JOYOUS TONES
HERE THERE WAS NO PATH OF ANY SORT SO THEY ENTERED THE WOODS THE BOY LEADING THE WAY AND WANDERED THROUGH THE TREES UNTIL THEY WERE NEARLY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREST
THE WOMAN OF THIS HOUSE GOT HER NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SEWED UP THE HOLES MADE BY THE PORCUPINE QUILLS IN THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S BODY AFTER WHICH SCRAPS WAS ASSURED SHE LOOKED AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER
THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS OF ALL AND DOROTHY WAS UNCERTAIN AT FIRST WHETHER SCRAPS WAS REALLY ALIVE OR ONLY A DREAM OR A NIGHTMARE
THINKING IT BOTH UNFAIR AND UNKIND TO DEPRIVE HER OF ANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT WERE HANDY THE BOY TOOK DOWN EVERY BOTTLE ON THE SHELF AND POURED SOME OF THE CONTENTS IN MARGOLOTTE'S DISH
DON'T BE SILLY
HE WENT UP TO THE SORROWFUL MAN AND SAID SOFTLY
DR PIPT HAS ENCHANTED THE BREAD AND THE CHEESE SO IT WILL LAST ME ALL THROUGH MY JOURNEY HOWEVER MUCH I EAT WHY DO YOU PUT THOSE THINGS INTO YOUR MOUTH ASKED SCRAPS GAZING AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
JUST NOW I AM GOING TO CALL UPON AN OLD FRIEND--AN ORDINARY YOUNG LADY NAMED JINJUR--WHO HAS PROMISED TO REPAINT MY LEFT EAR FOR ME
THEN HE DREW A PAPER FROM HIS BREAST POCKET AND GLANCED AT IT
BUT THEY ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO MAKE A JOKE THEMSELVES THAT OLD BACHELOR WHO MADE THE RULES OUGHT TO BE SKINNED ALIVE DECLARED SCRAPS AND WOULD HAVE SAID MORE ON THE SUBJECT HAD NOT THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT A LITTLE HORNER MAN WHOM THE CHIEF INTRODUCED AS DIKSEY
IF YOU SAVE ONE YOU WILL SAVE THE OTHER FOR BOTH STAND THERE TOGETHER AND THE SAME COMPOUND WILL RESTORE THEM BOTH TO LIFE
A DOZEN STRONG MEN COULDN'T PULL OUT THOSE HAIRS
TRUE REPLIED UNC WITH A LOW CHUCKLE OF AMUSEMENT
I HATE WORK OF ANY KIND AND MAKING A RAFT IS HARD WORK I'LL GIVE YOU MY EM'RALD RING PROMISED THE GIRL
AND THERE'S THE BRAINY SCARECROW WITH A BODY STUFFED WITH STRAW WHO UTTERS WORDS OF WISDOM RARE THAT FILL US ALL WITH AWE
I'LL TRY
HE CRIED OUT TO THEM
HER PEARL TEETH WERE UNABLE TO CHEW THE BREAD AND BEYOND HER MOUTH THERE WAS NO OPENING
A PRISONER AT LAST
NAME'S EUREKA
THEY FOUND HER A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN THE SCARECROW BUT STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE TOSSED LIKE A SOFA-CUSHION AND THEY WERE ENJOYING THE SPORT IMMENSELY WHEN DOROTHY ANGRY AND INDIGNANT AT THE TREATMENT HER FRIENDS WERE RECEIVING RUSHED AMONG THE TOTTENHOTS AND BEGAN SLAPPING AND PUSHING THEM UNTIL SHE HAD RESCUED THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND HELD THEM CLOSE ON EITHER SIDE OF HER
THE SCARECROW WAS STILL STUCK ON THE TOP OF HIS PICKET BUT HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE
NOTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE LAND OF OZ ESCAPES THE NOTICE OF OUR WISE SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD
OZMA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND WAS THOUGHTFUL FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE BOY HAD FINISHED SPEAKING
I PROMISED OJO TO HELP HIM FIND THE THINGS HE WANTS AND I'LL STICK TO MY PROMISE VERY WELL REPLIED OZMA
HALF THE FOOLS AND ALL THE WISE FOLKS ARE DIGNIFIED AND I'M NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER SHE'S JUST CRAZY EXPLAINED THE GLASS CAT
PLANKED WHITEFISH OMELET WITH JELLY OR MUTTON-CHOPS WITH GRAVY OJO THOUGHT ABOUT IT
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
I CAN SEE ITS TURRETS GLITTERING IN THE SUN
THEY COULD SEE NOTHING AROUND THEM FOR THE ROCKS BESIDE THEIR PATH WERE HIGHER THAN THEIR HEADS
THE WALLS WERE PANELED WITH TIN AND FROM THE TIN CEILING HUNG TIN CHANDELIERS
I'VE WANDERED THROUGH YOUR GARDENS AND IN THE FOREST UNTIL I'M TIRED OF IT ALL AND WHEN I COME INTO THE HOUSE THE CONVERSATION OF YOUR FAT WIFE AND OF YOURSELF BORES ME DREADFULLY THAT IS BECAUSE I GAVE YOU DIFFERENT BRAINS FROM THOSE WE OURSELVES POSSESS--AND MUCH TOO GOOD FOR A CAT RETURNED DR PIPT
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE JOKING HORNERS IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY LEFT THE PASSAGE AND CAME TO A GREAT CAVE SO HIGH THAT IT MUST HAVE REACHED NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WITHIN WHICH IT LAY
NO ONE CAN BE UNLUCKY WHO HAS THE INTELLIGENCE TO DIRECT HIS OWN ACTIONS
HE HAD KINDLY EYES BUT HE HADN'T SMILED OR LAUGHED IN SO LONG THAT THE BOY HAD FORGOTTEN THAT UNC NUNKIE COULD LOOK ANY OTHER WAY THAN SOLEMN
THERE WERE ALMOST TOO MANY PATCHES ON THE FACE OF THE GIRL FOR HER TO BE CONSIDERED STRICTLY BEAUTIFUL FOR ONE CHEEK WAS YELLOW AND THE OTHER RED HER CHIN BLUE HER FOREHEAD PURPLE AND THE CENTER WHERE HER NOSE HAD BEEN FORMED AND PADDED A BRIGHT YELLOW
WHILE THEY WAITED HERE OJO SPIED A LONG BROKEN BRANCH LYING UPON THE BANK SO HE LEAPED ASHORE AND GOT IT
WHO IS YOOP
WHEN DOROTHY HAD PATTED THE STRAW MAN INTO SHAPE AGAIN HE DECLARED HE FELT AS GOOD AS NEW AND EQUAL TO FURTHER ADVENTURES
NO NO EXCLAIMED THE MAGICIAN
I S'POSE WE CAN GO BACK THE WAY WE CAME TO JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S HOUSE AND THEN TURN INTO THE WINKIE COUNTRY
HOWEVER MUCH HE BROKE OFF FROM THE SLICE IT REMAINED EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE
ONE WHOLE SHELF WAS MARKED
THEN SAID SCRAPS THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERSTANDING YOU MEANT LED TO THE MISUNDERSTANDING EXACTLY
WHO CARES FOR THE OUTSIDE OF ANYTHING ASKED THE CHIEF
BUT CHISS WON'T EXPECT IT AND IT WILL SCARE HIM AWAY THE WOOZY HESITATED
OJO ALSO HAD BROUGHT ALONG HIS BASKET TO WHICH OZMA HAD ADDED A BOTTLE OF SQUARE MEAL TABLETS AND SOME FRUIT
IN THE MAGNIFICENT EMERALD THRONE WHICH SPARKLED WITH COUNTLESS JEWELS SAT OZMA OF OZ IN HER ROBE OF STATE WHICH WAS EMBROIDERED WITH EMERALDS AND PEARLS
RICH BUT SHAGGY LACES WERE AT HIS THROAT
THEY DID NOT CLOSE THE HOLE IN THE ROOF BUT LEFT IT OPEN TO ADMIT AIR
I THINK I DO MOST MIGHTY MAGICIAN REPLIED THE QUADLING BOWING LOW
DO YOU MEAN THE PINK PEBBLES YOU CALL YOUR BRAINS AND YOUR RED HEART AND GREEN EYES ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
OJO FOLLOWED AND FOUND IT MORE EASY THAN HE HAD EXPECTED
OJO AND I ARE NOT AFRAID
ANYTHING IMPORTANT BILLINA HAS HATCHED OUT THIRTEEN NEW CHICKENS REPLIED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS AND THEY'RE THE CUTEST LITTLE FLUFFY YELLOW BALLS YOU EVER SAW
AND THIS BEING THE PRISON AND YOU THE JAILER IT IS MY DUTY TO PLACE THE PRISONER IN YOUR CHARGE TRUE
CHAPTER THREE THE PATCHWORK GIRL OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
SO I'M HUNGRY HAVEN'T YOU EATEN ANYTHING IN MANY YEARS ASKED DOROTHY
ARE WE OJO I AM A LITTLE THE BOY ADMITTED
YET ALL THREE WOULD BE WELCOME TO LIVE IN OZMA'S PALACE IF THEY CARED TO
WHAT NAME OJO THE UNLUCKY ANSWERED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
TELL US GOOD QUADLING HOW WE CAN GET ACROSS THE RIVER I DON'T KNOW REPLIED THE QUADLING
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER POPPED OUT OF THE CIRCULAR POT-LIKE DWELLING WHILE FROM ALL THE OTHER BLACK OBJECTS CAME POPPING MORE CREATURES--VERY LIKE JUMPING-JACKS WHEN THEIR BOXES ARE UNHOOKED--UNTIL FULLY A HUNDRED STOOD GATHERED AROUND OUR LITTLE GROUP OF TRAVELERS
AMUSE YOURSELF WHILE I'M GONE
THEN SHE WHISPERED TO OJO
WHEN HE HAD STRIPPED OFF THE SIDE SHOOTS HE BELIEVED HE COULD USE THE BRANCH AS A POLE TO GUIDE THE RAFT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
AND THEN AS THE PHONOGRAPH OVERTOOK THEM THE GLASS CAT ADDED STERNLY
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT
THE HOUSE OF THIS INTERESTING CREATION STOOD IN THE CENTER OF A VAST PUMPKIN-FIELD WHERE THE VINES GREW IN PROFUSION AND BORE PUMPKINS OF EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH WERE SMALLER
WHAT ABOUT THE SCARECROW SHE ASKED DOROTHY
BE CAREFUL OR YOU'LL FALL IN THE WATER WARNED OJO
LISTEN
WELL HERE IS A PLACE TO GET ALL THE ADVICE WE WANT MAYBE MORE THAN WE NEED
JUST NOTICE THAT ROCK SCRAPS LOOKED DOWN AT HER FEET AND SAID
SHE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND THE HOUSE NOW A GLASS CAT EXCLAIMED OJO ASTONISHED
OHO CRIED LITTLE DIKSEY
HEIGHT 21 FEET.--(AND YET HE HAS BUT 2 FEET WEIGHT 1640 POUNDS.--(BUT HE WAITS ALL THE TIME AGE 400 YEARS AND UP AS THEY SAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE ADVERTISEMENTS TEMPER FIERCE AND FEROCIOUS.--(EXCEPT WHEN ASLEEP APPETITE RAVENOUS.--(PREFERS MEAT PEOPLE AND ORANGE MARMALADE STRANGERS APPROACHING THIS CAVE DO SO AT THEIR OWN PERIL
IT'S SUCH HARD WORK TO CHEW WHEN YOU EAT I'LL GIVE YOU SIX OF THOSE TABLETS IF YOU'LL HELP US MAKE A RAFT PROMISED THE SCARECROW
HE HAD BUT ONE LEG SET JUST BELOW THE MIDDLE OF HIS ROUND FAT BODY
IN SPITE OF THESE PAUSES THEY WERE REALLY MAKING GOOD PROGRESS TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND HAVING FOUND A WAY TO CONQUER THE ADVERSE CURRENT THEIR SPIRITS ROSE CONSIDERABLY
ONE WHO SERVES
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE A TALKING-MACHINE IS SUPPOSED TO TALK AND MAKE A NOISE--AND SOMETIMES MUSIC
ITS HEAD WAS AN EXACT SQUARE LIKE ONE OF THE BUILDING-BLOCKS A CHILD PLAYS WITH
THIS IS PRETTY HARD LUCK SAID OJO IN A DISCOURAGED VOICE
AND SO NICE AND POLITE ADDED SCRAPS BOBBING HER HEAD
THEREFORE SHE PUTS HIM IN PRISON TO MAKE HIM STRONG AND BRAVE
BUT HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED OZMA IN THE FACE SAYING
THEN THOSE TABLETS WOULD BE FINE FOR A LAZY MAN
THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND ARRAYED IN HIS SPLENDID SHAGGY GARMENTS HE WENT TO OZMA'S BANQUET HALL AND FOUND THE SCARECROW THE WIZARD AND DOROTHY ALREADY ASSEMBLED THERE
WHILE THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED IN EATING THE GOOD WOMAN SAID
NOT THE SHAGGY MAN NO
THEN HE COULD WALK AWAY WITH US EASILY BEING FREE AH I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT PLAN OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FREE LONG AGO SAID THE WOOZY
S'POSE WE GO THIS WAY SUGGESTED DOROTHY
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT VIC SHE ADDED AS SHE SMOOTHED OUT HER APRON AND PUT IT ON AGAIN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER YOU'VE MISSED YOUR GUESS
AND ALTHOUGH THAT IS A BARBAROUS COUNTRY THERE ARE NO BARBERS THERE WHO IS THE DWARF ASKED THE CAT
A VERY REFINED AND EDUCATED GENTLEMAN NAMED THE SCARECROW WHOM I MET TOLD ME I AM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURE IN ALL OZ AND I BELIEVE IT OH
ALL THIS FUSS IS ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL SHE SAID FACING OZMA UNABASHED
OZMA WILL SEE HIM BOUT IT OF COURSE AND THEN SHE'LL PUNISH HIM
OLD MARGOLOTTE MEANT TO GIVE YOU ONLY A FEW--JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU GOING--BUT WHEN SHE WASN'T LOOKING I ADDED A GOOD MANY MORE OF THE BEST KINDS I COULD FIND IN THE MAGICIAN'S CUPBOARD THANKS SAID THE GIRL DANCING ALONG THE PATH AHEAD OF OJO AND THEN DANCING BACK TO HIS SIDE
YOU DON'T WANT WAR DO YOU NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT ADMITTED JAK HORNER
BEWARE A WOOZY
ANYHOW MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE
AH THAT IS INDEED A LUCKY NUMBER REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN
THE BOY FELL AGAINST THE HORNER SO THAT ALL WENT TUMBLING DOWN THE SLIDE IN A REGULAR MIX-UP UNABLE TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE GOING BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS
WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS YOU ARE TO FIND ONE SAID OJO IS A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER YOU OUGHT TO FIND THAT IN THE FIELDS AROUND THE EMERALD CITY SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
MY ORDERS WILL BEAT THE BAND AFTERWARD THE PHONOGRAPH WAS NOW PLAYING A STIRRING MARCH TUNE AND THE MAGICIAN UNLOCKED HIS CABINET AND TOOK OUT THE GOLD BOTTLE CONTAINING THE POWDER OF LIFE
THERE'S A FENCE BETWEEN THE HOPPER COUNTRY AND THE HORNER COUNTRY AND A GATE IN THE FENCE
THEN THERE WILL BE PEACE AGAIN AND NO NEED TO FIGHT THEY READILY AGREED TO THIS AND RETURNED TO THE FENCE LAUGHING AS LOUD AND AS HARD AS THEY COULD ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE LAUGHING A BIT
HOW CAN WE GET HIM DOWN MR CHAMPION THE CHAMPION SHOOK HIS HEAD
AH SAID THE SCARECROW WHO WAS LEADING THE WAY WE MUST BE NEAR YOOP JUST THEN AS HE ROUNDED A SHARP TURN THE STRAW MAN STOPPED SO SUDDENLY THAT ALL THE OTHERS BUMPED AGAINST HIM
TOTO WAS USUALLY A WELL BEHAVED DOG BUT THIS TIME HE WAS ANGRY AND SNAPPED AT THE MAN'S LEG AGAIN AND AGAIN
SO HE TOOK A BOOK FROM THE CASE AND SAT DOWN IN A BIG CHAIR TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES
IN THIS YELLOW COUNTRY AND WITH YOUR KIND ASSISTANCE THAT OUGHT TO BE VERY EASY TO FIND THE TIN WOODMAN STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
ALL RIGHT SAID DOROTHY
ALL AROUND WAS INTENSE SILENCE
HE FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS VERY WILLINGLY ANXIOUS THAT HIS FATE MIGHT BE DECIDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
WHENEVER IT IS SPRINKLED ON ANYTHING THAT THING WILL AT ONCE COME TO LIFE NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO LIVES ON THE MOUNTAIN ASKED DOROTHY
NO ANSWERED THE WOOZY FOR I HAVE NO CLAWS
BUT YOU'D BETTER NOT VISIT THEM
AT LAST YOU HAVE TOLD ME SOMETHING IS THAT THE EXTENT OF YOUR WISDOM ASKED SCRAPS
DOROTHY TOLD THE GIRL RULER HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY HAD BEEN IN THEIR QUEST UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE ITEM OF THE YELLOW BUTTERFLY WHICH THE TIN WOODMAN POSITIVELY REFUSED TO SACRIFICE TO THE MAGIC POTION
IF HE WANTS ME LET HIM COME HERE AND GET ME
HERE SAT A JOLLY LITTLE MAN RICHLY DRESSED IN GREEN AND HAVING AROUND HIS NECK A HEAVY GOLD CHAIN TO WHICH A NUMBER OF GREAT GOLDEN KEYS WERE ATTACHED
YOU CAN'T PROVE HE PICKED THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER SO YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO ACCUSE HIM OF IT
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SCRAPS ASKED OJO
DOESN'T YOUR STRAW EVER BUNCH OH I'M STUFFED WITH COTTON SAID SCRAPS
P.S.--DON'T FEED THE GIANT YOURSELF VERY WELL SAID OJO WITH A SIGH
THERE IS ONE OTHER COMPOUND THAT WOULD DESTROY THE MAGIC SPELL OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION AND RESTORE MY WIFE AND UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE SAID HE
BUT SURELY SIR A SCARECROW CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING MOST SCARECROWS DON'T I ADMIT ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN
THEY HAD PROCEEDED IN THIS WAY FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHEN A TWINKLING BLUE LIGHT APPEARED AHEAD OF THEM
I DON'T THINK WE NEED BE AFRAID WHEN WE GET TO THE EMERALD CITY FOR UNC NUNKIE HAS TOLD ME THAT OZMA OUR GIRL RULER IS VERY LOVELY AND KIND AND TRIES TO HELP EVERYONE WHO IS IN TROUBLE
GROWING BETWEEN THEM I CAN SEE LOVELY FERNS AND WILD-FLOWERS AND SOFT GREEN MOSSES
HAVE YOUR OWN WAY SHE SAID
AFTER A TIME THEY REPASSED THE QUADLING HOUSE AND THE MAN WAS STILL STANDING ON THE BANK
AND WE'VE A HUNGRY TIGER WHO WOULD BABIES LOVE TO EAT BUT NEVER DOES BECAUSE WE FEED HIM OTHER KINDS OF MEAT
THE NEXT THING IS THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY FOR THAT YOU MUST GO TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY THE SHAGGY MAN DECLARED
HE BELIEVED THE ROCK WOULD PREVENT THEIR FLOATING BACKWARD WITH THE CURRENT AND SO IT DID
SO THERE IS LITTLE WONDER THAT THE PULSES OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY BEAT FAST AS HE AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD FACING THE CAVE
BUT THEY SAY THERE ARE MANY DANGERS LURKING ON THE ROAD TO THE GREAT FAIRY CITY AND SO WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL I HOPE NOTHING WILL BREAK ME SAID THE GLASS CAT IN A NERVOUS VOICE
THEN THE WIZARD MADE THE MAGIC PASS AND SPOKE THE MAGIC WORD BEFORE THE STATUE OF UNC NUNKIE
WELL PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT SIR SAID SHE AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE DOWN THE BOTTLE WHEN THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SUDDENLY CALLED TO HER EXCITEDLY FROM THE FIREPLACE
HE CAUTIOUSLY OPENED ONE OF THE DOORS AND FOUND IT LED INTO A HALLWAY
IS ANYBODY HURT NOT ME ANSWERED THE SCARECROW
HE HAS BEEN AT IT A LONG LONG WHILE AND SO I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE THE GIRL
YOU MUST HAVE TRAVELED IN YOUR TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE SO OLD
BUT I CAME HERE ONCE WITH DOROTHY AND OZMA LET ME STAY HOW DO YOU LIKE OZ ASKED SCRAPS
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO DO IT DIKSEY I DON'T KNOW SAID DIKSEY MODESTLY
DOROTHY SAID SHE BELIEVED THE WOOZY WAS A GOOD BEAST HONEST AND FAITHFUL
WHY I'M NOT SO LITTLE AS I USED TO BE ANSWERED THE BOY EARNESTLY
WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE EMERALD CITY I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN CONTINUED THE SCARECROW
I HAD AN IDEA SAID HE THAT PRISONERS WERE ALWAYS TREATED HARSHLY TO PUNISH THEM THAT WOULD BE DREADFUL CRIED TOLLYDIGGLE
I DO THAT MYSELF
POOR WOOZ SAID HE
ALTHOUGH THE STRAW MAN DID NOT EAT NOT BEING MADE SO HE COULD HE OFTEN DINED WITH OZMA AND HER COMPANIONS MERELY FOR THE PLEASURE OF TALKING WITH THEM
THAT BEATS BEING FENCED UP IN A LONELY FOREST AND STARVED AS FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL RESUMED THE WIZARD SHE IS SO REMARKABLE IN APPEARANCE AND SO CLEVER AND GOOD TEMPERED THAT OUR GRACIOUS RULER INTENDS TO PRESERVE HER CAREFULLY AS ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES OF THE CURIOUS LAND OF OZ
CHAPTER TWO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN JUST AT DAWN NEXT MORNING UNC NUNKIE LAID HIS HAND TENDERLY ON OJO'S HEAD AND AWAKENED HIM
WHAT THAT LITTLE SQUEAK SHE CRIED
I HAVE SENT FOR HIM AND HAD HIM BROUGHT TO THIS PALACE WHERE HE NOW IS AND HIS FOUR KETTLES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND HIS BOOK OF RECIPES BURNED UP
BUT I SING LIKE A BIRD RAVEN OR CROW ASKED THE GLASS CAT
WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU DOING ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN
AND THEY'RE NOT RIPE YET
THOSE HOLES DO NOT LOOK BADLY AT ALL THEY'LL LET IN THE AIR AND I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M AIRY OR THAT I'VE BEEN STUCK UP SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THE SONG WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
JUST NOW I AM ORDERED TO TAKE HIM TO PRISON
IT WAS DR PIPT'S FAMOUS POWDER OF LIFE THAT ENABLED ME TO BECOME THE RULER OF OZ I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT STORY SAID THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKING AT OZMA QUESTIONINGLY
I WISH YOU WOULD PROVE IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE RETURNED THE BEAST
WE CAN'T BE SHUT UP HERE ALL NIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS OUR TIME TO PLAY
BUT WE'VE NEVER SPOKEN BECAUSE NEITHER OF US HAS EVER CROSSED OVER THAT'S QUEER SAID THE SCARECROW
ONE OF HIS LEGS IS RIPPED TOO SHE EXCLAIMED
NOW THEN SAID THE WOMAN BRISKLY I MUST GET YOU SOME SUPPER FOR YOU ARE DOUBTLESS HUNGRY
I WAS AFRAID OF THAT DECLARED THE BEAST
YOU AND OJO MUST GATHER UP THE QUILLS WHILE I HOLD CHISS A PRISONER
WAIT A MINUTE AND I'LL TIE A STRING TO YOU
DOWN WENT ALL THREE AGAIN IN A HEAP WITH SCRAPS ON TOP
COURSE IT IS ANSWERED DOROTHY
I MEAN YOU IF YOU MUST KNOW IT GROWLED THE CAT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS A ROUND TABLE ON WHICH BREAKFAST WAS ALREADY PLACED SMOKING HOT
I THINK I CAN WALK AS FAR AND AS FAST THROUGH THE WOODS AS YOU CAN UNC
LET'S GO TO SLEEP OR SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO US ANSWERED THE GLASS CAT
YOU ARE QUITE WRONG MY POOR BEAST SAID THE SHAGGY MAN IN A TONE OF PITY
BUT WE CAN FIND OUT SO AS SOON AS THE SCARECROW WAS MENDED THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH DIKSEY TO THE MINE
BUT YOU ARE WRONG SAID SCRAPS
IT'S ENOUGH TO DRIVE A CRAZY LADY MAD MURMURED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
AND SO IF WE HAD A BOAT OR A RAFT THE RIVER WOULD FLOAT US THERE MORE QUICKLY AND MORE EASILY THAN WE COULD WALK THAT IS TRUE AGREED DOROTHY
WHEREAS IF YOU MAKE A FRIEND OF OZMA SHE WILL GLADLY ASSIST YOU
THE WALLS WERE OF POLISHED MARBLE WHITE WITH VEINS OF DELICATE COLORS RUNNING THROUGH IT AND THE ROOF WAS ARCHED AND FANTASTIC AND BEAUTIFUL
WHY YOU'RE ALL SEAMS MY GIRL SAID THE CHIEF
BUT IF YOU CAN PROVE OJO IS INNOCENT THEY WILL SET HIM FREE AT ONCE THEY'LL HAVE TO PROVE HIM GUILTY WON'T THEY ASKED SCRAPS
OH WHAT LOVELY TREES THEY WERE CERTAINLY PRETTY TO LOOK UPON AND THE TRAVELERS HURRIED FORWARD TO OBSERVE THEM MORE CLOSELY
BUT THAT REMINDS ME CAPTAIN--OR KING I AM CHIEF OF THE HORNERS AND MY NAME IS JAK OF COURSE
I AM PERHAPS THE STRONGEST MAN IN MY COUNTRY SO I'LL UNDERTAKE TO DO THE THROWING
BUT HERE IS A HOUSE BY THE ROADSIDE SO WHY GO FARTHER WHERE IS THE HOUSE BUNGLE JUST HERE BESIDE US SCRAPS OJO WAS NOW ABLE TO SEE A SMALL HOUSE NEAR THE PATHWAY
MY WIFE SAYS I'M THE LAZIEST MAN IN ALL OZ AND SHE IS A TRUTHFUL WOMAN
FOR IF THERE IS DANGER YOU CAN CLIMB A TREE
SO I'LL GIVE YOU A LAST WORD OF ADVICE
YOU PULL THE HAIR AND I'LL PULL YOU AND TOGETHER WE OUGHT TO GET IT OUT EASILY WAIT A JIFFY CALLED THE WOOZY AND THEN IT WENT TO A TREE AND HUGGED IT WITH ITS FRONT PAWS SO THAT ITS BODY COULDN'T BE DRAGGED AROUND BY THE PULL
JUST NOW I REGRET TO SAY MY SEEDS ARE RATTLING A BIT SO I MUST SOON GET ANOTHER HEAD OH
WE NEVER GO TO WAR WITH THEM IF WE CAN HELP IT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR DANGEROUS HORNS
AS THEY PROCEEDED THE WALLS OF ROCK ON EITHER SIDE GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER
THE CHISS IS COWARDLY I'M SURE AND IF IT EVER HEARD MY AWFUL TERRIBLE FRIGHTFUL GROWL IT WOULD BE SCARED STIFF OH
JUST RUN AHEAD AND SHOW US THE WAY
THESE SAID THE CHIEF ARE MY SWEET DAUGHTERS
GO AHEAD OJO GRASPED THE HAIR WITH BOTH HANDS AND PULLED WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH WHILE SCRAPS SEIZED THE BOY AROUND HIS WAIST AND ADDED HER STRENGTH TO HIS
HE SAID TO HER
AROUND THE GROUNDS OF THE CASTLE RAN A TIN WALL WITH TIN GATES
MAY I STAY HERE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE I GO TO PRISON ASKED THE BOY PLEADINGLY
THIS PROMISE PLEASED THE WOMAN AND SHE SOON BECAME MORE PLEASANT SAYING THEY COULD STAY THE NIGHT AT HER HOUSE AND BEGIN THEIR VOYAGE ON THE RIVER NEXT MORNING
LITTLE JACK HORNER
MY PEOPLE LIVE IN A GREAT CITY NOT FAR FROM HERE
AND I UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE UNDERSTANDS ME JUST AS WELL AS IF HE COULD TALK TOTO AT THIS GOT UP AND RUBBED HIS HEAD SOFTLY AGAINST DOROTHY'S HAND WHICH SHE HELD OUT TO HIM AND HE LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE AS IF HE HAD UNDERSTOOD EVERY WORD SHE HAD SAID
IF THEY WERE LEFT ALONE THESE CREATURES NEVER TROUBLED THE INHABITANTS OF THE REST OF OZ BUT THOSE WHO INVADED THEIR DOMAINS ENCOUNTERED MANY DANGERS FROM THEM
THE PEOPLE JOYFULLY CHEERED THE APPEARANCE OF THE TIN WOODMAN THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY WHO WERE ALL THREE GENERAL FAVORITES AND ON ENTERING THE ROYAL PALACE WORD CAME TO THEM FROM OZMA THAT SHE WOULD AT ONCE GRANT THEM AN AUDIENCE
THE ADVENTURERS NOW FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE AND DOROTHY ASKED ANXIOUSLY
AT THIS MOMENT A PATTER OF FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD AND LOOKING UP THEY SAW THE LIVE PHONOGRAPH STANDING BEFORE THEM
BUT THEY STAYED OUTSIDE THE HOUSE UNDER THE BRIGHT STARS AND TALKED IN LOW TONES SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE SLEEPERS
WE HATE THE SUN AND FROM IT RUN THE MOON IS COOL AND CLEAR SO ON THIS SPOT EACH TOTTENHOT WAITS FOR IT TO APPEAR
AND THAT MEANS WE MUST KEEP TO THE LEFT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GO DOWN THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE THEY FOUND ANY PATH THAT LED IN THE DIRECTION THEY WANTED TO GO BUT AMONG THE TUMBLED ROCKS AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS A FAINT TRAIL WHICH THEY DECIDED TO FOLLOW
IT HUNG ITS HEAD A MOMENT AS IF IN SHAME OR SORROW BUT THEN IT SAID WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE
WHILE THE LITTLE GIRL WAS RELATING THESE ADVENTURES THE TIN WOODMAN SAT IN AN EASY CHAIR LISTENING WITH INTENSE INTEREST WHILE THE OTHERS SAT GROUPED AROUND HIM
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THAT DREADFUL THING LIVE SHE ASKED
WE FOUND THE WOOZY EXPLAINED THE BOY AND HE AGREED TO GIVE US THE THREE HAIRS
JUST ORDINARY KITTEN THEN IT CAN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH
NOT THE SNAP OF A FINGER FOR I HAVE NO HEART SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
SO I SLIPPED OUT OF THE HOUSE WHILE THE MAGICIAN WAS STIRRING HIS FOUR KETTLES AND I'VE BEEN RUNNING AFTER YOU ALL NIGHT
TRY NOT TO GET RIPPED OR YOUR STUFFING MAY FALL OUT
WHAT'S FUNNY INQUIRED THE SCARECROW STERNLY
BACK THERE IN THE WOODS NOTHING UNUSUAL EVER HAPPENED
YET I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE CROWS USUALLY AVOID THE SCARECROW WHO IS A VERY HONEST FELLOW IN HIS WAY BUT STUFFED
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE GORGEOUS DECLARED OZMA
OZMA SAT LOOKING AT THE PRISONER A LONG TIME
THE FLOOR OF THE TUNNEL WAS DIFFICULT TO WALK UPON BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN WORN SMOOTH AS GLASS AND PRETTY SOON SCRAPS WHO WAS SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THE OTHERS SLIPPED AND FELL HEAD FOREMOST
THE BUTTERFLIES ARE AMONG THE PRETTIEST OF ALL CREATED THINGS AND THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO PAIN
IF I GIVE UP THOSE THREE HAIRS I--I'M JUST A BLOCKHEAD YET I MUST HAVE THEM INSISTED THE BOY FIRMLY AND HE THEN TOLD THE WOOZY ALL ABOUT THE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE AND HOW THE THREE HAIRS WERE TO BE A PART OF THE MAGIC CHARM THAT WOULD RESTORE THEM TO LIFE
IT'S SO MUCH MORE GRACEFUL AND AGREEABLE THAN WALKING I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE SCARECROW
WHAT WEAPONS DO YOU FIGHT WITH THE SCARECROW ASKED
EVEN THE LONG GRAY BEARD WAS SOLID MARBLE
SO YOU SEE HAD NOT OLD MOMBI BROUGHT HOME THE POWDER OF LIFE I MIGHT NEVER HAVE RUN AWAY FROM HER AND BECOME OZMA OF OZ NOR WOULD WE HAVE HAD JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE SAWHORSE TO COMFORT AND AMUSE US THAT STORY INTERESTED THE SHAGGY MAN VERY MUCH AS WELL AS THE OTHERS WHO HAD OFTEN HEARD IT BEFORE
YOU ARE TO BE ARRESTED FOR WILLFULLY BREAKING ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ BREAKING A LAW SAID SCRAPS
SO WE HAD TO BRING THE WOOZY ALONG WITH US I SEE RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THE STORY
AND MY HEARING IS NOW PERFECT
VERY CAREFULLY HE PLACED THE POWDER OF LIFE IN THE GOLD BOTTLE AND THEN LOCKED IT UP IN A DRAWER OF HIS CABINET
SEEING THE NEXT MOMENT THAT SHE WAS HARMLESS THE PEOPLE SLOWLY RETURNED AND GATHERED AROUND THE PATCHWORK GIRL REGARDING HER WITH ASTONISHMENT
IT WON'T DO THAT FOR I KNOW A TRICK TO BEAT THIS TRICKY ROAD
I MIGHT SEARCH FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS AND NEVER FIND ANOTHER SIX-LEAVED CLOVER HE TOLD HIMSELF AND QUICKLY PLUCKING THE STEM FROM THE PLANT HE PLACED THE PRIZED CLOVER IN HIS BASKET COVERING IT WITH THE OTHER THINGS HE CARRIED THERE
THERE WERE TIN TREES TOO AND HERE AND THERE SHADY BOWERS OF TIN WITH TIN BENCHES AND CHAIRS TO SIT UPON
WITH HIS HANDS THE BOY FELT OF THE BED AND FOUND IT WAS BIG AND SOFT WITH FEATHER PILLOWS AND PLENTY OF BLANKETS
AND STILL THE MUSIC PLAYED
NO SAID THE MAN
RUB IT ON THE HOLES IN MY PATCHES SUGGESTED SCRAPS AND OJO TRIED IT BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT
THE PLANTS FORMED ROWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND FROM EACH PLANT ROSE A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE BIG BROAD LEAVES WHICH SWAYED CONTINUALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE ALTHOUGH NO WIND WAS BLOWING
MAY BE ANSWERED THE WOOZY
HERE IS THE MINE IN WHICH LIES THE DARK WELL YOU ARE SEEKING
I THINK UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE SELFISH IN ME TO REFUSE YOU THANK YOU
IT'S A HIGHLY CLASSICAL COMPOSITION A WHAT INQUIRED SCRAPS
I'LL TAKE THE CHOPS IF YOU PLEASE VERY WELL
SO THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID A TERRIBLE BATTLE WAS TO EXPLAIN THE JOKE SO THEY COULD UNDERSTAND IT
I DID NOT SEE HIM DO IT AND I WARNED HIM THAT TO DO SO WAS AGAINST THE LAW
DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD THROW ME OVER THAT FENCE
DOROTHY IS OZMA'S BEST FRIEND AND IF YOU CAN WIN HER TO YOUR SIDE YOUR UNCLE IS PRETTY SAFE TO LIVE AGAIN THEN HE TURNED TO THE WOOZY AND SAID
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK OH
THE CAT HAS LOST HER SHOE
THE SAWHORSE HAS BEEN WITH ME EVER SINCE
THE POWDER OF LIFE MUST HAVE FALLEN ON THE PHONOGRAPH HE WENT UP TO IT AND FOUND THAT THE GOLD BOTTLE THAT CONTAINED THE PRECIOUS POWDER HAD DROPPED UPON THE STAND AND SCATTERED ITS LIFE-GIVING GRAINS OVER THE MACHINE
NOW SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU MUST ALL SHUT YOUR EYES TIGHT AND KEEP THEM SHUT UNTIL I TELL YOU TO OPEN THEM I CAN'T OBJECTED SCRAPS
OF THOSE QUALITIES SHE MUST HAVE OBEDIENCE FIRST OF ALL AND SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOTTLE BEARING THAT LABEL AND POURED FROM IT UPON A DISH SEVERAL GRAINS OF THE CONTENTS
ALL OUR COUNTRY IS BLUE YOU KNOW
TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE WORKING MAGIC IN THE LAND OF OZ AND SO OUR LOVELY PRINCESS OZMA PUT A STOP TO IT
GOOD ENOUGH TO SET FIRE TO A FENCE THAT IS TRUE DECLARED SCRAPS
I MADE A MISTAKE IN GIVING HER THE PINK BRAINS YOU SEE THEN OJO WENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND KISSED THE OLD MAN'S MARBLE FACE VERY TENDERLY
OWLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SO VERY WISE GENERALLY THAT A FOOLISH ONE IS UNUSUAL AND YOU PERHAPS KNOW THAT ANYTHING OR ANYONE UNUSUAL IS SURE TO BE INTERESTING TO THE WISE THE OWL FLAPPED ITS WINGS AGAIN MUTTERING THESE WORDS
THAT NIGHT I RAN AWAY WITH JACK TO ESCAPE PUNISHMENT AND I TOOK OLD MOMBI'S POWDER OF LIFE WITH ME
WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE MOUNTAIN PATHS AND SO WE OBEY
ONLY THAT THE NEGLECTED GARDEN HAD FAILED TO GROW FOOD FOR THEM THEY WOULD ALWAYS HAVE LIVED IN THE SOLITARY BLUE FOREST
SHAGS HE WHISPERED DRAWING THE SHAGGY MAN ASIDE PAT ME INTO SHAPE THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW WHILE HIS FRIEND PUNCHED AND PATTED THE SCARECROW'S BODY TO SMOOTH OUT THE HUMPS SCRAPS TURNED TO OJO AND WHISPERED
IT IS A MEDICINE TOO AND NO ONE CAN EVER BE SICK WHO LIVES NEAR RADIUM HAVE YOU PLENTY OF IT ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
CAN'T SAY
CAN'T SAY
CAN'T SAY
WELL AS FOR THAT MY HEAD IS STUFFED WITH PUMPKIN-SEEDS DECLARED JACK
BUT SOMETHING HE READ IN OJO'S EXPRESSION MADE HIM DRAW BACK AND REFUSE TO INTERFERE TO SAVE HIM
THIS WAS THE NATIVE COSTUME OF THOSE WHO INHABITED THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY OF THE LAND OF OZ SO UNC NUNKIE'S DRESS WAS MUCH LIKE THAT OF HIS NEPHEW
IT WILL NEVER BREAK NOR WEAR OUT FINE SAID UNC NUNKIE WAGGING HIS HEAD AND STROKING HIS LONG GRAY BEARD
THE EYES WERE TWO LARGE EMERALDS BUT ASIDE FROM THESE COLORS ALL THE REST OF THE ANIMAL WAS CLEAR GLASS AND IT HAD A SPUN-GLASS TAIL THAT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL
MY DEAR YOU'RE A WONDER
THE MAGICIAN IS VERY BUSY AS I SAID BUT IF YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO DISTURB HIM YOU MAY COME INTO HIS WORKSHOP AND WATCH HIM PREPARE A WONDERFUL CHARM THANK YOU REPLIED THE BOY MUCH PLEASED
OJO AND UNC NUNKIE BOTH STARED AT IT WITH WIDE OPEN EYES FOR SURELY NO SUCH CURIOUS CREATURE HAD EVER EXISTED BEFORE--EVEN IN THE LAND OF OZ
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD OF JACK PUMPKINHEAD
BUT THE PART INHABITED BY THE HORNERS WAS IN NO WAY AS GRAND IN APPEARANCE AS THAT OF THE HOPPERS
WITH THESE TWO THE CHARM WORKED PROMPTLY
JUDGING YOU MERELY BY APPEARANCES I THINK YOU'D BETTER TALK TO THE FOOLISH OWL YONDER THEY TURNED TO LOOK AT THE BIRD WHICH FLUTTERED ITS WINGS AND STARED BACK AT THEM WITH ITS BIG EYES
MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO BE OJO THE LUCKY HOW CAN I ASKED THE BOY WHEN ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO SAVE MY DEAR UNCLE HAVE FAILED NEVER GIVE UP OJO ADVISED DOROTHY
ANYONE ACCUSED OF CRIME IS GIVEN A FAIR TRIAL BY OUR RULER AND HAS EVERY CHANCE TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE
IT'S JUST ONE OF SEVEN DAYS
SWIFTLY IT ENVELOPED HER IN ITS EMBRACE COVERING HER COMPLETELY IN ITS THICK FOLDS AND THEN IT SWAYED BACK UPON ITS STEM
IT'S LUCKY MY STITCHES ARE SO FINE AND STRONG FOR OTHERWISE SUCH HARSH TREATMENT MIGHT RIP ME UP THE BACK ALLOW ME TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE GIANT SAID THE SCARECROW RAISING THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET AND DUSTING HER SKIRT WITH HIS STUFFED HANDS
HERE HERE
WELL WHEN I WAS A BABY GIRL I WAS STOLEN BY AN OLD WITCH NAMED MOMBI AND TRANSFORMED INTO A BOY BEGAN THE GIRL RULER
AHA
BUT NOW HIS EYE WAS ARRESTED BY THE STRANGE SIGHT OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND HE GAZED UPON HER IN MINGLED WONDER AND ADMIRATION
THEN TRYING TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HURRIED FORWARD AND OVERTOOK HIS COMRADES
IT WAS VERY DARK INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL
AND THEN THEY ALL LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AND WONDERED WHAT COULD BE DONE
WHAT WAS THE JOKE ASKED SCRAPS
BUT THE LITTLE GIRL TURNED TO THE QUEER CREATURES AND ASKED
SO THE HISTORIAN RIGGED UP A HIGH TOWER IN HIS BACK YARD AND TOOK LESSONS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY UNTIL HE UNDERSTOOD IT AND THEN BEGAN TO CALL PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ BY SENDING MESSAGES INTO THE AIR
COME ON AND LET'S GET TO THE EMERALD CITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH THIS SHE RAN UP THE PATH SKIPPING AND DANCING AND THEN TURNED TO AWAIT THEM
I MUST GET HUNGRY AND STARVE FOR I CAN'T EAT SHE SAID
ALSO I HAVE SOME LOVELY PINK BRAINS
IF DURING YOUR TRAVELS YOU CAN MANAGE TO LOSE THAT UN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR NAME UNLUCKY YOU WILL THEN BECOME OJO THE LUCKY WHICH WILL BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT HOW CAN I LOSE THAT UN DAME MARGOLOTTE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT YOU MUST KEEP THE MATTER IN MIND AND PERHAPS THE CHANCE WILL COME TO YOU SHE REPLIED
THE FORMER MAGICIAN WITH A CRY OF JOY SPRANG TO HIS FEET LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN WONDER AND THEN FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND WATCHED THE WIZARD WITH FASCINATED INTEREST
MY BUT THAT'S A FINE JOKE
THERE'S NO FUN IN THAT SORT OF EATING ONE SHOULD ONLY EAT TO SUSTAIN LIFE REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN AND THAT TABLET IS EQUAL TO A PECK OF OTHER FOOD I DON'T CARE FOR IT
WHAT'S THE NEWS SINCE I LEFT
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A HAT TO WEAR REMARKED THE WOMAN FOR THAT WOULD KEEP THE SUN FROM FADING THE COLORS OF YOUR FACE
IN AMERICA A GIRL STUFFED WITH COTTON WOULDN'T BE ALIVE NOR WOULD ANYONE THINK OF MAKING A GIRL OUT OF A PATCHWORK QUILT WHAT A QUEER COUNTRY AMERICA MUST BE SHE EXCLAIMED IN GREAT SURPRISE
WHAT QUALITIES HAVE YOU GIVEN YOUR NEW SERVANT ONLY THOSE THAT AN HUMBLE SERVANT REQUIRES SHE ANSWERED
BUT THE PLAY WAS A LITTLE ROUGH AND I'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF IT WHEN YOU INTERFERED SIX OF THEM SAT ON ME SAID OJO BUT AS THEY ARE SO LITTLE THEY DIDN'T HURT ME MUCH JUST THEN THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF THEM OPENED AND A TOTTENHOT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKED AT THE STRANGERS
SEEING THIS THEY ALL CRIED KRIZZLE-KROO TOGETHER AND THAT MADE THE BEAST'S EYES FLASH FIRE SO FIERCELY THAT THE FENCE-BOARD CAUGHT THE SPARKS AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
HOWEVER THE MOMENT THE CRANK STRUCK THE GROUND IT BOUNDED BACK TO THE MACHINE AGAIN AND BEGAN WINDING IT UP
OH THERE YOU ARE SHE EXCLAIMED CHEERFULLY
THAT'S HONEY-BEES SAID THE WOOZY
MY HUSBAND MADE THE CAT SOME PINK BRAINS BUT THEY PROVED TO BE TOO HIGH-BRED AND PARTICULAR FOR A CAT SO SHE THINKS IT IS UNDIGNIFIED IN HER TO CATCH MICE
JUST BEYOND THIS PLACE A JUMBLE OF HUGE JAGGED ROCKS LAY SCATTERED RISING TO THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND THEM
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE HOPPERS THOUGHT IT OVER CAREFULLY
I SHOULD SAY NOT
WHY NOT I SHALL KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY SHE ANSWERED
DO YOU NEED MORE STUFFING
HE KNEW VERY WELL HE WAS GUILTY BUT IT SURPRISED HIM THAT OZMA ALSO KNEW IT
WELL I SHALL CALL YOU VIC FOR SHORT SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT I'M NOT FOOL ENOUGH TO TRY
AT FIRST HE HAD FELT SORROW AND REMORSE BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE UNJUST TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED--UNJUST MERELY BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT SO--THE MORE HE RESENTED HIS ARREST BLAMING OZMA FOR MAKING FOOLISH LAWS AND THEN PUNISHING FOLKS WHO BROKE THEM
SHOO MISS BUNGLE SHOO--SHOO--SHOO
BOTH DOROTHY AND OZMA WERE PLEASED WITH THIS EXPLOIT AND THOUGHT IT SERVED CHISS RIGHT
BUT WHAT CAN HE HAVE DONE AND WHAT MADE HIM DO IT CAN'T SAY REPLIED THE SOLDIER
THE OLD MUNCHKIN IMMEDIATELY CAME TO LIFE AND WITH A LOW BOW TO THE WIZARD SAID
EVERY REASON YOU HAVE GIVEN IS ABSURD
OBEDIENCE CLEVERNESS JUDGMENT COURAGE INGENUITY AMIABILITY LEARNING TRUTH POESY SELF RELIANCE LET ME SEE SAID MARGOLOTTE
HERE COMES MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW WHAT A LIVE SCARECROW ASKED OJO
THAT'S A FINE JOKE--FOR A HORNER--AND WE ARE MUCH PLEASED WITH IT SAID THE CHAMPION SPEAKING BETWEEN THE PICKETS
THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY HELPED ROLL THE LOGS TOGETHER AND CARRY THE STRIPS OF WOOD BUT IT TOOK SO LONG TO MAKE THE RAFT THAT EVENING CAME JUST AS IT WAS FINISHED AND WITH EVENING THE QUADLING'S WIFE RETURNED FROM HER FISHING
SHE FOUND HERSELF BUMPING AND ROLLING IN THE ROAD AND WHEN SHE GOT UP AND TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE FOUND IT LOCKED
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM REPLIED THE GIRL
FINALLY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID
BUT AS A MUSIC-MAKER WE HATE YOU THEN WHY WAS I EVER INVENTED DEMANDED THE MACHINE IN A TONE OF INDIGNANT PROTEST
THIS HE DID IN A SERIES OF HOPS AND HE MOVED SO SWIFTLY IN THIS STRANGE MANNER THAT THOSE WITH TWO LEGS HAD TO RUN TO KEEP UP WITH HIM
BUT THE HAIR WOULDN'T BUDGE
OJO BREAKS THE LAW 15
BUT SOME OF MY FRIENDS EAT REGULARLY
THEIR SKINS WERE DUSKY AND THEIR HAIR STOOD STRAIGHT UP LIKE WIRES AND WAS BRILLIANT SCARLET IN COLOR
ADVICE DOESN'T COST ANYTHING--UNLESS YOU FOLLOW IT
I KNOW HOW HE CAN BE RESTORED TO LIFE AND I'M GOING TO DO IT--OZMA OR NO OZMA
RIGHT INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN SAID OJO PEERING INTO THE DARK HOLE
IF IT WERE WRONG FOR ME TO THROW QUILLS THEN I WOULDN'T BE MADE WITH QUILLS TO THROW
THE MAN WAS STANDING ON THE RIVER BANK AND HE CALLED TO THEM
THEY MEET THE WOOZY 10
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY COULDN'T WE MAKE A RAFT SUGGESTED OJO
WHO BUT POOR MARGOLOTTE COULD HAVE MANAGED TO INVENT SUCH AN UNREASONABLE BEING AS I
ALL WERE NEATLY DRESSED IN SPOTLESS WHITE ROBES AND HAD BROWN SKINS HORNS ON THEIR FOREHEADS AND THREE-COLORED HAIR
SWIFTLY THE RAFT CLIMBED THE BANK OF WATER AND SLID DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE PLUNGING ITS EDGE DEEP INTO THE WATER AND DRENCHING THEM ALL WITH SPRAY
NOW WE CAN GO BACK THEY RETURNED TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL AND BEGAN TO CREEP CAUTIOUSLY UP THE INCLINE
HOW LUCKY CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN
BUT AFTER MAKING SIX BOOKS ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF THOSE INTERESTING BUT QUEER PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ THE HISTORIAN LEARNED WITH SORROW THAT BY AN EDICT OF THE SUPREME RULER OZMA OF OZ HER COUNTRY WOULD THEREAFTER BE RENDERED INVISIBLE TO ALL WHO LIVED OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS AND THAT ALL COMMUNICATION WITH OZ WOULD IN THE FUTURE BE CUT OFF
THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE GREEN COUNTRY AROUND THE EMERALD CITY AND SIX-LEAVED CLOVERS ARE VERY SCARCE EVEN THERE I'LL FIND IT FOR YOU PROMISED OJO
AND THAT WAS THE WAY DOROTHY HEARD THAT THE HISTORIAN WANTED TO SPEAK WITH HER AND THERE WAS A SHAGGY MAN IN THE LAND OF OZ WHO KNEW HOW TO TELEGRAPH A WIRELESS REPLY
BUT IT'S TRUE SAID THE BOY
HULLO OJO SAID SCRAPS
YOU HAVE BUT ONE LEG EACH AND WE HAVE TWO LEGS EACH
BUT WE MUST ADMIT THAT NO LIVING SCARECROW IS HANDSOMER
THE MINE'S MINE THEN HE CHUCKLED GLEEFULLY AS THEY FOLLOWED HIM SILENTLY DOWN THE STEEP SLANT
ONE IS A GIRL AND THE OTHER IS A GILLYFLOWER SAID JACK
I'M SORRY
I'VE BEEN ALIVE A GOOD MANY YEARS FOR DR PIPT EXPERIMENTED ON ME WITH THE FIRST MAGIC POWDER OF LIFE HE EVER MADE AND SO FAR I'VE NEVER BROKEN OR CRACKED OR CHIPPED ANY PART OF ME YOU SEEM TO HAVE A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER LAUGHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THE CAT WENT TO THE MIRROR TO SEE
BUT NOW WE HAVE TALKED ENOUGH SO LET US PLAY A GAME UNTIL BEDTIME CHAPTER SIXTEEN PRINCESS DOROTHY DOROTHY GALE WAS SITTING IN ONE OF HER ROOMS IN THE ROYAL PALACE WHILE CURLED UP AT HER FEET WAS A LITTLE BLACK DOG WITH A SHAGGY COAT AND VERY BRIGHT EYES
BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO TO SAVE HER ANOTHER LEAF BENT DOWN AND CAPTURED THE GLASS CAT ROLLING AROUND THE LITTLE CREATURE UNTIL SHE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN AND THEN STRAIGHTENING UP AGAIN UPON ITS STEM
THEN SHE HAD THE GLASS CAT TAKEN TO ANOTHER ROOM FOR THE NIGHT AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SHE KEPT IN ONE OF HER OWN ROOMS FOR SHE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE STRANGE CREATURE AND WANTED TO TALK WITH HER AGAIN AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND HER BETTER
THEN SHE ARRANGED HIS SUPPER WHICH PROVED THE MOST VARIED AND DELICIOUS MEAL OJO HAD EVER EATEN IN HIS LIFE
THE SCARECROW NODDED HIS HEAD IN APPROVAL OF HIS FRIEND'S SPEECH SO IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE AGREED WITH THE EMPEROR'S DECISION
AS THE OTHER END OF THE CLOTHESLINE WAS BOUND AROUND THE LOGS HE COULD NOT GET IT AWAY AND AS HE HAD GREEDILY SWALLOWED THE GOLD HOOK AT THE FIRST BITE HE COULD NOT GET RID OF THAT EITHER
JUST A LITTLE WAY FARTHER REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN OZMA AND HER FRIENDS THE SHAGGY MAN HAD A ROOM OF HIS OWN IN THE ROYAL PALACE SO THERE HE WENT TO CHANGE HIS SHAGGY SUIT OF CLOTHES FOR ANOTHER JUST AS SHAGGY BUT NOT SO DUSTY FROM TRAVEL
THEN YOU'D BETTER BEGIN YOUR JOURNEY AT ONCE ADVISED THE WIZARD
BUT HE HADN'T
IT'S YOUR DREADFUL MUSIC
I ALWAYS KEEP MY WORD FOR I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING SQUARE
BUT IT IS NATURE'S MAGIC WHICH IS MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANY ART KNOWN TO MAN
NOW THAT WE HAVE STOPPED WE ARE MOVING BACKWARD
TOTO COULD JUMP FROM ONE ROCK TO ANOTHER QUITE EASILY BUT THE OTHERS HAD TO CREEP AND CLIMB WITH CARE SO THAT AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF SUCH WORK DOROTHY AND OJO FOUND THEMSELVES VERY TIRED
BUT I CAN'T MAKE YOU GROW
WHERE'S THE JAM THEN INQUIRED OJO STANDING ON A STOOL SO HE COULD LOOK THROUGH ALL THE SHELVES OF THE CUPBOARD
BUT I CAN'T SEE THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH MUCH
BUT YOU MAY BE SURE SHE WILL BE JUST AND MERCIFUL
I HAVE PINK BRAINS AND YOU CAN SEE EM WORK DOROTHY'S KITTEN IS ALL PINK--BRAINS AND ALL--EXCEPT BLUE EYES
I HOPE HE WON'T GIVE UP SAID OJO ANXIOUSLY
HE SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FRONT OF HIS CAVERN SEIZED THE IRON BARS IN HIS GREAT HAIRY HANDS AND SHOOK THEM UNTIL THEY RATTLED IN THEIR SOCKETS
THE NARROW CANYON TURNED AND TWISTED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THE RIFT WAS SO SMALL THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TOUCH BOTH WALLS AT THE SAME TIME BY STRETCHING OUT THEIR ARMS
BUT THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S LAUGH MADE THE SCARECROW FORGET ALL ABOUT THE WOOZY
MAY I PULL OUT THE HAIRS NOW ANY TIME YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE WOOZY
CHISS
I DON'T CARE FOR EMERALDS
THIS WILL LEAD TO MUTUAL RESPECT AND FRIENDSHIP THE WOOZY WAS SOMEWHAT ABASHED BY THIS SPEECH AND DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REPLY
IT'S BY ODDS THE BEST JOKE I EVER MADE
THEREFORE WE SHOULD TREAT HIM KINDLY BECAUSE OF HIS MISFORTUNE FOR OTHERWISE HE WOULD BECOME HARD AND BITTER AND WOULD NOT BE SORRY HE HAD DONE WRONG
HEE HEE HO THE OTHER HORNERS WHO WERE STANDING BY ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AND SEEMED TO LIKE THEIR CHIEF'S JOKE AS MUCH AS HE DID
BUT PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAIN I WON'T PROMISED DIKSEY
BUT WE EXPECT TO CONQUER THEM THIS AFTERNOON IF WE GET TIME AND THEN YOU MAY GO AND COME AS YOU PLEASE THEY THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THE HOPPER'S ADVICE AND ASKED HIM TO LEAD THE WAY
WHY NOT BECAUSE IT IS MY NATURE TO THROW QUILLS AND EVERY ANIMAL MUST DO WHAT NATURE INTENDS IT TO DO
IT WON'T COME SAID THE BOY PANTING
BUT PERHAPS I WAS MISTAKEN YES SAID THE SHAGGY MAN YOU WERE CERTAINLY WRONG ABOUT THAT THEN HE TURNED TO DOROTHY AND ADDED
AH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SHE SAID
WE ARE TRAVELING ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE DECLARED AND YOU'LL EXCUSE ME IF I SAY WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED HOW VERY IMPOLITE EXCLAIMED THE PHONOGRAPH
HOW LONG MUST WE KEEP THIS UP SHAGS ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS CONSTANTLY TRIPPING AND TUMBLING DOWN ONLY TO GET UP AGAIN WITH A LAUGH AT HER MISHAP
SHE IS CERTAINLY BEWILDERING IF NOT STRICTLY BEAUTIFUL HAVE YOU SEEN HER THEN THE STRAW MAN EAGERLY ASKED
BY CURBING SUCH INCLINATIONS IN MY DAUGHTERS WE KEEP ON THE SAFE SIDE
BUT IF I TRIED IT I'D SURELY RUIN MY LOVELY PATCHES MY STRAW WOULD GET SOGGY IN THE WATER AND I WOULD SINK SAID THE SCARECROW
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY IT'S DIFF'RENT BUT WHEN YOU GET AROUND THE EDGES YOU'RE SURE TO RUN INTO STRANGE LITTLE CORNERS THAT SURPRISE YOU
NEVER MIND SAID OJO
THIS TIME THEY MADE SCRAPS STAY BEHIND FOR FEAR SHE WOULD SLIP AGAIN
AS AGAIN THE RAFT RIGHTED AND DRIFTED ON DOROTHY AND OJO LAUGHED AT THE DUCKING THEY HAD RECEIVED
CHAPTER THIRTEEN SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW FROM HERE ON THE COUNTRY IMPROVED AND THE DESERT PLACES BEGAN TO GIVE WAY TO FERTILE SPOTS
THEY BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE THE SCENES THEY HAD PASSED AND BY AND BY THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE HOUSE OF THE QUADLINGS AGAIN
THEY'RE UGLY AND IN BAD TASTE
THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER YOU'LL GET DECLARED THE SCARECROW WITH HIS COMICAL SMILE FOR NO ONE KNOWS ANY MORE THAN TOTO ABOUT THIS ROAD SAID SCRAPS
AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ANNOUNCED SCRAPS FOR I'M GOING WITH THE SCARECROW AND DOROTHY
THE PATH IS LOCKED THE WAY IS BLOCKED YET HERE WE'VE INNOCENTLY FLOCKED
WHY I'M THOROUGHLY DELIGHTFUL
BUT I DON'T IMAGINE I SHALL LET IT BOTHER ME ABOUT HELPING UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE THAT'S A PRETTY HARD HEART OF YOURS SAID DOROTHY
A DROP OF OIL EXCLAIMED THE TIN WOODMAN
AND THAT WAS A LONG SPEECH FOR UNC NUNKIE BECAUSE IT WAS TWO WORDS
I'LL TRY IT AFTER I'VE BROUGHT THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO LIFE HE SAID
AND THESE FLOWERS BELONG TO THE TIN WOODMAN
PRODUCED BY ANTHONY MATONAC AND PAUL SELKIRK THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ BY L
YOU HAVE NOW HAD A SIX COURSE DINNER DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN
HE DID NOT BREAK THE LAW--NO ONE CAN PROVE HE DID--AND THAT GREEN-WHISKERED SOLDIER HAD NO RIGHT TO ARREST HIM OZMA ORDERED THE BOY'S ARREST SAID DOROTHY AND OF COURSE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING
COME HE SAID
WHAT A LOVELY LEFT EAR
ALL THIS WILL MEAN A LONG JOURNEY FOR YOU
WITH LIGHT HEARTS THEY HURRIED TOWARD IT BEING FULLY RESTED BY THEIR LONG RIDE ON THE RIVER
AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY ALL WENT INTO THE MAGICIAN'S BIG WORKSHOP WHERE THE GLASS CAT WAS LYING BEFORE THE MIRROR AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAY LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE BENCH
HEE HEE
HEE HEE
THE FOOLISH OWL AND THE WISE DONKEY 9
BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL OUT OF BUSINESS AND ONLY THE GREAT SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD IS PERMITTED TO PRACTICE HER ARTS WHICH NEVER HARM ANYBODY
IT IS INTENDED TO BE MY WIFE'S SERVANT MAID HE SAID
MISTER YOOP--HIS CAVE THE LARGEST UNTAMED GIANT IN CAPTIVITY
BEING UNABLE TO SWALLOW SHE THREW AWAY THE BREAD AND LAUGHED
THIRTEEN
BOTH WERE THINKING
IT WAS LOCKED ON BOTH SIDES AND OVER THE LATCH WAS A SIGN READING
THEY PRESENTLY CAME TO A BEAUTIFUL GROVE OF TALL AND STATELY TREES THROUGH WHICH THE ROAD WOUND IN SHARP CURVES--FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN ANOTHER
WHEN HE SAT DOWN UPON A CROOKED CHAIR THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO FIT HIM ONE KNEE WAS UNDER HIS CHIN AND THE OTHER NEAR THE SMALL OF HIS BACK
DON'T BOTHER MY HEAD BY ASKING CONUNDRUMS I BEG OF YOU
ALSO HE WAS VERY COURTEOUS IN MANNER AND SO KIND AND GENTLE THAT EVERYONE LOVED HIM
THIS WOODEN FRAMEWORK WAS COVERED BY A RED SHIRT--WITH WHITE SPOTS IN IT--BLUE TROUSERS A YELLOW VEST A JACKET OF GREEN-AND-GOLD AND STOUT LEATHER SHOES
I DON'T JUST KNOW HOW MUCH A GILL IS BUT I'VE BROUGHT ALONG A GOLD FLASK THAT HOLDS A PINT
THIS THEY DID SPENDING A PLEASANT EVENING WITH THE QUADLING FAMILY AND BEING ENTERTAINED WITH SUCH HOSPITALITY AS THE POOR PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO OFFER THEM
JUST THEN THE DROP OF OIL FELL AND THE BOY CAUGHT IT IN HIS BOTTLE AND IMMEDIATELY CORKED IT TIGHT
HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN ASLEEP BEFORE TOTO'S BARKS AROUSED HIM FOR HE WAS NOW RUBBING HIS EYES AND STARING AT THE LITTLE DOG WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE CRIED DOROTHY STOPPING TO ADMIRE THE PERFECTION OF THESE EXQUISITE FLOWERS
IT WAS THIS CONSIDERATE KINDNESS THAT HELD THEM CLOSE FRIENDS AND ENABLED THEM TO ENJOY ONE ANOTHER'S SOCIETY
BY THIS TIME DOROTHY HAD DISCOVERED THEY WERE PEOPLE TINY AND CURIOUSLY FORMED BUT STILL PEOPLE
THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE PATH THEY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING NOW MADE A BEND AND PASSED AROUND THE ENCLOSURE BUT WHAT MADE OJO STOP AND LOOK THOUGHTFUL WAS A SIGN PAINTED ON THE FENCE WHICH READ
SCARECROW THIS IS MISS SCRAPS PATCHES
JINJUR DID A NEAT JOB DIDN'T SHE
WHEN I GOT TO THE EMERALD CITY THE GOOD SORCERESS GLINDA KNEW WHO I WAS AND RESTORED ME TO MY PROPER PERSON WHEN I BECAME THE RIGHTFUL RULER OF THIS LAND
FOR IF YOU DISPLEASE OUR POWERFUL RULER YOUR JOURNEY WILL SURELY PROVE A FAILURE
SOLID GLASS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND REJOINED THE SHAGGY MAN SLEEPILY
YOU FOR INSTANCE SAID HE
I THINK YOU'D BETTER LET ME EXPLAIN THAT INTERRUPTED THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE TOLD DOROTHY ALL OF OJO'S STORY AND HOW UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE HAD ACCIDENTALLY BEEN TURNED TO MARBLE BY THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION
THE MAGICIAN GAVE A JUMP
IS THERE A DARK WELL IN ANY PART OF YOUR COUNTRY A DARK WELL
WORST WE SHALL HAVE TO TRAVEL
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE HER PRETTY TO LOOK AT ASKED THE CAT
THE CHIEF DIDN'T KNOW HOW BUT DIKSEY SAID
THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NOW LED THEM ALL THROUGH THE GATE AND INTO A LITTLE ROOM BUILT IN THE WALL
I KNOW A MAN WHO LIVES ON THE OPPOSITE BANK FOR I'VE SEEN HIM THERE A GOOD MANY YEARS
THEN IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE BLUE FOREST IT IS GOOD DAME MARGOLOTTE DEAR ME SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE MAN YOU MUST BE UNC NUNKIE KNOWN AS THE SILENT ONE THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE BOY
YOU WERE CRAZY TO ACT SO BADLY AND GET THROWN OUTDOORS REMARKED BUNGLE AS THEY RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY
HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW BEAUTIFUL MY PATCHES ARE IN THIS SUNLIGHT JUST THEN THEY HEARD A SOUND AS OF FOOTSTEPS PATTERING ALONG THE PATH BEHIND THEM AND ALL THREE TURNED TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING
THEN HE SCREWED THE TOP OF THE FLASK FIRMLY IN PLACE AND PUT THE PRECIOUS WATER IN HIS POCKET
SO THE SCARECROW MOUNTED TO THE JEWELED SADDLE AND WAVED HIS HAT WHEN THE SAWHORSE DARTED AWAY SO SWIFTLY THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN AN INSTANT
ALSO I FEEL IT IS WRONG TO LEAVE THOSE TWO VICTIMS STANDING AS MARBLE STATUES WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE ALIVE
CONSIDER HOW MANY YEARS IT IS SINCE I'VE EATEN A SINGLE PLUMP LITTLE GIRL
HE SAW AT A GLANCE HOW LOVELY AND SWEET SHE WAS AND HIS HEART GAVE A BOUND OF JOY FOR HE HOPED SHE WOULD BE MERCIFUL
NO REPLIED OJO MUCH SURPRISED
THE JOKING HORNERS 23
ON THE CONTRARY THE ROOM WAS OF DAZZLING BRILLIANCE AND BEAUTY FOR IT WAS LINED THROUGHOUT WITH AN EXQUISITE METAL THAT RESEMBLED TRANSLUCENT FROSTED SILVER
AND I'LL CATCH YOU IF I CAN WITH THIS THE GIANT PUSHED HIS BIG ARMS WHICH LOOKED LIKE TREE-TRUNKS EXCEPT THAT TREE-TRUNKS DON'T WEAR PINK VELVET BETWEEN THE IRON BARS AND THE ARMS WERE SO LONG THAT THEY TOUCHED THE OPPOSITE WALL OF THE ROCK PASSAGE
I'M FOND OF YOU ALL AND I HATE TO SHOCK YOU IT SAID
CAN YOU HELP US
BUT THE LAST LEAF OF THE ROW OF PLANTS SEIZED THE BEAST EVEN AS HE RAN AND INSTANTLY HE DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT
ARE YOU EQUAL TO A SWIFT RUN ANYTHING THAT SUITS YOU SUITS ME RETURNED THE WOODEN HORSE
WHAT'S RAG-TIME THE OPPOSITE OF CLASSICAL ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS AND TURNED OVER THE RECORD
IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH THE CHEESE
IT HAS ALWAYS SOUNDED VERY FEARFUL TO ME BUT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLOSE TO MY EARS NEVER MIND OJO SAID SOOTHINGLY
MISS FOOLISH OWL AND MR WISE DONKEY
THEN SHE CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO DOROTHY
SHE'S STARK STARING RAVING CRAZY AND HER BRAINS CAN'T BE PINK FOR THEY DON'T WORK PROPERLY BOTHER THE BRAINS CRIED SCRAPS
IF YOU DON'T THEY'LL PROBABLY HOP OVER HERE AND CONQUER YOU WE'RE NOT AFRAID--AS LONG AS THE GATE IS LOCKED DECLARED THE CHIEF
PERHAPS THE HORNERS CAN FIND A WAY SUGGESTED OJO
IN ONE OF THE ROCK WALLS--THAT AT THEIR LEFT--WAS HOLLOWED A GREAT CAVERN IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A ROW OF THICK IRON BARS THE TOPS AND BOTTOMS BEING FIRMLY FIXED IN THE SOLID ROCK
LET ME IN MARGOLOTTE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR
NOT NOW ANSWERED THE CHAMPION
DON'T YOU WISH OJO WITH ALL YOUR HEART THAT YOU HAD NOT BEEN DISOBEDIENT AND BROKEN A LAW OF OZ I--I HATE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE HE ADMITTED
OJO GOT UP AND PUT ON HIS SHOES
IN ONE PLACE A CASE FILLED WITH BOOKS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND ELSEWHERE OJO SAW A CUPBOARD CONTAINING ALL SORTS OF GAMES
OJO UTTERED SUCH A CRY OF ASTONISHMENT THAT IT AROUSED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO ALSO HALTED
HE HAD BUSHY BLUE WHISKERS AND MERRY BLUE EYES AND HIS BLUE CLOTHES WERE QUITE OLD AND WORN
AS THE ROYAL AUDIENCE WAS NOW OVER THEY BEGAN TO LEAVE THE THRONE ROOM AND SOON THERE WERE NONE REMAINING EXCEPT OJO AND HIS FRIENDS AND OZMA AND HER FAVORITES
YOU ARE CERTAINLY A WONDER MY DEAR AND I FANCY YOU'D MAKE A SPLENDID PINCUSHION
OZCOT AT HOLLYWOOD IN CALIFORNIA LIST OF CHAPTERS 1
DON'T YOU OWN A BOAT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
GLAD TO MEET YOU TOTTENHOTS SAID THE SCARECROW SOLEMNLY
DID YOU NOTICE MY BRAINS STRANGER
EV'RY TIME I SEE A RIVER I HAVE CHILLS THAT MAKE ME SHIVER FOR I NEVER CAN FORGET ALL THE WATER'S VERY WET
SCRAPS THIS IS THE SCARECROW
A PRISONER CRIED THE LITTLE MAN JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR
HE SAID HIS WIFE WANTED IT FOR SOME ESPECIAL PURPOSE SO I DO SHE ANSWERED
MAYBE WE SHALL FIND ANOTHER THAT IS TAME AND GENTLE PERHAPS THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER AT ALL ANSWERED OJO
THE TIN WOODMAN OBJECTS 28
NO REPLIED THE DONKEY
SHAGGY MAN TO THE RESCUE 11
BUT I LEARNED THAT SOME OF THE WITCHES AND MAGICIANS WERE STILL PRACTICING MAGIC ON THE SLY AND USING THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVERS TO MAKE THEIR POTIONS AND CHARMS
I'VE SURRENDERED AND IT ISN'T POLITE TO CAPTURE THOSE YOU'VE SURRENDERED TO NEVER MIND THAT SAID DOROTHY
AMONG THESE OJO RECOGNIZED STATUES OF DOROTHY TOTO THE SCARECROW THE WIZARD THE SHAGGY MAN JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND OZMA ALL STANDING UPON NEAT PEDESTALS OF TIN
WHY WHAT'S WRONG ASKED DOROTHY IN ASTONISHMENT
WHEN ONE COMES TO THE EDGE OF OZ IN ANY DIRECTION THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SEEN AT ALL
INDEED IT IS SHE REPLIED
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE THERE IS A DARK WELL NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING SAID THE TOTTENHOT
MAYBE HE'LL BE WILLING TO EXPLAIN HIS JOKE TO THE HOPPERS ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
THIS MAN WAS A WOODCHOPPER AND LIVED ALL ALONE IN THE LITTLE HOUSE
OZMA CAME FORWARD TO CONGRATULATE THEM
BUT THE GATES STOOD WIDE OPEN BECAUSE THE EMPEROR HAD NO ENEMIES TO DISTURB HIM
BEWARE THE CAPTIVE YOOP WHY AS FOR THAT REMARKED DOROTHY IF YOOP IS A CAPTIVE THERE'S NO NEED TO BEWARE OF HIM
MORE THAN WE CAN USE
SO FAR THEY HAD MET NO LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN OJO SAW THE CAVE HE KNEW IT MUST BE THE DEN OF THE WOOZY
RIDDLE-CUM TIDDLE-CUM TOO-RA-LA-LOO THAT BEATS YOUR POETRY SCRAPS SAID OJO
SHE MAKES ME LAUGH AND LAUGHTER IS THE BEST THING IN LIFE
THEY FOUND ON COMING NEARER THAT THIS GATE WAS LOCKED WITH A GREAT PADLOCK RUSTY THROUGH LACK OF USE
THE BOY WAS MOODY AND BAD TEMPERED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AFTERWARD BECAUSE HE COULD REALLY SEE NO HARM IN PICKING A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER IF HE FOUND ONE AND IN SPITE OF WHAT THE SHAGGY MAN HAD SAID HE CONSIDERED OZMA'S LAW TO BE UNJUST
BUT THAT ISN'T TO BE WONDERED AT WHEN YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY DIFFERENT THINGS SHE'S MADE OF
THE CROOKED MAGICIAN MADE A POWDER OF LIFE SPRINKLED ME WITH IT AND--HERE I AM
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE
LET US START AT ONCE
WHEN IT GREW QUITE DARK OUTSIDE OJO SAID
AS SOON AS HE GRABS ME THE REST OF YOU CAN SLIP PAST HIM OUT OF HIS REACH AND HE WILL SOON LET ME GO BECAUSE I AM NOT FIT TO EAT THEY DECIDED TO TRY THIS PLAN AND DOROTHY TOOK TOTO IN HER ARMS SO AS TO PROTECT HIM
IN THIS ATTIRE THE BOY PRESENTED A VERY QUAINT APPEARANCE
OZMA'LL BE MAD AS HOPS WHEN SHE HEARS HE'S BEEN DOING MAGIC AGAIN
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HOUSE SAID UNC NUNKIE
SEATED ON IVORY CHAIRS BEFORE OZMA WITH A CLEAR SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND THE THRONE WERE MANY OF THE NOBILITY OF THE EMERALD CITY LORDS AND LADIES IN BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES AND OFFICIALS OF THE KINGDOM IN THE ROYAL UNIFORMS OF OZ
STILL SAID THE SHAGGY MAN THE GLASS CAT IS VERY PRETTY AND IF SHE WERE NOT SO CONCEITED OVER HER PINK BRAINS NO ONE WOULD OBJECT TO HER AS A COMPANION THE WIZARD HAD BEEN EATING SILENTLY UNTIL NOW WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND REMARKED
THE RED WAS AT THE BOTTOM AND SOMETIMES HUNG OVER THEIR EYES
TOTO KEPT AN EYE OPEN HOWEVER AND UTTERED LOW THREATENING GROWLS WHENEVER THE RACKET MADE BY THE CREATURES OUTSIDE BECAME TOO BOISTEROUS
SOON HOWEVER THEY REALIZED THE TRUTH
THIS SEEMED AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION AND AT ONCE DR PIPT SET TO WORK TO MAKE A NEW BATCH OF HIS MAGIC POWDER
HAVEN'T TIME TO BE A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR SO I'LL JUST SING YOU THIS LITTLE SONG FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERTAINED AND LISTENED WITH INTEREST WHILE THE SHAGGY MAN CHANTED THE FOLLOWING VERSES TO A TUNE THAT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT
HE IS WORKING IN THE MINES JUST NOW BUT HE'LL BE HOME BEFORE LONG
IT'S WHAT I EAT WELL I MUST SAY I'M MUCH OBLIGED AND I'M GLAD YOU CAME ANNOUNCED THE BEAST
NONE THAT EVER I HEARD OF WAS THE ANSWER
IT NEVER BUNCHES BUT IT'S INCLINED TO PACK DOWN AND MAKE ME SAG BUT COTTON IS A HIGH-GRADE STUFFING
PROVE HE PICKED IT IF YOU CAN OZMA TURNED TO OJO
THEN TELL ME WHERE YOU FOUND HER AND--DEAR ME WHAT A QUEER CAT
WHY THAT'S MY DOG TOTO AN HE'S THE KINDEST DOG IN ALL THE WORLD
THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN JACK AND EXAMINED HIM ADMIRINGLY
ANY MORE TRY SOME CHEESE SAID OJO AND THREW DOWN A PIECE
SHE WORE A PLAIN WHITE FROCK WITHOUT ANY JEWELS OR OTHER ORNAMENTS EXCEPT AN EMERALD-GREEN HAIR-RIBBON FOR DOROTHY WAS A SIMPLE LITTLE GIRL AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LEAST SPOILED BY THE MAGNIFICENCE SURROUNDING HER
BUT WHAT ELSE DOES THIS CROOKED MAGICIAN WANT ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
HE COUNTED THEM CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE
NOW SHE TURNED TO OZMA AND ASKED
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW THESE REMARKS WERE GREETED WITH SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER BY THE IMPISH CREATURES AND ONE SEIZED THE SCARECROW'S ARM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THE STRAW MAN WHIRL AROUND SO EASILY
BUT MEANTIME I MUST WATCH IT CAREFULLY LEST A GUST OF WIND BLOW IT AWAY OR SCATTER IT UNC NUNKIE MARGOLOTTE AND THE MAGICIAN ALL STOOD LOOKING AT THE MARVELOUS POWDER BUT OJO WAS MORE INTERESTED JUST THEN IN THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S BRAINS
WHEN SHE SAT ON HER SPLENDID EMERALD THRONE IN THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF HER PALACE AND MADE LAWS AND SETTLED DISPUTES AND TRIED TO KEEP ALL HER SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED SHE WAS AS DIGNIFIED AND DEMURE AS ANY QUEEN MIGHT BE
THEN THEY WON'T DARE SAY YOU HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS THEY DO THE HOPPERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER QUESTIONINGLY AND BLINKED THEIR EYES AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT IT ALL MEANT
NONE OF THE HORNERS WAS YET AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF STRANGERS WHO WATCHED THE LITTLE BROWN PEOPLE FOR A TIME AND THEN WENT TO THE BIG GATE IN THE CENTER OF THE DIVIDING FENCE
ARE YOU HURT CALLED THE PATCHWORK GIRL ANXIOUSLY
CHAPTER FOURTEEN OJO BREAKS THE LAW WHAT A QUEER MAN REMARKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY WHEN THE PARTY HAD RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OJO HAS DONE BUT IT COULDN'T BE ANYTHING VERY BAD FOR YOU AND I WERE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME THE SHAGGY MAN MADE NO REPLY TO THIS SPEECH AND PRESENTLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL FORGOT ALL ABOUT OJO IN HER ADMIRATION OF THE WONDERFUL CITY SHE HAD ENTERED
IT WOULDN'T DO TO HAVE EVERYONE LIVE IN THE EMERALD CITY YOU KNOW FOR SOME MUST PLOW THE LAND AND RAISE GRAINS AND FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHILE OTHERS CHOP WOOD IN THE FORESTS OR FISH IN THE RIVERS OR HERD THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE POOR THINGS SAID SCRAPS
BUT JUST NOW OZMA'S ORDERS MUST BE OBEYED WITH THIS HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS MADE OF GOLD AND SET WITH RUBIES AND DIAMONDS AND THESE HE SNAPPED OVER OJO'S WRISTS
I AM ON DUTY AND I HAVE ORDERS TO EXECUTE
FAST OR SLOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU DON'T KNOW
BUT YOU MUSTN'T EXPECT US TO PLAY WITH YOU ALL NIGHT FOR WE'VE TRAVELED ALL DAY AND SOME OF US ARE TIRED AND WE NEVER GAMBLE ADDED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT PERHAPS YOU CAME FROM SOME FARAWAY CORNER OF OUR LAND AND HAVING NO LOVE FOR OZMA CARELESSLY BROKE ONE OF HER LAWS YES SAID OJO I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN THE HEART OF A LONELY FOREST WHERE I SAW NO ONE BUT DEAR UNC NUNKIE I THOUGHT SO SAID TOLLYDIGGLE
THE MAGICIAN NODDED
BY TO-MORROW MORNING THE BOY WENT ON WE MUST GO WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO EAT OR WE SHALL GROW VERY HUNGRY AND BECOME VERY UNHAPPY WHERE ASKED UNC
THAT'S MY STRAW YOU KNOW
THIS FILLED THE POOR FELLOW WITH FEAR AND IN HOPPING OUT OF TOTO'S REACH HE SUDDENLY LOST HIS BALANCE AND TUMBLED HEEL OVER HEAD UPON THE FLOOR
IS THAT MAGIC THE GLASS ANIMAL INQUIRED
ONE WAY LED TO THE LEFT AND THE OTHER TO THE RIGHT--STRAIGHT UP THE MOUNTAIN
I THOUGHT THAT THE BEST PLACE TO GO AT FIRST BECAUSE THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER MAY BE FOUND THERE I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID THE SHAGGY MAN AND SHOW YOU THE WAY THANK YOU EXCLAIMED OJO
IT IS THE MOST AWFUL GROWL THAT EVER WAS HEARD ON LAND OR SEA IN CAVERNS OR IN THE SKY PROTESTED THE WOOZY
WHAT RIGHT HAS THIS GIRL RULER TO KEEP MY UNC NUNKIE A STATUE FOREVER DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT JUST NOW ADVISED THE SCARECROW
I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD MUSIC WHEN I FIRST CAME TO LIFE AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT AGAIN
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT 6
SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE FORGETTING YOUR MANNERS EXCUSE ME RETURNED THE MAGICIAN
FOR BEDS THEY MUST USE THE SWEET DRIED GRASSES WHICH JACK HAD STREWN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT THAT SATISFIED DOROTHY AND OJO VERY WELL
YOU MUST BE AWFULLY HUNGRY SAID THE BOY
WHEN THE ATTACK WAS OVER THEY ALL RAN TO THE SHAGGY MAN WHO WAS MOANING AND GROANING AND SCRAPS PROMPTLY PULLED THE QUILL OUT OF HIS LEG
ALL READY ALL READY THEY ANSWERED
IT WAS ONLY A BIT OF DRIED ROOT TAKEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN SHRUB BUT THE BOY RUBBED IT UPON THE WOUND MADE BY THE QUILL AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THE PLACE WAS HEALED ENTIRELY AND THE SHAGGY MAN'S LEG WAS AS GOOD AS EVER
ALL YOU LACK IS DIGNITY I HATE DIGNITY CRIED SCRAPS KICKING A PEBBLE HIGH IN THE AIR AND THEN TRYING TO CATCH IT AS IT FELL
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM WHO ME ASKED SCRAPS LOOKING AROUND THE PRETTY ROOM INSTEAD OF AT THE GIRL
STILL SAID SCRAPS REFLECTIVELY
IF IT WERE ON THE END OF YOUR NOSE IT MIGHT BE UNLUCKY BUT UNDER YOUR ARM IT IS LUCKILY OUT OF THE WAY FOR ALL THOSE REASONS SAID THE MUNCHKIN BOY I HAVE BEEN CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY THEN WE MUST TURN OVER A NEW LEAF AND CALL YOU HENCEFORTH OJO THE LUCKY DECLARED THE TIN MAN
WE'VE NO OBJECTION TO YOU AS A MACHINE YOU KNOW
BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR THE GLASS CAT
THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN AGAIN AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED
IT WAS LIKE A GREAT BANDAGE ALL AROUND HIM AND HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MOVE HIS BODY OR LIMBS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION
MY COTTON STUFFING HAD SAGGED A GOOD DEAL WITH THE DAY'S WALKING AND THEY'VE LOOSENED IT UP UNTIL I FEEL AS PLUMP AS A SAUSAGE
HIGH LIFE DOESN'T SEEM TO AGREE WITH MY CONSTITUTION AND THEN THEY HURRIED AWAY TO ESCAPE THE LAUGHTER OF THE HORNERS WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS ANOTHER JOKE
SOME CALL IT A CRAZY-QUILT AND SOME A PATCHWORK QUILT
IF I TAKE THE THREE HAIRS TO THE MAGICIAN IT WON'T MATTER IF THEY ARE STILL IN YOUR BODY IT CAN'T MATTER IN THE LEAST AGREED THE WOOZY
YOU MADE ME PRETTY--VERY PRETTY INDEED--AND I LOVE TO WATCH MY PINK BRAINS ROLL AROUND WHEN THEY'RE WORKING AND TO SEE MY PRECIOUS RED HEART BEAT SHE WENT TO A LONG MIRROR AS SHE SAID THIS AND STOOD BEFORE IT LOOKING AT HERSELF WITH AN AIR OF MUCH PRIDE
WELL WHY DON'T YOU SPRINKLE SOME OF THAT POWDER ON THEM AND BRING THEM TO LIFE AGAIN ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THE BODY OF THIS REMARKABLE PERSON WAS MADE OF WOOD BRANCHES OF TREES OF VARIOUS SIZES HAVING BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE
MUCH OBLIGED
LET ME SEE
IF DOROTHY GOES THEN I MUST GO TO TAKE CARE OF HER SAID THE SCARECROW DECIDEDLY
AND I'VE FACED THE FIGHTING TREES WHICH BEND DOWN THEIR BRANCHES TO POUND AND WHIP YOU AND HAD MANY OTHER ADVENTURES THERE IT'S A WILD COUNTRY REMARKED DOROTHY SOBERLY AND IF WE GO THERE WE'RE SURE TO HAVE TROUBLES OF OUR OWN
THEN BACK SHE CAME LUGGING IN HER ARMS THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHICH SHE SET UPON THE BENCH AND PROPPED UP SO THAT THE FIGURE WOULD NOT TUMBLE OVER
WE CONSIDER A PRISONER UNFORTUNATE
UPON THE FEET SHE HAD SEWN A PAIR OF RED LEATHER SHOES WITH POINTED TOES
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE ASKED THE WOOZY WHICH OJO HAD DRAGGED HERE AND THERE ALL AROUND THE CLEARING IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO PULL OUT THE HAIR
IT'S A LITTLE TIRESOME TO WALK BACKWARD BUT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PASS THIS PART OF THE ROAD WHICH HAS A TRICK OF SLIDING BACK AND CARRYING WITH IT ANYONE WHO IS WALKING UPON IT WITH NEW COURAGE AND ENERGY THEY NOW TRUDGED FORWARD AND AFTER A TIME CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE ROAD CUT THROUGH A LOW HILL LEAVING HIGH BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT
WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY ROAD IF THE RIVER STOPS EVERYONE WALKING ALONG IT WOW SAID TOTO GAZING EARNESTLY INTO HER FACE
HE WON'T BE TOO LONG BECAUSE HE'S SHORT
I AM ENJOYING LIFE AND SEEING THE WORLD WHILE THE WOMAN WHO MADE ME IS STANDING HELPLESS AS A BLOCK OF WOOD
AS SOON AS ALL OF THEM HAD PASSED THE BIG ROCK IT SLOWLY TURNED AND FILLED UP THE OPENING AGAIN
SLOWLY INCH BY INCH THEY FLOATED ON AND THE FISH TUGGED AND TUGGED AND KEPT THEM GOING
IN THAT CASE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING HE SAID
DO YOU THINK A PINK KITTEN--COMMON MEAT--IS AS PRETTY AS I AM SHE ASKED
MARGOLOTTE NOW CARRIED THE DISH OF BRAINS TO THE BENCH
WE HAVE ALL BEEN INTERESTED IN OJO THE LITTLE WIZARD CONTINUED BECAUSE HIS LOVE FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE UNCLE HAS LED HIM BRAVELY TO FACE ALL SORTS OF DANGERS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT RESCUE HIM
ONE YEAR YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THEM
AND WHEN I PROMISE ANYTHING YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT CAUSE I'M SQUARE I DON'T SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES OBSERVED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AS THEY FOUND THE PATH AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY
BUT I WILL SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING AMONG THESE CHARMS WHICH WILL CURE YOUR LEG SOON HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE CHARMS WAS LABELLED
BY AND BY HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A WHISTLE AS OF SOME ONE WHISTLING A TUNE
BUT THEN UNC NEVER DID SAY ANYTHING UNLESS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
DID YOU PICK THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER SHE ASKED
WHEE EXCLAIMED SCRAPS CLASPING HER PADDED HANDS IN ECSTACY THAT'LL DO FOR ME TO LIVE IN ALL RIGHT
AND NO CAKE--NO JELLY--NO APPLES--NOTHING BUT BREAD ALL SAID UNC AGAIN STROKING HIS BEARD AS HE GAZED FROM THE WINDOW
THIS BEING QUITE TRUE THEY WENT ON
SEEING THE STRANGERS THE WOOZY FOLDED HIS HIND LEGS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN HINGED AND SAT DOWN TO LOOK HIS VISITORS OVER
IF I CAN FIND A WOOZY I'LL GET THE HAIRS FROM ITS TAIL SAID OJO
WHAT A RELIEF IT WILL BE IT WILL INDEED RELIEVE YOU OF MUCH DRUDGERY SAID THE MAGICIAN
ONCE MORE THE TRICK RIVER REVERSED ITS CURRENT BUT THIS TIME THE SCARECROW WAS ON GUARD AND USED THE POLE TO PUSH THE RAFT TOWARD A BIG ROCK WHICH LAY IN THE WATER
TOTO FLEW OUT OF THE LITTLE GIRL'S ARMS AND LANDED SOME DISTANCE AHEAD AND ALL WERE SO DAZED THAT IT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE THEY COULD SCRAMBLE TO THEIR FEET AGAIN
NO ONE INTENDS TO SWIM THAT RIVER NO DECIDED DOROTHY WE COULDN'T SWIM IT IF WE TRIED
THEN HE RAN AWAY TO GET THE LADDER AND WHILE HE WAS GONE THE HORNERS GATHERED AROUND AND WELCOMED THE STRANGERS TO THEIR COUNTRY FOR THROUGH THEM A GREAT WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED
SAT HERE AND WATCHED THE STARS AND THE MOON SHE REPLIED
ISN'T IT GENERAL THAT AT LEAST WAS THE REPLY
BUT IF YOU'RE GAY AND WITH US PLAY WE'LL DO NO HARM TO YOU
THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT IN THAT HOUSE FOR I HAD A FINE BREAKFAST AND I SLEPT IN A NICE BED DON'T YOU FEEL TIRED ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL NOTICING THAT THE BOY YAWNED
DOROTHY WAS READING IN A BOOK THIS EVENING WHEN JELLIA JAMB THE FAVORITE SERVANT-MAID OF THE PALACE CAME TO SAY THAT THE SHAGGY MAN WANTED TO SEE HER
BUT IN EXTENT THE CITY WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT OF THE HOPPERS AND THE STREETS WERE THRONGED WITH NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO BUSIED THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS WAYS
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS PALACE PRESENTLY AND THAT SOMETHING WILL I AM SURE PLEASE YOU ALL
EVEN THE FIELDS WERE NO LONGER CULTIVATED AND THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO RESEMBLE A WILDERNESS
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE RIVER CHANGES ITS DIRECTION EVERY LITTLE WHILE
IF YOU BELONGED TO ME I'D WEAR SMOKED GLASSES WHEN I LOOKED AT YOU WHY ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THEN SHE SEATED HERSELF AT A DESK AND ASKED
SHALL I THROW IN A STONE TO WAKEN HIM NO
SO OJO SNUGGLED DOWN IN HIS BED AND FELL ASLEEP AND HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE NEVER WAKENED UNTIL BROAD DAYLIGHT
I'M QUITE FULL
BUT SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW AS IF THAT FACT DISARMED ALL CRITICISM
THEY HAVE GIVEN MY STRAW A GOOD SHAKING UP AND TAKEN ALL THE LUMPS OUT OF IT
HE WAS SOMETHING OF A DANDY AND KEPT HIS TIN BODY BRILLIANTLY POLISHED AND HIS TIN JOINTS WELL OILED
THEN IT BURST INTO FLAME AND THE WOOZY STEPPED BACK AND SAID TRIUMPHANTLY
IT'S FREE ISN'T IT CERTAINLY SAID THE DONKEY
NO MORE OF THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY FOR THESE PATCHES--AND NO MORE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHY YOU BELONG TO DR PIPT REPLIED OJO LOOKING AT HER IN AMAZEMENT
PATCHES BUNGLE MUNCHKIN LAD FACING FORTUNES GOOD AND BAD MEETING DANGERS GRAVE AND SAD SOMETIMES WORRIED SOMETIMES GLAD WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU DON'T KNOW NOR DO I BUT OFF YOU GO SOUNDS LIKE A HINT TO ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT HE DID NOT KNOW OF ANY
WHENEVER WE FIGHT THE HORNERS OUR PLAN IS TO PUSH THEM BACK FOR OUR ARMS ARE LONGER THAN THEIRS THEN YOU ARE BETTER ARMED SAID SCRAPS
TOO MUCH SPLENDOR BECOMES TIRESOME YOU KNOW
HOW DARE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON CHISS I'M GOING TO DO WORSE THAN THAT OLD BOY REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN
WHO ARE YOU THEY ANSWERED THIS QUESTION ALL TOGETHER IN A SORT OF CHANTING CHORUS THE WORDS BEING AS FOLLOWS
SO WHEN YOU MEND YOUR LEGS YOU MEND YOUR WAYS
I DON'T SEE WHY WE ARE TOLD TO BEWARE THE YOOP UNLESS HE IS DANGEROUS OBSERVED THE SCARECROW IN A PUZZLED TONE
YET WITH ALL HER QUEENLY QUALITIES OZMA WAS A REAL GIRL AND ENJOYED THE THINGS IN LIFE THAT OTHER REAL GIRLS ENJOY
THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS OF COURSE
WE MAY AS WELL PASS THE NIGHT HERE WHERE THERE IS SHELTER FOR OUR HEADS AND GOOD WATER TO DRINK
MUCH HAS BEEN TOLD AND WRITTEN CONCERNING THE BEAUTY OF PERSON AND CHARACTER OF THIS SWEET GIRL RULER OF THE LAND OF OZ--THE RICHEST THE HAPPIEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL FAIRYLAND OF WHICH WE HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE
WHAT CRIME BREAKING A LAW OF OZ ALL RIGHT
WITH HIS SHARP KNIFE THE SHAGGY MAN SLICED OFF THE STEM OF THE LEAF AND AS IT FELL AND UNFOLDED OUT TROTTED THE WOOZY AND ESCAPED BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY MORE OF THE DANGEROUS PLANTS
WITH MY HEART-RENDING GROWL--MY HORRIBLE SHUDDERFUL GROWL
LET'S FIND THE THINGS THEN SUGGESTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
THE STREETS OF THIS CITY WERE NOT PAVED NOR HAD ANY ATTEMPT BEEN MADE TO BEAUTIFY THE HOUSES OR THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND HAVING NOTICED THIS CONDITION SCRAPS WAS ASTONISHED WHEN THE CHIEF USHERED HER INTO HIS HOME
THAT'S RADIUM ANSWERED THE CHIEF
LET'S RUN CRIED SCRAPS AND THEY ALL STARTED AND RAN DOWN THE PATH AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO
BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE RUNNING ROUND A HAYSTACK DOESN'T IT YES SAID THE SCARECROW
HURRY UP CAN'T YOU
THE HORNERS WERE MUCH SURPRISED
THAT SAID HE WILL BE A HARD TASK BUT IF YOU TRAVEL FAR ENOUGH YOU MAY DISCOVER IT I AM WILLING TO TRAVEL FOR YEARS IF IT WILL SAVE UNC NUNKIE DECLARED OJO EARNESTLY
IF THE FISH CAN HOLD OUT UNTIL THE CURRENT CHANGES AGAIN WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT THE FISH DID NOT GIVE UP BUT HELD THE RAFT BRAVELY ON ITS COURSE TILL AT LAST THE WATER IN THE RIVER SHIFTED AGAIN AND FLOATED THEM THE WAY THEY WANTED TO GO
OJO WAS MUCH ASTONISHED FOR NOT ONLY WAS THIS UNLIKE ANY PRISON HE HAD EVER HEARD OF BUT HE WAS BEING TREATED MORE AS A GUEST THAN A CRIMINAL
THE TRAVELERS WERE CORDIALLY WELCOMED TO THIS QUAINT DOMICILE AND INVITED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE WHICH THEY HAD PLANNED TO DO
PERHAPS THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO THROUGH THE GATE
FINDING A TOILET STAND AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED HE WASHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND BRUSHED HIS HAIR
OJO WONDERED IF SCRAPS HAD STOPPED SCREAMING OR IF THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF PREVENTED HIS HEARING HER
I WON'T BE LONG AND THEN SHE WENT OUT BY A DOOR AND LEFT THE PRISONER ALONE
AS HE APPROACHED IT HE STUDIED THE TREE EARNESTLY WONDERING IF ANY FRUIT GREW ON IT OR IF IT BORE PRETTY FLOWERS
IT IS CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IS CONSIDERED THE BEST AND MOST PUZZLING EVER MANUFACTURED
I DON'T CARE A STRAW FOR A SCARECROW
THERE WERE SOME HILLS WITH VALLEYS BETWEEN THEM AND ON REACHING THE TOP OF ONE OF THESE HILLS THE TRAVELERS FOUND BEFORE THEM A HIGH WALL RUNNING TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AS FAR AS THEIR EYES COULD REACH
OJO THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SO TALL A MAN BEFORE
I CAN'T DO THAT SAID THE BEAST
BUT WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN TOLD HER OF THE MUNCHKIN BOY'S ARREST BY THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS BECAUSE HE WAS ACCUSED OF WILFULLY BREAKING A LAW OF OZ THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SHOCKED
HE WAS HUNGRY AND THE BREAKFAST LOOKED GOOD
THE FIRST NIGHT THEY SLEPT ON THE BROAD FIELDS AMONG THE BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES AND THE SCARECROW COVERED THE CHILDREN WITH A GAUZE BLANKET TAKEN FROM HIS KNAPSACK SO THEY WOULD NOT BE CHILLED BY THE NIGHT AIR
I MAY NOT BE HUNGRY HAVING EATEN ALL THOSE THINGS YOU GAVE ME BUT I CONSIDER THIS EATING BUSINESS A MATTER OF TASTE AND I LIKE TO REALIZE WHAT'S GOING INTO ME OJO GAVE THE BEAST WHAT HE WANTED BUT THE SHAGGY MAN SHOOK HIS SHAGGY HEAD REPROACHFULLY AND SAID THERE WAS NO ANIMAL SO OBSTINATE OR HARD TO CONVINCE AS A WOOZY
THERE WAS A SAVORY STEW SMOKING HOT A DISH OF BLUE PEAS A BOWL OF SWEET MILK OF A DELICATE BLUE TINT AND A BLUE PUDDING WITH BLUE PLUMS IN IT
BUT HE DID NOT TELL ANYBODY WHAT THE DISCOVERY WAS AND KEPT THE IDEA TO HIMSELF
THEN SHE LAUGHED AGAIN LONG AND MERRILY AND THE GLASS CAT CREPT OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE AND SAID
ALL THESE SEEMED HAPPY-FACED PLEASANT PEOPLE WHO NODDED GRACIOUSLY TO THE STRANGERS AS THEY PASSED AND EXCHANGED WORDS OF GREETING
BUT THAT ISN'T YOUR AFFAIR YOU KNOW I'VE A RIGHT TO BE SURPRISED HAVEN'T I ASKED THE MAN MEEKLY
THE SHAGGY MAN SAID THE PEOPLE LOVED HER
FOR THEN YOU CAN LEAD US HE GOT A STRING FROM HIS POCKET AND TIED IT AROUND THE CAT'S NECK AND AFTER THAT THE CREATURE GUIDED THEM ALONG THE PATH
A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN DRESSED ALL IN RED CAME OUT TO GREET THEM AND WITH HIM WERE TWO CHILDREN ALSO IN RED COSTUMES
A POPULAR SONG YES
SURELY YOU ARE JOKING HE SAID
FIND SOME ONE WHO IS REAL WICKED AND STAY WITH HIM TILL HE REPENTS
FRANK BAUM AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED TO MY YOUNG FRIEND SUMNER HAMILTON BRITTON OF CHICAGO PROLOGUE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF DOROTHY GALE OF KANSAS AFTERWARD PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AN HUMBLE WRITER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS ONCE APPOINTED ROYAL HISTORIAN OF OZ WITH THE PRIVILEGE OF WRITING THE CHRONICLE OF THAT WONDERFUL FAIRYLAND
WE'RE ALL TIRED AND WANT TO SLEEP UNTIL MORNING
BUT MY TASK IS FINISHED AND I MUST GO AND REPORT TO OZMA THAT I'VE DONE MY DUTY LIKE A FAITHFUL POLICE FORCE A LOYAL ARMY AND AN HONEST BODY-GUARD--AS I HOPE I AM SAYING THIS HE NODDED FAREWELL TO TOLLYDIGGLE AND OJO AND WENT AWAY
I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING DECLARED THE WOOZY
FINALLY ONE OF THE CHILDREN INQUIRED WHY WE COULDN'T HEAR FROM PRINCESS DOROTHY BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPH WHICH WOULD ENABLE HER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE HISTORIAN WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE FAR-OFF LAND OF OZ WITHOUT HIS SEEING HER OR EVEN KNOWING JUST WHERE OZ IS
BUT BEYOND THE WALL WAS THE VAST CITY IT SURROUNDED AND HUNDREDS OF JEWELED SPIRES DOMES AND MINARETS FLAUNTING FLAGS AND BANNERS REARED THEIR CRESTS FAR ABOVE THE TOWERS OF THE GATEWAYS
RAZZLE-DAZZLE FIZZLE-FAZZLE
FLOATING AROUND A BEND THEY SAW AHEAD A HIGH BANK OF WATER EXTENDING ACROSS THE ENTIRE RIVER AND TOWARD THIS THEY WERE BEING IRRESISTIBLY CARRIED
THEY STOOD A LONG TIME ON THE HILLTOP FEASTING THEIR EYES ON THE SPLENDOR OF THE EMERALD CITY
HERE IN THE EMERALD CITY PEOPLE ARE TOO HAPPY AND CONTENTED EVER TO DO WRONG
YOU MUST BE DAME MARGOLOTTE THE GOOD WIFE OF DR PIPT I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME MAY WE SEE THE FAMOUS MAGICIAN MADAM HE IS VERY BUSY JUST NOW SHE SAID SHAKING HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY
GONE HE SAID
IT WAS A TWO DAYS JOURNEY FROM JACK PUMKINHEAD'S HOUSE TO THE EDGE OF THE QUADLING COUNTRY FOR NEITHER DOROTHY NOR OJO COULD WALK VERY FAST AND THEY OFTEN STOPPED BY THE WAYSIDE TO REST
THE WOMAN TOUCHED A BUTTON ON THE WALL AND LIGHTED A BIG CHANDELIER THAT HUNG SUSPENDED FROM THE CEILING FOR IT WAS GROWING DARK OUTSIDE
THAT IS WHY I GROW SUCH A GREAT FIELD OF PUMPKINS--THAT I MAY SELECT A NEW HEAD WHENEVER NECESSARY WHO CARVES THE FACES ON THEM INQUIRED THE BOY
ABOVE ALL ELSE HE COULD NOT DRIVE FROM HIS MIND THE IMPORTANT ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD COME AND HE WAS DETERMINED TO DEVOTE EVERY ENERGY TO FINDING THE THINGS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO PREPARE THE MAGIC RECIPE
THIS BOY AH
THE BOOK DOESN'T SAY BLOOD
THE TRICK RIVER 27
P'RAPS THERE ISN'T SUCH A THING OH THERE MUST BE RETURNED OJO POSITIVELY
WHEN THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED HE IS NO LONGER A PRISONER BUT A GOOD AND LOYAL CITIZEN AND EVERYONE IS GLAD THAT HE IS NOW STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST DOING WRONG
I'M GLAD TO FIND YOU HAVE DECENT BRAINS
THE PROPER THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO KEEP OUT OF MY WAY WHY THERE'S SOME SENSE IN THAT ARGUMENT ADMITTED THE SHAGGY MAN THOUGHTFULLY
THIS IS A BIG PLACE BUT IF WE HOLD FAST TO EACH OTHER WE WON'T GET LOST THEY TOOK HOLD OF HANDS AND THE HORNER LED THEM INTO A DARK CORNER WHERE HE HALTED
THAT IN WHICH OJO NOW FOUND HIMSELF HAD THREE BEDS SET ALL IN A ROW ON ONE SIDE OF IT
WE DID IT EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW WITH SATISFACTION
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME SIGHED OJO
BUT I GUESS I'LL FOOL MYSELF BY MUNCHING SOME BREAD AND CHEESE
SEVERAL MORE HAD JOINED THE GROUP BY THIS TIME AND QUITE A CROWD OF CURIOUS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SURROUNDED THE STRANGERS
THE LITTLE HOUSE OF THE QUADLINGS WAS OUT OF SIGHT ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD CRIED THEIR GOOD-BYES AND THE SCARECROW SAID IN A PLEASED VOICE
HE MIGHT HAVE CONFESSED WHAT HE HAD DONE AND THUS ALLOWED MARGOLOTTE AND HER HUSBAND TO CHANGE THE BRAINS
THIS COMMAND SO ASTONISHED ME THAT I NEARLY FAINTED FOR IT IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE HAS MERITED ARREST SINCE I CAN REMEMBER
NONSENSE SOLDIER
I'VE A FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN WHO HAS A HEART BUT I FIND I GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITHOUT ONE
YOU'RE NOT A CONCERT
SUDDENLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL LAUGHED
THEY NOW CAME UPON A CLEAR SPACE IN WHICH STOOD A ROCKY CAVE
HOW ARE YOU ALL RIGHT HE REPLIED
WALK SAID THE DONKEY
TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT THEY BEHELD A SMALL ROUND TABLE RUNNING AS FAST AS ITS FOUR SPINDLE LEGS COULD CARRY IT AND TO THE TOP WAS SCREWED FAST A PHONOGRAPH WITH A BIG GOLD HORN
I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU MY DEAR OJO AND UNC NUNKIE A NICE HOUSE JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE EMERALD CITY SHE SAID AND THERE YOU SHALL MAKE YOUR FUTURE HOME AND BE UNDER MY PROTECTION DIDN'T I SAY YOU WERE OJO THE LUCKY ASKED THE TIN WOODMAN AS EVERYONE CROWDED AROUND TO SHAKE OJO'S HAND
STILL I CANNOT SEE AS IT MATTERS MUCH FOR I WISH MY PATCHWORK GIRL TO BE USEFUL RATHER THAN ORNAMENTAL
ROLL ME OUT PLEASE
YOU WERE MADE FOR A SERVANT SCRAPS SO YOU ARE PERSONAL PROPERTY AND NOT YOUR OWN MISTRESS BOTHER DR PIPT
PRESENTLY ANOTHER IMP SEIZED SCRAPS AND BEGAN TO THROW HER ABOUT IN THE SAME WAY
HE BELIEVED THAT UNTIL DEAR UNC NUNKIE WAS RESTORED TO LIFE HE COULD FEEL NO JOY IN ANYTHING AND OFTEN HE WISHED THAT UNC COULD BE WITH HIM TO SEE ALL THE ASTONISHING THINGS OJO WAS SEEING
BUT SHE WAS NOT ANGRY
AND THAT OTHER DREADFUL PERSON--THE GIRL WHO IS ALL PATCHES--SEEMS TO BE ALIVE TOO VERY MUCH SO DECLARED SCRAPS MAKING A FACE AT HIM
WHY IT'S A FAIRYLAND EXPLAINED DOROTHY AND LOTS OF QUEER PEOPLE LIVE IN PLACES SO TUCKED AWAY THAT THOSE IN THE EMERALD CITY NEVER EVEN HEAR OF EM
YOU WILL HAVE TO VISIT BILLINA AND CONGRATULATE HER IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO DO THAT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
SCARECROW--SCRAPS
I DON'T REMEMBER IT BECAUSE EVER SINCE I COULD REMEMBER ANYTHING WE'VE LIVED RIGHT HERE IN THIS LONESOME ROUND HOUSE WITH A LITTLE GARDEN BACK OF IT AND THE THICK WOODS ALL AROUND
IF YOU PEOPLE--OR THINGS--OR GLASS SPECTACLES--OR CRAZY-QUILTS--OR WHATEVER YOU ARE GO NEAR THE EMERALD CITY YOU'LL BE ARRESTED WE'RE GOING THERE ANYHOW DECLARED SCRAPS SITTING UPON THE BENCH AND SWINGING HER STUFFED LEGS
THEN GO WEST SAID THE WOOZY
YOU WERE A SAD BUNGLE TAKEN ALL IN ALL
PRINCESS DOROTHY 17
THEY'RE PINK SCRAPS REPEATED THE GIRL
WE MUST GET HIM DOWN SOMEHOW OR OTHER WAS THE REPLY
HE HAS FAILED BUT THERE ARE OTHERS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN DR PIPT KNEW OF TO DESTROY THE CHARM OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION
THAT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK SAID HE AND IF I WERE YOU I'D TAKE ANY ORDINARY WELL AND ENCLOSE IT SO AS TO MAKE IT DARK I FEAR THAT WOULDN'T DO REPLIED THE SCARECROW
AND THERE WILL NEVER BE BUT ONE PATCHWORK GIRL FOR ANY MAGICIAN THAT SEES YOU WILL REFUSE TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU I SUPPOSE WE SHALL SEE THE TIN WOODMAN FOR WE ARE GOING TO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES SAID THE BOY
TELL HIM TO COME RIGHT UP BUT HE HAS SOME QUEER CREATURES WITH HIM--SOME OF THE QUEEREST I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON REPORTED JELLIA
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
HALT SAID THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NOT IN A STERN VOICE BUT RATHER IN A FRIENDLY TONE
BUT IS THERE EVER ANY OIL IN A MAN'S BODY THE MAGICIAN LOOKED IN THE BOOK AGAIN TO MAKE SURE
IS IT GLASS NO
BUT HE HAS LIVED ALONE IN THE HEART OF THE FOREST FOR MANY YEARS THE MAGICIAN EXPLAINED
THAT TASK IS WELL OVER OBSERVED THE SHAGGY MAN
TROUBLE WITH THE TOTTENHOTS 20
PERHAPS SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS VICTORY SO EASILY HAD NOT TOTO HELPED HER BARKING AND SNAPPING AT THE BARE LEGS OF THE IMPS UNTIL THEY WERE GLAD TO FLEE FROM HIS ATTACK
THEIR BODIES WERE BARE EXCEPT FOR SKINS FASTENED AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND THEY WORE BRACELETS ON THEIR ANKLES AND WRISTS AND NECKLACES AND GREAT PENDANT EARRINGS
THEN FOLLOW ME HE TOOK OJO'S HAND AND LED HIM FORWARD OVER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS TOWARD THE GATE
AND THEN LOOKING AHEAD OF THEM HE EXCLAIMED
WAS IT YOU WHO RESCUED ME FROM THE LEAF NONE OTHER YOU MAY BE SURE
GOODNESS ME
THERE WOULDN'T BE A PATH THOUGH IF IT DIDN'T GO SOMEWHERE SAID THE SCARECROW WRINKLING HIS FOREHEAD IN DEEP THOUGHT
I FEEL MUCH BETTER
HA HA SCRAPS TURNED AROUND AND FOUND A ROW OF GIRLS SEATED IN RADIUM CHAIRS RANGED ALONG ONE WALL OF THE ROOM
FOR YOU MUST SEARCH THROUGH SEVERAL OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF OZ IN ORDER TO GET THE THINGS I NEED I KNOW IT SIR
NICE PLACE ISN'T IT
DO THE BEST YOU CAN OJO AND WHILE YOU ARE GONE I SHALL BEGIN THE SIX YEARS JOB OF MAKING A NEW BATCH OF THE POWDER OF LIFE
BUT YOU'LL SEE THE WOOZY IF YOU'LL PLEASE RESCUE IT AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS OF COURSE SAID THE SHAGGY MAN NODDING HIS SHAGGY HEAD
AS I RULE THE WINKIE COUNTRY I CAN PROTECT MY BUTTERFLIES UNLESS I GET THE WING--JUST ONE LEFT WING SAID OJO MISERABLY I CAN'T SAVE UNC NUNKIE THEN HE MUST REMAIN A MARBLE STATUE FOREVER DECLARED THE TIN EMPEROR FIRMLY
IF THEY GET WET THE REDS AND GREENS AND YELLOWS AND PURPLES OF YOUR PATCHES MIGHT RUN INTO EACH OTHER AND BECOME JUST A BLUR--NO COLOR AT ALL YOU KNOW THEN SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'LL BE CAREFUL FOR IF I SPOILED MY SPLENDID COLORS I WOULD CEASE TO BE BEAUTIFUL PAH SNEERED THE GLASS CAT SUCH COLORS ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL
IT ALSO ADMITTED THE SHOUTS AND CEASELESS LAUGHTER OF THE IMPISH TOTTENHOTS AS THEY PLAYED OUTSIDE BUT DOROTHY AND OJO BEING WEARY FROM THEIR JOURNEY WERE SOON FAST ASLEEP
NO REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN
THE WALLS WERE PANELED WITH PLATES OF GOLD DECORATED WITH GEMS OF GREAT SIZE AND MANY COLORS AND UPON THE TILED FLOOR WERE SOFT RUGS DELIGHTFUL TO WALK UPON
THEY TELL ME MEAT IS GOING UP BUT IF I CAN MANAGE TO CATCH YOU I'M SURE IT WILL SOON BE GOING DOWN
THE MUNCHKIN BOY POINTED TO SOME WORDS PAINTED ON THE WALL OF ROCK BESIDE THEM WHICH DOROTHY HAD NOT NOTICED
JINJUR ALWAYS FIXES ME UP WHEN I GET WEATHER-WORN WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO RETURN TO THE EMERALD CITY ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
YOU MUST KEEP QUIET SAID THE CAT IN A SOFT VOICE
BUT TELL ME IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET TO THE HORNER COUNTRY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE CITY OF THE HOPPERS YES
SO AFTER A WHILE HE WAS ALL TIN AND COULD HE CHOP WOOD THEN ASKED THE BOY
NO ONE'S SWEETHEART NO ONE'S WIFE
OVER THE FENCE
WILL YOU PLEASE RESCUE MY COMPANIONS ALSO WHAT COMPANIONS ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
SINCE I ISSUED THAT LAW THE LAND OF OZ HAS BEEN FAR MORE PEACEFUL AND QUIET
I'LL GO AT ONCE TO THE FENCE AND EXPLAIN
YOUR WORLD IS A VERY UNINTERESTING PLACE
THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS TALLER THAN HE WHEN SHE STOOD UPRIGHT AND HER BODY WAS PLUMP AND ROUNDED BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO NEATLY STUFFED WITH COTTON
I COULDN'T RESPECT SUCH A BUNDLE OF SCRAPS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU DON'T THERE WILL BE MORE SCRAPS THAN YOU WILL LIKE CRIED MARGOLOTTE ANGRILY
SO THE TIN WOODMAN HAD EMPLOYED THEM IN BUILDING HIS MAGNIFICENT CASTLE WHICH WAS ALL OF TIN FROM THE GROUND TO THE TALLEST TURRET AND SO BRIGHTLY POLISHED THAT IT GLITTERED IN THE SUN'S RAYS MORE GORGEOUSLY THAN SILVER
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE IT EASY TAKE IT AS EASY AS YOU CAN AFTER WALKING SOME DISTANCE OVER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS OJO SAID HE WAS HUNGRY AND WOULD STOP TO EAT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE
DID YOU SEE NO GIRLS AS BEAUTIFUL AS I AM IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY SHE INQUIRED
DON'T THEY EVER RUN AROUND AND PLAY AND LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME NO INDEED SAID THE CHIEF
THAT PATH IS OUTSIDE THE FENCE AND MR WOOZY MAY HAVE ALL HIS LITTLE FOREST TO HIMSELF FOR ALL WE CARE BUT ONE OF OUR ERRANDS IS TO FIND A WOOZY OJO EXPLAINED
THERE IT IS
BUT IT'S A LONG WAY AROUND SO YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME
DOROTHY IS FLESH JUST AS I AM
THERE WERE NINETEEN OF THEM BY ACTUAL COUNT AND THEY WERE OF ALL SIZES FROM A TINY CHILD TO ONE ALMOST A GROWN WOMAN
WILL YOU INQUIRED DOROTHY TURNING TO THE QUADLING
THAT WOULD BE IMPROPER IN YOUNG LADIES AS WELL AS IN THOSE WHO WILL SOMETIME BECOME YOUNG LADIES
THAT'S A JOKE
THAT IS IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES AFTER THIS IT WAS JUST A LITTLE ROUGH-HOUSE THAT'S ALL SAID THE TOTTENHOT
WHERE SHALL WE GO
THE YELLOW HEN IS MIGHTY PROUD OF THOSE CHILDREN I CAN TELL YOU SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE AGREED THE SHAGGY MAN
ONE OF THE LAWS OF OZ FORBIDS ANYONE TO PICK A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
EXTREMELY SO REPLIED THE DONKEY
I'M IN NO HURRY BUT HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE WOOZY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES AND CAME TROTTING OUT OF HIS CAVE
BEWARE OF THE WOOZY THAT MEANS HE SAID THAT THERE'S A WOOZY INSIDE THAT FENCE AND THE WOOZY MUST BE A DANGEROUS ANIMAL OR THEY WOULDN'T TELL PEOPLE TO BEWARE OF IT LET'S KEEP OUT THEN REPLIED SCRAPS
MANY PEOPLE ARE LIKE THOSE STUPID HOPPERS WHO LOVE TO MAKE AN OUTSIDE SHOW
HAVE YOU ANY DARK WELLS IN YOUR CITY I THINK NOT
WAR IS DECLARED CAN'T WE GO THROUGH ASKED DOROTHY
THEY CLUNG TO THIS ANCHORAGE UNTIL THE WATER RESUMED ITS PROPER DIRECTION WHEN THEY ALLOWED THE RAFT TO DRIFT ON
THERE WERE THREE DOORS TO THE ROOM AND NONE WERE BOLTED
I'VE PINK BRAINS--YOU CAN SEE EM WORK
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR LAUGHING AT YOURSELF
NO ONE ELSE CAN DO THAT AS THEY STOOD HESITATING WHAT TO DO CHISS STIRRED AND SUDDENLY A SHOWER OF QUILLS CAME FLYING TOWARD THEM ALMOST FILLING THE AIR THEY WERE SO MANY
IN DR PIPT'S GARDEN GREW BUN-TREES CAKE-TREES CREAM-PUFF BUSHES BLUE BUTTERCUPS WHICH YIELDED EXCELLENT BLUE BUTTER AND A ROW OF CHOCOLATE-CARAMEL PLANTS
THE FACT REMAINS THAT HE IS A PRISONER SAID THE SOLDIER
HE MUST HAVE USED MORE STRENGTH THIS TIME HOWEVER FOR SCRAPS SAILED FAR OVER THE TOP OF THE FENCE AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GRAB THE SCARECROW AT ALL TUMBLED TO THE GROUND IN THE HORNER COUNTRY WHERE HER STUFFED BODY KNOCKED OVER TWO MEN AND A WOMAN AND MADE A CROWD THAT HAD COLLECTED THERE RUN LIKE RABBITS TO GET AWAY FROM HER
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO TERRIBLE TO LISTEN TO AS THE GROWL OF A WOOZY PLEASE DON'T GROWL THEN BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY
THE BOY WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED AND AS HE WALKED ALONG HE GROANED ALOUD
AS THEY DID NOT WISH TO LAND IN THIS PLACE THE BOY CUT THE ROPE WITH HIS POCKET-KNIFE AND SET THE FISH FREE JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THE RAFT FROM GROUNDING
HE MEANS EXPLAINED OJO THAT UNLESS YOUR SERVANT HAS GOOD BRAINS SHE WON'T KNOW HOW TO OBEY YOU PROPERLY NOR DO THE THINGS YOU ASK HER TO DO WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE
THE SUN SOON DRIED HER AND THE COLORS OF HER PATCHES PROVED GOOD FOR THEY DID NOT RUN TOGETHER NOR DID THEY FADE
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK NOT IN THE DAYTIME SAID THE DONKEY
I'VE JUST THIRTEEN PATCHES ON MY HEAD BUT CONTINUED OJO I'M LEFT-HANDED MANY OF OUR GREATEST MEN ARE THAT WAY ASSERTED THE EMPEROR
YES FOR A MUNCHKIN
EVEN NOW I CAN SEE NO HARM IN PICKING A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
WHY DO THEY SIT SO STILL AND ALL IN A ROW ASKED SCRAPS
HOW'S THAT FOR A JOKE EH
YOU'RE ROUND SO YOU'RE LIABLE TO DO ANYTHING ASSERTED THE WOOZY
IT IS QUITE A DISTANCE FROM HERE TO THE EMERALD CITY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN SO WE SHALL NOT GET THERE TO-DAY NOR TO-MORROW
BUT THIS INSULT WAS SO GREAT AND SO UNPROVOKED THAT OUR BRAVE MEN DECIDED TO FIGHT IN ORDER TO BE REVENGED SAID THE WOMAN
THEN THEY WALKED ON AND LEFT CHISS STANDING IN THE ROAD SULLEN AND DISCONSOLATE
IT CALLED OUT REPROACHFULLY
INSTEAD OF ENTERING THE SPLENDID EMERALD CITY AS A RESPECTABLE TRAVELER WHO WAS ENTITLED TO A WELCOME AND TO HOSPITALITY HE WAS BEING BROUGHT IN AS A CRIMINAL HANDCUFFED AND IN A ROBE THAT TOLD ALL HE MET OF HIS DEEP DISGRACE
CHEW IT AND SWALLOW IT SAID THE BOY
SO THEY SAT IN THE ROAD AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN A RATHER BEWILDERED WAY AND THEN BEGAN TO FEEL GLAD
NEVER DON'T TRAVELERS CROSS IT NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE SAID HE
WHEN IT HAS BECOME COOLED I WILL PLACE IT IN A SMALL BOTTLE
THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS SO BUSY THINKING THESE THINGS--WHICH MANY GUILTY PRISONERS HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE HIM--THAT HE SCARCELY NOTICED ALL THE SPLENDOR OF THE CITY STREETS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM CRAZY-QUILT DO YOU MEAN ME ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK SO I CAN REPLIED THE WOODCHOPPER
LET'S GO AND ASK THE PEOPLE HOW TO GET CROSS THE RIVER A QUARTER OF A MILE ALONG THE BANK STOOD A SMALL ROUND HOUSE PAINTED BRIGHT RED AND AS IT WAS ON THEIR SIDE OF THE RIVER THEY HURRIED TOWARD IT
MY EYES CAN FLASH FIRE YOU KNOW AND I CAN GROWL--A LITTLE I'M SURE YOU'LL BE SAFER HERE OZMA DECIDED AND THE WOOZY MADE NO FURTHER OBJECTION TO THE PLAN
I'VE PUT ASIDE YOUR SHARE UNC
I CANNOT BLAME YOU FOR YOUR HEARTLESS REMARK AS YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE FEELINGS OF THOSE WHO POSSESS HEARTS
IF SHE CONTINUES HER INSULTS I'LL SCRATCH OFF HER SUSPENDER-BUTTON EYES DECLARED THE CAT
CAUSE IF OTHERS HAVE GONE WE'RE PRETTY SAFE TO GO TOO TOTO LOOKED IN AND BARKED BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ENTER UNTIL THE SCARECROW HAD BRAVELY GONE FIRST
THAT'S MAGIC
THE WOOZY NEVER EVEN WINKED
CAN YOU SEE IT SCRAPS NO REPLIED THE PATCHWORK GIRL WHO WAS HOLDING FAST TO THE BOY'S ARM SO HE COULD GUIDE HER
I WISH WE COULD FIND THE DARK WELL WITHOUT SO MUCH TROUBLE SUPPOSE SAID OJO YOU WAIT HERE AND LET ME DO THE CLIMBING FOR IT'S ON MY ACCOUNT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE DARK WELL
THE OPENING WAS PERFECTLY SQUARE AND ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT A GOAT
MINE ARE PINK AND YOU CAN SEE EM WORK WELL YOU CAN'T SEE THE SCARECROW'S BRAINS WORK BUT THEY DO A LOT OF CLEVER THINKING ASSERTED THE SHAGGY MAN
BUT LONESOME--DREADFULLY LONESOME WHY DID THEY SHUT YOU UP HERE ASKED SCRAPS WHO WAS REGARDING THE QUEER SQUARE CREATURE WITH MUCH CURIOSITY
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE OF MY DEAR LITTLE BUTTERFLIES TO TREAT IN THAT WAY THEN WHAT IN THE WORLD SHALL WE DO ASKED DOROTHY
OJO KNELT AGAIN AND BY FEELING CAREFULLY IN THE DARK MANAGED TO FILL THE FLASK WITH THE UNSEEN WATER THAT WAS IN THE WELL
I S'POSE SO WELL THEY CAN'T DO THAT DECLARED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
I'VE TRIED THE LEAVES FROM THE TREES AND THE MOSSES AND CREEPING VINES BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO SUIT MY TASTE
BUT HERE ARE THREE BEDS ALL MADE UP SO WE MAY AS WELL GO TO SLEEP WHAT IS SLEEP INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
WASTED ON THAT MISERABLE PHONOGRAPH WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE SAVED MY DEAR WIFE THEN THE MAGICIAN BOWED HIS HEAD ON HIS CROOKED ARMS AND BEGAN TO CRY
BUT I DON'T BEAR GRUDGES
THERE IS ANOTHER PATH FROM THE ROCKY LOWLANDS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN THAT LEADS STRAIGHT TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE HORNER COUNTRY
NOW SAID DIKSEY WHEN THEY HAD ALL REGAINED THEIR FEET I WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THE DARK WELL IS
TELL HER YOUR STORY AND I'M SURE SHE WILL HELP YOU
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT SHAGGY MAN IF I TOOK ALL YOUR SHAGS AWAY FROM YOU IF I THREW MY SHAGS AND HURT PEOPLE YOU WOULD BE WELCOME TO CAPTURE THEM WAS THE REPLY
IS THIS REALLY A PRISON HE ASKED WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED READING
WELL WELL HE EXCLAIMED
HE BELIEVED THAT UNC HAD SEEN HIM ADD TO THE BRAINS AND UNC HAD NOT SAID A WORD AGAINST IT
NOW THEN SAID DR PIPT IN A BRISK TONE WE SHALL PERFORM ONE OF THE GREATEST FEATS OF MAGIC POSSIBLE TO MAN EVEN IN THIS MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ
THE MAN GROANED A GOOD DEAL AND SAID HE HAD OVERWORKED HIMSELF BY CHOPPING THE LOGS BUT THE SCARECROW GAVE HIM TWO MORE TABLETS THAN HE HAD PROMISED WHICH SEEMED TO COMFORT THE LAZY FELLOW
FOR MY PART I'M MADE OF PURE GLASS--EXCEPT MY JEWEL HEART AND MY PRETTY PINK BRAINS
TIN ABOUNDED IN THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND THE WINKIES WERE SAID TO BE THE MOST SKILLFUL TINSMITHS IN ALL THE WORLD
THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS LED OJO UP THE GRAVEL PATH TO THE FRONT DOOR ON WHICH HE KNOCKED
HAVE YOU NO SAID OJO
GO ON TO THE EMERALD CITY AND WHEN YOU REACH IT HAVE THE SHAGGY MAN TAKE YOU TO SEE DOROTHY
I'VE TRAVELED THIS WAY BEFORE YOU KNOW
I WAS WRONG TO MAKE YOU AS I DID FOR A MORE USELESS CONCEITED AND BRITTLE THING NEVER BEFORE EXISTED I'M NOT SO BRITTLE AS YOU THINK RETORTED THE CAT
THE SHAGGY MAN HOWEVER RELATED HIS ADVENTURES WITH THE MONSTROUS PLANTS WHICH HAD SEIZED AND ENFOLDED THE TRAVELERS AND TOLD HOW HE HAD ROBBED CHISS THE GIANT PORCUPINE OF THE QUILLS WHICH IT WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THROW AT PEOPLE
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THIS IS VERY UNKIND TREATMENT I MUST SAY WHINED THE PHONOGRAPH IN AN INJURED TONE
SUDDENLY HE STOPPED SHORT AND BENT OVER TO EXAMINE THE GROUND MORE CLOSELY
BUT I KNOW THIS GATE HAVING PASSED THROUGH IT MANY TIMES HOW THEY ALL EAGERLY INQUIRED
THE WORDS READ
HE SAT AT THE TABLE AND HAD A NAPKIN AND PLATE BUT THE SERVANTS KNEW BETTER THAN TO OFFER HIM FOOD
YOU CAN MAKE MORE POWDER OF LIFE DR PIPT YES
YOU'RE JEALOUS LAUGHED SCRAPS
RELEASE HIM SOLDIER AND LET HIM GO FREE THE PEOPLE WERE GLAD TO HEAR OZMA'S DECREE AND MURMURED THEIR APPROVAL
THE QUESTION IS WHO'S GOING TO EXPLAIN THE JOKE TO THE HORNERS
I'D NO IDEA I COULD MAKE SUCH A FINE JOKE JUST WONDERFUL ECHOED THE CHIEF
GOOD EXCLAIMED THE TIN WOODMAN
I'D LOVE TO GET A SIGHT OF SOMETHING BESIDES WOODS UNC NUNKIE TOO LITTLE SAID UNC
SO HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WIPED HIS SHAGGY FACE WITH A SHAGGY SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL WHAT A LITTLE PAINT WILL DO IF IT'S PROPERLY APPLIED IT REALLY IS WONDERFUL SHE AGREED AS THEY ALL TOOK THEIR SEATS
WHERE IS THE PATCHWORK GIRL NOW IN MY ROOM REPLIED DOROTHY
I'M NOT STUCK ON THAT PICKET ANY MORE THE HORNERS BEGAN TO LAUGH THINKING THIS WAS A JOKE BUT THE SCARECROW SHOOK HIMSELF AND PATTED HIS STRAW A LITTLE AND SAID TO DOROTHY
AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS ARRIVED WITH OJO THE SHAGGY MAN ENTERED FROM A SIDE DOOR ESCORTING THE PATCHWORK GIRL THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT
I'M CALLED OJO THE UNLUCKY YOU KNOW THAT'S NONSENSE KIDDIE RETORTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL CHEERFULLY
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE JOKE COMES IN SHE SAID AND TOOK THE HOPPERS AWAY TO A DISTANCE WHERE THE HORNERS COULD NOT HEAR THEM
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE HAD HER FACE ALL PINK SUGGESTED THE BOY
THINK ALL YOU WANT TO
NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN THE ROOM EXCEPT THE BOY AND BUNGLE
SO NOW THEY WENT ON AGAIN AND COMING PRESENTLY TO A POND OF MUDDY WATER THEY TIED A HEAVY STONE TO THE BUNDLE OF QUILLS AND SUNK IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND TO AVOID CARRYING IT FARTHER
THIS SANDY DESERT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US AND WE'RE NOT DISTURBED HERE DECLARED THE TOTTENHOT
WE USE LADDERS IN OUR MINES SAID HE
A LADDER'S THE THING HAVE YOU ONE ASKED DOROTHY
BUT THIS IS A LONELY PLACE AND NO GOOD MEAT HAS PASSED BY MY CAVE FOR MANY YEARS
I CAN'T SEE THAT MY COLORS HAVE FADED A PARTICLE AS YET
IF I GET TIRED LOOKING AT HER PATCHED FACE I CAN WHITEWASH IT HAS SHE ANY BRAINS ASKED OJO
LISTEN HE SAID HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR SILENCE
I AM WELL AWARE THAT OJO HAS UNDERTAKEN A SERIOUS TASK SCRAPS LAUGHED AND RESUMING HER DANCE SHE SAID
WHY CAN'T THE MAN MAKE US A RAFT ASKED OJO
BUT I HAVE NOTICED THAT THOSE WHO CONTINUALLY DREAD ILL LUCK AND FEAR IT WILL OVERTAKE THEM HAVE NO TIME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY GOOD FORTUNE THAT COMES THEIR WAY
IT'S IN THE SOUTH COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS
SHE'S ALIVE AND HER NAME IS SCRAPS
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY ANYHOW
THAT'S WHAT THE RECIPE CALLS FOR HE REPLIED AND OF COURSE WE MUST GET EVERYTHING THAT IS CALLED FOR OR THE CHARM WON'T WORK
BUT NOW OZMA HAS MADE HER A PRINCESS AND DOROTHY'S AUNT EM AND UNCLE HENRY ARE HERE TOO HERE THE SHAGGY MAN UTTERED A LONG SIGH AND THEN HE CONTINUED
BUT THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO CONTINUED DOROTHY
BUT WHETHER I'M AWAKE OR DREAMING I CAN'T BE POSITIVE SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE I LIVE
WE'RE GOING JUST THE WAY WE DON'T WANT TO GO SAID DOROTHY AND I GUESS THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO GET TO LAND BEFORE WE'RE CARRIED ANY FARTHER BUT THEY COULD NOT GET TO LAND
PLEASE GROWL BUT YOU FORGET RETURNED THE WOOZY
I THINK IT TOOK YOU A WHOLE YEAR UNC TO SAY AS MUCH AS I'VE JUST SAID ABOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND HIS WIFE
BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH-AND-MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
FOLLOW ME AND STEP CAREFULLY AND I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE PLACE HE WENT IN FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME OJO AND THEN DOROTHY WITH THE SCARECROW BEHIND HER
WHAT DO YOU THINK CHAMPION ASKED ONE OF THEM
ALL RIGHT HE SAID AGAIN IN A GLAD VOICE
WHAT IS A SERVANT SHE ASKED
IN THAT WAY YOU CAN DO SOME GOOD IN THE WORLD THE MUSIC THING TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AND TROTTED DOWN A SIDE PATH TOWARD A DISTANT MUNCHKIN VILLAGE
THE OTHERS THEN STOPPED TOO AND WALKED BACK TO THE BOY
WE WILL GO TO PRINCESS DOROTHY AND TELL HER YOUR TROUBLES AND THEN WE WILL LET HER TALK TO OZMA
SHE'S A WISE LITTLE GIRL OUR RULER AND SHE MAY FIND A WAY TO HELP OJO SAVE HIS UNC NUNKIE SO THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE PARTY STARTED ON THE JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY WHICH THEY REACHED IN DUE TIME WITHOUT ANY IMPORTANT ADVENTURE
AND NOW I'LL INTRODUCE A BEAST THAT EV'RYONE ADORES THE COWARDLY LION SHAKES WITH FEAR MOST EV'RY TIME HE ROARS AND YET HE DOES THE BRAVEST THINGS THAT ANY LION MIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT COWARDICE IS NOT CONSIDERED RIGHT
BUT I HAD NO PINK CLOTH REPLIED THE WOMAN
YOU MUNCHKIN PEOPLE ALL STRUT AROUND IN YOUR STUPID BLUE COLOR WHILE I YOU ARE WRONG IN CALLING ME A MUNCHKIN INTERRUPTED THE DONKEY FOR I WAS BORN IN THE LAND OF MO AND CAME TO VISIT THE LAND OF OZ ON THE DAY IT WAS SHUT OFF FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD
AND I CAN JUMP VERY HIGH WHICH IS THE REASON THEY MADE SUCH A TALL FENCE TO KEEP ME IN
I FIND I LEARN MUCH MORE BY TRAVELING THAN BY STAYING AT HOME DURING THIS CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEEN WALKING UP THE STEEP PATHWAY AND NOW FOUND THEMSELVES WELL UP ON THE MOUNTAIN
AND NOW WE ARE FREE TO GO ON OUR WAY MISTER YOOP IS VERY IMPOLITE DECLARED SCRAPS
IT'S PROB'LY BRITTLE AND MIGHT BREAK IF IT BUMPED AGAINST ANYTHING WOOF SAID TOTO AND THAT MEANT HE UNDERSTOOD
YOU MAY BE MADE DEAF IF SO WE WILL FORGIVE YOU VERY WELL THEN SAID THE WOOZY IN A DETERMINED VOICE AND ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARD THE GIANT PORCUPINE
MY BODY IS GOOD SOLID HICKORY I ADORE STUFFING SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
HO HO
SHE'S SO QUEER AND--AND--UNCOMMON SHE'S HALF CRAZY I THINK ADDED THE SHAGGY MAN
INSTEAD OF BEING MARBLE THE WALLS AND ROOF WERE OF DULL GRAY ROCK AND THE SQUARE HOUSES WERE PLAINLY MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL
MARGOLOTTE WAS AN EXCELLENT COOK AND GAVE THEM A FINE BREAKFAST
AH WANTS MAH LULU MAH COAL-BLACK LULU
IT WAS A LONG WALK BUT A PLEASANT ONE AND THEY DID NOT MIND IT A BIT
I THINK THE BOY HID IT IN HIS BASKET AND THEN GAVE THE BASKET TO YOU
I THINK I SHALL TAKE YOU DIRECTLY TO DOROTHY AS THE SCARECROW ADVISED AND THE GLASS CAT AND THE WOOZY MAY COME WITH US
MY TREMENDOUS GROWL WOULD ALSO FRIGHTEN YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE HEART DISEASE YOU MIGHT EXPIRE TRUE
OJO'S SEARCHING FOR A CHARM CAUSE UNC NUNKIE'S COME TO HARM
AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM HE CONTINUED
ALL GLASS AND ALIVE YES SAID OJO
THE SOUNDS WERE LOW AND SWEET AND ALTHOUGH THEY REACHED OJO'S EARS VERY FAINTLY THEY WERE CLEAR AND HARMONIOUS
THEN TURNING THESE OVER SHE CAME UPON THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER WHICH THE BOY HAD PLUCKED
BUT THAT POOR PATCHED THING WILL HATE HERSELF WHEN SHE'S ONCE ALIVE CONTINUED THE CAT
I'M NOT A CRAZY-QUILT
BUT NO LAW IS EVER MADE WITHOUT SOME PURPOSE AND THAT PURPOSE IS USUALLY TO PROTECT ALL THE PEOPLE AND GUARD THEIR WELFARE
THE TIN WOODMAN'S TIN CASTLE
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTES REMARKED THE PUMPKINHEAD WITH A SIGH
THE MAGICIAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND THERE ALSO WERE THE CHAMPION AND MANY OTHER HOPPERS
SCRAPS MAY LIVE IN THE PALACE OR WHEREVER SHE PLEASES AND BE NOBODY'S SERVANT BUT HER OWN THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
GIVE ME SOME OJO HANDED HER A BIT OF THE BREAD AND SHE PUT IT IN HER MOUTH
KEEP QUIET STRANGERS AND GO TO BED THE CAT WHICH COULD SEE IN THE DARK LOOKED SHARPLY AROUND FOR THE OWNER OF THE VOICE BUT COULD DISCOVER NO ONE ALTHOUGH THE VOICE HAD SEEMED CLOSE BESIDE THEM
BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF INCURRING THEIR ANGER
OF COURSE THEY ANSWERED LOOKING VERY WISE
AND IN THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY SHE EXCLAIMED
WALKING IS A TERRIBLY AWKWARD WAY TO TRAVEL
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR ANYONE TO WORK MAGIC EXCEPT GLINDA THE GOOD AND THE ROYAL WIZARD OF OZ
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ALL FAST COLORS OJO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY
DIKSEY WENT TO ONE OF THESE HOLES AND SAID
OH YES
OH YES
DOROTHY ONCE TRAVELED THE OTHER WAY AND MET WITH MORE DANGERS THAN WE DID
OZMA THINKS THAT ONE WHO HAS COMMITTED A FAULT DID SO BECAUSE HE WAS NOT STRONG AND BRAVE
PERHAPS IF THE SCARECROW HAD BEEN A TRIFLE HEAVIER HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO THROW AND WOULD HAVE GONE A GREATER DISTANCE
ONCE IN A WHILE I MAKE A GOOD JOKE AS YOU HAVE HEARD AND THEN I PERMIT MY DAUGHTERS TO LAUGH DECOROUSLY
BUT I'M GLAD--I'M AWFULLY GLAD!--THAT I'M JUST WHAT I AM AND NOTHING ELSE BE QUIET WILL YOU CRIED THE FRANTIC MAGICIAN
IS THAT THE WAY WE GO ASKED BUNGLE ANXIOUSLY
WHEN YOU ARE RESTED FRIENDS LET US GO ON OUR WAY DURING THE AFTERNOON THE TRAVELERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A LONELY AND UNINHABITED PART OF THE COUNTRY
I'M GOING TO TRY TO SAVE YOU UNC HE SAID JUST AS IF THE MARBLE IMAGE COULD HEAR HIM
THERE WAS STILL ANOTHER BEAST PRESENT BUT THIS ONE DOROTHY HELD IN HER ARMS FOR IT WAS HER CONSTANT COMPANION THE LITTLE DOG TOTO
CAN'T YOU TAKE EM OUT THEN AND REPLACE EM WITH PEBBLES SO THAT I WON'T FEEL ABOVE MY STATION IN LIFE ASKED THE CAT PLEADINGLY
ONCE TWO OF THOSE DREADFUL KALIDAHS WITH BODIES LIKE BEARS AND HEADS LIKE TIGERS CAME HERE FROM THE FOREST TO ATTACK US
NO CAN'T I DANCE TILL MORNING IF I WANT TO ASKED SCRAPS
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS THEY STOPPED AT A FARMHOUSE WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE VERY HOSPITABLE AND INVITED THEM TO DINNER
THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF AND LAUGHED
THE ROOF OF THE DOME WAS OF COLORED GLASS WORKED INTO BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS
WHO ARE THE HOPPERS ASKED DOROTHY
ONE OF US MADE A JOKE THAT THE STUPID HOPPERS COULDN'T SEE THE CHIEF SMILED AS HE SAID THIS AND THE SMILE MADE HIS FACE LOOK QUITE JOLLY
LIKE A SONG BIRD
IF YOU WENT ALONE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU OJO SO THEY BEGAN THE CLIMB AND FOUND IT INDEED DIFFICULT FOR A WAY
A HORNER SAID THEY HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING THAN WE BECAUSE THEY'VE ONLY ONE LEG
YOU ARE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO MY PARTNER INDEED ASSERTED THE DONKEY RUBBING HIS FRONT HOOFS TOGETHER AS IF HIGHLY PLEASED
AND WE DIDN'T INSULT THEM AT ALL
BUT DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE AND YOU MUST GO DIRECTLY TO BED RETURNED THE VOICE
I REMEMBER THAT UNC NUNKIE AND MY HUSBAND USED TO BE FRIENDS MANY YEARS AGO SHE SAID SO PERHAPS THEY WILL BE GLAD TO MEET AGAIN
A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
ON HIS HEAD WAS A GREEN VELVET HAT WITH A JEWELED BAND WHICH WAS ALL SHAGGY AROUND THE BRIM
MY IDEA BEGAN THE SCARECROW WHEN THEY HAD HALTED IS TO MAKE A DASH PAST THE CAVE GOING ON A RUN HE'D GRAB US SAID DOROTHY
THERE WERE MANY WINDOWS AND THEY HAD NO LOCKS
OZMA AND HER FRIENDS 18
HE IS UNFORTUNATE IN TWO WAYS--BECAUSE HE HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND BECAUSE HE IS DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY
SO LET'S WAIT UNTIL MORNING BEFORE WE TACKLE IT THEY AGREED TO THIS AND OJO FOUND SOME BRUSHWOOD IN THE CABIN AND MADE A FIRE ON THE HEARTH
HE FOUND A LOOSE END OF THE CLOTHESLINE WHICH FASTENED THE LOGS TOGETHER AND TAKING A GOLD NAIL FROM HIS POCKET HE BENT IT NEARLY DOUBLE TO FORM A HOOK AND TIED IT TO THE END OF THE LINE
HE ALSO MADE SCRAPS COME TO LIFE SO SHE COULD DO THE HOUSEWORK FOR HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE THEN WHY DID YOU BOTH LEAVE HIM ASKED DOROTHY
YOU SEE IT IS KINDNESS THAT MAKES ONE STRONG AND BRAVE
YOU WERE BAD ENOUGH BEFORE SAID THE MAGICIAN RESENTFULLY
HE HANDED HIS BASKET TO SCRAPS AND SAID
I HADN'T NOTICED YOU BEFORE
WHY ARE WE SO POOR THE OLD MUNCHKIN TURNED AND LOOKED AT OJO
I'M PATCHWORK SHE SAID
THEY ALL BENT OVER THE BENCH ON WHICH THE PATCHWORK GIRL RECLINED
CAN'T YOU SEE
WHY HE SEES A HOUSE OVER THERE CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL
GLINDA HAS TAUGHT OUR OLD WIZARD A GOOD MANY CLEVER THINGS SO HE IS NO LONGER A HUMBUG THEY WALKED A LITTLE WHILE IN SILENCE AND THEN OJO SAID
FROM THE MOUTH OF THE VASE A PLANT SPROUTED SLOWLY GROWING BEFORE THEIR EYES UNTIL IT BECAME A BEAUTIFUL BUSH AND ON THE TOPMOST BRANCH APPEARED THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER WHICH OJO HAD UNFORTUNATELY PICKED
YOU ARE MAKING ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH NOISE CRIED THE VOICE THEY HAD HEARD BEFORE
THE FISH WAS FRIGHTENED AND IT WAS A STRONG SWIMMER
AT A SIGN FROM OZMA THE SOLDIER REMOVED OJO'S WHITE ROBE AND THE BOY STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL WHO WAS TO DECIDE HIS PUNISHMENT
OZMA'S PRISONER 16
THEY SAID GOOD-BYE TO THE WISE DONKEY AND THE FOOLISH OWL AND AT ONCE RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
THAT WOULD MAKE HER DISCONTENTED AND UNHAPPY FOR OF COURSE SHE MUST ALWAYS BE A SERVANT OJO WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AS HE LISTENED TO THIS AND THE BOY BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD DONE WRONG IN ADDING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF BRAINS TO THE LOT MARGOLOTTE HAD PREPARED FOR THE SERVANT
BECAUSE THE HORNS OF OUR ENEMIES ARE SHARP AND IN BATTLE THEY WILL TRY TO STICK THOSE HORNS INTO OUR WARRIORS SHE REPLIED
HIP HOPPER THE CHAMPION 22
THE GLASS CAT SNARLED AND HID UNDER THE TABLE AND SO IT WAS THAT WHEN THE POWERFUL LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION WAS SPILLED IT FELL ONLY UPON THE WIFE OF THE MAGICIAN AND THE UNCLE OF OJO
THE HOLE WAS JUST BIG ENOUGH TO PERMIT THEM TO WALK UPRIGHT ALTHOUGH THE SCARECROW BEING MUCH THE TALLER OF THE PARTY OFTEN HAD TO BEND HIS HEAD TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE TOP
AND IT WAS A POOR JOB BECAUSE YOU ARE USELESS AND A BOTHER TO ME
THE SHAGGY MAN ALSO HAD HIS EYES CLOSED BUT MARCHED STRAIGHT AHEAD NEVERTHELESS AND AFTER HE HAD TAKEN ONE HUNDRED STEPS BY ACTUAL COUNT HE STOPPED AND SAID
THE SHAPE DOESN'T MAKE A THING HONEST DOES IT OF COURSE IT DOES RETURNED THE WOOZY VERY DECIDEDLY
BUT WHAT ROAD SHALL I TAKE WAS THE BOY'S NEXT QUESTION
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A BOY BEFORE
WE LIVE OUR LIVES IN THE DARK MOSTLY AND SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME
BUT YOU MUST KNOW UNC
TWOULD MAKE MY SONG SO VERY LONG THAT YOU WOULD SOON BE TIRED
STILL SAID HE I PREFER NOT TO DO PICKET DUTY AGAIN
IT'S A KIND OFFER BUT WE CAN'T STOP
AT THIS MOMENT YOU ARE LUCKY SAID SHE
TAKE CARE OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND BRING HER SAFELY BACK FOR SHE OUGHT TO PROVE USEFUL TO MY WIFE
ALL THE HOUSES IN THIS CITY ARE DECORATED WITH IT JUST THE SAME AS MINE IS WHY DON'T YOU USE IT ON YOUR STREETS THEN AND THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSES TO MAKE THEM AS PRETTY AS THEY ARE WITHIN SHE INQUIRED
I SHALL TAKE YOU ALL APART MR PHONY AND SCATTER YOUR PIECES FAR AND WIDE OVER THE COUNTRY AS A MATTER OF KINDNESS TO THE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT MEET IF ALLOWED TO RUN AROUND LOOSE
THE BEAST LISTENED WITH ATTENTION AND WHEN OJO HAD FINISHED THE RECITAL IT SAID WITH A SIGH
THEN I MUST HAVE THREE HAIRS FROM THE TIP OF A WOOZY'S TAIL AND A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY OJO LOOKED GRAVE AT THIS
BY AND BY THEY REACHED A HOUSE BUILT JUST BESIDE THE GREAT CITY WALL BUT IN A QUIET RETIRED PLACE
IF HIS JAILOR WAS WILLING TO TRUST HIM IN THIS WAY HE WOULD NOT BETRAY HER TRUST AND MOREOVER A HOT SUPPER WAS BEING PREPARED FOR HIM AND HIS PRISON WAS VERY PLEASANT AND COMFORTABLE
ANYTHING SPECIAL I CAN MAKE MY EYES FLASH FIRE--REAL FIRE--WHEN I'M ANGRY
RUN FAST OR YOU ARE LOST OJO TURNED AND SAW THE WOOZY RUNNING SWIFTLY UP THE ROAD
I STILL AM ABLE TO GRIND OUT DELICIOUS MUSIC
TOWARD EVENING THEY REACHED A CRYSTAL SPRING WHICH GUSHED FROM A TALL ROCK BY THE ROADSIDE AND NEAR THIS SPRING STOOD A DESERTED CABIN
I CAN'T SEE THAT OLD UNC AND MARGOLOTTE ARE WORTH ALL THIS TROUBLE ANYHOW BUT OJO DID NOT FEEL THAT WAY
HE SEEMED VERY MUCH SURPRISED WHEN OJO AND SCRAPS AND THE GLASS CAT CAME OUT OF THE WOODS BUT AS THE PATCHWORK GIRL APPROACHED NEARER HE SAT DOWN UPON A BENCH AND LAUGHED SO HARD THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK FOR A LONG TIME
THE WINKIE COUNTRY WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND ACROSS THE FIELDS THEY COULD SEE AFAR THE SILVERY SHEEN OF THE TIN CASTLE
WHEN SHE IS ALIVE SHE WILL DO ALL OUR WORK AND MIND THE HOUSE
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY BUNGLE REMARKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THEN WE'RE NOT SAVAGES
IT RAN DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROAD AND ENCLOSED A SMALL FOREST OF TALL TREES SET CLOSE TOGETHER
IS ANYTHING HURTING YOU INQUIRED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A KINDLY TONE FOR THE EMPEROR WAS WITH THE PARTY
THEN IF I DON'T FIND ANYTHING I'LL COME BACK AND JOIN YOU NO REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL SHAKING HER HEAD POSITIVELY WE'LL ALL GO TOGETHER FOR THAT WAY WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER
NEVER MIND ALL THAT SAID DOROTHY
THEY RAN AROUND A BEND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND FOUND A MAN SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE AND LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL
HER VERY BEST FRIEND WAS THE BEAUTIFUL OZMA OF OZ WHO LOVED DOROTHY SO WELL THAT SHE KEPT HER IN HER OWN PALACE SO AS TO BE NEAR HER
NOT ALWAYS FOR SHE HAS MANY OTHER THINGS TO DO
BUT SCRAPS WAS MUCH DISMAYED AND THE SCARECROW TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE WATER OFF THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S PATCHES AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE TO
POLITENESS IS HIS GREAT HOBBY AND HE CLAIMS THAT IF A CHILD IS ALLOWED TO DO AN IMPOLITE THING ONE CANNOT EXPECT THE GROWN PERSON TO DO ANYTHING BETTER IS IT IMPOLITE TO ROMP AND SHOUT AND BE JOLLY ASKED SCRAPS
I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY HE SAID OR WE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET THAT DREADFUL PORCUPINE
THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY PERSON DYING IN THE LAND OF OZ BUT HE KNEW ONE COULD SUFFER A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
DON'T YOU FIND IT VERY ANNOYING TO BE SO CROOKED HE ASKED
BUT JUST AS THEY WERE CONGRATULATING THEMSELVES UPON THE PROGRESS THEY HAD MADE THEY CAME UPON A BROAD RIVER WHICH SWEPT ALONG BETWEEN HIGH BANKS AND HERE THE ROAD ENDED AND THERE WAS NO BRIDGE OF ANY SORT TO ALLOW THEM TO CROSS
IT'S MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHO'S COMING FOR I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE
ONCE THE CHILD HAD LIVED ON THE KANSAS PRAIRIES BUT SHE SEEMED MARKED FOR ADVENTURE FOR SHE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE LAND OF OZ BEFORE SHE CAME TO LIVE THERE FOR GOOD
HE'S JUST A COMMON UNITED STATES DOG
I KNOW FOR I'VE TRAVELED IN OZ A GOOD DEAL AND SO HAS THE SCARECROW YES ADMITTED THE STRAW MAN I'VE BEEN CONSIDERABLE OF A TRAVELER IN MY TIME AND I LIKE TO EXPLORE STRANGE PLACES
ONCE YOU COULD SEE SANDY DESERT ALL AROUND OZ
IF THAT ISN'T FUNNY ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS YOU'RE NOT SEEING MUCH OF THE WORLD YET MY POOR INNOCENT SCRAPS REMARKED THE CAT
OJO SEEMS GLAD TO HAVE THE OIL FOR SOME REASON YES DECLARED THE MUNCHKIN BOY I AM GLAD
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THEY DREW NEAR TO THE WONDERFUL TIN CASTLE OF THE EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES AND OJO AND SCRAPS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE WERE FILLED WITH AMAZEMENT
I HOPE HIS FAULT IS AS SMALL AS HIMSELF SAID THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE
THE BEAST WAS DARK BLUE IN COLOR AND HIS FACE WAS NOT FIERCE NOR FEROCIOUS IN EXPRESSION BUT RATHER GOOD-HUMORED AND DROLL
IF YOU GET WET YOU'LL BE SOGGY AND CAN'T WALK
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE TIN WOODMAN OBJECTS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAGES IN ALL OZ
I THINK WE ARE DECLARED OJO
ME ASKED THE HOPPER
THEREFORE LET US TAKE THE JAUNT IN AN EASY MANNER
I ALWAYS WHISTLE AS I GO BY EM AND SO THEY ALWAYS LET ME ALONE
AH WANTS MAH LOO-LOO LOO-LOO LOO-LOO LU
ONLY WHEN ANGRY DO I UTTER MY FEARFUL EAR-SPLITTING SOUL-SHUDDERING GROWL
GLINDA ALSO KNEW THAT OJO WOULD FAIL TO FIND ALL THE THINGS HE SOUGHT SO SHE SENT FOR OUR WIZARD AND INSTRUCTED HIM WHAT TO DO
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE WHY ONE OF THEM MADE A VERY INSULTING REMARK ABOUT MY PEOPLE
LACKING SENSE AND LOVING FUN SHE'LL BE SNUBBED BY EVERYONE QUITE A COMPLIMENT
CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE HE ASKED REPROACHFULLY
SOMETIMES IT FLOWS ONE WAY AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER THEY HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER HIM FOR THE RAFT WAS SWEPT PAST THE HOUSE AND A LONG DISTANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
AH SAID HE NODDING WISELY
COME IN CALLED A DEEP BASS VOICE
THE PATCHWORK GIRL IS NEW--THREE OR FOUR DAYS OLD--BUT I'VE LIVED WITH DR PIPT FOR YEARS
BUT PRESENTLY IN CREEPING OVER THE BIG CRAGS THEY FOUND A PATH AT THEIR FEET WHICH WOUND IN AND OUT AMONG THE MASSES OF ROCK AND WAS QUITE SMOOTH AND EASY TO WALK UPON
RUSTY PERHAPS TELL ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL EARNESTLY DO ALL THOSE QUEER PEOPLE YOU MENTION REALLY LIVE IN THE LAND OF OZ EVERY ONE OF EM
THE SIX-LEAVED CLOVER I--I YOU MAY TAKE IT AND KEEP IT SAID OZMA
WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT ANYWAY MR MAGIC-MAKER THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION HAS ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN UPON MY DEAR WIFE AND UNC NUNKIE AND TURNED THEM INTO MARBLE HE SADLY REPLIED
DEAR ME EXCLAIMED OJO STARING HARD
IN MY OFFICIAL POSITIONS I'VE HAD NOTHING TO DO FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS--SO LONG THAT I BEGAN TO FEAR I WAS ABSOLUTELY USELESS--UNTIL TO-DAY
FROM THE WAY YOU'RE ACTING I GUESS THE DOSE WAS BADLY MIXED SCRAPS HASN'T ENOUGH BRAINS TO HURT HER SO DON'T WORRY REMARKED THE CAT WHICH WAS TROTTING ALONG IN A VERY DAINTY AND GRACEFUL MANNER
IN THAT CASE I'VE SOLVED THE RIDDLE CRIED SCRAPS DANCING WITH GLEE
CHAPTER ELEVEN A GOOD FRIEND SOON THE ENTIRE PARTY WAS GATHERED ON THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS QUITE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE BEAUTIFUL BUT TREACHEROUS PLANTS
I AM SORRY I HAVE ACTED WRONGLY AND BROKEN YOUR LAW
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF FOOD GIVE ME A NIBBLE AND I WILL TRY IT
AND IT IS TRUE REPLIED OJO GRATEFULLY
THERE WERE FIVE THINGS I HAD TO GET AND I HAVE FOUND FOUR OF THEM
HE BROKE OFF SOME OF THE BREAD AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE LOAF JUST AS LARGE AS IT WAS BEFORE
DON'T TELL EM I CAN SING OR THEY'D WANT ME TO MAKE RECORDS FOR THAT AWFUL PHONOGRAPH
BUT I THINK IT IS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO BE BOTTLED HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER-BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
I'M TRANSPARENT AND SCRAPS ISN'T
FOR GLINDA HAS A BIG BOOK IN WHICH IS RECORDED EVERY EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST THE MOMENT THAT IT HAPPENS AND SO OF COURSE THE BOOK WOULD TELL HER ABOUT THE WIRELESS MESSAGE
THAT'LL DO SAID THE WOOZY AT LAST
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK AFTER WALKING A LONG TIME THEY CAME TO A LITTLE BROOK THAT TRICKLED ACROSS THE PATH AND HERE OJO SAT DOWN TO REST AND EAT SOMETHING FROM HIS BASKET
IT CONTINUED TO MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT HAD BEEN GOING
BUT I LIKE IT NEVERTHELESS WHAT IS QUEER ABOUT IT ASKED SCRAPS
YOU WERE ASLEEP EXPLAINED THE SCARECROW
THIS WAR WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IS A TERRIBLE THING REMARKED ONE OF THE WOMEN
TOO BAD SHAGGY MAN ISN'T IT WHILE THEY WERE TALKING SCRAPS HAD BEEN ROAMING AROUND THE ROOM AND LOOKING AT ALL THE PRETTY THINGS IT CONTAINED
THEY COULD SEE LITTLE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE PASSING BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BANKS AND THEY MET WITH NO BOATS OR OTHER CRAFT UPON THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER
THAT IS WHY I AM BRIGHT AND CONTENTED OJO WHILE YOU ARE BLUE AND SAD I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE IN GIVING YOU SO MANY SORTS OF BRAINS OBSERVED THE BOY
I'VE SEEN QUEER THINGS SINCE I CAME TO THE LAND OF OZ SAID HE BUT NEVER ANYTHING QUEERER THAN THIS BAND OF ADVENTURERS
MAY I GO IF YOU WISH TO REPLIED OZMA
YOU'RE A STRANGER HERE MISS PATCHES AND SO YOU DON'T KNOW THAT NOTHING CAN BE HIDDEN FROM OUR POWERFUL RULER'S MAGIC PICTURE--NOR FROM THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE HUMBLE WIZARD OF OZ
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PATH BEFORE THEM AT THE BEGINNING SO THEY COULD NOT MISS THEIR WAY AND FOR A TIME THEY WALKED THROUGH THE THICK FOREST IN SILENT THOUGHT EACH ONE IMPRESSED WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADVENTURE THEY HAD UNDERTAKEN
THE CROOKED MAGICIAN 3
I'LL NOT FORGET NICK CHOPPER THE WOODMAN MADE OF TIN WHOSE TENDER HEART THINKS KILLING TIME IS QUITE A DREADFUL SIN NOR OLD PROFESSOR WOGGLE-BUG WHO'S HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND LOOKS SO BIG TO EVERYONE THAT HE IS FILLED WITH PRIDE
OF COURSE REAL FIRE
THE PHONOGRAPH NOW BEGAN TO PLAY A JERKY JUMBLE OF SOUNDS WHICH PROVED SO BEWILDERING THAT AFTER A MOMENT SCRAPS STUFFED HER PATCHWORK APRON INTO THE GOLD HORN AND CRIED
THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HIS ENTHUSIASM BUT THE SCARECROW WAS QUITE SERIOUS
MAKE FRIENDS WITH EUREKA AND YOU'LL BE SOLID AT THE PALACE I'M SOLID NOW
WHO WANTS TO WALK EXCLAIMED THE MAN
THERE BEING NO WAY TO ARREST THE PROGRESS OF THE RAFT THEY CLUNG FAST TO THE LOGS AND LET THE RIVER SWEEP THEM ON
BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE WANT TO GO WHERE THE PATH DOES IT'S UNDERGROUND
YES SAID THE SCARECROW REFLECTIVELY BUT WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CRUSH OR INJURE ANY OF THESE LILIES WHY NOT ASKED OJO
WE HAVE NO WEAPONS EXPLAINED THE CHAMPION
NO ONE SPOKE FOR A LONG TIME
I DID IT TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE AND THOUGHT I WOULD NOT BE FOUND OUT
NEITHER WERE ANY OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT FOR IT WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN TWO HOUSES
IT IS PERFECTION SHE DECLARED
BUT I ADMIRE THE OWL FOR THE REASON THAT SHE IS POSITIVELY FOOLISH
BUT I WON'T PROMISE YOU WILL LAND ON YOUR FEET NO MATTER ABOUT THAT RETURNED THE SCARECROW
BETTER CRAWL INTO A RAG-BAG AND HIDE THERE
I'VE HAD ENOUGH THINGS THROWN AT ME SINCE I LEFT YOU TO STOCK A DEPARTMENT STORE AND FURNISH HALF A DOZEN BARGAIN-COUNTERS ARE YOU SO BROKEN UP THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY ASKED SCRAPS
HE WAS SO DISHEARTENED THAT HE SAT DOWN UPON A STUMP AND BEGAN TO CRY
THEN LISTEN AT ONCE THE MACHINE BEGAN TO PLAY AND IN A FEW MINUTES OJO PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS EARS TO SHUT OUT THE SOUNDS AND THE CAT SNARLED AND SCRAPS BEGAN TO LAUGH
THEN WHEN AT LAST YOU GET TO THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE HE CAN SURELY FIND SOME WAY TO PULL OUT THOSE THREE HAIRS OJO WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS SUGGESTION
THEY'RE HORNERS
SO I'M WILLING TO HELP HIS UNCLE
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US WHAT DID OLD MOMBI THE WITCH DO WITH THE POWDER OF LIFE YOUR HUSBAND GAVE HER ASKED THE BOY
OZMA TOOK A CHAIR WHICH JELLIA JAMB WHEELED FORWARD FOR THE RULER AND BACK OF HER STOOD THE SCARECROW THE TIN WOODMAN AND DOROTHY AS WELL AS THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER
PUT ME TO THE TEST MY DEAR PATCHES AND I'LL PROVE MY WISDOM IN THE WINK OF AN EYE WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO GET TO THE EMERALD CITY ASKED OJO
BUT AS IT WAS INSTEAD OF GOING OVER THE FENCE HE LANDED JUST ON TOP OF IT AND ONE OF THE SHARP PICKETS CAUGHT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK AND HELD HIM FAST PRISONER
BUT THIS SCARECROW OF WHOM I SPEAK IS VERY INTELLIGENT
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO GAY AND GAUDY IT IS MY BEAUTY THAT DAZZLES YOU SHE ASSERTED
THE NEXT TIME THE RIVER BACKED UP THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO SEIZE THE BRANCH OF A TREE THAT OVERHUNG THE WATER AND THEY ALL ASSISTED HIM TO HOLD FAST AND PREVENT THE RAFT FROM BEING CARRIED BACKWARD
IT CAME TO LIFE AND IS NOW OUR DEAR FRIEND JACK PUMPKINHEAD
HAS SOMETHING PLEASED YOU ASKED OJO WHO WAS FEELING SOLEMN AND JOYLESS THROUGH THINKING UPON HIS UNCLE'S SAD FATE
THE GIANT PORCUPINE 13
COME ON IN DOROTHY HANDED TOTO TO THE BOY AND THEN CLIMBED IN HERSELF
CHAPTER FIVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT IT WILL TAKE A FEW MINUTES FOR THIS POWDER TO DO ITS WORK REMARKED THE MAGICIAN SPRINKLING THE BODY UP AND DOWN WITH MUCH CARE
YOU DID IT MY BOY
TOTO HAD RUN ON AHEAD FRISKING PLAYFULLY WHEN SUDDENLY HE UTTERED A SHARP BARK OF FEAR AND CAME RUNNING BACK TO THEM WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS DOGS DO WHEN THEY ARE FRIGHTENED
SO IN ORDER NOT TO OFFEND HIM WE MUST NOT TREAD ON A SINGLE BLOSSOM ONCE SAID DOROTHY THE TIN WOODMAN STEPPED ON A BEETLE AND KILLED THE LITTLE CREATURE
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN A DARK WELL OR ANYTHING LIKE ONE DOES ANYONE LIVE ON THOSE MOUNTAINS BEYOND HERE ASKED THE SCARECROW
NOTICE WHAT VULGAR EXPRESSIONS SHE USES
I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO THINK OF THIS THING ANY MORE THAN WE CAN HELP HE REPLIED
I EVEN FORGOT ONE THING
THEN HE EXTENDED THEM AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD OUR TRAVELERS AND FOUND HE COULD ALMOST TOUCH THE SCARECROW--BUT NOT QUITE
IT'S MADE OF A RUBY
DO YOU WISH TO SEE DR PIPT ON BUSINESS OR FOR PLEASURE UNC SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE MAGICIAN UTTERED SUCH A WILD CRY THAT OJO JUMPED AWAY AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SPRANG AFTER HIM AND CLASPED HER STUFFED ARMS AROUND HIM IN TERROR
PATCHWORK GIRL HAS COME TO LIFE
WHY HERE'S WHERE THE PATH GOES TO SHE EXCLAIMED
DON'T MY COLORS RUN WHENEVER I RUN SHE ASKED
THREE NICE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL THE BOOK DECLARES ARE NEEDED FOR THE MAGIC SPELL AND WATER FROM A PITCH-DARK WELL
AS THE PATH GRADUALLY ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN ALTHOUGH IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY THEY DECIDED TO FOLLOW IT
SUPPOSE WE WAIT AND TALK WITH HIM ABOUT IT
LET'S SEE SHE REMARKED
THE CHIEF MERIT OF MY FRIEND IS THAT HE IS A GREAT THINKER AND IN OZ IT IS CONSIDERED GOOD POLICY TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY BRAINS IN HIS HEAD OBSERVED THE GLASS CAT
THAT'S ENOUGH BUT THE PHONOGRAPH CONTINUED PLAYING THE DREARY TUNE SO OJO SEIZED THE CRANK JERKED IT FREE AND THREW IT INTO THE ROAD
IT CONTAINS SOUP FISH ROAST MEAT SALAD APPLE-DUMPLINGS ICE CREAM AND CHOCOLATE-DROPS ALL BOILED DOWN TO THIS SMALL SIZE SO IT CAN BE CONVENIENTLY CARRIED AND SWALLOWED WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY AND NEED A SQUARE MEAL I'M SQUARE SAID THE WOOZY
HE WAS ONCE BUT HE HAS REFORMED AND NOW ASSISTS GLINDA THE GOOD WHO IS THE ROYAL SORCERESS OF OZ AND THE ONLY ONE LICENSED TO PRACTICE MAGIC OR SORCERY
THE SCARECROW HAD MADE A QUICK TRIP AND RETURNED TO THE EMERALD CITY WITH HIS LEFT EAR FRESHLY PAINTED
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT SUCH A JUMBLE COULD COME TO LIFE IT WAS THE MAGIC POWDER THAT DID IT EXPLAINED OJO
LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE PLEASE CRIED OJO EAGERLY
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY'D FLASH IMITATION FIRE INQUIRED THE WOOZY IN AN INJURED TONE
ALL THE SHELVES WERE LINED WITH BLUE GLASS BOTTLES NEATLY LABELED BY THE MAGICIAN TO SHOW WHAT THEY CONTAINED
I'LL WAIT IF DIKSEY ISN'T TOO LONG NO HE'S SHORT
DO YOU SURRENDER SHE ASKED THE MAN
YOU ARE NOT A HOPPER SAID HE FOR YOU HAVE TWO LEGS
COME IN THEN AND I'LL GIVE YOU A RECEIPT FOR HIM THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND PASSED THROUGH A HALL TO A LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE THE WOMAN PULLED THE ROBE OFF FROM OJO AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH KINDLY INTEREST
SO THE TOTTENHOT RAISED THE SCARECROW HIGH IN THE AIR AND TOSSED HIM OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD
ALL MY GOOD LUCK SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON THE THIRTEENTH
THEN OJO PULLED THE SCARECROW AWAY FROM THE PICKET AND PASSED HIM DOWN TO DOROTHY WHO IN TURN LOWERED HIM TO THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THE UNLUCKY ONES ARE THOSE WHO BEG FOR A CHANCE TO THINK LIKE POOR DR PIPT HERE
I DON'T WANT TO REPLIED THE PATCHWORK GIRL SPEAKING AS LOUDLY AS USUAL
OJO IS FORGIVEN 19
YOU OUGHT TO CARE FOR OZMA SAID HE IF YOU EXPECT TO SAVE YOUR UNCLE
COME ON THEN SAID THE BOY PICKING UP HIS BASKET
DR PIPT TOOK A SMALL BASKET FROM A CUPBOARD AND PACKED SEVERAL THINGS IN IT
AT FIRST HE STRUGGLED HARD TO ESCAPE CRYING OUT IN ANGER
BY AND BY OJO BEGAN TO WALK ON THE GREEN GRASS LOOKING CAREFULLY AROUND HIM
WHOEVER MADE THAT PATCHWORK QUILT FROM WHICH SCRAPS WAS FORMED MUST HAVE SELECTED THE GAYEST AND BRIGHTEST BITS OF CLOTH THAT EVER WERE WOVEN I AM GLAD YOU LIKE HER SAID THE SCARECROW IN A SATISFIED TONE
THE SHAGGY MAN LIMPED AS HE WALKED FOR HIS WOUND STILL HURT HIM AND SCRAPS WAS MUCH ANNOYED BECAUSE THE QUILLS HAD LEFT A NUMBER OF SMALL HOLES IN HER PATCHES
IT BUNCHES UP SOMETIMES IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO KEEP IT EVEN
PERMIT ME TO SAY BY THE WAY THAT YOU ARE THE QUEEREST LOT OF TRAVELERS THAT EVER CAME TO MY SHOP
I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO RUN BY THE GIANT'S CAVE AS FAST AS WE CAN GO
IT'S A PRETTY BIG RIVER AND THE CURRENT IS STRONG
AND THEN HE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS LATEST JOKE AND A CHORUS OF SMALL VOICES ECHOED THE CHORUS WITH TEE-HEE-HEE
WHOEVER LIVES HERE HAS BEEN KIND TO ME AND I'M MUCH OBLIGED THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO HE TOOK HIS BASKET AND WENT OUT THE DOOR THE CAT FOLLOWING HIM
WHEN I GROWL THE SOUND ECHOES LIKE THUNDER ALL THROUGH THE VALLEYS AND WOODLANDS AND CHILDREN TREMBLE WITH FEAR AND WOMEN COVER THEIR HEADS WITH THEIR APRONS AND BIG MEN RUN AND HIDE
BUT THE CAT EXCLAIMED
LOOSEN UP AND REEL OUT THE MUSIC VIC THE ONLY RECORD I HAVE WITH ME EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH IS ONE THE MAGICIAN ATTACHED JUST BEFORE WE HAD OUR QUARREL
THE WOLF IS AT THE DOOR THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT BUT A BONE WITHOUT MEAT AND A BILL FROM THE GROCERY STORE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ASKED OJO
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT OZMA WILL DO TO YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ONE OF US HAS BROKEN A LAW
YOU'LL FIND OUT IF YOU OBEY ME SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
YOU KNOW SHE THEN EXPLAINED THOSE NEIGHBORS OF YOURS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT POOR THINGS AND WHAT THEY THINK IS A JOKE ISN'T A JOKE AT ALL--IT'S TRUE DON'T YOU SEE TRUE THAT WE HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING ASKED THE CHAMPION
STOP WHAT'S WRONG NOW ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
CHAPTER TWELVE THE GIANT PORCUPINE NEXT MORNING THEY STARTED OUT BRIGHT AND EARLY TO FOLLOW THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
ISN'T HE JOLLY THE SCARECROW HAS MANY GOOD QUALITIES REPLIED DOROTHY
THEN HE WENT TO THE TABLE AND SAID
IF YOU WERE ALL COLORS AND MANY COLORS AS I AM YOU'D BE TOO STUCK UP FOR ANYTHING SHE LEAPED OVER THE CAT AND BACK AGAIN AND THE STARTLED BUNGLE CREPT CLOSE TO A TREE TO ESCAPE HER
THIS SQUARE BEAST IS CALLED THE WOOZY AND HE ISN'T OF MUCH IMPORTANCE EXCEPT THAT HE HAS THREE HAIRS GROWING ON THE TIP OF HIS TAIL THE SCARECROW LOOKED AND SAW THAT THIS WAS TRUE
SO IT IS RETURNED BUNGLE IN A GRUMPY TONE OF VOICE
DOROTHY'S PINK KITTEN FOR GOODNESS SAKE EXCLAIMED BUNGLE SITTING UP AND LOOKING INTERESTED
THOSE WHO TRAVEL ARE LIKELY TO MEET TROUBLE
BUT BE VERY CAREFUL OF YOURSELF FOR YOU'RE A SOUVENIR OF MY DEAR MARGOLOTTE
A SOFT SUBDUED HUM AS OF MANY VOICES REACHED THEIR EARS
BUT NOW THEY WERE NO LONGER IN THE DARK FOR A SOFT ROSY LIGHT ENABLED THEM TO SEE AROUND THEM QUITE DISTINCTLY
I ALSO THINK YOU DROPPED THE CLOVER INTO THIS VASE WHICH STOOD IN PRINCESS DOROTHY'S ROOM HOPING TO GET RID OF IT SO IT WOULD NOT PROVE THE BOY GUILTY
PUMPKINS ARE NOT PERMANENT MORE'S THE PITY AND IN TIME THEY SPOIL
AND NOW I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRISONER
THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL SHAPED BUT THEY ARE TWO IN NUMBER
QUICK MARGOLOTTE
OF COURSE HE REPLIED
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A VAST CAVE WHICH WAS DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE TINY GRAINS OF RADIUM THAT LAY SCATTERED AMONG THE LOOSE ROCKS
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT PERSONAGE THE SAWHORSE IS AND IF SOME ONE--PERHAPS YOURSELF--WILL TELL ME YOUR NAME YOUR RANK AND STATION AND YOUR HISTORY IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO RELATE THEM TO THE SAWHORSE
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR OJO FINDS THE DARK WELL THEY NOW FOLLOWED DIKSEY TO THE FARTHER END OF THE GREAT CAVE BEYOND THE HORNER CITY WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL ROUND DARK HOLES LEADING INTO THE GROUND IN A SLANTING DIRECTION
THAT IS NOT A DWARF BUT A BOY ANSWERED THE MAGICIAN
IT IS THE ONLY PRISON IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AM I A PRISONER BLESS THE CHILD
MY GOOD HOPPERS I WISH TO EXPLAIN THAT WHAT I SAID ABOUT YOU WAS A JOKE
SCRAPS BEGAN TO MUTTER SOMETHING ABOUT HOPPITY POPPITY JUMPITY DUMP BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
THAT MADE HIM VERY UNHAPPY AND HE CRIED UNTIL HIS TEARS RUSTED HIS JOINTS SO HE COULDN'T MOVE EM WHAT DID HE DO THEN ASKED OJO
IT FITS ME BETTER FOR MY PATCHWORK IS ALL SCRAPS AND NOTHING ELSE
UNDERSTAND NOT IN THE LEAST SAID SCRAPS
BUT ONE DAY HE MET DOROTHY IN THE FOREST AND WENT WITH HER TO THE EMERALD CITY WHERE HE MADE HIS FORTUNE
GO AHEAD AND PLAY SOMETHING IT'LL DRIVE YOU CRAZY WARNED THE CAT
DURING OUR JOURNEY WE CAME UPON A WOODEN SAWHORSE STANDING BY THE ROAD AND I USED THE MAGIC POWDER TO BRING IT TO LIFE
DON'T DO THAT EXCLAIMED THE SHAGGY MAN EARNESTLY
RIPPING THE SEAM OF THE PATCH ON THE GIRL'S FOREHEAD SHE PLACED THE POWDER WITHIN THE HEAD AND THEN SEWED UP THE SEAM AS NEATLY AND SECURELY AS BEFORE
BUT JACK PUMPKINHEAD GREW A LOT OF THINGS IN HIS GARDEN BESIDES PUMPKINS SO HE COOKED FOR THEM A FINE VEGETABLE SOUP AND GAVE DOROTHY OJO AND TOTO THE ONLY ONES WHO FOUND IT NECESSARY TO EAT A PUMPKIN PIE AND SOME GREEN CHEESE
BUT TAKE CARE OR I SHALL HAVE TO RESCUE YOU AGAIN OJO GAVE A JUMP FOR HE SAW SEVERAL BROAD LEAVES LEANING TOWARD HIM
IT MAKES A PERSON FEEL SAD OR SORRY OR DEVOTED OR SYMPATHETIC--ALL OF WHICH SENSATIONS INTERFERE WITH ONE'S HAPPINESS I HAVE A HEART MURMURED THE GLASS CAT
HOW FAR IS IT TO THE HORNER COUNTRY HE ASKED
YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR EYES BUT WE CAN AND I NOTICE YOU'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT LITTLE COLOR YOU HAVE
THE TROUBLESOME PHONOGRAPH 8
CHAPTER SIX THE JOURNEY OJO HAD NEVER TRAVELED BEFORE AND SO HE ONLY KNEW THAT THE PATH DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE LED INTO THE OPEN MUNCHKIN COUNTRY WHERE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DWELT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH SAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL PLAYING WITH PEBBLES SHE HAD PICKED UP
THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL TIRED FROM THE LONG WALK AND HE HAD A GREAT MANY THINGS TO THINK OF AND CONSIDER BESIDES THE EVENTS OF THE JOURNEY
I THINK THE LIGHT IS TRAVELING TOO AND WE SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH IT
THE MINE'S MINE AND I KNOW EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
I GUESS THE WOOZY IS ASLEEP SAID SCRAPS
I MAY SAY IT IS EVEN MORE STYLISH NOT TO SAY ARISTOCRATIC THAN STRAW SAID THE SCARECROW POLITELY
IT HAS BEEN DAYLIGHT A LONG TIME WHAT DID YOU DO ALL NIGHT ASKED THE BOY
IN A LITTLE WHILE DIKSEY CAME BACK WITH A TALL LADDER WHICH HE PLACED AGAINST THE FENCE
YOU ARE QUITE HANDSOME SHE SAID
I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVEN'T A CLEAR RECORD ANSWERED THE MACHINE
YO-HO HE SAID IN A DEEP BASS VOICE
HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THIS ONE LEG WHICH LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE A PEDESTAL AND WHEN TOTO RAN UP AND MADE A GRAB AT THE MAN'S ANKLE HE HOPPED FIRST ONE WAY AND THEN ANOTHER IN A VERY ACTIVE MANNER LOOKING SO FRIGHTENED THAT SCRAPS LAUGHED ALOUD
BUT I AM GUILTY OF THIS ACT AND WHATEVER PUNISHMENT YOU THINK I DESERVE I WILL SUFFER WILLINGLY OZMA SMILED MORE BRIGHTLY THEN AND NODDED GRACIOUSLY
AND NOW THAT NOTHING GROWS IN OUR BACK YARD THAT IS GOOD TO EAT WE MUST GO WHERE THERE IS FOOD UNC NUNKIE MADE NO REPLY FOR A TIME
WHAT ELSE UNC BREAD I'M EATING THE LAST LOAF THAT'S RIPE
OJO WIPED HIS EYES FOR HE COULD NOT HOLD BACK THE TEARS
NEXT MOMENT THE TIN MAN HAD CLASPED THE SCARECROW IN A WARM EMBRACE AND THEN TURNED TO HUG DOROTHY
BUT NO PERSON COULD HE SEE
AH LOVES MAH LULU MAH COAL-BLACK LULU THERE AIN'T NOBODY ELSE LOVES LOO-LOO LU HERE--SHUT THAT OFF CRIED THE SHAGGY MAN SPRINGING TO HIS FEET
INSTEAD IT SLIPPED OUT OF OJO'S HANDS AND HE AND SCRAPS BOTH ROLLED UPON THE GROUND IN A HEAP AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY BUMPED AGAINST THE ROCKY CAVE
IT LOOKS AS IF NO ONE HAD PASSED THROUGH IN MANY YEARS LOOKS ARE DECEIVING DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHING AT THEIR DISAPPOINTED FACES AND THIS BARRIER IS THE MOST DECEIVING THING IN ALL OZ IT PREVENTS OUR GOING ANY FARTHER ANYHOW SAID SCRAPS
BUT YOU ARE NOT TO ORDER HER AROUND BUNGLE AS YOU DO US
WHY IT'S A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT REPLIED THE SCARECROW WELL PLEASED
KEEP THAT UNTIL I GET OUT OF PRISON
AND PERHAPS YOU ARE--FROM A SCARECROW POINT OF VIEW REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN
IN THE TOP OF ITS HEAD HOWEVER WAS A MASS OF DELICATE PINK BALLS WHICH LOOKED LIKE JEWELS AND IT HAD A HEART MADE OF A BLOOD-RED RUBY
I CUT DOWN THE LEAF WITH MY KNIFE AND--OUT YOU POPPED
THE HEAD ITSELF WAS MERELY A BAG OF CLOTH FASTENED TO THE BODY AT THE NECK AND ON THE FRONT OF THIS BAG WAS PAINTED THE FACE--EARS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH
I'LL SAVE THE DOG FOR DESSERT TOTO GROWLED KEEPING A GOOD DISTANCE AWAY
I THINK SAID THE SCARECROW THAT IF I COULD TALK WITH THOSE HORNERS THEY WOULD APOLOGIZE TO YOU AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO FIGHT CAN'T YOU TALK FROM THIS SIDE ASKED THE CHAMPION
ALSO WHEN I AM ANGRY MY EYES FLASH FIRE WHETHER I GROWL OR NOT REAL FIRE ASKED OJO
THEN ADDRESSING HER REFLECTION IN THE GLASS SHE EXCLAIMED
I HOPE YOU WILL TASTE BETTER FOR YOU SEEM PLUMP AND TENDER OH I'M NOT GOING TO BE EATEN SAID DOROTHY
OZMA'S ONLY A GIRL THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
I'LL TRY TO FIND IT THE MAGICIAN LOOKED AT THE LITTLE MUNCHKIN BOY IN A DOUBTFUL WAY AND SAID
YOU'D GIVE YOUR WHISKERS FOR A LOVELY VARIEGATED COMPLEXION LIKE MINE I WOULDN'T RETORTED THE CAT
SHE FOUND THE BREAD AND CHEESE WHICH SHE HAD NO USE FOR AND THE BUNDLE OF CHARMS WHICH WERE CURIOUS BUT QUITE A MYSTERY TO HER
THE MAN'S EYES WERE BIG AND STARING AS HE EXAMINED THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL AND THE CHILDREN SHYLY HID BEHIND HIM AND PEEKED TIMIDLY AT TOTO
THE JOURNEY 7
BUT THERE ISN'T SUCH A THING THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT REPLIED OJO
THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND MADE HER A LOW BOW SAYING
SO OJO WENT UP TO THE QUEER CREATURE AND TAKING HOLD OF ONE OF THE HAIRS BEGAN TO PULL
THEY MIGHT WANT ME TO WRITE A BOOK
THE SCARECROW WORE THE BLUE DRESS OF THE MUNCHKINS IN WHICH COUNTRY HE WAS MADE AND ON HIS HEAD WAS SET A PEAKED HAT WITH A FLAT BRIM TRIMMED WITH TINKLING BELLS
I'VE THE CLEAREST COMPLEXION IN THE WORLD AND I DON'T EMPLOY A BEAUTY-DOCTOR EITHER I SEE YOU DON'T SAID SCRAPS
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK
THE SHAGGY MAN DROPPED FLAT ON HIS FACE TO AVOID THE SHOWER BUT ONE QUILL STRUCK HIM IN THE LEG AND WENT FAR IN
THE SIGN DOESN'T SAY
CHAPTER TEN SHAGGY MAN TO THE RESCUE THEY HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE BUNGLE WHO HAD RUN ON AHEAD CAME BOUNDING BACK TO SAY THAT THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS WAS JUST BEFORE THEM
BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE STRANGERS AND DON'T KNOW YOU ARE HERE WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF YOUR WAY TELL YOU WHAT SAID SCRAPS WHO WAS TRYING TO PULL THE QUILLS OUT OF HER OWN BODY LET'S GATHER UP ALL THE QUILLS AND TAKE THEM AWAY WITH US
IT'S TRUE BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SUCH A POOR JOKE
YOU'LL COME TO THE YELLOW BRICKS PRETTY SOON AND YOU'LL KNOW THEM WHEN YOU SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY YELLOW THINGS IN THE BLUE COUNTRY THANK YOU SAID THE BOY
AT FIRST I COULDN'T THINK WHAT TO MAKE HER OF BUT FINALLY IN SEARCHING THROUGH A CHEST I CAME ACROSS AN OLD PATCHWORK QUILT WHICH MY GRANDMOTHER ONCE MADE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG WHAT IS A PATCHWORK QUILT ASKED OJO
IT ISN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO BLAME ME
YOU ARE STILL VERY GORGEOUS IN SPITE OF YOUR LONG JOURNEY THE CHILDREN OF THE HOUSE WANTED TO KEEP THE GLASS CAT TO PLAY WITH SO BUNGLE WAS OFFERED A GOOD HOME IF SHE WOULD REMAIN
ADVISE YOU TO PURR SOFT AND LOOK HUMBLE--IF YOU CAN
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE HIP HOPPER THE CHAMPION THEY MUST HAVE HAD GOOD COURAGE TO CLIMB ALL THOSE ROCKS FOR AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE CANYON THEY ENCOUNTERED MORE ROCK HILLS TO BE SURMOUNTED
CLAMBERING HERE AND THERE AMONG THE BOULDERS THEY KEPT STEADILY ON GRADUALLY RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL FINALLY THEY CAME TO A GREAT RIFT IN A PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE ROCK SEEMED TO HAVE SPLIT IN TWO AND LEFT HIGH WALLS ON EITHER SIDE
IS THERE MUCH OF A HOLE IN MY BACK THE LITTLE GIRL EXAMINED HIM CAREFULLY
THE WELL IS AT YOUR FEET ALL RIGHT REPLIED OJO AND KNEELING DOWN HE FELT IN THE WELL WITH HIS HAND AND FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED A QUANTITY OF WATER
DON'T YOU EVER CROSS IT ASKED THE GIRL
WE MUST ALL GO BACK TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK OZMA'S ADVICE
OZMA HAD NEVER KNOWN THAT HER DOMINIONS CONTAINED SUCH A THING AS A WOOZY THERE BEING BUT ONE IN EXISTENCE AND THIS BEING CONFINED IN HIS FOREST FOR MANY YEARS
YOU WOULD GET US ALL INTO TROUBLE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE THAN IS NECESSARY
JUST AT THE POINT WHERE THE PATH LEFT THE FOREST STOOD A TINY HOUSE COVERED WITH LEAVES FROM THE TREES AND BEFORE THIS STOOD A MUNCHKIN MAN WITH AN AXE IN HIS HAND
BUT ANYHOW YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY I'M DREADFUL
THAT'S THE OTHER EXTREME
EVERYONE IN OZ LOVES OZMA AND HATES HER ENEMIES FOR SHE IS AS JUST AS SHE IS POWERFUL OJO SULKED A WHILE BUT FINALLY RETURNED TO THE ROAD AND KEPT AWAY FROM THE GREEN CLOVER
THE FURNITURE WAS FRAMED IN GOLD AND UPHOLSTERED IN SATIN BROCADE AND IT CONSISTED OF EASY CHAIRS DIVANS AND STOOLS IN GREAT VARIETY
THE MUSIC MY SERVANT WILL USUALLY HEAR REMARKED MARGOLOTTE WILL BE MY ORDERS TO DO HER WORK
IS THAT SO
WHY THERE'S NO ONE HERE THERE MUST BE SAID THE BOY
SCRAPS WAS QUICK-WITTED AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NO HEART SHE RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT OJO WAS HER FIRST FRIEND
THAT WALL EXPLAINED THE SHAGGY MAN IS WHAT IS CALLED AN OPTICAL ILLUSION
NOT SAID THE OLD MUNCHKIN
WHAT'S THE MATTER
HE SAID WE WERE LACKING IN UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE HAD ONLY ONE LEG TO A PERSON
THE RIGHT-HANDED PEOPLE ARE USUALLY ONE-HANDED AND I'VE A WART UNDER MY RIGHT ARM SAID OJO
THE WOMAN PROVED TO BE CROSS AND BAD-TEMPERED PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE RED EEL DURING ALL THE DAY
AS SOON AS HE WAS ON HIS FEET AND STANDING ON SOLID GROUND THE SCARECROW SAID
ANOTHER THING THEY AVOIDED WAS CONVERSING ON UNPLEASANT SUBJECTS AND FOR THAT REASON OJO AND HIS TROUBLES WERE NOT MENTIONED DURING THE DINNER
SO FINDING THEY COULD NOT DESTROY ME THEY DROVE ME INTO THIS FOREST AND BUILT A FENCE AROUND ME
HE IS NO LONGER EVEN CROOKED BUT A MAN LIKE OTHER MEN AS HE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS THE WIZARD WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD DR PIPT AND INSTANTLY EVERY CROOKED LIMB STRAIGHTENED OUT AND BECAME PERFECT
WELL SAID SCRAPS I GUESS WE'LL STOP HERE IT'S A GOOD GUESS REPLIED OJO
SO I PROPOSE WE ALLOW DR PIPT TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WILL SAVE THEM AND THAT WE ASSIST OJO TO FIND THE THINGS HE IS SEEKING
JUST TOSS ME OVER AND I'LL BE SATISFIED SO THE CHAMPION PICKED UP THE SCARECROW AND BALANCED HIM A MOMENT TO SEE HOW MUCH HE WEIGHED AND THEN WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH TOSSED HIM HIGH INTO THE AIR
THE MUNCHKIN FARMER WHO HAD MADE THE SCARECROW HAD NEGLECTED TO SEW HIM TOGETHER WITH CLOSE STITCHES AND THEREFORE SOME OF THE STRAW WITH WHICH HE WAS STUFFED WAS INCLINED TO STICK OUT BETWEEN THE SEAMS
THE GATES HAD BARS OF PURE GOLD AND ON EITHER SIDE OF EACH GATEWAY WERE BUILT HIGH TOWERS FROM WHICH FLOATED GAY BANNERS
DO NOT BLAME ME MISS GORGEOUS IF I REGARD YOU WITH SUSPICION
WHEN THEY FIND I'M GONE THE FARMERS WILL BE BADLY SCARED FOR THEY'LL EXPECT ME TO EAT UP THEIR HONEY-BEES AS I DID BEFORE THAT REMINDS ME SAID THE BOY THAT YOU MUST PROMISE NOT TO EAT HONEY-BEES WHILE YOU ARE IN OUR COMPANY NONE AT ALL NOT A BEE
AND THEN THERE'S PRINCESS DOROTHY AS SWEET AS ANY ROSE A LASS FROM KANSAS WHERE THEY DON'T GROW FAIRIES I SUPPOSE
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER INQUIRINGLY BUT NO ONE COULD ANSWER SUCH A PUZZLING QUESTION
THE CHUBBY MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
INVENTION OF THE GREAT PROFESSOR WOGGLE-BUG OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF ATHLETICS
WHY THAT'S ALL I HAVE--ON MY TAIL OR ANYWHERE ELSE EXCLAIMED THE BEAST
IT'S JUST NONSENSE DECLARED THE GLASS CAT
WHO IS THERE CRIED A VOICE FROM WITHIN
SINGING OR WHISTLING--IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH--MAKES EM BEHAVE AND NOTHING ELSE WILL
THIS IS A FLAT COUNTRY SO YOU WON'T FIND ANY DARK WELLS HERE SAID HE
HA HA HA
HA HA HA
YOU'RE GETTING CRAZY AGAIN
HE ALSO GAVE A PORTION TO THE WOOZY
SHE'S ALWAYS KEPT HER MAGIC SCEPTRE TO ENFORCE DECREES TO MAKE HER PEOPLE HAPPY FOR HER HEART IS KIND AND TRUE AND TO AID THE NEEDY AND DISTRESSED IS WHAT SHE LONGS TO DO
THE TWO SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT A LONG TIME--THE OLD WHITE-BEARDED MUNCHKIN AND THE LITTLE BOY
HAD OJO TOLD ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HE SOUGHT WAS THE WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY I WOULD HAVE INFORMED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED OUT THAT HE COULD NEVER SECURE IT
IT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT HAD TWO HOLES JUST IN FRONT OF HIS EYES SO HE COULD SEE WHERE TO GO
OF COURSE SAID THE LITTLE GIRL WHEN THEY HAD WALKED A WAY ALONG THE PASSAGE IT WAS LUCKY FOR US THE GIANT WAS CAGED
ONE THAT THE FEEBLE-MINDED CAN REMEMBER THE WORDS OF AND THOSE IGNORANT OF MUSIC CAN WHISTLE OR SING
WHAT DO YOU THINK WIZARD THAT IS PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO DO REPLIED THE WIZARD
I'VE FACED THE DREADFUL HAMMERHEADS WHICH HAVE NO ARMS AND BUTT YOU LIKE A GOAT
HAVE YOU ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS ASKED THE SCARECROW
AND I WILL GO WITH YOU DECLARED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THERE IS NO ORANGE MARMALADE AROUND HERE AH BUT I EAT OTHER THINGS ASSERTED MISTER YOOP
BUT IF HE DOESN'T GET EM UNC WILL ALWAYS STAND A MARBLE CHUNK THE MAGICIAN LOOKED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY
BUT TO ME THE TREES ARE GLOOMY AND SAD AND THE WILD-FLOWERS SEEM LONESOME
THEN SHE SMILED AGAIN AND CONTINUED IN A LIGHTER TONE
UNC NUNKIE TOOK THIS RIGHT-HAND PATH AND OJO FOLLOWED WITHOUT ASKING WHY
SO HERE I AM OBLIGED TO STAY AND I CONFESS IT IS A VERY PLEASANT COUNTRY TO LIVE IN HOOT-TI-TOOT CRIED THE OWL
THERE WAS A PRETTY GARDEN AROUND THE HOUSE WHERE BLUE TREES AND BLUE FLOWERS GREW IN ABUNDANCE AND IN ONE PLACE WERE BEDS OF BLUE CABBAGES BLUE CARROTS AND BLUE LETTUCE ALL OF WHICH WERE DELICIOUS TO EAT
I CAN'T SEE THAT LEGS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH UNDERSTANDING THINGS
THE PATCHWORK GIRL LOOKED AT THE CLOVER AND SAID
A TINY GREEN PLANT GROWING NEGLECTED AND TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT
DURING THE CONVERSATION THE SCARECROW EXPLAINED THEIR QUEST FOR A DARK WELL AND ASKED JACK'S ADVICE WHERE TO FIND IT
WHEN I WAS SHUT UP IN THAT FOREST I LONGED FOR SOME ONE TO HELP ME AND BY AND BY OJO CAME AND DID HELP ME
NEITHER DID HE GO DIRECTLY TO BED
AT ONCE A CAT ENTERED CAME TO THE CENTER OF THE ROOM AND STOPPED SHORT AT THE SIGHT OF STRANGERS
I'M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE SAWHORSE AFTER ALL I'M A BETTER BEAST THAN HE IS RETORTED THE WOOZY INDIGNANTLY
THEN IT'S DANGEROUS WILD WITH JOY I MEAN EXPLAINED THE PHONOGRAPH
THIS AMUSED HIM UNTIL THE WOMAN CAME IN WITH A LARGE TRAY AND SPREAD A CLOTH ON ONE OF THE TABLES
WELL DOC PIPT DO YOU MEAN TO INTRODUCE US OR NOT DEMANDED THE CAT IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE
HAD HE BEEN FACE DOWNWARD THE SCARECROW MIGHT HAVE MANAGED TO FREE HIMSELF BUT LYING ON HIS BACK ON THE PICKET HIS HANDS WAVED IN THE AIR OF THE HORNER COUNTRY WHILE HIS FEET KICKED THE AIR OF THE HOPPER COUNTRY
LUCKY I PASSED BY WASN'T IT YOU WERE VERY KIND SAID OJO AND I THANK YOU
THE SHAGGY MAN HAD WANDERED IN MANY PARTS OF OZ AND SO HAD DOROTHY FOR THAT MATTER YET NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHERE A DARK WELL WAS TO BE FOUND
BUT I WANT TO HELP OJO WHO IS MY FRIEND TO RESCUE THE UNCLE WHOM HE LOVES AND I'D KILL A DOZEN USELESS BUTTERFLIES TO ENABLE HIM TO DO THAT THE TIN WOODMAN SIGHED REGRETFULLY
THIS PART OF THE QUADLING COUNTRY SEEMED PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS IF RATHER LONELY AND THE ROAD WAS MORE DISTINCT AND EASIER TO FOLLOW
SUDDENLY THE WHOLE LEAF TOPPLED AND FELL CARRYING THE BOY WITH IT AND WHILE HE SPRAWLED AT FULL LENGTH THE FOLDS SLOWLY RELAXED AND SET HIM FREE
THEY HAD NO OARS NOR EVEN A POLE TO GUIDE THE RAFT WITH
THE INHABITANTS OF THE EMERALD CITY WERE POLITE PEOPLE AND NEVER JEERED AT THE UNFORTUNATE
COTTON STUFFING SUSPENDER-BUTTON EYES RED VELVET TONGUE PEARL BEADS FOR TEETH
DEAR ME HOW CARELESS MY VALET MUST HAVE BEEN IN OILING ME THIS MORNING
THAT DID THE BUSINESS ALL RIGHT
DOROTHY LISTENED TO ALL THIS WITH MUCH INTEREST AND THOUGHT THAT SO FAR OJO HAD ACTED VERY WELL
BUT THE MAGICIAN WILL GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS
AND IN ANY EVENT IT IS WRONG TO DISOBEY A LAW OJO KNEW SHE WAS RIGHT AND FELT GREATLY MORTIFIED TO REALIZE HE HAD ACTED AND SPOKEN SO RIDICULOUSLY
THE MORE ONE KNOWS THE LUCKIER HE IS FOR KNOWLEDGE IS THE GREATEST GIFT IN LIFE BUT TELL ME PLEASE WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO WITH THIS NEW LOT OF THE POWDER OF LIFE WHICH DR PIPT IS MAKING
A FEW MINUTES LATER HE CALLED TO THEM TO TURN ABOUT QUICKLY AND STEP FORWARD AND AS THEY OBEYED THE ORDER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TREADING SOLID GROUND
WHEN WE COME TO SOME HOUSE WE WILL INQUIRE THE WAY TO THE EMERALD CITY CHAPTER EIGHT THE FOOLISH OWL AND THE WISE DONKEY ON THEY WENT AND HALF AN HOUR'S STEADY WALKING BROUGHT THEM TO A HOUSE SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN THE TWO THEY HAD ALREADY PASSED
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JOURNEY AND QUARRELING MAKES ME DISCOURAGED
I'M SURE THE TIN WOODMAN WILL DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO HELP YOU TO SAVE YOUR UNC NUNKIE AND POOR MARGOLOTTE THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND SAID THE MUNCHKIN BOY IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL INDEED
WHAT A SWEET DISPOSITION THAT CREATURE HAS
HE THINKS THERE'S NO HARM IN DOING MAGIC THINGS FOR HIS OWN FAMILY AND HE MADE ME OUT OF GLASS BECAUSE THE MEAT CATS DRINK TOO MUCH MILK
BUT I WANT THEM VERY MUCH THEY ARE MY SOLE ORNAMENTS MY PRETTIEST FEATURE SAID THE WOOZY UNEASILY
I CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT OJO WHO LOVES HIS UNCLE WILL BE UNHAPPY UNLESS HE CAN SAVE HIM
THE WORLD DOESN'T CONSIST WHOLLY OF THE TREES THAT ARE ON ALL SIDES OF US BUT THEY'RE PART OF IT
BUT THE MAGICIAN REPLIED
COME AND LED HIM TO A BED
THERE IS PLENTY FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW
COME OJO WAS WELL PLEASED
SHE MAKES A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION BUT ADMIRES HERSELF A LITTLE MORE THAN IS CONSIDERED MODEST AND SHE POSITIVELY REFUSES TO CATCH MICE EXPLAINED MARGOLOTTE
HOLD ON SHOUTED THE PHONOGRAPH
JACK AND JILL WENT UP THE HILL TO FETCH NO NO
YOU CAN SEE EM WORK WELL GO ALONG SAID THE MAGICIAN IRRITABLY
IT'S THE SAME WITH ME TOLLYDIGGLE LAUGHED THE SOLDIER
I AM GLAD YOU REMINDED ME OF THEM FOR IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SUPPLY THEM BY ANY MEANS
IN THE BANQUET HALL TO-NIGHT WERE GATHERED ONLY OLD AND TRUSTED FRIENDS SO HERE OZMA WAS HERSELF--A MERE GIRL
THERE WAS A ROW OF WINDOWS EXTENDING NEARLY AROUND THE SIDES OF THE CIRCULAR ROOM WHICH RENDERED THE PLACE VERY LIGHT AND THERE WAS A BACK DOOR IN ADDITION TO THE ONE LEADING TO THE FRONT PART OF THE HOUSE
MAY WE COME OUT AGAIN
THAT I CANNOT TELL
TOTO CAN SWIM A LITTLE BUT THAT WON'T HELP US TO GET TO SHORE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I COULD SWIM OR NOT REMARKED SCRAPS
TO HER SURPRISE IT SLOWLY SWUNG BACKWARD AND SHOWED BEHIND IT A DARK HOLE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE MOUTH OF A TUNNEL
IT'S THE MEANEST TRICK I EVER HEARD OF MUTTERED THE PORCUPINE GLOOMILY
HA HA
RUN
DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE ROAD LAY A MOTIONLESS OBJECT THAT BRISTLED ALL OVER WITH SHARP QUILLS WHICH RESEMBLED ARROWS
THE PLACE WAS IN A CLEARING ON THE MOUNTAIN BUT A LITTLE WAY OFF WAS THE GRIM FOREST WHICH COMPLETELY SURROUNDED IT
THIS IS QUEER MUSED DOROTHY LOOKING AT THE WATER REFLECTIVELY
IF ANY OF US TAKES A REST WE'LL BE ARRESTED SURE AND GET NO RESTITUTION CAUSE THE REST WE MUST ENDURE I SEE SAID THE WOODCHOPPER NODDING
NEARER AND NEARER CAME THE SOUNDS AND THEN THEY SEEMED TO BE JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEAF THAT WAS HUGGING HIM
MISTER YOOP WAS QUITE ASTONISHED TO SEE THEM COME FLYING TOWARD HIM AND THRUSTING HIS ARMS BETWEEN THE BARS HE SEIZED THE SCARECROW IN A FIRM GRIP
STILL IT IS BUT PROPER THAT ONE SO ENTRANCINGLY LOVELY SHOULD HAVE THE BEST STUFFING THERE IS GOING
WE NEVER HAVE USED MY GRANDMOTHER'S MANY-COLORED PATCHWORK QUILT HANDSOME AS IT IS FOR WE MUNCHKINS DO NOT CARE FOR ANY COLOR OTHER THAN BLUE SO IT HAS BEEN PACKED AWAY IN THE CHEST FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS
JACK HAD MADE IT HIMSELF AND WAS VERY PROUD OF IT
I CAN SCARCELY SEE THE PATH HE SAID AT LAST
IT IS CERTAIN THAT JACK PUMPKINHEAD MIGHT HAVE HAD A MUCH FINER HOUSE TO LIVE IN HAD HE WANTED IT FOR OZMA LOVED THE STUPID FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HER EARLIEST COMPANION
NEVER MIND SAID SCRAPS
THERE'S TIK-TOK--HE'S A CLOCKWORK MAN AND QUITE A FUNNY SIGHT HE TALKS AND WALKS MECHANICALLY WHEN HE'S WOUND UP TIGHT
HE CLAIMS TO POSSESS THE BEST BRAINS IN ALL OZ BETTER THAN MINE ASKED SCRAPS
WHEN YOU ARE TRIED AND FOUND GUILTY YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO MAKE AMENDS IN SOME WAY
BY AND BY THEY BEGAN TO CROSS AN IMMENSE FIELD OF SPLENDID YELLOW LILIES THE DELICATE FRAGRANCE OF WHICH WAS VERY DELIGHTFUL
BUT SHE KNEW WHAT THE FIGURE WAS AND TO TEST HER POWDER OF LIFE SHE SPRINKLED SOME OF IT ON THE MAN I HAD MADE
AND AREN'T THEY PRETTY TREES RETURNED SCRAPS BOBBING HER HEAD UNTIL HER BROWN YARN CURLS FLUTTERED IN THE BREEZE
WHAT FOR I HAVEN'T LOOKED TO SEE ANSWERED THE SOLDIER
OJO KEPT CLOSE TO THE SCARECROW AND THE SCARECROW KEPT CLOSE TO DOROTHY
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SCRAPS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CRIED THE BOY JOYFULLY
BUT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO ESCAPE
THE SIGN SAYS THAT YOU ARE WISE REMARKED SCRAPS TO THE DONKEY
THE LITTLE BROWN FOLKS WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT BEING ATTACKED BY THE GIRL AND THE DOG AND ONE OR TWO WHO HAD BEEN SLAPPED HARDEST BEGAN TO CRY
ALL THE PEOPLE OF OZ RESPECT THE SAWHORSE HIGHLY AND WHEN I VISIT OZMA SHE SOMETIMES ALLOWS ME TO RIDE HIM--AS I AM DOING TO-DAY
MASSES OF GREAT BROAD LEAVES WHICH ROSE FROM THE GROUND FAR INTO THE AIR UNTIL THEY TOWERED TWICE AS HIGH AS THE TOP OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD WHO WAS A LITTLE TALLER THAN OJO
SOME OF THE PUMPKINS NOW RIPENING ON THE VINES WERE ALMOST AS LARGE AS JACK'S HOUSE AND HE TOLD DOROTHY HE INTENDED TO ADD ANOTHER PUMPKIN TO HIS MANSION
IN OTHER WORDS HER BRAINS MUSTN'T BE VERY GOOD WRONG SAID UNC NUNKIE
EXCEPT ME SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL JUMPING UP TO WHIRL MERRILY AROUND THE ROOM
THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED
WELL YOU ENDED IT SO WE WON'T ARGUE THE MATTER
AND NOW I'M GOING TO BED BUNGLE CONSIDERED THE SHAGGY MAN'S ADVICE SO CAREFULLY THAT HER PINK BRAINS WERE BUSY LONG AFTER THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY WERE FAST ASLEEP
THEN LAST OF ALL WAS THE GLASS CAT HOLDING FAST TO THE WOOZY'S TAIL WITH HER GLASS JAWS
I CONGRATULATE YOU
IF THEY ARE REALLY TRUE FRIENDS THEY MAY BE ANYTHING THEY LIKE FOR ALL OF ME THERE'S SOME SENSE IN THAT SAID SCRAPS NODDING HER QUEER HEAD IN APPROVAL
DOROTHY TOO LOOKED GRAVE AND DISCONCERTED BUT SHE KNEW IN HER HEART THAT THE TIN WOODMAN WAS RIGHT
SCRAPS THOUGHT IT WAS ODD THAT THEY COULD BE SO EASILY AMUSED BUT DECIDED THERE COULD BE LITTLE HARM IN PEOPLE WHO LAUGHED SO MERRILY
LOOKING THROUGH THE PAGES HE FOUND THE RECIPE HE WANTED AND SAID
WE DON'T WANT TO BURN THE WHOLE FENCE DOWN SAID HE FOR THE FLAMES WOULD ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO WOULD THEN COME AND CAPTURE THE WOOZY AGAIN
TO BE BRAVE ONE MUST BE CHEERFUL SO I HOPE YOU WILL BE AS GOOD-TEMPERED AS POSSIBLE THEY HAD TRAVELED SOME DISTANCE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY FACED A HIGH FENCE WHICH BARRED ANY FURTHER PROGRESS STRAIGHT AHEAD
NOTHING EXCEPT SIX ANTS AND A MONKEY
SEARCH HIM IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T FIND THE CLOVER
I KNOW
I KNOW
I KNOW
I KNOW
OZMA IS WRONG--YOU ARE ALL WRONG--FOR OJO HAS BROKEN NO LAW THEN HE WILL SOON BE FREE AGAIN REPLIED THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
THAT POWDER OF LIFE WHICH IS MADE BY THE CROOKED MAGICIAN IS REALLY A WONDERFUL THING
BUT THE MOST CURIOUS THING ABOUT THE SWAYING LEAVES WAS THEIR COLOR
THEY EXPECTED TO REACH SOME OTHER HOUSE BEFORE IT GREW DARK BUT THE TWILIGHT WAS BRIEF AND OJO SOON BEGAN TO FEAR THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN LEAVING THE WOODCHOPPER
AND MINE SAID SCRAPS
OJO WHO WAS ON THE FRONT OF THE RAFT LOOKED OVER INTO THE WATER AND THOUGHT HE SAW SOME LARGE FISHES SWIMMING ABOUT
I KNOW THAT LOTS OF THE CITY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE LAND
BUT HE TOLD SCRAPS AND ME THAT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS LIVE ON THIS MOUNTAIN HE SAID IN THE MOUNTAIN DECLARED SCRAPS
HE IS NO LONGER A CROOKED MAGICIAN BUT A SIMPLE MUNCHKIN
BUT FOR MY PART I AM CURIOUS TO LOOK AT SUCH A GREAT MAN THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
WE DO NOT LIKE THE DAY BUT IN THE NIGHT TIS OUR DELIGHT TO GAMBOL SKIP AND PLAY
THEN CAME OJO WITH SCRAPS THE LAST OF THE FOUR
HIGGLEDY PIGGLEDY DEE WHAT FOOLS MAGICIANS BE
SHE HAS PINK BRAINS
I LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING PROPER FOR IT SAVES ONE A LOT OF TROUBLE IT DOES INDEED SAID DOROTHY
THE TAIL WAS FORMED BY A SMALL BRANCH THAT HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE LOG WHILE THE HEAD WAS A GNARLED BUMP ON ONE END OF THE BODY
THERE WERE SEVERAL WICKED WITCHES WHO CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE
YOU'LL LIKE HIM I'M SURE JUST THEN THE FAMOUS SCARECROW OF OZ CAME AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD RIDING ASTRIDE A WOODEN SAWHORSE WHICH WAS SO SMALL THAT ITS RIDER'S LEGS NEARLY TOUCHED THE GROUND
I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE MY GIRL A LITTLE CLEVERNESS WHICH IS THE DOCTOR'S SUBSTITUTE FOR INTELLIGENCE'--A QUALITY HE HAS NOT YET LEARNED HOW TO MANUFACTURE TAKING DOWN THE BOTTLE OF CLEVERNESS SHE ADDED SOME OF THE POWDER TO THE HEAP ON THE DISH
CAN'T I SING ASKED SCRAPS
COURSE NOT SAID DOROTHY
AS FOR THE GLASS CAT--PROPERLY NAMED BUNGLE--IF SHE BOTHERS YOU I NOW GIVE YOU MY PERMISSION TO BREAK HER IN TWO FOR SHE IS NOT RESPECTFUL AND DOES NOT OBEY ME
IN THE QUADLING COUNTRY WHICH LIES SOUTH OF HERE REPLIED THE SCARECROW
I WANT SOMETHING I CAN CHEW AND TASTE GRUMBLED THE WOOZY
TWILIGHT HAD FALLEN BY THE TIME THEY CAME TO THE TREES BENEATH WHICH WERE THE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECTS THEY HAD MARKED FROM A DISTANCE
I HAVE A MOST TERRIBLE GROWL--THAT IS SOMETIMES SAID THE WOOZY AS SCRAPS LAUGHED MERRILY AND THE SHAGGY MAN SMILED
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE ASKED
TOLLYDIGGLE SEEMED SURPRISED BY THE QUESTION BUT SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
AT LAST SAID HE RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER GLEEFULLY I HAVE AMPLE LEISURE FOR A GOOD TALK WITH MY OLD FRIEND UNC NUNKIE
DEAR ME SAID DOROTHY
SOME ONE SPOKE TO ME I CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM REPLIED THE CAT AND NO ONE IS PRESENT BUT OURSELVES
SO HE TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND HAT AND CREPT INTO THE BED
WHENEVER THEY MET ANY OF THE HAPPY SMILING PEOPLE THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY IN SHAME ALTHOUGH NONE KNEW WHO WAS BENEATH THE ROBE
BUT I SPRINKLED A FEW DROPS OF THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION ON IT AND NOW IT IS MARBLE
HOW HEARTLESS WAILED THE GIANT SHAKING THE BARS AGAIN
ONE FAMILY LIVES THERE I'VE HEARD
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THEY BRIBE THE LAZY QUADLING NOW SAID DOROTHY AS THEY STOOD ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH HAVING LEFT BEHIND THEM THE CAVE IN WHICH DWELT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS I THINK WE MUST FIND A ROAD INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES FOR THERE IS WHERE OJO WANTS TO GO NEXT IS THERE SUCH A ROAD ASKED THE SCARECROW
THE MAN NOW TOOK OJO'S ARM AND LED HIM UP THE ROAD PAST THE LAST OF THE GREAT PLANTS AND NOT TILL HE WAS SAFELY BEYOND THEIR REACH DID HE CEASE HIS WHISTLING
I'VE NEVER NOTICED ANY BUTTERFLIES THERE BUT THAT IS THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ AND IT'S RULED BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE THE TIN WOODMAN OH I'VE HEARD OF HIM EXCLAIMED OJO
WHEN THE SAWHORSE FIRST CAME TO LIFE IT HAD NO EARS AT ALL AND SO COULD NOT HEAR
BEAST
I HAVEN'T ANY NERVES THANK GOODNESS BUT YOUR MUSIC MAKES MY COTTON SHRINK THEN TURN OVER MY RECORD
THE PUMPKINHEAD CONSIDERED THE MATTER GRAVELY
BUT THEY WERE IVORY WHITE AND SHARP POINTED AND NO WONDER THE HOPPERS FEARED THEM
WHAT AH IT'S THE SILENT ONE REMARKED DR PIPT WITHOUT LOOKING UP AND HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT I'M MAKING
THERE SEEMED NO FURNITURE IN THE ROUND DEN BUT SOFT CUSHIONS WERE STREWN ABOUT THE FLOOR AND THESE THEY FOUND MADE VERY COMFORTABLE BEDS
AND IF THERE IS IT'S SURE TO BE A DARK ONE WHY THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH CRIED DOROTHY WITH EAGERNESS
I KNOW OZ PRETTY WELL BUT OJO DOESN'T KNOW IT AT ALL
HANDSOME HOUSES STOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND EACH HAD A GREEN LAWN BEFORE IT AS WELL AS A PRETTY FLOWER GARDEN
SCRAPS DOES THE SAME THING FOOLISHNESS
BUT THEN SHE SAW WHAT IT WAS AND CRIED OH IN A TONE OF ASTONISHMENT
THERE ARE TWO ROADS OF YELLOW BRICKS THROUGH THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY BUT THE ONE WE FOLLOWED IS THE BEST OF THE TWO
ISN'T ONE PUNISHED ENOUGH IN KNOWING HE HAS DONE WRONG
I CAN'T IMAGINE SAID OJO
SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW BOTH FINISHED THEIR HASTY TOILETS AT THE SAME TIME AND AGAIN THEY FACED EACH OTHER
IT MAKES MY WHISKERS CURL IT IS INDEED DREADFUL EXCLAIMED OJO WITH A SHUDDER
THE RESULT WAS THAT THE HISTORIAN BEGGED SO HARD TO BE TOLD THE LATEST NEWS OF OZ SO THAT HE COULD WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE CHILDREN TO READ THAT DOROTHY ASKED PERMISSION OF OZMA AND OZMA GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED
BUT ALL MUNCHKINS PREFER BLUE TO ANYTHING ELSE AND WHEN MY HOUSEWORK GIRL IS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WILL FIND HERSELF TO BE OF SO MANY UNPOPULAR COLORS THAT SHE'LL NEVER DARE BE REBELLIOUS OR IMPUDENT AS SERVANTS ARE SOMETIMES LIABLE TO BE WHEN THEY ARE MADE THE SAME WAY THEIR MISTRESSES ARE UNC NUNKIE NODDED APPROVAL
WHAT NEXT SHE ASKED SCARCELY ABLE TO SPEAK
AGAIN THE SOLDIER PUT UPON THE BOY THE JEWELED HANDCUFFS AND WHITE PRISONER'S ROBE WITH THE PEAKED TOP AND HOLES FOR THE EYES
WHO ARE YOU UNKNOWN BEING HE ASKED
THERE IT IS WHAT ASKED DOROTHY
FORGIVE ME FOR STARING SO RUDELY SAID THE SCARECROW BUT YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGHT MY EYES HAVE EVER BEHELD THAT IS A HIGH COMPLIMENT FROM ONE WHO IS HIMSELF SO BEAUTIFUL MURMURED SCRAPS CASTING DOWN HER SUSPENDER-BUTTON EYES BY LOWERING HER HEAD
THE TEMPTATION WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESISTED
I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE REPLIED OJO
SO I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM
HER EYES WERE TWO SILVER SUSPENDER-BUTTONS CUT FROM A PAIR OF THE MAGICIAN'S OLD TROUSERS AND THEY WERE SEWED ON WITH BLACK THREADS WHICH FORMED THE PUPILS OF THE EYES
THE CREATURE WAS ALL SQUARES AND FLAT SURFACES AND EDGES
I KNOW THIS ROAD PRETTY WELL FOR I'VE CHASED MANY A HONEY-BEE OVER IT HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO THE EMERALD CITY ASKED SCRAPS
THE BOY ON HIS PART WAS GAZING AROUND HIM IN AMAZEMENT FOR NEVER HAD HE DREAMED OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT APARTMENT AS THIS IN WHICH HE STOOD
IN ANOTHER HOUR SAID THE SHAGGY MAN WE SHALL COME IN SIGHT OF THE WALLS OF THE ROYAL CITY HE WAS WALKING AHEAD WITH SCRAPS AND BEHIND THEM CAME THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT
THE GLASS CAT 5
IT WAS A PRETTY HOUSE NEATLY PAINTED AND WITH MANY WINDOWS
BUT YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT SOME STRANGERS HOME WITH ME
THERE IS A LAW AGAINST PICKING SIX-LEAVED CLOVERS BUT I THINK I CAN GET OZMA TO LET YOU HAVE ONE THANK YOU REPLIED OJO
THE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL I HAVE SAID THE BOY
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF OZ THE PEOPLE FAVOR DIFFERENT COLORS
COME IN THEN
ALTHOUGH THESE BEASTS WERE QUITE FREE NO ONE PRESENT WAS ALARMED BY THEM
THAT'S PROPER CAT TALK DECLARED THE WOMAN AND OPENED THE DOOR
AHEAD WAS A BIG ROCK LYING AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THIS BLOCKED THE WAY COMPLETELY
BUT WHAT A SMALL ONE SOLDIER THE SIZE DOESN'T MATTER TOLLYDIGGLE MY DEAR
THERE'S A SOFT CUSHION ALL OVER SAID HE
ONE OF YOUR EYES SEEMS LOOSE AND YOU MAY HAVE TO SEW IT ON TIGHTER
I'M NOT AFRAID DECLARED THE WOOZY
PAUSING TO LOOK BACK IT ASKED
BUT I MUST DO MY BEST TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE AND ALSO MY POOR WIFE MARGOLOTTE
ALSO THERE WERE SEVERAL TABLES WITH MIRROR TOPS AND CABINETS FILLED WITH RARE AND CURIOUS THINGS
BUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SAID IT WOULDN'T BE CALLED FOR BY THE RECIPE IF IT COULDN'T BE FOUND AND THEREFORE I MUST SEARCH UNTIL I FIND IT I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK SAID THE SHAGGY MAN SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
YOU SEE THE POINT DON'T YOU
SCRUBBY UNDER-BRUSH GREW ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY WHILE HUGE ROCKS WERE SCATTERED AROUND IN ABUNDANCE
IT REALLY MUST BE SOME ONE WHISTLING HE DECIDED FOR HE COULD FOLLOW THE STRAINS OF A PRETTY MUNCHKIN MELODY THAT UNC NUNKIE USED TO SING TO HIM
IF THE REST OF YOUR WORLD IS HALF AS BEAUTIFUL I SHALL BE GLAD I'M ALIVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS LIKE I'M SURE SAID THE CAT
CHAPTER FOUR THE GLASS CAT THE CAT WAS MADE OF GLASS SO CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT THAT YOU COULD SEE THROUGH IT AS EASILY AS THROUGH A WINDOW
BUT I SEE NO NEED FOR OJO TO TAKE THE GLASS CAT AND THE WOOZY I PREFER TO REMAIN HERE SAID THE CAT
LOOKING THROUGH THE OPEN PICKETS OF THE FENCE OUR FRIENDS WATCHED THE HORNERS WHO DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY STRANGERS AND FOUND THEM VERY UNUSUAL IN APPEARANCE
THE CAT POUNDED ON THE FLOOR WITH HER GLASS PAWS--GENTLY SO AS NOT TO BREAK THEM--AND THE WOOZY WHICH HAD BEEN ASLEEP WOKE UP TO ASK WHAT THE ROW WAS ABOUT
THEN HE RELATED HOW THE BOY HAD STARTED OUT IN SEARCH OF THE THINGS NEEDED TO MAKE THE MAGIC CHARM WHICH WOULD RESTORE THE UNFORTUNATES TO LIFE AND HOW HE HAD FOUND THE WOOZY AND TAKEN HIM ALONG BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PULL THE THREE HAIRS OUT OF ITS TAIL
SOLDIER RELEASE OJO THE LUCKY AND I BEG YOUR PARDON
THAT'S RATHER GOOD DECLARED THE ANIMAL
IT'S AN INVENTION OF MY OWN AND I FIND IT VERY USEFUL
THAT'S BAD
BUT THE PHONOGRAPH WAS RIGHT BEHIND THEM AND COULD RUN AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME
HE IS SWIFT AS THE WIND UNTIRING AND IS KIND TO HIS FRIENDS
AS THEY DREW NEARER TO THE EMERALD CITY THE TRAVELERS WERE FILLED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE SPLENDID SCENERY THEY BEHELD
AS FOR OJO SOME OF THE CREATURES HAD ATTEMPTED TO TOSS HIM ALSO BUT FINDING HIS BODY TOO HEAVY THEY THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND A ROW OF THE IMPS SAT ON HIM AND HELD HIM FROM ASSISTING DOROTHY IN HER BATTLE
YOU'LL HAVE TO PULL HARDER I'LL HELP YOU EXCLAIMED SCRAPS COMING TO THE BOY'S SIDE
DON'T YOU INQUIRED THE TIN WOODMAN
THESE SMALL MUNCHKIN HOUSES SELDOM HAD MORE THAN ONE ROOM IN THEM
I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING OUT
WHAT IS A WOOZY PLEASE HE INQUIRED
NO SOUND CAME TO HIM THROUGH THE LEAF
JUST THROW ME UP TO THE SCARECROW
THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND CHICKS SHE HAS HATCHED OUT
BACK UP SAID THE SCARECROW TO THOSE BEHIND HIM
YOU MUST TREAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL RESPECTFULLY I WON'T
YOU WERE CERTAINLY STUCK UP UNTIL WE PULLED OUT THOSE QUILLS OBSERVED OJO WITH A LAUGH
BUT WE COULDN'T PULL THEM OUT
BUT A LIVE PHONOGRAPH IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE EVERY SANE PERSON IN THE LAND OF OZ STARK CRAZY NO INSULTS PLEASE ANSWERED THE PHONOGRAPH IN A SURLY TONE
THEY'RE A COMBINATION OF FOOD WHICH PEOPLE WHO EAT ARE VERY FOND OF
IF OZMA FORBIDS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE WHAT SHALL I DO THE SHAGGY MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
SUDDENLY A LEAF BENT LOWER THAN USUAL AND TOUCHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
IN ALL CIVILIZED LANDS THE COMMON PEOPLE HAVE GONE WILD OVER IT MAKES CIVILIZED FOLKS WILD FOLKS EH
IT'S ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS I AM OJO IN THIS COUNTRY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN PEOPLE LIVE WHEREVER OUR RULER TELLS THEM TO
IT HAS TAKEN ME NEARLY SIX YEARS TO PREPARE THESE PRECIOUS GRAINS OF DUST BUT THE LITTLE HEAP ON THAT DISH IS WORTH THE PRICE OF A KINGDOM AND MANY A KING WOULD GIVE ALL HE HAS TO POSSESS IT
NOT QUEER BUT CRAZY SAID OJO
OUR TRAVELERS PREFERRED TO ATTEMPT TO CLIMB THESE ROCKS BY DAYLIGHT AND THEY REALIZED THAT FOR A TIME THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST NIGHT ON THE PLAINS
THEY STOOD MOTIONLESS AND STIFF AS MARBLE STATUES IN EXACTLY THE POSITIONS THEY WERE IN WHEN THE LIQUID STRUCK THEM
A MOMENT LATER WHILE THEY ALL STOOD IN WAITING A SERVANT THREW OPEN A DOOR THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP A TUNE AND OZMA OF OZ ENTERED
COME A LITTLE NEARER PLEASE BEGGED THE GIANT
PUT OIL ON THEM UNTIL THE JOINTS WORKED SMOOTH AGAIN OH EXCLAIMED THE BOY AS IF A GREAT DISCOVERY HAD FLASHED ACROSS HIS MIND
SO THE CLOVER HASN'T BEEN PICKED EH HE SAID
DON'T ASK ME REPLIED SCRAPS
IF IT'S IN THE WILD PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NO ONE THERE WOULD NEED A DARK WELL
HO HO HO
PUBLIC ADVISERS WHEN OJO READ THIS SIGN ALOUD SCRAPS SAID LAUGHINGLY
THE GLASS CAT SEEMED ANNOYED
LOOK IN HIS BASKET AND YOU'LL FIND IT'S NOT THERE
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT UNC NUNKIE WHO WITH OJO STOOD BESIDE HER TOUCHED THE BOTTLE MARKED CLEVERNESS LITTLE SAID HE
WE HORNERS DON'T LIVE ON THE OUTSIDE OF OUR HOMES
WE HAVE WELLS YOU KNOW BUT THEY'RE ALL WELL LIGHTED AND A WELL LIGHTED WELL CANNOT WELL BE A DARK WELL
THIS POWDER MUST NOT BE USED BEFORE TO-MORROW MORNING
THAT COLOR CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES WEST OF THE EMERALD CITY I'LL FIND IT DECLARED OJO
I THINK SCARECROW WE OUGHT TO TAKE HIM TO THE TIN WOODMAN FOR HE'S THE EMP'ROR OF THE WINKIES AND WILL HELP US TO FIND WHAT OJO WANTS OF COURSE REPLIED THE SCARECROW BRIGHTENING AT THE SUGGESTION
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FALLEN TREES NEAR THE HOUSE AND THE QUADLING GOT HIS AXE AND CHOPPED THEM INTO LOGS OF EQUAL LENGTH
HIS HANDS CONSISTED OF PADDED WHITE GLOVES WITH THE FINGERS LONG AND RATHER LIMP AND ON HIS FEET HE WORE MUNCHKIN BOOTS OF BLUE LEATHER WITH BROAD TURNS AT THE TOPS OF THEM
BUT THE MOST PECULIAR THING ABOUT HIM WAS HIS LONG GREEN BEARD WHICH FELL FAR BELOW HIS WAIST AND PERHAPS MADE HIM SEEM TALLER THAN HE REALLY WAS
THEREFORE I MADE ANOTHER LAW FORBIDDING ANYONE FROM PLUCKING A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER OR FROM GATHERING OTHER PLANTS AND HERBS WHICH THE WITCHES BOIL IN THEIR KETTLES TO WORK MAGIC WITH
YOU'RE NOT PRETTY SHE SAID BUT I LIKE YOU
I'LL GET MY BOOK OF RECIPES AND SEE WHAT COMES NEXT SAYING THIS THE MAGICIAN UNLOCKED A DRAWER OF HIS CABINET AND DREW OUT A SMALL BOOK COVERED WITH BLUE LEATHER
AND THERE'S A WOOZY WHAT'S A WOOZY INQUIRED THE SHAGGY MAN
HE FOUND THAT THE MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM PART OF A LOAF OF BREAD AND A SLICE OF CHEESE
I KNOW CRIED SCRAPS
IS THAT MY NAME I--I BELIEVE MY POOR WIFE HAD INTENDED TO NAME YOU ANGELINE SAID THE MAGICIAN
BUT WHEN THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT NOT ONLY THE SHAGGY MAN BUT SCRAPS THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT DOROTHY JUMPED UP AND LOOKED AT HER STRANGE VISITORS IN AMAZEMENT
SO THE OTHER DAY I TOOK AWAY THE PINK BRAINS AND REPLACED THEM WITH TRANSPARENT ONES AND NOW THE GLASS CAT IS SO MODEST AND WELL BEHAVED THAT OZMA HAS DECIDED TO KEEP HER IN THE PALACE AS A PET I THANK YOU SAID THE CAT IN A SOFT VOICE
DO YOU SUPPOSE ALL THE WORLD BECOMES UNLUCKY ONE-SEVENTH OF THE TIME IT WAS THE THIRTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH SAID OJO
I'M THE SHAGGY MAN YES
SO THEY ALL WENT THROUGH THE GATE AND DOROTHY ASKED THE CHIEF HORNER HOW THEY COULD GET THE SCARECROW OFF THE FENCE
AM I CAPTURED HE INQUIRED
THE ONE I TOLD YOU OF
HE IS NOW ONE OF THE FAVORITES OF PRINCESS OZMA AND SHE HAS MADE HIM THE EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES--THE COUNTRY WHERE ALL IS YELLOW WHO IS DOROTHY INQUIRED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT THE HAIR REMAINED FAST
GUARDIAN I HAVE HERE A PRISONER GOOD GRACIOUS
SO HE SAT DOWN AND ATE ALL HE WANTED
BUT NOW THE CAPTIVE FISH FOUND ITS STRENGTH FAILING
HE TOSSED IT TOWARD THE WOOZY WHO CLEVERLY CAUGHT IT IN HIS MOUTH AND ATE IT IN A TWINKLING
THE BODY WAS AS BIG AS A TEN-BUSHEL-BASKET BUT THE PROJECTING QUILLS MADE IT APPEAR TO BE FOUR TIMES BIGGER
OJO WAS HUNGRY THOUGH
AND I'VE A RUBY HEART FINELY POLISHED WHILE SCRAPS HASN'T ANY HEART AT ALL NO MORE HAVE I SAID THE SCARECROW SHAKING HANDS WITH SCRAPS AS IF TO CONGRATULATE HER ON THE FACT
TWO LEGS ARE QUITE UNNECESSARY AND THEY SPOIL ONE'S SHAPE BUT HOW CAN YOU WALK WITH ONLY ONE LEG ASKED OJO
THE WOMAN FORGOT TO GIVE YOU A HEART I'M GLAD SHE DID RETORTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
HALF A DOZEN OF THE GREAT LEAVES WERE BENDING TOWARD HIM FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AS HE STOOD HESITATING ONE OF THEM CLUTCHED HIM IN ITS EMBRACE
TELL ME UNC
THEN HE SAID
BUT TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELVES SO OJO RELATED THE STORY OF HIS VISIT TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND HOW HE MET THERE THE GLASS CAT AND HOW THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE AND OF THE TERRIBLE ACCIDENT TO UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE
I HADN'T MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIS BRAINS MYSELF WHEN FIRST I CAME TO OZ FOR A HUMBUG WIZARD GAVE THEM TO HIM
BUT HOW COULD THEY
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO IN RETURN FOR YOUR KINDNESS YES SAID OJO EARNESTLY YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO DO ME A GREAT FAVOR IF YOU WILL WHAT IS IT ASKED THE WOOZY
A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S VEINS
UNC PUT THE OTHER PIECE OF BREAD IN HIS JACKET POCKET AFTER WHICH HE AGAIN SAID AS HE WALKED OUT THROUGH THE DOORWAY
THAT'S ONE LEG TOO MANY IT SEEMS TO ME NO DECLARED DOROTHY IT'S JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER YOU DON'T NEED THEM ARGUED THE HOPPER OBSTINATELY
BUT AFTER THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS RESTORED THOSE POOR PEOPLE TO LIFE YOU MUST TAKE AWAY HIS MAGIC POWERS I WILL PROMISED OZMA
LET'S GO IN THE BOY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
ONLY IN MY MAGIC PICTURE WHICH SHOWS ME ALL SCENES OF INTEREST IN THE LAND OF OZ I FEAR THE PICTURE DIDN'T DO HER JUSTICE SAID THE SCARECROW
I NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE YOU KNOW OF COURSE NOT SAID OJO
DR PIPT WILL MAKE NO MORE POWDER OF LIFE I PROMISE YOU SAID SHE
GIVE HIM THE NEEDLE AND THREAD AND LET HIM MEND HIS WAYS HA HA HA LAUGHED THE CHIEF AND THE OTHER HORNERS AT ONCE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
NOW TELL ME PLEASE WHAT MAGIC THINGS MUST YOU FIND CONTINUED THE WIZARD ADDRESSING OJO
HAVE YOU NOW SECURED ALL THE THINGS YOU WERE IN SEARCH OF NOT QUITE ALL ANSWERED OJO
BUT SOME ARE JUST CHILDREN POOR THINGS
ONLY ONE AND PLENTY ENOUGH
BUT IT WILL TAKE ME SIX YEARS--SIX LONG WEARY YEARS OF STIRRING FOUR KETTLES WITH BOTH FEET AND BOTH HANDS WAS THE AGONIZED REPLY
I SAW IT DONE MYSELF
HE'D SMASH ME THAT'S WHAT WE SHALL DO IF YOU STAY HERE OJO DECLARED
SOME PEOPLE JACK PUMPKINHEAD TOLD ME ABOUT HE REPLIED
SEE THERE ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER
I SUPPOSE YOU STRANGERS THOUGHT THEIR CITY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN OURS BECAUSE YOU JUDGED FROM APPEARANCES AND THEY HAVE HANDSOME MARBLE HOUSES AND MARBLE STREETS
SO HERE'S THE PROPOSITION
IT SAYS OIL AND THERE MUST BE OIL SOMEWHERE IN A LIVE MAN'S BODY OR THE BOOK WOULDN'T ASK FOR IT ALL RIGHT RETURNED OJO TRYING NOT TO FEEL DISCOURAGED
STILL LOWER BUT NEARLY IN FRONT OF OZMA SAT THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ AND ON A SMALL TABLE BESIDE HIM WAS THE GOLDEN VASE FROM DOROTHY'S ROOM INTO WHICH SCRAPS HAD DROPPED THE STOLEN CLOVER
AND THEN HE ADDED
TURNS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES TO SOLID MARBLE
FROM THE NEIGHBORING YARDS CAME THE LOW MOOING OF COWS WAITING TO BE MILKED
I THINK HE IS THE HANDSOMEST MAN I'VE SEEN SINCE I CAME TO LIFE HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES QUOTED THE SHAGGY MAN
BUT THIS DANGER MUST BE FACED IF WE INTEND TO SAVE POOR UNC NUNKIE
SAID THE SHAGGY MAN HALTING HERE
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED THE SHAGGY MAN STERNLY
AFTER THE PATCHWORK GIRL CAME THE WOOZY WHO HELD A PART OF HER SKIRT IN HIS MOUTH
COULD THE LEAF WHISTLE OJO WONDERED
KIZZLE-KAZZLE-KORE
LAUGH AT THEIR POOR JOKE AND TELL EM IT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR A HORNER
SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW 14
THEN IF YOU SHOULD UNLUCKILY FAIL TO SECURE ANY ONE OF THE THINGS NEEDED I WILL HAVE LOST NO TIME
IT'S THE FAULT OF MY RECORDS
HOW ABSURD
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE PEACE IS DECLARED COME WITH ME TO MY DWELLING AND I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO MY DAUGHTERS SAID THE CHIEF
THE TIN WOODMAN'S CASTLE IS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE WINKIE COUNTRY AND SO IT CAN'T BE A GREAT WAY FROM HERE FEARING THEY MIGHT DRIFT TOO FAR DOROTHY AND OJO NOW STOOD UP AND RAISED THE SCARECROW IN THEIR ARMS AS HIGH AS THEY COULD THUS ALLOWING HIM A GOOD VIEW OF THE COUNTRY
HE IS NOW LIVING NEAR THE EMERALD CITY AND IS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE PRINCESS OZMA WHO RULES ALL THE LAND OF OZ NO
YOU CAN'T SAID THE MAGICIAN
AFTER HER CAME SCRAPS AND THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO SLEEP BUT PREFERRED TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE MISCHIEVOUS TOTTENHOTS
A ROPE WAS TIED AROUND HIS WAIST TO HOLD HIM IN SHAPE FOR HE WAS STUFFED WITH STRAW IN EVERY PART OF HIM EXCEPT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WHERE AT ONE TIME THE WIZARD OF OZ HAD PLACED SAWDUST MIXED WITH NEEDLES AND PINS TO SHARPEN HIS WITS
THEY SOON FOUND IT HARD CLIMBING FOR THE ROCKS WERE UNEVEN AND FULL OF SHARP POINTS AND EDGES AND NOW THERE WAS NO PATH AT ALL
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY LAWS SEEM FOOLISH TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM SHE SAID
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO SAID SCRAPS
UNC LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STROKED HIS LONG BEARD
SEEING THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN SCRAPS THEY FORBORE TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HER
WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS SAID
AT ONCE THEY HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THIS FAMOUS ROAD LOOKED LIKE
THEREFORE IT HAD NO EARS BUT HEARD SOUNDS THROUGH TWO OPENINGS IN THE UPPER CORNERS
THE PATCHES ARE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SO A PATCHWORK QUILT IS A VERY PRETTY AND GORGEOUS THING TO LOOK AT
WHEN THE HOUSE BEFORE THEM WAS VACANT DOROTHY AND OJO LEANED OVER THE HOLE AND LOOKED IN BUT COULD SEE NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK
BUT HOW I DON'T KNOW CAUSE NO ONE EVER HAS BEEN PUNISHED IN OZ SINCE I KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE
IF WE HAD WINGS WE MIGHT FLY OVER THE WALL BUT WE CANNOT CLIMB IT AND UNLESS WE GET TO THE EMERALD CITY I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THE THINGS TO RESTORE UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE ALL VERY TRUE ANSWERED THE SHAGGY MAN QUIETLY
SHE GREETED DOROTHY WITH A KISS THE SHAGGY MAN WITH A SMILE THE LITTLE OLD WIZARD WITH A FRIENDLY HANDSHAKE AND THEN SHE PRESSED THE SCARECROW'S STUFFED ARM AND CRIED MERRILY
IT'S TOO BIG A RIVER AND THE WATER MOVES AWFUL FAST THERE OUGHT TO BE A FERRYMAN WITH A BOAT SAID THE SCARECROW
AND UNC NEVER SPOKE ANY MORE WORDS THAN HE WAS OBLIGED TO SO HIS LITTLE NEPHEW WHO LIVED ALONE WITH HIM HAD LEARNED TO UNDERSTAND A GREAT DEAL FROM ONE WORD
YOU ARE ACCUSED OF HAVING BROKEN THIS LAW EVEN AFTER YOU HAD BEEN WARNED NOT TO DO SO OJO HUNG HIS HEAD AND WHILE HE HESITATED HOW TO REPLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE FOR HIM
THE SHAGGY MAN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND GRIEVED BUT HE KNEW THAT OZMA NEVER MADE MISTAKES AND SO OJO MUST REALLY HAVE BROKEN THE LAW OF OZ
THE SCARECROW SCRAPS AND THE PUMPKINHEAD WERE TIRELESS AND HAD NO NEED TO SLEEP SO THEY SAT UP AND TALKED TOGETHER ALL NIGHT
THE BOY HAD NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE
IT WOULD BE CRUEL--ONE OF THE MOST CRUEL AND HEARTLESS DEEDS I EVER HEARD OF ASSERTED THE TIN WOODMAN
I HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST AND YET I THINK I'LL NOW EAT SOME OF MY CRACKERS AND CHEESE SCRAPS DANCED UP AND DOWN THE PATH
IN A FLASH HE WAS IN THE DARK
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MAN THAT TOTO OBJECTED TO AND WHEN HE SLOWLY ROSE TO HIS FOOT THEY SAW WHAT IT WAS
IF HE COULD SCARE HORNERS AS WELL AS HE DOES CROWS IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE HIM THERE THIS IS TERRIBLE SAID OJO ALMOST READY TO CRY
ONLY A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
THE TAIL THE HAIRS WON'T COME OUT
TOWARD EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THEY REACHED A SANDY PLAIN WHERE WALKING WAS DIFFICULT
OJO PUSHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL AWAY AND RAN TO UNC NUNKIE FILLED WITH A TERRIBLE FEAR FOR THE ONLY FRIEND AND PROTECTOR HE HAD EVER KNOWN
NOR CAN I GNAW AWAY THE BOARDS AS I HAVE NO TEETH YOU'RE NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE CREATURE AFTER ALL REMARKED SCRAPS
AND THERE'S A GLASS CAT GLASS ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN
WHOOP-TE-DOODLE-DOO
WHEN THE GROUP OF ADVENTURERS PEERED THROUGH THE BARS OF THE FENCE THEY THOUGHT THIS FOREST LOOKED MORE GLOOMY AND FORBIDDING THAN ANY THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
WHEN THEY DID SO THEY TURNED TO LOOK TOWARD THE GIANT'S CAVE AND AT THAT MOMENT THE FEROCIOUS MISTER YOOP THREW THE PATCHWORK GIRL AT THEM
ONE DAY SHE CAME BACK FROM A JOURNEY BRINGING SOME OF THE POWDER OF LIFE WHICH DR PIPT HAD GIVEN HER
TOTO WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RESIDENCE OF THE TIN WOODMAN AND BEING ASSURED A JOYFUL WELCOME HE RAN AHEAD AND BARKED SO LOUDLY AT THE FRONT DOOR THAT THE TIN WOODMAN HEARD HIM AND CAME OUT IN PERSON TO SEE IF IT WERE REALLY HIS OLD FRIEND TOTO
BUT SUDDENLY THE PATCHWORK GIRL THREW UP ONE ARM WHICH KNOCKED THE BOTTLE OF POWDER FROM THE CROOKED MAN'S HAND AND SENT IT FLYING ACROSS THE ROOM
TWO KNOTS OF WOOD FORMED THE EYES AND THE MOUTH WAS A GASH CHOPPED IN THE LOG
THE PASSAGE RAN STRAIGHT FOR A LITTLE WAY AND THEN MADE A BEND TO THE RIGHT AND ANOTHER SHARP TURN TO THE LEFT AFTER WHICH IT WENT STRAIGHT AGAIN
ANYHOW MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PINK KITTEN AND YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT
THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ CHAPTER ONE OJO AND UNC NUNKIE WHERE'S THE BUTTER UNC NUNKIE ASKED OJO
THE EMPEROR GREETED OJO AND SCRAPS WITH CORDIAL HOSPITALITY AND USHERED THE ENTIRE PARTY INTO HIS HANDSOME TIN PARLOR WHERE ALL THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES WERE MADE OF TIN
SHE FOLLOWED JUST AFTER THE SCARECROW
THEN HE SHUT DOWN THE WINDOW AND TURNED HIS CHAIR TO FACE THE ROOM FOR THE SUN WAS SINKING BEHIND THE TREE-TOPS AND IT WAS GROWING COOL
OH
A GOOD FRIEND 12
I HAVE SOME PATCHES AND SCRAPS PUT AWAY AND IF YOU WILL WAIT TWO OR THREE DAYS I'LL MAKE YOU A LOVELY HAT THAT WILL MATCH THE REST OF YOU NEVER MIND THE HAT SAID SCRAPS SHAKING HER YARN BRAIDS
ON HIS BREAST HUNG A MEDALLION BEARING A PICTURE OF PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AND IN HIS HAND AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT OJO WAS A SHARP KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A DAGGER
THEY SOON SEPARATED FROM THE MUNCHKIN BOY WHO WAS LED BY THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS DOWN A SIDE STREET TOWARD THE PRISON
DIKSEY WENT CLOSE TO THE FENCE AND SAID
IT WOULD SETTLE DOWN AT TIMES AND MAKE HER SQUAT AND DUMPY AND THEN SHE HAD TO ROLL HERSELF IN THE ROAD UNTIL HER BODY STRETCHED OUT AGAIN
DON'T BLAME ME YOU'VE BUNGLED EVERYTHING DR PIPT ADDED THE GLASS CAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY
THAT'S A BETTER JOKE THAN DIKSEY'S
THE LITTLE BOY BROUGHT THE STOOL AND SAT BESIDE HIS UNCLE MUNCHING THE DRY BREAD SLOWLY AND SEEMING IN DEEP THOUGHT
AFTER STIRRING THOSE FOUR KETTLES FOR SIX YEARS I AM GLAD TO HAVE A LITTLE REST YOU WILL HAVE TO DO MOST OF THE TALKING SAID OJO FOR UNC IS CALLED THE SILENT ONE AND USES FEW WORDS I KNOW
I--ER--I'M SO GLAD I'VE MET YOU MISS SCRAPS
SHE KNEW AT ONCE THAT BECAUSE THE BOY HAD TAKEN THE CLOVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT OJO HAD GIVEN HER THE BASKET SO THEY WOULD NOT FIND THE CLOVER IN HIS POSSESSION AND HAVE PROOF OF HIS CRIME
THEY WERE LITTLE FOLKS IN SIZE AND HAD BODIES ROUND AS BALLS AND SHORT LEGS AND ARMS
I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER THINGS TO FIND YOU KNOW BUT THE GLASS CAT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND INQUIRED IN HER SCORNFUL WAY
IT'S MUCH EASIER WALKING THAN TO CLIMB OVER THE HILLS HOW ABOUT THAT SIGN ASKED OJO
YES OF COURSE
LET US GO TO THE FENCE AND THEN WE MAY FIND A WAY SUGGESTED SCRAPS
SEEKING A REFUGE IT BEGAN TO DRAG THE RAFT TOWARD THE SHORE
THE EMERALD CITY WHICH IS THE MOST SPLENDID AS WELL AS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITY IN ANY FAIRYLAND IS SURROUNDED BY A HIGH THICK WALL OF GREEN MARBLE POLISHED SMOOTH AND SET WITH GLISTENING EMERALDS
GOOD MORNING SAID THE DONKEY IN HIS DEEP VOICE WHICH SEEMED BIGGER THAN HE WAS
I FORGIVE YOU SO DO I ADDED SCRAPS
DO YOU LIVE HERE MY GOOD MAN ASKED THE SCARECROW
THEY ALL BECAME SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL
A GILL HOW MUCH IS A GILL WHY--A GILL IS A GILL OF COURSE ANSWERED THE SCARECROW WHO DID NOT WISH TO DISPLAY HIS IGNORANCE
AND I--I HAD NOT SEEN THE EMERALD CITY THEN NOR YOU AND I THOUGHT A GIRL WHO WOULD MAKE SUCH A SILLY LAW WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO HELP ANYONE IN TROUBLE OZMA REGARDED HIM MUSINGLY HER CHIN RESTING UPON HER HAND
IT'S ON THE TABLE SO YOU CAN EAT IT WHEN YOU GET HUNGRY
NOR DO WE CARE TO COME OUT AND BE CHEWED UP BY A SAVAGE BEAST OR SLAPPED BY AN ANGRY GIRL
AND IF IT'S ANYWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ WE'RE BOUND TO FIND IT WELL WE'RE BOUND TO SEARCH FOR IT ANYHOW SAID THE SCARECROW
THAT'S NO AFFAIR OF MINE
THE PATCHWORK GIRL ENTERED LAST OF ALL FOR TOTO KEPT CLOSE BESIDE HIS LITTLE MISTRESS
WHAT IS THAT OJO ASKED FOR THIS SEEMED EVEN MORE STRANGE AND UNUSUAL THAN A GLASS CAT
NEVER MIND
NEVER MIND
NEVER MIND
YES SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE WERE SO STARTLED THAT THEY BOTH LEAPED BACKWARD AND BUMPED TOGETHER AND UNC'S HEAD JOGGLED THE SHELF ABOVE THEM AND UPSET THE BOTTLE CONTAINING THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION
A PLACE TO SLEEP SAID OJO
WELL HE CAN'T GRAB BUT ONE AT A TIME AND I'LL GO FIRST
HE JARRED ME TERRIBLY
STOP--STOP
HOW ARE YOU OJO PLACED HIS HAND IN THE FLABBY STUFFED GLOVE THAT SERVED THE SCARECROW FOR A HAND AND THE SCARECROW PRESSED IT SO CORDIALLY THAT THE STRAW IN HIS GLOVE CRACKLED
PLEASE DON'T QUARREL BEGGED OJO
I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IT HE SOBBED MISERABLY
ONLY IF IT ISN'T JUST WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO BE YOU MUST GO WHERE IT IS THE AGED MUNCHKIN WRIGGLED AGAIN AND STARED AT HIS SMALL NEPHEW AS IF DISTURBED BY HIS ARGUMENT
THE FOOLISH OWL MUST BE FOOLISH OR SHE WOULDN'T BE THE FOOLISH OWL
ALL READY NOW
OJO BEGAN TO THINK OZMA MUST BE A VERY BAD AND OPPRESSIVE RULER FOR SUCH A LOVELY FAIRYLAND AS OZ
MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE OJO LOOKED AT THE MAGICIAN WITH MUCH AWE AND CURIOSITY
BUT GIVE ATTENTION WHILE I MENTION ONE WISE YELLOW HEN AND NINE FINE TINY PIGLETS LIVING IN A GOLDEN PEN
I'M AN ORIGINAL IF YOU PLEASE AND THEREFORE INCOMPARABLE
SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE CITY A BAND COULD BE HEARD PLAYING SWEET MUSIC
WHEN MY OLD GRANDMOTHER SEWS SUCH THINGS TOGETHER SHE CALLS IT A CRAZY-QUILT
BUT NOT A GRAIN OF POWDER CAME OUT
BUT THE SHAGGY MAN BEGAN TO WHISTLE AGAIN AND AT THE SOUND THE LEAVES ALL STRAIGHTENED UP ON THEIR STEMS AND KEPT STILL
OH I CAME FROM A BED-QUILT I GUESS
UGH
WE'LL TAKE A WHOLE YELLOW BUTTERFLY ALIVE AND WELL TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN AND LET HIM PULL THE LEFT WING OFF NO YOU WON'T SAID THE TIN WOODMAN
IT LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE EMERALD CITY AND HOW SHALL WE FIND THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS BY KEEPING ALONG THE PATH YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING
OJO BROKE SOME BRANCHES FROM A TREE AND WITH THEM WHIPPED THE FIRE UNTIL IT WAS EXTINGUISHED
AND REMEMBER YOU BELONG TO ME AND MUST RETURN HERE AS SOON AS YOUR MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED I'M GOING WITH SCRAPS AND OJO ANNOUNCED THE GLASS CAT
NOW YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES THEY DID SO AND TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT FOUND THE WALL AND THE GATEWAY FAR BEHIND THEM WHILE IN FRONT THE FORMER BLUE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS HAD GIVEN WAY TO GREEN FIELDS WITH PRETTY FARM-HOUSES SCATTERED AMONG THEM
CAN YOU NOT MUCH REPLIED THE WOMAN
WON'T YOU TELL US A STORY I'M NOT GOOD AT STORIES WAS THE REPLY
VOICE JUST NOW IS A LITTLE OUT OF TRAINING
BUT IT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR THE FOOLISH SAID THE DONKEY ADMIRINGLY
AMIABILITY IS ALSO GOOD AND TRUTH SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
IF MY PATCHES GET A SOAK IT WILL BE A SORRY JOKE
AS THE SCARECROW CAME IN SIGHT OF THE PARTY OF TRAVELERS HE REINED IN HIS WOODEN STEED AND DISMOUNTED GREETING THE SHAGGY MAN WITH A SMILING NOD
I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE A HEART OJO REMINDED HER
I'LL TAKE ANYTHING I HAVE TO
QUITE A COMPLIMENT I DECLARE EXCLAIMED THE DONKEY TURNING TO LOOK AT SCRAPS
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND I ARE SUPERIOR PEOPLE AND NOT MADE LIKE THESE POOR HUMANS WHY SHOULD I UNDERSTAND THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE ASKED THE GIRL
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE HE REPLIED BEGINNING TO LAUGH AGAIN
AT OZMA'S FEET CROUCHED TWO ENORMOUS BEASTS EACH THE LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL OF ITS KIND
AFTER PASSING THE WALL OF WATER THE CURRENT DID NOT CHANGE OR FLOW BACKWARD ANY MORE BUT CONTINUED TO SWEEP THEM STEADILY FORWARD
PSHAW SAID THE WOOZY UNGRATEFULLY I WANT TO TASTE SOMETHING
HERE WAS NOTHING GRIMY OR FADED INDEED
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW
LET US BE GOOD COMRADES AND AS HAPPY AND CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE FOR WE ARE LIKELY TO MEET WITH PLENTY OF TROUBLE ON OUR WAY IT WAS NEARLY SUNDOWN WHEN THEY CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND SAW SPREAD OUT BEFORE THEM A DELIGHTFUL LANDSCAPE
HOW MANY HORNS DO THE HORNERS HAVE ASKED DOROTHY
WHO HAS SAVED ME SIR CAN'T YOU SEE REPLIED THE OTHER WITH A SMILE
AFTER THAT THE PATCHWORK GIRL KEPT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE DARTING FLAMES BUT THE WOOZY LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE LIKE A BIG DOG AND SEEMED TO ENJOY ITS WARMTH
ALL I HAVE SEEN SO FAR HAVE PALE COLORLESS SKINS AND CLOTHES AS BLUE AS THE COUNTRY THEY LIVE IN WHILE I AM OF MANY GORGEOUS COLORS--FACE AND BODY AND CLOTHES
WHY THEY ARE NOT TREES AT ALL SAID SCRAPS
THE MAGICIAN WAS STIRRING ALL FOUR OF THESE KETTLES AT THE SAME TIME TWO WITH HIS HANDS AND TWO WITH HIS FEET TO THE LATTER WOODEN LADLES BEING STRAPPED FOR THIS MAN WAS SO VERY CROOKED THAT HIS LEGS WERE AS HANDY AS HIS ARMS
SOME SORT OF AN ANIMAL
WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE LIKE DOROTHY INQUIRED
BUT MY NAME IS SCRAPS--AND NOW YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME NOT QUITE ALL RETURNED DOROTHY WITH A SMILE
I HOPE IT WON'T PUT YOU OUT ANY NO SAID THE OTHER I WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR
THEY BRIBE THE LAZY QUADLING 26
THANKS BUT NOW OJO RUSHED UP AND THREW HIS ARMS JOYFULLY ABOUT HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN HUGGED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW TENDERLY AND STROKED HIS HAIR AND WIPED AWAY THE BOY'S TEARS WITH A HANDKERCHIEF FOR OJO WAS CRYING FROM PURE HAPPINESS
BEWARE THE WOOZY WHICH MAY MEAN THERE'S ONLY ONE IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ THEN SAID SCRAPS SUPPOSE WE GO IN AND FIND HIM
IF I THINK OF ANOTHER SUCH JOKE I'LL TRY TO FORGET IT GOOD CRIED THE CHIEF HORNER
IT HAD BEEN RUDELY MADE IN THE BEGINNING TO SAW LOGS UPON SO THAT ITS BODY WAS A SHORT LENGTH OF A LOG AND ITS LEGS WERE STOUT BRANCHES FITTED INTO FOUR HOLES MADE IN THE BODY
BUT HER ADVICE IS EXCELLENT
WOW SAID TOTO AGAIN AND DOROTHY SAW HE WAS LOOKING ALONG THE BANK OF THE RIVER
HE TOOK HIS WIFE'S CLOTHESLINE TO BIND THESE LOGS TOGETHER SO THAT THEY WOULD FORM A RAFT AND OJO FOUND SOME STRIPS OF WOOD AND NAILED THEM ALONG THE TOPS OF THE LOGS TO RENDER THEM MORE FIRM
THE LITTLE GIRL WORE A PLAIN GINGHAM DRESS AND A CHECKED SUNBONNET AS SHE KNEW THEY WERE BEST FITTED FOR TRAVEL
THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY GROWLING FOR I AM NOT ANGRY
IT GROWLS AND GRUMBLES AND CLICKS AND SCRATCHES SO IT SPOILS THE MUSIC AND YOUR MACHINERY RUMBLES SO THAT THE RACKET DROWNS EVERY TUNE YOU ATTEMPT THAT ISN'T MY FAULT
THEY GREW TO LIKE TOTO TOO AND THE LITTLE DOG ALLOWED THEM TO PAT HIM ON HIS HEAD WHICH GAVE THE LITTLE ONES MUCH JOY
YOU MUST PROMISE ME TO STOP THROWING QUILLS AT PEOPLE I WON'T PROMISE ANYTHING OF THE SORT DECLARED CHISS
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY OFFER QUADLING I'LL DO IT DECIDED THE MAN
THEY CLUNG TO THE TREE UNTIL THEY FOUND THE WATER FLOWING THE RIGHT WAY WHEN THEY LET GO AND PERMITTED THE RAFT TO RESUME ITS VOYAGE
THEN THEY TALKED OF THE WOOZY WHICH WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE ANIMAL ANY OF THEM HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN--EXCEPT PERHAPS THE LIVE SAWHORSE
MOMBI GAVE TO DR PIPT A POWDER OF PERPETUAL YOUTH IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS POWDER OF LIFE BUT SHE CHEATED HIM WICKEDLY FOR THE POWDER OF YOUTH WAS NO GOOD AND COULD WORK NO MAGIC AT ALL PERHAPS THE POWDER OF LIFE COULDN'T EITHER SAID OJO
MAY I GO WITH OJO TO HELP HIM WOULD YOU LIKE TO RETURNED OZMA
PEACE IS DECLARED 24
AND SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO APOLOGIZE RETURNED THE CHIEF
WE CLIMBED OVER ANSWERED OJO
CHAPTER NINE THEY MEET THE WOOZY THERE SEEM TO BE VERY FEW HOUSES AROUND HERE AFTER ALL REMARKED OJO AFTER THEY HAD WALKED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE
THEN RISING HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WAKENED THE GLASS CAT
BUT MY WIFE HAS GONE FISHING FOR RED EELS TO-DAY SO SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE TO MIND THE CHILDREN SCRAPS PROMISED TO DO THAT AND THE CHILDREN WERE NOT SO SHY WHEN THE PATCHWORK GIRL SAT DOWN TO PLAY WITH THEM
PRESENTLY THE TIN WOODMAN CHANGED HIS POSITION AND AT ONCE OJO TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND HELD HIS CRYSTAL VIAL UNDER THE EMPEROR'S KNEE JOINT
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT FOR--WELL I DECLARE
OVER THIS CAVERN WAS A BIG SIGN WHICH DOROTHY READ WITH MUCH CURIOSITY SPEAKING THE WORDS ALOUD THAT ALL MIGHT KNOW WHAT THEY SAID
SHE CALLED ME BUNGLE YES SIGHED THE MAGICIAN
THEN LET'S TAKE IT AND GO REPLIED OJO
TOTO RAN AROUND IT AND BARKED
NONE WITH THE SAME GORGEOUS VARIEGATED BEAUTY HE CONFESSED
I'LL PROMISE SAID THE WOOZY CHEERFULLY
IT STOOD CLOSE TO THE ROADSIDE AND OVER THE DOOR WAS A SIGN THAT READ
IN THE CENTER OF THE CITY OUR FRIENDS COULD SEE THE TOPS OF MANY MAGNIFICENT TREES SOME NEARLY AS TALL AS THE SPIRES OF THE BUILDINGS AND THE SHAGGY MAN TOLD THEM THAT THESE TREES WERE IN THE ROYAL GARDENS OF PRINCESS OZMA
YOU LET US ALONE AND WE'LL LET YOU ALONE YOU BEGAN IT DECLARED DOROTHY
A LITTLE MAID WHO USED TO LIVE IN KANSAS BUT IS NOW A PRINCESS OF OZ
LET ME GO BUT NEITHER STRUGGLES NOR PROTESTS HAD ANY EFFECT WHATEVER
WHAT'S UP CHIEF ASKED DIKSEY WINKING NINETEEN TIMES AT THE NINETEEN GIRLS WHO DEMURELY CAST DOWN THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEIR FATHER WAS LOOKING
THERE'S A HOUSE AT LAST CRIED OJO
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE RAG-TIME SCRAPS OUGHT TO BEING RAGS HERSELF SAID THE CAT
THE SAWHORSE WAS ALMOST AS CURIOUS AS ITS RIDER
IT HAD NEVER WORN A BRIDLE
HE COULD IF HE DIDN'T RUST HIS TIN JOINTS
LET ME GO IT SHOUTED ANGRILY
IT'S HARD TO BE A GLASSY CAT NO CAT CAN BE MORE HARD THAN THAT
LAST OF ALL DR PIPT WAS THERE AND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN SAT HUMPED UP IN A CHAIR SEEMING VERY DEJECTED BUT KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON THE LIFELESS FORM OF HIS WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHOM HE FONDLY LOVED BUT WHOM HE NOW FEARED WAS LOST TO HIM FOREVER
DIDN'T YOU FEEL THE GROUND TREMBLE
I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE BOY
I AM NOW IN SPLENDID CONDITION AND AM REALLY OBLIGED TO THE TOTTENHOTS FOR THEIR KIND TREATMENT I FEEL MUCH THE SAME WAY SAID SCRAPS
WHEN THE VISITORS HAD EATEN HEARTILY OF THIS FARE THE WOMAN SAID TO THEM
THERE WAS MUCH TO INTEREST THEM ALONG THE ROADWAY FOR THE HOUSES WERE NOW SET MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER AND THEY MET A GOOD MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING OR GOING FROM ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER
CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE I--I THOUGHT I HAD A VERY TERRIFYING GROWL SAID THE WOOZY WITH HESITATION
BUT I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO GO IF WE WANT THAT GILL OF WATER FROM THE DARK WELL SO THEY SAID GOOD-BYE TO THE PUMPKINHEAD AND RESUMED THEIR TRAVELS HEADING NOW DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHERE MOUNTAINS AND ROCKS AND CAVERNS AND FORESTS OF GREAT TREES ABOUNDED
UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT-FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
I DON'T KNOW SHE REPLIED
IT IS A GREAT TALENT TO BE ABLE TO FLASH FIRE FROM YOUR EYES
BUT THEY HAVE THOSE TERRIBLE HORNS AND UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL THEY PRICK US WITH THE POINTS RETURNED THE CHAMPION WITH A SHUDDER
I THOUGHT SO SAID HE AND I AM SORRY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS MY PAINFUL DUTY TO ARREST YOU ARREST ME EXCLAIMED THE BOY
THAT'S MORE THAN A GILL I'M SURE AND THE CROOKED MAGICIAN MAY MEASURE IT TO SUIT HIMSELF
THAT MEANS THE WINKIE COUNTRY ALL RIGHT FOR IT'S THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ REMARKED DOROTHY
IT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO TO BED SAID OJO
AND THAT WAY POINTING WITH THE OTHER HAND THE RIVER RUNS BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS WHERE DANGEROUS PEOPLE DWELL THE SCARECROW LOOKED AT THE WATER BEFORE THEM
WHEN WE REACH IT THE GOOD PEOPLE WILL SURELY WELCOME US AND GIVE US A NIGHT'S LODGING BUT HOWEVER FAR THEY WALKED THE LIGHT SEEMED TO GET NO NEARER SO BY AND BY THE CAT STOPPED SHORT SAYING
I'LL NOT GO BACK TO HIS DEN OF MY OWN ACCORD
THIS WAS THE GUARDIAN OF THE GATE AND AT THE MOMENT THEY ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WAS PLAYING A TUNE UPON A MOUTH-ORGAN
YOU NEED A LOT YOU KNOW SUCH AS ARE NOT EASILY FOUND IT IS TRUE SIGHED DR PIPT
THIS CAT TOTO SHE SAID TO HIM IS MADE OF GLASS SO YOU MUSTN'T BOTHER IT OR CHASE IT ANY MORE THAN YOU DO MY PINK KITTEN
THE DINNER BEING NOW CONCLUDED THEY ALL WENT TO OZMA'S DRAWING-ROOM WHERE THEY PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING BEFORE IT CAME TIME TO RETIRE
SO THEY ALL TURNED THEIR BACKS TO THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY WISHED TO GO AND BEGAN WALKING BACKWARD
ONLY ONE CHAIR WAS DRAWN UP TO THE TABLE WHERE A PLACE WAS SET FOR ONE PERSON
BUT DO NOT WORRY MY DEAR
I THINK WE SHALL KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR THIS PATH IS THE WIDEST AND BEST
THE RAFT SLOWED DOWN YET IT DID NOT STOP BECAUSE THE FISH WOULD NOT LET IT
A--A SORT OF SLAVE HE EXPLAINED
I DON'T DOUBT IT RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRINGLY
THERE ARE FOUR GATES ONE FACING THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE WINKIES ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS AND ONE FACING THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS
BUT I NEVER CRITICISE MY FRIENDS
IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR YOU TO YELL ALL TOGETHER FOR THAT MADE ME AS ANGRY AS I HAVE EVER BEEN
AND SO--WELL WELL
HERE'S TO THE HALE OLD BALE OF STRAW THAT'S CUT FROM THE WAVING GRAIN THE SWEETEST SIGHT MAN EVER SAW IN FOREST DELL OR PLAIN
THEN HE CONTINUED
BETTER THAN MINE ECHOED THE GLASS CAT
THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE GATE WHEN THE GOLDEN BARS SLID BACK AND A TALL SOLDIER STEPPED OUT AND FACED THEM
THEN THE CAT LED SCRAPS TO ANOTHER BED AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT
NOTHING GROWS IN OUR YARD BUT THE BREAD TREE HE MUSED AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO MORE LOAVES ON THAT TREE
JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S A DEAR OLD CHUM WHO MIGHT BE CALLED A CHUMP BUT WON RENOWN BY RIDING ROUND UPON A MAGIC GUMP
I HAVE ALSO HAD BROUGHT HERE THE MARBLE STATUES OF YOUR UNCLE AND OF MARGOLOTTE WHICH ARE STANDING IN THE NEXT ROOM THEY WERE ALL GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
TO BE LEFT-HANDED IS USUALLY TO BE TWO-HANDED
THE TIN WOODMAN IS VERY KIND-HEARTED WAS THE REPLY AND HE HATES TO SEE ANY LIVING THING HURT IN ANY WAY ARE FLOWERS ALIVE ASKED SCRAPS
THE EMERALD CITY HE REPLIED
WE NEVER GO THERE WAS THE REPLY
WHY THIS IS YOUR PRISON REPLIED TOLLYDIGGLE AND IN ME BEHOLD YOUR JAILOR
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE HAS BROKEN THE LAW BUT NO ONE EVER DOES THAT THEN HE MUST BE INNOCENT AND SOON WILL BE RELEASED
THAT THE CURRENT OF THE RIVER HAD REVERSED AND THE WATER WAS NOW FLOWING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION--TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS
NOTICING THE MIRROR SHE STOOD BEFORE IT AND EXAMINED HER EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES WITH AMAZEMENT--HER BUTTON EYES PEARL BEAD TEETH AND PUFFY NOSE
STILL NO HOUSES WERE YET TO BE SEEN NEAR THE ROAD
THE YELLOW BRICKS ARE NOT MOVING BUT THE WHOLE ROAD IS ANSWERED OJO
BUT OZMA SAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS AND IT WAS THE LITTLE WIZARD WHO ANSWERED SCRAPS
I'M CRAZY NOW ACCORDING TO YOUR STATEMENT
THOSE FENCE-BOARDS ARE MADE OF WOOD AND IF THE WOOZY STANDS CLOSE TO THE FENCE AND LETS HIS EYES FLASH FIRE THEY MIGHT SET FIRE TO THE FENCE AND BURN IT UP
YES HE REPLIED
SO YOU MAY HAVE THE THREE HAIRS AND WELCOME
WHILE SHE WAITED FOR HER HUSBAND TO FINISH MAKING HIS POWDER OF LIFE THE WOMAN HAD FOUND AMPLE TIME TO COMPLETE THE HEAD AS HER FANCY DICTATED AND SHE REALIZED THAT A GOOD SERVANT'S HEAD MUST BE PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED
YOOP WAS SO TALL THAT OUR FRIENDS HAD TO TIP THEIR HEADS WAY BACK TO LOOK INTO HIS FACE AND THEY NOTICED HE WAS DRESSED ALL IN PINK VELVET WITH SILVER BUTTONS AND BRAID
MOST AS MUCH AS I DO I GUESS WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ANYTHING ASKED BUNGLE
THE LAST THING IS THE EASIEST OF ALL TO GET AND I'M SURE THAT MY DEAR UNC NUNKIE--AND GOOD MARGOLOTTE AS WELL--WILL SOON BE RESTORED TO LIFE THE MUNCHKIN BOY SAID THIS WITH MUCH PRIDE AND PLEASURE
WE WON'T NEED TO TAKE THE WOOZY EITHER BUT HE OUGHT TO BE SAVED BECAUSE OF THE THREE HAIRS IN HIS TAIL BETTER TAKE ME ALONG SAID THE WOOZY
HIS FAULT WAS MORE THOUGHTLESS THAN WICKED BUT THAT DID NOT ALTER THE FACT THAT HE HAD COMMITTED A FAULT
THE SCARECROW WHO IS A GENTLEMAN OF GREAT WISDOM THINKS I'M BEAUTIFUL RETORTED SCRAPS
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX THE TRICK RIVER NEXT MORNING THEY PUSHED THE RAFT INTO THE WATER AND ALL GOT ABOARD
IT IS CALLED MY LULU THEN THE PHONOGRAPH BEGAN TO PLAY
BRAIN FURNITURE AND THE BOTTLES ON THIS SHELF WERE LABELED AS FOLLOWS
ALLOW ME MISS PATCHWORK SAID THE SHAGGY MAN TO PRESENT MY FRIEND THE RIGHT ROYAL SCARECROW OF OZ
THAT'S GOING TO BE A TER'BLE HARD CLIMB SCARECROW
BUT HE WAS A CHEERFUL MAN AND HIS FACE BORE A PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE EXPRESSION
NOR A RAFT WHERE DOES THIS RIVER GO TO ASKED DOROTHY
BUT I IMAGINE YOU'LL HAVE A HARD JOB GETTING A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY
IT WAS A BIG HOUSE ROUND AS WERE ALL THE MUNCHKIN HOUSES AND PAINTED BLUE WHICH IS THE DISTINCTIVE COLOR OF THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY OF OZ
AS THEY GAZED UPWARD AT THE GREAT MASS OF TUMBLED ROCKS THAT COVERED THE STEEP INCLINE DOROTHY GAVE A LITTLE GROAN AND SAID
THE CHANGEFUL COLORING OF THE GREAT LEAVES WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS BEWILDERING AS WELL AND THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE DREW OUR TRAVELERS CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLANTS WHERE THEY STOOD WATCHING THEM WITH RAPT INTEREST
OZMA KNOWS MANY THINGS SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
WHEN DARKNESS CAME ON AND THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE ON THE CABIN FLOOR FACING THE FIRELIGHT--THERE BEING NO FURNITURE OF ANY SORT IN THE PLACE--OJO SAID TO THE SHAGGY MAN
AS THE CURRENT REVERSED AND RUSHED BACKWARD ON ITS COURSE IT FAILED TO DRAG THE RAFT WITH IT
NOR COULD THEY SEE FAR IN FRONT OF THEM BECAUSE THE PATH WAS SO CROOKED
DID YOU CALL ME SCRAPS
WE WILL PASSICAL THE CLASSICAL AND PRESERVE WHAT JOY WE HAVE LEFT
WHAT IS IT ASKED DOROTHY STANDING ON TIP-TOES TO LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER
THEN UP HE JUMPED AND RAN OVER TO CHISS PUTTING HIS FOOT ON THE MONSTER'S NECK AND HOLDING IT A PRISONER
BEFORE IT WAS A GARDEN FILLED WITH BLOOMING FLOWERS
I'VE BEEN A ROVER ALL MY LIFE AND ALTHOUGH OZMA HAS GIVEN ME A SUITE OF BEAUTIFUL ROOMS IN HER PALACE I STILL GET THE WANDERING FEVER ONCE IN A WHILE AND START OUT TO ROAM THE COUNTRY OVER
BUT YOU CAN'T PASS THROUGH JUST NOW BECAUSE WE ARE AT WAR WITH THE HORNERS THAT'S TOO BAD SAID THE SCARECROW
YOU SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
OH LET ME SEE UNC NUNKIE
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SHE CLEARED THE TABLE AND THEN READ TO HIM A STORY FROM ONE OF THE BOOKS
THE TRICK RIVER KEEPS CHANGING IT SEEMS AND HERE WE MUST FLOAT BACK AND FORWARD FOREVER UNLESS WE MANAGE IN SOME WAY TO GET ASHORE CAN YOU SWIM ASKED DOROTHY
IT'S LOVELY
LIE DOWN AND KEEP QUIET WHISPERED THE CAT WARNINGLY
I'LL HELP AND YOU CAN DO MOST OF THE WORK
NOW THEN--LOOK OUT THE WOOZY TURNED TOWARD CHISS OPENED WIDE ITS MOUTH AND SAID
AREN'T YOU HORRID HORRID SHE REPLIED
WHY SHE'S GONE GASPED OJO IN AMAZEMENT AND LISTENING CAREFULLY HE THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR THE MUFFLED SCREAMS OF SCRAPS COMING FROM THE CENTER OF THE FOLDED LEAF
HE IS NOW SMALL BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG
THEN SHE SAID GENTLY
PRESENTLY THEY CAME UPON ANOTHER SIGN WHICH READ
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYHOW I'VE RUN AWAY SAID THE MUSIC THING
HAVEN'T YOU ANY FUN IN YOU AT ALL IF I HAD SUCH A QUALITY REPLIED THE SCARECROW YOUR PEOPLE WOULD HAVE KNOCKED IT OUT OF ME
ON THE CONTRARY SHE SMILED A LITTLE AT HER THOUGHTS AND THEN GREW SOBER AGAIN
THE SHAGGY MAN STARING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED AND INTERESTED
EVERYONE SEEMS TO HATE ME AND YET I WAS INTENDED TO AMUSE PEOPLE IT ISN'T YOU WE HATE ESPECIALLY OBSERVED THE GLASS CAT
ON A SHELF OVER THE WINDOW SAT A GREAT BLUE OWL WITH A BLUE SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD BLINKING HER BIG ROUND EYES AT THE VISITORS
AH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT SAID SHE
WHY YES
MINE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD
IT'S FUN MAINTAINED THE WOOZY
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN OJO IS FORGIVEN THE NEXT MORNING THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS WENT TO THE PRISON AND TOOK OJO AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE HE WAS SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GIRL RULER FOR JUDGMENT
BUT THE SAWHORSE MUST HAVE MADE HIS LEGS TWINKLE TO HAVE CARRIED YOU SO FAR IN ONE DAY
SCRAPS WAS QUITE NEW AND NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW ANYTHING OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE THE GLASS CAT ADMITTED SHE HAD NEVER WANDERED VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE MAGICIAN'S HOUSE
IT FILLS ME WITH A CRUNKLING JOY A STRAW-STACK TO BEHOLD FOR THEN I PAD THIS LUCKY BOY WITH STRANDS OF YELLOW GOLD AH EXCLAIMED THE SHAGGY MAN
TAKE OFF THOSE HANDCUFFS SOLDIER FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HOUSE I KNOW THAT VERY WELL REPLIED THE SOLDIER AND AT ONCE UNLOCKED THE HANDCUFFS AND RELEASED THE PRISONER
MAKES A PAINT-BOX BLUSH WITH SHAME
HE THEN STOOD CLOSE TO THE FENCE WITH HIS HEAD NEAR ONE OF THE BOARDS AND SCRAPS CALLED OUT KRIZZLE-KROO THEN OJO SAID KRIZZLE-KROO AND THE GLASS CAT SAID KRIZZLE-KROO THE WOOZY BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH ANGER AND SMALL SPARKS DARTED FROM HIS EYES
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND BEASTS HE SAID I BEG TO ANNOUNCE THAT OUR GRACIOUS RULER HAS PERMITTED ME TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF THE GREAT SORCERESS GLINDA THE GOOD WHOSE HUMBLE ASSISTANT I AM PROUD TO BE
IT IS QUITE REAL WHILE YOU HAVE YOUR EYES OPEN BUT IF YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE BARRIER DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL
IT SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH MANY ADVENTURES SINCE OJO AND HIS COMRADES LAST SAW THE MACHINE FOR THE VARNISH OF ITS WOODEN CASE WAS ALL MARRED AND DENTED AND SCRATCHED IN A WAY THAT GAVE IT AN AGED AND DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE
NOTHING AT ALL
BUT I CANNOT FLASH FIRE FROM MY EYES UNLESS I AM VERY ANGRY CAN'T YOU GET ANGRY BOUT SOMETHING PLEASE ASKED OJO
HOW IS IT SAWHORSE
HE HASN'T GOT IT SO I DEMAND THAT YOU SET THIS POOR MUNCHKIN BOY FREE THE PEOPLE OF OZ LISTENED TO THIS DEFIANCE IN AMAZEMENT AND WONDERED AT THE QUEER PATCHWORK GIRL WHO DARED TALK SO BOLDLY TO THEIR RULER
IF WE GET TOO NEAR HE'LL FIRE THOSE QUILLS AT US AND HURT US BADLY THEN WE WILL BE FOOLISH TO GET TOO NEAR SAID SCRAPS
HOW SHALL WE GET OVER THE FENCE CLIMB ANSWERED SCRAPS AND AT ONCE SHE BEGAN CLIMBING UP THE ROWS OF BARS
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO PICK A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER
PERHAPS YOU'VE NOTICED MY DIFFERENT COLORS
CHAMPION WRESTLER
JUST THE SAME YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AWAY SAID OJO
UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE STOOD BEHIND NEAR THE WINDOWS OJO AT ONE SIDE AND THE MAGICIAN IN FRONT WHERE HE WOULD HAVE FREEDOM TO SPRINKLE THE POWDER
AND SO WE ARE KIND TO OUR PRISONERS OJO THOUGHT THIS OVER VERY CAREFULLY
THAT CROOKED MAGICIAN IS BREAKING THE LAW BY PRACTICING MAGIC WITHOUT A LICENSE AND I'M NOT SURE OZMA WILL ALLOW HIM TO RESTORE YOUR UNCLE TO LIFE ALREADY I HAVE WARNED THE BOY OF THAT DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN
EVEN THE RAINBOW HASN'T AS MANY COLORS AND YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THE RAINBOW IS A PRETTY THING THE GLASS CAT YAWNED AND STRETCHED HERSELF UPON THE FLOOR
BUT A SQUARE WOOZY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING CROOKED IF HE WANTED TO I AM NEITHER SQUARE NOR CROOKED SAID SCRAPS LOOKING DOWN AT HER PLUMP BODY
ALL I'VE EVER SEEN OF THE GREAT LAND OF OZ UNC DEAR IS THE VIEW OF THAT MOUNTAIN OVER AT THE SOUTH WHERE THEY SAY THE HAMMERHEADS LIVE--WHO WON'T LET ANYBODY GO BY THEM--AND THAT MOUNTAIN AT THE NORTH WHERE THEY SAY NOBODY LIVES ONE DECLARED UNC CORRECTING HIM
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT SHE LED THE WAY TO A GREAT DOMED HALL AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE MAGICIAN'S WORKSHOP
THE VELVET BREECHES HAD JEWELED BUCKLES AT THE KNEES AND SHAGS ALL AROUND THE BOTTOMS
SIT DOWN AND MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE UNC NUNKIE AND AFTER I'VE FINISHED MY TASK I WILL TALK TO YOU YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW-SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE PASSING WAS STILL ROCKY AND DESERTED WITH HERE AND THERE A BUSH OR A TREE TO BREAK THE DREARY LANDSCAPE
BUT ALL OUR TROUBLES ARE OVER FOR THE PRESENT AS ANOTHER DAY'S JOURNEY WILL BRING US TO THE GREAT EMERALD CITY THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO KNOW THIS AND PROCEEDED WITH NEW COURAGE
A STRAIN OF ODD JERKY SOUNDS WAS FOLLOWED BY THESE WORDS SUNG BY A MAN THROUGH HIS NOSE WITH GREAT VIGOR OF EXPRESSION
OH SO YOU'VE FOUND IT
I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO SCOLD THE FELLOW FOR I CAN'T BE DROPPING OIL WHEREVER I GO NEVER MIND SAID DOROTHY
HE GLANCED AHEAD AND SAW THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WAS LOOKING BACK
NO SAID OJO
WELL REPLIED THE MAN IF I'M CAPTURED I MUST SURRENDER FOR IT'S THE PROPER THING TO DO
A DARK WELL CAN ONLY BE DISCOVERED IN SOME OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE AND THERE MAY BE DANGERS THERE YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY DOROTHY SAID OZMA
YOU ARE FORGIVEN SHE SAID
A PINK KITTEN
BUT--GOODNESS ME!--THE QUADLING COUNTRY IS FULL OF DANGERS DECLARED JACK
WELL SOMETIMES IT IS AND SOMETIMES IT ISN'T REPLIED THE HORNER AFTER CONSIDERING THE QUESTION
HE PULLED HARDER
PLEASE NOTICE THAT MY BODY HAS NO COLOR AT ALL
I'M SOMETHING OF A SINGER MYSELF AND I DON'T INTEND TO BE THROTTLED BY ANY LULUS LIKE YOUR COAL-BLACK ONE
WHAT HARM COULD THERE BE IN PICKING IT
SO THEY LEFT THE MAN SNUGGLING DOWN TO SLEEP IN HIS DUSKY DWELLING AND WENT OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE TAKING THE PATH THAT LED TOWARD THE ROCKY PLACES
BUT THE BOY WHO THEN OWNED HIM HAD WHITTLED TWO EARS OUT OF BARK AND STUCK THEM IN THE HEAD AFTER WHICH THE SAWHORSE HEARD VERY DISTINCTLY
HOW DID YOU GET IN ASKED THE WOOZY
AN HOUR AGO I WAS CALLED TO THE PRESENCE OF HER HIGHNESS OZMA OF OZ AND TOLD TO ARREST A BOY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY WHO WAS JOURNEYING FROM THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY TO THE EMERALD CITY AND WOULD ARRIVE IN A SHORT TIME
BECAUSE IT IS LADYLIKE AND PROPER REPLIED THE CHIEF
THE PATCHWORK GIRL 4
THEY SEEM FAST ENOUGH WHEN YOU RUN HE REPLIED
SO I CUT UP THE QUILT CONTINUED MARGOLOTTE AND MADE FROM IT A VERY WELL-SHAPED GIRL WHICH I STUFFED WITH COTTON-WADDING
SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
A WOMAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SEEING OJO IN HIS WHITE ROBE EXCLAIMED
BUT THEY ALL MANAGED TO GET UP IN SAFETY AND THE MUNCHKIN BOY WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN HE STOOD IN THE HORNER CITY AND REALIZED THAT THE WATER FROM THE DARK WELL WHICH HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD TRAVELED SO FAR TO SECURE WAS SAFE IN HIS JACKET POCKET
THINK I'LL INDULGE IN ONE NOW AS LONG AS WE'RE STOPPING ANYWAY SAYING THIS HE TOOK A BOTTLE FROM HIS POCKET AND SHOOK FROM IT A TABLET ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE OF OJO'S FINGER-NAILS
MARGOLOTTE HAD PUZZLED OVER THE EARS FOR SOME TIME FOR THESE WERE IMPORTANT IF THE SERVANT WAS TO HEAR DISTINCTLY BUT FINALLY SHE HAD MADE THEM OUT OF THIN PLATES OF GOLD AND ATTACHED THEM IN PLACE BY MEANS OF STITCHES THROUGH TINY HOLES BORED IN THE METAL
NOT THAT THE TREES AND GRASSES WERE RED BUT THE FENCES AND HOUSES WERE PAINTED THAT COLOR AND ALL THE WILD-FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED BY THE WAYSIDE HAD RED BLOSSOMS
MISTER YOOP IS A PERFECT STRANGER TO ME BUT I FEAR FROM THE RUDE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS ACTED THAT HE IS NO GENTLEMAN DOROTHY AND OJO LAUGHED AT THIS STATEMENT AND TOTO BARKED AS IF HE UNDERSTOOD THE JOKE AFTER WHICH THEY ALL FELT BETTER AND RESUMED THE JOURNEY IN HIGH SPIRITS
I CAN SEE THAT SAID THE BOY NODDING
A LITTLE CLEVERNESS
BUT SAID HE IN A PUZZLED WAY WHAT MAKES THOSE THREE HAIRS IMPORTANT
HE WAS DREADFULLY TIRED OF LIVING ALL ALONE IN THE WOODS AND WANTED TO TRAVEL AND SEE PEOPLE
THAT IS STRANGE MY FRIEND WASN'T ALWAYS TIN SAID THE MAN BUT HE WAS CARELESS WITH HIS AXE AND USED TO CHOP HIMSELF VERY BADLY
PLEASE DON'T ANSWERED OJO HIS VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE
FOR IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A MUSIC-MAKER CAN LAST LONG IN THE LAND OF OZ
I GUESS THEY'LL BE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN THEY FIND HE'S ESCAPED SO THEY WILL DECLARED THE WOOZY CHUCKLING GLEEFULLY
I ADVISE YOU TO GO HOME AND BEG THE MAGICIAN'S PARDON NEVER
ISN'T ANY BUTTER
IN AN INSTANT OJO NOTICED THEY WERE GAINING GROUND AND AS THEY PROCEEDED IN THIS CURIOUS WAY THEY SOON PASSED THE TREE WHICH HAD FIRST ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION TO THEIR DIFFICULTY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DARK WELL
BUT DR PIPT DOES NOT KNOW ITS TRUE VALUE AND HE USES IT IN THE MOST FOOLISH WAYS I MUST SEE ABOUT THAT SAID OZMA GRAVELY
TIN FOUNTAINS SENT SPRAYS OF CLEAR WATER FAR INTO THE AIR AND THERE WERE MANY BEDS OF TIN FLOWERS ALL AS PERFECTLY FORMED AS ANY NATURAL FLOWERS MIGHT BE
SO THE BOY OPENED HIS BASKET AND BROKE A PIECE OFF THE LOAF OF BREAD
LET'S GO IN SCARECROW
I CAN SEE DECLARED THE GLASS CAT
IN MY TIME I'VE PERFORMED SOME MAGICAL FEATS THAT WERE WORTHY OF THE SKILL OF GLINDA THE GOOD
THEY ARE JUST MONSTROUS PLANTS THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY WERE
IF YOU'LL KINDLY PINCH ME I'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT IT YOU'RE AWAKE SAID DOROTHY AND THIS IS NO MAGICIAN BUT JUST THE SCARECROW BUT HE'S ALIVE PROTESTED THE MAN AND HE OUGHTN'T TO BE YOU KNOW
THAT IS WHY AFTER TWO LONG YEARS OF WAITING ANOTHER OZ STORY IS NOW PRESENTED TO THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA
THEN HE HANDED IT TO OJO
LET EM ALL COME UP REPLIED DOROTHY
AND THE SCARECROW AND THE PATCHWORK GIRL SAT LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND TALKED IN WHISPERS ALL NIGHT LONG
HE PULLED OFF THE COVER GLANCED WITHIN AND THEN THREW THE BOTTLE FROM HIM WITH A WAIL OF DESPAIR
SCRAPS--SCARECROW THEY BOTH BOWED WITH MUCH DIGNITY
IT IS HARD TO FACE ANY SAVAGE BEAST WITHOUT A SINKING OF THE HEART BUT STILL MORE TERRIFYING IS IT TO FACE AN UNKNOWN BEAST WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN EVEN A PICTURE OF
THAT'S TOO BAD UNC
I EXPECT I SHALL SEE YOU A GOOD MANY TIMES AS YOU GO BY UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO SWIM ASHORE BY THAT TIME THEY HAD LEFT HIM BEHIND AND WERE HEADED ONCE MORE STRAIGHT TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY
IT'S EXTREMELY BAD MUFFLED AS IT WAS THE PHONOGRAPH PLAYED ON
THAT SAID DR PIPT IN A PLEASED AND TRIUMPHANT TONE IS THE WONDERFUL POWDER OF LIFE WHICH I ALONE IN THE WORLD KNOW HOW TO MAKE
MY DOG HAS CAPTURED YOU SHE SAID
THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL THE WIZARD SHOOK HIS HEAD
THEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY LIFTED UNTIL HE WAS SWAYING IN THE AIR WITH THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF HUGGING HIM ON ALL SIDES
THE GLASS CAT WAS SO PROUD OF HER PINK BRAINS THAT SHE VENTURED TO COME CLOSE TO DOROTHY IN ORDER THAT THE GIRL MIGHT SEE EM WORK THIS WAS REALLY INTERESTING BUT WHEN DOROTHY PATTED THE CAT SHE FOUND THE GLASS COLD AND HARD AND UNRESPONSIVE SO SHE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT BUNGLE WOULD NEVER DO FOR A PET
CHAPTER TWENTY THE CAPTIVE YOOP AS THEY WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE DOROTHY ASKED
I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT GUARDIAN
IF SUCH A THING IS ANYWHERE IN THE SETTLED PARTS OF OZ SAID DOROTHY WE'D PROB'LY HAVE HEARD OF IT LONG AGO
WHAT IS CHISS
IN A FEW MOMENTS THE BOARD HAD BURNED TO A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL FEET LEAVING AN OPENING BIG ENOUGH FOR THEM ALL TO PASS THROUGH
THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE I COULD HAVE COME FROM SHE REPLIED
AND NOW OUR RARE MUSEUM WILL INCLUDE A CAT OF GLASS A WOOZY AND--LAST BUT NOT LEAST--A CRAZY PATCHWORK LASS OJO WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS SONG THAT HE APPLAUDED THE SINGER BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND SCRAPS FOLLOWED SUIT BY CLAPPING HER PADDED FINGERS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THEY MADE NO NOISE
WHEN THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE CURRENT HAD BEFORE CHANGED THE FISH WAS STILL SWIMMING AHEAD IN ITS WILD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
THE GLASS CAT CAME NEAR TOO CURIOUS TO WATCH THE IMPORTANT SCENE
WHY I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT HE JOYFULLY CRIED AND GRABBED UP THE GOLDEN BOTTLE WITH WHICH HE RAN TO MARGOLOTTE
I KNOW SHE RETURNED
THE MINUTES PASSED AND BECAME HOURS
HE OFFERED A PORTION OF THE FOOD TO THE SHAGGY MAN WHO THANKED HIM BUT REFUSED IT
OJO HAD LAGGED BEHIND FOR IN SPITE OF THE WARNINGS HE HAD RECEIVED THE BOY'S EYES WERE FASTENED ON THE CLOVER THAT BORDERED THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS AND HE WAS EAGER TO DISCOVER IF SUCH A THING AS A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER REALLY EXISTED
THE HORNS DID NOT SEEM VERY TERRIBLE FOR THEY WERE NOT MORE THAN SIX INCHES LONG
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW SAID HE
BUT A LITTLE MISERY AT TIMES MAKES ONE APPRECIATE HAPPINESS MORE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE ONE MAY BE FOUND INQUIRED THE SHAGGY MAN
THE GLASS CAT BEING SMALL CREPT BETWEEN THE LOWER BARS AND JOINED THEM
WE MUST BE BETTER ACQUAINTED FOR NEVER BEFORE HAVE I MET A GIRL WITH SUCH EXQUISITE COLORING OR SUCH NATURAL ARTLESS MANNERS NO WONDER THEY CALL YOU THE WISE SCARECROW REPLIED SCRAPS
BUT OJO SAID
HERE'S A JOB FOR A BOY OF BRAINS
IT SAYS
AS SHE DID SO THE TOP FLEW OPEN AND OUT POPPED A DUSKY CREATURE RISING ITS LENGTH INTO THE AIR AND THEN PLUMPING DOWN UPON THE GROUND JUST BESIDE THE LITTLE GIRL
I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE YOU KNOW AND CAN'T STAND MANY HARD KNOCKS IF ANYTHING SHOULD FADE THE COLORS OF MY LOVELY PATCHES IT WOULD BREAK MY HEART SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
THE NECK WAS A SHARPENED STICK ON WHICH THE PUMPKIN HEAD WAS SET AND THE EYES EARS NOSE AND MOUTH WERE CARVED ON THE SKIN OF THE PUMPKIN VERY LIKE A CHILD'S JACK-O'-LANTERN
THERE'S YOUR RECEIPT SOLDIER
I'VE TAKEN A FANCY TO HER
SCRAPS TRIED THAT
OF COURSE
OF COURSE
THE WOOZY ATE THAT TOO AND SMACKED ITS LONG THIN LIPS
ROAD BEYOND HERE IS PRETTY BAD
IF THE PINK KITTEN DESPISES YOU LOOK OUT FOR BREAKERS WOULD ANYONE AT THE ROYAL PALACE BREAK A GLASS CAT MIGHT
IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THEM WHERE THE WALL CROSSED THE ROADWAY STOOD A GATE HAVING STOUT IRON BARS THAT EXTENDED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I WOULD FAIL IN ANYTHING I TRIED TO DO WHY ARE YOU OJO THE UNLUCKY ASKED THE TIN MAN
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE SPACIOUS GROUNDS OUR TRAVELERS FOUND MORE TO ADMIRE
HE SCRAMBLED QUICKLY TO HIS FEET AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM--A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES
YOU'RE A REGULAR COMFORTER AND AS SWEET AS PATCHWORK CAN BE
AND THE WOOZY WAS THERE SITTING ON ITS SQUARE HIND LEGS AND LOOKING ON THE SCENE WITH SOLEMN INTEREST
THIS TABLE LOOKS TO YOU LIKE WOOD AND ONCE IT REALLY WAS WOOD
THE EMERALD CITY LIES DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THESE FOUR IMPORTANT COUNTRIES OF OZ
I LIFT OFF MY OLD HEAD PLACE IT ON A TABLE BEFORE ME AND USE THE FACE FOR A PATTERN TO GO BY
LISTEN TO MY PARTNER AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG SAID THE OWL IN A GRUMBLING VOICE
UNC NUNKIE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN KING OF THE MUNCHKINS HAD NOT HIS PEOPLE UNITED WITH ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF OZ IN ACKNOWLEDGING OZMA AS THEIR SOLE RULER HAD RETIRED INTO THIS FORGOTTEN FOREST NOOK WITH HIS BABY NEPHEW AND THEY HAD LIVED ALL ALONE THERE
THE WOOZY HAS PROVED HIMSELF A GOOD WOOZY AND A FAITHFUL FRIEND THE WIZARD WENT ON SO WE WILL SEND HIM TO THE ROYAL MENAGERIE WHERE HE WILL HAVE GOOD CARE AND PLENTY TO EAT ALL HIS LIFE MUCH OBLIGED SAID THE WOOZY
THE TAIL WAS SQUARE AND STUBBY AND PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AND THE FOUR LEGS WERE MADE IN THE SAME WAY EACH BEING FOUR-SIDED
ARE YOU GLASS OR WHAT I'M GLASS AND TRANSPARENT TOO WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID OF SOME FOLKS ANSWERED THE CAT
SOME ONE IS ALMOST SURE TO GET HURT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT MADAM INQUIRED THE SCARECROW
OH THEN THEY'RE UNICORNS DECLARED THE SCARECROW
I'LL BE THERE THIS EVENING FOR I'M ANXIOUS TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH MISS SCRAPS
WE HORNERS SPEND ALL OUR TIME DIGGING RADIUM FROM THE MINES UNDER THIS MOUNTAIN AND WE USE IT TO DECORATE OUR HOMES AND MAKE THEM PRETTY AND COSY
IF IT WERE A RUBY WHICH IS THE COLOR I LIKE BEST I MIGHT WORK A LITTLE WHILE I'VE GOT SOME SQUARE MEAL TABLETS SAID THE SCARECROW
MARGOLOTTE WANTED A SLAVE SO SHE MADE ME OUT OF AN OLD BED-QUILT SHE DIDN'T USE
SO LET US SIT DOWN COSILY AND ENJOY OURSELVES
BECAUSE I WAS BORN ON A FRIDAY FRIDAY IS NOT UNLUCKY DECLARED THE EMPEROR
VERY WELL SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL I'M GOING TO SERVE YOU AND YOUR WIFE BY HELPING OJO FIND THE THINGS YOU NEED
ALL READY
SOME OTHERS ARE ACCUSED OF BEING CROOKED BUT I AM THE ONLY GENUINE HE WAS REALLY VERY CROOKED AND OJO WONDERED HOW HE MANAGED TO DO SO MANY THINGS WITH SUCH A TWISTED BODY
I'LL GET A CHANCE TO SEE THE COUNTRY YOU'RE CRAZY GIRL
DIKSEY HORNER
WHEN SHE SAYS THOSE THINGS I'M SURE HER BRAINS GET MIXED SOMEHOW AND WORK THE WRONG WAY
THE NEXT THING CONTINUED THE MAGICIAN IS THE LEFT WING OF A YELLOW BUTTERFLY
ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE-TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
MARGOLOTTE AND UNC NUNKIE ARE PERFECT STRANGERS TO ME FOR THE MOMENT I CAME TO LIFE THEY CAME TO MARBLE I SEE REMARKED DOROTHY WITH A SIGH OF REGRET
THEY HAVE AN IDEA THAT WHAT IS NOT SEEN BY OTHERS IS NOT IMPORTANT BUT WITH US THE ROOMS WE LIVE IN ARE OUR CHIEF DELIGHT AND CARE AND WE PAY NO ATTENTION TO OUTSIDE SHOW SEEMS TO ME SAID SCRAPS MUSINGLY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE IT ALL PRETTY--INSIDE AND OUT SEEMS
AND YET I SLEPT VERY WELL AND AREN'T YOU HUNGRY IT'S STRANGE REPLIED OJO
FOR ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE COMMITTED A SERIOUS FAULT YOU ARE NOW PENITENT AND I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH
FOR SUPPER THE SHAGGY MAN ATE ONE OF HIS TABLETS BUT OJO STUCK TO HIS BREAD AND CHEESE AS THE MOST SATISFYING FOOD
BUT DON'T BE DISCOURAGED YET
I'VE GOT SOME BREAD AND CHEESE IN MY BASKET
IF ON OUR RETURN I FAIL TO TAKE THESE THREE HAIRS TO THE CROOKED MAGICIAN THE OTHER THINGS I HAVE COME TO SEEK WILL BE OF NO USE AT ALL AND WE CANNOT RESTORE UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE TO LIFE THEY'RE GONERS I GUESS SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BE QUIET AND LET ME THINK
GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
IT'S HARD TO NAME ALL OF THE FREAKS THIS NOBLE LAND'S ACQUIRED
THEN IT WOULD BREAK MY COTTON PERSISTED SCRAPS
THE GIANT'S BOOTS WERE OF PINK LEATHER AND HAD TASSELS ON THEM AND HIS HAT WAS DECORATED WITH AN ENORMOUS PINK OSTRICH FEATHER CAREFULLY CURLED
THEN HE TURNED TO STARE AT THE PATCHWORK GIRL IN WONDER WHILE SHE IN TURN STARED AT HIM
THERE'S A VERY DARK WELL DOWN IN MY RADIUM MINE IS THERE ANY WATER IN IT OJO EAGERLY ASKED
THAT IS TOO BAD REMARKED OJO
TERRIBLY ANGRY WHAT DOES IT MEAN ASKED SCRAPS
HOWDY-DO MISS WHAT'S-YOUR-NAME SHE BOWED AND THE REFLECTION BOWED
AND NOW WE'RE HERE IT'S RATHER QUEER THERE'S NO FRONT DOOR THAT CAN BE KNOCKED PLEASE DON'T SCRAPS SAID OJO
AS IT WAS NEARLY TIME FOR DOROTHY TO DINE WITH OZMA WHICH SHE DID EVERY EVENING SHE RANG FOR A SERVANT AND ORDERED THE WOOZY TAKEN TO A NICE ROOM AND GIVEN PLENTY OF SUCH FOOD AS HE LIKED BEST
WAIT A MINUTE CRIED SCRAPS
A COAT WITH SHAGGY EDGES WAS DECORATED WITH DIAMOND BUTTONS
HE SELECTED A COSTUME OF PEA-GREEN AND PINK SATIN AND VELVET WITH EMBROIDERED SHAGS ON ALL THE EDGES AND IRIDESCENT PEARLS FOR ORNAMENTS
DON'T QUARREL PLEASE PLEADED THE BOY RISING TO RESUME THE JOURNEY
OUR LEGS ARE UNDER US WHETHER ONE OR TWO AND WE STAND ON THEM
BUT I'M TIRED PLAYING THAT TUNE CALLED THE PHONOGRAPH SPEAKING THROUGH ITS HORN IN A BRAZEN SCRATCHY VOICE
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE SO I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT REPLIED THE MAGICIAN
ALSO I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP THE BOY FOR YOUR HEAD SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOME THOUGHTS I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND IN IT
BY THE WAY MARGOLOTTE I THOUGHT I SAW YOU GETTING SOME BRAINS FROM THE CUPBOARD WHILE I WAS BUSY WITH MY KETTLES
IT'S THE PATCHWORK GIRL
LOOK OUT FOR YOOP THE GIRL EYED THIS SIGN A MOMENT AND TURNED TO THE SCARECROW ASKING
IT IS PLEASANT TO REFLECT THAT THE FIRST SOUNDS HER GOLDEN EARS WILL HEAR WILL BE DELICIOUS MUSIC AS HE SPOKE HE WENT TO A PHONOGRAPH WHICH SCREWED FAST TO A SMALL TABLE AND WOUND UP THE SPRING OF THE INSTRUMENT AND ADJUSTED THE BIG GOLD HORN
FOR THE COWARDLY LION AND THE HUNGRY TIGER WERE WELL KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN THE EMERALD CITY AND THEY ALWAYS GUARDED THE RULER WHEN SHE HELD HIGH COURT IN THE THRONE ROOM
THE LAST PLANT OF ALL THE ROW HAD CAPTURED THE WOOZY AND A BIG BUNCH IN THE CENTER OF THE CURLED LEAF SHOWED PLAINLY WHERE HE WAS
OZMA GAVE THE MUNCHKIN BOY A ROOM IN THE PALACE FOR THAT NIGHT AND THE AFTERNOON HE PASSED WITH DOROTHY--GETTING ACQUAINTED AS SHE SAID--AND RECEIVING ADVICE FROM THE SHAGGY MAN AS TO WHERE THEY MUST GO
AT THE WONDERFUL EMERALD CITY WHICH HE WOULD PRESENTLY REACH WERE SO MANY STRANGE AND CURIOUS PEOPLE THAT HE WAS HALF AFRAID OF MEETING THEM AND WONDERED IF THEY WOULD PROVE FRIENDLY AND KIND
BUT YOUR FEROCIOUS GROWL ISN'T AS LOUD AS THE TICK OF A BEETLE--OR ONE OF OJO'S SNORES WHEN HE'S FAST ASLEEP PERHAPS SAID THE WOOZY HUMBLY I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ABOUT MY GROWL
WE MAY BEWARE BUT WE DON'T CARE AND DARE GO WHERE WE SCARE THE YOOP DEAR ME
HERE MR CHAMPION
SHAKE HANDS MY LITTLE MAN
THE SCARECROW LOOKED GRAVE AS HE LISTENED AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES AS IF IN DISAPPROVAL
IT TURNED OUT ABOUT THE WAY THE SCARECROW HAD PLANNED
SHE TOLD HIM NOT TO HE ONLY PRACTICES MAGIC FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN FAMILY EXPLAINED BUNGLE WHO WAS KEEPING AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE LITTLE BLACK DOG
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE MYSELF BUT I HAVE SAID THE SCARECROW
HEE HEE HEE
WAIT A MOMENT REPLIED OZMA FOR I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY
GONE--GONE
YOU MISJUDGE MY ANCESTRY
WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAS BEEN INDULGING IN HIS MAGICAL ARTS CONTRARY TO LAW AND THEREFORE BY ROYAL EDICT I HEREBY DEPRIVE HIM OF ALL POWER TO WORK MAGIC IN THE FUTURE
BUT I SEE NO HARM IN ALLOWING HER TO LISTEN TO THIS UNSEEN BAND WHILE SHE WAKENS TO HER FIRST REALIZATION OF LIFE
I NEVER EAT YOU KNOW BEING STRAW
SHE WILL HAVE TO WORK WHEN SHE COMES TO LIFE SAID MARGOLOTTE
I'M OJO THE UNLUCKY AND SOMETHING DREADFUL WAS SURE TO HAPPEN TO ME HE PUSHED AGAINST THE LEAF THAT HELD HIM AND FOUND IT TO BE SOFT BUT THICK AND FIRM
THEY WROTE MANY LETTERS ASKING IF THE HISTORIAN DID NOT KNOW OF SOME ADVENTURES TO WRITE ABOUT THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE LAND OF OZ WAS SHUT OUT FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD
OJO WAS BY NATURE GENTLE AND AFFECTIONATE AND IF HE HAD DISOBEYED THE LAW OF OZ IT WAS TO RESTORE HIS DEAR UNC NUNKIE TO LIFE
YOU HAVE KIND INSTINCTS HE SAID AND WITH A HEART YOU WOULD INDEED BE A FINE CREATURE
IT IS PLAIN TO ME THAT YOU ARE A REMARKABLE GROUP--AS REMARKABLE IN YOUR WAY AS I AM IN MINE--AND SO YOU ARE WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN
BUT PERHAPS I WHO AM BIG AND STRONG CAN PULL THOSE THREE HAIRS FROM THE WOOZY'S TAIL TRY IT IF YOU LIKE SAID THE WOOZY
THE CHARM YOU NEED IS A NEEDLE AND THREAD SAID THE SHAGGY MAN
I S'POSE IT'S BECAUSE I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY THAT EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP ME GETS INTO TROUBLE YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE ANYONE TO HELP YOU DECLARED DOROTHY
YOU HAVE ANNOYED TRAVELERS ON THIS ROAD LONG ENOUGH AND NOW I SHALL PUT AN END TO YOU YOU CAN'T RETURNED CHISS
THE WATER MUST BE PUT IN A GOLD BOTTLE AND BROUGHT TO ME WITHOUT ANY LIGHT EVER REACHING IT I'LL GET THE WATER FROM THE DARK WELL SAID OJO
NO ONE COULD TRUST THAT CROOKED MAGICIAN FOR INSTANCE JUST BECAUSE HE IS CROOKED
BUT THE SCENE AWED THE BOY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE WITH FEAR
OH YES SAID DIKSEY WHO OVERHEARD THE BOY'S QUESTION
HOW DO YOU DO
THE SAWHORSE IS A SPLENDID STEED AND THOUGH HE'S MADE OF WOOD HE DOES AS MANY THRILLING STUNTS AS ANY MEAT HORSE COULD
A MEASURE HOW BIG A MEASURE WELL I'LL ASK DOROTHY SO NEXT MORNING THEY ASKED DOROTHY AND SHE SAID
NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT OJO DID NOT REPLY BUT HE WAS SO DEJECTED THAT EVEN THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE EMERALD CITY FAILED TO INTEREST HIM
BEHIND THESE COURTIERS WERE OTHERS OF LESS IMPORTANCE FILLING THE GREAT HALL TO THE VERY DOORS
WHEN THE MIXTURE WAS COMPLETE THERE WAS SCARCELY A HANDFUL ALL TOLD
THIS MUST BE THE ROAD TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOPPERS SAID THE SCARECROW
THE WIZARD NOW AROSE AND MADE A LOW BOW TO OZMA AND ANOTHER LESS DEFERENT BOW TO THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY
I USED TO KNOW HER THERE AND SHE BROUGHT ME TO THE LAND OF OZ
IF I WANT TO TALK OR YELL OR WHISTLE BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANYTHING MORE AN UNSEEN HAND SEIZED HER FIRMLY AND THREW HER OUT OF THE DOOR WHICH CLOSED BEHIND HER WITH A SHARP SLAM
THIS MUSIC THING INTERESTS ME
I HAVE THE THREE HAIRS IN THE TIP OF A WOOZY'S TAIL A SIX-LEAVED CLOVER A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL AND A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY
EACH HAS ONE HORN IN THE CENTER OF HIS FOREHEAD WAS THE ANSWER
WE LIVE INSIDE
BUT DON'T MAKE ME ANGRY YOU WOODEN BEAST OR MY EYES WILL FLASH FIRE AND BURN YOU UP THE SAWHORSE ROLLED ITS KNOT EYES WICKEDLY AND KICKED AGAIN BUT THE WOOZY TROTTED AWAY AND SAID TO THE SCARECROW
THAT'S WHAT MAKES OLD CHISS SO DANGEROUS
THIS IS A VERY DELICATE TASK AS I SAID AND I MUST TAKE CARE TO GIVE THE GIRL JUST THE RIGHT QUANTITY OF THE RIGHT SORT OF BRAINS
BUT WHY DO YOU GO TO BED PERSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
BUT THERE WERE NO SIDE PASSAGES SO THEY COULD NOT LOSE THEIR WAY
IS THAT ALL OH NO
THESE STRANGERS HAVE CAPTURED ME THEN SAID ANOTHER WE WILL RESCUE YOU AND CAPTURE THEM FOR WE ARE GREATER IN NUMBER NO ANSWERED THE CHAMPION I CAN'T ALLOW IT
THIS PART OF THE LAND OF OZ WHILE IT BELONGED TO OZMA AND OWED HER ALLEGIANCE WAS SO WILD AND SECLUDED THAT MANY QUEER PEOPLES HID IN ITS JUNGLES AND LIVED IN THEIR OWN WAY WITHOUT EVEN A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD A RULER IN THE EMERALD CITY
WHAT SHALL WE DO SHAGGY MAN
IT WAS A BROAD ROAD BUT NOT STRAIGHT FOR IT WANDERED OVER HILL AND DALE AND PICKED OUT THE EASIEST PLACES TO GO
THE FIRE DELIGHTED SCRAPS WHO DANCED BEFORE IT UNTIL OJO WARNED HER SHE MIGHT SET FIRE TO HERSELF AND BURN UP
ASIDE FROM THE MARBLE STATUES OF UNC NUNKIE AND MARGOLOTTE THE GLASS CAT WAS THERE CURLED UP ON A RUG
I THINK IT HAS
SHE'S OZMA'S BEST FRIEND THEY SAY AND LIVES WITH HER IN THE ROYAL PALACE IS DOROTHY MADE OF TIN INQUIRED OJO
OF ALL THE COMIC ABSURD RARE AND AMUSING CREATURES THE WORLD CONTAINS I MUST BE THE SUPREME FREAK
THE BODY OF THE WOOZY WAS MUCH LARGER THAN ITS HEAD BUT WAS LIKEWISE BLOCK-SHAPED--BEING TWICE AS LONG AS IT WAS WIDE AND HIGH
BUT WHEN SHE HAD THROWN ASIDE HER JEWELED ROBE OF STATE AND HER SCEPTRE AND HAD RETIRED TO HER PRIVATE APARTMENTS THE GIRL--JOYOUS LIGHT-HEARTED AND FREE--REPLACED THE SEDATE RULER
LET'S GO BACK IT'S A LONG WAY BACK DECLARED DOROTHY
THE WOMAN HAD CUT A SLIT FOR THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S MOUTH AND SEWN TWO ROWS OF WHITE PEARLS IN IT FOR TEETH USING A STRIP OF SCARLET PLUSH FOR A TONGUE
ALL HAIL CHAMPION CRIED A MAN IN THE FIRST GROUP OF HOPPERS THEY MET
WHEN OJO WAS ESCORTED INTO THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE HE FOUND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED THERE
DOROTHY HAD BEEN LISTENING WITH INTEREST TO THIS CONVERSATION
I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THE EMERALD CITY SEVERAL WEEKS THIS TIME AND NOW THAT I'VE MET YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS I'M SURE IT WILL INTEREST ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU TO THE GREAT CITY OF OZ AND INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIENDS THAT WILL BE VERY NICE SAID THE BOY GRATEFULLY
MY EYES ARE BUTTONS AND THEY WON'T SHUT SO THE SHAGGY MAN TIED HIS RED HANDKERCHIEF OVER THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S EYES AND EXAMINED ALL THE OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD THEIR EYES FAST SHUT AND COULD SEE NOTHING
AND THEN HE WALKED BACK AMONG THE PLANTS STILL WHISTLING AND FOUND THE THREE LEAVES WHICH WERE CURLED AROUND OJO'S TRAVELING COMPANIONS
AS THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THIS GROVE THEY HEARD SOME ONE IN THE DISTANCE SINGING AND THE SOUNDS GREW NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL THEY COULD DISTINGUISH THE WORDS ALTHOUGH THE BEND IN THE ROAD STILL HID THE SINGER
BUT THE FARMERS DID NOT LIKE TO LOSE THEIR BEES AND SO THEY TRIED TO DESTROY ME
IT'S QUITE A WAY OFF BUT WE'D BETTER LAND AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN THEY LET HIM DOWN AND BEGAN TO URGE THE RAFT TOWARD THE SHORE BY MEANS OF THE POLE
THAT IS I HAVE THE WOOZY AND THE HAIRS ARE IN HIS TAIL
THE CURRENT FLOWS TOWARD THE WINKIE COUNTRY SAID HE
AT ONCE SHE BEGAN TO SLIDE DOWNWARD SO SWIFTLY THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE SCARECROW SHE KNOCKED HIM OFF HIS FEET AND SENT HIM TUMBLING AGAINST DOROTHY WHO TRIPPED UP OJO
WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES BUT RATHER THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICKS
THE CAPTIVE YOOP 21
WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER HUSBAND HAD USED HER CLOTHESLINE AND THE LOGS SHE HAD WANTED FOR FIREWOOD AND THE BOARDS SHE HAD INTENDED TO MEND THE SHED WITH AND A LOT OF GOLD NAILS SHE BECAME VERY ANGRY
BUT I MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO GIVE HER TOO MUCH BRAINS AND THOSE SHE HAS MUST BE SUCH AS ARE FITTED TO THE STATION SHE IS TO OCCUPY IN LIFE
THREE HEADS ARE BETTER THAN TWO AND MY PINK BRAINS ARE BEAUTIFUL
THE LOGS WHICH BORE THEM FLOATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM AND WERE HELD FAST IN THAT POSITION BY THE STRONG CURRENT
AND IF THAT IS TRUE I DIDN'T MAKE A VERY GOOD ARTICLE WHEN I PREPARED IT OR ELSE YOU GOT AN OVERDOSE OR AN UNDERDOSE
WE'RE EV'RY ONE CHOCK FULL OF FUN AND FULL OF MISCHIEF TOO
WE'LL RESCUE THE SCARECROW SOMEHOW I KNOW HOW ANNOUNCED SCRAPS
KRIZZLE-KROO TO ME I GET ANGRY AND THEN MY EYES FLASH FIRE I DON'T SEE AS FIREWORKS COULD HELP OJO'S UNCLE REMARKED DOROTHY
A GLASS CAT IS A USELESS SORT OF THING BUT A PATCHWORK GIRL IS REALLY USEFUL
SOMETIMES THE FACES I CARVE ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS--MORE EXPRESSIVE AND CHEERFUL YOU KNOW--BUT I THINK THEY AVERAGE VERY WELL BEFORE SHE HAD STARTED ON THE JOURNEY DOROTHY HAD PACKED A KNAPSACK WITH THE THINGS SHE MIGHT NEED AND THIS KNAPSACK THE SCARECROW CARRIED STRAPPED TO HIS BACK
GIVE IT UP ADVISED THE GLASS CAT AS THE BOY AROSE AND ASSISTED THE PATCHWORK GIRL TO HER FEET
I USE THEM FOR BRAINS AND WHEN THEY ARE FRESH I AM INTELLECTUAL
BUT PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT HE DID NEVERTHELESS I'M SORRY BOUT THAT SAID DOROTHY GRAVELY FOR NOW THERE WILL BE NO ONE TO HELP HIS POOR UNCLE AND MARGOLOTTE CEPT THIS PATCHWORK GIRL THE WOOZY AND THE GLASS CAT DON'T MENTION IT SAID SCRAPS
WHEN THEY CAME TO A FLAT STONE BY THE ROADSIDE THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN TO REST AND THEN OJO OPENED HIS BASKET AND TOOK OUT THE BUNDLE OF CHARMS THE CROOKED MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM
HERE'S A GLASS CAT
THAT'S WHY I STAY AT HOME THE WOODCHOPPER THEN INVITED THEM ALL TO STAY THE NIGHT AT HIS LITTLE HUT BUT THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO GET ON AND SO LEFT HIM AND CONTINUED ALONG THE PATH WHICH WAS BROADER NOW AND MORE DISTINCT
YOU CAN'T SEE EM WORK BUT THEY'RE THERE ALL RIGHT DECLARED THE SHAGGY MAN
I HAD MADE A PUMPKIN-HEADED MAN AND SET IT UP IN HER PATH TO FRIGHTEN HER FOR I WAS FOND OF FUN AND HATED THE WITCH
THE SAWHORSE RESENTED THIS FAMILIARITY AND WITH A SUDDEN KICK POUNDED THE WOOZY SQUARELY ON ITS HEAD WITH ONE GOLD-SHOD FOOT
DON'T TELL ANYONE I'M A POET
TOTO KNOWS A GOOD MANY THINGS TOO
A DROP OF OIL FROM A LIVE MAN'S BODY OH
THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS NODDED
AT LAST THEY REACHED THE GREAT GATEWAY JUST AS THE SUN WAS SETTING AND ADDING ITS RED GLOW TO THE GLITTER OF THE EMERALDS ON THE GREEN WALLS AND SPIRES
WHOM HAVE YOU CAPTURED NO ONE REPLIED THE CHAMPION IN A GLOOMY VOICE
THE CHIEF TOLD THE MAN THAT HIS JOKE HAD NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE DULL HOPPERS WHO HAD BECOME SO ANGRY THAT THEY HAD DECLARED WAR
BUT I'M SORRY TO HEAR ALL THIS BOUT THE CROOKED MAGICIAN
WITH MORE YEARS HE WILL GROW BIG AND BECOME AS TALL AS UNC NUNKIE OH
WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO DO
BUT IT WAS SO LONG SINCE THEY HAD SEEN A PRISONER THAT THEY CAST MANY CURIOUS LOOKS TOWARD THE BOY AND MANY OF THEM HURRIED AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE TO BE PRESENT DURING THE TRIAL
AND SO UNLESS I WAIT THE SIX YEARS FOR HIM TO MAKE THE POWDER OF LIFE UNC NUNKIE CANNOT BE SAVED OZMA SMILED
BUT SOON HE LAY DOWN AGAIN AS IF TO SAY HE HAD NO INTEREST IN SUCH AN IRREGULAR CREATION
WE MUST SEE OZMA ABOUT THIS MATTER HE SAID
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE WALL--OR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A WALL--SEPARATES THE MUNCHKIN COUNTRY FROM THE GREEN COUNTRY THAT SURROUNDS THE EMERALD CITY WHICH LIES EXACTLY IN THE CENTER OF OZ
HE CAN'T TALK NOT BEING A FAIRY DOG EXPLAINED DOROTHY
I DID MY BEST UNC HE SAID WITH A SOB BUT IT WAS NO USE THEN HE DREW BACK AND LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND THE SIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY QUITE AMAZED HIM
WELL THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN SCRATCHING HIS LEFT EAR IN A PUZZLED WAY
IT WAS A SAD JOURNEY FOR OJO FOR WITHOUT THE WING OF THE YELLOW BUTTERFLY HE SAW NO WAY TO SAVE UNC NUNKIE--UNLESS HE WAITED SIX YEARS FOR THE CROOKED MAGICIAN TO MAKE A NEW LOT OF THE POWDER OF LIFE
IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE A DARK WELL IS IT'S MY FRIEND THE SCARECROW WHERE DOES HE LIVE INQUIRED OJO
AT FIRST HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THE NEWCOMER BUT A LITTLE THOUGHT DECIDED HIM NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS
SIX YEARS
AS THE GUARDIAN UNLOCKED A GATE LEADING FROM HIS ROOM INTO THE STREETS OF THE EMERALD CITY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID TO SCRAPS
I ADVISE YOU TO CHOP IT UP FOR KINDLING-WOOD AND USE ME TO RIDE UPON
I'M TOO LAZY HE SAID
EVEN THE CHILDREN STOOD FIRMLY UPON THEIR SINGLE LEGS AND NEVER LOST THEIR BALANCE
L
IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH MANY OTHER EVILS IN LIFE
TO-DAY AS I WENT BY WHISTLING I SAW A LEAF CURLED AND KNEW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING INSIDE IT
BUT THE THING THAT'S BOTHERING US MOST JACK IS TO FIND THE WELL JACK GAZED AROUND THE LANDSCAPE FOR HE WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF HIS HOUSE
BEFORE THE ROW OF WINDOWS A BROAD SEAT WAS BUILT AND THERE WERE SOME CHAIRS AND BENCHES IN THE ROOM BESIDES
IS SHE PATCHWORK LIKE ME INQUIRED SCRAPS
BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T STAND IT
FOR IF I LET HIM GO HE WILL GET SOME OF HIS QUILLS AND BE ABLE TO THROW THEM AGAIN SO SCRAPS AND OJO PICKED UP ALL THE QUILLS AND TIED THEM IN A BUNDLE SO THEY MIGHT EASILY BE CARRIED
WHY NOT SIR WHY NOT
THAT'S MIGHTY GOOD IT EXCLAIMED
THEY WERE MUCH SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS AND THE MAN ADDED
I'M SURE DOROTHY WILL BE PLEASED WITH HER AND THE SCARECROW WILL DOTE ON HER
TOTO CROUCHED BESIDE HIS MISTRESS AND WAILED AS IF HE DID NOT LIKE THESE STRANGE CREATURES A BIT
BE CAREFUL SAID HE WARNINGLY
WE'LL FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN WE GET TO WHERE HE IS REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL
TOLLYDIGGLE SAT NEAR HIM WHILE HE ATE SEWING ON SOME FANCY WORK SHE HELD IN HER LAP
DON'T YOU THINK THE CREATURE IS A LITTLE BIT CRAZY IT MAY BE HE ANSWERED WITH A PUZZLED LOOK
ITS SADDLE WAS MADE OF CLOTH-OF-GOLD RICHLY ENCRUSTED WITH PRECIOUS GEMS
HIS HEAD'S SO THICK HE CAN'T THINK QUICK SO HE TAKES ADVICE FROM ME STANDING UPON THE BENCH FOR HE WAS SO CROOKED HE COULD NOT REACH THE TOP OF HIS WIFE'S HEAD IN ANY OTHER WAY DR PIPT BEGAN SHAKING THE BOTTLE
YOU'VE ALREADY EATEN A BIG DINNER PROTESTED THE SHAGGY MAN
HOLDING FAST TO ONE ANOTHER THEY ALL FOLLOWED IN A ROW EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE TO BUMP AGAINST THE IRON BARS
OJO WONDERED HOW LONG ONE COULD LIVE IN SUCH A CONDITION AND IF THE LEAF WOULD GRADUALLY SAP HIS STRENGTH AND EVEN HIS LIFE IN ORDER TO FEED ITSELF
THE POOR SCARECROW WENT WHIRLING THROUGH THE AIR AND SO CLEVERLY WAS HE AIMED THAT HE STRUCK OJO'S BACK AND SENT THE BOY TUMBLING HEAD OVER HEELS AND HE TRIPPED DOROTHY AND SENT HER ALSO SPRAWLING UPON THE GROUND
BUT AS I SAID SHE MAY BE WATCHING US THIS VERY MINUTE I DON'T CARE SAID OJO IN AN OBSTINATE TONE OF VOICE
AND THE STUPID HOPPERS COULDN'T SEE IT
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT CAVE ILLUMINED BY THE SOFT INVISIBLE LIGHT SO THAT EVERYTHING IN IT COULD BE PLAINLY SEEN
THEIR HEADS WERE ROUND TOO AND THEY HAD LONG POINTED EARS AND A HORN SET IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREHEAD
AT THIS OJO BEGAN TO CRY
I THOUGHT THE MONKEY WOULD TASTE LIKE MEAT PEOPLE BUT THE FLAVOR WAS DIFFERENT
AS FOR FINDING IT WE MUST TRUST TO LUCK DON'T DO THAT BEGGED OJO EARNESTLY
BUT IT IS REALLY A GOOD NAME FOR ME WELL REMARKED THE WOMAN AS SHE BUSTLED AROUND THE ROOM AND SET THE TABLE AND BROUGHT FOOD FROM THE CUPBOARD YOU WERE UNLUCKY TO LIVE ALL ALONE IN THAT DISMAL FOREST WHICH IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE FOREST AROUND HERE
WHILE POOR MARGOLOTTE STANDS WATCHING ME AS A MARBLE IMAGE CAN'T ANYTHING ELSE BE DONE ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
IS ANYONE IN YOUR PARTY NAMED OJO THE UNLUCKY WHY THAT'S ME CRIED OJO ASTONISHED AT HEARING HIS NAME ON THE LIPS OF A STRANGER
AREN'T YOU FEELING A LITTLE QUEER JUST NOW DOROTHY ASKED THE PATCHWORK GIRL
I SUPPOSE SO
EAT YOUR BREAD UNC AND THEN WE WILL GO TO BED BUT UNC NUNKIE DID NOT EAT THE BREAD
BUT IT WAS A STOUT LEG AND HAD A BROAD FLAT FOOT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT ON WHICH THE MAN SEEMED TO STAND VERY WELL
BUT PERHAPS YOUR LUCK WILL CHANGE NOW YOU ARE AWAY FROM IT
MEANTIME THE WOOZY HAD APPROACHED THE SAWHORSE AND BEGUN TO SNIFF AT IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT IT I'M NOT SURE SHE SAID WITH HESITATION
WHAT ARE YOU MADE OF--GELATINE PURE GLASS ANSWERED THE CAT PROUD TO HAVE ATTRACTED THE SCARECROW'S ATTENTION
HAVE YOU MET OUR SCARECROW THEN ASKED DOROTHY A LITTLE PUZZLED TO UNDERSTAND THE BRIEF HISTORY RELATED
THEN WHY DON'T YOU USE COTTON SUCH AS I AM STUFFED WITH I DON'T NEED THAT KIND SAID OJO
WHEN ANYONE SAYS
THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH
MERCY ME EXCLAIMED THE WOODCHOPPER WHEN AT LAST HE COULD STOP LAUGHING
THEN HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER SOMETHING AND LOOKED UP
HE MUST BE A WONDERFUL MAN SO HE IS AND HIS HEART IS WONDERFULLY KIND
SO HE SAT DOWN ON A STUMP AND FED THE WOOZY BREAD AND CHEESE FOR A LONG TIME
BUT THIS DID NOT DETER OJO AND HIS FRIENDS FROM TRUDGING ON AND THEY BEGUILED THE JOURNEY WITH JOKES AND CHEERFUL CONVERSATION
I THINK THE PATCHWORK GIRL IS BEAUTIFUL CONSIDERING WHAT SHE'S MADE OF
YES SAID UNC
A LOT REPLIED OJO
TURN AROUND ALL OF YOU AND WALK BACKWARD WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO ASKED THE CAT
THIS QUEER WOODEN HORSE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH PRINCESS OZMA WHO HAD CAUSED THE BOTTOMS OF ITS LEGS TO BE SHOD WITH PLATES OF GOLD SO THE WOOD WOULD NOT WEAR AWAY
BUT IF YOU SUCCEED YOU MUST RETURN HERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND THAT WILL SAVE ME MUCH TIRESOME STIRRING OF FOUR KETTLES WITH BOTH FEET AND BOTH HANDS I WILL START ON MY JOURNEY AT ONCE SIR SAID THE BOY
LET ME IN
HE'S SHORTER THAN I AM
FOR INSTANCE THERE'S THE POWDER OF LIFE AND MY LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THAT BOTTLE ON THE SHELF YONDER--OVER THE WINDOW WHAT DOES THE LIQUID OF PETRIFACTION DO INQUIRED THE BOY
OJO AND UNC NUNKIE 2
DOROTHY HAS THE KINDEST LITTLE HEART IN THE WORLD AND SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MANY TROUBLES HERSELF THAT SHE IS SURE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU IS DOROTHY THE LITTLE GIRL WHO CAME HERE FROM KANSAS ASKED THE BOY
THE CHILDREN WHO HAD LEARNED TO LOOK FOR THE BOOKS ABOUT OZ AND WHO LOVED THE STORIES ABOUT THE GAY AND HAPPY PEOPLE INHABITING THAT FAVORED COUNTRY WERE AS SORRY AS THEIR HISTORIAN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE BOOKS OF OZ STORIES
JUST NOW I'VE A RECORD ON TAP THAT IS REALLY SUPERB SAID THE PHONOGRAPH GROWING MORE CHEERFUL
SCRAPS LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY
WHAT A QUEER LOT YOU ARE
THEY'RE INTERESTING
CAN YOU DIG HE ASKED
CHAPTER FIFTEEN OZMA'S PRISONER THE BOY WAS SO BEWILDERED BY THIS CALAMITY THAT HE MADE NO RESISTANCE AT ALL
WHY I--I--CAN'T DESCRIBE IT ANSWERED THE BOY GREATLY PERPLEXED
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THE SCARECROW LIVES IN THE COUNTRY AND SO DO THE TIN WOODMAN AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD
I'M A PATCHWORK GIRL AND I'M STUFFED WITH COTTON DEAR ME SIGHED THE GIANT IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE
I'LL FEED YOU ALL THE BREAD AND CHEESE YOU WANT AND THAT MUST SATISFY YOU ALL RIGHT
THEY SEEM TO EXIST AND YET IT'S ALL SEEMING AND NOT TRUE
BECAUSE I EAT UP ALL THE HONEY-BEES WHICH THE MUNCHKIN FARMERS WHO LIVE AROUND HERE KEEP TO MAKE THEM HONEY ARE YOU FOND OF EATING HONEY-BEES INQUIRED THE BOY
THE BLACK DOTS GREW LARGER AS THEY ADVANCED AND ALTHOUGH THE LIGHT WAS DIM DOROTHY THOUGHT THEY LOOKED LIKE BIG KETTLES TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
I AM NOT STUFFED YOU WILL OBSERVE
FINE SPARKS WEREN'T THEY REG'LAR FIREWORKS REPLIED SCRAPS ADMIRINGLY
THE SCARECROW'S FACE WAS VERY INTERESTING FOR IT BORE A COMICAL AND YET WINNING EXPRESSION ALTHOUGH ONE EYE WAS A BIT LARGER THAN THE OTHER AND EARS WERE NOT MATES
YOU CAN'T EAT HONEY-BEES BUT YOU'LL BE GIVEN SOMETHING JUST AS NICE DOROTHY TOLD HIM
THE LITTLE BAND OF FRIENDS OZMA HAD GATHERED AROUND HER WAS SO QUAINTLY ASSORTED THAT MUCH CARE MUST BE EXERCISED TO AVOID HURTING THEIR FEELINGS OR MAKING ANY ONE OF THEM UNHAPPY
I'VE NEVER LOOKED TO SEE
FOR NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE BOY BROKE OFF THE LOAF AND THE SLICE REMAINED JUST AS BIG
THAT SLAPPING HURTS LIKE SIXTY
AND NOW CONTINUED THE GIRL RULER RISING FROM HER CHAIR YOU MAY FOLLOW ME INTO THE NEXT ROOM CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ WHEN OJO ENTERED THE ROOM HE RAN QUICKLY TO THE STATUE OF UNC NUNKIE AND KISSED THE MARBLE FACE AFFECTIONATELY
MEE-EE-OW-W-W
AFTER YOU LEFT OLD DR PIPT AND I HAD A DREADFUL QUARREL AND HE THREATENED TO SMASH ME TO PIECES IF I DIDN'T KEEP QUIET
WHILE DOROTHY WAS SEWING UP THE HOLE IN THE STRAW MAN'S BACK SCRAPS EXAMINED THE OTHER PARTS OF HIM
I AM SURE I AM RIGHT ABOUT THAT RETURNED THE WOMAN
MY GIRL IS ALL READY FOR YOUR POWDER OF LIFE MY DEAR SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND
THEN THE TIN WOODMAN SUDDENLY ROUSED HIMSELF AND SAID
YOU ARE ONLY A SERVANT AND HAVE NOT BEEN DISCHARGED SCRAPS WHO HAD BEEN DANCING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM STOPPED AND LOOKED AT HIM
I'M A VERY STRONG MAN AND THAT FEROCIOUS ANIMAL WHICH YOU ARE SO KINDLY HOLDING IS THE FIRST LIVING THING THAT HAS EVER CONQUERED ME AND YOU ARE A HOPPER SHE CONTINUED
THE SAWHORSE IS THE FAVORITE STEED OF PRINCESS OZMA THE RULER OF THE LAND OF OZ AND HE LIVES IN A STABLE DECORATED WITH PEARLS AND EMERALDS AT THE REAR OF THE ROYAL PALACE
I WOULDN'T CARE TO HELP OJO'S UNCLE BUT I WILL HELP OJO
THE BANKS OF THE RIVER GREW LOWER TOO PERMITTING THEM TO SEE MORE OF THE COUNTRY AND PRESENTLY THEY DISCOVERED YELLOW BUTTERCUPS AND DANDELIONS GROWING AMONGST THE GRASS FROM WHICH EVIDENCE THEY KNEW THEY HAD REACHED THE WINKIE COUNTRY
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ME GROWL OR YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT DECLARED THE WOOZY
FOR FLESH WOUNDS AND THIS THE BOY SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS
IF YOU STAND ON YOUR LEGS AND YOUR LEGS ARE UNDER YOU THEN--HA HA HA!--THEN YOUR LEGS ARE YOUR UNDER-STANDING
WHY IT SEEMED TO ME A FOOLISH LAW UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE
I BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE A CROSSCUT INTO HIS COUNTRY AND SO GET TO HIS CASTLE A DAY SOONER THAN IF WE TRAVEL BACK THE WAY WE CAME I THINK SO TOO SAID THE GIRL
THEY HALTED BEFORE HE SPOKE AND STOOD LOOKING AT HIM
PLEASE DO
BUT THERE MAY BE SUCH A THING AS A VERY DARK WELL IN THE HORNER COUNTRY WHICH IS A BLACK SPOT ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH WHERE IS THE HORNER COUNTRY OJO INQUIRED
WHO CARES FOR A BUTTERFLY SHE ASKED
WHEN I LIVED IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU I WAS MUCH ANNOYED BY YOUR SQUEAKY HORN
THEN LOOKED AT TOTO AND THE DOG SAID WOOF ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO GO ON SAID SCRAPS
THERE'S BLOOD IN A BODY BUT NO OIL THERE'S COTTON IN MINE SAID SCRAPS DANCING A LITTLE JIG
HE'S A SPLENDID FELLOW AND VERY INTELLIGENT
AND THEN HE SHOOK THE CROOKED HAND OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHO WAS ALREADY BUSY HANGING THE FOUR KETTLES IN THE FIREPLACE AND PICKING UP HIS BASKET LEFT THE HOUSE
THE ONE THAT CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE THREE TIMES DURING THE NIGHT I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE SAID THE BOY THOUGHTFULLY
AND YOUR HORRID GREEN EYES MISS BUNGLE
CHARMS ARE SCARCE
OJO AT ONCE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND DOROTHY WENT ABOUT HALFWAY UP AND SCRAPS STOOD AT THE FOOT OF IT
THIS IS UNC NUNKIE THE DESCENDANT OF THE FORMER KINGS OF THE MUNCHKINS BEFORE THIS COUNTRY BECAME A PART OF THE LAND OF OZ HE NEEDS A HAIRCUT OBSERVED THE CAT WASHING ITS FACE
VERY LIKELY IF WE ASK HIM POLITELY TO LET US PULL THREE HAIRS OUT OF THE TIP OF HIS TAIL HE WON'T HURT US IT WOULD HURT HIM I'M SURE AND THAT WOULD MAKE HIM CROSS SAID THE CAT
THERE WAS A DOOR AND SEVERAL WINDOWS AND THROUGH THE TOP WAS STUCK A STOVEPIPE THAT LED FROM A SMALL STOVE INSIDE
LOOK ALL OF YOU WITH THESE WORDS HE WAVED HIS HANDS TOWARD THE VASE ON THE TABLE WHICH SCRAPS NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME
OJO MUST GO TO PRISON WITH THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS BUT HE WILL BE WELL TREATED AND YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT HIM WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH HIM ASKED SCRAPS
COME WITH ME PLEASE AND I'LL SHOW YOU THE HORNERS SO THEY FOLLOWED THE CHAMPION AND SEVERAL OTHERS THROUGH THE STREETS AND JUST BEYOND THE VILLAGE CAME TO A VERY HIGH PICKET FENCE BUILT ALL OF MARBLE WHICH SEEMED TO DIVIDE THE GREAT CAVE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS
MY EYES ARE BETTER THAN YOURS AND MY PINK BRAINS NEVER MIND YOUR PINK BRAINS PLEASE SAID OJO HASTILY
I SAY WHAT COMES INTO MY HEAD BUT OF COURSE I KNOW NOTHING OF A GROCERY STORE OR BONES WITHOUT MEAT OR--VERY MUCH ELSE NO SAID THE CAT
YOU'RE AS CRAZY AS THE CRAZY-QUILT YOU'RE MADE OF SHE REALLY IS CRAZY REMARKED THE GLASS CAT
HERE IS SOME FOOD AND A BUNDLE OF CHARMS HE SAID
SO THERE HE WAS
ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WAS THREE HAIRS FROM A WOOZY'S TAIL BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PULL OUT THE HAIRS THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE THE WOOZY WITH THEM
WE'RE BRINGING THEM UP ACCORDING TO A BOOK OF RULES THAT WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF OUR LEADING OLD BACHELORS AND EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE A REMARKABLE LOT OF GIRLS SO SCRAPS ACCOMPANIED HIM ALONG THE STREET TO A HOUSE THAT SEEMED ON THE OUTSIDE EXCEPTIONALLY GRIMY AND DINGY
IT'S A QUEER COUNTRY THIS LAND OF OZ
LOTS OF PEOPLE
WE'RE THE JOLLY TOTTENHOTS
SO HE DIVIDED THE PIECE OF BREAD UPON THE TABLE AND ATE HIS HALF FOR BREAKFAST WASHING IT DOWN WITH FRESH COOL WATER FROM THE BROOK
INTRODUCE US AGAIN SHAGGY ONCE IS ENOUGH REPLIED THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHING AT HIS FRIEND'S ENTHUSIASM
SO THEY WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST TO THE FENCE REACHING IT AT A POINT EXACTLY OPPOSITE THAT WHERE THEY HAD ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE
BUT HERE'S A POINTER THAT MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
OJO UNLATCHED THE DOOR AND ENTERED
THE GIRL RULER NOW ASKED OJO TO SIT DOWN AND TELL HER ALL HIS STORY WHICH HE DID BEGINNING AT THE TIME HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME IN THE FOREST AND ENDING WITH HIS ARRIVAL AT THE EMERALD CITY AND HIS ARREST
DOZENS OF THEM WERE SCATTERED AROUND AND DOROTHY BENT NEAR TO ONE WHICH WAS ABOUT AS TALL AS SHE WAS TO EXAMINE IT MORE CLOSELY
NOT IN THE WAY I MEAN
THEN CAME A BROAD CIRCLE OF YELLOW AND THE GREEN WAS AT THE TOP AND FORMED A BRUSH-SHAPED TOP-KNOT
HE LOOKED AT HER THOUGHTFULLY
WHICH ONE
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY-QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
WHY IT'S JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE THEY ANSWERED AND THE CHAMPION ADDED
PERHAPS THERE'S A WELL THERE
OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT WHY NOT MY SKIN IS SO THICK AND TOUGH THAT NOTHING CAN GET THROUGH IT TO HURT ME
NO NEED FOR AN APOLOGY PERHAPS BUT MUCH NEED FOR AN EXPLANATION SAID SCRAPS DECIDEDLY
IN HER ROOM IS A MAGIC PICTURE THAT SHOWS ANY SCENE IN THE LAND OF OZ WHERE STRANGERS OR TRAVELERS HAPPEN TO BE
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PHONOGRAPH PLAY OJO SIGHED
HIS GREATEST FEAR AT THIS TIME WAS THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN IMPRISONED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LEAF AND NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN
MY GROWL MAKES AN EARTHQUAKE BLUSH AND THE THUNDER ASHAMED OF ITSELF
AH SAID OJO
IF I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO MAD THINK AHEAD SAID THE PATCHWORK GIRL SEATING HERSELF IN A CHAIR
I'M SORRY FOR HIS UNCLE AND POOR MARGOLOTTE AND I'D LIKE TO HELP SAVE THEM
HIS SHOES WERE OF BLUE LEATHER AND TURNED UP AT THE TOES WHICH WERE POINTED
MY FEET ARE QUITE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM OF THEM
THEY WERE TRAVELING ALONG THIS CUT TALKING TOGETHER WHEN THE SHAGGY MAN SEIZED SCRAPS WITH ONE ARM AND OJO WITH ANOTHER AND SHOUTED
SO THEY SAT STILL AND WAITED AND EVEN WHILE THEY WERE WONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE THE RAFT SLOWED DOWN STOPPED AND BEGAN DRIFTING THE OTHER WAY--IN THE DIRECTION IT HAD FIRST FOLLOWED
BUT NOW IT'S DIFF'RENT AND NO OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE US ANY MORE THAN WE CAN SEE THEM IF THE MOUNTAIN IS UNDER OZMA'S RULE WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW ABOUT THE HOPPERS AND THE HORNERS OJO ASKED
WHENEVER HE LOST AN ARM OR A LEG HE HAD IT REPLACED WITH TIN
BUT I SPRINKLED SOME OF THAT LIQUID ON THEM AND INSTANTLY THEY TURNED TO MARBLE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW FOR REGRET SINCE ALL THE BRAINS WERE SECURELY SEWN UP INSIDE THE PATCHWORK GIRL'S HEAD
SCRAPS REALIZED IN AN INSTANT THAT THEY HAD GONE TOO NEAR TO CHISS FOR SAFETY SO SHE SPRANG IN FRONT OF OJO AND SHIELDED HIM FROM THE DARTS WHICH STUCK THEIR POINTS INTO HER OWN BODY UNTIL SHE RESEMBLED ONE OF THOSE TARGETS THEY SHOOT ARROWS AT IN ARCHERY GAMES
AND GOOD FIRE TOO
THEN SHE SANG
DOROTHY THOUGHT THE MOST STRIKING THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HAIR WHICH GREW IN THREE DISTINCT COLORS ON EACH AND EVERY HEAD--RED YELLOW AND GREEN
FOR INSTANCE MY MAGIC MADE YOU AND MADE YOU LIVE
OJO NOTICED ONE TREE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH LONG SILKY LEAVES AND WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IN SHAPE
DON'T YOU SEE ASKED DIKSEY WHO HAD LAUGHED EVEN HARDER THAN THE OTHERS
BEING WARNED OF WHAT IS TO OCCUR WE MUST TRY TO BEAR THE TERRIFIC NOISE OF YOUR GROWL
COME OVER HERE AND LET ME SEE THE GLASS CAT HESITATED EYEING THE DOG
WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY SINCE WE MET YOU SIR HE SAID
NEVER MIND ADDED THE CAT
THAT'S WRONG INTERRUPTED THE SCARECROW
THIS ONE IS UGLY AND DANGEROUS OR THEY WOULDN'T CAGE HIM UP
OR ELSE THE RECIPE OF DR PIPT WOULDN'T CALL FOR IT THAT'S TRUE AGREED DOROTHY
NO JAM EITHER
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
I'VE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A SERVANT GIRL FOR MY WIFE YOU KNOW OR A GLASS CAT TO CATCH OUR MICE--WHICH SHE REFUSES TO DO--BUT I AM FORBIDDEN TO WORK MAGIC FOR OTHERS OR TO USE IT AS A PROFESSION MAGIC MUST BE A VERY INTERESTING STUDY SAID OJO
I AM OJO THE UNLUCKY AND WITH ME ARE MISS SCRAPS PATCHWORK AND THE GLASS CAT HE REPLIED
THIS MADE SCRAPS LAUGH MORE HEARTILY THAN EVER AND SHE SAID
I SELDOM SING IN PUBLIC FOR FEAR THEY MIGHT WANT ME TO START AN OPERA COMPANY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN WHO WAS PLEASED TO KNOW HIS EFFORT WAS APPRECIATED
WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY POOR ABUSED PHONOGRAPH VICTOR COLUMBIA EDISON IT ANSWERED
SO THEY TRUDGED BRAVELY ON TO REACH THAT PLACE BY DARK AND SPEND THE NIGHT UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE TREES
PRETTY SOON HE REPLIED
