AND THEN IN THE GLEAM FROM THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS THERE WAS REVEALED UNDERNEATH AND IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DEAD WOMAN A CLEAN SLIT THROUGH HER LIGHT DRESS--A SLIT THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE STAINED WITH BLOOD
I'LL HAVE TO WAIT A BIT
HE SAW THE GLITTERING SHOWCASES IN THE STORE WITH THEIR ARRAYS OF CUT GLASS AND SILVER
SHE SAID IF SHE LEFT HIM IT WAS FOR GOOD AND ALL AND THAT SHE WANTED NONE OF HIS BOUNTY
AH MR GRAFTON YOU WISH TO SEE ME ONLY FOR A MOMENT COLONEL ASHLEY
UP IN HIS HOTEL ROOM COLONEL ASHLEY READ THE STORY OF THE CASE AS PRINTED IN THE TIMES
THIS CROSS BELONGED TO A FRIEND OF MINE
COLONEL ASHLEY USING EXTREME CARE LAID THE TWO TOGETHER AFTER AN EXAMINATION OF THE OTHER UNBROKEN CIGARETTES HAD DISCLOSED THE FACT THAT NONE OF THEM CONCEALED ANYTHING
WELL I AM A FOOL HE MURMURED AS HE PASSED THE PLACE NOW GHOSTLY WITH ITS ONE LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SAFE
WE'VE MISSED YOU I HAVE BEEN SPENDING A WEEK END IN THE COUNTRY KING REMARKED WITH BITING SARCASM
IT MAY CLEAR
YOU'RE A CLEVER KID BUT I COULDN'T DO THAT
YES FOOLISHNESS
WHAT'S UP ASKED THONG QUICKLY
I'D BE A DIRTY DOG IF I DIDN'T
AND THAT IS MAKE AN ARREST AT ONCE EXCLAIMED YOUNG
LIKE HELL YOU WILL HE STEPPED BACK A PACE COLONEL ASHLEY FOLLOWING
SEEING HER LYING AS HE THEN THOUGHT ONLY PERHAPS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED LARCH TAKING THE DIAMOND CROSS STAGGERED AROUND THE JEWELRY SHOP AND THEN FLED PANIC-STRICKEN WENT TO THE HOMESTEAD AND DRANK HIMSELF INTO A STUPOR
WELL THEN I'LL WAIT FOR YOU IN THE VILLAGE AND YOU CAN LET ME SEE IT FIRST
I'M GOING TO QUIT
IF I COULD SEE THE DIAMOND CROSS THAT GRAFTON SAYS LARCH SENT BACK TO HIS WIFE--IF I KNEW WHERE HE GOT IT THE TELEPHONE RANG
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW AND I KNOW WHAT I KNOW
BEHIND THEM CAME THE SHADOWER AND BEHIND HIM AARON GRAFTON
I WILL BE ALMOST AS FRANK WITH YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME
HE'S BEEN FROO IT FO YEAHS SUFFERIN TADPOLES MURMURED THE BOY
I WILL AND NOW WE'LL SEE MR AARON GRAFTON SAID THE DETECTIVE TO HIMSELF AS HE PREPARED TO LEAVE WHETHER YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT
IT IS TRUE A STRONG ELECTRICAL CURRENT MIGHT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES STOP CLOCKS AS WELL AS START THEM
IS MRS DARCY DEAD
CAN IT BE EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
THE POISON HAD GONE DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOOD AS DOES THE VENOM OF A SNAKE AND HAD BROUGHT DEATH IN THE SAME WAY
IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME A MAN HAS MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF OVER A WOMAN AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST
I HAVE IT WITH ME ALSO A FOUNTAIN PEN
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO GET THE CASE READY FOR THE PROSECUTOR WELL LET'S BE GOING THEN SUGGESTED THONG
A BAD THING IN CASE OF A SHORT CIRCUIT
WELL I DON'T KNOW WAS THE COOL RESPONSE
SHE AGREED THAT WAS BEST
AND IT WAS WHILE WE WERE OUT TOGETHER THAT THE CROSS SHE WAS WEARING BECAME UNFASTENED AND FELL
LANGFORD LARCH COULD NOT HIMSELF BE CALLED A DRINKING MAN
I WAS GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER POINT
HE DON'T LAIK T USE DAT PROMISCUIOUS LAIK CAUSE SO MANY FOLKS BODDER HIM
POSITIVELY MY LAST
THAT'S MY PROBLEM COLONEL CHAPTER XII THE ODD COIN COLONEL ASHLEY FISHED FOR A TIME IN SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE GENTLE SNORES OF SHAG FARTHER BACK IN THE FIELD AND BY THE MURMUR OF THE WATER
THE FISHERMAN IV
JUST WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR HE HARDLY KNEW BUT HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN HE DISCOVERED CONNECTED WITH THE MAIN LIGHTING WIRES OF THE STORE OTHER WIRES WHICH RAN TO VARIOUS PLACES IN THE SHELVES AND THE SHOW WINDOWS WHERE MANY OF THE CLOCKS STOOD
ONE OF YOU STAY HERE SO I CAN TELEPHONE IN IF I HAVE TO
ARE YOU COLONEL BRENTNALL SHE ASKED
DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO IN MY LETTER YES BUT NOW THAT ISN'T THE WAY TO TALK ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS
BUT IF THE COLONEL FELT REFRESHED ON REACHING COLCHESTER IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HE WAS IN A FAIR WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM--OR RATHER THE MANY PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY MURDER
IT WAS MORE AS IF SOME ONE HAD BEEN IN MY ROOM SOME ONE IN YOUR ROOM EXCLAIMED BOTH DETECTIVES
HELLO SHOUTED DARCY INTO THE SILENT RAIN AND MIST OF THE EARLY MORNING STREET NOW DESERTED SAVE FOR HIMSELF
BUT KING IS IN A SARCASTIC MOOD NOW AND SUFFICIENTLY ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF TO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS IF WE BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM EVEN UNDER THE GUISE OF FRIENDSHIP I SUPPOSE SO AGREED THE JEWELER AND YET OH I WISH I HADN'T GOT INTO THIS SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY WITH ALMOST A DESPAIRING GESTURE
NOW SPOTTY STREAK IT OUT OF TOWN AS FAST AS A TRAIN CAN TAKE YOU AND--_DON'T COME BACK SPOTTY MORGAN MADE LITTLE WET RINGS ON THE TABLE WITH HIS EMPTY GLASS
WE CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE WHAT WE WANT SAID THONG DRYLY
BUT WHEN MISS BRILL HAD BEEN CARRIED TO A REAR ROOM AND QUIETED AND WHEN THE SHADES HAD BEEN DRAWN TO KEEP THE CURIOUS ONES FROM PEERING IN THE QUESTIONING OF DARCY WAS RESUMED
HAD A FIGHT OVER IT TOO AND IT GOT STEPPED ON OR BANGED UP IN SOME WAY SPOTTY SAYS
ALL THIS COLONEL ASHLEY HAD TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE HE SENT THE TELEGRAM
WELL YES IN A WAY LOOK AT THE DOG'S MOUTH
NOR WAS IT IN THE SHOP AS FAR AS HE KNEW AND HE WENT OVER ALL THE STOCK TO FURNISH A LIST TO THE POLICE SO THEY COULD TELL WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN A ROBBERY AND THERE WAS NONE NONE UNLESS YOU CALL THE TAKING OF THE DIAMOND CROSS A THEFT
HE WAS NOW THIRTY-THREE BUT THE PACE HE WAS GOING AND KEEPING MADE HIS CHANCES OF LIVING OUT THE STATED ALLOTMENT SEEM MEAGER
A LITTLE BLOOD WAS RUNNING DOWN THE LIPS WHICH WERE NOW FOAM-FLECKED
THIS THING IS GETTING MIXED UP
AND THE GLITTERING STONES IN THE CRUSHED CROSS WERE NOT MORE SILENT THAN HE IN HIS MISERY--DESERVED PERHAPS BUT NONE THE LESS MISERY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT FIVE YEARS AGO
HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO RETIRE IN FACT HE SAID HE HAD BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER IT WAS LIKE A SINGER'S FAREWELL ALWAYS POSTPONED
SHE WAS THROWN BACKWARD TO THE FLOOR AND HER HEAD STRUCK A PROJECTING CORNER OF ONE OF THE REAR SHOWCASES
SO IT MAY SEEM THAT I'M NOT QUITE SQUARING THE ACCOUNT BUT IT'S ALL I CAN DO--NOW
NO YOU DON'T LAUGHED THE OLD DETECTIVE
POOR LITTLE DOG TENDERLY THEY BORE HIM OUT THE COLONEL INSISTING THAT NO ONE TOUCH HIM WITH UNGLOVED HANDS AND A LITTLE LATER CHET WAS QUIETLY BURIED
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO THANKS BUT MISS MASON HAS ALREADY ARRANGED TO HAVE ME WHIP HER FATHER'S TROUT STREAM WHEN THIS CASE IS OVER AND THAT'S REWARD ENOUGH FOR ME
I'M TOO OLD TOO OLD COLONEL YES TOO OLD
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE REMARKED THE GUNMAN SPEAKING OUT OF THE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH WITH SCARCELY A MOTION OF HIS LIPS--A HABIT ACQUIRED THROUGH LONG PRACTICE IN PREVENTING PRISON KEEPERS FROM FINDING OUT THAT HE WAS DISOBEYING THE RULES REGARDING SILENCE
I TOLD YOU ANGLING IS AN ART EITHER BY PRACTICE OR LONG OBSERVATION OR BOTH
THAT WILL REMAIN A MYSTERY BUT ITS SOLUTION IS NOT IMPORTANT NOT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE CLEARED JIMMIE BOY LAUGHED AMY AND YET THERE WAS A LOOK OF SADNESS ON HER FACE FOR IT HAD BEEN AN ORDEAL FOR ALL OF THEM
SHE'S DEAD
CHET'S MASTER SENSED SOMETHING WRONG FOR WITH A CRY OF HIS PET'S NAME HE HURRIED TOWARD THE STRETCHED-OUT ANIMAL
HE LOOKED AT THE COLONEL EXPECTANTLY AND THE LATTER STARED AT HIM UNCOMPREHENDINGLY FOR A MOMENT
SOME ONE TO SEE YOU DARCY CALLED THE KEEPER
OF COURSE THAT WAS GOOD BUSINESS POLICY
HE HAD BEEN STROLLING ABOUT THE SHOP AND HAD COME TO A STOP NEAR DARCY'S WORK TABLE--A SORT OF BENCH AGAINST THE WALL AND BEHIND ONE OF THE SHOWCASES
I'VE STRUCK A SNAG--MAYBE A STONE WALL DARCY DO YOU--DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET OVER IT COLONEL BY GAD SIR
I MOST CLUMSILY STEPPED ON IT GREATLY MARRING THE SETTING
I DON'T KNOW AND THE MANAGER SMILED WEARILY
AS FOR BAIT MUSINGLY HE CLOSED THE LITTLE GREEN BOOK AND WATCHED THE SMOKE CURL LAZILY FROM HIS CIGAR
HELLO POLICE VOICED JAMES DARCY
WHO THE GENTLEMAN WHO GAVE YOU THAT NOTE
YOU FOLLOW KING THE DETECTIVE REMAINED MOTIONLESS FOR A FEW SECONDS AFTER HE HAD SLIPPED THE RECEIVER INTO ITS HOOK
AND SPOTTY
YOU ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO JAMES DARCY WHO IS--ER--DETAINED AS A--ER--AS A WITNESS IN THE MURDER OF HIS COUSIN I AM AND SHE SEEMED TO GLORY IN IT
HE KNEW HIS MASTER
I NEVER DID WELL THEN YOU STAND A FINE CHANCE IN GETTING ME TO DO IT NOW
OH SHAG YES SAH COLONEL WAIT A MINUTE
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
BUT NEVER AGAIN MUST HE INTERRUPT ME WHEN HE SEES ME WITH WALTON IN MY HAND
YOU DROPPED THAT I BELIEVE SAID COLONEL ASHLEY GENIALLY ENOUGH
WELL IF HE GETS DRUNK ENOUGH YES
IF IT IS IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN ONE HOOKED UP TO THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CIRCUIT
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO FIND OUT
EXCUSE ME COLONEL BUT YOU ARE WANTED AT THE TELEPHONE ALL RIGHT
BUT NONE OF EM HARDLY STRONG ENOUGH FOR MURDER OH I DON'T KNOW
SUPPOSE AFTER HE HAD LEFT THE WATCH TO BE REPAIRED WITH YOUNG DARCY THE EAST INDIAN HAPPENED TO THINK THAT HE HAD NOT WARNED AGAINST WINDING IT UP WHICH A JEWELER WOULD BE MOST APT TO DO AFTER MAKING REPAIRS
IT BORE NO ADDRESS ON ITS PLAIN WHITE SURFACE AND UNDER PRETENCE OF TURNING SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAST GOLDEN GLOW IN THE WEST THE COLONEL QUICKLY READ THE LETTER
TO CROSS THE STORE TO REACH THE DOOR MEANT STEPPING OVER THE BODY--THE GROTESQUELY TWISTED BODY WITH THE WHITE UPTURNED FACE AND THE LITTLE SPOT OF RED NEAR WHERE THE SILVER COMB HAD FALLEN FROM THE SILVERED HAIR
CHAPTER XXII HIS LAST CASE SLOWLY THE BRUISED AND CUT LIPS MOVED
HERE GET ME BLAKE ON THE LONG DISTANCE
IT--IT'S BOUT ONE OB DEM T'INGS WHAT THINGS
THOSE IN THE VAN FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE GLASS IN GROTESQUE FASHION
MR AARON GRAFTON SEND HIM UP GRAFTON WAS PLAINLY NERVOUS AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM
I JUST COULDN'T RESIST THE PLEADING OF HER EYES
I'M NOT EVEN WORKING ON IT AND I'M NOT GOING TO
WHAT--WHAT'S THIS SNARLED THE MAN STRUGGLING TO RETAIN HIS BALANCE
SHAWL RIGHT OFFISHER
I RECKON MAYBE I DID LOSE ONE OR TWO ON THE WAY BACK CARELESS LIKE YOU LOST SOME OF THOSE DIAMONDS THE COLONEL'S VOICE WAS SHARP
THIS IS BUSINESS YES GOOD BUSINESS FOR YOU BUT BAD FOR ME
HE REALLY DID SEND HER THE CRUSHED GOLD SETTING PROMISING IN THE LETTER HE DISPATCHED TO HER BY THE BOY I INTERCEPTED TO RESTORE THE DIAMONDS TO HER IF SHE WOULD MEET HIM
I WONDER IF THAT CAN BE KETTRIDGE HE MUSED
AH
NOT HERE THERE WAS STARTLED AMAZEMENT IN DARCY'S QUESTION
IF IT WASN'T THAT KING DRINKS SO MUCH THOUGH HE MANAGES TO WALK AND TALK STRAIGHT
HE KNEW WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD KEEP FOR HIM
LET'S HAVE A LIGHT IT'S TOO DARK TO SEE ONE OF THE CLERKS SWITCHED ON MORE ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND THEY GLINTED AND SPARKLED ON THE SILVER AND CUT GLASS
I HAVE NOT TOLD HER SO--BUT HE WAS SILENT A MOMENT
DAT'S JEST WHY I DON'T WAN T TELL YO
WE'LL BE THERE PRETTY SOON AND IF THERE'S ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT I HATE IT'S TO HAVE SOME ONE TALKING WHEN I'M FISHING YES SAH COLONEL UM
BOYS ON DE STREETS YELLIN EXTRY PAPERS NOW ALL BOUT DE MURDER WHO IS IT
I WONDER IF SHE HAS SEEN ME HE MURMURED
LO DARCY WENT ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WALKED UNSTEADILY INTO THE JEWELRY STORE
AND I DON'T FOR ONE MOMENT WISH YOU TO THINK THAT I AM TRYING TO GET ADVANCE INFORMATION TO USE IN HIS FAVOR
I NEVER COUNTED ON THIS
JUST HOW IT HAPPENED NOT EVEN COLONEL ASHLEY NATURALLY THE MOST INTERESTED PERSON COULD TELL AFTERWARD
AND I WISH TO PAY YOU AND THANK YOU
ACTIVE AS HE ALWAYS KEPT HIMSELF THE OLD DETECTIVE SPRANG BACK OUT OF THE WAY
ISN'T THERE ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE ASKED TREMLAIN FOR THE LIVING-ROOMS WERE ABOVE THE JEWELRY STORE--A SUBSTANTIAL BROWN STONE BUILDING OF THE STYLE OF THREE DECADES AGO
WHO IS IT HE ASKED THE CLERK DOWNSTAIRS
HOW DOES IT SOUND TO YOU GENTLEMEN VERY PLAUSIBLE ADMITTED JACK YOUNG
BUT I AM BOUND TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT THE PROSECUTION WILL MAKE THE MOST OF THIS AND THAT--IT LOOKS BAD FOR YOU I KNOW IT DOES COLONEL
HE'LL WANT TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS
DIAMONDS NOTHIN
LARCH GAVE IT TO HIM UNSUSPECTINGLY ENOUGH IT SEEMS
SO AS NO ONE KNOWS I'M IN TOWN THE COLONEL KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT SHAG HAD SAID TO THE NEWSBOY I CAN KEEP UNDER COVER AND HAVE MY FISHING AS I LIKE IT--QUIET
FOR A MOMENT THE COLONEL REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
HE'LL HAVE TO BE HELD--AS A WITNESS ANYHOW WAS THE EASY ANSWER AND IN THE SAME BREATH HE ADDED
I DON'T BLAME DARCY FOR GOING OFF HIS NUT
KEEP BACK CRIED LARCH
PERHAPS I AM BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH
HE CAME OUT AGAIN ON THE FRONT PLATFORM ACCOMPANIED BY A BOY--ONE SEEMINGLY WHO RAN ERRANDS AND DELIVERED TELEGRAMS WHEN ANY CAME TO DISTURB THE PEACEFUL SOLITUDE OF POMPEY
WELL IF I CAN PERFECT THE ELECTRIC LATHE I AM TRYING TO PATENT WAS THE ANSWER
WONDER WHAT JACK WANTS
IT SHOT OUT PUNCTURED HIS LIP AND CHET DIED DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A POISONED WATCH ASKED JACK YOUNG
YES SAH COLONEL YOU'VE OFTEN HEARD ME TALK OF FISHING AND HUNTING HAVEN'T YOU DEED AN I HAS COLONEL
THAT IS THEY WOULD BE IF I HAD BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO HAVE FORMED ARBITRARY THEORIES THAT COULD NOT BE CHANGED
YO SUAH MIGHT
IT WILL BE ALL THE SWEETER
HE HAD PATRONIZED THE JEWELRY STORE AND HE ADMITTED OWING MRS DARCY QUITE A LARGE SUM FOR A BROOCH HE HAD PURCHASED FOR HIS WIFE SOME TIME BEFORE
I'M TALKING TO YOU HARRY MY BOY WENT ON THE DETECTIVE AND I ADVISE YOU FOR YOUR OWN GOOD TO KEEP A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD
OH I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO STAY HERE AND HARD TO HAVE THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO YOUR NAME
DIDN'T HAVE NO NAME ON IT--BROUGHT IT HERE FOR MY OLE FREN DARCY T ENGRAVE
WHEN AS YOU WALK BY A BROOK AND SHALL HEAR OR SEE HIM LEAP AT FLIES THEN IF YOU GET A GRASSHOPPER GAD
I GUESS IT MUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE WELL WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ON MY WORK TABLE WENT ON THE JEWELRY WORKER
I'M A BAD MAN COLONEL YOU KNOW THAT AND MAYBE IF I WAS TO GO TO THE CHAIR--OR THE ROPE ACCORDING TO WHERE I WAS CAUGHT--I WOULDN'T BE GETTING ANY MORE THAN WAS COMIN TO ME
BUT WHAT IS TO HAVE PREVENTED HER FROM HAVING BEEN PUNCTURED BY THE WATCH JUST BEFORE SHE RECEIVED THOSE HURTS
THEN HAVING KEPT HIS PROMISE IN SEEING THAT THE OLD LADY WAS SAFELY HELPED FROM THE TRAIN COLONEL ASHLEY FOLLOWED HIS VALET BURDENED WITH BAGS AND RODS
IKE SQUEALED ON SPOTTY FOR ANOTHER JOB AFTER THEY GIVE HIM THE THIRD DEGREE AND WHEN SPOTTY HEARD OF THAT IT MADE HIM SORE AS IT WOULD ANYBODY
AS FOR MISS RATCHFORD SHE HAS GONE TO FRIENDS IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE I UNDERSTAND MR GRAFTON WILL SHORTLY FOLLOW
WOW
BUT KING IS IN NO CONDITION NOW TO APPROACH ON SUCH A SUBJECT
JUST ABOUT THE SUM DARCY CLAIMED FROM HIS COUSIN
I DIDN'T WANT HIM FOR THIS LITTLE ROBBERY JOB CRIED THE COLONEL I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE DID IT
MOST EVERY ONE OF PROMINENCE IN COLCHESTER AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER HAS MADE PURCHASES IN OUR STORE--SOME MORE SOME LESS
AND HE'S WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE JEWELRY SHOP AND ISN'T
I WANT TO TAKE A RUN OUT TO POMPEY WHERE MISS MASON LIVES
SINGA PHUT IS STILL IN TOWN DOES THAT ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS COLONEL INQUIRED DR WARREN
WE BOTH BELIEVE JIMMIE IS INNOCENT AND WE WANT TO PROVE IT TO EVERYBODY AS SOON AS WE CAN
BUT ARE YOU SURE IT DID DOC PRETTY SURE YES
FOOLED OUT OF MY FISHING THOUGH
DON'T BLAME YOU A BIT LAUGHED THE COLONEL
I GUESS THEY WOULD CHANGE SOME OF THEIR THEORIES THEN
DID HE GIVE ANY PARTICULARS OH YES HE COME ACROSS WITH THE WHOLE STORY WHAT MADE HIM HOLD BACK ON ME THEN
BUT AS LONG AS AMY THINKS I DIDN'T DO THIS HORRIBLE THING--AND GOD KNOWS I DIDN'T--AND AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN ME--WHY I CAN STAND IT
I'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR SIGNATURE AND THE BONDS HE EXCLAIMED IN VOICE TENSE WITH SUPPRESSED PASSION
IN THE SHADOWS XXI
AS SOON AS I COULD I WENT TO THE SHOP TO LOOK FOR THE CROSS
SHE SELDOM CAME DOWN AHEAD OF ME ESPECIALLY OF LATE YEARS
JACK YOUNG WAS ONE OF THE ASHLEY AGENCY'S MOST TRUSTED LIEUTENANTS
BUT ALL JOKING ASIDE THIS IS QUITE A WONDERFUL PIECE OF WORK
I HAVE GOTTEN TO A CERTAIN POINT AND NOW SOME OF MY THEORIES ARE SHATTERED
SHALL I LET HIM IN OH YES I GUESS SO ASSENTED CARROLL WITH A GLANCE AT THONG WHO CONFIRMED BY A NOD OF HIS HEAD WHAT HIS PARTNER SAID
BUT DARK OR LIGHT I THINK I'LL BRING HOME THE RIGHT FISH THIS TIME AND SO AS THE EARLY SHADOWS OF THE LATE AFTERNOON WERE SLANTING OVER COLCHESTER THE OLD DETECTIVE BOARDED A TRAIN KEEPING IN VIEW A WELL-DRESSED FRESHLY-SHAVEN INDIVIDUAL WHO FOR ALL HIS SLICKNESS AND SLEEKNESS SEEMED TO HAVE ABOUT HIM THE AIR OF A TIGER
I WANT TO HELP HIM
THE POLICE HAD TAKEN CHARGE PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF A RELATIVE OF MRS DARCY'S
SHAG YOU KEEP THIS AUTO HERE
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO COLONEL
WHERE'S THE TELEPHONE RIGHT BACK HERE ANSWERED DARCY EAGERLY
BUT SCUSE ME DIDN'T YO FIGGER ON DOIN SOME DETECTIN AN GIVE UP FISHIN AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
I GUESS HE HALF-WHISPERED THAT SHAG WAS RIGHT
DO YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW KING OUT OF TOWN OF COURSE
NOW SIR ONE LAST WORD TO YOU AND THE COLONEL ASSUMED THE MILITARY APPEARANCE THAT SO WELL BEFITTED HIM
I WOULDN'T ADMIT EVEN TO MYSELF MUSED THE COLONEL THAT HE HAD A HAND IN IT OR THAT HE WAS AN ACCESSORY BEFORE OR AFTER
NOW LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
SHALL I RING FOR THE WAGON HIS PARTNER SHOOK HIS HEAD AFTER A LOOK AT DARCY
YOU DON'T LIKE TO TELL ME
AMY--MISS MASON--HOW DOES SHE TAKE THIS HE FALTERED
SO WHEN I GOT IN THIS--WELL I MAY AS WELL CALL IT TROUBLE--I AT ONCE THOUGHT OF YOU
BUT IT WON'T BE QUITE DARK YET FOR SOME TIME HE GLANCED QUICKLY AT THE ENVELOPE
AND WHO ARE YOU HER SECOND COUSIN
AND AS FOR MR GRAFTON THOUGH HE WAS MIXED UP IN THE JEWEL PART OF THE MYSTERY HE WAS ONLY ACTING TO HELP MISS RATCHFORD AS SHE WANTS TO BE CALLED
ON GUARD NEAR A DARK RED STAIN IN THE FLOOR SCARCELY DRY--IT WAS STILL SOAKING INTO THE WOOD
I WONDER--OH BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF WONDERING
I WAS PREPARED TO ASK THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR A PRETTY STIFF ANNUAL SUM FOR MY CLIENT FOR I KNOW LARCH IS RICH WHEN TO MY SURPRISE SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT
SHOOT AND THE CAR SHOT UP WITH SPEED ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE COLONEL TO GASP USED AS HE WAS TO RAPID MOTION
ONCE OR TWICE SHE MET ME AND WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THE WOODS THE COLONEL LOOKED SHARPLY AT HIS CALLER
HAVE YOU ANY THEORY CAME AT THAT INSTANT FAIRLY BURSTING INTO THE QUIET GRILL ROOM SOME JOLLY GOOD FELLOWS TO TAKE THEM AT THEIR OWN VALUATION
I'LL GO OUT AND HAVE A LOOK HE MADE HIMSELF READY TAKING THE TWO PARTS OF THE FISHING ROD WITH HIM
THAT'S WHAT AARON GRAFTON IS DOING--WORRYING
THE NEWSBOY WITH AN ABASHED AIR SLID DOWN THE AISLE
I TOOK THE CROSS TO HER THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED AND SHE PROMISED TO HAVE HER COUSIN FIX IT WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHOSE IT WAS AND GET IT BACK TO ME SECRETLY IN A DAY OR SO
BUT HOW IN THUNDER AM I GOING TO GET DARCY OFF IF I HAVEN'T ANY ONE TO OFFER THE TINKLE OF THE TELEPHONE BELL INTERRUPTED THE COLONEL'S HALF-ALOUD MUSING
OH SURE
GOT HER NAME ALL GRAVED ON IT NICE AN PRETTY
I DIDN'T GO INTO THAT DEEPLY
DON'T TOUCH IT CAME THE SHARP COMMAND AS JACK YOUNG TOOK A STEP FORWARD EVIDENTLY WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING THE DISTRESSED ANIMAL
MRS DARCY MAY MERELY HAVE PUT THE CROSS AWAY SECRETLY AND IT MAY TAKE A CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE PLACE TO FIND IT MAYBE SO
IT--IT'S IN HER HAND AND HE NODDED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SILENT FIGURE DOWNSTAIRS
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES IT GO UNLESS SOME ONE GOT IN AND WOUND IT--AND THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT WHOSE WATCH IS IT ASKED THONG
I'M GOING TO DO A BIT OF SHADOW WORK AND IT MAY TAKE ME UNTIL SUNRISE
I HEAR HE HAS QUITE A TEMPER--DIFFERENT FROM HARRY KING'S BUT ENOUGH ESPECIALLY IF HE GOT RILED ABOUT THE OLD LADY TALKING AGAINST HIS GIRL
I WANT TO GET A FEW MORE FACTS THIS THE COLONEL PROCEEDED TO DO
BLAST THAT SHAG
AND SO MISS RATCHFORD--TO USE HER MAIDEN NAME--HAS THE DIAMOND CROSS BACK AGAIN MUSED THE COLONEL
THE MAN I SAW IN THE JEWELRY STORE GASPED GRAFTON
HE ADMITTED HAVING LEFT HIS WATCH AT THE SHOP TO BE REPAIRED SOME DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER AND HAD NOT CALLED AT THE STORE SINCE EXCEPT ON THE MORNING OF THE CRIME AND SOME TIME AFTER ITS DISCOVERY TO GET HIS TIMEPIECE WHICH OF COURSE HE WAS NOT THEN ALLOWED TO TAKE
THE GIRL'S PRETTY FACE WAS DRAWN AND CAREWORN
LET ME SEE IT JUST A MOMENT WITHOUT HESITATION THE BOY HANDED IT OVER
KEDGE IS ALL RIGHT FOR SOME THINGS BUT OH WELL I'LL KEEP ON WITH THE CASE THIS WAS THE DAY FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY OF THE SUICIDE OF THE EAST INDIAN IN HIS CELL AND ANY INTENTIONS COLONEL ASHLEY MAY HAVE HAD OF SUBJECTING TO A CLOSE EXAMINATION THE QUEER WATCH HAD TO BE POSTPONED
OH AMY
HE'LL NEVER HURT ANY ONE
DON'T TOUCH HIM WITH BARE HANDS POISONED COLONEL
I'LL PLAY POSSUM FOR A WHILE HAVING FOLLOWED HIS MAN TO THE LATTER'S STORE AND EVEN INSIDE IT WHERE HE MADE A TRIFLING PURCHASE AND HAVING SEEN MR GRAFTON ENTER HIS PRIVATE OFFICE THE DETECTIVE PAID A VISIT TO DARCY IN THE JAIL
YES--YES SAID THE COLONEL IMPATIENTLY
CHAPTER XV A DOG WITH THE HELP OF THE POLICE AND WHEN THE STRICKEN THOUGH NOT DANGEROUSLY INJURED GIRL HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY IN THE AMBULANCE THE CROWD WAS DISPERSED
SAYS I'M TO TELL YOU HE'S MR YOUNG OH YES JACK YOUNG--SEND HIM UP THE COLONEL CLOSED THE BOOK WITH A SIGH OF REGRET
NO AND THAT'S THE QUEER PART OF IT SAID THE MANAGER
I'M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET
SOMEHOW THAT SEEMED TO FOLLOW HIM AS A NEMESIS
WELL AS HE HAS TOLD YOU HE HEARD WHO YOU WERE COLONEL FROM YOUR MAN
VERY INTERESTING OBSERVED THE COLONEL AS HE PASSED THE WATCH BACK TO DONOVAN STILL USING ONLY THE FLAT OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ON WHICH TO REST IT
SAY WHAT'S THIS FOR QUESTIONED THE LAD IN ASTONISHMENT
IT WAS THEN COLONEL ASHLEY HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO MR KETTRIDGE
HE'S GOING TO KILL ME SCREAMED CYNTHIA
HIS PAL DONE HIM DIRT AND THAT'S WHY HE SPLIT
IT IS SOME LITTLE RIDE YET
THERE WAS SOME THING VAGUELY FAMILIAR ABOUT THE BOY THOUGH THE FISHERMAN DID NOT TAX HIS MIND WITH REMEMBERING THEN WHERE OR WHEN HE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE
MY MARSTER COLONEL BRENTNALL--DAT AIN'T HIS REAL NAME BUT IT'S DE ONE HE GOES BY SOMETIMES--HE DON'T CARE FO NO DETECTIVE STORIES CAUSE HE DONE MAKE HIS LIVIN AN MINE TOO AT DETECTIN HE SAYS HE DON'T EVER WANT T READ EM CAUSE DEY AIN'T AT ALL LIKE WHUT HAPPENS
TAKE WIFELY HOME LI'L PRESHENT--YOU KNOW HOW TISH
ISN'T THIS DREADFUL SHE EXCLAIMED HOLDING OUT A PAPER
HE'S ALL RIGHT
YES DECIDEDLY I THINK YOU WILL BEAR WATCHING FOR AT THAT MOMENT THE MERCHANT AFTER ANOTHER ROUND OF THE STORE SEEKING FOR SOMETHING IT SEEMED HE COULD NOT FIND TURNED AND HURRIED OUT A MUCH-TROUBLED LOOK ON HIS FACE
ME--I GOT NO USE FOR EM
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW YOU--YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME UP DON'T DARE SAY SUCH A THING JIMMIE BOY AND THE GIRL'S EYES SPARKLED WITH A NEW LIGHT
FOR THEY RECOGNIZED THAT THE COLONEL WOULD BE AGAINST THEM AND THE PROSECUTOR'S DETECTIVES WHEN IT CAME TO THE TRIAL OF JAMES DARCY
SHAG SOUGHT OUT THE DISCOMFITED NEWSBOY AND CHUCKLING AS HAD HIS MASTER HANDED THE LAD A DOLLAR
MORE THAN ONE NEEDLE WAS SENT TO GUARD AGAINST FAILURE
SHE WENT AWAY A SHORT TIME AGO AND CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME HER STORY
THE COLONEL IS SURPRISED VIII
PRAY GO ON IN FACT WE WERE SWEETHEARTS CONTINUED GRAFTON AND WERE ENGAGED
YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME CYNTHIA YOU SHE-DEVIL
I HOPE SHE FINDS AS MUCH HAPPINESS AS AS WHO ASKED DARCY AS AMY HESITATED
SO I TOOK IT TO MRS DARCY'S PLACE AND SHE WAS FOUND MURDERED BROKE IN THE OLD DETECTIVE QUICKLY
I TOLD HER I HAD MY OWN FUTURE TO LOOK TO AND WE OFTEN HAD WORDS ABOUT THAT
I KNOW I CAN DEPEND ON SHAG AND AS FOR YOU I'M WITH YOU TILL THE COWS COME TO ROOST COLONEL
THE SLEUTHS CAN KNOCK WHEN THEY GET HERE
MAYBE ASSENTED THE COLONEL UNRUFFLED
THAT MECHANISM WAS BUILT INTO THE WATCH AFTER IT WAS ORIGINALLY MADE I'M SURE
THE STOCK IS CHECKED UP AS WELL AS I CAN DO IT IN A SHORT TIME REPLIED THE JEWELRY WORKER WHO HAD SPENT SOME TIME GOING OVER THE STORE UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYES OF CARROLL AND THONG
TELL HER YOU SAW ME--LAUGHING AND DARCY DID MANAGE TO UTTER WHAT MIGHT PASS FOR A LAUGH
I SHOULD FEEL OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF MY KNOWLEDGE
IT'S WORTH ALL OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A COLLECTOR
NOW WHICH WAS IT WELL IF YOU CALL A CLOCK STRIKING A NOISE THEN IT WAS ONE OH A CLOCK STRUCK AND THONG SETTLED BACK IN HIS CHAIR MORE AT HIS EASE
ONE NIGHT PARTLY INTOXICATED WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FOR HIM AND PERHAPS ON THIS OCCASION DONE IN DESPERATION LARCH CALLED AT THE JEWELRY STORE
BUT I'M THROUGH
THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK SWORE AUDIBLY BUT IT WAS MORE A PRAYER THAN AN OATH
THE POLICE HAD BEEN BUSY THE PROSECUTOR'S DETECTIVES ALSO BUT SO FAR THE ARREST OF DARCY AND KING HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONES MADE
I TOLD HIM HE HAD TO IF HE WANTED TO FISH IN DAD'S TROUT STREAM AND SHE LAUGHED--A STRANGE SOUND IN THAT GLOOMY PLACE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO IN THIS CASE ARE YOU GOING TO OFFER THAT TO THE JURY TO CLEAR DARCY ASKED MR KETTRIDGE
THEY WERE COLD AND WAX-LIKE TO HIS TOUCH
I CAN RAISE IT ON A NOTE IF YOU'LL SIGN IT AND PUT UP THOSE BONDS FOR SECURITY AND BY HE CAUGHT HER WRIST IN A GRIP THAT MADE HER WINCE WITH PAIN AS HE SWUNG HER AROUND TO FACE HIM
HELLO HARRY
HE SMILED AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE COLONEL
THE LITTLE ANIMAL SUDDENLY LOOKED UP AT THEM IN A PECULIAR MANNER
A DETECTIVE STORY OH MAH GOOD LORD SHAG WHICH WAS ALL COLONEL ASHLEY EVER CALLED HIS SERVANT THOUGH THE COLORED VALET REJOICED IN THE PREFIXES OF GEORGE WASHINGTON THREW UP HIS HANDS IN HORROR AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I WONDER OH WHAT AM I BOTHERING ABOUT IT FOR ANYHOW
BUT KING WAS IN JUBILANT MOOD
SHE'S QUICK IF SHE IS OLD SO I GOT HER DOWN ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK AND WE STARTED IN THEN EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW
NODDING AND SMILING AT HIS FRIENDS WHO THRONGED ABOUT HIM STANDING UNDER THE GAY LIGHTS WHICH REFLECTED FROM COSTLY OIL PAINTINGS HARRY KING PLUNGED HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET TO PAY THE BILL A CHECK FOR WHICH THE BARTENDER HAD THRUST TOWARD HIM
OH HANG IT
A LONG SLENDER STICK WAS BROUGHT AND USING GREAT CARE WITH HIS RUBBER GLOVES ON THAT HE USED IN AUTOPSIES DOCTOR WARREN FASTENED THE NEEDLE TO THE WAND
YOU DID YES WHEN I TESTED THEM WITH AN INSTRUMENT I SECURED FROM AN ELECTRICIAN HERE IN TOWN THE WIRES WERE DEAD
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO WITHOUT YOU HE ASKED
EVIDENTLY THE ANXIETY OVER DARCY WAS BEGINNING TO TELL ON HER
CONFIRMING OVER THE LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE THE NEWS GIVEN IN HIS AGENT'S TELEGRAM COLONEL ASHLEY WITHOUT HAVING REVEALED TO GRAFTON WHAT NEW DEVELOPMENT HAD OCCURRED HAD MADE A QUICK TRIP TO LANGO WHERE SPOTTY IN RESPONSE TO A QUIET BUT GENERAL ALARM SENT OUT HAD BEEN ARRESTED
ALL OF THIS SHE HAD DONE IN A MEASURE
SHE TURNED ON THE CURRENT TO ILLUMINATE THE INSIDE OF THE CASE SO THAT HER CUSTOMER MIGHT MAKE A SELECTION TO HAVE SPREAD OUT ON TOP WHEN IN SOME MANNER MISS BRILL RECEIVED A SEVERE ELECTRICAL SHOCK
SAY I GOT A SWELL DETECTIVE STORY THE BOY STARTED OUT OF THE COMPARTMENT
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY BEGAN THE COLONEL
BUT TAKE IT FROM ME WENT ON SHAG HE DON'T NEED NO BOOKS T MAKE EXCITIN READIN FO HIM
SMALL FRY WHEN YOU CAN'T GET BIG ONES
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAN
WELL SHE DID SHINE FOR A WHILE FOR THE HOMESTEAD WAS NOT AN ORDINARY HOTEL
WHAT IS IT I DIDN'T HEAR ALL THE PARTICULARS
WELL SINGA COMING SAY AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO THE JEWELRY STORE FINDS MRS DARCY THERE
HE HAD BEEN RELEASED UNDER HEAVY BAIL IT IS TRUE WHEN THE HOTEL KEEPER GAVE A PLEDGE FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN WHEN HE WAS WANTED
THE HEIGHTS WAS THE FAVORITE TRYSTING PLACE OF LOVERS AND MANY WERE THE PLEASANT SPOTS THERE
NO HANG IT ALL
THE COLONEL'S HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS POCKET WHERE SOMETHING METALLIC CLICKED
I'LL WAGER WHEN I TRY I CAN FIT THAT GUN BUTT INTO THE DEPRESSION OF THE FRACTURE
I KNOW WHEN THE GOIN'S GOOD
I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED THAT
AND WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TO-DAY COLONEL ASKED MR KETTRIDGE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD THE BUSINESS RUNNING SMOOTHLY AGAIN
HAVING SERVED WITH DISTINCTION IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR AMONG HIS EXPLOITS BEING THE CAPTURE OF A NUMBER OF SPIES IN A SENSATIONAL MANNER HE HAD BECOME THE HEAD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN A LARGE CITY IN THE EAST
DON'T--DON'T TOUCH ME THIS SEEMED TO MADDEN THE MAN FOR HE SPRANG TOWARD HER FURY AND THREAT IN EVERY GESTURE
I WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS
I SHOULD PREFER TO GO ON WITH THE TRIAL NOW BUT I REALIZE THAT THE MATTER IS OUT MY HANDS THE CASE THEN STANDS ADJOURNED FOR TWO WEEKS ANNOUNCED THE COURT AND THE OFFICER ARISING ANNOUNCED
I HAD GUESSED THAT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT IS WHY I WARNED DONOVAN TO BE CAREFUL
YET DARCY FELT HE MUST HAVE SOME ONE WITH HIM
BUT IT'S THE BEST I CAN DO
WHEN I WANT HIM I CAN LAY MY HANDS ON THE REAL MURDERER
BUT I'D A HAD HIM ALL RIGHT
SOME ONE STOPPED--THEN ANOTHER
WE DON'T GO IN FOR THAT--NOT ME AND CARROLL
YOU CAN'T DEFIED THE CROOK
KING HAD A NASTY TEMPER THAT GREW WORSE WITH HIS INDULGENCE IN DRINK AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE HAD BEEN INDULGING AND INTENDED TO CONTINUE
BUT I GUESS THAT DOESN'T MATTER ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE BESIDES YOU AND THE POLICEMAN YAWNED--FOR HE HAD GONE OUT ON DOG-WATCH--AND LOOKED INTO THE WET SHINY DRIZZLE-SWEPT STREET
I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED WAS THIS ODD COIN IN HER COLLECTION ASKED THE COLONEL AS HE LOOKED AT THE PIECE WHICH KETTRIDGE HANDED HIM
WHERESH MY PAPER CUTTER DARCY OL MAN SILENTLY THE JEWELRY WORKER POINTED TO THE STAINED DAGGER--IT WAS REALLY THAT THOUGH DESIGNED FOR A PAPER CUTTER
I'LL TELL YOU ALL I CAN IN REASON BUT IF THANK YOU
OFTEN ENOUGH THERE IS NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A LITTLE INDISCRETION BUT I CAN SEE WHERE OUTSIDERS MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE--PARTICULARLY HUSBANDS
NOW I WON'T BE MUCH MORE THAN A MINUTE AND WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU I CAN PROPOUND RIGHT HERE AS WELL AS ANYWHERE
WELL I'LL DO WHAT I CAN THERE WERE FEW TRICKS KNOWN TO MODERN DETECTIVES OF WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY WAS NOT MASTER AMONG THEM BEING THE ABILITY TO DISGUISE HIMSELF--NOT BY CLUMSY BEARDS AND FALSE MOUSTACHES THOUGH HE USED THEM AT TIMES--BUT BY A FEW SIMPLE ALTERATIONS TO HIS FACE AND CARRIAGE
WHUT IS IT GET ME AN AUTO SHAG--ANY KIND OF CAR WILL DO
BETTER GET THE POLICE RIGHT AWAY MURDERED ASKED TREMLAIN WHO HAD REMAINED BESIDE DARCY NEAR THE SHOWCASE WHERE THE SILVER GLEAMED
BUT I DON'T ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO THAT
I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM ON MY HANDS WHAT IS IT
POOR LAD HE'S IN TOUGH LUCK--JUST WHEN HE OUGHT TO BE THINKING OF GETTING MARRIED
YOU'RE IN PLENTY OF TIME
SO YO HAS COLONEL CRIED THE NEGRO
I MAY CALL ON YOU
SO DARCY'S JEWELRY STORE WAS KNOWN AND THOUGH A BIT OLD-FASHIONED IN A WAY WAS FAVORABLY KNOWN NOT ONLY TO THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE RICH FAMILIES OF THE PLACE BUT TO THE YOUNGER SET AS WELL
SHE SURPRISED ME WHEN SHE TOLD ME
NOW THEN SLIDE OUT OF HERE--TAKE A WALK ADVISED MULLIGAN AS HE SHOVED OUT SOME OF THE MEN AND BOYS WHO HAD ENTERED
I DO HEAR SOMETHING TICKING AND THE POLICEMAN LOOKED AT DARCY
HE'S BEEN MAKING SOME POOR INVESTMENTS OF LATE AS WELL AS GAMBLING HEAVILY AND HIS MONEY CAN'T LAST FOREVER
IT WAS USED TO CUT THE OLD LADY THOUGH AND LAID BACK ON DARCY'S WORK-TABLE
THAT WAS BEFORE THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS CRUEL TREATMENT OF HIS WIFE BECAME KNOWN
WHAT'S THE MATTER IF THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE A MURDER WITH DOING IT IN THE AFTERNOON
I WISH I DID
IT WAS FROM JAMES DARCY AND READ
DON'T GO NEAR HIM JACK FOR UNLESS I'M MUCH MISTAKEN THE TWO MEN GAZED AT THE DOG
COLONEL TO PUT YOU TO ALL THIS TROUBLE POOH
WHO HAS IT PINKUS AND DONOVAN
YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT IN THE PAPERS
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO--COLONEL ASHLEY AND AMY LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT HER LOVER
HE DIDN'T EAT ANY SUPPER THOUGH BUT THAT'S NOTHING
THE DETECTIVE EVEN OPENED HIS LIPS TO SPEAK BUT NO SOUND CAME THROUGH THEM
OH IT'S YOU IS IT BASSET
HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CHLOROFORM THE JEWELRY WORKER IT WAS SUGGESTED AND PERHAPS DID SLIGHTLY
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ANY QUESTIONS
BUT NOW YOU FOLLOW HARRY KING
DESIRING MORE TIME TO DEVOTE TO THE DETECTION OF CRIMES OF OTHER THAN ORDINARY INTEREST AND REALIZING THAT THE ROUTINE OF POLICE WORK WAS TOO HAMPERING FOR HIM THE COLONEL HAD OPENED AN OFFICE IN NEW YORK WHERE STRAIGHTWAY HE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE PERSONS MORE WORK THAN HE COULD WELL ATTEND TO
BUT BUSINESS IS BUSINESS FROM NOW ON
HE RUBBED THEM AGAIN--HE PASSED HIS HAND BEFORE HIS FACE AS IF COBWEBS HAD DRIFTED THERE--HE TOUCHED HIS EARS WHICH SEEMED NOT A PART OF HIMSELF
THAT'S ALL THESE OPINIONS CAME MOSTLY FROM BOYS OR YOUNG MEN
QUITE A PLACE
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN PAY MY DEBT TO YOU THE COLONEL MADE AS THOUGH TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND TO THE FRECKLE-FACED MAN OPPOSITE HIM AND THEN CHANGED THE MOTION OF HIS ARM AND PICKED UP HIS GLASS
AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOME OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE CLARIFIED BY A DALLYING ALONG THIS STREAM
AS I SAID I SAW THEM AND PARTICULARLY THE ONE WE PICKED UP LAST NIGHT IN HER SAFE A WEEK OR SO BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
BUT DERE'S BEEN ANNUDDER MURDER IN TOWN ANOTHER MURDER YES COLONEL
WHO YOU TALKIN TO NOW TAKE IT EASY HARRY ADVISED THONG
DAD ALWAYS LOOKS OUT FOR HIS BOYS AND SO TOM WENT ON THE ROAD I HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT HAD MOTION IN IT TOM EXPLAINED IN AN ASIDE
I WAS GOING TO TELL MISS MASON TO GO AND GIVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO DARCY BUT MAYBE I'D BETTER WAIT NOW CAN YOU PRODUCE THE REAL MURDERER COLONEL ASHLEY I CAN MR KENNETH
IN THE FIRST PLACE I WANT YOU TO SIGN A PAPER
AND YET OH WELL WHAT'S THE USE OF SPECULATING
SO HE'S BOASTING THAT WELL ALL SORTS OF THINGS MAY HAPPEN NOW
IT'S YOUR LIFE AND LIBERTY FOR MINE--MAYBE NOT QUITE AN EVEN EXCHANGE SINCE YOU'D HAVE MORE THAN EVEN CHANCES IF IT CAME TO A TRIAL I SUPPOSE
I CAN NOT ACCEPT A RETAINING FEE UNTIL I HAVE HEARD MORE OF YOUR CASE
SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE ADDRESS OF THE JEWELRY STORE CLUNG TO HIS MIND AND ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY HE FOUND HIMSELF HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION
WITH THE CIGARETTES IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS EASY ENOUGH FOR SINGA PHUT TO SMOKE SOME AND EXTRACT A NEEDLE FROM ANOTHER
HOW'D YOU FIND THINGS WHEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
AND YOU AS THE OWNER OF A LARGE DEPARTMENT STORE WHERE SHOP-LIFTING AND OTHER CRIMES MAY BE COMMITTED ANY DAY ARE OFTEN IN NEED OF THE SERVICES OF DETECTIVES I SHOULD SAY I AM BUT WELL DON'T WORRY
YOU'LL NEVER BE DAT
PROCEED WELL THEN THE DIAMOND CROSS WHICH IS WORTH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THOUSAND DOLLARS BELONGS TO MRS CYNTHIA LARCH THE WIFE OF LANGFORD LARCH WHO KEEPS A LARGE HOTEL IN COLCHESTER
IT HATH BEEN HIGHLY PRIZED IN ALL AGES
AFTER THAT I MAY HAPPEN TO KNOW MORE THAN I KNOW NOW AND IT WOULD BE MY DUTY--WHETHER I'M OFFICIALLY ON THE CASE OR NOT--TO ARREST YOU
BUT IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO TELL ANYTHING ABOUT WHERE HE GOT THAT QUEER COIN--THE ONE THAT USED TO BE IN MRS DARCY'S COLLECTION--SO MUCH TO THE GOOD
AND SO SPOTTY HAS CONFESSED
YES THE CLOCKS HAVE ALL STOPPED HE SAID WETTING HIS LIPS WITH HIS TONGUE
I MEAN YOUR COUSIN I TOLD HER I COULD SUPPORT MY WIFE DECENTLY WELL IF NOT IN SUCH STATE AS THAT TO WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE
AND THE STOPPING OF THE CLOCKS
HE OF COURSE KNEW JUST WHAT IT WOULD DO AND HOW TO SET IT SO THAT IF A PERSON AT A CERTAIN HOUR TOOK IT INTO HIS OR HER HANDS AND EXERTED ANY PRESSURE ON THE RIM THE NEEDLE WOULD SHOOT OUT AND PUNCTURE THE FLESH
SHE WAS A FRIENDLY WOMAN
WELL BY GAD SIR THEY SHAN'T
POOR LITTLE DOG AND JACK WHO LOVED ANIMALS LOOKED AT THE LIMP BODY
HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I'D FIND OUT
I CAN LOOK AFTER THE COURT PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR THEM BUT WHAT WE WANT MOST IS EVIDENCE TENDING TO SHOW THAT SOME ONE ELSE AND NOT YOU COMMITTED THIS CRIME AS MOST ASSUREDLY WAS THE CASE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DAYS DARCY'S VOICE HAD ITS OLD RING AND VIGOR IN IT
PROMPT ACTION ON THE PART OF THE PHYSICIAN ON THE HOSPITAL AMBULANCE HAD STARTED HER FEEBLE HEART WHICH HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY TO BEATING
AND IT IS DELICATE I COULD SAY THAT OF NEARLY EVERY ONE ALSO SO THAT I MAY RELY ON YOUR SILENCE AND--ER--DISCRETION SIR THE COLONEL FAIRLY BRISTLED
DOES YO KNOW WHO THE COLONEL IS NO BUT HE'S MIGHTY WHITE IF HE WANTS TO BUY A DOLLAR'S WORTH OF BOOKS AND PAPERS
AH CHET YOU'VE COME IN FOR ANOTHER TALK HAVE YOU ASKED THE COLONEL AS HE LEANED OVER TO PAT THE DOG'S HEAD
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING NOTHING UNTIL I'VE MADE AN EXAMINATION
I WANT TO GO FISHING
PROBABLY NEW WORKS PUT IN
DID I SAY ANYTHING AND THE DETECTIVE SEEMED ROUSED FROM A REVERIE FOR HE HAD SPOKEN HIS LAST REMARKS IN A LOW VOICE
THAT'S WHY I CAME TO YOU PERFECTLY RIGHT JACK
I NEVER MAKE A STATEMENT THOUGH UNTIL AFTER THE AUTOPSY
THERE IS A SAYING THAT WHEN THE WINE IS IN THE WIT IS OUT AND IT IS GENERALLY HELD BY SOME DETECTIVES THAT THEN IS THE PROPER TIME TO APPROACH A SUBJECT FOR INFORMATION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE WITHHELD
I'VE GONE TOO FAR
AND IT WAS AT HER SUGGESTION THAT HE FOLLOWED HER WHEN I WAS SHADOWING LARCH
LISTEN
MASON SO THOROUGHLY BELIEVES IN THE INNOCENCE OF DARCY AND HE STICKS BY HIS DAUGHTER'S ENGAGEMENT SO WELL THAT HE'D SUPPLY TWICE AS MUCH CASH AS WAS NECESSARY TO SIFT THIS TO THE BOTTOM
MRS DARCY'S MAID WON'T BE IN UNTIL NOON
THE COLONEL HELD UP A PROTESTING HAND
THE LOW-POWERED BULB WAS TAKEN OUT AND THE GLARING NITROGEN GAS ONE SUBSTITUTED
NOT A HEAVY DOWNPOUR WHICH SPLASHED CHEERFULLY ON UMBRELLAS AND FORMED SWOLLEN STREAMS IN THE GUTTERS WHENCE THEY RUSHED TOWARD THE SEWER BASINS CARRYING WITH THEM AN ACCUMULATION OF STICKS LEAVES AND DIRT
HE MADE A FEW RAPID CHANGES IN HIS CLOTHING AND TOOK OFF A TINY BIT OF EYEBROW WHICH HAD BEEN ADDED TO HIS OWN A SHORT TIME BEFORE
LITTLE TOO LATE WAS THE ANSWER
THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF HIS LITTLE GREEN BOOK AND HE READ
DON'T WANT THAT ALL BURNED--SPOIL SHINGS HAVE EM BURNED
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO WHEN A MAN CAN'T READ WHAT HE LIKES WITHOUT EVERY WHIPPERSNAPPER INTERRUPTING HIM WITH--SHAG
AND YOU FOUND THE OLD LADY LIKE THIS ASKED CARROLL
PLEASE BE AS FRANK AS YOU THINK BEST
ANYHOW IT WOULD TAKE HIM AS LONG TO GET HERE PICK UP THE LOOSE ENDS AND START OUT RIGHT AS IT WOULD TAKE ME TO FINISH MO SO COLONEL VOICED SHAG
HE HAD VENTURED TO KEEP IT AFTER DONOVAN HAD SHOWN IT TO HIM READY TO MAKE SOME PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE IF IT WAS CALLED FOR BUT THE ARREST OF THE EAST INDIAN AND THE PREPARATION OF THE CASE FOR TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE EVIDENTLY MADE DONOVAN FORGET FOR THE TIME BEING THAT THE WATCH WAS NOT AMONG OTHER CRIMINAL RELICS IN HIS CLOSET
MOST PEOPLE LIKED HER SO I'VE HEARD
I DIDN'T EXACTLY HEAR ANYTHING
YES I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
MY ADVISE TO YOU IS TO GET OUT OF TOWN BEFORE I MAY GET INTO THIS THING AGAINST MY WILL
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
HELLO
THE BONDS SHE EXCLAIMED
THEN WHEN HE READ ABOUT THE MURDER AND FOUND HOW--HOW CLOSE HOME IT CAME TO ME HE HURRIED OUT TO OUR PLACE AND SAID I SHOULD ENGAGE YOU TO HELP HE'S THE BIGGEST DETECTIVE IN NEW YORK BROKE IN TOM
I AM ONLY MAKING IT THUS BALD THAT YOU MAY KNOW AND FACE THE WORST I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THANK YOU
IF YOU KNEW WHAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW JIMMIE BOY
WELL WILL THIS NEVER END
AND AFTER THIS MANNER YOU MAY CATCH A TROUT IN A HOT EVENING
AND HERE'S A CROWD OUTSIDE ALREADY THERE WAS ONE--MADE UP OF MEN AND BOYS WITH HERE AND THERE A FACTORY GIRL ON HER WAY TO WORK
DID IT MEAN A VISITOR FOR ANY OF THEM
SUPPOSE WE WALK UP ON THE HEIGHTS SUGGESTED THE MAN
YOU CAN RELY ON HIM
WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU THE RIGHT OF THE LAW WAS THE QUIET ANSWER
MAN COMES IN GET LI'L PRESHENT FOR HIS WIFE--WIFE SITS UP ALL NIGHT WAITIN'--SHE'S TITLED TO LI'L PRESHENT
BUT WENT ON THE DETECTIVE SINCE THE FINDING OF THE ELECTRIC WIRES RUNNING TO DARCY'S DESK--JACK I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
THE PRETTY GIRLS AND THEIR WELL-GROOMED COMPANIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY BALL SET LIKED TO STOP IN THERE FOR THEIR RINGS BROOCHES SCARF PINS OR CUFF LINKS AND VERY FREQUENT WERE THE RATHER LANGUID ORDERS
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SOME ONE CALLED
BUT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE CROAKED THE OLD LADY
CHAPTER X THE DEATH WATCH DOCTOR WARREN THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN STOPPING IN AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS AS HE OFTEN DID ON RETURNING FROM HIS ROUND OF PRIVATE VISITS TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY OFFICIAL CALLS FOR HIM ENCOUNTERED DETECTIVE CARROLL
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN
I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL BE AGAINST YOUR MAN MR FUSSELL BUT THERE'LL BE A CHARGE MADE ALL RIGHT IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT BOTH SUSPECTED MEN PROTESTED THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE KILLING
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT
IT'S WORTH SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS--A SMALL FORTUNE MAYBE--AND SOME OF THE STONES MAY BE LOOSE
DARCY STARED AT THE KEEN KNIFE AND THEN AT THE DEAD WOMAN
MRS DARCY ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND HAD FURTHER CATERED TO IT SO THAT THE DARCY ESTABLISHMENT THOUGH IT WAS NOT THE RICHEST OR MOST SHOWY IN COLCHESTER WAS SAFELY COUNTED THE MOST EXCLUSIVE--THAT IS IT HAD A FULL LINE OF THE BEST GOODS BE IT CLOCKS OR DIAMONDS AND IT HAD WHAT IN BYGONE DAYS WAS CALLED A CARRIAGE TRADE BUT WHICH IS NOW REFERRED TO AS AUTOMOBILE THAT IS TO SAY THOSE ASIDE FROM A CASUAL TRADE WITH PEOPLE WHO DROPPED IN AS THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO A GROCERY TO GET WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED IN THE WAY OF JEWELRY CAME IN GASOLENE OR ELECTRIC CARS WHERE THEIR ANCESTORS HAD COME WITH HORSES AND CARRIAGE
DARCY NEVER COULD HAVE GOT POSSESSION OF ANY TO SAY NOTHING OF SOME OF THE OTHER PARTS USED FOLLOWING SOME DAYS OF STRENUOUS WORK AFTER AMY MASON HAD EXPRESSED HER BELIEF IN HER LOVER'S INNOCENCE IN SPITE OF THE FINDING OF THE ELECTRIC WIRES AND HAD URGED THE DETECTIVE TO USE EVERY ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR DARCY THE COLONEL HAD SUMMONED MR KETTRIDGE TO HOLD A SORT OF AUTOPSY OVER THE INDIAN WATCH WHICH WAS STILL IN POSSESSION OF THE OLD DETECTIVE
SALLIE PAGE THE OLD SERVANT OF MRS DARCY HAS JUST BEEN KILLED BY AN ELECTRIC SHOCK IN THE JEWELRY STORE CHAPTER XVIII AMY'S TEST HOWEVER IT WAS NOT QUITE AS BAD AS THAT THOUGH SALLIE PAGE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK AND HAD BEEN NEAR TO DEATH
WELL DAT MAY BE ALL RIGHT FO JUDGE DOLAN WENT ON SHAG SLOWLY RECOVERING FROM HIS FIT OF CHUCKLING BUT MAH MARSTER DON'T WANT NONE OF DAT KIND OF READIN WHY ASKED THE BOY
HE MAY PROVIDE US WITH A CLEW THAT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PROVE DARCY INNOCENT MORE DIRECTLY THAN BY THE INFERENCE OF SINGA PHUT AND DO YOU THINK SINGA PHUT KILLED HIS PARTNER WITH THE WATCH ALSO COLONEL ASKED JACK
LARCH HAD TAKEN OUT THE VALUABLE DIAMONDS FROM THE ORNAMENT AND HAD DISPOSED OF THEM IN SPITE OF WHAT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE JUST BEFORE HIS DEATH TO GET SOME MUCH-NEEDED MONEY
I TOLD YOU THAT DIDN'T I DEED AN YO DID COLONEL THE DETECTIVE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
AGAIN SHE LOOKED BACK DOWN THE FAST-DARKENING STREET AS THOUGH TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS A WAY OF ESCAPE--SOME ONE NEAR ON WHOM SHE COULD RELY
HE WAS TO INHERIT THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE WHEN HE BECAME THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE
NEVER MIND THAT CALL SHAG
HE'S IN THE CELL NEXT TO WHERE THE DAGO WAS
WHY DID SHE TAKE HIM TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER--WHISPERED
HE WAS ONCE A JOCKEY FOR MY FATHER BUT HE GOT HURT--STIFF ARM--AND WE HAD TO GET HIM SOMETHING ELSE TO DO
AS I THINK BACK THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM VERY GOOD
EVERY ONE IN THE PLACE HAD GONE TO BED--THE SLEEPING ROOMS ARE QUITE A DISTANCE FROM THE SHOP
LOOKS LIKE A CASE OF HEART DISEASE
THE ONLY THING GOING IS THAT ONE WATCH
POOR LITTLE DOG
DO YOU MEAN THAT HE'S DEAD SURE WAS THE ANSWER
THOSE WERE NEVER MY WIRES IN THE SHOWCASE CRIED THE YOUNG MAN
AH GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WARREN
WE WANT TO SEE THAT DAGO YOU KNOW--SINGA PHUT SAID DONOVAN AS HE NODDED TO THE DEPUTY WARDEN WHO ANSWERED THEIR RING AT THE STEEL SIDE DOOR
OH MAH GOOD LORD
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM MR BLAND FOR I LOVED CHET ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DID I KNOW--I KNOW
I CAN'T COVER EM UP
I DON'T QUITE TUMBLE BUT I TAKE IT YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOIN T LET ME GO THAT'S IT SPOTTY
IF THERE IS AS I SAID IT CAN'T BE MUCH
ALL THE AFTERNOON I GUESS AND IT LOOKS AS IF IT WOULD BE ALL NIGHT SO IT DOES
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE AS SOON AS I CAN
I SHOULD SAY NOT THEN HOW DID YOU GET THAT DIAMOND CROSS
LARCH WAS INSISTENT IN HIS DEMANDS AND TRIED TO TAKE THE DIAMOND CROSS FROM MRS DARCY
NICE CRISP DAY--IF YOU SAY IT QUICK CRIED THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN AS HE SHOOK THE RAIN FROM HIS COAT AND TOSSED HIS AUTO GLOVES ON A SHINY GLASS SHOWCASE
NOW CHEER UP
DALEY WAS DOWN IN THE JEWELRY STORE INTERVIEWING THE CLERKS WHILE DARCY WAS ON THE GRILL UP ABOVE
AND SO AM I AMY
WELL I GUESS YOU'VE TOLD ME ALL I WANT TO KNOW
I MIGHT HAVE TELEPHONED FOR MISS BRILL BUT I DIDN'T LIKE TO BRING HER BACK AS SHE'D WORKED HARD ALL DAY
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU AWAKEN IN THE NIGHT AND HEAR THE STROKES YOU CAN'T BE SURE YOU HAVEN'T MISSED SOME OF THE FIRST ONES
BUSTED HIS HEAD IN WITH A HEAVY CANDLESTICK--ONE OF A PAIR
I WAS JUST INTERESTED AS SINGA PHUT WAS ONE CONCERNED IN MRS DARCY'S MURDER BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT AND CARROLL POINTED TO THE HEADQUARTERS CAT WHICH WAS SLEEPING NEAR A RADIATOR FOR THE DAY HAD TURNED COLD AND STEAM WAS ON IN THE PLACE
SOME OF HIS WIRES THAT HE RIGGED UP FOR HIS ELECTRIC LATHE SECRETLY DID GET TANGLED WITH THE HEAVILY-CHARGED CONDUCTORS OF THE LIGHTING SYSTEM THOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT
I AM ONLY SUGGESTING POSSIBILITIES BUT GREAT SCOTT COLONEL--SHERE ALI WAS KILLED IN THE SAME WAY
I WONDER THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND SHAG ENTERED BOWING AND SALUTING MILITARY STYLE AT THE SAME TIME
IT WAS A DRIZZLE
BESIDES HE WENT ON KEDGE WOULD ONLY MIX MATTERS UP NOW
SAY DOES HE WANT A BOOK--A PAPER
AS FOR STYLE NEITHER MISS MASON NOR I CARE FOR IT
HE CRUSHED THE PAPER IN HIS HAND AND THEN SPREAD IT OUT TO READ AGAIN THE STARTLING NEWS WHILE HE MURMURED
OR PERHAPS HE HAD RUN SHORT OF MONEY WHEN PLAYING CARDS AND HAVE GONE TO MRS DARCY'S STORE TO BORROW OR SEE IF HE COULD NOT GET SOMETHING ON WHICH HE MIGHT RAISE CASH
AS THE WOMAN WALKED ON SHE TURNED NOW AND THEN AND LOOKED BACK ALONG THE FAST-DARKENING STREETS
THERE--YOU CALLED DARCY HOARSELY
HE'S A SPORT--IN HIS OWN WAY YES AGREED THE COLONEL ONE POINT PUZZLES ME WENT ON MR MASON AND THAT IS WHY CYNTHIA--I CALL HER THAT FOR I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS--WHY SHE DIDN'T MAKE LARCH SUPPORT HER AFTER THE SEPARATION
ANY QUEER NOISE
THERE WERE THE FEW POOR POSSESSIONS HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE WITH HIM--SIMPLE AND APPARENTLY SAFE ENOUGH
THE GLISTENING ASPHALT THE GLEAMING TROLLEY RAILS THE DARK AND DAMP BUILDINGS SEEMED TO ECHO BACK HIS WORDS
WE'D BETTER MAKE SURE BEFORE WE TELEPHONE FOR THE POLICE
I WAS GETTING READY FOR IT AFTER THE CLERKS HAD GONE--SETTING OUT THE DISPLAY AND THE LIKE--WHEN I FOUND I NEEDED HELP
BUT WE DIDN'T LET HIM FURTHER THAN THE CORRIDOR
THE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM NO
ALL THE DECENT CROWD STOPPED COMING YES I SUPPOSE SO AGREED THE COLONEL
HE MAY BE IN ANY TIME NOW AND I HAVEN'T IT READY FOR HIM WHAT SORT OF A REPAIR JOB ASKED CARROLL
HE'LL STICK BY JIMMIE THROUGH THICK AND THIN FOR HE SAYS HE KNOWS HE'S INNOCENT AND YOURSELF
NOW JUST KEEP QUIET AND LISTEN THEREUPON AMY WENT ON TO RELATE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN SHE SOUGHT OUT THE FISHERMAN AT THE TROUT BROOK--HOW SHE HAD BEEN CARED FOR BY HIM AND SHAG AFTER HER FAINT AND HOW AFTER SOME PERSUASION THE GREAT DETECTIVE HAD AGREED TO TAKE UP THE MATTER OF SEEKING OUT THE REAL MURDERER OF MRS DARCY
HE MUST NEVER SUSPECT AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THAT I HAVE BEEN IN COLCHESTER NEXT TO THE ELEVATOR IN WHICH AARON GRAFTON RODE UP WAS ANOTHER
KNOWING THAT TO START ANEW IN A STRANGE TOWN WOULD MEAN UPHILL WORK FOR HIM AND HIS WIFE MORTIMER DARCY HAD AWAITED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THE BUSINESS OF A MAN WHOM HE HAD KNOWN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND TO WHOM HE HAD SOLD MANY DIAMONDS AND OTHER STONES
GOING YET--SEE AND HE HELD IT OUT TO COLONEL ASHLEY
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE DOG SUFFER DO YOU NO BUT--THERE HE'S GOT IT OUT HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT THE DOG HAD PAWED FROM HIS MOUTH THE WATCH WHICH BEING RATHER LARGE AND OF PECULIAR SHAPE HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN STUCK IN HIS JAWS
YES MURMURED THE COLONEL AS HE SANK INTO HIS SEAT I THINK I'LL BRING HOME THE BIG FISH THIS TIME CHAPTER XXI SWIRLING WATERS AT THE LITTLE STATION OF POMPEY THE COLONEL SAW HIS MAN LEAVE THE TRAIN
NOT THAT ORDINARILY I'M SATISFIED WITH ONE BUT I'M NOT WORKING THE ROD NOW
AND IS THE COLONEL REALLY GOING TO TAKE MY CASE REALLY AND TRULY
I WAS TO MAKE ONE LITTLE ADJUSTMENT IN IT FOR HIM AND HE WAS TO COME IN EARLY TO GET IT
HE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO EVEN IF I TOLD HIM
IT'S MR YOUNG COLONEL IS IT
I MUST SEE WHAT FRIEND AARON IS UP TO AND WHAT HIS LITTLE GAME IS
I WANT TO TELL THE POLICE
WHERE WERE YOU--WHAT DID YOU DO WHAT I DID HE BLINKED HIS EYES RAPIDLY TO RID THEM OF THE WATER WHICH POURED FORTH IN AN EFFORT TO ASSUAGE THEIR DRINK-INFLAMED CONDITION AND REGARDED THOSE ABOUT HIM WITH HALF-DRUNKEN GRAVITY
I JUST HAD A TELEGRAM FROM HER AND I AM GOING TO SEE HER NOW TO LEARN THE PARTICULARS WENT ON AARON GRAFTON
HE HAD THE TICKING WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HIS HEAD WAS SMASHED IN YES AND OF COURSE HE MAY HAVE BEEN STRUCK ON HIS HEAD AFTER HE DIED FROM THE POISONED WATCH EXACTLY AND THIS WATCH DARCY HAD IN HIS POSSESSION TO REPAIR JUST BEFORE MRS DARCY WAS FOUND DEAD AND SHE HAD IT IN HER HAND AND--SAY COLONEL WHERE ARE WE AT AND JACK YOUNG LOOKED HOPELESSLY AT HIS CHIEF
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING--MUCH
HELLO HE SAID INTO THE TRANSMITTER
HARRY WAS ONLY HELD AS A WITNESS SO FAR BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE AND BECAUSE OF HIS KNOWN CHARACTERISTIC OF SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING AT TIMES A HEAVY BOND HAD BEEN REQUIRED
IT MAY BE SOME ONE I DON'T CARE TO TALK TO NOW
AMY AND HIS EYES FLOWED
IT'S MIGHTY FUNNY IF THERE WAS MURDER DONE AND NO ROBBERY
LET US KEEP TO THE SUBJECT
NOT THAT I'M LIKELY TO FOR I NEVER HEARD OF BEING SCRATCHED BY A WATCH BUT WHY NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE DOORMAN OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS STUCK HIS HEAD IN SCOTLAND YARD AS THE PATROLMEN DESIGNATED THE INNER SANCTUM WHERE THE DETECTIVES HAD THEIR ROOMS AND CALLED
E-TEXT PREPARED BY AL HAINES THE DIAMOND CROSS BEING A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT DETECTIVE STORY BY CHESTER K
SHE CONTINUED HIS BUSINESS
LIGHTLY AS A FALLING FEATHER THE FISHERMAN LET HIS FLY COME TO REST ON THE SUN-LIT WATER AND HARDLY HAD IT SENT THE FIRST FEW FAINT RIPPLES CIRCLING TOWARD SHORE THAN THERE WAS A SHRILL SONG OF THE REEL AND THE ROD BECAME A BENT BOW
IT WAS NOT LONG IN BEING PLAYED
WE'VE GOT TO PROVE JAMES DARCY INNOCENT BY ESTABLISHING THE FACT THAT SOME ONE ELSE KILLED HIS COUSIN EXACTLY
JUDGE DOLAN--HE RIDES ON MY TRAIN A LOT--AND HE'S ALWAYS ASKIN WHAT I GOT NEW IN DETECTIVE STUFF UM YEP
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD GONE TO A CLOSET AND TAKEN FROM IT A PACKAGE WHICH HE PLACED ON A TABARETTE ON WHICH NEAR HIM RESTED A BOX OF CIGARS THAT HE SPOKE
WHEN I HAD DAMAGED THE CROSS BY STEPPING ON IT I THOUGHT MY OLD FRIEND MRS DARCY WOULD BE THE BEST ONE TO KEEP MY SECRET
WELL COLONEL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SAID JACK AFTER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS I'D HAVE TO SEE THE PLACE TO GET AT ANY RIGHT IDEA OF IT
HE DOESN'T HOLD HIMSELF SO HIGHLY AND IT'S TELLING ON HIS BUSINESS WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT A NUMBER OF HIS BEST FRIENDS ARE LEAVING HIM
I KNOWS YOU AIN'T ADMITTED SHAG
I'LL FORGIVE YOU I SUPPOSE
AS A MATTER OF FACT COLONEL ASHLEY HAD HAD IT IN HIS POSSESSION SINCE THAT NIGHT DONOVAN WENT OUT WITH HIS FRIEND THE STOOL PIGEON
YOU MAY OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE FORMED AN OPINION AS TO WHO KILLED HER BUT I JUDGE YOU ARE POSITIVE AS TO HOW SHE WAS KILLED--I MEAN THE NATURE OF THE WOUND THERE WERE TWO WOUNDS YOU KNOW--A FRACTURE OF THE SKULL JUST BACK OF THE RIGHT EAR AND A STAB WOUND IN THE LEFT SIDE WHICH PUNCTURED THE HEART
IT WAS LEFT HERE BY THERE WAS A COMMOTION AT THE SIDE DOOR WHICH HAD BEEN OPENED BY MULLIGAN IN ORDER THAT THE MEN MIGHT CARRY OUT THE BODY OF MRS DARCY
LITTLE FISH
YOU'LL BE SORRY WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED BACK THERE IN COLCHESTER SPOTTY YOU'RE RIGHT FALTERED THE COLONEL
RED AND FRECKLED
THAT'S IT
I--I SHE FALTERED LOOKING FROM SHAG TO THE COLONEL AND THEN TO THE SYMPATHETIC COLORED MAN AGAIN FOR ON HIS FACE WAS A LOOK OF PITY
BUT IT'S FAST BECOMING SOMETHING ELSE NOW
I CAME HERE PREPARED TO PAY ANY REASONABLE AMOUNT AND THE MERCHANT DREW OUT HIS WALLET
NO--NO--NOT EXACTLY I DID HEAR SOMETHING_--IT WASN'T EXACTLY A NOISE--AND YET IT WAS A NOISE WHAT KIND OF TALK IS THAT DEMANDED THONG ROUGHLY
THERE WAS SILENCE AFTER THIS AND DARCY LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET
AND CHET THE DOG IN QUESTION WAS RATHER PROUD OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT
COME HERE SOMEBODY
I'LL LET HIM WORK OUT THE REST OF THE PROBLEMS
SINGA PHUT IS A QUIET STUDIOUS INDIAN ANSWERED DARCY
I HAD FORGOTTEN
THERE WAS AN ELECTRIC LIGHT SOCKET IN EACH CELL--RECENTLY INSTALLED AS THE RESULT OF THE AGITATION OF A PRISON REFORM COMMITTEE
HE TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT PRESS THE CHARGE AGAINST SPOTTY FOR STEALING THE IMITATION DIAMOND CROSS
YOU'RE THE DETECTIVE AREN'T YOU WELL--ER--I--SAY RATHER A DETECTIVE FOR THERE ARE MANY AND I AM ONLY ONE BUT YOU ARE THE ONE FROM NEW YORK I AM THOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUESSED IT
I WISH I'D NEVER GOTTEN INTO THIS MESS BUT I CAN'T GET OUT NOW
NEVER MIND ME
KING REGARDED HIS QUESTIONER GRAVELY AS THOUGH DEEPLY PONDERING OVER THE MATTER
AND MORTIMER DARCY KNOWING THE VALUE OF THAT CLASS OF TRADE HAD WHEN HE PURCHASED MR VAN DOREN'S BUSINESS FOSTERED THAT SPIRIT
OF COURSE AS I SAID EITHER BLOW COULD HAVE CAUSED DEATH BUT BLOWS ON THE HEAD EVEN WHEN THE SKULL IS BADLY FRACTURED AS IN THIS CASE DO NOT INVARIABLY CAUSE DEATH INSTANTLY
IS SHE IN ANY DANGER COLONEL I BELIEVE NOT THAT'S GOOD
YOU GOT PEARL'S NAME GRAVED ON IT DARCY OLE MAN ASKED KING THICKLY LICKING HIS HOT AND FEVERISH LIPS
AN INFERNAL MACHINE IN A WATCH NOT EXACTLY AN INFERNAL MACHINE BUT A POISONED NEEDLE WHICH ONLY REQUIRED PRESSURE ON THE RIM OF THE CASE TO SHOOT IT OUT INTO THE HAND OR WHATEVER PART OF A PERSON OR ANIMAL WAS NEAR IT
WELL IT'S A QUEER WORLD ANYHOW ISN'T IT AGREED THE COLONEL
WHAT D'YOU MEAN
WHO IN THE NAME OF ALL THE DEVILS IN HADES ARE YOU HE CRIED
HE IS AN INTERESTING STUDY
I REMEMBER IN THE PEAL CASE TWO STRONG AND VIGOROUS MEN BATTLED AT MIDNIGHT ONE KILLING THE OTHER IN A STORE ON A MAIN STREET IN A BIG CITY
AMY EXCLAIMED DARCY AS HE WAS ALLOWED TO STEP OUT INTO THE ANTEROOM CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A KEEPER WHILE A DETECTIVE FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE STOOD NEAR
BUT WE DETECTIVES ARE USED TO ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATIONS AND MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN
AS FOR THE BONDS YOU'LL NEVER TOUCH THEM SHE CRIED BITTERLY
I HAD COME DOWN TO THE STORE EARLY TO DO A LITTLE REPAIR JOB AND THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS--HER WHAT TIME DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT
I GUESS THAT'S ALL NOW THEY LET THE YOUNG MAN GO BACK TO HIS ROOM IN POLICE HEADQUARTERS
HOW'D IT HAPPEN HE ASKED AS HE CAME BACK FROM THE INSTRUMENT AND LEANED AGAINST A SHOWCASE CONTAINING MUCH GLITTERING SILVER
MORE REPORTERS CAME AND DALEY FRATERNIZED WITH THEM THE NEWSPAPER MEN ASIDE FROM THE POLICE AND JIM HOLIDAY A DETECTIVE FROM PROSECUTOR BARDON'S OFFICE BEING THE ONLY PEOPLE ADMITTED TO THE SHOP WHEN THE CLERKS HAD BEEN SENT HOME
GUESS YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME
YOU WERE RIGHT SAID DOCTOR WARREN IT WAS POISON
HE DID I GUESS NO HE IS STILL IN TOWN SAID COLONEL ASHLEY
OF COURSE HE MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE STORE THE DAY OF THE MURDER--BEFORE I ARRIVED
I WANT TO KNOW WHO KILLED MRS DARCY AND WHERE YOU GOT THAT CROSS
COME HE DID NOT OFFER TO TOUCH HER NOR DID HE TURN HIS HEAD MORE THAN HALF WAY IN SPEAKING TO HER
QUEER HE'D WASTE EM THAT WAY OBSERVED DONOVAN
THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS FATAL WITHIN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME--A MINUTE OR TWO
YES I THINK I MUST SEE KETTRIDGE ONCE MORE THE COLONEL STARTED TOWARD HIS ROOM TELEPHONE INTENDING TO SUMMON THE JEWELER WHO WAS LIVING OVER THE STORE IN MRS DARCY'S ROOMS
THEN THE DOG PLAYING WITH IT AS HE WOULD WITH A BONE BIT ON THE RIM JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE NEEDLE WAS SET TO OPERATE
THAT'LL CRACK A SKULL BUT IT WON'T DRAW BLOOD--NOT IF IT'S USED RIGHT AND HE BROUGHT FROM HIS HIP POCKET ONE OF THE WEAPONS IN QUESTION--A SHORT STOUT FLEXIBLE REED COVERED WITH LEATHER THE END FORMING A POCKET IN WHICH WAS A CHUNK OF LEAD
IN THE OTHER HAND WAS THE DIAMOND CROSS
I BELIEVE IN TURNING THE TABLES AND THOUGH I CAN'T DO FOR YOU WHAT YOU DID FOR ME MAYBE I CAN HELP IN A WAY YOU KIN GAMBLE ON THAT COLONEL LISTEN TO ME SPOTTY AND THE DETECTIVE LEANED FORWARD AND SPOKE IN A LOW TENSE VOICE
BUT I WON'T CHANCE THAT YET
I SUPPOSE THE DETECTIVES HAVE IT THE PROSECUTOR DID TAKE IT BUT SINGA PHUT HAS IT NOW HE HAS CRIED DARCY
I THINK I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIM MUSED THE COLONEL
TALK ABOUT A DIAMOND CROSS THERE MAY BE A DOUBLE-CROSS IN IT ON THE PART OF GRAFTON
YOU WOULDN'T I'M SURE AND THE GIRL SMILED THROUGH THE TEARS IN HER BLUE EYES
WHAT'S THAT
THEN TO GET TO THE MORE PERSONAL PROBLEM DID EITHER KING OR DARCY COMMIT THE MURDER AND IF SO WHY
HA
HA
NOBODY OF COURSE NOT
BUT I NEVER STRUNG THOSE WIRES TO SHOCK HER AND OF COURSE YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE I NEVER COULD PLAN TO INJURE SALLIE PAGE THAT WAY OR THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN THE OTHER DAY WELL DARCY YOU MAY BE TELLING THE TRUTH AND AGAIN YOU MAY NOT AND THE COLONEL'S VOICE WAS AS NONCOMMITTAL AS POSSIBLE
THERE WAS A BRISKER STEP ALONG THE FLAGGED CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF THE CELLS OF MURDERERS ROW HALF A DOZEN MEN AND ONE WOMAN AGAINST WHOM SUCH A CHARGE HAD BEEN MADE--DARCY AMONG THEM--LOOKED UP WITH AN INTEREST THEY HAD NOT SHOWN BEFORE
I GUESS YOU REMEMBER THAT MURRAY CASE HE WENT ON TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR
THEN LEANING TOWARD THE NEWSBOY AND WHISPERING THE NEGRO SAID
COULD NOT HE HAVE BOTH STRUCK MRS DARCY WITH THE HUNTER STATUE AND STABBED HER IN TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM HER
THEN WHEN I HAD LOOKED OVER THE GROUND AND TALKED WITH MISS MASON AND HIM I WAS WILLING TO TAKE UP HIS CASE JUST BECAUSE I BELIEVED HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE COLONEL WHO HAD TAKEN THE WATCH FROM SOME TISSUE PAPER IN WHICH IT WAS WRAPPED LAID IT DOWN ON THE LOW STOOL AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO HIS VISITOR
LET YOUR BAIT BE AS BIG A RED WORM AS YOU CAN FIND SPOTTY IS CERTAINLY RED MUSED THE FISHERMAN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AND THERE'S NO USE PRETENDING THAT I DO
WE'LL LET YOU IN FOR ANYTHING THAT'S GOING AS SOON AS WE CAN--YOU KNOW THAT SURE AGREED DALEY
HE WAS BEGINNING TO PLACE THE LAD
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED
THE OLD PLACE HAS GONE TO THE BOW-WOWS SINCE HE STARTED DRINKING GAMBLING SPECULATING AND SINCE HIS WIFE LEFT HIM
AARON GRAFTON STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR
I DON'T WANT TO SEEM HARSH OR IMPOLITE BUT I CAN'T NOT EVEN FOR DOUBLE YOUR USUAL FEE
WHO ARE YOU
COLONEL ASHLEY SPENT TWO BUSY DAYS MOST OF HIS TIME BEING GIVEN OVER TO INVESTIGATING AARON GRAFTON
BUT THE SEPARATION OF MR AND MRS LARCH WAS DIFFERENT
IF YOU DON'T YOU MAY GET INTO TROUBLE
THE CROWD BEGAN TO SURGE INTO THE ALLEY WHENCE A SIDE DOOR GAVE ENTRANCE INTO MRS DARCY'S PLACE
SHE MAY ONLY HAVE FALLEN AND CUT HER HEAD YOU--YOU GO AND SEE SUGGESTED TREMLAIN
I'LL ATTEND TO HER MYSELF
AND THAT SINGA PHUT WAS GUILTY OF HAVING KILLED HIS PARTNER IN A SUDDEN FIT OF PASSION FOLLOWING ONE OF THEIR FREQUENT QUARRELS WAS ALSO BELIEVED BY THOSE WHO CARED TO EXERCISE ANY THOUGHT IN THE MATTER
OF COURSE--AS IS USUAL IN A DIVORCE CASE
ARE YOU IN CONDITION TO TALK NOT HERE INTERRUPTED THONG QUICKLY WITH A GLANCE AT THE NEWSPAPER MEN WHICH THEY WERE QUICK TO INTERPRET
AND I'D GIVE HALF MY FORTUNE TO GET IT BACK
HOW'S THE WEATHER SHAG WELL SAH COLONEL IT'S--IT'S SORTER--MOIST COLONEL UM
RATHER MORE THAN A REPAIR MAN AND CLERK WAS JAMES DARCY
I WANT TO TELL JIMMIE THAT SOMETHING IS BEING DONE FOR HIM
I THOUGHT THAT NOT A SOUL BUT I KNEW IT
YOU MEAN THAT I I DON'T MEAN NOTHIN BROKE IN MULLIGAN
YOU'LL SEE WELL IT'S YOUR BUSINESS OF COURSE--YOURS AND THAT OF THE PROSECUTOR--TO PROVE HIM GUILTY SAID THE COLONEL
SUICIDE IS OF COURSE THE MOST NATURAL SUSPICION IN A CASE LIKE THIS AND IT ISN'T HARD TO CONCEAL ENOUGH OPIUM IN A CIGARETTE TO KILL A DOZEN MEN BLAZES
IT WAS PROBABLY MARKED IN SOME SECRET WAY
IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL SOME TRUTH AND HONOR IN THE WORLD AND THAT A MAN AND WOMAN CAN BE FRIENDS THOUGH THE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM PECULIAR HE PAUSED A MOMENT TO OVERCOME HIS EMOTION AND RESUMED
IT WAS NOT HER HEART
WHAT IS YOUR THEORY I HAVE SO MANY I DON'T KNOW AT WHICH ONE TO BEGIN ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
IT DIDN'T GET IN THIS MORNING'S PAPERS BUT IT WILL BE IN THIS AFTERNOON'S I WISH YOU COULD SEE HER AND EXPLAIN
IT'S TOO LATE FOR FISHING NOW OBSERVED THE BOY AS UNWITTINGLY HE HANDED OVER THE MISSIVE
AND IF I HAD EVEN DREAMED THAT YOUR DOG WOULD TAKE IT OFF THE STOOL TO WORRY IT AS HE MIGHT A BONE I'D NEVER HAVE LET HIM IN HERE SAID THE DETECTIVE
ANYHOW THEY BROUGHT QUITE A SUM OF MONEY
BUT I HAVE A FEW THINGS I WANT TO SAY TO YOU AND I DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE VILLAGE BABBLING ABOUT IT
I SHOULD SAY NOT
I WAS ONLY A STRUGGLING CLERK THEN AND NEVER DREAMED I WOULD GET ON AS I HAVE
I HAVE SOME THEORIES I WANT TO WORK ON AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY'LL TURN OUT I S'POSE YOU THINK DARCY DIDN'T DO THIS JOB CUT IN CARROLL RATHER SNEERINGLY
GRAFTON'S SEARCH VII
AND LASTLY I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING LIVELIER IN THE WAY OF READING SIR IF YOU WISH IT BROKE IN THE VOICE OF THE NEWSBOY WHO HAD STOPPED BESIDE THE PARLOR-CAR CHAIR OF THE MILITARY-LOOKING TRAVELER INTERRUPTING THE READING OF THE LITTLE GREEN-COVERED BOOK
IF HE WAS THE COLONEL DID NOT FINISH
SHAG YOU RASCAL LOOK HERE
HOW YOU GOING TO GET AT HIM COLONEL ASKED THE WARDEN
AND NOW JIMMIE FOR THE GOOD NEWS
FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO DID THE KILLING AND THE ONLY REASON I SAID WE OUGHT TO ARREST HARRY KING IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME GAME ON BETWEEN HIM AND LARCH AND THOSE DIAMONDS KING IS TRYING TO DISPOSE OF MAY BE PART OF SOME OF THOSE MRS DARCY HAD AND ABOUT WHICH SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
SHAG LOOKED TIMIDLY AT HIS MASTER
IF KING TOOK THEM HE MAY HAVE KILLED THE OLD LADY AND HE OUGHT TO BE LOCKED UP AND TAKE HIS CHANCE WITH DARCY IF HE DID IT--YES ADMITTED THE COLONEL
HUNTING IS A GAME FOR PRINCES AND NOBLE PERSONS
SUCH AT LEAST WAS A THEORY AND ONE SEVERAL TOOK STOCK IN
IT WASN'T VISITING DAY FOR THE FELLOWS IN HIS ROW SO THE DAGO LEFT A PACKAGE AND WENT AWAY WHAT WAS IN THE PACKAGE THE COLONEL QUESTIONED FURTHER
IN ANY CASE HE MUST REMAIN IN JAIL
BUT DO YOU THINK COLONEL IN SPITE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID ABOUT JIMMIE NOT KNOWING HOW THIS WATCH OPERATED AND PRESUMABLY NOT HAVING DONE ANY WORK ON IT--DO YOU THINK HE CAN HAVE PLANNED TO KILL MRS DARCY WITH IT HARDLY
CHAPTER VI GRAFTON'S SEARCH THE FUNERAL OF MRS DARCY HAD BEEN HELD ATTENDED AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BY A LARGE THRONG OF THE MERELY CURIOUS AS WELL AS BY SOME OF HER DISTANT KINSFOLK FOR SHE HAD FEW NEAR ONES
AH THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE PHILOSOPHY OF MY FRIEND IZAAK WALTON
SHE DID NOT RAISE THE MESH
THEN HE LOOKED UP AT SHAG AND REMARKED
THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED MORE SLOWLY UNTIL HE REACHED THE COLLECTION OF HOUSES AND THERE HE STROLLED ALONG INSPECTING THE DIFFERENT DWELLINGS AS THOUGH ATTRACTED BY THE QUAINT OLD VILLAGE STREET
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT I REASONED SO YES IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE CURTAIN SAID THONG SLOWLY
AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T BELIEVE JIMMIE DID ANY REPAIR WORK ON IT AT ALL
BUT THEY CAN BE SUPPLIED WITH CURRENT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE IT SEEMS AND I WAS THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF DOING IT YOU
DON'T WHAT ASKED THE PHYSICIAN SHARPLY
DEN I S'PECTS YO'LL WANT T GIT GET EVERYTHING READY YES
THE DOCTOR ROLLED UP HIS SHIRT SLEEVES AND STOOPED DOWN
WHAT'S THAT WALTON SAYS ABOUT MAN PROPOSING AND PROVIDENCE DISPOSING
AS IT HAPPENED AARON GRAFTON WAS CALLING ON HER AT THE TIME TRYING TO FIND SOME MEANS OF HELPING HER FOR THERE IS THE OLD-TIME LOVE BETWEEN THEM
I'M DESPERATE
THEN CAME THE MATTER OF ALIMONY OR RATHER I SHOULD CALL IT SEPARATE MAINTENANCE AS IT IS NOT ALIMONY UNTIL A DIVORCE IS GRANTED AND THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE THOUGH WE MAY APPLY FOR THAT LATER
TOM STAYED AT OUR HOUSE AT POMPEY ALL NIGHT
BUT FATE IN THE PERSON OF A SMALL BOY HAD JUST A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE DROPPED A BANANA SKIN ON THE STREETS
GOT TAKE HER HOME SOME--SOMESHING--SQUARE MYSELF
I WANT TO BE WITH HIM WHERE'S YOUR HOOKS AND LINE ASKED THE BOY
THIS WATCH IS OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
NOW YOU DARE ASK ME FOR THEM AGAIN I DO AND I'M GOING TO ENFORCE MY DEMANDS
OR AT ANY RATE HE WAS SOMEWHAT IDLY USING A ROD AND LINE TO AID HIM IN HIS THOUGHTS
HE'LL BE SO TICKLED TO GET OUT OF PAYING HIS WIFE A MONTHLY SUM THAT HE'LL SETTLE WITH ME
IT WAS NOT EVERY DAY THEY COULD BE SO CLOSE TO A MURDER
GOD KNOWS FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY NAME I'D LIKE TO SEE DARCY CLEARED
NOT TO CAST ANY ASPERSIONS ON YOUR ABILITY AS AN ARTIST I CAN'T JUST MAKE OUT HOW THE WIRES RUN FROM THIS SKETCH AND HE SMILED AFTER HAVING STUDIED THE DRAWINGS FOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES
I'LL CALL HER
HANG SPOTTY ANYHOW
RILEY WAS SAYING SOME ONE LET OUT A YELL THAT WAS SCHMIDT--FELLOW THAT KILLED HIS WIFE INTERPOSED THE DEPUTY WARDEN
NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SAY I'VE CAUGHT SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHUBB AH I THOUGHT I WASN'T MISTAKEN IN THINKING YOU A PUPIL IN THE SCHOOL OF IZAAK WALTON ISAAC WALTON
I WILL KEEP THAT NAME FOR THE PRESENT
I LAY STILL A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN I WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
AARON GRAFTON TURNED A DEEP RED AND BIT HIS LIPS
SPOTTY'S PAL FOOLED HIM
HOW ABOUT IT SPOTTY MORGAN HESITATED A MOMENT NODDED SILENTLY AND THEN ARM IN ARM WITH THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PULLED FROM THE PATH OF THE BIG TRUCK WENT DOWN THE STREET THE MIST AND RAIN SWALLOWING THEM UP
DO YOU WANT HIM DO I WANT HIM FAIRLY YELLED THE COLONEL
CHAPTER II KING'S DAGGER CARROLL AND THONG PROCEEDING ALONG THE LINES THEY USUALLY FOLLOWED IN CASES LIKE THIS KEEPING TO THE RULES WHICH HAD COME TO THEM THROUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SUPERIOR OFFICERS AND SOME WHICH THEY HAD WORKED OUT FOR THEMSELVES HAD IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME ASCERTAINED THE NAME AGE AND SOMEWHAT OF THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF MRS AMELIA DARCY TOGETHER WITH THAT OF HER COUSIN AS THE DETECTIVES CALLED HIM THOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT AS CLOSE AS THAT
I'LL TELEGRAPH FOR ONE OF MY BEST MEN
YOU DIDN'T EXAGGERATE WHEN YOU SPOKE OF YOUR TROUT STREAM I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT
KEDGE WOULD BE SURE TO SPOIL IT AFTER I'VE STARTED THINGS MOVING
AND THERE'S ANOTHER ANGLE TO IT WHAT'S THAT JACK WELL THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK BETWEEN LARCH AND KING ABOUT SOME BIG DIAMONDS THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD OF LATE
WHEW WHISPERED THE FOLLOWER OF IZAAK WALTON I WONDER IF HE CAME HERE TO CONSULT MY AGENCY ALL DOUBTS WERE DISSOLVED A MOMENT LATER WHEN KEEPING SOMEWHAT IN THE BACKGROUND THE DETECTIVE HEARD THE MERCHANT ASK THE ELEVATOR STARTER ON WHICH FLOOR WERE THE OFFICES OF COLONEL ASHLEY'S DETECTIVE AGENCY
WHY JIMMIE WOULDN'T HAVE CAUSED MRS DARCY A MOMENT OF PAIN TO SAY NOTHING OF STRIKING HER--KILLING HER
HE'S SOLVED MORE CASES LIKE THIS THAN I CAN REMEMBER
THE CLOCK OVER DARCY'S WORK TABLE NOTED THE HOUR OF 7:56
TICK-TICK THE SOUND SEEMED TO GROW LOUDER
I WISH I HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOES I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT
AND I KNOW THAT A WEEK PREVIOUS TO THAT SHE HAD REFUSED A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE
ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE RUINED MY LIFE
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER PUT UP AT THE HOMESTEAD I WILL THOUGH I GUESS IT WON'T BE THE HOMESTEAD LONG WHY NOT WELL LARCH IS GOING TO LOSE IT I HEAR
I SUPPOSE KEDGE IS VERY BUSY NOW WELL YES SAH I S'PECTS SO
HE HAD CONTINUED THE WORK BEGUN IN THE ARMY--A BRANCH OF THE SECRET SERVICE--AND HAD BUILT UP THE CITY'S DETECTIVE DEPARTMENT IN AN ALMOST MARVELOUS MANNER HE HIMSELF BEING ONE OF ITS KEENEST SLEUTHS
YOU'LL HAVE TO IN FACT
SHE WAS REALLY FORCED INTO THIS MARRIAGE WHICH TO SAY THE LEAST MUST HAVE BEEN DISTASTEFUL TO HER
IT WAS KNOWN THAT KING WAS CONSTANTLY IN DEBT IN SPITE OF HIS ALLOWANCE AND THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL ADVANCES HE RECEIVED FROM TIME TO TIME
I SENT FOR YOU TO HAVE YOU SHADOW KING SAID THE DETECTIVE IN A LOW VOICE SEEING TO IT THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM NOT A CONFESSION SURELY EXCLAIMED YOUNG
WELL COLONEL REMARKED MR MASON AS TOGETHER THEY STROLLED TOWARD A TROUT STREAM SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE CLEARING UP OF THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY I'M GLAD TO KNOW YOU HAD THE SAME FAITH IN YOUNG DARCY THAT I HAD OH YES THERE COULDN'T BE ANY OTHER WAY OUT
I DONE TELL HIM THAT AND IT--IT'S SACRILEGIOUS SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
I MUST SEE HOW YOU ARE MADE INSIDE AND I THINK I'D BETTER HAVE A PROFESSIONAL PERFORM AN AUTOPSY ON YOU
THAT WATCH WAS GOING YES SO YOU TOLD ME--YOU THOUGHT IT WAS HER HEART BEATING I WISH OH HOW I WISH IT HAD BEEN EXCLAIMED DARCY IN TONES OF DESPAIR
I TOLD EM THAT BUT THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME TOO OLD TO GO FISHIN SAH COLONEL
OF COURSE COSTUME PLAYED ITS PART WHEN NEEDED BUT THE TIME HAD NOT YET COME FOR THAT
THE IDEA
BUT WHAT GETS ME THOUGH SAID THE COLONEL IS WHERE DOES SINGA PHUT FIT IN WITH THE WATCH IN MRS DARCY'S HAND
SO DON'T BOTHER HIM
IT IS SOMEWHAT PECULIAR MOST CASES THAT COME TO US ARE AND THE COLONEL SMILED
DAT'S WHUT HE IS AND HIS NAME IS COLONEL BRENTNALL WELL HONEY DAT AIN'T HIS REAL NAME
THE RIGHT OF THE LAW
BUT I REMEMBER IT
YOU DON'T BELIEVE DARCY EVER PUT THAT POISON NEEDLE ARRANGEMENT IN IT NO I DON'T
ONE OF THE RELATIVES WAS SUMMONED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE STORE AND HER OTHER BUSINESS AFFAIRS FOR A FORMAL CHARGE OF MURDER HAVING BEEN MADE AGAINST HIM JAMES DARCY WAS NOT PERMITTED TO ATTEND THE FINAL SERVICES NOR HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO DO WITH THE JEWELRY ESTABLISHMENT
I MAY BE ABLE TO GET A POSTPONEMENT SAID THE LAWYER BUT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE TO COUNT ON IT
THE VOICES KING ADDED WERE THOSE OF MRS DARCY AND HER COUSIN JAMES DARCY AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT A QUARREL WAS IN PROGRESS
COLONEL ASHLEY AT THIS STAGE OF HIS CAREER WAS ALMOST AN INTERNATIONAL FIGURE
STOP IT CRIED THE COLONEL
BUT I HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH MY COUSIN'S DEATH THAN CARROLL OR YOU
I COULD ALMOST HAVE TAKEN MY OATH ON IT CRIED THE EXCITABLE COLONEL
SHE THINKING HIM A THIEF RESISTS AND HE FEARFUL THAT HE WILL BE CAUGHT AND ARRESTED AS A ROBBER STRUGGLES TO GET THE WATCH AND TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
I DO REMEMBER THE ONE KING HAD THOUGH AND I'M SURE SHE NEVER SOLD THAT
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME THOUGH
THIS MAN--HARRISON VAN DOREN BY NAME--HAD WHAT WAS TERMED THE BEST JEWELRY TRADE IN COLCHESTER
I'VE COME TO ASK YOU TO HELP ME--HELP HIM
IS THE DIAMOND CROSS IN HER POSSESSION OR DID GRAFTON SAY THAT SO I'D DROP THE CASE AND--LEAVE HIM OUT OF IT
I NEVER DREAMED IT WAS LIKE AN ALARM CLOCK WELL IT WAS SAID MR KETTRIDGE
BY THE WAY WHAT BECAME OF HIM THE DOCTOR ASKED OF DETECTIVE CARROLL WHO HAD STROLLED OUT OF THE DETECTIVES PRIVATE ROOM AND WAS LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION
I WONDERED WHAT SO PERTURBED YOU BUT NOW I KNOW
SINGA PHUT CRIED BOTH HIS AUDITORS
I HAVE STOPPED THERE ON FISHING TRIPS HE ADDED AS HIS CALLER LOOKED A BIT SURPRISED
HE IS A GENTLEMAN OH SAID CARROLL AND THONG IN UNISON
I WENT AWAY AFTER SHE THREW ME OVER HE RESUMED
BUT HOW DID HE KNOW THAT LARCH KILLED HER ASKED DARCY AS HE AND AMY RODE AWAY IN HER CAR AMID THE CHEERS OF THE THRONG OUTSIDE THE COUNTY BUILDING
SECOND WHO INFLICTED EITHER OR BOTH WOUNDS
THE DETECTIVE BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT HIS APARTMENT GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND FROM A SUITCASE WHICH WAS CLOSED WITH A COMPLICATED LOCK HE TOOK A NUMBER OF ARTICLES WHICH HE STOWED AWAY IN VARIOUS POCKETS OF HIS GARMENTS
I SHOULD SAY I DID
AMELIA
THE LATTER WITH A PITYING SMILE ON HIS FACE LEANED OVER TO PICK THEM UP
CHET WAS THE PET OF A MAN--A PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THE HOTEL--WHO HAD THE SUITE NEXT COLONEL ASHLEY'S AND EARLY IN HIS STAY AT THE HOSTELRY THE DETECTIVE HAD MADE FRIENDS WITH THE LITTLE ANIMAL WHICH WHEN MR BLAND ITS OWN MASTER WAS OUT OFTEN CAME IN TO VISIT THE FISHERMAN JUST AS HE HAD DONE NOW
YOU SEE HER HUSBAND OH HO THERE WAS A WORLD OF MEANING IN THAT EXCLAMATION
AND SO AFTER THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF WONDER AND SURMISE AND OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER DARCY OR KING MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME OR PERHAPS SOME DESPERATE BURGLAR THE DARCY CASE WAS CROWDED OFF THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPERS TO GIVE WAY TO ITEMS OF MORE OR LESS LOCAL INTEREST IN COLCHESTER
SOMETHING JUST AS UNEXPECTED AS THIS MAY TURN UP IN HIS CASE AND THE COLONEL MOTIONED TO THE WATCH
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A QUARTER TO ELEVEN AND YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ALL NIGHT CARROLL SHOT THIS QUESTION AT DARCY SUDDENLY
NOW REMEMBER THAT HE IS OF EXCITABLE NATURE THAT HE IS A FOREIGNER FEARFUL OF OUR LAWS AND THAT HE KNOWS THE DEADLY NATURE OF THE POISON IN THE WATCH
COLONEL ASHLEY FOLLOWED
COME ON AND HE LED THE WAY BACK TO THE CELL
I'LL HAVE TO NOSE AROUND A BIT THERE CAME A KNOCK ON THE OFFICE DOOR
MAYBE IT'S AGAINST MY INTERESTS TO SAY THAT BUT I'VE SORT OF TOOK A NOTION TO YOU
I WENT TO YOUR HOTEL
THEN DESCENDING TO THE STORE THE INTRUDER MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO LOOT THE SAFE WHEN HE WAS DISTURBED BY MRS DARCY WHO MAY HAVE COME DOWN TO SEE WHAT THE UNUSUAL NOISE WAS
I MUST GET AFTER SOME OF THEM
I CAN CHANGE WHENEVER I LIKE SPOTTY RAISED A GLASS TO HIS LIPS AND WITH A MURMURED HERE'S HOW LET THE CONTENTS SLIDE DOWN HIS ALWAYS-PARCHED THROAT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLICE OR DETECTIVES SHE WENT ON BUT I'M SURE THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OF PROVING THAT MY--THAT JIMMIE HAD NO HAND IN THIS
THEN I'LL KNOW JUST WHERE TO GO FISHING
I OVERHEARD LARCH SOUNDING HIM AS TO THE CHANCES OF RAISING A BIG SUM AND WHAT DID KING SAY HE AGREED TO TRY TO GET IT FOR LARCH
WHAT ESPECIALLY DID YOU WANT TO TELL ME WELL KING IS IN THERE IN HIS USUAL STATE--DIGNIFIED OF COURSE BUT HOW LONG HE'LL STAY THAT WAY I CAN'T TELL
THAT IS ALL I ASK OF YOU I'M AFRAID IT CAN'T BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS ALL THAT AND THE MAN LAUGHED CUTTINGLY
COLONEL ASHLEY DARCY EXCLAIMED
YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIMEPIECES WERE STOPPED--ALL OF THEM IN FACT EXCEPT THE WATCH IN YOUR COUSIN'S HAND YES I REMARKED THAT AT THE TIME
AS THE DETECTIVE WHO IS GOING TO HELP PROVE YOU INNOCENT BY DISCOVERING THE REAL--UGH
WHASH MATTER YOU FELLERS ANYHOW
THE BOY SPED AWAY OVER THE FIELDS
HE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE WITNESS ROOM OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL TO THE LESS PLEASANT JAIL AND PUT IN A CELL AS WERE THE OTHER UNFORTUNATES OF THAT INSTITUTION
THEY'RE NASTY TO HANDLE
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IT IS SERIOUS--FOR ME THEN I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU
IT BEARS NO EVIDENCE OF IT AND THE JEWELER FOCUSED HIS GLASS ON THE DISMEMBERED TIMEPIECE
TICK-TICK
TICK-TICK
FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS HER HEART BEATING NO I MEAN DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING IN THE NIGHT WENT ON THE DETECTIVE
THEY WOULD NOT LET ME SEE JIMMIE AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS BUT I SENT WORD THAT DAD AND I WERE GOING TO WORK FOR HIM EVERY MINUTE THAT MUST HAVE CHEERED HIM I HOPE IT DID
SO I DEMANDED THAT SHE KEEP HER PROMISE BUT SHE REFUSED PLEADING THAT MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS OWED HER AND TIMES WERE HARD
AMY HAD HAD BUT LITTLE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DARCY SINCE HIS ARREST
THE DEATH WATCH XI
THE CLERKS REPORT AT EIGHTY-THIRTY--THERE'S SOME OF EM NOW MORE KNOCKINGS HAD SOUNDED ON THE FRONT DOOR AND THE FACES OF TWO YOUNG MEN PEERED IN THROUGH THE MISTY GLASS THE CROWD HAVING MADE A LANE FOR THEM ON LEARNING THAT THEY WORKED IN THE PLACE OF DEATH
I GOT UP A LITTLE BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK TO DO SOME REPAIR WORK ON A MAN'S WATCH
IF I COULD FIND OUT WHY SINGA PHUT USED THIS WATCH I'D BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ANSWER AND FROM THE PACKAGE THE DETECTIVE TOOK THE TIMEPIECE WHICH HE HAD KEPT AFTER DONOVAN HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM TO EXAMINE
THE WATCH CAN'T DO THAT AS WELL AS POISON TO DEATH
DARCY INDICATED A LITTLE CLOSET NEAR HIS WORK BENCH
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME OBJECT
WHASH MATTER HERE
IT WOULD BE A RATHER GREWSOME OBJECT TO HAVE AROUND AFTER IT HAD KILLED THE OLD LADY MURMURED THE REPORTER
BUT NO MATTER
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BUT I DID
AND SO IT IS WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS MUSED THE COLONEL
THE COLONEL WAS A BIT-DAZED BUT NOT SO MUCH SO THAT HE COULD NOT HEAR SEVERAL MURMUR
OH MISS BRILL COME IN AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE ONE YOUNG WOMAN CLERK WHO DREW BACK IN HORRIFIED FRIGHT AS SHE SAW THE SILENT FIGURE ON THE FLOOR
VERY INTERESTING
SPOTTY MUST HAVE ROBBED THE JEWELRY STORE IN SPITE OF WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT IT MUSED THE COLONEL
ANOTHER WOUND EXCLAIMED DALEY HIS NEWSPAPER INSTINCTS QUICKLY AROUSED BY THIS ADDITION OF EVIDENCE OF MYSTERY
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW IT I DIDN'T
THEY ARE TO BE MARRIED IN ABOUT A YEAR
NOW HURRY AND YOU NEEDN'T COME BACK TO THE STATION RIGHT AWAY BUT HE TOLD ME TO BRING HIM AN ANSWER OH DID HE
A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW XVIII
WHAT IS IT WELL COLONEL SAH DE PAPER DONE GOT IN IT AN COUNT OB A STRANGE AN MYSTERIOUS MURDER CASE AN I KNEW IT
BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN
NO ANSWERED THE JEWELRY WORKER HOLLOWLY
IT WAS PERHAPS NOT JUST THE THING TO DO
THE GONGS OF THE FEW TROLLEY CARS THAT WERE SENT OUT TO TAKE THE EARLY TOILERS TO THEIR TASKS RANG AS THOUGH COVERED WITH A BLANKET OF FOG
SALLIE NO
BUT I HAVE GOTTEN SO IN THE HABIT OF ROUSING AT ALMOST ANY HOUR I MENTALLY SET FOR MYSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT I DON'T NEED AN ALARM CLOCK
ALL RIGHT COLONEL I WILL
BASSET WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN WELL COLONEL I DON'T KNOW WHOSE CROSS THIS IS BUT WHOEVER LOST IT DIDN'T LOSE MUCH
YOU MAY SEND IT CHARGE IT WAS TO THAT CLASS OF TRADE THAT MRS DARCY CATERED
TOM HERE PROPOSED COMING TO SEE YOU AND WHEN DAD HEARD WHO YOU WERE THOUGH WE KNEW NOTHING OF YOU HE SAID THE SAME THING
OH THAT YOU JACK
I'LL PUT THE BEST FACE ON IT I CAN FOR HER AND YOU YOURSELF COLONEL
HE SELLS PAPERS ON THE EXPRESS
I DON'T SAY HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER--ESPECIALLY NOT AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT SINGA PHUT
I'M SORRY BUT IT WOULDN'T DO--HERE AND THE DOCTOR MOTIONED TO THE GLITTERING ARRAY OF CUT GLASS AND PLATE
INTERNATIONAL FICTION LIBRARY CLEVELAND NEW YORK PRESS OF THE COMMERCIAL BOOKBINDING CO
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT SO I LET EM GO
THIS ORNAMENT LARCH INSTANTLY DEMANDED BUT MRS DARCY REFUSED TO GIVE IT UP NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDITION BUT BECAUSE SHE DID NOT CONSIDER THAT HE HAD ANY CLAIM TO IT KNOWING THAT IT HAD BEEN HIS WIFE'S BEFORE THEIR MARRIAGE
I DON'T SEE HE BEGAN
I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN IT
HER BODY SWAYED
IN NEW YORK WHICH WAS REACHED EARLY IN THE MORNING AFTER A NIGHT JOURNEY THE COLONEL AGAIN TOOK UP THE TRAIL KEEPING NEAR HIS MAN
WHAT D'YOU S'POSE THE WARDEN'S ALL LIT UP FOR CERTAINLY THE GLOOMY JAIL WAS MORE BRIGHTLY LIGHTED THAN USUAL AT NIGHT FOR THE PRISONERS WERE LOCKED IN THEIR CELLS AND ALL ILLUMINATION SAVE THE KEEPERS LIGHTS PUT OUT AT NINE O'CLOCK
TRUST A DISGRUNTLED LOVER FOR SAYING THE WORST ABOUT THE OTHER CHAP
AND NOW SHAG DON'T FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU HE SAID TO HIS ATTENDANT AS THE TRAIN DREW INTO COLCHESTER
COME ON IF YOU WANT TO CALL WHAT'S-HER-NAME IT TOOK SOME LITTLE TIME BY CALLING AND POUNDING OUTSIDE HER DOOR TO AROUSE DEAF SALLIE PAGE AND LONGER TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS WANTED
I WANTED TO COME TO YOUR HOTEL AT ONCE BUT THE STORM GOT TOO BAD SO I WAITED UNTIL THIS MORNING AND THEN WE MOTORED IN
EITHER WOULD HAVE CAUSED DEATH CAN YOU TELL WHICH KILLED HER I SHOULD SAY THE STAB WOUND BUT I CAN NOT BE POSITIVE
NOW JACK A WAITER WHO KNEW THE COLONEL FROM THE FACT THAT THE LATTER WAS A STRIKING FIGURE AND HAD BEEN IN THE HOMESTEAD MORE THAN ONCE APPROACHED THE PRIVATE ROOM OCCUPIED BY THE DETECTIVE AND JACK YOUNG AND ANNOUNCED
YOU MANAGED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM THAT WASN'T HARD
OTHERS HAD NOT BEEN LIGHTED AND TWO OR THREE WERE BROKEN IN HALF NEITHER END SHOWING SIGNS OF EITHER HAVING BEEN SCORCHED BY A MATCH OR WET BY THE LIPS OF SINGA PHUT
COLONEL ASHLEY READ
I GUESS I MUSTN'T LOSE SIGHT OF YOU AARON GRAFTON
WE CATCH EM ALIVE
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT ABRASION IN THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND A SORT OF SCRATCH OR PUNCTURE AS THOUGH FROM A PIN BUT AS SHE WAS IN THE JEWELRY BUSINESS AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT OFTEN MADE SLIGHT REPAIRS HERSELF TO BROOCHES AND PINS BROUGHT IN THIS COULD EASILY BE ACCOUNTED FOR A SLIGHT ABRASION IN THE LEFT HAND YOU SAY YES
UM MUSED THE COLONEL READING THE TIMES ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY THE CRIME WAS DISCOVERED
I WONDER IF IT WON'T BE BEST TO HAVE KETTRIDGE COME HERE AND PERFORM THE AUTOPSY ON THAT WATCH AND HE LOOKED TOWARD THE CLOSET WHERE HE HAD PLACED THE ONE THAT HAD BELONGED TO SINGA PHUT
IT WAS HIS LAST BREATH ALL RIGHT
IT WAS ALL I COULD DO
NOW WHEN HE COMES BUT AMY MY DEAR
THE COLONEL AFTER A PERIOD OF SILENT CHUCKLING MIRTH OPENED HIS BOOK AGAIN AND READ
I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE SAID THE COLONEL QUIETLY
LOOKS LIKE DEVIL T'PAY
I THINK I'LL ASK DONOVAN WHAT SINGA PHUT SAID WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH MURDERING HIS PARTNER SAID THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF
SHE WAS DISTRESSED OF COURSE BUT I SAID I WOULD TAKE IT TO A JEWELER'S AND HAVE IT REPAIRED WITHOUT ANY ONE BEING THE WISER
WHAT'S THE ROW DEMANDED PATROLMAN MULLIGAN
IF YOU HAVE ANY NEWS NO SAH COLONEL TISN'T BOUT PO OLE MISS DARCY--LEASTWAYS NOT MUCH ABOUT HER
I REMEMBER AT THE TIME IT FELT AS THOUGH SOMETHING HAD PASSED OVER MY FACE LIKE A HAND SUGGESTED CARROLL
SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY BUT NONE THE LESS SURELY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE HOMESTEAD
I REALIZE IT MORE AND MORE
HE WAS A POLITICIAN AND POLITICS AND THE POLICE WERE NO MORE DIVORCED IN COLCHESTER THAN ELSEWHERE
BUT EVEN SO IT WAS DONE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO
HE WAS WHINING AND PAWING AT HIS JAWS
HOWEVER AS YOU WON YOUR CASE I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T SO MUCH MATTER NOT A GREAT DEAL
HE KNOCKED HER DOWN AND THAT WAS THE END AS FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED
BUT THAT INSUFFERABLE YOUNG PUPPY HAD THE EXTREME AUDACITY TO INFLICT HIMSELF ON ME WHEN I WAS READING AND I LOST MY TEMPER
AND I CAN'T DO THAT YET
THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF NOISE AROUND HERE UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT--THEATERS AND MOVING PICTURE PLACES LET OUT ABOUT 11:30
BUT WHO DOES YO S'PECT DID DISH YEAH KILLIN IT'S TOO EARLY YET TO TELL SHAG AND YOU KNOW I DON'T MAKE ANY PREDICTIONS
SO HELP ME--NOT INTENTIONAL WELL MAYBE NOT BUT I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU
I BELIEVE HE'D TRY TO PUMP ME
CERTAINLY THE COLONEL HAD SPOKEN AS THOUGH HE MIGHT AT ONE TIME HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO GET THE RIGHT MAN DID THAT MEAN THE REAL MURDERER
THE WIRES AS I UNDERSTAND IT ARE TO RUN AN ELECTRIC LATHE AND THEY MIGHT EASILY HAVE BECOME CROSSED OH YES OF COURSE ADMITTED CARROLL
I GUESS WE CAN'T
HE SMOKED SOME OF EM ALL RIGHT OBSERVED THE DEPUTY
NO I DON'T RECALL WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT WATCH
SALLIE
A KEEPER WAS SUMMONED WITH A BROOM AND BRUSHED OUT THE CELL
I MEAN IN THIS WAY WENT ON THE COLONEL
IT'S MORTGAGED UP TO THE ROOF AND HE CAN'T MEET HIS PAYMENTS
THERE HAD BEEN OTHER LOVERS WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE WEDDED IT WAS RUMORED AND MORE THAN ONE HAD REMARKED
MORE WAGGING OF THE TAIL TO INDICATE PLEASURE SATISFACTION AND WHATEVER ELSE DOGS THUS EXPRESS
I WAS ONLY AWAKE MAYBE TWO OR THREE MINUTES YOU DIDN'T CALL MRS DARCY NO NOR THE SERVANT--WHAT'S HER NAME
HIS CHIEF ANXIETY IS REGARDING YOU
AND CAN IT BE DONE IT CAN AND I'M GOING TO DO IT
WELL SEE THAT YOU MIND SELECTING WITH CARE A FLY FROM HIS NUMEROUS COLLECTION AND HOPING THE APPETITES OF THE FISH WOULD INCLINE THEM TO CONSIDER IT FAVORABLY THAT MORNING COLONEL ASHLEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIS CASTS STANDING NOT FAR FROM A BENT GNARLED AND TWISTED ELM TREE THAT OVERHUNG THE BANK OF THE STREAM WHERE THE CURRENT HAD CUT INTO THE SOIL MAKING A DEEP EDDY IN WHICH A LAZY TROUT MIGHT CHOOSE TO LIE IN WAIT FOR SOME CHOICE MORSEL
A NUMBER OF ENTERTAINMENTS WERE GIVEN REMARKABLE FOR THE BRILLIANT AND EFFECTIVE DRESSES OF THE WOMEN THE MULTIPLICITY AND RICHNESS OF THE FOOD AND THE VARIETY OF THE WINES
TRADE WAS ABOUT THE SAME UNDER THE SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF MR KETTRIDGE AND THE CUT GLASS AND SILVER GLEAMED AND GLISTENED IN THE SHOWCASES AS THOUGH THE FORMER OWNER OF IT ALL HAD NOT BEEN CRUELLY SLAIN
QUITE A PLACE MURMURED THE COLONEL AS HE PASSED ON TOWARD THE SPORTING GOODS STORE
THIS SHE CONSENTED TO DO
LOOKS LIKE THEY'D BEEN ROBBING A GEM STORE YOU DON'T KNOW OF ANY DIAMONDS MISSING FROM MRS DARCY'S STOCK DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL OF MR KETTRIDGE
I'LL LOOK AT IT HERE
BUT SINCE YOU WILL TESTIFY ABOUT THESE WOUNDS AND SINCE YOU HAVE ALREADY PRETTY WELL DESCRIBED THEM TO THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS IT CAN DO NO HARM TO REPEAT THE DETAILS TO ME NONE IN THE LEAST COLONEL THEN YOU FEEL SURE THE STAB WOUND KILLED HER REASONABLY SO
THERE WAS A PERIOD OF WAITING
HE WAS EXAMINING THE SIDE DOOR LEADING TO THE ALLEY
I WONDER HE MUSED I WONDER IF I DID RIGHT HIS HAND SOUGHT HIS POCKET AND CAME OUT EMPTY
KING WAS NOT SO VERY DRUNK THEN HE SAID
THEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND FOUND MRS DARCY LYING HERE--DEAD I WASN'T SURE SHE WAS DEAD OH SHE WAS DEAD ALL RIGHT BROKE IN THONG
AND REALLY I HARDLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
AND IS THERE ANY TRUTH IN THE NEWSPAPER STORY ABOUT THE SAME WATCH THAT WAS FOUND IN MRS DARCY'S HAND BEING FOUND IN THE HAND OF THE DEAD MAN YES THAT PART'S TRUE ENOUGH BUT THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
IT'S--IT'S AN ODD COIN--AN OLD ROMAN ONE--THAT MRS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM A BLACK-JACK AND HE GLANCED QUESTIONINGLY AT THE DETECTIVES
I KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU THINK
YES THIS IS FAR ENOUGH I SUPPOSE SAID THE MAN AND THERE WAS A SNEER IN HIS TONES
OUTSIDE THE RAIN WAS FALLING
SHE HAS PICKED UP THE WATCH--SHE MUST HAVE DONE THAT FOR IT WAS IN HER HAND
YES BUT THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE PASSING THE STORE AROUND MIDNIGHT
I'M GOING TO GET RIGHT OUT AND THE RECEIVER WENT ON THE HOOK WITH A BANG
WELL WHEN CYNTHIA CAME TO ME IN MY CAPACITY AS LAWYER AS WELL AS OLD FRIEND I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER HUSBAND WENT ON KENNETH
AFTER TEN MINUTES OF SKILFUL WORK DURING WHICH TIME THE TROUT NEARLY GOT AWAY BY SHOOTING UNDER A SUBMERGED LOG LIKE AN UNDERSEA BOAT DIVING BENEATH A BATTLE CRUISER THE COLONEL LANDED HIS FISH DROPPING IT PANTING ON THE GREEN GRASS
YOU AREN'T USUALLY IN SUCH HASTE TO LEAVE ME EVEN IF YOU HAVE LAID OUT ALL MY DUDS
THERE--SEE HER HE POINTED A TREMBLING FINGER
HIS MANNER SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS ON THE TRACK OF SOMETHING
EASY THERE
SEE YOU LATER AND MAKING SURE THAT HIS BLACKJACK AND REVOLVER WERE IN HIS POCKETS DONOVAN HURRIED OUT FOLLOWED BY THE COLONEL WHOSE HAND HAD LOOSELY CLOSED OVER THE TICKING WATCH WHICH UNSEEN WENT OUT WITH HIM
DONOVAN HELLO ANSWERED THE SLEUTH
HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY FURTHER INTO THE MYSTERY NOT AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE TO GET
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MASSIVE SAFE SEEMED TO LEAR AT HIM WITH A BLEARED EYE LIKE THAT OF A TOPER WHO HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN CONVIVIAL COMPANY FOUND HIMSELF MOST UNACCOUNTABLY ON HIS OWN DOORSTEP IN THE GRAY DAWN
I'VE GOT TO SEND HIM WORD HE REASONED
BUT WE HAVE SETTLED SOMETHING REGARDING THE WATCH ANYHOW
WELL I'VE COME TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED YOUR SERVICES ANY MORE NOT NEED THEM NO
I WONDER WHEN I'LL BEGIN TO UNRAVEL SOME OF THEM FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN THE COLONEL SAID NOTHING TO THE POLICE OR COUNTY AUTHORITIES IN COLCHESTER ABOUT THE ARREST OF SPOTTY NOR DID HE MENTION THAT NOR THE FINDING OF THE DIAMOND CROSS TO DARCY OR GRAFTON
I HAVEN'T DONE A TAP OF WORK ON THE CASE AND I'M NOT GOING TO
THERE WERE GASPS OF ALARM AND SIGHS OF RELIEF
WHERESH MY LI'L PRESHENT FOR WIFELY
A BRASS CONNECTION HAD BEEN BENT
DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS FACE AS THOUGH TO BRUSH AWAY UNSEEN COBWEBS
IF HE GOES IN THE DIRECTION I THINK HE WILL I'LL GET IT TOO
THE VERY BEST
THAT IS UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO SET NIGHT LINES I MAY HAVE TO DO THAT THE DETECTIVE AGREED
SAID HE KNEW YOU WANTED HIM FOR THE JOB AND WAS SORRY HE MADE SO MUCH TROUBLE
YOU'VE GOT TO SIGN
ISN'T THIS THE DIAMOND CROSS THAT MRS LARCH OWNED
AND THE COLONEL STEPPED SQUARELY ON THIS PEELING AS HE TRIED TO RETREAT
FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE LOOK AT THIS HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
FIRST EDITIONS DON'T WAIT FOR GUM-SHOE MEN EVEN IF THEY'RE OF THE FIRST WATER
THE STEP WAS THAT OF THE KEEPER OF THE OUTER GATE--THE LARGER AND MORE MASSIVELY BARRED GATE WHICH GAVE ENTRANCE TO THE ANTEROOM WHERE ON VISITING DAYS EVEN THOSE CHARGED WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CRIME WERE PERMITTED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS RELATIVES OR COUNSEL
THE WATCH OF DEATH MUSED THE COLONEL
TOM SUGGESTED THAT I COME TO SEE YOU AND ASK YOU TO TAKE MR DARCY'S CASE--TO PROVE THAT HE HAD NO HAND IN THE MURDER--FOR I'M SURE HE DID NOT
THAT I COULDN'T SAY WHAT SORT OF A MAN IS THIS INDIAN--SINGA--SINGA BEGAN THONG HESITATINGLY
HE WAS MOST EMPHATIC HOWEVER IN DENYING THAT HE HAD TAKEN IT FROM MRS DARCY OR THAT HE HAD EVEN SEEN HER OR BEEN TO HER STORE
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE THAT WAY
SHE DIDN'T FAVOR MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE ELECTRICAL LATHE AND I HAD TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT IT
ONE MATTER PUZZLED THE COLONEL AS WELL AS THE OTHER DETECTIVES
YOU KNOW I'M WORKING TO SAVE DARCY SO I'VE HEARD WELL YOU EXAMINED MRS DARCY SOON AFTER SHE WAS FOUND DEAD
AND IN THE DEAD MAN'S HAND WAS A TICKING WATCH READ THE COLONEL
I LET YOU RAISE MONEY ON THEM ONCE AND ALMOST LOST THEM
MRS LARCH RESUMING HER MAIDEN NAME IT WAS ANNOUNCED HAD GONE TO A QUIET PLACE TO REST
SOME ONE OF SINGA PHUT'S INDIAN FRIENDS KNOWING HE WOULD RATHER GO OUT THIS WAY THAN PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME BROUGHT IN A PACKAGE OF HIS FAVORITE CIGARETTES
I THOUGHT I KNEW SOMETHING OF THE JEWELRY BUSINESS BUT THIS PUZZLES ME JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO SIMPLE LAUGHED THE DETECTIVE
HE SEEMED TO BE CONTROLLING HIMSELF BY AN EFFORT AND SHE SEEMED TO SHRINK AWAY
YOU BUY CRIED DONOVAN
BUT I HEAR YOU HAVE ANOTHER MURDER YES BUT IT'S SO PLAIN THERE'S NO INTEREST IN IT FOR YOU
IF YOU'RE NOT BUSY SIR I'D LIKE JUST A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR TIME--OFFICIALLY OF COURSE ALWAYS READY FOR DUTY COLONEL
I DO YET BUT IN A WAY THAT IS PERFECTLY RIGHT
MANY'S THE TRINKET I'VE BOUGHT OF HER FOR--FOR--WELL SOME OF THE GIRLS YOU KNOW AND HE WINKED SUGGESTIVELY AT THE DETECTIVES
BUT IT'S SO QUIET--THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE TICKING OF THE WATCH SOUND SO PLAIN IT IS QUIET OBSERVED TREMLAIN
I KNOW EM
I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO-DAY
HASTILY HE TORE THE NOTE OPEN
IF IT HAD BEEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IT'S DE TRAIN NEWSBOY WHUT YO GIVE A DOLLAR TO LAS NIGHT COLONEL THE ONE WHO WANTED TO SELL ME A DETECTIVE STORY I'M HIM COLONEL BRENTNALL ANSWERED THE LAD A SMILE OF TRIUMPH LIGHTING UP HIS FACE
I'D SPEND THE LAST DOLLAR OF THAT
I WILL THE SILENCE OF THE COLONEL'S ROOM WAS BROKEN BY A PECULIAR SCRATCHING AT THE DOOR INTERRUPTING HIS PERUSAL OF THIS PASSAGE
I AM NOW GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT THEN MAYBE AMY WILL DO THE SAME IT WAS NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE THE COLONEL KNEW THIS POINT
WE'LL GET HIM TOO BEFORE MANY DAYS
SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED--THERE WERE SO MANY IN THE PLACE
IT ROLLED OUT ON THE FLOOR AND THE COLONEL STOOPED TO PICK IT UP
BUT IT'S ONLY A WATCH MAYBE SO ASSENTED CASEY
YOU'RE RIGHT HE ADMITTED
AMY'S TEST XIX
THEN HE WENT ON HALF MURMURING TO HIMSELF
YOU SEE I WAS ALL EXCITED LIKE YES ASSENTED THONG
WELL THAT'S ALL I CAN DO NOW DR WARREN SAID AFTER HIS VERY PERFUNCTORY EXAMINATION
I'M GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH DARCY IN THE MORNING AND IF I FIND HE'S BEEN DECEIVING ME WELL I'LL DROP HIS CASE THAT'S ALL IF DARCY SIMULATED SURPRISE WHEN THE NEXT MORNING AT THE JAIL TOLD BY THE COLONEL OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO SALLIE PAGE THE PRISONER WAS A CONSUMMATE ACTOR THE DETECTIVE THOUGHT
I WONDER IF SHE'LL KEEP HER WORD HE MURMURED
I'LL TELL YOU AS SOON AS I'VE SEEN MISS RATCHFORD
WHEREVER HE GOES
THREE ANYHOW--MAYBE FOUR
CASEY WAS ABOUT TO TELEPHONE WHEN TREMLAIN WHO HAD GONE OUT INTO THE ALLEY FROM THE SIDE DOOR HURRIED BACK TO REPORT
HE SAW TOO THE STAINED AND KEEN PAPER KNIFE WHICH THE DRUNKEN KING HAD SWAGGERED IN TO CLAIM THAT GRAY MORNING
BETTER PHONE THE MORGUE KEEPER HE WENT ON AND HAVE THEM COME FOR THE BODY HAVE YOU--HAVE YOU GOT TO TAKE HER AWAY FALTERED DARCY
BUT YOU'LL NEVER GET ME TO THE CHAIR
HE DIDN'T LOOK STRONG
JAY KENNETH DARCY'S LAWYER A YOUNG MEMBER OF THE BAR BUT ENTHUSIASTIC AND A HARD WORKER HAD MADE A FORMAL ENTRY OF A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY FOR HIS CLIENT WHEN THE LATTER HAD BEEN ARRAIGNED BEFORE THE UPPER COURT AND HAD ASKED FOR A SPEEDY TRIAL
LIGHTLY AS A FEATHER THE COLONEL FLICKED A FLY OVER THE QUIET POOL WHERE THE WATERS SWIRLED IN A LAZY EDDY
AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOME TALL THINKING NOW
AS FOR KING--IF HE WAS DRUNK ENOUGH AND WANTED MONEY--OR THOUGHT HE COULD GET SOME DIAMONDS--IT MIGHT BE--IT MIGHT BE
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR BEGAN MR BARDON I HAD HOPED TO MOVE THE CASE OF THE STATE AGAINST JAMES DARCY INDICTED FOR MURDER BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE I FIND THAT ONE OF MY IMPORTANT WITNESSES IS UNABLE TO BE IN ATTENDANCE AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I AM COMPELLED TO ASK FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF TWO WEEKS
OH THERE WAS A WORLD OF MEANING IN DARCY'S INTERJECTION
IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE DO YOU THINK THIS WILL HELP IN SOLVING THE MYSTERY IT MAY BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE POISON-NEEDLE WATCH MIGHT NOT HAVE KILLED MRS DARCY I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING JACK
NOW WHAT MUSED THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF IS HE FISHING FOR THAT DAY THERE WAS MORE THAN THE USUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE STORE--MANY OF THEM UNDOUBTEDLY CURIOSITY SEEKERS WHO CAME INTO PRICE CERTAIN ARTICLES OSTENSIBLY BUT WHO REALLY WANTED TO STARE AT THE PLACE WHERE THE BLOODSTAINS HAD BEEN SCRUBBED AWAY
HARK CAUTIONED TREMLAIN
HE TOLD ME I COULD HAVE ALL THE MONEY I WANTED AND I HAVE SOME OF MY OWN IF HIS ISN'T ENOUGH IT ISN'T ALWAYS A QUESTION OF MONEY BEGAN THE COLONEL GENTLY
THE DETECTIVE WAS A FISHERMAN IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
THE AUTOPSY HAD BEEN PERFORMED AND DR WARREN HAD SAID EITHER WOUND MIGHT HAVE CAUSED DEATH
OH JUST SOME CIGARETTES
HE WENT AT SPOTTY
IT WAS SPOTTY OR ONE OF HIS KIND WHO GOT IN AND OUT WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE
I REALLY CAN NOT CONSIDER ANYTHING AT THIS TIME
NO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING SAID DARCY IN A LOW VOICE
SOME EVEN VENTURED TO PRESS INTO THE STORE ITSELF--THE STORE WHERE THE SILENT FIGURE LAY HUDDLED BETWEEN THE SHOWCASES
WHICH REMINDS ME THAT I HAVE MORE IRONS IN THE FIRE THAN I SUSPECTED
THE TWO MEN HAD SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE BUT HAD NOT SPOKEN
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT WATCH--AND ALL THAT IT MEANS ASKED JACK YOUNG LATER WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO DEPART TO TAKE UP THE SHADOWING OF HARRY KING
COME ON AND HIS TONES WERE ROUGH
IT'S POSITIVELY INDECENT YES SAH COLONEL
AND AT THE END OF TWO DAYS THE DETECTIVE LEARNED THAT THE MERCHANT WAS GOING TO MAKE A HURRIED TRIP TO NEW YORK--A TRIP NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH HIS STORE FOR THOSE TRIPS WERE MADE AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT YOUNG SURE
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DID IT WELL THEN I'LL HAVE TO FISH ON THAT ALONE I GUESS
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME SPOTTY HAD HIRED OUT HIS SERVICES TO A MAN WHO WANTED SOMETHING DESPERATE DONE
WE'VE GOTTEN OVER THAT
I'LL BEAT EM YET
BUT THEY MAY--LATER
LOOKS LIKE A PARTY
YES SAH COLONEL OUT OF THE ROOM THIS INSTANT AND DON'T YOU DARE COME BACK UNTIL I SEND FOR YOU YES SAH COLONEL THE OLD COLORED MAN TURNED SLOWLY TO THE DOOR
IT'S ONE OB DE PAPERS GOTTEN OUT RIGHT YEAH IN DIS CITY AN WELL OUT WITH IT SHAG
TAKE THAT YOU SNEAKING FOOL THERE WAS A SLIVER OF FLAME IN THE DARKNESS AND MINGLED WITH THE REPORT CAME A CRY OF ANGUISH AND A WOMAN'S SCREAM AS A HEAVY STICK IN THE HANDS OF COLONEL ASHLEY BROKE THE HAND THAT HELD THE REVOLVER
MY GOD
I'M GIVING YOU THIS CHANCE
I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO DISAPPOINT YOU ABOUT THIS CROSS BUT OH THAT WAS MY OWN FAULT FOR TAKING TOO MUCH FOR GRANTED
JAMES DARCY SHIVERING AS HE AROSE SILENTLY PROTESTING FROM HIS WARM BED PULLED ON HIS GARMENTS AUDIBLY GRUMBLING THE GRUMBLE BECOMING A VOICED PROTEST AS HE SHUFFLED IN HIS SLIPPERS ALONG THE CORRIDOR ABOVE THE JEWELRY SHOP AND WENT DOWN THE PRIVATE STAIRS INTO THE MAIN SALES-ROOM
BETTER COME DOWN AND MEET HIM MR DARCY
WELL OLD FRIEND I GUESS I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH USE FOR YOU FROM NOW ON HE REMARKED DOLEFULLY
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU
CARROLL AND THONG WERE THERE AND IF THEY DID NOT EXACTLY WELCOME THE COLONEL AS A KINDRED SPIRIT THEY AT LEAST ACCORDED HIM THE RESPECT DUE A FELLOW CRAFTSMAN IN THE PECULIAR LINE WHERE TALENT MAY BE FOUND MOST UNEXPECTEDLY
THE BENCH WAS FITTED WITH A LATHE AND ON IT WERE PARTS OF WATCHES LIKE THE DEAD SPECIMENS PRESERVED IN ALCOHOL IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE
YOU SHALL SEE OR HEAR HIM LEAP AT FLIES THEN IF YOU GET A GRASSHOPPER PUT IT ON YOUR HOOK WITH YOUR LINE ABOUT TWO YARDS LONG STANDING BEHIND A BUSH OR TREE WHERE HIS HOLE IS ONCE MORE THE COLONEL WAS HAPPY
THE TELEPHONE RANG SHARPLY
IT SWIRLED ABOUT THE GLEAMING SHOWCASES REFLECTED FROM THE CUT GLASS DANCED AWAY FROM THE SILVER CUPS BROKE INTO POINTS OF LIGHT FROM THE TIMES OF FORKS BECAME BROAD SPLOTCHES ON THE BLADES OF KNIVES AND PERCHANCE MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE CRACKS INTO THE SAFE WHERE IT BATHED THE DIAMONDS THE RUBIES THE SAPPHIRES THE AQUA MARINES THE PEARLS THE JADES AND THE BLOODSTONES IN A WHITE MIST
KILLED EH MURMURED CARROLL AS HE BENT OVER THE BODY
IT WAS A FOOLISH MARRIAGE THOUGH AT THE TIME IT MAY HAVE SEEMED ADVANTAGEOUS TO HER--OR HER MOTHER
BUT FOR EVERY BLOW YOU STRIKE--FOR EVERY HOUR YOU KEEP ME AWAKE WHEN I'M DEAD FOR SLEEP--YOU'LL BE SORRY COLONEL
WELL I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE I GIVE YOU MY WORD
DO YOU THINK MR GRAFTON THE DETECTIVE SMILED AND SHOOK HIS FINGER AT DARCY
PLEASE DON'T--NOT YET HE SAID
I'M GOING TO SEE HOW IT'S MADE AND TRY TO LEARN WHETHER OR NOT DARCY WAS AWARE OF ITS DEADLY NATURE
SOME OF THE WATCHES OF HER DAY WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF CROSSES PURSES LITTLE BOOKS AND EVEN SKULLS PITY THIS ONE WASN'T MADE THAT WAY--LIKE A SKULL MUSED CARROLL SEEING IT'S BEEN IN ON TWO DEATHS HERE AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
A BIT FOOLISH OF HIM UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
NOW FOR THE NEXT MOVE MURMURED THE COLONEL
HE CAN'T BE OUT
SCUSE ME COLONEL SAH HE BEGAN BUT DOES YO WANT T HEAH ANY NEWS ANY NEWS SHAG
THOUGHT WAS NOT QUICKER THAN THE LEAPING FORWARD OF COLONEL ASHLEY
NOW TO FISH AND FORGET EVERYTHING IT WAS A FAIR MORNING IN APRIL WITH THE SUN JUST RIGHT WITH THE WIND IN THE WEST WHEN THE FISH BITE BEST AND COLONEL ROBERT LEE ASHLEY WITH THE FAITHFUL SHAG TO CARRY HIS RODS CREEL AND A LUNCH BASKET SALLIED FORTH FROM HIS HOTEL FOR A DAY BESIDE A NO-VERY-DISTANT STREAM THE VIRTUES OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD WERE MOST ALLURING AS REGARDED TROUT
IT'S IN THAT JEWELRY STORE AND HE POINTED BACK TOWARD IT FOR HE HAD RUN DOWN THE STREET A LITTLE WAY
BY THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION SO HE TOLD DAD
THEY KNEW THEY COULD HAVE IT OR NOT HAVE IT AS THEY PLEASED
SHE SAW THE WATCH ON THE TABLE AND PICKING IT UP MAY HAVE WOUND IT
NOW LOOK HERE KING
WELL I'LL FOOL YOU ALL
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING QUEER THERE
THEY HAD SEEN THE TWO MILK WAGONS IN FRONT OF THE JEWELRY STORE--THE STORE WHICH THOUGH MOST OF THE MORE VALUABLE PIECES WERE IN THE SAFE--STILL SHOWED IN THE GLEAMING WINDOWS MUCH THAT CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE PASSERBY
I JEST WANTS PEACE AN QUIET AN FISH HE DONE COME UP HEAH T GO FISHIN LAIK HE GO T LOTS OTHER PLACES THOUGH HE AIN'T BEEN HEAH FO GOOD MANY YEARS
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR ME
WE'LL HAVE OUR LITTLE SURPRISE TOO GOOD
YOU KNOW THE TROUBLE I'M IN
OF COURSE I REALIZE I MIGHT JUST HAVE BEEN BADLY HURT AND PERHAPS HAVE LINGERED ON IN A HOSPITAL FOR SOME YEARS--BUT THAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN DEATH
IT SAID
I'LL HAVE TO DO ANY SHADOWING AMONG THE SHADOWS I GUESS AS I'VE OFTEN CAST FOR TROUT
ARREST ME FOR MURDERING THE OLD WOMAN WILL YOU
WELL THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT SAID BASSET
THAT WAS LOCKED WITH THE SPRING CATCH FROM THE INSIDE WASN'T IT BOLTED CAME SHARPLY FROM THONG
I GIVE YOU ONLY ONE CHANCE JUST AS YOU GAVE ME--JUST AS YOU TOOK ONE AND SAVED ME
I COULDN'T SAY
BUT DON'T WORRY
THE STONES GLITTERED IN THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS FOR IT WAS THERE IN THE DISTANT CITY THAT THIS TALK TOOK PLACE
SHE WAS BADLY CUT BUT THE HOSPITAL DOCTOR SAID THERE WAS NO FRACTURE DID SHE GET SHOCKED FROM THE WIRES THAT RUN INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE CASE ASKED THE DETECTIVE
BUT IT SOUNDS SO DREADFUL
IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE NEARLY PASSED OVER BUT--NOT IN THAT WAY AND HE REACHED FOR HIS GLASS TO CONCEAL THE SHUDDER THAT PASSED OVER HIM AS HE THOUGHT OF THE RUMBLING WHEELS OF THE THUNDERING TRUCK
I MEAN MR KENNETH IF WE CALL UPON THE PROSECUTION TO MAKE OUT THEIR BEST CASE WHICH THEY CAN DO ONLY BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND THEN PUT OUR MAN ON THE STAND TO DENY EVERYTHING TO HAVE HIM TELL ABOUT THE NOISE IN THE NIGHT ABOUT THE CURIOUS SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CHLOROFORM CALL WITNESSES AS TO HIS GOOD CHARACTER--AND SO ON--WHAT ARE THE CHANCES RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY-FIFTY PROPOSITION
THERE WASN'T NOTHING THAT SINGA HAD TO DO WITH THE DARCY CASE ANYHOW AND HE SEEMED AWFUL ANXIOUS TO GET BACK THAT WATCH
SINGA PHUT DIDN'T LIKE THE KIND WE KEEP AND HE HAD TO HAVE HIS OWN FANCY KIND
I'VE GOT TO GET A CERTAIN MAN BACK HERE FROM THE WEST BUT I CAN SEND FOR HIM
BUT MRS DARCY WAS AS GOOD AS A CLERK HERSELF AND DURING THE HOLIDAY RUSH SHE WAS IN THE STORE NIGHT AND DAY
IT WILL BE A TERRIBLE BLOW TO AMY
AND I DON'T IN THE LEAST MIND ANY SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU COLONEL
MISS BRILL WAS SHOCKED AND FELL AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE DEAD BODY OF MRS DARCY WAS FOUND SAID MR KETTRIDGE IN A LOW INTENSE VOICE
BUT I BEG YOUR PARDON
THIS TRIP WEST WILL HAVE TO WAIT
I'M WORKING SEVERAL ENDS AND THEY ALL MUST BE FITTED TOGETHER LIKE THE OLD JIGSAW PUZZLE BEFORE I CAN ACT
IN FACT IT WAS SO TIGHT THAT HE'S CUT HIS PALM GRABBIN HOLD OF IT
BUT THE MURDER CHANGED ALL MY PLANS
THE BEST OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS OR PROSECUTOR'S DETECTIVES MAKE MISTAKES
IT MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HER SAFE FOR SHE HAD REFUSED MANY OFFERS TO SELL IT
I SAY CALLED THE COLONEL
BY GAD
BY GAD
I THINK THIS WILL BEAR LOOKING INTO CHAPTER XIII SINGA PHUT MR KETTRIDGE HIS EYES BIG WITH UNCONCEALED WONDER AS HE LOOKED AT THE ODD COIN WAS EAGER TO ACCOST HARRY KING AT ONCE AND DEMAND TO KNOW WHENCE THE ROYSTERER HAD OBTAINED IT
YES MURMURED CARROLL
I'LL GAMBLE IT WASN'T ONE OF THEM SAID CARROLL
THERE HE IS WENT THE WORDS OF THE BOY AS HE AND THE YOUNG WOMAN CAME IN SIGHT OF THE COLONEL AND SHAG--BUT IT WAS AT THE DETECTIVE THE LAD POINTED
GAD SIR THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING
OH I SUPPOSE I CAN'T BACK OUT NOW HE SIGHED
OH WELL HE'D HAVE BEEN CLEARED ANYHOW IF THE WORST HAD COME TO THE WORST SAID THE COLONEL
THERE WASN'T MUCH--THEY PICKED THE WRONG SAFE I GUESS BUT ANYHOW THEY TOOK THIS CROSS
I'D GIVE MY VERY LIFE TO MAKE HER HAPPY AND DO YOU THINK I'D I DON'T DOUBT YOU FOR A MOMENT SIR THANK YOU SAID MR GRAFTON
WELL COLONEL I DIDN'T TELL AND HE HAD NOT
THEY'VE ALL STOPPED YOU'RE RIGHT EXCLAIMED CASEY
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED GRAFTON MORE QUESTIONS AND GOTTEN A DESCRIPTION OF MRS LARCH'S ORNAMENT
DARCY ADMITTED RESENTING HIS COUSIN'S IMPUTATION
BUT NOW OH I NEVER WANT TO SEE IT IN THE HOUSE
AND NOW HE RAISED HIS GLASS--"TO ALL THE GODS THAT ON OLYMPUS DWELL AND THEY DRANK WITH HIM
IN THE LEFT HAND
HAVE YOU BEEN BUYING A NEWSPAPER YE--YE--YES SAH COLONEL I HAS
THE FIRST WATCHES YOU KNOW DONOVAN WERE REALLY SMALL CLOCKS AND SOME WERE SO MUCH LIKE CLOCKS THAT THE FOLKS WHO CARRIED THEM HAD TO HANG THEM TO THEIR BELTS INSTEAD OF CARRYING THEM IN THEIR POCKETS
COLONEL ASHLEY PUT IN DARCY THERE'S JUST ONE THING I CAN'T SEEM TO CLEAR UP IN ALL THIS BUSINESS WHAT'S THAT WELL WHAT MADE ALL THE CLOCKS STOP AT DIFFERENT TIMES
BUT IN COLCHESTER WHICH WAS RATHER UNIQUE AMONG CITIES HE WAS LOOKED UP TO AS ONE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL CITIZENS OF THE PLACE FOR HE OWNED THE HOMESTEAD WHERE WASHINGTON WHEN IT WAS A WAYSIDE INN HAD STOPPED ONE NIGHT--AT LEAST SUCH WAS THE RUMOR--AND FAMILIES SOCIALLY PROMINENT SOME OF WHOSE MEMBERS HAD VERY STRONG VIEWS ON PROHIBITION DID NOT HESITATE TO ATTEND BALLS GIVEN AT THE HOTEL
IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB ALL RIGHT HELD
WELL POOR CYNTHIA IS PAYING THE PENALTY NOW
HARRY KING NOW PAINFULLY SOBER WAS LIKEWISE HELD IN JAIL BAIL BEING FIXED BECAUSE OF HIS UNCERTAIN CHARACTER AT SUCH A HIGH FIGURE THAT HE COULD NOT SECURE IT
SEVERAL DAYS WENT BY
NO WONDER I DIDN'T THINK OF IT
PERHAPS I DID
THEN I TRIED TO AROUSE MYSELF BUT I HEARD THE WIND BLOWING AND A SPRINKLE OF RAIN AND AS MY WINDOW WAS OPEN I THOUGHT THE CURTAIN MIGHT HAVE BLOWN ACROSS MY FACE
UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL PACED JAMES DARCY
SURELY ENOUGH THERE HAD BEEN A MURDER
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE ON WITH THIS EVEN AFTER I STARTED EXCEPT FOR THE PLEADING OF MISS MASON
YOU CAN'T GET HIM
MAYBE IT WON'T BE FOR LONG WELL THERE'S NO USE BUOYING YOU UP WITH FALSE HOPES DARCY
HERE I'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA ABOUT HOW THEY RUN AND THE COLONEL DREW A SORT OF DIAGRAM OF THE JEWELRY STORE INDICATING THE SHOWCASE WHERE THE HIDDEN WIRES HAD BEEN FOUND EXPLAINING TO HIS MAN THE EFFECT ON THE YOUNG WOMAN CLERK WHO HAD BEEN SHOCKED
IT WOULD MAKE A DEADLY ONE USING THE FOOT END FOR A HANDLE AND DR WARREN WAVED THE ORNAMENT IN THE AIR OVER THE DEAD WOMAN'S HEAD TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT HE MEANT
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ME
YOUR MAN TOLD ME WHO YOU WAS AND I HEARD YOU TELL THE TAXI MAN WHERE TO DRIVE YOU
I NEVER KNEW THAT MY LATHE WIRES CROSSED OR CONNECTED WITH ANY CIRCUIT THAT MIGHT SHOCK A PERSON
I'VE RESIGNED FROM DETECTIVE WORK
DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE NAMES IT WOULD BE BETTER SINCE I ALREADY KNOW YOURS
OH WELL I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT I'VE GOT TO KEEP ON NOW THAT I'VE STARTED
WHAT IS IT ASKED COLONEL ASHLEY NOTING THE UNUSUAL LOOK
VERY WELL HE RESPONDED
IT WAS WHILE GETTING INTO THE MACHINE THAT A MESSAGE WAS HANDED THE COLONEL
NOW PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
WE HAD BETTER PREPARE OUR DEFENSE
WELL I CAN'T SAY I BLAME YOU FOR REALLY I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GIVE IT AS MUCH CONSIDERATION AS I'D LIKE
BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH
LET EM IN DARCY DID SO MULLIGAN HELPING HIM KEEP BACK THE CROWD OF CURIOUS ONES
THEN THEY HEARD A NOISE AND SKIPPED
AND YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME
I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN YOUR ABILITY JACK
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO LET DAD BEAT ME
IT WASN'T MUCH--JUST THE LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS THAT A WOMAN CAN DO BETTER THAN A MAN WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THINGS LOOK FANCY
I FOUND HER JUST AS SHE IS NOW AND CALLED IN THE MILKMEN WHO HAPPENED TO BE PASSING
I'LL TALK WITH HIM QUICKLY CROSSING THE ROOM THE DETECTIVE SPOKE RAPIDLY INTO THE INSTRUMENT
BAH THE WORDS WERE AS THOUGH HE SPEWED THEM FROM HIS MOUTH LIKE A BITTER TASTE
AFTER ALL DETECTIVE WORK IS THE OUTCOME OF COMMON SENSE PLUS A SORT OF SPECIAL INTUITION AND KNOWLEDGE
WE WANT TO GET AT THE FACTS
THAT SOUND WAS THE TICKING OF THE WATCH IN THE HAND OF THE DEAD WOMAN
SHAG WILL BE OVER PRESENTLY
GOT TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN A CASE LIKE THIS HE HALF APOLOGIZED
I NEVER WAS MUCH ON PENCIL WORK
GIMME OYSTER FORK--OR CLAM FOR THAT MATTER--AN A BREAD N BUTTER KNIFE--'N I'M ALL RIGHT
TROT ALONG NOW AND REMEMBER--DON'T SAY ANYTHING
IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER--THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL
NOT AFTER ME
MR KETTRIDGE HAD A JEWELER'S MAGNIFYING GLASS STUCK IN ONE EYE AND IT GAVE HIM A MOST GROTESQUE APPEARANCE AS HE GLANCED FROM THE WHEELS SPRINGS AND LEVERS SPREAD OUT IN FRONT OF HIM OVER TO COLONEL ASHLEY
SO THERE IS NO HARM IN MY TELLING YOU ABOUT IT
I'LL TELL EM AT THE DESK
IT STOOD UP ON ITS HAUNCHES AND BEGAN TO BITE AT THE WIRES OF THE CAGE
STOP WORRYING I'LL TRY COLONEL DON'T TRY--DO IT ONE QUESTION WELL ONE ONLY
BUT TOM--HE'S THE LITTLE JOCKEY DAD GOT A PLACE FOR AS TRAIN-BOY--MET HIM ON THE EXPRESS AND LEARNED THAT THE COLONEL WAS THE GREAT DETECTIVE
JAMES DARCY AND AMY MASON WERE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED THOUGH THIS FACT WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW AND MADE QUITE A SENSATION WHEN DARCY ADMITTED IT AFTER HIS ARREST
AS FOR YOU COLONEL THERE YOU GO AGAIN
HUMPH
FOR A MOMENT HE STARED AT THE WORDS
CARROLL AND THONG NOW THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES THINK THEY HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY NEED AND THE PROSECUTOR AGREES WITH THEM I GUESS STILL WE MAY BE ABLE TO COMBAT THAT OBSERVED THE COLONEL
DID YOU EVER READ DE MAUPASSANT'S DIAMOND NECKLACE I NEVER DID I'D ADVISE YOU TO
ALMOST ANY ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIS STORY--IT SOUNDS STRAIGHT ENOUGH--AND YET I CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
I WANT TO GET THE BEST DETECTIVE IN THE COUNTRY TO WORK ON THE CASE AND PROVE THAT JIMMIE DIDN'T DO THIS--THIS TERRIBLE THING OF WHICH HE IS ACCUSED HE ISN'T EXACTLY ACCUSED YET AS I UNDERSTAND IT MISS MASON OH WELL IT'S JUST AS BAD
THEN CAME THE LEGAL SEPARATION
THEN COME THOSE OF HER MAID JANE METSON
EITHER THEY HAVE BEEN CHANGED LATELY OR SOME SUDDEN JAR OR MISPLACEMENT BROUGHT THEM IN CONTACT WITH A LIVE CIRCUIT WHAT WERE THE WIRES FOR ASKED MR KETTRIDGE
IT WON'T HELP OR HINDER THE SOLVING OF THE MYSTERY
TICKLISH BUSINESS WHEN A MAN GOES OUT WALKING WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND STEPS ON HER CROSS
WELL I MUST SEE WHAT I CAN DO
I WAS AFTER HIM FOR THE MURDER OF MRS DARCY WHERE I THOUGHT HE GOT THE DIAMOND CROSS
THEN CAME THE LEGAL SEPARATION AND THE PARTING
I'M KNOWN HERE AS BRENTNALL AND IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU JUST USE THAT
NOW IN THIS CASE GRAFTON MAY HAVE WANTED SOMETHING FROM MRS DARCY SHE WASN'T WILLING TO DO
JUST NOW AS I SAY I'M NOT IN THIS CASE
I WONDER FROM HIS PRIVATE OFFICE INTO WHICH HE HAD USHERED THE COLONEL HE LOOKED DOWN THE STORE
HELLO DOC WAS THE GENIAL GREETING FOR DOCTOR WARREN WAS MORE THAN A PHYSICIAN
THIS CERTAINLY GETS ME
I TAKE IT THEN THAT YOU AND THE LADY WERE OUT TOGETHER WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING IT I HOPE HE DOESN'T KNOW OF IT FOR THOUGH ON MY HONOR THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN OUR BEING TOGETHER IT MIGHT BE HARD TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU--PARTICULARLY IF HE WERE JEALOUS AS MANY HUSBANDS ARE
HOW IS AMY WHY SHE'S VERY WELL THE LAST I SAW OF HER
I MUST SEE TO IT THE COLONEL FELL INTO A REVERIE
REALLY I WAS SO DISTRESSED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
NOT FOR A MINUTE DID I EXPECT TO RUN ACROSS YOU HERE COLONEL AS NOT THAT NAME SPOTTY IF YOU PLEASE AND THE FISHERMAN-DETECTIVE SMILED IN EASY FASHION
LORD
AND ARE YOU SURE YOUR FATHER DAD'S WITH ME IN THIS--WITH ME AND YOU
CUT IT OUT
AND I'VE KNOWN MURDER TO BE DONE ON SLIGHTER PROVOCATION
ASKED JOKINGLY BY HIS CRONIES WHERE HE HAD GOT THE MONEY HE HAD SAID A LADY GAVE IT TO HIM
BUT I CAME TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE I SUPPOSE SO
SHE FLASHED A LOOK AT THE DETECTIVE THAT MADE HIM STAND TO HIS FULL MILITARY HEIGHT AND BEARING AND THEN SHE SAID
YEAH I IS COLONEL AND A NEGRO WITH A PICTURESQUE FRINGE OF WHITE KINKY HAIR SHUFFLED FROM THE PORTER'S QUARTERS WHERE HE HAD BEEN ENJOYING A QUIET CHAT WITH THE BLACK KNIGHT OF THE WHISK BROOM
THE FAMILY OF CYNTHIA LARCH--AT LEAST HER MOTHER--WAS SOCIALLY AMBITIOUS AND SHE SAW THAT IF HER DAUGHTER BECAME THE WIFE OF LANGFORD LARCH HIS WEALTH COMBINED WITH HER OWN FAMILY CONNECTIONS WOULD GIVE HER A CHANCE NOT ONLY TO SHINE IN THE WAY SHE DESIRED BUT TO ECLIPSE SOME SATELLITES WHO HAD OUTSHONE HER IN THE SOCIAL FIRMAMENT
I KNEW IT
NOW SHAG I DON'T WANT T BE BODDERED WIF NUFFIN I DON'T WANT T READ NO PAPERS
DO YOU REALLY SUSPECT HIM OF THE MURDER JACK I DON'T KNOW WAS THE FRANK ANSWER AS CHET WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE BY THE GAS LOG
GLAD TO KNOW YOU COLONEL ASHLEY SAID DONOVAN
I'LL HAVE THE PLACE ALL WIRED OVER
MY DEAR YOUNG LADY THIS IS NOTHING
AND YET THE DETECTIVE SEEMED TO MUSE FOR A MOMENT
HOW IS SHE COLONEL WERE THE FIRST WORDS OF THE PRISONER WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE WITH A DETECTIVE FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE SEATED A FEW CHAIRS AWAY
AND THE MONEY HARRY KING WENT OUT AND GOT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER WAS GIVEN HIM AS HE BOASTED AT THE TIME BY A WOMAN
WHAT'S THE USE A MOMENT LATER PULLING HIS CHAIR BENEATH AN ELECTRIC LIGHT HE BEGAN TO READ THE ACCOUNT OF THE MURDER
I--I CAN'T STAND IT TO HAVE HER LOSE FAITH IN ME I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
I'M NOT SURE ANYTHING IS TAKEN
THUS YOU HAVING FOUND AND FITTED FOR THE PLACE AND DEPTH THEREOF THEN GO HOME AND PREPARE YOUR GROUND-BAIT WHICH IS NEXT TO THE FRUIT OF YOUR LABORS TO BE REGARDED I WONDER MUSED THE COLONEL IF MY GROUND BAIT IS ALL PREPARED
WELL THIS WAS MRS LARCH'S CROSS
IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED I KNOW
FOR IT'S ALWAYS GOOD WEATHER WHEN GOOD FELLOWS GET TOGETHER OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE NOT UNMUSICAL STRAINS WELLED OUT FROM ONE OF THE PRIVATE ROOMS OPENING OFF THE GRILL OF THE HOMESTEAD
OCCASIONALLY AS ALMOST PERFORCE HE HAD TO HE DRANK A LITTLE WINE
IT TOOK SPOTTY'S SKILL
IT WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER IF WE CAN
THE STORE WON'T OPEN TO-DAY BUT THE POLICE WANT TO SEE EVERY ONE
HERE RILEY GO AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A RAT IN ONE OF THE TRAPS
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE MORE THAN TWO OR THREE KNOW THAT THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
THANKS OLD TOP
DO YOU CARE TO HEAR ABOUT IT CERTAINLY MY DEAR KENNETH IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE DARCY MURDER AND SO I DIDN'T MENTION IT TO YOU BEFORE GO ON IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
YOU--YOU--HERE GASPED THE DETECTIVE
I'VE GIVEN UP DETECTIVE WORK BUT AND A MOMENT LATER AMY MASON SANK LIMPLY INTO THE COLONEL'S ARMS
WE'RE NOT PAID FOR TELLING IT--LIKE THE REPORTERS AND HE GRINNED AT DALEY OF THE TIMES
COLONEL ASHLEY SAT IN SILENCE IN THE BOOTH MUSING
THE PROHIBITION IS OFF SO TO SPEAK
WELL IF HE GOES TO NEW YORK I GO TOO SAID THE COLONEL GRIMLY
WHAT'S THAT NOISE THEY ALL LISTENED--THEY ALL HEARD IT
THE STORY SPREAD OVER HALF THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES AND IT WAS NOTED THAT THE EVENING THE PAPER CAME OUT A DINNER WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE LAWYERS CLUB AT THE HOMESTEAD WAS UNEXPECTEDLY POSTPONED
THIS YOUNG LADY RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW ON HER HEAD BY HER FALL AND YOUR COUSIN YOU FORGET THE STAB WOUND COLONEL NO I DIDN'T EXACTLY FORGET IT
THE COLONEL BEGAN TO LEAF OVER THE BRAIN TABLETS OF HIS MEMORY SYSTEM
HE HAD A LOT BUT MOST OF IT IS GONE I HADN'T HEARD THAT WELL IT'S TRUE
THEN COLONEL ASHLEY THRUST THE IMPROVISED SPEAR THROUGH THE WIRES OF THE CAGE AND LIGHTLY PUNCTURED THE RAT WHICH GAVE A PROTESTING SQUEAK
ONLY THE WATCH IN THE DEAD WOMAN'S HAND WAS TICKING AND THAT SHOWED APPROXIMATELY THE RIGHT TIME--A LITTLE AFTER SIX O'CLOCK
A WHOLE LOT MO OH WELL HANG IT ALL
SKIP SPOTTY
THE OLD LADY'S DEAD--MURDERED IT LOOKS LIKE--AND WHAT'S THAT INTERRUPTED THONG
HU
HE HAS AND IT'S WELL STOCKED
TROUBLE NOT YET COLONEL THOUGH THERE MAY BE
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO GENTLEMEN OBSERVED THE DETECTIVE WHO HAD ONE FINGER KEEPING A CERTAIN PLACE IN A CERTAIN GREEN BOOK
TELL HIM EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
BUT IF THE OLD SALMON GETS TO THE SEA AND HE RECOVERS HIS STRENGTH AND COMES NEXT SUMMER TO THE SAME RIVER IF IT BE POSSIBLE
SUCH THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
GAD BUT HE'S GOT A WAD SOMEBODY WHISPERED AS KING PULLED FORTH A GREAT ROLL OF BILLS TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS
WELL BOYS WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT ANOTHER MURDER ASKED COLONEL ASHLEY WHEN HE HAD PASSED OVER SOME OF HIS CIGARS THE FLAVOR OF WHICH THE TWO HEADQUARTERS MEN HAD BEEN LONGING TO TASTE AGAIN
A NUMBER OF MEN ABOUT TOWN AS THEY LIKED TO BE CALLED WERE IN AND COLONEL ASHLEY WAS SIPPING HIS JULEP WHEN THERE ENTERED MR KETTRIDGE THE RELATIVE OF MRS DARCY WHOSE JEWELRY SHOP HE WAS MANAGING PENDING A SETTLEMENT OF HER ESTATE
I HEARD HIM TELLING KING ABOUT IT
IF WE HAD A BETTER LIGHT IN HERE IT MIGHT HELP I'LL BRING ONE OF THE TWO-HUNDRED WATT BULBS WE USE DOWN IN THE OFFICE SAID THE WARDEN WHO HAD JOINED THE LITTLE GROUP
THE BIG REGULATOR INDICATED 10:22
BUT HE DID KILL HER
IT IS TRUE I HAD THE WIRES RUN IN SECRETLY AS I DIDN'T WANT MY COUSIN TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE HER OUT A PRESENT
WHO IS IT
HE GLANCED TO WHERE HIS RODS AND FLIES WERE GATHERING DUST
MR YOUNG AND I TALKED OF THIS BEFORE BUT DIDN'T SETTLE IT NO
IT WAS MORE OF A COLCHESTER INSTITUTION
I HAD NOT SET AN ALARM THOUGH I WANTED TO GET UP EARLY TO DO A LITTLE REPAIR JOB I HAD PROMISED FOR EARLY THIS MORNING
HUM YES
IT WAS NOW CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT AND THE EXCITEMENT OVER THE ACCIDENT TO SALLIE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AFTER THE CLOSING HOUR FOR THE STORE HAD SUBSIDED NOT AS MUCH OF A CROWD HAVING GATHERED AT THAT TIME OF THE EVENING AS WOULD HAVE DONE EARLIER
I THOUGHT SHE WAS STABBED AND HER SKULL FRACTURED SHE HAD BOTH THOSE INJURIES IT IS TRUE
WHUT KIND OF A BOOK DID YO OFFER DE COLONEL JEST NOW A DETECTIVE STORY
THERE WERE RAMIFICATIONS FROM THESE BEGINNINGS--SUCH AS THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME
KING WILL NOT RUN AWAY AND IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION HE IS LIKELY TO PICK A QUARREL WITH YOU IF YOU MENTION THE MURDER TO HIM
YOU DISGUISED YOURSELF VERY WELL BUT THE FRECKLES SHOW THROUGH YES DAMN EM HEARTILY EXPLODED THE GUNMAN
HOW ABOUT IT JIM AND HE LOOKED OVER AT HALIDAY FROM THE COURT HOUSE
OTHERWISE YOU'D HAVE TO GET AN ORDER FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
IN FACT THE VICTIM USUALLY LINGERS FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN AN UNCONSCIOUS STATE
I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU YES OR I WILL COME TO SEE YOU MISS MASON NO I HAD RATHER COME TO YOUR HOTEL IF YOU WILL MEET ME IN THE LADIES PARLOR
CARROLL SHOOK HIS HEAD IN NEGATION
LOOK ABOUT AS YOU PLEASE WAS THE COURTEOUS INVITATION HE RECEIVED AND THE MAN AVAILED HIMSELF OF IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO IF SHE WENT BACK ON ME
I'LL TAKE YOU BACK TAKE ME BACK
I HAD DONE SOME SPECIAL WORK ON MAKING NECKLACES FOR HER CUSTOMERS AND SHE HAD PROMISED IF THEY WERE PLEASED TO PAY ME EXTRA FOR THE EXCLUSIVE DESIGNS I GOT UP
IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR ANY OF THE JEWELRY CLERKS TO REPORT
WE WILL ASSUME THAT SINGA PHUT FINDING SOME TRIFLING THING THE MATTER WITH HIS DEVILISH WATCH BROUGHT IT TO THE DARCY SHOP WHERE HE WAS FAIRLY WELL KNOWN
RIGHT YEAH IN COLCHESTER WHERE WE DONE COME T HAB PUFFICK REST AN QUIET AN FISHIN JUST LAIK YO DONE SAID ON DE TRAIN HUMPH
IT SURE DOES IT EVIDENTLY WENT RIGHT TO THE HEART JUST AS IN SINGA PHUT'S CASE OBSERVED THE COLONEL GRIMLY
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME HERE
I'M IN IT AND I MUST SEE IT THROUGH
I MUST LOOK IT UP
IF WE HAD A CAT NOW OR A RAT EASY ENOUGH TO GET A RAT INTERPOSED THE WARDEN
IT MADE THE CELL VERY BRIGHT AND BY THE GLARE THE COLONEL GATHERED UP A NUMBER OF THE CIGARETTES
SHERE ALI SINGA PHUT'S PARTNER HAD BEEN FOUND LYING ON THE FLOOR OF THE LITTLE CURIOSITY SHOP WITH HIS HEAD CRUSHED IN
YES YOU MAY BE PLAYING A DOUBLE GAME MR AARON GRAFTON CHAPTER IX INDICTED WELL SPOTTY I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU
A TEST OF BOTH THE LOYALTY OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FATHER AND OH YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT DAD
THE COLONEL HAD SEEMED VERY MUCH IN EARNEST
NO ALIMONY NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED
IT WAS TICKING LOUDLY
IT'S A PLAIN AND SORDID STORY ENOUGH WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER REFUSAL OF ALIMONY AND THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HE AND HIS COUSIN HAD QUARRELED SOMEWHAT BITTERLY OVER MONEY AND ABOUT HIS REFUSAL TO GIVE UP WORK ON HIS ELECTRIC LATHE
SHE--WELL SHE SNEERED AT YOU FOR THINKING OF MARRYING ME--A POOR MAN--AND AS IF MONEY COUNTED JIMMIE BOY CRIED THE GIRL FONDLY
BUT AS THE DETECTIVE WAS CROSSING A CROWDED STREET A BIG AUTO TRUCK SWUNG AROUND A CORNER AND HE FOUND HIMSELF DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH AS HE STEPPED OFF THE CURB
THAT IS A POINT I HAVE YET TO CONSIDER
YES SAH WE'RE GOING FISHING TOMORROW IS WE COLONEL
HE RESUMED PLAY ONLY TO LOSE AND HAD STAGGERED OUT INTO THE GRAY DAWN WHICH WAS THE LAST HIS COMPANIONS HAD SEEN OF HIM
THERE'S MRS DARCY'S MAID--JANE METSON
DO YOU THINK HE KNEW THE DEADLY NATURE OF THE WATCH WENT ON THE DETECTIVE
CAN HE AND SPOTTY BE UP TO SOME TRICK BETWEEN THEM AND DID THE GUNMAN GET AWAY WITH THE CROSS
I THINK I KNOW THE LADY TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED THE BOY TALKED WITH THE MAN A LITTLE NODDED HIS HEAD AS IF UNDERSTANDING AND THEN STARTED OFF UP THE TRACKS TOWARD A PATH THAT LED ACROSS A FIELD AND TOWARD A CLUSTER OF VILLAGE HOUSES
WELL I DON'T LAIKS FO T TELL YO COLONEL AND SHAG SEEMED UNEASY
I'LL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOU IN CASE YOU NEED ME AND DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF HARRY KING WAS THE PARTING ADMONITION
BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE AND ALSO OLD FRIENDS OF MRS LARCH OBSERVED THAT THE SMILE DID NOT LONG LINGER ON HER FACE
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT UNTIL I READ ABOUT THE MURDER THE MURDER EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
WHEN I GO TO SEE MISS MASON YOU ARE GOING TO SEE AMY CRIED THE PRISONER EAGERLY
NOW YOU'D BETTER GET READY TO LEAVE YOU MEAN LOCK THE PLACE UP OH NO SOMEBODY'LL HAVE TO STAY HERE NOT ME INTERRUPTED MULLIGAN
CERTAINLY KING AND LARCH HAVE BEEN PRETTY THICK OF LATE AND LARCH'S BAILING HARRY OUT SHOWED THERE WAS MORE THAN MERE FRIENDLINESS IN IT
JIMMIE BOY AMY
BEFORE THIS HOWEVER LARCH HAD MISSED HIS WIFE'S DIAMOND CROSS AND CHARGED HER WITH HAVING DISPOSED OF IT
ANSWER ME COLONEL ASHLEY WITH A DRAMATIC GESTURE POINTED TO THE GLITTERING ORNAMENT THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BETWEEN HIM AND THE NEW YORK CROOK
HE MAY HAVE COME TO THE STORE LATE AT NIGHT INTENDING TO WARN HIM TO BE CAREFUL WELL ASSUMING THAT WHAT NEXT ASKED JACK YOUNG
THE COLONEL KNEW THAT SPOTTY NEVER WOULD TELL UNTIL HE WANTED TO BUT IT DID NOT DETER HIM
IN THE MORNING I'LL GET SHAG TO LAY OUT MY RODS AND WE'LL GO FISHING
I WANT TO SURPRISE HIM
I HAVE BEEN GIVING IT MORE TIME THAN USUAL BECAUSE IT IS NEARLY FINISHED AND I WANT TO GET IT READY TO SHOW AT A BIG EASTERN JEWELRY CONVENTION AND WHAT WAS THE TALK ABOUT MONEY WELL MRS DARCY OWED ME ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS
SHE WALKED AWAY RAPIDLY THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWING UNSEEN
OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
AND I'VE GOT A CITY EDITOR WHO HAS A TEMPER LIKE A BEAR WITH A SORE NOSE IN HUCKLEBERRY TIME
SAY DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS KILLING THAT YOU'RE KEEPING BACK FROM US HE TOOK A STEP NEARER DARCY--A THREATENING STEP IT WOULD SEEM FROM THE FACT THAT THE JEWELRY WORKER DREW BACK AS IF IN ALARM
OH FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T PUT ANY WRONG CONSTRUCTION ON IT
I WONDER IF THAT IS A COINCIDENCE OR--SOMETHING ELSE
IF I WAS T TELL YO HIS REAL NAME YO'D OPEN YO EYES WIDER YET
UP THE HEIGHTS WALKED THE LEADING PAIR SEEMINGLY UNAWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE BUT THEMSELVES
DON'T GET SENTIMENTAL I CAN'T HELP IT COLONEL
IT WAS ONLY UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS THAT VISITORS WERE ALLOWED TO SEE THE JEWELRY WORKER
GOOD LORD
HE SEEMED UNEASY--HE LOOKED UNEASY AND IT REQUIRED NO VERY ASTUTE MIND TO KNOW THAT HE WAS UNEASY--OUT OF HIS ELEMENT
COME ON DARCY CAUGHT SIGHT OF AMY BEFORE SHE SAW HIM FOR HE APPROACHED FROM BEHIND A LINE OF OTHER PRISONERS EXERCISING IN THE SPACE BEFORE THEIR CELLS
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A JULEP DELIGHTED I'M SURE AND THEY SAT DOWN AT ONE OF THE HALF-ENCLOSED TABLES IN THE GRILL AND ORDERED FOOD AND DRINK
THEN WHAT'S THIS TALK ABOUT THE STATUE--NOT WANTING IT IN THE HOUSE--_WHOSE HOUSE THE HOUSE I HOPE TO LIVE IN WITH MY WIFE--MISS AMY MASON ANSWERED DARCY AND HE SPOKE IN CALM CONTRAST TO HIS FORMER EXCITEMENT WE ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED IN THE FALL HE WENT ON
YES I DID KILL HER
YOU'D BETTER PLAN TO STAY ALL NIGHT IF I DON'T GET BACK WANT TO SAY WHERE YOU'RE GOING I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER
FOR A MOMENT THE COLONEL WAS SUSPICIOUS
HE HAS DONE BUSINESS WITH ME FOR SOME YEARS IS HE ALL RIGHT--SAFE--NOT ONE OF THEM GARS--YOU KNOW THE FELLOWS THAT USE A SILK CORD TO STRANGLE YOU WITH ASKED THONG WHO HAD SOME IMAGINATION REGARDING GARROTERS
FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS HER HEART BEATING--IT SOUNDED SO
HE'LL BE ALONG SOON
WHO'S THAT AT THE DOOR HE ASKED SHARPLY FOR A KNOCK AS OF AUTHORITY SOUNDED--DIFFERENT FROM THE AIMLESS AND IMPATIENT KICKINGS AND TAPPINGS OF THE WET THRONG OUTSIDE
WITH THE SUICIDE OF THE EAST INDIAN THE CASE HAD BEEN DROPPED BY DONOVAN AND THE AUTHORITIES THEY TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT SINGA PHUT HAD KILLED SHERE ALI AND THEN ENDED HIS OWN LIFE BY HELP FROM OUTSIDE IN GETTING POISON
JUST AS I THOUGHT THE COLONEL WHISPERED TO HIMSELF
BUT I DON'T SAY THAT THERE ISN'T SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN
AND IF YOU ARE WITHOUT ANY ONE TO HELP YOU OFF WITH YOUR LUGGAGE AS IT IS RAINING AND LIKELY TO CONTINUE OH THANK YOU SIR BUT JABEZ WILL MEET ME
PERHAPS I HAVE ACTED FOOLISHLY BUT OF LATE I HAVE SEEN HER QUITE OFTEN
THE BUTT OF HIS GUN PROJECTED BEHIND HIM AND AS DR WARREN MOVED THE STATUE INTO THE LIGHT OF THE JEWELRY STORE CHANDELIERS THEY ALL SAW CLINGING TO THE STOCK OF THE GUN SOME STRAGGLING WHITE HAIRS
HE'LL GIVE US WHAT'S RIGHT
I'LL GET MY RODS IN SHAPE TO GO FISHING TO-MORROW
JIMMIE BOY TO THE ETERNAL CREDIT OF THE KEEPER AND THE DETECTIVE BE IT SAID THAT AT THIS MOMENT THEY FOUND SOMETHING OF GREAT INTEREST IN THE CALENDAR THAT HUNG ON THE OPPOSITE WALL WHILE KENNETH TALKED EARNESTLY WITH THE WARDEN
WELL THEN YOU WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
THERE MAY BE NO ONE AT HOME IT WAS EVIDENT A LITTLE LATER THAT AT LEAST NO ONE INTENDED TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE AND THE COLONEL HUNG UP HE RECEIVER
THOUGH IT WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT HAD BEEN AND THOUGH PATRONAGE OF THE BETTER SORT HAD FALLEN OFF CONSIDERABLY IT WAS STILL A JOLLY ENOUGH SORT OF PLACE OF ITS CHARACTER TO BE IN
THAT TICKER KILLED THE DOG
PORTER SEND MY MAN HERE
SHE TREATED US PRETTY DECENT TOO
WHY DIDN'T HE CONFESS TO ME BASSET WELL I GUESS IT'S JUST AS HE SAYS--HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPLIT ON A PAL
RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE
I USED TO LIKE IT THOUGH
I HAVE KNOWN HIM A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HE KNEW MRS DARCY QUITE WELL
SHAG ASKED THE COLONEL STILL CHUCKLING WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT NINCOMPOOP HAD THE INFERNAL AUDACITY TO OFFER ME IN THE WAY OF A BOOK I AIN'T GOT NO IDEA COLONEL--NOT TH LEASTEST IN TH WORLD HE OFFERED ME A--DETECTIVE STORY SHAG OH MAH GOOD LORD COLONEL
THAT'S ALL I GATHERED THEN
ASKED AS TO THE NATURE OF THE DISPUTE KING HAD SAID HE HAD HEARD MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THE NAME AMY THERE WAS ALSO SOMETHING SAID ABOUT MONEY AND AN ELECTRIC LATHE NATURALLY THERE WAS AN INQUIRY AS TO WHO AMY WAS AND WHAT WAS MEANT BY THE ELECTRIC LATHE
WE FOUND HIM DEAD IN HIS CELL HALF AN HOUR AGO CHAPTER XIV THE HIDDEN WIRES DONOVAN LOOKED AT THE DEPUTY AS IF ABOUT TO DISPUTE THE STATEMENT
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS A DETECTIVE AND STOPPING AT THE ADAMS HOUSE HE TOLD ME SHE POINTED TO THE LANKY YOUTH
I HAD FIXED MY MIND ON THE FACT THAT I WANTED TO GET UP AT FIVE-THIRTY AND I THINK IT WAS JUST A QUARTER TO SIX WHEN I GOT UP
I'D RATHER YOU'D HAVE THEM AND HE SEEMED TO WEAKEN AS IF WITH ROMANCE WHEN IT CAME TO THIS SENTIMENT
I'M POSITIVE HE DIDN'T SIR AND THE COLONEL DREW HIMSELF UP AND LOOKED UNCOMPROMISINGLY AT THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE
A MAN SUCH AS HE IS DOESN'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT FOR FUN
OH JIMMIE BOY
BUT THOUGH THE WALL BLOCKED HIS VISION DARCY SAW THROUGH AND BEYOND IT
IN A WAY THE DISCOVERY OF THE ODD COIN HELPED IN SOLVING THE MYSTERY FOR I KEPT MY HELPER JACK YOUNG AT THE HOMESTEAD AFTER THAT AND IT WAS HEARING KING AND LARCH TALKING ABOUT THE DIAMOND CROSS THAT GAVE ME JUST THE CLEW I WANTED
WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH HASTE TO GET AWAY UM
THE COLONEL PASSED ON AHEAD SLOUCHED ACROSS THE STREET ONCE MORE AND LAGGED BEHIND SO THAT HE MIGHT FOLLOW
I THINK I SEE IT NOW THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
YOU WILL WON'T YOU
SHE BACKED AWAY FROM HIM TOWARD THE OPEN SAFE INTENDING IT WOULD SEEM TO PUT THE VALUABLE ORNAMENT IN THERE AND LOCK IT UP WHEN LARCH STRUCK AT HER
I'LL SEND FOR KETTRIDGE
I--DID--IT
I KNOWED IT HAD SUFFIN T DO WIF ANGLE WORMS
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN FORGETTING--THE LITTLE FISH
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD NOT BE WISE TO BE SEEN TALKING TO YOU HERE WAS THE WOMAN'S LOW REPLY
NO INDEEDY
OLD LADY DARCY'S DEAD
BIG DIAMOND CROSS FOUND ON HIM
IN FACT I KNOW HE DIDN'T
THE GRAND JURY WAS SETTING CONSIDERING THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE PRISONER AND AGAINST OTHERS ACCUSED OF VARIOUS CRIMES
I SUPPOSE THE LADY--THERE IS A LADY IN IT OF COURSE QUESTIONED THE COLONEL
I CAME HERE TO FISH AND FIRST CLICK OF THE REEL I GO NOSING AROUND ON THE TRAIL OF A MURDER WHEN I VOWED I WOULDN'T EVEN DREAM OF A CASE
SHE IS GOING TO MEET HIM JUST AS SHE PROMISED IN THE NOTE THOUGH IT MUST BE GALLING TO HER PRIDE MURMURED THE OLD DETECTIVE
THE KIND OF POISON THEY USE IS CALCULATED TO WORK SWIFTLY IN THE GLARING LIGHT FROM THE NITROGEN BULB THEY STOOD IN THE CELL OF THE DEAD MAN GATHERED ABOUT THE CAGE OF THE RAT--A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON
YES I'LL STOP THIS DETECTIVE WORK
I'LL GIVE YOU TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO GET OUT OF TOWN
NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD--NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
HE HAD BEEN COUNTY PHYSICIAN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
THAT'S SO SPOTTY
BUT PLEASE WON'T YOU HELP ME
UP TO THE LAST MINUTE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WOULD AND HE WAS EVEN BROUGHT DOWN FROM JAIL TO THE COURTROOM WHERE A GREAT CROWD HAD ASSEMBLED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE OPENING OF THE NOW CELEBRATED CASE
THERE OUGHT TO BE GOOD FISHING AFTER THIS RAIN SAID THE COLONEL WITH A REGRETFUL SIGH AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS RODS AND FLIES
IN FACT I'D BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HELP IN THIS INVESTIGATION IF YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING CROOKED OH NOT AT ALL
WHAT A MAN BABBLES WHEN THE WINE IS IN AND THE WIT IS OUT WOULDN'T BE MUCH USE IN A COURT OF LAW
SO WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MRS DARCY WAS FIRST STUNNED BY A BLOW ON THE HEAD WHICH EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE KILLED HER I THINK DEATH ALMOST AT ONCE FOLLOWED THE STAB WOUND COULD BOTH HAVE BEEN DELIVERED BY THE SAME PERSON OF COURSE
IT'S THE SAME PLACE MURMURED THE MANAGER WHAT IS ASKED THE DETECTIVE
LAST NIGHT'S QUARREL WASN'T THE FIRST THOUGH SHE WAS ESPECIALLY BITTER OVER MY WORK ON THE LATHE
NOT ANOTHER WORD
BUT THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO LOOK FOR IT NOW
THE HAIR SPRING I THINK HAD BECOME CAUGHT UP AND IT RAN VERY FAST
THAT'S THE ONE THAT DID THE BUSINESS SAID THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE SHOWING ONE CANDLESTICK WITH SOMETHING DARK AND UNPLEASANT ON THE HEAVIER END
IF YOU HEARD ALL OF THE RUMORS I DID THEY WOULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING FROM AN I.W.W
THERE ARE TWO HAPPY ONES IF EVER THERE WERE ANY AND HE MOTIONED TO AMY AND DARCY WALKING SLOWLY ACROSS THE MEADOW IN THE GOLDEN GLOW OF THE SETTING SUN
AND DAD SAID WHEN I TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS GOING--DAD SAID HE'D DO THE SAME
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AT ANY RATE DARCY AFTER HAVING BEEN AROUSED BY WHAT HE KNEW NOT HAD GONE TO SLEEP AGAIN ONLY TO AWAKEN TO HURRY DOWN TO DO THE REPAIR WORK ON THE WATCH OF THE EAST INDIAN--THE WATCH THAT WAS FOUND SO UNCANNILY TICKING IN THE OTHERWISE SILENT JEWELRY STORE CLASPED IN THE HAND OF THE DEAD WOMAN
THERE'S BEEN A MURDER A MURDER KING'S VOICE WAS MORE CERTAIN NOW
DR WARREN REPORTED THE POLICEMAN CALLING UPSTAIRS TO CARROLL AND THONG
BELOW THE HILL AT ONE PLACE CUTTING DEEP INTO IT AND MAKING A PRECIPITOUS CLIFF WAS A LITTLE RIVER
DARCY YOU'VE GOT GOOD FRIENDS I KNOW IT COLONEL AND I COUNT YOU AMONG THE BEST THANKS
I--I DON'T LIKE TO GO NEAR HER--I NEVER COULD BEAR THE SIGHT OF DEAD FOLKS--NOT EVEN MY OWN FATHER
I CAN SEE THAT
HE HOPED HE SAID TO BE ABLE TO GET IN AND PROCURE THE PRESENT FOR HIS WIFE
IT WOULD BE A SACRILEGE
TO APPROACH HIM NOW WOULD ONLY BE TO DEFEAT YOUR OWN PLAN THAT IS IF YOU HAVE ONE
YOU WILL HELP US WON'T YOU AND AGAIN SHE HELD OUT HER HANDS APPEALINGLY
WHO'S ASLEEP BROKE IN THE THICK VOICE OF THE WASTRAL
HE OWNS THE EMPORIUM THAT BIG DEPARTMENT STORE YES
YOU--YOU'LL GO WITH ME FALTERED DARCY
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE JUST AS YOU GAVE ME MINE NOW
I AM SORRY BUT I YOU DIDN'T STRIKE HIM DID YOU ASKED THE OLD LADY REPROACHFULLY
DON'T SAY I'M HERE UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHO IT IS YES SAH COLONEL THE COLORED SERVANT UNHOOKED THE RECEIVER AND LISTENED A MOMENT
BESIDES THIS AMY WAS WELL OFF IN HER OWN RIGHT HER UNCLE HAVING LEFT HER A HALF INTEREST IN A VALUABLE MINE
COLONEL HE SAID SLOWLY MOST OF WHAT YOU HAS BEEN SPIELIN IS LIKE THE LAWYER GUYS GIT OFF IN COURT
THE POLICE WILL BE HERE AS SOON AS WE SEND EM WORD
SINGA PHUT'S BODY HAD BEEN REMOVED TO ANOTHER PART OF THE JAIL
HE'S DAID I RECKON
I DIDN'T CLAIM THE WATCH DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AS I HAVE CAME THE GENTLE ANSWER AS AMY GAZED WITH SHINING EYES AT THE MAN BESIDE HER
THIS GETS ME
GUESS HE'S GOING DOWN AND OUT BY THE WRONG ROUTE
SHE TOLD HIM SHE WOULD LEAVE HIM
THE COLONEL WAS SUFFICIENTLY FAMILIAR WITH HIS ALIAS NOT TO BETRAY SURPRISE WHEN IT WAS USED
JUST BECAUSE YOU USED TO WALK THERE IN YOUR--IN OTHER DAYS HE SUBSTITUTED QUICKLY IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T NOW IS IT ONLY--_MEMORIES HER VOICE WAS VERY LOW
MAYBE IT'S THE MEN FROM HEADQUARTERS IT WAS--CARROLL AND THONG WHO ALWAYS TEAMED IT WHEN THERE WAS A CASE OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE AS THIS SEEMED TO BE
AND BY THE ETERNAL YOU'VE GOT TO
COME CALLED OUT THE COLONEL
THEN JUST AS DARCY HAD EXPECTED SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND MOAN WHEN SHE HEARD HER MISTRESS WAS DEAD AND REFUSED TO COME FROM HER ROOM
YOU--YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GUILTY BECAUSE OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT DO YOU IF I DID I WOULDN'T STILL BE HANDLING YOUR CASE MR DARCY WAS THE ANSWER
I'LL GET AT IT RIGHT AWAY
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN I'M NOT SURE OF THAT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY
HE WAS SITTING AFTER THE ADJOURNMENT IN HIS HOTEL ROOM
AFTER THE FIRST START CAUSED BY THE NEEDLE PRICK THE RODENT AGAIN SHRANK BACK INTO ITS CORNER
DOWN HE WENT AND THE TRUCK THUNDERED STRAIGHT AT HIM
SO IT WAS TO FIND THE DIAMOND CROSS YOU VISITED THE STORE OF THE MURDERED WOMAN YES
NO I'LL LET HIS SWEETHEART TAKE IT TO HIM
HIS EYES LOST SOMETHING OF THEIR BLEARY MISUNDERSTANDING LOOK AND TOOK ON A DANGEROUS GLINT
A BEAUT CAME RILEY'S VOICE FROM DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND HE CAME IN WITH A WIRE CAGE CONTAINING A LARGE RAT WHICH COWERED IN ONE CORNER OF HIS CELL EVEN AS SINGA PHUT HAD SHRUNK INTO HIS WHEN THE END CAME
OF THE MANY CLOCKS IN THE STORE NOT ONE WAS TICKING AND ALL POINTED TO DIFFERENT HOURS
AND THE TESTIMONY AS TO THIS CAME NOT FROM PERSONS OF HIS OWN NATIONALITY BUT FROM BUSINESS MEN AND OTHERS WHOSE WORDS COULD NOT BE DOUBTED
WHAT ONE WATCH
THEN HARRY KING SEEMINGLY FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAME AWARE THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL IN THE PLACE HE HAD ENTERED
AND IT'S A SORT OF FISHING TOO ISN'T IT YES SAH COLONEL
LATER THAT NIGHT SINGA PHUT A SILENT SHRINKING AND SOMEWHAT PATHETIC FIGURE SLEPT IN A CELL AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
I'M GOING TO BROWSE ABOUT HERE A BIT IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION NOT AT ALL
THE COLONEL LOOKED BACK AND SAW MR GRAFTON DODGING BEHIND A TREE
AT FIRST I HAD MY DOUBTS
I'M RIGHT YEAH
DOESN'T SEEM SO
AN BOY HE SPECIALLY TELL ME NOT T LET HIM BE BODDERED WIF BOOK AGENTS I AIN'T A BOOK AGENT OBJECTED THE TRAIN-BOY
A DIAMOND CROSS
AND WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT BASSET DON'T HANDLE THAT CROSS SO CARELESSLY
SO YOU WANT ME TO TRY TO GET THIS DIAMOND CROSS BELONGING TO THE MARRIED LADY BACK FOR YOU WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S IT WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU WERE ROBBED OF IT I WASN'T ROBBED OF IT
INCIDENTALLY THE VICE CHANCELOR WAS FURIOUS WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THE DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN INSPECTED BY A REPORTER BUT THEN IT WAS TOO LATE
AND IT WASN'T MERE CURIOSITY EITHER
CHAPTER VII THE COLONEL IS SURPRISED THIS SAID COLONEL ASHLEY TO HIMSELF AS HE GLIDED RAPIDLY ALONG THE STREET IS VERY MUCH LIKE OLD TIMES--VERY MUCH
YES I'M GOING TO POMPEY AND IT MAY BE NIGHT WHEN I GET THERE
I CAN EASILY SEE ALL THE PARTS NOW THAT I HAVE TAKEN IT APART AND THE TIME-SETTING ARRANGEMENT IS VERY COMPACT SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE YOU WERE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH YOURSELF ON THE NEEDLE ASKED THE COLONEL QUICKLY
HE COULD NOT HELP THE YOUNG MAN BY MAKING THESE FEW DISCLOSURES NOW
YES I'LL GO THERE AT ONCE WHAT IS IT ASKED JACK AS THE COLONEL HUNG UP THE RECEIVER
I KNOW YOU WERE SPOTTY
WELL I'LL LOOK ABOUT A BIT THEN
DON'T SO MUCH AS SCRATCH YOURSELF THE HUNDREDTH PART OF AN INCH OR WELL YOU SAW SINGA PHUT HE ENDED GRIMLY
THEN IT DOES LOOK BAD FOR HIM IT DOES AND HOW DOES HE BEAR UP UNDER IT VERY WELL
AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE SEEN WITH YOU AGAIN EVER
SOMEBODY TRIED TO SET FIRE TO THE PLACE AW ONLY ONE OF THE GIRLS FAINTED
HER FOLKS WERE AMBITIOUS FOR HER
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WHAT'S THE MATTER
GET AN AUTO YES SAH COLONEL AND SHAG HURRIED DOWN TO THE HOTEL OFFICE
I'VE GOT TO BE SURE OF MY GROUND BEFORE I MAKE TOO MANY MOVES
I KIN FORGET I EVER SAW YOU THAT'S GOOD
I CAN TELL THAT BY THE TYPE OF SMALL SCREWS USED
AGAIN THE WAITER GLIDED UP
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE BEFORE THE COLONEL OR AARON GRAFTON WHO JUST THEN BURST THROUGH THE BUSHES FRINGING THE PATH COULD MAKE A MOVE TO PREVENT HIM LANGFORD LARCH WITH A CRY LIKE THAT OF A STRICKEN BEAST THREW HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY PRECIPICE AND HIS BODY WENT CRASHING DOWN A HUNDRED FEET INTO THE SWIRLING WATERS BELOW
AND YOU NEEDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO MY FRIEND ABOUT THE FISHING
I REGRET EXCEEDINGLY THAT I STARTLED YOU
JES LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW
YOU MAY NEED IT YES
POOR CHET GNAWING THE WATCH WHICH HE WAS PLAYING WITH--WORRYING IT AS HE WOULD A BONE--MUST HAVE BITTEN ON THE RIGHT PLACE
AS FOR THE KILLING OF SHERE ALI THAT OCCASIONED ONLY PASSING INTEREST THE MURDERED MAN NOT BEING WELL KNOWN
HE LEANED OVER IT AND PUT THE BACKS OF HIS HARD FINGERS ON THE WHITE WRINKLED AND SHRUNKEN CHEEKS
NOR WAS THAT SIDE OF HIS BUSINESS EVER ACCENTUATED
IT IS NOT INSTANTANEOUS BUT WHO WOULD HAVE STRUCK OR STABBED HER AFTER THAT ASKED MR KETTRIDGE
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT HOW HE CAME BY THAT COIN
GOOD-BYE AND HE WAS GONE
WHAT'S THAT--AT THE JEWELRY STORE YOU SAY
AND AFTER LARCH HAD KILLED HER SEEING THE MONEY HE PICKED UP A HANDFUL AS HE NEEDED SOME CHANGE
WHAT DEVILISH THING DID THAT AND WITH A TREMBLING FINGER JACK YOUNG POINTED TO THE BODY OF THE DEAD DOG ON THE FLOOR OF THE DETECTIVE'S ROOM
SO AFTER MRS DARCY WAS DEAD HE HURRIED ABOUT THE STORE WITH NO ONE IN THE WET AND DESERTED STREET TO WATCH HIM AND STOPPING THE TIMEPIECES MOVED THE HANDS OF MANY OF THEM TO SUIT HIS FANCY
SO LARCH HAS SENT OR IS GOING TO SEND HIS WIFE A DIAMOND CROSS
OF COURSE PHUT WAS GONE
I MAY HAVE TO BE UP ALL NIGHT AND I WANT SOMETHING TO READ THAT WILL KEEP ME AWAKE AND THE COLONEL SLIPPED INTO HIS COAT POCKET THE GREEN VOLUME
I CAN'T TELL FOR A CERTAINTY UNTIL TO-MORROW PARDON ME DR WARREN FOR PRESUMING ON WHAT IS PARTICULARLY YOUR OWN GROUND BUT DID YOU LOOK TO SEE IF ANY OF THE CIGARETTES WERE LEFT IN HIS CELL I DIDN'T NOTICE
KEEP IT I BEG OF YOU
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN GOING TO PUT THEM AWAY WITH THE INDIAN WATCH AND THE DIAMOND CROSS BUT SHE HAD NO CHANCE
NO MADAM
WHO ELSE AND THE WATCH WAS IN ALI'S HAND SURE
NOW DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD UNTIL I SPEAK TO YOU
SPOTTY MORGAN'S VACATION IS OVER
WE GOT TO TALK TO ALL OF EM
BURGLAR TRIED TO BLOW UP THE SAFE AND GOT BLOWED UP HIMSELF HOLD-UP MAN SHOT THREE OF THE GIRLS BEHIND THE DIAMOND COUNTER AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF NAW
WE HAVE CERTAIN MATTERS SETTLED AT ANY RATE YES AND I'LL GET BACK TO THE HOMESTEAD AND WATCH KING OBSERVED JACK YOUNG WITH A LAUGH
ALL HIS EYES ENCOUNTERED THOUGH WAS THE WHITE-WASHED WALL OPPOSITE HIM--A BARE WHITE AND GLARING WALL THAT MADE HIS EYES BURN--A WALL THAT SEEMED TO SHUT OUT HOPE ITSELF--AS IF IT WERE NOT ENOUGH THAT IT HAD BEEN AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF PANDORA'S BOX
NO THE TRIAL WENT OFF FOR TWO WEEKS
SO YOU GOT BACK WITH SPOTTY DID YOU
NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU
YOU KNOW THE STOCK DON'T YOU AS WELL AS SHE DID HERSELF
THEN HE SAID TO SHAG
WHY HE'S NOT ONLY ONE OF THE HIGHEST-PRICED DETECTIVES IN THE COUNTRY BUT HE'S RETIRED I'VE READ AND I DOUBT IF HE'D TAKE A CASE HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOUR CASE JIMMIE BOY AND AMY SMILED
I COULDN'T STAND IT TO BE NEAR HER AND SEE HER GOING OUT--WITH HIM
I DIDN'T FOR AN INSTANT THINK YOU HAD A HAND IN IT UNTIL JUST NOW
WE CAN'T TALK HERE SAID THE DISPATCHER OF THE NOTE
NO IT COULDN'T BE WITH A MURDER CHARGE EXPOSTULATED DONOVAN
STICK TO HIM LIKE A LEECH AND THE DETECTIVE INDICATED A CHAIR TO HIS VISITOR
HIDDEN ELECTRIC WIRES AND THE COLONEL THOUGHT OF A CERTAIN DISCOVERY HE HAD MADE
I GUESS YOU'LL BE INTERESTED SAID MULLIGAN
NOW IT SEEMS AS IF HE WERE FOUND GUILTY FAR FROM IT
MR MASON HAD WHAT WAS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A SHOW PLACE WITH BLOODED HORSES AND CATTLE AND HE WAS QUITE A FINANCIAL FIGURE IN MONROE COUNTY OF WHICH COLCHESTER WAS THE COUNTY SEAT
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HERE ALL SUMMER I SHAN'T MIND IF I'M PROVED INNOCENT AT LAST I HOPE WE CAN MANAGE THAT ALL RIGHT THEN YOU DO BELIEVE IN ME COLONEL OF COURSE I DO
KILLED--STABBED
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT LARCH I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING YET LEAST OF ALL REGARDING LARCH
THEM'S PASTE COLONEL
I'LL BE THERE WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE TALK WHISPERED THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF
AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO GET AWAY
YOU CAN CUT A POLE IN THE WOODS SAID THE BOY
ALL RIGHT I'LL SHADOW HIM
AND HE WENT ON THE SAME TRAIN WITH AARON GRAFTON THOUGH UNKNOWN TO THE LATTER
YOU--YOU DON'T OF COURSE I DON'T
THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN EXPLAINED CARROLL
I WONDER IF HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS HE DIDN'T GO NEAR THE PLACE
AND THE PRISONERS BEYOND THE BARRED DOOR WERE TOO BUSY WITH THEIR EXERCISE TO LOOK AROUND
PLAYING UP DARCY'S STORY DALEY AND SOME OF THE OTHER REPORTERS SPECULATED ON WHETHER OR NOT A BURGLAR MIGHT HAVE ENTERED THE STORE LEAVING NO TRACE OF HIS UNCANNY SKILL AND IN HIS WANDERINGS ABOUT THE PLACE HAVE ENTERED DARCY'S ROOM
THEY BROUGHT SUCH PRESSURE TO BEAR ON HER THAT SHE GAVE IN AND MARRIED LARCH WHO WAS AND IS WEALTHY BUT WHOSE SOCIAL POSITION WAS BENEATH HERS
I'M LATE AS IT IS SO'M I THE POLICEMAN HIS HEAVY-SOLED SHOES CREAKING IMPORTANTLY CAME ALONG THE STREET HURRYING NOT IN THE LEAST
ANYTHING I CAN DO COLONEL ASKED BASSET
IN TWO THREE OR IN PERHAPS MORE OF THE DOPE STICKS AS MY FRIEND DONOVAN CALLS THEM HE SHOVED A FINE NEEDLE THE TIP OF WHICH WAS DIPPED IN SOME SWIFT SUBTLE INDIAN POISON THE SECRET OF WHICH THESE TWO ALONE PERHAPS KNEW
SPOTTY ADMITTED THAT THE ORNAMENT MIGHT BE THE VERY ONE WANTED BUT HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO TELL HOW HE HAD COME BY IT
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT I DON'T KNOW
IT WAS OF COURSE POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD IN HIS DRUNKEN STATE GONE TO THE STORE TO GET THE PAPER CUTTER WHICH SOME PECULIAR KINK OR TWIST IN HIS DRINK-INFLAMED BRAIN HAD CAUSED HIM TO REMEMBER AT AN ODD TIME
DOES ANYBODY IN TOWN KNOW YOU'RE HERE WELL MY PICTURE YES IT IS PROBABLY DOWN AT HEADQUARTERS
YOU'VE BEEN DEVILISHLY LUCKY AND GOTTEN THROUGH MORE NARROW PLACES THAN I'D EVER GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR
I'M DONE WITH SOFT WORDS AND FOOLISHNESS HE TOOK A SUDDEN STEP NEARER HER AND SHE SHRANK BACK
SPOTTY WANTED ME TO TELL YOU HE'D CONFESSED AND HE'S DEAD SORE ON BLUE IKE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS THE COLONEL SAID NOTHING AND THEN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS A DOG MIGHT ON EMERGING FROM DEEP WATER AND REMARKED
LOOK GAD
I HATE THE WORD
BUT I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
I CONSIDER THAT YOU SAVED MY LIFE
COLONEL ASHLEY--OR COLONEL BRENTNALL AS HE HAD REGISTERED AT THE HOTEL--HAVING BY MEANS OF A MORE OR LESS ADROIT BIT OF CAMOUFLAGE OBTAINED POSSESSION OF THE NEWSPAPER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE MURDER OF MRS DARCY AND OF THE HOLDING OF HER COUSIN AND HARRY KING ON SUSPICION TOSSED THE JOURNAL ON THE BED BESIDE HIS WELL-WORN COPY OF THE COMPLETE ANGLER THEN TO DEMONSTRATE HIS COMPLETE MASTERY OVER HIMSELF HE PICKED UP THE BOOK NEVER SO MUCH AS GLANCING AT THE BLACK HEADLINES AND READ
WE GOT BACK SOME OF THE STUFF FOR THE OLD LADY
THE REPORTERS'LL BE HERE SOON ENOUGH HE ADDED WITH A WINK AT DARCY
PLACE ON FIRE
THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING
HE WAS WELL OFF WHEN HE MARRIED
THEY HAD ALL STOPPED
BE BACK IN A MINUTE BUT IT WAS IN LESS TIME THAN THAT THAT HE CAME RETURNING ON THE RUN AND HIS FACE SHOWED EXCITEMENT
OH YES WENT ON THE DETECTIVE
HOWEVER THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH AS A CUFF BUTTON MISSING AS FAR AS COULD BE LEARNED AFTER THE CONTENTS OF THE STORE HAD BEEN CHECKED UP THOUGH OF COURSE AN INTRUDER MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED OFF BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN ANYTHING
TAIN'T DAT AT ALL WELL WHAT IS IT
YOU KNOW THEY TAKE A LOT OF LITTLE DIAMONDS NOW SET EM IN A CLUSTER AND MAKE EM LOOK AS GOOD AS A SOLITAIRE
AND AS NOTHING HAD YET BEEN MADE PUBLIC TO THE EFFECT THAT THE WATCH WHICH HAD HAD A PART IN BOTH CASES WAS MORE THAN AN ORDINARY TIMEPIECE MR BLAND DID NOT CONNECT IT WITH THESE TWO DEATHS
LOOK HERE HARRY MY BOY
NOW LET'S SEE HOW MY RODS ARE
WELL MR GRAFTON IN SPITE OF THE WELL KNOWN REPUTATION YOU BEAR I THINK YOU WILL STAND A LITTLE WATCHING
THAT'S THE IDEA HARRY BUT I BROUGHT THAT KNIFE TO DARCY TO HAVE HIM ENGRAVE IT THAT MAY BE
THE COLONEL TOLD ME SOME OF IT DID HE
AND SAY
YES A CLOCK STRUCK
BASSET TOYED IDLY WITH THE JEWELED CROSS WHICH SPARKLED AS BRAVELY AS THE REAL STONES MIGHT HAVE DONE
THAT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CONSENTED TO MEET YOU EXCEPT THAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE THEM ONLY TO ME PERSONALLY
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED--A BIG NEW YORK DETECTIVE BUT WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT ASKED THE COLONEL
THE COLONEL AND SHAG TURNED THEIR EYES ON HIM
I'D LIKE TO FIND IT I'LL HAVE THE CELL SWEPT FOR YOU PROMISED THE WARDEN AS HIS DEPUTY WENT OFF TO LOOK FOR A RAT
GOING YET TOO
WELL I'LL GET ON MY WAY SAID JACK AFTER A PAUSE
I WAS WONDERING HOW WE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT IF WE ACCEPTED THE SHOCK THEORY
AND THEN AS HE CHANCED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION CAME INTO HIS FACE
IT'S WORTH ABOUT TEN DOLLARS I GUESS AND SAY IF EVER THERE WAS A SORE CROOK IT'S SPOTTY
HE'LL BE HERE PRETTY SOON I GUESS
I MUST GET THE POLICE JAMES DARCY STARTED TO CROSS THE ROOM TO REACH AND FLING OPEN THE FRONT DOOR LEADING TO THE STREET THAT HE MIGHT CALL THE ALARM TO OTHERS THAN THE DEAF COOK WHO HAD NOT YET COME DOWNSTAIRS
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU
THE COLONEL PAUSED AT THE INSTRUMENT RECALLING THAT AS HE HAD BEEN ABOUT TO USE IT BEFORE THERE HAD COME IN A CALL FOR HIM--THE CALL ANNOUNCING THE DEPARTMENT-STORE KEEPER
I SHALL KEEP THEM IN STRICT CONFIDENCE HOWEVER NOW THAT I AM FAIRLY WELL ASSURED THERE IS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE IN YOUR VISIT TO ME
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
WHAT'S THE DOPE DON'T KNOW YET ANSWERED CARROLL
TO SEND WORD TO YOU THAT HE'D COME ON AND STAND TRIAL BUT STARS AND STRIPES
FO TH LOVE OF HONEY CAKES DON'T GASPED SHAG GRABBING HIM JUST IN TIME
HEAR IT TICK AND DONOVAN HELD OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS CLOSET
BUT BE FOXY ABOUT IT JACK I WILL
I SHOULD SAY SO CRIED THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF AS HE MADE A GRAB FOR THE TELEPHONE TO DICTATE A MESSAGE TELLING THE POLICE OF SANGO THE WESTERN CITY TO HOLD SPOTTY MORGAN UNTIL HE COULD COME FOR HIM
BUT CONSIDER
YOU SAW THE BODY CARRIED OUT--OR ARE YOU STILL SO DRUNK YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
AMEN ECHOED THE COLONEL
I COULDN'T WAIT
AND THE WAY YOU ARE TO FISH FOR PERCH WITH A SMALL FROG AH-A-A-A IT WAS A LONG-DRAWN EXCLAMATION OF ANTICIPATORY DELIGHT AND INTO THE EYES OF THE MILITARY-LOOKING TRAVELER THERE APPEARED A SOFT AND GENTLE LIGHT AS THOUGH IN FANCY HE COULD LOOK OFF ACROSS SUNLIT MEADOWS TO A STREAM SPARKLING BENEATH A BLUE SKY WHITE-STUDDED WITH FLEECY CLOUDS WHERE THERE WAS A SOFT CARPET OF GREEN GRASS SHADED BY A NOBLE OAK UNDER WHICH HE MIGHT LOUNGE AND LISTEN TO THE WIND RUSTLING THE NEWLY-BORN LEAVES
THERE'S A MAN HEADED FOR MY OFFICES AND I MUST GET IN AHEAD OF HIM
AND ITS THE SAME ONE SHERE ALI HAD IN HIS HAND WHEN HE WAS FOUND DEAD YES BUT BOTH OF THEM HAD THEIR HEADS SMASHED IN YES JACK BUT GREAT SCOTT COLONEL
YES--WHAT IS IT
HER HANDS SEEMED TO WAVER
AND THE GRAY-HAIRED WOMAN WHOSE PRIDE IT HAD BEEN TO DISPLAY HER BEAUTIFUL WARES TO HER FRIENDS AND OTHERS WAS ALL ALONE IN A GRAVE FAR UP ON THE HILL--A HILL WHICH LOOKED DOWN ON COLCHESTER--WHICH LOOKED DOWN ON THE VERY STORE ITSELF
NO IT WAS BEFORE MY TIME
BUT IF I HAVE TO TELL HER YOU LOOKED AS THOUGH YOU HAD LOST EVERY LAST FRIEND YOU HAD IN THE WORLD IT'S ALL RIGHT COLONEL
THEN HE SAID
ALL THE CLOCKS HAVE STOPPED
IT DIDN'T HURT HIM MUCH OBSERVED THE COLONEL AND IF I HAVE GUESSED RIGHT HIS DEATH WILL BE PAINLESS HOW SOON ASKED DONOVAN
THAT'S UNUSUAL--FOR HIM
HE WAS JUST STARTING IN THE STORE WAS CLOSED HE SAID BUT HE ADDED A BIT OF TESTIMONY THAT CAUSED COLONEL ASHLEY AND OTHERS TO THINK A BIT
AT TIMES LARCH STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE SMILING GOOD-NATUREDLY BUT WITH RATHER A CYNICAL LOOK ON HIS CLEAN-CHISELED BUT CRUEL FACE
SO THE OLD LADY'S DEAD IS SHE
HE IS SUSPECTED
HOWEVER THOUGH CARROLL THINKS HE CAN PROVE THEY WERE ARRANGED DELIBERATELY TO SHOCK ANY ONE WHO AT THE PROPER MOMENT MIGHT TOUCH THE SHOWCASE YET I THINK WE CAN PROVE THAT AN ACCIDENTAL CROSSING OF PERFECTLY HARMLESS WIRES TO DARCY'S LATHE WITH THE CITY'S ELECTRIC LIGHT CIRCUIT MAY HAVE CAUSED THE TWO ACCIDENTS
THE BOLDER SPIRITS RATTLED THE KNOB OF THE LOCKED PORTALS AND TAPPED ON THE GLASS THAT WAS NOW MISTY AND GRIMY FROM HANDS AND NOSES PRESSED AGAINST IT
I NEEDED THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HELP COMPLETE MY LATHE MODEL AND--WELL WE HAD WORDS OVER THAT TOO THEN DO I UNDERSTAND SUMMED UP CARROLL THAT THE NIGHT MRS DARCY WAS KILLED YOU HAD A QUARREL WITH HER OVER MISS MASON AND ABOUT THE MONEY AND BECAUSE YOU SPENT TOO MUCH TIME WORKING ON YOUR PATENT LATHE WELL YES THOUGH I DON'T ADMIT I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME AND I SURELY WILL CLAIM SHE OWED ME THAT MONEY
SO HE SAYS ADDED JACK YOUNG SIGNIFICANTLY
IS CHET IN HERE COLONEL
I HAVE ENGAGED THE BEST DETECTIVE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR YOU AND SHE BECKONED TO THE LAWYER TO COME FORWARD
AND NOW THIS DRUNKEN FOOL HAS IT
HE'S BEEN WORRYING IT AS HE WOULD A BONE AND HE'S GOT IT IN HIS MOUTH AND CAN'T GET IT OUT
GREAT
NEVER MIND WHAT WE THINK SAID CARROLL
AS FOR LARCH HE MET THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS FIRED AT HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND OTHERS AT THE HOMESTEAD AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE
FIRST HAVING HAD HIMSELF ACCREDITED AS WORKING IN DARCY'S BEHALF BY BEING INTRODUCED BY THE ACCUSED MAN'S LAWYER THE DETECTIVE PAID A VISIT TO THE JEWELRY STORE
I MUST WATCH YOU A BIT CLOSER MY FRIEND THE COLONEL CONSIDERED THAT HE WAS WORKING TO CLEAR DARCY AND HE WANTED TO DO IT IN HIS OWN WAY
THIS SETTING HIM FREE ON BAIL HAS GIVEN ME A NEW ANGLE TO WORK ON
NOBODY KNOWS I'M IN TOWN EXCEPT MY MAN SHAG--AND YOU
HE'S GOT HOLD OF THE INDIAN'S WATCH CRIED THE DETECTIVE
NOR YOU EITHER HE WENT ON
THAT'S WHAT MADE SPOTTY SORE
GIVE THAT BOY A DOLLAR
I'M NOT AFTER YOU
COME ON OVER TO MY ROOM AND HAVE A TALK WITH HIM
TRADE HAD BEEN RATHER BRISK IN THE SHOP--POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF GRUESOME CURIOSITY--WHEN ONE AFTERNOON A MAN ENTERED WHO SEEMED TO KNOW SEVERAL IN THE PLACE
BE CAREFUL TO GET STRAIGHT ANY MESSAGES THAT COME IN OVER THE WIRE AND IF JACK YOUNG CALLS UP GET THE PHONE NUMBER OF THE PLACE WHERE HE IS SO I CAN CALL HIM YES SAH COLONEL AND SHAG YES SAH COLONEL HAND ME THAT LITTLE GREEN BOOK
I MAY HAVE TO WAS THE COLONEL'S ANSWER
KEEPING THE TOOL-HOUSE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE MAN NOW NERVOUSLY PACING THE PLATFORM THE COLONEL WALKED RAPIDLY AWAY FROM THE STATION IN THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE BOY
SO STICK TO HARRY JACK MY BOY HE WON'T REQUIRE MUCH STICKING TO AT PRESENT
IT WAS ALL DUE TO A MISUNDERSTANDING HE SAID
SOMEWHAT TO THE SURPRISE OF DONOVAN THE MILITARY DETECTIVE ACCEPTED THE TIMEPIECE ON HIS OPEN PALM AND SO GINGERLY THAT IT CAUSED DONOVAN TO REMARK
BUT THIS IS SUCH--SUCH A BIG THING--IT MEANS SO MUCH TO HIM--TO ME
COURSE I WENT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND THERE WAS THE DAGO--CROAKED WHAT DID IT ASKED DONOVAN
THE KIND THEY USE IS DESIGNED TO DISAPPEAR ALMOST AS SOON AS IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE
BUT WHAT AILED HIM DOC I CAN'T SAY YET
DID I TELL YOU TO SPEAK BUT SHAG ONLY LAUGHED
THEN SHAG AND I SLOWLY THE BOOK SLIPPED FROM HIS HAND
I WANTED MORE LIGHT ON A CERTAIN PIECE OF JEWELRY I HAD IN MY HAND AND I THOUGHTLESSLY THREW OVER A SWITCH I SAW ON DARCY'S TABLE
THEN THEY TALKED ABOUT MANY THINGS
FOR THE WILY FISHERMAN TO SLIP FROM THE CAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK AND GET BEHIND A TOOL SHANTY WAS THE WORK OF BUT A MOMENT AND AS THE TRAIN PULLED OUT AND PUFFED ON ITS WAY THE DETECTIVE PEERING AROUND THE CORNER OF THE SHED WHICH HOUSED A HANDCAR AND OTHER TOOLS OF THE SECTION HANDS HAD A GLIMPSE OF HIS FISH AS HE FACETIOUSLY TERMED HIM STANDING RATHER IRRESOLUTELY ON THE STATION PLATFORM
I'M DRUNK YET BUT I DON'T CARE
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE HERE UNTIL WE CAN LOOK AROUND MORE I'LL STAY FOR A WHILE SAID HALIDAY
I WONDER IF GRAFTON NO IT COULDN'T BE
WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE FIRST MAN AS HE SWUNG DOWN FROM HIS VEHICLE WITH A WIRE CARRIER FILLED WITH BOTTLES IN HIS HAND
I CAN'T SAY BUT IT OUGHT NOT BE VERY LONG
THE WIRES WILL KEEP
NOW WHAT IS IT THIS VERY EVIDENTLY WAS SOMETHING FOR COLONEL ASHLEY TO DISCOVER AND WITH ALL HIS SKILL HE SET HIMSELF TO THIS TASK
IT WAS THAT OF A HUNTER STANDING AS THOUGH HE HAD JUST DELIVERED A SHOT AND WAS PEERING TO SEE THE EFFECT
SOME ONE SENSED THE UNUSUAL
IT ISN'T OUR CASE SO WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT NO
THANK YOU RESPONDED THE DETECTIVE
HE AROSE HIS GREEN BOOK IN ONE HAND AND BOWED HIS APOLOGIES
YOU ARE TO KNOW THEN THAT THERE IS A NIGHT AS WELL AS A DAY FISHING FOR A TROUT AND THAT IN THE NIGHT THE BEST TROUT COME OUT OF THEIR HOLES AH HA MUSED THE COLONEL
I COULDN'T HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE WAY OF THAT TRUCK ANY MORE THAN I COULD HAVE FLOWN
HE NEVER FOR AN INSTANT REALLY BELIEVED YOU GUILTY JIMMIE BOY EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE ELECTRIC WIRES THOUGH HE LET THOSE TWO DETECTIVES THINK HE DID AND WHAT ABOUT SINGA PHUT AND HARRY KING OH THEY WERE ONLY INCIDENTS SO COLONEL ASHLEY SAYS WENT ON THE HAPPY GIRL AS THE AUTOMOBILE ROLLED ALONG
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT FOR I ASKED HIM THE BEST WAY TO REACH THIS PLACE
SOME DAGO HAD HIS HEAD BUSTED IN REMARKED THONG
BUT THAT IT DID KILL CHET I'M CERTAIN I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE COLONEL ASHLEY
I DON'T USUALLY WIND THE WATCHES THAT ARE LEFT FOR REPAIR UNLESS I'M REGULATING THEM AND I HAVEN'T ANY LIKE THAT IN NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE ON THE PART OF THE PROSECUTOR MEANS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU WHEW WHISTLED THE COLONEL
LOOK SAID THE COLONEL TO JACK YOUNG
QUITE A RACING MAN HE IS A GENTLEMAN AND A FINE JUDGE NOT ONLY OF WHISKY WHICH IS GOOD IN ITS PLACE BUT OF HORSES AND MEN TOO
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE VILLAGE WHEN YOU GET THE ANSWER TO THE NOTE
IS SHE--IS SHE DEAD HE GASPED
IT WAS SOME NIGHT--A WET NIGHT--BELIEVE ME--A WET NIGHT--AWFUL WET
IT WASN'T MUCH
THE HIDDEN WIRES XV
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT I AWAKENED WITH A SUDDEN START JUST BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK
HE OFTEN HAS PURCHASED DIAMONDS HERE THOUGH HE IS NOT MARRIED AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE IS ENGAGED--RATHER LATE IN LIFE TOO FOR HIM TO BE CONSIDERING THAT OH WELL YOU NEVER CAN TELL AND THE COLONEL SMILED
IT IS A POINT WORTH LOOKING INTO I AGREE WITH YOU
YOU SAVED MY LIFE JUST NOW I KNOW THAT
I'LL GET YOU ONE OFFERED RILEY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE COMING EXPERIMENT
BEING CONVENIENT TO THE COURTHOUSE NEARLY ALL THE JUDGES AND LAWYERS TOOK LUNCH THERE
I SHALL BE INTERESTED IN MAKING THE AUTOPSY YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND VERY LITTLE TRACE OF THE POISON SAID THE COLONEL
YOU KNOW COLONEL THESE THINGS ARE ABOUT ALIKE
BUT I MUST SAY IT LOOKS BLACK
NOR DID SHE I FANCY THOUGH SHE WAS WILLING TO TAKE ME AS I WAS
THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS
IT'S PAST TIME SALLIE WAS DOWN TO GET BREAKFAST
THE DOG'S GOING MAD CRIED JACK
THEY HAVE YET TO PROVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY CAN
BUT WHEN HIS PAL WENT BACK ON HIM WHAT DO YOU MEAN--HIS PAL WENT BACK ON HIM ASKED THE COLONEL AND THERE WAS UNEASINESS IN HIS VOICE
YOU GET MY IDEA I GUESS
IT BELONGED TO AN EAST INDIAN YOU SAID YES TO SINGA PHUT
THAT WAS ENOUGH
AS FOR COLONEL ASHLEY AFTER HE HAD REVIVED AMY FROM HER FAINT AT THE STREAM HE HAD TOLD SHAG TO TAKE APART THE FISHING ROD
OF COURSE THIS WAS POSSIBLE AND IT ADDED TO THE INFERENCE OF SOME THAT A BURGLAR USED TO SUCH WORK HAD ENTERED THE PLACE AND BEING DETECTED AT WORK BY MRS DARCY HAD KILLED HER
I'LL WIRE FOR KEDGE
STILL YOU MAY DISCOVER SOMETHING BUT DOCTOR WARREN DID NOT
I WENT OUT THE SIDE ONE
SHE WANTED TO APPLY FOR A DIVORCE BUT WHEN I SHOWED HER THAT THIS WOULD BRING ABOUT MUCH PUBLICITY AND NECESSITATE TAKING TESTIMONY ON BOTH SIDES WITH POSSIBLY A LONG-DRAGGED OUT CASE SHE AGREED MERELY TO ASK FOR A SEPARATION NOW ON THE ACCUSATION OF CRUEL AND INHUMAN TREATMENT
I'LL GET KEDGE HE STARTED FOR THE TELEPHONE TO DICTATE A TELEGRAM
BEEN OUT AL'NIGHT--YOU KNOW HOW TISH
THEN A RATTLING MILK WAGON SWUNG AROUND THE CORNER
HE'S BEEN CUTTING A PRETTY WIDE SWATH SINCE HE GOT OUT ON BAIL AND HE'S BEEN HAVING SOME PRETTY SPORTY TIMES AND YOU'VE BEEN WITH HIM
HE SAVED HIS LIFE ALL RIGHT RECOVERING HIS BREATH AND THE CONTROL OF HIS NERVES AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE DETECTIVE HIS VOICE TREMBLING IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TURNED TO THE MAN WHO HAD DRAGGED HIM FROM ALMOST UNDER THE BIG WHEELS AND SAID
MISS MASON ADMIRED IT AND I PLANNED TO BUY IT
FOR WHAT STARTED OUT TO BE A SIMPLE MURDER CASE MUSED THE OLD DETECTIVE AS HE WENT BACK TO HIS HOTEL THAT NIGHT THIS ONE BIDS FAIR TO BECOME QUITE COMPLICATED AN IMPULSE--IT WAS HARDLY MORE THAN THAT AND YET IT HAD TO DO WITH THE MATTER IN HAND--SENT THE DETECTIVE TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS
SHE HAD SOME MEANS OF HER OWN SHE DECLARED AND WOULD WORK RATHER THAN ACCEPT A CENT FROM HIM
I TOOK THAT OUT FIRST
AS I SAID THE FACTS OF THE SEPARATION OF THE LARCHS WILL SOON BE HERALDED ALL OVER THE CITY FOR THE FINAL PAPERS WERE FILED TO-DAY AND THE REPORTERS WILL BE SURE TO SEE THEM
I HEARD THERE WAS ANOTHER ACCIDENT UP HERE HE WENT ON STILL SMILING SO I CAME TO HAVE A LOOK
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DECENT FOR A WHILE AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE--WHICH MARRIAGE WAS A MISTAKE FROM THE FIRST--I CAN SEE THAT NOW
IT'S A BOOK BOUT ANGLE WORMS AS NEAH AS I KIN MAKE OUT YOU MEAN IZAAK WALTON'S COMPLETE ANGLER I GUESS SAID A MAN WHO PASSED BY JUST THEN ON HIS WAY TO THE SMOKING COMPARTMENT AND HE SMILED GENIALLY AT SHAG
WHY LARCH HAD GONE ON THIS BOND DID NOT MAKE ITSELF CLEAR TO COLONEL ASHLEY AND HE SET THAT DOWN IN HIS LITTLE RED NOTE BOOK AS ONE OF THE MATTERS NEEDING TO BE CLEARED UP
HE'S DEAD ALL RIGHT I THOUGHT MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER PRISONERS MIGHT HAVE GOT IN AND CROAKED HIM COMMENTED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE
I ALMOST WISH YOU HADN'T SAVED ME
POSITIVELY MY LAST CASE AND ONCE MORE HE BANGED HIS HAND DOWN ON THE TABLE
AND HIS MANNER WAS CERTAINLY NERVOUS
HIT WITH SOMETHING
THERE HE IS THE GIRL RUSHED IMPULSIVELY FORWARD AND AS SHE HELD OUT HER HANDS IN A VOICELESS APPEAL THERE WAS WORRY AND ANGUISH DEPICTED ON HER FACE
THE COLONEL HAD ADOPTED A SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE DISGUISE
I SAY SHAG HE WENT ON RAISING HIS VOICE FROM A MURMURED WHISPER TO A LOUDER COMMAND
IT'S DALEY FROM THE TIMES REPORTED MULLIGAN PEERING OUT
THERE CAME ANOTHER KNOCK ON THE SIDE DOOR DOWNSTAIRS
THE COLONEL GUY THE DOCTOR'S VOICE SHOWED HIS PUZZLEMENT
DAT'S DE WUSTEST EVER AND HE DOUBLED UP WITH SILENT MIRTH
BUT IT ANGERED ME I ADMIT
I'M GOING TO POMPEY OUT WHERE YOU SAID MRS LARCH IS STAYING YES ONLY SHE DOESN'T CALL HERSELF THAT NOW I UNDERSTAND SHE'S TAKEN HER MAIDEN NAME AGAIN SINCE THE SEPARATION
I NEVER EXPECTED TO DO ANY SHADOWING AGAIN
AND BY THE SAME TOKEN OF WONDERING I THINK I'D BETTER NOT LET YOU GET TOO FAR AWAY FROM ME MR GRAFTON
WELL I'VE GOT TO TAKE ANOTHER TACK I GUESS
NOW I'M IN IT THERE'S NO TROUBLE THAT'S TOO MUCH
BUT OF COURSE SHE MAY HAVE SOLD THEM
I DIDN'T NOTICE IT BEFORE THOUGH I DID HEAR THE WATCH IN HER HAND TICKING--I THOUGHT IT WAS HER HEART BEATING--I GUESS I SAID THAT BEFORE--I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING
NOW DON'T TALK TOO MUCH
WE WILL HAVE MR DARCY DESIGN SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR YOU THAT'S WHAT I WANT THE CUSTOMER WOULD SAY--"SOMETHING DIFFERENT--SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE EVERYWHERE AND SO THE DARCY TRADE HAD GROWN AND PROSPERED
THE HOMESTEAD WAS HONEYCOMBED WITH PRIVATE ROOMS BOOTHS AND TELEPHONES
THERE'S A NEEDLE IN THIS DOPE STICK AND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE DON'T TOUCH IT CRIED THE COLONEL
SO YOU DON'T DARE TELL YOUR FRIEND THE DIAMOND CROSS IS GONE OH YES SHE KNOWS IT THEN WHY THE WORRY EXCEPT ABOUT GETTING IT BACK WELL THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS
IS IT POSSIBLE HE DIDN'T MENTION FISHING NAW
THE TRUTH IS I'LL NOT NEED YOUR SERVICES IN HELPING ME TO RECOVER THE DIAMOND CROSS FOR MRS LARCH--OR MISS RATCHFORD AS SHE CALLS HERSELF SINCE THE SEPARATION
DID YOU BRING MY DIAMONDS AS YOU PROMISED YES I HAVE THEM HIS VOICE WAS AS COLD AS HERS
YOU CAN'T GET OUT BEFORE A TRIAL OR BEFORE I CAN PRODUCE SOME ONE ON WHOM I CAN ACTUALLY FASTEN THE MURDER
I'VE GOT TO GET THAT FIXED
THE FOLLOWING WAS WELL DONE AND A LITTLE LATER THE TWO MACHINES DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE BIG OFFICE BUILDING IN WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY HAD HIS HEADQUARTERS
BUT I MUST HAVE A TALK WITH HIS FRIEND CYNTHIA
A STEADY PERSISTENT DRIZZLE WHICH A HALF-HEARTED WIND BLEW THIS WAY AND THAT AS THOUGH NEITHER ELEMENT CARED MUCH FOR THE TASK IN HAND--THAT OF THOROUGHLY SOAKING THE PARTICULAR PART OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF COLCHESTER AND TAKING ITS OWN TIME IN WHICH TO DO IT
THEN GIVE THEM TO ME AND LET ME GO
SHE WAS WITH KENNETH
BUT YOU STAY RIGHT HERE YES SAH COLONEL
KING'S GOT CASH IF IT CAN ONLY BE GOTTEN AT
HE GAVE A QUICK BACKWARD GLANCE AND STARTED AS HE SAW ANOTHER FIGURE NOT FAR BEHIND HIM
AH COME IN HE CALLED AS A DISCREET KNOCK SOUNDED ON THE HALF-OPENED DOOR
THEN THE YOUNGER DETECTIVE GLANCED AT SHAG WINKED AN EYE AND MURMURED
THE POISON ON THE POINT THEN CAUSED DEATH AND VERY SPEEDY DEATH ADDED THE COLONEL
MAYBE HE NEVER READ WALTON AND THAT'S WHY HE'S SO IGNORANT COLONEL ASHLEY SETTLED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND WITH UNFURROWED BROW READ ON
CERTAINLY AGREED MR KETTRIDGE WHEN THE COLONEL TOLD WHAT HE WANTED
SOME HAD BEEN SMOKED DOWN TO A MERE STUB
BUT REMEMBER THIS SPOTTY
AND HE COULD HEAR VOICES WHICH WERE RAISED LOUDER THAN ORDINARY
DID IT MEAN THEIR LAWYER WAS COMING TO BID THEM CHEER UP OR TO TELL THEM IT LOOKED BLACK FOR THEIR CHANCES
YES SAH HUMPH
AND NOW NOW HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
BUT AS I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A SWORD CANE OR A SPRING DAGGER--THAT ONLY PRESSURE ON A CERTAIN PART WAS NEEDED TO FORCE OUT THE NEEDLE WITH ITS DEATH-CARRYING SMEAR OF SOME SUBTLE INDIAN POISON
I WONDER IF SHE REALLY BELIEVES HE'LL KEEP HIS WORD--OR CAN KEEP IT
THE DETECTIVE HELD IT OUT AND THE RED SPOTS ON IT SEEMED TO SHOW BRIGHTER IN THE GLEAM OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS
WHAT DO I THINK
HELLO JACK
IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO A COLLECTOR
YOU HELPED ME OUT WONDERFULLY ON THAT ROBBERY OF THE CHATHAM BANK WHEN THE CASHIER RAN SOME WIRES TO THE TIME LOCK AND HAD IT OPEN FIVE HOURS AHEAD OF TIME I WISH YOU'D COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE WIRES WITH ME
HE DOES WANT TO SEE ME EXCITEDLY THOUGHT THE COLONEL
IT WAS ONE EVENING WHILE SITTING IN HIS ROOM AT THE HOTEL IDLY TURNING OVER THE PAGES HARDLY ABLE TO CONCENTRATE HIS MIND ON WHAT HE READ FOR MUCH THINKING OF THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY THAT HIS EYE CHANCED ON PAGE 170 WHERE HE SAW THE PASSAGE
WILL YOU WALK A LITTLE WAY WITH ME HIS TONES HAD THE CUTTING COLDNESS OF STEEL AND THERE WAS A SORT OF RESTRAINED CRUELTY IN HIS EVERY ACTION
ALL RIGHT I'LL WAIT HERE FOR YOU
YOU MIGHT LET A DISCREET REPORTER KNOW ABOUT MISS MASON'S GOING TO THE JAIL I WILL COLONEL AND THANKS FOR THE TIP BUT JAMES DARCY DID NOT GO TO TRIAL THE NEXT DAY
SAY THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE SINCE I WAS A KID
WELL THAT LET'S ME OUT EVEN IF HE DID SAVE MY LIFE
NO ONE KNOWS MUCH ABOUT ALI FOR HE CAME HERE JUST RECENTLY
THE PLACE WAS ALSO THE SCENE OF MORE OR LESS IMPORTANT POLITICAL DINNERS OF THE STATE AT WHICH MATTERS IN NO SLIGHT DEGREE AFFECTING NATIONAL POLICIES WERE OFTEN WHIPPED INTO SHAPE
THE SOLUTION OF THE MURDER MYSTERY DEPENDED ON THE ANSWERS TO TWO QUESTIONS THE REPORTER POINTED OUT
I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS WORTH BUT I BELIEVE A SMALL FORTUNE AND WAS IT STOLEN FROM YOU NO
I'VE GOT TO GO OUT AND SEE IF I CAN'T GET IT MENDED
HE IS
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THE COLONEL SAT BEFORE THE GLASSES IN WHICH THE CRACKED ICE WAS RAPIDLY MELTING
CAN YOU IN ANY WAY ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THE CLOCKS IN THE STORE--CLOCKS THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT ORDINARILY GO FOR MANY DAYS--STOPPED AT DIFFERENT HOURS THE NIGHT OF THE KILLING
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED THEY ARE GOING TO PUT ME ON TRIAL TO-MORROW FOR THE MURDER OF MRS DARCY
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER
IS THAT YOUR DAGGER SNAPPED CARROLL AT THE JEWELRY WORKER
POISONED NEEDLE COLONEL ASKED DR WARREN AS HE SHOVED THE CIGARETTE DONOVAN HAD BROKEN TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
HOWEVER NOW THAT IT'S ALL OVER I CAN GIVE PROPER ATTENTION TO MY FISHING AND I MURMURED JAMES DARCY CAN BUT A SOFT HAND OVER HIS LIPS PREVENTED FURTHER UTTERANCE
WHEN LARCH WENT INTO MRS DARCY'S STORE SHE HAD THE TRAY OF RARE COINS OUT OF THE SAFE
SO LARCH IS GOING TO VISIT HIS WIFE YES
GO TO IT IF YOU LIKE
THAT'S WHAT DID IT EXCLAIMED THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN
WAKE UP
WE HAD THE PLACE ALL PICKED OUT WHERE IT WOULD STAND
I'M GOING INTO THE HOTEL TO TELEPHONE YES SAH COLONEL GETTING KENNETH ON THE WIRE THE DETECTIVE ASCERTAINED THAT THE MESSAGE FROM DARCY WAS CORRECT--THE TRIAL WAS TO GO ON UNEXPECTEDLY
HIS MANNER WAS DEJECTED
THE ODD COIN XIII
HE SURELY HAS TANGLED IT WORSE THAN EVER
THAT IS NOT SO HOWEVER
DONOVAN SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR
I'LL GET RIGHT AFTER HIM
WHY BETTER WOMEN THAN YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO COME BACK TO ME
I WAS GOING TO THE JAIL ON ANOTHER MATTER ANYHOW AND I MIGHT AS WELL KILL TWO BIRDS AS ONE
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND BEGAN THE COLONEL WHY YOU CAME TO ME OR HOW I TOLD HER IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO BROKE IN THE NEWSBOY
THIS IS IMPORTANT
FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO WORK ON THE MURDER CASE
WHERE IS HE NOW OH DAD CARRIED HIM OFF FOR SOME LONG-DELAYED FISHING ANSWERED AMY AS SHE AND JAMES DARCY LEFT THE COURTROOM BEFORE A THRONG THAT COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM CHEERING DESPITE THE CRIES OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE CONSTABLE
HOWEVER I MUST TAKE CARE THAT HE DOES NOT SEE ME SLIPPING BEHIND A TREE THE COLONEL EFFECTED A CHANGE IN HATS FOR HE ALWAYS WORE A SOFT ONE AND CARRIED SEVERAL COLLAPSIBLE ONES
AND NOW CARRYING OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE THE COLONEL ONE BRIGHT MAY MORNING PUT THE ODD TIMEPIECE IN HIS POCKET AND STARTED FOR THE DARCY JEWELRY STORE INTENDING TO HAVE KETTRIDGE LOOK AT THE MECHANISM AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WATCH
SHE TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS TO THE EXTENT OF BEING IN THE STORE ALMOST EVERY DAY AS HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN BEFORE HER TO ADVISE AND BE AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTATION WHETHER IT WAS THE BUYING OF A GOLD TEETHING RING FOR THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AN ENGAGEMENT RING FOR THE LATEST DEBUTANTE A WATCH FOR SON ATTAINING HIS MAJORITY OR PERHAPS NEW GOLD GLASSES FOR GRANDPAPA OR GRANDMAMA
JAMES DARCY RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH TO CLEAR THEM FROM THE FOG
I HAD ASKED MRS DARCY TO SET THAT STATUE ASIDE FOR ME
THERE'S NOBODY IN THE WIDE WORLD WHO CAN BRING PEACE AND QUIET TO AN ANGRY MIND LIKE MY FRIEND IZAAK WALTON IS THERE SHAG NO SAH COLONEL THEY ISN'T
NOT A MARK
OH DONOVAN HE CALLED AS HE SAW A FELLOW SLEUTH PASSING THROUGH AN OUTER ROOM
HE MAY HAVE COME BY IT IN A WAY THAT IS EASILY EXPLAINED AND IF WE INFERENTIALLY ACCUSED HIM THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE I SUPPOSE SO
BUT IT WAS A CLOSE CALL CHAPTER XX IN THE SHADOWS COLONEL ASHLEY AFTER A NIGHT'S SLEEP WAS ABOUT TO PREPARE FOR THE TRIP WHEN HE THOUGHT OF DARCY IN JAIL
IS THAT YOU CALLED THE COLONEL AS HE HEARD SOME ONE MOVING OUT IN THE HALL NEAR HIS DOOR
MORE THAN ONCE HIS EYES SOUGHT THOSE OF HARRY KING AND THE LATTER NODDED AND SMILED
FOR THE SKULL WAS BADLY FRACTURED AND VITAL ORGANS HAD BEEN PIERCED BY THE DAGGER WHICH THE PAPERS CALLED IT THOUGH IT REALLY WAS A PAPER CUTTER OF FOREIGN MAKE
HE CAN'T GET AWAY
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME I WILL
YOU'VE TOLD ME ALL I CARED TO KNOW
COME NOW--BRACE UP AND TELL US ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT IT OH I--I CAN BRACE UP ALL RIGHT
SPOTTY LOOKED NARROWLY AND SHREWDLY AT THE DETECTIVE
IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE CITY AND YES I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT
TAKE HER HOME NICE PRESHENT
IN THAT CASE THE COLONEL SHOOK HIS HEAD
I'M GOING TO KNOW NOT FROM ME COLONEL
NO TROUBLE ON THE TRIP
THE WATCH DON'T FIGURE IN THE CASE EXCEPT MAYBE THEY QUARRELED OVER WHO OWNED IT COLONEL ASHLEY SAID NOTHING
I'LL GET ABOUT THE SAME FUN OUT OF THIS AS I WOULD IF I FISHED--AND I'LL FISH WITH GREATER ENJOYMENT LATER ON--WHEN I'VE CLEARED YOU I HOPE YOU DO COLONEL
YES IT WAS AS NEAR TO HORSEBACK RIDING AS HE COULD COME SAID THE GIRL AND SHE SMILED THOUGH THE GRIEF DID NOT LEAVE HER BLUE EYES
WE FOUND YOU HAD GONE FISHING AND WE FOLLOWED YOU HERE
THOUGH IT HAD A GRILL IN WHICH NIGHTLY THERE GATHERED SUCH OF THE SPORTS OF COLCHESTER AS CARED FOR THAT FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT THE HOMESTEAD ALSO CATERED TO GATHERINGS OF A MORE REFINED NATURE
THE FISHING RODS SHAG CARRIED HE MUST HAVE MANAGED TO TRANSPORT SAFELY TO THE HOTEL THE COLONEL WAS TO OCCUPY FOR A TWO WEEKS VACATION AND REST FOR THE MILITARY DETECTIVE WAS SMILING AND GOOD-NATURED WHEN HE TOOK THEM FROM THEIR CASES AND GENTLY PLACED THEM ON THE BED
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A PHILOSOPHER JACK I'M NOT
AS FOR MONEY I'VE GOT MORE THAN I NEED AND AMY'S GOT A LITTLE NEST-EGG OF HER OWN
I WISH I KNEW WHAT TO MAKE OF GRAFTON MUSED THE COLONEL HIS SHARE IN IT--IF SHARE HE HAD--IS GETTING MORE COMPLICATED
WHERE IS SHE WHISPERED CASEY AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE SIDE OF HIS BUSINESS RIVAL TREMLAIN
YOU SAY HE AND LARCH HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT A PACKET OF DIAMONDS YES
NO I GUESS THAT'S ALL SHAG
BUT DON'T JUMP AT CONCLUSIONS
I STARTED OUT FOR SOME QUIET FISHING WHICH I VERY MUCH NEEDED FOR I AM GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS SORT OF THING
I CAN'T SAY
I AM PREPARED TO PAY WELL FOR ANYTHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME--AND HIM
ISN'T HE A TRUMP
BUT I CAN REMEMBER IT THEN AS THOUGH READING FROM THE LITTLE GREEN BOOK HE RECITED
SPOTTY V
HE PROBABLY PROMISED SINGA PHUT TO HAVE THE WATCH READY FOR HIM AND THEN EITHER IN WORKING ON HIS PET INVENTION THE ELECTRIC LATHE OR BECAUSE OF HIS QUARREL WITH HIS COUSIN FORGOT ABOUT THE EAST INDIAN'S WATCH
HERE HE GOES AND HAS A QUARREL WITH THE OLD LADY JUST BEFORE HE GOES TO BED
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT EJACULATED THE DEPUTY
THE COLONEL SPIED MULLIGAN THE OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST OFFICIAL ON THE SCENE AT THE MURDER OF MRS DARCY AND NODDED IN FRIENDLY FASHION
BUT THE FIRST ONE MUST HAVE WORKED
HERE COMES THE DOCTOR NOW
LOTS OF THEM WOULD BE GLAD TO PAY MORE
SHE'S KILLED YOU SAY I'M AFRAID SO ACCIDENT I DON'T KNOW
IT'S MRS LARCH WIFE OF LANGFORD LARCH THE WEALTHY HOTEL OWNER
SHE COULD HAVE HAD A REGULAR DIVORCE AND BIG ALIMONY--THAT IS IF HE COULD HAVE PAID MAYBE THAT'S IT--HE COULDN'T
YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN HER OF WHOM YOU MAY BE PROUD
AH-A-A-A BEG PARDON SIR BUT I WHAT THE MILITARY-APPEARING MAN SAT UP WITH A JERK INTO SUDDEN STIFFNESS WHILE THE SOFT LIGHT DIED OUT OF HIS EYES
STILL THAT COULDN'T BE HELPED AND OH DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME COLONEL ASHLEY
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D GET AFTER ME SO SOON COLONEL I'M NOT AFTER YOU SPOTTY THE DETECTIVE SPOKE QUIETLY BUT THE EFFECT ON THE MAN SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM HIM IN ONE OF THE LESS CONSPICUOUS CAFES IN COLCHESTER HAD THE EFFECT OF A SHOUT
IT'S A NEW STUNT--ELECTRICALLY SHOCKING AN OLD LADY BEFORE YOU BANG HER OVER THE HEAD OR STAB HER BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE
WE GOT OLE DOC HARRISON STEWED TO THE GILLS--HONES WE DID--STEWED LIKE--LIKE PRUNES--APRICOTS
I'VE GOT TO HAVE MONEY
I'VE GOT TO HAVE MONEY
I'VE GOT TO HAVE MONEY
IT'S EITHER FISHIN OR DETECTIN WIF DE COLONEL DAT'S WHUT IT SUAH AM
HAVE YOU ANY CASES TO MOVE THIS MORNING MR PROSECUTOR ASKED THE COURT IN FORMAL TONES
BUT I'LL GO OVER EVERYTHING MORE CAREFULLY CHECKING UP THE BOOKS
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER--AREN'T YOU MR KENNETH INDEED A DETECTIVE CAN HELP US BEST AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME I THINK MR DARCY WAS THE LAWYER'S ANSWER
I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR DIAMONDS IF YOU'LL SIGN THIS PAPER SO I CAN GET OUT OF THE TANGLE I'M IN
THEN CAREFULLY COVERING THE MOUTHPIECE WITH HIS HAND HE ANNOUNCED
I HAVE OFTEN HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF AND I HAVE READ OF MORE THAN ONE OF YOUR CASES
THEN THE YOUNG MAN SLOWLY ANSWERED
I'LL CONFESS EVERYTHING BEFORE HIS DEATH WHICH FOLLOWED SOON AFTER HE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SWIRLING WATERS LANGFORD LARCH MADE A COMPLETE CONFESSION TELLING HOW HE HAD KILLED MRS DARCY
WHAT DOES HE SAY AND THE VOICE WAS EAGER
I'VE SENT FOR THE ELECTRICIAN TO COME AND RIP OUT EVERYTHING
THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY--THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
ONLY I HATE TO SEE YOU KID YOURSELF ALONG BELIEVING THIS GUY DIDN'T DO THE JOB
INTO THE SHADOWS THEY STROLLED STILL STIFF AND UNCOMPROMISING BOTH OF THEM
THE SAFE HASN'T BEEN OPENED AND THE BEST OF THE GOODS--ALL THE DIAMONDS AND OTHER STONES--ARE IN THAT
I MUST SEE THAT NOTE MURMURED COLONEL ASHLEY AS HE SAW ONE HANDED TO THE BOY
WELL WE'VE GOT TO GET THE POLICE SAID CASEY
BESIDES I'VE--WELL I GUESS I WON'T SAY WHAT CONCLUSION I'VE COME TO REGARDING HIM
I SUPPOSE THE CROSS WAS STOLEN FROM YOU WHILE IT WAS TEMPORARILY IN YOUR POSSESSION AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO LET YOUR FRIEND KNOW FOR FEAR SHE MAY SUSPECT YOU
BUT FINISH YOUR STORY WELL THERE ISN'T MUCH MORE TO TELL
THERE YOU ARE HE SAID
WHY OF COURSE I AM AND YET THE COLONEL HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF A BIT TO MAKE THAT SOUND NATURAL
BUT THE LAUGH WAS INSTANTLY HUSHED AT THE LOOK THAT FLASHED FROM HIS EYES TOWARD THOSE WHO HAD INDULGED IN THE MIRTH
DO YOU KNOW AARON GRAFTON ASKED THE COLONEL
THE OTHER CLOCKS AND THEY'VE ALL STOPPED AT DIFFERENT TIMES ADDED TREMLAIN
MATTERS THERE HAD NEARLY ASSUMED THEIR NORMAL ASPECT
YOU JUST LET ME DO THE THINKING HE ADVISED AS HE TURNED TO GO OUT
THIS IS THE HAND IN WHICH THE TICKING WATCH WAS FOUND WAS IT NOT I BELIEVE SO
I KNOW I'M RIGHT JACK
HE'S SPENT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE PLACE I SUPPOSE BUT IF HE GOT IT HERE GREAT SCOTT
AND I'M NOT ADMITTING EVEN YET THAT YOU DID HAVE
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO TOGGED UP LIKE A COLORED MAN TO FOOL THE OTHER BULLS
IT'S A BAD HABIT I'VE BEEN ACQUIRING LATELY OF THINKING ALOUD
GLAD TO SEE YOU WENT ON THE COLONEL AS THOUGH TALKING TO A HUMAN AND WITH MORE GYRATIONS OF THE TAIL WHICH CONSTITUTED CHET'S SIDE OF THE TALK WITH THE COLONEL THE LITTLE CREATURE SOUGHT A WARM SPOT NEAR THE GAS LOG STRETCHED OUT AND SIGHED LONG IN CONTENTMENT
WELL THE QUESTION I AM TRYING TO SOLVE IS WHY DID SHE SAY
OH COLONEL
ANY OF THE DOORS OR WINDOWS FORCED AND THE DETECTIVE FAIRLY SHOT THESE QUESTIONS AT DARCY I THINK NOT
SHE HAS JUST BEEN GRANTED ON MY APPLICATION BEFORE THE VICE CHANCELLOR A SEPARATION FROM HER HUSBAND BUT SHE REFUSED TO ACCEPT ALIMONY AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME WITH ALL LARCH'S WEALTH I CAN'T SEE WHY
HE AND LARCH ARE BOTH SO WELL PICKLED THAT THEY'LL EASILY KEEP UNTIL MORNING WELL WATCH THEM AFTER THAT
NOW HOW ABOUT LAST NIGHT--WAS THERE ANY ROW--ANY NOISE
ANYHOW I THOUGHT I'D BETTER LET YOU KNOW WHAT I'D HEARD JACK I'M GLAD YOU DID
NOW I WONDER HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF GRAFTON IS TELLING ME THE TRUTH
BESIDES DARCY CAN EARN HIS LIVING WHICH IS A HANGED SIGHT MORE THAN SOME OF THESE DANCING LIZARDS CAN DO IF THEY WERE PUT TO IT IT DEVELOPED THAT THE WORDS OVER AMY WHICH HAD OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE MURDER BETWEEN JAMES DARCY AND HIS COUSIN HAD TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLDLY PROSPECTS OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
LARCH'S JEALOUS DISPOSITION WAS INFLAMED AND THERE WAS A STORMY SCENE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO THIS TIME NO DOUBLE CROSSIN YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT
I GIVE IT TO YOU--HAVE GRAVE--PEARL'S NAME--WHERESH MY KNIFE YOU CAN HAVE IT PRETTY SOON PROMISED THONG
BUT HE CERTAINLY KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM WORRY
DARCY LOOKED AT HIS NEW FRIEND IN SOME SURPRISE
HE ADMITTED CALLING AT THE JEWELRY STORE SOMEWHERE AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING IF THE ENGRAVING ON THE PAPER CUTTER HAD BEEN FINISHED
BUT IF I ADD THE INDUCEMENT OF ALL THE TROUT FISHING YOU ARE STRONGLY TEMPTING ME MY DEAR YOUNG LADY
INCIDENTALLY LARCH'S CONFESSION CLEARED UP OTHER MATTERS AND SHIFTED CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES FROM VARIOUS PERSONS
WHERESH MY GOLD KNIFE DARCY
HE HAS A PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL BENARES CANDLESTICKS IN THE FORM OF HOODED COBRA SNAKES THAT I WANT TO GET
I GENERALLY OPENED THE STORE
I THOUGHT YOU KNOWING A LOT ABOUT CLOCK-WORKS MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION
IT WAS LATE THAT AFTERNOON WHEN THE PAPERS IN EXTRA EDITIONS ANNOUNCED THE INDICTMENT OF JAMES DARCY FOR THE MURDER OF HIS COUSIN
HOWEVER NOTHING MORE CAME OF THAT
AS HE DID SO LARCH LAUGHED WILDLY
I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID IT
I RATHER GUESS IT MAKES IT LOOK A BIT BAD FOR YOUR FRIEND COLONEL ASHLEY AND THERE WAS A SNEER IN THE WORDS
IT'S TRUE SHE'S DEAF BUT SHE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY SO TO SPEAK A LONG WHILE AND SHE KNOWS THE SHOP AND THE GOODS PRETTY WELL
WE DON'T KNOW WAS THE ANSWER
CAUSE IT'S SO QUIET IN HERE ANSWERED CASEY
IT FELL ON THE BED WITH A SOFT THUD AND A BREEZE FROM THE PARTLY OPENED WINDOW RUFFLED A PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER
IT KEEPS ME BUSY ENOUGH HERE WITHOUT THAT YES WENT ON THE COLONEL MUSINGLY
WHAT IS YOU DESIRE COLONEL I WANT PEACE AND QUIET SHAG
HE MAY NEVER GO TO TRIAL AND THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT AND AS YOU NEVER CAN COUNT ON LEGAL TANGLES ALL THE SENTIMENT YOU CAN WORK UP IN HIS FAVOR WILL BE SO MUCH GAINED
YOU HAVE TOLD SUCH A STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY THAT I CAN NOT DOUBT YOU
BUT NOT THE KIND OF CONFESSION THAT WOULD BE ANY USE TO US
I HAVEN'T--OH I SEE
I HAD GIVEN HER A SHOCK WITHOUT KNOWING IT THAT WAS QUEER MURMURED THE COLONEL
I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING--I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
WHERESH MY GOLD-MOUNTED PAPER CUTTER DARCY HARRY KING AND STEWED TO THE GILLS AGAIN MURMURED PETE DALEY
I'VE A FLASHLIGHT TO LET YOU READ WHAT YOU SIGN IN CASE IT GETS TOO DARK DO YOU MEAN A RECEIPT FOR THE DIAMONDS NOT EXACTLY CYNTHIA I MISS RATCHFORD IF YOU PLEASE SHE EXCLAIMED
MRS DARCY HAS HER ROOMS IN FRONT
I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HER MARRIED LIFE WAS NOT HAPPY
OH SHAG
OH SHAG
I THINK I SHALL HAVE TO DO A LITTLE NIGHT FISHING SO SAYING HAVING READ A LITTLE FARTHER IN HIS IZAAK WALTON HE WENT PEACEFULLY TO HIS BERTH AND AWOKE CALMER AND HIMSELF AGAIN
STEELE AUTHOR OF THE MANSION OF MYSTERY ETC
THEY DON'T MAKE THAT KIND IN THIS COUNTRY
I AWOKE ONCE IN THE NIGHT
WELL LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID CARROLL AFTER JAMES DARCY HAD GIVEN WHAT THE DETECTIVES CONSIDERED WAS FOR THE TIME A SUFFICIENT HISTORY OF HIMSELF AND HIS RELATIVE AND HAD HASTILY GONE OVER SUCH OF THE STOCK AS WAS KEPT OUTSIDE THE SAFE
SO I DIDN'T EVEN WIND IT
ER--MR GRAFTON AND AS THOUGH TO REFRESH HIS MEMORY THE COLONEL GLANCED AT THE CARD ON HIS DESK
SOME ONE OUT HERE TO SEE YOU ALL RIGHT--BE THERE IN A SECOND
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MIND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT
OTHERWISE WE'LL GET INTO A TANGLE I THINK WE'RE IN ONE NOW SAID YOUNG
WELL COLONEL I NEVER MIND SPOTTY
WELL THERE'S A MOTIVE ALL RIGHT THREE IF YOU LIKE
GO ON WELL THEN I WANT TO FIND A CERTAIN VALUABLE DIAMOND CROSS A DIAMOND CROSS YES
IT WAS EITHER THREE OR FOUR I CAN'T BE SURE WHICH DARCY REPLIED
HE REACHED FOR THE LITTLE GREEN BOOK
THOSE WIRES MAY BE MERELY PART OF HIS EQUIPMENT YES AND THEY MAY--WAIT A MINUTE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE MANAGER
THAT'S MOVING PICTURE STUFF--THEATER BUSINESS YOU KNOW
IT'S A WATCH TICKING ANSWERED DARCY
WE MUSTN'T TOUCH THE BODY--THAT'S THE LAW
IT'S GETTING ON MY NERVES
SHALL I LEAVE THE WATCH APART THIS WAY COLONEL YES I MAY NEED IT TO SHOW TO THE JURY
IT WAS A MAKESHIFT JOB TO BEGIN WITH AND SINCE DARCY COMPLICATED THE WIRES WITH SOME THAT HE HOPED TO RUN HIS ELECTRIC LATHE WITH THERE IS NO TELLING WHEN ONE MAY GET A SHOCK HOW DID IT HAPPEN ASKED THE COLONEL AS THE JEWELER LED THE WAY TO THAT PART OF THE STORE WHERE DARCY HAD THE REPAIR BENCH BEHIND THE WATCH SHOWCASE
ABOVE AROUND BELOW ON ALL SIDES SOAKING THROUGH AND THROUGH DRIZZLING IT SOAKING IT SPRINKLING IT HALF-HIDING IT IN FOG AND MIST THE RAIN ENVELOPED COLCHESTER--A SODDEN DAMP GARMENT
THERE'S A BOLT ON THE DOOR CARROLL SNAPPED
TOO LATE
SHE WAS SHOCKED WHILE LEANING AGAINST THE SILVERED METAL EDGE OF THE GLASS CASE AND ON EXAMINATION I FIND SOME HIDDEN ELECTRICAL WIRES THERE--WIRES THAT MUST IN SOME WAY HAVE BECOME CROSSED ON THE LIGHTING CIRCUIT
I CAN NOT COMPOUND A FELONY SO IF YOU HAVE IN MIND THE DISCLOSURE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD INCRIMINATE YOU INCRIMINATE ME YES OR INVOLVE YOU IN ANY WAY
OH COLONEL BRENTNALL
WHO BELONGS TO IT SINGA PHUT IS AN EAST INDIAN EXPLAINED DARCY
NO ONE LOOKED FROM THE STORES OR HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE OR ACROSS FROM THE JEWELRY SHOP
HE DAREN'T TELL I SUPPOSE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WIFE
WELL I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN SAID THE COLONEL
YOU WON'T KEEP THE STORE OPEN HE INQUIRED
TEARING IT OPEN THE DETECTIVE READ A MESSAGE FROM ONE OF HIS AGENTS IN A DISTANT WESTERN CITY
THE DIAMOND CROSS STILL KEPT ITS MYSTERY
AND YET IF THIS IS HERE HOW COULD HER HUSBAND SEND IT TO HER
NO TELLING WHAT THAT MAY DEVELOP
I HAVEN'T SOLD MUCH ON THIS TRIP BUT IF HE BUT HE DON'T WANT TO BOY
I'D LIKE TO LOOK ABOUT A BIT MYSELF
I TRIED TO MAKE HER A LITTLE HAPPIER BY TALKING TO HER
CHET WAS WORRYING THE TISSUE PAPER IN WHICH THE INDIAN'S WATCH WAS WRAPPED
ALL I KNOW IS I SLEPT QUITE SOUNDLY--SOUNDER THAN USUAL IN FACT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A CLOCK STRIKE THREE OR FOUR MURMURED THONG
HE MIGHT BUY HER A DIAMOND CROSS AS A SORT OF FORGIVENESS GIFT
I'D OUGHTER CLEARED OUT BUT I WAS WAITIN FOR A PAL AN--OH WELL IT WAS JUST LIKE YOU TO COME AROUND EARLY MAN DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
BUT WHAT'S YOUR HURRY
IT WAS ALMOST DESERTED NOW SAVE FOR A FEW CUSTOMERS AND THE CLERKS
HAVING DONE THAT I'M AT YOUR SERVICE IF I CAN HELP WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
WHAT'S THE MATTER COLONEL ASKED JACK
AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL--IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME--BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
THE ELECTRICIANS HAD BEEN TOLD TO REMOVE THEM BUT HAD NOT YET DONE SO BUT I THOUGHT THOSE WIRES WERE DEAD--CUT--AFTER THE OTHER ACCIDENT MR KETTRIDGE SO THEY WERE
I WANT TO KNOW AND BY GAD
DOC WARREN EH MUSED THONG TO HIS PARTNER AS DARCY PRECEDED THEM DOWNSTAIRS
HE SAW THE RED SPOT ON THE FLOOR--THE SPOT WHICH EVEN NOW IN SPITE OF MANY SCRUBBINGS WAS VISIBLE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO NOW THAT THE STORE WAS OPENED FOR BUSINESS AGAIN WALKED IN TO SELECT SOME PIECE OF GOLD OR SILVER SOME JEWEL FOR THEIR OWN ADORNMENT OR THAT OF ANOTHER
FIRST WHICH WOUND KILLED MRS DARCY
HE'S GOT A DATE WITH LARCH THE HOTEL KEEPER AND THERE MAY BE SOMETHING IN IT OH GO BY ALL MEANS
I AM NOT HERE PROFESSIONALLY THOUGH--IN FACT I'VE PRACTICALLY RETIRED--AND I WOULD MUCH PREFER BUT YOU WOULDN'T REFUSE TO HELP ANY ONE WHO NEEDED IT WOULD YOU
HIS HANDS IN NEW GLOVES SLOWLY CLASPED AND UNCLASPED AS THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TWINE THE FINGERS ABOUT THE SOFT THROAT OF A VICTIM
INQUIRY AT THE HOTEL DESK SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE INFORMATION AS TO THE LOCATION OF THE STORE AND THE DETECTIVE WAS SOON OUT IN THE WET STREETS BREATHING IN DEEP OF THE DAMP AIR--FOR IT WAS FRESH AND THAT WAS WHAT THE COLONEL LIKED
YES I'LL LET KEDGE FINISH THIS UP
THEN HE TELEPHONED FOR HALIDAY OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AND ALSO FOR THE CHIEF ELECTRICIAN OF THE POLICE SIGNAL SYSTEM AND ALL THREE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING AT THE WIRES AND TESTING THEM
COLONEL ASHLEY YES
MORE TROUBLE AT THE PLACE MUSED THE COLONEL QUICKENING HIS STEPS
BUT TROLLEY CARS AND AUTOS GOING PAST DROWNED ALL SOUNDS OF THE FIGHT
WELL I THINK HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE CIGARETTES--AND--HE FOUND IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED DR WARREN
AND IT WAS WHISPERED ABOUT
SPOTTY MORGAN HAS CONFESSED EVERYTHING AND AGREES TO EXTRADITION
IT WAS TAKEN CLOSE TO THE TIME SHE WAS KILLED COLONEL ASHLEY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME WHEN THE STORE WAS CLOSED FOR THE NIGHT MINUTELY EXAMINED THE SAFE BUT COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE OF ITS HAVING BEEN TAMPERED WITH
I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO
KING'S DAGGER III
I CAME TO TELL YOU THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY IS SOLVED AND IF YOU WILL LET ME KNOW WHAT I OWE YOU I'LL SEND YOU A CHECK OH THAT PART WILL BE ALL RIGHT MR GRAFTON
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND NOR DO I FLUNG BACK AARON GRAFTON OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE LEFT THE COLONEL'S ROOM RATHER HASTILY
WELL WHAT'S UP NOW FOR A MOMENT THE COLONEL LISTENED INTENTLY MANY EMOTIONS FLASHING ACROSS HIS FACE
COLONEL DONE SAY TO GIVE IT TO YOU FO HURTIN YO FEELIN'S HE DID
NOW LET ME UNDERSTAND YOU ABOUT THIS WATCH MR KETTRIDGE
THE OLD DETECTIVE SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY
LOOK HERE EXCLAIMED THE OLD DETECTIVE
JUST LIKE THIS--YES
YES IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT
I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SWITCH
THEN I THOUGHT OF SALLIE PAGE
IT WILL BE SECLUDED ENOUGH AT THIS TIME AND A LITTLE LATER AMY AND THE COLONEL WERE TALKING
AND HE LIKED YOU
I SENT FOR THE AMBULANCE
WHEN IT DOES IT WILL CREATE A SENSATION NO ALIMONY EH
HE PROBABLY JABBED HIMSELF WITH THE POINT OF THE NEEDLE AND WHATEVER WAS SMEARED ON IT DID THE REST
WONDER WHAT DID IT SHOULDN'T WONDER BUT IT WAS DONE WITH THIS AND THONG HELD OUT ON THE PALM OF HIS LARGE HAND A SLENDER DAGGER ON THE OTHERWISE BRIGHT BLADE OF WHICH WERE SOME DARK STAINS
IT WAS MENTIONED THAT SINGA PHUT WAS BEING KEPT UNDER OBSERVATION THOUGH NO SUSPICION ATTACHED TO HIM
THAT COULDN'T HAVE KILLED HIM I THINK IT DID THOUGH JACK JUST AS IT KILLED SHERE ALI AND JUST AS DO YOU MEAN--THAT'S WHAT KILLED MRS DARCY--THAT WATCH I DON'T KNOW YET JACK BUT HOW COULD IT
AT THE POINT WHERE THE STREAM HAD BITTEN INTO THE HILL IT HAD WASHED FOR ITSELF A DEFILE THE BOTTOM ROCK-COVERED SO THAT THE WATERS SWIRLED OVER IT IN FOAM
OH YES--MAYBE--AND THEN--AGAIN--MAYBE NOT
GOTTA PLEASE WIFELY WHEN YOU--HIC--BEEN OUT AL NIGHT
NO NAMES--HERE WHISPERED THE COLONEL IN THE BIG EAR OF THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED HIM FROM DEATH
THIS HAS UPSET ME FRIGHTFULLY I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD AGREED CASEY
THERE WASN'T ANY USE IN THAT
SLOWLY SHE AND HER LOVER APPROACHED
AND THE MORE HE SAW OF THAT GENTLEMAN THE MORE THE DETECTIVE BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE MERCHANT KNEW SOMETHING OF THE CRIME
THIS DOES BEGIN TO GET INTERESTING HE MUSED AS HE FINISHED READING THE ACCOUNT
ANSWER IT SHAG HE DIRECTED
THE PRESSES ARE LIKE ANIMALS--THEY HAVE TO BE FED YOU KNOW
FOR SHAG I GUESS I WON'T BE NEEDING IT FOR A WEEK OR SO SAID THE OLD DETECTIVE AND THERE WAS A MINGLING OF TWO EMOTIONS IN HIS VOICE
THIS WAS THE EASIER FOR HER SINCE SHE OWNED THE BUILDING IN WHICH HER DISPLAY WAS KEPT AND LIVED IN A QUIET AND TASTEFULLY FURNISHED APARTMENT OVER THE STORE
IT'S LARCH THAT PUZZLES ME YES IT ISN'T USUAL FOR HIM TO MAKE SUCH A CONGENIAL COMPANION OF HIMSELF WITH HIS CUSTOMERS
BUT THERE ENTERED NO BLACK AND SMILING SHAG NOR ONE OF THE HOTEL EMPLOYEES BUT A LITTLE DOG WHICH WAGGED ITS TAIL BOTH IN GREETING TO THE COLONEL SEATED BEFORE A GAS LOG IN HIS ROOM AND ALSO AS A SORT OF APPLAUSE FOR THE DOG ITSELF BECAUSE IT HAD SUCCEEDED IN PUSHING OPEN THE DOOR WHICH WAS LEFT AJAR BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS WAS RATHER STIFF ON THE HINGES
I'M GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO HIM
YOU'RE PRETTY DRUNK YET BUT MAYBE YOU CAN GET THIS THROUGH YOUR NOODLE
WELL I'LL BE BEGAN DONOVAN AND THEN WITH A LOOK AT THE COLONEL HE SUBSTITUTED
I'M GETTING HARDENED TO IT BY NOW WELL THEN YOUR--ARREST
SPOTTY IS A VERITABLE SALMON MUSED THE COLONEL EVEN IF HE IS SPECKLED LIKE A TROUT
THE MEN FROM THE MORGUE HAD THE BODY RAISED IN THE AIR
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE JEWELRY STORE HAVING BEEN ENTERED FROM THE OUTSIDE SO THAT IF A STRANGER HAD COME IN HE MUST HAVE DONE SO WHEN THE DOORS WERE UNLOCKED OR MADE A FALSE KEY OR ELSE HE HAD FORCED A PASSAGE SO SKILFULLY AS TO LEAVE NOT A SIGN
BUT HE DONE WRIT A BOOK ON FISHIN POLES AN DAT'S ALL THE COLONEL READS WHEN HE AIN'T WORKIN MUCH
SO HERE'S SOME TO ENABLE YOU TO KEEP UP TO KING'S PACE OF COURSE IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS COLONEL BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE WIND BLOWS
HE WAS DEAD AT EIGHT
COLONEL ASHLEY SAW HIS ANNOYANCE
YET HE DID NOT TALK WITH THEM BEYOND A MERE PASSING OF THE TIME OF DAY BUT WENT ABOUT NERVOUSLY FROM SHOWCASE TO COUNTER AND REPEATED THE JOURNEY
YES SAH COLONEL YOU STAY HERE UNTIL I COME BACK
THE CROWD FILLED THE ENTIRE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE JEWELRY STORE
I MUST MAKE CERTAIN AND HE PUT THE OLD ROMAN COIN SAFELY AWAY IN HIS WALLET
I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID MULLIGAN AND HE SHOVED HIMSELF TO AN ERECT POSTURE BY FORCING HIS ELBOWS AGAINST THE SHOWCASE ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN LEANING IN A MANNER TO GIVE HIMSELF AS MUCH REST AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT SITTING DOWN--IT WAS A WAY HE HAD ACQUIRED FROM LONG PATROLLING OF CITY STREETS
CHAPTER XVI THE COLONEL WONDERS WHAT DID THAT COLONEL
OUT FROM THE SHADOWS HE SPRANG TO WHIRL BACK THE MAN WHO WITH BLAZING EYES AND MURDEROUS HATE WRITTEN ON HIS FACE CONFRONTED CYNTHIA RATCHFORD
GO ON INTERRUPTED COLONEL ASHLEY
MY GAWD
THE CASE OF THE STATE AGAINST JAMES DARCY POSTPONED FOR TWO WEEKS AND ALL WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION AND FOR THE DEFENCE WILL THEN APPEAR WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE THERE WAS A HUM OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND MOST OF THE CROWD FILED OUT WHEN THE PROSECUTOR MOVED A CASE OF ASSAULT AND BATTERY
HE NEXT APPEARED AT THE JEWELRY STORE AFTER THE MURDER
SHE WAS DOWN FIRST THOUGH WHY I CAN'T SAY
IT WAS ONLY YOUR PROMISE IN THE NOTE THAT BROUGHT ME HERE
MY WIFE--SHE LIKES THEM THINGS
IS YO GWINE BE OUT ALL NIGHT COLONEL ASKED SHAG
TROT ALONG SONNY
WELL I'LL BE AS FRANK AS I CAN
NOW THIS COIN THOUGH TO YOU AND ME IT SHOWS ITSELF AT ONCE TO BE OF GREAT ANTIQUITY MIGHT EASILY BE PASSED IN A HURRY OR TO ONE WHO HAD NOT THE FULL POSSESSION OF HIS SENSES AS A SILVER HALF DOLLAR WHICH IT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES
THAT'S A SQUARE DEAL
YES THANK YOU
THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING IT'S A CUT--A DEEP ONE TOO MURMURED CARROLL AS HE DREW NEARER TO LOOK
THERE'S HARRY KING STILL LOCKED UP NO HE ISN'T COLONEL HE ISN'T CRIED THE OLD DETECTIVE AND THERE WAS SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE
IT MEANS ONLY ANOTHER STEP HOWEVER A STEP I HAVE ALREADY COUNTED ON
NOT AT ALL LIKE THAT SAID DARCY AND THERE WAS THE TRACE OF A SMILE ON HIS FACE
SOMEBODY'S BEEN HURT--KILLED--A RELATIVE OF MINE
HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP FROM SLIPPING FROM UNDER HIS VEST WHERE HE HAD HIDDEN IT A NEWSPAPER WITH GLARING BLACK HEADLINES
FROM WHAT SPOTTY SAYS THEY GOT IN AARON GRAFTON'S DEPARTMENT STORE OPENED THE SAFE THE WAY IKE ALWAYS DOES BY LISTENING TO THE TUMBLERS IN THE LOCK AND TOOK OUT SOME JEWELRY
SHE HAD IT ON WHEN WE WERE OUT WALKING TOGETHER AND--WELL IT BECAME DAMAGED AND I ASKED HER TO LET ME TAKE IT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED NOTHING VERY COMPLICATED OR TROUBLESOME IN THAT
HOW BY THROWING OVER A SWITCH ON THE WORK BENCH WHERE JAMES DARCY USED TO BUSY HIMSELF AN ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S WORK BENCH YES COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF
WHAT MAKES IT SOUND SO PLAIN ASKED TREMLAIN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN GASPED THE COLONEL HIS APPREHENSION GROWING
HOLD HIM
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER ASKED CARROLL
IN FACT THE JEWELER HALF AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR TO APPROACH THE THREE SWAGGERING MEN IN THE CAFE SECTION OF THE GRILL WHEN COLONEL ASHLEY LAID A RESTRAINING HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF HIS NEW FRIEND
HIS EYES WENT TO THE CLOSET WHERE HE HAD PUT AWAY HIS FISHING RODS
SINGA PHUT WHOSE WATCH WAS FOUND CLASPED IN THE DEAD WOMAN'S HAND HAD BEEN CLOSELY QUESTIONED BUT HAD ESTABLISHED A PERFECT ALIBI
AND TO THINK I WAS OFFERING HIM A DETECTIVE YARN
OH--WHO--WHO ARE YOU GASPED THE WOMAN AS THE COLONEL STEPPED BETWEEN HER AND THE MAN HE HAD MAIMED
BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES IN ME DOESN'T SHE HE ASKED EAGERLY
WHAT SHOCKED HER THE SAME ELECTRIC WIRES ON THE SHOWCASE THAT SHOCKED MISS BRILL THE OTHER DAY
PERHAPS THE LESS YOU TALK THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE
GREAT SCOTT SHAG
I'LL MAKE HIM WISH HE HADN'T COME BETWEEN US WITH HIS PROTECTING WAYS AND HIS DIAMOND CROSS THAT HE GOES SO SECRETLY TO HAVE MENDED
NO WHY NOT BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE HERE
THIS MAN A DETECTIVE FROM THE COLONEL'S OFFICE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY WIRE TO GO TO A CERTAIN CITY AND THERE WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF REQUISITION PAPERS WHICH SPOTTY MORE OR LESS GENEROUSLY WAIVED BRING ON THE PRISONER
I DIDN'T GET A GLIMPSE AT THE STONES THEMSELVES
THEY HAD BECOME FRIENDS SINCE THE COLONEL'S FIRST VISIT TO THE STORE AND THE FRIENDSHIP HAD GROWN AS THEY FOUND THEY HAD CONGENIAL TASTES
IT WAS OFTEN CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM THAT THOUGH HE BECAME VERY MUCH INTOXICATED YET AT TIMES UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS HARRY KING'S LANGUAGE APPROACHED THE CULTURED RATHER THAN DEGENERATED INTO THE COMMON TALK OF THE ORDINARY DRUNK
I DON'T INTEND ANY ONE SHALL KNOW I'M HERE EITHER
KNOW WHEN YOU'LL BE BACK ASKED BASSET
I WONDER MUSED THE COLONEL WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS IN COMING TO THE DARCY PLACE AND NOSING AROUND AS HE DID
THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE KILLING BUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ALARM--THE STRUGGLE WOULD HAVE MADE A NOISE OBJECTED JACK YOUNG
OH SURE ASSENTED THE JEWELRY WORKER
BUT I WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE SHOWCASE WIRES WHICH WHEN I TESTED THEM WERE DEAD COULD HAVE IN SOME MANNER BECOME CHARGED AND HAVE GIVEN MRS DARCY A SHOCK THAT MIGHT HAVE SENT HER REELING TO THE FLOOR TOPPLING THE HEAVY STATUE OVER ON HER HEAD AND SO KILLING HER BY ACCIDENT DO YOU MEAN ASKED DARCY HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH HOPE
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THIS WAS A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL DAY YO SUAH DID COLONEL WAS THE CHUCKLING ANSWER
IT ISN'T EXACTLY THE SAME FOR MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T LOSE YOUR LIFE
THATSH ME--SURE THASH MINE AND CAREFULLY TRYING TO BALANCE HIMSELF HE REACHED FORWARD AS THOUGH TO TAKE THE STAINED DAGGER FROM THE HAND OF THE DETECTIVE
FINE
HE HAD A VIOLENT TEMPER DRUNK OR SOBER ONCE IT WAS ROUSED AND IT DID NOT TAKE MUCH LIQUOR TO MAKE HIM A VERITABLE DEVIL
I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THAT
STAND BACK
YES SAH AND HE MADE A MOTION TOWARD THE PAPER THAT WAS SLIPPING FROM UNDER HIS VEST
SHE THOUGHT I SHOULD DEVOTE IT ALL TO HER INTERESTS EVEN OUTSIDE THE SHOP
I'LL CALL HER DARCY MADE A MOVE AS THOUGH TO GO TO THE REAR OF THE STORE WHENCE A SIDE DOOR GAVE ENTRANCE TO THE STAIRS LEADING TO THE ROOMS ABOVE
I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE TUSH
THAT'S WHY I CAME RIGHT ON TO SEE YOU
YES SHAG WHAT IS IT
WHEN MR KETTRIDGE ASKED HIM AT WHAT HE DESIRED TO LOOK HE REPLIED THERE WAS NOTHING IN PARTICULAR--THAT HE HAD IN MIND A GIFT BUT AS YET HAD DECIDED ON NOTHING
BEFORE HE WAS ONLY SUSPECTED EVEN THOUGH FORMALLY CHARGED
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT
AND YET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MRS DARCY MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE WATCH KILLED BY IT?--HOW GASPED JACK YOUNG
BUT FOR A TIME THE ENTERTAINMENTS WERE KEPT UP AND CYNTHIA LOVELIER THAN EVER PRESIDED AT HER HUSBAND'S TABLE GRACED IT WITH HER PRESENCE AND LAUGHED AND SMILED AT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAME TO PARTAKE OF THEIR LAVISH HOSPITALITY
RAINING MURMURED JAMES DARCY AS HE REACHED OVER TO SWITCH ON THE LIGHT ABOVE THE LITTLE TABLE WHERE HE SET PRECIOUS STONES INTO GOLD AND PLATINUM OF RARE AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS
WHAT'S UP BILL LOOK EXCLAIMED CARROLL POINTING
IF WE TRY TO CARRY HIM OUT THERE'LL BE MORE OF A PUSH THAN THERE IS NOW
WHAT I CAME TO SEE ABOUT IS WHETHER YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW HIM OUT OF TOWN
COULD I HIRE YOU TO TAKE ME TO THAT BROOK YOU SPOKE OF WHERE YOU SAY THERE ARE SUCH BIG FISH SURE YOU COULD THE BOY ANSWERED EAGERLY AS HE POCKETED THE MONEY
I MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE IT
I'M GOING OUT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME I'LL BE IN
NOT A CLOCK TICKING
HE WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT IN DOC YES THEY GO QUICK THAT WAY ARE YOU SURE IT WAS HEART DISEASE DR WARREN ASKED THE COLONEL
MURDERS AND AUTOPSIES WERE ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WITH HIM
IT WAS HIS THIRD VISIT TO HEADQUARTERS THAT DAY IN SEARCH OF DOCTOR WARREN AND HE WOULD STATE THE OBJECT OF HIS SEEKING TO NONE OTHER
YOU SPOKE ABOUT A CARP--THE RIGHT MAN OH I--I WAS JUST THINKING OF SOMETHING IN WALTON
AND OFTEN WHEN SOME FASTIDIOUS CUSTOMER DID NOT SEEM TO CARE FOR WHAT WAS SHOWN FROM THE GLITTERING TRAYS IN THE SHOWCASES MRS DARCY OR ONE OF HER CLERKS WOULD SAY
HOWEVER I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE TOO FAR AFIELD
IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT BUT AMY--AND THE DISGRACE SHE DOESN'T CONSIDER HERSELF DISGRACED AND YOU SHOULDN'T
GOT A PLACE WHERE I CAN WASH MY HANDS HE ASKED
NONE OF THE DETAILS WAS LACKING THOUGH THE GRUESOMENESS WAS SKILFULLY COVERED WITH SOME WELL-DONE DESCRIPTIVE WRITING
THE RESCUER WHO HAD BEEN GRINNING CHEERFULLY WENT WHITE UNDER HIS COPPER FRECKLES
WELL NOW YOU BLACK RASCAL DID YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT A NEWSPAPER WITH AN ACCOUNT IN IT OF A STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS MURDER RIGHT HERE IN THIS CITY YES SAH COLONEL
TOM CAME AND TOLD ME AND SAID WE MUST GET COLONEL BRENTNALL AT ONCE
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU WAS THE COLONEL'S GREETING
I'M NOT SO SURE THE COLONEL'S REMARKS WERE INTERRUPTED BY PECULIAR ACTIONS ON THE PART OF CHET
TO HER FEW INTIMATES IT WAS KNOWN THAT CYNTHIA HAD GONE TO THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF POMPEY WHERE HER FATHER OWNED A SMALL SUMMER HOME
HE TOO MADE LITTLE RINGS OF WATER ON THE TABLE
THEY'LL NOTIFY HIM FROM THE PRECINCT
HOW IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN DID YOU KNOW THAT HE CRIED
SINGA SEES IT AND FEARFUL OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN HE RUSHES IN AND TRIES TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HER
IT WAS IN GETTING UP EARLY TO DO THIS AND HAVE THE TIMEPIECE READY WHEN PROMISED THAT HE DISCOVERED HIS RELATIVE'S DEAD BODY WHERE DID HARRY KING GET THAT ODD COIN WHICH MADE IT LOOK BAD IN HIS CASE FOR A WHILE ASKED MR MASON
BUT THEN SHE MAY HAVE HAD A PRIVATE STOCK OF WHICH DARCY NOR I KNEW NOTHING
BUT DON'T KEEP US WAITING ALL DAY
BY THE BONES OF SIR IZAAK CRIED THE COLONEL I'VE HOOKED ONE SHAG DE LORD BE PRAISED
HE'S GONE THAT'S IT ON BAIL
AS I HAVE SHOWED YOU THE POISON NEEDLE COULD ONLY BE MADE TO PROTRUDE WHEN THE WATCH REACHED A CERTAIN TIME WHICH TIME COULD BE SET IN ADVANCE AS AN ALARM CLOCK IS SET
LOOKS MORE LIKE HER HEAD'S BEEN BUSTED IN
MOST INVENTORS ARE CRAZY ANYHOW
IT WAS THIS--THIS BOOK THAT I USED RATHER ROUGHLY AND WHICH AWAKENED YOU THEN AREN'T WE AT COLCHESTER YET NO MADAM
I WAS FOOLISH TO LET MYSELF BE DRAGGED INTO THIS
IT WON'T DO NOW HE SAID GENTLY
SO CHEER UP AND I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU
BUT THE CELL WAS AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN THE FINAL SUMMONS CAME TO THE EAST INDIAN
BUT--NOW HE DID NOT FINISH BUT A SHUDDER SEEMED TO SHAKE HIS FRAME
I'LL TELL HER THE COLONEL SPENT THAT EVENING IN THE GRILL ROOM OF THE HOMESTEAD
IN FACT IT WAS THE OPINION OF COLONEL ASHLEY THAT SOME FORM OF SNAKE POISON WAS USED THOUGH WHAT IT WAS NO ONE COULD SAY
HEAD'S BADLY CUT--LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE
NO SOONER HAD I CLOSED THE CIRCUIT THAN I HEARD A SCREAM FROM SALLIE AND SAW HER FALL BACKWARDS
USE THE STATUE THAT WAY WHY NOT WELL--ER--I--WE WERE GOING TO BUY IT FOR OUR NEW HOME
WELL IT WON'T BE SO HORRIBLE FROM NOW ON
I'M SO GLAD AND HER EYES BEAMED
HE MUST BE PRETTY OLD NOW I KNOW HE IS--BUT NOT TOO OLD TO TAKE HOLD
SO DON'T LET THAT INFLUENCE YOU
MRS DARCY HAD RATHER LAUGHED AT HIM JAMES SAID FOR THINKING OF MARRYING A GIRL SO MUCH WEALTHIER THAN HE WAS
HIS NERVES WERE BEGINNING TO GO BACK ON HIM HE FEARED
I MEAN OF COURSE LEAVING JIMMIE OUT FOR I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID IT COULD NOT SINGA PHUT HAVE DONE IT ASKED COLONEL ASHLEY QUIETLY
AND I DON'T EVEN FOR THAT KNOW WHY I CAME HERE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I OUGHT TO BE NOW THE COLORED MAN PAUSED A MOMENT BEFORE REPLYING
QUITE A CURIOSITY SAID THE COLONEL AT LENGTH
IF I SEE YOU AGAIN AND THIS THING HANGS OVER YOU I MAY HAVE TO PULL YOU UP ALL RIGHT COLONEL
THE COUPLE TURNED TOWARD THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE WHERE ON A HILL KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE HEIGHTS THERE WAS A GROVE OF TREES
WHY SURE IF IT WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD SAID THE HEADQUARTERS MAN WHEN THE COLONEL HAD MADE KNOWN HIS DESIRE
THEY MIGHT FALL OUT THAT WOULDN'T HURT COLONEL
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE ELECTRIC SWITCH ON DARCY'S TABLE WAS THE ANSWER
THEN PROVE IT BY NOT ASKING ME TO PLAY MY HAND BEFORE I HAVE ALL THE CARDS I WANT
I MEAN I NEVER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MIXED UP WITH THIS AFFAIR--THIS DETECTIVE BUSINESS
BUT MAYBE IT WILL TURN OUT FOR THE BEST
HE HAS A CURIO STORE DOWN ON WATER STREET
BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED MY COUSIN I THINK I DO THEN FOR THE LOVE OF I CAN'T TELL YOU YET DARCY
HE DESCRIBED HOW DARCY COMING DOWN IN THE GRAY DAWN HAD DISCOVERED THE WOMAN LYING STARK AND COLD HER HEAD CRUSHED AND A STAB WOUND IN HER SIDE
THIS TIME IT WAS A RING OF HIS ROOM TELEPHONE
I'M SURE I DIDN'T
JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HAND--AND IN A WOMAN'S OH NOT AT ALL WAS THE QUICK ANSWER
BUT HIS PATIENCE WAS NOT TRIED LONG FOR PRESENTLY A VEILED WOMAN EMERGED FROM THE HOUSE
I AM AS SHAG CALLS IT DETECTIN AND I JUST CAME OUT HERE TO CLARIFY MY THOUGHTS
ASIDE FROM A LITTLE SCRATCH NEAR THE PRISONER'S HEART WHERE HE HAD EVIDENTLY DUG THE NEEDLE DEEP INTO HIS SKIN THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT DEATH WAS OTHER THAN BY NATURAL CAUSES
SAY LOOK HERE BOYS HE EXCLAIMED WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF MANNER AS SOMETHING SEEMED TO PENETRATE TO HIS SODDEN BRAIN YOU--YOU DON'T FOR A MINUTE THINK I DID THIS--DO YOU AND HE SAT UP STRAIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU TREATED ME WHITE AND WHEN I HEARD MISS MASON WAS IN TROUBLE--OR HER FRIEND WAS--I SAID TO MYSELF RIGHT AWAY THAT YOU WAS THE ONE TO FIX THINGS
I KNEW IT SHAG STOOD RESTING HIS WEIGHT FIRST ON ONE FOOT AND THEN ON THE OTHER HIS HEAD BOWED
THE BLOODSTONES STRANGE THAT JAMES DARCY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THEM AS HE LOOKED AT THE RAIN OUTSIDE HEARD ITS DRIP DRIP DRIP ON THE WINDOWS AND SAW THE FOG AND SWIRLS OF MIST INSIDE AND WITHOUT THE STORE
I'LL EXPECT YOU SOON
IT'S A SWELL ONE LET ME TELL YOU OH MAH GOOD LORD EJACULATED SHAG
THAT WILL TAKE A FEW DAYS BUT I CAN DO IT WHILE I'M HERE ARRANGING FOR THE FUNERAL NOT HERE YOU CAN'T DO IT BROKE IN CARROLL WITH A SHORT LAUGH
JUST AS THERE MIGHT BE MANY WAYS TO ACCOUNT FOR KING'S HAVING POSSESSION OF THIS COIN
CHET POISONED SORROWFULLY ENOUGH COLONEL ASHLEY TOLD HOW IT HAD HAPPENED SHOWING THE POISONED WATCH BUT NOT DISCLOSING THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE ONE WHICH HAD FIGURED IN THE DEATHS OF MRS DARCY AND SHERE ALI
I DIDN'T NOTICE ABOUT THAT
YOU'RE PRETTY DRUNK FOR A FACT BUT DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE YOU WERE AND WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT--AND EARLY THIS MORNING
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN I'D RUN INTO SOMETHING WHEN I CAME HERE FOR REST DAT'S RIGHT COLONEL
THE WATCH BELONGING TO AN INDIAN NAMED SINGA PHUT
I HAVE MONEY IN MY OWN RIGHT
THE WOMAN WAS STILL IN SIGHT AND BEFORE SHE REACHED THE STATION THE MAN WHO HAD SENT THE NOTE CAME OUT AND MET HER ON THE DRIVEWAY
SILENTLY HE TURNED THE KNOB BUT BEFORE HE HAD STEPPED OVER THE THRESHHOLD HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING SOFTLY
I'VE GOT TO DO A LITTLE FINE WORK NOW
THAT IS MY NAME YES SIR
THE WHOLE CROSS IS MADE OF PHONEY DIAMONDS--PASTE PASTE DIAMONDS
THERE'S BEEN A MURDER A MURDER ECHOED THE MIST
I MUST HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AROUND THE JEWELRY STORE A DAY OR SO AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE WEST THE COLONEL MADE A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE SHOP
THIS IS AN OLD-TIMER
I'M GOING TO GET AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING IF THIS INFERNAL RAIN LETS UP
AS SOON AS I AWAKENED WHERE IS YOUR ROOM IN THE REAR ON THE SECOND FLOOR--THE ONE NEXT ABOVE
IT'S PROBABLY A ROBBERY
I DIDN'T FORGET YOU SPOTTY
WELL CYNTHIA AND I ARE FRIENDS--GOOD FRIENDS
NO I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
AT LAST THE WOMAN HALTING NEAR THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF BEYOND WHICH THE WOODS WERE THICKER FACED THE MAN
THE OLD COLORED MAN WRAPPED IN A WARM COAT FOR IT WAS NOT SUMMER YET SEEMED TO BE ENJOYING HIS SIESTA WHEN WITH A SUDDENNESS THAT WAS STARTLING IN THAT SOLITUDE THE MILITARY DETECTIVE UTTERED A CRY OF
SCHMIDT SAID HE HEARD THE FOREIGNER BREATHING AWFUL FUNNY
YOU'D BETTER COME IN HERE AND SIT DOWN A WHILE HARRY HE WENT ON AND HE LED THE UNSTEADY YOUNG MAN TO THE REAR ROOM WHILE THE MEN FROM THE MORGUE CARRIED OUT THE LIFELESS BODY
IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY COME TO ME HE ADDED AS HE HANDED OVER A ROLL OF BILLS
HOW ABOUT THAT MR DARCY WELL NO
IT WAS A SKILFUL BIT OF SHADOWING THE DETECTIVE DID ON THE JOURNEY TO THE METROPOLIS SO SKILFUL THAT THOUGH THE MERCHANT PLAINLY SHOWED BY HIS NERVOUSNESS THAT HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED HE DID NOT SEEMINGLY SUSPECT THE QUIET MAN SEATED NOT FAR FROM HIM READING A LITTLE GREEN BOOK
YES THIS IS COLONEL ASHLEY ANNOUNCED THE DETECTIVE INTO THE INSTRUMENT WHEN HIS IDENTITY HAD BEEN QUESTIONED
SHAG EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL WHEN THEY WERE TRAMPING THROUGH A FIELD NEAR THE RIVER HAVING REACHED THAT VANTAGE POINT BY A MOST PROSAIC TROLLEY CAR THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY IT SUAH AM SAH AND I'M GOING TO CATCH SOME FINE FISH I SUAH DOES HOPE SO COLONEL ALL RIGHT THEN
I MUST GO TO SEE DARCY THE PRISONER WAS MEASURABLY STARTLED WHEN THE DETECTIVE TOLD HIM THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT AT THE JEWELRY STORE
THOUGH AFTER HIS FIRST WILD BURST HE BECAME MAUDLIN AND SILLY
THROUGH UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
THIS AMONG OTHER THINGS COLONEL ASHLEY LEARNED WHEN HE HASTENED TO THE JEWELRY STORE FROM THE HOMESTEAD LEAVING AT THE LATTER PLACE HIS TRUSTY LIEUTENANT JACK YOUNG TO LOOK AFTER BOTH LARCH AND HARRY KING NEITHER OF WHOM SEEMED LIKELY TO LEAVE THE PLACE VERY SOON
COLONEL ASHLEY DRAWING SOMETHING FROM HIS POCKET TOOK A STEP NEARER THE MAIMED MAN
FIRST THE BLOW ON THE HEAD FOLLOWED BY THE STAB WOUND AND THERE WERE NO OTHER INJURIES ON THE BODY NONE EXCEPT MINOR BRUISES CAUSED BY THE FALL TO THE FLOOR
IT MAY BE THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOCKS GIVEN
OH HE SAYS HE DID IT ALL RIGHT
SPOTTY MY NAME'S BRENTNALL FOR THE PRESENT SAID THE COLONEL WITH A GRIM SMILE
POLICE HEADQUARTERS NUMBER IS I KNOW IT INTERRUPTED CASEY
ANY MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND TO MISS MASON ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SPECIAL SALE OF A MEDIUM-PRICED LINE OF GOODS TO-MORROW
I'VE GOT TO TELEPHONE AND HE HURRIED TO A PRIVATE BOOTH IN A BACK OFFICE LEAVING GRAFTON TO HIMSELF
AS YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED IT'S A DIVORCE CASE I HAVE JUST FINISHED AND SO QUIETLY THAT IT HASN'T BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY YET
YOUR OLD LOVER GRAFTON
WHO ELSE COULD HAVE CROAKED HER PURSUED CARROLL
THE COLONEL WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIMSELF FOR HE HAD PUT ASIDE IN THE PERUSAL OF WALTON ALL THOUGHTS OF THE MURDER AND ITS MANY COMPLICATIONS WHEN THERE CAME ANOTHER INTERRUPTION
THE EVENING PASSED PLEASANTLY FOR THEM
QUITE AN OLD LADY HE MUSED AS HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT WHICH CARROLL HELD FOR HIM
IT WAS NOT A CELL--YET THOUGH IT WOULD SEEM LIKELY TO COME TO THAT FOR THONG OBSERVED TO HIS PARTNER AS THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS
INDICTED X
NOW THAT HE WAS GETTING OLD HE HAD SOME ABLE ASSISTANTS BUT MOST CASES STILL RECEIVED HIS OWN ATTENTION AT SOME STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT
OH THAT GINK
I WONDER--I WONDER IF SHE'LL HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME AFTER THIS
SOON IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE AFTER KENNETH HAD CONFERRED BRIEFLY WITH HIS CLIENT
BUT AS I AM ALREADY ENGAGED ON THAT TO TRY TO CLEAR DARCY I CAN AS WELL INCLUDE THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY ALSO
UP AND DOWN DOWN AND UP NOW PAUSING TO TAKE HIS HANDS FROM THEIR STRAINED POSITION CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK THAT THEY MIGHT GRASP THE COLD BARS OF HIS CELL DOOR--SLIM WHITE HANDS THAT HAD SET MANY A GLEAMING JEWEL IN BURNISHED GOLD OR COLD GLITTERING PLATINUM THAT IT MIGHT GRACE THE PERSON OF SOME SWEET WOMAN
THE BODY OF THE MURDERED WOMAN HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FOLLOWED BY A SIGH OF RELIEF FROM JAMES DARCY WHO TRY AS HE DID COULD NOT KEEP HIS EYES FROM SEEKING IT
I MAY NEED IT AS EVIDENCE WHEN WE GET MR PHUT OR WHATEVER THE DAGO'S NAME IS OH NO I WOULDN'T THINK OF TAKING IT AWAY
AH SO THAT'S THE GAME IS IT HE CRIED
THEY SAY I CAN'T STAY VERY LONG SO I'LL HAVE TO TALK FAST AND YOU MUST LISTEN--MOSTLY
SOMETHING AWAKENED ME SUDDENLY
I'VE SEEN HEAPS OF MEN READ DETECTIVE STORIES
COME ALONG IT WAS RAINING WHEN THEY REACHED THE JAIL AND THE COLONEL AS HE HEARD THE PATTER OF DROPS THOUGHT OF THE NIGHT HE HAD FIRST COME TO COLCHESTER
YES WHERE DID SHE GET IT
I DON'T LIKE TO CALL ON YOU THUS OPENLY FOR IT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS BUT OH DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU
I COULDN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAID MR KETTRIDGE SAID CARROLL AND I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE TRIED NOT TO IF I COULD
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND IS STILL A HANDSOME WOMAN THOUGH TROUBLE HAS LEFT ITS MARK ON HER
IT IS ONLY A LITTLE SHOOT ON THE MAIN STEM
THE WIRES MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE I USED THEM THAT WILL BE LOOKED INTO
NOW LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
THERE ARE SOME OTHERS IN THIS CITY I NEED TO SHADOW YOU DON'T MEAN SINGA PHUT NO HE'S IN CUSTODY
THEN I'VE GOT TO TRAVEL ON--CUSTOMERS WAITING FOR ME YOU--YOU WON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE--WILL YOU ASKED DARCY
AND SO DARCY CHANGED HIS MIND--HE RAN TO THE SIDE DOOR FUMBLED WITH THE LOCK FLUNG BACK THE PORTAL AND THEN RUSHED OUT IN THE RAIN AND DRIZZLE THE FOG STREAMING AFTER MM AS HE PARTED THE MIST LIKE LONG WHITE STREAMERS OF RIBBON SUCH AS THEY SUSPEND AT THE DOOR FOR THE VERY YOUNG OR THE AGED
AND CARROLL AND THONG WHO WITH OTHER HEADQUARTERS MEN NOW KNEW THE COLONEL'S IDENTITY WERE NOT ABOVE LEARNING A TRICK OR TWO EVEN IF THEY HAD TO TAKE THEM FROM THE BOOK OF THEIR RIVAL
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HOW IT WOULD BE SHAG HE REMARKED ALMOST MOURNFULLY
YOU MAY KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS MURDER THAN YOU'RE TELLING ME EVEN CONSIDERING THE LATEST FROM MY FRIEND SPOTTY
AS SOON AS I HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED--TO HIM--I WANTED TO HELP
AND IT WAS IN THIS DEBRIS CAREFULLY POKED OVER WITH A LEAD PENCIL THAT A NEEDLE WAS FOUND
I'LL NOT GO MYSELF IT'S TOO RISKY
EVIDENTLY HE HAD GIVEN SERIOUS OFFENSE
I'M SORRY I CAN'T OFFER ANY EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR CLIENT WOULDN'T ACCEPT MONEY WHEN SHE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO IT
NO SHE HAD NO ENEMIES
THEN YOU THINK DARCY IS CLEARED OF ANY CONNECTION WITH THE POISON WATCH ASKED THE COLONEL
SHE WILL BE GETTING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER DIAMONDS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT SHE SAYS WHEN SHE HEARS THE TRUTH THOUGH COLONEL ASHLEY HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPES OF HAVING A USE FOR HIS BELOVED FISHING RODS AND FLIES AT LEAST ON THIS TRIP TO COLCHESTER HE DID NOT GIVE UP HIS PERUSAL OF WALTON'S BOOK
THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE
COME ON MORNING BOYS
IN SPITE OF THE STORM THE CROWD GREW AND REMAINED
EITHER IT WAS A NOISE OR IT WASN'T
BUT I'M COMING BACK
WE CAN GET EM AFTER THEY FINISH THEIR ROUTES UM ASSENTED THONG
IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE BUT A DIAMOND CROSS
AND BE CAREFUL OF MY RODS WHEN YOU TAKE THE GRIPS OFF
HE STARTED BACK AS THOUGH SOME ONE HAD STRUCK HIM A BLOW
I KNOW THIS IS THE END
I'LL HOLD AN AUTOPSY IN THE MORNING
SHE UNDERSTOOD IT AND IT UNDERSTOOD HER
HE OUGHT TO KNOW I'VE VOWED NOT TO LOOK AT A PAPER FOR TWO WEEKS AND AS FOR BOOKS COLONEL ROBERT LEE ASHLEY CLOSED HIS VOLUME WHICH BORE IN GOLD LETTERS ON THE FRONT GREEN COVER THE WORDS
I HAD TO BE A BIT CAUTIOUS YOU KNOW AND EVEN NOW I THINK THEY'RE SUSPICIOUS OF ME HERE
HAVE HIM SPEND A FEW DAYS WITH YOU UNTIL I CAN INVITE HIM TO MY COUNTRY PLACE I HATE TO DO IT AFTER WHAT HE DID FOR ME MUSED THE COLONEL WITH A SIGH
NOT A SCRATCH ON THE PLACE
I DON'T IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT FOOL KING HAD A HAND IN THIS AFFAIR
I USED TO KNOW CYNTHIA WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL--SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF LODAN RATCHFORD AND HER MOTHER HAD PECULIAR AND TO MY MIND WRONG IDEAS OF SOCIAL POSITION AND MONEY
HE RAISED THE HOWL RIGHT OFF AND PINKUS AND I GOT THERE AS SOON AS WE COULD
IF YOU DON'T BY ALL THE SHE TORE HERSELF AWAY FROM HIM AND TURNED TO FLEE BUT HE WAS TOO QUICK FOR HER AND WAS ABOUT TO ENCIRCLE HER IN HIS ARMS WHEN SHE SHRANK BACK AND GAVE A DESPAIRING CRY
SEEN THAT COLONEL GUY TO-DAY ASKED CARROLL
LEAVING DARCY OUT OF IT AND ASSUMING THAT HE HAD LEFT THE WATCH ON HIS TABLE INTENDING TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND FIX IT WHAT IS TO HAVE PREVENTED MRS DARCY FROM COMING DOWN TO HER STORE--SAY BEFORE MIDNIGHT AFTER DARCY LEFT HER
THEN AS HE LISTENED HIS EARS ATTUNED WITH FEAR HE KNEW IT WAS THE TICKING OF THE WATCH IN THE HAND OF THE DEAD WOMAN
BESIDES ANYTHING I COULD SAY NOW WOULDN'T SET YOU FREE
HE'S GOT A FUNNY NAME TOO
HE FIGURED OUT CRAZILY ENOUGH IN HIS FEAR AND DRUNKEN FRENZY THAT IF NO CLOCKS OR WATCHES WERE GOING NO ONE WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TIME THE KILLING TOOK PLACE
GAD HE EXCLAIMED
I'VE DONE IT LOTS OF TIMES OF COURSE AGREED THE COLONEL SMILING
WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN A ROBBERY
I'LL WIRE FOR KEDGE TO-NIGHT TO COME ON AND TAKE UP THE CASE
OH I SEE
I FORGET JUST WHY I DIDN'T DO IT AND DARCY SEEMED A BIT CONFUSED A POINT NOT LOST SIGHT OF BY CARROLL
THEN REMEMBERING IT EARLY IN THE MORNING--PERHAPS FEELING GUILTY AT HAVING SPENT PART OF THE NIGHT WORKING ON HIS ELECTRIC LATHE--HE GOT UP TO DO AS HE HAD PROMISED AND FINDS HIS COUSIN DEAD INTERRUPTED MR KETTRIDGE
HAVE YOU LOOKED OVER THE STOCK ALL YOU WANT TO THEY WERE IN A ROOM IN THE REAR OF THE JEWELRY STORE--THE CITY AND COUNTY DETECTIVES THE REPORTERS AND JAMES DARCY--WITH POLICEMAN MULLIGAN ON GUARD NEAR THE CUT GLASS AND SILVER GLEAMING IN THE SHOWCASES
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME ABOUT BEING ROBBED MAYBE HE DIDN'T COUNT THIS IT NOT BEING WORTH MUCH AND BASSET FLIPPED THE SPARKLING CROSS HALF WAY ACROSS THE TABLE
THEY'LL LET YOU SEE HIM IF I'M WITH YOU
ARE THERE ANY GOOD STREAMS ARE THERE
YOU PUT UP THIS LITTLE GAME WITH YOUR LOVER GRAFTON DID YOU
YOU KNOW HE WAS WORKING ON AN ELECTRIC LATHE HE HOPED TO PATENT
AND AS YOU SAY JACK IF KING OR LARCH SOLD SOME LOOSE DIAMONDS IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
HERE I COME TO THIS PLACE TO HAVE SOME QUIET FISHING IN THE SUBURBS TO GET A COMPLETE REST AND YET NOT BE TOO FAR FROM CIVILIZATION AND NO SOONER DO I GET OFF THE TRAIN THAN THERE'S A MURDER MYSTERY THRUST RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE
IT'S A MAN--A INDIAN MAN WHUT KEPT A CURIOSITY SHOP--DE SAME PLACE WHERE YO AN ME WAS LOOKIN AT DEM FUNNY SNAKE CANDLESTICKS LAS WEEK SINGA PHUT'S PLACE
I TOLD YOU HE WAS AS FIRM A BELIEVER IN YOU AS I AM--THAT HE SAID HE'D GO THE LIMIT IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO GET YOU FREE
MAYBE I CAN SHOW YOU COLONEL ASHLEY CAREFULLY GATHERED UP ALL THE CIGARETTES IN THE CELL A NUMBER OF THEM BEING PERFECT
SHE MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT A BURGLAR AT WORK AND HE MAY HAVE KILLED HER TO GET AWAY
THAT'S A SHAME
I DON'T EVEN CLAIM THE POISON-NEEDLE WATCH KILLED MRS DARCY OR SHERE ALI
WELL I'LL BE THERE AT THE FINISH AND I THINK THIS WILL BE THE FINISH HE WENT ON GRIMLY AS HE THRUST HIS HAND INTO HIS SIDE POCKET WHERE THE HOOKS JINGLED WITH GRIM MUSIC
THEY MAY TURN THE SCALE IN OUR FAVOR
IF YOU TOUCH ME
I NEVER CAN GET A LITTLE VACATION
SHAG YES SAH COLONEL EH--SHAG--BEFORE YOU GO YOU--ER--YOU MIGHT LEAVE ME THAT PAPER I SEE UNDER YOUR VEST
DIDN'T SPOTTY CONFESS TO STEALING THIS DIAMOND CROSS FROM MRS DARCY AND KILLING HER BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT COLONEL THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE COME ON THE CASE AND ALL I KNOW IS I WAS SENT ON TO BRING SPOTTY BACK
THE OLD LADY AGAIN COMPOSED HERSELF
THE ONLY EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM JUST AS IT HAS BEEN ALL ALONG IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL
ANSWER THEM AND AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE
HERE HE IS NOW
OF COURSE NEITHER SHERE ALI NOR SINGA PHUT MAY HAVE HAD THE GERMS ABOUT THEM BUT I AM A BIT SQUEAMISH WHEN IT COMES TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF THAT NATURE AND I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SCRATCH MYSELF ON THAT WATCH SCRATCH YOURSELF--ON A WATCH AND DONOVAN'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SKEPTICAL
SPOTTY KEPT THE CROSS AND THOUGHT HE'D HAVE ENOUGH SALTED DOWN WHEN HE SOLD IT TO LIVE EASY FOR A WHILE
FISHIN OR DETECTIN
BUT THEY WERE SUPERFICIAL NOTHING ELSE NO--UM LET ME SEE--NO I THINK NOT ARE YOU SURE DR WARREN THE COLONEL'S VOICE HAD A STRANGE RING IN IT
THERE WILL BE A SENSATION WHEN THIS COMES OUT AND THERE WAS WHEN DALEY OF THE TIMES SCOOPED THE OTHER REPORTERS AND SPRANG HIS SENSATIONAL STORY OF THE SEPARATION OF THE LARCHS THE CASE HAVING BEEN HEARD IN CAMERA BY THE VICE CHANCELLOR
OH SO THAT'S WHAT KING HEARD ABOUT AN ELECTRIC LATHE I SUPPOSE SO
IT'S JEST HIS WAY THE TRAIN RUMBLED ON THROUGH THE EARLY NIGHT AND IN HIS COMFORTABLE CHAIR COLONEL ASHLEY READ HIS WALTON THE INGRATIATING HUMOR OF THE DEAR OLD FISHERMAN GRADUALLY DISPELLING ALL OTHER THOUGHTS
MOST OF THE DEBRIS WAS CIGARETTE ASH AND SCRAPS OF PAPER AND TOBACCO
NOT UNTIL AFTER SHE WAS--DEAD UM
SALLIE PAGE COULD TELL NOTHING THE MAID WAS OUT OF THE CITY AND NONE OF THE CLERKS KNEW MORE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAN THEY WERE TOLD
HE WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE WATCH WHICH HE STILL HELD IN THE PALM OF THE HAND--HOLDING IT AS CAREFULLY AS THOUGH INDEED IT MIGHT BE LADEN WITH GERMS THE LEAST TOUCH OF WHICH AGAINST A TINY SCRATCH MIGHT PRODUCE DEATH
ROBBERY HERE ONCE--BEFORE YOUR TIME
I DIDN'T KNOW THE WIRES WERE THERE I DID SAID THE COLONEL QUIETLY
THE CROWD INCREASING EACH MINUTE PRESSED AGAINST THE STILL LOCKED FRONT DOORS
EVER TAKE IT UP AND AS THE COLONEL QUESTIONED HE WAS LOOKING AT THE INDIAN TIMEPIECE UNDER A MAGNIFYING GLASS HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET
ONE WHALE OF A GOOD TIME
THE WOUNDS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN INFLICTED AT THE SAME TIME--ONE BY THE METAL STATUE OF A HUNTER FOUND ON THE FLOOR NEAR THE BODY THE OTHER BY A DAGGER-LIKE PAPER CUTTER ADMITTED TO BE OWNED BY HARRY KING BUT WHICH WITH THE BLADE BLOOD-STAINED WAS FOUND ON THE JEWELRY BENCH OF HER COUSIN JAMES DARCY
AND SO PASSED OUT AND BEYOND SINGA PHUT AND THE CHARGE OF MURDER HAVING BEEN QUASHED BY A HIGHER TRIBUNAL THAN THAT OF THE COUNTY COURT THE MATTER WAS SOON FORGOTTEN
GOT A RIGHT T COME IN I HAVE
THEN THE JUDGE WAS CONSULTED AND DARCY'S LAWYER WAS CALLED TO THE BENCH
HE BROUGHT ON SPOTTY MORGAN
YOU MAY BRING ME--ER--JUST A SMALL GLASS OF CLARET--A VERY SMALL ONE MR KETTRIDGE GAVE HIS ORDER AND THEN LOOKED RELIEVED
IT WAS AFTER THIS AND FOLLOWING SOME BUSY HOURS SPENT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY THAT THE DEFECTIVE SENT TO ONE OF HIS TRUSTED MEN IN NEW YORK THIS TELEGRAM
THEN I'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT THE FISHING AND I CAN BE ON HAND WITH MY FRIEND
I WONDER IF HE GETS INTO THE SEA OF NEW YORK IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO LAND HIM
LET HIM IN THE REPORTER ENTERED NODDED TO THE DETECTIVES GAVE A SHORT GLANCE AT THE BODY A LONGER ONE AT DARCY POKED MULLIGAN IN THE RIBS LIGHTED A CIGARETTE WHICH HE LET HANG FROM ONE LIP WHERE IT GYRATED IN ECCENTRIC CIRCLES AS HE MUMBLED
LET HIM SLEEP IT OFF AND HE GLANCED AT A HUDDLED FIGURE IN A CORNER CHAIR
THE FIRST EDITION AFTERNOON PAPERS HAD NOT LONG BEEN OUT WHEN THE DETECTIVE WHO HAD GONE TO HIS HOTEL AFTER AN EARLY MORNING VISIT TO THE JAIL WAS TELEPHONED TO BY MISS MASON
ARE YOU ALL READY COLONEL NOT QUITE
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE THAN I CAN LOOK AFTER PERSONALLY WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO HAVE KING KEPT IN SIGHT
DEPRESSED FRACTURE
THIS IS SIMPLY IN THE MATTER OF JUSTICE THE ENDS OF WHICH I KNOW YOU WISH TO SERVE AS I DO MYSELF
YOU LOOK CASEY HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN STEPPED CLOSER TO THE BODY
BUT I WANT TO DO MORE THAN THAT
BUT HAS ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED YES ANSWERED MR GRAFTON THERE HAS WHAT ASKED THE COLONEL
AND IT WILL BE SO I HEAR ONCE MORE THE OLDTIME AND RESPECTABLE RESORT IT ONCE WAS
THE COLONEL WONDERS XVII
ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND SHE HAD SENT FOR HIS SECOND COUSIN WHO AT THAT TIME WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF A WELL-KNOWN NEW YORK JEWELRY HOUSE AND HE AGREED TO COME TO HER
NO USE TRYING TO READ IZAAK NOW HE MURMURED
AND I SUPPOSE THEY'LL INDITE DARCY MUSED THE COLONEL
TIS THAT WELL TELL HIM SO AND GIVE HIM A HALF DOLLAR
DE COLONEL AIN'T ONE DAT KIN CARRY WATERMELONS ON BOF SHOULDERS RETURNING FROM HIS FISHING TRIP WITH THE ONE LONE SPECIMEN COLONEL ASHLEY HAVING ESCORTED AMY MASON TO HER AUTOMOBILE WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH SHAG
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE QUIET ROOM NEAR THE POLICE HEADQUARTER CELLS NEED NOT FORM PART OF THIS RECORD
I'VE RETIRED JACK LOOKED AT THE TRIM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE AND KEEN HANDSOME FACE NEITHER OF WHICH SHOWED THE OLD COLONEL'S AGE
YOU MEAN YOUR FATHER OH IT ISN'T ABOUT DAD
I TOOK PAINS TO ENQUIRE AND LEARNED THAT IT WAS NOT
WHY NOT HE ASKED AS THEY WALKED ON AND THE COLONEL AFFECTING A SLOWNESS IN GAIT HEARD THE WORDS
THEN I WAS OBLIGED TO ASK DARCY ABOUT IT SECRETLY OF COURSE AND WITHOUT HINTING AS TO THE OWNERSHIP
POOR GIRL SHE'S HAD A HARD TIME TOO
ARE WE IN
GIVE ME MY DIAMONDS TO WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT AND LET ME GO
THEN HE CONFRONTED THE MERCHANT
YOU'D BETTER COME WITH US
BUT NOW I'M IN THIS GAME I SUPPOSE I MIGHT AS WELL STICK
RELYING ON HIS SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE DISGUISE THE COLONEL MADE BOLD TO WALK WITHIN HEARING DISTANCE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN THE LATTER HAVING COME TO A STIFF HALT WHEN SHE SAW THE MAN ADVANCING TO MEET HER
I REMEMBER NOW SEEING YOU THERE THE DAY I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE DIAMOND CROSS AND DIDN'T FIND IT SAID THE DETECTIVE
THE LATEST YOUR HOOK BEING FASTENED THROUGH THE SKIN OF HIS LEG TOWARD THE UPPER PART OF IT
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE ARRIVE
IF I COULD ONLY KNOW AND HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND AS THOUGH TO THRUST THEM BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THE WALLS
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING PRETTY SOON THEY'LL SO FASTEN THIS CRIME ON JIMMIE DARCY THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE TANGLE SAID MR KETTRIDGE AS HE POKED A PAIR OF PLIERS AMONG THE PARTS OF THE WATCH
THE WATCH MURMURED DARCY
IT STRUCK HER ON THE HEAD INFLICTING WHAT WOULD HAVE PROVED A MORTAL BLOW EVEN WITHOUT THE KNIFE THRUST
WORD FROM SPOTTY XX
TELL HIM I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
LARCH IS GOING TO COME A CROPPER IF I'M ANY JUDGE WHAT DO YOU MEAN AGAIN THE COLONEL SEEMED PUZZLED
AND THAT BEHIND THE LAUGHTER IN HER EYES WAS THE SHADOW OF A SKELETON AT THE FEAST
SHE WAS PREPARED TOO IN CASE JIMMIE HAD BEEN FOUND GUILTY TO MAKE A STATEMENT IMPLICATING HER HUSBAND THOUGH UNDER THE LAW SHE COULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM IN A MURDER TRIAL WELL I'M GLAD IT'S ALL OVER COLONEL SAID MR MASON WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
THE MAN ON THE BOULEVARD DOES THE SAME THING AND PATCHES UP THE BREAK WITH A PEARL PENDANT
THE NEEDLE SHOT OUT PIERCED HIS TONGUE OR LIPS AND--THE DEADLY POISON DID THE REST BUT COLONEL--THIS--THIS IS THE WATCH MRS DARCY HAD IN HER HAND WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD YES WAS THE COOL RESPONSE
ME STUDY WATCHES
AS HE DID SO HE KNOCKED DOWN THE HEAVY STATUE OF THE HUNTER
FISHIN EXCLAIMED DONOVAN
AS MUCH SO AS I DO MY BOY THANK GOD FOR THAT
I WON'T TRUST THE TELEPHONE AND I'LL HAVE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE I LEAVE FOR THE WEST
EXCUSE ME HE MURMURED TO THE COLONEL
THE BLUECOAT ESCORTED THE COLONEL THROUGH THE CROWD INTO THE STORE
DAT'S IT YES SAH
FROM OUTSIDE IT LOOKED LIKE A CONVENTION OF UMBRELLAS
HIS LAST CASE CHAPTER I THE TICKING WATCH THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOUND WHICH BROKE THE INTENSE STILLNESS OF THE JEWELRY SHOP ON THAT FATEFUL APRIL MORNING
DON'T SAY YOU WON'T THE GIRL'S FACE HER BLUE EYES THE OUTSTRETCHED HANDS THE VERY POISE OF HER LITHE YOUNG BODY VOICED THE APPEAL
WELL KETTRIDGE CAN WAIT HE MURMURED AS HE CAREFULLY PUT AWAY THE WATCH THINKING WITH A SIGH OF REGRET OF POOR LITTLE CHET
CHAPTER III THE FISHERMAN FROM A LITTLE GREEN BOOK WHICH FROM THE EVIDENCE OF ITS WORN COVERS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MUCH READ THE TALL MILITARY-APPEARING OCCUPANT OF A MIDDLE SEAT IN THE PARLOR CAR OF THE EXPRESS TO COLCHESTER SCANNED AGAIN THIS PASSAGE
LARCH STOPPED THOSE OF THE CLOCKS THAT DIDN'T RUN DOWN AND STOP THEMSELVES
I KNOW BROKE IN AMY
MADAM I SINCERELY BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE TALL MAN WHO HAD CAUSED THE COMMOTION
BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
COLONEL ASHLEY PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM PAUSING NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN TO THE DASH OF RAIN AGAINST THE WINDOWS FOR THE STORM BEARING OUT ITS PROMISE OF THE MORNING HAD LASTED ALL DAY CHANGING FROM A DRIZZLE TO A DOWNPOUR AND FROM A DOWNPOUR TO A DRIZZLE WITH DISMAL REPETITION
HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN ABOUT IT
LARCH IS BEING PRESSED FOR CASH AND THAT MAY BE ONE REASON WHY HE'S SO THICK WITH HARRY KING
OF MEDIUM BUILD YET WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING LIVED MORE IN THE OPEN THAN DOES THE AVERAGE MAN HIS FACE HAD YET A STRANGE PALLOR NOT IN KEEPING WITH HIS ROBUST FRAME
BUT I DID NOT COME HERE TO DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH YOU BUT THE MATTER YOU SPOKE OF IN YOUR NOTE CUT IN THE WOMAN
OR DID IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STRANGE WIRES THAT LED TO THE WORK TABLE OF JAMES DARCY
ANYHOW I DON'T BELIEVE HE'D FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT
LOOK HERE YOU BLACK RASCAL
BUT I WAS SO ANXIOUS
IT'S ALL THE SAME ONLY DIFFERENT YES I SUPPOSE SO
THESE COINS WERE ONE OF HER HOBBIES AND HE BROUGHT FROM THE SAFE THE COLLECTION WHICH WAS OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO A NUMISMATIST
NOW ANOTHER MATTER
AND HERE'S HALF A DOLLAR SONNY
THE BEST DETECTIVE YES
LOOKS LIKE THE OLD LADY WAS MURDERED CASEY ANSWERED
BUT WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE ASKED
THOUGH IF YOU MEAN IT'S THE END I BEG TO DIFFER
COLONEL FURTHER WORDS WERE STOPPED BY THE DETECTIVE'S HAND PLACED SOFTLY QUICKLY AND SO DEXTEROUSLY AS HARDLY TO BE SEEN BY THOSE IN THE CROWD OVER THE MOUTH OF THE SPEAKER
IN POLICE HEADQUARTERS HE WAS KEPT IN SECLUSION EXCEPT AS TO HIS LAWYER AND EVENTS HAD FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER SO RAPIDLY THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO OTHER OPPORTUNITY UNTIL NOW THOUGH THE GIRL HAD SENT HIM A HASTY NOTE IN WHICH SHE SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS INNOCENT AND THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WAS BEING DONE FOR HIM
I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BUT WHAT IT DATED BACK TO THE TIME OF QUEEN ELIZABETH THOUGH IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED AND REMODELED SINCE THEN TO MAKE IT MORE UP TO DATE
ORIGINALLY I THINK THEY WERE FOR SOME SYSTEM OF BURGLAR ALARM INSTALLED BY MRS DARCY
WHAT'S UP ASKED CARROLL
YOU DID ME THE BIGGEST SERVICE ONE MAN CAN DO ANOTHER AND I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET IT SPOTTY NO I GUESS REMEMBERING IS YOUR LONG SUIT COLONEL WELL THAT'S ALL IN A DAY'S WORK
THE SHADOWS WERE LENGTHENING
THEN TOO VERY LITTLE NOISE MAY HAVE BEEN MADE
YOU WANT TO KNOW--WHAT--WHAT I DID YES
BUT HOW DID IT HAPPEN OH WELL THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A STORY TO IT AND DONOVAN'S VOICE SHOWED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ONLY THE WATCH TICKING IN HER HAND
SHOW YOU HER COLLECTION OF COINS
FOR THAT ALONE IS MISSING
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE QUITTING AND I NEVER WAS A QUITTER HE STRAIGHTENED UP TO HIS SOLDIERLY HEIGHT
HARK EXCLAIMED MULLIGAN AS HE AND DARCY CAME DOWNSTAIRS AFTER HAVING ROUSED SALLIE PAGE
OH IT'S HORRIBLE--HORRIBLE AND SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS
WHEN DID YOU LEAVE NEW YORK WELL I COME AWAY HOLD ON INTERRUPTED THE COLONEL
HERE YOU GO AND GIVE THAT NEWSBOY A QUARTER
MY NAME IS AMY MASON AND AH
THEN HE PLAYED A SAFETY SHOT BY ANSWERING
AND IF YOU ROVE FOR PERCH WITH A MINNOW THEN IT IS BEST TO BE ALIVE YOU STICKING YOUR HOOK THROUGH HIS BACK FIN OR A MINNOW WITH THE HOOK IN HIS UPPER LIP AND LETTING HIM SWIM UP AND DOWN ABOUT MID-WATER OR A LITTLE LOWER AND YOU STILL KEEPING HIM ABOUT THAT DEPTH WITH A CORK WHICH OUGHT TO BE A VERY LITTLE ONE
ALL IN GOOD TIME
ALL IN GOOD TIME
THAT'S THE LIFE SOFTLY VOICED THE COLONEL
IT WAS TO TALK OVER WHAT COURSE WAS BEST FOR HER TO PURSUE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE AND I WALKED OUT TOGETHER
THE CLERK TOLD ME YOU HAD COME TO THIS STREAM
AND THAT AARON GRAFTON HASN'T BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS FORCED INTO THIS THING I'M POSITIVE
THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR
I'M A FOOL EXPLODED THE COLONEL
SINGA PHUT XIV
YES A FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF--INDIAN I RECKON
WHAT OBJECT WOULD I HAVE AND HE TURNED AND PACED UP AND DOWN
ALL ABOUT YOUR QUARREL WITH MRS DARCY--I READ IN THE PAPERS YOU HAD ONE
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MIGHTY COMPLICATED CASE
YOU NEED ONE AS WELL AS A LAWYER
WE HAVE BOUGHT SOME ODD THINGS FROM HIM FOR OUR CUSTOMERS QUEER BEAD NECKLACES AND THE LIKE
THE FRANKER YOU ARE THE FEWER QUESTIONS I SHALL HAVE TO ASK
THIS IS NO TIME FOR A WIRE
IT'LL NEVER WORK THAT WAY--NEVER
BUT--I DON'T KNOW
WHERE'D YOU GET IT DEMANDED CARROLL
A MURDER MYSTERY RIGHT HERE IN TOWN
AND AS FOR HER FINDING FAULT WITH ME ABOUT MY ELECTRIC LATHE AND ABOUT THE MONEY SHE OWED ME--WELL THAT WAS A SORT OF PERIODIC DISAGREEMENT TELL THE COLONEL ALL ABOUT IT I WILL
MR MASON IN SPITE OF HIS WEALTH WAS A DEMOCRATIC MAN AND THOUGH HE KNEW AND AMY ALSO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED WEALTH AND POSITION BOTH WERE PASSED UP TO QUOTE THE STOCKMAN HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF A REAL LOVE MATCH
THIS YOUNG LADY AND HE NODDED TOWARD HIS COMPANION WHEN I TOLD HER PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER LET ME EXPLAIN TOM BROKE IN THE GIRL
NO MORE DETECTIVE CASES FOR ME
MAYBE NOT AND YET BUT IF THE COLONEL HAD ANY THOUGHTS REGARDING AARON GRAFTON HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF AS HE MADE READY TO GO OUT
AFTER THE MURDER OR LET US CALL IT KILLING FOR LARCH WITH HIS LAST BREATH PROTESTED HE NEVER MEANT IT--AFTER THAT WHICH CYNTHIA SEEMS TO HAVE GUESSED--SHE WAS EVEN MORE STRONG IN HER DETERMINATION NOT TO TAKE ANY OF HIS MONEY
HAVE WE ARRIVED
AND IF YOU LET ME HEAR A WHISPER OF ANYTHING BORDERING ON A CASE YOU AND I PART COMPANY--DO YOU HEAR I HEAHS YO COLONEL AND THE NEGRO SALUTED FOR THE DETECTIVE STILL CLUNG TO MANY OF HIS MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS
WONDER IF THERE'S A DECENT SPORTING GOODS STORE IN THIS PART OF TOWN
MRS DARCY HAPPENED TO COME DOWNSTAIRS AS HE ARRIVED AND KNOWING HIM WELL ADMITTED HIM THOUGH THE STORE HAD LONG BEEN CLOSED
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS THAT WE MUST TAKE ONE THING AT A TIME
DON'T THINK I AM TELLING YOU THIS OUT OF MERE JEALOUSY AARON GRAFTON WENT ON AND HIS MANNER WAS EARNEST
OH THAT'S MR GRAFTON MR GRAFTON
SO LONG
SOME CHEAPER CLOCKS ALARMS AMONG THEM ON THE SHELVES WHICH WERE USUALLY GOING SHOWED VARIOUS HOURS
SHALL WE SEND HIM ON SEND HIM ON
THE COLONEL MEANWHILE SAT BACK AND WAITED
WE CAN GET OUT THE BACK WAY AND AVOID THE CROWD FOR THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE JEWELRY STORE WAS STILL THRONGED IN SPITE OF THE EVER INCREASING RAIN
SOME ONE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT ON PEERING INTO THE STORE OF THE PROSTRATE FIGURE WITH THAT BLOTCH OF RED IN THE WHITE HAIR
I KNOW THE PLACE
WELL I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
SHE IS IN POMPEY YOU KNOW--WHERE SHE USED TO LIVE AS A GIRL AND WHERE I WELL I'M GOING TO SEE HER
BUT THE WIRES I USED FOR MY LATHE EXPERIMENTS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THOSE I'M SURE
YOU DO AS I TELL YOU
MAYBE THEY WERE STOLEN FROM THE JEWELRY STOCK NOT UNLESS MRS DARCY HAD SOME OF WHICH JAMES DARCY KNEW NOTHING WELL I SAW LARCH AT ONE TIME AND HARRY KING AT ANOTHER HAVE ONE OF THOSE WHITE TISSUE PAPER PACKAGES THAT JEWELERS KEEP DIAMONDS IN
KING CAME OF A GOOD FAMILY BUT HIS RELATIVES HAD CAST HIM OFF AFTER HIS MIDNIGHT MARRIAGE TO AN ACTRESS OF QUESTIONABLE MORALS WITH WHOM IT WAS NOT A FIRST OFFENSE AND HE NOW LIVED AFTER HIS OWN PECULIAR FASHION ON THE INCOME OF AN ESTATE SETTLED ON HIM IN HIS BETTER DAYS BY AN AUNT
I'M SICK OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS
AND IF THINGS GO RIGHT I MAY BE ABLE TO BRING HER AS MUCH WEALTH AS SHE HAS HERSELF HOW DO YOU MEAN IF THINGS GO RIGHT ASKED THE DETECTIVE
THE TROLLEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT FOR HIM HE SAID IN A WHISPER
DR WARREN SOON RESUMED HIS COAT ACCEPTED A CIGARETTE FROM DALEY SLIPPED INTO HIS STILL DAMP RAIN-GARMENT AND WAS SOON THROBBING DOWN THE STREET IN HIS AUTOMOBILE HAVING ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING TO BREAKFAST AND WOULD PERFORM THE AUTOPSY IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD
OH YES REPLIED DARCY
NOW BRACE UP I'M TRYING TO COLONEL WELL TRY HARDER
BUT IF HE DID AND GOT THE CROSS EVEN IF HE DIDN'T KILL MRS DARCY HOW IN THE WORLD COULD HE GET THE CROSS BACK TO HER WHEN THE POLICE TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM AND WHEN THE LAST I SAW OF IT IT WAS IN THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS SAFE
I WONDER HE SLIPPED THE LETTER QUICKLY INTO ANOTHER PLAIN ENVELOPE ONE OF A MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION OF PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND RETURNED IT TO THE BOY RETAINING THE COVERING HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TEAR OPEN FOR IT HAD BEEN SEALED
HE'S A MAN
IT'S NO GREAT SECRET
SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE STILL CARED FOR GRAFTON BUT DENIED ANY INTIMACY WITH HIM
I AM ENTITLED TO A BIT OF RECREATION AND OPENING HIS BOOK HE READ
NEW YORK PAPERS DON'T WANT THE NEW YORK PAPERS--ANY OF THEM THE MAN AFTER A SWIFT GLANCE FROM HIS GREEN-COVERED BOOK AGAIN LET HIS EYES SEEK ITS PAGES
KING AND DARCY WERE NOT AS YET FORMALLY ARRESTED BEING DETAINED MERELY AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS AS WITNESSES THOUGH THERE WAS NO QUESTION BUT THAT SUSPICION WAS CAST ON BOTH
WHAT KILLED THE POOR BRUTE UNLESS I'M VERY MUCH MISTAKEN THIS DID WAS THE ANSWER IN A LOW VOICE AND THE COLONEL WITH THE WATCH STILL WRAPPED CAREFULLY IN THE WAD OF TISSUE PAPER PLACED IT ON THE TABLE
THASH WHAT'LL SQUARE WIFELY WHEN I BEEN OUT--HIC--AL'NIGHT
THEN HE'S SORE BECAUSE SHE MADE SOME CRACKS ABOUT HIS GIRL--THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET ANY MAN RILED
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT SHE FELL BEHIND THE SHOWCASE AND MRS DARCY IN FRONT OF IT THE PLACE IS THE SAME WITH A MUTTERED EXCLAMATION THE COLONEL GOT TO HIS FEET AND ALSO LOOKED OUT FROM THE PRIVATE OFFICE
THE VERY IDEA HE MURMURED SPEAKING TO THE WINDOW AGAINST THE GLASS OF WHICH THE RAINDROPS WERE NOW DASHING IMPOTENTLY AND AS THOUGH ANGRY AT NOT BEING ADMITTED TO THE WARMTH AND LIGHT OF THE CAR
S'POSE THEY ALL RAN DOWN AT ONCE THEY COULDN'T DARCY ANSWERED I WOUND THE REGULATOR ONLY YESTERDAY AND HE POINTED TO THE TALL TIMEPIECE IN THE SHOW WINDOW--THE SOLEMN-TICKING CLOCK BY WHICH MANY PASSERSBY SET THEIR WATCHES
CHICAGO THEN
BUT JACK NOTICED THAT HIS CHIEF USED A WAD OF THE TISSUE PAPER WITH WHICH TO HANDLE THE TIMEPIECE WHICH WAS NO LONGER TICKING
DONOVAN TOO LOOKED ON IN STARTLED WONDER
OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE TO ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THE EASIER YOU DO THE BETTER FOR YOU
I WONDER
BUT HE WAS NEVER NOTICEABLY DRUNK
WHY YES I AM SURE
I HATE TO SAY IT--_MURDERER WHY COLONEL ASHLEY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DETECTIVES IN THE UNITED STATES--AT LEAST HE USED TO BE
DAT MR PHUT AIN'T KILLED
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GO ON THE STAND AND BETWEEN YOU AND ME OUR CASE AIN'T ANY TOO STRONG THAT'S RIGHT
DIAMONDS
IS THAT IT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY YES ADMITTED JACK AS HE PATTED CHET WHEN THE DOG THAT EVIDENTLY HAD MET HIM BEFORE SLID OVER TO HAVE HIS EARS PULLED
GOT TAKE IT HOME NOW
HE HAD JUST TIME TO SLIDE INTO HIS QUARTERS BY A REAR AND PRIVATE DOOR TO MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES IN HIS APPEARANCE AND BE CALMLY SITTING AT HIS DESK SMOKING A CIGAR WHEN HIS CLERK BROUGHT IN THE CARD OF AARON GRAFTON
HOW DARE YOU TRY TO GET ME INTERESTED IN A CASE WHEN I TOLD YOU IF YOU SO MUCH AS BREATHED ANYTHING ABOUT ONE I'D HORSEWHIP YOU
OH I WISH I'D NEVER MIXED UP IN THIS
AND AT THIS SPOT THE ROBUST MAN STARED LONGER THAN DID SOME OF THE OTHERS THE COLONEL THOUGHT
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WE CAN BE SURE OF AND THAT IS NO MATTER WHAT PART DARCY HAD IN THE MURDER--IF HE HAD ANY--BY MEANS OF THIS WATCH IN THE CASE OF MRS DARCY HE HAD NONE IN SHERE ALI'S CASE FOR DARCY WAS LOCKED UP WHEN THAT TRAGEDY OCCURRED THAT'S SO COLONEL
I AM STILL OPEN TO ARGUMENT AND CONVICTION AND THIS COIN WHICH YOU SAY BELONGED TO MRS DARCY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER DEATH AND WHICH NOW MAKES ITS APPEARANCE IN THE HANDS OF A DRUNKEN MAN WHO HAS BEEN UNDER SUSPICION MAKES CAUSE FOR QUESTION
HER NAME WAS MRS AMELIA DARCY AND HER HUSBAND AND MY FATHER WERE FIRST COUSINS
MRS DARCY'S MAID HAD GONE AWAY THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND WAS NOT EXPECTED IN UNTIL NOON
FRIEND OF MINE JUST TIPPED ME OFF WHERE I CAN GET HIM
THIS IS TO BE A SURPRISE SURE I KNOW AND WITH A PRECOCIOUS WINK THE LAD PASSED ON INTO THE EVER LENGTHENING SHADOWS
WE'RE TALKING TO YOU OF COURSE HARRY KING SEEMED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF SOBERING UP
I BELIEVE I WILL HE SAID SUDDENLY SLAPPING HIS HAND ON THE TABLE AT THE SOUND OF WHICH A WAITER HURRIED UP
PHUT--I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME--ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHERE ALI
NOTHING SEEMS TO BE GONE FROM THE CASES THOUGH I'D HAVE TO MAKE A BETTER SEARCH AND GO OVER THE INVENTORY TO MAKE CERTAIN WELL LET THAT GO FOR THE TIME
ENOUGH TO SAY THAT WHEN THEY LET SPOTTY GO STAGGERING BACK TO HIS DUNGEON A WRECK OF A MAN PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY FOR THE TIME BEING HE HAD NOT TOLD
YOU ARE A PRIVATE DETECTIVE YES MR GRAFTON WAS EVIDENTLY SPARRING FOR TIME
I'VE GOT EM HERE LOOK AND OPENING A CLOSET WHERE HE TEMPORARILY KEPT HIS COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE DONOVAN TOOK OUT A PAIR OF HEAVY BRONZE CANDLESTICKS IN THE FORM OF HOODED COBRAS
WE DON'T KNOW
YOU SEE YOU CAN'T GO TOO FAR WITH A MAN WHEN HE HAS SAVED YOUR LIFE BUT HE MAY KNOW ALL ABOUT IT POSSIBLY HOW ABOUT YOUNG DARCY THE COLONEL DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE
HIS HEAD WAS BOWED BUT AT TIMES HE RAISED IT TO LOOK OUT THROUGH THE BARRED DOOR
COLONEL ASHLEY FUMED FRETTED AND FIDGETED UNTIL HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF A SLEEPLESS NIGHT ON HIS WAY BACK IN THE TRAIN
YES HE CALLED AT THE COURT HOUSE AND BEGGED THAT IT BE GIVEN TO HIM
STRANGE AND FIRST AS HE GAZED AT THE PROSTRATE BODY--THE HORRID RED BLOTCH LIKE A GAY RIBBON IN THE WHITE HAIR--HE THOUGHT THE SMALL INSISTENT SOUND WHICH SEEMED TO FILL THE ROOM WAS THE BEATING OF HER HEART
IT HARDLY PENETRATED THE SKIN I SEE
I DON'T KNOW WAS THE MEASURED ANSWER
WHAT'S THE MATTER--'FRAID OF SOILING YOUR HANDS ASKED JACK WITH A LAUGH
WAS IT THE STRIKING OF THE CLOCK THAT AWAKENED YOU NO NOT EXACTLY
WE MUST COMBAT IT SOMEHOW PLEASE FIND A WAY COLONEL
THERE ARE THREE POSSIBLE MOTIVES IN DARCY'S CASE AND ONE IN KING'S
THIS BOY IS TOM TRACY
LET'S SEE NOW AND HE WENT ON WITH HIS PERUSAL OF THE PAPER
BUT I THINK I'D BETTER FOLLOW KING NOW
WHICH SHALL I TACKLE FIRST
NO IT'S AARON GRAFTON HE PROCEEDED WITH AN AIR OF RELIEF
HOW IS IT AROUND HERE
IT'S ALL RIGHT
JIMMIE BOY WHEN DAD LIKES A PERSON HE LIKES HIM I HOPE HIS DAUGHTER DOES THE SAME DON'T YOU KNOW--_JIMMIE BOY THE WARDEN THE DETECTIVE THE KEEPER AND THE LAWYER--ALL NOW SEEMED INTERESTED IN THAT PROSAIC CALENDAR
YOU AREN'T THE ONLY SUSPECT THOUGH
YES I'LL COME RIGHT AWAY
IT'S WORSE TANGLED THAN BEFORE MUSED THE OLD DETECTIVE
I SAID I WAS--_GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
OH PERHAPS I DID WRONG COMING THIS WAY--I'M SORRY IF I'VE SPOILED YOUR FISHING
I HEARD THREE ANYHOW I'M SURE OF THAT WELL PUT IT DOWN AS THREE SUGGESTED THONG
EVEN THAT FUNNY SPOTTY WAS ELIMINATED AS OUR DEAR OLD FISHERMAN CALLS IT WHEN HE EXPLAINED ABOUT THE DIAMOND CROSS
HE TURNED AND SAW THE BODY OF THE MURDERED WOMAN AS THE MEN FROM THE MORGUE STARTED OUT WITH IT
SO SPOTTY WILL SOON BE AT LIBERTY AGAIN I'M GLAD OF THAT
IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION OF COURSE IT IS
ANYTHING BUT THAT
SHE WON'T RUN AWAY AND HE NODDED TOWARD THE DEAD WOMAN
THE RUMORS FLOATED ABOUT A BIT SEEMED TO SINK AND THEN STARTED OFF AT FULL STEAM JUST BEFORE THE NEWS OF THE SEPARATION BECAME PUBLIC
BUT I AM ALL UPSET OVER THIS MATTER THEN SIR LET ME EASE YOUR MIND BY STATING THAT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME WILL BE IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AS FAR AS LIES IN MY POWER TO SO OBSERVE IT
NOR HAVE I THE LEAST SUSPICION WHO DID KILL HER
I WON'T EITHER,--THAT'S FLAT
HE'S HAD EM BEFORE SO WE KNEW THEY WAS ALL RIGHT WAS THAT ALL EVERY BLESSED THING THAT WAS IN THE PACKAGE
I HAD BEST BE FRANK WITH YOU
HAVE A TALK WITH SINGA PHUT
MY LAWYER ASKED DARCY
I WASN'T TOLD HE WAS CHARGED WITH MURDER HE WASN'T EXACTLY CHARGED WITH IT BUT WELL GO ON WHAT DID HE CONFESS TO JUST ROBBERY THAT'S ALL AND HE DIDN'T GET MUCH
ANYHOW LARCH HAS BEEN BOASTING TO KING THAT THERE'S TO BE A DIAMOND CROSS PRESENT
HERE SHAG HE CALLED
WHY COULDN'T HE KEEP OUT OF THIS
QUITE AN INTERESTING STUDY--WATCHES--DONOVAN
NO I HAVEN'T HE WAS HERE LOOKING FOR YOU A LITTLE WHILE AGO
WHO DID IT--WHEN--HOW I HAVEN'T THE LEAST IDEA REPLIED DARCY TURNING AWAY SO AS NOT TO SEE THE FACES NOW PRESSED AGAINST BOTH THE FRONT AND SIDE DOORS EACH BEING LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE
BUT I HAVE BEEN GATHERING UP SOME LOOSE ENDS AND I THINK I KNOW WHERE TO TIE THEM TOGETHER
CYNTHIA'S HUSBAND MAY ASK ABOUT IT AT ANY MOMENT AND WHAT EXCUSE CAN SHE GIVE IT IS RATHER A TICKLISH MATTER AGREED THE DETECTIVE
JACK YOUNG STUDIED THE DIAGRAM CAREFULLY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
BUT WHEN A MAN'S IN LOVE THE COLONEL SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND CHUCKLED GRIMLY
IT SEEMED THE RIGHT THING TO DO
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE SEEN EITHER HE MUSED
WE'LL GO AGAIN TO THAT PLACE WHERE MISS MASON FOUND ME
DARCY PROMISED TO FIX THE TIMEPIECE BUT NEGLECTED OR FORGOT TO DO IT LEAVING IT ON HIS TABLE
BUT HOW IN THE WORLD COULD SHE GET IT WHEN SPOTTY HAD IT AND THE POLICE THAT ARE HOLDING HIM HAVE THAT AND HE'S RESISTING EXTRADITION
IT WAS THEN THAT LARCH SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING POSSESSION OF THE VALUABLE STONES FOR HIS DEBTS WERE PRESSING AND THOUGH IT WAS SUSPECTED BY FEW HE NEEDED A LARGE SUM IN CASH
I WENT OUT TO HER FARM LAST NIGHT AND SHE WAS ALL BROKE UP IT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK TO ME WHEN I HEARD JIMMIE WAS UNDER ARREST SAID THE GIRL
SO IF I ASK ANYTHING IMPROPER PLEASE STOP ME
IT'S HIS PARTNER
MANY OF DARCY'S FRIENDS COULD NOT HELP BUT ADMIT THAT APPEARANCES WERE AGAINST HIM
BUT THE MAN EVIDENTLY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AWAY
SO YOU WALKED IN SECRET YES
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN AND WITH A MILITARY SALUTE THE COLONEL WENT OUT OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS
AND WHEN THE COLONEL RATHER UPSET HIMSELF BY WHAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO GO THROUGH STARTED BACK FOR COLCHESTER HE TOOK WITH HIM THE MEMORY OF SPOTTY'S RATHER SNEERING FACE AND THE ECHO OF HIS WORDS
ON THOSE GROUNDS I WENT BEFORE THE VICE CHANCELLOR PREPARED TO PROVE MY CASE BY COMPETENT WITNESSES
HE WAS AN EXPERT JEWELRY DESIGNER AND A SETTER OF PRECIOUS STONES
DARCY ANSWERED WITH SEEMING FRANKNESS THAT THE AMY IN QUESTION WAS MISS MASON DAUGHTER OF ADRIAN MASON WEALTHY STOCKMAN OF POMPEY A VILLAGE ABOUT TEN MILES FROM COLCHESTER
IT'S A RARE AND VALUABLE ONE I TELL YOU
THEY WERE INSISTENTLY KNOCKING AT THE SIDE DOOR HAVING FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD THAT WAS STILL THERE--LARGER THAN EVER MAINTAINING POSITIONS IN SPITE OF THE DRIPPING DRIVING DRIZZLING RAIN
GOD KNOWS I WOULDN'T WANT TO NAME ANY ONE EITHER MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE MYSELF MRS DARCY HAD NO ENEMIES NOT A ONE IN THE WORLD THAT I KNOW OF
TOM YOU'RE AN EXPRESS FOR THE TIME BEING WHISPERED THE COLONEL TO THE OPERATOR
HE HAD IT IN HIS MOUTH BUT HE GOT IT OUT
HE WAS WILLING--PERFORCE--THAT FOR THE TIME THE YOUNG MAN BE CONSIDERED GUILTY
NOT A WINDY GUSTY RAIN THAT MADE A MAN GLAD TO GET INDOORS NEAR A GENIAL FIRE WITH HIS PIPE AND A BOOK
I WISH THE STEAM WAS ON THE FOG FROM OUTSIDE SEEMED TO HAVE PENETRATED INTO THE JEWELRY SHOP
YOU HAVEN'T ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ONE HAVE YOU DARCY NOT A SOUL
LET ME IN
I WAS ON THE LEVEL IN SAVING YOU
BUT WHAT DID YOU DO NOTHING
I FORGOT YOU SAVED MY LIFE JUST NOW
DE COLONEL WAS ONE OF DE BIGGEST PRIVATE DETECTIVES IN DE UNITED STATES BOY
HE LEFT THE WATCH WITH MY COUSIN WHO TOLD ME TO REPAIR IT
I WAS SO HOPEFUL AND--NOW THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE OF HIS EMOTION
DEAD--MRS DARCY LOOKS THAT WAY SAID CARROLL IN COOL TONES
I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT OH YOU WON'T BE ALONE LONG OBSERVED CASEY
IT WAS ALMOST UPON HIM AND THE BIG SOLID FRONT TIRES WERE ABOUT TO CRUSH HIM IN SPITE OF THE FRANTIC EFFORTS OF THE DRIVER TO SWERVE HIS MACHINE TO ONE SIDE WHEN A SLIM FIGURE DASHED FROM THE CROWD ON THE SIDEWALK AND WITH AN INDISTINGUISHABLE CRY SEIZED THE COLONEL BY THE SHOULDERS FAIRLY DRAGGING HIM WITH A DESPERATE BURST OF STRENGTH FROM THE VERY PATH OF DEATH
SAY IF HE LETS OUT ANYTHING WE CAN USE AGAINST DARCY--YOU KNOW LEGITIMATE STUFF--PASS IT ON TO ME AND THONG WILL YOU
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT I HEAR AND THE TWO ENDED THEIR HALF-WHISPERED TALK AS COLONEL ASHLEY ENTERED POLICE HEADQUARTERS
AS FOR MISS MASON--I'D PREFER TO HAVE HER NAME LEFT OUT FALTERED THE YOUNG JEWELER
NOW LOOK HERE
NOW LOOK HERE
TRY IT ON HIM IF YOU HAVE ONE YES
THOUGHT WAS HARDLY MORE RAPID THAN THE COLONEL'S PERUSAL OF THE MISSIVE AND AS HE GAVE IT BACK TO THE BOY HE REMARKED
I REALIZE THIS IS A TEST OF FRIENDSHIP MISS MASON
MANY GOOD WISHES AND NOT A LITTLE TRADE HAD GONE TO HIM FROM HIS FORMER EMPLOYERS AND SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BOUGHT OF HIM WHEN HE WENT INTO BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF IN THE THRIVING CITY OF COLCHESTER
THE WATCH IS THE ONLY THING GOING IN THE WHOLE PLACE THE MILKMEN LOOKED QUICKLY AT DARCY
THEN YOU NEVER KNEW YOUR WIRES MIGHT BY THE CLOSING OF THE SWITCH ON YOUR TABLE SHOCK SOME ONE STANDING NEAR THE SHOW CASE I NEVER DREAMED OF IT
LARCH DECLARED HE NEVER MEANT TO KILL OR EVEN SERIOUSLY HURT MRS DARCY
I KNOWED IT WAS A CAMEL OR A ELEPHANT YES I SUPPOSE HE'S BUSY ON THAT
I HAVEN'T LOOKED BETTER TAKE A LOOK AROUND
ANOTHER PERIOD OF WAITING AND AGAIN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GIRL THOUGH THE COLONEL HAD NOT MANIFESTED ANY IMPATIENCE
I HAVE LOTS TO DO I'M SORRY
IF ANY ONE KNOWS OF YOUR COMING TO ME THEY WILL IMAGINE YOU WISH TO CONSULT ME ABOUT SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH YOUR STORE
LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SWITCH AND WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT I'LL LOOK TOO SAID ANOTHER VOICE IN THE DIMLY-LIGHTED STORE AND AS THE TWO TURNED IN STARTLED SURPRISE THEY SAW DETECTIVE CARROLL SMILING AT THEM
HE WAS BAILED OUT TO-DAY
THEN WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER GO AT YOU
WELL THEN GRAFTON MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT AFTER ALL
HE AND IKE MET OUT WEST AND TRIED TO SELL THE DIAMOND CROSS TO A FENCE AND GOT PINCHED AS SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS BY THE BULLS WHO WERE MAKING THEIR REGULAR ROUND OF THE PAWNSHOPS
I'M A DETECTIVE AND KNOWN AS SUCH NOW
HER HEAD'S CUT BAD THOUGH THERE'S NOT SO MUCH BLOOD AS I THOUGHT AT FIRST
HERE COMES A COP NOW
THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED-UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
LOOK AT THE DOG COLONEL EXCLAIMED JACK
THE PRISONER WENT BACK TO HIS LITTLE CELL WITH A HAPPIER LOOK ON HIS FACE THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT IT
THE DETECTIVES KNEW HIM FOR A SPENDTHRIFT WHO HAD BEEN IN MORE THAN ONE QUESTIONABLE ESCAPADE
AND IT WAS A FACT
SO YOU SEE JIMMIE BOY THINGS AREN'T SO BAD AS THEY SEEM THOUGH I HATE IT THAT YOU SHOULD BE IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE IT IS HORRIBLE AMY
EH SHAG YO DONE SAID IT EXCLAIMED THE COLORED MAN WITH A GRIN
THE PRISONER WOULD NOT BE RELEASED BECAUSE SPOTTY OR ANY ONE ELSE WAS SUSPECTED NOR WOULD HE BE ADMITTED TO BAIL
WAS THE QUARREL SPECIALLY BITTER NOT ANY MORE SO THAN OTHERS
HO
AS HE DID SO AND BROUGHT A PIECE OF MONEY UP INTO THE LIGHT A CURIOUS LOOK CAME OVER HIS FACE
IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY SAID DONOVAN
ANYHOW SHE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE WANTED TO ACCEPT ANY OF HIS MONEY AFTER HE HAD SPOILED HER LIFE
THE SHAME OF IT--THE DISGRACE
LOTS OF TIMES THE BIRDS IN HERE GET OFF THEIR FEED AND THE DEPUTY WARDEN MADE A COMPREHENSIVE GESTURE
THERE'S BEEN SOME NASTY BUSINESS AND YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DO FOR YOU'RE SO PICKLED NOW THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LOADING UP EVER SINCE LAST WEEK
SHUT UP ORDERED THE COLONEL WHO WAS BEGINNING TO PLAY HIS FISH
SHE HAD GONE TO HER APARTMENT BUT I DON'T HAVE TO PASS NEAR THAT TO GET TO MY ROOM
THERE'S AN END I HAVEN'T DEVELOPED VERY MUCH
THEN CAME A QUARREL AND THE KILLING WITH THE CANDLESTICK
WELL LIKE A CLOTH BRUSHING MY FACE MORE THAN LIKE A HAND--OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN A HAND WITH A GLOVE ON IT
I MAY HAVE OCCASION TO--TO GLANCE AT IT TO SEE WHAT TO-MORROW'S WEATHER IS GOING TO BE FOR FISHING YES SAH COLONEL AND WITH A CAREFULLY CONCEALED GRIN ON HIS FACE SHAG DREW THE BLACK-LETTERED PAPER FROM UNDER HIS WAISTCOAT AND LAID IT ON THE BED BESIDE THE COMPLETE ANGLER CHAPTER IV SPOTTY WELL NOW OBSERVED DETECTIVE THONG AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HIS VOICE SOUNDED REALLY CHEERFUL LET'S SEE WHERE WE'RE AT MR DARCY
SOFTLY HE EXCLAIMED
IT MAY HAVE BEEN I DREAMED IT BUT WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE INSISTED THONG
PLEASE GO ON AND IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING YOU KINDLY GET TO THE POINT I BEG YOUR PARDON
WELL DONOVAN SAID THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN YOUR FRIEND SAVED YOU THE TROUBLE OF CONVICTING HIM YEP
BUT I HAVEN'T SAID HE DID
HE MAY BE GUILTY BUT I DOUBT IT MY IDEA EXACTLY RETURNED THE COLONEL
ALL OF THIS JAMES DARCY SAW AND MORE
I CAME STRAIGHT UP AND WENT TO BED AT TEN O'CLOCK YOU SAY A LITTLE AFTER
IT MIGHT AND MIGHT NOT BUT THE BLOW ON HER HEAD--THE STAB WOUND IN HER SIDE BOTH COULD HAVE BEEN INFLICTED AFTER THE POISON WATCH KILLED HER--IF IT DID
I WENT TO BED ABOUT HALF PAST TEN AFTER WORKING AT MY TABLE DOWN HERE AWHILE WAS MRS DARCY IN BED THEN THONG ASKED
SO IN THE OPINION OF THE AUTHORITIES HE WAS NOT WORTH CONSIDERING FURTHER
YOU CAN GET IT FOR ME I YES
THERE WAS THE CLANG OF THE LOCK MECHANISM AND THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN
I CAME HERE TO REST AND FISH AND I'M GOING TO
THOUGH THE OLD WOUND STILL HURT I TRIED NOT TO LET HER SEE
THE BOY'S LEGS WERE SHORT AND VIGOROUS THE COLONEL'S LONG AND NO LESS MUSCULAR AND THANKS TO HIS DEVOTION TO WALTON WHICH HAD TAKEN HIM TRAMPING MANY MILES OVER HILLY TRAILS AS WELL AS ACROSS LEVEL MEADOWS THE OLD DETECTIVE WAS SOON ABLE TO OVERTAKE THE LAD AND AT A POINT IMPOSSIBLE OF OBSERVATION FROM THE STATION
YOU KNOW ME AND OH INDEEDY I DOES KNOW YO COLONEL
WHAT I DID
THE FRONT DOOR WAS LOCKED JUST AS IT IS NOW
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS--WHEN YOU'RE ABLE--AND IT'S A QUESTION OF HOLDING YOU HERE OR--TAKING YOU WITH US
THE GIRL'S HAGGARD LOOK TOLD PLAINLY OF HER DISTRESS
SHAG HE SUDDENLY CALLED
WALTON'S COMPLETE ANGLER AND LAUGHED SILENTLY THE WRINKLES OF HIS FACE AND AROUND HIS STEEL-BLUE EYES SENDING THE FROWN SCURRYING FOR SOME UNSEEN TRENCH
THE LADY'S GOING TO FAINT
SAY TO MR GRAFTON HE SAID TURNING TO THE CLERK THAT COLONEL ASHLEY WILL SEE HIM IN A MOMENT CHAPTER VIII THE DIAMOND CROSS COLONEL ASHLEY THERE WAS A FORMAL QUESTIONING NOTE IN THE MERCHANT'S VOICE
WHERE WERE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO ASKED CARROLL EASILY
I'LL SEE THIS MAN MYSELF HE CONTINUED SPEAKING TO THE MAN INTO WHOSE HANDS HE HAD PUT THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE AGENCY
PLEASE SHE WHISPERED
AND IF YOU WANT TO ARRANGE FOR MISS MASON TO VISIT HIM I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
HE CAME HERE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME AMY CONTINUED FOR HE DID NOT WANT TO BE BOTHERED WITH WORK
SO THAT IS AARON GRAFTON HE MUSED
BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THAT WATCH--THE ONE IN HER HAND
I GUESS THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT HARRY HAS DONE SINCE THAT NIGHT ABOUT A WEEK AGO WHEN I SAW HIM IN THE HOMESTEAD THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT I GUESS NOT COLONEL BUT WITH IT ALL I'M NOT MUCH NEARER THAN I WAS AT FIRST HOW ABOUT SPOTTY HE WON'T SAY A WORD YOU TRIED THE THIRD DEGREE ON HIM OF COURSE I--ER--I DID AND I DIDN'T THE COLONEL ANSWERED LAMELY
RAINING AND COLD
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT YOU MEAN ANYTHING I SAY MIGHT--MIGHT BE USED--AGAINST ME OH I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY EXACTLY
AMY'S APPEAL VI
BUT NOW THOSE WIRES RUN TO THE WORK BENCH THAT WAS USED BY JAMES DARCY TO HIS WORK BENCH THE MANAGER WAS OBVIOUSLY STARTLED
A HUNDRED PERSONS--YES TWO OR THREE HUNDRED--COME IN HERE EVERY DAY SPEND MONEY AND RECEIVE CHANGE
AND YOU CAN'T QUARREL WITH ME IF I TRY TO PROVE HIM INNOCENT SURE NOT COLONEL
THE COLONEL WAS SEATED IN HIS HOTEL ROOM HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF A LITTLE GREEN BOOK SMOKING AND READING
DAT'S IT
WHAT SORT
THEN SPOTTY AFTER A LIBATION SPOKE
IT WAS MRS DARCY--THE LADY WHO OWNED THIS JEWELRY STORE YOU KNOW
HE AND BLUE IKE CRACKED A CRIB HERE ONE NIGHT
HEAH I DONE BROUGHT YO A PAPER AND SHAG PULLED OUT AN EXTRA FROM UNDER HIS VEST WHERE HE HAD CAREFULLY KEPT IT CONCEALED UNTIL HE HAD MADE SURE OF HIS MASTER'S FRAME OF MIND
THE PLACE HAD BEEN OPENED FOR BUSINESS AGAIN AFTER THE FUNERAL AND CUSTOMERS CAME IN CAREFULLY AVOIDING THE PLACE WHERE A DARK STAIN COULD BE SEEN IN THE FLOOR--A STAIN MADE ALL THE MORE CONSPICUOUS BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT-COLORED BOARDS ABOUT IT
THE DEPOT WAS SO SMALL THAT ANY ONE LEAVING IT EVEN ON THE SIDE AWAY FROM THE TRACKS WOULD BE SEEN AS SOON AS HE HAD PASSED BEYOND THE SHADOWS
WHO IS THAT MAN ASKED COLONEL ASHLEY OF MR KETTRIDGE WHO HAD OFTEN COME TO THE SHOP DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASONS TO HELP MRS DARCY
SOME COINS FELL TO THE FLOOR AND ROLLED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TABLE WHEREAT SAT THE COLONEL AND MR KETTRIDGE
ONE OF EM NIPPED MY DOG FIERCE WHEN I GAVE HIM A CHANCE AT KILLING IT A DAY OR SO AGO I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT OUT
MEANWHILE CONTINUING HIS MUSING AND WITH A SATISFIED SMILE ON HIS FACE A SMILE THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT THE COLONEL WAS NOT SO VERY MUCH AVERSE TO GIVING OVER HIS FISHING FOR THE TIME BEING TO TAKE UP HIS PROFESSION ONCE MORE HE FOLLOWED AARON GRAFTON AS THE MERCHANT LEFT THE JEWELRY STORE
BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING-OUT FIRST
BUT GOTTA SQUARE WIFE SOMEHOW
OH OF COURSE AS A MATTER OF HUMANITY I WOULD NOT REFUSE TO HELP ANY ONE
NOW DON'T DISTURB ME AGAIN UNTIL WE GET TO COLCHESTER
YES IT'S A QUIET PLACE FOR A TALK MUSED THE COLONEL
HE MUST--COLONEL DON'T YOU SEE WHAT THIS MEANS YES MR KETTRIDGE I CAN VERY EASILY SEE WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN
OH IT'S IN HER HAND AND THE OTHER TWO LOOKED AND SAW CLASPED CLOSE IN THE PALM OF THE WOMAN LYING HUDDLED ON THE FLOOR A WATCH OF UNCOMMON DESIGN
I CAME HERE TO FISH AND READ IZAAK WALTON IN THE SHADE OF A BIG TREE ALONG SOME QUIET BROOK
WELL KEEP WATCH OF HARRY KING
CLEVELAND 1918 CONTENTS CHAPTER I
OF COURSE SAID THONG
I KNOW
DARCY HAD BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF MURDER BY THE POLICE CAPTAIN IN WHOSE PRECINCT THE HAPPENING OCCURRED AND NO BAIL BEING PERMISSIBLE IN MURDER CASES HE MUST PERFORCE REMAIN LOCKED UP UNTIL HIS INDICTMENT AND TRIAL
AH I THOUGHT SO AND AS THE COLONEL SPOKE CHET GAVE A SHUDDER FELL OVER ON HIS SIDE AND WITH A LONG SIGH LAY VERY STILL
UM YES
I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL HA LAUGHED DONOVAN SHORTLY
WELL WE WON'T GO INTO THAT OBSERVED THE COLONEL
CHEER UP
OH--OH SHE GASPED AND THEN SHE WENT INTO HYSTERICS ADDING TO THE EXCITEMENT AND GIVING MULLIGAN A BAD FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE FOUGHT TO KEEP THE CROWD FROM SURGING IN
FOR I REALLY THINK HE LOVED CYNTHIA ONCE
ITS CATALOGUE PRICE IS A THOUSAND
SHOULDN'T WONDER BUT WHAT IT HAD DONE THE TRICK
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME OF THE BEASTS IN THE TRAPS WE SET ABOUT
SOON A BLACK WAGON RATTLED UP TO THE JEWELRY STORE BRINGING FRESH ACQUISITIONS TO THE CROWD WHICH PERSISTED IN STAYING IN SPITE OF THE RAIN WHICH HAD NOW CHANGED FROM A DRIZZLE TO A MORE PRONOUNCED DOWNPOUR
I COULDN'T CATCH WHETHER KING HAD SOLD THEM OR LARCH
THE DOG HAS BEEN POISONED AND WITH A POISON SO DEADLY THAT EVEN SOME OF THE FOAM FROM HIS LIPS IN A TINY SCRATCH MIGHT CAUSE YOUR DEATH
HUM
DARCY MIGHT HAVE RESENTED BEING CALLED A FORTUNE HUNTER WHICH I SUPPOSE IS WHAT THE OLD LADY MEANT OR HE MAY HAVE BEEN STUNG TO SUDDEN PASSION BY THE HOLDING BACK OF THE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE TAUNTS ABOUT HIS LATHE
BUT MY DEAR MR KETTRIDGE LET US BE REASONABLE
THE NEEDLE WHICH UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS WAS SHOWN TO BE HOLLOW PROBABLY DRAWING THE POISON FROM SOME RECEPTACLE INSIDE THE CASE HAD SLIPPED BACK OUT OF SIGHT WHEN THE PRESSURE WAS REMOVED FROM THE RIM
I AM NOT ALTOGETHER UNFAMILIAR WITH THE COMPLETE ANGLER
A DIAMOND CROSS HAD BEEN FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION AND WAS BENT AND FLATTENED--CRUSHED BY SOME HEAVY FOOT--THOUGH ALL THE STONES WERE INTACT
THE LITTLE ANIMAL APPEARED TO HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING INTO HIS MOUTH WHICH BOTHERED HIM
GOT SOME FRIENDS IN TOWN OH NO SAH COLONEL
I HAVEN'T SAID LARCH DID IT
HELLO SOMEBODY
HE'S GOT ALL THE FAMILY HE NEEDS
A CHRONOMETER IN A SHOWCASE WAS FIVE HOURS AND SOME MINUTES AHEAD OF THAT
I GOT THAT OUT OF LARCH RATHER THAN HIS WIFE DID HE PAY IT NO
IF I HAD SEEN IN TIME THAT HE HAD THE WATCH I'D HAVE TRIED TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM
NOT REALLY YES HE DID SHAG
MAYBE NOT ASSENTED THE DOCTOR
CONSIDER ALSO THAT IT MAY BE HE CAME INTO POSSESSION OF THIS COIN HONESTLY HOW HE MAY HAVE RECEIVED IT IN CHANGE--HERE
DE COLONEL DON'T WANT NOTHIN BUT WALTON AN HIS ANGLE WORMS WHO'S WALTON
I HAVEN'T YET FOUND A MOTIVE FOR HIS KILLING OF HIS PARTNER--IF HE DID IT WHO ELSE COULD THERE MIGHT BE MANY
I NEVER SAW THE OLD LADY DEAD OR ALIVE AND I NEVER KNEW UNTIL JUST NOW WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT SHE'D EVER HAD THIS CROSS WHO GAVE IT TO YOU COLONEL DID YOU EVER KNOW ME TO SPLIT ON A PAL UNLESS HE SPLIT FIRST NO SPOTTY
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE USUAL THING AFTER A QUARREL POSSIBLY ADMITTED THE COLONEL
BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HER ATTITUDE ANY MORE THAN I CAN THE CHANGE THAT CAME OVER HIM
LEFT TO HIMSELF THE DETECTIVE LOOKED AT THE TIMEPIECE ON HIS TABLE NOW SILENT IN ITS TISSUE WRAPPING
THERE WAS ALSO KING'S TESTIMONY ABOUT WORDS OVER AMY THOUGH DARCY CONTENDED THAT THIS TALK WAS NOTHING MORE THAN HIS RELATIVE HAD INDULGED IN BEFORE REGARDING THE UNSUITABLENESS OF THE MATCH
YES I'M GLAD I HAD A HAND IN HELPING THEM THE YOUNG PEOPLE TURNING SAW THE TWO MEN AND AMY WAVED HER HAND
I AM FORTUNATE I BELIEVE IN SEEING COLONEL ASHLEY HIMSELF WHO I UNDERSTOOD HAD RETIRED OR PERHAPS IS ABOUT TO RETIRE
I THOUGHT MAYBE I MIGHT FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING HERE WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE SHOCK TO THE OLD SERVANT AND I DIDN'T MISS MY GUESS THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THE COLONEL OR MR KETTRIDGE TO SAY OR DO AND THEY REMAINED PASSIVE WHILE CARROLL TOOK HIS TIME LOOKING ABOUT
GET OUT
WHO IS HE AARON GRAFTON ONE OF COLCHESTER'S BEST AND WEALTHIEST CITIZENS
HOW ABOUT IT LOOK HERE SNARLED KING AND HIS VOICE RANG OUT WITH SUDDEN ENERGY
HE SAID MRS DARCY HAD NOT GIVEN IT TO HIM NOR ASKED HIM TO REPAIR IT
THERE THEY ALL THOUGHT THE MAN WAS MURDERED WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT HE HAD BEEN TAKEN WITH A HEART SPELL FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND A KNIFE HE HAD IN HIS HAND PIERCED HIS HEART THAT WASN'T YOUR CASE DOC OBSERVED CARROLL
WHAT IN THE WORLD FOR
I KNOWS YO AIN'T BUT YO SELLS BOOKS AN DAT'S WHUT'S DE TROUBLE
BOUGHT IT IN LI'L OLE N YORK LASH WEEK
THEY FLASHED ON THE WHITE STILL FACE AND THE GLEAMS SEEMED TO BE SWALLOWED UP IN THAT RED BLOTCH IN THE SNOWY HAIR
IT WOULD BE TOO BAD IF HE AND I WENT FISHING IN SEPARATE PLACES
SINGA PHUT BROUGHT IT IN TO HAVE IT FIXED IT IS TRUE BUT JIMMIE WAS A GREAT CHAP FOR PROMISING WORK AND THEN NOT HAVING IT READY ON TIME
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT SOMEWHAT TO THE SURPRISE OF THE COLONEL DARCY WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT
THOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED ON MY PART I MERELY SPOKE TO HIM
BUT IT WOULD NOT STOP ALL THE CLOCKS IN THE STORE--OR ALL THAT WERE GOING--AT DIFFERENT HOURS PERHAPS NOT
IT WAS A GOOD ATTEMPT
THERE WAS A SHUFFLING OF FEET AND A RATHER THICK AND UNSTEADY VOICE ASKED
I AM RINGING MARCY 5426 ANNOUNCED THE PLEASANT VOICE OF THE GIRL IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE
WELL IT HAPPENED THIS WAY EXPLAINED KETTRIDGE
HE STARED AT THE COIN
I'LL GET HIM OFF YET ARE YOU SURE COLONEL AND HER EYES WERE BRIGHT WITH UNSHED TEARS
HE WAS SPENDING MONEY FREELY BUT WAS KEEPING HIMSELF WELL IN HAND THOUGH A WAITER WAS AT HIS SIDE MORE OFTEN THAN AT THE SIDE OF ANY OF THE OTHERS
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRIC WIRES ON DARCY'S TABLE THEY ARE A PROBLEM I ADMIT
IT SQUEAKED MORE AS THOUGH UNEASY THAN IN PAIN IN ANOTHER MINUTE IT BEGAN TO RUN AROUND THE TIN FLOOR OF ITS PRISON AND THEN IT SUDDENLY STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS FELL OVER IN A LUMP AND WAS STILL
HE WANTED TO GET THE EARLY TRAIN OUT OF TOWN I SEE
IT WAS HIGH LARCH THE HOTEL KEEPER SO I UNDERSTAND
AND YOU'VE DONE WELL
IF YOU'LL HAVE THE GOODNESS SIR TO CALL A TAXI FOR ME AND COME WITH ME TO MY HOTEL I CAN THEN THE COLONEL CAME TO A HALTING AND SUDDEN PAUSE AS HE SAW THE FACE OF THE SLIM LITTLE MAN WHO HAD SAVED HIM--A FACE COVERED WITH FRECKLES WHICH WERE SPLOTCHED OVER THE CHEEKS THE TURNED-UP NOSE AND REACHING BACK TO THE WIDE-SET EARS
HE HAS BUILT IT UP FROM A SMALL ESTABLISHMENT
YES TO CALL THE COOK
TWICE I'VE TRIED TO READ MY BOOK UNDISTURBED AND THAT INSUFFERABLE TRAIN-BOY--THAT RASCAL WHO PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW AN ANT-FLY FROM A PIECE OF CHEESE--HAS BOTHERED ME WITH BOOKS AND PAPERS
PITY YOU DIDN'T GO ON THE STAGE
I'VE READ A LOT ABOUT YOU
ON THE FLOOR--RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE--BETWEEN THE SHOWCASES ANSWERED DARCY AND HE TOO WHISPERED
PETE DALEY'S STORY OF THE FINDING OF THE DEAD BODY OF THE OWNER OF THE JEWELRY STORE WAS A GRAPHIC BIT OF WORK
PUT WIFELY'S NAME ON--HER NAMESH PEARL--P-E-A-R-L AND HE SPELLED IT OUT LABORIOUSLY AND THICKLY
HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE PROTESTING AGAINST SOMETHING AND FINALLY THE PROSECUTOR WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE OPPOSITE THE ONE WHERE DARCY SAT WITH HIS COUNSEL
SHE RESISTED HIM IN THE DIMLY-LIGHTED AND DESERTED STORE AND HE CAUGHT UP THE PAPER-CUTTER DAGGER AND THREATENED HER
HE REFUSED TO NAME HER BUT SHE WAS NAMED LATER WHEN KING'S WIFE FILED A PETITION FOR A DIVORCE--NOT HER FIRST BY THE WAY
ALL WE WANT TO DO--PINKUS AND ME--IS TO LAY OUR HANDS ON THE DAGO THAT DONE IT AND GOT AWAY
I'M OFFICIALLY IN THE CASE AND I WASN'T BEFORE HAVING SENT THE SOMEWHAT CRYPTIC MESSAGE THE OLD DETECTIVE SAT IN HIS ROOM AND TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A LITTLE GREEN BOOK
FUNNY THING ABOUT THE CLOCKS ALL STOPPING THOUGH
THAT'S FUNNY TOO IF ANYTHING COULD BE FUNNY IN THAT PLACE OF DEATH THIS FACT MIGHT BE
IF YOU SO MUCH AS SCRATCH THE TIP OF EVEN MY OLDEST ONE I--I'LL--WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO TO YOU SHAG YES SAH I KNOWS COLONEL VERY WELL
DON'T TRY TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM ME DO YOU HEAR
JAMES DARCY HAD READ MUCH OF COLONEL ASHLEY'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN DETECTIVE WORK AND THE VERY MAGIC OF THE NAME WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE A PRISONER COURAGE
DEADER N A BURNED OUT CIGARETTE WELL OBSERVED DONOVAN DISPASSIONATELY THAT'S THE LIMIT I AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE COLONEL AND THERE WAS A CURIOUS LOOK ON HIS FACE
THERE WAS LESS OF A CROWD ABOUT NOW AND MULLIGAN DID NOT HAVE TO KEEP BACK A RUSH AS HE OPENED THE PORTAL
AH THERE'S A LINK I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO EXAMINE AS I'D LIKE TO
THERE BE ALSO THREE OR FOUR OTHER LITTLE FISH THAT I HAD ALMOST FORGOT THAT ARE ALL WITHOUT SCALES THE BOOK DROPPED FROM THE DETECTIVE'S HAND
DEED AN I WASN'T GOIN T LET YO HAB SO MUCH AS A SNIFT AT IT COLONEL
IT IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM I BELIEVE THOUGH MANY SUPPOSE HER HUSBAND GAVE IT TO HER FOR A WEDDING PRESENT
BUT PROFESSIONALLY--WELL REALLY I'M NOT HERE IN MY DETECTIVE ROLE
HE'S SORE AT HER BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE'S KEEPING BACK PART OF HIS COIN
SINGA PHUT GOT BACK HIS WATCH AFTER THE PROSECUTOR DECIDED HE DIDN'T NEED IT FOR EVIDENCE
I'LL LOCK THE DOOR AND KEEP THE CROWD OUT
I AM NOT AT ALL DISSATISFIED AND MR GRAFTON HELD UP A PROTESTING HAND
HIS CLERK HANDED HIM A TELEGRAM
BUT IF IT WAS A BURGLAR IT'S FUNNY YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY NOISE--LIKE A FALL OR SOMETHING
THE COLONEL GLANCED AT SHAG AND THEN DRAWING FROM AN INNER POCKET THE LITTLE GREEN BOOK READ
WITH EVENING COMING ON IT WAS ALMOST SURE TO BE DESERTED THOUGH LATER IF THERE WAS A MOON MURMURING VOICES WOULD MINGLE WITH THE ECLIPSE OF THE SWIRLING WATERS IN THE GULLY BELOW
I WILL
I'LL GET EM
THE COLONEL GRIMY AND MUDDY WAS SET ON HIS FEET BY HIS RESCUER AND SEVERAL MEN GATHERED ABOUT
I THINK OBSERVED THE COLONEL TO HIMSELF AS HE WATCHED THE BOY MAKING HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE STATION THAT I'LL MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OLD SAYING AND FOLLOW THE WOMAN INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR HER SINCE I KNOW WHERE SHE IS ALREADY BACK THEN TO THE PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE WENT THE FISHERMAN AND REACHING THE HOUSE WHERE THE BOY HAD LEFT THE NOTE TAKING THEREFROM ITS ANSWER COLONEL ASHLEY WAITED WITH ALL THE PATIENCE THAT MIGHT CHARACTERIZE A WAITING BESIDE SOME FISHING STREAM
THERE'S A GENTLEMAN DOWNSTAIRS ASKING FOR YOU CAME THE WORD IN RESPONSE TO HIS ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS
SHAG YOU BLACK RASCAL CRIED THE COLONEL
KEDGE HAS THAT BANK CASE TO LOOK AFTER
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS
I THINK I'LL GO TO SEE HIM ALL RIGHT
WHERE'S YOUR PHONE
JIMMIE AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU I WONDERED WHY MY EARS BURNED AND THE OLD DETECTIVE LAUGHED
TELL HIM TO COME IN SAID THE COLONEL MORE AND MORE SURPRISED AT THE TURN AFFAIRS WERE TAKING
ANYTHING ELSE COLONEL ASKED SHAG WHEN HE HAD LAID OUT HIS MASTER'S CLOTHES AND WAS PREPARING TO GO TO HIS OWN APARTMENT IN AN ANNEX TO THE HOTEL
OH THERE'LL BE A CHARGE MADE BEFORE THEN ALL RIGHT SAID THONG EASILY WHEN THE LEGAL SHYSTER HAD WITH THREATENING FINGER UNDER THE DETECTIVE'S NOSE MADE MUCH OF THIS POINT
DO YOU SUPPOSE ASKED THE JEWELER THAT HARRY KING COULD HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CASE OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT EVEN SO WE CAN EASILY MAKE SURE OF HIM AND ARREST HIM WHEN WE WANT HIM
WE WENT IN SECRET FOR THERE ARE GOSSIPING AND WAGGING TONGUES IN COLCHESTER AS ELSEWHERE AND IF I THE LEADING MERCHANT IN THE TOWN WAS SEEN TO BE ALONE WITH PRETTY CYNTHIA LARCH WHOSE HUSBAND WAS A FRIEND OF JUDGES AND POLITICIANS WHO FREQUENT HIS HOTEL THERE WOULD BE TALK LITTLE SHORT OF SCANDAL I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU
SINGA PHUT HAD NO REASON FOR WISHING HARM TO DARCY
HE WAS NOW FOLLOWING GRAFTON WITHOUT THE LATTER BEING AWARE OF IT--NO VERY DIFFICULT MATTER IN A CITY THE SIZE OF COLCHESTER AND ON ONE OF ITS MAIN STREETS
CHAPTER XIX WORD FROM SPOTTY WELL REMARKED JACK YOUNG AS HE CRITICALLY OBSERVED THE SMOKE FROM HIS CIGAR CURLING UPWARD TOWARD THE CEILING IN THE COLONEL'S HOTEL ROOM WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US ALL RIGHT I SHOULD SAY SO AGREED MR KETTRIDGE WHO SAT BEFORE A LITTLE TABLE ON TOP OF WHICH WERE STREWED PARTS OF A WATCH
I'M ALMOST RESOLVED TO GIVE IT UP
THE GATHERING OF CONGENIAL SPIRITS WHO KNEW THEY WOULD BE UNDISTURBED BY A ROISTERING ELEMENT GREW LESS FREQUENT IN THE GRILL AND TUDOR ROOMS
SO HELP ME I NEVER LAID EYES ON THE OLD LADY--DEAD OR ALIVE
COLONEL ASHLEY LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WATCH WAS A CURIOSITY HAVING TO DO WITH SOME CASE HE WAS INVESTIGATING
I MUST NOT NEGLECT THE SMALLEST CLEW IN A CASE LIKE THIS
THESE RUBBER HEELS DON'T MAKE MUCH NOISE THEY DON'T INDEED WHEN YOU WALK ON THEM AND NOT ON THE SOLES OBSERVED THE COLONEL GRIMLY
CATCH HER YES SAH COLONEL NO
A LITTLE THUD AMONG THE BUSHES TOLD WHERE THE WEAPON HAD FALLEN ITS BULLET CUTTING THE TREE BRANCHES OVERHEAD
BY THE WAY BASSET IS HERE
HE WAS TAKING HIS FISHING BY A SORT OF CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL METHOD IT WILL BE OBSERVED
I TRIED ON THE TRAIN TO SELL YOU A DETECTIVE BOOK NOT KNOWING WHO YOU WAS
SVALUABLE TOO
NOW SPOTTY I'M A PLAIN-SPOKEN MAN WHEN THERE'S OCCASION FOR IT AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES I GUESS
THIS SET IN MOTION THE DEATH-DEALING MECHANISM AND HER HAND MAY HAVE BEEN PUNCTURED WITH THE POISON BUT EVEN THEN PUT IN YOUNG AS HE PUFFED OUT ANOTHER CLOUD OF SMOKE IF THE POISON FROM THE WATCH KILLED HER WHY WOULD ANY ONE STRIKE HER ON THE HEAD AND STAB HER THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED JUST AFTER HER HAND WAS PUNCTURED BY THE NEEDLE OF THE WATCH SAID THE DETECTIVE AND BEFORE THE POISON HAD TIME TO WORK
AND--THANKS SPOTTY STILL TALKING THROUGH THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH GAVE A QUICK GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM AND SLID OUT OF A SIDE DOOR LIKE AN EEL DISAPPEARING INTO THE RAIN AND MIST
I AM HE SAID AND THE PEACEFUL JOYOUS LOOK THAT HAD COME INTO HIS EYES WHEN HE HAD LANDED HIS FISH GAVE WAY TO A HARD AND PROFESSIONAL STARE
A WAITER HOVERING NEAR BY CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HIS EYE AND BROUGHT THE LIQUOR
EARLY PAPER BOYS SLUNK ALONG THE SLIPPERY STREETS TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR LIMP WARES FROM BECOMING MERE BLOTTERS
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK COME ON BACK
OH NO COLONEL ASHLEY SO AMY MASON MET THE TEST
THAT WILL MAKE DARCY FEEL BETTER
TELL ME FRANKLY SHE BEGGED DOESN'T THIS MAKE IT LOOK A LITTLE WORSE FOR MR DARCY YES MISS MASON IT DOES
UNDER THE LAW A FORMAL CHARGE MUST BE MADE AGAINST THEM WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND UNLESS THIS WAS DONE KING'S LAWYER THREATENED TO BRING HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS FOR HIS CLIENT
AS FOR YOU IF SPOTTY OH THAT SUITS ME AS WELL AS ANY OTHER
MAYBE HE CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING DOCTOR WARREN RUBBING HIS HANDS TO GET RID OF THE LINT FROM THE WARDEN'S TOWEL CAME ALONG SETTLING HIMSELF INTO HIS COAT WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE BETTER TO EXAMINE THE BODY OF THE EAST INDIAN
SAME IDEA HARRY KING HAD YOU KNOW BUT A LITTLE HIGHER CLASS THAT'S ALL
I LEAVE THAT TO THE GUM-SHOE MEN
I'LL NOT LOOK AT ANOTHER ISSUE
I HAD ANOTHER ONE PUT IN AND I SUPPOSED THEY HAD RIPPED OUT THE OLD WIRES
TOO MANY KNOW ME HERE SO I KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AS MUCH AS I COULD SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND QUICKLY
I NEVER OUGHT TO HAVE GONE INTO IT
FOR THAT IS WHAT IT WAS
WELL HURRY ALONG SONNY AND HERE'S AN EXTRA QUARTER FOR YOU I'LL FOLLOW YOU AND YOU CAN LET ME SEE THE ANSWER BEFORE YOU GO BACK TO MY FRIEND
NOW JACK I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HARRY KING HE NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT WAS THE RESPONSE
BUT OF COURSE SHE MIGHT HAVE HEARD A NOISE IF YOU DIDN'T AND SHE MIGHT HAVE COME DOWN TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
WHAT'S ALL THIS I HEAR ASKED THE DETECTIVE
YES I'LL SEND FOR KEDGE
SO IF DONOVAN THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT THE WATCH HE SAID NOTHING
BUT THIS TIME THE INSTRUMENT WAS MUTE AND THE COLONEL HAD SOON ASKED CENTRAL FOR THE TELEPHONE IN THE APARTMENTS NOW OCCUPIED BY MR KETTRIDGE
I WISH THERE CAME ANOTHER KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND A VOICE ASKED
THE WATCH OF DEATH CHAPTER XI NO ALIMONY SHAG EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL
SO I MADE UP MY MIND TO GET UP EARLY AND ATTEND TO IT
LANGFORD LARCH TOLD EVERYTHING IN THE BRIEF TIME LEFT HIM BETWEEN HIS FATAL LEAP AND THE PASSING OF HIS SOUL TO A HIGHER JUDGMENT THAN THAT OF THE COUNTY COURTS
YO SUAH DID AND SO MUCH AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND ALL THE WORLD WAS COLONEL ROBERT LEE ASHLEY JUST THEN THAT WHEN THE CRACKLING OF THE UNDERBRUSH BEHIND HIM A MOMENT LATER GAVE NOTICE THAT SOME ONE WAS APPROACHING THERE WAS EVEN A SMILE ON HIS FACE THOUGH USUALLY HE COULD NOT BEAR TO BE INTRUDED UPON WHEN FISHING
HE DIDN'T SWALLOW IT
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE THIRD DAY OF HIS SURVEILLANCE DURING WHICH PASSAGE OF TIME HE HAD WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR A MESSAGE FROM NEW YORK WITHOUT GETTING IT THAT THE COLONEL FELT HIS PATIENCE WAS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED
HERE YOU KEEP THIS COIN FOR THE DETECTIVE HAD OFFERED IT TO HIS COMPANION
I KNOW CYNTHIA HAD THE CROSS BEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED YOU CALL HER CYNTHIA I HAVE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN I SEE
MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME A HINT THAT WOULD CLEAR UP SOME OF THE DOUBT I HAVE REGARDING DARCY ALL RIGHT COLONEL I'LL COME
NO PARTICULAR PURCHASE MADE BY GRAFTON STANDS OUT IN MY MIND HOWEVER HOW ABOUT HAVING HIS WATCH REPAIRED I'D REMEMBER I THINK IF I HAD FIXED HIS WATCH
I HAD TO CALL EM UP ONCE WHEN I HAD A HORSE STOLE
GUN ASKED THONG WHO WAS MAKING A QUICK VISUAL INVENTORY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE PLACE
WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH RABBIT THANK YOU NO
NOW AND THEN HE MANAGED TO GET LARGER ADVANCES THAN THE STIPULATED SUM FROM A RASCALLY LAWYER WHO TOOK A CHANCE OF REIMBURSING HIMSELF A HUNDRED PER CENT
YOU AIN'T AND SPOTTY DREW AWAY FROM THE ARRAY OF GLASSES AND BOTTLES SO SUDDENLY THAT HE OVERTURNED A TUMBLER WITH ITS TINKLING CHUNK OF ICE
IS ANYTHING GONE I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN--HE WAS THIS SIDE OF THIRTY
WHEN COLONEL ASHLEY RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL FROM THE ELECTRICIAN'S HE FOUND AMY MASON WAITING FOR HIM
IS THIS COLCHESTER SHE ASKED SITTING UP AND LOOKING ABOUT IN STARTLED SURPRISE HER BONNET VERY MUCH ASKEW
THERE'S BEEN A MURDER
YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH MY WORK ON YOUR BEHALF
NOW SAH COLONEL LUNCH AM SERVED
THERE WAS LITTLE THAT WAS TANGIBLE--MERE GOSSIP--A HINT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH SOME ONE ELSE THOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH MONEY AS HAD LARCH
BUT WE'LL GET HIM THEN YOU THINK HE DID IT SURE HE DID
MAH GOOD LAND OF MASSY EJACULATED THE NEGRO
DONOVAN REACHED UNDER THE COLONEL'S ARM AND BROKE OPEN ONE OF THE WHOLE CIGARETTES
IT WAS SO SLIGHT THAT I AND MY ASSISTANT ONLY GAVE IT A PASSING GLANCE
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THEN DEMANDED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE
I HAVE A CASE I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE UP FOR ME WENT ON THE MERCHANT
AND HER FATHER TOO--HE'S WITH YOU FROM THE DROP OF THE FLAG HE TOLD ME
THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CURRENT IN THEM
BAH
HE AND AMY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE CHILDHOOD AND WHEN SMALL HAD LIVED NEAR EACH OTHER
BUT IT'S MY LAST CASE
LET EM IN SURE ASSENTED THONG
WELL I'LL SOON FINISH HIM
FOLLOW THAT TAXI THE COLONEL ORDERED THE DRIVER OF HIS MACHINE AS IT ROLLED OUT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION JUST A FEW LENGTHS BEHIND THE ONE IN WHICH GRAFTON RODE
I THINK MY ONE BEST BET IS TO FOLLOW YOU WHEN YOU GO TO SEE MISS CYNTHIA BUT BEFORE THE COLONEL COULD LEAVE THE ROOM THERE SOUNDED THE INSISTENT RINGING OF HIS TELEPHONE BELL
BUT WHAT I CAN'T SAY
GRADUALLY THERE HAD COME ABOUT LITTLE WHISPERS THAT CYNTHIA LARCH HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN HER MARRIAGE
THAT'S BETTER THOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SAID THE DETECTIVE
PLOT TO A COMBINED ATTACK BY NEW YORK GUNMEN BUT WHAT WAS IT WELL ONE OF OUR CLERKS MISS BRILL WAS WAITING ON A CUSTOMER AT ONE OF THE SILVER SHOWCASES
OUT TOWARD POMPEY YOU SAY
THE SIDE DOOR WAS OPEN AND I WALKED IN
THEN AS IF IN DESPERATION HE TURNED TO THE SHRINKING NEGRO AND WENT ON
NO SAH
BUT HER FOLKS MADE TROUBLE
I THOUGHT CYNTHIA COULD THEN WEAR IT AGAIN WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING IT HAD EVER BEEN OUT OF HER POSSESSION
HAVE A DRINK NO THANK YOU WITH A FRIENDLY WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE COLONEL KING SLIPPED THE HALF DOLLAR INTO HIS POCKET WITH OTHER LOOSE CHANGE AND TURNED TO THE GLASS THAT AWAITED HIM
I LOVED HER DEEPLY AND SINCERELY
I HAVE WORKED FOR HER ABOUT SEVEN YEARS--EVER SINCE JUST AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED
WHERE IS IT YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN HERE AND HAVE THE CALL TRANSFERRED FROM OUR CENTRAL AND THE MAN OPENED THE DOOR OF A SMALL BOOTH
BUT NOW YOU'RE FREE
BUT TAKE THIS FOR A RULE COME IN INVITED THE COLONEL THINKING IT MIGHT BE SHAG WHO SOMETIMES FOR THE LESSER DISTURBANCE OF HIS MASTER'S THOUGHTS OR READING THUS ANNOUNCED HIMSELF
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SHAG
GIVE ME SOME INKLING OF WHAT YOU WANT
MR GRAFTON IS GOING TO SELL OUT HIS BUSINESS
I KNEW SOME WERE THERE FOR WE DID HAVE AN ANTIQUATED BURGLAR ALARM SYSTEM WHEN I FIRST CAME TO WORK FOR MY COUSIN
WHEN HARRY KING SHOULD COME TO THE END OF HIS ROPE--A TIME WHICH SEEMED NOT FAR OFF IF THE PRESENT WERE ANY INDICATION
SO THAT'S WHO HE IS
I GUESS I UNDERSTAND SAID THE COLONEL WITH A LAUGH
BUT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF BY HER FATHER
MANY AN MANY A TIME I'SE DONE HEAH YO SAY YO'S GOIN OUT T HUNT DIS MAN OR DAT WOMAN VERY GOOD SHAG
NOW AS I SAID YOU SAVED MY LIFE
OH I'LL SEND YOU ONE OF MY BEST MEN WAS THE ANSWER
SALLIE PAGE
GOOD-BYE AN HOUR LATER THE MAN HE HAD SENT WEST TO BRING ON SPOTTY MORGAN ENTERED HIS ROOM
THEN TURNING TO THE STILL WAITING SHAG HE WENT ON
SURE THASH MINE
WHAT WATCH THE ONE--IN HER HAND OH I SEE
NOT BEING A PUBLIC OFFICIAL I'M NOT BOUND TO USE WHAT KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICIONS I HAVE REGARDING THIS MATTER AND I'M NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED--AS YET
WHERE ARE YOU IT WAS VERY DARK NOW UNDER THE TREES
DIAMONDS WRAPPED IN THOSE LITTLE SQUARES OF WHITE PAPER THAT JEWELERS USE
I HAPPENED TO BE IN TOWN SHOPPING SHE SAID AND THE AGITATION WAS PLAINLY AUDIBLE IN HER VOICE WHEN I SAW THIS TERRIBLE THING ABOUT MR DARCY'S WIRES AND POOR SALLIE
THEN A QUEER LOOK CAME OVER HIS FACE AS HE MURMURED
COLONEL ASHLEY WITH SHAG AT THE PROPER DISTANCE IN THE BACKGROUND AND WITH JAY KENNETH AS HIS INVITED GUEST WAS SITTING ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE STREAM FISHING
THAT'S WHAT I SUSPECT
HE WAS LOCKED UP WITH THE REST TO-NIGHT AND WE GOT SORT OF QUIET AND COMFORTABLE HERE AND I WAS HAVING A GAME OF PINOCHLE WITH TOM DOYLE WHEN ONE OF OUR BOARDERS IN MURDERERS ROW LETS OUT A HOWL
HE DONE IT I TELL YOU MAYBE HALF ASSENTED THE COLONEL
IT'LL BE EASY ON A MERE THEFT CHARGE
NONSENSE
NONSENSE
THE DAGO WAS ALL RIGHT TO-DAY EXCEPT HE SEEMED A LITTLE GLUMMER THAN USUAL
IF I THOUGHT HE HAD DONE IT I WOULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS CASE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SWEET JOB PROVING HE DIDN'T DO IT LAUGHED THE OFFICER
OR WAS IT WALTON
IF IT WAS HE'D HAVE BEEN AT THE PLACE BEFORE WHEN THE EVIDENCES OF THE CRIME WERE THERE TO BE STARED AT BY THOSE WHO CARE FOR SUCH THINGS
HE HAS NOT LIVED HERE VERY LONG BUT I KNEW HIM IN NEW YORK
IT NEEDED A NEW CASE-SPRING AND SOME OF THE SCREWS WERE LOOSE HOW DID MRS DARCY COME TO HAVE THE WATCH IN HER HAND CARROLL DEMANDED
WAIT A MOMENT THE COLONEL STEPPED INTO A CLOSET
GOING A LITTLE HIGHER UP THE SCALE IN POPULATION HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A HOTEL PROPRIETOR
HE MAY GET AWAY FROM US IF WE DON'T DRUNK AS HE IS NO THERE'S TIME ENOUGH FOR THAT OBJECTED THE COLONEL
THIS IS FIERCE HE MURMURED
MORTIMER DARCY HAD BEEN A DIAMOND SALESMAN FOR A LARGE NEW YORK HOUSE IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND HAD COME TO BE AN EXPERT IN PRECIOUS STONES
OVER ON THE WATCH REPAIR TABLE DARCY GASPED
I PASSED HIS PLACE A WHILE AGO
THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN WHO WAS ALSO THE CORONER HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
HE'LL TELL YOU THE YARN--IT'LL SURPRISE YOU--I HAVEN'T TIME
SOON AS I READ ABOUT CARROLL AND THONG BEING ON THE CASE I KNEW IT WOULD TAKE A FLY ONE TO PUT ANYTHING OVER ON THEM
I THINK SO--YES ANSWERED THE JEWELER
THEY TALKED OF MUCH INCLUDING THE MURDER AND THE COLONEL WAS MORE THAN PLEASED TO FIND THAT THE JEWELER HAD NO VERY STRONG SUSPICION AGAINST YOUNG DARCY
I GENERALLY FIND HIM WITH YOU WHEN HE ISN'T IN MY ROOM AND MR BLAND ENTERED THROUGH THE OPENED DOOR AND FROM THE FIGURES OF THE DETECTIVE AND HIS HELPER THE EYES OF CHET'S OWNER WENT TO THAT OF THE MOTIONLESS DOG
LARCH IS GOING TO PAY HIS WIFE A VISIT--GOING TO CALL ON HER AT HER FATHER'S PLACE IN POMPEY
IT WAS ONE OF THE QUALIFICATIONS THE DETECTIVE SNAPPED THE BOOK SHUT AND TOSSED IT ON THE BED
ALSO WALTON IS HE A JEWELER LORD NO
FOR I WAS FORCED INTO IT GRUMBLED THE OLD DETECTIVE
FOOLISHNESS THE WOMAN QUESTIONED
AS HE DID SO A LOOK ALMOST OF FRIGHT CAME OVER HIS FACE
BUT SHE WENT AWAY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND WON'T BE BACK UNTIL ABOUT NOON
AND HAVING DONE THAT AND HAVING HAD A TALK WITH DARCY AT THE JAIL AS WELL AS A CONSULTATION WITH THE LAWYER HAVING VISITED HARRY KING AND SEEN SINGA PHUT THE DETECTIVE PAID ANOTHER VISIT TO THE JEWELRY SHOP
BUT WHEN THE JUDGE TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE BENCH AND THE CRIERS HAD PROCLAIMED SILENCE THERE WAS A WHISPERED CONFERENCE AMONG THE PROSECUTOR AND HIS DETECTIVES IN WHICH CARROLL AND THONG TOOK PART
I HAD TO SPEAK A LITTLE LOUD FOR MY COUSIN WAS GETTING A TRIFLE DEAF AND AFTER THE QUARREL YOU WENT TO BED YES AND YOU DIDN'T SEE YOUR COUSIN AGAIN UNTIL--WHEN AND CARROLL LOOKED DARCY STRAIGHT IN THE EYES
I WAS ON FOR A VISIT
I'LL GO AND COME AS I PLEASE AND SO HE WENT SEEMINGLY RATHER IDLY ABOUT THE JEWELRY STORE LOOKING AND LISTENING
HUH
ANYHOW I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE INDIAN'S WATCH MORE THAN LOOK AT IT AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO RISE EARLY AND HURRY IT THROUGH
WHO'S KILLED SHAG WHY COLONEL SAH IT'S A POOR OLE LADY AN STOP SHAG
NO SAH COLONEL I JEST DOESN'T--ZACTLY WELL I OUGHT TO BE GETTING READY TO GO FISHING
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN JEST BOUT A HOUR AGO
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO GO AT THOSE WIRES
OH NEVER THAT WELL AS YOU CHOOSE HE WENT ON WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
I DON'T LIKE POISON
IF YOU INTERRUPT ME AGAIN WHEN I'M READING MY IZAAK WALTON I'LL HAVE YOU PUT OFF THE TRAIN
SALLIE PAGE SLEEPS ON THE TOP FLOOR WHERE THE JANITOR'S FAMILY LIVES AND HE OF COURSE SLEEPS UP THERE ALSO I SEE MURMURED CARROLL
I AM KNOWN IN COLCHESTER AS COLONEL BRENTNALL HAVING REGISTERED AT THE HOTEL UNDER THAT NAME
I'M GLAD YOU AGREE WITH ME SHAG YES SAH COLONEL UM
DE TRAIN-BOY WHUT YO GIB A DOLLAR T HE HANDED IT T ME WHEN I WAS GITTIN OFF
I'M STILL UP AGAINST IT
I HAVE A NEW DETECTIVE STORY LOOK HERE
SAW THE CROWD I GUESS
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT ASKED MR KETTRIDGE OF THE COLONEL WHEN THE STORE WAS AGAIN DIM AND QUIET
THE PROSECUTOR IS BOUND TO SHOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE WIRES CONTROLLED BY A SWITCH FROM MR DARCY'S TABLE WERE SO ARRANGED THAT HE MIGHT SHOCK HIS COUSIN OR ANY ONE WHO PUT HIS HANDS ON THE SHOWCASE
THE COLONEL'S THEORY THAT SOME FELLOW COUNTRYMAN HAD SUPPLIED THE EAST INDIAN MEANS OF ESCAPING THE ELECTRIC CHAIR WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED
IF I HADN'T BEEN AS SLOW AS A CARP I MIGHT HAVE THE RIGHT MAN HERE NOW IN YOUR PLACE WHAT DO YOU MEAN COLONEL EH
A PRETTY LOVER
NOW HE SMILED AT THE MAN HE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR
SHE WAS STABBED WITH THAT WITH MY KNIFE--THAT PAPER CUTTER DAGGER I WAS GIVING AS A PRESENT TO--TO MY WIFE KING'S VOICE WAS SOBERING MORE NOW
IT ISN'T A DAGGER--IT'S A PAPER-CUTTER--A MAGAZINE KNIFE WELL WHATEVER IT IS WHO OWNS IT THE WORDS WERE AS CRISP AS THE STEEL OF THE STAINED BLADE
WHAT LUCK COLONEL SHE ASKED GAILY
BUT NOW LARCH IS CATERING MORE AND MORE TO PARTIES THAT WOULDN'T COME HERE IF THERE WASN'T SOMETHING STRONG TO DRINK AND THAT'S DRIVING THE OTHER SORT AWAY YES I'VE NOTICED THAT OF LATE AND THAT ISN'T ALL WENT ON YOUNG
HE BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS AND WAS SILENT AND MOTIONLESS A LONG TIME
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS FOR A JOB LIKE THIS--MURDER AND IT WASN'T COLONEL--IT WASN'T
YES--OLD MRS DARCY--THE JEWELRY STORE LADY WENT ON THE BOY
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THESE EAST INDIANS ARE OFTEN CARRIERS OF BUBONIC PLAGUE YOU KNOW AND IT'S VERY CONTAGIOUS
BAD PLACE TOO
IT WAS A SWITCH I HADN'T NOTICED BEFORE--IN FACT I ACCIDENTALLY UNCOVERED IT BY MOVING A COLLECTION OF HIS TOOLS I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY DISTURBED
SHE'S DEAF AND YOU DIDN'T CALL THE JANITOR NO
I WONDER IF THAT'S A NEW KIND OF BURGLAR ALARM THOUGHT THE COLONEL
AND I'VE GROWN TOO FOND OF FISHING
AMY MASON WAS THE FIRST TO GREET HER LOVER WHEN HE STEPPED AWAY FROM THE BENCH OF THE JUDGE BEFORE WHICH HE STOOD TO HEAR HIMSELF CLEARED OF THE CHARGE
HE DONE IT ALL RIGHT AND WE GOT THE GOODS ON HIM
SKIP SPOTTY HE MURMURED AGAIN
HE'S EITHER SENT HER A PRESENT OR IS GOING TO
FOR THE PAPERS OF HER TESTIMONY HAD BEEN SEALED AND IT WAS ONLY BY A SHARP TRICK ON THE PART OF DALEY THAT HE GOT ACCESS TO THEM
AND SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR WERE SOME OF THE CIGARETTES MADE FROM STRONG LATAKIA TOBACCO THE PECULIAR ODOR OF WHICH WAS EVEN YET NOTICEABLE IN THE CORNERS OF THE CELL
YOU WON'T SEE ME IF I SEE YOU FIRST
HE HAS A FINE ONE FOR I'VE SEEN HIM STOP IN FRONT OF OUR WINDOW AND COMPARE HIS TIME WITH OUR CHRONOMETER I SEE
OH YES INDEED
THE COLONEL MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES AND HAD DESCRIBED TO HIM THE EXACT POSITION OF THE BODY BEING TOLD ALL THAT WENT ON THAT TRAGIC MORNING
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT WATCHES THOUGH I QUESTION IF HE EVER SAW ONE LIKE THIS THE COLONEL WAS ABOUT TO USE HIS TELEPHONE WHEN IT RANG AND ANSWERING IT HE WAS TOLD THAT ANOTHER VISITOR WISHED TO SEE HIM
I WONDER WHAT'S UP THIS TIME HE INQUIRED CASUALLY FROM THOSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE THRONG AND RECEIVED ENOUGH INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY THE GETTING OUT OF SEVERAL EXTRA NEWSPAPERS
BUT SO HELP ME I NEVER CROAKED THAT OLD LADY THEN HOW DID YOU GET THAT CROSS I WON'T TELL YOU I'LL MAKE YOU SPOTTY AND THERE WAS A DANGEROUS GLINT IN THE EYES OF THE COLONEL
THE TICKING WATCH II
I'M STRONG FER YOU
SHE'S DEAD HE WHISPERED SOFTLY
WHAT'S THAT WATCH TICKING HE ASKED PAUSING
THERE HE TOSSED THE PAPER BEHIND THE BED
IT'LL BE NOISY ENOUGH LATER ON THOUGH
THEY ARE ARRANGED WITH ELECTRIC LIGHTS INSIDE THAT MAY BE SWITCHED ON WHEN NEEDED
THE DOG WAS A FRIENDLY ANIMAL AND HAD MADE MANY FRIENDS IN THE HOTEL
SO IT WAS TURNED OVER TO HIM BUT DID HE REALLY KILL HIS PARTNER SUREST THING YOU KNOW
IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR IT WAS VERY CLEAN
I MUST GET IT OUT OF MY MIND IN SPITE OF HIS RATHER EXACTING DEMANDS REGARDING A FERRULE FOR HIS ROD HE FOUND WHAT HE WANTED AND FEELING QUITE SATISFIED NOW AS HE NOTED THAT THE WEATHER SHOWED SOME SLIGHT SIGNS OF CLEARING THE COLONEL STARTED BACK FOR HIS HOTEL WALKING SLOWLY FOR IT WAS NOT YET LATE
WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT ASKED THE BOY
YOU SEE IT'S THIS WAY SHE WENT ON ADDRESSING THE COLONEL
THIS IS MY LAST CASE EXCLAIMED THE DETECTIVE AS HE SLIPPED HIS PRIZE INTO THE GRASS-LINED CREEL
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL ANY ONE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR SO I WENT ABOUT QUIETLY
HOW COULD THE VISITOR CEASED HIS QUESTIONS TO WATCH THE COLONEL WHO HAD GONE TO A CLOSET AND TAKEN OUT A PAIR OF RUBBER GLOVES
YOU KNOW WHAT ALMOST BECAME OF THEM
YOU SEE SAID THE COLONEL TO MR KETTRIDGE
I WILL SIR IF I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF THE MILITARY-APPEARING TRAVELER SNAPPED THE GREEN BOOK AGAINST THE PALM OF ONE HAND WITH A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A PISTOL THEREBY CAUSING AN OLD LADY ASLEEP IN A CHAIR ACROSS THE AISLE TO AWAKEN WITH A START
FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A GASPING FISH ON THE BANK WAS THE SIMILE THE COLONEL USED
THIS IS TALKING IN RIDDLES THOUGH I BEGIN TO SEE A LITTLE I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE GIRL
THE INDIAN WATCH THOUGH IMPREGNATED WITH POISON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF MRS DARCY THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY SCRATCHED BY THE HIDDEN NEEDLE
DON'T MUTTERED DARCY IN A STRAINED VOICE
THE GHOST OF A SMILE FLICKERED AROUND HIS LIPS
I'VE HOOKED YOU THIS TIME AS YOU HOOKED LANGFORD LARCH MURMURED JACK YOUNG WHO SAT ON THE BANK IN THE SHADE WHILE THE COLONEL FISHED AND SHAG WAS SETTING OUT LUNCH UNDER THE TREES
THAT WAS THE NAME HE USED BUT NOW HE HAS CONSENTED TO TAKE YOUR CASE HE'S COLONEL ASHLEY AGAIN AND WHAT AM I TO DO AMY JUST WHAT HE TELLS YOU--NOTHING MORE OR LESS
I'M THROUGH SPIELIN AND THE CROOK TURNED AWAY WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE
WELL WHAT DOES HE SAY BASSET ASKED THE COLONEL WHEN HE HAD PROVIDED HIS MAN WITH A CIGAR
SO FAR YOU HAVEN'T BEEN RECOGNIZED THEN ONLY BY YOU AND IT'D TAKE A PRETTY CLEVER GUY NO COMPLIMENTS SPOTTY
WHO FOUND HER THIS WAY I DID ANSWERED DARCY
THEN TOM CAME AND TOLD ME WHEN HE READ OF YOUR--OF YOUR OH SAY ARREST AMY
GOT DRUNK THASH WHAT I DID
DAT'S JEST WHAT IT IS
AND DARCY DIDN'T REPAIR SINGA PHUT'S WATCH WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD
THE TALL MAN BOWED AGAIN RESUMED HIS SEAT AND TRIED TO READ BUT HIS FEELINGS HAD BEEN TOO MUCH RUFFLED IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALLOW A PEACEFUL RESUMPTION OF HIS FORMER MOOD
I MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF CYNTHIA
THE OTHER ISN'T OUR CASE
I WAS PUTTERING AROUND THE WORK TABLE WHERE DARCY USED TO DO HIS JEWEL SETTING AND HIS REPAIR WORK AND SALLIE WAS OVER NEAR THE SHOWCASE
HIS HAVING THAT ODD COIN WAS WHAT PUT ME ON HIS TRAIL AGAIN AND I SENT FOR YOU TO SHADOW HIM AS I HAD TOO MANY OTHER IRONS IN THE FIRE
THEN THINGS QUIETED DOWN AND NOBODY HEARD ANYTHING MORE
AND I WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN THE COLONEL GETS GOING WE'LL HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE IN SHORT ORDER MR DARCY BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU ABOUT JIMMIE BOY
AND YET HE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT I HAD CALLED HIM
AND NOW I SHALL TELL YOU THAT THE FISHING WITH A NATURAL FLY IS EXCELLENT AND AFFORDS MUCH PLEASURE IT WON'T DO EJACULATED THE COLONEL AS HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND THREW IT ASIDE
I'D A SENT HIM TO THE CHAIR WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
AND THERE'S A LADY WITH HIM A LADY YES
AND SO WONDERING MUCH THE COLONEL AND MR KETTRIDGE THE FORMER WITH THE RARE COIN WENT OUT INTO THE COOL AND STAR-LIT NIGHT LEAVING BEHIND THEM THE SOUNDS OF GOOD-FELLOWSHIP OF THAT PARTICULAR BRAND IN THE HOMESTEAD
WHERESH THA PAPER CUTTER I LEFT FOR YOU T GRAVE PEARL'S NAME ON
THEY HAD MET PREVIOUSLY
HE SAYS WHEN HE AND BLUE IKE PLANNED TO ROB GRAFTON'S STORE THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME REAL JEWELRY THERE ROB GRAFTON'S STORE CRIED THE COLONEL
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND SEE HOW HE ACTS
WELL HERE WE ARE
UH AH MURMURED SHAG AS CAREFULLY HE PUT AWAY THE DELICATE ROD AND REEL
MAY I COME TO SEE YOU
BUT HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT
AND THE COLONEL HAD HE NOT BEEN A MAN OF EXPERIENCE MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED THIS NERVOUSNESS TO INFLUENCE HIS JUDGMENT AND BRING INTO TOO MUCH PROMINENCE THE FIRST SUSPICIONS THE DETECTIVE HAD FELT REGARDING THIS MAN
I WAS JUST GOING TO TELEPHONE TO HEADQUARTERS HE TOLD BRIEFLY WHAT HE KNEW WHICH WAS CORROBORATED BY TREMLAIN THEN THE TWO LEFT TO COVER THEIR ROUTES AFTER GIVING THEIR ADDRESSES TO THE POLICEMAN
HE LOOKED AROUND CAREFULLY AND SAW THAT THE STRANGE MAN HAD MOVED ON AND THEY WERE ALONE
MEMORIES
FOR DUSK HAD FALLEN AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS WERE AGLOW IN THE PULLMAN MAKING IT A VERY COSY PLACE IN CONTRAST TO THE DAMP AND MUDDY COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THE TRAIN WAS RUSHING
EVERY ONE IN TOWN KNOWS HIM AS ONE OF THE PROMINENT MERCHANTS WAS HE AT THE STORE THE DAY OF THE--THE DAY MRS DARCY WAS KILLED I DON'T REMEMBER
BUT I HEARD THEM TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE WHAT LARCH DROPPED A HINT THAT HE AND HIS WIFE MIGHT BE RECONCILED THE DEUCE YOU SAY THAT'S RIGHT COLONEL
SHAG GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
THOSE WHO MIGHT BE LATE AT BENCH LATHE OR LOOM UNHEEDED THE PASSING OF TIME
WHEN'D YOU FIND HER LIKE THIS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO
MISS RATCHFORD TO YOU ALWAYS AFTER THIS OH VERY WELL
CAN'T YOU SEE
AND NOW CAT AND HE NODDED PATRONIZINGLY TO THE WHITE-APRONED AND RESPECTFUL BARTENDER WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO SEE WHAT MY FRIENDS WILL BE PLEASED TO ORDER THAT THEY MAY POUR OUT A LIBATION TO--LET US SAY POLONIUS WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKED
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT
I DIDN'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE
I JUST HAD A LETTER FROM CYN--FROM MISS RATCHFORD SAYING SHE HAS THE CROSS SHE HAS THE MISSING DIAMOND CROSS FAIRLY CRIED THE DETECTIVE
NOW TO BUSINESS AND THE COLONEL DREW SOME PAPERS FROM HIS POCKET
YES SAH COLONEL IS IT MUCH OF A MYSTERY--I MEAN--ER--ANYTHING BUT THE USUAL BLOOD AND THUNDER STUFF WHY COLONEL BEGAN THE BLACK MAN EAGERLY IT'S DE BEATENIST MYSTERY DAT EVER WAS--ALL BOUT A MURDERED JEWELRY LADY WHAT'S GOT HER HAID BUSTED IN WITH A BIG GOLD STATUE AN A GOLD KNIFE STAB IN HER SIDE AN A WATCH SHUT UP TIGHT IN HER HAND TICKIN AN TICKIN AN TICKIN LAIK IT WAS HER HEART BEATIN AN HER COUSIN DONE FIND HER IN A POOL OF BLOOD ON DE FLOOR AN DE CLOCKS ALL STOPPED AN A RICH YOUNG SPENDTHRIFT COMES IN AN CLAIMS DE DAGGER AN DE DETECTIVES SHAG FAIRLY SHOUTED HIS MASTER
WELL IT'LL BE BETTER BY TO-MORROW I EXPECT WHEN WE GO FISHING
FOUND I WAS GETTING A BIT STALE IN MY GOLF DON'T YOU KNOW THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE WHILE HE REGAINED THE USE OF HIS TREACHEROUS TONGUE THEN HE WENT ON--"I CAUGHT MYSELF FOOZLING A FEW PUTTS AND I CONCLUDED I NEEDED TO WORK BACK UP TO FORM THERE WAS A LAUGH AT THIS FOR SCARCELY ONE IN THE GILDED GRILL BUT KNEW WHERE KING HAD BEEN AND WHITHER HE WAS GOING
DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK HE SAW AMY MASON WALKING SLOWLY ALONG
THIS WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE COLONEL
NO SINGA PHUT DIDN'T HAVE A THING TO DO WITH THE KILLING I'M POSITIVE OF THAT AND HIS ALIBI IS PERFECT SAID THE COLONEL
FOR PERHAPS TEN MINUTES IT REMAINED THUS AND THEN IT BEGAN TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF UNEASINESS
THE GAME'S UP
BUT IF IT IS A MATTER IN WHICH YOU WISH MY ADVICE THEN I CERTAINLY DO NEED ADVICE COLONEL
I'LL FINISH THIS YES SAH COLONEL A FACT WHICH THE WISE SHAG HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG
I DID NOT EVEN TELL CYNTHIA THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE SAID THE COLONEL
YOU NEVER CAN TELL NO THAT'S SO LEFT ALONE JAMES DARCY THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND LOOKED BLANKLY AT THE DULL-PAINTED WALL
IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE
THERE SEEM TO BE OTHERS BESIDES THE ROMAN COIN GONE SAID THE JEWELER FOR I NOW MISS MANY I USED TO SEE IN HER CASE
FOLLOWING HIS VISIT TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND HIS RETURN TO THE HOTEL HE HAD CALLED KENNETH ON THE TELEPHONE AND ARRANGED TO SPEND A QUIET DAY WITH HIM IN THE FIELDS NEAR THE STREAM
WAS THAT SO YES AND I AM SORRY TO SAY IT WAS PARTLY ABOUT YOU I DON'T MIND JIMMIE BOY
BUT WHEN THE DETECTIVE REACHED THE ESTABLISHMENT HE SAW TO HIS SURPRISE A GREAT CROWD GATHERED OUT IN FRONT--A CROWD THAT NEEDED THE SERVICES OF SEVERAL POLICEMEN TO KEEP IT FROM STOPPING TRAFFIC IN THE ROADWAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED CARROLL QUICKLY
THE SLIM LITTLE MAN GAVE A WIGGLE LIKE AN EEL AND WOULD HAVE DARTED AWAY THROUGH THE CROWD BUT THERE WAS A VICE-LIKE GRIP ON HIS SHOULDER THAT HE KNEW BUT TOO WELL
I HAVEN'T HAD MY BREAKFAST
BUT HARRY KING NEEDS WATCHING I AGREE WITH YOU
SPOTTY!--SPOTTY MORGAN GASPED THE DETECTIVE AS HE RECOGNIZED A NEW YORK GUNMAN WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE KILLING TO HIS CREDIT OR DEBIT ACCORDING AS YOU HAPPEN TO RECKON
ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES THE COLONEL VISITED THE NEXT DAY WAS THE JEWELRY SHOP
HERE COMES MISS BRILL SAID ONE OF THE MEN CLERKS TO DARCY
THIS IS NO MORE PLEASANT FOR ME THAN FOR YOU BUT IT MUST BE DONE
NOT A PERSON--NOT A VEHICLE--WAS IN SIGHT
SHAG HE EXPLODED
SO LOOSEN UP AS SOON AS YOU CAN THEY TOOK KING AND DARCY TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS IN A TAXICAB WHICH KING WITH STILL HALF-DRUNKEN GRAVITY INSISTED ON PAYING FOR
WHO THE DEVIL ARE YOU TO COME BETWEEN ME AND MY DON'T DARE PROFANE THAT NAME WARNED THE WOMAN
DARCY HAD AT FIRST NERVOUSLY AND THEN INDIGNANTLY PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE KING CONTINUALLY DOING THE LATTER
HE'S A MAN THAT'S WHAT JAMES DARCY IS AMY'S FATHER HAD SAID WHEN SOME ONE HINTED THAT HE HAD NEITHER WEALTH NOR FAMILY OF WHICH TO BOAST
AND IF LARCH IS LOSING MONEY OH WELL HE MAY HAVE HELD OUT SOME OR MAYBE THE DIAMOND CROSS ISN'T SO ELABORATE
YES WHAT IS IT A TELEGRAM FOR YOU COLONEL SEND IT UP TEARING OPEN THE ENVELOPE COLONEL ASHLEY READ
WHAT'S IN IT THAT'S SO MIGHTY INTERESTING ER--COLONEL--YO SEE--YO DONE TOLE ME OH OUT WITH IT SHAG
GO ON JACK AND IN A FEW MORE SECONDS THE COLONEL ADDED
BUT THERE ARE SOME PECULIAR COINCIDENCES AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THEM GO AS FAR AS YOU LIKE COLONEL RETURNED THONG NEEDLESSLY GENEROUS
A PERSON MIGHT GET A SHOCK THAT WOULD KNOCK HIM DOWN AND SOMETHING SEEMED TO GIVE THE COLONEL A NEW IDEA
IT WHINED AND ITS BODY WAS SHAKEN AS WITH A COLD SHIVER
CROAKED I TOLD YOU
I THOUGHT MR GRAFTON WAS I THINK THAT IS HE COMING NOW SAID THE OLD DETECTIVE QUIETLY AS THE SOUND OF SOME ONE RUNNING UP THE PATH WAS BORNE TO THEIR STRAINED SENSES
NATURALLY THERE FOLLOWED EVEN WITH THE FAINT SUSPICIONS SO FAR ENGENDERED THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE POSSIBLE OBJECT FOR THE CRIME COULD HAVE BEEN PRESUMING EITHER MAN HAD BEEN INVOLVED
MAYBE THE PROSECUTION HAS SOMETHING UP THEIR SLEEVE THEY'RE WAITING TO SPRING
THE CAPTAIN'LL WANT TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU AND I GUESS THE PROSECUTOR THE SAME
THE COLONEL SCANNED THE FRONT PAGE WITH ITS BLACK TYPE EAGERLY
HE LET THE CASE GO BY DEFAULT FOR WHICH I WAS GLAD AS IT SAVED CYNTHIA FROM TELLING HER STORY IN OPEN COURT
WE BECAME FRIENDS AGAIN--IN FACT WE HAD NEVER CEASED TO BE FRIENDS
DARCY SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE WAY IT USED TO BE WAS THAT THE HOMESTEAD WAS PATRONIZED BY A GOOD CLASS OF PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS SOME THAT EVEN WERE OPPOSED TO THE LIQUOR TRADE
AND THERE'S THE CROSS AND BASSET TOSSED ON THE TABLE BESIDE THE COLONEL A BATTERED CROSS OF GOLD IN WHICH SPARKLED MANY STONES WITH THE LIMPID FIRE OF HIDDEN RAINBOWS
AND PERHAPS LARCH ISN'T SO BAD A CHAP AS YOU'D HAVE ME BELIEVE
THE WATCH WAS WOUND UP--I WOUND IT MYSELF AS A MATTER OF FACT THOUGH I DID NOT DREAM THAT THE TIME MECHANISM HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE POISONED NEEDLE
I WASN'T VERY WIDE AWAKE AND I DIDN'T REALLY ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT UNTIL AFTER I SAW HER--DEAD UM
NO I CAN'T SAY
I JUST DON'T KNOW
I'M TOO OLD
THE MAN AND WOMAN PASSED ON
THE STORE WAS NOT A LARGE ONE AND FOUR CLERKS ONE A YOUNG WOMAN WITH JAMES DARCY AND AN ASSISTANT WHO LOOKED AFTER THE REPAIR WORK AND MADE ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE WAY OF PINS OR RINGS CONSTITUTED THE FORCE
WELL WE'LL GET AT THE TRUTH SOMEHOW
I'VE KNOWN HIM TO DO THAT MORE THAN ONCE AND HE LOST MRS DARCY CUSTOMERS THAT WAY
NEVER SHE ANSWERED BITTERLY
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THAT PLEADED THE GUNMAN
THERE'S AS GOOD FISH IN THAT STREAM AS ANY I DIDN'T CATCH AND I WANT TO TRY MY LUCK YES SAH COLONEL
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU WHO I AM
WE WILL NOT BE DISTURBED AND UP THERE SHE GASPED
I WAS ANXIOUS TO FINISH THE REPAIR JOB FOR A MAN WHO WAS TO LEAVE ON AN EARLY TRAIN THIS MORNING
I WONDER WHAT CARROLL AND THONG WOULD SAY IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THE DIAMOND CROSS AND HEARD THAT SPOTTY MORGAN HAD IT
IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SLIP OF MINE IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK WAS PURE ACCIDENT I'D SAY YOU STAGED IT JUST TO MAKE A GOOD GET-AWAY I COULDN'T DO THAT COLONEL I DON'T KNOW SPOTTY
SEEMED QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT MEETING YOU
HE CAN DO IT AS WELL AS I
YOU KNOW MY LITTLE HABITS IN THAT REGARD
I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF AND WHEN I HEARD THAT NOISE WHICH I REGRET EXCEEDINGLY MADAM INTERPOSED THE MILITARY-APPEARING TRAVELER WITH ANOTHER BOW
JIMMIE BOY AS YOUR AMY CALLS HIM--BLESS HER HEART--WAS A BIT CARELESS BUT THAT WAS ALL
I FOLLOWED YOU HERE--IN FACT I ONLY ENTERED THIS OFFICE A MINUTE OR TWO AHEAD OF YOU
BUT I'LL NEED A LITTLE MONEY IF I'M TO KEEP UP HIS PACE
DARCY WITH A LOOK AT AMY MASON WHICH SHE RETURNED WITH ONE OF ASSURANCE AND CONFIDENCE WAS TAKEN BACK TO JAIL
HE'S SORTER RETIRED NOW BUT STILL HE'S CHOCK FULL OF CRIMES MURDER AN STUFF LAIK DAT AN DAT'S WHY HE DONE SENT YO AWAY SORTER ROUGH-LAIK YOU SAY HE'S A PRIVATE DETECTIVE ASKED THE BOY HIS EYES OPENING WIDE
FOR THE TIME BEING HE DROPPED SEVERAL OTHER ENDS--TANGLED ENDS OF THE SKEIN HE HOPED TO UNRAVEL--AND DEVOTED HIS TIME TO GRAFTON
EARLY IN THE UNEQUAL CONTEST THE SUN HAD GIVEN UP ITS EFFORT TO PIERCE THROUGH THE LEADEN CLOUDS AND HAD TAKEN ITS BEAMS TO OTHER PLACES--TO BUSY CITIES TO SMILING COUNTRY VILLAGES AND FARMS
NEVER OH I DON'T MEAN FISHING SHAG
TOO FAR PERHAPS
EVIDENTLY GRAFTON DIDN'T AT THAT TIME KNOW IT WAS ONLY THE CRUSHED AND DIAMONDLESS CROSS THAT LARCH HAD SENT BACK
HIS LONG ARTISTIC FINGERS WERE TREMBLING AND HE FELT WEAK AND FAINT
THE COLONEL AND HIS FRIEND FINISHED THEIR MODEST MEAL AND THEIR MORE MODEST POTATIONS OF NO VERY STRONG LIQUIDS AND WENT OUT LEAVING HARRY KING AND HIS COMPANIONS TO MAKE A NIGHT OF IT LARCH WHOSE FACE WAS UNUSUALLY FLUSHED WAS ENDEAVORING TO BRING THE YOUNG MEN TO A LESS BOISTEROUS STATE FOR HE REALIZED THAT HIS BETTER CLASS OF PATRONS DID NOT LIKE THIS SORT OF THING
I THOUGHT I HEARD THE NEWSBOYS SHOUTING SOMETHING ABOUT IT AT THE STATION
YOU SAY THERE'S A MYSTERY ABOUT IT SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
THE POINT IS TO STICK TO KING
AND YOU ARE RIGHT
AND THEN AGAIN THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN CROSSED ON PURPOSE
HE'S JAMMED A FERRULE AND WITH BLAZING EYES THE COLONEL LOOKED AT ONE OF THE JOINTS OF HIS CHOICEST ROD
BUT DON'T TALK TOO MUCH
WELL YOU LANGFORD I NEVER BAH
NOW WE'LL KNOW WHAT KILLED HER AND WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO START ON--MAYBE I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ALREADY OBSERVED CARROLL
I'VE GOT TO DO MY DUTY
I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE A REAL TRUTH THAT THE VERY SITTING BY THE RIVER'S SIDE IS NOT ONLY THE QUIETEST AND FITTEST PLACE FOR CONTEMPLATION BUT WILL INVITE THE ANGLER TO IT
CRIMPS WHAT A NAME
AS THE STATUE FELL LARCH LEANED FORWARD TO GRASP IT HE SAID BUT HE SLIPPED AND THE KNIFE IN HIS HAND ENTERED HER SIDE AND SHE FELL ON IT DRIVING IT DEEPER IN
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME HE'S KILLED DO YOU NO SAH COLONEL
DON'T EXCLAIMED THE COLONEL REACHING OUT A RESTRAINING HAND
IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE A MYSTERY AFTER ALL IN SPITE OF THE TWO MEN WHO ARE HELD
ON A WATCH WHERE'S THE WATCH NOW AND THE DETECTIVE FLICKED THE ASHES FROM A CIGAR THE REPORTER HAD GIVEN HIM
YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT DARCY WELL I THOUGHT I WAS
LOOK OUT COLONEL OR YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID WAS THE CALM ANSWER AS THE OTHER TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR
BUT IN A JEWELRY STORE THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF CLOCKS MAKING A NOISE AND--SAY HE SUDDENLY CRIED THERE'S NOT A CLOCK IN THIS PLACE TICKING--NOTICE THAT
WELL HE GAVE ME MY LIFE AND I JUST HAD TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE FOR HIS
WHO OWNS IT AND THE QUESTION SNAPPED LIKE A WHIP
YOU SAY THE HOTEL CLERK TOLD YOU I WAS HERE
THEN WHEN THE TWO BULLS WHO PINCHED SPOTTY AND IKE TESTED THE DIAMONDS IN THE CROSS AND FOUND THEY WAS PHONEY--AS THEY MIGHT HAVE GUESSED COMING FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE--SPOTTY WAS FIT TO BE TIED HE WAS SO WILD
SAY NO WONDER HE FLEW AT ME HE DIDN'T MEAN NOTHIN SAID SHAG STILL CHUCKLING AS HE THOUGHT OF THE SCENE
AM I RIGHT OR WRONG
FROM THE PLACE IN WHICH HUNG ODD COATS CAPS AND OTHER GARMENTS AND FROM THE SHELF ON WHICH WAS A COLLECTION OF GRUESOME WEAPONS CAME AN INSISTENT TICKING
LET'S HAVE A LOOK SUGGESTED THE COLONEL
DID HE EVER DO ANY BUSINESS WITH YOU--I MEAN BUY ANYTHING IN THE STORE WHY YES I THINK VERY POSSIBLY HE MIGHT
MORE AS ONCE I'SE HEAH YO SAY AS HOW YO HAD T FISH AN FISH AN FISH T GIT A BIT OF A CLEW I SEE YOU REMEMBER SHAG
DARCY TOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW HE HAD COME DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND HIS RELATIVE STRETCHED ON THE FLOOR OF THE SHOP AND ASIDE FROM THAT LITTLE RESTLESS PERIOD OF THE NIGHT HE HAD HEARD NO DISTURBANCE
THAT'S THE REASON HE GOT SUCH A PRETTY WIFE I HEAR
MRS DARCY WHO WAS SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE HAD CARRIED ON THE JEWELRY BUSINESS OF HER HUSBAND MORTIMER DARCY AFTER HIS DEATH WHICH PRECEDED HER MORE TRAGIC ONE BY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS
YES I'M ON MY WAY NOW
NEVER HAD SO MUSH FUN--NEVER
WHAT'S THAT SOME ONE IS KNOCKING REMARKED HIS COMPANION
HAVE YOU SO SIMPLE A THEORY REGARDING THE QUEER STATE I WAS IN THAT NIGHT--I MEAN AWAKENING AND GOING TO SLEEP AGAIN AFTER FEELING SOMETHING BRUSH MY FACE NOT UNLESS LARCH TRIED TO CHLOROFORM YOU AFTER HE HAD KILLED MRS DARCY AND WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT COME DOWN AND DISCOVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE
SHAG'S ANSWER WAS GIVEN IN A PECULIAR MANNER
BUT HE FORGOT THE TICKING WATCH IT WAS SIMPLE MURMURED DARCY
I GUESS YOU MILITARY MEN KNOW THAT WE DOCTORS ARE IN A SORT OF CLASS WITH YOURSELVES WHEN IT COMES TO THAT YOU'RE RIGHT
THE CUSTOMERS WERE PLEASED AND THEY PAID HER EXTRA FOR THE ORNAMENTS
KING WAS FRANK ENOUGH--SOBER NOW--TO SAY HE HAD BEEN DRUNK ALL NIGHT--SPENDING THE HOURS WITH BOON COMPANIONS IN A NOTORIOUS RESORT A STATEMENT WHICH SEEMED CAPABLE ENOUGH OF PROOF
YOU'RE KIDDIN HE'S CROAKED ANSWERED THE DEPUTY WARDEN
TELL SPOTTY I'LL ARRANGE TO HAVE HIM BAILED
THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN FORCED OPEN--IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO ASCERTAIN THAT
I DON'T WANT T HEAH BOUT NO BATTLES MURDER AN SUDDEN DEATHS
NO NOT AT ALL
THIS IS FAR ENOUGH SHE SAID AND SHE TURNED SO THAT THE FAST-FADING LIGHT OF THE WEST WAS ON HER VEILED FACE
OH IT'S ALL RIGHT BOYS WENT ON THE DETECTIVE
I JUST MENTIONED THAT AS MOST PROBABLE
IT MAY BE THAT I CAN NOT SERVE YOU
I NEVER SAID I WAS OH I BEG YOUR PARDON I MUST HAVE INFERRED THAT
HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON JACK ASKED THE COLONEL WHO REACHED THE HOTEL SOON AFTER HIS TALK WITH SHAG
IF I CAN LOOK INSIDE THAT AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE MECHANISM IS SO OBVIOUS THAT DARCY MUST HAVE STUMBLED ON IT WHEN HE STARTED TO REPAIR IT--IF HE DID--THEN WELL THAT COMPLICATES MATTERS
I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED THOUGH I MAY BE WRONG
WHY KETTRIDGE TELEPHONED TO MY ROOM AND SHAG TOOK THE MESSAGE AND REPEATED IT TO ME
HE MADE A BIG HOWL ABOUT GETTING BACK HIS WATCH AND AS HE HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD ALIBI AND WE COULD FASTEN NOTHING ON HIM WE GIVE IT BACK TO HIM AND TOLD HIM TO BEAT IT
WE MAY HAVE TO KILL A RAT IN COURT AS WE DID IN SINGA PHUT'S CELL I THINK WE ARE COMING ON MUSED COLONEL ASHLEY WHEN HIS TWO VISITORS HAD GONE
GOT TO LEAVE IT UNTIL THE CORONER SEES IT
YES BUT MRS DARCY MAY HAVE SLIPPED IT BACK HERSELF
IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY OLD TIMEPIECE--ONE OF THE FIRST MADE SMALLER THAN THE OLD NUREMBERG EGGS I FANCY
WITNESS WHAT HAPPENED TO POOR LITTLE CHET
I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT IT--NOR COULD SHE SHE
BUT YOU MUST KEEP MY SECRET IF I AM TO HELP YOU
COULD SPOTTY THE COLONEL WHISPERED THE LAST NAME TO HIMSELF AND THEN STOPPED SHORT
YES AT FIRST I THOUGHT SOME ONE HAD BEEN IN MY ROOM AND THEN AFTER I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I WASN'T QUITE SURE
HE MADE A HURRIED EXAMINATION OF THE WIRES AND THEN LEFT THE STORE TO BE SEEN A LITTLE LATER AT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ELECTRICIAN WHERE HE STAYED SOME TIME
HURRY AND GET THE POLICE BEGGED DARCY
I KNOW IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY BAD IT WASN'T
DID YOU COME DIRECTLY DOWN TO THE STORE FROM YOUR ROOM ASKED THONG
KING SAID THAT THOUGH THE FRONT DOORS TO THE STORE WERE LOCKED HE KNOWING THE PLACE WELL HAD GONE AROUND TO THE SIDE DOOR IN THE ALLEY THINKING THAT MIGHT NOT YET BE FASTENED
I'VE BEEN DOING THE BUYING LATELY WELL HAVE A LOOK
THE COLONEL LOOKING GUILTILY AROUND THE ROOM WALKED NEARER TO THE BED AND THEN AS STEALTHILY AS THOUGH COMMITTING A THEFT HE PICKED UP THE TIMES
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT FISHING ALL RIGHT
SAY I WISH I COULD GO FISHING AND THE COLONEL SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DOGGED IMPATIENCE AT THE TANGLE INTO WHICH THE AFFAIR HAD SNARLED ITSELF
I CONFESS THIS STARTLES ME
THAT WAS AWAY BACK IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT
I REGRET AS REGARDS THE COUNSEL ON THE OTHER SIDE HAVING TO DO THIS AS HE ASSURES ME HE IS READY AND ANXIOUS TO GO TO TRIAL BUT IT IS UNAVOIDABLE AND I PROMISE THIS THAT IF THE WITNESS REFERRED TO IS NOT HERE TWO WEEKS FROM TO-DAY I WILL GO ON WITH THE CASE ANYHOW HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY MR KENNETH ASKED THE JUDGE OF DARCY'S LAWYER
BUT SHE INTERRUPTED WITH
THE WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT WITH EYES THAT SEEMED TO BURN THROUGH HER VEIL AND THEN FOLLOWED
HERE'S A DOLLAR I GET YOU COLONEL
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME
SWIFTLY WENT THE NEWS TO THE JAIL AND LATER TO THE COURTHOUSE WHENCE AFTER A CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE GRAVE JUDGE AND A SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THOUGH PERHAPS GLADLY SO PROSECUTOR OF THE PLEAS JAMES DARCY WALKED FORTH A FREE MAN HONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE CUSTODY OF THE COURT THE INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR MURDER QUASHED
THE DIAMOND CROSS IX
HE MAY AS HE SAYS HAVE GOTTEN UP EARLY TO REDEEM HIS PROMISE TO REPAIR IT BUT HE NEVER DID ASKED THE COLONEL
AT FIRST I DID THINK YOU MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MURDER GOD FORBID SAID THE MERCHANT EARNESTLY AND REVERENTLY
I WONDER IF THEY HAVE ANY CONNECTION I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN HAVE
I LIKE MY SLEEP HE WAS SMILING AND CHEERFUL WAS DR WARREN
FIRST I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT STATUE--THE ONE OF THE HUNTER WITH WHICH IT IS SUPPOSED MRS DARCY WAS STRUCK OH THAT IS AT THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE--THAT AND HARRY KING'S UNFORTUNATE PAPER KNIFE SO THEY ARE
NO ALIMONY XII
WAIT
THAT IS WHY I REVEALED MYSELF TO YOU
LET'S LOOK A BIT FURTHER HE GLANCED AT THE FLOOR ABOUT THE BODY PEERED AROUND THE EDGE OF A SHOWCASE UNDERNEATH WHICH THERE WAS A SPACE FOR REFUSE--ODDS AND ENDS DISCARDED WRAPPING PAPER AND THE LIKE--A PLACE INTO WHICH NEITHER OF THE DETECTIVES HAD AS YET GLANCED
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF ME
BUT HE'S VERY DIFFERENT SINCE HIS WIFE SEPARATED FROM HIM
WELL DETECTIVE WORK IS A SORT OF HUNT ISN'T IT SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
THASH WHAT WE DID GUESS HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE OBSERVED CARROLL GRIMLY
AND IF SO BY WHOM COMMITTED
OH COLONEL BRENTNALL YOU WILL HELP US--WON'T YOU SHE STOOD THERE A BEAUTIFUL AND PATHETIC PICTURE
WELL I COULDN'T BE SURE
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR SOME TIME BUT MY COUSIN OBJECTED TO MY SPENDING MY TIME THAT WAY
LOOKS TO ME MORE LIKE MURDER THE MILKMAN WHISTLED SET HIS COLLECTION OF BOTTLES BACK IN HIS WAGON AND HURRIED WITH DARCY TOWARD THE STORE
IT'S BLEEDING CRIED JACK POINTING
I'M SORRY FOR YOUNG DARCY AND I BELIEVE OH WELL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING NOW
I GOT SOMETHING HERE
HE JUST GIVE ME THIS LETTER AND VERY LIKELY HE FORGOT ABOUT THE FISHING PART AND THE DETECTIVE SMILED GRIMLY
I'M GOING TO QUIT NOW SHAG YES SAH COLONEL GET ME KEDGE ON THE LONG DISTANCE MR KEDGE IN N YORK SAH YES
LEAVE IT AS IT IS BUT PUT IT UNDER GLASS AND THE NEEDLE AWAY CAREFULLY
AND TO THINK THE JEWELS ARE PASTE AND THE COLONEL LOOKED AT THEM SPARKLING IN THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AS BRAVELY AS THOUGH THEY WERE WORTH A FORTUNE INSTEAD OF BEING WHAT A POOR SHOP GIRL MIGHT WEAR TO A BRICKLAYER'S BALL
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR CHANCE
THE RAIN STILL DRIZZLED AND TURNED TO STEAM AND MIST AS IT WARMED ON THE MANY BODIES IN THE THRONG--A MIST THAT MINGLED WITH THAT OF THE RAIN ITSELF
NO--NOTHING NOW WENT ON THE COLONEL WAVING THE MAN AWAY
MY FATHER IS WELL OFF
ONLY SALLIE PAGE THE COOK
ONLY SALLIE PAGE THE COOK
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE ASKED COLONEL ASHLEY
HOW DOES YOUR LOYALTY MEET THE TEST AMY MASON DREW HERSELF UP A SPLENDID FIGURE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMANHOOD
WELL BOY DAT BOOK'S ALL DE COLONEL EVER READS WHEN HE'S VACATIONIN AN DAT'S WHUT HE'S DOIN NOW--JEST VACATIONIN WHEN WE START AWAY DIS MAWNIN HE SAY TO ME THE COLONEL DID
WHAT'S THIS
AND I MUST GET BACK TO THE SHOP SAID MR KETTRIDGE
SECOND TIME THIS WEEK YOU'VE GOT ME OUT OF BED BEFORE MY TIME
THERE WAS A SUDDEN SLIDING AN ENDEAVOR TO RETAIN HIS FOOTING AND THEN COLONEL ASHLEY FELL PROSTRATE HIS FISHING ROD PIECES SPINNING FROM HIS FINGERS
ONLY THAT I REGRET THE DELAY AS MUCH AS DOES THE PROSECUTOR AND THAT WE WILL BE READY ANY TIME
RATHER IDLY THE COLONEL HAVING MERCIFULLY KILLED HIS FISH BY A BLOW ON TOP OF THE HEAD AND SLIPPED IT INTO THE GRASS-LINED CREEL LOOKED UP TO SEE APPROACHING A YOUNG LADY AND A TALL AND SOMEWHAT LANKY BOY
DR WARREN UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION AND DREW OUT A METAL STATUE ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH
A DOG XVI
I PLANNED TO DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT THE LIGHT WAS TOO POOR
THE BURGLAR--OR WHOEVER IT WAS--SWUNG THIS STATUE AS A CLUB
HE MUST HAVE BEEN AT HER HOUSE AND SHE HAS ASKED HIM TO FOLLOW HER TO MAKE SURE NO HARM IS DONE
I'LL HAVE TO REPORT TO THE STATION DARCY POINTED TO THE TELEPHONE AND THE POLICEMAN SHOWING NO MORE THAN A PASSING INTEREST IN THE BODY AT WHICH HE GLANCED CASUALLY AS HE PASSED CALLED UP HIS PRECINCT AND REPORTED BEING TOLD TO REMAIN ON GUARD UNTIL RELIEVED
PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD SAID IT SO OFTEN AND WAS TIRED
HE HAS SOME BUN ON WHERESH MY PAPER CUTTER DARCY WENT ON KING SMILING IN A FASHION MEANT TO BE MERRY BUT WHICH WAS FIXED AND GLASSY AS TO HIS EYES
COME SPEAK UP YOU RASCAL WELL SAH COLONEL YO DONE TELL ME WHEN WE COME HEAH NOT T TROUBLE YO WIF ANY DETECTIVE NEWS BUT OH THAT WAS BEFORE I GOT MIXED UP IN THIS DARCY CASE SHAG
HARRY KING WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN GAMBLING THE NIGHT BEFORE THE GAME LASTING UNTIL NEARLY MORNING AND AT ONE STAGE WHEN KING WAS BROKE HE HAD EXCUSED HIMSELF GONE OUT INTO THE NIGHT ALONE AND HAD COME BACK WELL SUPPLIED WITH FUNDS
THE MORGUE KEEPER'S MEN LIFTED THE FAST STIFFENING BODY AND WERE ABOUT TO PLACE IT IN THE WICKER CARRIER WHEN CARROLL WHO WAS WATCHING THEM RATHER IDLY UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION
BUT MAYBE I'LL MAKE FOOLS OF SOME OF THESE FOLKS INSTEAD OF BEING MADE A FOOL OF MYSELF
I POSSIBLY IN MEMORY OF OTHER DAYS THE MAN SNEERED
DOC WARREN'S IN NOW GIVING HIM THE ONCE-OVER DID HE HAVE ANY VISITORS TO-DAY ASKED THE COLONEL
THUS HIS WAGGED TAIL HAD A DOUBLE MEANING SO TO SPEAK
IT'S SO--SO TUT TUT
AND THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ARGUE THAT HE PLANNED THIS TO MAKE HER INSENSIBLE FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES WHETHER IT WAS THAT HE DID IT IN A FIT OF PASSION TO KILL HER FOR HIS FANCIED TROUBLES OR TO COVER UP A ROBBERY
DID YOU TELL HIM WHERE THE BEST FISHING WAS ASKED THE COLONEL
YOU CAN DROP THAT CASE COLONEL DROP IT YES THE DIAMOND CROSS HAS BEEN RECOVERED
IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING HOW'D IT HAPPEN ASKED DONOVAN SHARPLY
CHET WITH A WHINE AND STRETCH INDICATING THAT HE WAS WARMED AND RESTED AND WOULD NOT OBJECT TO A LITTLE PLAY WALKED SLOWLY OVER TOWARD THE COLONEL
SPOTTY MORGAN ARRESTED HERE TO-DAY
SOBERED KING'S EXPLANATION WAS THAT A LADY HAD REALLY GIVEN HIM THE MONEY BUT WHO SHE WAS OR WHY SHE GAVE HIM FUNDS AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE WOULD NOT SAY
I MEAN HE'S GOING TO SMASH FINANCIALLY
DONOVAN ON THE INFORMATION BROUGHT IN BY A STOOL-PIGEON HAD MADE THE ARREST AND WAS JUBILANT THEREAT
I'LL PUT A NOTICE IN THE DOOR NOW AND DARCY WROTE OUT ONE WHICH A CLERK AFFIXED TO THE FRONT DOOR FOR HIM
SHE'S DEAF AND SHE'LL BE MORE OF A NUISANCE THAN A HELP
THE CROWD GREW LARGER
WHERE'S THAT RASCAL SHAG YES SAH COLONEL
PUTTING THEM ON HE TOOK THE WATCH FROM ITS TISSUE PAPER WRAPPINGS AND THEN HOLDING IT UNDER THE GLEAMING LIGHT ON HIS TABLE HE GAVE A TWIST TO THE CASE PRESSED ON A CERTAIN POINT IN THE RIM WITH THE END OF HIS LEAD PENCIL AND A TINY NEEDLE SHOT OUT INTO VIEW
CARROLL AND THONG WITH THE PROSECUTOR'S MEN WILL USE THIS FOR ALL IT IS WORTH
AND NOW THOSE WHITE FINGERS GRASPED COLD STEEL AND A KEEPER PASSING UP AND DOWN ON HIS HALF-HOURLY ROUNDS WONDERED GRIMLY IF THEY HAD BEEN STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF MRS DARCY
AND AFTER HE DIED AND CONFESSED WE FOUND A PAPER OF IMITATION DIAMONDS IN HIS POCKET THAT LARCH HAD READY TO USE IN DECEIVING HIS WIFE IF SHE HAD AGREED TO SIGN THE PAPERS HE WANTED HER TO SO HE COULD BOLSTER UP HIS FAILING BUSINESS WELL HE'S OUT OF THE WAY NOW AND I HEAR THE HOTEL HAS BEEN SOLD YES MR MASON
THEY WERE QUESTIONING DARCY IN THE LIVING-ROOM OF MRS DARCY'S SUITE THE CLERKS BEING DETAINED DOWNSTAIRS BY MULLIGAN
THE BOY STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK QUESTIONINGLY
CHAPTER V AMY'S APPEAL TINKLING GLASSES FORMED A FRIENDLY RAMPART BETWEEN COLONEL ASHLEY AND SPOTTY MORGAN
YOU SAVED ME FROM A HORRIBLE DEATH AND SAYING SO DOESN'T BEGIN TO THANK YOU OR TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN
BUT I CAME BACK
DON'T LET IT DISTRESS YOU
SPOTTY MORGAN
I IMAGINE THEY QUARRELED OVER THE POSSESSION OF THE WATCH AND SHERE ALI PERHAPS FORGETTING THE DEADLY NATURE OF IT OR KNOWING THE TIME MECHANISM WAS SET NOT TO GO OFF FOR SOME HOURS GRABBED IT AWAY FROM SINGA
MIND YOU JACK I'M MAKING NO STATEMENTS
IS THAT YOUR KNIFE HARRY KING DEMANDED THONG
GET KEDGE ON THE WIRE YES SAH COLONEL THE COLORED MAN WENT TO THE INSTRUMENT BUT BEFORE HE HAD ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF CENTRAL HIS MASTER CALLED
DID HE HOPE THAT SOME SPIRIT OF THE POOR MURDERED WOMAN MIGHT STILL BE LINGERING THERE TO WHISPER TO HIM WHAT HE SOUGHT TO LEARN
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
IF I HAD A STICK OR SOMETHING THAT I COULD FASTEN THE NEEDLE ON I COULD WORK A SORT OF JAVELIN REMARKED THE COLONEL
BUT NOW--WELL I'M THROUGH--THAT'S ALL MR KETTRIDGE REGARDED HIS COMPANION WITH AMAZEMENT
GO ON WITH YOUR THIRD DEGREE IF YOU WANT TO HE SNEERED
I WAS JEST COMIN IN OFF DOG-WATCH WHEN I HAPPENED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOIN ON HERE--THE CROWD AN EVERYTHIN I AIN'T GOIN TO STAY WELL PHONE IN THEN AND GET SOMEBODY ADVISED CARROLL TESTILY
THE THUD OF THE FEET OF THE MILKMEN'S HORSES WAS MUFFLED AND THE RATTLE OF BOTTLES SEEMED TO COME FROM AFAR OFF AS THOUGH OVER SOME MISTY LAKE
BUT HOW--HOW I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE MISS MASON CREDIT FOR A WHOLE LOT IN THIS MATTER BROKE IN KENNETH
I MUST ASK DARCY ABOUT THAT
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE BOY RETURNED AN ENVELOPE HELD CONSPICUOUSLY IN HIS HAND
SWIRLING WATERS XXII
BUT FOR A QUIET PLACE TO THINK GIVE ME A FISHING EXCURSION EVERY TIME
HERE'S SOME ONE TO SEE YOU AND THE PRESENTATION WAS QUICKLY AND INFORMALLY MADE
THE REST WILL HAVE TO BE AT THE MORGUE
IN FACT I THINK I CAN PERSUADE KING THAT IT WAS A HALF DOLLAR HE DROPPED AND SOMEWHAT TO THE SURPRISE OF MR KETTRIDGE THE COLONEL WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING KING AS THE LATTER SOUGHT ON THE FLOOR FOR HIS FALLEN COINS WALKED UP TO THE WASTRAL AND HANDED HIM A FIFTY-CENT PIECE
YES THE CHAP THAT'S WORKING WITH KENNETH ON THE DARCY CASE SEEN HIM
AS HE DESCENDED THE STEPS HE SILENTLY MUSED
LIKE TO TALK WITH EM ABOUT IT WENT ON THONG IN FRIENDLIER TONES
LOOK AT THE BLOOD I--I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT MURMURED DARCY FAINTLY
I COULDN'T QUITE CATCH WHICH WHAT SORT OF PRESENT JACK A DIAMOND CROSS WHAT AND THE COLONEL HAD SUDDENLY TO MODULATE HIS VOICE OR HE WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED MORE ATTENTION THAT HE CARED TO
SOME TERRIBLE THIEF--A BURGLAR--MUST HAVE KILLED MRS DARCY
SHE HAD SERVED THE OWNER OF THE JEWELRY STORE FOR MORE THAN A SCORE OF YEARS
OF COURSE JIMMIE BOY MURMURED AMY
SO WE LET HIM HAVE THE CIGARETTES
THE PLACE WAS IN CHARGE OF THOMAS KETTRIDGE A HALF UNCLE TO MRS DARCY
I'LL HAVE TO BE--HELD FALTERED DARCY
AS IT IS THAT'S JUST WHAT I HAVE NOT DONE
HER HEAD'S SMASHED EXCLAIMED CASEY
YOU WILL BEAR A LITTLE CLOSER WATCHING CHAPTER XVII A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW WELL REMARKED COLONEL ASHLEY BRISKLY TO HIMSELF THERE ARE TWO OR THREE THINGS I'VE GOT TO DO AND DO THEM RIGHT AWAY
I GOT ONE WARDEN
IT HAPPENED WHEN THE STORE WAS CROWDED AND MADE A BIT OF EXCITEMENT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD
THANK YOU DR WARREN
DARCY'S EYES BRIGHTENED THOSE OF THE OTHERS IN THE SAME TIER OF CELLS WITH HIM WHICH FOR THE MOMENT HAD LIGHTED UP GREW DULL AGAIN
I GUESS I MUST HAVE LEFT IT ON THE BED HE MURMURED
USUALLY THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH TO SMOKE HE DIDN'T EXACTLY WASTE THEM SAID THE COLONEL GRIMLY AS HE LOOKED AT THE DIVIDED BUT OTHERWISE PERFECT CIGARETTES IN HIS HAND
OH I HAVE THEM IN MY POCKET--THE HOOKS AND LINE AND THE COLONEL GRIMLY TAPPED A POCKET WHEREIN SOMETHING CLICKED METALLICLY
I'VE GOT IT WHAT CALLED KENNETH
THAT AIN'T OUR TEACHER'S NAME NO I SUPPOSE NOT AND THE COLONEL SMILED
IF THEY'RE HERE YES I THINK THEY JUST CAME IN SAID THONG BRINGING HIS FEET DOWN WITH A BANG FROM THE TABLE ON WHICH HE HAD HAD THEM ELEVATED
ANYTHING GONE FROM THE STORE HE ASKED DARCY
I DIDN'T DREAM YOU'D BE AFTER ME SO SOON FOR THE JOB I ONLY DONE LAST NIGHT
TOO BAD
MANY A TIME
THE MAN WENT INSIDE THE STATION BUT THE DETECTIVE DID NOT COME FROM HIS POST OF OBSERVATION
WELL COLONEL ASHLEY I'LL LEAVE THE CASE IN YOUR HANDS
DON'T YOU SO MUCH AS SCRATCH THE VARNISH ON THE TIP OF ONE OF MY RODS
YOU UNDERSTAND COLONEL THAT I AM TO GO ON THE STAND FOR THE PROSECUTION AND TELL ALL I KNOW ABOUT THIS CASE OH YES I REALIZE THAT OF COURSE
SOME TIME BEFORE THE EVENTS LEADING TO THE SEPARATION A MEETING BETWEEN HIS WIFE AND GRAFTON HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY ONE OF LARCH'S HOTEL EMPLOYEES WHO TOLD OF IT MAGNIFYING ITS IMPORTANCE
LANGFORD LARCH I ARREST YOU FOR THE MURDER OF MRS AMELIA DARCY IT WAS SO STILL FOR A MOMENT THAT THE RUSTLE OF A BIRD'S WINGS IN THE TREE OVERHEAD SOUNDED LIKE THE RUSHING OF WIND
QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS VERY FOND OF WATCHES AND CLOCKS AND HER FRIENDS KNOWING THAT USED TO PRESENT HER WITH BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS
TRY TO THINK--IT MAY MEAN A LOT TO YOU AND HE SPOKE EARNESTLY
WHAT ROAD'S HE TRAVEL ON HE DON'T TRAVEL
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT GETTING A POSTPONEMENT
I WONDER WHO HIS LADY FRIEND IS
THEN A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME OVER HIS FACE
THEN I CALLED IN THE MILKMEN I SAW THEM INTERRUPTED MULLIGAN
CERTAINLY YOU DID PUT ONE OVER ON ME NOT INTENTIONAL COLONEL
NOT AFTER ME COLONEL NO I CAME HERE FOR A QUIET BIT OF FISHING AND I JUST STUMBLED ON THIS CASE AGAINST MY WILL
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO RUIN JUST BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T STAND A LITTLE ROUGH TREATMENT NOW AND THEN
FAINTLY CAME FROM THE MAIMED THROAT A HOARSE WHISPER
COLONEL ASHLEY WHO HAD WORKED HIMSELF TO A POSITION WHERE HIDDEN BEHIND A SCREEN OF BUSHES HE COULD SEE AND HEAR WATCHED CLOSELY
WE MAY NEED IT BUT SUPPOSE KING GOES AWAY HE WON'T
HE'S THE KIND OF A FELLER THAT CAN'T HIDE VERY WELL UNLESS HE GOES AND KILLS HIMSELF AND HE MAY DO THAT HOW DID IT HAPPEN
THOUGH I DO OWN A STORE WHERE JEWELRY IS SOLD WE DON'T CARRY AN EXPENSIVE LINE
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET I BELIEVE
THERE AIN'T A MAN LIVIN THAT CAN
HE DOESN'T KNOW HE HAD IT--HE DOESN'T KNOW HE LOST IT--HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU HAVE IT
DON'T ANSWER
THE WIND SIGHED THROUGH THE TREES AND THE MURMUR OF THE RIPPLING WATER FILLED THE AIR
WHAT'S A FAMILY GOOD FOR ANYHOW AFTER YOU'RE GROWN UP
I'VE KNOWN HIM FROM A BOY SAID MR KETTRIDGE AND THOUGH HE HAS HIS FAULTS A CRIME SUCH AS THIS WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT MOTIVE SUCH AS THE DISPUTE OVER MONEY OR HIS SWEETHEART
NOW FOR A LAST GLIMPSE HE OPENED THE BOOK AND READ
NOW I WONDER WHETHER HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH--OR LYING
COULD YOUR APPARATUS HAVE DONE THAT NEVER
HAD ONE SWELL TIME THASH WHAT I DID
BUT THEY WERE NOT NEEDED WHY NOT BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE
YOU'VE GOT TO COME WITH US AND EXPLAIN A LITTLE ABOUT THIS KNIFE OF YOURS
THE WATCH THAT IS STILL TICKING YES BUT THE FUNNY PART OF IT IS THAT THE WATCH WASN'T GOING LAST NIGHT WHEN I PLANNED TO START WORK ON IT
KILLED I'M AFRAID
THE OLD FAMILIES--NOT THAT ANY OF THEM COULD TRACE THEIR ANCESTRY BACK VERY FAR--LIKED TO SAY THAT WE GET ALL OUR STUFF AT VAN DOREN'S THIS NAME ON LITTLE WHITE PLUSH-LINED BOXES CONTAINING PINS OR SPARKLING RINGS CAME TO MEAN ALMOST AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE NAMES IN NEW YORK
YOU FOLLOW KING AND I'LL TAKE THE TRAIL AFTER LARCH
THE OTHER MAN BRINGING HIS RATTLING VEHICLE TO A STOP FOLLOWED
HE WANTED TO BE SURE OF HIS GROUND BEFORE HE TOLD OF THIS END OF THE AFFAIR
WHAT'S THAT TICKING SOUND IT'S THE WATCH--IN HER HAND REPLIED DARCY AND HIS VOICE WAS A HOARSE WHISPER
WE CAN JUST TELL HIM WHAT WE SAW CASEY AND THEN SLIDE ALONG
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T TAKE UP YOUR CASE
SAID IT WAS AN ANCIENT TIMEPIECE WHICH HE HAD OWNED FOR MANY YEARS AND AS IT COULD HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE CRIME THEY LET HIM TAKE IT OH WELL I SUPPOSE THAT WAS ALL RIGHT
BUT I DONE BOUGHT IT FO MAHSE'F
OH FRIEND IZAAK HE MURMURED HOW BASELY I HAVE DESERTED YOU
SINGA PHUT FOR PURPOSES OF HIS OWN HAD THIS POISONED WATCH IN HIS POSSESSION
NOT SO HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF A STAB WOUND IN OR NEAR THE HEART
I'VE GOT TO BREAK YOU IF NEED BE SPOTTY TO GET AT THE TRUTH
I DARN'T SELL YOUR DIAMONDS--AT LEAST I DON'T WANT TO
AS FOR KING HE'S ASLEEP AND I GUESS WE CAN PUT HIM TO BED HERE
LOOK HERE SNARLED THE MAN WITH THE BROKEN WRIST AS HE CLASPED IT WITH HIS OTHER HAND AREN'T YOU HE STARTED BACK AS A LAST FLICKER OF THE WANING LIGHT FELL ACROSS THE COLONEL'S FACE
THERE WAS A SPLASH IN THE SUN A SHRILL SONG OF THE REEL AND A FISH LEAPED HIGH IN THE AIR TRYING TO SHAKE THE BARB FROM ITS MOUTH
YOU ARE PRACTICALLY A WITNESS AGAINST DARCY
IT BELONGS TO SINGA PHUT SINGA PHUT EJACULATED CARROLL
HE HAD DAT AR ANIMAL CASE OH YOU MEAN MR CAMPBELL'S YES SAH
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT EAST INDIAN SOMETHING ABOUT THAT QUEER WATCH DONOVAN WAS AT HEADQUARTERS IT BEING HIS NIGHT ON AND HE WELCOMED THE DETECTIVE AS SOME ONE WITH WHOM HE MIGHT HOLD CONVERSE
INSIDE THE CUT GLASS AND SILVER GLEAMED AS OF OLD BUT ON THE FLOOR SUNK DEEP IN THE GRAIN OF THE WOOD NOW WAS THE SPOT OF BLOOD--FIT TO KEEP COMPANY WITH THE RED RUBIES IN THE LOCKED SAFE
SIR YOU DID SAVE MY LIFE
ARE YOU PREPARED TO KEEP IT IF I WALK A WAY WITH YOU I AM
THE MAN ON WATER STREET GETS DRUNK AND BRINGS HIS WIFE HOME A QUART OF OYSTERS AS A PEACE OFFERING
YES I'LL GIVE THIS CASE UP HE WENT ON WITH A SIGH
TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT SAID THE COLONEL WHEN HE WAS SITTING WITH MR KETTRIDGE IN THE DIMLY-LIGHTED JEWELRY SHOP AFTER SALLIE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL
IT'S YOU
I'LL FOOL YOU ALL
DOC WARREN CAN TEND TO THAT END OF IT
BUT THIS DOOR TOO WAS LOCKED THOUGH THROUGH THE GLASS HE COULD SEE A LIGHT IN THE REAR ROOM
AFTER HE HAD TELEPHONED
IN ONE HAND SHE HELD THE INDIAN WATCH PERHAPS PICKED UP IDLY FROM THE REPAIR TABLE
HE SAW THE GLEAMING JEWELS IN THE SAFE
I'M TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN YOUR WORK
WELL WE'LL LEAVE THAT FOR THE COUNTY PHYSICIAN
BUT MISS BRILL THE YOUNG LADY CLERK RECEIVED AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK FROM SOME WIRES HIDDEN UNDER THE METAL EDGE OF ONE OF THE SHOWCASES SO MR KETTRIDGE SAYS AND SHE WAS KNOCKED DOWN KILLED NO BUT HER HEAD STRUCK ON THE EDGE OF A CASE AND SHE'S BADLY CUT
NOW YOU MUST OH STOP THE THEATRICAL BUSINESS HE SNEERED
EVERY MAN'S GOT TO EARN HIS BREAD AND BUTTER SOMEHOW
SO HE UP AND CONFESSED
DURING THEIR FINAL INTERVIEW SHE TOLD THE TRUTH OF HOW IT HAD BEEN STEPPED ON AND THAT GRAFTON HAD TAKEN IT TO BE REPAIRED
THE FINELY APPOINTED HOTEL KEPT BY LARCH CALLED THE HOMESTEAD FROM THE NAME OF AN OLD INN OF COLONIAL DAYS WHICH IT REPLACED WAS KNOWN FOR MILES AROUND
YOUNG LADIES COUNTED IT A POINT IN THE FAVOR OF THEIR LOVERS IF THE ENGAGEMENT CIRCLET CAME FROM VAN DOREN'S
THIS IS THE COLONEL
I--I OH AARON
OH MY GOD CUT OUT THAT HYSTERICAL STUFF HE ORDERED
THEN BUTTONING HIS COAT RATHER ASKEW ABOUT HIM TO GIVE A CARELESS AIR TO HIS ATTIRE THE COLONEL NORMALLY WAS ONE OF THE NEATEST MEN LIVING HE CROSSED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET AND THEN BECAME THE SHADOWER OF TWO INSTEAD OF ONE FOR AARON GRAFTON HAD PASSED ON WITHOUT APPARENTLY NOTICING HIM
WITH THEM AND THE BLACK BUTTS AS WELL AS THE BROKEN PAPER TUBES HE MOVED OVER TO THE SMALL TABLE IN THE CELL AND SPREAD THEM OUT
IT IS DOUBTFUL
I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT IN ONE OF THE SHOWCASES OR LAID ON THE SHELF PERHAPS FORGOTTEN
IF YOU SO MUCH AS BRING A PAPER INTO THIS ROOM I'LL SEND YOU BACK TO VIRGINIA WHERE YOU BELONG SHAG YES SAH COLONEL THE MILITARY-LOOKING DETECTIVE RESUMED HIS PACING OF THE ROOM HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS BACK CLASPING AND UNCLASPING NERVOUSLY
HE'D HAVE COME TO SEE YOU HIMSELF TO-DAY BUT I SAID I WANTED TO SEE YOU FIRST
IT'S THE ONLY GOOD ONE FOR TROUT AROUND HERE BESIDES THE ONE ON MY FATHER'S FARM HAS YOUR FATHER A TROUT STREAM AND THE EYES OF THE COLONEL TOOK ON A KINDLY GLEAM
