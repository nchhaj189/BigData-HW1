IT WAS ONE WITH THEM BY A NECESSARY SPIRITUAL INCLUSION
HOW THE INTENSE LOVE OF LIBERTY AND DESIRE TO GET BACK TO HIS MOTHER HAD UNCEASINGLY ABSORBED HIS MIND THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS OF BONDAGE
BECAUSE MR TYLER WAS A POOR MAN
I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT YOU WOULD LAUGH IF YOU WERE TO HEAR SOME OF THE REMARKS WHICH MY LECTURES CALL FORTH
SUBSTANTIALLY HER TESTIMONY ON THIS OCCASION WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE SUBJOINED AFFIDAVIT WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS STATE OF NEW YORK CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK
INDEED IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A MERCHANT LAWYER DOCTOR PLANTER OR MINISTER WHO WAS NOT TOO COMPLETELY INTERLINKED WITH SLAVERY TO BE RELIED UPON TO MANAGE A NEGOTIATION OF THIS NATURE
BUT THE LAND OF FREEDOM WAS A LESSON OF DEEPER SIGNIFICANCE THAN FOAMING WAVES OR TOWERING MOUNTS WHILE IN TORONTO SHE LECTURED AND WAS LISTENED TO WITH GREAT INTEREST

THE BUSINESS OF THIS FIRM OF MONTGOMERY SONS HAS AMOUNTED I UNDERSTAND TO BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A YEAR
INSTEAD OF GOING TO CANADA OSCAR AND HIS COMRADE PITCHED THEIR TENTS IN OSWEGO N.Y WHERE THEY CHANGED THEIR NAMES AND INSTEAD OF RETURNING THEMSELVES TO THEIR KIND MISTRESS THEY WERE WICKED ENOUGH TO BE PLOTTING AS TO HOW SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS MIGHT GET OFF ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE APPENDED LETTERS FROM OSCAR WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE SLUGGISH ETC
I WILL GIVE A REWARD OF FIFTY DOLLARS IF TAKEN OUT OF THE CITY AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IF TAKEN WITHIN THE CITY
I HAVE FOUND OUT WHOSE HE IS THE HUNTER SAID
FROM THE RECORD BOOK THE FOLLOWING BRIEF ACCOUNT IS TAKEN
JOE ELLIS
ARE YET WELL AND THAT MRS ARRAH WEEMS WILL START WITH ONE OF THEM FOR PHILADELPHIA TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY
IN 1855 A TRAVELER ARRIVED WITH THE ABOVE NAME WHO ON EXAMINATION WAS FOUND TO POSSESS VERY EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTERISTICS
STILL OF PHILADELPHIA ENTITLED THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD REFERRED TO IN MY LAST
HE HAD A WIFE AND FAMILY BUT HIS WIFE WAS NO BETTER THAN HE WAS WHEN CHARGES OR STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY FUGITIVES AGAINST THOSE FROM WHOM THEY ESCAPED PARTICULAR PAINS WERE TAKEN TO FIND OUT IF SUCH STATEMENTS COULD BE VERIFIED
AND YET I DO NOT REGRET THAT I HAVE ESPOUSED THIS CAUSE
HE FELT PRETTY WELL SATISFIED THAT IF PROVIDENCE WOULD AID HIM AND HE COULD GET A CONDUCTOR TO PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT ROAD TO CANADA HE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SADLY CONFUSED AND PUT TO SHAME HE HUNG ON TO THE LOST CAUSE TENACIOUSLY
WANZER FRANK ALIAS ROBT
BUT GREAT AS THEY WERE THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO SLAVERY NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM AND THE LONGER THEY STAYED IN THE WOODS THE GREATER WAS THEIR DETERMINATION TO BE FREE

JOHN WESLEY COULD PRAY FOR THEM AND WISH THEM WELL BUT NOTHING MORE
BENJAMIN PINEY REPORTED THAT HE CAME FROM BALTIMORE COUNTY MARYLAND WHERE HE HAD BEEN HELD IN SUBJECTION TO MARY HAWKINS
I NEVER THINK OF SUCH A THING NOW DON'T YOU KEEP LATE HOURS AT NIGHT AND SWEAR OCCASIONALLY NO SIR

THE TENDERNESS AND THOUGHTFULNESS OF HIS DISPOSITION ARE WELL SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT

HE NEVER WENT AWAY BUT WHAT HE WOULD COME HOME DRUNK AND IF ANY BODY MADE HIM ANGRY OUT FROM HOME HE WOULD COME HOME AND TAKE HIS SPITE OUT OF HIS PEOPLE HE OWNED THREE GROWN MEN TWO WOMEN AND SIX CHILDREN
THESE ILL OMENS AROUSED CAROLINE TO THINK MORE SERIOUSLY OVER THE CONDITION OF HERSELF AND CHILDREN THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE AND IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SHE WOULD STRIVE TO SAVE HERSELF AND CHILDREN BY FLIGHT ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HE THEN COMMENCED HIS DREARY JOURNEY ON FOOT--COLD AND HUNGRY--IN A STRANGE PLACE WHERE IT WAS QUITE UNSAFE TO MAKE KNOWN HIS CONDITION AND WANTS
THE ORDINARY DIFFICULTIES WERE EXPERIENCED BUT ALL WERE SURMOUNTED WITHOUT SERIOUS HARM
SHE REMAINED FOR A TIME IN THIS FAMILY AND WAS THEN FORWARDED TO ELMIRA
THE COMMITTEE IN NEW YORK WITH THE DOCTOR WERE ON THE LOOK OUT OF COURSE

EMELINE'S HUSBAND WAS NAMED JOHN HENRY
MOST OF THEM WERE MARRIED AND HAD WIVES AND CHILDREN CLINGING TO THEM IN THIS HOUR OF FEARFUL LOOKING FOR OF JUDGMENT

CHASKEY WAS VALUED AT $1200
NEEDING REST AND RECRUITING HE WAS MADE WELCOME TO STAY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COMMITTEE AS LONG AS HE MIGHT FEEL DISPOSED SO TO DO
IT WAS THE AUCTION-BLOCK HORROR THAT FIRST PROMPTED HIM TO SEEK FREEDOM
AN AIR OF TRUTHFULNESS HOWEVER WAS APPARENT
THE PRUDENCE AND FORESIGHT OF THOMAS SHIPLEY AND HIS FRIENDS HAD PROVIDED HOWEVER FOR THIS ANTICIPATED DIFFICULTY
HE SPOKE OF HIS MASTER AS A PRETTY BAD MAN WHO WAS ALWAYS QUARRELING AND WOULD DRINK SWEAR AND LIE LEFT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT ANYTHING FOR HIS LABOR ON TAKING HIS DEPARTURE FOR CANADA HE WAS CALLED UPON TO BID ADIEU TO HIS MOTHER AND THREE BROTHERS ALL UNDER THE YOKE

BY RECOGNIZING THE RIGHT OF ONE MAN TO BUY AND SELL OTHER MEN
THE FIRST IS FROM THE ABLE AND GRAPHIC PEN OF JAMES MILLER MCKIM WHO WAS WELL KNOWN TO STAND IN THE FRONT RANKS OF BOTH THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY AND THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAUSE THROUGH ALL THE LONG AND TRYING CONTEST DURING WHICH THE COUNTRY WAS AGITATED BY THE QUESTION OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION AND SHARED THE FULL CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT OF ABOLITIONISTS OF ALL CLASSES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN
FOR FEW MEN HAVE SO LARGE A WEALTH IN THE BLESSINGS OF THE POOR AND THE GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF KINDNESS AND BENEVOLENCE AS HE THE NEW YORK TIMES CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING

BETWEEN IT AND THE HOUSE A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE PATH BUT IN PLAIN SIGHT STOOD THE CARRIAGE-HOUSE WHICH THEY PASSED BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO NOTICE
AT THIS POINT A CONSCIENTIOUS REGARD FOR TRUTH DICTATES THAT I SHOULD STATE THAT MY DISPOSITION TO MAKE A SACRIFICE FOR THE REMOVAL OF DORSEY AND SOME OTHER LEADING SPIRITS WAS AIDED BY MY OWN DESIRE FOR SELF-PRESERVATION I KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN ASSERTED FAR DOWN IN THE SLAVE REGION THAT SMITH WHIPPER THE NEGRO LUMBER MERCHANTS WERE ENGAGED IN SECRETING FUGITIVE SLAVES

ENEMIES OF WAR WE MOST HEARTILY WISH AND DOUBT NOT THAT YOU WISH AS HEARTILY AS WE DO THAT THIS DELIVERANCE COULD HAVE BEEN WROUGHT OUT BY PEACEFUL MEANS
THE EFFORT FOR PARDON WAS SOON ABANDONED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON GIVEN BY THE GOVERNOR
THE KINDNESS OF THESE FRIENDS MANIFESTED BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO ANYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO ADD TO THE COMFORT OF CHARLES WAS PROOF TO HIM THAT HIS EFFORTS AND SUFFERINGS HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER IN VAIN
BARNABY WAS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE MULATTO MEDIUM SIZE AND INTELLIGENT--HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE DARK GOOD-LOOKING AND OF PLEASANT APPEARANCE

I INTENDED TO HAVE GONE THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA BUT THE RISK GOING UP THE OHIO RIVER HAS CAUSED ME TO GO TO CANADA
BUT THIS PARTY WAS PECULIAR
TEN YEARS IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR HAVING A COPY OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN
A NUMEROUS PARTY LIKE THIS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BUSINESS
IT WOULD BE A SORROWFUL FACT IF SUCH A HERO AS SHE SHOULD BE LOST FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SCARCELY HAD SHE REACHED HER MAJORITY ERE SHE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF PROSE AND POETIC PIECES WHICH WERE DEEMED OF SUFFICIENT MERIT TO PUBLISH IN A SMALL VOLUME CALLED FOREST LEAVES SOME OF HER PRODUCTIONS FOUND THEIR WAY INTO NEWSPAPERS AND ATTRACTED ATTENTION

SHE HAD ONLY LEFT ONE BOY IN THE SOUTH WHO HAD BEEN SOLD FAR AWAY WHERE SHE SCARCELY EVER HEARD FROM HIM INDEED NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ANY MORE
BEING MINDFUL OF THE GREAT DANGER OF THE HOUR THERE WAS FELT TO BE MORE OCCASION JUST THEN FOR ANXIETY AND WATCHFULNESS THAN FOR CHEERING AND HURRAHING OVER THE BRAVE PASSENGERS
I CANNOT SAY THAT I LEFT FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN TO GET MY FREEDOM AS I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN USED AS WELL AS ANY SLAVE IN THE DISTRICT
HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF SLAVERY TO SATISFY HIM THAT HE COULD NEVER RELISH IT

THIS ARGUMENT WAS REGARDED BY THE COMMITTEE AS LOGICAL AND UNANSWERABLE
BUT HE AT ONCE RESOLVED TO STRIKE THAT DAY FOR FREEDOM--NOT TO GO HOME THAT EVENING TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF HIS NEW MASTER

SHE STOOPS FROM HEAVEN TO RAISE THE FALLEN TO BIND UP THE BROKEN-HEARTED TO RELEASE THE OPPRESSED TO GIVE LIBERTY TO THE CAPTIVE AND TO BREAK THE FETTERS OF THOSE THAT ARE BOUND

IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT SHE ALSO POSSESSED GREAT PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AS AN ARTICLE OF MUCH VALUE IN THE EYE OF A TRADER
HER BUSINESS IS TO GET WORK WHEREVER SHE CAN

MR FREEMAN PASTOR OF A COLORED CHURCH IN BROOKLYN AGREED TO ACCOMPANY HER TO HER UNCLE BROWN'S IN CANADA WEST AND WE SAW THEM DEPART KNOWING THE DANGER THAT WOULD BESET BOTH ON THE WAY
HE WAS A HERO IN A LIFE-TIME FIGHT AN UPRIGHT HONEST MAN IN HIS DEALINGS WITH MEN A TENDER HUSBAND A LOVING FATHER AND ABOVE ALL A MAN WHO LOVED HIS NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUTH BETTER THAN EASE SAFETY OR WORLDLY GOODS AND WHO NEVER LET ANY FEAR OF HARM TO PERSON OR PROPERTY SWAY HIM FROM DOING HIS WHOLE DUTY TO THE UTTERMOST
HE WAS A DOCTOR CIRCULATED HIGH AMONGST SOUTHERNERS THOUGH HE NEVER LIVED AGREEABLY WITH HIS WIFE WOULD CURSE HER AND CALL HER ALL KINDS OF NAMES THAT HE SHOULD NOT CALL A LADY
DO ANY TIDINGS REACH YOU OF OUR FRIEND FREDERICK DOUGLASS
I WAS OVERSEER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS FOR HIM
ROBERT BELL AND TWO OTHERS
GOOD I SUPPOSE YOU SMOKE AND CHEW AT ANY RATE NO NEITHER
WILLIAM STREETS COMMITTED THE WHOLE PARTY AS FUGITIVES FROM SLAVERY WHILE THE HUSBAND SAMUEL WAS A FREE MAN
BANKS JIM 487
J13-W&S3W ROBERT WAS TOO SHREWD TO BE ENTRAPPED BY THE ABOVE REWARD
SLAVERY GREW BLACKER AND BLACKER UNTIL HE RESOLVED TO PULL UP STAKES UPON A VENTURE
HE ALWAYS SPOKE OF THEE MY FRIEND VERY KINDLY AND ONE DAY WHEN SOME MONEY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM FOR FUGITIVES SAID
HE IS 36 YEARS OLD 6 FEET HIGH OF DARK BROWN COMPLEXION VERY HIGH FOREHEAD IS A LITTLE BALD AND IS INCLINED TO STOOP IN THE SHOULDERS
THIS FALL HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO TAKE FOUR OF MY OLDEST CHILDREN AND TWO OTHER SERVANTS TO VICKSBURG
THE SALE OF THEIR CHILDREN SIX IN NUMBER
I HAD MEN WAITING TILL 12 O'CLOCK TILL THE CAPTAIN ARRIVED AT HIS BERTH READY TO RECEIVE THEM
THE OFFICERS SENT THERE AT THE INSTANCE OF THE PROPER AUTHORITIES ARE MAKING DILIGENT SEARCH IN EVERY DIRECTION AND SECURING EVERY PERSON AGAINST WHOM THE LEAST SUSPICION IS ATTACHED

SHE GOT TO THE FALLS ON SAT'DY AND I WENT AFTER HER ON MONDAY
MR BRADLEY INTENDED TO SEND FOR HER PARENTS AND HOPED TO PREVAIL ON THEM TO COME AND LIVE WITH HIM
AND SAID WARRANTS SHALL RUN AND BE EXECUTED BY SAID OFFICERS ANYWHERE IN THE STATE WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE ISSUED
IN THE MIDST OF THE POPULAR COMMOTIONS AND TUMULTS WHICH MARKED THE PROGRESS OF ANTI-SLAVERY PRINCIPLES HE STOOD CALM AND UNMOVED
IT WILL BE FORWARDED BY OUR VALUED AND MUTUAL FRIEND H.H
IF THEY COULD LAY QUIET FOR TEN DAYS OR TWO WEEKS THEY MIGHT THEN GET UP SAFE
NONE OTHER THAN THE USUAL TRYING AND HAZARDOUS WAYS COULD BE DEVISED--WHICH WAS EITHER TO BE STOWED AWAY IN THE HOLD OF A SCHOONER OR CONCEALED AMONGST THE RUBBISH OF A STEAMER WHERE FOR THE TIME BEING THE EXTREME SUFFERING WAS SURE TO TAX EVERY NERVE EVEN OF THE MOST VALIANT-HEARTED MEN
RESPECTFULLY YOURS M.A.H
THINKING THAT MR BEANS HAD ALWAYS STOOD TO HIS WORD I WAS OVER PERSUADED AND CAME BACK
BEFORE HAVING TIME FOR MAKING INQUIRY SOME ONE SAID THEY HAD GONE ON BOARD THE BOAT
IN DUE TIME HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ON THE STEAMER BUT HE SOON LEARNED THAT HER COURSE WAS NOT DIRECT TO PHILADELPHIA BUT THAT SOME STAY WOULD BE MADE IN NORFOLK VA
THOUGH THEY SUCCEEDED IN GAINING THEIR OWN LIBERTY--THEY WERE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE OPPRESSION OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES LEFT IN BONDAGE
AT FIRST THEY TRAVELED ON FOOT
ARRIVAL 11TH
CHEERS I COMMENCED THE PUBLICATION OF THE LIBERATOR IN BOSTON ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY 1831
ACCORDINGLY HE RESOLVED TO BE FREE OR DIE TO KILL OR BE KILLED IN TRYING TO REACH FREE LAND SOMEWHERE HAVING ALWAYS BEEN HIRED OUT AMONGST VERY HARD WHITE PEOPLE HE WAS UNHAPPY HIS OWNER GEORGE COLEMAN LIVED NEAR FAIRFAX VA AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH BUT IN HIS WAYS WAS VERY SLY AND DEADLY AGAINST ANYTHING LIKE FREEDOM HE HELD FIFTEEN OF HIS FELLOW-MEN IN CHAINS
MISTRESS WAS A SPARE WOMAN TOLERABLY TALL AND VERY KIND EXCEPT WHEN SICK SHE WOULD NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION THEN
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW WE OUGHT TO FEEL IN OUR TRIALS AND WANTS TO SUCH KIND FRIENDS AS YOU
AFTER A FULL ARGUMENT IN WHICH A MANUMISSION WAS PRODUCED FOR NANCY FROM R.D
A.W.M
THEY USUALLY TARRY WITH US ONLY DURING THE NIGHT AND ARE FORWARDED TO CANADA BY THE MORNING TRAIN
I AM ASSURED THEY ARE SUCH AS CAN TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEMSELVES
DEPEE JACOB C
HE WAS A BIG BAD MAN NO GOODNESS IN HIM QUICKLY REPLIED ONE OF THE BROTHERS
IN CASUALLY REFERRING TO THE MANNER OF HIS TRAVELING HE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT VERY WELL AND AS IT HAD BEEN A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME SINCE HE HAD BEEN THROUGH THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY HE THOUGHT THAT THE DRIVE WOULD DO HIM GOOD AND ESPECIALLY THE SIGHT OF OLD FAMILIAR PLACES AND PEOPLE
ESTHER MOORE WAS NOT RICH IN THIS WORLD'S GOODS BUT WAS PURELY BENEVOLENT AND RICH IN GOOD WORKS TOWARDS HER FELLOW-MEN HATING EVERY FORM OF OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE AND AN UNCOMPROMISING WITNESS AGAINST PREJUDICE ON ACCOUNT OF COLOR
BOTH WERE COMFORTED BY STRONG FAITH IN GOD AND BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD ENABLE THEM TO HOLD OUT ON THE ROAD UNTIL THEY SHOULD REACH FRIENDS
BUT FEW COULD TELL OF HAVING BEEN EYE-WITNESSES TO OUTRAGES MORE REVOLTING AND DISGRACEFUL THAN WASHINGTON SOMLOR

IT IS ONE WE MADE FOR THEM 7 IN MARCH AFTER THE LIONS HAD THEM THERE IS NO BETTER IN THE STATE WE ARE 7 MILES FROM DELAWARE BAY
FROM THE CHRISTIAN UNION N.Y THE NARRATIVES THEMSELVES TOLD WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND DIRECTNESS OF OBVIOUS TRUTH ARE FULL OF TERROR OF PATHOS THE SHAME OF HUMAN BASENESS AND THE GLORY OF HUMAN VIRTUE
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WAS EVER MORE CONQUERED BY THE COLD THAN I HAD BEEN AT THAT HOUSE AND I HAVE LIVED PARTS OF WINTER AFTER WINTER AMID THE SNOWS OF NEW ENGLAND
1872 PHILADELPHIA
I DO NOT THINK MASTER WILLIAM WOULD CHEAT ME I ASSURED HIM THAT HE WOULD CHEAT HIM AND THAT THE OFFER WAS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOT ONLY GETTING THE TWO OLDER BOYS FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT HIS WIFE AND OTHER CHILDREN TO THE OFFICE WHEN ALL OF THEM WOULD BE TAKEN TOGETHER TO THE JAIL IN NEW CASTLE
AMERICAN HISTORY WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME SUCH BOOK AS THIS WRITTEN BY ONE WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THOSE DEVOTED PHILANTHROPISTS WHO WERE SO FEARLESS AND UNREMITTING IN THEIR EFFORTS FOR HUMAN FREEDOM
MISS WATKINS IS DOING GREAT GOOD IN OUR PART OF THE STATE
AGAIN THEY DECIDED TO STRIKE FOR FREEDOM BUT WHERE TO GO SAVE TO THE WOODS THEY HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
WHILE I AM IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE YET I KNOW THAT THE COLORED MAN NEEDS SOMETHING MORE THAN A VOTE IN HIS HAND
IT IS TOU MUCH FOR OUR LITTEL HORSES
ALFRED WAS TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE
I NEVER CARED TO KNOW PRECISELY HOW MANY STRIPES WERE INFLICTED ON THE SLAVES

I FIRST KNEW HER AT DOWNINGTOWN WHEN SHE CAME TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE
BROWN J.R
BUT IN MANY OF THESE CASES WE CAN RENDER NO AID WHATEVER
PICTURE TO THE MIND'S EYE THIS REMARKABLE PROCESSION OF NEARLY THREE THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FLEEING FROM SLAVERY AND FINDING IN THIS BRAVE LARGE-HEARTED MAN A FRIEND EQUAL TO THEIR NEEDS IN SO CRITICAL AN EMERGENCY
HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THE FARMING BUSINESS AND HAD OWNED QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF SLAVES BUT FROM TIME TO TIME HE HAD BEEN SELLING OFF UNTIL HE HAD REDUCED HIS STOCK CONSIDERABLY
AFTER THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HOWEVER FOR A SHORT TIME THE ATTORNEY FOR THE DEFENDANTS DISCOVERED A DEFECT IN THE TESTIMONY ON THIS POINT
WRIGHT OF YORK SULPHUR SPRINGS PA IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT BY WRITING TO YOU I MAY GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION OF SOME PROPERTY FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO YOUR CITY OR VICINITY
SHE WAS IN THE CONDITION OF A MARRIED WOMAN WHEN SHE LEFT ME
THAT SYSTEM WHICH REDUCES TWO MILLIONS AND A HALF OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN YOUR MIDST TO THE MOST ABJECT CONDITION OF IGNORANCE AND VICE WITHHOLDING FROM THEM THE VERY KEY OF KNOWLEDGE
THE DOCTORS WANTED HIM TO ATTEND THEIR PATIENTS MOSTLY SLAVES WHILE IN GEORGIA HE WAS FREQUENTLY ASKED WHERE HE CAME FROM BEING FOUND MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE COMMON RUN OF SLAVES

ROBERT BRENT ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF MARYLAND
THE FARE OF THE FOUR COST $240 AND WILLIAM WAS ONLY TOO GRATEFUL TO THINK THAT A CAPTAIN COULD BE FOUND WHO WOULD RISK HIS OWN LIBERTY IN THUS AIDING A SLAVE TO FREEDOM
AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT SESSION DEVISING EVERY LEGAL METHOD TO BAFFLE THE PURSUING BLOODHOUNDS AND RELIEVE THE CITY OF THEIR HATEFUL PRESENCE

JOHN HILLIS WAS A TILLER OF THE GROUND UNDER A WIDOW LADY MRS LOUISA LE COUNT OF THE NEW MARKET DISTRICT MARYLAND
STILL:--OUR FRIENDS IN CINCINNATI HAVE FAILED FINDING ANYBODY TO ASSIST ME ON MY RETURN
I HAVE LONG BEEN WANTING TO WRITE TO YOU BUT I ENTIRELY FORGOT THE NUMBER OF YOUR HOUSE MR DUNGY LUCKILY HAPPENED TO HAVE YOUR DIRECTIONS WITH HIM
CONSIDERING IT WORTH SAVING SIMPLY AS A RELIC OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IT WAS CAREFULLY LAID ASIDE
BUT UNTO HIM IT WAS GIVEN TO ENTER INTO THE PROMISED LAND TOWARD WHICH HE HAD SET HIS FACE PERSISTENTLY AND ALMOST ALONE FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO MAKE AN ADVENTURE AFTER MY FAMILY AND I WANT TO GET AN ANSWER FROM YOU AND THEN I SHALL KNOW HOW TO ACT AND THEN I WILL SEND TO YOU ALL PARTICULARS RESPECTING MY STARTING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE
HILL WAS IN THE HABIT OF WRITING ALWAYS GAVE HER MUCH PLEASURE TO PERUSE
HAILING ON THE STREET A CERTAIN COLORED MAN WITH A FAMILIAR FACE WHO HE THOUGHT KNEW NEARLY ALL THE COLORED PEOPLE ABOUT TOWN HE RELATED TO HIM THE PREDICAMENT OF HIS LADY FRIEND FROM THE SOUTH REMARKED HOW KINDLY SHE HAD ALWAYS TREATED HER SERVANTS SIGNIFIED THAT CORDELIA WOULD RUE THE CHANGE AND BE LEFT TO SUFFER AMONG THE MISERABLE BLACKS DOWN TOWN THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
OUR SCHOOL WAS NOT ONLY ANTI-SLAVERY BUT AVOWEDLY ANTI-CASTE
WITHOUT SERIOUS DIFFICULTY HE REACHED THE THICKET AND WHILE PONDERING OVER THE ALL-ABSORBING MATTER AS TO HOW HE SHOULD EVER MANAGE TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE AN OLD MAN APPROACHED
OVER SWIFTLY I WOULD HAVE WROTE BEFORE BUT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NOT PERMIT ME MISS SANDERS AND ALL THE FRIENDS DESIRED TO BE REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY I SHALL BE PLEASED TO HEAR FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD OFTEN
SHE CHANGED HER NAME TO CHARITY AND SUCCEEDED IN AGAIN JOINING HER HUSBAND BUT ALAS WITH THE HEART-BREAKING THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO LEAVE HER TWO LITTLE BOYS IN SLAVERY AND ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS ON THE ROAD FOR THE FATHER TO GO BACK AFTER
MR MCMURTRIE REPLIED BY REASSERTING HIS POSITIONS
IN TEMPER JUST LIKE HIS FATHER THOUGH HE DID NOT DRINK--THAT IS ALL THE GOOD QUALITY THAT I CAN RECOMMEND IN HIM JOHN SAID ALSO THAT HIS MASTER ON ONE OCCASION IN A MOST TERRIBLY ANGRY MOOD THREATENED THAT HE WOULD WADE UP TO HIS KNEES IN HIS JOHN'S BLOOD IT SO HAPPENED THAT JOHN'S BLOOD WAS UP PRETTY HIGH JUST AT THAT TIME
IN 1853 MY FREEDOM WAS PROMISED
THOSE TWO I WROTE ABOUT TO BE WITH THEE LAST 7TH DAY EVENING I PRESUME THEE HAS SEEN BEFORE THIS
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS POINT THE STORY OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHICH IS NOW TO BE RELATED WILL AFFORD THE MOST STRIKING PROOF
SENATOR FROM MASS THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD HAS PERFORMED ITS PART BUT MUST ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED GRATEFULLY AS ONE OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY
ON HIS DEATH-BED HE WOULD CALL PERSONS TO HIM WHO NEEDED SUCH ADVICE AND ADMONISH THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF USING STRONG DRINKS AND HIS LAST EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN ANY HUMANITARIAN MOVEMENT WAS AN AVOWAL OF HIS BELIEF IN THE GREAT GOOD TO ARISE FROM A PROHIBITORY LIQUOR LAW
OF MRS CARROLL HE SPEAKS IN VERY GRATEFUL TERMS SAYING THAT SHE WAS KIND TO HIM AND ALL THE SERVANTS AND PROMISED THEM THEIR FREEDOM AT HER DEATH
I JUST HAPPENED TO HEAR OF THIS NEWS IN TIME
ONE MORNING ABOUT THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER IN 1855 THE SLEEPY SLAVE-HOLDING NEIGHBORHOOD OF CHESTERTOWN MARYLAND WAS DOUBTLESS DEEPLY EXCITED ON LEARNING THAT ELEVEN HEAD OF SLAVES FOUR HEAD OF HORSES AND TWO CARRIAGES WERE MISSING
WHEN WORKING IN THE KITCHEN DURING THE WINTER HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW PHEBE WRIGHT TO PERFORM ANY HARD LABOR ALWAYS SCRUBBING THE FLOOR AND LIFTING HEAVY BURDENS FOR HER
FOR SEVERAL YEARS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HIRE HIS TIME FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO PAY $10 PER MONTH

JOHN HUNN
DAVIS BREATHED THAT INTO HIS EAR
IT WAS VERY APPARENT THAT IT WAS NOT A CUT AND DRIED SPEECH FOR SHE WAS AS FLUENT AND AS FELICITOUS IN HER ALLUSIONS TO CIRCUMSTANCES IMMEDIATELY AROUND HER AS SHE WAS WHEN SHE ROSE TO A MORE EXALTED PITCH OF LAUDATION OF THE UNION OR OF EXECRATION OF THE OLD SLAVERY SYSTEM
THE THIRD TIME ANTHONY WAS SHOT HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE
THIS RETICENCE ROBERT UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN THAT SHE WAS STILL UNCONVERTED ON THIS GREAT CARDINAL PRINCIPLE AT LEAST
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY RESIGNED HIS PLACE IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY BELIEVING THAT THAT ORGANIZATION WAS NEAR THE END OF ITS USEFULNESS
HE IS THE SCOUNDREL THAT WAS TO HAVE CHARGE OF THE 7 I WROTE YOU ABOUT TWO WEEKS SINCE
18 1851
FRANCES ASSISTED HER HUSBAND TO ESCAPE FROM HIS OWNER--TAITS--AND WAS NEVER CONTENTED UNTIL SHE SUCCEEDED IN FOLLOWING HIM TO CANADA
IT IS NOT FORTY YEARS AGO I BELIEVE ABOUT THE YEAR 1829 WHEN THE GUEST WHOM WE HONOR THIS MORNING WAS SPENDING HIS SOLITARY DAYS IN A PRISON IN THE SLAVE-OWNING CITY OF BALTIMORE
ALFRED COOKMAN OF GRACE M.E
RATTLE-BRAINED
AND IN WITNESS OF ITS TRUTH I SKETCH THE GENERAL COURSE OF HIS LIFE THAT THROUGH IT WE MAY FIND THOSE ELEMENTS OF HIS CHARACTER WHICH INTUITIVELY RANGED HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE SLAVE
ONE YEAR'S STUDY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT HER
IS THAT YOU
MRS DICK HAD RESIDED A LONG TIME IN GEORGETOWN BUT OWNED THREE LARGE PLANTATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OVER WHICH SHE KEPT THREE OVERSEERS TO LOOK AFTER THE SLAVES
HE HAD ALREADY SOLD SOME OF THE SLAVES AND OTHERS--HE AMONG THEM--WERE EXPECTING TO BE SOLD BEFORE COMING INTO POSSESSION OF THEIR FREEDOM
THIS TRAVELER ARRIVED FROM MILLSBORO INDIAN RIVER DELAWARE WHERE HE WAS OWNED BY WM
THEREFORE HE REMAINED IN FREEDOM
AND IN PUBLIC DEBATE IN THE HALLS OF PEACE AND EVEN ON THE BLOOD-SOILED FIELDS OF WAR MY HEART HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH THOSE WHO WERE THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM
THE COLONIZATION SOCIETY HELD OUT A GOOD HOPE
WRITE ME SOON AND BELIEVE ME YOUR OBEDIENT SERV'T LOVE RESPECTS TO LADY AND DAUGHTER JOSEPH ROBINSON
HOWEVER THE NEXT MORNING HE HAPPENED TO SEE HER BY THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AND IN HER WORKING GARMENTS WHICH SATISFIED HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN GROSSLY DECEIVED
I AM NOW FIFTY-THREE YEARS OLD BUT I WELL REMEMBER THY FACE IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE IN FIFTH STREET WHEN I CALLED ON BUSINESS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
MY OLD MISTRESS NAME WAS NANCY SYDAN
I HAVE NOT FALLEN INTO THE FASHIONABLE CUSTOMS OF YOUNG MEN MISS BROWN WHO HAD BEEN AN ATTENTIVE LISTENER REMARKED
ITS CHIEF MERIT OF COURSE CONSISTS IN ITS EXTRAORDINARY REVELATIONS OF THE INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY OF THE DEAD SYSTEM OF SLAVERY BUT IT IS GRATIFYING TO NOTICE THAT IT WILL BE PRINTED AND SENT FORTH TO THE WORLD IN SO COMPLETE AND ADMIRABLE A STYLE I COMMEND IT MOST CHEERFULLY AS A BOOK THAT EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD HAVE IN HIS LIBRARY VERY TRULY YOURS JNO
I DON'T SAY THAT MUCH LIBERTY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO CONSTABLES ON ACCOUNT OF NUMEROUS RUNAWAYS BUT IT DON'T ALWAYS WORK FOR GOOD BEFORE ADVERTISING THEY GO ROUND AND OFFER REWARDS TO SHARP COLORED MEN OF PERHAPS ONE OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BETRAY RUNAWAYS AND HAVING DISCOVERED THEIR HIDING-PLACE SEIZE THEM AND THEN CHEAT THEIR INFORMERS OUT OF THE MONEY
WITHIN ONE DAY OF THE TIME FIXED FOR HIS SALE HE WAS HANDCUFFED AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SECURE
HER MASTER CAUGHT HER AND TOOK HER BACK WITH HIM INTO SLAVERY
SAMUEL ELLIS
BOY WOULD CERTAINLY START FOR THIS PLACE NOT RICHMOND IN TWO OR THREE DAYS THOUGH THE DIFFICULTY ABOUT FREIGHT MIGHT CAUSE DELAY AND THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE MIGHT NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER TEN DAYS C C
TWO OF THEM FENTON AND TOM WERE CONCEALED AT WILLIAM WRIGHT'S AND THE OTHER TWO SAM AND ONE WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN AT JOEL WIERMAN'S
I NOTICED HIS RESTLESSNESS AND FREQUENT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW FRONTING THE ROAD
AND IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO SAY THAT MESSRS
HER LONGEST AND PROBABLY HER NOBLEST WORK WAS DONE IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE
A ROOM AND COMFORTS HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
AFTER COMPLETING SUCH ARRANGEMENTS AS HE DEEMED NECESSARY HE STARTED MAKING HIS WAY ALONG PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SEVERE ENCOUNTER WITH JACK FROST BY WHICH HIS FEET WERE BADLY BITTEN
YET IT WAS SADLY OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD BEEN BLIGHTED AND CURSED BY SLAVERY EVEN IN ITS MILDEST FORMS
THEY CAME FROM HAVEN MANOR MD
EVERY FERRELL THAT LIVES IS DOWN ON SLAVES
THE FOLLOWING SAYS THE CHRONOTYPE IS A VERBATIM ET LITERATIM COPY OF THE LETTER SENT BY KNIGHT TO CRAFT TO ENTICE HIM TO THE U.S
THE BODY FINALLY REACHED ITS DISTRESSED HOME FOR INTERMENT
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FURNISHES A CLEW TO HIS WHEREABOUTS PLANS ETC
SO HE LOOKED SERIOUSLY INTO THE MATTER OF MASTER AND SLAVE AND PRETTY SOON RESOLVED THAT IF OTHERS CHOSE TO MAKE NO EFFORT TO GET AWAY FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD NEVER BE CONTENTED UNTIL HE WAS FREE
LEE JOHN EDWARD 500
NICKLESS TEMPLEMAN WAS THE LOSER IN THIS INSTANCE
GREEN ALLOWED HER TO HIRE HERSELF FOR THE SAME AMOUNT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT FRANCES SHOULD FIND ALL HER OWN CLOTHES BOARD HERSELF AND FIND HER OWN HOUSE TO LIVE IN
DAVID SNIVELY RAN AWAY FROM FREDERICK MARYLAND
THE FREEDOM OF THE HUSBAND AND FATHER WAS HOWEVER STILL IN JEOPARDY
A DAY OF VENGEANCE WILL COME AND THAT SOON

A LITTLE MORE FOLDING OF THE HANDS TO MY MORAL DEATH-SLEEP
SHE STOOD VERY HIGH BOTH AS A CHURCH COMMUNICANT AND A LADY IN SOCIETY
THE JURY HAVING BEEN SWORN IN THE BATTLE COMMENCED IN GOOD EARNEST AND CONTINUED UNABATED FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS
BUT SHE BROKE DOWN UNDER HER MOURNFUL FATE AND WENT TO THAT BOURNE FROM WHENCE NO TRAVELER EVER RETURNS
ABOUT NOON MEN WERE HEARD TALKING AROUND THE BARN
DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THAT SOCIETY'S EXISTENCE HE WAS A MEMBER OF IT
CHARLES WAS HELD BY JAMES RODGERS SR UNDER WHOM HE SAID THAT HE HAD SERVED NINE YEARS WITH FAINT PROSPECTS OF SOME TIME BECOMING FREE BUT WHEN WAS DOUBTFUL
AS THE FRIENDS ALLUDED TO WERE ABOUT TAKING MEASURES TO START A COLLEGE AT HARPER'S FERRY ESPECIALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FREEDMEN THEY ANTICIPATED MAKING THIS LATITUDE THE FIELD OF HIS FUTURE ENDEAVORS AT LEAST FOR A TIME
I CAME BY THE WAY OF SYRACRUSE REMEMBER ME TO MRS LOGINS TEL HER TO WRIT BACK TO MY BROTHERS WIFE IF SHE IS LIVING AND TEL HER TO COM ON TEL HER TO SEND JOSEPH ANDERSONS LOVE TO HIS MOTHER
HE UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL HOW SADLY SLAVERY HAD WRONGED HIM BY KEEPING HIM IN IGNORANCE AND POVERTY
NATHAN LISTENED TO THE PROPOSAL AND WAS SUDDENLY CONVERTED TO FREEDOM AND THE TWO UNITED DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK 1854 AND SET OUT ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HOW MY HEART EXPANDED IN LOVE TO HIM AS HE TOLD ME HIS ADVENTURES HIS TRIALS HIS TOILS HIS FEARS AND HIS HOPES
JACOB WAS OF A DARK HUE A LITTLE BELOW MEDIUM STATURE
IN NORTH CAROLINA HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD BEEN HEAVILY OPPRESSED BY BEING COMPELLED TO PAY $175 PER ANNUM FOR HIS HIRE
I GOT ME A DAGGER AND MADE UP MY MIND IF THEY ATTEMPTED TO TAKE ME ON THE ROAD I WOULD HAVE ONE MAN
GIVE MY LOVE TO FLORENCE
I WISH TO SAY TO YOU DEAR SIR THAT I EXPECT MY CLOTHES WILL BE SENT TO DR LANDA AND I WISH IF YOU PLEASE GET THEM AND SEND THEM TO THE CARE OF MR LOGUEN AT SYRACUSE FOR ME HE WILL BE IN POSSESSION OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND WILL SEND THEM TO ME
THE IMPRESSION MADE ON MR BIGELOW'S MIND MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING LETTER

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PAPERS WILL SAY TO-DAY
SOUTHERN MERCHANTS ESPECIALLY AVOIDED THEM AND WHEN TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER THERE WAS A GENERAL INSOLVENCY AMONG THEM OCCASIONALLY LARGE LOSSES TO NEW YORK MERCHANTS AND IN SOME CASES FAILURE

HE POSSESSED APPARENTLY MORE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE THAN EITHER OF HIS COMPANIONS
I CHEERFULLY ENDORSE THE ABOVE S.M.D
AND WHAT MADE IT STILL MORE UNPLEASANT FOR ANTHONY WAS THAT MR LEWIS WOULD FREQUENTLY REMIND HIM THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO SELL HIM AS SOON AS HE GOT POSSESSION--THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY I CAN GET FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR YOU EASILY AND I WILL DO IT THIS CONTEMPTUOUS THREAT HAD CAUSED ANTHONY'S BLOOD TO BOIL TIME AND AGAIN
IT WAS ROBERT PURVIS GOOD FORTUNE BEFORE HE ATTAINED HIS MAJORITY TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THAT EARNEST AND SELF-SACRIFICING PIONEER OF FREEDOM BENJAMIN LUNDY

AFTERWARD DANIEL AND HIS NEPHEW WILLIAM GIBBONS WENT WITH THIS MAN TO ADAMS COUNTY
WILLIAM NELSON AND WIFE WILLIAM THOMAS LOUISA BELL AND ELIAS JASPER
AGAINST THIS USAGE ELIZABETH URGED NO COMPLAINT
EXCEPTING TWO OF THE SOUTHERN STATES TEXAS AND ARKANSAS SHE HAS TRAVELED LARGELY OVER ALL THE OTHERS AND IN NO INSTANCE HAS SHE PERMITTED HERSELF THROUGH FEAR TO DISAPPOINT AN AUDIENCE WHEN ENGAGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FOR HER TO SPEAK ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY ADMONISHED THAT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO VENTURE IN SO DOING
CHEERS I KNOW THAT TO SOME THIS WILL SOUND AS THE LANGUAGE OF EXAGGERATED FEELING
THE SON EARLY SHOWED AN ARDENT DESIRE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND WAS DISTINGUISHED AMONG HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS FOR WARM AFFECTIONS AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND GENIAL MANNERS RARE PURITY AND REFINEMENT OF FEELING AND A TASTE FOR LITERARY PURSUITS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPER FOR THE LEARNED COUNSEL ON THE PART OF THE PLAINTIFF IF HE THOUGHT THE WITNESSES ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT UNWORTHY OF BELIEF TO HAVE PROVED THEM SO
NEW JERSEY CONTAINED A FEW WELL-TRIED FRIENDS BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS TO WHICH MISS GOODWIN BELONGED

MY FRIEND S.R
AFTER SHE HAD PASSED EIGHTEEN HOURS IN THE CHEST THE STEAMER ARRIVED AT THE WHARF IN PHILADELPHIA AND IN DUE TIME THE LIVING FREIGHT WAS BROUGHT OFF THE BOAT AND AT FIRST WAS DELIVERED AT A HOUSE IN BARLEY STREET OCCUPIED BY PARTICULAR FRIENDS OF THE MOTHER
BESIDES SLAVES THE OLD MAN WAS IN POSSESSION OF A WIFE WHOSE NAME WAS MARTHA AND SEVEN CHILDREN WHO WERE PRETTY WELL GROWN UP
AND TO EXPRESS AS YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THROUGH THE MOUTHS OF THE ELOQUENT SPEAKERS WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME SENTIMENTS OF PEACE AND OF GOOD-WILL TOWARD THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC

THE INITIAL W
KIRK HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW AND ABNER RICHARDSON FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE RIGHT AT HIS HEELS HE WAS GONE
PROBABLY NOT ONE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN
IN THE EARTHQUAKE GOD HAS SPOKEN
MY LIFE IN THE DOMESTIC SPHERE SHE SAYS HAS PASSED MUCH AS THAT OF OTHER WIVES AND MOTHERS OF THIS COUNTRY
ACCORDINGLY ANN WAS SOON PUT ON THE AUCTION BLOCK AND WAS BOUGHT BY A MAN WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM MOORE
AT THAT INSTANT ONE OF MY FRIENDS CRIED OUT--'WHERE IS THE MAN THAT BETRAYED US SPYING HIM AT THE SAME MOMENT HE SHOT HIM BADLY WOUNDING HIM THEN THE CONFLICT FAIRLY BEGAN
I DODGED THEM SAID JACK
YOUNG GORSUCH ASKED HIS FATHER TO LEAVE BUT THE OLD MAN REFUSED DECLARING AS IT IS SAID AND BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD GO TO HELL OR HAVE HIS SLAVES FINDING THEY COULD DO NOTHING FURTHER HANAWAY AND LEWIS BOTH STARTED TO LEAVE AGAIN COUNSELLING THE SLAVE-HUNTERS TO GO AWAY AND THE COLORED PEOPLE TO PEACE BUT HAD GONE BUT A FEW RODS WHEN ONE OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE ATTEMPTED TO COME OUT AT THE DOOR
IN LOOKING BACK UPON HIS DAYS OF BONDAGE HIS MIND REVERTED TO DR SAVINGTON OF HARFORD COUNTY AS THE PERSON WHO OWED HIM FOR YEARS OF HARD AND UNREQUITED TOIL AND AT THE SAME TIME WAS HIS SO-CALLED OWNER
HIS WANT OF ABILITY TO GUIDE IN PERSON RUNAWAY SLAVES OR TO TRAVEL WITH THEM PREVENTED HIM FROM TAKING ACTIVE PART IN THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURES AND HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPES WHICH HIS BRAIN AND TACT RENDERED POSSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL
WHEN THE QUESTION STILL SO MOMENTOUS AND EXCITING OF THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO RACES IN THIS COUNTRY SHALL HAVE PASSED FROM THE VORTEX OF POLITICAL STRIFE AND SOCIAL PREJUDICE AND TAKEN ITS PLACE AMONG THE ETHICAL AXIOMS OF A CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION THEN THIS FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE DARKEST AND SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST INCIDENTS IN OUR HISTORY--THIS CYCLOPAEDIA OF ALL THE VIRTUES AND ALL THE VICES OF HUMANITY--WILL BE ACCEPTED AS A MOST VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANNALS OF ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ERAS OF THE WORLD FROM THE LUTHERAN OBSERVER PHILADELPHIA IT IS A REMARKABLE BOOK IN MANY RESPECTS
J.B WAS NOT ONLY A TRUSTY AND CAPABLE CONDUCTOR OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN WASHINGTON BUT WAS ALSO A PRACTICAL LAWYER AT THE SAME TIME
I CANNOT DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS ON HEARING THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE
HE WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE LIGHT COMPLEXION--TALL--RATHER HANDSOME-LOOKING INTELLIGENT AND OF GOOD MANNERS
BUT PRIVATE CONFIDENCE IS THE CREED IN ENGLAND AND THOU NEEDST NOT FEAR MY ABUSING IT

HIS FATHER WAS SOLD AWAY WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT CONSEQUENTLY HE NEVER SAW HIM
THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT PRE-EMINENTLY AN EMOTIONAL PEOPLE
MY DEAR SIR I COULD FEEL SO MUCH BETTER SATTISFIED IF I COULD HEAR FROM MY WIFE
THE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN LEFT IN PETERSBURG HOWEVER NATURALLY CAUSED HIM MUCH ANXIETY
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS TRIALS HERE OR ELSEWHERE HE FOUND A RICH REWARD FOR HIS FAITHFULNESS IN THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL GROWTH WHICH HE ATTAINED BY ASSOCIATION WITH THE MOST ADVANCED MINDS OF THE TIME AND HE HAS OFTEN BEEN HEARD TO SAY THAT NO PART OF HIS LIFE HAS BEEN MORE FULLY AND GENEROUSLY COMPENSATED THAN THAT DEVOTED TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE
N
N
THAT TIME HAVING ELAPSED AND I HAVING AGREED TO AN EXTRA FIFTY DOLLARS TO ENSURE PROMPTNESS
WHEN MR ROGERS AND OTHERS WERE ABOUT TO BE DRIVEN AWAY SHE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE THE SCHOOL ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES
FOR A TIME HE HID IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE WHICH WENT VERY HARD WITH HIM YET HE WAS WILLING TO SUFFER ANYTHING RATHER THAN GO BACK TO HIS SO-CALLED MASTER
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE GAVE HER A DIVORCE SO SHE WAS CONSIDERED SINGLE FOR LIFE
I WROTE NOTICES TO BE READ IN THE COLORED CHURCHES AND COLORED SABBATH-SCHOOLS WHICH I DELIVERED IN PERSON
HE WAS OF A CHESTNUT COLOR AND OF AVERAGE SIZE
HE DID NOT MEAN TO WORK FOR ANY BODY FOR NOTHING
ARRIVALS IN APRIL 1856
ARRIVALS IN APRIL 1856
AS HIS EXCUSE FOR LEAVING THEM HE SAID COOLLY THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD GET ALONG BETTER IN FREEDOM THAN HE COULD IN SLAVERY AND THAT NO MAN HAD A RIGHT TO HIS LABOR WITHOUT PAYING HIM FOR IT
NOR TO RECLAIM THEM WHEN THEY PANTING FOR LIBERTY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE YOUR GRASP
THESE ARE GOLDEN WORDS WHICH WE QUOTE FROM HER OWN MODEST NOTES

MOONDO AND CHAS
THE GIRL THAT CAME WITH ME IS IN CANADA NEAR THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE
THOU SHALT NOT DELIVER UNTO HIS MASTER THE SERVANT THAT HAS ESCAPED FROM HIS MASTER UNTO THEE DEUT
IN THIS PLACE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO WAIT EIGHT LONG MONTHS ENDURING DAILY SUFFERING IN VARIOUS WAYS ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER SEASON
THERE WERE THE TWO SISTERS SARAH AND ANGELINA GRIMKE LADIES WHO CAME FROM SOUTH CAROLINA WHO LIBERATED THEIR SLAVES AND DEVOTED ALL THEY HAD TO THE SERVICE OF THIS JUST CAUSE
WHEN A SEVERE COLD CO-OPERATING WITH THE DECAY OF NATURE BROUGHT HIM HIS SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL
ANN 397
HE DIED IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SPRING OF 1844
I FIND IN THE MELEE NEAR THIS TOWN ONE OF THE IRISHMEN GOT HIS ARM BROKEN IN TWO PLACES
THE CAPTAIN LAUGHING HEARTILY AS DID THE OTHER PASSENGERS AT THE TUG NOW BEING MADE
HE WAS A VERY HUMBLE-LOOKING SPECIMEN OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE MEDIUM SIZE AND OF A DARK HUE
THIS STEP LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY HARD BUT WHAT ELSE COULD THE POOR FELLOW DO
SHE WAS OF AGREEABLE MANNERS ABOUT FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE DARK COMPLEXION ROUND BUILT AND INTELLIGENT
THE BLACKS INCREASING BY NEW ARRIVALS UNTIL THEY PROBABLY NUMBERED FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY MOST OF THEM ARMED IN SOME WAY
CUNNAGAN HAD HIRED HIM OUT IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE WAS ACCUSED OF BEING IN THE SCHOONER PEARL WITH CAPT
HALL HE HAD JUS RESEVED A LETTER FROM YOU STATING THAT MY WIFE WAS WITH YOU OH MY I WAS SO GLAD IT CASE ME TO SHED TEARS
QUITE A SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT IS GIVEN IN THE LETTER BELOW OF THE IRISHMAN WHO WAS SHOT IN THE FOREHEAD ALSO OF ONE OF THE SAME KIN WHO IN MEDDLING WITH UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS GOT HIS ARM BROKEN IN TWO PLACES ETC
FINALLY ONE WAS PROCURED AND AGAIN THE BOX WAS LAID HOLD OF BY THE OCCUPANT'S PARTICULAR FRIEND WHEN TO HIS DREAD ALARM THE POOR FELLOW WITHIN GAVE A SUDDEN COUGH
WHETHER JAMES EVER SUCCEEDED IN RECOVERING HIS WIFE AND CHILD IS NOT KNOWN TO THE WRITER
INDULGING IN REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT THE WRITER ON GOING FROM HIS DINNER THAT DAY TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE TO HIS SURPRISE FOUND AN OFFICER AWAITING HIS COMING
HER MISTRESS BELONGED TO THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH BUT WOULD HAVE FAMILY PRAYERS ONLY WHEN THE MINISTER WOULD STOP ELIZABETH THOUGHT THAT SHE TOOK GREATER PAINS TO PLEASE THE MINISTER THAN HER MAKER
HE IS A WIDOWER AND IS RICH ON THE ROAD THE POOR MOTHER WITH HER TRAVEL-WORN CHILDREN BECAME DESPERATELY ALARMED FEARING THAT THEY WERE BETRAYED
HILLIS JOHN 500
AFTERWARDS THE MAN LIVED WITH THORNTON WALTON
NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS
I ACTED AS THE CLERK OF THE CHURCH
THE MYSTERY ALLUDED TO WHICH THE ABOVE LETTER DID NOT CONTAIN AND WHICH THE COURT FAILED TO MAKE MR WILLIAMSON REVEAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRUTHFULLY EXPLAINED IN THESE WORDS
VEILED BY HER MODEST AND RETIRING DISPOSITION TO FEW BEYOND THE CIRCLE OF HER HOME WERE KNOWN THE BEAUTY AND BENEFICENCE OF HER NOISELESS LIFE
THERE WERE ABOUT $5000 RAISED IN ENGLAND TO REDEEM THIS FAMILY AND THEY ARE NOW ALL FREE EXCEPT THIS ONE
BUT MILES WAS NOT SATISFIED
AND YET NEITHER HE NOR I COULD CONJECTURE THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT
SHE WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF FRANCES HILLIARD AND ESCAPED FROM RICHMOND VA WHERE SHE WAS OWNED BY BEVERLY BLAIR
HENRY HOWEVER COULD NOT CONTENT HIMSELF UNTIL HE HAD TAKEN ANOTHER GOOD LOOK AT MR HOBSON
SAID ROBERT
LUCRETIA MOTT IS ONE OF THE NOBLEST REPRESENTATIVES OF IDEAL WOMANHOOD
WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABOUT
THE ABOVE NAMED PASSENGERS WERE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THOMAS GARRETT BY THE CAPTAIN WHO BROUGHT THEM AND WERE AIDED AND FORWARDED TO THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA AS INDICATED BY THE SUBJOINED LETTER
BY THE HARDEST TOIL HE MANAGED TO MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND FAMILY IN A HUMBLE WAY
AND THEY HOPED I SHOULD BE ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST THEM IN RAISING THE MONEY
DOUBTLESS THE BRAVERY STRUGGLES AND TRIALS OF EMILY THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY HAD IN HIS ESTIMATION ADDED NOT A LITTLE TO HER CHARMS
BUT SHE MADE ONLY A BRIEF VISIT THENCE RETURNING TO PHILADELPHIA HER ADOPTED HOME
HE THEN ASK ME WAS I GOING TO SETTLE IN CANADA
HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE HELD BY SAMUEL PATTISON ESQ A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH A GREAT BIG MAN WITH RED EYES BALD HEAD DRANK PRETTY FREELY AND IN THE LANGUAGE OF JOSEPH WOULDN'T BEAR NOTHING TWO OF JOSEPH'S BROTHERS-IN-LAW HAD BEEN SOLD BY HIS MASTER
A VERY FULL ACCOUNT OF JIM WAS FORWARDED IN A LETTER TO M.A
BROWN
THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH WHICH WAS SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TAKEN FROM A SOUTHERN PAPER LEAVES NO ROOM TO DOUBT AS TO THE FATE OF THE TWO
SO WHEN SHE SAID TO THEM THAT A LIVE RUNAWAY COULD DO GREAT HARM BY GOING BACK BUT THAT A DEAD ONE COULD TELL NO SECRETS SHE WAS SURE TO HAVE OBEDIENCE
BY SPREADING THE BLASTING CURSE OF DESPOTISM OVER THE WHOLE SOIL OF THE NATION YOU MAY ALLAY THE BRUTAL FRENZY OF A HANDFUL OF SOUTHERN SLAVE-MASTERS
FACE ROUGH
WHY AGAIN INQUIRED THE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
I GOT TIRED OF HAVING BRYANT RIDING AFTER ME WORKING MY LIFE OUT OF ME SAID LEWIS
HOWEVER THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY ARRIVED BUT ANTHONY WAS NOT TO BE FOUND TO ANSWER TO HIS NAME AT ROLL CALL
PECUNIARY AID TO SOME EXTENT WAS RENDERED HIM IN THIS CITY FOR WHICH HE WAS GRATEFUL AND AFTER BEING UNITED IN MARRIAGE BY WM
WILLIAM SAID THAT HIS MASTER WAS A MAN OF VERY SAVAGE TEMPER SHORT AND CRABBED
THUS IN AN EMERGENCY SHE WOULD GIVE ALL TO UNDERSTAND THAT TIMES WERE VERY CRITICAL AND THEREFORE NO FOOLISHNESS WOULD BE INDULGED IN ON THE ROAD THAT SEVERAL WHO WERE RATHER WEAK-KNEED AND FAINT-HEARTED WERE GREATLY INVIGORATED BY HARRIET'S BLUNT AND POSITIVE MANNER AND THREAT OF EXTREME MEASURES THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
I FEAR I GIVE THE SUBJECT TOO MUCH RELATIVE IMPORTANCE
THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN REGULARLY ORGANIZED ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MONEY HAS BEEN OBTAINED A LARGE TRACT OF LAND HAS BEEN PURCHASED AMPLE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN SECURED AND A NORMAL SCHOOL HAS BEEN IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS
AND THAT AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE CONSTITUTED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THIS COURT WHO SOUGHT TO ARREST THE FUGITIVE WAS IMPEDED AND REPELLED BY MENACES AND VIOLENCE WHILE PROCLAIMING HIS CHARACTER AND EXHIBITING HIS WARRANT
DOUGLASS AND OTHERS WILL NOT SOON FORGET THAT HOSPITABLE HOME
HE IS THE PROPERTY OF MRS A.B
I COULD WRITE ON AND FILL MANY PAGES
HOW HIS LETTER WAS RECEIVED HENRY WAS NEVER INFORMED
HE LEFT HIS WIFE NANCY AND TWO CHILDREN
SHE WAS AS MISCHIEVOUS AND STINGY AS SHE COULD LIVE
WILLIAM HENRY MOODY BELINDA BIVANS ETC
THE TOPSHAM SEWING CIRCLE HAS BEGUN ITS FEEBLE OPERATIONS AGAIN
A HEAVY REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR HIM BUT THE HUNTERS FAILED TO FIND HIM IN THIS HIDING-PLACE UNDER THE FLOOR
ACCORDINGLY THE SECRETARY PROCURED THREE CARRIAGES WITH TRUSTWORTHY DRIVERS AND BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE SCHUYLKILL WHERE ALL WAS QUIET AS A COUNTRY GRAVE-YARD THE MOON WAS SHINING AND SOON THE MAST OF A SCHOONER WAS DISCOVERED

HUMAN NATURE HERE MADE A DEATH-STRUGGLE
HE WELL REMEMBERED THAT BECAUSE HE HAD RESISTED BEING FLOGGED BEING HIGH SPIRITED HIS MASTER HAD DECLINED TO SELL HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF MAKING AN EXAMPLE OF HIM--AS A WARNING TO THE OTHER SLAVES ON THE PLACE
THE INCESSANT AND FATIGUING LABORS IN WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED HAD SENSIBLY AFFECTED THE VIGOR OF A CONSTITUTION NATURALLY DELICATE AND RENDERED HIM PECULIARLY LIABLE TO THE INROADS OF DISEASE
MY OWNER WAS A HARD MAN SAID MILES IN SPEAKING OF HIS CHARACTERISTICS
THE LECTURER WAS THEN INTRODUCED AS MRS F.E.W
WELLS BROWN TOOK PUNCH'S VIRGINIA SLAVE AND DEPOSITED IT WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE BY THE GREEK SLAVE SAYING AUDIBLY AS AN AMERICAN FUGITIVE SLAVE I PLACE THIS VIRGINIA SLAVE BY THE SIDE OF THE GREEK SLAVE AS ITS MOST FITTING COMPANION NOT A WORD OR REPLY OR REMONSTRANCE FROM YANKEE OR SOUTHERNER

FOUR ABLE-BODIED ARTICLES IN ONE ARRIVAL 1857

CHURCH FROM LETTER OF HON
NOT ONE DOLLAR'S EXPENSE HAD THEY BEEN TO THEIR MISTRESS
AND ALTHOUGH THEY NECESSARILY HAD MANIFEST TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES TO DISCOURAGE AND BESET THEM THEY BATTLED BRAVELY WITH ALL THESE ODDS AND REACHED THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SAFELY
SAMUEL HAWKINS AND WIFE HAVE SINCE DIED BUT THEIR DESCENDANTS STILL LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD UNDER THE NAME OF HACKETT
THINE FOR THE POOR SLAVE LEVI COFFIN
THE UNDYING FAITH THEY HAD IN GOD AS EVINCED BY THEIR TOUCHING APPEALS ON BEHALF OF THEIR FELLOW-SLAVES
MOTHER AND FATHER WERE AGAIN REUNITED IN FREEDOM WHILE TWO OF THEIR LITTLE BOYS WERE IN SLAVERY
AMONG WHICH WERE THE ANTI-SLAVERY RECORD THE EMANCIPATOR THE SLAVE'S FRIEND THE LATTER TO INDOCTRINATE THE CHILDREN IN ANTI-SLAVERY
THE SHADOW OF THE AMERICAN ARMY BECOMES A COVERT FOR THE SLAVE AND BENEATH THE AMERICAN EAGLE HE GRASPS THE KEY OF KNOWLEDGE AND IS LIFTED TO A HIGHER DESTINY THIS LETTER WE HAD INTENDED SHOULD COMPLETE THE SKETCH OF MRS HARPER'S ANTI-SLAVERY LABORS
SHE SPOKE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND A HALF HER SUBJECT BEING THE MISSION OF THE WAR AND THE DEMANDS OF THE COLORED RACE IN THE WORK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND WE HAVE SELDOM SEEN AN AUDIENCE MORE ATTENTIVE BETTER PLEASED OR MORE ENTHUSIASTIC
HIS ESCAPE IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID IMPLIED A DIRECT PROTEST AGAINST THE CONDUCT OF DR THOMAS W
HE SAID SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING MISCHIEF AND HE DIDN'T LIKE A MISCHIEF MAKER THUS HE COMPLAINED OF BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS SEEMING NOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD NO RIGHTS WHICH THEY WERE BOUND TO RESPECT DAVID EDWARDS BROKE AWAY FROM THE ABOVE NAMED BRYANT AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-FOUR
WITH MY ARMS AROUND MY MASTER'S NECK I BEGGED AND PRAYED HIM TO TELL ME WHY HE HAD SOLD ME
I MUST NOW COME TO A CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I REMAIN YOUR BELOVED FRIEND LEWIS COBB
THE OTHER HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF BY A TERRIBLE STROKE WITH A COWHIDE IN THE HAND OF HIS MISTRESS THIS LADY HE PRONOUNCED TO BE A PERFECT SAVAGE AND ADDED THAT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COWHIDING ANY OF HER SLAVES WHENEVER SHE FELT LIKE IT WHICH WAS QUITE OFTEN PERRY WAS ABOUT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AND A MAN OF PROMISE
HER SERVITUDE UNTIL WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF HER ESCAPE HAD BEEN PASSED IN VIRGINIA UNDER MRS MCCOY'S FATHER WHEN TO ACCOMMODATE THE DAUGHTER SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO BALTIMORE
SUNDAY I ADDRESSED A SUNDAY-SCHOOL IN TALADEGA
JOHNSON TO HIS WIFE
HIS LARGE HEAD AND ITS FORMATION INDICATED A LARGE BRAIN
TRUE THE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AND BROTHERS LEFT IN THE PRISON HOUSE LARGELY MARRED HIS JOY AS IT DID ALSO THE COMMITTEE'S STILL THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT CHARLES HAD GAINED HIS FREEDOM HONORABLY AND AT THE SAME TIME HAD LEFT HIS MASTER A POORER IF NOT A WISER MAN BY AT LEAST $1200
THEY REACHED LONGWOOD MEETING-HOUSE IN THE EVENING AT WHICH PLACE A FAIR CIRCLE HAD CONVENED AND STAYED A WHILE IN THE MEETING THEN AFTER REMAINING ALL NIGHT WITH ONE OF THE KENNET FRIENDS THEY WERE BROUGHT TO DOWNINGTOWN EARLY IN THE MORNING AND FROM THENCE BY DAYLIGHT TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THIS PLACE
NEVERTHELESS SARAH COULD NOT FORGET HOW BADLY SHE HAD BEEN TREATED BY HER WHILE LIVING
BEING IN THE PRIME OF HIS LIFE THIRTY-NINE YEARS OF AGE AND HAVING THE ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR TRAVELING OVER THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD HE WAS JUST THE MAN TO ENDURE THE TRIALS CONSEQUENT UPON SUCH AN UNDERTAKING
BUT I PRETTY SOON MADE UP MY MIND IN THE WATER TO TRY AND GET TO A FREE STATE AND GO TO CANADA AND MAKE THE TRIAL ANYHOW BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO TRAVEL SUCH GREAT CHANGES IN ALFRED'S PROSPECTS HAVING BEEN WROUGHT IN SO SHORT A WHILE TOGETHER WITH SUCH A FEARFUL LOOKING-FOR OF A FATE IN THE FAR SOUTH MORE HORRID THAN DEATH SUDDENLY AS BY A MIRACLE HE TURNS HIS FACE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NORTH
LETTER FROM MRS
IF THE LIBERATION OF THE SLAVE DEMANDED IT I COULD CONSENT TO PART WITH A PORTION OF THE BLOOD FROM MY OWN VEINS IF THAT WOULD DO HIM ANY GOOD AFTER HAVING THUS ALLUDED TO FREE LABOR SHE GAVE A SHORT JOURNAL OF THE DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE SHE HAD RECENTLY LECTURED FROM THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER TO THE 20TH OF OCTOBER WHICH WE MENTION HERE SIMPLY TO SHOW THE PERSEVERANCE WHICH CHARACTERIZED HER AS AN ADVOCATE OF HER ENSLAVED RACE AND AT THE SAME TIME SHOW HOW DOORS EVERYWHERE OPENED TO HER

FOR SOME DISTANCE THEY ROWED NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE
MANY TIMES IT REQUIRED A PRETTY HEAVY PRESSURE TO START OFF A NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THEY SEEMED UNWILLING TO WAIT TO BE WORN OUT UNDER THE YOKE AND VIOLENT TREATMENT OR TO BECOME ENCUMBERED WITH WIVES AND CHILDREN BEFORE LEAVING

WELL SIR SAID EVAN I THOUGHT TO TRY AND DO BETTER HOW DID YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO LEAVE YOUR WIFE AND CHILD IN SLAVERY
THAT OLD SCOUNDREL WHO APPLIED TO ME SOME THREE WEEKS SINCE PRETENDING THAT HE WISHED ME TO ASSIST HIM IN GETTING HIS SEVEN SLAVES INTO A FREE STATE TO AVOID THE SHERIFF AND WHICH I AGREED TO DO IF HE WOULD BRING THEM HERE
MILLS SARAH ANN 491
HE WAS TAKEN WITHOUT ANY CLOTHING EXCEPT HIS NIGHT CLOTHES
JOSIAH WAS THE FOREMAN ON THE PLACE AND WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF HAULING THE SHIP-TIMBER AND THROUGH HARVESTING AND BUSY SEASONS WAS REQUIRED TO LEAD IN THE FIELDS
AFTER PASSING SEVERAL YEARS IN CANADA AS HAS BEEN ALREADY NOTICED HE RETURNED TO RICHMOND AND PAID A VISIT TO HIS OLD HOME
YET JAMES ADMITTED THAT HIS MASTER WAS NOT AS HARD ON HIS SLAVES AS SOME OTHERS
MOST FEARFUL INDEED WAS HIS CONDITION WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN THIS CITY
IN THE MEANTIME MY FRIEND CRAVEN WHO WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF WAS SHOT BADLY IN THE FACE AND MOST VIOLENTLY BEATEN UNTIL HE WAS CONQUERED AND TIED
THERE ARE SOME BOOKS THE DOCTOR SAYS I MUST HAVE SUCH AS THE MEDICAL DICTIONARY PHYSICIAN'S DICTIONARY AND A WORK ON ANATOMY

FOSTER EMILY ALIAS ANN WOOD 124
HIS BUSINESS CAREER WAS ONE OF VICISSITUDE BUT GENERALLY AND ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL FOR HE MADE THE WHOLE OF THE COMFORTABLE COMPETENCE OF WHICH HE DIED POSSESSED AFTER HE WAS SIXTY YEARS OF AGE
ONE GENTLEMAN ASKED MASTER JOHN WHAT HE WOULD TAKE FOR ME AND OFFERED A THOUSAND DOLLARS
BUT IT WAS EASIER FOR HIM TO IMAGINE PLANS BY WHICH HE COULD GET THEM OFF THAN TO INCUR THE HAZARD OF GOING BACK TO MARYLAND
OF HER SLAVE-LIFE NOTHING OF INTEREST WAS RECORDED
IT WAS TRUE THAT THE MASTER MR WILLIAM BEARS WAS A YANKEE FROM CONNECTICUT AND HIS WIFE A MEMBER OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH BUT NANCY'S YOKE SEEMED NONE THE LIGHTER FOR ALL THAT
ON THIS ACCOUNT HE CLAIMED AS DID CERTAIN OTHERS THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN FAIR TO CHARGE FOR HIS SERVICES--INDEED HE DID NOT PROFESS TO BRING PERSONS FOR NOTHING EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES
WHEN VISITING AMONG THEIR FRIENDS THEY WERE USUALLY VERY POLITE WOULD BOW AND SCRAPE MORE THAN A LITTLE EVEN TO COLORED PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THEIR NAMES WERE IN BAD ODOR ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CRUELTY FOR THEY HAD BEEN IN THE PAPERS TWICE ABOUT HOW THEY ABUSED THEIR COLORED PEOPLE AS TO ADVERTISING HIM JOHN GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THEY WOULD BE ASHAMED TO DO IT FROM THE FACT THAT THEY HAD ALREADY RENDERED THEMSELVES MORE NOTORIOUS THAN THEY HAD BARGAINED FOR ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CRUELTY TOWARDS THEIR SLAVES
IN 1846 THE NON-SLAVE-HOLDER A MONTHLY PERIODICAL DEVOTED MAINLY TO THE ADVOCACY OF THE FREE PRODUCE CAUSE WAS ESTABLISHED IN PHILADELPHIA EDITED BY A.L
CONTRARY TO HER EXPECTATIONS HER ADOPTED HOME AND CALLING NOT PROVING SATISFACTORY SHE LEFT THAT STATE AND CAME TO PENNSYLVANIA AS A LAST RESORT AND AGAIN ENGAGED IN TEACHING AT LITTLE YORK
NOR DID HE WISH TO BE ENCUMBERED IF THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED TO ESCAPE
TO SEE THE FLAG OF THE REPUBLIC NOW TRULY FREE REPLACE THE FLAG OF SLAVERY ON FORT SUMTER
SIX YEARS BEFORE HER ARRIVAL HER HUSBAND HAD ESCAPED IN COMPANY WITH THE NOTED FUGITIVE SHADRACH FOR A TIME AFTER HE FLED SHE FREQUENTLY RECEIVED LETTERS FROM HIM BUT FOR A LONG WHILE HE HAD CEASED TO WRITE AND OF LATE SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING FROM HIM
GEORGIA WAS CONTINUALLY HELD UP TO THE SLAVES WITH A VIEW OF PRODUCING A WHOLESOME FEAR BUT IN THIS INSTANCE AS IN MANY SIMILAR ONES IT ONLY AWAKENED DESIRES TO SEEK FLIGHT VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
ABOUT THE 1ST OF JUNE 1855 THE FOLLOWING ARRIVALS WERE NOTED IN THE RECORD BOOK
PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN OF SOME SERVICE TO THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND I HOPE THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I HAVE NOT LIVED IN VAIN WILL BE A HALO OF PEACE AROUND MY DYING BED
AND AS REBECCA HAD ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD LONG BEFORE THIS EVENT THAT ALL THE SLAVES WERE TO BE FREED AT THE DEATH OF HER MISTRESS SHE WAS NOT PREPARED TO BELIEVE ANY OTHER REPORT
IT CAN NOW BE TAKEN FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH
WHEN A SLAVE REACHED THIS DECISION HE WAS IN A VERY HOPEFUL STATE
ANN MARIA IS IT YOU THE GIRL LEAPED FROM THE WAGON AND THEY FELL ON EACH OTHER'S NECKS WEEPING AND REJOICING
17 SEC
BUT HAVING THE FAITH OF THOSE SPOKEN OF IN THE SCRIPTURES WHO WANDERED ABOUT IN DENS AND CAVES OF THE EARTH BEING DESTITUTE AFFLICTED AND TORMENTED HE ENDURED TO THE END AND ARRIVED SAFELY TO THE COMMITTEE
HE FOUND THY LETTER WHEN HE GOT HERE
DANIEL WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY JUST AT A CAPITAL AGE TO MAKE A BOLD STRIKE FOR FREEDOM
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU HAD NEITHER BEEN STARVED NOR FROZEN
I HAVE BEEN HELD IN BONDAGE ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS BY HOLSER BUT HAVE FAILED SO FAR TO FIND ANY GOOD TRAITS IN HIS CHARACTER

DEAR FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--CAPTAIN FOUNTAIN HAS ARRIVED ALL SAFE WITH THE HUMAN CARGO THEE WAS INQUIRING FOR A FEW DAYS SINCE
MAKING AFTER ALL THE BLOOD POURED OUT LIKE WATER AND WEALTH SCATTERED LIKE CHAFF A RETURN TO THE OLD IDEA THAT A WHITE REBEL IS BETTER OR OF MORE ACCOUNT IN THE BODY POLITIC THAN A LOYAL BLACK MAN
THE CHILD HAS TWO COUSINS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY
HAVING NOW A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE CARS WOULD START AGAIN I SAT DOWN AND HASTILY WROTE A FEW LINES TO INFORM FRIENDS AT HOME OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL
HE HAS IN CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESENT WRITER AND OTHERS FREQUENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE VALUABLE SERVICES OF TWO ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRISH BIRTH STILL LIVING IN THIS CITY WHO WERE EVER FAITHFUL TO HIM AND WILL NOW BE AMONGST THOSE WHO MOST EARNESTLY MOURN HIS DECEASE
ACCORDINGLY GEORGE SET OUT
HE WAS THE SOUL OF HONOR IN BUSINESS
THOUGH NEVER AT ANY TIME CONNECTED WITH THE COLLEGE HE REGARDED ITS SUCCESS WITH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE INTEREST CONSIDERING ITS PROPOSITION AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS OF HIS LIFE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE THE MAN WAS GONE

ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK VA 1858
IT IS THOUGHT THAT HE HELPED AWAY DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE NEARLY ONE THOUSAND SLAVES
THE AGENT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN NEW YORK TOOK CHARGE OF THEM AND FORWARDED THEM TO ALBANY AND BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO CANADA
IN VIEW OF RECEIVING THIS SMALL PITTANCE HE HAD TOILED HARD--DOING OVER-WORK IN ORDER TO MAKE BUCKLE AND STRAP MEET ONCE HE HAD BEEN SOLD ON THE AUCTION-BLOCK
HE SAID HE WOULD WRITE THE WHOLE HISTORY TO THEE IN A FEW DAYS AS FAR AS HE COULD
WITH A CHEERFUL HEART THE JOURNEY WAS UNDERTAKEN IN THE MANNER AFORESAID AND SHE SAFELY REACHED THE COMMITTEE

I SAW HIM THREE TIMES
SHE SURVIVED HER HUSBAND ABOUT EIGHT YEARS DYING ON THE SIXTEENTH OF THE TENTH MONTH 1860
NANCY GRANTHAM ALSO FLED FROM NEAR RICHMOND AND WAS FORTUNATE IN THAT SHE ESCAPED FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN
I CANNOT BUT HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT SLAVERY WILL ERE LONG CEASE
WHILE THE RECORDS CONTAIN NO DEFINITE ACCOUNT OF OTHER CHILDREN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE OTHERS BUT WHAT BECAME OF THEM IS NOT KNOWN
SUCH ARE SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN MY HEARING AND IN REGARD TO WHICH IT HAS BECOME YOUR DUTY AS THE GRAND INQUEST OF THE DISTRICT TO MAKE LEGAL INQUIRY
UPON INQUIRY AS TO THE TREATMENT AND CHARACTER OF HIS MASTER SAUNEY UNHESITATINGLY DESCRIBED HIM AS A VERY MEAN SWEARING BLUSTERING MAN AS HARD AS ANY THAT COULD BE STARTED IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT HE WAS PROMPTED TO TURN HIS FACE AGAINST VIRGINIA AND TO VENTURE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
ALL THEY FEARED WAS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT REACH CANADA SAFELY ALTHOUGH THEY WERE PRETTY HOPEFUL AND QUITE RESOLUTE
AND AS I HAVE MANY ACQUAINTANCES THERE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU WHETHER IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE OR NOT
BUT HE HOLDS ME WHILE THE SLAVEHOLDER CLAIMED THAT SHE BELONGED TO HIM HE SAID THAT SHE WAS FREE
THIS WAS A RARE CASE
WHERE SHE WAS THEN HE COULD NOT TELL BUT HOPED TO MEET HER IN CANADA

THE HISTORY OF THIS BRAVE AND NOBLE EFFORT OF YOUNG PURVIS IN RESCUING A FELLOW-BEING FROM THE JAWS OF SLAVERY HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN IN COLUMBIA TO A GENERATION THAT WAS BORN SINCE THAT EVENT HAS TRANSPIRED
HIS MASTER HE REGARDED AS A VERY FRACTIOUS MAN HARD TO PLEASE THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE OR UNPLEASANTNESS WHICH RESULTED IN SAMUEL'S UNDERGROUND ADVENTURE WAS TRACEABLE TO HIS MASTER'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW HIM TO VISIT HIS WIFE
JOHNSON JANE MARY ALIAS HARRIET 160
I AM ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH AND HOPE WHEN THIS REACHES YOU YOU MAY BE ENJOYING THE SAME BLESSING
THESE INDIVIDUALS ESCAPED FROM THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND IN THE SPRING OF 1853 BUT WERE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY COULD ENJOY THE FREEDOM THEY HAD AIMED TO FIND IN NEW JERSEY
THE BOY AND THE WOMAN BROUGHT $700
THE COMING OF THIS INTERESTING PARTY WAS AS GRATIFYING AS THEIR DEPARTURE MUST HAVE BEEN DISAGREEABLE TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF THEIR UNPAID LABOR
INDEED I HAVE NEVER SEEN ATTACHMENT BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN OR HUSBAND AND WIFE MORE ENTIRE THAN WAS MANIFESTED IN THE CASE OF PETER
WITHAL SHE APPEARED UNUSUALLY KIND SO MUCH SO THAT BEFORE RETIRING TO BED IN THE EVENING SHE WOULD CALL CORDELIA TO HER CHAMBER AND BY HER SIDE WOULD TAKE HER PRAYER-BOOK AND BIBLE AND GO THROUGH THE FORMS OF DEVOTIONAL SERVICE

SUCH A SPIRIT AS HE POSSESSED COULD NOT REST IN SERVITUDE
COMMISSIONER AND SHOULD ELLEN BE FOUND IN HIS HOUSE HE MUST RESIGN HIS OFFICE AS WELL AS INCUR THE PENALTY OF THE LAW AND I WILL NOT SUBJECT A FRIEND TO SUCH A PUNISHMENT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR SAFETY WAS NOT THIS NOBLE WHEN YOU THINK HOW SMALL WAS THE PENALTY THAT ANY ONE COULD RECEIVE FOR AIDING SLAVES TO ESCAPE COMPARED TO THE FATE WHICH THREATENED THEM IN CASE THEY WERE CAPTURED
HE WAS BORN IN JUNE 1788 IN LONG ISLAND
THE INFLICTION OF A SEVERE FLOGGING FROM THE HAND OF HIS MASTER AWAKENED PERRY TO CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.G.R.R
IT WAS PLACED IN A ONE HORSE WAGON AT THE INSTANCE OF CUSTUS AND DRIVEN TO SEVENTH AND MINSTER STREETS
ON THE CONTRARY HIS MASTER TALKED SOMETIMES AS THOUGH HE WANTED TO BE GOOD AND GET RELIGION BUT SAID HE COULD NOT WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO BE RICH EVERYTHING LOOKED HOPELESS IN WILLIAM'S EYES SO FAR AS THE MASTER'S RICHES AND HIS OWN FREEDOM WERE CONCERNED
IN JOURNEYING FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE ROBERT AND HIS WIFE WERE UNITED BOTH IN SYMPATHIES AND IN STRUGGLES
SHE WAS HOWEVER ALLOWED TO ENTER THE CARRIAGE THAT AWAITED HER WITHOUT DISTURBANCE
HE WAS NO BIGOT IN RELIGION
WHILE THE GRAND LITTLE ARMY OF ABOLITIONISTS WAS WAGING ITS UNTIRING WARFARE FOR FREEDOM PRIOR TO THE REBELLION NO AGENCY ENCOURAGED THEM LIKE THE HEROISM OF FUGITIVES
THE PAPER SENT ME WITH YOUR WELL-WRITTEN ARTICLE WAS RECEIVED AND ON READING IT TO DANIEL HE KNEW SOME OF THE PARTIES MENTIONED IN IT--HE WAS MUCH PLEASED TO HEAR IT READ
HILL CARE OF BOX NO
I HARD THIS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
SHE HOWEVER WAS NOT BLESSED WITH GOOD HEALTH THOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAVORED ANY MORE ON THAT ACCOUNT

I WAS JUST THINKING HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THEE HAD THAT STROKE PROVED FATAL SUCH THOUGHTS WERE AT ONCE THE NOTES OF HIS OWN PREPARATION AND A WARNING TO OTHERS TO BE ALSO READY
IF YOU SHOULD WANT ANY INFORMATION WITNESSES TO PROVE OR INDENTIFY THE NEGROES WRITE IMMEDIATELY ON TO ME
I HEAR THAT THEIR OWNERS HAVE PERSONS STATIONED AT SEVERAL PLACES ON THE ROAD WATCHING

PASCAL QUANTENCE
I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE BEST PART OF THE DAY
TELL HIM TO SEND NO
THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ADDRESS IS AS FOLLOWS
IN REFERENCE TO THE EXPEDITION OF WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD OUT SOME LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT I WILL BARELY REMARK THAT I SHALL BE GLAD IF IT IS UNDERTAKEN TO HAVE ALL THE NOTICE OF THE TIME AND MANNER THAT IS POSSIBLE SO AS TO MAKE READY
THANKFUL FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME TO BE A SACRIFICE FOR THE CAUSE HE LOVED HE SENT IN HIS RESIGNATION IN A LETTER FULL OF CHRISTIAN KINDNESS AND SORROW
GIVE MY LOVE TO MRS STILL AND ALSO YOUR DEAR LITTLE CHILDREN
THIS PARTY STATED THAT DR ANTHONY THOMPSON HAD CLAIMED THEM AS HIS PROPERTY
DR FURNESS HELD THE SAME POSITION AND OTHERS WHO LIKE HIM REFUSED TO BE ENROLLED IN THE UNDERGROUND COMMITTEE OR IN ANY DEFINITE ANTI-SLAVERY ORGANIZATION
THE LAND ROUTE PRESENTED LESS ENCOURAGEMENT THAN BY WATER
SAM WAS DOING SLAVE LABOR AT THE OFFICE OF THE RICHMOND DAILY DISPATCH AS A CARRIER OF THAT THOROUGHLY PRO-SLAVERY SHEET
SHE DARTED INTO A HATTER'S SHOP AND OUT THROUGH THE BACK BUILDINGS SPRINGING OVER A DYE KETTLE IN HER WAY AND CLEARED A BOARD FENCE AT A BOUND
I TOOK THE CHILDREN BY THE HANDS WHO BOTH CRIED FOR THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BUT BOTH STOPPED WHEN THEY GOT ON SHORE
DIRECT YOUR LETTER TO E.L
A CONTEMPORARY WHO HAD KNOWN HIM LONG AND INTIMATELY--WHO HAD APPRECIATED HIS DEVOTION TO FREEDOM WHO HAD SHARED WITH HIM SOME OF THE PERILS CONSEQUENT UPON AIDING THE FLEEING FUGITIVES AND WHO BELONGED TO THE RACE WITH WHOM GARRETT SYMPATHIZED AND FOR WHOSE ELEVATION AND FREEDOM HE LABORED SO ASSIDUOUSLY WITH AN OVERFLOWING HEART OF TENDER REGARD AND SYMPATHY--PENNED THE FOLLOWING WORDS TOUCHING THE SAD EVENT
OF COURSE THERE WERE THOSE WHOSE CONTINUAL COMING LIKE THE POOR WIDOW IN THE GOSPEL COULD NOT BE DENIED

PASSMORE WILLIAMSON JANE HER X MARK JOHNSON
ASHMEAD ATTORNEY OF THE U.S
LAST NIGHT MY TABLE WAS ADORNED WITH ROSES ALTHOUGH I DID NOT GET ONE CENT FOR MY LECTURE THE POLITICAL HEAVENS ARE GETTING SOMEWHAT OVERCAST
THEY TOGETHER WITH THE ARRESTED COLORED MEN WERE SENT TO LANCASTER JAIL THAT NIGHT
WHILE HE HATED SLAVERY HE TOOK A FAVORABLE VIEW OF HIS MASTER IN SOME RESPECTS AT LEAST AS HE SAID THAT HE WAS A MODERATE MAN IN TALK BUT SLY IN ACTION HIS MASTER PROVIDED HIM WITH TWO PAIRS OF PANTALOONS IN THE SUMMER AND ONE IN THE WINTER ALSO A WINTER JACKET NO VEST NO CAP OR HAT
I HOPE TO SEE THEM OFTEN
CHARLES WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE DARK OF QUICK MOTION AND READY SPEECH AND IN EVERY WAY APPEARING AS THOUGH HE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
BUT THAT HE HAD LONG HATED SLAVERY THOROUGHLY AND ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED WITH PERILS ON EVERY SIDE HE HAD NOT FAILED TO HELP A POOR SLAVE WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY WAS PRESENTED
CORNELIUS HENRY JOHNSON
I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN BEFORE THIS BUT I HAVE BEEN FROM HOME MUCH OF THE TIME SINCE SHE CAME TO OUR CITY
THE COMMITTEE PAID DUE ATTENTION TO HIS EX PARTE STATEMENT AND WAS OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS ARGUMENT CLOTHED IN COMMON AND HOMELY LANGUAGE WAS FORCIBLE IF NOT ELOQUENT AND THAT HE WAS WELL WORTHY OF AID
AS HE COULD NOT RETURN FOR HER DELIVERANCE HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO RESORT TO THE PEN HOPING IN THIS WAY TO EFFECT HIS GRAND OBJECT AS THE FOLLOWING LETTER WILL SHOW
JOHN CAME AS A PRIVATE PASSENGER ON ONE OF THE RICHMOND STEAMERS AND WAS INDEBTED TO THE STEWARD OF THE BOAT FOR HIS ACCOMMODATIONS
HE READILY CONFESSED THAT HE FLED FROM MRS JULIA A
WHERE THE EIGHTH WENT OR HOW HE GOT OFF WAS NOT KNOWN
THERE IS NO REGULARITY BY THE STEAMBOATS ON THE TENNESSEE RIVER
JUDAH JOHN 305
HIS NAME IS VENERATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN EUROPE WHERESOEVER CHRISTIANITY SOFTENS THE HEARTS AND LESSENS THE SORROWS OF MEN
HER NAME ARE MAY BALL WITH FIVE CHILDREN
FROM ANOTHER LETTER WE COPY AS FOLLOWS
THE BOX IS OPENED THE STRAW REMOVED AND THE POOR FELLOW IS LOOSED
BUT WE WILL NOT FURTHER ENLARGE
I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE HAS TOLD WHERE I LIVE AND MAY YET GET ME AND MY FRIENDS HERE IN TROUBLE TOO AS SHE HAS SOME IN OTHER PLACES
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
HER INJUNCTION TO MIND THE SLAVE COMES TO US AS THE DYING ADMONITION OF ONE WHOSE LIFE WAS A BEAUTIFUL EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE DUTY AND THE PRIVILEGE THUS ENJOINED
THE MASTER HAS AGREED TO TAKE FOR HIM JUST WHAT HE GAVE $1100
I HAVE COME TO SEE YOU INSTEAD OF MR GEO
STILL:--YOU WILL OBLIGE ME MUCH IFF YOU WILL DIRECT THIS LETTER TO VERGENIA FOR ME TO MY MOTHER IFF IT WELL SUTE YOU BEG HER IN MY LETTER TO DIRECT HERS TO YOU YOU CAN SEND IT TO ME IFF IT SUTE YOUR CONVENIENCE
ARE SO ANXIOUS TO LEARN HIS NAME--THERE WAS OTHERS STARTED LAST SATURDAY NIGHT--THEY ARE ALL MY OLD FRIENDS AND WE ARE WAITING THEIR ARRIVAL WE HOPE YOU WILL LOOK OUT FOR THEM THEY MAY COME BY WAY OF SALEM N.J
I GAVE HIM ALL I HAD AND MORE BUT IT SEEMED VERY LITTLE FOR FOUR TRAVELERS--ONLY A DOLLAR FOR EACH--BUT THEY WILL MEET WITH FRIENDS AND HELPERS ON THE WAY
SHE PROMISED HIM WHEN HE WAS SOLD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY AND EARNESTLY ENTREATED HIM IF HE EVER MET WITH THE LUCK TO COME AND SEE HER SHE WAS UNAWARE PERHAPS AT THAT TIME OF THE GREAT DISTANCE THAT WAS TO DIVIDE THEM
TO BE STORED IN OTHER THAN PRIVATE FAMILIES WOULD NOT ANSWER
THE MAYOR AND HIS POSSE SEEMED IF NOT DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED COMPLETELY CONFOUNDED AND BY THE TIME CAPTAIN F
DARK AND CLOUDY
AND IF THERE IS ANY BURDEN TO BE BORNE IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY-CAUSE--ANYTHING TO BE DONE TO WEAKEN OUR HATEFUL CHAINS OR ASSERT OUR MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO MY SHARE OF THE WORK
HE WAS A STOUT MAN ABOUT TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF AGE OF DARK COMPLEXION
THIS FROM YOUR FRIEND AND WELL WISHER EDWARD LEWIS FORMERLY BUT NOW WILLIAM BRADY
I FIRST SAW HER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF DOWNINGTOWN AT A PLACE THEY CALL DOWNING'S OLD STAGE OFFICE
BY NOTING DAILY THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE DAY
STILL:--_DEAR SIR_--I AM HAPPY TO THINK THAT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN WE NO DOUBT CAN OPEN OUR CORRESPONDENCE WITH ONE ANOTHER AGAIN
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS
ARRIVAL FROM TAPS NECK MD 1859
HIS HOUSE WAS A DEPOT FOR FUGITIVES AND MANY HUNDREDS HAS HE HELPED ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM
BUT I DID HEAR OF ONE TERRIBLE HUSBAND DEFENDING HIMSELF FOR THE UNMANLY PRACTICE WITH WELL I HAVE GOT TO WHIP HER OR LEAVE HER THERE WERE PARTS OF THE LECTURER'S DISCOURSE THAT GRATED A LITTLE ON A WHITE SOUTHERN EAR BUT IT WAS LOST AND FORGIVEN IN THE GENUINE EARNESTNESS AND PROFOUND GOOD SENSE WITH WHICH THE WOMAN SPOKE TO HER KIND IN WORDS OF SOUND ADVICE
HE HAD HAD IT SOMETIMES ROUGH AND SOMETIMES SMOOTH TO USE HIS OWN LANGUAGE
DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO BE OFF TO CANADA
NO AMOUNT OF DEPRAVITY COULD EXTINGUISH HIS HOPE OF REFORM
IN POSSESSING HIMSELF OF THIS PRIZE HE KNEW THAT THE LAW AGAINST SLAVES BEING TAUGHT WOULD HAVE TO BE BROKEN NEVERTHELESS HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SUCCEED THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO RUN THE RISK
A FEW YEARS SINCE SLAVERY TORTURED BURNED HUNG AND OUTRAGED US AND THE NATION PASSED BY AND SAID THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SLAVERY WHERE IT WAS SLAVERY WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEM WHERE THEY WERE
A ONE HORSE POWER WAS NEEDED
HE CONCLUDED THEREFORE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT BUYING
HOW DID YOU LIKE MR TYLER SAID AN INQUISITIVE MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
JOHN CAMPBELL HENRY WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHOM HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO ADDRESS AS MASTER AND FOR WHOSE BENEFIT HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO LABOR UP TO THE DAY HE TOOK OUT IN CONSIDERING WHAT HE HAD BEEN IN MARYLAND AND HOW HE HAD BEEN TREATED ALL HIS LIFE HE ALLEGED THAT JOHN CAMPBELL HENRY WAS A BAD MAN NOT ONLY HAD EPHRAIM BEEN TREATED BADLY BY HIS MASTER BUT HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT TO A MAN NO BETTER THAN HIS MASTER IF AS GOOD
THE LETTER THAT I RECEIVED REQUIRED A PLEDGE THAT I WOULD NOT TELL
THE NAMES OF HIS SISTERS AND BROTHERS WERE AS FOLLOWS
HOBSON
HOBSON
ACCORDINGLY HE LEFT AND WENT TO THE WOODS
HE AVERRED THAT SHE WAS THE CAUSE OF MATTERS BEING SO HARD WITH THE SLAVES ON THE PLACE
WHO INDEED AMONGST THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT HEARD OF WILLIAM WHIPPER
I HOPE YOU WILL INTERCEDE FOR MY CLOTHES AND AS SOON AS THEY COME PLEASE TO SEND THEM TO ME AND IF YOU HAVE NOT TIME GET DR LUNDY TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM AND WHEN THEY COME BE VERY CAREFUL IN SENDING THEM
THREE TIMES HE HAD MADE AN EFFORT TO GET OUT OF THE PRISON-HOUSE
HIS ACCOUNT OF THINGS WAS TOO HARROWING FOR DETAIL HERE EXCEPT IN THE BRIEFEST MANNER AND THAT ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO A FEW PARTICULARS
AT DIFFERENT TIMES AT LEAST TWO CAPTAINS HAD CONSENTED TO AFFORD HIM A PRIVATE PASSAGE TO PHILADELPHIA BUT LIKE THE IMPOTENT MAN AT THE POOL SOME ONE ALWAYS GOT AHEAD OF HIM
TO FIND A MAN WITH A LARGE HEART FOR DOING GOOD TO THE OPPRESSED WHO WILL COME TO WASHINGTON TO LIVE AND WHO WILL WALK OUT TO PENN'A OR A PART OF THE WAY THERE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK
THE WHOLE NATION SUBJUGATED TO THE AWFUL POWER OF SLAVERY ROSE UP IN MOBOCRATIC TUMULT AGAINST ANY AND EVERY EFFORT TO LIBERATE THE MILLIONS HELD IN BONDAGE ON ITS SOIL
BROWN CHAS
I COULD NOT GET TO SEE HIM OR THEM AS VINCENNES IS ABOUT THIRTY MILES FROM PRINCETON WHERE I WAS WHEN I HEARD OF THE CAPTURE
AUGUST 18 1856
HEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY
HEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY
WHEN THEY STARTED FROM THE LAND OF BONDAGE THEY HAD LARGE HOPES BUT NOT MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAY
JACKSON 223
BAILEY'S PRINTING-OFFICE AND PREMISES WERE AGAIN RUTHLESSLY ATTACKED AFTER THE HARPER'S FERRY OUTBREAK ON THE UNFOUNDED ASSUMPTION THAT HE WAS MEDITATING A SIMILAR PROCEEDING AND THAT IT WAS UNSAFE FOR A FREE PRESS TO BE ANY LONGER TOLERATED IN KENTUCKY
IN OBEDIENCE TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND THAT I MAY FULFILL MY PROMISES I WANT TO FIND OUT FROM YOU THE DESIRED INFORMATION
WHEN PLYMOUTH PARTED WITH HIS WIFE WITH A FULL HEART HE BADE HER GOOD-NIGHT WITHOUT INTIMATING TO HER THAT HE NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE HER AGAIN IN THIS WORLD
FROM TRAVELING PROBABLY SHE HAD CONTRACTED A VERY HEAVY COLD WHICH THREATENED HER WITH CONSUMPTION
I WAS HIRED OUT THIS YEAR FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT WHEN I WOULD GO TO HIM TO MAKE COMPLAINTS OF HARD TREATMENT FROM THE MAN I WAS HIRED TO HE WOULD SAY
FOR NINE DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT A GUIDE THEY TRAVELED AT A VERY EXHAUSTING RATE ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAD TO GO FASTING FOR THREE DAYS AND TO ENDURE VERY COLD WEATHER
$300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON THE 26TH DECEMBER 1857 NEGRO MAN ROBERT CARR
THE PLEASURE IT AFFORDED TO AID SUCH YOUNG WOMEN IN ESCAPING FROM A CONDITION SO LOATHSOME AS THAT OF SLAVERY IN MARYLAND WAS UNALLOYED
CORYELL OF THIS VILLAGE AND HE WILL SEE THAT ALL IS RIGHT
SHE SPOKE OF HAVING A MOTHER LIVING IN HAGERSTOWN BY THE NAME OF AMARIAN BALLAD ALSO THREE SISTERS WHO WERE SLAVES AND TWO WHO WERE FREE
ALL LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHENCE HE FLED
SLAVERY IS PECULIARLY HARD FOR CHILDREN THAT CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES NOR CAN THEIR PARENTS AND THE OLD TOO IT IS HARD FOR THEM
E.F
E.F
GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON WHEN THE ABOVE ARTICLE GAVE THE COMMITTEE HIS NAME THEY WERE AMUSED AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SIMPLY JESTING HAVING DONE A SMART THING IN CONQUERING HIS MASTER BY ESCAPING
STILL;--_DEAR FRIEND_:--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING YOU THESE FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU OF MY HEALTH WHICH IS GOOD AT PRESENT C

IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SERVANTS OLD JOHNSON HAD ME TIED STRIPPED AND WITH HIS OWN HANDS FLOGGED ME ON THE NAKED BACK SHAMEFULLY
THUS TERMINATED THIS TERRIBLE AFFAIR WHICH COST THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA NEARLY $3000 AS WELL AS A HEAVY EXPENSE TO MANY CITIZENS OF BALTIMORE AND THOSE OF THIS COUNTY WHO TOOK AN ACTIVE PART AND WHILST IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR IN THIS SAD TRANSACTION FULLY ATONED FOR HIS EVIL DEEDS WHILST LIVING AND HIS FRIENDS MAY HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO EULOGIZE HIM AFTER DEATH THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRADUCE OTHER PARTIES DEAD AND ALIVE WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE KNOWN BY LIVING WITNESSES TO BE BEYOND REPROACH
FENDALL
THEY SAID THE TIME COULDN'T BE SPARED THIS WAS THE LAST STRAW ON THE CAMEL'S BACK
HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SENT TO A HOUSE IN THE GREAT CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE WHERE HE WOULD HAVE FOUND A MORE CORDIAL AND SINCERE RECEPTION
ANOTHER OF THEIR EARLY RECOLLECTIONS WAS OF A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS TO BE WAVED FROM A BACK WINDOW AS A SIGNAL OF DANGER TO A COLORED MAN AT WORK IN A WOOD NEAR BY
GOD BLESS HER AND GIVE HER GREAT PEACE AT A LATER PERIOD SHE VISITED CHARLESTON AND COLUMBIA AND WAS WELL RECEIVED IN BOTH PLACES
HE WAS CALLED A HICKORY QUAKER AND HE HAD A REAL QUAKER FOR A WIFE
MILLER MCKIM AND WILLIAM STILL:--CAPTAIN F HAS ARRIVED HERE THIS DAY WITH FOUR ABLE-BODIED MEN
THE PARTICULARS OF HIS GOING ARE ON THIS WISE
COME THEN MEN OF PENNSYLVANIA COME AND JOIN US IN THIS GOOD WORK
ALTHOUGH ANXIOUS TO ENTER THE ANTI-SLAVERY FIELD AS A WORKER HER MODESTY PREVENTED HER FROM PRESSING HER CLAIMS
THIS HE REGARDED AS A VERY BAD SIGN
THE CAGE HE DENOUNCED AS A PERFECT HOG HOLE AND ADDED IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR HE ALSO SPOKE WITH EQUAL WARMTH ON THE PASS CUSTOM THE IDEA OF WORKING HARD ALL DAY AND THEN BEING OBLIGED TO HAVE A PASS ETC.,--HIS FEELINGS STERNLY REVOLTED AGAINST
SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD NOW TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE HER CLOTHES HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AND WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS SO
FURNESS WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON LEWIS TAPPAN ELIJAH F
IF THAT IS THE LAST NEWS YOU HAVE HAD FROM THEM I HAVE VERY PAINFUL INTELLIGENCE FOR YOU
THE HUMBLEST AND FEEBLEST OF US CAN DO SOMETHING
CINNAMON AND ODORS AND OINTMENTS AND FRANKINCENSE AND WINE AND OIL AND FINE FLOUR AND WHEAT AND BEASTS AND SHEEP AND HORSES AND CHARIOTS AND SLAVES AND SOULS OF MEN SLAVE-HOLDERS BELIEVED DOUBTLESS WERE THEIRS BY DIVINE RIGHT
HARPER ILLUSTRATION

BURLEIGH EDWARD HOPPER CHARLES WISE JOHN LONGSTRETH J.K
HIS FEELINGS ON BEING THUS SUNDERED NEED NOT BE STATED
MRS HILL IS QUITE SICK
THIS HEALTHY PROCESS OVER CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE CLOTHING WERE FURNISHED AND THE CHANGE IN THEIR APPEARANCE WAS SO MARKED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE PASSED AS STRANGERS IF NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE CORN-FIELDS OF THEIR MASTERS CERTAINLY AMONG MANY OF THEIR OLD ACQUAINTANCES UNLESS SUBJECTED TO THE MOST CAREFUL INSPECTION
SO ONE DAY THE MASTER LAID THE LAST STRAW ON THE CAMEL'S BACK AND NOT ANOTHER DAY WOULD HENRY STAY
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN USED WAS THE FIRST QUERY
NO DOUBT YOU TAKE GREAT PAINS TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH BUT CANNOT AT ALL TIMES AVOID BEING IMPOSED ON
NOT ONLY IN REGARD TO SLAVERY SAID THE PHILADELPHIA MORNING POST AT THE TIME BUT IN ALL THINGS WAS MR MOTT A REFORMER AND A RADICAL AND WHILE HIS PRINCIPLES WERE ABSOLUTE AND HIS OPINIONS UNCOMPROMISING HIS NATURE WAS SINGULARLY GENEROUS AND HUMANE
FROM THE TENOR OF THOMAS GARRETT'S LETTER THE COMMITTEE WAS PREPARED FOR A JOYFUL RECEPTION KNOWING THAT CAPTAIN F

WESLEY HARRIS ALIAS ROBERT JACKSON CRAVEN MATTERSON AND TWO BROTHERS
UNDER THESE HAPPY AUSPICES THE CASE CAME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AND GAVE RISE TO A HIGHLY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT ARGUMENT
HERE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR FURTHER DOUBT BUT MUCH NEED FOR VIGILANCE
HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM
IT WAS IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSEHOLD IN HIS YOUTH AND IN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD IN HIS MATURE YEARS THAT WAS FOSTERED THAT WEALTH OF LOVE AND AFFECTION WHICH EXTENDING AND WIDENING TOOK IN THE WHOLE RACE AND MADE HIM THE FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED EVERYWHERE AND ESPECIALLY OF THOSE WHOM IT WAS A DANGEROUS AND UNPOPULAR TASK TO BEFRIEND
QUARLES

I WAS MY MOTHER'S ONLY CHILD THUS SHE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT WHO WATCHED OVER HER DURING THESE EARLY HELPLESS YEARS
IN CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE METHODISTS--HIS MISTRESS WITH THE BAPTISTS

RICHMOND 16TH 1854
THE FUGITIVES THEMSELVES WHOSE FAITH AND HOPE HAD BEEN BUOYED UP BY THE PROMISES HELD UP TO THEM OF PROTECTION BEGAN TO BE APPREHENSIVE OF DANGER AND TALKED OF LEAVING WHILE OTHERS MORE BOLD WERE READY TO SET THE DANGERS THAT SURROUNDED THEM AT DEFIANCE AND IF NECESSARY DIE IN THE DEFENCE OF THEIR FREEDOM AND THE HOMES THEY HAD ACQUIRED
SHE HAD A HUSBAND AND HE HAD A MASTER AND THAT WAS RUM
IT'S HIGH TIME THE REIGN OF OPPRESSION WAS OVER EVER ALIVE TO THE WORK SHE WOULD APPEAL TO SUCH AS WERE ABLE AMONG HER FRIENDS TO TAKE STOCK IN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND WOULD SOMETIMES SUCCEED

I THINK NOT
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER A FREE WOMAN AND ONE SISTER IN SLAVERY
THE CONDITIONS OF SALE WERE THAT SHE WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE AND NEVER TO BE ALLOWED TO RETURN
NAY BUT LET HIM COME HERE WHERE HE CAN ENJOY THE RIGHTS OF A HUMAN BEING AND NOT TO BE TRODDEN UNDER THE FEET OF MEN LIKE THEMSELVES
HE SAYS HE IS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN SPEAKING OF HIS SLAVE LIFE WILLIAM SAID
WHEN HE LEFT HIS POOR WIFE JULIA SHE WAS THEN LYING IN PRISON TO BE SOLD ON THE SIMPLE CHARGE OF HAVING BEEN SUSPECTED OF CONNIVING AT HER HUSBAND'S ESCAPE
SO FOR FOUR MONTHS LIKE A TRUE AND EARNEST WOMAN SHE ENDURED A GREAT FIGHT OF AFFLICTION IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE
WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER I SUPPOSE SHE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
DAVID WAS THIRTY YEARS OF AGE BLACK WEIGHED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIVE POUNDS AND WAS WORTH ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
WILLIAM THOMAS COPE JOHN BOICE GREY HENRY BOICE AND ISAAC WHITE

ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS WALKS HE EVER TOOK--AND THEY HAD NOT BEEN A FEW--TO MEET AND ACCOMPANY PASSENGERS HE TOOK AT HALF PAST TWO O'CLOCK THAT MORNING TO THE DEPOT
THOSE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE AND WHO KEPT POSTED WITH REFERENCE TO THE FREQUENT CASES OF KIDNAPPING OCCURRING IN DIFFERENT FREE STATES ESPECIALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA DURING THE TWENTY YEARS PREVIOUS TO EMANCIPATION CANNOT FAIL TO REMEMBER THE KIDNAPPING OF RACHEL AND ELIZABETH PARKER AND THE MURDER OF JOSEPH C

BILL IS OF A DARKER COLOR ABOUT 5 FEET 8 INCHES IN HEIGHT STAMMERS A LITTLE WHEN CONFUSED WELL-MADE AND OLDER THAN JOE WELL DRESSED BUT MAY HAVE PULLED KEARSEY ON OVER THEIR OTHER CLOTHES
IT MIGHT BEEN SUPPOSED OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND BUT IT IS NOT SO
IN CAMDEN THEY WERE SHELTERED IN THE HOUSES OF THEIR COLORED FRIENDS
BY THIS MOST HAZARDOUS MODE OF TRAVEL HE REACHED VIRGINIA
HER EXAMPLE WAS AN INSPIRATION
HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR AND WAS APPARENTLY WELL SETTLED
HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHEN HE FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT
THE GLAMOUR OF BOOK-LORE WILL SPREAD OVER IT AND HIDE IT FROM HIS SIGHT
HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WHEN I LEFT HIM A RIGHT RED-LOOKING MAN BIG BELLIED OLD FELLOW WEIGHS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS
ON REACHING CHAMBERSBURG PA IN THE EVENING THEY DROVE TO A HOTEL THE LADY ALIGHTED HOLDING BY THE HAND HER WELL DRESSED AND NICE-LOOKING LITTLE DAUGHTER BEARING HERSELF WITH AS INDEPENDENT AN AIR AS IF SHE HAD OWNED TWENTY SUCH BOYS AS ACCOMPANIED HER AS COACHMAN

BUT WHEN WILLIAM REFLECTED AND SAW WHAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF ALL HIS LIFE BY BEING HELD IN BONDAGE AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO BREATHE FREE AIR WITH THE PROSPECT OF ENDING HIS DAYS ON FREE LAND HE REJOICED THAT HIS EYES HAD BEEN OPENED TO SEE HIS DANGER AND THAT HE HAD BEEN MOVED TO MAKE A START FOR LIBERTY
HANSON INSTEAD OF BEING ONLY THIRTY DECLARED THAT HE WAS THIRTY-SEVEN THE FIFTEENTH OF FEBRUARY
WE HAVE HAD WITHIN THE LAST WEEK JUST NINETEEN UNDERGROUND PASSENGERS
FOR EIGHT MONTHS HE LONGED TO GET AWAY AND HAD NO REST UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
A CERTAIN JOSIAH WILSON OWNED THOMAS
AT THE SAME TIME THE COMMITTEE ASSURED HIM IF HE WERE WILLING TO HAVE HIS MASTER ARRESTED AND BROUGHT BEFORE ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE CITY TO SHOW CAUSE WHY HE HELD HIM A SLAVE IN PENNSYLVANIA CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE THAT HE SHOULD LACK NEITHER FRIENDS NOR MONEY TO AID HIM IN THE MATTER
HE WAS A MEMBER OF ALBANY CHAPEL AT MASSEY'S CROSS ROADS AND A SLAVE OF DR B
THEY CONCLUDED HOWEVER THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE THEIR CONDITION ANY WORSE LET CIRCUMSTANCES BE WHAT THEY MIGHT IN THIS RESPECT
WHEN INTENSELY INTERESTED HIS EYE WAS FULL OF DEEP AND PIERCING EXPRESSION
AFTER I WOULDN'T DO THAT HE WENT AND GOT HIS GUN
ARRAH WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
CONWAY WHO RESIDED IN BALTIMORE AND DERIVED HER SUPPORT FROM THE LABOR OF SLAVES WHOM SHE KEPT HIRED OUT AS WAS GEORGE
HENRY SMALLWOOD SAW THAT HE WAS WORKING EVERY DAY FOR NOTHING AND THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD DO BETTER
HE NEVER EXPECTS OR DESIRES TO DO LESS

LEWIS WAS DESCRIBED AS A LIGHT YELLOW MAN MEDIUM SIZE GOOD-LOOKING AND INTELLIGENT

THE CHAIRMAN'S CALL WAS RESPONDED TO BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE LIFTING UP THEIR HANDS
WHILE THE FEELING OF THE SPECTATORS WAS IN THIS STATE OF INTENSE INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT THE JUDGE STERN AND INFLEXIBLE IN HIS PURPOSES AND THE CLAN OF GREEDY CLAIMANTS READY TO SEIZE UPON THEIR PREY THE SHERIFF PRODUCED HIS WRIT OF CERTIORARI AND HANDED IT TO THE COURT
INDEED EVERY STEP THEY TOOK PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT THEY WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT WITH REGARD TO BOAT SEARCHING
JOSEPH WAS A FAIR SPECIMEN OF A MAN PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY COULD READ AND WRITE AND THEREBY KEEP THE RUN OF MATTERS OF INTEREST ON THE SLAVERY QUESTION
HAWKINS AND FAMILY ARRIVE IN WILMINGTON
BALL OSCAR D 399
WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MR MCKIM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO WELCOME IT AS THE HARBINGER OF THE SLAVE'S DELIVERANCE AND THE COUNTRY'S REDEMPTION
THE MARSHAL HOWEVER WAS STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF BEING A FRIEND OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND TO ADD NOW THAT THOSE SUSPICIONS WERE FOUNDED ON FACT WILL DOUBTLESS DO HIM NO DAMAGE

EMELINE CHAPMAN SO PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED IN THE BALTIMORE SUN OF THE 23D OF SEPTEMBER 1856 ARRIVED BY THE REGULAR UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TRAIN FROM WASHINGTON
THE LAST NAMED WAS A CONSTABLE AND USED TO ASSIST THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MANAGERS BY PRETENDING TO HUNT FUGITIVES WITH THE KIDNAPPERS
I HAVE GIVEN JOHNSON FIVE DOLLARS WHICH WILL PAY ALL EXPENSES AND LEAVE EACH TWENTY-FIVE CENTS
WHEN HE WAS QUITE SMALL HE REMEMBERED SEEING HIS MISTRESS BUT NOT SINCE
NONE OF THESE CAN WALK SO FAR OR SO FAST AS SCORES OF MEN THAT ARE CONSTANTLY LEAVING
IN THIS DREADFUL CRISIS MR MCKIM WITH HIS USUAL GOOD JUDGMENT AND REMARKABLY QUICK STRATEGICAL MIND ESPECIALLY IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE U.G.R.R HIT UPON THE FOLLOWING PLAN NAMELY TO GO TO HIS FRIEND E.M

NEVERTHELESS ANTHONY FELT THAT HE WOULD NOT MURMUR AS HE KNEW WHAT SUFFERING WAS PRETTY WELL AND ESPECIALLY AS HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WOULD BE FREE IN ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF--THE USUAL TIME IT TOOK THE STEAMER TO MAKE HER TRIP
SUCH INSPECTION SHALL BE MADE WITHIN TWELVE HOURS OF THE TIME OF DEPARTURE OF SUCH VESSEL FROM THE WATERS OF VIRGINIA AND MAY BE MADE IN ANY BAY RIVER CREEK OR OTHER WATER-COURSE OF THE STATE PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT STEAMERS PLYING AS REGULAR PACKETS BETWEEN PORTS IN VIRGINIA AND THOSE NORTH OF AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAPES OF VIRGINIA SHALL BE INSPECTED AT THE PORT OF DEPARTURE NEAREST OLD POINT COMFORT
CYRUS IS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE STOUT AND UNMISTAKABLY DARK AND WAS OWNED BY JAMES K
HIS EARLIEST BIOGRAPHER WAS MARY HOWITT
HAD THE IDEA THEN BEEN ENTERTAINED THAT THE NARRATIVE OF THIS YOUNG SLAVE-WARRIOR WAS TO BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THE MANNER AND TIME THAT IT NOW IS A FAR MORE THRILLING ACCOUNT OF HIS ADVENTURES MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
HE SPOKE OF HIS MISTRESS AS A VERY CLEVER LADY TO HER SERVANTS BUT SINCE HER DEATH HE HAD REALIZED THE DANGER THAT HE WAS IN OF BEING RUN OFF SOUTH WITH A COFFLE GANG
IT IS THE RULE OF THIS OFFICE TO REQUIRE BONDS FOR ALL NEGROES APPLYING FOR TICKETS TO GO NORTH AND NONE BUT GENTLEMEN OF WELL-KNOWN RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE TAKEN FURTHER EXPLAINED THE TICKET MASTER
I MAY AS A CHRISTIAN LAMENT THAT THEIR VIEWS OF DUTY ARE NOT MORE IN UNISON WITH MY OWN
HE HAD SERVED ON THE FARM AS A COMMON FARM LABORER
WAS KIND-HEARTED AND NOBLY MANIFESTED A WILLINGNESS TO DO ALL THAT SHE COULD FOR THEIR SAFETY
WILLIAM GAVE SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE AT FIRST SIGHT THAT HE WAS OPPOSED TO THE UNREQUITED LABOR SYSTEM IN TOTO AND EVEN HATED STILL MORE THE FLOGGING PRACTICES OF THE CHIVALRY
THE POSTERITY OF THE OPPRESSED AT LEAST WILL NEED SUCH EVIDENCES OF TENDER REGARD AND LOVE AS HERE EVINCED
SIR:--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF INFORMING YOU THAT WE ARE IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HOPE YOU ARE THE SAME I WROTE A LETTER TO YOU ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO AND HAVE NOT YET HAD AN ANSWER TO IT I WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT THE WEDDING TOOK PLACE ON TUESDAY LAST AND MRS HALL NOW SENDS HER BEST LOVE TO YOU I ENCLOSE A LETTER WHICH I WISH YOU TO FORWARD TO MR MAYO YOU WILL SEE IN HIS LETTER WHAT I HAVE SAID TO HIM AND I WISH YOU WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH SUCH DIRECTIONS AS IT REQUIRES FOR HIM TO SEND THEM THINGS TO YOU
AS HE HAD GIVEN THE MATTER HIS FULLEST ATTENTION FOR A LONG TIME HE WAS PREPARED TO MAKE RAPID PROGRESS WHEN HE DID START AND AS HE HAD NO GREAT DISTANCE TO TRAVEL IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT WHILE HIS MASTER WAS ONE NIGHT SLEEPING SOUNDLY THIS YOUNG PIECE OF PROPERTY WORTH AT LEAST $1,000 IN THE MARKET WAS CROSSING MASON AND DIXON'S LINE AND STEERING DIRECTLY FOR CANADA
THE NECESSITY OF AVOIDING THE POLICE WAS THE ONLY THING HOWEVER WHICH EVER FORCED HIM INTO ANY SECRECY IN HIS OPERATIONS AND IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS HE WAS WITHOUT CONCEALMENT AND WITHOUT COMPROMISE IN HIS OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY
AGED ABOUT TWENTY-ONE YEARS
HENRY STEWART WHO ACCOMPANIED THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRAVELER TO CANADA HAD FLED A SHORT WHILE BEFORE FROM PLYMOUTH NORTH CAROLINA
CYRUS WHITSON A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IN MR MCKIM'S JUDGMENT COULD MANAGE THE MATTER SUCCESSFULLY

OTHERS WITH INDOMITABLE ZEAL TOOK UP THE WORK AND FINALLY AFTER A SUCCESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS FROM CAUSES WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE WOMAN'S COLLEGE ON NORTH COLLEGE AVENUE PHILADELPHIA STARTING FROM THE GERM OF HIS THOUGHT ENTERED ON THE CAREER OF PROSPERITY IT IS SO WELL ENTITLED TO RECEIVE

THE LOCALITY OF COLUMBIA WHERE MR WHIPPER RESIDED FOR MANY YEARS WAS AS IS WELL-KNOWN A PLACE OF MUCH NOTE AS A STATION ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IN THESE LETTERS MAY BE SEEN HOW MUCH LIBERTY WAS VALUED HOW THE TASTE OF FREEDOM MOVED THE PEN OF THE SLAVE
WHEN A SMALL BOY HE RESOLVED THAT HE NEVER WOULD WORK ALL HIS DAYS AS A SLAVE FOR THE WHITE PEOPLE
THE CHILD WAS GIVEN AS A PRESENT TO A NIECE OF THE MASTER
THE SAME DUTY ALSO RESTED WITH WEIGHT UPON THE MIND OF DAVID
THE NEXT MORNING HIS FATHER THOMAS WILLIAMSON BROUGHT THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS WHICH HAD BEEN SERVED AT PASSMORE'S OFFICE AFTER HE LEFT TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE
WHO IS THE HEAD OF YOUR VIGILANCE COMMITTEE WHOM I MAY ADDRESS CONCERNING OTHER AND FURTHER OPERATIONS
AG'T PETERSBURG VA OCT
THE COMMITTEE ATTENDED TO HIS WANTS AND FORWARDED HIM ON AS USUAL
LEWIS WAS A BAPTIST AND BELONGED TO THE SECOND CHURCH
THESE MEN KNEW THAT THEY WERE OF GREATER SERVICE TO THE CAUSE BY BEING ITS BODY-GUARD BY STANDING BETWEEN IT AND THE PUBLIC BY MAKING THE APPEALS AND TAKING THE BLOWS AND BY AFFORDING ACCESS PECUNIARY AND OTHER OF EACH TO EACH
SUCH A SPEECH REDEEMS THE LONG INFAMY OF THE STATE
SAID WASHINGTON ON ONE OCCASION ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE I WAS SECRETED HE HAD FIVE OF THE SLAVES SOME OF THEM WOMEN TIED ACROSS A BARREL LASHED WITH THE COW-HIDE AND THEN COBBED--THIS WAS A COMMON PRACTICE SUCH TREATMENT WAS SO INHUMAN AND SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE COMMITTEE HESITATED AT FIRST TO GIVE CREDENCE TO THE STATEMENT AND ONLY YIELDED WHEN FACTS AND EVIDENCES WERE GIVEN WHICH SEEMED INCONTESTIBLE

MY THREE OTHER COMPANIONS WHO WERE CAPTURED WERE SENT TO WESTMINSTER JAIL WHERE THEY WERE KEPT THREE WEEKS AND AFTERWARDS SENT TO BALTIMORE AND SOLD FOR TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A PIECE AS I WAS INFORMED WHILE AT THE TAVERN IN TERRYTOWN ILLUSTRATION
HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DEAD THE EXCITEMENT OVER THE ESCAPE SPREAD VERY RAPIDLY NEXT MORNING AND DESPERATE EFFORTS WERE MADE TO RECAPTURE THE FUGITIVES BUT A FEW FRIENDS THERE WERE WHO HAD SYMPATHY AND IMMEDIATELY RENDERED THEM THE NEEDED ASSISTANCE
PERHAPS TO ALLOW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECOVERING FROM FATIGUE AND RECRUITING EXHAUSTED STRENGTH OR FOR EARNING MEANS TO PURSUE THE JOURNEY BY THE COMMON RAILROADS,--IT WAS OFTEN THOUGHT ADVISABLE THAT PASSENGERS SHOULD REMAIN WITH THEM FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD
DECEMBER 29TH 1854--JOHN IS TWENTY YEARS OF AGE CHESTNUT COLOR OF SPARE BUILD AND SMART
DEAR SIR MY WIFE WILL BE ON TO PHILADELPHIA ON THE 8TH 7TH AND I WOULD YOU TO LOOK OUT FOR HER AND GET HER AN TICKET AND SEND HER TO ME TORONTO

YET IT HAS PERISHED
WELL FRIEND STILL WE LEARNT THAT MR MINKENS COULD NOT BRING HER THE ACCOUNT OF HER CHILD

I WAS EYES TO THE BLIND AND FEET WAS I TO THE LAME
HEAR HEAR I HAVE INDEED OFTEN HEARD IT SAID IN DEPRECATION OF THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST WHICH WAS BESTOWED IN THIS COUNTRY ON THE CAUSE OF NEGRO EMANCIPATION IN AMERICA THAT WE ARE APT TO FORGET THE FORMS OF SUFFERING WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY AT OUR OWN DOORS OVER WHICH WE HAVE SOME CONTROL AND TO EXPRESS EXAGGERATED FEELING AS TO THE FORMS OF SUFFERING WITH WHICH WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO AND FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE
ALTHOUGH HIS EDUCATION HAD BEEN LIMITED AND HIS PURSUITS AFFORDED HIM BUT LITTLE LEISURE TIME YET HE INDULGED HIS FONDNESS FOR READING AND EXHIBITED A REFINED LITERARY TASTE IN HIS SELECTIONS
THEY WERE ALL FREE BUT ELIZA
THEREFORE WAS HE INTERESTED IN THE CAUSE OF THE INDIANS
HIS EAGERNESS TO FIND A CONDUCTOR THEN WOULD BECOME ALMOST PAINFUL
HE ROAD CAMDEN CIRCUIT THIS MAN LED THEM IN DOVER PRISIN AND LEFT THEM WITH A WHIT MAN
THEY FURNISH WORK FOR POOR WOMEN AND SELL IT
HE HAD BEEN CLOTHED MEANLY AND POORLY FED HE ALSO ALLEGED THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS WORSE THAN HIS MASTER AS SHE WOULD THINK NOTHING OF KNOCKING AND BEATING THE SLAVE WOMEN FOR NOTHING JOHN WAS OWNED BY THOMAS MURPHY
THEN I WAS SOLD WITH MY CHILD A BOY THUS AUNT HANNAH REVIEWED HER SLAVE-LIFE SHOWING THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF SIX DIFFERENT OWNERS AND HAD SEEN GREAT TRIBULATION UNDER EACH OF THEM EXCEPT THE LAST

FULL PARTICULARS OF THE ABDUCTION ENSLAVING AND ESCAPE OF DAVIS
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER MORE THAN ONCE SINCE SHE RAN AWAY UNTIL SHE WAS ARRESTED
SUNDRY ARRIVALS LATTER PART OF DECEMBER 1855 AND BEGINNING OF JANUARY 1856
IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO TRY TO MAKE SOME PROVISION FOR THE ARTICLE TO BE SENT BUT IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO DO SO THE BUNDLE HAS BEEN ON MY HANDS NOW GOING ON 3 YEARS AND I HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL OF DANGER AND IS STILL SUFFERING THE SAME
ON THE OTHER HAND THE MOTHER WAS AWARE THAT THE SAFETY OF HERSELF AND HER RESCUED CHILDREN DEPENDED ON KEEPING THE WHOLE TRANSACTION A STRICT FAMILY SECRET
WE HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED IN RECEIVING TWO LETTERS RESPECTING THEM FROM ONE OF THEIR EXCELLENT PASTORS JOHN G
THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE IN PHILADELPHIA AND ELSEWHERE DEEPLY SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM IN THIS DREADFUL HOUR
SURE I AM THAT THESE SENTIMENTS WILL BE HEARTILY RECIPROCATED BY MY COUNTRYMEN
SPEEDILY REACHING OUR HOUSE SHE HID HERSELF AWAY DURING THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING AS A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOUSE OF OUR UNCLE DR FUSSELL THEN RESIDING ON AN ADJOINING FARM
BEFORE HE WAS IN MARYLAND FIVE YEARS HE BOUGHT SLAVES BECAME A REGULAR SLAVE-HOLDER GOT TO DRINKING AND RACING HORSES AND WAS VERY BAD--TREATED ALL HANDS BAD HIS WIFE TOO SO THAT SHE HAD TO LEAVE HIM AND GO TO PHILADELPHIA TO HER KINSFOLKS
TO DIE IN THE WOODS LIVE IN A CAVE OR SACRIFICE HIMSELF IN SOME WAY HE WAS BOUND TO DO RATHER THAN REMAIN A SLAVE
OF HIS VIEWS OF CANADA AND FREEDOM THE FOLLOWING FRANK AND SENSIBLE LETTER PENNED SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL SPEAKS FOR ITSELF TORONTO MARCH 6TH 1854
ONE DAY IN HAPPENING TO SEE HIS MASTER'S BOOK HE NOTICED THAT WHEREVER FIVE AND ONE WERE ADDED THE FIGURE 6 WAS USED
HER TOIL BODY AND STRENGTH WERE CLAIMED BY THOMAS ECKELS ESQ A MAN OF WEALTH AND LIKEWISE A MAN OF INTEMPERANCE
YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SEEING MR BROWN AND ASK HIM IF HE WOULD OBLIGE ME BY GOING TO RICHMOND AND SEE MY WIFE AND SEE WHAT ARRANGEMENTS HE COULD MAKE WITH HER AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY ALL HIS EXPENSES THERE AND BACK
AMBY NAT 102
WE HATE TO BE PUT DOWN BY THE INFLUENCE OF TYRANNY AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE OUR SORROW ANXIETY NECESSITY AND DETERMINATION I HAVE RECEIVED SINCE THE PRESS WAS DESTROYED 700 DOLLARS IN ALL WHICH HAS BEEN SPENT IN REPAIRING AND ROOFING OUR DWELLING-HOUSE AND REPAIRING THE BREACHES MADE UPON THE OFFICE TOGETHER WITH MENDING THE PRESSES AND PROCURING JOB TYPE AND SOME LITTLE FOR THE PAPER BUT NEARLY ALL THE LATTER IS OLD TYPE
HIS MASTER WAS A BACHELOR A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE MEANS AND KEPT TOLERABLE GOOD COMPANY AND ONLY OWNED TWO OTHER SLAVES RACHEL ANN DUMBSON AND JOHN PRICE
BUT WAS NOT SUCH AN EVENT WORTHY THE AWAKENING OF EVERY POWER--THE CONGRATULATION OF EVERY FACULTY
GEORGE WAS OF A VERY DARK HUE BUT NOT QUITE UP TO MEDIUM SIZE
WE SOON ENTERED THE HOUSE AND AFTER THE FIRST GUSH OF FEELING HAD SOMEWHAT SUBSIDED THEY BOTH BEGAN A GENERAL INQUIRY ABOUT THE FRIENDS THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND
WELL E THEE IS PREPARING TO GO TO THE WEST THE FRIEND REPLIED
I TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BUT NOTHING MORE

ROHINSON 286
THIS WELL-EXERCISED SAGACITY WAS STRONGLY MARKED IN THE INTELLECTUAL REGION OF WILLIAM'S HEAD
BLACKSON JAS
I ENCLOSE THE ONLY PAPER THAT WE HAVE PRINTED THAT THOU MAYEST SEE THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR
ELIZABETH WAS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE CHESTNUT COLOR AND OF CONSIDERABLE NATURAL INTELLECT
SHE WILL REMAIN HERE UNTIL SHE CAN HEAR FROM YOU
ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THE PASSENGERS JUST DESCRIBED RECEIVED SUCCOR ELIZABETH LAMBERT WITH THREE CHILDREN REACHED THE COMMITTEE
THE WRITER TURNED TO HIM AND INQUIRED I SUPPOSE YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT THE DR WENT TO WASHINGTON AFTER ARE YOU NOT NO SAID JOE WHERE ARE YOU FROM THEN WAS THE NEXT QUESTION

I BADE GOOD-BYE TO THE OLD TOBACCO FACTORY ON SEVENTH STREET AND THE FIRST AFRICAN BAPTIST CHURCH ON BROAD STREET WHERE HE BELONGED WHERE I HAD SO OFTEN HEARD THE MINISTER PREACH SERVANTS OBEY YOUR MASTERS ALSO TO THE SLAVE PENS CHAIN-GANGS AND A CRUEL MASTER AND MISTRESS ALL OF WHICH I HOPED TO LEAVE FOREVER
AT THIS POINT INSTEAD OF GETTING HIS FREE PAPERS AS HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HE SHOULD TO HIS SURPRISE ONE DAY HE SAW A NOTORIOUS TRADER APPROACHING THE SHOP WHERE HE WAS AT WORK
HE STATED THAT HE WAS OWNED BY AN ENGRAVER KNOWN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM STONE AND ADDED THAT HIMSELF AND SEVEN OTHERS WERE KEPT WORKING ON THE FARM OF SAID STONE FOR NOTHING
PLEASE LET ME HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
IN THOSE DAYS ALL POWER WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE OPPRESSOR AND THE CAPTURE OF A SLAVE MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN WAS ATTENDED WITH NO GREAT DIFFICULTY OTHER THAN THE CRUSHING OF FREEDOM IN THE BREAST OF THE VICTIMS
TOPSHAM VT DECEMBER 18TH 1856
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD BE FREE ONE SUNDAY MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT AN OFFICER BELONGING TO SAVANNAH GA HAD STARTED FOR NEW YORK IN PURSUIT OF TWO YOUNG MEN OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WHO HAD BEEN SLAVES OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PHYSICIANS OF THE PLACE AND WHO HAD ESCAPED AND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN NEW YORK

THOMAS SHIPLEY
WHETHER MR PATTISON SUSPENDED ON SUDDENLY LEARNING THAT HE WAS MINUS FIFTEEN HEAD THE WRITER CANNOT SAY
YOU WILL PLEASE TO LET ME HEAR FROM YOU
HIS MASTER WAS ABOUT EIGHTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND WAS REGARDED AS KIND THOUGH HE HAD SOLD SOME OF HIS SLAVES AND WAS IN FAVOR OF SLAVERY
BELINDA BIVANS

IN POINT OF INTEREST HOWEVER HIS CASE IS NO MORE REMARKABLE THAN MANY OTHERS
CHARLES 208
ELIZABETH WHO HAD BEEN SOLD TO PARTIES IN NEW ORLEANS WAS SENT FOR BY CAMPBELL AMPLE SECURITY HAVING BEEN GIVEN THAT SHE SHOULD BE RETURNED IF PROVED TO BE A SLAVE
ALTHOUGH I KNOW SOME OF THE RESIDENTS OF LOUDON COUNTY AND HAVE OFTEN VISITED THERE STILL I HAVE NOT PRACTICED MUCH IN THE COURTS OF THAT COUNTY
THE MAIN THEME OF HER DISCOURSE THE ONE STRING TO THE HARMONY OF WHICH ALL THE OTHERS WERE ATTUNED WAS THE GRAND OPPORTUNITY THAT EMANCIPATION HAD AFFORDED TO THE BLACK RACE TO LIFT ITSELF TO THE LEVEL OF THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ENJOINED BY IT
SHE WAS BORN IN 1793 IN THE ISLAND OF NANTUCKET AND IS DESCENDED FROM THE COFFINS AND MACYS ON THE FATHER'S SIDE AND FROM THE FOLGERS ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE AND THROUGH THEM IS RELATED TO DR BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD OFFERED
BUT FOR THE MEAN TREATMENT RECEIVED FROM MR JAY MAJOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO HAVE REMAINED ALL HIS DAYS IN CHAINS
THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS GOING DOWN STAIRS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OFFICERS HIS OLD CALICO DRESS BONNET AND RIG ATTRACTING NO FURTHER ATTENTION THAN SIMPLY TO ELICIT THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE QUESTIONS
LIFE WITHOUT THE COARSER ATTRIBUTES OF MEN THE DULL AND MOMENTLY DECAYING FRAME WHICH HOLDS THE ETHEREAL SPIRIT IN AND BINDS IT DOWN TO BROTHERHOOD WITH BRUTES

TRUE WILLIAM WAS SAID TO BELONG TO JUDGE WOODEN OF GEORGETOWN DEL BUT ACCORDING TO THE STORY OF HIS CHATTEL THE JUDGE WAS NOT OF THE CLASS WHO JUDGED RIGHTEOUSLY
UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORD
AN ATTACK OF ILLNESS WAS THE RESULT OF THE EXTREME EXERTION AND FATIGUE ENDURED BY THIS DEVOTED MAN IN HIS EARNEST ADVOCACY OF THE RIGHTS OF THESE FRIENDLESS BEINGS
IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT CURSINGS AND THREATENINGS WERE BREATHED OUT BY A DEEPLY AGITATED COMMUNITY FOR DAYS IN SUCCESSION
AND IN THE EYES OF THIS CHIVALRIC COURT THIS PROCEDURE WAS ALL RIGHT BUT THANK GOD THE EVENTS SINCE THOSE DARK AND DREADFUL DAYS AFFORD ABUNDANT PROOF THAT THE ALL-SEEING EYE WAS NOT ASLEEP TO THE DAILY SUFFERINGS OF THE POOR BONDMAN
ONE DAY SHE BEAT ME AS BAD AS HE DID

HALL JOHN 502
JANE DOUBTLESS REPRESENTED THOUSANDS OF OLD SLAVE MOTHERS WHO AFTER HAVING BEEN WORN OUT UNDER THE YOKE WERE FREQUENTLY EITHER OFFERED FOR SALE FOR A TRIFLE TURNED OFF TO DIE OR COMPELLED TO EKE OUT THEIR EXISTENCE ON THE MOST STINTED ALLOWANCE
WE HAD RESOLVED TO GO TO THEIR AID ON MONDAY AS THE TRIAL WAS SET FOR THURSDAY
AS THEY WERE THEN ENTERED ON THE RECORD SO IN LIKE MANNER ARE THE NOTES MADE OF THEM TRANSFERRED TO THESE PAGES
MOST OF OUR READERS WILL BE AWARE THAT W.S
BEING A MAN OF THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY ABILITIES HE HAD GIVEN THE MATTER OF HIS BONDAGE CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT AND SEEING THAT HIS MASTER GOT WORSE THE OLDER HE GOT TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE HAD RECENTLY BEEN SOLD HE WAS STRONGLY STIRRED TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR CANADA
THE YOUNG LAD WAS SITTING QUITE COMPOSEDLY IN THE DINING-ROOM WITH HIS CAP ON
LITTLE DREAMING THAT IN LESS THAN THREE SHORT YEARS--"THEREFORE SHALL HER PLAGUES COME IN ONE DAY DEATH AND MOURNING AND FAMINE IN VIEW OF THE MARVELOUS CHANGES WHICH HAVE BEEN WROUGHT BY THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY THIS WARNING TO SLAVE-HOLDERS FROM ONE WHO FELT THE STING OF SLAVERY AS EVINCING A PARTICULAR PHASE OF SIMPLE FAITH AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY IS ENTITLED TO A PLACE IN THESE RECORDS
SHE WAS HAUNTED BY THE CONSTANT THOUGHT OF AGAIN BEING SOLD AS SHE HAD ONCE BEEN AND AS SHE HAD WITNESSED THE SALE OF HER SISTER'S FOUR CHILDREN AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER
PENNINGTON
PENNINGTON
ALTHOUGH HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED VERY BADLY AND HAD EVEN SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM BEING SHAMEFULLY BEATEN HE HAD HOWEVER BEEN PERMITTED TO HIRE HIS TIME BY THE YEAR FOR WHICH ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS WERE REGULARLY DEMANDED BY HIS OWNER
CANBY

AS ARCHER HAD BEEN SICKLY MOST OF THE TIME DURING THE LAST YEAR HE COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS NO REDUCTION IN HIS HIRE ON THIS ACCOUNT
JOHN HOWEVER DID NOT LIVE IN THE CITY WITH SAID STEVENS BUT ON THE FARM NEAR FREDERICK'S MILLS MONTGOMERY COUNTY MARYLAND
WOULD GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY COME HOME AND GO TO FIGHTING AMONGST THE COLORED PEOPLE
IN THIS SAD CASE THE SLAVES COULD IMAGINE NO OTHER FATE THAN SOON TO BE TORN ASUNDER AND SCATTERED
THE VICTORY WAS THEN COMPLETE EQUALLY AS MUCH SO AS AT CHRISTIANA
I THINK I SHOULD DELIBERATELY LOOKING AROUND AMONGST ALL THE FREIGHT HE DISCOVERED THE BOX AND SAID I THINK THAT IS IT THERE SAID OFFICER STEPPED TO IT LOOKED AT THE DIRECTIONS ON IT THEN AT THE BILL OF LADING AND SAID THAT IS RIGHT TAKE IT ALONG HERE THE INTEREST IN THESE TWO BOSOMS WAS THRILLING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
ALSO A SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME OLD ADVERTISEMENT OF A BEAR BAIT THAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN EMMITTSBURG MARYLAND
AS MR ROBERT DADE WAS ALSO A LOSER EQUALLY WITH MR THOMAS B
HE SAID 80 WHITE STREET AND I HAVE RUN HERE TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY GIVE NOTICE TO A MAN WHO HAS ESCAPED FROM MY MASTER TO THIS CITY THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS JOURNEY IS TO FIND HIM AND TAKE HIM BACK TO SLAVERY THE MAN HURRIED BACK SO THAT HE NEED NOT BE MISSED BY HIS MASTER WHO BELIEVED THAT THIS COACHMAN WHO HAD LIVED YEARS WITH HIM WAS HIS CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT AND WOULD BE TRUE TO HIS INTEREST
MY OLD MASTER WAS A VERY SEVERE MAN BUT HE WAS ALWAYS VERY KIND TO ME
NO GLEAM OF HOPE APPEARED YET HE WOULD NOT SUFFER HIMSELF TO THINK OF RETURNING TO BONDAGE
SHE HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE LATE LITTLETON REEVES WHOM SHE REPRESENTED AS HAVING BEEN KIND TO HER MUCH MORE SO THAN HER MISTRESS MRS REEVES SAID MARY SHE BEING OF A JEALOUS DISPOSITION CAUSED ME TO BE HIRED OUT WITH A HARD FAMILY WHERE I WAS MUCH ABUSED FREQUENTLY FLOGGED AND STINTED FOR FOOD ETC
THE PRINCIPLE OF ABSTINENCE FROM SLAVE PRODUCE MAY BE SMILED AT BUT WE ARE QUITE SURE IT IS AN HONEST ONE AND AS A GOOD OLD PROVERB OBSERVES IT TAKES A GREAT MANY BUSHELS FULL OF EARTH TO BURY A TRUTH BUT WHILE THIS SELF-DENYING PROTEST HAS BEEN GOING ON IN A FEW LIMITED CIRCLES HOW GREAT IS THE ADVANCE THAT FREE LABOR HAS BEEN MAKING WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS
BUT THE OLD BLIND FATHER OF JACKSON ISAAC AND EDMONDSON STILL LIVES AND MAY BE SEEN DAILY ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA

BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS ATTEMPT THE UNDERTAKING PROVED A FAILURE
AND UNTIL COLORED MEN MANAGE BY DINT OF HARD ACQUISITION TO ENTER THE RANKS OF SKILLED INDUSTRY VERY LITTLE SUBSTANTIAL RESPECT WILL BE SHOWN THEM EVEN WITH THE BALLOT-BOX AND MUSKET IN THEIR HANDS
ON THE 4TH DAY OF AUGUST 1810
IF IN THE PROGRESS OF THEM YOU SHALL FIND THAT MEN HAVE BEEN AMONG US WHO UNDER WHATEVER MASK OF CONSCIENCE OR OF PEACE HAVE LABORED TO INCITE OTHERS TO TREASONABLE VIOLENCE AND WHO AFTER ARRANGING THE ELEMENTS OF THE MISCHIEF HAVE WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES TO AWAIT THE EXPLOSION THEY HAD CONTRIVED YOU WILL FEEL YOURSELVES BOUND TO PRESENT THE FACT TO THE COURT,--AND HOWEVER DISTANT MAY BE THE PLACE IN WHICH THE OFFENDERS MAY HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE WE GIVE YOU THE PLEDGE OF THE LAW THAT ITS FAR-REACHING ENERGIES SHALL BE EXERTED TO BRING THEM UP FOR TRIAL,--IF GUILTY TO PUNISHMENT
CAN ANYTHING BE DONE FOR THE RESCUE OF THIS GIRL FROM THE KIDNAPPERS
HE SHALL KEEP A RECORD OF ALL VESSELS ENGAGED IN THE PILOTING BUSINESS TOGETHER WITH A LIST OF SUCH PERSONS AS MAY BE EMPLOYED AS PILOTS AND INSPECTORS UNDER THIS LAW
I WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS-OLD WHEN I ENGAGED IN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BUSINESS AND I CONTINUED THEREIN DILIGENTLY UNTIL THE BREAKING UP OF THAT BUSINESS BY THE GREAT REBELLION
THE FACT THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS PARENTS THREE BROTHERS AND FIVE SISTERS ALL IN SLAVERY BROUGHT SAD REFLECTIONS
HE DETERMINED THAT HIS YOUNG MASTER SHOULD NEVER GET FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY UNLESS HE GOT THEM WHILE HE ANTHONY WAS RUNNING
SHE OFTEN SPEAKS OF YOUR KINDNESS TO HER
WILLIAM STILL FOR MANY YEARS CONNECTED WITH THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE IN PHILADELPHIA AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ACTING VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF THE PHILADELPHIA BRANCH OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD HAS WRITTEN A PONDEROUS VOLUME ENTITLED THE UNDERGROUND RALROAD

AND IN THAT SEVEN YEARS HE REMEMBERS RECEIVING FROM HIM FIFTY CENTS
SO MANY IMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN PALMED OFF UPON CHARITABLE ABOLITIONISTS I AM AFRAID TO ACT IN SUCH A CASE WITHOUT THE DIRECTIONS OF ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT THESE THINGS
THEN HE MIGHT PURSUE HIS JOURNEY WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN
IT MUST BE ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS GATHERED FROM A HASTY SURVEY OF HIS ROUGH AND RUGGED APPEARANCE HIS LARGE HEAD LARGE MOUTH LARGE EYES AND HEAVY EYE-BROWS WITH A NATURAL GIFT AT KEEPING CONCEALED THE INNER-WORKINGS OF HIS MIND AND FEELINGS WERE NOT CALCULATED TO INSPIRE THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS FITTED TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE LIVES OF UNPROTECTED FEMALES AND HELPLESS CHILDREN
HOW MUCH ONE NEEDS THE SPIRIT OF OUR DEAR MASTER TO MAKE ONE'S LIFE A LIVING LOVING FORCE TO HELP MEN TO HIGHER PLANES OF THOUGHT AND ACTION
HE WAS NEAR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND WAS SURE TO FIND IT SOONER OR LATER

WILLIAM APPEARED UNMOVED
AND THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN ASSISTED TO GET OFF IN THAT WAY ALONG WITH THE OTHER BOY HIRED TO THE MESSRS

SO THAT NIGHT HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FOR BAY SHORE
FOR EACH SLAVE OVER FIVE AND UNDER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE SUM OF SIXTY DOLLARS

FROM THIS TIME FORWARD HE NEVER FAILED TO ASSIST ANY FUGITIVE FROM SLAVERY ON THE WAY TO FREEDOM AND OF COURSE AFTER HIS REMOVAL TO THIS CITY HIS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS WERE GREATLY INCREASED AND IN COURSE OF TIME HIS HOUSE BECAME KNOWN AS ONE OF THE REFUGES FOR FUGITIVES
IN ESCAPING SHE HAD TO LEAVE HER POOR OLD MOTHER WITH NO HOPE OF EVER SEEING HER AGAIN

ROBERT THOMPSON A PREACHER SLAVERY EXEMPTED FROM THE YOKE NO MAN WITH A COLORED SKIN NO MATTER WHAT HIS FAITH TALENT GENIUS OR WORTH MIGHT BE
HE MUST LABOR THROUGH OTHERS HE MUST INSPIRE THEM CONVINCE THE UNBELIEVING KINDLE THE FIRES OF FAITH IN DOUBTING SOULS AND IN THE UNEQUAL FIGHT OF RIGHT WITH WRONG MAKE HOPE TAKE THE PLACE OF DESPAIR
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE OF A PURE BLACK COLOR IN STATURE MEDIUM SIZE AND WELL-MADE
JOHN PROFESSED TO KNOW NOTHING
AT THE LONDON BREAKFAST WHERE JOHN BRIGHT PRESIDED AND JOHN STUART MILL THE DUKE OF ARGYLL AND OTHERS SPOKE HE SAID WHEN CALLED UPON TO REPLY
THEY THEN SAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BEFORE A MAGISTRATE AND IF HE ALLOWED US TO GO ON WELL AND GOOD
VINEY JOSEPH AND FAMILY 101
INDEED THE INCIDENTS OF HIS STORY WERE BUT BRIEFLY WRITTEN OUT
HE HAS BEEN MISSING ABOUT A WEEK
THE LAST ONE HOWEVER HE SPOKE OF THUS
MEASURES WERE AT ONCE TAKEN TO ASCERTAIN IF SUCH A MAN AS CHARLES L
AS JACK HAD HAD BUT SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS NEW YORK OWNER HE SAYS BUT VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIM
I HAVE EARS OPEN AT ALL TIMES LISTEN AT ALL HOURS EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THEM PLEASE TO SEE FRIEND BROWN AND KNOW FROM HIM IF HE HAS HEARD ANYTHING FROM OUR FRIENDS IF HE HAVE NOT
THEY HAVE BEEN A GREAT BURDEN TO THE GOOD FOLKS HERE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME LONG ERE THIS
HAMILTON DECEMBER 23D 1856
I MADE UP MY MIND BEFORE I STARTED DO YOU THINK THAT MANY OF THE SLAVES ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR FREEDOM THE THIRD PART OF THEM AIN'T ANXIOUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BLINDED THEM TELLING ABOUT THE NORTH,--THEY CAN'T LIVE HERE
AND THUS THEY SUCCEEDED
THE VOICES OF THE OPPRESSED WHOM THOU HAST REDEEMED WELCOME THEE TO THE ETERNAL CITY LUCRETIA MOTT
HIS FATHER'S ESTATE BEING INVOLVED IN LITIGATION CAUSED HIM TO BE PUT TO THIS TRADE FARMING BEING HIS FAVORITE EMPLOYMENT AND ONE WHICH HE FOLLOWED DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE
THE VERY APPEARANCE OF THIS CONGREGATION FORBIDS IT
HOW FARED THE GIRL WHO CAME ROBED IN MALE ATTIRE
AS THE THOUGHT FLASHED UPON HIS MIND THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLD ON THE AUCTION-BLOCK HE GREW TERRIBLY DESPERATE
HER OLD MASTER WAS TOTTERING ON THE VERGE OF THE GRAVE AND HIS SON A TRADER IN NEW ORLEANS
THAT ANY ONE SHOULD EVER CLAIM HIM WAS NEVER FOR A MOMENT FEARED
SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE WE HAVE SEEN IT STATED IN THE PRINCIPIA A NEW YORK PAPER THAT WILLIAM S
SHALL I CALL IT AN EDIFICE OR AN IMPROVISED MEETING-HOUSE
FOR HE LOVED THEM WITH A BROTHER'S LOVE NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE COLORED BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE OPPRESSED AND LIKE JOHN BROWN HE LOVED THEM TO THE LAST
SAM WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND BY TRADE A BLACKSMITH
AFTER THIS SUM WAS PUNCTUALLY PAID JOHN COULD DO WHAT HE PLEASED WITH ANY SURPLUS EARNINGS
I WILL SAY IN CONCLUSION THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE FOR US IF COLUMBIA BEING A PORT OF ENTRY FOR FLYING FUGITIVES HAD BEEN ALSO THE SEAT OF GREAT CAPITALISTS AND FREEDOM-LOVING INHABITANTS
FROM SUCH A MOTIVE-POWER AS THIS CAN COME NO PARADE OF RESULTS
A BETTER SPECIMEN OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN ILL TREATED AND IN EVERY WAY UNCARED FOR COULD NOT BE EASILY FOUND
THOMAS IN A SUBSEQUENT LETTER OUR FRIEND SAYS
THIS MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HAD BEEN THE CHATTELS PERSONAL OF DANIEL COOLBY OF HARVARD MD
WILLIAM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSED A FAIR SHARE OF COMMON SENSE AND JUST ENOUGH DISTASTE TO SLAVERY TO AROUSE HIM MOST RESOLUTELY TO SEEK HIS FREEDOM
AFTER THREE HOURS HAD BEEN CONSUMED IN DEBATE UPON LEGAL POINTS HE WHO WAS SO ANXIOUSLY LOOKED FOR CAME HURRYING THROUGH THE CROWD MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE BENCH
EXTRACT REJOICES AT HEARING OF THE SUCCESS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD--INQUIRES PARTICULARLY AFTER THE FELLOW WHO CUT OFF THE PATROL'S HEAD IN MARYLAND HAMILTON AUGUST 15TH 1856
BUT PERHAPS WE HOPED TOO MUCH RELIED TOO FONDLY ON THE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS OF THE BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY PUBLIC IN SUPPOSING THAT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COULD BE FOUND PREPARED TO MAKE A SLIGHT SACRIFICE FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE AND TO KEEP THE OPPRESSED CONTINUALLY IN MIND BY A LITTLE UNTIRING PAINS-TAKING
WHERE HE CROSSED THE RIVER WAS ABOUT A HALF A MILE WIDE
MILLER MCKIM MISS MARY GREW F
THEY LEFT WIVES IN NORFOLK NAMED ALEXENIA AND ELLEN
DEAR FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--SINCE I WROTE THEE THIS MORNING INFORMING THEE OF THE SAFE ARRIVAL OF THE EIGHT FROM NORFOLK HARRY CRAIGE HAS INFORMED ME THAT HE HAS A MAN FROM DELAWARE THAT HE PROPOSES TO TAKE ALONG WHO ARRIVED SINCE NOON
THIS NOBLE AND BRAVE-HEARTED YOUNG WOMAN IS ABOUT TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE
THE ABOVE-NAMED ESCAPED FROM A DUTCHMAN BY THE NAME OF GALLIPAPPICK WHO WAS IN THE CONFECTIONERY BUSINESS
HE A ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND GOT MY MONEY
HE IS TRULY A LOVELY MAN AND HIS HEART IS FULL OF THE MILK OF HUMANITY
BUT THE FROST WAS MERCILESS AND BIT THEM SEVERELY AS THEIR FEET VERY PLAINLY SHOWED
THE COURT THEN ADJOURNED TILL NINE O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
THAT SHE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH SALE HERSELF ON THE FIRST INSULT ETC
THE CONDITION OF THE WOMEN IS NOT VERY ENVIABLE IN SOME CASES
HE WAS UNCOMMONLY STOUT WITH A HEAD INDICATIVE OF DETERMINATION OF PURPOSE JUST SUITED TO AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGER
IT LOOKED MORE LIKE THE TIME SPOKEN OF IN ISAIAH WHERE IT IS SAID AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM THAN ANY THING THAT HAD EVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY WITNESSED ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
ESPECIALLY SUPPLEMENTED AS IT IS BY AN ARTICLE FROM THE MOBILE ALABAMA REGISTER REFERRING TO ONE OF HER ADDRESSES IN THAT CITY
IT IS A DANGER WHICH THREATENS OUR OWN SOULS TO WHICH I WOULD THAT OUR EYES SHOULD BE OPEN AND ON THE WATCH
HENRY WAS ONLY TWENTY-TWO BUT HAD QUITE AN INSIGHT INTO MATTERS AND THINGS GOING ON AMONG SLAVES AND SLAVE-HOLDERS GENERALLY IN COUNTRY LIFE
INDEED IT WAS THIS THAT PUT THE IDEA OF CANADA INTO HIS MIND
I AM A LITTLE LAME YET FROM THE BEATING SUCH WAS WILLIAM'S STORY
DAY I AROSE EARLY WROTE MY PASS FOR NORFOLK LEFT MY OLD DEN WITH A MANY A GOOD BYE TURNED OUT THE BACK WAY TO 7TH ST THENCE TO MAIN DOWN MAIN BEHIND 4 NIGHT WAICH TO OLD ROCKETT'S AND AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES OF DELAY I SUCCEED IN REACHING THE STATE ROOM
DID GOD MAKE ME TO BE A SLAVE
THUS HIS AGENCY IN THIS MOVEMENT WHICH COST HIM HIS LIFE COULD READILY ENOUGH BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE STORY WERE PREPARED TO FULLY APPRECIATE HIS CHARACTER FOR PRIOR TO OFFERING HIS SERVICES IN THIS MISSION HE HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO THEM
DANIEL STANLY NAT AMBY JOHN SCOTT HANNAH PETERS HENRIETTA DOBSON ELIZABETH AMBY JOSIAH STANLY CAROLINE STANLY DANIEL STANLY JR JOHN STANLY AND MILLER STANLY ARRIVAL FROM CAMBRIDGE DANIEL IS ABOUT 35 WELL-MADE AND WIDE-AWAKE
PLEASE TO DERECT THESE BOXES FOR CARLINE GRAIVES IN THE CAR OF MRS
BACK WHERE BRUTAL MEN MAY TRAMPLE ON HER HONOR AND HER FAME
THEY REPRESENT NIGHT ESCAPES AND DAY ENCOUNTERS ON LAND AND RIVER RECEPTIONS ON THE SOIL OF FREEDOM CHARACTERS OF NOTE AMONG THE FUGITIVES AND MANY OF THOSE AMONG THE ANTI-SLAVERY PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES HAVE BECOME HISTORIC
IN THE SLAVE MARKET HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VALUED AT $800
BEFORE DOING SO HOWEVER SIMPLE JUSTICE TO ALL CONCERNED DICTATES THAT WE SHOULD HERE COPY THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST MEETING AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PHILADELPHIA VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AS IT EXISTED UNTIL THE VERY DAY THAT THE EVER TO BE REMEMBERED EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN RENDERED THE SERVICES OF THE ORGANIZATION AND ROAD NO LONGER NECESSARY
TORONTO 28TH JANUARY MONDAY EVENING 1856
HE WAS UNDER THE PATRIARCHAL PROTECTION OF A MAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM PRICE WHO CARRIED ON FARMING IN CECIL COUNTY MARYLAND
THROUGH THESE MANY YEARS OF SERVITUDE PETER WAS SOLD AND RESOLD FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER FROM ONE OWNER TO ANOTHER TILL HE REACHED THE FORTY-NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE WHEN IN A GOOD PROVIDENCE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF A FRIEND AND THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW HE REGAINED THE GOD-GIVEN BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY
HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS SALLY SHE TOO WAS A SLAVE BUT HAD NOT BEEN TREATED ROUGHLY FOR FIFTY LONG YEARS HENRY HAD BEEN IN THE GRASP OF THIS MERCILESS SYSTEM--CONSTRAINED TO TOIL FOR THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE RICH INDOLENT AND TYRANNICAL
THE DOCTOR WAS A CATHOLIC OWNING ONLY ONE OTHER AND WAS SAID TO BE A MAN OF RIGHT DISPOSITION HIS WIFE HOWEVER WAS SO MEAN THAT NOBODY COULD STAY WITH HER ISRAEL WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE TO SAVE HIS WIFE HAD LATELY BEEN MARRIED AND HER BROTHER FROM BEING SOLD SOUTH
SOON AFTER PUTTING US IN HIS BARN HIMSELF AND DAUGHTER PREPARED US A NICE BREAKFAST WHICH CHEERED OUR SPIRITS AS WE WERE HUNGRY
JAMES SAMUEL AND TOLBERT HAD BEEN OWNED BY WILLIAM HUTCHINS
HOWEVER WE WILL RAISE ALL THE MONEY THAT IS WANTING TO PAY FOR HIS SAFE DELIVERY
HE STATED THAT THE GENERAL OWNED A LARGE NUMBER OF SLAVES WHICH HE HIRED OUT PRINCIPALLY
YOUR MUCH INDEBTED OBLIGED FRIEND HARRIET EGLIN
AND NUMBERS OF THESE WERE AT DIFFERENT TIMES EMPLOYED AS LABORERS IN SOME CAPACITY
AN ACT RESPECTING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE AND PERSONS ESCAPING FROM THE SERVICES OF THEIR MASTERS THE SLAVE HUNTING TRAGEDY IN LANCASTER COUNTY IN SEPTEMBER 1851
THE NAME OF THE RECIPIENT OF THE GOOD QUAKER FRIEND'S BOUNTY AND AUNT HANNAH'S COMPANION WAS THOMAS TODD
IF POSSIBLE PLEASE KEEP A KNOWLEDGE OF HER WHEREABOUTS TO ENABLE ME TO INFORM HIM IF HE COMES
NO BODY COULDN'T WAIT UPON HER BUT ME
NEITHER HAD EVER BEEN PERMITTED TO LEARN TO READ OR WRITE BUT THEY WERE NATURALLY VERY SMART
THE INSPECTORS SO APPOINTED TO PERFORM THE SAME DUTIES AND TO BE INVESTED WITH THE SAME POWERS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS AND RECEIVE THE SAME FEES AS PILOTS ACTING AS INSPECTORS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE
BUSTILL--SLAVE SECRETED IN RICHMOND--G.S
THE UNHAPPY VICTIM BEING FAIRLY OVERCOME WAS DRAGGED LIKE A SLAIN BEAST TO A WAGON WHICH WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT WAITING TO RECEIVE HIM
THE IDEA OF WAITING YET FOR WEEKS SEEMS DREADFUL
SHINN AND FOLLOWED FARMING
TEN DAYS SINCE I RECEIVED ANOTHER LETTER FROM HIM SAYING THAT THE SHERIFF HAD BEEN THERE AND TAKEN AWAY TWO OF THE CHILDREN WHICH HE WISHED ME TO RAISE MONEY TO PURCHASE AND SET FREE AND THEN CLOSED BY SAYING THAT HIS OTHER SLAVES A MAN HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN HAD LEFT THE SAME EVENING AND HE HAD NO DOUBT I WOULD FIND THEM AT A COLORED MAN'S HOUSE HE NAMED HERE AND WISHED ME TO ASCERTAIN AT ONCE AND LET HIM KNOW
ON MONDAY I RODE SEVERAL MILES TO A MEETING
ACCORDING TO THIS ARGUMENT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE THE MASTER THE FLESH HE CLAIMS
AND THAT HIS NAME WAS SAMUEL HAWKINS
DO WRITE ME EVERY TIME YOU WRITE HOW MANY COME TO YOUR HOUSE
THE USUAL OPPORTUNITY WAS GIVEN TO TRADERS AND SPECULATORS TO THOROUGHLY EXAMINE THE PROPERTY ON THE BLOCK AND MOST SKILLFULLY WAS BURRIS EXAMINED FROM THE SOLES OF HIS FEET TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD
SIX SLAVES FOUR MEN AND TWO WOMEN FUGITIVES FROM VIRGINIA HAVING WITH THEM TWO SPRING WAGONS AND FOUR HORSES CAME TO HOOD'S MILL ON THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD NEAR THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN FREDERICK AND CARROLL COUNTIES ON CHRISTMAS DAY
SHE STATES TO HIM THAT SHE WAS READY AT ANY TIME AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT WITH HER AND SHE HOPED THAT HE WOULD LOSE NO TIME IN SENDING FOR HER FOR SHE WAS READY AND AWAITING FOR HIM
IN THIS DARK HOUR WHEN COLORED MEN'S RIGHTS WERE SO INSECURE AS A MATTER OF SELF-DEFENCE THEY FELT CALLED UPON TO ARM THEMSELVES AND RESIST ALL KIDNAPPING INTRUDERS ALTHOUGH CLOTHED WITH THE AUTHORITY OF WICKED LAW
CHEERS I HAVE REFUSED TO GO WITH THE MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL
REDOUBLING THE LABORS OF THIS NOBLE BAND AND SHAKING THE CITY FROM LETHARGY INTO FERMENT
HE WOULD BOTH FIGHT AND KILL UP THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MASTER DEVELOPED IN BEN VERY STRONG DESIRES TO GET BEYOND HIS REACH
THEY WISH TO HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS YOU CAN WRITE AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE FORWARDED LUCY ON AND IF SO WHAT ROUTE YOU SENT HER
THE PRISONER SAYS HE BELONGS TO CHARLES W
N.W
N.W
THE POSITION IN WHICH I AM PLACED THIS MORNING IS ONE VERY UNUSUAL FOR ME AND ONE THAT I FIND SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT
OR FIFTY DOLLARS IF TAKEN IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND
I SEND MY RESPECTS TO THEM BOTH AND I HOPE THAT THEY WILL REMEMBER ME IN PRAYER IF YOU MAKE A START COME TO PHILIDELPA TELL FATHER AND MOTHER THAT I AM SAFE AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL NOT MORN AFTER ME I SHALL EVER REMEMBER THEM
LIKEWISE AN INTERESTING AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY RESCUED FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE AT NORFOLK AND IN ADDITION TO THESE THE BROTHER OF J.W
BUT AT TIMES HE HAD SOME PAINFULLY DARK SEASONS TO ENCOUNTER AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE SUBJOINED LETTER
BRIGHT M.P
FROM THE LATTER PART OF OCTOBER 1855 TO THE LATTER PART OF MARCH 1856 THIS YOUNG SLAVE MOTHER WITH HER CHILD WAS SECRETED UNDER THE FLOOR OF A HOUSE
WENT FROM HAVRE DE GRACE TO ST MICHAEL'S FOR OYSTERS THENCE TO BALTIMORE AND THENCE TO HAVRE DE GRACE AGAIN
THE LIBERATOR WAS THE ORGAN OF THE EDITOR ALONE AND HE GAVE ROOM IN IT TO THE NUMEROUS REFORMS WHICH WERE IN HIS MIND ONLY SUBORDINATE TO ABOLITION
BUT WITH THE WAY OF THE WORLD IN RESPECT TO SHREWDNESS AND INTELLIGENCE HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ACTIVELY CONVERSANT
THE RESULT OF OUR MEETING PRODUCED A CALM THAT LASTED ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED ONE EVENING THAT THE CLAIMANTS OF A METHODIST PREACHER BY THE NAME OF DORSEY WERE IN THE BOROUGH AND THAT IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD ATTEMPT TO TAKE HIM THAT NIGHT
QUANTENCE PASCAL 421
SEPTEMBER 28 1856
SAM KNEW OF FRIENDS IN THE CITY AND STRAIGHTWAY USED HIS READY PEN TO MAKE KNOWN THE DISTRESS OF HIMSELF AND PARTNERS IN TRIBULATION
THAT THE OLD MAN'S HEART WAS DELIGHTED WITH WHAT HIS EYES SAW AND HIS EARS HEARD IN CANADA NONE CAN DOUBT
THE NEXT DAY AFTER JIM ARRIVED CHARLES CARTER GEORGE AND JOHN LOGAN CAME TO HAND
4 IT SHALL BE THE DUTY OF THE INSPECTOR OR OTHER PERSON AUTHORIZED TO ACT UNDER THIS LAW TO EXAMINE AND SEARCH ALL VESSELS HEREINBEFORE DESCRIBED TO SEE THAT NO SLAVE OR PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR IN THIS STATE OR PERSON CHARGED WITH THE COMMISSION OF ANY CRIME WITHIN THE STATE SHALL BE CONCEALED ON BOARD SAID VESSEL
THEY WERE RICH AND HAD BIG FARMS AND A GOOD MANY SLAVES
THESE YOUNG MEN MADE THEIR WAY OUT OF SLAVERY TOGETHER
THE FACTS WERE TOO SELF-EVIDENT
EDWARD 514
AND THUS ALMOST EVER SINCE THEIR ARRIVAL THEY HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THIS LADY'S KINDNESS AS WELL AS THE EXCELLENT EQUAL FREE SCHOOL PRIVILEGES OF BOSTON
WHETHER ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BOUND FOR CANADA OR BEFORE A UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER TRYING A FUGITIVE CASE THE SLAVE FOUND NO TRUER FRIEND THAN MR MCKIM
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT PERRYVILLE NO ONE WOULD RENDER THEM ANY ASSISTANCE AND THEY WERE COMPELLED TO LEAVE THE CORPSE IN AN OLD SAW MILL AND WALK UP TO PORT DEPOSIT A DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES IN THE NIGHT THE WEATHER BEING EXTREMELY COLD AND A DEEP SNOW ON THE GROUND
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY A VERY NOBLE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT THE ENGLISH PEOPLE MUCH UPON THIS QUESTION ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO

I CAN ONLY ANSWER BY SAYING WHEN I PARTED WITH THEM YESTERDAY FORENOON I GAVE THE WIFE OF THE PERSON IN WHOSE HOUSE THEY WERE MONEY TO PAY HER EXPENSES TO PHILADELPHIA AND BACK IN THE CARS TO PILOT THE FOUR WOMEN TO THY PLACE
THE TIME ARRIVED AND PETE BADE FAREWELL TO SLAVERY RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE NORTH STAR WITH HIS PISTOL IN HAND READY FOR ACTION

HE HIRED HIS TIME AT THE RATE OF $120 A YEAR AND HAD TO FIND HIS WIFE AND CHILD IN THE BARGAIN
ANDERSON GEO 316
WRAY MURPHYSBOROUGH HARTFORD COUNTY NORTH CAROLINA
HEAR HEAR BUT BESIDES THESE THERE WERE OF NOBLE WOMEN NOT A FEW
SOME NEEDED PRACTICAL LESSONS BEFORE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE THOROUGHNESS NECESSARY TO CLEANSING
TURNER DIFFERED WIDELY WITH HIS MASTER WITH REFERENCE TO THIS QUESTION ALTHOUGH FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS HE CHOSE NOT TO GIVE HIS OPINION TO SAID MOSEN
THERE IS A MASONIC LODGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND TWO CHURCHES AND SOCIETYS HERE AND SOME OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR BENEFIT
IS THIS A CHRISTIAN LAND AND ARE CHRISTIANS THUS FORCED TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIBERTY WILLIAM WRIGHT GUIDED THIS PARTY TO HIS HOUSE THAT NIGHT AND CONCEALED THEM IN A NEIGHBORING FOREST UNTIL IT WAS SAFE FOR THEM TO PROCEED ON THEIR WAY TO CANADA
HE HAD NOT ONLY TREATED WILLIAM BADLY BUT HE HAD THREATENED TO SELL HIM
THEY WERE REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MEN AND IT SEEMED A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE THAT I SHOULD FIND THEM IN SUCH A LARGE CITY AND DIRECT THEM TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR PURSUER WITHIN ONE HOUR AFTER I LEFT MY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN
IT WAS ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WHEN I WENT TO HIS HOUSE BUT WAS REFUSED ADMITTANCE UNTIL THOSE INSIDE ASCERTAINED WHO I WAS
AND BY HIM SHE WAS SAFELY DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
BURGLARY AND KIDNAPPING
HE WAS TROUBLED TO THINK OF HIS POOR WIFE AND CHILDREN WHOM HE HAD LEFT IN THE HANDS OF MRS HARRIET DEAN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FROM NEW MARKET
THE INFAMOUS PREJUDICE AGAINST WHICH THEY HAD BORNE TESTIMONY WAS CONTROLLING ALL THE LINES OF CITY PASSENGER RAILWAYS IN PHILADELPHIA
JOHN HAD NO SOONER REACHED CANADA THAN MARY'S HEART WAS THERE TOO
THIS CONSISTED OF TWO MARRIED COUPLES AND TWO SINGLE YOUNG MEN
IF SUCH WERE HER CALCULATIONS SHE WAS GREATLY MISTAKEN
THEY WERE WATCHED HOWEVER BY SOME PERSONS IN THAT SECTION WHO FOLLOWED THEM ARRESTED THEM AND SENT THEM TO NEW CASTLE TO JAIL
IN ITS PAGES ONE IS NOT INVITED TO HARD DRY READING
TRAVERSE BY THE WAY WAS THE FATHER-IN-LAW AND AT THE SAME TIME OWN UNCLE OF AARON'S REVEREND OWNER
HARRISON WAS JUST IN THE PRIME OF LIFE FORTY YEARS OF AGE STOUT MADE GOOD FEATURES BUT IN HEIGHT WAS RATHER BELOW MEDIUM WAS A MAN OF MORE THAN ORDINARY SHREWDNESS BY TRADE HE WAS A CHANDLER
DEAR SIR:--I NOW EMBRACE THIS FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING YOU A FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM QUITE WELL AND ARRIVED HERE SAFE AND I HOPE THAT THESE FEW LINES MAY FIND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY THE SAME
ON THE CONTRARY HE SPOKE OF HIM AS A VERY CLEVER AND NICE MAN AS MUCH SO AS ANYBODY NEED TO LIVE WITH BUT OF HIS WIFE HE COULD NOT SPEAK SO FAVORABLY
JIM CONTENTED HIMSELF UNDER HIS LOT AS WELL AS BE COULD UNTIL WITHIN A SHORT TIME OF HIS ESCAPE WHEN HE LEARNED THAT MEASURES WERE ON FOOT TO SELL HIM
IN THIS UNHAPPY CONDITION EMANUEL FOUND A CONDUCTOR OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SOME YEARS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HERE HIS WIFE DIED AND IN COURSE OF TIME HE AGAIN MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE BEING RACHEL MENDENHALL WHO DIED IN APRIL 1868 BELOVED AND REGRETTED BY ALL WHO KNEW HER
THE TEXT WAS FEED MY LAMBS AND NOW BROTHERS SISTERS CHILDREN GIVE ME YOUR HEARTS LISTEN WITH A WILL TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

IN NINE YEARS SAID MARY I HAVE NOT EVEN AS MUCH AS RECEIVED AN APRON FROM THEM HER OWNERS THE MEANNESS OF THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO LIVE HOURLY APPEARED CLEARER AND CLEARER TO HER AS SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH SYMPATHIZING SPIRITS SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE
FEW MEN HAVE BEEN MORE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO ANY RELIGIOUS SOCIETY THAN HE WAS TO THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS WHICH HE JOINED IN THE DAYS OF ITS PURITY IMPELLED BY HIS OWN RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
YET HE WAS NOT A PASSENGER SOON TO BE FORGOTTEN--HE WAS BUT A MERE BOY PROBABLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
MAY GOD BLESS AND PROTECT HIM FROM PRISON I HAVE HEARD A GREAT DEL OF OLD RICHMOND AND NORFOLK
THEY WERE TRANSFUSED THROUGH THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THEIR HUMAN SYMPATHIES ADDING TO THEIR WARMTH A FIXITY OF PURPOSE THAT BORE THEM WITHOUT A FALTER THROUGH THIRTY YEARS OF SUCH BITTER OBLOQUY AS IN THESE LATTER DAYS ONLY THE EARLY ANTI-SLAVERY DISCIPLES HAVE HAD TO ENDURE
A MAN LANDLESS IGNORANT AND POOR MAY USE THE VOTE AGAINST HIS INTERESTS
DIANA SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN
IT WAS DUE TO SUCH THAT THIS BOOK SHOULD BE WRITTEN
THORNTON
MUIR WOULD DRINK AND WAS GENERALLY DEVILISH TWO OF NAT'S SISTERS AND ONE OF HIS BROTHERS HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY TO GEORGIA BY HIM THEREFORE ADMONISHED BY THREATS AND FEARS OF HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THE SAME FIERY FURNACE NAT WAS LED TO CONSIDER THE U.G.R.R
HIS MOTHER WAS DEAD AND OF HIS FATHER'S WHEREABOUTS HE KNEW NOTHING
IT SHOULD ALSO BE FURTHER STATED IN JUSTICE TO STEPHEN'S MASTER THAT HE WAS SO DISGUSTED WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH STEPHEN'S WIFE WAS TREATED THAT HE WENT SO FAR AS TO COUNSEL STEPHEN TO ESCAPE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
IN THE DAYS OF HER PROSPERITY WHILE ALL WAS HAPPY AND CONTENTED SHE COULD ONLY BOAST OF FOUR HEAD THESE BROTHERS JACKSON ISAAC AND EDMONDSON AND ONE OTHER
HE SENDS HIS KIND REGARDS AND SINCERE THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND SUCH FRIENDS AS HAVE FAVORED HIM ON HIS WAY
HE COULD NOT THEREFORE CONSENT TO GO BACK TO HER

HE HAD HEARD OF OTHERS WHO HAD RUN AWAY AND THUS SECURED THEIR FREEDOM

THE ORIGINAL NAMES OF THESE ADVENTURERS WERE JOSEPH GRANT AND JOHN SPEAKS
CHARLES WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE A VERY DARK-COLORED INDIVIDUAL AND ALSO BELONGED TO SAID JOHNSON
TO DO WHAT WILL BE OF MOST SERVICE TO THE CAUSE--NOT THEIR CAUSE--OURS--THAT OF OUR RACE IS OUR BURNING DESIRE HELPERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AT HOME AND ABROAD--INTERESTING LETTERS
THAT SHE WOULD BARELY LIVE TO REACH NEW ORLEANS
6 IF AFTER SEARCHING THE VESSEL THE INSPECTOR SEE NO JUST CAUSE TO DETAIN HER HE SHALL GIVE TO THE CAPTAIN A CERTIFICATE TO THAT EFFECT
EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION JAMES ARMED WITH FULL AUTHORITY FROM HIS MASTER TO SELECT A CHOICE SPECIMEN STARTED FOR BALTIMORE
ONE SISTER HOWEVER WAS STILL IN SLAVERY
GAY AND CHEERFUL AS A BOY HE HAD EVER SOME PLEASANT ANECDOTE OR AMUSING TURN TO RELATE AND IN ALL PERHAPS NOT ONE WITHOUT A MORAL BEARING NOT THRUST FORWARD BUT LEFT TO BE PICKED OUT BY THE HEARER AT HIS LEISURE
THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY COLORED MEN IN THE HOUSE AND WERE DETERMINED NEVER TO BE TAKEN ALIVE AS SLAVES
BUT HERE IF YOU OPENED THE DOOR FOR LIGHT THE COLD WOULD ALSO ENTER AND SO PART OF THE TIME I SAT BY THE FIRE AND THAT AND THE CREVICES IN THE HOUSE SUPPLIED ME WITH LIGHT IN ONE ROOM AND WE HAD THE DEFICIENT WINDOW-SASH OR PERHAPS IT NEVER HAD HAD ANY LIGHTS IN IT

SUPREME COURT
ALTHOUGH A COMMON FARM HAND SAMUEL HAD COMMON SENSE AND FOR A LONG TIME PREVIOUS HAD BEEN WATCHING CLOSELY THE CONDUCT OF HIS MISTRESS AND AT THE SAME TIME HAD BEEN LAYING HIS PLANS FOR ESCAPING ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THE FIRST CHANCE
REBECCA WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF AGAIN MEETING HER HUSBAND
THE AGENT OF THE STATE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY OF MAINE TRAVELS WITH ME AND SHE IS A PLEASANT DEAR SWEET LADY
STRIPPED OF ALL HIS PROPERTY UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW FOR GIVING THEM FOOD SHELTER AND ASSISTANCE TO CONTINUE THEIR FLIGHT HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS TO BE INTIMIDATED OR DISHEARTENED BUT GAVE HIMSELF TO THE SAME BLESSED WORK AS THOUGH CONSCIOUS OF NO LOSS
SHE COULD READ WRITE AND PLAY ON THE PIANO
SO AS JAMES COULD NEITHER ENJOY HIS FREEDOM NOR EXPRESS HIS OPINION IN VIRGINIA HE DETERMINED THAT HE HAD BETTER GET A PASSAGE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND LEAVE THE LAND OF SLAVERY AND THE OBNOXIOUS SENTIMENTS OF HIS MASTER
IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO FORM A STRONG RESOLUTION AND TO START WITHOUT DELAY
INDEED THEY PERCEIVED THAT HE COULD READ AND WRITE A LITTLE AND THAT WHAT HE LACKED IN APTNESS OF SPEECH HE SUPPLIED AS A THINKER AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS SLOW HE WAS SURE
THE COURT TOOK A RECESS UNTIL A QUARTER TO THREE O'CLOCK
BUT I HAVE LONG SINCE DETERMINED TO SPEAK FOR THE DUMB WHAT IS IN MY HEART AND IN MY BIBLE LET MEN HEAR OR FORBEAR
THE MASTER'S PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE ACCORDING TO SAM'S CALCULATION WAS WORTH $3,000 PER ANNUM
THAT YOUR MEMORIALISTS ARE NOT AWARE THAT ANY MILITARY FORCE HAS BEEN SENT TO THE SEAT OF INSURRECTION OR THAT THE CIVIL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THE ADOPTION OF ANY MEASURES SUITED TO THE MOMENTOUS CRISIS

FATHER MOTHER AND CHILD PARTED WITH NO HOPE OF EVER SEEING EACH OTHER AGAIN IN THIS WORLD
HE WAS FOOT-SORE AND WEARY AND COULD NOT TELL HOW HE CAME OR WHO DIRECTED HIM
STEAMBOAT TRAVELING IS UNIVERSALLY CONDEMNED THOUGH MANY GO IN BOATS CONSEQUENTLY MANY GET LOST

THESE AGENTS WERE ENTERTAINED BY ABOLITIONISTS IN THE CITY AND MANY OF US HAD TWO OR THREE OF THEM IN EACH OF OUR FAMILIES FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
WITHIN SIXTY MILES OF PHILADELPHIA IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ICE OBSTRUCTION IN THE RIVER THE STEAMER HAD TO GO BACK

HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE OF MEDIUM SIZE AND OF QUITE A DARK HUE
EDWARD LEFT A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN BUT THE STRONG DESIRE TO BE FREE WHICH HAD BEEN A RULING PASSION OF HIS BEING FROM EARLY BOYHOOD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY ALTHOUGH THE TIES WERE VERY HARD TO BREAK

HE WAS NOT WITHOUT FRIENDS HOWEVER FOR EVEN NEAR BY DWELT A FEW WELL-TRIED ABOLITIONISTS
SARAH JANE IS ABOUT 25 YEARS OLD STOUT BUILT AND CHESNUT COLLER QUICK AND ACTIVE IN HER WALK
THIS RUMOR HAD A MARKED EFFECT UPON JOHN HENRY'S NERVOUS SYSTEM
THE WRITER WAS AT GREAT PAINS TO OBTAIN THESE INTERESTING DOCUMENTS DIRECTLY AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE MEMORABLE TWENTY-EIGHT
AND IF HE WERE NOT I KNOW OF NO PLACE WHERE THE CHARGE WOULD NOT BE EQUALLY SEVERE SO IN PERFECT KEEPING WITH HER CHARACTER SHE JUST QUIETLY REGARDED IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT IT SHOULD STILL CONTINUE WHERE IT WAS
IT IS ENDURABLE THE HAVING OF SUCH A BLOT AS DELAWARE IN OUR HISTORY WHEN IT HAS ONCE BEEN THE HOME OF SUCH A MAN
BENJAMIN WAS INDUCED TO STOP A FEW MONTHS IN PENNSYLVANIA DURING WHICH TIME HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN FARMING
SOON AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AND BEFORE THE CARS STARTED MILLER STEPPED OUT ON THE PLATFORM TO SMOKE AGAINST THE EXPOSTULATIONS OF HIS FRIENDS
JOHN NEEDLES AUXILIARY TO THE INFLUENCES ALREADY MENTIONED WAS A VERY EARLY RECOLLECTION OF SEEING A COLORED MAN HENRY BOUND WITH ROPES AND CARRIED OFF TO SLAVERY
ALTHOUGH HE WELL KNEW FREIGHT WAS NOT USUALLY DELIVERED ON SUNDAY YET HIS DEEP SOLICITUDE FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS FRIEND DETERMINED HIM TO DO ALL THAT LAY IN HIS POWER TO RESCUE HIM FROM HIS PERILOUS SITUATION
CONSEQUENTLY THE POOR FELLOW CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF GAINING HIS OBJECT IN CANADA THAN BY REMAINING IN VIRGINIA
BENJAMIN R
AND LIKEWISE TO MRS H.S
SO THAT IN A SHORT TIME HE WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH HIS SCHOOL SO FIRMLY IN THE RESPECT OF THIS COMMUNITY THAT FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS ALL THE ODIUM THAT HIS ACTIVITY IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE DREW UPON HIM DID NOT FOR A MOMENT ABATE THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE ACCORDED TO HIS PROFESSIONAL POWER
ALL THAT THEY HAD EVER KNOWN OF CIVILIZATION WAS WHAT THEY PERCHANCE PICKED UP IN THE ORDINARY ROUTINE OF THE FIELD
JOHN WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ORDINARY SIZE FULL BLACK AND CLEAR-HEADED
NEXT MORNING I WAS CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR GETTING OUT OF HIS WAY AND I WAS BEATEN AWFULLY THIS OUTRAGE MOVED NANCY TO A DEATH-STRUGGLE FOR HER FREEDOM AND SHE SUCCEEDED BY DRESSING HERSELF IN MALE ATTIRE
HE IS A TALL SLIM MAN WITH A SMOOTH FACE BALD HEAD LIGHT HAIR LONG AND SHARP NOSE SWEARS VERY HARD AND DRINKS
EDWARD THEREFORE HAD NO FAITH IN THESE LAMBS OF THE FLOCK AND LEFT THEM BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS REASON IN ALL THINGS
$10 EACH WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE POWDER BOY IS THERE ANY FUND FROM WHICH A PITTANCE COULD BE SPARED TO HELP THESE POOR CREATURES
HE HAD BEEN AWAY FOR SEVERAL YEARS STILL HE WAS A FUGITIVE AND DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF RENEWING HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD OR NEW FRIENDS WITH A WHITE SKIN FROM VIRGINIA
PERRY BEING A READY-WITTED ARTICLE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HARDLY FAIR THAT MR WILLIAMS SHOULD LIVE BY THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW INSTEAD OF HIS OWN
HE REPRESENTED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE BONDS OF ONE JAMES FORD OF STAFFORD COUNTY VIRGINIA AND THAT THIS FORD WAS A RIGHT TOUGH OLD FELLOW WHO OWNED ABOUT TWO DOZEN HEAD HOW DOES HE TREAT THEM HE WAS ASKED
HE LAID THE MATTER BEFORE HIS WIFE SUE WHO WAS SAID TO BE THE PROPERTY OF SUSAN FLINTHREW WIFE OF JOHN FLINTHREW OF CECIL COUNTY MARYLAND
BEING ONE OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS ISSUED BY THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY IN 1833 HE HAD ALSO THE GRATIFICATION OF ATTENDING THE LAST MEETING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY CALLED TO CELEBRATE THE DOWNFALL OF SLAVERY IN AMERICA AND THE DISSOLUTION OF AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE PURPOSE WAS EFFECTED
I KNOW HOW HE FEELS AT THIS TIME FOR I HAVE FELT THE SAME WHEN I WAS A RUNWAY
WILLIAM GAVE AS HIS REASON FOR BEING FOUND DESTITUTE AND UNDER THE NECESSITY OF ASKING AID THAT A MAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM BOYER WHO FOLLOWED FARMING HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS HARD EARNINGS AND ALSO CLAIMED HIM AS HIS PROPERTY
SO AS HE WAS IN NEED OF FRIENDS AND MATERIAL AID HE SOUGHT OUT THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND ON CLOSE EXAMINATION THEY HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE HIS STORY THROUGHOUT AND GAVE HIM THE USUAL BENEFIT

HE FOUND HIMSELF A JOYFUL PASSENGER ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BEING ENTERTAINED FREE AND RECEIVING ATTENTIONS FROM THE COMPANY ALL ALONG THE LINE THROUGH TO HER BRITISH MAJESTY'S BOUNDLESSLY FREE TERRITORY IN THE CANADAS
IN THOSE PERILOUS DUTIES HIS FAMILY HEARTILY SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM AND CHEERFULLY PERFORMED THEIR SHARE
THE EFFECT WAS ELECTRIC
A.N
MORE FORTUNATE THAN HIS CO-LABORER DANIEL GIBBONS HE LIVED TO SEE THE TRIUMPH OF THE CAUSE IN WHICH HE HAD LABORED ALL HIS LIFE
SIR:--I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF WRITING TO YOU A FEW LINES CONCERNING MY CHILDREN FOR I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO GET THEM AND I WISH YOU TO PLEASE TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME
NOT ANY MORE AT PREASENT
JACOB SHUSTER WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHOM SHE SPOKE OF AS HER TORMENTOR AND MASTER AND FROM WHOM SHE FLED
THIS SOURING OF FAITH THIS HALF-PARALYSIS OF THE HEART'S BEATING THIS BLURRING OF THE INTUITIONS THAT MAKE MANHOOD POSSIBLE WERE WHAT MY FATHER FOUND HERE IN THAT YEAR OF OUR LORD'S GRACE 1836
TAUGHT BY HER LOVE FOR OTHERS AND BY A SENSITIVENESS ALMOST PRETERNATURALLY QUICK SHE ALWAYS KNEW EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND PUT ALL THE POETRY OF A NATURE EXQUISITELY FINE INTO HER EFFORTS TO DIFFUSE AROUND HER PURITY AND PEACE AND HAPPINESS
I UNDERSTAND THIS TO HAVE BEEN THE OPINION ENTERTAINED BY CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL 1 BURR'S TRIAL 195 AND THOUGH IT DIFFERS FROM THAT EXPRESSED BY JUDGE IREDELL ON THE INDICTMENT OF FRIES 1 WHART
AFTER A TIME HE TOOK TO HIMSELF ANOTHER WIFE WITH WHOM HE LIVED SEVERAL YEARS

BUT TIME ROLLED ON UNTIL NEARLY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED AND WHILE REPOSING THEIR FATIGUED AND WEARY LIMBS IN BED JUST BEFORE DAY-BREAK HYENA-LIKE THE SLAVE-HUNTERS POUNCED UPON ALL THREE OF THEM AND SOON HAD THEM HAND-CUFFED AND HURRIED OFF TO A UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE
THE REWARD OF LONG YEARS OF ASSIDUOUS LABOR
THE PULSE OF THE FOUR MILLIONS OF SLAVES AND THEIR DESIRE FOR FREEDOM WERE BETTER FELT THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD THAN THROUGH ANY OTHER CHANNEL
SHE WAS A NATURAL SOVEREIGN IN THE SPHERE IN WHICH SHE MOVED AND IMPRESSED HER SON WITH THE QUALITIES WHICH MADE HIS ANTI-SLAVERY LIFE NOTHING BUT AN EXPRESSION OF THE RULES OF CONDUCT WHICH GOVERNED HIM IN ALL OTHER PARTICULARS
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THE RUMOR THAT HE HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE
AS A GENERAL THING COLORED PEOPLE WERE TRUE TO THE FUGITIVE SLAVE
ABOUT THE SAME TIME A YOUNG WOMAN ARRIVED CALLING HERSELF MARY CURTIS
MAY GOD REWARD YOU
AS MENTIONED IN MY LIFE OF ARTHUR TAPPAN SOME ABOLITIONISTS MYSELF AMONG THE NUMBER DOUBTED THE PROPRIETY OF ENGAGING IN SUCH MEASURES AS WERE CONTEMPLATED BY THE CONDUCTORS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD FEARING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN AIDING SLAVES TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR MASTERS
THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR VOYAGE AND LANDED AT THEIR PLACE OF DESTINATION

WE CAME TO PHILADELPHIA BY THE CARS
SUCH PRIVILEGES WITH WAGES AT SO LOW A RATE WERE THOUGHT TO BE EXTRA AND COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AND HAS EVER SINCE BEEN REMEMBERED WITH PLEASURE
TRUE SHE HAD BEEN KEPT AT WORK VERY CONSTANTLY AND HER OWNER HAD VERY FAITHFULLY RECEIVED ALL HER HIRE

PEACE TO HIS ASHES
ISRAEL
FOR IN ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION HE PUT TO HER SHE ANSWERED THAT AS MANY CREATURE COMFORTS AND RELIGIOUS PRIVILEGES AS SHE HAD BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF UNDER HER KIND MISTRESS STILL SHE WANTED TO BE FREE AND WAS BOUND TO LEAVE THAT SHE HAD BEEN TREATED VERY CRUELLY THAT HER CHILDREN HAD ALL BEEN SOLD AWAY FROM HER
IF I FIND HIM I WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU BEFORE I LEAVE IN BEHALF OF MAJOR RONEY IN WHOSE BUSINESS I AM NOW ENGAGED

SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN PROPOSED HIS GOING TO BALTIMORE
MY OBJECT IN WRITING YOU IS TO INQUIRE WHAT I CAN DO OR WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP MY WIFE TO ESCAPE FROM THE SAME BONDAGE THAT I WAS IN
JOSEPH CORNISH DORCHESTER CO MD
HE WAS DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK AS A MAN OF YELLOW COMPLEXION GOOD-LOOKING AND INTELLIGENT
INDEED HE COULD NOT ENDURE THE PRESSURE OF SLAVERY ANY LONGER
HE RECEIVED AN OFFER FOR HIS PROPERTY ACCEPTED IT PULLED UP STAKES AND AGAIN HOPEFULLY TURNED HIS FACE THITHERWARD
HANSBOROUGH A FARMER A FIRST-RATE MAN TO HIS SERVANTS SAID CHARLES
TO ESCAPE WAS THE ONLY REMEDY SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE AT ALL HAZARDS
HARRIS THOS 414
JACKSON WM 396
WHAT I WISH YOU WOULD DO IS TO BE SO KIND AS TO SEND OUR CLOTHES TO THIS PLACE IF THEY SHOULD FALL INTO YOUR HANDS
HE HAD HIS OWN CONVICTIONS ABOUT DYING AND THE FUTURE AND HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO FEAR OF DEATH HOWEVER IT MIGHT COME
AFTER PERFORMING THE CEREMONY THE RENOWNED AND FEARLESS ADVOCATE OF EQUAL RIGHTS THEODORE PARKER PRESENTED WILLIAM WITH A REVOLVER AND A DIRK-KNIFE COUNSELLING HIM TO USE THEM MANFULLY IN DEFENCE OF HIS WIFE AND HIMSELF IF EVER AN ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE BY HIS OWNERS OR ANYBODY ELSE TO RE-ENSLAVE THEM
FOR THE BEST PART OF SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE WAR SHE HAS TRAVELED VERY EXTENSIVELY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES GOING ON THE PLANTATIONS AND AMONGST THE LOWLY AS WELL AS TO THE CITIES AND TOWNS ADDRESSING SCHOOLS CHURCHES MEETINGS IN COURT HOUSES LEGISLATIVE HALLS C AND SOMETIMES UNDER THE MOST TRYING AND HAZARDOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
ROBERT WAS ONLY NINETEEN WITH AN INTELLIGENT FACE AND PREPOSSESSING MANNERS
HE WAS CALLED UPON HOWEVER TO SETTLE CERTAIN MINOR MATTERS BEFORE HE COULD SEE HIS WAY CLEAR TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF CANADA
UPON THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER HE SETTLED UPON THE FARM ON WHICH HE DIED
I HAVE TO REGRET THAT I AM COMPELLED TO REFER SO OFTEN TO MY OWN EXERTIONS
YOU WERE LED OUT BY ONE OF THESE MOBS AND SAVED FROM THEIR VIOLENCE AND THE IMMINENT PERIL OF DEATH ALMOST BY A MIRACLE
MY WIFE GAVE THEM ALL A GOOD SUPPLY OF CLOTHING BEFORE THEY LEFT US
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS FURNISHED TO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE IN A PRUDENTIAL MANNER A BRIEF SKETCH OF THESE VERY PASSENGERS INCLUDING THE ADVERTISEMENTS BUT NOT THE LETTER
THESE PASSENGERS ALTHOUGH INTERESTING AND MANIFESTING A STRONG DESIRE TO BE FREE HAD NO REMARKABLE TALES OF PERSONAL SUFFERING TO RELATE
CONSERVATISM IT WAS CALLED
CONGRESS HAS BEEN AGITATING THE ST DOMINGO QUESTION
A COPY OF IT WAS PRESERVED WITH OTHER UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD DOCUMENTS
NEVERTHELESS THE VIOLENCE OF THE MASTER DID NOT ABATE UNTIL HE HAD BEATEN PETE OVER THE HEAD AND BODY TILL HE WAS WEARY INFLICTING SEVERE INJURIES
I HAVE A DAUGHTER OF FIFTEEN AS FAR ADVANCED AS MISS RAWLINGS
THEY IMPARTED TO THE COMMITTEE MUCH INFORMATION RESPECTING THEIR SEVERAL SITUATIONS TOGETHER WITH THE CHARACTERS OF THEIR MASTERS IN RELATION TO DOMESTIC MATTERS AND THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES UNDER WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SEVERALLY HELD TO SERVICE--ALL OF WHICH WAS LISTENED TO WITH DEEP INTEREST
THEIR DELICACY HELD ITSELF ABOVE COMMON VITUPERATION
ARE WE NOT NEAR IN SPIRIT
I KNOW THAT I SPEAK WITHIN BOUNDS WHEN I SAY THAT DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY FROM 1847 TO 1860 I HAVE CONTRIBUTED FROM MY EARNINGS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND FOR THE FIVE YEARS DURING THE WAR A LIKE AMOUNT TO PUT DOWN THE REBELLION
MONEY C AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM DIRECT
BESIDES THESE WE KNOW OF A FEW SAY THREE OR FOUR ABLE AND SMART BUT UTTERLY DESTITUTE AND KEPT SO PURPOSELY BY THEIR OPPRESSORS
I THOUGHT HE COULD PERHAPS DELIVER TWO LECTURES TWO NIGHTS IN SUCCESSION
HAVING FOUND A CORRESPONDENCE SO QUICK AND EASY AND WITHAL SO VERY FLATTERING I ADDRESS YOU AGAIN MORE FULLY

CHEERS THEN THERE WAS WENDELL PHILLIPS ADMITTED TO BE BY ALL WHO KNOW HIM PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL ORATOR WHO SPEAKS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
THE EXCITEMENT RELATIVE TO THE HEROIC JOHN BROWN NOW IN HIS GRAVE HAS AFFECTED THE WHOLE NORTH OR AT LEAST EVERY ONE WHO HAS A HEART IN HIS BREAST PARTICULARLY THIS PORTION OF THE STATE WHICH IS SO DECIDEDLY ANTI-SLAVERY
THE PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND
FULLY BENT ON LEAVING THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WAS FIXED BY HIM ON WHICH TO COMMENCE HIS JOURNEY
AMONG THE MOST EXCITING CASES TENDING TO JUSTIFY THIS COURSE THE FOLLOWING MAY BE NAMED
HE HAD A WIFE ELIZA FOR WHOM HE FELT THE GREATEST AFFECTION
BUT THAT COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS DOES NOT CONSIST IN INCREASING THE PRIVILEGES OF ONE CLASS AND CURTAILING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER BUT IN GETTING EVERY CITIZEN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE PROGRESS AND DURABILITY OF THE STATE
THIS LEAVES ME WELL AND HOPE IT MAY FIND YOU AND FAMILY THE SAME
SOME OF MY MEETINGS PAY ME POORLY
HEINES PETER 316
WHY COULDN'T YOU SOLD ME TO SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS I SAID
WE WOULD SECURE TO EVERY MAN WHAT THE CONSTITUTION SECURES THE RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY WE WOULD DO WHAT WE CAN FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE COLORED RACE AND RESTORE TO THEM THAT INESTIMABLE RIGHT OF WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SO MEANLY AS WELL AS UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE
AS SOON AS THE WAY OPENED FOR HER SHE FOLLOWED HIM
TURNING FROM THE THREE MALE COMPANIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINDING A BRIEF SPACE FOR MARIA IT WILL BE WELL TO STATE HERE THAT FEMALES IN ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE FROM A LIFE OF BONDAGE UNDERTOOK THREE TIMES THE RISK OF FAILURE THAT MALES WERE LIABLE TO NOT TO MENTION THE ADDITIONAL TRIALS AND STRUGGLES THEY HAD TO CONTEND WITH
WOMEN'S GARMENTS HUNG ALL AROUND
SHOT BY SLAVE-HUNTERS IN SETTING OUT FOR FREEDOM WESLEY WAS THE LEADER OF THIS PARTY

COTTON HENRY 532
I WAS OWNED BY HIGH HOLSER A HIDE SORTER A MAN SAID TO BE RICH A GOOD CATHOLIC THOUGH VERY DISAGREEABLE
AS JAMES RECOUNTED HIS GRIEVANCES WHILE UNDER THE RULE HE BY NO MEANS GAVE HER A VERY FLATTERING CHARACTER BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE PLAINLY STATED THAT SHE WAS A DESPERATE WOMAN"--THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY GOOD OF HER AND THAT HE WAS MOVED TO ESCAPE TO GET RID OF HER
WITH THIS MASTER SAID EVAN I HAVE KNOWN HARD TIMES
SHE WENT BY THE NAME OF FANNY COATES
THOUGH THE FOUR WHO WERE SUCCESSFUL SAW NO SEVERE FIGHT IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS A FIGHT NEVERTHELESS
BUT I AM NOT DONE ABOUT YOUR REPUBLICANISM
THIS IS A COMMON CAUSE
STILL PHILADELPHIA MADE NO PLEA FOR GOD'S LOVE IN HIS HUMANITY
AFTER THIS ACT HER MASTER TOOK A DRINK OF BRANDY AND DROVE OFF

HIS NAME IS DR H.B
THESE PASSENGERS WERE MOST LIKELY-LOOKING ARTICLES A NUMBER OF THEM DOUBTLESS WOULD HAVE COMMANDED THE VERY HIGHEST PRICES IN THE RICHMOND MARKET
MRS MOTT HAS ALSO BEEN EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN AID OF THE WORKING CLASSES AND HAS LABORED EFFECTIVELY FOR A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM WHICH MAKES THE RICH RICHER AND THE POOR POORER IN THE WOMAN'S RIGHTS QUESTION SHE WAS EARLY INTERESTED AND WITH MRS ELIZABETH CADY STANTON SHE ORGANIZED IN 1848 A WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION AT SENECA FALLS NEW YORK
MY LIFE WITH MY UNCLE AND AUNT MADE ME AN ABOLITIONIST
BUT HAVING ONCE RENDERED THE SERVICE THEY CANNOT AND OUGHT NOT RETURN TO SLAVERY
THE MOB BROUGHT ALL HIS FURNITURE OUT AND PILING IT UP IN THE STREET SET IT ON FIRE
KNOWING NO WRITTEN CHARACTER BUT THE FIGURE 5 HE KEPT THIS ACCOUNT BY MEANS OF A CURIOUS SYSTEM OF HIEROGLYPHICS IN WHICH STRAIGHT MARKS MEANT HORSE SHOES PUT ON CIRCLES CART-WHEELS FIXED ETC
WHEN I PARTAKE OF THE SYMPATHY WHICH RUNS FROM HEART TO HEART AT THIS MOMENT IN WELCOME TO OUR GUEST OF TO-DAY I CANNOT BUT CONTRAST HIS PRESENT POSITION WITH THAT WHICH NOT SO FAR BACK BUT THAT MANY OF US CAN REMEMBER HE OCCUPIED IN HIS OWN COUNTRY
HAVING THUS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING POSSESSION OF AND SECRETING THIS FLEEING CHILD OF FIFTEEN AS BEST THEY COULD IN WASHINGTON ALL CONCERNED WERE COMPELLED TO POSSESS THEIR SOULS IN PATIENCE UNTIL THE STORM HAD PASSED
MR MCKIM WAS AN EARLY ADVOCATE OF COLORED ENLISTMENTS AS A MEANS OF LIFTING UP THE BLACKS AND PUTTING DOWN THE REBELLION
THIS PLACE WAS NEAR THE RANGE DIRECTLY OVER THE BOILER AND OF COURSE WAS VERY WARM
HOW FOR FORTY YEARS AND MORE HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO SERVE UNDER THE YOKE TOTALLY DESTITUTE AS TO ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PARENTS WHEREABOUTS
HOW PROVOKING

THE SITUATIONS OF JEREMIAH AND JULIA SMITH HOWEVER WERE NOT CONSIDERED VERY HARD INDEED THEY HAD FARED RATHER BETTER THAN MOST SLAVES IN VIRGINIA NEVERTHELESS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THEY DESIRED TO BETTER THEIR CONDITION TO KEEP OFF OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK AT LEAST
HE HAD TWO SONS ROBERT AND ALBERT BOTH DISSIPATED WOULD LAYABOUT THE TIPPLING TAVERNS AND KEEP LOW COMPANY SO MUCH SO THAT THEY WERE NOT CALCULATED TO DO ANY BUSINESS FOR THEIR FATHER WILLIAM HAD TO BE A KIND OF A RIGHT HAND MAN TO HIS MASTER
THE AUCTIONEER BEGAN AND SOON HAD A BID OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
ONE HUNDRED LASHES WOULD ONLY BE A COMMON FLOGGING THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES WAS THOUGHT NOTHING OF
I DON'T LIKE BUYING THEM OR GIVING MONEY TO SLAVE-HOLDERS EITHER
ASSUREDLY THIS IS TREATMENT WITH WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN FAMILIAR

HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN USED TOLERABLE WELL NOT SO BAD AS MANY HAD BEEN USED
IN ORDER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THEY WERE STRONGLY ARMED
EIGHT DAYS SHOULD BE ESTIMATED FOR A LETTER TO ARRIVE FROM PHILADELPHIA
AND THE READING OF GARRISON'S THOUGHTS ON COLONIZATION AT ONCE MADE HIM AN ABOLITIONIST
FOR ONE WEEK HE SEEMED TO BE IMPROVING
UNDER THE SEVEREST INFLICTION OF PUNISHMENT SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COMPLAIN
AMY IS VERY GOOD IN HELPING AND IS COLLECTING CLOTHING WHICH SHE THINKS CANNOT BE SENT TILL NEXT WEEK

YOURS RESPECTFULLY MARY D
I RAN AND STAYED AWAY FOUR DAYS WHICH MADE MR HENRY VERY ANXIOUS
YOUNG GIRLS AS PROMISING AS HERSELF SHE WELL KNEW HAD TO BE EXPOSED EXAMINED AND SOLD TO THE VILEST SLAVE-HOLDERS LIVING
MY DEAR FRIEND:--THIS MORNING OUR FAMILY WAS AROUSED BY THE SCREAMS OF A YOUNG COLORED GIRL WHO HAS BEEN LIVING WITH US NEARLY A YEAR PAST
HE WENT ON TO SWEAR THAT HE FIRST SAW HER IN A CAB IN THE CITY
ROBERTA PROFESSED TO BE A CHRISTIAN AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE BETHEL METHODIST CHURCH
YET JOSEPH WAS NOT SATISFIED DEPRIVED OF HIS FREEDOM
HIS MISTRESS DIED
AS FOR SHOES I NEVER KNOWED WHAT IT WAS TO HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES UNTIL I WAS GROWN UP
PLEASE TELL HER TO REMEMBER MY LOVE TO HER MOTHER AND HER COUSIN EMELIN AND HER HUSBAND AND THOMAS HUNTER
RUTH WAS RATHER A NICE-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN TALL AND POLITE IN HER MANNERS
THE BOROUGH OF COLUMBIA SITUATED ON ITS EASTERN BANK IN THE COUNTY OF LANCASTER WAS THE GREAT DEPOT WHERE THE FUGITIVES FROM VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND FIRST LANDED
MARY FRANCES WAS ABOUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE OF MIXED BLOOD REFINED IN HER MANNERS AND SOMEWHAT CULTIVATED
DEAR FRIENDS--MCKIM AND STILL:--I WRITE TO INFORM YOU THAT ON THE 16TH OF THIS MONTH WE PASSED ON FOUR ABLE BODIED MEN TO PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY WERE FOLLOWED LAST NIGHT BY A WOMAN AND HER SIX CHILDREN FROM THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF AGE UP TO SIXTEEN YEARS I BELIEVE THE WHOLE BELONGED TO THE SAME ESTATE AND THEY WERE TO HAVE BEEN SOLD AT PUBLIC SALE I WAS INFORMED YESTERDAY BUT PREFERRED SEEKING THEIR OWN MASTER
AND ENTERING UPON THE STUDY OF MEDICINE ATTENDED ONE OR MORE COURSES OF LECTURES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
HE BELIEVED EVEN IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF FREEDOM IN OUR LAND IN THE ULTIMATE EXTINCTION OF SLAVERY AND AT TIMES ALTHOUGH ADVANCED IN YEARS THOUGHT HE WOULD LIVE TO WITNESS THAT GLORIOUS CONSUMMATION
IF YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO PETERSBURG YOU WILL PLEASE TO WRITE AS SOON AS CAN I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO WRITE AT PRESENT BUT YOURS RESPECTFULLY EMMA BROWN OLD NAME MARY EPPS NOW JOSEPH AND ROBERT MARY'S ASSOCIATE PASSENGERS FROM RICHMOND MUST HERE BE NOTICED
SHE KNEW FULL WELL THAT IT WAS NO FAINT-HEARTED STRUGGLE THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HER SO SHE HAD NERVED HERSELF WITH THE OLD MARTYR SPIRIT TO RISK HER ALL ON HER FAITH IN GOD AND FREEDOM AND WAS READY TO TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES IF SHE FELL BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
SHE WAS OWNED BY JANE COOPER WHO LIVED NEAR LAUREL IN SUSSEX COUNTY
BEING UNCOMMONLY SHREWD HE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT A CAPTAIN OF A SCHOONER FROM BOSTON AND DETERMINED TO APPROACH HIM WITH REGARD TO SECURING A PASSAGE
BUT IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED SINCE THAT THE REMOVAL CANNOT BE SO SAFELY EFFECTED WITHOUT TAKING TWO LARGER PACKAGES WITH IT
IT IS NOT AT ALL TO THE CREDIT OF HIS FELLOW-MEMBERS THAT IT MUST BE SAID OF THEM THAT WHEN HE WAS BEARING THE CROSS AND DOING THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS NOW SO UNIVERSALLY HONORED THEY MANY OF THEM WERE NOT ONLY NOT IN SYMPATHY WITH HIM BUT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY IF THEY HAD HAD THE REQUISITE VITALITY AND COURAGE HAVE CUT HIM OFF FROM THEIR DENOMINATIONAL FELLOWSHIP
HIS WHOLE PHYSIQUE WAS A SPLENDID SAMPLE OF NATURE'S HANDIWORK
BUT THE HUMAN RACE IS STRUGGLING UP TO A HIGHER COMPREHENSION OF ITS OWN DESTINY AND OF THE MYSTERIOUS PURPOSES OF GOD SO FAR AS THEY ARE REVEALED TO OUR FINITE INTELLIGENCE
JOINER MARIA 259
THE YOUNGER ESPECIALLY
BUT SUDDENLY HIS MODE OF TREATMENT CHANGED
THOMPSON WM
ACTON GAVE ME THREE DOLLARS FOR THEM
GOULDEN ALFRED 135
WM AND ELLEN 368
44 SEC
THE NAME OF HIS MASTER WAS REV
HE WAS TAKEN FROM HIS TEAM IN LANCASTER AND LODGED IN BALTIMORE JAIL
PINKET JOHN 500
HETTY SCOTT ALIAS MARGARET DUNCANS AND DAUGHTER PRISCILLA
HE CAME FROM ALEXANDRIA VA
ALL THE WAY FROM THE WHARF THE COLD RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS AND THEY GOT COMPLETELY DRENCHED BUT THEIR HEARTS WERE SWELLING WITH JOY AND GLADNESS UNUTTERABLE
10 AN INSPECTOR PERMITTING A SLAVE TO ESCAPE FOR THE WANT OF PROPER EXERTION OR BY NEGLECT IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTY SHALL BE FINED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
I SEE THERE IS A LAW PASSED IN MARYLAND NOT TO SET ANY SLAVES FREE
SOMETIMES IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP--AT OTHER TIMES AS A WHEELWRIGHT--AGAIN AT MAKING BRUSHES AND BROOMS AND AT LEISURE TIMES HE WOULD TRY HIS HAND IN ALL THESE CRAFTS
MOVED ALMOST TO DESPERATION AT THEIR MASTER'S COURSE IN THUS SELLING THEM THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER REFLECTION DETERMINED TO SAVE THEMSELVES IF POSSIBLE AND WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE OF THE JOURNEY THEY TURNED THEIR EYES TOWARDS THE NORTH STAR AND UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT THEY STARTED FOR PENNSYLVANIA NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY WOULD EVER SEE THE GOODLY LAND OF FREEDOM
HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ON UNUSUALLY INTIMATE TERMS WITH HIM
WE CALL THEM WITH US MIXED BLOOD
A LARGE FIRE IS BURNING OUT OF DOORS AND HERE ARE ONE OR TWO BOYS WITH HATS ON
$50 IF TAKEN IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR COUNTIES OF MONTGOMERY AND PRINCE GEORGE'S OR $100 IF TAKEN ELSEWHERE AND SECURED SO THAT I GET HIM
IN THE MEANWHILE MR MCKIM WAS PREPARING WITH GREAT DISPATCH THE SUBJOINED DOCUMENT FOR THE ENLIGHTENMENT AND WARNING OF ALL
INSTEAD OF BEING BLACK SHE WAS OF A DARK-BROWN COLOR OF HER BONDAGE SHE MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT
AS IN THE CASE OF A GREAT NUMBER AMONG THE OPPRESSED OF THE SOUTH WHEN SIMPLY LOOKING AT MARIA NO VISIBLE MARKS OF ILL USAGE IN ANY WAY WERE DISCERNIBLE
IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE CONFLICT WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE DOOR WHEN SHE SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM SO THAT WHEN SHE AND HER FRIENDS WENT OUT AND FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE MOST INTENSE SUSPENSE PERVADED THE COURT-ROOM
FORNEY AND OTHER GENTLEMEN IN RECOMMENDING TO THE PUBLIC MR STILL'S WORK ENTITLED THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD THE THRILLING NARRATIVES CANNOT BE READ EVEN AT THIS DAY WITHOUT EXCITING THE DEEPEST EMOTION
REMEMBER ME TO THOM
I ALSO GAVE HER A LETTER TO THEE
YOU HOLD UP BEFORE ME THE GLORIOUS PROMISES CONTAINED IN THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
HE WAS OWNED IN MARYLAND BY MRS MARY GIBSON WHO RESIDED AT ST MICHAEL'S ON THE EASTERN SHORE
P ANOTHER PORTION WAS BROUGHT BY CAPT
IN BEING PULLED OUT HIS RESISTANCE WAS SUCH THAT SEVERAL WINDOW LIGHTS WERE BROKEN IN THE CAR
MOORE HENRY 97
LEAVING NO ROOM WHATEVER FOR HIM TO PROVIDE FOR HIS WIFE
HOW THEY ESCAPED WAS UNKNOWN
IN 1864 I WENT TO BALTIMORE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY IMPRISONMENT
CHARLES HENRY GROSS BEGAN LIFE IN MARYLAND AND WAS MADE TO BEAR THE HEAT AND BURDEN OF THE DAY IN BALTIMORE UNDER HENRY SLAUGHTER PROPRIETOR OF THE ARIEL STEAMER
ABRAM AND RICHARD WERE INTIMATE FRIENDS AND LIVED NEAR EACH OTHER
HER HEART WAS HONEST AND SHE DID HER BEST
OH FRIEND BENEATH THE MOST DELICATE PREPARATIONS OF THE CANE CAN YOU NOT SEE THE STINGING LASH AND CLOTTED WHIP
IT ALSO EXPANDED HIS IDEA TOUCHING TRAVELING THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD ETC
BUT THEY CROSSED SAFELY
MCLANE WAS ONCE SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT JACKSON THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO ENGLAND ON A MISSION FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT HE HAD SERVED TWO TERMS IN CONGRESS SOME OF THE SERVANTS ABE SAID WERE TREATED PRETTY WELL BUT SOME OTHERS COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING IN THE MASTER'S FAVOR UPON THE WHOLE HOWEVER IT WAS MANIFEST THAT THE MCLANE SLAVES HAD NOT BEEN AMONG THE NUMBER WHO HAD SEEN SEVERE HARDSHIPS
CONSEQUENTLY THEY INVESTED SIX DOLLARS IN A LITTLE BOAT AND AT ONCE PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR THIS MOST FEARFUL ADVENTURE
IT IS AN ANTI-SLAVERY INSTITUTION AND WHOLLY UNDER ANTI-SLAVERY CONTROL AND INFLUENCE
ROBERT RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD MAKE ONE LESS IN A SHORT WHILE
THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION IN ALL ITS PROVISIONS IS AT THE VERY BASIS OF OUR EXISTENCE AS A NATION
THE UNPLEASANTNESS WHICH GREW OUT OF THE MISCHIEF DONE BY THE OX ON GEORGE MATTHEWS FARM TOOK PLACE THE FIRST OF OCTOBER 1855
UPON ONE OCCASION HIS SON RECEIVED A KICK FROM A HORSE WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO MOUNT AT THE DOOR
BUT SHOULD I FALL I TRUST DEAR LADY THAT MY DEAR WIFE AND FAMILY MAY BE REMEMBERED BY THE GOOD AND TRUE NEWPORT MAY 25TH 1860
SOME OF THEM ARE PRO-SLAVERY POLITICIANS
THE OFFICERS CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE NO SLAVES ON THAT BOAT THAT NOBODY COULD LIVE THERE ETC ETC ASKED FOR THEIR CHARGES $3 AND DISCHARGED THE CAPTAIN
THIS MAN WAS IN ILL HEALTH AND AFTER A TIME HE AND HIS WIFE STARTED NORTHWARD BRINGING RACHE WITH THEM
IN 1836 WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER A YOUNG WOMAN THERE CAME TO HER HOME ONE OF THE POOREST MOST IGNORANT AND FILTHIEST OF MANKIND--A SLAVE FROM THE GREAT VALLEY OF VIRGINIA
BRADLEY RICHARD 305
IF YOU HAVE HERD OR SEAN THEM PLES LET ME NO
IT IS THE DEVIL'S GOVERNMENT AND GOD WILL DESTROY IT
BROWN AND THEIR FRIENDS RESOLVED THAT THEY SHOULD BE EXHIBITED UNDER THE WORLD'S HUGE GLASS CASE IN ORDER THAT THE WORLD MIGHT FORM ITS OPINION OF THE ALLEGED MENTAL INFERIORITY OF THE AFRICAN RACE AND THEIR FITNESS OR UNFITNESS FOR FREEDOM
RANDOLPH PHYSICALLY WAS A SUPERIOR MAN
IN OTHER WORDS THAT SHE HAD DERIVED HER FULL SHARE OF ADVANTAGES FROM THE PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION THE APPEARANCE OF JUST SUCH PERSONS IN SOUTHERN CITIES HAD OFTEN LED NORTHERNERS WHEN TRAVELING IN THOSE PARTS TO REGARD THE LOT OF SLAVES AS QUITE COMFORTABLE
ARMSTEAD 122
DEAR SIR:--IT IS WITH EXTREME PLEASURE THAT I SET DOWN TO INCLOSE YOU A FEW LINES TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM WELL I HOPE WHEN THESE FEW LINES COME TO HAND THEY MAY FIND YOU YOUR FAMILY IN GOOD HEALTH AND PROSPERITY I LEFT YOUR HOUSE NOV
IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE CHARGES ABE DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT HIS MASTER MEDDLED TOO MUCH WITH THE BOTTLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH HE WAS OFTEN IN A TOP-HEAVY STATE
I AM ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOD OF THE OPPRESSED NOT TO MAN
THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE ESCAPE OF EACH PARTY BEING SO UNUSUAL THERE WAS SCARCELY GROUND FOR ANY OTHER CONCLUSION THAN THAT DISASTER WAS IMMINENT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AVERTED
BUT BACK THIS MOTHER WAS RESOLVED NEVER TO STAY
WHILE THE COMMITTEE WAS LOOKED TO FOR AID IN THE DELIVERANCE OF THIS POOR FELLOW IT WAS PAINFUL TO FEEL THAT IT WAS NOT IN THEIR POWER TO ANSWER HIS PRAYERS--NOT UNTIL AFTER HIS ESCAPE WAS IT POSSIBLE SO TO DO
SUCH LUCK ON THE ROAD WAS INDEED A MATTER OF WONDER AND DELIGHT TO PASSENGERS GENERALLY
JONES WAS WELL CARED FOR BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND SENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING FEELING THAT RESOLUTION UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND LIBERTY WERE INVALUABLE
TUDLE HENRY AND WIFE 525
NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN LOST FROM STORMON'S TO CANADA
YOU SON OF A B----H I WILL GIVE YOU POUTING AROUND ME
MILLER 654-659
BUT ANTHONY FOUND HIMSELF SOLD FOR THIRTY DOLLARS AS NOTHING WAS DONE FOR HIM
OFTEN HAD HE BEEN VISITED WITH SEVERE STRIPES AND HAD BORNE HIS FULL SHARE OF SUFFERING FROM HIS MASTER
HOW AMID THE MOST APPALLING DISCOURAGEMENTS PROMPTED ALONE BY HIS UNDYING DETERMINATION TO BE FREE AND BE REUNITED WITH THOSE FROM WHOM HE HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY HE CONTRIVED TO BUY HIMSELF
SMITH A SHOE DEALER TO WM
IN HER COMBINE IN HAPPY UNION THE CALM STRENGTH OF SOUL AND SELF-RELIANCE OF HER YOUNGER WITH THE POETIC IDEALITY AND A JUST DEGREE OF THE QUICK SENSIBILITY OF HER ELDER SISTER WITH BETTER HEALTH THAN EITHER MAKING HER FOREMOST OF THE THREE IN THAT EXECUTIVE EFFICIENCY WHICH DID SO MUCH TO GIVE THEIR PLANS THE UNIFORM SUCCESS ALREADY MENTIONED
I SHALL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF FORWARDING THE ABOVE
MR MCKIM WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED
THE FOLLOWING LETTERS ARE FAIR SAMPLES OF A LARGE NUMBER WHICH CAME TO THE COMMITTEE TOUCHING THE MATTER OF CLOTHING ETC
HIS MECHANICAL IMPLEMENT TO MEET THE DEATH-STRUGGLE FOR FRESH AIR ALL TOLD WAS ONE LARGE GIMLET
I THINK HOWEVER IF I HAD BEEN WRITING SUCH A BOOK I WOULD HAVE WEDGED IN MUCH MORE TESTIMONY AGAINST SLAVERY AND ITS HORRID ACCOMPANIMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES
FOR YEARS ONE HALF AT LEAST OF MY FRIEND'S TIME HERE HAS BEEN GRATUITOUSLY GIVEN TO CASES OF DISTRESS AMONG THIS CLASS
A MAN CALLING HIMSELF ALFRED HOMER ANSWERING TO THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION CAME TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN JUNE 1856
BUT THAT HE WAS ACCUSED OF RUNNING AWAY WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WERE SLAVES
HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS WERE SAID TO BE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH BAPTIST CHURCH AND BOTH HAD BORNE GOOD CHARACTERS UNTIL WITHIN A YEAR OR SO PREVIOUS TO ALFRED'S DEPARTURE
THIS MADE IT THE MORE ODIOUS
IT WAS ONLY BY THE MOST INDOMITABLE RESOLUTION AND PERSEVERANCE THAT FREELAND THREW OFF THE YOKE
COMPLAINT THEREFORE WOULD SIMPLY AMOUNT TO NOTHING
HIS TESTIMONY FULLY CORROBORATED THAT OF HIS COMRADE LEWIS PECK
SAID OFFICER WAS OF THE MAYOR'S POLICE FORCE
AND AS THE ORGANIZATION JUST NAMED WAS PROBABLY THE MOST PERFECT AND EFFICIENT OF ITS KIND AND SERVED AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO THE BRANCHES IN OTHER STATES ITS RECORD DOUBTLESS COVERS THE LARGER PART OF THE FIELD OF OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD
WISHING TO PRODUCE A SKETCH WORTHY OF THIS VETERAN WE ADDRESSED HIM ON THE SUBJECT BUT FAILED TO OBTAIN ALL THE DESIRED MATERIAL
MR HENRY WOULD MAKE THEM LIE DOWN ACROSS A LOG STRIPPED NAKED AND WITH EVERY STROKE WOULD LAY THE FLESH OPEN
YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE SHAMEFUL OUTRAGE OF A COLORED MAN OR BOY NAMED WAGNER WHO WAS KIDNAPPED IN OHIO AND CARRIED ACROSS THE RIVER AND SOLD FOR A SLAVE
THEY HAD DETERMINED NOT TO STOP SHORT OF CANADA
$300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON SATURDAY THE 30TH OF AUGUST 1856 MY SERVANT WOMAN NAMED EMELINE CHAPMAN ABOUT 25 YEARS OF AGE
HENRY CAME FROM NEAR NORFOLK VA
WHORRA FOR JUDGE KANE I FEEL SO INDIGNANT AT THE MAN THAT IT IS NOT EASY TO WRITE THE FOREGOING SENTENCE AND YET WHO IS HELPING OUR CAUSE LIKE KANE AND DOUGLAS NOT FORGETTING STRINGFELLOW
MANFULLY DID HE WRESTLE WITH DIFFICULTY AFTER DIFFICULTY UNTIL HE FINALLY HAPPILY TRIUMPHED AND REACHED PHILADELPHIA IN A GOOD CONDITION--THAT IS HE WAS NOT SICK BUT HE WAS WITHOUT MONEY--HOME--EDUCATION OR FRIENDS EXCEPT AS HE FOUND THEM AMONG STRANGERS
HE HAD LIVING WITH HIM AT ONE TIME TWO COLORED MEN THOMAS COLBERT AND JOHN STEWART
I WAS NOT AT HER WEDDING
IF SHE HAD BEEN ALONE HIS RECOGNITION WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO AVAIL
MOSES ARRIVES WITH SIX PASSENGERS
MY MASTER BELONGED TO CHURCH AND SO DID I
IN BALTIMORE SHE BELONGED TO A WEALTHY AND FASHIONABLE FAMILY AND HAD BEEN A SEAMSTRESS AND LADIES SERVANT GENERALLY
THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DISCHARGE OF THE WOMAN WAS QUICKLY SPREAD TO THOSE WITHOUT WHO RAISED SHOUTS OF JOY
JOHNSON HAS UNDERTOOK TO HAVE THEM WELL WASHED AND CLEANED DURING THE DAY
HIS OLD MASTER VALUED GEORGE'S SERVICES VERY HIGHLY AND HAD OFTEN DECLARED TO OTHERS AS WELL AS TO GEORGE HIMSELF THAT WITHOUT HIM HE SHOULD HARDLY KNOW HOW TO MANAGE
THIS TOUCHING EPISTLE WAS GIVEN BY THE DISOBEDIENT WILLIAM TO A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANT COMMITTEE WHEN ON A VISIT TO CANADA IN 1855 AND IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE OF TOO MUCH VALUE TO BE LOST
NOR WAS HE SO MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS KIND-HEARTED MASTER JOHN EDWARD JACKSON OF ANNE ARUNDEL MD OR HIS OLD FIDDLE THAT HE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY WHILE IN BONDAGE
HE GAVE NOTHING TO HIS SERVANTS
HIS MASTER WAS OF THE SAME PERSUASION
THREATS AND FEARS WERE SO HORRIFYING TO THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT STAND IT
JACKSON MARY ANN 512
IN GOING OVER THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED HE ADDED THAT NOT ONLY WAS HIS MASTER A HARD MAN BUT THAT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PARTOOK OF THE SAME EVIL SPIRIT
THE STORY WHICH ADAM RELATED CONCERNING HIS MASTER AND HIS REASONS FOR ESCAPING RAN THUS
HOW MUCH IT MEANT IS SEEN IN THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS ADDED BY UNANIMOUS ACCEPTANCE
CLARK PETER BY BENJAMIN JOHNSON HALL
THIS WAS NOT A SLAVE STATE
HIS BEARING IS SUBDUED AND MODEST
SIXTY PASSENGERS CAME IN ONE MONTH--TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL--GREAT PANIC AND INDIGNATION MEETING--INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MASTERS AND FUGITIVES
SIXTY PASSENGERS CAME IN ONE MONTH--TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL--GREAT PANIC AND INDIGNATION MEETING--INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MASTERS AND FUGITIVES
FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME I HAD BEEN OVERSEER
I PRESUME THE REPORT IS TRUE AND HOPE HE WILL FINALLY ESCAPE THOUGH I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THEY WERE IN PURSUIT OF HIM
HE WAS OF THE RARE TYPE OF CHARACTER REPRESENTED BY FRANCIS JACKSON AND JAMES MOTT
JOSEPH WAS ALSO ONE OF THE CHATTELS BELONGING TO THE MISSES PORTLOCK
DIVERSITIES OF GIFTS BUT THE SAME SPIRIT ELIZABETH ALTHOUGH FOR MANY YEARS SHUT OUT BY FEEBLE HEALTH FROM ANY PART REQUIRING MUCH BODILY EXERTION WAS EVER A WISE COUNSELLOR AS WELL AS READY WITH SUCH HELP AS HER STATE OF HEALTH WOULD WARRANT
HIS UNDYING SPIRIT HAUNTS THEM BY DAY AND BY NIGHT AND IN THE MIDST OF THEIR VOLUPTUOUS ENJOYMENTS THE VERY THOUGHT OF JOHN BROWN CHILLS THEIR SOULS AND POISONS THEIR PLEASURES
AFTER BEING DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE WHERE HE WAS IN MORE PRIVATE QUARTERS HE GAVE FULL VENT TO THE JOY HE EXPERIENCED ON REACHING THIS CITY
I WILL SET HIM IN SAFETY FROM HIM THAT PUFFETH AT FROM THEM THAT WOULD ENSLAVE HIM WHEN ON MONDAY MORNING I LEARNED THAT THE FUGITIVES HAD PASSED THROUGH THE PLACE ON SABBATH AND CONCKLIN IN CHAINS PROBABLY AT THE VERY TIME I WAS SPEAKING ON THE SUBJECT REFERRED TO MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME
JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF HARVEST OF THE YEAR 1851 FOUR MEN CAME OFF FROM WASHINGTON COUNTY MARYLAND
THERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE IT WAS SUPPOSED AS IT HAD THEN BEEN ABOUT A GENERATION SINCE A FUGITIVE HAD BEEN TAKEN BACK FROM THE OLD BAY STATE AND THROUGH THE INCESSANT LABORS OF WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON THE GREAT PIONEER AND HIS FAITHFUL COADJUTORS IT WAS CONCEDED THAT ANOTHER FUGITIVE SLAVE CASE COULD NEVER BE TOLERATED ON THE FREE SOIL OF MASSACHUSETTS
I WILL NOT SAY THAT HE WAS LANGUISHING IN PRISON FOR THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE
AS SOON AS HE SAW THEM HE RAN AND JUMPED OUT OF THE OVERSHOOT SOME TEN FEET DOWN
SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH A CHAMPION OF ANY PARTICULAR CAUSE AS OF ALL REFORMS
BROWN HARRIET ALIAS JANE WOOTON 136
PLEASE SEND WORD BY JOHNSON WHETHER OR NO THOSE SEVEN ARRIVED SAFE I WROTE THEE OF TEN DAYS SINCE
HE DID NOT LIVE WITH HER HOWEVER BUT WAS HIRED OUT IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND
MARTIN HAD HELD UP THE VISION OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK BEFORE SAM
JENNY BUCHANAN
HE WAS OWNED BY THE WIDOW CLAYTON AND WAS WHITE ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN NEARLY RELATED TO HER BEING A MULATTO
BUT IT WAS BORNE WITH A CHEERFUL CONSTANCY
THE COLONEL COULD SAY BUT LITTLE SO COMPLETE WAS HIS AMAZEMENT
THE FUGITIVES WERE HOPEFUL BUT OF THE DIFFICULTIES AHEAD THEY WOT NOT
DUNAGAN SARAH A 313
I CAN ONLY SHOW A LIFE UNFOLDING AND BY THE ESSENTIAL LAWS OF ITS GROWTH EMBRACING THE NOBLEST CAUSE OF ITS TIME
PETER GROSS SAYS THAT HE TOO WAS OWNED BY JOSEPH GRIFFISS
I TOLD HIM I WOULD NOT STAND IT OLD UNCLE GEORGE WASHINGTON NEVER FAILED TO GET A WHIPPING EVERY DAY SO AFTER SERVING AT THIS ONLY A FEW DAYS JOHN MADE HIS LAST SOLEMN VOW TO BE FREE OR DIE
CAN NOTHING BE DONE FOR SUCH CASES
WORD REACHED ADAM HOWEVER BARELY IN TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE THROUGH THE AID OF FRIENDS
DEAR FRIENDS--FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MY DEAR HUSBAND AND I HAVE WISHED VERY GRATEFULLY TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING SO KINDLY ASSISTED US IN VARIOUS ANTI-SLAVERY EFFORTS AND WE NOW THINK IT QUITE TIME TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF OUR STEWARDSHIP AND ALSO TO LAY BEFORE YOU SEVERAL ITEMS OF INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES
MY WIFE HAS KEPT HOUSE FOR A COLORED GENTLEMAN AND GOT HER BOARD FOR HER SERVICES SAID EVAN
TO THEM AND HIS WIFE HE WAS DEVOTED
ALL THE FREIGHT ON DECK CONSISTING OF TOBACCO AND COTTON HAD TO BE THROWN OVERBOARD TO SAVE THE PASSENGERS
MR MCKIM TO GEO
HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN CARRYING POWDER IN HIS BOAT FROM A POWDER MAGAZINE AND FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED THE POWDER BOY SECOND LETTER FROM LAWYER BIGELOW
THE PRUDENCE SKILL AND WATCHFUL CARE WITH WHICH THE BUSINESS WAS CONDUCTED ARE WELL ATTESTED BY THE FACT THAT SO FAR AS CAN BE REMEMBERED DURING ALL THE MANY YEARS OF THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD NOT A PLAN MISCARRIED AND NOT A SLAVE THAT REACHED THEIR STATION WAS RETAKEN
THUS SAFELY THROUGH THE KIND OFFICES AND AID OF THE FRIENDS AT QUAKERTOWN THEY WERE DULY FORWARDED ON TO THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
IN ANSWER TO AN ADVISORY LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMITTEE THE FOLLOWING FROM THE DOCTOR IS EXPLICIT RELATIVE TO HIS WISHES AND FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO THEIR BEING SENT ON TO NEW YORK
HERE HIS NECESSARY WANTS WERE MET AND DIRECTIONS GIVEN HIM HOW TO REACH THE LAND OF REFUGE WHERE HE WOULD BE OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL SLAVE-HOLDERS AND SLAVE-TRADERS
THEY WERE LIVING IN EATONTOWN NORTH CAROLINA
AS SOON AS MY BREAKFAST IS OVER I WILL SEE HILLIS AND DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE IN THEIR CASE
FOR MANY YEARS HE SERVED AS INSPECTOR OF PRISONS IN PHILADELPHIA AND THUS BY LONG AND CONSTANT PRACTICAL OBSERVATION WAS ACCUMULATED THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN HEART IN ITS DARKEST WINDINGS THAT OFTEN ASTONISHED THE OBJECTS OF HIS CARE WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE CUNNINGLY TO BLIND HIS EYES TO THEIR REAL CHARACTER AND INTENTIONS
WILLIAM WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK HUE AND OF A COURAGEOUS BEARING
YOURS C
THIS WAS NOT AMONG THE LEAST OFFENCES WITH WHICH PETE CHARGED HIS MASTER
IT WAS BY THIS MEANS WILLIAM PROCURED CLOTHING AND CERTAIN OTHER NECESSARIES
SMITH MESSRS
WE HEARD FROM HIM FROM PORTLAND BUT ARE ANXIOUSLY LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LETTER
HE WAS TOLERABLE GOOD SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES BAD SOME OF THE SLAVES SUPPOSED THEMSELVES TO BE ON THE EVE OF BEING EMANCIPATED ABOUT THE TIME GEORGE LEFT
COOPER WM 108
BUT THE SHOT BEING LIGHT NONE OF THE FUGITIVES WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED
THE CASE OF THE CHILD ALLUDED TO ABOVE IS A CASE IN POINT
STILL ESQ PHILADELPHIA PA
I THINK IT IS NOW SOME FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS SINCE THAT SOME PACKAGES LEFT THIS VICINITY SAID TO BE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY IN NUMBER AND AS I SUPPOSE WENT THROUGH YOUR HANDS
ALL THAT WAS NEEDED HOWEVER TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE WAS THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRESSED ELEGANTLY IN A FASHIONABLE SUIT OF MALE ATTIRE AND HAVE HER HAIR CUT IN THE STYLE USUALLY WORN BY YOUNG PLANTERS
THE TRIAL IN THE BOX LASTED JUST SEVENTEEN HOURS BEFORE VICTORY WAS ACHIEVED
BUT REMEMBER THAT SLAVERY IS THE MERE CREATURE OF LOCAL OR STATUTE LAW AND CANNOT EXIST OUT OF THE REGION WHERE SUCH LAW HAS FORCE
NO MORE AT PRESENT FROM A FRIEND THOMAS F
SATISFIED THAT IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER TO PERIL HIS LIFE FOR FREEDOM IN THIS WAY THAN TO REMAIN UNDER THE GALLING YOKE OF SLAVERY HE ENTERED HIS BOX WHICH WAS SAFELY NAILED UP AND HOOPED WITH FIVE HICKORY HOOPS AND WAS THEN ADDRESSED BY HIS NEXT FRIEND JAMES A
I AM BADLY SITUATED LIVING WITH MRS PALMER AND HAVING TO PUT UP WITH EVERYTHING--YOUR MOTHER IS ALSO DISSATISFIED--I AM MISERABLY POOR DO NOT GET A CENT OF YOUR HIRE OR JAMES BESIDES LOSING YOU BOTH BUT IF YOU CAN RECONCILE SO DO
MIND THE SLAVE SHE HAD ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THE LAST FEW YEARS AND CONTINUED ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN WORKS OF BENEVOLENCE
BUT AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THE LAW WAS NOT CARRIED INTO EFFECT IN THIS INSTANCE SO THAT THE SMELL OF SMOKE WAS NOT UPON THEM THE EFFECT OF THE TURPENTINE HOWEVER OF THE NATURE OF WHICH THEY WERE TOTALLY IGNORANT WAS WORSE IF POSSIBLE THAN THE SMOKE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ABOVE ALL IF ACTION MEANS A WEALTH OF GOODNESS OVERLIVING ALL SCORNS COMPELLING RESPECT FROM A COMMUNITY REBUKED FELLOWSHIP FROM A CHURCH CHARGED WITH UNGODLINESS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF UNSTAINED REPUTE FROM A PUBLIC EAGER TO BLACKEN WITH SCANDAL
THAT THEY ALWAYS DID CATCH EVERY ONE WHO RAN OFF BUT NEVER BROUGHT THEM HOME BUT SOLD THEM RIGHT OFF WHERE THEY COULD NEVER RUN AWAY ANY MORE OR GET TO SEE THEIR RELATIVES AGAIN
NO MORE AT PRESENT FROM YOUR FRIEND GEORGE BALLARD
HIS INTEREST IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE BEGAN IN HIS CHILDHOOD INSPIRED BY SUCH BOOKS AS SANDFORD AND MERTON AND DR TONEY'S PORTRAITURE OF SLAVERY WHICH HIS FATHER PUT INTO HIS HANDS
BENJAMIN ROSS ALIAS JAMES STEWART
OH MY GOD WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM OR SHALL I DO FOR THEM
BUTLER JAMES AND STEPHEN 70
SAM ISAAC PERRY CHARLES AND GREEN
DANIEL PAYNE RICHMOND VIRGINIA
HE HAD WITNESSED A GREAT DEAL OF THE HARDSHIPS OF THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY AND HE HAD QUITE ENOUGH INTELLIGENCE TO PORTRAY THE HORRORS THEREOF IN VERY VIVID COLORS
I LEFT THEM IN THE WINTER OF 1824 AND CAME TO SALEM OHIO WHERE I KEPT A SMALL STATION ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD UNTIL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TOOK MY WORK AWAY
JAMES HENSON ALIAS DAVID CALDWELL
JAMES HENSON ALIAS DAVID CALDWELL
WHY SHOULD NOT THE EXPATRIATED BLACKS GO TO FREE COUNTRIES AND GROW PRODUCE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR EVERYBODY WHO REQUIRES IT
EVERY FUGITIVE REGREATED TO HEAR OF THE DEATH OF MRS MOORE
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS A MAN OF THOUGHT AND POSSESSED IN A LARGE MEASURE THOSE HUMANE TRAITS OF CHARACTER WHICH LEAD MEN TO SYMPATHIZE WITH SUFFERING HUMANITY WHEREVER MET WITH
DEATH TO THE TRAITORS AND CONFISCATION OF THEIR SLAVES IS NO CHILD'S PLAY
YOURS TRUELY J.H
THIS BUSINESS DAVID PROTESTED AGAINST IN SECRET BUT WHEN ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD HIS PROTESTATIONS WERE OVER AND ABOVE BOARD OF THE DOCTOR DAVID SAID THAT HE WAS CLEVER BUT A CATHOLIC HE ALSO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT HIS WIFE WAS TOLERABLE CLEVER ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN PLACED UNDER HER WHERE HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING HER BAD TRAITS IF SHE HAD ANY
ALFRED IS OF POWERFUL MUSCULAR APPEARANCE AND NATURALLY OF A GOOD INTELLECT
TOM ADMITTED THAT HE WAS TREATED VERY WELL BY MR HATTEN AND HIS FAMILY EXCEPT THAT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT PERRYVILLE THE TRAIN HAD GONE WITH THE KIDNAPPER AND THE GIRL
WILLIAM OR AS HE WAS ALWAYS CALLED LLOYD WAS THE YOUNGEST BUT ONE OF FIVE CHILDREN AND HAD NOT DONE WITH HIS SCHOOLING BEFORE HE BEGAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OWN SUPPORT
CHARLES AND JOHN WERE OWNED BY JAMES HODGES AND ROBERT BY WM
THIS INCREASE OF THIRTEEN IN THE FAMILY WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSING BUT AFTER BREAKFAST THEY ALL RETIRED TO THE BARN TO SLEEP ON THE HAY EXCEPT THE WOMAN AND FOUR CHILDREN WHO REMAINED IN THE HOUSE
RICHARD GREEN AND HIS BROTHER GEORGE
THEY GAVE NOT ONLY MATERIAL BUT LIKEWISE WHOLE-SOULED AID AND SYMPATHY IN TIMES OF NEED TO A DEGREE WELL WORTHY OF COMMEMORATION WHILE THE NAME OF SLAVE IS REMEMBERED
THEY DRAGGED THE CARRIAGE PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE COUNSEL FOR THE RESPONDENT CHEERING THEM BY HUZZAS OF THE WILDEST KIND AND THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE AND ITS CONTENTS TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE WOMAN GERMANTOWN ROAD NEAR FIFTH STREET BEGUILING THE WAY WITH SONGS AND SHOUTS
AFTER FIGHTING THEIR WAY OUT OF THE JAIL THEY SEPARATED FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS THE HUSBAND OF LAVINA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONFLICT AT THE JAIL PASSED ON TO CANADA LEAVING HIS WIFE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF FRIENDS
JOHNSON HENRY 70
THE COMMITTEE SYMPATHIZED DEEPLY WITH HIM BUT COULD DO NO MORE
FEW OF DR FURNESS'S HEARERS WILL FORGET HIS SERMON OF DECEMBER 16 1860 SO FULL WAS IT OF PROPHETIC WARNING AND SADDENED BY THE THOUGHT OF THE FATE WHICH MIGHT BE IN STORE FOR HIM AND HIS CONGREGATION
BOOKS AGAINST THE MISTRESS
IN EITHER CASE TO BE LODGED IN CAMBRIDGE JAIL
STILL--_SIR_--I NOW TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING YOU A FEW LINS HOPING TO FIND YOURSELF AND FAMLY WELL AS THES LINES LEVES ME AT PRESENT MYSELF AND BROTHER ANTHONY ALBERT BROWN'S RESPECTS
MAXWELL THOS 499
IT STATED THAT A LADY FROM MARYLAND WAS THEN IN PHILADELPHIA STOPPING AT A BOARDING-HOUSE ON ARCH STREET AND THAT SHE WAS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ALBERTI WITH A VIEW OF OBTAINING HIS SERVICES TO HELP CATCH AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD SOJOURNER WHOM SHE CLAIMED AS HER PROPERTY
IS THIS MR TAPPAN ON REPLYING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE HE SAID
SHE WAS FOLLOWING HER HUSBAND WHO ESCAPED ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE HER
DEPOT
DEPOT
IN PROOF OF THIS BOLD ASSERTION THE TWO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE NAMES STAND AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER ARE PRESENTED
JOSEPH HENRY HILL
HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK
BUT SUBSEQUENT COUNTS PROVED HIM TO BE AMONG THE DEFEATED BY ONLY A VERY SLIGHT MAJORITY
SHE WILL FIND FOSTER AT LADLUM'S WAREHOUSE ON THE BASIN AND WHEN YOU WRITE CALL MY NAME TO HIM AND HE WILL TRUST IT
BAILEY JOSIAH 272
FRANK CAMPBELL
HERE HE STAYED ONE WEEK AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH TIME THE NEED OF FRESH AIR WAS SO IMPERATIVE THAT HE RESOLVED TO GO OUT AT NIGHT TO ALLEN'S COTTAGE AND SPEND A DAY IN THE WOODS
IT WAS FURTHER AGREED THAT IT SHOULD BE THE DUTY OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE TO KEEP A RECORD OF ALL THEIR DOINGS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE MONEY RECEIVED AND EXPENDED ON BEHALF OF EVERY CASE CLAIMING THEIR INTERPOSITION
BUT OF THIS THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY
A SIX-BARRELLED REVOLVER HEAVILY LOADED WAS DROPPED IN THE SCUFFLE AND LEFT
WILLIAM HENRY WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS OF AGE AND BELONGED TO DOCTOR B
WITH HIM THEY VENTURED TO CONVERSE AND SOON FELT THAT HE MIGHT BE TRUSTED WITH AT LEAST A HINT OF THEIR CONDITION
SO UP ON THE MOW CAME THREE OF THE MEN WHEN TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE AS THEY PRETENDED WE WERE DISCOVERED
THE CHILD WHO UP TO THIS TIME HAD BEEN QUIET RAISED A PITEOUS CRY AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
SAMUEL SLATER ALIAS PATTERSON SMITH CAME FROM A PLACE CALLED POWER BRIDGE MD
JOHN WESLEY WAS THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF A LIVELY TURN PLEASANT COUNTENANCE DARK COLOR AND ORDINARY SIZE
IN REPLY I REMARKED
IN A SHORT TIME SAMUEL CAME OUT AND TOLD ME THAT HARDCASTLE HAD AGREED THAT IF HE HAWKINS WOULD GIVE UP HIS TWO OLDER BOYS WHO BELONGED TO CHARLES WESLEY GLANDING
HE REMAINED IN THAT PRISON NEARLY TWO MONTHS
EYE KNOCKED OUT
BUT WHILE HE REMAINS WITHIN OUR BORDERS HE IS TO REMEMBER THAT SUCCESSFULLY TO INSTIGATE TREASON IS TO COMMIT IT
IF ALL THIS CAN BE DONE SOME LITTLE TIME OR NOTICE MUST BE HAD TO GET THEM ALL READY
COULD TELL ME NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT HIM
ALTHOUGH HE WAS ONLY TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE HE HAD FULLY WEIGHED THE MATTER OF HIS FREEDOM AND APPEARED FIRMLY SET AGAINST SLAVERY
EVER SINCE THAT MISFORTUNE HE HAD FREQUENTLY TALKED OF PUTTING THE REST IN HIS POCKET THIS DISTRESSING THREAT MADE THE REST LOVE HIM NONE THE MORE
HIS FAITH REMAINED STRONG NEVERTHELESS AND HE SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE COMMITTEE
ON THE SAME DAY HUGHES AND KNIGHT WERE ARRESTED ON THE CHARGE OF SLANDER AGAINST WILLIAM CRAFT
UTTERLY INSENSIBLE TO THE MOST PIERCING APPEALS THAT MAN CAN MAKE TO MAN SHE LOVED HER HARDNESS CLUNG TO IT
THE GRAVE WAS MY ROBBER
BEFORE EMANCIPATION AND WHILE THE BANE OF SLAVERY WAS ON THE COUNTRY THE THRILLING FACTS OF THIS VOLUME COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC
WHAT HE ARDENTLY DESIRED AND INCESSANTLY LABORED FOR WAS THE REIGN OF UNIVERSAL FREEDOM PEACE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
I WROTE MR FITZGERALD'S ADDRESS ON THE ENCLOSED PAPER
WOOD HOUSE NEAR NEWCASTLE MAY 3 1860
ITS LAST FOUL OFFSPRING THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
WE WOULD EMPLOY EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS TO ERADICATE IT FROM OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FOR THE HIGHEST WELFARE OF OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY
SIMPLY GIVE HIM A BED QUILT AND HE WILL FARE WELL ENOUGH IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM SAID THE DR THE PROPOSAL WAS READILY ACCEDED TO AND CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY THE ACCOMMODATING HOST
I WILL GIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THEM IF SECURED IN JAIL SO THAT I CAN GET THEM
MILTON HAWKINS ANSWERED ABRAM
JOHN WAS ABOUT TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES HIGH DARK COLOR AND WELL-GROWN FOR HIS YEARS
I ALWAYS HESITATED WHICH TO HONOR MOST THE FUGITIVE SLAVE OR THE CITIZEN WHO HELPED HIM IN DEFIANCE OF UNJUST LAWS
HENRY HOOPER
NIAGARA--THE GREAT THE GLORIOUS NIAGARA--MAY HUSH YOUR SPIRIT WITH ITS CEASELESS THUNDER
DO YOU KNOW ANY PROMISING YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD ACCEPT MY SCHOLARSHIP
AFTER ARRIVING IN CANADA HIS HEART TURNED WITH DEEP INTEREST AND AFFECTION TO THOSE LEFT IN THE PRISON-HOUSE AS THE FOLLOWING LETTER INDICATES
HIS SERVICES HAD BEEN REQUIRED IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP AND ON THE FARM UNDER CHARLES PRESTON WHO CLAIMED TO OWN HIM
I HAVE TOLD THEM TO REMAIN IN THE CARS AT GREEN STREET UNTIL SOMEBODY MEETS THEM
LETTER FROM JOHN THOMPSON
IT IS THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BARBARISM AND CIVILIZATION BETWEEN LIBERTY AND THE MOST HORRIBLE DESPOTISM THAT EVER CURSED THIS EARTH IN WHICH WE ARE CALLED TO TAKE PART
ARTHUR WOULD OFTEN LOOK AT THE HEIRS AND THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEIR COMING INTO POSSESSION WOULD MAKE HIM TREMBLE
THESE FACTS TENDED TO INCREASE SAM'S DESIRE TO GET AWAY BEFORE HIS TIME WAS OUT
FREMONT FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HE REPRESENTED THAT HIS DISTINGUISHED MASTER DIED LEAVING THIRTEEN HEAD OF SLAVES
GILEPON TOLD HIM WHAT MY OBJECT WAS HE ENCOURAGED ME TO GO ON SAYING THAT HE WOULD DO ALL HE COULD FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF MY OBJECT
TO SEE YOU WITH A BOOK IN YOUR HAND THEY WOULD ALMOST CUT YOUR THROAT ANN HAD ONE CHILD ONLY A SON TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WHO CAME IN COMPANY WITH HIS PARENTS
WITH WONDERFUL SWIFTNESS AND ADROITNESS SHE ELUDED PURSUIT AND WAS SOON HURRIED AWAY
BUT ABOVE ALL THESE AND BEYOND ALL THESE WE HAVE WITH US THE HIGHEST ATTRIBUTES OF GOD JUSTICE AND MERCY
OUTWARDLY THEY WERE GOOD CHRISTIANS
PRIOR TO HIS COMING INTO THE HANDS OF MOORE HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED ANY VERY HARD USAGE AT LEAST NOTHING MORE SEVERE THAN FELL TO THE COMMON LOT OF SLAVE-BOYS THEREFORE THE PERIOD OF HIS EARLY YOUTH WAS DEEMED OF TOO LITTLE INTEREST TO RECORD IN DETAIL
IN 1842 A PARTY OF SIXTEEN SLAVES CAME TO YORK PA FROM BALTIMORE COUNTY MD
DID HE ARRIVE SAFELY
THE HORSE AND WAGON PASSED ON AND SHE ROLLED INTO THE BUSHES AND WAITED FOR DELIVERANCE FROM HER BONDS
ABOUT THE YEAR 1853 MARYLAND HER NATIVE STATE HAD ENACTED A LAW FORBIDDING FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM THE NORTH FROM COMING INTO THE STATE ON PAIN OF BEING IMPRISONED AND SOLD INTO SLAVERY
TAKE THE AXES AND GO TO WORK WAS THE NEXT ORDER
AND COUNTRY MERCHANTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NORTH AS WELL AS SOUTH DID NOT DARE TO HAVE IT KNOWN THAT THEY BOUGHT GOODS OF THEM
THE GOOD WOMAN COMPREHENDING THE SITUATION AT A GLANCE TOLD HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE GET WARM AND WAIT TILL HER HUSBAND CAME HOME
HE MUST HAVE HIS RIGHT ARM PLACED CAREFULLY IN A SLING
HE SAID THEY EXPECTED TO GO AWAY TO-MORROW
DR NOTTINGHAN AND DR HARRIS OF THAT INSTITUTION BOTH STATED THAT HIS WAS THE WORST CASE OF THE KIND THEY EVER HAD
IN ADDITION TO THIS UNPLEASANT PROSPECT VIRGINIA HAD JUST ABOUT THAT TIME PASSED A LAW PROHIBITING SLAVES FROM HIRING THEIR TIME"--ALSO A NUMBER OF NEW POLICE RULES WITH REFERENCE TO SLAVES AND FREE COLORED PEOPLE ALL OF WHICH THE HUMANE SLAVE-HOLDERS OF THAT LIBERAL STATE REGARDED AS HIGHLY ESSENTIAL BOTH FOR THE PROTECTION AND SAFETY OF MASTER AND SLAVE BUT THE STUPID-HEADED MOSES WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS
GOOD IN HAVING PASSED FIVE OF GOD'S POOR SAFELY TO JERSEY AND CHESTER COUNTY LAST WEEK
ALSO WITH REGARD TO HIS FREEDOM HE WAS QUITE SOLICITOUS
TICE AND A CARRIAGE FROM F.J
ROBERT PURVIS WAS BORN IN CHARLESTON S.C
HIS SWEET TEMPER HIS MODESTY HIS UNFAILING CHEERFULNESS HIS RARELY MISTAKEN JUDGMENT OF MEN AND MEASURES
YOU WILL PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
NELSON--JOHN THOMPSON--WM
FOR INSTANCE HE HAD A WIFE ON HIS MIND TO DISPOSE OF IN SOME WAY BUT HOW HE COULD NOT TELL
ON ARRIVING AT NEWCASTLE THE CAPTAIN HAD HIM PLACED IN JAIL FOR THE PURPOSE AS WE ARE INFORMED OF TAKING HIM BACK TO SAVANNAH
WOULD BRING $1,400 PERHAPS
SO WHEN THEY COME TO YOU THEN YOU WILL SEND THEM TO JESSE TUEHART EDWARD ST NO 43
BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE BRIDGE THE CONDUCTOR SAID
HE WORE A SMALL GOATEE IS PLEASANT WHEN SPOKEN TO AND VERY POLITE
NOR WAS SHE OVERLY FASTIDIOUS ABOUT THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF COLORED BLOOD VISIBLE IN JOHN'S COMPLEXION
EXTRAORDINARY FINE LIKELY BUT FOR THE FACT OF ELOPEMENT I WOULD NOT TAKE 8000 DOLLARS FOR THEM BUT AS THE THING NOW STANDS YOU CAN SAY TO PETER HIS NEW DISCOVERED RELATIONS IN PHILADELPHIA I WILL TAKE 5000 FOR THE 4 CULERD PEOPLE IF THIS WILL SUITE HIM HE CAN RAISE THE MONEY I WILL DELEVER TO HIM OR HIS AGENT AT PADUCA AT MOUTH OF TENNESSEE RIVER SAID NEGROES BUT THE MONEY MUST BE DEPOSETED IN THE HANDS OF SOME RESPECTABL PERSON AT PADUCA BEFORE I REMOVE THE PROPERTY IT WOLD NOT BE SAFE FOR PETER TO COME TO THIS COUNTERY WRITE ME A LINE ON RECPT OF THIS LET ME KNOW PETERS VIEWS ON THE ABOVE I AM YOURS C B
DURING HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE WHILE REJOICING OVER HIS TRIUMPHANT FLIGHT HE GAVE WITH NO APPEARANCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT CALMLY AND IN A COMMON-SENSE LIKE MANNER A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER WHICH WAS ENTERED ON THE RECORD BOOK SUBSTANTIALLY AS FOLLOWS
16TH 1851
JAIL
MANFULLY DID THE BLACK MEN STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND DECLARE THAT THEY DID NOT MEAN TO GIVE UP THEIR BOAT ALIVE
IN A MOMENT WE CONCLUDED THAT WE COULD PULL THEM UP THE EMBANKMENT FROM THE DECK BY TAKING HOLD OF THEIR HANDS AS THEY STOOD ON TIP TOE
ANTHONY LONEY ALIAS WILLIAM ARMSTEAD
THE SUBJOINED PASS WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STATION IN PHILADELPHIA BY CHARLES AND WHILE IT WAS INTERESTING AS THROWING LIGHT UPON HIS ESCAPE IT IS IMPORTANT ALSO AS A SPECIMEN OF THE WAY THE PASS SYSTEM WAS CARRIED ON IN THE DARK DAYS OF SLAVERY IN VIRGINIA
AS SHE BROUGHT NOTHING AWAY WITH HER IT WAS NECESSARY THE NEXT DAY TO PROCURE A COMPLETE WARDROBE FOR A GIRL WHICH WAS CAREFULLY PACKED FOR HER TO TAKE WITH HER
THIS FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED FROM VIRGINIA
GIVING TO THE COLORED PEOPLE WAS A PERFECT PASSION WITH HER
CHEERS SIR THIS COUNTRY IS FROM TIME TO TIME HONORED BY THE PRESENCE OF MANY DISTINGUISHED AND OF A FEW ILLUSTRIOUS MEN
HE WAS IN HIS TWENTY-THIRD YEAR A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE COPPER-COLORED AND OF A PREPOSSESSING COUNTENANCE
NOW I RATE NO MAN BY HIS SIZE COLOR OR POSITION BUT I APPEAL TO YOU IN LOOKING AT THE TESTIMONY THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED HERE ON THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE QUESTION AND JUDGING IT BY ITS INTRINSIC WORTH WHETHER THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WITNESSES ON THE PART OF THE PLAINTIFF AND THOSE OF THE DEFENDANT EITHER IN INTELLIGENCE MEMORY LANGUAGE THOUGHT OR ANYTHING ELSE
HE SUPPOSED AS THE WIND WAS BLOWING SO HARD THOSE ON SHORE WHO HAILED HIM MUST HAVE CONCLUDED THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THEM AND THAT HE MEANT NO DISRESPECT IN TREATING THEM WITH SEEMING INDIFFERENCE
THIS IS DOUBTLESS A RUSE TO ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF THE PHILADELPHIA POLICE IN THE INTERESTING GAME OF NIGGER HUNTING
LOUISA WAS A MULATTO GIRL SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS IN THE ROOM ONE WAS MAHALA RICHARDSON WHOM HE KNEW A YOUNG GIRL AND THE PRISONER
FROM HORACE GREELEY
THE WHITES LIKE OLD APOLLYON IN THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AT THIS DECIDED INDICATION THAT THEIR PRECIOUS LIVES MIGHT NOT BE SPARED IF THEY DID NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AN IMMEDIATE RETREAT SUDDENLY PARTED FROM THEIR ANTAGONISTS
I AM GOING PRESENTLY TO TAKE HIM HOME WITH ME AT THIS JUNCTURE HE SEIZED THE LITTLE FELLOW AT THE SAME TIME CALLING OUT DINAH PUT HIS CLOTHES ON BY THIS TIME THE FATHER TOO HAD SEIZED HOLD OF THE CHILD
THE COLORED MAN WHO HAS THEM IN CHARGE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE HUSBAND OF ONE OF THEM TO BRING HIS WIFE UP
I TOLD HER THE KITCHEN WAS KEPT AS CLEAN AS ANY KITCHEN IN THE PLACE
THE RIGHT TO TRAMPLE ON THE WEAK IN OPPRESSION WAS INDISPUTABLE
HE DON'T LIKE TO SEE THEM HOLD UP THEIR HEADS ABOVE THEIR SHOULDERS DIDN'T HE PREACH
HILL'S LETTER
I AM NOW AT UNION SPRINGS WHERE I SHALL PROBABLY ROOM WITH THREE WOMEN
THE REST THEY BROUGHT AWAY
DR PENNINGTON A HIGHLY RESPECTED COLORED PREACHER OF THIS CITY
MILLER WHO RESIDED IN WEST NOTTINGHAM TOWNSHIP CHESTER COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA IN THE LATTER PART OF 1851 AND THE BEGINNING OF 1852
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A LARGE REWARD OFFERED FOR JOE'S APPREHENSION I FEARED THERE MIGHT BE SOME LURKING SPY READY TO POUNCE UPON US
WILSON AND ONE OTHER WHO SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED ON HAVING BEEN DETAINED ON ACCOUNT OF SICKNESS
HE BELIEVED IN PLAINNESS OF APPAREL AS TAUGHT BY FRIENDS NOT AS A FORM OR A RULE OF SOCIETY BUT AS A PRINCIPLE
BOGGS ALEX 223
THEY ELBOWED HIM FROM EVERY POSITION TO WHICH HE HAD A WISH OR A RIGHT EXCEPT PUBLIC RESPECT AND THEY COULD NOT ELBOW HIM FROM THAT UNLESS THEY PUSHED HIS CHARACTER FROM ITS POISE
AS TO RECOGNIZING HER IN PHILADELPHIA HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY
AFTER THEY WERE GONE JOHN SAID
DEAR STILL I COULD SAY MUCH ABOUT THE TIMES AND INSIDINCE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE COMING OF THAT DEAR LITTLE ANGLE JEST SPOKEN OF

JEREMIAH W
AMONG THEM WERE SOME GOOD MECHANICS--ONE EXCELLENT DRESS-MAKER SOME PRIME WAITERS AND CHAMBERMAIDS;--MEN AND WOMEN WITH BRAINS SOME OF THEM EVINCING REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND DECIDED BRAVERY JUST THE KIND OF PASSENGERS THAT GAVE THE GREATEST SATISFACTION TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
NO WAY BUT WALKING WAS OPEN TO THEM
IN AN ENTERPRISE WHERE THEORY AND SENTIMENT WERE FULLY REPRESENTED AND BUSINESS CAPACITY AND WHAT IS CALLED PRACTICAL SENSE WERE COMPARATIVELY RARE HIS TALENTS WERE MOST USEFULLY EMPLOYED
THE NAMES OF THE OVERSEERS WERE GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER
AS HE WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE HE FOUND IT MUCH EASIER TO CLOSE HIS AFFAIRS WITH NORTH CAROLINA THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD HE BEEN ENCUMBERED WITH A FAMILY
ONE OF THE RESULTS OF THIS MEETING WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PHILADELPHIA PORT ROYAL RELIEF COMMITTEE
SO MUCH SO THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS TWENTY-ONE HE WAS WILLING TO PUT INTO PRACTICE HIS VIEWS OF THE SYSTEM BY LEAVING IT AND GOING WHERE ALL MEN ARE FREE
I HAVE HAD NO ANSWER TO THAT LETTER AND I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT OR THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN ME AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED YOURS

JANE JOHNSON OF THE PASSMORE WILLIAMSON SLAVE CASE I FORWARDED SOME OF HER THINGS TO BOSTON A FEW DAYS AGO AND HAD I KNOWN ITS IMPORTANCE IN COURT I COULD HAVE SENT YOU ONE OR TWO WITNESSES WHO WOULD PROVE THAT HER FREEDOM WAS INTENDED BY HER BEFORE SHE LEFT WASHINGTON AND THAT A MAN WAS ENGAGED HERE TO GO ON TO PHILADELPHIA THE SAME DAY WITH HER TO GIVE NOTICE THERE OF HER CASE THOUGH I THINK HE FAILED TO DO SO
HOW TRUE THIS WAS OF OTHER STATIONS WE DO NOT PRETEND TO KNOW OR SPEAK BUT IN THE DIRECTIONS ABOVE ALLUDED TO WE FEEL THAT THE CAUSE WAS PLACED UNDER LASTING OBLIGATIONS
SHE HAD BEEN IN SERVITUDE UNDER MRS CHAPMAN A WIDOW LADY AGAINST WHOM SHE HAD NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE
HE HAD BEEN MARRIED TWICE AND BOTH WIVES WERE BELIEVED TO BE LIVING
FOR SOME TIME AND SOON AFTER I RETURNED BEFORE I EXAMINED THE BOOKS THE FIRE TOOK PLACE AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR MY DELAY
FARMER WM
VERY LITTLE WAS RECORDED OF HIM
HE CHARGED ONE DENNIS MANNARD OF JOHNSONVILLE WITH BEING HIS PERSONAL ENEMY AS AN OPPRESSOR AND ADDED THAT HE COULD SAY NOTHING GOOD OF HIM HE COULD SAY HOWEVER THAT MANNARD WAS BITTERLY OPPOSED TO A SLAVE'S LEARNING HOW TO READ WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THE IDEA OF GIVING THEM ANY PRIVILEGES AND TRIED TO IMPRESS THEM WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY NEEDED TO KNOW NOTHING BUT SIMPLY HOW TO WORK HARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
PLEASE USE YOUR ENDEAVORS
BE KIND ENOUGH TO SEND A FEW LINES TO THE LADY SPOKEN OF FOR THAT MOCKING BIRD AND MUCH OBLIGE ME
WHAT CAUSES THE DELAY OF THAT BOOK THE HISTORY OF PETER STILL'S FAMILY ETC

ALDRIDGE CAROLINE 401
BUT JOHN CALLED OUT TO ROBERT TO DROP OFF THAT HORSE OR HE WOULD SHOOT HIM
SPENCER WM 204
IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE ALL AND GO TO CANADA THE REFUGE FOR THE FLEEING BONDMAN
AT ANOTHER THE TUMULTUOUS SEA--THEN THE LURCHING SHIP--THE BELLOWING COW FRIGHTENED BY THE STORM--THE DEVIL WHO CAME TO CARRY AWAY HER MASTER'S SOUL AND FINALLY THE WEAK DYING MAN AS HE PASSED TO ETERNITY
MY YOUNGEST CHILD IS BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN YEARS OLD THE OTHER BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN

THAT THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION ARE MISTAKEN IN THE IDENTITY OF THE ALLEGED FUGITIVE
HE REMAINED UNDER THE FLOOR TWO WEEKS ACCESSIBLE TO KIND VOICES AND FRIENDLY MINISTRATIONS
I GOT THEM CONVEYED THERE AT HALF FARE AND GAVE THEM LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THOMAS HENNING ESQ AND MRS DR WILLIS TRUSTING THAT THEY WILL BE BETTER CARED FOR IN TORONTO THAN THEY COULD BE AT ST CATHARINES
I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION PAID TO ME WHILE ON THE WAY
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN A MERE ORDINARY SOMETHING MORE THAN EVEN A MURDEROUS RIOT IN ALL THIS
ISAAC HOWEVER COULD TURN THE TABLE ON HIS MASTER BY RUNNING OFF
FRIENDS MIND THE LIGHT AND FOLLOWING THAT GUIDE WHICH LEADS OUT OF ALL EVIL AND INTO ALL GOOD THEY VIEWED EVERY CUSTOM OF SOCIETY WITH EYES UNDIMMED BY PREJUDICE AND WERE INFLUENCED IN EVERY ACTION OF LIFE BY A BELIEF IN THE COMMON BROTHERHOOD OF MAN AND A RESOLVE TO OBEY THE COMMAND OF JESUS TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER
LEWIS HAD NOT ONLY HELD EDWARD IN BONDAGE BUT HAD ACTUALLY SOLD HIM WITH TWO OF HIS BROTHERS ONLY THE SATURDAY BEFORE HIS ESCAPE TO A GEORGIA TRADER NAMED DURANT WHO WAS TO START SOUTH WITH THEM ON THE SUBSEQUENT MONDAY
NEVER PERHAPS WAS A SPEAKER OLD OR YOUNG FAVORED WITH A MORE ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE
VERY DIFFERENT INDEED WERE THESE NOTIONS FROM THOSE HELD BY HIS OWNER WM
O OLD MASTER DON'T CRY FOR ME FOR I AM GOING TO CANADA WHERE COLORED MEN ARE FREE
I WONDER IF MR MINKINS HAS THOUGHT OF ANY WAY THAT HE CAN GET MY WIFE AWAY
IT OCCURRED TO ROBERT THAT HE HAD FREQUENT ACCESS TO THE MONEY DRAWER AND OFTEN IT CONTAINED THE PROCEEDS OF FRESH SALES OF FLESH AND BLOOD
THUS ONCE MORE HE REACHED HIS OLD HOME ALEXANDRIA
HILL JAS 202
SIR:--I HAVE JUST SENT FOR MY SON AUGUSTUS IN ALABAMA
DURING THESE TEN MONTHS HE SUFFERED INDESCRIBABLE HARDSHIPS BUT HE FELT THAT HIS CONDITION IN THE CAVE WAS FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT ON THE PLANTATION UNDER THE CONTROL OF HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR
I WILL GIVE $50 REWARD IF TAKEN IN BALTIMORE CITY OR COUNTY AND $200 IF TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE AND SECURED IN JAIL SO THAT I GET HIM AGAIN
HAVING SEEN WITH JOY THE DESIRE OF HER HEART IN THE FINAL EMANCIPATION OF EVERY BONDMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SHE DEPARTED IN PEACE NOVEMBER 2 1867 IN THE 74TH YEAR OF HER AGE
I SAW A PASSENGER PER THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD YESTERDAY
WHILE HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE HE COULD THINK
AN ARDENT AND PRONOUNCED DISCIPLE OF THE NEW SCHOOL OF PRESBYTERIANS BELONGING TO A STRONGLY OLD SCHOOL PRESBYTERY
AFTER A DAY'S DELAY THE FOLLOWING NOTE CAME TO HAND BUT AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE NO ANSWER WAS RETURNED
IN THE MEMORANDUM BOOK REFERRED TO UNDER DATE OF TWELFTH MO 1835 I FIND THE FOLLOWING NOTE
THEY ARE NOT BLAZONED HEROES FULL OF LOUD DEEDS AND GREAT NAMES BUT QUIET EXAMPLES OF WHAT FORTITUDE CAN ACHIEVE WHERE FREEDOM IS THE GOAL
WE THEREFORE THINK THERE CANNOT BE MUCH RISK AT PRESENT
ABRAM LEFT TWO SISTERS AND ONE BROTHER IN BONDAGE
JOHN PETTIFOOT
HE WAS GOING TO GET A BOAT AND GO TO NEW JERSEY AND THEN TO NEW YORK

YES HE ANSWERED
TWICE A WEEK SHE WAS PERMITTED THE SPECIAL FAVOR OF SEEING HER HUSBAND
SHE WAS TALL AND HER APPEARANCE WAS SUCH AS TO AWAKEN SYMPATHY
THUS IN VIEW OF THE FACTS REFERRED TO AARON WAS LED TO COMMIT THE UNPARDONABLE SIN OF RUNNING AWAY WITH HIS WIFE DAFFNEY WHO BY THE WAY LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN FULLY CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF AND CHILDREN INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM STOLEN AWAY FROM HER AS THOUGH THEY WERE PIGS

HE ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT DECEASED WAS A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS AND HELD FIRMLY TO ITS FAITH THAT GOD LEADS AND INSPIRES MEN TO DO THE WORK HE REQUIRES OF THEM THAT HE SPEAKS WITHIN THE SOUL OF EVERY MAN AND THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUALLY HIS CHILDREN SUBJECT TO HIS GUIDANCE AND THAT ALL SHOULD BE FREE TO FOLLOW WHEREVER THE SPIRIT MIGHT LEAD

WILLIAM WRIGHT CLOSED HIS LONG AND USEFUL LIFE ON THE 25TH OF OCTOBER 1865
WHEN HE WAS QUITE ADVANCED IN YEARS AND THE ANTI-SLAVERY AGITATION GREW WARM HE WAS SOLICITED TO JOIN AN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY BUT ON HEARING THE CONSTITUTION READ AND FINDING THAT IT REPUDIATED ALL USE OF PHYSICAL FORCE ON THE PART OF THE OPPRESSED IN GAINING THEIR LIBERTY HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT ASSENT TO THAT--THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN ENGAGED IN GETTING OFF SLAVES AND THAT HE HAD ALWAYS ADVISED THEM TO USE FORCE ALTHOUGH REMONSTRATING AGAINST GOING TO THE EXTENT OF TAKING LIFE AND THAT NOW HE COULD NOT RECEDE FROM THAT POSITION AND HE DID NOT SEE HOW THEY COULD ALWAYS BE GOT OFF WITHOUT THE USE OF SOME FORCE

GRACE ANNE LEWIS ILLUSTRATION
I HAVE SEEN HER MORE OR LESS EVER SINCE UNTIL WITHIN TWO YEARS
AND THERE WERE LARGER WINDS BLOWING THAN THESE--WINDS RISING IN THE VAST LABORATORIES OF THE GENERAL HUMAN HEART AND DESTINED TO SWEEP INTO ALL THE VAST SPACES OF HUMAN WANT AND WOE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I AM ABLE TO GIVE SOMETHING
AND IT IS ADDED IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS THAT FOR SOME MONTHS BACK GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE STRANGERS AS WELL AS CITIZENS HAVE BEEN HELD FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE VICINITY OF THE PLACE OF THE RECENT OUTBREAKS AT WHICH EXHORTATIONS WERE MADE AND PLEDGES INTERCHANGED TO HOLD THE LAW FOR THE RECOVERY OF FUGITIVE SLAVES AS OF NO VALIDITY AND TO DEFY ITS EXECUTION
RICHARD PERRY WAS LORDING IT OVER BEVERLY WHO WAS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE DARK MEDIUM SIZE AND POSSESSED OF A QUICK INTELLECT--JUST THE MAN THAT AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT IN THE SOUTH COULD APPROACH WITH ASSURANCE WITH QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE--"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SLAVERY DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE FREE WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO GO TO CANADA IF YOU COULD GET OFF SAFELY ETC ETC
I THINK OUR PEOPLE HAVE DEPENED TOO LONG AND TOO MUCH ON FALSE LEGISLATOR LET US NOW LOOK FOR OURSELVES
IN UNBURDENING HIS MIND TO THE COMMITTEE THE ALL-ABSORBING THEME RELATED TO THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED AS A SLAVE AND THE CHARACTER OF THOSE WHO HAD OPPRESSED HIM
LEE CHAS ALIAS THOS
WILBUR
THIS CHATTEL FROM RICHMOND VIRGINIA WAS OF A YELLOW COMPLEXION WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTS OF READING AND WRITING
ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE LAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THE ESCAPE HE HAD BEEN INTENSELY SAVAGE IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING LOST NOT LONG BEFORE TWO OF HIS SERVANTS
DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I WRITE TO YOU FOR MRS SUSAN BELL WHO WAS AT YOUR CITY SOME TIME IN SEPTEMBER LAST
THE WAY DID NOT SEEM OPEN FOR HER TO ACCOMPANY HIM SO HE HAD TO LEAVE HER BEHIND
SON TWENTY-SEVEN
POWELL WHO ATTENDED THE FUNERAL PAID THE FOLLOWING GLOWING TRIBUTE TO THE MORAL RELIGIOUS AND ANTI-SLAVERY CHARACTER OF THE SLAVE'S FRIEND
STILL--DEAR SIR:--I ENCLOSE HEREWITH A DRAFT ON NEW YORK PAYABLE TO YOUR ORDER FOR $100 TO BE PAID ON THE DELIVERY AT PHILADELPHIA OF DANIEL ROBERTSON'S WIFE
I WISH ALL MY BRETHREN AND SISTERS IN BONDAGE WERE AS WELL OFF AS I AM
BEING OF A RESOLUTE AND DETERMINED MIND AND FEELING CONSIDERABLY GALLED BY THE BURDENS HEAPED UPON HIM HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS CHANCES ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
RUSSELL DR BARTHOLOMEW 695-698
IN PARIS HE WAS ALSO RECEIVED WITH DISTINCTION HIS SPECIAL MISSION TO THAT CITY BEING TO ATTEND THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION IN THE CAPACITY OF A DELEGATE FROM THE AMERICAN FREEDMAN'S UNION COMMISSION OF WHICH HE WAS FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT
THE NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE GROUND OF THE BATTLE AND THE FAMILY WHERE YOUNG GORSUCH NOW LIVES AND WHILE THERE WE SAW A DEPOSITION WHICH HE HAD JUST MADE THAT HE BELIEVED NO WHITE PERSONS WERE ENGAGED IN THE AFFRAY BESIDE HIS OWN PARTY
HOWEVER WILL GIVE HIM A PLACE TO BOARD UNTELL HE CAN GET TO WORK
RICHARD IS THIRTY YEARS OLD BUT LOOKS OLDER
THE CAPTAIN AGREED TO THE TERMS AND FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO THE LETTER
JAMES JACKSON AN AGED MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS A QUAKER AND A WELL-KNOWN NON-RESISTANT ABOLITIONIST WAS OF THIS NUMBER
SHE STANDS QUIETLY BESIDE HER DESK AND SPEAKS WITHOUT NOTES WITH GESTURES FEW AND FITTING

SHE WAS MARRIED ABOUT THREE YEARS AFTERWARDS
ALL THE NEAR KIN WHOM SHE NAMED AS HAVING LEFT BEHIND CONSISTED OF A MOTHER AND A BROTHER
HEAVY REWARDS WERE OFFERED THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE BALTIMORE SUN BUT THEY AVAILED NAUGHT
HE MIGHT BE MISTAKEN
SHE WASHED DISHES SCRUBBED ETC
PURNELL CHAS 309
I HARDLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY TERMS
NO DISPOSITION WAS TOO PERVERSE FOR HIS EFFORTS AT REFORM
ALFRED FOUND NO FAULT WITH THE ORDINARY TREATMENT RECEIVED AT THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER
THUS FELLOW-CITIZENS YOU SEE OUR OBJECTS
IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT WITH HER OWN HAND SHE ADMINISTERED TO HUNDREDS
THIS WAS A BUSINESS THAT HENRY HAD NO RELISH FOR
THIS WAS DONE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DETESTATION OF THE WICKED BUSINESS AS MUCH AS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR ME
NEVER WAS THERE A MORE FALSE ASSERTION THAN THAT THE BROAD BRIMMED QUAKERS IN PENNSYLVANIA WERE ACCOMPLICES OF MCCREARY AS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY HAS BEEN A CARDINAL PRINCIPLE OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS FOR A CENTURY
WILLIAMSON WM 441
ABRAM DESCRIBED HIM AS A BIG TALL OLD MAN WHO DRANK AND WAS A REAL WICKED MAN
HE WAS A MULATTO TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF AGE WELL-MADE AND BORE A GRUM COUNTENANCE BUT A BRAVE AND MANLY WILL TO KEEP UP HIS COURAGE ON THE WAY
IN CONCLUSION THEREFORE WITH A VIEW OF PRESENTING HIM IN THE LIGHT OF HIS OWN INTERESTING LETTERS WRITTEN WHEN ABSORBED IN HIS PECULIAR WORK FROM A LARGE NUMBER ON FILE THE FOLLOWING ARE SUBMITTED
AFTER RUNNING MORE THAN A MILE THROUGH THE SNOW THE FUGITIVE CAME TOWARD THE HOUSE
MR STILL IS ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE HE STILL RESIDES
HILL A FUGITIVE APPEALING IN BEHALF OF A POOR SLAVE IN PETERSBURG VA
BEING A MAN OF MARKED NATIVE FORESIGHT HE CONCLUDED THAT THE LESS HE TALKED ABOUT FREEDOM AND THE MORE HE ACTED THE SOONER HE WOULD BE OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
THIS LAST OPERATION SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM MUCH PLEASURE
ORDEE WAS ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE GINGERBREAD COLOR WELL MADE AND INTELLIGENT
OUR INTERVIEW TEN MINUTES
THOUGH HE LOST ALL HIS PROPERTY
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING CONCERNING HIM AND WILL LET ME KNOW IT SO THAT I CAN FIND AND ARREST HIM YOU WILL VERY MUCH OBLIGE YOURS C I.M
IT IS EXPECTED THE OWNERS WILL BE IN TOWN THIS AFTERNOON AND BY THIS ROAD WE GAINED FIVE HOURS TIME WHICH IS A MATTER OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AND WE MAY HAVE OCCASION TO USE IT SOMETIMES IN FUTURE
MULATTO INTELLIGENT AND OF PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE
THE PRISONERS WERE TAKEN CHARGE OF BY THE MARSHALL OF EVANSVILLE.--_APRIL 9TH
STILL N
DESCRIBE HIM SAID THE MEMBER
SHE ALSO HAD A BROTHER IN CHAINS IN MISSISSIPPI
HE COOKED IT HIMSELF AT NIGHT FOR THE NEXT DAY'S USE
THE SAME FORM WITH REGARD TO THESE BILLS WAS EMPLOYED IN THE CASE OF EACH ONE OF THE ACCUSED
BUT IF THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE RICHARD'S CHILDREN OR MOTHER OR FATHER IF THEY ARE LIVING MAY POSSIBLY SEE THESE PAGES AND THEREBY BE MADE GLAD BY LEARNING OF RICHARD'S WISDOM AS A TRAVELER IN THE TERRIBLE DAYS OF SLAVE-HUNTING
$500 WILL BE PAID FOR THE APPREHENSION OF EITHER SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM AGAIN
ISAAC SAID THAT HE COULD NOT RECOMMEND HIS MISTRESS AS SHE WAS GIVEN TO BAD PRACTICES SO MUCH SO THAT HE COULD HARDLY ENDURE HER
SAM HAD SEEN TOO MANY WHO HAD STOOD EXACTLY IN THE SAME RELATIONS TO SLAVERY AND FREEDOM AND NOT A FEW WERE HELD OVER THEIR TIME OR CHEATED OUT OF THEIR FREEDOM ALTOGETHER
WHEELER BALLARD AND CURTIS WERE FOUND GUILTY THE REST NOT GUILTY THE GUILTY WERE GIVEN ABOUT A WEEK IN JAIL
HE BELONGED TO THE OLD SIDE METHODIST CHURCH WAS A MAN WITH A FAMILY AND FOLLOWED FARMING OR HAD FARMING DONE BY ME AND OTHERS
IN A MOMENT SHE WAS UP AGAIN WITH HER BRUSH ON HER BACK AND AN HOUR AFTERWARDS THE OVERSEER WAS WHIPPING HER MY TURN CAME WHAT IS THE REASON YOU CAN'T GET UP THE HILL FASTER EXCLAIMED THE OVERSEER AT THE SAME TIME HE STRUCK ME WITH A COWHIDE
SUBSEQUENTLY HE WAS SENT TO WORK ON THE POSSUM TAIL RAILROAD
SO IN COMPANY WITH FIVE OTHERS AT AN APPOINTED TIME HE SET OUT FOR FREEDOM AND SUCCEEDED
WHAT SHALL I SAY
THE SUBJECT OF THIS SKETCH WAS A YOUNG MULATTO WOMAN TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE WHO FLED FROM THE CITY OF BALTIMORE
HE SAID THAT MR B
LITTLE HAD THE OLD MAN DREAMED IN HIS DAYS OF SADNESS THAT HE SHOULD SHARE SUCH A FEAST OF JOY OVER THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS SONS
HAMILTON JUNE 26TH 1856 MR
TAKING A LIGHTED CANDLE FROM THE KITCHEN AND CARRYING IT UP STAIRS THEY WENT DIRECTLY TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE POOR GIRL LAY IN A SOUND SLEEP
WE HAVE TELEGRAPHED TO DIFFERENT POINTS TO TRY TO GET SOME INFORMATION CONCERNING THEM BUT FAILED
TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THIS COMING MARCH Q
THIS SUM HE CONSIDERED AMPLE TO START WITH
HOW SHE SUCCEEDED IN SO DOING THE RECORD BOOK FAILS TO EXPLAIN
THIS MOUNTAIN WAS FOLLOWED IN ITS COURSE BY HUNDREDS OF FUGITIVES UNTIL THEY GOT INTO PENNSYLVANIA AND WERE DIRECTED TO WILLIAM WRIGHT'S HOUSE
THE COMMITTEE EXTENDED TO THEM THE USUAL HOSPITALITIES IN THE WAY OF BOARD ACCOMMODATIONS AND FREE TICKETS CANADAWARD AND WISHED THEM A SAFE AND SPEEDY PASSAGE
IT HAD BEEN INTERCEPTED AND IN THIS WAY A CLUE WAS OBTAINED BY ONE OF THE OWNERS AS TO HOW THEY ESCAPED WHO AIDED THEM ETC

THE HOUSES OF RESPECTABLE AND WORTHY COLORED CITIZENS WERE BROKEN IN UPON THE FURNITURE SCATTERED TO THE WINDS ALL THEY POSSESSED DESTROYED OR PLUNDERED AND THEY THEMSELVES SUBJECTED TO THE MOST BRUTAL AND SAVAGE TREATMENT
IN THE LONG LIST OF NAMES WHO HAVE SUFFERED AND DIED IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM NOT ONE PERHAPS COULD BE FOUND WHOSE EFFORTS TO REDEEM A POOR FAMILY OF SLAVES WERE MORE CHRISTLIKE THAN SETH CONCKLIN'S WHOSE NOBLE AND DARING SPIRIT HAS BEEN SO LONG COMPLETELY SHROUDED IN MYSTERY
SPENT EIGHTEEN DAYS IN THE TRIAL OF A
WHITSON WAS ENGAGED IN THE FREE LABOR STORE AT THE CORNER OF FIFTH AND CHERRY STREETS NEAR THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE
IT WAS QUITE MANIFEST THAT SHE HAD NOT LET A SINGLE OPPORTUNITY SLIDE BUT SEIZED THE FIRST CHANCE AND ARRIVED PARTLY BY MEANS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND PARTLY BY THE REGULAR TRAIN
THE STATE OFFICERS SWORE HE SHOULD NOT AND FOR A WHILE IT SEEMED THAT NOTHING COULD AVERT A BLOODY SCENE
HIS WIFE AS REPRESENTED BY THE LIKENESS WAS OF FAIR COMPLEXION PREPOSSESSING AND GOOD LOOKING--PERHAPS NOT OVER THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE
AS A MEMBER OF THE COURT BEFORE WHICH THE ACCUSED PERSONS MAY HEREAFTER BE ARRAIGNED AND TRIED I HAVE SOUGHT TO KEEP MY MIND ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANY IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR GUILT OR INNOCENCE AND EVEN FROM AN EXTRA-JUDICIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MUST DETERMINE THE LEGAL CHARACTER OF THE OFFENCE THAT HAS THUS BEEN PERPETRATED
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN MY MISTRESS AND HER CHILDREN AND HER FRIENDS WHO ALL MET AFTER MASTER DIED THAT I WAS TO TAKE CARE OF MISTRESS AND AFTER MISTRESS DIED I SHOULD NOT SERVE ANYBODY ELSE

NOT MANY WEEKS WERE ALLOWED TO PASS BEFORE SHE RESOLVED TO AGAIN MAKE A BOLD STRIKE FOR FREEDOM
I ALWAYS WISHED TO BE FREE AND MEANT TO BE FREE WHEN I CAME NORTH
ABE WAS TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE PURE BLACK ORDINARY SIZE AND SPIRITED A THOROUGH CONVERT TO THE DOCTRINE THAT ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN HELD IN BONDAGE UP TO THE HOUR OF HIS ESCAPE HE GAVE MUCH REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE AN EASY SUBJECT TO MANAGE UNDER THE YOKE IF EVER CAPTURED AND CARRIED BACK
ACCORDING TO THEIR CONFESSION CHARLES AND WILLIAM IT SEEMED HAD BEEN THINKING A GOOD DEAL OVER THE IDEA OF WORKING FOR NOTHING OF BEING DAILY DRIVEN TO SUPPORT OTHERS WHILE THEY WERE RENDERED MISERABLE THEREBY
BUT HIS CHILDREN DIFFERENTLY EDUCATED AND TRAINED BY CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT FEEL POLITICAL INFERIORITY RATHER A BITTER CUP AFTER ALL WHETHER THEY ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE ME I BELONG TO THIS RACE AND WHEN IT IS DOWN I BELONG TO A DOWN RACE

IT WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN GROUND DOWN ALL THEIR LIVES TO APPEAR AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN ENJOYING FREEDOM
THE SISTERS WERE SO THOROUGHLY UNITED IN THEIR WORK AS WELL AS IN ALL THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE THAT THIS BRIEF SKETCH HAS NOT ATTEMPTED WHAT INDEED IT COULD NOT HAVE ACHIEVED--A SEPARATION OF THEIR SPHERES OF BENEFICENT ACTIVITY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SALE HEZEKIAH BUNDLED HIS NEW PURCHASE OFF TO ALABAMA WHERE HE SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING HIM ONLY ABOUT TWO YEARS FOR AT THE END OF THAT TIME JOHN DETERMINED TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR LIBERTY
I BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME EFFORT MADE TO RELEASE SOME OF THE PRISONERS
ON THE CONTRARY THEY GAVE HER JUST SUCH A CHARACTER AS THE LADY MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH IN THE MAIN
OF COURSE SUCH OF HER SLAVE POPULATION AS MANAGED TO BECOME INITIATED IN THE MYSTERIES OF TRAVELING NORTH BY THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WERE SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO FIND OUT NEARER AND SAFER ROUTES THAN THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA
BUT STILL I HOPE FOR A CHANGE OF MIND IN MY ENEMIES AND SHALL PRESS ONWARD TO ACCOMPLISH THE GREAT TASK SEEMINGLY ALLOTTED TO ME UPON KENTUCKY SOIL THE PERSECUTED BEREANS.--THERE IS ANOTHER CALL CONNECTED WITH KENTUCKY WHICH WE WISH TO BRING BEFORE OUR FRIENDS

I ADVISE HIM TO HURRY ON TO CANADA
HE SEEMS TO HAVE SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT FEAR WAS AND THOUGH IRATE SLAVE-HOLDERS OFTEN CALLED ON HIM TO LEARN THE WHEREABOUTS OF THEIR SLAVES HE MET THEM PLACIDLY NEVER DENIED HAVING HELPED THE FUGITIVES ON THEIR WAY POSITIVELY REFUSED TO GIVE THEM ANY INFORMATION AND WHEN THEY FLOURISHED PISTOLS OR BOWIE-KNIVES TO ENFORCE THEIR DEMANDS HE CALMLY PUSHED THE WEAPONS ASIDE AND TOLD THEM THAT NONE BUT COWARDS RESORTED TO SUCH MEANS TO CARRY THEIR ENDS

HOW MUCH TRUTH THERE WAS IN THE CONSTABLE'S STORY TO THE EFFECT THAT A COLORED MAN IN PHILADELPHIA WHO PROFESSED TO BE A GREAT FRIEND OF THE COLORED PEOPLE WAS A TRAITOR ETC THE COMMITTEE NEVER LEARNED
WHEN IN LONDON IN 1840 SHE VISITED THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS AND A GENTLEMAN OF THE PARTY POINTING OUT THE SPLENDID PLUMAGE OF SOME TROPICAL BIRDS REMARKED
BUT SHE POSSESSED A WELL TRIED FAITH WHICH IN HER FLIGHT KEPT HER FROM DESPONDENCY
AND SINCE THE FIRST ADVENT OF MY BOOK WHEREVER REVIEWED OR READ BY LEADING FRIENDS OF FREEDOM THE PRESS OR THE RACE MORE DEEPLY REPRESENTED BY IT THE EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGEMENT HAVE BEEN HEARTY AND UNANIMOUS AND THE THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD BY ME ON THE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN WITH HARDLY ANY FACILITIES FOR THE WORK MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT IT WOULD IN THE HANDS OF A COMPETENT PUBLISHER HAVE A WIDE CIRCULATION
THE CHARACTER AND CAREER OF THE LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO BE DWELT ON HERE
ON BEING ASKED WHY HE GRIEVED HIS ANSWER WAS
MR TRAVERSE BELONGED TO THE METHODIST CHURCH AND WAS DESCRIBED BY AARON AS A BAD YOUNG MAN

IN THE HEARTS OF MANY OF THE MORE INTELLIGENT AMONGST THE SLAVES THE MEN AS MECHANICS ETC THE WOMEN AS DRESS-MAKERS CHAMBER-MAIDS ETC NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE OPPOSITION AND HARD LAWS THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM WAS STEADILY BURNING
AND IN OCTOBER 1835 HE ACCEPTED A PULPIT IN WOMELSDORF BERKS COUNTY PA WHERE HE PREACHED FOR ONE YEAR TO A PRESBYTERIAN CONGREGATION TO WHAT PURPOSE AND WITH WHAT VIEWS MAY BE LEARNED FROM THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE TAKEN FROM ONE OF HIS LETTERS WRITTEN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS TO THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD
THE MAN WHO MASTERED IT OVER HIM WAS CALLED NATHANIEL DIXON AND LIVED IN SOMERSET CO NEAR NEWTOWN
IN THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY CHEERED THE CAUSE
I HAVE SIMPLY TRIED TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF MY SOUL BEFORE GOD AND TO DO MY DUTY IN EDINBURGH THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY WAS CONFERRED UPON HIM WITH IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIES--HE BEING THE THIRD AMERICAN EVER THUS HONORED
BROWN SAID THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN FOUND IT NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN HIS WITNESSES REPUTATION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PECULIAR DILEMMA THEY HAD GOT INTO HE WOULD OBJECT AND IF HE SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO CONTRADICT THEM IN SOME POINT IN THE DEFENCE HE CERTAINLY WAS RIGHT BUT AS THE CASE COULD NOT BE CONCLUDED TO-DAY HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE MATTER ADJOURNED OVER UNTIL TUESDAY NEXT
THE INQUISITION COMMONLY CALLED THE LEGISLATURE BEING IN SESSION IN RICHMOND HEARING THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT HAD BEEN SPEAKING WELL OF SMITH AND CIRCULATING A PETITION FOR HIS PARDON INDIGNANTLY DEMANDED TO KNOW IF THE RUMOR WAS WELL FOUNDED
RESEMBLED AN IRISHMAN THE COMING OF THIS STRANGE-LOOKING INDIVIDUAL CAUSED MUCH SURPRISE REPRESENTING AS HE DID IF NOT A FULL-BLOODED IRISHMAN A MAN OF IRISH DESCENT
BUT IT WAS NOT SLAVERY ALONE WHICH OCCUPIED THE THOUGHTS AND ATTENTION OF THIS LARGE-HEARTED MAN
AFTER THIS JOYFUL EVENT THEY PROCEEDED TO TORONTO AND WERE THERE GLADLY RECEIVED BY THE LADIES SOCIETY FOR AIDING COLORED REFUGEES

THEY APPEAR UNDER COVER FROM FIRST TO LAST
SHE WAS UNFORTUNATE IN LOSING HIM AS SHE WAS LIVING IN EASE AND LUXURY OFF OF JEFFERSON'S SWEAT AND LABOR
YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN SOON

DRANK VERY HARD AT WHICH TIMES HE WOULD SWEAR THAT HE WOULD SELL THEM ALL TO GEORGIA THIS THREAT WAS ALWAYS UNPLEASANT TO THE EARS OF JAMES BUT IT SEEMED TO BE A SATISFACTION TO THE MASTER

ACCORDING TO WILLIAM'S TESTIMONY OF TIMES MRS TWYNE WOULD MEDDLE TOO FREELY WITH THE CUP AND WHEN UNDER ITS INFLUENCE SHE WAS VERY DESPERATE AND ACTED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO KILL SOME OF THE SLAVES AFTER THE EVIL SPIRIT LEFT HER AND SHE HAD REGAINED HER WONTED COMPOSURE SHE WOULD PRETEND THAT SHE LOVED HER NEGROES AND WOULD MAKE A GREAT FUSS OVER THEM

AT TIMES THE CURRENT OF THOUGHTS FLOWED IN ELOQUENT AND POETIC EXPRESSION AND OFTEN HER QUAINT HUMOR WOULD EXPOSE THE IVORY IN HALF A THOUSAND MOUTHS
DEPEE
HAVING BEEN LONG KNOWN AS A FIRM FRIEND OF THE RIGHTS OF THE COLORED MAN AND BEING AMONGST THE MOST EFFICIENT PUBLIC ADVOCATES OF HIS CAUSE HE WAS OF COURSE SUBJECTED TO THE REVILINGS WHICH WERE SO LIBERALLY HEAPED UPON THE ABOLITIONISTS AT THAT TIME
OH WHEN WILL WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HUMAN LIFE SAFE
CARMAN ESQ HEAD CLERK OF THE COUNTY COURT HE BORE VOLUNTARY TESTIMONY TO CARMAN IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
WHERE SO MANY PARTIES ON ESCAPING HAD THE GOOD SENSE AND COURAGE TO SECURE THEIR FLIGHT BY BRINGING THEIR MASTERS HORSES AND CARRIAGES A GOOD WAY ON THEIR PERILOUS JOURNEY
OH IF I COULD ONLY SEE OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AIMING TO BUILD UP A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES WHICH WOULD GRANDLY CONTRAST WITH THE PAST--WITH ITS PAIN IGNORANCE AND LOW SOCIAL CONDITION IT MAY BE WELL TO ADD THAT MRS HARPER'S LETTERS FROM WHICH WE HAVE COPIED WERE SIMPLY PRIVATE NEVER INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION
HALL CHAS 502
SAMUEL RHOADS DIED IN 1868
MRS MYERS WAS ORIGINALLY FROM BALTIMORE AND HAD FREQUENTLY BEEN IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS
I HAVE SEEN IT TOWERING UP IN SIMPLE GRANDEUR WITH THE GENTLE POTOMAC GLIDING PEACEFULLY AT ITS FEET AND FELT THAT THAT WAS GOD'S MASONRY AND MY SOUL HAD EXPANDED IN GAZING ON ITS SUBLIMITY
THOUGH HE RECEIVED FIVE DREADFUL STABS AIMED AT HIS HEART BY A BRIBED ASSASSIN NEVERTHELESS HE STILL REJOICES IN THE MOTIVES WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO UNDO THE HEAVY BURDENS AND LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE HAVING RESIDED NEARLY ALL HIS LIFE IN THE SOUTH WHERE HE HAD TRAVELED AND SEEN MUCH OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION AND HAD WITNESSED THE MOST HORRID ENORMITIES INFLICTED UPON THE SLAVE WHOSE CRIES WERE EVER RINGING IN HIS EARS AND FOR WHOM HE HAD THE WARMEST SYMPATHY MR SMITH COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM BELIEVING THAT THE BLACK MAN AS WELL AS THE WHITE HAD GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS
FEAR YOU NOT THAT IRON ROD WITH WHICH HE BREAKS HIS FOES
IN LEAVING THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES THEY BROKE KINDRED TIES OF THE TENDEREST NATURE
ISRAEL WHITNEY
AND A TRANSCRIPT OF SUCH RECORD AUTHENTICATED BY THE ATTESTATION OF THE CLERK AND OF THE SEAL OF SAID COURT BEING PRODUCED IN ANY OTHER STATE TERRITORY OR DISTRICT IN WHICH THE PERSON SO ESCAPING MAY BE FOUND AND BEING EXHIBITED TO ANY JUDGE COMMISSIONER OR OTHER OFFICER AUTHORIZED BY THE LAW OF THE UNITED STATES TO CAUSE PERSONS ESCAPING FROM SERVICE OR LABOR TO BE DELIVERED UP SHALL BE HELD AND TAKEN TO BE FULL AND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT OF ESCAPE AND THAT THE SERVICE OR LABOR OF THE PERSON ESCAPING IS DUE TO THE PARTY IN SUCH RECORD MENTIONED
BUT NO TIDINGS CAME IN ANSWER TO HER MANY PRAYERS UNTIL ONE OF THEM TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF HIS RELATIVES TURNED UP IN PHILADELPHIA NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF AGE SEEKING HIS LONG-LOST PARENTS
NELSON 440
MASTER AND MISTRESS WERE BOTH MEMBERS OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH
AT THE APPOINTED TIME JACOB'S BONDAGE ENDED AND HE CONCLUDED THAT HE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER BY MOVING TO BALTIMORE

THEY RECEIVED PASSENGERS FROM THOMAS GARRETT AND SOMETIMES OTHERS PERHAPS OF WILMINGTON WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT UNSAFE TO SEND THEM THENCE DIRECTLY THROUGH PHILADELPHIA
RISING UP IN HIS BOX HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND SAYING HOW DO YOU DO GENTLEMEN THE LITTLE ASSEMBLAGE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO THINK OR DO AT THE MOMENT
DAVID THE HUSBAND OF THIS WOMAN WAS ABOUT THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE
PIERCE ESQRS APPEARED FOR EUPHEMIA R.C
FOR THE COLORED MAN NO HISTORY CAN BE MORE INSTRUCTIVE AND INSPIRING THAN THIS OF HIS OWN MAKING AND WRITTEN BY ONE OF HIS OWN RACE
BUT WENT AFTERWARDS TO TAKE THEM OUT OF JAIL UPON A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS WHEN THEY SEIZED HIM TOO AND LODGED HIM IN PRISON
W.D
WILLIAM STILL AUTHOR
BUT REMAIN YOURS AND A TRUE FRIEND ONTELL DEATH
I SEND YOU THREE COPIES OF MY PAPER
THUS IT MAY BE SEEN THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS A FIRM BELIEVER IN WIVES AS WELL AS SLAVES
SHE WAS A VERY CLEVER WOMAN
IN JUSTICE THEREFORE TO THE HEROIC FEMALE WHO WAS WILLING TO ENDURE THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING AND HARDSHIP FOR FREEDOM DOUBLE HONORS WERE DUE
WHEN YOU WRITE PLEASE INFORM ME WHAT SIGNS OR SYMBOLS YOU MAKE USE OF IN YOUR DESPATCHES AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION IN RELATION TO OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IF THERE IS A PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT DESERVES THE HEARTY CO-OPERATION OF EVERY FRIEND OF HUMANITY THAT PERSON IS ARRAH WEEMS WHO NOW AFTER A LONG SERIES OF SELF-SACRIFICING LABOR TO AID OTHERS IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR THEIR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS SOLICITS A SMALL AMOUNT TO REDEEM THE LAST ONE OF HER OWN CHILDREN IN SLAVERY
HE HAD COME FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF JOHN P
HAVING HEARD OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RUNNING TO CANADA HE CONCLUDED TO TAKE A TRIP AND SEE THE COUNTRY FOR HIMSELF
EVEN THE NEW YORK BROADWAY BULLIES WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO UTTER A WORD OF INSULT MUCH LESS LIFT A FINGER AGAINST WM
THE LAND WAS POOR BUT THE SITUATION BEAUTIFUL WITH GOOD WATER AND A FAVORABLE LOCATION IN SOME RESPECTS
I CAN THANK GOD THAT UPON ITS WARP AND WOOF I SEE NO STAIN OF BLOOD AND TEARS
FIFTH LETTER
HE HAS AIDED MORE SLAVES TO ESCAPE THAN ANY OTHER MAN BISHOP LOUGAN OF SYRACUSE PERHAPS EXCEPTED
STILL:--I HAVE A MIXTURE OF GOOD AND BAD NEWS FOR YOU
WHEN HE LOST TIME BY SICKNESS OR RAINY WEATHER HE WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCY ALSO FIND HIS CLOTHING
IF I KNEW WHERE TO FIND HER I WOULD FIND OUT WHAT SHE HAS WRITTEN
HERE SHE AVERRED THAT SHE HAD BEEN FLOGGED REPEATEDLY AND HAD BEEN OTHERWISE ILL-TREATED WHILE NO ONE INTERFERED TO TAKE HER PART
WASHINGTON ELIZA 334
CATHER
HE WAS OWNED BY A FARMER NAMED JAMES PITTMAN A CRABID KIND OF A MAN GREY-HEADED WITH A BROKEN LEG
THOMAS NIXON WAS ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK HUE AND QUITE INTELLIGENT
HE FORSOOK HIS MOTHER FOUR BROTHERS AND THREE SISTERS WITH NO HOPE OF EVER SEEING THEM AGAIN
SOMETIMES RIGHT SMART AND THEN AGAIN BAD ENOUGH FOR IT SAID CHRISTOPHER
HIS HOME NEAR PHOENIXVILLE CHESTER COUNTY PA WAS AN IMPORTANT STATION ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THE MAJORITY OF FUGITIVES PROCEEDING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN RURAL DISTRICTS OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA PASSING THROUGH HIS HANDS
I WANTS TO HEAR FROM MY MOTHER VERY MUCH BUT CANNOT HEAR ONE WORD
I SAID NO--NOT EXACTLY A BROTHER
AND THAT IT ONLY NEEDED ENFORCEMENT BY THE CHOICE OF THE BALLOT-BOX TO BRING THE SOUTH EITHER TO AN AMICABLE OR A HOSTILE SETTLEMENT OF THE QUESTION
THIS HISTORY OF THE HARDSHIPS AND STRUGGLES OF THOSE OF THEIR OWN RACE IS MORE FOR THEM THAN FOR MANKIND AT LARGE
DEATH IS THE WORST THAT CAN BEFALL US IF SO BE THAT WE ARE FAITHFUL TO THE RIGHT
HE HAD BEEN TO WILLIAM AND MARY'S COLLEGE IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS TO WAIT ON YOUNG MASTER JAMES B.C WHERE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF SOME OF THE STUDENTS HE HAD PICKED UP A TRIFLING AMOUNT OF BOOK LEARNING
JOHN BROWN THIS WAS AN ADOPTED NAME THE ORIGINAL ONE NOT BEING PRESERVED LEFT TO GET RID OF HIS CONNECTION WITH THOMAS STEVENS A GROCER LIVING IN BALTIMORE
HIS FATHER ONE SISTER AND TWO BROTHERS WERE ALL DEAR TO HIM BUT ALL BEING SLAVES ONE COULD NOT HELP THE OTHER ANTHONY REASONED AND WISELY TOO
HE THEN RETURNED AND SPENT ANOTHER WINTER WITH THE LEWISES ASSISTING IN THE HOUSEHOLD WORK AND RENDERING SERVICES INVALUABLE AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN FEMALE HELP
AND SOME OF THEM WENT SO FAR AS TO OFFER A REWARD TO SOME OF THE COLORED SERVANTS TO GAIN A KNOWLEDGE OF HER WHEREABOUTS
AT THE SALE OF ONE OF HER CHILDREN SHE WAS SO AFFECTED WITH GRIEF THAT SHE WAS THROWN INTO VIOLENT CONVULSIONS WHICH CAUSED THE LOSS OF HER SPEECH FOR ONE ENTIRE MONTH
SOMETIMES THE ABOLITIONISTS WERE MUCH ANNOYED BY IMPOSTORS WHO PRETENDED TO BE RUNAWAYS IN ORDER TO DISCOVER THEIR PLANS AND BETRAY THEM TO THE SLAVE-HOLDERS
THE STRANGER THEN SAID I HAVE COME FROM VIRGINIA IN BEHALF OF MAJOR RONEY IN SEARCH OF HIS BOY TUCKER WHITE
BEFORE THAT PHILLIPS FATHER HAD DEFRAUDED HIM OF HIS HIRE
WILLIAM SOON HAD MATTERS ARRANGED FOR TRAVELING NORTH
WHEN HIS FRIENDS EXPRESSED THEIR ANXIETY FOR HIS SAFETY HE ALWAYS ALLAYED THEIR APPREHENSIONS AND EVINCED BY THE FIRMNESS AND BENIGNITY OF HIS MANNER THAT HE WAS DIVESTED OF THE FEAR OF MAN AND ACTED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SPIRIT WHICH IS FROM ABOVE
IF YOU DESIRE TO HEAR FROM ME AGAIN OR IF YOU SHOULD LEARN ANY THING SPECIFIC FROM MR CONCKLIN BE PLEASED TO WRITE ME AT CINCINNATI WHERE I EXPECT TO BE IN A SHORT TIME
THE EFFECT OF THE CLUBS BROUGHT THEM PROSTRATE IN THE ROAD IN AN ATTITUDE RESEMBLING TWO MEN DREAMING IT WAS IN THE NIGHT THE VICTORIOUS PASSENGERS SEEING THAT THE SMASHED UP CARRIAGE COULD BE OF NO FURTHER USE TO THEM QUICKLY CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF UNHITCHING AND ATTEMPTING FURTHER PURSUIT ON HORSEBACK
THAT HIS MASTER WAS A MAN OF MEANS AND PRETTY HIGH STANDING"--JULIUS THOUGHT WAS NOT MUCH TO HIS CREDIT SINCE THEY WERE OBTAINED FROM UNPAID LABOR
TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEART OF SUCH A POOR SLAVE MOTHER AND TO AID SUCH TENDER PLANTS AS WERE THESE LITTLE GIRLS FROM SUCH A WRETCHED STATE OF BARBARISM AS EXISTED IN POOR LITTLE DELAWARE WAS DOUBLY GRATIFYING TO THE COMMITTEE
THREE PAIRS COTTON STOCKINGS 4 $1,50
HE CIRCUMVENTED AS ADROITLY AS THE MOST PRACTICED POLITICIAN
HAD I BEEN ABLE TO COMMAND THIS I SHOULD NOT BE NECESSITATED TO ASK THE FAVORS AND INDULGENCES I DO
THE RULE FORBADE ANY COLORED PERSON LEAVING THERE BY RAIL ROAD OR STEAMBOAT WITHOUT SUCH APPLICANT HAD BEEN WEIGHED MEASURED AND THEN GIVEN A BOND SIGNED BY UNQUESTIONABLE SIGNATURES WELL KNOWN
HE LEFT HIS WIFE ELIZABETH WITH FOUR CHILDREN IN BONDAGE
IT IS MORE WITH A VIEW OF DOING JUSTICE TO A BRAVE INTELLIGENT CLASS WHOM THE PUBLIC ARE IGNORANT OF THAN MERELY TO GIVE SPECIAL PROMINENCE TO JOHN AND HIS RELATIVES AS INDIVIDUALS THAT THESE LETTERS ARE GIVEN
LIKEWISE SHE REGRETTED HAVING TO LEAVE THREE BROTHERS WHO KINDLY AIDED HER TO ESCAPE
WHILE UNDER THE ROOF OF MR JACKSON AS HOBSON ADVERTISED AND DESCRIBED HENRY SO ACCURATELY AND OFFERED A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR HIM HENRY'S FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD RETURN HIM THE COMPLIMENT BY PUBLISHING HIM IN THE BOSTON PAPERS QUITE AS ACCURATELY IF NOT WITH AS HIGH A REWARD FOR HIM
JOHN HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THE PERSON OF HIS BROTHER GEORGE
ONE YEAR FROM THE PASSAGE OF THE LAW AT A TIME WHEN ALARM AND EXCITEMENT WERE RUNNING HIGH THE MOST DECIDED STAND WAS TAKEN AT CHRISTIANA IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA TO DEFEAT THE LAW AND DEFEND FREEDOM
A PASSAGE WAS SECURED FOR HIM ON A STEAMER BOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA
NO SAID THE SLAVE-HOLDER
DEAR FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--IT IS A GOOD PLAN TO SEND ME THESE INTERESTING COMMUNICATIONS
SHE HAD NO OTHER SERVANTS Q

YOURS OF 12MO
THE WOODS HOWEVER WERE BEING HUNTED IN EVERY DIRECTION AND ONE DAY THE PURSUERS CAME UPON THEM SHOT THEM BOTH AND CARRIED THEM TO KING GEORGE'S CO
THE IDEA OF HAVING HAD A WHITE FATHER IN MANY INSTANCES DEPRECIATED THE PECUNIARY VALUE OF MALE SLAVES IF NOT OF THE OTHER SEX
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY OUR LEGISLATORS FOR THE PROTECTION OF SLAVE PROPERTY IS EVIDENT FROM THE VARIETY OF CONSTRUCTIONS PUT UPON THE STATUTE IN THIS CASE AND WE TRUST THAT AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE LEGISLATURE THERE WILL BE SUCH AMENDMENTS AS TO MAKE THE LAW ON THIS SUBJECT PERFECTLY CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIBLE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF EVERY ONE
HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN OWNED BY COL
DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SLAVERY MUCH WAS DONE BY THIS SOCIETY FOR THE DIFFUSION OF AN ANTI-SLAVERY GOSPEL

PHILIP HENRY HARRIET ANN AND JANE ELIZABETH
I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU AND YOUR KIND FAMILY TO WHOM REMEMBER ME VERY CORDIALLY
THOUGH RESISTED BRUTALLY BY THE SHERIFF WITH REVOLVER IN HAND THEY MADE THEIR WAY DOWN ONE FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND IN THE MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT PLUNGED INTO THE SHERIFF'S PRIVATE APARTMENT WHERE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE SLEEPING
DIRECT YOUR LETTER TO THE POST OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BUT THE GOVERNOR OFFERED HER HIS HAND AND THEY BECAME UNITED IN WEDLOCK
I WROTE TO YOU A FEW DAYS AGO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU GOT MY LETTER
NO MAN AT THAT DAY NOT EVEN EMINENT JUDGES AND ADVOCATES WAS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE INTRICACIES OF LAW QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH SLAVERY
TORONTO FEB
FROM THE NEWBURYPORT HERALD MASS IT IS NOT A ROMANCE BUT IT IS A STOREHOUSE OF MATERIALS WHICH WILL HEREAFTER BE USED IN LITERATURE AND BE STUDIED NOT ONLY BY HISTORIANS DRAMATISTS AND NOVELISTS BUT ALSO BY THOSE WHO WILL SEEK TO COMPREHEND AND REALIZE THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY A CONDITION OF SOCIETY AND LAW WHICH MADE THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD POSSIBLE
MICHAEL WORKED IN A FOUNDRY
DURING THE INTERVIEW AN UNOPENED TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH WHICH HAD COME TO HAND DURING THE WRITER'S ABSENCE LAY ON THE DESK
HE SAID VERY FEW WERE IN THE CITY WHO COULD OUTRUN HIM
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND LAST THING AT NIGHT YOU WOULD HEAR HIM CUSSING--HE WOULD CUSS IN BED
THEY WERE CAPABLE OF GIVING THE BEST OF REASONS FOR THE ENDEAVORS THEY WERE MAKING TO ESCAPE TO A FREE COUNTRY
TORONTO APRIL 25 1857
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD FOR COMFORT BUT I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE WITH TEN THOUSAND SLAVE THAT ARE EQUEL WITH THEIR MASTERS
ON THE CONTRARY SHE REPEATEDLY SAID DISTINCTLY AND FIRMLY I AM NOT FREE BUT I WANT MY FREEDOM_--ALWAYS WANTED TO BE FREE
I REJOISE TO HEAR FROM YOU I FEEL VERY MUCH INDETTED TO YOU FOR NOT WRITING BEFORE BUT I HAVE BEEN SO BISSY THAT IS THE CAUSE I REJOISE TO HEARE OF THE ARRIVAL OF MY WIFE AND HOPE SHE IS NOT SICK FROM THE ROLING OF THE SEA AND IF SHE IS NOT PLEAS TO SEND HER ON HERE MONDAY WITH A SIX BARAL WARLIAN AND A RIFALL TO GARD HER UP TO MY RESIDANCE I THANK YOU KINDLY FOR THE GOOD THAT YOU HAVE DON FOR ME
IT WAS HOWEVER A STRANGE OCCURRENCE AND VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
PLEASE FORWARD ANY NEWS RELATIVE TO THE CAPT
JOHN BELIEVED THAT ON THIS ACCOUNT ALL PRIVILEGES WERE DENIED HIM AND HE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE
H ELIZABETH AND MARY ELLEN
LOUD CHEERS SIR THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN IN ENGLAND
SHE LEFT HER MOTHER ONE BROTHER AND ONE SISTER IN LOUISVILLE
THE SIX WERE TO START LAST NIGHT FOR THIS PLACE
FOR HOW MOURNFUL IT IS WHEN THE UNRIGHTED WRONGS AND FEARFUL AGONIES OF AGES REACH THEIR CULMINATING POINT AND EVENTS SOLEMN TERRIBLE AND SUBLIME MARSHAL THEMSELVES IN DREAD ARRAY TO MOULD THE DESTINY OF NATIONS THE HANDS APPOINTED TO HOLD THE HELM OF AFFAIRS INSTEAD OF GRASPING THE MIGHTY OCCASIONS AND STAMPING THEM WITH THE GREAT SEALS OF DUTY AND RIGHT PERMIT THEM TO FLOAT ALONG THE CURRENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT COMPREHENDING THE HOUR OF VISITATION OR THE MOMENTOUS DAY OF OPPORTUNITY
I PRESUME YOU HAVE RECEIVED THAT LETTER

BURRELL JAMES 223
I HAVE SOMETHING AT HOME TO FIX THE YEAR
ON ARRIVING HIS SHOES WERE GONE AND HIS FEET WERE SEVERELY TRAVEL-WORN
THESE ARE EMBRACED IN THE ACT OF CONGRESS ON THE 30TH OF SEPT 1790 CH
THIS CASE WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND HAS CREATED IN THE PUBLIC MIND A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST--IT BEING THE FIRST CASE OF THE KIND EVER HAVING OCCURRED IN OUR COUNTRY
THE INMATES WERE PUT OUT ON TENTH STREET--NOT AT ANY HOUSE--AFTER WHICH THEY SOON FOUND HOSPITABLE FRIENDS AND QUIETUDE
INDIGNANT AT THIS GREAT OUTRAGE MY BROTHER HURRIED ON TO NORRISTOWN AND WAITED HIS ARRIVAL WITH A PROCESS TO ARREST HIM
OWING TO A LATE AFFLICTION IN HIS FAMILY COMPELLING HIM TO DEVOTE THE MOST OF HIS TIME THERETO IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN FROM HIM THE MATERIAL FOR COMPLETING SUCH A SKETCH AS WAS DESIRED
DURING THE PAST SUMMER WHEN IT WAS TOO WARM TO LABOR IN THE SOUTH SHE SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN THIS FIELD WITHOUT A FARTHING'S REWARD
MY WIFES NAME IS WINNE ANN BERRELL AND SHE IS ONED BY ONE DR TARNS WHO IS ON A VISET TO BALTIMORE NOW MR STILL WILL YOU ATTEND TO THIS THING FOR ME FOURTHWITH IF YOU WILL I WILL PAY YOU FOUR YOUR TRUBLE IF WE CAN DOW ANY THING IT MUST BE DON NOW AS SHE WILL LEAVE THEARE IN THE SPRING AND IF YOU WILL TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND YOU MOUS WRIT ME ON TO RESEPTION OF THIS LETTER WHETHER YOU WILL OR NOT
BUT YOU SHALL NOT CROSS OUR LINE
HE SAID THAT MISS ELIZABETH GORDON A WHITE WOMAN LIVING IN ALEXANDRIA CLAIMED HIM
I THINK SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT SHE MEANT I SUPPOSE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
PHYSICALLY HE IS A GIANT

WHENEVER SHE COME TO YOUR CITY PLEASE GIVE INSTRUCTION HOW TO TRAVEL
THAT BALTIMORE WAS AS FAR NORTH AS I WISHED TO SEE AND THAT I HAD RATHER BE GOING HOME THAN GOING NORTH
HE WOULD BE THE FIRST SELECTED IN A CROWD BY A GENTLEMAN OR A LADY WHO MIGHT WANT A VERY NEAT-LOOKING MAN TO ATTEND TO HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS
IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING SINCE
HE WAS AIDED AND DIRECTED CANADA-WARD
THE INQUIRY MAY ARISE AS TO HOW SUCH PASSENGERS MANAGED TO GET THROUGH MARYLAND AND DELAWARE
NEW BEDFORD JUNE 23D 1855
INDEED IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THOUSANDS OF ANXIOUS WIVES HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION BY SLAVERY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO LEARN AS MUCH OF THEIR LOST ONES AS IS CONTAINED IN THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF HENRY STEWART

BESIDES HE FELT A LITTLE TIRED OF HAVING TO PAY TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR HIS HIRE AS HE HIRED HIS TIME OF HIS MASTER
HAVE TOLD ME THAT SHE GIVEN SOME DIRECTIONS HOW HE COULD BE GOTEN AT BUT FRIEND STILL IF THIS CONDUCTOR SHOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULL THIS TIME WILL YOU MIND HIM OF THE POOR SLAVE AGAIN
9TH 1856
BELIEVING THAT THE PURCHASE OF SUCH ARTICLES BY FURNISHING TO THE MASTER THE ONLY POSSIBILITY OF PECUNIARY PROFIT FROM THE LABOR OF HIS SLAVES SUPPLIED ONE MOTIVE FOR HOLDING THEM IN BONDAGE AND THAT THE PURCHASER THUS BECAME HOWEVER UNWITTINGLY A PARTAKER IN THE GUILT HE FELT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BOUND TO WITHHOLD HIS INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE AND TO RECOMMEND THE SAME COURSE TO OTHERS
WHICH REWARD SHALL BE DIVIDED EQUALLY AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE PATROL RETAKING THE SLAVE AND ACTUALLY ON DUTY AT THE TIME
IN HOW MANY CASES THE PERSONS STOLEN ARE LEGALLY LIABLE TO CAPTURE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STATE
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE MIXED BLOOD INTELLIGENT AND A BRAVE FELLOW AS WILL APPEAR PRESENTLY
BUT REFLECTION CONVINCED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY RIGHT TO ASSIST MEN IN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THEIR LIBERTY WHEN UNJUSTLY HELD IN BONDAGE BUT A DUTY
THE VERY SAME DAY THAT I RECEIVED THE ABOVE MENTIONED LETTER AND WHILE OUR HEARTS WERE STILL ACHING OVER ITS CONTENTS ANOTHER WAS BROUGHT US FROM THOMAS GARRETT OF WILMINGTON DELAWARE ANNOUNCING THE ABDUCTION A NIGHT OR TWO BEFORE OF A FREE COLORED MAN OF THAT CITY
NOTHING BUT AN ARDENT LOVE OF LIBERTY PROMPTED HIM TO ESCAPE
HIS PHYSICAL OUTLINES GAVE HIM A COMMANDING APPEARANCE FOR ONE WHO HAD WORN THE YOKE AS HE HAD FOR SO MANY YEARS
ALTHOUGH SHE SUFFERED SO SEVERELY AS THE RESULT OF HER RESOLUTION TO THROW OFF THE YOKE SHE HAD NO REGRETS AT LEAVING THE PRISON-HOUSE
AS SOON AS THEY CAME WILLIAM WRIGHT WENT TO THE STORE AND GOT FOUR PAIR OF SHOES
SHE FIRST COMMENCED HER BONDAGE IN RICHMOND UNDER THE LATE BENJAMIN HILLIARD OF WHOM SHE SAID THAT HE WAS A VERY BAD MAN WHO COULD NEVER BE PLEASED BY A SERVANT AND WAS CONSTANTLY ADDICTED TO FIGHTING NOT ONLY WITH OTHERS BUT ALSO WITH HERSELF
ROBERT BROWN ALIAS THOMAS JONES
ROBERT BROWN ALIAS THOMAS JONES
IN THIS CRITICAL HOUR IT DEVOLVED UPON A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL PARTIES TO FIND NEW AND SEPARATE PLACES OF ACCOMMODATION ESPECIALLY FOR THE SIX KNOWN TO BE PURSUED
THEIR MASTER IS HERE WITH THEM ON HIS WAY TO NEW YORK THE NOTE WAS WITHOUT DATE AND THE SIGNATURE SO INDISTINCTLY WRITTEN AS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY ME HAVING EVIDENTLY BEEN PENNED IN A MOMENT OF HASTE
BEING OF AN INDUSTRIOUS TURN SHE FOUND A SITUATION IMMEDIATELY AND FROM THAT DAY TO THE PRESENT SHE HAS SUSTAINED AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER IN EVERY RESPECT AND AS A FASHIONABLE DRESSMAKER DOES A GOOD BUSINESS
THEY ARE HIS PROPERTY THE YOUNGEST BOY ABOUT 7 YEARS OF AGE--TOO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS MEANT--CRIED MASSA JOHN
IT DOES GOOD
THROUGH HIS AGENCY MANY FOUND THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM BOTH BY LAND AND WATER
BIRNEY
NOR IN THE TRESPASS CASE DID THE JURY GIVE LARGER DAMAGES THAN WERE CLAIMED A JURY SOMETIMES DOES QUEER THINGS BUT IT CANNOT MAKE A VERDICT FOR A GREATER SUM THAN THE PLAINTIFF DEMANDS
HE SAID THAT HE CAME FROM RICHMOND AND LEFT BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING SOLD BY JOHN A
HE RESOLVED TO TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THAT MIGHT PASS THAT WAY
I MENTION THIS SO THAT THEE MAY KNOW
DEAR SIR.--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM WELL AT PRESENT AND HOPE THAT THESE FEW LINES MAY FIND YOU INJOYING THE SAME BLESSING I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME NOW BUT HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO YOU BEFORE BUT YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
MR PARLANGE IMMEDIATELY MADE APPLICATION TO A MR WALLACE WHO IS A POLICE OFFICER STATIONED AT THE WALNUT STREET DEPOT
CAPTAINS AND CAPTIVES IN ORDER TO SUCCEED FOUND THAT IT REQUIRED MORE THAN ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE AND COURAGE SHREWDNESS AND DETERMINATION AND AT THE SAME TIME A VERY ARDENT APPRECIATION OF LIBERTY WITHOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE NO SUCCESS
PLEASE GIVE MY WIFE AND CHILD'S NAME TO DR LUNDY AND TELL HIM TO ATTEND TO IT FOR ME
WORKED HARD IN ALL SORTS OF WEATHER--IN RAIN AND SNOW SO HE THOUGHT HE WOULD GO WHERE COLORED MEN ARE FREE HIS MASTER WAS CONSIDERED THE HARDEST MAN AROUND
J.K
EIGHT ARRIVALS
EIGHT ARRIVALS
MARIA THE HEROINE OF THE PARTY WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE CHESTNUT COLOR MEDIUM SIZE AND POSSESSED OF A GOOD SHARE OF COMMON SENSE
NO FURTHER RECORD OF JACKSON WAS MADE
WITH A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE AND HUMANITY HE COULD NOT FAIL TO SHARE IN THE TRADITIONAL OPPOSITION OF HIS RELIGIOUS SOCIETY TO SLAVERY AND TO BE QUICKENED TO MORE INTENSE FEELING AS THE EVILS OF THE SYSTEM WERE MORE FULLY REVEALED IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY AGITATION WHICH IN HIS EARLY MANHOOD BEGAN TO STIR THE NATION
BUT HIS ROUTE LAY IN A FAR DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN THAT CONTEMPLATED BY THE GOVERNOR AND HIS LADY
SAM SAID HE LEFT BECAUSE HIS MASTER THREATENED TO SELL HIM TO GEORGIA AND HE BELIEVED THAT HE MEANT SO TO DO AS HE HAD SOLD ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO GEORGIA SOME TIME BEFORE HE ESCAPED

THE STEAMER WAS FIVE DAYS COMING
IT IS FURTHER STATED THAT ONE OF THE TWO MAGISTRATES BY WHOM W.S

FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS HE TOOK THEM TO A TEMPORARY RESTING-PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TARRY UNTIL AFTER DARK
HUNTED AND BRANDED AND A PREY OUR WATCH AMIDST THE DARKNESS KEEPING
FOR A WEEK HE WAS TRYING TO REACH FREE SOIL THE RAIN SCARCELY CEASING FOR AN HOUR
FROM MR MCKIM TO GEORGE THOMPSON 1851
BEING ANXIOUS TO GET HIS TESTIMONY RELATIVE TO HIS ESCAPE ETC THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TOOK HIS PENCIL AND EXPRESSED TO HIM HIS WISHES IN THE MATTER
WHETHER HE DESERVED IT OR NOT ALFRED GAVE HIM A BAD CHARACTER AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO THE TREATMENT OF HIS SLAVES
FOUR ABLE-BODIED MEN FORM THE SUBJECT OF THE SUBJOINED CORRESPONDENCE
GARNETT'S WIFE
OR HOW CAN I COUNT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED TO ME IN THE LIGHT OF A SACRIFICE
THE HOLY RESOLVES WHICH ANIMATED THEM AND MADE THE TIME HOURS OF EXALTATION NOW SERVE TO BRIGHTEN THE PATHWAY OF HIS DECLINING YEARS AND TO THROW A HALO AROUND THE RESTFULNESS OF HIS HOME AS IN PEACE OF MIND HE LOOKS ABROAD OVER HIS BELOVED COUNTRY TO SEE MILLIONS OF ENFRANCHISED MEN BEGINNING TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF ITS PECUNIARY EDUCATIONAL AND POLITICAL ADVANTAGES AND BEHOLDS THEM STARTING ON A CAREER OF MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL PROSPERITY WITH A RAPIDITY COMMENSURATE WITH THE EXPANSIVE FORCE OF THE REPRESSED ENERGIES OF A RACE
STEWART SUSAN 508
THEY RECOGNIZE NO HIGHER APPEAL THAN TO THE TRIBUNALS IT HAS APPOINTED
THUS CORDELIA'S EXPERIENCE THOUGH CHIEFLY CONFINED TO THE GREAT HOUSE EXTENDED OCCASIONALLY OVER THE CORN AND TOBACCO FIELDS AMONG THE OVERSEERS AND FIELD HANDS GENERALLY
HERE THE PROSPECT BEGAN TO BRIGHTEN
THE PAPERS ALLUDED TO HAD NO REFERENCE TO MYSELF
MANY HAD EVIDENTLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE AMUSING TO SEE THE COWHIDING THAN THE CIRCUS
WHY FULLER REPORTS WERE NOT WRITTEN OUT CANNOT NOW BE ACCOUNTED FOR
IN MANY OF THESE CASES PHYSICAL COURAGE WAS NEEDED AS MUCH AS MORAL FIRMNESS
HE CHARGED DR JOSIAH HARDING OF ROCKVILLE MONTGOMERY COUNTY WITH HAVING ENSLAVED HIM CONTRARY TO HIS WISH OR WILL
CALLED ON THE COLONEL AND INVITED HIM TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STATION
A STRONG FACE WITH A SHADOWED GLOW UPON IT INDICATIVE OF THOUGHTFUL FERVOR AND OF A NATURE MOST FEMININELY SENSITIVE BUT NOT IN THE LEAST MORBID
I HAVE READ SOMEWHERE IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT OF A HINDOO BEING LOTH TO CUT A TREE BECAUSE BEING A BELIEVER IN THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS HE THOUGHT THE SOUL OF HIS FATHER HAD PASSED INTO IT
THE SON AND DAUGHTER WERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE

JOHN WAS A MULATTO OF GENTEEL ADDRESS WELL CLOTHED AND LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN WELL FED MISS ELIZA LAMBERT HAD THE HONOR OF OWNING JOHN AND WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO HIRE HIS TIME FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS PER ANNUM
ROBERT REGARDED HER AS A VERY HARD MISTRESS UNTIL THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND WHICH TOOK PLACE THE FALL PREVIOUS TO HIS ESCAPE
JAMES WAS ANOTHER ASSOCIATE PASSENGER AND THE BEST-LOOKING ARTICLE IN THE PARTY
RHOADS GEO 143
WHAT WAS CALLED MODERN ABOLITIONISM AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LESS AGGRESSIVE FORM OF OPPOSITION TO SLAVERY WHICH PRECEDED THE MOVEMENT PIONEERED BY GARRISON THEY AT ONCE ACCEPTED AS SOON AS IT WAS SET BEFORE THEM THROUGH THE AGENTS OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY IN THE CAMPAIGN IN PENNSYLVANIA BEGUN IN 1836
I COULD SEE NO ENJOYMENT THAT WAY AS THE SECRET OF HIS MASTER'S TREATMENT IS HERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT CHARLES IN SPEAKING SO HIGHLY IN HIS FAVOR FAILED TO TAKE A JUST VIEW OF HIM AS NO MAN COULD REALLY BE FIRST-RATE TO HIS SERVANTS WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW A MAN TO LIVE WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND WHO WOULD PERSIST IN TAKING FROM ANOTHER WHAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE
COLOR BLACK
SHE AND HER HUSBAND SET OUT TOGETHER WITH SIX OTHERS AND WERE OF THE PARTY OF EIGHT WHO WERE BETRAYED INTO DOVER JAIL AS HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED IN THESE PAGES
HURBERD WHO CAME FROM VIRGINIA WITH ME IS GOING TO GET MARRIED THE 20TH OF NOVEMBER NEXT

BUT HER SAVAGE TORMENTORS BEAT HER ALMOST TO DEATH
DR ISAAC WINSLOW OF ALEXANDRIA WAS ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING LAWRENCE OF HIS HIRE
HE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY BUT NOT MUCH CHARACTER
MOTHER AND CHILD FROM NORFOLK VA ETC
THE LOSS OF THIS PARTY LIKEWISE FALLS ON MARYLAND
HE COULD THINK OF THEM BUT THAT WAS ALL
BUT BEFORE THE STEAMER HAD MADE HALF HER DISTANCE THE STORM WAS TOSSING THE SHIP HITHER AND THITHER FEARFULLY
A TELEGRAPH DESPATCH HAS BEEN SENT TO PHILADELPHIA AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO RESCUE THE PARTIES WHEN THE CARS ARRIVE
NO COUNSEL APPEARED FOR THE FUGITIVES
SOME TO WHOM I MINISTER I KNOW WILL CALL IT A POLITICAL SPEECH
THIS PASSENGER AVAILS HIMSELF OF HOLIDAY WEEK BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S TO MAKE HIS NORTHERN TRIP
IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT BOTH THESE FRIENDS WROTE FROM WASHINGTON D.C THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WHERE IF SLAVERY WAS NOT SEEN IN ITS WORST ASPECTS THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS SUPPORT OF SLAVERY APPEARED IN A MOST REVOLTING LIGHT
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF ANXIETY EXISTED IN PHILADELPHIA RESPECTING THE SAFETY OF THE MERCHANDISE
WITHAL HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AT PERRYVILLE MARYLAND
FROM RICHMOND--"FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD OFFERED BY R.J
HIS FARE HAD TO BE PAID BY A FRIEND THERE THE TREASURER OF THE FUND BEING ABSENT
FORTUNATELY HE WAS FREE BUT SLAVERY HAD MANY WAYS OF PUTTING THE YOKE ON THE COLORED MAN EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE FREE
SPENT A SHORT WHILE IN PHILADELPHIA IN ORDER TO RECRUIT AFTER WHICH HE WENT ON NORTH WHERE COLORED MEN WERE FREE
THE PALACE OWED HIM NO MORE THAN THE HOVEL SUGGESTED THOUGHTS OF SUPERIORITY
SOME HAVE BEEN SOLD TO ALABAMA AND SOME TO TENNESSEE THE REST ARE HELD IN RICHMOND
ON MONDAY AFTERNOON A DAY-SCHOOL
ON HIS MARRIAGE TO A WHITE WOMAN HE SENT HIS FIVE COLORED CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHER TO AUCTION TO BE SOLD FOR CASH TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
WITH MUCH MORE INTELLIGENCE THAN WOULD BE SUPPOSED FROM FIRST OBSERVATION
TOPSHAM VT APRIL 3D 1858
SINCE THEN SHE HAS GIVEN MUCH OF HER TIME TO THE FEMALE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT AND SO LATE AS NOVEMBER 1871 SHE TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA PEACE SOCIETY
IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY AGREEABLE TO HEAR EVEN THE LITTLE CHILDREN TESTIFY THAT IN THE MOST TRYING HOUR ON THE ROAD NOT FOR A MOMENT DID THEY WANT TO GO BACK
FOR A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE SETTING OUT FOR FREEDOM ROBERT HAD WATCHED HIS MASTER PRETTY CLOSELY AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WAS A MONSTROUS BLUSTERY KIND OF A MAN

SHE SPOKE OF A MAN NAMED GEORGE FORD AS HER OWNER
IN SUCH A CRISIS HE EVIDENTLY FELT THAT PREACHING WOULD DO NO GOOD
HIS WIFE AND CHILD HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND
I WISH YOU MAY EXCUSE THIS LETTER FOR I AM SO FULL THAT I CANNOT EXPRESS MY MIND AT ALL
THOSE PERSONS THAT YOU SHIPPED A FEW WEEKS AGO REMAINED AT ST CATHERINE INSTEAD OF COMING OVER TO TORONTO
INSTEAD OF BEING OVERDRAWN NOT HALF OF THE PARTICULARS WERE RECORDED
THE INDUSTRIOUS AARON NOT ONLY HAD TO PAY HIS OWN HIRE BUT WAS OBLIGED TO DO ENOUGH OVER-WORK TO SUPPORT HIS LARGE FAMILY
AND NOW I WILL TELL YOU MY REASONS FOR GOING TO CALIFORNIA
THE NARRATIVES ARE EMBODIED IN PLAIN LANGUAGE
AND I THINK WOULD HESITATE MORE TO DO A BAD ACT IN THE PRESENCE OF OBSERVERS
THIS WE THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE COMPLAINED OF BY ANY WHO WERE SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO LOSE WAYWARD SERVANTS AS IT IS BUT FAIR TO GIVE CREDIT TO ALL CONCERNED
AFTER REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WROTE BACK TO KNOW HOW HIS FRIEND AND COMPANION GEORGE WAS GETTING ALONG
SHE WAS AN OLD WOMAN AND BELONGED TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
PEARSON WAS ALSO SENT FOR AND CAME--THE SAME JOHN H
HE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE HAD BOTH DEPARTED BUT TWO OF THE DAUGHTERS YOUNG LADIES STILL LIVED
YOU MAY NOW ASK BY WHAT MEANS WE HOPE TO ATTAIN THEM
WHETHER THE SORROW-STRICKEN WIFE EVER AFTERWARDS HEARD OF HER HUSBAND OR THE FATHER OF HIS TWO LITTLE CHILDREN THE WRITER IS UNABLE TO SAY
ELIJAH BISHOP AND WILLIAM WILLIAMSON
RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--I WRITE TO LET THEE KNOW THAT HARRIET TUBMAN IS AGAIN IN THESE PARTS
IT WAS CHARACTER LIVING ITSELF OUT AN UTTERANCE OF ITS ENTIRE UNITY SOMETHING DRAWN FROM THE SOLEMN DEPTHS OF THOSE LIFE-CONVICTIONS WHICH ALL THE PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL POWERS OF A MAN AGLOW AND WELDED UNITE IN PRODUCING
HE CALLED THE WORTHY JUDGE FROM HIS BED OFFERING THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS BUSINESS AND THE NECESSITY OF SPEEDY ACTION AS AN APOLOGY FOR SO UNSEASONABLE A VISIT
IF HE HAD FELT THAT THE ACT WAS WRONGFUL WOULD HE NOT HAVE APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF JUSTICE OF THE BRITISH BYSTANDERS WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO RESIST AN INSULT OFFERED TO A FOREIGNER IN THIS COUNTRY
THE BOX OF WHICH I HAD BEEN INQUIRING I HAVE RECEIVED AND AM INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR SENDING IT
THEY ACCORDINGLY REPAIRED TO BENEZET HALL ONE OF THEIR PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN SOUTH SEVENTH STREET WITH A SUPPLY OF FIRE ARMS AND AMMUNITION DETERMINED TO FIRE UPON THE ASSAILANTS AND MAINTAIN THEIR POST OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT
ALSO THE NOBLE-HEARTED SMITH WHO BOXED HIM UP WAS MADE TO REJOICE OVER BROWN'S VICTORY AND WAS THEREBY ENCOURAGED TO RENDER SIMILAR SERVICE TO TWO OTHER YOUNG BONDMEN WHO APPEALED TO HIM FOR DELIVERANCE
DURING HER STAY IN PHILADELPHIA SHE PUBLISHED SOME VERSES ENTITLED ELIZA HARRIS CROSSING THE RIVER ON THE ICE IT WAS DEEMED BEST TO DELAY THE ISSUING OF THE BOOK
HE AND HIS SISTER OWN WELL ON TO ONE HUNDRED HEAD THOUGH WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS HE HAS BEEN THINNING OFF THE NUMBER BY SALE
MY MASTER SAID JACOB WAS A FARMER A VERY ROUGH MAN HARD TO SATISFY
WHICH KEEPSAKES HAVE BEEN VALUED VERY HIGHLY
PASCAL FLED FROM VIRGINIA AND ACCUSED BANNON AND BRADY OF DOING VIOLENCE TO HIS LIBERTY
SIR--WE ARRIVED HERE SAFELY
CHARLES WAS SORRY FOR THE FATE OF HIS SISTERS BUT HE COULD NOT HELP THEM IF HE REMAINED
WITH KIND REGARDS THY FRIEND A
HIGH-TONED IN MORAL NATURE KEENLY SENSITIVE IN ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO JUSTICE AND INTEGRITY HE WAS A MOST VALUABLE COADJUTOR WITH THE LEADERS OF AN UNPOPULAR REFORM
NOBLE GIRL
FIVE TIMES HE HAD PROPOSED TO BUY HIMSELF BUT FAILED TO GET THE CONSENT OF HIS MASTER WHO WAS A MERCHANT C.C

HENRY 493
I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU BEFORE THIS BUT I PUT AWAY THE CARD YOU GAVE ME AND COULD NOT FIND IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS SINS I DID NOT GO TO CANADA FOR I GOT WORK IN OSWEGO BUT TIMES ARE VERY DULL HERE AT PRESENT
WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND YORK
IN SLAVERY HE LEFT HIS MOTHER AND THREE SISTERS OWNED BY THE OLD WOMAN FROM WHOM HE ESCAPED
STATION MASTERS ON THE ROAD
IN ESCAPING THEY HAD TO BREAK JAIL IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WHILE ALL WERE ASLEEP IN THE BIG HOUSE
BUT UNDER THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS INSTEAD OF THE LASH SHE SAW SCHOOL BOOKS AND OVER THE RUINS OF SLAVERY EDUCATION AND FREE SPEECH SPRINGING UP AT WHICH SHE WAS MOVED TO EXCLAIM THANK GOD FOR THE WONDERFUL CHANGE
HE INFERRED HE WOULD FIND HER AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE WENT
WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING GOOD SENSE,--NOT ENOUGH TO MANAGE THE GREAT AMOUNT OF PROPERTY HE HAD BEEN LEFT WEALTHY IN HIS POSSESSION AARON'S SERVITUDE COMMENCED UNDER THIS SPIRITUAL PROTECTOR IN MAY PRIOR TO THE ESCAPE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS OLD MASTER
ALTHOUGH I HATE SLAVERY SO MUCH I KEEP MY HANDS CLEAR OF ANY SUCH WICKED OR ILLEGAL ACT YOURS VERY TRULY J.B
BUT FEW TRANSCEND THAT AUCTION-BLOCK WHERE THE SHERIFF WAS SELLING ALL GARRETT'S GOODS FOR THE CRIME OF GIVING A BREAKFAST TO A FAMILY OF FUGITIVE SLAVES
I KNOW AT ANY RATE NO BETTER WORK FOR ME DURING THE BRIEF PERIOD I AM TO STAY ON THE EARTH THAN IS FOUND IN PLEADING THE CAUSE OF THE DOWN-TRODDEN AND THE DUMB
THE ESCAPE OF A CHILD FOURTEEN MONTHS OLD
RAISED IN THE COUNTRY AND ON FARMS THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES HAD NEVER DREAMED OF ENCOURAGING THEM TO CONFORM TO HABITS OF CLEANLINESS
HIS TESTIMONY RAN SUBSTANTIALLY THUS
AFTER A FULL CONSULTATION WITH HER MOTHER AND ALSO HER INTENDED UPON THE MATTER SHE DECIDED THAT SHE MUST BE FREE IN ORDER TO FILL THE STATION OF A WIFE AND MOTHER
THE CORDS OF SLAVERY HAD BEEN TIGHTLY DRAWN AROUND THEM
AFTER SAFELY REACHING CANADA THE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE IN A LAND OF BONDAGE PRESSED SO DEEPLY UPON HIS MIND THAT HE WAS PROMPTED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO RESCUE HER
SHE TOLD NOT ONLY OF HIS ILL TREATMENT OF HER BUT DESCRIBED HIS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AS WELL
IT WAS OWING TO ABUSE OF THIS KIND THAT HE WAS AWAKENED TO LOOK FOR A RESIDENCE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE BRITISH LION
AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED THAT WHEN A PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR IN ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS HERETOFORE OR SHALL HEREAFTER ESCAPE INTO ANOTHER STATE OR TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES THE PERSON OR PERSONS TO WHOM SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR MAY BE DUE OR HIS HER OR THEIR AGENT OR ATTORNEY DULY AUTHORIZED BY POWER OF ATTORNEY IN WRITING ACKNOWLEDGED AND CERTIFIED UNDER THE SEAL OF SOME LEGAL OFFICE OR COURT OF THE STATE OR TERRITORY IN WHICH THE SAME MAY BE EXECUTED MAY PURSUE AND RECLAIM SUCH FUGITIVE PERSON EITHER BY PROCURING A WARRANT FROM SOME ONE OF THE COURTS JUDGES OR COMMISSIONERS AFORESAID OF THE PROPER CIRCUIT DISTRICT OR COUNTY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF SUCH FUGITIVE FROM SERVICE OR LABOR OR BY SEIZING AND ARRESTING SUCH FUGITIVE WHERE THE SAME CAN BE DONE WITHOUT PROCESS AND BY TAKING OR CAUSING SUCH PERSON TO BE TAKEN FORTHWITH BEFORE SUCH COURT JUDGE OR COMMISSIONER WHOSE DUTY IT SHALL BE TO HEAR AND DETERMINE THE CASE OF SUCH
THIS IN SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN THE INTERPRETATION GIVEN TO THESE WORDS BY THE ENGLISH JUDGES AND IT HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY AND FULLY RECOGNIZED AND ADOPTED IN THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
AFTER REMAINING A SHORT TIME IN PHILADELPHIA SHE MADE CHOICE OF BOSTON AS HER FUTURE RESIDENCE AND WITH A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON SHE PROCEEDED THITHERWARD
MY MANNER WHICH I SUPPOSED TO BE INDIFFERENT AND CALM BETRAYED ME AND SHE THREW HERSELF INTO MY ARMS SOBBING AND WEEPING
BE PLEASED TO REMEMBER ME TO FRIENDS AND ACCEPT YOURSELF THE BLESSING AND PRAYERS OF YOUR DEAR FRIEND EARRO WEEMS
BUT WE BELIEVE THE ACCOUNT WE GIVE BELOW AS THE RESULT OF THESE INQUIRIES IS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT
IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO GUNS WERE FIRED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SKIFF BUT HE HEEDED NOT THIS SIGNIFICANT CALL
AT PRESENT SHE OWNS ABOUT FIFTY SLAVES
HE READ RULES AND WAS NOT A LITTLE EMBARRASSED BY THESE POLITE AND WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MEN
BROTHERS AND SISTERS COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM WEEPING OVER THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR SEPARATION ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
OF COURSE I DO NOT PRETEND THAT ALL ARE SAVING MONEY OR GETTING HOMES
ATTEMPT TO SEDUCE HIM TO SLAVERY AGAIN
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THE PENNINGTONS ARE TAKEN
PASSING OVER MANY OF THE INTERESTING INCIDENTS ON THE ROAD SUFFICE IT TO SAY HE ARRIVED SAFELY IN THIS CITY ON NEW YEAR'S NIGHT 1857 ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE DAY BREAK THE TELEGRAPH HAVING ANNOUNCED HIS COMING FROM HARRISBURG HAVING BEEN A WEEK ON THE WAY
I LEFT THAT PLACE WENSDAY BUT I ONLY GOT FIVE MILES FROM THAT CITY THAT NIGHT
POLLY POOL WAS THEIR MISTRESS RATHER HAD OWNED THEM UP TO WITHIN A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE FLIGHT OF EVAN AND HIS COMRADES BUT SHE HAD LATELY BEEN UNFORTUNATE IN BUSINESS WHICH RESULTED IN A THOROUGH SCATTERING OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY
NO STATE IN THE UNION AS FAR AS COLORED PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED DO I LIKE BETTER--THE LAND OF WARM WELCOMES AND FRIENDLY HEARTS
HENRY COOPER AND WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH MIDDLETOWN DELAWARE
IN THE MIDST OF THE EXCITEMENT GEORGE CALLED IN TWO OFFICERS TO SETTLE THE TROUBLE
AMONG OTHER ITEMS OF INFORMATION WHICH CAME TO HIS EARS WAS A REPORT THAT HIS MASTER WAS BEING PRESSED BY HIS CREDITORS AND HAD ALL HIS SLAVES ADVERTISED FOR SALE
L.D
L.D
THEIR FIERCE PASSIONS WERE CALMED BY THE VOICE OF REASON AND ADMONITION
INDEED HE FELT THAT FOR A MAN TO PUT HIS HAND IN HIS NEIGHBOR'S POCKET AND ROB HIM WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE TAKING OF A MAN'S HARD EARNINGS FROM YEAR TO YEAR
THE HOUSE WAS OCCUPIED BY A SLAVE FAMILY FRIENDS OF WINNIE
THE TWO AGED WOMEN CHOSE TO BE ALONE IN THAT FEARFUL MOMENT SHUDDERING AT THE THOUGHT THAT A CORPSE MIGHT MEET THEIR GAZE INSTEAD OF A LIVING CREATURE
I MUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I SIR REMAIN HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT SERVANT J.H.H
FROM DICK'S STORY IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD SEEN HARD TIMES IN NORTH CAROLINA UNDER A MAN HE DESIGNATED BY THE NAME OF RICHARD SMALLWOOD
THE STRUGGLES OF THE PIONEER FATHERS ARE PRESERVED PRODUCED AND RE-PRODUCED AND CHERISHED WITH UNDYING INTEREST BY ALL AMERICANS AND THE DAY WILL NOT ARRIVE WHILE THE REPUBLIC EXISTS WHEN THESE HISTORIES WILL NOT BE FOUND IN EVERY LIBRARY
FROM HIS OWN STORY THERE WAS NO ESCAPING THE CONCLUSION THAT IF THE CHOICE HAD BEEN LEFT TO HIM HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED AT ANY TIME TO HAVE ENCOUNTERED AT THE MOUTH OF HIS CAVE A FEROCIOUS BEAR THAN HIS MASTER THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA
THAT I HAVE BEEN HIGHLY FAVORED WITH FRIENDS THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY I WISH MY WIFE TO WRITE TO ME AS SOON AS SHE CAN AND LET ME KNOW HOW SOON I MAY EXPECT TO SEE HER ON THIS SIDE OF THE NIAGARA RIVER
WHEN MORE ANTI-SLAVERY SPEECHES WERE MADE TRACTS PAPERS AND BOOKS WERE WRITTEN PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTED
HE HARDLY ALLOWED THEM TO TALK--WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO RAISE CHICKENS AND ONLY ALLOWED MARY THREE DRESSES A YEAR THE REST SHE HAD TO GET AS SHE COULD
JOE IS ABOUT 30 YEARS OLD VERY BLACK HIS TEETH ARE VERY WHITE AND IS ABOUT FIVE FEET EIGHT INCHES HIGH
HE LEFT ONE CHILD JANE OLIVER OWNED BY MRS MARSHALL
WHY THIS IS THE CASE CANNOT NOW BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNLESS THE HURRY OF GETTING HIM OFF FORBADE SUFFICIENT DELAY TO NOTE DOWN MORE OF THE PARTICULARS
HE FLED TO KEEP FROM BEING SOLD
MCCOY ROBT ALIAS WM
AND I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT A POOR WORKING-MAN AND HIS FAMILY HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF CALLING THE ATTENTION OF MEN OF LETTERS TO ASSIST IN RAISING FROM THE DUST A CRUSHED RACE OF MEN
HE ASSURED THE COMMITTEE THAT HE HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY SLAVERY FROM HIS BIRTH AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE THEREOF HE HAD SUFFERED SERIOUS HARDSHIPS
A REPORT FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE PAPERS TO THE EFFECT THAT MILLER THE WHITE MAN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE FAMILY WAS FOUND DROWNED WITH HIS HANDS AND FEET IN CHAINS AND HIS SKULL FRACTURED
THE ABOVE REWARD WILL BE PAID IF DELIVERED IN WASHINGTON CITY
NOTHING LIKE SUNDAY RAIMENT WAS EVER GIVEN THEM
WHAT THIS HEROIC MAN ENDURED FROM SEVERE STRUGGLES AND UNYIELDING EXERTIONS IN TRAVELING THOUSANDS OF MILES ON WATER AND ON FOOT HUNGRY AND FATIGUED ROWING HIS LIVING FREIGHT FOR SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS IN A SKIFF IS HARDLY TO BE PARALLELED IN THE ANNALS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD

AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW IN 1851 HIS DUTIES IN THIS RESPECT WERE ARDUOUS AND VARIOUS AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM ONE OF HIS PRIVATE LETTERS TO AN ENGLISH FRIEND WHICH FOUND ITS WAY INTO PRINT ABROAD AND WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN ANOTHER PLACE
NOT ONLY WAS IT DOMINANT IN THE SOUTHERN STATES BUT EVEN IN THE FREE STATES IT HAD BOWED THE CONSTITUENCIES SOCIETY AND IN TOO MANY INSTANCES EVEN THE CHURCHES TO ITS WILL
INSTEAD OF LANDING HIS PASSENGERS IN PHILADELPHIA AS WAS HIS INTENTION FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THE SCHOONER MAY HAVE BEEN DISABLED HE LANDED THEM ON THE NEW JERSEY COAST NOT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM CAPE ISLAND
GARRETT LUCY ALIAS JULIA WOOD 223
IN FACT HE HATED THE VERY NAME OF SLAVEHOLDER THE LIMIT OF THE BOX NOT ADMITTING OF STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF OUT HE WAS TAKEN WITH THE CRAMP ON THE ROAD SUFFERED INDESCRIBABLE MISERY AND HAD HIS FAITH TAXED TO THE UTMOST,--INDEED WAS BROUGHT TO THE VERY VERGE OF SCREAMING ALOUD ERE RELIEF CAME
SHE IS WAS THE ANSWER

HE FULFILLED HIS PROMISE AND BROUGHT HER THAT NIGHT TO MY HOUSE WHICH WAS IN SIGHT OF THE ONE WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO NEW CASTLE JAIL

WHAT MADE ME LEAVE WAS BECAUSE I WORKED FOR HIM ALL MY LIFE-TIME AND HE NEVER GAVE ME BUT TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS IN ALL HIS LIFE
OH HOW SWEET THE WORD DO SOUND TO ME YEAS WHEN I CONTEMPLATE OF THESE THINGS MY VERY FLESH CREAPS MY HEART THRUB WHEN I THINK OF MY BELOVED FRIENDS WHOM I LEFT IN THAT CURSID HOLE
HE SAID HE WANTED ME TO COME ON HERE AND HE DID NOT WANT ME TO TELL ANY PERSON BEFORE WE LEFT OUR COUNTY
NEVERTHELESS AS HE HAD BEEN A SLAVE ALL HIS DAYS HE FOUND THAT IT REQUIRED NO SMALL AMOUNT OF NERVE TO SUCCEED IN RUNNING THE GAUNTLET WITH SLAVE-HOLDERS AND SLAVE-CATCHERS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY
STILL--IT DOES ME PLEASURE TO FORWARD YOU THIS LETTER HOPEING WHEN THIS COMES TO HAND IT MAY FIND YOUR FAMILY WELL AS THEY LEAVES ME AT PRESENT

THE JUSTICE OF THE WAR ON THE PART OF THE NORTH AND ITS EFFECT ON THE FATE OF SLAVERY AT THE SOUTH WERE NEVER SUBJECTS OF DOUBT IN THE MIND OF MR GARRISON AND HE QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE FORCE OF EVENTS WHICH HAD TAKEN FROM THE ABOLITIONISTS THE HELM OF DIRECTION AND REUNITED THEM WITH THEIR COUNTRYMEN IN THE IRRESISTIBLE FLOOD WHICH NO MAN'S HAND GUIDED AND NO MAN'S HAND COULD STAY

IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THIS SKETCH IT IS ONLY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD COPY THE BEAUTIFUL AND JUST TRIBUTE TO HER MEMORY WRITTEN BY OLIVER JOHNSON EDITOR OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND PUBLISHED IN THE COLUMNS THEREOF AS FOLLOWS
BEFORE THIS HE HAD KEPT IN THE FIELDS AND FORESTS BUT NOW FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO COME OUT UPON THE ROAD
WHIPPER
THE DINNER FOR THE WHITE PRISONERS MESSRS
THIS OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE IN PETERSBURG VA ABOUT THE FIRST OF DECEMBER 1854
HIS WIFE HAD BEEN DIFFERENTLY TREATED NOT BEING UNDER THE SAME TASKMASTER AS HER HUSBAND
I DO NOT THINK OF GOING TO CANADA NOW
HE AS EARNESTLY DEVISED THE MEANS AS CALMLY COUNTED THE COST AND AS UNSHRINKINGLY TURNED HIM TO THE TASK AS IF IT WERE HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE WON
SHE HAD BEEN OWNED BY A WIDOW WOMAN NAMED LEWIS BUT AS LATELY AS THE PREVIOUS MARCH HER MISTRESS DIED LEAVING HER SLAVES AND OTHER PROPERTY TO BE DIVIDED AMONG HER HEIRS
WHILE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FLEEING WERE PENDING HE BROKE THE SECRET TO HIS WIFE POLLY IN WHOM HE TRUSTED
NOT FORGETTING WHICH WAY TO STEER ACROSS THE BAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHTHOUSE THEY ROWED FOR THAT POINT WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED BUT THEIR BARK BEING LIGHT AND THE WIND AND ROUGH WATER BY NO MEANS MANAGEABLE ERE THEY REACHED THE DESIRED SHORE THEY WERE CARRIED A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OFF THEIR COURSE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A SMALL ISLAND
IT IS BUT JUST TO STATE IN FAVOR OF HIS MASTER THAT WILLIAM WAS HIMSELF THE RECEIVER OF A PART OF THE PAY FOR THIS NIGHT WORK
PHILLIS WAS TO USE HER OWN STRIKING EXPRESSION IN A STATE OF GREAT HORROR SHE FELT THAT NOTHING WOULD RELIEVE HER BUT FREEDOM
HERE IS A WOMAN WHO WITH HER HUSBAND AT THE SURRENDER HAD A SINGLE DOLLAR
ACCORDING TO LAW HE WAS ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE
WHAT BUSINESS DID MILTON HAWKINS FOLLOW AGAIN QUERIED SAID MEMBER
CONSEQUENTLY HE LEFT BECAUSE HIS MASTER DID NOT TREAT HIM RIGHT WEBSTER WAS A TALL MAN WITH LARGE BLACK WHISKERS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE AND OWNED CHARLES TWO SISTERS

THE YEAR BEFORE SHE RAN AWAY I PROFESSED RELIGION
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER ANN STUBBS AND HALF BROTHER ISAIAH AND TRAVELED AS A WHITE MAN
FITCHHUGH UP TO WITHIN A SHORT TIME BEFORE HE ESCAPED
THE LOVE OF FREEDOM IN THE BREAST OF THIS SPIRITED YOUNG SLAVE-WIFE AND MOTHER DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE LOVE SHE BORE TO HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN HOWEVER OTHERWISE HER COURSE IN LEAVING THEM AS SHE DID MIGHT APPEAR
IT IS AN EXTRACT FROM A SERMON DELIVERED ON THE 29TH OF MAY 1854 A PERIOD WHEN THE SLAVE OLIGARCHY WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF ITS POWER AND WAS SUPPORTED AT THE NORTH BY THE MOST VIOLENT DEMONSTRATIONS OF SYMPATHY
SAMUEL AND CATHARINE WERE THE NAMES OF HIS PARENTS
AT THIS SIGN OF RESISTANCE ONE OF THE WHITE MEN WITH AN OAR STRUCK THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE FUGITIVES WHICH KNOCKED HIM DOWN
IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS SO BAD WE ALL HAD TO LEAVE C

SILAS AND SOLOMON BOTH LEFT TOGETHER FROM CAMBRIDGE MD
THIS DONE THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO JOE DRIVE ON JOE BRAVELY OBEYED
BUT HUNN WAS TOO PLUCKY TO BE FRIGHTENED BY THEIR THREATS AND MENACES AND AS ONE COMMISSIONED BY A HIGHER POWER TO REMEMBER THOSE IN BONDS AS BOUND WITH THEM HE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO THE SLAVE
ABOLITIONISTS WERE THEN INTENSELY IN EARNEST AND DETERMINED NEVER TO HOLD THEIR PEACE OR CEASE THEIR WARFARE UNTIL IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL EMANCIPATION WAS ACHIEVED
I HEARD MRS LUNDY WAS DEAD AND THOUGHT THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE REASON HE HAD NOT REPLIED TO ME
EBENEZER ALLISON
PROBABLY THE FEELING EXISTED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO WRITE OUT NARRATIVES EXCEPT IN CASES OF VERY SPECIAL INTEREST
FIRST TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THOSE WHO ARE ARRESTED AND WHO AS IS WELL KNOWN OFTEN SUFFER GREATLY FROM WANT OF HONEST AND INTELLIGENT COUNSEL
PLEASE DIRECT YOUR ANSWER WITH ALL NECESSARY DIRECTIONS TO N
MISTRESS WAS A LARGE PORTLY WOMAN GOOD-LOOKING AND PRETTY WELL LIKED BY HER SLAVES
IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL MEANS OF GRACE AND SALVATION APPOINTED IN THE PROVIDENCE OF HEAVEN FOR THE PRESENT DAY AND GENERATION MORE RELIGIOUS THAN CHURCHES AND SABBATHS
EMBARKED DIRECT FOR THE OTHER SHORE
HE WILL LEAVE HERE TO-MORROW BUT DON'T SAY THAT HE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE CITY
BUT FOR HIS STRONG ATTACHMENT TO HIS WIFE WHO WAS OWNED BY SAMUEL ADAMS BUT WAS PRETTY WELL TREATED HE NEVER WOULD HAVE CONSENTED TO SUFFER AS HE DID

STILL WISHES SOME ACCOUNT OF THE CASE OF THE NEGRO SLAVE TAKEN FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SOME YEARS AGO AFTER AN ATTEMPT BY MY BROTHER GEORGE TO RELEASE HIM
BEHOLD THAT GREAT MULTITUDE MORE THAN THREE MILLIONS OF MEN AND FEEBLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WANDERING ON OUR SOIL
THE MAN WITH THE ASHES IMMEDIATELY APPEARED AND SIGNALLED HIM
I HAD COPIES OF SEVERAL PAPERS SENT ME WHEREIN I WAS DESCRIBED AS A MAN UNFIT TO LIVE IN A CIVILIZED COMMUNITY AND CALLING UPON THE INHABITANTS OF MIDDLETOWN TO EXPEL SUCH A DANGEROUS PERSON FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD

SOLOMON GEORGE ANTHONY JOSEPH EDWARD JAMES PERRY LAKE AND A NAMELESS BABE ALL VERY LIKELY
THIS FACT BECAME KNOWN TO THE LEADERS OF THE MOB AND THE CRY WAS RAISED TO MARCH FOR THE HALL AND MAKE THE ATTACK
AFTER SPENDING SOME THREE OR FOUR DAYS IN MRS MYERS FAMILY SHE REMAINED IN THE WRITER'S FAMILY ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME AND WAS THEN FORWARDED TO CANADA
SHE WAS FURNISHED WITH A FREE PASSAGE BY THE SAME LINE HER HUSBAND CAME IN

WILLIAM'S MANHOOD WAS AROUSED AND HE FLOGGED THE OVERSEER SOUNDLY IF WHAT HE AVERRED WAS TRUE
MILLER WHOSE LIFE WAS BASELY DESTROYED AND OTHER CITIZENS OF CHESTER COUNTY
OF MR MCCOY HOWEVER SHE SPOKE LESS SEVERELY THAN SHE DID OF HIS BETTER HALF INDEED SHE SPOKE OF SOME KIND TRAITS IN HIS CHARACTER BUT SAID THAT HIS WIFE WAS ONE OF THE TORN DOWN DEVILISH DISPOSITIONS ALL THE TIME QUARRELING AND FIGHTING AND WOULD SWEAR LIKE AN OLD SAILOR IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE EVIL PROPENSITIES THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS INTOLERABLE TO ROBERTA
HER BEARING WAS HUMBLE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE FACT THAT SHE EMERGED FROM THE LOWEST DEPTHS OF DELAWARE SLAVERY

IN HARRISBURG THEY HAD SOUGHT AND RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO FIND THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
WITH SINCERE PLEASURE I PROVIDED FOR THEM COMFORT QUARTERS TILL THIS MORNING WHEN THEY LEFT FOR TORONTO
ALTHOUGH A FATHER AND A HUSBAND HAVING A WIFE MARTHA AND TWO CHILDREN MARY ANN AND SUSAN JANE HE FELT THAT HIS LOT AS A SLAVE UTTERLY DEBARRED HIM FROM DISCHARGING HIS DUTY TO THEM
INDEED GEORGE DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY WITH EMPHASIS THAT HE NEITHER LIKED HIS OLD MASTER MISTRESS NOR ANY OF THE FAMILY
THE NEXT ARRIVAL IS RECORDED THUS
THE COARSE GARMENT ONCE ON WOULD BE CLUNG TO WITHOUT CHANGE AS LONG AS IT WOULD HOLD TOGETHER
HOW IS IT THAT ANY GREAT MATTER IS ACCOMPLISHED
ALSO WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM HIS BROTHER ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD,--HOW THAT MANY WHO COULD NOT GET THEIR FREEDOM IN ANY OTHER WAY BY BEING AIDED A LITTLE WERE DAILY ESCAPING TO CANADA
I HAVE NO CERTAIN RECOLLECTION OF THE YEAR HE DIED
AND THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE PASSENGERS BORE EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD BEEN USED TO SOMETHING BETTER THAN HERRING AND CORN CAKE FOR A DIET
SHE WAS EVER WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE HER TO HOPE FOR SAFETY WHEN ONCE THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE

THAT MR WILLIAMSON WAS DOING TEN-FOLD MORE IN PRISON FOR THE CAUSE OF UNIVERSAL LIBERTY THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO WHILE PURSUING HIS ORDINARY VOCATION
AS TIME PASSED ON THEIR HOME ALWAYS OPEN TO FUGITIVES BECAME AN IMPORTANT CENTRE OF UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD OPERATIONS FOR THE REGION EXTENDING FROM WILMINGTON DEL INTO ADAMS COUNTY PA
HIS PRINCIPLE WAS UNHESITATINGLY TO SUBMIT TO EXISTING LAWS HOWEVER UNJUST THEIR DECREES MIGHT BE BUT TO SCAN WELL THE BEARING OF THE FACTS AND PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN EACH CASE AND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS WANTING IN THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE OR IN THE LEGAL POINTS IN QUESTION FULLY TO SATISFY THE REQUISITIONS OF LAW
AND WELL HE MIGHT FOR HE HAD INDEED FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT AND BEEN FAITHFUL UNTO THE END
CANADA IS THE MEANEST PART OF THE GLOBE THAT I EVER FOUND OR HEARD OF;--DID NOT SEE BUT ONE BLACK OR COLORED PERSON IN CANADA,--INQUIRED AT THE CUSTOM-HOUSE TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF ALL THE BLACKS FROM THE SOUTH AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY SHIPPED THEM OFF OCCASIONALLY AND SENT THEM ROUND CAPE HORN AND SOLD THEM IN ADDITION TO THIS REPORT HE SAID THAT THE SUFFERING FROM DEEP SNOWS AND STARVATION WAS FEARFUL ALL OF WHICH HORATIO BELIEVED TO BE A LIE OF COURSE HE CONCEALED THIS OPINION FROM HIS MASTER
NOTHING MORE AT PRESENT I REMAIN YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT OSCAR D

SCHUYLKILL 11TH MO 29TH 1855
SOME SLAVES WHO HIRED THEIR TIME IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENT OF THEIR MONTHLY HIRE PURCHASED NICE CLOTHES FOR THEMSELVES WHICH THEY USUALLY VALUED HIGHLY SO MUCH SO THAT AFTER ESCAPING THEY WOULD NOT BE CONTENTED UNTIL THEY HAD TRIED EVERY POSSIBLE SCHEME TO SECURE THEM
INDEED IN THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE ELECTION HIS NAME WAS AMONGST THE ELECTED
THE HONOR AS WELL AS THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR WHOLE COUNTRY
IMPARTIAL MEN ARE THEY
HE AND ALL CONCERNED GIVE YOU AND THAT GENTLEMAN SINCERE THANKS FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
SLATER COACHMAKER OF PETERSBURG VIRGINIA IF HE IS STILL LIVING AND SHOULD SEE THESE ITEMS MAY SOLVE WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS A GREAT MYSTERY TO HIM--NAMELY THAT DAVID HIS MAN-SERVANT WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF IN PHILADELPHIA ABOUT THE FIRST WEEK IN JANUARY 1855 RECEIVING FREE ACCOMMODATIONS AND OBTAINING LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO FRIENDS IN CANADA
THEY AGREED IN GIVING HUTCHINS THE CHARACTER OF BEING A NOTORIOUS FROLICKER AND A VERY HARD MASTER UNDER HIM MATTERS WERE GROWING WORSE AND WORSE BEFORE THE OLD MASTER'S DEATH TIMES WERE MUCH BETTER
THEOPHILUS IS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE DARK HEIGHT AND STATURE HARDLY MEDIUM WITH FACULTIES ONLY ABOUT AVERAGE COMPARED WITH ORDINARY FUGITIVES FROM DELAWARE AND MARYLAND

WILLIAM STILL:--_DEAR SIR_:--I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM JOSEPH G
GOD'S TRUTH CANNOT BE PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTE IMMUTABLE AND ETERNAL
HE CHARGED THE BLAME UPON A WOMAN WHOSE NAME WAS RICHARDSON WHO HE SAID WAS QUITE A FIGHTER AND WAS NEVER SATISFIED EXCEPT WHEN QUARRELING AND FIGHTING WITH SOME OF THE SLAVES HE ALSO SPOKE OF A CERTAIN T.J
HE ARRIVED BY ONE OF THE RICHMOND BOATS
THE FACT WAS THAT HE HATED SLAVERY SO DECIDEDLY AND HAD SUCH A CLEAR COMMON SENSE-LIKE VIEW OF THE EVILS AND MISERY OF THE SYSTEM THAT HE DECLARED HE HAD AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE REFRAINED FROM MARRYING IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE NO REASON TO GRIEVE OVER HAVING ADDED TO THE WOES OF SLAVES

AFTER THESE GENTLEMEN HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS THE CHAIRMAN PROPOSED THAT THE ADDRESS SHOULD BE PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
HE AND HIS WIFE ARE DEAD
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS BEEN TREATED VERY BADLY AND THAT DUKE BOND WAS THE NAME OF THE TYRANT WHO HELD HIM
WHILE ANTHONY AND ALBERT IN SEEKING THEIR FREEDOM WERE FORCED TO SEVER THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR COMPANIONS THEY DID NOT FORGET THEM IN CANADA
AS FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT HAD IT SO SLAVISH AS MANY BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PRIVILEGES TO LEARN TO READ OR TO GO ABOUT ANYWHERE
HE WAS HELD TO SERVICE IN THAT PLACE BY DR JESSE SQUIRES

TAYLOR BELONGING TO MRS MARGARET TYLER OF HANOVER COUNTY
TOWNSEND HENRY 516
SHE WAS OWNED BY ALGIER PEARCY
I MAY HAVE TO YIELD ON ACCOUNT OF MY VOICE WHICH I THINK HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT AFFECTED
ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO THERE WAS A MAN WITH HIS TWO SONS HURRIED BACK INTO THE INHUMAN BONDAGE FROM WHICH THEY HAD JUST ESCAPED AND THAT MAN THE BROTHER AND THOSE TWO SONS THE NEPHEWS OF A COLORED CLERGYMAN OF NEW YORK OF SUCH EMINENCE IN THE NEW SCHOOL PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THAT HE HAS RECEIVED THE HONORS OF A EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY AND HAS ACTED AS MODERATOR IN ONE OF THE PRESBYTERIES OF THE SAME CHURCH WHEN HELD IN THE CITY WHERE HE RESIDES
THAT YOU--MY LONG TRIED FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE--ARE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK IS TO ME A MATTER OF GREAT PRIDE AND DELIGHT
MOSES WINES
ALSO HE SWORE THAT HE KNEW HER PARENTS WHO WERE SLAVES TO THE SAID DOCTOR P
SHE HAD THE INSPIRATION OF FAITH AND ENTERED HER LIFE-BATTLE AGAINST SLAVERY WITH A DIVINE HOPE AND NOT WITH A GLOOMY DESPAIR
WHITTIER THE EDITORIAL CONDUCT OF THAT PAPER
THE GREAT GRIEVANCE OF WHICH THEY COMPLAIN IS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN THIS
THERE WAS OF COURSE I NEED NOT MENTION OUR EMINENT GUEST OF TO-DAY
THE BROTHERS--EMSON AND PERRY
TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS ONLY REMAINED TO BE PAID TO FINISH THE AGREEMENT
JOHN OFTEN SAID HE WOULD GO BACK AND GET HIS WIFE
WE TO GO DOWN THE TENNESSEE RIVER TO SOME PLACE UP THE OHIO NOT YET DECIDED ON IN OUR ROW BOAT
ONE OF THE METHODS WHICH USED TO SUCCEED VERY WELL IN SKILLFUL AND BRAVE HANDS WAS THIS
IF HE WERE TO WORK AT ALL IN THE CAUSE HE DETERMINED TO WORK WITHIN THE LIMITS OF RECOGNIZED LAW
BUT THESE INCIDENTS WERE NOT RECORDED IN THE BOOK AT THE TIME
MY MISTRESS HAD THREE SISTERS ALL OLD MAIDS LIVING WITH HER AND A NIECE BESIDES
THESE SLAVES FROM MARYLAND WERE THE LAST THAT HARRIET TUBMAN PILOTED OUT OF THE PRISON-HOUSE OF BONDAGE AND THESE CAME THROUGH GREAT TRIBULATION STEPHEN THE HUSBAND HAD BEEN A SLAVE OF JOHN KAIGER WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO LIVE WITH HIS WIFE IF THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS A SLAVE'S OWNING A WIFE SHE LIVED EIGHT MILES DISTANT HIRED HER TIME MAINTAINED HERSELF AND TOOK CARE OF HER CHILDREN UNTIL THEY BECAME OF SERVICE TO THEIR OWNER AND PAID TEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR HER HIRE
THOUGH THIS POOR FUGITIVE WAS UTTERLY IGNORANT OF LETTERS HIS NATURAL GOOD SENSE AND KEEN PERCEPTION QUALIFIED HIM TO ARREST THE ATTENTION AND INTEREST THE HEART IN A MOST REMARKABLE DEGREE
HE WAS ABOUT 22
I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE MASTER ABOVE HAD NO WISH FOR ME TO BE HELD IN BONDAGE ALL MY DAYS
THIS IS JUST THE CLASS OF FUGITIVES TO MAKE GOOD SUBJECTS FOR JOHN BULL THOUGHT THE COMMITTEE FEELING PRETTY WELL ASSURED THAT THEY WOULD MAKE GOOD REPORTS AFTER HAVING ENJOYED FREE AIR IN CANADA FOR A SHORT TIME
I GIVE AND BEQUEATH TO OLIVER JOHNSON EDITOR OF THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF HE BE LIVING AT MY DEATH
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE KINDNESS THAT JAMES HAD RECEIVED HE HATED SLAVERY AND TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND USED HIS INTELLIGENCE AND SHREWDNESS TO GOOD PURPOSE IN ACTING AS AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT FOR A TIME
HE WAS NOT A FAIR MAN NO WAY AND HIS WIFE WAS WORSE THAN HE WAS AND SHE HAD A DAUGHTER WORSE THAN HERSELF LAST SUNDAY A WEEK MY MASTER COLLARED ME FOR MY INSOLENCE HE SAID AND TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD SELL ME RIGHT OFF
ALABAMA LAWS UTTERLY DENIED THE RIGHT OF A SLAVE TO BUY HIMSELF MUCH LESS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
FOR THIS PRIVILEGE THE MOTHER DOUBTLESS WORKED WITH DOUBLE ENERGY AND THE MASTER IN ALL PROBABILITY WAS LARGELY THE GAINER AS THE CHILDREN WERE NO EXPENSE TO HIM IN THEIR INFANCY
KIMBER WILL BE IN THE CITY ON THIRD DAY THE 30TH AND ANY THING LEFT AT 408 GREEN STREET DIRECTED TO HIS CARE WILL MEET WITH PROMPT ATTENTION
REASONS WERE FOUND WHY NO ONE ELSE COULD DO IT AND WITH HER OWN HANDS SHE MINISTERED TO HIS WANTS UNTIL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
THEY STOPPED ALSO AT A SIMILAR HOTEL IN RICHMOND AND WITH LIKE RESULTS
THE MISTRESS ANSWER WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO GIVE HER ANYTHING UNTIL SHE WENT TO WORK AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE SENT WORD TO HER THAT SHE HAD BETTER TAKE HER BABY DOWN TO THE BACK OF THE GARDEN AND THROW IT AWAY ADDING I WILL SELL HER ETC IT WAS OWING TO THE CRUELTY OF MRS TUNIS THAT WILLIAM WAS MOVED TO FLEE
ALL THANKS TO MR STILL FOR THUS PLACING THIS NOBLE RECORD OF THE FREE AND THOSE STRUGGLING TO BE FREE BEFORE THE WORLD
WILLIAM AND ONE OF THE ACCOMMODATING CAPTAINS RUNNING ON THE RICHMOND AND PHILADELPHIA LINE TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WILLIAM SHOULD HAVE A FIRST CLASS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BERTH SO PERFECTLY PRIVATE THAT EVEN THE LAW-OFFICERS COULD NOT FIND HIM
I HAVE HEARD THOUGH THAT OFTEN DURING THE WAR MEN HIRED OUT THEIR WIVES AND DREW THEIR PAY AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER TROUBLE SOME OF OUR NORTHERN MEN HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS WAY AND BY SOME MEANS THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE BEST IMPRESSION ON EVERY MIND HERE
SO HE DECIDED TO ACCOMPANY FRANK LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT
THAT HE HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO BY AN ABOLITIONIST IN BALTIMORE TO KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR THOSE SLAVES THAT LEFT CAMBRIDGE THIS NIGHT WEEK TOLD HIM THEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO PASS THROUGH WILMINGTON ON 6TH DAY OR 7TH DAY NIGHT AND THE COLORED MAN IN PHILA
ON A VISIT TO BOSTON IN 1859 THE WRITER FOUND MARY AT MR HILLIARD'S AND IN AN ARTICLE WRITTEN FOR THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD UPON THE CONDITION OF FUGITIVE SLAVES IN BOSTON AND NEW BEDFORD ALLUSION WAS MADE PARTICULARLY TO HER AND SEVERAL OTHERS UNDER THIS HOSPITABLE ROOF IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH
FOR ME THIS IS INDEED AN ANOMALOUS POSITION
HIS PLACE OF BONDAGE WAS IN THE CITY OF NORFOLK VA WHERE HE WAS HELD TO SERVICE BY DR C.F
NELSON
NELSON
I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONTEMPTIBLE WORK OF ARRESTING FUGITIVES
LEVI D
IT WAS RAINY AND MUDDY--MY PANTS WERE ROLLED UP TO THE KNEES
AFTER HIS REMOVAL TO NEW YORK AND WHEN THE OCCASION FOR HIS PERSONAL LABORS IN THE CAUSE OF THE SLAVE HAD IN SOME MEASURE CEASED OR SLACKENED HE THREW HIS WHOLE HEART INTO THE PRISON ASSOCIATION WHOSE AIMS AND PLANS OF ACTION WERE ENTIRELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS VIEWS AND INDEED IN A GREAT DEGREE BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCE AND ADVICE
HE ACCEDED TO THE REQUEST AND REMAINED THERE ONE YEAR ZEALOUSLY PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY
AFTER THEE HAS SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH THEM THEE CAN DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE WITH THEM
ZACHARIAH BOWEN RECALLED.--"I DIDN'T COME HERE ON ANY TERMS
IT IS PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE THAT MAY TURN UP IN THESE RECORDS TO THE DISGRACE OF THIS BODY OF CHRISTIANS IN WHOM DWELT IN SUCH A SIGNAL DEGREE LARGE SYMPATHY FOR THE SLAVE AND THE FLEEING BONDMAN
I OFTEN FEEL AS IF I WERE WILLING TO DIE
HALL JACOB ALIAS HENRY THOMAS WIFE HENRIETTA AND CHILD 339
TORONTO MARCH 18TH 1864
I HAVE JUST BEEN HAVING SOME GOOD MEETINGS THERE
IN THE MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT ESPECIALLY SAM WAS CALLED UPON TO EXECUTE THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT BUT I CAN GET THROUGH WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE
DO YOU LIKE THE COUNTRY FIRST-RATE SAID JOHN WILLIAM
AND AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF HER EMPLOYER HER GREED FOR BOOKS WAS SATISFIED SO FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE FROM OCCASIONAL HALF-HOURS OF LEISURE
I AM SO FAR REMOVED AWAY HERE IN YANKEEDOM THAT I HEAR NOTHING FROM THAT QUARTER BUT BY THE PUBLIC PRINTS
SO HARRY CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE SUFFERINGS AND ADVENTURES WHICH HAD MARKED HIS OWN LIFE
FOR THOUGH THEIR ANTI-SLAVERY MINISTER HAD LEFT AND HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY OTHERS OF DIFFERENT SENTIMENTS AND THOUGH HE HAD WITHDRAWN FROM THE CHURCH WITH WHICH THEY WERE IN COMMON CONNECTED AND THAT ON GROUNDS WHICH SUBJECTED HIM TO THE IMPUTATION AND PENALTIES AF HERESY THESE GOOD PEOPLE DID NOT FEEL CALLED UPON TO CHANGE THEIR RELATIONS OF PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP NOR DID THEY MAKE IT A PRETEXT AS OTHERS HAVE DONE FOR ABANDONING THE CAUSE IN OCTOBER 1836 HE ACCEPTED A LECTURING AGENCY UNDER THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY AS ONE OF THE SEVENTY GATHERED FROM ALL PROFESSIONS WHOM THEODORE D

A VESSEL SUBJECT TO INSPECTION UNDER THIS LAW DEPARTING FROM ANY OF THE ABOVE-NAMED COUNTIES OR RIVERS ON HER VOYAGE TO SEA SHALL BE EXEMPTED FROM THE PAYMENT OF A FEE FOR A SECOND INSPECTION BY ANOTHER OFFICER IF PROVIDED WITH A CERTIFICATE FROM THE PROPER INSPECTING OFFICER OF THAT DISTRICT
SEND NO NOTES LARGER THAN TWENTY DOLLARS
FOR AN EMERGENCY HE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH A PAIR OF PISTOLS AND A FORMIDABLE-LOOKING KNIFE AND STARTED BENT ON REACHING CANADA
THIS PARTY MADE AT FIRST SIGHT A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION
THIS CONTRACT FOR THE TERM OF YEARS CHARLES FELT WAS MADE WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM THEREFORE HE RESOLVED TO BREAK IT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS MASTER
AND IN REALITY HER EVIDENCE FOR TWO REASONS SHOULD NOT HAVE WEIGHED A STRAW AS IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA TO ADMIT THE TESTIMONY OF COLORED PERSONS AGAINST WHITE
IN THE DARKNESS IN WHICH SLAVERY ORDINARILY KEPT THE FETTERED AND FREE NIGGERS IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME ERE ROSANNA SAW HOW BARBAROUSLY SHE AND HER RACE WERE BEING WRONGED AND GROUND DOWN--DRIVEN TO DO UNREQUITED LABOR--DEPRIVED OF AN EDUCATION OBLIGED TO RECEIVE THE CUFFS KICKS AND CURSES OF OLD OR YOUNG WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO CLAIM A TITLE TO THEM
BY THE 6 O'CLOCK TRAIN_--ONE OR MORE ALSO AS THE CASE MAY BE
NEVERTHELESS THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA OCCASIONALLY HAD THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING SOME HEROES WHO WERE WORTHY TO BE CLASSED AMONG THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE NO MATTER WHO THEY MAY BE WHO HAVE CLAIMS TO THIS DISTINCTION
I WILL DO WHAT I CAN HERE FOR IT
HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HANDS THAT HAD NOT TREATED HIM HARSHLY
IT WILL BE OF PERMANENT VALUE TO THE HISTORIAN OF THE COUNTRY DURING THE ANTI-SLAVERY STRUGGLE
THE YOUNGEST BOY ON BEING PUT IN THE CARRIAGE WAS TOLD THAT HE WAS A FOOL FOR CRYING SO AFTER MASSA JOHN WHO WOULD SELL HIM IF HE EVER CAUGHT HIM NOT ANOTHER WHINE WAS HEARD ON THE SUBJECT
AN ACT OF CONGRESS THEN IN FORCE IMPOSED A PENALTY OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON ANY PERSON WHO SHOULD KNOWINGLY HARBOR OR CONCEAL A FUGITIVE FROM LABOR TO BE RECOVERED BY AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CLAIMANT OF SUCH FUGITIVE IN ANY COURT PROPER TO TRY THE SAME

ELIZA HAD BEEN OWNED BY ANDREW SIGANY OF NORFOLK--AGE ABOUT THIRTY-EIGHT--MULATTO AND A WOMAN WHOSE APPEARANCE WOULD READILY COMMAND ATTENTION AND RESPECT ANYWHERE OUTSIDE OF THE BARBARISM OF SLAVERY

TREASON
ALMOST AT THE VERY MOMENT THE POOR FUGITIVE WITH HIS CHILDREN WERE DRAGGED THROUGH OUR CITY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THAT VERY BRANCH OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOW IN SESSION HERE AFTER DISCUSSING FOR DAYS THE VALIDITY OF ROMAN CATHOLIC BAPTISM THREW OUT AS INEXPEDIENT TO BE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THAT GREAT WRONG WHICH WAS FLINGING BACK INTO THE AGONY OF SLAVERY A BROTHER OF ONE OF THEIR OWN ORDAINED MINISTERS AND COULD NOT SO MUCH AS BREATHE A WORD OF CONDEMNATION AGAINST THE FALSE AND CRUEL DEED WHICH HAS JUST BEEN CONSUMMATED AT THE CAPITOL OF THE NATION
I CAN BUT STOP AND LOOK OVER MY PAST LIFE AND SAY WHAT A FOOL I WAS FOR STAYING IN BONDAGE AS LONG
I AM NOW LIVING WITH MY COUSIN LEVEN PARKER NEAR SAINT CATHARINES $10 A MONTH
LAST EVENING THE CHURCH AT THE CORNER OF PRINCE AND MARION STREETS WAS FILLED WITH AN INTELLIGENT AUDIENCE OF WHITE AND COLORED PEOPLE TO HEAR DR PENNINGTON RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECTED WITH THE ARREST OF HIS BROTHER AND NEPHEWS
HE WAS RAISED WITH HER SISTER WHO RESIDED IN NORFOLK THE PLACE OF JAMES SERVITUDE
HE CONTINUED IN THE POSSESSION OF HIS FACULTIES TO THE LAST AND FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED HIS ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO DIE
THEY DID NOT PRETEND TO KEEP THEIR COMING A SECRET OR HIDE IT UNDER A BUSHEL
A WHITE MAN WOULD BE BEST AND THEN EVEN PARTIES LED OUT BY HIM COULD NOT IF THEY WOULD TESTIFY TO ANY UNDERSTANDING OR ANYTHING ELSE AGAINST A WHITE MAN
IT WAS FOUND HOWEVER THAT ONE OF THEIR NUMBER AT LEAST HAD A SAD TALE OF OUTRAGE AND CRUELTY TO RELATE
THENCE HE SOUGHT SHELTER NEITHER WITH KINFOLKS CHRISTIANS NOR INFIDELS BUT IN THIS HOUR OF HIS CALAMITY HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TRY LIVING UNDER A LARGE HOTEL FOR A WHILE
HE WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF A JET COLOR BUT OF A MANLY TURN
IN EITHER CASE HE MUST BE SECURED SO THAT I GET HIM
JOHNSON GEO 413
THIS FACT WAS DULY PUBLISHED IN THE COUNTY PAPERS AND HER MASTER WENT AFTER HIS CHATTEL AND HAVING PAID THE EXPENSES OF HER CAPTURE TOOK IMMEDIATE POSSESSION THEREOF
WE WOULD LOOK TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND NOT LEGISLATE FOR THE GOOD OF AN OLIGARCHY THE MOST ARROGANT THAT EVER LORDED IT OVER AN INSULTED PEOPLE
YOUR MOTHER SAYS THAT I MUST TELL YOU SERVANT JONES IS DEAD AND OLD MRS GALT
PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECEIPT OF THIS AND INFORM ME OF HER ARRIVAL ALSO WHEN THE PACKAGES CAME SAFE TO HAND INFORM ME ESPECIALLY IF SUSAN'S CAME SAFELY
ON THE WHOLE WE ARE VERY GLAD WE ACCEPTED THE ZION'S INVITATION
HE HAD A WIFE AND SPOKE OF HER IN MOST ENDEARING LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH ON LEAVING HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO APPRISE HER OF HIS MOVEMENTS FEARING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE SO TO DO HIS FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN TO WHOM HE APPEARED WARMLY ATTACHED HE LEFT AS HE DID HIS WIFE--IN SLAVERY
WAS OUT OF TOWN ETC
THIS PLACE WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF WHITE HALL FARM AND WAS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF JAMES EDWARD STEVENS A SON OF THE ABOVE-NAMED STEVENS
YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF FREEDOM WITHOUT RECALLING THAT ENFRANCHISED SPIRIT WHICH FREE FROM ALL CONTROL SAVE THAT OF CONSCIENCE AND GOD LABORED FOR ABSOLUTE LIBERTY FOR THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
HE FLED FROM RICHMOND WHERE HE HAD BEEN HELD BY ALEXANDER ROYSTER THE OWNER OF FIFTEEN SLAVES AND A TOBACCO MERCHANT
AFTER HIS LIBERATION FROM THE PENITENTIARY WE HAD FROM HIS OWN LIPS NARRATIONS OF HIS YEARS OF SUFFERING--OF THE BITTER CUP THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO DRINK AND OF HIS BEING SUSTAINED BY THE ALMIGHTY ARM--BUT NO NOTES WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ADD CONCERNING HIM SAVE QUITE A FAITHFUL LIKENESS
THROUGH ONE OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENTS THE GLAD TIDINGS WERE BORNE TO HIM THAT A PASSAGE MIGHT BE PROCURED ON A SCHOONER FOR TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS
AGAINST FITCHHUGH HE MADE GRAVE CHARGES SAID THAT HE WAS A HARD BAD MAN IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT ISAAC WAS SIMILARLY REGARDED BY HIS MASTER SO BOTH WERE DISSATISFIED WITH EACH OTHER
IN JULY 1853 HE WAS TAKEN TO AN INFIRMARY IN MACON
THAT CITIZENS OF A NEIGHBORING STATE HAVE BEEN CRUELLY ASSASSINATED BY A BAND OF ARMED OUTLAWS AT A PLACE NOT MORE THAN THREE HOURS JOURNEY DISTANT FROM THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT AND FROM THE COMMERCIAL METROPOLIS OF THE STATE

FORNEY EDITOR OF THE PRESS PUBLISHED JULY 12 1871 WITH THE BRIEF EDITORIAL HEADING BY HIS OWN HAND THE DOCUMENT APPENDED
ON EXAMINING THE SIX PASSENGERS WHO CAME BY THIS ARRIVAL THEY WERE THUS RECORDED
THIS IT WAS THAT SENT HIM AWAY IT IS VERY CERTAIN THAT THIS IRISH GIRL WAS NOT ANNOYED BY THE KINKS IN JOHN'S HAIR
FRIEND COCHRAN INSISTED ON GOING WITH THEM AND SAW THE GIRL DEPOSITED IN JAIL TO AWAIT A LEGAL INVESTIGATION
WE SHALL NOW WATCH WITH ANXIOUS HOPE THE DEVELOPMENT AMIDST THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH STILL BESET THE REGENERATION OF THE SOUTH OF A HAPPIER ORDER OF THINGS IN THE STATES RESCUED FROM SLAVERY AND THE GROWTH OF FREE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH YOUR NAME WITH THE NAMES OF YOUR FELLOW-WORKERS IN THE SAME CAUSE WILL BE HELD IN GRATEFUL AND LASTING REMEMBRANCE
TO ACT AS MEN AND REMEMBER THOSE STILL IN BONDS AS BOUND WITH THEM AND THAT THEY MUST NOT FORGET TO WRITE BACK AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN CANADA TO INFORM THEIR FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA OF THEIR PROSPECTS AND WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THE GOODLY LAND THUS WITH THE USUAL UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSPORTS THEY WERE AGAIN STARTED CANADA-WARD
IN SO DOING ALL DANGERS WOULD BE IN THEIR JUDGMENT AVERTED
IT WAS NOT THE WORK I THINK OF ANY MAN OR BODY OF MEN

LET EVERY HEART WITH GLADNESS THRILL AND SONGS OF JOYFUL TRIUMPH RAISE
THEN TOO PETER HAD A WIFE WHOM HIS MASTER PREVENTED HIM FROM VISITING
PETER WAS OWNED BY GEORGE WENTHROP A FARMER LIVING NEAR CAMBRIDGE MD
HE DID NOT HESITATE TO SELL SLAVES IF HE COULD GET HIS PRICE
THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE WERE BOTH EQUALLY SEVERE TOWARDS THEM
THE OCCASION OF THIS INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION THE SERIOUSNESS OF CONCKLIN AND THE UTTER FAILURE IN PRESENTING THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES TO HIS PLAN TO CREATE THE SLIGHTEST APPARENT MISGIVING IN HIS MIND OR TO PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST SENSE OF FEAR OR HESITANCY CAN NEVER BE EFFACED FROM THE MEMORY OF THE WRITER
IF YOU CAN GIVE ME ANY LIGHT THAT WILL BENEFIT OTHERS I AM SURE YOU WILL DO SO
HIS NEAR RELATIVES LEFT IN BONDAGE LIVED NEAR LEVEL SQUARE QUEEN ANN'S COUNTY MARYLAND
FINALLY AFTER MUCH ANXIOUS PREPARATION AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO WITH CAPTAIN B ON BEHALF OF HIMSELF WIFE CHILD AND LOUISA BELL WHICH WAS MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY TO ALL CONCERNED AND AFFORDED GREAT HOPE TO WILLIAM
HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NOT DO THAT THAT THEY MIGHT SEARCH HIS PREMISES IF THEY WISHED TO BUT THEY COULD NOT COMPEL HIM TO BRING FORTH THE FUGITIVES
JACOB WAS A STOUT AND HEALTHY-LOOKING MAN ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WITH A COUNTENANCE INDICATIVE OF HAVING NO SYMPATHY WITH SLAVERY
CERTAINLY NO VOLUME EVER MET WITH HIGHER OR MORE EXTENSIVE ENDORSEMENT
THE MOUNTAIN BEING THUS REMOVED THE YOUNG PLANTER AND HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WERE SAFELY IN THE CARS FOR THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE
LOOKED THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE FIRST PERSON WHOM HE SAW WAS HARRIS
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD OFFERED
THE MEN THEN ASKED US WHERE WE WERE GOING
IT WAS HIGHLY PLEASING TO HAVE A VISIT FROM A CHATTEL BELONGING TO THE LEADING ADVOCATE OF THE INFAMOUS FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL
INSTANTLY SOCIABLE
WASHINGTON D.C OCTOBER 12 1855

OFTEN WHEN THE TREASURY OF THE COMMITTEE RAN LOW HE CAME OPPORTUNELY TO THEIR RELIEF WITH FUNDS SENT BY HIS ENGLISH FRIENDS WHILE HIS SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGEMENT NEVER FAILED
HE WAS FAITHFUL AMONG THE FAITHLESS UPRIGHT AND JUST IN THE MIDST OF A WICKED AND PERVERSE GENERATION AND LIVED TO SEE HIS LABORS REWARDED AND APPROVED IN HIS OWN LIFE-TIME AND THEN WITH JOY THAT THE RIGHT HAD TRIUMPHED BY MIGHTIER MEANS THAN HIS OWN

FIVE PAIR WOOLEN SOCKS 3 $1,88
BOTH THESE TRAVELERS WERE MULATTOES AND BUT FOR THE CRUSHING INFLUENCES THAT THEY HAD LIVED UNDER WOULD HAVE MADE SMART MEN--AS IT WAS THEY SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THEY WERE MEN OF SHREWD SENSE
IN 1846 HE COMMUNICATED TO A FEW LIBERAL-MINDED PROFESSIONAL MEN A PLAN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COLLEGE OF THE HIGHEST GRADE FOR THE MEDICAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN

THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM REMAINED CALM EVEN WHILE THE PRO-SLAVERY PARTY WERE FIERCELY RAGING AND GLOATING OVER THE PROSPECT AS THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT OF THE SATISFACTION TO BE DERIVED FROM TEACHING THE ABOLITIONISTS A LESSON FROM THE SCAFFOLD WHICH WOULD IN FUTURE PREVENT UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS FROM KILLING THEIR MASTERS WHEN IN PURSUIT OF THEM
HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP ON A FARM UNDER H

HIS BONDAGE HAD BEEN IN ALEXANDRIA WITH A MILL-WRIGHT KNOWN BY THE NAME OF JAMES GARNETT
HE CLAIMED THAT HE WAS ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM ACCORDING TO LAW AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-EIGHT BUT HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED OF IT
HE OWNS THREE OF MY BROTHERS

SHE WAS A VERY NICE WOMAN BUT HE WAS THE VERY OLD SATAN HIMSELF WHILE WILLIAM HENRY WAS DEBARRED FROM LEARNING LETTERS UNDER HIS BRUTAL OVERSEER HE NEVERTHELESS LEARNED HOW TO PLAN WAYS AND MEANS BY WHICH TO ESCAPE HIS BONDAGE
HE SAVED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CASH
AS TO HER GOING ON TO NEW YORK TO SEE HER FRIENDS AND WISHING TO RETURN TO HER THREE CHILDREN IN THE SOUTH AND HIS GOING TO FREE HER C JANE DECLARED REPEATEDLY AND VERY POSITIVELY THAT THERE WAS NOT A PARTICLE OF TRUTH IN WHAT HER MASTER SAID ON THESE POINTS
DR FURNESS'S WORDS AND COUNSELS WERE NOT WANTING THROUGHOUT THE WAR AND HIS SERMONS WERE CONSTANTLY PRINTED IN THE DAILY PRESS AND IN SEPARATE PAMPHLET FORM
IN THE ESTIMATION OF SLAVE-HOLDERS THE FACT OF CHARLES HAVING A FAMILY MIGHT HAVE OFFERED NO CAUSE FOR UNHAPPINESS BUT CHARLES FELT DIFFERENTLY IN RELATION TO THE MATTER
AND I TRUST YOU WILL TRY WHAT YOU THINK WILL BE THE BEST WAY
AS A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS SHE LAMENTED THE GUILTY SUPINENESS OF THAT BODY IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY AND OFTEN IN ITS MEETINGS AS WELL AS IN PRIVATE INTERCOURSE FELT HERSELF CONSTRAINED TO UTTER THE LANGUAGE OF EXPOSTULATION AND REBUKE
I HAVE SIMPLY TRIED TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF MY SOUL BEFORE GOD AND TO DO MY DUTY
THAT EVENING AT DARK HE WAS AT THE WHARF ACCORDING TO PROMISE
IT WAS THE PARTICULAR FAVOR OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER THAT MADE ME RECOGNIZE HER
LLOYD CONVINCED BY EXPERIENCE THAT MATTERS WITH HIM WOULD BE NO BETTER BUT WORSE AND WORSE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD START WITH THE OPENING OF THE NEW YEAR TO SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND A BETTER COUNTRY THAN THE ONE THAT HE WAS THEN IN
DEAR FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--YOUR ENCOURAGING LETTER TO JOHN SMITH WAS DULY RECEIVED BY HIM AND I AM REQUESTED TO WRITE AGAIN ON HIS BEHALF
WELL MAY THE SOUTHERN SLAVEHOLDER SAY THAT HOLDING THEIR FELLOW MEN IN BONDAGE IS NO SIN BECAUSE IT IS THEIR DELIGHT AS THE EGYPTIANS SO DO THEY
THERE IS STILL NEED OF EFFICIENT LABORERS IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY
FOR THREE YEARS LEEDS HAD BEEN THIRSTING FOR HIS LIBERTY
HE WAS A MOST SELF-DENYING PATIENT LOVING FRIEND OF THE POOR AND THE SUFFERING OF EVERY KIND
THERE ARE BUT FEW MEN AND STILL FEWER MINISTERS WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE COMFORT FROM SUCH RECOLLECTIONS
HER STRENGTH AND HOPE WERE SOON FULLY RESTORED AND SHE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FALL INTO THE RIGHT HANDS
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS HE CONSIDERED WAS TO SAVE HIS MONEY AND MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO THE CAPTAIN TO HELP HIM

FRANCIS INFORMED THEM HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH CAMPBELL AND HE AT ONCE ACCOMPAINED THEM
HE CAN READ AND WRITE WELL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HE HAS PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH PAPERS OF SOME KIND
THUS ENDED THIS ACT IN THE WHEELER DRAMA
IN PLANNING THE ROUTE WHICH HE SHOULD TAKE TO TRAVEL NORTH HE DECIDED THAT IF SUCCESS WAS FOR HIM HIS BEST CHANCE WOULD BE TO WEND HIS WAY THROUGH NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA
HIS FIRMNESS AND COURAGE SLOWLY WON OTHERS FIRST TO ADMIRE AND THEN TO ASSIST HIM AND THE LITTLE BAND OF FAITHFUL WORKERS OF WHICH HE WAS CHIEF GRADUALLY ENLARGED AND INCLUDED IN ITS NUMBER MEN OF ALL RANKS AND DIFFERING CREEDS AND SINGULAR AS IT MAY SEEM EVEN NUMBERING SOME ARDENT DEMOCRATS IN ITS RANKS

WHILE THIS PARTY WAS VERY RESPECTABLE IN REGARD TO NUMBERS AND ENLISTED MUCH SYMPATHY STILL THEY HAD NO WOUNDS OR BRUISES TO EXHIBIT OR VERY HARD REPORTS TO MAKE RELATIVE TO THEIR BONDAGE
TO-NIGHT I AM GOING OVER TO GEORGIA TO LECTURE
OPERATIONS
THE ONLY CHANCE OF PROCURING HER FREEDOM DEPENDED UPON GETTING HER AWAY ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
FOR SHE HAD BEEN RECENTLY THREATENED BY HENRY HARLEY WHO FOLLOWED DROVING AND NOT BEING RICH AT ANY TIME WHEN HE MIGHT BE IN WANT OF MONEY SHE FELT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TO GO
BUT PETER SEEMED FILLED WITH GREAT DELIGHT AT THE PROSPECTS AHEAD AS WELL AS WITH THE SUCCESS THAT HAD ATTENDED HIS EFFORTS THUS FAR IN STRIKING FOR FREEDOM
SHE MUST TRUST TO MY HONESTY--SHE COULD COUNT FORTY CENTS
THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS A REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT LADY-LIKE PERSON AND HER STORY MADE A STRONG APPEAL TO MY FEELINGS
SHE HAD $55 TO PAY FOR THIS FAVOR WHICH AMOUNT SHE RAISED BY WASHING ETC
I KNEW THAT SHE HAD TWO CHILDREN THAT WERE BURIED AS LONG AS TWENTY-ONE OR TWENTY-TWO YEARS AGO
AND MAY HEAVEN'S RICHEST BLESSINGS REWARD THEM
AS A LECTURER MRS HARPER IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MOST OF THOSE WHO COME BEFORE OUR LYCEUMS
UNDER THE APPREHENSION THAT THIS THREAT WOULD PROVE NO JOKE HENRY BEGAN TO STUDY WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO TO BE SAVED FROM THE JAWS OF HUNGRY NEGRO TRADERS
MARTHA REEVE $1
WAS PRETTY WELL SUITED BUT HIS WIFE WAS NOT--HE HAD TOO MUCH WHITE BLOOD IN HIM FOR HER
WITHOUT BEING INDEBTED TO HER OWNERS FOR ANY PRIVILEGES SHE HAD MANAGED TO LEARN TO READ A LITTLE WHICH KNOWLEDGE SHE VALUED HIGHLY AND MEANT TO IMPROVE IN CANADA
WHEN HE RESOLVED ON HAVING HIS FREEDOM HE WAS MUCH UNDER TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE A BRAVE YOUNG MAN FOR THREE YEARS WITH UNFAILING SPIRIT MAKING RESISTANCE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND TO THE SLAVE POWER

JOHN ESCAPED FROM NEAR WASHINGTON
TRUE THEY WERE INTENDED ONLY FOR PRIVATE USE BUT SINCE THE TRUE LIGHT FREEDOM HAS COME ALL THINGS MAY BE MADE MANIFEST
AS HE WAS NEITHER A PRIEST NOR A LEVITE HE TOOK THE ROPE FROM HER FEET AND GUIDED HER TO A CABIN NEAR AT HAND WHERE SHE WAS KINDLY RECEIVED
SUCH MENACES FAILED HOWEVER TO DETER HIM FROM THE STEADY PERFORMANCE OF WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE A SOLEMN DUTY
THERE WAS LYDIA MARIA CHILD
YOURS N.R
PARLETT
BUT THE CHIEF VALUE OF THE BOOK WILL BE FOUND IN ITS MAIN NARRATIVES WHICH ILLUSTRATE TO THE LIFE THE CHARACTER OF SLAVERY THE SPIRIT AND TEMPER OF THE MEN ENGAGED FOR ITS OVERTHROW AND THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH HAD TO BE OVERCOME BY THESE MEN IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THEIR PURPOSE
ROBERT HAD TOO MUCH SENSE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE COULD GAIN ANYTHING BY SEEKING LEGAL REDRESS
WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE AND A READY WIT HE REPLIED SO MR GARRISON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 1830 AND 1864 APPEARS TO BE THIS
HAVING SEEN HER FATHER THREE SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS DISPOSED OF AT AUCTION SHE WAS DAILY ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR HER TURN TO COME NEXT
THUS FOR A DAY OR TWO WITHOUT FOOD OR SHELTER HE TRAVELED UNTIL HIS FEET WERE LITERALLY WORN OUT AND IN THIS CONDITION HE ARRIVED AT HARRISBURG WHERE HE FOUND FRIENDS
SUCH APPEALS CAME VERY FREQUENTLY FROM CANADA CAUSING MUCH SADNESS AS BUT LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT COULD BE HELD OUT TO SUCH PROJECTS
BEING FOR MANY YEARS AN INSPECTOR OF THE PUBLIC PRISONS HIS PRACTICAL SAGACITY AND BENEVOLENCE WERE USED WITH MARKED RESULTS
MY MASTER WAS A RED-FACED FARMER SEVERE TEMPER WOULD CURSE AND SWEAR AND DRINK AND SELL HIS SLAVES WHENEVER HE FELT LIKE IT
INDEED THE CHURCHES ARE CLOSED AGAINST THEM
A WEEK PREVIOUS WE HAD VISITED HIM IN HIS SICK CHAMBER AND ON LEAVING HIM FELT THAT HE MUST GO HENCE ERE LONG
HE COULD HARDLY TELL SUNDAY FROM MONDAY IN NEW ORLEANS THE SLAVES WERE KEPT SO CONSTANTLY GOING
ON THE SIDE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW AND AGAINST THE TRAITORS WERE U.S
WE HAVE QUITE A MELANCHOLY AFFAIR ABOUT ONE OF OUR COLORED BROTHERS WHO MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM THE SOUTH THOSE WHO TOOK HIM UP HAVE GONE BACK TO OBTAIN WITNESS TO CONVICT HIM FOR MURDER
BY THIS COURSE THE RELUCTANCE WHERE IT EXISTED WOULD BE OVERCOME AND THE PROPOSITION WOULD BE READILY ACCEDED TO IF THE WATER WAS NOT TOO COOL
I WILL GIVE EACH OF THEM A CARD OF OUR FIRM
THIS CALLING HE CONCLUDED TO FORSAKE NOT BECAUSE HE DISLIKED FARMING BUT SIMPLY TO GET RID OF DAVID CLARGART WHO PROFESSED TO OWN HIM AND COMPELLED HIM TO WORK WITHOUT PAY FOR NOTHING WHILE CHARLES SPOKE FAVORABLY OF CLARGART AS A MAN TO THE EXTENT AT ALL EVENTS OF TESTIFYING THAT HE WAS NOT WHAT WAS CALLED A HARD MAN NEVERTHELESS CHARLES WAS SO DECIDEDLY OPPOSED TO SLAVERY THAT HE FELT COMPELLED TO LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF
NEXT DAY HIS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY COMMENCED BUT INSTEAD OF HIS ENJOYING THE SIGHT OF HIS MOTHER HE FELT THAT HE HAD SEEN HER FOR THE LAST TIME IN THE FLESH

AGE AND FLESH AND SIZE MAKE A DIFFERENCE
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THERE IS ONE AMONG YOUR HEARERS WHO DOES NOT AGREE WITH YOU
IN THE SECOND PLACE I AM WILLING TO DO SO
NEVER HAVE I HAD MY SYMPATHIES SO AROUSED IN BEHALF OF ANY OBJECT AS IN BEHALF OF THIS MOST WORTHY FAMILY
MEN WHOM HE HAS WARNED IN REPROOF WHEN IT COST THE UTMOST BRAVERY TO DO SO HAVE BECOME HIS CONFIDING FRIENDS AND HAVE BEEN KNOWN AFTERWARD TO ENTRUST HIM WITH HEAVY PECUNIARY RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO POINT HIM OUT TO THEIR CHILDREN AS AN EXAMPLE WORTHY OF IMITATION

THE HOUR FOR FORWARDING THE PARTY BY THE COMMITTEE CAME TOO SOON TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE WRITING OF ANY ACCOUNT OF PETER PENNINGTON AND ELIZA NOKEY
THUS TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE BLOW ALL THE PRO-SLAVERY ELEMENTS OF PHILADELPHIA WERE BROUGHT INTO ACTION AND MATTERS LOOKED FOR A TIME AS THOUGH SLAVERY IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING ITS OWN WAY
ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE HE WAS OF SCOTCH IRISH ON HIS MOTHER'S MILLER OF GERMAN DESCENT
THE MALE LEADER OF THE FUGITIVES BY THIS TIME HAD PULLED BACK THE HAMMERS OF HIS PISTOLS AND WAS ABOUT TO FIRE
CHILDS WHOSE FAITHFUL SERVICES WERE FREELY GIVEN
I COLLECTED ONLY TWELVE DOLLARS AND IN ROCHESTER ONLY TWO DOLLARS
BEING INVITED THEY STAYED AWHILE IN THE MEETING THEN AFTER REMAINING ALL NIGHT WITH ONE OF THE KENNETT FRIENDS THEY WERE BROUGHT TO DOWNINGTOWN EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THENCE BY DAYLIGHT WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF KIMBERTON AND FOUND SUCCOR WITH FRIEND LEWIS AT THE OLD HEADQUARTERS OF THE FUGITIVES
I MADE NO CONTRACT IN REGARD TO THIS CASE
THERE WAS NOTHING IN JOHN'S APPEARANCE WHICH WOULD LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS A BLOOD-THIRSTY OR BAD MAN ALTHOUGH A MAN OF UNCOMMON MUSCULAR POWERS
WE DO NOT ASK FOR SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE FORWARDED THROUGH NEWCASTLE UNLESS THIS BE A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE TO THOSE CONCERNED
CHARLES THOMPSON

I AM GOING TO SEE HER THIS AFTERNOON
BUT MOST FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES STOOD IN THE WAY OF OPENING CORRESPONDENCE WITH RELIABLE PERSONS IN ALABAMA
I AM EVIDENTLY WATCHED
HE HAS A WIFE AND SEVERAL CHILDREN AND WHATEVER BOUNTY THE GOVERNMENT OR THE STATE ALLOWS HIM WILL BE OF USE TO HIS FAMILY
PLEASE DIRECT YOUR LETTERS TO ME NEAR THE CORNER SARAH AND EDWARD STREET UNTIL I GIVE YOU FURTHER NOTICE
BUT I DISMISSED THE MEETING AND WENT WITH HIM IMMEDIATELY TO THE AFRICAN CHURCH WHERE THE COLORED BRETHREN WERE HOLDING A MEETING
YOU ARE PERFECTLY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT AFTER THE DECISION IN YORK PA OF THE CELEBRATED PRIGG CASE PENNSYLVANIA WAS REGARDED AS FREE TERRITORY WHICH CANADA AFTERWARDS PROVED TO BE AND THAT THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER WAS THE RECOGNIZED NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE SLAVE-HOLDING EMPIRE
P.S.--I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
AND NOW REJOICING HERE WITH YOU AT THE MARVELLOUS CHANGE WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC I AM UNABLE TO EXPRESS THE SATISFACTION I FEEL IN BELIEVING THAT HENCEFORTH MY COUNTRY WILL BE A MIGHTY POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
WHEN OTHERS DESERTED THE CAUSE HE STOOD FIRM
WILMINGTON 3D MO 27TH 1857
HOWEVER THEY MUSTERED COURAGE AND PRIED OFF THE LID
HE WAS OWNED BY MRS MARIA HANSFORD OF NEW YORK
NOR DID HIS TEN MONTHS TRIAL WARRING AGAINST THE BARBARISM OF SLAVERY SEEM TOO GREAT TO ENDURE FOR FREEDOM

AND THE CONSUMMATION OF HIS PRAYERS AND LABORS FOR THE SALVATION OF HIS COUNTRY
AND SO HE RESOLVED TO LEAVE FOR CANADA AS SOON AS HE COULD SEE ANY CHANCE FOR ESCAPE
THEIR DUTY THEN WAS EVIDENT
IN CASE THE GOODS ARRIVE HERE I SHALL HOPE TO SEE YOUR LONG-TALKED OF PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMAN IN WASHINGTON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
HE DID NOT FLOG BUT WOULD NOT GIVE A SLAVE A CENT OF MONEY UPON ANY CONSIDERATION IT WAS BY PROCURING A PASS TO NORFOLK THAT HENRY MANAGED TO ESCAPE
THE PARTY WENT TO BALTIMORE AND SUCH WAS THE EXCITEMENT THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED UNSAFE FOR THE PARTY TO GO OUT IN A BODY IN DAY-TIME
I OUGHT TO SAY THAT I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THERE WERE GOOD REASONS FOR THE P
NO IDEA OTHER THAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM THEIR MOTHER EVER ENTERED THEIR MINDS
CHEERS LEWIS TAPPAN WAS ONE OF THE WARMEST FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE AND OF THE COLORED MAN
BUT THIS PLACE WAS NOT CANADA SO WHEN IT WAS DEEMED BEST SHE WAS SENT ON
BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT ANY OF THESE REPRESENT THE SENTIMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND IT WOULD BE TO WRONG OUR PEOPLE SORELY TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY OF PERSONAL SOCIAL OR POLITICAL MORALS
FURTHERMORE THAT DAVID ALLEGED THAT HE WAS INDUCED TO ESCAPE BECAUSE HE THE COACHMAKER WAS A VERY HARD MAN WHO TOOK EVERY DOLLAR OF HIS EARNINGS FROM WHICH HE WOULD DOLE OUT TO HIM ONLY ONE DOLLAR A WEEK FOR BOARD ETC A SUM LESS THAN DAVID COULD MANAGE TO GET ALONG WITH
ALTHOUGH THIS WAS MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH S.D
THE WIFE OF HIS BOSOM AND HIS FOUR CHILDREN ONLY FIVE DAYS BEFORE HE FLED WERE SOLD TO A TRADER IN RICHMOND VA FOR NO OTHER OFFENCE THAN SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAD RESISTED THE LUSTFUL DESIGNS OF HER MASTER BEING TRUE TO HER OWN COMPANION AFTER THIS POOR SLAVE MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN WERE CAST INTO PRISON FOR SALE THE HUSBAND AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS TRIED HARD TO FIND A PURCHASER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
NEVERTHELESS THE TWO SUBJOINED WILL IN A MEASURE SUFFICE TO GIVE SOME IDEA OF HIS INTELLIGENCE ETC
JIM WHO ACCOMPANIED PERRY BROUGHT THE SHOE-MAKING ART WITH HIM
HE STATED AS THE CAUSE OF HIS FLIGHT THAT WILLIAM CAMPBELL HAD OPPRESSED HIM AND KEPT HIM CLOSELY AT HARD LABOR WITHOUT PAYING HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME DID NOT GIVE HIM HALF ENOUGH TO EAT AND NO CLOTHING JOHN ALEXANDER WAS ABOUT FORTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE A MAN OF ORDINARY SIZE QUITE BLACK AND A GOOD SPECIMEN OF A REGULAR CORN-FIELD HAND
IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE CONCLUDED THAT NOTHING WOULD AFFORD HIM MORE PLEASURE BEFORE LEAVING THAN TO SPEND HIS LAST HOURS AT THE WASH HOUSE UNDER THE FLOOR TO THIS PLACE HE WENT WITH NO FEAR OF HUNTERS BEFORE HIS EYES
NO FURTHER KNOWLEDGE OF THEM DID HE POSSESS
WHAT PUT IT INTO YOUR HEAD TO LEAVE WAS THE THIRD QUERY
A SLIGHT ATTEMPT AT APPLAUSE IN THE COURT ROOM WAS PROMPTLY SUPPRESSED
THE SYMPATHY WHICH CHARACTERIZED HER ACTIONS IS CLEARLY EVINCED IN HER OWN WORDS AS CONTAINED IN THE APPENDED EXTRACTS FROM HER LETTER AS FOLLOWS

FLEEING GIRL OF FIFTEEN IN MALE ATTIRE
BORN A QUAKER HE HELD WITH SIMPLE TRUST THE FAITH OF THE SOCIETY THAT GOD MOVES AND INSPIRES MEN TO DO THE WORK HE REQUIRES OF THEIR HANDS AND THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE HE NEVER WAVERED IN HIS CONVICTION THAT HIS FATHER HAD CALLED HIM TO WORK IN THE CAUSE TO WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD IF TAKEN IN A FREE STATE

BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE MELTED ME AS THE FIRST SIGHT OF FREE LAND
PETER AND LEVIN COULD HAVE DONE SO I THINK IF THEY HAD HAD RESOLUTION
THE TIME AND ATTENTION REQUIRED FOR SO MANY LEFT BUT LITTLE OPPORTUNITY HOWEVER FOR THE SECRETARY TO WRITE THEIR NARRATIVES
THIS PERHAPS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A FAIR AVERAGE OF THE AMOUNT OF LABOR WHICH HE CONSTANTLY EXPENDED IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF HIS BENEVOLENT EFFORTS
GRAHAM GEO AND WIFE JANE 337
CLARISSA DAVIS

AND HE HAS NEVER ASCERTAINED TO THIS DAY HOW IT WAS THAT HE WAS LEFT ALIVE ON THE EARTH TO CARRY ON HIS GREAT WORK
OWINGS AND AS HIS ADVERTISEMENT WAS OF THE SAME LIBERALITY AND HIGH TONE IT SEEMS BUT FITTING THAT IT SHOULD COME IN JUST HERE TO GIVE WEIGHT AND COMPLETENESS TO THE STORY

ROYAN WM 391
MY TWO BROTHERS RAN AWAY BROOKS AND LAWRENCE BUT WHERE THEY WENT I CAN'T TELL BUT WOULD BE PLEASED TO KNOW
IT IS SELDOM A VOLUME IS SEEN WHICH SO ABOUNDS IN APT AND STRIKING ILLUSTRATION

I LEFT MY WIFE AND ONE CHILD
IT HARDLY NEED BE HINTED THAT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE FIERYS LIVED WAS DEEPLY AGITATED FOR DAYS AFTER AS INDEED IT WAS ALONG THE ENTIRE ROUTE TO CHAMBERSBURG IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BOLD AND SUCCESSFUL MOVEMENT
DURING THIS TIME THE INFANT OF THE RESPONDENT WAS ENTRUSTED TO ANOTHER COLORED WOMAN
TORONTO CANADA WEST UPPER 18TH DAY OF THE 9TH MO 1856
AND WHO BEING FRIGHTENED AT THEIR APPROACH RAN AND HID HIMSELF
ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE JAIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE SHERIFF WAS AROUSED AND THE COMMITMENT SHOWN TO HIM
IN FINDING HIMSELF ON FREE GROUND HOWEVER WITH CHEERING PROSPECTS AHEAD HE DID NOT STOP TO BROOD OVER THE ILLS THAT HE HAD SUFFERED BUT REJOICED HEARTILY
THAT ALL TRACES OF THESE HEROES MIGHT NOT BE LOST A MERE FRAGMENT IS ALL THAT WAS PRESERVED
AT LEAST NOTHING OF THE KIND IS FOUND ON THE RECORD BOOK
I ARRIVED HERE LAST TUESDAY A WEEK
THE PHILADELPHIA BRANCH OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS NOT FORTUNATE IN HAVING VERY FREQUENT ARRIVALS FROM NORTH CAROLINA
AND IF IT IS TRUE OF OTHERS WHOM I DID NOT KNOW THEN TO THEIR MEMORY ALSO I BEAR THIS RECORD OF THE TWO WHOSE LABORS AND CHARACTERS IT HAS BEEN THE DEEPEST PRIVILEGE OF MY LIFE TO KNOW SO WELL AH HOW HIS COURSE SO DIFFERENT PROVES TO US THAT THE TRUE SCHOLAR IS ALWAYS A SCHOLAR OF TRUTH
ON THE 12TH OF MARCH HE RAN AWAY FROM MACON AND WENT TO SAVANNAH

NOVEMBER 2D 1853.--ARRIVED
HER MANNER IS MARKED BY DIGNITY AND COMPOSURE
I AM IN GOOD HEALTH AND GOOD SPIRITS AND FEELES REJOICED IN THE LORD FOR MY LIBERTY
THIS WAS WHAT PROMPTED THEM TO FLEE
DARKLY UPON OUR STRUGGLING WAY THE STORM OF HUMAN HATE IS SWEEPING
THE ESCAPE OF A DENTIST ON THE U.G.R.R
HE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY MET THE SAME PARTIES WHO WITH CONTEMPTIBLE HYPOCRISY TREATED THE NIGGER WITH GREAT RESPECT
SHE WOULD WHIP CONTRARY TO HIS ORDERS WHO WAS YOUR FATHER WAS FURTHER INQUIRED
BUT THE BOAT FOR WHICH I WAS WAITING CAME DOWN ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING
IN SLAVERY HE HAD BEEN PRESSED HARD HIS HIRE TEN DOLLARS PER MONTH HE WAS OBLIGED TO PRODUCE AT THE END OF EACH MONTH NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO EXPEND FOR DOCTOR BILLS C THE WOMAN HE CALLED MISTRESS WENT BY THE NAME OF ANN COLLEY A WIDOW LIVING NEAR PETERSBURG
GREAT AS WAS HIS DANGER WHEN THE STEAMER RETURNED TO NORFOLK HE WAS SAFELY GOTTEN OFF THE BOAT AND UNDER THE EYE OF OFFICERS WALKED AWAY
IN GIVING THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS OF LUCRETIA MOTT'S LIFE WE PREFER TO USE HER OWN LANGUAGE WHENEVER POSSIBLE
BUT WHERE THAT COULD BE IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE
SO AT THE COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN HE WAS READY TO BEAR HIS PART OF THE SUFFERING CONSEQUENT UPON BEING CONCEALED IN THE HOLD OF A VESSEL WHERE BUT LITTLE AIR COULD PENETRATE
CHARLES BROWN WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK AND BORE THE MARKS OF HAVING BEEN USED HARD THOUGH HIS STOUT AND HEARTY APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM VERY DESIRABLE TO A TRADER
HARRED
FOR SHE HAD ADOPTED THE VERY DOCTRINE FOR WHICH SHE IMPRISONED ME AND GIVEN IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL EMANCIPATION TO HER EIGHTY THOUSAND SLAVES
BUT ZECHARIAH HAD NO COMPASSION ON HER WHATEVER BUT INSISTED THAT SHE WAS A HARD MISTRESS
IN 1853
ALTHOUGH THESE TRAVELERS WERE OF THE FIELD HAND CLASS WHO HAD NEVER BEEN PERMITTED TO SEE MUCH OFF OF THE FARM AND HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HEARING INTELLIGENT PEOPLE TALK YET THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM SO NATURAL TO MAN WAS QUITE UPPERMOST WITH ALL OF THEM
THE ROOM WAS EXCEEDINGLY LIMITED BUT HE STOOD IT BRAVELY
THEY ARE HERE GIVEN AS FOLLOWS
THERE WAS BUT LITTLE ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENT AMONG THE WHITES YET THERE WERE MANY STRONG AND VALIANT FRIENDS AMONG THEM WHO CONTRIBUTED FREELY
AS A MASTER WOODHOUSE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE OF THE MODERATE TYPE ACCORDING TO STEWART'S JUDGMENT

HE MIGHT CARRY WOOD OYSTERS C AND ALL HIS CUSTOMERS FROM THIS VICINITY MIGHT TRAVEL IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT ANY OF THE SUSPICIONS THAT MIGHT ATTEND THEIR JOURNEYINGS TOWARDS THIS CITY
LEWIS WHO WERE AMONG THE MOST FAITHFUL DEVOTED AND QUIETLY EFFICIENT WORKERS IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE INCLUDING THAT DEPARTMENT OF IT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS VOLUME
IF ONE OR TWO SAFE STOPPING-PLACES COULD BE FOUND ON THE WAY--SUCH AS A BARN OR SHED THEY COULD WALK QUITE SAFELY ALL NIGHT AND THEN SLEEP ALL DAY--ABOUT TWO OR EASILY THREE NIGHTS WOULD CONVEY THEM TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
FUSSELL AND AFTER HIM HIS BROTHER WILLIAM LIVED ON FARMS ADJOINING THEIRS AND WERE THEIR ACTIVE HELPERS IN THIS WORK
HE DON'T TREAT THEM WELL NO WAY REPLIED THE PASSENGER
AND YET EVEN IN SOME OF THOSE LOWLY HOMES I MET WITH HOSPITALITY
I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT GOING TO LIBERIA WHEN I SAW YOU LAST AND DID INTEND TO START THIS FALL BUT I SINCE LOOKED AT THE CONDITION OF THE COLORED PEOPLE IN CANADA
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD IF TAKEN IN THIS COUNTY OR ONE-HALF OF WHAT SHE SELLS FOR IF TAKEN OUT OF THE COUNTY OR STATE
HE RECOGNIZED ME AS HIS SON AND PROTECTED ME AS FAR AS HE WAS ALLOWED SO TO DO
BUT I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN MORE THAN I INTENDED
CONSEQUENTLY AS MY WOUNDS HEALED AND MY SENSES CAME TO ME I BEGAN TO PLAN HOW TO MAKE ANOTHER EFFORT TO ESCAPE
IN REFLECTING UPON THE MATTER IT OCCURRED TO THE DOCTOR THAT IN EARLIER DAYS HE HAD BEEN QUITE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH A FARMER AND HIS FAMILY WHO WERE SLAVE-HOLDERS IN MARYLAND AND THAT HE WOULD ABOUT REACH THEIR HOUSE AT THE END OF THE FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY

JONES THOS ALIAS ROBT
LAST THOUGH NOT LEAST AT THE RISK OF WOUNDING THE FEELINGS OF ONE WHO PREFERRED NOT TO LET THE LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND DOETH WE MAY CONTEMPLATE THE PHILANTHROPIC LABORS OF ONE WHOSE GENEROSITY AND BENEVOLENCE KNEW NO BOUNDS
SHE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK AND SPARE STRUCTURE
1 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THAT IT SHALL NOT BE LAWFUL FOR ANY VESSEL OF ANY SIZE OR DESCRIPTION WHATEVER OWNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY CITIZEN OR RESIDENT OF ANOTHER STATE AND ABOUT TO SAIL OR STEAM FOR ANY PORT OR PLACE IN THIS STATE FOR ANY PORT OR PLACE NORTH OF AND BEYOND THE CAPES OF VIRGINIA TO DEPART FROM THE WATERS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH UNTIL SAID VESSEL HAS UNDERGONE THE INSPECTION HEREINAFTER PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ACT AND RECEIVED A CERTIFICATE TO THAT EFFECT
ON THE 24TH INST THOMAS GARRETT IN HIS EIGHTY-SECOND YEAR PASSED ON TO THE HIGHER LIFE
MY MISTRESS WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIVED ON A FARM
SHE WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT HAD NEVER KNOWN PERSONAL ABUSE AS A SLAVE
AS TO TRAVELING BY NIGHT OR DAY HE WAS ALWAYS ROAD-READY AND HAVING AN UNCOMMON MEMORY COULD GIVE EXCEEDINGLY GOOD ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HE SAW ETC
HIS LOT IN SLAVERY HAD BEEN CAST UNDER SAMUEL JARMAN BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN BADLY TREATED
BURKETT
FOR SOME CAUSE OR OTHER THE ALARM OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK WAS SOUNDED IN HIS EARS WHICH AT FIRST DISTRACTED HIM GREATLY
A SMILE SEEMED TO PLAY UPON THE DEAD LIPS
THE MAN WHO HAD HABITUALLY ROBBED HIM OF HIS HIRE WAS A STOUT-BUILT ILL-NATURED MAN A FARMER BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM HYSON
UPON THE WHOLE HE SAID HE HAD BEEN TREATED PRETTY WELL
I SAW HIM AT MY ROOM THE NEXT MORNING
GET THEIR DESCRIPTION SAID MR W
ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED WERE THEN TAKEN BY THE OFFICERS BEFORE AN ALDERMAN
BRAVELY WITH HER FOUR LITTLE ONES WITH FIRM FAITH IN GOD AND AN ARDENT DESIRE TO BE FREE SHE FORSOOK THE PRISON-HOUSE AND SUCCEEDED THROUGH THE AID OF MY FATHER TO REACH A FREE STATE
I FEAR THEY WILL BE TAKEN
LEWIS WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH WORKING JAMES HARD AND KEEPING ALL HIS EARNINGS BUT WOULD INSOLENTLY TALK OCCASIONALLY OF HANDING HIM OVER TO THE TRADER THIS STIRRED JAMES BLOOD AND AROUSED HIS COURAGE TO THE STICKING POINT NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO REMAIN

BUT SCARCELY WOULD ONE POOR FELLOW PASS THREE MINUTES BEING THUS REFRESHED ERE THE OTHERS WOULD INSIST THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO HIS HOLE AIR WAS PRECIOUS BUT FOR THE TIME BEING THEY VALUED THEIR LIBERTY AT STILL GREATER PRICE
AND IT MAY SAFELY BE SAID FROM A TRUER AND MORE DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE SLAVE THEY COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED COUNSEL
ON THEIR ARRIVAL THEY NATURALLY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HURRIED THEM OFF TO PHILADELPHIA APPRISING THE COMMITTEE THERE OF THEIR APPROACH BY A DISPATCH SENT AHEAD
HER INTENDED'S MOTHER WHO WAS A FREE WOMAN AGREED TO COME AS A PASSENGER ON THE SAME BOAT
THE WRITER HAS HEARD MEN PREACH THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRIFLING VALUE OF THE THINGS OF A PRESENT TIME AND OF THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF THOSE OF A NEVER-ENDING ETERNITY BUT DANIEL GIBBONS IS THE ONLY PERSON SHE EVER KNEW WHO LIVED THAT DOCTRINE
YOU MENTIONED IF I SAW MR FOREMAN
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE COLORED MAN WILL VOTE BUT PERHAPS MANY OF THEM WILL BE INTIMIDATED AT THE POLLS FROM A LETTER DATED CHERAW JUNE 17TH 1867 THE FOLLOWING REMARKS ARE TAKEN
THIS THREAT WAS VERY ANNOYING TO LEWIS SO MUCH SO THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY LET HER SEE THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED IT WAS EASIER TO TALK OF SELLING THAN IT WOULD BE TO CARRY OUT HER THREAT
THE LADY IS PERFECTLY SAFE NOW IN CANADA
IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER A REWARD OF $3,000 WAS OFFERED FOR THEIR ARREST
HE HAS A MOTHER LIVING IN WASHINGTON CITY ON SOUTH B STREET NO
WILLIAM WAS PAINED WITH THE IDEA THAT SO MUCH OF HIS TIME HAD ALREADY BEEN USED UP AS HE WAS THEN THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE
MOTHER AND CHILDREN APPEALED LOUDLY FOR SYMPATHY
I SAY WE WE OF THESE FREE NORTHERN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT IS BY OUR ALLOWANCE SIGNIFIED AS EFFECTUALLY BY SILENCE AS BY ACTIVE CO-OPERATION THAT SUCH THINGS ARE
IN SPEAKING OF THE GOOD TREATMENT HE HAD ALWAYS MET WITH A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE REMARKED YOU MUST BE AKIN TO SOME ONE OF YOUR MASTER'S FAMILY TO WHICH HE REPLIED I AM CHRISTIAN'S SON UNQUESTIONABLY THIS PASSENGER WAS ONE OF THAT HAPPY CLASS SO COMMONLY REFERRED TO BY APOLOGISTS FOR THE PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION THE COMMITTEE FEELING A DEEP INTEREST IN HIS STORY AND DESIRING GREAT SUCCESS TO HIM IN HIS UNDERGROUND EFFORTS TO GET RID OF SLAVERY AND AT THE SAME TIME POSSESS HIMSELF OF HIS AFFIANCED MADE HIM HEARTILY WELCOME FEELING ASSURED THAT THE STRUGGLES AND HARDSHIPS HE HAD SUBMITTED TO IN ESCAPING AS WELL AS THE LUXURIES HE WAS LEAVING BEHIND WERE NOTHING TO BE COMPARED WITH THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY AND A FREE WIFE IN CANADA

BUT WE MUST ALL DIE MY FRIENDS AND THE DYING HOUR IS NOT FAR DISTANT FROM THE YOUNGEST OF US
HE TOOK LEAVE OF BOSTON IN THE FALL OF 1829 AFTER HAVING ACTED AS THE ORATOR OF THE DAY JULY 4TH IN PARK STREET CHURCH AND SURPRISED HIS HEARERS BY THE BOLDNESS OF HIS UTTERANCES ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
AND SINCE HIS MASTER HAD THREATENED HIM HE LOOKED UPON HIM AS HIS GREATEST ENEMY AND RATHER THAN CONTINUE A SLAVE HE PREFERRED LIVING IN THE SWAMPS WITH WILD ANIMALS
I HAVE BEEN TO A HOUSE WHERE I HEARD HE LIVED
IN LOOKING BACK NO DOUBT TO THE CONTEST WHICH WAS MAINTAINED IN THIS COUNTRY SOME THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO AGAINST SLAVERY IN OUR COLONIES WE MAY RECOLLECT THAT CLARKSON AND WILBERFORCE WERE DENOUNCED AS FANATICS AND HAD TO ENCOUNTER MUCH OPPROBRIUM
ANDREW ANOTHER FELLOW-PASSENGER WAS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE AND A DECIDEDLY INVITING-LOOKING SPECIMEN OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE PHILADELPHIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY WHICH WAS FORMED THROUGH MUCH OPPOSITION IN 1835 AND HE STEADILY ADHERED TO ITS MEETINGS NOTWITHSTANDING THE THREATS WHICH WERE SO LOUDLY MADE BY THE ENEMIES OF PUBLIC ORDER
PENN LATELY WROTE TO MR WRIGHT SAYING HE WOULD PAY $300 TO HAVE THIS SERVICE PERFORMED

CHAMBERS JOHN 334
THE HORRORS OF THE INTERNAL SLAVE-TRADE MORE WIDELY DEMORALIZING IN MY OPINION THAN THE FOREIGN SLAVE-TRADE ITSELF
I HAD TO RESIST AND SHE GOT THE WORST OF IT THAT TIME ALL THAT MAY NOW BE ADDED IS THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG SLAVE GIRLS SHAMEFULLY EXPOSED TO THE BASE LUSTS OF THEIR MASTERS AS NANCY WAS--TRULY WAS LEGION
THEY WOULD WRITE BACK CONTINUALLY EITHER TO THEIR FRIENDS IN THE NORTH OR SOUTH HOPING THUS TO PROCURE THEM

CRAIN
IT MAKES ONE ASHAMED AS WELL AS SAD TO READ SUCH THINGS THAT HUMAN BEINGS OR ANY OTHER BEINGS SHOULD BE SO TREATED
HEAR HEAR AS REGARDS THE CAUSE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT THE CAUSE OF NEGRO EMANCIPATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS BEEN THE GREATEST CAUSE WHICH IN ANCIENT OR IN MODERN TIMES HAS BEEN PLEADED AT THE BAR OF THE MORAL JUDGMENT OF MANKIND
HERE SHE WAS INTRODUCED TO A LARGE AUDIENCE OF COLORED PEOPLE WHO HAILED HER APPEARANCE WITH LIVELY JOY
ADAM WAS WELL DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT TAKEN FROM THE BALTIMORE SUN
TO ASCERTAIN THIS FACT REQUIRED NO LITTLE ADDRESS
BUT IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS IMAGINATION HE NEVER DREAMED THAT THIS VISIT WAS TO BE MADE THE MEANS OF HIS DESTRUCTION
BUT THIS LITTLE EPISODE WAS NOT A MATTER TO EXCITE SYMPATHY IN THE BREASTS OF THE HIGHLY REFINED AND TENDER-HEARTED CHRISTIAN MOTHERS OF PETERSBURG
THE TWO FRIENDS TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER AND ADOPTED THE POLICY FROM WHICH THENCEFORWARD NEITHER EVER SWERVED
STILL ENDED IN HIS ACQUITTAL
HE THANKED GOD FOR THE WORKS OF THIS MAN

THESE ACTS WERE MADE THE SUBJECT OF A CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY OF THIS COURT IN NOVEMBER LAST OF WHICH I SHALL DIRECT A COPY TO BE LAID BEFORE YOU
THAT HE NO LONGER WOULD OBEY THE BIDDING OF A MASTER AND THAT HE WOULD DIE RATHER THAN BE A SLAVE
UNTIL HOWEVER SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT HER TWO CHILDREN WERE TO BE SOLD SHE COULD NOT QUITE MUSTER COURAGE TO SET OUT ON THE JOURNEY
CULTURE IS A HOLY WORD AND DARE BE USED OF INTELLECTUAL ADVANCE ONLY WHEN THE MORAL SYMPATHIES HAVE KEPT EQUAL STEP
AS A SLAVE SUBJECTED TO THE WHIMS AND PASSIONS OF HIS MASTER HENRY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD NOT STAND IT LONGER
HER MOST REMARKABLE TRAITS OF CHARACTER WERE AN INTENSE HATRED OF OPPRESSION IN ALL ITS FORMS A CORRESPONDING LOVE FOR THE OPPRESSED AN UNTIRING DEVOTION TO THEIR WELFARE AND A COURAGE THAT NEVER QUAILED BEFORE ANY OBSTACLES HOWEVER FORMIDABLE
HIS AGED MOTHER HE HAD TO LEAVE ALSO
IN THIS MANNER THEY MADE GOOD TIME REACHED CHAMBERSBURG SAFELY AND VENTURED UP TO A HOTEL WHERE THEY PUT UP THEIR HORSES
THEIR NAMES ARE CHARLES AND PATRICK AND ARE LIVING WITH MRS JOSEPH G

CONSEQUENTLY THROUGH THIS DEPLORABLE FAILURE SAMUEL A
STANTON PHILLIP 524
SLAVEHOLDERS WOULD ON SOME SUCH OCCASIONS SHOW WONDERFUL LIBERALITY IN LETTING THEIR OLD SLAVES GO FREE WHEN THEY COULD WORK NO MORE
YET IN ORDER TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS MISERABLE LIFE HE WAS WILLING AS HE DECLARED TO SUFFER ALMOST ANY SACRIFICE
IN VIEW OF HIS PROSPECTS IN CANADA LEWIS SOUL OVERFLOWED WITH PLEASING ANTICIPATIONS OF FREEDOM AND THE COMMITTEE FELT GREAT SATISFACTION IN ASSISTING HIM
I EXPECT YOU MY WIFE LEA ANN BLOCKSON MY SON ALEXANDER LEWIS AND AMES WILL ALL BE HERE AND ISABELLA ALSO IF YOU CANT BRING ALL BRING ALEXANDER SURELY WRITE WHEN YOU WILL COME AND I WILL MEET YOU IN ALBANY

HIS CONVICTIONS ON THE SUBJECT WERE VERY EARNEST
THEN I TOLD HIM OF MY MASTER'S WRITING TO MRS CARROLL CONCERNING SELLING ETC AND THAT I WAS GOING OFF TOO
THERE WERE THE SERENEST SKIES ABOVE THEM--HEAVEN'S LOVE PERPETUALLY SHINING
ALL WAS QUIET
HE THOUGHT THAT THIS DECISION MIGHT BE THE TURNING CASE TO SHOW WHETHER THE ACT OF CONGRESS WOULD BE CARRIED OUT OR WHETHER WE WERE TO RETURN IN FACT TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS UNDER THE OLD LAWS
BUT MY WIFE HAD VERY BAD LUCK

JOSEPH KNEELAND ARRIVED NOVEMBER 25 1853
IT MADE THEM QUITE SURE THAT THERE WAS PLUCK AND BRAIN SOMEWHERE
SHE HAD WON THEIR AFFECTIONS COMPLETELY AND SHE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THEIR INFLUENCE HAD SAVED HER FROM SEVERE PUNISHMENT
IN THIS MANNER THEY HAD DETERMINED TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DEATH FOR LIBERTY
THEY ARE FOR PUTTING MEN OF ANTI-SLAVERY PRINCIPLES IN OFFICE
AFTER MUCH PERSUASION WE CONSENTED TO GO WITH HIM
JAMES AND DAVID GREEN JOHN HENRY AND JONATHAN FISHER
GEORGE THOUGHT HOWEVER AGREEABLE TO HER IT MIGHT NOT BE TO HIM
YOU SHALL NOT HAVE THE CONTROLLING POWER IN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT AT HOME AND ABROAD

OR IF YOU CAN SEND ME WORD WHERE THEY ARE I WILL ENDEAVOR TO WRITE TO THEM FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
HE LEFT PHILADELPHIA ON THE 15TH OF SEPTEMBER 1851 AND WENT TO HARRISBURG INTENDING TO GO TO HOLLIDAYSBURG
THEY LAUGHED AT ME AND SAID NO SUCH THOUGHT HAD ENTERED THEIR HEADS THAT I WAS TO BE FREE
HE IS ONE OF OUR MOST EFFICIENT AIDS ON THE RAIL ROAD AND WORTHY OF FULL CONFIDENCE
HE HAD EXPERIENCED ROUGH USAGE ALL THE WAY ALONG THROUGH LIFE NOT UNFREQUENTLY FROM SEVERE FLOGGINGS
I CANNOT SAY ANY MORE AT THIS TIME
I SHOULD NOT DARE TO TRUST MY MEMORY FOR THE NUMBER OF FUGITIVE SLAVES THIS BRAVE OLD FRIEND HAS HELPED TO SAFETY AND FREEDOM--NEARLY THREE THOUSAND I BELIEVE
JAMES HAMLET WAS THE FIRST SLAVE CASE WHO WAS SUMMARILY ARRESTED UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW AND SENT BACK TO BONDAGE FROM NEW YORK

I AM LENDING PETER STILL--THE BOOK--TO MY NEIGHBORS
SINCE THE SALE OF CAROLINE'S BROTHER AND SISTER JUST REFERRED TO HER MOTHER AND THREE CHILDREN HAD MADE GOOD THEIR EXIT TO CANADA HAVING BEEN EVIDENTLY PROMPTED BY SAID SALE
BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT DR MARTIN WAS OPPOSED TO SAM'S LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE
AS THE RESULT ON MOTION OF THOMAS WEBSTER ESQ A MOVEMENT WAS SET ON FOOT WHICH LED TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PHILADELPHIA SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE SUBSEQUENT ESTABLISHMENT OF CAMP WILLIAM PENN WITH THE ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL ARMY OF ELEVEN COLORED REGIMENTS
IMMEDIATELY WE FOUND THAT THE PRIVILEGES OF INDEPENDENT LABOR WERE OPEN TO THEM SCHOOLS WERE ESTABLISHED IN WHICH THEIR SONS MIGHT OBTAIN AN EDUCATION THAT WOULD RAISE THEM TO AN INTELLECTUAL POSITION NEVER REACHED BY THEIR FATHERS
AND WHOSE EARS WILL NOT BE MADE TO TINGLE WHEN THE GOD OF SABAOTH AWAKES TO PLEAD THE CAUSE OF THE DUMB

HE LIVES AND WILL LIVE FOR EVER IN MANY HEARTS AND IN THE HEAVEN OF HEAVENS ABOVE
AND POOR CONCKLIN
THE DEPUTY MARSHAL LIKEWISE CONSIDERED THE BUSINESS OF CATCHING SLAVES VERY UNSAFE
HIS HEAD AND CHEST AND INDEED HIS ENTIRE STRUCTURE AS SOLID AS A ROCK INDICATED THAT HE WAS PHYSICALLY NO ORDINARY MAN
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND A FAIR SPECIMEN OF A STOUT MAN POSSESSED OF MORE THAN ORDINARY PHYSICAL STRENGTH
MARY EPPS ALIAS EMMA BROWN JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON
ESTEEMED FRIENDS J.M
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE
HE DECLARED THAT HE STUCK TO THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD GEORGE E
HE GAVE HIS EXPERIENCE OF SLAVERY PRETTY FULLY AND THE COMMITTEE ENLIGHTENED HIM AS TO THE WORKINGS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THE VALUE OF FREEDOM AND THE SAFETY OF CANADA AS A REFUGE
WHILE ALL THE NAMES OF THESE PASSENGERS WERE DULY ENTERED ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORDS THE NUMBER WAS TOO LARGE AND THE TIME THEY SPENT WITH THE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE WERE MADE BY DANIEL AFTER BEING SOLD TO NORTH CAROLINA
AND PARTICULARLY WOULD HER THOUGHTS DWELL UPON HER BOY SIX YEARS OF AGE
SIMS SAMUEL 208
ERE LONG THE OPPORTUNITY OF AN INTERVIEW WAS HAD AND PETER GAVE SETH A VERY FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY AND OF HIS FAMILY AND MADE KNOWN TO HIM THAT HE HAD VERY CAREFULLY GONE OVER WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN THE MATTER OF THEIR FREEDOM

STILL DEAR SIR:--I FEEL MYSELF QUITE LONESOME THIS EVENING AND NOT HEARING FROM YOU LATELY I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DROP YOU A FEW LINES
I LEFT FOR NO OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY TO GET MY LIBERTY THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE YET HE HAD TOO MUCH SENSE TO CONTINUE IN SUCH A LIFE IN PREFERENCE TO FREEDOM
DOUBTLESS THE LARGE SUMS THUS OFFERED AWAKENED A LIVELY FEELING IN THE BREASTS OF OLD SLAVE-HUNTERS
HARRIET FELT THAT HER CHANCES FOR THE FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF SUCH A BRUTAL MASTER COULD NOT BE OTHER THAN MISERABLE
PLEASE DIRECT THE LETTER FOR MY WIFE TO MR GEORGE LISTER IN HILL STREET BETWEEN HOWARD AND SHARP
WITH JOHN'S INTELLIGENCE LARGE OBSERVATION GOOD MEMORY AND EXCELLENT NATURAL ABILITIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT HE POSSESSED NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR A THRILLING BOOK THAN THE FACTS AND INCIDENTS OF SLAVE LIFE AS HE HAD BEEN CONVERSANT WITH IT UNDER THE JOHNSONS IN MARYLAND
HIS WHOLE SET SAID MR BROWN
MCCAULLY BORE THE NAME OF COMING BY FREE COLORED CHILDREN WITHOUT BUYING THEM AND SELLING THEM AFTERWARDS
THOSE WHOSE GRIEFS HE HAS FREQUENTLY SOFTENED HAVE LAID UPON HIS HEAD A CROWN OF BLESSING WHITER THAN THE HONORS WHICH COME WITH HIS SILVER HAIRS AND ALL WITH WHOM HE COMES IN CONTACT IN BUSINESS IN DUTY OR IN SOCIAL INTERCOURSE ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE THE WIDE USEFULNESS AND INFLUENCE OF THE UPRIGHT MAN

THE COUNSEL FOR THE PRISONERS WHO WERE AWARE OF HIS MOVEMENTS PROCEEDED WITH THE EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME FOR PROCURING THIS IMPORTANT LINK IN THE CHAIN OF TESTIMONY AND THUS TO PROCRASTINATE THE PERIOD WHEN THEY SHOULD BE CALLED UPON TO SUM UP THE CASE
CLEVELAND PROF CHAS
JIM THEREFORE CONCLUDED TO THROW HIMSELF UPON THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMITTEE AND TAKE AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TICKET AND THEREBY SPARE HIMSELF AND HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS THE DISAGREEABLENESS OF MEETING UNDER SUCH STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES
TREASON AT CHRISTIANA WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT
PEARSON NOT CONTENTED WITH HIS PREVIOUS INFAMY WAS ON HAND
HE WAS NOT YET QUITE TWENTY-ONE BUT WAS WIDE-AWAKE AND IT APPEARED FROM HIS CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD DONE SOME CLOSE THINKING BEFORE HE STARTED FOR FREEDOM
NONE SYMPATHIZED WITH THEM MORE SINCERELY OR SHOWED A GREATER WILLINGNESS TO RENDER THEM MATERIAL AID
IT WAS ONLY KNOWN THAT WATSON FREEMAN ESQ WHO ONCE DECLARED HIS READINESS TO HANG ANY NUMBER OF NEGROES REMARKABLY CHEAP CAME IN SAYING THAT THE ARREST WAS A SHAME ALL A HUMBUG THE TRICK OF THE DAMNED ABOLITIONISTS AND PROCLAIMED HIS READINESS TO STAND BAIL

CATHARINES C.W JUNE 28TH 1855
MCCRACKEN WHO HAD TREATED HIM BAD AS THOMAS THOUGHT THAT SUCH TROUBLE AND BAD TREATMENT MIGHT BE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE HE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD BETTER GO AWAY AND LET MCCRACKEN GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO FILL HIS PLACE IF HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FILL IT HIMSELF
THEY PASSED ON FROM NEAR PRINCETON WHERE I SAW THEM AND HAD A LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH THEM UP NORTH I THINK TWENTY-THREE MILES ABOVE VINCENNES IND WHERE THEY WERE SEIZED BY A PARTY OF MEN AND LODGED IN JAIL
IN VERY DESPERATE STRAITS MANY NEW INVENTIONS WERE SOUGHT AFTER BY DEEP-THINKING AND RESOLUTE SLAVES DETERMINED TO BE FREE AT ANY COST
BUT WHEN THE DARK TIME WAS PASSED THE CLEARNESS THAT DEFINED THEIR SENTIMENTS WAS SEEN TO BE WORTH ALL THE PERSONAL DANGER THAT HAD BOUGHT IT
THE MOTHER AND HER SYMPATHIZERS ALL MOVED DOWN THE STAIRS TOGETHER IN THE PRESENCE OF QUITE A NUMBER OF SPECTATORS ON THE FIRST DECK AND ON THE WHARF ALL OF WHOM AS FAR AS I WAS ABLE TO DISCERN SEEMED TO LOOK UPON THE WHOLE AFFAIR WITH THE GREATEST INDIFFERENCE
GORHAM HENRY 379
AND SLAVE AUCTIONS WERE AS COMMON IN RICHMOND AS DRESS GOODS AUCTIONS IN PHILADELPHIA
LEWEY SARAH SAUNDERS SOPHIA GRAY HENRY GRAY MARY GRAY WINFIELD SCOTT AND THREE CHILDREN
BUT YET I SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT FURTHER TO SAY ABOUT HER THAN TO GIVE A VERY FEW WORDS OF TESTIMONY TO HER LIFE OF CEASELESS AND ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE ESPECIALLY TOWARD THE COLORED PEOPLE
AS A PARENT HE WAS NOT EXCESSIVELY INDULGENT AS A HUSBAND ONE MORE NEARLY A MODEL IS RARELY FOUND
HE WAS STRENGTHENED IN HIS COURSE BY A WARM FRIENDSHIP AND FREQUENT INTERCOURSE WITH THE LATE ABRAHAM L

IF YOU CAN THINK OF ANYTHING LET ME KNOW IT
THIS PARTY ARRIVED FROM SUSSEX COUNTY
THEN HE TOOK THE BLADE AND STOVE IT AT MY HEAD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
AS REGARDS HIS SLAVE LIFE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD NOT HAD IT VERY ROUGH AS A GENERAL THING
WE SHALL AWAIT HEARING FROM YOU
BUT GENERALLY TRADERS BEING WIDE AWAKE ON INSPECTING HIM WOULD ALMOST INVARIABLY PRONOUNCE HIM A D----N RASCAL BECAUSE HE WOULD NEVER FAIL TO EYE THEM STERNLY AS THEY INSPECTED HIM
ONE OF THEM SEEMED VERY MUCH IMPRESSED AND LABORED HARD TO CONVINCE HIS HOST THAT HE WAS A GOOD MASTER AND WOULD TREAT HIS MEN WELL
AND SHE HAS HELPED THAT MISTRESS AND SO HAS THE COLORED MAN GIVEN MONEY FROM WHAT I HEARD TO HIS FORMER MASTER
THE BLOW THAT SHE HAD THUS RECEIVED MADE HER ALMOST FRANTIC
I HAVE MAIL A PAPER FOR YOU TO DAY

I MIGHT BE SO GLAD IF IT WAS ONLY SO THAT I COULD GO HOME AMONG MY OWN KINDRED AND PEOPLE BUT SLAVERY COMES UP LIKE A DARK SHADOW BETWEEN ME AND THE HOME OF MY CHILDHOOD
THEY WERE PROVERBIALLY STINGY THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE CHRIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH
OCCASIONALLY JOHN SAID THE OLD MAN WOULD HAVE FAMILY PRAYERS AND TO USE JOHN'S OWN WORDS IN COMPANY HE WOULD TRY TO MORALIZE BUT OUT OF COMPANY WAS AS GREAT A ROWDY AS EVER WAS IN FURTHER DESCRIBING HIS OLD MASTER HE SAID THAT HE WAS A LARGE MAN WITH A RED FACE AND BLUNT NOSE AND WAS VERY QUICK AND FIERY IN HIS TEMPER
AND AGAIN SENT HER TO THE FIELD WITH ORDERS TO THE OVERSEER TO WHIP HER EVERY DAY AND MAKE HER WORK OR KILL HER AGAIN THE OVERSEER SAID IT WAS NO USE TO TRY FOR HER HEALTH WOULD NOT STAND IT AND SHE WAS FORTHWITH RETURNED
AT FIRST HE REFUSED TO SELL HIM
ALL MAY READ WHO WILL AND WHAT THEY WILL
ONE OF HIS LEGS WAS DRAWN UP SO THAT HE COULD NOT WALK WELL AND THEY OFFERED FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM WHICH HIS MASTER REFUSED
THANK GOD I EXCLAIMED WE ARE SAFE IN CANADA
A GREAT CHANGE WAS AT ONCE WROUGHT IN PETE'S MIND
WHO IS TO SAY WHETHER SOME OF THOSE QUIET TESTIMONIES MAY NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ERECT THAT MIGHTY MACHINERY THAT IS NOW ADDING TO ITS WHEELS AND SPRINGS FROM DAY TO DAY AND WHICH BIDS FAIR AT NO DISTANT PERIOD TO SUPERSEDE SLAVE LABOR AND ITS LONG TRAIN OF SORROW AND OPPRESSION
WITH REGARD TO GENTLEMANLY BEARING HOWEVER HE WAS ALL RIGHT IN THIS PARTICULAR
JIM WAS ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE WELL GROWN BLACK AND OF PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE
OF COURSE WHEN HE DID SUCCEED THE TRIUMPH WAS UNSPEAKABLY JOYOUS
I DON'T FIND MUCH TO DO I FIND THAT I HAVE NOT GOT A HARD MASTER TO DEAL WITH
HIS EXCUSE FOR RUNNING AWAY WAS ILL-TREATMENT IN TRAVELING NORTH HE WALKED TO COLUMBIA IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THERE TOOK THE CARS FOR PHILADELPHIA
THIS ROBERT DID AND JOHN AND TOM BROUGHT HIM BACK IN TRIUMPH
THOSE WHO KNOW HER NEED NOT BE TOLD THIS BUT THOSE WHO ONLY LOVE HER IN THE SPIRIT MAY BE SURE THAT THEY CAN HAVE NO FAITH TOO GREAT IN THE BEAUTY OF HER PURE AND CHRISTIAN LIFE
AT THE COMMAND OF HIS OWNER THE WEDDED RELATIONS WERE ABRUPTLY BROKEN AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO SEEK ANOTHER WIFE
WOULD BEAT THEM OVER THE HEAD WITH GREAT HICKORY STICKS THE SAME AS HE WOULD BEAT AN OX
CULVER NEXT ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE SHOWING THAT A GREAT INJUSTICE HAD BEEN DONE TO THE BROTHER OF DR PENNINGTON AND THOUGH HE UP TO THAT TIME HAD ADVOCATED PEACE HE NOW HAD THE SPIRIT TO TEAR DOWN THE BUILDING OVER THE MARSHAL'S HEAD
FAMILY FROM BALTIMORE
FAMILY FROM BALTIMORE
THE NECESSARY PAPERS DULY AUTHENTICATED BY THE GOVERNOR OR CHIEF JUSTICE OF DELAWARE WERE MISSING AND WITHOUT THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE OUT THE CASE

FAITHFULLY AND TRULY YOURS HIRAM WILSON
HERE ARE INTRODUCED A FEW OUT OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF INTERESTING LETTERS DESIGNED FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BOOK AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE
ROSS BENJ AND WIFE HARRIET 395
IT WAS 12 MONTHS AND 3 DAYS FROM THE TIME THAT I TOOK DEPARTURE OF MY WIFE AND CHILD TO PROCEED TO RICHMOND TO AWAITE A CONVEYANCE UP TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
ON ESCAPING HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BRING HIS WIFE HARRIET WITH HIM
I TO GO TO CINCINNATI TO GET A ROWING BOAT AND PROVISIONS
TO MEET THE EXPENSES OF AN EXTENSIVE BUILDING ENTERPRISE WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT HYSON WOULD HAVE TO SELL SOME OF HIS PROPERTY
IN ORDER TO BRING FULLY BEFORE THE READER THE BEGINNING OF THIS INTERESTING AND EXCITING CASE IT SEEMS ONLY NECESSARY TO PUBLISH THE SUBJOINED LETTER WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE ACTORS IN THE DRAMA AND ADDRESSED TO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE AND AN ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH WHICH MAY BE REQUISITE TO THROW LIGHT ON A SPECIAL POINT WHICH JUDGE KANE DECIDED WAS CONCEALED IN THE OBSTINATE BREAST OF PASSMORE WILLIAMSON AS SAID WILLIAMSON PERSISTENTLY REFUSED BEFORE THE SAID JUDGE'S COURT TO OWN THAT HE HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MYSTERY IN QUESTION
TO USE JANE'S OWN LANGUAGE HE WAS ON HER HEELS EVERY MINUTE FEARING THAT SOME ONE MIGHT GET TO HER EARS THE SWEET MUSIC OF FREEDOM
CANNDA WEST DEC
IT IS A SCHOOL AND THE TEACHER I BELIEVE IS PAID FROM THE SCHOOL FUND
HE FLED FROM JOHN BRYANT A FARMER
LET ME GIVE YOU A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THIS WEEK'S WORK
MANY A DARK NIGHT HE HAS SENT ME TO CARRY THEM VICTUALS AND CHANGE THEIR PLACES OF REFUGE AND TAKE THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE'S BARNS WHEN NOT SAFE FOR HIM TO GO
IN THE LIGHT OF THE EMANCIPATION AND THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT THEY ARE TOO TRANSPARENT TO NEED A SINGLE WORD OF COMMENT
HE SAW AND UNDERSTOOD THE EXTENT OF THE WRONGS UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED AND RESOLVED NOT TO ABIDE IN SUCH A CONDITION IF BY STRUGGLING AND PERSEVERANCE HE COULD AVOID IT
SEEING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE THE SAME THING THIS YEAR TOO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD MAKE MY ESCAPE TO CANADA I WOULD DO IT HE HAD STRONG PARENTAL AND KINDRED TIES TO BREAK BUT RESOLVED TO BREAK THEM RATHER THAN REMAIN UNDER MISS CORNWELL
SHE HAD A MISTRESS BUT WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HER--HADN'T A PARTICLE OF LOVE FOR HER
I HAVE BEEN MARRIED THREE YEARS AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED FIVE DOLLARS IN MONEY SINCE TOWARDS SUPPORTING MY FAMILY
GREEN ZEBULON 383
WHITE MILES 223
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT HE ATTEMPTS TO BOLSTER UP MEN WHO WHETHER RESPECTABLE OR OTHERWISE FROM THEIR INCONSISTENCY INVOLUTIONS AND TERGIVERSATIONS IN REGARD TO THIS CASE PRODUCE NO POSSIBLE EFFECT UPON THE JUDICIAL MIND BUT THAT WHICH IS UNFAVORABLE TO THEMSELVES
HE WAS A PERSON OF AGREEABLE MANNERS AND WITHAL PRETTY SMART
IT WOULD BE A GREAT RELIEF IF SOME MEASURES COULD BE RESORTED TO TO KEEP THEM UNDER LEGAL RESTRAINT
NEVER SAID ANYTHING OUT OF THE WAY Q
MY BROTHER WAS BORN IN THAT YEAR
MY MIND IS AS FIRM AS EVER
SAID PERSON ESCAPED TO MAKE OUT AND DELIVER TO SUCH CLAIMANT HIS OR HER AGENT OR ATTORNEY A CERTIFICATE SETTING FORTH THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTS AS TO THE SERVICE OR LABOR DUE FROM SUCH FUGITIVE TO THE CLAIMANT AND OF HIS OR HER ESCAPE FROM THE STATE OR TERRITORY IN WHICH SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR WAS DUE TO THE STATE OR TERRITORY IN WHICH HE OR SHE WAS ARRESTED WITH AUTHORITY TO SUCH CLAIMANT OR HIS OR HER AGENT OR ATTORNEY TO USE SUCH REASONABLE FORCE AND RESTRAINT AS MAY BE NECESSARY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE TO TAKE AND REMOVE SUCH FUGITIVE PERSON BACK TO THE STATE OR TERRITORY FROM WHENCE HE OR SHE MAY HAVE ESCAPED AS AFORESAID
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE VICTORY COMPLETE THE ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS DEEMED IT OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO HAVE JANE JOHNSON IN COURT TO FACE HER MASTER AND UNDER OATH TO SWEEP AWAY HIS REFUGE OF LIES WITH REGARD TO HER BEING ABDUCTED AND HER UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE HER MASTER ETC
HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS WIFE PHILLIS AND ONE CHILD
I NEVER SAW MORE INTERESTING YOUNG MEN
MONTGOMERY THE COMPANION OF OSCAR COULD SCARCELY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE WHITE FOLKS
I WISH I COULD PEEP INTO YOUR HOUSE TO-NIGHT AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PACKAGES ON HAND
THE SIMPLE ANNOUNCEMENT THEN THAT A PARTY OF THIS NUMBER HAD ARRIVED FROM NORFOLK OR RICHMOND OR PETERSBURG GAVE THE COMMITTEE UNUSUAL SATISFACTION
THE CLAIM OF THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE HIM BACK TO SAVANNAH WILL NOT BE LISTENED TO FOR A MOMENT BY ANY COURT
HE SAYS THEY OWE THE CAPTAIN ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS FOR BOARD AND I GAVE HIM THREE DOLLARS TO PAY THE CAPTAIN AND TAKE THEM TO YOUR OFFICE
DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER FATHER ON A LONG VOYAGE HER MOTHER WAS ENGAGED IN MERCANTILE BUSINESS PURCHASING GOODS IN BOSTON IN EXCHANGE FOR OIL AND CANDLES THE STAPLES OF THE ISLAND
MOREOVER IF IT IS FITTING THAT WOMAN SHOULD DRESS IN EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW WHY NOT MAN ALSO
IT WILL BE CALCULATED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE A JUST SENSE OF THE BENEFICENT RESULTS OF THE GREAT SOCIAL REVOLUTION WE HAVE ACHIEVED AND TO INSPIRE THE PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN RACE WITH A HIGH APPRECIATION OF THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY THEY NOW ENJOY
OR IT MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF MEETINGS IN WHICH HE TOOK PART OPENLY
WOULDN'T GIVE ENOUGH TO EAT OR WEAR THESE FACTS AND MANY MORE WERE ELICITED FROM ELIJAH WHEN IN A CALM STATE OF MIND AND WHEN FEELING MUCH ELATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HIS EFFORTS IN CASTING OFF THE YOKE WERE MET WITH FAVOR BY THE COMMITTEE AND THAT THE ACCOMMODATIONS AND PRIVILEGES ON THE ROAD WERE SO MUCH GREATER THAN HE HAD EVER DREAMED OF

ON BEING TAKEN TO STAFFORD COURT-HOUSE JAIL HOWEVER THE SHERIFF PERMITTED HIM TO WALK A LITTLE WAYS IT OCCURRED TO WILLIAM THAT THEN WAS HIS ONLY CHANCE TO STRIKE FOR FREEDOM AND CANADA AT ALL HAZARDS
INDEED SO BOUNTIFULLY WERE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN SUPPLIED THAT AS THEY WERE BEING CONVEYED TO THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY STATION THEY LOOKED MORE LIKE A PLEASURING PARTY THAN LIKE FUGITIVES
GRAIN OF BALTIMORE WHO HIRED HIM OUT TO A FARMER
REMEMBER IF YOU LOSE THIS CHANCE YOU MAY NEVER GET SUCH ANOTHER ETC
MR BRISTER FROM LOWELL ADDRESSED THE MEETING
WITH KIND REGARDS A
I HAVE RITTEN A LETTER TO MY FRIEND P
THEIR NAMES WERE EDWARD AND WILLIAM
HE DID NOT HIMSELF FLOG BUT THE OVERSEER WAS ALLOWED TO CONDUCT THIS BUSINESS WHEN IT WAS CONSIDERED NECESSARY
DANIEL AFTER BEING SOLD HAD BEEN ALLOWED WITHIN THE TWO YEARS ONLY ONE OPPORTUNITY OF VISITING HIS WIFE
AS THE PROFFERED AID WAS WHOLLY UNSOLICITED AND AS THE COMMITTEE HAD NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS MEMBERS AND WITHAL AS THE FAVORS CONFERRED CAME AT TIMES WHEN THE CAUSE WAS PECULIARLY IN NEED THE COMMITTEE OFT-TIMES BEING DESTITUTE OF CLOTHING OR MONEY THE IDEA THAT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS PROVIDENTIALLY FAVORED IN THIS RESPECT WAS IRRESISTIBLE
HE WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM HIS EARLY LIFE BY HIS DEVOTION TO THE RELIEF OF THE OPPRESSED COLORED RACE
MR LUDLOW'S AND DR COX'S CHURCH AND THE HOUSE OF THE LATTER
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE GATHERING MEANS
HE WAS A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE MULATTO ABOUT THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE COULD READ AND WRITE AND WAS NATURALLY SHARP-WITTED
THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME STIRRING LINES WHICH SHE WROTE UPON THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT
SAYS THAT HE FLED FROM ONE G.H
THE DAY THAT HE DODGED HE ALSO TOOK THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF LETTERS HE BATTLED HIS WAY OUT OF MARYLAND AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING PENNSYLVANIA AND THE COMMITTEE
LLOYD GARRISON
LLOYD GARRISON
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO TELL YOU OF HIS CASE BECAUSE MISS WEVER HAS RELATED THE MATTER FULLY TO YOU
FOR THEIR RECOVERY IF TAKEN IN A SLAVE STATE I WILL GIVE $200 EACH
IN REFERENCE TO TREATMENT AMARIAN SAID
WAS IT NOT RATHER STRANGE THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO RETURN TO HIS KIND-HEARTED OLD MISTRESS THOMAS HENRY NATHAN COLLINS AND HIS WIFE MARY ELLEN.--THOMAS IS ABOUT TWENTY-SIX QUITE DARK RATHER OF A RAW-BONED MAKE INDICATING THAT TIMES WITH HIM HAD BEEN OTHER THAN SMOOTH
BUT NOW HIS EMOTION WAS OVERPOWERING
ANTHONY LONEY ALIAS WILLIAM ARMSTEAD AND CORNELIUS SCOTT
MR STILL I HOLD IN MY HAND A LETTER FROM A FRIEND OF SOUTH WHO CALLS ME TO PROMISE THAT I MADE TO HIM BEFORE I LEFT
THE SKETCH AS TAKEN FOR THE RECORD BOOK IS HERE TRANSCRIBED AS FOLLOWS
HE WAS DESTITUTE OF COURSE JUST AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF ROBBERS HAD STRIPPED HIM OF EVERY DOLLAR OF HIS EARNINGS
SHE WAS A STRIP OF A GIRL
WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENTS WERE RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF ARRIVALS WHICH WAS ALWAYS THE CASE THE DESCRIPTIONS GENERALLY WERE FOUND SO LIFELIKE THAT THE COMMITTEE PREFERRED TO TAKE THEM IN PREFERENCE TO PUTTING THEMSELVES TO THE LABOR OF WRITING OUT NEW ONES FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
THESE FACTS KEPT MATILDA IN EXTREME ANXIETY
SUE HAVING SUFFERED SEVERELY FIRST FROM ONE AND THEN ANOTHER SOMETIMES FROM FLOGGINGS AND AT OTHER TIMES FROM HUNGER AND AGAIN FROM NOT BEING HALF CLOTHED IN COLD WEATHER WAS PREPARED TO CONSIDER ANY SCHEME THAT LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION OF SPEEDY DELIVERANCE
I ASKED HIM IF HE BELIEVED HARDCASTLE WOULD KEEP HIS PROMISE
A FRIEND OF MINE SAYS ANTHRACITE COAL WILL ALWAYS PAY HERE FROM PHILADELPHIA AND THINKS A SMALL VESSEL MIGHT RUN OFTEN--THAT SHE NEVER WOULD BE SEARCHED IN THE POTOMAC UNLESS SHE WENT OUTSIDE
THOUSANDS WERE SOON AROUSED TO SHOW SYMPATHY WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN DORMANT
HERE IN EASTERN SOUTH CAROLINA SHE WAS IN ONE OF THE WORST PARTS OF THE STATE IN THE DAYS OF SLAVERY
JAMES HENRY AN OLDER SON IS I THINK NOT FAR FROM ST CATHARINE BUT HAS NOT AS YET REUNITED WITH THE FAMILY
FERTILE IN INVENTION PREPARED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND BRINGING TO THE CONVERSION OF OTHERS AN EARNESTNESS OF PURPOSE AND A FORCE OF LANGUAGE THAT SELDOM FAILED OF SUCCESS
THE REASON THAT I CAN TELL WHEN MAHALA RAN AWAY IS BECAUSE SHE TOOK A HUSBAND AND RAN AWAY
BUT SUCH PORTIONS AS I HAVE HAD TIME TO READ CONVINCE ME THAT AS A STIMULUS TO NOBLE EFFORT IT HAS MUCH VALUE
HE WAS OF A DARK CHESTNUT COLOR WELL-MADE AND ACTIVE
HE PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF HER IN HER OLD AGE AND NOT COMPEL HER TO LABOR SO SHE IS ONLY REQUIRED TO COOK AND WASH FOR A DOZEN SLAVES
WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE I WISH YOU WOULD ADVISE ME TWO DAYS BEFORE A SHIPMENT OF YOUR INTENTION AS NAPOLEON IS NOT ALWAYS ON HAND TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM AT SHORT NOTICE
WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF DOING THINGS BY THE HALVES--THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF BRINGING NUMBSKULLS
CONCERNING HER THE FOLLOWING IS ONE OF WILLIAM'S STATEMENTS
BUT HIS ESCAPE TO FREEDOM GAVE THEM A SATISFACTION WHICH NO WORDS CAN WELL EXPRESS
ROBERT HAD CONSTANTLY BEEN IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE NEGRO-TRADER HALL FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS PREVIOUS TO HIS LEAVING BEING OWNED BY HIM
MANN ESQ AND HIS HONOR JUDGE KELLEY THE DEFENDANTS HAD NO CAUSE TO COMPLAIN
THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM A LEADING DEMOCRATIC ORGAN OF PHILADELPHIA
SHOULD THE BOAT LAY UP PLEASE LET ME KNOW
THE GOVERNOR SAID JENNY WAS A VERY FINE GENTLEMAN AS GOOD AS I COULD EXPECT OF VIRGINIA
WHAT IS THE NEWS IN THE CITY
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS PRACTICALLY IN FAVOR OF WRINGING EVERY DROP OF BLOOD FROM THEIR BODIES
I HAVE RECEIVED TWO OR THREE LETTERS FROM A LADY IN THAT PLACE AND THE LAST ONE SAYS THAT MY WIFE'S MISTRESS IS DEAD AND THAT SHE EXPECTS TO BE SOLD
SAY TO BROTHER SUEL THAT HE MUST NOT FORGET WHAT GOD HAS CONSIGHN TO HIS HAND TO DO THAT HE MUST PRAY IN HIS CLOSET THAT GOD MIGHT TEACH HIM
NO PRIVILEGES SCANTILY CLAD POOR FOOD AND A HEAVY YOKE WAS THE POLICY OF THIS SUPERIOR ROBERT TESTIFIED THAT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS MATTERS HAD BEEN GROWING WORSE AND WORSE
PASSENGERS TRAVELING WITH THEIR MASTERS HORSES AND CARRIAGES--"BREAK DOWN"--CONFLICT WITH WHITE MEN--SIX PASSENGERS RIDING TWO HORSES C
MAY THE LORD BE WITH YOU AND ALL YOU AND ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD
CANADA YET CRIES FREEDOM
THE CONSEQUENCE IS I PREACH MUCH ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
ALSO A LETTER FOR THEE
IN THUS BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS HIRE HE CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO STAY IF HE COULD GET AWAY
SHE LEFT HER MOTHER
SAID ABRAM THERE WAS AN OLD MAN NAMED IKE WHO BELONGED TO THE SAME ESTATE THAT I DID HE WAS TREATED LIKE A DOG
COLE WM 418
HE WAS THE SAME STRONG RESOLUTE MAN IN SPIRIT TO THE LAST
OF DARK COPPER COLOR
PASSING UNNOTICED OTHER INTERESTING CONFLICTS IN HIS HARD LIFE SUFFICE IT TO SAY HE LEFT HIS WIFE ANN AND THREE CHILDREN BENJAMIN JOHN AND ALFRED ALL OWNED BY COL
WHAT IS THE USE OF HARPING UPON THIS SUBJECT SUNDAY AFTER SUNDAY
THE CONDITION OF THIS CLASS SHE FEELS APPEALS LOUDLY FOR A REMEDY TO RESPECTABLE AND INTELLIGENT COLORED CITIZENS
I MYSELF THINK THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER TO TAKE HER PLACE
I WRITE IN MUCH HASTE
JOHN HENRY PETTIFOOT
TELLING THEM THAT THE PEOPLE ARE WORSE OFF THAN THEY ARE THERE
A SLAVE MAN OR WOMAN RUNNING FOR LIFE HE WITH A BUNDLE ON HIS BACK OR SHE WITH A BABE IN HER ARMS WAS ALWAYS A VERY INTERESTING SIGHT AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE HELD IN REMEMBRANCE
WILL SELL A SLAVE AS QUICK AS ANY OTHER SLAVE-HOLDER
WHITNEY ISRAEL 105
I WILL FORWARD THE MONEY AND A LETTER
PETER JACKSON ALIAS STAUNCH TILGHMAN
JOHN IS A LIKELY YOUNG MAN QUITE BRIGHT IN COLOR AND IN INTELLECT ALSO
HE HAS THE ASSURANCE OF THE JUDGE THERE THAT THEY WILL BE TRIED AND THEIR CASE DECIDED BY DELAWARE LAWS BY WHICH THEY MUST BE DECLARED FREE AND RETURNED HERE
HILL JOS
WITH ONLY A MODERATE EDUCATION HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF TO THE TOP ROUND OF THE LADDER AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DOWN-TRODDEN SLAVE
HAVING PRACTICED THIS TILL HE COULD MAKE IT HE EVER AFTER USED IT IN HIS ACCOUNTS
IF THE RECORD OF HIS LONG LIFE COULD BE FULLY WRITTEN WHICH IT CAN NEVER BE SINCE EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY IN COMPANY IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE WITH CHILDREN WITH PRISONERS WITH THE INSANE VIRTUE WENT OUT OF HIM THAT NO HUMAN OBSERVATION COULD MEASURE OR DESCRIBE WHAT TOUCHING INTEREST WOULD BE ADDED TO THE HISTORY OF OUR POOR AND VICIOUS POPULATION FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY PAST
HE WILL BE BURIED IN THE FRIENDS GRAVE-YARD CORNER OF FOURTH AND WEST STREETS ON SATURDAY NEXT AT THREE O'CLOCK P.M AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN MEMORANDUM OF AN AGREEMENT MADE BY HIM A YEAR AGO WITH THEM THE COLORED PEOPLE WILL BEAR HIM TO HIS GRAVE THEY HAVING SOLICITED OF HIM THAT HONOR
SEND ME ONE OF THE VIRGINIA PAPERS
OF ALL THE HEROES IN CANADA OR OUT OF IT WHO HAVE PURCHASED THEIR LIBERTY BY DOWNRIGHT BRAVERY THROUGH PERILS THE MOST HAZARDOUS NONE DESERVE MORE PRAISE THAN LEAR GREEN
HENRY HEART RESIDING AT SAM'S CREEK EXERCISED AUTHORITY OVER EVAN
AND CERTAINLY IT DID CONSERVE THE DEVIL ADMIRABLY
SHE HAS CONTRIVED TO GET SOME EDUCATION AND HAS SINCE BEEN TEACHING SCHOOL
AS THERE WAS NO OTHER COURSE TO PURSUE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD MY SLEIGH BROUGHT OUT AND WE ALL WENT TO MIDDLETOWN BEFORE MY FRIEND WILLIAM STREETS WHO WAS THEN IN COMMISSION AS A MAGISTRATE
AND SO IT WAS ALL VERY EASILY SETTLED HERE POINTING TO HIS BREAST GREAT CHEERING I COULD NOT HELP BEING AN UNCOMPROMISING ABOLITIONIST
IT CONTINUED TO POUR UPON THEM FOR NEARLY THREE DAYS
HE OWNED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SLAVES
FROM LONDON TOO THERE ARE VERY EARNEST APPEALS TO ASSIST THE AFRICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY THANK THEE FOR THE NEWSPAPERS AND THY LAST KIND NOTE
OUTSTRIP THE WINDS AND LEAVE BEHIND THE MURMUR OF THE RESTLESS WAVES
THE ONLY WORDS THAT I HEARD FROM ANY ONE OF AN OBJECTIONABLE CHARACTER WERE
NOR HAD THEY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE FROM WHENCE THEY SUPPOSED THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN THE LAST NAMES OF THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER OR WHERE THEY WERE BORN
STILL SIR:--I AR RIVD ON FRIDAY EVENEN BOT I HAD RITE SMART TROBLE FOR MY MONY GAVE OUT AT THE BRIDGE AND I HAD TO FOT ET TO ST CATHERIN THO I WENT RITE TO WORKE AT THE WILLARD HOUSE FOR 8 DOLOR MONTH BARGEND FOR TO STAE ALL THE WENTOR BOT I HAVENT ENY CLOUSE NOR MONEY PLEASE SEND MY TRONKE IF ET HAS COME
KIT IS ABOUT 35 YEARS OF AGE FIVE FEET SIX OR SEVEN INCHES HIGH DARK CHESTNUT COLOR AND HAS A SCAR ON ONE OF HIS THUMBS
ALTHOUGH HE AT LAST SUCCEEDED THE SEVERE TRIALS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD TO PASS IN ESCAPING CAME VERY NEAR COSTING HIM HIS LIFE
BESIDES HE HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF AN EDUCATION ETC WHICH LOOKED BADLY ENOUGH BEFORE HE LEFT MARYLAND BUT IN THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM AND FROM A FREE STATE STAND-POINT THE IDEA THAT MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN SHOULD ASSUME SUCH GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS AS TO CAUSE HIM TO SEIZE HIS FELLOW-MAN AND HOLD HIM IN PERPETUAL BONDAGE WAS MARVELLOUS IN THE EXTREME
ENNETS STEPHEN AND WIFE MARIA WITH THREE CHILDREN HARRIET AMANDA AND BABE 530
IN THE MEANWHILE HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM ELEVEN CHILDREN THE GREATER PART OF WHOM WERE EMANCIPATED FROM THE TROUBLES OF LIFE BY DEATH AND THREE ONLY SURVIVED
ONE NIGHT I STAYED AT A MEDICAL GENTLEMAN'S WHO IS NOT A LARGE PLANTER
AM I NAUGHTY BEING A PROFESSED NON-RESISTANT TO ADVISE THIS POOR FELLOW TO SERVE FATHER ABRAHAM
DURING THE INTERVIEW A FULL INTERCHANGE OF THOUGHT RESULTED THE FUGITIVES WERE WELL CARED FOR AND IN DUE TIME BOTH WERE FORWARDED ON FREE OF COST
AND SIDE BY SIDE MAY THEY STAND IN ALL THAT IS JUST AND NOBLE AND GOOD LEADING THE WAY GLORIOUSLY IN THE WORLD'S REDEMPTION
BUT WILL KEEP JUST IN SIGHT OF HIM AND OBEY ANY SIGN HE MAY GIVE
SHE WAS FROM NORFOLK
HERE THEREFORE IN MY JUDGMENT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE REASON FOR VIGOROUSLY PUSHING THE CIRCULATION OF THIS HUMBLE VOLUME--THAT IT MAY TESTIFY FOR THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS AS NO OTHER WORK CAN DO
A YOUNG PHYSICIAN SON OF ONE OF HIS OLD FRIENDS AFTER ATTENDING HIS FUNERAL WROTE TO A FRIEND AS FOLLOWS
AT LEAST HE CLAIMED TWO-THIRDS ALLOWING FOR THE WIDOW ONE-THIRD
FORTUNATELY THE MOTHER HAD SECURELY PRESERVED THE PAPER GIVEN HER BY HER MASTER SO MANY YEARS BEFORE RELEASING HER
BUSTILL P
TAYLOR STEPHEN 139
STAYING TO WEAR THE YOKE HE FELT WOULD RATHER MAKE IT WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER FOR ALL CONCERNED
SOMETIMES MCVEE WOULD SELL SLAVES--LAST YEAR HE SOLD TWO
I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF THIS PROVINCE BUT I BELEAVES THAT THERE IS ROME ENOUGH FOR THE COLORED AND WHITES OF THE UNITED STATES
AND THE POOR SLAVES FOR WHOM HE PERILED SO MUCH INTO WHAT DEPTHS OF HOPELESSNESS AND WOE ARE THEY AGAIN PLUNGED
THE COMMITTEE STRONGLY PROTESTED AGAINST FUGITIVES WRITING BACK TO THE SOUTH THROUGH THE MAILS ON ACCOUNT OF THE LIABILITY OF GETTING PARTIES INTO DANGER AS ALL SUCH LETTERS WERE LIABLE TO BE INTERCEPTED IN ORDER TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE NAMES OF SUCH AS AIDED THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
JACK HAD A GOOD REASON FOR HIS COURSE NEVERTHELESS
9 ANY INSPECTOR OR OTHER PERSON APPREHENDING A SLAVE IN THE ACT OF ESCAPING FROM THE STATE ON BOARD A VESSEL TRADING TO OR BELONGING TO A NON-SLAVE-HOLDING STATE OR WHO SHALL GIVE INFORMATION THAT WILL LEAD TO THE RECOVERY OF ANY SLAVE AS AFORESAID SHALL BE ENTITLED TO A REWARD OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE PAID BY THE OWNER OF SUCH SLAVE OR BY THE FIDUCIARY HAVING CHARGE OF THE ESTATE TO WHICH SUCH SLAVE BELONGS
THE COMMITTEE ADVISED HIM TO SEARCH IN CANADA AND IN ORDER TO ENABLE HIM TO GET ON QUICKLY AND SAFELY THE COMMITTEE AIDED HIM WITH MONEY C IN 1853

SOME I SENT WEST BY BOATS TO PITTSBURGH AND OTHERS TO YOU IN OUR CARS TO PHILADELPHIA AND THE INCIDENTS OF THEIR TRIALS FORM A PORTION OF THE HISTORY YOU HAVE COMPILED
THEY WALKED THE ENTIRE DISTANCE FROM HEDGEVILLE VA TO GREENVILLE PA
FLED FROM NEAR FREDERICK MD FROM THE CLUTCHES OF A FARMER BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM DORSEY WHO WAS DESCRIBED AS A SEVERE MASTER AND HAD SOLD TWO OF JACOB'S SISTERS SOUTH ONLY THREE YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE
HE MADE KNOWN HIS PLANS TO A DEAR BROTHER WHO ENGAGED TO FURNISH HIM OCCASIONALLY WITH FOOD
MEANTIME A RADICAL CHANGE OF OPINION ON THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS LED MR MCKIM FORMALLY TO SEVER HIS CONNECTION WITH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND MINISTRY
AS SHE LIVED OUT HER WHOLE LIFE OF SEVENTY-THREE YEARS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HER BIRTH-PLACE WITH REGARD TO HER PORTRAIT WHICH WAS SOLICITED FOR THIS VOLUME THE SAME LADY THUS WRITES
IT IS A WORK WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO REFLECT AN UNUSUAL CREDIT UPON THE CARE INDUSTRY AND STERLING ABILITY OF ITS AUTHOR
CLOSE ON HER RIGHT SAT AN ILL-FAVORED WHITE MAN HAVING A CANE IN HIS HAND WHICH I TOOK TO BE A SWORD-CANE
FOR AFTER SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF TESTIMONY UNBROKEN AND INCONTESTABLE AS THAT WE HAVE EXHIBITED HERE IT WOULD BE A MONSTROUS PERVERSION OF REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT ANYTHING MORE COULD BE REQUIRED
IN THE MEAN TIME THROUGH THE WAR AND THE PROCLAMATION OF FATHER ABRAHAM THE FETTERS HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE LIMBS OF THE SLAVE AND THE WAY TO RICHMOND WAS OPEN TO ALL
NO WONDER HE WAS FEARED BY THE SLAVE-HOLDERS NOT ALONE OF HIS OWN STATE BUT OF THE WHOLE SOUTH
PLEASE GIVE MY LOVE AND CHARLOTTE'S TO MRS STILL AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS TO US WHILE AT YOUR HOUSE
ANNA PERRY WAS THE INTENDED OF GENERAL
AND TO HER ASTONISHMENT HE WAS SOON AMONG THE MISSING
BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT REMAIN A SLAVE ON THEIR ACCOUNT
FREDERICK NIXON WAS ABOUT THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE AND BELONGED TRULY TO THE WIDE-AWAKE CLASS OF SLAVES AS HIS MARKED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL APPEARANCE INDICATED
HE HAD NO IDEA OF WORKING IN THE CONDITION OF A SLAVE BUT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK HE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED MUCH LONGER THAN HE DID
IN ENTERING THIS STORY ON THE BOOK AT THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL THE CONCLUDING WORDS WERE WRITTEN THUS
THE FIRST ARRIVAL TO BE HERE NOTICED CONSISTED OF DAVID BENNETT AND HIS WIFE MARTHA WITH THEIR TWO CHILDREN A LITTLE BOY NAMED GEORGE AND A NAMELESS BABE ONE MONTH OLD
I WAS TRULY SORRY TO HEAR OF THE FATE OF THAT POOR FELLOW WHO HAD PERILED SO MUCH FOR LIBERTY
THIS ARRIVAL CAME BY STEAMER
MYERS JOHN 434
THE SPIRIT OF SLAVERY MORE INTOLERANT
PLEASE WRITE LETTING ME KNOW WHAT MOST IS NEEDED TO AID YOU IN YOUR GLORIOUS WORK A WORK WHICH WILL SURELY MEET ITS REWARD
THE DR WAS SOON IN BED SLEEPING SOUNDLY AND JOE IN HIS NEW COAT AND PANTS WRAPPED UP IN THE BED QUILT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM QUITE COMFORTABLY
HE WAS AT FIRST AS DR BOWDITCH TOLD US BARRICADED IN HIS SHOP ON CAMBRIDGE STREET I SAW HIM THERE AND HE SAID ELLEN MUST NOT BE LEFT AT YOUR HOUSE WHY

HE WANTED TO SECURE THE FREEDOM OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AS EARNESTLY AS HE HAD EVER DESIRED TO SEE HIS MOTHER YET HE COULD NOT AT FIRST HEARKEN TO THE IDEA OF HAVING THEM RESCUED IN THE WAY SUGGESTED BY CONCKLIN FEARING A FAILURE

SHE WAS A CATHOLIC AND WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF MARY ELIZA SMITH THIS WAS PHILIP'S TESTIMONY AGAINST HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HANSON IF OUT OF THE STATE AND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF IN THE STATE
UNDER THESE CONSIDERATIONS HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO LET THE CASHIER LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF AND HE WOULD DO THE SAME
MY MIND DONT DECEIVE AND IT APPEARS TO ME AS IF I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN AT MY TIME OF WRITING THIS LETTER I AM DESITUTE OF MONEY I HAVE NOT GOT IN NO BUSINESS YET BUT WHEN I DO GET INTO BUSINESS I SHALL WRITE YOU AND ALSO REMEMBER YOU
ONE WOMAN HERE HAS BEEN EXPRESSING HER MIND VERY FREELY TO ME ABOUT SOME OF OUR NORTHERNERS AND WE ARE NOT ALL CONSIDERED HERE AS SAINTS AND ANGELS AND OF COURSE IN THEIR MINDS I GET ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OR ALL THE HUMBUGS THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE ME

I CAME AFTER TWENTY-TWO YEARS ABSENCE TO SEEK MY OWN RIGHTS AND AS AN EVIDENCE FOR MY FRIEND
EIGHTH LETTER
THEY MET AT THE STATION IN PHILADELPHIA
WELL AROUND HERE THERE ARE SO MANY--TOM DICK AND HARRY--THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHO YOUR FRIEND IS
FREEDOM HE FELT WAS EVEN WORTH THE GIVING UP OF PARENTS
MRS
MRS
I CARRIED PAPERS HAD YOU A WIFE I DID BUT HER MASTER WAS A VERY BAD MAN AND WAS OPPOSED TO ME AND WAS AGAINST MY COMING TO HIS PLACE TO SEE MY WIFE AND HE PERSUADED HER TO TAKE ANOTHER HUSBAND IN PREFERENCE TO ME
EVERY FEW MOMENTS CLOUDS FLOATED ACROSS THE MOON ALTERNATELY LIGHTING UP AND SHADING THE RIVER WHICH SWELLED BY AUTUMN RAINS RAN A FLOOD
THE MAN THAT BROUGHT ME AWAY KNOWS THE COLORED AGENT AT PETERSBURG AND KNOWS HE WILL DO ALL HE CAN TO FORWARD MY WIFE
BUT THE HOPE OF FINAL VICTORY AND HIS DAILY SUFFERINGS BEFORE HE STARTED KEPT HIM FROM FALTERING EVEN WHEN STARVATION AND DEATH SEEMED TO BE STARING HIM IN THE FACE
HE HOWEVER MADE NO MENTION OF THIS CONTEMPLATED MOVEMENT TO HIS WIFE LOUISA
SLAVE CAPTURES AND SLAVE HUNTS MORE APPALLING
I EXPECT YOU KNOW WHO I ALLUDE TO IT IS THE GIRL THAT SENT ME AWAY
THIS PROPOSITION WAS MADE NOT AS ADMITTING ANY RIGHT OF THE MASTERS TO COMPENSATION
I THINK YOU COULD NOT FAIL TO BE INTERESTED IN HEARING HOW WE BECAME KNOWN TO EACH OTHER AND THE PROOF OF OUR BEING BROTHERS ETC ALL OF WHICH I SHOULD BE MOST GLAD TO RELATE BUT TIME WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO DO SO
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE FROM THE ADVICE OF FORCIBLE RESISTANCE SO FAMILIARLY GIVEN BY THE ABOLITIONISTS THAT THEY ARE QUITE UNAWARE THAT THERE IS ANY SUCH CRIME AS TREASON RECOGNIZED BY THE CONSTITUTION OR PUNISHED WITH DEATH BY THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES
I COULD GO NOW
OWING TO HARD TREATMENT CHARLES WAS INDUCED TO FLY TO CANADA FOR REFUGE
JOHN WAS A MAN SMALL OF STATURE DARK WITH HOMELY FEATURES BUT HE WAS VERY DETERMINED TO GET AWAY FROM OPPRESSION
A WOMAN WAS CRUELLY TREATED ONCE OR MORE THAN ONCE
HE GRADUATED AT DICKINSON COLLEGE IN 1828
I CAN ALSO GET THE WHOLE HISTORY ESCAPE CAPTURE TRIAL CONVICTION AND REDEMPTION OF JAMES AND JOHN LEWIS AND ONE OTHER
JAMES CRUMMILL SAMUAL AND TOLBERT JONES AND HENRY HOWARD
THE EXTRAORDINARY SMARTNESS OF THE LITTLE FELLOW ONLY TEN YEARS OLD ASTONISHED ALL WHO SAW HIM
NOR WAS HE ALL MUSCLE BY A GREAT DEAL
HE WAS WELL-KNOWN TO THE COLORED PEOPLE FAR AND NEAR AND WAS ESPECIALLY SOUGHT WITH REGARD TO BUSINESS PERTAINING TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AS A FRIEND WHO WOULD NEVER FAIL TO ASSIST AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN EVERY TIME OF NEED
SUCH SIMPLE FACTS AS WERE THEN WRITTEN ARE SUBSTANTIALLY AS FOLLOWS
NEVERTHELESS HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED PRETTY WELL COMPARED WITH OTHERS
IN THIS SITUATION DAILY WEARING THE YOKE OF UNREQUITED LABOR THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF HARRIET TUBMAN SOMETIMES CALLED MOSES THE LIGHT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND CANADA SUDDENLY ILLUMINATED HIS MIND
HERE AT LEAST IS ONE INSTANCE WHERE A MARYLAND SLAVE-HOLDER LENDS HIS INFLUENCE TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAUSE
10 1855 ARRIVED TWO MEN FROM NEAR CHESTERTOWN MD
MR TAPPAN WAS THEREFORE REQUESTED TO FURNISH A FEW REMINISCENCES FROM HIS OWN STORE-HOUSE WHICH HE KINDLY DID AS FOLLOWS
I WILL DO SO WHEN I SEE HIM HE ARE ON THE LAKE SO IS STEWART
BUT AS SOON AS THE WAY OPENED FOR HIS RETURN TO HIS OLD HOME NEW BEDFORD NO LONGER HAD SUFFICIENT ATTRACTIONS TO RETAIN HIM
TWO OTHERS WHO STARTED WITH THEM WERE CAPTURED ALL THESE PERSONS JOURNEYED TOGETHER FROM LOUDON CO VA
GIBBONS WIFE OF DANIEL GIBBONS A NOTICE OF WHOM APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN THIS WORK
HE WAS USED VERY HARD WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS ESCAPE THOUGH THE IDEA THAT HE WAS ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED FOR THE PREVIOUS TWELVE YEARS
PERRY REPORTED THAT HE LEFT A MAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN M
BUT TO LOOK AT HIM AND TO HEAR HIM TEACH YOU WOULD PERHAPS THINK HIM NOT VERY LATELY FROM THE NORTH
WITH A WIFE AND ONE CHILD THIS MIGHT SEEM A SMALL SUM BUT IN REALITY IT WAS A LIBERAL OUTLAY COMPARED WITH WHAT MANY SLAVES WERE ALLOWED
JACOB FLED FROM ANNAPOLIS
FOR SOME REASON NOT NOTICED IN THE BOOK JAMES BECAME DISSATISFIED CHANGED HIS NAME TO HENRY RIDER GOT AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASS AND LEFT THE DR AND HIS OTHER ASSOCIATIONS IN MARYLAND
SLAVERY HAD STAMPED HIM UNMISTAKABLY FOR LIFE
I SHALL PRESENT HIS LETTER TO THE CHURCHES OF THIS CITY
ONE WAS WOUNDED THE REST ESCAPED UNHURT
THEY HAD HAD TEN CHILDREN
JUDGING FROM THE APPEARANCE AND MANNERS OF THE CHILDREN THEIR MOTHER HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN MOST FAITHFUL TO THEM FOR MORE HANDSOME WELL-BEHAVED INTELLIGENT AND PLEASING CHILDREN COULD NOT EASILY BE SELECTED FROM EITHER RACE OR ANY STATION OF LIFE
I PREACH LECTURE AND WRITE FOR THE SLAVE CONTINUALLY
ON BEING PUT UPON THE AUCTION-BLOCK THIS YOUNG MAN ADDRESSED THE BYSTANDERS AND TOLD THEM THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE
NO MATTER AT THE OUTSET HOW FEW MAY BE DISPOSED TO RALLY ROUND THE STANDARD YOU HAVE RAISED--IF YOU BATTLE UNFLINCHINGLY AND WITHOUT COMPROMISE--IF YOURS BE A FAITH THAT CANNOT BE SHAKEN BECAUSE IT IS LINKED TO THE ETERNAL THRONE--IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME WHEN VICTORY SHALL COME TO REWARD YOUR TOILS
YES BUT I NEVER HEARD HIM PREACH
MILES DID NOT YIELD HIS SEAT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
CLOTHING OF THE POOREST TEXTURE WAS ONLY SPARINGLY FURNISHED
HE WAS EVER READY TO SEND HIS HORSE AND CARRIAGE TO CONVEY THEM ON THE ROAD TO CANADA OR ELSEWHERE TOWARDS FREEDOM
IT IS ACTING IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH WE WISH TO SECURE THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT
HE WAS SOLD TO ABRAM WARRICK OF RICHMOND
THE GOVERNOR HAD NINE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
I SHOULD TAKE YOU TO BE COLORED SAID THE WITNESS TO MR BROWN I SUPPOSE HE LIVES SOMEWHERE UP THERE
THE COMMITTEE MADE NO OBJECTIONS GAVE HER A FREE TICKET ETC
HENRY WILSON LATE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES
MY HUSBAND WAS ALWAYS VERY KIND TO ME AND I HAD OFTEN WANTED HIM TO RUN AWAY WITH ME AND THE CHILDREN BUT I COULD NOT GET HIM IN THE NOTION
JAMES MAJOR LEWIS DENNIS BETTS PETER AND LAZARUS WITH THE WIFE AND CHILD OF THE FORMER NOT ONLY FOUND THEMSELVES STRIPPED FROM DAY TO DAY OF THEIR HARD EARNINGS BUT FEARFUL FOREBODINGS OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK WERE EVER UPPERMOST IN THEIR MINDS
THUS THESE PRELIMINARIES HAVING BEEN SATISFACTORILY ARRANGED IT ONLY REMAINED FOR MR DAVIS TO SEE DAN AND GIVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS ACCORDINGLY ETC
BEING FULLY SATISFIED OF THE TRUTH OF THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ESPOUSED HE RELIED WITH UNWAVERING CONFIDENCE UPON DIVINE POWER FOR THEIR ULTIMATE TRIUMPH AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO ADVOCATED THEM
BUT ANY BOOK OR BOOKS IN EITHER OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED CASES WILL BE OF USE TO ME
ESCAPE OF JOHN HENRY HILL FROM THE SLAVE AUCTION IN RICHMOND ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY 1853

WILSON A MERCHANT LIVING IN PORTSMOUTH VA
PETE MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MAN OF UNMIXED BLOOD WELL-MADE AND INTELLIGENT
THOUGH SHE CAME WITH THE CAMBRIDGE PARTY SHE DID NOT COME FROM CAMBRIDGE BUT FROM MARSHALL HOPE CAROLINE COUNTY WHERE SHE HAD BEEN OWNED BY CHARLES PETERS A MAN WHO HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY GETTING DRUNK SCRATCHING AND FIGHTING ETC NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN HIS OWN FAMILY EVEN
THAT THIS INSURRECTIONARY MOVEMENT IN ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS PARTS OF THE STATE HAS BEEN SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO OVERAWE THE LOCAL MINISTERS OF JUSTICE AND PARALYZE THE POWER OF THE LAW
HAS NO PERCEPTIBLE MARKS
HE WANTED THE NAMES TAKEN DOWN OF NINE MORE WHO EXPECTED TO GET OFF SOON AND MIGHT COME HERE
AS SOON AS THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED ITSELF THE ACTIVE COMMITTEE FEELING AN UNUSUAL DESIRE TO HEAR THEIR STORY BEGAN THE INVESTIGATION BY INQUIRING AS TO THE CAUSE OF THEIR ESCAPE ETC WHICH BROUGHT SIMPLE AND HOMELY BUT EARNEST ANSWERS FROM EACH
HENCE THIS PLAN WAS ABANDONED
STILL:--AS YOU PICK UP ALL THE NEWS THAT IS STIRRING I CONTRIBUTE A FEW SCRAPS TO YOUR STOCK GOING TO SHOW THAT THE POOR SLAVE-HOLDERS HAVE THEIR TROUBLES AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE
HIS MOTHER HARRIET AND SISTER FRANCES WERE NAMED AS NEAR KIN WHOM HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
STILL:--THE PLAN IS TO GO TO CANADA ON THE WABASH OPPOSITE DETROIT
SCOTT SAM 431
IT IS BUILT UPON THE GRAND RIVER WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED MILES LONG AND EMPTIES INTO LAKE ERIE
IF ON SUCH AN OCCASION IT WAS HARD TO FIND FITTING WORDS OF SYMPATHY OR ADEQUATE EXPRESSIONS OF INDIGNATION THE PLEASURE OF BEING PERMITTED TO GIVE AID AND COMFORT TO SUCH WAS IN PART A COMPENSATION AND A RELIEF
JOHN WAS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF AGE
BACON ABE 431
BUT WHERE TO FIND A MORE SECURE RETREAT HE COULD NOT,--DARED NOT VENTURE TO ASCERTAIN THAT DAY
DEAR SIR I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR OF THE ACCADENT THAT HAPPENED TO OUR FRIEND MR MEAKINS I HAVE READ THE LETTER TO ALL THAT LIVES IN ST CATHARINES THAT CAME FROM OLD VIRGINIA AND THEN I SENTED TO TORONTO TO MERCER CLAYTON TO SEE AND TO FARMAN TO READ FUR THEMSELVES
DEAR SIR:--I EMBRACE THIS OPERTUNITY TO INFORM YOU THAT I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER WITH PLEASURE I AM ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH AND HOPE THAT THESE FEW LINES WILL FIND YOU ENJOYING THE SAME BLESSING
TORONTO IS A VERY EXTENSIVE PLACE
12TH SHE UNFOLDED HER MIND IN THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE
TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT GIVING ME MY FREEDOM AS HAD BEEN PROMISED BEFORE STARTING ETC
YOU MAY POSSIBLY RECOLLECT HIM--HE WAS AT YOUR PLACE LAST AUGUST
CARR HIS OWNER A GROCER AND COMMISSION MERCHANT AFTER THIS WISE AND FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS
ALTHOUGH UTTERED IN A WHISPER THEY HAD A WONDROUS RING ABOUT THEM AND A WIDE-AWAKE BONDMAN INSTANTLY GRASPED THEIR MEANING
THEY WERE DIRECTED BY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF ONE OF THE PARTY TO FRANCIS S
OF A CHESTNUT COLOR TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE
MARSHAL A.E
SOON AFTER WE HAD SECRETED OURSELVES A MAN CAME NEAR BY AND COMMENCED SPLITTING WOOD OR RAILS WHICH ALARMED US
BUT NOT TILL AFTER THE NUMBER OF THE FUGITIVES HAD BEEN REDUCED TO TWO INSTEAD OF SIX
HAPPILY HE WAS ONLY ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT TOO OLD TO ACQUIRE SOME EDUCATION AND DO WELL BY HIMSELF
OFTEN CHASKEY WAS MADE TO FEEL THE LASH ON HIS BACK NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GOOD STANDING IN THE CHURCH
WHAT DOES THE GENTLEMAN SAY FURTHER
THIS PRODUCED NOT ONLY A SHOCK BUT A CRISIS IN THE AFFAIRS OF OUR LITTLE BOROUGH
LONG BEFORE THIS MOTHER ESCAPED THOUGHTS OF LIBERTY FILLED HER HEART
THE BONDAGE AND DELIVERANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SINK INTO OBLIVION WHILE THE WORLD STANDS
DAVID REASONED THAT AS JOSHUA HIS SO CALLED MASTER HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS JUST DUES FOR SO MANY YEARS HE HAD A RIGHT TO BORROW OR TAKE WITHOUT BORROWING ONE OF JOSHUA'S HORSES FOR THE EXPEDITION
I WOULD BE MUCH OBLIGE TO YOU IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME SOME ADVICE WHAT TO DO
NOT TO KNOW OF WHAT CHARACTERS THE RACE COULD PRODUCE WHEN STRAIGHTENED BY CIRCUMSTANCES NOR OF THOSE SMALL BEGINNINGS WHICH ENDED IN TRIUMPHANT EMANCIPATION WILL IN A SHORT TIME BE A REPROACH

81 SEC
THE NIGHT WAS VERY STORMY
AND IF THERE WERE DANGER THAT SUCH A STRAIN UPON THEIR SYMPATHIES AS THEY OFTEN UNDERWENT MIGHT PROVE UNHEALTHFUL IT WAS FULLY COUNTERACTED BY BALL-PLAYING AND ALL KINDS OF ACTIVE OUT-DOOR AMUSEMENTS OF CHILDHOOD SO THAT IT WAS NEVER KNOWN TO RESULT IN HARM
PERHAPS THE BEST WOULD BE TO SEND THEM TO SYRACUSE TO THE CARE OF MR LOGUEN AND HE WILL SEND THEM TO US
SAM HAD POSSESSED HIMSELF SOMEHOW OF A KNOWLEDGE OF READING AND WRITING A LITTLE AND FOR THE NEWS OF THE DAY HE HAD QUITE AN ITCHING EAR
THE OPPORTUNITY SEEMED FAVORABLE FOR TEACHING ABOLITIONISTS AND NEGROES THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH A CHIVALROUS SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN WHILE PASSING THROUGH PHILADELPHIA WITH HIS SLAVES
FATHER AND DAUGHTER HAD EACH DIFFERENT OWNERS ONE BELONGED TO JAMES SNYDER THE OTHER TO JOHN G

HIS EXPERIENCE UNDER THESE PROTECTORS HAD BEEN SIMILAR TO THAT OF EDWARD GIVEN ABOVE
THIS SYSTEM WAS ORGANIZED AND TIMES WERE SOMEWHAT BETTER
THEIR INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE CONTRADICTED THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN AN HOUR IN SLAVERY OR A MILE ON AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD

HE REMAINED THERE A FEW MONTHS BUT COULD CONTENT HIMSELF NO LONGER TO ENDURE THE ILLS OF HIS CONDITION
WHILE PROWLING AROUND IN THE DARKNESS HE APPEARED TO BE MAKING HIS WAY UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE CHARLES WAS REPOSING
THE COMMITTEE WERE A LITTLE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE GERMAN BRANCH OF CIVILIZATION CONDUCTED WHEN GIVEN UNLIMITED CONTROL OVER HUMAN BEINGS

WILLIAMS OF GEORGETOWN D.C WHO WAS IN THE WOOD BUSINESS AND KEPT A WHARF AS TO TREATMENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN USED VERY HARD BUT HAD BEEN WORKED HARD AND ALLOWED BUT FEW PRIVILEGES
BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A PECULIAR CASE CAN BE HAD SO CHEAP AND SO MANY YOUNG ONES THAT WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS
EVEN SCRAPS THROWN TO THE DOG SHE WAS HUNGER-BITTEN ENOUGH TO AIM FOR
IF I HAD NOT CONTINUED TO KNOW HER I WOULD NOT NOW KNOW HER
HE SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY WORSHIPPED A GOOD DEAL LIKE THE METHODISTS AND ALLOWED THEIR MEMBERS TO SWEAR HEARTILY FOR SLAVERY
THERE HIS FOOT PRONOUNCED INCURABLE WAS AMPUTATED AND THE ABOLITIONISTS SUPPLIED HIM WITH A WOODEN LIMB
NEED OF REDOUBLING HIS PACE WAS QUITE OBVIOUS
TWENTY-ONE PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A BOAT

ON BEING SENT FOR HE IMMEDIATELY ANSWERED THE SUMMONS AND MR MCKIM AT ONCE MADE KNOWN TO HIM HIS PLAN WHICH WAS TO SAVE A FELLOW-MAN FROM BEING DRAGGED BACK TO BONDAGE BY VISITING THE LADY AND ASCERTAINING FROM HER IN CONVERSATION THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE FUGITIVES THE NAMES OF THE WITNESSES AND ALL THE PARTICULARS
PROBABLY NO OUTRAGE WILL BE REMEMBERED WITH FEELINGS OF GREATER BITTERNESS THAN THIS PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF THE MASTER
BUT THEY WERE KINDLY CLOTHED FED DOCTORED AND SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING
FINALLY THE PRESSURE BECAME SO GREAT THAT HE FELT THAT HE MUST LEAVE AT ALL HAZARDS FORSAKING WIFE AND CHILD MASTER AND CHAINS
IN SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WHICH WERE MADE IN THIS CITY TO STIR UP THE PASSIONS OF THE IGNORANT AGAINST THE ADVOCATES OF HUMAN RIGHTS HIS PERSON AND PROPERTY WERE OPENLY THREATENED WITH ASSAULT

BY CHANCE ONE DAY HE CAME ACROSS A COPY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN CONTAINING THE STORY OF PETER STILL THE KIDNAPPED AND THE RANSOMED,"--HOW HE HAD BEEN TORN AWAY FROM HIS MOTHER WHEN A LITTLE BOY SIX YEARS OLD
IN FACT SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD AFFORD HER NO LITTLE RELIEF TO ALLOW HER PLACE TO BE OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER
MANY TIMES AT MIDNIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE AND GO TO HER MOTHER'S FOR SAFETY
WILLIAM MADE NO COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS MASTER OF A SERIOUS NATURE TOUCHING HIMSELF
IN THE NARRATIVE OF SAM TRUE IT APPEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN SOLD SEVERAL TIMES IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND HAD CONSEQUENTLY BEEN MADE TO FEEL KEENLY THE SMARTS OF SLAVERY BUT NOTHING OF THIS KIND WAS CHARGED AGAINST DR M SO THAT HE MAY BE SET DOWN AS A PRETTY FAIR MAN FOR AUGHT THAT IS KNOWN TO THE CONTRARY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEPRIVING SAM OF THE JUST REWARD OF HIS LABOR WHICH ACCORDING TO ST JAMES IS PRONOUNCED A FRAUD THE DOCTOR DID NOT KEEP SAM SO CLOSELY CONFINED TO DENTISTRY AND BOOK-KEEPING THAT HE HAD NO TIME TO ATTEND OCCASIONALLY TO OUTSIDE DUTIES

HE SPEAKS OF HIS OWN SERVICES WITH MODESTY AND IN FACT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT AT EXAGGERATION IN ANY ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL SERIES OF NARRATIVES WHICH HE RELATES
I SHALL ESTEEM THEM VERY HIGHLY FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THE WAY IN WHICH THEY COME THAT IS THROUGH AND BY YOUR VIGILANCE AS A COLORED MAN HELPING A COLORED MAN TO GET SUCH KNOWLEDGE AS WILL GIVE THE LIE TO OUR ENEMIES

ON FOUR OCCASIONS PREVIOUS TO THE FINAL ONE HE HAD MADE FRUITLESS EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM HIS TORMENTORS IN CONSEQUENCE OF BRUTAL TREATMENT
THE LESSONS HE HAD LEARNED GAVE HIM AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE AND FROM WHAT HE HAD OBSERVED IN THE DAILY PRACTICES OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU CAN DO LET US KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HEARS ANYTHING OF MY UNCLE LET ME KNOW
THIS PARTICULAR FRIEND WAS SCARCELY LESS OVERJOYED HOWEVER AND THEIR JOY DID NOT ABATE FOR SEVERAL HOURS
THEY HAD COUNTED WELL THE COST OF THIS STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY AND HAD FULLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT IF INTERFERED WITH BY SLAVE-CATCHERS SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO BITE THE DUST
HE BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHAT HE HAD ENDURED AS A SLAVE AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD HAD A RUGGED ROAD TO HOE ALL THE WAY ALONG AND THAT HE MIGHT HAVE IT MUCH WORSE IF HE WAITED TO BE SOLD

WILLIAM STILL:--_SIR_--I HAVE JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MY FRIEND WM
NOT TO REMEMBER THOSE THUS BRUISED AND MANGLED IT WOULD SEEM ALIKE UNNATURAL AND IMPOSSIBLE
MY CHILD IS IT YOU
HIS QUESTION THEREFORE IS SHE STILL RUNNING WITH BLEEDING FEET ETC WAS SIMPLY A PRECAUTIONARY STEP TO BLIND ANY WHO MIGHT PERCHANCE INVESTIGATE THE MATTER J.B
NEITHER OF THESE GIRLS HAD ANY GREAT COMPLAINT TO MAKE ON THE SCORE OF ILL-TREATMENT ENDURED
THANKFUL ARE WE ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO LIVE TO SEE THIS DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY'S SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF MANKIND
A NUMBER OF COLORED MEN WHO HAD BEEN DRIVEN TO DESPERATION BY THE ACTS OF THE MOB AND WHO HAD RELINQUISHED THE IDEA OF PROTECTION FROM THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES DETERMINED TO RESORT TO ARMS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES FROM THE FURTHER AGGRESSIONS OF THEIR PERSECUTORS
WITH SIMPLE FAITH THEY ENTERED THE SKIFF
IN RICHMOND HOWEVER IT SEEMED EXPEDIENT TO INVENT A NEW PLAN FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCIES HENCE THE BOX AND EXPRESS PLAN WAS DEVISED AT THE INSTANCE OF A FEW HEROIC SLAVES WHO HAD MANIFESTED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DIE IN A BOX ON THE ROAD TO LIBERTY RATHER THAN CONTINUE LONGER UNDER THE YOKE
I WISH TO KNOW IF ALL THINGS ARE WORKING RIGHT FOR THE REST OF MY BROTHERAN WHOM IN BONDAGE
WHEN YOU TELEGRAPH TO ME DIRECT TO THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL NIAGARA FALLS N.Y
ARRIVAL FROM TAPPS NECK MD 1859
MANY OF THOSE FROM THESE LOCALITIES WERE AMONGST THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND RESPECTABLE SLAVES IN THE SOUTH AND EXCEPT AT TIMES WHEN DISHEARTENED BY SOME GRAVE DISASTER WHICH HAD BEFALLEN THE ROAD AS FOR INSTANCE WHEN SOME FRIENDLY CAPTAIN OR CONDUCTOR WAS DISCOVERED IN AIDING FUGITIVES MANY OF THE THINKING BONDMEN WERE DAILY MANOEUVERING AND WATCHING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO ESCAPE OR AID THEIR FRIENDS SO TO DO
THESE PASSENGERS CAME FROM THE FIELD WHERE AS SLAVES VERY FEW PRIVILEGES HAD BEEN AFFORDED THEM
WITH THIS BEATING I WAS LAID UP SEVERAL WEEKS
ON FURTHER CONSULTATION ABOUT THE MATTER A SUITABLE HOUR WAS NAMED FOR THE MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE SLAVE AT THE ABOVE NAMED BOARDING-HOUSE
FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN OF THE EVENTFUL YEARS REFERRED TO IT WAS THE WRITER'S PRIVILEGE TO OCCUPY A POSITION IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE WITH MR MCKIM AND THE BEST OPPORTUNITY WAS THUS AFFORDED TO OBSERVE HIM UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHILE BATTLING FOR FREEDOM
MY BURDEN HAS BEEN GREAT ABOUT THESE BRETHREN
HER SUCCESS WAS WONDERFUL
HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT IN 1857 PROBABLY TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
I MAY WRITE AGAIN WHEN I GET TO CINCINNATI IF I SHOULD HAVE TIME
THE ALMOST CONSTANT RINGING IN HER EARS OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK MADE HER MOST MISERABLE ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD ONCE SUFFERED TERRIBLY BY BEING SOLD AND HAD LIKEWISE SEEN HER MOTHER AND FIVE SISTERS PLACED IN THE SAME UNHAPPY SITUATION THE THOUGHT OF WHICH NEVER CEASED TO BE MOST PAINFUL
SIMMONS OF PLYMOUTH NORTH CAROLINA AND WAS A FELLOW-SERVANT WITH ISAIAH
INDEED THE ONLY WONDER WAS THAT SO MANY APPEARED TO AS GOOD ADVANTAGE AS THEY DID AFTER HAVING BEEN CRUSHED DOWN SO LONG
DANIEL WAS YOUNG ONLY TWENTY-THREE GOOD LOOKING AND HALF WHITE WITH A FAIR SHARE OF INTELLIGENCE
LEVIN AND PETER EIGHT AND SIX YEARS OF AGE RESPECTIVELY WERE NOW LEFT AT THE MERCY OF THE ENRAGED OWNER AND WERE SOON HURRIED OFF TO A SOUTHERN MARKET AND SOLD WHILE THEIR MOTHER FOR WHOM THEY WERE DAILY WEEPING WAS THEY KNEW NOT WHERE

WHAT KIND OF PROCESS WAS HAD IF ANY I KNOW NOT
AT THIS HIS WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE
SOMETHING TOLD GEORGE THAT HE HAD WORKED LONG ENOUGH AS A SLAVE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE MAN ENOUGH TO TAKE THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND GO OFF TO A FREE COUNTRY
LOATHING THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY WITH HIS WHOLE HEART HE DETERMINED TO PERIL HIS ALL IN ESCAPING THEREFROM

YOUR FRIEND THOS
IN THIS WAY DOUBTLESS A GOOD BUSINESS MIGHT BE CARRIED ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR COMPETITION AND PROVIDED THE PLAN WAS CONDUCTED WITHOUT AFFECTING THE INHABITANTS ALONG THAT SHORE NO SUSPICION WOULD ARISE AS TO THE MANNER OR MAGNITUDE OF HIS BUSINESS OPERATIONS
BY THE AID OF PRAYER HE ENDURED THE SUFFERING THAT NIGHT
FOR THIS KINDNESS WE PAID HIM ONE DOLLAR
BY SIMILAR MEANS MANY SLAVES WERE SEEN IN SOUTHERN CITIES ELEGANTLY DRESSED AND STRANGERS AND TRAVELERS FROM THE NORTH GAVE ALL THE CREDIT TO INDULGENT MASTERS NOT KNOWING THE FACTS IN THE CASE
HE WAS NOW TWELVE MILES FROM HOME ON A GOOD ROAD HIS HORSE WAS GENTLE AND HE HIMSELF IN A GENIAL MOOD AT THE RECOVERY OF HIS BOND-WOMAN
ONE OF THE TRIED AGENTS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS ALONE COGNIZANT OF HIS DWELLING IN THE CAVE AND REGARDING HIM AS A TOLERABLY SAFE PASSENGER HAVING BEEN SO LONG SECRETED SECURED HIM A PASSAGE ON THE SCHOONER AND THUS HE WAS FORTUNATELY RELIEVED FROM HIS ELEVEN MONTHS RESIDENCE IN HIS DEN

THE PART WHICH THOMAS SHIPLEY ACTED IN THE TRYING SCENES SO OFTEN PRESENTED IN OUR COURTS DURING THIS UNHAPPY PERIOD HAS INVESTED HIS CHARACTER WITH A REMARKABLE DEGREE OF INTEREST
AN OLD CHEST OF SUBSTANTIAL MAKE SUCH AS SAILORS COMMONLY USE WAS PROCURED
THAT LUSTFUL TRADERS AND SENSUALISTS HAD ALREADY GLOATED OVER THE THOUGHT OF BUYING THEM IN A FEW SHORT YEARS
ALTHOUGH THEY HAD STRANGE ROADS WOODS AND NIGHT SCENES TO PASS THROUGH YET THEY FALTERED NOT

SLADE OF HARFORD CO AND HOW IN SOME WAY OR OTHER HE BECAME ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM AND JUST AS THE TIME ARRIVED FOR THE CONSUMMATION OF HIS LONG PRAYED-FOR BOON SAID SLADE WAS ABOUT TO SELL HIM,--AFTER THIS PROVOCATION IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE HOW JOHN CAME TO USE HIS KNIFE
THE PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO THE LADY AND WAS APPROVED AND A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING HERE ENTERED INTO THAT SHE SHOULD HIRE A CARRIAGE AND TAKE ALSO HER LITTLE GIRL WITH THEM
NO COMPLAINT AS TO ILL TREATMENT WAS MADE BY MOSES AGAINST MISS ABIGAIL THE TRUTH WAS HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN USED IN A MILD WAY WITH SOME DEGREE OF PRIDE HE STATED THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN FLOGGED BUT FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN FAVORED WITH THE EXALTED PRIVILEGE OF HIRING HIS TIME AT THE REASONABLE SUM OF $12 PER MONTH AS HE STOOD PLEDGED TO HAVE THIS AMOUNT ALWAYS READY WHETHER SICK OR WELL AT THE END OF THE MONTH HIS MISTRESS NEVER NEGLECTED TO BE IN READINESS TO RECEIVE IT TO THE LAST CENT

BUT HAVING BEEN LONG IDENTIFIED WITH THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE AS ONE OF ITS OLDEST AND ABLEST ADVOCATES IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF SLAVERY AND MOBS AND ALWAYS FOUND BY THE SIDE OF THE FUGITIVE TO COUNSEL AND SUCCOR HE WAS ON THIS OCCASION PERFECTLY COMPOSED
THUS WHILE MR W
SHADRACH WAS ARRESTED AND RESCUED IN BOSTON
AS ALL HOWEVER CANNOT BE MENTIONED AND AS THE GENERAL READER WILL LOOK FOR INCIDENTS AND FACTS WHICH WILL MOST FITTINGLY BRING OUT THE CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS IN THE CAREER AND ESCAPE OF BONDMEN THE REASONABLENESS OF THIS COURSE MUST BE OBVIOUS TO ALL
AT THE LOCK NOT UNEXPECTEDLY THREE OFFICERS CAME ON BOARD OF THE BOAT AND STOPPED HER

ON THE 3D OF THE PRECEDING MARCH HE WAS SOLD TO A NEGRO TRADER--THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO LIVE UNDER A TRADER WAS SO TERRIBLE HE WAS MOVED TO ESCAPE LEAVING HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE HAD ONLY BEEN MARRIED THREE MONTHS
THE FEAR OF THIS CHANGE BROUGHT HIM DIRECTLY TO MEDITATE UPON A TRIP TO CANADA
IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS ESCAPE HE REPLIED BAD USAGE HE WAS SMART AND QUITE DARK

THEY WERE STILL LEFT IN CHAINS
SEEING BUT ONE WAY OF ESCAPE AND THAT MORE PERILOUS THAN THE WAY WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT OR HENRY BOX BROWN TRAVELED HE RESOLVED TO TRY IT
THEY HAD CONSIDERED PRETTY THOROUGHLY HOW WRONGFULLY THEY WITH ALL OTHERS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HAD BEEN YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT SUBJECTED TO UNREQUITED TOIL SO RESOLVED TO LEAVE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES WHILE THEY WOULD TRY THEIR FORTUNES IN CANADA
BUT THE WOMAN AND CHILDREN HAD GIVEN OUT AND HE LEFT THEM WITH A COLORED FAMILY IN CECIL
STILL WE ARE LABORING ON THE SAME WALL THOUGH FAR APART
AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TIME OCCUPIED IN THE NECESSARY DUTIES OF HIS ORDINARY AVOCATIONS IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT HE POSSESSED NOT ONLY EXTRAORDINARY HUMANITY BUT UNCOMMON ACTIVITY AND ENERGY TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH
BUT THESE HEROES FELL INTO THE POWER OF THEIR ENEMIES
HOW DEPLORABLE THEIR SITUATION
AT SUCH A TIME THE VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE OR ENTREATY WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS AND HAD THE AVOWED FRIENDS OF THE COLORED MAN INTERFERED IN ANY PUBLIC MANNER THE EFFECT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN TO INCREASE THE FURY OF THE STORM AND TO HAVE DIRECTED THE VIOLENCE OF THE MOB UPON THEMSELVES
THE COLORED RACE MAY NOW READ OF ITS REAL HEROES ITS JOSHUAS SPARTACUSES TELLS AND GLENDOWERS AMONG THE LIST OF THOSE WHO SILENTLY BROKE THEIR CHAINS AND DARED EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO BREATHE THE SWEET AIR OF LIBERTY

THE SATISFACTION IT SEEMED ALWAYS TO AFFORD THESE GUARDIANS OF THE CITY TO FIND EITHER MALES OR FEMALES TRESPASSING IN THIS PARTICULAR WAS UNMISTAKABLE

WHOSE HOUSE WAS THE HOME OF THE ADVOCATE OF THE SLAVE FROM THE UNITED STATES ESPECIALLY IF HE WORE A COLORED SKIN OR HAD BEEN A SLAVE

HIS REMAINS WERE AGAIN INTERRED AND SUFFERED TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED
FROM THE THICK COATING OF COAL DUST AND THE EFFECT OF THE RAIN ADDED THERETO ALL TRACES OF NATURAL APPEARANCE WERE ENTIRELY OBLITERATED AND THEY LOOKED FRIGHTFUL IN THE EXTREME
HEAR HEAR THERE MAY BE PERHAPS THOSE WHO ASK WHAT IS THIS TRIUMPH OF WHICH I SPEAK
YES YES I AM CHOOSING THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE SOUTH FOR MY HOME
BY THIS DECISION ALEXANDER HELMSLEY WAS DECLARED TO BE A FREEMAN AND RETURNED WITH REJOICING INTO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY AND TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF A FREE CITIZEN
CHARLES HALL
ON THE SCORE OF TREATMENT HE SPAKE THUS
BRAVELY DEFIANTLY IN REGARD OF THE EVIL TO BE MET AND MASTERED BUT AS UNCONSCIOUSLY IN REGARD OF HIMSELF AS EVERY CONVICTION WORKS WHEN IT IS AS BROAD AS THE ENTIRE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF A MAN AND HAS HIS ENTIRE SPIRITUAL FORCE TO GIVE IT EXPRESSION
IN VARIOUS PLACES HE OPERATED WITH SUCCESS
MARY FRANCES HAILED FROM NORFOLK
CHASKEY WAS A MEMBER OF THE STILL POND CHURCH OF KENT COUNTY MD
YOU MUST HEAR THE JUDGE'S DECISION REMORSELESSLY GIVING UP THE WOMAN WITH HER CHILDREN BORN AND UNBORN INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR CLAIMANTS--BY THEM TO BE CARRIED TO THE SLAVE PRISON AND THENCE TO BE SOLD TO A RETURNLESS DISTANCE FROM THE REMAINING BUT SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF HER ONCE HAPPY FAMILY
WHEN EUPHEMIA CAME OUT THE HORSES WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND A LONG ROPE WAS ATTACHED WHICH WAS TAKEN BY AS MANY COLORED PEOPLE AS COULD GET HOLD OF IT AND THE WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN THUS CONVEYED TO HER HOME
FOR AS A SLAVE HE CONFESSED THAT HE HAD SEEN GOOD TIMES
I HAVE GIVEN ASSURANCES BOTH HERE AND IN NEW YORK FOUNDED ON YOUR ASSURANCES TO ME AND CAUSED MY FRIENDS IN THE LATTER PLACE GREAT ANXIETY SO MUCH THAT I HAVE HAD NO WAY TO EXPLAIN MY OWN LETTERS BUT BY SENDING YOUR LAST TWO TO MR TAPPAN

HIS WIFE BEING FAIR HE PUT HER ON THE CAR AT THE CORNER OF THIRD AND PINE STREETS AND WALKED TO THE CORNER OF FOURTH AND PINE STREETS WHERE HE STEPPED INTO THE CAR AND TOOK HIS SEAT
CHARLES HAD BEEN UNDER THE YOKE IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND HELD TO SERVICE BY DANIEL DELAPLAIN A FLOUR INSPECTOR
WHEN I STARTED I HADN'T A SHOE ON MY FOOT THESE WERE GIVEN TO ME
IN SPEAKING OF HER MISTRESS SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS ONLY TOLERABLE IT WOULD BE USELESS TO ATTEMPT A DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT SATISFACTION AND DELIGHT EVINCED BY ELIZA ON REACHING THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
THE COMMITTEE TOLD JIM THAT HE COULD GO FREE IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY AS THE SIMPLE FACT OF HIS MASTER'S BRINGING HIM INTO THE STATE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH HIS FREEDOM BEFORE THE COURTS
I WARE SORRY TO HEAR OF THE DEATH OF MRS FREAMAN
YOUR BOOK WILL TEACH US TO HONOR BOTH
A ROOM TO MYSELF IS A LUXURY THAT I DO NOT ALWAYS ENJOY
ANOTHER POOR FELLOW IS IN THIS TOWN RECENTLY FROM CHARLESTON WHENCE HE ESCAPED AMONG SOME COTTON BALES TO GREENOCK
THE FOLLOWING POINTED EPISTLE FROM JEREMIAH COLBURN ALIAS WILLIAM COOPER BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECTS OF FREEDOM ON MANY A PASSENGER WHO RECEIVED HOSPITALITIES AT THE PHILADELPHIA DEPOT SYRACUSE JUNE 9TH 1858

HE HAD ALSO BEEN ALLOWED BY HIS WIFE'S MISTRESS MISS JANE CARTER OF BALTIMORE TO HAVE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN HOME WITH HIM--THAT IS UNTIL HIS CHILDREN WOULD GROW TO THE AGE OF EIGHT AND TEN YEARS THEN THEY WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY AND HIRED OUT AT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS A YEAR AT FIRST
I HAVE NOT HEARD NO NEWS FROM VIRGINA
AT LEAST IT MADE AN INTERESTING ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE FIRST DAY'S EXAMINATION
THE TWO SUBJOINED MUST SUFFICE OTHERS MUCH LONGER CANNOT NOW BE PRODUCED THEY HAVE PROBABLY BEEN LOANED AND NOT RETURNED APRIL 15TH 1857
HE GRACIOUSLY CONDESCENDS TO LIBERATE THE OLDEST IN A YEAR AND THE REMAINDER IN PROPORTIONAL TIME IF THEY WILL COME BACK
HE WAS OWNED BY A MAIDEN LADY WHO LIVED AT WILLIAMSBURG BUT NOT REQUIRING HIS SERVICES IN HER OWN FAMILY SHE HIRED HIM OUT BY THE YEAR TO A MR JOHN WALKER A MANUFACTURER OF TOBACCO FOR WHICH SHE RECEIVED $120 ANNUALLY
SO PETER PROPOSED TO VINA THAT SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM CERTAIN SMALL ARTICLES CONSISTING OF A CAPE ETC WHICH HE WOULD CARRY WITH HIM AS MEMORIALS AND IN CASE CONCKLIN OR ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD EVER COME FOR HER FROM HIM AS AN UNMISTAKABLE SIGN THAT ALL WAS RIGHT HE WOULD SEND BACK BY WHOEVER WAS TO BEFRIEND THEM THE CAPE SO THAT SHE AND THE CHILDREN MIGHT NOT DOUBT BUT HAVE FAITH IN THE MAN WHEN HE GAVE HER THE SIGN CAPE AGAIN PETER RETURNED TO PHILADELPHIA AND WAS NOW WILLING TO ACCEPT THE OFFER OF CONCKLIN
IN PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION HENRY DECLARED THAT OUT OF HIS HIRE HE WAS ONLY ALLOWED $1.50 PER WEEK TO PAY HIS BOARD CLOTHE HIMSELF AND DEFRAY ALL OTHER EXPENSES
VERILY THE ROMANTIC AND TRAGIC PHASES OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD ARE WITHOUT NUMBER IF NOT PAST FINDING OUT
THE SPOKESMAN AMONGST THE FUGITIVES AFFECTING NO ORDINARY AMOUNT OF DIGNITY TOLD THEIR ASSAILANTS PLAINLY THAT NO GENTLEMAN WOULD INTERFERE WITH PERSONS RIDING ALONG CIVILLY"--NOT ALLOWING IT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THEY WERE SLAVES OF COURSE
BABY LITTLE GIRL AND HUSBAND LEFT BEHIND--THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD OFFERED
THE MAN FROM WHOM CHARLES FLED WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF JOHN CHIPMAN AND WAS DESCRIBED AS A FLESHY MAN WITH RANK BEARD AND QUICK TEMPER VERY HARD--COMMONLY KEPT FULL OF LIQUOR THOUGH HE WOULD NOT GET SO DRUNK THAT HE COULD NOT GO ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME CHARLES HAD BEEN THE MAIN DEPENDENCE ON HIS MASTER'S PLACE AS HE ONLY OWNED TWO OTHER SLAVES
HE LEFT HIS OLD MOTHER AND TWO BROTHERS WHOLLY IGNORANT OF HIS MOVEMENTS
IT WAS GRATIFYING TO KNOW THAT SUCH BOND-WOMEN SO EARLY GOT BEYOND THE CONTROL OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
THIS AFFAIR OCCURRED IN CHESTER COUNTY ONE OF THE MOST ORDERLY AND INTELLIGENT COUNTIES IN THE STATE A COUNTY SETTLED PRINCIPALLY BY QUAKERS
WILSON AS FOLLOWS ST
SUCH OUTRAGES ARE ALWAYS COMMON HERE AND NO KIND OF PROPERTY EXPOSED TO COLORED PROTECTION ONLY CAN BE CONSIDERED SAFE
YOURS FOR THE SLAVE N.R
SO OFF HE STARTED AT NO DOUBT A VERY DILIGENT PACE FOR AT THE END OF THE FIRST NIGHT'S JOURNEY HE HAD MADE MUCH HEADWAY BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS FEET
AND I WAS MUCH GRATIFIED TO FIND THEM CONTENTED PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY
IT FURNISHES THE WORLD PROOF THAT THOUGH SLAVES THEY WERE NEVERTHELESS MEN
HE HAS NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING WORK YET

AS THERE WERE PERSONS PRESENT WIFE HIRED GIRL AND A FUGITIVE WOMAN WHEN THE QUESTIONS WERE PUT TO HER SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF HER PLEDGE TO ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE

STILL:--YOUR KIND LETTER OF THE 22D INST HAS COME TO HAND AND I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFICES OF BENEVOLENCE TO MY BONE AND MY FLESH I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DOING A LITTLE FOR YOUR BROTHER PETER BUT I DO NOT THINK IT AN OFFSET

DEPOT SCHUYLKILL 11TH MO 7TH DAY 1857
IN LEAVING HOME HE HAD TO PART WITH HIS WIFE AND ONE CHILD SARAH AND LITTLE HENRY WHO WERE FORTUNATELY FREE
I TRIED YOUR PLAN OF NON-RESISTANCE WITH ALL MY POWER
ACCORDINGLY AN INTERVIEW WAS ARRANGED FOR A MEETING AND THE DUTY OF CONVEYING THIS PAINFUL INTELLIGENCE TO ONE OF THE SISTERS MRS SUPPLEE DEVOLVED UPON MR MCKIM
MCKIM AND WISE WHO DID NOT REST CONTENTED UNTIL AUNT HANNAH WAS SAFELY IN THEIR HANDS
AMONG THOSE THUS NOTIFIED WERE BRAVE HEARTS WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN RUNNING AWAY FROM SLAVE-CATCHERS
ALSO MR WM
AS HE HAD NO ONE TO DEPEND ON PARENTS AND RELATIVES BEING LEFT BEHIND IN NORFOLK HE FELT THAT HE MUST RELY UPON HIMSELF YOUNG AS HE WAS
I SEE BY THE CINCINNATI PAPERS THAT YOU HAVE HAD AN ATTEMPTED RESCUE AND A FAILURE
THAT IF THE NEGROES HEARD OF IT THEY COULD GET INFORMATION TO THE PARTIES BEFORE HE COULD GET HERE
IN TESTIFYING AGAINST HIS MASTER GEORGE USED VERY STRONG LANGUAGE
HUBBERT FINALLY SOLD EMANUEL TO A MR GRIGWAY OF NORFOLK
BUT FEW PASSENGERS EXPRESSED THEMSELVES IN STRONGER TERMS IN REGARD TO THEIR SO-CALLED MASTERS THAN WILLIAM PIERCE FROM LONG GREEN
THIS WAS THE ONLY REASON HE GAVE FOR FLEEING
PROBABLY THEY HAD SCARCELY REACHED PHILADELPHIA ERE THE FIERYS WERE IN HOT HASTE AFTER THEM AS FAR AS HARRISBURG IF NOT FARTHER
CHASE AT CINCINNATI AND FORTUNATELY FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF BOTH MEN IT WAS AT THE TIME OF THE TERRIBLE RIOTS THAT BROKE UP THE PRESS OF JOHN G
THE SCHEME BEING ALL READY FOR EXECUTION THE TIME FOR DEPARTURE WAS FIXED THE CARRIAGE HIRED DAVID HAVING SECURED HIS MASTER JOSHUA'S HORSE AND OFF THEY STARTED IN THE DIRECTION OF PENNSYLVANIA
CONSIDER THEIR POWER OF REVENGE
INDEED THE LITTLE AID ACTUALLY RENDERED BY THE COMMITTEE WAS COMPARATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED WITH THE AID RENDERED BY SOME WHO WERE NOT NOMINALLY MEMBERS
BY INQUIRY THEY GAINED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE DIRECTION THEY SHOULD STEER TO STRIKE FOR THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
ANN MARIA WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE GOOD-LOOKING PLEASANT COUNTENANCE AND OF A CHESTNUT COLOR HEIGHT MEDIUM AND INTELLECT ABOVE THE AVERAGE

ALL VERY MUCH FATIGUED FROM TRAVELING FELL ASLEEP EXCEPTING MYSELF
GREEN CHRISTOPHER AND WIFE ANN MARIA AND SON NATHAN 409
FORTY FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS IN SOME INSTANCES ELAPSED BUT THIS ARDENT SYMPATHY AND LOVE CONTINUED WARM AND UNWAVERING AS EVER
AND WELL ADAPTED AS THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY MIGHT BE TO RENDER HIM HAPPY IN THE SERVICE OF YOUNG AND OLD MASTERS IT WAS INSUFFICIENT FOR HIM
EDWARD HOWEVER REMEMBERED VERY SENSIBLY THAT HIS OWN BROTHER HAD BEEN SOLD SOUTH BY THESE LADIES
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WILL BE PAID FOR THE APPREHENSION AND DELIVERY OF BILL IF CAUGHT OUT OF THE STATE AND TWO HUNDRED IF IN THE STATE
IF THEE ANSWERS THIS THEE WILL PLEASE TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND WHAT IS THOUGHT OF IT BY THE WISE ONES

THE FIRST SETTLED PASTOR OF THIS LITTLE FLOCK WAS ONE SUFFICIENTLY WELL-KNOWN TO SUCH OF YOUR READERS AS WILL BE INTERESTED IN THIS TO MAKE MENTION OF HIS NAME UNNECESSARY
AND THAT ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION THEY WERE HONEST AND LOYAL TO THEIR BENEFACTORS AND ONLY TOO HAPPY TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES OF SHOWING THEIR GRATITUDE
ABUNDANT PROOF OF THIS MAY BE FOUND IN HIS PRINTED DISCOURSES
ALTHOUGH CAROLINE WAS NOT IN HER PERSON HALF SO STATELY NOR GAVE SUCH PROMISE OF HEROISM AS REBECCA--FOR CAROLINE WAS RATHER SMALL OF STATURE--YET SHE WAS MORE REFINED AND QUITE AS INTELLIGENT AS REBECCA AND REPRESENTED CONSIDERABLY MORE OF THE ANGLO-SAXON BLOOD
JAMES WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
NOW I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD PLEASE TO SEND ME SOME MONEY TO GO AFTER THOSE PEOPLE
BESIDES SEVERAL DAYS STILL REMAINED IN WHICH HE WAS PERMITTED TO LOOK FOR A NEW MASTER AND THESE HE DECIDED COULD BE PROFITABLY SPENT IN MAKING HIS WAY TOWARDS CANADA
HE WAS A PREPOSSESSING MAN OF TWENTY-SIX DARK COMPLEXION AND INTELLIGENT

CONWAY WITHOUT BIDDING HER GOOD-BYE OR ASKING FOR A PASS

TO CLEANSE THE CORRUPT FOUNTAINS OF OUR GOVERNMENT BY SENDING MEN TO CONGRESS WHO WILL PLEAD FOR OUR DOWN-TRODDEN AND OPPRESSED BRETHREN OUR CRUSHED AND HELPLESS SISTERS WHOSE TEARS AND BLOOD BEDEW OUR SOIL WHOSE CHAINS ARE CLANKING NEATH OUR PROUDEST BANNERS WHOSE CRIES AND GROANS AMID OUR LOUDEST PAEANS RISE EVERYWHERE IN THIS LATITUDE DOORS OPENED BEFORE HER AND HER GIFTS WERE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AS A VALUABLE ACQUISITION TO THE CAUSE
I WROTE HIM A LETTER YESTERDAY LETTING HIM KNOW JUST WHAT I THOUGHT OF HIM
HE TOLD THE LATTER WHICH RELATED TO HIS INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCES FOR ASSISTING FUGITIVES TO ESCAPE THE POLICE WITH MUCH PLEASURE IN HIS LATER YEARS
AFTER SOME MATURE REFLECTION THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS DIFFICULTY COULD BE VERY READILY OBVIATED BY HAVING THE FACE MUFFLED UP AS THOUGH THE YOUNG PLANTER WAS SUFFERING BADLY WITH THE FACE OR TOOTHACHE
THE LAST ENEMY HE SPIED WAS THE SHERIFF IN HIS STOCKINGS WITHOUT HIS SHOES
CHARLES H
I WAS IN THE HABIT OF TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF THIS PRECIOUS BOOK
GRACE ANNA ON HER FIRST VISIT TO PHILADELPHIA WHEN NINE YEARS OLD BOUGHT A COPY OF ONE OF THESE ENTITLED ZAMBO'S STORY PLEASED TO RECOGNIZE IN IT A FAVORITE OF HER STILL EARLIER CHILDHOOD
I SHALL BE VERY UNEASY ABOUT THEM TILL I HEAR THEY ARE SAFE
ARRIVED PER CITY OF RICHMOND--LETTER FROM CANADA CONTAINING EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE
SOON AFTER THEY ARRIVED IN BALTIMORE THEY WERE MET BY HAINES AND WILEY WHO HAD BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A PURSUING PARTY AND THEY GAVE THE INFORMATION THAT RACHEL WAS DEPOSITED IN CAMPBELL'S SLAVE-PEN
HE HAD OCCUPIED THE CONDITION OF A FARM LABORER
HE COOLLY REPLIED THAT HANDY HIS MASTER WAS NAMED GEORGE HANDY GOT HOLD OF ME TWICE AND I PROMISED MY LORD THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GET HOLD OF ME ANOTHER TIME OF COURSE IT WAS THE SEVERITY OF THESE TWO VISITATIONS THAT MADE JOHN A THINKER AND AN ACTOR AT THE SAME TIME
WHEN ORLANDO ESCAPED FROM RICHMOND THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BUSINESS WAS NOT VERY BRISK
LEWIS WAS DELIGHTED THAT HE HAD MANAGED SO CUNNINGLY TO LEAVE MASTER TOM AND MISTRESS MARGARET AND THEIR SIX CHILDREN TO WORK FOR THEIR OWN LIVING
A COFFIN WAS FINALLY PROCURED AND WILLIAM MORRIS AND ABNER RICHARDSON STARTED WITH IT FOR HIS HOME
THE OWNER OF THE DOG WAS A FARMER
AFTER I GROWED UP TO TEN YEARS OLD THEY MADE ME SLEEP OUT IN AN OLD HOUSE STANDING OFF SOME DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN HOUSE WHERE MY MASTER AND MISTRESS LIVED
EDWARD FELT CERTAIN THAT ONE OF THE PURSUERS RECEIVED A CUT FROM HIS KNIFE BUT THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY WAS UNKNOWN TO HIM
HE WAS FOND OF ACCREDITING HIS RESOLVE TO A VERY AGED RELATIVE WHO IN REMONSTRATING WITH HIM UPON THE SUBJECT REPLIED TO HIS REMARK THAT A SUDDEN CESSATION FROM A PRACTICE SO LONG INDULGED IN MIGHT RESULT IN HIS DEATH
IS IT WONDERFUL THAT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DEEP ABHORRENCE FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS OUTRAGE UPON HUMANITY AND A GENERAL SYMPATHY FOR THE INNOCENT CAPTIVE
THE WHITE MEN WERE INSTANTLY SEIZED WITH A PANIC AND RETREATED

QUITE A NUMBER OF PASSENGERS AT DIFFERENT TIMES AVAILED THEMSELVES OF HIS ACCOMMODATIONS AND THUS SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANADA
BUT IF ACTION MEANS VIVIFYING PUBLIC SENTIMENT DECAYING UNDER INSIDIOUS POISON
THE BOYS MORE SHREWD AND WIDE AWAKE THAN MANY OTHERS DID NOT HEARKEN TO SUCH STUFF THE TWO YOUNGER HEARD THE VIEWS OF THE ELDER BROTHER AND EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW HIM
AT THIS POINT MY SELF-INTEREST MINGLED WITH MY SENSE OF HUMANITY AND I FELT THAT I OCCUPIED A MORE RESPONSIBLE POSITION THAN I SHALL EVER ATTAIN TO AGAIN
FOUR HEAVY LOSSES ON ONE SMALL SCRAP CUT FROM A SINGLE NUMBER OF THE SUN HOW VEXATIOUS
IN THE SUITS FOR THE PENALTIES TURNER OBTAINED JUDGMENT FOR TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GLANDING ONE FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS

HE HAD HEARD THE SLAVEHOLDERS CURSE BOSTON SO MUCH THAT HE CONCLUDED IT MUST BE A PRETTY SAFE PLACE FOR THE FUGITIVE
CONSEQUENTLY HERE IS WHAT WAS RECORDED OF HIM APRIL 3D 1857 AT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STATION JUST BEFORE A FREE TICKET WAS TENDERED HIM FOR CANADA
PHILLIS WAS A WIDOW ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE
OF ANGLO-SAXON BLOOD WAS VISIBLE IN HIS FEATURES AND HIS HAIR WHICH GAVE HIM NO INCONSIDERABLE CLAIM TO SYMPATHY AND CARE
AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU AN ANECDOTE OR TWO OF SOME OF OUR NEW CITIZENS
HE CONCLUDED THAT FOR THIS VERY REASON HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN VALUED AT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE MARKET
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE HOWEVER JEREMIAH'S HEALTH HAD BEEN VERY TREACHEROUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE MASTER HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO RECEIVE ONLY $50 A YEAR SICK OR WELL
BUT KNOWING THAT THE OLD LADY WOULD NOT BE LONG HERE HE JUDGED IT WAS BEST TO LOOK OUT IN TIME
MY HOUSE WAS SITUATED THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE FROM THE ROAD LEADING FROM MIDDLETOWN TO ODESSA THEN CALLED CANTWELL'S BRIDGE ON A CLOSER INSPECTION I NOTICED SEVERAL MEN WALKING BESIDE THE WAGON
NO FELLOW-CITIZENS
IN THIS STATE OF MIND ONE DAY WORD WAS CONVEYED TO HER THAT THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND HAD ARRIVED FROM PHILADELPHIA AND THAT THE STEWARD ON BOARD WITH WHOM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED HAD CONSENTED TO SECRETE HER THIS TRIP IF SHE COULD MANAGE TO REACH THE SHIP SAFELY WHICH WAS TO START THE NEXT DAY

HARPER FROM MARYLAND
AND AFTER CONNECTING HIMSELF WITH IT HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONTENT FOR A WHILE ON THE SCORE OF POLITICAL MATTERS AND TO HAVE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO WHAT HE HAD ADOPTED AS HIS CHIEF PURPOSE IN LIFE
AS WE LOOKED UPON THOMAS GARRETT'S CALM SERENE FACE MATURE IN A RIPE OLD AGE STILL SHADOWING FORTH KINDLINESS OF HEART FIRMNESS OF PURPOSE DISCRIMINATING INTELLIGENCE CONSCIENTIOUS MANLY UPRIGHTNESS DEATH NEVER SEEMED MORE BEAUTIFUL

HE SHOULD PROVE OUR WITNESSES UNWORTHY OF BELIEF

HARDCASTLE ALSO URGED THE SHERIFF TO ADOPT THIS PLAN
ON 1ST DAY MORNING THE BOAT RAN TO CHESTER TO TAKE OUR COLORED PEOPLE TO THE CAMP AT MEDIA
HE WAS TOO SHARP TO BE KEPT IN SLAVERY
HE SPOKE OF HIM AS BEING A BLUSTERING MAN WHO NEVER LIKED THE SLAVES TO MAKE ANYTHING FOR THEMSELVES GEORGE BORE WITNESS THAT THE USAGE WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED HAD BEEN HARD
ANTHONY HAD BEEN SERVING UNDER THE YOKE OF WARRING TALVERT OF RICHMOND VA
AND HON
TIMES GREW WORSE AND WORSE CONSTANTLY
SHE HAS WRITTEN ME TWO LETTERS FROM CANADA AND BY NEITHER OF THEM CAN I ASCERTAIN WHERE SHE LIVES_--HER LETTERS ARE MAILED AT SUSPENSION BRIDGE BUT SHE DOES NOT LIVE THERE AS HER LETTERS SHOW
IS THE PRAYER OF ONE THAT LOVES YOUR SOULS
INDEED THE COMMITTEE RATHER PREFERRED SEEING THE NAMES OF THEIR PASSENGERS IN THE PAPERS AS IN THAT CASE THEY COULD ALL THE MORE CAUTIOUSLY PROVIDE AGAINST MESSRS
I HAVE GLANCED OVER A FEW PAGES OF YOUR HISTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD AND I MOST EARNESTLY COMMEND IT
MOREOVER SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN HAD ESCAPED IN DAYS PAST AND THESE THEY HOPED TO FIND
I SPEAK OF COURSE OF A CONSPIRING TO RESIST A LAW NOT THE MORE LIMITED PURPOSE TO VIOLATE IT OR TO PREVENT ITS APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT IN A PARTICULAR CASE OR AGAINST A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL
SHOULD BE SOLD TO-MORROW UNHESITATINGLY HE STARTED FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND CANADA--AND HIS EFFORTS WERE NOT IN VAIN
BUT WHEN SHE DID SEE HER TRUE CONDITION SHE WAS NOT CONTENT UNTIL SHE FOUND HERSELF ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HE WAS ALSO MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT BEFORE REACHING PENNSYLVANIA HIS FAITHFUL BEAST WOULD NEED FEEDING SEVERAL TIMES AND THAT THEY CONSEQUENTLY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PASS ONE OR TWO NIGHTS AT LEAST IN MARYLAND EITHER AT A TAVERN OR FARM-HOUSE
WILLIAM STILL:--I AM NOW IN SAFETY
HE LEFT BEHIND TWO BROTHERS AND ONE SISTER IN SLAVERY
CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER REQUIRED THAT SHE SHOULD REMAIN IN RICHMOND A NUMBER OF MONTHS FOR THE PURPOSE OF WINDING UP SOME OF HER AFFAIRS
THEY DID SO RETURN AND MCCREARY ALSO RETURNED TO BALTIMORE IN THE SAME CAR HE HAVING LEFT BALTIMORE IN THE CAR IN THE EVENING WITH THE CHESTER COUNTY MEN
THERE IS NO RHETORICAL AMBITION
PLEASE TO LET ME HEAR FROM HIM WITHOUT DELAY FOR MY VERY SOUL IS TRUBLED ABOUT MY FRIENDS WHOM I EXPECTED TO OF SEEN HERE BEFORE THIS HOUR

BUT SOMEHOW THEY HAVE BURNT A HOLE I UNDERSTAND IN THE TOP AND SO I LECTURED INSIDE AND THEY GATHERED AROUND THE FIRE OUTSIDE
TAKE NOTICE I HAVE NO MORE CLAIM ON YOU NOR YOU ON ME FROM THIS TIME MARVELLOUS LIBERALITY
THE BLESSING OF HIM THAT WAS READY TO PERISH CAME UPON ME
THE TRADER THE SLAVE-PEN THE AUCTION-BLOCK THE COFFLE GANG THE RICE SWAMP THE COTTON PLANTATION BLOODHOUNDS AND CRUEL OVERSEERS LOOMED UP BEFORE HIM AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
HAPPY IS THE MAN AND ENVIABLE THE GOSPEL MINISTER WHO LOOKING BACK UPON HIS COURSE IN THE GREAT ANTI-SLAVERY CONTEST CAN RECALL AS THE CHIEF CHARGE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM THAT OF BEING OVER-ZEALOUS
BUT IT WAS IN VAIN TO ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE SAM THAT CANADA OR ANY OTHER PLACE ON THIS CONTINENT WAS QUITE EQUAL TO NEW BEDFORD
DISGUISING HIMSELF HE AGAIN TOOK A STROLL THROUGH THE MARKET LOOKING ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT AS HE PASSED ALONG
GONE TO THY HEAVENLY FATHER'S REST THE FLOWERS OF EDEN ROUND THEE BLOWING
AS TO HIS MISTRESS HE SAID SHE WAS TOLERABLY GOOD ANN WOOD WAS OWNED BY MCVEE ALSO AND WAS OWN SISTER TO ELIZABETH
HOUSTON MARIA JANE 287
WE GIVE IT AS IT STANDS ON THE OLD UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BOOK
THE TALK OF COLD IN THIS PLACE IS ALL A HUMBUG IT IS WORMER HERE THAN IT WAS THERE WHEN I LEFT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER HAS ALLWAYS TREATED ME LIKE THEIR OWN CHILD I HAVE NO FAULT TO FIND IN THEM
RHOADS ELIZ
FORMAN ANTHONY ATKINSON ARTHUR JONES ISAIAH NIXON JOSEPH HARRIS JOHN MORRIS HENRY HODGES
BUT ON THIS OCCASION THERE WAS BUT LITTLE TIME FOR DELIBERATION BUT MUCH NEED OF HASTE TO MEET THE EMERGENCY
HAS A VERY VIGOROUS MIND
BUT STILL RESISTING HE WAS BEATEN MOST UNMERCIFULLY
BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE ARE CONTENTED TO RECEIVE THEM WITH THAT PRIVATE CORDIALITY AND HOSPITALITY WITH WHICH I TRUST WE SHALL ALWAYS RECEIVE STRANGERS WHO VISIT OUR SHORES
BUT HE PERCEIVED THAT HIS OLD MASTER RECOGNIZED HIM AND WAS BENT UPON STOPPING HIM
OF THE LATTER SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO AND TAKE THE SACRAMENT COME BACK AND THE OLD BOY WOULD BE IN HER AS BIG AS A HORSE BELINDA COULD SEE BUT LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER MASTER AND MISTRESS
THAT'S ALL SIR EXCEPT THAT I SAID I WOULD BE ALONG IN THE STAGE
IN 1825 I LIVED THERE

BELIEVE ME EVER TRULY YOURS L.D
SHE ANXIOUSLY WAITS THEIR COMING IN SYRACUSE N.Y
BUT BE IT WHICH IT MAY I PRESUME THEY WILL BE MORE CAUTIOUS HERE HOW THEY TRIFLE WITH SUCH

$200 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SERVICE OF THE REV
THE LAWS WERE WRITTEN
GRANTHAM NANCY 459
HE WAS ALWAYS FULLY AWAKE TO THEIR WRONGS AND LONGED TO BE DOING SOMETHING TO AID AND ENCOURAGE SUCH AS WERE STRIVING TO GET THEIR FREEDOM
MANY SLAVE-HOLDERS FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE LAW IN THIS PARTICULAR AND WERE ALSO EQUALLY POSTED WITH REGARD TO THE VIGILANCE OF ABOLITIONISTS
LEWIS LEE ENOCH DAVIS JOHN BROWN THOMAS EDWARD DIXON AND WILLIAM OLIVER
I CANNOT SHAKE OFF MY ANXIETY FOR THESE POOR CREATURES
A MESSAGE CAME TO ME THAT THERE HAD BEEN A STATE ROOM TAKEN ON THE STEAMER CITY OF RICHMOND FOR MY BENEFIT AND I ASSURED THE PARTY THAT IT WOULD BE OCCUPIED IF GOD BE WILLING
THE WHOLE COMPANY WERE ON THEIR FEET SHOOK HANDS LAUGHED AND REJOICED DECLARING THAT THIS BEAT ALL THEY HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
ALTHOUGH ANDREW WAS BUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE HE THOUGHT THAT PALMER HAD ALREADY HAD MUCH MORE OF HIS VALUABLE SERVICES THAN HE WAS ENTITLED TO AND HE DETERMINED THAT IF HE THE MASTER EVER ATTEMPTED TO CAPTURE HIM HE WOULD MAKE HIM REMEMBER HIM THE LONGEST DAY HE LIVED
IN ALL ITS PARTS IT IS AN EVIDENCE OF THE SAYING THAT TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION THE AUTHOR SCARCELY NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PUBLIC
COULD NOT HELP HER IF I STAID
AND THEN ONLY BECAUSE THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS THERE IN FORCE HOLDING THE REBEL ELEMENTS IN SUBSERVIENCY
PHILADELPHIA MADE NO PLEA FOR THE VIOLATED RHYTHM OF LIFE ON EITHER SIDE
HE HAD ONLY JUST REACHED HIS TWENTIETH YEAR

THEY LOOK FOR FREEDOM AS THE REWARD OF WHAT THEY SHALL NOW DO
IT GATHERS UP THE NATIONAL STATISTICS INTO GROUPS SHOWS HOW NEW MEANING IS REFLECTED FROM THEM THUS RELATED THAT ALL UNITE TO ILLUSTRATE THE SINGLE FACT OF THE SOUTH'S STEADY INCREASE OF POWER HER TIGHTENING GRASP ABOUT THE THROAT OF GOVERNMENT AND HER BUFFETS OF THREAT TO THE NORTH WHEN A WEEDLING PALM FAILED TO PALSY FAST ENOUGH
BUT THE PRO-SLAVERYITES HAD COUNTED WITHOUT THEIR HOST--PASSMORE WOULD NOT YIELD AN INCH BUT STOOD AS FIRMLY BY HIS PRINCIPLES IN PRISON AS HE DID ON THE BOAT
WE SHALL DO ALL WE CAN FOR THEM AND TEACH THEM TO READ AND WRITE AND ENDEAVOR TO PLACE THEM IN A CONDITION TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
ELLIOTT BURWELL A29-EO3T WEST RIVER ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY

PLEASE ANSWER THIS LETTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
IF ANY FANCY ARTICLES ARE SENT ON BOARD I UNDERSTAND HE HAS A PLACE TO PUT THEM IN AND IF HE HAS I SUGGEST THAT HE LIES STILL STILL WAITING FOR FREIGHT TILL THE FIRST ANXIETY IS OVER
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HE MADE EFFORTS BUT ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OR ABOUT THAT LENGTH OF TIME SHE HAS BEEN OWNED BY CHARLES M
BUT HE LOVED THE NAME TOO WELL NOT TO MAKE IT STAND FOR SOME PRACTICAL FACT SOME FEASIBLE AND ORGANIZED EFFORT
FISHER JONATHAN 338

POST OFFICE ADDRESS
WENDELL PHILLIPS LIKEWISE IN THE NATIONAL STANDARD THE EDITOR AARON M
BELONGING TO THE RACE YOUR DEAR HUSBAND REACHED FORTH HIS HAND TO ASSIST I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH YOU
JANE KANE ALIAS CATHARINE KANE AND ROBERT ROSS
MAY HE WHO FEEDS THE RAVENS CARE FOR THEM
ITS POLITICAL BEARING IS THE VERY LEAST AND MOST SUPERFICIAL PART OF IT SCARCELY WORTH NOTICING IN COMPARISON WITH ITS MORAL AND RELIGIOUS RELATIONS
BEING A MAN OF EXCELLENT NATURAL GIFTS AS WELL AS OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR AND DEVOTION TO A REMARKABLE DEGREE HE SEEMED ADMIRABLY FITTED TO REPRESENT THE SLAVE IN CHAINS LOOKING UP TO GOD WITH AN EYE OF FAITH AND AGAIN THE FUGITIVE IN CANADA TRIUMPHANT AND REJOICING WITH JOY UNSPEAKABLE OVER HIS DELIVERANCE YET NOT FORGETTING THOSE IN BONDS AS BOUND WITH THEM
THAT SAD AFFLICTION HE THOUGHT WAS THE CAUSE OF A CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN HER TREATMENT OF HER SLAVES
FOR ONE SO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH BOOKS AS SHE WAS THE CORRECTNESS OF HER SPEECH WAS PERFECTLY ASTONISHING
SAMUEL BURRIS RETURNED TO MY HOUSE EARLY ON THIRD DAY MORNING WITH A LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT GIVING ME A DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE TRANSACTION
SAID MR HENRY
HE SAID THAT HIS MASTER KEPT A GROCERY STORE IN PRATT STREET AND OWNED SIX HEAD OF SLAVES
CATHARINES C.W APRIL 24 1857

WE ARE ALL WELL AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE ALL THE SAME
THE LADIES HERE COMPLAIN THAT THEY CANNOT SELL WHAT THEY MAKE
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT SAID SCOTT
TELL JAMES ORMSTED I WOULD BE GLAD IF HE WOULD SEND ME A PAIR OF THICK HEAVY BOOTS FOR IT RAINS AND HAILS AS OFTEN OUT HERE IN THE SUMMER AS IT DOES THERE IN THE WINTER
AND HIS COUNSEL DAVID WEBSTER ESQ AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT ATTORNEY VANDYKE COMPLETELY IMBUED WITH THE PRO-SLAVERY SPIRIT WERE EQUALLY AS UNYIELDING
ABOUT 27 YEARS OF AGE STOUT AND WELL-MADE QUITE BLACK AND NO FOOL AS WILL APPEAR PRESENTLY
ON THE OTHER HAND IF COOL A SLIGHT SHUDDER MIGHT BE VISIBLE SUFFICIENT TO RAISE A HEARTY LAUGH
UNDER THE CHANGE SUGAR WAS RAISED AND THE SLAVES WERE MADE TO EXPERIENCE HARDER TIMES THAN EVER
OR ONE F THIS MORNING
JACKSON JAS
HE WAS ALWAYS BLUSTERING YOU COULD NEVER DO ENOUGH FOR HIM NO HOW
HERE HE TRIED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PASS FOR WHITE
WILLIAM SAID I DO YOU THINK WE WOULD GIVE HER UP NEVER SAID HE BUT MR HILLIARD IS NOT ONLY OUR FRIEND BUT HE IS A U.S
BUT THE THOUGHT OF FREEDOM ENABLED HER TO KEEP HER COURAGE UP UNTIL THE GLAD NEWS WAS CONVEYED TO HER THAT ALL THINGS WERE READY PROVIDING THAT SHE COULD GET SAFELY TO THE BOAT ON WHICH SHE WAS TO BE SECRETED
THOSE SCENES OF SUFFERING AND MARTYRDOM MILLIONS OF CHRISTIANS WERE CALLED UPON TO PASS THROUGH IN THE DAYS OF THE INQUISITION ARE STILL SUBJECTS OF STUDY AND HAVE UNABATED INTEREST FOR ALL ENLIGHTENED MINDS
MANLY'S ON CLAY ST NEAR 11TH AT ANY HOUR OF THE NIGHT FOR ONE MONTH
IT CONSISTED OF A COLORED MAN A WHITE WOMAN AND A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
I WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE REV
AFTER HE HAD DONE THIS HE SAID
SO I WAS KEPT FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
HE WAS NEVERTHELESS PHYSICALLY A FINE SPECIMEN OF A MAN
MEANS WERE APPROPRIATED TO SEND THEM ON FREE OF COST
KNIGHT MARY 563
THE SLAVE-HOLDERS HAVING FLED SEVERAL NEIGHBORS MOSTLY FRIENDS AND ANTI-SLAVERY MEN GATHERED TO SUCCOR THE WOUNDED AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE DEAD
A SON 14 ALONE THEY THINK 50.00 9
PENNYPACKER WERE COMPANIONS IN ANTI-SLAVERY AND OTHER REFORM LABORS AS WELL AS IN BUSINESS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IT MAKES ME SAD TO THINK OF IT
SUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT JANUARY 1ST 1855
WILLIAM WAS THIRTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF A CHESTNUT COLOR SUBSTANTIAL PHYSICAL STRUCTURE AND OF GOOD FACULTIES
FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS OUT IN THE BITTER COLD WEATHER WITHOUT THE CHANCE OF A FIRE LEFT THEM A PREY TO THE FROST WHICH MADE SAD HAVOC WITH THEIR FEET ESPECIALLY--PARTICULARLY ELIZABETH'S
DURING SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO HER ESCAPE ANNA HAD BEEN HIRED OUT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TREATED A LITTLE MORE DECENTLY THAN HER MISTRESS WAS WONT TO DO
FROM THERE I CAME ON DIRECTLY TO WASHINGTON
IN THE EYES OF THE MISTRESS THIS PROCEDURE WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY THAT SHE BECAME VERY MUCH EXCITED AND FOR A MOMENT THREATENED THEM WITH THE BROOMSTICK BUT HER RAVING HAD NO EFFECT ON MESSRS
HE HAD LEFT HIS FATHER MOTHER AND ONE SISTER BEHIND
HOMELESS IN THE LAND OF OUR BIRTH AND WORSE OFF THAN STRANGERS IN THE HOME OF OUR NATIVITY DURING HER STAY IN YORK SHE HAD FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES OF SEEING PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IT SO HAPPENED HOWEVER BEFORE SHE WAS REMOVED THAT WATTS THE TRADER FAILED IN ORDER TO CHEAT HIS CREDITORS IT WAS SUPPOSED
A WELL-GROWN LAD HOWEVER AND HAD THE ONE IDEA THAT ALL MEN WERE BORN FREE PRETTY DEEPLY ROOTED IN HIS MIND
ASHER W.H
HE URGED THE SOCIETY TO TAKE A LESSON FROM THE DECEASED AND RECOGNIZING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR POSITION TO LABOR WITH EARNESTNESS AND TO CONSECRATE THEIR WHOLE BEINGS TO THE CAUSE OF RIGHT AND REFORM
VINCENT LEFT HIS MOTHER JUDAH SMITH AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS EDWIN ANGELINE SINA ANN ADALINE SUSAN GEORGE JOHN AND LEWIS ALL BELONGING TO THE ESTATE OF SKINNER
THIS WAS THE REASON WHY SHE WAS TO BE SOLD
BLIND TO EVERYTHING BUT HIS ONE LIGHT OF MORAL INSTINCT;--HE BECAME AN ORGAN FOR THE CHARITIES OF THOSE WHOSE SOFTER NATURES LONGINGLY WHISPERED THE CRY BUT COULD NOT DO THE CUT AND THRUST WORK OF DELIVERANCE
YET NO SOONER DID THAT LITTLE SHEET MAKE ITS APPEARANCE THAN THE SOUTH WAS THROWN INTO CONVULSIONS AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BEEN INVADED BY AN ARMY WITH BANNERS
HE FLED FROM WM
THEY WERE WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF HERE ON SIXTH DAY LAST AND BY AGREEMENT I HAD A MAN OUT ALL SEVENTH DAY NIGHT WATCHING FOR THEM TO PILOT THEM SAFELY AS 1,000 DOLLARS REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR FOUR OF THE FIVE
SO AFTER THINKING OF VARIOUS PLANS HE DETERMINED NOT TO RUN OFF AS A SLAVE WITH HIS BUDGET ON HIS BACK BUT TO TRAVEL AS A COACHMAN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A WHITE LADY IN PLANNING THIS PLEASANT SCHEME DAVID WAS NOT BLIND TO THE FACT THAT NEITHER HIMSELF NOR THE WHITE LADY WITH WHOM HE PROPOSED TO TRAVEL POSSESSED EITHER HORSE OR CARRIAGE
THOUGH HE HAD TO CONTEND WITH COUNTLESS DIFFICULTIES HE AT LAST MADE THE DESIRED HAVEN
HE ALLOWED THOMAS TO HIRE HIMSELF FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH AMOUNT HE WAS REQUIRED TO RAISE SICK OR WELL
WE APPROACHED THE ANXIOUS-LOOKING SLAVE-MOTHER WITH HER TWO BOYS ON HER LEFT-HAND
THE ONE SHOT IN THE FOREHEAD IS BADLY MARKED BUT NOT DANGEROUSLY INJURED
I TOLD HIM HALF DOLLAR
HEAR HEAR AND WE MAY FEEL ASSURED THAT THOSE PERSONS IN THE NORTHERN STATES WHO BEFRIENDED THE NEGRO IN HIS BONDAGE WILL NOT NOW FAIL TO ASSIST HIS STRUGGLES FOR A HIGHER POSITION
SPEAKS SLOW WHEN SPOKEN TO
ON THE SIDE OF THE OPPRESSOR THERE IS POWER NOW AS IN THE EARLIER DAYS OF THE WORLD
INSTEAD OF SEEKING PLEASURE IN THE BANJO AS HE WAS WONT TO DO IN VIRGINIA HE NOW FINDS DELIGHT IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH REV
THEY HATED THE NORTH AND I MADE BELIEVE THAT I DID TOO
HE USED UNCLE SAM'S MAIL AND HIS OWN NAME WITH AS MUCH FREEDOM AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA CENTRAL RAIL ROAD INSTEAD OF ONLY A CONDUCTOR AND STOCK-HOLDER ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SHE RESOLVED TO START IMMEDIATELY AND DID SO AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING PENNSYLVANIA
ANN FOUND THAT SHE HAD SIMPLY GOT OUT OF THE FIRE INTO THE FRYING-PAN SHE WAS REALLY AT A LOSS TO TELL WHEN HER LOT WAS THE HARDER WHETHER UNDER THE RUM DRINKER OR THE OLD TIME METHODIST
HE WAS THEREFORE NOT FORGOTTEN IN THE HOUR OF HIS EXTREMITY
SHE WAS OWNED BY THOMAS BALTIMORE WITH WHOM SHE HAD LIVED FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS
THE COMPANY THAT LEFT CAMBRIDGE ON THE 24TH OF OCTOBER MAY BE THUS RECOGNIZED
PHILA AND HE CAN REFER YOU TO A GENTLEMAN WHO KNOWS THE NEGROES
SINCE WE ARE THUS PLACED AND THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE FOR US OF THE FREE STATES BUT TO MEET THE TROUBLE THAT IS UPON US OR BY BASE CONCESSIONS AND COMPROMISES TO BRING UPON OURSELVES A FAR GREATER TROUBLE IN THE NAME OF GOD LET US LET ALL THINGS GO AND CLEAVE TO THE RIGHT
AT SUCH TIMES SHE WAS VERY VIOLENT
I ONLY ADD THAT EVERY CASE OF THIS KIND ONLY TENDS TO MAKE ME ABHOR MY NO THIS COUNTRY MORE AND MORE
FIVE YEARS LONGER SEEMED AN AGE TO HIM
PASSMORE OF SAID COUNTY IN DEFENCE OF TRUTH IN AN EXHAUSTIVE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE VILLAGE RECORD WEST CHESTER OCT
WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM HOW EVENT AFTER EVENT HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR FREEDOM
HER HUSBAND WILLIAM WAS THOROUGHLY COLORED BUT WAS A MAN OF MARKED NATURAL ABILITIES OF GOOD MANNERS AND FULL OF PLUCK AND POSSESSED OF PERCEPTIVE FACULTIES VERY LARGE
AS GLAD AS I SHOULD BE AND AS MUCH AS I WOULD DO FOR THE LIBERATION OF PETER'S FAMILY NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND HIS THREE LIKELY CHILDREN IN WHOM HE PRIDES HIMSELF--HOW MUCH IF YOU ARE A FATHER YOU CAN IMAGINE
BUTCHER WM ALIAS WM
IN ALL HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THE PRISONERS AND THEIR FRIENDS HE PLAINLY SHOWED THAT ALL HIS SYMPATHIES WERE ON THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND NOT WITH THE POPULAR PRO-SLAVERY SENTIMENT WHICH CLAMORED SO LOUDLY AGAINST TRAITORS AND ABOLITIONISTS
I WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME BUT THE DOCTORS CURED ME AT LAST ANDREW REPORTED THAT HE FLED FROM DR DAVID HOUSTON
HE HAD A FIRST-RATE CORN-FIELD EDUCATION BUT NO BOOK LEARNING
WILLIAM STILL:--DEAR SIR:--IN THE ABOVE-NAMED PLACE SOME FIVE YEARS SINCE THERE WAS FORMED A LADIES ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY WHICH HAS PUT FORTH ITS FEEBLE ENDEAVORS TO AID THE CAUSE OF BREAKING EVERY YOKE AND LETTING THE OPPRESSED GO FREE AND WE TRUST THROUGH OUR MEANS OTHERS HAVE BEEN MADE GLAD OF HEART
BY REQUEST HE VISITED THE SEA ISLANDS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DAUGHTER AND ON HIS RETURN MADE A REPORT WHICH SERVED HIS ASSOCIATES AS A BASIS OF OPERATIONS AND WHICH WAS REPUBLISHED EXTENSIVELY IN THIS COUNTRY AND ABROAD
THIS MADE MASTER AND MISTRESS CUSS ALL HANDS AT A GREAT RATE AND MASTER BEAT ALL HANDS EXCEPT THE ONE THAT TOLD
THE FRIENDS OF HUMANITY HAD ASSEMBLED FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO WITNESS THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE CASE
THEN TO BE GIVEN UP TO INDIANIANS TO THESE FIENDISH TYRANTS TO BE SACRIFICED
HE WAS SOON ON THE SPOT
BUT I WANT YOU TO BE A WIDE-A-WAKE
ANNA PORTRAYED HER MISTRESS'S TREATMENT OF THE SLAVES WITH MUCH EARNESTNESS ESPECIALLY WHEN REFERRING TO THE SALE OF HER OWN BROTHER AND SISTER
CASES IN SOME INSTANCES WOULD APPEAL SO LOUDLY AND FORCIBLY TO HUMANITY CIVILIZATION AND CHRISTIANITY THAT IT WOULD REALLY SEEM AS IF THE VERY STONES WOULD CRY OUT UNLESS SOMETHING WAS DONE
D.R
BEING A YOUNG MAN OF PROMISE STEPHEN WAS ADVISED EARNESTLY TO APPLY HIS MIND TO SEEK AN EDUCATION AND TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE ENDEAVOR TO RAISE HIMSELF IN THE SCALE OF MANHOOD MORALLY RELIGIOUSLY AND INTELLECTUALLY
MINISTER TO HAITI THE BOOK MUST STRIKE EVERYONE WHO SEES IT AS ONE OF VERY COMMENDABLE APPEARANCE
I ALSO DEEPLY REGRET THE EXCITEMENT RECENTLY ON THE ACCOUNT OF THOSE SLAVES YOU WILL FAVOR ME BY KEEPING ME POSTED UPON THE SUBJECT
IN THIS WAY HE REACHED WILMINGTON WHERE HE UNFORTUNATELY FELL INTO THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER'S SON WHO RESIDED IN WILMINGTON AND HAPPENED TO DISCOVER JOSEPH IN THE CARS MOST LIKELY HE HAD BEEN TELEGRAPHED TO AND HAD HIM ARRESTED AND RETURNED
ALTHOUGH A YOUNG MAN--ONLY ABOUT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE HIS HEALTH WAS BY NO MEANS GOOD
AND THE ELDER DAMES SO FAR RELAXED THE PURITANIC RIGIDITY OF THEIR RULES AS TO ALLOW THE INVITATION OF AN UNCOMMONLY LARGE COMPANY OF GUESTS TO THE WEDDING IN ORDER THAT A LONG AND PERHAPS LAST FAREWELL MIGHT BE SAID TO THE BELOVED DAUGHTER WHO WITH HER HUSBAND WAS ABOUT TO EMIGRATE TO THE FAR WEST LOUD AND LONG WERE THE LAMENTATIONS AND WARM THE EMBRACES OF THESE SIMPLE-MINDED CHRISTIAN RUSTICS COMPANIONS OF TOIL AND DEPRIVATION AS THEY PARTED FROM TWO OF THEIR NUMBER WHO WERE TO LEAVE THEIR CIRCLE FOR THE WEST
I LEFT BECAUSE I HAD GOT ALONG WITH HIM AS WELL AS I COULD
AT THIS TIME DANIEL GIBBOUS WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD AND HIS WIFE ABOUT TWENTY-EIGHT SHE HAVING BEEN BORN ON THE NINTH OF THE SEVENTH MONTH 1787
IT WOULD OF COURSE BE IMPRUDENT THAT THIS LETTER OR ANY OTHER WRITTEN PARTICULARS BE IN HIS POCKETS FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENT
TO USE HIS OWN WORDS HE SAID
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER AND TWO SISTERS
THE LADY'S NAME SHE LIVES WITH IS A MRS HINE I HOPE I SPELL HER NAME RIGHT HINE AT THE CORNER OF DUKE STREET AND WASHINGTON STREET IN NORFOLK CITY VIRGINIA
LIKEWISE HIS MOTHER BEING VERY OLD HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO GO FREE
BOTH HIS HEAD AND HIS HEART RECOGNIZED THE TERRIBLE WRONGS OF THE ENSLAVED AND THE URGENCY WITH WHICH THEY PRESSED FOR REMEDY
THY WIFE MUST NOT SIT UP WASHING AND IRONING ALL NIGHT AGAIN
AND FURTHER IF I COULD HEAR HIS VOICE IT WOULD FORBID ANY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE ACCOMPLISHED AND ENDURED
BURRIS WHO WAS A FREE MAN FROM KENT COUNTY DELAWARE
AND HE REASONED THAT IF SOME OF THAT WOULD HELP HIM AND HIS BROTHER TO FREEDOM THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN HELPING HIMSELF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
DAVIS NEGRO IS DELIVERED TO YOUR CUSTODY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION AND HEARING FOR TRAVELING WITHOUT A PASS AND SUPPOSED TO BE HELD A SLAVE TO SOME PERSON IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA
THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS CONSTITUTING THE ACTING COMMITTEE ARE A GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE THE CASE HEREAFTER
ESTEEMED FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--I HAVE JUST WRITTEN A NOTE FOR THE BEARER TO WILLIAM MURPHY CHESTER WHO WILL DIRECT HIM ON TO THY CARE
THE LONGER SHE LIVED AND THE MORE FAITHFULLY SHE LABORED FOR THE SLAVE'S DELIVERANCE THE MORE FIRMLY SHE BECAME ROOTED IN THE SOUL-ENCOURAGING IDEA THAT SLAVERY WILL ERE LONG CEASE WHILST THE GREAT MASSES WERE EITHER BLIND OR INDIFFERENT SHE WAS NERVED BY THIS FAITH TO BEAR CHEERFULLY ALL THE SACRIFICES SHE WAS CALLED ON TO MAKE
SHE WAS BROUGHT AWAY SECRETED ON A BOAT BUT THE RECORD IS SILENT AS TO WHICH ONE OF THE TWO OR THREE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAPTAINS WHO AT THAT TIME OCCASIONALLY BROUGHT PASSENGERS HELPED HER TO ESCAPE
AND HE SUCCEEDED
HIS OWN STORY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AS FOLLOWS
ALSO ONE SISTER A SLAVE IN GEORGETOWN
THE WHOLE THRONG KNEW HIM AS THEIR FRIEND
DOCUMENTS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
MANY OF THE SLAVES LEARNED IF THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROSS MASON AND DIXON'S LINE EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE UTTERLY DESTITUTE AND PENNILESS THAT THEY WOULD THEN RECEIVE AID AND PROTECTION FROM THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIM THE BAG TO HOLD ALONE WILLIAM THEREFORE LAID DOWN THE SHOVEL AND THE HOE AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HIS MASTER HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE UNDER THE PRIVACY OF THE NIGHT FOR CANADA
I WILL BE AS HARSH AS TRUTH AND AS UNCOMPROMISING AS JUSTICE
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO SAW THEM WERE ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED THAT THESE CANDIDATES FOR CANADA WOULD PROVE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEIR WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO IN THE USUAL MANNER AND THEY WERE SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING THE COMMITTEE FEELING QUITE A DEEP INTEREST IN THEM
IT BEHOOVED HIM THEREFORE TO AVERT THAT ILL FATE
PROVIDED THAT STEAM PACKETS TRADING REGULARLY BETWEEN THE WATERS OF VIRGINIA AND PORTS NORTH OF AND BEYOND THE CAPES OF VIRGINIA SHALL PAY NOT MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH INSPECTION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT
THIS ARTICLE REPORTED HIMSELF AS HAVING BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY BY DR EPHRAIM BELL OF BALTIMORE COUNTY MARYLAND

SLAVE ENACTMENTS MORE CRUEL
SO PRIVATELY HAD HIS MASTER TRANSACTED BUSINESS WITH THE TRADER THAT THEY WERE WITHIN A HAIR'S BREADTH OF BEING HAND-CUFFED ERE THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE SOLD
WHILE MATTERS WERE THUS FAVORABLE THE LONG STORIES OF INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING AND OF PRACTICES AND CUSTOMS AMONG YOUNG AND OLD MASTERS AND MISTRESSES WERE LISTENED TO ATTENTIVELY ALTHOUGH THE SHORT SUMMER NIGHTS HARDLY AFFORDED SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITING OUT DETAILS
ON REACHING THE COMMITTEE HE MANIFESTED VERY HIGH APPRECIATION OF THE ATTENTION PAID HIM AND AFTER DULY RESTING FOR A DAY HE WAS SENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING
WHO PROFESSED TO BE A GREAT FRIEND OF THE COLORED PEOPLE WAS A TRAITOR
OF THIS FOURTH ARRIVAL HOWEVER THE FOLLOWING INTELLIGENCE WILL DOUBTLESS BE HIGHLY GRATIFYING TO THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM WHEREVER THE LABORS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MAY BE APPRECIATED
AND I BRAKE THE JAWS OF THE WICKED AND PLUCKED THE SPOIL OUT OF HIS TEETH THIS IS AN EXACT PORTRAITURE OF YOUR FATHER A MOST COMPREHENSIVE DELINEATION OF HIS CHARACTER AS A PHILANTHROPIST AND REFORMER
SHE WORKED IN THE HOUSE WITH ME
TO SHOW MERCY IN ANY SENSE TO MAN OR WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE CAUGHT ASSISTING A POOR SLAVE TO FLEE FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE WAS A MATTER NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF IN VIRGINIA
SHE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED KIND TREATMENT IT WAS NOT ON THIS ACCOUNT HOWEVER THAT SHE WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE
HE STATES THAT THEY ROWED SEVEN DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE SKIFF AND GOT SAFE TO HARMONY IND ON THE WABASH RIVER THENCE TO PRINCETON AND WERE CONVEYED TO VINCENNES BY FRIENDS WHERE THEY WERE TAKEN

JOHN CHASE ALIAS DANIEL FLOYD
BUT WHAT RIGHT HAD A NEGRO WHICH WHITE SLAVE-HOLDERS WERE BOUND TO RESPECT MANY WHO HAD BEEN WILLED FREE WERE HELD JUST AS FIRMLY IN SLAVERY AS IF NO WILL HAD EVER BEEN MADE
BUT IN SPEAKING OF HIS PRACTICAL DEALINGS WITH HIS SLAVES GENERAL SAID THAT HE WORKED THEM HARD STINTED THEM SHAMEFULLY FOR FOOD AND KEPT THEM ALL THE TIME DIGGING
I WAS HIS HEAD MAN ON THE PLACE AND HAD EVERYTHING TO LOOK AFTER ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND 1857
BOYS AS THEY WERE WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD THEY HAD WISELY RESOLVED NOT TO REMAIN IN THAT CONDITION
ISAAC HAD A WIFE ELIZA AND THREE CHILDREN ISAAC ESTELLA AND ELLEN ALL OWNED BY FITCHHUGH
HOURS AND HOURS TOGETHER DURING THE TWO OR THREE DAYS OF THEIR SOJOURN SHE SPENT OF HER OWN ACCORD BY HIS BED-SIDE MANIFESTING ALMOST WOMANLY SYMPATHY IN THE MOST DEVOTED AND TENDER MANNER
NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MAN WHO SO COMPLETELY FULFILLED THE SCRIPTURE INJUNCTION TO FORGIVE AN ERRING BROTHER NOT ONLY SEVEN TIMES BUT SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN I HAVE WITNESSED RELAPSE AFTER RELAPSE INTO VICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE MOST HEARTLESS INGRATITUDE TO HIM
$100 REWARD.--RAN AWAY ON THE 11TH INST NEGRO MAN HARRY WISE
HIS NAME WAS BENJAMIN TUCKER A STILL GREATER INCENTIVE HOWEVER MOVED HIM WHICH WAS THAT HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN SOLD SOUTH FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE SINCE WHICH TIME HE HAD HEARD OF HER BUT ONCE AND THAT VAGUELY
BENJAMIN WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE SMALL OF STATURE DARK COMPLEXION OF A PLEASANT COUNTENANCE AND QUITE SMART

TO J.M
NO VERY SERIOUS CHARGES WERE MADE AGAINST LEWIS BUT ON THE CONTRARY THEY SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKED UPON AS A MODERATE SLAVE-HOLDER THEY ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH FOR FIFTY YEARS AND STOOD HIGH IN THAT BODY FURTHERMORE THEY STATED THAT HE SOLD SLAVES OCCASIONALLY
WOULD THE STRONG ARM OF A BROTHER HAVE BEEN WELCOME
YOURS L.E
THEIR DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTY PRESSES AND THE HANGING OF JOHN BROWN AND HIS FRIENDS TO INTIMIDATE MEN FROM THE ADVOCACY OF FREEDOM WILL ALL COME TUMBLING UPON THEIR OWN HEADS AS A JUST RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR OUTRAGEOUS BRUTALITY
HOWEVER THEY WERE ALL DULY CARED FOR AND COUNSELLED TO GO TO CANADA WHERE THEIR RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED BY A STRONG AND POWERFUL GOVERNMENT AND THEY COULD ENJOY ALL THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP IN COMMON WITH ALL THE WORLD AND THE REST OF MANKIND AND ESPECIALLY WERE THEY ADVISED TO GET EDUCATION
AFTER PARTIAL RECOVERY HE MADE HIS WAY TO BALTIMORE AND THENCE TO PHILADELPHIA
HE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO DISGUISE HIMSELF IN SUCH A MANNER AS NOT TO BE RECOGNIZED AND TO MINGLE AMONGST THE RIOTERS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THEIR OBJECTS AND IF POSSIBLE TO CONVEY SUCH INFORMATION TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES AS MIGHT LEAD TO THE ARREST OF THOSE MOST ACTIVE IN FOMENTING DISORDER
WHEREUPON THE POOR FELLOW WAS SENT TO JAIL TO BE TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BUT ABRAM DID NOT WAIT TO HEAR THE VERDICT

THESE MIGHT BE SET DOWN AS FIRST-CLASS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TRAVELERS
I WAR SORY TO HEAR THAT MY BROTHER WAR SOL I AM GLAD THAT I DID COME AWAY WHEN I DID GOD WORKS ALL THE THINGS FOR THE BEST HE IS YOUNG HE MAY GET A LONG IN THE WOLE MAY GOD BLESS HEM EF YOU HAVE ANY NEWS FROM PETERSBURG VA PLAS RITE ME A WORD WHEN YOU ANSER THIS LETTER AND EF ANY PERSON CAME FORM HOME LETTER ME KNOW
IN SPEAKING OF THE FETTERED CONDITION FROM WHICH HE HAD ESCAPED THE NAME OF EPHRAIM SWART A GAMBLER AND SPREE'R WAS MENTIONED AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD WRONGED HIM OF HIS LIBERTY MOST GRIEVOUSLY
I LEFT BECAUSE OF MY MASTER'S MEANNESS TO ME
IN THIS WAY MOSES WAS TAUGHT TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PUNCTUAL
THE VOLUME BEFORE US THOUGH CONTAINING NEARLY 800 PAGES IS NOT ELABORATED BEYOND NECESSITY AND FAIRLY TEEMS WITH INTERESTING SKETCHES
I KNOW FULL WELL THAT IF YOU BEGIN WITH SUCH CASES THERE IS NO BOUNDARY AT WHICH YOU CAN STOP
FRIEND GOODWIN WAS WRITTEN TO IN THE MEANTIME BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE DIRECTLY WITH A VIEW OF MAKING INQUIRES CONCERNING THE STRAY FUGITIVES AND AT THE SAME TIME TO INFORM HER AS TO HOW THEY HAPPENED TO BE COMING IN THE DIRECTION FOUND BY HER
HAD IT BEEN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE AS THEY HAVE DONE
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY CAME FROM MARYLAND
NOT ONE
THEY OUGHT TO BE FITTED OUT FOR CANADA WITH STRONG WARM CLOTHING IN COLD WEATHER AND THEIR SAD FATE ALLEVIATED AS MUCH AS CAN BE THE FORTY-ONE DOLLARS REFERRED TO IN THE ABOVE LETTER AND SENT TO E.M WAS TO GO ESPECIALLY TOWARDS BUYING AN INTERESTING FAMILY OF TEN SLAVES WHO WERE OWNED IN NORTH CAROLINA BY A SLAVE-HOLDER WHOSE RARE LIBERALITY WAS SIGNALIZED BY OFFERING TO TAKE $1,000 FOR THE LOT YOUNG AND OLD
CERTAINLY IN THIS REGION THEY WERE HIGHLY APPRECIATED AND I HOPE THE TIME MAY COME THAT YOUR KINDNESS WILL BE RECIPROCATED WE ARE AL WELL AT PRESENT BUT TIMES CONTINUE DULL
SHE HOWEVER RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE AS SOON AS WE REACHED THE STREET AND WAS VERY FIRM EVER AFTER
TO ESCAPE THIS DILEMMA THE INVENTIVE GENIUS OF ABRAM AND RICHARD SOON DEVISED A SAFE-GUARD AGAINST THE SMOKE
AND TO HAND THESE PRINCIPLES DOWN AFRESH TO SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS
SHE KINDLY SENDS US A LITTLE LETTER NOW AND THEN AGAIN RETURNING HER GLOWING THANKS TO ALL WHO ASSISTED IN PROCURING HER FREEDOM
SO MUCH WERE THESE FRIENDS INTERESTED TO SECURE DICK'S FREEDOM THAT THEY OFTEN CONTEMPLATED BUYING HIM ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF BUYING AS THE MONEY WOULD GO INTO THE POCKET OF THE MASTER WHO THEY CONSIDERED HAD NO JUST RIGHT TO DEPRIVE ANY INDIVIDUAL OF HIS FREEDOM
AT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE I WAS PLACED WITH A YOUNGER SISTER AT THE FRIENDS BOARDING SCHOOL IN DUTCHESS COUNTY STATE OF NEW YORK AND CONTINUED THERE FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS WITHOUT RETURNING HOME
A SHOVEL FULL OF FIRE TO THE GREAT DANGER OF BURNING THE PREMISES WAS SCATTERED OVER THE ROOM
I CAN ONLY REFER TO THE PART I TOOK IN IT FROM MEMORY AND IF I COULD DELINEATE THE ACTUAL FACTS AS THEY OCCURRED THEY WOULD SAVOR SO MUCH OF EGOTISM THAT I SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC
COMPLAINT FROM A SLAVE WAS A CRIME OF THE DEEPEST DYE
UPON LEAVING PHILADELPHIA SHE WENT WITH THE MOST OF HER COMPANY TO BOSTON AND THENCE TO NEW BEDFORD WHERE SHE WAS LIVING WHEN LAST HEARD FROM

YEARLY MY TASK HAD BEEN INCREASED AND MADE HEAVIER AND HEAVIER UNTIL I WAS PRESSED BEYOND WHAT I COULD BEAR UNDER THIS PRESSURE NO HOPE PRESENT OR FUTURE COULD BE DISCERNED EXCEPT BY ESCAPING ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HOW THEY KNEW NOT BUT HE HAD HEARD OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS BOY
THE COMMITTEE RENDERED HER THE USUAL AID AND SENT HER ON DIRECT TO HER HUSBAND IN CANADA
BUT IF AFTER PROCEEDING ON HER VOYAGE SHE RETURNS TO THE PORT OR PLACE OF DEPARTURE OR ENTERS ANY OTHER PORT RIVER OR ROADSTEAD IN THE STATE THE SAID VESSEL SHALL BE AGAIN INSPECTED AND PAY A FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS AS IF SHE HAD UNDERGONE NO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION AND RECEIVED NO PREVIOUS CERTIFICATE
BUT HE VOLUNTARILY ATTESTED THE THOROUGHNESS OF HIS CONVERSION BY PULLING OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDING TO MR MCK
THE WAY IS NOW CLEAR TO PRESENT CAPTAIN F
SOMETIMES NO BODY BUT ME WOULD WORK AND I WAS LOOKED UP TO FOR SUPPORT
MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO START FOR WILMINGTON AND BE PRESENT AT HIS FUNERAL
PLEASE WRITE ME AN ANSWER TO-DAY SO I MAY KNOW HOW TO PROCEED TO-MORROW
ISAAC HIS COMPANION WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE DARK AND IN INTELLECT ABOUT EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
LUCY GARRETT ALIAS JULIA WOOD
SURELY A GOD OF JUSTICE WILL AVENGE THE WRONGS OF THE OPPRESSED
ACCORDING TO ZECHARIAH'S STATEMENT HIS MISTRESS HAD BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE WITH HER SLAVE PROPERTY HAVING LOST FIFTEEN HEAD OUT OF TWENTY IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO THAT BY WHICH SHE LOST ZECHARIAH
I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT THE MARSHALL OF EVANSVILLE RECEIVED A DISPATCH FROM TUSCUMBIA TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM
OF COURSE A SPEEDY ANSWER WAS RETURNED TO HIS NOTE AND HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO BRING THE ELEVEN PASSENGERS ON TO THE COMMITTEE IN BROTHERLY LOVE
MRS HARPER PASSED TWO WEEKS WITH MRS BROWN AT THE HOUSE OF THE WRITER WHILE SHE WAS AWAITING THE EXECUTION OF HER HUSBAND AND SYMPATHIZED WITH HER MOST DEEPLY LETTER TO JOHN BROWN'S WIFE
MANY INTERESTING INCIDENTS OCCURRED AT THE HOME OF MY UNCLE
ON MATILDA'S ARRIVAL AT THE STATION IN PHILADELPHIA SEVERAL OTHER PASSENGERS FROM DIFFERENT POINTS HAPPENED TO COME TO HAND JUST AT THAT TIME AND GAVE GREAT SOLICITUDE AND ANXIETY TO THE COMMITTEE
THEY WOULD BEAT YOU WITH A STICK THE SAME AS A DOG
JOSHUA WAS ABOUT TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF A COARSE MAKE AND A DARK HUE
WHEN I GOT TO SOPT HIS BODY WAS SURROUNDED BY THE POLICEMAN
THE GARRULITY OF THE NORTH PERMITTED ITSELF TO BE SILENCED BY THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES
HIS WIFE AND BOY SHARED FULLY IN HIS AFFECTIONS AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED TO HAVE THEIR FACES TURNED CANADA-WARD
HE DID NOT ADMIT THAT HE LOVED SLAVERY ANY THE BETTER FOR THE REASON THAT HIS MASTER WAS A PREACHER OR THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS THE WIFE OF A PREACHER
GOOD FEATURES
HE WAS A MARRIED MAN BUT EXERCISED NO GREATER CONTROL OVER HIS WIFE THAN OVER HIMSELF
SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES
IN COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE USAGES OF SLAVE-HOLDERS IN THE TWO STATES IN WHICH SHE HAD SERVED SHE SAID SHE HAD SEEN MORE FLOGGING UNDER OLD CHRISTIAN THAN SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEE IN ALABAMA
HE WAS OWNED BY A MAN CALLED JOHN DWA WHO FOLLOWED FARMING AND DRINKING AND WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR WAS DISPOSED TO ILL-TREAT THE SLAVES
AFTER HIS DEATH ABOUT SIX YEARS MISTRESS DIED
MR SMITH HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THE PENITENTIARY BEFORE HE HAD FULLY GAINED THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT AND OTHER OFFICERS
SLAVE-TRADER HALL IS FOILED
CHARLES WAS OWNED BY CATHARINE MENDINE AND WILLIAM BY JOHN P
PLEASE TELL MR BAGNALE I SHALL EXPECT ONE LETTER FROM HIM BEFORE I LEAVE HERE
SMITH'S WIFE IS AT OR NEAR THE PLACE HE CAME FROM AND DOUBTLESS THOMAS COOK KNOWS ALL ABOUT HER CONDITION AND CIRCUMSTANCES
HER RUDE INTELLECT BEING CONSIDERED SHE WAS ENTITLED TO A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT FOR SEIZING THE HORSES AND CARRIAGES BELONGING TO HER MASTER AS SHE DID IT FOR THE LIBERATION OF HER CHILDREN
HENRY 66
BUT JAMES GIBBONS TOLD HIM PROMPTLY THAT NOTHING BUT SILENCE AND GOOD BEHAVIOUR ON HIS PART WOULD PREVENT HIS COMMITMENT FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT
JOHNSON DAVID 168
ARMSTEAD
THESE ARE NOW REVEALED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS WORK AND ARE AS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL AS THE MOST ABSORBING PICTURES OF ROMANCE FROM THE CHRISTIAN RECORDER PHILA THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH WORK PRODUCED BY ANY COLORED MAN IN THE COUNTRY
AND THEY WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO IT MAY REJOICE IF PERADVENTURE THEIR APPEALS AND THEIR COUNSELS HAVE BEEN HITHERTO WITHOUT EFFECT
I NEVER KNOWED ANYTHING ABOUT MY MOTHER OR FATHER BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT MY MOTHER WAS A WHITE WOMAN AND THAT I WAS PUT AWAY TO SAVE HER CHARACTER
TWO GENTLEMEN IN LONDON ARE WRITING MOST WARMLY ABOUT THIS
WITH KIND REGARDS SINCERELY THY FRIEND A.H.R
HIS EXPERIENCE WHEN DEPRIVED AT SIXTY OF EVERY DOLLAR OF HIS PROPERTY FOR HAVING OBEYED GOD RATHER THAN MAN IN ASSISTING FUGITIVES FROM SLAVERY AND THE PROMPTNESS WITH WHICH HIS FRIENDS CAME FORWARD WITH PROFFERED CO-OPERATION FURNISHES A LESSON WHICH ALL SHOULD PONDER WELL
GIVEN UNDER MY HAND AND SEAL AT NEW CASTLE THIS 21ST DAY OF MARCH A.D 1854
AND AFTER THE WAR WHEN APPEALS WERE MADE ON BEHALF OF CONTRABANDS WHO FLOCKED INTO WASHINGTON DAILY IN A STATE OF UTTER DESTITUTION BURRIS WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO PRESENT THE MATTER TO THE COLORED CHURCHES OF SAN FRANCISCO WITH A VIEW OF RAISING MEANS TO AID IN THIS GOOD WORK AND AS THE RESULT A HANDSOME COLLECTION WAS TAKEN UP AND FORWARDED TO THE PROPER COMMITTEE IN WASHINGTON
BUT JUST THERE LAY THE DIFFICULTY AND PAIN OF HIS MISSION
I WAS TRULY GLAD TO LEARN THAT HARRIET TUBMAN WAS STILL IN GOOD HEALTH AND READY FOR ACTION BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE DANGER AT PRESENT THAN HERETOFORE THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITEMENT BELOW IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE ESCAPE OF THOSE EIGHT SLAVES
CHILD 14 MONTHS OLD 155
AND DURING THE PROGRESS OF HANWAY'S TRIAL HER CONSTANT PRESENCE IN THE COURT-ROOM AND HER FREQUENT INTERVIEWS WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ATTESTED HER DEEP ANXIETY AS TO THE RESULT OF THE IMPENDING STRUGGLE
THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE WORTHY OF ESPECIAL NOTE
ALL WERE NOW BENEATH THE DECK THE WELL-FITTING OIL-CLOTH WAS PUT OVER THE HOLE COVERING THE CABIN-FLOOR SNUGLY AND A HEAVY TABLE WAS SET OVER THE HOLE
THE FATHER WAS AN OLD LOCAL PREACHER IN THE METHODIST CHURCH--MUCH ESTEEMED AS AN INOFFENSIVE INDUSTRIOUS MAN
SUSAN BROOKS
JOHN THOUGH A STOUT YOUNG MAN AND HAVING NEVER KNOWN ANY OTHER CONDITION THAN THAT OF SERVITUDE NEVERTHELESS FOUND HIMSELF QUITE UNEQUAL TO THE PRESENT OCCASION
INDEED HE WAS RATHER INCLINED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SLAVERY IF NOT TO DEFEND THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
HARRIET AND ONE OF THE MEN HAD WORN THEIR SHOES OFF THEIR FEET AND I GAVE THEM TWO DOLLARS TO HELP FIT THEM OUT AND DIRECTED A CARRIAGE TO BE HIRED AT MY EXPENSE TO TAKE THEM OUT BUT DO NOT YET KNOW THE EXPENSE
LIFT UP A FEW OF THE THINGS AND YOU WILL FIND IT NEAR THE TOP
RIGHT AWAY HE WENT AND GOT THE COWHIDE AND GAVE ME ABOUT TWENTY OVER MY HEAD WITH THE BUTT
LEFT HIS FATHER IN CHAINS
STILL:--SIR--I TAKE MY PEN IN HAND TO WRITE YOU THEAS FEW LINES TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM WELL AT PRESENT AND HOPE THEAS FEW LINES MAY FIND YOU THE SAME
FLARECE P
IT IS RATHER A WONDER TO ME THAT SO MANY CAN ESCAPE THE MASTERS ARE SO CONTINUALLY WATCHING THEM
HIS BLAMELESS AND HAPPY DOMESTIC LIFE AND HIS HOSPITALITY
THE HUSBAND OF MARY HAD FOR A LONG TIME WANTED HIS OWN FREEDOM BUT DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE
I WANT TO KNOW IN REGARD TO THE CLOTHES THAT I INTEND MAKING
BUT HE KNEW AND FELT IT WITH MORE COMPOSURE THAN HIS FRIENDS COULD SUMMON
HE FOUND AN AGENT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND AFTER SURMOUNTING VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES THIS POINT WAS SETTLED
AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED THAT WHEN ANY PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR IN ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHALL ESCAPE THEREFROM THE PARTY TO WHOM SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR SHALL BE DUE HIS HER OR THEIR AGENT OR ATTORNEY MAY APPLY TO ANY COURT OF RECORD THEREIN OR JUDGE THEREOF IN VACATION AND MAKE SUCH SATISFACTORY PROOF TO SUCH COURT OR JUDGE IN VACATION OF THE ESCAPE AFORESAID AND THAT THE PERSON ESCAPING OWED SERVICE OR LABOR TO SUCH PARTY
THE INCENTIVE TO THIS STEP WAS THE INHUMAN TREATMENT HE WAS SUBJECTED TO
BUT SHE NEVER RAPPED ME FOR I WOULDN'T STAND IT
MORRIS JAMES 316
IF YOU COULD SEE THE REST OF THE FAMILY YOU COULD PICK HER OUT YOURSELF IN THIRTY
UNTIL ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE SHE ESCAPED FROM THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN SHE WAS OWNED BY MRS ELIZABETH LEE OF FAUQUIER CO VA WHO HAD MOVED WITH SARAH TO WILMINGTON
WILLIAM WATKINS AN UNCLE TAUGHT A SCHOOL IN BALTIMORE FOR FREE COLORED CHILDREN TO WHICH SHE WAS SENT UNTIL SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE
THE PERSON TOLD ME OF THIS SAID HE READ IT IN THE NEWSPAPER IF THIS BE SO IT IS AWFULL
CONSEQUENTLY IN A HIGH STATE OF MENTAL DREAD OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION HE CONCLUDED THAT FREEDOM WAS WORTH SUFFERING FOR AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS AS YET UNDER TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE DETERMINED NOT TO REMAIN IN PERRYMANVILLE MARYLAND TO WEAR THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY FOR THE ESPECIAL BENEFIT OF HIS SLAVE-HOLDING MASTER WHOSE NAME WAS INADVERTENTLY OMITTED WILLIAM RINGGOLD FLED FROM HENRY WALLACE OF BALTIMORE
PROBABLY HE FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO GIVE HIM UP NOT EVEN FOR FREEDOM AS LONG AS SHE COULD NOT GO TOO
HOWEVER SHE WILL GET FRIENDS AND FEEL MORE AT HOME BY AND BYE
EMILY FOSTER ALIAS ANN WOOD

MR THOMPSON OF THE FIRM OF MERRIHEW THOMPSON--ABOUT THE ONLY PRINTERS IN THE CITY WHO FOR MANY YEARS DARED TO PRINT SUCH INCENDIARY DOCUMENTS AS ANTI-SLAVERY PAPERS AND PAMPHLETS--ONE OF THE TRUEST FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE WAS COMPOSED AND PREPARED TO WITNESS THE SCENE
ON THIS INFAMOUS ENACTMENT COMBINED WITH A CORRUPTED POPULAR SENTIMENT THE PRO-SLAVERY SIDE DEPENDED FOR SUCCESS
HER NAME WAS MARY ELIZABETH
WE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT
THIS SAD EVENT DEPRIVED HER OF THE HOPE SHE HAD OF BEING PURCHASED BY HER HUSBAND AS HE HAD INTENDED
EVEN THE CHURCH BETRAYED ITS MISSION AND PRACTICALLY AIDED IN STAMPING OUT FROM MILLIONS THE SPIRIT THAT RELATED THEM TO THE DIVINE
HE NEVER ATTEMPTED ORATORICAL EFFECT OR STUDIED HARANGUES
WHAT IS YOUR NAME TO THE OTHER MOURNER LIZZIE SIR WAS THE FAINT REPLY
IT WAS YESTERDAY MORNING
NO WAY WAS OPEN BUT THE OLD ROUTE WHICH LED HARD BY MANY DANGERS AND WAS ONLY ACCESSIBLE NOW AND THEN THROUGH REGIONS WHERE FRIENDS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
PETER DECLARED THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD BUT ONE PREACHER SPEAK AGAINST SLAVERY AND THAT ONE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE SUDDENLY FOR THE NORTH HE SAID THAT A QUAKER LADY SPOKE IN MEETING AGAINST SLAVERY ONE DAY WHICH RESULTED IN AN OUTBREAK AND FINAL BREAKING UP OF THE MEETING
HAVE THEY PRODUCED THE LETTER WRITTEN BY THIS KIDNAPPER SHOWING HOW HE DESCRIBED HER
MR TRAVERSE KNEW WHAT BECAME OF IT
SIT STILL
HIS STATEMENT IS HERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE RECORD BOOK
JOHN WEEMS ALIAS JACK HERRING
LITERATURE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT ALONE THE COMMITTEE SUBSCRIBED FOR IT DAILY AND NEVER FAILED TO SCAN CLOSELY CERTAIN COLUMNS ILLUSTRATED WITH A BLACK MAN RUNNING AWAY WITH A BUNDLE ON HIS BACK

THEY NOW REFUSE TO LET ANY ONE BUT HIS ATTORNEY SEE HIM

THEY LISTENED TO HIS REMONSTRANCES AND RETREATED BEFORE THE MOB HAD REACHED THE BUILDING
13 IT SHALL BE LAWFUL FOR THE COUNTY COURT OF ANY COUNTY UPON THE APPLICATION OF FIVE OR MORE SLAVE-HOLDERS RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THE APPLICATION IS MADE BY AN ORDER OF RECORD TO DESIGNATE ONE OR MORE POLICE STATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES AND A CAPTAIN AND THREE OR MORE OTHER PERSONS AS A POLICE PATROL ON EACH STATION FOR THE RECAPTURE OF FUGITIVE SLAVES
AND HERE I MAY FRANKLY STATE THAT BUT FOR THE HOPE I HAVE ALWAYS CHERISHED THAT THIS WORK WOULD ENCOURAGE THE RACE IN EFFORTS FOR SELF-ELEVATION ITS PUBLICATION NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY ME

GASSWAY CAROLINE 491
HE PROCEEDED TO A PLACE WHERE SOME COLORED MEN WERE WORKING
BUT NOW AND THEN SOME UNPRINCIPLED INDIVIDUALS UNDER VARIOUS PRETENSES WOULD CAUSE US GREAT ANXIETY
WHILE SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATING HIS LIFE AS A SLAVE HE WAS SOON LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO BEND HIS ENTIRE ENERGIES TOWARDS FREEING HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY IF POSSIBLE
NACE ADVERTISED BY MISS SARAH ANN TALBURTT WAS A REMARKABLY GOOD-NATURED LOOKING PIECE OF MERCHANDISE
JOHN HUNN AND THOMAS GARRETT WERE TOO WELL KNOWN AS ABOLITIONISTS TO UNDERTAKE THIS MISSION
THIS CAME FROM A COLORED MAN WHO WAS PASSING THAT WAY
AFTER LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS SHE WAS MARRIED TO A MAN OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE POSSESSING ALL HER GOOD QUALITIES
HAD YOU SEEN A FEEBLE LAMBKIN SHRINKING FROM A WOLF SO BOLD WOULD YE NOT TO SHIELD THE TREMBLER IN YOUR ARMS HAVE MADE ITS FOLD
AND HE WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES WERE NOT UNCOMMONLY STRIPPED NAKED LASHED FLAT TO A BENCH AND THEN HELD BY TWO MEN SOMETIMES FOUR WHILE THE BRUTAL TRADER WOULD STRAP THEM WITH A BROAD LEATHER STRAP THE STRAP BEING PREFERRED TO THE COW-HIDE AS IT WOULD NOT BREAK THE SKIN AND DAMAGE THE SALE
ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE VERY RAPIDLY

THE WOMAN AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN REGULARLY MANUMITTED IN DELAWARE BY THE FATHER OF THE CLAIMANT WHILE THE TITLE OF THE FATHER TO FREEDOM WAS LESS POSITIVE THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO WARRANT A VIGOROUS EFFORT ON HIS BEHALF THE FIRST OBJECT OF THE COUNSEL ON THE PART OF THE ALLEGED FUGITIVE WAS TO PROVE THE MANUMISSION OF THE MOTHER AND CHILDREN AND AS IT WAS THOUGHT THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE COLLECTED AND ARRANGED
FEARING THAT IT WOULD BE PUT INTO EXECUTION JAMES THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER LET NO TIME BE LOST IN GETTING ON TOWARDS CANADA THOUGH HE WAS ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE

AND NOW THE NORTH'S LESSON WAS COMING TO HER--THAT THE SOUL OF A CENTURY'S CIVILIZATION WAS STILL LESS PURCHASABLE THAN THE SOUL OF A SLAVE
HE GAVE HIS MASTER THE CHARACTER OF TREATING HIS SLAVES WITH GREAT SEVERITY
HIS RESOLUTION AND PERSEVERANCE NEVER FALTERED
OH LOVED OF THOUSANDS
HE HAD BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES
VERY RESPECTFULLY YOURS HIRAM WILSON FOR ORLANDO HUNT
HIS OWNER JOHN MITCHELL EVIDENTLY OBSERVED THESE TRAITS IN HIS CHARACTER AND CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS A DANGEROUS PIECE OF PROPERTY TO KEEP

LET US UNSAY THE WORD
FORTUNATELY HOWEVER LETTERS FROM THE GOOD FRIENDS WHO PLUCKED THIS INFANT FROM THE JAWS OF SLAVERY HAVE BEEN PRESERVED TO THROW LIGHT ON THIS LITTLE ONE AND TO SHOW HOW TRUE-HEARTED SYMPATHIZERS WITH THE SLAVE LABORED AMID DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO SAVE THE HELPLESS BONDMAN FROM OPPRESSION

THE IDEA OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PROPERLY PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY RENDERED HIM QUITE UNHAPPY
MCKIM CORRESPONDING SECRETARY AND GENERAL AGENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY ISSUED THE SUBJOINED NOTICE WHICH WAS PUBLISHED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN AND THE COLORED CHURCHES THROUGHOUT THE CITY
HIS MASTER BEING INFORMED OF THE FACT CAME ON AND TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM AGAIN

SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND 1859
BUT AT THE END OF THE FOUR DAYS THIS FRIEND GOT INTO SOME DIFFICULTY AND THUS SHERIDAN WAS LEFT TO WADE THROUGH DEEP WATERS AND HEAD WINDS IN AN ALMOST HOPELESS STATE
MR ROBERT PARRETT OF PARSON KING'S EXPRESS OFFICE HAPPENED TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED AND THINKING PRETTY WELL OF JOSEPH CONFIDENTIALLY PUT HIM IN FULL POSSESSION OF ALL THE FACTS IN THE CASE
WITH WHAT EFFECT MAY BE SEEN FROM THE TWO BRIEF NOTICES AS FOLLOWS
WE THEN MOVED TO ANOTHER HIDING-PLACE IN A THICKET NEAR A FARMER'S BARN WHERE WE WERE SOON STARTLED AGAIN BY A DOG APPROACHING AND BARKING AT US

PERHAPS SOME ONE WHO KNEW HER MORE INTIMATELY THAN WE DID AND WHO IS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF HER LIFE AND LABORS WILL FURNISH US WITH A MORE COMPLETE SKETCH
GROCE
BESIDES THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND JOHN THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE VERY WILLING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE GREAT SAINTS
HOWEVER I RATHER THINK THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT QUIETER
UNDER HIS OLD MASTER THE FAVOR OF HIRING HIS TIME HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
AND WE HAVE NOT ONLY MADE IT MANIFEST THAT SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN BUT WE HAVE CONFIRMED HER CHARTER BY SEPARATE PROOF
THE PRO-SLAVERY PARTY WERE VERY INDIGNANT OVER THE MATTER AND THE HON
SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN SOME STICKING BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE COLORED ONES WERE IN IT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EUFAULA ALA IN DECEMBER 1870 MRS HARPER DID A GOOD WORK AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT TAKEN FROM A LETTER DATED DECEMBER 9TH
ARRIVAL FROM NEW MARKET 1858
THEY SHUT THEIR DOORS AGAINST HIM
MITCHELL U.S
AND FOR AUGHT JIM KNEW SHE WAS PRETTY WELL PLEASED WITH HIM AND THE MONEY ALSO
ALL DOUBTS HAD DISAPPEARED AND A WELL GROUNDED HOPE WAS CHERISHED THAT WITHIN A FEW SHORT DAYS PETER AND HIS FOND WIFE AND CHILDREN WOULD BE REUNITED IN FREEDOM ON THE CANADA SIDE AND THAT CONCKLIN AND THE FRIENDS WOULD BE REJOICING WITH JOY UNSPEAKABLE OVER THIS GREAT TRIUMPH
THIS WILL MORE CERTAINLY ENSURE OUR GETTING THEM
THE SEPARATION--THE ESCAPE OF THE FORMER MANY YEARS PREVIOUS--THE CONTRAST ONE ELEVATED TO THE DIGNITY OF A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY A SCHOLAR AND NOTED CLERGYMAN AND AS SUCH WELL KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN WHILST AT THE SAME TIME HIS BROTHER AND KIN WERE HELD IN CHAINS COMPELLED TO DO UNREQUITED LABOR TO COME AND GO AT THE BIDDING OF ANOTHER

I FORWARD TO YOUR CARE FOR MRS MOORE A FEW WEEKS AGO
THE APPLICATIONS FOR SUCH OBJECTS ARE SO FREQUENT AMONG US IN THE NORTH AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO LIBERALLY MET THAT IT IS NO WONDER IF MANY GET TIRED OF BEING CALLED UPON
HE LEFT HIS FATHER JUDVILLE AND HIS BROTHER JOHN HARRIS BOTH SLAVES
JOE HAD A WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN WHICH WERE AS HEAVY WEIGHTS TO HOLD HIM IN VIRGINIA BUT THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY PREVAILED
IT WAS NOW FIRST DAY SUNDAY AND THE MAN-HUNTERS WERE IN A QUANDARY
THE LAST INFORMATION IS PUBLISHED IN THE TIMES OF YESTERDAY THOUGH QUITE INCORRECT IN THE PARTICULARS OF THE CASE
MATTHEWS TOM 324
BEING A SMART CHATTEL HE REASONED WELL ON THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY AND SHOWED VERY CONCLUSIVELY THAT EVEN UNDER THE KINDEST MISTRESS IT HAD NO CHARMS FOR HIM--THAT AT BEST IT WAS ROBBERY AND AN OUTRAGE
HE FLED FROM WILLIAM WHEELING OF SANDY HOOK MD
ONE OF THEM WAS HIS CHIEF HOUSEKEEPER AND WITH THEM ALL HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS WERE OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO LEAD JAMES AND OTHERS TO THINK AND SAY THAT THEY WERE ALL HIS WIVES OR TO USE JAMES'S OWN LANGUAGE HE HAD THREE SLAVE WOMEN
IF PHILADELPHIANS ARE NOT AROUSED NOW AFTER THIS GREAT STRETCH OF POWER TO CONSIDER THEIR SAFETY THEY MUST BE A STUPID SET OF PEOPLE BUT IT MUST CERTAINLY DO GOOD
THEIR DEEDS OF DARING WINNING VICTORY AT LAST IN THE FACE OF WILY AND UNSCRUPULOUS MEN DEVOTED TO THEIR CAPTURE AND SUSTAINED BY THE VOICE THE LAW AND THE CANNON OF THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BE WRITTEN IN UNFADING LETTERS ACROSS THE HISTORY OF A PEOPLE STRUGGLING UPWARD TO ENFRANCHISEMENT
THIS SAD LETTER MADE A MOURNFUL IMPRESSION AS IT WAS NOT EASY TO SEE HOW HER DELIVERANCE WAS TO BE EFFECTED
ALL THE SLAVES CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION NOTWITHSTANDING THE TEACHING OF SLAVE-HOLDERS ON THE ONE IDEA THAT SERVANTS SHOULD OBEY THEIR MASTERS ETC
YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO SEND ME SOME INFORMATION
NO INCIDENTS OF SLAVE LIFE OR TRAVEL WERE RECORDED SAVE THAT PERRY LEFT HIS WIFE MILKY ANN AND TWO CHILDREN NANCY AND REBECCA FREE ALSO ISAAC LEFT HIS WIFE HESTER ANN LOUISA AND THE FOLLOWING NAMED CHILDREN
SO JUST BEFORE SUNDOWN ONE EVENING HE WAS MISSED
A WOMAN WITH TWO CHILDREN ONE IN HER ARMS AND THE OTHER TWO YEARS OF AGE NAMES ETC NOT RECORDED CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
THIS HE COULD DO CHEERFULLY
THEREBY GOOD MAY COME UNTO THEE AND TO THY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN
WE LEARN THAT ONE PARTY OF THOSE LAST WEEK WERE ATTACKED WITH CLUBS BY SEVERAL IRISH AND THAT ONE OF THEM WAS SHOT IN THE FOREHEAD THE BALL ENTERING TO THE SKULL BONE AND PASSING UNDER THE SKIN PARTLY ROUND THE HEAD

SO FAR AS MESSRS
I HAVE NOT MUCH TO SAY BROTHER BROWN HAS LEFT FOR THE FALLS AND EXPECTS TO RETURN NEXT WINTER
AS IT IS I CAN LEND A PRIVATE LETTER TO A TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND BUT IF BY ANY CHANCE THIS LETTER GOT LOST IT WOULD BE AWKWARD AND IT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE OF COURSE TO LEND THE ORIGINAL IN TWO QUARTERS AT ONCE
ACCORDING TO WILLIAM'S ACCOUNT OF BEALE HE WAS A HARD MAN AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF HIS BLACK PEOPLE THAN HE DID OF DOGS WHEN WILLIAM ENTERED UPON THE UNDERTAKING OF FREEING HIMSELF FROM BEALE'S BARBARISM HE HAD BUT ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY-FIVE CENTS IN HIS POSSESSION
IN THIS RESPECT A GREAT DEAL OF CARE AND TROUBLE HAD TO BE ENDURED FOR THE SAKE OF THE CAUSE
GOOD BYE
THIS WAS PAINFUL FOR THE PARTIES HAD PLENTY OF HOUSE ROOM WERE IDENTIFIED WITH THE OPPRESSED RACE AND ON PUBLIC MEETING OCCASIONS MADE LOUD PROFESSIONS OF DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE OF THE FUGITIVE C

NOTICE OF THE FOURTH PASSENGER UNFORTUNATELY IS MISSING
GRIFFIN JAS ALIAS THOS
SHE HAD MUCH TO SAY OF THE WAYS AND PRACTICES OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
WHILST HIS SKILL BRAVERY AND SUCCESS STAMPED HIM AS ONE OF THE MOST DARING AND HEROIC CAPTAINS EVER CONNECTED WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAUSE
OF COURSE HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS MASTER
TELL MRS STILL TO PRAY FOR ME THAT I MAY GROW IN GRACE AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH AS IT IS IN JESUS
LET THE WHOLE NATION RESOLVE THAT THE WHOLE VIRUS SHALL BE ELIMINATED FROM ITS BODY
SHE LOOKS DOWN WITH PITY AND IF SHE COULD SHE WOULD LOOK WITH SCORN UPON ALL THE PETTY DISTINCTIONS THAT EXIST AMONG MEN
HIS OPPORTUNITIES OF JUDGING HOWEVER HAD NOT BEEN VERY FAVORABLE AS HE HAD NOT BEEN IN HER HANDS A GREAT WHILE
IN PHILADELPHIA
HE IS NO MAN FOR FREEDOM BLESS YOU SAID HARRIET
THE MAN WAS THERE
ADDRESS YOUR OTHER CORRESPONDENT IN ANSWER TO THIS AT YOUR LEISURE
AT ONCE SOME OF THE SLAVES WERE SUSPECTED AND WERE ALL TAKEN TO THE COURT HOUSE AT SERENTOWN ST MARY'S COUNTY
CONSEQUENTLY WITH HIS ORDINARY GIFTS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO UTTER HIS EARNEST FEELINGS WITHOUT MAKING A DEEP IMPRESSION
HIS MECHANICAL GENIUS WAS EXCELLENT SO WERE HIS GEOGRAPHICAL ABILITIES
INDEED HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN USED WELL ALL HIS LIFE NEVERTHELESS RICHARD FELT THAT THIS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS THE GREATEST ROAD HE EVER SAW WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT RICHARD GIRDED ON HIS KNAPSACK AND WENT TO HELP UNCLE SAM HUMBLE RICHMOND AND BREAK THE YOKE

BIRTH-DAY PRESENT FROM THOMAS GARRETT
MOST TRULY CAN I ENTER INTO YOUR SORROWS AND PAINFULLY APPRECIATE THE PANG OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH MUST HAVE FOLLOWED THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE

THE OLDEST IS EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN

THEY KNEW BUT LITTLE HOWEVER CONCERNING EITHER WAY
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN IT BEFORE THEY INQUIRED
TELEGRAPH STATION AT TUSCUMBIA TWELVE MILES FROM THE PLANTATION ALSO AT PADUCAH
BUT I AM SO PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF RANK GENIUS INTELLECT SCHOLARSHIP AND MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WORTH WHICH I SEE BEFORE ME THAT I FEAR I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS YOU EXCEPT WITH A FLUTTERING PULSE AND A STAMMERING TONGUE
THIS DIXON WAS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS RIGHT TO FLOG AND ABUSE HENRY AS HE SAW FIT BUT HE THREATENED TO SELL HIM AS HE WOULD SELL A HOG
BUT I HAVE A PLEASANT TIME
NOW AND THEN OVERFLOWING TEARS WOULD OBSTRUCT THIS DEEPLY THRILLING AND MOST REMARKABLE STORY SHE WAS TELLING OF HER BROTHER BUT HER MEMORY SEEMED QUICKENED BY THE SADNESS OF THE OCCASION AND SHE WAS ENABLED TO RECALL VIVIDLY THE CHIEF EVENTS CONNECTED WITH HIS PAST HISTORY
SAM APPARENTLY WAS ONE OF THE NUMBER WHO HAD BEEN GREATLY WRONGED IN THIS PARTICULAR
WHETHER IT WAS OR WAS NOT SEALED THE WRITER CANNOT SAY IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT SEALED WHEN IT REACHED THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE
LIKE THE NAUTILUS OUTGROWING HIS HOME TO BUILD FOR HIMSELF MORE STATELY TEMPLES OF SOCIAL CONDITION
BURLEIGH WHO WILL BE IN PHILA
BUT HE WAS IN SUCH PERFECTLY GOOD HUMOR WITH EVERYBODY OWING TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS NECK OUT OF THE YOKE THAT HE EVIDENTLY HAD NO DESIRE TO SAY HARD THINGS ABOUT HER
HE WAS MARRIED THE PREVIOUS CHRISTMAS BUT IN THE TRYING HOUR COULD DO NOTHING FOR HIS WIFE BUT LEAVE HER TO THE MERCY OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
I RETURNED A FAVORABLE ANSWER AND SENT LIKENESS AS REQUESTED
INQUIRED HOW DOES THEE FIND IT DANIEL SAID
CHILDREN LEFT TO THE CRUEL MERCY OF SLAVE-HOLDERS COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
ON EXAMINATION HE WAS DEEMED RELIABLE AND A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WAS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN

JUST THEN ANN MARIA TURNED HER HEAD AROUND
WHILE THUS AWAKE TO ALL FORMS OF ANTI-SLAVERY EFFORT HIS HEART AND HAND WERE EVER OPEN TO THE FUGITIVE FROM BONDAGE WHO APPEALED TO HIM AND NONE SUCH WERE EVER SENT AWAY EMPTY

TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON SATURDAY NIGHT NOVEMBER 15TH 1856 JOSIAH AND WILLIAM BAILEY AND PETER PENNINGTON
IT IS TRUE THAT THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY AND KINDRED ASSOCIATIONS RECEIVED LIBERAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A FEW WARM-HEARTED AND STAUNCH ABOLITIONISTS ABROAD TO AID THE GREAT WORK OF ABOLISHING SLAVERY
THE ACCOUNT WAS TOO SICKENING AND THE DESIRE TO HEAR HARRY'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF TOO GREAT TO ADMIT OF FURTHER DELAY
DANIEL BELONGED TO ROBERT CALENDER A FARMER AND EXCEPT WHEN IN A PASSION SAID TO BE PRETTY CLEVER HOWEVER CONSIDERING AS A FATHER THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO DO ALL HE COULD FOR HIS CHILDREN AND THAT ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY DANIEL FELT BOUND TO SEEK REFUGE IN CANADA
DESPITE THE BEAUTIFUL SERMONS HE HAD OFTEN LISTENED TO IN FAVOR OF SLAVERY AND THE MANY WISE LAWS ABOVE ALLUDED TO HE COULD NOT RECONCILE HIMSELF TO HIS CONDITION
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD WORN THE YOKE SHE WAS GENTLE IN HER MANNERS AND HEALTHY-LOOKING SO MUCH SO THAT NO LIFE INSURANCE AGENT WOULD HAVE HAD NEED TO SUBJECT HER TO MEDICAL EXAMINATION BEFORE INSURING HER
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
THEY SCATTERED AND TOOK UP GOVERNMENT LAND
TOM LIKEWISE TOLD THE SAME STORY AND ALTHOUGH THEY USED THE CORN-FIELD VERNACULAR THEY WERE IN EARNEST AND POSSESSED AN ABUNDANCE OF MOTHER-WIT SO THAT THEIR TESTIMONY WAS NOT TO BE MADE LIGHT OF
HERE SHE NOT ONLY HAD TO ENCOUNTER THE TROUBLE OF DEALING WITH UNRULY CHILDREN SHE WAS SORELY OPPRESSED WITH THE THOUGHT OF THE CONDITION OF HER PEOPLE IN MARYLAND
BUT HE JOYFULLY HAILED THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF REPENTANCE AND WAS ALWAYS READY TO GRANT A NEW PROBATION
A MORE GIANT-LIKE LOOKING PASSENGER THAN THE ABOVE NAMED INDIVIDUAL HAD RARELY EVER PASSED OVER THE ROAD
A CERTAIN SPACE NOT FAR FROM THE BOILER WHERE THE HEAT AND COAL DUST WERE ALMOST INTOLERABLE,--THE COLORED STEWARD ON THE BOAT IN ANSWER TO AN APPEAL FROM THESE UNHAPPY BONDMEN COULD POINT TO NO OTHER PLACE FOR CONCEALMENT BUT THIS

HIS ACCURATE LEGAL KNOWLEDGE HIS NATURAL ACUTENESS HIS READY TACT IN AVOIDING DANGEROUS CORNERS AND SLIPPING THROUGH UNSEEN LOOP-HOLES OFTEN GAVE HIM THE VICTORY IN CASES THAT SEEMED HOPELESS TO OTHER MINDS
THE CASE OF EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS
PRIOR TO HIS BEING OWNED BY THE YOUNG MASTER HE HAD LIVED WITH OLD MISTRESS TUNIS
BUT SIR SERIOUS REFLECTION WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE MONEY DEMANDED BY YOU AFTER ALL WILL BE OF AS GREAT A BENEFIT TO YOU AS THE SATISFACTION YOU WOULD FIND IN BESTOWING SO GREAT A FAVOR UPON THOSE WHOSE ENTIRE HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE DEPENDS MAINLY UPON YOUR DECISION IN THE MATTER
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE CHESTNUT COLOR WIDE AWAKE AND A MAN OF PROMISE
HE REPORTED THAT HE FLED FROM JOSEPH BRYANT A FARMER WHO LIVED NEAR PATAPSCO RIVER
WE CONDUCTED HIM NEARLY A MILE TO THE HOTEL WHERE HIS WIFE WAS WAITING FOR HIM LEAVING HIM STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS PURSUED AND THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING HIM TO A PLACE OF SAFETY OR WERE GOING TO BOX HIM UP TO SEND HIM TO CANADA
IT MAY BE A MATTER OF SOME INTEREST TO STATE THAT THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS ADOPTED AT THIS MEETING TOGETHER WITH THE AUTOGRAPHS OF THE SIGNERS IS NOW IN THE KEEPING OF THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY IN THE FOLLOWING SUMMER 1834 HE DELIVERED IN CARLISLE TWO ADDRESSES IN FAVOR OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION WHICH EXCITED MUCH DISCUSSION AND BITTER FEELING IN THAT BORDER COMMUNITY AND GAINED HIM NO LITTLE OBLOQUY WHICH WAS OF COURSE INCREASED WHEN AS A LECTURER ON THE REGULAR STIPEND OF EIGHT DOLLARS A WEEK AND TRAVELLING EXPENSES POCKET LINED WITH BRITISH GOLD WAS THE CURRENT CHARGE HE TRAVERSED HIS NATIVE STATE AMONG A PEOPLE IN THE CLOSEST GEOGRAPHICAL COMMERCIAL AND SOCIAL CONTACT WITH THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY

MRS HARPER IN WRITING FROM KINGSTREE S.C JULY 11TH 1867 IN MIDSUMMER LABORING ALMOST WITHOUT ANY PECUNIARY REWARD GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF A FEARFUL CATASTROPHE WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED THERE IN THE BURNING OF THE JAIL WITH A NUMBER OF COLORED PRISONERS IN IT
LOVEJOY WHO IN THE FREE STATE OF ILLINOIS LAID DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE CAUSE
THIS WAS ENOUGH
AND THUS WITH A ZEAL BEFITTING THE MOST WORTHY OBJECT IMAGINABLE THEY LABORED WITH UNTIRING EFFORT TO CONVICT THE COLORED MEN
IN COMPANY WITH WILLIAM NAYLOR SECRETED IN A VESSEL HE WAS BROUGHT AWAY AND DELIVERED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR AID AND COUNSEL WHICH HE RECEIVED AND THUS ENDED HIS BONDAGE
BUT HETTY WAS A LITTLE SQUEAMISH ON THIS POINT AND TOOK GREAT UMBRAGE AT HER KIND MASTER IN THIS DISOBEDIENT STATE OF MIND SHE DETERMINED IF HARD STRUGGLING WOULD ENABLE HER TO DEFEAT THE THREATS OF MR DANIEL COOLBY THAT HE SHOULD NOT MUCH LONGER HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF ENJOYING THE FRUIT OF THE TOIL OF HERSELF AND OFFSPRING
CO CONSIDERING IT A PRESCRIPTIVE INSTITUTION NOT WORTHY OF HIS CONFIDENCE
THE WHOLE SCENE WAS ONE OF WILD UNGOVERNABLE EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY EXUBERANCE OF JOY
IN ANSWER TO THE FORMER WE WOULD SAY THAT THE STEAMER KEYSTONE STATE LEFT SAVANNAH AT 9 A.M LAST WEDNESDAY
AND IF THE VESSEL BE FORFEITED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT HE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ONE-HALF OF THE PROCEEDS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF THE VESSEL
SHE PRETENDED TO BELONG TO CHURCH TOO SAID GENERAL BUT IT WAS NOTHING BUT DECEIT

THE PASSENGER ABOVE DESCRIBED REACHED THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STATION JUNE 6TH 1857
DEAR FRIEND:--I SENT E.M
272 AND THAT THE PRISONER MAY MEET HIS DUE REWARD--BE THAT WHAT IT MAY
IF I HAD ADVOCATED A DIFFERENT COURSE I COULD HAVE CAUSED THE BURNING OF THE TOWN
LEWIS AND PETER LEFT THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER IN BONDAGE ALSO ONE BROTHER REUBEN AND THREE SISTERS TWO OF WHOM HAD BEEN SOLD FAR SOUTH
SHE HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THE PERSON CLAIMING TO BE HER MASTER SOME FIVE MONTHS
MCHENRY AND MCCULLOCH WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT NEWSPAPERS AND MONEY POSSESSED GREAT POWER AND COULD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BE USED WITH ENTIRE EFFECT
HELPERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AT HOME AND ABROAD--INTERESTING LETTERS
HE THEREFORE HIT UPON A NEW INVENTION ALTOGETHER WHICH WAS TO HAVE HIMSELF BOXED UP AND FORWARDED TO PHILADELPHIA DIRECT BY EXPRESS
WE HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS BUT LITTLE MONEY
FOURTEEN YEARS SHE HAD BEEN THE SLAVE OF A
AND TO PROCLAIM THE DOCTRINES OF THE LIBERATOR IN THE CITY AND BESIDE THE GRAVE OF CALHOUN
JOHN HUNN AND THOMAS GARRETT WERE AS FAITHFUL TO HIM AS BROTHERS
HAMILTON JUNE 22D 1858 C.W
HE WAS GENEROUSLY ASSISTED THROUGH HIS EDUCATION AND TRADE AND WAS PREPARED TO COMMENCE LIFE AT HIS MAJORITY AN INTELLIGENT MECHANIC AND A MAN OF PROMISE
THE WHITE GENTLEMAN HELD OUT HIS HAND AND I WENT TOWARD HIM
SHE ARRIVED SAFELY IN THE QUEEN'S DOMINIONS AND FELT AT LAST THAT SHE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE HELL OF AMERICAN SLAVERY
OF HER WHEREABOUTS NOTHING FURTHER HAD EVER BEEN HEARD
SHE TENDERED MATERIAL AID AS WELL AS HEARTFELT COMMISERATION
AND I FELT THAT IF A COLLISION TOOK PLACE WE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE MADE TO SUFFER THE PENALTY BUT THE MOST VALUABLE PROPERTY IN THE VILLAGE BE DESTROYED BESIDES A PRODIGAL WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE BE THE CONSEQUENCE
SO OFF THEY MOVED TO BALTIMORE
HE HAS BEEN AT WORK IN THE COUNTRY NEAR HERE FOR SOME THREE WEEKS TILL TAKEN SICK
BUT YOU SAY HE SHALL NOT READ HIS WORD CONSEQUENTLY HIS SIN WILL BE UPON YOUR HEAD
JOHN BROWN BEING AT THE BECK OF A MAN FILLING THE SITUATION OF A COMMON CLERK IN THE SHOE STORE OF MCGRUNDERS BECAME DISSATISFIED

BEING ABOUT THIS TIME THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK HE BADE SLAVERY GOOD-NIGHT JUMPED INTO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAR AND OFF HE HURRIED FOR PENNSYLVANIA
MARY ANN THE WIFE OF JAKE WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM WAS A PLEASANT-LOOKING BRIDE
BUT THIS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE MOTIVE WHICH PROMPTED JOHN TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS MASTER
IT IS A CAUSE OF WHICH YOU NEVER NEED BE ASHAMED
YOU WILL FIND AN EXAMPLE AT THE CLOSE OF MY LETTER
THEIR LITTLE CHILD THEY RESOLVED TO CLING TO THROUGH THICK AND THIN
THE JURY MUST HAVE BEEN FIXED FOR THE DEFENDANT TO HAVE SECURED ANY OTHER RESULT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE TESTIMONY ADMITTED OF ANY DOUBT OR QUESTION THE ANTI-SLAVERY MEN IN THE STATE BEING LIKE VIRGIL'S SHIP-WRECKED MARINERS VERY FEW IN NUMBER AND SCATTERED OVER A VAST SPACE

I THOUGHT OF WILLIAM WHO IS A CHRISTIAN PREACHER AND OF THE CHRISTIAN PREACHERS IN PENNSYLVANIA
THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN SO SWEETEN THE BITTER CUP OF MORTALITY WHEN WE SHALL BE CALLED TO DRINK IT NOTHING THAT CAN SO CHEER US IN THE PROSPECT OF PARTING FROM ALL WE LOVE NOTHING THAT CAN SEND SUCH A BLESSED LIGHT ON BEFORE US INTO THE DARK VALLEY WHICH WE MUST ENTER AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FIDELITY TO MAN AND TO GOD
NEAR KIMBERTON IN CHESTER COUNTY PA WAS THE BIRTH-PLACE AND TILL WITHIN A FEW YEARS THE HOME OF THREE SISTERS MARIANN GRACE ANNA AND ELIZABETH R
SPEAKS RATHER SLOW AND HAS WITH HER FOUR CHILDREN VARYING FROM ONE TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
SHE SAID SHE HAS BEEN THREATENED TO BE PUT IN JAIL THREE TIMES SINCE I LEFT ALSO SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE IS WASHING FOR THE CAPTAIN OF A VESEL THAT USE TO RUN TO PETERSBURG BUT NOW HE RUNS TO BALTIMORE AND HE HAS PROMAS TO TAKE HER TO DELAWARE OR NEW YORK FOR 50 DOLLARS AND SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY SHE SENT TO ME AND I SENT HER ALL I HAD WHICH WAS 5 DOLLARS DEAR SIR CAN YOU INFORM ME WHAT TO DO WITH A CASE OF THIS KIND THE CAPTAINS NAME IS THOMAS
WILLIAM STILL:--_DEAR SIR_:--I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT CHARLOTTE GILDES AND MYSELF HAVE GOT ALONG THUS FAR SAFELY
FOR SO FAR FROM FEEDING THE LAMBS OF CHRIST WE ARE EXCITING THE WHOLE ASSOCIATED POWER OF THIS LAND TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING FED
FINALLY ROBERT BECAME SICK OF SUCH TREATMENT AND HE FOUND THAT THE SPIRIT OF CANADA AND FREEDOM WAS UPPERMOST IN HIS HEART
SHE IS PRETTY WELL BUT RATHER DULL
BESIDES THESE LIBERAL PRIVILEGES HIS MASTER WAS IN THE HABIT OF ALLOWING HIM TWO WHOLE DAYS EVERY HARVEST AND AT CHRISTMAS FROM TWENTY-FIVE CENTS TO AS HIGH AS THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS WERE LAVISHED UPON HIM
ON HER WAY TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SHE LOOKED BACK TO SEE WITH KEEN ENJOYMENT MORT CUNNINGHAM FALLING BACKWARD FROM THE FENCE SHE HAD LEAPED
FOLLOWING CLOSELY THE SCRIPTURE ACCOUNT
ON ARRIVING HE NEEDED MEDICINE CLOTHING FOOD AND A CARRIAGE FOR HIS ACCOMMODATION ALL WHICH WERE FURNISHED FREELY BY THE COMMITTEE AND HE WAS DULY FORWARDED TO CANADA
NO RECURRENCE OF INGRATITUDE COULD PARALYZE HIS EFFORTS
I HAVE NOT SEEN THEM YET AND CANNOT CERTAINLY JUDGE WHAT WILL BE BEST
IT INTERPOSES NOT VISIBLY OR BY THE THUNDERBOLT BUT BY INSPIRING AND SUSTAINING HIGH MORAL EFFORT AND HEROIC LIVES
YOU CAN SEND THEM BY EXPRESS OR BY ANY FRIEND THAT MAY CHANCE TO COME THIS WAY BUT BY EXPRESS WILL BE THE SAFEST WAY TO SEND THEM
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION HE LEFT A WIFE AND ONE CHILD BEHIND TO MOURN AFTER HIM
HE WAS SIX FEET THREE INCHES HIGH AND IN EVERY RESPECT A MAN OF BONE SINEW AND MUSCLE
HE KNEW THAT MANY OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED HAD GOT OUT OF BONDAGE SIMPLY BY HARD STRUGGLING AND HE FELT THAT HE COULD DO LIKEWISE
IN ADDITION TO THE AMERICAN EXHIBITORS IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE AMERICAN VISITORS WERE PARTICULARLY NUMEROUS AMONG WHOM THE EXPERIENCED EYES OF BROWN AND THE CRAFTS ENABLED THEM TO DETECT SLAVE-HOLDERS BY DOZENS
THEY LEFT NEITHER OLD NOR YOUNG MASTERS WHOM THEY DESIRED TO SERVE ANY LONGER OR LOOK UP TO FOR CARE AND SUPPORT
OR IF THE MASTER TOLD THE SLAVE THAT THE BLACKS IN CANADA WERE FREEZING AND STARVING TO DEATH BY HUNDREDS HIS HOPE OF TRYING TO REACH CANADA WAS MADE TENFOLD STRONGER
CHARLES HALL JAMES JOHNSON CHARLES CARTER GEORGE AND JOHN LOGAN JAMES HENRY WATSON ZEBULON GREEN LEWIS AND PETER BURRELL WILLIAM WILLIAMS AND HIS WIFE--HARRIET TUBMAN WITH FOUR PASSENGERS
THEY ASKED ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ME
IT WAS ALL DONE UNOBTRUSIVELY IN HIS LIFE
AS SOON AS I CAN RAISE 1,000 DOLLARS I CAN MAKE A BEGINNING AND SOON AFTER YOU WILL SEE THE FREE SOUTH AGAIN AND I TRUST A MUCH HANDSOMER SHEET THAN IT WAS BEFORE NEWPORT JANUARY 6TH 1860
THE WIFE'S NAME WAS HARRIET DELANEY ALIAS SMART STANLEY
MANY OF THEM WERE PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE PRISONER
THEY WENT OUT ALL OVER THE LAND AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIFFUSING MORE TRUTH PERHAPS ABOUT THE DREADFUL SYSTEM OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THAN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY
JAMES FOR CONVENIENCE SAKE WAS SUPPLIED WITH TWO OTHER NAMES MILTON BROWN AND JOHN JOHNSON NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW MANY HE WOULD NEED IN FREEDOM OR WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST ADAPTED TO KEEP HIS WHEREABOUTS THE MOST COMPLETELY VEILED FROM HIS MASTER
THIS INTERFERENCE HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT AND THOMAS WAS NOT SOLD
NOTHING ELSE
TO ME THIS SUBJECT INVOLVES INFINITELY MORE THAN A MERE QUESTION OF HUMANITY
ACCORDING TO SARAH HE WAS A VERY CLEVER SLAVE-HOLDER AND HAD NEVER ABUSED HER
REPLIED
THUS HOPEFUL HE PROSECUTED HIS JOURNEY WITH SUCCESS THROUGH STRANGE REGIONS OF COUNTRY WITH BUT LITTLE AID OR ENCOURAGEMENT BEFORE REACHING PHILADELPHIA
THE TAPPANS WERE SAVED BY HAVING NO SOUTHERN DEBTS
WE ALL KNOW THAT SLAVERY IS VERY WRONG
BUT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES COULD SHE FIND IT IN HER HEART TO BE THANKFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGES OF SLAVERY
THE BLACKS WERE SO EXASPERATED BY HIS THREATS THAT BUT FOR THE INTERPOSITION OF THE TWO WHITE FRIENDS IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE ESCAPED WITHOUT INJURY

THE COMMITTEE WERE INDEBTED TO THE MEDICAL SERVICES OF THE WELL-KNOWN FRIENDS OF THE FUGITIVE DRS
WOULD THAT THE OTHERS HAD ALSO ESCAPED
HOWEVER IN ORDER TO DO EVEN-HANDED JUSTICE TO ALL CONCERNED IT SEEMS BUT PROPER THAT WILLIAM AND JAMES SHOULD BE HEARD FROM AND HENCE A LETTER FROM EACH IS HERE APPENDED FOR WHAT THEY ARE WORTH
INDEED HE THOUGHT SO HIMSELF FOR A LITTLE WHILE
IN SETTING OUT ANNA HAD TO LEAVE HER FATHER JACOB TRUSTY SEVEN SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS
IF ANY DOUBT IT LET HIM COME INTO OUR SCHOOLS OR EVEN CONVERSE WITH SOME OF OUR FREEDMEN EITHER IN THEIR HOMES OR BY THE WAY-SIDE A FEW DAYS LATER SHE GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF A VISIT SHE HAD JUST MADE IN FLORENCE WHERE OUR POOR SOLDIERS HAD BEEN PRISONERS
WITHOUT OWING THANKS TO ANY BODY HE COULD READ AND WRITE PRETTY WELL HAVING LEARNED BY HIS OWN EXERTIONS
BUT SEEING FUGITIVES COMING AND GOING CONTINUALLY SHE FINALLY CONCLUDED TO GO FURTHER NORTH
HE SAID HE DID NOT LEAVE BECAUSE HE WAS TREATED BADLY BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO OWN HIMSELF--TO BE FREE
I TRUST THAT HE HAS GOTTEN MY WIFE'S LETTERS THAT IS IF SHE HAS WRITTEN
FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK THEY WERE OBLIGED TO FARE AS THEY COULD OUT IN THE WOODS OVER THE MOUNTAINS C
THIS IS TO CAUTION BUTLER AND HIS FRIENDS TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
FOR MY AUDIENCES I HAVE BOTH WHITE AND COLORED
JUMPING THE FENCE HE RAN TO A CLUMP OF TREES WHICH OCCUPIED LOW GROUND BEHIND THE HOUSE AND CONCEALING HIMSELF IN IT FOR A MOMENT RAN AND CONTINUED TO RUN HE KNEW NOT WHITHER UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE TOLL GATE NEAR PETERSBURG IN ADAMS COUNTY
WILLIAMS RICHARD 491
NO SOONER HAD THE STEAMER GOT UNDER WAY THAN A HEAVY GALE WAS ENCOUNTERED
I HAVE NOT HAD TIME SINCE I THOUGHT OF IT TO MAKE ANYTHING
AFTER A FEW DAYS AND WITHOUT BEING OFFERED AT PUBLIC SALE HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF JAIL AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CARRIED TO CAMPBELL'S SLAVE PEN IN BALTIMORE WHERE HE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS
GRAY MARY 559
HE WAS A MILITARY MAN AND YOUNG

SO LONG AS DR B
THEY THEN COMMENCED TAKING UP THE HATCHWAYS BUT THE PLACE SEEMED SO SHOCKINGLY PERFUMED WITH FOUL AIR THAT THE MEN STARTED BACK AND DECLARED THAT NOBODY COULD LIVE IN SUCH A PLACE AND SWORE THAT IT SMELT LIKE THE YELLOW-FEVER
FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BULLETIN WE HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO KNOW HOW THE DRAB-COATED PHILANTHROPISTS OF PHILADELPHIA MANAGED TO FURNISH SYSTEMATIC ASSISTANCE TO THE SLAVE FUGITIVES AND THE DESIRE IS NOW GRATIFIED
GEORGE LEFT A FATHER AND THREE SISTERS
THE LAST PLACE HE HAD THE HONOR TO FILL BEFORE ESCAPING WAS WITH MESSRS
I NEVER CHANGED A WORD WITH HER ABOUT THE CASE EXCEPT TO SAY I WAS SORRY TO SEE HER HERE
INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALIZE THAT SHE WAS NOT A BOY EVEN AFTER BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS IN THE CASE
HE OWNS THREE MORE SLAVES BESIDES MYSELF IN ESCAPING SAM WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS WIFE WHO WAS OWNED BY CHRISTIAN BOURDON
ARRIVAL FROM SUSSEX COUNTY 1858
ARRIVAL FROM SUSSEX COUNTY 1858
HOWEVER THE SAME SPIRIT THAT PROMPTED THE EFFORT TO BE FREE MOVED ONE OF THE HEROIC BLACK BONDMEN TO APPLY THE OAR TO THE HEAD OF ONE OF THEIR PURSUERS WHICH STRAIGHTWAY LAID HIM PROSTRATE
HIS DEPORTMENT WAS CERTAINLY VERY REFINED AND GENTLEMANLY
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE EXTENDED TO HIM BROTHERLY KINDNESS SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM DEEPLY AND SENT HIM ON HIS WAY REJOICING
HE THEN DROVE ME DOWN TO THE BLACK FOLK'S HOUSES CABINS OF THE SLAVES HE THEN GOT HIS GUN CALLED THE OVERSEER AND TOLD HIM TO GET SOME ROPES
CATHARINES SEPT
JOHN'S HISTORY IS SHORT
WHEN SHE WENT INTO CLOSE QUARTERS OF CONCEALMENT SHE FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS MEANT AND ALL THE LIABILITIES THERETO
AT THE MEETING OF THE COURT IN THE MORNING THE EXPECTED MESSENGER WAS NOT THERE AND THE INGENUITY OF THE COUNSEL WAS TAXED STILL FARTHER TO PROCRASTINATE THE IMPORTANT PERIOD
BUT THESE LIES HAVE ALREADY EXPLODED AND THE PEOPLE ARE RESUMING THEIR COMMON SENSE AGAIN
I HAD RATHER LOSE MY RIGHT ARM THAN FOR HIM TO GET OFF WITHOUT BEING PUNISHED AFTER HAVING PUT US TO SO MUCH TROUBLE JOSEPH WILL NOW SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
THE WIFE'S NAME WAS LEAR AND THE CHILD WAS CALLED ALEXANDER
WE ARE HOWEVER NOT MORE THANKFUL FOR THE VICTORIES OF FREEDOM IN THE FIELD THAN FOR THE MODERATION AND MERCY SHOWN BY THE VICTORS WHICH HAVE EXALTED AND HALLOWED THEIR CAUSE AND OURS IN THE EYES OF ALL NATIONS
CARR JOHN THOMPSON 449
LOOKING AT IT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE READER TO BELIEVE THAT A SACRIFICE WAS MADE OF THE MAN TO WHOM IT REFERS BY A REPRESENTATIVE CHRISTIAN BODY AND MERELY TO SATE FOR A TIME THE INHUMAN SLAVE-GREED
WHILE THERE HE WAS EMPLOYED TO COOK FOR SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY SLAVES BEING TOLD THAT HE WAS WORKING OUT HIS FINE AND JAIL FEES
SO IN THINKING OVER THE SITUATION HE WAS TAKEN SICK HE FELT THE NEED OF A LITTLE TIME TO REFLECT UPON MATTERS OF VERY WEIGHTY MOMENT INVOLVING HIS FREEDOM
STANLY MILLER 103
WELLS JACK 431
NO CASE EVER SO ENLISTED MY SYMPATHIES
BIRNEY OF ALABAMA A PLANTER AND SLAVE-OWNER WHO LIBERATED HIS SLAVES AND CAME NORTH AND BECAME AS I THINK THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE UPON ABOLITION PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES
CHARLES ROSS WAS CLEARLY OF THE OPINION THAT HE WAS FREE-BORN BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN ILLEGALLY HELD IN SLAVERY AS WERE ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS BY A MAN NAMED RODGERS A FARMER LIVING NEAR GREENSBOROUGH IN CAROLINE COUNTY MD
DAVIS HATH THIS DAY BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE ME THE SUBSCRIBER ONE OF THE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE IN AND FOR THE SAID COUNTY CHARGED UPON THE OATH OF ROBERT HARDIE WITH BEING A RUNAWAY SLAVE AND ALSO AS A SUSPICIOUS PERSON TRAVELING WITHOUT A PASS THESE ARE THEREFORE TO COMMAND YOU THE SAID WM
OUR OBJECT
WILLIAM STILL:--_DEAR SIR_--PLEASE DO ME THE FAVOR AS TO WRITE TO MY UNCLE A FEW LINES IN REGARD TO THE BUNDLE THAT IS FOR JOHN H
MUCH MIGHT BE TOLD CONCERNING THE WARM RECEPTION THEY MET WITH FROM THE FRIENDS OF HUMANITY ON EVERY HAND DURING A STAY IN ENGLAND OF NEARLY A SCORE OF YEARS BUT WE FEEL OBLIGED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT SUFFICE
HE WAS CHIEF ENGINEER ON THE WILMINGTON AND MANCHESTER RAIL ROAD NOT A BRANCH OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RESPONDED RICHARD
IN A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS FROM 1847 TO 1850 I PASSED HUNDREDS TO THE LAND OF FREEDOM WHILE OTHERS INDUCED BY HIGH WAGES AND THE FEELING THAT THEY WERE SAFE IN COLUMBIA WORKED IN THE LUMBER AND COAL YARDS OF THAT PLACE
HENRY TRIED TO PREVAIL ON HIM TO SPOT OUT SAID HOBSON IN THE MARKET AND SEE IF THERE POSSIBLY COULD BE ANY MISTAKE
HIS EXPERIENCE DIFFERED IN NO MATERIAL RESPECT FROM HIS BROTHER'S
GREAT SEARCH WAS MADE AND A LARGE REWARD OFFERED BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
HAVING ARRIVED SAFELY BY THE WAY AND MANNER INDICATED IN E.F
GOOD SERVANTS MAKE GOOD MASTERS
SLAVE-HOLDER IN MARYLAND WITH THREE COLORED WIVES
SLAVE-HOLDER IN MARYLAND WITH THREE COLORED WIVES
THEREFORE PLEASE HOLD ME EXCUSED
IT WAS THEREFORE A GREAT SATISFACTION TO THINK THAT THEIR MOTHERS WHO KNEW FULL WELL TO WHAT A FATE SUCH SLAVE GIRLS WERE DESTINED HAD LABORED SO HEROICALLY TO SNATCH THEM OUT OF THIS DANGER ERE THE CRITICAL HOUR ARRIVED
JOHN EMPHATICALLY WAS ONE OF THIS INJURED CLASS
BEFORE HE HAD PROCEEDED FAR IN HIS STUDIES HOWEVER HE BECAME ALIVE TO THE CLAIMS OF THE PERISHING HEATHEN HERE AT HOME
FOR ONE DOLLAR THE PISTOL BECAME PETE'S PROPERTY
H D.D 659-665
THAT THE MOST REMOTE OF THESE TWO CLASSES STOOD ON THE SAME LEVEL OF BENEVOLENT INTEREST IN HIS MIND HIS WHOLE CAREER MADE OBVIOUS
SHE WILL BE WITH YOU PROBABLY IN THE DAY TRAIN
IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AS IT WAS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE TO ASSIST ALL NEEDY FUGITIVES WHO MIGHT IN ANY WAY MANAGE TO REACH PHILADELPHIA BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS NOT TO SEND AGENTS SOUTH TO INCITE SLAVES TO RUN AWAY OR TO ASSIST THEM IN SO DOING
BUT TO MAKE ASSURANCES DOUBLY SURE AFTER GIVING THEM THEIR SUPPER EVERY EVENING WHICH CONSISTED OF DELICIOUS SKIMMED MILK CORN CAKE AND A HERRING EACH HE WOULD VERY CAREFULLY SEND THEM UP IN THE LOFT OVER THE KITCHEN AND THERE LOCK THEM UP TO REMAIN UNTIL CALLED THE NEXT MORNING AT THREE OR FOUR O'CLOCK TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
HE RESOLVED TO MAKE AN EFFORT WITH THE HANDCUFFS ON
HIS ZEAL AND EARNESTNESS IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM ESPECIALLY IN RENDERING AID TO PASSENGERS KNEW NO LIMIT
SOME OF HIS LETTERS EMBRACING HIS VIEWS PLANS AND SUGGESTIONS WERE SO ENCOURAGING AND SENSIBLE THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SHOWING THEM TO FRIENDLY PERSONS AND INDEED EXTRACTS OF SOME OF HIS LETTERS WERE DEEMED OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO PUBLISH
I WAS STRIPPED ENTIRELY NAKED AND MY FLESH WAS AS RAW AS A PIECE OF BEEF
HE SEEMED TO SEE THE WHOLE MATTER AS I DID AND WAS EMBARRASSED
WILLIAM WELLS BROWN VISITED OUR PLACE A SHORT TIME SINCE RECOMMENDING US TO SEND TO YOU IN PREFERENCE TO SYRACUSE WHERE WE SENT OUR LAST BOX
INDEED THE ORIGINALS HOWEVER UNGRAMMATICALLY WRITTEN OR ERRONEOUSLY SPELT IN THEIR NATIVE SIMPLICITY POSSESS SUCH BEAUTY AND FORCE AS CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS COULD NOT POSSIBLY ENHANCE LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT U.G.R.R
BUT RESPECTING MONEY MATTERS WHEN HIS SLAVES WANTED A TRIFLE HE WAS VERY HARD
REBECCA HAD BEEN HER CHIEF ATTENDANT KNEW ALL HER WHIMS AND WAYS TO PERFECTION
ARE YOU WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
YOU WERE NOT TURNED FROM YOUR PATH OF DEVOTION TO YOUR CAUSE AND TO THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF YOUR COUNTRY BY DENUNCIATION PERSECUTION OR THE FEAR OF DEATH
WHEN ASKED WHAT FIRST PROMPTED HIM TO SEEK HIS FREEDOM HE REPLIED OH MY SENSES
MATILDA MAHONEY--DR J.W
AFTER SOME DISCUSSION IT WAS AGREED FIRST TO FORM A GENERAL COMMITTEE WITH A CHAIRMAN WHOSE BUSINESS IT SHOULD BE TO CALL MEETINGS WHEN NECESSITY SHOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE IT AND TO PRESIDE AT THE SAME
SUCH A STALWART SOUL APPEARS ONLY AT RARE INTERVALS
THERE HAD BEEN SOME VIOLENCE IN THE DISTRICT AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS DID NOT WISH ME TO GO BUT I HAD PROMISED AND OF COURSE I WENT
BUT WE HAVE COME IN WITH A WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE DEMOLISHING THE STRUCTURE HE HAS RAISED RESTORING THE WOMAN TO HER ORIGINAL POSITION IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE LAW
HENRY WAS TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK AND A LITTLE BELOW THE MEDIUM SIZE
PROVIDED THAT NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO VESSELS BELONGING TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OR VESSELS AMERICAN OR FOREIGN BOUND DIRECT TO ANY FOREIGN COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE BRITISH AMERICAN PROVINCES
AFTER BEING IN BOSTON TWO MONTHS HE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE MARKET ONE DAY WHEN TO HIS SURPRISE HE ESPIED HIS YOUNG MASTER CHARLES L
HE STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY HENRY L
HE SAW JUST HOW HE COULD EFFECT THE MATTER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PROBABLE FAILURE
WILLIAM BROWN AND JAMES HENSON CONSIDERING THEMSELVES TRAMPLED UPON BY THEIR FELLOW-MEN UNITEDLY RESOLVED TO SEEK A BETTER COUNTRY
ALL THE WHILE WEARING AN AIR OF UTTER INDIFFERENCE OR RATHER OF ENTIRE COMPOSURE
THEY DEFINED THEIR POSITION BY DECLARING THEMSELVES AS MUCH OPPOSED TO SLAVERY AS EVER BUT WITHOUT SYMPATHY FOR THE ABOLITIONISTS HE DEFINED HIS BY SHOWING HIMSELF MORE OPPOSED TO SLAVERY THAN EVER AND FRATERNIZING WITH THE MOST HATED AND DESPISED ANTI-SLAVERY PEOPLE

STILL IN THE OFFICE OF THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS AT WASHINGTON
CHARLES WAS A FAIR SPECIMEN OF THE CORN-FIELD HAND BUT THOUGHT THAT HE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF IN CANADA
SHE REMAINED SEVERAL DAYS IN THE FAMILY OF A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA FAVORABLY IMPRESSING ALL WHO SAW HER
FORTUNATELY HE WAS POSSESSED WITH MORE THAN AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF MOTHER WIT AND HE SOON COMPREHENDED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
PINE APPLE FACTORY AS USUAL THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE TENDERED AID TO ELIJAH AND FORWARDED HIM ON TO CANADA WHENCE HE WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS
THE MASTER WAS ALONE TO BLAME FOR JOHN'S ESCAPE AS HE PASSED ON HIS THE MASTER'S COLOR

IN SUCH A CASE INSTEAD OF ASSISTING MAJOR RONEY I SHOULD FEEL BOUND TO ASSIST TUCKER WHITE BY THROWING EVERY OBSTACLE THAT I POSSIBLY COULD IN THE WAY OF HIS BEING CARRIED BACK TO VIRGINIA
PREFERRING AS HIS ASSOCIATES THOSE TO WHOM HE LOOKED FOR INSTRUCTION AND EXAMPLE AND AIMING AT A HIGH STANDARD HE WON A POSITION BOTH MENTALLY AND SOCIALLY SUPERIOR TO HIS EARLY SURROUNDINGS
HIS PARENTS AND TWO SISTERS HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE IN NORFOLK TWO BRIEF LETTERS FROM JAMES ONE CONCERNING HIS SWEET-HEART WHOM HE LEFT IN NORFOLK THE OTHER GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HER ARRIVAL IN CANADA AND MARRIAGE THEREAFTER WILL DOUBTLESS BE READ WITH INTEREST
AND JUST IN PROPORTION AS THE MASSES CRIED TREASON
PENNOCK A MAN WHOSE UNBENDING INTEGRITY AND FIRM ALLEGIANCE TO DUTY WERE EQUALLED ONLY BY HIS ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE BROAD CHARITY AND RARE CLEARNESS OF JUDGMENT
TWO OF THEM TOOK THE OARS MANFULLY TO FACE UNCERTAIN DANGERS FROM THE WAVES
HE WAS ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH AND BORE EVIDENCE OF HAVING PICKED UP A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERING HIS OPPORTUNITIES
J.H.H
HE FULLY APPRECIATED THEIR HEROISM AND DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD JOIN THEM IN THE UNDERTAKING AS HE WAS BADLY TREATED BY HIS MASTER WHO WAS CALLED GENERAL WASHINGTON A COMMON FARMER HARD DRINKER AND BRUTAL FIGHTER WHICH KIT'S POOR BACK FULLY EVINCED BY THE MARKS IT BORE
WILLIAM ANSWERING TO THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION ARRIVED SAFELY IN COMPANY WITH THOMAS HARPER ABOUT SIX DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THEIR DEPARTURE FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE
FURTHER LIGHT ABOUT THIS EXCITING CONTEST MAY BE GATHERED FROM A COLORED CONDUCTOR ON THE ROAD IN DELAWARE WHO WROTE AS FOLLOWS TO A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AT PHILADELPHIA
FULL WELL DID HE KNOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS NO HOLIDAY TASK TO ESCAPE THE VIGILANCE OF VIRGINIA SLAVE-HUNTERS OR THE WRATH OF AN ENRAGED MASTER FOR COMMITTING THE UNPARDONABLE SIN OF ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE TO A LAND OF LIBERTY
JAMES CONFESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED VERY KINDLY AND HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO READ BY MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
ON RETURNING TO CHRISTIANA WE FOUND THAT THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL FROM THE CITY HAD ARRIVED AT THAT PLACE ACCOMPANIED BY COMMISSIONER INGRAHAM MR JONES A SPECIAL COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES FROM WASHINGTON THE U.S
GEORGE HOWEVER WAS NOT AMONG THIS HOPEFUL NUMBER CONSEQUENTLY HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD START IN TIME AND WOULD BE READY TO SHOUT FOR FREEDOM QUITE AS SOON AS ANY OTHER OF HIS FELLOW-BONDMEN
SIX FUGITIVE SLAVES FROM VIRGINIA WERE ARRESTED AT THE MARYLAND LINE NEAR HOOD'S MILL ON CHRISTMAS DAY BUT AFTER A SEVERE FIGHT FOUR OF THEM ESCAPED AND HAVE NOT SINCE BEEN HEARD OF
THE CAUSE WAS SAFE IN SUCH CAREFUL HANDS
THEY WERE HIS TROPHIES AND THIS NOBLE ACT OF FRANK'S SHOULD EVER BE HELD AS A MEMORIAL AND HONOR
IN THIS CONNECTION IT SEEMS BUT FITTING TO ALLUDE TO CAPTAIN LEE'S SUFFERINGS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BROUGHT AWAY IN A SKIFF BY SEA A PARTY OF FOUR ALLUDED TO IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SINGLE MONTH'S REPORT
AS A PLAYER ON THIS INSTRUMENT HE HAD BECOME QUITE GIFTED BUT MUSIC IN RICHMOND WAS NOT LIBERTY
ONE OF OUR BEST ANTI-SLAVERY SPIRITS
HE PAUSED A WHILE AND MR P
THE WIDOW HEARD JOHN'S PLAUSIBLE STORY AND SAW NOTHING AMISS IN IT SO SHE CONSENTED THAT HE SHOULD WORK ON A SCHOONER
IN THIS STATE OF MIND AS IN THE CASE OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS THEY SET OUT FOR A FREE STATE AND IN DUE TIME REACHED PENNSYLVANIA AND THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE TO WHOM THEY MADE KNOWN THE FACTS HERE RECORDED AND RECEIVED AID AND COMFORT IN RETURN
HE SOON NOTIFIED HIS BROTHER WHO LIVED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY AND BOTH PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF HARM'S WAY
THESE THEY EXPECTED BUT ALL WERE OVERCOME AND THEY REACHED THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA SAFELY AND WERE CORDIALLY WELCOMED
PETE SAID THAT HIS MASTER WAS NOT A HARD MAN BUT THE MAN TO WHOM HE WAS HIRED GEORGE MATTHEWS WAS A VERY CRUEL MAN I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE PENITENTIARY AS IN HIS HANDS WAS HIS DECLARATION
THE FIRST THING TO BE ATTENDED WAS TO SEND A MESSENGER TO THE PLACE WHERE THE FUGITIVE WAS AT WORK WITH A VIEW OF SECURING HIS SAFETY
BELIEVING THEM TO BE FUGITIVES HE SPREAD THE ALARM AND SOME EIGHT OR TEN PERSONS GATHERED ROUND TO ARREST THEM
THEN HE SAID HE HAD TWO SMALL HOUSES WORTH FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS
CAMDEN JUNE 13 1858
WE HAVE HEARD MISS DICKINSON AND DO NOT HESITATE TO AWARD THE PALM TO HER DARKER COLORED SISTER IN 1856 DESIRING TO SEE THE FUGITIVES IN CANADA SHE VISITED THE UPPER PROVINCE AND IN A LETTER DATED AT NIAGARA FALLS SEPT
IN THIS SITUATION HE MADE KNOWN HIS CONDITION TO A FRIEND OF HIS WHO WAS IN A PRECISELY SIMILAR SITUATION
THAT IN GENERAL THEY WERE THRIFTY AND ECONOMICAL ONE MAN FOR INSTANCE WHO SPENT SEVERAL YEARS WITH THEM HAVING ACCUMULATED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BEFORE HE WENT ON TO CANADA
THE NEWS HAD ALREADY GONE OUT THAT THE TRIAL WOULD COME OFF AT THE TIME FIXED
OCCASIONALLY JOHN'S MIND WOULD BE REFRESHED BY HIS MASTER RELATING THE HARD TIMES IN THE NORTH THE GREAT STARVATION AMONG THE BLACKS ETC
A MAN LEFT HERE TWO DAYS SINCE WITH CARRIAGE TO MEET THEM THIS SIDE OF THE CANAL BUT OWING TO SPIES THEY DID NOT REACH HIM TILL 10 O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT

CAPTAIN LAMBDIN SPOKEN OF IN THOMAS GARRETT'S LETTER HAD IN THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART BROUGHT AWAY IN HIS SCHOONER SOME UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS ARRESTED AND THRUST INTO PRISON IN NORFOLK VA TO AWAIT TRIAL
I HOPE AND EXPECT THERE ARE MANY FRIENDS OF THE CAUSE WHO FURNISH CLOTHING IN THE CITY
I AM GETTING EVEN WITH HER NOW FOR I WAS IN THE POOR HOUSE FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND HAVE JUST GOT OUT

JOE IS ABOUT 5 FEET 10 INCHES IN HEIGHT OF A CHESTNUT COLOR BALD HEAD WITH A REMARKABLE SCAR ON ONE OF HIS CHEEKS NOT POSITIVE ON WHICH IT IS BUT THINK IT IS ON THE LEFT UNDER THE EYE HAS INTELLIGENT COUNTENANCE ACTIVE AND WELL-MADE
MY DEAR SIR SUPPOSE I WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
YOUNG 223
HE WAS THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE--A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE AND QUITE INTELLIGENT
THE COMMITTEE'S BRIEF RECORD MADE ON THEIR ARRIVAL RUNS THUS
FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS I HAD TO LOOK THE FIERCE AND UNRELENTING HOSTILITY OF MY COUNTRYMEN IN THE FACE WITH FEW TO CHEER ME ONWARD
WHAT MOST REDOUNDS TO THE HONOR AND PRAISE OF MR GARRETT IN THIS TRANSACTION AS A NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED PHILANTHROPIST IS THAT AFTER THE FUGITIVES HAD BEEN DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY UNDER THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN ADVISED BY HIS LAWYER WHO WAS ALSO HIS PERSONAL FRIEND TO KEEP HIS HANDS OFF AND LET THE PARTY WORK THEIR OWN PASSAGE TO A HAVEN OF FREEDOM NOT THEN FAR DISTANT OR HE MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN SERIOUS TROUBLE HE DELIBERATELY REFUSED TO ABANDON THEM TO THE DANGER OF PURSUIT AND CAPTURE
HIS INFLUENCE UPON MEN AND THE TIMES HAS BEEN LESS AS A SPEAKER THAN AS A WRITER AND PERHAPS STILL LESS AS A WRITER THAN AS AN ORGANIZER A CONTRIVER OF WAYS AND MEANS
AS A SPECIMEN OF THIS ARTICLE OF COMMERCE HE EVINCED CONSIDERABLE INTELLIGENCE
HAVE HAD IT GOOD ALL MY LIFE ETC THIS WAS A REMARKABLE CASE AND AT FIRST SOMEWHAT STAGGERED THE FAITH OF THE COMMITTEE BUT THEY COULD NOT DISPUTE HER TESTIMONY CONSEQUENTLY THEY GAVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
THAT WAS YOU PRAYING TO ME TO BE CAUTIOUS HOW I WRITE DOWN SOUTH
MCKIM AND WM
LAVINA ANN'S COMPANION WAS THE WIFE OF JAMES WOOLFLEY
THERE THEY PROCURED HORSES AND A SLED AND STARTED WITH THE BODY BUT WHEN WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA LINE THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY A MESSENGER WITH A REQUISITION FROM THE GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND TO RETURN THE BODY TO BALTIMORE COUNTY IN ORDER THAT AN INQUISITION AND POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION MIGHT BE HELD IN LEGAL FORM
FOR THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT THE OVERSEER MIGHT SEE FIT TO MAKE AGAINST ANY OF THE SLAVES SHE WOULD TELL HIM TO SELL THEM"--"SELL MR MORGAN HE WOULD TREAT THEM WORSE THAN HE WOULD ANY DOG
MOSES THE MEEKEST MAN ON EARTH LED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OVER THE RED SEA BUT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO SEE THEM SETTLED IN CANAAN
SUCH A FRIEND AS WAS ESTHER MOORE DURING THESE MANY DARK YEARS OF KIDNAPPING SLAVE-CATCHING MOB VIOLENCE AND BITTER PREJUDICE WHICH THE COLORED PEOPLE WERE WONT TO ENCOUNTER SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
STEPHEN TAYLOR CHARLES BROWN CHARLES HENRY HOLLIS AND LUTHER DORSEY
THE LATTER WAS RECEIVED AND SHE WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH IT BUT HE NEVER HEARD OF HER HAVING RECEIVED HIS LIKENESS
LET BE LET BE
IN COMMON WITH MANY OF THE SLAVES HE SMARTED SEVERELY UNDER HIS HEAVY OPPRESSION AND FELT THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO AN OLD RULE WHICH HAD BEEN ONCE TRIED UNDER PHARAOH--NAMELY WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE BRICKS WITHOUT STRAW BUT MOSES WAS NOT A FIT SUBJECT TO SUBMIT TO BE RULED SO INHUMANLY
11TH MO
JOHN WAS THE SO-CALLED PROPERTY OF JOSHUA O'BEAR A FRACTIOUS HARD-SWEARING MAN AND WHEN MAD WOULD HIT ONE OF HIS SLAVES WITH ANYTHING HE COULD GET IN HIS HANDS JOHN AND HIS COMPANION MADE THE LONG JOURNEY ON FOOT
SUSAN WHO WAS IN MARY'S CHARGE WAS AN INVALID CHILD OF FOUR YEARS OF AGE WHO NEVER WALKED AND WHOSE MOTHER HAD ESCAPED TO CANADA ABOUT THREE YEARS BEFORE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH OBLIGED HER TO LEAVE THIS CHILD THEN ONLY A YEAR OLD
BUT THEY ADDED TO THEIR FAITH PATIENCE AND THUS FINALLY SUCCEEDED
HE ALLEGED THAT HE HAD BEEN USED HARD
COLLINS NATHAN AND WIFE MARY ELLEN 108
LUNDY AFTER YOU HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH
BUT AS STRONG AS IT WAS HE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT CONSENT TO REMAIN IN SLAVERY ANY LONGER
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SO-CALLED MASTER WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS FLIGHT
TO WRITE IT FULLY WOULD REQUIRE A VOLUME
MRS JANE E
HER GENERAL APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT NATURE HAD FAVORED HER PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY ALTHOUGH BEING SUBJECTED TO THE DRUDGERY OF SLAVE LIFE WITH NO ADVANTAGES FOR DEVELOPMENT SHE WAS SIMPLY A LIVING TESTIMONY TO THE CRUSHING INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY--WITH A HEART NEVER FREE FROM THE SADDENED RECOLLECTION OF THE AUCTION BLOCK ON WHICH ALL OF HER CHILDREN HAD BEEN SACRIFICED ONE BY ONE CELIA THE SISTER ALSO BELONGED TO D

I WAS MARRIED THAT YEAR
HE LEFT HIS FATHER MOTHER AND SEVEN SISTERS AND ONE BROTHER ALL SLAVES
WHAT MR WILSON DID SAID OR THOUGHT ABOUT THESE SHIFTLESS CREATURES WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO SAY
THIS PARTY IN ORDER TO GET OVER THE ROAD AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THEIR MASTER'S HORSES AND WAGON AND MOVED OFF CIVILLY AND RESPECTABLY
GENEROUS-HEARTED ABOLITIONISTS NOBLY GAVE THEIR GOLD IN THIS WORK
FOR I HAVE WATCHED HIS CAREER WITH NO COMMON INTEREST EVEN WHEN I WAS TOO YOUNG TO TAKE MUCH PART IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS
A MORE ACTIVE AND WIDE-AWAKE YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY YEARS OF AGE COULD NOT EASILY BE FOUND AMONG THE ENSLAVED
DO ME THE FAVOR TO GIVE MY LOVE TO ALL INQUIRING FRIENDS
BUT HE WAS BY NO MEANS CONQUERED AS HE DELIBERATELY GAVE THE COURT TO UNDERSTAND IN A MANLY SPEECH DELIVERED WHILE STANDING TO RECEIVE HIS SENTENCE
FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS HE LABORED IN THIS FIELD WITH COMMENDABLE ZEAL AND ACCEPTABLY GATHERING YOUNG AND OLD IN DAY AND SUNDAY-SCHOOLS AND ALSO ORGANIZING CHURCHES
SHAKE OFF THE DUST O RISING RACE
AS QUICK AS THOUGHT HE FEIGNED THE BARK OF A SAVAGE DOG ACCOMPANIED WITH A FURIOUS GROWL AND SNARL WHICH HE WAS CONFIDENT WOULD FRIGHTEN THE BOY HALF OUT OF HIS SENSES AND CAUSE HIM TO DEPART QUICKLY FROM HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT
SHE WAS REPORTED AS HAVING MADE AN INCENDIARY SPEECH AND ARRESTED CRUELLY SCOURGED AND THEN BRUTALLY HUNG
ESPECIALLY WHEN SPEAKING OF SAMUEL MYERS FROM WHOM HE ESCAPED HE DID NOT HESITATE TO GIVE HIM THE CHARACTER OF BEING A VERY HARD MAN WHO WAS NEVER SATISFIED NO MATTER HOW HARD THE SLAVES MIGHT TRY TO PLEASE HIM
MR GRIMES OF WHICH HE IS A PROMINENT MEMBER AND IN OTHER FIELDS OF USEFULNESS TENDING TO ELEVATE AND BETTER THE CONDITION OF SOCIETY GENERALLY
IN FLEEING FROM BONDAGE IN MARYLAND DAVIS WAS INDUCED TO STOP AS MANY OTHERS WERE IN PENNSYLVANIA
UP TO THE TIME OF HIS ESCAPE JOHN HAD SHUNNED ENTANGLING HIMSELF WITH A WIFE
STARTLED AT HEARING THAT HE WAS TO BE SOLD HE WAS LED TO CONSIDER THE PROPRIETY OF SEEKING FLIGHT VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IF WHILE TRAVELING GENTLEMEN EITHER POLITELY OR RUDELY SHOULD VENTURE TO SCRAPE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE YOUNG PLANTER IN HIS DEAFNESS HE WAS TO REMAIN MUTE
I KNOW THE ALLEGED FUGITIVE
THE CELL IN WHICH HE WAS CONFINED FOR FORTY-NINE DAYS AND FROM WHICH HE WAS LIBERATED ONLY BY THE SPONTANEOUS LIBERALITY OF ARTHUR TAPPAN A PERFECT STRANGER TO HIM HE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF RESEEKING AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR IN COMPANY WITH JUDGE BOND BUT THE PRISON HAD BEEN REMOVED

INDEED IT ONLY SERVED TO STIR THEM UP TO RENEWED DILIGENCE AND WATCHFULNESS ALTHOUGH FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AFTERWARDS THE COMMITTEE FELT DISPOSED WHEN SENDING TO AVOID NEW YORK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND IN LIEU THEREOF TO SEND VIA ELMIRA WHERE THERE WAS A DEPOT UNDER THE AGENCY OF JOHN W

FROM THE FACT THAT FOUR OF SUSAN'S SISTERS HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY TO PARTS UNKNOWN SHE WAS NOT PREPARED TO RELISH THESE ALMOST DAILY THREATS FROM HER IRRITABLE MISTRESS SO SHE BECAME AS ANXIOUS FOR A TRIP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AS WAS HER HUSBAND
PARENTS BROUGHT THEIR LITTLE ONES TO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING AND AS THEY GAZED UPON THE FEATURES OF THE DEPARTED NOW INANIMATE IN DEATH THEY TAUGHT THEIR INFANT MINDS THE IMPRESSIVE LESSON THAT BEFORE THEM WERE THE MORTAL REMAINS OF ONE WHO HAD DEVOTED HIS ENERGIES TO THE DISENTHRALMENT OF THEIR RACE AND WHOSE MEMORY THEY SHOULD EVER CHERISH WITH GRATITUDE AND REVERENCE

THOUGH THE ORDINARY STEPS RELATIVE TO MARRIAGE AS FAR AS SLAVES WERE ALLOWED HAD BEEN COMPLIED WITH NEVERTHELESS ON THE ROAD TO CANADA THEY AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE MORE PERFECT WAY OF HAVING THE CEREMONY PERFORMED AND WENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING

THE COMING OF THE ABOVE NAMED WAS DULY ANNOUNCED BY THOMAS GARRETT
HE HAD FOUR SISTERS IN THE HANDS OF CLARGART BUT WHAT COULD HE DO FOR THEM BUT LEAVE THEM TO PROVIDENCE
AND WHEN YOU WRITE OUT THE HISTORY OF WEEMS ESCAPE AND IT IS PUBLISHED THAT YOU WOULD SEND HIM A COPY OF THE PAPERS

HE FELT THE INJUSTICE OF HAVING TO TOIL HARD TO SUPPORT A DRUNKARD AND GAMBLER
HE YIELDED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE LIQUOR HE HAD IMBIBED AND FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP
HE HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THOMAS COOK DATED THE 6TH OF JUNE BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME REACHING HIM

IT IS A WORK OF TIME A LABOR OF PATIENCE TO BECOME AN EFFECTIVE SCHOOL TEACHER
BUT GOD CAN WAIT AND SURELY I MAY
INDEED MANY OF THE FUGITIVES THEMSELVES LOOKED UPON ME WITH JEALOUSY AND EXPRESSED THEIR INDIGNATION AT MY EFFORTS TO HAVE THEM REMOVED FROM PEACE AND PLENTY TO A LAND THAT WAS COLD AND BARREN TO STARVE TO DEATH
SHE DETERMINED TO ESCAPE
THE FOLLOWING LETTER TELLS ITS OWN STARTLING AND MOST PAINFUL STORY
FURNESS FOR SIMILAR REASONS HE FELT OBLIGED TO MAKE BUT BARE REFERENCE TO HIS WONDERFUL AGENCY IN RELATION TO PETER'S FAMILY ALTHOUGH HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE FACTS IN THE CASE
BUT TO BID GOOD-BYE TO MY OLD MOTHER IN CHAINS WAS NO EASY JOB AND IF MY DESIRE FOR FREEDOM HAD NOT BEEN AS STRONG AS MY DESIRE FOR LIFE ITSELF I COULD NEVER HAVE STOOD IT
OF COURSE THE COMMITTEE NEVER LEARNED HOW MATTERS WERE SETTLED AFTER JAMES LEFT BUT IN ALL PROBABILITY HIS WIVES NANCY AND MARY SISTERS AND LIZZIE WITH ALL THE CHILDREN HAD TO BE SOLD
ROBERT STATED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT HE FLED FROM JOHN R
WHILE THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS RENDERED IN SUCH CASES IMMEDIATE PROTECTION AND AID THEY NEVERTHELESS FELT IN VIEW OF THE IMMINENT DANGERS EXISTING UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW THAT PERSONS DISPOSED TO THUS STOP BY THE WAY SHOULD BE VERY PLAINLY GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY WERE CAPTURED THEY WOULD HAVE THEMSELVES THE MOST TO BLAME
AS SOON AS THE HOUSE WAS OPENED IN THE MORNING THESE MEN WHO WERE LURKING WITHOUT HAVING A CARRIAGE IN WAITING IN THE STREET ENTERED ON THEIR HORRID ERRAND
FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS THE DESIRE TO SEEK LIBERTY HAD BEEN FONDLY CHERISHED AND NOTHING BUT THE WANT OF A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY HAD DETERRED HIM FROM CARRYING OUT HIS DESIGNS

IN THIS SITUATION AUNT HANNAH REMAINED SEVERAL YEARS HONEST FAITHFUL AND OBLIGING TAKING CARE OF HER EARNINGS WHICH WERE PUT OUT AT INTEREST FOR HER BY HER FRIENDS
I HIRED HER FOR THE YEAR 1848 AS A HOUSE SERVANT
HOWBEIT HE POSSESSED THE FAITH REQUISITE AND WAS VICTORIOUS
SOMETIMES SHE TREATED HER SLAVES PRETTY WELL WAS THE TESTIMONY OF ANSAL
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS NOT ABLE TO DO IT
HIS FAITH IN AN OVERRULING PROVIDENCE WAS COMPLETE
I HAVE SEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUR U.G.R.R

YOU ADVISE CAUTION TOWARDS MR P
WIFE SUSAN AND CHILDREN OLIVER SABEY WASHINGTON DANIEL JONAS HARRIET MOSES AND ROSETTA THE LAST NAMED HE HAD NEVER SEEN
ANTHONY AND ALBERT BROWN
THUS HATING SLAVERY HEARTILY GEORGE WAS ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN FAVOR OF CANADA
THEIR WORK WAS NOT A MERE RESULT OF WILL NOT AN OUTCOME OF FACULTY NOT AN UNSUPPORTED IMPULSE OF HEART
THE REASON OF THE EXCITEMENT IS
OH THAT HER VOICE COULD BE HEARD BY THE MILLIONS
IT IS A MOST TOUCHING AND BEAUTIFUL BOOK AND WE THINK SHOULD BE EITHER REPRINTED IN ENGLAND OR SENT OVER HERE VERY LARGELY
SHE WENT TO WORK AND GOT TEN DOLLARS A MONTH
IN SPECIAL CASES YOU MIGHT ADVISE ME BY TELEGRAPH THUS
I RECOLLECT THAT ONE MORNING ON REACHING MY OFFICE THAT OF THE TREASURER OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION MY ASSISTANT TOLD ME THAT IN THE INNER ROOM WERE EIGHTEEN FUGITIVES MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAD ARRIVED THAT MORNING FROM THE SOUTH IN ONE COMPANY

WITH THESE REFLECTIONS WEIGHING UPON HIS MIND HAVING STAYED AWAY FROM HIS WIFE AS LONG AS HE COULD CONTENT HIMSELF TO DO HE TOOK HIS CARPET-BAG IN HIS HAND AND TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD ALABAMA TO EMBRACE HIS FAMILY IN THE PRISON-HOUSE OF BONDAGE
A FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW-BREAKING CAPTAIN BY THE NAME OF B WHO OWNED A SCHOONER AND WOULD BRING ANY KIND OF FREIGHT THAT WOULD PAY THE MOST WAS THE CONDUCTOR IN THIS INSTANCE
CHAPLIN
BUT HE SET HIS FACE HOPEFULLY TOWARDS CANADA AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF STOPPING SHORT THEREOF
IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT SHE HAD DECIDED NEVER TO WEAR THE YOKE AGAIN
FROM A REPORT OF THE FIRST DAY'S HEARING WE COPY A SHORT EXTRACT AS FOLLOWS
THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER RESIDING NEAR BLADENSBURG PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MARYLAND ON SATURDAY NIGHT THE 22D OF MARCH 1856 MY NEGRO MAN TOM MATTHEWS AGED ABOUT 25 YEARS ABOUT 5 FEET 9 OR 10 INCHES HIGH DARK COPPER COLOR FULL SUIT OF BUSHY HAIR BROAD FACE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES BROAD AND SQUARE SHOULDERS STANDS AND WALKS VERY ERECT THOUGH QUITE A SLUGGARD IN ACTION EXCEPT IN A DANCE AT WHICH HE IS HARD TO BEAT

IN LESS THAN SEVEN MONTHS AFTER JACKSON HAD SHAKEN OFF THE YOKE TO THE UNSPEAKABLE JOY OF THE FATHER ISAAC AND EDMONDSON SUCCEEDED IN FOLLOWING THEIR BROTHER'S EXAMPLE AND WERE MADE HAPPY PARTAKERS OF THE BENEFITS AND BLESSINGS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA
HE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS WRONGS TO THESE PHYSICIANS WHO TRIED TO BUY HIM
MADE THE SAME OBJECTION TO HAVING HIS WIFE TAKEN TO MR ELLIS GRAY LORING'S HE ALSO BEING A FRIEND AND A COMMISSIONER THIS DEED OF HUMANITY AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY IS WORTHY TO BE COMMEMORATED AND CLASSED WITH THE ACT OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN AS THE SAME SPIRIT IS SHOWN IN BOTH CASES
CURTIS MARY 339
THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED HIM AS A TRUE AND HONEST FRIEND OF FREEDOM AND AS SUCH AIDED HIM
AFTERWARDS I BEGAN TO GET BETTER AND WAS THEN KEPT PRIVATELY--WAS STRICTLY WATCHED DAY AND NIGHT
LEWIS TAPPAN
HE COULD NOT LOOK ON AND SEE THOSE FOR WHOM HE WAS SO DEEPLY INTERESTED THREATENED ALMOST WITH EXTERMINATION WITHOUT AN EFFORT FOR THEIR PRESERVATION AND YET HE WAS AWARE THAT HIS PRESENCE AMONGST THE MOB MIGHT SUBJECT HIM TO ASSASSINATION WITHOUT ADDING TO THE SECURITY OF THE OBJECTS OF HIS SOLICITUDE
$100 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER NEGRO SLAVE EDGAR
DARIUS THE SUBJECT OF THIS SKETCH WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY-ONE WHEN HE ARRIVED
AND FOR THEM SHE MANIFESTED KINDLY FEELINGS
IN APPEARANCE HE WAS NOT BEHIND ANY OF HIS COMRADES
IN THIS AS IN OTHER RELATIONS OF LIFE SHE WAS OBEDIENT TO THE REVELATION OF GOD IN HER OWN SOUL AND A WORTHY EXAMPLE OF FIDELITY TO HER CONVICTIONS OF DUTY
THAT BETRAYED HIM LET ME KNOW IF MRS GOODWIN OF SALEM ARE AT THE SAME PLACE YET--JOHN AUSTIN ARE WITH US
NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY AVOID THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE MOTHERS WITH THEIR HANDSOME DAUGHTERS WERE VALUED ON THE LEDGER OF THEIR OWNERS AT ENORMOUSLY HIGH PRICES
I WISH YOU WOULD SEND ME WORD IF MR SMITH IS ON THE BOAT YET--IF HE IS PLEASE WRITE ME WORD IN YOUR NEXT LETTER
THIS THEY CONSIDER A GREAT FAVOR TO THE OLD GRANDMOTHER IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO HE CURSED HER AND THREATENED HER WITH A FLOGGING

STILL:--ALL SIX CAME SAFE TO THIS PLACE
SO IT BECAME GRACE ANNA'S PROVINCE ESPECIALLY AFTER THEIR MOTHER'S DEATH TO STAND A SHELTER BETWEEN HER AND WHATEVER WOULD UNPLEASANTLY AFFECT HER BY ITS CONTACT
FROM THOMAS GARRETT--G.A
HE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE SAFE UNDER THE FLOOR
AS WILLFULLY AS THEY HAD THUS MADE THEIR WAY ALONG THEY HAD NOT FOUND IT SMOOTH SAILING BY ANY MEANS
WASHINGTON OR BALTIMORE OR EVEN WILMINGTON DEL WERE NAMES WHICH STOOD FAIR IN THE EYES OF VIRGINIA
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT I DID NOT GIVE HIM A MORE DEFINITE ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
THIS FATE SHE FELT BOUND TO AVERT IF POSSIBLE AND THE WAY SHE AIMED TO DO IT WAS BY ESCAPING ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT JANUARY FIRST 1855
CLARISSA WAS OWNED BY MRS BROWN AND MRS BURKLEY OF PORTSMOUTH UNDER WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS SERVED
INDEED SHE FIRST PROMPTED HER HUSBAND TO ESCAPE
I HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM MY NAME BUT WITH REGARD TO JOE I HAD NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN
THE OTHERS WERE ALL DEAD
HE PROCURED THEIR TICKETS AND HAD THEM DRIVEN BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE DEPOT CHARGING THEM TO KEEP TOGETHER AND TAKE THEIR SEATS IN THE CARS AT ONCE
COULD HE HAVE DONE SO HE WAS PERSUADED THAT HE MIGHT MANAGE TO MAKE HIS WAY ALONG SAFELY
HIS FRIEND CHARLES HE FELT COULD BE CONFIDED IN THEREFORE HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD BROACH THE QUESTION OF CANADA AND THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TO HIM
SHE DICK THOUGHT WAS PRETTY FAIR HE SAID THAT NO SLAVE HAD ANY REASON TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER THAN HARD TIMES UNDER HIS MASTER ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND KNOWN SINCE HE HAD BEEN IN THE INSTITUTION AND HE FANCIED THAT HIS CHANCES FOR OBSERVATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY AS GOOD AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SLAVES
ALTHOUGH UNTUTORED HE HAD MIND ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT POSTLY HAD NO RIGHT TO OPPRESS HIM AND WRONG HIM OUT OF HIS HIRE
THE DENIAL OF HIS MANHOOD NERVED HIM TO SEEK FOR REFUGE IN A FOREIGN CLIME
GIVE MY LOVE TO ALL INQUIRING FRIENDS AND TO YOUR FAMILY ESPECIALLY
I WAS TO CARRY THE SLAVES BACK FROM VIRGINIA
TO BE APPLIED THE INTEREST OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ABOVE MENTIONED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ALONE FOR CHILDREN OF BOTH SEXES OF COLOR IN CANADA APART FROM ALL SECTARIAN OR TRADITIONAL DOGMAS WHICH IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR THE RISING GENERATION

DELIBERATELY JANE AROSE AND ANSWERED IN A LADY-LIKE MANNER TO HER NAME AND WAS THEN THE OBSERVED OF ALL OBSERVERS
WHEREFORE HE CANNOT HAVE THE BODIES ETC
HE HAD EXERCISED HIS AUTHORITY TO ITS UTMOST LIMIT IN SUPPORT OF THE CLAIMS OF HIS SLAVE-HOLDING FRIENDS AND HAD GIVEN THE INFLUENCE OF HIS STATION AND CHARACTER TO BOLSTER UP THE PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
THE FARMER AND HIS FAMILY FELT THEMSELVES EXCEEDINGLY HONORED BY THE VISIT FROM THE DISTINGUISHED DOCTOR AND MANIFESTED A MARKED WILLINGNESS TO SPARE NO PAINS TO RENDER HIS NIGHT'S LODGING IN EVERY WAY COMFORTABLE
THE FACT THAT HE HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO RESENT THE HARSH TREATMENT OF ONE ALBERT LEWIS A SMALL FARMER WHO CLAIMED TO OWN HIM SHOWED THAT HE WAS BY NO MEANS A HOPELESS CASE
THE NAME OF HER MISTRESS WAS ELIZA HAMBLETON AND SHE LIVED IN WASHINGTON
IN THIS WAY A GREAT AMOUNT OF INTERESTING INFORMATION WAS LEARNED FROM WILLIAM RESPECTING THE GOVERNOR SLAVES ON THE PLANTATION IN THE SWAMPS ETC
IT WAS THE NORTH STAR TO MANY A FAINTING HEART
HE STATED THAT SARAH MARIA PERKINS WAS HIS MISTRESS IN MARYLAND
MY LOSS IS $550 INSURED $350
BUT I CANNOT NOW
AND SO THE GRAND INQUEST AFORESAID UPON THEIR OATHS AND AFFIRMATIONS AFORESAID DO SAY THAT HE THE SAID JAMES JACKSON AS MUCH AS IN HIM LAY DID THEN AND THERE IN PURSUANCE AND IN EXECUTION OF THE SAID WICKED AND TRAITOROUS COMBINATION AND INTENTION WICKEDLY AND TRAITOROUSLY BY MEANS OF FORCE AND INTIMIDATION PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF THE SAID LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE SAID STATE AND DISTRICT

CLERGYMEN WITH THEIR BLACK CLOTHES AND WHITE CRAVATS ARE QUITE AS MONOTONOUS AS THE QUAKERS WHATEVER MAY BE THE ABSTRACT MERIT OF THIS ARGUMENT IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE SIMPLICITY OF LUCRETIA MOTT'S NATURE IS BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED BY HER HABITUAL COSTUME
THE SLAVE-HOLDERS REGARDING HIM WITH MUCH SUSPICION WATCHED HIM CLOSELY AND WERE IN THE HABIT OF BREATHING OUT THREATENINGS AND SLAUGHTER VERY FIERCELY AT TIMES
THE GENERAL RULE IS IN RICHMOND FOR A WEEK'S BOARD SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS IS ALLOWED

I CAN GIVE HIS CHARACTER RIGHT ALONG HE WAS A PERFECT DEVIL
BUT WE WERE AWAKENED ONLY IN TIME TO SEE HER BORNE OFF BY THREE WHITE MEN RUFFIANS INDEED TO A CARRIAGE AT OUR DOOR AND IN AN INSTANT SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO THE SOUTH
AND I DO HOPE THAT OUR FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK WILL ASSIST HER TO MAKE UP THE FULL AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE BOY
CATHARINE JONES AND SON HENRY ETNA ELIZABETH DAUPHUS AND GEORGE NELSON WASHINGTON
THE ONLY CLAIM THE OWNERS OF THE KEYSTONE STATE OR THE CAPTAIN CAN HAVE ON SALT WATER DAVIS IS FOR HALF PASSENGER FARE
IN THIS BUSINESS IT WAS HIS DUTY TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THE WORK DONE BY HIM WHICH RECORD HE SHOWED TO HIS MASTER AT THE END OF THE WEEK
MCLANE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OF HARD SERVICE AND FOR BEING DEPRIVED OF EDUCATION
ALTHOUGH A YOUNG MAN ONLY TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE AND QUITE STOUT HIS FAIR COMPLEXION WAS DECIDEDLY AGAINST HIM
I AM GLAD TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS LEAVES ME WELL
THE RECENT DEATH OF THOMAS GARRETT CALLED FORTH FROM THE PRESS AS WELL AS FROM ABOLITIONISTS AND PERSONAL FRIENDS SUCH UNIVERSAL EXPRESSIONS OF RESPECT FOR HIS LABORS AS A PHILANTHROPIST AND ESPECIALLY AS AN UNSWERVING FRIEND OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THAT WE NEED ONLY REPRODUCE SELECTIONS THEREFROM IN ORDER TO COMMEMORATE HIS NOBLE DEEDS IN THESE PAGES

WHEN THERE HE WROTE BACK TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW HOW HE WAS FARING THE NARROW ESCAPE HE HAD ON THE WAY AND LIKEWISE TO CONVEY THE FACT THAT ONE NAMED RACHEL LEFT BEHIND SHARED A LARGE PLACE IN HIS AFFECTIONS
SHE WAS FROM BALTIMORE AND WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE TO KEEP FROM BEING SOLD
DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I WRITE TO INFORM YOU THAT MISS MARY WEVER ARRIVED SAFE IN THIS CITY
SHE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE OF A BROWN COLOR AND SMART AND WAS OWNED BY THE DAUGHTER OF THE WIDOW HUTCHINSON

WITH HIS NAME THE BLANKS WERE FILLED UP
THANKSGIVING DAY NOV 1855
MARVELLOUS INCONSISTENCY AND UNPARALLELED ASSURANCE
HIS WONDERING EYES GAZED UNTIL HE WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT IT WAS THE LORD'S DOINGS AND IT WAS MARVELLOUS IN HIS EYES
A DISPROOF OF SKEPTICISM THROUGH THE GATHERED FORCES OF THE SOUL
A BRIGHT AND PROMISING GIRL HAD BEEN RESCUED FROM THE UNTOLD MISERIES OF A SLAVE WOMAN'S LIFE AND FOUND A GOOD HOME WHERE SHE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE AN EDUCATION AND BE TRAINED FOR A USEFUL AND HAPPY LIFE
MANY HEARTS WERE SAD IN VIEW OF THE DOOM WHICH THEY FEARED WOULD FALL UPON HIM FOR OBEYING A HUMANE IMPULSE HE HAD PUT THE GIRLS ON THE CARS BUT WITH THE RAIL ROAD COMPANY IT WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER
WHY THE REPORTER MADE SUCH GLARING MISTAKES MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE GROUND THAT THE BOLD STAND MADE BY THE FUGITIVES WAS SO BEWILDERING AND ALARMING THAT THE ASSAILANTS WERE NOT IN A PROPER CONDITION TO MAKE CORRECT STATEMENTS
WILL FIND FRIENDS WHO CAN ADVANCE THE AMOUNT REQUIRED
BEING ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE
HER FRIENDS WERE OF COURSE TO AID HER AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HER ESCAPE
HIS SON WHO WAS VERY RECKLESS HE WOULD FREQUENTLY ALLUDE TO AND DECLARED THAT HE THE SON SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS PROPERTY THESE DYING SENTIMENTS FILLED DANIEL WITH GREAT HOPES THAT THE DAY OF HIS ENSLAVEMENT WAS NEARLY AT AN END

IT WAS DOUBTLESS THE MOST IMPORTANT TRIAL THAT EVER TOOK PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY RELATIVE TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS AND IN ITS RESULTS MORE GOOD WAS BROUGHT OUT OF EVIL THAN CAN EASILY BE ESTIMATED
CONSEQUENTLY SHE BEGAN TO COGITATE HOW SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER MISTRESS CATHARINE GORDON AND REACH A FREE STATE
LAW AND ORDER WERE LAID WASTE AND THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE LOOKED ON SOME PERHAPS WITH DISMAY AND OTHERS WITH INDIFFERENCE WHILE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS WERE PROSTRATED AND THEIR PEACEFUL AND QUIET HOMES INVADED BY THE HAND OF VIOLENCE
IN THE FIRST SHE DOES NOT EVEN SIGN HER NAME

DURING OUR INTERVIEW WILLIAM PROSTRATED ON HIS KNEES AND FACE TO THE GROUND
WHEREAS THE POSITION OF WILLIAM STILL IN THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE CONNECTED WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD AS ITS CORRESPONDING SECRETARY AND CHAIRMAN OF ITS ACTIVE SUB-COMMITTEE GAVE HIM PECULIAR FACILITIES FOR COLLECTING INTERESTING FACTS PERTAINING TO THIS BRANCH OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY SERVICE
BESIDES I FELT THAT WE WERE IN MORE DANGER HERE THAN WE HAD BEEN AT ANY OTHER PLACE
OR AN ELEGANT AND ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG LADY LIKE MISS THOMPSON DAUGHTER OF THE HON
IN NEW ORLEANS I HAVE SEEN WOMEN STRETCHED OUT JUST AS NAKED AS MY HAND ON BOXES AND GIVEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LASHES FOUR MEN HOLDING THEM

IN FEATURES HE IS WELL MADE DARK CHESTNUT COLOR AND INTELLIGENT POSSESSING AN ARDENT THIRST FOR LIBERTY
HER HEART WOULD HAVE FAILED HER
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WILL NEVER ADMIT FOR I THINK IT WOULD BE CONFOUNDING GREAT MORAL DISTINCTIONS THAT THE MISERIES WHICH ARISE BY WAY OF NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OUT OF THE POVERTY AND THE VICES OF MANKIND ARE TO BE COMPARED WITH THOSE MISERIES WHICH ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF POSITIVE LAW AND OF A POSITIVE INSTITUTION GIVING TO MAN PROPERTY IN MAN
SHE URGED THE CULTIVATION OF THE HOME LIFE THE SANCTITY OF THE MARRIAGE STATE A HAPPY CONTRAST TO HER STRONG-MINDED FREE-LOVE WHITE SISTERS OF THE NORTH AND THE DUTIES OF MOTHERS TO THEIR DAUGHTERS

HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE AND IN STATURE ONLY MEDIUM WITH POOR HEALTH
I HARDLY EXPECTED IT IN PHILADELPHIA BUT I THOUGHT I SHOULD GET FREE IN NEW YORK
BETWEEN THE WIDOW AND THE SON-IN-LAW IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS AGGRESSIVE STEPS EXISTED MUCH HOSTILITY WHICH STRONGLY INDICATED THE APPROACH OF A LAW-SUIT
AS I LISTENED TO HER THERE SWEPT OVER ME IN A CHILL WAVE OF HORROR THE REALIZATION THAT THIS NOBLE WOMAN HAD SHE NOT BEEN RESCUED FROM HER MOTHER'S CONDITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOLD ON THE AUCTION-BLOCK TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER--HER INTELLECT FANCY ELOQUENCE THE FLASHING WIT THAT MIGHT MAKE THE DELIGHT OF A PARISIAN SALOON AND HER PURE CHRISTIAN CHARACTER ALL THROWN IN--THE RECOLLECTION THAT WOMEN LIKE HER COULD BE DRAGGED OUT OF PUBLIC CONVEYANCES IN OUR OWN CITY OR FROWNED OUT OF FASHIONABLE CHURCHES BY ANGLO-SAXON SAINTS THE END

DEAR BRO
DEAR BRO
NO ONE WILL REPEAT THEM MORE TRUTHFULLY AND NO STORIES CAN BE MORE FRAUGHT WITH INTEREST THAN THEIRS
HE MADE A COMMON PRACTICE OF FLOGGING FEMALES WHEN STRIPPED NAKED
LANGHORN HENRY ALIAS WM
SO FAR THIS PLAN LOOKED VERY TEMPTING
THE CHEAT THAT HAD BEEN PRACTISED WAS NOT DISCOVERED BY THE FAMILY UNTIL NEXT EVENING
CONCKLIN WAS ROWING HEROICALLY WHEN LOUD VOICES FROM THE SHORE HAILED HIM BUT HE WAS UTTERLY DEAF TO THE SOUND
A FEW DAYS AGO A SHAMEFUL OUTRAGE OCCURRED AT THIS PLACE--SOME MEN HAD BEEN OUT FOX HUNTING AND CAME TO THE DOOR OF A COLORED WOMAN AND DEMANDED ENTRANCE MAKING OUT THEY WANTED FIRE
LEWIS ELIZA 350
PARTICULARLY WAS THIS THE CASE WITH REGARD TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED INDIVIDUALS
THE SECRETS OF MASONRY ARE NOT MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN WERE THE WAYS OF THESE OFFICIALS WHO CLOTHED FED AND COMFORTED THE FUGITIVE WHILE THEY APPARENTLY NEVER KNEW HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS
INDEED THEY WERE CONVINCED THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST OF SUFFERERS AND THE CHIEF OF HEROES
HE WAS MORE THAN EVER RESOLVED TO GET AN EDUCATION AND GO BACK TO VIRGINIA TO HELP TEACH HIS BRETHREN WHO HAD BEEN SO LONG DENIED THE PRIVILEGE
MILLER'S ARRIVED AT THE SAME PLACE SOON AFTER INTENDING TO GO TO PHILADELPHIA
THE PROSPECT BEFORE THE POOR SLAVE IS INDEED DARK DARK
WE THAT BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH SETH CONCKLIN AND HIS HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISES HERE AT CINCINNATI WHO WERE VERY FEW HAVE FELT INTENSE AND INEXPRESSIBLE ANXIETY ABOUT THEM
ON HER ARRIVAL THERE THE REV
SMITH WHO WAS INCARCERATED OVER SEVEN YEARS IN THE RICHMOND PENITENTIARY FOR DOING AN ACT THAT WAS HONORABLE TO HIS FEELINGS AND HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE AND HUMANITY THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT WE WELCOME HIM TO THIS CITY AS A MARTYR TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM
THIS WAS THE EMPHATIC TESTIMONY OF MARTHA
IT READS THUS RASCALITY SOMEWHERE.--WE CALLED ATTENTION YESTERDAY TO THE ADVERTISEMENT OF TWO NEGROES BELONGING TO MRS LOUISA WHITE BY TOLER COOK AND IN THE CALL WE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THEY WERE STILL LURKING ABOUT THE CITY PREPARATORY TO GOING OFF
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINGS THEY HAD REASON TO FEEL THAT NEITHER OF THESE OFFICIALS SYMPATHIZED IN THE LEAST WITH WHEELER OR SLAVERY
THE OTHER FIVE COLORED MEN WERE TAKEN UP IN ORDER
TWO WERE SISTERS AND HE LIVED WITH THEM ALL AS HIS WIVES
SHE WAS THE WIFE OF A FREE MAN BUT THE SLAVE OF L
EVERYBODY KNOWS ME TO BE A MILLER
SHE EXPIRED ON TUESDAY MORNING NOVEMBER 21ST 1854 OF GOUT OF THE HEART AFTER A SHORT BUT PAINFUL ILLNESS IN THE EIGHTIETH YEAR OF HER AGE
IN APPEARANCE JANE IS TALL AND WELL FORMED HIGH AND LARGE FOREHEAD OF GENTEEL MANNERS CHESTNUT COLOR AND SEEMS TO POSSESS NATURALLY UNCOMMON GOOD SENSE THOUGH OF COURSE SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO READ
DO WE NOT BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES LEADS THE CAUSE OF HUMAN FREEDOM
GET UP MY CHILD SPAKE ONE OF THE WOMEN
AND YET THAT WAS AN EVENT THAT WAS FRAUGHT WITH MORE JOY TO THE WORLD THAN ANY THAT HAS OCCURRED OR COULD OCCUR
BUT HE TOOK SICK AND DIED
THE COMBINATION MUST BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE LAW ITSELF
THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT IS A PROOF OF THIS
SHE IS NOT DARKER NOW BUT HEAVIER SET EVERY WAY
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT MY OFFICE AND OTHER BUILDINGS BURNED DOWN DURING THE RECENT FIRE
THERE ARE SEVERAL OF MY ACQUAINTANCES HERE WHO HAVE LIVED IN THAT COUNTY AND POSSIBLY THROUGH MY ASSISTANCE YOUR COMMISSIONS MIGHT BE EXECUTED
HE FLED FROM A FARMER THE LATE WILLIAM JACKSON WHO OWNED IT WAS SAID SIXTEEN HEAD HE HAD RECENTLY DIED LEAVING ALL HIS SLAVES IN BONDAGE
HER RENDERING OF THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AT THIS TIME WAS IRRESISTIBLY LUDICROUS AS WAS THAT OF HIS WHOLE BEARING WHILE SEARCHING FOR HER
BUT I AM ONLY A MAN ONLY ONE OF THE HUMAN RACE
NO MATTER WHEN IT WAS ON HOLIDAY OR WORKING-DAY OR SABBATH
BUFFALO AUG
COMING UP TO HIM I CRIED OUT LORD MASTER HAVE YOU SOLD ME
THAT TO PROCURE A LITTLE FINER MUSLIN FOR MY LIMBS NO CRUSHED AND BROKEN HEART WENT OUT IN SIGHS AND THAT FROM THE FIELD WHERE IT WAS RAISED WENT UP NO WILD AND STARTLING CRY UNTO THE THRONE OF GOD TO WITNESS THERE IN LANGUAGE DEEP AND STRONG THAT IN DEMANDING THAT COTTON I WAS NERVING OPPRESSION'S HAND FOR DEEDS OF GUILT AND CRIME
GIVE MY LOVE TO MRS STILL ACCEPT THE SAME YOURSELF
HARRY WISE
FROM SUCH INDICATIONS HENRY WAS FULLY PERSUADED THAT HIS TIME WAS WELL NIGH AT HAND AND GREAT WAS HIS ANXIETY AS HE MEDITATED OVER THE AUCTION-BLOCK
THEY WERE INDEBTED TO THE BALTIMORE SUN FOR THE ADVERTISEMENT INFORMATION
HE WAS NOT TO DEIGN TO NOTICE ANYBODY
HE WAS A MAN OF UNUSUAL PERSONAL BRAVERY AND OF POWERFUL PHYSIQUE AND DID NOT PRESENT AN ENCOURAGING OBJECT FOR THE BULLYING INTIMIDATION BY WHICH THE PRO-SLAVERY MEN OF THAT DAY GENERALLY OVERAWED THEIR OPPONENTS
EIGHT HUNDRED MILES TO CINCINNATI
WILL YOU TELL ME HOW MANY YOU HAVE SENT OVER TO CANADA
FOR THEN THEY TOOK THEIR STAND ON OTHER AND DIFFERENT AND WHAT THEY IN THEIR BLINDNESS THOUGHT HIGHER GROUNDS AND THEY SAID EVIL
HE HAD A REMARKABLY LARGE HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS AND WAS THE PICTURE OF DETERMINATION AND APPARENTLY WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF A SUBJECT THAT MIGHT BE DESIRABLE IN THE BRITISH POSSESSIONS IN THE FOREST OR ON THE FARM
THE SERVICES OF THE BOYS WERE ACCEPTED AND THIS GAVE OFFENCE TO THE MASTER
RENEWED LAUGHTER WHERE IS SOUTHERN SLAVERY NOW
AFTER AWHILE MY MASTER DIED
DURING HIS RESIDENCE WITH WILLIAM WRIGHT NOTHING COULD EXCEED HIS KINDNESS OR GRATITUDE TO THE WHOLE FAMILY
ON THE OTHER HAND ANY REVELATION OF THE MATTER MIGHT PROVE TOO EXCITING FOR THE POOR SOUL;--HER NAME WAS ESTHER
ALSO WE SPOKE OF A MR HOUGHMAN A GENTLEMAN WE HAPPENED TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HAVING SEEN HIM IN VIRGINIA
PENNYPACKER U.G.R.R
THE COMMITTEE ENCOURAGED THEM IN THIS AND AIDED THEM FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE.--MR ROBERT DADE'S ADVERTISEMENT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF AS FOLLOWS
WHEN YOU SEE HIM
SHE DID NOT DO THE WORK OF A WOMAN IN 1826
SO HE WAS CAUTIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE THE HINT IN TIME HENRY LEFT IN COMPANY WITH NINE OTHERS
CORNELIUS FULLER AND HIS WIFE HARRIET ESCAPED TOGETHER FROM KENT COUNTY MARYLAND
DR THOMAS WARREN WHO FOLLOWED FARMING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EATONTOWN WAS THE OWNER OF WILLIAM
AS SLAVES THEY ALLEGED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO VERY BRUTAL TREATMENT FROM THEIR PROFANE AND ILL-NATURED OWNERS
ROBERTA TAYLOR
$300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM KALORAMA NEAR WASHINGTON CITY D.C ON SATURDAY NIGHT THE 22D OF AUGUST 1857 NEGRO MAN GEORGE JOHNSON AGED ABOUT 25 YEARS
BUT NOT KEEP TOO MUCH IN THE QUIET SHALL HAVE TO WORK OUR DELIVERANCE FROM BONDAGE
MY DEAR FRIEND:--IT IS SAID THAT TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION
HE WAS DELAYED IN NORFOLK FOUR WEEKS
THE CHRONOTYPE SAYS THE DAMAGES BEING LAID AT $10,000
I WENT AWAY OF MY OWN FREE WILL
FOR A TIME THEY CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS WITH ENTERPRISE AND COMMENDABLE CREDIT BUT ONE OF THE PARTNERS DISGUSTED WITH THE PREJUDICES OF THE CITY PASSENGER RAILWAY CARS FELT THAT HE COULD NO LONGER LIVE HERE
THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING LETTERS PENNED BY THE HAND OF CONCKLIN CONVEY MINUTELY HIS LAST STRUGGLES AND CHARACTERISTICALLY REPRESENT THE SINGLENESS OF HEART WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO SACRIFICE HIS LIFE FOR THE SLAVE EASTPORT MISS FEB
EXTRACT BELIEVES IN PRAYING FOR THE SLAVE--BUT THINKS FIRE AND SWORD WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH SLAVE-HOLDERS
THE OWNER OF THE LOST PROPERTY HAD THE COSTS TO PAY OF COURSE BUT WHETHER HE WAS MADE A WISER OR BETTER MAN BY THE OPERATION WAS NEVER ASCERTAINED
YOU ARE FAR KINDER TO ME THAN I DESERVE
HE AT ONCE DECIDED THAT THEY MUST IMMEDIATELY BE SEPARATED FROM THE HORSES AND CARRIAGES AND GOT OUT OF WILMINGTON AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
JAMES STEWART ALIAS WM
POOR PEOPLE
BUT MRS L
WAS FOR HIS BENEFACTOR'S FAMILY AND C
INDEED IT ALWAYS AFFORDED THE COMMITTEE ESPECIAL SATISFACTION TO SEE CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE AND FEMALES ESCAPING FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE
THAT SLAVERY STUNTS THE BODY AS WELL AS MIND
I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEIR ELEVATION AS A NATION TO PLACE THEM IN THE PROPER POSITION TO STAND WHERE THEY OUGHT TO STAND
PAY THEIR EXPENSES AND GIVE THEM A HALF DOLLAR OVER FUGITIVE SLAVES.--WE NEXT TURN TO THE COMMUNICATION OF ANOTHER WARM FRIEND TO THE FUGITIVES IN THE STATE OF THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM A RECENT LETTER OF HIS
THE MISERABLE COWARDS BROKE OPEN THE DOOR AND SHAMEFULLY BEAT HER
EPHRAIM LEFT HIS MOTHER AND SIX BROTHERS AND SISTERS
IN THEIR POWER IMMEDIATELY THE TIME OF TROUBLE BEGAN WITH PASCAL AND SO CONTINUED UNTIL HE COULD NO LONGER ENDURE IT
AND YET EXCEPT THE BEDS AND BED CLOTHING I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR ALL THEIR HOUSE FURNITURE
LLOYD GARRISON TOOK THE GROUND OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION AND URGED THE DUTY OF UNCONDITIONAL LIBERTY WITHOUT EXPATRIATION MRS MOTT TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE MOVEMENT
I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM A FEW DAYS AGO
INDEED HE DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT HIS HAZARDOUS OPERATIONS MIGHT ANY DAY RESULT IN THE SACRIFICE OF HIS LIFE
DR JAMES MUSE IS THOUGHT BY THE SERVANTS TO BE THE WORST MAN IN MARYLAND INFLICTING WHIPPING AND ALL MANNER OF CRUELTIES UPON THE SERVANTS WHILE SAM GAVE REASONS FOR THIS SWEEPING CHARGE WHICH LEFT NO ROOM FOR DOUBT ON THE PART OF THE COMMITTEE OF HIS SINCERITY AND GOOD JUDGMENT IT WAS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY TO MAKE A NOTE OF MORE OF THE DOCTOR'S CHARACTER THAN SEEMED ACTUALLY NEEDED IN ORDER TO SHOW WHY SAM HAD TAKEN PASSAGE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
WAS LAST SEEN IN THIS CITY ON TUESDAY LAST HAD A PASS TO HANOVER COUNTY AND SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING HIS WAY TOWARDS YORK RIVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING ON BOARD SOME COASTING VESSEL
I HAVE A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT THE COLORED PEOPLE AND THE WOMEN ARE TO HAVE A DAY OF PROSPERITY AND TRIUMPH OVER THEIR OPPRESSORS
IT WAS THE SYSTEM WHICH WAS DAILY GRINDING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM THAT CAUSED HIM TO SUFFER AND LIKEWISE ESCAPE
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE SONS WERE DOOMED TO THE AUCTION BLOCK AND THE FAR SOUTH WHERE THE WRITER HAS NEVER EXACTLY LEARNED
QUALES
ARRIVAL FROM QUEEN ANN COUNTY 1858
HENRY BOX BROWN ARRIVED BY ADAMS EXPRESS
BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE DESIRED HAVEN HE WAS DISCOVERED AND REMANDED TO SLAVERY
SHE ESCAPED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
MILLER IN WEST NOTTINGHAM WHERE RACHEL WAS LIVING AND SEIZED HER GAGGED HER AND PLACED HER IN A CARRIAGE AND DROVE OFF
I HOPE THIS WILL BE NO ADMIRATION TO YOU FOR NO HONEST HEARTED PERSON EVER SAW YOU THAT WOULD NOT DESIRE TO BE WHERE YOU ARE NO FLATTERY BUT CANDIDLY SPEAKING YOU ARE WORTHY ALL THE PRAISE OF ANY PERSON WHO HAS EVER BEEN WITH YOU I AM NOW LIKE A DESERTED CHRISTIAN BUT YET I HAVE ASKED SO MUCH AND ALL HAS BEEN DONE YET I MUST ASK AGAIN MY LOVE TO MRS STILL
HE GREW VERY UNHAPPY BUT COULD SEE NO REMEDY EXCEPT IN FLIGHT
HARPER DELIVERED A POEM UPON MOSES IN WILBRAHAM TO A LARGE AND DELIGHTED AUDIENCE
THE HUSBAND UTTERLY POWERLESS TO OFFER HER THE LEAST SYMPATHY IN WORD OR DEED LEFT THIS DARK HABITATION OF CRUELTY AS ABOVE REFERRED TO WITH NO HOPE OF EVER SEEING WIFE OR CHILD AGAIN IN THIS WORLD
C.H
OF THE WRONGS OF THE SYSTEM
$1,300 WALKED OFF IN THE PERSON OF GEORGE
THIS PURPOSE WAS MADE KNOWN TO A CAPTAIN WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF BRINGING PASSENGERS FROM THE SOUTH TO PHILADELPHIA
ESTEEMED FRIENDS--MCKIM AND STILL:--I PURPOSE SENDING TO-MORROW MORNING BY THE STEAMBOAT A WOMAN AND CHILD WHOSE HUSBAND I THINK WENT SOME NINE MONTHS PREVIOUS TO NEW BEDFORD
HITCHENS.--THIS INDIVIDUAL TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FROM MILFORD DEL WHERE HE WAS OWNED BY WM
WE HAVE WITHIN THE PAST 2 MOS
IF HE HAD BEEN A FEW SHADES DARKER AND ONLY ABOUT HALF AS INTELLIGENT AS HE WAS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH AT LEAST $500 MORE
THE ENTIRE JOURNEY WAS EXTREMELY DISCOURAGING AND MANY STEPS HAD TO BE TAKEN IN VAIN HUNGRY AND WEARY
AFTER TRAVELING UPWARDS OF TWO DAYS AND OVER SIXTY MILES WE FOUND OURSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY IN TERRYTOWN MD
IT WAS THE OLD SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATED THE RUSSIANS AT MOSCOW AND THE BLACKS OF HAYTI
HE GAVE ABUNDANT PROOF OF TRUE MATRIMONIAL DEVOTION NOTWITHSTANDING THE SECRECY OF HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR FLIGHT
SAM ARCHER LEWIS PECK DAVID EDWARDS EDWARD CASTING JOE HENRY GEORGE AND ALBERT WHITE JOSEPH C
HE HAS BEEN IN THE SWAMPS OF CAROLINA FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS PAST
SHE WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE MEDIUM SIZE QUITE DARK COLOR AND OF PLEASANT COUNTENANCE
I ESCAPED FROM A MAN BY THE NAME OF JESSE W
IN THE BELIEF THAT THEIR OWNER HAD ABOUT GIVEN THEM UP THEY RESOLVED TO TAKE THE NORTH STAR FOR A PILOT AND TRY IN THIS WAY TO REACH FREE LAND
WE AT ONCE WENT TO THE WOODS AND HID
THIS IS ALL THAT THE RECORDS CONTAIN OF THEM
SCARCELY LESS VIVID IS THE IMPRESSION AFTER A LAPSE OF SIXTEEN YEARS THAN WHEN THIS ELOQUENT SPEECH WAS MADE
HER MASTER DEPARTED TO HIS LONG HOME NOT A GREAT WHILE BEFORE SHE LEFT
THE WAR WAS THEN RAGING FIERCELY AND AS MILES THEN FELT HE WAS ALMOST PREPARED TO SAY HE DIDN'T CARE WHICH BEAT AS THE WOMAN SAID WHEN SHE SAW HER HUSBAND AND THE BEAR WRESTLING
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE GOING ON HAPPILY AND THEY HAD NO APPARENT REASON TO SUSPECT ANY TROUBLES OTHER THAN SUCH AS MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A STATE OF POVERTY AND TOIL
IN LOOKING BACK INTO THE PIT FROM WHENCE HE HAD BEEN DELIVERED HE COULD TELL A VERY INTERESTING STORY OF WHAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED FROM WHICH IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN AN IDLE OBSERVER OF WHAT HAD PASSED RELATIVE TO THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION
HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PUT IN A PLEA FOR JUSTICE IN MARYLAND
ALSO TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER
E.M
WHEN HE BECAME SOBER HE WOULD EXPRESS REGRET AT HAVING TREATED HER SO CRUELLY
YOURS TRULY NAT AMBIE
WHY DID YOU NOT SEND THEM MORE THINGS
ONE DAY A SHORT WHILE BEFORE PETE TOOK OUT AN OX BROKE INTO THE TRUCK PATCH AND HELPED HIMSELF TO CHOICE DELICACIES TO THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS CAPACIOUS STOMACH MAKING SAD HAVOC WITH THE VEGETABLES GENERALLY
AS HE COULD SEE NO PROSPECT OF FREEDOM THROUGH HER AGENCY WHEN FRANK APPROACHED HIM WITH A GOOD REPORT FROM CANADA AND HIS FRIENDS THERE HE COULD SCARCELY WAIT TO LISTEN TO THE GLORIOUS NEWS
THE FROST HAD MADE SAD HAVOC WITH HIS FEET AND LEGS SO MUCH SO THAT ALL SENSE OF FEELING HAD DEPARTED THEREFROM
TWO OF MY BROTHERS OWN SMALL PLACES ALSO BUT THEY HAVE YOUNG FAMILIES AND CONSEQUENTLY CONSUME NEARLY AS MUCH AS THEY MAKE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ADDING SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR PLACES
IN 1833 WHEN ON HIS WAY TO THE WEST IN A CARRIAGE WITH HIS FRIEND THOMAS PEART ALSO A MOST FAITHFUL FRIEND OF THE COLORED MAN AND INTERESTED IN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AFFAIRS HE FOUND A FUGITIVE SLAVE A WOMAN IN ADAMS COUNTY WHO WAS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER
PETER MATHEWS ALIAS SAMUEL SPARROWS
FOR TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS ALL THE CAPITAL THEY HAD
HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THIS END A MORE ENCOURAGING AND PLEASANT PHASE OF THE TRANSACTION MAY NOW BE INTRODUCED
THE THREATS OF MY MASTER CAUSED ME TO REFLECT ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH
SUSAN HAD BEEN A GREAT SUFFERER AND SO HAD HER MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN A LONG TIME ANXIOUSLY LOOKING AND PRAYING FOR HER COMING AS SHE HAD LEFT HER IN CHARGE OF FRIENDS WHO WERE TO TAKE CARE OF HER UNTIL THE WAY MIGHT OPEN FOR HER SAFE DELIVERY TO HER MOTHER
IF I CAN LEARN ANY MORE FACTS OF IMPORTANCE I MAY WRITE YOU
TWO MONTHS AND A HALF BEFORE SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING OFF CLARISSA HAD MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT BUT FAILED
RETURNING TO PENNSYLVANIA TO PRACTICE HIS PROFESSION HIS HOME BECAME ONE OF THE HAVENS WHERE THE HUNTED FUGITIVE FROM SLAVERY FOUND FOOD SHELTER AND REST
BY JOHN HUNN ENGINEER OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
I SEND THIS THROUGH HIS MEDIUM BUT FEAR TO ADD MORE LEST I SHOULD MAKE HIS LETTER TOO HEAVY
CORNELIUS IT WAS SAID BELONGED TO THE DIDEN ESTATE
CARR DAN'L 168
SHEPHARD PERRY 319
YOUR ADMIRABLE AND INTERESTING SKETCH OF THE CAREER OF THE LATE THOMAS GARRETT CONTAINS ONE OR TWO STATEMENTS WHICH ACCORDING TO MY RECOLLECTION OF THE FACTS ARE NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE AND ARE PERHAPS OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO BE CORRECTED
STILL IN THE DARKNESS THEY IMAGINED THEY HEARD WATCHMEN COMING
HANDING HIS BILL OF LADING TO THE PROPER OFFICER OF THE BOAT HE ASKED IF HE COULD GET THE FREIGHT THAT IT CALLED FOR
I WAS AT THE FUNERAL AND HELPED TO MAKE HIS COFFIN
OH GOD WHAT SHALL I DO OR WHAT CAN I DO FOR HIM
SO IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE SO FAR TO CARRY HIM FATHER AND MOTHER EACH BRIDLED A HORSE AND TOOK OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRST UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STATION
HE WAS AMONG THE MANLIEST OF MEN AND THE GENTLEST OF SPIRITS
OUR REASON FOR SENDING BY THE READING ROAD WAS TO GAIN TIME
MARY FLED FROM PETERSBURG AND THE ROBINSONS FROM RICHMOND
RYBOLD AND WAS ONLY NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE
I BORROWED A PASS FROM A MAN ABOUT MY SIZE AND COMPLEXION
AND WITHAL THAT HE HAD ABUSED HIM FOR YEARS AND RECENTLY HAD THREATENED TO SELL HIM
HIS WOUNDS ARE VERY SEVERE AND IT IS FEARED MORTAL
MISTRESS WAS VERY BAD
NOW IT IS VERY CERTAIN THAT HE DID NOT SEEK TO KNOW FROM THOSE IN THE SECRET WHERE JANE JOHNSON AND HER BOYS WERE TAKEN AFTER THEY LEFT THE WHARF OR AS TO WHAT DISPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE OF THEM IN ANY WAY
THIS PARTY UNITED TO THROW OFF THE YOKE IN HAVERFORD COUNTY MD
THE EXPRESSION LEVYING WAR SO REGARDED EMBRACES NOT MERELY THE ACT OF FORMAL OR DECLARED WAR BUT ANY COMBINATION FORCIBLY TO PREVENT OR OPPOSE THE EXECUTION OR ENFORCEMENT OF A PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION OR OF A PUBLIC STATUTE IF ACCOMPANIED OR FOLLOWED BY AN ACT OF FORCIBLE OPPOSITION IN PURSUANCE OF SUCH COMBINATION
BEING ACTIVELY ASSOCIATED IN THE EFFORTS FOR THE SLAVE'S REDEMPTION SHE SAYS I HAVE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THIS COUNTRY HOLDING MEETINGS IN SOME OF THE SLAVE STATES HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF MOBS AND VIOLENCE AND HAVE SHARED ABUNDANTLY IN THE ODIUM ATTACHED TO THE NAME OF AN UNCOMPROMISING MODERN ABOLITIONIST AS WELL AS PARTAKEN RICHLY OF THE SWEET RETURN OF PEACE ATTENDANT ON THOSE WHO WOULD UNDO THE HEAVY BURDENS AND LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE AND BREAK EVERY YOKE IN 1840 SHE ATTENDED THE WORLD'S ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION IN LONDON
SIMILAR CASES OF THRILLING INTEREST SEEMED ALMOST INCREDIBLE AND THE COMMITTEE WERE CONSTRAINED TO DOUBT THE STORY ALTOGETHER UNTIL OTHER TESTIMONY COULD BE OBTAINED TO VERIFY THE STATEMENT
AT LAST HE WAS ONLY APPRISED OF HIS OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY HIS WISHES INTO PRACTICE A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THE HOUR FOR THE STARTING OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TRAIN
I GOT TO NEW YORK THE SAME DAY THAT I LEFT PHILADELPHIA BUT I HAD TO STAY THERE UNTEL MONDAY EVENING
WHAT THEY CALL A RED MULATTO THE RED WAS NEW TO US
FOR A LONG TIME ALTHOUGH A SLAVE HIMSELF HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DEXTEROUS MANAGERS IN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENCY IN NORFOLK
ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK VA 1857
DURING HIS LATTER YEARS HE WAS AIDED IN THE GOOD WORK BY HIS CHILDREN WHO NEVER HESITATED TO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN PLEASURE IN ORDER TO HELP AWAY FUGITIVES
BECAUSE TIMES WERE HARD AND I COULD NOT COME UP WITH MY WAGES AS I WAS REQUIRED TO DO SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY AND DO BETTER AT THIS JUNCTURE ABRAM EXPLAINED SUBSTANTIALLY IN WHAT SENSE TIMES WERE HARD C
HE NEVER FAILED THE FUGITIVE IN THE HOUR OF NEED
IF IT MEANS INCESSANT TOIL QUIETLY PERFORMED VAST SUMS COLLECTED AND DISBURSED TIME SACRIFICED STRENGTH SPENT
THE WOE OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS SIGHED THROUGH HER TONES
I AM STILL IN THE LECTURING FIELD THOUGH NOT VERY STRONG PHYSICALLY
LIGHTFOOT IS WELL AND REMEMBERS YOU AND FAMILY
I ANSWERED YES
AND THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE WERE ESPECIALLY DEVOTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF PRISONS AND PRISONERS
AND IF YOU COULD SEE OUR MAINE LADIES,--SOME OF THEM AMONG THE NOBLEST TYPES OF WOMANHOOD YOU HAVE EVER SEEN
THE GRASS IS PUTTING UP AND BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE SPRING
I WOULD GO
I WAS SURPRISED SAID HE TO SEE THE EXPERTNESS WITH WHICH ALL FLEW UP THE HILL ONE WOMAN QUITE LUSTY UNFIT TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE ON RUNNING UP THE HILL FELL
IT WAS SATURATED WITH SEA-WATER AND DISSOLVED TO A PULP
LEMUEL WAS THIRTY-FIVE AND MIGHT BE CALLED A JET-BLACK
YOU NEVER CAN KNOW HOW ANXIOUS I AM TO HEAR FROM THEM
IN THIS DARK HOUR THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE COULD DO BUT LITTLE MORE THAN SYMPATHIZE WITH THIS HEART-STRICKEN SON AND GREY-HEADED FATHER
WITH NOTHING TO APPEASE THE GNAWINGS OF HUNGER BUT PARCHED CORN AND A FEW DRY CRACKERS WET AND COLD WITH SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN SICK SOME OF THEIR FEET BARE AND WORN AND ONE OF THE MOTHERS WITH AN INFANT IN HER ARMS INCAPABLE OF PARTAKING OF THE DIET,--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE ORDEAL THEY WERE PASSING
CHARLES BIRD GEORGE DORSEY ANGELINE BROWN ALBERT BROWN CHARLES BROWN AND JANE SCOTT
SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOW TAKE IT UPON YOURSELF TO INFORM ME SOMETHING OF THAT LETTER I LEFT AT YOUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT WHEN I LEFT THERE AND WRITE ME WORD HOW YOU ARE AND HOW IS YOUR WIFE
SHADD THE THEN EDITRESS OF THE PROVINCIAL FREEMAN SAID ACCOUNT HAS BEEN CAREFULLY PRESERVED AND IS HERE ANNEXED AS IT APPEARED IN THE COLUMNS OF THE ABOVE NAMED PAPER
BEESLY DICK 473
MY MIND HAS BEEN MUCH TAKEN UP IN SO DOING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS PAST
AFTER REACHING NEW BEDFORD CLARISSA MANIFESTED HER GRATITUDE IN WRITING TO HER FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA REPEATEDLY AND EVINCED A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN THE U.G.R.R
ARRIVAL FROM THE DAILY DISPATCH OFFICE
SECRETED IN THE WOODS--ESCAPES IN A STEAMER
I STAYED IN THE HOLLOW OF A BIG POPLAR TREE FOR SEVEN MONTHS
AND ALTHOUGH DERRICKSON WAS SAID TO BE A MILD MASTER PETER DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO WORKING FOR HIM FOR NOTHING
WHEN IN NOVEMBER 1863 THE PORT ROYAL RELIEF COMMITTEE WAS ENLARGED INTO THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEDMAN'S RELIEF ASSOCIATION MR MCKIM WAS MADE ITS CORRESPONDING SECRETARY
153 BROADWAY BALTIMORE
I ARRIVED IN NEW BEDFORD THURSDAY MORNING SAFELY AND WHAT LITTLE I HAVE SEEN OF THE CITY I LIKE IT VERY MUCH MY FRIENDS WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE ME
HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS WELL ABLE TO DO A FULL DAY'S WORK AT THIS OCCUPATION
BY MISS GRACE A
SLAVE-HOLDER HAVE YOU SERIOUSLY THOUGHT UPON THE CONDITION YOURSELVES FAMILY AND SLAVES
SHE FLED FROM NATHANIEL HERNE AN ALDERMAN
AND IN ALL THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION THEY MANIFESTED A MARKED WILLINGNESS TO ENCOUNTER PERILS EITHER BY LAND OR WATER BY DAY OR BY NIGHT TO OBTAIN THEIR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS
THE NEW YORK OBSERVER THUS ANNOUNCES HIS DEATH
THE MEMORIES OF THE CHOICE SPIRITS HE USED TO MEET IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY GATHERINGS
GIVE MY BEST RESPECT TO MR B
STANLEY DANIEL 102
I WISH YOU WOULD SEE MR ORMSTED AND ASK HIM IF HE HAS NOT SOME THINGS FOR MR ANTHONY LONEY AND IF HE HAS PLEASE SEND THEM ON WITH MY THINGS AS WE ARE BOTH LIVING TOGETHER AT THIS TIME
IT DEALS WITH THE STORY OF THE HEBREW MOSES FROM HIS FINDING IN THE WICKER BASKET ON THE NILE TO HIS DEATH ON MOUNT NEBO AND HIS BURIAL IN AN UNKNOWN GRAVE
THEY WERE CHEERED WITH CLOTHING FOOD AND MATERIAL AID AND SPED ON TO CANADA
AN END LIKE AUTUMN'S DAY DECLINING ON HUMAN HEARTS AS ON THE SKY WITH HOLIER TENDERER BEAUTY SHINING
BUT HUMAN CAUTION SHREWDNESS PURPOSE ARE LENT TO ANIMAL INSTINCT
IT WILL BE THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR STORY FOR GENERATIONS

SMALLWOOD HENRY 504
AND HE HAS EVER SINCE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF KEROSENE OIL
FULL $1,000 OF THIS AMOUNT IN THE OPINION OF SAM WAS THE RESULT OF HIS OWN FETTERED HANDS
SEARCHING THE COUNTRY OPPOSITE PADUCAH I FIND THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY FIFTY MILES ROUND IS INHABITED ONLY BY CHRISTIAN WOLVES
SHE REPORTED HERSELF FROM BALTIMORE WHERE SHE HAD BEEN OWNED BY LAWYER MAGILL
STRONG HOPES WERE ENTERTAINED THAT BEFORE THE OLD MAN'S DEATH HE WOULD MAKE PROVISION IN HIS WILL FOR THE FREEDOM OF ALL THE OTHER SLAVES
ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK WARRANTS FOR THE ARREST OF WILLIAM AND ELLEN WERE ISSUED BY JUDGE LEVI WOODBURY BUT NO OFFICER HAS YET BEEN FOUND READY OR BOLD ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM
HIPKINS WM
LOOKING CONFUSED HE LEFT THE SOAP HOUSE AND WENT TO HIS OFFICE TO AWAIT THE DISPERSION OF THE CROWD
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION OF THE SOUTH HE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A REBEL AT HEART CONSEQUENTLY HE RESOLVED TO TAKE A TRIP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TO CANADA
THEREFORE OUR NOTICE OF THIS ARRIVAL WILL CHIEFLY RELATE TO HER
OWEN AND OTHO TAYLOR'S FLIGHT WITH HORSES ETC

HE THEREFORE CLIMBED UP A LARGE ACORN TREE AND THERE PASSED AN ENTIRE DAY IN DEEP MEDITATION
SHE BROUGHT ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS AND HE EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS
IF I HAVE HIS FAVOR WHY NEED I REGARD MAN'S DISFAVOR
AS REGARDS THE PRICE FIXED UPON BY YOU FOR THE FAMILY I MUST SAY I DO NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE TO RAISE HALF THAT AMOUNT THOUGH PETER AUTHORIZED ME TO SAY HE WOULD GIVE YOU TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED FOR THEM
AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN CANADA HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS AND CHERISHED HIS LOVED IDEA THAT THE LORD WAS VERY GOOD TO HIM
15TH 1856
15TH 1856
15TH 1856
AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF PLEASURE WAS FELT IN WELCOMING THIS PARTY OF YOUNG MEN NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE ANY BETTER THAN OTHERS OR BECAUSE THEY HAD SUFFERED MORE BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE FOUND TO POSSESS CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF SLAVE LIFE AS IT EXISTED UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CHIVALRY
NO PRIVILEGE WAS ALLOWED ME TO STUDY BOOKS
I HAVE TRIED TO BEG SOMETHING FOR THEM BUT HAVE NOT GOT MUCH
RAN AWAY AT THE SAME TIME AND IN COMPANY NEGRO MAN SAM GROSS AGED ABOUT 33 IS 5 FEET 8 OR 9 INCHES HIGH BLACK COLOR RATHER BAD TEETH
I HAVE BEEN IN ATLANTA FOR SOME TIME BUT DID NOT STAY UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE WAS ORGANIZED
THE LATTER HE CRAVED AND IN THOUGHT WAS OFTEN FAR BEYOND MASON AND DIXON'S LINE ENJOYING THAT WHICH WAS DENIED HIM IN VIRGINIA
BUT CONTENDED THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE--THAT SHE WAS ON A VISIT TO NEW YORK TO SEE HER FRIENDS--AFTERWARD WISHED TO RETURN TO HER THREE CHILDREN WHOM SHE LEFT IN VIRGINIA FROM WHOM IT WOULD BE HARD TO SEPARATE HER
AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE HAWKINS FAMILY FROM MIDDLETOWN I RETURNED HOME TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF S.D
ANDERSON HENRY ALIAS WM
HE LIVED ABOUT SIXTEEN MILES FROM ELKTON NEAR CHARLESTON MARYLAND
THE THEORY OF HIS FRIENDS WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY SNATCHED FROM THE PLATFORM OF THE CAR IN THE BALTIMORE DEPOT GAGGED STRIPPED AND LASHED DOWN BY THE ANKLES AND WRISTS AND A ROPE ACROSS HIS ABDOMEN THAT HIS NOSE HAD BEEN HELD BY SOME INSTRUMENT AND THAT HE WAS IN THIS SITUATION DRENCHED WITH ARSENIC AND PUKED AND PURGED TO DEATH AND THAT MCCREARY OR SOME ONE FOR HIM HAD HEARD WILEY REPEAT AT STEMEN'S RUN STATION THAT HE WAS NOT ON THE TRAIN CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF TAKING HIS BODY THERE AND HANGING IT TO A TREE TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT HE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THAT PLACE AND SUCH WAS THE STATEMENT PUBLISHED BY SOME OF THE MARYLAND NEWSPAPERS
ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE 1858
ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE 1858
DEAR SIR:--YOUR FAVOR CONTAINING DRAFT ON N
STILL HE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BE RECKLESS OR NEEDLESSLY TO IMPERIL HIS LIFE OR THE LIVES OF THOSE HE UNDERTOOK TO AID
THE MORE HE REFLECTED OVER HIS CONDITION THE MORE DETERMINED HE GREW TO SEEK HIS FREEDOM
WITH THIS HOPE IN HIM HE CONTRIVED TO SECURE A PRIVATE PASSAGE ON THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND AND IN THIS WAY REACHED PHILADELPHIA BUT NOT WITHOUT SUFFERING FEARFULLY THE ENTIRE JOURNEY THROUGH OWING TO THE NARROWNESS OF THE SPACE INTO WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO BE STOWED IN ORDER TO GET AWAY
IN HIS SIMPLE MANNER OF DESCRIBING THE TRIALS HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO ENDURE IT WAS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE WAS WILLING TO FORSAKE ALL AND RUN FEARFUL RISKS IN ORDER TO RID HIMSELF NOT ONLY OF THE LOAD ON HIS BACK BUT THE LOAD ON HIS HEART
HE WAS DECIDEDLY AN UNHAPPY PIECE OF PROPERTY IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND VA
INDEED THE HEALTH OF HIS WIFE WAS SO MISERABLE THAT NOTHING IN HIS OLD HOME SEEMED TO OFFER ANY INDUCEMENT IN THE WAY OF A LIVELIHOOD
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE WELL MADE WIDE AWAKE AND OF A SUPERB BLACK COMPLEXION
AGAIN HE WAS NOT IN THE SECRET OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MOVEMENT
WITHOUT DELAY I RAN WITH THE NOTE TO MR P
HE AND I OFTEN SIT TOGETHER AT NIGHT AFTER THE LABOR OF THE DAY IS OVER TALKING ABOUT OUR ABSENT FRIENDS WISHING WE COULD SEE THEM ONCE MORE
IT SEEMS THERE ARE HOPES ENTERTAINED THAT PASSMORE WILLIAMSON WILL SOON BE SET AT LIBERTY

WOOD MOSE 465
MCCAULLY OWED MOORE FOR WAGONS
TO THE LAST OF HIS DAILY JOURNEYINGS THROUGH THE CITY FOR WHICH HE GENERALLY USED THE RAIL ROAD HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW THE DRIVERS TO STOP FOR HIM TO GET ON OR OFF THE CAR FEELING AS HE USED SMILINGLY TO OBSERVE VERY JEALOUS ON THAT POINT FEW EVER PASSED HIM IN THE STREET WITHOUT ASKING WHO HE WAS
AFTER HER HARROWING STORY WAS TOLD WITH SO MUCH EARNESTNESS AND INTELLIGENCE SHE WAS ASKED AS TO THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED AT THE HAND OF MRS CHRISTIAN HER MISTRESS IN RELATION TO HER NANCY SAID MRS CHRISTIAN WAS AFRAID OF HIM MASTER
LETTER FROM THE MOTHER
NOTWITHSTANDING PLYMOUTH ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED EVEN MORE FAVORABLY THAN MOST SLAVES
AND OFF HE STARTED FOR CANADA

LANDS ACQUIRED AND GOOD FARMS MANAGED IN A MANNER TO COMPETE WITH ANY OTHER

EVERY MANLY AND GENEROUS HEART MUST BURN WITH INDIGNATION AT THE VILLAINY IT DESCRIBES AND BLEED WITH SYMPATHY FOR THE ALMOST BROKEN-HEARTED SUFFERERS
IN THE RECITAL OF MATTERS TOUCHING HIS SLAVE LIFE HE ALLUDED TO HIS MASTER SAMUEL BALL AS A VERY HARD MAN UTTERLY UNWILLING TO ALLOW HIS SERVANTS ANY CHANCE WHATEVER

THEN HE MUST BE A LITTLE LAME WITH A NICE CANE IN THE LEFT HAND
JUST ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT HE MADE HIS WAY NORTH DETERMINED NOT TO BE A SLAVE ANY LONGER HE FLED TO A SWAMP AND MADE HIS WAY TO THE MOST SECLUDED SPOT THAT HE COULD FIND,--TO PLACES THAT WERE ALMOST IMPENETRABLE SO DENSE WERE THE TREES AND UNDERGROWTH

AND FURTHERMORE TO LEARN IF THE MASTER WAS REALLY OF THE BRUTAL CHARACTER GIVEN HIM
I FELT SURE THEN I WOULD BE FREE BUT WAS VERY BADLY DISAPPOINTED
A FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS HE WENT TO HIS MASTER AND ASKED PERMISSION TO SPEND SAID HOLIDAY WITH HIS MOTHER IN CUMBERLAND COUNTY ADDING THAT HE WOULD NEED SOME SPENDING MONEY ENOUGH AT LEAST TO PAY HIS FARE ETC
TUCKER WHITE
IN THIS DILEMMA HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO ALLOW JAMES A FEW DAYS HOLIDAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINDING HIM A GOOD MASTER
A COLORED MAN CARRIED THE LITTLE ONE I LED THE OTHER BY THE HAND
NONE DARE OFFER HIM A NIGHT'S LODGING SCARCELY A CUP OF WATER LEST SUCH AN ACT MIGHT BE DISCOVERED BY THE HUNTERS WHOSE FIENDISH HEARTS WOULD HAVE FOUND PLEASURE IN METING OUT THE MOST DIRE PUNISHMENTS TO THOSE GUILTY OF THUS VIOLATING THE LAWS OF SLAVERY

HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH TWO INTERESTING PROBLEMS TO GO BACK OR TO GO FORWARD
BEING IN SIGHT OF LAND THEY WERE SPIED BY THE EVER-WATCHFUL SLAVE-HOLDER OR SOME ONE NOT FAVORABLE TO THEIR ESCAPE
HAVING CAPITAL TO THE AMOUNT OF FOUR DOLLARS ONLY HE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT DO MUCH TOWARDS EMPLOYING A CONDUCTOR BUT HE HAD A GOOD PAIR OF LEGS AND A HEART STOUT ENOUGH TO WHIP TWO OR THREE SLAVE-CATCHERS WITH THE HELP OF A PISTOL
MONDAY SEPT
THE BLACKS WARNED THEM AGAIN TO LEAVE AS THEY WOULD DIE BEFORE THEY WOULD GO INTO SLAVERY
BUT THE POOR MAN WAS DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE HAS NOT GONE BEYOND GRAMMAR AND ARITHMETIC
IT WENT ON THIS MONSTROUS ABROGATION OF EVERYTHING THAT LENDS SANCTITY TO MAN'S RELATIONS ON EARTH TILL SLAVES WERE BEASTS WITH INSTINCTS ANNIHILATED AND MASTERS DEMONS WITH INSTINCTS REVERSED
FOUR ABLE BODIED ARTICLES IN ONE ARRIVAL 1857
THAT HE MIGHT SATISFY HIMSELF ON THIS POINT HE ONE DAY VERY SLYLY APPROACHED THE HOUSE WITH GEORGE
THUS COMPARATIVELY HE WAS HAPPY AND CONTENTED LITTLE DREAMING OF TRADER OR A CHANGE OF OWNERS
EMORY ARRIVED SAFELY FROM TALBOT COUNTY
VERENEA MERCER
UP TO TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE HE HAD EXPERIENCED AND OBSERVED HOW SLAVES WERE TREATED IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THE INSTITUTION IN ANY FORM WHATEVER

THE LAST TIME WAS IN PLANTING CORN-TIME THIS YEAR
THE POLICE BEING IN STRONG FORCE HOWEVER SUCCEEDED IN MARCHING THEIR PRISONERS TO THE MAYOR'S POLICE STATION AT THE CORNER OF FIFTH AND CHESTNUT STREETS WHERE THEY WERE LOCKED UP TO AWAIT FURTHER INVESTIGATION
SUCH HUNGERING AND THIRSTING FOR LIBERTY AS WAS EVINCED BY LEAR GREEN MADE THE EFFORTS OF THE MOST ARDENT FRIENDS WHO WERE IN THE HABIT OF AIDING FUGITIVES SEEM FEEBLE IN THE EXTREME
TRUE SOMETIMES SOME OF THESE BEAUTIFUL ADVERTISEMENTS WERE OPEN TO GENTLE CRITICISM
HE WAS INTERESTED DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE IN GETTING SLAVES OFF
THE OWNER HE ALREADY HAD HE CONCLUDED BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE AND IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT HUNTING ANOTHER WOULD MEND THE MATTER MUCH
HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WERE FREE
IT WAS A PERIOD OF GREAT PROSPERITY IN OUR BOROUGH AND EVERYTHING PASSED ON FAVORABLY AND SUCCESSFULLY UNTIL THE PASSAGE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL IN 1850
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR HE LABORED UNDER A COMPLETE DELUSION--WHEN HE LEAST DREAMED OF DANGER THE SLAVE-CATCHERS WERE SCENTING HIM CLOSE
WEARY WITH BONDAGE HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD SERVED A MASTER LONG ENOUGH WITHOUT PRIVILEGES AGAINST HIS MASTER RICHARD REED HE HAD NO HARD THINGS TO SAY HOWEVER
MAY THEY ALL BE FAVORED TO GET ON SAFE
HE THEN OFFERED FRIENDLY ADVICE TALKED LIKE A QUAKER AND URGED US TO GO WITH HIM TO HIS BARN FOR PROTECTION

POSSESSED OF A WARM HEART A POWERFUL THOUGH UNCULTIVATED INTELLECT AN EXCELLENT JUDGMENT AND GREAT SWEETNESS OF DISPOSITION SHE WAS FITTED BOTH BY NATURE AND TRAINING TO ENDURE WITHOUT MURMURING THE INCONVENIENCE AND TROUBLE INCIDENT TO THE RECEPTION AND CARE OF FUGITIVES AND TO REJOICE THAT TO HER WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASSISTING THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BE FREE

SALEM 3 MO 25 55
WE STARTED EARLY MONDAY MORNING
THE WANT OF SPACE FORBIDS MORE THAN A BRIEF REFERENCE TO HER EARLY LIFE
THE LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FOR HIM WERE DATED NIAGARA FALLS CANADA WEST AND HIS FRIENDS THINK HE IS THERE--NONE OF THEM KNOW TO THE CONTRARY--IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY NEVER DO KNOW
LATELY HAD A BURN ON THE INSTEP OF HIS RIGHT FOOT BUT PERHAPS WELL ENOUGH TO WEAR A BOOT OR SHOE
IN 1789 HIS FATHER TOOK HIM TO SEE GENERAL WASHINGTON THEN PASSING THROUGH WILMINGTON
THE WITNESSES PRESENT TO BEHOLD THE RESURRECTION WERE J.M
WHILE THESE TROUBLES WERE PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JEREMIAH JULIA HIS WIFE WAS STILL MORE SERIOUSLY INVOLVED WHICH ADDED TO JEREMIAH'S PERPLEXITIES OF COURSE
TO THE CAUSE OF THE SLAVE'S FREEDOM HE GAVE WITH ALL HIS HEART HIS MONEY HIS TIME HIS TALENTS
THE TIME FOR PLANNING AND ACTING WITH ISAAC WAS HOWEVER EXCEEDINGLY SHORT
BUT DESTITUTE OF EDUCATION AND COMING AMONG STRANGERS HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE SHREDS OF SLAVERY WERE STILL TO BE SEEN UPON HIM

CHEERS I RECOLLECT WELL THE IMPRESSION WITH WHICH I READ A MOST POWERFUL AND TOUCHING PAPER WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN AND WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NUMBER OF THE WESTMINSTER REVIEW FOR DECEMBER 1838
SHE WAS CONVEYED FROM RICHMOND SECRETED ON A STEAMER UNDER THE CARE OF ONE OF THE COLORED HANDS ON THE BOAT
MR MCKIM AND OTHER NOTED ABOLITIONISTS MANAGING THE DEFENSE WERE EQUALLY ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERWHELMING THE ENEMY IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

THE YOUNG MASTER HAD EARLY ACQUIRED AN ARDENT TASTE FOR FAST HORSES GAMBLING ETC
BY HIS CONSTANT LABORS HIS HEALTH BECAME IMPAIRED
AND I RETURNED THANKS TO GOD FOR THIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE OF SO MANY HUMAN BEINGS FROM THE CHARNEL-HOUSE OF SLAVERY
SHE WAS VERY KIND AND TENDER TO ALL HER SLAVES IF I WAS SICK SAID RICHARD SHE WOULD TREAT ME THE SAME AS A MOTHER WOULD SHE WAS THE OWNER OF TWENTY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO WERE ALL HIRED OUT EXCEPT THE CHILDREN TOO YOUNG FOR HIRE
THEY PROCEEDED TO THE DEPOT IN THE USUAL MANNER AND THE SERVANT ASKED FOR TICKETS FOR HIS MASTER AND SELF
IN TIME TOO HE CAME TO BE HONORED INSTEAD OF EXECRATED FOR HIS NOBLE EFFORTS
LET HIM TRY
THE SLAVES WERE SOON SCATTERED LIKE THE WIND
HER INTEREST IN GOOD NEVER LEFT HER FOR WHEN ALMOST DYING SHE AROUSED FROM HER LETHARGY AND ASKED IF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH HE WAS A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS
YET WHEN THROUGH THE CANDIDATE ALWAYS EXPRESSED A HEARTY SENSE OF SATISFACTION AND WAS TRULY THANKFUL FOR THIS ATTENTION

FOR THEIR RECOVERY FROM A FREE STATE I WILL GIVE ONE-HALF THEIR VALUE
HE SEEMS TO BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ADJOINING LOCALITIES BUT ALTOGETHER HIS NARRATIVE IS ALMOST INCREDIBLE AND I AM THEREFORE INDUCED TO MAKE THE INQUIRY WHETHER SUCH A MAN HAS ESCAPED FROM YOUR SERVICE OR LATELY LEFT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
HAS NOT THIS SUFFERING BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE GLORY THAT GATHERED AROUND THE BRAVE OLD MAN

18TH 56
THE FACTS AND INCIDENTS RELATED ARE THEMSELVES SO FULL OF INTEREST AND DRAMATIC INTENSENESS AS TO NEED NO COLORING
THAT WAS THREE MONTHS BEFORE I RAN AWAY AND MASSA JOHN SAID A THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULDN'T BUY ONE LEG
MY DEAR STILL:--YOUR LETTER OF THE 3TH CAME TO HAND THURSDAY AND ALSO THREE COPES ALL OF WHICH I WAS GLAD TO RECEIVED THEY HAVE TAKEN MY ATTENTION ALL TOGETHER EVERY TIME I GOT THEM
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS HE WAS LIVING IN DENS AND CAVES OF THE EARTH
HIS FORMS AND TYPE WERE ACCORDINGLY DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEWPORT AND A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THEM FLUNG BY A MOB OF GENTLEMEN INTO THE OHIO RIVER
WHAT HOUSE IN DELAWARE SO HONORABLE IN HISTORY AS THAT WHERE HUNTED MEN FLED AND WERE SURE TO FIND REFUGE
YET HE WAS NOT SATISFIED
HE EXAMINED HIS FEET AND LEGS FOUND THAT THEY WERE IN GOOD ORDER AND HIS FAITH AND HOPE STRONG ENOUGH TO REMOVE A MOUNTAIN
THIS KEPT THE OLD WOUND IN ADAM'S HEART CONTINUALLY BLEEDING AND FORCED HIM TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS MASTER WAS NOT ONLY A HARD MAN AS A DRIVER ON THE FARM BUT THAT AT HEART HE WAS ACTUALLY A BAD MAN
THE MAN WAS FREE THE WOMAN HAD BEEN A SLAVE AND WHILE IN SLAVERY HAD HAD BY HER HUSBAND TWO CHILDREN
JUDGING FROM HIS STORY HE HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME DESIRING HIS FREEDOM AND LOOKING DILIGENTLY FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BUT HE HAD HAD MANY THINGS TO CONTEND WITH WHEN LOOKING THE MATTER OF ESCAPE IN THE FACE
MR MCKIM HAD LONG BEFORE THIS HAD HIS ATTENTION DRAWN TO THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY IN THE SUMMER OF 1832
PLEASE SEND ME THE BILL OF EXPENSE
EVEN HER OWN FAMILY WAS EXCLUDED FROM WITNESSING THE SCENE
ON REACHING THE CITY HE AT ONCE SURRENDERED HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE AND WAS DULY LOOKED AFTER BY THE REGULAR ACTING MEMBERS
THE BRIEF SPACE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS ONLY WAS ALLOTTED HER IN WHICH TO ENJOY FREEDOM AS DEATH CAME AND TERMINATED HER CAREER
CAN GIVE YOU SOME OF MY REASONS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SELFISH
BUT ALL THAT WE CAN VENTURE TO INTRODUCE HERE IS THE BRIEF ACCOUNT RECORDED AT THE TIME OF THEIR SOJOURN AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION WHEN ON THEIR WAY TO CANADA IN 1854
A DEVOTED FRIEND OF HIS EXPECTING HIM ENGAGED A CARRIAGE AND REPAIRED TO THE WHARF FOR THE BOX
THE WOMEN OUTNUMBERED THE MEN
TREASON AGAINST THE UNITED STATES IS DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION ART
BUT THE NEGROES DRAWING REVOLVERS AND BOWIE-KNIVES KEPT THEIR ASSAILANTS AT BAY UNTIL FIVE OF THE PARTY SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING IN ONE OF THE WAGONS AND AS THE LAST ONE JUMPED ON A HORSE TO FLEE HE WAS FIRED AT THE LOAD TAKING EFFECT IN THE SMALL OF THE BACK
IN SHORT THAT HE BELIEVED IN FREEDOM FOR ALL MEN IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE OR COLOR
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS FROM MARYLAND BALTIMORE CO WHERE BLACK MEN HAD NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT ACCORDING TO THE DECISION OF THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
THE CARRIAGE WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FILLED WITH OFFICERS AS A GUARD
WILSON WILLIS 168
AND THE PERSON WHO HAD THE AUDACITY TO STOP HIM WAS THREATENED WITH PUNISHMENT
BOWLER WM 449
MOTHER SAW NO WAY FOR HERSELF AND CHILDREN TO ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF BONDAGE BUT BY FLIGHT
AS PRESIDING OFFICER ON THE OCCASION JOHN BRIGHT M.P
HE CONCLUDED TO MAKE ANOTHER CHANGE

SULLIVAN ADDED FRANK WOULD LOWANCE THE SLAVES AND STINT THEM TO SAVE FOOD AND GET RICH AND WOULD SELL AND WHIP ETC
BY THE WILL OF HIS ORIGINAL OWNER THE SLAVES WERE ALL ENTITLED TO THEIR FREEDOM BUT IT APPEARED FROM ALEXANDER'S STORY THAT THE EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE DID NOT REGARD THIS FREEDOM CLAUSE IN THE WILL
PLEASE TO SEE BOTH MR BAGNEL AND MR MINKINS AND ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE SEEN MY WIFE
HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A FREE WIFE WHO HAD COME ON IN ADVANCE OF HIM
CORRESPONDENTS
IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INVETERATE HATRED OF HIS SON-IN-LAW WHO HE DECLARED SHOULD NEVER HAVE HIS PROPERTY HAVING NO OTHER HEIR BUT HIS NIECE EXCEPT HIS WIDOW THAT THE SLAVES RELIED ON HIS PROMISE TO FREE THEM
MANSFIELD SHOWING THAT HE HAD BEEN REUNITED TO HIS WIFE UNDER AMUSING AS WELL AS TOUCHING CIRCUMSTANCES
ON ARRIVING JOHN'S EYES WERE OPENED TO SEE THAT HE OWED MRS LE COUNT NOTHING BUT THAT SHE WAS LARGELY INDEBTED TO HIM FOR YEARS OF UNREQUITED TOIL
VINCENT IS ABOUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE VERY LIKELY-LOOKING DARK COLOR AND MORE THAN ORDINARILY INTELLIGENT FOR ONE HAVING ONLY THE COMMON CHANCES OF SLAVES
THE TESTIMONY OF THOROUGHLY RELIABLE PERSONS WHO WERE ACQUAINTED WITH MASTER AND SLAVE SO FAR AS THIS MAN'S BONDAGE IN CHARLESTON WAS CONCERNED FULLY CORROBORATED HIS STATEMENT AND THE COMMITTEE COULD NOT BUT CREDIT HIS STORY
WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS THEY TURNED BACK

HAVING RESOLVED TO SERVE NO LONGER AS A SLAVE HE CONCLUDED TO HOLD UP HIS HEAD AND PUT ON AIRS HE REACHED BALTIMORE SAFELY WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED OR SUSPECTED OF BEING ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AS FAR AS HE WAS AWARE OF
CHASE JOHN ALIAS DAN'L FLOYD 296
VALUABLE BOOKS PRODUCED AND PUBLISHED ON INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT SUBJECTS--THESE ARE SOME OF THE FRUITS WHICH THE RACE ARE EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT FROM THEIR NEWLY GAINED PRIVILEGES
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS FACT STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BROUGHT AWAY LARGE NUMBERS OF PASSENGERS FROM RICHMOND PETERSBURG AND NORFOLK AND NOT A FEW OF THEM LIVED COMPARATIVELY WITHIN A HAIR'S BREADTH OF THE AUCTION BLOCK
NEXT MORNING ACCORDING TO ARRANGEMENT THE BOX WAS AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE IN DUE TIME
JOHN DID NOT HOWEVER COMPLAIN OF HAVING A HARD MASTER IN THIS HARD-NAMED PERSONAGE STONE
I THEN POINTED OUT A WAY BY WHICH THEIR SONS MIGHT REACH THE CITY
AT ONCE HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD MOVE TOWARDS CANADA AND THAT HE WOULD BE FIXED IN HIS NEW HOME BEFORE HIS MASTER GOT OFF TO VIRGINIA UNLESS HE MOVED SOONER THAN CYRUS EXPECTED HIM TO DO
THERE WAS A MOMENT MOST CRITICAL IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA AND OF THE WORLD WHEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THAT CONTINENT WITH ALL ITS RESOURCES AND ALL ITS HOPES WAS ABOUT TO BECOME THE HERITAGE OF THE SLAVE POWER
NOT THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF PASSENGERS FAIR ENOUGH TO PASS FOR WHITE WITH JUST A SLIGHT TINGE OF COLORED BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS EVEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF SOME OF THE F.F.V HAD NOT ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS COME OVER THE U.G.R.R
TABB ESQ A HARDWARE MERCHANT OF NORFOLK
QUITE CONTRARY TO THE FEELING OF ORDINARY VISITORS THE AMERICAN DEPARTMENT WAS OUR CHIEF ATTRACTION
PUTTING MYSELF ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION I BELIEVE THAT IN NO LAND AT ANY TIME WAS THERE EVER A MORE DEVOTED SELF-SACRIFICING AND UNCOMPROMISING BAND OF MEN AND WOMEN
MARSHAL A.T
I AM HOPES THAT YOU WILL USE EVERY IFFORD TO GET HIM FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH HE NOW STAND
YESTERDAY BY NAME OF JAMES CONNOR LATELY FROM NEW ORLEANS MORE RECENTLY FROM THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE WHERE HE TOOK FRENCH LEAVE OF HIS FRENCH MASTER
HEAD COCKED BACK WATCHING FOR WOLVES BY WHICH POSITION A MAN CAN SEE BETTER IN THE DARK
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO STOP ON THE WAY AND FOR SEVEN MONTHS SHE WAS UNABLE TO WALK
YOUR WITH RESPECT J.H.H
IS IT DOING GOOD BUSINESS
PASSED OVER THE U.G.R.R IN THE FALL OF 1856
HIS MISTRESS WAS EIGHTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE DRANK HARD WAS VERY STORMY AND A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH AIRY'S MEETING-HOUSE HE LEFT BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND UNCLES AND AUNTS BEHIND
THESE GENTLEMEN HOWEVER WERE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT THIS ACCOUNT OF THE TRAVELERS AS THEIR VERY DECIDED STEPS INDICATED
PAMPHLETS LETTERS DECLARATIONS RESOLUTIONS ADDRESSES PAPERS AND WRITINGS
BUT WE DID BELIEVE AND BELIEVE STILL THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A CONSISTENCY IN A PREFERENCE FOR FREE PRODUCE BUT THAT THIS PREFERENCE IS ENCOURAGING TO THE FREE LABORER AND THAT HUMANLY SPEAKING NOTHING IS MORE CALCULATED TO NERVE HIS HAND AND HEART FOR VIGOROUS EFFORT
I HOPE TO SEE THAT TIME IF IT IS GOD'S WILL
THAT IT HAS INSINUATED ITSELF INTO OUR FREE DOMAIN TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AS MUCH MENTAL SLAVERY IN THE FREE STATES AS THERE IS PERSONAL IN THE SLAVE STATES
ONE OF JAMES BROTHERS HAD BEEN SOLD TO GEORGIA BY PITTMAN ALTHOUGH HE WAS ALSO ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE
I HOPE THIS MAY FIND YOU RETURNED FROM YOUR NORTHERN TRIP,[A AS YOUR TIME PROPOSED WAS OUT TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO

WILLIAM WAS ABOUT THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE AND WAS OF A BRIGHT ORANGE COLOR
IN A MOMENT AFTERWARDS THE BARN DOOR WAS OPENED AND IN CAME THE MEN EIGHT IN NUMBER

BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL ILLUSTRATION
TEN PACKAGES WERE SENT TO YOUR ADDRESS LAST EVENING ONE OF THEM BELONGS TO SUSAN AND SHE HAD BETTER REMAIN WITH YOU TILL SHE GETS IT AS IT MAY NOT HAVE COME TO HAND
SHE HAS A NOBLE HEAD THIS BRONZE MUSE
HE KNEW HOWEVER THAT HIS MASTER BLAMED A SCHOOL-MASTER BY THE NAME OF CONWAY FOR THE SAD STATE OF THINGS IN HIS HOUSEHOLD
I WISH HERE TO CAUTION YOU AGAINST THE SUPPOSITION THAT I WOULD DO ANY ACT OR SAY A WORD TOWARDS HELPING SERVANTS TO ESCAPE
A VISIT TO ENGLAND IN 1834 BROUGHT HIM INTO CONNECTION AND FRIENDSHIP WITH MANY LEADING FRIENDS IN THAT COUNTRY WHO WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT AND PROBABLY HAD MUCH TO DO WITH DIRECTING HIS ATTENTION SPECIALLY TO THE SUBJECT
AND A TREASURER TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE FUNDS
THE CHILDREN ALSO WERE REMARKABLY FINE-LOOKING LITTLE CREATURES BUT TOO YOUNG TO KNOW THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY
HIS SUFFERING AND THE SUFFERING OF HIS FELLOW-BONDSMEN HAD NEVER BEFORE APPEARED SO HARD
IT MAY GO FOR THE FUGITIVES OR CAROLINA SLAVES WHICHEVER NEEDS IT MOST
WE CONFESS THAT WE BEGAN TO WONDER AND WE ASKED A FINE-LOOKING MAN BEFORE US WHAT IS HER COLOR
LETTERS FROM LEVI COFFIN
JACKSON REBECCA AND DAUGHTER 477
THE YOUNG MASTER WAS UNDER AGE AND AT THE SAME TIME UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HIS UNCLE
IN THIS SITUATION HER DUTIES WERE GENERAL HOUSEWORK AND NURSING
A HORRID EXAMPLE PROFESSED CHRISTIANS SET BEFORE THE WORLD WHILE HOLDING SLAVES AND UPHOLDING SLAVERY
NOR DID SHE MEAN THAT HER LABORS IN THE INTEREST OF THE OPPRESSED SHOULD CEASE WITH HER EARTHLY EXISTENCE AS THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM HER LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT WILL PROVE
KIT IS WELL BUT WE ARE VERY UNEASY LOSING YOUR AND JAMES HIRE I FEAR POOR LITTLE FELLOW THAT HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO GO AS I AM COMPELLED TO LIVE AND IT WILL BE YOUR FAULT

OF HIS TREATMENT OF HIS SLAVES NOTHING WAS RECORDED
THREE PAIR PILLOW CASES $1,00
ONE ALONE TAKEN FROM MANY LETTERS RECEIVED FROM HIM MUST HERE SUFFICE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS INTELLIGENCE AND EFFORTS AS A FUGITIVE AND CITIZEN IN CANADA
BUT HIS KINDNESS IN DOMESTIC LIFE HIS LOVE FOR HIS WIFE HIS SON AND HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR RECIPROCAL LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR HIM NO WORDS CAN EXPRESS
HE WAS DRUNK WITH JOY
HE LEFT THAT NIGHT AND RETURNED TO HIS OLD QUARTERS UNDER THE HOTEL
ALL THE EXTRA MONEY YOU MAKE THEY THINK YOU WILL GIVE TO HEAR TALK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST
WHEN WAR CAN ONLY BE AVERTED BY CONSENTING TO CRIME THEN WELCOME WAR WITH ALL ITS CALAMITIES IN THE WINTER OF 1862 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF PORT ROYAL HE PROCURED THE CALLING OF A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA TO CONSIDER AND PROVIDE FOR THE WANTS OF THE TEN THOUSAND SLAVES WHO HAD BEEN SUDDENLY LIBERATED

BUT HE IS DUN FOR EVER I WONT TO NO IF YOUR FRIENDS CAN HELP US WE HAVE A ROAD THAT MORE THAN 100 PAST OVER IN 1857
THE SUFFERINGS FOR FOOD WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO ENDURE WERE BEYOND DESCRIPTION
HE ALSO DECLINED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BALTIMORE AND WILMINGTON R.R
UNDER THE FATHER AND SON JOHN HAD FOUND PLENTY OF HARD WORK AND BAD USAGE SEVERE AND REPEATED FLOGGINGS NOT EXCEPTED
HE COULD EMANCIPATE HER AND THROW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HER SUPPORT UPON HERSELF

I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT MY FATHER'S MIND HAD BEEN LARGELY IMPRESSED FROM EARLIEST MANHOOD WITH THE HIGHEST SUBJECT HUMAN THOUGHT CAN TOUCH
AMONG THESE PROVOCATIONS WERE INDULGENCE IN A GREAT DEAL OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND THE GROWING UP OF A NUMBER OF YOUNG MASTERS AND MISTRESSES

THE PAPERS COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED THE LEGAL TITLE OF THE MOTHER AND CHILDREN TO THEIR FREEDOM AND PLACED THEM OUT OF THE REACH OF FURTHER PERSECUTION
AT THIS THOUGHTFUL PERIOD ARCHER WAS THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE AND BELONGED TO THE TWO LEADING BRANCHES OF SOUTHERN HUMANITY I.E HE WAS HALF WHITE AND HALF COLORED--A DARK MULATTO
I HAD SPOKEN TO ONE COLORED MAN TO TRY TO SEE HIM BUT HE WAS NOT WILLING TO RISK IT
WHEREVER KNOWN HE IS ESTIMATED AS A PILLAR IN THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE
HE HAD BEEN OWNED BY RICHARD CARMAN CASHIER OF ONE OF THE ANNAPOLIS BANKS AND WHO HAD RECENTLY DIED
HOW OLD ARE YOU A
PLEASE SEND ME THE MONEY AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN FOR I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE MY HUSBAND
INDEED HE DESCRIBED HER AS A MOST TYRANNICAL WOMAN
FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HE BORE FAITHFUL WITNESS FOR THE BLACK MAN
SLAVERY WAS CRUSHING HIM HOURLY AND HE FELT THAT HE COULD NOT SUBMIT ANY LONGER
I HAVE HAD SIX CHILDREN
IN THE DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CIRCLE HIS CONVERSATION WAS ANIMATED AND INSTRUCTIVE AND ALWAYS TEMPERED BY THAT KINDNESS AND AMENITY OF MANNERS WHICH ENDEARED HIM TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS
DEAR BROTHER:--IT IS WITH PLEASURE I TAKE MY PEN IN HAND TO WRITE A FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM WELL HOPEPING THESE FEW LINES MAY FINE YOU THE SAME I AM LONGING TO HEAR FROM YOU AND YOUR FAMILY I WISH YOU WOULD SAY TO JULIS ANDERSON THAT HE MUST REALY EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WRITING BUT I AM IN HOPES THAT HE IS DOING WELL
HE IS GETTING FAIR WAGES IN A SAW-YARD AND LIKES ENGLAND VERY WELL IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE THOUGHT OF HIS POOR WIFE AND CHILDREN STILL IN SLAVERY
APPOINTED A PLACE TO SEE VINA IN AN OPEN FIELD THAT NIGHT
GIVE LOVE TO MRS STILL
AS THEY ARRIVED IN PARTIES THEIR NARRATIVES WILL BE GIVEN IN DUE ORDER AS FOUND ON THE BOOK OF RECORDS
HIS APPROACH HOME COULD ONLY BE MADE STEALTHILY NOT DARING TO BREATHE TO A LIVING SOUL SAVE HIS OWN FAMILY HIS NOMINAL JEW MASTER AND ONE OTHER FRIEND--A SLAVE--WHERE HE HAD BEEN THE PRIZE HE HAD FOUND OR ANYTHING IN RELATION TO HIS TRAVELS
BEING POLITELY TOLD THAT THEY COULD BE ACCOMMODATED ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY WAS THAT THE LADY SHOULD SHOW OFF TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE POSSIBLE
OF COURSE EVERY THING WAS IN THE UTMOST CONFUSION AND DISORDER WHEN HE RETURNED SAVE WHERE THE MILITARY HELD SWAY
JOHN EDWARD LEE JOHN HILLIS CHARLES ROSS JAMES RYAN WILLIAM JOHNSTON EDWARD WOOD CORNELIUS FULLER AND HIS WIFE HARRIET JOHN PINKET ANSAL CANNON AND JAMES BROWN
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU AS SOON AS CONVENIENT AND ALSO FROM ALL OF MY FRIENDS NEAR YOU
LET ME HEAR TO-MORROW AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND THOMAS GARRETT
A THIRD VISIT STILL IN BEHALF OF THE CAUSE TOOK PLACE IN 1846
TO ANY CAPTAIN WHO WOULD AID HIM IN THE MATTER HE RESOLVED TO OFFER A LARGE REWARD AND DETERMINED THAT THE AMOUNT SHOULD ONLY BE LIMITED BY HIS INABILITY TO INCREASE IT
WE SUBJOIN THE DOCUMENTS ON WHICH HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM HIS IMPRISONMENT IN NEWCASTLE AND HIS SUBSEQUENT RE-COMMITTAL ON THE OATH OF CAPT
IT WILL MAKE YOU MORE DEVOTED TO YOUR GOOD WORK
HE HAS SECURED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE AFRICAN AID SOCIETY IN LONDON ONE OF WHOSE EARLIEST MEASURES HAS BEEN TO ASSIST HIM WITH FUNDS
THE QUESTION OF CHRISTIAN SLAVE-HOLDERS FOR A GREAT WHILE SERIOUSLY PUZZLED THE WISE AND LEARNED BUT FOR THE SLAVE IT WAS ONE OF THE EASIEST OF SOLUTION
I HOPE YOU WILL THINK ME THE SAME TO YOU
SOMETIMES OF NIGHTS HE WOULD MANAGE TO EARN A TRIFLE HE WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO LIVE BY THE SWEAT OF HIS OWN BROW BELIEVING THAT ALL MEN OUGHT SO TO LIVE
YET HE UTTERED NOT A DISRESPECTFUL WORD AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL TO WHOM HE BELONGED
I HAD TO LEAVE TOWN SOON AFTER NOON YESTERDAY TO ATTEND A BROTHER ILL WITH AN ATTACK OF APOPLEXY AND TO-DAY I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH ENGAGED
THE COMMITTEE COMFORTED HIM WITH THE USUAL HOSPITALITY
THUS FAR SHALT THOU COME AND NO FARTHER PREVIOUS TO THAT PERIOD THE LINE OF FUGITIVE TRAVEL WAS FROM BALTIMORE BY THE WAY OF HAVRE DE GRACE TO PHILADELPHIA
THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN RAISED WITH THE GREATEST INDULGENCE
IT IS BUT REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE FIRST REPORT MUST HAVE PRODUCED A SHOCK SCARCELY LESS STUNNING THAN AN EARTHQUAKE
SHE REMAINED IN HIS FAMILY MORE THAN SIX MONTHS
THE SAME CULTURE--THE SAME COURAGE ON THE PART OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO UNDERTAKE TO ADVOCATE REPUBLICAN DOCTRINES IN THE SOUTH--THE SAME PERSEVERANCE AND INTELLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO ARE EARNING THEIR BREAD BY THE CULTIVATION OF THE SOIL WILL BE CROWNED WITH THE SAME SUCCESS
TELL MR ORMSTED NOT TO FORGET MY BOOTS AND SEND THEM BY EXPRESS
THE SHERIFF AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE ANTI-SLAVERY PEOPLE AND WROTE TO MR GARRETT TO COME OVER
THE MARKET VALUE OF ELIAS WAS PLACED AT $1200
THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN OLD JANE DAVIS--FLED TO ESCAPE THE AUCTION-BLOCK
THIS WAS OBJECTED TO BY MR BROWN AS THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION HAD NOT BEEN REQUIRED SO TO DO
JOHNSTON WHO TOOK SO MUCH INTEREST IN THEM AND SAW THEM JUST BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN HAS JUST RETURNED TO THE CITY
HE LEFT HIS DINNER TO COME AND SEE IF I WAS SAFE AND THEN WENT BACK AGAIN
AND ABOVE ALL THAT HER BABE ABOUT TO BE BORN SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO OPEN ITS EYES UPON THE LIGHT OF LIBERTY
IT IS THIS
HE WAS ONE OF THE WELL-CARED FOR ARTICLES AND WAS OF VERY NEAR KIN TO THE WHITE PEOPLE AT LEAST A HALF-BROTHER MULATTO OF COURSE HE WAS THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE MEDIUM SIZE HARD-FEATURED AND RAW-BONED BUT NO MARKS ABOUT HIM JAMES LOOKED AS IF HE HAD HAD PRETTY GOOD HEALTH STILL THE COMMITTEE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE MUCH BETTER IN CANADA
WE WONT ONE FOR TO GO WHEN CALLED FOR ONE OF OUR BEST MEN WAS NIGH CUT BY KEEPING OF THEM TOO LONG BY NOT HAVING MEANS TO CONVAY THEM THA MUST BE CONVAD IF THEY PASS OVER THIS ROAD SAFE THA GO THROUGH IN 2 NIGHTS TO WILMINGTON FOR I WENT THERE WITH 28 IN ONE GANG LAST NOVEMBER THA HAD TO RIDE FOR WHEN THEA COM TO US WE GO 15 MILES IT IS HARD ROAD TO TRAVEL I HAD SUM CONVERSATION WITH MR
SO THE FIRST CHANCE CHARLES GOT HE STARTED AND PROVIDENCE SMILED UPON HIS RESOLUTION
I WOULD SEND THIS BY HIM IF HE DID
NOT A GREAT WHILE BEFORE MAKING UP HIS MIND TO ESCAPE FOR SOME TRIFLING OFFENCE HE HAD BEEN STRETCHED UP WITH A ROPE BY HIS HANDS AND WHIPPED UNMERCIFULLY IN ADDITION TO THIS HE HAD GOT WIND OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS TO BE AUCTIONEERED OFF
HOW IMPORTUNATELY APPEALS WERE MADE FOR HELP FROM MAN AND FROM GOD
DERRICKSON PETER 309
THEY ARE NOT NATURALLY FOND OF PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS
BUT OHIO WITH HER BIBLES AND CHURCHES HER BAPTISMS AND PRAYERS HAD NOT ONE TEMPLE SO DEDICATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS ONE ALTAR SO CONSECRATED TO HUMAN LIBERTY THAT TRAMPLED UPON AND DOWN-TRODDEN INNOCENCE KNEW THAT IT COULD FIND PROTECTION FOR A NIGHT OR SHELTER FOR A DAY IN THE FALL OF 1860 IN THE CITY OF CINCINNATI MRS HARPER WAS MARRIED TO FENTON HARPER A WIDOWER AND RESIDENT OF OHIO
IT MUST LIVE AND GROW AND DEEPEN AND GENERATIONS HENCE THE WORLD WILL BE HAPPIER AND BETTER THAT LUCRETIA MOTT LIVED AND LABORED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MANKIND
THE ANSWER SUGGESTS ITSELF IN ANOTHER QUESTION
WILLIAM REPRESENTED THE WHITE AND COLORED RACES ABOUT EQUALLY
IT WAS A SOLEMN GATHERING BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE IMPULSE OF FEELING TO MINGLE THEIR TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS AT THE GRAVE OF ONE WHOM THEY HAD LOVED AND REVERED AS A PROTECTOR AND A FRIEND
THEY HAD SEEN HARD TIMES ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLD MAN AND HIS COMPANION ESPECIALLY UNDER DAVID SNIVELY WHO HOWEVER HAD BEEN REMOVED BY THE LORD A NUMBER OF YEARS PRIOR TO THEIR ESCAPE
HER PROFUSION OF DARK HAIR OFFERED A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHANGE
ARRIVES WITH FOURTEEN PRIME ARTICLES ON BOARD
ARRIVES WITH FOURTEEN PRIME ARTICLES ON BOARD
NO OTHER COURSE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT PEACE TO MY MIND
THERE IS NOW NO OTHER SURE PLACE BUT THE OFFICE OR GIBBS THAT I COULD ADVISE YOU TO SEND SUCH PERSONS
AND IS ABOUT HALF ANGLO-SAXON
THE NAME OF THE WIFE WAS LUCINDA
YOURS IN FULL SYMPATHY AND TRUST WM
I TOLD THEM THAT I HADN'T THE MONEY
OUT OF THE GRIM CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER THE SOUTH A BOLT HAS DARTED AND BLOOD HAS FLOWED AND THE PLACE WHERE THE LIGHTNING STRUCK IS WILD WITH FEAR THE RETURN STROKE WE ALL FELT MUST SOON FOLLOW AND PHILADELPHIA WE FEARED WOULD BE SELECTED AS THE SPOT WHERE SLAVERY WOULD MAKE ITS FIRST MORTAL ONSLAUGHT AND THE ABOLITIONISTS THERE THE FIRST VICTIMS
IN FULL VIEW OF ALL THE CONSEQUENCES HE VENTURED TO TAKE THE HAZARDOUS STEP AND TO HIS GREAT SATISFACTION HE REACHED OLD POINT COMFORT SAFELY
INDEED HE WAS FAIR ENOUGH TO PASS FOR WHITE AND ACTUALLY CAME THE ENTIRE JOURNEY FROM CHARLESTON TO THIS CITY UNDER THE GARB OF A WHITE GENTLEMAN
BETSY ECONOMIZED GREATLY IN ORDER TO GIVE TO THE CAUSE BUT ABBY DENIED HERSELF EVEN NECESSARY APPAREL AND BETSY HAS OFTEN SAID THAT FEW BEGGARS CAME TO OUR DOORS WHOSE GARMENTS WERE SO WORN FORLORN AND PATCHED-UP AS ABBY'S
ON FIRST MEETING HIS TWO BOYS AT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD DEPOT THE OLD MAN TOOK EACH ONE IN HIS ARMS AND AS LOOKING THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY STRAINING EVERY NERVE OF HIS ALMOST LOST SIGHT EXCLAIMING WHILST HUGGING THEM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIS BOSOM FOR SOME MINUTES IN TEARS OF JOY AND WONDER MY SON ISAAC IS THIS YOU
SOME PEOPLE GIVE THEIR SERVANTS AT CHRISTMAS A DOLLAR AND A HALF AND TWO DOLLARS AND SOME FIVE BUT MY MASTER WOULD NEVER GIVE ME ANYTHING WHAT WAS THE NAME OF YOUR MASTER FLEMING BIBBS WHERE DID HE LIVE IN CAROLINE COUNTY FIFTY MILES ABOVE RICHMOND WHAT DID HE DO HE WAS A FARMER DID YOU EVER LIVE WITH HIM NEVER DID
BEING USED TO IT SOME WOULD LIE ON THE LOG WITHOUT BEING TIED
I DECLARED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HER THAT I WOULD SCALD HER WITH THE TEA KETTLE IF SHE EVER TOOK THE BROOMSTICK TO ME AND I MEANT IT
IT WAS HEART-RENDING IN THE EXTREME
THE RIGHT MAN WAS SOON FOUND AND JOSEPH WAS OFF AGAIN
I WISH I HAD AS MANY DOLLARS AS HE HAS WHIPPED ME WITH STICKS AND OTHER THINGS
HENRY COTTON
ISAAC DETERMINED THAT HE SHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED
PROBABLY NO INCIDENTS WERE RELATED OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE STILL THE COMMITTEE FELT PLEASED TO RECEIVE ONE SO YOUNG
THOMPSON JAS
THOUGH NOT A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE HE RENDERED IT FREQUENT AND MOST EFFICIENT AID ESPECIALLY DURING THE DARK TEN YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
I WAS UNWELL WHEN I RETURNED THROUGH PHILADELPHIA OR I SHOULD HAVE CALLED

LEVI COFFIN HAD NO MONEY FOR ME
INDEED HE DECLARED THAT SHE DID NOT CARE HOW MEAN THE PLACE WAS IF SHE COULD ONLY GET HER PRICE FOR THREE YEARS BEN HAD CANADA AND THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN VIEW HAVING BEEN BADLY TREATED AT LAST THE LONG-LOOKED FOR TIME ARRIVED AND HE CONFERRED NEITHER WITH MASTER NOR MISTRESS BUT PICKED HIMSELF UP AND TOOK OUT AGE TWENTY-EIGHT MEDIUM SIZE QUITE DARK A GOOD CARPENTER AND GENERALLY INTELLIGENT
FOR MANY YEARS NO-WOMAN LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA WAS BETTER KNOWN TO THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE CITY GENERALLY THAN ESTHER MOORE

WILLIAM IS TWENTY-TWO BLACK TALL INTELLIGENT AND ACTIVE ARE THE WORDS OF THE RECORD
PENNYPACKER--J.C
SOON AFTER THE SEPARATION THEY HEARD FIRING BUT WHAT THE RESULT WAS THEY KNEW NOT
MADDEN THOS 294
THEY WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SLAVES OR TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE AFFLICTING SEPARATION
GAVE HER THE SIGNAL SENT BY PETER
IF IT WAS AN INSULT WHY NOT RESENT IT AS BECAME HIGH-SPIRITED AMERICANS
BUT SHE PRAYED ON AND AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THREE O'CLOCK--BEFORE DAY THE RAIN DESCENDED IN TORRENTS
NOTHING BUT THE DESIRE TO BE FREE MOVED GEORGE TO ESCAPE
TO GIVE ALL THEIR DUE HOWEVER GEORGE'S WIFE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WELL TREATED UNDER HER OLD MISTRESS BUT THROUGH A CHANGE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF A NEW ONE BY WHOM HER LIFE HAD BEEN RENDERED MOST MISERABLE SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO GET RID OF HER AND WAS THEREFORE DRIVEN TO JOIN HER HUSBAND IN RUNNING AWAY
HE LOOKED BACK TO HIS BOYHOOD AND SAW HIMSELF SNATCHED FROM THE TENDER EMBRACES OF HIS PARENTS AND HOME TO BE MADE A SLAVE FOR LIFE
LEARNING THAT HIS VOYAGE EXTENDED TO PHILADELPHIA THEY SOUGHT TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS CAPTAIN WAS TRUE TO FREEDOM
GOD KNOWS I HAVE NO DESIRE TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT
AFTER LEAVING THE COMMITTEE AND GOING NORTH HIS UNCAGED MIND FELT THE NEED OF MORE EDUCATION AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS EAGER TO MAKE MONEY AND DO SOMETHING IN LIFE
SOME HAVE BEEN LOST BETWEEN STORMON'S AND THE OHIO
THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE MEN WITH TWO OR THREE CHILDREN WAS LEFT SOME THIRTY MILES BELOW AND I GAVE HARRIET TEN DOLLARS TO HIRE A MAN WITH CARRIAGE TO TAKE THEM TO CHESTER COUNTY
I WISH TO NOTICE THIS CASE A LITTLE FURTHER AS THE ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY TO WHICH I WILL REFER
THEY KNEW THAT THEY MUST PASS THROUGH BALTIMORE BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW THE OBSTACLES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SURMOUNT IN THE MONUMENTAL CITY
I THANK GOD I AM ENJOYING VIGOROUS HEALTH AND HOPE YOU ALL ARE WELL AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE FIRST PSALM BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE UNGODLY NOR STANDETH IN THE WAY OF SINNERS NOR SITTETH IN THE SEAT OF THE SCORNFUL I WISH YOU MAY THINK OF ME OFTEN AND PRAY FOR ME THAT I MAY GROW A MAN ONE OF THE FOLLOWERS OF OUR MEEK AND LOWLY SAVIOUR
ELLIOTT CURLETT SO ALARMED DAVID BY THREATENING TO SELL HIM THAT THE IDEA OF LIBERTY IMMEDIATELY TOOK POSSESSION IN DAVID'S MIND
OF HIM THEREFORE THERE WAS NO FEAR THAT HE WOULD BETRAY HIS TRUST OR FLINCH TOO SOON WHEN CRAMPED UP IN HIS HIDING-PLACE ON THE STEAMER
AND IF TEN YEARS SINCE SOME ONE HAD ENTERED MY HUMBLE LOG HOUSE AND SEEN ME KNEADING BREAD AND MAKING BUTTER AND SAID THAT IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS YOU WILL BE IN THE LECTURE FIELD YOU WILL BE A WELCOME GUEST UNDER THE ROOF OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY THOUGH NOT BY SPECIAL INVITATION FROM HIM THAT YOU WILL SEE HIS BROTHER'S FORMER SLAVE A MAN OF BUSINESS AND INFLUENCE THAT HUNDREDS OF COLORED MEN WILL CONGREGATE ON THE OLD BARONIAL POSSESSIONS THAT A SCHOOL WILL SPRING UP THERE LIKE A WELL IN THE DESERT DUST THAT THIS FORMER SLAVE WILL BE A MAGISTRATE UPON THAT PLANTATION THAT LABOR WILL BE ORGANIZED UPON A NEW BASIS AND THAT UNDER THE SOLE AUSPICES AND MOULDING HANDS OF THIS MAN AND HIS SONS WILL BE DEVELOPED A BUSINESS WHOSE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE NUMBERED IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WOULD YOU NOT HAVE SMILED INCREDULOUSLY
AND THE PHYSICAL REST WHICH WAS NOW ENJOINED UPON HIM THE LIBERALITY OF HIS FRIENDS HAVING ENABLED HIM TO SECURE HE SETTLED DOWN INTO THE QUIET LIFE OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN WHOSE GREAT DUTY HAD BECOME TO HIM MERELY ONE OF THE DUTIES WHICH EVERY MAN OWES HIS COUNTRY AND HIS RACE
PERHAPS AFTER ALL BUT FEW APPRECIATED THE SORROW THAT MUST HAVE FILLED THE HEARTS OF MOST OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED
FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY WE MAY TRUST THERE WERE FEW SUCH FIENDS EVEN AMONG SOUTHERN MASTERS AS THIS MONSTER IN HUMAN SHAPE
OWING TO MUCH OPPOSITION A VERY FEW ATTEND CONSEQUENTLY LITTLE IS MADE
IN THIS MATTER THE COURSE THAT I HAVE PURSUED THUS FAR THROUGH LIFE HAS GIVEN ME SOLID SATISFACTION
ABRAM THE COMPANION OF LEEDS HAD BEEN LESS COMFORTABLY SITUATED
SHE WAS DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT WHICH FITTED HER QUITE NICELY AND WITH HER UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF COMMON SENSE SHE APPEARED TO BE IN NO RESPECT LACKING

NOW WHAT MAN AMONG THEM PROFESSES TO HAVE SEEN THIS WOMAN FOR TWENTY-ONE YEARS
I HOPE AND TRUST THAT NEITHER THYSELF NOR THE OTHER MEN WILL HAVE MUCH IF ANY OF THE EXPENSE TO BEAR
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR TO HIS MIND THAT A GREAT BATTLE WAS TO BE FOUGHT BETWEEN LIBERTY AND SLAVERY IN AMERICA MR PENNYPACKER FELT IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE SUNNY PATHS OF POLITICAL PREFERMENT INTO THE SHADOWS OF OBSCURE LIFE AND ALLY HIMSELF WITH THE MISREPRESENTED DESPISED AND OUTCAST ABOLITIONISTS EVER AFTER DEVOTING HIMSELF ASSIDUOUSLY TO THE PROMOTION OF THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM

IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE AGENT AT HAVRE DE GRACE BRINGING A FUGITIVE TO THE RIVER TO KINDLE A FIRE AS IT WAS GENERALLY IN THE NIGHT TO GIVE NOTICE TO A PERSON LIVING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
WITH W.J.C.'S SIGNATURE ON ADDRESSING MR W
FOR AS HE LOOKED EARNESTLY INTO THE FACT THAT HE WAS ONLY REGARDED BY HIS OWNER IN THE LIGHT OF AN OX OR AN ASS HIS MANHOOD REBELLED STRAIGHTWAY AND THE TRUE LIGHT OF FREEDOM TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST BE WILLING TO LABOR AND ENDURE SUFFERING FOR THE GREAT PRIZE LIBERTY
I LEFT SAID HE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE COUNTRY
WHILE THIS IS ONLY A MEAGRE PORTION OF HIS INTERESTING STORY IT WAS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY HIM SHOULD THE OCCASION EVER REQUIRE IT
NOTWITHSTANDING HER ATTACHMENT TO THEM SHE FULLY MADE UP HER MIND TO BE FREE
IN ORDER THE MORE EFFECTUALLY TO PROFIT BY ELIZABETH'S LABOR THE MISTRESS RESORTED TO THE PLAN OF HIRING HER OUT FOR A GIVEN SUM PER MONTH
MRS MARTHA HANAWAY THE WIFE OF THE TRAITOR OF THAT NAME AND WHO HAD SPENT MOST OF HER TIME WITH HER HUSBAND SINCE HIS INCARCERATION SERVED EACH OF THE TWENTY-SEVEN COLORED TRAITORS WITH A PLATE OF THE DELICACIES AND THE SUPPLY BEING GREATER THAN THE DEMAND THE BALANCE WAS SERVED TO OUTSIDERS IN OTHER CELLS ON THE SAME CORRIDOR

HAMILTON JUNE 5TH 1858
ALTHOUGH THE NAME OF HENRY BOX BROWN HAS BEEN ECHOED OVER THE LAND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE SIMPLE FACTS CONNECTED WITH HIS MARVELOUS ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY IN A BOX PUBLISHED WIDELY THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ANTI-SLAVERY PAPERS NEVERTHELESS IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT VERY LITTLE IS GENERALLY KNOWN IN RELATION TO THIS CASE
IT WAS PRIOR TO HER COMING INTO THE POSSESSION OF MOORE THAT AUNT HANNAH HAD BEEN MADE TO DRINK THE BITTER WATERS OF OPPRESSION
IT OCCURRED TO HIM HOWEVER THAT HE WOULD BE MUCH SAFER UP A TREE THAN HID IN THE BUSHES AND UNDERGROWTH
THE FREE COLORED MEN ARE AS IMPERATIVELY REQUIRED NOW TO FURNISH THE SAME MANLY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE ABILITY OF THE RACE TO SURMOUNT THE REMAINING OBSTACLES GROWING OUT OF OPPRESSION IGNORANCE AND POVERTY

HOW CAN THEY FORBEAR TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE POOR DESTITUTE ONES--BUT SO IT IS--THERE IS NOT HALF THE FEELING FOR THEM THERE OUGHT TO BE INDEED SCARCELY ANYBODY SEEMS TO THINK ABOUT THEM
AS A SPEAKER MR DUNGY IS ABLE AND INTERESTING OF GOOD ADDRESS REMARKABLY GRACEFUL IN HIS MANNERS AND POSSESSING MUCH GENERAL INFORMATION
ELIZA JANE'S EXCUSE FOR LEAVING WAS THIS
THE STORY OF HIS ESCAPE AND WONDERFUL ABILITIES WAS SPREAD OVER ENGLAND
IT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM WHEN A CHILD AND IN SLAVERY HE HAD BEEN FAMILIARLY CALLED ANDY BUT SINCE HE HAD ACHIEVED HIS FREEDOM HE FELT BOUND TO BE CALLED BY HIS PROPER NAME
THE CASE OF THE FUGITIVE THEE MENTIONED WAS INDEED TRULY AFFECTING
UPON SOBER REFLECTION IT WORKED GREATLY TO HIS ADVANTAGE
SHE REPRESENTED THE MOST LIKELY-LOOKING FEMALE BOND SERVANTS INDEED HER APPEARANCE RECOMMENDED HER AT ONCE
SHE NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING ENOUGH FOR HER HARDNESS OF HEART THEY WERE SURE SHE WOULD REPENT SOME TIME BUT NOT WHILE SHE COULD HOLD SLAVES
IN THIS TRIP HE INCREASED THE INJURY TO HIS FEET SO AS TO RENDER HIMSELF VIRTUALLY A CRIPPLE
SHE LIVED NEAR MARLBOROUGH FOREST IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MD ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM WASHINGTON
STILL ESQ
OTHERS HAD FLESH WOUNDS
AT THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THEIR INTERVIEW HE FELT ASSURED THAT ALL WOULD BE RIGHT
EQUALLY TRUE AND FAITHFUL ALSO DID MR BIGELOW PROVE TO THE LAST
THIS ACT IN ADDITION TO THE TALK OF SELLING HAD ITS EFFECT IN DRIVING HIM TO THE WOODS
CONSEQUENTLY HE GRASPED THE BOON WITH BUT VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY OR ASSISTANCE
HIS LAST WORDS WERE I DIE AT PEACE WITH ALL MANKIND AND HOPE THAT MY TRESPASSES MAY BE AS FREELY FORGIVEN AS I FORGIVE THOSE WHO HAVE TRESPASSED AGAINST ME TO ALL WHO KNEW HIM WELL OF WHATEVER CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY THE TIDINGS OF THIS UNEXPECTED EVENT BROUGHT A PERSONAL SORROW

BE SO KIND AS TO TELL ME IN YOUR NEXT LETTER WHETHER YOU HAVE AT ANY TIME APPREHENDED ANY DANGER IN MY LETTERS HOWEVER IN THOSE BOND SOUTHWARD
A PARTY OF SLAVE-HUNTERS WENT INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD ABOUT TWO MILES WEST OF CHRISTIANA NEAR THE EASTERN BORDER OF LANCASTER COUNTY IN PURSUIT OF FUGITIVE SLAVES
SINCATHANS CANADA WEST
I SUGGEST FOR YOURS AND THE POWDER BOY'S CONSIDERATION THE FOLLOWING PLAN
THE OTHER TWO MEN TAKEN ON WITH HIM FAILED BEFORE HE DID
ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENT WHICH LOOKED REASONABLE AND APPEARED TRUTHFUL HE HAD BEEN WILLED FREE BY HIS MASTER WHO DIED AT THE TIME THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RAGING IN NORFOLK
HE WAS ALSO A MAN OF THE DARKEST SHADE TALL INTELLECT GOOD AND WORE A PLEASANT COUNTENANCE
THE PROBLEM OF BUYING THEM WAS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED BUT HERE OBSTACLES QUITE FORMIDABLE LAY IN THE WAY
THE REGISTER IS THE ORGAN OF THE FIRE-EATERS OF THE SOUTH CONDUCTED BY JOHN FORSYTH HERETOFORE ONE OF THE MOST INTOLERANT OF THAT SCHOOL
HE CARED LITTLE FOR THE MINOR DETAILS OF QUAKERISM BUT HE WAS A TRUE QUAKER IN HIS DEVOTION TO THIS GREAT CENTRAL IDEA WHICH IS THE BASIS ON WHICH IT RESTS
THE ABOLITIONISTS WERE LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED IN ORDER TO TRIUMPHANTLY MEET THE CASE IN COURT
MORE GENTLEMANLY MANNERS AND ADDRESS NO COURT IN CHRISTENDOM NEED REQUIRE

CORNISH SWORN
HE WAS QUITE A GENIUS OF HIS AGE WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM NORFOLK STOWED AWAY IN A SCHOONER AND WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF DICK PAGE ON ARRIVING IN PHILADELPHIA DICK WAS DELIVERED AS USUAL INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE
UNDER HIS VARIOUS ILLS HE DECLARED AS DID MANY OTHERS FROM THE LAND OF BONDAGE THAT HIS FAITH IN GOD AFFORDED HIM COMFORT AND HOPE
FROM THE NUMEROUS NOTICES IN PAPERS OF ALL PARTIES AND SECTS I WILL MERELY QUOTE THE FOLLOWING
HOW DOES THIS STRIKE YOU
HE CONTINUED HIS LABORS THUS FOR YEARS HELPING ALL WHO CAME TO HIM AND MAKING NO CONCEALMENT OF HIS READINESS TO DO SO
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.--THE ABOVE REWARD WILL BE PAID FOR THE APPREHENSION OF TWO BLACKS WHO ESCAPED ON SUNDAY LAST

SHALL RIG HIM OUT PRETTY COMFORTABLY
THE FIRE OF FREEDOM OBVIOUSLY BURNED WITH NO ORDINARY FERVOR IN THE BREAST OF THIS SLAVE MOTHER OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE VENTURED WITH THE BURDEN OF SEVEN CHILDREN TO ESCAPE FROM THE HELL OF SLAVERY
BEING OF SOUND JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION HE BECAME AN ENEMY TO SLAVERY AT A VERY EARLY AGE
HE DRINKS HARD HE IS JUST LIKE A RATTLESNAKE JUST AS CROSS AND CRABBED WHEN HE SPEAKS SEEMS LIKE HE COULD GO THROUGH YOU

SIR:--WE HEARTILY WELCOME YOU TO ENGLAND IN THE NAME OF THOUSANDS OF ENGLISHMEN WHO HAVE WATCHED WITH ADMIRING SYMPATHY YOUR LABORS FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE NEGRO RACE FROM SLAVERY AND FOR THAT WHICH IS A HIGHER OBJECT THAN THE REDEMPTION OF ANY SINGLE RACE THE VINDICATION OF THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES OF HUMANITY AND JUSTICE

DURING THIS APPRENTICESHIP HE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO SEVERE LABOR SO SEVERE INDEED THAT HE NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF HAVING A DIFFICULTY IN WALKING DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM TAKING THE ACTIVE PART IN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BUSINESS WHICH HE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DONE
TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR FETTERS AT WHATEVER PERIL THEY MIGHT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER
HE OUGHT TO BE PUT IN A CAGE ETC ILLUSTRATION
HE WAS ENABLED TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE WHO ASSEMBLED ON THE OCCASION BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN HIS NATIVE STATE
IF THEREFORE WE CAN OFFER THEM AN ASYLUM AND PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENT ON THE ESTATE WE SHALL OPEN UP A NEW UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD OR RATHER ENABLE THE SLAVES TO ESCAPE FROM CUBA BY GETTING INTO A BOAT AND IN ONE NIGHT FINDING THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY COULD DO THIS AT MUCH LESS RISK THAN SLAVES NOW INCUR IN ORDER TO OBTAIN LIBERTY IN AMERICA THE PROPOSED ESTATE IN JAMAICA CONSISTS OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND ACRES AND THE SHARES IN THIS COMPANY ARE L10 EACH L1 ONLY TO BE CALLED UP IMMEDIATELY THE REST BY INSTALMENTS

OF THE MOTHER'S SHARE IN THE TRANSMISSION OF THEIR HEREDITARY FEELING IT IS ENOUGH TO ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF ANTI-SLAVERY WORK IN PENNSYLVANIA TO SAY THAT SHE WAS SISTER NOT BY BLOOD ALONE BUT IN HEART AND SOUL TO THAT EARLY ACTIVE UNTIRING ABOLITIONIST DR BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL
HER MOTHER AND FATHER WERE AT THE TIME LIVING IN ELKTON MD

HE ALLOWED NO PRIVILEGES OF ANY KIND SUNDAY OR MONDAY GUSTA WHO WAS ALSO DESCRIBED IN PUMPHREY'S ADVERTISEMENT WAS A RUGGED-LOOKING SPECIMEN AND HIS STATEMENT TENDED TO STRENGTHEN HANSON'S IN EVERY PARTICULAR

NOTHING SAVE THE DESIRE TO BE FREE PROMPTED JAMES TO LEAVE HIS OLD SITUATION AND MASTER
DR FURNESS HAD TAKEN PART IN THE PUBLIC MEETING HELD ON THE DAY OF JOHN BROWN'S EXECUTION TO OFFER PRAYERS FOR THE HEROIC SOUL THAT WAS THEN PASSING AWAY AND HAD GONE WITH TWO OR THREE OTHERS TO THE RAIL-ROAD STATION TO RECEIVE THE MARTYR'S BODY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT FROM THE GALLOWS BY MR AFTERWARDS GENERAL TYNDALE AND MR MCKIM AND IT WAS GENERALLY FEARED THAT HE AND HIS CHURCH WOULD RECEIVE THE BRUNT OF SLAVERY'S FIRST BLOW
SO THE SLAVE-HOLDERS WERE UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE UNNATURAL DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE SLAVES TO ESCAPE TO THE NORTH WHERE THEY AFFIRMED THEY WOULD BE FAR LESS HAPPY IN FREEDOM THAN IN THE HANDS OF THOSE SO KIND AND INDULGENT TOWARDS THEM DESPITE ALL THIS DAILY THE DISPOSITION INCREASED WITH THE MORE INTELLIGENT SLAVES TO DISTRUST THE STATEMENTS OF THEIR MASTERS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SPOKE AGAINST THE NORTH

OUR HEART MAY GROW MORE HOPEFUL FOR HUMANITY WHEN IT SEES THE SUBLIME SACRIFICE IT IS ABOUT TO RECEIVE FROM HIS HANDS
HIS COMPANIONS ON THAT PAINFUL BUT MEMORABLE JOURNEY WERE HIS WIFE AND HECTOR TYNDALE ESQ AFTERWARDS HONORABLY DISTINGUISHED IN THE WAR AS GENERAL TYNDALE
BUT AS HEROES OF THE BRAVEST TYPE THEY RESOLVED TO CONTINUE STEADFAST AS LONG AS A PULSE CONTINUED TO BEAT AND THUS THEY FINALLY CONQUERED
AND PART OF THE OTHER
CAROLINE WAS OF THE BOND CLASS BELONGING TO THE STATE OF MARYLAND
IN AN HOUR AFTER HAVING DROPPED HER MALE ATTIRE AND ASSUMED THE HABILIMENTS OF HER SEX THE FEMININE ONLY WAS VISIBLE IN EVERY LINE AND FEATURE OF HER STRUCTURE

WE HOPE OUR UNCLE IN BALTIMORE WILL GET THE LETTER CHARLOTTE WROTE TO HIM LAST SABBATH WHILE WE WERE AT YOUR HOUSE CONCERNING THE CLOTHES
UNDER THESE PERILOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THOMAS SHIPLEY WAS DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT AN EFFORT FOR THEIR RELIEF
I WAS OWNED BY A MAN NAMED JOSEPH BROWN
BUT WHILE OUT RIDING ONE DAY HE WAS THROWN FROM HIS HORSE AND INSTANTLY KILLED
HE WAS A SINCERE EARNEST BELIEVER IN THE CARDINAL POINT OF QUAKERISM THE DIVINE PRESENCE IN THE HUMAN SOUL--THIS FURNISHES THE KEY TO HIS ACTION THROUGH LIFE
HE LIVED NEAR THE FOOT OF THE SOUTHERN SLOPE OF THE SOUTH MOUNTAIN A SPUR OF THE ALLEGHENIES WHICH EXTENDS UNDER VARIOUS NAMES TO CHATTANOOGA TENNESSEE
NOW WAS HIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
MY WIFE SENDS HER BEST RESPECTS TO MRS STILL
THE DISTANCE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER TO FLORENCE IS FROM BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE TO THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIVE MILES BY THE RIVER
ROBERT WAS A MAN OF SMALL STATURE AND THE FARTHEST SHADE FROM WHITE
HIS HORSES AND CARRIAGES AND HIS PERSONAL ATTENDANCE WERE EVER AT THE SERVICE OF THE TRAVELERS UPON THAT ROAD
BUT AT LAST SHE WAS CONVINCED AND DISCHARGED HIM AND HIRED ANOTHER BY THE NAME OF JOHN MOORE
I CONSIDER THAT TO BE NEARLY SUPERIOR TO DEATH AND HOPE YOU WILL DO ALL YOU CAN FOR ME AND INQUIRE FROM YOUR FRIENDS IF NOTHING CAN BE DONE FOR ME
HE SAT DOWN AND COUNTED THE COST BEFORE STARTING
MY BEST RESPECT TO ALL AND MY THANKS FOR PAST FAVOURS
IN THE RICHMOND DISPATCH OF JUNE 9TH THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT WAS FOUND
HE SAID THAT HE FELT THAT THAT BODY HAD BEEN THE TEMPLE OF A NOBLE SPIRIT AYE THE TEMPLE OF GOD HIMSELF AND SOME DAY THEY WOULD MEET THE SPIRIT IN THE HEAVENLY LAND BEYOND THE GRAVE
THE HEARTS OF THOSE ON BOARD WERE SWELLING WITH UNUTTERABLE JOY
THE TRIAL ADVERTISED HIM AND SUCH WAS THE DEMAND ON HIM FOR SHELTER THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO PUT ANOTHER STORY ON HIS BACK BUILDINGS
REBECCA'S SYMPATHIZERS AND FRIENDS ADVISED HER AS THEY THOUGHT FOR THE BEST TO GET A FRIEND OR GENTLEMAN TO PURCHASE HER FOR HERSELF
IN OTHER RESPECTS CHARLES SPOKE OF HIS MASTER RATHER FAVORABLY IN COMPARISON WITH SLAVEHOLDERS GENERALLY
ALL LEFT TOGETHER BUT FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS SEPARATED BEFORE REACHING PHILADELPHIA
A FEW ITEMS OF WHAT SHE RELATED CONCERNING THE CHARACTER OF HER MASTER MAY BE INTERESTING TO THE READER WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS HE HAD SOLD ALL HIS SLAVES--BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY IN NUMBER--HAVING PURCHASED THE PRESENT ONES IN THAT SPACE OF TIME
MR MCMURTRIE REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER WORDS SPOKEN CAME WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT OF CONGRESS IN SUCH MATTERS
I AM NOW IN ALBANY CITY

OWINGS
A PURELY ARDENT THIRST FOR LIBERTY PROMPTED HIM TO FLEE
THEIRS WAS NOT A FORCE THAT MOVED MECHANICALLY IN RIGHT LINES WITH LIMITED OBJECTS BEFORE IT
THEY SAW NO WAY BY WHICH THEY COULD READILY COMMUNICATE WITH THEM

WHY THEN DID THE DR BRING YOU HERE WAS THE NEXT QUERY THE DR WENT EXPRESSLY TO WASHINGTON AFTER A YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS TO BE BROUGHT AWAY DRESSED UP AS A BOY AND I TOOK YOU TO BE THE PERSON WITHOUT REPLYING THE LAD AROSE AND WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE
IT WAS AGREED THAT DAN SHOULD GO AFTER THE BOX NEXT MORNING BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND BRING IT TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE DIRECT AND TO MAKE IT ALL THE MORE AGREEABLE FOR DAN TO GET UP OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND GO ON THIS ERRAND BEFORE DAY IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A FIVE DOLLAR GOLD PIECE FOR HIMSELF

MANSFIELD WAS ONE OF THE RARE ORDER OF MINISTERS WHO BELIEVED IT RIGHT TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS ONE WOULD BE DONE BY IN PRACTICE NOT IN THEORY MERELY AND WHO FELT THAT THEY COULD NO MORE BE EXCUSED FOR FALLING DOWN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW UNDER PRESIDENT FILLMORE THAN COULD DANIEL FOR WORSHIPING THE GOLDEN IMAGE UNDER NEBUCHADNEZZAR
IN ATTENDING TO THE WANTS OF NUMEROUS STRANGERS I AM MUCH OF THE TIME PERPLEXED FROM LACK OF MEANS
NO UNDERTAKER IN BALTIMORE COULD BE FOUND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BODY LEFT AT HIS PLACE OF BUSINESS WHILST A COFFIN WAS PREPARED AND IT WAS DEPOSITED IN FRIENDS VAULT
AUBURN NEW YORK MAY 4TH 1857
BUT AMONG THEM ALL NONE WAS FOUND TO MANIFEST AT LEAST IN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD OF PHILADELPHIA SUCH AN ABIDING INTEREST AS A CO-WORKER IN THE CAUSE AS DID ABIGAIL GOODWIN
AT THE SAME TIME EIGHT OTHER NEGROES BELONGING TO A NEIGHBOR OF MINE RAN OFF FOR WHICH A REWARD OF $1400.00 HAS BEEN OFFERED FOR THEM
HAVING BECOME CONVINCED THAT IT WAS AN EVIL HE FOR THE SAKE OF CONSISTENCY AND AS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS RESOLUTELY ABANDONED THE HABIT AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY
I TOLD THEM THAT THEY KNEW THE STRENGTH OF THE PRO-SLAVERY FEELING THAT SURROUNDED THEM AND THAT THEY WOULD BE OVERPOWERED AND PERHAPS MANY LIVES LOST WHICH MIGHT BE SAVED BY HIS CHANGING HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE
THE PEOPLE HAVE MUCH TO LEARN
I AM DETERMINED TO SEE HER IF I DIE THE NEXT MOMENT
TO MY SURPRISE HOWEVER WHEN I REACHED THE WHARF THERE I FOUND MR W HIS MIND HAVING UNDERGONE A SUDDEN CHANGE
FIRST LETTER
IF THE DECISION OF THE COURT SHOULD BE AGAINST HIM HE WOULD BE TORN FROM THE BOSOM OF HIS NOW JOYFUL AND EMANCIPATED FAMILY AND CONSIGNED TO A LIFE OF BONDAGE
AND AS HE HAD HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT CANADA U.G.R.R AND THE ABOLITIONISTS HE CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO HINT TO A RELIABLE FRIEND OR TWO THE NAMES OF THESE HARD PLACES AND BAD PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT IMPRESSION WOULD BE MADE ON THEIR MINDS
HE WISHES YOU TO SAY TO COOK THAT HE GOT HIS LETTER AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HIM CALL ON HIS WIFE AND MAKE KNOWN TO HER THAT HE IS IN GOOD HEALTH DOING WELL HERE AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HER COME ON AS SOON AS SHE CAN
I AM WELL AT PRESENT AND DOING WELL AT PRESENT I AM NOW IN A STORE AND GETTING SIXTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH AT THE PRESENT
PENNINGTON TOM 431
THIS PARTY FOUND NO VERY SERIOUS OBSTACLES IN THEIR TRAVELS AS THEIR PLANS WERE WELL ARRANGED AND AS THEY HAD AT LEAST NATURAL ABILITY SUFFICIENT FOR ORDINARY EMERGENCIES
THIS FEAT HOWEVER WAS NOT PERFORMED WITHOUT GETTING LOST BY THE WAY
AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN HE SIMULTANEOUSLY TOOK HOLD OF THE WOMAN AND MR WILLIAMSON WHICH RESISTANCE ON HIS PART CAUSED MR W
G
THE FRIEND WAS JAMES JEFFERSON OF PROVIDENCE R.I
JOHN APPLETON A FARMER WAS CHARGEABLE WITH HAVING DEPRIVED ZEB OF HIS RIGHTS
I DONE MY BEST TO KEEP MY MISTRESS FROM SUFFERING
THEY WERE FEARFUL HOWEVER THAT THEIR COMPANIONS HAD BEEN CAPTURED
MOST OF THE BOARDERS BEING SLAVE-HOLDERS NATURALLY SYMPATHIZED IN HER AFFLICTION
HE WAS OF A GOOD PHYSICAL MAKE-UP AND SEEMED TO VALUE HIGHLY THE GREAT END HE HAD IN VIEW NAMELY A RESIDENCE IN CANADA
BE THOU FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH AND I WILL GIVE THEE A CROWN OF LIFE BE STRONG FEAR NOT IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS STRONG CONFIDENCE
SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO WOULD GET VERY MAD IN A MINUTE
SUCH AN INSTANCE IS FOUND IN THE CASE OF MATILDA MAHONEY IN BALTIMORE
26TH 1858
THE SOUTH WAS FINDING THROUGH HER BLACKS PERPETUAL DEFIANCE OF TORTURE AND DEATH FOR FREEDOM THAT THERE WAS PERHAPS SOMETHING EVEN IN A NEGRO WHICH MOST VEXATIOUSLY REFUSED TO BE COUNTED IN WITH THE FIGURES OF THE AUCTIONEER'S BILL OF SALE
IMMEDIATELY THEREFORE THE DOCTOR'S BROTHER AND SONS WERE FURNISHED WITH FREE TICKETS AND WERE AS CAREFULLY CAUTIONED AS POSSIBLE WITH REGARD TO SLAVE-HUNTERS IF ENCOUNTERED ON THE ROAD
THE OFFICER LOOKED AT THE BILL AND SAID NO WE DO NOT DELIVER FREIGHT ON SUNDAY BUT NOTICING THE ANXIETY OF THE MAN HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD KNOW IT IF HE WERE TO SEE IT
BILL HUTTON AGED 48 OR 50 YEARS DARK BROWN ROUND FACE 5 FEET 7 OR 8 INCHES HIGH RATHER STOUT HAS A WADDLING WALK AND SMALL BALD SPOT ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
SHE HAD ON AND WITH HER WHEN SHE LEFT A TAN-COLORED SILK BONNET A DARK PLAID SILK DRESS A LIGHT MOUSLIN DELAINE ALSO ONE WATERED SILK CAPE AND ONE TAN COLORED CAPE
HE WAS DECIDEDLY AVERSE TO THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION IN EVERY PARTICULAR
THE FACTS ARE LEFT TO MAKE THEIR OWN IMPRESSION WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT TO EMBELLISH THEM BY THE AID OF IMAGINATION
SARAH MILLS SET OUT FOR FREEDOM LONG BEFORE SHE REACHED WOMANHOOD
SHE HAD EXPERIENCED MUCH HARDSHIP AND HAD BECOME WEARY OF HER TRIAL IN BONDAGE
FRIEND STILL:--YOUR LAST CAME TO HAND IN DUE SEASON AND I AM HAPPY TO HEAR OF THE SAFE ARRIVAL OF THOSE GENTS
IT REMINDED US PERHAPS OF NEGLECTED DUTIES TO THESE PEOPLE AND IT IMPRESSED STRONGLY ON OUR MINDS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ALONG GETTING ONWARD AND PROGRESS WAS A STAR BECOMING FAMILIAR TO THEIR GAZE AND THEIR DESIRES
AS HIS MASTER WAS LOOKING OVER THESE ONE DAY HE NOTICED THE NEW FIGURE AND COMPELLED THE SLAVE TO TELL HOW HE HAD LEARNED IT
GIVE ME YOUR OPINION ALSO AS TO THE PROPOSAL ABOUT THE OTHER
AT THIS JUNCTURE PRIVATE MEETINGS WERE HELD BY THE COLORED PEOPLE AND THE DISCUSSIONS AND RESOLVES BORE A PECULIAR RESEMBLANCE IN SENTIMENT AND EXPRESSION TO THE PATRIOTIC OUTBURSTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
SHE HAD SERVED ONLY IN HIGH LIFE
NOW WHILE CHARLES HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT HE WAS SOUGHT BY THE OLD INTRUDER HIS VERY NEAR APPROACH ADMONISHED HIM THAT IT WOULD NEITHER BE SAFE NOR AGREEABLE TO ALLOW HIM TO COME NEARER
THE SLAVES NUMBERED TWENTY-ONE HEAD
OF HER PARENTAGE OR RELATIVES NO NOTE WAS MADE ON THE BOOK
THEY WERE YOUNG
THEY WERE YOUNG
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NO HORRIBLE TALES OF SUFFERING TO RELATE THE COMMITTEE REGARDED HER AS WELL WORTHY OF AID
SHE WAS THEN A SLIM TALL GIRL LARGER THAN MYSELF

JAMES BURRELL
IT IS PROVED BY THE DAILY RECORD OF OUR POLICE COURTS AND BY THE INEFFECTIVE LABORS OF THOSE GOOD MEN AMONG US WHO SEEK TO DETACH WANT FROM TEMPTATION PASSION FROM VIOLENCE AND IGNORANCE FROM CRIME
WITH SUCH ALLIES AND IN SUCH A CAUSE WHO CAN DOUBT ON WHICH SIDE THE VICTORY WILL ULTIMATELY REST
EMANUEL T
EMANUEL T
THE FRIENDS OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT SUCH A TRIAL WILL BE ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE AND THAT THE IMPRISONED MAN HAS BEEN TOO LONG DEPRIVED OF HIS LIBERTY TO HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS OWN DEFENCE
HE HOWEVER DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THEM
IT WAS A SERIOUS SACRIFICE
I SPOKE IN BOSTON ON MONDAY NIGHT
MR MCKIM THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A NEGRO TRADER WOULD BE THE RIGHT KIND OF A MAN TO SEND ON THIS ERRAND
I ALLUDE TO HARRIET MARTINEAU
I AM EXPECTING DAILY THE RETURN OF AUGUSTUS AND MAY HEAVEN GRANT HIM A SAFE DELIVERANCE AND SMILE PROPITIOUSLY UPON YOU AND ALL KIND FRIENDS WHO HAVE AIDED IN HIS RETURN TO ME
IN THEIR DESPAIR THEREFORE THEY RESORTED TO ANOTHER DODGE ALL AT ONCE THEY BECAME SORT-O'-FRIENDLY"--INDEED MORE THAN HALF DISPOSED TO EMANCIPATE
SMITH HOWEVER HAD ONLY A TERM OF YEARS CLAIM UPON HIM WHICH WAS WITHIN ABOUT TWO YEARS OF BEING OUT
LARGE DROPS OF SWEAT STOOD UPON HIS FOREHEAD AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN LEST HE SHOULD FALL DOWN
SEE P
HE DARIUS HAD BEEN HIRED OUT IN PETERSBURG FROM THE AGE OF TEN
PERISH THE REWARD
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD NO MATTER WHERE TAKEN SO HE IS BROUGHT HOME OR SECURED IN JAIL SO I GET HIM AGAIN
PART OF THE TIME I AM PREACHING AGAINST MEN ILL-TREATING THEIR WIVES
WITHIN WE HAVE THE DEEPEST CONVICTIONS OF CONSCIENCE THE CLEAREST DEDUCTIONS OF REASON
HE WAS ALSO AN OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATE OF THE CAUSE OF TEMPERANCE AND WAS LIKEWISE A READY SPEAKER AT ANTI-SLAVERY MEETINGS HELD BY HIS RACE
RICHMOND WAS A CITY NOTED FOR ITS ACTIVITY AND ENTERPRISE IN SLAVE TRADE
I MUST TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SORRY THAT MAJOR RONEY GAVE HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO SEND ALL THE WAY TO PHILADELPHIA TO RE-CAPTURE HIS BOY TUCKER WHITE AND WITH REGARD TO GIVING INFORMATION OR ASSISTANCE I KNOW OF BUT ONE OR TWO MEN IN THIS CITY WHO WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO STOOP TO DO SUCH DIRTY WORK
AND IS I TRUST A TRUE BELIEVER IN CHRIST
HE WAS A STEADY ATTENDANT ON ITS MEETINGS AND EXERCISED HIS WONTED CARE ON ALL SUBJECTS CONNECTED WITH ITS INTERESTS
I MAY FEEL ALL THIS BUT I MUST NOT IMPEACH THE MOTIVES BY WHICH OTHERS HAVE BEEN GOVERNED THERE WERE TWENTY-ONE MANAGERS PRESENT AT THE READING OF THIS LETTER AND AT ITS CONCLUSION A NOBLE FRIEND OF THE SLAVE MOVED THAT THE RESIGNATION BE NOT ACCEPTED
BOTH OWINGS AND DADE SHOWED A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF SOUTHERN CHIVALRY IN THE LIBERALITY OF THEIR REWARDS
I AGREED TO PAY A MAN LAST EVENING TO PILOT THEM ON THEIR WAY TO CHESTER COUNTY
AND IT SHOULD BE A WORK OF LOVE IN WHICH THEY WHO ENGAGE SHOULD NOT ABATE HEART OR HOPE UNTIL IT IS DONE
CAN I DEPEND ON IT
OF COURSE SAM HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM DR M AN HOUR'S SCHOOLING IN HIS LIFE BUT HAVING PERCEPTIVE FACULTIES NATURALLY VERY LARGE COMBINED WITH MUCH SELF-ESTEEM HE COULD HARDLY HELP LEARNING READILY
I THINK IT WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO
WESLEY HARRIS,[A ALIAS ROBERT JACKSON AND THE MATTERSON BROTHERS
ROBINSON ISAIAH 325
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THEM TO HAVE RECENTLY ESCAPED
THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS OFFER CAN HARDLY BE APPRECIATED
WHEN WE LAST SAW HER ABOUT A MONTH SINCE SHE WAS ENGAGED IN COLLECTING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO RANSOM A FAMILY OF SLAVES WHOSE PECULIAR CONDITION HAD ENLISTED HER DEEPEST SYMPATHY
I HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS
MATILDA AND ALL THE OTHERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FATHER AND TWO SONS RELATIVES OF DR PENNINGTON SUCCESSFULLY ESCAPED AND REACHED THEIR LONGED-FOR HAVEN IN A FREE LAND
HIS APPEARANCE IS IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
THE FOLLOWING IS PART OF A LETTER FROM MR F GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR JOURNEY
TURNER EDMONDSON 117
SAID HE HAD MONEY ENOUGH AND OWNED ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES THEREFORE WISHED TO TAKE HIM BACK TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM HOWEVER THROUGH THE PERSUASION OF AN UNCLE OF HIS HE CONSENTED TO SELL
THE MASTER AS HAS BEEN INTIMATED FOUND BUT ONE SUIT FOR WORKING AND SOMETIMES NONE FOR SUNDAY CONSEQUENTLY IF TOM WAS SET TO DITCHING ONE DAY AND BECAME MUDDY AND DIRTY AND THE NEXT DAY HE WAS REQUIRED TO HAUL MANURE HIS DITCHING SUIT HAD TO BE USED AND IF THE NEXT DAY HE WAS CALLED INTO THE HARVEST-FIELD HE WAS STILL OBLIGED TO WEAR HIS BARN-YARD SUIT AND SO ON TO THE END
I AM IN A VERY COMFORTABLE ROOM ALL FIXED FOR THE WINTER AND WE HAVE HAD ONE SNOW
THIS MIGHT BE ANOTHER CORD BINDING THE TWO CONTINENTS
NOTHING MORE AT PRESENT BUT REMANE YOURE FRENDS ANTHONY ALBERT BROWN
HE WAS ABOUT THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE DARK TALL AND RATHER OF A SLENDER STATURE POSSESSING VERY LARGE HOPES
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU IF IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE SEE MR MINHETT THE STEWARD ON THE BOAT THAT I CAME OUT ON WHEN HE GETS TO NORFOLK TO GO TO THE PLACE WHERE MY CLOTHES ARE AND BRING THEM TO YOU AND YOU DIRECT THEM TO THE CARE OF REV
SAMUEL NIXON IS NOW HERE JUST COME--A SMART YOUNG MAN--THEY WILL BE AFTER HIM SOON
SHE HAS STOOD BY THE BED OF THE DYING AND UNVEILED THE GLORIES OF ETERNAL LIFE GILDING THE DARKNESS OF THE TOMB WITH THE GLORY OF THE RESURRECTION HER MIND BEING OF A STRICTLY RELIGIOUS CASTE THE EFFUSIONS FROM HER PEN ALL SAVOR OF A HIGHLY MORAL AND ELEVATING TONE
HENRY IN HIS STATE OF DARKNESS SAW NOTHING NOR COULD HE KNOW THE IMMINENT PERIL THAT HIS LIFE WAS IN
WHEN HE DIED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO HE LEFT THREE SONS THOMAS JAMES AND STEPHEN THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER THEN ONLY COMMON LIVERS
SHE FED WELL AND QUARRELLED A CAUTION FROM MONDAY MORNING TILL SATURDAY NIGHT NOT ONLY WITH THE SLAVES BUT AMONG THE INMATES OF THE BIG HOUSE
WE ADVISE IT TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR ITSELF AND PERPETUATE THE GOOD NAME OF ITS WORTHIEST CITIZEN BY IMMORTALIZING SOME STREET SPOT SHAFT OR BUILDING WITH HIS NAME
THE DESCRIPTION IS SO HIGHLY COMPLIMENTARY THAT WE SIMPLY ENDORSE IT AS IT STANDS
FURTHERMORE HE ALSO ALLEGED THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS CRUEL TO ALL THE SLAVES DECLARING THAT THEY THE SLAVES COULD NOT LIVE WITH HER THAT SHE HAD TO HIRE SERVANTS ETC
AND FINDING MENTAL PROFIT AND DELIGHT IN THE PURSUIT OF NATURAL SCIENCE
AIRY
IT IS CURIOUS AND HITHERTO UNPRINTED HISTORY TO THE WHITE RACE
DR FUSSELL WHOSE DEATH OCCURRED WITHIN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS NO ORDINARY MAN
MILES GRITTED HIS TEETH AND FELT VERY INDIGNANT BUT WHAT COULD HE DO
HE IS SUPPOSED EITHER TO HAVE MADE HIS ESCAPE NORTH OR ATTEMPTED TO DO SO
HIS BEARING WAS ENTIRELY SELF-POSSESSED AND COMMENDABLE
HIS HEART WAS FIXED ON THAT ONE OBJECT
NOT A SPARK OF FAITH DID HE HAVE IN THE DOCTOR
ONE FACT AMONGST MANY OTHERS THAT MANY PERSONS WHO DO NOT KNOW THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET HAVE LEARNED TO WRITE THEIR OWN NAMES
THEY ARE ALL OF THEM IN PRETTY GOOD SPIRITS AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL SUCCEED IN WHATEVER BUSINESS THEY TAKE UP
ARRIVAL FROM HONEY BROOK TOWNSHIP 1858
THE STORY OF THIS INTERESTING YOUNG MOTHER WHO WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WAS PAINFUL TO THE EAR PARTICULARLY AS THE EARNESTNESS AND INTELLIGENCE OF THIS POOR BRUISED AND MANGLED SOUL BORE SUCH STRONG EVIDENCE TO THE TRUTHFULNESS OF HER STATEMENTS
THEY WERE ALMOST NAKED AND SEEMED TO HAVE COME THROUGH GREAT DIFFICULTIES THEIR CLOTHING BEING ALMOST ENTIRELY TORN OFF
SPACE HOWEVER WAS LEFT FOR THE WRITING OUT OF HIS NARRATIVE BUT IT WAS NEVER FILLED UP
FAR FROM IT
I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT THE PROOF BY THE FOUR WITNESSES HAS NOT BEEN OVERTHROWN BY THE CONTRARY EVIDENCE OF THE TWO WHO ONLY RECOGNIZED HER WHEN THEY CALLED ON HER WITH THE MARSHALL
AND WHO HAVING SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU IN THE STRUGGLE NOW REJOICE WITH YOU IN THE VICTORY
L5 FROM TWO NICE LITTLE CHILDREN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
HIS IS THE CREATION OF THAT OPINION WHICH HAS MADE SLAVERY HATEFUL AND WHICH HAS MADE FREEDOM POSSIBLE IN AMERICA
WHILE HE WAS AT DINNER I SAW A COLORED WOMAN AND TOLD HER I WAS A SLAVE WOMAN THAT MY MASTER HAD TOLD ME NOT TO SPEAK TO COLORED PEOPLE AND THAT IF ANY OF THEM SPOKE TO ME TO SAY THAT I WAS FREE
ANTHONY ESCAPED IN MAY 1857
I MET HER AT AMOS HOUSE I RECOLLECT MY FATHER GOING TO DIG THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH
YET THEY HAD EACH HER INDIVIDUAL TRAITS AND ADAPTATIONS TO THEIR COMMON TASK
TO THE TRADER I SAID
HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE WELCOME CHANGE WITH PERFECT SERENITY AND PEACE OF MIND
MAN WILLED US SLAVES
SAM'S HEART WAS IN CANADA EVER AFTER THAT
IT APPEARS HIS FOUL MURDER WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE FRIENDS OF SLAVERY AND KIDNAPPING BUT AN ATTEMPT IS NOW MADE AFTER THE VICTIM HAS SLUMBERED NEAR TWENTY YEARS IN THE GRAVE TO BLAST HIS GOOD NAME BY INSINUATING THAT HE WAS A PARTY OR IMPLICATED IN THE VILE TRANSACTIONS HERE NARRATED
INDEED SHE TESTIFIED THAT HER MISTRESS WAS VERY KIND ALTHOUGH FULLY ALLIED TO SLAVERY
I HAVE NOT SEEN BROTHER JOHN DUNGY FOR 5 MONTHS BUT WE HAVE CORRESPONDED TOGETHER BUT HE IS DOING WELL IN BRANDFORD
RESPECTED FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--I NOW HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CONSIGNING TO THY CARE FOUR ABLE-BODIED HUMAN BEINGS FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND FIVE FROM VIRGINIA ONE OF WHICH IS A GIRL TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE THE REST ALL MEN
I CALLED AT YOUR OFFICE YESTERDAY TO SEE YOU BUT YOUR COUSIN I THINK HE SAID HE WAS TOLD ME YOU HAD THE CHOLERA AND IF YOU FELT WELL ENOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO THE COUNTRY TO-MORROW
GEORGE HAD HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE SLAVE-DRIVERS BEFORE AS IN THE CASE OF JOHN AND JAMES LEWIS AND WITHAL HAD BECOME DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE
I WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE IN SOME SUCH EXTREME CASES THAT AFTER ADVANCING ALL THEY HAVE SOME PUBLIC FUND SHOULD BE FOUND TO PAY THE BALANCE OR AT LEAST LEND IT
IT MAY CHARM YOU WITH ITS ROBE OF CRESTED SPRAY AND RAINBOW CROWN
IN THE SPRING OF 1863 HE URGED UPON THE PHILADELPHIA UNION LEAGUE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER THE DUTY OF RECRUITING COLORED SOLDIERS
FIRST LETTER ON ARRIVING IN CANADA
THEIR LOT IN SLAVERY HAD NOT BEEN DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF NUMBERS COMING FROM THAT SECTION OF THE STATE
BUT HE COULD NOT WHOLLY RECOVER FROM THE SHOCK HE HAD THUS SUSTAINED
THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT TAKEN FROM A LETTER DATED GREENVILLE GEORGIA MARCH 29TH WILL SHOW WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN THIS DIRECTION
WHEN THEY REACHED THE YARD FENCE I MET THEM AND A COLORED MAN HANDED ME A LETTER ADDRESSED TO DANIEL CORBIT JOHN ALSTON OR JOHN HUNN
DON'T SWEAR THOUGH MIGHT AS WELL
I ADDED ENOUGH TO MAKE TEN WHICH THEE WILL FIND INSIDE
ON SECOND DAY MORNING
GEORGE RUSSELL AND JAMES HENRY THOMPSON
I HOPE THESE FEW LINES MAY FINE YOU AS THEY LEAVE ME QUITE WELL
IT WAS LITERALLY LAYING HIS LIFE ON THE ALTAR OF FREEDOM FOR THE DESPISED AND OPPRESSED WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN WHOSE KINS-FOLK EVEN HE WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH
BY THIS TIME HOWEVER THE SANDY FOUNDATIONS OF OVERSEER BRENT AND CO ON THE PART OF SLAVERY HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY SWEPT AWAY BY THE HON
I WISH VERY MUCH TO HEAR FROM HIMSELF AND FAMILY

ARRIVAL FROM NEW ORLEANS 1857
IF THEY ENGAGE IN THE CONSPIRACY AND STIMULATE THE TREASON THEY MAY KEEP THEIR BODIES FROM THE AFFRAY WITHOUT SAVING THEIR NECKS FROM A HALTER
BEING THUS DEBARRED HE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE
OF NIGHTS UNDER THE NEW REGIME THE SLAVES WERE LOCKED UP AND NOT ALLOWED TO GO ANYWHERE
MITCHELL OF RICHMOND
SO HE RESTED NEXT DAY IN THE WOODS CONCEALED OF COURSE AND THE NEXT EVENING STARTED WITH FRESH COURAGE AND RENEWED PERSEVERANCE
THIS DARK AND GLOOMY SPOT HE AT ONCE WILLINGLY OCCUPIED RATHER THAN RETURN TO SLAVERY
MCKIM PROFESSOR C.D
ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS S.W
HERE IS A LITTLE GIRL WITH HER BONNET ON AND THERE A LITTLE BOY MOVES OFF AND COMMENCES TO CLIMB A TREE
NOTWITHSTANDING MR MCMURTRIE SAID THAT HE WOULD PROVE THAT MAHALA SOMETIMES CALLED MAHALA PURNELL WAS BORN AND BRED A SLAVE OF DR GEORGE W
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS A MAN OF SUPERIOR NATURAL PARTS PHYSICALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY
GRAY HENRY 559
AGAIN FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO THE OWNER HE TALKED OF SELLING CHARLES
I AM VERY WELL AT PRESENT AND HOPE THAT WHEN THESE FEW LINES REACH YOU THEY MAY FIND YOU ENJOYING THE SAME BLESSING
THEIR TARRING AND FEATHERING OF GOOD CITIZENS
HE FLED IN COMPANY WITH FOUR OTHERS WHOSE NARRATIVES WERE NOT WRITTEN FROM FREDERICK COUNTY MARYLAND
WHEN WE GOT OUT WE MET A GENTLEMAN WHO ASKED ME IF I WANTED A BOARDING-HOUSE
I SAY NOTHING HERE ABOUT THEIR RESPECTABILITY
THROUGH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW DR GREENBERRY SAPPINGTON AND HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING AT EASE
HE HAD SLIPPED OUT THROUGH A BACK DOOR AND THUS CHEATED THE CROWD OF THE PLEASURE OF GREETING HIM--POSSIBLY WITH THAT ROUGH AND READY AFFECTION WHICH BARCLAY'S BREWERS BESTOWED UPON HAYNAU
CHARLES IS TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE ALSO STOUT AND WELL-MADE AND APPARENTLY POSSESSED ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR DOING A GOOD DAY'S WORK ON A FARM
FULLER CORNELIUS AND WIFE HARRIET 500
HE WAS A METHODIST PREACHER AND HAD BEEN PRETENDING TO PREACH FOR TWENTY YEARS THEN THE FACT THAT A PORTION OF THEIR CHILDREN HAD BEEN SOLD TO GEORGIA BY THIS MASTER WAS REFERRED TO WITH MUCH FEELING BY BEN AND HIS WIFE
EVEN WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT SHE HAD BEEN DISSATISFIED OF LATE YEARS AND THOUGHT SHE WAS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OUT OF LEWIS
WITH THIS BOLD AND MANLY SPIRIT HE SUCCEEDED OF COURSE
HE RETURNS TO YOU HIS SINCERE THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO HIM ON HIS WAY
I WAS THEN BETWEEN TWENTY-THREE AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD
HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG ON THE GOVERNOR'S PLANTATION BEFORE HIS HONOR GAVE HIM DISTINCTLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE IDEA OF HIS GOING TWO HUNDRED MILES TO SEE HIS WIFE WAS ALL NONSENSE AND ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION
IS THIS POSSIBLE
I WAS OWNED BY A MAN NAMED THOMAS SYDAN A CATHOLIC AND A FARMER
5TH 1857
I ADVISED HER TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND SENT HER AWAY HOPEFUL IF NOT REJOICING
AFTER SOME FIFTEEN HOURS HE DEEMED IT SAFE TO BRING HIS PASSENGERS UP ON DECK WHERE THEY COULD INHALE PURE AIR WHICH WAS GREATLY NEEDED AS THEY HAD BEEN NEXT-DOOR TO SUFFOCATION AND DEATH
SUE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY-THREE OF A BROWN COLOR AND SOMEWHAT UNDER MEDIUM SIZE
HE LEFT NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN BONDAGE
AND I HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH SOME SECOND-HAND CLOTHES TO MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE A NEW PAIR OF SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND SHALL PAY JOHNSON FOR TAKING CARE OF THEM
THESE MEN NEVER SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE I OUGHT OR I WILL BECAUSE THEY NEVER NEEDED TO SAY THEM
THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAME UNDER HIS REVIEW AND PARTIAL CONTROL AS HAS ALREADY APPEARED IN THESE PAGES AND THE SLAVE CASES WHICH CAME BEFORE THE COURTS CLAIMED A LARGE SHARE OF HIS ATTENTION
HAVING BEEN RECEIVED BY THE COMMITTEE HE WAS CARED FOR AND SENT ON HIS JOURNEY CANADA-WARD
FRANK RESOLVED TO TRY AND GET OUT OF DANGER BEFORE TIMES WERE WORSE
LORD HELP THEM
HE WAS RATHER A STEADY KIND OF A MAN HE HAD A WIFE BUT NO CHILD

TOWNSEND A FARMER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE WERE BRIEFLY THE FOLLOWING
AND SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF PARTING WITH THEM WITHOUT SHOWING HER FAITH BY HER WORKS PUTTING A GOLD DOLLAR IN THE HAND OF EACH PASSENGER AS SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE COMMITTEE TO DO MUCH MORE THAN DEFRAY THEIR EXPENSES TO THE NEXT STATION TO NEW YORK SOMETIMES TO ELMIRA AT OTHER TIMES AND NOW AND THEN CLEAR THROUGH TO CANADA
JAMES HENRY BLACKSON
STUERT HE SEEMES TO BE A TOLERABLE SMART FELLOW
FIFTY EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS WHETHER WHITE OR BLACK WHO ARE DELIBERATELY IN ARMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESISTING THE LAW EVEN THE LAW FOR THE RECOVERY OF FUGITIVE SLAVES ARE IN THE ATTITUDE OF LEVYING WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
AS A SLAVE HE HAD FARED PRETTY WELL--HE HAD NEITHER BEEN ABUSED NOR STINTED OF FOOD OR CLOTHING AS MANY OTHERS HAD BEEN
FINALLY HE CALLED FOR THE POLICE WHO ARRESTED ALL THREE
ARRIVING AT QUAKERTOWN PA THEY FOUND FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE WHO WELCOMED THEM TO THEIR HOMES AND SYMPATHY GLADDENING THE HEARTS OF ALL CONCERNED
OF HIS SUBSEQUENT CAREER THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN AT LONDON SHOWS THAT HE FOUND NO REST FOR THE SOLES OF HIS FEET UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES IN NEW YORK
ALREADY HAD SEVERAL VICTIMS FALLEN BEFORE THE FURY OF THE RUTHLESS BAND
EDWARD CASTING AND JOSEPH HENRY WERE EACH ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE
I HAVE HEARD BY MY FRIEND RICHMOND BOHM WHO ARRIVED LATELY THAT SHE WAS IN THE HANDS OF MY FRIEND HENRY LOVEY THE SAME WHO HAD ME IN HAND AT THE TIME I STARTED I UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE HER START THIS MONTH AND THAT SHE WAS ONLY WAITING FOR ME TO SEND HER SOME MEANS
J.B
J.B
OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE HE SPOKE VERY HIGHLY,--SAID THAT THEY WERE KIND TO HIM AND WOULD READILY FAVOR HIM WHENEVER HE SOLICITED THEM TO DO SO
FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO HIS LEAVING THIS HAD BEEN A THORN IN HIS SIDE HARD TO BEAR
YOUR SISTER IN THE CAUSE MRS M
IN SOME OF THESE I FEEL AN ESPECIAL INTEREST FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO HELP OTHERS IN DISTRESS
MEN TALK ABOUT MISSIONARY WORK AMONG THE HEATHEN BUT IF ANY LOVER OF CHRIST WANTS A FIELD FOR CIVILIZING WORK HERE IS A FIELD
WHAT A PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE HAS IT DISCLOSED IN THE PRECEPTS AND PARABLES OF JESUS CHRIST
BEFORE HE WENT AWAY IN THE SPRING HE ASSUMED A NAME WHICH HIS TALENTS PERSEVERANCE AND GENIUS HAVE RENDERED FAMOUS IN BOTH HEMISPHERES THAT OF JAMES W.C
UPON INQUIRY IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT ENOCH WAS MOVED TO LEAVE ON ACCOUNT OF THE RIOT JOHN BROWN'S HARPER'S FERRY RAID WHICH HE FEARED WOULD RESULT IN THE SALE OF A GOOD MANY SLAVES HIMSELF AMONG THE NUMBER

I CANNOT REMEMBER SAID ANOTHER EVER HEARING FROM HER ONE UNGENTLE WORD AND IT MAY BE SAFELY DOUBTED WHETHER SHE WAS EVER HEARD TO UTTER SUCH
THE PROPERTY IS NOT YET ADVERTISED BUT WILL BE AND IF WE DELAY TOO LONG MAY BE SOLD AND LOST IT WAS A GREAT MISUNDERSTANDING THOUGH NOT YOUR FAULT THAT SO MUCH DELAY WOULD BE NECESSARY
JANE AGED TWENTY-TWO INSTEAD OF REGRETTING THAT SHE HAD UNADVISEDLY LEFT A KIND MISTRESS AND INDULGENT MASTER WHO HAD AFFORDED HER NECESSARY COMFORTS AFFIRMED THAT HER MASTER RASH JONES WAS THE WORST MAN IN THE COUNTRY THE COMMITTEE WERE AT FIRST DISPOSED TO DOUBT HER SWEEPING STATEMENT BUT WHEN THEY HEARD PARTICULARLY HOW SHE HAD BEEN TREATED THEY THOUGHT CATHARINE HAD GOOD GROUND FOR ALL THAT SHE SAID
SLAVERY IN ITS MOST DREADED ASPECT WAS ALL AROUND HER CONTINUALLY CAUSING THE HEART TO BLEED AND EYES TO WEEP OF BOTH YOUNG AND OLD
WE ONLY KNOW THAT AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF NORTH CAROLINA ABRAM WAS PROMOTED TO A SEAT IN ITS SENATE
I AM A BLACKSMITH AND HAVE WORKED SIX MONTHS IN ONE SHOP IN NEW YORK WITH WHITE JOURNEYMEN NOT ONE OF WHOM BELIEVES I SUPPOSE THAT I AM A COLORED MAN IT WAS NOT SURPRISING FOR SO FAIR WAS HIS COMPLEXION THAT WITH THE AID OF A BROWN WIG AFTER HE HAD CUT OFF HIS HAIR HE WAS COMPLETELY DISGUISED
BUT FROM THIS IT MUST NOT BE INFERRED THAT GRACE ANNA IS LESS GIFTED WITH THE DISTINCTIVE QUALITIES OF HER SEX
HE DESCRIBED THE MAN FROM WHOM HE FLED AS A RUM DRINKER OF SOME NOTE BY THE NAME OF BENJAMIN WALMSLY AND HE TESTIFIED THAT UNDER HIM HE WAS NEITHER HALF FED NOR CLOTHED IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH HE WAS DISSATISFIED AND FLED TO BETTER HIS CONDITION
I HEARD HE WAS IN PRISON FOR STEALING
ALL HOPE WAS ABANDONED OF OBTAINING A MORE SATISFACTORY CLUE TO THE HISTORY OF TUCKER WHITE
I WAS SECRETED FOR A LONG TIME IN A KITCHEN OF A MERCHANT NEAR THE CORNER OF FRANKLYN AND 7TH STREETS AT RICHMOND WHERE I WAS WELL TAKEN CARE OF BY A LADY FRIEND OF MY MOTHER
HAPPY WE MAY WELL BELIEVE TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM SLAVERY THOUGH ONLY TO HAVE WON SCARELY TWO YEARS OF FREEDOM AS AN INVALID AND A CRIPPLE
ON THIS OCCASION WITH OLDER AND WISER HEADS HE SUCCEEDED
YET WHEN HE REFLECTED THAT HE WAS THEREBY PROMPTED TO STRIKE FOR FREEDOM EDWARD WAS DISPOSED TO REJOICE AT THE GOOD WHICH HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL
M'KIM NATHANIEL DEPEE ISAIAH O
THAT HE WAS A GOOD MAN AND ALWAYS TREATED HIS SERVANTS VERY WELL UNTIL ABOUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE HE ESCAPED
MURRAY YOUNG WAS ALSO OF THE UNMIXED-BLOOD CLASS AND ONLY TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE
THE KIND-HEARTED MASTER THEN TORE ALL THE POOR FELLOW'S OLD SHIRT OFF HIS BACK AND ADDRESSED HIM THUS
THE RIGHT OF SLAVE MASTERS TO FREE THEIR SLAVES EITHER BY SALE OR EMANCIPATION WAS POSITIVELY PROHIBITED BY LAW
I HOPE THE GOOD LORD MAY BLESS YOU AND SPARE YOU LONG TO DO GOOD TO THE HUNTED AND OUTRAGED AMONG OUR BRETHREN
I THINK THAT WE WERE ABOUT AS BLIND IN RICHMOND AS THE AFRICAN RACE IS IN AFRICA
THEIR HEROIC DEEDS IN BEHALF OF PERSONAL LIBERTY OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS DESERVE COMMEMORATING
WHATEVER THE NEGROES HAVE DONE IN THE PATH OF ADVANCEMENT THEY HAVE DONE LARGELY WITHOUT WHITE AID
GOOSEBERRY THOS
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE ANOTHER TRIAL
LIKE MANY OTHERS HE TALKED IN A SIMPLE EARNEST MANNER AND IN ANSWER TO QUERIES AS TO HOW HE HAD FARED THE FOLLOWING IS HIS STATEMENT
NOT BEING CONTENTED HOWEVER THUS TO GIVE UP THE STRUGGLE AFTER GETTING SOME YARDS OFF THEY FIRED A LOADED GUN IN THE MIDST OF THE FUGITIVES PEPPERING TWO OF THEM CONSIDERABLY ABOUT THE HEAD AND FACE AND ONE ABOUT THE ARMS
NOW FRIEND STILL I BELEVE THAT PRAYERS AFFECTS GREAT GOOD BUT I BELEVE THAT THE FIRE AND SWORD WOULD AFFECT MORE GOOD IN THIS CASE
AFTER HIS DEATH I STILL LIVED ON THE PLANTATION WITH HIS WIDOW MRS VIRGINIA TURNER ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO PRIOR TO JIM'S ESCAPE SHE WAS MARRIED TO A MR CHARLES PARLANGE A POOR MAN THOUGH A VERY SMART MAN BAD-HEARTED AND VERY BARBAROUS BEFORE HER SECOND MARRIAGE COTTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN CULTIVATED BUT A FEW YEARS LATER SUGAR HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF COTTON AND HAD BECOME THE PRINCIPAL THING RAISED IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
HEAR HEAR IT WAS NEITHER A SECTIONAL NOR A PERSONAL MATTER AT ALL
BUT THE SPEARS BROUGHT NEITHER BLOOD NOR GROANS AND THE SAGACIOUS MAYOR OBVIOUSLY CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE BUT THE MAYOR WAS NOT THERE FOR NOTHING
I PRESUME THE CAROLINA FREED PEOPLE HAVE ARRIVED ERE NOW
THE FOLLOWING REWARD OFFERED BY THE NOTORIOUS NEGRO-TRADER HALL PROVED THAT REBECCA AND HER CHILDREN WERE NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO GO FREE IF SLAVE-HUNTERS COULD BE INDUCED BY A HEAVY PECUNIARY CONSIDERATION TO RECAPTURE THEM
A FEW DAYS SINCE THE TELEGRAPH THRILLED AND THROBBED WITH A NATION'S JOY
WE HAVE SEPARATED THE COMPANY FOR THE PRESENT SENDING A MOTHER AND FIVE CHILDREN TWO OF THEM QUITE SMALL IN ONE DIRECTION AND A HUSBAND AND WIFE AND THREE LADS IN ANOTHER UNTIL I COULD WRITE TO YOU AND GET ADVICE IF YOU HAVE ANY TO GIVE AS TO THE BEST METHOD OF FORWARDING THEM AND ASSISTANCE PECUNIARILY IN GETTING THEM TO CANADA
DURING A MARRIED LIFE OF THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS HANNAH GIBBONS WAS THE ASSISTANT OF HER HUSBAND IN EVERY GOOD AND NOBLE WORK
HE THEREFORE ABANDONED THIS IDEA AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION STRAIGHTWAY TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BY WHICH ROUTE HE HAD OFTEN HEARD OF SLAVES ESCAPING
LEWIS LEFT FIVE CHILDREN IN BONDAGE HORACE JOHN GEORGIANA LOUISA AND LOUIS JR OWNED BY BAZIL AND JOHN BENSON
THEREFORE SHE REGARDED HIM AS ONE WHO HAD ROBBED HER OF HER RIGHTS AND DAILY THREATENED HER WITH SALE
IT APPEARED FROM HIS STORY THAT HIS MASTER'S AFFAIRS HAD BECOME PARTICULARLY EMBARRASSED AND THE SHERIFF WAS MAKING FREQUENT VISITS TO HIS HOUSE
AS GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT HIS WIFE WHO WAS A FREE WOMAN ALTHOUGH SHE HEARD THE SECRET WITH GREAT SORROW HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO REGARD HIS STEP FOR THE BEST AND THUS HE WAS FREE TO CONTEND WITH ALL OTHER DANGERS ON THE WAY
STILL I LIVE THROUGH IT AND FIND LIFE RATHER INTERESTING
SHE WAS NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE SMALL SIZE DARK COMPLEXION
THE ONLY REGRET HE FELT WAS THAT HE HAD SERVED THEM SO LONG THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED HIS SUBSTANCE AND STRENGTH FOR HALF A CENTURY
WE ARE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT NO CHARGES OF ILL-TREATMENT ARE FOUND RECORDED AGAINST DR M
THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM HOWEVER WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE HIDDEN MAN AND THE FREE GALES OF FRESH AIR AND A FEW HOURS ON FREE SOIL SOON ENABLED HIM TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH FIRST PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND HE WAS SOON ONE OF THE MOST JOYFUL MORTALS LIVING
BUT NOT FOR A MOMENT DID THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO LOOK BACK
TO MR STILL DEAR SIR:--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING THESE FEW LINES TO YOU HOPING TO FIND YOU IN GOOD HEALTH I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU THAT MISS WEAVER ARRIVED HERE ON TUESDAY LAST AND I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WAS INDEED A HAPPY DAY
HE WAS NOW ABOUT TO BE MADE A SLAVE AND WAS DECLARED TO BE THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER
LED ME A FEW RODS TO WHERE STOOD VINA
THE DOCTOR FEELING HIS EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCY IN THE ENLIGHTENED CITY OF NEW BEDFORD DID JUST WHAT EVERY UNCULTIVATED MAN SHOULD DEVOTED HIMSELF ASSIDUOUSLY TO STUDY AND EVEN APPLIED HIMSELF TO ABSTRUSE AND HARD SUBJECTS MEDICINE ETC AS THE FOLLOWING LETTERS WILL SHOW
RALPH GAVE MR KEMP THE CREDIT OF BEING A MODERATE MAN TO HIS SLAVES
TWO CAPES 1 25 CENTS
THE MORE HE THOUGHT OVER HIS CONDITION THE MORE UNHAPPY WAS HIS LOT UNTIL AT LAST HE CONCLUDED THAT HE COULD NOT STAND SLAVERY ANY LONGER
THANKS TO KIND FRIENDS THAT HELPED ME HERE
THEY MET HOWEVER WITH NO SERIOUS DIFFICULTY SAVE FROM HARD WALKING AND EXTREME HUNGER
THESE YOUNG MEN HAD OF COURSE BEEN REARED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES ALTOGETHER UNFAVORABLE TO MENTAL DEVELOPMENT
OH HOW CAN WE PAMPER OUR APPETITES UPON LUXURIES DRAWN FROM RELUCTANT FINGERS
SHE WAS NEITHER THICK NOR THIN
BUT NEITHER THE NECESSITY FOR CONSTANT OCCUPATION NOR THE TEMPTATIONS OF YOUTHFUL GAIETY PREVENTED HIS COMMENCING EVEN THEN THE DEVOTION OF A PORTION OF HIS TIME TO THE CARE OF THE POOR AND NEEDY
WHETHER THEY EVER HEARD WHAT BECAME OF THEIR DAUGHTER IS NOT KNOWN
WILLIAM CARPENTER
HIS FATHER THOUGH RESIDENT IN A SLAVE STATE WAS NEVER A SLAVEHOLDER
NO NOT WANDERING BUT CHAINED DOWN NOT ALLOWED TO STIR A STEP AT THEIR OWN FREE WILL CRUSHED AND HUNTED WITH ALL THE POWER OF ONE OF THE MIGHTIEST NATIONS THAT THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN WIELDED TO KEEP THEM DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DEEPEST DEGRADATION INTO WHICH HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE PLUNGED
MR STILL YOU ASK ME TO REMEMBER YOU TO NELSON
HE WAS A TOLERABLE SIZED MAN WITH VERY LARGE WHISKERS AND DARK HAIR
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE RECEIVED THEM SAFELY FULLY CARED FOR THEM AND SAFELY SENT THEM THROUGH TO THE LAND OF REFUGE
BEVERLY WAS OF THIS CLASS
FOR A TIME FRANK ENJOYED HIS NEWLY WON FREEDOM AND HAPPY BRIDE WITH BRIGHT PROSPECTS ALL AROUND
ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE 1857
ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE 1857
THIS COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED FOR THE TERM OF ONE YEAR
ALSO AS WE CAN LEARN THERE ARE THREE MORE BOXES STILL IN HARRISBURG
AND THAT IF THEY ARE DOUBTFUL EVEN PROVISION EXISTS FOR THEIR RE-EXAMINATION IN THE HIGHEST TRIBUNAL OF THE COUNTRY ON THE STRENGTH OF JUDGE KANE'S CAREFULLY-DRAWN UP CHARGE THE GRAND JURY FOUND TRUE BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST FORTY OF THE CHRISTIANA OFFENDERS CHARGED WITH TREASON
SHE HAS LIVED HERE ABOUT NINE YEARS
BUT HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HIS WIFE AT FIRST UNTIL SHE CALLED HIM JAMES WHEN THEY HAD A VERY JOYFUL MEETING
ABE HAD A DOUBLE-BARRELLED PISTOL AND A LARGE KNIFE
TO ARISE IN THE MORNING BEFORE MY MISTRESS SARAH ANN WAS IMPOSSIBLE THEN WITHOUT MAKING IT APPEAR THAT HE OR OTHER OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BADLY TREATED UNDER MISS TALBURTT HE ENTERED UPON THE CAUSE OF ESCAPE AND SAID
THERE I MET FRIENDS FROM RICHMOND REMAINED THERE SEVERAL DAYS
I AM SPEAKING OF A PERSON WHO LIVES IN P.VA
THIS SUBJECT WAS UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF A CERTAIN JOHN ERNIE WHO LIVED ABOUT THREE MILES FROM BALTIMORE
SUBSEQUENTLY CHEST AND FREIGHT WERE REMOVED TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE WRITER IN WHOSE FAMILY SHE REMAINED SEVERAL DAYS UNDER THE PROTECTION AND CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
MAKE ME A GRAVE WHERE'ER YOU WILL IN A LOWLY PLAIN OR A LOFTY HILL MAKE IT AMONG EARTH'S HUMBLEST GRAVES BUT NOT IN A LAND WHERE MEN ARE SLAVES IN THE STATE OF MAINE THE PAPERS BROUGHT TO HER NOTICE THE CAPTURE OF MARGARET GARNER AND THE TRAGIC AND BLOODY DEED CONNECTED THEREWITH
HER MISTRESS WAS ALSO IN THE HABIT OF HIRING ELIZABETH OUT BY THE DAY TO WASH
PLEASE NOT TO FORGET TO INQUIRE OF MY WIFE RACHEL LAND AND IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF HER LET ME KNOW IMMEDIATELY GEORGE UPSHUR AND MYSELF SEND OUR BEST RESPECTS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
HE HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT TWO OF THEM HAD BEEN CAPTURED BUT RECEIVED NO FURTHER TIDINGS OF THE OTHERS
TOOK A CANAL BOAT FOR HAVRE DE GRACE WHERE HE ARRIVED NEXT DAY
SOME TIME PREVIOUS IN CONVERSATION WITH MR J.M
IN THE WHEELER SLAVE-CASE IN WHICH PASSMORE WILLIAMSON AND OTHERS WERE ENGAGED HER INTEREST WAS VERY GREAT
HOW LONG MUST WRONGS LIKE THESE GO UNREDRESSED
THE DOCTOR OWNED ABOUT TWENTY HEAD OF SLAVES WHEN THEY LEFT
KIND SIR AS ALL OF US IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF OUR ENSLAVED BRETHREN AT THE SOUTH PARTICULARLY OUR FRIENDS WE APPEAL TO YOUR SYMPATHY TO DO WHATEVER IS IN YOUR POWER TO SAVE POOR WILLIS JOHNSON FROM THE HANDS OF HIS CRUEL MASTER
IT WAS A SPECIAL PLEASURE TO AID SUCH A MOTHER
SHE WORKED FOR THE SLAVE AS A MOTHER WOULD WORK FOR HER CHILDREN
ELIZABETH WAS THE PROPERTY OF A LADY A FEW SHADES LIGHTER THAN HERSELF ELIZABETH WAS A MULATTO BY THE NAME OF SARAH SHEPHARD OF NORFOLK
AGAINST HIM HENRY HARBORED A VERY HEAVY GRUDGE AND WILL LONG HOLD SAID TOWNSEND IN REMEMBRANCE FOR THE INJURY HE HAD RECEIVED AT HIS HANDS ON HIS NAKED BACK
THE TIES OF KINDRED USUALLY STRONG IN THE BREASTS OF SLAVES WERE HARD FOR EMORY TO BREAK BUT BY A FIRM RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD NOT STAY ON LLOYD'S PLANTATION TO ENDURE THE IMPENDING FLOGGING HE WAS NERVED TO SURMOUNT EVERY OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF CARRYING HIS INTENTION INTO EXECUTION
PLEASE WRITE ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN AS TO WHETHER SHE ARRIVED SAFELY C
HE SAID THAT HE WAS BORN A SLAVE IN NORTH CAROLINA AND HAD BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES
IN THIS INSTANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WERE FULLY SATISFIED THEY FELT IT NECESSARY TO MAKE INQUIRY OF TRUSTWORTHY CHARLESTONIANS TO ASCERTAIN IF JOHN WERE REALLY FROM CHARLESTON AND IF HE WERE ACTUALLY OWNED BY THE MAN THAT HE REPRESENTED AS HAVING OWNED HIM DR PHILIP MAZYCK BY NAME
JAMES FLED FROM DEER CREEK HARFORD CO MD WHERE HE WAS OWNED BY WILLIAM RAUTTY
THERE CAN BE NO CONVICTION UNTIL AFTER ARRAIGNMENT ON BILL FOUND
SO NO ARGUMENT WAS NEEDED TO CONVINCE HIS FRIEND AND FELLOW-SERVANT THAT IF THEY MEANT TO BE FREE THEY WOULD HAVE TO SET OFF IMMEDIATELY
MASSA I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AT ONCE MASSA PLUNGED HIS KNIFE INTO MY NECK CAUSING ME TO STAGGER
YOURS G.S.N
IN ORDER TO RECALL THE ADVENTURES OF THIS STRUGGLE AND THE SUCCESS OF WESLEY HARRIS IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO COPY THE REPORT AS THEN PENNED FROM THE LIPS OF THIS YOUNG HERO WHILE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD EVEN THEN IN A VERY CRITICAL STATE
ROBERTS EMORY ALIAS WM
YOURS C SAML
THEY WOULD MAKE REMONDS OR DOUGLASSES IF THEY HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
GRAFF EVAN 519
DESPERATE CONFLICT IN A BARN THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE PROCURED GOOD MEDICAL ATTENTION AND AFFORDED THE FUGITIVE TIME FOR RECUPERATION FURNISHED HIM WITH CLOTHING AND A FREE TICKET AND SENT HIM ON HIS WAY GREATLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH AND STRONG IN THE FAITH THAT HE WHO WOULD BE FREE HIMSELF MUST STRIKE THE BLOW HIS SAFE ARRIVAL IN CANADA WITH HIS THANKS WERE DULY ANNOUNCED
I WENT TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE BARN-YARD FENCE WITH A BUTCHER'S KNIFE IN HIS HAND
THE ENEMIES OF THE COLORED PEOPLE ARE MAKING THIS THE OCCASION OF FRESH INJURIES AND A MORE BITTER FEROCITY TOWARD THAT DEFENCELESS PEOPLE AND OF NEW MISREPRESENTATION AND CALUMNIES AGAINST THE ABOLITIONISTS
THE YEAR I FIX BY FOUNDING IT UPON KNOWLEDGE
SHE THEREFORE CONSULTED WITH THE BROTHER AND A PARTICULAR YOUNG FRIEND TO WHOM SHE WAS ENGAGED WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEPARTURE OF ALL THREE OF THEM
TWO SKIRTS ONE NEW
NOW THE SLAVES ARE EMANCIPATED AND WE ARE ALL ENFRANCHISED AFTER STRUGGLING FOR EXISTENCE FREEDOM AND MANHOOD--I FEEL THANKFUL FOR HAVING HAD THE GLORIOUS PRIVILEGE OF LABORING WITH OTHERS FOR THE REDEMPTION OF MY RACE FROM OPPRESSION AND THRALDOM
HE SENT FOR ME IN HIS PARLOR TALKED THE MATTER OVER SENT ME TO THE STEAMBOAT PERHAPS THE ONE HE TRIED TO ESCAPE ON AFTER GETTING CLEVERLY ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME I AM SORRY TO TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO BE TIED
I TOLD HIM I WOULD RATHER NOT IF HE COULD DO WITHOUT OUT ME
SEVEN WEEKS WILLIAM AND JAMES WERE UNDER THE PAINFUL ANXIETY OF TRYING TO ESCAPE BUT CONSCIOUS OF THE SNARES AND DANGERS ON THE ROAD AND DESIROUS OF SUCCESS THEY DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO MOVE SAVE AS THEY SAW THEIR WAY CLEAR
HER FATHER WHO WAS LEFT BEHIND WHEN SHE GOT OFF SOON AFTER MADE HIS WAY ON NORTH AND JOINED HIS CHILDREN
I EXPECTED TO MAIL IT NEXT MORNING BEFORE LEAVING EVANSVILLE
HAVING ALREADY COPIED A STATUTE ENACTED BY THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AS A SAMPLE OF SOUTHERN STATE LAWS IT SEEMS FITTING THAT THE FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL BE ALSO COPIED IN ORDER TO COMMEMORATE THAT MOST INFAMOUS DEED BY WHICH IT MAY BE SEEN HOW GREAT WERE THE BULWARKS OF OPPRESSION TO BE SURMOUNTED BY ALL WHO SOUGHT TO OBTAIN FREEDOM BY FLIGHT
SUCH QUESTIONS AT ONCE KINDLED INTO A FLAME THE SPARKS OF FREEDOM LYING DORMANT IN THE HEART
THE AUCTION-BLOCK AND SLAVE-PEN WERE DAILY IN VIEW
BUT WE MAY REJOICE IN WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY WROUGHT,--THE WONDROUS CHANGE IN SO SHORT A TIME
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF OSCAR BALL BUT ONCE SINCE I CAME HERE AND THEN HE WAS WELL AND DOING WELL
WILLIAM GRAY RAIL ROAD TICKET AGENT AT BRIDGEWATER PROFESSED TO OWN ME
AIDED BY THE COMMITTEE THE JOURNEY WAS MADE SAFELY TO THE DESIRED HAVEN WHERE MANY OLD FRIENDS FROM NORFOLK WERE FOUND
HE WAS SAID TO BE NOT SO HARD BUT HIS WIFE WAS VERY HARD SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WOULD RULE BOTH MASTER AND SLAVES
ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE 1860
ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE 1860
IN THE MERCY OF PROVIDENCE HOWEVER HER REASON AND STRENGTH RETURNED
TO-MORROW I INTEND TO POINT OUT OUR DUTY AS CITIZENS
WITH HER KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRACTICAL WICKEDNESS OF THE SYSTEM HOW COULD SHE BE SATISFIED
16 1858
HAVING LIVED ALL THEIR LIVES NOT FAR FROM THE BAY THEY HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF SMALL BOATS SKIFFS IN PARTICULAR BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE NOT THE POSSESSORS OF ONE
CIRCUIT COURT WERE NOT PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS OR INDICTMENTS BUT CIVIL SUITS INSTITUTED BY THE OWNERS OF THE RUNAWAY SLAVES WHO EMPLOYED AND PAID COUNSEL TO CONDUCT THEM

MARY ARRIVED FROM DELAWARE MOSES FROM NORFOLK VIRGINIA AND HAPPENED TO MEET AT THE STATION IN PHILADELPHIA
A GROWING FEELING OF HUMANITY WAS STIRRING THROUGH THE NORTHERN STATES
BUT HE COULD NOT SEE AN HONEST PATH TOWARDS THE PROFESSION OF ANY DEFINITE VIEWS TILL 1836
SILAS LONG AND SOLOMON LIGHT--"THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN"--OLD JANE DAVIS
WHAT BECAME OF THE LITTLE ONES DAVID OGDEN AND ISAIAH IS A MYSTERY
THIS DARING BONDMAN RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO HIS OPPRESSOR ANY LONGER PERILLED HIS LIFE AS ABOVE STATED
THIS WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR HENRY HE WANTED TO GET SAFETY
AFTER SPENDING SOME WEEKS IN PHILADELPHIA SHE CONCLUDED TO VISIT BOSTON
THE APPLICATION OF THIS MONEY IS INTENDED TO REMAIN PERPETUAL
SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUT HERE I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAKE EVERY DAY TELL FOR ITSELF AND I CAN SAY NO DOUBT WHAT A GREAT MANY MEN CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE MADE GOOD USE OF ALL THE TIME THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME AND NOT ONE WEEK HAS BEEN SPENT IN IDLENESS
HE WISHES YOU TO SEND THE COAT AND CAP OF WEEMS BY HIS SISTER WHEN SHE COMES
YOURS RESPECTFULLY SOLOMON BROWN
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT THROWS LIGHT UPON THIS ARRIVAL
HAD SUFFERED AS WELL AS ON ACCOUNT OF THE AID HE HAD RENDERED TO THE SLAVES ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THIS CITY THE COLORED CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA FELT THAT HE WAS ENTITLED TO SYMPATHY AND AID AND STRAIGHTWAY INVITED HIM TO REMAIN A FEW DAYS UNTIL ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE FOR A MASS MEETING TO RECEIVE HIM
AT THE SOUTH ONE RACE OF MEN WERE SO BASELY WIELDING A GREATER PHYSICAL POWER OVER ANOTHER RACE OF MEN AS TO CRUSH FROM THEM THE ATTRIBUTES OF SELF-RESPONSIBLE CREATURES
INDEED MATTERS WERE SO DISAGREEABLE WITH THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT TARRY IN THEIR THEN QUARTERS ANY LONGER
HIS LAWYER-LIKE LETTER IN VIEW OF THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE CASE CONTAINED BUT FEW WORDS AND THOSE FEW NATURALLY ENOUGH WERE SUSCEPTIBLE OF MORE THAN ONE CONSTRUCTION
AN ACCOUNT OF THE ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY OF SAMUEL HAWKINS AND FAMILY OF QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY MARYLAND ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE
SO TO BOSTON THEY WENT
THE ABOVE TRAVELERS CAME FROM NEAR NEW MARKET MD
SHE THUS DOUBTLESS UNCONSCIOUSLY IMPARTED TO THE SUFFERER A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT
A CASE OF KIDNAPPING HAD OCCURRED IN THE VICINITY OF WEST CAIN TOWNSHIP CHESTER COUNTY AT ABOUT HALF PAST ONE ON SUNDAY MORNING THE 16TH MARCH
SHE ARRIVED LAST EVENING FROM ONE OF HER TRIPS OF MERCY TO GOD'S POOR BRINGING TWO MEN WITH HER AS FAR AS NEW CASTLE
ONE ALONE HAD THAT APPEARANCE AND HE CONFESSED IT REALLY SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS THE SCENT OF DEATH ABOUT IT
I ONCE HAD A SMALL PATRIMONY BUT EXPENDED IT IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE AND NOW LIVE ON THE SMALL SALARY OF A HOME MISSIONARY
I JUDGE HIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN OF IMPORTANCE AS THE OCCASION WHY HE HAS NOT WRITTEN BEFORE
THE FEAR OF THE PURSUERS DROVE HIM FROM HIS HIDING-PLACE AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE WEEK
THAT SHE WAS CHILDLESS SHE REGARDED AS A MATTER OF GREAT SATISFACTION CONSIDERING ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PREACHED TO THE WINDS
YOURS FRATERNALLY IN OUR COMMON CAUSE N.R
THE NIGHT PASSED SAFELY AND THE MORNING WAS USHERED IN WITH BRIGHT HOPES WHICH WERE OVERCAST BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT HOWEVER
SO HE STRUCK OUT RESOLUTELY FOR FREEDOM AND SUCCEEDED
MARIA'S HUSBAND AND SISTER NO OTHER RELATIVES ARE NOTICED WERE NATURALLY FORMIDABLE BARRIERS IN THE WAY OF HER ESCAPE
TIME AFTER TIME WHEN SHE HOPED TO SUCCEED IN MAKING HER ESCAPE ILL LUCK SEEMED TO DISAPPOINT HER AND NOTHING BUT INTENSE SUFFERING APPEARED TO BE IN STORE
WHILE SUFFERING FROM THE FROST HE WAS KEPT IN THE POOR-HOUSE
AT THIS STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCE HE DROPPED THE BOX
THERE WAS TWO LEFT ALEX ABOUT FIVE OR SIX WEEKS AGO
EACH HAD DIFFERENT OWNERS
MOLLY REMAINED WITH US NEARLY A MONTH
I SAID YES
HE WAS OWNED BY THE ESTATE OF NATHAN SKINNER WHO WAS LOOKED UPON BY THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AS A GOOD SLAVE-HOLDER IN SLAVE PROPERTY HOWEVER HE WAS ONLY INTERESTED TO THE NUMBER OF TWELVE HEAD
SCOTT QUITTED THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS AND FOUND EMPLOYMENT AS A MESSENGER UNDER THOMAS A
RICHARDS JOHN HENRY 217
MY WIFE ARE WELL SATISFIED HERE AND SHE WAS WELL PLEASED DURING HER STAY IN YOUR CITY
WITHOUT HESITATION THE COMMITTEE ANSWERED HER THAT TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR ABILITY SHE SHOULD HAVE THEIR AID WITH PLEASURE WITHOUT DELAY
THAT HIS WORTH IN MONEY COULD BE MORE EASILY MANAGED THAN THE MAN
I HERE SEND YOU A PARAGRAPH WHICH I CLIPTED FROM THE WEEKLY GLOB
HE WAS MOST WIDELY KNOWN FOR HIS SERVICES TO FUGITIVE SLAVES
I REC'D MY LETTERS
THE ALARM WAS GIVEN OF COURSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THE NEIGHBORS WERE QUICKLY IN PURSUIT
TO THIS HE TASKED ALL HIS ABILITIES
AND WHEN I STEPPED DOWN THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD HIM SURE
HUNDREDS VISITED THE PRISONERS IN THEIR CELLS TO GREET CHEER AND OFFER THEM AID AND COUNSEL IN THEIR HOUR OF SORE TRIAL
SHE HAD HAD AS SHE THOUGHT SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE UNDER JOSHUA DUVALL WHO PROFESSED TO OWN HER TO JUDGE AS TO THE GOOD OR EVIL OF THE SYSTEM
NEVER AFTERWARDS WAS JACK SEEN IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AT LEAST AS LONG AS A FETTER REMAINED
NINE VERY FINE ARTICLES LEW JONES OSCAR PAYNE MOSE WOOD DAVE DIGGS JACK HEN AND BILL DADE AND JOE BALL
BENTON SAM'L 429
AND SECOND TO APPOINT OUT OF THIS GENERAL COMMITTEE AN ACTING COMMITTEE OF FOUR PERSONS WHO SHOULD HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ATTENDING TO EVERY CASE THAT MIGHT REQUIRE THEIR AID AS WELL AS THE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE FUNDS NECESSARY FOR THEIR PURPOSE
SALEM SEPTEMBER 23 1862
WHEREFORE HE CONCLUDED THAT HE WOULD MAKE ONE LESS TO HAVE TO SUFFER THUS AND COMMON SENSE SAID HE WAS WISE IN THE MATTER
RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON SATURDAY NIGHT 22D INSTANT WILLIAM TRIPLETT A DARK MULATTO WITH WHISKERS AND MUSTACHE 23 TO 26 YEARS OF AGE
THE MAN WITH WHOM I STOPPED HAD A SON WHO MARRIED A WHITE WOMAN OR GIRL AND WAS SHOT DOWN AND THERE WAS AS I UNDERSTAND NO INVESTIGATION BY THE JURY
AT THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR HE COMMENCED SERVICES WITH MRS CARROLL PROPRIETRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HOTEL AT HARPER'S FERRY
JULY 6TH 1855
SHE IS A LADY OF MUCH TALENT AND ALWAYS SPEAKS WELL PARTICULARLY WHEN HER SUBJECT RELATES TO THE CONDITION OF HER OWN PEOPLE IN WHOSE WELFARE BEFORE AND SINCE THE WAR SHE HAS TAKEN THE DEEPEST INTEREST
HARDIE
HARDIE
FORTUNATELY HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE AND CHILD WITH HIM
IT WILL KILL HER I TOLD HIM THAT AS I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE AGAIN SOON I MUST PROCEED
KNEELAND JOSEPH ALIAS JOSEPH HULSON 68
AGAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER HER FREEDOM ETC
WEEMS MARIA ALIAS JOE WRIGHT 185
I RECKON I AM THE ONE THAT YOU WANT TO FIND MY NAME IS BRADLEY WELL I REPLIED PROBABLY YOU ARE THE MAN
LINTON WHOM SHE DESCRIBED AS A LARGE RED-FACED MAN WHO HAD IN FORMER YEARS LARGELY INVESTED IN SLAVE PROPERTY BUT LATTERLY HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SELLING OFF UNTIL ONLY SEVEN REMAINED AND AMONG THEM SHE AND HER CHILD WERE NUMBERED
A DESPERATE BLOODY STRUGGLE--GUN KNIFE AND FIRE SHOVEL USED BY AN INFURIATED MASTER
AND THERE NEVER WAS A MORE EXCELLENT AND WORTHY FAMILY THAN THE WEEMS FAMILY
THE DELAWARE BAY LAY BETWEEN THEM AND THE JERSEY SHORE WHICH THEY DESIRED TO REACH
THIS IDEA OF FREEDOM CONTINUED TO AGITATE SARAH'S MIND UNTIL SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE FORTHWITH
I AM AS EVER THY FRIEND THOS
DAVID 216
I HERETOFORE INTIMATED A PRESSING NECESSITY ON THE PART OF SEVERAL FEMALES--THEY ARE VARIOUSLY SITUATED--TWO HAVE CHILDREN SAY A COUPLE EACH
SOMETIMES ISAAC WOULD BE CALLED UPON TO RECEIVE CORRECTION FROM HIS MASTER WHICH WOULD GENERALLY BE DEALT OUT WITH A CHUNK OF WOOD OVER HIS NO FEELING HEAD
DERECT TO ONE HUNDRED 125 LYDUS
HOUSTON IS A VERY SMALL MAN
AFTER THIS THE WIDOW BECAME SMITTEN WITH A REVEREND GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF JOHN MILLER WHO HAD FORMERLY LIVED NORTH
MY MASTER WAS A VERY CROSS CRABBED MAN AND HIS WIFE WAS AS CROSS AS HE WAS
HE REPRESENTS HIMSELF TO BE TUCKER WHITE YOUR SLAVE A CARPENTER BY TRADE AND THAT HE ESCAPED FROM YOUR SERVICE LAST CHRISTMAS
WHICH WE MAY WELL BELIEVE IS THAT WHEREOF THE POET SPEAKS
AT THE TIME JIM LEFT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN PHILADELPHIA SOME EXCITEMENT EXISTED AT THE ATTEMPT OF HIS MASTER TO RECOVER HIM THROUGH THE POLICE OF PHILADELPHIA UNDER THE CHARGE THAT HE JIM HAD BEEN STEALING AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING LETTER WHICH APPEARED IN THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD ANOTHER SLAVE HUNT IN PHILADELPHIA
AND IN GENERAL FOR PERFORMING SUCH OTHER DUTIES AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY SUCH CLAIMANT HIS OR HER ATTORNEY OR AGENT OR COMMISSIONER IN THE PREMISES
IN FACT HE RESOLVED TO GET HER OFF FIRST THEN TO TRY AND ESCAPE HIMSELF IF POSSIBLE
RICHARDSON MRS ANNE H 593 604-605-606-607-608
NOVEMBER 1ST 1871
NEW YORK NOV
ACCORDING TO PASCAL'S STORY WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY TRUE HIS PREVIOUS MASTER WAS HIS OWN FATHER JOHN QUANTENCE WHO HAD ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED PASCAL AS HIS CHILD WHOM HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TELL PEOPLE HE SHOULD SET FREE
WITNESS_.--I WAS PLEDGED NOT TO TELL THE NAME
THE TWO MEN CAME SAFELY YESTERDAY BUT WENT TO GIBBS HE HAS FRIENDS ON BOARD THE BOAT WHO ARE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FUGITIVES AND SEND THEM WHEN FOUND TO HIS HOUSE
BESIDES HAVING HIS FOOD CLOTHING AND DOCTOR'S EXPENSES TO MEET HE HAD TO PAY THE VERY KIND AND TENDER-HEARTED WIDOW $12.50 PER MONTH AND HEAD TAX TO THE STATE AMOUNTING TO TWENTY-FIVE CENTS PER MONTH
SO WHEN HE HAD MANAGED TO LAY BY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILLINGLY OFFERED THIS SUM TO CAPTAIN B IF HE WOULD ENGAGE TO DELIVER HIS WIFE INTO THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA
HE WAS MARRIED JANUARY 24TH 1832 TO MARTHA DAUGHTER OF SAMUEL AND SUSANNA MAULSBY
HE FOUND THE PROF GENTLEMAN A PERFECT GENTLEMAN
CARE OF WILLIAM STILL 107 FIFTH ST PHILADELPHIA PENN
HE OPENED A SUNDAY-SCHOOL FOR COLORED ADULTS WHICH WAS NUMEROUSLY ATTENDED IN WEST BROADWAY NEW YORK AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING
WE MAY NOTWITHSTANDING REASONABLY INFER THAT THE UNDERGROUND HAS COME IN FOR A LIBERAL SHARE OF HIS INDIGNATION AND WRATH
THE POPULAR DOCTRINE OF HUMAN DEPRAVITY SAYS MRS MOTT NEVER COMMENDED ITSELF TO MY REASON OR CONSCIENCE
VERY BAD WORSE THAN HE WAS AS FUR AS SHE COULD BE HAVING BEEN STINTED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND WORKED HARD WAS THE APOLOGY OFFERED BY LEVIN FOR RUNNING OFF
ARRIVAL FROM ARLINGTON MD 1857
IF THE BOY HAD LIVED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY-THREE OR TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OLD
I NEVER WROTE MYSELF BUT MY FRIEND MR HENRY DID
COPY OF ORDER OF RE-COMMITMENT
I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO SAVE MY COUNTRY FROM RUIN
MAYO AND PLEASE TO SEND IT AS DIRECTED
YOU COMMENCED YOUR CRUSADE AGAINST SLAVERY IN ISOLATION IN WEAKNESS AND IN OBSCURITY
MR AND MRS HARRIS WISH TO BE GRATEFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOURS
HE LEFT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEHIND
$100 REWARD--FOR THE APPREHENSION AND DELIVERY TO US OF A MULATTO MAN NAMED JOHN MASSENBERG OR JOHN HENRY PETTIFOOT WHO HAS BEEN PASSING AS FREE UNDER THE NAME OF SYDNEY
THE DAY I LEFT THEY HAD TO TIE ME TO BEAT ME WHAT ABOUT I COULD NOT TELL
CAN'T TELL WHEN I LAST SAW HIM
PRIOR TO THIS AFFLICTION IN ANSWER TO OUR REQUEST HE FURNISHED SOME REMINISCENCES OF HIS LABORS AS CONDUCTOR OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND AT THE SAME TIME PROMISED OTHER FACTS RELATIVE TO HIS LIFE BUT FOR THE REASON ASSIGNED THEY WERE NOT WORKED UP WHICH IS TO BE REGRETTED
I HAD A VERY PLEASANT TRIP FROM YOUR HOUSE THAT MORNING
GIDDINGS WHO WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A MILD MAN HE HAD ALLOWED STEPHEN HER HUSBAND TO BUY HIMSELF AND FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT HE HAD BEEN WHAT WAS CALLED A FREE MAN
AT THE MINES HE WAS TREATED VERY BRUTALLY BUT AT CORNELIUS HALL'S TOBACCO FACTORY THE SUFFERING HE HAD TO ENDURE SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE
ON GOING INTO THE ROOM I SAW THEM LYING ABOUT ON THE BALES AND BOXES OF CLOTHING DESTINED FOR OUR VARIOUS MISSIONARY STATIONS FATIGUED AS THEY DOUBTLESS WERE AFTER THEIR SLEEPLESS AND PROTRACTED STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM
HE WAS A SAVAGE BLUFF RED FACE-LOOKING CONCERN THUS IN THE MOST EARNEST AS WELL AS IN AN INTELLIGENT MANNER CHARLES DESCRIBED THE MAN AQUILA CAIN WHO HAD HITHERTO HELD HIM UNDER THE YOKE
OWENS TO WHOM HE BELONGED
SHE RAN OFF IN THE FALL OF 1828
MEN WHO HAD BEEN SLAVES THEMSELVES AND SOME WHO HAD AIDED IN THE ESCAPE OF INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES URGED THESE SENTIMENTS ON MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE HEARTS WERE ALMOST BREAKING OVER THE THOUGHT THAT THEIR DEAREST AND BEST FRIENDS WERE IN CHAINS IN THE PRISON-HOUSE
SETH CONCKLIN WAS NATURALLY TOO SINGULARLY SYMPATHETIC AND HUMANE NOT TO FEEL NOW FOR PETER AND ESPECIALLY FOR HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN LEFT IN BONDS AS BOUND WITH THEM
THE SEPARATION FROM THEM WAS A TRIAL SUCH AS RARELY FALLS TO THE LOT OF MORTALS
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PUBLISHED DECLARATIONS MADE BY ABOLITIONISTS AND FUGITIVES TO THE EFFECT THAT SLAVE-HOLDERS AND SLAVE-CATCHERS IN VISITING MASSACHUSETTS IN PURSUIT OF THEIR RUNAWAY PROPERTY WOULD BE MET BY JUST SUCH WEAPONS AS THEODORE PARKER PRESENTED WILLIAM WITH TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL BOSTON THE OWNERS OF WILLIAM AND ELLEN ACTUALLY HAD THE EFFRONTERY TO ATTEMPT THEIR RECAPTURE UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
THAT SOME MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM IN THE PURSUIT WERE AT THE SAME TIME AND BY THE SAME PARTY MALTREATED AND GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
SO THEY STOOD SELF-CONSECRATED ENVELOPED BY THE LOVE OF GOD PERMEATED BY THE LOVE OF MAN,--TWIN PERFECT LOVES THAT CAST OUT ALL DREAM OF FEAR
WELL THANK GOD THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT FAIL US THAT THE FIERCE RUMBLING OF DEMOCRATIC THUNDER DID NOT SHAKE FROM HIS HAND THE BOLT HE LEVELED AGAINST SLAVERY
IN SHORT BECAUSE HE HELD A STEADY FAITH IN MEN'S HUMANE PROMPTINGS WHEN ULTIMATELY REACHED HE CRIED ALOUD TO THEM BY EVERY ACCESS AND SPARED NOT TO CALL THEM FROM THEIR TIMIDITY AND TIME-SERVING TO MANLY UTTERANCE THROUGH THE BALLOT-BOX
HIS BRUTAL PURPOSES WERE ONLY FRUSTRATED BY THE UTMOST RESOLUTION
HERE IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD
WHEN HE IS DRAGGED BACK TO ALABAMA I FEAR THEY WILL GO FAR BEYOND THE UTMOST RIGOR OF THE LAW AND VENT THEIR SAVAGE CRUELTY UPON HIM
HARPER RUTH 472
THE FIRST VIEW OF THE OCEAN MAY FILL YOU WITH STRANGE DELIGHT
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE FEARS HE RECEIVED HIS FOOD FROM THE SLOP TUB SECURING THIS DIET IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT AFTER ALL WAS STILL AND QUIET AROUND THE HOTEL
AFTER REACHING THE CITY HAVING SUFFERED SEVERELY WHILE COMING SHE WAS INVITED TO REMAIN UNTIL SOMEWHAT RECRUITED
BEFORE THIS WATCHFUL AND RESOLUTE PURPOSE THE WAY OPENED AND HE SOON FOUND IT COMPARATIVELY EASY TO FIND HIS WAY FROM MARYLAND TO PENNSYLVANIA AND LIKEWISE INTO THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE TO WHOM HE MADE KNOWN FULLY THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WHENCE HE HAD FLED THE DANGERS HE WAS EXPOSED TO FROM SLAVE-HUNTERS AND THE STRONG HOPE HE CHERISHED OF REACHING FREE LAND SOON
EDMUND TURNER
CHARLES GAVE HIM THE CREDIT OF BEING AS MILD A SPECIMEN OF A SLAVEHOLDER AS THAT REGION OF COUNTRY COULD CLAIM WHEN IN A SOBER MOOD BUT WHEN DRUNK EVERY THING WENT WRONG WITH HIM NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM
WHEN HE HUNG UPON THE CROSS HIS POOR BROKEN HEARTED DISCIPLES COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROVIDENCE
SUDDENLY HOWEVER HE WAS TAKEN ILL WITH PARALYSIS WHICH CONFINED HIM TO HIS BED
I HAVE BEEN TREATED AS BAD AS A MAN COULD BE
FROM THE SAME PAPER OF JANUARY 30TH 1871 WE EXTRACT AN ACCOUNT OF THE FUNERAL OBSEQUIES WHICH TOOK PLACE ON SATURDAY JANUARY 28TH
NOTWITHSTANDING A FEELING OF VERY GREAT GRATIFICATION EXISTED IN VIEW OF THE SUCCESS ATTENDING THE NEW AND ADVENTUROUS MODES OF TRAVELING
THE LAW YOU KNOW AUTHORIZES ARRESTS TO BE MADE WITH OR WITHOUT PROCESS AND NOTHING IS EASIER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THAN TO KIDNAP PERSONS WHO ARE FREE BORN
I HAVE NOT MEANS OR WOULD AT ONCE GIVE HER THOSE ADVANTAGES SHE NEEDS
THE GOVERNOR OWNED LARGE PLANTATIONS AND WAS INTERESTED IN RAISING COTTON CORN AND PEAS AND WAS ALSO A PRACTICAL PLANTER
THE NEXT ARRIVAL NUMBERED FOUR PASSENGERS AND CAME UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MOSES HARRIET TUBMAN FROM MARYLAND
SEEKING DILIGENTLY HE HAD FOUND MEANS BY WHICH HE COULD CARRY HIS DESIGNS INTO EXECUTION
IN FAVOR OF WHAT WE FAVOR
THEY TURNED AND TOOK ANOTHER ROAD AND CAME OUT AT STUBB'S MILL MAKING FOR THE MARYLAND LINE WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED
HE WAS TALL ENOUGH HOWEVER TO PASS FOR A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY
HE WAS A LARGE STOUT MAN DON'T SWEAR BUT LIES AND CHEATS JOE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED VERY WELL ALL HIS LIFE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BEING DEPRIVED OF HIS FREEDOM
BOX ONE OF WHICH WAS ALSO IN THE LEDGER OFFICE THROUGH A MISTAKE AND SEEING THAT IT BORE THE NAME OF A WELL-KNOWN SLAVE-CATCHER ALBERTI THE CLERK HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO KNOW ITS IMPORT
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANY OF MY FRIENDS AT RICHMOND
INGRAHAM EQUALLY AS NOTORIOUS AS A COUNSEL OF SLAVE-HUNTERS WHOM EVERYBODY HERE DESPISES MIGHT HAVE SERVED YOU IN THIS MATTER
CHARLES WAS EQUALLY READY AND WILLING TO ENTER INTO ANY PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS BY WHICH HE COULD GET RID OF HIS NO-PAY TASK-MASTER AND BE LANDED SAFELY IN CANADA
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD IF THEY ARE DELIVERED TO ME IN WASHINGTON

YOU ARE ENTITLED TO YOUR FREEDOM ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF PENNSYLVANIA HAVING BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE STATE BY YOUR OWNER
I WAS IN HOPES THEE WOULD GO AND SEE WITH THY OWN EYES HOW THINGS GO ON IN THAT REGION OF FUGITIVES AND IF IT'S A GOODLY LAND TO LIVE IN
AFTER BEING FURNISHED WITH FOOD CLOTHING AND FREE TICKETS THEY WERE FORWARDED ON IN TRIUMPH AND FULL OF HOPE
WHEN YOU ANSWER USE THE WORD GOODS
THE HOPES OF HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THIS PARTICULAR WERE IN THE LAPSE OF TIME FULLY REALIZED
HIS MASTER WAS A MEMBER OF THE CENTURY METHODIST CHURCH AS WAS ALSO HIS WIFE AND FAMILY
THE REST OF THE PARTY AFTER FIRING THEIR REVOLVERS FLED PRECIPITATELY THROUGH THE CORN AND TO THE WOODS PURSUED BY SOME OF THE BLACKS
HAPPILY FOR THE PRISONER HE WAS YET EMBRACED UNDER THE PROVISION OF THAT CONSTITUTION WHICH SECURED TO HIM THE PROTECTION OF A HABEAS CORPUS AND THIS THREW AROUND HIM A SHIELD WHICH HIS ENEMIES COULD NOT PENETRATE
PLEASE TO LET ME KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT TO YOU TO GO TO NEW YORK IF IT IS PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT IS THE EXPENSE

YOU WILL PLEASE ATTEND TO IT AND ADDRESS A LETTER TO HIM WALKER IN MY CARE
JOHN WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE SMART POSSESSED GOOD MANNERS AND A MULATTO
THE COMMITTEE WAS GLAD TO INFORM HER THAT HER HUSBAND HAD SAFELY PASSED ON TO CANADA AND THAT SHE WOULD BE AIDED ON ALSO WHERE THEY COULD ENJOY FREEDOM IN A FREE COUNTRY
TWO BOXES CONTAINING THE YOUNG MEN ALLUDED TO ABOVE AFTER HAVING BEEN DULY EXPRESSED AND SOME DISTANCE ON THE ROAD WERE THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE TELEGRAPH BETRAYED AND THE HEROIC YOUNG FUGITIVES WERE CAPTURED IN THEIR BOXES AND DRAGGED BACK TO HOPELESS BONDAGE

AT SEAFORD DELAWARE JAMES WAS HELD IN BONDS UNDER A SLAVE-HOLDER CALLED SAMUEL LEWIS WHO FOLLOWED FARMING
UNTIL THE DAY WHEN THE MILLIONS OF FETTERS WERE BROKEN NOTHING GAVE SO MUCH PAIN TO HUSBANDS AND WIVES AS THESE HEART-BREAKING SEPARATIONS
HE WAS PURSUED BUT NOT CAPTURED
AT LEAST THE WRITER WILL NOT ATTEMPT IT HERE BUT WILL AT ONCE INTRODUCE A WITNESS WHO MET THE NOBLE CONCKLIN AND THE PANTING FUGITIVES IN INDIANA AND PROFFERED THEM SYMPATHY AND ADVICE
THEY BORE EVERY MARK OF DETERMINED MANHOOD
UP TO THE HOUR OF SETTING OUT ON THEIR LONELY AND FATIGUING JOURNEY ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING CAREFULLY COMPLETED SO THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DELAY OF ANY KIND
ON THE OTHER HAND THE OCCASION WAS RAPIDLY AWAKENING THOUSANDS DAILY WHO HAD HITHERTO MANIFESTED LITTLE OR NO INTEREST AT ALL ON THE SUBJECT TO THE WRONGS OF THE SLAVE
IN HIS BUSINESS-LIKE TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT CONCEALMENT HE PLACES MATTERS IN SUCH A LIGHT THAT THE WAYFARING MAN THOUGH A FOOL NEED NOT ERR AS MAY HERE BE SEEN
THE CHIEF FOOD ALLOWED THE SLAVES ON THE PLANTATION CONSISTED OF THE POT LIQUOR IN WHICH THE PORK WAS BOILED WITH INDIAN-MEAL BREAD
AFTER HAVING FLED FOR REFUGE TO CANADA AND HAVING BECOME A PARTAKER OF IMPARTIAL FREEDOM UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN TO MANY IT SEEMED THAT THE FUGITIVE SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SATISFIED
GEORGE WAS ONLY TWENTY-ONE PASSABLE-LOOKING IN APPEARANCE AND OF A BROWN COLOR AND WHEN SPEAKING STAMMERED CONSIDERABLY
EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE AND ANOTHER WOULD FIND IT HIS TURN TO BE SOLD
THE NAME OF WILLIAM'S OWNER WAS JOHN G

IT WAS THE EVENING BEFORE AT CONGRESS HALL

ARE WE NOT IN CLOSEST LEAGUE AND UNION WITH THOSE WHO CLAIM AND USE THE RIGHT TO BUY AND SELL HUMAN BEINGS GOD'S POOR THE LAMBS OF CHRIST A UNION WHICH WE IMAGINE BRINGS US IN AS MUCH SILVER AND GOLD AS COMPENSATES FOR THE SACRIFICE OF OUR HUMANITY AND MANHOOD
DURING FEEDING TIMES SHE HAD TO ASSIST IN THE HOUSE
PREVIOUS TO COMING INTO THE GOVERNOR'S HANDS WILLIAM WAS HELD AS THE PROPERTY OF MRS MARY JORDON WHO OWNED LARGE NUMBERS OF SLAVES
BUT THE RANCOR AWAKENED IN THE BREAST OF SLAVE-HOLDERS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE HIGH-HANDED STEP THE SON HAD TAKEN BROUGHT THE FATHER UNDER SUSPICION AND HATE
DELAWARE REDEEMED WILL BE PROUD OF HIS MEMORY
BEING A MEMBER OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND PROFESSING TO BE A CHRISTIAN SHE WAS PERSUADED THAT BY INDUSTRY AND ASSISTANCE OF THE LORD A WAY WOULD BE OPENED TO THE SEEKER OF FREEDOM EVEN IN A STRANGE LAND AND AMONG STRANGERS
SAVING MOREOVER TO THE CLAIMANT HIS RIGHT OF ACTION FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF LOSS ETC
UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD STOCK AROSE RAPIDLY AND A FEELING OF UNIVERSAL REJOICING PERVADED THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM FROM ONE END OF THE COUNTRY TO THE OTHER
MY DEAR FRIEND:--I HAVE RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEATH OF YOUR HONORED AND REVERED FATHER WITH PROFOUND EMOTIONS
OBEDIENT TO THESE IMPRESSIONS HE RARELY ERRS IN HIS MINISTRATIONS AND WHETHER HIS ERRAND BE TO REMONSTRATE WITH THE EVIL DOER SETTING HIS SINS CLEARLY AND VIVIDLY BEFORE HIM OR TO STRENGTHEN AND ENCOURAGE SUFFERING INNOCENCE HE IS ALIKE SUCCESSFUL
CONSEQUENTLY THEIR HEARTS WERE THOROUGHLY CEMENTED IN THE HOPE OF REACHING FREEDOM TOGETHER
I DO NOT MEAN TO INSINUATE FOR A MOMENT THAT SUCH THINGS CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN IN MOBILE
THE FIRST NAME ON THE LIST IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT WAS CALLED UP FIRST
IT WAS THEN MOVED THAT IT BE ACCEPTED WITH REGRET THIS WAS CARRIED BY THE SAME VOTE
THE WEATHER HAVE BEEN VERY MILE EVER SINCE THE 23RD OF DEC
HOW COULD YOU MAKE SO MUCH MONEY A
DESCRIBE YOUR FATHER HE WAS CAPTAIN OF A GOVERNMENT VESSEL
THROUGH ANGUISH AND TEARS BLOOD AND DEATH AMERICA WROUGHT OUT HER SALVATION
MY FATHER BURNT LIMESTONE FOR MR LATTA
BEING IN THE HANDS OF HIS MOTHER THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED HIM A LUCKY CHILD
HE WAS EVER WILLING TO SACRIFICE HIS OWN PERSONAL COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE IN ORDER TO ASSIST FUGITIVES
THE MAYOR GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHO HE WAS AND BY WHAT AUTHORITY HE APPEARED ON THE BOAT AND WHAT HE MEANT TO DO
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS NATURAL MODESTY HERE AS ELSEWHERE HE TOOK A CONSPICUOUS POSITION
IN REGARDS TO THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN FROM CANADA TO THE SOUTH THE LETTERS WAS NOT WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEM TO BE AND IF THE SLAVE-HOLDERS KNOW WHEN THEY ARE DOING WELL THEY HAD BETTER KEEP THEIR SIDE FOR IF THEY COMES OVER THIS SIDE OF THE LAKE I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THEY WILL NOT GO BACK WITH SOMETHIN THAT THEIR MOTHER BONED THEM WITH WHETHER THIAR SLAVES WRITTEN FOR THEM OR NOT
OF ALL THE WOMEN WHO SERVED THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE IN ITS DARKEST DAYS THERE IS NOT ONE WHOSE LABORS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE WHOSE CHARACTER IS NOBLER AND WHO IS MORE UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED AND BELOVED THAN LUCRETIA MOTT
OH FOR THAT SPIRIT MEEK AND MILD DERIDED SPURNED YET UNCOMPLAINING BY MAN DESERTED AND REVILED YET FAITHFUL TO ITS TRUST REMAINING

ARRIVAL FROM DUNWOODY COUNTY 1858
TIMES HAVE BEEN VERY PROSPEROUS IN CANADA THIS YEAR
SEARCH WAS MADE FOR HIM BUT IN VAIN
WILLIAM JAMES CONNER HIS WIFE CHILD AND FOUR BROTHERS CAME NEXT
THE OWNER HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HIRE WILLIS OUT FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR WILLIS THOUGHT HIS LOT PRETTY HARD AND HIS MASTER RATHER INCREASED THIS NOTION BY HIS SEVERITY AND ESPECIALLY BY THREATENING TO SELL HIM
THE POOR MAN THAT SECRETED HIMSELF SO LONG MUST INDEED HAVE SUFFERED DREADFULLY AND BEEN EXCEEDINGLY RESOLUTE TO BRAVE DANGERS SO LONG
IT IS PLAINLY TO BE SEEN THAT ELIZABETH HAD NOT MET WITH THE EASE AND KINDNESS WHICH MANY CLAIMED FOR THE SLAVE
I HAVE THE PROMISE THAT THE MERCHANDIZE SHALL BE DELIVERED IN THIS CITY TO-NIGHT
THEREFORE NONE HAD TO DIE AS TRAITORS ON THE MIDDLE PASSAGE IT IS OBVIOUS ENOUGH HOWEVER THAT HER SUCCESS IN GOING INTO MARYLAND AS SHE DID WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HER ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT AND UTTER DISREGARD OF CONSEQUENCES
BROWN ANTHONY AND ALBERT 288
COLOR BROWN AND WAS ENTITLED TO HIS FREEDOM BUT KNEW NOT HOW TO SECURE IT BY LAW SO RESORTED TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD METHOD
REMOVE THE STING OF HATE FROM LAW
PROSTRATION AND SICKNESS HAD ALREADY TAKEN HOLD UPON HIM IN A SERIOUS DEGREE
WE WANTS THAT FELLOW HERE AS JOHN BULL HAS A GREAT DEAL OF FIGHTING TO DO AND AS THERE IS A COLORED CAPTAIN IN THIS CITY I WOULD SEEK TO HAVE THAT FELLOW PROMOTED PROVIDED HE BECAME A SOLDIER
WHILST LEARNING HAS BENT FROM HER LOFTY HEIGHTS TO BOW AT THE LOWLY CROSS
HAD THEY COME THE WHOLE PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN MASSACRED
THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT THEY HAD ACTED WISELY IN TAKING THE HORSES TO ASSIST THEM THE FIRST NIGHT
SAMUEL GREEN
THE RICH AND THE POOR MEET TOGETHER AND THE LORD IS THE FATHER OF THEM ALL MIGHT STAND FOR THE MOTTO OF MR HOPPER'S LIFE
THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO GRASP OUR PLATFORM WITH EAGERNESS AND THE SLAVEHOLDERS BECAME ALARMED TO SEE THEIR WISH TO READ AND DISCUSS ITS SIMPLE TRUTHS
JACOB C
HE FILLED THE SITUATION OF AN ENGINEER
I EXPECT TO LEAVE THE KIRBY HOUSE ON THE 5TH OF MAY
A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A LITTLE BOY OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE ACCOMPANIED ROSE ANNA
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-ONE A BRIGHT SMART PREPOSSESSING YOUNG MAN
I THEN WENT TO THE RAIL ROAD OFFICE AND ASKED FOR A TICKET FOR FREDERICKSBURG
THEIR WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS BOWED DOWN IN PUBLIC LAMENTATION FOR THEIR WARMEST AND MOST STEADFAST FRIEND WAS GONE
HE WAS HOPEFUL NEVERTHELESS
STILL DEAR SIR:--A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDS THE PLEASURE OF ACKNOWLEDGING THE RECEIPT OF LETTERS AND PAPERS
FOR ONE WHO HAD ENJOYED ONLY A FIELD HAND'S PRIVILEGES FOR IMPROVEMENT HE WAS NOT TO BE DESPISED
HE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION THE SPRING WEATHER HAVING BEEN FAVORABLE AND THE JOURNEY MADE WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS DIFFICULTY
HER NAME WAS NANCY JANE AND THE NAME OF THE OFFSPRING WAS ELIZABETH

CATHERINES C.W
SHE WENT IN 1827
IT'S BEST TO HAVE THEM FIT AS WELL AS CAN BE
WE ALL DID OUR PART
HEAR HEAR THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO IN THIS COUNTRY WERE ENLISTED ON THE SIDE OF SLAVERY BY PERSONAL INTEREST WAS ALWAYS COMPARATIVELY FEW
IF IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT SAFE TO COUNSEL AND INSTIGATE OTHERS TO ACTS OF FORCIBLE OPPUGNATION TO THE PROVISIONS OF A STATUTE TO INFLAME THE MINDS OF THE IGNORANT BY APPEALS TO PASSION AND DENUNCIATIONS OF THE LAW AS OPPRESSIVE UNJUST REVOLTING TO THE CONSCIENCE AND NOT BINDING ON THE ACTIONS OF MEN TO REPRESENT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE LAND AS A COMPACT OF INIQUITY WHICH IT WERE MERITORIOUS TO VIOLATE OR SUBVERT THE MISTAKE HAS BEEN A GRIEVOUS ONE
IT WOULD REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF HARD PREACHING TO CONVINCE HIM THAT SUCH CHRISTIANITY WAS OTHER THAN SPURIOUS
HE WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE THEM UP ALTOGETHER
GRACE ANNA NOT MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME DECLARED THAT THE MAN'S FACE OF AGONY IS BEFORE HER NOW
BY THE YOUNG COMPANION OF THE WOMAN
WESLEY'S MISTRESS WAS KIND ENOUGH TO APPRISE HIM OF THE INTENTION OF HIS OWNER AND THE OVERSEER AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD HELP HIMSELF HE HAD BETTER DO SO
IN THOSE DAYS THE WRITER IN GIVING INFORMATION ENJOINED THE UTMOST SECRESY CONSIDERING THAT THE CAUSE MIGHT BE SADLY DAMAGED SIMPLY BY BEING INADVERTENTLY EXPOSED EVEN BY FRIENDS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
AND MAY BARTER MANLY HONOR FOR THE UNION AND FOR GOLD
MARIA WEEMS ESCAPING IN MALE ATTIRE I THINK A SMALL LOT OF HARD COAL MIGHT ALWAYS BE SOLD HERE FROM THE VESSEL AT A PROFIT

BOWEN THE WITNESS WHO BECAME SICK WAS RECALLED
AND FROM A PERPETUAL CURRENT OF NOURISHING BLOOD ONE CANNOT NAME THOSE PARTICULAR ATOMS THAT ARE BUSIEST OR RICHEST TO SUSTAIN VITALITY
HENRY THOS 108
HER CUP HAD BEEN FULL AND VERY BITTER IN BOTH STATES
NEVERTHELESS FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE PRIOR TO 1851 HE WELL KNEW THAT BURRIS WAS AN ACCREDITED AGENT ON THE ROAD ABOVE ALLUDED TO AND THAT HE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A SAFE WISE AND USEFUL MAN IN HIS DAY AND CALLING
I AM ONE OF YOUR CHATTLE
IN THE MEANTIME HIS PARTY MATURED ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR TRIP SO DAVE TOOK OUT AND LEFT THE JUDGES WITHOUT A WAITER
AMONG THE THOUSANDS WHOM WE MET IN OUR PERAMBULATIONS WHO DREAMED OF ANY IMPROPRIETY IN A GENTLEMAN OF CHARACTER AND STANDING LIKE MR MCDONNELL WALKING ARM-IN-ARM WITH A COLORED WOMAN
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THIS YOUNG CHARLESTONIAN HAD RATHER EXALTED NOTIONS IN HIS HEAD
WILLIAM WAS REGULARLY EMPLOYED BY DAY IN HIS MASTER'S TOBACCO FACTORY

THE WIFE'S STATEMENT SHE WAS THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF GOOD PHYSICAL PROPORTIONS AND A PROMISING-LOOKING PERSON ABOVE THE ORDINARY CLASS OF SLAVES BELONGING TO DELAWARE
HE WAS FROM NORTH CAROLINA ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND OF PLEASING APPEARANCE AND WAS HEART AND SOUL IN SYMPATHY WITH THE CAUSE OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
AFFECTIONATELY YOURS JOHN ATKINS
THE LATTER BRANCH OCCUPIED MR HOPPER'S TIME AND ATTENTION AND HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO IT WITH AN AFFECTIONATE AND RELIGIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT CEASED ONLY WITH HIS LIFE
DEAR SIR;--I TAK MY PEN IN HAND TO WRITE TO YOU TO INFORM YOU WHAT WE HAVE HAD TO GO THROW FOR THE LAST TWO WEAKS
THE NATURE THAT WORKS PROCEEDS FROM THE NECESSARY LAWS AND FORCES OF ITS BEING AND IS AS SIMPLE AND UNCONSCIOUS AS ANY OTHER NATURAL LAW OR FORCE
THE PLACE THEY STAYED HERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OFF
I AM IN EARNEST I WILL NOT EQUIVOCATE I WILL NOT EXCUSE I WILL NOT RETRACT A SINGLE INCH AND I WILL BE HEARD CHEERS AND THAT AFTER ALL EXPRESSES TO A GREAT EXTENT THE FUTURE COURSE OF HIS LIFE
SYDNEY HOPKINS AND HENRY WHEELER HAVRE DE GRACE
WILLIAMSON SAMUEL NICKLESS B.N
I FARED DREADFUL BAD UNDER MCCAULLY
WILL YOU ACT FOR HIM AS IF YOU WAS IN SLAVERY YOURSELF AND I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT HE WILL COME OUT OF THAT CONDITION
SHE IS EQUALLY EARNEST IN LABORING FOR EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW--EDUCATION AND A HIGHER MANHOOD ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH AMONG THE FREEDMEN
HIS MANNERS AND MOVEMENTS WERE DECIDEDLY PREPOSSESSING
NOTHING REMARKABLE WAS DISCOVERED IN THEIR STORIES OF SLAVE LIFE
WHEN MY FATHER CAME TO PHILADELPHIA IN 1834 HIS SENTIMENTS IN REGARD TO SLAVERY WERE THOSE HELD GENERALLY IN THE NORTH--AN EASY-GOING WISH TO AVOID DIRECT ISSUE WITH THE SOUTH ON A QUESTION SUPPOSED TO BE PECULIARLY THEIRS
HE EAGERLY SOUGHT HIS PARENTS AND HOME WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED AND PAINS WHEN TO HIS HEART'S JOY HE FOUND HIS RELATIVES

UNDER HIM WE RIDE IN THE CITY CARS AND GET FIRST-CLASS PASSAGE ON THE RAILROAD AT THIS PLACE A COLORED MAN WAS IN PRISON UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH FOR PARTICIPATING IN A RIOT AND THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE DATE OF HER LETTER WAS FIXED FOR HIS EXECUTION

HE LEFT A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN
AND THEN I ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW A MAN LIVING IN D BY THE NAME OF BRADLEY
LETTERS FROM THE ENTERPRISING CHARLOTTE AND HARRIET ARRIVAL NO
IN PONDERING OVER THESE SLIGHT DRAWBACKS TOM CONCLUDED THAT SLAVERY WAS NO PLACE FOR A MAN WHO VALUED HIS FREEDOM IT MATTERED NOT HOW KIND MASTERS OR MISTRESSES MIGHT BE

TORONTO C.W FEB
THE MISTRESS WAS SO QUEER AND HARD TO PLEASE THAT ELIZA BECAME HEARTILY SICK OF TRYING TO PLEASE HER--AN ANGEL WOULD HAVE FAILED WITH SUCH A WOMAN
I SAW HIM IN MARKET STREET BETWEEN THIRD AND FOURTH AT TAYLOR AND PAULDING'S STORE IN THE COURSE OF LAST WEEK
I FEAR THAT HE HAS FALLEN A VICTIM TO THEIR INHUMAN THIRST FOR BLOOD
HE FELT THAT IT WAS ON THE WAY AND WITH THE SERIOUS GRACE THAT MARKED EVERYTHING HE DID HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO GATHER HIS EARTHLY ROBES ABOUT HIM AND PREPARE FOR THE GREAT CHANGE WHICH NO ONE COULD DREAD LESS
STILL:--I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU THAT MRS JACKSON AND HER INTERESTING FAMILY OF SEVEN CHILDREN ARRIVED SAFE AND IN GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS AT MY HOUSE IN ST CATHARINES ON SATURDAY EVENING LAST
BUT COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX THEIR CLAIMS FOR SYMPATHY WERE VERY FAINT INDEED
GEORGE WAS OF AN EXCELLENT FAST DARK COLOR
IT WAS NOT A GREAT WHILE ERE HE WAS ACCOMMODATED AND WAS BROUGHT SAFELY TO PHILADELPHIA
HE CONDESCENDED AT LAST TO APPEAR AND ACCEPTED OUR OFFER TO GO BAIL FOR ALL OF THEM AND FINALLY ISSUED A DISCHARGE
HE SUPPRESSED HIS EMOTION
WHILE HE WAS BY NO MEANS CONSIDERED A HARD MAN HE WOULD NOW AND THEN BUY AND SELL A SLAVE
HENRY LAMINSON DEL
INSTEAD OF SKULKING IN THE WOODS IN THICKETS AND SWAMPS UNDER COVER OF THE DARKNESS HE WOULD BOLDLY APPROACH A HOTEL AND CALL FOR ACCOMMODATIONS AS ANY OTHER SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN
LUKE FIRST MADE HIS WAY TO BALTIMORE AND AFTERWARDS TO PHILADELPHIA
THE USUAL EXAMINATION WAS MADE AND NEEDED HELP GIVEN HIM BY THE COMMITTEE WHO FELT SATISFIED THAT HE WAS A POOR BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN SHAMEFULLY WRONGED AND THAT HE RICHLY DESERVED SYMPATHY
BIGELOW ESQ
BIGELOW ESQ
A QUILT A PILLOW AND A FEW ARTICLES OF RAIMENT WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF FOOD AND A BOTTLE OF WATER WERE PUT IN IT AND LEAR PLACED THEREIN
BROWN HENRY BOX 81

THE WOMAN AND FOUR CHILDREN IN THE WAGON WITH THE DRIVER THE OTHERS WALKING ALL THE WAY
FORTUNATELY THEY WERE FREE THEREFORE HE WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF GETTING THEM
AT LEAST LEAR WAS NEVER INDULGED IN THIS RESPECT
MCHENRY MCCULLOCH
THESE QUERIES THEY ANSWERED IN THEIR OWN WAY WITH INTELLIGENCE
FOR FULL WELL DID HE KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT IN HUMAN NATURE FOR THEM TO ACQUIESCE IN THIS PERILOUS UNDERTAKING THOUGH ONE OF THESE SISTERS MRS SUPPLEE WAS A MOST FAITHFUL ABOLITIONIST
O WHAT WILL THE END BE
TAKE FIVE OF IT FOR THE RESCUERS WHO WERE IN PRISON AND THE REST PAY AWAY ON THE BOOKS
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE OVERSEER AND HIS WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE MISTRESS THAT HER HEALTH WAS REALLY TOO BAD FOR A FIELD HAND AND BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT BE TAKEN WHERE HER DUTIES WOULD BE LESS OPPRESSIVE
A FEW DAYS SINCE I WAS ABOUT TO PAY A WOMAN A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER FOR SOME WASHING IN TEN CENT CURRENCY NOTES WHEN SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT COUNT IT
THE BRUTAL PREJUDICE OF SOME VOTING SAVAGE
NOW MADAM I WISH IT TO BE DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE OUTSET THAT WHATEVER TRANSPIRES BETWEEN US SO FAR AS THIS BUSINESS IS CONCERNED MUST BE KEPT STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BY NO MEANS MUST THIS MATTER BE ALLOWED TO LEAK OUT
IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN TO HAVE THE DIRT OF SLAVERY ALL WASHED OFF
A HORN WAS BLOWN FROM AN UPPER WINDOW
BUT HE COULD NOT CLOSE HIS EYES TO THE FACT THAT AT ONE TIME MRS WHITE HAD BEEN IN POSSESSION OF THIRTY HEAD OF SLAVES ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME HE WAS COUNTING THE COST OF ESCAPING TWO ONLY REMAINED--HIMSELF AND WILLIAM SAVE A LITTLE BOY AND ON HIMSELF A MORTGAGE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WAS THEN RESTING
THAT SYSTEM WHICH MAKES MAN THE PROPERTY OF MAN AND PERPETUATES THAT RELATION FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER
A LIFE CONSISTENT WITH HIS VIEWS WAS A LIFE OF HUMILITY AND UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE AND SUCH WAS HIS
BUT THEY COULD NEITHER RENDER ANY ASSISTANCE NOR THE LIGHT BEING PUT OUT COULD THEY RECOGNIZE THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN IT
HE SAID HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING ABUSED BY THE POPULATION OF HIS OWN COLOR FOR TELLING THAT THIS GIRL RUN AWAY FROM DR PURNELL
ALL LIVED THEN IN TALBOT COUNTY MD
BY RENTING A CHEAP HOUSE I MIGHT HAVE LIVED NOW IT SEEMS STARVATION IS BEFORE ME
WILLIAM HAD BEEN STRIPPED NAKED AND FREQUENTLY AND CRUELLY COWHIDED
SO THEY CONTRIVED EACH TO GET A SUIT OF MOURNING WITH HEAVY BLACK VEILS AND THUS DRESSED APPARENTLY ABSORBED WITH GRIEF WITH A FRIEND TO PASS THEM TO THE BALTIMORE DEPOT HARD PLACE TO PASS EXCEPT AIDED BY AN INDIVIDUAL WELL KNOWN TO THE R.R
I COULD HAVE TORN DOWN ALL THE TELEGRAPH WIRES IN THE LAND

YOU HAVE NEVER SUFFERED FROM BEING ABSENT FROM A WIFE AS I HAVE
THAT WE ENDANGER THE RIGHT THEY CLAIM TO TREAT HUMAN BEINGS AS BEASTS OF BURDEN
HE THEN ASKED ME IF HE MIGHT SEARCH THE HOUSE
HE WAS WELL CARED FOR IMMEDIATELY
THEY MAY THINK IT SAFER TO WALK TO THE CITY THAN TO GO IN THE CARS BUT FOR FEAR OF ACCIDENT IT MAY BE BEST TO HAVE SOME ONE AT THE CARS TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM
SHE THEREFORE TALKED STRONGLY OF SELLING HIM

GREEN MODOCK ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE WAS OWNED BY WILLIAM DORSEY PERRY BY ROBERT DADE SAM AND ISAAC BY THOMAS OWINGS ALL FARMERS AND ALL TOUGH AND PRETTY MEAN MEN SAM AND ISAAC HAD OTHER NAMES WITH THEM BUT NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF CLOTHING AS THEIR MASTER MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED
FROM HIS EXPERIENCE ROBERT DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT HIS MASTER WAS MEAN A VERY HARD MAN WHO WOULD WORK HIS SERVANTS EARLY AND LATE WITHOUT ALLOWING THEM FOOD AND CLOTHING SUFFICIENT TO SHIELD THEM FROM THE COLD AND HUNGER
IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON CONTENDING FOR HIS RIGHTS
OH IS IT NOT A PRIVILEGE IF YOU ARE SISTERLESS AND LONELY TO BE A SISTER TO THE HUMAN RACE AND TO PLACE YOUR HEART WHERE IT MAY THROB CLOSE TO DOWN-TRODDEN HUMANITY ON ANOTHER OCCASION IN WRITING FROM THE LECTURING FIELD HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM PHILADELPHIA THE SYMPATHY SHE FELT FOR THE FUGITIVES FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE
IT WAS THE FIRST OF MY UNITING WITH THE CHURCH
THERE IS MUCH TO DO HER
BUT AS TO EXPATRIATION THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT IS FOOLISH
YOURS THOS
I NEVER MADE IT ANY BETTER OR WORSE BUT AIMED STRAIGHT FOR THE DOOR
DURING HIS ENTIRE MANHOOD MAJOR HAD BEEN BRUTALLY TREATED BY HIS MASTER WHICH CAUSED HIM A GREAT DEAL OF ANGUISH AND TROUBLE OF MIND
HE WAS SHREWD ENOUGH TO FIND AN AGENT WHO GAVE HIM PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS AND TO WHOM HE INDICATED A DESIRE TO TRAVEL NORTH ON SAID ROAD
HE HAD THEREFORE POSSESSED VERY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VARIED OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO THE TRADER'S CONDUCT IN HIS NEFARIOUS BUSINESS AS WELL AS FOR WITNESSING THE EFFECTS OF THE AUCTION-BLOCK UPON ALL AGES--RENDING ASUNDER THE DEAREST TIES DESPITE THE PITEOUS WAILS OF CHILDHOOD OR WOMANHOOD PARENTAL OR CONJUGAL RELATIONS

MY OBJECT IN COMING TO THE OFFICE IS SIMPLY TO NOTIFY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SO THAT THEY MAY BE ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR THEM AT THE DEPOT THIS EVENING AND GET THEM OUT OF DANGER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BY HIS BAD HABITS HE HAD RUN THROUGH WITH HIS PROPERTY THOUGH IN SOCIETY HE STOOD PRETTY TOLERABLY HIGH AMONGST SOME PEOPLE
THIS IS PARTLY OWING TO THE FACT THAT DURING THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF OUR CONNECTION WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD SO LITTLE WAS WRITTEN OUT IN THE WAY OF NARRATIVES THAT WOULD HARDLY BE OF SUFFICIENT INTEREST TO PUBLISH

A LANDLESS PEOPLE MUST BE DEPENDENT UPON THE LANDED PEOPLE
SUMMONING COURAGE HE STARTED BY THE BALTIMORE AND WILMINGTON RAIL ROAD
THERE IS NOT A COLORED MAN OR WOMAN IN THE WHOLE LAND WHO WILL NOT WANT TO POSSESS IT
UP TO THE TIME OF HER DEATH HE HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE FREE INDEED HE WAS ASSURED BY HER DYING TESTIMONY THAT THE SLAVES WERE NOT TO BE SOLD BUT REGARDLESS OF THE PROMISES AND WILL OF HIS DEPARTED WIFE MUIR SOON EXTINGUISHED ALL HOPES OF FREEDOM FROM THAT QUARTER
HARRISON WAS ALSO MOVED BY ANOTHER CONSIDERATION
THE CHANGE WROUGHT IN HIM THEN CAN BEST BE GATHERED FROM HIS OWN SIMPLE WORDS UNDER DATE 1842 WRITTEN IN A FLY-LEAF OF THE UNITARIAN MISCELLANY THOUGH I HUMBLY TRUST THAT GOD MADE MY TRIALS IN 1836 THE MEANS OF BRINGING ME TO TRUE REPENTANCE YET I HAVE KEPT THESE BOOKS AS MONUMENTS OF WHAT I ONCE WAS AND TO REMIND ME HOW GRATEFUL I SHOULD BE TO HIM FOR HAVING SNATCHED ME AS A BRAND FROM THE BURNING SUCH A FAITH AS THIS BORN OF THE SPIRITUAL TRAVAIL OF YEARS WHAT A LIFE IT ALWAYS HAS FOR THE HEART THAT FORMS IT

WITHOUT CLAIMING FOR HIM A POSITION ABOVE HUMANITY WHICH ALONE WOULD ACCOUNT FOR A WILLINGNESS TO BE WHOLLY UNRECOGNIZED AS A FRIEND OF THE AFFLICTED IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT NO MAN WAS EVER LESS DESIROUS OF PUBLIC PRAISE OR OUTWARD HONOR
POOR CHILD
I HAVE COMMENCED SINCE I READ SOLOMON NORTHRUP
I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TWICE SINCE HE WAS HERE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DIRECTIONS BUT NEVER RECEIVED AN ANSWER
NOT ONLY DID ESTHER MOORE MANIFEST SUCH MARKED INTEREST IN THE FUGITIVE BUT SHE LIKEWISE TOOK AN ABIDING INTEREST IN VISITING THE COLORED PEOPLE IN THEIR RELIGIOUS MEETINGS SCHOOLS AND SOCIETIES AND WHENEVER THE WAY OPENED AND THE SPIRIT MOVED HER SHE WOULD TAKE OCCASION TO ADDRESS THEM IN THE MOST AFFECTIONATE MANNER IN REGARD TO THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE WELFARE CHOOSING FOR HER THEME THE SUBJECTS OF TEMPERANCE EDUCATION AND SLAVERY
IN THE PRESENT CASE THEY ACTED NOBLY WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THEIR GENERAL CHARACTER OF WHICH I KNOW NOTHING
THEY DOOMED HIM TO THE SLOW MARTYRDOM OF SOCIAL SCORN
THE PENNINGTONS HOWEVER ALTHOUGH PAINS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO APPRIZE THE DOCTOR OF THE GOOD NEWS OF THE COMING OF HIS KIN WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS WERE CAPTURED AFTER BEING IN NEW YORK SOME TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
THEY WERE BOTH GLAD TO SEE HIM
IF THEY HAD GONE ACCORDING TO LAW I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIRED OUT OR SOLD BUT MY MISTRESS WANTED TO KEEP ME TO CARRY ON THE PLACE FOR HER SUPPORT
BOOKS AND PAPERS WERE SENT AWAY FOR A LONG TIME AND DURING THIS TIME THE RECORDS WERE KEPT SIMPLY ON LOOSE SLIPS OF PAPER
BUT YOU DO NOT MOURN WITHOUT HOPE FOR YOU HAVE AN ASSURANCE IN HIS DEATH THAT YOUR LOSS IS HIS INFINITE GAIN
HOW CAN WE BE THANKFUL ENOUGH IF IT SHOULD AND SOON TOO

ONE BOY ON THE PLACE ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS FREE BUT HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM ARKANSAS
HE HAD BEEN KNOCKED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL A SHORT WHILE BEFORE HE FLED HE STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN BEAT BRUTALLY SO MUCH SO THAT THE IDEA OF ESCAPE WAS BEAT INTO HIM
BARNABY GRIGBY ALIAS JOHN BOYER AND MARY ELIZABETH HIS WIFE FRANK WANZER ALIAS ROBERT SCOTT EMILY FOSTER ALIAS ANN WOOD
THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING IN RICHMOND WITH HIS WIFE HAD BEEN DENIED HIM THUS FEARING TO RENDER HER UNHAPPY HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONCEAL FROM HER HIS INTENTION TO ESCAPE
SIR I ALWAYS FOUND IN AMERICA THAT A SHOWER OF BRICKBATS HAD A REMARKABLY TONIC EFFECT MATERIALLY STRENGTHENING TO THE BACK-BONE
MY HEART ALMOST BLEEDS WHEN I THINK OF IT
THE SAILORS WHO WERE ENGLISHMEN WERE VERY SORRY TO HEAR OF THE TREATMENT WE HAD RECEIVED AND COUNSELLED US HOW WE MIGHT GET FREE THE COUNSEL WAS HEEDED AND IN DUE TIME THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN LIVERPOOL

HE REJOICES OVER THE ARRIVAL OF HIS WIFE_--_BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS HEART IS BLEEDING OVER A DEAR FRIEND WHOM HE HAD PROMISED TO HELP BEFORE HE LEFT SLAVERY
BESIDES THE STRUGGLES ALREADY ALLUDED TO SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND
BARNABY WAS OWNED BY WILLIAM ROGERS A FARMER WHO WAS CONSIDERED A MODERATE SLAVEHOLDER ALTHOUGH OF LATE ADDICTED TO INTEMPERANCE HE WAS THE OWNER OF ABOUT ONE DOZEN HEAD OF SLAVES AND HAD BESIDES A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
WITH THE STRONGEST DESIRE TO MAKE THE PORT OF CANADA SAFELY HE HAD RESOLVED TO BE CARRIED BACK IF ATTACKED BY THE SLAVE HUNTERS ONLY AS A DEAD MAN HE WAS HELD TO SERVICE BY JOHN MUIR A WEALTHY FARMER AND THE OWNER OF 40 OR 50 SLAVES
ALFRED HOWEVER GAVE A FULL DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER'S CHARACTER AND THE MOTIVES WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO SEEK HIS FREEDOM
JOSEPH WAS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE OF UNMIXED BLOOD ORDINARY SIZE AND HAD A COMMENDABLE SHARE OF COURAGE AND INTELLECT
ONE WEEK HAD ELAPSED FROM THE TIME HE SET OUT UNTIL HIS ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA
ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MURDEROUS CONFLICTS HE COULD NOT FORGET THAT HE HAD BEEN SOLD ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
THE TREATMENT THAT HAD BEEN METED OUT TO THEM WAS ABOUT AS TOLERANT AS SLAVERY COULD WELL AFFORD
IT MAY ALSO BE SEEN THAT HE WAS FULLY ALIVE TO THE NECESSITY OF PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES
PLEAS LET US HEAR FROM YOU BY ANY MEANS
FOUR YEARS AGO HIS WIFE WAS SOLD AWAY TO GEORGIA BY HER YOUNG MASTER
IT WAS FAVORABLY RECEIVED BY MR GARRISON AND OTHERS BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN UPON IT AT THAT TIME

JOHN STATED THAT DAVID HENRY HOUSTON A FARMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HIM
PURNELL JOHN 528
THAT HE HAS BEEN USED TO TIGHT WORK ALLOWED NO CHANCES AND BUT HALF FED HIS REASON FOR LEAVING WAS PARTLY HARD TREATMENT AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE COULD GET ALONG BETTER IN FREEDOM THAN IN SLAVERY HE FOUND FAULT WITH HIS MASTER FOR NOT PERMITTING HIM TO LEARN TO READ ETC
AS ONE THAT LOVES YOUR SOUL REPENT YE THEREFORE AND BE CONVERTED THAT YOUR SINS MAY BE BLOTTED OUT WHEN THE TIME OF REFRESHING SHALL COME FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD
SHE WAS VERY QUARRELSOME ALTHOUGH A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH JACKSON SEEING THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS YEARLY GROWING HARDER AND HARDER CONCLUDED TO TRY AND BETTER HIS CONDITION IF POSSIBLE HAVING A FREE WIFE IN THE NORTH WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMMUNICATING WITH HIM HE WAS KEPT FULLY AWAKE TO THE LOVE OF FREEDOM
HIS WIFE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF A WOMAN AS HE WAS A MAN
ALFRED IS TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE IN STATURE QUITE SMALL FULL BLACK AND BEARS THE MARKS OF ILL USAGE
BUT WITH MARTYR-LIKE FAITH SHE ENDURED TO THE END AND WAS EVENTUALLY SAVED FROM THE HELL OF SLAVERY
BEFORE ESCAPING HE FELT AFRAID TO LEAD HIS COMPANION INTO THE SECRET OF HIS CONTEMPLATED MOVEMENTS AS HE FELT THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY FOR HIM TO DO ANYTHING FOR HER DELIVERANCE
BUT WITH MRS HILL TOUCHING THIS POINT HE WAS THOROUGHLY DISSATISFIED
FROM A BOY HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT
DO I NOT OWE YOU ON THE OLD BILL PLEDGE
HE WAS HELD TO SERVICE BY MRS MARY HURLEY
HE SAID THAT THE GENERAL PROFESSED TO OWN HIM
BEFORE STARTING ON THEIR JOURNEY THEY FELT THE NEED OF NEW NAMES AND IN PUTTING THEIR WITS TOGETHER THEY SOON FIXED THIS MATTER BY DECIDING TO PASS IN FUTURE BY THE FOLLOWING NAMES
THAT IN CROSSING THEY WOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THE LAND THEY WELL UNDERSTOOD

NO DOUBT THEY ARE ALL IN COMPANY TOGETHER
NINTH LETTER
I HAVE LECTURED SEVERAL NIGHTS THIS WEEK AND THE WEATHER IS QUITE WARM
YOU MAY JUDGE WHAT A MEETING THERE WAS WITH THEM AND MAY GOD GRANT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME MORE MEETINGS WITH OUR WIVES AND FRIENDS
WELL SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER I DO NOT LIKE CANADA OR THE PROVINCES
THINGS I BELIEVE ARE A LITTLE MORE HOPEFUL
WELL SAYS THE GENTLEMAN IT IS LIKE THE CASE OF A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE BUT IT IS NOT AND IF IT WERE IT WOULD NOT BENEFIT HIS CASE
FREQUENTLY HAVE SUCH PASSENGERS BEEN THOROUGHLY CLEANSED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION
AT THE AGE OF TWENTY HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD RUN AWAY IF IT COST HIM HIS LIFE
I WISH YOU WOULD WRITE ME ANOTHER LONG LETTER IN DETAIL OF INTERESTING FUGITIVES ETC SUCH AS YOU WROTE LAST WINTER AND I WILL HAVE IT READ BEFORE THE CIRCLE
SUBSEQUENTLY HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF ONE OF THE JUDGE'S SISTERS MRS JOHN TYLER WIFE OF EX-PRESIDENT TYLER AND THEN HE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S DOMESTIC HOUSEHOLD WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT FROM 1841 TO 1845

THAT WILL NOT GET THEM OUT OF SLAVERY SUCH WAS THE ADVICE OFTEN GIVEN TO THE FUGITIVE
SIR MR

HE COULD SEE NO FAIR PLAY IN IT
HER VOICE WAS REMARKABLE--AS SWEET AS ANY WOMAN'S VOICE WE EVER HEARD AND SO CLEAR AND DISTINCT AS TO PASS EVERY SYLLABLE TO THE MOST DISTANT EAR IN THE HOUSE
THE WAY THAT THEY WERE TO TRAVEL AND THE VARIOUS POINTS OF DANGER TO BE PASSED ON THE ROAD WERE FULLY CONSIDERED
THE WOMAN AND CHILDREN WERE ASSISTED BUT NOT FORCED TO LEAVE
JOHN WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF UNMIXED BLOOD AND OF A QUIET DEMEANOUR
I STILL REMAIN YOUR FRIEND

SHE WAS ABOUT AN ORDINARY SIZE NOT THE SMALLEST SIZE NOR THE LARGEST
YOU WERE DENOUNCED PERSECUTED AND HUNTED DOWN BY MOBS OF WEALTHY MEN ALARMED FOR THE INTERESTS OF THEIR CLASS
AND EVEN YET I CANNOT BUT EXCLAIM WHEN I THINK OF IT--O FATHER
ESPECIALLY WERE SLAVE-HOLDERS TAUGHT THE WHOLESOME LESSON THAT THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW WAS NO GUARANTEE AGAINST RED HOT SHOT NOR THE CHARGES OF U.S

HENCE THE CALL FOR THIS MEETING
IT WILL KILL HER
THEY OUGHT TO ARRIVE BETWEEN 11 AND 12 O'CLOCK
A SMALL PARTY OF ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS WAS ACCORDINGLY FORMED TO ACCOMPANY THE FUGITIVES THROUGH THE EXHIBITION
THE OTHER MUST BE FOUND IN THE FACT MENTIONED,--THAT NEITHER RESOLVE NOR IMPULSE WAS THEIR SPUR BUT PERSONAL CHARACTER MOVING FROM ITS DEPTHS
THE SIZE OF THE BOX AND HOW IT WAS TO BE MADE TO FIT HIM MOST COMFORTABLY WAS OF HIS OWN ORDERING
MANY SUCH STORIES WERE SOUNDED IN THE EARS OF SLAVES BUT WITHOUT MUCH EFFECT
THEY WERE THOROUGHLY SOAKED IF NOTHING MORE
CORDELIA LONEY SLAVE OF MRS JOSEPH CAHELL WIDOW OF THE LATE HON
WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HEAR OF THE GOOD BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF ACTING ON THE BORDERS AS UPRIGHT MEN AND CHRISTIANS

OLIVER WILLIAM 514
I SHALL LEAD IF YOU WILL FOLLOW WE WILL WAS THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
WHEELER AND MR WILLIAMSON WERE DEBATING THE QUESTION RELATIVE TO THE ACTION OF THE COMMITTEE AND AT THAT INSTANT JANE AND HER TWO BOYS WERE INVITED INTO IT AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE WRITER WHO PROCURED IT WERE DRIVEN DOWN TOWN AND ON TENTH STREET BELOW LOMBARD THE INMATES WERE INVITED OUT OF IT AND THE SAID CONDUCTOR PAID THE DRIVER AND DISCHARGED HIM
HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY INQUISITIVE
HIS DESIRE TO ESCAPE BROUGHT THE THOUGHT HOME TO HIS MIND WITH GREAT EMPHASIS THAT HE WAS PARTING WITH HIS KINSFOLK TO SEE THEM PERHAPS NO MORE ON EARTH
WITH ANTHONY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED JUST AS EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING THE MOST HOPELESS WORD CAME TO HIM IN HIS PLACE OF CONCEALMENT THAT A FRIEND NAMED MINKINS EMPLOYED ON THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND WOULD UNDERTAKE TO CONCEAL HIM ON THE BOAT IF HE COULD BE CROWDED IN A CERTAIN PLACE WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY SPOT THAT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SAFE
IT CONTAINS ABOUT 700 LINES BEGINNING WITH BLANK VERSE OF THE COMMON MEASURE AND CHANGING TO OTHER MEASURES BUT ALWAYS WITHOUT RHYME
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM PUT IN A SMALL BOX AND THE OVERCOAT I LEFT AT YOUR HOUSE TO BE PUT IN THE BOX WITH THEM TO BE SENT TO THE CARE OF MY FRIEND HIRAM WILSON
AS TO HIS FITNESS FOR MAKING A GOOD CITIZEN IN CANADA THE COMMITTEE HAD NO DOUBT
BUT THE DREAD OF SLAVERY WAS STRONG IN THE MINDS OF THESE FUGITIVES AND THEY VERY FULLY REALIZED THEIR FOLLY IN STOPPING IN NEW JERSEY
CLANDESTINELY MEETING TOGETHER AT THE TAVERN AND THAT TO CONSULT IN REGARD TO THE IDENTITY OF A PERSON ABOUT WHOM THEY KNOW NOTHING
HE BECAME VERY SEVERE
I HOPE THEY HAVE STARTED ON TO ME
LEVIN HOLDEN LAUREL

IN 1865 THE LAST VOLUME WAS ISSUED MR GARRISON HAVING ALREADY IN MAY WITHDRAWN FROM THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO FOUND IN 1833 AND OF WHICH AS HE DREW UP THE DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS HE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING OF THE ORIGINAL AIMS AND PROPER DURATION

CAMPBELL A NEGRO TRADER LIVING IN BALTIMORE AND THENCE TO CAMPBELL'S BROTHER ANOTHER TRADER IN NEW ORLEANS AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO DANIEL MCBEANS AND MR HENRY OF HARRISON COUNTY MISSISSIPPI
FROM HERE SHE WAS FORWARDED TO CANADA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE COMMITTEE
THE LATTER IS NOT HOWEVER AS IN PAST TIMES FROM THE NEWCASTLE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY FOR I AM SORRY TO SAY IT IS NOT A SUFFICIENTLY PAINS-TAKING AND EXECUTIVE LITTLE BODY BUT MORE APT TO WORK BY FITS AND STARTS BUT FROM OUR PRIVATE FRIENDS WHO KINDLY PLACE THEIR MONEY IN OUR HANDS AS THEIR ANTI-SLAVERY STEWARDS
I NEVER SAW A GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE IN A NIGGER FROM SIXTEEN TO THIRTY-FIVE OR FORTY SOMETIMES THEY GROW FATTER AND SOMETIMES LEANER
THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY REQUESTS HIM TO COMPILE AND PUBLISH HIS PERSONAL REMINISCENCES AND EXPERIENCES RELATING TO THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD HON

IN THE LETTER ABOVE REFERRED TO SHE SAID
BE KIND ENOUGH TO INFORM ME WHETHER SUSAN IS WITH YOU AND IF SHE IS GIVE HER THE PROPER DIRECTION
HE WAS A LARGE PORTLY MAN AND ABLE TO WORK FOR HIMSELF IN PERRY'S OPINION
IT IS TRUE THAT ENGLAND HOWEVER THE ENGLISHMAN IS OUR BEST FRIEND BUT WE AS MEN OUGHT NOT TO DEPENED UPON HER REMONSTRACE WITH THE AMERICANS BECAUSE SHE LOVES HER COMMERCIAL TRADE AS ANY NATIONS DO
HE CAME FROM MIDDLE NECK CECIL COUNTY WHERE HE HAD SERVED UNDER WILLIAM FLINTHAM A FARMER
HE WILL RETURN HERE IN A WEEK OR TWO TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE
SEEING THAT THEY HAD BEEN DUPED THEY BECAME VERY ANGRY AND PROCEEDED FORTHWITH TO SEARCH THE HOUSE AND ALL THE OUTHOUSES IMMEDIATELY AROUND IT WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING THOSE WHOM THEY SOUGHT
ONE OR MORE SLAVES BELONGING TO OTHER OWNERS IT IS SUPPOSED WENT IN THEIR COMPANY
CYRUS DISLIKED THIS TALK EXCEEDINGLY BUT HE SAID NOTHING TO THE WHITE PEOPLE TOUCHING THE MATTER

SUNDRY ARRIVALS IN 1859
SUNDRY ARRIVALS IN 1859
JAMES HENSON WAS A MAN OF RATHER SLENDER BUILD
IN THIS DEN THEY STAYED THREE MONTHS
SOME OF THEM AWAKEN AN INDIGNATION A HORROR OR A SENSE OF HUMILIATION AND SHAME THAT MAKES THE BLOOD CURDLE OR THE CHEEK FLUSH OR THE BREATHING DIFFICULT
AT A LATE HOUR OF THE NIGHT AFTER GOING FROM THE ALDERMAN'S BOARDINGHOUSE TO A FIRE ENGINE HOUSE AND OTHER PLACES WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE MIGHT PROBABLY BE FOUND ON GOING A THIRD TIME TO HIS HOTEL A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE WAS DISCOVERED TO BE IN BED AND IT WAS THEN ASCERTAINED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN OUT ALL THE EVENING
THEY ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO HEAR FROM HER AS THEY HAVE FAILED OF MEETING WITH HER ON THE WAY OR FINDING HER HERE IN ADVANCE OF THEM
IN THAT LOCALITY HE WAS WELL KNOWN UNFORTUNATELY TOO WELL KNOWN FOR HE HAD BEEN RAISED PARTLY THERE AND AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF HIS RELATIVES AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE STILL LIVING THERE
MY WIFE AND CHILDREN DEARER TO ME THAN MY HEART'S BLOOD WERE THEY MADE FOR THE AUCTION-BLOCK
HOW JAMES GOT OFF AND WHERE HE WENT VERENEA KNEW QUITE WELL
IF THE SENTIMENTS IN THE ABOVE LETTER DO NOT INDICATE AN UNCOMMON DEGREE OF NATURAL INTELLIGENCE A CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE WRONGS OF SLAVERY AND A JUST APPRECIATION OF FREEDOM WHERE SHALL WE LOOK FOR THE SIGNS OF INTELLECT AND MANHOOD
THE PRISONER IS THEREFORE DISCHARGED
HE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF FIVE CHILDREN OF WILLIAM AND MARGARET SHIPLEY HIS FATHER HAVING EMIGRATED FROM UTTOXETER IN STAFFORDSHIRE ENGLAND ABOUT THE YEAR 1750
THEREFORE THEY WERE ADVISED TO GO TO HEADQUARTERS DIRECTLY TO BOSTON
I HEARD HER SAY HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DEAD AND THAT THEY LIVED SOMEWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
WHEN HE DID PARTLY RECOVER HE WAS SET TO WORK AGAIN WE CEASED TO RECORD ANYTHING FURTHER CONCERNING RICHMOND ALTHOUGH NOT A FOURTH PART OF WHAT HARRY NARRATED WAS PUT UPON PAPER
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE FUGITIVE
THERE HE WAS HAPPY FOUND EMPLOYMENT AND WANTED FOR NOTHING BUT HIS WIFE AND CLOTHING LEFT IN VIRGINIA
I GOT THE MONEY THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN I CAME WITH IT HE SAID HE COULD NOT LEAVE UNLESS HIS FAMILY WAS TAKEN CARE OF
DURING JOE'S SOJOURN UNDER THE CARE OF THE COMMITTEE TIME WOULD NOT ADMIT OF THE WRITING OUT OF FURTHER DETAILS CONCERNING HIM
I INSTANTLY INQUIRED OF ONE OF THE COLORED PERSONS FOR THE DESIRED DESCRIPTION AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS A TALL DARK WOMAN WITH TWO LITTLE BOYS MR W

JOHN CLAYTON THE COMPANION IN TRIBULATION OF WILLIAM AND JAMES MUST NOT BE LOST SIGHT OF ANY LONGER
THE SECOND TIME HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH SQUIRREL SHOT BY THE SHERIFF WHO WAS ATTEMPTING TO ARREST HIM FOR HAVING RESISTED THREE YOUNG WHITE RUFFIANS WHO WISHED TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEATING HIM BUT GOT BEATEN THEMSELVES
HE HOWEVER FELT THAT WHILE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM TO LOOK TO FOR SUPPORT SHE WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT SYMPATHY AS SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH
THAT THEY HAD THERE BEEN HELD TO SERVICE OR SLAVERY BY SARAH ANN BURGESS AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HOUSTON FROM WHOM THEY FLED
HERE RIPENED A FRIENDSHIP WHICH AFTERWARD BECAME OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE FOR ALTHOUGH A NATURE SO POSITIVE AS THAT OF THADDEUS STEVENS COULD SCARCELY BE SAID TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANY OTHER MIND STILL IF THERE WERE THOSE WHO EXERCISED A MORAL SWAY SUSTAINING THIS COURAGEOUS REPUBLICAN LEADER AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HE MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ATTAINED ELIJAH F

PERRY ANNA 437
THE MAN HUNTERS SOON CAME UP AND THE CONSTABLE ASKED ME TO GET THE KNIFE FROM THE FUGITIVE
IN A SECOND WE WERE IN THEIR PRESENCE
I SHALL HOWEVER KNOW BEFORE I MAIL THIS NOTE
HE HAD BEEN ASKING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HER
ABOUT THE 30TH OF MARCH IN THE YEAR 1859 A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE WAS NOTIFIED BY A COLORED SERVANT LIVING AT A FASHIONABLE BOARDING-HOUSE ON CHESTNUT STREET THAT A LADY WITH A SLAVE WOMAN FROM FREDERICKSBURG VA WAS BOARDING AT SAID HOUSE AND THAT SAID SLAVE WOMAN DESIRED TO RECEIVE COUNSEL AND AID FROM THE COMMITTEE AS SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO SECURE HER FREEDOM BEFORE HER MISTRESS RETURNED TO THE SOUTH
AND TOOK THE POSITION THAT HE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD BE TO THE INTEREST OF THE INSTITUTION TO PARDON HIM
WHILST THERE ARE A SCORE OF OTHER INTERESTING LETTERS BEARING ON THIS CASE THE ABOVE MUST SUFFICE TO GIVE AT LEAST AN IDEA OF THE PERPLEXITIES AND DANGERS ATTENDING ITS EARLY HISTORY
I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT SHARE THE SAME FATE
IF THERE HAVE BEEN ALLOW ME TO BEG TEN THOUSAND PARDON BEFORE GOD AND MAN FOR I AM NOT DESIGN TO THROW ANY OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHOM I LEFT IN SOUTH BUT TO AIDE THEM IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
HERE THE DIFFICULTIES AT LEAST VERY MANY OF THEM VANISH YET IN ONE RESPECT THE DANGER BECAME MOST IMMINENT
BURTON HANDY 495
BUT I SHALL TELEGRAPH BACK THAT I WILL BE ON THE LOOK-OUT WHILE THE OFFICER WAS GIVING THIS INFORMATION HE WAS LISTENED TO MOST ATTENTIVELY AND EVERY WORD HE UTTERED WAS CAREFULLY WEIGHED
YOU WILL HAVE LEARNED THE SAD INTELLIGENCE THAT MY PRINTING-OFFICE HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY A BRUTAL MOB OF PRO-SLAVERY MEN
UNLESS YOU DO MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH SOME PERSON AND ASSURE THEM THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THE FUNS FOR DELIVERING THE PARCEL THIS BUSINESS CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED
THE CHRISTIANITY OF THIS AGE OUGHT TO BE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE CHRISTIANITY OF CALVIN
BEING DIRECTED TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE FOR INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE BEST PLAN TO ADOPT TO FIND OUT THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS PARENTS FORTUNATELY HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF HIS OWN BROTHER THE WRITER WHOM HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE MUCH LESS SEEN OR KNOWN
AT A MEETING OF OUR SOCIETY TO-DAY AT WHICH YOUR LETTER WAS READ IT WAS THOUGHT BEST THAT I SHOULD REPLY TO IT A REQUEST WITH WHICH I CHEERFULLY COMPLY
HE WAS HURRIEDLY INTERVIEWED FOR THE SAKE OF RELIABLE INFORMATION
DEAR SIR:--I TAKE THIS METHOD OF INFORMING YOU THAT I AM WELL AND THAT I GOT TO THIS CITY ALL SAFE AND SOUND THOUGH I DID NOT GET HERE AS SOON AS I EXPECT
BIRNEY IN THAT YEAR THROUGHOUT THE UNION
JIM HAD A SINGLE-BARRELLED PISTOL AND COUNTED ON BLOWING A MAN DOWN IF ANY ONE TOUCHED HIM
MY DEAR SIR:--SUSAN BELL LEFT HERE YESTERDAY WITH THE CHILD OF HER RELATIVE AND SINCE LEAVING I HAVE THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU HAD NOT THE ADDRESS OF THE GENTLEMAN IN SYRACUSE WHERE THE CHILD IS TO BE TAKEN FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT ETC
REBECCA CLOSELY WATCHED THE COURSE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS AND IN THE MEANWHILE FIRMLY RESOLVED THAT NEITHER SHE NOR HER CHILDREN SHOULD EVER SERVE ANOTHER MASTER
I FOREWARN ALL MASTERS OF VESSELS FROM HARBORING OR EMPLOYING THE SAID SLAVE
INFERIOR IN SHORT IN EVERYTHING THAT CONSTITUTES THE WEALTH THE HONOR THE DIGNITY THE STABILITY THE HAPPINESS THE TRUE GREATNESS OF A NATION,--IT IS WRONG IT IS UNJUST IT IS ABSURD THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT SO ENTIRELY DISPROPORTIONATE TO OUR OWN
HOW DOES IT HELP US TO APPRECIATE HIS TRIALS AND THE GODLIKE SPIRIT WITH WHICH HE BORE THEM THE DARK WINTER OF 1860 BROKE GLOOMILY OVER ALL ABOLITIONISTS
WHATEVER COURSE ANY MEMBERS MAY HAVE TAKEN IN RELATION TO THIS MATTER I MUST BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE ACTED FROM WHAT HAS SEEMED TO THEM A SENSE OF DUTY
THE WOMAN WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY IF IT HAD GONE OUT
SOME OF THEM MAY DIFFER FROM THE MASS AS TO THE RIGHTFULNESS OR THE WISDOM OF THIS OR THE OTHER PROVISION THAT IS FOUND IN THE FEDERAL COMPACT THEY MAY BE DIVIDED IN SENTIMENT AS TO THE POLICY OF A PARTICULAR STATUTE OR OF SOME PROVISION IN A STATUTE

TO GIVE SOME IDEA OF THE COURSE PURSUED BY DANIEL AND HANNAH GIBBONS I INSERT THE FOLLOWING LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF EVENTS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 1821
BROWN AND THE CRAFTS HAVE PAID SEVERAL OTHER VISITS TO THE GREAT EXHIBITION IN ONE OF WHICH WM
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW ME
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
THE SUBJECT OF THIS SKETCH WAS ONE OF TWO HUNDRED SLAVES OWNED BY BOLLING ELLIS WHO POSSESSED LARGE PLANTATIONS AT CABIN POINT SURREY CO VA
THE IDEA OF BEING CAPTURED BY SLAVE-HUNTERS OR SLAVE-HOLDERS SEEMED NEVER TO ENTER HER MIND
A SHORT EXTRACT WILL SHOW ITS TONE
ORIGINAL AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS WHO MET THE SCORN AND ODIUM THE IMPUTED SHAME AND OBLOQUY THE FROWNS AND COLD-SHOULDERS WHICH THEY BORE THROUGH ALL THE DARK DAYS OF SLAVERY NOW SEE AND FEEL THEIR REWARD IN SOME MEASURE
MUCH SYMPATHY GIVEN TO THE ABUSED SLAVE OWNER
THE PLACE BECAME HATEFUL TO HIM
IN THE MEANWHILE HIS INTEREST IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM DID NOT FALTER
THE CAPTAIN HAD TWO OR THREE OTHER UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MALE PASSENGERS TO BRING WITH HIM BESIDES SAM FOR WHOM ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MADE--NO MORE COULD BE BROUGHT THAT TRIP
THE IMMEDIATE HEIRS CONSISTED OF SIX SONS AND FIVE DAUGHTERS WHO MOVED IN THE FIRST CIRCLE WERE VERY WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC ABE WAS CONVERSANT WITH THE FACT THAT HIS MASTER THE HON
FOR IT WAS JUST THIS KIND OF HEROIC AND SELF-SACRIFICING STRUGGLE THAT APPEALED TO THE HEARTS OF MEN AND COMPELLED ATTENTION
SAFE BACK IN THE HANDS OF HER OWNER TO PREVENT HER FROM ESCAPING A SECOND TIME EVERY NIGHT FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS SHE WAS CAUTIOUSLY KEPT LOCKED UP IN THE GARRET UNTIL AS THEY SUPPOSED SHE WAS FULLY CURED OF THE DESIRE TO DO SO AGAIN BUT SHE WAS INCURABLE
WE WENT INTO BLOODGOOD'S HOTEL
STILL:--AS I MUST AGAIN SEND YOU A LETTER FEALING MYSELF OBLIDGE TO YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE AND YOUR KINDNESS
DOUBTLESS HIS EXCITED MASTER THOUGHT SAM A GREAT THIEF TO TAKE HIMSELF AWAY IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID BUT SAM WAS NOT CONCERNED ON THIS POINT
I HAVE SINCE THEN SEEN THE RAINBOW-CROWNED NIAGARA CHANTING THE CHORAL HYMN OF OMNIPOTENCE GIRDLED WITH GRANDEUR AND ROBED WITH GLORY
THE ARM OF THE WOMAN BEING SLIGHTLY TOUCHED ACCOMPANIED WITH THE WORD COME SHE INSTANTLY AROSE
THE FIVE YEARS HAD MORE THAN EXPIRED BUT NO HOPE OR SIGN OF FREEDOM APPEARED
SURELY THE EVERLASTING ARMS THAT HAVE HUSHED HIM SO STRANGELY TO SLEEP ARE ABLE TO GUIDE THE NATION THROUGH ITS UNTROD FUTURE
I LIKE GENERAL SICKLES AS A MILITARY GOVERNOR
VOID OF INTENTIONAL OFFENCE TO GOD OR MAN HIS SPIRIT HAS JOINED ITS HAPPY KINDRED IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS NEITHER SORROW NOR PERPLEXITY I SENT THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATION TO THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE
THEY HAVE HAD SOME OF THEM A TERRIBLY HARD TIME IN SLAVERY AND THEIR SUBJECTION HAS NOT CEASED IN FREEDOM
2 THE PILOTS LICENSED UNDER THE LAWS OF VIRGINIA AND WHILE ATTACHED TO A VESSEL REGULARLY EMPLOYED AS A PILOT BOAT ARE HEREBY CONSTITUTED INSPECTORS TO EXECUTE THIS ACT SO FAR AS THE SAME MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY AND THE WATERS TRIBUTARY THERETO WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS STATE TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER INSPECTORS AS MAY BE APPOINTED BY VIRTUE OF THIS ACT
WE WOULD HAVE YOU SAY TO THE SOUTH,--IF YOU CHOOSE TO HUG TO YOUR BOSOM THAT SYSTEM WHICH IS CONTINUALLY INJURING AND IMPOVERISHING YOU
A WHISPER POINTED HIM TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND TOLD HIM TO BE FEARLESS AND TAKE THE FIRST TRAIN
THE CAPT
HE HAD HEARD ENOUGH OF THE CRUELTIES OF SLAVERY IN THESE REGIONS TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IF HE SHOULD BE CAUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO SYMPATHY OR MERCY SHOWN
AND IF NOW AND THEN A VOICE FROM THE NORTH BLEW DOWN WARNINGLY AS A TRUMPET THE GREAT CITY TURNED SLUGGISHLY IN HER BED OF SPIRITUAL AND POLITICAL TORPOR AND CRIED
HIS WIFE WAS LOOKING ON SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED CRYING TO HIM TO LAY ON
SHE ASSISTED IN ORGANIZING A SABBATH-SCHOOL AND ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION

I HAVE THOUGHT OF THE WORD BITTERNESS AS EXPRESSING IT
A LETTER FROM MY FRIEND BROWN
INSTEAD OF THAT HOWEVER THE CASE WAS HEARD AT ONCE NO PERSONS BEING PRESENT WHEN THE CLAIMNANTS TESTIFIED THAT THEY WERE THE OWNERS OF SAID SLAVES AND THAT THEY ESCAPED FROM THEIR SERVICE AT BALTIMORE ON SUNDAY LAST
HE MADE NO GRAVE COMPLAINTS OF ILL-USAGE UNDER HIS MASTER JOSEPH REYNOLDS WHO LIVED AT NEWTON PORTSMOUTH VA
HE AT ONCE DETERMINED TO REPAIR THITHER IN PERSON AND OBTAIN THEM
HENRY C
HENRY C
BETWEEN TWO AND THREE YEARS BEFORE ESCAPING THEY WERE SOLD FROM MARYLAND TO JOHN B
HE WENT NOT HOWEVER TO LEARNED LAWYERS OR ABLE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL IN HIS DISTRESS AND TROUBLE BUT WENDED HIS WAY DIRECTLY TO THE WOODS WHERE HE FELT THAT HE WOULD BE SAFER WITH THE WILD ANIMALS AND REPTILES IN SOLITUDE THAN WITH THE BARBAROUS CIVILIZATION THAT EXISTED IN PORTSMOUTH
IT WAS LIGHT BUT QUITE WOOLLY
TO SAY THAT HE WAS LIKE A BIRD OUT OF A CAGE CONVEYS IN NO SENSE WHATEVER THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF HIS DELIGHT IN ESCAPING FROM THE PRISON HOUSE
THEY HAD BEEN OWNED BY JOHN PEAK BY WHOM ACCORDING TO THEIR REPORT THEY HAD BEEN BADLY TREATED AND THE COMMITTEE HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT THEIR TESTIMONY
HE TOLD THE SIMPLE TRUTH TO EACH WITH EQUAL FRANKNESS
WILLIAM CARNEY AND ANDREW ALLEN
MERCY TRUTH AND JUSTICE SHUDDERED BUT YOUR HANDS WOULD GIVE NO AID
LEST YOU MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED IT I WRITE YOU AGAIN THOUGH BRIEFLY
THE REASON THAT WE SEND THIS NOTE WE ARE AFRAID THE OUTHER ONE WOUDENT GO STRAIT BECAUSE IT WASENT DERECTED WRIGHT
RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--THINE OF YESTERDAY CAME TO HAND THIS MORNING ADVISING ME TO FORWARD THOSE FOUR MEN TO THEE WHICH I PROPOSE TO SEND FROM HERE IN THE STEAM BOAT AT TWO O'CLOCK P.M
I HAVE BEEN TO ST JOHN N.B LOWER PROVINCE OR LOWER CANADA ALSO ST CATHARINES C.W AND ALL AROUND THE CANADA SIDE AND I DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL
SITUATED AS THAT CITY IS UPON THE VERY EDGE OF SLAVERY AND SOCIALLY BOUND AS IT WAS BY TIES OF BLOOD OR AFFINITY WITH THE SLAVE-HOLDERS OF THE SOUTH TO ALL HUMAN FORESIGHT IT WOULD ASSUREDLY BE THE FIRST THEATRE OF BLOODSHED IN THE COMING DEADLY STRUGGLE
IT IS AN ACT OF INSURRECTION WE MIGHT CONSIDERING THE PECULIAR CLASS AND CONDITION OF THE GUILTY PARTIES ALMOST CALL IT A SERVILE INSURRECTION--IF NOT ALSO ONE OF TREASON
THOMAS PAGE
WILLIAM WRIGHT LOOKED EARNESTLY AT THEM AND TOLD THEM TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND GET THEIR COATS
THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS INDIVIDUAL WERE SO ADMIRABLY PORTRAYED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND OTHER PERIODICALS PUBLISHED AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH THAT WE SHALL MAKE FREE USE OF THEM WITHOUT HESITATION
LLOYD HACKET ALIAS PERRY WATKINS AND WILLIAM HENRY JOHNSON ALIAS JOHN WESLEY
WILL YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS WITH SOME EXPLICITNESS AND WITHOUT DELAY
I HAVE TOLD ALL YOU SAID IN YOURS THAT MR MINKINS WOULD BE IN YOUR CITY VERY SOON AND YOU WOULD SEE WHAT YOU COULD DO FOR ME DO YOU MEAN OR DO SPEAK IN REFERENCE TO MY DEAR UNCLE
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL DRAWBACKS THE CAUSE WAS GATHERING STRENGTH AND MR GARRISON FOUND HIMSELF BY AND BY SURROUNDED BY A SMALL BUT INCREASING BAND OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE DEVOTED TO THIS CAUSE AS HE HIMSELF WAS
TWO OF THEM HAD SHARED THE SAME DEN AND CAVE IN THE WOODS AND HAD BEEN SHOT CAPTURED AND CONFINED IN THE SAME PRISON
HERE IS IGNORANCE TO BE INSTRUCTED

NEW YORK MAY 25TH

HARD TREATMENT HAD BEEN HER LOT
ASBURY IRWIN EPHRAIM ENNIS AND LYDIA ANN JOHNS
A DARLING BOY
SHE LITERALLY WEPT WITH THOSE WHO WEPT WHILE IN TONES OF PECULIAR LOVE SINCERITY AND FIRMNESS SHE LAUDED THEM FOR THEIR NOBLE DARING AND FREELY EXPRESSED HER ENTIRE SYMPATHY WITH THEM AND LIKEWISE WITH ALL IN THE PRISON-HOUSE
I ASKED THE MAN IF HE HAD PRESENTED THE LETTER TO EITHER OF THE OTHERS TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED
WHITE PEOPLE BEING SO ACCUSTOMED TO RIDING AND COLORED PEOPLE TO DRIVING THE PARTY LOOKED ALL RIGHT
IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE KEPT ANY LONGER
YOU WILL SEE IN IT THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH POLITICS HERE
THEE NEED NOT ADVANCE HIM ANY FUNDS
AFTER THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE FREEMAN WITH THE STANDARD IN 1854 HE BECAME THE OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE LATTER PAPER HIS LETTERS SERVING TO SOME EXTENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE DISCONTINUED FREEMAN
IN HIS RESOLUTE ATTEMPT HE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT ANY VERY SEVERE SUFFERING
IT IS ONE TOO FOR WHICH WE OUGHT NOT TO BE DEPENDENT ON TRADITION
CATHARINE C.W SEPT
THE CONSTABLE ASKED ME IF THEY WERE IN MY HOUSE
THAT SHE IS WELL AND LIVING IN ST CATHARINE C.W NEAR NIAGARA PALLS
JACK WHO WAS NOT OF THE MCLANE PARTY BUT WHO CAME WITH THEM HAD BEEN KEPT IN IGNORANCE WITH REGARD TO HIS AGE
BY LAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR MORE
HE WAITED BUT A LITTLE WHILE ERE HE WAS ON THE ROAD UNDER DIFFICULTIES IT IS TRUE BUT HE ARRIVED SAFELY AND WAS JOYFULLY RECEIVED
THE MEREST GLANCE AT WHAT HE EXPERIENCED DURING HIS BRIEF STAY ON THE PLANTATION MUST SUFFICE
I THINK THOU WOULDST RECEIVE A LITTLE LETTER FROM ME A DAY OR TWO AFTER THINE WAS WRITTEN THROUGH OUR FRIEND SAML
$50 REWARD WILL BE PAID IF TAKEN WITHIN THIRTY MILES OF ALEXANDRIA OR IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AND $150 AND NECESSARY EXPENSES IF TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE AND SECURED SO THAT I GET HIM AGAIN
SHE HAD NEVER LIVED WITH HIM HOWEVER
GEORGE WAS TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE QUITE DARK MEDIUM SIZE AND BORE THE MARKS OF A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE PLUCK
BROWN LOUISA 135
ACCORDINGLY HE LEFT AND FOUND ANOTHER PLACE OF SECLUSION--WITH A FRIEND IN THE TOWN--FOR A PECUNIARY CONSIDERATION
SHE WAS NOT MARRIED WHEN I FIRST SAW HER IN 1827
HIS OWNER WAS A TOBACCO MANUFACTURER WHO HELD SOME THIRTY SLAVES IN HIS OWN RIGHT BESIDES HIRING A GREAT MANY OTHERS
TO THIS LATTER CLASS OF FRIENDS IT SEEMS MEET THAT WE SHOULD PARTICULARLY ALLUDE
THE MOTHER IS ABOUT TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE GOOD-LOOKING AND OF CHESTNUT COLOR SMART AND BRAVE
WHEN HE ARRIVED HERE HE FOUND THE MAN HAD LEFT
THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE CONTROLLED BY FALSE SYMPATHIES AND SOME WHO YIELD TOO READILY AND TOO FULLY TO SYMPATHIES NOT ALWAYS FALSE OR IF FALSE YET PARDONABLE AND BECOME CRIMINAL BY YIELDING THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY IN OUR JAILS AND ALMSHOUSES BUT SEGREGATED HERE AND THERE IN DETACHED PORTIONS OF THE STATE IGNORANT MEN MANY OF THEM WITHOUT POLITICAL RIGHTS DEGRADED IN SOCIAL POSITION AND INSTINCTIVE OF REVOLT ALL THIS IS TRUE
HE HAD SOME BREAD IN HIS POCKET WHICH HE HAD INTENDED FOR SUBSISTENCE UNTIL HE COULD REACH A LAND OF LIBERTY

THEY BELONGED TO THE CLASS OF WELL-CARED FOR SLAVES

ALL BEING FIRST-CLASS WAITERS AND UNDERSTANDING CATERING THEY DECIDED TO OPEN A LARGE DINING-SALOON
BRINTON DARLINGTON THEN SHERIFF OF CHESTER COUNTY AND VERY MANY OF THE LEADING MEN TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN THE MATTER
THE CLOTHING NOT RECOLLECTED
FINDING HIM TO BE HUMANE AND GENEROUS-HEARTED--SHOWING KINDNESS TOWARD ALL ESPECIALLY IN BUYING BREAD C FOR THE STARVING PRISONERS AND BY A TIMELY NOTE OF WARNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF ONE OF THE KEEPERS FOR WHOSE DESTRUCTION A BOLD PLOT HAD BEEN ARRANGED--THE OFFICERS FELT DISPOSED TO SHOW HIM SUCH FAVORS AS THE LAW WOULD ALLOW
GIVE MY BEST RESPECTS TO YOUR FAMILY AND ALSO TO DR L MR WARRICK MR CAMP AND FAMILYS TO MR FISHER MR TAYLOR TO ALL FRIENDS NAMES TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION
EXCEPT JOHN BROWN IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER HIS RIVAL COULD BE FOUND WITH RESPECT TO BOLDNESS DISINTERESTEDNESS AND WILLINGNESS TO BE SACRIFICED FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF THE OPPRESSED
SOLOMON GEO 79

WILSON SARAH C 168
AFTER CONVERSING A FEW MOMENTS AT THE BARN WILLIAM WRIGHT BROUGHT THE SLAVE-HOLDERS DOWN TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS ENGAGED THEM IN A CONTROVERSY ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY WHICH LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR
ARRIVED BY ADAMS EXPRESS
OWING TO THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND ABOUT A YEAR PREVIOUS TO HER ESCAPE SHE HAD SUFFERED GREATLY SO MUCH SO THAT ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS SHE HAD FALLEN INTO ALARMING FITS,--A FACT BY NO MEANS AGREEABLE TO HER OWNER AS HE FEARED THAT THE TRADERS ON LEARNING HER FAILING HEALTH WOULD UNDERRATE HER ON THIS ACCOUNT
THE ACTIVE PART WHICH THOMAS SHIPLEY TOOK IN ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENTS DID NOT DIMINISH HIS INTEREST IN THE PROSPERITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE OLD PENNSYLVANIA SOCIETY
SO AM I
I AT ONCE SHOT HIM WITH MY PISTOL BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS THROWING UP HIS ARM WHICH HIT MINE AS I FIRED THE EFFECT OF THE LOAD OF MY PISTOL WAS MUCH TURNED ASIDE
HE HAD TOILED UNDER JOHN BURNHAM IN DORCHESTER COUNTY FROM WHOM HE HAD RECEIVED HARD TREATMENT BUT HARDER STILL FROM HIS MISTRESS
I LIKES THIS CITY VERY WELL AND I AM IN HOPES THAT THERE A LIVING HERE FOR ME AS MUCH SO AS THERE FOR ANY ONE ELSE
HE SAID A NIGGER AND A MULE HADN'T ANY FEELING HE DESCRIBED HIS STATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES SOMEWHAT THUS
THE FATHER WAS ABOUT TO BE TORN FROM HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN
HAVING DWELT ON THE SAD NARRATIVES OF SAMUEL GREEN AND HIS SON IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER IT IS QUITE A RELIEF TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE A TRAVELER WHOSE STORY CONTAINS INCIDENTS LESS PAINFUL TO CONTEMPLATE
HE PROPOSED THAT A WRIT OF CERTIORARI WHICH WOULD OBLIGE THE JUDGE TO REMOVE THE CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT AND A HABEAS CORPUS FROM THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE STATE SHOULD BOTH BE IN READINESS WHEN THE DECISION OF THE JUDGE SHOULD BE PRONOUNCED IN CASE THAT IF IT SHOULD BE UNFAVORABLE THE WRITS MIGHT BE AT ONCE SERVED AND THE PRISONER REMANDED TO THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY TO BE BROUGHT UP BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AT TRENTON FOR ANOTHER TRIAL
ON ARRIVING THE WARM HEARTS OF ABOLITIONISTS WELCOMED THEM HEARTILY AND GREETED AND CHEERED THEM WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE
THERE IS ABUNDANT ROOM THEREFORE FOR CULTIVATION OF COTTON BY THE EMANCIPATED FREEHOLDERS
A VESSEL WAS BEING LOADED WITH SHINGLES THE CAPTAIN OF WHICH WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ALLOW MILES TO OCCUPY A VERY SECURE HIDING-PLACE THEREON
TAKING ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INTO CONSIDERATION RESPECTING THE COURAGEOUS CAREER OF THIS SUCCESSFUL ADVENTURER FOR FREEDOM HIS CASE IS BY FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANY I HAVE YET REFERRED TO
WRITE ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHERE AND TO WHOM WE SHOULD SEND THE FUNDS WHEN RAISED
YET IT IS ONLY ONE FACT OUT OF MANY THAT MIGHT BE ADDUCED AND I HAVE BROUGHT IT FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS IN MY FATHER'S WORDS A FAIR EXPONENT OF THE POSITION OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT THAT TIME UPON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY HENCEFORWARD HE CEASED NOT TO RAIN BLOWS NOT ONLY AT HIS OWN THE PRESBYTERIAN DENOMINATION BUT AT ALL THE ORGANIZED EXPRESSIONS OF CHRISTIAN PURPOSE,--THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL UNION THE TRACT SOCIETY ETC
NO ONE COULD TELL WHAT HAD BECOME OF JACK NO MORE THAN IF HE HAD VANISHED LIKE A GHOST
FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS THE GREATER PART OF JIM'S TIME WAS OCCUPIED IN TRYING TO ESCAPE AND IN BEING IN PRISON FOR SALE TO PUNISH HIM FOR RUNNING AWAY
NEVERTHELESS THE EXAMINER'S REPORT WAS PRESERVED WITH OTHER RECORDS AND IS HERE GIVEN FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH
MR GARRETT THEN HIRED THE CARRIAGE BUT GAVE THE DRIVER DISTINCTLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE ONLY PAID FOR THE WOMAN AND THE YOUNG CHILDREN
TO THE BLACK RACE AND ESPECIALLY THAT PART OF IT ONCE SLAVE IT IS MORE THAN A HISTORY OF A TIME OF PERIL
A STRUGGLE THROUGH EPOCHS OF DOUBT AND DISMAY INTO AN ATTITUDE OF POSITIVE VITAL FAITH
WITNESSES--JOANNA DIAMOND JOHN H
I HEARD OF IT ABOUT THAT TIME
ROBERT WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN AND FROM LONG AND DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE SLAVE PRISON HE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS AS A PENNSYLVANIA FARMER WITH HIS BARN-YARD STOCK

MITCHELL 300
IT IS OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO A MOST SERIOUS MISTAKE
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO BUT HE WAS AFRAID AS SLAVE-HOLDERS WERE ALWAYS MAKING THE SLAVES BELIEVE THAT IF THEY SHOULD EVER ESCAPE THEY WOULD CATCH THEM AND BRING THEM BACK AND SELL THEM DOWN SOUTH CERTAIN
IT WAS THIS SAID GEORGE
WHILE IT MAY NOT NOW DO ZACHARIAH BERRY MUCH GOOD TO LEARN THIS SECRET IT MAY NEVERTHELESS BE OF SOME INTEREST TO THOSE WHO WERE OF NEAR KIN TO JIM TO GLEAN EVEN SO SMALL A RAY OF LIGHT
AND WE CAN HELP TO FEED AND RELIEVE AND LIBERATE THEM BY GIVING OUR HEARTY SYMPATHY TO THE BLESSED CAUSE OF THEIR EMANCIPATION TO THE ABOLITION OF THE CRYING INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THEY ARE TREATED BY UTTERING OUR EARNEST PROTEST AGAINST THE INCREASING AND FLAGRANT OUTRAGES OF THE OPPRESSOR BY WITHHOLDING ALL AID AND COUNTENANCE FROM THE WORK OF OPPRESSION TO SAY THAT DR FURNESS IN HIS PLEADINGS FOR THE SLAVE WAS INSTANT IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON IS NOT TO EXAGGERATE

HE HAD ALREADY AS HE THOUGHT BEEN DEALT WITH VERY WRONGFULLY BY PUSEY WHO HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF MANY YEARS OF THE BEST PART OF HIS LIFE AND WOULD CONTINUE THUS TO WRONG HIM IF HE DID NOT MAKE A RESOLUTE EFFORT TO GET AWAY
SLAVERY AND ITS MYSTERIOUS INNER LIFE HAS NEVER YET BEEN DESCRIBED
THEY ROWED WITH A GREATER WILL THAN EVER AND LANDED ON A SMALL ISLAND
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE CHILDREN OF SUCH PARENTS GROWING UP UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A MOTHER NEEDED NO CONVERSION NO SACRIFICES OF PREJUDICE OR HOSTILE OPINIONS TO MAKE THEM ANTI-SLAVERY
CAMMINGS IN THOSE DAYS PUBLISHER OF THE EVENING BULLETIN FOR THE FIRST TIME WITNESSED AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD ARRIVAL
THERE IS BUT 4 SLAVES NEAR US NEVER SPOKE TO ONE OF THEM BUT WONCE SHE NEVER GOS OUT PLEAS TO TRI AND HELP YOU CAN DO MUCH IF YOU WILL IT WILL BE THE MEANS OF SAVING OURSELVES AND OTHERS
FOR NOT LIKE THINE IS CRUCIFIED THE SPIRIT OF OUR HUMAN PRIDE
HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT THIS PREJUDICE WAS AKIN TO SLAVERY AND GAVE TO SLAVERY ITS CHIEF SUPPORT
THE ANGUISH THE TERROR THE AGONY INFLICTED BY THIS INFAMOUS STATUTE MUST BE WITNESSED TO BE FULLY APPRECIATED
MONTREAL SEPTEMBER 1ST 1859
AN ARDENT MEMBER OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY AND AN ACTIVE OFFICER OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD COMPANY HE MADE HIS BOOK AS A BUSINESS MAN MAKES HIS LEDGER VIZ
MY FATHER'S NAME WAS SAM GRAFF MY MOTHER'S NAME WAS BECKY RUTH ANN DORSEY ISAAC HANSON AND TWO BROTHERS OF EVAN GRAFTON AND ALLEN ACCOMPANIED HIM IN HIS FLIGHT
WHY SAID HE I MUST HAVE ONE OF THEM IN MY SCHOOL HE TOOK ME TO A CLASS WHERE I FOUND ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TO WHOM I GAVE THE NEEDFUL INFORMATION
SHE THEN WENT TO BED AND THERE REMAINED ALL DAY SPEAKING BUT A VERY LITTLE DURING THAT TIME
THEY FLED FROM MIDDLETOWN DELAWARE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN OWNED BY ANDREW PETERSON
SOMETIMES THE HARDNESS OF THE ROAD MADE THEM FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE UP THE JOURNEY WHETHER OR NOT
EDWARDS DAVID 526
HE WAS AWARE TOO THAT HE WAS THE REPUTED SON OF A WHITE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A PROFESSIONAL DENTIST BY THE NAME OF DR PETER CARDS
THE HEAVY BONDS OF SLAVERY MADE HIM MISERABLE
SENNETT JULY 31ST 1856
THAT WAS ALL HE SAID AT THAT TIME ONLY WE TURNED INTO A HOTEL AND HE SAID DON'T BREATHE THIS TO ANYBODY
THERE ARE THOSE WHO FIVE YEARS SINCE WERE ASHAMED MUST I SAY IT TO BEAR THE APPELLATION OF ANTI-SLAVERY WHO CAN NOW MANFULLY BEAR THE ONE THEN STILL MORE REPELLANT OF ABOLITIONIST
HIS LABORS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND ARE SUCH AS ARE RECORDED UPON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE
HUGHES DANIEL 73
IN MEMORANDA FURNISHED BY HER TO ELIZABETH CADY STANTON SHE SAYS
HE WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT A FEELING OF SOME SATISFACTION THAT HIS OLD MASTER IN GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS STEWARDSHIP AT THE BAR OF THE JUST ONE WOULD BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT OF HIS INDEBTEDNESS TO THOSE WHOM HE HAD OPPRESSED
THEY HAD PREACHED LONG AND LOUDLY ABOUT THE CONTENTED AND HAPPY CONDITION OF THE SLAVES,--THAT THE CHIEF END OF THE BLACK MAN WAS TO WORSHIP AND SERVE THE WHITE MAN WITH JOY AND DELIGHT WITH MORE WILLINGNESS AND OBEDIENCE INDEED THAN HE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO SERVE HIS MAKER
IT WAS NECESSARY HOWEVER IN THOSE DAYS THAT THEY SHOULD SEEK A PERMANENT RESIDENCE WHERE THEIR FREEDOM WOULD BE MORE SECURE THAN IN PHILADELPHIA
WAS SUBJECTED TO THE SEVEREST TRIAL OF HIS DEVOTION TO FREEDOM HIS NOBLE BEARING THROUGHOUT WON FOR HIM THE ADMIRATION AND SYMPATHY OF THE FRIENDS OF HUMANITY AND LIBERTY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LAND AND IN PROOF OF HIS FIDELITY HE MOST CHEERFULLY SUBMITTED TO IMPRISONMENT RATHER THAN DESERT HIS PRINCIPLES
YOU HAVE NEVER GIVEN ME HIS NAME NOR AM I ANXIOUS TO KNOW IT
WE WANT TO SEND OUR MONEY WHEREVER IT IS MOST NEEDED TO HELP THE DESTITUTE OR THOSE IN DANGER AND WHERE IT WILL BE FAITHFULLY APPLIED
HE RESOLVED TO SPARE NO PAINS TO GIVE HIMSELF NO REST UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH FREE
SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HELP IN HER SYMPATHY AND LABORS FOR THE POOR FUGITIVES AND I SHOULD THINK THERE ARE MANY THERE WHO WOULD WILLINGLY ASSIST HER
PLEASE TO LET ME KNOW WHEN THE ROAD ARRIVED WITH ANOTHER CARGO
FOR SOME OTHERS I AM GLAD
INDEED HENRIETTA HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A SERVANT TO PLEASE HER MISTRESS IT MATTERED NOT HOW HARD SHE MIGHT TRY
HAVING WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY HE MANAGED TO REACH HIGEE HOTEL A VERY LARGE HOUSE WITHOUT A CELLAR ERECTED ON PILLARS THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
I ADVISED DORSEY TO LEAVE BUT HE VERY POINTEDLY REFUSED SAYING HE HAD BEEN TAKEN UP ONCE BEFORE ALIVE BUT NEVER WOULD BE AGAIN
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD BEST STRIKE OUT UPON A VENTURE IN A NORTHERN DIRECTION AND DO THE BEST HE COULD TO GET AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE FROM THE IMPENDING DANGER THREATENED BY MR WALLACE
HE WAS OWNED BY A MAN NAMED JOHN LEWIS WHO ALSO OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY HEAD OF SLAVES WHOM HE KEPT ON FARMS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SASSAFRAS RIVER IN SUSSEX COUNTY
PERHAPS THE MASTER THOUGHT THE FAMILY LIKENESS WAS RATHER TOO DISCERNIBLE
LET THE REFLECTING MIND PAUSE IN THE HONORABLE CONTRAST AS A PUBLIC SPEAKER THOMAS SHIPLEY WAS CLEAR COGENT SOMETIMES ELOQUENT AND ALWAYS IMPRESSIVE
HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY
FRANIE WHOM ROBERT CHARGED WITH VARIOUS OFFENCES OF A SERIOUS DOMESTIC CHARACTER
WHETHER THEY EVER HEARD WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE RUNAWAY GEORGE IS NOT KNOWN
WE COULD HAVE HAD LOCATIONS MORE FERTILE AND MORE EASY OF ACCESS BUT MORE EXPOSED TO THE SLAVE-POWER
MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE ALIKE SHARERS IN THE COMMON STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM--WERE ALIKE AN HUNGERED IN PRISON NAKED AND SICK BUT IT WAS A FEARFUL THING IN THOSE DAYS FOR EVEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO WHISPER THEIR SAD LAMENTATIONS IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA EXCEPT TO THOSE FRIENDLY TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HARRIET SHEPHARD AND HER FIVE CHILDREN WITH FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS
HARRIET SHEPHARD AND HER FIVE CHILDREN WITH FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS
WHEREUPON HE GAVE THE FOLLOWING GRAPHIC SPECIMEN
ITS PROCESS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT GIVES REAL RIGHT TO ULTIMATE PEACE
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOW PRICE OF COTTON THE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY MUCH AND I AM GIVING ALL MY LECTURES FREE
CONSEQUENTLY BEING ABLE TO PACK THE FUGITIVES AWAY IN A VERY PRIVATE HOLE OF HIS BOAT AND BEING ONLY BOUND FOR A SOUTHERN PORT THE CAPTAIN WAS WILLING TO RISK HIS SHARE OF THE DANGER
MORE THAN A CENTURY HAS PASSED AWAY
WITH THE ABOVE THREE ARRIVALS ON HAND IT MAY BE SEEN HOW GREAT WAS THE DANGER TO WHICH ALL CONCERNED WERE EXPOSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE BOLD AND OPEN MANNER IN WHICH THESE PARTIES HAD ESCAPED FROM THE LAND OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION
GLANDING BOTH CLAIMANTS BEING RESIDENTS OF MARYLAND
WE SPOKE AMONG EACH OTHER OF THE WRONGS OF SLAVERY
FOR YOU WILL AND YOU MUST SUCCEED IF YOU HAVE A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE
ON SEVENTH DAY EVENING I SAW A COLORED WOMAN FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE WAS A SINGLE MAN AND FOLLOWED FARMING
THE NEXT PASSENGER WAS MOSES OR MOSE WHO LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN EXCEEDINGLY WELL-CARED FOR BEING PLUMP FAT AND EXTRA-SMART
THIS WAS CERTAINLY A CHARITABLE VIEW
SOME HAVE NONE--OF THE LATTER ONE CAN RAISE $50 ANOTHER SAY 30 OR 40 DOLLARS--ANOTHER WHO WAS GAZETTED LAST AUGUST A COPY SENT YOU CAN RAISE THROUGH HER FRIENDS 20 OR 30 DOLLARS C C
SOON THESE THINGS BROUGHT SERIOUS REFLECTIONS TO SHERIDAN'S MIND AND AMONG OTHER QUESTIONS HE BEGAN TO PONDER HOW HE COULD GET A TICKET ON THE U.G.R.R AND GET OUT OF THIS PLACE OF TORMENT TO WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN LABOR
HIS FATHER'S EXAMPLE WAS EVER PRESENT TO ENCOURAGE HIM FOR HE HAD ESCAPED WHEN HENRY WAS A LITTLE BOY
EIGHT YEARS THIS SLAVE'S DUTIES HAD BEEN AT THE SLAVE PRISON AND AMONG OTHER DAILY OFFICES HE HAD TO ATTEND TO WAS TO LOCK UP THE PRISON PREPARE THE SLAVES FOR SALE ETC
I CAN READ
AT THE OLD PRICE FIVE DOLLARS PER POUND HE WAS WORTH SOMETHING FAT AS HE WAS
CAN THEY REFER TO ANY MARKS BY WHICH TO IDENTIFY THIS PERSON
RING OUT

THIS ARTICLE WAS DOING UNREQUITED LABOR AS THE SLAVE OF THOMAS WALLACE IN PRINCE GEORGE COUNTY MARYLAND
HANNAH DELLUM AND HER CHILD WERE RETURNED TO SLAVERY FROM PHILADELPHIA
AT ANY RATE SHE DECIDED THAT SHE COULD NOT RECEIVE HIM BACK AGAIN
WHILE HE WAS THEN TOO YOUNG TO HAVE RETAINED HER FEATURES IN HIS MEMORY THE FACT HAD ALWAYS BEEN A PAINFUL ONE TO REFLECT UPON
26TH 1855
IN A VERY EXCITED MANNER HE HURRIEDLY APPROACHED CHARLOTTE AND HARRIET WHO WERE APPARENTLY WEEPING
ARRIVED JOSEPH HALL JR SON OF JOSEPH HALL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA THIS IS ALL THAT IS RECORDED OF THIS PASSENGER YET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS ITEM OF NEWS MAY LEAD TO THE RECOGNITION OF JOSEPH SHOULD HE STILL HAPPEN TO BE OF THE LARGE MULTITUDE OF FUGITIVES SCATTERED OVER THE LAND AMONGST THE LIVING
JIM BELLE $100 REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON SATURDAY NIGHT NEGRO MAN JIM BELLE
JIM BOWLEGS ALIAS BILL PAUL
BUT ALAS BEFORE THE FEW DAYS HAD EXPIRED THE SUBJOINED BRIEF PARAGRAPH OF NEWS WAS DISCOVERED IN THE MORNING LEDGER
BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE SPOT BEHOLD
AGAIN HE WAS CAPTURED AND RETURNED TO HIS OWNERS
THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HOWEVER HAD NOT WON THEIR FREEDOM THUS FAR WITHOUT GREAT SUFFERING FROM THE LONG AND FATIGUING DISTANCE WHICH THEY WERE OBLIGED TO WALK
AT ALL EVENTS IT WAS THROUGH CRUEL TREATMENT HAVING BEEN FREQUENTLY BEATEN AFTER SHE HAD PASSED HER EIGHTEENTH YEAR THAT SHE WAS PROMPTED TO SEEK FREEDOM
DORSEY ANNA 319
NEAR CAMBRIDGE MD
BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME THAT HE MUST EITHER BE FAITHLESS TO DUTY IN THE CAUSE OF HIS ENSLAVED BRETHREN OR PART COMPANY WITH THE SOCIETY TO WHICH HE WAS BOUND BY THE STRONG AND SACRED TIES OF EARLY RELIGIOUS FEELING THIS SACRIFICE HE ALSO CALMLY LAID ON THE ALTAR OF HUMANITY
BUT IT OCCURRED TO THEM THAT ELLEN WAS BEARDLESS
HE HAD WORKED MORE OR LESS AT THE FOLLOWING TRADES
ABOUT THE 4TH OF JULY 1856 A MESSAGE REACHED THE SECRETARY THAT A SCHOONER CONTAINING FIFTEEN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS FROM NORFOLK VIRGINIA WOULD BE LANDED NEAR LEAGUE ISLAND DIRECTLY AT THE FOOT OF BROAD STREET THAT EVENING AT A LATE HOUR AND A REQUEST ACCOMPANIED THE MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ON HAND TO RECEIVE THEM
SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF MR BIGLOW HAS HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HER HUSBAND
AUNT HANNAH MOORE IN 1854 IN COMPANY WITH HER SO-CALLED MISTRESS MARY MOORE AUNT HANNAH ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA FROM MISSOURI BEING EN ROUTE TO CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE WITH HER MISTRESS WAS TO JOIN HER MASTER WHO HAD GONE THERE YEARS BEFORE TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
MR PEIRCE ESPECIALLY WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST ABLEST AND MOST FAITHFUL LAWYERS TO THE SLAVE OF THE PHILADELPHIA BAR
HE OWNED SIX YOUNG SLAVES NOT GROWN UP
HAVING DISCOVERED HOW THEY COULD BREAK JAIL THEY WERE NOT LONG IN ACCOMPLISHING THEIR PURPOSE AND WERE OUT AND OFF TO THE WOODS AGAIN
OH IF MRS STOWE HAS CLOTHED AMERICAN SLAVERY IN THE GRACEFUL GARB OF FICTION SOLOMON NORTHRUP COMES UP FROM THE DARK HABITATION OF SOUTHERN CRUELTY WHERE SLAVERY FATTENS AND FEASTS ON HUMAN BLOOD WITH SUCH MOURNFUL REVELATIONS THAT ONE MIGHT ALMOST WISH FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY THAT THE TALES OF HORROR WHICH HE REVEALS WERE NOT SO
BUT AS HIS BRAVE HEART WAS BENT ON PROSECUTING HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HE CONCLUDED TO START AT ALL HAZARDS NOTWITHSTANDING THE DANGERS HE APPREHENDED FROM PASSING SAID TOWN BY DAYLIGHT
THEY ARE FROM NORFOLK--TIMES ARE VERY HARD IN CANADA 2 OF OUR OLD FRIENDS HAS LEFT CANADA AND COME TO BEDFORD FOR A LIVING
P.S.--SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MY NEGRO WOMAN SARAH JANE 25 YEARS OLD STOUT BUILT AND CHESTNUT COLOR HAS ALSO RUN OFF
HUNT WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED HERE FROM RICHMOND VA DESIRES ME TO ADDRESS TO YOU A LINE IN HIS BEHALF
PARTIES HURRYING ON WOULD ON ACCOUNT OF THIS OBSTRUCTION HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEIR HURRY WAS OVER AS THIS WAS ALL DONE IN THE INTEREST OF SLAVERY THE MATTER WAS NOT VERY LOUDLY CONDEMNED
RUTH HARPER GEORGE ROBINSON PRISCILLA GARDENER AND JOSHUA JOHN ANDERSON
THEIR AGES RANGED FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY-ONE AND THEY WERE APPARENTLY SERVANTS OF A VERY SUPERIOR ORDER
MY WIFE HAD BETTER CALL ON DR PERKINS AND PERHAPS HE WILL LET HER HAVE THE MONEY HE HAD IN CHARGE FOR ME BUT THAT I FAILED OF RECEIVING WHEN I LEFT BALTIMORE

ONE MAN IN TRYING TO PULL HIS BOOTS OFF FOUND THEY WERE FROZEN TO HIS FEET
SHE HAD FILLED VARIOUS SITUATIONS AS A SLAVE
BUT A MORE APT READY-WITTED ACTIVE INTELLIGENT AND SELF-RELIANT FELLOW IS NOT OFTEN SEEN
WHEN TOLD AT HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S AS SHE OVERHEARD IT THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE A WORSE THING C HE REPLIED THAT JANE WOULD NOT LEAVE HIM AS MUCH HOWEVER AS HE AFFECTED TO HAVE SUCH IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN JANE HE SCARCELY ALLOWED HER TO BE OUT OF HIS PRESENCE A MOMENT WHILE IN THIS CITY
FOREMAN ELLEN ALIAS ELIZ
ANTHONY WAS THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE AND BY BLOOD WAS QUITE AS NEARLY RELATED TO THE ANGLO-SAXON AS THE ANGLO-AFRICAN

WE ARE INDEBTED TO CAPTAIN F----T----N FOR THOSE
BUT THOUGH SHE MAY HAVE ENDED THIS ANTI-SLAVERY WORK WHICH IS BUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE DESTINY OF THE COLORED RACE IN AMERICA HER INFLUENCE IS NOT ENDED--_THAT CANNOT DIE

WILSON ESQ CASHIER OF THE VIRGINIA BANK
HOW MUCH LIGHT HAS IT THROWN FOR ME ON THE PAGE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
THANK GOD RANG OUT SONOROUSLY FROM HIS OVERFLOWING SOUL
HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO TOIL FOR THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN NOT ONLY ON HIS OWN PLACE BUT ON THE FARMS OF OTHERS
HENRY GORHAM WAS THIRTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE A PRIME HEAVY DARK SMART ARTICLE AND A GOOD CARPENTER
HAVING NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS ATTORNEY THERE HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AS BEST HE COULD CONSEQUENTLY HE WANTED BOOKS ETC
GIVE MY RESPECTS TO MRS STILL TELL HER I WANT TO SEE HER VERY BAD AND YOU ALSO I WOULD COME BUT I AM AFRAID YET TO VENTURE I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER THE SECOND BUT ABOUT THE FIRST OF SPRING I HOPE TO PAY YOU A VISIT OR NEXT SUMMER
PHILIP HAD SCARCELY REACHED HIS TWENTY-SECOND YEAR
WE ARE SURPRISED AND ALARMED
AT ONE TIME HOLDING AT BAY THE POWERS OF EVIL AND BAFFLING THE MOST DETERMINED OPPONENTS BY HIS MANLY ADHERENCE TO RIGHT
HEART-BREAKING AS WERE THESE REFLECTIONS SHE RESOLVED TO LEAVE ROBERT AND MARY IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND ESCAPE IF POSSIBLE FROM HER TERRIBLE THRALDOM
DUNCANS BENJ ALIAS GEO
IN THE FALL OF 1828
SHE HAD ASSURED HER SLAVES THAT SHE HAD PROVIDED FOR THEM IN HER WILL AND THAT AT HER DEATH ALL WOULD BE FREED
HE WAS ONCE TAKEN TO FLORIDA FOR THAT PURPOSE
UNDER THE GOOD PROVIDENCE THROUGH WHICH SHE CAME IN POSSESSION OF HER FREEDOM SHE FOUND A KIND HOME WITH A FAMILY OF ABOLITIONISTS MRS GILLINGHAM'S WHOSE HEARTS HAD BEEN IN DEEP SYMPATHY WITH THE SLAVE FOR MANY YEARS
PETER WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE
I HAVE NEVER OBJECTED TO THAT LANGUAGE IN SO FAR AS IT MIGHT TEND TO RECALL US TO THE DUTIES WHICH LIE IMMEDIATELY AROUND US AND IN SO FAR AS IT MIGHT TEND TO MAKE US FEEL THE FORGETFULNESS OF WHICH WE ARE SOMETIMES GUILTY OF THE MISERY AND POVERTY IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
SO HE ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS WITH THIS END IN VIEW AND LEFT HENRY JONES WITH ONE LESS TO WORK FOR HIM FOR NOTHING
JACOB IS TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE DARK CHESTNUT COLOR MEDIUM SIZE AND OF PREPOSSESSING MANNERS
HOW MR HYSON RAISED THE MONEY TO CARRY OUT HIS ENTERPRISE WILLIAM AND HIS UNGRATEFUL FELLOW-SERVANTS SEEMED NOT TO BE CONCERNED
THEN I PUT OUT FOR CANADA
OH HOW FEARFULLY THE JUDGMENTS OF ICHABOD HAVE PRESSED UPON THE NATION'S LIFE
HE HAD NEVER LIVED WITH HER HOWEVER
HE WAS SATISFIED NEVER TO WEAR THE YOKE AGAIN THAT SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT REAP THE BENEFIT OF HIS TOIL
PROBABLY YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THEM
HE WAS OF A DARK CHESTNUT COLOR AND OF MEDIUM SIZE
JAMES LAZARUS DELAWARE
AS THE SHOT WAS LIGHT THEY WERE NOT MUCH DAMAGED HOWEVER AT ANY RATE NOT DISCOURAGED
AT A VILLAGE IN THAT STATE CALLED BEREA SITUATED IN MADISON COUNTY A LITTLE BAND OF CHRISTIAN MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN PURSUING THEIR USEFUL LABORS FOR SOME YEARS PAST
WE HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN STATING THAT BEYOND OUR BORDERS ALSO ACROSS THE OCEAN THERE CAME HELP TO A LAUDABLE DEGREE IN THE HOUR OF NEED
AND IN REFERRING THEREFORE TO THE REPRESENTATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE TO ME I HAVE NO OTHER OBJECT THAN TO POINT YOU TO THE REASONS FOR MY ADDRESSING YOU AT THIS ADVANCED PERIOD OF OUR SESSIONS AND TO ENABLE YOU TO APPLY WITH MORE FACILITY AND CERTAINTY THE PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF LAW WHICH I SHALL PROCEED TO LAY BEFORE YOU
NIXON SAM ALIAS DR THOS
SAM SAW THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO BE GETTING OUT OF DANGER'S WAY WITHOUT DELAY SO HE PRESUMED IF OTHERS COULD MANAGE TO ESCAPE HE COULD TOO
HE HAD HOWEVER MANAGED TO STEAL THE ART OF READING AND WRITING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
VERY RESPECTFULLY YOURS W.H
THE NEXT MORNING AT AN EARLY HOUR THE COURT-ROOM AND ALL THE AVENUES TO IT WERE DENSELY CROWDED BY PEOPLE INTERESTED IN BEHALF OF THE WOMAN WHOSE CASE WAS UNDER TRIAL
HE TOO TALKED OF SLAVE-HOLDERS AND HIS MASTER IN PARTICULAR JUST AS ANY MAN WOULD TALK WHO HAD BEEN SHAMEFULLY ROBBED AND WRONGED ALL HIS LIFE
AND AT TIMES ESPECIALLY VINDICTIVE AGAINST THE NOBLE SISTERS BECAUSE OF THEIR EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION WITH OTHER FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE IN PREVENTING THE LICENSING OF A LIQUOR-SELLING TAVERN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IT IS FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF ONLY ONE SMALL PACKAGE
THE FUGITIVES THEMSELVES INNOCENTLY STATED THAT ONE OF THE MASTERS WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF FLOGGING ADULT FEMALES WAS A MODERATE MAN JOSIAH BAILEY WAS THE LEADER OF THIS PARTY AND HE APPEARED WELL-QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION
IN ORDER TO ENLIGHTEN THE READER WITH REGARD TO THIS SUBJECT IT SEEMS NECESSARY IN THIS CONNECTION TO PUBLISH AT LEAST ONE OF THE MANY STATUTES FROM THE SLAVE LAWS OF THE SOUTH BEARING DIRECTLY ON THE AID AND ESCAPE OF SLAVES BY VESSELS
CONDEMNED THEM FOR EVERYTHING AND DECIDED TO CHANGE HER POLICY IN FUTURE AND TO APPOINT HER OVERSEERS FROM HER OWN SLAVES SETTING THE PROPERTY TO WATCH THE PROPERTY
IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE SUBSEQUENT PAGES OF THIS WORK TO OMIT THE NARRATIVES OF A GREAT MANY WHO UNFORTUNATELY WERE BUT BRIEFLY NOTED ON THE BOOKS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL
THE WIFE WAS CAPTURED AND CARRIED BACK BUT THE HUSBAND ESCAPED
WHY NOT IN TIME BECOME MERCHANTS AND PRINCES IN THOSE COUNTRIES

YOU MUST UTILIZE THEM OR BE CONTENT TO REMAIN FOREVER THE INFERIOR RACE
WITH AN OATH HE WOULD SAY NOW DON'T YOU LOVE ME OH MASTER I WILL PRAY FOR YOU I WOULD CRY THEN HE WOULD CUSS HARDER THAN EVER HE BEAT ME UNTIL HE WAS TIRED AND QUIT

THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WERE SWEPT FROM HUNN IN AN INSTANT AND HIS FAMILY LEFT UTTERLY DESTITUTE
WHEN I LAST SAW YOU I PURPOSED TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS MATTER BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED VERY MUCH IN NOT GETTING TO TAKE TEA WITH YOU AS I PARTLY PROMISED
HIS MASTER WAS A YOUNG MAN FOND OF DRINKING AND CAROUSING AND ALWAYS READY FOR A FIGHT OR A KNOCK-DOWN A SHORT TIME BEFORE JOHN LEFT HIS MASTER WHIPPED HIM SO SEVERELY WITH THE BULL WHIP THAT HE COULD NOT USE HIS ARM FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS

WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS
IT SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT THIS CHANGE WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE HER FROM THE SPHERE OF HER FORMER USEFULNESS
ALTHOUGH STARTING FROM WIDELY SEPARATED LOCALITIES WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER IN THE SOUTH EACH SEPARATE PASSENGER EARNESTLY BENT ON FREEDOM HAD ENDURED SUFFERING HUNGER AND PERILS BY LAND AND WATER SUSTAINED BY THE HOPE OF ULTIMATE FREEDOM

I SHALL DO EVERY THING I CAN FOR THEM ALL THAT I SEE THE GENTLEMAN WISH YOU TO SEE HIS WIFE AND LET HER KNOW THAT HE ARRIVED SAFE AND PRESENT HIS LOVE TO HER AND TO ALL THE FRIEND

WHAT BECAME OF THEM AFTERWARDS WAS NEVER KNOWN AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION
THE POOR MOTHER'S EXCUSE FOR LEAVING HER COMFORTABLE HOME FREE BOARD AND KIND-HEARTED MASTER AND MISTRESS WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRED OF SUCH KINDNESS AND WAS THEREFORE WILLING TO SUFFER IN ORDER TO GET AWAY FROM IT

POWERFUL BAD TREATMENT AND NO PAY WAS THE ONLY REWARD POOR PERRY HAD EVER RECEIVED FOR HIS LIFE SERVICES
FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS IT WAS DEEMED DESIRABLE TO SEPARATE THE PARTY TO SEND SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER
BUT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER HIS DEATH SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF ONE OF THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTERS FROM WHOM SHE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED CONTINUED ABUSE ESPECIALLY WHEN SAID DAUGHTER WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR
SHE HAD PLUCK ENOUGH TO ENDURE UNTO THE END WITHOUT MURMURING
AND THESE QUALITIES MIGHT HAVE BECOME FAULTS IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN BALANCED BY AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS AND BENEVOLENCE
I CANNOT EVEN BEAR TO GIVE A PLACE IN MY LITTLE ALBUM TO SO MOURNFUL AND RIDICULOUS A MISREPRESENTATION OF HER IN FACE YOU WONDER WHY HER SISTER E MY LOVED AND FAITHFUL FRIEND SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH LESS KNOWN AMONG ANTI-SLAVERY PEOPLE THAN ABBIE

DON'T KNOW HOW SHE CAME THERE
HIS MASTER PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT SAM HAD NO MIND NOR ANY NEED OF A WIFE
THE DEDUCTIONS FROM THE FACTS WERE AS PLAIN AS THE FACTS THEMSELVES
WITH REGARD TO FOOD ALSO HE HAD FARED AS WELL AS HEART COULD WISH WITH ABUNDANCE OF LEISURE TIME AT HIS COMMAND
AS IN THE CASE OF MANY OTHERS THE WAY WAS SO COMPLETELY BLOCKED THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE FOR THE WIFE'S DELIVERANCE
BUT HE NEVER WOULD REFUSE HIS AID TO THE HUNTED PANTING WRETCH THAT IN THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS WAS SEEKING AFTER LIBERTY

EARLY ON SECOND DAY MORNING MONDAY THOMAS WENT OVER WITH JOHN WALES ATTORNEY AT LAW
THAT ITS MOTHER WAS DEAD AND IT HAD NOBODY TO TAKE CARE OF IT
BUT IF YOU NEED MORE SEND ME WORD
I CANNOT DWELL LONGER ON THIS PAINFUL SUBJECT NOW
HE THEN SAID IF ANYBODY WOULD KNOW HER I WOULD AS SHE HAD LIVED WITH MY BROTHER THREE YEARS
FOR FIRST HIS LABOR FOR THE LOVE OF MAN WAS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE MOULD AND MOVEMENTS OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE
BAILEY A TOBACCO MERCHANT OF RICHMOND
NO LIVING BEING SHALL BE FOUND TO SAY HE EVER SPOKE TO THEM
AS CHIVALROUS AS SLAVE-HOLDERS AND SLAVE-CATCHERS WERE THEY KNEW THE VALUE OF THEIR PRECIOUS LIVES AND THE FEARFUL RISK OF ATTEMPTING A CAPTURE WHEN THE NUMBERS WERE EQUAL
CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SHED TEARS WHEN A POOR CREATURE ESCAPED FTOM HIS KIND MASTER NOR WAS HE WILLING TO TURN A DEAF EAR TO HIS APPEALS AND GROANS WHEN HE KNEW HE WAS THIRSTING FOR FREEDOM
AND YET I AM NOT UNEASY ABOUT THE RESULT OF THIS WAR
BAILEY HAS LATELY BEEN HERE AND DR CHEEVER AND W.H
THE WEATHER ARE VERY COLD AT PRESENT THE SNOW CONTINUE TO FALL THOUGH NOT AS DEEP HERE AS IT IS IN BOSTON
SIGNED JAMES MONROE PETER HEINES HENRY JAMES MORRIS AND MATTHEW BODAME THIS INTELLIGENCE WAS VERY GRATIFYING AND MOST ASSUREDLY ADDED TO THE PLEASURABLE CONTEMPLATION OF HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING OUT A HELPING HAND TO THE FLEEING BONDMAN

THAT SHE HAD ILL-TREATED HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND HAD OF LATE THREATENED TO SELL HIM TO GEORGIA

ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FENTON WAS FOUND BY WILLIAM WRIGHT OUT IN THE FIELD
HE WHOSE CONSCIENCE OR WHOSE THEORIES OF POLITICAL OR INDIVIDUAL RIGHT FORBID HIM TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN IT IN ITS FULLEST INTEGRITY MAY RELIEVE HIMSELF FROM THE DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP BY DIVESTING HIMSELF OF ITS RIGHTS
AFTER PASSING AN HOUR OR SO WITH THEM DICK WAS BROUGHT AWAY BUT HE HAD BEEN SO TOUCHED BY THEIR KINDNESS THAT HE FELT THAT HE MUST SEE THEM AGAIN BEFORE LEAVING THE CITY
WE HAVE ONLY TO ALLOW THE FRIENDS TO WHOM WE ALLUDE TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WHEN THEIR HEARTS WERE STIRRED IN THE INTEREST OF THE ESCAPING SLAVE AND THEY WERE PRACTICALLY DOING UNTO OTHERS AS THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO THEM
I WOULD SEND THEM ON TO-NIGHT BUT WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE TWO OF THEM WITH SOME CLOTHES BEFORE THEY CAN BE SENT BY RAIL ROAD
HE WAS THE SLAVE OF MRS JANE COULTSON
WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT IT AT THE CLOSING MEETING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY HELD IN PHILADELPHIA MAY 5 1870 THE FOLLOWING WAS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED
TO BE SURE SOME OF US BROTHERS OWN SOME PROPERTY BUT NO GREAT AMOUNT
HE WAS A VERY MEAN MAN TO HIS SERVANTS SAID ANDREW AND I GOT SO TIRED OF HIM I COULDN'T STAND HIM ANY LONGER ANDREW WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE ORDINARY SIZE
HENRY TUDLE AND WIFE MARY WILLIAMS
TWO OF THEM HE WAS VERY FOND OF AND DESIRED TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING SOLD IF POSSIBLE

WHILE MILES AND HIS FRIENDS WERE WILLING TO SUFFER FOR A PRINCIPLE THE DIRT FILTH COLD AND DISAGREEABLENESS OF THE QUARTERS THAT THEY MOST LIKELY WOULD BE COMPELLED TO OCCUPY ALL NIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING DAY SUNDAY FORBADE SUBMISSION
WILLIAM HOWARD DAY THEN CAME FORWARD SAYING HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE FOR ONE OF HIS RACE TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON THIS OCCASION AND MAKE SOME ATTEMPT TO PAY A FITTING TRIBUTE TO ONE TO WHOM THEY OWED SO MUCH
THOUGH AS WILL APPEAR PRESENTLY OTHER CAUSES ALSO HELPED TO MAKE HIM HATE HIS OPPRESSION
AND HE INVITED ME TO GO WITH HIM
DUGDALE SO WELL KNOWN IN REFORMATORY CIRCLES AS AN ARDENT FRIEND OF HUMANITY
SHAW ELIJAH 458
HIS NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF TAPPAN BIRNEY GREEN JAY GARRISON AND OTHER LEADING ABOLITIONISTS WHO WERE SINGLED OUT BY SLAVE-HOLDERS AND THEIR ABETTORS AS FIT SUBJECTS FOR THE MERCILESS ATTACKS OF EXCITED MOBS
I AM HAPPY HAPPY

THE AUCTION BLOCK IS DEFEATED AND A SLAVE TRADER LOSES FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
I DO LIKE HER SO
NOT IN THE FIELD FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORKED THERE
I TALKED FREELY
I THINK DEAR FRIEND THOU SHOULDST BE CAREFUL NOT TO BE ABOUT ALONE PARTICULARLY IN THE EVENING
HIS LIFE EVEN IN THESE MINUTE PARTICULARS SHOWED HOW THE WHOLE MAN IS HARMONIZED BY THE SENSE OF BEING EVER IN THE GREAT TASKMASTER'S EYE HE DIED ON THE 7TH OF MAY 1852 IN HIS EIGHTY-FIRST YEAR AND A PUBLIC FUNERAL IN THE TABERNACLE BROUGHT TOGETHER THOUSANDS DESIROUS OF SHOWING RESPECT TO HIS MEMORY MRS CHILD HAS WRITTEN A FULL AND IN MANY RESPECTS AN EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING BIOGRAPHY OF THE SUBJECT OF THIS MEMOIR TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF WHICH SHE SAYS
ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT KNOW A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET THEY WERE FULLY PERSUADED THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO THEIR FREEDOM
AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL IT WAS PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE THAT NO LACK OF PAINS AND FALSE SWEARING WOULD BE RESORTED TO ON THE PART OF WHEELER AND HIS WITNESSES TO GAIN A VERDICT
THERE WAS AN OFFER
JOE IS ABOUT 20 YEARS OLD ABOUT FIVE FEET SIX INCHES HIGH HEAVY BUILT AND HAS A GRUM LOOK AND VOICE DULL AND BLACK
WHY SAID SHE IN A VOICE OF MUCH SURPRISE I HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD SINCE I HAVE BEEN SOUTH THAT SOMETIMES COLORED HUSBANDS POSITIVELY BEAT THEIR WIVES
THE SPECTATORS NUMBERED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED
WE RETURNED TO THE STATUE AND STOOD NEAR THE AMERICAN BY WHOM IT HAD BEEN TAKEN UP TO GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING ANY REMARKS HE CHOSE UPON THE MATTER
AND I WILL ENDEVOR TO MEET HIM THERE WITH SOME MONEY TO ASSIST HIM IN GETTING THEM
THE FEAR OF WHAT AWAITED THE SLAVES PROMPTED ANDREW TO ESCAPE
DUNMORE HENRY 526
I LIVED THERE AND HIRED MY TIME FOR AWHILE
THIS THREAT ONLY SERVED TO AROUSE HIM COMPLETELY
I DID NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD ASK SUCH A QUESTION OR THAT YOU WOULD REQUEST ANYTHING LIKE THAT JACOB REMARKED NATURALLY SOMEWHAT NERVOUS BUT HE ADDED I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING ANY ONE I PLEASE IN MY HOUSE WHERE IS HE FROM AGAIN DEMANDED THE MASTER
PRISCILLA GARDENER FLED FROM THE WIDOW HILLIARD
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE NEEDED TO BE DONE QUICKLY BEFORE HIS MASTER'S PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED
HAPPY
I MUST CLOSE AS IT AM LATE HOUR AT NIGHT
OVER HER SLAVES SHE KEPT AN OVERSEER WHO WAS A VERY WICKED MAN
CARRIER OF THE NATIONAL AMERICAN BLOOD FLOWED FREELY
WHAT NEW HONOR AND BLESSING WOULD SURROUND THE VENERATED NAME OF OUR DEPARTED FRIEND AND LEADER
WE TRAVEL TOGETHER EAT TOGETHER AND SLEEP TOGETHER
HE MADE AXE HANDLES MATS ETC OF EVENINGS AND CAUGHT MUSK RATS ON SUNDAY AND AVAILED HIMSELF OF THEIR HIDES TO PROCURE MEANS FOR HIS MOST PRESSING WANTS
AFTER THE FAMILY HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED FROM THE FATIGUE AND TRAVEL-WORN CONDITION IN WHICH THEY ARRIVED AND WERE PREPARED TO RESUME THEIR JOURNEY THE COMMITTEE GAVE THEM THE STRICTEST CAUTION WITH REGARD TO AVOIDING SLAVE-HUNTERS AND ALSO IN REFERENCE TO SUCH POINTS ON THE ROAD WHERE THEY WOULD BE MOST IN DANGER OF GOING ASTRAY FROM A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAY
THOMAS THE COMPANION OF GEORGE WAS OF A TRULY REMARKABLE STRUCTURE
IT IS SUPPOSED THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO PENNSYLVANIA
I WAS NOT THE ENEMY OF ANY MAN LIVING
AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED THAT UPON AFFIDAVIT MADE BY THE CLAIMANT OF SUCH FUGITIVE HIS AGENT OR ATTORNEY AFTER SUCH CERTIFICATE HAS BEEN ISSUED THAT HE HAS REASON TO APPREHEND THAT SUCH FUGITIVE WILL BE RESCUED BY FORCE FROM HIS OR THEIR POSSESSION BEFORE HE CAN BE TAKEN BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE ARREST IS MADE IT SHALL BE THE DUTY OF THE OFFICER MAKING THE ARREST TO RETAIN SUCH FUGITIVE IN HIS CUSTODY AND TO REMOVE HIM TO THE STATE WHENCE HE FLED AND THERE TO DELIVER HIM TO SAID CLAIMANT HIS AGENT OR ATTORNEY
SEVERAL EXCITED SPEECHES WERE MADE AND GREAT ENTHUSIASM WAS MANIFESTED IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND THE ADJACENT STREETS
FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED SECRETED
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY STARTED THAT THEIR LITTLE BOAT WAS WEAK COMBINED WITH THEIR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IN RELATION TO THE IMMINENT DANGER SURROUNDING THEM ANY INTELLIGENT MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN PREDICTING FOR THEM A WATERY GRAVE LONG BEFORE THE BAY WAS HALF CROSSED
IT IS CUSTOMARY WHEN A STRANGE NEGRO IS SEEN FOR ANY WHITE MAN TO SEIZE THE NEGRO AND CONVEY SUCH NEGRO THROUGH AND OUT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO PADUCAH KY AND LODGE SUCH STRANGER IN PADUCAH JAIL AND THERE CLAIM SUCH REWARD AS MAY BE OFFERED BY THE MASTER
TWO OTHERS WERE YOUNG PEOPLE ONE TWO AND THE OTHER THREE YEARS OUT OF SLAVERY A GIRL OF FIFTEEN AND A BOY OF TWELVE WHOSE INTERESTING APPEARANCE INDUCED A NOBLE-HEARTED ANTI-SLAVERY LADY TO RECEIVE THEM INTO HER OWN FAMILY EXPRESSLY TO EDUCATE THEM
WITH THESE VIEWS HE GAVE MUCH TIME AND WORK TO ORGANIZING IN THIS STATE THE NATIONAL LIBERTY PARTY IN 1840 AND TO SECURING FROM PENNSYLVANIA SOME OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND VOTES THAT WERE CAST FOR JOHN G
THAT HE COULD DELIBERATELY ENTER THE ENEMY'S DOMAIN AND WITH THE FAITH OF A MARTYR FACE THE DREAD SLAVE-HOLDER WITH HIS BOWIE-KNIVES AND REVOLVERS--SLAVE-HUNTERS AND BLOOD-HOUNDS LYNCHINGS AND PENITENTIARIES FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE
A MOST WORTHY LADY IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND REFERS TO HER IN THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE
PRIVILEGES OF ALL KINDS WERE RARE WITH HIM
OR A FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS IN CASES WHERE PROOF SHALL NOT IN THE OPINION OF SAID COMMISSIONER WARRANT SUCH CERTIFICATE AND DELIVERY INCLUSIVE OF ALL SERVICES INCIDENT TO SUCH ARREST AND EXAMINATION TO BE PAID IN EITHER CASE BY THE CLAIMANT HIS OR HER AGENT OR ATTORNEY
WHAT UNDERSTANDING WAS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THEM PRIOR TO HER DEPARTURE WE FAILED TO NOTE AT THE TIME
PAULINA WAS THE FIRST SOLD TWO YEARS AGO LAST MAY
I CHERISH NO PERSONAL ENMITIES
NO FRIEND OF HERS WOULD FOR A MOMENT THINK OF PERMITTING THAT MISERABLE CARICATURE THE ONLY PICTURE EXISTING MEANT TO REPRESENT HER TO BE GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC
212 ISLAND
HE WORE AWAY A BLACK COAT AND BROWN PANTALOONS
HISTORICALLY THE BOOK IS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT IS FACT AND NOT FICTION ALTHOUGH FIFTY YEARS FROM TO-DAY IT WILL READ LIKE FICTION TO THE THEN LIVING
BUT IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE SITUATION THAT AWAITED HIM ON THE BOAT OR HIS HEART MIGHT HAVE FAILED HIM
THE KEENNESS OF HIS EYES AND QUICKNESS OF HIS PERCEPTION HOWEVER WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE RENDERED HIM AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION IN SOME PARTS OF THE SOUTH
MY OWN OPINION IS WE HAD BETTER SEND THEM TO HOOK AND THERE PUT THEM IN THE CARS TO-NIGHT AND SEND A PILOT TO TAKE THEM TO THY HOUSE
I HAD HEARD THAT A WOMAN WAS ARRESTED
ANDERSON TO OUR RECORD BOOK AND CONCLUDED TO LET THAT SUFFICE
HE HAD LESS SPIRIT THAN HIS WIFE WHO HAD BEEN DIRECTLY GOADED TO DESPERATION

THE WEALTHY HAD ALL GONE TO THE SPRINGS
MARTIN AND AS A WITNESS WAS PREPARED TO TESTIFY THAT MARTIN ILL-TREATED HIS SLAVES ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THE DIET WHICH WAS VERY POOR NEVERTHELESS JAMES WAS A STOUT HEAVY-BUILT YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE AND LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF VALUABLE WORK IN HIM

LONG BEFORE THAT TIME HOWEVER THREE OTHER BROTHERS FLED ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IT WARNS NORTHERN VOTERS OF THE UNDERTOW THAT IS DRAWING THEM AND ADJURES THEM BY EVERY CONSIDERATION OF POLITICAL COMMON SENSE NOT TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR EITHER OF THE PRO-SLAVERY CANDIDATES PRESENTED
SHE GAVE HER HUSBAND TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO SEEK A HOME IN CANADA
LEWIS ON PAGE THIRTY-NINE THROWING MUCH LIGHT ON THIS ARRIVAL AFTER RECEIVING FRIENDLY AID AND ADVICE WHILE THERE THEY WERE FORWARDED TO THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
WHEN THE CRIER'S HAMMER INDICATED THE LAST BID ALTHOUGH BURRIS HAD BORNE UP HEROICALLY THROUGHOUT THE TRYING ORDEAL HE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF FRIENDS BUT ON THE CONTRARY EVIDENTLY LABORED UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS FREEDOM WAS GONE
FROM LAWRENCEVILLE AND LIMERICK AND POTTSTOWN AND PUGHTOWN CAME CONTRIBUTIONS OF CLOTHING
THAT HE DID NOT LOSE HIS AFFECTION FOR HER WHOM HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY IS SHOWN BY THE APPENDED LETTER
A FEW BRIEF WORDS FROM SAM SOON EXPLAINED THE MYSTERY
THE BLOOD WAS LITERALLY DRAWN FROM THEM AT EVERY PORE IN FRIGHTFUL QUANTITIES
YOU MAY BY THIS SEE WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN CANADA
YOUNG AS SHE WAS SHE HAD SEEN MUCH OF SLAVERY AND HAD DOUBTLESS PROFITED BY THE LESSONS THEREOF

NOT ACCUSTOMED TO RESIGNING THEM TO THE CARE OF A NURSE I WAS MUCH CONFINED TO THEM DURING THEIR INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD NOTWITHSTANDING HER DEVOTION TO PUBLIC MATTERS HER PRIVATE DUTIES WERE NEVER NEGLECTED
THERE HE HID IN A STABLE UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON AT SIX O'CLOCK WHEN HE SECRETED HIMSELF ON BOARD THE KEYSTONE STATE
LOUISA BROWN
THE BACK WAS SHOWN AND A MOST FRIGHTFUL PICTURE WAS PRESENTED
ONE THROUGH ILLINOIS COMMENCING ABOVE AND BELOW ALTON
SHE WAS ALSO ALLOWED TO LIVE IN WASHINGTON
EVER MANUMITTED ANY FEMALE SLAVES
JOHN WESLEY GALLOWAY WAS THE PROMPT RESPONSE
WILLIAM PENN AND OTHER FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON WERE MOST VIGILANT AND KNEW WHERE TO FIND PASSENGERS WHO WERE DAILY THIRSTING FOR DELIVERANCE
FERVENT IN SOUL ELOQUENT IN SPEECH MOST GRACIOUS IN MANNER HE WAS A FAVORITE ON THE PLATFORM OF ANTI-SLAVERY MEETINGS
HENRY PASSED TWELVE MONTHS IN THIS WAY BEHOLDING NO HUMAN SOUL SAVE HIS BROTHER
I'LL TRUST DAN FOR I BELIEVE HE IS THE VERY MAN THE DIFFICULTY WHICH MR MCKIM HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO OVERCOME WAS THUS PRETTY WELL SETTLED
IT IS DUE TO THE GREAT INTERESTS OF PUBLIC JUSTICE NO LESS THAN TO THE PARTIES IMPLICATED IN A CRIMINAL CHARGE THAT THEIR CAUSE SHOULD BE IN NO WISE AND IN NO DEGREE PREJUDGED

AMERICAN OFFICE RICHMOND JULY 20TH 1857

WILL YOU PLEASE WRITE ME WHEN CONVENIENT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT THOSE WHO I FEAR ARE SUFFERING AS THE RESULT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO ME

I WISH YOU TO INQUIRE OF MR ANDERSON'S FRIENDS IF YOU KNOW ANY OF THEM IF THEY HAVE HEARD ANYTHING FROM HIM SINCE HE WAS IN YOUR CITY
SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH WAS STINGY AND VERY MEAN TOWARDS HER SLAVES
THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED THE TROUBLE OF CHANGING MASTERS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING BEEN SOLD
WHEN TOO SICK TO WORK HER MISTRESS INVARIABLY TOOK THE GROUND THAT NOTHING WAS THE MATTER NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HER FAMILY PHYSICIAN DR ELLSOM HAD PRONOUNCED HER QUITE WEAKLY AND SICK IN AN ANGRY MOOD ONE DAY MRS CAHELL DECLARED SHE WOULD CURE HER
FROM THE FREQUENT ARRIVALS FROM VIRGINIA ESPECIALLY IN STEAMERS IT MAY BE THOUGHT THAT NO VERY STRINGENT LAWS OR REGULATIONS EXISTED BY WHICH OFFENDERS WHO MIGHT AID THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD COULD BE SEVERELY PUNISHED--THAT THE SLAVE-HOLDERS WERE LENIENT INDIFFERENT AND UNGUARDED AS TO HOW THIS PROPERTY TOOK WINGS AND ESCAPED

MY HEART ACHES MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS I CANNOT WRITE MORE
BY THIS TIME I HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD FROM MY WOUNDS THAT THEY CONCLUDED MY SITUATION WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO ADMIT OF BEING TAKEN FURTHER
IT WAS SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HER TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT PERTAINED TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD THAT EVEN THE DELIVERANCE OF A LITTLE NAMELESS BOY WAS NOT BENEATH HER NOTICE
HOW COULD SHE REFUSE
CHARLES WAS QUITE A LIKELY-LOOKING ARTICLE NOT TOO BLACK OR TOO WHITE BUT RATHER OF A NICE GINGER-BREAD COLOR DAVIS WAS OF OPINION THAT THIS ARTICLE MUST BRING HIM A TIP-TOP PRICE

HE ANXIOUSLY LOOKED WHILE THE FREIGHT WAS BEING UNLOADED FROM THE CARS TO SEE IF HE COULD RECOGNIZE A BOX THAT MIGHT CONTAIN A MAN
SHE SEEMED TO APPRECIATE FREEDOM ALL THE MORE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT IT COST HER TO OBTAIN THE PRIZE
BETWEEN THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE WHEN HE BEGAN TO KEEP A DEPOT ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND THE YEAR 1824 HE PASSED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SLAVES THROUGH TO CANADA AND BETWEEN THE LATTER TIME AND HIS DEATH EIGHT HUNDRED MORE MAKING IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AIDED BY HIM

PERRY'S EXIT WAS IN NOVEMBER 1853
I HAD HEARD THAT MY OLD MISTRESS HAD WILLED ME TO HER CHILDREN AND CHILDREN'S CHILDREN
IT WAS A GLOOMY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER
HIS OBJECT WAS TO HAVE ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A PRIVATE BERTH ON ONE OF THE RICHMOND STEAMERS AND ALSO TO HAVE A LITTLE LEFT TO FALL BACK ON AFTER LANDING IN A STRANGE LAND AND AMONG STRANGERS
BEFORE THIS EXAMINATION NEITHER OF THE INDIVIDUALS PRESENT FOR A MOMENT ENTERTAINED THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT BUT THAT SHE WAS A LAD SO WELL HAD SHE ACTED HER PART IN EVERY PARTICULAR

ALTHOUGH AMONG THEIR NEIGHBORS THERE WERE BITTER ADVERSARIES OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE EAGER TO FIND OCCASION FOR HOSTILE ACTS AGAINST ANY ABOLITIONIST

FREQUENTLY SLAVES WOULD BE SNATCHED UP HAND CUFFED AND HURRIED OFF SOUTH ON THE NIGHT TRAIN WITHOUT AN HOUR'S NOTICE FEARING THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS FATE HE DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO TAKE A NORTHERN TRAIN VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WITHOUT GIVING ANY NOTICE
THE TIME HAD NOW COME HOWEVER WHEN SOMETHING MUST BE DONE

ISAAC WAS A STOUT-MADE YOUNG MAN ABOUT TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE POSSESSING A GOOD DEGREE OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABILITY
IN REGIONS OF COUNTRY WHERE MEN WERE LESS CRITICAL AND LESS EXPERIENCED THAN SOUTHERNERS AS TO HOW THE BLEACHING PROCESS WAS BROUGHT ABOUT CORNELIUS SCOTT WOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER IN PASSING FOR A WHITE MAN OF THE MOST IMPROVED ANGLO-SAXON TYPE
FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF HIM
DURING THIS RIDE HE AFTERWARDS ASSURED HIS FRIENDS HE FELT THE INIQUITY AND ABOMINATION OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY BORNE IN UPON HIS MIND SO STRONGLY AS TO FAIRLY APPAL HIM AND HE SEEMED TO HEAR A VOICE WITHIN HIM ASSURING HIM THAT HIS WORK IN LIFE MUST BE TO HELP AND DEFEND THIS PERSECUTED RACE
IN EITHER EASE TO BE LODGED IN CAMBRIDGE JAIL
I BELONGED TO SENATOR MASON
HE LIVED IN BALTIMORE COUNTY NEAR WRIGHTSTOWN

J.W.C
WOODS
SO HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF BE SOLD SOME DAY AND THUS THE RESOLUTION CAME HOME TO HIM VERY FORCIBLY TO MAKE TRACKS FOR CANADA
BUT WHO THE AGENTS WERE OR HOW TO FIND THE DEPOT WAS A SERIOUS PUZZLE TO HIM
SUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT AUGUST 1ST 1855

SIR IF THIS SHOULD REACH YOU BE ASSURED THAT IT COMES FROM THE SAME POOR INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE
ANSWER YOUR COMMUNICATION AT HARRISBURG
OF COURSE THEIR PROVISIONS GAVE OUT BEFORE THEY WERE FAIRLY ON THE WAY BUT NOT SO WITH THE STORM
IN THE MEAN TIME THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS AND SEVERAL FUGITIVES WERE ARRESTED IN PHILADELPHIA AND SENT BACK TO THEIR MASTERS
THEY WISH ME TO COMMUNICATE THEIR KIND REGARDS TO YOU AND OTHERS WHO HAVE AIDED THEM
GIVE MY LOVE TO MR ANTHONY ALSO TO MR ORMSTED AND FAMILY
FLETCHER WISHES TO HAVE MR DADE CALL ON HIS BROTHER JAMES AND COMMUNICATE TO HIM HIS AFFECTIONATE REGARDS AND MAKE KNOWN TO HIM THAT HE IS SAFE AND CHEERFUL AND HAPPY
MISS GORDON RAISED OSCAR FROM A CHILD AND HAD TREATED HIM AS A PET
IT WAS OWING TO THE FACT THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD BEEN FREED THAT THEY ENTERTAINED THE VAGUE NOTION THAT THEY TOO MIGHT BE FREED
ALTHOUGH HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD IN SLAVERY HE DECIDED TO FLEE FOR HIS FREEDOM AT ALL HAZARDS AND ACCORDINGLY HE CARRIED OUT HIS FIRM RESOLUTION
WHILE HE WAS GONE I SAID MASSA NOW YOU ARE GOING TO TIE ME UP AND CUT ME ALL TO PIECES FOR NOTHING
SHE HOWEVER ESCAPED THROUGH A BACK WINDOW AND GAVE THE ALARM
HE FLED FROM JAMES SAUNDERS ESQ
GOOD LUCK ATTENDED HIM AND HE REACHED THE COMMITTEE SAFELY
CUNNAGAN
PER SCHOONER--TWICE SEARCHED--LANDED AT LEAGUE ISLAND
THE INCIDENTS CONNECTED WITH THEIR LIVES IN SLAVERY AND WHEN ESCAPING WERE BUT BRIEFLY WRITTEN OUT
ON ARRIVING HE WAS PUT AT ONCE IN THE CHARGE OF THE COMMITTEE
THROUGH MR TAPPAN'S INFLUENCE AND EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE ABROAD MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR WHICH WAS HELD IN BROOKLYN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE
LUCINDA LEFT HER FATHER MOSES EDGAR WRIGHT AND TWO BROTHERS BOTH SLAVES
BUT GEORGE'S BLOOD WAS UP SO PAINED WAS HE AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN A POOR MAN A HELPLESS MAN BEING DRAGGED THROUGH FROM PENNSYLVANIA WITH A HALTER AROUND HIS NECK THAT AMIDST THE JEERS AND INSULTS OF THE DEBASED CROWD HE DENOUNCED SLAVERY ITS AIDERS AND ABETTORS IN TONES OF SCORN AND LOATHING
MANN AND THOMAS CARMICHAEL THEY PASSED HERE ABOUT A MONTH SINCE
THE APPOINTED HOUR FOR THE STARTING OF THE STEAMER WAS TEN O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING
JACOB BROWN JAMES HARRIS BENJAMIN PINEY JOHN SMITH ANDREW JACKSON WILLIAM HUGHES WESLEY WILLIAMS ROSANNA JOHNSON JOHN SMALLWOOD AND HENRY TOWNSEND
IN ALL THIS TURMOIL OF RIOT THEY SAW ON THE ONE SIDE INDEED A LOVE OF MAN GREAT IN ITS DEVOTION
FROM THE FIRST HE FELT THAT THE MOVEMENT WHICH BROUGHT FREEDOM AND SLAVERY FAIRLY INTO THE FIELD AND SQUARELY AGAINST EACH OTHER THREW UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES IN ITS OWN WAY BY THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS BEGUN AND PROSECUTED
WHETHER IT WAS SO OR NOT IN THIS CASE IT WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY SO IN OTHER INSTANCES AS IS WELL REMEMBERED
TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCHES WERE SENT ALL THROUGH THE SOUTH
SHE WAS ASKED
HE WAS A MAN OF NOT QUITE MEDIUM SIZE WITH MARKED FEATURES OF MIND AND CHARACTER
LEWIS EDWARD 422
WILSON
RESURRECTION OF HENRY BOX BROWN DAN AN IRISHMAN ONE OF ADAMS EXPRESS DRIVERS IS JUST THE FELLOW TO GO TO THE DEPOT AFTER THE BOX SAID DAVIS
BUT IT WAS DECREED THAT THOSE FEELINGS OF HONEST INDIGNATION SHOULD BE SPEEDILY SUPPLANTED BY THE WARM OUTPOURING OF PUBLIC GRATITUDE AND JOY
YORK THE FRIEND WAS FROM RICHMOND VIRGINIA A WHITE MAN THE AMOUNT WAS FIFTEEN DOLLARS I FORWARD A LETTER TO YOU YESTERDAY WHICH LETTER I FORGOT TO DATE
AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME
BUT ON A PLEASANT VISIT MADE LAST FALL TO FRIEND WM
SEVERAL SLAVES ESCAPED FROM DR PURNELL
IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER AS IN THOUSANDS OF OTHER INSTANCES THAT NO WILL COULD BE FOUND AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATORS RETAINED THE SLAVE PROPERTY REGARDLESS OF ANY VERBAL EXPRESSIONS RESPECTING FREEING ETC
I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE HER AGAIN IN VERMONT
DAILY HE PRAYED IN HIS PLACE OF CONCEALMENT HOW TO FIND THE U.G.R.R
WHEN THEY FOUND THE CAPTAIN THEY WERE NOT FAR FROM CAPE MAY LIGHT-HOUSE
THE COLORED MEN PRESENTED THEMSELVES SUCCESSIVELY AT THE WINDOW AND ASKED IF THEY WERE THE SLAVES CLAIMED
BUT I DID NOT LET MY OWNERS KNOW MY FEELINGS
DEPOT WILMINGTON 3MO
THEY HAVE FOUND EMPLOYMENT AND ARE LIKELY TO DO WELL
ABOUT ONE MONTH BEFORE JEREMIAH LEFT HE WAS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON HIS MASTER'S FARM WITH THE HOPE THAT HE COULD BE MADE MORE PROFITABLE THERE THAN HE WAS IN BEING HIRED OUT
HOOPER HENRY 339
A POLICEMAN IN THE STREET GOOD-NATUREDLY WHISPERED TO HIM HIS OWN NAME AND THEN THAT OF HIS MASTERS
IT WAS FELT THAT A MAN OF RARE PROBITY AND VIRTUE HAD GONE TO HIS REWARD
IT ALSO HAPPENED JUST ABOUT THIS TIME THAT SHE WAS FURTHER MOVED TO ENTER THE ANTI-SLAVERY FIELD AS A LECTURER SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCE
HE WILL FIND PARTIES WHO WILL PAY HIM FOR DOING SO
SOME CHARGED THE SERVANTS WITH HAVING A HAND IN HER LEAVING BUT ALL AGREED THAT SHE HAD LEFT A VERY KIND AND INDULGENT MISTRESS AND HAD ACTED VERY FOOLISHLY IN RUNNING OUT OF SLAVERY INTO FREEDOM
THE LETTERS THAT HAVE GONE FROM HIM TO HIS FRIENDS IN VIRGINIA HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY ME AND SENT IN SUCH A MANNER AS WE THOUGHT WOULD BEST ENSURE SAFETY
THEY WENT OFF AND ONE OF THEM WAS OBSERVED BY ONE OF THE FAMILY TO TAKE HIS COAT HASTILY DOWN FROM WHERE IT HUNG IN ONE OF THE OUTHOUSES A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD
NOW IT HAS BECOME A SYMBOL OF PROTECTION AND FREEDOM
WHILE IN HIS FAMILY SHE GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND WAS MUCH ESTEEMED FOR UPRIGHTNESS AND INDUSTRY
ONE PLACE ALONE NEAR THE CISTERN PRESENTED SOME CHANCE FOR A HIDING-PLACE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY HIM QUITE WELL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SAM WAS LED TO SEEK THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN ORDER TO GET RID OF HIS MASTER AND AT THE SAME TIME TO DO BETTER FOR HIMSELF THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO IN SLAVERY
ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT
WELL PERHAPS IT IS MY LOT TO DIE FROM HOME AND BE BURIED AMONG STRANGERS
WITH THE HELP OF PASSENGERS BELOW SHE WAS SQUEEZED THROUGH BUT NOT WITHOUT BRUISING AND BREAKING THE SKIN CONSIDERABLY WHERE THE RUB WAS SEVEREST
HE WAS A BROTHER OF JOHN AND SAID THAT HE ALSO HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY ENSLAVED BY DAVID HOUSTON ALLUDED TO ABOVE
REALLY CHARLES REASONED THE CASE SO WELL IN HIS UNCULTURED COUNTRY PHRASES THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS RATHER SURPRISED AND ADMIRED HIS SPIRIT IN ESCAPING
THE SUBJOINED LETTER GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DULY RECEIVED
HE WAS A MAN OF MUCH NATURAL ABILITY QUITE DARK WELL-MADE AND SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN WORKED VERY HARD ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENT HE HAD BEEN AN ACCEPTABLE PREACHER IN THE AFRICAN METHODIST CHURCH AND WAS ALSO RESPECTED BY THE RESPECTABLE WHITE AND COLORED PEOPLE IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD HE WOULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED BUT FOR FEAR OF BEING SOLD AS HE HAD A WIFE AND FIVE CHILDREN TO WHOM HE WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED BUT HAD TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE WESLEY LEFT THE OVERSEER FOR SOME TRIFLING CAUSE ATTEMPTED TO FLOG HIM BUT WAS RESISTED AND HIMSELF FLOGGED
AND SHE NEVER LOST AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE SPEAK OR SERVE THE CAUSE IN ANY WAY THAT SHE THOUGHT WOULD BEST PROMOTE THE FREEDOM OF THE SLAVE
HOW THIS HAPPENED NEITHER CHARLES NOR HIS FRIENDS COULD CONJECTURE
YOUR WELL WISHER ISAAC FORMAN
THE SUM NOW REMITTED THROUGH OUR FRIEND SAMUEL RHOADS IS L8 EIGHT POUNDS OF THIS WE SHOULD LIKE L3 TO BE PLACED AT THY OWN DISCRETION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FUGITIVES L3 IF YOU APPROVE IT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO BE HANDED TO J.W
WHILE I AM WRITING A COLORED MAN STANDS HERE WITH A TALE OF WRONG--HE HAS WORKED A WHOLE YEAR YEAR BEFORE LAST AND NOW HE HAS BEEN PUT OFF WITH FIFTEEN BUSHELS OF CORN AND HIS FOOD
BUT HE DESIRED NO EULOGY AND NEEDS NONE
ADAM'S TALE IS SOON TOLD
IN ONE SENSE THEY APPEARED TO BE IN A SAD CONDITION IT BEING THE DEAD OF WINTER BUT THEIR CONDITION IN ALEXANDRIA UNDER A BRUTAL MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH BOTH HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO HAVE WAS MUCH SADDER
THEY ARE NOW FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM THEIR HOME IN CAROLINA AND WOULD BE GLAD TO GET SITUATIONS WITHOUT GOING FAR FROM HERE
SHE HAD ESCAPED FROM HER OWNER TWO AND A HALF YEARS PRIOR TO COMING INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE AND HAD BEEN LIVING IN PENNSYLVANIA PRETTY SECURELY AS SHE HAD SUPPOSED BUT SHE HAD BEEN AWAKENED TO A SENSE OF HER DANGER BY WELL GROUNDED REPORTS THAT SHE WAS PURSUED BY HER CLAIMANT AND WOULD BE LIKELY TO BE CAPTURED IF SHE TARRIED SHORT OF CANADA
MR BROWN STATED TO ME THAT HE HAD HEARD FROM MY WIFE BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHAT WAY HE HEARD
THE SCREAMS OF MRS MILLER AND HER CHILDREN SOON BROUGHT THE HUSBAND AND FATHER TO THE RESCUE
THE INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED LAST EVENING REPRESENTS THE COUNTRY FOR MILES AROUND TO BE IN AS MUCH EXCITEMENT AS AT ANY TIME SINCE THE HORRIBLE DEED WAS COMMITTED
HE GOT IT
HE HAD SOME YEARS BEFORE BEEN ACTIVE IN PREPARING A MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS ASKING THAT BODY TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO PUT AN END TO SLAVERY IN THE STATES BY OFFERING FROM THE NATIONAL TREASURY TO ANY STATE OR STATES WHICH WOULD EMANCIPATE THE SLAVES THEREIN AND ENGAGE NOT TO RENEW THE SYSTEM COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES THUS SUSTAINED
THEY CAME INTO WILMINGTON ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE 27TH AND LEFT THERE IN THE TOWN THEIR TWO CARRIAGES DRAWN BY TWO HORSES
HE REPORTED THAT HE FLED FROM MR JOHN TILGHMAN FOSTER A FARMER LIVING IN THE VICINITY OF RICHMOND
CHARITY WAS NOT TO HIM A DUTY BUT A DELIGHT
JOHNS LYDIA ANN 485
SEVERAL COLORED MEN WERE WOUNDED BUT NONE SEVERELY
HE WOULD HAVE HIS SPREES AFTER MOLLY LEFT HIM
MOBILE JULY 5 1871
THE CONDUCTOR THEN HOISTED ALL THE WINDOWS TOOK OUT THE CUSHIONS AND UNHITCHED THE HORSES
TO SUCH A POWER MY FATHER'S NATURE WAS QUICKLY RESPONSIVE
FIVE PASSENGERS 1857
HER FLIGHT FOR LIBERTY COST HER HER HUSBAND AS SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND
I GOT A SITUATION IMMEDIATELY AT THE KERBY HOUSE BY THE INFLUENCE OF MY FRIEND AND BROTHER STEPNEY BROWN WHO I MUST SAY HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AS ALSO HAVE THE PEOPLE OF BRANTFORD
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE CHURCH AND SO THEY LIT FIRES OUTSIDE AND WE GATHERED OR AT LEAST A NUMBER OF US AROUND THE FIRE
THUS WHILE THESE OPPOSING AGENCIES WERE HOTLY CONTESTING THE RIGHTS OF MAN JAMES MILLER MCKIM AS ONE OF THE EARLIEST MOST FAITHFUL AND ABLEST ABOLITIONISTS IN PENNSYLVANIA OCCUPIED A POSITION OF INFLUENCE LABOR AND USEFULNESS SCARCELY SECOND TO MR GARRISON
THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FOUR WERE ALL YOUNG AND LIKELY
MISS GORDON WAS GETTING OLD AND JOE NOTICED THAT THE YOUNG TRIBE OF NEPHEWS AND NIECES WAS MULTIPLYING IN LARGE NUMBERS
WHEN HE HAD THUS DETERMINED THE OBJECT WAS HALF ACCOMPLISHED
WASHINGTON D.C NOVEMBER 10TH 1855
WILL YOU RECOLLECT HEREAFTER THAT IN ANY OF MY FUTURE LETTERS IN WHICH I MAY USE WHATEVER WORDS MAY BE WITHIN THE BRACKETS ARE INTENDED TO HAVE NO SIGNIFICATION WHATEVER TO YOU ONLY TO BLIND THE EYES OF THE UNINITIATED
ABOUT THE 1ST OF MARCH 1855 MARY WAS PRESENTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
WHEN THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE PIOUS CHRISTIAN COULD USE THE SALUTATION OF BROTHER AND THE PHYSICIAN AND DIVINE BE AS ONE MAN
BEFORE HE WAS READY TO TAKE HIS DEGREE HIS MIND WAS POWERFULLY TURNED TOWARDS RELIGION AND HE RELINQUISHED MEDICINE FOR THE STUDY OF DIVINITY ENTERING THE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY AT PRINCETON IN THE FALL OF 1831 AND A YEAR LATER BEING MATRICULATED AT ANDOVER
THEY WERE THE SO CALLED PROPERTY OF JOHN ENNIS OF GEORGETOWN DELAWARE
AS EVER YOUR FRIEND THOS
THIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTE HE REGARDED NOT AS THE BIRTH-RIGHT OF FRIENDS ALONE NOT OF ONE RACE SEX OR CLASS BUT OF ALL MANKIND
BOTH WERE SLAVES AND OWNED BY E.P
ON MOTION SAMUEL NICKLESS WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN AND WILLIAM STILL SECRETARY
FROM HIS INFANCY UP TO THE HOUR OF HIS ESCAPE NOT A BREATH OF FREE AIR HAD HE EVER BEEN PERMITTED TO BREATHE
SILAS LONG AND SOLOMON LIGHT
D.P
WATKINS AND OTHERS WERE WITH US LAST WEEK
HERE SOME OF THE PASSENGERS WERE KEPT FOR SEVERAL DAYS STRICTLY PRIVATE LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE THE SLAVE-HUNTERS FULL OPPORTUNITY TO TIRE THEMSELVES AND GIVE UP THE CHASE IN DESPAIR
AFTER THE WRITER OF THAT EPISTLE HAS DESCRIBED THE GREAT MEN AND FATHERS OF THE NATION HE SAYS
WILLIAM IS THIRTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF MEDIUM SIZE AND SUBSTANTIAL APPEARANCE
UNDER THE NEW WIFE AND MISTRESS SUSAN FOUND A VERY MARKED CHANGE FOR THE WORSE
HENDERSON ELIZA 459
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER RUNAWAY.--$200 REWARD WILL BE GIVEN IF TAKEN IN THE STATE AND $500 IF TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE
LEVIN HOLDEN HAVING BEEN SOLD ONLY A FEW WEEKS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE WAS SO AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE WHICH AWAITED HIM THAT HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY LED TO SEEK THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE
WOULD STINT THEM SHAMEFULLY IN CLOTHING AND FOOD THOUGH THEY DID NOT GET FLOGGED QUITE AS OFTEN AS SOME OTHERS ON NEIGHBORING PLANTATIONS
THEY AVOWEDLY HELD ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENTS BUT THIS WAS THE BEGINNING AND END OF THEIR OFFENDING
HE IS A TRUE MAN AND A FORWARDER OF SLAVES
THE RESULT WAS THAT HE WAS LEFT TO PURSUE HIS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD JOURNEY WITHOUT FURTHER MOLESTATION
THE TIME AND LABOR EXPENDED BY THOMAS SHIPLEY IN PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF HIS COLORED CLIENTS WOULD BE ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO THOSE WHO WERE NOT AWARE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE
WOODEN ALIAS WM
I WILL GIVE $125 IF TAKEN IN ANNE ARUNDEL PRINCE GEORGE'S CALVERT OR MONTGOMERY COUNTY $150 IF TAKEN IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE
ONE MAN SAID OF SOME WOMEN THAT A MAN MUST LEAVE THEM OR WHIP THEM
I.E
JUDGING FROM HIS EXPRESSIONS AND APPARENT FEELINGS AGAINST HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDURE MANY YEARS OF SUFFERING IN CANADA SNOWS BEFORE HE WOULD APPLY TO THEM FOR CARE AND PROTECTION
I HOPE THAT YOURSELF WIFE AND FAMILY ARE ALL QUITE WELL
YOU WILL TELL FRIEND B
IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO LISTEN TO THEIR TALES OF OUTRAGE AND WRONG WITH COMPOSURE
ONLY ONE OBSTACLE STOOD IN HIS WAY--MATERIAL AID
YORK FOR DANIEL ROBERTSON CAME TO HAND ON THE 31ST ULT
MY DEAR WIFE I NOW EMBRACE THIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING A FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM WELL AT PRESENT ENGOYING GOOD HEALTH AND HOPE THAT THESE FEW LINES MAY FIND YOU WELL ALSO

MR STILL I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHARE ABRAHAM HARRIS IS AS I SHOULD BE AS GLAD TO SEE HIM AS WELL AS ANY OF MY OWN BROTHERS
IT WAS EMINENTLY JUST THAT SUCH A RECORD OF ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PHASES OF THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SLAVERY SHOULD BE PREPARED THAT THE MEMORY OF THE NOBLE ORIGINATORS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE RAILROAD MIGHT BE KEPT GREEN AND POSTERITY ENABLED TO FORM A TRUE CONCEPTION OF THE NECESSITY THAT CALLED IT INTO EXISTENCE AND OF THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH ITS WORK WAS PERFORMED
AFTER THE REST NEEDED BY ONE WHO HAD SUFFERED SO SEVERELY UNTIL HER ARRIVAL IN PHILADELPHIA SHE WAS FORWARDED TO HER ANXIOUSLY WAITING HUSBAND IN NEW BEDFORD WHERE SHE WAS GLADLY RECEIVED
BEFORE LEAVING I HAD THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING A PROTEST AGAINST THAT SOCIETY AS AN OBSTRUCTION TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND CONSEQUENTLY AS UNDESERVING OF BRITISH CONFIDENCE AND PATRONAGE SIGNED BY WILLIAM WILBERFORCE THOMAS FOWELL BUXTON ZACHARY MACAULAY AND OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS PHILANTHROPISTS
GEORGE WASHINGTON GOOSEBERRY ALIAS ISAAC STOUT ALSO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE HOLIDAYS TO SEPARATE FROM HIS OLD MASTER ANTHONY RYBOLD A FARMER LIVING NEAR NEWCASTLE DELAWARE
LEWIS AT ONCE AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS OFFER AND MADE HIS ARRANGEMENTS ACCORDINGLY
THE AUCTION-BLOCK WAS NOT THE ONLY PUNISHMENT SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ENDURE FOR HER FIDELITY TO HER WOMANHOOD FOR RESISTANCE TO HER MASTER BUT BEFORE BEING SOLD SHE WAS CRUELLY SCOURGED
SHE MET ME WITH A MULE-ROPE AND ORDERED ME TO CROSS MY HANDS
HOPING YOU WILL REPLY SOON I REMAIN SIR RESPECTFULLY YOURS AGNES WILLIS
THAT HE WAS AN OLD MAN PRETTY GREY VERY LONG HAIR
ABOLITIONISTS EMISSARIES AND INCENDIARIES WERE FARTHER BELOW PAR THAN EVER
ON ARRIVING AT MAJORITY ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF THIS LAD'S FATHER HE WAS TO HAVE POSSESSION OF HARRISON AS HIS PORTION
ONE OF THE MEN REPLIED THAT FOUR NEGROES WERE ON THE MOW AND HE KNEW OF IT
HE DIED JANUARY 26 1868 HAVING NEARLY COMPLETED HIS 80TH YEAR
WILLIAMSON'S OFFICE SEVENTH AND ARCH FOUND HIM AT HIS DESK AND GAVE IT TO HIM AND AFTER READING IT HE REMARKED THAT HE COULD NOT GO DOWN AS HE HAD TO GO TO HARRISBURG THAT NIGHT ON BUSINESS--BUT HE ADVISED ME TO GO AND TO GET THE NAMES OF THE SLAVE-HOLDER AND THE SLAVES IN ORDER TO TELEGRAPH TO NEW YORK TO HAVE THEM ARRESTED THERE AS NO TIME REMAINED TO PROCURE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS HERE
TO DIE RATHER THAN REMAIN A SLAVE WAS HIS RESOLVE

HAVANA JAN
I FELT WRETCHED SHE SAID WITH EMPHASIS WHEN I HEARD THAT NANCY HAD BEEN SOLD WHICH WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER SHE HAD BEEN REMOVED
AND TO HIS VIGILANCE AND FIDELITY IN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS OF ANTI-SLAVERY WORK IN WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED AND ESPECIALLY IN THAT DEPARTMENT USUALLY CALLED THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD WE GLADLY AVAIL OURSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC AN AUTHENTIC AND INTERESTING HISTORY OF THIS ENTERPRISE
HIS DUTIES HAD BEEN CONFINED TO THE HOUSE AND NOT TO THE SLAVE PEN
NIXON ISAIAH 260
FOR BEING PUT IN JAIL FOR SALE THE 7TH OF LAST JANUARY
FOR SOME REASON UNKNOWN TO JOSEPH WITHIN THE TIME JUST ALLUDED TO HE HAD SOLD ALL HIS SLAVES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIMSELF
STUNNING AND DISCOURAGING AS THIS HORRIBLE ENDING WAS TO ALL CONCERNED AND SERIOUS AS THE MATTER LOOKED IN THE EYES OF PETER'S FRIENDS WITH REGARD TO PETER'S FAMILY HE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT ABANDON THE IDEA OF RESCUING THEM FROM THE JAWS OF THE DESTROYER
BEING HIMSELF THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK HE WAS AWAKENED TO INQUIRE HOW HE COULD ESCAPE THE DANGER AND VERY SOON LEARNED THAT BY FOLLOWING THE OLD METHODS WHICH HAD BEEN USED BY MANY BEFORE HIM RESOLUTION AND PERSEVERANCE HE MIGHT GAIN THE VICTORY OVER MASTER AND OVERSEERS
HE WAS AN ANTI-SLAVERY MAN ALMOST BEFORE SUCH A THING AS ANTI-SLAVERY WAS KNOWN
IN THE MEAN TIME THE MEN ARE CHOPPING WOOD AND THE LADIES ARE GETTING PLENTY SEWING
THE FACTS IN HIS CASE WERE INCONTESTABLY ESTABLISHED IN THE PHILADELPHIA REGISTER IN APRIL 1854 FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING THRILLING ACCOUNT IS TAKEN
SAMUEL NICKLESS CHAIRMAN
PLEASE FORWARD TO DR H
HE SATISFIED THE COMMITTEE THAT HE FULLY BELIEVED IN FREEDOM AND HAD PROVED HIS FAITH BY HIS WORKS AS HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH PURSUERS WHOM HE PUT TO FLIGHT BY THE USE OF AN UGLY-LOOKING KNIFE WHICH HE PLUNGED INTO ONE OF THEM PRODUCING QUITE A PANIC
SMITH JOHN 439
LETTER FROM SAMUEL W
AND THOSE TOO WHO ARE NOT CALLED RICH MIGHT IF THERE WAS ONLY A WILLING MIND GIVE TOO OF THEIR ABUNDANCE
SMITH WAS ARRESTED IMPRISONED AND WAS CALLED UPON TO SUFFER SEVERELY AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE SUBJOINED CORRESPONDENCE TAKEN FROM THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE SOON AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM THE PENITENTIARY
WHEN SPOKEN TO REPLIES QUICKLY
NOT EVEN WAS HE AT LIBERTY TO BREAK HIS MIND TO HIS WIFE AND CHILD FEARING THAT IT WOULD DO THEM NO GOOD AND MIGHT PROVE HIS UTTER FAILURE
SAMUEL PATTISON'S LETTER
IN SO DOING THEY MANAGED TO GET RID OF MOST ALL OF THAT SPECIAL CLASS UPON WHOM THE PROSECUTION DEPENDED FOR A CONVICTION
I HOPE TO MEET YOU ALL AGAIN IF NOT ON EARTH MAY WE SO LIVE THAT WE SHALL MEET IN THAT HAPPY LAND WHERE TEARS AND PARTINGS ARE NOT KNOWN
A WOMAN MAY BE 40 YEARS OLD $40.00 2
FROM A BOY OF NINE UP TO THE TIME I WAS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN I DON'T RECKON HE WHIPPED ME LESS THAN A HUNDRED TIMES
I WOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO SEE YOU ALL BUT NEVER DO I EXPECT TO SEE YOU IN THE UNITED STATES
THIS MAGNANIMOUS RULE OF GIVING THE GOLD DOLLAR WAS ADOPTED BY HER SHORTLY AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW WHICH DAILY VEXED HER RIGHTEOUS SOUL AND WAS KEPT UP AS LONG AS SHE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE HER HOUSE WHICH WAS WITHIN A SHORT TIME OF HER DEATH
ON REACHING BALTIMORE HOWEVER JAMES CAREFULLY STEERED CLEAR OF ALL SLAVE-HOLDERS AND SHREWDLY TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE MATTER OF GETTING AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TICKET FOR CANADA
IN SPEECH MANNERS AND WHOLE APPEARANCE HE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE
SHE WAS WORSE THAN THE OLD BOY WANTED HER TO BE A MORE CONTRARY WOMAN NEVER WAS
23D 1864
HER FORM IS DELICATE HER HANDS DAINTILY SMALL
HE BELONGED TO MISS CATHARINE CORNWELL OF VIANA
MY MAIDEN LECTURE WAS MONDAY NIGHT IN NEW BEDFORD ON THE ELEVATION AND EDUCATION OF OUR PEOPLE
EXACTLY WHERE TO LOOK OR HOW TO FIND HER HE COULD NOT TELL
SHE LEFT TWO BROTHERS AND HER FATHER BEHIND
SALEM 8TH MO 1ST
HARPER THE WELL-KNOWN COLORED ORATOR TO A FRIEND MR WM
OVER HIM THEREFORE THE GREAT CONTEST WAS TO BE MADE
I SINCERELY SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU AND ALL YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN YOUR MOURNFUL BEREAVEMENT
AND I HAVE KEPT WITHIN MY HEART HIS NAME AND THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN EVERY STEP WHICH HE HAS TAKEN
HENRY COULD FIND NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH TREATMENT
BEING INVITED TO TELL HIS OWN STORY DESCRIBE HIS MASTER ETC HE UNHESITATINGLY RELIEVED HIMSELF SOMEWHAT AFTER THIS MANNER
BUT IT IS THEIR HONEST PURPOSE TO STAND BY THE ENGAGEMENTS ALL THE ENGAGEMENTS WHICH BIND THEM TO THEIR BRETHREN OF THE OTHER STATES
HE ORDERED ME TO CROSS MY HANDS
THEY WERE WEALTHY AND COURTED THE GOOD OPINION OF SOCIETY
IT WAS ENTITLED THE MARTYR AGE OF THE UNITED STATES THE PAPER INTRODUCED TO THE ENGLISH PUBLIC THE GREAT NAMES WHICH WERE APPEARING ON THE SCENE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CAUSE IN AMERICA
HE AGREED HOWEVER TO STAND BY HER IN HER STRUGGLES WHILE FLEEING AND DID SO FOR WHICH HE DESERVES CREDIT
THE DOCTOR IS AGREEABLE AND SENSIBLE AND DOUBTLESS A TRUE-HEARTED MAN
BIVANS BELINDA 388
DEAR SIR:--I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE BOTH ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH AND HOPE YOU ARE THE SAME
ACCORDINGLY THEREFORE THE HEARING GRAVELY TOOK PLACE AT LANCASTER
REED ISAAC 319
JACK WAS AWARE THAT A TRAP OF THIS KIND WOULD MOST LIKELY BE SET FOR HIM AND THAT THE LARGE QUANTITY OF ANGLO-SAXON BLOOD IN HIS VEINS WOULD NOT SAVE HIM
BUT THE MASTER NOT THE SLAVE WAS BLAMEWORTHY
IF HIS OWN WIFE AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN IN BONDAGE SCARCELY COULD HE HAVE MANIFESTED GREATER SYMPATHY FOR THEM
SPARE MADE
ISAAC CALLS HIMSELF ISAAC DOTSON HE IS ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE STOUT MADE BUT RATHER CHUNKY
ON ARRIVING IN LONDON I RECEIVED A POLITE INVITATION BY LETTER FROM MR BUXTON TO TAKE BREAKFAST WITH HIM
WASHINGTON D.C SEPTEMBER 9TH 1855
HIS OFFENCE IN THIS INSTANCE WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE DESIRED TO SEE HIS WIFE AND STOLE AWAY FROM HIS MASTER'S PLANTATION AND WENT A DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES TO WHERE SHE LIVED TO SEE HER
JUST TO THINK THAT FROM THE RAINBOW-CROWNED NIAGARA TO THE SWOLLEN WATERS OF THE MEXICAN GULF FROM THE RESTLESS MURMUR OF THE ATLANTIC TO THE CEASELESS ROAR OF THE PACIFIC THE POOR HALF-STARVED FLYING FUGITIVE HAS NO RESTING-PLACE FOR THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT WHILST HESITATING WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE BEST TO CONTINUE TEACHING SHE WROTE TO A FRIEND FOR ADVICE AS FOLLOWS
HE HAS NOT YET SOLD ANY OF THE SLAVES BUT HAS THREATENED TO SELL ALL HANDS TO THE TRADER JENNY ONCE HAD A HUSBAND BUT HE WENT TO CANADA AND THAT WAS ALL SHE COULD TELL ABOUT HIM AS SHE HAD NEVER HAD A LETTER OR ANY DIRECT INFORMATION FROM HIM SINCE HE LEFT
WILLIAM MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS A GOOD-LOOKING MULATTO THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE AND CAPABLE OF THINKING FOR HIMSELF
WHY LET ME ASK IS NOT THE FULL LIGHT ALLOWED TO SHINE ON THIS CASE
JOIN US TO PLACE JUST MEN IN ALL OUR PUBLIC OFFICES
THEY HAD LIVED WITH MASSEY FIVE YEARS UP TO THE LAST MARCH PRIOR TO THEIR ESCAPE HAVING BEEN BOUGHT OUT OF THE BALTIMORE SLAVE-PEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE TO BE FREE AT THE EXPIRATION OF FIVE YEARS SERVICE UNDER HIM
SO WHEN THE WITNESSES AGAINST HER SWORE THAT SHE HAD NO PARTICULAR MARK DAVID PAUL BROWN MADE THEM CLINCH THIS PART OF THEIR TESTIMONY IRREVOCABLY
A MAN WAS KIDNAPPED ALMOST UNDER THE SHADOW OF OUR CAPITAL
MR GARNETT'S WAYS AND MANNERS WERE NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASING TO HIM
I DO NOT INTEND TO PUT ANYTHING OF A PRIVATE CHARACTER INTO PRINT
IT WAS SOON DECIDED BY THE AID OF A VOLUNTEER LAWYER WHOSE SONS HAVE SINCE FOUGHT THE BATTLE FOR FREEDOM THAT THE SLAVE-OWNER HAD A RIGHT TO TAKE HIS SLAVE WHEREEVER AND IN WHATEVER WAY HE PLEASED THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT AT HIS CALL FOR HELP IT WAS THE BOUNDEN DUTY OF EVERY MAN CALLED UPON TO AID HIM

BESIDES THE UNDERGROUND TRAIN THAT MORNING WAS ABOUT THREE HOURS BEHIND TIME
HE WAS OWNED BY DR WILLIAM STEWART OF KING GEORGE'S COURT HOUSE MARYLAND
I HOPE AND PRAY YOU WILL HELP ME AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
HE HAD A VERY LIVELY HOPE OF FINDING HIS WIFE IN FREEDOM SHE HAVING ESCAPED THE PREVIOUS SPRING
CUMMINGS AND JOHN WILSON OF THE SAME PLACE ARE UNDERSTOOD TO BE HERE ON A SIMILAR ERRAND
TRULY A SMALL SUM FOR A HARD-WORKING MAN WITH A FAMILY--YET THIS WAS FAR MORE THAN MANY SLAVES RECEIVED FROM THEIR MASTERS
I THANK YOU FOR THE BRAVE WORDS YOU HAVE SPOKEN
BUT ALAS FOR SOUTHERN IRREGULARITY TWO OR THREE DAYS DELAY AFTER BEING ADVERTISED TO START WAS NO UNCOMMON CIRCUMSTANCE WITH STEAMERS
FOR INSTANCE IN DESCRIBING ISAAC MR THOMAS B

AFTER THEY COULD GET NO MORE WORK OUT OF HIM THEY SAID LET HIM DIE HE IS OF NO SERVICE
EGLIN CHARLOTTE 214

FLEEING FROM DAVIS A NEGRO TRADER SECRETED UNDER A HOTEL UP A TREE UNDER A FLOOR IN A THICKET ON A STEAMER
DETERMINED AT LEAST NOT TO BE TAKEN BACK TO BONDAGE ALIVE
AND IN THE FULNESS OF TIME THE NATION PAID EVEN IN MONEY MANY TIMES ANY POSSIBLE PRICE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEMANDED UNDER THIS PLAN
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND IN COLOR WAS OF A VERY DARK HUE
SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND 1859 AND OTHER PLACES
HE WENT OVER HAD AN INTERVIEW FOUND FROM THEIR STATEMENT THAT FOUR OF THE PARTY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY FREE AND RETURNED TO THIS CITY
REMOVING IN EARLY MANHOOD TO MARYLAND WHERE NEGRO SLAVERY WAS LEGALLY PROTECTED HE BECAME ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE OPPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM BEING A FRIEND AND CO-LABORER OF ELISHA TYSON KNOWN AND BELOVED AS FATHER TYSON BY ALL THE SLAVES OF THE REGION AND TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AS ONE OF THE MOST PHILANTHROPIC OF MEN
BUT THA TOUR OUT THE WINDERS AND JUMP OUT SO CUM BACK TO CAMDEN
THE CASE OF EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS CLAIMED AS A FUGITIVE SLAVE UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE-LAW AFTER HAVING LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS

ON HIS WAY TO CANADA HE WROTE TO THE GOVERNOR FROM ROCHESTER THAT HE NEED PUT HIMSELF TO NO TROUBLE IN HUNTING HIM UP AS HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO VISIT CANADA SHE THOUGHT THAT JOHN WAS RATHER NAUGHTY TO WRITE THUS TO HER PAPA NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS DISPOSED TO FORGIVE HIM AFTER SHE HAD FRANKLY SPOKEN HER MIND

COMPELLED TO PART COMPANY WITH LUNDY TO WHOM HE HAS EVER OWNED HIS MORAL INDEBTEDNESS MR GARRISON AT LENGTH STARTED IN BOSTON IN JANUARY 1831 HIS LIBERATOR WITH LITTLE ELSE BESIDES HIS DAUNTLESS SPIRIT AND A PRESS THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH BESET THE BIRTH OF THIS PAPER WERE NEVER ENTIRELY OVERCOME AND ITS PUBLICATION WAS ATTENDED THROUGH ALL THE THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE WITH CONSTANT STRUGGLE AND PRIVATION AND WITH PERSONAL LABOR AT THE PRINTER'S CASE AND OVER THE FORMS WHICH ONLY AN IRON CONSTITUTION COULD HAVE ENDURED
ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
HE GAVE A VERY INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF HIS SO CALLED MISTRESS HOW HE CAME TO LEAVE HER ETC
WILLIAM AND SOME SIX OTHERS OF THE SERVANTS GOT WIND OF THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD STAND A CHANCE OF BEING IN THE MARKET SOON
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT FOUR MEN TWO OF THEM CONSTABLES ONE OF THE OTHER TWO THE OWNER OF ONE OF THE SLAVES WHO HAD BEEN AIDED AWAY BY LEE SEIZED THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE FUGITIVES AND TOOK HER TO THE WOODS WHERE THE FIENDS STRIPPED EVERY PARTICLE OF CLOTHING FROM HER PERSON TIED HER TO A TREE AND ARMED WITH KNIVES COWHIDES AND A SHOVEL SWORE VENGEANCE AGAINST HER DECLARING THEY WOULD KILL HER IF SHE DID NOT TESTIFY AGAINST LEE

MR WHITSON BOWING POLITELY ADDRESSED HER SUBSTANTIALLY THUS

AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-EIGHT HIS PURPOSE TO FREE HIMSELF BY ESCAPING ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED INTO EFFECT ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
CHARLES DULTON ALIAS WILLIAM ROBINSON

I DIDN'T KNOW HER HUSBAND BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED
THIS SCHRINER WAS DESCRIBED AS A LOW CHUNKY MAN WITH GRUM LOOK BIG MOUTH ETC AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN REFORMED CHURCH
THE FACT IS OBVIOUS TO THIS COURT THAT THE RESPONDENT HAS NO PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY OR GAIT
THIS LETTER ONLY SERVED TO INTENSIFY THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN AWAKENED FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED
I NEVER SAW ANY MARKS UPON HER HERE MR BROWN SAID HE WOULD NOT EXAMINE THIS WITNESS FURTHER UNTIL HE HAD CONCLUDED THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS WHO HAD BECOME SICK
DIFFERING WIDELY IN TEMPERAMENT AND MENTAL STRUCTURE THESE TWO MEN WERE HARMONIOUS IN SPIRIT AND A CLOSE BOND OF SYMPATHY AND AFFECTION EXISTED BETWEEN THEM

LAST YEAR HIS WIFE TOOK ON HER HANDS ABOUT 130 ACRES OF LAND AND WITH HER FORCE SHE RAISED ABOUT 107 BALES OF COTTON
HE THEREFORE DECIDED TO GET OFF VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
WHEN GENERAL SHERMAN WAS MAKING HIS VICTORIOUS MARCH THROUGH THAT STATE IT OCCURRED TO ME BUT TOO LATE THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE ACCOMPANIED HIM AND IN PERSON CLAIMED THE REWARD--(LAUGHTER)--BUT I REMEMBERED THAT HAD I DONE SO I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE MY PAY IN CONFEDERATE CURRENCY AND THEREFORE IT WOULD NOT HAVE PAID TRAVELING EXPENSES
JUST AT THIS TIME I FEEL AS IF I WOULD RATHER STEAL HIM THAN TO BUY HIM
IN DEFENSE OF HIS COURSE JACK REFERRED TO THE TREATMENT WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED WHILE IN SERVITUDE UNDER HIS OLD MASTER IN SOMETHING LIKE THE FOLLOWING WORDS
THIS WAS GLORIOUS NEWS TO ANTHONY
NO HEART WAS SO BLACK THAT HE DID NOT AT LEAST TRY THE BALM OF HEALING UPON IT
OF COURSE THE MASTER COULD HAVE A TICKET BUT BONDS WILL HAVE TO BE ENTERED BEFORE YOU CAN GET A TICKET SAID THE TICKET MASTER
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANYBODY SLAVE THAT COULD READ OUR WAY
IN LIEU OF THIS FACT EXCEPT THE ABOVE ALLUSIONS TO THE TRADER'S BUSINESS THIS SKETCH WILL ONLY REFER TO ROBERT'S CONDITION AS A SLAVE AND FINALLY AS A TRAVELER ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
I WAS DIRECTED TO SEND MY LETTER TO THE POST-OFFICE WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE PLACE
IN FACT HE WAS UTTERLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY AND A LONG TIME BEFORE HE LEFT HAD PLANS LAID WITH A VIEW OF ESCAPING
ONE OF THE LAST VISITS WHICH ROUSED THE FLICKERING ANIMATION OF THE DYING PHYSICIAN WAS FROM THIS FRIEND OF MORE VIGOROUS YEARS AND THE VOICE WHICH GAVE FITTING EXPRESSION TO THE WORTH OF THE DEPARTED AT HIS FUNERAL WAS THAT OF ELIJAH F
HARRISON HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HIS CHILDREN WERE TO BE SOLD
AND BOTH HAD LIKEWISE BEEN FROZEN UP ON THE ROUTE FOR WEEKS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE LIVE FREIGHT ON BOARD
I HAVE BEEN THUS PARTICULAR IN MY STATEMENT BECAUSE THE CASE SEEMS TO US ONE OF UNUSUAL DANGER
AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE HAD IT SAID TO ME WITH APPARENTLY THE MOST PERFECT SIMPLICITY WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING SO MUCH ABOUT THE SLAVES
CHARLES WISE ILLUSTRATION
FRIENDS AND STOCKHOLDERS IN ENGLAND USED TO TAKE A GREAT INTEREST IN SEEING HOW THE FINE ARTS IN THESE PARTICULARS WERE ENCOURAGED IN THE SOUTH THE LAND OF CHIVALRY HENRY PREDO
PARKER RACHEL AND ELIZABETH 551
STRAIGHTWAY THE PASSENGERS WERE MADE COMFORTABLE IN EVERY WAY AND THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM SEEMED TO BE BURNING LIKE FIRE SHUT UP IN THE BONES THE APPEARANCE ALONE OF THESE MEN INDICATED THEIR MANHOOD AND WONDERFUL NATURAL ABILITY
I BORROWED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS TO MAKE OUT THE ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
SKINNER THOS
BUT AS YET NO SUCH OPPORTUNITY HAD PRESENTED ITSELF
THE ALDERMAN THEN DECIDED THAT THE CHILD SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE FATHER
OUTFITS WERE LIBERALLY PROVIDED FOR THEM PASSAGES PROCURED AND THEY TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE FOR A HABITATION IN A FOREIGN LAND
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HER HUSBAND
AS WE APPROACHED THE HOUSE HE SAID
AND DOUBLY HEAVY BECOMES THE CRIME OF MURDER IN SUCH A CASE AND DOUBLY SERIOUS THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL WHO HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH THE ACT AS ADVISERS SUGGESTERS COUNTENANCERS OR ACCESSORIES IN ANY WAY WHATEVER IN THOSE DAYS THE PAPER FROM WHICH THIS EXTRACT IS TAKEN REPRESENTED THE WHIG PARTY AND THE MORE MODERATE AND RESPECTABLE CLASS OF CITIZENS
AS THEY FELT THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT BY REMAINING THEY DECIDED TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF ABRAM'S FATHER AND OTHERS AND GO TO CANADA
THE FREQUENT SAD SEPARATIONS OF SUCH MARRIED COUPLES WHERE ONE OR THE OTHER WAS A SLAVE COULD NOT BE OVERLOOKED
HE CONSULTED WILLIAM WHO ALTHOUGH A YOUNG MAN OF ONLY TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE HAD THE HATE OF SLAVERY EXCEEDINGLY STRONG IN HIS HEART AND WAS AT ONCE WILLING TO ACCOMPANY LLOYD--READY TO FACE COLD WEATHER AND START ON A LONG WALK IF FREEDOM COULD BE THUS PURCHASED AND HIS MASTER JOHN HALL THUS DEFEATED
AT ANY RATE THEY MADE VERY DILIGENT SEARCH AT THIS POINT
AFTER ARRIVING THERE HE RETURNED HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR FAVORS RECEIVED C IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER
JOHN WAS BY TRADE A CARPENTER AND WAS CONSIDERED A COMPETENT WORKMAN
THESE YOUNG BONDMEN WHILST WRITHING UNDER THE TORTURES HEAPED UPON THEM RESOLVED AT THE COST OF LIFE TO MAKE A DESPERATE TRIAL FOR FREE LAND
STEWART HENRY 259
HE WAS THEREFORE RANKED WITH FIRST-CLASS STOCK VALUED AT $1,500
BUT THE HEARER WHO MADE THESE DISCLOSURES THE OCCASION FOR UNMEANING COMPLIMENT AS IF HE FANCIED A CRAVING VANITY TO HAVE PROMPTED THEM SOON FOUND HIMSELF REBUKED BY THE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND PLAIN-SPOKEN PATRIARCH
AFTER THIS AFFECTING EVENT HE WAS TAKEN INTO THE FAMILY OF ISAAC BARTRAM WHO HAD MARRIED HIS ELDEST SISTER
BUT WE THINK IT SAFE TO SAY THAT HIS FIDELITY AND DEVOTION TO THE SLAVE ARE NOWHERE MORE FULLY PORTRAYED THAN IN THE APPENDED UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS
HER OWNER OBSERVING THIS APPARENTLY TRANQUIL STATE OF MIND INDICATING THAT SHE SEEMED BETTER CONTENTED THAN EVER CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO LET THE GARRET DOOR REMAIN UNLOCKED AT NIGHT
WE SAW EACH OTHER ONCE AGAIN AFTER SO LONG AN ABSTANCE YOU MAY KNOW WHAT SORT OF METTING IT WAS JOYFUL TIMES OF CORST
ON RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER I DESIRE YOU TO WRITE A FEW LINES TO MY WIFE MARY ATKINS IN THE CARE OF MY FRIEND HENRY LOWEY STATING THAT I AM WELL AND HEARTY AND HOPING THAT SHE IS THE SAME
YOURS VERY TRULY WM
HOW MR POLLOCK CAME BY SARAH IS NOT STATED ON THE RECORDS
THE EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE--ONE OF WHOM OWED HIM AN OLD GRUDGE--MADE HIM ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACT THAT AMONGST CERTAIN OTHERS HE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD
BY FORBIDDING THE UTTERANCE OF A WORD IN THE PULPIT AND BY THE PRESS FOR THE RIGHTS OF MAN
SO DID ISAAC
WE INVITED HIM THE OTHER DAY TO A WORKING-MEN'S TEA PARTY WHERE I HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE TEA FOR THEM
AND BELIEVE ME IN GOING AWAY FROM BOSTON I AM GOING AWAY FROM HIM FOR I HAVE HEARD HE IS LIVING SOMEWHERE NEAR
SCOTT'S NARRATIVE AND AS HIS SUCCESS AND CONSEQUENT FORTUNES HAVE BEEN ALREADY REFERRED TO IT WILL SUFFICE HERE TO MENTION HIM SIMPLY IN CONNECTION WITH TWO CONTESTS THAT HE SUSTAINED WITH THE PREJUDICE THAT SOUGHT TO DRIVE COLORED PEOPLE FROM THE PASSENGER CARS
STILL I FEAR I NEGLECT THE GREAT CONCERNS OF RELIGION AT HOME IN MY OWN HEART IN MY CONGREGATION AND IN THE COMMUNITY
THEY FOLLOWED IN THE NEXT TRAIN
MORGAN THE SUPERINTENDENT FREQUENTLY TESTIFIED IN WRITING AND VERBALLY TO SMITH'S GOOD DEPORTMENT
I HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM THE EIGHTH MAN FROM DOVER BUT TRUST HE IS SAFE
I EXPECTED TO BE KILLED ON THE SPOT BUT I GOT TO THE WOODS AND STAYED TWO DAYS
HIS RESOURCES WITH REGARD TO FOOD AND WATER CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING
IT WAS SAID OF CHARLES LAMB THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN HEAR THE DEVIL ABUSED WITHOUT TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING IN HIS FAVOR AND WITH ALL MRS MOTT'S INTENSE HATRED OF SLAVERY WE DO NOT THINK SHE EVER HAD ONE UNKIND FEELING TOWARD THE SLAVE-HOLDER

I WILL MAKE INQUIRY TO-MORROW MORNING AND IN CASE ANY OTHER DISPOSITION HAS BEEN MADE OF THEM THAN THE ABOVE I WILL WRITE THEE
HE SEEMED TO COMPREHEND SLAVERY IN ALL ITS BEARINGS
I KEPT IT ABOUT ME FOUR DAYS IN MY POCKET
NOT THREE CENTS WOULD I GIVE NOR DO I WANT ANY OF MY FRIENDS TO BUY ME NOT IF THEY COULD GET ME FOR THREE CENTS
NONE BUT ONE WHO HAD BEEN IN SIMILAR STRAITS COULD ENTER INTO HIS FEELINGS
BY THIS TIME THE CAR HAD BEEN STOPPED AND THE WRATH OF THE CONDUCTOR WAS KINDLED PRODIGIOUSLY
THROUGH HIS UNTIRING VIGILANCE MANY VICTIMS HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE HAND OF THE OPPRESSOR WHOSE TITLE TO FREEDOM ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH WAS UNDOUBTED AND MANY OTHERS WHOSE ENSLAVEMENT WAS AT LEAST QUESTIONABLE
AT THIS POINT HENRY LOST ALL TRACE OF THE REST
THE BOYS WILL BE SENT TO A FRIEND AT NORRISTOWN WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING SEATS IN THE LAST TRAIN THAT LEAVES NORRISTOWN TO-MORROW EVENING
THRILLING INCIDENTS HEROIC ADVENTURES AND NOBLE DEEDS OF SELF-SACRIGCE LIGHT UP EVERY PAGE AND WILL ENLIST THE HEARTIEST SYMPATHIES OF ALL GENEROUS SOULS

MY FRIEND:--YOUR KIND LETTER IN REPLY TO MINE ABOUT ARRAH WAS DULY RECEIVED
THAT DEPOT MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO DOWN IF IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE PREVENTED
HERE HE DECIDED TO PASS A DAY IN THE WOODS BUT THE PRIVACY OF THIS PLACE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFACTORY TO CHARLES MIND
BEFORE HER DEATH I HAD HOPED TO BE FREE FOR A LONG TIME AS SOON AS SHE DIED
THE PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT HAGERSTOWN MARYLAND MAY LIKE TO KNOW HOW THESE ARTICLES GOT OFF SO SUCCESSFULLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR ESCAPE HAVING DOUBTLESS CREATED SOME EXCITEMENT IN THAT REGION OF THE COUNTRY
HIS MASTER ISAAC HARRIS HE DENOUNCED AS A DRUNKARD HIS CHIEF EXCUSE FOR ESCAPING WAS BECAUSE HARRIS HAD SOLD HIS ONLY BROTHER HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER IN THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER

GEORGE CUSTUS THE HACKMAN A COLORED MAN WAS COOL SENSIBLE AND RELIABLE IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTY AS WERE THE OTHER PARTIES THEREFORE EVERY THING WAS WELL MANAGED
BELL HARRISON AND DAUGHTER HARRIET ANN 223
SHE WAS REGARDED AS HAVING BEEN EXCEEDINGLY FORTUNATE IN HAVING RESCUED HERSELF AND CHILD FROM THE HORRID FATE OF SLAVES
SHE PLEADED THAT SHE COULD NOT GET THROUGH HER FELLOW-SUFFERERS SAID THAT SHE MUST BE GOT THROUGH URGING THE MATTER ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE GREAT DANGER TO FACE
IT IS DUE TO CANDOR HOWEVER TO SAY THAT SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED VERY ROUGHLY BY MR MCPHERSON
TWO OF HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHER BY HER OWNER AS WAS USUAL WITH SLAVE-HOLDERS WHICH PREYED SO SEVERELY ON THE POOR FATHER'S MIND THAT IT DROVE HIM INTO A STATE OF HOPELESS INSANITY
ELMIRA JUNE 6TH 1860
P.S.--I DO NOT KNOW IF I SHALL GO THIS FALL OR IN THE SPRING
ON THESE POINTS THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS NARRATIONS MAY BE FOUND ANNEXED
THOUGH HE RARELY ADDRESSED PUBLIC MEETINGS HIS PRESENCE IMPARTED MUCH STRENGTH TO OTHERS WAS WEIGHTY IN THE BEST QUAKER SENSE
BY A LITTLE GOOD MANAGEMENT BERTHS WERE PROCURED FOR THEM ON ONE OF THE RICHMOND STEAMERS BERTHS NOT KNOWN TO THE OFFICERS OF THE BOAT AND THEY WERE SAFELY LANDED IN THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND A MOST AGREEABLE INTERVIEW WAS HAD
WE MIGHT LEAD THEM INTO GREEN PASTURES AND STILL WATERS INTO THE GLORIOUS LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST DIED TO MAKE ALL MEN FREE THE LIBERTY OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD
HE WAS ONE OF NATURE'S NOBLEMEN
IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THIS HEAVY LOAD BY SHREWD MANAGEMENT HE GAINED ACCESS TO THE KIND-HEARTED CAPTAIN AND PROCURED AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TICKET
CHARLES CONNOR THE THIRD PERSON IN THE PARTY WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE--FAST COLOR AND A TOUGH-LOOKING ARTICLE WHO WOULD HAVE BROUGHT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE IN THE HANDS OF A BALTIMORE TRADER
THIS IS WHAT MADE ME LEAVE

WASHINGTON HENRY 334
IN PUTTING INTO EXECUTION HIS BOLD RESOLVE HE SECRETED HIMSELF AND SO REMAINED FOR THREE WEEKS
LAST EVENING I VISITED ONE OF THE PLANTATIONS AND HAD AN INTERESTING TIME
SINCE I GAVE THEM TO HER SHE HAS CONCLUDED TO STAY WHERE SHE IS TILL 7TH DAY NIGHT WHEN COMEGYS MUNSON SAYS HE CAN LEAVE HIS WORK AND WILL GO WITH HER TO THY HOUSE
AFTER DUE ASSISTANCE HE WAS REGULARLY FORWARDED ON TO CANADA
IN REFLECTING UPON THE COURSE WHICH SHE WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE IN ORDER TO FREE HERSELF FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE SHE FELT MORE KEENLY THAN EVER FOR HER LITTLE CHILDREN AND READILY IMAGINED HOW SADLY SHE WOULD MOURN WHILE THINKING OF THEM HUNDREDS OF MILES DISTANT GROWING UP ONLY TO BE SLAVES
THE LETTER REQUESTED ME TO FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM WARNING
THE INTENSE AND DEEP ANXIETY I FELT ABOUT THEM FOR WEEKS BEFORE I HEARD OF THEIR CAPTURE IN INDIANA AND THEN IT SEEMED TOO MUCH TO BEAR
I SHOULD THINK THEY HAVE STOPPED TO-DAY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RAIN AND MOST LIKELY WILL ARRIVE SAFE TO-MORROW
WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVED TO START AS BRAVE MEN USUALLY DO HENRY HAVING COUNTED ALL THE COST WAS IN HIS PLACE ON THE BOAT WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS CANADA
ON THIRD DAY MORNING ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THEY BROKE JAIL
WHETHER THE GOVERNOR WAS MOVED BY THIS CONSIDERATION OR BY THE FASCINATING CHARMS OF MRS JORDON OR BOTH WILLIAM WAS NOT ABLE TO DECIDE

HE WAS FROM SNOWHILL WORCESTER COUNTY MD AND HAD ESCAPED FROM JAMES PURNELL A FARMER OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPEAK VERY FAVORABLY
NEVERTHELESS IN SOME CASES IT WOULD SEEM NECESSARY TO ADMONISH HER NOT TO BE QUITE SO LIBERAL
MARY ARRIVED WITH HER TWO CHILDREN IN THE EARLY SPRING OF 1854
MR WHEELER WENT TO DINNER
MASSA WAS DRUNK
INDEED THE ENTIRE BAND EVINCED SIMILAR FEELINGS
IN DUE TIME A GOOD PROVIDENCE OPENED THE WAY AND TO SAM'S SATISFACTION HE REACHED PHILADELPHIA HAVING ENCOUNTERED NO PECULIAR DIFFICULTIES

I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MIRACLE-WORKING POWER THAT I COULD GIVE WINGS TO THEM ALL SO THAT THEY COULD COME FASTER THAN BY RAILROADS EITHER UNDERGROUND OR ABOVE
BUT THEY REMAINED STEADFAST OFT AS THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE MAKING THE LAST STROKE WITH THEIR OARS ON THE VERGE OF BEING OVERWHELMED WITH THE WAVES
AS MR JONES MAY BE UNAWARE WHICH WAY HIS MAN TOM TRAVELED THIS ITEM MAY INFORM HIM THAT HIS NAME WAS ENTERED ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BOOK APRIL 4TH 1856 AT WHICH DATE HE APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND FULL OF HOPE FOR A SAFE SOJOURN IN CANADA
STILL--DEAR SIR:--I RECEIVED YOURS DATED MAY 6TH AND WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU
WHILE HER FORMER MISTRESS HAS BEEN TO HER FOR HELP
HE WAS PROUDER THAT THIS SINGLE COMMUNITY SHOULD CALL HIM ABOLITIONIST THOUGH IT SPAT THE WORD AT HIM THAN IF THE WHOLE EARTH SHOULD HAIL HIM WITH THE KINGLIEST TITLE
ALSO HOW COMES ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
FOR HIMSELF HE WAS HIGHLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MINISTER'S NOTIONS OF FREEDOM AS HE HAD HEARD SO MANY HIGH NOTIONS OF SLAVERY
MANSFIELD EXPRESSED ON BEHALF OF ROMULUS COMPANION HIS SAD FEELINGS ON HEARING OF HIS FRIEND'S DEATH
FOR THE LAST TWELVE OR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HIRE HIS TIME FOR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER ANNUM
COME GET YOUR HAT AND COME WITH US WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU THE POOR FELLOW WAS BY THIS TIME THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED AND REALLY THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN PURSUED
BUT COMING FROM SUCH A SOURCE IT WILL LINGER IN OUR MEMORY WHILE LIFE AND ITS SCENES SHALL LAST INSPIRING IN US WE HOPE A PURER AND A MORE ARDENT DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND HUMANITY
TRUE HE HAD ONLY BEEN TWELVE MONTHS UNDER THE YOKE OF THIS HIGH FUNCTIONARY
STILL:--DEAR SIR--I HAVE LEARNED OF MY FRIEND RICHMOND BOHM THAT MY CLOTHES WERE IN PHILADELPHIA
I CAN BETTER FEEL THAN I HAVE LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE MOURNFUL AND SORROWING PRIDE THAT MUST HAVE STIRRED THE INMOST SOULS OF THOSE MEN OF COLOR WHO HAD THE HONOR CONFERRED ON THEM OF BEARING HIS MORTAL REMAINS TO THEIR LAST RESTING-PLACE WHEN THEY THOUGHT OF WHAT A SACRED TRUST WAS COMMITTED TO THEIR HANDS
THE CAPTAIN SECRETED THEM ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT
ANOTHER BY THE NAME OF SMITH WAS SHOT DEAD IN ONE OF OUR LUMBER YARDS BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO SURRENDER AND HIS PURSUER PERMITTED TO ESCAPE WITHOUT ARREST OR TRIAL

IF THE GENTLEMAN MR R.S IS NOT RUNNING ON THE BOAT NOW YOU CAN GIVE DIRECTIONS TO LUDWILL COBB IN CARE OF MR R
I AM LIVING AT YORKVILLE NEAR TORONTO CANADA WEST
THESE CONTINUAL SCOURGINGS STIRRED THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM IN WESLEY TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO ESCAPE FOR HIS LIFE
THIS METHOD THEREFORE WAS CONSIDERED OUT OF THE QUESTION
BESIDES IT SAVED THE COMMITTEE THE NECESSITY OF WRITING OUT A DESCRIPTION OF THEM THE ONLY FAULT FOUND WITH THE ADVERTISEMENT BEING IN REFERENCE TO THEIR AGES
THE COMMITTEE FINDING THEM IN NEED HAD THE PLEASURE OF FURNISHING THEM WITH FOOD MATERIAL AID AND A CARRIAGE WITH CHEERING WORDS AND LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO FRIENDS ON THE ROAD TO CANADA

I HAD SEEN MR CONCKLIN IN CINCINNATI
MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE RISING GENERATION AT LEAST WILL TAKE ENCOURAGEMENT BY HER EXAMPLE AND FIND AN ARGUMENT OF RARE FORCE IN FAVOR OF MENTAL AND MORAL EQUALITY AND ABOVE ALL BE AWAKENED TO SEE HOW PREJUDICES AND DIFFICULTIES MAY BE SURMOUNTED BY CONTINUAL STRUGGLES INTELLIGENCE AND A VIRTUOUS CHARACTER
BUT ALL APPREHENSION OF DANGER DID NOT NOW DISAPPEAR FOR THERE WAS NO ROOM TO SUPPOSE THAT ADAMS EXPRESS OFFICE HAD ANY SYMPATHY WITH THE ABOLITIONIST OR THE FUGITIVE CONSEQUENTLY FOR MR MCKIM TO APPEAR PERSONALLY AT THE EXPRESS OFFICE TO GIVE DIRECTIONS WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMING OF A BOX FROM RICHMOND WHICH WOULD BE DIRECTED TO ARCH STREET AND YET NOT INTENDED FOR THAT STREET BUT FOR THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE AT 107 NORTH FIFTH STREET IT NEEDED OF COURSE NO GREAT DISCERNMENT TO FORESEE THAT A STEP OF THIS KIND WAS WHOLLY IMPRACTICABLE AND THAT A MORE INDIRECT AND COVERT METHOD WOULD HAVE TO BE ADOPTED
IF IT MEANS HOLDING UP A GREAT INIQUITY TO LOATHING BY A POWERFUL PEN AND NAILING MORAL COWARDICE WHERE-EVER IT SHOWED

THE STORY OF EACH WAS SO LONG AND SAD THAT A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IN ATTEMPTING TO WRITE IT OUT FOUND THAT THE TWO NARRATIVES WOULD TAKE VOLUMES
WHAT PECULIAR INFLUENCE DID HE EXERT FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE CAUSE WHICH SO LARGELY ABSORBED HIS LABOR AND LIFE
HE WAS SENT TO THE LEGISLATURE OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR FIVE SESSIONS WHERE HE BECAME THE PERSONAL FRIEND OF THE GOVERNOR JOSEPH RITNER AND ALSO OF THADDEUS STEVENS

HOPKINS SIDNEY 493
THAT SLAVERY HAD GIVEN HER ONE CHILD BUT NO HUSBAND AS A PROTECTOR OR A FATHER
BUT WITH REGARD TO CORDELIA
IN EVAN'S OPINION SHE WAS A TOLERABLE GOOD MISTRESS
DR WILLIS BROUGHT THE GRATIFYING INTELLIGENCE THAT THESE BRAVE YOUNG ADVENTURERS FELL INTO THE HANDS OF DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS AND WARM FRIENDS OF FREEDOM
TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS VERY LIKELY-LOOKING SMART ACTIVE AND EXCEEDINGLY ATTENTIVE TO HIS YOUNG MASTER--INDEED HE WAS ALMOST EYES EARS HANDS AND FEET FOR HIM
SHE WAS WELL DRESSED WEARING A RED AND GREEN BLANKET SHAWL AND CARRIED WITH HER A VARIETY OF CLOTHING

STILL DEAR SIR:--I STRONGLY HOPE THE LITTLE MATTER OF BUSINESS SO LONG PENDING AND ABOUT WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN YOU SO MANY TIMES WILL TAKE A MOVE NOW
THE APPEARANCE OF THESE YOUNG MOTHERS AT FIRST PRODUCED A SUDDEN DEGREE OF PLEASURE BUT THEIR STORY OF SUFFERING QUITE AS SUDDENLY CAUSED THE MOST PAINFUL REFLECTIONS

SINCE I REACHED THIS CITY I HAVE TALAGRAPHED TO FRIEND BROWN TO SEND MY THING TO ME BUT I CANNOT HEAR A WORD FROM NO ONE AT ALL
THIS WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE MISTRESS SPITE ANN MARIA HAD ALWAYS DESIRED HER FREEDOM FROM CHILDHOOD AND ALTHOUGH NOT THIRTEEN WHEN FIRST ADVISED TO ESCAPE SHE RECEIVED THE SUGGESTION WITHOUT HESITATION AND EVER AFTER THAT TIME WAITED ALMOST DAILY FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS THE CHANCE TO FLEE

IN MARCH 1857 ABRAM HARRIS FLED FROM JOHN HENRY SUTHERN WHO LIVED NEAR BENEDICT CHARLES COUNTY MD WHERE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THE FARMING BUSINESS AND WAS THE OWNER OF ABOUT SEVENTY HEAD OF SLAVES
THERE HE WORKED AND WAS A LIVE YOUNG MAN INDEED--AMONG THE FOREMOST IN IDEAS AND NOTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM ETC AS MANY LETTERS FROM HIM BORE EVIDENCE
DO BE PLEASED TO WRITE ME IF YOU CAN GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THEM
HE WAS NOT LARGE RATHER BELOW THE ORDINARY SIZE OF A BROWN COLOR AND VERY PLUCKY
HAPPENING TO KNOW A MAN WHO HAD A PISTOL FOR SALE HE WENT TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WISHED TO PURCHASE IT
SO I HAD TO HURRY ON BOARD BRINGING THE LETTER ALONG
AFTER SPENDING A YEAR OR MORE IN MASSACHUSETTS HE HAD A DESIRE TO SEE HOW THE FUGITIVES WERE DOING IN UPPER AND LOWER CANADA AND IF ANY BETTER CHANCES EXISTED IN THESE PARTS FOR MEN OF HIS STAMP

COOL QUIET THOUGHTFUL AND PERFECTLY COMPETENT TO EXECUTE HIS UNDERTAKING
THE EMISSARIES OF AUTHORITY WITH DIFFICULTY FOUND THE OFFICE OF THE LIBERATOR IN A MEAN ROOM WHERE ITS EDITOR WAS AIDED ONLY BY A NEGRO BOY AND SUPPORTED BY A FEW INSIGNIFICANT PERSONS SO THE OFFICERS TERMED THEM OF ALL COLORS
IT IS SAID THAT PARTY OF COLORD PEOPLE DONE IT WHICH PARTY WAS SEEN TO COME OUT AN INFAME HOUSE
I AM SENDING W.S
YOU CAN SEE THE MARK PLAIN ENOUGH--LOOK HERE WITH HIS FINGER ON THE SPOT I LEFT MILLINGTON AT THE HEAD OF CHESTER IN KENT COUNTY MARYLAND WHERE I HAD BEEN HELD BY A FARMER WHO CALLED HIMSELF MICHAEL NEWBOLD
IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FOR HIM HE HAS THE MEANS TO TAKE HIM TO YOUR PLACE

BUT IN TURNING TO ANOTHER EPISTLE DATED BOSTON APRIL 19TH ON THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT WE FEEL THAT A PART OF IT IS TOO INTERESTING TO OMIT

ON APPROACHING THE BANK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISCOVERED MAST THE SCHOONER WAS ALSO DISCOVERED
SHE CAME TO ACCOMPANY THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS WITH HER
THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE U.S
BEFORE RUNNING AWAY HIS GENERAL CHARACTER FOR SOBRIETY INDUSTRY AND RELIGION HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CONSIDERED GOOD BUT IN COVETING HIS FREEDOM AND RUNNING AWAY TO OBTAIN IT HE HAD SUNK FAR BELOW THE UTMOST LIMIT OF FORGIVENESS OR MERCY IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE SLAVE-HOLDERS OF INDIAN CREEK
BENJAMIN WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE CHESTNUT COLOR MEDIUM SIZE AND SHREWD
BUT HE DID NOT LEAVE HIS YOUNG MISTRESS IN THIS WAY WITHOUT GOOD REASONS FOR SO DOING
DEAR SIR WE BOTH WOULD BE VERY GLAD FOR YOU TO ATTEND TO THIS AS WE BOTH DO STAND VERY MUCH IN NEED OF THEM AT THIS TIME

ANOTHER TIME MISTRESS MCCAULLY GOT VERY ANGRY
I THEN STARTED FOR TORONTO ARRIVED THERE SAME DAY AT 12 O'CLOCK
CATHARINES C.W OCTOBER 5TH 1854
SEVERAL LETTERS WERE RECEIVED FROM HER RESPECTING HER PROSPECTS ETC FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT SHE HAD GAINED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER HUSBAND ALTHOUGH NOT OF A SATISFACTORY NATURE

BEFORE BEING SENT AWAY FROM PORTSMOUTH VA WHERE HE WAS TRIED FOR TEN DAYS IN SUCCESSION IN THE PRISON FIVE LASHES A DAY WERE LAID HEAVILY ON HIS BARE BACK
I HAVE NOW ANOTHER L1 TO ADD TO THE LATTER HALF AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE ENCLOSED A L5 NOTE IN THIS ENVELOPE BUT WE ARE RATHER AFRAID OF SENDING THE ACTUAL MONEY IN LETTERS AND OUR LONDON BANKERS DO NOT LIKE TO REMIT SMALL SUMS
FOR IT WAS HER DELIGHT TO SEE THE FUGITIVES INDIVIDUALLY TAKE THEM BY THE HAND AND WARMLY WELCOME THEM TO FREEDOM
SHE WAS A MULATTO AND HER CHILDREN WERE ALMOST FAIR ENOUGH TO PASS FOR WHITE--PROBABLY THEY WERE QUADROONS HARDLY ANY ONE WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THAT THEY HAD ONLY ONE QUARTER OF COLORED BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS
7TH STREET WHERE THE RESURRECTION WAS TO TAKE PLACE
SIR MY PARTICULAR FOR WRITING IS THAT I WISH TO HEAR FROM YOU AND TO HEAR ALL THE NEWS FROM DOWN SOUTH
SAID NEGRO WAS HIRED TO FITZHUGH MAYO TOBACCONIST
SAMUEL RHOADS WAS BORN IN PHILADELPHIA IN 1806 AND WAS THROUGH LIFE A CONSISTENT MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
PEART SENT THREE ON TO NORRISTOWN
SUCH INFORMATION COULD NOT ALWAYS BE OBTAINED FROM THOSE WHOSE LOT HAD BEEN CAST AMONG ORDINARY SLAVE-HOLDERS
IT WAS A VERY SAD AFFAIR
SILAS WAS QUITE BLACK SPARE-BUILT AND ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
HAD BROKEN OUT OF PRISON AND AGAIN ESCAPED
THIS THOMAS DECLARED WAS THE HEAD AND FRONT OF HIS OFFENDING
ANNA DORSET BECAME TIRED OF SLAVERY IN MARYLAND WHERE SHE REPORTED THAT SHE HAD BEEN HELD TO SERVICE BY A SLAVE-HOLDER KNOWN BY THE NAME OF ELI MOLESWORTH
IN SHORT HE WAS PLAINLY TOLD THAT WITHOUT A VERY GREAT CHANCE THE UNDERTAKING WOULD COST HIM HIS LIFE
PASSENGERS FROM MARYLAND
HE KNEW THEIR NUMBERS HE HAD SEEN THE IMPLEMENTS OF DESTRUCTION WHICH THEY WERE BRANDISHING ABOUT THEM AND HE WAS AWARE THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH A CONFLICT WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH THE MOST DISASTROUS RESULTS AND MIGHT BE THE BEGINNING OF HOSTILITIES WHICH WOULD TERMINATE IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WEAKER PARTY OR AT LEAST IN A DREADFUL EFFUSION OF HUMAN BLOOD
CHARLES LEFT HIS WIFE ANNA LIVING NEAR THE HEAD OF SASSAFRAS MD
EDWARD LEWIS
RUFFIANS FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SLAVE-LINE AIDED BY PROFESSIONAL KIDNAPPERS ON OUR OWN SOIL A CLASS OF MEN WHOSE OCCUPATION UNTIL LATELY HAD BEEN GONE ARE CONTINUALLY PROWLING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND EVERY NOW AND THEN SEIZING AND CARRYING AWAY THEIR PREY
MAY GOD SPEED THE FLIGHT OF THE SLAVE AS HE SPEEDS THROUGH OUR REPUBLIC TO GAIN HIS LIBERTY IN A MONARCHICAL LAND
JOE PICTURED HIS MASTER OVERSEERS AND GENERAL TREATMENT OF SLAVES IN NO FAVORABLE LIGHT
AND ALTHOUGH THE RED CLOUDS OF WAR HOVER THICK AROUND US AND VENGEANCE LURKS IN SECRET PLACES I TRUST THROUGH THE GUIDANCE OF AN ALL-WISE DIRECTOR TO STEER SAFELY THROUGH THE ANGRY TIDE THAT NOW SO OFTEN EBBS AND FLOWS AROUND ME
FROM THIS DIRECTION NO GREAT ADVANTAGE IS LIKELY TO ARISE VERY SOON
ANDREW MARY CHARITY MARGARET LEWIS AND SAMUEL ALL SLAVES
HE AND MRS MARIA THOMAS DISAGREED
BEING FAMILIAR WITH SUCH CASES THE COMMITTEE WAS DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE TO OBSERVE HOW WISELY AND SUCCESSFULLY EACH OF THESE PARTIES HAD MANAGED TO OVERCOME THESE DIFFICULTIES
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HE HAS BEEN A CITIZEN OF BOSTON
HE PARTED NOT WITH HIS COMPANION WILLINGLY
OF NATURES KEENLY SENSITIVE THEY HATED SLAVERY FROM THAT HOUR AS ONLY CHILDREN OF SUCH NATURES CAN
AND IN MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH CANADA HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUFFER MANY THINGS
AS IT NOW IS I AM NOT SORRY FOR COMING DOWN ON MY WAY TO ST LOUIS AS FAR AS PADUCAH THERE I LEARNED FROM A COLORED MAN AT THE WHARF THAT THAT SAME DAY IN THE MORNING THE MASTER AND THE FAMILY OF FUGITIVES ARRIVED OFF THE BOAT AND HAD THEN GONE ON THEIR JOURNEY TO TUSCUMBIA BUT THAT THE WHITE MAN MR CONCKLIN HAD GOT AWAY FROM THEM ABOUT TWELVE MILES UP THE RIVER
BUT CHARLES WAS TOO WIDE AWAKE TO BE CAUGHT WITHOUT HIS PASS DAY OR NIGHT
SHE WILL LEAVE NORFOLK ON THE 13TH OF THIS MONTH IN THE STEAMSHIP VIRGINIA FOR PHILADELPHIA YOU WILL OBLIGE ME VERY MUCH BY SEEING HER SAFELY ON THE TRAIN OF CARS THAT LEAVES PHILADELPHIA FOR THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE NIAGARA FALLS PLEAS TO TELL THE LADY TO TELEGRAPH TO ME WHAT TIME SHE WILL LEAVE PHILADELPHIA SO I MAY KNOW WHAT TIME TO MEET HER AT THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE MY BROTHER ISAAC PORMAN SEND HIS LOVE ALSO HIS FAMILY TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY THEY ARE ALL WELL AT PRESENT PLEAS TO GIVE MY RESPECTS TO MR HARRY LONDAY ALSO MISS MARGARET CUNIGAN NO MORE AT PRESENT
THERE WERE TWO OTHERS--BROTHERS OF MATTERSON--WHO WERE TOLD OF OUR PLAN TO ESCAPE AND READILY JOINED WITH US IN THE UNDERTAKING
GEORGE W
THE CASE OF WM
THE IDEA OF BOYS SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED AS THEY WERE BEING THROWN ON THE WORLD GAVE OCCASION FOR SERIOUS REFLECTION
HIS STAY WAS BRIEF BUT INTERESTING
GROSS PETER 474
CONSEQUENTLY HERE ENDED THIS DIFFICULTY
DESPITE ALL THE PRO-SLAVERY TEACHINGS HE HAD LISTENED TO ALL HIS LIFE HE WAS FAR FROM SIDING WITH THE PRO-SLAVERY DOCTRINES
WE HAVE SEEN NO PRAISES OF HER THAT WERE OVERDRAWN
DURING THE FOUR DAYS WAITING FOR THE IMPORTANT SUNDAY MORNING I THOROUGHLY SURVEYED THE ROCKS AND SHOALS OF THE RIVER FROM FLORENCE SEVEN MILES UP WHERE WILL BE MY PLACE OF DEPARTURE
I HOPE THESE WILL BE IN PROCESS OF TIME
ONE OF THE OTHERS HAS BEEN SOME TIME OUT
HE ANSWERED NO IT IS A DARK NIGHT AND A MUDDY ROAD AND NO CONVEYANCE CAN BE GOT TONIGHT I SOON FOUND THAT WE MUST STAY IN CHATHAM UNTIL MONDAY MORNING
PRY SAUNEY 382
MANY DIFFICULTIES WERE SURMOUNTED BEFORE AND AFTER LEAVING RICHMOND BY WHICH THEY EARNED THEIR MERITED SUCCESS
THE PROMISED L4 WERE FOR THE FUGITIVES BEING GATHERED FROM VARIOUS CHRISTIAN FRIENDS WHO GAVE IT ME FOR THEIR PARTICULAR USE
AS THE COUNTIES WERE CALLED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER HE RESPONDED FIRST AMONG THE PENNSYLVANIA DELEGATION
THEY'VE GOT MY MOTHER FOR GOD'S SAKE SAVE ME CRIED EUPHEMIA TO A WOMAN IN THE SECOND STORY WHO WAS AN EYE-WITNESS TO THIS MONSTROUS OUTRAGE
COCHRAN A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
TO TAKE HOLD OF HIM AND SET HIM ASIDE QUICKLY
THE NATIONAL AMERICAN
BUT ON THE OTHER A MORAL DEADNESS IN THE NORTH SO PROFOUND AND DETERMINED THAT IT THREATENED THUS BRUTALLY ANY VOICE THAT WOULD DISTURB IT
BUT I WILL WALK BY FAITH NOT BY SIGHT FOR ALL GROUNDS OF HOPE FOUNDED ON EXTERNAL APPEARANCE HAVE THUS FAR SIGNALLY FAILED AND BROKEN DOWN UNDER ME
SUSAN WAS OF A BRIGHT BROWN COLOR MEDIUM SIZE QUICK AND ACTIVE INTELLECTUALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM SLAVERY AS SHE WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS SHE MIGHT STILL DO SOMETHING FOR HERSELF
GAULT
HE WAS DISPOSED TO SPEAK RATHER FAVORABLY OF HER AT LEAST HE SAID THAT SHE WAS TOLERABLY KIND TO HER SERVANTS
THEY RECOGNIZE NO LAW OF HIGHER SOCIAL OBLIGATION THAN ITS CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS MADE IN PURSUANCE OF IT
NO MONEY TO GET BACK TO PHILADELPHIA
HE WAS INTERESTING NEVERTHELESS
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER PHASE OF HIS CHARACTER WHICH SHOULD BE MENTIONED
BUT OF ALL THE TRIALS WHICH SLAVES HAD TO ENDURE THE SEPARATIONS OF HUSBANDS AND WIVES WERE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO BEAR UP UNDER
SO YOU BE PLEASE TO GIVE HER THIS DIRECTION SHE CAN GET A CAB AND GO TO THE DONEGANA HOTEL AND EDMUND TURNER IS THERE HE WILL TAKE YOU WHERE I LIVES AND IF HE IS NOT THERE CABMAN TAKE YOU TO MR TAYLORS ON DURHAM ST NEARLY OPPOSITE TO THE METHODIST CHURCH

FAITHFUL WORKERS IN THE CAUSE
SO HARD DID SHE FEEL HER LOT TO BE THAT SHE WAS COMPELLED TO RESIGN HER CHILDREN UNCLE AND AUNT TO THE CRUEL MERCY OF SLAVERY
THOSE NEAREST OF KIN TO WHOM HE FELT MOST TENDERLY ALLIED AND FROM WHOM HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO PART WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER
OF HIS BONDAGE AND ESCAPE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS OBTAINED FROM HIM
AND YOUR HANDS WOULD FAIL TO CLEANSE IT THOUGH LAKE ERIE YE SHOULD DRAIN
THREE OUT OF QUITE A NUMBER OF LETTERS RECEIVED FROM THEM FROM TIME TO TIME ARE SUBJOINED
ABRAM WAS ONLY TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE MULATTO FIVE FEET SIX INCHES HIGH INTELLIGENT AND THE PICTURE OF GOOD HEALTH
ACCORDING TO LAW ANNA WAS ENTITLED TO HER FREEDOM BUT UP TO THE TIME OF HER ESCAPE SHE HAD NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO ENJOY THE FAVOR
WE MUST PATIENTLY WAIT AND QUIETLY HOPE
MANY LETTERS FITTED TO AWAKEN VERY DEEP FEELINGS CAME FROM THE MOTHER ABOUT THIS CHILD
HIS APPEARANCE AND SMARTNESS INDICATED RESOLUTION AND GAVE PROMISE OF FUTURE SUCCESS
A HINT TO THE WISE IS SUFFICIENT

IT WAS KNOWN HOWEVER THAT HE NEVER HAD ANY DEED FROM THE ALMIGHTY BUT OPPRESSED THEM WITHOUT ANY JUST RIGHT SO TO DO
HE LEFT HIS PARENTS TWO BROTHERS AND THREE SISTERS ALL SLAVES IN THE HANDS OF PURNELL THE MASTER WHOM HE DESERTED
ONE MORE DAY AND NIGHT MUST ELAPSE ERE HE COULD BE RECEIVED ON BOARD
THEY ARE WILLIAM STILL CHAIRMAN 31 NORTH FIFTH STREET NATHANIEL W

NEWPORT KENTUCKY NOV
IN ORDER TO DRAW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN FREEDOM AND SLAVERY SIMPLY WITH A VIEW OF SHOWING HOW THE POWERS THAT WERE ACTED AND JUDGED IN THE DAYS OF THE REIGN OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW UNQUESTIONABLY NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ISSUE THAN THE CHARGE OF JUDGE KANE COUPLED WITH THE INDICTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY
HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CASH BUT DID NOT RANK HIGH IN SOCIETY
IN THE SECOND PLACE HE ALWAYS THOUGHT SLAVERY WAS WRONG ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER SUFFERED ANY PERSONAL ABUSE TOILING MONTH AFTER MONTH THE YEAR ROUND TO SUPPORT HIS MASTER AND NOT HIMSELF WAS THE ONE INTOLERABLE THOUGHT
DOUBTLESS HE FOUND WHEN HE DISCOVERED GEORGE HAD GONE THAT HE HAD OVERSTOOD THE MARKET THIS WAS WHAT PRODUCED ACTION PROMPT AND DECISIVE ON THE PART OF GEORGE

I ALWAYS THOUGHT WE COLORED PEOPLE OUGHT TO WORK FOR OURSELVES AND WIVES AND CHILDREN LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE COMMITTEE SAW THAT ROBERT'S VIEWS WERE IN EVERY WORD SOUND DOCTRINE AND FOR FURTHER LIGHT ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED AT THE HANDS OF HIS MISTRESS NOT KNOWING BUT THAT HE HAD RECEIVED KINDNESS FROM THE WEAKER VESSEL WHILE ENDURING SUFFERING UNDER HIS MASTER
HE NEVER ALLOWED A DROP OF TEA OR COFFEE OR SUGAR AND IF YOU DIDN'T EAT YOUR BREAKFAST BEFORE DAY HE WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU ANY BUT WOULD DRIVE YOU OUT WITHOUT ANY
OBLEBEE 204
LIBERTY OR DEATH WAS THE WATCHWORD OF THAT AWFUL MOMENT
THOUGH A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH HIS MASTER FLETCHER JACKSON THOUGHT NOTHING OF TAKING THE SHOVEL TO ALFRED'S HEAD
AND THE WORK IS TIMELY FROM THE FRIENDS REVIEW PHILADELPHIA WE ARE GLAD TO SEE THIS BOOK
AND BEFORE I LEFT THE OFFICE THE PARCELS CAME IN EACH ON TWO LEGS
HE WAS DURING CHILDHOOD REMARKABLY FOND OF READING AND WAS DISTINGUISHED AMONG HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES FOR UNCOMMON PERSEVERANCE IN ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK A TRAIT WHICH PECULIARLY MARKED HIM THROUGH LIFE
HAVING LICENSE TO DO AS THEY PLEASED THEY WOULD OF COURSE CARRY THEIR CRUELTIES TO THE MOST EXTREME VERGE OF PUNISHMENT
HE TESTIFIES THAT HE FLED FROM FREDERICA DELAWARE WHERE HE HAD BEEN OWNED BY JOSEPH BROWN
HIS OWN FEELINGS WERE COMMUNICATED TO HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FRIENDS WOULD SEND GIFTS TO THE COMMITTEE'S TREASURY

HE COMPLAINED NOT SO MUCH OF BAD USAGE AS OF THE UTTER DISTASTE HE HAD TO WORKING ALL THE TIME FOR THE WHITE PEOPLE FOR NOTHING HE WAS ALSO DECIDEDLY OF THE OPINION THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS LIBERTY
AND INFORMED THAT MY SERVICES SHOULD ENTITLE ANOTHER SISTER TO HER EDUCATION WITHOUT CHARGE
ARRIVED DRESSED IN MALE ATTIRE
HE WAS NOT SO BAD BUT HIS WIFE WAS SAID TO BE A STINGER CHARLES LEFT HIS MOTHER AND FATHER BEHIND ALSO FOUR SISTERS
IF HE COULD SETTLE THESE TWO POINTS SATISFACTORILY HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING TO ENDURE ANY SACRIFICE FOR THE SAKE OF HIS FREEDOM
WAS MOVED TO ESCAPE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN HIS FREEDOM
DO YOU EVER HAVE ANY UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS NOW
AT THE MOMENT OF RECOGNITION SHE SPRANG UP OVERWHELMING HIM WITH HER MANIFESTATIONS OF DELIGHT CRYING
IN COMPANY WITH THE THREE MEN FOR WHOM THE ABOVE LARGE REWARD WAS OFFERED CAME A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF ELIZA NOKEY
CONSEQUENTLY THE FOLLOWING LETTER IS INSERTED FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH

SAY HAVE YOU AN ARM LIKE GOD THAT YOU HIS WILL OPPOSE
ALL IN GOOD ORDER AND FULL OF HOPE
WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE STATION HE WAS SO HIGHLY DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS AND THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM THAT HE FELT VERY SORRY THAT HE HADN'T STARTED TEN YEARS SOONER
EVERY BONDMAN WHO WAS OLD ENOUGH TO REALIZE THE NATURE AND IMPORT OF THE CHANGE FELT A GREAT ANXIETY TO LEARN WHAT THE WILL OF THEIR OLD MISTRESS SAID WHETHER SHE HAD ACTUALLY FREED THEM OR NOT
BOIZE HENRY 481

SHE STATED THAT HER EXPERIENCE AS A SUFFERER IN CRUEL HANDS HAD BEEN VERY TRYING AND THAT IN FRETTING UNDER HARDSHIPS SHE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO BE FREE HER LANGUAGE WAS UNMISTAKABLE ON THIS POINT
BAGNAL A CLEVER YOUNG MAN WHO SINCERELY SYMPATHIZED WITH THE SLAVE HAVING A WIFE IN SLAVERY HIMSELF
THE SYMPATHY OF ANTI-SLAVERY LADIES WAS EXCITED AND MANY WERE PRESENT IN THE COURT-ROOM TO MANIFEST THEIR FEELINGS IN BEHALF OF THE STRICKEN WOMAN

IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN US TO HAVE CHALLENGED IN WORDS AN ANTI-SLAVERY DISCUSSION IN THE WORLD'S CONVENTION
JOHN WAS A MARRIED MAN AND SPOKE AFFECTIONATELY OF HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WHOM HE HAD TO LEAVE BEHIND AT CROSS-ROADS
FROM THIS FATE SHE WAS SAVED ONLY BY HER FIRM RESOLUTION TO SEEK HER FREEDOM

THERE WE WERE INFORMED BY A FRIENDLY COLORED MAN OF THE DANGER WE WERE IN AND OF THE BAD CHARACTER OF THE PLACE TOWARDS COLORED PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ESCAPING TO FREEDOM
WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR FATE SINCE IS NOT KNOWN
BOTH FUGITIVES AND PURSUERS WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF SEVERE WOUNDS FROM GUN SHOTS AND OTHER WEAPONS USED IN THE CONTEST

NEARLY ALL OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SUSPICION OR POSITIVE AVERSION AND HIS HOUSE WAS CONSTANTLY UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE POLICE WHO THEN SAD TO SAY WERE ALWAYS ON THE WATCH FOR ANY FUGITIVES FROM BONDAGE
BOTH TIMES THAT I WAS BEAT THE BLOOD RUN DOWN FROM MY HEAD TO MY FEET
ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN LIVING A SEA-FARING LIFE FOR MANY YEARS AND THE MARKS OF THIS CALLING WERE PLAINLY ENOUGH VISIBLE IN HIS MANNERS AND SPEECH HE WAS NEVERTHELESS UNLIKE THE GREAT MASS OF THIS CLASS OF MEN NOT ADDICTED TO INTEMPERANCE AND PROFANITY

YEARS BEFORE HER ESCAPE HER MISTRESS DIED IN ENGLAND
BUT I MUST SAY WHILE WE LOOK UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE POWER GREATNESS AND HONOR OF OLD ENGLAND AND BELIEVE THAT WHILE WE SIT BENEATH THE SILKEN FOLDS OF HER FLAG OF PERFECT LIBERTY WE ARE SECURE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE AGGRESSIONS OF THE BLOOD HOUNDS AND FREE FROM THE DESPOTISM THAT WOULD WRAP AROUND OUR LIMBS BY THE DAMABLE SLAVEHOLDER
I NEVER WROTE TO BALTIMORE NOR DID ANY PERSON WRITE FOR ME THERE AND IT IS WITH INDESCRIBABLE GRIEF THAT I HEAR WHAT YOUR LETTER COMMUNICATES TO ME OF THOSE WHO YOU SAY HAVE GOTTEN INTO DIFFICULTY ON MY ACCOUNT
THE ONLY NOTICE WHICH CAN BE FOUND AMONG HIS PAPERS OF THE VARIOUS SLAVE CASES IN WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED IS CONTAINED IN A MEMORANDUM BOOK WHICH HE COMMENCED IN THE SUMMER OF 1835
AND--AS YET TOO YOUNG AND IMMATURE FOR THAT CHARITY TO HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THEM WHICH CAN SEE A BROTHER EVEN IN THE EVIL-DOER AND PITY WHILE CONDEMNING HIM,--THEY EVEN MORE INTENSELY HATED WHILE THEY FEARED THE ACTORS IN THE OUTRAGE AND DESPISED THE GIRL WHO HAD BETRAYED THE VICTIM
PETER'S ATTENTION BEING DIRECTED TO THE OX HE TURNED HIM OUT AND GAVE HIM WHAT HE CONSIDERED PROPER CHASTISEMENT ACCORDING TO THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE
THEIR MILLS WOULD ALONE CONSUME THE COTTON GROWN ON THREE SUCH ESTATES AS THAT WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO CULTIVATE
IT WAS THURSDAY THE 13TH THAT I LIFT RICHMOND IT WAS SATURDAY THE 15TH THAT I LAND TO MY GREAT JOY IN THE CITY OF PHILA
HIS BOLD ASSERTION WAS GREETED WITH MINGLED CHEERS AND HISSES AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS SPEECH ONE OF THE JURORS WHO HAD CONVICTED HIM STRODE ACROSS THE BENCHES GRASPED HIS HAND AND BEGGED HIS FORGIVENNESS
HE WAS ABOUT FORTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO HIS RECKONING FULL SIX FEET HIGH AND IN MUSCULAR APPEARANCE WAS VERY RUGGED AND IN HIS COUNTENANCE WERE EVIDENT MARKS OF FIRMNESS
STILL:--DEAR SIR--I WRITE AT THIS TIME IN BEHALF OF OTHO TAYLOR
BEFORE REACHING THE LOCK THE CAPTAIN SUPPOSING THAT THEY MIGHT BE IN DANGER FROM CONTACT WITH BOATS MEN ETC AGAIN CALLED UPON THEM TO GO INTO THEIR HOLE UNDER THE DECK
IN TIME THE WAR CAME AND AS HE REMARKED THE NATION WENT INTO THE BUSINESS BY THE WHOLESALE SO HE QUIT HIS RETAIL OPERATIONS HAVING AFTER HE COMMENCED TO KEEP A RECORD HELPED OFF OVER TWENTY-ONE HUNDRED SLAVES AND NO INCONSIDERABLE NUMBER BEFORE THAT TIME
I AM TO OBEY ORDERS AND LEAVE THE REST TO THE GREAT CAPTAIN WHOSE WISDOM IS ABLE TO DIRECT
HILL A FUGITIVE
THIS WAS A CASE THAT APPEALED FOR SYMPATHY AND AID WHICH WERE CHEERFULLY RENDERED BY THE COMMITTEE
NOT A SINGLE SPOT HAD BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE EXCORIATING COW-HIDE
NO MORE AT PRESENT BUT REMAIN YOURS VERY TRULY PLEASE WRITE SOON
L3 FOR WILLIAM STILL FOR FUGITIVES
BEING UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THEIR ADVISER AND PROTECTOR HE WAS CONSTANTLY SOLICITED FOR HIS ADVICE ON QUESTIONS TOUCHING THEIR WELFARE
IT SHOWS THAT THE SCHOOL-MASTER OWES KNIGHT MORE SERVICE AND LABOR THAN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR CRAFT TO
VIRGINIA EVEN IMPRISONED WHITE WOMEN FOR TEACHING FREE COLORED CHILDREN THE ALPHABET
IN RICHMOND NORFOLK PETERSBURG AND OTHER PLACES WHERE HE TRADED MANY SLAVES WERE FULLY AWAKE TO THEIR CONDITION
IN THE CHANGE OF MASTERS HE WAS POSITIVE IN SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND A GOOD ONE AND BESIDES HE ENTERTAINED THE BELIEF THAT SUCH PERSONAGES WERE VERY RARE
HE HAD TOOK OUT VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING
HE TOOK WITH HIM A BAG MADE OF BRUSSELS CARPET WITH MY NAME WRITTEN IN LARGE ROUGH LETTERS ON THE BOTTOM AND A GOOD STOCK OF COARSE AND FINE CLOTHES AMONG THEM A NAVY CAP AND A LOW-CROWNED HAT
YOUNG MURRAY 473
WELL THERE ARE A GOOD MANY FROM MY OWN CITY WHO I KNOW--SOME I TALK TO ON PRIVATE MATTERS AND SOME I WONT
THE USAGE WHICH JACOB HAD ORDINARILY RECEIVED MADE HIM ANYTHING BUT CONTENTED
HOWEVER THIS WAS NO NEW THING
I FELT AS IF ALL WAS NOT RIGHT
SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE ANTI-SLAVERY ANTI-RUM AND ANTI-CATHOLIC
WITH DETERMINED WORDS THE FUGITIVES DECLARED THAT THE BOAT WAS THEIR OWN PROPERTY AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP
TWO OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN MANAGED TO REACH THE BOAT UPON THE RIVER BUT HAD TO RETURN TO HIS HORRIBLE PLACE UNDER THE FLOOR
DARK COPPER COLOR AND RATHER GOOD LOOKING
THEN YOU MAY LIVE ON THE FEW YEARS THAT ARE LEFT YOU AND PERHAPS--IT IS NOT CERTAIN--WE MAY BE PERMITTED TO MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND DIE IN OUR BEDS
THE COMMITTEE AFFORDED HIM NEEDED ASSISTANCE AND SENT HIM OFF
HE WAS FOR MANY YEARS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF ITS BOARD OF EDUCATION AND TOOK A PROMINENT PART IN EXTENDING THE BENEFITS OF LEARNING TO COLORED CHILDREN AND YOUTH
GEORGE HILL ALSO A FELLOW-PASSENGER WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK MEDIUM SIZE AND OF FAIR NATURAL MOTHER WIT
JOHN'S REASONS FOR LEAVING WERE NOT NOTED ON THE BOOK BUT HIS EAGERNESS TO REACH CANADA SPOKE LOUDER THAN WORDS SIGNIFYING THAT THE GREATER THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED HIM FROM THE OLD WHITE HALL FARM THE BETTER
THE RICHMOND DISPATCH AN ENTERPRISING PAPER IN THE INTEREST OF SLAVEHOLDERS WHICH CAME DAILY TO THE COMMITTEE WAS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE PASSENGERS WHEN LO
ONE WAS TO TAKE HER TRUNK AND ALL HER CLOTHING AND QUIETLY RETIRE THE OTHER WAS TO SUE OUT A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
THEY CUT HIM OFF FROM EVERY FRIENDLY REGARD WHICH WOULD ELSE HAVE BEEN DEVOTEDLY HIS ON THAT LEVEL OF EDUCATED LIFE AND LIMITED HIM TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WITHIN HIMSELF
A REWARD OF $400
AT THE TIME MR GARRETT'S LETTER WAS HANDED TO ME NARRATING THE FOREGOING CASE OF MAN STEALING I WAS LISTENING TO THE SAD TALES OF TWO COLORED WOMEN WHO HAD COME TO THE OFFICE FOR ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
IS THERE ANOTHER SLAVE CASE AND MY LITTLE GIRLS LOOK UP ANXIOUSLY FOR MY REPLY
IN THE LIGHT THAT CAME TO HIM FROM HEAVEN ALL STOOD ALIKE CHILDREN OF THE GREAT FATHER
GIVE GOD THE PRAISE WHO LED THEE THROUGH A CRIMSON SEA AND MID THE STORM OF FIRE AND BLOOD TURNED OUT THE WAR-CLOUD'S LIGHT TO THEE
THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION WAS SOMETIMES TOUCHING IN THE EXTREME
WHILE BOTH THESE PASSENGERS MANIFESTED GREAT SATISFACTION IN LEAVING THEIR MISTRESS THEY DID NOT GIVE HER A BAD NAME
OSWEGO OCT 25TH 1857
MY SISTER ABOUT THE FIRST OF THIS MONTH THREE WEEKS AFTER HER CONFINEMENT HAD WORD SENT TO HER BY HER MISTRESS MRS TUNIS THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS TIME FOR HER TO COME OUT AND GO TO WORK AS SHE HAD BEEN LAYING BY LONG ENOUGH IN REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE WILLIAM SAID THAT HIS SISTER SENT WORD TO HER MISTRESS THAT SHE WAS NOT WELL ENOUGH AND BEGGED THAT HER MISTRESS WOULD PLEASE SEND HER SOME TEA AND SUGAR UNTIL SHE GOT WELL ENOUGH TO GO TO WORK
THE FIRST EFFORT TO COME AWAY WAS MADE ON THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND
ITS TRUE THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED AS YET BUT I LIVES HOPES TO BE AT WORK VERY SHORTLY
WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THESE CAPTAINS LEFT NORFOLK ABOUT THE TWENTIETH OF JANUARY BUT DID NOT REACH PHILADELPHIA TILL ABOUT THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH HAVING BEEN FROZEN UP OF COURSE DURING THE GREATER PART OF THAT TIME
BEING A FELLOW-SERVANT WITH EDWARD HENRY WAS A PARTY TO THE PLAN OF ESCAPE
UP TO FEBRUARY LAST DID THIS VENERABLE SAINT CONTINUE HIS ABUNDANT LABORS
THERE HAS BEEN QUITE AN AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE AND TROUBLE IN THE STATE
OF THEIR MISTRESS JOHN SAID THAT SHE WAS A PRETTY EASY KIND OF A WOMAN ONLY SHE DIDN'T WANT TO ALLOW ENOUGH TO EAT AND WOULDN'T MEND ANY CLOTHES FOR US ISAAC WAS TWENTY-TWO QUITE BLACK AND BELONGED TO THE RISING YOUNG SLAVES OF DELAWARE
THEY ALL REMEMBER YOU AS THEIR FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR AND RETURN TO YOU THEIR SINCERE THANKS
POOR THING WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE FOR HER
NOBODY PULLED ME AND NOBODY LED ME
I HOPE YOU WILL AS MRS MERCER HAVE TOLD THE FRIEND WHAT TO DO I CANNOT DO MORE THEREFORE I MUST LEVE IT TO THE MERCY OF GOD AND YOUR EXERTION
BUT IT IS NO MARVEL THAT TO HER THE MEMORY OF THAT POOR RUNAWAY SLAVE-WOMAN'S TRUE AFFECTION IS MORE THAN COULD HAVE BEEN THE WARMEST WELCOME FROM HER EDUCATED AND REFINED MISTRESS
AND THE SAID COURT SHALL ALLOW A REASONABLE COMPENSATION TO BE PAID TO THE MEMBERS OF SUCH PATROL
THIS WAS NOT HARD WORK
THEN TO LISTEN FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO THEIR INTELLIGENT NARRATION OF HOW THEY ESCAPED THE MOTIVES THAT PROMPTED THEM ETC
HE SAID HE HAD NO MONEY AND WOULD RATHER DIE WITH HIS FAMILY THAN BE KILLED ON THE ROAD
IN 1834 I THINK WAS THE FIRST RIOTING THE SACKING OF MR TAPPAN'S HOUSE IN ROSE STREET
WASHINGTON GEO 143
THE COLORED MEN SAID THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COATS AT THE HOUSE
PERHAPS IT WAS THOUGHTLESSNESS ON THE PART OF SOME AND A WISH TO INSPIRE DUE CAUTIOUSNESS ON THE PART OF OTHERS THAT PROMPTED THIS ADVICE
NOT ALLOWED TO SEEK A MASTER;"--"VERY DEVILISH;"--FATHER LEAVES TWO LITTLE SONS;"--"USED HARD;"--"FEARED FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG HEIRS ETC
WE ARE TOLD TO MARK THE PERFECT MAN AND BEHOLD THE UPRIGHT FOR THE END OF THAT MAN IS PEACE
THE MORE SHE KEPT THE IDEA OF PERPETUAL SLAVERY BEFORE THE SLAVES THE MORE JACK RESOLVED TO MAKE HER ARROGANCE COST HER ONE SLAVE AT LEAST
I GOT TO ALBANY NEXT MORNING IN TIME TO TAKE THE HALF PAST SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR ROCHESTER HERE I STAY UNTEL WENSDAY NIGHT
BUT ON THIS POINT HE SEEMED TO GIVE HIMSELF NO MORE CONCERN THAN HE WOULD HAVE DONE TO KNOW WHICH WAY THE WIND WOULD BLOW THE NEXT DAY
BEALE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A MAN OF WEALTH AND HAD INVESTED IN SLAVE STOCK TO THE NUMBER OF SEVENTY HEAD
WHILE THIS AMOUNT SEEMED LIGHT IT WAS MUCH HEAVIER THAN JIM FELT WILLING TO MEET SOLELY FOR HIS MASTER'S BENEFIT
MY BEST LOVE TO ALL
FOR STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM OUR FRIEND HAD UNDER HIS PLAIN GARB--UNCHANGED IN FORM SINCE THE DAYS OF FRANKLIN TO GO NO FURTHER BACK--A FINE DRAMATIC TALENT AND COULD NOT RELATE THE HUMBLEST INCIDENT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PICTURESQUE OR DRAMATIC TURN SPEAKING NOW FOR ONE CHARACTER NOW FOR ANOTHER WITH A VARIETY AND DISCRIMINATION VERY REMARKABLE
NOR WAS HE BY ANY MEANS CERTAIN THAT AN EFFORT IN THIS DIRECTION WOULD PROVE SUCCESSFUL
25TH 1859
I LONG TO SEE IT
BUT HIS ABOUNDING SYMPATHY WAS ESPECIALLY DRAWN OUT TOWARDS THE POOR IMBRUTED SLAVES OF THE PLANTATION AND SUCH OF THEIR NUMBER AS SOUGHT THEIR FREEDOM BY FLIGHT
MR LEMMON SENDS HIS RESPECTS TO YOU AND MRS STILL
RATHER WITH THE GLOSS AND HARD POLISH WHICH READING AND WEALTH AND THE FINER APPOINTMENTS OF LIVING CAN THROW OVER SPIRITUAL ARREST OR DECAY
SO WHEN JAMES MIND WAS FULLY MADE UP TO ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY HE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE BEST TO BREAK THE SECRET TO HIS POOR WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT TO GET OFF TO CANADA AND AFTERWARDS TO TRY AND SEE WHAT HE COULD DO FOR THEIR DELIVERANCE
FOR THEY REST FROM THEIR LABORS AND THEIR WORKS DO FOLLOW THEM DO AT ONCE SEE HIS CHILDREN AND CLARKSON TAYLOR AND GIVE THEM MY CONDOLENCE NO MY CONGRATULATION AND ASSURE THEM THAT THEY HAVE A RICH LEGACY IN HIS NOBLE LIFE AND HE HAS A GLORIOUS REWARD IN THE BOSOM OF GOD

WILMINGTON 12TH MO 1ST 1860
HARRIET TUBMAN HAD BEEN THEIR MOSES BUT NOT IN THE SENSE THAT ANDREW JOHNSON WAS THE MOSES OF THE COLORED PEOPLE SHE HAD FAITHFULLY GONE DOWN INTO EGYPT AND HAD DELIVERED THESE SIX BONDMEN BY HER OWN HEROISM
I AM QUITE UNWELL BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T CARE
HE NEVER WAS KNOWN IT MAY SAFELY BE SAID TO HESITATE IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF SLAVERY TO GIVE HIS TIME AND TALENTS TO THE FUGITIVE EVEN IN THE MOST HOPELESS CASES AND WHEN FROM THE UNPOPULARITY OF SUCH A COURSE SERIOUS SACRIFICES WOULD BE LIKELY TO RESULT
AND FURTHER TO FULFILL PERFECT AND BRING TO EFFECT THE SAID TRAITOROUS INTENTION OF HIM THE SAID JAMES JACKSON AND IN PURSUANCE AND EXECUTION OF THE SAID WICKED AND TRAITOROUS COMBINATION TO OPPOSE AND RESIST THE SAID LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM BEING CARRIED INTO EXECUTION IN THE STATE AND DISTRICT AFORESAID HE THE SAID JAMES JACKSON TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER PERSONS WHOSE NAMES ARE TO THIS INQUEST AS YET UNKNOWN ON THE DAY AND YEAR FIRST AFORESAID AND ON DIVERS OTHER DAYS AND TIMES AS WELL BEFORE AND AFTER AT THE DISTRICT AFORESAID WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT WITH FORCE AND ARMS MALICIOUSLY AND TRAITOROUSLY DID PREPARE AND COMPOSE AND DID THEN AND THERE MALICIOUSLY AND TRAITOROUSLY CAUSE AND PROCURE TO BE PREPARED AND COMPOSED DIVERS BOOKS PAMPHLETS LETTERS DECLARATIONS RESOLUTIONS ADDRESSES PAPERS AND WRITINGS AND DID THEN AND THERE MALICIOUSLY AND TRAITOROUSLY PUBLISH AND DISPERSE AND CAUSE TO BE PUBLISHED AND DISPERSED DIVERS OTHER BOOKS AND

ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WERE LOST IN THE DEPARTURE OF NANCY
GEORGE CARROLL IS IN HAMILTON
HENRY 416
THESE WERE NOT ALL BUT SUFFICED FOR A BEGINNING
THEY REFUSED OF COURSE AS WOULD ANY MAN NOT UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF HONOR HUMANITY AND MORAL PRINCIPLE AND WARNED THE ASSAILANTS THAT IT WAS MADNESS FOR THEM TO ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE FUGITIVE SLAVES THERE OR EVEN TO REMAIN AND BEGGED THEM IF THEY WISHED TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES TO LEAVE THE GROUND
WHILE MANY SYMPATHIZED WITH THE SLAVE IN HIS CHAINS AND FREELY WEPT OVER HIS DESTINY OR GAVE MONEY TO HELP BUY HIS FREEDOM BUT FEW COULD BE FOUND WHO WERE WILLING TO TAKE THE RISK OF GOING INTO THE SOUTH AND STANDING FACE TO FACE WITH SLAVERY IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A PANTING SLAVE TO FREEDOM
IN HIS VISITS FOR THIS PURPOSE OF COURSE HE FORMED ACQUAINTANCES WITH ALL SORTS OF SEA-FARING CHARACTERS
ONCE TO THE TRADER REED AND AFTERWARDS TO JOHN FREELAND AND AGAIN WAS ON THE EVE OF BEING SOLD
A PRIVATE BERTH WAS PROCURED FOR HIM ON THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND FOR THE AMOUNT OF $125 AND THUS HE WAS BROUGHT ON SAFELY TO PHILADELPHIA
HE WAS OF UNMIXED BLOOD MEDIUM SIZE AND OF HUMBLE APPEARANCE
HE REACHED THE COMMITTEE SAFELY IN THIS CITY IN ADVANCE OF HIS COMPANION AND WAS FURNISHED WITH A FREE TICKET AND OTHER NEEDED ASSISTANCE AND WAS SENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING

YOU MAY IMAGINE THE HAPPINESS MANIFESTED ON THE PART OF THE TWO LOVERS MR H
BY ONE OF HIS OWNERS NAMED BURKE JOHN ALLEGED THAT HE HAD BEEN CRUELLY USED WHEN QUITE YOUNG BOTH HE AND HIS SISTER TOGETHER WITH THEIR MOTHER WERE SOLD BY BURKE
THE COURAGE WHICH HAD SO OFTEN BEEN SHOWN IN THE FACE OF GREAT DANGER SATISFIED THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE WERE HEROES AND HEROINES AMONG THESE PASSENGERS FULLY ENTITLED TO THE APPLAUSE OF THE LIBERTY-LOVING CITIZENS OF BROTHERLY LOVE
INDEED HE COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN HIMSELF
HE WAS BELOVED ALMOST TO ADORATION BY HIS DUSKY-HUED FRIENDS AND IN THE DARK DAYS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR WHICH EVERY WILMINGTONIAN WILL REMEMBER WITH A SHUDDER IN THOSE DAYS OF DOUBT CONFUSION AND SUSPICION WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT THOMAS GARRETT'S HOUSE WAS CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED AND WATCHED BY FAITHFUL BLACK MEN RESOLVED THAT COME WEAL COME WOE TO THEM NO HARM SHOULD COME TO THE BENEFACTOR OF THEIR RACE

ANXIOUS INQUIRIES WERE MADE AS TO THE PERSON WHO HAD THE AUDACITY TO QUESTION THE RIGHT OF THIS QUIET PEACEABLE MAN TO DO WITH HIS SLAVE AS HE PLEASED
PARKER WM 350
ONE MORNING HE UNEXPECTEDLY TO WILLIAM GAVE HIM A TERRIBLE COWHIDING WHICH CONTRARY TO THE MASTER'S DESIGNS MADE HIM A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE DOCTRINE OF IMMEDIATE ABOLITION AND HE THOUGHT THAT FROM THAT HOUR HE MUST DO SOMETHING AGAINST THE SYSTEM--IF NOTHING MORE THAN TO GO TO CANADA
TAYLOR EDWARD WITH A BROTHER AND HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN 320
I HAVE BEEN TWO WEEKS ON THE DECKS OF STEAMBOATS THREE NIGHTS OUT TWO OF WHICH I GOT PERFECTLY WET

HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD DEFEATED THE DOCTOR AND SO WAS THE COMMITTEE
HE SPOKE FREELY OF THE MAN WHO CLAIMED HIM AS A SLAVE SAYING THAT HIS NAME WAS SHEPHERD HOUSTON OF LEWISTOWN DELAWARE AND THAT HE OWNED SEVEN HEAD OF GOD'S POOR WHOM HE COMPELLED TO LABOR ON HIS FARM WITHOUT A CENT OF PAY A DAY'S SCHOOLING OR AN HOUR'S FREEDOM
HE SPOKE RATHER KINDLY OF HER AND FELT THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN USED VERY HARD AS A GENERAL THING ALTHOUGH HE WISELY ADDED THE BEST USAGE WAS BAD ENOUGH SHERIDAN HAD NEARLY REACHED HIS TWENTY-EIGHTH YEAR WAS TALL AND WELL MADE AND POSSESSED OF A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF INTELLIGENCE

THIS WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE OF DEATH ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN THIS REGION
THE WELFARE AND HAPPINESS OF TOO MANY HUMAN BEINGS WERE AT STAKE TO PERMIT HIM TO THINK OF PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES AND HE WAS READY AND DARED TO ENCOUNTER ANY RISK FOR HIMSELF SO THAT HE COULD INSURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE FLEEING FROM BONDAGE

HOWEVER JUDGING FROM WHAT WAS SEEN OF ISAAC IN PHILADELPHIA THERE WAS MORE CUNNING THAN FOOLISHNESS ABOUT HIM
BOTH THE KIDNAPPING AND THE MURDER AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE SHOCKED AND EXCITED THE BETTER THINKING AND HUMANE CLASSES LARGELY NOT ONLY IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OVER THE NORTHERN STATES
YOU MUST LISTEN TO THE IMPASSIONED APPEAL OF THE WIFE WHOSE HUSBAND'S RETREAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND WHOSE FOOTSTEPS ARE DOGGED BY THE BLOOD-HOUNDS OF SLAVERY

THIS IS NOT YOUR BOAT WE BOUGHT THIS BOAT AND PAID FOR IT SPAKE ONE OF THE BRAVE FUGITIVES
THE LAST BELL TOLLED
HE WOULD HAVE HER BEATEN UNMERCIFULLY WITHOUT CAUSE AND THEN HAVE HER STRIPES WASHED IN SALT WATER THEN HE WOULD HAVE HER DRAGGED THROUGH THE HORSE POND UNTIL SHE WAS NEARLY DEAD
ALSO TWO OF MR DADE'S LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WENT THE SAME TIME
WHEN WE APPROACHED I GAVE MY SIGNAL FIRST
IF HE GETS ANY MORE THAN THAT HE HAS GOT TO FIND IT HIMSELF HOW ABOUT SUNDAY CLOTHING FIND THEM YOURSELF HOW ABOUT A HOUSE TO LIVE IN HAVE THAT TO FIND YOURSELF SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A WIFE AND FAMILY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THEY DON'T ALLOW YOU ANYTHING FOR THAT AT ALL SUPPOSE YOU ARE SICK WHO PAYS YOUR DOCTOR'S BILL HE MASTER PAYS THAT HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY BY GETTING UP BEFORE DAY AND CARRYING OUT PAPERS AND DOING OTHER JOBS CLEANING UP SINGLE MEN'S ROOMS AND THE LIKE OF THAT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN EMPLOYED AT IN RICHMOND BEEN WORKING IN TOBACCO FACTORY IN GENERAL
WHILE HERE HE WAS ENTIRELY RELIEVED OF THE AFFLICTION CAUSED BY THE FALL AND WAS RESTORED TO SOUND HEALTH
THE MEETING AND INTERVIEW WAS DOUBTLESS VERY JOYOUS
I GET THEM FOR FIFTY CENTS A PAIR
LAST NIGHT AFTER I HAD WRITTEN THE ABOVE AND HAD GONE TO BED I HEARD A STRANGE VOICE IN THE HOUSE SAYING TO MR MYERS TO COME QUICKLY TO ONE OF OUR COLOD BROTHERAN OUT OF THE STREET
SHE IS FROM WASHINGTON CITY
JAMES LEFT THREE SISTERS AND ONE BROTHER CHARLOTTE SUSAN ELLEN AND JOHNSON ALL SLAVES
ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE HE ESCAPED HIS MASTER THREATENED TO SELL HIM SOUTH
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
SOME THREE WEEKS AGO A BIG BOX WAS CONSIGNED TO US BY J
THE DR HAS BEEN HERE HE WAS THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND LEFT THIS YOUNG LAD AND SAID THAT HE WOULD CALL AGAIN AND SEE ABOUT HIM SAID MRS S
HARPER JOHN NEEDLES CONTENTS
SHE CONTRIBUTED APPARENTLY WITH THE SAME LIBERALITY AS THOUGH THEY WERE HER OWN NEAR KIN
NO SPECIAL COMPLAINT OF HER IS RECORDED ON THE BOOK
SAID LEWIS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO HE SHOT A FREE MAN AND THE MAN DIED ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS
OH THE MISERY THE SORROW WHICH THIS CURSED SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IS CONSTANTLY BRINGING UPON MILLIONS IN THIS LAND OF BOASTED FREEDOM
HE WAS CALLED UPON IN THIS TRYING HOUR TO LEAVE HIS WIFE WITH THREE CHILDREN BUT THEY WERE FORTUNATELY FREE
TIMES HAS BEEN HARD THIS WINTER BUT THEY ARE INCREASING FOR THE BETTER
HE OF COURSE SAW FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES TO BE ENCOUNTERED ALL THE WAY ALONG IN ESCAPING BUT THESE HE CONSIDERED WOULD BE MORE EASY FOR HIM TO OVERCOME THAN IT WOULD BE FOR HIM TO LEARN THE LESSON--"SERVANTS OBEY YOUR MASTERS THE VERY IDEA MADE JAMES SICK
SHE SAID A MAN HAD OFFERED FOR THAT SUM TO BRING THEM ON
AND TO FULFILL AND BRING TO EFFECT THE SAID TRAITOROUS INTENTION OF HIM THE SAID JAMES JACKSON HE THE SAID JAMES JACKSON AFTERWARD TO WIT ON THE DAY AND YEAR AFORESAID IN THE STATE DISTRICT AND COUNTY AFORESAID AND WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COURT WITH A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PERSONS WHOSE NAMES TO THIS INQUEST ARE AS YET UNKNOWN TO A GREAT NUMBER TO WIT TO THE NUMBER OF ONE HUNDRED PERSONS AND UPWARDS ARMED AND ARRAYED IN A WARLIKE MANNER THAT IS TO SAY WITH GUNS SWORDS AND OTHER WARLIKE WEAPONS AS WELL OFFENSIVE AS DEFENSIVE BEING THEN AND THERE UNLAWFULLY AND TRAITOROUSLY ASSEMBLED DID TRAITOROUSLY ASSEMBLE AND COMBINE AGAINST THE SAID UNITED STATES AND THEN AND THERE WITH FORCE AND ARMS WICKEDLY AND TRAITOROUSLY AND WITH THE WICKED AND TRAITOROUS INTENTION TO OPPOSE AND PREVENT BY MEANS OF INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE THE EXECUTION OF THE SAID LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE SAME DID ARRAY AND DISPOSE THEMSELVES IN A WARLIKE AND HOSTILE MANNER
IT IMPOSES INDEED NO NEW OBLIGATION
GREAT BRITAIN IS JUST NOW GETTING REALLY WARM ON THE ANTI-SLAVERY SUBJECT AND IS LONGING TO SHAKE HERSELF FROM BEING SO DEPENDENT AS HITHERTO ON SLAVE PRODUCE
HE WAS SHIVERING WITH COLD AND FRIGHT
SHE WAS CALCULATED TO RENDER SLAVE LIFE VERY UNHAPPY
SUCH AN OCCASION WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR AND WAS PREVENTED BY THE ADMIRABLE COOLNESS AND FORETHOUGHT OF THOMAS SHIPLEY
NOT COMPREHENDING THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW HE FANCIED THAT HE WOULD BE SAFE SO LONG AS HE KEPT MATTERS PRIVATE CONCERNING HIS ORIGIN
DOUBTLESS IF THESE MOTHERS WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND PARTNERS IN TRIBULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS THEY ARRIVED DIRECT FROM THE BOATS MANY HEARTS WOULD HAVE MELTED AND MANY TEARS WOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY DOWN MANY CHEEKS
I UNDERSTOOD THAT LOUISA TRUIT WAS GLOUCESTER'S WIFE UNDER THIS SEARCHING CROSS-EXAMINATION MR BROWN CONSTRAINED HIM NOT ONLY TO TELL ALL AND MORE THAN HE KNEW IN FAVOR OF HIS FRIEND THE CLAIMANT BUT WRUNG FROM HIM THE SECRETS WHICH HE STOOD PLEDGED NEVER TO DISCLOSE
HE TOLD THEM THAT THERE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH INFORMATION UPON THAT MEASURE DIFFUSED IN ENGLAND FOR LYING TO CONCEAL THEM
DEAR SIR I DO PRAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THAT THE HIGH HEAVENS MAY BLESS YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS
BUT IF YOU CANNOT WRITE TO ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL ME ALL THAT YOU CAN BUT DON'T BE DESSCUREDGED I WAS SORY TO LEAVE YOU AND I COULD NOT HELP IT FOR YOU KNOW THAT I PROMEST SEE YOU TO SISTER BUT I WAS PERSUADED BY ANOTHER MAN GO PART WITH IT GRIVED MUTCH YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT I DID NOT CARE FOR YOU
I SPOKE IN COLUMBUS ON THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION
AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE DAYS WITH HER NEW FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA SHE WAS SENT ON IN MALE ATTIRE TO LEWIS TAPPAN OF NEW YORK WHO HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HER CASE FROM THE BEGINNING AND WHO HELD HIMSELF READY AS WAS UNDERSTOOD TO CASH A DRAFT FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO COMPENSATE THE MAN WHO MIGHT RISK HIS OWN LIBERTY IN BRINGING HER ON FROM WASHINGTON
HE ACCEPTED THE FAVORS OF FRIENDS WHO OFFERED HIM ASSISTANCE WITH A VIEW OF PREPARING HIM FOR A MISSION AMONG THE FREEDMEN BELIEVING THAT HE POSSESSED IN A HIGH DEGREE THE ELEMENTS FOR A USEFUL WORKER PREACHER ORGANIZER AND TEACHER
BUT IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH EACH ARRIVAL TRAVELED SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED
SHE WAS NONE THE LESS ANXIOUS HOWEVER TO SECURE HER FREEDOM
STILL AS IGNORANT AS PART OF THE PEOPLE ARE PERHAPS A NUMBER OF THEM WOULD NOT HEAR AT ALL AND MAY BE PREJUDICE OTHERS IF I CHARGED EVEN TEN CENTS AND SO PERHAPS IN THE LONG RUN EVEN IF MY WORK IS WEARING I MAY BE OF SOME REAL BENEFIT TO MY RACE
THE NAME OF THE SHERIFF THAT HE OUTGENERALLED WAS WALTER COX
TEN MONTHS PASSED AWAY DURING WHICH TIME HE SUFFERED ALMOST DEATH BUT PERSUADED HIMSELF TO BELIEVE THAT EVEN THAT WAS BETTER THAN SLAVERY
WHITE WM
NOW IS A MOMENT OF INTENSE INTEREST--NOW OF INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT
I FOUND MY SISTER VERY WELL
ADAM GIBSON A FREE COLORED MAN RESIDING IN PHILADELPHIA WAS ARRESTED DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ALLEGED CLAIMANTS BY COMMISSIONER EDWARD D

WALKINSHAW
YOUNG ANNA ELIZABETH WITH BABE IN ARMS 507
I NEVER HEARD HIM TELL HIS NAME
SHE HAD BEEN A WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT HER OWN FATHER'S BRAINS HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT BY THE DISCHARGE OF A HEAVILY LOADED GUN DELIBERATELY AIMED AT HIS HEAD BY HIS DRUNKEN MASTER
HIS RISK WAS VERY GREAT
I WAS TREATED MONSTROUS BAD
MR STILL KEPT A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE SUFFERINGS AND TRIALS OF HIS RACE DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE TO HIS POSTERITY RATHER THAN FROM ANY HOPE OF THE OVERTHROW OF THE REVOLTING SYSTEM OF HUMAN SERVITUDE HE RESOLVED TO SPREAD BEFORE THE WORLD THIS UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIENCE
WHAT ARE YOU LECTURING ABOUT THE QUESTION COMES UP AND IF I SAY AMONG OTHER TOPICS POLITICS THEN I MAY LOOK FOR AN ONSET
THE TIME ALLOTTED TO FILL THE DUTIES OF THIS OFFICE WAS HOWEVER BEFORE SUNRISE IN THE MORNING
THEY WERE FROM ALDIE P.O LONDON COUNTY VIRGINIA AND PASSED THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE 11TH OF JUNE
JACOB MATTHIAS BOYER LEFT AT ABOUT THE AGE OF TWENTY
HENRY BEING SPIRITED AND HUNGERING FOR FREEDOM WHILE HIS MASTER WAS OLD AND HARDENED IN HIS HABITS VERY GRAVE RESULTS HAD WELL NIGH HAPPENED
GIBSON ADAM 343
HE HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING HER AGAIN
MONTGOMERY GREEN KEEPS A BARBER SHOP IN CAYUGA IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EYE OF SLAVERY COULD DO NOTHING MORE THAN WATCH FOR AN OCCASION TO POUNCE UPON HIM
ARRIVING IN TORONTO AND NOT FINDING HER HOPES FULLY REALIZED WITH REGARD TO MEETING HER HUSBAND SHE WROTE BACK THE FOLLOWING LETTER
FOR A LONG TIME JOHN FAILED TO SEE THE REMEDY BUT AS HE GREW OLDER AND WISER THE SCALES FELL FROM HIS EYES AND HE PERCEIVED THAT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RAN NEAR HIS MASTER'S PLACE CAMBRIDGE MD AND BY A VERY LITTLE EFFORT AND A LARGE DEGREE OF COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE HE MIGHT MANAGE TO GET OUT OF MARYLAND AND ON TO CANADA WHERE SLAVE-HOLDERS HAD NO MORE RIGHTS THAN OTHER PEOPLE
DEC
WELL-DEVELOPED FOR THEIR AGE MODEST AND FINELY-FORMED MULATTOES

CATTO WAS CALLED TO THE CHAIR AND WM
AND SO I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED LAUGHTER ON GOING TO WASHINGTON I MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT LINCOLN THE DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD MET WITH
HAVE THEY BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA FROM WHAT I CAN LEARN THEY WILL LEAVE ALEX IN MOURNING NEXT SPRING IN THE LAST LETTER I GOT FROM MY BROTHER HE NAMED A GOOD MANY THAT WANTED TO COME WHEN HE DID AND THE ARE ALL SOUND MEN AND CAN BE TRUSTED
ABOUT THE AGE OF TWENTY-ONE HE ENTERED UPON THE PURSUITS OF THE BUSINESS HE HAD SELECTED
AN ENCLOSED SLIP CONTAINS THE MARKS OF ONE OF THE PACKAGES WHICH YOU WILL READ AND THEN IMMEDIATELY BURN
THE SERVANT WAS TO EXPLAIN
THE MOTIVE WHICH PROMPTED THEM TO ESCAPE WAS THE FACT THAT THEIR MASTER HAD THREATENED TO SELL THEM
SO ONE SATURDAY EVENING TOWARD THE LATTER PART OF JANUARY THE FOUR YOUNG SLAVES STOOD ON THE BEACH NEAR LEWES DELAWARE AND CAST THEIR LONGING EYES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE JERSEY SHORE
I WAS WELL CARED FOR

HE FLED FROM BEAUFORT NORTH CAROLINA
IRELAND PORT REPUBLIC MD
NEW YORK MAY 30
SHE WAS PROBABLY SIXTY OR SEVENTY
STILL HE WAS WHOLLY FREE FROM ACRIMONY AND EVEN IN RECOUNTING HIS SUFFERINGS WAS FILLED WITH CHARITY TOWARDS HIS OPPRESSORS
I WISH YOU WOULD COPY OFF THIS LETTER AND GIVE IT TO THE STEWARD AND TELL HIM TO GIVE IT TO HENRY LEWY AND TELL HIM TO GIVE IT TO MY WIFE
PART OF THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO ME BUT NOT DIRECTED TO ME
WE WOULD HAVE YOU LIKE MEN FIRMLY RESOLVED TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN RIGHTS
IT WILL PROVE DESIRABLE AS A CURIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE OF THE TIMES AND WILL BE BOUGHT IN EVERY HOME NORTH AND SOUTH EAST AND WEST WHERE READING IS CHERISHED
YET HE CONSIDERED HIS MASTER MORE IN FAULT THAN THE MAN TO WHOM HE WAS HIRED BUT REDRESS THERE WAS NONE SAVE TO ESCAPE
THIS CAMPBELL WAS A FARMER AND WAS SAID TO BE THE OWNER OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED HEAD OF SLAVES BESIDES HAVING LARGE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER DIRECTIONS
THE MASTERLY MANAGEMENT OF ABOLITIONISTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COUNSEL SAVED POOR EUPHEMIA FROM BEING DRAGGED FROM HER CHILDREN INTO HOPELESS BONDAGE
BUT ALL THESE WERE BUT THE EXPLOITS OF INDIVIDUALS
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LISTEN TO THE STORY OF THE FUGITIVE'S SUFFERINGS HIS MIND CHANGED
IN MARCH AS CONTEMPLATED CONCKLIN ARRIVED IN INDIANA AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED WITH PETER'S WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AND SENT A THRILLING LETTER TO THE WRITER PORTRAYING IN THE MOST VIVID LIGHT HIS ADVENTUROUS FLIGHT FROM THE HOUR THEY LEFT ALABAMA UNTIL THEIR ARRIVAL IN INDIANA

DEAR MR

DEAR MR
THE LAST FLOGGING I RECEIVED FROM HIM WAS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS BEFORE LAST CHRISTMAS
IT WAS THIS DOMESTIC TROUBLE IN ALFRED'S OPINION THAT RENDERED HIS SALE INDISPENSABLE
HER OLDEST CHILD WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEVEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED LYDIA
N.B
N.B
N.B
STOP BUT I KEPT ON RUNNING AND WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT THE MORE HE THOUGHT OVER THE BRUTAL CONDUCT OF HIS MASTER THE MORE DECIDED HE BECAME NEVER TO SERVE HIM MORE AND STRAIGHTWAY HE RESOLVED TO TRY TO REACH CANADA
HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT BY HIS MISTRESS WHO RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ANNUM
NOW MARK THE CONTRAST
HAD HE REMAINED IN NORFOLK HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST PROSPECT OF BEING REUNITED TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AS HE HAD BEEN ALREADY SEPARATED FROM THEM FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS
ALL THAT HE COULD SAY OF HIS OWNER WAS THAT HE WAS A HARD MASTER FROM WHOM HE WAS VERY GLAD TO ESCAPE
EDGAR SAYS HE WAS RAISED IN NORFOLK COUNTY HAS WORKED ABOUT NORFOLK SEVERAL YEARS
WILLIAM 104
THE FUNERAL OF THOMAS GARRETT WHICH TOOK PLACE ON SATURDAY PARTOOK ALMOST OF THE CHARACTER OF A POPULAR OVATION TO THE MEMORY OF THE DECEASED THOUGH IT WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PLAINNESS OF FORM WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE SOCIETY OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER
THE YOUNG MISTRESS SHOWED LITTLE OR NO SIGN OF THINKING OTHERWISE WHILE HE REMAINED BUT AFTER HE WAS GONE SHE RAVED AND WENT ON IN A GREAT WAY AND TOLD HER BROTHER IF HE THE MINISTER EVER MARRIED HER HE WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF HIS NOTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM IT WAS JOHN'S OPINION THAT THE SUBJECT OF MATRIMONY WAS THEN UNDER CONSIDERATION BETWEEN THEM
THE YOUNG MASTERS FOLLOWED PLAYING CARDS NO CHANCE AT ALL HAD BEEN ALLOWED THEM TO LEARN TO READ ALTHOUGH ABRAM AND LEEDS BOTH COVETED THIS KNOWLEDGE
I WAS BORN THE SLAVE OF A MR CONWAY OF WASHINGTON D.C UNDER THIS PERSONAGE GEORGE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED SLAVERY IN RATHER A MILD FORM UNTIL DEATH TOOK THE OLD MAN OFF WHICH EVENT OCCURRED WHEN GEORGE WAS QUITE YOUNG
A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD--BOB ESCAPES FROM HIS MASTER A TRADER WITH $1500 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY
JAMES FLED FROM CECIL CO MD
NOT RELISHING THE IDEA OF HAVING TO WORK ALL HIS LIFE IN BONDAGE DESTITUTE OF ALL PRIVILEGES HE RESOLVED TO SEEK A REFUGE IN CANADA
WITH ALL THE EFFORTS EXERTED BY SLAVE-HOLDERS THEY COULD NOT PREVENT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD FROM BRINGING AWAY PASSENGERS
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE
ZEBULON GREEN WAS THE NEXT TRAVELER
LEMUEL JOHN AND JOSIAH WERE BROTHERS
HIS COMPLAINTS WERE THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED BAD ALLOWED NO PRIVILEGES TO MAKE ANYTHING ALLOWED NO SUNDAY CLOTHING C
AND THROUGH SUCH KIND-HEARTED FRIENDS AS MR STEVENS THE PECULIAR HARDSHIPS OF THIS INTERESTING FAMILY OF WEEMS WERE BROUGHT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THOUSANDS OF PHILANTHROPISTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND ENGLAND AND LIBERAL CONTRIBUTIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE BY FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OCEAN
FOR THIS JEWEL THEY WERE WILLING TO MAKE ANY SACRIFICE OR TO ENDURE ANY AMOUNT OF SUFFERING
GROSS CHAS
SHERIFF GAW WROTE TO MR MAITLAND IN PHILADELPHIA TO WHOM HE REFERRED AND RECEIVED AN ANSWER THAT MR MAITLAND WAS DEAD AND NONE OF THE FAMILY KNEW HIM
AND BY DINT OF ALL THESE MATTERS THIS LONG CONTINUED ACQUAINTANCE ONLY REVIVING THE IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED IN EARLY LIFE THEY HAD NO DOUBT OF THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON
AS I WAS OFTEN THREATENED BY MY MASTER WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK I FELT I MUST GIVE UP ALL AND ESCAPE FOR MY LIFE SUCH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY THE STORY OF CORNELIUS HENRY JOHNSON
BUT THIS OUTRAGE HAS GAINED ME MANY FRIENDS AND WILL DO MUCH TOWARDS PUTTING DOWN SLAVERY IN THE STATE
THE FUGITIVES IN ATTEMPTING TO CAPTURE WHOM GORSUCH WAS KILLED NEAR CHRISTIANA WERE BROUGHT TO THEM AT MIDNIGHT BY DR FUSSELL
SHE BELONGED TO ELIZA H
STILL--DEAR SIR:--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING THESE FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM WELL AND HOPE THAT THEY MAY FIND YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ENJOYING THE SAME GOOD HEALTH
BUT THOSE WHO DID LOOK IN UPON IT TESTIFIED HER WORTH IN TERMS SO STRONG AS SHOWED HOW DEEPLY IT IMPRESSED THEM
THE TIMES ARE VERY DULL AT PRESENT AND HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE I CAME HERE
THEY WERE BOTH OWNED BY A FARMER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF DAVID STEWART AND RESIDED IN MARYLAND
FUNERAL SERVICE ON SATURDAY
MARY COOPER AND MOSES ARMSTEAD 1857
MARY COOPER AND MOSES ARMSTEAD 1857
JOHN FLED FROM SOUTH CAROLINA
IN SOME RESPECTS IT IS WITHOUT A PARALLEL
ALSO THAT THIS SAME WAVERTON HAD ON A LATE OCCASION BROUGHT HIS HEAVY FIST VIOLENTLY AGAINST HER JAWS WHICH VISITATION HOWEVER KINDLY INTENDED BY HER CHIVALROUS MASTER PRODUCED SUCH AN UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON THE MIND OF ELIZA THAT SHE AT ONCE DETERMINED NOT TO YIELD SUBMISSION TO HIM A DAY LONGER THAN SHE COULD FIND AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CONDUCTOR WHO WOULD TAKE HER NORTH
THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE SHORTLY AFTER THAT
THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO HOPE TO MEET EACH OTHER IN CANADA
BUT HERE I WAS TAKEN UP AND CARRIED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE
FROM AN HOUR TO AN HOUR AND A HALF PASSED IN THESE PARLEYINGS ANGRY CONVERSATIONS AND THREATS
SO SOON AS WE GOT THE LETTER AND COULD GET OFF TWO OF US WERE ABOUT SETTING OFF TO RENDER ALL POSSIBLE AID WHEN WE WERE TOLD THEY ALL HAD PASSED A FEW HOURS BEFORE THROUGH PRINCETON MR CONCKLIN IN CHAINS
ABRAM GALLOWAY EVEN UNDER THIS MASTER WHO WAS A MAN OF VERY GOOD DISPOSITION ABRAM WAS NOT CONTENTED
HALL JOS JR 313
WHILE IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF MR JOHNSTON AND HIS COADJUTORS TO RENDER ANY GREAT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL AID TO THE COMMITTEE AS THEY HAD NOT BEEN LARGELY BLESSED WITH THIS WORLD'S GOODS NEVERTHELESS THE SYMPATHY SHOWN WAS AS HIGHLY VALUED AS IF THEY HAD GIVEN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
HARRISBURG MAY 26 56
THE VERY NAME OF SLAVERY MADE THE FIRE FAIRLY BURN IN HIS BONES
THERE IS NO USE OF GETTING A DOCTOR FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY THERE COULD BE NO OTHER FATE FOR THE OLD MAN BUT TO SUFFER AND DIE WITH CREEPERS IN HIS LEGS IT WAS SICKENING TO HEAR HIM NARRATE INSTANCES OF SIMILAR SUFFERING IN THE CASE OF OLD SLAVES
CANNON ANSAL 500
BOTH HAD GOOD MANNERS AND A FAIR SHARE OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH AFFORDED A HOPEFUL FUTURE FOR THEM IN FREEDOM
PLEASE TELL MRS STILL I HAVE NOT MET ANY PERSON WHO HAS TREATED ME ANY KINDER THAN SHE DID SINCE I LEFT
WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN WAS SHE A
NOT TO INFORM THE PUBLIC WHAT IT KNOWS VERY WELL ALREADY NOR TO FORESTALL THE VOLUME NOW PREPARING BY MRS CHILD A KINDRED SPIRIT BUT TO GRATIFY MY OWN FEELINGS AND TO GIVE GRACE AND SANCTITY TO THIS LITTLE BOOK I WISH TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF MR HOPPER THE DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE PRISONER AS OF THE SLAVE
BEFORE ANN MARIA WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE $700 WAS OFFERED FOR HER BY A FRIEND WHO DESIRED TO PROCURE HER FREEDOM BUT THE OFFER WAS PROMPTLY REFUSED AS WERE SUCCEEDING ONES REPEATEDLY MADE

SCARCELY HAD THE CORDIAL GREETINGS OF THE WRITER AND HIS FAMILY ENDED AND THE DAUGHTER OF BROWN BEEN INTRODUCED BEFORE THE WRITER WAS PLYING HIS REFUGEE GUEST WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO HIS SOJOURN IN CANADA ETC
HE HAD INVESTED TO THE EXTENT OF TWELVE HEAD
WITHOUT WE HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF NEARLY THREE MILLIONS OF THE HUMAN RACE
SADLER THE KEEPER OF AN OYSTER HOUSE HELD THE DEED FOR JOE AND A MOST HEARTLESS WRETCH HE WAS IN JOE'S ESTIMATION
THEIR NARRATIVES WILL THEREFORE BE BRIEF
I SHOULD LIE KNOW HOW TIMES IS HENRY TURNER IF YOU GET THIS KEEP IT AND READ IT TO YOURSELF AND NOT LET ANY ONE ELSE BUT YOURSELF TELL ANN HENRY SAMUEL HENRY JACOB BRYANT WM CLATON MR JAMES AT ALMIRA RECEVED AT MR JONES HOUSE THE BEST I COULD I HAVE BEEN HEALTHY SINCE I ARRIVED HERE
I AM NOT MAKING MUCH MONEY AND PERHAPS WILL HARDLY CLEAR EXPENSES THIS WINTER
A LITTLE MONEY FROM ALL MY FRIENDS WOULD SOON REINSTATE ME AND WHEN THEY SEE MY PAPER I TRUST IT WILL CHEER THEIR HOPES AND CAUSE A NEW FIRE FOR LIBERTY IN KENTUCKY
THE SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION FROM WHICH THESE TRAVELERS FLED HAD AFFORDED THEM NO PRIVILEGES IN THE WAY OF LEARNING TO READ
WILLIAM STILL ESQ MY DEAR SIR:--IN ANSWER TO YOUR REQUEST THAT I WOULD FURNISH AN ARTICLE FOR YOUR FORTHCOMING BOOK GIVING INCIDENTS WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF BENEVOLENCE HE MANIFESTED THE SAME ZEALOUS KINDNESS AND UNTIRING DILIGENCE THAT HAD SO LONG BEEN EXERTED FOR THE COLORED PEOPLE FOR WHOSE WELFARE HE LABORED TO THE END OF HIS DAYS
ONE WAS MY BROTHER PERRY AND THE OTHER WAS A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF JIM DAVID MY MASTER DRANK ALL HE COULD GET POURED IT DOWN AND WHEN DRUNK WOULD CUSS AND TEAR AND RIP AND BEAT
THE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS OF C
IT WILL BE SEEN BY THE APPENDED LETTER OF THOMAS GARRETT THAT WILLIAM HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THIS TRIED FRIEND BY WHOM HE WAS AIDED TO PHILADELPHIA
BUT TO PROVE BY THEIR INDUSTRY UPRIGHTNESS ECONOMY SOBRIETY AND THRIFT BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR FORMER DAYS OF OPPRESSION AND THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR GOD THAT THEY WERE WORTHY OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH THEY WERE GOING AND SO TO HELP BREAK THE BANDS OF THE OPPRESSORS AND UNDO THE HEAVY BURDENS OF THE OPPRESSED SIMILAR ADVICE WAS IMPRESSED UPON THE MINDS OF ALL TRAVELERS PASSING OVER THIS BRANCH OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
WE RESPECTFULLY COMMEND THESE GENTLEMEN AND THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY ARE ENGAGED TO THE CONFIDENCE AND CO-OPERATION OF ALL THE FRIENDS OF THE HUNTED FUGITIVE
ISAAC NEWTON HAILED FROM RICHMOND VIRGINIA
THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN EVERY COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY PRIVATE OR PUBLIC
THE KNOWLEDGE HE THUS ACQUIRED TOGETHER WITH HIS PRACTICAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE BUSINESS AND DECISIONS OF OUR COURTS RENDERED HIS OPINION PECULIARLY SERVICEABLE ON ALL MATTERS AFFECTING THEIR RIGHTS
PLEASE WRITE TO ME IMMEDIATELY ON RECEIPT OF THIS AND SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL CHEER UP MY DROOPING SPIRITS
A WIDER SPREAD SYMPATHY WOULD MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE CAUSE BE VISIBLY PROMOTED
WHOSE HEART WENT OUT AFTER THE MILLIONS IN FETTERS THE FLEEING FUGITIVE THE FREE PROSCRIBED THE IGNORANT DEPRIVED OF EDUCATION
MARTHA'S MASTER WAS REPRESENTED AS A VERY BARBAROUS AND CRUEL MAN TO THE SLAVES
HE WAS QUITE A LONG-BODIED THIN-FACED MAN WEIGHING OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS
THE NIGGERS ARE NOT WORTH A D----N NOR WAS HIS WIFE ANY BETTER IN JACOB'S OPINION
RICHARD WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN
IN THIS MISSION SHE HAS COME IN CONTACT WITH ALL CLASSES--THE ORIGINAL SLAVEHOLDERS AND THE FREEDMEN BEFORE AND SINCE THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT BILL WAS ENACTED
JAMES M
IN MANY INSTANCES AFTER HEARING THE MOST PAINFUL NARRATIVES WE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO WRITE THEM OUT EXCEPT IN THE BRIEFEST MANNER SIMPLY SUFFICIENT TO IDENTIFY PARTIES WHICH WE DID NOT DREAMING THAT THE DARK CLOUD OF SLAVERY WAS SO SOON TO GIVE WAY TO THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OF FREEDOM
STILL:--THIS IS TO INFORM YOU THAT MYSELF AND LITTLE BOY ARRIVED SAFELY IN THIS CITY THIS DAY THE 24TH AT TEN O'CLOCK AFTER A VERY LONG AND PLEASANT TRIP
ANOTHER LETTER OF HIS REMARKS WHEN SPEAKING OF THEM
ISAIAH ROBINSON ARTHUR SPENCE CAROLINE TAYLOR AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS NANCY AND MARY

UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS
BEFORE FRIENDS AND FOES THE LEARNED AND THE UNLEARNED NORTH AND SOUTH MRS HARPER HAS PLEADED THE CAUSE OF HER RACE IN A MANNER THAT HAS COMMANDED THE GREATEST RESPECT
THRUST THE WRETCHED CAPTIVE STRANGER
WILLIAM JAMES CONNER WITH HIS WIFE CHILD AND FOUR BROTHERS
SOME OF THE SHOT WILL REMAIN IN THEM AS LONG AS LIFE LASTS
FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE THE SLAVES HAD CONSTANTLY BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THEIR MISTRESS PROMISES TO BELIEVE THAT AT HER DEATH ALL WOULD BE FREE AND TRANSPORTED TO LIBERIA WHERE THEY WOULD ENJOY THEIR LIBERTY AND BE HAPPY THE REMAINDER OF THEIR DAYS
THEY TRIED TO GET HIM TO CONTENT HIMSELF UNDER THE YOKE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE THE POINT
I THEN BORROWED FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON MY OWN INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT AND ASSISTED MANY OTHERS TO GO TO A LAND WHERE THE VIRGIN SOIL WAS NOT POLLUTED BY THE FOOT-PRINTS OF A SLAVE
SHE WAS NOT TOLD HOWEVER HOW MUCH SHE WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH ON THE WAY ELSE ACCORDING TO HER OWN ADMISSION SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE COME AS SHE DID
NOR WAS ANY FAULT FOUND WITH HIS MISTRESS SO FAR AS HER TREATMENT OF HIM WAS CONCERNED
THOSE WERE STIRRING TIMES AND THE PEOPLE OF DOVER DELAWARE WILL LONG REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN S.D
THE OTHERS ALLUDED TO PASSED ON TO CANADA DIRECT
TO WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN
IF YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO MR BIGLOW SHE WISHES YOU WOULD
PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT THE TWO CHILDREN WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHER SHE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO LIVE WITH HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN INDEPENDENTLY OF HER MASTER BY SUPPORTING HERSELF AND THEM WITH THE WHITE-WASH BRUSH WASH-TUB ETC
BUT SUCH DIRECT PROOF OF THIS ELEMENT OF THE OFFENCE IS NOT LEGALLY NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH ITS EXISTENCE
TRUSTING IT WILL BE ACCEPTABLE AND BE THE MEANS OF ASSISTING THE POOR FUGITIVE ON HIS PERILOUS WAY YOU HAVE THE PRAYERS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT YOU MAY BE PROSPERED IN YOUR WORK OF MERCY AND YOU SURELY WILL MEET WITH YOUR REWARD ACCORDING TO YOUR MERCIFUL ACTS
MY HEART BLEEDS WHEN I THINK OF THOSE POOR HUNTED AND HEART-BROKEN FUGITIVES THOUGH A MOST INTERESTING FAMILY TAKEN BACK TO BONDAGE TEN-FOLD WORSE THAN EGYPTIAN
ONE OF THE MOST ENCOURAGING SIGNS CONNECTED WITH THE TRAVEL VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WAS THAT PASSENGERS TRAVELING THEREON WERE AS A GENERAL THING YOUNG AND OF DETERMINED MINDS
RUNNING AWAY WAS THE CRIME
HIS NAME IS JAMES B
TO WM
TO WM
TO WM
TO WM
SO IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THIS TROUBLESOME CUSTOMER THE CAR WAS RUN OFF THE TRACK THE SHIVERING PASSENGERS ALL LEAVING IT AS THOUGH FLYING FROM A PLAGUE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MILES HIS WIFE AND ANOTHER COLORED GENTLEMAN WHO GOT ON WITH MILES
THE VERY DAY THAT JACK FLED FOUR MEN APPROACHED HIM THE DOCTOR ONE OF THEM WITH LINE IN HAND
THE ACTING COMMITTEE WAS THUS CONSTITUTED
THAT NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED WITH HIS MAN
ONE DAY WHILE HAULING DIRT WITH A FRACTIOUS HORSE THE ANIMAL MANIFESTED AN UNWILLINGNESS TO PERFORM HIS DUTY SATISFACTORILY
JEREMIAH COULD CLAIM TO HAVE NO MIXTURE IN HIS BLOOD AS HIS COLOR WAS OF SUCH A PURE BLACK
WHILE IT WAS SAD TO THINK THAT MILLIONS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WERE LIABLE TO JUST SUCH BRUTAL OUTRAGES AS THOMAS HAD RECEIVED IT WAS A SATISFACTION TO THINK THAT THIS OUTRAGE HAD MADE A FREEMAN OF HIM
YOU WILL PLEASE GIVE MY RESPECTS TO MRS STILL AND FAMILY
TORONTO MAY 7,1854
CHARLOTTE AND HARRIET ESCAPE IN DEEP MOURNING--WHITE LADY AND CHILD WITH A COLORED COACHMAN--THREE LIKELY YOUNG MEN FROM BALTIMORE--FOUR LARGE AND TWO SMALL HAMS--U.G.R.R

HE OWNED THREE
PORTSMOUTH VA LOST ONE OF HER MOST SUBSTANTIAL LABORERS IN THE PERSON OF MOSES AND MADAM ABIGAIL WHEELER A VERY LIKELY ARTICLE OF MERCHANDISE
THE OFFICERS YIELDED AND ANTHONY WENT WILLINGLY TO THE JAIL
HE CONTRASTED FAVORABLY WITH GEORGE BEING ABOUT TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WITH A COUNTENANCE INDICATIVE OF INTELLIGENCE AND SPIRIT
ASHMEAD ESQ MR COMMISSIONER INGRAHAM AND RECORDER LEE ACCOMPANIED BY THE UNITED STATES MARINES RETURNED TO THE CITY
THE DEVIL WAS INTO HIM AND HE FLOGGED AND BEAT FOUR OF THE SLAVES ONE MAN AND THREE OF THE WOMEN AND SAID IF HE COULD ONLY GET HOLD OF ME HE WOULDN'T STRIKE ME NARY-A-LICK BUT WOULD TIE ME TO A TREE AND EMPTY BOTH BARRELS INTO ME
DARIUS ALLEGED THAT THIS SAME HAMLIN WHO HAD THUS STRIPPED HIM OF EVERY CENT OF HIS EARNINGS WAS DOING THE SAME THING BY SIXTY OTHERS WHOM HE HELD IN HIS GRASP
NOBLE OLD MAN SO PURE AND PEACEFUL AND YET SO STRONG FIRM AND FEARLESS SO GENTLE TENDER AND TRUTHFUL AFRAID AND ASHAMED OF NOTHING BUT SIN AND IN LOVE AND LABOR WITH EVERY GOOD WORK
AND THOUGH THE TIME IS NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY DISTANT FROM THE DATE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE TO GIVE TO THIS RECORD THE UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE IT DESERVES THERE ARE FEW WE THINK EVEN NOW WHO CAN READ IT WITHOUT AMAZEMENT THAT SUCH THINGS COULD BE IN OUR VERY DAY AND BE REGARDED WITH SUCH GENERAL APATHY
ALBERTI A NOTORIOUS KIDNAPPER AND E.D
SHE WAS HEART AND SOUL WITH JOHN IN ALL HIS PLANS WHICH LOOKED CANADA-WARD
I WAS TO DELIVER A MESSAGE--HE IS NOT HERE
I KNOW SOME ONE HERE THAT HAVE WRITTEN HIS MASTER TO COME AFTER HIM BUT NOT BECAUSE HE EXPECT TO GO WITH HIM HOME BUT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO RETALEATE UPON HIS PERSECUTOR BUT I WOULD BE SORRY FOR MAN THAT HAVE WRITTEN FOR HIS MASTER EXPECTING TO RETURN WITH HIM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HERE WOULD KILL THEM
BUT THE STORY OF WRONG WOULD WORK UPON HIM
I FEEL REJOICED THAT HE IS SOON TO BE FREE AND WITH ME AND OF COURSE FEEL THE GREATEST SOLICITUDE ABOUT RAISING THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS I HAVE BORROWED OF A KIND FRIEND OR WHO HAS BORROWED IT FOR ME AT BANK
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY WIFE WRITE TO ME A FEW LINES BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY

HAMILTON MARCH 25TH 1856
THE ESCAPE OF HEZEKIAH HILL
YET IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE CITY IS FULL OF INCENDIARIES PERHAPS YOU ARE AWARE THAT ANY COLORED CITIZEN IS LIABLE AT ANY HOUR OF DAY OR NIGHT WITHOUT ANY SHOW OF AUTHORITY TO HAVE HIS HOUSE RANSACKED BY CONSTABLES AND IF OTHERS DO IT AND COMMIT THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS DEPREDATIONS NONE BUT WHITE WITNESSES CAN CONVICT THEM
THESE TRIALS SHE SAYS IN EARLY LIFE WERE NOT WITHOUT THEIR GOOD EFFECT IN DISCIPLINING THE MIND AND LEADING IT TO SET A JUST ESTIMATE ON WORLDLY PLEASURES TO THIS EARLY TRAINING TO THE EXAMPLE OF A NOBLE FATHER AND EXCELLENT MOTHER TO THE TRIALS WHICH CAME SO QUICKLY IN HER LIFE THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF MRS MOTT'S INTELLECT IS NO DOUBT GREATLY DUE
THE MARKS OF SLAVERY UPON THEM WERE EVIDENT
YOUR FRIEND AND WELL WISHER EDMUND TURNER
MEN WHOSE EXAMPLE A WHOLE PEOPLE MAY SAFELY IMITATE
SHE FINALLY MARRIED AND SETTLED IN WEST CHESTER WHERE THE PAIR PROSPERED AND WERE SOON SURROUNDED BY THE COMFORTS OF A NEAT HOME
THEN AGAIN THEY GOT THE FINE FOR POCKET MONEY AND LIKEWISE THE STILL GREATER PLEASURE OF ADMINISTERING THE FLOGGING
I AM AFRAID HE WILL LOITER ABOUT AND BE TAKEN--DO MAKE THEM GO ON FAST--HE HAS LEFT
PROBABLY THE LOOSE SHEET ON WHICH THE ITEMS WERE JOTTED DOWN WAS LOST
SHE IS MUCH DISTRESSED AT YOUR CONDUCT
SHE EXPLAINED THAT THE DR HAD STRICTLY CHARGED HER NOT TO OWN TO ANY PERSON EXCEPT THE WRITER THAT SHE WAS FROM WASHINGTON BUT FROM YORK
FROM VIRGINIA MARYLAND DELAWARE NORTH CAROLINA WASHINGTON D.C
SO FAR AS HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS WERE CONCERNED HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A MAN NAMED MR ROBERT HOLLAN HAD ASSUMED TO IMPOSE HIMSELF UPON HIM AS MASTER AND THAT THIS SAME MAN HAD ALSO WRONGFULLY CLAIMED ALL HIS TIME DENIED HIM ALL COMMON AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGES

JIM DOES NOT MAKE ANY SERIOUS COMPLAINT AGAINST HIS MASTER EXCEPT THAT HE HAD HIM IN THE MARKET FOR SALE
FOR A LESSON TO US IN COURAGE IT IS WORTH WHILE TO ASK HOW THESE APOSTLES OF FREEDOM STOOD THE TERRIBLE STRAIN PUT UPON THEM FOR SO MANY YEARS
BUT ALAS FOR THE SLAVE-HOLDER
ONE BLADDER OF WATER AND A FEW SMALL BISCUITS
HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT THE LASH ON HIS BACK BUT NEVERTHELESS HE HAD FELT DEEPLY ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
WHO WOULD NOT COMMEND SUCH A MISTRESS FOR THE PUNCTUALITY IF NOTHING MORE
THE PROMPTINGS OF INTEREST THE PLEASURES AND ALLUREMENTS OF THE WORLD THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF A PEACEFUL HOME WERE ALL CHEERFULLY SACRIFICED WHEN HIS SERVICES WERE DEMANDED IN THESE DISTRESSING CASES
TELL MY MOTHER AND BROTHER AND ALL ENQUIRING FRIENDS THAT I AM NOW SAFE IN FREE STATE
SHE HAD BEEN WHIPT RIGHT SMART POORLY FED AND POORLY CLOTHED BY A CERTAIN ROGER MCZANT OF THE NEW MARKET DISTRICT EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND
HIS EFFORTS OF COURSE BROUGHT HIM MUCH PERSECUTION AND ANNOYANCE BUT NEVER CULMINATED IN ANYTHING REALLY SERIOUS UNTIL ABOUT THE YEAR 1846 OR 47
FOR A LONG WHILE THE INTEREST WAS KEPT ALIVE AND EVEN AS LATELY AS THE PAST YEAR 1870 WE FIND THE CASE STILL AGITATING THE CITIZENS OF CHESTER COUNTY
IT IS THE CAUSE OF TRUTH OF HUMANITY AND OF GOD TO WHICH WE INVITE YOUR AID
OF HER STORY NOTHING OF ANY MOMENT WAS RECORDED
THEY MUST HAVE HAD REASON SO TO THINK JUDGING FROM THE HARD SWEARING THEY DID BEFORE THE COMMITTING MAGISTRATE
I WOULD LIKE FOR MY FRIEND HENRY LOVEY TO SEND MY WIFE RIGHT ON TO PHILADELPHIA

HE FLED BACK TO THE HOUSE PURSUED BY THE SLAVE-HUNTERS WHO ENTERED THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE BUT WERE UNABLE TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE UPPER PART TO WHICH THE FAMILY HAD RETIRED
I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOUSE OF A COLORED FRIEND TO DESCRIBE THE FUGITIVE AND SEE IF WE COULD NOT CONCERT MEASURES TO PROTECT HIM
MAY HE WHO GUIDES THE DESTINIES OF NATIONS AND WITHOUT WHOSE AID THEY LABOR IN VAIN THAT BUILD SO INCLINE YOUR HEARTS TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE INFLUENCE TO PLACE IN ALL OUR PUBLIC OFFICES JUST AND GOOD MEN THAT OUR COUNTRY MAY BE PRESERVED HER BEST INTERESTS ADVANCED AND HER INSTITUTIONS FREE IN REALITY AS IN NAME HANDED DOWN TO THE LATEST POSTERITY IS NOT THE LOVE OF GOD AND MAN INGRAINED IN EVERY LINE OF THIS WRITING

IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT SUCH A SIGHT ADMITTED OF NO CONTRADICTION--NO ARGUMENT--NO DOUBT
WILLIAM WAS VALUED AT $1,000
THE CONFLICT LASTED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BUT THE VICTORIOUS BONDMEN WERE ONLY MADE ALL THE MORE COURAGEOUS BY SEEING THE FOE RETREAT
MR MCKIM RAPPED QUIETLY ON THE LID OF THE BOX AND CALLED OUT ALL RIGHT INSTANTLY CAME THE ANSWER FROM WITHIN ALL RIGHT SIR THE WITNESSES WILL NEVER FORGET THAT MOMENT

ROBERT WAS BORN IN MARTINSBURG VA AND WAS OWNED BY PHILIP PENDLETON

TURNER SAMUEL 429
THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL FEELING IN THE NORTH THAT EVERY CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF THOSE WHO HAD SO RECENTLY AND MARVELLOUSLY BEEN ENFRANCHISED
THIS MORNING AFTER EIGHT I GOT YOUR LETTER OF THE 9TH BUT IT GIVES ME BUT LITTLE ENLIGHTENMENT OR SATISFACTION
I THEN DREW A SWORD I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME AND WAS ABOUT CUTTING MY WAY TO THE DOOR WHEN I WAS SHOT BY ONE OF THE MEN RECEIVING THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF ONE LOAD OF A DOUBLE BARRELED GUN IN MY LEFT ARM THAT BEING THE ARM WITH WHICH I WAS DEFENDING MYSELF
AS THE MATTER OF FREEDOM HAD BEEN IN THEIR MINDS FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAD FREQUENTLY COUNTED THE COST AND HAD BEEN LAYING BY TRIFLING SUMS OF MONEY WHICH HAD FALLEN PERCHANCE INTO THEIR HANDS
MY HEART LEAPED FOR JOY WHEN I FOUND WE WERE GOING TO A FREE STATE
THEY WENT ANOTHER WAY
AFTER READING IT HE ASKED SAMUEL IF HE WAS A SLAVE
SO THAT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SECOND WITNESS ON THE PART OF THE DEFENSE JANE JOHNSON WAS CALLED FOR IN A SHRILL VOICE
IN THIS DILEMMA THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY THE CAPTAIN OF AN OYSTER BOAT WHOSE SENSE OF HUMANITY WAS SO STRONGLY APPEALED TO BY THEIR APPEARANCE THAT HE ENGAGED TO PILOT THEM TO PHILADELPHIA
THE WIND OF HEAVEN FAVORING THE GOOD CAUSE HE ARRIVED SAFELY IN DUE TIME AND DELIVERED HIS PRECIOUS FREIGHT IN THE VICINITY OF PHILADELPHIA WITHIN THE REACH OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
MR PARLANGE WENT ON HIS WAY TO NEW YORK VIA THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD AND UPON HIS ARRIVAL AT THE WALNUT STREET WHARF WITH TWO LADIES JIM WAS MISSING
I AM TOLD AS A SECRET THAT THIS SUBJECT IS LIKELY ERE LONG TO BE TAKEN UP IN HIGH QUARTERS IN ENGLAND
BUT SUCH AS I HAVE GIVE I THEE 1
HE HAS GOT INTO A GOOD PLACE TO WORK IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
ESPECIALLY WAS THIS THE CASE WHEN IT BECAME THE DUTY OF EVERY LOVER OF HIS KIND TO DEFY THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
IT WAS WRITTEN TO ROBERT J
WHEAT
CHARLES HAD SCARCELY BEEN THREE HOURS IN THIS PLACE HOWEVER BEFORE THREE OFFICERS CAME IN SEARCH OF HIM
BEALE ESQ OF FAUQUIER COUNTY VA
CHURCH NEXT AROSE AND SAID THAT HE CAME THERE INTENDING TO SAY NOTHING BUT THE SCENE MOVED HIM TO A FEW WORDS
TAKE HIM ALL FOR ALL THERE WILL RARELY BE FOUND IN ONE MAN MORE UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE AND JUSTICE THAN WAS POSSESSED BY THE SUBJECT OF THIS NOTICE
HOW MUCH JOY WAS FELT AT THE ARRIVAL OF A FUGITIVE AND THE INTENSE SADNESS EXPERIENCED OVER THE NEWS OF A FAILURE OR CAPTURE OF A SLAVE
NOT LONG BEFORE ESCAPING SHE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION-BLOCK
THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE COMMITTEE'S LETTER RELATIVE TO THIS MATTER IS OPEN TO THIS INFERENCE AND MAY SERVE TO THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT
BOSTON OCT
YOU WILL INQUIRE WHETHER AN OFFENCE HAS BEEN COMMITTED WHAT WAS ITS LEGAL CHARACTER AND WHO WERE THE OFFENDERS,--AND THIS DONE AND THIS ONLY YOU WILL MAKE YOUR PRESENTMENTS ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE AND THE LAW
FOR A LENGTH OF TIME THE NOTION OF LEAVING AND GOING TO CANADA WAS UPPERMOST IN HIS HEART
WHILST EVERY PULSE WAS BEATING STRONG FOR LIBERTY ONLY ONE CHANCE SEEMED TO BE LEFT THE TRIAL OF WHICH REQUIRED AS MUCH COURAGE AS IT WOULD TO ENDURE THE CUTTING OFF THE RIGHT ARM OR PLUCKING OUT THE RIGHT EYE
ACCORDINGLY HE SELECTED A YOUNG SLAVE MAN FOR HIS VICTIM AND FLOGGED HIM SO CRUELLY THAT HE COULD SCARCELY WALK OR STAND AND TO KEEP FROM BEING ACTUALLY KILLED THE BOY TOLD AN UNTRUTH AND CONFESSED THAT HE AND HIS UNCLE HENRY KILLED WEBSTER THE OVERSEER
HE WAS NEITHER COLORED NOR WHITE

EQUALLY DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO EXPRESS THE INTEREST FELT BY THE COMMITTEE IN THIS PASSENGER AND HIS WONDERFUL HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPE
HIS LIFE AND LABORS WERE A DAILY PROTEST AGAINST THE TRAFFIC OF RUM
I SAW THREE OR FOUR COLORED PERSONS IN THE HALL AT BLOODGOOD'S NONE OF WHOM I RECOGNIZED EXCEPT THE BOY WHO BROUGHT ME THE NOTE

ANOTHER WITNESS NAMED ZACHARIAH BOWEN FOR THE CLAIMANTS SWORE POSITIVELY THAT HE KNEW THE PRISONER WELL THAT SHE HAD BEEN HIRED TO HIS BROTHER FOR THREE YEARS BY DR PURNELL WHOSE SLAVE SHE WAS
BESIDES THE FAVORABLENESS OF THE WEATHER TENDED ALSO TO MAKE TRAVEL MORE PLEASANT THAN IN COLDER SEASONS OF THE YEAR
THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE LOVE OF LIBERTY WAS CLEARLY INDICATED IN HIS EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE
I WILL RELATE ONE
HAD HE CONSULTED HIS EASE OR CONVENIENCE AND DEFERRED HIS VISIT TO NEWARK A FEW HOURS OR HAD HE AS MOST MEN UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE DONE REPOSED HIS WEARY LIMBS AFTER A COLD AND DREARY RIDE OF EIGHTY MILES IN ORDER TO ENABLE HIM TO RETURN WITH RENEWED STRENGTH HE WOULD HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE TO RENDER THIS MERITORIOUS EFFORT EFFECTUAL
MARIA WAS APPRAISED AT $800

TORANTO MARCH 8TH 1854
AT LEAST I BELIEVE SOME OF THE COLORED PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER CONTRACTS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S LESS MURDERING
THEY LEARNED WHEN THE VESSEL WOULD START AND THAT SHE WAS LOADED WITH TAR ROSIN AND SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE AMONGST WHICH THE CAPTAIN WAS TO SECRETE THEM
AS THE SOLE AIM APPARENT IN THIS CASE WAS FREEDOM FOR THE SLAVE THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED THESE TRAVELLERS AS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS
HE MUST NOT BE LEFT OUT
IN ORDER TO AVOID SUSPICION THE WOMAN INTENDING TO BE SECRETED APPROACHED THE BOAT WITH A CLEAN IRONED SHIRT ON HER ARM BARE HEADED AND IN HER USUAL WORKING DRESS LOOKING GOOD-NATURED OF COURSE AND AS IF SHE WERE SIMPLY CONVEYING THE SHIRT TO ONE OF THE MEN ON THE BOAT

THE COMMISSIONER CONSIDERING THE TESTIMONY SUFFICIENT ORDERED THEIR SURRENDER AND THEY WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN UP TO THEIR CLAIMANTS WHO HURRIED THEM OFF AT ONCE AND THEY ARE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO BALTIMORE
WHAT MASTER RAUTTY SAID WHEN HE FOUND HIS PROPERTY GONE WITH THE HANDCUFFS WE KNOW NOT
AFTER I SAW HIM IN MARKET STREET AT CONGRESS HALL IN OUR ROOM
CLOTHING AND CREATURE COMFORTS WERE FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE AND DELIGHT AND JOY FILLED ALL HEARTS IN THAT STRONGHOLD OF PHILANTHROPY
CONSEQUENTLY AS SHE WAS BUT LITTLE KNOWN BEING A YOUNG AND HOMELESS MAIDEN AN EXILE BY LAW NO ESPECIAL ENCOURAGEMENT WAS TENDERED HER BY ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA
CERTAINLY THIS WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN LOOKING AT THIS MULTITUDE SHE WOULD SAY SURELY THIS ALSO WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN
ABOUT THE YEAR 1831 OR 1832 MR JOSEPH PURVIS A YOUNGER BROTHER OF ROBERT PURVIS ABOUT NINETEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WAS VISITING MR STEPHEN SMITH OF COLUMBIA AND WHILE THERE THE CLAIMANTS OF DORSEY CAME AND SECURED HIM AND HAD PROCEEDED ABOUT TWO MILES WITH HIM ON THE WAY TO LANCASTER

AND I CAUSED THE WIDOW'S HEART TO SING FOR JOY
MY MASTER WAS WANTING TO KEEP ME IN THE DARK ABOUT TAKING THEM FOR FEAR THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN

AM ASHAMED THAT I WAS SO INCONSIDERATE OF THE POOR RUNAWAYS
AFTER HAVING ONCE ENLISTED THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH OR DIE OF COURSE HARRIET WAS SUPREME AND HER FOLLOWERS GENERALLY HAD FULL FAITH IN HER AND WOULD BACK UP ANY WORD SHE MIGHT UTTER
IT IS THE STORY OF SCORES OF HEROES--HEROES THAT EQUALLED DOUGLASS IN NERVE AND LOGAN IN TACT AND EXCELLED EITHER IN THRILLING ADVENTURE
BUT WHEN I REMEMBER THAT IT MORE OFTEN PLEADED THAN STORMED THAT IT PENETRATED INTO EVERY SECRET RECESS THAT MERCY CASUALLY OPENED AND GENTLY STIRRED INTO FULLER LIFE THOSE ROOTS OF HUMAN FEELING THAT CAN BE NUMBED BY APATHY BUT NOT KILLED EVEN BY HATE I KNOW THAT IT WAS PERSUASIVE DIFFUSIVE INBREATHING FORCE AN INFLUENCE VITAL IN OTHERS BECAUSE AN EFFLUENCE VITALIZED FROM THEMSELVES
FOR IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM HIM SOON WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT HE IS LOST AND THE REPORT OF HIS ESCAPE ALL A HOAX
TO-DAY I WRITE TO YOU IN A LOWLY CABIN WHERE THE WINDOWS IN THE ROOM ARE FORMED BY TWO APERTURES IN THE WALL
BY LOVE OF JUSTICE BY CONSTANT DEVOTION TO A GREAT CAUSE AND BY AN UNFALTERING FAITH THAT THAT WHICH IS RIGHT WILL IN THE END SUCCEED
WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM DURING THOSE MANY WEEKS OF HIS PERILOUS LABORS IN ALABAMA TO RESCUE THIS FAMILY WAS TO NONE A GREATER MYSTERY THAN TO HIS SISTERS
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THEM ARE THE ONES THEE WROTE ABOUT WHO WANTED DR LUNDY TO COME FOR THEM AND PROMISED THEY WOULD PAY HIS EXPENSES

FREEMAN THOS 168
SHE HAS BENT OVER THE FORM OF LOVELY CHILDHOOD AND SUFFERED IT TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE REDEEMER'S ARMS
WHAT MORE SAVIOUR_-LIKE THAN THE WILLING SACRIFICE HE HAS RENDERED
SEEING THAT SLAVES WERE TREATED NO BETTER THAN DOGS AND HOGS JOHN THOUGHT THAT HE WAS NONE TOO YOUNG TO BE TAKING STEPS TO GET AWAY
IT WAS LEMUEL'S OPINION THAT HIS MASTER'S WIFE MADE HIM WORSE THAN HE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN
NEITHER I NOR MY ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS HERE CAN EXPRESS OUR THANKFULNESS IN THE ELEGANT LANGUAGE YOUR BETTER EDUCATED COUNTRYMEN MAY FEEL WE SHOULD USE BUT BY THE OMNIPOTENT JUDGE OF ALL HEARTS I TRUST OUR FEEBLE EFFORT WILL BE ACCEPTED AND YOU AND YOURS BE BLESSED AND PROTECTED NOW AND FOR EVER
IN CONCLUSION WE MAY ADD THAT MORE THAN MOST MEN HE BORE ABOUT WITH HIM THE SENTIMENT OF THAT OLD ROMAN NIHIL HUMANUM ALIENUM A ME PUTO WHILE HE ADDED TO IT THE HIGHER THOUGHT OF THE CHRISTIAN THAT HE WHO LOVETH GOD LOVETH HIS BROTHER ALSO
THE MEN ALL RAN EXCEPT HAINES WHO KEPT ROBERT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND JOHN SO THAT JOHN SHOULD NOT SHOOT HIM

PRESENTED MY CARD LAST NIGHT ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT WHICH I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED
CHASKEY IS ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK MEDIUM SIZE SOUND BODY AND INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE NEVERTHELESS HE RESEMBLED A FARM HAND IN EVERY PARTICULAR
THERE WAS SOMETHING TOUCHING IN HER ATTITUDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE
BROAD ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS HE IS ABOUT FIVE FEET FIVE OR SIX INCHES HIGH ALWAYS APPEARS TO BE IN A GOOD HUMOR
THERE WAS A WOMAN AND ALSO A FEEBLE OLD MAN IN THE HOUSE WHO WERE ATTRACTED TO THE SPOT BY THE SCUFFLE
ON THE SCORE OF FEEDING AND CLOTHING JOHN GAVE THEM CREDIT SAYING THAT THE CLOTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH THEY LIKED TO SEE THE HOUSE SERVANTS DRESSED HE SPOKE TOO OF THE EATING AS BEING ALL RIGHT BUT ADDED THAT VERY OFTEN TIME WAS NOT ALLOWED THEM TO FINISH THEIR MEALS RESPECTING WORK JOHN BORE WITNESS THAT THEY WERE VERY SHARP
THE EMERGENCY OF THE CASE HOWEVER CRIED LOUDLY FOR AID
LOUISA HARRIET AND GRACE OWED SERVICE TO GEO
TRAVELING CONVERSING ADDRESSING DAY AND SUNDAY-SCHOOLS PICKING UP SCRAPS OF INFORMATION TAKES UP A LARGE PORTION OF MY TIME BESIDES WHAT I GIVE TO READING
THEY ESCAPED FROM WILLIAM PARKER
AT ONE MOMENT SHE WAS THE HOWLING WIND
MR WHEELER WAS BESIDE ME AND I WAS AFRAID
INDEED HE HAD SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HIS MISTRESS EVEN FAR MORE KEENLY THAN FROM THESE UGLY MARKS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE
AS HE HAD BEEN SO LONG DOUBLED UP IN THE BOX HE NEEDED TO PROMENADE CONSIDERABLY IN THE FRESH AIR SO JAMES MOTT PUT ONE OF HIS BROAD-BRIM HATS ON HIS HEAD AND TENDERED HIM THE HOSPITALITIES OF HIS YARD AS WELL AS HIS HOUSE AND WHILE BROWN PROMENADED THE YARD FLUSHED WITH VICTORY GREAT WAS THE JOY OF HIS FRIENDS
FRISLEY ALFRED JAS 138
WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER THE DANGER HE IMMEDIATELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD MAKE A STRUGGLE COST WHAT IT MIGHT
IT WAS ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE BRAVEST HEARTS TO FALTER

A MAN TOLD ME WHERE SHE WAS"--"I BEG THE COURT,"--HERE MR MCMURTRIE INTERPOSED AN OBJECTION TO HIS MENTIONING THE PERSON
BEVERLY GOOD AND GEORGE WALKER ALIAS AUSTIN VALENTINE

DEAR SIR NOTHING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM WRITING IN A CASE OF THIS KIND EXCEPT DEATH
WHILE HE GAVE MALDON CREDIT FOR BEING A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH HE CHARGED HIM WITH TREATING HIMSELF IN A MOST UNCHRISTIAN-LIKE MANNER
AMONG OTHER QUESTIONS THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY COULD READ ETC
LYNCH ALSO TRIED TO CUT THE THROAT OF JOHN WATERS AND SUCCEEDED IN MAKING A FRIGHTFUL GASH ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER MARK SHOWN WHICH MARK HE WILL CARRY WITH HIM TO THE GRAVE

FORMAN ISAAC 64
ARCHER SAM 526
THOUGH THE YOUNG MASTER FOR MARRYING HIS OWN COUSIN AND UNCLE'S DAUGHTER HAD BEEN FOR YEARS THE SUBJECT OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S WRATH AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COME NEAR HIS HOUSE OR TO ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE HOPE OF GETTING ANY OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S ESTATE NEVERTHELESS SCARCELY HAD THE OLD MAN BREATHED HIS LAST ERE THE YOUNG PREACHER SEIZED UPON THE INHERITANCE SLAVES AND ALL
IT WAS AT THIS TIME HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE A SLAVE ANY LONGER
CONSEQUENTLY HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TICKET AND BADE ADIEU TO THAT HOT-BED OF SECESSION SOUTH CAROLINA
RESOLVED THAT WE SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM IN HIS LOSSES AND SUFFERINGS IN THE CAUSE OF THE POOR DOWN-TRODDEN SLAVE
HE WOULD CONFINE THE TESTIMONY EXCLUSIVELY TO THESE TWO COUNTIES AND SHOW THAT SHE IS NOT THE ALLEGED SLAVE
I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY AT PRESENT BUT REMAIN YOOR RESPECTFULLY
BAYLY
THOUGH HE CONSIDERED CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM HIS MASTER A TOLERABLE FAIR MAN HE WAS NOT CONTENT TO BE ROBBED OF HIS LIBERTY AND EARNINGS
HE HELD OUT THE LETTER AND INQUIRED
THE EDITOR HAS BEEN OR IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE MEN OF THE SOUTH
THEN WENT TO THE STEAMBOAT FOR NEW YORK AT 2 O'CLOCK BUT WERE TOO LATE
FROM WILLIAM'S REPORT OF HIS MASTER HE WAS BY NO MEANS AMONG THE WORST OF SLAVE-HOLDERS IN RICHMOND

THE MOTION WAS RIGHT AND SUCCEEDED
HANAWAY WAS VICTORIOUS
HE WAS TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE BLACK GOOD-LOOKING AND POSSESSED VERY GOOD MANNERS
PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECEIPT OF THE LETTER AND BOX AND OBLIGE THE ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY OF ELLINGTON
FOR TWENTY YEARS WILLIAM HAD SERVED IN THE CAPACITY OF A PACKER UNDER MESSRS
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF LATE THAT IF MY FRIENDS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY COULD BE SUPPLIED WITH A SMALL QUARTO AN OCCASIONAL PRINTED PAPER FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION IT WOULD SAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND PROBABLY BRING IN CONSIDERABLE AID
OR IN OTHER WORDS OF THE SYSTEMATIC BUT SECRET EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE ESCAPE OF SLAVES
TO THY GRAVE SORROWING OF HEART THY BRETHREN BORE THEE
UP TO THIS MOMENT THE TWO SISTERS WERE TOTALLY IGNORANT OF THEIR BROTHER'S WHEREABOUTS
THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH WE CAN ACT CONSTITUTIONALLY IS TO GO TO THE BALLOT-BOX AND THERE SILENTLY AND UNOSTENTATIOUSLY DEPOSIT A VOTE FOR SUCH MEN AS WILL DO WHAT THEY CAN TO CARRY OUT THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE SO MUCH AT HEART
JAMES HAD BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION IN FAUQUIER COUNTY VA
GRAY ON MT
BUT HOW THE BETRAYER SHERIFF AND HUNTERS GOT OUT OF THEIR DILEMMA THE COMMITTEE WAS NEVER FULLY POSTED
I SAW HER THERE BEFORE THE CHURCH WAS BUILT
MY HUSBAND AND I ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH A VOLUME MORE CALCULATED TO STIR UP THE BRITISH MIND ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
SLAVERY HE HATED WITH A PERFECT HATRED
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER AND ALSO THREE BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS OWNED BY PRICE
I WAS FOREMAN ON THE FARM
WE WANT TO GIVE THE LITTLE MONEY RAISED IN SUCH A WAY THAT FUGITIVES WHO ARE REALLY NEEDY WILL BE BENEFITED BY IT
KNOCK HIM DOWN
THE SLAVE-HOLDERS EVIDENTLY CONCLUDED THAT HUNN COULD NOT LONGER BE TOLERATED CONSEQUENTLY DEVISED A PLAN TO CAPTURE HIM ON THE CHARGE OF AIDING OFF A WOMAN WITH HER CHILDREN
IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT HE DIED BEFORE THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES WHICH HE HAD SO LONG LABORED FOR ARRIVED
BECAUSE I DELIVERED THE POOR THAT CRIED AND THE FATHERLESS AND HIM THAT HAD NONE TO HELP HIM
DEAR SIR YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY GIVING MY LOVE TO MISS FRANCES WATKINS AND AS SHE SAID SHE HOPED TO BE OUT IN THE SUMMER I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER

FAIR BUSINESS MEN WOULD BE LIKELY TO LOOK AT THIS CONDUCT ON THE PART OF THE TWO GIRLS IN THE LIGHT OF A SHARP PRACTICE IN MILITARY PARLANCE IT MIGHT BE REGARDED AS EXCELLENT STRATEGY
STEPHEN WAS NOT SATISFIED TO SERVE EITHER OLD OR YOUNG MASTERS ANY LONGER AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
HOWEVER IF IT WAS UTTERED BY A COLORED MAN I REGRET IT AS THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CAUSE FOR SUCH LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY AS THE SYMPATHIES OF THE SPECTATORS AND CITIZENS SEEMED TO JUSTIFY THE COURSE PURSUED

HE COULD READ AND WRITE REMARKABLY WELL FOR A SLAVE AND WELL DID HE UNDERSTAND HIS ADVANTAGES IN THIS PARTICULAR
THEIR STRUGGLES AND EXERTIONS HAVING BEEN ATTENDED WITH MORE OF THE ROMANTIC AND TRAGICAL ELEMENTS THAN HAD CHARACTERIZED THE UNDERTAKINGS OF ANY OF THE OTHER LATE PASSENGERS THE COMMITTEE FELT INCLINED TO MAKE A FULLER NOTICE OF THEM ON THE BOOK YET FAILED TO DO THEM JUSTICE IN THIS RESPECT
HE STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN OWNED BY A BLACKSMITH A VERY HARD MAN BY THE NAME OF THOMAS CARPER ISAAC WAS DISGUSTED WITH HIS MASTER'S IGNORANCE AND CRITICISED HIM IN HIS CRUDE WAY TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT
SHOULD WE NOT THEREFORE ENDEAVOR TO LET ITS HISTORY GLADDEN THE EARTH
STILL I WANT FOR YOU TO SEND ME YOUR OPINION RESPECTING MY CIRCUMSTANCES
IF ADAM HAD KNOWN NOTHING ELSE AGAINST PHILLIPS THIS WAS ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE TO HAVE AWAKENED HIS DEADLY HATE
AFTER MANY YEARS OF HARD TOILING FOR THE SUPPORT OF OTHERS THE YOKE PRESSED SO HEAVILY UPON ELIJAH'S SHOULDERS THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE SLAVE LIFE ANY LONGER
TURNER AND THE REMAINING TWO BY C.T
HORSEY WAS THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN FROM WHOM IT WAS SAID THAT HE OBTAINED THE FAVOR
I DON'T DOUBT BUT THAT THEY WOULD HONESTLY REPAY A SMALL LOAN AS SOON AS THEY COULD EARN IT

IT WAS LONG AGO SUGGESTED BY A SAGACIOUS FRIEND THAT THE POWDER BOY MIGHT FIND A BETTER PORT IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY OR IN THE PATUXENT RIVER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THIS VICINITY THAN BY ENTERING THE POTOMAC RIVER EVEN WERE THERE NO SUCH LAW
I DON'T FEEL MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM--DON'T BELIEVE HE IS THE ONE THEE ALLUDED TO
HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HARD TO SEE THEM IN WANT AND ABUSED WHEN HE WAS NOT AT LIBERTY TO AID OR PROTECT THEM
SO IN ORDER TO AVOID FURTHER TROUBLE HE APPLIED HIS ENTIRE SKILL TO THE GRAND IDEA OF MAKING HIS WAY TO CANADA
BEFORE DAY MONDAY MORNING HE CALLED ME UP TO WHIP ME
SO FIRM SO DETERMINED WAS HE THAT THE CRUELLEST RUFFIAN FELT THAT HE MUST YIELD OR CONFRONT THE LAW
THEY KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW THEM
THE RECORD IS SILENT AS TO HOW SHE WAS TREATED
I MUST GO BACK BY GOOD RIGHTS TO THE BEGINNING AND TELL ALL
JOHNSON PERRY 64
IT WAS SOMEWHERE NEAR 1824 JUST BEFORE LAFAYETTE CAME ABOUT
NO WEATHER WAS TOO COLD FOR TRAVEL NOR WAY TOO ROUGH WHEN THE SLAVE WAS MADE TO FEEL BY HIS HEARTLESS MASTER THAT HE WAS GOING TO SELL HIM OR STARVE HIM TO DEATH
AT FIRST IN LYNN WHERE HE WAS SET AT SHOEMAKING AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN
HER CHILDREN SCREAMED LAMENTABLY AND HER ELDEST DAUGHTER CRIED THEY'VE GOT MY MOTHER
THIS FACT HE HAD WELL CONSIDERED AS HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN
RETURNING TO PHILADELPHIA AFTER MANY MONTHS OF HARD LABOR IN THE SOUTH MRS HARPER INSTEAD OF SEEKING NEEDED REST AND RECREATION SCARCELY ALLOWS A DAY TO PASS WITHOUT SEEKING TO AID IN THE REFORMATION OF THE OUTCAST AND DEGRADED

JIM STATED THAT HE WAS ONCE SOLD AND FLOGGED UNMERCIFULLY SIMPLY FOR CALLING HIS MASTER MR INSTEAD OF MASTER AND HE ALLEGED THAT THIS WAS THE SECRET OF HIS EYES BEING OPENED AND HIS MIND NERVED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
OF HIS EFFORTS IN THAT DIRECTION THROUGH NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OUR SPACE WILL NOT ALLOW US TO SPEAK
THEY WERE CLOSELY QUESTIONED IN THE USUAL MANNER
WHILE MEDITATING UPON FREEDOM HE CONCLUDED TO MAKE AN EFFORT WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD TO GO TO CANADA
JOHN HENRY AT THAT TIME WAS A LITTLE TURNED OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE FULL SIX FEET HIGH AND REMARKABLY WELL PROPORTIONED IN EVERY RESPECT
WE HAVE A COLORED MAN HERE BUT HE IS NOT THAT KIND OF A MAN THE SLAVEHOLDER WAITED AWHILE THE MAN NOT MAKING HIS APPEARANCE THEN SAID
CH
IN OTHER WORDS THE ASSAILANTS POSITIVELY COMMANDED THE FUGITIVES TO SHOW WHAT RIGHT THEY POSSESSED TO BE FOUND IN A CONDITION APPARENTLY SO UNWARRANTED
THAT ALL HANDS WOULD BE BETRAYED
HE THOUGHT VERY WELL OF NATHAN HARRIS A FELLOW-SERVANT BELONGING TO THE SAME OWNER AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND IF NATHAN WOULD JOIN HIM NEITHER THE LENGTH OF THE JOURNEY THE LONELINESS OF NIGHT TRAVEL THE COLDNESS OF THE WEATHER THE FEAR OF THE SLAVE-HUNTER NOR THE SCANTINESS OF THEIR MEANS SHOULD DETER HIM FROM MAKING HIS WAY TO FREEDOM
I SEARCHED THE SCRIPTURES DAILY FINDING A CONSTRUCTION OF THE TEXT WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH WAS PRESSED UPON OUR ACCEPTANCE

NAT WAS THE NEXT
TIME WILL NOT ADMIT OF FURTHER DETAILS KINDRED TO THIS NARRATIVE
THE SLAVE FLEETING FROM HIS MASTER EVER FOUND A HOME WITH HIM AND FELT WHILE THERE THAT NO SLAVE-HUNTER WOULD GET HIM AWAY UNTIL EVERY MEANS OF PROTECTION SHOULD FAIL
THE ABOVE-NAMED PASSENGERS DID NOT ALL COME FROM THE SAME PLACE OR EXACTLY AT THE SAME TIME
I HAVE SEEN THE ALLEGED FUGITIVE BEFORE THIS
IN ORDER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF MOLESTED ON THE ROAD THE BOYS HAD PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH PISTOLS AND DIRKS AND DECLARED THAT THEY WERE FULLY BENT ON USING THEM RATHER THAN BE CARRIED BACK TO SLAVERY
WHILE REBECCA REGARDED HIM AS A MAN WITH A VERY EVIL DISPOSITION SHE NEVERTHELESS BELIEVED THAT HE HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THE PRESENT GENERATION OF SLAVES WOULD NOT BEAR SO MUCH AS SLAVES HAD BEEN MADE TO BEAR THE GENERATION PAST ARRIVAL FROM HONEY BROOK TOWNSHIP 1858

HOW MRS HILLIARD OBTAINED THE INFORMATION THE IMPRESSION IT MADE ON ELLEN AND WHERE SHE WAS SECRETED THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT OF A LETTER WRITTEN BY MRS HILLIARD TOUCHING THE MEMORABLE EVENT WILL BE FOUND DEEPLY INTERESTING

MOLOCK FRANCIS ALIAS THOS
ABOUT THE YEAR 1808 ON GOING TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS WHO HAD REMOVED TO ADAMS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HANNAH WIERMAN WHOM HE MARRIED ON THE FOURTH DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH 1815
WHEN OUR READERS REMEMBER THE HIGH WINDS OF FRIDAY AND THE SUDDEN CHANGE TO COLD DURING THAT NIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THE FUGITIVE HAD REMAINED IN THAT SITUATION FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WE THINK IT WILL BE CONCEDED THAT HE FULLY EARNED HIS LIBERTY AND THAT THE INSTITUTION WHICH WAS SO INTOLERABLE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO RUN THE RISK OF ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH TO ESCAPE FROM IT HAD NO VERY GREAT ATTRACTIONS FOR HIM
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING PECULIAR IN THE CAUSE WHICH A MAN HAS SERVED IN THE SERVICE WHICH HE HAS RENDERED AND IN OUR OWN RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WHOM HE REPRESENTS TO JUSTIFY OR TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A RECEPTION
PENDING SAID SUIT THE VESSEL OF SAID CAPTAIN OR OWNER SHALL NOT LEAVE THE STATE UNTIL BOND BE GIVEN BY THE CAPTAIN OR OWNER OR OTHER PERSON FOR HIM PAYABLE TO THE GOVERNOR WITH TWO OR THREE SURETIES SATISFACTORY TO THE COURT IN THE PENALTY OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE FORFEIT OR FINE TOGETHER WITH THE COST AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN ENFORCING THE SAME

THEY MUST UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE HAD WHITE MEN IN THE SECRET
I LIVED THERE THREE YEARS BEFORE THAT TIME AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PLACE FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS BEFORE 1830
I MUST SAY A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF
IN THE TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WILLIAM FOUND HIMSELF DARK AS EVERYTHING LOOKED HE COULD NOT CONSENT TO RETURN TO HIS MASTER AS HE FELT PERSUADED THAT IF HE DID THERE WOULD BE NO REST ON EARTH FOR HIM

THE LATE DESTRUCTIVE FIRE WE HAD I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE KEPT BRANTFORD BACK THIS SUMMER BUT IT IS INCREASING SLOWLY I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY AT THIS TIME
ELMIRA MAY 28TH
I AM NOW GOING TO HAVE A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE WOMEN OF THIS PLACE IF THEY WILL COME OUT
AND HERE WERE SOULS AS UNCONSCIOUSLY BENEFICENT AS THE ONE AS SPONTANEOUS IN GROWTH AND SHAPING AS THE OTHER
IN HIS REVIEW ALLUSION WAS MADE NOT ONLY TO HIS MASTER BUT ALSO TO HIS MISTRESS IN WHICH HE SAID THAT SHE WAS A QUARRELSOME AND CRABBED WOMAN MIDDLING STOUT IN ORDER TO SHOW A REASON WHY HE LEFT AS HE DID HE STATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A FUSS TWO OR THREE TIMES PREVIOUS TO THE ESCAPE AND IT HAD BEEN RUMORED THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD SOON THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
YOU SHALL NOT BRING THAT FOUL THING HERE
HE WAS A CARPENTER BY TRADE WHAT KIND OF A LOOKING MAN WAS HE AGAIN INQUIRED THE COMMITTEE
THEY DESCRIBED HER THUS
WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO AS OTHER PEOPLE AND I HOPE THIS MOMENT AMONG THE SLAVES ARE THE BEGINNING
AND THE OTHER ONE I RATHER THINK IS LESS FINISHED THAN THAT
HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF HIRING HIS TIME OF HIS MISTRESS FOR WHICH HE PAID TEN DOLLARS PER MONTH
JUDGE OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AT FINDING THEY WERE BEYOND HIS CONTROL--ABSOLUTELY GONE
WITHOUT UTTERING A WHISPER THAT FRIGHTFUL MOMENT THIS OFFICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED
JAMES WAS LEARNING THE CARPENTER TRADE
BROWN JAMES 502
EMILY THOMPSON S23-TU TH&ST CAPITOL HILL WASHINGTON D.C
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE'S FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF EITHER OF THESE MEMORABLE PERSONAGES WAS BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THE CLASS MOST ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN FREEDOM COULD GENERALLY MANAGE TO ACQUIRE SOME MEANS WHICH THEY WOULD WILLINGLY OFFER TO CAPTAINS OR CONDUCTORS IN THE SOUTH FOR SUCH ASSISTANCE AS WAS INDISPENSABLE TO THEIR ESCAPE
IT WAS THROUGH THE MARRIAGE OF NAT'S MISTRESS TO HIS PRESENT OWNER THAT HE CAME INTO MUIR'S HANDS
WE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER OR NOT THE FRUITLESS CHASE ON WHICH WE HAD BEEN SENT IN SEARCH OF THE ALDERMAN WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT THAT HAD LOCKED THE MEN UP DESIGNED TO MISLEAD US
I WILL GIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS EACH IF TAKEN IN THE STATE AND RETURNED TO ME OR SECURED IN SOME JAIL SO THAT I CAN GET THEM AGAIN OR A $1,000 FOR THE TWO OR $500 EACH IF TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE AND SECURED IN SOME JAIL IN THIS STATE SO THAT I CAN GET THEM AGAIN
HIS MASTER AND FATHER ENDEAVORED TO HOLD THE REINS VERY TIGHTLY UPON HIM
BUT THE MASTER HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF ISAAC HE COULD SELL HIM
MORE THAN THREE DAYS
SAINT CATHARINES
THAT WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR NOT REGISTERING ETC
IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS QUITE ACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL AS AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT AND RENDERED IMPORTANT AID IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS
WITH WHOM SHE NODDED HER HEAD TOWARD THE ILL-FAVORED MAN SIGNIFYING WITH HIM
SOME OF THIS OLD REBEL ELEMENT I THINK ARE IN FAVOR OF TAKING AWAY THE COLORED MAN'S VOTE AND IF HE LOSES IT NOW IT MAY BE GENERATIONS BEFORE HE GETS IT AGAIN
THE LEGACY DEVISED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES WAS APPLIED IN DUE TIME AFTER ONE OF THE EXECUTORS IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE DR J
ALTHOUGH SLAVE-HOLDERS HAD SPARED NO PAINS TO KEEP ABRAM IN THE DARK AND TO MAKE HIM LOVE HIS YOKE HE PROVED BY HIS ACTIONS THAT HE HAD NO FAITH IN THEIR DOCTRINES
HE KNEW THAT MANY GOT OFF BUT HOW THEY MANAGED IT HE WAS IGNORANT
FOR THE OPPRESSION OF THE POOR FOR THE SIGHING OF THE NEEDY NOW WILL I ARISE SAITH THE LORD
SIX OF HIS BROTHERS HAD BEEN SOLD
THAT BEING ESTABLISHED IT IS THE OFFICE OF THE JUDGE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PRIMA FACIE CASE INDICATES THE IDENTITY OF THE PARTY CHARGED WITH THE PARTY BEFORE HIM
CORNELIUS TOOK PASSAGE PER THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN MARCH 1857 FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SALVINGTON STAFFORD COUNTY VA
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK SHADE ORDINARY BUILD AND FULL OF GRIT
WOULD DRINK AND SWEAR--AND EVEN HIS WIFE WITH ALL HANDS WOULD HAVE TO RUN WHEN HE WAS RAISED OF HIS YOUNG MASTER HE SAID
CONSEQUENTLY THEY READILY ENDORSED HIS COURSE WHILE THEY DEEPLY SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS POOR WIFE AND LITTLE ONES
GIVE MY BEST RESPECTS TO ALL INQUIRING FRIENDS AND BELIEVE ME TO BE YOURS FOREVER
SCARCELY ANY OTHER SUBJECT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE STREETS OR IN THE SOCIAL CIRCLE
SOMETIMES I SPEAK TWICE A DAY
CHARLES HALL AND OTHERS
AFTER RECRUITING AND ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIS COMFORT AND PASSAGE TO CANADA HE WAS DULY FORWARDED
GOOD ADVICE WAS PROFFERED THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF TEMPERANCE INDUSTRY EDUCATION ETC
MRS GREEGSBY AND MRS GRAHAM HAVE BEEN RATHER AILING BUT WE HOPE THEY WILL VERY SOON BE WELL
JUNE 21 1857
AS HE HAD BEEN WORKED HARD ON POOR FARE HE CONCLUDED TO LEAVE IN COMPANY WITH HIS BROTHER AND TWO COUSINS LEAVING HIS PARENTS IN SLAVERY OWNED BY THE WIDOW PYLE WHO WAS ALSO THE OWNER OF HIMSELF
THEY VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN DEVISING MEANS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS OBJECT

HIS OWN SLAVES SPOKEN OF AS HAVING BEEN GAMBLED AWAY CAME BY HIS FATHER--HE HAS BEEN MARRIED THE SECOND TIME TWICE WILLIAM HAD BEEN SOLD AND BOUGHT IN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MASTER'S CREDITORS AND FOR MANY MONTHS HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO BE SOLD AGAIN TO MEET PRESSING CLAIMS IN THE HANDS OF THE SHERIFF AGAINST TYLER
I CEASED TO BE HIS OVERSEER IN 1841 I THINK
MR STEVENS LOVE OF HUMANITY AND IMPARTIAL FREEDOM EVEN IN THOSE DARK DAYS OF SLAVERY WHEN IT WAS BOTH UNPOPULAR AND UNSAFE TO ALLOW THE CRIES OF THE BONDMAN TO AWAKEN THE FEELING OF HUMANITY TO ASSIST THE SUFFERING WAS CONSTANTLY LEADING HIM TO TAKE SIDES WITH THE OPPRESSED AND AS HE APPEARS IN THIS CORRESPONDENCE SO IT WAS HIS WONT DAILY TO AID THE HELPLESS WHO WERE ALL AROUND HIM
HE WAS MUCH DISSATISFIED WITH SLAVERY AND FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN BADLY DEALT WITH AND THAT HE COULD DO BETTER FOR HIMSELF IN CANADA
SPERRYMAN GEO ALIAS THOS
NOT ONLY WAS SAMUEL DENIED THIS PRIVILEGE BUT HE WAS EQUALLY DENIED ALL PRIVILEGES
WHILE IN TALADEGA I WAS ENTERTAINED AND WELL ENTERTAINED AT THE HOUSE OF ONE OF OUR NEW CITIZENS
YOU SEE BY THE PAPERS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING IN OUR GREEN MOUNTAIN STATE
SUCH ANNOUNCEMENTS NEVER FRIGHTENED THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD COMMITTEE
WITH SOME OTHERS MRS HARPER CALLED AT GENERAL SICKLES HEAD QUARTERS HOPING TO ELICIT HIS SYMPATHIES WHEREBY THE POOR FELLOW'S LIFE MIGHT BE SAVED
TUBMAN HARRIET 247
O.O
SELF-TRUTH IS THE POINT,--THE FACT FOR STARTING THE LINE FOR GUIDING
ONE IS AN ENGINEER AND HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN SAWING LUMBER A SECOND A GOOD HOUSE-CARPENTER A THIRD A BLACKSMITH AND THE FOURTH A FARM HAND
IN GREAT HASTE YOURS WITH GREAT RESPECT JOS
EVERY STEP OF THEIR CRITICAL JOURNEY WAS REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON WITH MATCHLESS NATURAL ELOQUENCE,--HOW WHEN ALMOST ON THE EVE OF SUFFOCATING IN THEIR WARM BERTHS IN ORDER TO CATCH A BREATH OF AIR THEY WERE COMPELLED TO CRAWL ONE AT A TIME TO A SMALL APERTURE
HE ESCAPED IN MARCH 1857
A GOOD FROCK WITH CAPE
IN 1809 LUCRETIA JOINED HER FAMILY IN PHILADELPHIA WHITHER THEY HAD REMOVED
THIS GENTLEMAN IS HIMSELF THE SON OF A SLAVE-HOLDER BUT GAVE UP HIS EARTHLY PATRIMONY MANY YEARS SINCE FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE AND HAS SINCE MADE IT THE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO PROCLAIM THE GOSPEL IN ITS PURITY AND TO USE EVERY AVAILABLE MEANS FOR DIRECTING ALL TO CHRIST

SOON AFTER MCCREARY WITH TWO OR THREE OTHERS OF LIKE PROCLIVITIES CALLED AT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH C
WE EXPECT 3 MORE NEXT 7TH DAY NIGHT BUT HOW WE SHALL DISPOSE OF THEM WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED
THOS 481
I DO NOT URGE BUT SIMPLY SUGGEST
WE THEREFORE TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN COMMEMORATING THE GOOD DEEDS OF THE SOCIETY BY COPYING THE FOLLOWING LETTERS FROM ITS PRESIDENT MRS DR BROOKS
THEREUPON THE COURT SHALL CAUSE A RECORD TO BE MADE OF THE MATTERS SO PROVED AND ALSO A PERSONAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON SO ESCAPING WITH SUCH CONVENIENT CERTAINTY AS MAY BE
WHEN THE DAY ARRIVED FOR COMMITTING HIS REMAINS TO THE GRAVE THE EVIDENCE OF DEEP AND PERVADING SORROW AMONG THESE WRONGED AND OUTRAGED PEOPLE WAS STRIKINGLY APPARENT
BLACK BUSHY HAIR AND WELL DRESSED
SHE HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF ESCAPE HOWEVER AND THEREFORE SOUGHT A SAFE HIDING-PLACE UNTIL AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT OFFER BY WHICH SHE COULD FOLLOW HER BROTHERS ON THE U.G.R.R
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY YEARS HIS HISTORY ABOUNDS IN SIMILAR INCIDENTS AND THAT HE UNIFORMLY STOOD FORTH AS THE UNFLINCHING ADVOCATE OF THE OPPRESSED REGARDLESS OF THE SACRIFICES WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE ON THEIR BEHALF WE ARE DISPOSED TO VIEW HIM AS ONE OF THAT NOBLE BAND WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED TO DEEDS OF CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE AND WHOSE NAMES WILL ILLUMINE THE MORAL FIRMAMENT SO LONG AS VIRTUE AND TRUTH SHALL COMMAND THE HOMAGE OF MANKIND
INDIVIDUALS AND HIGHLY RESPECTABLE COMMITTEES OF GENTLEMEN HAVE REPEATEDLY WAITED UPON THESE GEORGIA MISCREANTS TO PERSUADE THEM TO MAKE A SPEEDY DEPARTURE FROM THE CITY

JOHNS ROBT AND WIFE SUEANN 486
A FREE COLORED WOMAN WHO WASHED FOR THE FAMILY WAS SUSPECTED OF KNOWING SOMETHING OF HER GOING BUT THEY FAILING TO GET AUGHT OUT OF HER SHE WAS DISCHARGED

IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES OFFICERS WERE OUTWITTED IN THIS WAY
VALUING HIS PRIZE HIGHLY HE IMPROVED MORE AND MORE UNTIL HE COULD WRITE HIS OWN PASSES SATISFACTORILY
MURRY ORACY ALIAS SOPHIA SIMS 136
HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD BEEN USED BADLY--HAD BEEN WORKED HARD AND HAD BEEN FED AND CLOTHED BUT POORLY
HE HAS BEEN SUFFERING FOR SEVERAL YEARS FROM A DISEASE OF THE BLADDER WHICH FREQUENTLY CAUSED HIM MOST ACUTE ANGUISH AND SEVERAL TIMES THREATENED HIS LIFE
BAZIL WAS HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR BY THORNTON POOL A STORE-KEEPER AND ALSO FARMER AND AT THE SAME TIME AN ARDENT LOVER OF THE CRETUR SO MUCH SO THAT HE KEPT ABOUT HALF-DRUNK ALL THE TIME SO BAZIL AFFIRMED
OF HER MASTER SHE DECLARED THAT SHE COULD SAY NOTHING GOOD HIS NAME WAS ARTHUR COOPER OF GEORGETOWN
ARRIVING AT REISTERSTOWN A VILLAGE ON THE WESTMINSTER TURNPIKE ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE MILES FROM BALTIMORE AND THIRTY-FIVE MILES FROM MR WRIGHT'S HOUSE HE WAS ARRESTED AND PLACED IN THE BAR-ROOM OF THE COUNTRY TAVERN IN CARE OF THE LANDLADY TO WAIT UNTIL HIS CAPTORS HAVING FINISHED SOME WORK IN WHICH THEY WERE ENGAGED COULD TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS MASTER
ON ARRIVING IN CANADA SAMUEL WROTE BACK FOR HIS WIFE C AS FOLLOWS
THIS PAINFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS ONLY INCREASED HIS DESIRE TO LEAVE THOSE WHO WERE BRUTAL ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCH HAVOC IN HIS DOMESTIC RELATIONS
THE BOOKS I NEED MOST AT PRESENT IS SUCH AS TREAT ON MIDWIFERY ANATOMY C
FLINT'S ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY COMBINED WITH HIS FEARLESSNESS COOL BEARING AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE FROM WHAT HE HAD READ OF THE USAGES OF TRADERS AT SLAVE SALES WITHOUT QUESTION ADMIRABLY FITTED HIM TO PLAY THE PART OF A TRADER FOR THE TIME BEING
BUT HER SHRINKING SENSITIVENESS TOO KEEN TO BE QUITE HEALTHY AND AN EXTREME OF SELF-FORGETFULNESS AMOUNTING POSSIBLY TO A DEFECT IN ONE SOJOURNING AMID THIS WORLD'S DIVERSE DISPOSITIONS AND EXPERIENCES RENDERED HER ON THE WHOLE LESS BALANCED AND COMPLETE THAN HER YOUNGER SISTERS AND NOT WELL FITTED FOR ROUGH ENCOUNTER WITH LIFE'S TRIALS
THEY REPRESENTED THE BONE AND SINEW OF THE SLAVE CLASS OF ARLINGTON AND UPON INVESTIGATION THE COMMITTEE FELT ASSURED THAT THEY WOULD CARRY WITH THEM TO CANADA INDUSTRY AND DETERMINATION SUCH AS WOULD TELL WELL FOR THE RACE
DANIEL GIBBONS
DANIEL GIBBONS
HARRISON HAD NO IDEA OF HAVING TO WORK FOR HIS SUPPORT--HE THOUGHT THAT IF JOHN COULD NOT TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF WHEN HE GREW UP TO BE A MAN THERE WAS A PLACE FOR ALL SUCH IN THE POOR-HOUSE
AFTER BEING CARED FOR BY THE COMMITTEE HE WAS SENT ON TO CANADA
THERE IS NO SLAVE HERE OF THAT NAME THE MAN REPLIED
THE MAN WAS HAULING LUMBER FROM COLUMBIA
IT TELLS NOT OF A PERSUASION BUT OF A CONVICTION
WHO THEREFORE BROUGHT THE WHOLE PARTY BEFORE JUDGE BOOTH WHO DISCHARGED THEM AT ONCE AS BEING ILLEGALLY DETAINED BY THE SHERIFF
IF IT BE RISKING LIVELIHOOD BY INTRODUCING THE CAUSE OF THE SLAVE INTO EVERY LITERARY WORK AND BY MINGLING THE SCHOOL-CULTURE OF FIFTY FUTURE MOTHERS YEAR BY YEAR WITH HATRED OF THE SIN
FOUR MEN TWO WOMEN ONE BOY AND SEVEN CHILDREN
YOU CAN READILY SEE THAT IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY FOR DANIEL TO WORK ALMOST NIGHT AND DAY TO HAVE LAID UP SO LARGE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY SINCE THE FIRST OF APRIL AS THIS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
FREDERICK DOUGLASS.--IT IS KNOWN THAT OUR MUCH-VALUED FRIEND FREDERICK DOUGLASS LEFT THIS COUNTRY SUDDENLY FOR AMERICA LAST SPRING CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE DECEASE OF A MOST BELOVED LITTLE GIRL
LET ME HEAR FROM YOU
THEY CAME FROM HIS PLANTATION IN CECIL COUNTY MARYLAND WHERE THEY HAD BEEN REARED

O

I WRITE AGAIN THUS SOON BECAUSE TWO MORE BY NAME OF SMITH JOHN AND WM HAVE ARRIVED THE PRESENT WEEK AND WERE ANXIOUS TO HAVE ME INFORM YOU THAT THEY ARE SAFELY LANDED AND FREE IN THIS REFUGE LAND
A PROMINENT MAN BY THE NAME OF BAKER WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO PHILADELPHIA AND GIVEN UP BY THE COMMISSIONER AND AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY OUR CITIZENS
HIS REPORT WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF MANY OTHERS
INDEED HE KNEW THAT HIS SO-CALLED MASTER WHOSE NAME WAS DENNY WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO HEAR COMPLAINTS FROM A SLAVE
YOU HAVE MUSCLE POWER AND BRAIN POWER SHE SAID
SURELY NO FLOWERY BEDS OF EASE AWAITED THEM
BUT THE DAY THE FUGITIVE BILL PASSED EVEN THE BRAVEST ABOLITIONIST BEGAN TO FEAR THAT A FUGITIVE SLAVE WAS NO LONGER SAFE ANYWHERE UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES NORTH OR SOUTH AND THAT WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT WERE LIABLE TO BE CAPTURED AT ANY MOMENT BY GEORGIA SLAVE HUNTERS
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW ME ANY PROVISIONS HARDLY
WHEN THIS ARRIVAL MADE ITS APPEARANCE IT WAS AT FIRST SIGHT QUITE EVIDENT THAT ONE OF THE COMPANY WAS A MAN OF MORE THAN ORDINARY PARTS BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
BEFORE STARTING ONE WEEK I COULD NOT WORK
FOR SIX LONG WEEKS DID THIS GOOD ANGEL IN HUMAN FORM ATTEND UPON THIS UNFORTUNATE OBJECT

HALL CHARLES 383
IN HIS HABITS HE WAS GENERALLY TAKEN FOR A MODERATE AND FAIR MAN THOUGH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF FLOGGING THE SLAVES--FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES AFTER THEY HAD ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF MATURITY
AT THE TIME OF HIS ARRIVAL HIS NAME ONLY WAS ENROLLED ON THE BOOK
HE HAD TWO LITTLE BOYS LIVING IN BALTIMORE WHOM HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE
CATHARINE CANADA JUNE 8TH 1854

WHILE HERE PROSECUTING HIS HUNTING OPERATIONS FIERY MANAGED TO OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF THE HARRISBURG COMMITTEE TO WHOM HIS GRIEVANCES WERE MADE KNOWN BUT DERIVED LITTLE SATISFACTION
YET LUCINDA WAS NOT WITHOUT A STRONG GROUND OF COMPLAINT
WILLIAM WRIGHT AND DR LEWIS MOUNTED MEN OR WOMEN BEHIND AND TOOK CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS
ON REACHING CANADA AND TASTING THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM THE THOUGHT OF DEAR FRIENDS IN BONDAGE MUST HAVE BEEN ACUTELY PAINFUL
HE NEVER WOULD DIRECTLY OR OTHERWISE ENTICE A SLAVE TO LEAVE HIS MASTER
ALTHOUGH SHE REACHED FREE LAND THE SEVERE STRUGGLE COST HER THE LOSS OF ALL HER TOES
COLOR BROWN WELL-FORMED SELF-POSSESSED AND INTELLIGENT
IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT LIGHT FREIGHT WOULD BE OFFERED TO CAPTAIN B BUT THE OWNERS CANNOT BY POSSIBILITY ADVANCE THE AMOUNT OF FREIGHT

LIKE OTHER RACES THIS NEWLY EMANCIPATED PEOPLE WILL NEED ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PAST CONDITION WHICH THEY CAN GET
MARY WAS OWNED BY CHRISTIAN THOMAS
HARRIET TUBMAN BEING WELL ACQUAINTED IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND KNOWING OF THEIR SITUATION AND HAVING CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD PROVE TRUE AS PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD ENGAGED TO PILOT THEM WITHIN REACH OF WILMINGTON AT LEAST TO THOMAS GARRETT'S
HE WAS NEVERTHELESS WIDE-AWAKE AND FULL OF COURAGE
HE TESTIFIED THAT ILL-TREATMENT FROM HIS MASTER HENRY MARTIN WHO WOULD GIVE HIM NO CHANCE AT ALL WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS LEAVING
HE THEN GAVE ME THREE HUNDRED LASHES WELL LAID ON
THE SHEEP THEN THAT CHRIST COMMANDS US AS WE LOVE HIM TO FEED ARE THOSE WHO ARE FAMISHING FOR THE LACK OF THE FOOD WHICH IT IS IN OUR POWER TO SUPPLY
PURNELL SAID HE BURNT THE LETTER
BUT JOSEPH DID NOT ALLOW A WEEK TO PASS OVER HIM BEFORE HE WAS READY TO MAKE EVEN A STILL MORE DARING ADVENTURE FOR HIS LIBERTY
OH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SAD IF AFTER ALL THE DESOLATION AND CARNAGE THAT HAVE DYED OUR PLAINS WITH BLOOD AND CRIMSONED OUR BORDERS WITH WARFARE THE PALE YOUNG CORPSES TRODDEN DOWN BY THE HOOFS OF WAR THE DIM EYES THAT HAVE LOOKED THEIR LAST UPON THE LOVED AND LOST HAD THE ARM OF EXECUTIVE POWER FAILED US IN THE NATION'S FEARFUL CRISIS

7TH 1859
IN HIS HOUR OF TRIAL HIS WIFE PHILLIS AND CHILD JOHN WESLEY WHO WERE FREE CAUSED HIM MUCH ANXIETY
MANY OF OUR READERS WILL NO DOUBT REMEMBER MRS MOTT AT ANTI-SLAVERY MEETINGS HER MIND INTENTLY FIXED UPON THE PROCEEDINGS WHILE HER HANDS WERE AS BUSILY ENGAGED IN USEFUL SEWING OR KNITTING
HE WAS A CROSS RUGGED MAN ALLOWING NOT HALF ENOUGH TO EAT AND WORKED HIS SLAVES LATE AND EARLY
HE GENERALLY SPOKE EXTEMPORANEOUSLY ON THE SPUR OF THE OCCASION AND WHAT HE SAID CAME WARM FROM THE HEART
LEWIS LAURA 288
THE HON
WILMINGTON 11TH MO 4TH 1856
HE THOUGHT HE COULD DO THE SAME
THE VOLUME IS QUITE LARGE AND COMMANDING IN APPEARANCE
THERE WAS NO FORM OF HUMAN SUFFERING THAT DID NOT TOUCH HIS HEART
I MADE A PERSONAL PLEDGE TO GLOUCESTER IN OUR ROOM LAST WEEK AT CONGRESS HALL
THE UPRISING OF THE NORTH
INDEED IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT HIS RESOLUTE COURSE WAS BRINGING FLOODS OF SYMPATHY FROM THE ABLEST AND BEST MINDS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH
BUT HIS REASON TAUGHT HIM THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO THROW OFF THE YOKE AT ALL HAZARDS AND HE ACTED ACCORDINGLY
ITS PUBLICATION HAS ONLY BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SELDOM ATTEND THE BIRTH OF A BOOK
THE KIDNAPPER IS FULLY SHOWN IN THE CASE OF RACHEL AND ELIZABETH PARKER AS HE APPEARED ON THE SOIL OF PENNSYLVANIA DOING HIS VILE WORK IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT ENTERING THE HOMES OF UNPROTECTED FEMALES AND CHILDREN THEREFORE
THOUSANDS WHOSE SERIOUS DEPORTMENT AND DEJECTED COUNTENANCES EVINCED THAT THEY WERE FULLY SENSIBLE OF THEIR LOSS COLLECTED IN THE VICINITY OF HIS DWELLING ANXIOUS TO TESTIFY THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS MEMORY
WELLS R.J
SHE WAS THE OWNER OF FIVE OTHER SLAVES
THIS WAS AS A BOMB-SHELL TO MR HOBSON AND HE IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE HINT AND WITH HIS TRUNKS STEERED FOR THE SUNNY SOUTH
THE MAN WE'RE AFTER IS A MISERABLE WORTHLESS THIEVING SCOUNDREL OH
I WAS HOME WHEN AUNT HAD HER AMBRO-TYPE TAKEN FOR YOU
MARY CONFESSED THAT SHE HAD BEEN HELD TO SERVICE AS THE PROPERTY OF MRS HENRY HARDING WHO RESIDED AT ROCKVILLE SOME MILES OUT OF WASHINGTON
SOME FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE MISTRESS CHILDREN AND SOME INTO THE HANDS OF THE GRANDCHILDREN
C.W
HE IS SO ANXIOUS TO GET HIS FAMILY FROM SLAVERY THAT HE IS WILLING TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO GET THEM TO CANADA
HE WAS AN ABOLITIONIST FROM HIS YOUTH UP AND THOUGH THE GRAND OLD CAUSE NUMBERED AMONGST ITS SUPPORTERS POETS SAGES AND STATESMEN IT HAD NO MORE FAITHFUL WORKER IN ITS RANKS THAN THOMAS GARRETT
PLYMOUTH WAS FORTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF A LIGHT CHESTNUT COLOR WITH KEEN EYES AND A GOOD COUNTENANCE AND WITHAL POSSESSED OF SHREWDNESS ENOUGH TO LEAD DOUBLE THE NUMBER THAT ACCOMPANIED HIM
THE CASE OF THE STATE AGAINST SAM GREEN FREE NEGRO INDICTED FOR HAVING IN HIS POSSESSION PAPERS PAMPHLETS AND PICTORIAL REPRESENTATIONS HAVING A TENDENCY TO CREATE DISCONTENT ETC AMONG THE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE STATE WAS TRIED BEFORE THE COURT ON FRIDAY LAST
I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE MISSED MORE THAN ONE SUNDAY THAT I HAVE NOT ADDRESSED SOME SUNDAY-SCHOOL AND I HAVE NOT MISSED MANY DAY-SCHOOLS EITHER
BUT HAD NEVER PRACTICED SHOWING FAVORS OR ALLOWING PRIVILEGES OF ANY KIND
HE WENT TO THE PUMP AND FILLED THEM WITH WATER THUS HE WAS ABLE TO GET THEM OFF IN A FEW MINUTES
DOES THE COUNSEL MEAN TO SAY THAT IN THE CASE OF A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE HE IS NOT BOUND TO SATISFY THE JUDGE BEFORE WHOM THE QUESTION IS HEARD
BESIDES THIS THERE MUST BE SOME ACT OF VIOLENCE AS THE RESULT OR CONSEQUENCE OF THE COMBINING
WHILE HE WAS GONE A SLAVE-HOLDER CAME TO THE HOUSE AND INQUIRED FOR HIS SLAVE
TRUSTY AND TO ALEXANDER I HAVE BEEN A MAN AGGE BUT WAS ASSURD NUTHIN H
IT IS PRE-EMINENTLY THE BOOK FOR THE COLORED RACE
HE HAD HOWEVER NOT BEEN LIVING UNDER HIS IMMEDIATE PATRIARCHAL GOVERNMENT BUT HAD BEEN HIRED OUT TO A FARMER BY THE NAME OF JAMES DODSON WITH WHOM HE EXPERIENCED LIFE SOMETIMES HARD AND SOMETIMES SMOOTH TO USE HIS OWN WORDS
MRS MOTT SAYS IN REFERENCE TO THIS EMPLOYMENT
SHE WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN UP AS LOST WAS NOW FOUND
JOE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE FULL BLACK SLENDER AND OF AVERAGE INTELLECT CONSIDERING THE CLASS WHICH HE REPRESENTED
I THOUGHT AT THIS RATE THERE WAS NO USE OF HOLDING ON ANY LONGER FOR THE GOOD TIME TO COME SO HERE I SAID I AM GOING IF I DIE A TRYING
THE STYLE IS PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND UNAFFECTED AND IT IS WELL THAT IT IS SO
DURING THE LAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE WAS AN ELDER IN THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS OF WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN EARNEST CONSISTENT AND DEVOTED MEMBER
HAD NO CONTROL PREVENTED HIS COMING SO I HAVE COME MADAM TO LOOK AFTER YOUR BUSINESS IN HIS PLACE
IT CURSED HIM WHO SERVED AND IT CURSED HIM THAT OWNED THE SLAVE
I DIDN'T LIKE MR TYLER MUCH WAS THE REPLY
IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT OWING TO CIRCUMSTANCES THE ACCOUNT OF THESE PERSONS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY PRESERVED
I CONSIDER MOST OF THE TROUBLE OVER TILL I ARRIVE IN A FREE STATE WITH MY CREW THE FIRST WEEK IN MARCH
THEY SAID THEY WOULD PAY MY EXPENSES IF I DIDN'T SUCCEED IN GETTING MINE OUT OF PRISON IN THIS WAY THE ABOVE WITNESS COMPLETELY DARKENED COUNSEL AND ADDED TO THE WEAKNESS OF HIS CAUSE IN A MARKED DEGREE
ROBERT MCCOY ALIAS WILLIAM DONAR
EDWARDS ALFRED 511
I WISH SHE WAS HERE NOW
VIJOL U.S
THANKS BE TO GOD
HE HAD NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THE MAN WHO HELD HIM IN BONDAGE JACOB JOHNSON BUT NO OTHER CHARGES OF ILL TREATMENT C HAVE BEEN FOUND AGAINST SAID JOHNSON ON THE BOOKS SAVE THOSE ALLUDED TO ABOVE
WHILE BOB CONSIDERED HE MADE A VERY GOOD GRAB HE DID NOT ADMIT THAT THE AMOUNT ADVERTISED WAS CORRECT
THE AUTHORITIES HOWEVER HAD UTTERLY FAILED TO CATCH THE HERO WILLIAM PARKER AS HE HAD BEEN SENT TO CANADA VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND WAS THUS SITTING UNDER HIS OWN VINE AND FIG TREE WHERE NONE DARED TO MOLEST OR MAKE HIM AFRAID AS AN ACT OF SIMPLE JUSTICE IT MAY HERE BE STATED THAT THE ABOLITIONISTS AND PRISONERS FOUND A TRUE FRIEND AND ALLY AT LEAST IN ONE UNITED STATES OFFICIAL WHO BY THE WAY FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN MAKING ARRESTS ETC NAMELY
KNOWING THAT THE OLD MAN COULD NOT STAND IT MUCH LONGER WILLIAM SAW THAT IT WAS HIS POLICY TO GET AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD
HE DID NOT FIND MUCH FAULT WITH HER
HERE IS A WONDERFUL EXHIBITION OF AFFECTION FOR HIS CONTENTED AND HAPPY NEGROES
FIDGETING ON HIS SEAT HE SAID SOMETHING EXACTLY WHAT I DO NOT NOW RECOLLECT
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND OF COURSE HIS REASON FOR WANTING THE LETTER WROTE AND POSTED AT PHILADELPHIA
WHY WHAT IS DEATH BUT LIFE IN OTHER FORMS OF BEING
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LIMITED SPACE OCCUPIED IN NOTING THEM ON THE RECORD BOOK THE COMMITTEE REGARDED THEM AS BEING AMONG THE MOST WORTHY AND BRAVE TRAVELERS PASSING OVER THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND FELT WELL SATISFIED THAT SUCH SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY WOULD DO CREDIT IN CANADA NOT ONLY TO THEMSELVES BUT TO THEIR RACE
HAVING CAUTIOUSNESS LARGELY DEVELOPED HE DETERMINED TO REACH CANADA AND KEEP OUT OF DANGER
SMITH JULIUS 454
SHE HAS BEEN THE STAFF OF DECREPIT AGE AND THE JOY OF MANHOOD IN ITS STRENGTH
FULLY QUALIFIED TO GIVE CLEAR STATEMENTS AS TO THE CONDITION OF SLAVERY IN RICHMOND ETC
REMEMBER ME TO MR LANDA AND MISS MILLEN JESPAN AND MUCH TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
YOU MAY WIN BACK THE COTTON STATES TO CEASE FROM THREATENING YOU WITH SECESSION AND TO PLANT THEIR FEET UPON YOUR NECKS AND SO EVADE THE TROUBLE THAT NOW MENACES US
OTHERS WE KNEW HARRIET TUBMAN AND MOSES AMONG THEM IN THEIR LATEST AND SAFEST REFUGE CANADA UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE CROSS OF ST GEORGE AND ST ANDREW
THEY ARE BUILDING UP A FUTURE WHICH IF EXCEPTIONAL NOW I HOPE WILL BECOME MORE GENERAL HEREAFTER
THE BROTHERS SUCCEEDED BUT SHE WAS LEFT
WHILE SHE WAS NEVER CAUGHT BY HER OWNERS SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF ANOTHER SLAVEHOLDER NO BETTER THAN HER OLD MASTER INDEED SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE FOUND IT EVEN WORSE UNDER HIM SO FAR AS SEVERE FLOGGINGS WERE CONCERNED
WIND AND TIDE WERE NOW WHAT THEY PRAYED FOR TO SPEED ON THE U.G.R.R
I THINK EVERY MAN HAS AS MUCH AS HE CAN DO TO ANSWER FOR HIS OWN SINS
ONLY AS DESERT CAN BE PROVED BY THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE EXHIBITION OF HIGH MORAL CHARACTER IN EXAMPLES OF ECONOMY AND A DISPOSITION TO ENCOURAGE INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES CONDUCTED BY MEN OF THEIR OWN RANKS WILL IT BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE POLITICAL PROGRESS IN THE FACE OF THE PRESENT PUBLIC SENTIMENT
SHE FEELS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT HER CHILDREN I WILL ASSURE YOU
ROBERT WAS A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE DARK MULATTO OF MORE THAN ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE

MEN WERE COMPELLED TO TAKE SIDES AND BUT ONE RESULT COULD FOLLOW THE RESULT WHICH ALWAYS FOLLOWS WHEN HUMAN NATURE IS STUNG AND QUICKENED TO FIND ITS HIGHEST INSTINCTS THE PARTY OF RIGHT STEADILY MOVED TO TRIUMPH
ONCE OR TWICE HE WAS CAPTURED AND CARRIED BACK
THE SISTER-IN-LAW HAD ABSCONDED FROM HER MISTRESS ABOUT NINE MONTHS SINCE AND WAS SECRETED IN THE ROOM OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WHO WAS COOK IN A DISTINGUISHED SLAVE-HOLDING FAMILY IN WASHINGTON
BE THIS AS IT MAY THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS ARRIVED SAFELY AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION AND WERE GLADLY RECEIVED
THEY ARRIVED HERE THIS MORNING AT 8-1/2 O'CLOCK AND LEFT TWENTY MINUTES PAST THREE
AT THAT TIME I WENT REGULARLY BUT NOT OF LATE
BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE LED TO STOP SHORT OF CANADA READILY FINDING EMPLOYMENT AND GOING TO WORK TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
ON THESE TWO POINTS HE WROTE SEVERAL TIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE FEELING
THE PRACTICE OF PUNISHING SLAVES BY PUTTING THEM IN THE STOCKS AND BY FLOGGING WAS DWELT UPON IN A MANNER THAT LEFT NO ROOM TO DOUBT BUT THAT JOE HAD BEEN A VERY GREAT SUFFERER UNDER HIS MASTER'S IRON RULE
AT THE TIME OF HIS ESCAPE HE WAS WORTH TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS PER MONTH TO HIS MASTER
JIM HAD BEEN NUMBERED WITH THE LIVE STOCK OF THE LATE HON
HE OF COURSE CAME OFF UNSCATHED
FOR HIS BOARD AND CLOTHING WILLIAM HAD BEEN ALLOWED $1.50 PER WEEK
AND I AM HERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR INVITATION LIFTING UP HIS HANDS HE EXCLAIMED WHY MY DEAR SIR I THOUGHT YOU WERE A BLACK MAN
HERE HEROISM AND PATIENCE STAND OUT TRANSFIGURED
WHILE HANSEL DID NOT REALLY OWN HIMSELF HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF HAVING A WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN
HAVING ONCE LAID HIS HAND TO THE PLOUGH HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO LOOK BACK,--NOT EVEN TO BID HIS SISTERS GOOD-BYE BUT HE ACTUALLY LEFT THEM AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED TO BE HOME TO HIS DINNER AS USUAL
WE HERE COPY FROM A LETTER DATED AT RUSHSYLVANIA OHIO DEC
THE ENERGY AND ZEAL OF OUR FRIEND IN HIS EFFORTS FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE ABOUT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR DEAREST RIGHTS SOON DISTINGUISHED HIM AS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF ITS DUTIES
I HAVE NOTHING OF INTEREST TO WRITE ABOUT JUST NOW ONLY THAT THE POLITICS OF THE DAY IS IN A HIGH RAGE AND I DON'T KNOW OF THE RESULT THEREFORE I WANT YOU TO BE ONE OF THOSE WIDE-A-WAKES AS IS MENTIONED FROM YOUR SECTION OF COUNTRY NOW-A-DAYS C
BUT I AFFIRM THAT NEVER SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN WAS THERE A GRANDER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO SPEAK TO SUFFER AND TO DIE THAN THE CAUSE OF THESE FREE STATES AS AGAINST THAT OF THE STATES NOW RUSHING UPON SECESSION
I HAD ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX DOLLARS WHEN I LEFT PHILADELPHIA ONE HUNDRED FROM YOU TWENTY-SIX MINE
HIS APPEALS HAD AT LAST REACHED THE HEART OF HIS MOTHER--SHE COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO SEE HIM STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING AND NOT RENDER HIM AID WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE
ARRIVED FROM NORFOLK ABOUT THE 1ST OF NOVEMBER 1854
HE HEARD AT LAST OF A CERTAIN CAPTAIN WHO WAS THEN DOING QUITE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN AN UNDERGROUND WAY
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD IF TAKEN OUT OF THE COUNTY AND IN ANY OF THE STATES OR FIFTY DOLLARS IF TAKEN IN THE COUNTY OR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND SECURED SO THAT I GET HIM AGAIN
IN TRAVELING HE RESOLVED THAT NOTHING SHOULD STOP HIM
PREVIOUS TO HIS BECOMING THE OWNER OF VERENEA IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE ALTHOUGH NOTHING IS RECORDED IN PROOF OF THIS INFERENCE EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO LOSE HER FIRST HUSBAND BY A SALE
THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IN ALL THE REGION OF COUNTRY WHENCE HENRY CAME EXHIBITED GENERALLY GREAT BRUTALITY AND CRUELTY
NEVERTHELESS GOD REIGNS AND WE NEED NOT DESPAIR AND I FOR ONE DO NOT
I TOLD HIM I WAS
I WAS TIED AND PUT UP STAIRS FOR SAFE KEEPING
SHE UNHESITATINGLY TOOK HER BAGGAGE AND STARTED FOR MY MARYLAND THUS ENDED ONE OF THE MOST PLEASANT INTERVIEWS THAT EVER TOOK PLACE BETWEEN A SLAVE-HUNTER AND THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA
I SENT YOU THE MORNING HERALD YESTERDAY WHICH CONTAINED A ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURD ON THE G
ONE HAS NOT A SINGLE PANE OF GLASS AND THE SAME APERTURE THAT ADMITS THE LIGHT ALSO GIVES INGRESS TO THE AIR
YES WAS THE ANSWER
HE WAS OF PROMISING APPEARANCE AND FOUND NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER ON THE ROAD
I HOPE YOUR LABORS WILL BE REWARDED BY A GRATEFUL PUBLIC
WITHIN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS HE HAD SOLD A MAN AND WOMAN
ONE THING THEY DECIDED TO DO IMMEDIATELY NAMELY TO LEAVE THE HORSE AND CARRIAGE AND TRY OTHER MODES OF TRAVEL
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE FAILURE OF HER MASTER WAS GIVEN AS THE REASON OF HER SALE
MILLER JOSEPH C 551
STOWED AWAY IN A HOT BERTH
AND HOW HIS MOTHER WAS DRAGGING HER CHAINS IN SLAVERY UP TO THE HOUR HE FLED
THIS SEEMED RATHER AN EARLY HOUR FOR VISITORS AND I COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE
MY LORD
WHILE IT WAS A GREAT GRATIFICATION TO HAVE TRAVELERS COMING ALONG SO FAST AND ESPECIALLY TO OBSERVE IN EVERY COUNTENANCE DETERMINATION RARE MANLY AND WOMANLY BEARING WITH REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE ACTING COMMITTEE FELT AT THE SAME TIME A VERY LIVELY DREAD OF THE SLAVE-HUNTERS AND WERE ON THEIR GUARD
THE IDEA OF NORTH CAROLINA AND A NEW MASTER MADE SOLOMON RATHER NERVOUS AND HE WAS THEREBY PROMPTED TO ESCAPE
THE RICHMOND PAPERS BEAR WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT BENJAMIN DAVIS ADVERTISED CHARLES GILBERT FOR MOUTHS PRIOR TO THIS DATE AS HAS BEEN STATED IN THIS NARRATIVE
IF A BETTER WAY SHALL NOT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU AND YOU SEE FIT TO GIVE ME THE FACTS IN THE CASE I CAN BETTER JUDGE OF MY ABILITY TO HELP YOU
11 NO PILOT ACTING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE LAWS OF THE STATE SHALL PILOT OUT OF THE JURISDICTION OF THIS STATE ANY SUCH VESSEL AS IS DESCRIBED IN THIS ACT WHICH HAS NOT OBTAINED AND EXHIBITED TO HIM THE CERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION HEREBY REQUIRED
THERE IS BLOOD UPON YOUR CITY DARK AND DISMAL IS THE STAIN
AFTER WORKING THE LIFE OUT OF A WOMAN IN ORDER THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HER TO BURY HE BECOMES HASTILY IN FAVOR OF FREEDOM
WILLIAM BUTCHER ALIAS WM
JOSEPH HENRY CAME FROM QUEEN ANN COUNTY MARYLAND
HERE IS ANOTHER--WHAT SHALL I CALL IT?--MEETING-PLACE
AFTER I WENT FROM LIMERICK I WENT TO SPRINGVALE
BUT INSTEAD OF SO DOING THE BOYS STRUCK AWAY AT THEM WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT WITH THEIR LARGE CLUBS NOT EVEN WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THESE SUPERIOR INDIVIDUALS WANTED
WELL SIR I WAS VERY LOTH TO LEAVE MY WIFE AND CHILD BUT I JUST THOUGHT IN THIS WAY
HE HELD DR ABRAHAM STREET RESPONSIBLE FOR TREATING HIM AS A SLAVE
I HAVE REASON TO BE THANKFUL THAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE FOR A FREE LABOR DRESS IF IT IS COARSER
RICHARDS WHO WAS POSSIBLY A NEAR RELATIVE OF HIS
HENSON KELLY WAS OWNED BY REASON HASTELL OF BALTIMORE
HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE THEREBY LEFT WITHOUT THEIR PROTECTOR AND HEAD
ABOUT A FORTNIGHT SINCE A LETTER WAS BROUGHT TO OUR OFFICE FROM A WELL-KNOWN FRIEND THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE IN SUBSTANCE AS FOLLOWS
THE PASSENGERS BY THIS ARRIVAL WERE ABOVE THE ORDINARY PLANTATION OR FARM HAND SLAVE AS WILL APPEAR FROM A GLANCE AT THEIR CONDITION UNDER THE YOKE
HIS LIFE WAS LONG AND HAPPY AND USEFUL TO HIS FELLOW-MEN
F.T
THE FIRST INDICATION OF DANGER MANIFESTED ITSELF AS THEY STOOD ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF A SMALL BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO ROW THEM TO THE SCHOONER
THIS SEVERE CRITIC COULD NOT READ BUT HE HAD VERY CLEAR VIEWS ON THE ETHICS OF HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS AGREEING WITH SCRIPTURE CONCERNING WHITED SEPULCHRES ETC
BARNABY GRIGBY ALIAS JOHN BOYER AND MARY ELIZABETH HIS WIFE
IN THE ENTRY OF THE SECOND FLOOR THEY MET ONE OF MY SISTERS WHO HEARING AN UNUSUAL NOISE HAD SPRUNG FROM HER BED
THE COMMITTEE DID NOT SEE A DOLLAR OF THEIR MONEY BUT UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD ABOUT $900 AFTER PAYING THE CAPTAIN
SLAVERY HE CONSIDERED AS DEATH TO HIM
CLEVELAND
CLEVELAND
WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO SEE DR LUNDY AND IF HE HAS MY CLOTHES IN CHARGE OR KNOWS ABOUT THEM FOR HIM TO SEND THEM ON TO ME IMMEDIATELY AS I AM IN GREAT NEED OF THEM
IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS WIFE SENT HER ON IN ADVANCE AS HE HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER SOON IN A SIMILAR MANNER
SINCE REACHING HER MAJORITY IN LOOKING BACK THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES FROM HER OWN PEN EXPRESS THE LONELINESS OF HER CHILDHOOD DAYS
IT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF AIDING SLAVES TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR MASTERS IN THE SOUTH BUT ITS OPERATIONS WERE SO MYSTERIOUS AND SECRET THAT ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY KNEW AND SPOKE VAGUELY OF ITS EXISTENCE DURING THE TIME OF SLAVERY YET NONE BUT THE INITIATED KNEW THE SECRETS OF ITS MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS
THREE BROTHERS LIKEWISE WERE EVER IN HIS THOUGHTS IN CHAINS HENRY BILL AND SAM HALF BROTHERS BUT AFTER ALL THE HOPE OF FREEDOM OUTWEIGHED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION AND HE WAS PREPARED TO GIVE UP ALL FOR LIBERTY
NOT UNFREQUENTLY SHE GAVE UTTERANCE TO SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS THE FOLLOWING
FISHER ROBT 206
SEVEN MILES ALL THE WAY UP TO MY PLACE OF DEPARTURE IS SWIFT WATER AND ROCKY
SHE HAD BEEN PRAYING ALL THE TIME WHILE WAITING BUT NOW SHE FELT THAT IF IT WOULD ONLY RAIN RIGHT HARD THE NEXT MORNING ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK TO DRIVE THE POLICE OFFICERS OFF THE STREET THEN SHE COULD SAFELY MAKE HER WAY TO THE BOAT THEREFORE SHE PRAYED ANXIOUSLY ALL THAT DAY THAT IT WOULD RAIN BUT NO SIGN OF RAIN APPEARED TILL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT THE PROSPECT LOOKED HORRIBLY DISCOURAGING
HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN SOLD SEVERAL TIMES
COOPER MARY 430
THE FACT WAS SOON MADE KNOWN THAT THE HIGH SHERIFF HAD ADMINISTERED ON THE ESTATE OF THE LATE MISTRESS
IF TO GET RID OF THE PRESENT ALARM WE CONCEDE ALL THAT MAKES IT WORTH WHILE TO LIVE--AND NOTHING LESS WILL AVAIL--PERHAPS THOSE WHO CAN DELIBERATELY MAKE SUCH A CONCESSION WILL NOT FEEL THE DEGRADATION BUT STRIPPED OF ALL HONOR AND MANHOOD THEY MAY EAT AS HEARTILY AND SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS EVER
WILLIAM THOMAS WAS A YELLOW MAN TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND POSSESSING A VIGOROUS CONSTITUTION
CAROLINE ALDRIDGE AND JOHN WOOD
THE QUERIST SOMEWHAT MYSTIFIED FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN WHEN THE TWO WERE ALONE THE LAD SAID I AM THE ONE THE DR WENT AFTER AFTER CONGRATULATING HER THE WRITER ASKED WHY SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE WAS NOT FROM WASHINGTON BUT FROM YORK
THE WHOLE SCENE EXCITED A GREAT SENSATION
HE GOT HIS GUN AND THREATENED TO SHOOT HIM OPEN YOUR MOUTH IF YOU DARE AND I WILL PAT THE WHOLE LOAD INTO YOU SAID THE ENRAGED MASTER
HOW SUDDENLY THESE SAD TIDINGS TURNED INTO MOURNING AND GLOOM THE HOPE AND JOY OF PETER AND HIS RELATIVES NO PEN COULD POSSIBLY DESCRIBE
AND IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT THERE ARE WHITE WOMEN IN CANADA TO-DAY WHO ARE MARRIED TO SOME POOR SLAVE WOMAN'S FUGITIVE HUSBAND
IF YOU GET ANY INTELLIGENCE PLEASE INFORM ME
IT WAS INTENDED NOW TO ORGANIZE A COMMITTEE WHICH SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF PERSONS OF KNOWN RESPONSIBILITY AND WHO COULD BE RELIED UPON TO ACT SYSTEMATICALLY AND PROMPTLY AND WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY IN ALL CASES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE THEIR ATTENTION
I DISCLAIM WITH ALL THE SINCERITY OF MY SOUL ANY SPECIAL PRAISE FOR ANYTHING I HAVE DONE
HIS MOTHER WAS STILL IN BONDAGE IN BALTIMORE
I SHALL KNOW IN TIME IF I CAN BE PATIENT TO WAIT
AFTERWARDS NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM UNTIL THE RECEIPT OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM PROF L.D
NEWTON ISAAC 509
PERRY'S LETTER SUBJOINED EXPLAINS WHERE HE WENT AND HOW HIS MIND WAS OCCUPIED WITH THOUGHTS OF HIS WIFE CHILDREN AND FRIENDS
THE 24 YEARS THAT I SERVED MY MASTER
HERE NO HOPE OF COMFORT FOR THE FUTURE SEEMED TO REMAIN

FOR FACTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ONLY WITHIN THE LAST WEEK TRANSCEND ALL DENUNCIATION
WHERE WILL THEY GO TO WHEN COLD WEATHER COMES

SUCH NOTORIETY AS WAS GIVEN THEM BY THE ABOVE ADVERTISEMENT DID NOT IN THE LEAST DAMAGE BILL AND HANSON IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE COMMITTEE
WILLIAM WRIGHT ILLUSTRATION
I MUST BRING MY LETTOR TO A CLOSE AS I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY AND BELIEVE ME TO BE YOUR FAITHFULL FRIEND
THIS WE MAY REGARD AS THE FORMAL CLOSING OF FIFTY YEARS OF WORK IN BEHALF OF A RACE WHICH SHE HAS SEEN RAISED FROM A POSITION OF ABJECT SERVITUDE TO ONE HIGHER THAN THAT OF A MONARCH'S THRONE
THEY WERE ONLY IGNORANT FARM HANDS
WILLIAM HUGHES WAS AN EASTERN SHORE PIECE OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO DANIEL COX

AND SO THE GRAND INQUEST UPON THEIR RESPECTIVE OATHS AND AFFIRMATIONS AFORESAID DO SAY THAT THE SAID JAMES JACKSON IN MANNER AFORESAID AS MUCH AS IN HIM LAY WICKEDLY AND TRAITOROUSLY DID PREVENT BY MEANS OF FORCE AND INTIMIDATION THE EXECUTION OF THE SAID LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE SAID STATE AND DISTRICT
HE HAS BEEN MAKING INQUIRIES ABOUT ME BUT THAT CAN MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN MY FEELINGS TO HIM
THAT HE COULD EXERCISE NO RIGHTS OR PRIVILEGES WHATEVER SAVE AS HE MIGHT OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM HIS MASTER
HANSEL DID NOT SPEAK OF HIS OWNER AS BEING A HARD MAN BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT AS GOOD AS THE BEST THAT HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH
I DO NOT THINK IN THE CASES UNDER THIS ACT OF CONGRESS OR A TREATY OR CONSTITUTIONAL OR LEGAL PROVISION FOR THE EXTRADITION OF FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF IDENTITY COULD BE ESTABLISHED BY DEPOSITIONS
HENDERSON BELONGED TO THE ESTATE OF A
MY MASTER WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLD OUT THIS FALL AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I DID NOT WANT TO BE SOLD LIKE A HORSE THE WAY THEY GENERALLY SOLD DARKIES THEN
THEY APPEARED TRAVEL-WORN GARMENTS DIRTY AND FORLORN
THE MISTRESS HAVING RELATIVES IN THIS CITY TARRIED HERE A SHORT TIME NOT DOUBTING THAT SHE HAD SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER AUNT HANNAH TO KEEP HER FROM CONTACT WITH EITHER ABOLITIONISTS OR THOSE OF HER OWN COLOR AND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN TAKING HER WITH HER TO HER JOURNEY'S END
AS THE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE IN MY IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I WAS FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES I PROPOSE TO GIVE A TRUTHFUL HISTORY OF THAT VILE AND WICKED TRANSACTION

IT MAY NOW BE SEEN THAT WHILE THIS CHILD HAD NOT BEEN A CONSCIOUS SUFFERER FROM THE WICKED SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IT HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF VERY GREAT ANXIETY AND SUFFERING TO SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD INDIVIDUALLY PERILLED THEIR OWN FREEDOM FOR ITS REDEMPTION
WHY OH

WE SEE HIM NOW WITH OUR MIND'S EYE BUT WITH THE EYE OF FLESH WE SHALL SEE HIM NO MORE
BESIDES THE CASES COMING UNDER THE NOTICE OF THE COMMITTEE WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO INTERESTING THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THEM ANYTHING LIKE JUSTICE
SHE HAD TREATED HIM CRUELLY AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HE WAS MOVED TO SEEK HIS FREEDOM

AT FIRST MISS LEWIS THOUGHT OF FORWARDING ONLY A PART OF HER FUGITIVE GUESTS TO THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA BUT ON FURTHER CONSIDERATION ALL WERE SAFELY SENT ALONG IN DUE TIME AND THE COMMITTEE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO HAVE THEM MADE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE AS THE CASES OF THESE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN ESPECIALLY CALLED FORTH THE DEEPEST SYMPATHY
AS WE WITHHOLD THESE BLESSINGS SO IS IT IN OUR POWER TO BESTOW THEM
HE CERTAINLY DISPLAYED MORE REAL DISINTERESTEDNESS MORE EARNEST UNASSUMING DEVOTEDNESS THAN THOSE WHO CLAIM TO BE THE SINCEREST FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE CAN OFTEN BOAST

THIS EPISTLE FROM THE OLD FRIEND OF THE FUGITIVE THOMAS GARRETT EXCITED UNUSUAL INTEREST

MICHAEL VAUGHN
THIS SHOWED THAT DAVIS WAS WILLING TO RISK HEAVY EXPENSES FOR CHARLES AS WELL AS GAVE EVIDENCE THAT HE BELIEVED HIM STILL SECRETED EITHER ABOUT RICHMOND PETERSBURG OR OLD POINT COMFORT
I'M IN AMERICA BUT NOT UNDER SUCH A GOVERNMENT THAT I CANNOT EXPRESS MYSELF SPEAK THINK OR WRITE SO AS I AM ABLE AND IF MY MASTER HAD ALLOWED ME TO HAVE AN EDUCATION I WOULD MAKE THEM AMERICAN SLAVE-HOLDERS FEEL ME YEAS I WOULD MAKE THEM TREMBLE WHEN I SPOKE AND WHEN I TAKE MY PEN IN HAND THEIR KNEES SMOTE TOGETHER

A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE WAS EXPECTED CERTAIN INTIMATION WAS CONVEYED TO A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE THAT A BOX MIGHT BE EXPECTED BY THE THREE O'CLOCK MORNING TRAIN FROM THE SOUTH WHICH MIGHT CONTAIN A MAN
BUT IN THE MULTITUDE OF TRAVELERS COMING UNDER THE NOTICE OF THE COMMITTEE NANCY'S STORY WAS SOON FORGOTTEN AND NEW AND MARVELLOUS NARRATIVES WERE TOLD OF OTHERS WHO HAD SHARED THE SAME BITTER CUP WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM THE SAME HELL OF SLAVERY WHO HAD PANTED FOR THE SAME FREEDOM AND WON THE SAME PRIZE
IN MAKING UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE SLAVERY THE OUTRAGE INFLICTED UPON HIS MOTHER ONLY TENDED TO INCREASE HIS RESOLUTION

DERRIX TOWNSEND 442
THE THOUSANDS THAT PASSED SAFELY THROUGH HIS HANDS ON THEIR WAY TO CANADA AND THE NORTH WILL NEVER FORGET HIS FATHERLY SOLICITUDE FOR THEIR WELFARE OR THE DANGERS HE UNFLINCHINGLY ENCOUNTERED IN THEIR BEHALF
HENRY EXPRESSED HIS OBLIGATIONS ETC AND RETURNED TO THE AMERICAN HOTEL
I LIVED AWHILE IN WEST CHESTER AND LIVED IN CHESTER COUNTY UNTIL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN BUT HAD NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE THE CARE OF EITHER OF THEM
ANOTHER AND GREATER REASON WHY SHE WAS MORE KNOWN ABROAD THAN HER SISTER E WAS THAT SHE WROTE WITH FACILITY AND CORRESPONDED AT INTERVALS WITH MANY ON THESE MATTERS MR MCKIM AND OTHERS AND FOR MANY YEARS ABIGAIL WAS EMPHATICALLY OF THE TYPE OF THE POOR WIDOW WHO CAST IN ALL HER LIVING
THOMAS WAS OF PURE BLOOD WITH A VERY CHEERFUL HEALTHY-LOOKING COUNTENANCE,--TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE AND WAS TO COME FREE AT TWENTY-FIVE BUT HE HAD TOO MUCH GOOD SENSE TO RELY UPON THE PROMISES OF SLAVE-HOLDERS IN MATTERS OF THIS KIND
OF COURSE I SHALL BE JUST AS LIKELY TO HEAR FROM HOME THERE AS HERE
SHIPLEY THOS 698-710
THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHORITIES THREE WHITE MEN AND TWENTY-SEVEN COLORED HAD BEEN SAFELY LODGED IN MOYAMENSING PRISON UNDER THE CHARGE OF TREASON
GEORGE AND ANGELINE WHO WAS HIS SISTER WITH HER TWO BOYS HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WHITE BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS AND BELONGED TO A WEALTHY MAN BY THE NAME OF GEORGE SCHAEFFER WHO WAS IN THE MILLING BUSINESS
HER HIGHEST HAPPINESS AAD PLEASURE IN LIFE SEEMED TO BE DERIVED FROM RENDERING ACTS OF KINDNESS TO THE OPPRESSED
BY TRADE THOMAS WAS ALSO A BLACKSMITH
THE MOMENT THAT IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF THE SOUTH WAR WAS INEVITABLE
TO PROCURE THESE WRITS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE SIGNATURE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW JERSEY WHO RESIDED AT NEWARK AND AGAIN THOMAS SHIPLEY WAS READY TO ENTER WITH ALACRITY INTO THE SERVICE
WESLEY WILLIAMS ON HIS ARRIVAL FROM WARRICK MARYLAND TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF A MAN KNOWN BY THE NAME OF JACK JONES FROM WHOM HE HAD RECEIVED ALMOST DAILY FLOGGINGS AND SCANTY FOOD
IF YOU PLEASE YOU WILL FORWARD THE TICKETS BY TO-MORROW'S MAIL AS WE DO NOT HAVE A MAIL AGAIN TILL THIRD DAY
ALTHOUGH JACOB WAS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF SLAVERY UNDER HIS MASTER MAJOR WILLIAM HUTCHINS WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS A FARMER COMMISSIONER DRUNKARD AND HARD MASTER TO KNOW THAT NO HOPE COULD BE EXPECTED FROM HIM BUT IF HE REMAINED HE WOULD DAILY HAVE TO BE UNDER THE HARROW THE DESIRE TO WORK FOR HIMSELF WAS SO STRONG THAT HE COULD NOT RECONCILE HIS MIND TO THE DEMANDS OF SLAVERY
I HAVE BEEN TREATED BAD
ABE SPOKE WITH FEELINGS OF SOME BITTERNESS OF A FARMER KNOWN BY THE NAME OF GEORGE SPENCER WHO HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF THE HARD EARNINGS OF HIS HANDS
PLEASE TO ANSWER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
CHARLES HENRY IS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE OF GOOD PROPORTION NICE-LOOKING AND INTELLIGENT
YOU SHALL NOT FORCE THE CORRUPTED AND CORRUPTING BLOOD OF THAT SYSTEM INTO EVERY VEIN AND ARTERY OF OUR BODY POLITIC
HIS WIFE WAS A TOLERABLY WELL-DISPOSED WOMAN IN SOME INSTANCES--SHE WAS A TALL THIN-VISAGED WOMAN AND STOOD HIGH IN THE COMMUNITY
MR RATTRAY IS NOW BRINGING THE SUBJECT BEFORE HIS PEOPLE AND IS ALSO INTENDING TO PLANT WITH COTTON SOME GROUND BELONGING TO THE MISSION STATION

J6-1WW2
IT WAS SO COMMON FOR HER MISTRESS TO GIVE WAY TO UNBRIDLED PASSIONS THAT NANCY NEVER FELT SAFE
DON'T TELL THEM ANY THING ABOUT THEIR ELEVATION
I WAS THINKING A FEW DAYS AGO THAT NATURE HAD GIVING US A COUNTRY ADOPTED ALL THINGS SUTABLE
DURING THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE OF THIS INFAMOUS BILL THE POSITION HE HAD ATTAINED HERE WAS OF PARTICULAR SERVICE
THIS FACT WAS COMMUNICATED TO WASHINGTON AND IT BEING THE ONLY RESOURCE LEFT THE TIME NAMED WAS NECESSARILY ACQUIESCED IN
HE WOULD OFTEN THREATEN TO SELL AND WAS VERY HARD TO PLEASE GEORGE AND ANGELINE LEFT THEIR MOTHER AND TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS
HE LIVED AT SMITHFIELD NORTH CAROLINA
MOLLY DESCRIBED HER MASTER AS AN INDULGENT ONE WHEN SOBER BUT WHEN HE WAS ON A SPREE HE SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT DELIGHT IN TORMENTING HER
AT THE SAME TIME IT MAY BE SEEN HOW MUCH ANXIETY CARE HAZARD DELAY AND MATERIAL AID WERE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE DELIVERANCE OF SOME WHO WERE IN CLOSE PLACES AND DIFFICULT OF ACCESS
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN THE COUNTRY HER FATHER MOTHER THREE BROTHERS AND ONE SISTER WERE LIVING
WELL FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR COMMON HUMAN NATURE WE MAY HOPE THAT IT WAS SO

YOURS TRULY FRIEND C.A
COMMONLY HE WAS REGARDED AS A MAN OF WEALTH
HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN SOME PAIN AND SAID
FOR THIRTY YEARS ISAAC HAD HIRED HIS TIME FOUND HIMSELF IN FOOD CLOTHING AND EVERYTHING YET AS HE ADVANCED IN YEARS NEITHER HIS TASK NOR HIS HIRE WAS DIMINISHED BUT ON THE CONTRARY HIS HIRE OF LATE YEARS HAD BEEN INCREASED
IF TO DO THUS AND BEAR THUS AND LIVE THUS IS ACTION THEN MY FATHER DID ACT TO THE FULL PURPOSE OF LIFE IN THE STRUGGLE THAT FREED THE SLAVE
ANTI-SLAVERY PAPERS LECTURERS PREACHERS ETC ARRAYED THEMSELVES BOLDLY AGAINST IT ON THE GROUND OF ITS INHUMANITY AND VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF GOD
AS JOHN'S WIFE WAS ON THE EVE OF BEING SOLD HE WAS PROMPTED TO LEAVE SOME TIME SOONER THAN HE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE DONE
STILL:--SIR--I WRITE YOU THIS TO INFORM YOU THAT I HAS RECEIVED MY THINGS AND THAT YOU NEED NOT SAY ANY THING TO BAGNUL ABOUT THEM--I SEE BY THE PAPER THAT THE UNDER GROUND RAIL ROAD IS IN OPERATION
MY DEAR STILL:--YOURS OF THE 15TH REACHED ON THE 11TH FOUND MYSELF AND FAMILY VERY WELL AND NOT TO DELAY NO TIME IN REPLYING TO YOU AS THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN YOUR LETTER WHICH ARTICLE ROUSED ME VERY MUCH WHEN I READ IT

MY MOTHER AND ELEVEN SISTERS AND BROTHERS ARE NOW LIVING
BASSETT U.S
FROM BISHOP PAYNE OF THE A.M.E
FOR EIGHT YEARS PRIOR TO HIS ESCAPE HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT A PART OF THE TIME AS PORTER IN A GROCERY STORE THE REMAINDER AS BAR-TENDER IN A SALOON
HE TOO BELONGED TO CAIN WHO HE SAID WAS CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT SELLING ETC
JAMES CONNER SHOT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY
THE SUFFERINGS THAT HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO ENDURE HAD OPENED HIS EYES AND HE STOOD STILL TO WAIT FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAR AS HE ANXIOUSLY WISHED TO TRAVEL NORTH WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED
DURING ALL HIS PRIME DAYS HE WAS IN THE FAITHFUL AND CONSTANT SERVICE OF THOSE WHO HAD NO JUST CLAIM UPON HIM
25 60 DEAR SIR:--I TAKE THE PLEASURE OF DROPPING YOU A FEW LINES I AM YET RESIDING IN BRANTFORD AND I HAVE BEEN TO WORK ALL THIS SUMMER AT THE FALLS AND I HAVE GOT ALONG REMARKABLY WELL SURELY GOD IS GOOD TO THOSE THAT PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT HAS BECOME OF ME BUT I AM IN THE LANDS OF LIVING AND LONG TO HEAR FROM YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
AS THEY DREW NEARER AND NEARER HE BEGAN TO GROW NERVOUS
YET IN POINT OF COURAGE SHREWDNESS AND DISINTERESTED EXERTIONS TO RESCUE HER FELLOW-MEN BY MAKING PERSONAL VISITS TO MARYLAND AMONG THE SLAVES SHE WAS WITHOUT HER EQUAL
HE HID HIMSELF IN A STEAMER AND BY THIS WAY REACHED PHILADELPHIA WHERE HE RECEIVED EVERY ACCOMMODATION AT THE USUAL DEPOT WAS PROVIDED WITH A FREE TICKET AND SENT OFF REJOICING FOR CANADA
HUNDREDS WERE ENTERTAINED IN HIS HUMBLE HOME AND IT WAS IN HIS HOME THAT THE GORSUCH MURDERER WAS SECRETED
HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND THEN INQUIRED IF THAT YOUNG MAN WAS MR BRADLEY'S BROTHER
VANDYKE THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT ATTORNEY SWORE HE WOULD TAKE HER
HIS CAREER WAS FULL OF DRAMATIC INTEREST FROM BEGINNING TO END AND CROWDED WITH THE EXPERIENCES AND VICISSITUDES OF A MOST EVENTFUL NATURE
IF YOUR PRESIDENT HAD BUT TAKEN THE STEP AT FIRST HE IS TAKING NOW WHAT RIVERS OF BLOOD MIGHT HAVE BEEN STAYED
AND DO NOT FORGET TO WRITE THE NEWS OF MEAKIN'S TRYAL
OCCASIONALLY HOWEVER THE COOK A COLORED WOMAN MRS SMITH WOULD MANAGE TO GET TO SEE ME
A BOOK SO UNIQUE IN KIND SO STARTLING IN INTEREST AND SO TRUSTWORTHY IN ITS STATEMENTS CANNOT FAIL TO COMMAND A LARGE READING NOW AND IN GENERATIONS YET TO COME
BAIL WAS DEMANDED IN THE SAME SUM AND WAS PROMPTLY FURNISHED
I FORGOT TO INQUIRE OF DR T
ISAAC FORMAN THE YOUNGEST OF THE PARTY--TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE AND A DARK MULATTO--WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY A SOUTHERNER CAPABLE OF JUDGING AS VERY LIKELY HE FLED FROM A WIDOW BY THE NAME OF MRS SANDERS WHO HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF HIRING HIM OUT FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR SHE BELONGED IN NORFOLK VA
THOMAS JERVIS THE ELDER BOY WAS QUITE DARK AND STAMMERED SOMEWHAT YET HE WAS ACTIVE AND SMART
JOHN WAS QUITE SMART AND LOOKED NONE THE WORSE FOR HAVING SO MUCH OF HIS MASTER'S BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
THE FIRST WAS MARKS A THIN-VISAGED POOR-LOOKING MAN GREAT FOR SWEARING THE SECOND WAS GILBERT BROWER A VERY RASH PORTLY MAN THE THIRD WAS BUCK YOUNG A STOUT MAN AND VERY SHARP THE FOURTH WAS LYNN POWELL A TALL MAN WITH RED WHISKERS VERY CONTRARY AND SPITEFUL THERE WAS ALSO A FIFTH ONE BUT HIS NAME WAS LOST
I AM GLAD THAT THE COLORED MAN GETS HIS FREEDOM AND SUFFRAGE TOGETHER
YOU WILL GREATLY OBLIGE ME BY SO DOING
THEY WERE OF ONE MIND IN REPRESENTING HIM AS A HARD MAN
HIS NAME IS SIMPLY ENTERED ON THE ROLL AND BUT FOR LETTERS RECEIVED FROM HIM AFTER HE PASSED ON NORTH NO FURTHER KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED
WHEN I GOT TIRED OF STAYING IN THAT PLACE I WROTE MYSELF A PASS TO PASS MYSELF TO PETERSBURG HERE I STOPPED WITH A VERY PROMINENT COLORED PERSON WHO WAS A FRIEND TO FREEDOM STAYED HERE UNTIL TWO WHITE FRIENDS TOLD OTHER FRIENDS IF I WAS IN THE CITY TO TELL ME TO GO AT ONCE AND STAND NOT UPON THE ORDER OF GOING BECAUSE THEY HAD HARD A PLOT
KANE COL
OR WHO TOOK MORE JOYFULLY THE SPOILING OF HIS GOODS AS THE PENALTY OF HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE HUNTED FUGITIVE
IF THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO FAITH IN GOODNESS AND EARNESTNESS THAT IS ONLY ONE REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE MORE FAITHFUL AND EARNEST AND SO I SHALL PROBABLY STAY HERE IN THE SOUTH ALL WINTER
HOW HE PRESERVED THEM DOES NOT MATTER MUCH NOW BUT IF A CERTAIN LOFT IN THE CHAPEL OF AN OLD CEMETERY COULD SPEAK IT MIGHT A TALE UNFOLD
IF HE HAD BEEN ANYTHING LIKE HIS WIFE IN DISPOSITION MOST LIKELY CAROLINE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN BONDAGE
BROWN JOHN 514
HOW THE HUSBAND WAS TREATED THE RECORD BOOK IS SILENT
BUT HE AFTERWARDS WITHDREW HIS OBJECTIONS AND NOTIFIED MR MCMURTRIE THAT HE WOULD REQUIRE ANY WITNESSES HE MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION SHOULD RETIRE ALSO
HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE IF THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE COULD BECOME ABLE TEACHERS OF OUR OWN REARING AND IN DAYS TO COME BE LOOKED TO AS MAINTAINING SCHOOLS OF AN ELEVATED CHARACTER UPON THEIR NATIVE SOIL
THE MAYOR OF THE CITY WITH A POSSE OF OFFICERS WITH AXES AND LONG SPEARS REPAIRED TO CAPTAIN F.'S BOAT
AT FIRST THE LAW WAS DERIDED AND CONDEMNED BY OUR LIBERTY-LOVING CITIZENS AND THE FUGITIVES DID NOT FEAR ITS OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY ASSERTED THAT THEY COULD PROTECT THEMSELVES
I GAVE THEM LETTERS TO A FRIEND THERE AFTER FURNISHING THEM AS WELL AS I COULD WITH SUCH CLOTHING AS THEY REQUIRED
THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES ARRESTED IN NEW YORK AND GIVEN UP TO THEIR OWNERS
IT WILL TEACH THE COMING GENERATIONS WHO WERE OUR FATHERS AND OUR MOTHERS
HE TOLD ONE OF MY NEGROES HE WAS GOING TO NORFOLK TO SELL SOME PLUNDER HE HAD THERE THEN GO TO RICHMOND STEAL HIS WIFE GET ON BOARD A BOAT ABOUT NORFOLK AND GO TO A FREE STATE
YES I HERE HIM ENOUGH HE IS ALL GAS
AMONGST THOSE CONSULTED WERE TWO OR THREE CAPTAINS WHO HAD ON FORMER OCCASIONS DONE GOOD SERVICE IN THE CAUSE
WITH RESOLUTION HIS FREEDOM WAS SECURED
TILL QUITE RECENTLY HE WAS INTENDING TO RETURN TO ENGLAND VERY SOON BUT THIS IS FOR THE PRESENT DELAYED ON ACCOUNT OF INCREASING AND PRESSING ENGAGEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES
SHE WAS NEAT MODEST AND WELL-BEHAVED--WITH A GOOD FIGURE AND THE PICTURE OF HEALTH WITH A COUNTENANCE BEAMING WITH JOY AND GLADNESS NOTWITHSTANDING THE LATE STRUGGLES AND SUFFERINGS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD PASSED
HE LEFT HIS FATHER GRAND-MOTHER FOUR SISTERS AND TWO BROTHERS ALL LIVING WHERE HE FLED FROM
HE WAS DISINTERRED AGAIN AND THE SAME TWO EMINENT PHYSICIANS MADE A THOROUGH POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION AND ONE OF THEM TOLD THE WRITER THAT THERE WERE NOT TWO OUNCES OF CONTENTS IN HIS STOMACH AND BOWELS AND THAT THERE WAS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF ARSENIC
JAMES HENRY THE THIRD PASSENGER WAS ABOUT THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE AND QUITE A SPIRITED-LOOKING ARTICLE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE FLED HE HAD BEEN SOLD AT WHICH TIME HIS AGE WAS GIVEN AS ONLY TWENTY HE HAD SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY FROM VARIOUS ABUSES
IT IS BELIEVED THAT NO SLAVE WAS EVER RECAPTURED THAT FOLLOWED HIS DIRECTIONS
OR IF YOU CANNOT DO EITHER SEND ME YOUR LATEST INFORMATION FOR I INTEND TO MAKE HIM SPEND A FEW MORE DOLLARS AND IF POSSIBLE GET A LITTLE SICKER OF THIS BAD JOB
IT WAS EVIDENT THEREFORE IN HARRY'S OPINION THAT THE SOONER HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FOR CANADA THE BETTER
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD OFFERED--MCHENRY AND MCCULLOCH ANXIOUS ABOUT JOHN
FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR JOURNEY THEY AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BUT HAD TO SUFFER FROM THE COLD WEATHER THEY ENCOUNTERED
BEFORE THE EVENING GREW LATE THE DR FEARING SOME ACCIDENT INTIMATED THAT HE WAS FEELING A LITTLE LANGUID AND THEREFORE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BETTER RETIRE FURTHERMORE HE ADDED THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO VERTIGO WHEN NOT QUITE WELL AND FOR THIS REASON HE MUST HAVE HIS BOY JOE SLEEP IN THE ROOM WITH HIM
SEND ME WORD WHAT I CAN DO FOR THE FUGITIVES
THE MAJOR IN DISPOSITION WAS VERY ABUSIVE AND PROFANE THOUGH OLD AND GREY-HEADED
WHILE ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION PETER WAS ASKED ABOUT THE KIND AND CHARACTER OF PREACHING THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR
WHY IS IT BEFORE YOU TAKING YOUR TIME DAY AFTER DAY
THE CAPTURE OF JOHN BROWN'S PAPERS AND LETTERS WITH NAMES AND PLANS IN FULL ADMONISHED US THAT SUCH PAPERS AND CORRESPONDENCE AS HAD BEEN PRESERVED CONCERNING THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MIGHT PERCHANCE BE CAPTURED BY A PRO-SLAVERY MOB
I WISH YOO WOULD SEE THE DOCTOR FOR ME AND ASK HIM IF HE COULD CAREFULLY FIND OUT ANY WAY THAT WE COULD STEAL LITTLE JOHNY FOR I THINK TO RAISE NINE OR TEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SUCH A CHILD IS OUTRAIGUST
MY JOY WITHIN IS SO GREAT THAT I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS IT
CHRISTMAS WEEK HE WAS CONFIDENT WOULD BE GRANTED AS USUAL AS A HOLIDAY WEEK
THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW TO PUT A POLICE OFFICER ON BOARD EVERY VESSEL AS SOON AS SHE LANDS AT THE WHARF
BEING FAMILIAR WITH THE CUSTOMS OF THIS TERRIBLE BOLDIN,--OF THE STARVING FARE AND CRUEL FLOGGING USUAL ON HIS FARM JOHN MUSTERED COURAGE TO DECLARE AT THE SALE THAT HE WOULD NOT SERVE HIM IN THE HEARING OF HIS NEW MASTER HE SAID BEFORE I WILL SERVE HIM I WILL CUT MY THROAT THE MASTER SMILED AND SIMPLY ASKED FOR A ROPE
THE LORD REWARD YOU
HE WILL SOON COME IN FROM SOUTH STREET WHERE HE HAS WORKED TO-DAY WHILE WE WERE CONSULTING TOGETHER SURE ENOUGH THE MAN CAME IN AND WAS MOST GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THUS AFFORDED OF SECRETING HIMSELF
GREEN 208
AFTER ARRIVING THERE HE WROTE BACK TO HIS YOUNG MASTER TO LET HIM KNOW WHERE HE WAS AND WHY HE LEFT AND WHAT HE WAS DOING
BEING THE ONLY SLAVE ON THE PLACE THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM
THAT ROMANCE IS NOW ENDED AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL HARDLY BELIEVE ITS LEADING INCIDENTS EXCEPT ON IRRESISTIBLE TESTIMONY
THE LIBERAL APPROPRIATION FOR TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN MADE CHIEFLY ON ACCOUNT OF A FEMALE CHILD OF TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS OLD FOR WHOSE PURCHASE I HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO OFFER $700 REFUSED AND FOR WHOSE SISTER I HAVE PAID $1,600 AND SOME $1,000 FOR THEIR MOTHER C
IN THE PRESENT CASE I SHALL FURNISH THEM WITH MONEY TO PAY THEIR FARE TO PHILADELPHIA AND JOHNSON HOME AGAIN
FOR THIS GRAVE CRIME HIS MASTER THREATENED TO GIVE HIM A HUNDRED LASHES AND TO SHOOT HIM
IN A FEW DAYS HOWEVER NAPOLEON WILL HAVE A ROOM DOWN TOWN AND AT ODD TIMES THEY CAN BE SENT THERE
WILLIAM HENRY MOODY BELINDA BIVANS C
HE WOULD ALSO TELL JOHN HOW MUCH BETTER OFF HE WAS AS A SLAVE WITH A KIND MASTER TO PROVIDE FOR ALL HIS WANTS ETC
THIS CANDIDATE FOR CANADA WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
AN INFLUENCE RADIATED FROM HIM THAT MADE ITSELF FELT IN EVERY COMPANY THOUGH HE WOULD VERY LIKELY BE THE MOST MODEST MAN PRESENT
NO ONE SOUTHERN CITY FURNISHED A LARGER NUMBER OF BRAVE WIDE-AWAKE AND LIKELY-LOOKING UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS THAN THE CITY OF RICHMOND
MAY THE LORD PRESERVE YOU UNTO ETERNAL LIFE
IN HIS PURSE WAS FOUND ONE SINGLE FIVE CENT PIECE HIS WHOLE PECUNIARY DEPENDENCE
THERE HE HIRED ON BOARD THE SCHOONER THOMAS AND EDWARD OYSTER BOAT OF BALTIMORE
HOW OFTEN HAVE I HEARD HIM SAY I KNOW NOTHING OF WHAT THE HARVEST WILL BE
DAVIDSON WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED SINCE THE 20TH INST
AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL ALL THAT WAS RECORDED OF THEIR BONDAGE IS AS FOLLOWS AUGUST 2D 1855 ROBERT JONES AND WIFE ARRIVED FROM PETERSBURG VA
BUT THEY ARE UTTERLY DESTITUTE
I WENT IN AS SHE ORDERED ME
CLARKSON TAYLOR THEN SAID THAT THE TIME FOR CLOSING THE SERVICES HAD ARRIVED AND IN A VERY FEW WORDS COMMENDED THE LESSON OF HIS LIFE TO THOSE PRESENT AFTER WHICH THE MEETING DISSOLVED AND THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE GRAVE-YARD IN THE REAR OF THE MEETING-HOUSE AND DEPOSITED IN ITS LAST RESTING-PLACE
THE SLAVE-MASTER CONFIDENT IN HIS RIGHTS BOLD IN THE COUNTRY OF THOSE PRETENDED FREEMEN WHO WERE EVER READY TO KISS THE ROD OF SLAVERY CAME SLOWLY RIDING INTO NORRISTOWN JUST BEFORE SUNSET WITH THE ROPE STILL FAST TO THE SLAVE'S NECK
CHARLES GILBERT
REFER TO N.E
IS THERE NO RAY OF HOPE IN THAT
IN SUCH AN EVENT I FELT THAT I SHOULD NOT ONLY LOSE ALL I HAD EVER EARNED BUT PERIL THE HOPES AND PROPERTY OF OTHERS SO THAT I WOULD HAVE FREELY GIVEN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HAVE BEEN INSURED AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A RIOT
CONSEQUENTLY WILLIAM HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS HANDS LONG
MARY COMPLAINED THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED SEVERELY FOR FOOD AND LIKEWISE FOR PRIVILEGES
REBECCA JACKSON AND DAUGHTER AND ROBERT SHORTER
EMORY WAS INDUCED TO LEAVE TO AVOID A TERRIBLE FLOGGING WHICH HAD BEEN PROMISED HIM FOR THE COMING MONDAY
HE RAISED HIS VOICE ALOUD AND ADDRESSED THE MULTITUDE
ONE OF THE POLICEMEN STATED THAT HE HAD NOTICED A STRANGE COLORED BOY WITH PROFESSOR LESLEY'S CHILDREN
THE MAIN CAUSE OF HER FLIGHT WAS TO KEEP FROM BEING SOLD AGAIN
THEY SHOWERED INEFFABLE CONTEMPT UPON HIM IN EVERY WAY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR LITTLENESS AND--REFINEMENT
I HAD TWENTY-FIVE TAKEN FROM ME WITHOUT BEING ALLOWED THE FIRST COPPER
SHE SPOKE VERY ANGRY AND SAID SHE DIDN'T GO BY OTHER FOLKS BUT SHE HAD RULES OF HER OWN
IN THE PRESENCE OF A GROUP LIKE THIS SUMNER'S GREAT AND ELOQUENT SPEECH ON THE BARBARISM OF SLAVERY SEEMED ALMOST COLD AND DEAD,--THE MUTE APPEALS OF THESE LITTLE ONES IN THEIR MOTHER'S ARMS--THE UNLETTERED LANGUAGE OF THESE YOUNG MOTHERS STRIVING TO SAVE THEIR OFFSPRING FROM THE DOOM OF SLAVERY--THE RESOLUTE AND MANLY BEARING OF THESE BROTHERS EXPRESSED IN WORDS FULL OF LOVE OF LIBERTY AND OF THE DETERMINATION TO RESIST SLAVERY TO THE DEATH IN DEFENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN--THIS WAS SUMNER'S SPEECH ENACTED BEFORE OUR EYES
THEY ARE A CHEERFUL HAPPY COMPANY AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR FREEDOM
AGAINST THE SAID UNITED STATES AND THEN AND THERE WITH FORCE AND ARMS IN PURSUANCE OF SUCH THEIR TRAITOROUS INTENTION HE THE SAID JAMES JACKSON WITH THE SAID PERSONS SO AS AFORESAID WICKEDLY AND TRAITOROUSLY DID LEVY WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
WILLIAM HAD SEEN MUCH OF THE DARK DOINGS OF SLAVERY AND HIS MIND HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SET AGAINST THE SYSTEM
HE ALLEGED THAT HE HAD VERY SERIOUS CAUSE FOR GRIEVANCE
AFTER THEIR PRESSING WANTS HAD BEEN MET BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND AFTER PARTIAL RECUPERATION FROM THEIR HARD TRAVEL ETC THEY WERE FORWARDED ON TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN NEW YORK
ON THE CARS SOME FIND OUT THAT I AM A LECTURER AND THEN AGAIN I AM DRAWN INTO CONVERSATION
ALSO IF YOU WISH TO WRITE TO ME MR J
AFTER LEAVING SLAVERY WILLIAM CHANGED HIS LAST NAME TO WILLIAMS AND IF HE AND HIS WIFE ARE NOW LIVING THEY ARE KNOWN ONLY BY THEIR ADOPTED NAMES
AND THIRDLY ON THEIR DISCHARGE TO RENDER THEM SUCH PRACTICAL AID AS SHALL ENABLE THE REPENTANT TO RETURN TO SOCIETY BY MEANS OF THE PURSUIT OF SOME HONEST CALLING
NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE NOT TURNED AWAY EMPTY THOUGH AT A PERIL THEY WERE FED AIDED AND COMFORTED AND SENT AWAY WELL CLOTHED
I BEG YOU WILL INFORM ME WHETHER TWO OTHERS--(I WHOSE WIFE IS IN PHILADELPHIA WAS ONE OF THEM EVER REACHED YOUR CITY
CATHARINE UPPER CANADA WEST
FROM HER BIRTH TO THE HOUR OF HER ESCAPE SHE HAD WORN THE YOKE UNDER MRS C AS HER MOST EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE MAID-SERVANT
J.C
OBVIOUSLY THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW IN ITS CRUSADE AGAINST WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT REAPED NO ADVANTAGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY LIBERTY WAS GREATLY THE GAINER
HERE ALLOW ME TO PAY A BRIEF TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS
YOURS MOST RESPECTFULL
ONE OF THE NIGHTS THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE STOVE AND THE NEXT TIME WE HAD FIRES ONE STOVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SECOND-HAND CHAMBER STOVE
WHERE THE REV
SMITH JAMES 454
HIS WIFE LIVES WITH HER MOTHER ANN ROBERTSON IN CORN ALLEY BETWEEN LEE AND HILL STREETS BALTIMORE CITY WHERE HE HAS OTHER RELATIONS AND WHERE HE IS MAKING HIS WAY
SECRETED TEN MONTHS BEFORE STARTING--EIGHT DAYS STOWED AWAY ON A STEAMER BOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA
IT WAS THE LAST OF AUGUST A YEAR AGO
AND MARY JANE BOTH SLAVES
HE SOON LEARNED TO BE A VERY RIGID ECONOMIST AND BEING EXCEEDINGLY ACCOMMODATING IN WAITING UPON GENTLEMEN AT THE HOTEL AND AT THE SPRINGS HE FOUND HIS LITTLE PILE INCREASING WEEKLY
AS A SPECIMEN OF THE BOLDNESS THOUGH FORTUNATELY NOT OF THE SUCCESS ALWAYS WITH WHICH THESE WRETCHES PROSECUTE THEIR NEFARIOUS TRADE READ THE ENCLOSED ARTICLE WHICH I CUT FROM THE FREEMAN OF JANUARY 2D AND BEAR IN MIND THAT IN NO RESPECT ARE THE FACTS HERE MENTIONED OVER-STATED
LET US REJOICE THAT IN OUR COUNTRY SUCH NARRATIVES CAN NEVER BE HEARD AGAIN
AARON M
ARRIVAL OF FIVE FROM THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND
AND IF ANY GLIMPSE SHOULD COME TO HIM OF THE LETHARGIC INHUMANITY AROUND HIM HE CAN AFFORD TO LET IT PASS AS A GLIMPSE--HIS LOOK BEING FIXED ON THE SACRED HEIGHTS WHICH THE SCHOLAR'S FEET MUST TREAD
TELL MY UNCLE TO GO TO RICHMOND AND ASK MY MOTHER WHEREABOUTS THIS MAN IS
HANNAH IS A HEARTY-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN OF 23 OR 24 WITH A COUNTENANCE THAT INDICATED THAT LIBERTY WAS WHAT SHE WANTED AND WAS CONTENDING FOR AND THAT SHE COULD NOT WILLINGLY SUBMIT TO THE YOKE
THE UNVARNISHED FACTS AS THEY WERE THEN RECORDED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE LIPS OF JIM AND AS THEY ARE HERE REPRODUCED COMPRISE ONLY A VERY MEAGRE PART OF HIS SADLY INTERESTING STORY
THE OTHER A MALE SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS OLD BRIGHT COLOR
QUITE DARK SLENDER BUILT SPEAKS SHORT AND STAMMERS SOME
SO HE AGAIN TRIED HIS POWER AT GROWLING AND BARKING HIDEOUSLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WHICH AT ONCE CAUSED THE MAN TO TURN HIS COURSE
A WOMAN LIVING WITH HIM IS A MOST EXCELLENT NURSE AND WILL TAKE A DEEP INTEREST IN THE CHILD WHICH NO DOUBT WILL UNDER PROVIDENCE BE THE MEANS OF ITS COMPLETE RESTORATION TO HEALTH
FREEDOM BROUGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR WORK AND WAGES COMBINED
THE FOLLOWING PERSONS WERE APPOINTED ON THE GENERAL VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
I HAVE ALREADY APPRIZED YOU OF MY ILLNESS AND MY CONSEQUENT INABILITY TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE AS WOULD BE WORTHY OF YOUR PUBLICATION
HIS FAITH WAS STRONGER THAN EVER
DUTTON CHAS ALIAS WM
I TOLD HIM NO SIR I WOULDN'T
AT THAT TIME IT WAS VERY LITTLE BETTER IN THE NORTH THAN IT WAS IN THE SOUTH
I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHO HE IS AND SHOULD I BE ABLE TO LEARN THE NAME OF THE BALTIMORE FRIEND I WILL PUT HIM ON HIS GUARD RESPECTING HIS PHILA
I ASKED IN MY LETTER IF MR WILLIAMS WAS ON THE PENNSYLVANIA THAT RUNS FROM THEIR TO RICHMOND VA
ANTHONY AND ALBERT BROWN BROTHERS JONES ANDERSON AND ISAIAH
STEPNEY WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN HIS COUNTENANCE INDICATING GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART AND HIS GRATITUDE TO HIS HEAVENLY FATHER FOR HIS DELIVERANCE PROVED THAT HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE SOURCE WHENCE HIS HELP HAD COME
HE IS VERY BLACK
MANIFESTATIONS LIKE THESE HAVE WE BEEN OBLIGED EITHER TO WITNESS OURSELVES OR HEAR THE RECITAL OF FROM OTHERS ALMOST DAILY FOR WEEKS TOGETHER
THE MAN WHO PROFESSED TO OWN HIM HE CALLED WILLIAM TAYLOR AND HE WAS A VERY HARD MAN ONE OF THE KIND WHICH COULD NOT BE PLEASED NOR GIVE A SLAVE A PLEASANT ANSWER ONE TIME IN FIFTY BEING THOROUGHLY SICK OF WILLIAM TAYLOR HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND CANADA
I DO NOT IN LECTURING CONFINE MYSELF TO THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THE QUESTION
RILEY J.P
MOST VIVIDLY DID HE DRAW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE STATES OF GEORGIA AND PENNSYLVANIA WITH REGARD TO THE ATROCIOUS LAWS OF GEORGIA
BUT BEN
IN THE MIDST OF HER SEVEREST AGONIES HER CHIEF FEAR WAS THAT SHE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND CARRIED BACK TO SLAVERY
WE KNEW NOT THAT THESE GOODS WERE TO COME CONSEQUENTLY WE WERE ALL TAKEN BY SURPRISE
IN EVERY RESPECT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD MADE CAPITAL BY THE TREASON
HE LEFT A WIFE AND CHILD BOTH FREE
WILMINGTON 5 MO
STEPHEN ENNETS AND WIFE MARIA WITH THREE CHILDREN WHOSE NAMES WERE AS FOLLOWS
SHE WAS A SINGLE YOUNG WOMAN ABOUT TWENTY-TWO WITH AS PLEASANT A COUNTENANCE AS ONE WOULD WISH TO SEE
CRAFT TOOK CARE TO INFORM THEM WHO AND WHAT HE WAS
JOHN J
AND THIS OVERMASTERING LOVE OF SAVING SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY WAS ONE POWER THAT MADE THEM AND HEART-EASE HOLD UNFAILING FRIENDS THROUGH THE OBLOQUY OF THOSE DAYS
HE WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO DIE OR HE WOULD LOSE ME AND I WOULD NOT BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM SO HE TOOK AND TRADED ME OFF FOR A WAGON
IN FACT TIME ONLY COULD BE AFFORDED FOR NOTICING VERY BRIEFLY SOME OF THE MORE REMARKABLE EVENTS OF HIS BONDAGE
HE SAYS TO US WHEN WRITING FROM LONDON ON THE 19TH INST OUR SCHEME EMBRACES MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE AND TO ILLUSTRATE THIS I SEND A MAP WITH PROSPECTUS OF THE PROPOSED ESTATE BY WHICH YOU WILL SEE THAT WE RECKON ON OBTAINING COTTON BY FREE LABOR AND BY MECHANICAL AGENCY FROM JAMAICA AT A PRICE SO FAR BELOW THAT AT WHICH IT CAN BE PRODUCED BY SLAVE LABOR THAT IF WE SUCCEED WE SHALL PUT AN END TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM AS NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO CARRY IT ON IN COMPETITION WITH FREE LABOR JAMAICA IS MUCH NEARER AND EASIER OF ACCESS FOR FUGITIVES FROM CUBA AND PORTO RICO THAN CANADA IS TO GEORGIA VIRGINIA OR LOUISIANA
HE WAS ONLY TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE BUT THAT PUNISHMENT CONVINCED HIM THAT HE WAS FULLY OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE SUCH A MASTER AS E
SHE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT HIS GOING TO CANADA AND OF COURSE WAS TRUE TO HIM
WE SHALL ATTEMPT NO ABSTRACT OF HER ADDRESS
THEY HAVE MINISTERED MORE THAN THE CUP OF WATER ITEM 19TH
SIX OF THE OTHERS HOWEVER MARVELLOUSLY GOT OFF SAFELY TOGETHER
WHEN A GIRL ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE HER YOUNG MIND STRONGLY REVOLTED AGAINST BEING A SLAVE AND AT THAT YOUTHFUL PERIOD SHE TRIED HER FORTUNE AT RUNNING AWAY
COOPER HENRY 319
HE HAD BEEN KEPT IN AS LOW A STATE OF IGNORANCE AS THE INGENUITY OF A SLAVE-HOLDER OF DELAWARE COULD KEEP ONE POSSESSED OF AS MUCH MOTHER-WIT AS HE WAS FOR HE WAS NOT QUITE SO IGNORANT AS THE INTERESTS OF THE SYSTEM REQUIRED
HE COULD NEITHER LIVE WITH HIS WIFE NOR COULD HE HAVE ANY COMMAND OVER ONE OF HIS CHILDREN
NOT TO STOP FOR WANT OF MEANS FOR I WILL FORWARD MEANS ON TO MY FRIEND WM STILL
FORTUNATELY LEWIS WIFE ESCAPED THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE OF HIM IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
AND ONCE HE KEPT HIM OUT IN THE COLD UNTIL HIS TOES WERE FROZEN OFF
IN 1857 WHEN THESE REMARKABLE TRAVELERS CAME UNDER THE NOTICE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AS SLAVERY SEEMED LIKELY TO LAST FOR GENERATIONS AND THERE WAS BUT LITTLE EXPECTATION THAT THESE RECORDS WOULD EVER HAVE THE HISTORICAL VALUE WHICH THEY NOW POSSESS CARE WAS NOT ALWAYS TAKEN TO PREPARE AND PRESERVE THEM
IN CASES LIKE THIS HOWEVER THE SIGHT AND LANGUAGE OF SUCH AN ONE WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE
AND HERE BY THE WAY LET ME SAY THAT ONE GREAT REASON WHY I REFER AS OFTEN AS I DO TO THAT GREAT TOPIC OF THE DAY WHICH IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER IS CONTINUALLY SHAKING THE LAND AND MARKING THE AGE IN WHICH WE LIVE IS NOT MERELY THE RIGHTING OF THE WRONGED BUT THE INSTRUCTION THE MORAL ENLIGHTENMENT THE RELIGIOUS EDIFICATION OF OUR OWN HEARTS WHICH THIS MOMENTOUS TOPIC AFFORDS
I SHALL DO WHAT I CAN FOR THEIR COMFORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT
THUS IN ACCORDANCE WITH WELL PREMEDITATED PLANS THEY SET OUT AND UNOBSTRUCTEDLY ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA
WITHOUT DIFFICULTY OF ANY KIND THEY DULY REACHED CANADA AND A PORTION OF THEM WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS
HE DRINKS A LITTLE TOO MUCH WHISKEY SOMETIMES BUT HE WILL DO ANYTHING I ASK HIM TO DO PROMPTLY AND OBLIGINGLY

HE IS OF CHESTNUT COLOR WELL MADE C AND CAME FROM SEAFORD MD
THE ATTEMPT PROVED A SUCCESS BEYOND HIS EXPECTATION
A RECORD OF FACTS AUTHENTIC NARRATIVES LETTERS C NARRATING THE HARDSHIPS HAIR-BREADTH ESCAPES AND DEATH STRUGGLES OF THE SLAVES IN THEIR EFFORTS FOR FREEDOM AS RELATED BY THEMSELVES AND OTHERS OR WITNESSED BY THE AUTHOR TOGETHER WITH SKETCHES OF SOME OF THE LARGEST STOCKHOLDERS AND MOST LIBERAL AIDERS AND ADVISERS OF THE ROAD
IN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE HE WOULD HAVE READILY PASSED FOR A SUPERIOR LABORER
DEFENCELESS INFANCY AND DECREPID AGE WERE ALIKE DISREGARDED IN THE GENERAL DEVASTATION WHICH THESE RUFFIANS HAD DECREED SHOULD ATTEND THEIR COURSE
HIRAM CORSON
THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT TAKEN FROM THE CAMBRIDGE DEMOCRAT OF NOVEMBER 4 SHOWS HOW THE REV
TO REST AND REFRESH HIMSELF IN THIS THICKET HE FELT WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO HIM
TOLD ME SO
TO MANAGE THE MATTER SMOOTHLY PREVIOUS TO SELLING THEM THE MASTER PRETENDED THAT HE WAS ONLY GOING TO HIRE THEM OUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM HOME BUT INSTEAD OF DOING SO HE SOLD THEM SOUTH
THE SYMPATHY SHOWN BY SO MANY FRIENDLY LADIES WAS NOT A FAVORABLE SIGN FOR THE SLAVE-HOLDER
THOUGH THE LAWS ROBBED HIM HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS COULD NOT BUT RESPECT AND TRUST HIM LOVE AND HONOR HIM
HE OWED SERVICES TO D
ROPES BEING TIED AROUND BOTH HIS WRISTS THE BLOCK AND TACKLE WERE FASTENED THERETO AND GEORGE SOON FOUND HIMSELF HOISTED ON TIP-TOE WITH HIS FEET ALMOST CLEAR OF THE FLOOR
HE WOULD LISTEN WITH MOISTENED EYES TO A TALE OF OUTRAGE AND GO AWAY SAYING NEVER A WORD
THIS LONG-CHERISHED PLAN HALLOWED TO HIM BY THE APPROBATION OF A BELOVED WIFE WAS WELL RECEIVED
BEN DICKINSON
THERE IS NOW MUCH MORE RISK ON THE ROAD TILL THEY ARRIVE HERE THAN THERE HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS PAST AS WE FIND THAT SOME POOR WORTHLESS WRETCHES ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOK OUT ON TWO ROADS THAT THEY CANNOT WELL AVOID MORE ESPECIALLY WITH CARRIAGE YET AS IT IS HARRIET WHO SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A SPECIAL ANGEL TO GUARD HER ON HER JOURNEY OF MERCY I HAVE HOPE
BUT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HIS FREEDOM AND FINDING HIS TWO COMPANIONS TRUE ON THE MAIN QUESTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEM HE CONTRIVED A PLAN OF ESCAPE AND TOOK OUT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HARRISON AND JANE TAYLOR WERE LEFT AT FREDERICKSBURG TO MOURN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR SON
THEY TELL ME THEY CAN PAY THE SUMS MARKED TO THEIR NAMES
FROM HUNDREDS THUS ADMONISHED LETTERS CAME AFFORDING THE MOST GRATIFYING EVIDENCE THAT THE COUNSEL OF THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT IN VAIN

BUT THE ENEMY WAS LURKING IN AMBUSH FOR HIM--THIRSTING FOR HIS BLOOD
BUT A CRISIS IS APPROACHING WHEN ASSENTIAL REQUISITE TO THE AMERICAN SLAVEHOLDERS WHEN BLOOD DEATH OR LIBERTY WILL BE REQUIRED AT THEIR HANDS
BUT WHATEVER HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH THEM IS ALL OF GOD TO WHOM ALONE IS THE GLORY DUE
ALL THE WHILE THEIR BRAVE SPIRITS UNDER SUFFERING GREW MORE AND MORE DARING
BARNABY'S CHANCES FOR MAKING EXTRA CHANGE FOR HIMSELF WERE NEVER FAVORABLE
MY MEANS OF SUPPORT ARE SO SCANTY THAT I AM OBLIGED TO WRITE WITHOUT PAYING POSTAGE OR NOT WRITE AT ALL
ALL WERE WELCOME TO ITS IMMUNITIES WHITE OR COLORED WHEN THE OBJECT TO BE GAINED FAVORED FREEDOM OR WEAKENED SLAVERY
PLEASED WITH THE PROMOTION I STROVE HARD TO GIVE SATISFACTION AND WAS GRATIFIED ON LEAVING THE SCHOOL TO HAVE AN OFFER OF A SITUATION AS TEACHER IF I WAS DISPOSED TO REMAIN
FAITHFULLY DID HE WATCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLUTION
IN THIS CASE AS WITH THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS AS THE OLD ADAGE FITLY EXPRESSES IT ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS UNDER THIS APPARENTLY PIOUS AND NOBLE-MINDED LADY IT WILL BE SEEN THAT CORDELIA HAD KNOWN NAUGHT BUT MISERY AND SORROW

MY JUDGMENT WAS AS A ROBE AND A DIADEM
HE OWNED PROPERTY IN MILFORD AND HE HAD A PLACE IN VICKSBURG AND SOME OF HIS TIME HE SPENDS THERE AND SOME OF THE TIME HE LIVES IN MILFORD
WHO HAS NOT ADMIRED THE SAGACITY WITH WHICH HIS INQUIRIES WERE DICTATED AND THE TACT AND ACUMEN WITH WHICH HE MANAGED EVERY PART OF HIS CAUSE
I WAS WALKING NEAR THE WATER SHE SAID WHEN A WHITE SAILOR SPOKE TO ME AND AFTER A FEW QUESTIONS OFFERED TO HIDE ME ON BOARD HIS VESSEL AND CONDUCT ME SAFELY TO NEW YORK IF I WOULD COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING

I CONGRATULATE YOU THAT AFTER MUCH PATIENT RESEARCH CAREFUL PREPARATION AND UNTIRING LABOR YOU HAVE COMPLETED YOUR VOLUMINOUS WORK ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD I AM SURE YOUR WORK WILL BE FOUND TO BE ONE OF ABSORBING INTEREST WORTHY OF THE WIDEST PATRONAGE AND HISTORICALLY VALUABLE AS PERTAINING TO THE TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE FOR THE ABOLITION OF CHATTEL SLAVERY IN OUR LAND
I SHALL DO FOR THEM AS YOU ALL DONE FOR ME WHEN I CAME ON HERE HOWEVER I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR THEM IF THEY CAN THEY SHALL DO IF THEY WILL DO BUT SOME COMES HERE THAT CAN'T DO WELL BECAUSE THEY MAKE NO EFFORD
HENRY BEING TWENTY-THREE
JAKE HOWEVER STOOD MORE IN AWE OF A YOUNG MASTER WHO WAS SOON LIKELY TO COME INTO POWER THAN HE DID OF THE OLD MASTER
ONLY A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HE ESCAPED HIS MASTER IN ONE OF HIS FITS OF PASSION FLOGGED HIM MOST CRUELLY
MY FRIEND I WANTS TO HEAR FROM VIRGINIA THE WORST OF ALL THINGS
OSCAR THE NEXT PASSENGER WAS ADVERTISED AS FOLLOWS
BUT THE FIERCE PASSIONS ENGENDERED BY SLAVERY IN THE SLAVEOWNER DETERMINED IT OTHERWISE
SCOTT BOUGHT ME FIRST FROM A YOUNG MAN HE MET ONE DAY IN THE ROAD WITH A BUNDLE IN HIS ARMS
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE EXAMINATIONS AND ARGUMENTS WOULD FILL VOLUMES AND WERE OF THE MOST DEEPLY INTERESTING NATURE
SAID JENNY I WAS SOLD AT THIS SETTLEMENT SALE AND BOUGHT IN BY THE GRASS WIDOW FOR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THE PLACE AND A NUMBER OF SLAVES WERE BOUGHT IN ON TERMS EQUALLY AS LOW
BE THOU MY GOOD AND SO THEY EXCHANGED LIGHT FOR DARKNESS AND FREEDOM FOR BONDAGE AND GOOD FOR EVIL AND IF YOU LIKE HEAVEN FOR HELL
THE LIGHTNING TRAIN WAS PUT ON THE ROAD ON LAST MONDAY AND AS THE TRAVELING SEASON HAS COMMENCED AND THIS IS THE SOUTHERN ROUTE FOR NIAGARA FALLS I HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO SEND BY WAY OF AUBURN EXCEPT IN CASES OF GREAT DANGER

FRANCES ELLEN WATKINS HARPER
IN THE SPRING OF 1865 HE WAS MADE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN FREEDMAN'S COMMISSION WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ESTABLISH AND TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK
I ARRIVED AT THE SHOE SHOP ON THE PLANTATION ONE O'CLOCK TUESDAY 28TH
AND THEN POOR CONCKLIN
WILL YOU COME DOWN TO BLOODGOOD'S HOTEL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE--AS THERE ARE THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES HERE AND THEY WANT LIBERTY
HERE WE HAVE IN COMPLETE DETAIL THE VARIOUS METHODS ADOPTED FOR CIRCUMVENTING THE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND TOLD AS IT IS WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY AND NATURAL FEELING THE NARRATIVE IS ONE WHICH CANNOT BUT MAKE A DEEP IMPRESSION
PLEASE REQUEST HER TO WRITE TO ME IMMEDIATELY FOR HER TO BE OF GOOD COURAGE THAT I LOVE HER BETTER THAN EVER
THE SAME WRITER SENT TO THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY THE FOLLOWING WARNING TO SLAVE-HOLDERS AT THE TIME THESE DOCUMENTS WERE RECEIVED SLAVEHOLDERS WERE NEVER MORE DEFIANT
BUT WE WISHED HALF OF THAT SUM TO BE LAID OUT AS ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION AT THY OWN DISCRETION IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
JOHN ACCUSED HIS MISTRESS OF BEING HARD IN MONEY MATTERS NOT CARING HOW THE SERVANTS FARED SO SHE GOT PLENTY OF MONEY OUT OF THEM FOR HIMSELF HOWEVER HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED AS GREAT ABUSES AS MANY HAD
HE TORE MY SHIRT OFF AFTER I WOULD NOT PULL IT OFF
IN NO DEGREE WHATEVER DID SHE THINK WELL OF SLAVERY
IN THIS KIND OF PROPERTY HOWEVER MRS COLLEY HAD NOT LARGELY INVESTED
IN THIS WAY THE CAPTAIN PUT OUT TO SEA
HATED A COLORED MAN TO HAVE ANY COMFORT IN THE WORLD
THAT THE SILENT PRAYERS OF THIS OPPRESSED YOUNG WOMAN TOGETHER WITH HER FAITHFUL PROTECTOR'S WERE MOMENTARILY ASCENDING TO THE EAR OF THE GOOD GOD ABOVE THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION
LAMBERT ELIZABETH AND THREE CHILDREN MARY HORACE AND WM
THIS SEPARATION CONSTITUTED HIS DAILY GRIEF AND WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS ESCAPE
THE PARTY WHOSE NARRATIVES ARE HERE GIVEN BROUGHT GRAVE CHARGES AGAINST A BACKSLIDING MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS--A RENEGADE QUAKER
WE ANSWER BY POLITICAL ACTION
BUT THE KIDNAPPERS HAD GOT THE START OF THEM
THE BIGGEST BOOK AMERICA HAS YET WRITTEN
AT ALL EVENTS NO WILL WAS FOUND
HE WAS NOT FREE HOWEVER FROM THE SAD THOUGHT OF HAVING LEFT HIS WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN IN THE PRISON HOUSE NOR OF THE FACT THAT HIS OWN DEAR MOTHER WAS BRUTALLY STABBED TO THE HEART WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE BY HER YOUNG MASTER WHILE HE PERRY WAS A BABE
IMMEDIATELY SHE TOOK THE FIRST PREREQUISITE STEP WHICH WAS TO REPAIR TO A PLACE OF CONCEALMENT WITH A FRIEND IN THE CITY AND THERE LIKE THE MAN AT THE POOL WAIT UNTIL HER TURN CAME TO BE CONVEYED THENCE TO A FREE STATE
LETTER FROM MISS G.A
IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE SAW NO OTHER WAY THAN BY SUBMITTING TO BE SECRETED UNTIL AN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD OFFER VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
OF COURSE THE TRADER KNEW QUITE WELL THAT AN ARTICLE OF HER APPEARANCE WOULD COMMAND READILY A VERY HIGH PRICE IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PRESENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CORRESPONDENCE IN THIS CASE TO BRING TO LIGHT THE HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF THIS NARRATIVE
INDEED THEY MADE QUITE A FUSS OVER HIM
HE BELONGED TO THE ESTATE OF THE LATE MRS SARAH TWYNE WHO BORE THE REPUTATION OF BEING A LADY OF WEALTH AND OWNED ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE SLAVES
BUT I SPOKE AT A HOUSE
FOR THREE YEARS I SUPERINTENDED A SABBATH-SCHOOL MOSTLY COMPOSED OF COLORED CHILDREN AND ADULTS
HE WAS THE LAST MAN TO REPRESENT AS NATURALLY OPPOSITE THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ALWAYS EVEN TO THE END OF THE WORLD MADE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT
FOR TWO YEARS PRIOR TO HER ESCAPE THE YOUNG TRADER HAD BEEN TRYING TO INFLUENCE HIS FATHER TO LET HIM HAVE HER FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET
THE MAJOR WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO RECOVER HIM AND HE WOULD GLADLY REWARD MR W
THE CHIVALRY OF THE SOUTH TAMELY ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE PLUCKED BY THE BEARD
THUS SAFELY ON THE BOAT THE MAN WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO PUT THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY IN THE MOST SAFE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PLACE IF HE SAW THAT EVERY THING LOOKED FAVORABLE WOULD QUICKLY ARRANGE MATTERS WITHOUT BEING MISSED FROM HIS DUTIES
READ SAID ANN
THE APPEARANCE AND AIR OF THIS YOUNG ASPIRANT FOR LIBERTY INDICATED THAT HE WAS NOT OF THE MATERIAL TO BE HELD IN CHAINS
BUT ON A FULLER INVESTIGATION THEY FOUND THAT HE REALLY BORE THE NAME AND MEANT TO RETAIN IT IN CANADA
FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS HIS ANCESTORS HAD BEEN MEMBERS OF THAT BODY AND HE INHERITED FROM THEM THE STRONG SENSE OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE LOVE OF TOLERATION AND RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS WHICH HAVE EVER CHARACTERIZED THAT BODY OF PEOPLE
THE NIGHT HE ARRIVED WAS VERY COLD
WHILE I WAS WITH THEM I WAS ELATED WITH JOY AT THEIR ESCAPE AND YET WHEN I HEARD THEIR TALE OF WOE ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE MOTHER I COULD NOT SUPPRESS TEARS OF DEEPEST EMOTION
IN PROCESS OF TIME THE ELDEST SON DESIRING TO MARRY DEBORAH HOOPES THE DAUGHTER OF DANIEL HOOPES OF A NEIGHBORING TOWNSHIP IN CHESTER COUNTY THE YOUNG PEOPLE OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF PARENTS AND FRIENDS BUT IT WAS A TIME OF GRIEF AND MOURNING AMONG YOUNG AND OLD

2D ITEM
NOW IF YOU PERSONALLY CAN GET WORD TO THEM AND GET THEM TO SEND HIM A LETTER IN MY CHARGE INFORMING HIM OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND PROSPECTS I THINK IT WILL BE THE BEST ANSWER I CAN MAKE HIM
HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WELL MADE QUITE BLACK INTELLIGENT AND SELF-POSSESSED IN HIS MANNER
IN FACT THE ONLY SERIOUS DIFFICULTY HE HAD TO SURMOUNT WAS TO FIND A CAPTAIN WITH WHOM HE COULD SECURE A SAFE PASSAGE NORTH
I JOIN VERY CORDIALLY IN THE PRECEDING STATEMENT AND RECOMMENDATION
IF HE LAYS STILL A DAY OR TWO ALL SUSPICION WILL BE PREVENTED
HE AND BEVERLY GOOD HIS COMRADE TENDER MUCH LOVE TO YOU
NOTWITHSTANDING HER BOLD AND DECIDED STAND THE REPORT WENT OUT THAT SHE WAS TO BE SOLD AND THAT ALL THE SLAVES WERE STILL TO BE HELD IN BONDAGE

TRUE HE HAD NOT BEEN FED VERY WELL ELIJAH HIS MASTER WAS AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE HEAD TALL AND STOUT AND THE OWNER OF FIFTEEN HEAD OF SLAVES
SLOWLY--FEARING THAT TOO MUCH INTEREST MANIFESTED MIGHT EXCITE SUSPICION--HE REPLIED
OF COURSE HE HAD VERY SAFELY CONCEALED ABOUT HIM VINA'S CAPE AND ONE OR TWO OTHER ARTICLES WHICH HE WAS TO USE FOR HIS IDENTIFICATION IN MEETING HER AND THE CHILDREN ON THE PLANTATION

PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT FOR EVERY INSPECTION OF A VESSEL ENGAGED IN THE COAL TRADE THE INSPECTOR SHALL NOT RECEIVE A GREATER SUM THAN TWO DOLLARS
TAKE THE FOLLOWING AS AN ILLUSTRATION
BUT FEW COULD BE FOUND AMONG THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS WHO HAD A STRONGER REPUGNANCE TO THE UNREQUITED LABOR SYSTEM OR THE RECOGNIZED TERMS OF MASTER AND SLAVE THAN DR THOMAS BAYNE
IT WAS HIS CONSTANT DESIRE TO DIFFUSE THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAD BEEN SO FEARLESSLY PROCLAIMED BY THE CONVENTION AND TO ENCOURAGE THE FORMATION OF ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT THE SPHERE OF HIS INFLUENCE
I HAVE BEEN LONGING TO HEAR SOME NEWS FROM THAT PART YOU MAY THINK OUT OF SIGHT AND OUT OF MIND BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU NO MATTER HOW FAR I MAY BE OR IN WHAT DISTANT LAND I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOU IF I CAN NEVER REACH YOU BY LETTERS YOU MAY BE SURE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE FOR YOU WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER AFTER THE FATIGUE OF TRAVEL THAN A THOROUGH BATH
HENRIETTA ALSO REMEMBERED THAT YEARS BEFORE HER MOTHER HAD ESCAPED AND GOT OFF TO CANADA WHICH WAS AN ADDITIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT
THE TIDE OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT CHANGED--HANAWAY AND THE OTHER TRAITORS BEGAN TO BE LOOKED UPON AS HAVING BEEN GREATLY INJURED AND JUSTLY ENTITLED TO PUBLIC SYMPATHY AND HONOR WHILE CONFUSION OF FACE DISAPPOINTMENT AND CHAGRIN WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE DEMORALIZED RANKS OF THE ENEMY

I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT
THE HEART-BROKEN MOTHER WAS SURROUNDED BY FIVE OF HER CHILDREN THREE OF WHOM WERE INFANTS
I BELIEVE I CAN TREAT MYSELF BETTER THAN HE CAN OR ANYBODY ELSE FOR THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT SOMETIMES AS WAITER SOMETIMES IN A TOBACCO FACTORY AND FOR FIVE YEARS IN THE COAL MINES
I THINK HIM MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN
TABBY AND ELIZA FORTLOCK SISTERS AND SINGLE WOMEN HAD BEEN DERIVING YEARS OF LEISURE COMFORT AND MONEY FROM THE SWEAT OF EDWARD'S BROW
AT LEAST I COULD MINE AND THE WATER FROZE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TUMBLER
AS HE HAD ENDURED SEVERE HARDSHIP UNDER HIS OLD MASTER JOHN MALDON HE WAS UNWILLING TO TRY ANOTHER
I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR SOME ONE FROM THE OLD SOD FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT I WAS IN GOOD HOPES THAT IT WOULD BE MY POOR UNCLE
FOR THE LAST EIGHT OR TEN YEARS PREVIOUS TO HIS ESCAPE HE HAD NOT SEEN HIS RELATIVES HIS FATHER GEORGE WRIGHT HAVING FLED TO CANADA AND THE REMAINDER OF THE FAMILY LIVED SOME FIFTY MILES DISTANT BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERCOURSE
IF I HAD HAD PAPER MONEY AS MCKIM DESIRED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

AT LEAST NONE THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND FOR NINE LONG MONTHS HAD THAT POOR GIRL BEEN CONFINED IN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE COOK'S CHAMBER WATCHED OVER DAY AND NIGHT BY THAT FAITHFUL FRIEND WITH A VIGILANCE AS SLEEPLESS AS IT WAS DISINTERESTED

AS TO THE COLORED MAN ADAMS THE PROSPECT LOOKED SIMPLY HOPELESS
CHARLES EXPERIENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HIS OLD HOME LEFT NO GROUND FOR HIM TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND FRIENDLY AID ANYWHERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF SLAVERY
THAT IS SAD
MR HAINES KNEW RACHEL AND SEEING MCCREARY THERE AND HER SO OVERWHELMED IN SORROW AT ONCE GUESSED THE SITUATION OF AFFAIRS AND HE AND WILEY CHANGED THEIR INTENTIONS OF GOING TO PHILADELPHIA AND WENT IN THE SAME CAR WITH MCCREARY AND HIS VICTIM TO BALTIMORE AND QUIETLY WATCHED WHAT DISPOSITION WOULD BE MADE OF HER AS THEY FELT CERTAIN PURSUIT WOULD BE MADE
THEY ALL WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO GET THEIR TIME BUT WANT TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE JUST AT THIS POINT OF THE INTERVIEW THE HOUR OF MIDNIGHT ADMONISHED US THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE

I FOUND ALL THINGS HERE AS PETER TOLD ME EXCEPT THE DISTANCE OF THE RIVER
IN THIS HOT-BED OF SLAVERY HE LABORED AND SUFFERED UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY-TWO
THERE SELFISHNESS AND BRUTALITY HOLD CARNIVAL TILL IT SEEMS AS THOUGH JUSTICE HAD BEEN EXILED AND GOD HAD FORGOTTEN HIS OWN
I SUFFERED MIGHTY BAD WITH THE COLD AND FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
HOW WHEN THIS END WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH AN EARNEST PURPOSE HE TOOK HIS CARPET-BAG IN HIS HAND AND HIS HEART THROBBING FOR HIS OLD HOME AND PEOPLE HE TURNED HIS MIND VERY PRIVATELY TOWARDS PHILADELPHIA WHERE HE HOPED BY HAVING NOTICES READ IN THE COLORED CHURCHES TO THE EFFECT THAT FORTY-ONE OR FORTY-TWO YEARS BEFORE TWO LITTLE BOYS[A WERE KIDNAPPED AND CARRIED SOUTH"--THAT THE MEMORY OF SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS MIGHT RECALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN THIS WAY HE WOULD BE AIDED IN HIS ARDENT EFFORTS TO BECOME RESTORED TO THEM
MILLER COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE OF HIS BEING IMPLICATED IN THE KIDNAPPING IS A BASE FABRICATION

CHARLES HOWEVER HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THE FLOOR ACCOMMODATIONS
THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE CHARLES AND MARGARET HAD LIVED AND BREATHED AND HAD THEIR EXISTENCE WAS HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH SLAVERY
HOW IT WAS DONE AND THE RESULTS TAKEN FROM THE OLD LIBERATOR WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON'S ORGAN WE COPY AS FOLLOWS
JOHN HOWEVER HAD NOT ONLY OBSERVED SLAVERY FROM A DOMESTIC STAND-POINT HE HAD ALSO WATCHED MASTER AND MISTRESS ABROAD AS VISITORS AND GUESTS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES NOTICED NOT ONLY HOW THEY TREATED WHITE PEOPLE BUT ALSO HOW THEY TREATED BLACK PEOPLE
JUSTICE TO-DAY ASSERTS HER CLAIM AND FROM THY BROW FADES OUT THE BAN

ONE OF THE OLD TIME FELLOWS VERY HARD AND RASH--NOT FIT TO OWN A DOG HE OWNED TWELVE SLAVES
IN LEAVING HE HAD TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS THREE BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS
THAT AT THE TIME THEY ALLEGE HER TO HAVE BEEN IN MARYLAND ON THE PLANTATION OF DR PURNELL SHE WAS IN CHESTER COUNTY AND IN THE YEAR LAFAYETTE VISITED THIS COUNTRY SHE WAS IN THIS CITY
DESPAIR WAS DEPICTED ON ALL FACES SYMPATHIZING WITH THE PURSUERS
IT WAS SAD TO SEE SUCH PERSONS DESTITUTE AND HOMELESS COMPELLED TO SEEK REFUGE AMONG STRANGERS NOT DARING TO ASK THE SLIGHTEST FAVOR SYMPATHY OR PRAYER TO AID HER CHRISTIAN AS SHE WAS FROM ANY CHRISTIAN OF BALTIMORE WEARING A FAIR SKIN
WHILE THE COMMITTEE LISTENED TO HIS NARRATIONS WITH MUCH INTEREST THEY ONLY TOOK NOTE OF HOW HE HAD FARED AND THE CHARACTER OF THE MASTER HE WAS COMPELLED TO SERVE
THROUGH THE MONEY I RECEIVED FROM YOU AND OTHER FRIENDS IN THIS COUNTRY I WAS MOVING THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM IN ALL PARTS OF KENTUCKY

THE MOB HAD COLLECTED AND ORGANIZED TO THE NUMBER OF SEVERAL HUNDRED AND WERE MARCHING THROUGH THE LOWER PART OF THE CITY DEALING DESTRUCTION IN THEIR COURSE
TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION THEY MOVED OVER SCHUYLKILL ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO
IN THIS CONNECTION HE RECALLED THE FACT OF RICHARDSON'S BEING A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH AND IN A SARCASTIC MANNER ADDED THAT HIS RELIGIOUS PRETENSIONS MIGHT PASS AMONG SLAVE-HOLDERS BUT THAT IT WOULD DO HIM NO GOOD WHEN MEETING THE JUDGE ABOVE BEING SATISFIED THAT HE WOULD THERE MEET HIS DESERTS ROBERT TOOK A DEGREE OF COMFORT THEREFROM

HE HAD SEEN MUCH OF THE CRUELTIES OF SLAVERY INFLICTED UPON OTHERS IN VARIOUS FORMS WHICH HE RELATED IN A WAY TO MAKE ONE SHUDDER
DAVID THE HUSBAND HAD BEEN IN BONDS UNDER CAPTAIN JAMES TAYLOR
IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN CAME TO MY OFFICE
EVEN WHILST THE SOUTHERN SLAVE-HOLDERS WERE SEEKING MY DESTRUCTION I NEVER FOR A MOMENT ENTERTAINED ANY OTHER FEELING TOWARD THEM THAN AN EARNEST DESIRE UNDER GOD TO DELIVER THEM FROM A DEADLY CURSE AND AN AWFUL SIN
THE PLACE THAT HE FLED FROM WAS CALLED NORTH POINT BALTIMORE COUNTY
THROUGH HIS HOMELY FEATURES AND HUMBLE GARB THE INTREPIDITY OF SOUL CAME OUT IN ALL ITS LUSTRE
JUDGE BOOTH RESPONDED CERTAINLY NOT
DAVID STORMON ESTIMATES THE EXPENSES FROM HIS HOUSE TO CANADA AT FORTY DOLLARS WITHOUT WHICH NO SURE PROTECTION WILL BE GIVEN
HE EVIDENTLY HAD BLOOD IN HIS VEINS WHICH DECIDEDLY WARRED AGAINST SUBMITTING TO THE YOKE
SELF-DELUSION ON THE SUBJECT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE
THEREFORE WAS HE A FRIEND OF TEMPERANCE OF OPPRESSED AND NEEDY WORKING-MEN AND WOMEN WORLD-WIDE IN THE SCOPE OF HIS PHILANTHROPIC SYMPATHY AND BROADLY CATHOLIC AND COMPREHENSIVE IN HIS VIEWS OF RELIGIOUS LIFE AND DUTY
THE SOLITARY PERSON MRS GRAVES HAS ALSO BEEN ATTENDED TO
ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS NOT CHARLES INTENTION TO LET ANY OFFER SLIDE
I DESIRE TO SEE HER FITTED FOR THE POST OF TEACHER
BARLOW ARCHER ALIAS EMIT ROBINS 203
AMONG THESE WERE A MAN AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR FOUR CHILDREN NOTICED ELSEWHERE FROM MARYLAND
DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE EVENING THE WRITER WITH A BELL IN HAND PASSED UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER IN QUEST OF THE STRANGER BUT NO ONE COULD GIVE ANY INFORMATION OF HIM
AND AS FOR RESULT THIS LONELY AND SOLEMN RALLY ON THE DEEPEST WITHIN US AS IT IS CONTINUOUSLY UNFOLDED MUST LEAD TO A GLAD AND SOLEMN UNION WITH THE HIGHEST WITHOUT US
THE DANGERS FROM OTHER SOURCES PRESENTED ALSO A FRIGHTFUL ASPECT
IT HAS STRUCK ME OF LATE THAT IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO PRINT OCCASIONAL EXTRACTS FROM THY LETTERS WITH OTHER ANTI-SLAVERY INFORMATION IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE THE OBTAINING OF PECUNIARY AID
IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS FOUR ARRIVALS HAD COME TO HAND FROM DIFFERENT LOCALITIES
DURING THE BEST PORTION OF HIS DAYS HE HAD FAITHFULLY WORN THE BADGE OF SLAVERY HAD AFTERWARDS PURCHASED HIS FREEDOM AND THUS BECOME A FREE MAN
WE HAVE SO MANY COMING TO US WE THINK IT BEST FOR SOME OF THEM TO PASS ON TO OTHER PLACES
FOR A YOUNG MAN BEING ONLY TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD BEEN KEPT FROM THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM AS MUCH AS HE HAD HIS STORY WAS THOUGHT TO BE EXCEEDINGLY WELL TOLD THROUGHOUT
I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR HER BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE AND BEG OF YOU TO DEVISE SOME MEANS TO GET HER AWAY
JUST AS THEY SUPPOSED THEY HAD ACHIEVED A VICTORY THEY WERE OBLIGED WITH FALLEN CRESTS TO SUCCUMB TO THE DICTATES OF A HIGHER TRIBUNAL AND TO SEE THEIR VICTIM CONVEYED BEYOND THEIR REACH IN THE SAFE KEEPING OF THE SHERIFF
WE LIKE TO SEE SUCH LETTERS
HERE IT MAY BE REMARKED WITH REFERENCE TO MARRYING THAT OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF FUGITIVES IN CANADA THE MALE SEX WAS LARGELY IN PREPONDERANCE OVER THE FEMALE AND MANY OF THEM WERE SINGLE YOUNG MEN
SHE PERMITTED HIM TO HIRE HIS TIME FIND HIS OWN CLOTHING ETC BY WHICH REGULATION JOE GOT ALONG SMOOTHLY
TIME AND AGAIN SHE MADE SUCCESSFUL VISITS TO MARYLAND ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND WOULD BE ABSENT FOR WEEKS AT A TIME RUNNING DAILY RISKS WHILE MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR HERSELF AND PASSENGERS
I HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP IN AN OHIO COLLEGE GENEVA HALL WHICH WILL ENTITLE ME--ANY ONE I MAY SEND--TO SIX YEARS TUITION
THE ROAD WAS DOING A FLOURISHING BUSINESS DURING THE SHORT TIME THAT THIS STATION RECEIVED AID AND SYMPATHY FROM THE LADIES ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY OF ELLINGTON AND LITTLE DID WE DREAM THAT ITS EXISTENCE WOULD SO SOON BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID BY THE UTTER OVERTHROW OF SLAVERY
HE LEFT HOME ON CHRISTMAS DAY ONE YEAR SINCE WANDERED ABOUT THE FORESTS OF NORTH CAROLINA FOR ABOUT TEN MONTHS AND THEN CAME HERE WITH THOSE FORWARDED TO NEW BEDFORD WHERE HE IS ANXIOUS TO GO
THE EXILES ARE CONSEQUENTLY STILL IN OHIO OR WANDERING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF EMPLOYMENT
AND WHAT IS THY OPINION
I HAVE SEEN FIVE
NO SIGN OF ANY OTHER VESSEL WAS THEN IN SIGHT
ON THE CONTRARY SHE REPRESENTED A YOUNG LADY WITH A PASSABLE EDUCATION AND VERY REFINED IN HER DEPORTMENT
TO MAKE EVEN THE MOST UNPRETENDING BOOK FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HOME WITHOUT BRINGING FORWARD THE NAME OF ISAAC T
ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--THINE WAS RECEIVED YESTERDAY
SINCE HIS RETURN TO THIS COUNTY SUSPICION HAS FASTENED UPON HIM AS GIVING AID AND ASSISTING SLAVES WHO HAVE SINCE ABSCONDED AND REACHED CANADA AND SEVERAL WEEKS AGO A PARTY OF GENTLEMEN FROM NEW MARKET DISTRICT WENT AT NIGHT TO GREEN'S HOUSE AND MADE SEARCH WHEREUPON WAS FOUND A VOLUME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN A MAP OF CANADA SEVERAL SCHEDULES OF ROUTES TO THE NORTH AND A LETTER FROM HIS SON IN CANADA DETAILING THE PLEASANT TRIP HE HAD THE NUMBER OF FRIENDS HE MET WITH ON THE WAY WITH PLENTY TO EAT DRINK ETC AND CONCLUDES WITH A REQUEST TO HIS FATHER THAT HE SHALL TELL CERTAIN OTHER SLAVES NAMING THEM TO COME ON WHICH SLAVES IT IS WELL KNOWN DID LEAVE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND HAVE REACHED CANADA
KIRK AND ABNER RICHARDSON SHOULD RETURN FROM PERRYVILLE IN THE NEXT TRAIN AND PROSECUTE FURTHER SEARCH FOR MILLER

LIBERTY OR DEATH
FOR A FORTNIGHT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER PRAYERS WERE TO BE ANSWERED FOR CORDELIA APPARENTLY BORE HERSELF AS SUBMISSIVELY AS EVER AND MADAME RECEIVED CALLS AND ACCEPTED INVITATIONS FROM SOME OF THE ELITE OF THE CITY WITHOUT SUSPECTING ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF CORDELIA TO ESCAPE
OWEN WAS ABOUT THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE BUT HAD EXPERIENCED A DEAL OF TROUBLE
I ACKNOWLEDGE MY GREAT NEGLECTNESS OF YOU WITH GREAT REGRET THAT I HAVE NOT ANSWERED YOUR LETTER BEFORE THIS I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME AS I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ME A WIFE SINCE I WROTE TO YOU LAST
THE OWNER HIRED HER OUT TO A MAN BY THE NAME OF GREEN FROM WHOM HE RECEIVED SEVENTY DOLLARS PER ANNUM
THEY WERE ALL YOUNG AND HOPEFUL AND BELONGED TO THE MORE INTELLIGENT AND PROMISING OF THEIR RACE
IT BESTOWED POLITICAL OFFICES AND HONORS AND WAS THEREBY ENABLED TO COMMAND THE APOSTATE HOMAGE OF POLITICAL AMBITION
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A PASSAGE ON A STEAMER WAS BEFORE HER TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME
HE RELATED THE WHOLE STORY TO ME AS HE HAD IT FROM FRIEND CONCKLIN AND THE MOTHER AND CHILDREN AND THEN THE STORY OF THEIR CAPTURE
IF SO YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO PROMISE IT TO ANY ONE WHOM YOU THINK I WOULD BE WILLING TO EDUCATE
HE SEEMED BORN TO SHOW HOW GREAT STRICTNESS IN ESSENTIALS COULD EXIST WITHOUT THE LEAST ASCETICISM IN TRIFLES
FROM WILLIAM WRIGHT'S HE WENT TO DANIEL GIBBONS THENCE TO DELAWARE COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA AND FROM THERE TO NEW HAVEN CONN WHERE WHILE PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF JANITOR AT YALE COLLEGE HE COMPLETED THE STUDIES OF THE COLLEGE COURSE
STILL:--_DEAR FRIEND_--THY LETTER OF 1ST INST CAME DULY TO HAND BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GIVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR FRIEND CONCKLIN I THOUGHT BEST TO WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE I WROTE STILL HOPING TO LEARN SOMETHING MORE DEFINITE CONCERNING HIM
THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION CONCERNING THE SHOCKING AFFAIR WHICH OCCURRED AT CHRISTIANA ON THURSDAY THE RESISTING OF A LAW OF CONGRESS BY A BAND OF ARMED NEGROES WHEREBY THE MAJESTY OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS DEFIED AND LIFE TAKEN IN ONE AND THE SAME ACT
FINDING THEMSELVES WORSTED AT EVERY POINT THEY WERE COMPELLED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO LYING AND UNBLUSHINGLY DENIED THAT THE BILL CONTAINED THE PROVISIONS WHICH CRAFT ALLEGED IT DID
DEAR SIR:--I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING YOU THESE FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I AM WELL AND HOPE THESE FEW LINES WILL FIND YOU THE SAME AND YOUR FAMILY YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WRITING TO YOU BEFORE

THE COMING OF THESE PASSENGERS WAS HERALDED BY THOMAS GARRETT AS FOLLOWS

IN OTHER WORDS SHE HAD THREATENED TO SELL HIM

HE FOLLOWED FARMING
HE WAS LIVING IN 1841
SHE WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF ALLOWING THE SLAVES ANY CHANCE AT ALL ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA 1860
HE WAS TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WHEN HE FIRST LANDED IN PHILADELPHIA IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1860 PER STEAMER PENNSYLVANIA IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN STOWED AWAY IN A STORE-ROOM CONTAINING A LOT OF RUBBISH AND FURNITURE
HE HAD THEREFORE PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT ELLICOTT'S MILLS WAS A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A COLORED MAN WHO WANTED HIS FREEDOM AND THAT ALL MARYLAND WAS NO BETTER
THEY REACHED THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK A.M
THE HIGHEST OR AT LEAST THE DIRECT PROOF OF THE COMBINATION MAY BE FOUND IN THE DECLARED PURPOSES OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY BEFORE THE ACTUAL OUTBREAK
HE HAD ENJOYED AS FAR AS IT WAS EXPECTED FOR A SLAVE TO DO FIVE MONTHS OF MARRIED LIFE BUT HE LOVED SLAVERY NO LESS ON THIS ACCOUNT
ONE MAN FOUND SEVERAL SHOT IN HIS BOOT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE SPENT THEIR FORCE BEFORE REACHING HIM AND DID NOT EVEN BREAK THE SKIN

THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER SAW BURRIS AND ALSO THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD EVER BEEN CALLED UPON TO ASSIST FUGITIVES FROM THE HELL OF AMERICAN SLAVERY
ONE OF THEM SEIZED THE CHAIN OF THE FUGITIVES BOAT AND PEREMPTORILY CLAIMED IT
HE TREATED HIS WIFE VERY BAD TOO
SHE IS SMART BUT CANNOT BUNG MY EYE SO SHE SHALL HAVE TO DIE IN THE POOR HOUSE AT LAST SO SHE SAYS AND MERCER AND MYSELF WILL BE THE CAUSE OF IT

MY DEAR FRIEND:--I RECEAVED YOURS DATED THE 10TH AND THE PAPERS ON THE 13TH I ALSO SAW THE PICE THAT WAS IN MISS SHADD'S PAPER ABOUT ME
WE HAVE THEM ALL SECURE
THOMAS AN OLDER COMPANION OF PHILIP AND RANDOLPH WAS TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE FULL BLACK AND LOOKED AS IF HE COULD APPRECIATE THE SCHOOLROOM AND BOOKS AND TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF IN CANADA OR ANY OTHER FREE COUNTRY
FOR FIVE YEARS HE LIVED IN BOSTON AND RAN ON A BOAT TRADING TO CANADA EAST
THE OLD MAN WAS SMART FOR HIS YEARS BUT BORE EVIDENCE THAT MUCH HARD LABOR HAD BEEN WRUNG OUT OF HIM BY SLAVERY
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
THIS FRIEND'S OPPORTUNITIES OF WITNESSING FRESH ARRIVALS HAD BEEN RARE AND PERHAPS SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH A CHATTEL SO SMART AS SAM CONSEQUENTLY SHE WAS MUCH EMBARRASSED WHEN SHE HEARD HIS STORY ESPECIALLY WHEN HE TALKED OF HIS EXPERIENCE AS A DENTIST SHE WAS INCLINED TO SUSPECT THAT HE WAS A SHREWD IMPOSTOR THAT NEEDED WATCHING INSTEAD OF AIDING
I MUST NOW PASS TO A THIRD ADVENTURER
VERENEA WAS ABOUT FORTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK CHESTNUT COLOR PREPOSSESSING IN MANNERS INTELLIGENT AND REFINED
BECOMING SOMEWHAT SATISFACTORILY SITUATED HE SENT FOR HIS FAMILY WHO JOINED HIM
ON A LATE OCCASION WHEN ISAAC WAS BEING CHUNKED BEYOND MEASURE HE RESISTED BUT THE PERSISTENT BLACKSMITH DID NOT YIELD UNTIL HE HAD SO FAR DISABLED ISAAC THAT HE WAS RENDERED HELPLESS FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
THEY THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE OF PENNSYLVANIA TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE NECESSITY OF VINDICATING THE OUTRAGED LAWS AND SUSTAINING THE DIGNITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH ON THIS IMPORTANT AND MELANCHOLY OCCASION UNDER THIS HIGH PRESSURE OF PUBLIC EXCITEMENT THREATENING AND ALARM BREATHED SO FREELY ON EVERY HAND THAT FUGITIVE SLAVES AND THEIR FRIENDS IN THIS REGION OF PENNSYLVANIA AT LEAST WERE COMPELLED TO PASS THROUGH AN HOUR OF DREADFUL DARKNESS--AN ORDEAL EXTREMELY TRYING

BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS TO THE AUTHOR BY PROMINENT MEN
HE CONFESSED HOWEVER THAT FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE HE HAD FEIGNED SICKNESS,--TOLD HIS MASTER THAT HE WAS SICK ALL OVER TEN TIMES A DAY HANSON SAID THEY WOULD ASK HIM HOW HE WAS BUT WAS NOT WILLING TO MAKE HIS TASK MUCH LIGHTER THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION WAS GIVEN OF HIS MASTER AND HIS REASON FOR LEAVING HIM
HE WAS FULLY POSTED FROM A TO Z BUT IN HIS OWN PERSON HE HAD BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO ESCAPE MOST OF THE MORE BRUTAL OUTRAGES
ON THE STRENGTH OF THE INFORMATION THUS OBTAINED A WELL-KNOWN COLORED MAN NAMED ADAMS WAS STRAIGHTWAY ARRESTED AND PUT IN PRISON AT THE INSTANCE OF ONE OF THE OWNERS AND ALSO A SUIT WAS AT THE SAME TIME INSTITUTED AGAINST THE RAIL ROAD COMPANY FOR DAMAGES--BY WHICH STEPS QUITE A HUGE EXCITEMENT WAS CREATED IN BALTIMORE
JAMES WAS CERTAINLY JUSTIFIABLE IN MAKING HIS ESCAPE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN ON THE SCORE OF BEING NEARLY RELATED TO THE CHIVALRY OF THE SOUTH
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP DEVOTION AND LIBERALITY WERE FELT IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL STATIONS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SLAVERY HARD A VERY DISSIPATED LIFE TO LIVE
WE HAVE HAD THIRTY-ONE FUGITIVES IN THE LAST TWENTY-SEVEN DAYS
THEY COULD DO NOTHING MORE THAN MAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF THE PERIL AS BEST THEY COULD
A27-6T WITH HIS FELLOW-PASSENGERS GEORGE AND THOMAS HE GREATLY ENJOYED THE HOSPITALITIES OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE AND HAD A VERY HIGH IDEA OF CANADA AS HE ANTICIPATED BECOMING A BRITISH SUBJECT AT AN EARLY DAY

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN HELD IN SUCH UNPLEASANT RELATIONS RANDOLPH HELD THE OPINION THAT SHE WAS A TOLERABLE GOOD WOMAN HE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT UNDER ISAAC HOWARD A FARMER WHO WAS DESCRIBED BY RANDOLPH AS A ROUGH MAN TO EVERYBODY AROUND HIM
THIS CERTAINLY IS A LIKELY-LOOKING PARTY ARE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH GREET THE EYE ON TURNING TO THE RECORD UNDER WHICH THEIR BRIEF NARRATIVES WERE ENTERED AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION SEPTEMBER 7TH 1857
NEW BEDFORD AUGUST 22D 1855
SINCE THE GREAT LAW WAS ENACTED WHICH MADE ALL MEN BLACK OR WHITE EQUAL IN POLITICAL RIGHTS--AS THEY WERE ALWAYS EQUAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD--MRS MOTT HAS MADE IT HER BUSINESS TO VISIT EVERY COLORED CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA
THE YOUNG WOMEN WERE VERY SICK AND THE MEN WERE TRIED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY
WHITE SUSAN BROOKS AND WM
OF COURSE HE WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE FACT ALSO THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO BE SOLD ANY DAY
ARRIVAL 1ST
ARRIVAL 1ST
THE CONDITION OF OUR PEOPLE THE WANTS OF OUR CHILDREN AND THE WELFARE OF OUR RACE DEMAND THE AID OF EVERY HELPING HAND THE GOD-SPEED OF EVERY CHRISTIAN HEART
BUT AS TOM WAS SATISFIED THAT HE COULD GET NO JUSTICE THROUGH THE MARYLAND COURTS AND KNEW THAT AN OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS MASTER HAD ALREADY PROCLAIMED THAT NEGROES HAD NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN ARE BOUND TO RESPECT ALSO AS HIS EXPERIENCE TENDED TO CONFIRM HIM IN THE BELIEF THAT THE IDEA WAS PRACTICALLY CARRIED OUT IN THE COURTS OF MARYLAND
I WAS A BRICKLAYER BY TRADE AND RANKED AMONG THE FIRST IN THE CITY AS HARRISON TALKED SO INTELLIGENTLY THE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WHO WAS EXAMINING HIM WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW HE CAME TO BE SO KNOWING THE FACT THAT HE COULD READ BEING VERY EVIDENT
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS A STRANGER AND THERE WAS CAUSE FOR GREAT CAUTIOUSNESS
IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS PUNISHMENT HE ESCAPED TO THE WOODS ETC
BEFORE ESCAPING THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED DIFFICULTIES OF THE MOST TRYING NATURE
GEORGE S
HE CAME TO THE COMMITTEE HUNGRY AND IN WANT OF CLOTHING AND WAS AIDED IN THE USUAL WAY
WHILST IN ATTACKING SLAVERY AT ITS HEAD-QUARTERS IN THE UNITED STATES MR GARRISON HAD TO ENCOUNTER THE FIERCEST PASSIONS WHICH COULD BE ROUSED
ORDINARY MODES OF TRAVEL HE CONCLUDED MIGHT PROVE DISASTROUS TO HIS HOPES
GREGG
WHEN THEY HAD CROSSED THIS BRIDGE THEY COULD LOOK BACK OVER ITS BROAD SILVERY STREAM ON ITS WESTERN SHORE AND SAY TO THE SLAVE POWER
BUT AS HE MOSES WAS THOROUGHLY TIRED AND BELIEVED THAT SLAVERY WAS NO MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN MURDER HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE AND JOIN THE UNION PARTY FOR CANADA
IT FORTUNATELY HAPPENED THAT A FRIEND WAS JUST ABOUT LEAVING FOR NEWARK IN HIS OWN CONVEYANCE AND FEELING AN INTEREST IN THE CASE HE KINDLY INVITED FRIEND SHIPLEY TO ACCOMPANY HIM
SOON THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED
THUS UNTIL THE LAST FETTER WAS BROKEN WITH SINGULAR PERSISTENCY ZEAL FAITH AND LABOR SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD TO AID THE SLAVE WITHOUT HOPE OF REWARD IN THIS WORLD
THERE ARE NO PEOPLE THAT NEED ALL THE BENEFITS RESULTING FROM A WELL-DIRECTED EDUCATION MORE THAN WE DO
NOTHING MORE AT PRESENT ONLY I STILL REMAIN IN HAMILTON C.W
MY MISTRESS MRS MARY F

I CANNOT SEE WHY LITTLE UNITED PARTIES SHOULD NOT PROMPTLY EMIGRATE UNDER THE WING OF THESE GENTLEMEN
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD WRITTEN TO MY WIFE TEN THOUSAND THANKS FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO DO
HE WAS A PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION WHICH ASSEMBLED IN THIS CITY IN 1833 AND A SIGNER OF THEIR DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS
HE THOUGHT OVER HIS SITUATION A GREAT DEAL AND FINALLY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE MUST GET FROM UNDER THE YOKE IF POSSIBLE BEFORE ENTERING ANOTHER NEW YEAR
AND BRING THE MISTRESS BEFORE THE COURT WHERE SHE WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF PENNSYLVANIA TO SHOW CAUSE WHY SHE RESTRAINED THIS WOMAN OF HER FREEDOM CORDELIA CONCLUDED TO ADOPT THE FORMER EXPEDIENT PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE WOULD PROTECT HER
HOPPER ISAAC T 740-745
WHEN I COME IF NOTHING PREVENTS I WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THEM
FROM THE PRISON COMES FORTH A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH OVER THAT POWER WHOSE ETHICS ARE ROBBERY OF THE FEEBLE AND OPPRESSION OF THE WEAK THE TROPHIES OF WHOSE CHIVALRY ARE A PLUNDERED CRADLE AND A SCOURGED AND BLEEDING WOMAN
CAN YOU TELL ME
NOTHING AT ALL OF THE KIND
IT WAS FORWARDED TO THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY TO BE SENT TO HER BUT NO OPPORTUNITY WAS AFFORDED SO TO DO SAFELY
NO PERMISSION HAD BEEN ASKED OF ANY OFFICER OF THE BOAT
WILLIAM WOODEN ALIAS WILLIAM NELSON
DR PURNELL DIED IN 1844 I FEEL CERTAIN
LEAVING THE WOODS HE PROCEEDED TO THE WASH-HOUSE AND WAS KINDLY RECEIVED BY ISABELLA BUT WHAT TO DO WITH HIM OR HOW TO AFFORD HIM ANY PROTECTION SHE COULD SEE NO WAY WHATEVER
THERE IS NO CHILD BUT MYSELF WERE NOT YOUR PARENTS KIND TO YOU AND DID YOU NOT LOVE THEM YES I LOVE THEM VERY MUCH HOW WERE YOU TREATED BY YOUR MASTER AND MISTRESS THEY TREATED ME VERY WELL HOW THEN SAID I COULD YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE CARE OF THAT SAILOR WHO WAS A STRANGER TO YOU AND LEAVE YOUR PARENTS I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER HEART-FELT REPLY

MOSES HAD NO SPECIAL FAULT TO FIND WITH HIS MASTER EXCEPT SUCH AS HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO BUT AS TO MISTRESS BRISCOE HE SAID THAT SHE WAS PRETTY ROUGH
I RUN ONLY TO HAVE LITTLE MORE TIME TO BREATHE BEFORE GOING TO GEORGIA OR NEW ORLEANS
FROM HIM LEWIS HAD RECEIVED VERY SEVERE FLOGGINGS THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HE WOULD NOT ONLY CARRY WITH HIM TO CANADA BUT TO THE GRAVE
THOSE WHO HAD MONEY CONTRIBUTED IT FREELY AND THOSE WHO WERE DESTITUTE OF MONEY GAVE THEIR TIME SAYING WITH THE APOSTLE
FROM 1828 UP TO THE DAY HE WAS INCARCERATED MANY HAD SOUGHT HIS AID AND COUNSEL NOR HAD THEY SOUGHT IN VAIN
YOU SIMPLY SAY THAT THE DOCTOR IS A TRUE MAN WHICH I CANNOT DOUBT THAT YOU THOUGHT IT BEST WE SHOULD HAVE AN INTERVIEW AND THAT YOU SUPPOSED I WOULD MEET THE EXPENSES
LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION WERE GIVEN HIM AND HE WAS DULY FORWARDED ON HIS WAY
LETTER FROM SHERIDAN FORD IN DISTRESS
FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR GERMAN CITIZENS IT MAY BE SAID THAT SLAVE-HOLDERS WITHIN THEIR RANKS WERE VERY FEW
HE WAS RATHER OF A BROWN COLOR WITH MARKED INTELLECTUAL FEATURES
AND A NUMBER OF CASES HAVE OCCURRED OF MURDERS FOR WHICH THE PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN VERY LAX OR NOT AT ALL AND IT MAY BE NEVER WILL BE
IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE SHE HAS BEEN EVER ACTIVE BELIEVING IN THE ULTRA NON-RESISTANCE GROUND THAT NO CHRISTIAN CAN CONSISTENTLY UPHOLD AND ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN AND SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE SWORD YET THIS WE BELIEVE DID NOT PREVENT HER FROM TAKING A PROFOUND INTEREST IN THE GREAT WAR FOR THE UNION

HENCE OCCASIONAL LETTERS RECEIVED FROM CANADA EVINCING MARKED PROGRESS SUCH AS THE HERO JOHN H
AFTER TAKING HIS SEAT ADDRESSES WERE MADE BY THE REV
HIS COUNTENANCE AND HIS MOVEMENTS SOON CONVINCED THE WONDERING SPECTATORS THAT HE WAS THE BEARER OF GRATIFYING NEWS AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE MYSTERY OF HIS ABSENCE WAS REVEALED BY THE PRODUCTION OF A DOCUMENT WHICH WAS THE FRUIT OF HIS EFFORT
BUT LEWIS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS TO PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY JUDGING FROM THE MANNER THAT THE SLAVES WERE TREATED BY BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
HIS EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF PETER'S
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY HIS MASTER PARTICULARLY AS HE WAS ALLOWED NO CHOICE ABOUT LIVING AS HE DESIRED THIS WAS INDEED ILL-TREATMENT AS JOHN VIEWED THE MATTER
A FEW WORDS MUST BE SAID WHERE A VOLUME WOULD SCARCELY SUFFICE
BUT HE HAD BEEN TRUSTING THE WORD OF A SLAVE-HOLDER WHO HAD PROBABLY ADOPTED THIS PLAN SIMPLY WITH A VIEW OF DRAWING MORE WILLING TOIL OUT OF HIM THAN HE COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY
DR FURNESS CAME INTO THE CAUSE WHEN IT WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND HAD FEW ADHERENTS
FOR THESE COMFORTS THEY WERE COMPELLED TO DO OVER-WORK OF NIGHTS
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS HE HAS RESIDED AT NEW BRUNSWICK NEW JERSEY ALTHOUGH HIS PROPERTY AND BUSINESS CONFINE HIM MAINLY TO HIS NATIVE STATE PENNSYLVANIA
WHILE THE VERBAL INTERCHANGE OF VIEWS WAS QUITE FULL THE HOUR FOR THE STARTING OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TRAIN ARRIVED TOO SOON TO ADMIT OF A FULL REPORT FOR THE RECORD BOOK
IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT IT REQUIRED SOME CONSIDERABLE NERVE FOR A FREE MAN EVEN TO JOIN HIS WIFE IN AN EFFORT OF THIS CHARACTER
NO WONDER THAT PROFESSING TO LOVE CHRIST AND HIS RELIGION WE DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR THEM SPOKEN OF
TO QUOTE THE WORDS OF WEBSTER WE TURNED AND PAUSED AND JOINED OUR VOICES WITH THE VOICES OF THE AIR AND BADE HIM HAIL
NOR WAS IT CONFINED TO THEMSELVES FOR TWO INVITED MEMBERS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE ALSO PARTOOK OF A FULL SHARE
I HAVE SERVED UNDER MISS MARY DADE OF ALEXANDRIA--MISS DADE WAS A VERY CLEVER MISTRESS SHE HIRED ME OUT
HE HAD BEEN PROVIDED WITH PLENTY OF HARD DRUDGERY--HEWING OF WOOD AND DRAWING OF WATER AND HAD HARDLY BEEN TREATED AS WELL AS A GENTLEMAN WOULD TREAT A DUMB BRUTE
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE THEY ARE THUS EMBRACED UNDER A GENERAL HEAD
I AM ONLY GOT $1.50 AND I FEEL AS IF I HAD AN INDEPENDENT FORTUNE BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT I AM GOING TO BE IDLE BECAUSE I AM ON FREE GROUND AND I SHALL ALWAYS WORK THOUGH I AM NOT GOT NOTHING TO DO AT PRESENT
AND ON THE SCORE OF HOW HE CAME TO ESCAPE HE SAID
BUT THE THING TO WHICH I IMPLORE YOUR ATTENTION NOW IS NOT WHAT WE KNOW AND FEEL BUT THE DELUSION WHICH WE ARE UNDER IN CONFOUNDING KNOWING WITH DOING IN FANCYING THAT WE ARE WORKING TO ABOLISH SLAVERY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS WRONG

FIERCE FIERY AND IMPULSIVE HE WAS AS QUICK TO DECIDE AS TO PERFORM

HIS STORY RAN THUS
ADD TO THE ABOVE MARSHALL BUTTON AND GEORGE LIGHT BOTH SINGLE YOUNG MEN AND WE HAVE TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL AS HEARTY-LOOKING BRAVE AND INTERESTING SPECIMENS OF SLAVERY AS COULD WELL BE PRODUCED FROM MARYLAND
BUT HE FELT PRETTY SURE THAT HE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF IN HER MAJESTY'S DOMINION
MILLER FROM BOYHOOD INTIMATELY AND I HERE TAKE PLEASURE IN SAYING THAT HE WAS AN HONEST UNASSUMING MAN OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER AND STERN INTEGRITY AND WOULD HAVE SPURNED THE IDEA OF ANY COMPLICATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH SLAVERY OR KIDNAPPING

NEVER DID A MERCHANT STUDY MORE CLOSELY THE VARIED RELATIONS OF BUSINESS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON HIS INTERESTS THAN DID THOMAS SHIPLEY ALL THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH CONCERNED THE WELL-BEING OF THOSE FOR WHOM HE WAS SO WARMLY INTERESTED
NORTH AND SOUTH HAVE BOTH BEEN GUILTY AND THEY THAT SIN MUST SUFFER ALSO IN HARMONY WITH THE ABOVE SENTIMENTS CAME A NUMBER OF VERSES APPROPRIATE TO HER DESIRES IN THIS RESPECT ONE OF WHICH WE HERE GIVE AS A SAMPLE
SHE IS REMAINING JUST AS YOU LEFT HER SHE SAYS AND SHE WILL NEVER BE RECONCILED TO YOUR CONDUCT
HE BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY CLEARED THEMSELVES--HAVE ESCAPED TO A FREE STATE AND WE THINK IT EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT HE IS IN THE RIGHT
HAVING OBTAINED THE NECESSARY PAPERS HE LEFT AT ONCE FOR MOUNT HOLLY WHERE HE ARRIVED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY IN TIME TO PLACE THE WRITS IN THE HANDS OF THE SHERIFF JUST BEFORE THE DECISION OF JUDGE H
BUT THE BOOK HAS A HIGHER MEANING AND USE
AS A FRIEND I ADMIRED HIM AND OWE HIS MEMORY THIS TRIBUTE TO DEPARTED WORTH
I WELL REMEMBER THAT ONE MORNING AS I ENTERED THE SABBATH-SCHOOL,[A ONE OF THE SCHOLARS A MRS MERCY SMITH BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER CLASS AND THERE INTRODUCED TO ME A YOUNG GIRL OF ABOUT FIFTEEN AS A FUGITIVE WHO HAD ARRIVED THE DAY BEFORE
SHE BEING NATURALLY OF A HAPPY DISPOSITION OBLIGING COMPETENT THERE WAS BUT LITTLE ROOM FOR ANY JARS IN THE HOUSEHOLD SO FAR AS MARY WAS CONCERNED
THIS OFFER SHE WAS INCLINED TO ACCEPT BUT DISLIKED THE IDEA OF BEING ENCUMBERED WITH THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY AND THE DUTIES OF A FAMILY AT THE SAME TIME
ROBERT FOUND NO REST UNDER MR WRIGHT
THE FREIGHT-MASTER TOLD HIM TO TAKE IT AND GO AHEAD WITH IT NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
TRUE HE HAD TWO SISTERS IN PHILADELPHIA FOR WHOM HE HAD ALWAYS CHERISHED THE WARMEST AFFECTION BUT HE CONFERRED NOT WITH THEM ON THIS MOMENTOUS MISSION

ELIJAH PENNYPACKER SOME TIME SINCE INFORMED ME HE COULD FIND EMPLOYMENT IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR TWO OR THREE GOOD HANDS
SARAH WAS A WOMAN OF BECOMING MANNERS OF A DARK BROWN COMPLEXION AND LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE MIGHT DO A FAIR SHARE OF HOUSEWORK IF TREATED WELL
THE MEN WHO ARE REALLY CHARGEABLE WITH TREASON AGAINST THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE DEATH OF MR GORSUCH AN ESTIMABLE CITIZEN OF MARYLAND ARE UNQUESTIONABLY WHITE WITH HEARTS BLACK ENOUGH TO INCITE THEM TO THE COMMISSION OF ANY CRIME EQUAL IN ATROCITY TO THAT COMMITTED IN LANCASTER COUNTY
DAVID HAD NO TASTE FOR SLAVERY INDEED FELT THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO A LIFE OF SERVITUDE FOR THE SPECIAL BENEFIT OF OTHERS
MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE WARM-HEARTED ABOLITIONISTS AND THE WHOLE NUMBER TAUGHT IN THIS SCHOOL DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED TO MY INQUIRY HAVE YOU PARENTS LIVING AND ALSO BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE REPLIED
HOW MUCH FOR THE WIFE THEY COULD NOT TELL
BUT THEY TRUSTED IN GOD AND KEPT THE NORTH STAR IN VIEW
AT THE TIME OF JOSEPH'S ESCAPE HE WAS OWNED BY JACOB KNEELAND WHO HAD FALLEN HEIR TO HIM AS A PART OF HIS FATHER'S ESTATE
HE DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD AND SO HE STAYED AND DIED BROKEN-HEARTED CRAZY
IT GOT SAFE TO ELMIRA AS I HAVE HAD A LETTER FROM JONES AND ALL IS SAFE
SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY CRUELLY TREATED THAT SHE WAS OWNED BY A MAN NAMED JOSEPH O'NEIL A TAX COLLECTOR AND A VERY BAD MAN UNDER SAID O'NEIL SHE HAD BEEN REQUIRED TO CHOP WOOD CURRY HORSES WORK IN THE FIELD LIKE A MAN AND ALL ONE WINTER SHE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO GO BAREFOOTED
ONE OF WESLEY'S COMPANIONS ALSO FOUGHT HEROICALLY AND ONLY YIELDED WHEN BADLY WOUNDED AND QUITE OVERPOWERED
AND MR FIDLER WHO IS A CAPTAIN OR COLONEL THOUGHT SOME TIME SINCE THAT THERE WERE MORE COLORED THAN WHITE WHO WERE LEARNING OR HAD LEARNED TO READ
I HAVE AVOIDED SAYING I AM FROM PHILADELPHIA
IN PASSING THROUGH PHILADELPHIA FROM WASHINGTON ONE VERY WARM JULY DAY IN 1855 ACCOMPANIED BY THREE OF HIS SLAVES HIS HIGH OFFICIAL EQUILIBRIUM AS WELL AS HIS ASSUMED RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION RECEIVED A TERRIBLE SHOCK AT THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE
SHE WAS A PRETTY FINE WOMAN BUT THE CHILDREN WERE ALL BAD
THIS TRAVELER WAS A MAN WHO MIGHT BE SAID TO BE FULL OF YEARS INFIRM AND WELL-NIGH USED UP UNDER A VIRGINIA TASK-MASTER
LAST NIGHT I HAD SOME OF THE REBS TO HEAR ME PART OF THE TIME SOME OF THE WHITE FOLKS COME OUT OUR MEETINGS ARE JUST AS QUIET AND AS ORDERLY ON THE WHOLE IN CAROLINA AS ONE MIGHT DESIRE
JAMES MERCER'S LETTER
CARPENTER WM 464
BUT EVEN NOW WHEN I GO HOME IN THE EVENING IF I HAPPEN TO LOOK MORE SERIOUS THAN USUAL MY WIFE NOTICES IT AND ASKS
I HAVE MET WITH A GENTLEMAN HERE BY THE NAME OF MR TRUEHART AND HE SENDS HIS BEST LOVE TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
AFTER THE EXPERIENCE OF A FEW WEEKS THE PURSUERS CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERING THEM THROUGH THESE AGENCIES OR THROUGH THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
PRESENTING MYSELF AT THE APPOINTED TIME WHEN MY NAME WAS ANNOUNCED INSTEAD OF COMING FORWARD PROMPTLY TO TAKE ME BY THE HAND HE SCRUTINIZED ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND THEN INQUIRED SOMEWHAT DUBIOUSLY HAVE I THE PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING MR GARRISON OF BOSTON IN THE UNITED STATES YES SIR I REPLIED I AM HE
NOW AS HE COULD HAVE NO FORE-KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PLACE OR PERSON INTO WHOSE HANDS HE MIGHT BE CONSIGNED BY THE AUCTIONEER HE CONCLUDED THAT HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RISK HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF THE YOUNG HEIRS
BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SLAVERY WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM
IN A LETTER WHICH GRACE ANNA WROTE AFTER SHE HAD ATTENDED FOR SOME TIME IN PERSON TO THE PATIENT WITH THE CARE AND SYMPATHY WHICH HIS CONDITION DEMANDED AND BEGUN TO FEEL HER STRENGTH UNEQUAL TO THE TASK IN ADDITION TO HER HOUSEHOLD DUTIES SHE ASKED A FRIEND IN PHILADELPHIA TO PROCURE FOR HER A TRUSTY COLORED WOMAN FIT TO BE A HELPER IN THE WORK OFFERING HIGHER WAGES THAN WERE COMMON IN THAT REGION FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED AND ADDING THAT INDEED THEY COULD NOT STAND UPON THE AMOUNT OF PAY BUT MUST HAVE HELP IF IT COULD BE OBTAINED THOUGH NOT IN A CONDITION TO BEAR UNDUE EXPENDITURE

A PART OF THE TIME WILLIAM SAID HE HAD HAD IT PRETTY ROUGH AND A PART OF THE TIME KINDER SMOOTH BUT NEVER HAD HAD MATTERS TO HIS SATISFACTION
SHE AT THAT TIME MADE HER HOME WITH A FAMILY NAMED AMOS
THE ABOLITIONISTS OF COURSE MOURN THE OCCURRENCE WHILE THEY SEE IN IT A LEGITIMATE FRUIT OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW JUST SUCH A HARVEST OF BLOOD AS THEY HAD LONG FEARED THAT THE LAW WOULD PRODUCE AND WHICH THEY HAD EARNESTLY LABORED TO PREVENT
HE WAS HOWEVER CONSTRAINED TO MAKE AN EFFORT
DID THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY HAVE THEIR NOTIONS OF PROPRIETY SHOCKED BY THE MATTER
CLAIMANT IN A SUMMARY MANNER AND UPON SATISFACTORY PROOF BEING MADE BY DEPOSITION OR AFFIDAVIT IN WRITING TO BE TAKEN AND CERTIFIED BY SUCH COURT JUDGE OR COMMISSIONER OR BY OTHER SATISFACTORY TESTIMONY DULY TAKEN AND CERTIFIED BY SOME COURT MAGISTRATE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OR OTHER LEGAL OFFICER AUTHORIZED TO ADMINISTER AN OATH AND TAKE DEPOSITIONS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OR TERRITORY FROM WHICH SUCH PERSON OWING SERVICE OR LABOR MAY HAVE ESCAPED WITH A CERTIFICATE OF SUCH MAGISTRATE OR OTHER AUTHORITY AS AFORESAID WITH THE SEAL OF THE PROPER COURT OR OFFICER THERETO ATTACHED WHICH SEAL SHALL BE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THE COMPETENCY OF THE PROOF AND WITH PROOF ALSO BY AFFIDAVIT OF THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON WHOSE SERVICE OR LABOR IS CLAIMED TO BE DUE AS AFORESAID THAT THE PERSON SO ARRESTED DOES IN FACT OWE SERVICE OR LABOR TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS CLAIMING HIM OR HER IN THE STATE OR TERRITORY FROM WHICH SUCH FUGITIVE MAY HAVE ESCAPED AS AFORESAID AND THAT
THIS GOOD NEWS WAS CONVEYED TO WILLIAM AND AFFORDED HIM A RAY OF HOPE IN THE WILDERNESS
THESE PASSENGERS SEEMED TO BE WELL POSTED IN REGARD TO SLAVERY AND UNDERSTOOD FULL WELL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IN FLEEING FROM KIND-HEARTED MASTERS
THE CAUSES OF HIS IMPRISONMENT AT BALTIMORE SCARCELY NEED TO BE REPEATED
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE COMING GENERATIONS UNDERSTAND NOT THE FLAMING ANTAGONISM TO HUMANITY BUT THE MORE BRUTAL AVOIDANCE OF IT THAT RULED THE POLITICAL TONE IN THIS LATITUDE FROM 1836 TO 1861
THE ONE TO WHOM I ALLUDE IS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE BY THE NAME OF JIM WHO FLED FROM NEAR CHARLESTON S.C

DR PRICE CLAIMED HIM AS HIS PERSONAL PROPERTY AND EXACTED ALL HIS HIRE AND LABOR
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OTHER LETTER FROM YOU AND CAN GET NO ACCOUNT OF THEM IN THE POST OFFICE IN THIS PLACE I AM WELL AND HAVE GOT A GOOD SITUATION IN THIS CITY AND INTEND STAYING HERE
FROM CERTAIN MOVEMENTS WHICH LOOKED VERY SUSPICIOUS IN JOHN'S EYES HE HAD BEEN ALLOTTED TO THE SOUTHERN MARKET HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO LOOK OUT FOR A HABITATION IN CANADA
HE HAD VOLUNTEERED HIS SERVICES AS THEIR ADVOCATE AND THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FAITHFULLY SERVED HAD THEY POURED OUT THE WEALTH OF CROESUS AT THE FEET OF THE MOST LEARNED COUNSEL
HE BELIEVED THAT OUR NATIONAL CONSTITUTION DID INDEED HOLD MANY COMPROMISES WITH SLAVERY BUT WAS FRAMED IN THE MAJORITY OF ITS PROVISIONS AND CERTAINLY IN THE TOTALITY OF ITS SPIRIT IN THE INTERESTS OF FREEDOM
I WRITE AND ALSO SEND YOU A PAPER OF THE CASE WHEN IT COMES OUT
THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS REFERENCE TO HER PROSPECTS GOING TO CALIFORNIA HER HUSBAND ETC
WE SLAVES ALL KNEW IT AND WE TOLD HER
LEGS ARMS AND BODY BEING HANDLED AS HORSE-JOCKIES TREAT HORSES
YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF THE SLAVE WITHOUT REMEMBERING HER WHO DID SO MUCH TO MAKE SLAVERY IMPOSSIBLE
BUT WHAT PARTICULAR ONE OR THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY EMBARKED IN THE ENTERPRISE I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEARN
ARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND DELAWARE
ARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND DELAWARE
SHE SPOKE A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE DIFFERENT FREEDMEN SCHOOLS AND THE COLORED CHURCHES IN CHARLESTON ONCE IN THE LEGISLATIVE HALL AND ALSO IN ONE OF THE COLORED CHURCHES IN COLUMBIA
HERE AGAIN WE ARE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH TOOK PLACE WHEN COTTON WAS KING AND THE SLAVE-POWER OF THE SOUTH COULD BOASTINGLY SAY IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE APOCALYPTIC WOMAN I SIT AS A QUEEN AND SHALL SEE NO SORROW WHEN THAT POWER WAS MADDENED TO DESPERATION BY THE HEROISM OF THE MARTYR JOHN BROWN AND THE FETTERED BONDMEN WERE EVER AND ANON TRAVELING OVER THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
LEFT HER MOTHER TWO SISTERS AND FOUR BROTHERS IN BONDAGE
THEY TOLD ME ANYTHING--TOLD ME TO OBEY MY MASTER BUT I DIDN'T MIND THAT
SHE CONDEMNED SLAVERY IN ALL ITS PHASES AS A MONSTER TO BE LOATHED AS THE ENEMY OF GOD AND MAN OFTEN AFTER LISTENING ATTENTIVELY FOR HOURS TOGETHER TO RECITALS OF A VERY HARROWING NATURE ESPECIALLY FROM FEMALES HER MIND WOULD SEEM TO BE FILLED WITH THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SLAVE AND IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO WITHDRAW FROM THEM EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ON THE EVE OF TAKING UP THEIR MARCH FOR A MORE DISTANT STATION
WILLIAM DID NOT GIVE HIM A VERY BAD CHARACTER
THE HUSBAND IN DEFIANCE OF THE DIVINE COMMAND WAS TO BE WRESTED FROM THE FOND EMBRACE OF HIS SORROWING WIFE TO SPEND HIS DAYS IN MISERY AND TOIL
THERE HE COULD NOT CONSENT TO STAY AND STARVE TO DEATH
BUT HERE AGAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PROVE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED WAS A DIRECT PERSONAL ACTOR IN THE VIOLENCE
1 HAWK
PROBABLY THE SIMPLE CONVICTION THAT HE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE DOING AS HE WOULD BE DONE BY ACTUATED HIM IN GOING DOWN SOUTH OCCASIONALLY TO ASSIST SOME OF HIS SUFFERING FRIENDS TO GET THE YOKES OFF THEIR NECKS AND WITH HIM ESCAPE TO FREEDOM
FROM GEN
SHE LOOKS AROUND HER WITH WARY EYE--SCENTS THE AIR--A FLASH AND SHE IS HIDDEN FROM THE CROWD WHICH YOU SEE AROUND HER--SHE IS FREE
IN THEIR LETTER THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY IN CANADA AND WERE HAVING GOOD TIMES,--IN THE EATING LINE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THE BEST,--ALSO HAD VERY CHOICE WINES AND BRANDIES WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THAT THEY TRADER AND OYSTER-HOUSE KEEPER WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE A SMACK AT AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A VERY CORDIAL INVITATION TO MAKE THEM A VISIT AND SUGGESTED THAT THE QUICKEST WAY THEY COULD COME WOULD BE BY TELEGRAPH WHICH THEY ADMITTED WAS SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS AND WITHOUT FIRST GREASING THEMSELVES AND THEN HANGING ON VERY FAST THE JOURNEY MIGHT NOT PROVE ALTOGETHER ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM
SHE WOULD FIGHT AND SWEAR TOO WHEN SHE GOT READY
AFTER WE WERE FAIRLY CAPTURED WE WERE TAKEN TO TERRYTOWN WHICH WAS IN SIGHT OF WHERE WE WERE BETRAYED
THE 5 OF LAST WEEK HAVE GONE OVER TO TORONTO
WHILE THEY SPOKE OF LEWIS AS MODERATE ETC THEY ALL SAID THAT HE ALLOWED NO PRIVILEGES TO HIS SLAVES
THE MAN-HUNTERS HEADED BY A CONSTABLE WITH A SEARCH WARRANT TOOK HER THENCE AND LODGED HER IN NEW CASTLE JAIL
IF I SAID SO I DID NOT MEAN IT SAID HIS HONOR WHEN THE SLAVE ON A CERTAIN OCCASION ALLUDED TO THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH HE CONSENTED TO LEAVE HOME ETC
ESCAPING IN A CHEST
ESCAPING IN A CHEST
HEROISM IN ITS NATIVE MAJESTY COMMANDED ONE'S ADMIRATION AND LOVE

AND TO CLOSE THE MATTER I WISH IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I DO NOT DESIRE TO HOLD ANY FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE WITH MAJOR RONEY OF DINWIDDIE VIRGINIA ABOUT HIS BOY TUCKER WHITE ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK

AS THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT TOWARD THE BARN WILLIAM WRIGHT WAVING HIS HAND TOWARD THE FORMER SAID YOU SEE THEY ARE NOT ANYWHERE THERE THEY THEN WENT TO THE BARN AND GAVE IT A THOROUGH SEARCH
I PLEADED WITH ALL THE EARNESTNESS OF MY SOUL AND SO DID MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS BUT THOUGH I AM CERTAIN MANY WERE MOVED IN CONSCIENCE AGAINST THE SAVAGE OUTRAGE AND DID THEIR WORK WITH A STINGING HEART YET THEY FELT THAT THEY MUST STICK TO THEIR PARTY AND COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION

SHE WAS WITH ME A PART OF A YEAR

LOGAN W.J LETTER 158
ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LARGE WOMAN ABOVE REFERRED TO AND ONE OTHER FEMALE WERE REQUIRED TO ENTER A HOLE APPARENTLY LEADING THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT BUT IN REALITY ONLY A DEPARTMENT WHICH HAD BEEN EXPRESSLY CONSTRUCTED FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CAPTAIN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN PLAN
HE ALWAYS SAID HE WOULD SELL BEFORE HE WOULD USE A WHIP
SLAVERY EXISTED EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CRUSHING SOULS AND BREAKING TENDER HEARTS
BUT DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD COME TO SPY OUT THE LAND THE WAGON AND THE PERSONS WALKING WITH IT HAD BEEN OBSERVED FROM HIS HOUSE AND HE HAD REPORTED THE FACT IN MIDDLETOWN
THE FATHER OWNED THE CHILD BUT THE MOTHER DENIED IT

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN ORDER TO EVADE THE ADVANCING FOE THEY ALL MARCHED INTO THE RIVER THE WATER BEING SHALLOW AND WITH THE VESSEL FOR A BREASTWORK HIDING THEM FROM THE SHORE THERE THEY REMAINED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF
NO PHASE OF THAT STRUGGLE WAS SO CROWDED WIFH THRILLING INCIDENTS HEROIC ADVENTURES AND SELF-SACRIFICING EFFORTS AS THE ONE YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PORTRAY AND WITH WHICH YOU WERE SO CLOSELY CONNECTED TO WIT THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD WHILE IT WILL BE CONTEMPLATED WITH SHAME SADNESS AND ASTONISHMENT BY POSTERITY IT WILL SERVE VIVIDLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE PERILS WHICH EVERYWHERE CONFRONTED THE FUGITIVES FROM THE SOUTHERN HOUSE OF BONDAGE AND TO WHICH THOSE WHO DARED TO GIVE THEM FOOD AND SHELTER WERE ALSO SUBJECTED
WHEN THE SLAVES GOT SICK HE DOCTORED THEM HIMSELF HE WAS TOO STINGY TO EMPLOY A PHYSICIAN

AFTER HIS LYING AND CHEATING IN THIS WAY DAVID RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS CHANCES ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IT WAS PUT AWAY WITH OTHER VALUABLE U.G.R.R
BY SOME MEANS HE AND THE MASTER SO SAYS REPORT WENT TO VINCENNES AND CLAIMED THE FUGITIVES CHAINED MR CONCKLIN AND HURRIED ALL OFF

AT THE SAME TIME ASSERTING THAT IF HE KNEW WHERE THE NIGGER WAS HE WOULD GIVE HIM UP AS $100 DID NOT COME ALONG EVERY DAY
THE MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE QUITE TALL WITH A COUNTENANCE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE WELL FITTED TO AWAKEN SYMPATHY AT FIRST SIGHT

THREE REVOLVERS THREE DOUBLE-BARRELED PISTOLS THREE SINGLE-BARRELED PISTOLS THREE SWORD-CANES FOUR BUTCHER KNIVES ONE BOWIE-KNIFE AND ONE PAW.[A THUS FULLY RESOLVED UPON FREEDOM OR DEATH WITH SCARCELY PROVISIONS ENOUGH FOR A SINGLE DAY WHILE THE RAIN AND STORM WAS PITEOUSLY DESCENDING FATHERS AND MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS AARON CORNISH HAD TWO)--THE ENTIRE PARTY STARTED
FREEMAN WM
HE THE MASTER COULD SELL HIM FOR MUCH MORE AT THIRTY-SEVEN THAN AT FORTY-SEVEN
FOR THE HAZARDOUS WORK BEFORE HIM HE WAS AT ONCE PREPARED TO MAKE A START
HE TOLD ME THAT HIS FATHER WAS DR
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER HER ESCAPE ROBERTA APPEARED TO APPRECIATE HER SITUATION MOST FULLY
AND IN ADDITION TO BEING SHOT THIS TIME ANTHONY WAS STILL FURTHER BROKE IN BY A TERRIBLE FLOGGING FROM THE SHERIFF
BUT THE STORY OF MARIA TOLD IN AN EARNEST AND INTELLIGENT MANNER WAS AT ONCE CALCULATED TO DISSIPATE THE IDEA OF A COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE IN A STATE OF BONDAGE
BY HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HARRIET COULD VERY WELL JUDGE WHAT THEIR FATE WOULD BE WHEN REACHING MAN AND WOMANHOOD
PETER WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD TOO BUT HIS OWNER WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS TOO GOOD A CHRISTIAN TO VIOLATE THE LAWS BY RUNNING AWAY
UNDER HER FORMER LOT SHE SCARCELY MURMURED BUT DECLARED THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AT EASE IN SLAVERY A DAY AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER FIRST-BORN
LEFT HIS FATHER FOUR BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS
AND YET HIS PLEASURE WAS SADLY MARRED BY THE REFLECTION THAT HIS BOSOM COMPANION WAS STILL IN BONDAGE IN THE GLOOMY PRISON-HOUSE
MY INFORMANT SAYS HE IS LIKELY TO RECOVER BUT IT WILL LEAVE AN UGLY MARK IT IS THOUGHT AS LONG AS HE LIVES
HE ARE NOT STOPING WITH US AT THIS TIME
HE WAS OWNED BY MRS CAROLINE BRANG A WIDOW
THEY HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO BY THE LADIES SOCIETY AND ARE MOST GRATEFUL FOR ANY ATTENTION THEY HAVE RECEIVED
HEZEKIAH HILL ENSIGN
HERE HOWEVER WAS A CHANCE OF THROWING OFF THE YOKE EVEN IF IT COST THEM THEIR LIVES
MY BROTHER IS DEAD
I MET THEM AT THE GATE AND THE CONSTABLE HANDED ME AN ADVERTISEMENT WHEREIN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR THE RECOVERY OF THREE RUNAWAY SLAVES THEREIN DESCRIBED
IN THE OLD DOMINION
I AM SIR TO YOU AND OTHERS UNDER MORE OBLIGATIONS FOR YOUR KINDLY PROTECTION OF ME THAN I CAN IN ANY WAY EXPRESS AT PRESENT
NEVERTHELESS SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE HER PLACE IN THE FIELD WITH THE REST OF THE SLAVES OF MORE RUGGED CONSTITUTION UNTIL SHE HAD PASSED HER TWENTIETH YEAR AND HAD BECOME A MOTHER
WHO COULD REFRAIN FROM AIDING ON TO FREEDOM CHILDREN HONORED IN SUCH A HEROIC PARENT
13
AND THE UNIVERSAL CONSENT OF ALL GOOD MEN WHOSE MORAL VISION IS NOT OBSCURED BY THE MIST OF A LOW MISGUIDED SELFISHNESS
HENCE AS SETH WAS A MAN WHO SEEMED WHOLLY INSENSIBLE TO FEAR AND TO KNOW NO OTHER LAW OF HUMANITY AND RIGHT THAN WHENEVER THE CLAIMS OF THE SUFFERING AND THE WRONGED APPEALED TO HIM TO RESPOND UNRESERVEDLY WHETHER THOSE THUS INJURED WERE AMONGST HIS NEAREST KIN OR THE GREATEST STRANGERS,--IT MATTERED NOT TO WHAT RACE OR CLIME THEY MIGHT BELONG,--HE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN OWNING ALL SUCH AS HIS NEIGHBORS VOLUNTEERED HIS SERVICES WITHOUT PAY OR REWARD TO GO AND RESCUE THE WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN OF PETER STILL
AS THIS WOULD NECESSITATE A SALE OF THE SLAVES LAURA DETERMINED NOT TO BE ON HAND WHEN THE SELLING DAY CAME SO SHE TOOK TIME BY THE FORELOCK AND LEFT
AND THE AXE WAS USED WITH TERRIBLE EFFECT BY ONE OF THE DEPUTIES
FLETCHER AND DANIEL NEALL
HE ALSO EXPRESSED DOUBTS AS TO THE GENUINENESS OF THIS PASS AND WISHED THE MAN TO GO TO MIDDLETOWN ON THAT ACCOUNT ALSO
IN A WORD WHEN THE BARBARISM OF SLAVERY WAS MORE EXPOSED AND CONDEMNED THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME
A FIERCE GALE WAS BLOWING AND THE WAVES WERE RUNNING FEARFULLY HIGH
DURING THAT TIME MR GARRISON'S LIFE WAS IN THE MOST IMMINENT PERIL
AS THE OTHER TWO COMPANIONS OF JOHN WESLEY WERE ADVERTISED IN THE BALTIMORE SUN WE AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE LIGHT THUS PUBLICLY AFFORDED
ABOUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE I LEFT THE OVERSEER IN A VIOLENT FIT OF BAD TEMPER SHOT AND BADLY WOUNDED A YOUNG SLAVE MAN BY THE NAME OF HENRY WATERS BUT NO SOONER THAN HE GOT WELL ENOUGH HE ESCAPED AND HAD NOT BEEN HEARD OF UP TO THE TIME ABRAM LEFT
BUT SUSAN WAS RATHER THANKFUL FOR THESE SIGNS OF WEAKNESS AS SHE WAS THEREBY ENABLED TO MATURE HER PLANS AND THUS TO ELUDE DETECTION
BUT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THE ASCENT AND STAND NOW ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
JOHNSON ROSANNA 516
WITH OUR UNITED KINDEST REMEMBRANCE SINCERELY ANNA H
ALLEN HAD CHARGE OF THEM
JOHN WAS A STURDY-LOOKING CHATTEL BUT POSSESSED FAR LESS INTELLIGENCE THAN THE GENERALITY OF PASSENGERS
AMONG THEM ALL THEY HAD ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS
THE NEGROES BELONG TO B
NOT SAFE TO UNDERTAKE TO SEE THEM TILL SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN THEY WOULD BE AT HOME
SOON AFTER HIS RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC LIFE HE UNITED HIMSELF WITH THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS BUT WAS MUCH TOO RADICAL TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE ADDITION
IN THE NATURE OF THE CASE DINAH WAS NOW FREE BUT SHE WAS NOT WHOLLY ALONE IN THE WORLD
OH
OH
SCARCELY A WEEK PASSED HOWEVER BEFORE THE MATTER WAS LOOKED UPON IN A FAR DIFFERENT LIGHT AND IT WAS PRETTY GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT IF THE LORD HAD NOT A DIRECT HAND IN IT THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AT LEAST WOULD BE GREATLY BENEFITED THEREBY
DAVIS
HE FLED FROM THOMAS MURPHY A FARMER AND REGULAR SLAVE-HOLDER
HE RESOLVED TO GO AT ALL HAZARDS
HIS EDUCATION WITH REGARD TO BOOKS WAS QUITE LIMITED
JOHNSON 305
5 CHAP
HORATIO TOLD OF A VISIT WHICH HIS MASTER MADE TO CANADA AND WHICH ON HIS RETURN HE HAD TAKEN MUCH PAINS TO REPORT TO THE SLAVES TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE THE PREVIOUS SUMMER AND SAW THE COUNTRY FOR HIMSELF ADDING IN WORDS SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS
THE PARTIES SPEEDILY CAME TO BLOWS
INDEED WHO COULD CLOSE HIS EYES AND EARS TO THE PLAINTIVE CRIES OF SUCH A MOTHER
BEING DRESSED IN HER SUNDAY BEST AND BEFORE A POOR CANDLE-LIGHT SHE APPEARED TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
HER ZEAL IN BEHALF OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE AND ESPECIALLY IN BEHALF OF THE FUGITIVE A ZEAL THAT ABSORBED ALL THE POWERS OF HER NOBLE NATURE WAS A PERPETUAL REBUKE TO THE COMPARATIVE COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE OF THOSE AROUND HER
AT SUCH A MOMENT
BEFORE A GREAT WHILE HOWEVER SHE WAS PREVAILED UPON TO TAKE A CUP OF TEA
WHILE THESE TWO LARGE MEN TOM AND JOHN WERE THERE ALONG CAME ROBERT OTHER NAME UNKNOWN IN A BAD PLIGHT HIS FEET BLEEDING
I HAVE BEEN OUT OF EMPLOY ABOUT FIVE WEEKS I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO AUSTRALIA
I WOULD ADD HERE THAT DANIEL GIBBONS FAITHFUL WIFE ONE OF THE BEST WOMEN I EVER KNEW WAS ALWAYS READY DAY OR NIGHT TO DO ALL SHE POSSIBLY COULD TO HELP THE POOR FUGITIVES ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM
ON PREPARING TO TAKE THE UNDERGROUND HE ARMED HIMSELF WITH A BIG BUTCHER-KNIFE AND RESOLVED IF ATTACKED TO MAKE HIS ENEMIES STAND BACK
THAT WILLIAM PENN WHO WORKED SO FAITHFULLY FOR TWO YEARS FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF ANN MARIA MAY NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEVOTING ALL HIS TIME AND SYMPATHY TOWARDS THIS SINGLE OBJECT IT SEEMS EXPEDIENT THAT TWO OR THREE ADDITIONAL LETTERS PROPOSING CERTAIN GRAND UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PLANS SHOULD HAVE A PLACE HERE
TO REJOICE THAT UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION HAS AT LAST BEEN PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES
I HESITATED ABOUT COMING
YOU WILL SEE BY THIS THAT I AM IN THE SUNNY SOUTH
THE MOST STRIKING CHARACTERISTIC IN HORSEY'S CHARACTER ACCORDING TO PLYMOUTH'S IDEA WAS THAT HE WAS VERY HARD TO PLEASE DID NOT KNOW WHEN A SLAVE DID ENOUGH HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY COULD GET TIRED OR THAT THEY NEEDED ANY PRIVILEGES HE WAS THE OWNER OF SIX SLAVES WAS ENGAGED IN FARMING AND MERCANTILE PURSUITS AND THE POSTMASTER OF THE BOROUGH IN WHICH HE LIVED
GRIFFISS ST LEONARDS CALVERT COUNTY MD
JOHN WESLEY PEARSON WHO WAS ENGAGED IN SCHOOL TEACHING AND PREACHING AND BELONGED TO THE MORE MODERATE CLASS OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
AND SOUTH CAROLINA
WHAT HE ATTEMPTED HE SELDOM OR NEVER FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH
EVERY HAND OF HIS FAMILY IS ADDING ITS QUOTA TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS EXPERIMENT OF A COLORED MAN BOTH TRADING AND FARMING ON AN EXTENSIVE SCALE
HE MUST HAVE LARGE GREEN SPECTACLES OVER HIS EYES AND WITHAL HE MUST BE VERY HARD OF HEARING AND DEPENDENT ON HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT AS WAS NO UNCOMMON THING WITH SLAVE-HOLDERS TO LOOK AFTER ALL HIS WANTS
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN A FEW DAYS
FURNESS ILLUSTRATION
ELIAS SNEVELEY A FARMER KNOWN ON THE ARABELLA CREEK PLACE AS A HARD SWEARER AN OLD BACHELOR AND A COMMON TORMENTOR OF ALL AROUND HIM WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN THAT HARRY SAID HE FLED FROM
SOME OF OUR PEOPLE REMIND ME OF SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD PRIVATE LECTURES TO FREEDWOMEN
HE LIVED TO SEE THE REALIZATION OF HIS HOPES FOR UNIVERSAL FREEDOM AND IN APRIL LAST ON THE OCCASION OF THE GREAT PARADE OF THE COLORED PEOPLE IN THIS CITY HE WAS CARRIED THROUGH OUR STREETS IN AN OPEN BAROUCHE SURROUNDED BY THE MEN IN WHOSE BEHALF HE HAD LABORED SO FAITHFULLY AND THE GUARDS AROUND HIS CARRIAGE CARRYING BANNERS WITH THE INSCRIPTION OUR MOSES A MOSES HE WAS TO THEIR RACE
LOUIS MO
I ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING HE REPLIED HE HAD A NOTION TO PUT FOR CANADA
HIS FRIENDS HERE THINK THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR HIM BUT TO GO TO THE PENITENTIARY
SHE HAD HOWEVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ON THE QUESTION OF HER RIGHTS BEFORE THIS OUTRAGE
HE POSITIVELY REFUSED TO CARRY OUT THE PREVIOUS EVENING'S CONTRACT THUS LEAVING HER IN THE HANDS OF HER MISTRESS WITH THE ADVICE THAT SHE SHOULD DOCTOR HER UP THE MISTRESS NOT DISPOSED TO BE DEFEATED OBVIATED THE DIFFICULTY BY SELECTING A LITTLE BOY MADE A LOT OF THE TWO AND THUS MADE IT AN INDUCEMENT TO A PURCHASER TO BUY THE SICK WOMAN
DEAR SIR I HAVE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS FROM MY WIFE SINCE I SAW YOU AND THE SECOND WAS AWFUL
I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN SHE WENT FROM MOTHER BUT I SAW HER AT MR LATTA'S AFTERWARDS
AND FOR ALL OTHERS THE SUM OF FORTY DOLLARS
LET US HAVE ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD AND FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT KNOWING THAT THOUGH WE MAY FALL IN BATTLE THE VICTORY WILL BE OURS SOONER OR LATER
ESTHER MOORE FORTY-ONE DOLLARS MORE BY HALF THAN I EXPECTED TO WHEN I SET ABOUT IT
WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO RECEIVE AID FOR THE FUGITIVES OR FOR ANY OTHER ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE AND CONSIDER IT NO TROUBLE AT ALL TO SEND IT ON BUT DO NOT WISH TO BE MONOPOLIZING
PETER DID NOT GIVE MR BOUKLEY A VERY GOOD CHARACTER HOWEVER
THE COMMITTEE TOOK CHARGE OF HIM AND HAVING GIVEN HIM THE USUAL AID SENT HIM HOPEFULLY ON HIS WAY
IF THEY SHOULD NOT ARRIVE YOU MAY SUPPOSE IT DID NOT SUIT ELIJAH TO SEND THEM
THEY WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A COLORED MAN THAT HAS LIVED IN PHILADELPHIA AND IS FREE
HE DECLARED THAT GENERAL BRISCOE OF GEORGETOWN D.C HAD BEEN DEFRAUDING HIM OUT OF THIRTEEN DOLLARS PER MONTH THIS BEING THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH HE WAS HIRED AND INSTEAD OF BEING ALLOWED TO DRAW IT FOR HIMSELF THE GENERAL POCKETED IT
IF IT DOES NOT OPEN THE EAR TO EVERY CRY OF HUMANITY STRUGGLING UP OR SLIPPING BACK IT IS NO CULTURE PROPERLY SO CALLED BUT A SHAM A MASK OF WAX A VARNISH WITH CRUEL GLITTER
ABOUT THIS TIME HE UNITED WITH THE AMERICAN FREE PRODUCE ASSOCIATION WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED IN 1838 AND IN 1845 TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE FORMATION OF THE FREE PRODUCE ASSOCIATION OF FRIENDS OF PHILADELPHIA Y.M
MR MCMURTRIE ASKED THAT THE WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENCE BE EXCLUDED FROM THE COURT ROOM EXCEPT THE ONE UPON THE STAND
WOULD NOT A LIKE LOT OF CUMBERLAND COAL ALWAYS SELL IN PHILADELPHIA
WE WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY HOW MANY OF THE ENSLAVED THIS KIND HAND HELPED TO PURCHASE FREDERICK DOUGLASS AND MANY OTHERS BEING OF THE NUMBER HOW MANY WERE ASSISTED IN PROCURING AN EDUCATION HOW MANY WHO PINED IN SLAVE PRISONS WERE AIDED HOW MANY FLEEING OVER THE PERILOUS UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WERE BENEFITED THE ALL-SEEING EYE ALONE KNOWETH
ONCE DETERRED BY ITS OUTSIDE POLITICAL ASPECT I SHUNNED IT AS MANY DO STILL BUT THE MORE IT HAS PRESSED ITSELF ON MY ATTENTION THE MORE I HAVE CONSIDERED IT--THE MORE AND MORE MANIFEST HAS IT BECOME TO ME THAT IT IS A SUBJECT FULL OF LIGHT AND OF GUIDANCE OF WARNING AND INSPIRATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
THAT THE TWO ACTED IN CONCERT CAN ADMIT OF NO DOUBT
HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TRY HIS LUCK FOR CANADA
LEFT HER LITTLE BABY-BOY LITTLE GIRL AND HUSBAND BEHIND
THE FIRST TIME HE WAS SHOT WAS FOR REFUSING A FLOGGING WHEN ONLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS
NOT RELISHING THIS TREATMENT ALBERT AND ANTHONY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD BOATING WELL ENOUGH TO ESCAPE BY WATER
WE NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN
ANGLO-AFRICAN AND ANGLO-SAXON WERE ABOUT EQUALLY MIXED IN THE ORGANIZATION OF MR PETTIFOOT
THIS STATE OF THINGS OF COURSE MADE THE NATURALLY HOT BLOOD OF VIRGINIANS FAIRLY BOIL
CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF NORTH CAROLINA HE HAD LATELY MARRIED A FREE GIRL WHICH WAS AN INDICTABLE OFFENCE AND FOR WHICH THE PENALTY WAS THEN IN SOAK FOR HIM--SAID PENALTY TO CONSIST OF THIRTY-NINE LASHES AND IMPRISONMENT AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE
THERE THEY TOOK THE CARS AND WALKED NO MORE
IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO SAY TO THEM
AND WHAT PRAY IS THAT
MR PETTIFOOT REACHED PHILADELPHIA BY THE RICHMOND LINE OF STEAMERS STOWED AWAY AMONG THE POTS AND COOKING UTENSILS
IF YOU KNOW ANY ONE WHO WOULD GIVE ME AN EDUCATION WRITE AND LET ME KNOW FOR I AM IN WANT OF IT VERY MUCH
NOTWITHSTANDING SO MUCH PAINS HAD BEEN RESORTED TO THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH TO IMPRESS THESE IDEAS UPON THE SLAVES NO CONVERTS WERE MADE
I TOLD BRO
DEAR SIR:--I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU THAT I ARRIVED IN THIS PLACE THIS MORNING WELL AND CHEERFUL
THE COMING OF THIS PARTY WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE SUBJOINED LETTER
THERE WAS NO EXCITEMENT AROUND THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE OWING TO A MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO THE TIME OF EXAMINATION
BUT WHILE MRS CARROLL WAS VERY KIND TO HER SERVANTS HER MANAGER WAS EQUALLY AS CRUEL
I WROTE TO MY FRIEND THOMAS GARRETT DESIRING HIM TO GET A GOOD HOME FOR MOLLY
DEAR HENRY:--YOUR MOTHER AND MYSELF RECEIVED YOUR LETTER
PLYMOUTH CANNON HORATIO WILKINSON LEMUEL MITCHELL JOSIAH MITCHELL GEORGE HENRY BALLARD AND JOHN MITCHELL
ROBERTS ESQ SEVERAL OF THE KEEPERS AND MR HANES ONE OF THE PRISON OFFICERS DINED WITH THE PRISONERS AS THEIR GUESTS
PRECIOUS INDEED WERE THOSE SEASONS OF OUTPOURING WHEN ONE INTERESTING RECITAL SUGGESTED ANOTHER TILL THE LISTENER SEEMED TO SEE THE WHOLE MYSTERY OF PRISON-LIFE AND OBSCURE WRETCHEDNESS LAID OPEN BEFORE HIM WITH THE DISTINCTNESS OF A PICTURE
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THEM
SINCE THE DAY OF 76 THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A POPULAR DEMONSTRATION ON THE SIDE OF HUMAN FREEDOM IN THIS REGION
MY BEST RESPECTS TO ALL FRIENDS
THEY WOULDN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING TO EAT HARDLY
PLEASE SAY TO MY FRIEND REBECCA HART THAT I HAVE HERETOFORE KEPT CLEAR OF PERSUADING OR EVEN ADVISING SLAVES TO LEAVE THEIR MASTERS TILL THEY HAD FULLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO LEAVE KNOWING AS I DO THERE IS GREAT RISK IN SO DOING AND IF BETRAYED ONCE WOULD BE A SERIOUS INJURY TO THE CAUSE HEREAFTER
WE MAY GATHER FROM THIS TROUBLE A SWEETNESS THAT SHALL TAKE AWAY FROM ALL SUFFERING ITS BITTERNESS
BUSTILL LETTER FROM A SLAVE SECRETED IN RICHMOND
I WOKE MY COMPANIONS UP AND TOLD THEM THAT THAT MAN HAD BETRAYED US
GARNET TO WHOM I AM SENDING A REMITTANCE FOR HIS CONTRABANDS BY THE SAME MAIL
HE KNEW VERY WELL WERE IT KNOWN THAT HE HAD THE LOVE OF FREEDOM IN HIS HEART OR THE IDEA OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN HIS HEAD HE WOULD BE REGARDED AS HAVING COMMITTED THE UNPARDONABLE SIN SO JACK LOOKED TO NONE OF THESE BROKEN REEDS IN RICHMOND IN THE HOUR OF HIS TRIAL BUT TO HIM ABOVE WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN AND TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
THE WIND BLEW FEARFULLY
HIS OWNER HAD THOUGHT ONCE OF SELLING HIM PERHAPS FEARING THAT JEREMIAH MIGHT UNLUCKILY DIE ON HIS HANDS
BUT YOU ARE TO BE SATISFIED THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE CLAIMS ARE WELL FOUNDED
SABBATH BEFORE LAST I PREACHED FROM IT ARGUING AND ILLUSTRATING THE PROPOSITION DEDUCED FROM IT THAT THE GREAT WORK TO WHICH WE ARE NOW CALLED IS THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY OR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVE SHOWING OUR DUTY AS PHILANTHROPISTS
THE ONE AT THE HEAD OF THIS REPORT IS CLEARLY OF THIS CHARACTER
NO ONE PROBABLY HAS HAD EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITH YOURSELF OF LISTENING TO THE NARRATIVES OF FUGITIVE SLAVES
HE REPLIED

BRIT ELIZABETH 136
THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
CHRISTIANS
NOT ONCE BUT FOR MORE THAN A SCORE OF TIMES HE FANCIED THE SLAVE WOULD BE DEAD
AFTER NIGHT HE WOULD COME OUT OF HIS CAVE AND IN SOME INSTANCES WOULD SUCCEED IN MAKING HIS WAY TO A PLANTATION AND IF HE COULD GET NOTHING ELSE HE WOULD HELP HIMSELF TO A PIG OR ANYTHING ELSE HE COULD CONVENIENTLY CONVERT INTO FOOD
THEY WERE THEREFORE RETAINED IN SAFE QUARTERS
AND THUS ESCORTED SHE WAS TAKEN BACK IN SAFETY TO THE HOUSE FROM WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT
AND IN A LETTER DATED AT TEMPLE MAINE OCT
BUT OH
RACHE SEES THE COW SNUFFING THE LAND BREEZE AND DARTING OFF THROUGH THE CROWD
THE BOAT THE RUNAWAYS WERE IN WAS CLAIMED IF NOT THE PARTY THEMSELVES
FLOGGING SELLING ETC WERE OF EVERY-DAY OCCURRENCE THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE SAID THAT THE FRIENDS OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE HAD BEEN FOR SOME YEARS PAST EMBARRASSED FOR THE WANT OF A PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED ACTIVE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
MR BRENT THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT UPON HIM TO BRING THIS HIGH-HANDED PROCEDURE TO THE NOTICE OF THE COURT WHERE HE RECEIVED A FEW CRUMBS OF SYMPATHY FROM THE PRO-SLAVERY SIDE OF COURSE
OF COURSE HE WAS TOO SHREWD TO GET OUT PAPERS FOR PHILADELPHIA
HOLLIS LUTHER DORSEY
THAT HE HAD BEEN RESTRAINED OF HIS LIBERTY ALL HIS LIFE BY ONE SAMUEL SIMONS WHO HAD TREATED HIM BAD ALL THE TIME THAT HE HAD HELD HIM IN HIS POSSESSION
ONCE ENLISTED HE NEVER WAVERED BUT AS LONG AS SLAVERY EXISTED BY LAW IN OUR COUNTRY HIS INFLUENCE BOTH PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY WAS EXERTED AGAINST IT
PETER HEINES EATONTOWN NORTH CAROLINA
TWO HUNDRED MILES WAS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
THEY CAME AS FAR AS BALTIMORE AND THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF COMING FARTHER NORTH TO PHILADELPHIA
SMITH SAM'L 499
JAMES MASSEY PERRY HENRY TRUSTY GEORGE RHOADS JAMES RHOADS GEORGE WASHINGTON SARAH ELIZABETH RHOADS AND CHILD MARY ELIZABETH STEPHENSON
HE WAS NOT LONG HOWEVER IN MAKING UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD DELIVER THEM OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT DELIBERATELY FORMING HIS PLANS TO GO SOUTH HE RESOLVED TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL THE RISKS TO BE ENCOUNTERED
HE HAD NOT MUCH EXCUSE TO MAKE FOR LEAVING EXCEPT THAT HE WAS TIRED OF STAYING WITH HIS OWNER AS HE FEARED HE MIGHT BE SOLD SOME DAY SO HE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE
NO GREAT WHILE BEFORE SHE ESCAPED ONE OF HER BROTHERS AND A SISTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SOUTHERN MARKET
IT SET HIM TO THINKING SERIOUSLY ON THE SUBJECT OF IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION AND WHAT A MISERABLE HARD LOT OF IT HE SHOULD HAVE THROUGH LIFE IF HE DID NOT PICK UP COURAGE AND RESOLUTION TO GET BEYOND THE TERROR OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
MISS ELIZABETH BROWN OF PORTSMOUTH VA
SHERIDAN W
OF THEIR SUBSEQUENT TRAVEL MENTION HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE IN FRIEND GARRETT'S EPISTLE
IT REQUIRED MUCH TROUBLE AS WELL AS EXPENSE TO SAVE HIM FROM THE SLAVE-TRADERS
9 MO
INFERIOR IN INTELLIGENCE HAVING NOT ONE-FIFTH OF THE NUMBER OF LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC PERIODICALS
A SLAVE NAMED SAM WAS WHIPPED TO DEATH TIED TO THE GROUND
VERY WELL SAID ROBERT TO-DAY I WILL PLEASE MY MASTER SO WELL THAT I WILL CATCH HIM AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT AND WILL ASK HIM FOR A PASS TO GO TO A BALL TO-NIGHT SLAVE-HOLDERS LOVE TO SEE THEIR SLAVES FIDDLING AND DANCING OF NIGHTS AND AS I SHALL BE LEAVING IN A HURRY I WILL TAKE A GRAB FROM THE DAY'S SALE AND WHEN SLATER HEARS OF ME AGAIN I WILL BE IN CANADA SO AFTER HAVING ATTENDED TO ALL HIS DISAGREEABLE DUTIES HE MADE HIS GRAB AND GOT A HAND FULL
ATKINS
TO-DAY AFTER THE LAPSE OF MORE THAN A GENERATION HIS MEMORY IS FRESH AND GREEN IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO KNEW HIM AND WHO STILL SURVIVE TO HAND DOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN THE STORY OF THE TRIALS OF THAT EVENTFUL PERIOD IN OUR HISTORY
INDEED IT IS AS I WELL KNOW
HIS MOTHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAD TO BE LEFT ALSO
BUT YOU NO DOUBT FEEL IT A SATISFACTION TO DO ALL YOU CAN FOR THE POOR SUFFERERS FEBRUARY 10 1858 SHE FORWARDED HER WILLING CONTRIBUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING REMARKS
COUNTENANCE PLEASANT AND INTELLECT MEDIUM
AND OWING SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR TO A CERTAIN EDWARD GORSUCH UNDER THE LAWS OF THE SAID STATE OF MARYLAND HAD ESCAPED THEREFROM INTO THE SAID EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
WILLIAMS
WILLIAMS
WILLIAMS
AT THE CORNER OF FOURTH AND WALNUT STREETS MILES IN COMPANY WITH TWO OTHER YOUNG MEN WALLACE AND MARSHALL ONE EVENING IN A MOST ORDERLY MANNER ENTERED THE CARS AND TOOK THEIR SEATS
ALTHOUGH I CANNOT SPEAK OF ANY IMMEDIATE AND POSITIVE DANGER
FOR REFUSING TO BE FLOGGED ONE TIME AT HALL'S FACTORY THE OVERSEER IN A RAGE TOOK UP A HICKORY CLUB AND LAID HIS HEAD OPEN ON EACH SIDE OVERPOWERED AND WOUNDED HE WAS STRIPPED NAKED AND COMPELLED TO RECEIVE THREE HUNDRED LASHES BY WHICH HE WAS LITERALLY EXCORIATED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
AT FIRST EVEN THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM THOUGHT THAT THE KILLING OF GORSUCH WAS NOT ONLY WRONG BUT UNFORTUNATE FOR THE CAUSE
I HAVE SEEN MR BEANS WHIP ONE OF HIS SLAVES TO DEATH AT THE TREE TO WHICH HE WAS TIED
COLSON A VERY BAD MAN FOND OF DRINKING GREAT TO FIGHT AND SWEAR AND HARD TO PLEASE HIS MISTRESS WAS REAL ROUGH
AT THIS JUNCTURE MR BIGELOW HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS NO LONGER SAFE TO WRITE OVER HIS OWN NAME BUT THAT HE WOULD DO WELL TO HENCEFORTH ADOPT THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED QUAKER WM
AMONGST OTHER QUESTIONS HE WAS ASKED
BUT THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY REMINDS ME OF HEATHEN GROUND AND THOUGH MY WORK MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF IT USED TO BE IN THE NORTH YET NEVER PERHAPS WERE MY SERVICES MORE NEEDED
I WANT TO GET THEM ON SOON TOO
I COMPLY BECAUSE THE HISTORY OF THAT STRUGGLE WOULD BE VERY INCOMPLETE IF FROM IT WERE OMITTED THE PECULIAR WORK WHICH MY FATHER'S POSITION HERE SHAPED FOR HIM
INFERIOR IN MORALS BEING THE REGION OF BOWIE KNIVES AND DUELS OF ASSASSINATIONS AND LYNCH LAW
FOR THIRTY YEARS WILLIAM HAD BEEN FOREMAN ON HIS OLD MASTER'S PLANTATION AND BUT FOR THE APPREHENSION CAUSED BY THE ILL-WILL OF HIS PROSPECTIVE YOUNG MASTERS HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE REMAINED IN SERVITUDE AT LEAST UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE OLD MAN
AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE TWO OR THREE NON-RESISTANT QUAKERS AND A NUMBER OF POOR DEFENCELESS COLORED WOMEN AMONG THOSE THUS TAKEN AS PRISONERS STILL IT SEEMED UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE EXASPERATED DEFENDERS OF SLAVERY TO DIVEST THEMSELVES OF THE IDEA THAT THIS HEROIC DEED IN SELF-DEFENCE ON THE PART OF MEN WHO FELT THAT THEIR LIBERTIES WERE IN DANGER WAS ANYTHING LESS THAN ACTUALLY LEVYING WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
THE NARRATIVES THROUGHOUT HAVE THE MARK OF TRUTH UPON THEM AND ARE BASED ON AUTHENTIC RECORDS
DINAH WAS AS WELL AS EVER AND BECAME THE MOTHER OF ANOTHER CHILD--A LITTLE BOY
THE COURT DECIDED THAT HE MUST BE SOLD IN OR OUT OF THE STATE TO SERVE FOR SEVEN YEARS
I HAVE UNDERSTOOD SIR THAT THERE WERE NO DIFFICUL ABOUT THE MONE THAT YOU HAD IT IN YOUR POSSESSION READY FOR THE BUNDLE WHENEVER IT IS DELIVERED
MOORE BOUGHT ME FROM A MAN NAMED MCCAULLY WHO OWNED ME ABOUT A YEAR
I REMAIN YOUR FRIEND IN THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY AND HUMANITY JOHN H
JOHN WAS A DARK MULATTO THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE WELL-FORMED AND INTELLIGENT
ON THE SIDE OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE FOLLOWING DISTINGUISHED COUNSEL APPEARED ON EXAMINATION
IF IT INCLUDES THE DOING OF THIS AMID A STORM OF ODIUM THAT WOULD QUICKLY HAVE SHATTERED ANY SOUL IRRESOLUTE FOR AN INSTANT
THIS WAS HASTILY DELIVERED AT THE STATION AND THE PRISONERS WERE RELEASED
SHE HAD BEEN A FAITHFUL SERVANT--HER MASTER TRIED TO SAVE HER BUT THE TIDE OF FURY SWEPT AWAY HIS EFFORTS
AT ONCE HE DECIDED THAT THE SCAR MUST BE CONCEALED AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE EXAMINATION OF THE CLAIMANT'S WITNESSES
FINALLY ONE OF THE PARTY ASKED WILLIAM WRIGHT TO PRODUCE THE MEN
ALTHOUGH A MAN OF ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE HE WAS FOREMAN OF HIS MASTER'S FARM BUT HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY FAVORED IN ANY WAY ON THIS ACCOUNT
OF POWERFUL PHYSICAL PROPORTIONS AND OF MORE THAN ORDINARY INTELLECTUAL CAPACITIES
SEVENTH AND ARCH STREETS
IF I HAD ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO DAY I WOULD GIVE THEM FIVE EACH HOWEVER I HOPE THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO SUBSCRIBE SOMETHING FOR THEIR RELEFE
THE FRACAS CAUSED SOME EXCITEMENT AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT A SHOW WAS TO BE EXHIBITED THAT DAY IN THE TOWN WHICH AS IS USUAL IN THE COUNTRY BROUGHT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE FROM A DISTANCE
IN ORDER TO MEET THIS DEMAND HE COMMONLY RESORTED TO OYSTERING
AND THEY MAINTAIN THIS MONSTROUS CLAIM BY MEASURES INHUMAN AND BARBAROUS LISTENING NOT TO THE VOICE OF REASON OR HUMANITY BUT TREATING EVERY MAN WHO GOES AMONGST THEM SUSPECTED OF NOT FAVORING THEIR CAUSE OR OF THE REMOTEST CONNECTION WITH OTHERS WHO DO NOT FAVOR IT WITH A MOST SAVAGE AND FIENDISH CRUELTY
THESE FOUR FUGITIVES WERE FULL OF ENTHUSIASM FOR CANADA ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS AMONG THE WORST ABUSED OF THEIR CLASS
IF IN THIS CASE I HAVE BEEN VERY URGENT SINCE SEPTEMBER DR T
IS THE QUESTION

DUNGY
HEZEKIAH BEING A NOTED CHARACTER A NUMBER OF THE TRUE FRIENDS WERE INVITED TO TAKE HIM BY THE HAND AND TO REJOICE WITH HIM OVER HIS NOBLE STRUGGLES AND HIS TRIUMPH
SO THEY DECIDED TO TAKE ME WITH THEM TO PHILADELPHIA FOR A SHORT VISIT BEFORE GOING INTO VIRGINIA TO BUY UP THEIR DROVE OF SLAVES FOR LOUISIANA
B.D
SHE SAYS THAT YOU WERE ALL KIND TO HER AND SHE DOES NOT FORGET IT
THIS LOSS FELL WITH CRUSHING WEIGHT UPON THE KIND-HEARTED MISTRESS AS WILL BE SEEN IN A LETTER SUBJOINED WHICH SHE WROTE TO THE UNFAITHFUL WILLIAM SOME TIME AFTER HE HAD FLED
OF COURSE HE WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF RESORTING TO THE COURTS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH HIS CLAIM
JOSEPHINE HAD FULLY THOUGHT OVER THE MATTER OF HER RIGHTS SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE
AN EXPLANATION WAS SOUGHT WHICH RESULTED IN ASCERTAINING THAT THE PARTY WAS FROM LEESBURG VIRGINIA
THE FOLLOWING NOTES IN THE MAIN WERE RECORDED FROM THEIR STATEMENTS
BOSTON JANUARY 25TH 1871
NEITHER FROM MISTRESS NOR MASTER HAD SHE ANY REASON TO EXPECT MERCY OR LENIENCY--INDEED SHE SAW NO WAY OF ESCAPE BUT BY THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD MISTRESS BUT GEORGE WAS NOT A VERY HAPPY AND CONTENTED PIECE OF PROPERTY AS WAS PROVED BY HIS COURSE IN ESCAPING
BROKE JAIL JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE
SETH CONCKLIN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD LETTERS
THOMAS SIPPLE AND HIS WIFE MARY ANN HENRY BURKETT AND ELIZABETH HIS WIFE JOHN PURNELL AND HALE BURTON
I CAN ALSO GIVE A FEW PARTICULARS OF THE ESCAPE OF THE GORSUCH MURDERERS FROM NORRISTOWN ON THEIR WAY TO CANADA
LIKE THE KEY TO UNCLE TOM'S CABIN BY MRS STOWE IT REVEALS MANY OF THE MOST THRILLING PERSONAL DRAMAS AND TRAGEDIES IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF SLAVERY
JUST LOOK AFTER ALL THE TRIALS DEEP AND FIERY THROUGH WHICH THE NATION HAS WADED HOW MOURNFULLY SUGGESTIVE WAS THE RESPONSE THE PROCLAMATION RECEIVED FROM THE DEMOCRATIC TRIUMPHS WHICH FOLLOWED SO CLOSE UPON ITS FOOTSTEPS
EVANSVILLE INDIANA MARCH 31ST 1851
JOSEPH WAS A MARRIED MAN AND SPOKE TENDERLY OF HIS WIFE
MOUNTAINS OF DIFFICULTIES AND MONTHS OF SUFFERING AND PRIVATIONS BY LAND AND WATER IN THE WOODS AND SWAMPS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA WERE BEFORE HIM AS HIS EXPERIENCE IN TRAVELING PROVED
HE WAS TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN HE SEEMED
TWO CASES NOT WRITTEN OUT FOR WANT OF TIME THE BOYS ALLUDED TO AS HAVING BEEN FOUND C WERE FREE-BORN BUT HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED AND CARRIED SOUTH AND SOLD
THE TRIAL OF THE CASES 1848
HIS APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF EXTRA PHYSICAL POWERS AT LEAST ONE NOT LIKELY TO TURN HIS FACE AGAIN TOWARDS EGYPT
THEN THE VARIOUS MECHANICAL TRADES WERE NECESSARILY GIVEN TO THE SLAVES FOR THE MASTER HAD NO TASTE FOR GREASY NORTHERN MECHANICS THEN AGAIN THE STORES HAD TO BE SUPPLIED WITH PORTERS DRAYMEN ETC FROM THE SLAVE POPULATION
IT WAS TOLERABLY WELL WRITTEN AND PROMPT
BORN IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE REVOLUTION AND GROWING UP SURROUNDED BY SUCH INFLUENCES DANIEL GIBBONS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OTHER THAN HE WAS THE FRIEND OF THE DOWN-TRODDEN AND OPPRESSED OF EVERY NATIONALITY AND COLOR
IF TAKEN IN A SLAVE STATE I WILL GIVE $200 EACH FOR THEIR RECOVERY
THE 30 1858
NO WHITE BLOOD SHOWED ITSELF IN THE LEAST IN THIS INDIVIDUAL
HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE OF DARK CHESTNUT COLOR MEDIUM SIZE AND OF PLEASANT MANNERS TO SAY THE LEAST
FROM THE WILMINGTON DAILY COMMERCIAL PUBLISHED BY JENKINS AND ATKINSON MEN FULLY INSPIRED WITH THE SPIRIT OF IMPARTIAL FREEDOM WE COPY THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WHICH IS REGARDED BY HIS RELATIVES AND INTIMATE ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS AS A FAITHFUL PORTRAITURE OF HIS CHARACTER AND LABORS
THY FRIEND THOS
FOREMAN ISAAC 559
OH GOD HELP I PRAY WHAT A PITTY IT IS THAT I CANNOT DO HIM NO GOOD BUT I SINCERELY HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT GET FATIGUED AT DOING GOOD IN SUCH CASES NAY I THINK OTHER WISES OF YOU HOWEVER I SAY NO MORE ON THIS SUBJECT AT PRESENT BUT LEAVE IT FOR YOU TO JUDGE
J.P
CONSEQUENTLY HE CONCLUDED TO LEAVE THE PLACE ALTOGETHER
HENRY CHAMBERS JOHN CHAMBERS SAMUEL FALL AND THOMAS ANDERSON MD
BUT AT THAT TIME COTTON WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE KING--THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW WAS SUPREME AND THE NOTORIOUS DECISION OF JUDGE TANEY THAT BLACK MEN HAD NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT ECHOED THE PREJUDICES OF THE MASSES TOO CLEARLY TO HAVE MADE IT SAFE TO REVEAL THE FACT OF THEIR ARRIVAL OR EVEN THE HEART-RENDING CONDITION OF THESE FUGITIVES
WHEN HE REACHED THE PHILADELPHIA STATION HE FELT THAT THE DAY DAWNED HIS JOY WAS FULL DESPITE THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
ONE REASON IS THAT ALTHOUGH DEAR BETSY'S INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WAS QUITE EQUAL IN EARNESTNESS IT WAS NOT QUITE SO ABSORBINGLY EXCLUSIVE
OUR FRIEND MINKINS IN WHOSE BEHALF WILLIAM ASKS THE UNITED PRAYERS OF HIS FRIENDS WAS ONE OF THE SCOUNDRELS WHO ASSISTED HIM AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS TO ESCAPE ON THE STEAMER
IN THE HEALTHY AIR OF FREEDOM SHE WAS SOON FULLY RESTORED AND READY TO TAKE HER DEPARTURE FOR NEW BEDFORD WHICH PLACE SHE REACHED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND WAS CORDIALLY WELCOMED
THE INTEREST ARISING FROM THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MENTIONED IN SECOND ITEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATING COLORED CHILDREN IN CANADA IS INTENDED TO REMAIN PERPETUAL
MARY WAS TWENTY YEARS OF AGE OF A CHESTNUT COLOR USUAL SIZE AND WELL DISPOSED
WHAT KIND OF A MAN WAS WILLIAM PARKER THEY WERE ASKED
5 A VESSEL SO INSPECTED AND GETTING UNDER WAY WITH INTENT TO LEAVE THE WATERS OF THE STATE IF SHE RETURNS TO AN ANCHORAGE ABOVE BACK RIVER POINT OR WITHIN OLD POINT COMFORT SHALL BE AGAIN INSPECTED AND CHARGED AS IF AN ORIGINAL CASE
IT WAS IN 1836 IN ONE OF HIS VACATIONS THAT HIS MIND WAS VIOLENTLY TURNED INWARDS TO RE-EXAMINE HIS STATUS UPON THE ANTI-SLAVERY QUESTION
CATHARINES CANADA WEST 24TH JULY 1854
I THINK HENRY YOU HAVE ACTED MOST DISHONORABLY
FOR ALL THESE WE FEEL DEEPLY INTERESTED
HAVING THUS ESCAPED BY THE SKIN OF HIS TEETH HE NEVER AGAIN VENTURED SOUTH
BY MUTUAL ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE CLAIMANTS AND THE PRISONER'S COUNSEL THE HEARING WAS FIXED FOR THE NEXT DAY AT THE HOUR OF THREE O'CLOCK

PENNINGTON PETER 272
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF PEACEFUL LIFE THERE SHE WAS ONE DAY ALARMED NOT BY THE HEIRS OF HER DEAD MASTER BUT BY THE LOATHED MORT CUNNINGHAM WHO WITHOUT THE SHADOW OF LEGAL RIGHT HAD COME TO CARRY HER BACK TO SLAVERY
THEN I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD MAKE LESS DO THOMAS HAD BEEN HIRED OUT AT THE NATIONAL HOTEL FOR THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH
AFTER WHICH A BRIEF GLANCE AT SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT POINTS OF THE CASE MUST SUFFICE
THAT SHE WROTE THE LETTER COULD NOT BE PROVED BUT THAT IT WAS SENT BY HER CONSENT THERE WAS NO DOUBT
THERE ARE TWO SMALL BOXES AND TWO LARGE ONES
FOR INSTANCE IN TRAVELING THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF STOPPING REPEATEDLY AT HOTELS AND THAT THE CUSTOM OF REGISTERING WOULD HAVE TO BE CONFORMED TO UNLESS SOME VERY GOOD EXCUSE COULD BE GIVEN FOR NOT DOING SO
CROMWELL HENRY 259
A SECOND VISIT TO ENGLAND IN 1847 HAD ENLARGED HIS CONNECTION AND CORRESPONDENCE WITH ANTI-SLAVERY FRIENDS THERE AND IN ADDITION TO HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS VERY CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY WERE TRANSMITTED TO HIM ESPECIALLY THROUGH A.H
THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT HE HAD TO MAKE AGAINST HIS MISTRESS WAS THAT SHE HIRED HIM TO A MAN NAMED SMITH A FARMER AND A SLAVE-HOLDER OF THE MEANEST TYPE IN WILLIAM'S OPINION

IN JUMPING HE PUT ONE KNEE OUT OF JOINT

ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--THIS IS MY 69TH BIRTH-DAY AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY BETTER WAY TO CELEBRATE IT IN A WAY TO ACCORD WITH MY FEELINGS THAN TO SEND TO THEE TWO FUGITIVES MAN AND WIFE

ALBERTI TO WHOM YOU ADDRESSED A NOTE THIS MORNING
DAVID HAD SUFFERED MANY HARDSHIPS AT THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER BUT WHEN THE AUCTION-BLOCK WAS HELD UP TO HIM THAT WAS THE WORST CUT OF ALL
WHEN THE QUESTION CAME UP THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE PROPOSITION TO DISBAND WAS EARNESTLY SUPPORTED BY MR GARRISON MR QUINCY MR MAY MR JOHNSON AND OTHERS BUT WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED BY WENDELL PHILLIPS AND HIS FRIENDS AMONG WHOM FROM PHILADELPHIA WERE MRS MOTT MISS GREW AND ROBERT PURVIS AND WAS DECIDED BY A VOTE IN THE NEGATIVE

TREMBLING AT HIS IMPENDING DOOM HE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE IF POSSIBLE
WHEN TIMES BECAME SO HARD THAT SHE COULD NOT STAND HER OLD MISTRESS SALLY ANY LONGER SHE TOOK OUT HARRIET DID NOT COME IN COMPANY WITH ELIZA JANE BUT BY ACCIDENT THEY MET AT THE STATION IN PHILADELPHIA

MY MISTRESS WAS A METHODIST BUT SHE SEEMED TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GOODNESS
CAPTAIN LAMBDIN IS DESIROUS OF HAVING SENT HIM A BOOK OR BOOKS WITH THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS OF THE NOTED MEN OF THE SOUTH AGAINST THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY AS HE WISHES TO PREPARE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AS HE HAS LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS ATTORNEY
UPON REFLECTION THEREFORE ARCHER THOUGHT IF HE HAD JUSTICE DONE HIM HE WOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THIS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HIMSELF AND ALL HIS OTHER RIGHTS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TOIL FOR ANOTHER WITHOUT PAY

OH WAS IT NOT DREADFUL

IF YOU WISH TO DO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE YOU WILL SEND ME FIFTY DOLLARS IN A LETTER TO PRINCETON GIBSON COUNTY INDA SO AS TO ARRIVE THERE BY THE 8TH OF MARCH
WILLIAM WAS OF A DARK COLOR STOUT MADE PHYSICALLY AND WELL KNEW THE VALUE OF FREEDOM AND HOW TO HATE AND COMBAT SLAVERY
AND I TOOK AN EPITAPH FROM IT TO PUT ON THE TOMBSTONE
WILLIAM ELLIOTT CLAIMED THE RIGHT TO FLOG AND USED IT TOO
HE HAD TAKEN PART IN THE CEREMONIES AT THE RECOVERY OF SUMTER HAD WALKED THE STREETS OF CHARLESTON AND RECEIVED FLORAL TOKENS OF THE GRATITUDE OF THE EMANCIPATED

AS HIS MASTER HAD ALWAYS DECLARED THAT IF ONE RUN OFF HE WOULD SELL THE REST TO GEORGIA GEORGE VERY WISELY CONCLUDED THAT AS AN EFFORT WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE THEY HAD BETTER LEAVE THEIR MASTER WITH AS FEW AS POSSIBLE TO BE TROUBLED WITH SELLING CONSEQUENTLY A CONSULTATION WAS HAD BETWEEN THE BROTHERS WHICH RESULTED IN THE EXIT OF A PARTY OF EIGHT
HAVING WAITED IN VAIN FOR HIS FREE PAPERS FOR FOUR YEARS HE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS TO BE DEALT WITH IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO MANY OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN WILLED FREE OR WHO HAD BOUGHT THEIR TIME AND HAD BEEN SHAMEFULLY CHEATED OUT OF THEIR FREEDOM

BUT HE HAD PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND A DETERMINED MIND AND BEING HEARTILY SICK OF SLAVERY HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE THE TRIAL EVEN AT THE COST OF LIFE
I LEFT AFTER THAT AND WHEN I CAME BACK THE HOUSE WAS FULLER THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND MY HOSTESS GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WOULD RATHER I SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I LEFT AGAIN
HENRY ANDERSON ALIAS WILLIAM ANDERSON
THE BROTHERS WERE HALE-LOOKING FELLOWS AND WOULD HAVE COMMANDED HIGH PRICES IN ANY MARKET SOUTH OF MASON AND DIXON'S LINE
SO HE RESOLVED TO FLEE
MY HUSBAND WISHED HER BY ALL MEANS TO BE BROUGHT TO OUR HOUSE AND TO REMAIN UNDER HIS PROTECTION SAYING I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO MEET THE PENALTY SHOULD SHE BE FOUND HERE BUT WILL NEVER GIVE HER UP THE PENALTY YOU REMEMBER WAS SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS FINE
WHICH HE DID NOT ASK OR CARE
OUT OF THE WINDOW JUMPED TWO OF THE FEMALE FUGITIVES
ONCE OR TWICE IN THE YEAR WAS ALL THE PRIVILEGE ALLOWED HIM TO VISIT HER
BUT THEY HAD REASON TO FEAR THAT THEY WERE IN DANGER
THE NUMBER OF CASES REPORTED IS VERY LARGE AND THE METHOD IN WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DONE HIS WORK IS COMMENDABLE
JOHN FRANKLY CONFESSED TO THE CREDIT OF THE DOCTOR THAT HE GOT A PLENTY TO EAT DRINK AND WEAR YET HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN A SLAVE HE HAD HIGHER AIMS
OWING TO HER UNEXPECTED DEATH I GOT RID OF THAT MUCH WHICH WAS OF SOME CONSEQUENCE AS I WAS A SLAVE MYSELF AND HAD HARD WORK TO RAISE THE MONEY TO PURCHASE HER THUS FINDING THE USAGES OF SLAVERY SO CRUEL AND OUTLANDISH HE RESOLVED TO LEAVE OLD VIRGINNY AND TOOK OUT VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
PERSONALLY I KNOW NOTHING OF THE FACTS OR THE EVIDENCE RELATING TO THEM
HIRAM WILSON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT AT ST CATHARINES C.W DULY ANNOUNCED HIS SAFE ARRIVAL AS FOLLOWS

BUT WE OUTWITTED THEM AT LAST TO THEIR GREAT CHAGRIN
I TOLD ALL ABOUT IT

SHE LEAVES THIS MORNING WITH HER CHILD FOR NORFOLK TO BE AT THE TRIAL BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER ON THE 24TH INSTANT

EMINENT ANTI-SLAVERY MEN ILLUSTRATION
HEAR HEAR WHEN I READ THAT ARTICLE BY HARRIET MARTINEAU AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THERE GIVEN I WAS LED I KNOW NOT HOW TO THINK OF A VERY STRIKING PASSAGE WHICH I AM SURE MUST BE FAMILIAR TO MOST HERE BECAUSE IT IS TO BE FOUND IN THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS
HENRY IS ABOUT 22 YEARS OLD FIVE FEET TEN INCHES HIGH OF DARK CHESTNUT COLOR AND LARGE FRONT TEETH
HE ALLOWED HIS SLAVES TO RAISE FOWL AND HOGS WITH MANY PRIVILEGES OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
THEY ALL LEFT THEIR HOME OR RATHER ESCAPED FROM THE PRISON-HOUSE ON EASTER SUNDAY AND CAME VIA HARRISBURG WHERE THEY WERE ASSISTED AND DIRECTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
AS THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST I CONCLUDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FIND THEM IN SO LARGE A CITY
I WANTED TO DIE A FREE MAN IF IT PLEASED GOD TO HAVE IT SO HIS WIFE AND A GROWN-UP SON HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE AS NO OPPORTUNITY OFFERED TO BRING THEM AWAY WITH HIM
THAT THE OLD COMMITTEE WHICH USED TO RENDER EFFECTIVE SERVICE IN THIS FIELD OF ANTI-SLAVERY LABOR HAD BECOME DISORGANIZED AND SCATTERED AND THAT FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS THE DUTIES OF THIS DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SOMETIMES IN A VERY IRREGULAR MANNER
GENERAL ANDREW WAS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE A FULL BLACK AND A MAN OF EXTRAORDINARY MUSCULAR POWERS WITH COARSE HARD FEATURES SUCH AS SHOWED SIGNS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE FOR HIS MASTER TO MEDDLE WITH HIM WHEN THE GENERAL'S BLOOD WAS UP
THE COMMITTEE REGARDED HIM AS A REMARKABLE MAN AND WAS MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HIS STORY AND FELT IT TO BE A PRIVILEGE AND A PLEASURE TO AID HIM
I SAW A COLORED GENTLEMAN COME ON BOARD HE BECKONED TO ME
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE MAYOR AND HIS OFFICERS ASSEMBLED IN FRONT OF THE HALL AND BY PROMPT AND ENERGETIC ACTION SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE MOB AND THROUGH THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THOMAS SHIPLEY THE RINGLEADERS WERE SECURED AND LODGED IN PRISON

WILLIAM STILL ESQ.:--DEAR SIR--I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YOU FOR SOME TIME
BEN WAS ALSO A SLAVE IN NORTH CAROLINA--LOCATED AT EATONTOWN BEING THE PROPERTY OF MISS ANN BLUNT WHO WAS VERY HARD IN SLAVE PROPERTY MISS BLUNT WAS INTERESTED TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT NINETY HEAD SHE WAS MUCH IN THE HABIT OF HIRING OUT SERVANTS AND IN THUS DISPOSING OF HER SLAVES BEN THOUGHT SHE WAS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONCERNED IN GETTING GOOD PRICES FOR HERSELF THAN GOOD PLACES FOR THEM
MANY OF THE NARRATIVES THRILL THE READER THROUGH AND THROUGH
A MAN OF ORDINARY NERVE WOULD HAVE DECLINED THIS CONDITION UNHESITATINGLY

HOUSTON OF HAVING RESTRAINED HIM OF HIS LIBERTY AND TESTIFIED THAT SAID HOUSTON WAS A VERY BAD MAN
AND SOME TIME AFTER BECOMING NATURALIZED IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS HE WROTE THAT HE WAS A BRAKESMAN ON THE GREAT WESTERN R.R IN CANADA--PROMOTED FROM THE U.G.R.R THE RESULT OF BEING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE BRITISH LION
ERE THE MORNING SUN AROSE THE SAD NEWS WAS BORNE BY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OF THIS AWFUL CALAMITY ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE TOOK ESPECIAL PLEASURE IN AIDING HIM AND LISTENING TO SO REMARKABLE A STORY NARRATED SO INTELLIGENTLY BY ONE WHO HAD BEEN A SLAVE
HE HOWEVER DID NOT WISH HER ANY EVIL BUT HE WAS VERY DECIDED THAT HE DID NOT WANT ANY MORE TO DO WITH HER

HE IS THIRTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF DARK COMPLEXION WELL MADE GOOD-LOOKING READS AND WRITES IS VERY FLUENT IN SPEECH AND REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT
HE FELT AS A HUSBAND SHOULD TOWARDS HIS WIFE BETSY AND LIKEWISE LOVED HIS CHILDREN WALTER AND MARY BUT THESE BELONGED TO ANOTHER MAN WHO LIVED SOME DISTANCE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HE HAD PERMISSION TO SEE THEM ONLY ONCE A WEEK
I PUT ON RIGHTEOUSNESS AND IT CLOTHED ME
BESIDES IN THE ALLOWANCE OF FOOD AND CLOTHING HE ALWAYS STINTED THE SLAVES YET WORKED THEM VERY HARD SAM'S CHANCES FOR EDUCATION HAD BEEN VERY UNFAVORABLE BUT HE HAD MIND ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT LIBERTY WAS WORTH STRUGGLING FOR
THEY GREATLY NEEDED FOOD CLOTHING REST AND MONEY WHICH THEY FREELY RECEIVED AND WERE AFTERWARDS FORWARDED TO JOHN W
THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE AS THIS PASSENGER DID NOT REACH THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA YET TO EXCLUDE HIM ON THIS ACCOUNT WOULD BE DOING AN INJUSTICE TO HISTORY
THE KENNETT ABOLITIONISTS HAVING TAKEN HIM IN HAND AND FEARING THAT SUSPICIOUS EYES WERE ON HIM IN THEIR REGION FELT IT NECESSARY TO SEND HIM ONWARD WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIS WOUND TO HEAL
THEIR THREE CHRISTIAN PASTORS TOOK THE SAME COURSE
THIS WAS ON THE SIXTH DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH 1756

THAT HE SHALL TAKE IN COAL FOR WASHINGTON AND COME DIRECTLY HERE--SELL HIS COAL AND GO TO GEORGETOWN FOR FREIGHT AND WAIT FOR IT
THE HIGHEST EVIDENCE OF A SOUND FAITH BEING THE PRACTICAL LIFE OF THE CHRISTIAN I HAVE FELT A FAR GREATER INTEREST IN THE MORAL MOVEMENTS OF OUR AGE THAN IN ANY THEOLOGICAL DISCUSSION HER LIFE IS A NOBLE EVIDENCE OF THE SINCERITY OF THIS BELIEF

AFTER I GROWED UP TO BE A WOMAN MY MASTER THOUGHT NOTHING OF TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF AND WOULD WHIP ME UNTIL THE BLOOD WOULD RUN DOWN TO THE GROUND
STILL DEAR FRIEND:--IN THY FIRST LETTER THEE ASKED FOR MY PHOTOGRAPH AS WELL AS FOR AN OPINION OF THE BOOK ABOUT TO BE EDITED BY THYSELF
AND BROKE THE BREECH OF THAT OVER MY HEAD
THE COMMITTEE'S RESPECT FOR HIM WAS NOT A LITTLE INCREASED WHEN THEY HEARD HIM EXPRESS HIMSELF
THAT IN THE FUTURE SLAVERY SHALL ONLY BE REMEMBERED AS A THING OF THE PAST THAT SHALL NEVER HAVE THE FAINTEST HOPE OF A RESURRECTION UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE SPOKEN OF MRS HARPER AS A LABORER BATTLING FOR FREEDOM UNDER SLAVERY AND THE WAR
I HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO DICTATE MUCH MORE ALTHOUGH MANY OTHER INSTANCES OCCUR TO ME OF MOST REMARKABLE PROVIDENTIAL OCCURRENCES OF THE ESCAPE OF FUGITIVES WITHIN MY KNOWLEDGE
HERE IS A GATHERING
FROM EXPOSURE IN THE COLD HE WAS SEVERELY FROST-BITTEN
THE DAILY DARKENING PROSPECTS CONSTRAINED HER TO DECIDE THAT SHE WAS WILLING TO SUFFER NOT ONLY IN ADOPTING THIS MODE OF TRAVEL BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT SHE HAD BETTER BE DEAD THAN REMAIN UNDER SO CRUEL A WOMAN AS HER MISTRESS
I CANNOT DOUBT I DO NOT BUT THAT YOU WISH TO HELP ME AND THE CAUSE TOO FOR WHICH BOTH OF US HAVE MADE MANY AND LARGE SACRIFICES WITH NO HOPE OF REWARD IN THIS WORLD

THE AMBITIOUS MILES COMMENCED BUSINESS IN CHELSEA NEAR BOSTON WHERE HE PURCHASED HIMSELF A COMFORTABLE HOME
THAT HE CAME IN GOOD ORDER AND WAS AIDED AND SENT OFF WAS FULLY ENOUGH STATED ON THE BOOK BUT NOTHING ELSE
SHE LET ON TO BE VERY GOOD I AM ONE OF A FAMILY OF SIXTEEN
HE KNEW THE CAPTAINS WHO WERE THEN IN THE HABIT OF TAKING SIMILAR PASSENGERS BUT HE HAD SOME FEARS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE THE BUSINESS MUCH LONGER
SHE WAS NOT IN THE FAMILY WAY WHEN SHE CAME THERE
A FEW ACRES TO TILL FOR FOOD AND A ROOF HOWEVER BUMBLE OVER YOUR HEAD ARE THE CASTLE OF YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT YOU ARE FORTIFIED TO ACT AND VOTE INDEPENDENTLY WHENEVER YOUR INTERESTS ARE AT STAKE THAT PART OF HER LECTURE AND THERE WAS MUCH OF IT THAT DWELT ON THE MORAL DUTIES AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS OF THE COLORED PEOPLE WAS PITCHED ON THE HIGHEST KEY OF SOUND MORALITY
THE OTHER QUOTATION IS FROM THE PEN OF A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE AND INTELLIGENT LADY BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS OR QUAKERS AND A MOST DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE SLAVE WHOSE STATEMENT OBVIOUSLY IS LITERALLY TRUE
HOPPER THE COMPACT WELL-KNIT FIGURE OF A QUAKER GENTLEMAN APPARENTLY ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE DRESSED IN DRAB OR BROWN CLOTHES OF THE PLAINEST CUT AND BEARING ON HIS HANDSOME MANLY FACE THE IMPRESS OF THAT BENEVOLENCE WITH WHICH HIS WHOLE HEART WAS FILLED

WHY SHOULD IT NOT SHINE
A LITTLE CHILD OF FOURTEEN MONTHS OLD WAS CONVEYED TO ITS MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO FLEE WITHOUT IT NEARLY NINE MONTHS AGO WHILE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE COMING OF THIS SLAVE CHILD WERE DEEPLY INTERESTING NO FURTHER PARTICULARS THAN THE SIMPLE NOTICE ABOVE WERE AT THAT TIME RECORDED

BUT HE WAS GOOD AT CONCEALING HIS FEELINGS AND OBVIOUSLY MANAGED TO AVOID SUSPICION
A FEW MOMENTS CONVERSATION WITH HER HOWEVER CONVINCED HIM OF HER GOOD SENSE AND DECISION OF PURPOSE WITH REGARD TO THIS MATTER
EVEN IF HE CANNOT READ HE WILL WANT IT FOR HIS CHILDREN
ARRIVES WITH NINE PASSENGERS
ARRIVES WITH NINE PASSENGERS
IN FACT THE SEVENTH OF JULY HAD BEEN AGREED UPON WHEN HE WAS TO BE IN RICHMOND TO TAKE HIS PLACE WITH OTHERS IN THE MARKET ON SALE DAY
IT WAS FIVE MILES FROM A TURNPIKE ROAD WITH QUITE A POPULATION AROUND IT FOR A SLAVE STATE IN ONE OF MR FEE'S LETTERS HE INTRODUCES A SUBJECT WHICH WE WISH ESPECIALLY TO BRING BEFORE OUR FRIENDS FEELING ALMOST SURE THAT MANY OF THEM WILL RESPOND TO ITS IMPORTANCE
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING OF WILLIS JOHNSON MR MRS HILL SEND THEIR KIND LOVE TO YOU THEY ARE ALL WELL NO MORE AT PRESENT FROM YOUR AFFECT JOHN HALL NORTONS HOTEL
ON ONE OCCASION WHEN THE MINISTER WAS VISITING MISS C THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY WAS INTRODUCED IN JOHN'S HEARING
RODGERS CHAS
IN THE MEANTIME HIS MOTHER WHO WAS A SLAVE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE ALSO BUT AFTER ONE WEEK'S GLOOMY FOREBODING SHE BECAME FAINT-HEARTED AND GAVE THE STRUGGLE OVER BUT JOSEPH DID NOT KNOW WHAT SURRENDER MEANT
BUT IN CONVERSING WITH HIM THEY FOUND HIM POSSESSED OF MORE INTELLIGENCE THAN THEY HAD SUPPOSED
FULL OLD ENOUGH TO FEEL DEEPLY THE LOSS OF HIS MOTHER BUT WITHOUT HOPE OF EVER SEEING HER AGAIN
AFTER THAT ALL THE SATISFACTION THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE DOCTOR WAS SIMPLY TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD HIRED HIM TO MR MORRISON FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR
AN OCCASIONAL RURAL RESIDENCE OF OURS FIVE MILES FROM HOME TO WILLIAM STILL:--I HAVE AGAIN TO THANK THEE DEAR FRIEND FOR A KIND LETTER AND FOR THE PERUSAL OF THREE LETTERS FROM THY FUGITIVE FRIENDS
BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE DECLARED THAT HE WAS VERY HARD ON HIS SERVANTS ALLOWING THEM NO CHANCE WHATEVER TO MAKE A LITTLE READY MONEY FOR THEMSELVES SO IN TURNING HIS FACE TOWARDS THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND HIS BACK AGAINST SLAVERY HE FELT THAT HE WAS DOING GOD SERVICE
I HERE READ AND SEE HUMAN NATURE UNDER NEW LIGHTS AND PHASES
ON ARRIVING IN CANADA HE MANIFESTED HIS GRATITUDE THROUGH REV
IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RENEWAL OF THESE INFLICTIONS HE RESORTED TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WITH HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE HAD ONLY BEEN MARRIED SIX MONTHS

IN FACT JOHN THOUGHT THAT HIS OWNER WAS SUCH A STRANGE WICKED AND CROSS CHARACTER THAT HE COULDN'T TELL HIMSELF WHAT HE WAS
THE BIG WOMAN AGAIN TRIED TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE BUT IN VAIN
HENCE THE AUTHOR OF THE KIDNAPPED AND THE RANSOMED WAS COMPELLED TO OMIT THESE DANGEROUS FACTS AND HAD TO CONFINE HERSELF STRICTLY TO THE PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF PETER STILL WITH REGARD TO HIS BEING KIDNAPPED LIKEWISE IN THE SKETCH OF SETH CONCKLIN'S EVENTFUL LIFE WRITTEN BY DR W.H
GOD GRANT IT MAY WORK OUT A GREAT GOOD I WANT TO GET STARTED AGAIN AS SOON AS I POSSIBLY CAN
HENRY ALIAS JOHN WESLEY 310

LIKE MANY ANOTHER ESCAPING FROM THE RELENTLESS TYRANT CHARLES COULD CONTRIVE METHODS WHICH TO HIS VENTURESOME MIND WOULD AFFORD HOPE HOWEVER DESPERATE THEY MIGHT APPEAR TO OTHERS
HE DID SO
QUOTED SCRIPTURE JUSTIFYING SLAVERY AND FINALLY SUGGESTED THAT HE THE COLORED MAN WOULD BE DOING A DUTY AND A KINDNESS TO THE FUGITIVE BY USING HIS INFLUENCE TO FIND HER AND PREVAIL UPON HER TO RETURN IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE COLORED MAN THUS ADDRESSED WAS THOMAS DORSEY THE WELL-KNOWN FASHIONABLE CATERER OF PHILADELPHIA WHO HAD HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A SLAVE AT THE SOUTH,--HAD HIMSELF ONCE BEEN PURSUED AS A FUGITIVE AND HAVING BY HIS INDUSTRY IN THE CONDITION OF FREEDOM ACQUIRED A HANDSOME ESTATE HE FELT ENTIRELY QUALIFIED TO REPLY TO THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN WHICH HE DID THOUGH IN NOT VERY RESPECTFUL PHRASES TELLING HIM THAT CORDELIA HAD AS GOOD A RIGHT TO HER LIBERTY AS HE HAD OR HER MISTRESS EITHER

LETTER FROM HAM EGGS SLAVE U.G.R.R
BUT NOW GOD BE PRAISED SHE IS FREE FREE TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
HE SNAPPED HIS PISTOL AT HIM BUT IT DID NOT GO OFF
HE CAME ACCREDITED BY ALL THE CLAIMS OF FINISHED CULTURE A MAN CONSECRATED TO THE SCHOLAR'S LIFE.[A THEN WITH THE SENSITIVENESS THAT SPRINGS FROM INTELLECTUAL BREEDING ONE WILL LOOK TO SEE HIM SHRINK FROM CONFLICT WITH THE CALLOUS CONDITION OF FEELING AROUND HIM
HE LEFT HIS FATHER MOTHER TWO BROTHERS AND THREE SISTERS OWNED BY MARCUS DEVOE
CALLED ME INTO HIS DINING-ROOM LOCKED THE DOORS THEN ORDERED ME TO PULL OFF MY SHIRT
UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER DEATH VISITED THE OLD MASTER ERE HE HAD MADE PROVISION FOR HIS SLAVES
I FEEL VERY THANKFUL TO YOU INDEED
IN SYRACUSE FRANK THE LEADER WHO WAS ENGAGED TO EMILY CONCLUDED THAT THE KNOT MIGHT AS WELL BE TIED ON THE U.G.R.R ALTHOUGH PENNILESS AS TO DELAY THE MATTER A SINGLE DAY LONGER
HENRY A LARGE SLAVE-HOLDER AND A VERY HARD ONE IF WHAT WILLIAM ALLEGED OF HIM WAS TRUE
HIS MASTER AS HE SAID HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF TYING HIM UP BY THE HANDS AND FLOGGING HIM UNMERCIFULLY
KISS YOUR DEAR LITTLE CHILDREN FOR ME
I HOPE SHE MAY LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS LONGER AND ENJOY GOOD HEALTH
LLOYD HAD TOILED ON UNTIL HE HAD REACHED FIFTY-FIVE BEFORE HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE COULD ENDURE THE TREATMENT OF HIS MASTER JOHN GRIFFIN NO LONGER SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT GOOD TO FEED AND CLOTHE AND WAS A GREAT FIGHTER MOREOVER HE WOULD NEVER SUFFER HIS SLAVES TO STOP WORK ON ACCOUNT OF BAD WEATHER NOT ONLY WAS HIS MASTER CRUEL IN THESE PARTICULARS BUT HE WAS EQUALLY CRUEL WITH REGARD TO SELLING

I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT THE FACT ALLEGED BY THE CLAIMANT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHEN THE WITNESSES WITHOUT MARK OR PECULIARITY TESTIFY THAT THEY CAN READILY RECOGNIZE THE GIRL OF FIFTEEN IN THE WOMAN OF FORTY
SO WHEN AN OPENING PRESENTED ITSELF BY WHICH HE THOUGHT HE COULD BETTER HIS CONDITION HE WAS READY TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT
BUT THE VALUE OF MRS MOTT'S ANTI-SLAVERY WORK IS NOT LIMITED TO WHAT SHE INDIVIDUALLY DID GREAT AS THAT LABOR WAS
HE HAD ON WHEN LAST SEEN ON WEST RIVER A CLOSE-BODIED BLUE CLOTH COAT WITH BRASS BUTTONS DRAB PANTALOONS AND A LOW CROWN AND VERY NARROW BRIM BEAVER HAT

HE INNOCENTLY CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING NO HARM IN AVAILING HIMSELF NOT ONLY OF HIS GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS BUT OF THE RIGHTS THAT HE HAD ALSO PURCHASED BY THE HARD TOIL OF HIS OWN HANDS
IT WAS TO GET ON THE TOP OF THE CAR INSTEAD OF INSIDE OF IT AND THUS RIDE OF NIGHTS TILL NEARLY DAYLIGHT WHEN AT A STOPPING-PLACE ON THE ROAD HE WOULD SLIP OFF THE CAR AND CONCEAL HIMSELF IN THE WOODS UNTIL UNDER COVER OF THE NEXT NIGHT HE COULD MANAGE TO GET ON THE TOP OF ANOTHER CAR

OBEYING THE DICTATES OF HIS FEELINGS HE WENT TO THE WOODS
THEY CAN'T BE PLEASED YET MARY HAD NOT FARED HALF SO HARD UNDER THE HARDINGS AS MANY SLAVES HAD UNDER THEIR CLAIMANTS

I LIVED WITH LATTA MYSELF AND THE CORNISH WHO IS NOW A MINISTER LIVED THERE
TAKING OFFENCE AT THIS STEP BOTH MUTUALLY RESOLVED TO RUN AWAY AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY

YOU WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF JANE JOHNSON I HOPE AND NOT LET HER GET KIDNAPPED BACK TO SLAVERY
HIS PASSAGE COST ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THUS AFTER CONSULTING WITH HER ON THE MATTER HER APPROVAL WAS SOON OBTAINED SHE BEING TOO PRUDENT AND WISE TO REFUSE THE HAND OF ONE WHO HAD PROVED HIMSELF SO TRUE A FRIEND TO FREEDOM AS WELL AS SO DEVOTED TO HER
AND THE CAUSE WHICH I KNEW NOT I SEARCHED OUT
PLEASE WRITE TO ME SOMETIMES
HE CAME
THE SCHOOLING WHICH CHARLES HAD BEEN RECEIVING A NUMBER OF WEEKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MOST FEARFUL LOOKING-FOR OF THE THREATENED WRATH OF THE TRADER MADE IT MUCH EASIER FOR HIM THAN FOR HER TO SEE HOW HE COULD BE PROVIDED FOR
HE SAID THAT HE COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH THE DOCTOR BUT HE COULD NOT GET ALONG WITH MRS LOBER
I HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS IN THIS CONDITION
IT PROVED AN EVER-FRESH SPRING OF VIGOR TO MY FATHER AND BECAUSE OF IT HE WAS CHOSEN IN 1839 PRESIDENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA BIBLE SOCIETY WHAT CHANGES WERE WROUGHT IN THE POLICY OF THE SOCIETY WHAT NUMEROUS PLANS WERE DEVISED AND EXECUTED FOR MULTIPLYING ITS OPERATIONS HOW IT WAS MADE A CORDIAL ALLIANCE OF ALL DENOMINATIONS WILL PRESENTLY APPEAR
HE HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN BUT FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE HIS ESCAPE HE HAD BEEN A WIDOWER--THAT IS HIS WIFE HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY FROM HIM TO NORTH CAROLINA AND IN THAT SPACE OF TIME HE HAD RECEIVED ONLY THREE LETTERS FROM HER

CAROLINE GASSWAY AFTER BEING HELD TO SERVICE BY SUMMERSETT WALTERS UNTIL SHE HAD REACHED HER TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAR WAS FORCED BY HARD TREATMENT AND THE LOVE OF FREEDOM TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR DELIVERANCE
HE HAD A WIFE
WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ALONE OF ALL CLASSES OF THE NATION ARE FREE FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OCCURRENCE HAVING WISELY FORESEEN THE DANGER AND FAITHFULLY LABORED TO AVERT IT BY REMOVING ITS CAUSES AND PREVENTING THE INHUMAN POLICY WHICH HAS HURRIED ON THE BLOODY CONVULSION

THE EXTENT OF HIS ASSISTANCE IN THIS DIRECTION WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW BUT BY THEM ITS VALUE WAS GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGED
MARY SAID THAT SHE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING GOOD OF HER MISTRESS
HIS FEARS OF BEING CARRIED BACK OPENED HIS EYES AND UNDERSTANDING SO THAT HE COULD READILY SEE THE FORCE OF THIS ARGUMENT AND ACCEPTING THE PROFFERED AID OF THE COMMITTEE WAS SENT ON HIS WAY REJOICING
THANKS BE TO GOD THAT I CAME TO THIS PLACE
I BELIEVE NO MORE STRONGLY AT THIS MOMENT THAN I HAVE BELIEVED EVER SINCE THE PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION WAS MADE BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT AS A CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY NO SMALL EXERTION WILL HAVE TO BE PUT FORTH BEFORE THE BLESSINGS OF FREEDOM AND KNOWLEDGE CAN BE FAIRLY ENJOYED BY THIS PEOPLE
SO UP THEY MOUNTED AND OFF THEY GALLOPED WITH THE HORSES HEADS TURNED DIRECTLY TOWARDS PENNSYLVANIA
THAT PECULIAR DOCTRINE OF THE SOCIETY WHICH REPUDIATES SYSTEMATIC DIVINITY AND WITH IT A PAID MINISTRY HE HELD IN SPECIAL REVERENCE FINDING CONFIRMATION OF ITS TRUTH IN THE GENERAL ADVOCACY OF SLAVERY BY THE POPULAR CLERGY OF HIS DAY

JULIA HAVING A LIVELY SENSE OF HIS MEANNESS STOOD MUCH IN FEAR OF BEING SOLD

ONE INSTANCE IS REMEMBERED OF A WOMAN WITH HER LITTLE BOY WHOM THEY PUT INTO GIRLS ATTIRE
HE MADE UP HIS MIND THEREFORE THAT HE MUST TRY A FREE COUNTRY
NEITHER GOD NOR MAN WAS REGARDED BY MEN WHO DEALT IN THE BODIES AND SOULS OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN
TO PUT IT BRIEFLY AND INDEED ONLY TO PUT ONE PART OF IT I MAY SAY THAT IT IS A TRIUMPH WHICH HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF RAISING 4,000,000 OF HUMAN BEINGS FROM THE VERY LOWEST DEPTHS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEGRADATION TO THAT LOFTY HEIGHT WHICH MEN HAVE ATTAINED WHEN THEY POSSESS EQUALITY OF RIGHTS IN THE FIRST COUNTRY ON THE GLOBE
PASSED 43 THROUGH OUR HANDS TRANSPORTED MOST OF THEM TO NORRISTOWN IN OUR OWN CONVEYANCE

BUT NO WILL WAS FOUND WHICH CAUSED ELIZABETH AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SLAVES TO DISTRUST THE MISTRESS MORE THAN EVER AS THEY SUSPECTED THAT SHE KNEW SOMETHING OF ITS DISAPPEARANCE
HE HAD A LITTLE MONEY AND HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT HIS COLOR WAS PERFECTLY ORTHODOX
THE PALTRY SUM OF TWENTY-FIVE CENTS A WEEK WAS ALL THAT WAS ALLOWED HIM OUT OF HIS HIRE
HE OWNED ABOUT EIGHTY HEAD--WAS VERY RICH AND A BIG MAN RICH ENOUGH TO LOSE ALL OF THEM
FOR THIS OFFENCE HE WAS ON ONE OCCASION STRIPPED NAKED AND FLOGGED SEVERELY
IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT FIVE DAYS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM HIS OLD HOME HE STATED HIS GRIEVANCES AS FOLLOWS
ALMOST ANTIPODAL AS THEY WERE IN CERTAIN RESPECTS EACH RECOGNIZED THE GENUINE RING OF THE OTHER AND ADMIRED AND RESPECTED THAT WHICH WAS MOST TRUE AND NOBLE
BUT HE HAD NEVER FELT PERSUADED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM TO REMAIN A SLAVE FOR HER SUPPORT

IT WOULD BE OF NO USE SHE CONTENDED AS SHE WAS FULLY BENT ON DYING RATHER THAN REMAIN A SLAVE THE SLAVE-HOLDERS EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HER AND WERE IN NO HURRY ABOUT BRINGING HER CASE TO AN ISSUE--THEY RATHER GAVE HER TIME TO BECOME CALM

THE REASON I DID NOT TELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE MURDERED
SEVERAL VERY INTERESTING LETTERS WERE RECEIVED FROM OTHO TAYLOR RELATIVE TO A RAID HE DESIGNED MAKING EXPRESSLY TO EFFECT THE ESCAPE OF HIS FAMILY

NORRISTOWN OCT 18TH 1857 2 O'CLOCK PM DEAR SIR:--THERE IS SIX MEN AND WOMEN AND FIVE CHILDREN MAKING ELEVEN PERSONS

DURING THIS ILLNESS ONE OF THE SONS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OFFERED AN INSULT TO JENNY FOR WHICH SHE FELT JUSTIFIED IN ADMINISTERING TO HIM A SEVERE CHASTISEMENT
HE FOUND HIS SON IN CANADA DOING WELL
WITH FULL FAITH IN HER PROMISES YEAR BY YEAR THE SLAVES AWAITED HER DEMISE WITH AS MUCH PATIENCE AS POSSIBLE AND OFTEN PRAYED THAT HER TIME MIGHT BE SHORTENED FOR THE GENERAL GOOD OF THE OPPRESSED
I LOVE HER FOR HER DEVOTEDNESS TO A GOOD CAUSE

I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL TO KEEP IT TO PRIVATE CIRCLES BUT THY VALUABLE LETTER OF LAST JULY HAS BEEN READ BY MANY WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST
IT IS MORE THAN UNCLE TOM WILSON'S HISTORY OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY WAR OR THE HUNDRED HISTORIES OF THE WAR ITSELF
AND SHALL MOREOVER FORFEIT AND PAY BY WAY OF CIVIL DAMAGES TO THE PARTY INJURED BY SUCH ILLEGAL CONDUCT THE SUM OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH FUGITIVE SO LOST AS AFORESAID TO BE RECOVERED BY ACTION OF DEBT IN ANY OF THE DISTRICT OR TERRITORIAL COURTS AFORESAID WITHIN WHOSE JURISDICTION THE SAID OFFENCE MAY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

IF THAT IS NOT A GOOD MAN THERE IS NO USE IN THE LORD WRITING HIS SIGNATURE ON HUMAN COUNTENANCES EVEN IN EARLY YOUTH HONORS WHICH HE NEVER SOUGHT WERE PRESSED UPON HIM AS HE GAVE ASSURANCE OF ABILITY COMMENSURATE WITH HIS WORTH
TWICE I WAS SEPARATED FROM MY WIVES
HIS MISTRESS WAS ALSO DUTCH A GREAT SWABBY FAT WOMAN WITH A VERY ILL DISPOSITION
NOW PLEASE DO NOT WRITE BACK THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANY SUCH THING
SOME OF US ARE ALMOST AS MUCH DISPLEASED WITH THE NORTH FOR TALKING OF THIS AS WITH THE SOUTH FOR HOLDING YOU IN SLAVERY
THE THIRTY DOLLARS WERE RAISED BY THE HARDEST EFFORT AND PASSED OVER TO THE PRETENDED FRIEND WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD AVAIL GREATLY IN THE EMERGENCY
SOME PECULIARITY ABOUT THE TRACK MADE BY THEIR WAGON ENABLED HIM TO TRACE THEM WITH EASE AND HE FOLLOWED THEM BY A DEVIOUS COURSE FROM DARBY TO A PLACE NEAR THE NAVY YARD IN PHILADELPHIA AND THEN BY INQUIRIES ETC TRACKED THEM TO KENSINGTON WHERE HE FOUND THEM AND WE BELIEVE SECURED THE WOMAN'S RELEASE
AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS HENRY FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT THE WALLS AND ALSO LOST SIGHT OF HIS COMRADES AT THE SAME TIME

HANDY JOSHUA ALIAS HAMILTON HAMBY 286
HUGHES WM 516
NEITHER MISTRESS NOR SERVANT WAS SATISFIED WITH EACH OTHER
I HEARD OF ANOTHER SUCH CASE NOT LONG SINCE
WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS CONFIDENTIAL
HE WAS HIMSELF ONE OF THE MOST EARNEST WORKERS IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE NEVER OMITTING IN A FEARLESS MANNER TO EMBRACE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF A PRO-SLAVERY SPIRIT
ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE SILENT WATCHES OF THE NIGHT SHE WAS DRAWN IRRESISTIBLY TO THE CHEST AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM VENTURING TO UNTIE THE ROPE AND RAISE THE LID A LITTLE TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILD STILL LIVED AND AT THE SAME TIME TO GIVE HER A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
JACK WAS A MEMBER OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH TOO AND HOPED HE WAS A GOOD CHRISTIAN
AND NOT ONLY HE BUT OTHERS ALSO HAD BEEN SENT TO THE AUCTION-BLOCK AND THERE MADE MERCHANDISE OF

TIMES ARE QUITE DULL
WHO WOULD BE FREE THEMSELVES MUST STRIKE THE BLOW I REGRET VERY MUCH THAT I HAVE NOT MORE CLOTHING TO SEND THAN THE STOCKINGS
AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DANGERS LIKELY TO ATTEND SUCH A STRUGGLE THEY CONCLUDED THAT THEY WOULD RISK ALL AND TRY THEIR LUCK AS MANY HAD DONE BEFORE THEM
IT FOLLOWS THEN THAT THE ABOLITION OF THE GIGANTIC SYSTEM OF HUMAN SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE GRANDEST EVENT IN MODERN HISTORY
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I WAS ARRESTED TRIED CONDEMNED BY A PACKED JURY AND INCARCERATED IN PRISON FOR MY ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENTS

JUDGE BENJAMIN I
NOT UNFREQUENTLY HAS THE IMAGE OF THIS SINGULARLY FAITHFUL MINISTER ENTERED THE WRITER'S MIND AS HE ONCE APPEARED WHEN VISITING THE SYNOD OF HIS CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA
THUS TERMINATED THIS INTERESTING CASE WHICH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AGITATED THE PUBLIC MIND OF BURLINGTON COUNTY TO AN EXTENT ALMOST UNEQUALLED
I WAS IMPELLED TO WRITE WITHOUT DELAY BY THE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE IN TIME FOR THE FREEMAN AND THAT ANY PROCRASTINATION ON MY PART MIGHT JEOPARD OTHERS OF THESE SUFFERING PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING AS WAS THIS POOR GIRL IN FANCIED SECURITY

HENCE SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS ONLY NATURAL FOR HIM IN THIS CASE TO HAVE TAKEN THE STEPS HE DID
WHO WOULD NOT HELP THESE GENEROUS-HEARTED MEN WHO ARE DEVOTING THEIR WHOLE ENERGIES TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE CRUSHED AND DOWNTRODDEN
STILL DEAR SIR:--I REGRET EXCEEDINGLY TO LEARN BY YOUR FAVOR OF 4TH INSTANT THAT ALL THINGS ARE NOT READY
I HAVE FURNISHED HIM WITH A PRETTY GOOD PAIR OF BOOTS AND GAVE HIM MONEY TO PAY HIS PASSAGE TO PHILADELPHIA
THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS IN BALTIMORE TOOK THE MATTER IN HAND AND MANY OTHER WORTHY CITIZENS BELONGING TO THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND OTHERS LENT THEIR AID AND INFLUENCE
THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY IN HIM WAS PRETTY LARGELY DEVELOPED
SLAVERY HAD ROBBED HIM SHAMEFULLY IT IS TRUE
HOWEVER HARDLY MONTHS HAD PASSED ERE THE KEEN SCENT OF THE SLAVE-HUNTERS HAD TRAILED THEM TO WHERE THEY HAD FANCIED THEMSELVES SECURE
HE DID NOT MAKE ONE COMPLAINT OF BAD TREATMENT

JONES 558
LET ME EXPLAIN A FEW MATTERS TO YOU
THE WHOLE MATTER IS IN A NUTSHELL
KINGSTON JULY 20 1857
LAST NIGHT I LECTURED IN A WHITE CHURCH IN PROVIDENCE
THIS I THINK IS THE BEST WAY
IN THIS LETTER I HAVE ASKED HIM TO SEND A BOX TO YOU FOR ME WHICH YOU WILL PLEASE PAY THE FARE OF THE EXPRESS UPON IT WHEN YOU GET IT PLEASE TO LET ME KNOW AND I WILL SEND YOU THE MONEY TO PAY THE EXPENSES OF THE CARRIAGE CLEAR THROUGH
IF IT WERE NECESSARY WE MIGHT CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE SCORES OF EDITORIALS COMMUNICATIONS EPISTLES ETC ALL BREATHING A SIMILAR SPIRIT OF RESPECT FOR THE RARE WORTH OF THIS WONDERFUL MAN BUT SPACE FORBIDS
THE FIRST OF JANUARY PAST WAS THE TIME SOLEMNLY FIXED UPON TO TOOK OUT BUT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER NOT FOUND ON THE RECORD BOOK THEIR STRATEGICAL MINDS DID NOT SEE THE WAY ALTOGETHER CLEAR AND THEY DEFERRED STARTING UNTIL EASTER SUNDAY
I OF COURSE WAS INTRODUCED TO THOSE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM BUT JOE--WELL JOE TOOK A SEAT AND DID NOT SEEM TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT AN INTRODUCTION
WELL WISHES BOTH SOUL AND BODY
HE WAS A FARMER LIVING NEAR WHELDON
FLINT WATCHED THE WAYS OF THE TRADERS AND FOLLOWED FOR EFFECT THEIR EXAMPLE
HE WAS SURE THAT PERIL WAS AT HAND AND THAT HAVING BEEN BRANDED FOR ESCAPING BEFORE HE SHOULD BE WHIPPED TO DEATH IF TAKEN AGAIN SO HE PACKED UP HIS LITTLE WARDROBE AND EMBARKED FOR ENGLAND IMMEDIATELY
RENEWED CHEERING WE WELCOME HIM THEN WITH A CORDIALITY WHICH KNOWS NO STINT AND NO LIMIT FOR HIM AND FOR HIS NOBLE ASSOCIATES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
OFTEN WAS MRS HILLIARD'S HOUSE AN ASYLUM FOR FUGITIVE SLAVES
WILLIAM WHIPPER ILLUSTRATION
WHEN HE FLED HE WAS ONLY TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE
INDEED IN VIEW OF SLAVERY AND ITS HORRID FEATURES THE WONDER IS NOT THAT MORE WAS NOT DONE BUT THAT ANY THING WAS DONE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE NOT DRIVEN ALMOST OUT OF THEIR SENSES
PRICE HAD LATELY PUT ME IN CHARGE OF HER BROTHER SAMUEL M
MY RESPECTS C
CHEERS MORE THAN THIS IT IS A TRIUMPH WHICH HAS PRONOUNCED THE IRREVERSIBLE DOOM OF SLAVERY IN ALL COUNTRIES AND FOR ALL TIME
AT FIRST THE FREIGHT AGENT DECLINED DELIVERING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
IN SPEAKING OF HIS MISTRESS HOWEVER HE DID NOT EXPRESS HIMSELF IN TERMS QUITE SO COMPLIMENTARY AS OSCAR
FOR LEAVING HE GAVE THE FOLLOWING REASONS
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE POOR FELLOW FROM HIS IMPENDING DOOM IT SEEMED THAT NOTHING WOULD AVAIL BUT A BOLD STRATEGICAL MOVEMENT
HE WAS BORN IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA OGLETHORPE COUNTY AND WAS OWNED BY DR THOMAS STEPHENS OF LEXINGTON
TRAVERSE
THE NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO AIDED IN THIS SPECIAL WORK HOWEVER WERE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN A HUNDRED PER CENT
SHE IS MEDIUM SIZED DARK COMPLEXION GOOD-LOOKING WITH RATHER A DOWN LOOK

JOSEPH CAHELL OF VA OF FREDERICKSBURG VA.--CORDELIA'S ESCAPE FROM HER MISTRESS IN PHILADELPHIA
DEAR FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--THE BEARER OF THIS IS ONE OF THE TWENTY-ONE THAT I THOUGHT HAD ALL GONE NORTH
SHE TRIED TO DESCRIBE HER SUFFERINGS AND FEARS WHILE IN THE BOX BUT IN VAIN
FOR THIS SPECIAL OBJECT HE HAD SAVED UP SIXTY-EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS ALL OF WHICH BUT THE FIFTEEN CENTS HE WILLINGLY PAID FOR HIS PASSAGE ON THE BOAT
SHE DESIRED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR TO FALL BACK UPON INDEPENDENT OF THE COMMITTEE'S AID
NEARLY THIRTY YEARS PRIOR TO THE ESCAPE OF RICHARD AND HIS BROTHER THEIR MOTHER WAS IN VERY BAD HEALTH SO MUCH SO THAT PHYSICIANS REGARDED HER INCURABLE
IN THAT LETTER I WISHED TO RECEIVE INFORMATION RESPECTING THE BEST WAY TO EXPEND MONEY FOR THE AID OF FUGITIVES
HE HAD LOOKED FULLY INTO HIS MASTER'S TREATMENT OF HIM AND HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS WRONG IN EVERY RESPECT FOR ONE MAN TO MAKE ANOTHER WORK AND THEN TAKE ALL HIS WAGES FROM HIM
SHE CASTS HER BENIGNANT EYE ABROAD OVER THE EARTH AND WHEREVER SHE SEES MAN SHE SEES HIM AS MAN AS A BEING MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD WHETHER AN INDIAN AN AFRICAN OR A CAUCASIAN SUN MAY SHINE UPON HIM
JOHNSON DAVID SNIVELY AND HENRY DUNMORE
TRUE HE DID NOT FLOG BUT HE RESORTED TO OTHER MEANS OF PUNISHMENT WHEN HE DESIRED TO MAKE THE SLAVES FEEL THAT HE WAS MASTER
INDEED IF SLAVE-HOLDERS HAD ONLY BEEN AWARE OF THE GROWING TENDENCY OF TOM'S MIND THEY WOULD HAVE REJOICED AT HEARING OF HIS DEPARTURE FOR CANADA
I HAD A WIFE BUT THEY DID NOT ALLOW ME TO GO SEE HER ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE BILL PROVIDENTIALLY ESCAPED FROM A WELL-KNOWN CRIPPLE WHOM HE UNDERTOOK TO DESCRIBE AS A VERY SNEAKING-LOOKING MAN MEDIUM SIZE SMOOTH FACE
LAST NIGHT THEY THEN LEARNED THAT HE HAD LANDED THEM AT THE ROCKS NEAR THE OLD SWEDES CHURCH IN THE CARE OF OUR EFFICIENT PILOT WHO IS IN THE EMPLOY OF MY FRIEND JOHN HILLIS AND HE HAS THEM NOW IN CHARGE

IF YOU ARE WILLING TO RECEVE THEM WRITE TO ME IMEDIATELY AND I WILL BRING THEM TO YOUR TO MORROW EVENING I WOULD NOT HAVE WROTE THIS BUT THE TIMES ARE SO MUCH WORSE FINANCIALY THAT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO HEAR FROM YOU BEFORE I BROUGHT SUCH A CROWD DOWN PLEAS ANSWER THIS AND OBLIGE JOHN AUGUSTA
FOR YEARS THE IDEA OF ESCAPE HAD BEEN DAILY CHERISHED
BUT WHERE WAS THE MEANS
HE IS ABOUT 5 FEET 8 OR 10 INCHES HIGH SPARE MADE BUSHY HAIR AND VERY GENTEEL APPEARANCE
38 BESIDES THE CRIME OF TREASON WHICH I HAVE THUS NOTICED THERE ARE OFFENCES OF MINOR GRADES AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION AND THE STATE SOME OR OTHER OF WHICH MAY BE APPARENTLY ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL COME BEFORE YOU
MR HUNT IS MUCH PLEASED WITH THIS LAND OF FREEDOM AND I HOPE HE MAY DO WELL FOR HIMSELF AND MUCH GOOD TO OTHERS
HILL JOHN HENRY 189
BUT THE MOURNFUL THOUGHT THAT THESE APPEALS SIGHS TEARS AND PRAYERS WOULD CONTINUE IN MOST CASES TO BE MADE TILL DEATH THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE DIRECTLY FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF SUCH SUFFERERS WAS OFTEN AS PAINFUL AS THE ESCAPE FROM THE AUCTION BLOCK WAS GRATIFYING
EARTHLY DISTINCTION DISAPPEARING THE MOMENT THE SINKING SOUL OR THE SUFFERING BODY WAS IN QUESTION
BUT SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY BY DEATH BEFORE I HAD FINISHED PAYING FOR HER
63 PRATT STREET BALTIMORE
HER MISTRESS AT ONE TIME WAS THE OWNER OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES BUT WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS SHE HAD GREATLY LESSENED THE NUMBER BY SALES
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I RAN TO THE POST-OFFICE WITH MY LETTER PAID THE POSTAGE AND WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR MY CHANGE THE CAR BELL RANG
WITHOUT JUDGE OR JURY ALL WERE HURRIED BACK TO WEAR THE YOKE AGAIN
MCMURTRIE ESQ FOR THE CLAIMANT
FIFTEEN CENTS THE BALANCE OF HIS ENTIRE CAPITAL WAS ALL THAT HE HAD WHEN HE LANDED IN PHILADELPHIA
THE DEATH OF HIS PARENTS HOWEVER AND SUBSEQUENTLY THAT OF HIS OLDEST BROTHER MADE HIS CONNECTION WITH BOTH THESE INSTITUTIONS A VERY BRIEF ONE AND HE WAS OBLIGED AS THE CHARGE OF THE FAMILY NOW DEVOLVED UPON HIM TO CONTINUE HIS STUDIES PRIVATELY AT HOME UNDER THE FRIENDLY DIRECTION OF THE LATE DR DUFFIELD
THE YOUNG MAN SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE IT TO HIS SISTER
WE HARDLY SUPPOSED THAT THE MOST STRENUOUS EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WOULD BE ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE BRITISH MARKET
THINGS WENT ON FAVORABLY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS WHEN TO THEIR ALARM SLAVE-HUNTERS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WAS OBTAINED TO MAKE IT QUITE PLAIN THAT JOHN WILLIAM AND JAMES WERE THE IDENTICAL PERSONS FOR WHOM THE HUNTERS WERE IN HOT PURSUIT WHEN BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE THEY WERE PRETTY THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND FELT VERY ANXIOUS TO BE SAFELY OFF TO CANADA
JOHN HENRY NEVER FORGOT THOSE WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN A FELLOW-SUFFERER IN SLAVERY
THE PAPERS STATE THAT THEY WERE ALL GIVEN UP TO THE MARSHAL OF EVANSVILLE INDIANA
DID YOU EVER READ A LITTLE POEM COMMENCING I THINK WITH THESE WORDS
THE PEOPLE EARNEST AND SIMPLE-HEARTED DESIRED THE SINCERE MILK OF THE WORD AND RECEIVING IT GREW THEREBY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH BECAME AVOWED ABOLITIONISTS
PUBLIC MEETINGS WERE HELD TO CONSULT ABOUT WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE
HE ALSO CHARGED THE BLACKSMITH WITH BEING ADDICTED TO BAD HABITS
AS THE WAY OF TRAVEL VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN FOR THE STERNER SEX WAS HARD ENOUGH TO TEST THE STRONGEST NERVES AND TO TRY THE FAITH OF THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE EVERY WOMAN WHO WON HER FREEDOM BY THIS PERILOUS UNDERTAKING DESERVES COMMEMORATION
BUT WHEN HE EXPLAINED HOW HE WAS ENSLAVED BY A MAN NAMED JOHN B
I HOPE THEY HAVE ARRIVED SAFE ERE THIS
STILL HIS EYES WERE FAIRLY OPENED TO SEE HIS DANGER AND TO LEARN A VALUABLE LESSON AT THE SAME TIME
OF THEM SHE SPOKE FAVORABLY SAYING THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED AS HARD AS MANY OTHERS WERE AT THIS PERIOD CLARISSA WAS ABOUT TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE OF A BRIGHT BROWN COMPLEXION WITH HANDSOME FEATURES EXCEEDINGLY RESPECTFUL AND MODEST AND POSSESSED ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A WELL-BRED YOUNG LADY

THE HUSBAND HAD BEEN OWNED BY CAPTAIN JAMES TAYLOR--THE WIFE AND CHILDREN BY GEORGE CARTER
THE DOCTOR HOWEVER HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY BY DEATH SO JACK COULD SEE NO HOPE OR VIRTUE IN HAVING A WHITE FATHER ALTHOUGH A CHIVALRIC GENTLEMAN WHILE LIVING AND A MAN OF HIGH STANDING AMONGST SLAVE-HOLDERS
FOR THIS OFFENCE HE WAS NOT EVEN IMPRISONED
CLEVELAND FOR THE PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL POSITION IT HAS ATTAINED IN THE REGARDS OF THIS CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND THAT THEY BEAR AN EARNEST TESTIMONY TO THE SOUND JUDGMENT AND UNWEARIED ZEAL WHICH HAVE EVER CHARACTERIZED THE DISCHARGE OF HIS DUTIES IN HIS RESPONSIBLE OFFICE LET THIS TRIBUTE COMING FROM THE BITTEREST PERSONAL OPPOSITION THAT EVER MAN ENCOUNTERED MEASURE THE WORK THAT EXTORTED IT
HE KNOWS THAT IT IS SO WITH YOU ALSO THEREFORE HE ONLY STATES THE CASE BEING ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS FOR AT LEAST THOSE TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE PROGRESS OF RELIGION
HERE HE WAS WORKED SO HARD THAT IN ONE MONTH HE LOST HIS HEALTH
WAS THERE EVER A MORE PERFECT TRAIN OF EVIDENCE EXHIBITED TO PROVE THE IDENTITY OF A PERSON THAN ON THE PRESENT OCCASION
OUR CONVICTIONS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THIS COURSE ARE AS STRONG AS THEY EVER WERE

DAVIS ISAAC D 313
A SECRET PASSAGE WAS PROCURED FOR HIM ON ONE OF THE STEAMERS RUNNING BETWEEN PHILADELPHIA AND RICHMOND VA
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS ON REACHING HIS DESTINATION AFTER BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH THE FAMILY BEING FAMILIAR WITH SOUTHERN MANNERS TO HAVE THEM ALL PREPARED AT A GIVEN HOUR FOR THE STARTING OF THE STEAMBOAT FOR CINCINNATI AND TO JOIN HIM AT THE WHARF WHEN HE WOULD BOLDLY ASSUME THE PART OF A SLAVEHOLDER AND THE FAMILY NATURALLY THAT OF SLAVES AND IN THIS WAY HE HOPED TO REACH CINCINNATI DIRECT BEFORE THEIR OWNER HAD FAIRLY DISCOVERED THEIR ESCAPE
AT TEN O'CLOCK APPEARED WILLIAM
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SAID THE OFFICERS TO THE SLAVE-HOLDER
BUT ALL CAME OFF CLEAR
GOOD NIGHT
THIS CENTURY HAS GRAND SCENES TO SHOW AND BOAST OF AMONG ITS FELLOWS
THE QUESTION WAS THEN PUT TO JACOB THE FATHER OF THE BOY

HENCE THEY PLOTTED TOGETHER TO DEVISE A STRATAGEM BY WHICH THEY COULD DESTROY THE FREE SOUTH AND IN THE MEANTIME THE HARPER'S FERRY DIFFICULTY BY MR BROWN WAS SEIZED UPON TO EXCITE THE PEOPLE AGAINST ME AND THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT LIES WERE TOLD ABOUT ME AS TRYING TO EXCITE SLAVES TO REBELLION
WE HAVE MERELY A LIMITED NUMBER OF THEM PRINTED
BUT AN IMPORTANT LETTER FROM THE FRIEND WITH WHOM HE WAS SECRETED WRITTEN A SHORT WHILE BEFORE HE ESCAPED ON A BOAT GIVES SOME IDEA OF HIS CONDITION
WE MAY LOOK UPON IT AS GOD'S CONTROVERSY WITH THE NATION
NO RHETORIC OR FINE SCHOLARSHIP WAS NEEDED IN HIS CASE TO MAKE HIS STORY INTERESTING
THE KEYSTONE STATE CASE.--OUR ARTICLE YESTERDAY MORNING BROUGHT US SEVERAL LETTERS OF INQUIRY AND OFFERS OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO AID IN THE PURCHASE FROM HIS MASTER OF THE UNFORTUNATE INMATE OF NEWCASTLE JAIL

I KNOW THAT ALL IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED
ANOTHER WARM ADMIRER OF THIS GREAT LOVER OF HUMANITY IN A LETTER TO GEORGE W
AND I WENT SEVERAL MILES YESTERDAY IN THE COUNTRY TO TRY TO LEARN WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM BUT COULD NOT HEAR OF THEM
ALTHOUGH THE DESPATCH WAS NOT READ TO THE OFFICER NOT THAT HIS STORY WAS DOUBTED BUT PURELY FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS HE WAS NEVERTHELESS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME PARTY AND THAT THEY WOULD BE DULY LOOKED AFTER

HENRY WASHINGTON ALIAS ANTHONY HANLY AND HENRY STEWART
THIS SON BELONGED TO THE SAID PIPPER ALREADY DESCRIBED
ON ARRIVING THERE HE SOUGHT OUT AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CAPTAIN AND ARRANGED WITH HIM TO BRING HIM TO PHILADELPHIA
INDEED HE COULD BUT WONDER HOW IT WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE HIT UPON SUCH AN EXPEDIENT TO RID HIMSELF OF HIS UNHAPPY LOT
HE HAD ARRIVED BY STEAMER FROM NEW YORK AFTER RESIDING THERE FOR THREE YEARS
HE WANTED TO BE BEATING ME ALL THE TIME THIS WAS A LUXURY WHICH JACOB HAD NO APPETITE FOR CONSEQUENTLY HE COULD NOT RESIST SIGNIFYING HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO YIELD ALTHOUGH RESISTANCE HAD TO BE MADE AT SOME PERSONAL RISK AS HIS MASTER HAD NO MORE REGARD FOR A COLORED MAN THAN HE HAD FOR A STONE UNDER HIS FEET WITH HIM THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION WAS COMMON

IN THE REGULAR ORDER OF ARRANGEMENTS THE WANTS OF ABRAM AND RICHARD WERE DULY MET BY THE COMMITTEE FINANCIALLY AND OTHERWISE AND THEY WERE FORWARDED TO CANADA
AS A SLAVE LABORER HE HAD BEEN SWEATING AND TOILING TO ENRICH A MAN BY THE NAME OF THOMAS J
UNDER HIS OLD MASTER THE USAGE HAD BEEN BAD ENOUGH BUT HE FEARED THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL WORSE UNDER THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
THOUSANDS OF HEARTS WILL FEEL A TOUCH OF GRIEF AT THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH
THE FOLLOWING LETTERS ARE SPECIMENS AND SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
HOWEVER FEELING SOMEWHAT RELIEVED TO-DAY FROM MY PARALYSIS OWING TO THE CHEERING SUNSHINE AND THE FAVOR OF MY ALMIGHTY PRESERVER I WILL TRY TO DO WHAT I CAN IN DICTATING A FEW ANECDOTES TO MY AMANUENSIS WHICH MAY AFFORD YOU AND YOUR READERS SOME GRATIFICATION

THERE WERE FOUR TRIALS IN ALL LASTING THREE DAYS
HER INFLUENCE OVER OTHERS AND ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG WAS EXTRAORDINARY
I DIDN'T LIKE HIS MARRYING INTO OUR FAMILY WHO WERE CONSIDERED VERY FAR TYLER'S SUPERIORS ON THE PLANTATION HE SAID TYLER WAS A VERY CROSS MAN AND TREATED THE SERVANTS VERY CRUELLY
I FOUND THE MAN HAD ARRIVED
THIS NOBLE DECISION WAS THE CROWNING ACT IN THE UNDERTAKINGS OF THOUSANDS SIMILARLY SITUATED
THEY HAD BETTER GET THE CONSENT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD BEFORE THEY PASSED SUCH A THING
WHILST ROBERT DID NOT PUBLISH HIS MISTRESS HE GAVE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF WHERE HE WAS FROM AND WHY HE WAS FOUND IN THE CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE IN THE DEAD OF WINTER IN A STATE OF DESTITUTION

ABRAM HIS COMRADE ALLIED HIMSELF FAITHFULLY TO JOHN BULL UNTIL UNCLE SAM BECAME INVOLVED IN THE CONTEST WITH THE REBELS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS CONNECTION WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA ABOLITION SOCIETY WAS THE MEANS OF ENLISTING HIS TALENTS AND EXERTIONS IN THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE
WE FEEL THEREFORE NOT ONLY GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A SKETCH NOT MERELY OF THE LEADING COLORED POET IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO OF ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL CONTRIBUTORS AS WELL AS ONE OF THE ABLEST ADVOCATES OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND OF THE SLAVE

SHE CHARGED HER MISTRESS WITH TRYING TO WORK HER TO DEATH AND WITH UNKIND TREATMENT GENERALLY
FROM THE LEARNED AND THE UNLEARNED FROM THOSE IN HIGH PLACES AND FROM THOSE IN HUMBLE STATIONS MANY TESTIMONIALS REACHED THE FAMILY RESPECTING THIS GREAT FRIEND OF THE SLAVE BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER A SINGLE EPISTLE FROM ANY ONE WAS MORE AFFECTINGLY APPRECIATED BY THE BEREAVED FAMILY THAN THE EPISTLE JUST QUOTED FROM ELIZABETH J

WHEN WILL OUR FIRST OF AUGUST COME
ROBERT JONES AND WIFE
MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM BY DOUGLASS WAS A REMARKABLE BOOK AND WAS JUSTLY APPRECIATED BY THE LIBERTY-LOVING PEOPLE OF THE NORTH AND OF ENGLAND BUT IT WAS THE STORY OF A SINGLE HERO
HE SHOWED THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO AFFORD HIS BROTHER THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO THE OFFICERS AT THE MARSHAL'S OFFICE HAVING DECEIVED HIM IN RELATION TO THE TIME THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS
SO WHEN DICK ARRIVED THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT IT WAS AS LITTLE AS THEY COULD DO TO GIVE THESE FRIENDS THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE LITTLE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGER
FOR CLARISSA AND HER TWO BROTHERS A REWARD OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS KEPT STANDING IN THE PAPERS FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AS THESE ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED VERY RARE AND VALUABLE
THEIR NAMES WERE REBECCA RACHEL CAROLINE AND SARAH ANN AND A MORE DISAGREEABLE FAMILY OF OLD MAIDS COULD NOT BE FOUND IN A YEAR'S TIME
WE HAD NOT HOWEVER PROCEEDED MANY STEPS FROM THE PLACE BEFORE THE VIRGINIA SLAVE WAS REMOVED
A GENTLEMAN IN LONDON WROTE TO ME A DAY OR TWO AGO TO KNOW IF WE COULD FIND A BERTH FOR A FINE FELLOW WHO HAD JUST APPLIED TO HIM
THE YOUNGEST A SUCKING BABE
THE STEAMSHIP PENNSYLVANIA ON ONE OF HER REGULAR TRIPS FROM RICHMOND BROUGHT ONE PASSENGER OF WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD NO KNOWLEDGE
THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED STRANGE OR CRUEL IN MARYLAND
WRIGHT LEEDS 410
FOWLER ARTHUR ALIAS BENJ
JUST A LITTLE WHILE SINCE THE AMERICAN FLAG TO THE FLYING BONDMAN WAS AN ENSIGN OF BONDAGE
THE REASON I CANNOT TELL ABOUT THE OTHERS IS BECAUSE THEY WENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN FIVE YEARS
IN 1825 26 27 SHE LIVED WITH MY BROTHER
I LEFT BECAUSE I WANTED MY TIME AND MONEY FOR MYSELF NO ONE COULD GAINSAY SUCH A PLAIN COMMON-SENSE ANSWER AS THAT
THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD EXPENSE THE COMMITTEE GLADLY BORE
ONE DAY IN A RAGE HE UNDERTOOK TO BEAT ME WITH THE LIMB OF A CHERRY-TREE
ASBURY WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE A MAN OF DARK HUE SIZE AND HEIGHT ABOUT MEDIOCRITY AND MENTAL ABILITY QUITE ABOVE THE AVERAGE
IF IT DOES THE DARNED ABOLITIONISTS EXCUSE ME MAY RUIN ME
NORMIS LIVING IN BALTIMORE
THUS GROWING TO HATE SLAVERY IN EVERY WAY AND MANNER SHE WAS PREPARED TO MAKE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO BE FREE
IN ONE PARTICULAR ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE DEPOT WHERE THEY WERE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE THE OFFICER WAS IN THE DARK AS HIS DESPATCH POINTED TO THE REGULAR TRAIN AND OF COURSE TO THE DEPOT AT ELEVENTH AND MARKET STREETS
SUFFER THEM TO BE NO LONGER DEPRESSED BENEATH THE BRUAT CREATION BUT MAY THEY BE LOOKED UPON AS MEN MADE OF THE BONE AND BLOOD AS THE ANGLO-AMERICANS
IT IS NOT OUR PLACE TO INQUIRE TOO CLOSELY INTO THIS SOCIAL CIRCLE BUT WE MAY SAY THAT MRS MOTT'S HISTORY IS A LIVING PROOF THAT THE HIGHEST PUBLIC DUTIES MAY BE RECONCILED WITH PERFECT FIDELITY TO PRIVATE RESPONSIBILITIES
IT IS BUT JUST TO SAY THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE PITTMAN FAMILY THAT HIS MOTHER AND HIS FELLOW-SERVANT HAD BEEN SO BARBAROUSLY MURDERED
MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I RECEIVED THY TOUCHING LETTER OF THE 10TH INST
THE ABILITY EXHIBITED IN SOME OF HER PRODUCTIONS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT SOME DOUBTED AND OTHERS DENIED THEIR ORIGINALITY
TO RENDER NEEDLESS THIS WRITING TO THE SOUTH THE COMMITTEE OFTEN SUBMITTED TO BE TAXED WITH DEMANDS TO RESCUE CLOTHING AS WELL AS WIVES ETC BELONGING TO SUCH AS HAD BEEN ALREADY AIDED
IN ESCAPING HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THEM BOTH
UNFORTUNATELY HIS LOT HAD BEEN OF SUCH A NATURE THAT NO HELPING OPPORTUNITY HAD BEEN AFFORDED FOR THE CULTIVATION OF HIS MIND
IN HIS OWN FAMILY HE HAS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED THE PURSUIT OF ANY OCCUPATION CONGENIAL TO THE PERSON CHOOSING IT
IF YOUR WIFE WANTS TO SEE ME YOU COLD BRING HER WITH YOU IF YOU COME YOUR SELF
IT WAS HARD TO BE DEFINITE CONCERNING MINOR MATTERS WHILE ABSORBED IN THE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS THAT HER TALE OF SUFFERING HAD NATURALLY AWAKENED
THE SLAVE-HOLDER DEMANDED HIS SLAVES WHO HE SAID WERE CONCEALED IN THE HOUSE
MARY EPPS ALIAS EMMA BROWN--JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON
RECEIVING A CALL FROM A CHURCH IN PROVIDENCE HE ACCEPTED NOT WITHOUT KNOWING HOWEVER THAT HIS MISSION WAS TO BE LEFT IN FAITHFUL HANDS TO CARRY ON THE GOOD WORK
I TOLD HIM I WOULD FURNISH HIS FAMILY WITH PROVISIONS FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS

HE WAS WEALTHY CLOSE AND STINGY AND OWNED NINE HEAD OF SLAVES AND A FARM ON WHICH WILLIAM SERVED
ARMSTEAD MOSES 430
TAYLOR MARY 325
WILMINGTON BECAME AN ABOLITION CITY AND FOR ONCE AT LEAST A PROPHET WAS NOT WITHOUT HONOR IN HIS OWN CITY
ORDINARILY HE COULD NOT TOO OFTEN VISIT THESE TRAVELERS SHAKE THEM TOO WARMLY BY THE HAND OR IMPART TO THEM TOO FREELY OF HIS SUBSTANCE TO AID THEM ON THEIR JOURNEY
THE FILTHY CABINS ALLOTTED FOR THEIR HABITATIONS WERE IN THEMSELVES INCENTIVES TO PERSONAL UNCLEANLINESS
THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL TO HIM BUT HE RESOLVED TO GIVE IT ALL WILLINGLY TO ANY MAN WHO WOULD SECRETE HIM OR PROCURE HIM A PASSAGE TO PHILADELPHIA
STILL MY DEAR FRIEND:--I WROTE TO YOU SOME TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO ENCLOSING THE LETTER TO THE CARE OF A FRIEND IN PHILADELPHIA WHOM I WISHED TO INTRODUCE TO YOU
ISAAC WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE DARK TALL WELL-MADE INTELLIGENT AND WAS OWNED BY GEORGE BROWN WHO RESIDED AT DEEP CREEK
RINGOLD ROBERT SMITH AND JOHN HENRY RICHARDS ALL FROM BALTIMORE
THE REGULAR EXAMINATION WAS MADE AND HE PASSED CREDITABLY
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT DR LEWIS PILOTED THEM TO NEAR HIS HOUSE AT LEWISBURG YORK COUNTY ON THE BANKS OF THE CONEWAGO
WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE WE FOUND SEVERAL BOARDERS IN THE SITTING-ROOM AND A FEW NEIGHBORS
BURRIS WAS SOLD AT PUBLIC SALE FOR AIDING SLAVES TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR MASTERS AND WAS BOUGHT BY THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY
BUT NO
THEY WERE ALL HARD TRUE THEY HAD BUT THREE SLAVES TO OPPRESS BUT THESE THEY SPARED NOT
MATTHEW WAS TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE VERY STOUT--NO FOOL--A MAN OF DECIDED RESOLUTION AND OF THE VERY BEST BLACK COMPLEXION PRODUCED IN THE SOUTH
E.F.P
IT IS DECLARED IN THE ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH I HAVE ALREADY CITED THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE CONVICTED OF TREASON UNLESS ON THE TESTIMONY OF TWO WITNESSES TO THE SAME OVERT ACT OR ON CONFESSION IN OPEN COURT THIS AND THE CORRESPONDING LANGUAGE IN THE ACT OF CONGRESS OF THE 30TH OF APRIL 1790 SEEM TO REFER TO THE PROOFS ON THE TRIAL AND NOT TO THE PRELIMINARY HEARING BEFORE THE COMMITTING MAGISTRATE OR THE PROCEEDING BEFORE THE GRAND INQUEST
THOMAS GARRETT ANNOUNCED THIS IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER
FOR JOHN'S HIRE HE RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR
DIRECT TO BOX NO
REMEMBERING THAT FOUR OF HER CHILDREN HAD BEEN SNATCHED AWAY FROM HER AND SOLD SOUTH AND SHE HERSELF WAS THREATENED WITH THE SAME FATE SHE WAS WILLING TO SUFFER HUNGER SLEEP IN THE WOODS FOR NIGHTS AND DAYS WANDERING TOWARDS CANADA RATHER THAN TRUST HERSELF ANY LONGER UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HER KIND OWNER
WILL THEREFORE KINDLY HAND FOR US
THE SITUATION OF HIS FAMILY CONCERNED HIM WITH TENFOLD MORE WEIGHT THAN EVER BEFORE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE THE OFFER TO HIS WIFE'S MASTER TO PURCHASE HER WITH HIS CHILDREN HIS HEART FAILED HIM THROUGH FEAR OF AWAKENING THE IRE OF SLAVEHOLDERS AGAINST HIM AS HE KNEW THAT THE LAW AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT WERE ALIKE DEADLY OPPOSED TO THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM IN THE SLAVE
ARRIVAL FROM DORCHESTER CO 1860
AS NOTIFIED THAT EVENING THE FOUR LARGE AND TWO SMALL HAMS ARRIVED AND TURNED OUT TO BE OF THE VERY FINEST QUALITY JUST SUCH AS ANY TRADER WOULD HAVE PAID THE HIGHEST MARKET PRICE FOR
ACCORDINGLY HE DID GO TO MY ROOM BUT I HAD GONE FOR SHELTER TO ANOTHER ROOM
AFTER HAVING FULLY PONDERED THE PROSPECT OF HER FREEDOM AND THE ONLY MODE OFFERED BY WHICH SHE COULD ESCAPE SHE CONSENTED TO ENDURE BRAVELY WHATEVER OF SUFFERING AND TRIAL MIGHT FALL TO HER LOT IN THE UNDERTAKING--AND AS WAS THE CASE WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHERS SHE SUCCEEDED
BEING ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT HE MAY YET MAKE HIS MARK
IN SHORT HE WAS A MAN WELL ADAPTED TO MAKE A GOOD BRITISH SUBJECT
HE TALKED FOR AN HOUR AS ONE INSPIRED AND AS NONE BUT FUGITIVE SLAVES COULD TALK
THE COMMITTEE GLADLY GAVE THEM AID AND SUCCOR AND AGREED WITH WILLIAM THAT THE CAPTAIN DESERVED ALL THAT HE RECEIVED FOR THEIR DELIVERANCE

THIS WAS A SUCCESS
NO SOONER WAS THE OLD MAN WITHIN THE ENCLOSURES THAN HE ASKED DINAH WHOSE CHILD IS THAT POINTING TO THE BOY
CONCLUDING THAT JOSIAH WELLS WHO CLAIMED HIM HAD RECEIVED A THOUSAND TIMES TOO MUCH OF HIS LABOR ALREADY ANTHONY WAS IN A FIT STATE OF MIND TO MAKE A RESOLUTE EFFORT TO GAIN HIS FREEDOM
SHE BELONGED TO THE SAME CHURCH EBENEZER
THE SEPARATION WAS PAINFUL AS WAS EVERYTHING BELONGING TO THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY
THE CAUSE OF HIS RETICENCE CAN BE AS WELL CONJECTURED BY THE READER AS THE WRITER
IT WAS ON HIS FARMS UNDER MEAN OVERSEERS THAT JOHN HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND KEPT UNDER THE HARROW
CATHARINES AUGUST 4 1854
DOUBTLESS THE MISTRESS LOOKED UPON THIS COURSE AS A PIECE OF THE MOST HIGHHANDED STEALING
RICHARD OWED SERVICE TO MRS MARY LOREN A WIDOW
MR AND MRS RENSON ARE LIVING IN HAMILTON C.W
HER PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO HER HUSBAND
ACT CALMLY--DON'T BE FRIGHTENED BY YOUR MASTER--YOU ARE AS MUCH ENTITLED TO YOUR FREEDOM AS WE ARE OR AS HE IS--BE DETERMINED AND YOU NEED HAVE NO FEARS BUT THAT YOU WILL BE PROTECTED BY THE LAW
THE PLACE WAS SO POOR THAT SOME SEASONS HE WOULD NOT RAISE TWENTY BUSHELS OF CORN AND HARDLY THREE BUSHELS OF WHEAT
ONE PAIR WOOLEN STOCKINGS 4 50 CENTS
AT THE TIME HE WAS DOING MOST FOR HUMANITY IN RESCUING BONDSMEN FROM SLAVERY SLAVE-LAWS WERE ACTUALLY BEING THE MOST RIGIDLY EXECUTED
AS HE DESCRIBED THE BRUTAL CONDUCT OF OVERSEERS IN RESORTING TO THEIR HABITUAL MODES OF TORTURING MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN IT WAS TOO PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO WITH COMPOSURE MUCH MORE TO WRITE DOWN
BEFORE HE FOUND HIS WAY OUT OF THE PRISON-HOUSE ELEVEN MONTHS ELAPSED

ALTHOUGH HIS PREDECESSOR HAD BEEN DEAD THREE YEARS DECKET NEVERTHELESS CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT TOO LATE TO FLOG THE SECRET OUT OF SOME OF THE SLAVES
SEND ME A NORFOLK PAPER OR ANY OTHER TO READ WHEN CONVENIENT
HE HAD HAD TROUBLE WITH A MAN BY THE NAME OF AMOS BARNES OR IN OTHER WORDS BARNES CLAIMED TO OWN HIM JUST AS HE OWNED A HORSE OR A MULE AND DAILY CONTROLLED HIM IN ABOUT THE SAME MANNER THAT HE WOULD MANAGE THE ANIMALS ABOVE ALLUDED TO
STRANGE PARCELS THAT WOULD RUN AWAY ON LEGS
THE FOLLOWING LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT WERE RECEIVED FROM THE UNTIRING AND DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE SLAVE LEVI COFFIN WHO FOR MANY YEARS HAD OCCUPIED IN CINCINNATI A SIMILAR POSITION TO THAT OF THOMAS GARRETT IN DELAWARE A SENTINEL AND WATCHMAN COMMISSIONED OF GOD TO SUCCOR THE FLEEING BONDMAN CINCINNATI 4TH MO 10TH 1851
WHILE THINKING HOW HE WOULD MANAGE TO GET AWAY SAFELY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE EVER PRESENT IN HIS MIND
ON OVERHAULING THEM STERN ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SURRENDER
JAMES HENRY DELANEY CAME AS A FELLOW-TRAVELER WITH JAMES EDWARD
PERHAPS HER JOY OVER HER ACHIEVED VICTORY ADDED SOMEWHAT TO HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE
INDEED THE MERCHANTS HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF THEIR SECURITY AND DESIRED THEM TO REMAIN
IT WAS A SATISFACTION TO THE COMMITTEE TO FEEL THAT THEY COULD BE THE MEDIUM IN AIDING IN THE REUNION OF MOTHER AND CHILD
BUT ROBERT AND SUE WERE UNITED AND AGREED THAT THEY COULD NOT FARE MUCH WORSE THAN THEY HAD FARED SHOULD THEY BE CAPTURED AND CARRIED BACK
I SHOULD LIKE THEE TO FEEL AT LIBERTY TO REPLACE THE REMAINDER OF THE TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FROM THE ACCOMPANYING TEN POUNDS WHICH I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN FORWARDING BUT THINK IT BETTER TO MENTION THAT IT MAY PERHAPS BE THE LAST REMITTANCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME FROM THIS QUARTER AS I DO NOT AT PRESENT SEE ANY IMMEDIATE OPENING FOR GETTING MORE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US NOW TO REALIZE WHAT REVENGE THIS CLASS DEALT TO MY FATHER FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
THEY HAD TWO HORSES TO THEIR VEHICLE AND THERE WERE THREE MEN BESIDES THOSE IN THE HOUSE
DEAR FRIEND:--THE ENCLOSED TEN DOLLARS I HAVE MADE EARNED IN TWO WEEKS AND OF COURSE IT BELONGS TO THE SLAVE
THOSE INTO WHOSE CHARGE HE HAD BEEN CONSIGNED ON THE BOAT KNEW THAT THE KETTLE AND POT-CLOSET HAD OFTEN BEEN USED FOR UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PURPOSES AND HE WAS SAFELY CONDUCTED TO QUARTERS AMONG THE POTS
THE WIDOW PIPKINS HELD THE TITLE DEED FOR JEFFERSON
THIS MISTRESS WAS SAID TO BE A CLEVER WOMAN WILLIAM JORDON ALIAS WILLIAM PRICE UNDER GOVERNOR BADGER OF NORTH CAROLINA WILLIAM HAD EXPERIENCED SLAVERY IN ITS MOST HATEFUL FORM
TUBMAN HARRIET 530
NATURALLY ENOUGH NO WILL BEING FOUND HIS EFFECTS WERE ALL ADMINISTERED UPON AND PASCAL WAS SOLD WITH THE FARM
SEND THEM ON
I USED TO HIRE MY TIME OF MY MASTER AND WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RIDE ABOUT THE COUNTRY ATTENDING TO MY BUSINESS
JOHN WILLIAM ON THIS OCCASION WAS ON HIS WAY THITHER TO SEE HOW HIS BRETHREN TOGETHER WITH THEIR OLD OPPRESSORS LOOKED FACING EACH OTHER AS FREEMEN
THE LADIES HOWEVER HAVE SOME ARTICLES ON HAND UNSOLD WHICH WILL BRING SOME MONEY ERE LONG
WHEN THE ARREST WAS MADE EUPHEMIA HAD JUST RISEN FROM HER BED AND WAS ONLY PARTLY DRESSED WHEN A LITTLE AFTER DAYLIGHT SEVERAL PERSONS ENTERED HER ROOM AND ARRESTED HER
IN HIS HEART HE RESOLVED TIME AND AGAIN THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE SOLD
IF THEY DID NOT GET WELL AS SOON AS HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HE WOULD ORDER THEM TO THEIR WORK AND IF THEY DID NOT GO HE WOULD BEAT THEM
THE MOTHER WAS FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE
TO BE IN SOME SORT AS A BROTHER TO HER SEEING THERE WAS NO BROTHER IN THE HOUSE
THE CASE OF A FUGITIVE FROM LABOR IS A CASE IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS HANDED OVER SOMETIMES TO A MERCILESS MASTER AND VERY RARELY TO A CHARITABLE ONE

STILL:--THE BEARER OF THIS GEORGE WILMER IS A SLAVE WHOSE RESIDENCE IS IN MARYLAND
WHICH PATROL SHALL BE IN SERVICE AT SUCH TIMES AND SUCH STATIONS AS THE COURT SHALL DIRECT BY THEIR ORDER AFORESAID
FROM THE BOSTON JOURNAL BOSTON MASS THE PRESENT VOLUME IS A NARRATIVE OR RATHER A COLLECTION OF NARRATIVES OF THE ADVENTURES OF SLAVES ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM
THE PREVIOUS ACTION IN THE CASE IS NOT A TRIAL AND CANNOT CONVICT WHATEVER BE THE EVIDENCE OR THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES
HIS WIFE WHOSE NAME WAS HANNAH HAD THREE CHILDREN--SLAVES--THEIR NAMES WERE SAM DAN AND BABY THE NAME OF THE LATTER WAS UNKNOWN TO HIM
THE THRONG FINALLY RETIRED AND LEFT GEORGE HANGING IN MORTAL AGONY
AND AMONG THE SIGNATURES TO ITS DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS THE NAME OF ROBERT PURVIS IS TO BE SEEN
I ARRIVED IN THE CITY OF HAMILTON ON THE 15TH FEBRUARY 1860 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AND THE WEATHER WAS DREARY AND COLD AND THE CARS LAID OVER THERE UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK NEXT DAY AND I WENT UP INTO THE CITY AND SAW A PORTION OF IT
I FORGOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT HER WHEN I WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS HE BROKE DOWN AGAIN AND WAS SICK
I UNDERSTAND THAT MRS HUNT HAS BEEN TO RICHMOND VA
CHESTNUT COLOR
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THAT I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEVER
O WHAT WILL YOUR AUNT SAY
THIS ASSOCIATION WAS AFTERWARDS AMPLIFIED IN NAME AND SCOPE INTO THE AMERICAN FREEDMAN'S UNION COMMISSION AND MR MCKIM CONTINUED WITH IT AS CORRESPONDING SECRETARY LABORING FOR RECONSTRUCTION BY MEANS OF FREEDMAN'S SCHOOLS AND IMPARTIAL POPULAR EDUCATION
HE LEFT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM WHERE THEY WERE SECRETED AND GOT ROUND TO THEM AND HURRIED THEM OFF TO A PLACE OF SAFETY AS HE WAS AFRAID TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR FEAR THEY WOULD SEARCH THE HOUSE
MY WIFE BELONGS TO ELSON BURDEL'S ESTATE
THOMPSON CHARLES 316
ON THE OTHER HAND MASSEY WAS TALKING LOUDLY OF SELLING THEM AGAIN
THAT I THINK WILL BE FOUND IMPRACTICABLE
BUT NO FRIENDS I AM MISTAKEN
YOU MUST COME DOWN TO THE STEAMER ABOUT DARK SAID THE AGENT AND IF ALL IS RIGHT YOU WILL SEE THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT COME OUT WITH SOME ASHES AS A SIGNAL AND BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT ALL IS READY I WILL BE THERE CERTAIN SAID HENRY
INTENSE INTEREST WAS MANIFESTED DURING THE PROCEEDINGS AND MUCH SYMPATHY IN BEHALF OF DR PENNINGTON
HE IS ABOUT 24 YEARS OF AGE AND 5 FEET 4 INCHES HIGH
BEING RATHER OF A RARE TYPE OF SLAVE-HOLDERS SHE IS ENTITLED TO SPECIAL CREDIT
HE CAN BE FOUND OUT BY SEEING FOUNTAIN TOMBS WHO BELONGS TO MR RUTHERFORD AND IF YOU SHOULD NOT SEE HIM THERE IS JAMES TURNER WHO LIVES AT THE GOVERNORS PLEASE TO SEE CAPTAIN BAYLISS AND TELL HIM TO TAKE THESE DIRECTIONS AND GO TO JOHN HILL IN PETERSBURGH AND HE MAY FIND HIM
SO IN HIS JUDGMENT HE FELT THAT HIS ONLY HOPE LAY IN MAKING HIS ESCAPE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
MCKIERNON B 34
SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MR MCKIM SECRETARY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY LUCRETIA MOTT AND GEORGE CORSON ONE OF OUR MOST MANLY AND INTREPID POLICE OFFICERS
AND WHERE THE BONDMAN DRAGGED HIS CHAIN THERE FREEDOM IS ESTABLISHED FOR EVER
WILLIAM WAS OF A CHESTNUT COLOR WELL MADE AND WOULD HAVE COMMANDED UNDER THE HAMMER A HIGH PRICE IF HIS APPARENT INTELLIGENCE HAD NOT DAMAGED HIM
FOR THAT HIDDEN STRENGTH WHICH CAN NERVE UNTO DEATH THE INNER MAN
MASSA JOHN THE ELDER BOY 11 YEARS OF AGE TOOK THE MATTER MORE DISPASSIONATELY AND THE MOTHER QUITE CALMLY
THEY COULD NOT FORCE A LOSS OF PROPERTY OR OF LIFE IT IS TRUE
AND PARTLY FROM THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL CASES EVEN AMONG THOSE SO OMITTED THAT WOULD BE EQUALLY AS INTERESTING AS MANY WHICH HAVE BEEN INSERTED TIME AND SPACE WILL NOT ADMIT OF FURTHER ENCROACHMENT
FOREVER WILL HE REMEMBER JAMES HURST HIS SO-CALLED MASTER WHO WAS A VERY BLUSTERING MAN OFT-TIMES AND IN THE HABIT OF ABUSING HIS SLAVES

A SHADOW HAS BEEN CAST OVER OUR HOME CIRCLES AND A CHECK BEEN GIVEN TO THE WONTED CHEERFULNESS OF OUR FAMILIES
WHEN THE TRIALS WERE CONCLUDED MR GARRETT AROSE THE COURT BEING ADJOURNED MADE A SPEECH OF AN HOUR TO THE LARGE CROWD IN THE COURT-ROOM IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE DECLARED HIS INTENTION TO REDOUBLE HIS EXERTIONS SO HELP HIM GOD
OF THE COMMON ILLS OF SLAVE LIFE GEORGE COULD SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE
I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD WHEN SHE DIED
THUS FAR HIS ESCAPE WOULD SEEM NOT TO AFFECT HIS PARENTS NOR WAS IT APPARENT THAT THERE WAS ANY OTHER CAUSE WHY THE OWNER SHOULD REVENGE HIMSELF UPON THEM
YOU SHALL NOT SO MANAGE THINGS AT HOME AS EVERY FEW YEARS TO BRING BANKRUPTCY UPON OUR COUNTRY
THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE SOLD ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER HAD HEARD HER FATHER'S CONVERSATION WITH THE CONSTABLE ACCORDINGLY SHE SENT WORD ON FIRST-DAY MORNING TO MY REVERED FRIEND THOMAS GARRETT OF WILMINGTON FIVE MILES DISTANT IN REGARD TO THE MATTER INVITING HIM TO SEE THE FUGITIVES
MOSES WAS A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE QUITE DARK AND GAVE PROMISE OF BEING CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF HIMSELF IN FREEDOM
HOW SHE FELT WHEN SHE LEARNED OF HER HUSBAND'S ESCAPE IS FOR THE IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
MY CHILD YOU ARE HERE
HE STARTED ON THE EVENING OF THE SIXTH DAY AND TRAVELED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO DOVER IN THE MIDST OF A SEASON UNUSUALLY COLD AND INCLEMENT
IN THIS BELIEF HE WAS NOT FAR FROM BEING CORRECT FOR CHARLES SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN EITHER OF THESE THREE PLACES FROM THE DAY OF HIS ESCAPE UNTIL THE DAY THAT HE FINALLY EMBARKED
LEFT A BROTHER AND SISTER IN SLAVERY
HE WORKED AT TASK WORK TWO MONTHS BEING OBLIGED TO WHEEL SIXTEEN SQUARE YARDS PER DAY
SUBSEQUENTLY SHE WAS PURCHASED AND SOLD BY DIFFERENT TRADERS WHO DESIGNED TO SPECULATE UPON HER AS A FANCY ARTICLE THEY WOULD DRESS HER VERY ELEGANTLY IN ORDER TO SHOW HER OFF TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE POSSIBLE BUT IT APPEARS THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH REGARD FOR HER HUSBAND AND HER HONOR TO CONSENT TO FILL THE POSITIONS WHICH HAD BEEN BASELY ASSIGNED HER BY HER OWNERS
AND THAT WAS THE LAST SO FAR AS I KNOW THAT HAS EVER BEEN HEARD OF HIM
AND AFTER ALL IT IS ONE OF WOMAN'S MOST SACRED RIGHTS TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF FORMING THE SYMMETRY AND RIGHTLY ADJUSTING THE MENTAL BALANCE OF AN IMMORTAL MIND I HAVE WRITTEN A LECTURE ON EDUCATION AND I AM ALSO WRITING A SMALL BOOK THUS WHILST FILLING HER VOCATION AS A TEACHER IN LITTLE YORK WAS SHE DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN THOUGHT AS TO HOW SHE COULD BEST PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF HER RACE
AFTER BEING THERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF PRISON HANDCUFFED BY ONE WINTERS WHO TOOK HIM AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS TO WASHINGTON AND THENCE TO CHARLESTON S.C
HE CONFERRED NOT WITH FLESH AND BLOOD BUT MADE A DETERMINED STROKE FOR FREEDOM
IN STATURE HE WAS ONLY ORDINARY
WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT
NOR IS EVEN HIS PERSONAL PRESENCE INDISPENSABLE
AND WHEN REPROACHED WITH SLAVERY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE WORLD WITH AN OPEN FRONT AND A CLEAR CONSCIENCE OUR GENERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT EITHER TO PROMOTE TO SUSTAIN TO DEFEND TO SANCTION OR TO APPROVE
THEY HAVE SUCH A VARIETY OF CLOTHING THAT IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
THE DELIVERER OF BOX BROWN--MEETING OF THE COLORED CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA

AND CONCLUDED BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WOULD RATHER GIVE HER A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HELP HER OFF THAN TO DO AUGHT TO MAKE KNOWN HER WHEREABOUTS IF HE KNEW EVER SO MUCH ABOUT HER WHAT FURTHER STEPS WERE TAKEN BY THE DISCOMFITED DIVINE THE MISTRESS OR HER BOARDING-HOUSE SYMPATHIZERS THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT INFORMED
WE HAVE LAID THE CASE BEFORE A FEW KIND FRIENDS AND ALREADY HAD THE PLEASURE OF FORWARDING L8 TO MR FEE'S CARE ON BEHALF OF HIS VALUED YOUNG FRIEND ELIZABETH RAWLINGS
AND I HAVE LIVED TO SEE THE DAY WHEN THE PLANTATION HAS PASSED INTO NEW HANDS AND THESE HANDS ONCE WORE THE FETTERS OF SLAVERY
I THEN MADE UP MY MIND TO PUT MY CASE IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND START FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
SAID ONE WHO LOOKED
EVANS WHO WAS THEN IN THE SENATE OF PENNSYLVANIA BROUGHT THE MATTER BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED JUDGES CAMPBELL AND BELL THE LATTER OF OUR COUNTY TO DEFEND THESE TWO POOR COLORED GIRLS THUS FOULLY KIDNAPPED
TO SEE THE ARM OF A BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH YOUNG LADY PASSED THROUGH THAT OF A NIGGER TAKING ICES AND OTHER REFRESHMENTS WITH HIM UPON TERMS OF THE MOST PERFECT EQUALITY CERTAINLY WAS ENOUGH TO RILE AND EVIDENTLY DID RILE THE SLAVE-HOLDERS WHO BEHELD IT
HIS MASTER EVIDENTLY SUPPOSED THAT JACK WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO WISH TO SEE HIS WIFE EVEN IN A FREE STATE AND THAT NO SLAVE WITH SUCH AN UNNATURAL DESIRE COULD BE TOLERATED OR TRUSTED THAT THE SOONER SUCH ARTICLES WERE TURNED INTO CASH THE BETTER
THE COMPANY'S NAME IS QUEEN VICTORIA'S RIFLE GUARDS
WHILE NONE IN THIS CATALOGUE BELONGED TO THE CLASS WHOSE DARING ADVENTURES RENDERED THEIR NARRATIVES MARVELLOUS NEVERTHELESS THEY REPRESENTED A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY ON THE ALERT TO GET RID OF THEIR CAPTIVITY
I HAVE THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE ABOUT OUR CONDITION IN THIS COUNTRY SEEING THAT THE WEATHER WAS SO VERY FAVERABLE TO US
ACCORDINGLY HE TOOK TO HIMSELF ANOTHER PARTNER THE ONE WHO NOW ACCOMPANIED HIM ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HOW MUCH I WISH THE POOR THING COULD BE SECRETED IN SOME SAFE PLACE TILL SHE IS ABLE TO TRAVEL NORTHWARD
STILL MY DEAR FRIEND:--I HAVE THE HEART BUT NOT THE TIME TO WRITE YOU A LONG LETTER
A HEAVENLY SUNSHINE LIGHTING UP THE DARK VALLEY AND SHADOW OF DEATH NOTWITHSTANDING THIS YEARNING FOR HOME SHE WAS FAR FROM DESIRING AT HER DEATH A BURIAL IN A SLAVE STATE AS THE FOLLOWING CLEARLY EXPRESSED VIEWS SHOW
TWO SMALL APRONS 1 25 CENTS
GILLIAM WM
NOR DID THEY ESCAPE THE GNAWINGS OF HUNGER TRAVELING DAY AND NIGHT
SHE WITH OUR SIX CHILDREN LIVED A LONG DISTANCE FROM MY MASTER'S PLACE AND HE WOULD NOT HIRE ME OUT WHERE I COULD LIVE NEAR MY WIFE SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD TRY AND DO BETTER
HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE SOCIETY THERE WOULD FURNISH HIM THE MEANS TO GO AFTER THEM FROM PHILADELPHIA THAT YOU WILL BE RUNNING NO RISK IN DOING THIS
EIGHT HAD BEEN SOLD BY HIM SOME TIME BEFORE THIS PARTY ESCAPED TWO OF THEM TO GEORGIA
FIELD HENRY 509
NOTWITHSTANDING THE MASS OF EVIDENCE GIVEN TO SHOW THE PRISONER'S GUILT IN UNLAWFULLY HAVING IN HIS POSSESSION THESE DOCUMENTS AND THE NINE-TENTHS OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HE LIVED BELIEVED THAT HE HAD A HAND IN THE RUNNING AWAY OF SLAVES IT WAS THE OPINION OF THE COURT THAT THE LAW UNDER WHICH HE WAS INDICTED WAS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE CASE AND THAT HE MUST ACCORDINGLY RENDER A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY

THIS INTERVIEW INTERESTED CONCKLIN MOST DEEPLY
THIS WAS A LARGER NUMBER THAN MR DENNY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PERFORM BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS SEIZED WITH EMBARRASSMENT
THEY WERE DAILY LIVING ON THE FAITH THUS CREATED AND OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT THE SOONER THE LORD RELIEVED THE OLD MISTRESS OF HER EARTHLY TROUBLES THE BETTER
FROM THIS POINT THEREFORE WE SHALL PRESENT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OF HER LIFE FROM INFANCY AND VERY NEARLY WORD FOR WORD AS SHE RELATED THEM
SHE REFUSED TO DO SO BECAUSE SHE FELT TOO MUCH ATTACHMENT TO THEM
THE OTHER PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMAN DR H WAS NOW APPEALED TO BUT HIS ENGAGEMENTS IN THE COLLEGE FORBADE HIS ABSENCE BEFORE ABOUT THANKSGIVING DAY WHICH WAS THEN SIX WEEKS OFF
I AM GLAD TO TELL YOU THAT WE FEEL IT A GREAT VICTORY OVER THE SLAVE POWER TO BE ABLE TO RISE AGAIN FROM OUR RUINS AND IN THE FACE OF SLAVE-OWNING DESPOTS DENOUNCE THEIR INHUMANITY AND THEIR SINS
WILMINGTON 6 MO 9TH 1857
YET THEY GOT ALONG TOLERABLY WELL AND WERE MUCH CHEERED BY THE ATTENTION AND AID THEY RECEIVED FROM THE COMMITTEE
THE HOUR FIXED TO LEAVE VIRGINIA ARRIVED AND HE STARTED AND SUCCEEDED IN REACHING PHILADELPHIA AND THE COMMITTEE

FREEMAN AUBURN CITY CAYUGA COUNTY NEW YORK
A NAME-SAKE OF HIS BY THE NAME OF LEWIS BROWN LIVING IN WASHINGTON ACCORDING TO THE SLAVE CODE OF THAT CITY HAD JACOB IN FETTERS AND WAS EXERCISING ABOUT THE SAME CONTROL OVER HIM THAT HE EXERCISED OVER CATTLE AND HORSES

BUT THE DEADLY GANGRENE HAS TAKEN SUCH DEEP AND ALMOST FATAL HOLD UPON THE NATION THAT THE VERY CENTRES OF ITS LIFE SEEM TO BE INVOLVED IN ITS ERADICATION

BY THE WAY JANE HAD IT DEEP IN HER HEART BEFORE LEAVING THE SOUTH AND WAS BENT ON SUCCEEDING IN NEW YORK IF DISAPPOINTED IN PHILADELPHIA
HE THEN SAID HE HAD CORRESPONDENCE WITH A PERSON HERE FOR A MONTH OR TWO AND HE HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT SEVERAL OF HIS NEGROES WERE HERE FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM HIS CORRESPONDENT
FOR HIS RECOVERY IF TAKEN IN A SLAVE STATE I WILL GIVE $200
HE WAS AN ABOLITIONIST OF THE MOST RADICAL AND PRONOUNCED CHARACTER THOUGH A RESIDENT OF A SLAVE STATE AND THROUGH ALL THE PERIOD WHEREIN TO BE AN ABOLITIONIST WAS TO PUT IN JEOPARDY NOT ONLY REPUTATION AND PROPERTY BUT LIFE ITSELF
MY FATHER WAS AT THAT TIME IN SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS IN BOSTON BUT WITH HIS VIEWS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING A WOMAN TO USEFULNESS HE AND MY MOTHER GAVE THEIR CONSENT TO ANOTHER YEAR BEING DEVOTED TO THAT INSTITUTION HERE IS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THE IMMEASURABLE VALUE OF WISE PARENTAL INFLUENCE

BUT MY MASTER WAS CROSS AND SAID THAT HE INTENDED TO SELL ME--TO DO BETTER BY ME ANOTHER YEAR
IN THIS BOOK HE HAS NOTED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR OCCURRENCE SUCH INSTANCES OF DIFFICULTY OR DISTRESS AS DEMANDED HIS INTERFERENCE ALMOST WITHOUT A COMMENT
IN REFERENCE TO THE PHILADELPHIA VIGILANCE COMMITTEE WE ARE SAFE IN SAYING THAT EXCEPT FROM A FEW SOURCES NO DIRECT AID CAME
SLAVES SOMETIMES WHEN WANTING TO GET AWAY WOULD MAKE THEIR OWNERS BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE VERY HAPPY AND CONTENTED
INADVERTENTLY AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL THE NAMES OF THE STATE AND PLACE WHENCE THEY FLED WERE NOT ENTERED ON THE BOOK
THAT THIS PLEDGE WAS FAITHFULLY KEPT BY HUNN THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS HE CONTINUED STEADFAST AT HIS POST UNTIL THE LAST FETTER WAS BROKEN BY THE GREAT PROCLAMATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WHEN THE RICH AND THE POOR SHOULD KNOW NO DISTINCTION
HAVING LIVED IN THE SOUTH HE CLAIMED TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE WORKINGS OF THE OPPRESSIVE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY GENERALLY AND DECLARED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY EXPOSURES OF THE EVIL WHICH CAME UNDER HIS OWN OBSERVATION THE MOST VIVID DESCRIPTIONS FELL FAR SHORT OF THE REALITIES HIS OWN EYES HAD WITNESSED

BUT YOU NO DOUBT HAVE HAD MANY MORE THAN THAT
IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER IN SPITE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ALONG
INDEED HIS CONDUCT PROVED THE SINCERITY OF THIS DECLARATION AS HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CONCEALED FIVE MONTHS IN A PLACE IN THE CITY WHERE HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY AVOID DAILY SUFFERING OF THE MOST TRYING KIND
HE SYMPATHIZED WITH THEM DEEPLY BUT FELT THAT HE COULD RENDER THEM NO REAL GOOD BY REMAINING
HILL GEO 416
AS SHE IS A FREE WOMAN THERE WILL DOUBTLESS BE NO DIFFICULTY IN HER COMING RIGHT THROUGH
SHOWS HIS TEETH VERY MUCH WHEN HE LAUGHS
TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD HE SOON FOUND AN AGENT WHO COMMUNICATED HIS WISHES TO ONE OF THE COLORED WOMEN RUNNING AS COOK OR CHAMBERMAID ON ONE OF THE PHILADELPHIA AND RICHMOND STEAMERS AND SHE WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIM AND FOUND HIM A SAFE BERTH IN ONE OF THE CLOSETS WHERE THE POTS AND OTHER COOKING UTENSILS BELONGED
I AM GLAD I ESCAPED FROM SLAVERY HE THEN GAVE HIS NAME AND TRIED TO TELL THE NAME OF HIS MASTER BUT WAS SO WEAK HE COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD
I WAS RAISED IN CHESTER COUNTY IN 1824 AND HAVE BEEN HERE ABOUT FIVE YEARS
IT IS HARDLY TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT PENNSYLVANIA WAS CONSIDERED WHOLLY UNSAFE TO NINE-TENTHS OF HER COLORED POPULATION
APPEARED BY NIGHT
HAD BEEN CAPTAIN OF ONE OF HIS OYSTER-BOATS UNTIL RECENTLY
STILL:--_KINE SIR_:--I AM HAPPY TO SAY TO YOU THAT I HAVE JUS RESEVED MY LETTER DATED 5 OF THE PRESENT MONTH BUT PREVIEOUSLY HAD BIN IN FORM LAS NIGHT BY MR J.H
THE FOLLOWING LETTER SHOWS THE FEARLESS MANNER IN WHICH HE ATTENDED TO THE DUTIES OF HIS STATION
WILLIAM STILL:--DEAR SIR:--ENCLOSED ARE $2,00 TO PAY FREIGHTAGE ON THE BOX OF BEDDING WEARING APPAREL ETC THAT HAS BEEN SENT TO YOUR ADDRESS
LEAH IS ABOUT 28 YEARS OLD ABOUT FIVE FEET HIGH DARK CHESNUT COLLER WITH THREE CHILDREN
HAVING THUS SHOWN THEIR FAITH BY THEIR WORKS IT WOULD BE UNJUST NOT TO MAKE HONORABLE MENTION OF THEM
LETTER FROM J.B."--LETTERS FROM E.L
I SPENT LAST EVENING WITH HIM
THE EXAMINING COMMITTEE WERE VERY DESIROUS OF HEARING THEIR STORY WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY
HE COULD NOT SEE HOW HIS LOT COULD BE MADE MORE MISERABLE BY ATTEMPTING TO FLEE
BUT THE SIZE OF THE BOX WAS TOO LARGE FOR THE CARRIAGE AND THE DRIVER REFUSED TO TAKE IT
AT FIRST I DOUBT NOT BUT THAT YOU WILL THINK MY APPEAL VERY UNREASONABLE
BOLDAN CHAS
IT WAS A SAD REFLECTION
BUT WHAT WAS AT THAT TIME THE TEMPER OF THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM HE LIVED OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GLORYING NOW AS THEY WELL MAY GLORY IN THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY
UPON THE WHOLE THEIR LOT IN SLAVERY HAD BEEN RATHER MORE FAVORABLE THAN THE AVERAGE RUN OF SLAVES
CHARLES GIBBONS WAS ENGAGED TO DEFEND WILLIAM STILL AND WILLIAM S
IN THIS PARTICULAR PLACE OF SECLUSION HE REMAINED FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS TWO DAYS SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM HUNGER COLD AND THIRST HOWEVER ONE WHO WAS A FRIEND TO HIM AND KNEW OF HIS WHEREABOUTS MANAGED TO GET SOME FOOD TO HIM AND CONSOLING WORDS
IT IS SAID TOO THAT THE TIME AND MANNER OF THESE OUTRAGES THEIR ASSERTED OBJECT THE DENUNCIATIONS BY WHICH THEY WERE PRECEDED AND THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF MOST OF THE GUILTY PARTIES EVINCED A COMBINED PURPOSE FORCIBLY TO RESIST AND MAKE NUGATORY A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND THE STATUTES ENACTED IN PURSUANCE OF IT
I SHALL CARRY SHOT IN ME TO MY GRAVE
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT IN THE HEART OF HENRY TO GIVE HIS MASTER ANY OTHER THAN A BAD NAME
LAUGHTER IT IS INDEED TRUE SIR THAT I HAVE HAD NO OTHER RULE BY WHICH TO BE GUIDED THAN THIS
AFTER CONFERRING WITH HARRY CRAIGE WE HAVE CONCLUDED TO SEND FIVE OR SIX OF THEM TONIGHT IN THE CARS AND THE BALANCE IF THOSE GO SAFE TO-MORROW NIGHT OR IN THE STEAM-BOAT ON SECOND DAY MORNING DIRECTED TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE

HIS SAFE ARRIVAL THEREFORE WAS ATTENDED WITH UNUSUAL REJOICING
MAJOR LATHAM WAS FORTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE MULATTO VERY RESOLUTE WITH GOOD NATURAL ABILITIES AND A DECIDED HATER OF SLAVERY
PENNYPACKER WAS SURELY AMONGST THEM
JOHN T
IT WAS THIS HEROIC PURPOSE TO PROTECT THE WEAK AND HELPLESS AT ANY COST THIS FEARLESS UNSELFISH ACTION NOT STOPPING TO WEIGH THE CONTINGENCIES OF INDIVIDUAL GAIN OR LOSS THAT CONSTITUTES HIS BEST TITLE TO THE GRATITUDE OF THOSE HE SERVED AND TO THE ADMIRATION AND RESPECT OF ALL WHO CAN APPRECIATE INDEPENDENT CONDUCT SPRINGING FROM PURE AND LOFTY MOTIVES
I MAY AS A CITIZEN OF A FREE STATE BLUSH AT THE HUMILIATING FACT THAT NOT ONLY THE TYRANNY BUT THE UBIQUITY OF THE SLAVE POWER IS EVERYWHERE SO MANIFEST
HE WAS NOT WITH THEM WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN
NEVERTHELESS HE WAS DECENTLY BURIED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LEBANON CEMETERY
GREAT ANXIETY AND CARE

ULTIMATELY HOWEVER THE MORNING OF HIS ARDENT HOPES DAWNED

THE FIRST NUMBER OF THAT PAPER ISSUED ON THE 1ST JANUARY 1831 CONTAINED AN ADDRESS TO THE PUBLIC ONE PASSAGE OF WHICH I HAVE OFTEN READ WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST AND IT IS A KEY TO THE FUTURE LIFE OF MR GARRISON
SLAVES CAUGHT OUT OF AN EVENING WITHOUT PASSES FROM THEIR MASTER OR MISTRESS WERE INVARIABLY ARRESTED AND IF THEY WERE UNABLE TO RAISE MONEY TO BUY THEMSELVES OFF THEY WERE TAKEN AND LOCKED UP IN A PLACE KNOWN AS THE CAGE AND IN THE MORNING THE OWNER WAS NOTIFIED AND AFTER PAYING THE FINE THE UNFORTUNATE PRISONER HAD TO GO TO MEET HIS FATE AT THE HANDS OF HIS OWNER OFTEN HE OR SHE FOUND HIMSELF OR HERSELF SENTENCED TO TAKE THIRTY-NINE OR MORE LASHES BEFORE ATONEMENT COULD BE MADE FOR THE VIOLATED LAW AND THE FINE SUSTAINED BY THE ENRAGED OWNER

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER TWO WITNESSES FOR THE CLAIMANT WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE RESPONDENT FOR TWENTY-THREE ONE FOR TWENTY-FOUR YEARS ARE TO BE BELIEVED IN PREFERENCE TO FOUR WITNESSES ON THE OTHER SIDE THREE OF WHOM HAVE SEEN HER FREQUENTLY SINCE 1826 AND KNOWN HER AS EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS AND THE FOURTH WHO HAS NOT SEEN HER FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BUT TESTIFIES THAT WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN THEY USED TO JEST EACH OTHER ABOUT SCARS WHICH THEY STILL BEAR UPON THEIR PERSONS

AS HE ASSERTED AND AS HIS APPEARANCE INDICATED HE HAD EXPERIENCED A LARGE SHARE OF RUGGED USAGE

THE RECORD MAKES NO MENTION OF CRUEL TREATMENT OR VERY HARD USAGE AS A SLAVE

IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THEY KNEW MUCH ABOUT THE ROADS NEVERTHELESS THEY REACHED WILMINGTON DELAWARE PRETTY DIRECT AND VENTURED UP INTO THE HEART OF THE TOWN IN CARRIAGES LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO MEETING TO HEAR AN OLD-FASHIONED SOUTHERN SERMON--"SERVANTS OBEY YOUR MASTERS OF COURSE THE DISTINGUISHED TRAVELERS WERE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE NOTED THOMAS GARRETT WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TRANSACT THE AFFAIRS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IN A COOL MASTERLY WAY

CHARLES RATTRAY A VALUABLE SCOTCH MISSIONARY IN THAT COLONY WAS IN ENGLAND LAST SPRING AND WENT BACK TO HIS ADOPTED COUNTRY WITH HIS MIND FULL FRAUGHT WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF COTTON GROWING WITHIN ITS BORDERS
AFTER A SEVERE STRUGGLE HE REVIVED BUT ONLY TO ENCOUNTER A THIRD ORDEAL NO LESS PAINFUL THAN THE ONE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD JUST PASSED
I AM POSITIVE IT WAS BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1828
THEIR MASTER WAS TO TAKE OR SEND THEM THERE AND HE WANTED ME TO SEND FOR THEM
A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS SIGNED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE STATE AND DEMANDING THE BODY OF THE PRISONER BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT AT ITS NEXT TERM WAS NOW PRODUCED

DICKINSON BENJ 325
HER ABILITY AND LABORS WERE EVERYWHERE APPRECIATED AND HER MEETINGS LARGELY ATTENDED
SO AFTER PLACING JANE WHERE HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE PRETTY SECURE FROM EVIL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE COLORED WAITERS AND AFTER GIVING HER A DOUBLE COUNSELLING HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE TABLE
AS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF STEADY HABITS A HUSBAND AND FATHER AND WITHAL AN ARDENT LOVER OF LIBERTY

I DON'T WISH TO HAVE YOU TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT MY CLOTHES I AM IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN GET ALL THE CLOTHES I WANT OR NEED
HENCE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
BUT AS SHE WAS DEVOTED TO THE WORK IN HAND SHE SOON FOUND THAT FIFTY-THREE UNTRAINED LITTLE URCHINS OVERTAXED HER NATURALLY DELICATE PHYSICAL POWERS
HE SAID THAT HE WAS TREATED FIRST-RATE IN WASHINGTON AND BALTIMORE HE COULD RECOMMEND BOTH OF THESE CITIES
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS PREVIOUS TO HIS ESCAPE HE HAD BEEN BRINGING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THE COFFERS OF HIS OWNERS
FOR SHE WAS VERY EXACTING AND OPPRESSIVE IN REGARD TO THE TASKS SHE WAS DAILY IN THE HABIT OF LAYING UPON LEAR'S SHOULDERS WITH NO DISPOSITION WHATEVER TO ALLOW HER ANY LIBERTIES
THE FIRST SHE ADMITTED WAS KIND TO HER BUT THE LATTER WAS CRUEL AFTER ARRIVING IN CANADA SHE WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A COMBINATION OR CONSPIRING TOGETHER TO OPPOSE THE LAW BY FORCE AND SOME ACTUAL FORCE MUST HAVE BEEN EXERTED OR THE CRIME OF TREASON IS NOT CONSUMMATED
THERE IS A STORY THAT THE SLAVE-HUNTERS HAVE BEEN HIS TABLE-GUESTS ALSO AND WHETHER HE BAILED THEM OR NOT WE DON'T KNOW
THERE AND THEN HE AVOWED HIS ENTIRE SYMPATHY WITH THE SLAVE AND DECLARED THAT IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST BY THE HELP OF GOD HE WOULD NEVER WITHHOLD A HELPING HAND FROM THE DOWN-TRODDEN IN THE HOUR OF DISTRESS
HAVING A SISTER LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA WHO WAS KNOWN TO THE AGENT IN NORFOLK SARAH WAS ASKED ONE DAY IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE HER SISTER

MR MCKIM'S LONG AND ASSIDUOUS CAREER IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE HAS GIVEN EVIDENCE OF A PECULIAR FITNESS IN HIM FOR THE FUNCTIONS HE SUCCESSIVELY DISCHARGED
SUCH WERE ALWAYS DOUBLY WELCOME
SHE NEEDS NOTHING MORE
IN SPEAKING OF HIS MISTRESS HE SAID THAT SHE WAS A RIGHT FINE WOMAN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HIS SUFFERINGS IN THE KENDALL FAMILY HE SEEMED WILLING TO DO JUSTICE TO HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS INDIVIDUALLY
SCARCELY LESS PAINFUL TO THE COMMITTEE WAS THE NEWS OF THIS ACCIDENT THAN THE NEWS OF A DISASTER RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF SEVERAL LIVES ON THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY ROAD WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ITS MANAGERS

I LEFT THAT PLACE AT SIX O'CLOCK

THY ANSWER IN REGARD TO IMPOSTORS IS QUITE SATISFACTORY
WHETHER SHE EVER AFTERWARDS HEARD FROM HER HUSBAND IS A QUESTION

BUT ANTHONY HAD TO TAKE THE MATTER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO DO
THEY STOPT AT ELMIRA FROM MONDAY NIGHT TILL THIS MORNING HOPING THAT LUCY BELL WOULD COME UP AND JOIN THEM AT THAT PLACE
ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO GEORGE HAD BEEN ON A VISIT TO OUR BROTHER CHARLES LIVING AT THE FORK OF THE SKIPPACK AND PERKIOMEN CREEKS IN THIS COUNTY AND ON HIS RETURN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHILE COMING ALONG AN OBSCURE ROAD NOT THE MAIN DIRECT ROAD HE CAME UP TO A MAN ON HORSEBACK WHO WAS FOLLOWED AT A DISTANCE OF A FEW FEET BY A COLORED MAN WITH A ROPE TIED AROUND HIS NECK AND THE OTHER END HELD BY THE PERSON ON HORSEBACK

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND 1860
THE CONFUSION AND DIFFICULTIES INTO WHICH THEY HAD FALLEN BY HAVING TO TRAVEL AN INDIRECT ROUTE WERE FULLY EXPLAINED AND TO THE HEARTY MERRIMENT OF THE COMMITTEE AND STRANGERS THE DILEMMA OF THEIR GOOD QUAKER FRIEND GOODWIN AT SALEM WAS ALLUDED TO
ROBERT MCCOY ALIAS WILLIAM DONAR AND ELIZABETH SANDERS ARRIVED PER STEAMER
THEREFORE WAS HE ENLISTED IN THE CAUSE OF EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER TWO SISTERS AND THREE BROTHERS IN SLAVERY

WILLIAM GRIFFEN HENRY MOOR JAMES CAMPER NOAH ENNELLS AND LEVIN PARKER
IT IS A QUESTION WHICH I VERILY BELIEVE THE AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY SO FAR AS THEY MAY HAVE YIELDED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPENLY OR SILENTLY TO A CORRUPT PUBLIC SENTIMENT ON THIS SUBJECT WILL HAVE TO ANSWER AT THE BAR OF HIM WHO HAS DECLARED THAT IF YE HAVE RESPECT TO PERSONS YE COMMIT SIN AND THAT INASMUCH AS YE DID IT NOT TO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE YE DID IT NOT TO ME THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTIANITY IS A SPIRIT OF UNIVERSAL LOVE AND PHILANTHROPY
THUS SHE BEGAN LIFE IN FREEDOM ANEW
SMITH ROBT 217
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM WHICH HE FLED HE LEFT HIS FATHER MOTHER AND TWO SISTERS EACH HAVING DIFFERENT OWNERS
FOR NOT ONLY DID HIS PRIMITIVE DRESS HIS BROAD-BRIMMED HAT AND HIS ANTIQUE SHOE BUCKLES ATTRACT ATTENTION BUT THE BEAUTY AND BENEVOLENCE OF HIS FACE WAS SURE TO FIX THE EYE OF ORDINARY DISCERNMENT
JOE ALSO LEFT TWO SISTERS ONE FREE THE OTHER A SLAVE
MRS CRANE HER MISTRESS HAD ALWAYS PROMISED JULIA THAT SHE SHOULD BE FREE AT HER DEATH
LETTER FROM S.H
OF COURSE MENTALLY HE WAS UNDEVELOPED NEVERTHELESS POSSESSED OF ENOUGH MOTHER-WIT TO MAKE GOOD HIS ESCAPE
SINCE I LEFT EUFAULA I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING OF PLANTATION LIFE
WE GIVE THEM SUPPER LODGING AND BREAKFAST
JACKSON
IF YOU PREFER FREEDOM TO SLAVERY AS WE SUPPOSE EVERYBODY DOES YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO ACCEPT IT NOW
YES I WANT HER TO COME THEN I WILL BE BETTER SATISFIED
HE FLED FROM NEWARK
WILLIAM CRAFT ILLUSTRATION
HIS ATTENTION WAS FIRST DIRECTED TO THE INIQUITY OF SLAVERY WHILE HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE
PENNINGTON D.D WITH HIS TWO SONS
BUT I CONSIDER IT A SIGNAL DISTINCTION TO BE PERMITTED TO TAKE A PROMINENT PART IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS DAY WHICH ARE INTENDED TO COMMEMORATE ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE GREAT TRIUMPHS OF FREEDOM AND TO DO HONOR TO A MOST EMINENT INSTRUMENT IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT FREEDOM
ALSO THAT THE SAID MASSEY HAD A WIFE WHO WAS A VERY TALL WOMAN WITH BLUE EYES CHESTNUT-COLORED HAIR AND A VERY BAD TEMPER
ONE OF THE MEN ASKED THE OWNER OF THE BARN IF HE HAD ANY LONG STRAW
BY ADDING THAT HE WAS EXCESSIVELY CLOSE IN MONEY MATTERS
INDEED HIS PLACE WAS HARD TO FILL
I LAST SAW HER IN 1827 SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN
SOLOMON WAS ONLY TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE RATHER UNDER THE MEDIUM SIZE DARK COLOR AND OF MUCH NATURAL ABILITY
WELLS BROWN REV
THERE HAS BEEN A SLAVE-HUNTER HERE LATELY I WAS TOLD YESTERDAY IN SEARCH OF A WOMAN

INDEED IN THE JUDGE'S CHARGE AND ALSO IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CLOSING SPEECH THE RING OF FREEDOM COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD--MUCH MORE SO THAN WAS AGREEABLE TO WHEELER AND HIS PRO-SLAVERY SYMPATHIZERS
IT WAS THOUGHT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD DESERT HIS POST IN THE MIDST OF SO EXCITING AND MOMENTOUS A TRIAL AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS PRESENCE SEEMED TO BE PARTICULARLY REQUIRED
RATHER THAN SUBMIT SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD TAKE THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN AND THEN HER OWN
GOODWIN ABIGAIL 617-622
COOPER OF THE SAME COUNTY
RICHARD WILLIAMS RICHMOND VIRGINIA
MITCHELL LEMUEL 445
SPIRITED ADDRESSES OF A MOST EMPHATIC TYPE WERE MADE BY MESSRS
MITCHELL WOULD GO OFF AND GET DRUNK AND COME HOME AND IF THE SLAVES HAD NOT AS MUCH WORK DONE AS HE HAD TASKED THEM WITH HE WOULD GO TO BEATING THEM WITH CLUBS OR ANYTHING HE COULD GET IN HIS HAND
JOHN IS NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE MULATTO SPARE MADE BUT NOT LACKING IN COURAGE MOTHER WIT OR PERSEVERANCE
HE RAN AWAY BECAUSE HE DID NOT GET PAY FOR HIS SERVICES
GEORGE WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE SMART PLEASANT COUNTENANCE AND OF DARK COMPLEXION
I THINK I SHALL REMAIN IN THIS CITY THIS WINTER
THE FOLLOWING ARE OF THE CAMBRIDGE PARTY ABOVE ALLUDED TO
W.S
HIS COMPETITOR SAW THAT NO AMOUNT OF RIVALRY COULD CRUSH A MAN THUS SELF-SUPPORTING AND GAVE UP THE EFFORT
AND YET I DON'T DO ENOUGH
THE BLOOD RUN OUT OF MY HEAD AS IF IT HAD BEEN POURED OUT OF A TUMBLER
HE HAD BEEN COMPLAINED OF FOR HAVING USED HARD LANGUAGE WHICH IS A VERY COMMON COMPLAINT INDEED AND HE SAID IN HIS FIRST NUMBER
MY DEAR WIFE I DONT WANT YOU TO GET MARRIED BEFORE YOU SEND ME SOME LETTERS BECAUSE I NEVER SHALL GET MARRIED UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN
MISS WILSON OF GEORGETOWN CROSS ROADS KENT COUNTY MD IS NOW IN THE CITY IN PURSUIT OF HER ALLEGED SLAVE MAN BUTLER
ALL THAT WAS REPORTED RESPECTING THE ARREST AND RETURN OF THE DOCTOR'S KIN SO DISGRACEFUL TO CHRISTIANITY AND CIVILIZATION IS TAKEN FROM THE LIBERATOR AS FOLLOWS
SINCE THE BOYS RAN AWAY LAST SPRING HE WAS HARDER THAN EVER
NOW MY FRIEND FULFIL THIS TO THE LETTER
AND NOW IN THESE TIMES OF GREAT TROUBLE WHICH HAVE COME UPON US WE HAVE A PECULIAR AND SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY OF TESTIFYING OUR FIDELITY AND OF ENJOYING A FULL EXPERIENCE OF ITS POWER TO SUPPORT US
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER JOHN THOMPSON WHO PASSED THROUGH YOUR HANDS I THINK IN OCTOBER 1857 AT THE SAME TIME THAT MR COOPER FROM CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA CAME ON
THREE BROTHERS AND ONE SISTER HAVE BEEN SOLD SOUTH CAN'T TELL WHERE THEY ARE SUCH WAS OSCAR'S BRIEF NARRATIVE
MRS HARPER READS THE BEST MAGAZINES AND ABLEST WEEKLIES AS WELL AS MORE ELABORATE WORKS NOT EXCEPTING SUCH AUTHORS AS DE TOCQUEVILLE MILL RUSKIN BUCKLE GUIZOT C
HE THEN SOT DOWN IN A CHEER AND LOOKED LIKE A MAN CONDEMNED TO BE HUNG
WILLIAM WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE OF USUAL SIZE OF GOOD ADDRESS AND INTELLIGENT
TOUCHING HIS SLAVE LIFE HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED PRETTY WELL EXCEPT THAT HE HAD BEEN SOLD SEVERAL TIMES INTELLECTUALLY HE WAS ABOVE THE AVERAGE RUN OF SLAVES
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD BEEN OWNED BY JOSEPH BOUKLEY HAIR INSPECTOR
IT WOULD BE VERY MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIETY IF AN EXAMPLE COULD BE MADE OF SOME OF THESE PERSISTENT AGITATORS WHO EXCITE THE IGNORANT AND RECKLESS TO TREASONABLE VIOLENCE FROM WHICH THEY THEMSELVES SHRINK BUT WHO ARE NOT ONLY IN MORALS BUT IN LAW EQUALLY GUILTY AND EQUALLY AMENABLE TO PUNISHMENT WITH THE VICTIMS OF THEIR INFLAMMATORY COUNSELS A NUMBER OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL CITIZENS REPRESENTED THE OCCURRENCE TO THE GOVERNOR AS FOLLOWS
NO RELAPSES COULD TIRE OUT HIS PATIENCE WHICH WITHOUT WEAK WASTE OF MEANS STILL APOSTOLICALLY WENT ON HOPING ALL THINGS WHILE EVEN A DYING SPARK OF GOOD FEELING REMAINED
YET HE HAD STRONG FAITH THAT THE ALMIGHTY WOULD PUNISH SLAVE-HOLDERS SEVERELY FOR THEIR WICKEDNESS
HE PREACHED HERE IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH LAST EVENING
THE LAWS AND PREACHING WERE ALIKE AS SOUNDING BRASS AND TINKLING CYMBALS TO HIM
YOU HAVE FULL AND ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES ON EVERY SIDE TO PREPARE AGAINST ANY CONTINGENCY WHY DON'T THEY DO SO
IF OTHERS HAD MANAGED TO MAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF THE PRISON-HOUSE WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTIES IT WAS FAR FROM WILLIAM TO MEET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK AS HE HAD SUFFERED EXCESSIVELY FOR FIVE WEEKS WHILE TRAVELING
KNOWING WHERE THE FUGITIVES WERE HE WAS ENABLED TO HUNT THEM IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THAT IN WHICH THEY HAD GONE AND THUS GIVE THEM TIME TO ESCAPE
FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT WE HAVE HAD NO NEW CASES
THE THEN IMPENDING JUDGMENTS SEEN BY AN EYE OF FAITH AS SET FORTH IN THIS WARNING SOON FELL WITH CRUSHING WEIGHT UPON THE OPPRESSOR AND SLAVERY DIED
NO I SAW MY BROTHER TUESDAY BUT NEVER TOLD HIM A WORD ABOUT IT WHAT PUT IT INTO YOUR HEAD TO LEAVE IT WAS BAD TREATMENT
THE REFLECTIONS CONSEQUENT UPON THE COURSE THAT HER MISTRESS HAD THUS PURSUED AWAKENED ELIZABETH TO MUCH STUDY RELATIVE TO FREEDOM AND BY THE TIME THAT SHE HAD REACHED WOMANHOOD SHE HAD VERY DECIDED CONVICTIONS TOUCHING HER DUTY WITH REGARD TO ESCAPING
YOURS W.P
THIS SIGN WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT JAMES IF NOT OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD BEFORE LONG
MAJOR RONEY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM YOU RELATIVE TO HIS BOY TUCKER WHITE AND HAS SENT ME HERE TO INQUIRE OF YOU HIS WHEREABOUTS NOW

THE LETTERS THAT WERE SENT TO ME I RECEIVED THEM ALL
HOW THEY OVERCAME THE TRIALS IN THIS SITUATION WE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO DESCRIBE
BESIDES SHE HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO SEE HER FRIENDS IN CANADA GEORGE ALSO ESCAPED FROM DUVALL
BUT UNEXPECTEDLY AS MRS CRANE WAS ON HER JOURNEY HOME FROM CAPE MAY WHERE SHE HAD BEEN FOR HER HEALTH THE SUMMER BEFORE JULIA ESCAPED SHE DIED SUDDENLY IN PHILADELPHIA
WE MIGHT SECURE TO THEM THE EXERCISE OF EVERY SACRED AFFECTION AND FACULTY WHEREWITH THE CREATOR HAS ENDOWED THEM
HIS FACE HOWEVER WAS BADLY BURNED BESIDES HIS SHOULDER BEING WOUNDED
THE EXPENSES IN SUCH CASES TO BE PROVIDED FOR BY A LEVY ON NEGROES NOW TAXED BY LAW
3 CL
RIGHT AWAY HE BEGAN STABBING ME ABOUT MY HEAD MARKS WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN AFTER A DESPERATE STRUGGLE THEOPHILUS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING OUT OF THE BUILDING
HARDCASTLE FURTHER EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT THIS MAN KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE AT THAT TIME AND INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD GO BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN MIDDLETOWN AND BE EXAMINED IN REGARD THERETO
DEAR BR
DEAR BR
DEAR BR
THE PRISON HAD VANISHED
THEN WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SLAVEHOLDERS WHEN TRAVELING HE WAS CAUTIOUS ENOUGH NOT TO EXPOSE HIMSELF BY DAY OR NIGHT WHERE HE WAS LIABLE TO DANGER
ADMONISHED THAT SHE COULD REACH THE BOAT AND ALSO TRAVEL MORE SAFELY IN MALE ATTIRE SHE AT ONCE SAID ANY WAY SO I SUCCEED IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED FOR A MOMENT THAT THE EFFORT COULD BE MADE WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING A GREAT FIGHT OF AFFLICTION WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVED FOR THE BOAT TO START MARY WAS NICELY SECRETED IN A BOX PLACE WHERE SHE WAS NOT DISCOVERED WHEN THE OFFICERS MADE THEIR USUAL SEARCH
HE BECAME A THINKER RIGHT AWAY
HE COULD NOT BRING THEM WITH HIM THEREFORE HE DID NOT TELL THEM THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE
DEAR SIR:--YOUR LETTER OF THE 19TH CAME DULY TO HAND I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD IS DOING SO WELL I KNOW THOSE THREE WELL THAT YOU SAID COME FROM ALEX I BROKE THE ICE AND IT SEEMS AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP THE TRACK OPEN BUT I HAD TO STAND AND BEG OF THOSE TWO THAT STARTED WITH ME TO COME AND EVEN GIVE ONE OF THEM MONEY AND THEN HE DID NOT WANT TO COME

JOHN GIBBONS EVIDENTLY CAME WITH OR BEFORE WILLIAM PENN TO THIS GOODLY HERITAGE OF FREEDOM HIS EARTHLY REMAINS LIE AT CONCORD FRIENDS BURYING-GROUND DELAWARE COUNTY NEAR WHERE THE FAMILY LIVED FOR A GENERATION OR TWO
IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO AS IN THE CASE OF J.B THE CARE AND ANXIETY OF OTHER SOULS BESIDES THIS CHILD CRYING FOR DELIVERANCE WEIGHED HEAVILY ON THE MIND OF MR STEVENS AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM CERTAIN REFERENCES IN HIS LETTERS
HE FLED FROM NORFOLK VIRGINIA HAVING BEEN OWNED BY THE ESTATE OF JOHN HALTERS
THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE IN HER MORE THAN IS COMMON
OF COURSE THE COMMITTEE ENJOINED UPON THEM VERY EARNESTLY NOT TO FORGET THEIR BRETHREN LEFT BEHIND GROANING IN FETTERS
IF YOU CAN I WILL PAY THE EXPENSE OF THE WHOLE
HE FLED FROM FREDERICK COUNTY MD

I HAVE MET WITH SOME OF THE KINDEST TREATMENT UP HERE THAT I HAVE EVER RECEIVED
THE ACCOMPANYING PARCEL OF EXTRACTS WILL GIVE YOU A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT SLAVE CASES TRIED IN THIS CITY UNDER THE NEW FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW UP TO THIS TIME
AT LEAST TWO OR THREE OF THESE LETTERS BEARING ON PARTICULAR PHASES OF THEIR ESCAPE ETC ARE TOO VALUABLE NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THIS CONNECTION
BESIDES SHE WAS AN OLD-LOOKING WOMAN AND MIGHT NOT NEED HIS HELP A GREAT WHILE LONGER
HORATIO GAVE HIM THE CHARACTER OF BEING A MAN OF A HIDDEN TEMPER AND AFTER THE ELECTION OF BUCHANAN HE CONSIDERED HIM A GREAT DEAL WORSE THAN EVER
DANIEL THINKS THAT SINCE CHRISTMAS THE CHANCES FOR HIS WIFE'S DELIVERANCE ARE FEWER THAN BEFORE FOR AT THAT TIME HE FEARS SHE WAS DISPOSED OF AND POSSIBLY WENT SOUTH
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY GENTLEMAN THAT IS GOING THERE OR ANY OTHER PLACE EXCEPT SOUTH THAT WANTS A SERVANT TO GO THERE WITH HIM TO WAIT ON HIM OR DO ANY OTHER WORK I HAVE A BROTHER THAT WANTS TO COME NORTH
SHE IS A WHITE WOMAN IN FACT I HAVE NOT BEEN IN ONE COLORED PERSON'S HOUSE SINCE I LEFT MASSACHUSETTS
NO WONDER FOR MY PRESENCE UNIVERSALLY ATTRACTED ATTENTION BY THE LORDS OF THE LAND
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS I WAS HIRED TO W.C
HE BELIEVED THE LORD WAS ON HIS SIDE AND CARED NOTHING FOR THE ADVERSE OPINION OF MEN
ON HIS ARRIVAL ERE HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS WITH THE BRITISH LION'S PAW WHICH HE WAS DESIROUS OF DOING OR CHANGED THE HABILIMENTS IN WHICH HE ESCAPED HAVING LISTENED TO THE RECITAL OF HIS THRILLING TALE AND WISHING TO GET IT WORD FOR WORD AS IT FLOWED NATURALLY FROM HIS BRAVE LIPS AT A LATE HOUR OF THE NIGHT A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE REMARKED TO HIM WITH PENCIL IN HAND THAT HE WANTED TO TAKE DOWN SOME ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE
IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE DIED SOON AFTER FROM THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE AND SUFFERING
THE YOUNGER MARY BY NAME NINE YEARS OF AGE ATTRACTED VERY GREAT ATTENTION BY THE DEEP INTEREST SHE MANIFESTED IN A POOR FUGITIVE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AT THE PHILADELPHIA STATION CONFINED TO THE BED AND SUFFERING EXCRUCIATING PAIN FROM WOUNDS HE HAD RECEIVED WHILST ESCAPING
NOR DID HER SYMPATHIES END IN MERE WORDS
THE VILLAIN IN WHOSE CLUTCH SHE FOUND HERSELF WAS TRYING TO DRAG HER DOWNWARD TO HIS OWN LOW LEVEL OF IMPURITY AND AT LAST SHE FELL
DAY AFTER DAY DID SHE VISIT THE PRISONERS IN THEIR CELLS TO MINISTER TO THEIR WANTS AND CHEER THEM IN THEIR SORROW
AND IF THE SAME AMOUNTS TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE SHALL NOT RECEIVE FROM THE OWNER THE ABOVE REWARD OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
NEVERTHELESS HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO DIE A SLAVE HE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE AT ALL HAZARDS
JERVIS 339
VERENEA MERCER AND OTHERS

THIS LETTER OF MINE WAS SENT OFF ABOUT THE 24TH ULT BUT I CONCLUDE WAS NOT DELIVERED TILL JUST AFTER THINE WAS WRITTEN

ANN WAS TALL AND OF A DARK CHESTNUT COLOR WITH AN INTELLIGENT COUNTENANCE AND ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE
WHAT A CRISIS IS COMING
THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS PARTY FOR STUPID OR FOR KNOW-NOTHINGS WOULD HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
DURING THE FEW MOMENTS IN WHICH THE ABOVE REMARKS WERE MADE THE SLAVEHOLDER FREQUENTLY INTERRUPTED--SAID SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL ABOUT THE LAWS MAKING HER FREE AND HER RIGHT TO LEAVE IF SHE WANTED TO
HER COMPLEXION HAS NOT CHANGED
ROSS HENRY ALIAS LEVIN STEWART 296
IN THIS STATE OF MIND THEY COMMENCED PLANNING
ALSO JOSEPH'S SISTER
LET HIM ONCE PLAN OUT HIS ROUTE AND HE MIGHT THEN TAKE TEN OR A DOZEN AT A TIME AND THEY ARE OFTEN ABLE AND WILLING TO PAY $10 A PIECE
LUCINDA BEING THE ONLY SLAVE PROPERTY HE POSSESSED AND SHE CAME TO HIM THROUGH HIS WIFE WHO WAS A METHODIST THE MASTER WAS AN OUTSIDER SO FAR AS THE CHURCH WAS CONCERNED
IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS EXACTLY WHERE THIS GUARDIAN AND MOTHER DESIRED TO BE--AS NEAR THE CHEST AS POSSIBLE
FOR A TIME THE STRUGGLE WAS OF A VERY SERIOUS CHARACTER
IF I HAD KNOWN AS MUCH BEFORE I LEFT AS I DO NOW I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT UNTIL I COULD HAVE FOUND MEANS TO HAVE BROUGHT HER WITH ME
HE SEEMED TO HAVE A HIGH APPRECIATION OF THE POTENCY OF THE PEN AND A DECIDEDLY CLEAR IDEA THAT COLORED MEN NEEDED TO LAY HOLD OF MANY ENTERPRISES WITH RESOLUTION IN ORDER TO PROVE THEMSELVES QUALIFIED TO RISE EQUALLY WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF THE HUMAN FAMILY
I ASSURE THEE FINER SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY ARE SELDOM MET WITH
FOR ONE DAY ONLY THE YOUNG MASTER KEPT HIMSELF CONCEALED THEN HE CAME FORWARD AND SAID HE DID IT IN SELF-DEFENSE AND THERE THE MATTER ENDED
THAT IT WAS ALL FALSE ABOUT THE SLAVES BEING BETTER OFF THAN THE FREE COLORED PEOPLE
THE SLAVE-HOLDERS TOLD THE BLACKS THAT RESISTANCE WOULD BE USELESS AS THEY HAD A PARTY OF THIRTY MEN IN THE WOODS NEAR BY
WILLIAM OLIVER A DARK WELL-MADE YOUNG MAN WITH THE BEST OF COUNTRY MANNERS FLED FROM MRS MARSHALL A LADY LIVING IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY MARYLAND
IT WAS HARD TO LEAVE HER BUT HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE STILL HARDER TO LIVE AND DIE UNDER THE USAGE THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED ON LYNCH'S FARM
THE HOPE OF CANADA HOWEVER TENDED TO MAKE HIM JOYFUL
HE HAS JUST ARRIVED AND THE SERVANTS ARE TAKING OFF THE BAGGAGE AT THE ASTOR HOUSE
AND TO EVERYONE WHO READS IT IT MUST COMMEND ITSELF AS ONE OF REMARKABLE INTEREST
I HAD TO WORK WITH THE HOE IN THE FIELD AND HELP DO EVERYTHING IN DOORS AND OUT IN ALL WEATHERS
ON THIS POINT SHE WROTE THUS
THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING IN GEORGETOWN HAD BEEN VOUCHSAFED HIM AND HE PREFERRED THIS LOCALITY TO HIS COUNTRY SITUATION
HE IS DESIROUS OF FINDING SOME OF HIS RELATIONS WM
PHILADELPHIA AUG
NEVERTHELESS THEY SEEMED DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA OF GOING TO A FREE COUNTRY TO ENJOY FREEDOM IF ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME
SHE CAN TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE DONE
NOT TO KNOW OF THOSE WHO WERE STRONGER THAN SHACKLES WHO WERE PIONEERS IN THE GRAND ADVANCE TOWARD FREEDOM
AND HERE IT MAY BE FURTHER ADDED THAT THE SUN WAS QUITE FAMOUS FOR THIS KIND OF U.G.R.R
HENRY WAS ARMED WITH A SIX-BARRELED REVOLVER A LARGE KNIFE AND A DETERMINED MIND
THE CHIEF DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE AT FIRST WERE THE PUBLICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN INCLUDING FOR AN INTERVAL AFTER THE RETIREMENT OF JOHN G
BUT EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD WITH PROPRIETY DO WAS DONE TO INDUCE THEM TO BREAK SILENCE UPON THE SUBJECT
DELAWARE ENSLAVED TREATED HIM LIKE A FELON
MANY A TIME I HAVE SEEN SLAVES WHIPPED ALMOST TO DEATH--WELL I TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN THEM WHIPPED TO DEATH
SHE DID NOT WISH EVEN IN APPEARANCE TO CLAIM A BELIEF IN THIS VOICE FOR HER OWN SECT ALONE
HE LEFT HIS MOTHER A FREE WOMAN AND TWO SISTERS IN CHAINS
I EXPECT THAT ABOLITIONISTS THERE ARE ALL OPPOSED TO BUYING SLAVES AND WILL NOT GIVE ANYTHING
HE SAID NO AND SHOWED HIS PASS WHICH HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED GENUINE BY THE MAGISTRATE THE SHERIFF HEREUPON TOLD THEM THAT THE COMMITMENT WAS NOT LEGAL AND WOULD NOT HOLD THEM LAWFULLY
YOU WILL DO ME THE KINDNESS OF TELLING ME IN YOUR NEXT WHETHER OR NOT THE TEN SLAVES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT FROM N.C
ABE SAID HOWEVER THAT HE WAS RICH AND STOOD PRETTY HIGH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD--STINTING FLOGGING AND DRINKING WERE NO GREAT DISADVANTAGES TO A MAN IN GEORGETOWN MARYLAND
MRS MYERS FELT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WISE TO MOVE IN THE MATTER OF THIS RESURRECTION WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE UNDERTAKER
OUR SORROW AND INDIGNATION DEEPEN DAILY AS THE THOUGHT RETURNS OF THE AWFUL ANNOUNCEMENT WITH WHICH WE WERE AWAKENED
HE COULD READ AND WRITE VERY WELL BUT HOW HE ACQUIRED THESE ARTS IS NOT KNOWN
HARDING LOUISA ALIAS REBECCA HALL 287
MY DEAR FRIEND:--IT IS WITH MUCH PLEASURE THAT I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING YOU WITH THESE FEW LINES HOPING WHEN THEY REECHES YOU THEY MAY FIND YOURSELF AND FAMILY ENJOYING GOOD HEALTH AS THEY LEAVES US AT PRESENT
HE DRANK VERY HARD HE KILLED HIMSELF DRINKING
NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT FAIL TO ASSUME AIRS OF IMPORTANCE WHICH WERE CALCULATED TO LEAD THEM TO THINK THAT HE HAD GROWN OLDER AND WISER THAN WHEN THEY KNEW HIM IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS

BUT YE CAN NOT STAY THE WHIRLWIND WHEN THE STORM BEGINS TO BREAK

THE LAW OF TREASON AS LAID DOWN BY JUDGE KANE
JIM BOW-LEGS ALIAS BILL PAUL
HE HAD HAD MORE THAN ONE OWNER IN HIS LIFE
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE PERSONS WHO RENDERED THEM ASSISTANCE IN THE SOUTH WOULD BE ENTRUSTED WITH ALL THEIR EFFECTS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SUCH VALUABLES WOULD BE FORWARDED TO A FRIEND OR TO THE COMMITTEE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY
OH WHAT A FIELD THERE IS HERE IN THIS REGION
I DECLINED TO ALLOW HIM THIS PRIVILEGE UNLESS HE HAD A WARRANT FOR THAT PURPOSE
SHE WAS APPARENTLY PROOF AGAINST ALL ADVERSARIES
A NOTICE SIGNED CLARKE WAS RECEIVED AT THE POLICE TELEGRAPH OFFICE BY THE OPERATOR DAVID WUNDERLY CONTAINING A FULL DESCRIPTION OF JIM ALSO OFFERING A REWARD OF $100 FOR HIS CAPTURE
WE PUT THEM THROUG WE HAV TO CARRY THEM 19 MILS AND CUM BACK THE SAM NIGHT WICH MAKS 38 MILS
CHARLES WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS OLD MASTER AND MISTRESS AND MADE VERY QUICK WORK OF GIVING HIS EXPERIENCE
ENOCH DAVIS CAME FROM WITHIN FIVE MILES OF BALTIMORE HAVING BEEN HELD BY ONE JAMES ARMSTRONG AN OLD GREY-HEADED MAN AND A FARMER LIVING ON HUXTOWN ROAD
NO EDUCATION FOR THE FREEMAN OF COLOR MUCH LESS FOR THE SLAVE
RICHARD WAS ENDOWED WITH A GOOD SHARE OF INTELLIGENCE
SAMUEL GREEN ALIAS WESLEY KINNARD AUGUST 28TH 1854
NOTHING EVER APPEARED MORE SAD THAN SEEING HIM IN A DYING POSTURE AND INSTEAD OF REACHING HIS MUCH COVETED DESTINATION IN CANADA GOING TO THAT BOURNE WHENCE NO TRAVELER RETURNS OF COURSE IT WAS EXPEDIENT EVEN AFTER HIS DEATH THAT ONLY A FEW FRIENDS SHOULD FOLLOW HIM TO HIS GRAVE

JASPER AND MRS BELL GOT HERE ON SATURDAY LAST AND I THINK I DROPT YOU A LINE ANNOUNCING THE FACT
HAD AGAIN BROUGHT DOWN HIS AXE WITH INCREASED POWER DEMANDING WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HIM OPEN THEY LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO RETIRE AND IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY ACTUALLY GAVE UP THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE BOAT WITHOUT FINDING A SOUL
NO MINCING THE MATTER WITH THE REBELS
AND ONCE WHEN GRACE ANNA WAS PASSING AN ELEGANT MANSION IN PHILADELPHIA A COLORED WOMAN RUSHED OUT UPON HER WITH SUCH AN IMPETUOUS DEMONSTRATION OF AFFECTION JOY AND THANKFULNESS--ALL THOUGHT OF FITNESS OF TIME AND PLACE SWEPT AWAY BY THE SWELL OF STRONG EMOTION--AS MIGHT WELL HAVE AMUSED OR SLIGHTLY ASTONISHED THE PASSERS IN THE STREET WHO KNEW NOT THAT IN HER ARMS THE WOMAN'S CHILD HAD DIED
WE REJOICE TO SAY THIS DEAR GIRL IS GOING ON VERY SATISFACTORILY
STILL I AM STANDING WITH MY RACE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW ERA AND THOUGH SOME BE FAR PAST ME IN THE LEARNING OF THE SCHOOLS YET TO-DAY WITH MY LIMITED AND FRAGMENTARY KNOWLEDGE I MAY HELP THE RACE FORWARD A LITTLE
THROUGHOUT THAT LONG PERIOD OF PERIL TO ALL WHO DARED TO REMEMBER THOSE IN BONDS AS BOUND WITH THEM HIS HOUSE WAS A WELL-KNOWN STATION ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
U.S
RESOLVED THAT WE HEARTILY TENDER HIM OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE GOOD HE HAS DONE TO OUR SUFFERING RACE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN HIS HOUSE
AFTER DECIDING TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE FOR CANADA HE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH A COLT'S REVOLVER AND RESOLVED THAT IF ANY MAN SHOULD ATTEMPT TO PUT HIS HAND ON HIM WHILE HE WAS ON THE KING'S HIGHWAY HE WOULD SHOOT HIM DOWN NOT EXCEPTING HIS OLD MASTER
HE DESIRED ME TO INFORM YOU OF HIS SAFE ARRIVAL IN THE GLORIOUS LAND OF FREEDOM AND TO SEND HIS KIND REGARDS TO YOU AND TO MR WILLIAMSON

IMMEDIATELY A REWARD OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS OFFERED FOR MY APPREHENSION BY THE STATE OF GEORGIA
HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A COMRADE WHOSE NAME INADVERTENTLY WAS NOT RECORDED
THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED THEM AND FORWARDED THEM ON WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT PRICE ELIJAH WAS CAPABLE OF REALIZING THE WORTH OF SUCH FRIENDSHIP
AND WHO COULD THEN HAVE RISEN
BUT IN A FEW DAYS BEHOLD ALONG CAME HIS MASTER
TAYLOR BENJ 320
YESTERDAY HE WENT TO SEE ABOUT GETTING HIS MONEY AND THE PERSON TO WHOM HE WENT THREATENED TO KICK HIM OFF AND ACCUSED HIM OF STEALING

I WILL GIVE $200 FOR HIS RECOVERY IF TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE OR $150 IF TAKEN IN THE STATE AND SECURED THAT I CAN GET HIM
CORDELIA WAS ABOUT FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WITH ABOUT AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF COLORED AND WHITE BLOOD IN HER VEINS
THE NEW ONE IF ANYTHING WAS WORSE THAN THE OLD ONE FOR HE COULD DO THE MOST UNBLUSHING ACTS OF CRUELTY WITH PLEASURE
BEFORE ESCAPING HE DARED NOT EVEN APPRISE HIS WIFE AND CHILD WHOM HE HAD TO LEAVE BEHIND IN THE PRISON HOUSE
BUT IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT SO FAR AS REGARDS THE ENTWINING OF THE ROOTS OF SLAVERY INTO THE SOCIAL SYSTEM IN THE OPINIONS AND INTERESTS OF MANKIND THERE WAS NO COMPARISON WHATEVER BETWEEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT CONTEST HERE AND THOSE WHICH ATTENDED IT IN AMERICA
SHE SOON ORDERED ME TO COME IN TO HER

LEWIS U.G.R.R
IN THIS EXCEPTIONAL CASE WHILE OPPOSED TO BUYING SLAVES IN COMMON WITH ABOLITIONISTS GENERALLY SHE WAS TOO TENDER-HEARTED TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION SO LONG AS THEY COULD BE BOUGHT SO CHEAP TO RID MEN OF THEIR YOKE WAS HER CHIEF DESIRE
BUT STRANGER HAD IT BEEN OTHERWISE IN YOUR INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY WHERE IT MUST BE APPARENT TO ALL WHO INQUIRE INTO IT THAT YOU HAD DONE NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS DESERVING OF HIGH COMMENDATION INSTEAD OF BLAME AND PUNISHMENT
HE WAS MOVED TO LEAVE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD GOT TIRED OF WORKING FOR THE WHITE PEOPLE FOR NOTHING FLED FROM RICHMOND VA
HE WAS NOT CERTAIN ABOUT HIS AGE RATHER THOUGHT THAT HE WAS BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS
YET EVEN AT THAT DEAD HOUR OF NIGHT FAR AWAY FROM ALL APPEARANCE OF FOES NO ONE FELT AT LIBERTY TO GIVE VENT TO HIS FEELINGS OTHER THAN IN A WHISPER

HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT TO LOOK AT SLAVERY IN ALL ITS BEARINGS AND TO SMART KEENLY UNDER EVEN ORDINARILY MILD TREATMENT
ONE OF THE WHITE MEN DEALT A HEAVY BLOW WITH HIS OAR UPON THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE BLACK MEN WHICH KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND BROKE THE OAR AT THE SAME TIME

THE UNDERTAKING WAS TOO FEARFUL TO THINK OF IN MOST CASES

AGENTS WERE SENT INTO THE COTTON STATES TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH SMALL PLANTERS WHO WERE GROWING COTTON BY THE LABOR OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES WITHOUT THE HELP OF SLAVES TO OBTAIN THEIR CROPS WHICH OTHERWISE WENT INTO THE GENERAL MARKET AND COULD NOT BE DISTINGUISHED

YET SHE CONCLUDED THAT SHE COULD HARDLY TELL WHICH STATE WAS THE WORST
THE PURITY SIMPLICITY AND HIGH-MINDED HONOR WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE YOUNGER HAD ITS EFFECT ON THE ELDER EVEN WHILE HE SMILED AT THE INFLEXIBILITY WHICH WOULD NOT SWERVE ONE HAIR'S BREADTH FROM THE LINE OF RIGHT
AND ALL OVER THE WORLD WHEREVER MAN IS FOUND THE FIRST THE MOST ARDENT LONGINGS OF THE HUMAN SOUL
HER LOT HAD BEEN THAT OF AN ORDINARY SLAVE

THOMAS HALL AND HIS WIFE WERE POUNCED UPON AT MIDNIGHT IN CHESTER COUNTY BEATEN AND DRAGGED OFF TO SLAVERY ETC
THE CITY HAS NEVER HAD WE BELIEVE A MAN DIE IN IT WORTHY OF A STATUE
IN THIS INSTANCE THE INTERFERENCE OF THE UNCLE OF HARRIET'S MASTER SAVED HER FROM THE AUCTION BLOCK
LIKEWISE THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN BY SLAVE-HOLDERS AS A GENERAL RULE SHOWED CONSIDERABLE ARTISTIC POWERS AND A MOST THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL OUTLINES OF THIS PECULIAR PROPERTY
EITHER OF THEM WOULD READILY HAVE SOLD FOR $1200
AS HARRY FROM HAVING SUFFERED MOST WAS THE HERO OF THIS PARTY AND WITHAL WAS AN INTELLIGENT MAN HE WAS FIRST CALLED UPON TO MAKE HIS STATEMENT AS TO HOW TIMES HAD BEEN WITH HIM IN THE PRISON HOUSE FROM HIS YOUTH UP
BUT POOR FELLOW HE ARE YET GROANING UNDER THE SUFFERINGS OF A HORRID SYTAM EXPECTING EVERY DAY TO RECEIVE HIS DOOM
ELLEN BEING FAIR ENOUGH TO PASS FOR WHITE OF NECESSITY WOULD HAVE TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A YOUNG PLANTER FOR THE TIME BEING
THE FEARLESS GARRETT COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE MAIL AS USUAL THE FOLLOWING INTELLIGENCE
HIS WIFE WAS VERY SEVERE
HE HELD COUNSEL WITH OTHERS IN WHOM HE COULD CONFIDE AND THEY FIXED ON A TIME TO START AND RESOLVED THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER ANYTHING ELSE BUT SLAVERY
HE STOPPED THE CAR AND ORDERED THEM OUT
QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE SAW THIS NOBLE-HEARTED FUGITIVE AND WOULD SIT LONG AND LISTEN WITH THE MOST UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO HIS NARRATIVE--NONE DOUBTING FOR A MOMENT I THINK THE ENTIRE TRUTHFULNESS OF HIS STORY
AS A SLAVE DAVID HAD BEEN REQUIRED AT ONE TIME TO WORK ON A FARM AND AT ANOTHER TIME TO DRIVE CARRIAGE OF COURSE WITHOUT PAY
THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT ALL WERE SUCCORED AND CARED FOR
I NEVER DID LIKE POOR PEOPLE
MY DEAR BROTHER GO ON IN YOUR GOOD WORK
TELL MR DOUGLASS TO REMEMBER ME AND IF HE CAN TO INTEREST HIS FRIENDS FOR ME
IT GAVE THEM THE POLICE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE TO THOSE THEY SERVED SLAVEHOLDERS THAT THEY WERE THE RIGHT MEN IN THE RIGHT PLACE GUARDING THEIR INTERESTS
IT WAS ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO BUY IN THE HOMESTEAD AT A MODERATE PRICE WITH AS MANY SLAVES AS SHE MIGHT DESIRE

WHILE THE MIND OF THE FRIEND WAS MUCH RELIEVED BY THE LETTER SHE RECEIVED SHE WAS STILL IN SOME DOUBT AS WILL BE SEEN BY THE APPENDED EXTRACT FROM A LETTER ON THE SUBJECT
FOR YEARS THE CHIEF CONCERN WITH HIM WAS AS TO HOW HE COULD SAFELY REACH A FREE STATE
HE CAME INTO POSSESSION OF THEM THROUGH HIS WIFE WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF CAROLINE'S FORMER MASTER AND ALMOST THE ONLY HEIR LEFT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TERRIBLE FEVER OF THE PREVIOUS SUMMER
HER LANGUAGE CONCERNING FREEDOM HAD IN IT THE RING OF COMMON SENSE AS HAD HER REMARKS TOUCHING HER SLAVE LIFE
JOHN SPENCER AND HIS SON WILLIAM AND JAMES ALBERT
THEY RETURNED TO MIDDLETOWN IN GREAT ANGER AND THREATENED TO PROSECUTE WILLIAM STREETS FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR
THE POOR FELLOW WITH THE SCARS UPON HIS PERSON AND THE UNMISTAKABLE EARNESTNESS OF HIS MANNER ONLY NEEDED TO BE SEEN AND HEARD TO SATISFY THE MOST INCREDULOUS OF THE TRUTH OF HIS STORY

NEVERTHELESS THEY HAD FERVENT ASPIRATIONS TO STRIKE FOR FREEDOM
PURSUING THE EVEN TENOR OF HIS WAY HE COULD AS EASILY LEAD THE FLYING FUGITIVE SLAVE BY NIGHT OUT OF THE WAY OF HIS POWERFUL MASTER AS ONE DIFFERENTLY CONSTITUTED COULD BESTOW HIS WEALTH UPON THE MOST POPULAR CHARITY IN THE LAND
SHE WAS SPEECHLESS
CALLING THE ATTENTION OF THE INQUISITION AT THE SAME TIME TO THE FACT THAT NOT UNFREQUENTLY PARDONS HAD BEEN GRANTED TO CRIMINALS UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH FOR THE MOST COLD-BLOODED MURDER TO SAY NOTHING OF OTHER GROSS CRIMES

HE WAS IN THE ATTITUDE OF A DROWNING MAN CATCHING AT A STRAW

AS THESE MEN SPOKE OF THEIR TOUGH OWNERS AND BAD TREATMENT IN SLAVERY THEY EXPRESSED THEIR INDIGNATION AT THE IDEA THAT OWINGS DADE AND DORSEY HAD DARED TO ROB THEM OF THEIR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS
I WILL STATE TO YOU WHAT CUSTOM HOUSE MASTER SAID TO ME

SHE HAD ALWAYS FOUND THOMAS SHIPLEY THE FAITHFUL PHILANTHROPIST A PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF NEED

QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE MY FATHER STARTED IN PURSUIT AND REACHED WEST CHESTER ONLY TO LEARN THAT THE CARRIAGE HAD DRIVEN THROUGH THE BOROUGH AT FULL SPEED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE
HE WROTE MANY LETTERS IN BEHALF OF OTHERS AS WELL AS FOR HIMSELF THE TONE OF WHICH WAS ALWAYS MARKED BY THE MOST ZEALOUS DEVOTION TO THE SLAVE A HIGH SENSE OF THE VALUE OF FREEDOM AND UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE THAT GOD WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE OPPRESSED AND A STRONG HOPE THAT THE DAY WAS NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN THE SLAVE POWER WOULD BE SUDDENLY BROKEN AND THAT WITHOUT REMEDY NOTWITHSTANDING THE LITERARY IMPERFECTIONS OF THESE LETTERS THEY ARE DEEMED WELL SUITED TO THESE PAGES
SO ANXIOUS WAS SHE TO HAVE HER OLDER GIRL ELEVEN YEARS OLD AT HOME WITH HER THAT SHE ALSO HIRED HER TIME BY THE YEAR FOR WHICH SHE WAS COMPELLED TO PAY TWENTY-FOUR DOLLARS
IN THOSE DARK DAYS PREVIOUS TO EMANCIPATION SUCH TESTIMONY WAS INDISPENSABLE

THE PERSON OR PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO EXECUTE THE PROCESS TO BE ISSUED BY SUCH COMMISSIONERS FOR THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF FUGITIVES FROM SERVICE OR LABOR AS AFORESAID SHALL ALSO BE ENTITLED TO A FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH FOR EACH PERSON HE OR THEY MAY ARREST AND TAKE BEFORE ANY SUCH COMMISSIONERS AS AFORESAID AT THE INSTANCE AND REQUEST OF SUCH CLAIMANT WITH SUCH OTHER FEES AS MAY BE DEEMED REASONABLE BY SUCH COMMISSIONER FOR SUCH OTHER ADDITIONAL SERVICES AS MAY BE NECESSARILY PERFORMED BY HIM OR THEM
THE DESCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS
HIS DETESTATION OF SLAVERY IN EVERY SHAPE WAS VERY DECIDED
HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT
NOT DAUNTED HOWEVER BUT AS ONE MAN THEY RESOLVED TO TAKE THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HANDS AND MAKE THE BOLD ADVENTURE
IN THIS TRYING HOUR THE SEVERED AND BLEEDING HEART OF THE HUSBAND RESOLVED TO ESCAPE AT ALL HAZARDS TAKING WITH HIM A DAGUERREOTYPE LIKENESS OF HIS WIFE WHICH HE HAPPENED TO HAVE ON HAND AND A LOCK OF HAIR FROM HER HEAD AND FROM EACH OF THE CHILDREN AS MEMENTOES OF HIS UNBOUNDED THOUGH SUNDERED AFFECTION FOR THEM
SEVEN DAYS AFTER LEAVING PHILADELPHIA HE WROTE BACK FROM CANADA AS FOLLOWS
FRANCES ELIZ ALIAS ELLEN SAUNDERS 275

STAFFORD SMITH FLED FROM WESTMORELAND COUNTY VIRGINIA WHERE HE WAS OWNED BY HARRIET PARKER A SINGLE WOMAN ADVANCED IN YEARS AND THE OWNER OF MANY SLAVES AS A MISTRESS SHE WAS VERY HARD
NO PARTICULAR CHARGES ARE FOUND RECORDED ON THE U.G.R.R
SHE NEITHER LIKES TO FEED NOR CLOTHE WELL WITH REGARD TO FLOGGING HOWEVER IN DAYS PAST SHE HAD BEEN UP TO THE MARK
THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH HIS ATTENTION WAS TURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY CANNOT BE ASCERTAINED BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A TESTIMONY AGAINST IT WAS AMONG HIS EARLIEST IMPRESSIONS AS A MEMBER OF THE RELIGIOUS SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
HER MAIDEN NAME WAS LUCRETIA COFFIN
I MUST BE EXCUSED FROM DOING THIS AS IF I COULD NOW ASCERTAIN I SHOULD NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO MENTION
ISABELLA WAS EQUALLY IGNORANT

IN SEPTEMBER 1834 MR GARRISON WAS MARRIED TO HELEN ELIZA DAUGHTER OF THE VENERABLE PHILANTHROPIST GEORGE BENSON OF PROVIDENCE R.I WHO HAD EVEN IN THE PREVIOUS CENTURY BEEN AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF A COMBINED ANTI-SLAVERY AND FREEDMEN'S AID SOCIETY IN THAT CITY

UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS SUSPECTED ARRESTED TRIED CONVICTED AND TORN FROM HIS WIFE AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN AND SENT TO THE RICHMOND PENITENTIARY FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS

SOPHIA GRAY WITH HER SON AND DAUGHTER HENRY AND MARY WAS FROM PORTSMOUTH
BUT SHOULD THEY FIND HIM THEY WILL BE OBLIGED TO TAKE LEGAL STEPS IN ARRESTING HIM BEFORE THEY CAN PROCEED
WE HAD GIVEN YOU UP
THE CONDUCTOR ORDERED THEM ON THE FRONT PLATFORM
THIS DAY 12 MONTHS I WAS NOT OUT OF THE REACH THE SLAVEHOLDERS BUT THIS 14TH DAY OF SEPT
JESSE BOND $1
HE WAS A MAN OF DARK COLOR ALTHOUGH NOT TOTALLY FREE FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF THE SUPERIOR SOUTHERN BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
HE BELONGS LIKE DOUGLASS TO THE PROSCRIBED RACE
BUT THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM IN THE CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE NOW DELIGHTED HER MIND AND THE HOPE THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD SOON FOLLOW HER TO CANADA INSPIRED HER WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT SHE WOULD ONE DAY SIT UNDER HER OWN VINE AND FIG TREE WHERE NONE DARED TO MOLEST OR MAKE HER AFRAID THE COMMITTEE RENDERED HER THE USUAL ASSISTANCE AND IN DUE TIME FORWARDED HER ON TO QUEEN VICTORIA'S FREE LAND IN CANADA
THIS NOTICE WAS TELEGRAPHED TO ALL THE WARDS IN EVERY SECTION
THE COMMITTEE FORWARDED HER ON NORTH
BIRD MARY 559
HE WAS POOR SUPPORT
A DEEP ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY AND AN EARNEST WILL TO PUT THAT FEELING INTO ACT AS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD SERVE WERE IN THE VERY LIFE-BLOOD WHICH THEY DREW FROM FATHER AND MOTHER BOTH
TAKING HER CHILD IN HER ARMS SHE SOUGHT REFUGE BEYOND THE BORDERS OF SLAVE TERRITORY
HE DONE SO MUCH I COULDN'T TELL TO SAVE MY LIFE
A NUMBER OF WHITE PERSONS WERE PRESENT AND I HAD BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK THERE BY THE MAYOR AND EDITOR OF THE PAPER
TO THIN SOIL AND AMONG THORNS FOR NO HEART SO FEEBLE OR CHOKED THAT WILL NOT FIND IN A SINGLE DAY'S GROWTH OF TRUTH GERMINATION FOR ETERNITY
I FEAR THAT HE WAS SACRIFICED
THE CAPTAIN WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED A TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH FROM NORFOLK TO THE EFFECT THAT HIS BOAT WAS SUSPECTED OF HAVING SLAVES SECRETED THEREON
OF THIS THERE WAS SO MUCH DANGER WITH A RICHMOND COURT THAT HENRY FEARED THAT THE CHANCES WERE AGAINST HIM
NOR WAS HE LIKELY TO BE CALLED HANDSOME
GIVE MINE TO YOUR FAMILY
I WISH MY EXECUTORS OR TRUSTEES TO CARRY OUT MY VIEWS IN REGARD TO THE EDUCATION OF COLORED CHILDREN IN CANADA BY PAYING OVER THE INTEREST ARISING ANNUALLY FROM THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MENTIONED IN THE SECOND ITEM TO SUCH SCHOOL OR SCHOOLS AS IN THEIR JUDGMENT THEY MAY DEEM BEST
SHE HAD EATEN THE WHITE BREAD OF SLAVERY UNDER THE MISSES CHAPMAN AND THEY HAD BEEN SINGULARLY KIND TO HER TAKING SPECIAL PAINS WITH HER IN REGARD TO THE COMPANY SHE SHOULD KEEP A POINT IMPORTANT TO YOUNG GIRLS SO LIABLE TO EXPOSURE AS WERE THE UNPROTECTED YOUNG FEMALES OF THE SOUTH
THE FOLLOWING ENACTMENT IS GIVEN AS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF VIRGINIA IN 1856
JAMES IS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE WELL MADE QUITE BLACK AND PRETTY SHREWD
HE SAVED UP HIS MONEY AND TOOK CARE OF HIMSELF CREDITABLY
HIS COMRADE GEORGE WAS LIKEWISE OF THE SAME METTLE AND WAS AIDED IN THE SAME WAY
WHITE ILLUSTRATION
PERRY HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO LET A LOAD OF FODDER UPSET ABOUT WHICH HIS MASTER BECAME EXASPERATED AND IN HIS AGITATED STATE OF MIND HE SUCCEEDED IN AFFIXING A NUMBER OF VERY UGLY STATIONARY MARKS ON PERRY'S BACK
THUS THEY WERE SOLD AND RESOLD AS A MATTER OF SPECULATION AND HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE PARTED AFTER THE FUGITIVES HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR BY THE COMMITTEE THEY WERE FORWARDED ON NORTH
HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD
TAKING THEIR ADVICE HE COMMENCED SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES COMPARED WITH WHICH THE DIET LABOR AND COMFORTS OF AN ORDINARY PENITENTIARY WOULD HAVE BEEN LUXURIOUS
FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH SECRETED
HE WAS ONCE A SLAVE-HOLDER BUT HAS TWICE BEEN A DELEGATE TO OUR FREE-SOIL NATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND IS A STRONG FRIEND OF FREEDOM
MANY SLAVES IN CITIES COULD RAISE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A PASSAGE PROVIDING THEY COULD FIND ONE WHO WAS WILLING TO RISK AIDING THEM
HE WAS A CHURCHMAN SAID HANDY BUT HE NEVER ALLOWED ME TO GO TO CHURCH A HALF DOZEN TIMES IN MY LIFE ROBERT BELONGED TO MRS MARY HICKMAN AT LEAST SHE HAD HIM IN HER POSSESSION AND REAPED THE BENEFIT OF HIS HIRE AND ENJOYED THE LEISURE AND EASE THEREOF WHILE HE TOILED
CANADA IS HIGHLY PRAISED_--_THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IS IMPLORED TO SEND ALL THE FUGITIVES THERE_--"_FARMERS AND MECHANICS WANTED_"--"_NO LIVING IN CANADA FOR NEGROES AS ARGUED BY MASTERS FLATLY DENIED C C C SO I ASK YOU TO SEND THE FUGITIVES TO CANADA
NOT A GREAT WHILE HOWEVER DID SHE REMAIN THERE IN A STATE OF FREEDOM BEFORE THE SLAVE-HUNTERS PURSUED HER AND ONE NIGHT THEY POUNCED UPON THE WHOLE FAMILY AND WITHOUT JUDGE OR JURY HURRIED THEM ALL BACK TO SLAVERY
THE WHITE CITIZENS FEARING THE DANGER OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE TO THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW BEGAN TO TALK OF THE INSECURITY OF THESE EXILES
VERY BAD ON COLORED PEOPLE
17TH 1856
INFORM HER THAT I NOW STOP IN ST CATHARINES NEAR THE NIAGARA FALLS THAT I AM NOT YET IN BUSINESS BUT EXPECT TO GET INTO BUSINESS VERY SOON--THAT I AM IN THE ENJOYMENT OF GOOD HEALTH AND HOPING THAT THIS COMMUNICATION MAY FIND MY AFFECTIONATE WIFE THE SAME
HE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF A PLACE WHERE THE UNDERGROWTH AND BUSHES WERE ALMOST IMPENETRABLE
THEY SAID THEY WOULD DIE BEFORE THEY WOULD DO SO
THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM HIM AFFORDED GRATIFYING EVIDENCE THAT HE NEITHER FORGOT HIS GOD NOR HIS FRIENDS IN FREEDOM
HE WAS OWNED BY MRS ANN COLLEY A WIDOW RESIDING NEAR PETERSBURG VA
THE END OF THE REBELLION
FARE THROUGH $12,30 TO HERE
HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIS FAMILY IF HE SHOULD SEE FIT TO MARRY
AND I WOULD PREFER TO-DAY TO BE PENNILESS IN THE STREETS RATHER THAN TO HAVE WITHHELD A SINGLE HOUR'S LABOR OR A DOLLAR FROM THE SACRED CAUSE OF LIBERTY JUSTICE AND HUMANITY
HAD HIS MASTER'S DESIGN TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE BEEN EVER SO GREAT HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT A LABOR BEYOND HIS POWER
AT THE END OF THIS TIME HIS REPOSE WAS AGAIN SORELY DISTURBED BY REPORTS FROM WITHOUT THAT SUSPICION HAD BEEN AWAKENED TOWARDS THE WASH-HOUSE
I WISH YOU WOULD WRITE TO ME HOW MANY OF MY FRIENDS YOU HAVE SEEN SINCE OCTOBER 1857
HE SUFFERED GREATLY UNDER THE SAID BARNES AND FINALLY HIS EYES WERE OPEN TO SEE THAT THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL SUCH SLAVERY-SICK SOULS AS HIMSELF
HE SAID ONE OF THE WITNESSES HAD BETRAYED HIM IN COURT YESTERDAY AND THEY ATTACKED HIM LAST NIGHT
THE MISTRESS PROFESSED TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SIMPLY SAID SHE WENT TO SLEEP AND FELL OUT HERSELF AS USUAL NOTHING WAS DONE IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT THESE WERE SPECIMENS OF THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION
THE IMPRESSIONS MADE BY DR H ON WILLIAM PENN'S MIND AT HIS FIRST INTERVIEW WILL DOUBTLESS BE INTERESTING TO ALL CONCERNED AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE FOLLOWING LETTER
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION SHE STARTED OFF IN THE FLOW OF HER DISCOURSE WHICH ROLLED SMOOTHLY AND UNINTERRUPTEDLY ON FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS
IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND REFERRING TO THIS OUTRAGE MRS HARPER THUS WROTE
WRITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR I WISH VERY MUCH TO HEAR FROM YOU
HE HAS LEFT AMONGST HIS BOOKS AND PAPERS EIGHT MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES EACH FILLED WITH SELECTIONS COPIED IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING AND CULLED FROM THE WRITINGS OF MANY OF THE MOST GIFTED AUTHORS BOTH IN POETRY AND PROSE
SAY TO HER AT NAT AMBEY THAT I WISH TO KNOW FROM HER THE LAST LETAR THAT JOSEPH AMBIE AND HENRY AMBIE TWO BROTHERS AND ANN WARFIELD A COUISIN OF THEM TWO BOYS I STATE ABOVE
CONSEQUENTLY HE PREFERRED THE BOX TO THE AUCTION-BLOCK
WILSON WM 379
STOP POOR SINNER STOP AND THINK BEFORE YOU FURTHER GO
THEY MADE NO OPEN ASSAULT IN THE STREET
THERE WERE SEVERAL MEN IN THE HOUSE ALL ARMED WITH DEADLY WEAPONS AWAITING THE APPROACH OF THE INTRUDERS
A NUMBER WERE THUS AIDED BY BURRIS
I WILL GIVE THE ABOVE REWARD FOR THEM OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EITHER OF THEM IF TAKEN AND LODGED IN ANY JAIL IN MARYLAND SO THAT I GET THEM AGAIN
WILLIAM CRAFT WENT AFTER A TIME TO LEWIS HAYDEN
TO SERVE THIS DEAR CAUSE OF PEACE AND LIBERTY AND LOVE WE HAVE NO NEED TO GRASP THE SWORD OR ANY INSTRUMENT OF VIOLENCE AND DEATH
ON THIS PRINCIPLE AND SUGGESTION DAVE HAD BEEN DIGGING FAITHFULLY AND HARD AND WITH THE AID OF FRIENDS HE HAD NEARLY SUCCEEDED
ONE CASE OF WHICH THE SISTERS FOR A TIME HAD CHARGE SEEMS WORTHY OF A SOMEWHAT MORE EXTENDED MENTION
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIJAH'S RELATIVES IF ANY SHOULD HAVE OCCASION TO LOOK FOR PARTICULARS CONCERNING THIS LOST INDIVIDUAL WE ADD THAT HE WAS A SPARE-BUILT MAN OF A DARK COLOR
SEVERAL YEARS PREVIOUS HE HAD MADE AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE BUT FAILED
AND UNTO HER LIPS SO DUSKY PRESS THE CUP OF WOE AND SHAME
UNDER THIS GAMBLER ELIJAH HAD BEEN WRONGED UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS WHEN HE RESOLVED TO ESCAPE
THE WAY TO BOSTON WAS ENTIRELY CLOSED
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE YOU NOW TO CONSIDER THE DECEPTION THAT WE PRACTISE ON OURSELVES THE DANGEROUS ERROR INTO WHICH WE FALL WHEN WE PASS OFF THE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR DUTY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF IT
THEREFORE AS HE HAD NO STRONG TIES TO BREAK HE COULD LOOK TO THE TIME OF LEAVING THE LAND OF BONDAGE WITHOUT REGRET
IN THE YEAR 1840 HE GAVE REGULAR INSTRUCTION TO A CLASS OF LADIES AND IT WAS THROUGH ONE OF THESE PUPILS THAT THE FIRST FEMALE GRADUATE IN AMERICA WAS INTERESTED IN THE STUDY OF MEDICINE
HIS CAUTION SOUND JUDGMENT AND MENTAL BALANCE WERE QUALITIES HARDLY LESS NEEDED OR LESS IMPORTANT
HOWEVER HE WAS NOT LONG IN DECIDING THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD BE OF NO ADVANTAGE TO HIM
CUSTUS WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE BOX CONTAINED BUT SUSPECTING FROM THE APPARENT ANXIETY AND INSTRUCTIONS OF THE YOUNG MAN WHO ENGAGED HIM TO GO AFTER IT THAT IT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WHILE THE FREIGHT CAR STILL REMAINED ON THE STREET DEMANDED IT OF THE FREIGHT AGENT NOT WILLING TO WAIT THE USUAL TIME FOR THE DELIVERY OF FREIGHT

HIS LAST WIFE WAS RIGHT PLEASANT--HE WAS A FARMER AND WAS RICH HAD SOLD SLAVES AND WAS SEVERE WHEN HE FLOGGED TALBOT HAD BEEN PROMISED A TERRIBLE BEATING ON THE RETURN OF HIS MASTER FROM THE SPRINGS WHITHER HE HAD GONE TO RECRUIT HIS HEALTH AS HE WAS POORLY THIS WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF TALBOT'S FLIGHT
WHILE TARRYING A DAY OR TWO IN SALEM SAM'S LETTER WAS RECEIVED IN PHILADELPHIA
IT IS SATURDAY EVENING AND I AM PREPARING TO PREACH TO-MORROW AFTERNOON FROM HEB
IN ENGLAND HE WAS GREETED WITH CORDIAL APPRECIATION AND HOSPITALITY BY ALL CLASSES
SHE WORKED OFF AND ON DAYS WORK TO WASH DISHES
THEY PERCEIVED THAT HE SPOKE IN A FRIENDLY WAY AND THEY AT ONCE ASKED DIRECTIONS WITH REGARD TO PHILADELPHIA
BUT THEY NEITHER CAME IN STATE-ROOM NOR AS CABIN STEERAGE OR DECK PASSENGERS
BY THE REMOVAL OF HIS OLD MASTER BY DEATH A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE FOLLOWED
SHE WAS NEATLY ATTIRED IN MALE HABILIMENTS AND IN THAT MANNER CAME ALL THE WAY FROM WASHINGTON
NOT THAT WE HAVE NOT A RIGHT TO BREATHE THE AIR AS FREELY AS ANYBODY ELSE HERE IN BALTIMORE BUT WE ARE TREATED WORSE THAN ALIENS AMONG A PEOPLE WHOSE LANGUAGE WE SPEAK WHOSE RELIGION WE PROFESS AND WHOSE BLOOD FLOWS AND MINGLES IN OUR VEINS
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN DISTRESS AND OUT OF DOORS YOU TOOK ME IN
IN WAVERTON'S HOUSEHOLD ELIZA HAD BECOME A FIXTURE AS IT WERE ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO HIS CHILDREN
SAMUEL HARRINGTON OF CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT MARYLAND WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN FOR WHOSE BENEFIT ANN LABORED DURING HER YOUNGER DAYS
SHE FRANKLY ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT PRIOR TO THE DEATH OF HER OLD MASTER SHE WAS FAVORABLY TREATED COMPARED WITH MANY OTHERS
OR WHICH HE EITHER PROMPTED OR MADE EFFECTIVE BY HIS COUNTENANCE OR SANCTION,--COMMENDING COUNSELLING AND INSTIGATING FORCIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE LAW
SHE AGREED TO TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS
YET I AM WELL AWARE OF THE RISK OF WRITING AND HAVE RESTRAINED HIM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND THE LAST ONE I WROTE WAS TO BE THE LAST TILL AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO RECLAIM HIS WIFE
BAYARD COMMENCED A SUIT AGAINST MR GARRETT CLAIMING ALL THE FUGITIVES AS SLAVES
HOW CAME THERE WAS NO MORE WORK DONE THAT DAY SAID MASTER TO ME
HIS GRANDMOTHER ONE SISTER WITH TWO CHILDREN AND A COUSIN WITH FIVE CHILDREN ALL ATTACHED BY THE SHERIFF FOR SALE WERE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF HIS MISTRESS
I SAID HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO START WITH AND WE WILL SEND YOU MORE IF YOU NEED IT
TWO HUNDRED LASHES WERE MERELY A PROMISE FOR HIM
HIS DUTIES HAD BEEN TO ATTEND UPON HIS MASTER AND REPUTED FATHER ELIAS HEINES ESQ A LAWYER BY PROFESSION IN NORTH CAROLINA
WILLIAM DAVIS
WILLIAM DAVIS
TWO YEARS PREVIOUS TO HIS COMING INTO THE HANDS OF GAY HE AND HIS WIFE WERE BOTH SOLD
TO KEEP UP THE UTMOST PHYSICAL ENDURANCE WAS TAXED

PARTY NO
MUCH AS I LOVED ANTI-SLAVERY MEETINGS I DID NOT FEEL THAT I COULD AFFORD TO ATTEND THEM AS MY IMMEDIATE DUTY WAS TO THE FLYING FUGITIVE
WE REJOICE TO SEE THAT THIS NEW COMPANY IS BEING SUPPORTED NOT ONLY BY BENEVOLENT PHILANTHROPISTS AND CAPITALISTS IN LONDON BUT BY EXPERIENCED MANCHESTER MANUFACTURERS
ONE OF THEM MADE A CONFIDANT OF HIM AND HE AGREED TO PILOT THEM ON THEIR WAY AND HAD SEVERAL WHITE MEN SECRETED TO TAKE THEM AS SOON AS THEY GOT IN HIS HOUSE
OF COURSE HE LEFT BEHIND HIS WIFE AND CHILD
PLEASE GIVE DIRECTIONS FOR FORWARDING TO ELMIRA AND NAME THE PRICE OF TICKETS

JOHN JOHNSON AND LAWRENCE THORNTON
AND UNABLE TO WALK AND SHE WAS PENNILESS AND UNABLE TO HIRE A CONVEYANCE EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN ANY ONE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO RISK THE LAW IN TAKING THEM A NIGHT'S JOURNEY
AMONG THESE COMPLAINTS WAS THE CHARGE OF ILL-TREATMENT
WHAT WAS YOUR MASTER'S NAME INQUIRED A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THOMAS MAY HAVE BEEN TROUBLING HIS BRAIN TO KNOW WHY HIS MAN JOHN TREATED HIM SO SHABBILY AS TO LEAVE HIM IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING IN HANDING WILLIAM DOWN TO POSTERITY THE DESCRIPTION OF TYLER HAS BEEN ADOPTED INSTEAD OF THE ONE ENGROSSED IN THE RECORDS BY THE COMMITTEE
HENRY GARRETT:--DEAR SIR:--I HAVE JUST HEARD THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF MY FRIEND MRS GRAVES OF THE DEATH OF YOUR DEAR FATHER
FROM VIRGINIA MARYLAND DELAWARE NORTH CAROLINA WASHINGTON D.C AND SOUTH CAROLINA
ABRAM AND RICHARD MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH HIM TO BRING THEM AWAY
IF THE LADIES HERE SHOULD MAKE UP FINE SHIRTS FOR MEN OR CHILDREN'S CLOTHES OF VARIOUS KINDS WOULD THEY BE OF USE AT PHILADELPHIA OR NEW YORK TO FUGITIVES
THE WEEKLY PARTINGS WERE A NEVER-FAILING SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS
FROM MY LONG RESIDENCE UNDER THE SAME ROOF I LEARNED TO KNOW WELL HER UNCOMMON SELF-SACRIFICE OF CHARACTER AND TO BE WILLING AND GLAD WHENEVER IN MY POWER TO HONOR HER MEMORY
THAT YOUNG MAN AS YOU CALL HIM IS A YOUNG WOMAN AND HAS COME DRESSED IN THIS MANNER ALL THE WAY FROM WASHINGTON CITY
SEE FOSTER HALE AND HAWKINS AND THE OPINIONS OF IREDELL PATTERSON CHASE MARSHALL AND WASHINGTON J.J OF THE SUPREME COURT AND OF PETERS D.J IN U.S
I AM PRECISELY OF YOUR OPINION ABOUT HIM THAT HE IS A QUEER STICK AND WHILE I ADVISED HIM CAREFULLY IN REFERENCE TO HIS OWN UNDERTAKINGS I TOOK NO COUNSEL OF HIM CONCERNING MINE
MRS HARPER TOOK THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE WAR AND LOOKED WITH EXTREME ANXIETY FOR THE RESULTS
THAT HIS MOTHER HAD LONG LIVED IN THE FAMILY OF THE DOCTOR THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO SELL HER AND HER CHILDREN AND HE WARNED THE PEOPLE NOT TO BID FOR HIM FOR HE WOULD NO LONGER BE A SLAVE TO ANY MAN AND IF ANY ONE BOUGHT HIM HE WOULD LOSE HIS MONEY
IT WAS IN THE LATTER RESPECT THAT OF MORAL CO-OPERATION THAT DR FURNESS'S SERVICES WERE MOST VALUABLE
HE DESCRIBED HIS MASTER WASHINGTON BONAFONT AS A SORT OF A ROWDY WHO DRANK PRETTY HARD LEAVING A VERY UNFAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON HENRY'S MIND AS HE FELT ALMOST SURE SUCH CONDUCT WOULD LEAD TO A SALE AT NO DISTANT DAY
WE ARE FEELING HOPEFUL DEAR FRIENDS ABOUT THY CRUSHED AND PERSECUTED PEOPLE FOR SURELY GOD IS WORKING FOR THEM BY WAYS AND MEANS THAT WE KNOW NOT
IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THIS IS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY OCCURRENCE

HER HUSBAND HAD FORMERLY BEEN OWNED BY JOHN S
BRANTFORD APRIL 20TH
HOW LONG ERE THOU WILT ARISE TO AVENGE THE WRONGS OF THE POOR SLAVE
THE COMMITTEE FULLY INTERVIEWED HIM AND PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD REALLY WORN THE FETTERS OF SLAVERY AND THAT HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN BREAKING HIS BONDS AND FLEEING FOR REFUGE TO CANADA AND WAS ENTITLED TO AID AND SYMPATHY
RICHARDS ALTHOUGH HE WAS QUITE AS MUCH A WHITE MAN AS HE WAS BLACK
I MUST NOW INFORM YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CANADA AT LEAST AS MUCH OF IT AS I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD
SHE IS A WOMAN OF HIGH MORAL TONE WITH SUPERIOR NATIVE POWERS HIGHLY CULTIVATED AND A CAPTIVATING ELOQUENCE THAT HOLD HER AUDIENCE IN RAPT ATTENTION FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE CLOSE
HIS SCHOOLING HAD BEEN SUCH AS COULD ONLY BE GATHERED ON PLANTATIONS UNDER BRUTAL OVERSEERS;--OR WHILE FLEEING,--OR IN SWAMPS,--IN PRISONS,--OR ON THE AUCTION-BLOCK ETC

EDWARD JOHN AND CHARLES HALL
IF HE WHOSE PURE EYES CANNOT LOOK UPON SIN WITH ALLOWANCE CAN PERMIT THE DAY OF FREEDOM TO BE DEFERRED I CERTAINLY CAN WORK AND WAIT
SHE HAS CHEERED THE PRISONER IN HIS CELL AND STRENGTHENED THE MARTYR AT THE STAKE
HE LEFT THE NEXT DAY BEING THE SABBATH AND HAS NEVER RETURNED SINCE ALTHOUGH HE HAS LIVED IN THE CITY OF BOSTON EVER SINCE EXCEPT ABOUT SIX MONTHS IN CANADA
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE TOOK THE SUN FOR NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE SUN BUT FOR THIS SPECIAL LITERATURE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE SUN A CHEAP AND RELIABLE PAPER
ON FINDING THAT THIS WAS REALLY A FACT HENRY WAS OFFERED AND ACCEPTED PRIVATE QUARTERS WITH THE WELL-KNOWN PHILANTHROPIST AND FRIEND OF THE FUGITIVE FRANCIS JACKSON

SMITH WHO BOXED UP HENRY BOX BROWN IN RICHMOND VA AND FORWARDED HIM BY OVERLAND EXPRESS TO PHILADELPHIA AND WHO WAS ARRESTED AND CONVICTED EIGHT YEARS AGO FOR BOXING UP TWO OTHER SLAVES ALSO DIRECTED TO PHILADELPHIA HAVING SERVED OUT HIS IMPRISONMENT IN THE PENITENTIARY WAS RELEASED ON THE 18TH ULTIMO AND ARRIVED IN THIS CITY ON THE 21ST
BUT WHAT COULD HE DO
ONE OF THE OVERSEERS BY THE NAME OF BILL ANDERSON ONCE SHOT A YOUNG SLAVE MAN CALLED LUKE AND WOUNDED HIM SO SERIOUSLY THAT HE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE AT ANOTHER TIME ONE OF THE OVERSEERS BEAT AND KICKED A SLAVE TO DEATH THIS BARBARITY CAUSED THE MISTRESS TO BE VERY MUCH STIRRED UP AND SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY MORE WHITE OVERSEERS
AND THEY GROWN TO WOMANHOOD HAD GLIDED INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS VERY CONSIDERABLE BUSINESS
WHAT DO ABOLITIONISTS THINK OF IT
JEREMIAH AND WIFE JULIA 141
THEIR PERSONS AND OLD WORN-OUT CLOTHING BEING FULL OF IT
THE OVERSEERS WERE POOR WHITE TRASH
BUT THE CHANGE PROVED NO ADVANTAGE TO THEM AS THEY FOUND SLAVERY NO BETTER UNDER THEIR MISTRESS THE WIDOW THAN UNDER THEIR MASTER

AS GREEN AS HE SEEMED HE HAD SUCCEEDED ADMIRABLY IN HIS UNDERTAKING
WHEN HE GOT TO MEDIA HE PLACED THEM IN CARE OF A COLORED MAN WHO PROMISED TO HAND THEM OVER TO THEE ON 2D DAY LAST
WHILST THE FIERYS WERE WORKING LIKE BEAVERS TO RE-ENSLAVE THESE BRAVE FUGITIVES THE LATTER WERE DAILY DRINKING IN MORE AND MORE OF THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM AND WERE BUSY WITH SCHEMES FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF OTHER NEAR KIN LEFT BEHIND UNDER THE GALLING YOKE
HIS FATHER WAS WHITE AND HIS MOTHER NEARLY SO
THE MEN TOLD HIM TO STAND HIS GROUND AND THEY WOULD STAND BY HIM AND DEFEND HIM THEY HAD LIVED TOGETHER AND WOULD DIE TOGETHER
NOR WAS SHE AWARE THAT HE HAD EVER TREATED ANY OF HIS SERVANTS CRUELLY
NANCY'S SORROWS FIRST COMMENCED IN ALABAMA

BERRY NO

HE HATED EVERYTHING LIKE SLAVERY AND AS YOUNG AS HE WAS HE HAD ALREADY MADE FIVE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE
THE LANDLADY BEING ENGAGED IN GETTING SUPPER SET HIM TO WATCH THE CAKES THAT WERE BAKING
HE HOWEVER WAS SAID TO BE OF THE MODERATE CLASS OF SLAVE-HOLDERS
BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH AT HIS DEATH NO WILL COULD BE FOUND
MRS LUCRETIA MOTT MRS MCKIM MISS SARAH PUGH AND MRS PLUMLY VOLUNTEERED TO ACCOMPANY THIS POOR SLAVE MOTHER TO THE COURT-HOUSE AND TO OCCUPY SEATS BY HER SIDE WHILE SHE SHOULD FACE HER MASTER AND BOLDLY ON OATH CONTRADICT ALL HIS HARD SWEARING
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK I AM GOING TO LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND AGAIN
ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE FIELD AND WAS SET TO SPINNING AND WEAVING
THE TRAIN ONLY WAS FROM HARRISBURG TO READING AND AS IT HAPPENED THE GOODS HAD TO STAY ALL NIGHT WITH US AND AS SOME EXCITEMENT EXISTS HERE ABOUT GOODS OF THE KIND WE THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT AND WISE TO DETAIN THEM UNTIL WE COULD HEAR FROM YOU

HILL HEZEKIAH 200
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT SOON AFTER PEARSON CAME OUT FROM THE BACK ROOM WHERE HE AND KNIGHT AND THE SHERIFF HAD BEEN CLOSETED THE SHERIFF SAID THAT KNIGHT WAS BAILED--HE WOULD NOT SAY BY WHOM
NO ATTEMPT CAN HERE BE MADE TO RECITE THE PARTICULARS OF THE TRIAL OTHER THAN BY A MERE REFERENCE
AND YET HOW HARD ONE WOULD THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO MAKE THIS SACRIFICE
LEWIS--E.L
WE TOLD THEM THAT WE HADN'T ANY THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO CARRY THEM WHERE WE CAME FROM
A GREAT CLOUD WAS ROLLED FROM THEIR EYES
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT WERE SLAVES IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA
THEY WOULD TELL US THAT WE MUST TAKE MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKETS TO SEND IT TO AFRICA TO ENLIGHTEN THE AFRICAN RACE
WM ALIAS WM
ELLEN CRAFT HERE THEY AGAIN THOUGHT MUCH OVER MATTERS AND WISELY CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD BETTER ASSUME THE ATTITUDE OF A GENTLEMAN VERY MUCH INDISPOSED
NOBODY FORCED ME AWAY
IF IT BE SO ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I HOPE THEY WILL FEEL IN ADDITION TO ALL THEY HAVE FELT HERETOFORE AS TO THE CHARACTER OF THEIR MOTHER THAT WE WHO ARE HERE CAN APPRECIATE HER SERVICES AND THE SERVICES OF ALL WHO WERE UNITED WITH HER AS CO-OPERATORS IN THIS GREAT AND WORTHY CAUSE
THEY PROVED TO BE QUITE INTELLIGENT CONSIDERING HOW YOUNG THEY WERE AND HOW THE HARROW OF SLAVERY HAD BEEN UPON THEM FROM INFANCY
JOHN KNIGHT
THE GOOD SPIRIT OF FREEDOM MADE THE WAY PLAIN TO HER BY WHICH AN ESCAPE COULD BE EFFECTED
AGAINST MRS PATTISON HIS COMPLAINT WAS THAT SHE WAS MEAN SNEAKING AND DID NOT WANT TO GIVE HALF ENOUGH TO EAT FOR THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF ALL CHRISTENDOM AND COMING POSTERITY ESPECIALLY THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT AND LETTER ARE RECORDED WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL VALUE
RALPH WAS TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE FIVE FEET TEN INCHES HIGH DARK WELL MADE INTELLIGENT AND A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH
AT THE TIME OF THE DOCTOR'S ESCAPE IN 1855 HE WAS THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE A MAN OF MEDIUM SIZE AND ABOUT AS PURELY COLORED AS COULD READILY BE FOUND WITH A FULL SHARE OF SELF-ESTEEM AND PLUCK
I HAVE NOT THE ADVERTISEMENT AND CAN'T TELL HOW SHE WAS DESCRIBED
JOHN PHILLIPS HIS SO-CALLED MASTER BELIEVED IN SELLING AND PRACTICED ACCORDINGLV TO THE EXTENT AT LEAST OF SELLING ADAM'S MOTHER BROTHER AND SISTER ONLY TWO YEARS BEFORE HIS ESCAPE
AS ROBERT HAD POSSESSED BUT RARE PRIVILEGES TO VISIT HIS WIFE HE FELT IT LESS A TRIAL TO LEAVE THAN IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE
SO THE VERY DAY JULIA AND HER HUSBAND ESCAPED ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE TO PUT HER UP AT AUCTION A THIRD TIME
THE INTENT OF THE PRISON ASSOCIATION IS THREEFOLD

STEWART MR CONCKLIN DID NOT ABANDON THEM BUT RISKED HIS OWN LIBERTY TO SAVE THEM
ACCORDINGLY SAID MR THOMPSON I GUESS WE HAD BETTER CLOSE ADDING IF HE COULD ONLY WRITE HE COULD GIVE SEVEN VOLUMES ALSO SAID HE GIVE MY BEST RESPECTS TO MR W.W
SO WHEN I STARTED I RESOLVED TO DIE SOONER THAN I WOULD BE TAKEN BACK
HE THOUGHT HIS MISTRESS QUITE AS GOOD IF NOT A LITTLE BETTER THAN MOST SLAVE-HOLDERS
A WOMAN MAY BE 40 YEARS OLD WITH 3 CHILDREN SAY 4 6 AND 8[A 15.00 3
SATURDAY WAS SELECTED AS A DAY UPON WHICH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND WEALTHY CLASSES ATTEND THE CRYSTAL PALACE AND THE COMPANY WAS ON THIS OCCASION THE MOST DISTINGUISHED THAT HAD BEEN GATHERED TOGETHER WITHIN ITS WALLS SINCE ITS OPENING DAY

THE CHIEF INSPECTOR SHALL RECEIVE AS HIS COMPENSATION TEN PER CENT ON ALL THE FEES AND FINES RECEIVED BY THE INSPECTORS ACTING UNDER HIS AUTHORITY AND MAY BE REMOVED AT THE PLEASURE OF THE EXECUTIVE
THESE ERRORS ARE NOTICED AND CORRECTED BECAUSE IT IS BARELY POSSIBLE THAT BILL AND HANSON MAY STILL BE LOST TO THEIR RELATIVES WHO MAY BE INQUIRING AND HUNTING IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR THEM AND AS MANY OTHERS MAY TURN TO THESE RECORDS WITH HOPE IT IS THEREFORE DOUBLY IMPORTANT THAT THESE DESCRIPTIONS SHALL BE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CORRECT ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS AGES
HE CONDEMNED IN VERY STRONG TERMS A MAN BY THE NAME OF BENJAMIN B
AND ALL THINGS CONSIDERED NO ONE WAS SO WELL QUALIFIED AS MR STILL TO REPRODUCE THAT PHASE OF IT WITH WHICH HE WAS SO INTIMATELY CONCERNED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ACTING COMMITTEE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA
WHO HAS NOT CAUGHT THE LIVELY EXPRESSION OF DELIGHT WHICH BEAMED FROM HIS COUNTENANCE WHEN A FACT WAS DISCLOSED WHICH HAD A FAVORABLE BEARING ON THE LIBERTY OF THE CAPTIVE
ACCORDINGLY ON THE DAY OF SALE BOLDIN WAS ON HAND AND THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER FOR JOHN

IN ADDITION TO THE INFLUENCE WHICH SUCH REBELLIOUS BLOOD EXERTED OVER HIM TOGETHER WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE HE WAS ALSO UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND ADVICE OF A DAUGHTER OF OLD IRELAND
I KNEW HER BY HER GENERAL FAVOR AND HAVE NO PARTICULAR MARK

SAM ANOTHER LIKELY-LOOKING MEMBER OF THIS PARTY WAS TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE AND A VERY PROMISING-LOOKING YOUNG FUGITIVE HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE EDUCATION WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
TWO FEMALE PASSENGERS FEOM MARYLAND
BUT THE MASTER MOVED QUICKLY AND SOLD ISAAC TO DR JAMES A NEGRO TRADER
WELL DID YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE THIS DAY
AFTER REFLECTION INSTEAD OF MAKING A REDUCTION SHE RAISED THE AMOUNT TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH OSCAR CONCLUDED WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIMSELF
SHE SAID THAT SHE LEFT NOT ON ACCOUNT OF BAD TREATMENT BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE WANTED HER FREEDOM
HE BOUGHT ME BEFORE I WAS QUITE FOUR YEARS OLD FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
STATER SAM'L 223
AND ON THINE EAR THE MURMURS BLEST OF SHILOAH'S WATERS SOFTLY FLOWING
HE FOUND IT ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY AND WAS THUS ENABLED TO ACCOMPLISH HIS BUSINESS SATISFACTORILY
TO HIS GRATIFICATION IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HIS EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WERE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
RETURNING WITH THE BODY OF THE HERO AND MARTYR STILL IN COMPANY WITH MRS BROWN MR MCKIM PROCEEDED TO NORTH ELBA WHERE HE AND WENDELL PHILLIPS WHO HAD JOINED HIM IN NEW YORK WITH A FEW OTHER FRIENDS GATHERED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSISTED IN THE FINAL OBSEQUIES

HE THUS TYRANNIZED OVER ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE HEAD
I STATED MY ERRAND TO HIM WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
AT THAT TIME C
HIS NAME IS CHAS
JOHN BOWED AND THANKED THE GOVERNOR AND SOON GOT READY FOR HIS VISIT
TO THIS I MAINTAIN AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER
THEY WERE CAPTURED HERE WITHIN SIGHT OF OUR HOUSE
FREEDOM WAS GAINED ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT THE SAD LOSS OF HER TWO OLDER CHILDREN WHOM SHE HAD TO LEAVE BEHIND
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SUCCESS IN FRIGHTENING OFF THE OLD MAN CHARLES FELT THAT THE THICKET WAS BY NO MEANS A SAFE PLACE FOR HIM
QUARLES ON MAY STREET OPPISIT THE JEWS SYNAGOGUE AND CALL FOR MARENA MERCER GIVE MY LOVE TO HER ASK HER OF ALL THE TIMES ABOUT RICHMOND TELL HER TO SEND ME ALL THE NEWS
HE IMAGINED HIS MISTRESS IN A FIT OF PERPLEXITY SUCH AS HE MIGHT ENJOY COULD HE PEEP AT HER FROM CANADA OR SOME SAFE PLACE
FURTHERMORE THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO BREAK HIS FETTERS AND SEEK HIS FREEDOM IN CANADA
THEY WERE CONSIDERED ENTITLED TO MUCH PITY

TRULY THY FRIEND MARY B
THOUGH SHE DEPLORED THE MEANS HER SOUL MUST HAVE EXULTED IN THE RESULT
SHE WAS BAD IN THIS WAY SHE WAS QUARRELSOME AND THEN AGAIN SHE WOULD NOT GIVE YOU AS MUCH TO EAT AS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE AND IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH
THE CORDS WHICH BOUND HIS WRISTS WERE UNLOOSED AND GEORGE WAS THEN PREPARED TO STRIKE FOR FREEDOM AT THE MOUTH OF THE CANNON OR POINT OF THE BAYONET
WHAT IS POLITICAL ACTION
BESIDES HE WAS A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
STILL:--OUR PAPPERS CONTAINS LONG DETAILS OF INSURRECTIONARY MOVEMENTS AMONG THE SLAVES AT THE SOUTH AND ONE PAPER ADDS THAT A GREAT NOMBER OF GENERALS CAPTAINS WITH OTHER OFFICERS HAD BEING ARRESTED
FROM THAT TIME HE HAD SEEN NEITHER MOTHER NOR SISTER--THEY WERE SOLD SEPARATELY
HE THEREFORE WISELY CONCLUDED TO AVOID THE IMPENDING DANGER BY AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
HE DECLARED THAT POLLARD THOUGHT NO MORE OF HIS SERVANTS THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN DOGS
HE WILL FIND ME BY THE ENCLOSED CARD WHICH SHALL BE A SATISFACTORY INTRODUCTION FOR HIM

WE SHALL BE INTERESTED IN ANY PARTICULARS YOU MAY LIKE TO SEND US OF THESE POOR CREATURES BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DARE NOT HOLD OUT ANY HOPES OF CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE FROM ENGLAND FOR OUR OWN MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS ARE IN A STARVING STATE FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE ACCUSTOMED SUPPLY OF COTTON AND TILL THIS HAS BEEN GROWN IN OTHER QUARTERS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A STRONG CLAIM ON EVERY THOUGHTFUL MIND
HE BELIEVED IN WOMAN AS ONLY A THOROUGHLY GOOD MAN CAN AND FROM EARLY YOUTH HE HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WITH HER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE
JAMES LEFT HIS MOTHER NANCY KELL TWO BROTHERS ROBERT AND HENRY AND TWO SISTERS MARY AND ANNIE
ROBINSON ALIAS THOS
BELIEVING THAT A SLAVE HAD NO BUSINESS TO GET TIRED OR DESIRE HIS FREEDOM
AFTER THE LIMB WAS WORN OUT HE THEN WENT OUT TO THE YARD AND GOT A LATH AND HE COME AT ME AGAIN AND BEAT ME WITH THAT UNTIL HE BROKE IT ALL TO PIECES
AT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS MEETING THE NATION WAS CONVULSED WITH LAUGHTER BUT WHO LAUGHS NOW AT THIS IRRESISTIBLE REFORM
FULLY PERSUADED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER FIND HER LOT ANY BETTER WHILE REMAINING IN THEIR HANDS SHE ACCEPTED THE ADVICE AND AID OF A YOUNG MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS ENGAGED
EZRA HOUPT WAS THE NAME OF HENRY'S MASTER AND THE NAME OF HIS MISTRESS WAS CATHARINE SHE WAS HASTY AND PASSIONATE
I SEE OUR FRIEND MISS WATKINS IS STILL PLEADING FOR THE DUMB
JOHN PINKET AND ANSAL CANNON TOOK THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD CARS AT NEW MARKET DORCHESTER COUNTY MARYLAND
ANN MARIA WEEMS ALIAS JOE WRIGHT--GREAT TRIUMPH--ARRIVAL ON THANKSGIVING DAY--INTERESTING LETTERS FROM J
OUR ARMY HAD BEEN THROUGH AND THIS POOR ILL-FATED GIRL ALMOST A CHILD IN YEARS ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE REJOICED OVER THE EVENT AND SAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY A YANKEE AND SET UP HOUSEKEEPING
I AM GLAD THEE DID KEEP THE TEN FOR THE FUGITIVES
THE PERSON OF CHRIST IN A BLACK SKIN WOULD SCARCELY HAVE CAUSED IT TO RELINQUISH ITS TYRANNICAL GRASP
HE LIVED IN GRASON COUNTY
HE SAID THEY WILL GO ON TO-MORROW IN THE STAGE--HE TOOK DOWN THE NUMBER AND STREET OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE--YOU WILL BE ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST IMPOSITION--HE KEPT THE LETTER THEE SENT FROM NORFOLK
JERRY MILLS AND WIFE DIANA SON CORNELIUS AND TWO DAUGHTERS MARGARET AND SUSAN
SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT HER HUSBAND HAD DIED LEAVING HER WITH TWO LITTLE GIRLS TO CARE FOR BOTH OF WHOM SHE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING AWAY WITH HER
THE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE TO WHOM IT WAS SENT WITH THE REQUEST THAT IT SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO HER DID NOT MEET WITH THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO
WHEN WE RECEIVE OUR APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNMENT
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THIS TIME HOWEVER HIS SYMPTOMS CHANGED INDICATING NOT ONLY THE END OF SLAVERY BUT ALSO THE END OF ALL HIS EARTHLY TROUBLES
I LECTURED IN A PLACE WHERE THEY SEEMED TO HAVE NO OTHER CHURCH
ALSO HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF AN EDUCATION AND HAD KEPT HIM IN POVERTY AND IGNORANCE ALL HIS LIFE
NOT UNTIL AFTER THE FOREGOING STORY HEADED THE ESCAPE OF A CHILD ETC HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRINTER AND WAS IN TYPE WAS THE STORY OF THE MOTHER DISCOVERED ALTHOUGH IT WAS AMONG THE RECORDS PRESERVED

WILL YOU PLEASE SIR DIRECT YOUR LETTER IN REPLY TO THIS TO A MRS RINGGOLD CENTRE STREET TWO DOORS FROM ELAM STREET TORONTO CANADA WEST AS I WILL BE OUT OF TOWN
HE LOVED TO TALK OF INTERESTING CASES OF REFORM AND RECOVERY BOTH BECAUSE THOSE THINGS OCCUPIED HIS MIND AND BECAUSE EVERY ONE LOVED TO HEAR HIM
THE ORDER OF THE DAY WAS LITERALLY AS FAR AS COLORED MEN WERE CONCERNED
Q
HE HAD HEARD OF CANADA HAD FORMED A VERY FAVORABLE OPINION OF THE COUNTRY AND WAS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING IT
MY MISTRESS WAS A PRETTY CROSS CURIOUS KIND OF A WOMAN TOO THOUGH SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH
SARAH A
SLAVERY BROUGHT ABOUT MANY RADICAL CHANGES SOME IN ONE WAY AND SOME IN ANOTHER
IN ORDER TO SERVE THE GOVERNOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE BY SALE WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS ESCAPE
YOURS VERY TRULY JOSEPH BALL
AND BUT FOR HIS ATTEMPT SOME MONTHS BACK TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS DAY IN THE CARE OF HIS KIND-HEARTED MASTER
CONSEQUENTLY HE BECAME QUITE RESTIVE UNDER THESE REFLECTIONS AND HIS MASTER'S ILL-USAGE AND CONCLUDED TO LOOK OUT WITHOUT CONSULTING EITHER THE MASTER OR THE YOUNG WIFE
NO BETTER MATERIAL FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT COULD BE FOUND THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN GATHERED FROM THE INCIDENTS OF THEIR LIVES AND TRAVELS
SMITH WHO OWNED HIM
THEREFORE AFTER LEAVING THE SUBURBS OF WASHINGTON THE DOCTOR TOOK THE REINS IN HIS OWN HANDS AS HE FELT THAT HE WAS MORE EXPERIENCED AS A DRIVER THAN HIS YOUNG COACHMAN
PREPARATION WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE TO GIVE THE FUGITIVES A KIND RECEPTION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO DESTROY THEIR PLAGUES ROOT AND BRANCH WITHOUT MERCY
IN 1856 WILLIAM WRIGHT WAS A DELEGATE FROM ADAMS COUNTY TO THE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA WHICH NOMINATED JOHN C
ANTHONY WAS DECIDEDLY OPPOSED TO HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THIS ORDEAL A FOURTH TIME THEREFORE THE MORE HE MEDITATED OVER HIS CONDITION THE MORE DETERMINED HE BECAME TO SEEK OUT AN UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AGENT AND MAKE HIS WAY TO CANADA

I TOLD HIM I WOULD NOT BE THERE
KIRK AND H.G
INTERESTING TO THE LITERARY WORLD IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FACILITATE THE REUNION OF OTHER COLORED FAMILIES LONG DIVIDED LONG SOUGHT FOR AND PERHAPS TO THIS DAY STRANGERS TO EACH OTHER
THUS YOU SEE HOW WE ARE SITUATED FINANCIALLY
FIFTEEN SLAVES WITH OTHER STOCK WERE KEPT ON THE PLACE
AND WHAT A DOUBLE WRATH WILL BE POURED ON HIM WHO CRACKS THE WAX AND THE VARNISH NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE RUDE AWAKENING BUT BECAUSE THE CRACK SHOWS THE SHAM
JOSEPH WAS OF A DARK ORANGE COLOR MEDIUM SIZE VERY ACTIVE AND INTELLIGENT AND DOUBTLESS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF BEHAVING HIMSELF
AND WHILST THESE ARTICLES WERE IN THE VERY ACT OF RUNNING AWAY WITH THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIND MASTER'S BEST HORSES AND CARRIAGE--WHEN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM HOME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CHEAT RIVER MARYLAND THEY WERE ATTACKED BY SIX WHITE MEN AND A BOY WHO DOUBTLESS SUPPOSING THAT THEIR INTENTIONS WERE OF A WICKED AND UNLAWFUL CHARACTER FELT IT TO BE THEIR DUTY IN KINDNESS TO THEIR MASTERS IF NOT TO THE TRAVELERS TO DEMAND OF THEM AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT HER HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE EVEN THE MOST RELENTLESS SLAVEHOLDER TO ABANDON AT ONCE A PURSUIT SO MONSTROUS AND UTTERLY HOPELESS AS WHEELER'S WAS
WE HAVE SPENT QUITE AGREEABLE WINTER WE WARE EMPLOIED IN THE NEW HOTEL NAME ANGLO AMERICAN WHEARE WE WINTERED AND DON VERY WELL WE ALSO MET WITH OUR TOO FRENDS HO CAME FROM HOME WITH US JONAS ANDERSON AND IZEAS NOW WE ARE ALL SAFE IN HAMILTON I WISH TO CALE YOU TO YOURE PROMMOS IF CONVENIENT TO WRITE TO NORFOLK VA FOR ME AND LET MY WIFE MARY ELEN BROWN NO WHERE I AM AND MY BROTHERS WIFE ELICKZENER BROWN AS WE HAVE NEVER HEARD A WORD FROM THEM SINCE WE LEFT TEL THEM THAT WE FOUND OUR HOMES AND SITUATION IN CANADY MUCH BETTER THAN WE EXPECTED TEL THEM NOT TO THINK HARD OF US WE WAS BOUN TO FLEE FROM THE RATH TO COME TEL THEM WE LIVE IN THE HOPES OF METING THEM ONCE MORE THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE TEL THEM IF WE NEVER MORE SEE THEM WE HOPE TO MEET THEM IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IN PECE TEL THEM TO REMEMBER MY LOVE TO MY CHERCH AND BRETHREN TEL THEM I FIND THERE IS THE SAME PRAYER-HEARING GOD HEARE AS THERE IS IN OLD VA
SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYTHING BUT A GIRL AND WAS NOT MARRIED AND SHE OF COURSE COULD NOT BE IN THE CONDITION OF A MARRIED WOMAN
HE WAS THEREFORE ONE OF THE MOST WILLING-HEARTED PASSENGERS IN THE PARTY
BUT IT IS A TERRIBLE THING ALTOGETHER
GEORGE LEWIS HAD MORE YEARS THAN ANY OF HIS COMPANIONS BEING ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
THEREFORE THE LAND OF SLAVE-WHIPS AND AUCTION-BLOCKS HAD NO CHARMS FOR HIM
I SAW THE ALLEGED FUGITIVE SOME FIVE YEARS BEFORE 1830 AT GEORGE AMOS IN UWCHLAND TOWNSHIP SOME EIGHT OR TEN MILES FROM OUR HOUSE
BUT FOR THIS TREATMENT THOMAS MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN SOME DEGREE CONTENTED IN SLAVERY
IN ORDER TO EFFECT HIS ESCAPE ROBERT WAS OBLIGED TO SWIM THE POTOMAC RIVER ON HORSEBACK ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT WHILE THE COLD WIND STORM AND DARKNESS WERE INDESCRIBABLY DISMAL
WOULD THAT GOD WOULD WRITE IT INDELIBLY ON THE HEART OF THE NATION
HOWEVER THEY MANAGED TO GET SAFELY ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TRACK AND BY PERSEVERANCE THEY REACHED THE COMMITTEE AND WERE AIDED IN THE USUAL MANNER
WITH HEAVY PECUNIARY LOSSES SAD DAMAGE OF CHARACTER AND COMFORTLESS THE UNHAPPY CLAIMANT AND HIS WITNESSES WERE COMPELLED TO RETURN TO MARYLAND WISER IF NOT BETTER MEN
THE FOLLOWING SAD EXPERIENCE SHE RELATED CALMLY IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL FRIENDS AN EVENING OR TWO AFTER SHE LEFT HER MISTRESS
OUR MASTERS HAVE TOLD US THAT THERE WAS NO LIVING IN CANADA FOR A NEGRO BUT IF IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GENTLEMANSHIP TO PUBLISH THESE FACTS THAT WE ARE HERE ABLE TO EARN OUR BREAD AND MONEY ENOUGH TO MAKE US COMFTABLE
I WAS TIED AND MR HENRY WAS SENT FOR
WHILE IN THE WOODS ALL MY THOUGHTS WAS HOW TO GET AWAY TO A FREE COUNTRY ILLUSTRATION
BUT THEIR MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT WAS ALMOST OSTRACISED AT THIS TIME BY THE DRY GOODS MERCHANTS
THOMAS SHIPLEY WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY AND WAS AN ACTIVE AGENT IN THOSE STIRRING MOVEMENTS WHICH SOON AROUSED THE NATION TO A FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE ENORMITIES OF SLAVERY
JACKSON ROBT 495
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS NOT PRUDENT OR SAFE IN THE DAYS OF SLAVERY TO PUBLISH SUCH FACTS AS ARE NOW BROUGHT TO LIGHT
FITZGERALD 7 ADAM STREET STRAND LONDON
SHE KNEW THAT RUM RUINED THE BEST OF SLAVE-HOLDERS SO SHE WAS ADMONISHED TO GET OUT OF DANGER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
ALL THAT HE COULD SAY IN FAVOR OF HIS MASTER WAS THAT HE TREATED HIM RESPECTFULLY THOUGH HE DRANK HARD ISRAEL WAS ABOUT THIRTY-SIX AND ANOTHER EXCELLENT SPECIMEN OF AN ABLE-BODIED AND WIDE-AWAKE MAN
NOW PLEASE GIVE ME THE NAME OF THE FUGITIVE HIS AGE SIZE AND COLOR AND WHERE HE MAY BE FOUND HOW LONG HE HAS BEEN AWAY AND THE WITNESS WHO CAN BE RELIED ON TO IDENTIFY HIM AFTER HE IS ARRESTED MISS WILSON CAREFULLY COMMUNICATED THESE IMPORTANT PARTICULARS WHILE MR WHITSON FAITHFULLY PENCILED DOWN EVERY WORD
ONE OF THEM THINKS HE HAS A BROTHER AND COUSIN IN NEW BEDFORD AND IS ANXIOUS TO GET TO THEM THE OTHERS THEE CAN DO WHAT THEE THINKS BEST WITH AFTER CONSULTING WITH THEM WE HAVE RIGGED THEM UP PRETTY COMFORTABLY WITH CLOTHES AND I HAVE PAID FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO PHILADELPHIA AND ALSO FOR THE PASSAGE OF THEIR PILOT THERE AND BACK
I HAVE LIVED IN THE MIDST OF OPPRESSION AND WRONG AND I AM SADDENED BY EVERY CAPTURED FUGITIVE IN THE NORTH
ON LEAVING HOME HE SIMPLY TOOK TWO OR THREE SMALL ARTICLES IN THE WAY OF APPAREL WITH ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO DEFRAY HIS EXPENSES FOR A TIME

PASSMORE WILLIAMSON WHO HAD TAKEN A DEEP INTEREST IN THE EXAMINATION OF HIS CASE IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING NOTE TO MAJOR RONEY USING AS HIS SIGNATURE THE NAME OF HIS FRIEND WM

WITH RESPECTS C
NOTHING CAN BE SAID TO THEIR CREDIT WHICH THEY DO NOT DESERVE
FURNESS D.D TO A LADY WHO HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIM THROUGH ALL HIS SORE TRIALS AND SUFFERINGS HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FOR WESTERN NEW YORK WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE AND AN UNSHAKEN FAITH IN THE BELIEF THAT IN AIDING HIS FELLOW-MAN TO FREEDOM HE HAD BUT SIMPLY OBEYED THE WORD OF HIM WHO TAUGHT MAN TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS HE WOULD BE DONE BY
IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ASSISTANT COUNSEL FOR THE STATE SLAVERY MUST BE PROTECTED OR IT MUST BE ABOLISHED FROM THE SAME SHEET OF MAY 20TH THE TERRIBLE DOOM OF SAMUEL GREEN IS ANNOUNCED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
I HAD AN INTERESTING CALL A WEEK AGO FROM TWO GENTLEMEN MASTERS OF VESSELS AND BROTHERS ONE OF WHOM I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW AS THE POWDER BOY I HAD A LITTLE LIGHT FREIGHT FOR THEM
HE HAD FOUND IT PRETTY HARD TO MEET HIS MONTHLY HIRE CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS ON THE LOOK-OUT TO BETTER HIS CONDITION AS SOON AS A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY MIGHT OFFER
THE AIR WAS THICK WITH VAGUE APPREHENSION AND RUMOR SO MUCH SO THAT SOME OF DR FURNESS'S DEVOTED PARISHIONERS WHO FOLLOWED HIS ABOLITIONISM BUT NOT HIS NON-RESISTANCE CAME ARMED TO CHURCH UNCERTAIN WHAT AN HOUR MIGHT BRING FORTH OR IN WHAT SHAPE OF MOB VIOLENCE OR ASSASSINATION THE BLOW WOULD FALL
AS HE WAS RUNNING PETE CAUTIOUSLY CAST HIS EYE OVER HIS SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS OLD MASTER WHEN TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE FOUND THAT A REGULAR CHASE WAS BEING MADE AFTER HIM
THE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE IN HARRISBURG HAD IT IS PROBABLE FREQUENTLY LEFT ROOM FOR THEIR GREAT DELUSION IF HE DID NOT EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO FEED THEIR HOPES WITH PLAUSIBLE SUGGESTIONS THAT SOME ASSISTANCE MIGHT BE AFFORDED BY WHICH AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT MIGHT BE MADE BETWEEN MASTERS AND SLAVES
AFTER THEY HAD TALKED TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT AND AFTER THEY HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND CHANGED IN APPAREL THEIR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE COULD BE EASILY DISCERNED WHICH MADE IT LESS A WONDER WHENCE SUCH OUTBURSTS OF ELOQUENCE HAD EMANATED
WHAT OTHER EVENTS FOLLOWED IN DANIEL'S LIFE AS A FUGITIVE WERE NEVER MADE KNOWN TO THE COMMITTEE
HE FLED FROM THE MEED ESTATE
HENRY FLED FROM BUCKSTOWN DORCHESTER CO MD MARCH 1857
THOMAS LEFT ONLY ONE BROTHER LIVING
THOU WILT OBSERVE THERE IS NO REFERENCE EITHER TO THY OWN NAME OR TO PHILADELPHIA AND PEOPLE HERE ARE NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH AMERICAN TOPOGRAPHY
GOD HAD SHADED HIM A LITTLE TOO MUCH
21
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN SHE HAS NO PECULIARITY OF VOICE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER WAS PULLED UP AND WARMLY GREETED UNTIL IT CAME THE TURN OF A LARGE OBJECT WEIGHING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS FULL LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE TWO ORDINARY WOMEN
FOR HIS SERVICES IN THIS STORE THE WIDOW HAD BEEN DRAWING ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER ANNUM CLEAR OF ALL EXPENSES
HE ANSWERED NO AND PRETENDED TO BE ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THEIR BEING IN HIS BARN
AT THE TIME THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN SHE WAS THEN UNDER MR B.'S PROTECTION IN WASHINGTON AND HAD TO BE SO KEPT FOR SIX WEEKS
BUT I THOUGHT IF I MADE UP MY MIND TO STAY IN SLAVERY AND NOT TO MAKE A DESPERATE TRIAL FOR MY FREEDOM I WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY BETTER TIMES
THE WAY IN WHICH CAPTAIN LEE CAME TO BE CONVICTED IF THE COMMITTEE WERE CORRECTLY INFORMED AND THEY THINK THEY WERE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IN THIS WISE

RICHMOND VA FEBRUARY 16TH 1861
IN THE PRESENT CASE THEY WERE PREPARED FOR A GALLANT STAND AND A LONG SIEGE AGAINST OPPOSING FORCES
STILL:--THIS EVENING I SEND TO THY CARE FOUR OF GOD'S POOR
THIR WIR SIX MEN AND TWO WOMAN WAS BETRAID ON THE TENTH OF THIS MONTH THEA HAD THEM IN PRISON BUT THEA GOT OUT WAS CONVEYED BY A BLACK MAN HE TOLD THEM HE WOOD BRING THEM TO MY HOWS AS HE WOS TOLD HE HAD BEN THER BEFOR HE HAS COM WITH HARRETT A WOMAN THAT STOPS AT MY HOUS WHEN SHE PASES TOW AND THROW YAU
ENJOYS GOOD HEALTH VIGOR AND PEACE OF MIND IN HER OLD DAYS WITH A SMALL INCOME JUST SUFFICIENT TO MEET HER HUMBLE WANTS WITHOUT HAVING TO LIVE AT SERVICE
THE WOMAN WITH HER CHILDREN WERE HURRIED INTO A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS DRIVEN FIRST TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE AND THEN TO THE PHILADELPHIA INSTITUTE IN LOMBARD STREET ABOVE SEVENTH
THE PRISONERS THOUGHT THEY WERE BACK IN OLD VIRGINNY AGAIN
MRS WALKER THE BIG FAT WOMAN WAS THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AND A PLEASANT-LOOKING PERSON OF A VERY DARK HUE
CONSEQUENTLY HE HUNG ON TO IT EVEN AFTER STARTING ON HIS VOYAGE TO CANADA
WHILE THERE A CONSTABLE NAMED SMITH TOOK HIM BEFORE A MAGISTRATE NAMED GRAHAM WHO FINED HIM FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS FOR VIOLATING THE LAW IN RELATION TO FREE NEGROES COMING INTO THE STATE
HE HAD REACHED THE COMMITTEE THROUGH THE REGULAR CHANNEL--WAS ADJUDGED WORTHY OF AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT AND THEY GAVE IT TO HIM FREELY
IF HE HAD KEPT ME IN A HOGSHEAD OF SUGAR I WOULDN'T STAYED SAID THE BRIGHT-MINDED SLAVE YOUTH
GIVE IF YOU PLEASE MY BEST LOVE TO YOUR FAMILY AND ACCEPT THE SAME FOR YOURSELF AND ALSO TO MR JAMES ORMSTED AND FAMILY
AN ACT RESPECTING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE AND PERSONS ESCAPING FROM THE SERVICE OF THEIR MASTERS BE IT ENACTED BY THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED
JACOB BLOCKSON GEORGE ALLIGOOD JIM ALLIGOOD AND GEORGE LEWIS
THE WORN AND WEARY HAVE RESTED THEIR FAINTING HEADS UPON HER BOSOM AND GATHERED STRENGTH FROM HER WORDS AND COURAGE FROM HER COUNSELS
FIFTY-SEVEN YEARS WERE PASSED IN BONDAGE BEFORE SHE REACHED PHILADELPHIA
THIS LETTER WAS IN ANSWER TO ONE WRITTEN IN PHILADELPHIA AND SIGNED L.W
ABOUT THE 31ST OF MAY 1856 AN EXCEEDINGLY ANXIOUS STATE OF FEELING EXISTED WITH THE ACTIVE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
AND IN LOOKING BACK NOW OVER THESE STRANGE AND EVENTFUL PROVIDENCES IN THE LIGHT OF THE WONDERFUL CHANGES WROUGHT BY EMANCIPATION I AM MORE AND MORE CONSTRAINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE REASONS WHICH YEARS AGO LED ME TO AID THE BONDMAN AND PRESERVE THE RECORDS OF HIS SUFFERINGS ARE TO-DAY QUITE AS POTENT IN CONVINCING ME THAT THE NECESSITY OF THE TIMES REQUIRES THIS TESTIMONY
THE EXCITEMENT BEING GREAT FRIEND COCHRAN DID NOT CONSIDER IT SAFE FOR THEM TO GO TO THE DEPOT DIRECT
MY JOY WAS SHORT-LIVED
THE NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS WERE AS FOLLOWS
JOHN WAS OWNED BY ONE JAMES B
HE CHARGED ONE ELIJAH J
AND NO ANTI-SLAVERY MINISTER ENJOYS MORE UNIVERSAL RESPECT
ONCE OR TWICE HE SECRETLY MANAGED TO GET AN INTERVIEW WITH HIS MOTHER AND ONE OF HIS SISTERS BY WHOM HE WAS PERSUADED TO RETURN TO HIS MASTER
THENCEFORTH HE DECIDED TO TREASURE UP EVERY DOLLAR HE COULD GET HOLD OF UNTIL HE COULD ACCUMULATE AT LEAST ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF OLD VIRGINIA HE WAS A MARRIED MAN AND THOUGHT HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD BUT ON REFLECTION HE FOUND OUT THAT THEY DID NOT ACTUALLY BELONG TO HIM BUT TO A CARPENTER BY THE NAME OF BAILEY
IN PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW ENGLAND HE RECEIVED HIS SCHOLASTIC EDUCATION FINISHING IT AT AMHERST COLLEGE
TRULY THERE IS NO NEED TO PREACH ABOUT SLAVERY IN THE ABSTRACT THIS INDIVIDUAL CASE COMBINES EVERY WICKEDNESS BY WHICH HUMAN NATURE CAN BE DEGRADED
THEN WITH INDESCRIBABLE FEELINGS OF SYMPATHY FREE TICKETS WERE TENDERED THEM AND THEY HAVING BEEN CONDUCTED TO THE DEPOT WERE SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING
AND OUR GOD DOTH RISE IN JUDGMENT FOR THE POOR AND NEEDY'S SAKE
NEXT WEEK CONTINUED MRS HARPER I AM TO SPEAK IN A PLACE WHERE ONE OF OUR TEACHERS WAS STRUCK AND A COLORED MAN SHOT WHO I BELIEVE GAVE OFFENCE BY SOME WORDS SPOKEN AT A PUBLIC MEETING
A FEW YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER HIS FATHER WAS REMOVED AND THOMAS WAS LEFT AN ORPHAN BEFORE HE HAD ATTAINED HIS SIXTH YEAR
FOST
YET HE HAD NOT SUFFERED AS MANY OTHERS HAD WHO BELONGED TO THEM AS HE HAD BEEN A DINING-ROOM SERVANT

OLD MASTER AND MISTRESS AND YOUNG MASTER AND MISTRESS INCLUDING THE ENTIRE FAMILY BELONGED TO WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE FARMER CHURCH AT PORTSVILLE
HOWEVER HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF THOUGH ONLY FOR A SHORT SEASON FOR BEFORE A GREAT WHILE AN EXCESSIVE FAINTNESS CAME OVER HIM
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER LIVING IN ROCKVILLE
HER MIND WAS DEEPLY IMBUED WITH RELIGIOUS FEELING AND AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN GOD AS HER ONLY TRUST
HERE HE REMAINED FOR SEVERAL YEARS ACQUIRING THE COMMON RUDIMENTS OF EDUCATION AND AT A SUITABLE AGE WAS SENT TO WESTTOWN SCHOOL
THOMPSON WAS PRONOUNCED NOT GUILTY THE OTHER PRISONERS OF COURSE SHARED THE SAME GOOD LUCK
FREE AIR HAD A POWERFUL EFFECT ON SUCH PASSENGERS AS SAMUEL SPARROWS
EZEKIEL JENKINS MIFFLIN WARNER AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS WHOLE-SOULED WORKERS IN THE SAME CAUSE WITH HUNN
MR SYRUS AND HIS LADY IS WELL SITUATED
MAY EVERY SUCCESS ATTEND THY LABORS FOR THE POOR SUFFERERS
SHE ONLY RAGED WUS SHE TURNED THE BUTT END OF THE COWHIDE AND STRUCK ME FIVE OR SIX BLOWS OVER MY HEAD AS HARD AS SHE COULD
$300 REWARD IS OFFERED FOR THE APPREHENSION OF NEGRO WOMAN REBECCA JONES AND HER THREE CHILDREN AND MAN ISAIAH BELONGING TO W.W
HE COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF THE HANDCUFFS
WHILE GOING BACK TO THE WOODS I WAS SHOT IN THE THIGH LEGS BACK AND HEAD WAS BADLY WOUNDED MY MIND WAS TO DIE RATHER THAN BE TAKEN
HE BELONGED TO A FAMILY BEARING THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN AND WAS SAID TO BE AN M.D
COFFIN LEVI 33
WHEN I GOT TO THE STORE SOME OF THE CONCERN LET MR HENRY KNOW THAT A MAN WANTED TO SEE HIM
HE WAS EXPECTED TO LOOK AFTER THE FIRES IN THE HOUSE ON SUNDAY MORNINGS
THE DUTIES OF THIS DEPARTMENT OF ANTI-SLAVERY LABOR HAVE FOR WANT OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION BEEN PERFORMED IN A VERY LOOSE AND UNSYSTEMATIC MANNER
CHEERS HENCEFORTH THROUGH ALL COMING TIME ADVOCATES OF JUSTICE AND FRIENDS OF REFORM BE NOT DISCOURAGED
BUT THE SMOKE WAS SUCH THAT THE EFFORT PROVED INEFFECTUAL
NOT EVEN ALLOWING HIM THE PRIVILEGE OF VISITING AROUND ON NEIGHBORING PLANTATIONS
YOURS TRULY OTHO TAYLOR
FROM THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD JUST AS OUR PAPER IS GOING TO PRESS THERE COMES TO US INTELLIGENCE OF THE DEATH OF OUR BELOVED AND REVERED FRIEND ESTHER MOORE WIDOW OF THE LATE DR ROBERT MOORE OF PHILADELPHIA
HUGHLETT A FARMER AND DEALER IN SHIP TIMBER WHO HAD BESIDES INVESTED IN SLAVES TO THE NUMBER OF FORTY HEAD
THE PRISONERS HAVING LAIN IN THEIR CELLS NEARLY THREE MONTHS THE TIME FOR THEIR TRIAL ARRIVED
HE WAS SO MEAN THAT HE BROKE UP ALL THE PRIVILEGES THE SERVANTS HAD BEFORE HE CAME
ACCOMMODATIONS WERE FINALLY PROCURED FOR A NUMBER OF THE FUGITIVES WITH A WIDOW WOMAN ANN LAWS WHOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCOR WERE FAR LESS THAN AT THE PLACES WHERE REFUSALS HAD BEEN MET WITH
IN HIS THREE SUITS OF CLOTHING ALL ON HIS BACK HE WALKED ON THE BOAT AND WAS CONDUCTED TO THE COAL COVERING WHERE EGYPTIAN DARKNESS PREVAILED
DAY AND NIGHT HE STUDIED WORKED AND PLANNED WITH FREEDOM UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND
JOHNSON JOHN 430
HE WAS THEREFORE TAKEN TO THE LEWISES SUFFERING VERY MUCH IN HIS REMOVAL AND ARRIVING IN A CONDITION WHICH REQUIRED THE MOST ASSIDUOUS CARE

A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARDS A BROTHER AND SISTER WERE SOLD SOUTH
HE STATED THAT HE HAD A WIFE LIVING IN RICHMOND AND THAT SHE WAS CONFINED THE MORNING HE TOOK THE U.G.R.R
IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER BEING IN NEW BEDFORD BEFORE THE BOY WAS PUT TO A TRADE AND THE DAUGHTER WAS SENT TO BOSTON WHERE SHE HAD AN AUNT A FUGITIVE LIVING IN THE FAMILY OF THE HON

DUTTON MARSHALL 99
HANDY ANOTHER OF THIS PARTY SAID THAT HE LEFT BECAUSE THE MAN WHO CLAIMED TO BE HIS MASTER WAS SO HARD THE MAN BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN WRONGED WAS KNOWN WHERE HE CAME FROM BY THE NAME OF SHEPHERD BURTON AND WAS IN THE FARMING BUSINESS
BUT BOTH JULIA AND HER HUSBAND HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF SLAVERY TO LEAVE NO ROOM TO HOPE THAT THEY COULD EVER FIND PEACE OR REST SO LONG AS THEY REMAINED
HE HAD BECOME ENAMORED OF A YOUNG AND RESPECTABLE FREE GIRL IN RICHMOND WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT BE UNITED IN MARRIAGE SOLELY BECAUSE HE WAS A SLAVE AND DID NOT OWN HIMSELF
SEEMINGLY NO SYSTEM OF INIQUITY WAS EVER MORE STRONGLY INTRENCHED OR MORE SURE AND ABSOLUTE IN ITS SWAY THAN THAT OF AMERICAN SLAVERY
SOME OF US WOULD RATHER WORK WITH YOUR COLORED PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN CAUSE THAN WITH ANY ONE ELSE FOR WE DO NOT LIKE THE WAR AND DO NOT AT ALL APPROVE OF THE AMERICAN CHURCHES COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO IT SO FEARFULLY
TOTAL L8
THE THREE BROTHERS WERE INTELLIGENT AND HEROIC AND IN THE RESOLVE TO OBTAIN FREEDOM NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN DESPERATELY IN EARNEST
HOW MUCH IT WOULD TAKE FROM OUR PLEASURE IF ALL THE BIRDS WERE DRESSED IN DRAB YES SHE REPLIED BUT IMMORTAL BEINGS DO NOT DEPEND UPON FEATHERS FOR THEIR ATTRACTIONS
MURRAY ROBT 508
LOOKING AT THE MEN AS THEY ARE AS YOU WILL I SAY THAT THE TESTIMONY EXHIBITED ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENT WOULD OUTWEIGH A WHOLE THEATRE OF SUCH MEN AS ARE EXHIBITED ON THE PART OF THE COMPLAINANT
HERE FURTHER AID WAS AFFORDED THEM AND AS DANGER WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIVIDED AND DISGUISED SO THAT THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT THEY MIGHT SAFELY BE SENT ON TO CANADA IN ONE OF THE REGULAR TRAINS CONSIDERED MOST PRIVATE
IT WAS AN EASY MATTER FOR A TRAVELER TO GET LOST NOT KNOWING THE ROADS NOR WAS IT SAFE TO APPLY TO A STRANGER FOR INFORMATION OR DIRECTION--THEREFORE IN MANY INSTANCES THE JOURNEY WOULD EITHER HAVE TO BE GIVEN UP OR BE PROSECUTED SUFFERING ALMOST TO THE DEATH
IN THESE CASES THE JURY COULD GIVE NEITHER LESS NOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PENALTIES ON THE PROPER PROOF BEING MADE
SUCCESS ATTENDED HIS EFFORTS FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS
WHILE WE SEEM TO HEAR AS IT WERE THE VOICES OF THE GREAT AND THE GOOD THE PATRIOT AND THE PHILANTHROPIST OF A PAST GENERATION CALLING TO US AND CHEERING US ON
THAT FROM HIS ACKNOWLEDGED STANDING IN THE LITERARY WORLD AND AS A LEADER IN THE INTERESTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION HIS PATH BROUGHT HIM INTO CONTACT MAINLY WITH THE CULTURED AND IT WAS AMONG THESE THAT THE PRO-SLAVERY SPIRIT RULED WITH ITS BITTEREST STRINGENCY
SLAVERY DEMANDED ALL BUT ALLOWED NOTHING
MR SCOTT FOR HENRY SCOTT WAS THE NAME HE WAS A FUGITIVE FROM VIRGINIA HE CAME HERE FROM PITTSBURG PA
THE DOCTOR WAS READILY RECOGNIZED BY THE FARMER AND HIS FAMILY WHO SEEMED GLAD TO SEE HIM
LEWIS TAPPAN OF NEW YORK WOULD RECEIVE TO TRANSMIT AND I WOULD REPORT NOW IF WE MAY LAY BEFORE YOU DEAR FRIENDS OUR HEARTS INQUIRY IT IS THIS
HAD NOT HUNGER AND CRUELTY AND PROSTITUTION DONE THEIR WORK AND LEFT HER AN ENTIRE WRECK FOR LIFE
SLAVERY AS HE VIEWED IT WAS NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN DOWNRIGHT ROBBERY
HIS OLD FATHER HAD BOUGHT HIMSELF AND WAS FREE
FOR YEARS THE HOPE OF FREEDOM HAD OCCUPIED HIS THOUGHTS AND MANY HAD BEEN THE LONGING DESIRES TO SEE THE WAY OPEN BY WHICH HE COULD SAFELY GET RID OF OPPRESSION
MARIA IS THAT YOU
FOR PRUDENTIAL REASONS THE CAPTAIN THREATENED TO THROW HIM OVER-BOARD
IT IS A PERFECT GOSPEL A WHOLE BIBLE OF MIND-ENLIGHTENING HEART-CLEANSING SOUL-SAVING TRUTH
HE WAS AN OLD MAN BUT VERY CRUEL TO ALL HIS SLAVES IT WAS SAID THAT NANCY'S SISTER WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS LUST BUT SHE RESISTED AND THE RESULT WAS THAT SHE WAS SOLD TO NEW ORLEANS
THEY WERE UNITED HEART AND HAND IN THE ONE GREAT PURPOSE TO REACH FREE LAND BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PURSUERS WERE ON THEIR TRACK
WILLIAM COMPLAINED THAT SWART WOULD COME HOME LATE AT NIGHT DRUNK AND IF HE DID NOT FIND US AWAKE HE WOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO WAKE US BUT WOULD BEGIN CUTTING AND SLASHING WITH A COWHIDE
THOU BEHELD'ST HIM IN THE TASK-FIELD IN THE PRISON SHADOW DIM AND THY MERCY TO THE BONDMAN IT WAS MERCY UNTO HIM I TRUST SOME ONE WELL QUALIFIED TO EXECUTE THE PLEASING TASK WILL WRITE HIS BIOGRAPHY FOR THE GRAND LESSONS HIS LIFE INCULCATED

THE WEBBS OF DUBLIN AND THE MISSES WIGHAMS OF SCOTLAND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE EDINBURGH LADIES EMANCIPATION SOCIETY WERE CONSTANTLY IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEADING ABOLITIONISTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY MANIFESTING A DEEP INTEREST IN THE GENERAL CAUSE AND WERE LIKEWISE SPECIAL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD OF PHILADELPHIA
FOR YEARS HE HAD BEEN THREATENING
HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF LEARNING TO READ OR WRITE BUT WITH HARD TREATMENT HE HAD BEEN MADE FULLY ACQUAINTED UNDER A MAN NAMED HENRY CAMPBELL WHO CALLED HIMSELF FRANK'S MASTER AND WITHOUT HIS CONSENT MANAGED TO PROFIT BY HIS DAILY SWEAT AND TOIL

A THIRTY YEARS APPRENTICESHIP AS A SLAVE HAD NOT HOWEVER WON HIM OVER TO THE LOVE OF THE SYSTEM
THANK GOD THAT I AM TREADING ON FREE SOIL
HE HAD BEEN MARRIED TWICE AND AT THE TIME OF HIS ESCAPE HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF TWO WIVES
HE HAS LIVED TO WITNESS THE TRIUMPH OF THE GREAT CAUSE TO WHICH HE DEVOTED HIS YOUTH AND HIS MANHOOD
AND I VENTURE TO SAY THAT IN TIME TO COME NEAR OR REMOTE I KNOW NOT HIS NAME WILL BECOME THE HERALD AND THE SYNONYM OF GOOD TO MILLIONS OF MEN WHO WILL DWELL ON THE NOW ALMOST UNKNOWN CONTINENT OF AFRICA

IN AN UPPER ROOM WITH A COMFORTABLE FIRE AND THE DOOR LOCKED SAT JOE STILL IN BOY'S CLOTHES TO BE ABLE TO ESCAPE AT THE FIRST INTIMATION OF DANGER BUT WITH A SMILE AND LOOK OF TOUCHING GRATITUDE WHENEVER ANY ONE OF THE FAMILY WHO WAS IN THE SECRET LEFT THE FESTIVE GROUP TO LOOK IN UPON THE INTERESTING STRANGER

WEEMS ARROW LETTER 187
STILL DEAR FRIEND:--IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO INFORM YOU THAT I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO REACH THIS NORTHERN CANAAN
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR MAY DIRECT THE TIME AND STATION FOR THE CRUISE OF EACH PILOT BOAT AND PERFORM SUCH OTHER DUTY AS THE GOVERNOR MAY DESIGNATE NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT
THE MAN THAT HE ESCAPED FROM WAS A FARMER BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM ROBERTS WHO ALSO OWNED SEVEN OTHER YOUNG SLAVES
WILLIAM HENRY WAS ALSO A FELLOW-PASSENGER ON THE SAME BOAT WITH WILLIAM B
IT WAS HOWEVER ONE OF THE MOST GRATIFYING FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE FUGITIVES THE STRONG LOVE AND ATTACHMENT THAT THEY CONSTANTLY EXPRESSED FOR THEIR RELATIVES LEFT IN THE SOUTH
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED THAT I HAVE NOT ANSWERED YOU BEFORE THIS BUT IT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF NOT KNOWING ANYTHING CONCERNING THE LETTER BEING IN THE POST-OFFICE UNTIL I WAS TOLD SO BY A FRIEND
THE VERY DAY HE ESCAPED HE HAD A SERIOUS COMBAT WITH TWO OF HIS MASTER'S SONS
HOW IS THIS MY WIFE IS IN THIS CAR SPAKE MILES
COMPARATIVELY THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE LIVES OF JERMAIN LOGAN AND OTHERS
HER SON HAVING GONE ON AHEAD TO CANADA ABOUT SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF HER SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD STRONG TIES IN THE GOODLY LAND
CONSEQUENTLY HE COMMUNICATED THE INTELLIGENCE TO HIS OWNER WHICH HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT ON HIS MIND AS APPEARED FROM HIS ANSWER TO THE OVERSEER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF HE SHOULD AGAIN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT WESLEY AND HE SHOULD REPEL THE WHOLESOME TREATMENT THE OVERSEER WAS TO PUT HIM IN PRISON AND SELL HIM
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING ALONG IN CANADA
ALTHOUGH HAVING TO ATTEND A BROTHER ILL WITH AN ATTACK OF APOPLEXY GARRETT TOOK TIME TO ATTEND TO THE INTEREST OF THE TWENTY-ONE AS THE ABOVE LETTER INDICATES
APPEARED AT HIS OFFICE WITH THE IDENTICAL LETTER IN HIS HAND THAT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED HIM BY MR W
HENCE GEORGE THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO TAKE WARNING
MISTRESS DRANK THAT WAS THE REASON SHE WAS SO DISAGREEABLE TOWNSEND HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN FOR ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS ONLY
HE REMAINED WITH WILLIAM WRIGHT UNTIL APRIL 1829
JOSIAH WAS TWENTY-THREE
PRICE 129
IN COMMON WITH STOCKHOLDERS AT HOME THESE TRANS-ATLANTIC INVESTORS WERE WILLING TO RECEIVE THEIR SHARES OF DIVIDENDS IN THE ANSWER OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE OR IN OTHER WORDS FROM THE SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE DERIVABLE FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING DONE WHAT THEY COULD TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERINGS OF THE OPPRESSED STRUGGLING TO BE FREE
HE HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO LEARN TO READ BUT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF HIS GAINING THE LIGHT
SHE HAD BEEN AT HER MISTRESS BECK AND CALL AS SEAMSTRESS DRESSING-MAID NURSE IN THE SICKROOM ETC ETC UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT APPEAR TO THE CASUAL OBSERVER UNCOMMONLY FAVORABLE FOR A SLAVE
THEREFORE FEELING HIS WRONGS KEENLY JACK DECIDED WITH HIS OTHER FRIENDS TO RUN OFF AND BE FREE
14 THE EXECUTIVE OF THIS STATE MAY APPOINT ONE OR MORE INSPECTORS FOR THE RAPPAHANNOCK AND POTOMAC RIVERS IF HE SHALL DEEM IT EXPEDIENT FOR THE DUE EXECUTION OF THIS ACT
I LEARN TO-DAY THAT THE CARRIAGE IN THAT COMPANY OWING TO FAST DRIVING WITH SUCH A HEAVY LOAD IS BADLY BROKEN AND THE POOR HORSE WAS BADLY INJURED
BELIEVING THAT COMPANY WAS DESIRABLE HE TOOK OCCASION TO SUBMIT HIS PLAN TO CERTAIN FRIENDS WHO WERE AT ONCE PLEASED WITH THE IDEA OF A TRIP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD TO CANADA ETC
MR GARRETT CONTINUED HIS INTEREST IN EVERY REFORM UP TO HIS LAST ILLNESS AND PROBABLY HIS LAST APPEARANCE IN ANY PUBLIC CAPACITY WAS AS PRESIDENT OF A WOMAN SUFFRAGE MEETING IN THE CITY HALL A FEW MONTHS AGO WHICH WAS ADDRESSED BY JULIA WARD HOWE LUCY STONE AND HENRY B
THINE C E.F
PETER PETTY WAS ABOUT TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND WORE A HAPPY COUNTENANCE
BUT THE DINNER HAD BEEN SO HANDSOMELY ARRANGED AND COMING FROM THE SOURCE THAT IT DID IT HAD A VERY TELLING EFFECT
WHILE THE VICTORY WAS A SOURCE OF GREAT MOMENTARY REJOICING ON THE PART OF THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE IT WAS NEVERTHELESS QUITE MANIFEST THAT SHE WAS ONLY RELEASED BY THE SKIN OF HER TEETH A SCAR ON HER FOREHEAD SAVED HER
WHEN YOU WRITE DIRECT YOO LETTERS MRS FLARECE P
DEAR SISTER I THANK YOU FOR THE BRAVE AND NOBLE WORDS THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN
ALFRED KING JIMMY ALLEN AND THOMAS BROCKSTON IN SPEAKING OF THEIR HABITS JACK SAID THAT THEY WERE VERY SMART WHEN THE MASTER WAS ABOUT BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE THEY WOULD INSTANTLY DROP BACK THEY WERE ALL MEAN BUT THE OLD BOSS WAS MEANER THAN THEM ALL AND THE OVERSEERS WERE FRAIDER OF HIM THAN WHAT I WAS SAID JACK
BUT LATER WHEN ABOLITIONISTS WERE MORE NUMEROUS AND EASIER STAGES COULD BE SAFELY MADE EITHER DIRECTLY TO THE WRITER OR TO ONE OR OTHER OF TEN OR TWELVE STATIONS WHICH HAD BECOME ESTABLISHED AT PLACES LESS REMOTE IN THE COUNTIES OF CHESTER AND MONTGOMERY
I AM RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR THE SOWING AND BRAVELY WENT THE SOWING ON WITH THE BROADCAST LARGESSE OF LOVE
IT WAS THEREFORE A NEVER-FAILING SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS TO BE THUS DEBARRED AND IT WAS WHOLLY ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT HE TOOK OUT AS HE DID AND AT THE TIME THAT HE DID

STRAIGHTWAY UPON FURTHER REFLECTION SEVERAL OTHER VERY SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES STARED THEM IN THE FACE
BEING NATURALLY PASSIONATE WHEN IN A BRUTAL MOOD HE MADE HIS SLAVES SUFFER UNMERCIFULLY
BUT AS HE HAD THE ASTHMA PRETTY BADLY AT THAT TIME HE WAS NOT SALEABLE THE TRADERS EVEN DECLINED TO BUY HIM
HE LOVED HIS SISTERS BUT HE KNEW IF HE COULD NOT PROTECT HIMSELF MUCH LESS COULD HE PROTECT THEM
HIS VOICE WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED
THE EXERCISE OF WOMEN'S TALENT IN THIS LINE AS WELL AS THE GENERAL CARE WHICH DEVOLVED UPON THEM IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR HUSBANDS TENDED TO DEVELOP THEIR INTELLECTUAL POWERS AND STRENGTHENED THEM MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THE FAMILY REMOVED TO BOSTON IN 1804
8 FOR EVERY INSPECTION OF A VESSEL UNDER THIS LAW THE INSPECTOR OR OTHER OFFICER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO DEMAND AND RECEIVE THE SUM OF FIVE DOLLARS

THESE RECORDS GREW ON HIS HANDS DURING THE YEARS HE ACTED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PHILADELPHIA BRANCH OF THAT CELEBRATED CORPORATION UNTIL THEY REACHED THE EXTENT OF THE PRESENT VOLUME
A THIRD TIME HE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WHERE HE REMAINED ONLY TWO DAYS
HIS MOTHER WAS OWNED BY MASSEY BUT HIS FATHER BELONGED TO THE SUPERIOR RACE OR CLAIMED SO TO DO AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE PROVED BY APPEARANCES IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS THE SON OF A WHITE MAN
THEY CAME FROM LOUDOUN AND FAUQUIER COUNTIES
THE WILL OF HENRY'S OLD MASTER ENTITLED HIM TO HIS FREEDOM BUT THE HEIRS HAD RENDERED SAID WILL NULL AND VOID

AGE TWENTY-TWO YEARS
COLBURN
TWO MEN FROM NEAR CHESTERTOWN MD
HE HAD HOWEVER BEEN IN THEIR CLUTCHES ONLY A SHORT WHILE BEFORE ESCAPING BUT THAT SHORT WHILE SEEMED ALMOST AN AGE AS HE WAS TREATED SO MEANLY BY THEM COMPARED WITH THE TREATMENT WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED UNDER HIS FORMER MASTER
BUT TO ROUGH USAGE HE WAS NO STRANGER
RINGOLD CHAS
THERE IS PROGRESS IN TENNESSEE AND EVEN IN THIS STATE WHILE A NUMBER HAVE BEEN LEAVING SOME WHO STAY SEEM TO BE GETTING ALONG PROSPEROUSLY
THAT SYSTEM WHICH COULD NOT LIVE A DAY IF IT DID NOT GIVE ONE PARTY SUPREME CONTROL OVER THE PERSONS THE HEALTH THE LIBERTY THE HAPPINESS THE MARRIAGE RELATIONS THE PARENTAL AUTHORITY AND FILIAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE OTHER;--IF YOU CHOOSE TO CLING TO SUCH A SYSTEM CLING TO IT

NOTWITHSTANDING THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE SLAVE POWER--THE CHURCH THE STATE ALL PARTIES ALL DENOMINATIONS READY TO DO ITS BIDDING
THEY ARRIVED AT PERRYVILLE BEFORE THE TRAIN FOR BALTIMORE
I FREQUENTLY SAW THIS MASTER OF MOLLY'S AND WAS ALWAYS TREATED RESPECTFULLY BY HIM
PENN HE WAS WORTHY OF IT AS IN THE CASE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER
IT WAS OWING TO THE BAD TREATMENT OF PUMPHREY THAT GUSTA LEFT IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID
SHE HAD SONS BUT THEY TURNED OUT TO BE DRUNKARDS AND FOLLOWED NO BUSINESS
THE AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS THE AUTHORITIES OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND MARYLAND WERE DILIGENTLY MAKING ARRESTS WHEREVER A SUSPECTED PARTY COULD BE FOUND WHO HAPPENED TO BELONG IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CHRISTIANA
BUT SHE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK AND SHE WELL UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT MEANT
PERSONAL ABUSE AND HARD USAGE WERE THE COMMON LOT OF POOR SLAVE GIRLS
IN THIS WAY HE REACHED CITY POINT
CLIFTON HOUSE NIAGARA FALLS AUGUST THE 27
I THINK HE WAS ONE OF THE REMARKABLE MEN OF THE TIMES IN FAITH IN HOLY BOLDNESS IN FEARLESS DEVOTION TO THE RIGHT IN UNCOMPROMISING INTEGRITY IN UNSELFISH BENEVOLENCE IN LOVE TO GOD AND MAN AND IN UNCEASING LIFE-LONG EFFORTS TO DO JUSTLY TO LOVE MERCY AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH GOD

LET US STAND AT OUR POST AND WAIT GOD'S TIME
MEN WOMEN OR CHILDREN SEEKING TO BE UNLOOSED FROM THE FETTERS OF SLAVERY COULD NOT MAKE THEIR GRIEVANCES KNOWN TO JOHN HUNN WITHOUT CALLING FORTH HIS WARMEST SYMPATHIES
HE HAD THE NAME OF HAVING A WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN BUT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF DELAWARE HE ONLY HAD A NOMINAL RIGHT IN THEM
TIMES WITH JOHN HAD NOT BEEN VERY ROUGH UNTIL WITHIN THE LAST YEAR OF HIS BONDAGE
EVEN AS EARLY AS NOVEMBER THE YOUNG DESPOT HAD DISTINCTLY GIVEN JOE TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE HIRED OUT ANOTHER YEAR INTIMATING THAT HE WAS TO GO SOMEWHERE BUT AS TO PARTICULARS IT WAS TIME ENOUGH FOR JOE TO KNOW THEM
IT WAS HARD FOR THOSE WHO SAW HIS RUDDY CHEEK AND SPARKLING EYE HIS SOFT BROWN HAIR AND SPRIGHTLY MOVEMENTS TO FEEL THAT THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS DRAWING NIGH
SOMETIMES HOWEVER THIS RULE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER BE CONFORMED TO

UNWAVERING IN THE TRUTH'S DEFENCE E'EN WHERE THE FIRES OF HATE ARE BURNING THE UNQUAILING EYE OF INNOCENCE ALONE UPON THE OPPRESSOR TURNING
PLEASE REMEMBER ME TO THEM ALL
I HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT IF THE VIEWS I HAVE EXPRESSED ARE IN ANY RESPECT ERRONEOUS THEY MUST UNDERGO THE REVISION OF MY LEARNED BROTHER OF THE SUPREME COURT WHO PRESIDES IN THIS CIRCUIT BEFORE THEY CAN OPERATE TO THE SERIOUS PREJUDICE OF ANY ONE
BUT HE HAD STILL DEEPER THINKING TO DO YET
JIM'S HOUR HAD COME
AT THE TIME HOWEVER HE WAS PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SOME FAVORS SHOWN HIM;--COULD MAKE OVER-WORK AND EARN A LITTLE MONEY AND ONCE OR TWICE IN THE YEAR HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING VISITS TO HER

I SHALL HAVE TWO MEN SENT THIS EVENING SOME FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THIS TOWN AND SEND THEM IF FOUND TO CHESTER COUNTY THEE MAY SHOW THIS TO STILL AND MCKIM AND OBLIGE THY COUSIN THOMAS GARRETT
FOR A LONG TIME WILLIAM HAD CHERISHED A STRONG DESIRE TO BE FREE AND HAD GONE SO FAR ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AS TO MAKE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS END
FOR TWO YEARS THE FEAR OF BEING SOLD HAD NOT BEEN OUT OF HIS MIND
WE ANTICIPATE FOR IT A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A PERMANENT RANK IN A PECULIAR AND PAINFUL DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY
DO I UNDERSTAND HIM TO SAY WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO DETERMINE THIS MATTER JUDICIALLY
IN FAVOR OF THAT MOST DEVILISH DELUSION THAT SLAVERY WAS A DIVINE INSTITUTION
LOUD CHEERS WE NOW WELCOME HIM AMONGST US AS A FRIEND WHOM SOME OF US HAVE KNOWN LONG
BLOOD FLOWED FREELY
AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS HE WAS BOUND AN APPRENTICE AS WAS THE GOOD CUSTOM OF THE DAY TO A FRIEND IN LANCASTER COUNTY TO LEARN THE TANNING BUSINESS
SHALL WE NOT WASH YOUR BACK AND NECK FOR YOU
THE MEN RAN AROUND THE BARN AND SEIZED HIM
FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN YOU COMMENCED YOUR EFFORTS SLAVERY APPEARED TO BE RAPIDLY ADVANCING TO COMPLETE ASCENDENCY IN AMERICA
AS SHE HAD FORMED A VERY HIGH OPINION OF BOSTON FROM HAVING HEARD IT SO THOROUGHLY REVILED IN NORFOLK SHE DESIRED TO GO THERE
MY HEART LEAPED FOR JOY AT SEEING THESE RESCUED ONES
AND YET HOW HAVE OUR PEOPLE BEEN MURDERED IN THE SOUTH AND THEIR BONES SCATTERED AT THE GRAVE'S MOUTH
THE JOYFUL ANTICIPATIONS WHICH NOW FILLED HIS BREAST LEFT NO ROOM FOR FEAR

STEPHEN'S PARENTS WERE DEAD
HAINES FRANCIS 168
HOW SKILFUL AND ADROIT HE WAS IN ELUDING THE HUNTERS
OR PERHAPS THE APPALLING NATURE OF HIS SUFFERINGS RENDERED THE PEN POWERLESS AND MADE THE HEART TOO SICK FOR THE TASK
MANY OF THESE POPULAR ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADVERTISEMENTS WERE PRESERVED MANY OTHERS WERE SENT AWAY TO FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE WHO TOOK A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE U.G.R.R
IF I HAD NOT CONVERSED WITH HER DURING THE TWENTY-ONE YEARS I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HER
THAT HE WOULD FIND AS MANY POOR MISERABLY DEGRADED OF HIS OWN COLOR DOWN-TOWN AS AMONG THE DEGRADED BLACKS

ON THE 23D OF MAY 1864 DEATH DEPRIVED HER OF HER HUSBAND
WILLIAM TRIPLETT AND THOMAS HARPER
IN DUE TIME THE AGREEMENT WAS CARRIED INTO EFFECT AND ALL ARRIVED SAFELY AND WERE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE IN PHILADELPHIA
FOR YEARS THEY HAD EVEN OCCUPIED THE SAME ROOM,--HENRY AS A SERVANT-BOY AND PROTECTOR OF HIS PROSPECTIVE YOUNG MASTER
MRS MOTT WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO RESUME TEACHING
THE REMAINDER OF HIS DAYS HE FELT BOUND TO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HIMSELF
SOME OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS HAVE CAUSE TO CENSURE ME
NOW IN TERROR LEST THE HUMAN BLOOD-HOUNDS SHOULD BE AT THEIR HEELS I FELT AS THOUGH I COULD LAY DOWN MY LIFE IN THE CAUSE OF THE OPPRESSED
DURING HIS FATHER'S RESIDENCE IN WILMINGTON HE SPENT HIS SUMMERS WITH KINSMEN IN LANCASTER COUNTY LEARNING TO BE A FARMER AND HIS WINTERS IN WILMINGTON GOING TO SCHOOL
AFTER HAVING RECEIVED MANY TOKENS OF ESTEEM AND KINDNESS FROM THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE IN NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN SHE WAS CAREFULLY FORWARDED ON TO CANADA TO BE EDUCATED AT THE BUXTON SETTLEMENT AN INTERESTING LETTER HOWEVER FROM THE MOTHER OF ANN MARIA CONVEYING THE INTELLIGENCE OF HER LATE GREAT STRUGGLE AND ANXIETY IN LABORING TO FREE HER LAST CHILD FROM SLAVERY IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE OMITTED AND HENCE IS INSERTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NARRATIVE
SHE WAS THEN A SMALL PERSON
SPENCER JOHN 204
SHE HOWEVER WAS IN THE HABIT OF HIRING OUT TO REAP A GREATER REVENUE FOR THEM AND DID NOT ALWAYS GET THEM PLACES WHERE THEY WERE TREATED AS WELL AS SHE HERSELF TREATED THEM
THE PRO-SLAVERY SIDE DESIRED NONE BUT SUCH AS BELIEVED IN THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW AND IN TREASON AS EXPOUNDED IN THE JUDGE'S CHARGE AND THE FINDING OF THE GRAND JURY
THE HORSES WERE EASILY CAPTURED AT THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE LEFT BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE MUTE AS TO WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEIR DRIVERS
AND EVEN NOW THE SCALE MAY STILL SEEM TO OSCILLATE BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES AND SOME MAY SAY WHY DOES NOT GOD GIVE US FULL AND QUICK VICTORY
SHE DETERMINED NOT TO REMAIN EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF HER HUSBAND WHO WAS A SLAVE
THEIR SUFFERINGS AT BEST WERE FEARFUL
NONE BUT AMERICANS
INDEED AS SHE THEN APPEARED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY-THREE A FINE FRESH AND HEALTHY-LOOKING MULATTO WOMAN NINE OUT OF EVERY TEN WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SUBJECTED TO HARD TREATMENT
MRS DR
MRS DR
ALSO HER BOX WILL BE LOOKED AFTER
WITH HER NEWLY ACQUIRED REPUTATION AS A LECTURER FROM 1856 TO 1859 SHE CONTINUED HER LABORS IN PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY NEW YORK OHIO C
THE VERY IDEA OF HAVING TO WALK FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS IN SUCCESSION OVER STRANGE ROADS THROUGH BY-WAYS AND VALLEYS OVER MOUNTAINS AND MARSHES WAS FITTED TO APPAL THE BRAVEST HEARTS ESPECIALLY WHERE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE CONCERNED
THEN AGAIN SOME DIDN'T LIKE HIM HE WAS A MEAN MAN ALL FOR HIMSELF
I'D RATHER HELP THEM OFF
GEORGE UPSHER.--THE THIRD IN THIS ARRIVAL WAS ALSO A FULL MAN
SHE HAD A MOTHER LIVING IN NEW CASTLE NAMED ANN ELIZA KINGSLOW
AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THE STORY ALL THAT THE WRITER HAS TO SAY IS THAT HE TOOK IT DOWN FROM THE LIPS OF CHARLES HURRIEDLY DIRECTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WITH NO THOUGHT OF MAGNIFYING A SINGLE INCIDENT
BEING A MAN OF COMMANDING PRESENCE AND GREAT ENERGY AND DETERMINATION EFFORTS WERE MADE DURING THE REVOLUTION TO INDUCE HIM TO ENLIST AS A CAVALRY SOLDIER

FOOD AND CLOTHING FOR THIS LARGE NUMBER WERE DEALT OUT VERY STINTEDLY AND DAILY SUFFERING WAS THE COMMON LOT OF SLAVES UNDER LLOYD
OF COURSE THEY HAD HEARD AS MOST SLAVES HAD OF CAVE LIFE AND PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD ALL THE MEASURES WHICH HAD TO BE RESORTED TO FOR SECURITY WHEN ENTERING UPON SO HAZARDOUS AN UNDERTAKING
COMMISSIONER GUTHRIE AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE IT WILL BE A FAIR ONE

DURING NINE YEARS THAT I LIVED IN HIS HOUSEHOLD MY RESPECT AND AFFECTION FOR HIM CONTINUALLY INCREASED
JANE DID NOT KNOW HOW OLD SHE WAS
THAT HOWEVER HAPPILY HE MIGHT BE SITUATED IN FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE THE PAINFUL REFLECTION EVER PRESENT WITH HIM THAT THOSE HE MOST LOVED IN THIS WORLD WERE SLAVES--"KNOCKED AND BEAT ABOUT--AND MADE TO WORK OUT IN ALL WEATHERS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE MANY FALTER AND GIVE UP THEIR PURPOSE TO GAIN THEIR FREEDOM BY FLIGHT BUT RANDOLPH WAS NOT ONE OF THIS CLASS

SO WHEN THE TIME WAS UP FOR THE PAYMENT TO BE MADE THE DR WAS NOT PREPARED
HIS STORY CONTAINED NOTHING OF MARKED IMPORTANCE
OFTEN QUOTING FROM SOME ONE WHO SAID THAT THE ADORNMENT OF A VAIN AND FOOLISH WORLD WOULD FEED A STARVING ONE HE OPPOSED EXTRAVAGANT FASHIONS AND ALL LUXURY OF HABIT AND LIFE AS CALCULATED TO PRODUCE EFFEMINACY AND DEGRADING SENSUALITY AND AS A BESTOWAL OF IDOLATROUS ATTENTION UPON THAT BODY WHICH HE WOULD OFTEN SAY WAS HERE BUT FOR A SHORT TIME LOOKING ONLY UPON THAT AS RELIGION WHICH MADE MEN LOVE EACH OTHER AND DO GOOD TO EACH OTHER IN THIS WORLD HE WAS LITTLE OF A STICKLER FOR POINTS OF BELIEF AND EVEN WHEN HE DID LOOK INTO THEOLOGICAL MATTERS OR DENOUNCE A MAN'S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS IT WAS GENERALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE CALCULATED TO DARKEN THE MIND AND BE ENTERTAINED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR GOOD WORKS

HIS HOUSE AS WELL AS HIS PURSE WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO THE SLAVE

HIS FATHER THOUGH A FARMER HAD BEEN A SCYTHE AND EDGE-TOOL MAKER AND THOMAS LEARNED OF HIM THE TRADE AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF IT AFTERWARDS PROVED OF THE UTMOST ADVANTAGE TO HIM
LATTERLY HE HAD BEEN TALKING OF MOVING INTO THE STATE OF VIRGINIA

AND HE ADVISED US TO HIDE AS QUICKLY AS WE COULD
FOR A LONG TIME HE WAS ENDURED RATHER THAN ENDORSED AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN SUCH ANTI-SLAVERY FEELINGS AS HE CHERISHED BECAME GENERALLY DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE SOCIETY THAT HE FOUND THE UNITY HE DESIRED AND EXPECTED

THAT THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SUPERIOR COURTS OF EACH ORGANIZED TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL FROM TIME TO TIME ENLARGE THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS WITH A VIEW TO AFFORD REASONABLE FACILITIES TO RECLAIM FUGITIVES FROM LABOR AND TO THE PROMPT DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES IMPOSED BY THIS ACT
THIS WAS MY INTENTION ALL THE WHILE
BOY OR OF ANY SUBSTITUTE AND SEEMED TO WANT NO PARTICULAR INFORMATION FROM ME CONCERNING MY ANXIETIES AND PERILS THOUGH I STATED THEM TO HIM BUT FOUND HIM AS POWERLESS AS MYSELF TO GIVE ME RELIEF
CRUEL INDEED DID HE FIND IT THERE
EVIDENTLY HIS INTELLECT HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED BY WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED UNDER HIS TASK-MASTER
AFTER THIS STATEMENT THE JUDGE POSTPONED FURTHER ACTION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY
HE KNEW OF NO OTHER WAY OF ESCAPE THAN THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
DESIRING TO SPEAK TO WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN THE OBJECTS OF SO MUCH WRONG AND ABUSE UNDER SLAVERY AND EVEN SINCE EMANCIPATION IN A STATE OF IGNORANCE NOT ACCESSIBLE ALWAYS TO THOSE WHO WOULD OR COULD URGE THE PROPER KIND OF EDUCATION RESPECTING THEIR MORALS AND GENERAL IMPROVEMENT MRS HARPER HAS MADE IT HER BUSINESS NOT TO OVERLOOK THIS ALL IMPORTANT DUTY TO HER POOR SISTERS
ALSO I HAVE NO COMPASSION ON THE PENNILESS WIDOW LADY I HAVE SERVED HER 25 YERS 2 MONTHS I THINK THAT IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO LIVE A SLAVE
8 O'CLOCK P.M
ON THURSDAY NIGHTS WHEN HE WOULD NOT WANT THE SERVANTS TO GO INTO TOWN TO MEETING HE WOULD KEEP UP UNTIL IT WOULD BE TOO LATE FOR THEM TO GO
I HAVE NOT THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTED TO ME
HE WAS AN OLD MAN BUT A VERY WICKED MAN AND DRANK VERY HARD GEORGE HAD BEEN TAUGHT FIELD WORK PRETTY THOROUGHLY BUT NOTHING IN THE WAY OF READING AND WRITING
ROBINSON WM 223
HE WAS TWENTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE OF A LIGHT BROWN COLOR WELL-MADE
HE HAD BEEN SOLD ONCE AND BROUGHT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE FOLLOWING IS A COPY OF THE INDICTMENT
A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME FROM WILMINGTON YESTERDAY ASSURES US THAT THE CASE IS IN GOOD HANDS AT NEWCASTLE
THE POST-OFFICE IS SHUT SO I ENCLOSE THE MONEY TO PAY THE POST AND PLEASE WRITE ME IN HASTE
BUT TO THE COLORED PEOPLE THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS DEATH WAS AT ONCE STARTLING AND CONFOUNDING
ON CROSS-EXAMINATION HE SWORE THUS
THIS INTELLIGENCE AROUSED THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO BE SCANTILY FED AND CLOTHED AND COMPELLED TO WORK WITHOUT HIRE GEORGE DID NOT ADMIRE BUT HAD TO SUBMIT WITHOUT MURMURING
AS HE DREW NEAR THEY WERE ABOUT COMING OUT TO MEET THEIR ASSAILANTS HIGHLY EXCITED BY CONTINUED OUTRAGES AND DETERMINED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES OR DIE
I AT ONCE WAS CONVINCED HE WISHED TO KNOW SO AS TO HAVE THEM ARRESTED AND TAKEN BACK
THUS CONSIDERING HIMSELF IN DANGER HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE TIME HAD COME FOR HIM TO CHANGE HIS HABITATION SO HE RESOLVED TO TRY HIS FORTUNE ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
PERRY BURTON.--PERRY IS ABOUT TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE DECIDEDLY COLORED MEDIUM SIZE AND ONLY OF ORDINARY INTELLECT
HE CONCEIVED THAT IF HE COULD SUCCEED IN GAINING HIS FREEDOM HE MIGHT POSSIBLY AID THEM AWAY ALSO
IN THIS MATTER THE COMMITTEE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO INTERFERE DIRECTLY IN ANY WAY FURTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING WAS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO
I AM LOOKING FOR MY WIFE EVERY DAY
I HOPE YOU WILL PUBLISH SO THAT MR WILLIAMSON MAY KNOW THAT MEN ARE NOT CHATTEL HERE BUT REATHER THEY ARE MEN AND IF HE WANTS HIS CHATTLE LET HIM COME HERE AFTER IT OR HIS THING
I WANT YOU ALL TO COME TO THIS LAND OF LIBERTY WHERE THE BONDMAN CAN BE FREE
WHEN HE DIED THE CONTRARY WAS FOUND TO BE THE FACT
HEIGHT ABOUT SIX FEET
HIS ENLARGED SYMPATHIES HAD ALWAYS EMBRACED THE CRIMINAL AND THE IMPRISONED AS WELL AS THE OPPRESSED
HOGGISHNESS ACCORDING TO PASCAL'S PHRASEOLOGY WAS THE MOST PREDOMINANT TRAIT IN THE CHARACTER OF HIS NEW MASTERS
BROOKS MRS DR 590
THE MAN AND WOMAN STOPPED AT THE DEPOT AND WENT EAST ON THE NEXT TRAIN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES AND DID NOT GET BACK TILL TO-NIGHT SO THAT THE TWO MEN WENT THIS MORNING AND THE FOUR WENT THIS EVENING
WITHOUT ANY EFFORT AT ATTENTIVE LISTENING WE FOLLOWED THE SPEAKER TO THE END NOT DISCERNING A SINGLE GRAMMATICAL INACCURACY OF SPEECH OR THE SLIGHTEST VIOLATION OF GOOD TASTE IN MANNER OR MATTER
HOTEL IN ORDER TO KIDNAP HIM
ROBERT PURVIS
CHAS
CHAS
OR OF KNOCKING HIM AND STAMPING HIS HEAD WITH THE HEELS OF HIS BOOTS REPEATEDLY OF LATE HE HAD BEEN SHOCKINGLY BEATEN
THE IDEA THAT HE MUST WORK AND BE SOLD AT THE PLEASURE OF ANOTHER MADE HIM DECIDE TO PULL UP STAKES AND SEEK REFUGE ELSEWHERE
HARRIET MAYO JOHN JUDAH AND RICHARD BRADLEY PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND
JACK HAD ONCE HAD A WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN BUT AS THEY BELONGED TO A SLAVE-HOLDER JIM PRICE JACK'S RIGHTS WERE WHOLLY IGNORED AND HE LOST THEM
IF SO WE SHALL PUBLISH IT WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
SHE WAS LAME FOR TWENTY YEARS AND COULDN'T WALK A STEP WITHOUT CRUTCHES AND I WAS HER MAIN SUPPORT
SKINNER NEITHER SOLD NOR EMANCIPATED A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE VINCENT ESCAPED HIS MASTER WAS CALLED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS STEWARDSHIP AND THERE IN THE SPIRIT LAND VINCENT WAS WILLING TO LET HIM REMAIN WITHOUT MUCH MORE TO ADD ABOUT HIM
BUT THE WINDS OF HEAVEN OWNED TO NO DECOROUS LIMIT IN MASON AND DIXON'S LINE
HENCE THERE ARE MANY MORE WHO MOURN HIS LOSS AS WELL AS YOURSELVES
HE SELLS SOMETIMES AND HE HIRED OUT A GREAT MANY
THE COLORED MAN REPLIED YOU HAD BETTER GO AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HURT AND AT THE SAME TIME PUSHED HIM ASIDE AND PASSED OUT
NO CHANGE PARDON OR RELIEF COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE SPIRIT AND POWER THAT HELD SWAY OVER DELAWARE AT THAT TIME

JACKSON PETER ALIAS STAUNCH TILGHMAN 296
JERRY WILLIAMS LOVE TOGETHER WITH ALL OF US
SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT STRENGTHENS ME IN THE BELIEF THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS ABROAD IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE MOVING THEM TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE POOR SUBJECTED SLAVE I HAVE THE PROMISE OF ABLER PENS TO AID ME WHEN I GET STARTED AGAIN
HE TOLD US TO SEND THEM TO HIM BUT DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING TO
WHEN SHE RAN AWAY I PROCEEDED AFTER HER
FEE'S DAUGHTER IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE ONE DESERVES IT FROM HER NOBLE DARING THE OTHER AS A LITTLE TRIBUTE TO HER FATHER'S VIRTUES
DID I WANT TO BE A SLAVE

HE WAS A MAN IN HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES TRYING TO INCREASE HIS SMALL FORTUNE BY SLAVE-LABOR
THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM UNCOMMONLY INTELLIGENT NEGROES
THIS HERO ESCAPED FROM MARTINSBURG VA IN 1856
SHE HAD BEEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO FIELD LABOR THAN HOUSE-WORK
HIS FATHER'S NAME WAS EPHRAIM HIS MOTHER'S NAME MAHALA
I WAS DOING A PROSPEROUS BUSINESS AT THAT TIME AND FELT IT MY DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE LIBERALLY OUT OF MY EARNINGS
NO ONE SUSPECTED THEM THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF WHILE PASSING THROUGH VIRGINIA
THIS CHATTEL WAS OWNED BY DR RICHARD DORSEY OF CAMBRIDGE MARYLAND
DEBORAH ANN BOYER SWORN
JAMES THOUGHT THAT THE DOCTRINE WAS INFAMOUS AND THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO LIVE WITH SUCH A MAN AS HIS MASTER
I AM IN CANADA AND THEY CANNOT HELP THEMSELVES
A REWARD OF $200 WAS ADVERTISED FOR HIS CAPTURE
WHITE MRS L.E 56
IT WAS QUITE EASY THEREFORE LOOKING AT THEIR CONDITION IN THE LIGHT OF THESE PLAIN FACTS FOR BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE TO AGREE THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE THEIR CONDITION ANY WORSE EVEN IF THEY SHOULD BE CAPTURED IN ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE
THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND PRESSURE ON ELLEN'S NERVES HOWEVER HAD TRIED HER SEVERELY SO MUCH SO THAT FOR DAYS AFTERWARDS SHE WAS PHYSICALLY VERY MUCH PROSTRATED ALTHOUGH JOY AND GLADNESS BEAMED FROM HER EYES WHICH BESPOKE INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT WITHIN
FIRST ON THIS RECORD WAS A YOUNG MULATTO WOMAN TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF AGE--ORANGE COLOR WHO COULD READ AND WRITE VERY WELL AND WAS UNUSUALLY INTELLIGENT AND WITHAL QUITE HANDSOME
OSCAR D
PERHAPS THEY WILL THINK THAT I DWELT UPON THE PAST TOO MUCH
SHE WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF
THE NIGHT WE LEFT HE HAD A WOMAN TIED UP--GOD KNOWS WHAT HE DONE
WE MUST DO THE BES WE CAN THER IS MUCH BISNESS DUN ON THIS ROAD
IN HIS CALM MANNER HE HANDED IT TO THE WRITER AT THE SAME TIME REMARKING THAT PASSMORE HAD GONE TO HARRISBURG AND ADDED THEE HAD BETTER ATTEND TO IT THE WRIT EDWARD HOPPER ESQ WAS APPLIED TO WITH THE WRIT AND IN THE ABSENCE OF MR WILLIAMSON APPEARED BEFORE THE COURT AND STATED THAT THE WRIT HAD NOT BEEN SERVED AS MR W

THE CAPTAIN LAUGHED AT THEM AND SIGNIFIED THAT THEY WERE PERFECTLY WELCOME TO SEARCH TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT
BUT AFTER BEING TWO DAYS ON THE JOURNEY THEY WERE ROUTED AND SEPARATED BY THEIR PURSUERS
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT MONEYLESS AS I AM
NELSON U.G.R.R
ONE BLACK SHAWL 4 50 CENTS
AS HE LOOKED CALMLY BACK UPON THE PAST AND SAW HOW HE AND THE REST OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR JUST RIGHTS HE COULD HARDLY REALIZE HOW PROVIDENCE COULD SUFFER SLAVE-HOLDERS TO DO AS THEY HAD BEEN DOING IN TRAMPLING UPON THE POOR AND HELPLESS SLAVES
SHE MADE MANY CONVERTS WHO WENT FORTH TO SPREAD THE GREAT IDEAS OF FREEDOM THROUGHOUT THE LAND
SO ONE SATURDAY NIGHT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK WE SET OUT FOR THE NORTH
IN THIS INSTANCE MR HENRY THE HARSH OWNER WAS EXASPERATED AND THE MILD ONE'S PATIENCE SO EXHAUSTED THAT THEY CONCLUDED THAT NOTHING SHORT OF STERN MEASURES WOULD CAUSE JOE TO REFORM
HE FLOGGED RICHMOND FOR NOT PLOUGHING THE CORN GOOD THAT WAS WHAT HE PRETENDED TO WHIP HIM FOR
JOHN THOMPSON SYRACUSE JENY 6TH
HE WAS NOT CRUEL BUT WAS VERY DRIVING AND ABUSIVE IN HIS LANGUAGE TOWARDS COLORED PEOPLE
HER ARRIVAL IN CANADA WAS ANNOUNCED BY REV
LEWIS CHILDS RICHMOND DANIEL BENNETT ALIAS HENRY WASHINGTON AND WIFE MARTHA AND TWO CHILDREN GEORGE AND A NAMELESS BABE THE ROAD AT THIS TIME WAS DOING A FAIR BUSINESS IN A QUIET WAY
I TAKE PLEASURE IN STATING THAT ACCORDING TO THE LETTER HE CONCKLIN WROTE TO MR D
MR ZACHARIAH BERRY WHO MANIFESTED SO MUCH INTEREST IN JIM MAY BE UNTIL THIS HOUR IN IGNORANCE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS RUNNING OFF WITHOUT ASKING LEAVE ETC
HE REPORTED THAT HE HAD HAD TROUBLE WITH A MAN KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THOMAS W.M
THEY STOPPED AT A FIRST-CLASS HOTEL IN CHARLESTON WHERE THE YOUNG PLANTER AND HIS BODY SERVANT WERE TREATED AS THE HOUSE WAS WONT TO TREAT THE CHIVALRY
MY JOY ON THIS OCCASION WAS GREAT
ONE BROTHER WAS THE ONLY NEAR RELATIVE HE LEFT IN CHAINS
WELL I SHALL WANT YOU TO START FOR PHILADELPHIA ON MONDAY MORNING
MR STILL HAS ASKED ME TO RECORD THE PART THAT MY FATHER BORE IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY ENTERPRISE AS IT BEGAN AND GREW IN THIS CITY
MR STILL I CANNOT RETURN YOU THE THANKS FOR THE CARE OF MY WIFE FOR I AM SO GLAD THAT I DON'T NOW WHAT TO SAY YOU WILL PLEAS START HER FOR CANADAY
AFTER ARRIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EREILDOUN PA HE WAS INDUCED TO TARRY AWHILE FOR THE PURPOSE OF EARNING MEANS TO CARRY HIM STILL FARTHER
THE OBEDIENT AND SUBMISSIVE SLAVE IS ALWAYS RECOGNIZED BY HANGING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING ON THE GROUND WHEN LOOKED AT BY A SLAVE-HOLDER
SHORTLY AFTER THREE O'CLOCK THE FUNERAL PROCESSION STARTED THE PLAIN COFFIN CONTAINING THE REMAINS BEING CARRIED BY THE STALWART ARMS OF A DELEGATION OF COLORED MEN AND THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED FOLLOWING IN CARRIAGES WITH A LARGE PROCESSION ON FOOT WHILE THE SIDEWALKS ALONG THE LINE FROM THE HOUSE TO THE MEETING-HOUSE MORE THAN SIX SQUARES WERE DENSELY CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS
POSEY AND JOSEPH P
THEY REPAIRED IN LARGE NUMBERS TO THE HOUSE OF THEIR BENEFACTOR TO OBTAIN A LAST GLANCE AT HIS LIFELESS BODY
C.L
ACCORDING TO REBECCA'S IDEA SHE WAS A PEEVISH FRETFUL ILL-NATURED BUT KIND-HEARTED CREATURE BEING VERY TIRED OF HER OLD MISTRESS AND HEARTILY SICK OF BONDAGE AND WITHAL DESIRING TO SAVE HER DAUGHTER SHE ASCERTAINED THE DOINGS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD,--WAS TOLD ABOUT CANADA C
104
FRANCIS HARKINS WAS THE NAME OF THE MASTER
THESE PASSENGERS AVERAGED ABOUT SIX FEET AND WERE OF UNCOMMONLY WELL-DEVELOPED PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
IN THE BRIEF SKETCHES GIVEN IN THIS CHAPTER SOME LOST ONES SEEKING INFORMATION OF RELATIVES MAY FIND COMFORT EVEN IF THE GENERAL READER SHOULD FAIL TO BE INTERESTED
ONE TIME A SNAKE COME TO THE TREE POKED ITS HEAD IN THE HOLLOW AND WAS COMING IN AND I TOOK MY AXE AND CHOPPED HIM IN TWO
HOWEVER I LIVED THROUGH IT AND GAVE THEM MORE GOSPEL TRUTH THAN PERHAPS SOME OF THEM HAVE HEARD FOR SOME TIME
I THINK SHE WORKED FOR MRS AMOS
147 AMERICAN HOTEL
147 AMERICAN HOTEL
THIS POSITIVE TESTIMONY SATISFIED THE JURY AND THE RAIL ROAD COMPANY AND POOR JAMES ADAMS ESCAPED BY THE VERDICT NOT GUILTY
THE SUBJOINED LETTER TO HIS WIFE SHOWS HOW DEEPLY HE WAS ATTACHED TO HER AND AT THE SAME TIME WHAT HIS VIEWS WERE OF SLAVERY
HARRIET WAS A BRIGHT MULATTO WITH MARKED FEATURES OF CHARACTER AND WELL MADE WITH GOOD ADDRESS AND QUITE INTELLIGENT
EVERY STEP THEY TOOK TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR FETTERS OR TO GAIN EDUCATION OR IN PLEADING THE CAUSE OF THEIR FELLOW-BONDMEN IN THE LECTURE-ROOM OR WITH THEIR PENS MET WITH APPLAUSE ON EVERY HAND AND THE VERY ARGUMENT NEEDED WAS THUS FURNISHED IN LARGE MEASURE
SHE WAS A CROSS WOMAN AND AS MUCH OF A BOSS AS HE WAS SHE WOULD TAKE A CLUB AND WITH BOTH HANDS WOULD WHACK AWAY AS LONG AS YOU WOULD STAND IT SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN
ON THESE OCCASIONS SHE WAS REQUIRED TO RISE EARLY ENOUGH TO MILK THE COWS GET BREAKFAST AND FEED THE HOGS BEFORE SUNRISE SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE AT HER DAY'S WASHING IN GOOD TIME
I GOT HERE YESTERDAY AND AM IN GOOD HEALTH AND HAPPY IN THE ENJOYMENT OF FREEDOM BUT AM VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE MY WIFE AND CHILD HERE WITH ME
HE ALWAYS KEPT POSTED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND ANTI-SLAVERY QUESTIONS
THUS WHILE THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA ESPECIALLY NEITHER CHARGED NOR ACCEPTED ANYTHING FOR THEIR SERVICES IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT ANY OF THE SOUTHERN AGENTS COULD AFFORD TO DO LIKEWISE
SHE WISHES TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE HEARD FROM MR BIGLOW OF WASHINGTON CITY
WASHINGTON
LIKE THE MEANEST CURS THEY HAD TO SNEAK THROUGH THE CRYSTAL PALACE UNNOTICED AND UNCARED FOR
THAT HE HAD BEEN BOUGHT WITH ABOLITION GOLD TO SAVE HIM FROM GOING SOUTH
SHE HAD HOWEVER BELONGED TO THE MORE FAVORED CLASS OF SLAVES
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT COMES HERE DOES WELL
WE SHALL NOT SOON LOOK UPON HIS LIKE AGAIN
HE WAS LIKEWISE CIVIL AND POLITE IN HIS MANNERS AND A MAN OF GOOD COMMON SENSE
TWO SHOTS WERE FIRED BOTH AS WE BELIEVE THOUGH WE ARE NOT CERTAIN BY THE ASSAILANTS ONE AT THE COLORED MAN WHO FLED INTO THE HOUSE AND THE OTHER AT THE INMATES THROUGH THE WINDOW
ALTHOUGH NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS STATEMENT THE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO AID HIM
HIS MIND WAS WROUGHT UP TO A VERY HIGH STATE OF EARNESTNESS AND HE WAS DEEMED A VERY FITTING SUBJECT FOR CANADA
IT MAY THEREFORE BE INFERRED THAT HER SITUATION WAS NOT REMARKABLY HARD
BUT ONE MAN AND THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK IS KNOWN TO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PRESERVING ANYTHING LIKE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE WORKINGS OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD AS IT WAS CALLED BEFORE EMANCIPATION
THE WRITER IS ONE AMONG VERY MANY WHO ARE ENTITLED TO THE HEARTY SUPPORT OF PHILANTHROPISTS FOR THEIR SERVICES RENDERED OFTEN AT CONSIDERABLE SACRIFICES AND IMMINENT PERIL FOR THE RESCUE AND AID OF THOSE WHO WERE WICKEDLY HELD IN BONDAGE
THREE PAIR WOOLEN SOCKS 2 75 CENTS
HIS INTEREST IN TEMPERANCE NEVER FAILED HIM
BUT AS THESE CAPTAINS HAD A NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENTS AT RICHMOND PETERSBURG C IT WAS NOT DEEMED ALTOGETHER SAFE TO RELY UPON EITHER OF THEM CONSEQUENTLY IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY THE MATTER WAS LAID BEFORE TWO PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMEN WHO WERE EACH OCCUPYING CHAIRS IN ONE OF THE MEDICAL COLLEGES OF PHILADELPHIA
THE ARTICLES SO ACCURATELY DESCRIBED MUST NOW BE PERMITTED TO TESTIFY IN THEIR OWN WORDS AS TAKEN FROM THE RECORDS
THEY LOVED LIBERTY AND HATED SLAVERY AND WHEN THE SLAVE-CATCHERS ARRIVED THEY WERE PREPARED FOR THEM
BUT AS SMOOTHLY AS MATTERS SEEMED TO BE GOING ALONG THE MISCHIEVOUS IDEA CREPT INTO MOSES HEAD THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY CLAIMED BY HIS KIND MISTRESS AND AT THE SAME TIME THE THOUGHT WOULD OFTEN FORCIBLY PRESS UPON HIS MIND THAT HE MIGHT ANY DAY BE SOLD
IF YON HAF TO SEND FOR MY TRONKE TO WASHINGTON SEND THE NAME OF JOHN TROWHARTE
ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MAN OF FAIR PRETENSIONS AND A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH HE KNEW HOW TO DRAW THE CORDS VERY TIGHTLY WITH REGARD TO HIS SLAVES KEEPING HIS FEET ON THEIR NECKS TO THEIR SORE GRIEVANCE
WILSON AND RACHEL BARKER MOORE VISITED THE VARIOUS SETTLEMENTS OF FUGITIVES IN CANADA EXPRESSLY WITH A VIEW OF FINDING OUT WHERE THE FUND WOULD DO THE MOST GOOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TESTATOR'S WISHES
GORSUCH EDWARD 350
FIDGET ISAAC 339
LYNCH WHOM LEWIS DESCRIBED AS A MEAN MAN WHEN DRUNK AND VERY SEVERE ON HIS SLAVES THE NUMBER THAT HE RULED OVER AS HIS PROPERTY WAS ABOUT TWENTY
HE LEFT ONE SISTER AND A STEP-FATHER IN BONDAGE
G.S
ALL THE MATERIAL NECESSARY FOR A STORY OF GREAT INTEREST MIGHT HAVE READILY BEEN FOUND IN THE STORY OF THE MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN
I NOW THANK GOD THAT I HAVE NOT LOST A DAY IN SICKNESS SINCE I CAME TO CANADA
GEORGE ROBINSON STATED THAT HE CAME FROM A PLACE ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILES FROM THE CHESAPEAKE BAY ONE MILE FROM OLD TOWN AND FIVE MILES FROM ELKTON AND WAS OWNED BY SAMUEL SMITH A FARMER WHO WAS PRETTY CROSS AND AN ILL MAN GEORGE'S EXCUSE FOR WITHDRAWING HIS VALUABLE SERVICES FROM MR SMITH AT THE TIME THAT HE DID WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT HE ENTERTAINED FEARS THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO SELL HIM
THE MOTHER OF THESE BOYS WAS FREED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-EIGHT AND LIVED IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE
AFTER EXPRESSING DEEP PITY FOR THESE UNFORTUNATES SHE ADDED
THEY LAUGHED AT ME TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A THING
PROBABLY THE FRIENDS WITH WHOM THEY STOPPED THOUGHT THE WEATHER TOO INCLEMENT FOR A WOMAN WITH CHILDREN DEPENDENT ON HER SUPPORT TO TRAVEL
HE WAS EVER CALM STEADFAST AND STRONG IN THE FORE FRONT OF THE CONFLICT IN HER SEVENTY-NINTH YEAR THE ENERGY OF LUCRETIA MOTT IS UNDIMINISHED AND HER SOUL IS AS ARDENT IN THE CAUSE TO WHICH HER LIFE HAS BEEN DEVOTED AS WHEN IN HER YOUTH SHE PLACED THE WILL OF A TRUE WOMAN AGAINST THE IMPOTENCE OF PREJUDICED MILLIONS
OLIVER JACOB C
HER PATIENCE SELF-DENIAL AND WARM AFFECTION WERE MANIFESTED IN EVERY RELATION OF LIFE
HER MANNERS WERE EQUALLY AGREEABLE
IF YOU COME TO THIS CITY I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU
A BLOW HAS BEEN STRUCK AT MY FREEDOM IN EVERY HUNTED AND DOWN-TRODDEN SLAVE IN THE SOUTH
THIS BEING THE CASE SLAVERY AND OPPRESSION OF ALL KINDS WERE UNPOPULAR AND INDEED ALMOST UNKNOWN AMONGST THEM
SUCH WAS HER HABIT OF MAKING THE SAD LOT OF A SLAVE A PERSONAL MATTER
NOTHING SO AFFECTED ARTHUR'S MIND SO MUCH IN MOVING HIM TO MAKE A BOLD STROKE FOR FREEDOM AS THESE HEIRS
SHE WAS ALSO FROM UNDER THE DUVALL YOKE
AS TO ITS BEING A SWORD-CANE HOWEVER I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE FIRST WORDS TO THE MOTHER WERE
ON THE NIGHT SHE STARTED SHE WENT TO THE BED WHERE THEY WERE SLEEPING KISSED THEM AND CONSIGNING THEM INTO THE HANDS OF GOD BADE HER MOTHER GOOD-BYE AND WITH HER TWO LITTLE GIRLS WENDED HER WAY AGAIN TO BURLINGTON COUNTY NEW JERSEY BUT TO A DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOOD FROM THAT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SEIZED
SECONDLY TO ATTEND TO THE TREATMENT AND INSTRUCTION OF CONVICTS WHILE IN PRISON
IF SUCH SUFFERINGS AND TRIALS WERE NOT ENTITLED TO CLAIM FOR THE SUFFERER THE HONOR OF A HERO WHERE IN ALL CHRISTENDOM COULD ONE BE FOUND WHO COULD PROVE A BETTER TITLE TO THAT APPELLATION
I REJOICE THAT YOU ARE COLLECTING AND PRESENTING THAT TESTIMONY AND HEARTILY WISH YOU A GREAT SUCCESS
WE TAKE THE LIBERTY OF QUOTING AN EXTRACT FROM ONE OF HIS LETTERS
MRS HARPER RECITED IT WITH GOOD EFFECT AND IT WAS WELL RECEIVED
JOHN LATHAM WAS THE MAN WHOM HE ADDRESSED AS MASTER WHICH WAS A VERY BITTER PILL FOR HIM TO SWALLOW
BALLARD GEO
ON THE SUGGESTION OF A FRIEND BEFORE LEAVING HER MISTRESS SHE WAS DISPOSED TO SUE FOR HER FREEDOM BUT UPON A RECONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER SHE CHOSE RATHER TO ACCEPT THE HOSPITALITY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AND LEAVE IN A QUIET WAY AND GO TO CANADA WHERE SHE WOULD BE FREE INDEED
NO CHARGES WHATEVER APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST MR HEINES ACCORDING TO THE RECORD BOOK
ANTHONY WAS OF A RICH BLACK COMPLEXION MEDIUM SIZE ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE
FORMERLY HE HAD OWNED A MUCH LARGER NUMBER BUT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD LED HIM TO MAKE FREQUENT SALES DURING THE FEW YEARS PREVIOUS TO THEIR ESCAPE BY WHICH THE STOCK HAD BEEN REDUCED
UPON INQUIRY OF THESE PASSENGERS INDIVIDUALLY THE FOLLOWING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED
HE LEFT ON THE TWENTY-THIRD OF APRIL AND ARRIVED ABOUT THE SECOND OF JUNE HAVING IN THE MEANTIME ENCOUNTERED DIFFICULTIES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS
WHEN THE HEARSE ARRIVED AT THE QUIET BURIAL PLACE IN ARCH STREET WHERE THE FRIENDS FOR MANY GENERATIONS HAVE BURIED THEIR DEAD SIX COLORED MEN CARRIED THE BODY TO ITS LAST RESTING-PLACE AND THE SILENT TEAR OF THE SON OF AFRICA OVER THE GRAVE OF HIS ZEALOUS FRIEND WAS MORE EXPRESSIVE OF REAL AFFECTION THAN ALL THE PARADE WHICH IS SOMETIMES BROUGHT SO OSTENTATIOUSLY BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
IF IT MEANS ONE'S LIFE IN ONE'S HAND FRIENDSHIPS YIELDED SOCIETY DEFIED AND POSITION IN IT CHEERFULLY RENOUNCED
ADIEU
BY SCHOONER MAJOR LATHAM WILLIAM WILSON HENRY GORHAM WILEY MADDISON AND ANDREW SHEPHERD
HIS EXCUSE FOR LEAVING AND SEEKING A HABITATION IN CANADA WAS AS FOLLOWS
THIS DID NO GOOD
AFTER THINKING OF VARIOUS WAYS THAT MIGHT BE TRIED IT OCCURRED TO WILLIAM AND ELLEN THAT ONE MIGHT ACT THE PART OF MASTER AND THE OTHER THE PART OF SERVANT
SPIRES VALENTINE 319
HE CONCLUDED THAT HE COULD DO NO BETTER THAN TO RENEW HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS OLD FRIENDS ON THIS OCCASION
BUT NEVERTHELESS GOD IN HIS OWN GOOD TIME WILL BRING THEM OUT BY A MIGHTY HAND AS IT IS RECORDED IN THE SACRED ORACLES OF TRUTH THAT ETHIOPIA SHALL SOON STRETCH OUT HER HANDS TO GOD SPEAKING IN THE POSITIVE SHALL AND MY PRAYER IS TO YOU OH SLAVEHOLDER IN THE NAME OF THAT GOD WHO IN THE BEGINNING SAID LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT
THIS IS THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT THEM

BENNETT DAVID AND WIFE MARTHA WITH THEIR TWO CHILDREN 259
JOIN US TO USE SUCH MORAL MEANS AS TO CORRECT PUBLIC SENTIMENT THROUGHOUT THE REGION WHERE SLAVERY EXISTS AND TO IMPRESS UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATES A MANLY SENSE OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS

LEWIS TAPPAN IN THE FREEDMEN'S WORK HE TRAVELED EXTENSIVELY AND WORKED HARD ESTABLISHING SCHOOLS AT THE SOUTH AND ORGANIZING PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN THE FREE STATES
SEVERAL SLAVE PENS AND PRISONS WERE CONSTANTLY KEPT UP TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRADE
SO HE LEFT THE PORTLY-LOOKING DR HUGHES WITH NO FEELING OF INDEBTEDNESS OR REGRET
I FULLY AND HEARTILY CONCUR IN THE OPINION OF COL
BUT AS IN SO MANY INSTANCES IN THE EXPERIENCE OF SLAVES LATTERLY TIMES HAD CHANGED WITH HER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO SERVE UNDER A NEW MASTER WHO OFT-TIMES TREATED HER VERY SEVERELY ON ONE OCCASION SEVEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY A BROTHER OF HER OWNER FOR A TRIFLING OFFENCE STRUCK AND KICKED HER SO BRUTALLY THAT SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY THROWN INTO A FIT OF SICKNESS WHICH LASTED ALL ONE SUMMER"--FROM THIS SHE FINALLY RECOVERED
SEEKING AS USUAL TO LEARN HIS HISTORY THE SUBJOINED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WERE THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
IT IS A BRUSH ARBOR
AFTER THAT HE BEAT THE CHERRY-TREE LIMB ALL TO PIECES OVER ME

SCOTT 536
THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAY REMEMBER HOW AT THAT TIME IN PERFECT FORGETFULNESS OF SELF THE RELATION OF THE HEROISM OF HIS FRIEND ELISHA TYSON SEEMED TO RECALL FOR A MOMENT THE VIGOR OF YOUTH TO RENDER THE DECREPITUDE OF AGE ALMOST MAJESTIC
MY POST OFFICE IS LAUREL N.C
PIPKINS LOUISA 136

BOOZE RICHARD J 393
OTHER COLORED MEN WHO KNEW BOTH DAVIS AND CHARLES AS WELL AS ONE MAN ORDINARILY KNOWS ANOTHER REJOICED AT SEEING CHARLES IN PHILADELPHIA AND THEY LISTENED WITH PERFECT FAITH TO HIS STORY
THEY TALKED VERY GOOD TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ME WITH THEM TO A FREE STATE THAT I MUST NOT LEAVE THEM
MRS HARPER HAS A SPLENDID ARTICULATION USES CHASTE PURE LANGUAGE HAS A PLEASANT VOICE AND ALLOWS NO ONE TO TIRE OF HEARING HER
I LIVE ALONE
SHE HAD GREAT FAITH IN GOD AND FOUND MUCH SOLACE IN SINGING SOME OF THE GOOD OLD METHODIST TUNES BY DAY AND NIGHT
APPARENTLY THE VIGILANCE OF SLAVE-HUNTERS WAS NOT SLACKENED BY THIS DEFEAT AS THE RECORDS SHOW THAT MANY EXCITING CASES TOOK PLACE IN PHILADELPHIA AND PENNSYLVANIA AND IF THE RECORDS OF THE OLD ABOLITIONIST SOCIETY COULD BE PUBLISHED AS THEY SHOULD BE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT MANY HARD-FOUGHT BATTLES HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN FREEDOM AND SLAVERY ON THIS SOIL
NUMEROUS PUBLIC RECEPTIONS OF A MOST FLATTERING CHARACTER WERE GIVEN TO HIM BUT WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF CAUSING HIM TO MAGNIFY HIS OWN MERITS OR TO FORGET THE HONOR DUE TO HIS ASSOCIATES IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY STRUGGLE
BOTH MR AND MRS HARDING SHE CONSIDERED BAD ENOUGH BUT ADDED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE YOUNG SET I COULD GET ALONG WITH THEM
MAY GOD IN SOME WAY GRANT THEM DELIVERANCE
THE RELIEF AND JOY WERE UNSPEAKABLY GREAT YET THEY WERE STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND
AS FAR AS THE COLORED PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO GET HOMES FOR THEMSELVES AND DEPOSITING MONEY IN BANK
FORTUNATELY AS THE SLAVES THOUGHT SHE HAD NO CHILDREN OR NEAR RELATIVES TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR JUST AND PROMISED RIGHTS
SIMMONS WAS PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS TYRANNICAL RULE AND TREATMENT OF HIS SLAVES--SO HENRY AND ISAIAH HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO WITHDRAW FROM UNDER HIS YOKE VERY YOUNG IN LIFE
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE SO ENRAGED THE OWNER THAT HE DECLARED HE WOULD SELL ALL HE OWNED
WILL AND DUTY CEASED TO BE SEPARATE POWERS
PHILIP HAD A MASTER BY THE NAME OF JOHN SMITH WHOM HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF BUT HARDLY KNEW HOW
HIS NAME WAS TUNIS
THE THIRD DAY SHE BEGAN TO COME TO HERSELF AND TALK QUITE FREELY
MUTUAL THREATENINGS WERE UTTERED BY THE TWO PARTIES
OF INDIA OR AUSTRALIA OR OF THE PROLIFIC WEST INDIA ISLANDS
HIS WIFE IS CROSS AND PEEVISH SHE USED TO TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN TORTURING ONE LITTLE SLAVE BOY HE WAS THE SON OF HIS MASTER AND WAS OWNED BY HIM
GARRETT THOMAS 74
THESE FOUR JOURNEYED FROM EGYPT TOGETHER--BUT DID NOT LEAVE THE SAME KIND PROTECTOR GEORGE WAS A FULL BLACK ORDINARY SIZE TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND A CONVERT TO THE DOCTRINE THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO HIMSELF
WHEN HIS EYES WOULD BE OFF OF HERS SUCH EAGERNESS AS HER LOOKS EXPRESSED INDICATIVE OF HER ENTREATY THAT WE WOULD NOT FORSAKE HER AND HER LITTLE ONES IN THEIR WEAKNESS IT HAD NEVER BEEN MY LOT TO WITNESS BEFORE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
ALL BELONGED TO JESSE LATEN
I LEFT ANSWERED C BECAUSE I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO LIVE WITH MY WIFE
BY MEANS LIKE THESE THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR THE PREDESTINED TASKS OF THEIR AFTER-LIFE
THE OFFENCE OF TREASON IS NOT TRIABLE IN THIS COURT
BUT HE WAS NOT IN
MOST OF THEM WERE BADLY FROST-BITTEN BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT MY HOUSE
THE BOY RAN IN TO GET IT
WHILE IT WAS A FACT THAT HIS WIFE HAD ALREADY BEEN SOLD AS ABOVE STATED THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP WAS NOT TO TAKE PLACE FOR SOME MONTHS CONSEQUENTLY JOHN TOOK OUT IN A HURRY HIS WIFE WAS THE PROPERTY OF DR SHIPLEY OF SEAFORD WHO HAD OCCASION TO RAISE SOME MONEY FOR WHICH HE GAVE SECURITY IN THE SHAPE OF THIS WIFE AND MOTHER
SO THEY REMAINED ONE MONTH IN CONFINEMENT
AND I DO NOT DEEM IT NECESSARY TO REPEAT THEIR PROVISIONS AT THIS TIME
BLOW ANTHONY ALIAS HENRY LEVISON 61
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE A WIFE AND FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN LIVING IN ALEXANDRIA VA
HEATH CHAS 499
HE WAS MUCH AFFECTED BY THEIR KINDNESS AND WE ARE TOLD EXPRESSED HIS REGRET THAT HE HAD BEEN THUS ENGAGED AND HIS DETERMINATION IF HIS LIFE WAS SPARED NEVER AGAIN TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT
WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI-SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM
LIKE OTHER TAVERNS HERE THE WRETCHEDNESS IS INDESCRIBABLE
IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT BEST TO SEND YOU A SCHEDULE OF THE CONTENTS OF SAID BOX
NOW WHAT DISPOSITION WAS MADE OF THEM AFTER THEY HAD LEFT THE WHARF WHILE WILLIAMSON AND WHEELER WERE DISCUSSING MATTERS--(AS WAS CLEARLY SWORN TO BY PASSMORE IN HIS ANSWER TO THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS)--HE WILLIAMSON DID NOT KNOW
HE ASKED ME IF I COULD RECOGNIZE THE FAVOR OF THIS MAHALA
HE WAS FIRST OWNED BY MRS CAROLINE JOHNSON A STINGY WIDOW THE OWNER OF ABOUT FIFTY SLAVES AND A MEMBER OF DR PLUMMER'S CHURCH ELIJAH AT HER DEATH WAS WILLED TO HER SON MAJOR JOHNSON WHO WAS IN THE UNITED STATES SERVICE
IN 1854 CHARLES WAS OWNED IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND BY BENJAMIN DAVIS A NOTORIOUS NEGRO TRADER
EDWARD THE HUSBAND WAS ABOUT FORTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF A DARK COLOR WELL MADE FULL FACE PLEASANT COUNTENANCE AND TALKED FLUENTLY
ON HIS ARRIVAL MEDICAL ATTENTION AND OTHER NECESSARY COMFORTS WERE PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE WHO HOPED WITH HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD BE RESTORED WITH THE LOSS OF HIS TOES ALONE
THEREFORE I PROPOSE TO REMAIN WHERE THIS GREAT PROBLEM IS IN THE PROCESS OF SOLUTION
ARRIVING AS USUAL IN DUE TIME THESE FUGITIVES WERE EXAMINED AND ALL FOUND TO BE EXTRA FIELD HANDS
SHE ENTERED THE COURT ROOM VEILED AND OF COURSE WAS NOT KNOWN BY THE CROWD AS PAINS HAD BEEN TAKEN TO KEEP THE PUBLIC IN IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT SHE WAS TO BE BROUGHT ON TO BEAR WITNESS
THIS TOGETHER WITH THE TASK OF SUPPORTING HERSELF AND TWO CHILDREN MADE HER BURDEN VERY GRIEVOUS
THEY ALL CAME FROM ALDER LOUDON COUNTY VIRGINIA ROBERT IS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE MEDIUM SIZE DARK CHESTNUT COLOR INTELLIGENT AND RESOLUTE
BUT IF TO SECURE THESE WE MUST SELL OUR MANHOOD AND SULLY OUR SOULS THEN THEIR BAD OPINIONS OF US ARE TO BE COVETED INSTEAD
JAMES WAS A LIKELY-LOOKING YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY YEARS OF AGE DARK TALL AND SENSIBLE
SO THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO TRY THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD HIT OR MISS THIS RESOLUTION WAS MADE AND CARRIED INTO EFFECT ON THE PART OF CHARLES AT LEAST AT THE COST OF LEAVING A MOTHER THREE BROTHERS AND THREE SISTERS IN SLAVERY WITHOUT HOPE OF EVER SEEING THEM AGAIN
BUT IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE ARTFUL FUGITIVES SAFELY REACHED PHILADELPHIA BEFORE THE HUNTERS GOT EVEN THE FIRST SCENT ON THEIR TRACK
THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS IN THAT DAY BORE IN MIND THE ADVICE OF THEIR GREAT FOUNDER FOX WHOSE LAST WORDS WERE
HE SAID I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND ALL THAT WILL COME
BECAUSE OF HIS FIGHTING KNOCKING AND CARRYING ON SO WAS THE PROMPT ANSWER
ON MOTION THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS MEETING WERE ORDERED TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN ADJOURNED WILLIAM STILL SECRETARY
WE HAVE FOUND THE TWO RUST BOYS JOHN AND ELSEY BRADLEY WHO THE VILLAIN OF A BUST TOOK OUT OF JAIL AND SOLD TO A TRADER OF THE NAME OF MORRIS WHO SOLD THEM TO A TRADER WHO TOOK THEM TO RICHMOND VIRGINIA WHERE THEY WERE SOLD AT PUBLIC SALE TWO DAYS BEFORE WE FOUND THEM FOR $2600 BUT FORTUNATELY THE MAN HAD NOT PAID FOR THEM
ACCORDINGLY THE COLONEL ACCOMPANIED HIM AND FOUND THAT TWENTY-TWO PASSENGERS HAD BEEN ON HAND WITHIN THE PAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND AT LEAST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN WERE THEN IN HIS PRESENCE
BUT THE OLD MAN HAD NOT CONSENTED
HAVING THE CONTRACT
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS ARDENT DESIRE FOR LIBERTY THE SLAVE CONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY TO REMAIN IN BONDAGE UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD IN ORDER TO REPAY BY HIS LABOR THE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE WHICH HIS MASTER HAD HAD IN REARING HIM
I WISH YOU SEE JAMES MORRIS WHOM OR ABRAM GEORGE THE FIRST AND SECOND ON THE SHIP PENN GIVE MY RESPECTS TO THEM AND ASK JAMES IF HE WILL CALL AT HENRY W
HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO SEEK A PASSAGE NORTH VIA THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
BUT THE POWER SHALL NOT ALWAYS BE ON THE SIDE OF THE OPPRESSOR
THE LOAD BROUGHT ME TO THE GROUND AND I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE FURTHER STRUGGLE FOR MYSELF
HIS GERMAN MASTER HE SPOKE OF AS BEING A TOLERABLY FAIR MAN CONSIDERING HIS ORIGIN AT LEAST HE TOWNSEND HAD NOT SUFFERED MUCH FROM HIM
MY DEAREST FRANCES I HOPE YOU WILL REMEMBER ME NOW GUST AS SAME AS YOU DID WHEN I WERE THERE WITH YOU BECAUSE MY MIND ARE WITH YOU NIGHT AND DAY THE LOVE THAT I BEAR FOR YOU IN MY BREAST IS GREATER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS IF I HAD THOUGHT I HAD SO MUCH LOVE FOR YOU I DONT THINK I EVER COULD LEFT BEING I HAVE ESCAPE I AND HAS FLED INTO A LAND OF FREEDOM
DOUBTLESS SOME DID SOON FORGET THEIR FRIENDS
GREAT-HEARTED PHILANTHROPIST WHAT HEROISM COULD EXCEED THY OWN
MATTHEW BODAMS PLYMOUTH NORTH CAROLINA
I MADE FAIR PROMISES WISHING TO TRAVEL AND THEY PLACED ALL CONFIDENCE IN ME
COATES STARTED IN PURSUIT ON HORSEBACK
ALWAYS HIRED ME OUT AND THEN I COULDN'T PLEASE HIM WHAT KIND OF A MAN WAS HE A MAN WITH A VERY SEVERE TEMPER
IT WAS RATHER A STORMY TIME IN THE HOUSE
ELIZABETH HAD NO FAITH IN SUCH RELIGION
THANK GOD MR GARRISON APPEARS BEFORE US AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES
DOUBTLESS THERE WERE A FEW FRIENDS IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM BUT THEY WERE POWERLESS TO AID THE OLD MAN
WHILE WE REGRET AS SHE SAYS THAT HER EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF MR MONTGOMERY IS EXCEPTIONAL IT IS EASY TO ANTICIPATE THE HARVEST OF SUCH A SOWING
NOR IS IT LIKELY THAT HER SISTERS WERE IMPRESSED LESS DEEPLY
CONTEMPORARY WITH ESTHER MOORE AND LIKEWISE AN INTIMATE PERSONAL FRIEND OF HERS ABIGAIL GOODWIN OF SALEM N.J WAS ONE OF THE RARE TRUE FRIENDS TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WHOSE LABORS ENTITLE HER NAME TO BE MENTIONED IN TERMS OF VERY HIGH PRAISE

FROM ONE OF THE LEADING DAILY JOURNALS OF PHILADELPHIA WE COPY AS FOLLOWS
TORONTO MARCH 17TH 1854
IT SO HAPPENED THAT RICHARD AT THIS TIME WAS INVOLVED IN A MATRIMONIAL DIFFICULTY
AND WHEN HE WAS SAFE OFF IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT JOHN WAS NOT A WHIT MORE DELIGHTED THAN WAS HIS INTENDED IRISH LASSIE MARY WEAVER
RARELY DID THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION PRESENT THE RELATIONS OF MISTRESS AND MAID-SERVANT IN A LIGHT SO APPARENTLY FAVORABLE AS IN THE CASE OF MRS JOSEPH CAHELL WIDOW OF THE LATE HON
NOW CONCERNING THE CITY TORONTO THIS CITY IS BEAUTIFUL AND PROSPEROUS LEVELE CITY
NOT A WORD DID HE REVEAL TO A LIVING SOUL OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE
THE OBJECT OF THE LETTER WAS TO PURCHIS FROM ME 4 NEGROS THAT IS PETERS WIFE 3 CHILDREN 2 SONS 1 GIRL THE NAME OF SAID NEGRES ARE THE WOMAN VINEY THE MOTHER ELDEST SON PETER 21 OR 2 YEARS OLD SECOND SON LEVEN 19 OR 20 YEARS 1 GIRL ABOUT 13 OR 14 YEARS OLD
THERE WAS NO CONTRACT
BUT A FEW EXTRACTS MUST SUFFICE
I ASKED HIM HOW HE ESCAPED FROM SO MANY
AN AGITATOR FROM CONVICTION AND NOT FROM CHOICE HE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO LAY DOWN THE HEAVY BURDEN OF A LIFE-TIME AND RETIRE TO WELL-EARNED REPOSE AFTER SUCH A VISION OF FAINT HOPE REALIZED AS CERTAINLY NO OTHER REFORMER WAS EVER BLESSED WITH
ALTHOUGH THESE THREE PASSENGERS ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA AT THE SAME TIME THEY DID NOT COME FROM MARYLAND TOGETHER
THIS SELF-FORGETFULNESS WAS MADE EASY BY A LOVE THAT FILLED AND OVERFILLED ALL THEIR MORAL ENERGIES--THE SIMPLE LOVE OF MAN AS GOD'S HIGHEST CREATION AND OF HIS NATURAL RIGHTS AS GOD'S BEST GIFT
AND YE SENT HER BACK TO TORTURE ROBBED OF FREEDOM AND OF RIGHT
THESE WERE ALL GLADLY RECEIVED BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP WARMLY EXTENDED TO THEM
THE SUBJOINED LETTER IS A FAIR SAMPLE OF HIS CORRESPONDENCE
AT ALL TIMES WHEN THE FUNDS WERE INADEQUATE HIS AID COULD BE COUNTED UPON FOR SURE RELIEF
I DO NOT THINK THAT I COULD HAVE GONE AT AN EARLIER PERIOD EXCEPT AT THE PERIL OF MY LIFE
THE COURT HOWEVER SAID THE QUESTION COULD BE PUT
AND I ASK NOW ONLY THIS
BUT IT MUST HERE BE ADMITTED THAT IN LOOKING CAREFULLY OVER THE MORE PERILOUS METHODS RESORTED TO ROBERT BROWN ALIAS THOMAS JONES STANDS SECOND TO NONE WITH REGARD TO DEEDS OF BOLD DARING
THUS IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO COMPANIONS HE WAS PREPARED FOR ANY SACRIFICE
INSTEAD OF WEEPING OVER THE SAD SITUATION OF HIS PENNILESS MISTRESS AND SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF CONTRITION FOR HAVING WRONGED THE MAN WHO HELD THE MORTGAGE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS ON HIM JAMES ACTUALLY FEELS REJOICED IN THE LORD FOR HIS LIBERTY AND IS VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH TORONTO BUT IS NOT SATISFIED YET HE IS EVEN CONCOCTING A PLAN BY WHICH HIS WIFE MIGHT BE RUN OFF FROM RICHMOND WHICH WOULD BE THE CAUSE OF HER OWNER HENRY W
THIS LED HIM TO INVESTIGATE THE LAWS RELATING TO THIS CLASS OF PERSONS IN ALL THEIR EXTENDED RAMIFICATIONS
MOSES WAS TWENTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE OF A CHESTNUT COLOR A BRIGHT-LOOKING YOUNG MAN
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH AFFORDED HIM GROUND FOR BEING POSITIVE WAS AS HE TESTIFIED ON CROSS-EXAMINATION THAT HE WAS FROM HOME AT A CAMP-MEETING WHEN SHE RUN AWAY
WILLSON NOW-A-DAYS
MY COMPLIMENTS TO ALL ENQUIRING FRIENDS
I NEVER KNEW OF MAHALA RICHARDSON BEFORE LAST EVENING IN COURT
ALL ATTEMPTS TO PROCURE ASSISTANCE TO CAPTURE THE FUGITIVE SLAVES FAILED THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER NOT RELISHING THE BUSINESS OF SLAVE-CATCHING OR AT LEAST NOT CHOOSING TO RISK THEIR LIVES IN IT
AND AS I HAVE SAID RIGHT THERE IS ONE EXPLANATION OF THE ANOMALY
DORSEY WILLIAM FRANCIS MARY ELLEN AND BABY
YE MAY OFFER HUMAN VICTIMS LIKE THE HEATHEN PRIESTS OF OLD
ENCLOSED I SEND YOU A NOTICE FROM ONE OF THE LEADING AND REPRESENTATIVE PAPERS OF REBELDOM
PREDO HENRY 72
STILL--DEAR SIR:--I CAME FROM VIRGINIA IN MARCH AND WAS AT YOUR OFFICE THE LAST OF MARCH
ROBERT CAME FROM SEAFORD WHERE HE HAD SERVED UNDER CHARLES WRIGHT A FARMER OF CONSIDERABLE MEANS AND THE OWNER OF A NUMBER OF SLAVES OVER WHOM HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RULE WITH MUCH RIGOR
I UNITED WITH THE CHURCH AFTER I FIRST SAW HER
THREE TIMES SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN TIED UP
TWO OF THEM TALKED WITH ISABELLA ASKED HER ABOUT HER BOARDERS ETC
ACCORDINGLY THEY WERE TAKEN INTO THE JAIL
HER STEP-SON J
JULIA HOWEVER HAD BEEN SOLD TWICE BEFORE HER MISTRESS DEATH
ALTHOUGH SO SHAMEFULLY DEFRAUDED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HE CONCLUDED TO BEAR THE DISAPPOINTMENT AS PATIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND GET OUT OF THE LION'S MOUTH AS BEST HE COULD
THE TOLL-GATE KEEPER SEEING AT ONCE THAT HE WAS A FUGITIVE SAID TO HIM I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW THE ROAD I GUESS I CAN FIND IT MYSELF WAS THE REPLY
THE NEXT DAY WAS THANKSGIVING-DAY AND MY HOUSE WAS THRONGED WITH GUESTS
ON DELIVERING UP HIS CHARGE THE DR SIMPLY REMARKED TO THE WRITER'S WIFE I WISH TO LEAVE THIS YOUNG LAD WITH YOU A SHORT WHILE AND I WILL CALL AND SEE FURTHER ABOUT HIM WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION HE STEPPED INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND HURRIED AWAY EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO REPORT HIMSELF TO HIS WIFE IN ORDER TO RELIEVE HER MIND OF A GREAT WEIGHT OF ANXIETY ON HIS ACCOUNT
THEY WOULD NOT FOLLOW ME AND I KEPT ON STRAIGHT TO THE WOODS
THAT IT SHALL BE THE DUTY OF ALL MARSHALS AND DEPUTY MARSHALS TO OBEY AND EXECUTE ALL WARRANTS AND PRECEPTS ISSUED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT WHEN TO THEM DIRECTED
OFFICE C.W
ON SABBATH I SPOKE FROM PSALM XII
WE ARE HEARING BUT LITTLE ABOUT HIM AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK ON HIS BEHALF ALLOW US TO SAY TO ONE AND ALL WHO MAY BE THUS CIRCUMSTANCED THAT WE DO NOT LOOK FOR GREAT THINGS BUT THAT IF THEY CAN LEVY A SHILLING A YEAR FROM ALL WHO FEEL FOR THE INJURED BONDMAN THESE LITTLE SUMS WOULD SOON MOUNT UP AND PROVE OF INCALCULABLE SERVICE TO THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY TO JAMES
AFTER THE PROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION HE ADVOCATED AN EARLY DISSOLUTION OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY ORGANIZATION AND AT THE MAY MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY IN 1864 INTRODUCED A PROPOSITION LOOKING TO THAT RESULT
HER APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD BEEN AMONG THE MORE FAVORED CLASS OF SLAVES
SHADD AND MY SISTER AMELIA JOIN THEIR LOVE AND CONDOLENCE WITH MINE TO YOU ALL HOPING THAT THE VIRTUES OF YOUR FATHER MAY BE A GUIDING STAR TO YOU ALL UNTIL YOU MEET HIM AGAIN IN THAT HAPPY PLACE WHERE PARTING WILL BE NO MORE FOREVER
FOR THE DEFENCE--HON
YOUR BOOK WILL CERTAINLY BE AN INTERESTING ONE
AND IN PURSUANCE AND EXECUTION OF SUCH THEIR WICKED AND TRAITOROUS COMBINATION HE THE SAID JAMES JACKSON THEN AND THERE WITH FORCE AND ARMS WITH THE SAID PERSONS TO A GREAT NUMBER TO WIT THE NUMBER OF ONE HUNDRED PERSONS AND UPWARDS ARMED AND ARRAYED IN A WARLIKE MANNER THAT IS TO SAY WITH GUNS SWORDS AND OTHER WARLIKE WEAPONS AS WELL OFFENSIVE AS DEFENSIVE BEING THEN AND THERE UNLAWFULLY AND TRAITOROUSLY ASSEMBLED DID WICKEDLY KNOWINGLY AND TRAITOROUSLY RESIST AND OPPOSE ONE HENRY H
BY WILLIAM STILL FOR MANY YEARS CONNECTED WITH THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE IN PHILADELPHIA AND CHAIRMAN OF THE ACTING VIGILANT COMMITTEE OF THE PHILADELPHIA BRANCH OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD
THEY WERE PERFECTLY JUSTIFIABLE IN LEAVING KENDALL MAJOR LEWIS AND ALL HIS SYMPATHIZERS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY COULD
I HAVE WRITTEN TO MR BROWN TWO OR THREE TIMES SINCE I LEFT THE CITY
IN LATER LIFE HIS ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES TOLD IN THE VIVID STYLE RESULTING FROM A REMARKABLY RETENTIVE MEMORY WHICH COULD RECALL WORD TONE AND GESTURE BROUGHT TO LIFE SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THESE FLEEING BONDMEN WHOSE HISTORIES NO ROMANCE COULD EVER EQUAL
COMING TO THE COMMITTEE IN WANT THEY CHEERFULLY AIDED HIM AND FORWARDED HIM ON TO CANADA
ALL THE REST I LEAVE TO THE EXPERIENCE AND SAGACITY OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO MAPS OUT THE ENTERPRISE
HER OLDEST BOY SIXTEEN HIRED THE YEAR HE LEFT FOR FORTY DOLLARS
WE ARE ALL IN GOOD HEALTH
ORLANDO J
BEING A LIKELY-LOOKING CHATTEL HE WOULD HAVE DOUBTLESS BROUGHT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE MARKET
DURING THE FORTY YEARS OF SEPARATION EXCEPT TWO OR THREE QUAKER FRIENDS INCLUDING THE DEVOTED FRIEND OF THE SLAVE BENJAMIN LUNDY IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS WERE LET INTO THE SECRET OF HER SLAVE LIFE
THEY WERE ARRESTED AND PUT IN JAIL THERE WITH TOM'S ASSISTANCE AND SOME OFFICERS
IN THIS STATE OF MIND ABOUT THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF NOVEMBER HE TOOK HIS FIRST AND DARING STEP
BUT I SAY GIVE ME FREEDOM AND THE UNITED STATES MAY HAVE ALL HER MONEY AND HER LUXTURES YEAS GIVE LIBERTY OR DEATH
I KEPT MY HEAD JUST ABOVE AND HID THE REST PART OF MY BODY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS
HIS HOME WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO ENTERTAIN THE ANTI-SLAVERY ADVOCATES AND BEING WARMLY SUPPORTED IN THE CAUSE BY HIS EXCELLENT WIFE EVERYTHING WHICH THEY COULD DO TO MAKE THEIR GUESTS COMFORTABLE WAS DONE
ALONG WITH THIS LETTER I SEND YOU ONE FOR MR STEPHENS ONE OF BROWN'S MEN AND WOULD ASK YOU TO SEND HIM A BOX OF NICE THINGS EVERY WEEK TILL HE DIES OR IS ACQUITTED
THE SEVERAL LINES FROM ADAMS COUNTY TO WILMINGTON CONVERGING UPON THE HOUSE OF JOHN VICKERS OF LIONVILLE WHOSE WAGON LADEN APPARENTLY WITH INNOCENT-LOOKING EARTHEN WARE FROM HIS POTTERY SOMETIMES CONVEYED UNSEEN BENEATH THE VISIBLE LOAD A PRECIOUS BURDEN OF SOUTHERN CHATTELS ON THEIR WAY TO MANHOOD

MY FATHER SAID I HAS LONG BEEN ONE OF YOUR FIRST DOCTORS AND DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT FOR HIM TO SELL MY MOTHER AND HIS CHILDREN IN THIS WAY I WAS SOLD AND MY BROTHER ALSO AND THE REST ALTHOUGH MY BROTHER SAID TO THE CROWD WHAT I HAD SAID
TO TRY HIS LUCK ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD AT ALL HAZARDS
AS MOST LIKELY ALL ARE MORE OR LESS LOUSY HAVING BEEN COMPELLED TO SLEEP TOGETHER I THOUGHT BEST TO WRITE THEE SO THAT THEE MAY GET A SUITABLE PLACE TO TAKE THEM TO AND MEET THEM AT BROAD AND PRIME STREETS ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARS ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK TO-MORROW EVENING

NEVERTHELESS AS CHARLES THOUGHT HIS MASTER FIRST-RATE HE SHALL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE OPINION BUT IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT CHARLES WAS NOT DISPOSED TO FIND FAULT WITH HIS KIN AS IT WAS VERY LIKELY THAT THE OLD MASTER CLAIMED SOME OF THE WHITE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS
SHE HAD OCCASION TO GO TO A STORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SHE WAS STOPPING AND TO HER UNSPEAKABLE JOY SHE FOUND THE PROPRIETOR AN ABOLITIONIST AND A FRIEND WHO INQUIRED INTO HER CONDITION AND PROFFERED HER ASSISTANCE
BUT HAVING HER HEART BENT ON FREEDOM SHE RESOLVED THAT NOTHING SHOULD DETER HER FROM PUTTING FORTH EFFORTS TO GET OUT OF SLAVERY
AND THE FEEBLE HEALTH OF ONE OF THE SISTERS AT THAT TIME MUST HAVE MADE HEAVIER THE BURDEN TO BE BORNE
BUT FURTHER INQUIRIES SOON BROUGHT OUT INCIDENTS OF THE MOST THRILLING AND TOUCHING NATURE--NOT WITH REGARD TO HARDSHIPS WHICH THEY HAD PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED BUT IN RELATION TO OUTRAGES WHICH HAD BEEN PERPETRATED UPON THEIR MOTHER
IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO STATE THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIS LABORS IN THE ANTI-SLAVERY CAUSE HE WAS ALSO LABORING WITH ZEAL IN THE CAUSE OF TEMPERANCE
BAILEY THE OTHER DAY AND HE SPOKE OF THE ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL KIND FRIENDS STICKING CLOSE TO HIM UNDER RECENT CIRCUMSTANCES AT ALEXANDRIA WHEN HE WAS EXPOSED TO THE SPITE AND RAGE OF SLAVE-HOLDING BULLIES
THE ESCAPE OF A DENTIST ON THE U.G.R.R.--HE IS TAKEN FOR AN IMPOSTOR--ELECTED A MEMBER OF CITY COUNCIL IN NEW BEDFORD--STUDYING MEDICINE ETC
I CANNOT BUT SOMETIMES ASK IN MY CLOSET MEDITATIONS
HIS MOTHER WAS A FREE-BORN WOMAN OF CHARLESTON
IT IS WELL TO KEEP US FULLY INFORMED OF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES WHETHER FAVORABLE OR MORE APPALLING
BEING ON THE WATCH HE HAILED THE PRIVILEGE AND LEFT WITHOUT LOOKING BACK
PERMIT CHARLES TO PASS AND REPASS FROM THIS OFFICE TO THE RESIDENCE OF REV B
BUT BEFORE I REACHED IT HE STABBED ME DRAWING THE KNIFE A COMMON POCKET KNIFE AS HARD AS HE COULD RIP ACROSS MY STOMACH
NOV
HONEST MEN'S EYES WILL BE OPENED AFTER A WHILE AND THE STANDARD OF RIGHT AND EXPEDIENCY BE ELEVATED
MY REPLY WAS THAT I WILL SELL THEM FOR YOU AND GIVE THE MONEY TO YOUR FAMILY
THE THIRD HE CONCLUDED HE COULD NOT SAVE SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD
JOHN WILLIAMS WHO WAS SAID TO BE A VERY CRUEL MAN RESIDING ON THE WESTERN SHORE OF VA CLAIMED LUCY AS HIS CHATTEL PERSONAL
AT THE SAME TIME IT MAY BE SEEN HOW THE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE BEING IN BONDAGE GRIEVED HIS HEART
RAN AWAY FROM THE SUBSCRIBER ON SUNDAY NIGHT 27TH INST MY NEGRO GIRL LEAR GREEN ABOUT 18 YEARS OF AGE BLACK COMPLEXION ROUND-FEATURED GOOD-LOOKING AND ORDINARY SIZE
THOUGH WEAK IN BODY IN SPIRIT SHE WAS STRONG AND CALM AND SELF-RELIANT WITH A CLEAR DISCRIMINATING INTELLECT A KEEN SENSE OF RIGHT AND A CERTAIN SOLIDITY AND BALANCED SYMMETRY OF THE SPIRITUAL NATURE WHICH MADE HER AN APPRECIABLE POWER WHEREVER SHE WAS KNOWN
THE WANDERERS WERE GLADLY WELCOMED AND MADE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE UNTIL BREAKFAST WAS READY FOR THEM
THE DOOR HAD BEEN SAFELY LOCKED
DISCOURAGED WITH THEIR EFFORTS ON THIS OCCASION THE OFFICERS GAVE UP THE HUNT AND LEFT THE HOUSE
DECK WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AFTER PAYING THE WORTHY CAPTAIN ONE HUNDRED EACH FOR HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER BESIDES MAKING THE CAPTAIN AN ADDITIONAL PRESENT OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED

NO EXTRAVAGANT PRAISE OF ANY KIND,--ONLY SIMPLE FACTS ARE NEEDED TO PORTRAY THE NOBLE DEEDS OF THIS FAITHFUL WORKER
HE WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED AT THE INTELLIGENCE FOR HE WAS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM AND HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS
LOVE TO YOU ALL FROM YOUR LOVING HUSBAND JACOB BLOCKSON
THIS JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES WAS OF COURSE VERY VALUABLE TO HIS MASTER
IN APPEARANCE AND INTELLECT HE REPRESENTED THE ORDINARY MARYLAND SLAVE RAISED ON A FARM SURROUNDED WITH NO REFINING INFLUENCES OR SYMPATHY
THOUGH MUCH MORE MIGHT BE SAID ABOUT THE PARTIES CONCERNED IT MUST SUFFICE TO ADD THAT THEY CAME TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN A VERY SAD PLIGHT--IN TATTERED GARMENTS HUNGRY SICK AND PENNILESS
OUR ATTORNEY HAD THEM BY HABEAS CORPUS BEFORE A JUDGE WHO DETAINED THEM TILL WE CAN PROVE THEIR IDENTITY AND FREEDOM

AND NOW FELLOW-CITIZENS YOU MAY ASK WHAT IS OUR OBJECT IN THUS EXHIBITING TO YOU THE ALARMING INFLUENCE OF THE SLAVE POWER
IT IS A VIVID PORTRAYAL OF THE SLAVE POWER'S INSIDIOUS ENCROACHMENTS AND OF ITS MONOPOLIZED GUIDANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS IN BONDS UNDER THOMAS JEFFRIES WHO WAS A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE DOCTRINE
SAID A BROTHER IF YOU CANNOT GET YOUR FAMILY WHAT WILL YOU DO
I WAS BROUGHT UP BY DANIEL GIBBONS AND AM ASKED TO SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HIM AS AN ABOLITIONIST
NONE REJOICED MORE THAN HE IN THE OVERTHROW OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THOUGH ITS END CAME IN CONVULSION AND BLOODSHED AT WHICH HIS SPIRIT REVOLTED NOT BY THE PEACEFUL MEANS THROUGH WHICH HE WITH OTHERS HAD LABORED TO BRING IT ABOUT
THE ARMY OF THE LATE WAR HAS HAD ITS ROLL OF HONOR YOU WILL GIVE US TWO OTHER ROLLS WORTHY OF EQUAL HONOR--THE ROLL OF FUGITIVES FROM SLAVERY HELPED ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM AND ALSO THE ROLL OF THEIR SELF-SACRIFICING BENEFACTORS

IN THE FALL OF 1855 A SLAVE NAMED JOHNSON WHO IN FLEEING FROM BONDAGE HAD COME AS FAR AS WILMINGTON THINKING HE SAW HIS MASTER ON THE TRAIN BY WHICH HE WAS JOURNEYING NORTHWARD SPRANG FROM THE CAR AND HURT HIS FOOT SEVERELY

AS TO HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS WILLIAM SAID THAT HE WAS A MEMBER OF NOTHING NOW BUT A LIQUOR BARREL KNOWING THAT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS LABORED UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HE WAS SILLY ENOUGH TO LOOK UP TO THEM AS KIND-HEARTED SLAVE-HOLDERS TO WHOM HE SHOULD FEEL HIMSELF INDEBTED FOR EVERYTHING WILLIAM THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE SADLY PUZZLED TO CONJECTURE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM

HIS QUICK SYMPATHIES WERE EASILY TOUCHED AND WHEN TOUCHED WERE SURE TO PROMPT HIM TO CORRESPONDING ACTION
HE WAS LIKEWISE EMPLOYED AS ONE OF THE CARRIERS OF THE RICHMOND DISPATCH
IF YOU KNOW THE ADDRESS OF ANY ONE IN CANADA WHO WOULD BE A GOOD CORRESPONDENT RESPECTING THIS MATTER PLEASE GIVE ME HIS NAME

NOT ONLY WAS SAM SERVICEABLE TO THE DOCTOR IN THE MECHANICAL AND PRACTICAL BRANCHES OF HIS PROFESSION BUT AS A SORT OF READY RECKONER AND AN APT PENMAN HE WAS OBVIOUSLY CONSIDERED BY THE DOCTOR A VALUABLE ARTICLE HE WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE SAM AT HIS BOOKS INSTEAD OF A BOOK-KEEPER

THE DIRECTORS OF THAT GREATEST OF ALL RAILWAY CORPORATIONS THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD WILL NEVER FORGET HIS SERVICES
IN ORDER TO ECONOMIZE TIME AND SPACE WITH A VIEW TO GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF AS MANY OF THE TRAVELERS AS POSSIBLE IT SEEMS EXPEDIENT WHERE A NUMBER OF ARRIVALS COME IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER TO REPORT THEM BRIEFLY UNDER ONE HEAD
IF AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL IT HAD BEEN IMAGINED THAT THE GLORIOUS DAY OF UNIVERSAL FREEDOM WAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OFF DOUBTLESS MUCH FULLER RECORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE OF THESE STRUGGLING UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD PASSENGERS
HOW MANY OTHER MEN IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN THUS FAITHFUL

I HAVE ADVISED HIM TO CALL ON THEE SO THAT NO LAND SHARKS SHALL GET ANY BOUNTY FOR ENLISTING HIM
BUT IT WAS NOT AN EASY MATTER AFTER HAVING BEEN THUS ENTERTAINED TO WRITE OUT THE NARRATIVES OF EIGHT SUCH PERSONS
TWO OTHER PASSENGERS WERE AT THE STATION AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEY HAD TO BE FORWARDED WITHOUT BEING OTHERWISE NOTICED ON THE BOOK
ALTHOUGH CLOSELY SECRETED IN NORFOLK HE HAD THROUGH FRIENDS SOME LITTLE COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

JANE HAD HER TOP EYE OPEN AND IN THAT BRIEF SPACE HAD APPEALED TO THE SYMPATHIES OF A PERSON WHOM SHE VENTURED TO TRUST SAYING I AND MY CHILDREN ARE SLAVES AND WE WANT LIBERTY I AM NOT CERTAIN BUT SUPPOSE THAT PERSON IN THE GOODNESS OF HIS HEART WAS THE CAUSE OF THE NOTE BEING SENT TO THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE AND HENCE THE RESULT
MR STILL:--DEAR SIR--THESE FEW LINES MAY FIND YOU AS THEY LEAVE US WE ARE WELL AT PRESENT AND ARRIVED SAFE IN TORONTO

IT WAS INDESCRIBABLE
HE LITERALLY HAS THE POOR ALWAYS WITH HIM
WE OMIT HIS NAME AND RESIDENCE
