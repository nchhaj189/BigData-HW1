BUT IT WILL NEED TWENTY YEARS WORK ALL DAY LONG
HIS CLAWS ARE LIKE THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCK
BUT THERE IS MORE TRUE MASTERY OF LIGHT AND SHADE IF YOUR EYE IS SUBTLE ENOUGH TO SEE IT IN THE HOLLOWS AND ANGLES OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND FOLDS OF THE DRESS THAN IN ALL THE ETCHINGS OF REMBRANDT PUT TOGETHER
PYTH
HE SEES NOTHING OF THE KIND
THERE IS ANOTHER IMMENSE ADVANTAGE IN THIS BYZANTINE AND GOTHIC ABSTRACTION OF DECISIVE FORM WHEN IT IS JOINED WITH A FAITHFUL DESIRE OF WHATEVER TRUTH CAN BE EXPRESSED ON NARROW CONDITIONS
BUT A DITCH AT IFFLEY WILL IF YOU HAVE HUMANITY IN YOU--ENOUGH IN YOU TO INTERPRET THE FEELINGS OF HEDGERS AND DITCHERS AND FROGS
79
BUT HE IS VERY APT TO DO SO IN PAINTING A MOUNTAIN
PROVIDED ONLY THE PASSION YOU BRING TO IT BE TRUE AND PURE
BUT BEYOND THIS FORGET OR EVEN SOMEWHAT REPRESS YOURSELF AND MAKE IT YOUR FIRST OBJECT TO GIVE A TRUE IDEA OF THE PLACE TO OTHER PEOPLE
LANDSCAPE WITH THE DEATH OF ST PETER MARTYR 78
HERE IS A COPY OF TURNER'S VIGNETTE OF MARTIGNY THIS IS WHOLLY A DESIGN OF THE COLORED SCHOOL
BUT IF YOU GO ON INTO THE VERACITIES OF THE SCHOOL OF CLAY YOU WILL FIND THERE IS SOMETHING AT THE ROOTS OF ALMOND AND APPLE TREES WHICH IS--THIS
AND ATTAINS PERFECT SKILL IN WASHING FLAT COLOR LONG BEFORE HE ATTAINS ANYTHING LIKE SKILL IN DELINEATION OF FORM
THERE'S FIRST A LITTLE BIT OF IT LEFT NEARLY WILD NOT QUITE WILD
THAT IS THE RESULT OF ACADEMICAL WORK IN THE HANDS OF A VULGAR PERSON
I KNOW NO OTHER SUCH LANDSCAPE IN THE WORLD AS THAT IS OR AS THAT WAS
YET IT IS TEN TO ONE THAT IN ANY MODERN GALLERY SUCH A PICTURE WOULD BE HUNG THIRTY FEET FROM THE GROUND
TURNER 19 DUMBLANE ABBEY BY J.M.W
AND THE ST GEORGE OF CARPACCIO AT VENICE ARE ALL THAT I CAN NAME MYSELF OF GREAT WORKS
25
IN PRACTICALLY COMBINING OUTLINE WITH ACCOMPLISHED LIGHT AND SHADE THERE ARE CASES OF THIS KIND IN WHICH THE OUTLINE MAY WITH ADVANTAGE OR EVEN MUST FOR TRUTH OF EFFECT BE OMITTED
AND NOW YOU WILL SEE AT ONCE WITH WHAT FEELING TURNER COMPLETES IN A MORE TENDER MOOD THIS LOVELY SUBJECT OF HIS YORKSHIRE STREAM BY GIVING IT THE CONDITIONS OF PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL LIFE
THE LINES OF THESE ETCHINGS ARE TO TREES ROCKS OR BUILDINGS ABSOLUTELY WHAT THESE OF HOLBEIN ARE
HERE IS A RIPOSO OF OVERBECK'S FOR INSTANCE WHICH THE PAINTER IMAGINED TO BE ELEVATED IN STYLE BECAUSE HE HAD DRAWN IT WITHOUT LIGHT AND SHADE AND WITH ABSOLUTE DECISION
BY ANOTHER TRAGICALLY AS A MYSTERY OF LIGHT AND SHADE CORRESPONDING TO--AND FORMING PART OF--THE JOY AND SORROW OF LIFE
FINALLY FROM THE REMBRANDT GO TO THE LITTLE CIMA NO
IT HAS ALL HIS POWER OF RENDERING CHARACTER AND THE PORTRAIT IS CELEBRATED THROUGH THE WORLD
AND THAT NOT BEING ENOUGH YET FOR THE RIVER-BED MIGHT BE CLEAN THOUGH NOTHING ELSE WAS HE HAS PUT A QUANTITY MORE HANGING OVER THE ABBEY WALLS
THEIR WORK BEING THE MERE BLUNDERING OF CLEVER PEASANTS AND DESERVING NO NAME WHATEVER IN ANY SCHOOL OF TRUE PRACTICE BUT CONSUMMATELY MISCHIEVOUS--FIRST IN ITS EASY SATISFACTION OF THE PAINTER'S OWN SELF-COMPLACENCIES AND THEN IN THE PRETENSE OF ABILITY WHICH BLINDS THE PUBLIC TO ALL THE VIRTUE OF PATIENCE AND TO ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF PRECISION
NOW BEGINNING WISELY SO AS TO LOSE NO TIME OR LABOR YOU WILL LEARN TO PAINT ALL THE CONDITIONS OF QUIET LIGHT AND SKY BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT THOSE OF VARIABLE LIGHT AND CLOUD
THE UNEXCITING COLOR WILL NOT AT FIRST DELIGHT YOU
THE ONE IS THE BORDER-RIDERS KINGDOM
NOW THE NEXT BEST LANDSCAPE[14 TO THIS IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY IS A FLORENTINE ONE ON THE EDGE OF TRANSITION TO THE GREEK FEELING
IN THE GREAT FRENCH ROOM IN THE LOUVRE IF YOU AT ALL REMEMBER THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE HISTORICAL PICTURES YOU WILL INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE IN THINKING GENERALLY OF THEM THE ROUNDED FLESHLY AND SOLID CHARACTER IN THE DRAWING THE GRAY OR GREENISH AND BROWNISH COLOR OR DEFECT OF COLOR LURID AND MOONLIGHT-LIKE AND THE GLOOMY CHOICE OF SUBJECTS AS THE DELUGE THE FIELD OF EYLAU THE STARVATION ON THE RAFT AND THE DEATH OF ENDYMION
LET ME BE SURE NOW THAT YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE RELATION OF FORMAL SHADE TO COLOR
THE LANDSCAPE IN THE GRIMANI MISSAL AT VENICE BEING MONUMENTALLY TYPICAL AND PERFECT
I PLACE FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THESE EGGS IN FRONT OF THE OTHER AND PROBABLY TO MOST OF YOU THE SEPARATION IN THE LIGHT IS INDISCERNIBLE
IT MAY BE FEEBLE OR MUCH FAULTFUL BUT IT WILL BE VITAL AND ESSENTIALLY PRECIOUS
ROUGHLY BY COMPASS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING
HERE IS A PERFECT TYPE THOUGH NOT A COMPLEX ONE OF GOTHIC LANDSCAPE
NAY PERHAPS THE PUBLIC AND MANY FAIR JUDGES WILL AGREE WITH YOU
ON THE CONTRARY THERE ARE CRUDE EFFORTS AT LANDSCAPE-PAINTING MADE CONTINUALLY UPON THE MOST SPLENDID PHYSICAL PHENOMENA IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT ANY HISTORY
YOU WILL FIND IN YOUR EDUCATIONAL SERIES[6 MANY DRAWINGS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE METHOD
ROUNDING A LITTLE ONLY WITH A GLAZE OF LAKE
THESE ALSO ARE EACH PAINTED WITH EXQUISITELY ARTISTIC PURPOSE
4
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT THE OVAL WINDOW IN ITS WEST END IS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST PIECES OF ROUGH THIRTEENTH-CENTURY CARVING IN THE KINGDOM
AND THEREFORE HIS COLOR CATCHES THE LOWER PUBLIC AND GETS TALKED ABOUT
YET OBSERVE I HAVE TOLD YOU OF IT HE HAS PUT INTO ONE SCENE THE SPIRIT OF SCOTLAND
BUT WITH THE ABSOLUTELY LITERAL AND BRUTAL PART OF HIS DUTCH NATURE SUPPOSES THE HEAD OF ARGUS FULL OF REAL EYES ALL OVER AND REPRESENTS HEBE CUTTING THEM OUT WITH A BLOODY KNIFE AND PUTTING ONE INTO THE HAND OF THE GODDESS LIKE AN UNSEEMLY OYSTER
BUT THE ESSENTIAL VALUE OF THE WORK IS NOT IN THESE
FOR INSTANCE HERE IS A DRAWING BY HOLBEIN OF A LADY IN A DARK DRESS WITH BARS OF BLACK VELVET ROUND HER ARM
BETWEEN THESE--THE HIGHEST AND THESE--THE BASEST YOU HAVE EVERY VARIETY AND COMBINATION OF STRENGTH AND OF MISTAKE
NOW FOR YOUR OWN PRACTICE IN THIS HAVING FIRST ACQUIRED THE SKILL OF EXQUISITE DELINEATION AND LAYING OF PURE COLOR DAY BY DAY YOU MUST DRAW SOME LOVELY NATURAL FORM OR FLOWER OR ANIMAL WITHOUT OBSCURITY--AS IN MISSAL PAINTING
DATE TIME OF DAY TEMPERATURE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF WIND
AND YOU ARE PREPARED TO RECOGNIZE IT BY ANY ONE OF THESE THREE CONDITIONS
YOU HAVE THE WHITE OF FOAMING WATER OF BUILDINGS AND CLOUDS BROUGHT OUT BRILLIANTLY FROM A WHITE GROUND
HE TAKES A PIECE OF BROWN PAPER WORKS FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES WITH HIS WHITE BRUSH PASSES THE BLACK TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND WORKS HALF A MINUTE WITH THAT AND THERE YOU ARE
BUT HERE AMONG THE TORRENTS OF THE GREAT CHARTREUSE WHERE ANOTHER MAN WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE DRAWN THE MONASTERY TURNER ONLY DRAWS THEIR WORKING MILL
THE GRAPES SO FAR FROM BEING DRAWN AS ROUND ARE STRUCK IN WITH ANGULAR FLAT SPOTS
THE LEARNING OF THE ACADEMY IS INDEED A SPLENDID ACCESSORY TO ORIGINAL POWER IN VELASQUEZ IN TITIAN OR IN REYNOLDS
IT DOES NOT DISTURB OR EVEN SURPRISE HIM MUCH LESS DISPLEASE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE
SI SIC OMNIA!_--BUT I KNOW NOTHING ELSE EQUAL TO IT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORKS OF RUBENS
THIS METHOD IS INDEED RARELY USED BY RAPHAEL OR MICHAEL ANGELO IN THE DRAWINGS THEY HAVE LEFT US BECAUSE THEIR STUDIES ARE NEARLY ALL TENTATIVE--EXPERIMENTS IN COMPOSITION IN WHICH THE IMPERFECT OR CARELESS PEN OUTLINE SUGGESTED ALL THEY REQUIRED AND WAS CAPABLE OF EASY CHANGE WITHOUT CONFUSING THE EYE
FOOTNOTE 5
YOU WILL FIND THAT IT INTENSIFIES AND EXPLAINS THE FORMS WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ESCAPED NOTICE AND THAT A PERFECTLY GRADATED WASH OF NEUTRAL TINT WITH AN OUTLINE OF THIS KIND IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR GRAMMATICAL STATEMENT OF FORMS
AND SO HE HAS ENDED IN MAKING WITH HIS ESSENTIALLY PIGGISH NATURE THIS SLEEPING SWAN'S NECK AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE LIKE A LEG OF PORK
HERE IS A BIT OF VINE IN THE FOREGROUND WITH PURPLE GRAPES
AND HAS THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT NEVER SWAN HAS BEEN SO ENGRAVED BEFORE
NATIONAL GALLERY NO
TI DE TIS
IN YOUR COPYING SERIES I HAVE PUT A SKETCH BY TURNER IN COLOR FROM NATURE
AND YOU MUST NOT BE TROUBLED THEREFORE IF SOMETIMES MOMENTARY CONTRADICTIONS SEEM TO ARISE IN EXAMINING SPECIAL POINTS
THAT IS TO SAY IN PENCIL OR PEN OUTLINE
95
THE JOHN BELLINI LATELY PRESENTED TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY;[12 ANOTHER JOHN BELLINI IN ROME
SO TURNER HAS PUT A WREATH OF PERFECTLY WHITE SMOKE THROUGH THE TREES
SO THAT THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL VISIONARY PASSIONATE AND FANTASTIC IN PURPOSE ARE IN METHOD TRENCHANTLY FORMAL AND CLEAR
IN BOTH THE VEGETATION THOUGH BEAUTIFUL IS ABSOLUTELY WILD AND UNCARED FOR AS IT SEEMS EITHER BY HUMAN OR BY HIGHER POWERS WHICH HAVING APPOINTED FOR IT THE LAWS OF ITS BEING LEAVE IT TO SPRING INTO SUCH BEAUTY AS IS CONSISTENT WITH DISEASE AND ALTERNATE WITH DECAY
IF ANY DID AND FOUND IT I AM NEARLY CERTAIN THEIR IMPRESSION WOULD BE ONLY THAT OF AN EXTREME WONDER HOW TURNER COULD HAVE MADE SO LITTLE OF SO BEAUTIFUL A SPOT
WHENEVER YOU FIND TURNER STOPPING SHORT OR APPARENTLY FAILING IN THIS WAY ESPECIALLY WHEN HE DOES THE CONTRARY OF WHAT ANY OF US WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARLY SURE TO DO THEN IS THE TIME TO LOOK FOR YOUR MAIN LESSON FROM HIM
LIBRARY EDITION THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN RUSKIN CROWN OF WILD OLIVE TIME AND TIDE QUEEN OF THE AIR LECTURES ON ART AND LANDSCAPE ARATRA PENTELICI NATIONAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION NEW YORK CHICAGO ILLUSTRATION
THERE IS MICHAEL ANGELO'S
SO THAT OF EXQUISITELY DEVELOPED GOTHIC LANDSCAPE YOU MAY COUNT THE EXAMPLES ON THE FINGERS OF YOUR HAND
38
THE UNIVERSAL LAW FOR THEM BEING THAT THEY CAN DRAW A PIG BUT NOT A VENUS
THE LADY WITH THE BROOCH
WHENEVER THEY ARE SHARP THE LINE OF SEPARATION FOLLOWED BY THE POINT OF YOUR DRAWING INSTRUMENT IS THE PROPER OUTLINE OF YOUR SUBJECT WHETHER IT REPRESENTS THE LIMITS OF FLAT SPACES OR OF SOLID FORMS
THAT IS IGNOBLY PASSIONATE CHIAROSCURO REJOICING IN DARKNESS RATHER THAN LIGHT
AND NOT IN THE ABSOLUTE POSSESSION BY ONE GROUP AND ABSENCE IN THE REST OF ANY GIVEN SKILL
AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY SPASMODIC EFFORTS AND FITS OF ENTHUSIASM AND GREEN MEADOWS AND APPLE-BLOSSOM TO SPARE IT YET REMAINS A FACT THAT NOT IN ALL THIS ENGLAND AND STILL LESS IN FRANCE HAVE YOU A PAINTER WHO HAS BEEN ABLE NOBLY TO PAINT SO MUCH AS A HEDGE OF WILD ROSES OR A FOREST GLADE FULL OF ANEMONES OR WOOD-SORREL
IN MY LAST LECTURE I LAID BEFORE YOU EVIDENCE THAT THE GREATNESS OF THE MASTER WHOM I WISHED YOU TO FOLLOW AS YOUR ONLY GUIDE IN LANDSCAPE DEPENDED PRIMARILY ON HIS STUDYING FROM NATURE ALWAYS WITH THE POINT
LIGHT AND SHADE
56
THE CATTLE HAVE STRAYED DOWN TO THE RIVERSIDE IT BEING A HOT DAY
YOU MAY EASILY--YOU MUST PERHAPS FOR A LITTLE TIME--SUSPECT ME OF EXAGGERATION IN THIS STATEMENT
NOW SEE WHAT THE LANDSCAPE CONSISTS IN WHICH I HAVE TOLD YOU IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER PAINTED BY MAN
AND DE WIT IS PSEUDO-GREEK FOR HE IS THINKING NOT OF THE SWAN AT ALL BUT OF HIS OWN DUTCH SELF
TINTORET'S PASSION MAY BE LIKE THE REICHENBACH AND YOURS ONLY LIKE A LITTLE DRIPPING HOLYWELL BUT BOTH EQUALLY FROM DEEP SPRINGS
I FULLY ANTICIPATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRE-RAPHAELITE MOVEMENT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED FORWARD THIS METHOD OF WORK
6
NOW IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU SHOULD CONVINCE YOURSELVES OF AND FULLY ENTER INTO THIS TRUTH BECAUSE ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING SUBJECT ARISES FROM MISTAKES ABOUT IT
NEXT TO THIS DRAWING OF PSYCHE I PLACE TWO OF TURNER'S MOST BEAUTIFUL CLASSICAL LANDSCAPES
74
AND OF AN EMBOSSED BELT ON THE SHOULDER WHICH PEOPLE THINK FINELY PAINTED BECAUSE IT IS ALL OVER LUMPS OF COLOR NOT ONE OF WHICH WAS NECESSARY
AN OUTLINE THUS PERFECTLY MADE WITH ABSOLUTE DECISION AND WITH A WASH OF ONE COLOR ABOVE IT IS THE MOST MASTERLY OF ALL METHODS OF LIGHT AND SHADE STUDY WITH LIMITED TIME WHEN THE FORMS OF THE OBJECTS TO BE DRAWN ARE CLEAR AND UNAFFECTED BY MIST
61
I SAY WHETHER COLOR BE GAY OR SAD IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
VESUVIUS IN ERUPTION
THAT ONCE HAVING ITS GLOOM DEFINED HE MAY SHOW YOU ALL THE MORE INTENSELY WHAT PASTORAL PURITY AND INNOCENCE OF LIFE AND LOVELINESS OF NATURE ARE UNDERNEATH THE BANKS AND BRAES OF DOUNE AND BY EVERY BROOKLET THAT FEEDS THE FORTH AND CLYDE
BUT HE HAD THE HIGHER GIFT IN HIM IF THE FLESH HAD NOT SUBDUED IT
138 51
THE SADNESS OF THEIR EFFECT I REPEAT
ROCKS AND WATER AND AIR MAY NO MORE BE PAINTED FOR THEIR OWN SAKES THAN THE ARMOR CARVED WITHOUT THE WARRIOR
63
NOW TAKE THE COLORIST'S VIEW OF THE MATTER
AESACUS AND HESPERIE
ANY HEAD BY TITIAN HAS TWICE THE CHARACTER AND SEEN BY DAYLIGHT INSTEAD OF GAS
THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL-DRAWN FIGURES
HERE FOR INSTANCE IS A LITTLE BIT OF SANDRO BOTTICELLI BACKGROUND
AND YET I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT TURNER BELONGS TO IT THAT ALL THE STRONGEST MEN IN TIMES OF DEVELOPED ART BELONG TO IT
HERE FOR INSTANCE IS A DRAWING WHEN HE WAS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS OLD OF DOVER CASTLE AND THE DOVER COACH
THAT DECORATIVE PURPOSE OF DAPPLING OR GREEK
27
AND FALSEHOOD MORE THAN EITHER
AND HERE THE SKETCH FROM NATURE OF DUMBLANE ABBEY FOR THE LIBER STUDIORUM WHICH SHOWS YOU WHAT HE TOOK FROM NATURE WHEN HE HAD TIME ONLY TO GET WHAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO HIM
33
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ANY OF YOU WERE INTERESTED ENOUGH IN THE LITTLE NOTE IN MY CATALOGUE ON THIS VIEW NEAR BLAIR ATHOL TO LOOK FOR THE SCENE ITSELF DURING YOUR SUMMER RAMBLES
NAY IN SOME QUALITIES OF COLOR HE HAS BEEN FAR SURPASSED BY THE VENETIANS
IN COMPLETE DRAWING ONE IS CONTINUALLY LIABLE TO BE LED ASIDE FROM THE MAIN POINTS BY PICTURESQUE ACCIDENTS OF LIGHT AND SHADE
AGAIN HERE ARE TWO SEA-PIECES BY TURNER OF THE SAME PERIOD--PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THEM AT LEAST
HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK-SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON--LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST
AND HERE I AM ABLE TO SHOW YOU FORTUNATELY ONE OF HIS WORKS PAINTED AT THIS TIME OF HIS MOST EARNEST THOUGHT
ANY OF ITS PURE OUTLINES ARE NOT ONLY WITHOUT BEAUTY BUT ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS TO GIVE YOU ANY NOTION OF ITS CHARACTER ALTHOUGH THAT CHARACTER IS IN ITSELF SO INTERESTING THAT HERE TURNER HAS MADE A PICTURE OF LITTLE MORE THAN A HEAP OF SUCH STONES WITH BLUE WATER TO OPPOSE THEIR COLOR
AND WHEN A DARK OBJECT AGAINST A LIGHT ONE INSIDE OF IT
TINTORET BEGINS WITH WHAT VENICE TAUGHT HIM AND ADOPTED WHAT ATHENS COULD TEACH
ALWAYS THINK OF THE PUBLIC AS MOLIERE OF HIS OLD WOMAN
LESS IN MERELY DRAWING SOME NATURAL OBJECT WITHOUT ATTEMPT AT COMPOSITION OR GREATER IN KNOWING ABSOLUTELY BEFOREHAND THE COMPOSITION THEY INTEND
FROM A PICTURESQUE TOUR FROM GENEVA TO MILAN
OUR UNEDUCATED MEN WORK TOO BLUNTLY TO BE EVER IN THE RIGHT
THERE A VERY LITTLE ONE OF CARPACCIO'S
AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO OBSERVE IS THAT THOUGH THE TREES COACH HORSES AND SAILORS ARE DRAWN AS ANY SCHOOLBOY WOULD DRAW THEM THE SKY IS WASHED IN SO SMOOTHLY THAT FEW WATER-COLOR PAINTERS OF OUR DAY WOULD LIGHTLY ACCEPT A CHALLENGE TO MATCH IT
THERE IS NO MORE SUBLIMITY--_PER SE_--IN GROUND SLOPED AT AN ANGLE OF FORTY-FIVE THAN IN GROUND LEVEL
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THOUGH IN THEMSELVES CLEAR
NO MAN LOSES HIS OUTLINES MORE CONSTANTLY
HIS BAT'S WINGS CANNOT LIFT HIM THEY ARE RUDIMENTARY WINGS ONLY
YOU SEE THE COUNTRY IS PERFECTLY QUIET AND INNOCENT FOR THERE IS NO TRACE OF A FENCE ANYWHERE
YOU WILL SEE HIS HAND GO TO HIS HILT FAST ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES
WELL EVERY LEAF EVERY CLOUD EVERY TOUCH IS PLACED WITH THE SAME CARE IN GREAT WORK
68
BUT I HAVE ENLARGED HERE THE PART THAT IS EXECUTED WITH THE PEN OUT OF THIS SMALLER DRAWING THAT YOU MAY SEE WITH WHAT FEARLESS STRENGTH HOLBEIN DELINEATES EVEN THE MOST DELICATE FOLDS OF THE VEIL ON THE HEAD AND OF THE LIGHT MUSLIN ON THE SHOULDERS GIVING THEM DELICACY NOT BY THE THINNESS OF HIS LINE BUT BY ITS EXQUISITE VERACITY
FOOTNOTE 2
AND THE REASON OF IT IS ALSO THAT TINTORET BELONGS WITH THE FULL HALF OF HIS MIND AS RUBENS DOES TO THE GREEK SCHOOL
FOR AS YOU DISSECT AN ANIMAL YOU GENERALLY ASSUME ITS FORM TO BE NECESSARY AND ONLY EXAMINE HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED
WHILE IF THEY ARE MERELY WHITE OR GRAY OR BLUE YOU MUST GET AN OUTLINE OF THEM WITH PENCIL
BUT IT IS ENTIRELY SECOND-RATE WORK
THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THERE ARE SO NUMEROUS AND THE SPIRITUAL ONES SO OCCULT THAT YOU ARE SURE TO BE OVERPOWERED BY THE MATERIALISM UNLESS YOUR SENTIMENT IS STRONG
HIS FINISHED WORKS PERHAPS APPEAR TO YOU MORE VAGUE THAN ANY OTHER MASTER'S
NO MAN OF ORDINARY SENSE WILL TAKE PLEASURE IN FEATURES THAT HAVE NO MEANING BUT HE MAY EASILY TAKE IT IN HEATH WOODS OR WATERFALLS THAT HAVE NO EXPRESSION
NOW HERE YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE THING DONE BY THE TWO MASTERS WE ARE SPEAKING OF
BUT BECAUSE HE IS A PURE AND HIGHLY TRAINED GREEK AS OPPOSED TO THE FLEMING'S LOW GREEK
BUT ALL THE LEARNING OF THE ACADEMIES HAS NEVER YET DRAWN SO MUCH AS ONE FAIR FACE OR EVER SET TWO PLEASANT COLORS SIDE BY SIDE
NOW THIS IS NOT BECAUSE TURNER IS A COLORIST AS OPPOSED TO THE FLEMING
ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF ITS STONY BED IS LEFT
HE COULD HAVE GOT COLOR EASILY ENOUGH IF HE HAD RESTED IN THAT
AND THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE LORD OF DEATH COMING TO YOU AS A SHEPHERD GATHERING YOU INTO HIS FOLD FOR THE NIGHT
SOMETIMES LICENTIOUS SOMETIMES TERRIFIC AND ALWAYS OBSCURE
AGAIN I THUS GIVE YOU A STATEMENT WHOLLY ADVERSE TO THE VULGAR OPINION OF HIM
BUT TURNER HAD TO WORK HIS WAY OUT OF THE DARK GREEK SCHOOL UP TO VENICE
BUT HE IS PAR EXCELLENCE A SPLENDID DRAUGHTSMAN OF THE GREEK SCHOOL
AND AGAIN A STERN AND MORE OR LESS HOPELESS MELANCHOLY NECESSARILY IS UNDER-CURRENT IN THE MINDS OF THE GREATEST MEN OF ALL AGES,--OF HOMER AESCHYLUS PINDAR OR SHAKESPEARE
WHAT YOU THINK BEAUTIFUL MAY BE IN TRUTH COMMONPLACE AND OF SMALL VALUE
HERE IS A STUDY OF SWANS FROM A DUTCH BOOK OF ACADEMICAL INSTRUCTION IN RUBENS TIME
VAN EYCK'S ADORATION OF THE LAMB AT BRUGES
FOR IT IS NOT A PICTURE EITHER OF ARGUS OR OF JUNO BUT THE PORTRAIT OF A FLEMISH LADY AS JUNO JUST AS RUBENS PAINTED HIS FAMILY PICTURE WITH HIS WIFE AS THE VIRGIN AND HIMSELF AS ST GEORGE
TURNER HAS ABSOLUTELY STRIPPED THE ROCK OF ITS BEAUTIFUL LICHENS TO BARE SLATE WITH ONE QUARTZ VEIN RUNNING UP THROUGH IT
APROSOPOS FACELESS
AND IN THAT THE DISTANCE IS STILL BEAUTIFUL BUT MISTY NOT CLEAR
YOU MIGHT MORE EASILY FILL A HOUSE WITH PICTURES LIKE CONSTABLE'S FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THAN IMITATE ONE CLUSTER OF LEAVES BY VAN EYCK OR GIOTTO
IN GOTHIC DRAWING YOU MUST GET THE CHARACTER IF AT ALL BY A KEENNESS OF ANALYSIS WHICH MUST BE IN CONSTANT EXERCISE
I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THE GREEKS AS GREEKS MADE REAL AND MATERIAL WHAT WAS BEFORE INDEFINITE
I DARESAY SOME OF YOU WHO ARE FOND OF SKETCHING HAVE GONE OUT OFTEN IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY AND YET WITH THE FEELING THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD SUBJECT TO BE FOUND IN IT
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SKETCH TO-DAY FROM THE FOREGROUND OF A VENETIAN PICTURE IN WHICH THERE IS A BIT THAT WILL SHOW YOU THIS PRECISION OF METHOD
ONCE UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU WILL SEE WHY TURNER HAS PUT HER DEATH UNDER THIS DEEP SHADE OF TREES THE SUN WITHDRAWING HIS LAST RAY
TI D'OU TIS];"[15]--A SORROWFUL AND DEGRADING LESSON
IN WHICH THE FUTURE LOVE OF MYSTERY IS EXHIBITED BY HIS STUDIOUSLY SHOWING THE WAY IN WHICH THE DUST RISES ABOUT THE WHEELS
CHOOSING FOR STUDY IN NATURAL SCENES ONLY WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG IN LIFE
THE PROJECTING ROCK WHEN I SAW IT LAST IN 1857 AND I AM CERTAIN WHEN TURNER SAW IT WAS COVERED WITH LICHENS HAVING AS MANY COLORS AS A PAINTED WINDOW
FROM THE PAINTING BY REYNOLDS 69
185 62
7
BUT RUBENS ONLY HERE AND THERE--AS FAR AS I KNOW MYSELF ONLY THIS ONCE--TOUCHES TINTORET OR GIORGIONE IN COLOR
AND HERE I MUST BEG OF YOU VERY EARNESTLY ONCE FOR ALL TO CLEAR YOUR MINDS OF ANY MISAPPREHENSION OF THE NATURE OF GOTHIC ART AS IF IT IMPLIED ERROR AND WEAKNESS INSTEAD OF SEVERITY
AFTER SKETCHING ONE DAY SEVERAL HEADS OF BIRDS IT BECAME A VITAL MATTER OF INTEREST TO ME TO KNOW THE USE OF THE BONY PROCESS ON THE HEAD OF THE HORNBILL
BUT NO ONE HAS EVER TOUCHED HIM IN EXQUISITENESS OF GRADATION
I SAY THE MAIN VIRTUE OF TURNER SPLENDID THOUGH HE BE AS A COLORIST HE IS NOT UNRIVALED IN COLOR
AND YOU WILL STILL LESS BE LIKELY TO CONCEIVE ITS NECESSARY STRICTNESS AND SEVERITY UNLESS I CONVINCE YOU OF IT BY SOMEWHAT DETAILED EXAMPLES
FOOTNOTE 10
BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT HE MEANS HIMSELF YOU MUST KNOW WHAT ALL THIS SMOKE ABOUT HIM MEANS
A PEACOCK TO HIM IS ESSENTIALLY A DARK BIRD
AND IN THE EVENTS OF THAT HISTORY A DEEP TENDERNESS OF SENTIMENT IS MINGLED WITH A CRUEL AND BARREN RIGIDITY OF HABITUAL CHARACTER ACCURATELY CORRESPONDING TO THE CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE AND EARTH
49
AND THE FUNCTION OF ANIMAL PAINTING IS TO BRING INTO NOTICE THE MINOR AND UNTHOUGHT OF CONDITIONS OF POWER OR BEAUTY AS THAT OF PHYSIOLOGY IS TO ASCERTAIN THE MINOR CONDITIONS OF ADAPTATION
THE CHARACTER IN THE FACE IS ONLY STRIKING TO PERSONS WHO LIKE CANDLE-LIGHT EFFECTS BETTER THAN SUNSHINE
THERE ARE JUST FOUR TOUCHES--FINE AS THE FINEST PENMANSHIP--TO DO THAT BEAK
AND YET YOU WILL FIND THAT IN THE PECULIAR PAROQUETTISH MUMBLING AND NIBBLING ACTION OF IT AND ALL THE CHARACTER IN WHICH THIS NIBBLING BEAK DIFFERS FROM THE TEARING BEAK OF THE EAGLE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO FARTHER OR BE MORE PRECISE
YET HOW DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN WITHOUT APPARENT CONTRADICTION
AT LEAST OF THE MORE OR LESS LIMITED DULLEST AND--I MUST NOT SAY HOMELY BUT--UNHOMELY LIFE OF THE NEGLECTED AGRICULTURAL POOR
AND OF A SUTE WERE ALL THE TOURES SUBTILY CORVEN AFTER FLOURES OF UNCOUTH COLORS DURING AYE THAT NEVER BEEN NONE SEENE IN MAY 93
WE HAVE SEEN THEN THAT EVERY SUBJECT IS TO BE TAKEN UP FIRST IN ITS TERMINAL LINES THEN IN ITS LIGHT AND SHADE THEN IN ITS COLOR
ILLUSTRATION 19
BUT ABOVE ALL KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT THE LIGHT IS AND WHERE IT IS.[3 FOOTNOTE 3
BOTH THESE ARE REMAINS OF THE PAST
AND THE CIMA OF THE PURE COLOR SCHOOL OF VENICE
AND THOUGH PART OF THE SUBJECT IS IN DEEP SHADOW THE EYE AT ONCE CATCHES THE ONE BLACK POINT ADMITTED IN FRONT
THE LAYING OF PAINT BY AN INSENSITIVE PERSON WHATEVER IT ENDEAVORS TO REPRESENT IS NOT PAINTING BUT DAUBING OR PLASTERING
THEY ARE TWO PIECES OF STUDY OF THE COLOR OF MARBLE ARCHITECTURE THE TINTS LITERALLY EDIFIED AND LAID EDGE TO EDGE AS SIMPLY ON THE PAPER AS THE STONES ARE ON THE WALLS
11
AND IN THE FOREGROUND LIES THE DEAD BODY OF PROCRIS WHICH DISTURBS THE POOR PAINTER GREATLY
54
FOR INSTANCE TWO LANDSCAPE-PAINTERS OF MUCH REPUTATION IN ENGLAND AND ONE OF THEM IN FRANCE ALSO--DAVID COX AND JOHN CONSTABLE REPRESENT A FORM OF BLUNT AND UNTRAINED FACULTY WHICH IN BEING VERY FRANK AND SIMPLE APPARENTLY POWERFUL AND NEEDING NO THOUGHT INTELLIGENCE OR TROUBLE WHATEVER TO OBSERVE AND BEING WHOLLY DISORDERLY SLOVENLY AND LICENTIOUS AND THEREIN MEETING WITH INSTANT SYMPATHY FROM THE DISORDERLY PUBLIC MIND NOW RESENTFUL OF EVERY TRAMMEL AND IGNORANT OF EVERY LAW--THESE TWO MEN I SAY REPRESENT IN THEIR INTENSITY THE QUALITIES ADVERSE TO ALL ACCURATE SCIENCE OR SKILL IN LANDSCAPE ART
I SHOWED YOU IN THIS DRAWING AT LAST LECTURE HOW TRULY HE HAD MATCHED THE COLOR OF THE IRON-STAINED ROCKS IN THE BED OF THE TICINO
WHAT THE EXECUTION OF THAT DRAWING IS YOU MAY JUDGE BY LOOKING WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS AT THE IVY AND BATTLEMENTS IN THIS WHEN ALSO HIS CUE IS MASONRY
TO-DAY I WISH TO SHOW YOU THAT HIS PREEMINENCE DEPENDS SECONDARILY ON HIS PERFECT RENDERING OF FORM AND DISTANCE BY LIGHT AND SHADE BEFORE HE ADMITS A THOUGHT OF COLOR
NOW THOUGH--EVEN IF WE HAD GIVEN TEN MINUTES OF DIGRESSION--THE LESSONS IN THIS PICTURE WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL WORTH IT I HAVE NOT IN TAKING YOU TO IT GONE OUT OF MY OWN WAY
ANGLE SUBTENDED BY PICTURE AND DISTANCE OF NEAREST OBJECT IN IT 17
AND THE IMBECILITIES AND LASSITUDES WHICH FOLLOW CRIME BOTH IN NATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN ONLY FIND A LAST STIMULUS TO THEIR OWN DYING SENSATION IN THE FASCINATED CONTEMPLATION OF COMPLETER DEATH
NOW LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THE DRAGON MEANS HIMSELF
THERE IS ONE PART OF THIS PICTURE WHICH HE LEARNED HOW TO DO AT VENICE THE IRIS WITH THE GOLDEN HAIR IN THE CHARIOT BEHIND JUNO
TWO COUNTRY BOYS LEAN JOYLESS AGAINST A WALL THAT IS HALF BROKEN DOWN
IT MAKES US OBSERVE THE VITAL POINTS IN WHICH CHARACTER CONSISTS AND EDUCATES THE EYE AND MIND IN THE HABIT OF FASTENING AND LIMITING THEMSELVES TO ESSENTIALS
HE HAS QUIETED THE RIVER INTO A COMMONPLACE STREAM
SIMILARLY THOSE OF YOU WHO IN YOUR LONG VACATIONS HAVE EVER STAYED NEAR DUMBLANE WILL BE I THINK DISAPPOINTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE BY THIS STUDY OF THE ABBEY FOR WHICH I SHOWED YOU THE SKETCH AT LAST LECTURE
DRAWING
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER 36
THE STREAM AT THE BOTTOM IS ROCKY INDEED BUT ITS ROCKS ARE MEAN FLAT AND OF A DULL YELLOW COLOR
BUT AS A RULE FROM HIS BOYHOOD TO THE LAST DAY OF HIS LIFE HE SKETCHED ONLY WITH THE FINE PENCIL POINT AND ALWAYS THE OUTLINE MORE IF HE HAD TIME BUT AT LEAST THE OUTLINE OF EVERY SCENE THAT INTERESTED HIM
THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE WAS THE LEAST COAL SMOKE
FIRST THAT IT IS WHITE
AND THE WILD VEGETATION IN THE ROCK CRANNIES WAS A FINISHED ARABESQUE OF LIVING SCULPTURE OF WHICH THIS STUDY OF MINE MADE ON ANOTHER STREAM IN GLENFINLAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY WILL GIVE YOU A FAIR IDEA
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE--FIGHT HIM--CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY
IS IT THEN TO BE OUTLINED
ILLUSTRATION 39
WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU IN NEXT LECTURE
IT IS ALL THAT THE GREAT COLORISTS NEED FOR THEIR STUDIES
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER IN THE PUREST LANDSCAPE THE HUMAN SUBJECT IS THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL BY THE FAITHFULNESS OF LOVE
HE ALWAYS THINKS OF HIS SHADOW FIRST
THEY ARE NEARLY BLACK OR BLACK-GREEN PEACOCKS
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN I HAVE TO RECOMMEND YOU TO DRAW ALWAYS AS IF YOU WERE ENGRAVING AND AS IF THE LINE COULD NOT BE CHANGED
AS FOR THE MOST PART CLOUDS FOAM AND THE LIKE
THE ONE IS THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF HESPERIA TO AESACUS:[13 ASPICIT HESPERIEN PATRIA CEBRENIDA RIPA INJECTOS HUMERIS SICCANTEM SOLE CAPILLOS IN A FEW MOMENTS TO LOSE HER FOREVER
THUS YOU KNOW IN YOUR STUDY OF SCULPTURE WE SAW THAT THE ESSENTIAL AIM OF THE GREEK ART WAS TRANQUIL ACTION
HE IS DRESSED NEITHER IN A RAINBOW NOR BEDRAGGLED WITH BLOOD
NOR THIS LAVA STREAM TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE OPERATION OF GRAVITY ON PONDEROUS AND VISCOUS MATERIALS
THESE LECTURES ON LANDSCAPE WERE GIVEN AT OXFORD ON JANUARY 20 FEBRUARY 9 AND FEBRUARY 23 1871
IF AFTERWARDS I CAN MAKE THEM LOOK ROUND OR LIKE FRUIT AND LEAVES IT'S ALL VERY WELL
THUS YOU SEE HERE IS ONE OF SIR JOSHUA'S FIRST SITTINGS
ALSO OBSERVE THAT THOUGH WHEN YOU ARE MASTER OF YOUR ART YOU MAY MODIFY YOUR OUTLINE BY MAKING IT DARK IN SOME PARTS LIGHT IN OTHERS AND EVEN SOMETIMES THICK AND SOMETIMES SLENDER A SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE OUTLINE IS PERFECTLY EQUAL THROUGHOUT
AND NOW DO YOU SEE WHY I GAVE YOU FOR THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TYPES OF LANDSCAPE THOUGHT THAT JUNCTION OF TEES AND GRETA IN THEIR MISTY RAVINES
32
172 TO BE ASSURED NOT MERELY OF THEIR SUPERIORITY BUT OF THEIR ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE IN KIND FROM PHOTOGRAPHY AS WORKS OF DISCIPLINED DESIGN
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES AND INSUFFICIENCIES MOST LANDSCAPE-PAINTERS HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO NEGLECT OUTLINE ALTOGETHER AND THINK ONLY OF EFFECTS OF LIGHT OR COLOR ON MASSES MORE OR LESS OBSCURELY DEFINED
A CLOUD LOOKED AT AS A CLOUD ONLY IS NO MORE A SUBJECT FOR PAINTING THAN SO MUCH FECULENCE IN DIRTY WATER
NEXT HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES EVER PAINTED THE BEST I HAVE NEXT TO THE GRETA AND TEES
AND LANDSCAPE-PAINTING HAS THEREFORE MORE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ONE ERROR THAN OF ANY OTHER BECOME WEAK FRIVOLOUS AND JUSTLY DESPISED
THE OTHER IS A MYTHOLOGICAL SUBJECT OF DEEPER MEANING THE DEATH OF PROCRIS
HE HAS GIVEN OF ALL THE RICH VEGETATION ONLY ONE CLUSTER OF QUITE UNINTERESTING LEAVES AND A CLUMP OF BIRCHES WITH RAGGED TRUNKS
130 22
THAT CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION AND THE LOATHSOME SPRAWLING OF THE TRUNK OF ARGUS UNDER THE CHARIOT ARE THE ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF RUBENS OWN NETHERLAND PERSONALITY
THEY WOULD THINK IT WASTED TIME TO GO FARTHER
ONLY REMEMBER THIS THAT HOLBEIN AND TURNER ARE GREEK CHIAROSCURISTS NEARLY PERFECT BY ADOPTED COLOR
13
THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SCHOOLS OF ART WHICH I HAVE SO OFTEN ASKED YOU TO OBSERVE ARE YOU MUST BE AWARE FOUNDED ONLY ON THE EXCESS OF CERTAIN QUALITIES IN ONE GROUP OF PAINTERS OVER ANOTHER OR THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR TENDENCIES
THAT IT IS WORTHY OF BEING PAINTED AT ALL DEPENDS UPON ITS BEING THE MEANS OF NOURISHMENT AND CHASTISEMENT TO MEN OR THE DWELLING PLACE OF IMAGINARY GODS
AND THE WIND IS WORTH THINKING OF ONLY BECAUSE IT FILLS THE SAILS OF SHIPS AND THE SUN BECAUSE IT WARMS THE SAILORS
IT IS SO NATURAL TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MAIN INTEREST OF LANDSCAPE IS ESSENTIALLY IN ROCKS AND WATER AND SKY
AND NO ONE IN LANDSCAPE IN PERFECT RENDERING OF ORGANIC FORM
WHEREVER YOU SEE ONE SPACE OF COLOR DISTINGUISHED FROM ANOTHER BY A SHARP LIMIT YOU ARE TO DRAW THAT LIMIT FIRMLY
IN THE EMBROIDERY OF JUNO'S ROBE YOU HAVE THE DAEDALUS-GREEK PART OF IT BROUGHT DOWN TO RUBENS THROUGH VERONESE
BUT AN EARTHY SENSUAL AND WEAK DESPONDENCY IS THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE LOWEST MENTAL AND BODILY DISEASE
TO THE END OF LIFE INDEED THE STRENGTH OF A MAN'S FINEST NATURE IS SHOWN IN DUE CONTINENCE
415 IN THE SAME EXHIBITION 60
BUT THE PARROT'S HEAD HOWEVER BADLY DONE IS PUT DOWN WITH NO MORE TOUCHES THAN THE VENETIAN GAVE IT AND IT WILL SHOW YOU EXACTLY HIS METHOD
IT IS NOTHING BUT A GRASS BANK WITH SOME NOT VERY PRETTY TREES SCATTERED OVER IT WHOLLY WITHOUT GROUPING
II
THAT IN HIGHER FIELDS OF THOUGHT INCREASING KNOWLEDGE MEANS INCREASING SORROW AND EVERY ART WHICH HAS COMPLETE SYMPATHY WITH HUMANITY MUST BE CHASTENED BY THE SIGHT AND OPPRESSED BY THE MEMORY OF PAIN
BUT WE HAVE NOW TO DEAL WITH LIMITS OF A MORE SUBTLE KIND
I USED IT FOR A CHIEF EXAMPLE IN MY LECTURES AT EDINBURGH
NOW IN THIS OF BURNE-JONES THE LANDSCAPE IS CLEARLY FULL OF LIGHT EVERYWHERE COLOR OR GLASS LIGHT
HIS SHOULDERS LIKE ITS PINNACLES
HE HAS LABORIOUSLY ENGRAVED EVERY FEATHER AND HAS ROUNDED THE BIRD INTO A BALL
THE OUTLINE OF ANY SIMPLE SOLID FORM EVEN THOUGH IT MAY HAVE COMPLEX PARTS REPRESENTS AN ACTUAL LIMIT ACCURATELY TO BE FOLLOWED
FROM THE BEGINNING HE WORKED OUT OF DOORS WITH THE POINT BUT INDOORS WITH THE BRUSH
9
BUT IF I CAN ENGAGE YOU IN AN ENDEAVOR TO DRAW ITS TRUE FORMS IN LIGHT AND SHADE YOU WILL MOST ASSUREDLY FIND IT NOT ONLY INTERESTING BUT IN SOME POINTS QUITE BEYOND THE MOST SUBTLE SKILL YOU CAN GIVE TO IT
THEY WERE ILLUSTRATED BY PICTURES FROM HIS COLLECTION OF WHICH SEVERAL ARE HERE REPRODUCED AND BY OTHERS WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY GALLERIES OR IN THE RUSKIN DRAWING SCHOOL W.G.C CONTENTS
A PIECE OF BACKGROUND IS PUT IN ROUND IT
HERE AGAIN IS A LITTLE BIT TO SHOW CARPACCIO'S EXECUTION
BOTH TINTORET AND VERONESE WHEN THEY PAINT ON DARK GROUNDS CONTINUALLY STOP SHORT WITH THEIR TINTS JUST BEFORE THEY TOUCH OTHERS LEAVING THE DARK GROUND SHOWING BETWEEN IN A NARROW BAR
BUT IN DRAWING THE OUTER FORM ITSELF ATTENTIVELY YOU ARE LED NECESSARILY TO CONSIDER THE MODE OF LIFE FOR WHICH IT IS DISPOSED AND THEREFORE TO BE STRUCK BY ANY AWKWARDNESS OR APPARENT USELESSNESS IN ITS PARTS
YOU RECOLLECT THOSE QUIET WORDS OF THE STRONGEST OF ALL SHAKESPEARE'S HEROES WHEN ANY ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD HIS SWORD OUT IN AN INSTANT
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PAINT ANYWHERE OF ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPE SUBJECT AS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD
THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER--THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT THAT'S WHAT THE CLOUD AND FLAME OF THE DRAGON MEAN
NOW IF YOU WILL LOOK BACK TO MY FIFTH LECTURE[9 YOU WILL FIND IT SAID THAT THE COLORISTS CAN ALWAYS ADOPT AS MUCH CHIAROSCURO AS SUITS THEM AND SO BECOME PERFECT
LIGHT AND SHADE 16 LECTURE III
THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER THE WILD COPSE WOOD AND THE RUIN TAKE YOU BACK INTO THE LIFE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
GREEK SOFTNESS OF DIFFUSED SHADOW AND DUCTILE CURVE AGAINST GOTHIC LUCIDITY OF COLOR AND ACUTENESS OF ANGLE
DON'T GET ARTIST-LIKE QUALITIES FOR HIM
YOU WILL SEE THE EXPLANATORY OFFICE OF SUCH LINES BY PLACING THIS OUTLINE OVER MY DRAWING OF THE STONE UNTIL THE LINES COINCIDE WITH THE LIMITS OF THE SHADOW
THE INTENSITY THE ABSTRACTION THE FORCE OF CHARACTER ARE AND THE BEAUTY OF COLOR
HER FORM IS SEEN EVERYWHERE DEFINED AGAINST THE LIGHT BY A PERFECTLY SHARP LINEAR LIMIT WHICH HOLBEIN CAN ACCURATELY DRAW WITH HIS PEN
IT IS VERY EASY TO ROUND A DRAGON'S NECK IF THE ONLY IDEA YOU HAVE OF IT IS THAT IT IS VIRTUALLY NO MORE THAN A COILED SAUSAGE
AND ANGLE OF THE LIGHT WITH RESPECT TO IT
YET GOTHIC RIGIDITY GREEK
PUT ALL THAT OUT OF YOUR HEADS AT ONCE
PUBLISHED BY R
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO EYE FOR COLOR YOU MAY GO FARTHER IN ANOTHER MANNER WITH ENJOYMENT
TURNER 47 L'AIGUILLETTE
IN THIS DRAWING OF HOLBEIN'S THE HAND BEING SEEN AGAINST THE LIGHT THE OUTLINE GOES INSIDE THE CONTOUR OF THE FINGERS
DUMBLANE ABBEY--TOWER AND AISLES AND ALL--WOULD GO UNDER ONE OF THE ARCHES OF BUILDINGS SUCH AS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD
BOTH ARE WHITE

43
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOTES ON THE VENETIAN PICTURES IN THE END OF MY STONES OF VENICE YOU WILL FIND IT ESPECIALLY DWELT UPON AS SINGULAR THAT TINTORET IN HIS PICTURE OF THE NATIVITY HAS A PEACOCK WITHOUT ANY COLOR IN IT
TO SHOW HOW CLEAR IT IS TURNER HAS PUT THE ONLY PIECE OF PLAYING COLOR IN ALL THE PICTURE INTO THE REFLECTIONS IN THIS
HOW IT IS OBTAINED BY VARIOUS INCIDENTS IN THE DRAWING OF STONES AND TREES AND FIGURES I WILL SHOW YOU ANOTHER TIME
SCARCELY ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT HEAD OR MORE MASTERLY THAN THE COMPOSITION OF IT WITH THE INLAID PATTERN OF JUNO'S ROBE BELOW EXISTS IN THE ART OF ANY COUNTRY
FOOTNOTE 15
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT HIS FRANKNESS IN LOSING DEPENDS ON HIS CERTAINTY OF FINDING IF HE CHOOSES
THE WATER HAS CUT ITS WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SOFT ALLUVION OF AN ELEVATED PLAIN TO THE LIMESTONE ROCK AT THE BOTTOM
IF YOU WOULD NOT RATHER HAVE THE REAL THING THAN YOUR SKETCH OF IT YOU ARE NOT IN A RIGHT STATE OF MIND FOR SKETCHING AT ALL
TURNER 45 MILL NEAR GRANDE CHARTREUSE BY J.M.W
YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN--TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET--IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
AND ALSO CARPACCIO DOES IT WITH A TOUCH WITH ONE SWEEP OF HIS BRUSH
AND SECONDLY IN THE PERFECT ROUNDING AND CLEAVING OF THE MASSES ALIKE OF MOUNTAIN AND STONE
THE SENTIMENT THOUGH CHILDISH DEEP AND PURE
WHAT YOU THINK UNIMPORTANT IN IT MAY TO ANOTHER PERSON BE THE MOST TOUCHING PART OF IT
44
AND SO FAR INDEED IT IS GOTHIC ENOUGH
SO-CALLED I SAY
72
SECONDLY
YOU KNOW THE BACCHIC CHORUS OF OLD MEN IN PLATO'S LAWS
I DWELL ON THE NECESSITY OF COMPLETION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I HAVE LOST MUCH TIME MYSELF FROM MY SYMPATHY WITH THE FEVERISH INTENSITY OF THE MINDS OF THE GREAT ENGRAVERS
AND ALL ABOUT THE STEPS DOWN WHICH THE GIRL IS BRINGING HER SHEAF THE BANK OF EARTH FLOWERLESS AND RUGGED TESTIFIES ONLY OF ITS MALIGNITY
70
IN THE ENGRAVING OF MELANCHOLY WHAT I MEANT BY TELLING YOU IT WAS IN FORMAL CHIAROSCURO WAS THAT THE BALL IS WHITE THE LEAVES ARE WHITE THE DRESS IS WHITE
NOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE CHANCED TO NOTICE AT THE END OF MY QUEEN OF THE AIR MY SAYING THAT IN LANDSCAPE TURNER MUST BE YOUR ONLY GUIDE YOU PERHAPS HAVE THOUGHT I SAID SO BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT POWER IN MELTING COLORS OR IN MASSING LIGHT AND SHADE
THE BROOK DISTILLED FROM IT AS THE TYPE OF HUMAN LIFE BORN OF THE CLOUD AND VANISHING INTO THE CLOUD LED DOWN BY THE HAUNTING HERMES AMONG THE RAVINES
MEASUREMENT AND PRECISION ARE WITH ME BEFORE ALL THINGS
AND HAVING IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR LAID THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS OF ART SUFFICIENTLY BEFORE YOU I WILL INVITE YOU NOW TO ENTER ON REAL WORK WITH ME
BUT I ONLY KNOW THOROUGHLY GOOD LANDSCAPE IN ONE BOOK
YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT COLOR ANY OF THESE STAND FOR
L'AIGUILLETTE VALLEY OF CLUSES
BUT FIRST GIVE HIM THE PLEASANT SENSATION OF BEING AT THE PLACE THEN SHOW HIM HOW THE LAND LIES HOW THE WATER RUNS HOW THE WIND BLOWS AND SO ON
AND SOME REST IN THE SHADE AND TWO IN THE WATER
LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL FIND THEY ARE THE DARK GROUND LEFT BETWEEN TWO TINTS BROUGHT CLOSE TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT TOUCHING
BUT OF HUMAN LIFE HE SAYS A BOY CLIMBING AMONG THE TREES FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE AND THESE WHITE STONES IN THE MOUNTAIN CHURCHYARD SHOW FORTH ALL THE STRENGTH AND ALL THE END
TURNER TAKES ONE BRUSH IN HIS RIGHT HAND WITH A LITTLE WHITE IN IT
AND THEREFORE PRIMARILY THEY MUST BE ABLE TO DIVIDE
PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST--"APOLLO AND THE PYTHON NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO--TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL
THE INTEREST OF A LANDSCAPE CONSISTS WHOLLY IN ITS RELATION EITHER TO FIGURES PRESENT--OR TO FIGURES PAST--OR TO HUMAN POWERS CONCEIVED
IF I WERE TO ASK YOU TO PAINT IT THOUGH ITS COLOR IS PLEASANT ENOUGH YOU WOULD STILL FIND IT UNINTERESTING AND COARSE COMPARED TO THAT OF A FLOWER OR A BIRD
SO THAT THE DEFECT OF COLOR AND SUBSTITUTION OF MORE OR LESS GRAY OR GLOOMY EFFECTS OF ROUNDED GRADATION CONSTANTLY EXPRESS THE TWO CHARACTERS
AN INSENSITIVE PERSON WILL DAUB WITH A CAMEL'S HAIR-BRUSH AND ULTRAMARINE
AND YOU KNOW THAT THE LANCET WINDOWS IN THEIR FINE PROPORTION AND RUGGED MASONRY WOULD ALONE FORM A STUDY OF RUINED GOTHIC MASONRY OF EXQUISITE INTEREST
THE OTHER THE WRECK OF AN INDIAMAN
IT IS FIRST IN THE EXPRESSION OF ENORMOUS SCALE OF MOUNTAIN AND SPACE OF AIR BY GRADATIONS OF SHADE IN THESE COLORS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE
48
BUT THEY ARE VIVIDLY PURPLE SPOTS THEIR WHOLE VITALITY AND USE IN THE DESIGN IS IN THEIR TYRIAN NATURE
BUT SECONDLY
FOOTNOTE 13
AND THIS IS ONLY AN INCIDENT REMEMBER IN A LARGE PICTURE
28
AND TO REST IN THEM AS LONG AS YOU CAN
AND IN YOUR FIRST PRACTICE I WISH YOU TO USE ALWAYS A PEN WITH A BLUNT POINT WHICH WILL MAKE NO HAIR STROKE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS
OF COURSE I CANNOT DO SO MYSELF
BUT A QUITE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE MASTERS OF THE PURE GREEK SCHOOL DID IN FLORENCE
55
57
86
BUT PRACTICALLY WHEN YOU ARE OUTLINING A LIGHT OBJECT DEFINED AGAINST A DARK ONE THE LINE MUST GO OUTSIDE OF IT
THEY HAVE THUS GRADUALLY LOST THEIR SENSE OF ORGANIC FORM THEIR PRECISION OF HAND AND THEIR RESPECT FOR LIMITING LAW
LONDON
STASIS OF GREEK
BUT FOR THE REST--LEARN TO PAINT EVERYTHING IN THE QUIETEST AND SIMPLEST LIGHT
58
IN MANY OF THE FINEST WORKS OF COLOR ON A LARGE SCALE THERE IS EVEN SOME ADMISSION OF THE QUALITY GIVEN TO A PAINTED WINDOW BY THE DARK LEAD BARS BETWEEN THE PIECES OF GLASS
AND IN THE BLACK AND STERNLY RUGGED ETCHING--NO LONGER GRACEFUL BUT HARD AND BROKEN IN EVERY TOUCH--THE MASTER INSISTS UPON THE ANCIENT CURSE OF THE EARTH--"THORNS ALSO AND THISTLES SHALL IT BRING FORTH TO THEE 97
AND THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GRADATE OR CHANGE IT IN ANY WAY OR DEGREE WHATSOEVER
THE REMBRANDT OF THE DEBASED GREEK SCHOOL IN HOLLAND
BUT THEY BROKE THEMSELVES TO PIECES BY PURSUING DRAMATIC SENSATION INSTEAD OF BEAUTY
THE OBSERVATION IS ACCURATE
BUT TURNER IS TRUE GREEK FOR HE IS THINKING ONLY OF THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SWAN
THE MORE RECENT PICTURES OF THE PAINTER GEROME UNITE ALL THESE ATTRIBUTES IN A SINGULAR DEGREE
HERE ARE TWO LANDSCAPES BY TURNER IN HIS GREATEST TIME--VESUVIUS IN REPOSE VESUVIUS IN ERUPTION
THE SCENE IS ONE WHICH IN OLD TIMES OF SWISS TRAVELING YOU WOULD ALL HAVE KNOWN WELL
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND I WROTE TO HIM THAT THEIR FIRST LESSON WILL BE IN OBSERVING NOT WHAT TURNER HAS DONE BUT WHAT HE HAS NOT DONE
THE HEAD IS VERY NEARLY DONE WITH THE FIRST COLOR
AND IT IMPRESSED TURNER PROFOUNDLY
ONLY OBSERVE THE CHIAROSCURO IS SIMPLY THE TECHNICAL RESULT OF THE TWO OTHERS
THEN ON THIS HE STRIKES HIS PARROT IN VERMILION ALMOST FLAT COLOR
QUIETLY COMPLETE EACH PART TO THE BEST OF YOUR POWER ENDEAVORING TO MAINTAIN A STEADY AND DUTIFUL ENERGY AND THE TRANQUIL PLEASURE OF A WORKMAN
BUT NO
AND NOW I MAY SAFELY I THINK GO INTO OUR WORK OF TO-DAY WITHOUT CONFUSING YOU EXCEPT ONLY IN THIS
HERE IS THE MOST ORDINARY COMPONENT OF A FOREGROUND FOR INSTANCE A PLEASANTLY COLORED STONE
BUT THEY ARE NOT PAINTED FOR THOSE QUALITIES
AND THEN LIKE THE REFLECTION OF THE CLOUD ITSELF THE WHITE SHEEP WITH THE DOG OF ARGUS GUARDING THEM DRINKING FROM THE STREAM
AND IT HELD HIM IN SOME DEGREE FATALLY TO THE END
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PLACING EVERY LEAF IN A TREE THE PAINTER GETS TIRED
REALIST AS OPPOSED TO GOTHIC IMAGINATION
AND IT IS NOT TURNER'S OBJECT AT ALL TO EXHIBIT OR ILLUSTRATE NATURAL PHENOMENA HOWEVER INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES
SEE THAT WHEN IT DRAWS NEAR TO YOU YOU MAY LOOK TO IT AT LEAST FOR SWEETNESS OF REST
TO HIM THE FIRST MAIN FACTS ABOUT THE SWAN ARE THAT IT IS A WHITE THING WITH BLACK SPOTS
AND A GOOD ANATOMICAL STUDY OF A HUMAN BODY AS ARGUS
ONE COW IS WHITE ANOTHER WHITE AND RED EVIDENTLY AS CLEAN AS MORNING DEW CAN WASH THEIR SIDES
HE WAS NOT ENOUGH A COLORIST EITHER TO CATCH THE POINTS OF THE CREATURE'S ASPECT OR TO FEEL THE SAME HATRED OF THEM
AND YET BEING IN ALL THINGS SET UPON ABSOLUTE VERACITY AND REALIZATION THEY PERCEIVE AS THEY WORK AND THINK FORWARD THAT TO SEE IN ALL THINGS TRULY IS TO SEE IN ALL THINGS DIMLY AND THROUGH HIDING OF CLOUD AND FIRE
THERE ARE VERY FEW PERSONS IN THE ROOM WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE DRAWING OF THIS BIRD'S BEAK WITHOUT A MAGNIFYING-GLASS
812
IT MUST BE DONE THAT IS TO SAY WITH STRENGTH AND DEPTH OF SOUL
21
BUT THIS PEACOCK BEING DRAWN WITH INTENSE DELIGHT IN BLUE ON GOLD AND GETTING CHARACTER OF PEACOCK IN THE GENERAL SHARP OUTLINE INSTEAD OF--AS RUBENS PEACOCKS--IN BLACK SHADOW IS DISTINCTIVELY GOTHIC OF FINE STYLE
IT MAY BE EVEN SO THAT WHAT THEY INTEND THOUGH BETTER KNOWN IS NOT SO GOOD:--BUT AT ALL EVENTS IN THIS ANTICIPATING POWER TINTORET HOLBEIN AND TURNER STAND I THINK ALONE AS DRAUGHTSMEN
GREEK MOTION AGAINST GOTHIC ABSOLUTE QUIETNESS
BUT NOW OBSERVE
AND THIS GLEN OF THE GRETA ABOVE IN WHICH TURNER HAS INDEED DONE HIS BEST TO PAINT THE TREES THAT LIVE AGAIN AFTER THEIR AUTUMN--THE TWILIGHT THAT WILL RISE AGAIN WITH TWILIGHT OF DAWN--THE STREAM THAT FLOWS ALWAYS AND THE RESTING ON THE CLIFFS OF THE CLOUDS THAT RETURN IF THEY VANISH
BUT LOOK HERE AT CARPACCIO EVEN IN MY COPY
DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELVES WITH OR ALLOW YOURSELVES TO BE TEMPTED BY ANY EFFECTS THAT ARE BRILLIANT OR TREMENDOUS
THE WEST WINDOW OF CHARTRES IS BEDROPPED WITH CRIMSON DEEPER THAN BLOOD
THAT IS RUBENS OWN
SO THAT IF YOU GET ONCE THE RIGHT CLUE TO ANY GROUP OF THEM IT WILL GRASP THE SIMPLEST YET REACH TO THE HIGHEST TRUTHS
THAT DESTRUCTION AND DECAY ARE ACCIDENTS OF OUR PRESENT STATE NEVER TO BE THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND ABOVE ALL THINGS NEVER TO BE PAINTED
I SAY BEFORE HOWEVER--OBSERVE CAREFULLY--ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANY GIVEN PICTURE NOT WITH REFERENCE TO THE ORDER IN WHICH HE LEARNT HIS MECHANICAL PROCESSES
YOU ARE NEITHER TO BE ALARMED NOR ENTERTAINED BY ANYTHING THAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO HIM
GENIUS HAS SOMETIMES DONE LOVELY THINGS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT DISCIPLINE
ENDEAVORS THAT IS TO SAY TO GET THE UTMOST RESULT POSSIBLE WITH THE SIMPLEST MEANS
YOU CAN SAY OF THAT LINE EITHER IT IS WRONG OR RIGHT
NONE OF THIS BRIGHT GOTHIC ART WAS EVER DONE BUT EITHER BY FAITH IN THE ATTAINABLENESS OF FELICITY IN HEAVEN OR UNDER CONDITIONS OF REAL ORDER AND DELICATE LOVELINESS ON THE EARTH
HERE A BUNCH OF BLACK GRAPES
HERE THEN IS THE ACADEMICAL DUTCHMAN'S NOTION OF A SWAN
FROM THE PAINTING BY FILIPPO LIPPI 64
ON THE CONTRARY TO A COLORIST THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT EVERYTHING IS ITS COLOR
THE STREAM--OR RATHER POWERFUL AND DEEP HIGHLAND RIVER THE TILT--FOAMED AND EDDIED MAGNIFICENTLY THROUGH THE NARROWED CHANNEL
NOW IT FALLS WITHIN THE COMPASS OF ORDINARY APPLICATION TO PLACE RIGHTLY ALL THE FOLDS OF DRAPERY OR GLEAMS OF LIGHT ON A CHAIN OR ORNAMENTS IN A PATTERN
THERE'S A BIT OF BLUE SKY AND CLOUD BY TURNER--ONE OF THE LOVELIEST EVER PAINTED BY HUMAN HAND
BUT NONE BUT THE STRONGEST--JOHN BELLINI TITIAN VELASQUEZ TINTORET MANTEGNA SANDRO BOTTICELLI CARPACCIO AND TURNER--HAVE EVER PAINTED A FRAGMENT OF GOOD LANDSCAPE
20
THE SECOND WAS THEIR EXTREME MODESTY IN COLOR
TWELVE ANGELS HALF FLOAT HALF DANCE IN A CIRCLE ROUND THE LOWER VAULT OF IT
31
42
BUT PLEASANT AND USEFUL LANDSCAPE YES
SO THAT USING BLACK INK AND ONLY ONE MOVEMENT OF THE PEN NOT RETURNING TO THICKEN YOUR LINE YOU SHALL EITHER HAVE YOUR LINE THERE OR NOT THERE
FOOTNOTE 6
THE SKY IS GRAY AND SHAPELESS
ALL THESE OPPOSITIONS ARE LIABLE TO INFINITE QUALIFICATION AND GRADATION AS BETWEEN SPECIES OF ANIMALS
I SAID LANDSCAPE IS TO BE A PASSIONATE REPRESENTATION OF THESE THINGS
I WISH YOU THEREFORE TO BEGIN YOUR STUDY OF NATURAL HISTORY AND LANDSCAPE BY DISCERNING THE SIMPLE OUTLINES AND THE PLEASANT COLORS OF THINGS
AND HE PUTS A LITTLE PATCH OF THE YELLOW GOWN THAT IS TO BE AT THE SIDE
THE METHOD USED BY TURNER IN THE LIBER STUDIORUM IS PRECISELY ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF HOLBEIN
WELL GREAT LANDSCAPE CERTAINLY NOT
THEY ALWAYS THINK OF COLOR FIRST
AND EVEN IN THINGS WHICH HAVE DETERMINATE FORM THE OUTLINE OF THAT FORM IS USUALLY QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING THEIR REAL CHARACTER
GREEK-SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS
NOW I WANT YOU ESPECIALLY TO NOTICE WITH RESPECT TO THESE THINGS TURNER'S INTRODUCTION OF THE UGLY SQUARE TOWER HIGH UP ON THE LEFT
HERE IS A VERY IMPERFECT BUT ILLUSTRATIVE BORDER OF FLOWERS AND ANIMALS ON A GOLDEN GROUND
BUT THE DISTORTION IS NOT GOTHIC
THAT AS APPLIED TO LANDSCAPE IT ASSUMES THAT ALL NATURE IS LOVELY AND MAY BE CLEARLY SEEN
SEE THEN HOW THE PICTURE DIVIDES ITSELF
WELL THE REASON OF THAT IS THAT RUBENS IS NOT PAR EXCELLENCE A COLORIST
87
THE BACKGROUND GOLD THE TREES DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF AND FULL GREEN IN COLOR--NO EFFECT OF LIGHT
I HAVE LIMITED YOU HAVE JUST HEARD LANDSCAPE PAINTING TO THE REPRESENTATION OF PHENOMENA RELATING TO HUMAN LIFE
FOR TO THE WHOLE BODY OF POWERFUL DRAUGHTSMEN THE REFORMATION MEANT THE GREEK SCHOOL AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH
SERPENT-LIKE IN THE WRITHING OF THE NECK CLOUD-LIKE IN THE TOSS AND WAVE OF ITS PLUMES
AND FROM ALL THE WORKS OF VARIOUSLY STRAINED AND OBTRUSIVE POWER WITH WHICH IT IS SURROUNDED YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU NEVER RETURN TO IT BUT WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF AND OF PEACE WHICH CAN ONLY BE GIVEN YOU BY THE TENDER SKILL WHICH IS WHOLLY WITHOUT PRETENSE WITHOUT PRIDE AND WITHOUT ERROR
THE CHIEF ELEMENT IN BOTH IS THE SADNESS AND DEPTH OF THEIR EFFECT OF SUBDUED THOUGH CLEAR LIGHT IN SKY AND STREAM
DOWN MUST GO MY TOUCH OF WHITE GREEN OR DARK BLUE FIRST OF ALL
75
AND THAT FIGURES ARE TO BE PUT LIKE THE SALT AND MUSTARD TO A DISH ONLY TO GIVE IT A FLAVOR
170 ILLUSTRATION
FARTHER THAT HE NEVER BECAME A GREAT COLORIST DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE COULD NOT HAD HE CHOSEN
BUT THOUGH THE VIRTUE OF ALL PAINTING AND SIMILARLY OF SCULPTURE AND EVERY OTHER ART IS IN PASSION I MUST NOT HAVE YOU BEGIN BY WORKING PASSIONATELY
MAKE A NOTE OF THESE POINTS
88
A GREEK PAINTER LIKES LIGHT AND SHADE FIRST BECAUSE THEY ENABLE HIM TO REALIZE FORM SOLIDLY WHILE COLOR IS FLAT
769 94
TITIAN AND TINTORET ARE ESSENTIALLY GOTHIC COLORISTS QUITE PERFECT BY ADOPTED CHIAROSCURO
BUT THE CHIAROSCURISTS CANNOT ON THEIR PART ADOPT COLOR EXCEPT PARTIALLY
HIS BELLY DEEP INTO ITS EVERY FISSURE--GLUED DOWN--LOADED DOWN
WHY AT LEAST COULD NOT TURNER HAVE KEPT IT OUT OF SIGHT HE HAS QUITE GRATUITOUSLY BROUGHT IT INTO SIGHT
MADONNA AND CHILD
18
AND FOR YOU THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IN ART AS IN LIFE IS TO BE QUIET AND FIRM--QUIET ABOVE EVERYTHING
THAT IS THE OUTLINE IS PREPARED FOR MODIFICATION OF COLOR ONLY
3
3
IT IS PRECISELY THAT BLANK VACANCY OF DECORATION AND SETTING OF THE MEAGER ANGLES AGAINST WIND AND WAR WHICH HE WANTS TO FORCE ON YOUR NOTICE THAT HE MAY TAKE YOU THOROUGHLY OUT OF ITALY AND GREECE AND PUT YOU WHOLLY INTO A BARBAROUS AND FROST-HARDENED LAND
LECTURES ON ART 1870 SEC
LECTURES ON ART 1870 SEC
LECTURES ON ART 1870 SEC
LECTURES ON ART 1870 SEC
AND SECONDLY THAT IT IS GRACEFUL
ALWAYS MELANCHOLY AND USUALLY HORRIBLE
BUT THE MASTERS WHO KNEW PRECISELY BEFORE THEY LAID TOUCH ON PAPER WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO--AND THIS MAY BE OBSERVE EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS OR GREATER THAN THE MEN WHO CHANGE
I THINK THE EXAMPLES OF SHELL OUTLINE IN YOUR COPYING SERIES MUST ALREADY HAVE MADE YOU FEEL THE EXACT NATURE OF A PURE OUTLINE THE DIFFICULTY OF IT AND THE VALUE
NAY THE MODES OF OPPOSITION IN THE GREATEST MEN ARE INLAID AND COMPLEX
SO THAT ELEMENTARY EXERCISES IN COLOR MUST BE DIRECTED LIKE FIRST EXERCISES IN MUSIC TO THE CLEAR SEPARATION OF NOTES
AND WHY HE HAS PUT BESIDE HER THE LOW TYPE OF AN ANIMAL'S PAIN A DOG LICKING ITS WOUNDED PAW
AND NOW I WILL SHOW YOU IN A VERY SIMPLE SUBJECT THE EXACT OPPOSITION OF THE TWO SCHOOLS
OF WHICH IN ENGLAND THE LANDSCAPE AND FLOWERS IN THE PSALTER OF HENRY THE SIXTH WILL SERVE YOU FOR A SUFFICIENT TYPE
2 NOW YOU MUST ALWAYS WATCH KEENLY WHAT TURNER'S CUE IS
ONE REASON OF THIS HAS BEEN THE IDEA THAT SUCH WORK WAS EASY ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO ATTEMPTED IT AND THE TOTAL VULGARITY AND WANT OF EDUCATION IN THE GREAT BODY OF ABLER ARTISTS RENDERING THEM INSENSITIVE TO QUALITIES OF FINE DELINEATION
BUT I TELL YOU POSITIVELY THERE WILL BE NO ENDURING VALUE IN WHAT YOU HAVE THUS DONE
AND THEREFORE WE MUST NOW KNOW PRECISELY WHAT AN OUTLINE IS HOW IT OUGHT TO BE REPRESENTED
NOW IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY NO
AND ONE OF THE CHIEF DELIGHTS WHICH ANY ONE WHO REALLY ENJOYS PAINTING FINDS IN THAT ART AS DISTINCT FROM SCULPTURE IS IN THIS EXQUISITE INLAYING OR JOINER'S WORK OF IT THE FITTING OF EDGE TO EDGE WITH A MANUAL SKILL PRECISELY CORRESPONDENT TO THE CLOSE APPLICATION OF CROWDED NOTES WITHOUT THE LEAST SLUR IN FINE HARP OR PIANO PLAYING
FOOTNOTE 4
BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION--THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
BUT IT IS SEPARATED EVERLASTINGLY FROM GOTHIC AND FROM ALL OTHER LIVING WORK BECAUSE THE PAINTER WAS TOO VAIN TO LOOK AT ANYTHING HE HAD TO PAINT AND DREW EVERY MASS OF HIS DRAPERY IN LINES THAT WERE AS IMPOSSIBLE AS THEY WERE STIFF AND STRETCHED OUT THE LIMBS OF HIS MADONNA IN ACTIONS AS UNLIKELY AS THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE
1034 ONE OF THE GREEK MAIN CHARACTERS YOU KNOW IS TO BE GREEK
WHENEVER YOU SET YOURSELF TO DRAW ANYTHING CONSIDER ONLY HOW BEST YOU MAY GIVE A PERSON WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE PLACE A TRUE IDEA OF IT
NOW THERE IS ONE GREAT NORTHERN PAINTER OF WHOM I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TILL NOW PROBABLY TO YOUR SURPRISE RUBENS
THE CIMA DIFFERS FROM THE REMBRANDT BY BEING LOVELY
FOOTNOTE 7
AND A PASSIONATE ONE WILL PAINT WITH MORTAR AND A TROWEL
I JUST NOW REFERRED TO THE LANDSCAPE BY JOHN BELLINI IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY AS ONE OF THE SIX BEST EXISTING OF THE PURIST SCHOOL BEING WHOLLY FELICITOUS AND ENJOYABLE
SO THAT NOT ONLY IN THE BEAUTIFUL DEXTERITY OF THE JOINER'S WORK BUT IN THE NECESSITY OF CUTTING OUT EACH PIECE OF COLOR AT ONCE AND FOREVER FOR THOUGH YOU CAN CORRECT AN ERRONEOUS JUNCTION OF BLACK AND WHITE BECAUSE THE GRAY BETWEEN HAS THE NATURE OF EITHER YOU CANNOT CORRECT AN ERRONEOUS JUNCTION OF RED AND GREEN WHICH MAKE A NEUTRAL BETWEEN THEM IF THEY OVERLAP THAT IS NEITHER RED NOR GREEN
THAT IS TO SAY THE EXPRESSION BY GRADATION OF LIGHT EITHER OF FORM OR SPACE
YOU ARE NOT TO ENDEAVOR TO EXPRESS YOUR OWN FEELINGS ABOUT IT
THESE FLOWERS BEAUTIFUL AS THEY ARE ARE NOT OF THE GOTHIC SCHOOL
THE FACTS OF THE SPOT ARE HERE GIVEN IN MERE AND PURE SIMPLICITY
BUT THE GREATER NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN A LANDSCAPE EITHER HAVE OUTLINES SO COMPLEX THAT NO PENCIL COULD FOLLOW THEM AS TREES IN MIDDLE DISTANCE OR THEY HAVE NO ACTUAL OUTLINE AT ALL BUT A GRADATED AND SOFTENED EDGE
THIS IS INDEED TO SOME EXTENT MERELY THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF A PRINCIPLE THAT HAS NO EXCEPTION
YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW TWO SWANS IN TWO MINUTES AND A HALF YOURSELVES
IS THIS A WHITE THING A GREEN THING OR A BLUE THING
ANOTHER IN HIS LEFT HAND WITH A LITTLE LAMPBLACK
HERE ON THE CONTRARY IS DUERER'S FLIGHT INTO EGYPT WITH GRAPES AND PALM FRUIT ABOVE
YET YOU FIND TURNER REPRESENTING THE LANCET WINDOW BY A FEW BARE OVAL LINES LIKE THE HOOP OF A BARREL
A QUITE UNPICTURESQUE BRIDGE A FEW TREES PARTLY STUNTED AND BLASTED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE TORRENT IN STORM AT THEIR ROOTS A COTTAGE WITH ITS MILL-WHEEL--THIS HAS LATELY BEEN PULLED DOWN TO WIDEN THE ROAD--AND THE BROOK SHED FROM THE ROCKS AND FINDING ITS WAY TO JOIN THE ARVE
DUMBLANE ABBEY
YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING REALLY GREAT OR GOOD IF YOU CAN'T PLEASE HER
AND THAT PURPOSE IS ALWAYS IMAGINATIVE--TO GET AT THE HEART OF THE THING NOT AT ITS OUTSIDE 40
HERE A GREEN CLUSTER OF LEAVES
THERE IS A DOME OF BURNING CLOUDS IN THE UPPER HEAVEN
PRODUCED BY JULIET SUTHERLAND LINDA CANTONI AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET LECTURES ON LANDSCAPE DELIVERED AT OXFORD IN LENT TERM 1871
THERE IS MUCH BETTER MASONRY AND MUCH MORE WONDERFUL RUIN OF IT ELSEWHERE
WHILE MICHAEL ANGELO HAS BEEN HAGGLING AT THIS DRAGON'S NECK FOR AN HOUR
BUT THAT WHATEVER IS ORDERLY HEALTHY RADIANT FRUITFUL AND BEAUTIFUL IS TO BE LOVED WITH ALL OUR HEARTS AND PAINTED WITH ALL OUR SKILL
BUT TURNER DID NOT PAINT EITHER OF THE SEA-PIECES FOR THE SAKE OF THESE DECOROUS ARRANGEMENTS
BUT BOTH ENGRAVED SO AS TO LOOK THOROUGHLY ROUND
THEN NOTE ALSO IN TURNER'S THAT CLINGING TO THE EARTH--THE SPECIALTY OF HIM--_IL GRAN NEMICO THE GREAT ENEMY PLUTUS
NOW THEREFORE OBSERVE THIS FOLLOWING QUITE PLAIN DIRECTION
THEY ARE SEEN BY GLEAMS OF SILVERY OR FIERY LIGHT RELIEVED AGAINST AN EQUALLY LIGHTED BLUE OF INIMITABLE DEPTH AND LOVELINESS
BUT PURE FORMAL CHIAROSCURO--MARC ANTONIO'S AND LEONARDO'S--IS INCONSISTENT WITH COLOR AND THOUGH IT IS THOROUGHLY NECESSARY AS AN EXERCISE IT IS ONLY AS A CORRECTING AND GUARDING ONE NEVER AS A BASIS OF ART
IT IS MERELY DIRTY AIR OR AT BEST A CHEMICAL SOLUTION ILL MADE
FIRST IT HAS NEVER YET RECEIVED DUE DEVELOPMENT
SO THAT IF I CHOSE TO PUT A PIECE OF BLACK NEAR THEM IT WOULD BE CONSPICUOUS WITH A VENGEANCE
23
AND THEN STANDING SIMPLY ON THE WILD MOSS-TROOPERS GROUND THE SCATTERED RUINS OF A GREAT ABBEY SEEN SO DIMLY THAT THEY SEEM TO BE FADING OUT OF SIGHT IN COLOR AS IN TIME
YOU CANNOT SEE A FINER WORK BY REMBRANDT
53
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU EVER TO SEE A MORE NOBLE WORK OF PASSIONATE GREEK CHIAROSCURO--REJOICING IN LIGHT
OTHELLO I
16
AND MODEST WITH THIS MOST ESSENTIAL MODESTY THAT YOU MUST LIKE THE LANDSCAPE YOU ARE GOING TO DRAW BETTER THAN YOU EXPECT TO LIKE YOUR DRAWING OF IT HOWEVER WELL IT MAY SUCCEED
THE PAINTER DOES NOT DESIRE THE EXCITEMENT OF RAPID MOVEMENT NOR EVEN THE PASSION OF BEAUTIFUL LIGHT
THAT THE WRATH OF A WILD BEAST AND THE TOSSING OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT ARE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO A PAINTER OF THE PURIST SCHOOL
USE ANY MEANS IN YOUR POWER TO DO THAT AND DON'T THINK OF THE PERSON FOR WHOM YOU ARE DRAWING AS A CONNOISSEUR BUT AS A PERSON OF ORDINARY SENSE AND FEELING
NIAGARA OR THE NORTH POLE AND THE AURORA BOREALIS WON'T MAKE A LANDSCAPE
15
IN THIS CEPHALUS ESPECIALLY NOTE THE EXTREME EQUALITY AND SERENITY OF EVERY OUTLINE
14
AGAIN THERE IS NOT A TOUCH OF BLACK IN ANY SHADOW HOWEVER DEEP OF THESE TWO STUDIES
96
NOR THE INDIAMAN TO SHOW YOU THE FORCE OF IMPACT IN A LIQUID MASS OF SEA-WATER OF GIVEN MOMENTUM
FOR ONE THING THE PASSION IS NECESSARY FOR THE MERE QUANTITY OF DESIGN
46
WHAT THEN CAN HE MEAN BY NOT SO MUCH AS INDICATING ONE PEBBLE OR JOINT IN THE WALLS OF DUMBLANE
AND THIS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
101
AND THE FINAL PERFECTIONS OF COLOR ARE THOSE IN WHICH OF INNUMERABLE NOTES OR HUES EVERY ONE HAS A DISTINCT OFFICE AND CAN BE FASTENED ON BY THE EYE AND APPROVED AS FULFILLING IT

AS LONG AS I CAN POSSIBLY KEEP YOU AMONG THEM THERE YOU SHALL STAY--AMONG THE ALMOND AND APPLE BLOSSOM
YOU THINK THAT SAYING OF THE GREEK SCHOOL--PINDAR'S SUMMARY OF IT GREEK
IN THE FLESHLY BASENESS BRUTALITY AND STUPIDITY OF ITS MAIN CONCEPTION IS THE DUTCH PART OF IT
LOOK AT HER BESIDE THIS MADONNA OF FILIPPO LIPPI'S
NEAR BLAIR ATHOL
LET ME NOTICE IN PASSING THE INFINITE ABSURDITY OF EVER HANGING VENETIAN PICTURES ABOVE THE LINE OF SIGHT
YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU THAT THE PURE GOTHIC SCHOOL OF COLOR WAS ENTIRETY CHEERFUL
MUCH MISCHIEF HAS BEEN DONE--ENDLESS MISAPPREHENSION INDUCED IN THIS MATTER--BY THE BLUNDERING RELIGIOUS PAINTERS OF GERMANY WHO HAVE BECOME EXAMPLES OF THE OPPOSITE ERROR FROM OUR ENGLISH PAINTERS OF THE CONSTABLE GROUP
81
A REAL PAINTER NEVER LOADS SEE THE VELASQUEZ NO
THE MOST SPLENDID DRAWING OF THE CHAIN OF THE ALPS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR RELATION TO HUMANITY IS NO MORE A TRUE LANDSCAPE THAN A PAINTING OF THIS BIT OF STONE
TINTORET RARELY SKETCHING AT ALL BUT PAINTING STRAIGHT AT THE FIRST BLOW WHILE HOLBEIN AND TURNER SKETCH INDEED BUT IT IS AS WITH A PEN OF IRON AND A POINT OF DIAMOND
AND IN THE OTHER OF PAIN AND DANGER
THE GENUINENESS OF IT YOU CAN--YES AND THE DEPTH OF SOURCE ALSO
AND ABOVE ALL REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE BLACK AND WHITE
THAT ALWAYS ARISES FROM YOUR NOT HAVING SYMPATHY ENOUGH WITH ITS VITAL CHARACTER AND LOOKING FOR PHYSICAL PICTURESQUENESS INSTEAD
AND THAT OBSERVE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE BOLDNESS OR MINUTENESS OF THE WORK
A LEVEL-TOPPED BANK
29
AND IT IS IN THIS RESPECT THAT I DESIRED YOU SECT
AND I CANNOT TOO OFTEN URGE YOU TO KEEP CLEARLY SEPARATE IN YOUR THOUGHTS THE SCHOOL WHICH I HAVE CALLED[11 OF CRYSTAL BECAUSE ITS DISTINCTIVE VIRTUE IS SEEN UNAIDED IN THE SHARP SEPARATIONS AND PRISMATIC HARMONIES OF PAINTED GLASS AND THE OTHER THE SCHOOL OF CLAY BECAUSE ITS DISTINCTIVE VIRTUE IS SEEN IN THE QUALITIES OF ANY FINE WORK IN UNCOLORED TERRA COTTA AND IN EVERY DRAWING WHICH REPRESENTS THEM
OVID METAMORPHOSES XI
IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEARTS TO FOLLOW OUT ONLY THE GOTHIC THOUGHTS OF LANDSCAPE I DEEPLY WISH YOU WOULD AND FOR MANY REASONS
AND ANY OF YOU WHO CARE FOR COLOR AT ALL CANNOT BUT TAKE MORE OR LESS PLEASURE IN THE BLACK AND GREENS AND WARM BROWNS OPPOSED THROUGHOUT
KEEP UP YOUR BRIGHT SWORDS FOR THE DEW WILL RUST THEM

LOOK AT WHAT TURNER WILL DO WHEN HIS CUE IS MASONRY,--IN THE COLISEUM
OF THE TWO THERE IS MORE EXCUSE FOR AND LESS DANGER IN THE FIRST THAN IN THE SECOND MISTAKE
I HAVE PURPOSEFULLY SKETCHED IT IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW THE ENTIRE VALUE OF IT DEPENDS ON THOUGHTFUL PLACING
FOOTNOTE 1
IN THE HEAD OF IRIS YOU HAVE THE PURE NORTHERN-GOTHIC PART OF IT BROUGHT DOWN TO RUBENS THROUGH GIORGIONE AND TITIAN
BUT FARTHER
45
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER 98
AND AMONG ALL THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO PAINT OUR COMMON WILD-FLOWERS I HAVE ONLY ONCE--AND THAT IN THIS VERY YEAR JUST IN TIME TO SHOW IT TO YOU--SEEN THE THING DONE RIGHTLY
NOW TO-DAY I MUST GUARD YOU CAREFULLY AGAINST A MISAPPREHENSION OF THIS KIND
YOU MAY OF COURSE FIND THE TWO PURPOSES MINGLED
TO KEEP A LITTLE DIARY OF THE MANNER OF IT AND TO HAVE BESIDE YOUR WINDOW A SMALL SKETCH-BOOK WITH PENCIL CUT OVER NIGHT AND COLORS MOIST
LANDSCAPE PAINTING IS THE THOUGHTFUL AND PASSIONATE REPRESENTATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS APPOINTED FOR HUMAN EXISTENCE
66
YOU HAVE HEARD ME STATE TO YOU SEVERAL TIMES THAT ALL THE MASTERS WHO VALUED ACCURATE FORM AND MODELING FOUND THE READIEST WAY OF OBTAINING THE FACTS THEY REQUIRED TO BE FIRM PEN OUTLINE COMPLETED BY A WASH OF NEUTRAL TINT
HE HAS ABOVE ALL THINGS MISSED THE PROPORTION AND NECESSARILY THEREFORE THE BEND OF ITS NECK
BOTH SO FAR AS THEY ARE AIMING AT FORM ARE NOW WORKING IN THE GREEK SCHOOL OF PHIDIAS
FIRST ACADEMIC OR GREEK FLESHLINESS AND SOLIDITY AS OPPOSED TO GOTHIC IMAGINATION
NOT THAT MICHAEL ANGELO UNDERSTANDS HIS DRAGON AS THE OTHERS DO
WITH SWEET COPSEWOOD AND RUDELY GROWING TREES
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID HE IS THE ONLY GREAT LANDSCAPE-PAINTER AND TO BE YOUR ONLY GUIDE BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY LANDSCAPE-PAINTER WHO CAN DRAW AN OUTLINE
AND FROM ALWAYS FASTENING ON ONE OR TWO POINTS OF MY SUBJECT AND NEGLECTING THE REST
BUT THAT IS BECAUSE THE FINEST NATURES REMAIN YOUNG TO THE DEATH
WITHIN AN YLE ME THOUGHT I WAS WHERE WALL AND YATE WAS ALL OF GLASSE AND SO WAS CLOSED ROUND ABOUT THAT LEAVELESSE NONE COME IN NE OUT UNCOUTH AND STRAUNGE TO BEHOLDE FOR EVERY YATE OF FINE GOLDE A THOUSAND FANES AIE TURNING ENTUNED HAD AND BRIDDES SINGING DIVERS AND ON EACH FANE A PAIRE WITH OPEN MOUTH AGAIN HERE
FOOTNOTE 14
BUT THIS IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRAWING TRENCHANT LINES OF PARTING NEED NEVER INTERFERE WITH THE DISTINCTNESS OF OUR CONCEPTION OF THE OPPONENT PRINCIPLES WHICH BALANCE EACH OTHER IN GREAT MINDS OR PARALYZE EACH OTHER IN WEAK ONES
BUT THE VALLEY OF CLUSE IF YOU KNEW IT IS WORTH MANY CHAMOUNIS
DUMBLANE ABBEY IS A PRETTY PIECE OF BUILDING ENOUGH IT IS TRUE
IT WILL HAPPEN CONSTANTLY THAT FORMS ARE ENTIRELY DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER AND SEPARATED BY TRUE LIMITS WHICH ARE YET INVISIBLE OR NEARLY SO TO THE EYE
REENFORCING AFTERWARDS WHEN NECESSARY BUT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
AND THIS IT WILL BE RIGHT TO DEFINE IN QUITE GENERAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL SUBJECTS
YET SO SMALL THAT YOU CAN SCARCELY SEE ITS FEET AND THAT I COULD NOT WITH MY FINEST-POINTED BRUSH COPY THEIR STEALTHY ACTION
AND THAT IS YOUR OUTLINE

AND THE OTHER OF HOT AND THEY ARE BOTH EXQUISITELY DESIGNED IN ORNAMENTAL LINES
BUT JOHN BELLINI LOOKS UPON THAT AS AN ENTIRELY CHEERFUL AND PLEASING INCIDENT
AND I MUST BEG YOU TO OBSERVE AND RECEIVE AS A RULE WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION THAT WHETHER COLOR BE GAY OR SAD THE VALUE OF IT DEPENDS NEVER ON VIOLENCE BUT ALWAYS ON SUBTLETY
82
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER 37
BUT THE FACTS OF THE SOLID FORM ARE OF SO VITAL IMPORTANCE AND THE PERFECT COMMAND OF THEM SO NECESSARY TO THE DIGNITY AND INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE WORK THAT THE GREATEST ARTISTS EVEN FOR THEIR FINISHED DRAWINGS LIKE TO LIMIT EVERY SOLID FORM BY A FINE LINE WHETHER ITS CONTOUR BE VISIBLE TO THE EYE OR NOT
A MILL WEIR THROWN ACROSS STAYS THE WATER IN A PERFECTLY CLEAR AND DELICIOUS POOL
IN MISSAL PAINTING EXQUISITE FIGURE-DRAWING IS FREQUENT AND LANDSCAPE BACKGROUNDS IN LATE WORKS ARE ELABORATE
MANY COMMONPLACE PERSONS BRED IN GOOD SCHOOLS HAVE PAINTED THE FIGURE PLEASANTLY OR EVEN WELL
BUT I CONFESS MYSELF ALWAYS AMAZED IN LOOKING AT MICHAEL ANGELO'S WORK HERE OR ELSEWHERE AT HIS TOTAL CARELESSNESS OF ANATOMICAL CHARACTER EXCEPT ONLY IN THE HUMAN BODY
76
THE TESTING RULE I GAVE FOR GOOD COLOR IN THE ELEMENTS OF DRAWING IS THAT YOU MAKE THE WHITE PRECIOUS AND THE BLACK CONSPICUOUS

77
ONLY A LITTLE WALL-LIZARD HOLDING THE PAPER IN ITS MOUTH PERFECT
NOW DOWN TO THE LEAST DETAIL OF METHOD AND SUBJECT THAT WILL HOLD
90
YOU ARE NOT TO BE IMPROVED BY THE PIETY OF HIS EXPRESSION NOR DISGUSTED BY ITS TRUCULENCE
THERE IS NO TEXTURE AIMED AT NO COMPLETION SCARCELY ANY VARIETY OF LIGHT AND SHADE
IT IS HIS SIGNATURE
THE PATCHES OF VELVET ARE ALSO DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF HER DRESS BY A LINEAR LIMIT WHICH HE FOLLOWS WITH HIS PEN JUST AS DECISIVELY
WE SAW IN THE FIFTH LECTURE[5 THAT EVERY VISIBLE THING CONSISTED OF SPACES OF COLOR TERMINATED EITHER BY SHARP OR GRADATED LIMITS
THE FIRST IN OPPOSITION OF LOCAL BLACK TO DIFFUSED SUNSHINE
IF YOU LOOK FIRST AT THE FACES IN THIS PICTURE YOU WILL FIND THEM UGLY--OFTEN WITHOUT EXPRESSION ALWAYS ILL OR CARELESSLY DRAWN
BUT RUBENS BEGINS WITH ATHENS AND ADOPTS FROM VENICE
AND INDICATING THE REST OF THE STRUCTURE BY A MONOTONOUS AND THIN PIECE OF OUTLINE OF WHICH I WAS ASKED BY ONE OF YOURSELVES LAST TERM AND QUITE NATURALLY AND RIGHTLY HOW TURNER CAME TO DRAW IT SO SLIGHTLY--OR WE MAY EVEN SAY SO BADLY
NOT SO
THIS WILD LAND POSSESSES A SUBDUED AND IMPERFECT SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND HAS AN INFINITELY TRAGIC FEUDAL PASTORAL AND CIVIC HISTORY
AND SO FAR AS FAILURE OF TIME OR MATERIALS COMPELS YOU TO FINISH ONE PART OR EXPRESS ONE CHARACTER RATHER THAN ANOTHER OF COURSE DWELL ON THE FEATURES THAT INTEREST YOU MOST
AND ACCORDINGLY I PROPOSE DURING THIS AND THE FOLLOWING TERM TO GIVE YOU WHAT PRACTICAL LEADING I CAN IN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF LANDSCAPE AND OF A BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY WHICH WILL FORM A KIND OF CENTER FOR ALL THE REST--ICHTHYOLOGY
FOOTNOTE 12
AND YOU MAY AFTERWARDS SUBSTITUTE CLEAR SKY FOR THE GOLDEN BACKGROUND WITHOUT DANGER OF LOSS OR SACRIFICE OF SYSTEM
BUT NOW I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND TURNER'S DEPTH OF SYMPATHY FARTHER STILL
ELEUTHERIA YOU SEE HOW DOUBLY HOW INTIMATELY OPPOSED THE IDEAS ARE
IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THE LECTURES I GAVE YOU THROUGH LAST YEAR YOU MUST BE GRADUALLY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO MY DEFINITION OF THE GREEK SCHOOL IN ART AS ONE ESSENTIALLY CHIAROSCURIST AS OPPOSED TO GOTHIC COLOR
FIRST A THIN WARM GROUND HAD BEEN LAID OVER THE WHOLE CANVAS WHICH CARPACCIO WANTED AS AN UNDER-CURRENT THROUGH ALL THE COLOR JUST AS THERE IS AN UNDER-CURRENT OF GRAY IN THE LOIRE DRAWINGS
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED HIS DISTURBED MIND ABOUT IT IN THE FIGURE OF A POOR LITTLE BROWN--NEARLY BLACK--FAUN OR PERHAPS THE GOD FAUNUS HIMSELF WHO IS MUCH PUZZLED BY THE DEATH OF PROCRIS AND STOOPS OVER HER THINKING IT A WOEFUL THING TO FIND HER PRETTY BODY LYING THERE BREATHLESS AND ALL SPOTTED WITH BLOOD ON THE BREAST
SO THAT AS I WROTE LONG AGO IN THE THIRD VOLUME OF MODERN PAINTERS YOU ARE ALWAYS SAFE IF YOU HOLD THE HAND OF A COLORIST
AND WHEN THIS IS DONE AS BY JOHN BELLINI IN THE PICTURE OF PETER MARTYR,[2 OR AS IT WAS BY TITIAN IN THE GREAT PETER MARTYR WITH EVERY LEAF IN A WOOD HE GETS TIRED
AND ACCORDINGLY WHENEVER TINTORET CHOOSES HE CAN LAUGH RUBENS TO SCORN IN MANAGEMENT OF LIGHT AND SHADE
OR DO YOU THINK IT A DISHONOR TO MAN TO SAY TO HIM THAT DEATH IS BUT ONLY REST
BUT AS A TYPE OF ACADEMICAL CHIAROSCURO IT WILL GIVE YOU MOST VALUABLE LESSONS ON THE OTHER SIDE--OF WARNING
THE SECOND IN THE DECORATIVE GROUPING OF WHITE SPOTS ON A DARK GROUND
IT IMITATES THE ASPECTS AND RECORDS THE PHENOMENA OF THE VISIBLE THINGS WHICH ARE DANGEROUS OR BENEFICIAL TO MEN
HERE THEREFORE IS YOUR FIRST GREAT LAW
OUTLINE 1 LECTURE II
FIRST IN THE MEANTIME YOU MUST DRAW THEM RIGHTLY IF IT TAKES TWO HOURS INSTEAD OF TWO MINUTES
YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU HOW THE EARTHLY POWER THAT IS NECESSARY IN ART WAS SHOWN BY THE FLIGHT OF DAEDALUS TO THE GREEK
AND TURNER HAS GIVEN YOU THE BIRTH OF THE SHEPHERD HERMES ON CYLLENE IN ITS VISIBLE AND SOLEMN PRESENCE THE WHITE CLOUD HERMES ERIOPHOROS FORMING OUT OF HEAVEN UPON THE HILLS
ACKERMANN AT HIS REPOSITORY OF ARTS 1820 THEY ARE IN SPITE OF THEIR WEAKNESSES ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY LANDSCAPES I COULD SHOW YOU WHICH GIVE YOU A REAL IDEA OF THE PLACES OR WHICH PUT YOUR MINDS INTO THE TONE WHICH IF YOU WERE HAPPY AND AT EASE THEY WOULD TAKE IN THE AIR AND LIGHT OF ITALY
BUT IT IS AS SOFT AS IT IS DEEP AND AS QUIET AS THE LIGHT OF DAWN
THE OUTLINE OF A CUP OF A SHELL OR OF AN ANIMAL'S LIMB HAS A DETERMINABLE COURSE WHICH YOUR PEN OR PENCIL LINE EITHER COINCIDES WITH OR DOES NOT
IN GOOD ART WHETHER PAINTING OR SCULPTURE I HAVE AGAIN AND AGAIN TOLD YOU EVERY TOUCH IS NECESSARY AND BEAUTIFULLY INTENDED
HERPETON MINOS
IN A WORD FOR ALL THE SAFEGUARDS AND SEVERE DIGNITIES OF THEIR ART
LORY OF NEUFCHATEL
AND SECONDLY OF GREEK TRAGIC HORROR AND GLOOM AS OPPOSED TO GOTHIC GLADNESS
NOW IT IS TRUE THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL LICHENS AT BLAIR ATHOL AND GOOD BUILDING AT DUMBLANE
IF YOU ARE WITHOUT STRONG PASSIONS YOU CANNOT BE A PAINTER AT ALL
PERHAPS YOU THINK ON SUCH CONDITIONS YOU NEVER CAN PAINT LANDSCAPE AT ALL
WHAT PLACE IS YOUR THICK LINE TO HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE LIMIT WHICH IT REPRESENTS--OUTSIDE OF IT OR INSIDE OR OVER IT
PERHAPS SO AND I CAN SHOW YOU HOW
THERE'S A CART AND RIDER'S TRACK THROUGH IT AMONG THE COPSE
ALWAYS OF COURSE IS A WIDE WORD
IF YOU ONLY THINK OF THE SCENE WHAT A NICE SKETCH THIS WILL MAKE BE ASSURED YOU WILL NEVER MAKE A NICE SKETCH OF IT
HAD THIS SCENE BEEN IN AMERICA NO MORTAL COULD HAVE MADE A LANDSCAPE OF IT
ALL THE OTHER GREAT CHIAROSCURISTS WHOM I NAMED TO YOU--REYNOLDS VELASQUEZ AND TITIAN--APPROACHED THEIR SHADOW ALSO ON THE SAFE SIDE--FROM VENICE
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER HE DOES NOT WANT TO PAINT BLUE MIST IN ORDER TO TEACH YOU THE NATURE OF EVAPORATION
26
AND BESIDES ANYBODY CAN ROUND ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE FULL SCALE FROM WHITE HIGH LIGHT TO BLACK SHADOW
THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF SCOTLAND IS THAT OF A WILD AND THINLY INHABITED ROCKY COUNTRY NOT SUBLIMELY MOUNTAINOUS BUT BEAUTIFUL IN LOW ROCK AND LIGHT STREAMLET EVERYWHERE
FOR AT THE MOMENT WHEN ARTISTIC SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE OF EFFECT BECAME SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE ITS PURPOSES THE REFORMATION DESTROYED THE FAITH IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
THE CONTEST OF APELLES WITH PROTOGENES CONSISTED IN STRIKING THIS TRUE LIMIT WITHIN EACH OTHER'S LINES MORE AND MORE FINELY
23 IN THE OUTSET I MUST SHORTLY STATE TO YOU THE POSITION WHICH LANDSCAPE PAINTING AND ANIMAL PAINTING HOLD TOWARDS THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF ART
BUT THE VIRTUE OF THE WHOLE SCENE AND MEANING IS NOT IN THE MASONRY OF IT
BUT THE WHOLE WORLD OF ART IS FULL OF A BASE LEARNING OF THE ACADEMY WHICH WHEN FOOLS POSSESS THEY BECOME A TENFOLD PLAGUE OF FOOLS
YOU WILL SCARCELY BE DISPOSED TO ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF SUCH A LIMITATION
GREEK FLESHLINESS AGAINST HUNGRY WASTING OF THE SELF-FORGETFUL BODY
NO MAN IS NATURALLY LIKELY TO THINK FIRST OF ANATOMY IN PAINTING A PRETTY WOMAN
AND SECONDLY BECAUSE LIGHT AND SHADE ARE MELANCHOLY WHILE COLOR IS GAY
FOOTNOTE 11
BUT NOW OBSERVE FARTHER
LOOK ONCE MORE AT THIS GREEK DANCING-GIRL WHICH IS FROM A TERRA COTTA AND THEREFORE INTENSELY OF THE SCHOOL OF CLAY
AND I WARNED MY FRIEND AT ONCE TO GUARD HIS PUBLIC AGAINST THE SORE DISAPPOINTMENT THEIR FIRST SIGHT OF THESE SO MUCH CELEBRATED WORKS WOULD BE TO THEM
IF RIGHT IT IS IN A MEASURE SUGGESTIVE AND NOBLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE CHARACTER OF THE OBJECT
NOBODY WILL BELIEVE THAT THE MAIN VIRTUE OF TURNER IS IN HIS DRAWING
CHOOSE THEN A SUBJECT THAT INTERESTS YOU
AT THE RUSKIN DRAWING SCHOOL OXFORD THE EYE WILL ENDURE WITH PATIENCE OR EVEN LINGER WITH PLEASURE ON ANY LINE THAT IS RIGHT HOWEVER COARSE
POIKILIA IS AS STUDIOUSLY AND DELICIOUSLY CARRIED OUT BY TURNER WITH THE DAEDALUS SIDE OF HIM IN THE INLAYING OF THESE WHITE SPOTS ON THE INDIAMAN'S DECK AS IF HE WERE WORKING A PRECIOUS TOY IN EBONY AND IVORY
WHEN HIS IMAGINATION WAS STILL FRESHLY FILLED WITH THE GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND HE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH HIS OWN EYES THE CLOUDS COME DOWN UPON THE ACTUAL EARTH
THREE MINUTES AT THE MOST ALLOWED FOR ALL THE BEAST
AND YOU WILL SEE WHY IT IS A FAUN WHO IS PUT TO WONDER AT HER SHE HAVING ESCAPED BY ARTIFICE FROM THE BESTIAL POWER OF MINOS
YET SHE IS WHOLLY AN EARTH-NYMPH AND THE SON OF AURORA MUST NOT ONLY LEAVE HER BUT HIMSELF SLAY HER
NOT SUGGESTIONS OF CONTINGENT GRACE BUT DETERMINATIONS OF THE LIMITS OF FUTURE FORM
92
BUT AS A MERE PATTERN OF BLUE AND WHITE HE HAD BETTER HAVE PAINTED A JAY'S WING
91
41
I GO BACK TO ANOTHER PERFECT LANDSCAPE OF THE LIVING GOTHIC SCHOOL
30
AND WOULD YOU NOT HAVE EXPECTED THAT--BEFORE ALL THINGS--THE FIRST THING HE WOULD HAVE SEEN IN A PEACOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN GOLD AND BLUE
BUT ITS CHARM WILL NEVER FAIL
ONE IS A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY OF COOL COLOR
BUT ATTENDING MAINLY TO GET THE CHARACTER OF THE BIRD BY THE PURE OUTLINE OF ITS FORM AS IF IT WERE CUT OUT OF A PIECE OF RUBY GLASS
AND GREEK SIMPLICITY AND COLD VERACITY AGAINST GOTHIC RAPTURE OF TRUSTED VISION
AND THE SCHOOLS OF CLAY ABSOLUTELY REALISTIC TEMPERATE AND SIMPLE IN PURPOSE ARE IN METHOD MYSTERIOUS AND SOFT
BUT IF I CAN'T BLUE OR GREEN THEY AT LEAST SHALL BE
AND NOT AMONG OUR SOFT-FLOWING RIVERS ONLY
I SHOWED YOU ONE OF THE STONES THEMSELVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF UNINTERESTING OUTLINE
BUT THE OUTHOUSES AND REFECTORY OF THE ABBEY HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A FARMHOUSE AND THAT IS INHABITED AND IN FRONT OF IT THE MISTRESS IS FEEDING HER CHICKENS
73
ONE IS A CALM ON THE SHORE AT SCARBOROUGH
89
HE HAS PAINTED A NOBLE HUMAN CREATURE SIMPLY IN CLEAR DAYLIGHT
THE FIRST THE NATIVITY BY SANDRO BOTTICELLI.[10 IT IS AN EARLY WORK BY HIM
BUT THERE ARE LOVELY LICHENS ALL OVER THE COLD REGIONS OF THE WORLD AND THERE IS FAR MORE INTERESTING ARCHITECTURE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAN IN SCOTLAND
AND DESPAIRING AS OPPOSED TO GOTHIC HOPE
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT WOULD BE TO EXCLAIM HOW UNLUCKY THAT WAS THERE AT ALL
AND NOW I THINK THE MEMBERS OF MY CLASS WILL MORE READILY PARDON THE INTENSELY IRKSOME WORK I PUT THEM TO WITH THE COMPASSES AND THE RULER
AND DISPLAYS THE HUMAN METHODS OF DEALING WITH THESE AND OF ENJOYING THEM OR SUFFERING FROM THEM WHICH ARE EITHER EXEMPLARY OR DESERVING OF SYMPATHETIC CONTEMPLATION
THERE IS TURNER'S DRAGON
2
2
ALSO OBSERVE THAT AS YOUR REPRESENTING THIS LIMIT BY A DARK LINE IS A CONVENTIONALISM AND JUST AS MUCH A CONVENTIONALISM WHEN THE LINE IS SUBTLE AS WHEN IT IS THICK THE GREAT MASTERS ACCEPT AND DECLARE THAT CONVENTIONALISM WITH PERFECT FRANKNESS AND USE BOLD AND DECISIVE OUTLINE IF ANY
THIS IS NO LONGER TO MAKE US THINK OF THE DEATH OF HAPPY SOULS BUT OF THE LABOR OF UNHAPPY ONES
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THE ONE MORE INTERESTING TO YOU IN A LANDSCAPE THAN THE OTHER IS THAT YOU COULD TUMBLE OVER THE PERPENDICULAR FRACTURE--AND COULDN'T TUMBLE OVER THE OTHER
HERE IS A SKETCH OF AN ENGLISH PARK SCENE WHICH REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE CHARACTER OF A STUDY FROM NATURE BY TURNER
TURNER 2 NEAR BLAIR ATHOL BY J.M.W
NEITHER DID HE PAINT THE SCARBOROUGH AS A PROFESSOR OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE TO SHOW YOU THE LEVEL OF LOW TIDE ON THE YORKSHIRE COAST
AND LEST THAT SHOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO SHOW YOU THEY BURNT WOOD HE HAS MADE HIS FOREGROUND OF A PIECE OF COPSE JUST LOPPED WITH THE NEW FAGOTS STANDING UP AGAINST IT
WHAT IS BEST IS NOT TO THINK OF YOURSELF AT ALL BUT TO STATE AS PLAINLY AND SIMPLY AS YOU CAN THE WHOLE TRUTH OF THE THING
YOU WILL SOON FEEL BY THIS MEANS WHAT ARE THE REAL DIFFICULTIES TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN ALL LANDSCAPE COLORING AND YOUR EYES WILL BE EDUCATED TO QUANTITY AND HARMONIOUS ACTION OF FORMS
NOW IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMMAND THIS STATE OF MIND OR ANYTHING LIKE IT IN YOURSELVES AT ONCE
BUT THE GERMANS DRAW FINELY AND RESOLUTELY WRONG
IN BOTH THE TURNER LANDSCAPES IT IS THE DEATH OF THE BODY BY THE IMPATIENCE AND ERROR OF LOVE
WERE IT MY CUE TO FIGHT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WITHOUT A PROMPTER."[8 FOOTNOTE 8
WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD-SHEPHERD--TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES--HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY!--OF THE WAR-WOLF AND THE GIER-EAGLE
FOR YOUR ONLY OBJECT IS TO GET TO CHAMOUNI AND UP MONT BLANC AND DOWN AGAIN
65
THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF THE PICTURE IS A MYSTIC SYMBOLISM BY MOTION AND CHIAROSCURO
BUT THERE EXIST SOME EXQUISITE THOUGH FEEBLER DESIGNS IN MISSAL PAINTING
YET IN THESE SKETCHES OF MINE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF COLOR THERE IS ENOUGH TO SHOW YOU THE NATURE AND THE VALUE OF THE METHOD
HE PAINTED THIS TO SHOW YOU THE DAILY COURSE OF QUIET HUMAN WORK AND HAPPINESS AND THAT TO ENABLE YOU TO CONCEIVE SOMETHING OF UTTERMOST HUMAN MISERY--BOTH ORDERED BY THE POWER OF THE GREAT DEEP
YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE PRODUCED A BEAUTIFUL WORK
I USED THE WORD PRISMATIC JUST NOW OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AS BEING IRIDESCENT
AND THIS STILL NOT BEING ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU THE IDEA OF PERFECT CLEANLINESS HE HAS COVERED THE STONES OF THE RIVER-BED WITH WHITE CLOTHES LAID OUT TO DRY
THEORETICALLY IT IS TO BE OVER IT
AND I WANT YOU TO BEGIN WITH COLOR IN THE VERY OUTSET AND TO SEE EVERYTHING AS CHILDREN WOULD SEE IT
84
IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
FIRST OF THE TERMINAL LINES OF LANDSCAPE OR OF DRAWING IN OUTLINE
BUT BY MERE CARE IN THE PLACING THE THING IS BEAUTIFUL
I DO NOT DOUBT THAT IT HAS OFTEN BEEN MATTER OF WONDER AMONG ANY OF YOU WHO HAD FAITH IN MY JUDGMENT WHY I GAVE TO THE UNIVERSITY AS CHARACTERISTIC OF TURNER'S WORK THE SIMPLE AND AT FIRST UNATTRACTIVE DRAWINGS OF THE LOIRE SERIES
93 ST MARK THUS YOU HAVE THE SANDRO BOTTICELLI OF THE NOBLE GREEK SCHOOL IN FLORENCE
IN THE PAUL VERONESE IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY YOU WILL EVERY HERE AND THERE FIND PIECES OF OUTLINE LIKE THIS OF HOLBEIN'S
50
NOT IN RAPTURE NOR YET IN AGONY
AND HE HAS ALL THE SPLENDID NORTHERN-GOTHIC REYNOLDS OR GAINSBOROUGH PLAY OF FEATURE WITH VENETIAN COLOR
52
YOU NONE OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE SCENE NOW
FIRST I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE STRUCK BY HAVING TWO LARGE PEACOCKS PAINTED WITH SCARCELY ANY COLOR IN THEM
47
AND NO ONE ELSE EXCEPT TINTORET COULD HAVE DRAWN WITH THE SAME EASE EITHER THE MUSCLES OF THE DEAD BODY OR THE PLUMES OF THE BIRDS
SOME FEW OTHERS OF THE KIND EXIST IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY AND ELSEWHERE
THE TRUE LIMIT FALLING ALL THE WAY ALONG THE CENTER OF YOUR THICK LINE
OF THE PURIST SCHOOL 95
EVERYTHING DONE TO GOOD PURPOSE NOTHING FOR VAIN GLORY
I HAVE BROUGHT TWO OLD-FASHIONED COLORED ENGRAVINGS,[4 WHICH ARE A PRECISE TYPE OF THE STYLE I WANT YOU TO BEGIN WITH
83
SO THAT TO THIS DAY ALL THE LOVELIEST THINGS IN THE WORLD REMAIN UNPAINTED
THUS THE PRACTICE OF COLOR EDUCATES AT ONCE IN NEATNESS OF HAND AND DISTINCTNESS OF WILL
THEY WERE AGONIZING GREEK EFFORTS TO GET LIGHT
VALLEY OF CLUSES BY J.M.W
THE OTHER THAT OF PEACE WHICH HAS STRIVEN AGAINST BORDER-RIDING--HOW VAINLY
THIS LAST THE LOVELIEST OF ALL GIVES THE WARMTH OF A SUMMER TWILIGHT WITH A TINGE OF COLOR ON THE GRAY PAPER SO SLIGHT THAT IT MAY BE A QUESTION WITH SOME OF YOU WHETHER ANY IS THERE
I TOLD YOU ALSO THAT NO COMPLETE SYSTEM OF ART FOR EITHER NATURAL HISTORY OR LANDSCAPE COULD BE FORMED ON THIS SYSTEM
CLEAR SKY OF GOLDEN LIGHT OR DEEP AND FULL BLUE FOR THE FULL BLUE OF TITIAN IS JUST AS MUCH A PIECE OF CONVENTIONAL ENAMELED BACKGROUND AS IF IT WERE A PLATE OF GOLD
NOW TO GO BACK TO TURNER
HE HAS DASHED OUT THE FILAMENTS OF EVERY FEATHER WITH MAGNIFICENT DRAWING
WHOSE POWER IS COMPOSED OF SO MANY ELEMENTS AND WHOSE CHARACTER MAY BE ILLUSTRATED SO COMPLETELY AND WITH IT THE VARIOUS OPERATION OF THE COUNTER SCHOOLS BY ONE OF HIS PICTURES NOW OPEN TO YOUR STUDY THAT I WOULD PRESS YOU TO SET ASIDE ONE OF YOUR BRIGHTEST EASTER AFTERNOONS FOR THE STUDY OF THAT ONE PICTURE IN THE EXHIBITION OF OLD MASTERS THE SO-CALLED JUNO AND ARGUS NO
AND THE EFFECT OF LIGHT FOR COMMON WORK QUITE CURIOUSLY HARMONIOUS AND DECEPTIVE
ALL THEIR DRAPERY IS DRIFTED SO AS TO MAKE YOU FEEL THE WHIRLWIND OF THEIR MOTION
HE IS A VERY SECOND-RATE AND COARSE COLORIST
WHILE THE FAINTEST OR FINEST THAT IS WRONG WILL BE FORCIBLY DESTRUCTIVE
8
THE DISCIPLINE OF YOUTH IN ALL ITS WORK IS IN COOLING AND CURBING ITSELF AS THE DISCIPLINE OF AGE IS IN WARMING AND URGING ITSELF
FOR AS NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS THERE IS NO BIGNESS OR LITTLENESS TO YOU
THEN THE QUALITIES OF GRACE IN DESIGN BECOME PARAMOUNT TO EVERY OTHER
NOR IN A PERPENDICULAR FRACTURE OF A ROCK THAN IN A HORIZONTAL ONE
67
ENGRAVED FROM DESIGNS BY J
HE PAINTS THE BLUE MIST BECAUSE IT BRINGS LIFE AND JOY TO MEN AND THE LAVA STREAM BECAUSE IT IS DEATH TO THEM
THE FLOWERS ARE STILL BEAUTIFUL BUT--INTENTIONALLY--OF THE COLOR OF BLOOD
BUT THEN REMEMBER SO DO ALL THE BASEST
TURNER 20 MADONNA AND CHILD BY FILIPPO LIPPI 33 THE LADY WITH THE BROOCH BY SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS 35 AESACUS AND HESPERIE BY J.M.W
HERE IS AN EGG
BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOUR SYSTEM OF STUDY SHOULD BE A COMPLETE ONE IF IT BE RIGHT AND PROFITABLE THOUGH INCOMPLETE
THOSE PICTURES WHICH YOU ALL LAUGHED AT WERE NOT WHAT YOU FANCIED MAD ENDEAVORS FOR COLOR
THE REST OF THE PICTURE IS AS FALSE IN LIGHT AND SHADE AS IT IS PRETENTIOUS MADE UP CHIEFLY OF GLEAMING BUTTONS IN PLACES WHERE NO LIGHT COULD POSSIBLY REACH THEM
35
YOU WILL FIND THAT STATEMENT EARLY IN THE FIRST VOLUME OF MODERN PAINTERS AND REPEATED NOW THROUGH ALL MY WORKS THESE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS IN VAIN
85
BUT THE TWO MEN REACH THE SAME POINT BY OPPOSITE PATHS
NOW YOU KNOW THAT RUBENS IS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF AS A GREAT COLORIST PAR EXCELLENCE A COLORIST
NAY IS NOT EVEN A GOOD COLORIST
AND THAT WHILE ALL OTHER LANDSCAPE-PAINTERS STUDY FROM NATURE IN SHADE OR IN COLOR TURNER ALWAYS SKETCHED WITH THE POINT
TURNER 48 LECTURES ON LANDSCAPE
THE ONE INDULGENCE WHICH I WOULD HAVE YOU ALLOW YOURSELVES IN FAST COLORING FOR SOME TIME IS THE ENDEAVOR TO SECURE SOME RECORD AT THE INSTANT OF THE COLORS OF MORNING CLOUDS
BUT HE HAS NEVER WITH HIS DUTCH EYES PERCEIVED TWO POINTS IN A SWAN WHICH ARE VITAL TO IT
AND NOW I WILL ASK YOU TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THREE MORE PICTURES IN THE LONDON EXHIBITION
BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT CARE FOR THE TRUTH YOU CAN ACT AS IF YOU DID AND TELL IT
PAGE LECTURE I
IF ANYTHING ERR ON THE SIDE OF CONCEALING THEM
THIS STONE IS JUST AS INTERESTING TO YOU OR OUGHT TO BE--AS IF IT WAS A MILLION TIMES AS BIG
34
THAT DEPTH OF BLUE IN RELATION TO FOREGROUND OBJECTS BEING WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE
SEE AT LEAST THEN THAT YOU REACH THE LEVEL OF SUCH DEGRADATION
100
BUT AS REGARDS THE COMPOSITION OF HIS PICTURE THE DRAWING IS ALWAYS FIRST WITH TURNER THE COLOR SECOND
A LITTLE CASCADE WHICH DESCENDS TO THE ROAD FROM GENEVA TO CHAMOUNI NEAR THE VILLAGE OF MAGLANS FROM UNDER A SUBORDINATE RIDGE OF THE AIGUILLE DE VARENS KNOWN AS THE AIGUILLETTE
HIS SITTER HAS HAD A PRETTY SILVER BROOCH ON WHICH REYNOLDS HAVING DONE AS MUCH AS HE CHOSE TO THE FACE FOR THAT TIME PAINTS QUIETLY IN ITS PLACE BELOW LEAVING THE DRESS BETWEEN TO BE FITTED IN AFTERWARDS
VIII
THE CATTLE BY THE POOL THE MILKMAID CROSSING THE BRIDGE WITH HER PAIL ON HER HEAD THE MILL WITH THE OLD MILLSTONES AND ITS GLEAMING WEIR AS HIS CHIEF LIGHT LED ACROSS BEHIND THE WILD TREES
WHEREAS IF YOU THINK OF THE SCENE AH IF I COULD ONLY GET SOME SHADOW OR SCRAWL OF THIS TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE!"--THEN WHATEVER YOU DO WILL BE ACCORDING TO YOUR STRENGTH GOOD AND PROGRESSIVE
NOW THE FIRST QUESTION RESPECTING IT IS
BUT A YET MORE IMPORTANT PURPOSE IN EACH OF THE DESIGNS IN THAT BOOK IS THE EXPRESSION OF SUCH LANDSCAPE POWERS AND CHARACTER AS HAVE ESPECIAL RELATION TO THE PLEASURES AND PAIN OF HUMAN LIFE--BUT ESPECIALLY THE PAIN
FIRST OUTLINE YOUR WHOLE SUBJECT COMPLETELY WITH DELICATE SHARP PENCIL LINE
GRATUITOUSLY DRAWN FIRMLY THE THREE LINES OF STIFF DRIP-STONE WHICH MARK ITS SQUARENESS AND BLANKNESS
YOU SEE HOW INTENSELY TURNER FELT PRECISELY WHAT THE FLEMING DID NOT FEEL--THE BEND OF THE NECK
THE MASS OF FOOLISH PERSONS DIVIDING THEMSELVES ALWAYS BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSITELY AND EQUALLY ERRONEOUS FAITHS THAT GENIUS MAY DISPENSE WITH LAW OR THAT LAW CAN CREATE GENIUS
THE MYTH OF SEMELE DESIRING TO SEE ZEUS AND OF APOLLO AND CORONIS AND THIS HAVING ALL THE SAME MAIN INTEREST
IF YOU DON'T GET MORE THAN THAT LET YOUR OUTLINE BE A FINISHED AND LOVELY DIAGRAM OF THE WHOLE
THERE IS A SPECIAL POINT FOR US TO OBSERVE IN THOSE DARK PEACOCKS
ANIMAL PAINTING INVESTIGATES THE LAWS OF GREATER AND LESS NOBILITY OF CHARACTER IN ORGANIC FORM AS COMPARATIVE ANATOMY EXAMINES THOSE OF GREATER AND LESS DEVELOPMENT IN ORGANIC STRUCTURE
BUT WITHOUT ANY WASH OF COLOR SUCH AN OUTLINE IS THE MOST VALUABLE OF ALL MEANS FOR OBTAINING SUCH MEMORANDA OF ANY SCENE AS MAY EXPLAIN TO ANOTHER PERSON OR RECORD FOR YOURSELF WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN ITS FEATURES
MILL NEAR GRANDE CHARTREUSE
THE FIRST THING THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO LEARN IN LANDSCAPE IS TO OUTLINE
GREEK INDIFFERENCE--DANCING CARELESS--AGAINST GOTHIC PASSION THE MOTHER'S--WHAT WORD CAN I USE EXCEPT FRENZY OF LOVE
THEY WERE NOT PUBLIC LECTURES LIKE PROFESSOR RUSKIN'S OTHER COURSES BUT ADDRESSED ONLY TO UNDERGRADUATES WHO HAD JOINED HIS CLASS
THEY ARE PAINTED BECAUSE THE STATE OF THE SCENE IN ONE CASE IS FULL OF DELIGHT TO MEN
FINISHED FROM CORNER TO CORNER AS WELL AS THE PAINTER EASILY COULD
IT FOLLOWS ALSO FROM THIS LAW OF CONSTRUCTION THAT ANY MASTER WHO CAN COLOR CAN ALWAYS DO ANY PANE OF HIS WINDOW THAT HE LIKES SEPARATELY FROM THE REST
FROM THIS I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO GO INSTANTLY TO REMBRANDT'S PORTRAIT OF A BURGOMASTER NO
IN THE FOREGROUND OF IT INDEED IS THE MARTYRDOM OF PETER MARTYR
FROM THE PAINTING BY TURNER 99
FROM THE BOTTICELLI BY BEING SIMPLE AND CALM
AND AN INTEREST IN DRUNKEN SAILORS WHICH MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS MARINE STUDIES SHOWN NOT LESS IN THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HIND SEAT
BRANTWOOD FROM A PHOTOGRAPH PREFATORY NOTE
EVERY SOUL OF THEM HAD TO UNDERSTAND THE CREATURE AND VERY EARNESTLY
QUESTIONS AS TO THE PURPOSE OF ARRANGEMENTS OR THE USE OF THE ORGANS OF AN ANIMAL ARE HOWEVER NO LESS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE PAINTER THAN OF THE PHYSIOLOGIST AND ARE INDEED MORE LIKELY TO COMMEND THEMSELVES TO YOU THROUGH DRAWING THAN DISSECTION
THERE IS MORE REAL RELATION TO THE GREAT SCHOOLS OF ART MORE FELLOWSHIP WITH BELLINI AND TITIAN IN THE HUMBLEST PAINTER OF LETTERS ON VILLAGE SIGNBOARDS THAN IN MEN LIKE THESE
AND I HAVE EXAMINED--I SPEAK DELIBERATELY--THOUSANDS
IN FORMAL CHIAROSCURO ALL THESE ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS WHITE AND DRAWN AS IF THEY WERE CARVED IN MARBLE
SO THAT IT NEEDS MUCH GREATER STRENGTH OF HEART AND INTELLECT TO PAINT LANDSCAPE THAN FIGURE
THAT EMBOSSED EXECUTION OF REMBRANDT'S IS JUST AS MUCH IGNORANT WORK AS THE EMBOSSED PROJECTING JEWELS OF CARLO CRIVELLI
ONLY NATURAL PHENOMENA IN THEIR DIRECT RELATION TO HUMANITY_--THESE ARE TO BE YOUR SUBJECTS IN LANDSCAPE
NOW YOU OBSERVE THAT I NEVER SPEAK OF THIS GREEK SCHOOL BUT WITH A CERTAIN DREAD
COLOR 32 LIST OF PLATES PAGE VESUVIUS IN ERUPTION BY J.M.W
HE WAS WARPED FROM COLOR BY HIS LOWER GREEK INSTINCTS BY HIS ANIMAL DELIGHT IN COARSE AND VIOLENT FORMS AND SCENES--IN FIGHTING IN HUNTING AND IN TORMENTS OF MARTYRDOM AND OF HELL
THESE ARE NOT FINISHED PICTURES BUT STUDIES
IN THE DAYS OF RUBENS YOU MUST REMEMBER MYTHOLOGY WAS THOUGHT OF AS A MERE EMPTY FORM OF COMPLIMENT OR FABLE AND THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF IT WHOLLY FORGOTTEN
THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE SO AT THEIR EASE HAD THE RIVER NOT BEEN HUMANIZED
IN MY INAUGURAL LECTURE,[1 I STATED THAT WHILE HOLDING THIS PROFESSORSHIP I SHOULD DIRECT YOU IN YOUR PRACTICAL EXERCISES CHIEFLY TO NATURAL HISTORY AND LANDSCAPE
THIS WAS ONLY PAINTED BY HIM--AND IS IN REALITY ONLY PLEASANT TO YOU--BECAUSE IT SIGNIFIES THE COMING OF A GLEAM OF SWEET SUNSHINE IN WINDY WEATHER
ANOTHER LITTLE VAN EYCK IN THE LOUVRE
AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN--CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH--ALL THE SAME LOOK AT HIM BESIDE MICHAEL ANGELO'S AND THEN TELL ME THE VENETIANS CAN'T DRAW
THE CHIEF AIM OF GOTHIC ART WAS PASSIONATE REST A PEACE AN ETERNITY OF INTENSE SENTIMENT
ABOVE ALL THE FLESHLINESS AND MATERIALISM WHICH MAKE HIS STUDIES OF THE NUDE IN MY JUDGMENT ALTOGETHER INADMISSIBLE INTO THE RANK OF THE FINE ARTS
AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING--UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
EXCEPT ONLY THAT FROM THE BEGINNING I RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH ALWAYS FOR SUNRISE
THEN THE REST OF THE TREATMENT HE LEARNED FROM OTHER SCHOOLS BUT ADOPTED WITH SPLENDID POWER
BUT FAR MORE THAN COMMON PASSION IS NECESSARY TO PAINT LANDSCAPE
NAY IN ALL PROBABILITY YOUR EYES ARE SO SATIATED BY THE FALSE POPULAR ART SURROUNDING US NOW ON ALL SIDES THAT YOU CANNOT SEE THE DELICATE REALITY THOUGH YOU TRY
IN HER HE HAS PUT OUT HIS FULL POWER UNDER THE TEACHING OF VERONESE AND TITIAN
AND THEREFORE IT IS AMONG MANY OTHER REASONS THAT I PUT THE BRUSH INTO YOUR HANDS FROM THE FIRST AND TRY YOU WITH A WASH IN LAMPBLACK BEFORE YOU ENTER MY WORKING CLASS
EKSTASIS TO GREEK ACTION AND GREEK
BUT ON ASKING A GREAT PHYSIOLOGIST I FOUND THAT IT APPEARED TO HIM AN ABSURD QUESTION AND WAS CERTAINLY AN UNANSWERABLE ONE
THE GREEK CHIAROSCURO I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU IS BY ONE BODY OF MEN PURSUED ACADEMICALLY AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSING FORM
BY MOTION FIRST
AN ILL-BRED DOG STANDS JOYLESS BY THE UNFENCED STREAM
THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THOUGHTFUL AND HAVE EACH THEIR FIXED PURPOSE TO WHICH EVERYTHING ELSE IS SACRIFICED
THE DEGREE OF IT YOU CANNOT COMMAND
WELL THE FIRST REASON THAT I GAVE YOU THESE LOIRE DRAWINGS WAS THIS OF THEIR INFALLIBLE DECISION
AS I GO INTO DETAIL I SHALL CONTINUALLY THEREFORE HAVE TO OPPOSE GOTHIC PASSION TO GREEK TEMPERANCE
71
80
RUBENS NEVER DREAMED THAT ARGUS IS THE NIGHT OR THAT HIS EYES ARE STARS
AND IT FOLLOWS ALSO FROM THIS LAW OF CONSTRUCTION THAT THERE MUST NEVER BE ANY HESITATION OR REPENTANCE IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR LINES OF LIMIT
I COULD NOT GET THE CURVES OF THE LEAVES AND THEY ARE PATCHED AND SPOILED
THAT IS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THESE TWO STUDIES
IN THE NOBLE DRAWING OF THE DEAD BODY AND OF THE BIRDS YOU HAVE THE PHIDIAS-GREEK PART OF IT BROUGHT DOWN TO RUBENS THROUGH MICHAEL ANGELO
ALL THE OBJECTS ARE THEN TO BE PAINTED OF THEIR PROPER COLORS MATCHING THEM AS NEARLY AS YOU CAN IN THE MANNER THAT A MISSAL IS PAINTED FILLING THE OUTLINED SHAPES NEATLY UP TO THEIR JUNCTIONS
AND IN GENERAL OUTLINE SO SUBTLE AND ELABORATE AS TO BE INEXHAUSTIBLE IN EXAMINATION AND UNCOPIABLE FOR DELICACY
NOTHING IN HASTE OR AFFECTATION NOTHING IN FEVERISH OR MORBID EXCITEMENT
THEY TURNED THE CLOUDS AND THE LIGHTNING OF MOUNT ITHOME INTO THE HUMAN FLESH AND EAGLE UPON THE EXTENDED ARM OF THE MESSENIAN ZEUS
LOOK FOR YOURSELVES AT THE STORY OF PROCRIS AS RELATED TO MINOS IN THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER OF THE THIRD BOOK OF APOLLODORUS
FOOTNOTE 9
THE FIRST GREAT OBJECT OF THE LIBER STUDIORUM FOR WHICH I REQUESTED YOU IN MY SIXTH LECTURE[7 TO MAKE CONSTANT USE OF IT IS THE DELINEATION OF SOLID FORM BY OUTLINE AND SHADOW
HE HAS NOT GIVEN YOU ONE BRIGHT GLEAM OF GREEN OR PURPLE IN ALL THE TWO BIRDS
BUT HE HATES DARKNESS AS HE DOES DEATH
I WAS SENDING OUT THE OTHER DAY TO A FRIEND IN AMERICA A CHOSEN GROUP OF THE LIBER STUDIORUM TO FORM A NUCLEUS FOR AN ART COLLECTION AT BOSTON
IT IS NOT OF THE SLIGHTEST USE
III
AND YOU MAY ALWAYS CONSIDER YOUR PEN LINE AS REPRESENTING THE FIRST INCISION FOR SCULPTURE THE TRUE LIMIT BEING THE SHARP CENTER OF THE INCISION
IT IS A GOOD AND VALUABLE BOOK IN MANY WAYS AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME COPIES SET YOU FROM IT
YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES SPEAK OF THESE GENERALLY AS THE GOTHIC AND GREEK SCHOOLS SOMETIMES AS THE COLORIST AND CHIAROSCURIST
AT ONCE YOU ARE OUT OF THE OPEN DAYLIGHT EITHER IN SUNSHINE ADMITTED PARTIALLY THROUGH TREMBLING LEAVES OR IN THE LAST RAYS OF ITS SETTING SCARCELY ANY MORE WARM ON THE DARKNESS OF THE ILEX WOOD
LECTURES ON ART THE INAUGURAL COURSE 1870 SEC
BUT PLEASE NOTE IN THEM ONE THING ESPECIALLY
ALL THE TRADITIONS OF THE GREEK HILLS IN THEIR PURITY WERE FOUNDED ON SUCH ROCKS AND SHADOWS AS THESE
JUST BECAUSE THOUGH MYSELF TRAINED WHOLLY IN THE CHIAROSCURO SCHOOLS I KNOW THE VALUE OF COLOR
THE SUBJECT PHYSICALLY IS A MERE BANK OF GRASS ABOVE A STREAM WITH SOME WYCH-ELMS AND WILLOWS
