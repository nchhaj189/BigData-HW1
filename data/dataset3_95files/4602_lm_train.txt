BUT THE THING HAS GONE TOO FAR
SOME OF THESE MEN ARE SENT TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM SOME ARE ENROLLED AS CLERKS AND TRANSFERRED TO SIBERIA SOME ARE SENT TO WORK IN THE FORESTS SOME ARE SENT TO PRISON SOME ARE FINED
HERESY IS THE OBVERSE SIDE OF THE CHURCH
THERE MAY BE BAD MEN AMONG THOSE WHO ARE RULED BUT IT CANNOT BE THAT THOSE WHO ARE BETTER HAVE GENERALLY RULED THOSE WHO ARE WORSE
ALL STATE OBLIGATIONS ARE AGAINST THE CONSCIENCE OF A CHRISTIAN--THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TAXES LAW PROCEEDINGS AND MILITARY SERVICE
IN THE SOLDIERS BY THE DIRECT CONSCIOUS HYPNOTIZING EXERTED BY THE HIGHER CLASSES
IF THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT IF THEY THEMSELVES PASSED JUDGMENT ON MURDEROUS GOVERNMENTS IF THEY REFUSED TO LET THEMSELVES BE KILLED FOR NOTHING IF THEY WOULD ONLY TURN THEIR ARMS AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEM TO THEM FOR MASSACRE ON THAT DAY WAR WOULD BE NO MORE
ONE CANNOT GIVE AWAY ALL TO THE POOR BUT ONE MUST GIVE AWAY A CERTAIN DEFINITE PART
A VERY GREAT DEAL WAS SAID BUT NOT A WORD ABOUT THE ONE THING WHICH FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUESTION IN LIFE--HOW TO RECONCILE THE DUTY OF FORGIVENESS MEEKNESS PATIENCE AND LOVE FOR ALL NEIGHBORS AND ENEMIES ALIKE WHICH IS SO CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS OF OUR TEACHER AND IN THE HEART OF EACH OF US--HOW TO RECONCILE THIS DUTY WITH THE OBLIGATION OF USING FORCE IN WAR UPON MEN OF OUR OWN OR A FOREIGN PEOPLE
THE POLICEMAN TURNED HIS HORSE AND WENT OFF WITHOUT A WORD
BUT THE BEST EXPRESSION OF THIS ATTITUDE IS THE VIEW OF THE MOST GIFTED OF THE WRITERS OF THIS SCHOOL THE ACADEMICIAN DE VOGUE
AND I WAS LED TO FRESH RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS WHICH I WISH NOW TO EXPOUND
I SHALL BE DRESSED UP LIKE A CLOWN I SHALL BE AT THE BECK AND CALL OF EVERY MAN OF A HIGHER GRADE THAN MY OWN FROM CORPORAL TO FIELD-MARSHAL SHALL BE PUT THROUGH ANY BODILY CONTORTIONS AT THEIR PLEASURE AND AFTER BEING KEPT FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS I SHALL HAVE FOR TEN YEARS AFTERWARD TO BE IN READINESS TO UNDERTAKE ALL OF IT AGAIN AT ANY MINUTE
THE SPIRIT OF JACOBINISM IS THE SPIRIT OF RETALIATION VIOLENCE AND MURDER
HE READS AND THEY REPEAT AFTER HIM
THE FACT THAT SO MANY VARIED FORMS OF EXISTENCE AS THE LIFE OF THE FAMILY OF THE TRIBE OF THE CLAN OF THE STATE AND EVEN THE LIFE OF HUMANITY THEORETICALLY CONCEIVED BY THE POSITIVISTS ARE FOUNDED ON THIS SOCIAL OR PAGAN THEORY OF LIFE DOES NOT DESTROY THE UNITY OF THIS THEORY OF LIFE
THEY SHOW ONLY WHAT AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY MEN MAY NOT DO
FOR HE IS WORKING AT THE MANUFACTURE OF THINGS WHICH HE WILL NOT ENJOY WORKING NOT BY HIS OWN WILL FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT BUT THROUGH NECESSITY TO SATISFY THE DESIRES OF LUXURIOUS AND IDLE PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND FOR THE PROFIT OF A SINGLE RICH MAN THE OWNER OF A FACTORY OR WORKSHOP IN PARTICULAR
IT TOOK AGES THOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO PERMEATE MEN'S CONSCIOUSNESS
IT IS JUST THIS FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE PEACEFUL PROFESSIONS AND THE WARLIKE POLICY OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH ALL GOOD CITIZENS DESIRE TO PUT AN END TO AT ANY COST PEOPLE ARE ASTONISHED THAT EVERY YEAR THERE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND CASES OF SUICIDE IN EUROPE AND THOSE ONLY THE RECOGNIZED AND RECORDED CASES--AND EXCLUDING RUSSIA AND TURKEY
ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
FOR NOTHING LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CHURCH AS WE KNOW IT NOW WITH ITS SACRAMENTS MIRACLES AND ABOVE ALL ITS CLAIM TO INFALLIBILITY IS TO BE FOUND EITHER IN CHRIST'S WORDS OR IN THE IDEAS OF THE MEN OF THAT TIME
BUT IN SPITE OF THIS GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE RUSH TO THE GREATEST EXTREMES OF SENSELESSNESS
AND CASES OF REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH THE DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY ARE OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY AND ESPECIALLY CASES OF REFUSING TO SERVE IN THE ARMY ARE OCCURRING OF LATE NOT IN RUSSIA ONLY BUT EVERYWHERE
J
THE MORE DELICATE A MAN'S CONSCIENCE IS THE MORE PAINFUL THIS CONTRADICTION IS TO HIM
THE PEOPLE DID CERTAINLY AT ONE TIME BELIEVE IN SOMETHING LIKE WHAT THE CHURCH BELIEVES IN NOW THOUGH IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE SAME THING
XXIII
XXIII
EVEN IF THERE WERE ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF THEM THEY WOULD RARELY EXPERIENCE ANYTHING WORSE THAN THE WORLD'S CONTEMPT AND MEANTIME THE WORLD THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS OF IT AND NOT GRATEFUL FOR IT WOULD BE CONTINUALLY BECOMING WISER AND BETTER FOR THEIR UNSEEN ACTION ON IT
THEY KNOW IT AND THEY SAY SO PLAINLY
IT WAS ONLY WHEN BELIEVERS WERE SPLIT UP INTO OPPOSING PARTIES RENOUNCING ONE ANOTHER THAT IT SEEMED NECESSARY TO EACH PARTY TO CONFIRM THEIR OWN TRUTH BY ASCRIBING TO THEMSELVES INFALLIBILITY
THE PROPOSITIONS OF M
AND THEREFORE KNOWING THAT YOUR POSITION IS REPUGNANT TO YOUR HEART AND YOUR HEAD AND TO YOUR FAITH AND EVEN TO THE SCIENCE IN WHICH YOU BELIEVE YOU CANNOT HELP REFLECTING UPON THE QUESTION WHETHER IN RETAINING IT AND ABOVE ALL TRYING TO JUSTIFY IT YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO
BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF CHRONIC PERMANENT INTOXICATION TO WHICH THOSE ARE LIABLE WHO HAVE ANY KIND OF AUTHORITY FROM THAT OF THE TZAR TO THAT OF THE LOWEST POLICE OFFICER AT THE STREET CORNER AND ALSO THOSE WHO ARE IN SUBJECTION TO AUTHORITY AND IN A STATE OF STUPEFIED SERVILITY
NOT AT ALL
AND SO WE SEE THIS MAN THE HARSH SLAVE-DRIVER OF THOUSANDS OF MEN BUILDING ALMSHOUSES WITH LITTLE GARDENS TWO YARDS SQUARE FOR THE WORKMEN BROKEN DOWN IN TOILING FOR HIM AND A BANK AND A POORHOUSE AND A HOSPITAL--FULLY PERSUADED THAT HE HAS AMPLY EXPIATED IN THIS WAY FOR ALL THE HUMAN LIVES MORALLY AND PHYSICALLY RUINED BY HIM--AND CALMLY GOING ON WITH HIS BUSINESS TAKING PRIDE IN IT
EVERYONE FELT AWKWARD NONE KNEW WHERE TO LOOK BUT NO ONE CONTRADICTED HER
IF IN A FORMER AGE IN THE ROMAN TIMES IT HAPPENED THAT A CHRISTIAN CONFESSED HIS RELIGION AND REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN SACRIFICES AND TO WORSHIP THE EMPERORS OR THE GODS
THE UNIVERSAL HYPOCRISY HAS SO ENTERED INTO THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF ALL CLASSES OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY IT HAS REACHED SUCH A PITCH THAT NOTHING IN THAT WAY CAN ROUSE INDIGNATION
THE ORDER WAS NOT EASILY EXECUTED
AND ALSO A RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO THE LORD MAYOR AND LADY MAYORESS TO MR PASSMORE EDWARDS AND OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAVE EXTENDED THEIR HOSPITALITY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS
BUT BESIDES CORRUPTING PUBLIC OPINION THE USE OF FORCE LEADS MEN TO THE FATAL CONVICTION THAT THEY PROGRESS NOT THROUGH THE SPIRITUAL IMPULSE WHICH IMPELS THEM TO THE ATTAINMENT OF TRUTH AND ITS REALIZATION IN LIFE AND WHICH CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOURCE OF EVERY PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY BUT BY MEANS OF VIOLENCE THE VERY FORCE WHICH FAR FROM LEADING MEN TO TRUTH ALWAYS CARRIES THEM FURTHER AWAY FROM IT
AT THE TOP OF THE SCALE--THE TZARS PRESIDENTS MINISTERS AND PARLIAMENTS DECREE THESE TORTURES AND MURDERS AND MILITARY CONSCRIPTION AND ARE FULLY CONVINCED THAT SINCE THEY ARE EITHER PLACED IN AUTHORITY BY THE GRACE OF GOD OR BY THE SOCIETY THEY GOVERN WHICH DEMANDS SUCH DECREES FROM THEM THEY CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY ON WHICH ALL THE REST DEPENDS SEEMS TO THEM IMMACULATE BEYOND SUSPICION
WHAT SHOULD WE SAY OF A MAN WHO WANTING TO SHOW HIS FRIENDLY FEELINGS FOR HIS NEIGHBOR SHOULD INVITE HIM TO DISCUSS THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH A LOADED REVOLVER IN HIS HAND
OPPOSING EVIL BY FORCE IS EQUIVALENT TO SUICIDE ON THEIR PART--THE ABOLITION OF STATE-VIOLENCE CANNOT INCREASE THE SUM TOTAL OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE--THE SUPPRESSION OF THE USE OF FORCE IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT IS EVEN TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES--BUT IT WILL NEVER BE SUPPRESSED BY THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT BUT THROUGH MEN WHO HAVE ATTAINED POWER BY EVIDENCE RECOGNIZING ITS EMPTINESS AND BECOMING BETTER AND LESS CAPABLE OF USING FORCE--INDIVIDUAL MEN AND ALSO WHOLE NATIONS PASS THROUGH THIS PROCESS--BY THIS MEANS CHRISTIANITY IS DIFFUSED THROUGH CONSCIOUSNESS OF MEN NOT ONLY IN SPITE OF USE OF VIOLENCE BY GOVERNMENT BUT EVEN THROUGH ITS ACTION AND THEREFORE THE SUPPRESSION IS NOT TO BE DREADED BUT IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE NATIONAL PROGRESS OF LIFE--OBJECTION OF THOSE WHO DEFEND STATE ORGANIZATION THAT UNIVERSAL ADOPTION OF CHRISTIANITY IS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE REALIZED AT ANY TIME--THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF THE TRUTHS OF CHRISTIANITY IS BEING BROUGHT ABOUT NOT ONLY BY THE GRADUAL AND
THEY PUT HIM INTO THE UNIFORM ENROL HIM AND SEND HIM UNDER GUARD TO THE PLACE WHERE THE ARMY IS QUARTERED
DOES IT COMPEL THEM TO GO AND IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE PUNISH THEM
MEN OF MEDIEVAL TIMES--EVEN UP TO THE END OF THE LAST AND BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY--MIGHT CONTINUE TO HOLD THIS BELIEF
BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE
ALL MODERN LITERATURE--PHILOSOPHICAL POLITICAL AND ARTISTIC--IS STRIKING IN THIS RESPECT
THEY DO NOT EXPECT WORLDLY BLESSINGS AND WORLDLY HAPPINESS BUT THEY EXPECT ETERNAL LIFE
HE NOT ONLY CANNOT OBEY THE CHANGING LAWS OF MAN BUT HE CANNOT EVEN PROMISE TO DO ANYTHING DEFINITE AT A CERTAIN TIME OR TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING ANYTHING FOR A CERTAIN TIME
THE VERY USE OF THE WORD HERESY SEEMS AN ATTACK UPON LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE AND THOUGHT
IT CONDEMNS EVERY FORM OF PROFLIGACY WHETHER WITH CONCUBINE SLAVE DIVORCED WOMAN OR EVEN ONE'S OWN WIFE
OUR LABOR IS LIKE THAT OF SAILORS EXECUTING THEIR LAST TASK AS THE SHIP BEGINS TO SINK
UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE WAS AN INEVITABLE LOGICAL NECESSITY TO WHICH WE WERE BOUND TO COME
THEY SEEK CONFIRMATION OF THEIR OWN DOCTRINE IN THE GOSPEL ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE TWO DOCTRINES ARE REALLY THE SAME
CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY BELIEVERS IV
WOE TO YOU THAT ARE RICH
I WISH NONE THE LESS FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART THAT THE CONGRESS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE MAY SUCCEED AT LAST IN ITS VERY HONORABLE AND DIFFICULT ENTERPRISE
AND HOW ARE WE TO SUPPRESS BY FORCE ACTS COMMITTED IN THE MIDST OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH ARE REGARDED AS CRIMES BY THE GOVERNMENT AND AS DARING EXPLOITS BY THE PEOPLE
THIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE AT FIRST OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE AND AFTERWARD OF THE COMPLETE DISTORTION OF IT
BUT NOW IT IS NO LONGER SO
PRECISELY THE SAME THING IS SAID IN OTHER WORDS IN ALL CODES OF MILITARY INSTRUCTION
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE CANNOT BE DEFINITE LAWS AND RULES FOR THIS FULFILLMENT OF THE TEACHING
WITH GOOD REASON IS THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH THE HISTORY OF THE GREATEST CRUELTIES AND HORRORS
THEY ARE SHUT UP TOGETHER IN BARRACKS DRESSED IN SPECIAL CLOTHES AND WORKED UPON BY CRIES DRUMS MUSIC AND SHINING OBJECTS TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN DAILY ACTIONS INVENTED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND BY THIS MEANS ARE BROUGHT INTO AN HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN WHICH THEY CEASE TO BE MEN AND BECOME MERE SENSELESS MACHINES SUBMISSIVE TO THE HYPNOTIZER
HERE WE HAVE EACH TO GO AND KILL OR BE KILLED THERE THEY HAVE EACH TO GIVE THE FRUIT OF THEIR TOIL TO PAY FOR THE RECRUITING AND TRAINING OF SOLDIERS THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN LIFE AND CONSCIENCE AND THE MISERY RESULTING FROM IT HAVE REACHED THE EXTREME LIMIT AND CAN GO NO FURTHER
HIS INTEREST IN LIFE IS CONCENTRATED ON HIMSELF ALONE
AT PRESENT ONE WOULD RATHER SAY ON THE CONTRARY THAT THE ACTION OF THE STATE WITH ITS CRUEL METHODS OF PUNISHMENT BEHIND THE GENERAL MORAL STANDARD OF THE AGE SUCH AS PRISONS GALLEYS GIBBETS AND GUILLOTINES TENDS RATHER TO BRUTALIZE THE PEOPLE THAN TO CIVILIZE THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY RATHER TO INCREASE THAN DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF MALEFACTORS
BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND CANNOT BE OTHERWISE
IT HAS NO EXISTENCE IN REALITY
BUT HUMANITY AS A CONCRETE IDEA DOES NOT AND CANNOT EXIST
THE CONGRESS AFTER GATHERING TOGETHER FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS THE VERBAL AND WRITTEN OPINION OF LEARNED MEN OPENED THE PROCEEDINGS BY A RELIGIOUS SERVICE AND AFTER LISTENING TO ADDRESSES FOR FIVE WHOLE DAYS CONCLUDED THEM BY A PUBLIC DINNER AND SPEECHES
WE ARE DYING OF HUNGER SO AS TO SECURE THE MEANS OF KILLING EACH OTHER SPEAKING LATER ON OF THE WAY THE SUBJECT IS LOOKED AT IN FRANCE HE SAYS
18 21
CHAPTER VIII
FURTHER IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIM IN HIS LIFE THAT HE MUST OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING RULES
ALL THE TRUTH THERE WAS IN THEM WILL ONLY BE STRONGER AND MORE FLOURISHING
BUT OF COURSE AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND PLACE MEN ALWAYS BELIEVE IN SOMETHING OR OTHER
THE IDEA THAT WE COULD GET ON WITHOUT WAR WAS REGARDED AS UNMITIGATED WEAKNESS AND FOLLY THE CATHOLIC PRIEST DEFOURNEY HAS EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN THE SAME SPIRIT
SUBTLETIES ALLEGORIES HUMOROUS FANCIES THE WIDEST GENERALIZATIONS BUT NOTHING SIMPLE AND CLEAR NOTHING GOING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THAT IS TO THE PROBLEM OF LIFE
THEY WILL MARCH TO BATTLE TRAMPLING UNDERFOOT THE HARVESTS THEY HAVE SOWN BURNING THE TOWNS THEY HAVE BUILT--WITH SONGS OF TRIUMPH FESTIVE MUSIC AND CRIES OF JUBILATION
WE CANNOT GIVE UP THE USE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE WE ARE SURROUNDED BY VIOLENT RUFFIANS NOTHING IN OUR DAYS HINDERS THE PROGRESS OF HUMANITY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION CORRESPONDING TO ITS PRESENT DEVELOPMENT MORE THAN THIS FALSE REASONING
I SHOULD BE VERY HAPPY IF THE CONGRESS WOULD PROVE ME IN ERROR
THERE IS THE SAME EXTERNAL RITUAL THE SAME RELICS MIRACLES AND WONDER-WORKING IMAGES OF NOTRE DAME AND THE SAME PROCESSIONS
THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO CHURCHES DIRECTLY THIS CLAIM WAS MADE
THIS RESULT IS ATTAINED BY TAKING THEM AT THE YOUTHFUL AGE WHEN MEN HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO FORM CLEAR AND DEFINITE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS AND REMOVING THEM FROM ALL NATURAL AND HUMAN CONDITIONS OF LIFE HOME FAMILY AND KINDRED AND USEFUL LABOR
BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHILE PUBLIC OPINION CENSURES AND CONDEMNS ALL THE ACTS OPPOSED TO THE MORAL LAW INCLUDING THE MOST VARIED CASES IN ITS REPROBATION THE LAW WHICH RESTS ON VIOLENCE ONLY CONDEMNS AND PUNISHES A CERTAIN VERY LIMITED RANGE OF ACTS AND BY SO DOING SEEMS TO JUSTIFY ALL OTHER ACTS OF THE SAME KIND WHICH DO NOT COME UNDER ITS SCOPE
CHAPTER II
BUT SO SOON AS THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND AUTHORITY THAT IS VIOLENCE WAS NEEDED TO RESTRAIN THEM THEN THE DISINTEGRATING PRINCIPLE OF THE COERCION OF ONE SET OF PEOPLE BY ANOTHER SET ENTERED INTO THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF THE ORGANIZATION BASED ON IT
EXECUTIONERS REFUSE TO PERFORM THEIR FUNCTIONS SO THAT IN RUSSIA THE DEATH PENALTY CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT FOR WANT OF EXECUTIONERS
OR THE WORSE THAN USELESSNESS AND INJUSTICE THE POSITIVE INSANITY AND BARBARITY OF PREPARATIONS FOR WAR AND OF WARS CAUSING DEVASTATION AND RUIN AND HAVING NO KIND OF JUSTIFICATION
WHOEVER I MAY BE WHETHER I BELONG TO THE WELL-TO-DO CLASS OF THE OPPRESSORS OR THE WORKING CLASS OF THE OPPRESSED IN EITHER CASE THE DISADVANTAGES OF NON-COMPLIANCE ARE LESS AND ITS ADVANTAGES GREATER THAN THOSE OF COMPLIANCE
THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE UPPER CLASSES IS A CONSTANT INCONSISTENCY
CHAPTER III
TO LET SUCH A REFUSAL PASS UNPUNISHED IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THE YOUNG MAN IS PUT ON HIS TRIAL FOR BREACH OF DISCIPLINE
THE SUPERIOR OFFICER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ORDER HE GIVES
LES INFIDELES LES HERETIQUES LES SCHISMATIQUES FOOTNOTE
THE RULING AUTHORITIES SEE THIS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR HOURS ARE NUMBERED AND THEY CAN DO NOTHING
THE DIVISION OF MEN INTO TWO CASTES AS WELL AS THE USE OF FORCE IN GOVERNMENT AND WAR ARE OPPOSED TO EVERY MORAL PRINCIPLE PROFESSED BY OUR MODERN SOCIETY
AND INDEED WHAT SORT OF ETHICAL DOCTRINE COULD ADMIT THE LEGITIMACY OF MURDER FOR ANY OBJECT WHATEVER
AND THEREFORE IN OUR DAYS EVERY PROFESSION OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY BY ANY INDIVIDUAL MAN STRIKES AT THE MOST ESSENTIAL POWER OF THE STATE AND INEVITABLY LEADS THE WAY FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF ALL
IT IS JUST AS THOUGH DRUNKARDS WHEN ADVISED HOW THEY COULD BE BROUGHT TO HABITS OF SOBRIETY SHOULD ANSWER THAT THE ADVICE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR HABIT OF TAKING ALCOHOL
RESISTANCE WAS OFFERED TO THE AUTHORITIES
BUT THOSE WHO COMMIT THE SAME THEFTS ROBBERIES MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES DISGUISING THEM UNDER ALL KINDS OF RELIGIOUS OR SCIENTIFIC OR HUMANITARIAN JUSTIFICATIONS AS ALL LANDOWNERS MERCHANTS MANUFACTURERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DO PROVOKE OTHERS TO IMITATION AND SO DO HARM NOT ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY THE VICTIMS OF THEIR CRIMES BUT TO THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF MEN WHOM THEY CORRUPT BY OBLITERATING THEIR SENSE OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG
WHY SHOULD I GO TO THE LAW COURTS TO TAKE PART IN THE TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF MEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED KNOWING IF I AM A CHRISTIAN THAT THE LAW OF VENGEANCE IS REPLACED BY THE LAW OF LOVE AND IF I AM AN EDUCATED MAN THAT PUNISHMENTS DO NOT REFORM BUT ONLY DEPRAVE THOSE ON WHOM THEY ARE INFLICTED
EVEN IF A FEW ONLY COME TO THEMSELVES AND BOLDLY EXPLAIN TO THE OTHERS ALL THE WICKEDNESS OF SUCH A CRIME THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FEW MAY ROUSE THE OTHERS TO SHAKE OFF THE CONTROLLING SUGGESTION AND THE ATROCITY WILL NOT BE PERPETRATED
THE BOY STAYS IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL TILL HE IS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN AND THEN HIS FRIENDS SEND HIM INTO THE ARMY
PEOPLE NEED ONLY COME TO BE AS MUCH ASHAMED TO DO DEEDS OF VIOLENCE TO ASSIST IN THEM OR TO PROFIT BY THEM AS THEY NOW ARE OF BEING OR BEING REPUTED A SWINDLER A THIEF A COWARD OR A BEGGAR
AS THE POSITIONS BASED ON THE RULE OF FORCE BECOME LESS ATTRACTIVE AND FEWER MEN ARE FOUND WILLING TO FILL THEM THE MORE WILL THEIR USELESSNESS BE APPARENT
IT IS BETTER FOR ONE MAN TO DIE THAN THAT THE WHOLE PEOPLE PERISH YOU WILL SAY LIKE CAIAPHAS AND YOU SIGN THE SENTENCE OF DEATH OF ONE MAN OF A SECOND AND A THIRD
BUT THEY ARE LIVING IN A WORLD WHICH PROFESSES THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL THAT ALL ARE ALIKE SONS OF GOD AND SO BROTHERS AND EQUAL
THIS PRIMITIVE CHURCH WAS HIS SPECIAL IDEAL OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION FOUNDED ON EQUALITY LIBERTY AND FRATERNITY
IN THE AUTUMN THE EXTERNAL LIFELESSNESS IN NATURE CORRESPONDS WITH ITS INWARD CONDITION OF DEATH WHILE IN THE SPRING THE EXTERNAL LIFELESSNESS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE INTERNAL STATE OF REVIVING AND PASSING INTO NEW FORMS OF LIFE

YES YOU MEAN TO SAY THIS AND THAT THIS CORRECTION IS ALWAYS WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING THE TEACHING OF THE HIGHER DIVINE CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO THE LEVEL OF THE LOWER STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE
AND IN FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY SUCCEED IN OVERTHROWING THEM OR WHAT IS MORE COMMON THEY RISE INTO THE RANKS OF THE OPPRESSORS AND ASSIST IN THEIR ACTS OF VIOLENCE
ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY ONE CAN REMAIN A LANDOWNER MERCHANT MANUFACTURER JUDGE OFFICIAL IN GOVERNMENT PAY OFFICER OR SOLDIER AND STILL BE NOT ONLY A HUMANE MAN BUT EVEN A SOCIALIST AND REVOLUTIONIST
COMMENDING IT TO THE REASON AND CONSCIENCE OF MANKIND AND RESOLVING IN THE STRENGTH OF THE LORD GOD TO CALMLY AND MEEKLY ABIDE THE ISSUE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS DECLARATION A SOCIETY FOR NON-RESISTANCE WAS FOUNDED BY GARRISON AND A JOURNAL CALLED THE NON-RESISTANT IN WHICH THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE WAS ADVOCATED IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE AND IN ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES AS IT HAD BEEN EXPOUNDED IN THE DECLARATION
EUROPE THEN IS IN THIS RESPECT IN SPITE OF ALL THE CONQUESTS OF SCIENCE IN THE SAME POSITION AS IN THE DARKEST AND MOST BARBAROUS DAYS OF THE MIDDLE AGES
HUMANITY
TO CONFESS MEANS TO GO TO THE CHURCH AND TO TELL THE PRIEST HIS SINS ON THE THEORY THAT THIS INFORMING A STRANGER OF HIS SINS COMPLETELY PURIFIES HIM FROM THEM
BUT CHRIST REJECTS ALL THIS
THIS FACULTY OF FORESEEING THE PATH ALONG WHICH HUMANITY MUST MOVE IS COMMON IN A GREATER OR LESS DEGREE TO ALL MEN
THE REVOLUTIONISTS WERE INDIGNANT AT THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HINDERING THE OVERTHROW OF THE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE RUINING THE NATIONAL PROSPERITY
IN NOTHING IS THE PITCH OF INCONSISTENCY MODERN LIFE HAS ATTAINED TO SO EVIDENT AS IN UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION WHICH IS THE LAST RESOURCE AND THE FINAL EXPRESSION OF VIOLENCE
BUT THREE OR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THEY SEEMED TO REQUIRE WHAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
AND THIS IS JUST HOW IT IS
AND IT IS A MISTAKEN IDEA THAT SUCH A CRISIS MIGHT DELIVER US FROM THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL TROUBLES THAT ARE CRUSHING US
USE EVERY EFFORT TO MAKE THEIR APPLICATION UNNECESSARY
AND LET NO ONE SAY THAT THE ORTHODOX TEACHERS PLACE THE ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR TEACHING IN SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT ALL THESE ARE ONLY ANCIENT FORMS WHICH IT IS NOT THOUGHT NECESSARY TO DO AWAY WITH
IN SOME CASES MISSING PUNCTUATION IN A SERIES WAS CORRECTED WHERE EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SERIES IS PUNCTUATED
THIS USE OF HYPNOTIZING INFLUENCE ON MEN TO BRING THEM TO A STATE OF STUPEFACTION IS ESPECIALLY APPARENT IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SALVATION ARMY WHO EMPLOY NEW PRACTICES TO WHICH WE ARE UNACCUSTOMED
CRITICISMS OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE ON THE PART OF BELIEVERS AND OF UNBELIEVERS III
THE MORE WIDELY CHRISTIANITY WAS DIFFUSED AND THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNPREPARED FOR IT WHO WERE BROUGHT UNDER ITS SWAY THE LESS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THE MORE ABSOLUTELY WAS ITS INFALLIBILITY INSISTED ON AND THE LESS POSSIBLE IT BECAME TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF THE DOCTRINE
WE ARE JUST LIKE IGNORANT DOCTORS WHO PUT A MAN RECOVERING FROM ILLNESS BY THE FORCE OF NATURE INTO THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS OF HYGIENE AND DOSE HIM WITH THE MOST DELETERIOUS DRUGS AND THEN ASSERT TRIUMPHANTLY THAT THEIR HYGIENE AND THEIR DRUGS SAVED HIS LIFE WHEN THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL LONG BEFORE IF THEY HAD LEFT HIM ALONE
I THINK WAR IS TERRIBLE BUT THAT IT IS INEVITABLE
THE GERMANS HAVE DOMINATED THE ITALIANS NOW THEY DOMINATE THE HUNGARIANS AND SLAVONIANS
THE CHRISTIAN CANNOT BUT PREACH ON THAT SUBJECT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE
AS THOUGH WE HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT WE KNEW AND PUT AWAY FOR A TIME THE PRINCIPLES WE BELIEVE IN WE CANNOT HELP STILL BELIEVING IN THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY FOUNDATION WE HAVE TO BASE OUR LIFE ON WE DO THE VERY OPPOSITE OF ALL THAT OUR CONSCIENCE AND OUR COMMON SENSE REQUIRE OF US
SIMILARLY THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPE FOR MEN IF EACH WERE NOT A LIVING BEING ENDOWED WITH THE FACULTY OF ENTERING INTO THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE
THE JEW MIGHT WELL OBEY HIS LAWS SINCE HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT GOD HAD WRITTEN THEM WITH HIS FINGER
AND MEANWHILE THOUGH THIS IS THE ONE ONLY MEANS OF GAINING A HOLD OVER THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REMAINED NON-CHRISTIAN THE MEN OF OUR DAY SET TO WORK IN THE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE FASHION TO ATTAIN THIS RESULT
AND THEREFORE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT HIS PRECEPTS CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD LITERALLY AS A COMPLETE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE
THEY CAN SHUT THEIR EYES AND FORCE THEIR CONSCIENCE TO BE STILL BUT SO LONG AS THEIR EYES ARE OPENED AND THEIR CONSCIENCE UNDULLED THEY MUST ALL--THOSE WHO CARRY OUT AND THOSE WHO PROFIT BY THESE CRIMES ALIKE--SEE THE IMPORT OF THEM
FURIOUS TROOPS OF PEACEFUL CITIZENS TAKING UP ARMS AT AN EMPTY WORD OF COMMAND FOR SOME RIDICULOUS QUESTION OF FRONTIERS OR COLONIAL TRADE INTERESTS--HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT
THE SOCIETY AND THE JOURNAL DID NOT EXIST FOR LONG
ARE YOU DOING WHAT HE WILLS
BUT THE ASSERTION THAT THE HOLY GHOST THAT IS GOD SPOKE THROUGH THE APOSTLES IN ITS TURN WANTED PROOF
THE ANSWER IS LIKE THAT OF THE WISE MAN WHO WHEN ASKED WHETHER IT WAS FAR TO THE TOWN ANSWERED WALK HOW CAN WE TELL WHETHER IT IS FAR TO THE GOAL WHICH HUMANITY IS APPROACHING WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MEN ARE GOING TOWARD IT WHILE IT DEPENDS ON THEM WHETHER THEY GO OR DO NOT GO STAND STILL SLACKEN THEIR PACE OR HASTEN IT
THE MATTER WAS REFERRED TO PETERSBURG AND THE ORDER WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR TO CARRY THE DECISION OF THE COURT INTO EFFECT
WAR IS HOLY WAR IS ORDAINED OF GOD
WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT THERE ARE NO SUCH PERSONS NOW THAT WE DO NOT NOWADAYS CARRY OR USE FIREARMS BUT EVERYONE PROFESSES HUMANE PRINCIPLES AND FEELS SYMPATHY FOR HIS FELLOWS AND WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN WE ALL DO--THAT IS TO BE LEFT IN PEACE TO ENJOY HIS EXISTENCE UNDISTURBED
THE SOVEREIGNS WHO NOWADAYS TAKE COUNSEL WITH THEIR MINISTERS DECIDE BY THEIR WILL ALONE WHETHER THE BUTCHERY OF MILLIONS IS TO BE BEGUN THIS YEAR OR NEXT
ONE OF THE REJECTED COMES OUT AND ANNOUNCES THAT PIOTR IS TAKEN AND AT ONCE A SHRILL CRY IS HEARD FROM PIOTR'S YOUNG WIFE FOR WHOM THIS WORD TAKEN MEANS SEPARATION FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER'S WIFE AS A SERVANT OFTEN A PROSTITUTE
THEY TOO HAVE THEIR LAWS
AT FIRST THE WATER ONLY RUNS IN SLOWLY ON ONE SIDE BUT AS THE VESSEL GROWS HEAVIER IT SUDDENLY BEGINS TO SINK AND ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY FILLS WITH WATER
TUMULTS MAY ARISE AGAINST US
THE JUDGES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO JUDGE AND CONDEMN CRIMINALS CONDUCT THE PROCEEDINGS SO AS TO WHITEWASH THEM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
THIRDLY EVEN IF IT SHOULD COME TO PASS THAT I HAD TO SUFFER FOR IT EVEN THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO BE EXILED OR SENT TO PRISON FOR STANDING UP FOR COMMON SENSE AND RIGHT--WHICH IF NOT TO-DAY AT LEAST WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME MUST BE TRIUMPHANT--THAN TO SUFFER FOR FOLLY AND WRONG WHICH MUST COME TO AN END DIRECTLY
IF ONE COULD PUT SALT ON A BIRD'S TAIL IT WOULD BE BECAUSE IT COULD NOT FLY AND THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN CATCHING IT
IF I AM LUCKY I SHALL NOT BE SENT TO MURDER MY FELLOW-CREATURES AND SHALL NOT BE EXPOSED TO GREAT DANGER OF BEING MAIMED AND KILLED BUT SHALL ONLY BE ENROLLED INTO MILITARY SLAVERY
AND IF THERE WERE A WAR OTHER NATIONS WOULD NOT LET US GAIN ANY ADVANTAGE FROM IT
ON ALL SIDES OFFICERS WERE BUSTLING NOISILY ABOUT IN THEIR RED UNIFORMS TRIMMED WITH GOLD
IT IS THE CUSTOM AMONG ASSASSINS TO OBLIGE ALL THE WITNESSES OF A MURDER TO STRIKE THE MURDERED VICTIM THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY MAY BE DIVIDED AMONG AS LARGE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE
THEREFORE THEY CANNOT BE AGREEABLE TO THE WILL OF GOD AND THEREFORE THEIR OVERTHROW BY A SPIRITUAL REGENERATION OF THEIR SUBJECTS IS INEVITABLE
BUT THROUGH INERTIA IT CONTINUES TO KEEP UP THE OLD FORMS OF LIFE
THE FOURTH METHOD CONSISTS IN SELECTING FROM ALL THE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN STUPEFIED AND ENSLAVED BY THE THREE FORMER METHODS A CERTAIN NUMBER EXPOSING THEM TO SPECIAL AND INTENSIFIED MEANS OF STUPEFACTION AND BRUTALIZATION AND SO MAKING THEM INTO A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT FOR CARRYING OUT ALL THE CRUELTIES AND BRUTALITIES NEEDED BY THE GOVERNMENT
CHRIST'S TEACHING GUIDES MEN BY POINTING THEM TO THE INFINITE PERFECTION OF THEIR HEAVENLY FATHER TO WHICH EVERY MAN INDEPENDENTLY AND VOLUNTARILY STRUGGLES WHATEVER THE DEGREE OF HIS IMPERFECTION IN THE PRESENT
AND TO SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM WHEN THEIR STRENGTH RESTS ON THE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM
IN REALITY IT IS THOSE WHO HAVE SEIZED POWER AND WHO KEEP IT FOR THEIR OWN AND THEIR RETAINERS BENEFIT
BUT PRECISELY HOW MANY ARE NEEDED TO MAKE IT PERMISSIBLE
GREAT PROPERTIES AND FORTUNES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE AND ORGANIZE WORK FOR THE WORKING CLASSES
INSTEAD OF THAT WE BEGIN BY ESTABLISHING AMONG THEM NEW MARKETS FOR OUR COMMERCE WITH THE SOLE AIM OF OUR OWN PROFIT
IF THE CROWD DOES NOT EVEN THEN DISPERSE THE GOVERNOR GIVES THE ORDER TO FIRE STRAIGHT INTO THE CROWD
INDEED BUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OWN MISDEEDS
FOR THIS WE HAVE A SUCCESSION OF CHRISTIAN PRIESTS TO PRAY FOR US AND BESEECH THE BLESSING OF HEAVEN ON THE HOLY WORK OF SLAUGHTER
ATTITUDE OF MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY TO WAR VII
FOR OUR ARMIES ARE SIMPLY GANGS OF SLAVES AT THE DISPOSAL OF ONE OR TWO COMMANDERS OR MINISTERS WHO EXERCISE A DESPOTIC CONTROL OVER THEM WITHOUT ANY REAL RESPONSIBILITY AS WE VERY WELL KNOW
AH
AH
AH
AH
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF DOING ANYTHING
BUT HOWEVER MUCH WE WORK UPON OURSELVES WE CANNOT BELIEVE IT
THIS PUT SIMPLY IS HOW IT HAS COME TO PASS
ACCORDING TO THE METAPHYSICS OF HYPOCRISY IT IS HELD THAT HE IS DOING A WORK OF PUBLIC UTILITY
THEY WILL MARCH TO BATTLE SO DELUDED SO DUPED THAT THEY WILL BELIEVE SLAUGHTER TO BE A DUTY AND WILL ASK THE BENEDICTION OF GOD ON THEIR LUST FOR BLOOD
AND NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES BUT ALL LITTLE SATRAPS SCATTERED OVER EVERYWHERE LIKE SO MANY GENERAL BARANOVS GOVERNORS POLICE OFFICERS EVEN AND COMMANDERS OF COMPANIES CAN PERPETRATE THE MOST AWFUL CRIMES BEFORE THERE IS TIME FOR THEM TO BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE
HE NO LONGER CARES ABOUT THE FORM OF HIS WORK AND HIS STYLE IS OFTEN SLIPSHOD INVOLVED AND DIFFUSE
SOLDIERS WITH THEIR HANDS RAISED TO THEIR CAPS AND RESPECTFUL MURMURS OF YES YOUR EXCELLENCY HASTEN OBEDIENTLY TO CARRY OUT THIS ORDER
WHAT SHALL WE FIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS OF THE WORLD WE ARE ABANDONING
WHATEVER NAMES WE DIGNIFY OURSELVES WITH WHATEVER UNIFORMS WE WEAR WHATEVER PRIESTS WE ANOINT OURSELVES BEFORE HOWEVER MANY MILLIONS WE POSSESS HOWEVER MANY GUARDS ARE STATIONED ALONG OUR ROAD HOWEVER MANY POLICEMEN GUARD OUR WEALTH HOWEVER MANY SO-CALLED CRIMINALS REVOLUTIONISTS AND ANARCHISTS WE PUNISH WHATEVER EXPLOITS WE HAVE PERFORMED WHATEVER STATES WE MAY HAVE FOUNDED FORTRESSES AND TOWERS WE MAY HAVE ERECTED--FROM BABEL TO THE EIFFEL TOWER--THERE ARE TWO INEVITABLE CONDITIONS OF LIFE CONFRONTING ALL OF US WHICH DESTROY ITS WHOLE MEANING
THE MATTER IN DISPUTE WAS A FALL OF WATER WHICH IRRIGATED THE PEASANTS FIELDS AND WHICH THE LANDOWNER WANTED TO CUT OFF AND DIVERT TO TURN HIS MILL
IT IS JUST AS THOUGH THE BEES WHO WANT TO START AND FLY AWAY SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO LONG A PROCESS TO WAIT FOR ALL THE SWARM TO START ONE BY ONE
THE CONGRESS PLACES ON RECORD A HEARTFELT EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TO ALMIGHTY GOD FOR THE REMARKABLE HARMONY AND CONCORD WHICH HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE MEETINGS OF THE ASSEMBLY IN WHICH SO MANY MEN AND WOMEN OF VARIED NATIONS CREEDS TONGUES AND RACES HAVE GATHERED IN CLOSEST CO-OPERATION AND FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THE LABORS OF THE CONGRESS
VASSILY NIKITIN AND THEY LEAD THE TREMBLING YOUTH AWAY
AND THERE WOULD SEEM THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THESE ALTERNATIVES
WHAT DO THEY DEMAND FROM THE PEOPLE IN VIRTUE OF THEIR SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN FAITH
THEY TOIL NOT NEITHER DO THEY SPIN
THE PRACTICAL REASONABLENESS OF THIS RULE OF CONDUCT IS SHOWN INDEPENDENTLY OF SCRIPTURE AND ALL THE OBJECTIONS ORDINARILY MADE AGAINST ITS PRACTICABILITY ARE STATED AND REFUTED
THIS METHOD IS IN USE NOW--AS IT HAS BEEN FROM OLDEN TIMES--WHEREVER THERE IS A GOVERNMENT
BETTER IS THIS THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING DESTROYED BY VICTORIOUS ENEMIES AND BEING STUPIDLY TORTURED AND KILLED BY THEM IN FIGHTING FOR A CANNON OR A PIECE OF LAND OF NO USE TO ANYONE OR FOR A SENSELESS RAG CALLED A BANNER
WE LIVE IN A TIME WHICH IS FULL OF INCONSISTENCIES WRITES COUNT KOMAROVSKY THE PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN HIS LEARNED TREATISE
OR MAKING A POOR MAN PAY DOUBLE THE VALUE FOR ANYTHING SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS IN THE DIREST POVERTY;--NOT A MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY CAN FAIL TO KNOW THAT ALL THESE ACTIONS ARE BASE AND DISGRACEFUL AND THAT THEY NEED NOT DO THEM
AND FURTHER WE OUGHT TO WORK WITH ALL THE POWERS GIVEN US TO BRING THAT HOUR TO PASS AS THE SERVANTS OUGHT TO WORK WITH THE TALENTS INTRUSTED TO THEM
THIS RESTRICTION IS MADE NOWHERE IN OUR SAVIOUR'S LIFE OR PREACHING
IN THESE WORKS WHICH ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE CLEARNESS OF THEIR THOUGHT AND ELOQUENCE OF EXPOSITION THE QUESTION IS LOOKED AT FROM EVERY POSSIBLE SIDE AND THE BINDING NATURE OF THIS COMMAND ON EVERY CHRISTIAN WHO ACKNOWLEDGES THE BIBLE AS THE REVELATION OF GOD IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
IN THE LAST PLOTS AGAINST THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT MANY OF THE CONSPIRATORS WERE IN THE ARMY
I DON'T MEAN NOW CHRISTIANS MINISTERS OF RELIGION PHILANTHROPISTS AND MORALISTS BUT SIMPLY PEOPLE WHO VALUE THEIR LIFE THEIR SECURITY AND THEIR COMFORT
F
LIKE EVERY ADVOCATE OF THE LOVE OF HUMANITY CHRIST WENT TO THE FURTHEST EXTREME IN HIS TEACHING
AND YOU WILL AT ONCE LOSE THE POSITION WHICH YOU PRETEND IS FORCED UPON YOU AND WHICH SEEMS BURDENSOME TO YOU
BUT IN ALL TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN MEN IN WHOM THIS FACULTY WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG AND THESE MEN HAVE GIVEN CLEAR AND DEFINITE EXPRESSION TO WHAT ALL MEN FELT VAGUELY AND FORMED A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE FROM WHICH NEW LINES OF ACTION FOLLOWED FOR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS
BUT CHRISTIAN LOVE ONLY IN ITS RESULTS NOT IN ITS FOUNDATIONS
BUT THE MISERABLE GOVERNOR NOW COMPLETELY INTOXICATED BY THE SIGHT OF BLOOD GAVE ORDERS THAT THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD GO ON AND THE FLOGGING WAS CONTINUED UP TO SEVENTY STROKES THE NUMBER WHICH THE GOVERNOR HAD FOR SOME REASON FIXED UPON AS NECESSARY
A MAN CANNOT BUT SUFFER WHEN HIS WHOLE LIFE IS DEFINED BEFOREHAND FOR HIM BY LAWS WHICH HE MUST OBEY UNDER THREAT OF PUNISHMENT THOUGH HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THEIR WISDOM OR JUSTICE AND OFTEN CLEARLY PERCEIVES THEIR INJUSTICE CRUELTY AND ARTIFICIALITY
AND THE CHURCHES DO WITH EVER-INCREASING INTENSITY AND ZEAL MAKE SUCH EFFORTS
WHAT IS CONSIDERED AS BAD IS NOTHING BUT THE ANTICHRISTIAN VICES
THAT IS JUST WHAT SOLDIERS OFFICERS AND GENERALS ARE GOING TO MURDER AND BE MURDERED AT THE WILL OF A RULER OR RULERS
I AM DEAR SIR ETC JULES CLARETIE THE UPSHOT OF THIS LETTER IS THAT THERE IS NO HARM IN TALKING ABOUT WHAT NO ONE INTENDS OR FEELS OBLIGED TO DO
THE MOST DIFFICULT SUBJECTS CAN BE EXPLAINED TO THE MOST SLOW-WITTED MAN IF HE HAS NOT FORMED ANY IDEA OF THEM ALREADY
WHO IS TO COMPEL PEOPLE TO DO THIS AND THAT
HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL PEACE CAN ONLY BE FOUNDED ON THE OPEN PROFESSION OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY VIOLENCE MATT
IT IS MUCH AS IF MEN WERE TO MAINTAIN THAT TO MAKE UP A FIRE THERE WAS NO NEED TO KINDLE ANY OF THE COALS BUT THAT ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY WAS TO ARRANGE THE COALS IN A CERTAIN ORDER
WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE MEN ARE EITHER CHRISTIANS OR PROFESS HUMANE AND LIBERAL PRINCIPLES AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY THUS BECOME PARTLY RESPONSIBLE--THROUGH UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE--FOR THE MOST INSANE AIMLESS AND BRUTAL MURDERS
AND CAN A CHRISTIAN THEN OR CAN HE NOT ALWAYS REMAINING A CHRISTIAN GO TO LAW OR MAKE ANY USE OF THE LAW OR SEEK HIS OWN PROTECTION IN THE LAW
AND HE SEES TOO THAT THE MEN WHO MAKE UP THE ARMIES COULD TURN THEIR ARMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENTS AND BRING THEM TO JUDGMENT
THE SERVANTS OF THE CHURCHES OF ALL DENOMINATIONS ESPECIALLY OF LATER TIMES TRY TO SHOW THEMSELVES CHAMPIONS OF PROGRESS IN CHRISTIANITY
IF I SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER FROM THE CHANGE I SHOULD BE CONSOLED BY THINKING THAT THE EXECUTIONERS OF THAT DAY WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE PREVIOUS TIME AND THE HOPE OF SOMETHING BETTER WOULD HELP US TO ENDURE THE WORST
SUR L'EAU PP
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING THE SON OF GOD WHOSE CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC IS LOVE SATISFIES THE NEED FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE SPHERE OF LOVE TO WHICH THE MAN OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAD BEEN BROUGHT
I--BY CHRIST'S LAW--AS A CHRISTIAN--I CANNOT WHAT IS HE MUTTERING ASKS THE PRESIDENT FROWNING IMPATIENTLY AND RAISING HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK TO LISTEN
HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT SUPERINTEND AND GIVE ORDERS AND GIVE ORDERS AND SUPERINTEND THOUGH HIS SUPERINTENDENCE AND HIS ORDERS SERVED NO USEFUL PURPOSE WHATEVER
THE POLICEMAN A YOUNG FELLOW WITH A RESOLUTE FLOURISH OF HIS RIGHT ARM AND A CLINK OF HIS SABER CAME UP TO US AND COMMANDED US SEVERELY
IT IS ONLY SAID
OR TO PROFIT BY THE POVERTY OF MEN TO INCREASE ONE'S GAINS AS MERCHANTS DO
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT NOT ONE OF THESE METHODS ATTAINS THE AIM EITHER OF INTRUSTING POWER ONLY TO THE INCORRUPTIBLE OR OF PREVENTING POWER FROM BEING ABUSED
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CUSTOM IN CHINA
THE REVOLUTIONISTS TOO BECAUSE THIS PRINCIPLE WOULD HINDER THEIR RESISTANCE TO EVIL AS APPLIED TO THE CONSERVATIVES AND THE OVERTHROWING OF THEM
SOME BELIEVERS IN THE SUPERNATURAL CHARACTER OF CHRISTIANITY HOLD THAT SALVATION WILL COME WHEN ALL MEN ARE BROUGHT TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST WHOSE SECOND COMING IS AT HAND
THIS DECLARATION OF GARRISON'S GAVE SO POWERFUL AND ELOQUENT AN EXPRESSION OF A CONFESSION OF FAITH OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO MEN THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE PRODUCED A STRONG IMPRESSION ON PEOPLE AND HAVE BECOME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION ON EVERY SIDE
ALL YOUNG MEN OF TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE ARE OBLIGED TO DRAW LOTS FOR SERVICE IN THE ARMY
THE CHURCH WAS FOUNDED BY CHRIST
IN SPITE OF THEIR SUPERSTITIOUS REGARD FOR IKONS HOUSESPIRITS RELICS AND FESTIVALS WITH WREATHS OF BIRCH LEAVES THERE HAS STILL ALWAYS BEEN IN THE PEOPLE A PROFOUND MORAL AND LIVING UNDERSTANDING OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH THERE HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE CHURCH AS A WHOLE AND WHICH IS ONLY MET WITH IN ITS BEST REPRESENTATIVES
NEXT
THE ESSENCE OF EVERY RELIGIOUS TEACHING LIES NOT IN THE DESIRE FOR A SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION OF THE FORCES OF NATURE NOR IN THE DREAD OF THESE FORCES NOR IN THE CRAVING FOR THE MARVELOUS NOR IN THE EXTERNAL FORMS IN WHICH IT IS MANIFESTED AS MEN OF SCIENCE IMAGINE
THAT YOU CONTINUE TO BE A SOLDIER NOT FROM FEAR OF PUNISHMENT BUT BECAUSE YOU CONSIDER THE ARMY NECESSARY TO SOCIETY
AND THEY DO NOT RELAX IT IN SPITE OF ALL THEIR PRETENDED CARE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE WORKING CLASSES FOR THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY FOR REGULATION OF THE LABOR OF MINORS AND OF WOMEN FOR SAVINGS BANKS AND PENSIONS
THE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN AN AMERICAN JOURNAL THE FORUM IN OCTOBER 1888
WHEN A CAPTAIN HAS LET HIS SHIP COME TO RUIN HE IS JUDGED AND CONDEMNED IF HE IS FOUND GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE OR EVEN INCAPACITY
PEOPLE DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN LIFE AND CONSCIENCE BY A CHANGE OF LIFE BUT THEIR CULTIVATED LEADERS EXERT EVERY EFFORT TO OBSCURE THE DEMANDS OF CONSCIENCE AND JUSTIFY THEIR LIFE
JOHN VIII
HELCHITSKY GAVE THE TITLE THE NET OF FAITH TO HIS BOOK TAKING AS HIS MOTTO THE VERSE OF THE GOSPEL ABOUT THE CALLING OF THE DISCIPLES TO BE FISHERS OF MEN
WE OURSELVES WISH TO SUPPRESS THESE FORMS OF PUNISHMENT AND ARE WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION HYPOCRISY IN OUR DAY IS SUPPORTED ON TWO SIDES
BUT THEY TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE SAME CONCEPTION OF IT HAS GONE ON EXISTING UP TO NOW
TRUE THOUGH IT MAY BE THAT THERE WERE SINS AND ERRORS AMONG THE SO-CALLED HERETICS IT IS NO LESS TRUE AND EVIDENT HE SAYS FARTHER ON FROM THE INNUMERABLE EXAMPLES QUOTED HERE I
THAT IS AN ERROR
AND IF HEAVENLY THINGS AND THOUGHTS PRESENT THEMSELVES TO A MAN'S MIND AS SO GREAT AND SO PROFOUND THAT HE DOES NOT FIND CORRESPONDING WORDS TO EXPRESS THEM OUGHT ONE TO CALL HIM A HERETIC BECAUSE HE CANNOT EXPRESS HIS IDEA WITH PERFECT EXACTNESS AND IN QUESTION 33
AND WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU ARE DOING THIS
ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S TEACHING IT CONSISTS IN AN EVER CLOSER APPROXIMATION TO THE DIVINE PERFECTION HELD UP BEFORE EVERY MAN AND RECOGNIZED WITHIN HIMSELF BY EVERY MAN IN AN EVER CLOSER AND CLOSER APPROACH TO THE PERFECT FUSION OF HIS WILL IN THE WILL OF GOD THAT FUSION TOWARD WHICH MAN STRIVES AND THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH WOULD BE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LIFE ME KNOW
BUT LIFE SHALL GO FOR LIFE EYE FOR EYE TOOTH FOR TOOTH HAND FOR HAND FOOT FOR FOOT."--DEUT
THE PROPOSITION THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS WE WOULD NOT THEY SHOULD DO UNTO US DID NOT NEED TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES AND NEEDED NO EXERCISE OF FAITH BECAUSE THIS PROPOSITION IS IN ITSELF CONVINCING AND IN HARMONY WITH MAN'S MIND AND NATURE
WHAT WAS PERMITTED IS FORBIDDEN
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM FAR FROM ANYONE USING VIOLENCE AGAINST THE IMMENSE MASSES WHO ARE NOW ILL-TREATED THOSE WHO NOW COMMAND THEIR PUNISHMENT WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SENTENCE THEM WOULD NOT EVEN DARE TO DREAM OF THE SENTENCES THEY DECREE WITH SUCH EASY CONFIDENCE AT PRESENT
TO DESTROY ANOTHER LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE IS AS THOUGH A MAN TO REPAIR THE MISFORTUNE OF LOSING ONE ARM SHOULD CUT OFF THE OTHER ARM FOR THE SAKE OF EQUITY
I--I AS A CHRISTIAN AND AT LAST IT APPEARS THAT THE YOUNG MAN REFUSES TO SERVE IN THE ARMY BECAUSE HE IS A CHRISTIAN
THEY USUALLY SAY THAT THE MORAL TEACHING OF CHRISTIANITY IS VERY FINE BUT OVEREXAGGERATED
39 IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE QUAKERS WITH WHOM GARRISON HAPPENED TO BE ON FRIENDLY RELATIONS
THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE MEN OF OUR MODERN WORLD WHO FILL OFFICES BASED UPON VIOLENCE WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF THE EMPEROR IN ANDERSEN'S TALE OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES WHEN THE CHILD SEEING THE EMPEROR UNDRESSED CRIED IN ALL SIMPLICITY LOOK HE IS NAKED AND THEN ALL THE REST WHO HAD SEEN HIM AND SAID NOTHING COULD NOT HELP RECOGNIZING IT TOO
NOT TO SPEAK OF THE DUTIES AND OCCUPATIONS NOW OPENLY DESPISED SUCH AS THAT OF SPY AGENT OF SECRET POLICE MONEYLENDER AND PUBLICAN THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF PROFESSIONS FORMERLY REGARDED AS HONORABLE SUCH AS THOSE OF POLICE OFFICIALS COURTIERS JUDGES AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONARIES CLERGYMEN MILITARY OFFICERS SPECULATORS AND BANKERS WHICH ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED DESIRABLE POSITIONS BY EVERYONE AND ARE EVEN DESPISED BY A SPECIAL CIRCLE OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE
THIS TESTING THE SUBJECT BY THE FANCIED INFALLIBLE METHOD OF SCIENCE IS THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO UNDERSTANDING THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION FOR UNBELIEVERS FOR SO-CALLED EDUCATED PEOPLE
WHAT DO THEY DILIGENTLY ASSIDUOUSLY EVERYWHERE ALIKE WITHOUT INTERMISSION TEACH THE PEOPLE
THEN IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE CHILD AS IT GROWS UP MUST BE TAUGHT TO PRAY
THEN THE JUDGES SHALL MAKE DILIGENT INQUISITION
STAND TO BE MEASURED
IF I UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES I SAY THAT MEN ARE ONLY PLAYING WITH CHRISTIANITY SO LONG AS THEY IGNORE THE QUESTION OF WAR
CETTE PRESOMPTION NE SE TRANSFORMERAIT-ELLE PAS EN CERTITUDE SI NOUS RECONNAISSONS DANS LA DOCTRINE UNIVERSELLEMENT REPOUSSEE PAR L'EGLISE LES TRAITS CARACTERISTIQUES DE L'UNE DES RELIGIONS DU PASSE
THE LUNATICS AGREED AND A SMALL BAND FOLLOWED THE DOCTOR
THE PRACTICAL BUSINESS OF THE CHURCH CONSISTS IN INSTILLING BY EVERY CONCEIVABLE MEANS INTO THE MASS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THOSE EXTINCT RELICS OF BELIEFS FOR WHICH THERE IS NOWADAYS NO KIND OF JUSTIFICATION IN WHICH SCARCELY ANYONE NOW BELIEVES AND OFTEN NOT EVEN THOSE WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO DIFFUSE THESE FALSE BELIEFS TO INSTILL INTO THE PEOPLE THE FORMULAS OF BYZANTINE THEOLOGY OF THE TRINITY OF THE MOTHER OF GOD OF SACRAMENTS OF GRACE AND SO ON EXTINCT CONCEPTIONS FOREIGN TO US AND HAVING NO KIND OF MEANING FOR MEN OF OUR TIMES FORMS ONLY ONE PART OF THE WORK OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH
LET EACH OF US ONLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE CHRISTIAN TRUTH WHICH IN THE MOST VARIED FORMS SURROUNDS US ON ALL SIDES AND FORCES ITSELF UPON US
DIRECTLY SIDOROV COMES IN A GUARD GOES UP TO HIM PLACES HIM UNDER THE MEASURING FRAME RAISING HIM UNDER HIS CHIN AND STRAIGHTENING HIS LEGS
WHETHER MEN WORSHIPED OR DID NOT WORSHIP THE GODS OR THE IMAGES OR THE POPE THE STATE REMAINED JUST AS POWERFUL
HE PERSISTS IN NOT TAKING THE OATH AND OPENLY REFUSES TO PERFORM ANY MILITARY DUTIES
HOW ABOUT ME--OUGHT I TO TAKE ANY PART IN IT IN THEIR VIEW NO QUESTION OF THIS KIND EVEN EXISTS AND EVERY MAN HOWEVER HE MAY REGARD WAR FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT MUST SLAVISHLY SUBMIT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AUTHORITIES ON THE SUBJECT
THIS ANTAGONISM IS APPARENT IN ECONOMIC AS WELL AS POLITICAL LIFE
THAT AS EMPEROR OR PRESIDENT YOU ARE TO COMMAND ARMIES THAT IS TO BE THE HEAD AND COMMANDER OF MURDERERS
THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITION OF EVIL AND RESISTANCE TO IT BY FORCE EVIDENT AS IT WAS IN THE EARLY AGES OF CHRISTIANITY BECOMES STILL MORE OBVIOUS THROUGH THE DIVISION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE INTO MANY STATES OF EQUAL AUTHORITY THROUGH THEIR HOSTILITIES AND THE INTERNAL CONFLICTS THAT BROKE OUT WITHIN THEM
HERESY IS THE OPINION OF THE MEN WHO DO NOT ADMIT THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE CHURCH'S TRUTH
IF I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM PERSONALLY I KNOW THEIR CHARACTERS PRETTY NEARLY THEIR PAST AND THEIR WAY OF THINKING
MEN HAVE OUTLIVED THE SOCIAL FAMILY AND STATE CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE
THAT THIS GOD CAME DOWN UPON EARTH TO ATONE FOR ADAM'S SIN
ACCORDING TO THIS FAITH IKONS AND RELICS COMMUNICATE A SPECIAL SANCTITY POWER AND GRACE AND EVEN PROXIMITY TO THESE OBJECTS TOUCHING THEM KISSING THEM PUTTING CANDLES BEFORE THEM CRAWLING UNDER THEM WHILE THEY ARE BEING CARRIED ALONG ARE ALL EFFICACIOUS FOR SALVATION AS WELL AS TE DEUMS REPEATED BEFORE THESE HOLY THINGS
THEREFORE TAKE NO THOUGHT SAYING WHAT SHALL WE EAT
THEY MAKE CONCESSIONS WISH TO CORRECT THE ABUSES THAT HAVE SLIPPED INTO THE CHURCH AND MAINTAIN THAT ONE CANNOT ON ACCOUNT OF THESE ABUSES DENY THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH ALONE CAN BIND ALL MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY AND BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN MEN AND GOD
BUT MAN IS A CREATURE WITH A CONSCIENCE AND CAPABLE OF ATTAINING A HIGHER AND HIGHER DEGREE OF TRUTH
DECEPTION STUPEFACTION BLOWS AND VODKA
THE LATTER DEMAND WAS AT FIRST NOT UNDERSTOOD
TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE HE LOSES IT
THEY REFUSE TO TAKE ANY PART IN MILITARY PREPARATIONS AND IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE EXECUTIONERS AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO BE SO
THEN IT IS INSTILLED INTO THE PARENTS THAT THEY OUGHT TO ADMINISTER THE SACRAMENT TO THE CHILD THAT IS GIVE HIM IN THE GUISE OF BREAD AND WINE A PORTION OF CHRIST'S BODY TO EAT AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE CHILD RECEIVES THE GRACE OF GOD WITHIN IT AND SO ON
THE PEASANTS LODGED A COMPLAINT
INFIDELS HERETICS AND SCHISMATICS THE SO-CALLED GREEK ORTHODOX ARE REGARDED AS SCHISMATICS THE LUTHERANS AS HERETICS
AND A CHRISTIANITY TOO THEY HAVE ELABORATED WHICH DOES NOT DESTROY BUT SUPPORTS GOVERNMENTS
AS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING THEY ARE LEFT ALONE
PRODUCED BY JACK EDEN <JACKEDEN@YAHOO.COM> FOR THOSE INTERESTED THERE IS A NOTE AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT THAT DETAILS THE ADAPTATIONS MADE TO THIS WORK TO FIT IT INTO PLAIN ASCII TEXT THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU CHRISTIANITY NOT AS A MYSTIC RELIGION BUT AS A NEW THEORY OF LIFE TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN OF COUNT LEO TOLSTOI BY CONSTANCE GARNETT NEW YORK 1894 TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE
THEY FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THEIR LAW IT WAS GENERALLY OF A RELIGIOUS CHARACTER WAS THE ONLY JUST LAW WHICH EVERYONE OUGHT TO OBEY
AND AS THE MAN WHO IS DREAMING DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT APPEARS TO HIM CAN BE TRULY THE REALITY AND TRIES TO WAKE UP TO THE ACTUAL REAL WORLD AGAIN SO THE AVERAGE MAN OF MODERN DAYS CANNOT IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART BELIEVE THAT THE AWFUL POSITION IN WHICH HE IS PLACED AND WHICH IS GROWING WORSE AND WORSE CAN BE THE REALITY AND TRIES TO WAKE UP TO A TRUE REAL LIFE AS IT EXISTS IN HIS CONSCIENCE
THE IDEAL THAT HAS POWER OVER MEN IS NOT AN IDEAL INVENTED BY SOMEONE BUT THE IDEAL THAT EVERY MAN CARRIES WITHIN HIS SOUL
OUGHT THE WORD NON-RESISTANCE TO BE TAKEN IN ITS WIDEST SENSE--THAT IS TO SAY AS INTENDING THAT WE SHOULD NOT OFFER ANY RESISTANCE OF ANY KIND TO EVIL

AND THEREFORE IN THE FIRST PLACE RELIGION IS NOT AS SCIENCE IMAGINES A MANIFESTATION WHICH AT ONE TIME CORRESPONDED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY BUT IS AFTERWARD OUTGROWN BY IT
CANNOT THEY SEE THAT THIS ORDER OF THINGS IS ESSENTIALLY IRRATIONAL THAT IT IS NO LONGER CONSISTENT WITH THE STAGE OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY PEOPLE AND WITH PUBLIC OPINION AND THAT IT IS FRAUGHT WITH PERILS
THE ERROR ARISES FROM THE LEARNED JURISTS DECEIVING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS BY ASSERTING THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT WHAT IT REALLY IS ONE SET OF MEN BANDED TOGETHER TO OPPRESS ANOTHER SET OF MEN BUT AS SHOWN BY SCIENCE IS THE REPRESENTATION OF THE CITIZENS IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TEACHING IS THE INSTITUTION OF A NEW THEORY OF LIFE CORRESPONDING TO THE NEW CONDITIONS ON WHICH MEN HAVE ENTERED NOW FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AND ALSO THE DEFINITION OF THE NEW CONDUCT OF LIFE WHICH RESULTS FROM IT
SO THAT ONE CANNOT EXPECT FROM THEM FREE DISCUSSION OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE QUESTION--THAT IS OF THE CHANGE IN MEN'S LIFE WHICH MUST RESULT FROM APPLYING CHRIST'S TEACHING TO THE EXISTING ORDER OF THE WORLD
THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN THE INSPIRATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE SACRED CHARACTER OF DAVID WHO COMMANDED ON HIS DEATHBED THE MURDER OF AN OLD MAN WHO HAD CURSED HIM AND WHOM HE COULD NOT KILL HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS BOUND BY AN OATH TO HIM AND THE SIMILAR ATROCITIES OF WHICH THE OLD TESTAMENT IS FULL CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE HOLY LOVE OF CHRIST
AND THE CHIEF OFFICERS CONSEQUENTLY DO NOT DECIDE TO PUNISH THIS REFUSAL OF OBEDIENCE WITH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES
ONLY THIS IDEAL OF COMPLETE INFINITE PERFECTION HAS POWER OVER MEN AND STIMULATES THEM TO ACTION
CHRIST IN NO DISPARAGING SENSE BE IT SAID HAD THE TYPICAL TEMPERAMENT OF SUCH A REFORMER
INCREASE OF LIFE ACCORDING TO THIS CONSISTS IN NOTHING BUT THE QUICKENING OF THE PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION
THEN WE APPROPRIATE THEIR LANDS I
OR THAT AS JUDGE OR JURYMAN YOU COULD BE FORCED TO SENTENCE ERRING MEN TO ILL TREATMENT AND DEATH BECAUSE THE TRUTH WAS NOT REVEALED TO THEM OR ABOVE ALL FOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF ALL THE EVIL THAT YOU COULD BE FORCED TO BECOME A SOLDIER AND RENOUNCING YOUR FREE WILL AND YOUR HUMAN SENTIMENTS COULD UNDERTAKE TO KILL ANYONE AT THE COMMAND OF OTHER MEN
DE PRESSENSE IN HIS HISTOIRE DU DOGME PARIS 1869 UNDER THE HEADING UBI CHRISTUS IBI ECCLESIA MAY SERVE AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING LIKE A DEFINITION OF WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD HERESY
THE NAME GIVEN BY A BODY OF MEN TO ANY OPINION WHICH REJECTS A PART OF THE CREED PROFESSED BY THAT BODY
IT IS A MANIFESTATION ALWAYS INHERENT IN THE LIFE OF HUMANITY AND IS AS INDISPENSABLE AS INHERENT IN HUMANITY AT THE PRESENT TIME AS AT ANY OTHER
AND IN SPITE OF THIS I CONTINUE TO ELECT OR BE ELECTED I PROPOSE TO VOTE I AM EVEN READY TO BE APPOINTED TO ANY OFFICE UNDER GOVERNMENT
NO LONGER A FEW THOUSANDS OF POOR DEVILS WHO WERE PAID A PRICE FOR THEIR BLOOD ARE KEPT UNDER ARMS BUT WHOLE NATIONS ARE UNDER ARMS TO CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS
THERE MAY BE A SEMBLANCE OF MATHEMATICS ADMITTING THAT TWO IS EQUAL TO THREE BUT THERE CAN BE NO REAL SCIENCE OF MATHEMATICS
HAD NOT A FEW PERSONS HAD A CLEAR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS WRONG AND CONSEQUENTLY INFLUENCED ONE ANOTHER IN THAT DIRECTION WHAT WAS DONE AT OREL WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT TOULA
THE PRACTICE OF OUR RUSSIAN SO-CALLED ORTHODOX CHURCH IS PLAIN TO ALL
NATURAL SCIENCE HAS RATIFIED IN OUR DAY THE MYSTERIOUS LAW REVEALED TO JOSEPH DE MAISTRE BY THE INTUITION OF HIS GENIUS AND BY MEDITATION ON FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS
AFTER THIS WE SEND SOME DOZENS OF MISSIONARIES PRATING TO THEM OF THE HYPOCRITICAL ABSURDITIES OF THE CHURCH AND THEN QUOTE THE FAILURE OF OUR EFFORTS TO TURN THE HEATHEN TO CHRISTIANITY AS AN INCONTROVERTIBLE PROOF OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF APPLYING THE TRUTHS OF CHRISTIANITY IN PRACTICAL LIFE
BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHEREAS FORMERLY MEN COULD ACCEPT OR REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY CHRIST NOW THAT SOLUTION CANNOT BE AVOIDED SINCE IT ALONE CAN SAVE MEN FROM THE SLAVERY IN WHICH THEY ARE CAUGHT LIKE A NET
WHAT IS THEIR INFLUENCE UPON MEN
AS MILLIONS OF MEN HAVE PERISHED SLAYERS AND SLAIN EXECUTING AND EXECUTED TORTURERS AND TORTURED ALIKE AND AS THE MAN FOOLISHLY PERISHED WHO FILLED HIS GRANARIES FULL AND MADE READY FOR A LONG LIFE AND DIED THE VERY NIGHT THAT HE PLANNED TO BEGIN HIS LIFE
IN THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM IT IS SAID
SUCH IS THE ATTITUDE OF CERTAIN LEARNED MEN TO THE CONTRADICTION UNDER WHICH OUR SOCIETY IS BEING CRUSHED AND SUCH ARE THEIR METHODS OF SOLVING IT
THIS BALLAST WHICH STRIKES ONE AT FIRST AS SUPERFLUOUS AND EVEN AS HINDERING THE PROGRESS OF THE VESSEL IS REALLY INDISPENSABLE TO ITS GOOD NAVIGATION
AND THESE VERY MEN WHOM WE HAVE CORRUPTED AND BRUTALIZED BY EVERY MEANS WE BRING FORWARD AS A PROOF THAT ONE CANNOT DEAL WITH CRIMINALS EXCEPT BY BRUTE FORCE
ONE NEED ONLY TALK TO ANY OF THESE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE AFFAIR FROM THE LANDOWNER TO THE LOWEST POLICEMAN OR SOLDIER TO SEE THAT IN THE DEPTH OF THEIR SOUL THEY ALL KNOW IT IS A WICKED THING THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND ARE SUFFERING FROM THE KNOWLEDGE
ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE ALL MODIFICATIONS IN HUMAN LIFE ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY PRECISELY THE SAME LAWS AS IN THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD AND I DON'T WANT TO OVERTURN IT PRECISELY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD BUT FOR THE VERY SAME REASON I DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT IT EITHER
BUT IT WILL BE REPLIED THERE MAY BE SUCH A BALANCE OF POWER SUCH A PONDERATION DE FORCES AS WOULD LEAD STATES TO HOLD BACK OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
DO NOT MAKE IT SUBJECT TO ANYTHING--NEITHER YOU AN ANIMAL SELF NOR THAT OF OTHERS--AND YOU WILL ATTAIN THE VERY AIM TO WHICH YOU ARE STRIVING WHEN YOU SUBJECT YOUR EXTERNAL SELF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE BRINGS A MAN TO THE ELEMENTARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF ONLY NOT OF THE ANIMAL SELF BUT OF THE DIVINE SELF THE DIVINE SPARK THE SELF AS THE SON OF GOD AS MUCH GOD AS THE FATHER HIMSELF THOUGH CONFINED IN AN ANIMAL HUSK
THEY PROPOSE LOVE FOR HUMANITY ALONE APART FROM LOVE FOR GOD
ORDINARILY WHEN SPEAKING OF THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE EXISTING CHURCHES USE THE WORD CHURCH IN THE SINGULAR AS THOUGH THERE WERE AND HAD BEEN ONLY ONE CHURCH
INWARDLY THEY WERE NOT ONLY IN A STATE OF SUFFERING BUT EVEN OF SUSPENSE
THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS NOT A LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH BEING IMPOSED BY VIOLENCE MAY TRANSFORM MEN'S LIVES
IT IS SOMETHING LIKE THE PROCESS OF EBULLITION
IF SOLDIERS THRONGING FROM ABROAD WITH INTENT TO COMMIT RAPINE AND DESTROY LIFE MAY NOT BE RESISTED BY THE PEOPLE OR THE MAGISTRACY THEN OUGHT NO RESISTANCE TO BE OFFERED TO DOMESTIC TROUBLERS OF THE PUBLIC PEACE OR OF PRIVATE SECURITY
THIS CONSIDERATION TOGETHER WITH THE TERRIBLE ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION INVENTED BY MODERN SCIENCE RETARDS THE MOMENT OF DECLARING WAR AND MAINTAINS THE PRESENT TEMPORARY SITUATION WHICH MIGHT CONTINUE FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD EXCEPT FOR THE FEARFUL COST OF MAINTAINING ARMAMENTS WHICH ARE EXHAUSTING THE EUROPEAN STATES AND THREATENING TO REDUCE NATIONS TO A STATE OF MISERY HARDLY LESS THAN THAT OF WAR ITSELF
ONE YEAR TEN TWENTY YEARS PASS BY
NOW THERE IS SOMETHING MORE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENCOURAGE--PEACE
TRUE NON-RESISTANCE IS THE ONLY REAL RESISTANCE TO EVIL
AND THEREFORE THE CHURCHES WILL NOT FOR AN INSTANT RELAX THEIR ZEAL IN THE BUSINESS OF HYPNOTIZING GROWN-UP PEOPLE AND DECEIVING CHILDREN
A CROWD OF ONE THOUSAND OR MORE PEOPLE WERE STANDING ROUND
THEY HAD AT LEAST AN EXTERNAL RELIGIOUS LAW THE FULFILLMENT OF WHICH HINDERED THEM FROM SEEING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR NEIGHBORS
FARRAR ONLY EXPRESSES HIS BELIEF THAT ALTHOUGH ACTUATED BY THE NOBLEST SINCERITY COUNT TOLSTOY HAS BEEN MISLED BY PARTIAL AND ONE-SIDED INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MEANING OF THE GOSPEL AND THE MIND AND WILL OF CHRIST WHAT THIS ERROR CONSISTS IN IS NOT MADE CLEAR
TWO POLICE CONSTABLES HASTENED TO HOLD HIM DOWN
TRANSCRIBISTS NOTE
TO WHATEVER DEGREE OF UNDERSTANDING AND PERFECTION THE FOLLOWER OF CHRIST MAY HAVE ATTAINED HE ALWAYS FEELS THE INSUFFICIENCY OF HIS UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT OF IT AND IS ALWAYS STRIVING TOWARD A FULLER UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT
FOR WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN MONARCHIES AND REPUBLICS
BUT EVEN BEFORE THOSE WHO SUPPORT THESE INSTITUTIONS DECIDE TO ABOLISH THEM THE MEN WHO OCCUPY THESE POSITIONS WILL BE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF THROWING THEM UP
THE PREACHERS OF THE CHURCH NEVER IN ANY OTHER CASE ADVOCATE THE BREAKING OF ANY OTHER COMMANDMENT
GOD IS A SPIRIT AND THEY THAT WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH
CIVILIZATION ART SCIENCE CULTURE WILL DISAPPEAR YES BUT ALL THESE WE KNOW ARE ONLY VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF TRUTH AND THE CHANGE THAT IS BEFORE US IS ONLY TO BE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF A CLOSER ATTAINMENT AND REALIZATION OF TRUTH
NEITHER THE INCREASED NOR THE DIMINISHED SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT NOR THE MODIFICATIONS OF PRISONS NOR THE INCREASE OF POLICE WILL INCREASE OR DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF CRIMINALS
IF WE FEEL NO ASTONISHMENT AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR CONVICTIONS AND OUR CONDUCT THAT IS BECAUSE THE INFLUENCES TENDING TO OBSCURE THE CONTRAST PRODUCE AN EFFECT UPON US TOO
BUT IN THE RECENT CASES OF REFUSAL ON THE PART OF MENNONITES TO SERVE IN THE ARMY ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE ACTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
YOU NEED NOT DECLARE THAT YOU ARE REMAINING A LANDOWNER MANUFACTURER MERCHANT ARTIST OR WRITER BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL TO MANKIND
SINCE THEY SAY IT WAS FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO EXTEND HIS PERSONAL INTEREST TO THE FAMILY THE TRIBE AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE NATION AND THE STATE IT WOULD BE STILL MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO EXTEND HIS INTEREST IN SOCIETIES OF MEN TO THE WHOLE OF MANKIND AND SO ALL TO LIVE FOR HUMANITY JUST AS MEN LIVE FOR THE FAMILY OR THE STATE THEORETICALLY IT FOLLOWS INDEED HAVING EXTENDED THE LOVE AND INTEREST FOR THE PERSONALITY TO THE FAMILY THE TRIBE AND THENCE TO THE NATION AND THE STATE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY LOGICAL FOR MEN TO SAVE THEMSELVES THE STRIFE AND CALAMITIES WHICH RESULT FROM THE DIVISION OF MANKIND INTO NATIONS AND STATES BY EXTENDING THEIR LOVE TO THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY
WE WANT ALL TO BE AS RICH AS THE RICH
TO HEAR OR READ THESE SKILLFUL ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ELABORATED DURING CENTURIES AND EXHORTATIONS AND PROFESSIONS WHICH SOMETIMES SEEM LIKE SINCERE PROFESSIONS ONE IS READY TO DOUBT WHETHER THE CHURCHES CAN BE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY
BUT ONE MAY CONFIDENTLY ASSERT THAT IN ANY SOCIETY WHERE FOR EVERY MAN LIVING IN EASE THERE ARE TEN EXHAUSTED BY LABOR ENVIOUS COVETOUS AND OFTEN SUFFERING WITH THEIR FAMILIES FROM DIRECT PRIVATION ALL THE PRIVILEGES OF THE RICH ALL THEIR LUXURIES AND SUPERFLUITIES ARE OBTAINED AND MAINTAINED ONLY BY TORTURES IMPRISONMENT AND MURDER
IN THEM IT IS STATED THAT VIOLENCE THAT IS IMPRISONMENT AND EXECUTION AS WELL AS MURDER IN CIVIL OR FOREIGN WAR IN THE DEFENSE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING STATE ORGANIZATION WHATEVER THAT MAY BE ABSOLUTE OR LIMITED MONARCHY CONVENTION CONSULATE EMPIRE OF THIS OR THAT NAPOLEON OR BOULANGER CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY COMMUNE OR REPUBLIC IS ABSOLUTELY LAWFUL AND NOT OPPOSED TO MORALITY AND CHRISTIANITY
AND BEFORE A YEAR HAS PASSED THESE GOOD INTELLIGENT HEALTHY-MINDED LADS WILL BE AS BRUTAL BEINGS AS THEIR INSTRUCTORS
I KNOW THAT IN SWITZERLAND IN THE YEAR 1890 THERE WERE MEN IN PRISON IN THE CASTLE OF CHILLON FOR DECLINING TO SERVE IN THE ARMY WHOSE RESOLUTION WAS NOT SHAKEN BY THEIR PUNISHMENT
RULERS ALWAYS TRY TO IMPLICATE AS MANY CITIZENS AS POSSIBLE IN ALL THE CRIMES COMMITTED IN THEIR SUPPORT
THEY CANNOT ALL START OFF AT ONCE BECAUSE ONE HANGS ON TO ANOTHER AND HINDERS HER FROM SEPARATING FROM THE SWARM AND THEREFORE THEY ALL CONTINUE TO HANG THERE
WE SEE THAT IT IS REALLY THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
IT IS THE REVEREND FATHER COME TO ADMINISTER THE OATH
FROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RELIGION OF CHRIST AND ALL PRECEDING RELIGIONS BASED ON THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE FOLLOWS A CORRESPONDING DIFFERENCE IN THE SPECIAL PRECEPTS OF THE STATE THEORY AND THE CHRISTIAN PRECEPTS
FOR THEY SAY AND DO NOT MATT
THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE FORM OF A HISTORY OF HERESY
BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER EXTERNAL MEANS BY WHICH MEN REACH CHRISTIANITY AND BY WHICH THE TRANSITION IS LESS GRADUAL
TO-DAY LET US ASSUME POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF A RULER WHO CAN BE ENDURED BUT TO-MORROW IT MAY BE SEIZED BY A BIRON AN ELIZABETH A CATHERINE A POUGACHEF A NAPOLEON I OR A NAPOLEON III
THE SOVEREIGN POWERS OF THE WORLD HAVE IN THE COURSE OF TIME BEEN BROUGHT INTO A POSITION IN WHICH FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION THEY MUST REQUIRE FROM ALL MEN ACTIONS WHICH CANNOT BE PERFORMED BY MEN WHO PROFESS TRUE CHRISTIANITY
THAT THIS IS THE--FOR SOME REASON TERRIBLE--DOCTRINE OF ANARCHISM WITH WHICH A MENTAL PICTURE OF ALL KINDS OF HORRORS IS ASSOCIATED
THE EXISTENCE OF ANY KIND OF STANDING ARMY ALL MILITARY CHIEFTAINS ALL MONUMENTS COMMEMORATIVE OF VICTORY OVER A FALLEN FOE ALL TROPHIES WON IN BATTLE ALL CELEBRATIONS IN HONOR OF MILITARY EXPLOITS ALL APPROPRIATIONS FOR DEFENSE BY ARMS
YOU ARE STILL TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID HERE
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE SOLE EXPLANATION OF THIS ASTONISHING PHENOMENON IS THAT THEY ARE IN THE CONDITION OF THE HYPNOTIZED WHO THEY SAY FEEL AND ACT LIKE THE CREATURES THEY ARE COMMANDED BY THE HYPNOTIZER TO REPRESENT
AND BY THE WAY IT IS PRECISELY WHAT IS TAUGHT BY CHRISTIANITY SO THINK THE ADVOCATES OF POSITIVIST COMMUNISTIC OR SOCIALISTIC FRATERNITY
WHEN THIS COMES TO PASS THE QUESTION WHETHER MEN ARE READY TO DISCARD THE GOVERNMENTAL TYPE IS SOLVED
AND THEY DO NOT SEEM EVEN TO NOTICE THAT IT IS A TEST THAT THERE IS ANY CHOICE ABOUT IT
BUT ONE YEAR PASSED THEN TWO AND THREE AND STILL THE BOOK DID NOT APPEAR
DIRECTLY HE GIVES IN TO THE FIRE AND CUTS OFF WHAT IS ON FIRE FROM A LARGE BUILDING THE BUILDING ITSELF IS ALIGHT AT BOTH ENDS
TO SUPPOSE THAT HUMAN LIFE IS GOING IN THE DIRECTION TO WHICH CHRIST POINTED IT IS JUST LIKE SUPPOSING THAT A LITTLE BOAT AFLOAT ON A RABID RIVER AND DIRECTING ITS COURSE ALMOST EXACTLY AGAINST THE CURRENT WILL PROGRESS IN THAT DIRECTION
ANOTHER AS A SOLDIER BOUND BY HIS MILITARY OATH TO CARRY OUT ALL HE IS COMMANDED WITHOUT REFLECTION
A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THIS HYPOCRISY WAS THE SOLICITUDE DISPLAYED BY THE RUSSIAN LANDOWNERS LAST YEAR THEIR EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE FAMINE WHICH THEY HAD CAUSED AND BY WHICH THEY PROFITED SELLING NOT ONLY BREAD AT THE HIGHEST PRICE BUT EVEN POTATO HAULM AT FIVE RUBLES THE DESSIATINE ABOUT 2 AND FOUR-FIFTHS ACRES FOR FUEL TO THE FREEZING PEASANTS OR TAKE A MERCHANT WHOSE WHOLE TRADE--LIKE ALL TRADE INDEED--IS FOUNDED ON A SERIES OF TRICKERY BY MEANS OF WHICH PROFITING BY THE IGNORANCE OR NEED OF OTHERS HE BUYS GOODS BELOW THEIR VALUE AND SELLS THEM AGAIN ABOVE THEIR VALUE
IN THE SAME WAY THE JUDGES WHO WRONGFULLY ADJUDGED THE FOREST TO THE PROPRIETOR DID SO SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY FANCIED THEMSELVES NOT SIMPLY MEN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND SO BOUND TO BE GUIDED IN EVERYTHING ONLY BY WHAT THEY CONSIDER RIGHT BUT UNDER THE INTOXICATING INFLUENCE OF POWER IMAGINED THEMSELVES THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JUSTICE WHICH CANNOT ERR
WHILE OSTENSIBLY WIDENING ITS REALM ONE UNDERMINES IT
WHATEVER COMES FROM A HEART SUCH AS HIS SWELLING WITH ANGER AND PITY AT THE SUFFERINGS OF HUMANITY CANNOT FAIL TO REACH THE HEARTS OF OTHERS
SO MUCH FOR THE DISADVANTAGES OF NON-COMPLIANCE
ALL MEN ARE BROUGHT UP TO THE HABIT OF OBEYING THE LAWS OF THE STATE BEFORE EVERYTHING
IN THESE DAYS ONLY A MAN WHO IS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OR ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT TO THE VITAL QUESTIONS WITH WHICH RELIGION DEALS CAN REMAIN IN THE FAITH OF THE CHURCH
HOW THEN CAN THE MANIFESTATIONS OF TRUTH DISAPPEAR THROUGH OUR REALIZING IT
UNION SINCE HYPOCRITES CONCEAL FROM THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THE TRUTH THEY KNOW--HYPOCRISY TURNS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE TO EVIL--HYPOCRISY DISTORTS THE IDEA OF GOOD AND EVIL AND SO STANDS IN THE WAY OF THE PROGRESS OF MEN TOWARD PERFECTION--UNDISGUISED CRIMINALS AND MALEFACTORS DO LESS HARM THAN THOSE WHO LIVE BY LEGALIZED VIOLENCE DISGUISED BY HYPOCRISY--ALL MEN FEEL THE INIQUITY OF OUR LIFE AND WOULD LONG AGO HAVE TRANSFORMED IT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN DISSIMULATED BY HYPOCRISY--BUT SEEM TO HAVE REACHED THE EXTREME LIMITS OF HYPOCRISY AND WE NEED ONLY MAKE AN EFFORT OF CONSCIENCE TO AWAKEN AS FROM A NIGHTMARE TO A DIFFERENT REALITY
THEY TRY TO CONCEAL THIS BUT IN VAIN
WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES TO-DAY
SOME OF THEM IN NEW SHEEPSKIN PELISSES WITH KNITTED SCARVES ROUND THEIR NECKS THEIR EYES SWOLLEN FROM DRINKING ARE SHOUTING WILDLY TO ONE ANOTHER TO SHOW THEIR COURAGE
VIOLENCE WHICH IS HELD UP AS THE MEANS OF SUPPORTING THE CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION OF LIFE NOT ONLY FAILS TO PRODUCE THAT EFFECT IT EVEN HINDERS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF LIFE FROM BEING WHAT IT MIGHT AND OUGHT TO BE
CONTENTS
ALL THESE MATERIAL REFORMS MAY BE REALIZED BUT THE POSITION OF HUMANITY WILL NOT BE IMPROVED
THERE ARE CASES TOO WHEN MEN COME TO THEMSELVES JUST BEFORE THE PERPETRATION OF THE CRIME
OF LATE THIS TENDENCY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN A VERY OBVIOUS MANNER BY THE OBLIGATION OF ALL CITIZENS TO TAKE PART IN LEGAL PROCESSES AS JURORS IN THE ARMY AS SOLDIERS IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AS ELECTORS OR MEMBERS
IF WE TALK OF BESTOWING FREEDOM ON CHRISTIANS OR WITHHOLDING IT FROM THEM WE ARE OBVIOUSLY TALKING NOT OF REAL CHRISTIANS BUT OF PEOPLE WHO ONLY CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS
AND THEREFORE THE ASSERTION OF THE CHAMPIONS OF THE STATE THAT IF THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT WERE SUPPRESSED THE WICKED WOULD OPPRESS THE GOOD NOT ONLY FAILS TO SHOW THAT THAT IS TO BE DREADED SINCE IT IS JUST WHAT HAPPENS NOW BUT PROVES ON THE CONTRARY THAT IT IS GOVERNMENTAL POWER WHICH ENABLES THE WICKED TO OPPRESS THE GOOD AND IS THE EVIL MOST DESIRABLE TO SUPPRESS AND THAT IT IS BEING GRADUALLY SUPPRESSED IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS
THEY MUST HAVE FOUND A LAW FOR IT
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS YET I LIVE BY WORKING IN A BANK OR MERCANTILE HOUSE OR SHOP AT MAKING ALL GOODS DEARER FOR MY BROTHERS
THINK OF YOUR DUTIES--NOT YOUR SUPPOSED DUTIES AS A LANDOWNER TO YOUR ESTATE AS A MERCHANT TO YOUR BUSINESS AS EMPEROR MINISTER OR OFFICIAL TO THE STATE BUT OF YOUR REAL DUTIES THE DUTIES THAT FOLLOW FROM YOUR REAL POSITION AS A BEING CALLED INTO LIFE AND ENDOWED WITH REASON AND LOVE
EACH OF THE BEES KNOWS THIS AND DESIRES TO CHANGE HER OWN AND THE OTHERS POSITION BUT NO ONE OF THEM CAN DO IT TILL THE REST OF THEM DO IT

BUT IF ONE IMAGINES ONESELF IN THE POSITION OF THE MEN WHO CONSTITUTE THE CHURCH WE SEE THEY COULD NOT ACT DIFFERENTLY
THE SUB-COMMITTEE PROPOSES 1 THAT THE ANNUAL PEACE CONGRESS SHOULD BE HELD EITHER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE MEETING OF THE ANNUAL SUB-PARLIAMENTARY CONFERENCE OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT IN THE SAME TOWN
THIS IS STATED IN ALL CATECHISMS OR BOOKS USED IN SCHOOLS
THE SOBS AND GROANS OF THE CROWD GREW LOUDER
NOWADAYS WE HAVE NO SUCH RELIGIOUS LAW TO EXONERATE US FROM OUR DUTIES TO OUR NEIGHBORS I AM NOT SPEAKING NOW OF THE COARSE AND IGNORANT PERSONS WHO STILL FANCY THEIR SINS CAN BE ABSOLVED BY CONFESSION TO A PRIEST OR BY THE ABSOLUTION OF THE POPE ON THE CONTRARY THE LAW OF THE GOSPEL WHICH WE ALL PROFESS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER DIRECTLY DEFINES THESE DUTIES
SETTLE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR LIFE
LE SENS DE LA VIE PP
BUT FOR MEN WHO OBSERVE HOW ONE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE HAS MORE EFFECT ON THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS THAN DOZENS OF ROYAL AUDIENCES OR PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THESE AUDIENCES AND INTERVIEWS AND DEBATES IN PARLIAMENTS DO NOT DIRECT THE COURSE OF AFFAIRS BUT SOMETHING INDEPENDENT OF ALL THAT WHICH CANNOT BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE
AND TO RECOGNIZE AND TO PROFESS THE REVEALED TRUTH WHICH IS ALWAYS IN OUR POWER
SO MUCH FOR THE ECONOMIC CONTRADICTION
BUT THE FURTHER THEY PROCEEDED ALONG THE STREET WHERE HEALTHY PEOPLE WERE FREELY MOVING ABOUT THE MORE TIMID THEY BECAME AND THEY PRESSED CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE DOCTOR HINDERING HIM FROM WALKING
TO ENTER INTO THE PROOF OF THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS ARTICLE FOR I HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED THE SPACE AT MY COMMAND AND HE CONCLUDES IN A TRANQUIL SPIRIT
I CANNOT PROVE THE NEED OR THE HARM OF GOVERNMENTS IN GENERAL
ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS WHAT NECESSITATED THE CORRUPTION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS NOW THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO ITS ACCEPTANCE IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE
AND THOSE WHO SPEAK THUS ARE ACTING PRECISELY LIKE A MAN WHO HAVING NO IDEA OF WHAT A CIRCLE IS SHOULD DECLARE THAT THIS REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY POINT OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE SHOULD BE AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER IS EXAGGERATED
VIOLENCE EVEN IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CASE WHEN IT IS NOT USED SIMPLY FOR SOME PERSONAL AIMS OF THOSE IN POWER ALWAYS PUNISHES UNDER THE ONE INELASTIC FORMULA OF THE LAW WHAT HAS LONG BEFORE BEEN CONDEMNED BY PUBLIC OPINION
THOUSANDS OF DISCIPLINED TROOPS TRAINED TO MURDER AND SUBJECT TO ONE MAN'S WILL
THERE IS MUCH TO BE GAINED BY SEPARATION FROM IT
ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIS VIEWS BUT NO ONE CAN SERIOUSLY DENY THE ORIGINALITY BOLDNESS AND DEPTH OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION WHICH HE DEVELOPS WITH SUCH POWERFUL LOGIC
CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY BELIEVERS
FROM THE COMMAND RESIST NOT EVIL M
IF THEY HAD BEEN REVOLUTIONISTS ADVOCATING AND PRACTICING VIOLENCE AND MURDER THEIR SUPPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY MATTER
AS IT IS SAID IN THE GOSPEL NO MAN CAN COME UNTO ME EXCEPT THE FATHER WHICH HATH SENT ME DRAW HIM THAT IS TO SAY THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE DOES NOT DEPEND ON EXTERNAL PHENOMENA BUT ON CERTAIN INNER SPIRITUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAN WHICH ESCAPE OUR OBSERVATION
THE MAN OF THE SO-CALLED EDUCATED CLASSES LIVES IN STILL MORE GLARING INCONSISTENCY AND SUFFERING
THEY KILLED AND BURNT WITCHES THEY KILLED ARISTOCRATS AND GIRONDISTS THEY KILLED THEIR ENEMIES BECAUSE THOSE WHO WERE IN AUTHORITY REGARDED THEM AS DANGEROUS FOR THE PEOPLE
JUST AS IN A WICKER BASKET ALL THE ENDS ARE SO HIDDEN AWAY THAT IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM IN THE STATE ORGANIZATION THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED IS SO HIDDEN AWAY THAT MEN WILL COMMIT THE MOST ATROCIOUS ACTS WITHOUT SEEING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM
AND WHEN THERE ARE NO LONGER MEN WILLING TO FILL THESE OFFICES THESE OFFICES THEMSELVES WILL DISAPPEAR TOO
WE DO NOT WANT ALL TO BE AS POOR AS THE POOR
AND GREAT WAS THE FALL OF IT MATT
JUSTICE CAN HAVE NO BINDING FORCE ON A RULER OR RULERS WHO KEEP MEN DELUDED AND DRILLED IN READINESS FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE--SOLDIERS AND BY MEANS OF THEM CONTROL OTHERS
AFTER MY THOUGHTS HAD FOR TWO YEARS BEEN TURNED IN THE SAME DIRECTION FATE SEEMED EXPRESSLY TO HAVE BROUGHT ME FACE TO FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE WITH A FACT WHICH SHOWED ME ABSOLUTELY UNMISTAKABLY IN PRACTICE WHAT HAD LONG BEEN CLEAR TO ME IN THEORY THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF OUR SOCIETY RESTS NOT AS PEOPLE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING THE PRESENT ORDER OF THINGS LIKE TO IMAGINE ON CERTAIN PRINCIPLES OF JURISPRUDENCE BUT ON SIMPLE BRUTE FORCE ON THE MURDER AND TORTURE OF MEN
FREEDOM IS AN INALIENABLE POSSESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN
ALL AT ONCE ONE MAN IN PERM ANOTHER IN TULA A THIRD IN MOSCOW AND A FOURTH IN KALOUGA DECLARE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE OATH AND THOUGH THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM THEY ALL EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL ON THE SAME GROUNDS--NAMELY THAT SWEARING IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAW OF CHRIST AND THAT EVEN IF SWEARING HAD NOT BEEN FORBIDDEN THEY COULD NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW OF CHRIST PROMISE TO PERFORM THE EVIL ACTIONS REQUIRED OF THEM IN THE OATH SUCH AS INFORMING AGAINST ALL SUCH AS MAY ACT AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OR DEFENDING THEIR GOVERNMENT WITH FIREARMS OR ATTACKING ITS ENEMIES
AND AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART YOU KNOW YOURSELF THAT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE EXISTING ORGANIZATION HAS OUTLIVED ITS TIME AND MUST INEVITABLY BE RECONSTRUCTED ON NEW PRINCIPLES AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO OBLIGATION UPON YOU TO SACRIFICE YOUR SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY TO SUPPORT IT
THEY KNOW THAT AFTER MURDERING AND TORTURING THE DEFENSELESS EACH OF THEM WILL BE ASHAMED TO FACE HIS BETROTHED OR THE WOMAN HE IS COURTING
FROM THESE TWO PASSAGES IN WHICH THE WORD CHURCH IS USED IN THE SIGNIFICATION MERELY OF AN ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN DEDUCED ALL THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND BY THE CHURCH
OF THE WORKS OF JOUKOVSKY EVERY WAR EVEN THE MOST HUMANELY CONDUCTED WITH ALL ITS ORDINARY CONSEQUENCES THE DESTRUCTION OF HARVESTS ROBBERIES THE LICENSE AND DEBAUCHERY AND THE MURDER WITH THE JUSTIFICATIONS OF ITS NECESSITY AND JUSTICE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF MILITARY EXPLOITS THE WORSHIP OF THE FLAG THE PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS THE FEIGNED SOLICITUDE FOR THE WOUNDED AND SO ON DOES MORE IN ONE YEAR TO PERVERT MEN'S MINDS THAN THOUSANDS OF ROBBERIES MURDERS AND ARSONS PERPETRATED DURING HUNDREDS OF YEARS BY INDIVIDUAL MEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION
THE ELEMENTS THAT MADE UP THE FORCE SENT TO TOULA AND THE CONDUCT OF THE MEN COMPOSING IT--HOW THESE MEN COULD CARRY OUT SUCH ACTS--THE EXPLANATION IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN IGNORANCE CONVICTION CRUELTY HEARTLESSNESS OR WANT OF MORAL SENSE--THEY DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING ORDER WHICH THEY CONSIDER IT EVERY MAN'S DUTY TO SUPPORT--THE BASIS OF THIS CONVICTION THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE--IN THE UPPER CLASSES THIS CONVICTION IS BASED ON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE EXISTING ORDER FOR THEMSELVES--BUT WHAT FORCES MEN OF THE LOWER CLASSES TO BELIEVE IN THE IMMUTABILITY OF THE EXISTING ORDER FROM WHICH THEY DERIVE NO ADVANTAGE AND WHICH THEY AID IN MAINTAINING FACTS CONTRARY TO THEIR CONSCIENCE?--THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE LOWER CLASSES BEING DELUDED BY THE UPPER BOTH AS TO THE INEVITABILITY OF THE EXISTING ORDER AND THE LAWFULNESS OF THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN IT--DECEPTION IN GENERAL--SPECIAL FORM OF DECEPTION IN
BUT I SAY UNTO YOU RESIST NOT EVIL
WHICH IS MORE NECESSARY TO THE GOOD OF HUMANITY IN WHICH WAY IS MEN'S HAPPINESS BEST TO BE SECURED BY MAINTAINING THE ORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT OR BY DESTROYING IT AND REPLACING IT BY CHRISTIANITY
IT NEITHER FEARS GOD NOR REGARDS MAN
ARTICLE 87
BUT THEY ONLY DO NOT ASCRIBE TO THIS COMMAND THE SPECIAL EXCLUSIVE VALUE ATTACHED TO IT BY SECTARIANS
ALL--OR AT LEAST THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE--ARE CHRISTIANS AND ALL MEN ARE CALLED UPON FOR MILITARY SERVICE
BUT WHEN WILL IT BE
THEY DEVOTE THEMSELVES UNSPARINGLY TO THEIR TASK OF USEFULNESS MAKING ONE DISCOVERY AFTER ANOTHER ENLARGING THE SPHERE OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE EXTENDING THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE ADDING EACH DAY SOME NEW STORE TO THE SUM OF KNOWLEDGE GAINING EACH DAY PROSPERITY EASE STRENGTH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
AND THERE ARE TRUTHS ONLY VAGUELY AS IT WERE DISTANTLY APPREHENDED BY HIM
A LETTER OF THANKS TO HER MAJESTY FOR PERMISSION TO VISIT WINDROR CASTLE
39 Q
CHURCHMEN SUBSTITUTE FOR CHRISTIANITY THE VERSION THEY HAVE FRAMED OF IT FOR THEMSELVES AND THIS VIEW OF CHRISTIANITY THEY REGARD AS THE ONE INFALLIBLY TRUE ONE
IS IT TRUE THAT THEY ARE GENUINE AND THAT MIRACLES ARE WORKED THROUGH THEM
AND YOU NEED ONLY DO THAT AND YOUR SITUATION WILL CHANGE DIRECTLY OF ITSELF
THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN LIFE AND THE CONSCIENCE MAY BE REMOVED IN TWO WAYS
BUT NOT AT ALL
IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY THE SPECIALTY OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO OBEY BUT TO ENFORCE OBEDIENCE
IT HAS BECOME PARTICULARLY INDISPENSABLE NOW IN THE FACE OF COMMUNISM SOCIALISM ANARCHISM AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT GENERALLY
E BY MURDER AND TORTURE OBEDIENCE TO THE DECISION OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES WAS TO BE SECURED
EVEN IF WE ADMIT THAT UNDER A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIALLY UNFAVORABLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS IN FRANCE IN 1870 ANY GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE FORCIBLY OVERTURNED AND THE POWER TRANSFERRED TO OTHER HANDS THE NEW AUTHORITY WOULD RARELY BE LESS OPPRESSIVE THAN THE OLD ONE
LEARNED MEN--BENEFACTORS OF ALL--SPEND THEIR LIVES IN WORKING IN SEEKING WHAT CAN AID WHAT BE OF USE WHAT CAN ALLEVIATE THE LOT OF THEIR FELLOWS
NATIONS HAVE NEVER SUBJUGATED OTHER NATIONS BY VIOLENCE ALONE
THAT IS ALL
THAT PROCESS GOES ON UNCEASINGLY AND MEN ARE PASSING OVER TO CHRISTIANITY ONE AFTER ANOTHER BY THIS INNER WAY
THEY'LL GIVE OVER MAKING COMMOTIONS I WARRANT YOU
SOMETHING DIFFERENT MAY BE TALKED OF AND WRITTEN OF IN THE CAPITALS
WHY DO THEY ALL HOLD MILITARY REVIEWS WHY DO THEY ORGANIZE MANEUVERS DISTRIBUTE REWARDS TO THE MILITARY AND RAISE MONUMENTS TO GENERALS AND SUCCESSFUL COMMANDERS
BUT EVERY MAN OF THE MODERN WORLD RECOGNIZES THAT OUR SALVATION LIES IN FULFILLING THE LAW OF CHRIST
IT IS JUST WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OF LATE YEARS AT RECRUITING SESSIONS
IT IS HERE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO IS A SOLDIER CAN AND OUGHT TO CARRY OUT ALL THE ORDERS OF HIS SUPERIOR WITHOUT EXCEPTION
THE SPECTATORS WHO ONE WOULD SUPPOSE COULD HAVE NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE AFFAIR LOOKED RATHER WITH SYMPATHY THAN WITH DISAPPROVAL AT ALL THESE PEOPLE PREPARING TO CARRY OUT THIS INFAMOUS ACTION
TELL THESE PEOPLE THAT THE WHOLE MATTER RESTS ON THE PERSONAL ATTITUDE OF EACH MAN TO THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS QUESTION PUT NOWADAYS TO EVERYONE THE QUESTION THAT IS WHETHER IT IS LAWFUL OR UNLAWFUL FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS SHARE OF MILITARY SERVICE AND THESE LEARNED GENTLEMEN WILL SHRUG THEIR SHOULDERS AND NOT CONDESCEND TO LISTEN OR TO ANSWER YOU
EVERY GOVERNMENT KNOWS BY WHAT MEANS AND IN WHAT MANNER TO DEFEND ITSELF FROM REVOLUTIONISTS AND HAS RESOURCES FOR DOING SO AND THEREFORE DOES NOT DREAD THESE EXTERNAL FOES
INDEED CAN ONE IMAGINE A MORE STRIKING INSTANCE OF MEN FLOGGING THEMSELVES THAN THE SUBMISSIVENESS WITH WHICH MEN OF OUR TIMES WILL PERFORM THE VERY DUTIES REQUIRED OF THEM TO KEEP THEM IN SLAVERY ESPECIALLY THE DUTY OF MILITARY SERVICE
ONE CANNOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THEIR TRADITIONS THIS STATEMENT TOO IS MISLEADING
THE FORCE OF HIS ANIMAL NATURE AND THE FORCE OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF KINSHIP TO GOD
THE SAME SOVEREIGNS HAVE STILL THE SAME AUDIENCES AND INTERVIEWS HUNTS AND BANQUETS AND BALLS AND UNIFORMS
THEY WILL SAY IN THEIR DEFENSE THAT AUTHORITY IS GIVEN BY GOD THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY THAT PROPERTY IS NOT OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY THAT THE RICH YOUNG MAN WAS ONLY COMMANDED TO SELL ALL HE HAD AND GIVE TO THE POOR IF HE WISHED TO BE PERFECT THAT THE EXISTING DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY AND OUR COMMERCIAL SYSTEM MUST ALWAYS REMAIN AS THEY ARE AND ARE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL AND SO ON
AND WHEN THEY LET HIM GO HE SEEMS TO SHAKE HIMSELF AND GO BACK TO HIS FORMER LIFE AND HE CONTINUES TO DISCOURSE UPON THE DIGNITY OF MAN LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY AS BEFORE
THAT THEY WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT
BUT IF THERE IS A PUBLIC OPINION WHICH CAN FORCE GOVERNMENTS TO DELAY THEIR OPERATIONS FOR A FIXED PERIOD THE SAME PUBLIC OPINION CAN FORCE GOVERNMENTS NOT TO DECLARE WAR AT ALL
BUT IF IT BE TRUE THAT GOVERNMENTAL POWER WILL DISAPPEAR WHEN THOSE IN POWER BECOME SO CHRISTIAN THAT THEY RENOUNCE POWER OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND THERE ARE NO MEN FOUND WILLING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE AND EVEN IF THIS PROCESS IS ALREADY GOING ON SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER WHEN WILL THAT COME TO PASS
THE SAME TAX COLLECTORS BUT THEY ARE LESS AND LESS CAPABLE OF TAKING MEN'S PROPERTY FROM THEM BY FORCE AND IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT PEOPLE CAN COLLECT ALL THAT IS NECESSARY BY VOLUNTARY SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT THEIR AID
ALL THAT THEY PREACH IS AN EXTERNAL OBSERVANCE OF THE RITES OF IDOLATRY
WE KNOW AND CANNOT HELP KNOWING THAT THE LAW OF OUR COUNTRY IS NOT THE ONE ETERNAL LAW
ALSO AT THE ADOPTION OF RESOLUTIONS TO A LIKE EFFECT BY THE NORWEGIAN STORTHING AND BY THE ITALIAN CHAMBER
I KNOW ONLY WHAT I NEED AND DO NOT NEED WHAT I CAN DO AND WHAT I CANNOT
EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WITH THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES ASSIMILATED INVOLUNTARILY IN HIS CONSCIENCE FINDS HIMSELF IN PRECISELY THE POSITION OF A MAN ASLEEP WHO DREAMS THAT HE IS OBLIGED TO DO SOMETHING WHICH EVEN IN HIS DREAM HE KNOWS HE OUGHT NOT TO DO
BETHINK YOURSELVES WHETHER IT IS RIGHTEOUS TO OBEY MAN MORE THAN GOD SAID PETER AND JOHN
BUT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT SEEMED AS UNNATURAL AND ALARMING TO MEN AS THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IN ITS TRUE SENSE SEEMS TO-DAY
WHETHER A MAN EATS OR DOES NOT EAT WORKS OR RESTS RUNS RISKS OR AVOIDS THEM IF HE HAS A CONSCIENCE HE ACTS THUS ONLY BECAUSE HE CONSIDERS IT RIGHT AND RATIONAL BECAUSE HE CONSIDERS THAT TO ACT THUS IS IN HARMONY WITH TRUTH OR ELSE BECAUSE HE HAS MADE THIS REFLECTION IN THE PAST
XXI
WE THINK TO-DAY THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE--OF UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD SUPPRESSION OF NATIONAL DISTINCTIONS ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE STRANGE INJUNCTION OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE--DEMAND WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
DIVINES AND ECCLESIASTICAL DIGNITARIES BEGAN TO CONCERN THEMSELVES ONLY ABOUT SUBDUING THE WHOLE WORLD TO THEIR AUTHORITY INCITED MEN AGAINST ONE ANOTHER TO MURDER AND PLUNDER AND IN CREED AND LIFE REDUCED CHRISTIANITY TO A NULLITY
AND THEREFORE THE CHURCHES CANNOT BUT MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO OBSCURE THE MEANING OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND TO ATTRACT MEN TO THEMSELVES
TRANSLATIONS FOR LONG PASSAGES OF FRENCH FOLLOW IN THE FOOTNOTES
BUT I CAN SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT I DO NOT NEED IT AND THAT I CANNOT DO IT
THEY HAVE SO LONG BEEN PERSUADING OTHER PEOPLE OF THIS THAT AT LAST THEY HAVE PERSUADED THEMSELVES OF IT
IN THE SECOND THEORY OF LIFE A MAN'S LIFE IS LIMITED NOT TO HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY BUT TO CERTAIN SOCIETIES AND CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS
SI CETTE MEME UNANIMITE QUI SE REVELE DANS LES CROYANCES ESSENTIELLES SE RETROUVE POUR REPOUSSER TELLES OU TELLES TENDANCES NE SERONS NOUS PAS EN DROIT DE CONCLURE QUE CES TENDANCES ETAIENT EN DESACORD FLAGRANT AVEC LES PRINCIPES FONDAMENTAUX DU CHRISTIANISME
THE TOILING MASSES THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF MANKIND WHO ARE SUFFERING UNDER THE INCESSANT MEANINGLESS AND HOPELESS TOIL AND PRIVATION IN WHICH THEIR WHOLE LIFE IS SWALLOWED UP STILL FIND THEIR KEENEST SUFFERING IN THE GLARING CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT IS AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE ACCORDING TO ALL THE BELIEFS HELD BY THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THAT CONDITION AND KEEP THEM IN IT
BUT THERE ARE GRAVER INTERESTS AT STAKE
EXTERNAL OBSERVANCES AND THE SERVICE OF TRUTH AND GOODNESS ARE FOR THE MOST PART DIFFICULT TO COMBINE
CHAPTER IX
IT WAS NATURAL THAT PERSONS WHO CONSIDERED IT THEIR DUTY TO BEAR ALL THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS OF WAR IN DEFENSE OF THEIR COUNTRY SHOULD FEEL RESENTMENT AGAINST THOSE PERSONS WHO HAD FOR LONG SHARED WITH THEM THE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROTECTION OF GOVERNMENT AND WHO NOW IN TIME OF NEED AND DANGER WOULD NOT SHARE IN BEARING THE LABORS AND DANGERS OF ITS DEFENSE
GOVERNMENTS FEEL THAT IT IS SO AND STRENGTHEN THE FORCE OF THEIR DISCIPLINED ARMIES
WHERE IS THE DEFINITION OF HUMANITY
AND MARVELOUS TO SAY SO GREAT IS THE DULLNESS OF MEN THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THESE THEORIES IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE EVERY STEP THEY TAKE SHOWS HOW UNWORTHY THEY ARE OF BELIEF
NOT TO SPEAK OF ALL THE OTHER CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN MODERN LIFE AND THE CONSCIENCE THE PERMANENTLY ARMED CONDITION OF EUROPE TOGETHER WITH ITS PROFESSION OF CHRISTIANITY IS ALONE ENOUGH TO DRIVE ANY MAN TO DESPAIR TO DOUBT OF THE SANITY OF MANKIND AND TO TERMINATE AN EXISTENCE IN THIS SENSELESS AND BRUTAL WORLD
AND ABOVE ALL IT IS UNSAFE TO PUT ONESELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE POWER OF OTHERS BUT THE TIME CAME WHEN THE SAVAGE ON ONE HAND FELT THOUGH VAGUELY THE VALUE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND OF ITS CHIEF MOTOR POWER SOCIAL CENSURE OR SOCIAL APPROBATION--GLORY AND WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS PERSONAL LIFE BECAME SO GREAT THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF HIS OLD THEORY OF LIFE
MAN IS CERTAINLY NOT FREE IF WE IMAGINE HIM STATIONARY AND IF WE FORGET THAT THE LIFE OF A MAN AND OF HUMANITY IS NOTHING BUT A CONTINUAL MOVEMENT FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT FROM A LOWER STAGE OF TRUTH TO A HIGHER FROM A TRUTH MORE ALLOYED WITH ERRORS TO A TRUTH MORE PURIFIED FROM THEM
THE VERY MENTION OF THE FACT THAT THE DUTY OF NON-RESISTANCE ENTERS INTO CHRIST'S TEACHING IS REGARDED AS SATISFACTORY PROOF OF THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF THE WHOLE TEACHING
IT IS UNREASONABLE SAID THE SAVAGE TO SACRIFICE MY PEACE OF MIND OR MY LIFE IN DEFENSE OF SOMETHING INCOMPREHENSIBLE IMPALPABLE AND CONVENTIONAL--FAMILY TRIBE OR NATION
ON ITS APPEARANCE IT HAD AS I HAD ANTICIPATED BEEN FORBIDDEN AND OUGHT THEREFORE BY LAW TO HAVE BEEN BURNT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM IS A TABLE COVERED WITH GREEN CLOTH ON WHICH THERE ARE PAPERS LYING AND A THREE-CORNERED ORNAMENT SURMOUNTED BY AN EAGLE--THE ZERTZAL
SO THAT OCCASIONS FOR FULFILLING THE COMMANDMENT OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE ARE TAUGHT FOR THE MOST PART AS OCCASIONS FOR NOT FULFILLING IT
INDEED IT IS ABSURD EVEN TO SPEAK OF CHRISTIANS RULING
ONE WITH GRAY BEARD AND BENT BACK LEANING ON A STAFF LIKE THE OLD GRANDFATHER
THEY ARE LIKE THE BALLAST WITH WHICH EVERY SHIP IS ALWAYS LOADED AT ONCE TO KEEP IT UPRIGHT AND ENABLE IT TO SAIL PROPERLY
BUT SUCH A LOVE CANNOT EXIST
AND HOWEVER MEN MAY TRY TO CONCEAL IT ONE OF THE FIRST CONDITIONS OF CHRISTIAN LIFE IS LOVE NOT IN WORDS BUT IN DEEDS
FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS THEY GO ON LIVING AT HOME AND MOST OF THAT TIME THEY ARE JAUNTING THAT IS DRINKING
PERSONNE AU TEMPS DE PLATON N'EUT OSE COUVRIR DE SON NOM UNE DOCTRINE QUI N'EUT PAS FAIT PLACE A LA THEORIE DES IDEES
CHRIST REQUIRES OF ME TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS I WOULD THEY SHOULD DO UNTO ME
A SKILLED PROFICIENT IN THAT LINE A SLAUGHTERER OF GENIUS VON MOLTKE IN REPLY TO THE PEACE DELEGATES ONCE UTTERED THESE STRANGE WORDS
AND HE WILL NOT ONLY FEEL HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY FREE FROM EVERY HUMAN POWER BUT WILL EVEN CEASE TO REGARD SUCH POWER AS AT ALL ABLE TO HAMPER ANYONE
THE MORE MEANS THERE WILL BE OF DIFFUSING INCONSISTENT LIES AND HYPOCRISIES AND THE MORE DISUNITED AND CONSEQUENTLY MISERABLE WILL MEN BECOME WHICH INDEED IS WHAT WE SEE ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE
ATTITUDE OF MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY TO WAR
THE POSITION OF THE BEES ON THE BRANCH IS TEMPORARY AND MUST INEVITABLY BE CHANGED
WHO CARRIED FORWARD THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT STARTED BY THE PHILOSOPHERS OF THE END OF LAST CENTURY
AND THEIR ATTITUDE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
ANOTHER PART OF ITS PRACTICE CONSISTS IN THE MAINTENANCE OF IDOL-WORSHIP IN THE MOST LITERAL MEANING OF THE WORD
ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF CHRISTIANITY BY THESE PHENOMENA IS LIKE A DEAF MAN'S JUDGING OF THE CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF MUSIC BY SEEING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS
WERE NOT THE OLD PRACTICES IN CHURCHES ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WITH THEIR SPECIAL LIGHTING GOLD SPLENDOR CANDLES CHOIRS ORGAN BELLS VESTMENTS INTONING ETC
THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE READY TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DIMINISHING
STATE VIOLENCE CAN ONLY CEASE WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE WICKED MEN IN SOCIETY SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS ASSUMING IN THIS OF COURSE THAT SINCE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE WICKED MEN IT CAN NEVER CEASE
THEN THE GOVERNOR ORDERED THEM TO BRING ANOTHER BENCH AND TO PUT A PLANK ACROSS THEM
AND YET THEY ALL DO IT
AND WHAT A STRANGE THING IT IS THAT FOR ALL THESE LAST FIFTEEN CENTURIES NO ONE HAS HAD A CANVAS AMPLE ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT CHRIST WHOM WE PROFESS TO BELIEVE IN SAYS SOMETHING UTTERLY UNLIKE WHAT HE DOES SAY
AND I AM--A SLAVE HUMILIATED AND HATED AND HE TOO IS FILLED WITH HATRED AND TRIES TO FIND MEANS TO ESCAPE FROM HIS POSITION TO SHAKE OFF THE ENEMY WHO IS OVER-RIDING HIM AND TO OPPRESS HIM IN TURN
THEN MEN ARE IN AN ABNORMAL WAVERING CONDITION FEELING THE NECESSITY OF FOLLOWING THE NEW IDEAL AND YET NOT BOLD ENOUGH TO BREAK WITH THE OLD-ESTABLISHED TRADITIONS
A THIRD HIM THEY CONVICTED OF INSUBORDINATION AND SHUT UP IN PRISON
THE PRIESTS BEGIN TO REASON WITH HIM BUT THEIR EFFORTS IN CHRIST'S NAME TO PERSUADE HIM TO RENOUNCE CHRIST OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON HIM
ALL THESE MEN WHO WERE GOING TO MURDER OR TO TORTURE THE FAMISHING AND DEFENSELESS CREATURES WHO PROVIDE THEM THEIR SUSTENANCE HAD THE AIR OF MEN WHO KNEW VERY WELL THAT THEY WERE DOING THEIR DUTY AND SOME WERE EVEN PROUD WERE GLORYING IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING
ACCORDING TO ALL PRINCIPLES ACCORDING TO ALL I KNOW AND WHAT EVERYONE PROFESSES THE WORKMAN SAYS TO HIMSELF
THIS IS THE ATTITUDE OF ONE SET OF THINKERS
AND WHY IS IT SO INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY
WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE INCONSISTENCY THAT WE DO NOT SEE ALL THE HIDEOUS FOLLY AND IMMORALITY OF MEN VOLUNTARILY CHOOSING THE PROFESSION OF BUTCHERY AS THOUGH IT WERE AN HONORABLE CAREER OF POOR WRETCHES SUBMITTING TO CONSCRIPTION OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE COMPULSORY SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN INTRODUCED OF PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY ABANDONING A LIFE OF INDUSTRY TO RECRUIT SOLDIERS AND TRAIN THEM AS MURDERERS
IT HAS COME TO THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS
NOT ONE OF THESE OFFICERS WOULD CONSENT TO CHEAT AT CARDS WOULD REFUSE TO PAY A DEBT OF HONOR WOULD BETRAY A COMRADE RUN AWAY ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE OR DESERT THE FLAG
MEN WHO REFUSE AN EXTERNAL ASSENT TO THE FAITH AND SAY SO OPENLY ARE EITHER DIRECTLY PUNISHED OR DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTS
WITHIN--TO PUNISH THEM IS EQUIVALENT TO OPENLY RENOUNCING CHRISTIANITY AND ASSISTING IN DIFFUSING THE VERY PRINCIPLE BY WHICH THESE MEN JUSTIFY THEIR NON-COMPLIANCE--SO GOVERNMENTS ARE IN A HELPLESS POSITION--MEN WHO MAINTAIN THE USELESSNESS OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE ONLY RETARD THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PRESENT STATE ORGANIZATION BASED ON FORCE
CHRISTIANS DO NOT NEED GOVERNMENT AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT EITHER OBEY IT IN WHAT IS CONTRARY TO CHRIST'S TEACHING NOR STILL LESS TAKE PART IN IT CHRIST TOOK HIS DISCIPLES OUT OF THE WORLD HE SAYS
THEY CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THE LEADERS OF CIVILIZATION THE EDUCATED CLASSES COULD SO CONFIDENTLY PREACH TWO SUCH OPPOSED PRINCIPLES AS THE LAW OF CHRIST AND MURDER
SIGNIFICANCE OF COMPULSORY SERVICE VIII
IT IS LIKE THE SPRING THIS TIME OF TRANSITION WHEN THE OLD ORDER OF IDEAS HAS NOT QUITE BROKEN UP AND THE NEW HAS NOT QUITE GAINED A FOOTING
ONE NEED ONLY TALK TO THESE PEOPLE A LITTLE TO SEE THAT ALL OF THEM THE LANDOWNER EVEN AND THE JUDGE AND THE MINISTER AND THE TZAR AND THE GOVERNMENT THE OFFICERS AND THE SOLDIERS NOT ONLY DISAPPROVE OF SUCH THINGS IN THE DEPTH OF THEIR SOUL BUT SUFFER FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THEM WHEN THEY RECOLLECT WHAT THEY IMPLY
BUT TO SPEAK LIKE THIS IS JUST LIKE TELLING A MAN WHO IS STRUGGLING ON A SWIFT RIVER AND IS DIRECTING HIS COURSE AGAINST THE CURRENT THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE RIVER ROWING AGAINST THE CURRENT AND THAT TO CROSS IT HE MUST FLOAT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POINT HE WANTS TO REACH
AND WHETHER IT IS LAUDABLE AND WORTHY OF A MAN TO ROB HIS NEIGHBOR FOR HIS GRATIFICATION OF WHAT HE WANTS TO SATISFY HIS SIMPLEST NEEDS AS THE GREAT LANDOWNERS DO
AS FOR THOSE WHO PROFIT BY THE PRIVILEGES GAINED BY PREVIOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE THEY OFTEN FORGET AND LIKE TO FORGET HOW THESE PRIVILEGES WERE OBTAINED
ONE SET OF PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED ANOTHER SET HAVE PROPOSED A THIRD HAVE REPORTED A FOURTH HAVE DECIDED A FIFTH HAVE CONFIRMED A SIXTH HAVE GIVEN THE ORDER AND A SEVENTH SET OF MEN HAVE CARRIED IT OUT
AND IT HAS TOO A VALUE FOR ALL TIME DEALING WITH THE QUESTION HOW IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES PEOPLE SHOULD AND CAN REFUSE TO ENTER MILITARY SERVICE
BUT THERE ARE MEN WHO HOLD ON THE CONTRARY THAT AS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HUMANITY LIVED WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SUCH AN ORGANIZATION IS TEMPORARY AND THAT A TIME MUST COME WHEN MEN NEED A NEW ORGANIZATION AND THAT THAT TIME HAS COME NOW
CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MEN OF SCIENCE V
IN DISCUSSING MY BOOK AND THE GOSPEL TEACHING GENERALLY AS IT IS EXPRESSED IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT THE FOREIGN CRITICS MAINTAINED THAT SUCH DOCTRINE IS NOT PECULIARLY CHRISTIAN CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS EITHER CATHOLICISM OR PROTESTANTISM ACCORDING TO THEIR VIEWS)--THE TEACHING OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT IS ONLY A STRING OF VERY PRETTY IMPRACTICABLE DREAMS DU CHARMANT DOCTEUR AS RERAN SAYS FIT FOR THE SIMPLE AND HALF-SAVAGE INHABITANTS OF GALILEE WHO LIVED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND FOR THE HALF-SAVAGE RUSSIAN PEASANTS--SUTAEV AND BONDAREV--AND THE RUSSIAN MYSTIC TOLSTOY BUT NOT AT ALL CONSISTENT WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF EUROPEAN CULTURE
THAT THOSE ARE IN AUTHORITY WHO OUGHT TO BE IN AUTHORITY AND THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING APPEARS TO THEM A TRUTH OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
AND IN SAYING THIS THE SOLDIER OBVIOUSLY SET HIS MIND AT REST IN THE FULL CONVICTION THAT HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDES HAD FOUND A LAW WHICH AUTHORIZED HIS ANCESTORS AND THE TZARS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS AND MILLIONS OF MEN TO SERVE AS HE WAS DOING HIMSELF AND THAT THE QUESTION I HAD PUT HIM WAS A KIND OF HOAX OR CONUNDRUM ON MY PART
ALL THE YOUNG MEN THROUGH THE WHOLE OF EUROPE ARE EXPOSED YEAR AFTER YEAR TO THIS TEST AND WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS THEY RENOUNCE ALL THAT A MAN CAN HOLD SACRED ALL EXPRESS THEIR READINESS TO KILL THEIR BROTHERS EVEN THEIR FATHERS AT THE BIDDING OF THE FIRST CRAZY CREATURE DRESSED UP IN A LIVERY WITH RED AND GOLD TRIMMING AND ONLY WAIT TO BE TOLD WHERE AND WHEN THEY ARE TO KILL
I WILL LIVE AS BEFORE AND WILL NOT DECIDE THE QUESTION OF RESISTANCE OR NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
BUT THIS WILL NOT COME TO PASS AS SOME CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER IMAGINE THROUGH THE OPPRESSED BECOMING BETTER AND BETTER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GOVERNMENT ON THE CONTRARY ITS INFLUENCE CAUSES THEIR CONTINUAL DEGRADATION BUT THROUGH THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE CONSTANTLY GROWING BETTER AND BETTER OF THEMSELVES SO THAT EVEN THE MOST WICKED WHO ARE IN POWER WILL BECOME LESS AND LESS WICKED TILL AT LAST THEY ARE SO GOOD AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF USING VIOLENCE
NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN HEAR HIS VOICE IN THE STREETS
WE COME HERE UPON WHAT IN A LARGE PROPORTION OF CASES FORMS THE SOURCE OF THE GROSSEST ERRORS OF MANKIND
THE DEVICE CONSISTS IN REDUCING A DIRECT CONSCIOUS DENIAL OF A COMMAND TO A CASUAL BREACH OF IT
NOT WHAT I WILL BUT AS THOU WILT
AND YET ALL THE CHRISTIANS LIBERALS AND CULTIVATED PEOPLE FAR FROM RESENTING THIS OUTRAGE DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE IT
FORTRESSES ARSENALS AND SHIPS ARE BUILT NEW WEAPONS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING INVENTED TO BE REPLACED IN A SHORT TIME BY FRESH ONES FOR SAD TO SAY SCIENCE WHICH OUGHT ALWAYS TO BE AIMING AT THE GOOD OF HUMANITY ASSISTS IN THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION AND IS CONSTANTLY INVENTING NEW MEANS FOR KILLING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MEN IN THE SHORTEST TIME
THOSE WHO HAVE ANYTHING TO BE TAKEN HAVE THEIR PROPERTY TAKEN FROM THEM BY FORCE
CONSEQUENTLY THE POLICE DID NOT CARRY OUT THE ORDER
THE FASHIONABLE LADY HAD CERTAINLY NOT REASONED OUT THAT IF THERE WERE NO CAPITALISTS AND NO ARMY TO DEFEND THEM HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE NO FORTUNE AND SHE COULD NOT HAVE HER ENTERTAINMENTS AND HER BALL-DRESSES
AND AT ONCE WE SEE THE WHOLE OF THIS COMPLEX AND SEEMINGLY POWERFUL ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY FALLS INTO RUINS OF ITSELF WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
AND THEY TOO MAKE WAR TO GAIN BOOTY AND EVEN FOR HONOR
FOR WITHOUT IT THEY WOULD NOT ONLY BE UNABLE TO GAIN AN EQUAL POSITION BUT WOULD BE FOUND TO FALL LOWER THAN ALL OTHER PEOPLE

THEY ARE CERTAINLY FOR THE MOST PART GOOD KIND EVEN TENDER-HEARTED FELLOWS WHO HATE EVERY SORT OF CRUELTY NOT TO SPEAK OF MURDER
GARRISON THE WORK OF HIS SON
AND LET THOSE WHOSE LOT IT IS TO ACT THUS REMEMBER THAT THE FULFILLMENT OF A GREAT DUTY RESTS WITH THEM
I HAVE PROMISED LEAVING ALL ELSE TO FOLLOW GOOD AND THROUGH EVIL TO DEATH ITSELF
THAT IS TO SAY THAT NO PROGRESS WILL LEAD MEN TO RISE ABOVE THE SAVAGE CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH REGARDS NO PARTICIPATION OF BREAD MONEY MONEY IS GOOD IN THIS CONTEXT AND WOMAN POSSIBLE WITHOUT FIGHTING
XII
ASSERTIONS OF THIS KIND PROCEED FOR THE MOST PART FROM MEN WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANKS IN THE GOVERNING OR ECCLESIASTICAL HIERARCHY AND WHO ARE CONSEQUENTLY PERFECTLY ASSURED THAT NO ONE WILL DARE TO CONTRADICT THEIR ASSERTION AND THAT IF ANYONE DOES CONTRADICT IT THEY WILL HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONTRADICTION
LEAST OF ALL COULD ANYONE DREAM OF KILLING OR EXILING MEN FOR EXPOSING FALSEHOOD AND TELLING THE TRUTH
AND BEHOLD IF THE WITNESS BE A FALSE WITNESS AND HATH TESTIFIED FALSELY AGAINST HIS BROTHER THEN SHALL YE DO UNTO HIM AS HE HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE UNTO HIS BROTHER
SOME PEOPLE MAINTAIN THAT GOVERNMENT IS MORE NECESSARY FOR HUMANITY THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE STATE ORGANIZATION WOULD INVOLVE THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL THAT HUMANITY HAS GAINED THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN AND STILL IS THE ONLY FORM IN WHICH HUMANITY CAN DEVELOP
TO THE QUESTION WHEN THIS HOUR COMETH CHRIST ANSWERS THAT WE CANNOT KNOW BUT JUST BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHEN THAT HOUR IS COMING WE OUGHT TO BE ALWAYS READY TO MEET IT JUST AS THE MASTER OUGHT TO WATCH WHO GUARDS HIS HOUSE FROM THIEVES AS THE VIRGINS OUGHT TO WATCH WITH LAMPS ALIGHT FOR THE BRIDEGROOM
TO GIVE UP EVERY CONVENIENCE AND CHARM OF OUR EXISTENCE TO PREFER SAVAGE YOUTH TO THE SENILE DECAY OF CIVILIZATION TO PULL DOWN THE PALACE RAISED FOR US BY OUR ANCESTORS ONLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF HAVING A HAND IN THE FOUNDING OF A NEW HOUSE WHICH WILL DOUBTLESS BE BUILT LONG AFTER WE ARE GONE HERZEN VOL
WHAT HAS HE TO DO IN THE ARMY
THE LESS THE DOCTRINE WAS UNDERSTOOD THE MORE OBSCURE IT APPEARED AND THE MORE NECESSARY WERE EXTERNAL PROOFS OF ITS TRUTH
HERESY MAKES ITS APPEARANCE IN THE CHURCH
THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES
THE WOMEN KEEP THEIR TEARFUL EYES FIXED ON THE DOORS
THEY SAY TO HIM
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
WE WOULD BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST
THE MAN HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND A NEW INSTRUMENT OF VIOLENCE HAS BEEN CREATED
THE CHURCH IS A FREE ASSOCIATION
JOHN VII
THUS I KNOW THE CASE OF A SERGEANT-MAJOR WHO HAD BEEN BEATEN BY TWO PEASANTS DURING THE REPRESSION OF DISORDER AND HAD MADE A COMPLAINT
AND THEREFORE THE PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION OF THE PUBLICAN ZACCHEUS OF THE WOMAN THAT WAS A SINNER AND OF THE ROBBER ON THE CROSS IMPLIES A HIGHER DEGREE OF LIFE THAN THE STAGNANT RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE PHARISEE
I AM CONVINCED THAT A GENERAL DISARMAMENT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WOULD INVOLVE SOMETHING LIKE A MORAL DECADENCE WHICH WOULD SHOW ITSELF IN GENERAL FEEBLENESS AND WOULD HINDER THE PROGRESSIVE ADVANCEMENT OF HUMANITY
THE ATTITUDE OF THE FIRST SECTION OF THINKERS THOSE WHO SEE A WAY OUT OF WAR IN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC MEASURES IS WELL EXPRESSED IN THE REPORT OF THE LAST PEACE CONGRESS IN LONDON AND THE ARTICLES AND LETTERS UPON WAR THAT APPEARED IN NO
HOWEVER OFTEN TOLSOY INTERSPERSED QUOTED MATERIAL WITH HIS COMMENTARY AS WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE AUTHOR FARRAR I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEPARATE THESE FOR FEAR OF EDITING THE AUTHOR
WAR CONFRONTS US EVERYWHERE NOT ONLY WAR BETWEEN DIFFERENT RACES AND PEOPLES BUT WAR TOO IN PRIVATE AND FAMILY LIFE
NOT MANY DAYS AGO I SAW ONCE MORE THIS SHAMELESS DECEPTION BEING OPENLY PRACTICED AND ONCE MORE I MARVELED THAT IT COULD BE PRACTICED SO EASILY AND IMPUDENTLY
AND CAN WE TALK OF THE DANGER THREATENING US FROM THE WARRIORS OF DAHOMEY THE ZULUS AND SUCH WHO LIVE SO FAR AWAY AND ARE NOT DREAMING OF ATTACKING US AND FROM SOME THOUSANDS OF SWINDLERS THIEVES AND MURDERERS BRUTALIZED AND CORRUPTED BY OURSELVES WHOSE NUMBER IS IN NO WAY LESSENED BY ALL OUR SENTENCES PRISONS AND EXECUTIONS
TO THIS CATEGORY BELONGS MOLTKE WHOSE OPINION HAS BEEN QUOTED ABOVE BY MAUPASSANT AND THE MAJORITY OF MILITARY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN EDUCATED IN THIS CRUEL SUPERSTITION LIVE BY IT AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE OFTEN IN ALL SIMPLICITY CONVINCED THAT WAR IS NOT ONLY AN INEVITABLE BUT EVEN A NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL THING
FURTHER ON IN THE BOOK HE TREATS OF THE RELATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT TO THE NEW THE VALUE OF GOVERNMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE CHRISTIANS AND MAKES SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE AND THE ATTACKS MADE ON IT
AND WHAT IS THE USE OF CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF PRIVATE PERSONS WHEN IT CAN ONLY BE OF USE AS THE PROPERTY OF ALL
THERE IS ALWAYS THE SAME ACTIVITY DIRECTED TO CONCEALING THE REAL DUTIES OF CHRISTIANITY AND TO PUTTING IN THEIR PLACE AN EXTERNAL RESPECTABILITY AND CANT AS IT IS SO WELL DESCRIBED BY THE ENGLISH WHO ARE PECULIARLY OPPRESSED BY IT
BUT HOW IS IT TO BE REMEDIED
AND NOT A PROFESSIONAL EXECUTIONER WHO KILLS ONLY CONDEMNED CRIMINALS BUT ONE READY TO BUTCHER ANY INNOCENT MAN AT THE WORD OF COMMAND
AND THE DANGER OF DESTRUCTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE TOO THEY LEAVE JUST AS IT WAS
BUT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO PROVE WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS
IF THEY HAD BEEN FANATICS PROFESSING SOME PECULIAR BELIEF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN DISPROVING THE SUPERSTITIOUS ERRORS MIXED IN WITH THEIR RELIGION TO ATTACK ALSO THE TRUTH THEY ADVOCATE
THAT IS AN AFFAIR OF FREE CONTRACT
UNIVERSAL COMPULSORY SERVICE IS NOT A POLITICAL ACCIDENT BUT THE FURTHEST LIMIT OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE--ORIGIN OF AUTHORITY IN SOCIETY--BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS PHYSICAL VIOLENCE--TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM ITS ACTS OF VIOLENCE AUTHORITY NEEDS A SPECIAL ORGANIZATION--THE ARMY--AUTHORITY THAT IS VIOLENCE IS THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IS DESTROYING THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE--ATTITUDE OF AUTHORITY TO THE MASSES THAT IS ATTITUDE OF GOVERNMENT TO WORKING OPPRESSED CLASSES--GOVERNMENTS TRY TO FOSTER IN WORKING CLASSES THE IDEA THAT STATE FORCE IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND THEM FROM EXTERNAL ENEMIES--BUT THE ARMY IS PRINCIPALLY NEEDED TO PRESERVE GOVERNMENT FROM ITS OWN SUBJECTS--THE WORKING CLASSES--SPEECH OF M
ONE SAT AT A TABLE FINISHING HIS BOTTLE OF BEER ANOTHER STOOD AT THE BUFFET EATING A CAKE AND BRUSHING THE CRUMBS OFF HIS UNIFORM THREW DOWN HIS MONEY WITH A SELF-CONFIDENT AIR
CONCLUSION--REPENT YE FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND
SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS CORRECTED THE ERRORS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS AND GREW EVER NEARER AND NEARER TO A COMPREHENSION OF THE TRUE MEANING
IT IS JUST SO WITH THE PRESENT ORDER OF SOCIETY BASED ON FORCE
AND GOVERNMENTS WE MAY BE QUITE SURE EXPRESS THEIR SYMPATHY AND MAKE A SHOW OF ENCOURAGING THEM
THOUGH ALL DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT YET THE ADVANCED GUARD UNDERSTAND AND THE REST WILL FOLLOW THEM
AND WHAT IS MOST BEWILDERING IS THAT THE PEOPLE DO NOT RISE AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENTS
ALAS
SECONDLY HAND OVER A PART OF THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABORS FOR US TO DISPOSE OF--WE WILL USE THE MONEY TO KEEP YOU IN SLAVERY AND TO HINDER YOU FROM FORCIBLY OPPOSING OUR ORDERS
FIRST EMBRACING THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE ANIMAL VIEW OF LIFE
EVERY CONDITION ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE IS ONLY A PARTICULAR STAGE OF NO CONSEQUENCE IN ITSELF ON THE WAY TOWARD UNATTAINABLE PERFECTION AND THEREFORE IN ITSELF IT DOES NOT IMPLY A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE OF LIFE
AH IF ONLY PEOPLE COULD ELECT THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE GOVERNMENTS THE SOLDIERS AND THE MONEY--THEN THERE WOULD BE AN END TO MILITARY POLITICS NOW THERE ARE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS IN ALMOST THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND IN SPITE OF THAT WAR EXPENDITURES AND THE PREPARATIONS FOR WAR HAVE INCREASED TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS
THE NOVELIST HAS SHOWN IN THIS BOOK THE RELIGIOUS FERVOR AND SPIRITUAL INSIGHT OF THE PROPHET
PEOPLE WILL ASK PERHAPS
I MAY QUOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THE AMAZINGLY NAIVE AND COMIC DECLARATION OF THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES THE OPPRESSORS OF OTHER NATIONALITIES--THE POLES THE GERMANS OF THE BALTIC PROVINCES AND THE JEWS
ALL FORCE THEREFORE RESTS ON THESE MEN WHO CARRY OUT THE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THE MEN WHO SERVE IN THE POLICE OR THE ARMY ESPECIALLY THE ARMY FOR THE POLICE ONLY VENTURE TO DO THEIR WORK BECAUSE THE ARMY IS AT THEIR BACK
A RICH LANDOWNER--NOT ONLY IN RUSSIA BUT IN FRANCE ENGLAND GERMANY OR AMERICA--LIVES ON THE RENTS EXACTED
AND CHRISTIANITY AS THE LIVING FORCE HAS GAINED MORE AND MORE UPON THE EXTINCT JUDAISM AND HEATHENISM AND HAS GROWN CONTINUALLY CLEARER AND CLEARER AS IT FREED ITSELF FROM THE ADMIXTURE OF FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD OVERLAID IT
WHY SHOULD HE NOT LOVE HUMANITY
AND THE DOCTRINE THAT ASKS TOO MUCH AND REQUIRES WHAT CANNOT BE PERFORMED IS WORSE THAN THAT WHICH REQUIRES OF MEN WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THEIR POWERS THESE LEARNED INTERPRETERS OF CHRISTIANITY MAINTAIN REPEATING WHAT WAS LONG AGO ASSERTED AND COULD NOT BUT BE ASSERTED BY THOSE WHO CRUCIFIED THE TEACHER BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM--THE JEWS
WE KNOW THAT THE BEST OF US WILL BE CUT DOWN AND OUR WORK WILL BE DESTROYED IN EMBRYO
BUT THAT DOES NOT PROVE THAT IT ALONE OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN TRANSMUTED EXCLUDING ALL THE REST CAN BE THE SOLE TRUTH ADMITTING OF NO DOUBT
NOW ONE MIGHT VENTURE TO SUBSTITUTE THE WORD LABORERS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WOULD THEY SHOULD DO UNTO ME--THAT IS TO HELP TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION OF SLAVERY
AND HE WHO WILL NOT LEAVE FATHER OR MOTHER OR CHILDREN OR BROTHERS OR FIELDS OR HOUSE HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE
AND THEREFORE NO IMPROVEMENT IS POSSIBLE SO LONG AS MEN ARE HYPOCRITICAL AND HIDE THE TRUTH FROM THEMSELVES SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR UNION AND THEREFORE THEIR WELFARE IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN THE TRUTH AND DO NOT PUT THE RECOGNITION AND PROFESSION OF THE TRUTH REVEALED TO THEM HIGHER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE
TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE WORK OF MASSACRE THEIR HATRED IS KINDLED BY PERSUADING THEM THAT THEY ARE HATED
BUT THIS IS LIKE SAYING THAT IF THE SEED WERE RIPE IT OUGHT AT ONCE TO BRING FORTH STALLS FLOWER AND FRUIT
OF LATE AS THE COMBINATIONS OF LABORERS GAIN IN STRENGTH ONE HEARS MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY THE CRY RAISED FOR THE INCREASE OF THE ARMY THOUGH THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT THREATENED WITH ANY ATTACK FROM WITHOUT
THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THIS EXPENDITURE ON WAR AND PREPARATIONS FOR WAR IS A CONTINUALLY GROWING NATIONAL DEBT
ACCORDING TO THESE PEOPLE'S NOTIONS A CHRISTIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN THE LEAST BOUND TO BE GUIDED BY THE SPIRIT OF PEACE FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES AND LOVE FOR ENEMIES
ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSAL RULE AND ESTABLISHED ORDER IT IS REQUIRED THAT ALL THE SUBJECTS SHOULD TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
WE ALL KNOW AND CANNOT HELP KNOWING--EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD THE IDEA CLEARLY EXPRESSED MAY NEVER HAVE READ OF IT AND MAY NEVER HAVE PUT IT INTO WORDS STILL THROUGH UNCONSCIOUSLY IMBIBING THE CHRISTIAN SENTIMENTS THAT ARE IN THE AIR--WITH OUR WHOLE HEART WE KNOW AND CANNOT ESCAPE KNOWING THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE ALL SONS OF ONE FATHER WHEREVER WE MAY LIVE AND WHATEVER LANGUAGE WE MAY SPEAK
YET THE CULTIVATED AND ADVANCED MEN OF THE DAY SEEM NOT TO SEE IT
IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT THE POWERS THAT BE IN ANY NATION ARE ACTUATED BY THE SPIRIT OR GUIDED BY THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST IN THE TREATMENT OF ENEMIES
EVEN THAT THE MINISTER WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO FORM THIS DECISION OR THE TZAR TO RATIFY IT
THE TIME WILL COME AND IS INEVITABLY COMING WHEN ALL INSTITUTIONS BASED ON FORCE WILL DISAPPEAR THROUGH THEIR USELESSNESS STUPIDITY AND EVEN INCONVENIENCE BECOMING OBVIOUS TO ALL
THE HIGHEST HAPPINESS FOR HIM IS THE FULLEST SATISFACTION OF HIS DESIRES
IN ALL MILITARY INSTRUCTIONS THERE APPEARS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER WHAT IS EXPRESSED IN THE RUSSIAN MILITARY CODE IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
THE QUESTION OF RESISTANCE OR NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL AROSE WHEN THE FIRST CONFLICT BETWEEN MEN TOOK PLACE SINCE EVERY CONFLICT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN RESISTANCE BY FORCE TO WHAT EACH OF THE COMBATANTS REGARDS AS EVIL
THE LIBERTY OF MAN DOES NOT CONSIST IN THE POWER OF ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PROGRESS OF LIFE AND THE INFLUENCES ARISING FROM IT BUT IN THE CAPACITY FOR RECOGNIZING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRUTH REVEALED TO HIM AND BECOMING THE FREE AND JOYFUL PARTICIPATOR IN THE ETERNAL AND INFINITE WORK OF GOD THE LIFE OF THE WORLD
ALL CITIZENS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS ARE FORCED TO SPEND SOME YEARS IN BARRACKS
THE IDEAL IS TO LOVE THE ENEMIES WHO HATE US
AND THIS IS JUST WHAT DOES HAPPEN AND ESPECIALLY OFTEN AMONG MILITARY MEN
THERE ARE MEN WHO MAINTAIN THAT THE LOVE FOR PEACE AND THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR FORM A HIDEOUS CONTRADICTION AND THAT SUCH IS THE FATE OF MAN
PRECISELY AS IT WAS WITH ALL THE PREACHING OF THE QUAKERS FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS AND TOO WITH THE EFFORTS OF GARRISON THE FATHER THE FOUNDATION OF HIS SOCIETY AND JOURNAL AND HIS DECLARATION SO IT IS WITH THE LIFE-WORK OF BALLOU
ONLY GATHER THE PEOPLE TOGETHER ON A LARGE SCALE AND A BATTLE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN BECOMES AN INNOCENT ACTION
THE FACT THAT AMONG CERTAIN NATIONS AS THE ENGLISH AND THE AMERICAN MILITARY SERVICE IS NOT COMPULSORY THOUGH ALREADY ONE HEARS THERE ARE SOME WHO ADVOCATE THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE SO DOES NOT AFFECT THE SERVILITY OF THE CITIZENS TO THE GOVERNMENT IN PRINCIPLE
THEY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE CERTAINTY OF PEACE--I DO NOT SAY PEACE I SAY THE CERTAINTY OF PEACE--WOULD IN HALF A CENTURY ENGENDER A CORRUPTION AND A DECADENCE MORE DESTRUCTIVE FOR MANKIND THAN THE WORST OF WARS
THAT IS WHY THAT POWER CANNOT REQUIRE OF US WHAT IS IRRATIONAL AND IMPOSSIBLE
WE DESTROY THE POSSIBILITY OF ANYTHING LIKE A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION AND STUDIOUSLY TRY TO SUPPRESS WHAT CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION IS EXISTING
CAN HE VOLUNTARILY GIVE MONEY TO AID A GOVERNMENT RESTING ON MILITARY FORCE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND VIOLENCE IN GENERAL
THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY NOT FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM
THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY NOT FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM
AND IT OFTEN HAPPENS THERE WAS A CASE INDEED WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT WHEN CALLED UPON TO QUELL DISTURBANCES THEY REFUSE TO FIRE UPON THE PEOPLE
IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT THE INVENTION OF TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION WILL PUT AN END TO WAR
READ ALL THE THEOLOGICAL WORKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
EVERY STEP FORWARD TOWARD THE MORAL PERFECTION OF HUMANITY IS ALWAYS GUIDED BY MEN WHO SEE NOTHING BUT THEIR VOCATION
MANY EARNEST THINKERS WHO LIKE TOLSTOI ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF THE CONTRADICTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER WILL HAIL HIM AS THEIR SPIRITUAL GUIDE
WE ARE BUT THE TOOLS OF THAT AUTOCRATIC ABSTRACTION THE STATE WHICH ENSLAVES EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE NAME OF THE WILL OF ALL WHO WOULD ALL TAKEN INDIVIDUALLY DESIRE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY WILL BE MADE TO DO
AND DIRECTLY ONE STATE ADOPTED IT THE OTHERS WERE OBLIGED TO DO THE SAME
ONE NEED NOT AIM AT VIRGINITY BUT ONE MUST AVOID DEBAUCHERY
AND THEREFORE THE CHRISTIAN WHO IS SUBJECT ONLY TO THE INNER DIVINE LAW NOT ONLY CANNOT CARRY OUT THE ENACTMENTS OF THE EXTERNAL LAW WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE DIVINE LAW OF LOVE WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGES AS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH STATE OBLIGATIONS HE CANNOT EVEN RECOGNIZE THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING WHATEVER HE CANNOT RECOGNIZE THE DUTY OF WHAT IS CALLED ALLEGIANCE
CHRISTIANITY IS MUCH BETTER WITHOUT IT THEY THINK NOT OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT CHRISTIANITY AS REPRESENTED BY THEM AMOUNTS TO
ONE IS THE RESULT OF THE OTHER
THAT WILL NOT HINDER ME FROM BEING A CHRISTIAN
IT IS NOT A LITTLE THING TO CUT ONE'S SELF OFF FROM ALL TO WHICH A MAN HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED FROM HIS BIRTH WITH WHICH HE HAS GROWN UP TO MATURITY
WE OUGHT TO OPPOSE EVIL BY EVERY RIGHTEOUS MEANS IN OUR POWER BUT NOT BY EVIL
BUT HOWEVER POWER HAS BEEN GAINED THOSE WHO POSSESS IT ARE IN NO WAY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN AND THEREFORE NO MORE DISPOSED THAN OTHERS TO SUBORDINATE THEIR OWN INTERESTS TO THOSE OF THE SOCIETY
SEEMS TO ADMIT THAT THIS INCONSISTENCY MUST EXIST AND THAT IT IS THE POETIC TRAGEDY OF LIFE
OUR COUNTRY IS THE WORLD OUR COUNTRYMEN ARE ALL MANKIND
YET MEN OF WHAT IS FALSELY CALLED SCIENCE PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC MEN LOOKING AT IT ONLY IN ITS EXTERNALS REGARD IT AS SOMETHING OUTGROWN AND HAVING NO VALUE FOR US
ONE REPRESENTS PRIDE VIOLENCE SELF-ASSERTION STAGNATION AND DEATH
AND SO IT HAS BEEN AND STILL IS IN FACT IN CERTAIN GROUPS THE DISTINCTION BEING THAT THEY ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE FORMS OF ASSOCIATION IN THE FAMILY OR TRIBE OR RACE OR EVEN IN THE PATRIARCHAL STATE
I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY DONE BY THE CLERGY THROUGH THE WIDE EXPANSE OF THE RUSSIAN LAND AMONG A PEOPLE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS
AND 2 BY INSTILLING INTO CERTAIN OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EITHER VOLUNTARILY ENLISTED OR BEEN TAKEN BY COMPULSION INTO THE ARMY THE IDEA THAT THE PERPETRATION OF MURDER AND TORTURE WITH THEIR OWN HANDS IS A SACRED DUTY AND EVEN A GLORIOUS EXPLOIT WORTHY OF PRAISE AND REWARD
THE SPECTATORS EVEN WHO TOOK NO PART IN THE AFFAIR HOW COULD THEY WHO ARE INDIGNANT AT THE SIGHT OF ANY CRUELTY IN PRIVATE LIFE EVEN THE OVERTAXING OF A HORSE ALLOW SUCH A HORRIBLE DEED TO BE PERPETRATED
ALL EFFORT AFTER A LIVING COMPREHENSION OF THE DOCTRINE HAS BEEN MADE BY HERETICS
DE VOGUE FINDS THE NECESSITY FOR WAR ACCORDING TO HIS VIEWS WELL EXPRESSED BY THE TWO GREAT WRITERS JOSEPH DE MAISTRE AND DARWIN WHOSE STATEMENTS HE LIKES SO MUCH THAT HE QUOTES THEM AGAIN
I KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE MEN WILL CONFIDENTLY TRY TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE REASONS FOR REGARDING THEIR POSITION AS LEGITIMATE AND QUITE INDISPENSABLE
THEY WILL GO LIKE SHEEP TO THE SLAUGHTER KNOWING ALL THE WHILE WHERE THEY ARE GOING KNOWING THAT THEY ARE LEAVING THEIR WIVES KNOWING THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL WANT FOR FOOD FULL OF MISGIVINGS YET INTOXICATED BY THE FINE-SOUNDING LIES THAT ARE DINNED INTO THEIR EARS
IT MAKES THE IMPARTIAL AUTHOR OF OUR EXISTENCE UNEQUAL AND TYRANNICAL
EVEN AT THAT TIME MEN HAD BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND THAT HUMAN LAWS THOUGH GIVEN OUT FOR DIVINE LAWS WERE COMPILED BY MEN AND CANNOT BE INFALLIBLE WHATEVER THE EXTERNAL MAJESTY WITH WHICH THEY ARE INVESTED AND THAT ERRING MEN ARE NOT RENDERED INFALLIBLE BY ASSEMBLING TOGETHER AND CALLING THEMSELVES A SENATE OR ANY OTHER NAME
THESE ARE NOT THE SOLDIERS OF FORMER DAYS WHO GAVE UP THE NATURAL LIFE OF INDUSTRY AND DEVOTED THEIR WHOLE EXISTENCE TO DEBAUCHERY PLUNDER AND MURDER LIKE THE ROMAN LEGIONARIES OR THE WARRIORS OF THE THIRTY YEARS WAR OR EVEN THE SOLDIERS OF MORE RECENT TIMES WHO SERVED FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS IN THE ARMY
THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH WHATEVER IT MAY BE--CATHOLIC ANGLICAN LUTHERAN PRESBYTERIAN--EVERY CHURCH IN SO FAR AS IT IS A CHURCH CANNOT BUT STRIVE FOR THE SAME OBJECT AS THE RUSSIAN CHURCH
FOR TO REMOVE THE HEADS OF A GOVERNMENT RULING BY FORCE IT IS NOT THE RIGHT ALONE BUT THE POWER TO DO SO THAT IS NEEDED
BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE GIVE IT UP AND TRUST OURSELVES TO SOMETHING INVISIBLE AND INTANGIBLE AND ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN THE UNKNOWN WORLD ON WHICH THEY ARE ENTERING IN RENOUNCING THEIR HABITUAL WAYS OF LIFE APPEARS ITSELF AS DREADFUL TO THEM
WHY SHOULD I FLOG MYSELF
WHICHEVER OF THESE PARTIES WERE SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING THEIR SCHEMES TO PASS MUST RESORT TO SUPPORT ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL THE EXISTING METHODS OF VIOLENCE AND EVEN INVENT NEW ONES
BUT WHEN A CERTAIN POINT IN THE DIFFUSION OF THE TRUTH HAS BEEN REACHED IT IS SUDDENLY ASSIMILATED BY EVERYONE NOT BY THE INNER WAY BUT AS IT WERE INVOLUNTARILY
WE STRUGGLE AGAINST NATURE AND IGNORANCE AND OBSTACLES OF ALL KINDS TO MAKE OUR WRETCHED LIFE LESS HARD
AND WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL--THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN SALVATION THROUGH FAITH IN THE REDEMPTION OR THE SACRAMENTS CANNOT DEVOTE ALL HIS POWERS TO REALIZING CHRIST'S MORAL TEACHING IN HIS LIFE
HERE IS WHAT HE SAYS IN HIS INTRODUCTION P
LIKE THAT OF HYPNOTIZED SUBJECTS ACTING BY SUGGESTION--THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS OBEDIENCE TO GOVERNMENT SUGGESTION AND OBEDIENCE TO PUBLIC OPINION AND TO THE GUIDANCE OF MEN OF A HIGHER MORAL SENSE--THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY WHICH IS THE RESULT OF AN EXTINCT PUBLIC OPINION AND IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE ALREADY EXISTING PUBLIC OPINION OF THE FUTURE IS ONLY MAINTAINED BY THE STUPEFACTION OF THE CONSCIENCE PRODUCED SPONTANEOUSLY BY SELF-INTEREST IN THE UPPER CLASSES AND THROUGH HYPNOTIZING IN THE LOWER CLASSES--THE CONSCIENCE OR THE COMMON SENSE OF SUCH MEN MAY AWAKEN AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF ITS SUDDEN AWAKENING SO THAT ONE CAN NEVER BE SURE OF THE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE THEY ARE PREPARED FOR--IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE POINT WHICH THE SENSE OF THE UNLAWFULNESS OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE HAS REACHED AND THIS SENSE MAY SPONTANEOUSLY AWAKEN IN MEN OR MAY BE REAWAKENED BY THE INFLUENCE OF MEN OF MORE CONSCIENCE
BUT YOU WILL SAY THAT THERE IS THE PUBLIC GOOD TO BE CONSIDERED AND THAT ON THAT ACCOUNT ONE MUST NOT AND OUGHT NOT TO CONFORM TO THESE PRINCIPLES
THAT IS JUST WHAT THE MAN OF THE SOCIAL THEORY OF LIFE IS PASSING THROUGH NOW
BESIDES THE FACT THAT MEN GET RID OF THE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN THIS WAY THEY LOSE THEIR MORAL SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY ALSO BY THE FACT THAT IN FORMING THEMSELVES INTO A STATE ORGANIZATION THEY PERSUADE THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER SO CONTINUALLY AND SO INDEFATIGABLY THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL EQUAL BUT AS THE STARS APART THAT THEY COME TO BELIEVE IT GENUINELY THEMSELVES
A RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO THE CHAIRMAN THE SECRETARIES AND THE MEMBERS OF THE BUREAU OF THE CONGRESS
TOLSTOI
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT CHRIST FORBADE MURDER PAY NO HEED TO THE ARGUMENTS NOR TO THE COMMANDS OF THOSE WHO CALL ON YOU TO BEAR A HAND IN IT
SO THAT THOUGH MAN MAY NOT BE FREE AS REGARDS THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS ACTIONS HE IS FREE AS REGARDS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH THEY ARE PERFORMED
AND IT CAN ONLY BE FREELY ASSIMILATED IN TWO WAYS
THE ANIMAL EXISTENCE OF A MAN DOES NOT CONSTITUTE HUMAN LIFE ALONE
THE DOCTORS EXAMINE HIM INTEREST THEMSELVES WARMLY IN HIS CASE AND NATURALLY FINDING IN HIM NO SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL DISEASE SEND HIM BACK TO THE ARMY
BUT YET IT IS JUST THOSE INCIDENTS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL UNDERMINE THE POWER OF THE STATE AND PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE FREEDOM OF MEN
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT WE MODERN MEN WITH THE CHRISTIAN SENSE OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND EQUALITY PERMEATING US SOUL AND BODY WITH OUR NEED FOR PEACEFUL ASSOCIATION AND UNITY BETWEEN NATIONS SHOULD REALLY GO ON LIVING IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVERY JOY EVERY GRATIFICATION WE HAVE IS BOUGHT BY THE SUFFERINGS BY THE LIVES OF OUR BROTHER MEN AND MOREOVER THAT WE SHOULD BE EVERY INSTANT WITHIN A HAIR'S-BREADTH OF FALLING ON ONE ANOTHER NATION AGAINST NATION LIKE WILD BEASTS MERCILESSLY DESTROYING MEN'S LIVES AND LABOR ONLY BECAUSE SOME BENIGHTED DIPLOMATIST OR RULER SAYS OR WRITES SOME STUPIDITY TO ANOTHER EQUALLY BENIGHTED DIPLOMATIST OR RULER
UNIVERSAL SERVICE IS THE EXTREME LIMIT OF VIOLENCE NECESSARY FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE STATE ORGANIZATION AND IT IS THE EXTREME LIMIT TO WHICH SUBMISSION ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECTS CAN GO
THE WORSE ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY GAINING POSSESSION OF POWER UNDER THE SOBERING INFLUENCE WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES POWER GROW LESS AND LESS CRUEL AND BECOME INCAPABLE OF USING CRUEL FORMS OF VIOLENCE
IF I AM UNLUCKY I MAY IN ADDITION BE SENT TO WAR WHERE I SHALL BE FORCED TO KILL MEN OF FOREIGN NATIONS WHO HAVE DONE ME NO HARM WHERE I MAY BE MAIMED OR KILLED OR SENT TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AS IN THE CASE OF THE GARRISON OF SEVASTOPOL AND OTHER CASES IN EVERY WAR OR WHAT WOULD BE MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL I MAY BE SENT AGAINST MY OWN COMPATRIOTS AND HAVE TO KILL MY OWN BROTHERS FOR SOME DYNASTIC OR OTHER STATE INTERESTS WHICH HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
THEY SEEM TO THINK THERE IS NO COURSE OPEN BUT SLAVISH SUBMISSION
I SAY UNTO YOU IS WRITTEN IN THE GOSPEL RESIST NOT EVIL DO NOT OPPOSE INJURY WITH INJURY BUT RATHER BEAR REPEATED INJURY FROM THE EVIL DOER
BUT IF YOU CANNOT BEAR TO LIVE IN EVERLASTING DISSONANCE BETWEEN YOUR BELIEFS AND YOUR LIFE THINKING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER GET OUT OF THE MEDIAEVAL WHITED SEPULCHERS AND FACE YOUR FEARS
THE CHURCHES ARE PLACED IN A DILEMMA
THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN DIFFERENT FORMS IS APPLIED UNDER THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION IN THE PERPETRATION OF THE CRIMES WITHOUT WHICH NO GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COULD EXIST
ALL STATE OBLIGATIONS PAYMENT OF TAXES FULFILLMENT OF STATE DUTIES AND SUBMISSION TO PUNISHMENTS EXILE FINES ETC TO WHICH PEOPLE APPEAR TO SUBMIT VOLUNTARILY ARE ALWAYS BASED ON BODILY VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT OF IT
IT CANNOT BE
I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND--I KILL THE RUFFIAN AND SAVE THE GIRL
AND AT ALL TIMES AND PLACES STICKING AT NOTHING IN ALL DEPARTMENTS SUPPORT BY WORD AND DEED THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT ON WHICH THEIR OWN PROSPERITY ALSO RESTS
THESE MANIFESTATIONS WILL BE DIFFERENT HIGHER BETTER BUT THEY WILL NOT CEASE TO BE
LET THEM HAVE A LESSON
THEY HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT IN TAVERNS
THE CHRISTIAN IS INDEPENDENT OF EVERY HUMAN AUTHORITY BY THE FACT THAT HE REGARDS THE DIVINE LAW OF LOVE IMPLANTED IN THE SOUL OF EVERY MAN AND BROUGHT BEFORE HIS CONSCIOUSNESS BY CHRIST AS THE SOLE GUIDE OF HIS LIFE AND OTHER MEN'S ALSO
YES BUT WHAT IS ONE TO DO PEOPLE OFTEN ASK IN GENUINE PERPLEXITY
NOT ONE OF THESE OFFICIALS WOULD STEAL A PURSE READ ANOTHER MAN'S LETTER OR PUT UP WITH AN AFFRONT WITHOUT DEMANDING SATISFACTION
AND THEREFORE FOR THIS RELIGION THERE CANNOT BE RULES WHICH IT IS OBLIGATORY TO OBEY
THEY ARE KNOWN BY EVERYONE FOR GOOD GENTLE PEACEABLE PEOPLE AND THEY CANNOT BE REGARDED AS CRIMINALS WHO MUST BE REMOVED FOR THE SAFETY OF SOCIETY
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN PUT THIS QUESTION TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING IT IS THE FACT THAT BISHOPS METROPOLITANS AND ALL MEN IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY KISS THE RELICS AND WONDER-WORKING IKONS
SOMETIMES THEY REALIZE IT ONLY AFTER THE CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED SOMETIMES THEY REALIZE IT JUST BEFORE ITS PERPETRATION
THE THIRD METHOD IS WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS HYPNOTIZING THE PEOPLE
SINCE I CANNOT IMAGINE A SOCIETY MORE DETESTABLE THAN OURS I FEEL MORE SKEPTICAL THAN ALARMED IN REGARD TO THAT WHICH WILL REPLACE IT
THE UNDEFINED IF NOT DISINGENUOUS ATTITUDE OF MODERN THINKERS TO THIS PHENOMENON IS STRIKING
THE OPPRESSORS EVEN IF THEY WISHED TO DO SO COULD NOT MAKE AN END TO OPPRESSION
A MANUFACTURER IS A MAN WHOSE WHOLE INCOME CONSISTS OF VALUE SQUEEZED OUT OF THE WORKMEN AND WHOSE WHOLE OCCUPATION IS BASED ON FORCED UNNATURAL LABOR EXHAUSTING WHOLE GENERATIONS OF MEN
THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WILL EMANCIPATE MEN FROM THE MISERIES OF OUR PAGAN LIFE
ALL THIS IS REGARDED AS FAITH OBLIGATORY ON EVERYONE
SO THAT WHETHER GOVERNMENTAL VIOLENCE IS SUPPRESSED OR NOT THE POSITION OF GOOD MEN IN BEING OPPRESSED BY THE WICKED WILL BE UNCHANGED
THERE IS THE SAME DIVISION OF OPPRESSORS AND OPPRESSED BUT THEIR VIEW OF THE SIGNIFICANCE AND DIGNITY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS IS NO LONGER WHAT IT ONCE WAS
BUT THE PROPOSITION THAT CHRIST WAS GOD HAD TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES COMPLETELY BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION
THAT IS THAT THE GOOD ALWAYS RULE AND THAT DIRECTLY THOSE AT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT CEASE TO BE BETTER THAN THOSE THEY RULE OVER THE CITIZENS ARE BOUND TO REMOVE THEM
BUT SINCE COMMERCIAL AND BANKING OPERATIONS CONSIST IN NOTHING BUT SELLING FOR MORE THAN THE COST PRICE THIS WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO AN INVITATION TO SUPPRESS THEMSELVES
AND MANY WHO ARE NOT EQUAL TO PARTING WITH THEIR WEALTH IN THEIR LIFETIME LEAVE IT IN THEIR WILLS TO PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
AND IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE SINCE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE ARMY AND THE STATE IS BASED IN REALITY ON THIS DELUSIVE EMANCIPATION OF MEN FROM THEIR DUTY TO GOD AND THEIR CONSCIENCE AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF DUTY TO THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICER FOR ALL OTHER DUTIES
AT THE LAST MOMENT THEY WILL ALL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF A HYPNOTIZED MAN TO WHOM IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO CHOP A LOG WHO COMING UP TO WHAT HAS BEEN INDICATED TO HIM AS A LOG WITH THE AX ALREADY LIFTED TO STRIKE SEES THAT IT IS NOT A LOG BUT HIS SLEEPING BROTHER
AND THEY SEE THE PLACE AND TIME APPROACHING WITH UNTROUBLED SERENITY
THEY REFUSE TO PERFORM POLICE DUTIES BECAUSE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DUTIES THEY MUST USE FORCE AGAINST THEIR BROTHERS AND ILL TREAT THEM AND A CHRISTIAN CANNOT DO THAT
BUT DO NOT YE AFTER THEIR WORKS
SUCH HAS BEEN AND STILL IS THE CONDITION OF ALL THE OPPRESSED BUT HITHERTO THEY HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED THE FACT
AND CHRIST AT ONCE REPROVED HIM FOR THIS SAYING THAT HE WHO TAKES UP THE SWORD SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD
MEN WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF POWER AND WEALTH SOMETIMES EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE GAINED FOR THEMSELVES THEIR POWER AND WEALTH BUT MORE OFTEN THEIR HEIRS CEASE TO BE SO EAGER FOR POWER AND SO CRUEL IN THEIR EFFORTS TO OBTAIN IT
THE DIVINE PERFECTION IS THE ASYMPTOTE OF HUMAN LIFE TO WHICH IT IS ALWAYS STRIVING AND ALWAYS APPROACHING THOUGH IT CAN ONLY BE REACHED IN INFINITY
ASKS A LEARNED WRITER IN THE REVUE DES REVUES
IN THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE POSITIVISTS AND ALL THE THEORIZERS ABOUT UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD ON NON-CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES
IN SUBMITTING THEY SIMPLY YIELD TO THE SUGGESTIONS GIVEN THEM AS ORDERS WITHOUT THOUGHT OR EFFORT OF WILL
WARRIORS ARE THE SCOURGE OF THE WORLD
SINCE UBI CHRISTUS IBI ECCLESIA THEN CHRISTUS IS WHERE WE ARE
BUT APART FROM ITS INTEREST FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW IT IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PRODUCTS OF THOUGHT FOR ITS DEPTH OF AIM FOR THE ASTOUNDING STRENGTH AND BEAUTY OF THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN AND FOR ITS ANTIQUITY
THOUGH EXPRESSING THE MOTIVES OF THEIR CONDUCT DIFFERENTLY BOTH THOSE IN COMMAND AND THEIR SUBORDINATES ARE AGREED IN SAYING THAT THEY ACT THUS BECAUSE THE EXISTING ORDER IS THE ORDER WHICH MUST AND OUGHT TO EXIST AT THE PRESENT TIME AND THAT THEREFORE TO SUPPORT IT IS THE SACRED DUTY OF EVERY MAN
CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A SYSTEM OF RULES BUT A NEW CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND THEREFORE IT WAS NOT OBLIGATORY AND WAS NOT ACCEPTED IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE BY ALL BUT ONLY BY A FEW--CHRISTIANITY IS MOREOVER PROPHETIC OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PAGAN LIFE AND THEREFORE OF NECESSITY OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES--NON-RESISTANCE OF EVIL BY FORCE IS ONE ASPECT OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE WHICH MUST INEVITABLY IN OUR TIMES BE ACCEPTED BY MEN--TWO METHODS OF DECIDING EVERY QUARREL--FIRST METHOD IS TO FIND A UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF EVIL WHICH ALL MUST ACCEPT AND TO RESIST THIS EVIL BY FORCE--SECOND METHOD IS THE CHRISTIAN ONE OF COMPLETE NON-RESISTANCE BY FORCE--THOUGH THE FAILURE OF THE FIRST METHOD WAS RECOGNIZED SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF CHRISTIANITY IT WAS STILL PROPOSED AND ONLY AS MANKIND HAS PROGRESSED IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF EVIL--THIS IS RECOGNIZED BY ALL AT THE PRESENT DAY AND IF FORCE IS STILL USED TO
THIRDLY ELECT OTHERS OR BE YOURSELF ELECTED TO TAKE A PRETENDED SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT KNOWING ALL THE WHILE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROCEED QUITE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE FOOLISH SPEECHES YOU AND THOSE LIKE YOU MAY UTTER AND KNOWING THAT ITS PROCEEDINGS WILL BE ACCORDING TO OUR WILL THE WILL OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE ARMY IN THEIR HANDS
IT IS THE SAME WITH JUDGES AND PUBLIC PROSECUTORS
EVERY NEW TRUTH BY WHICH THE ORDER OF HUMAN LIFE IS CHANGED AND HUMANITY IS ADVANCED IS AT FIRST ACCEPTED BY ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF MEN WHO UNDERSTAND IT THROUGH INNER SPIRITUAL INTUITION
AND ASK HIM WHETHER IT IS LAUDABLE AND WORTHY OF A MAN AND SUITABLE FOR A CHRISTIAN TO EMPLOY HIMSELF FOR A SALARY IN SEIZING WRETCHED MISGUIDED OFTEN ILLITERATE AND DRUNKEN CREATURES BECAUSE THEY APPROPRIATE THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS--ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THAN WE DO--OR BECAUSE THEY KILL MEN IN A DIFFERENT FASHION FROM THAT IN WHICH WE UNDERTAKE TO DO IT--AND SHUTTING THEM IN PRISON FOR IT ILL TREATING THEM AND KILLING THEM
THE DISTRICT COMMANDER MADE OUT AN ORDER THAT FROM EVERY HOUSE THROUGHOUT THE VILLAGE ONE WOMAN WAS TO BE TAKEN AND PUT IN PRISON
BUT CHRIST COULD NOT HAVE FOUNDED THE CHURCH THAT IS WHAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND BY THAT WORD
THEY EITHER SEND HIM TO THE FRONTIER OR PROVOKE HIM TO INSUBORDINATION AND THEN TRY HIM FOR BREACH OF DISCIPLINE AND SHUT HIM UP IN THE PRISON OF THE DISCIPLINARY BATTALION WHERE THEY CAN ILL TREAT HIM FREELY UNSEEN BY ANYONE OR THEY DECLARE HIM MAD AND LOCK HIM UP IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM
AND WHEN ONCE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES THESE QUESTIONS THEY CANNOT HELP COMING TO SOME DECISION AND CEASING TO SUPPORT ALL THESE INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE
WE WHOSE SOCIAL EXISTENCE BEATS WITH ONE COMMON PULSE--WE AID ONE ANOTHER LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER DRAW EVER CLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER TO OUR MUTUAL HAPPINESS AND FIND IN THIS CLOSENESS THE WHOLE MEANING OF LIFE!--AND TO-MORROW SOME CRAZY RULER WILL SAY SOME STUPIDITY AND ANOTHER WILL ANSWER IN THE SAME SPIRIT AND THEN I MUST GO EXPOSE MYSELF TO BEING MURDERED AND MURDER MEN--WHO HAVE DONE ME NO HARM--AND MORE THAN THAT WHOM I LOVE
ALL PEASANTS ARE BOUND TO FILL CERTAIN POLICE OFFICES--THAT OF VILLAGE CONSTABLE AND OF WATCHMAN AND SO ON
BEFORE CHRIST'S TEACHING IT SEEMED TO MEN THAT THE ONE ONLY MEANS OF SETTLING A DISPUTE WAS BY RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THEY INQUIRED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THEIR IDEAS CANNOT DO WRONG SENDS THE ARMY TO WAR AND ORDERS CRIMINALS TO BE EXECUTED WHEN I ANSWERED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES WRONG IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS THE PEASANTS FELL INTO STILL GREATER CONFUSION AND EITHER BROKE OFF THE CONVERSATION OR ELSE GOT ANGRY WITH ME
BUT IN REALITY THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS LOVE IS DESTROYED BY THE NECESSITY OF EXTENDING ITS OBJECT INDEFINITELY
AND THEREFORE IT IS ESSENTIALLY A PART OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION TO MAKE DEMANDS HIGHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSED IN ITS PRECEPTS
AND LASTLY I WILL SPEAK OF THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY ALL THIS IN THE LIGHT OF THE HISTORICAL EVENTS OF LATE YEARS
BUT THAT DAY WILL NEVER COME FOOTNOTE
AND THIS FEELING INCREASED AS THEY DREW NEAR THE SCENE OF ACTION
IT DESTROYS AND IN THE END EXTIRPATES THE EVIL FEELING
TOLSTOY HE SAYS REJECTS THE INSPIRATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
GOVERNMENTS TOO KNOW VERY WELL THE DIFFICULTY AND THE BURDENSOMENESS OF RAISING AND MAINTAINING FORCES AND IF IN SPITE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE THEY DO AT THE COST OF TERRIBLE STRAIN AND EFFORT RAISE AND MAINTAIN FORCES IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY CANNOT DO OTHERWISE AND THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONGRESS CAN NEVER CHANGE IT
BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND ALWAYS IS DONE TO HIM
SO THEN WE HAVE ON ONE SIDE MEN CALLING THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS AND PROFESSING THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY AND ALONG WITH THAT READY IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY TO SUBMIT TO THE MOST SLAVISH DEGRADATION
AND THESE INCONSISTENCIES ARE NOT AS IT MIGHT SEEM BECAUSE MEN PRETEND TO BE CHRISTIANS WHILE THEY ARE REALLY PAGANS BUT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING LACKING IN MEN OR SOME KIND OF FORCE HINDERING THEM FROM BEING WHAT THEY ALREADY FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE IN THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHAT THEY GENUINELY WISH TO BE
WOE TO HIM THAT OFFENDETH ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONES FROM THE VERY FIRST AWAKENING OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE CHILD THEY BEGIN TO DECEIVE HIM TO INSTILL INTO HIM WITH THE UTMOST SOLEMNITY WHAT THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES BELIEVE IN AND THEY CONTINUE TO INSTILL IT INTO HIM TILL THE DECEPTION HAS BY HABIT GROWN INTO THE CHILD'S NATURE
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE CAN ALONE SOLVE IT BY GIVING A NEW MEANING TO LIFE
EVERY CHURCH PRESENTS EXACTLY THE SAME PROOFS OF THE SUCCESSION AND EVEN THE SAME MIRACLES IN SUPPORT OF ITS AUTHENTICITY AS EVERY OTHER
THIS WAS HOW THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THEM IN 1818
WHAT IS SOCIALISM BUT A PROTEST AGAINST THIS ABNORMAL POSITION IN WHICH THE GREATER PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION OF OUR WORLD IS PLACED
CHAPTER V
THE DIFFICULTY HERE WOULD BE TO DECIDE PRECISELY WHAT INCIDENT DID PROVOKE THE WAR SINCE WHENEVER WAR IS DECLARED THERE ARE VERY MANY SUCH INCIDENTS AND ONE WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE FROM WHICH TO RECKON THE TWO MONTHS INTERVAL 3
WE HAVE SEEN THEM KILL DOGS CHAINED AT THEIR MASTERS DOORS TO TRY THEIR NEW REVOLVERS WE HAVE SEEN THEM FIRE ON COWS LYING IN A FIELD FOR NO REASON WHATEVER SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF SHOOTING FOR A JOKE
THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS COMMAND THEY SAY IS VERY DIFFICULT AND PERTAINS ONLY TO PERFECTION
B
B
LET US ENTER THIS INEVITABLE NECESSARY PALACE OF WAR
AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY DO NOT EVEN ADMIT THE NATURAL QUESTION WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF TO EVERY SIMPLE MAN
THIS TRANSLATION CONTAINS WHAT SEEMS TO MY EARLY 21ST CENTURY PERCEPTION AS MISTAKES BOTH IN TYPOGRAPHY AND IN STANDARDNESS OF LANGUAGE
YOU MIGHT RISK MAKING A MISTAKE IF YOU HAD TIME TO SEE AND RETRIEVE YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU RAN THE RISK FOR SOMETHING OF SOME VALUE
THESE CHRISTIANS REFUSE TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY TO BEAR ARMS OR AT THE CALL OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE WAR ON ITS ENEMIES
A RELIGIOUS MAN NEED ONLY HAVE FAITH AND A LIBERAL MAN NEED ONLY PROMOTE THE MODIFICATION OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS--THE PROGRESS OF INDUSTRY
CHRIST HAS GIVEN EXPRESSION IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT TO THE ETERNAL IDEAL TOWARD WHICH MEN ARE SPONTANEOUSLY STRUGGLING AND ALSO THE DEGREE OF ATTAINMENT OF IT TO WHICH MEN MAY REACH IN OUR TIMES
THE STATEMENT IS DISAGREEABLE NO DOUBT
THERE REMAINS NOW ONLY ONE SPHERE OF HUMAN LIFE NOT ENCROACHED UPON BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY--THAT IS THE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC SPHERE THE SPHERE OF PRIVATE LIFE AND LABOR
THE LATTER SMART YOUNG FELLOWS IN THEIR CLEAN NEW UNIFORMS WERE STANDING ABOUT IN GROUPS OR SITTING SWINGING THEIR LEGS IN THE WIDE OPEN DOORWAYS OF THE LUGGAGE VANS
AND TO PREACH THIS CHRISTIAN TRUTH AND TO SUPPORT IT BY CHRISTIAN EXAMPLE WE SET UP AMONG THEM PRISONS GUILLOTINES GALLOWS PREPARATIONS FOR MURDER
C
BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE CONTINUED THE TORTURE
I KNOW OF THE CASE OF A SUB-LIEUTENANT OF THE GUARDS WHO IN 1891 DECLARED TO THE AUTHORITIES IN BERLIN THAT HE WOULD NOT AS A CHRISTIAN CONTINUE TO SERVE AND IN SPITE OF ALL ADMONITIONS THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS HE STUCK TO HIS RESOLUTION
AND WHY MOST OF ALL AM I TO CONSIDER AS ENEMIES THE PEOPLE OF A NEIGHBORING NATION WITH WHOM I HAVE HITHERTO LIVED AND WITH WHOM I WISH TO LIVE IN LOVE AND HARMONY AND TO KILL AND ROB THEM OR TO BRING THEM TO MISERY SIMPLY IN ORDER THAT THE KEYS OF THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM MAY BE IN THE HANDS OF ONE ARCHBISHOP AND NOT ANOTHER THAT ONE GERMAN AND NOT ANOTHER MAY BE PRINCE IN BULGARIA OR THAT THE ENGLISH RATHER THAN THE AMERICAN MERCHANTS MAY CAPTURE SEALS
THOSE MEN WHO ACCEPT A NEW TRUTH WHEN IT HAS GAINED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF ACCEPTANCE ALWAYS PASS OVER ALL AT ONCE IN MASSES
AND THESE EXAMPLES ARE THE MORE ALARMING FOR THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE FACT THAT THESE NON-COMPLIANT PERSONS OFTEN BELONG NOT TO THE SO-CALLED LOWER UNEDUCATED CLASSES BUT ARE MEN OF FAIR OR GOOD EDUCATION
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE DEAD MAY BURY THEIR DEAD ONE THING ONLY IS NEEDFUL FOR THEM TO FOLLOW THEIR MASTER EVEN PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTION AS TO THE PRINCIPLE LAID DOWN IN THESE TWO BOOKS AS TO THE CHRISTIAN'S DUTY IN HIS ATTITUDE TO WAR ONE CANNOT HELP PERCEIVING THE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE AND THE URGENT NEED OF DECIDING THE QUESTION
A JUDGE OR A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR KNOWS THAT THROUGH HIS SENTENCE OR HIS PROSECUTION HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF POOR WRETCHES ARE AT ONCE TORN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THROWN INTO PRISON WHERE THEY MAY GO OUT OF THEIR MINDS KILL THEMSELVES WITH PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS OR STARVE THEMSELVES
AND WHAT IS THE USE OF THESE LAWYERS AND JUDGES WHO DON'T DECIDE CIVIL CASES WITH JUSTICE AND RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES THE USELESSNESS OF PUNISHMENTS IN CRIMINAL CASES
AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE FOUND WITHOUT HESITATION OPPOSED TO THE ONE FAVORABLE TO THE OTHER
IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE SERVILE INSTRUMENTS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE AUTHORITIES IT COULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED THE HEAD OF THE LANDOWNER TO ROB THE PEASANTS OF THE FOREST THEY HAD TENDED NOR OF THE OFFICIALS TO THINK THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR SALARIES TAKEN FROM THE FAMISHING PEOPLE THE PRICE OF THEIR OPPRESSION
CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NOT GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD IN ITS TRUE SIMPLE AND DIRECT SENSE EVEN IN THESE DAYS WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL HAS PENETRATED EVEN TO THE DARKEST RECESSES OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
HE WHO HAS COMPASSION ON US WILL GIVE US CHARITY BUT AS FOR THE GOVERNMENT RATIONS WE HAVE NOT HAD THEM AND WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE THEM THESE WERE THE WORDS OF THOSE PEASANTS WHO DECLARE THAT THERE ARE NUMBERS LIKE THEM RUSSIA
AND THEREFORE THE CHRISTIAN NOT ONLY CANNOT PROMISE TO OBEY THE WILL OF ANY OTHER MAN WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED BY THAT WILL
WE ARE POOR THOUGH WE HAVE THE WEALTH AND TRADE OF THE WHOLE WORLD THAT WAS WRITTEN ALMOST 150 YEARS AGO
THE RULERS TWO OR THREE IN NUMBER MEET TOGETHER IN CABINETS SECRETLY DELIBERATE WITHOUT REGISTERS WITHOUT PUBLICITY AND CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY AND SEND MEN TO BE MURDERED PROTESTS AGAINST ARMAMENTS BURDENSOME TO THE PEOPLE HAVE NOT ORIGINATED IN OUR TIMES SAYS SIGNOR E
THEY KEPT THEIR EYES ON THEM TILL THEY HAD PASSED BY THEM AND THEN SET OFF RUNNING STILL MORE MERRILY STAMPING THEIR HEELS ON THE PLATFORM LAUGHING AND CHATTERING AFTER THE MANNER OF HEALTHY GOOD-NATURED YOUNG FELLOWS TRAVELING IN LIVELY COMPANY
I PROMISE AND SWEAR BY ALMIGHTY GOD UPON HIS HOLY GOSPEL ETC TO DEFEND ETC AND THAT IS TO MURDER ANYONE I AM TOLD TO AND TO DO EVERYTHING I AM TOLD BY MEN I KNOW NOTHING OF AND WHO CARE NOTHING FOR ME EXCEPT AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR PERPETRATING THE CRIMES BY WHICH THEY ARE KEPT IN THEIR POSITION OF POWER AND MY BROTHERS IN THEIR CONDITION OF MISERY
MAN IS ALWAYS LOOKING TOWARD THE PROMISED LAND AND THERE THE HARVESTS ARE TO RIPEN WITH NO FEAR OF THEIR BEING TORN UP BY SHELLS OR CRUSHED BY CANNON WHEELS
WHATEVER WE MAY DO--FOUND COMPANIES BUILD PALACES AND MONUMENTS WRITE SONGS AND POEMS--IT IS ALL NOT FOR LONG TIME
THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES AS BODIES WHICH ASSERT THEIR OWN INFALLIBILITY ARE INSTITUTIONS OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY
TO DO THIS MEN MUST LOVE POWER
AND YET SOCIAL REFORMERS ARE BUSY PROMULGATING THE IDEA THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND IS EVEN PERNICIOUS AND IMMORAL FOR EVERY MAN SEPARATELY TO WORK OUT HIS OWN FREEDOM
THE WIVES AND MOTHERS KNOWING THAT THEY WILL BE LEFT FOR THREE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS WITHOUT THEIR BREADWINNERS WEEP AND REHEARSE THEIR WOES ALOUD
WE TEACH THE PEOPLE NOTHING NEW NOTHING BUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE ONLY IN A MORE PERFECT FORM SAY THE CHURCHMEN
THAT EVERY OPINION WHICH DIFFERS FROM THE CODE OF DOGMAS WE BELIEVE IN AT A GIVEN TIME IS HERESY
THE MEN OF THE HIGHER DOMINATING CLASSES WHOSE CONSCIENCE IS NATURALLY NOT SENSITIVE OR HAS BECOME BLUNTED IF THEY DON'T SUFFER THROUGH CONSCIENCE SUFFER FROM FEAR AND HATRED
AND EXPRESSES ITS FIRM AND UNSHAKEN BELIEF IN THE ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OF THE CAUSE OF PEACE AND OF THE PRINCIPLES ADVOCATED AT THESE MEETINGS THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF THE CONGRESS IS THE NECESSITY 1 OF DIFFUSING AMONG ALL PEOPLE BY ALL MEANS THE CONVICTION OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF WAR AND THE GREAT BLESSING OF PEACE AND 2 OF ROUSING GOVERNMENTS TO THE SENSE OF THE SUPERIORITY OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION OVER WAR AND OF THE CONSEQUENT ADVISABILITY AND NECESSITY OF DISARMAMENT
BUT FIRE NOW DOES NOT MEAN SHOOTING INTO THE SAND FOR AMUSEMENT IT MEANS FIRING ON THEIR BROKEN-DOWN EXPLOITED FATHERS AND BROTHERS WHOM THEY SEE THERE IN THE CROWD WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN SHOUTING AND WAVING THEIR ARMS
THE VERY RISKS TO WHICH THEY VOLUNTARILY EXPOSE THEMSELVES SHOW THAT THEY ARE INCORRUPTIBLE
IN AMERICA THERE ARE FEWER SOLDIERS THAN IN OTHER STATES
IF YOU TELL ME THAT IF I DO IT NOT I SHALL RECEIVE SOME INJURY FROM SOMEONE THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE I CANNOT ANTICIPATE FROM ANYONE AN INJURY SO GREAT AS THE INJURY YOU BRING ON ME IF I OBEY YOU
I DON'T WANT TO FLOG MYSELF AND I WON'T DO IT
THIS WOULD BE MOST LOGICAL AND THEORETICALLY NOTHING WOULD APPEAR MORE NATURAL TO ITS ADVOCATES WHO DO NOT OBSERVE THAT LOVE IS A SENTIMENT WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE FELT BUT WHICH IT IS USELESS TO ADVOCATE
THE CHRISTIAN IN PROMISING UNCONDITIONAL FULFILLMENT OF THE LAWS OF MEN IN THE FUTURE WOULD SHOW PLAINLY BY THAT PROMISE THAT THE INNER LAW OF GOD DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FOR HIM THE SOLE LAW OF HIS LIFE
STILL LESS POSSIBLE IS IT TO PROVE THEM BY EXPERIMENT SINCE THE WHOLE MATTER TURNS ON THE QUESTION OUGHT WE TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT
ROUND THE TABLE ARE SITTING THE REVISING OFFICERS LOOKING COLLECTED AND INDIFFERENT
TO DO THIS THE PRIEST HOLDS THE CHILD IN HIS ARMS BEFORE THE IMAGES OF THE SAINTS CALLED BY THE PEOPLE PLAINLY GODS AND READS WORDS OF EXORCIZING POWER AND THIS PURIFIES THE MOTHER
DO MEN BELIEVE IN IT
OF SUCH PHILOSOPHIES OF LIFE WE KNOW THREE
THIS TRANSITION FROM ONE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE TO ANOTHER IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED BY DEGREES LIKE THE SAND RUNNING THROUGH THE HOURGLASS GRAIN AFTER GRAIN
THE VERY FACT OF THIS QUESTION BEING RAISED SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO DISCUSSED IT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TEACHING OF CHRIST WHO REJECTED ALL OUTWARD OBSERVANCES--ABLUTIONS PURIFICATIONS FASTS AND SABBATHS
LATER ON I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM WILSON A PUPIL AND COLLEAGUE OF BALLOU'S AND ENTERED INTO CORRESPONDENCE WITH BALLOU HIMSELF
THE CONGRESS IN CONSIDERATION OF THE FACT THAT THE TIMIDITY OF A SINGLE POWER MIGHT DELAY THE CONVOCATION OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONGRESS IS OF OPINION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH SHOULD FIRST DISMISS ANY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WOULD CONFER A SIGNAL BENEFIT ON EUROPE AND MANKIND BECAUSE IT WOULD BY PUBLIC OPINION OBLIGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO FOLLOW ITS EXAMPLE AND BY THE MORAL FORCE OF THIS ACCOMPLISHED FACT WOULD HAVE INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED THE CONDITIONS OF ITS NATIONAL DEFENSE
BY REWARDING AN ACTION ALWAYS REGARDED AS BASE AND COWARDLY EVEN BY MEN ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF MORALITY WILLIAM HAS SHOWN THAT A SOLDIER'S CHIEF DUTY--THE ONE MOST APPRECIATED BY THE AUTHORITIES--IS THAT OF EXECUTIONER
IN A WORLD MOREOVER WHICH PROFESSES TO BELIEVE CHRIST'S DOCTRINE THAT WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND THAT TRUE MERIT AND DIGNITY IS TO BE FOUND IN SERVING ONE'S NEIGHBOR NOT IN EXPLOITING HIM
HE MAY PERFORM THE ACT THAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO HIM AND HE MAY COME TO HIS SENSES AT THE MOMENT OF PERFORMING IT
THIS PLAGUE IS INFECTIOUS AND SPREADS BECAUSE DIRECTLY ONE GOVERNMENT INCREASES ITS ARMAMENT ALL THE OTHERS DO LIKEWISE
THOSE WHO SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE BOUND TO OBEY THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MISDEEDS THEY COMMIT IS TRANSFERRED FROM THEM TO THEIR RULERS DECEIVE THEMSELVES
THE IDEAL IS NOT TO DESIRE TO DO ILL TO ANYONE NOT TO PROVOKE ILL WILL TO LOVE ALL MEN
AND SECONDLY IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ME THAT IF WE OUR OWN SELVES DO NOT FLOG OURSELVES NO ONE WILL FLOG US
BOTH CAUSES MUTUALLY DEPENDENT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SAME RESULT AT ONCE
MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY DO NOT MERELY PRETEND TO HATE OPPRESSION INEQUALITY CLASS DISTINCTION AND EVERY KIND OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS
ANOTHER ATTITUDE TO WAR HAS SOMETHING TRAGICAL IN IT
WITHOUT THESE PRINCIPLES TRUE LIFE COULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
THE EVIL WHICH WE SEE AMONG PEOPLES LIVING UNDER A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION THEY ATTRIBUTE NOT TO THAT TYPE OF SOCIETY BUT TO ITS ABUSES WHICH THEY SAY CAN BE CORRECTED WITHOUT DESTROYING IT AND THUS HUMANITY WITHOUT DISCARDING THE STATE ORGANIZATION CAN DEVELOP AND ATTAIN A HIGH DEGREE OF HAPPINESS
BUT SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER EVEN IF IT IS TRUE THAT PUBLIC OPINION WHEN IT HAS ATTAINED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DEFINITENESS AND PRECISION CAN CONVERT THE INERT MASS OF MEN OUTSIDE THE CHRISTIAN WORLD--THE NON-CHRISTIAN RACES--AS WELL AS THE COARSE AND DEPRAVED WHO ARE LIVING IN ITS MIDST WHAT PROOFS HAVE WE THAT THIS CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION HAS ARISEN AND IS ABLE TO REPLACE FORCE AND RENDER IT UNNECESSARY
WITHOUT JUSTICE WHAT IS AN EMPIRE BUT A GREAT BAND OF BRIGANDS AND IS NOT EVERY BAND OF BRIGANDS A LITTLE EMPIRE
WE KILL THE CRIMINAL THAT SOCIETY MAY BE RID OF HIM AND WE NEVER KNOW WHETHER THE CRIMINAL OF TO-DAY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A CHANGED MAN TOMORROW AND WHETHER OUR PUNISHMENT OF HIM IS NOT USELESS CRUELTY
BUT I WON'T DO IT
THUS THE NUMBER OF MEN WHO ACCEPT THE NEW TRUTH BECOMES GREATER AND GREATER AND THE TRUTH BECOMES MORE AND MORE COMPREHENSIBLE
UNDERLYING ALL THESE IDEAS AND EXPRESSIONS THERE IS SOME STRANGE MISCONCEPTION
BEFORE THE TOWN HALL OF THE DISTRICT WERE THE SOLDIERY A BATTALION OF POLICE WITH THEIR REVOLVERS SLUNG ROUND THEM WITH RED CORDS THE PERSONS OF MOST IMPORTANCE AMONG THE PEASANTS AND THE CULPRITS
BUT WHAT GOOD OR USEFUL THING CAN COME OF ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS IF MEN DO NOT SPEAK AND ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE TRUTH
THE CONGRESS FEELS THAT IT CAN AFFIRM THAT THE WHOLE OF EUROPE DESIRES PEACE AND AWAITS WITH IMPATIENCE THE SUPPRESSION OF ARMAMENTS WHICH UNDER THE PLEA OF DEFENSE BECOME IN THEIR TURN A DANGER BY KEEPING ALIVE MUTUAL DISTRUST AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE CAUSE OF THAT GENERAL ECONOMIC DISTURBANCE WHICH STANDS IN THE WAY OF SETTLING IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER THE PROBLEMS OF LABOR AND POVERTY WHICH OUGHT TO TAKE PRECEDENCE OF ALL OTHERS
AND AMONG THE MILLIONS OF THOSE WHO DID TAKE THE OATH THOSE DOZENS GO ON LIVING WHO DID NOT TAKE THE OATH
HAVING LEARNT BY EXPERIENCE UNDER THE OPERATION OF CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE THE VANITY OF ALL THAT IS GAINED BY VIOLENCE MEN SOMETIMES IN ONE SOMETIMES IN SEVERAL GENERATIONS LOSE THE VICES WHICH ARE GENERATED BY THE PASSION FOR POWER AND WEALTH
THIS CONTRADICTION RUNS THROUGH EVERYTHING IN ECONOMIC LIFE IN POLITICAL LIFE AND IN INTERNATIONAL LIFE
NO UNLESS THE MONEY IS DESTINED FOR SOME SPECIAL OBJECT RIGHT IN ITSELF AND GOOD BOTH IN AIM AND MEANS
USE OF FORCE NOT OPPOSED TO CHRISTIANITY--2D REPLY
CERTAINLY NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD BE CAPABLE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL PROFIT OF DOING A HUNDREDTH PART OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR OF OREL DID
THE GREATER NUMBER OF LOANS RAISED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF EUROPE WERE WITH A VIEW TO WAR
TO EXPRESS IN THE NAME OF THE CONGRESS ITS PROFOUND REVERENCE FOR THE MEMORY OF AURELIO SAFFI THE GREAT ITALIAN JURIST A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE OF PEACE AND LIBERTY
3-6 SAID CHRIST
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BEES COULD NEVER ESCAPE FROM THEIR POSITION JUST AS IT SEEMS THAT WORLDLY MEN CAUGHT IN THE TOILS OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE CAN NEVER ESCAPE
HOW COULD THE MEN WHO BEGAN THE WHOLE BUSINESS THE LANDOWNER THE COMMISSIONER THE JUDGES AND THOSE WHO GAVE THE ORDER AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT THE MINISTERS THE TZAR WHO ARE ALSO GOOD MEN PROFESSED CHRISTIANS HOW COULD THEY ELABORATE SUCH A PLAN AND ASSENT TO IT KNOWING ITS CONSEQUENCES
MEN LIVED IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND RACES AT FEUD WITH ONE ANOTHER PLUNDERING OUTRAGING AND KILLING ONE ANOTHER
AND SUCH LOVE THOUGH FAR FROM BEING SO STRONG AS LOVE OF SELF IS MET WITH PRETTY OFTEN
THERE YOU HAVE AN EPITOME OF THE WORK OF OUR CHURCH
THEY ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS
THAT IS JUST THE CASE WITH THE MEN IN THE TOULA TRAIN AND IN GENERAL WITH EVERYONE CARRYING OUT ACTS OF STATE VIOLENCE IN OUR DAY
WHERE HE MEANT VILLAGE THE BOOK HAS VILAGE
BUT A KING OR AN EMPEROR WHO RECEIVES MILLIONS FOR HIS POST AND KNOWS THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ROUND HIM WHO WOULD LIKE TO DETHRONE HIM AND TAKE HIS PLACE WHO KNOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER RECEIVE SUCH A REVENUE OR SO MUCH HONOR IN ANY OTHER POSITION WHO KNOWS IN MOST CASES THROUGH HIS MORE OR LESS DESPOTIC RULE THAT IF HE WERE DETHRONED HE WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER FOR ALL HIS ABUSE OF POWER--HE CANNOT BUT BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY AND EVEN SACREDNESS OF THE EXISTING ORDER
IN MY BOOK I MADE IT AN ACCUSATION AGAINST THE TEACHERS OF THE CHURCH THAT THEIR TEACHING IS OPPOSED TO CHRIST'S COMMANDS CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY EXPRESSED IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND OPPOSED IN ESPECIAL TO HIS COMMAND IN REGARD TO RESISTANCE TO EVIL AND THAT IN THIS WAY THEY DEPRIVE CHRIST'S TEACHING OF ALL VALUE
FROM THE BASEMENT ONE CANNOT JUDGE OF THE EFFECT OF THE SPIRE
WE ADVOCATE NO JACOBINICAL DOCTRINES
OF THE PATRIARCHS AND THE PROPHETS CONTAINED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT WHICH THE HEBREWS ORDINARILY CALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS
ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION IS THAT THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF LOVE OF GOD AND THEREFORE OF HIS SERVICE IS AN OBSCURE MYSTIC PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES NO DEFINITE OBJECT FOR LOVE AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE REPLACED BY THE MORE EXACT AND COMPREHENSIBLE PRINCIPLES OF LOVE FOR MEN AND THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY
IT MAY WELL BE THAT GOVERNMENT WAS NECESSARY AND IS STILL NECESSARY FOR ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTE TO IT SAYS THE MAN WHO HAS MASTERED THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE
BUT IT MUST BE ANSWERED
AND IF THE GOOSE LAYS NO MORE EGGS LIKE THE AMERICAN INDIANS NEGROES AND FIJIANS THEN IT IS KILLED IN SPITE OF THE SINCERE PROTESTS OF PHILANTHROPISTS
IN THE SAME WAY SOME PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO BE DRILLED AND TO BEAR ARMS HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER ARREST ON A CHARGE OF BREACH OF DISCIPLINE AND INSOLENCE
MOTHER OF GOD VIRGIN REJOICE THEE ETC ETC
IF COLUMBUS HAD REASONED THUS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE WEIGHED ANCHOR
THIS DIFFERENCE HAS ALWAYS EXISTED AND HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DEFINED AS THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION HAS BEEN MORE WIDELY DIFFUSED AND MORE CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD
WE SEE THE SAME THING IN OUR MODERN WORLD
IF WE ABIDE EVIL BY OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF NOT OPPOSING EVIL BY EVIL WE CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN SEDITION TREASON OR VIOLENCE
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS WRONG TO PUNISH THE INNOCENT JESUS BUT HE SAW IN HIM A SOURCE OF DANGER NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND THEREFORE HE SAID
THEY REFUSE TO TAKE THE OATH IN THE LAW COURTS BECAUSE OATHS ARE DIRECTLY FORBIDDEN BY THE GOSPEL
UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IS ONLY THE INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CARRIED TO ITS FURTHEST LIMITS AND BECOMING EVIDENT WHEN A CERTAIN STAGE OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT IS REACHED
WE SHALL NOT THINK IT STRANGE CONCERNING THE FIERY TRIAL WHICH IS TO TRY US BUT REJOICE INASMUCH AS WE ARE PARTAKERS OF CHRIST'S SUFFERINGS
AND YOU SOOTHE HIS MIND REVEREND FATHER SOOTHE HIM
THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY HAS LATELY SHOWN STILL MORE CLEARLY THE DUTIES OF THE ARMY BY THANKING AND REWARDING A SOLDIER FOR KILLING A DEFENSELESS CITIZEN WHO MADE HIS APPROACH INCAUTIOUSLY
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A HIGHER TRUTH REVEALED AT FIRST TO A FEW PERSONS GRADUALLY GAINS GROUND TILL IT HAS TAKEN HOLD OF SUCH A NUMBER OF PERSONS THAT THE OLD PUBLIC OPINION FOUNDED ON A LOWER ORDER OF TRUTHS BEGINS TO TOTTER AND THE NEW IS READY TO TAKE ITS PLACE BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
THEY ALL IMPLORED MERCY SHRIEKED AND GROANED
TO BEGIN WITH THEY HAVE RECOURSE TO EVERY MEANS OF COERCION USED IN OUR TIMES TO CORRECT THE CULPRIT AND BRING HIM TO A BETTER MIND AND THESE MEASURES ARE CARRIED OUT WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY
WHEN ONE SEES IN THE MIDST OF A TOWN WHERE ANY EFFORT AT VIOLENCE IN SELF-DEFENSE IS FORBIDDEN WHERE THE SALE OF POWDER AND OF CHEMICALS WHERE FURIOUS DRIVING AND PRACTICING AS A DOCTOR WITHOUT A DIPLOMA AND SO ON ARE NOT ALLOWED
HELCHITSKY'S FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS THAT CHRISTIANITY BY ALLYING ITSELF WITH TEMPORAL POWER IN THE DAYS OF CONSTANTINE AND BY CONTINUING TO DEVELOP IN SUCH CONDITIONS HAS BECOME COMPLETELY DISTORTED AND HAS CEASED TO BE CHRISTIAN ALTOGETHER
FOR THE LATTER THE WELFARE OF THE PERSONALITY DEMANDED AN EVER-WIDENING EXTENSION OF THE SPHERE OF LOVE
SOON AFTER THE APPEARANCE OF MY BOOK IN GERMAN I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM PRAGUE FROM A PROFESSOR OF THE UNIVERSITY THERE INFORMING ME OF THE EXISTENCE OF A WORK NEVER YET PRINTED BY HELCHITSKY A TSECH OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY ENTITLED THE NET OF FAITH IN THIS WORK THE PROFESSOR TOLD ME HELCHITSKY EXPRESSED PRECISELY THE SAME VIEW AS TO TRUE AND FALSE CHRISTIANITY AS I HAD EXPRESSED IN MY BOOK WHAT I BELIEVE THE PROFESSOR WROTE TO ME THAT HELCHITSKY'S WORK WAS TO BE PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE TSECH LANGUAGE IN THE JOURNAL OF THE PETERSBURG ACADEMY OF SILENCE
AFTER CONSCIENTIOUSLY EXPLAINING IN BRIEF THE CONTENTS OF MY BOOK FARRAR SAYS
THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF COMPLIANCE AND NON-COMPLIANCE ARE AS FOLLOWS
7
THE PROFESSION OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY NOT ONLY EXCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOGNIZING GOVERNMENT BUT EVEN DESTROYS ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS
IF THE CROWD DOES NOT DISPERSE EVEN ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GIVES THE ORDER TO FIRE OVER THE HEADS OF THE CROWD
THAT IS THE FOURTH COMMAND
MU-EPSILON-TAU-ALPHA-NU-OMICRON-ZETA-EPSILON-TAU EPSILON ONE MAY NOT SHARE THIS VIEW OF LIFE ONE MAY REJECT IT ONE MAY SHOW ITS INACCURACY AND ITS ERRONEOUSNESS BUT WE CANNOT JUDGE OF THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING WITHOUT MASTERING THIS VIEW OF LIFE
THEY ARE AMAZING PEOPLE TRULY BUT THOSE WHO LIKE DE VOGUE AND OTHERS WHO PROFESSING THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION REGARD WAR AS NOT ONLY INEVITABLE BUT BENEFICIAL AND THEREFORE DESIRABLE--THEY ARE TERRIBLE HIDEOUS IN THEIR MORAL PERVERSION
SOME PEOPLE--A MINORITY--BY A KIND OF PROPHETIC INSTINCT DIVINE THE TRUTH OF THE DOCTRINE SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO IT AND ADOPT IT
IT CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICE LIKE EVERY VIRTUE ENJOINED BY THE LAW OF GOD
NO ONE IN THE TIME OF PLATO WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO GIVE HIS NAME TO A DOCTRINE IN WHICH THE THEORY OF IDEAS HAD NO PLACE AND ONE WOULD DESERVEDLY HAVE EXCITED THE RIDICULE OF GREECE BY TRYING TO PASS OFF EPICURUS OR ZENO AS A DISCIPLE OF THE ACADEMY
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE HAS NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE DOCTRINE OF THE POSITIVISTS COMMUNISTS AND ALL THE APOSTLES OF THE UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF MANKIND BASED ON THE GENERAL ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A BROTHERHOOD
DE CAPRIVI--ALL PRIVILEGES OF RULING CLASSES BASED ON VIOLENCE--THE INCREASE OF ARMIES UP TO POINT OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE--UNIVERSAL COMPULSORY SERVICE DESTROYS ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL LIFE WHICH GOVERNMENT IS INTENDED TO PRESERVE--COMPULSORY SERVICE IS THE FURTHEST LIMIT OF SUBMISSION SINCE IN NAME OF THE STATE IT REQUIRES SACRIFICE OF ALL THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO A MAN--IS GOVERNMENT NECESSARY?--THE SACRIFICES DEMANDED BY GOVERNMENT IN COMPULSORY SERVICE HAVE NO LONGER ANY REASONABLE BASIS--AND THERE IS MORE ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED BY NOT SUBMITTING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE STATE THAN BY SUBMITTING TO THEM
AND THUS THE EVIL OF VIOLENCE WHEN IT PASSES INTO THE HANDS OF AUTHORITY IS ALWAYS GROWING AND GROWING AND IN TIME BECOMES GREATER THAN THE EVIL IT IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPRESS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE TENDENCY TO VIOLENCE IN THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY BECOMES WEAKER AND WEAKER SO THAT THE VIOLENCE OF AUTHORITY IS LESS AND LESS NEEDED
SINCE THE CHRISTIAN CANNOT EMPLOY VIOLENCE HE IS OBLIGED TO OFFER HIS PROPERTY AT ONCE TO THE LOSS BY VIOLENCE INFLICTED ON IT BY THE AUTHORITIES
FREEDOM CANNOT BE BESTOWED ON OR TAKEN FROM A CHRISTIAN OR CHRISTIANS
THE CHRISTIAN SAYS
THAT IS HE CAN BY REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH REGARD HIS ACTION AS NECESSARY AND JUSTIFIABLE OR HE MAY RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH AND REGARD HIS ACT AS WRONG AND CENSURE HIMSELF FOR IT
THE DISADVANTAGES OF COMPLIANCE WILL BE AS FOLLOWS
INSTEAD OF EVERY MAN DIRECTING HIS ENERGIES TO FREEING HIMSELF TO TRANSFORMING HIS CONCEPTION OF LIFE PEOPLE SEEK FOR AN EXTERNAL UNITED METHOD OF GAINING FREEDOM AND CONTINUE TO RIVET THEIR CHAINS FASTER AND FASTER
AND IT RECOMMENDS THAT THE THIRD SUNDAY IN DECEMBER BE SET APART FOR THAT PURPOSE
AND HENCE THEY MUST BECOME MORE AND MORE SUPERFLUOUS
THE TRAIN I MET ON THE 9TH OF SEPTEMBER GOING WITH SOLDIERS GUNS CARTRIDGES AND RODS TO CONFIRM THE RICH LANDOWNER IN THE POSSESSION OF A SMALL FOREST WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE STARVING PEASANTS WHICH THEY WERE IN THE DIREST NEED OF AND HE WAS IN NO NEED OF AT ALL WAS A STRIKING PROOF OF HOW MEN ARE CAPABLE OF DOING DEEDS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THEIR PRINCIPLES AND THEIR CONSCIENCE WITHOUT PERCEIVING IT
THE ERROR AND IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH A LIMITATION IS SHOWN IN THE GOSPEL WITH SPECIAL CLEARNESS IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE JUDGMENT OF CAIAPHAS WHO MAKES PRECISELY THIS DISTINCTION
AM I OR AM I NOT TO RESIST BY FORCE WHAT I REGARD AS EVIL
WHATEVER MEANS MEN HAVE DEVISED FOR PREVENTING THOSE IN AUTHORITY FROM OVER-RIDING PUBLIC INTERESTS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT OR FOR INTRUSTING POWER ONLY TO THE MOST FAULTLESS PEOPLE THEY HAVE NOT SO FAR SUCCEEDED IN EITHER OF THOSE AIMS
A MAN OF SENSITIVE CONSCIENCE CANNOT BUT SUFFER IF HE LIVES SUCH A LIFE
MEN OF SCIENCE REGARD AS CHRISTIANITY ONLY THE TENETS HELD BY THE DIFFERENT CHURCHES IN THE PAST AND PRESENT
THEY ARE RIGHT
WHY AM I TO HAND OVER THE FRUITS OF MY LABORS TO THEM IN THE SHAPE OF TAXES KNOWING THAT THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON THE SUPPORT OF OFFICIALS PRISONS CHURCHES ARMIES ON THINGS THAT ARE HARMFUL AND ON MY OWN ENSLAVEMENT
NEXT ONE AND WITH A WEARY AIR SITS DOWN AGAIN AT THE TABLE
THE GOOD CANNOT SEIZE POWER NOR RETAIN IT
SUCH IS THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED NOT ONLY BY FARRAR'S ARTICLE BUT BY ALL THOSE SOLEMN SERMONS ARTICLES AND BOOKS WHICH MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE FROM ALL SIDES DIRECTLY THERE IS ANYWHERE A GLIMPSE OF TRUTH EXPOSING A PREDOMINANT FALSEHOOD
IT WILL BE OUR LEADING OBJECT TO DEVISE WAYS AND MEANS FOR EFFECTING A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE VIEWS FEELINGS AND PRACTICES OF SOCIETY RESPECTING THE SINFULNESS OF WAR AND THE TREATMENT OF ENEMIES
CHAPTER VI
FOR TWENTY YEARS PAST EVERY RESOURCE OF SCIENCE HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED IN THE INVENTION OF ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION AND SOON A FEW CHARGES OF CANNON WILL SUFFICE TO ANNIHILATE A WHOLE ARMY
WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO ANY HUMAN GOVERNMENT
BUT JESUS FORBIDS IT
FOR AFTER ALL THESE THINGS DO THE GENTILES SEEK FOR YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF ALL THESE THINGS
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS BUT EVERY MORNING I MUST HAVE A CIGAR A SWEETMEAT AN ICE AND SUCH THINGS WHICH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE BEEN WASTING THEIR HEALTH IN MANUFACTURING AND I ENJOY THESE THINGS AND DEMAND THEM
THERE IS NO MERIT IN WHAT IS GOOD NOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS EVIL IN OUR ACTIONS SINCE THEY ARE NOT DONE OF OUR OWN WILL IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE VERY SAME THING IS SAID IN THE INSTRUCTIONS TO SOLDIERS WHICH THEY MAKE THEM LEARN--THAT IS THAT THE OFFICER IS ALONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS COMMAND
ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INFERIOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
AT LAST THEY ALL BEGAN TO BEG HIM TO TAKE THEM BACK TO THE ASYLUM TO THEIR MEANINGLESS BUT CUSTOMARY WAY OF LIFE TO THEIR KEEPERS TO BLOWS STRAIT WAISTCOATS AND SOLITARY CELLS
LET US PROCLAIM THESE ABSOLUTE TRUTHS
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF DIVISION BETWEEN MEN OF THEIR HATRED OF ONE ANOTHER OF WARS BATTLES INQUISITIONS MASSACRES OF ST BARTHOLOMEW AND SO ON
BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT THE LEARNED CRITICS OF THE DAY TRY TO DO
BUT IN ASSERTING THIS THEY ONLY ACCUSE THEMSELVES SAY THAT THEIR POWER I
I COULD QUOTE DOZENS OF SUCH CRITICS IN ALL OF WHOM WITHOUT EXCEPTION WE FIND THE SAME THING REPEATED
SO THIS AND NOTHING ELSE IS THE FAITH CALLED ORTHODOX THAT IS THE ACTUAL FAITH WHICH UNDER THE GUISE OF CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN WITH ALL THE FORCES OF THE CHURCH AND IS NOW WITH ESPECIAL ZEAL INSTILLED INTO THE PEOPLE
AND TO DO THIS FROM THE EARLIEST TIME MEN HAVE DEVISED DEFINITIONS OF EVIL AND TRIED TO MAKE THEM BINDING ON EVERYONE
IN THE YEAR 1884 I WROTE A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE WHAT I BELIEVE IN WHICH I DID IN FACT MAKE A SINCERE STATEMENT OF MY BELIEFS
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE REACHED THOSE LIMITS IN THE PRESENT DAY
IT SEEMS THAT ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTOOD CHRIST'S TEACHING LITERALLY AND LIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF IT ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID AND DONE BY ALL TRUE CHRISTIANS BY ALL THE CHRISTIAN SAINTS ALL THAT IS NOW REFORMING THE WORLD IN THE SHAPE OF SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM--IS SIMPLY EXAGGERATION NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT
THE PUNISHMENT OF FLOGGING BY WAY OF CARRYING THE DECREES OF THE AUTHORITIES INTO EFFECT HAS BEEN MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY ADOPTED OF LATE IN RUSSIA IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT WAS ABOLISHED BY LAW THIRTY YEARS AGO
WE LIVE IN TROUBLED TIMES
IF THERE IS A CATHOLIC CHURCH NOW WHICH ASSERTS ITS OWN INFALLIBILITY THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE THERE ARE CHURCHES--GRECO-RUSSIAN OLD ORTHODOX AND LUTHERAN--EACH ASSERTING ITS OWN INFALLIBILITY AND DENYING THAT OF ALL OTHER CHURCHES
THE SUPPRESSION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL TYPE OF SOCIETY IS NOT ONLY UNDESIRABLE SO LONG AS THERE IS ONLY A MINORITY OF TRUE CHRISTIANS
AND THAT IS CLEAR FROM THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE
DURING ALL THESE VICISSITUDES HE IS DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY AND HAS TO ENDURE EVERY KIND OF HUMILIATION AND SUFFERING AS A CONVICTED CRIMINAL
HE TOO ONLY AIMS AT PRESENTING ITS TRAGIC FEATURES WITHOUT SUGGESTING OR FORSEEING ANY ISSUE FROM THE POSITION
MEN OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT TO ACT IN THAT WAY IS NOT NECESSARY AND IS EVEN PREJUDICIAL TO THE ATTAINMENT OF THEIR OBJECT THE EMANCIPATION OF MEN FROM SLAVERY
FEARING TO MAKE THE EFFORT TO DETACH OURSELVES FROM OUR PERILOUS POSITION BECAUSE THE FUTURE IS NOT FULLY CLEAR TO US WE ARE LIKE PASSENGERS IN A FOUNDERING SHIP WHO THROUGH BEING AFRAID TO TRUST THEMSELVES TO THE BOAT WHICH WOULD CARRY THEM TO THE SHORE SHUT THEMSELVES UP IN THE CABIN AND REFUSE TO COME OUT OF IT
AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A KIND OF CONCERT GOING ON IN THE BUILDINGS OF THE COURT CLUB IN THE SAME STREET AND A POLICE OFFICER NOTICING THE LITTLE GROUP COLLECTED NEAR THE CHURCH SENT A MOUNTED POLICEMAN TO DISPERSE IT
EXCEPT FOR HYPOCRISY MEN COULD NOT HAVE FAILED IF NOT TO PUT THE LAW IN PRACTICE AT LEAST TO RECOGNIZE IT AND ADMIT THAT IT IS WRONG NOT TO PUT IT IN PRACTICE
THE MORE THE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING WAS OBSCURED THE MORE THE MIRACULOUS WAS INTRODUCED INTO IT
CHRISTIAN LOVE IS THE RESULT ONLY OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE IN WHICH THE AIM OF LIFE IS TO LOVE AND SERVE GOD
THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR YOUR LIFE WHAT YE SHALL EAT OR WHAT YE SHALL DRINK
THEY SCARCELY EVER DECIDE UPON AN INTERNAL REFORM OR A NEW DEPARTURE IN FOREIGN POLITICS
WE MAKE A DISPLAY OF SENSELESS LUXURY IN THE MIDST OF SUFFERING POVERTY
WITH GOOD REASON HAVE ALL OR ALMOST ALL SO-CALLED SECTS OF CHRISTIANS RECOGNIZED THE CHURCH AS THE SCARLET WOMAN FORETOLD IN THE APOCALYPSE
FIRST PROMISE AND SWEAR TO US THAT YOU WILL SLAVISHLY OBEY US IN EVERYTHING WE DICTATE TO YOU AND WILL CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY GOOD AND AUTHORITATIVE EVERYTHING WE PLAN DECIDE AND CALL LAW
STILL LESS CAN HE CLAIM THIS FOR ANY BODY OF MEN
RESISTANCE IS RUIN
17 19 20
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OPPRESSED ITS SUBJECTS FOR CENTURIES AND HAS NEVER TROUBLED ITSELF ABOUT THE LITTLE RUSSIANS OF POLAND OR THE LETTS OF THE BALTIC PROVINCES OR THE RUSSIAN PEASANTS EXPLOITED BY EVERYONE
BUT FAR FROM DISTURBING THE HAPPINESS OF THE CHRISTIAN WHICH CONSISTS IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FULFILLING THE WILL OF GOD THEY MAY EVEN INTENSIFY IT WHEN THEY ARE INFLICTED ON HIM FOR FULFILLING HIS WILL
AND THE ERRONEOUSNESS OF SUCH A LIMITATION IS STILL MORE CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS SPOKEN TO PETER WHEN HE TRIED TO RESIST BY FORCE EVIL DIRECTED AGAINST JESUS MATT
PEOPLE TALK OF THE TIME WHEN ALL MEN SHALL PROFESS WHAT IS CALLED CHRISTIANITY THAT IS VARIOUS PROFESSIONS OF FAITH HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER WHEN ALL SHALL BE WELL-FED AND CLOTHED WHEN ALL SHALL BE UNITED FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER BY TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES AND BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY BALLOONS WHEN ALL THE WORKING CLASSES ARE PERMEATED BY SOCIALISTIC DOCTRINES WHEN THE TRADES UNIONS POSSESS SO MANY MILLIONS OF MEMBERS AND SO MANY MILLIONS OF RUBLES WHEN EVERYONE IS EDUCATED AND ALL CAN READ NEWSPAPERS AND LEARN ALL THE SCIENCES
THE VERDICT OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD HAS PRONOUNCED HIM AS PERHAPS THE GREATEST NOVELIST OF OUR GENERATION
ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENA OF OUR TIMES IS PRECISELY THIS ADVOCACY OF SLAVERY WHICH IS PROMULGATED AMONG THE MASSES NOT BY GOVERNMENTS IN WHOM IT IS INEVITABLE BUT BY MEN WHO IN ADVOCATING SOCIALISTIC THEORIES REGARD THEMSELVES AS THE CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM
THE SEDUCTIONS OF POWER AND ALL THE WEALTH HONOR AND LUXURY IT GIVES SEEM A SUFFICIENT AIM FOR MEN'S EFFORTS ONLY SO LONG AS THEY ARE UNATTAINED
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AFTER ALL REVOLUTIONS AND ALL ATTEMPTS AT REVOLUTION ALL CONSPIRACIES AND ALL VIOLENT CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT
WAS IT NAPOLEON I
THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN WARS DO NOT EVEN THINK OF ASKING THEMSELVES WHETHER THERE IS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE INNUMERABLE MURDERS WHETHER THEY ARE JUSTIFIABLE OR UNJUSTIFIABLE LAWFUL OR UNLAWFUL INNOCENT OR CRIMINAL
AND IT WAS THEN THAT CHRIST PREACHED HIS DOCTRINE WHICH CONSISTED NOT ONLY OF THE PROHIBITION OF RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE BUT GAVE A NEW CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND A MEANS OF PUTTING AN END TO CONFLICT BETWEEN ALL MEN NOT BY MAKING IT THE DUTY OF ONE SECTION ONLY OF MANKIND TO SUBMIT WITHOUT CONFLICT TO WHAT IS PRESCRIBED TO THEM BY CERTAIN AUTHORITIES BUT BY MAKING IT THE DUTY OF ALL--AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THOSE IN AUTHORITY--NOT TO RESORT TO FORCE AGAINST ANYONE IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
NO ONE FORCES THE PEOPLE TO WORK FOR THE LANDOWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS
NOT SOCIETY NOR THE STATE NOR ANYONE
CAN HE VOLUNTARILY VOTE OR FURNISH SOLDIERS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
SO THAT IT ALL AMOUNTS TO A MAN NO LONGER BELIEVING IN GOD NOR CHRIST AS THEY ARE REVEALED TO HIM BUT BELIEVING IN WHAT THE CHURCH ORDERS HIM TO BELIEVE IN
ONLY THEN THE FOGGING CEASED AND THE POLICE OFFICER MADE HIS ESCAPE
BUT ALL THESE OTHERS ARE ALSO STATES WHICH WANT HOLDING IN CHECK AND KEEPING WITHIN LIMITS AND FORCING TOO
BY THIS MADNESS HE DISCOVERED A NEW WORLD
HE DOES NOT SEE WHAT IS NOT YET LIGHTED UP BY THE LANTERN
AND THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ACCUSING HIM EITHER OF REVOLUTIONARY ACTS OR REVOLUTIONARY PLOTTING SINCE HE DECLARES THAT HE DOES NOT WISH TO ATTACK ANYTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY IS OPPOSED TO ANY USE OF FORCE AND FAR FROM PLOTTING IN SECRET HE SEEKS EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING AND DOING ALL THAT HE SAYS AND DOES IN THE MOST OPEN MANNER
AND THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE ATTITUDE TO EVERY MAN WHO WISHES TO BE CHRISTIAN TO THE CLAIM ON HIM FOR MILITARY SERVICE WHEN CHRIST HAS SAID RESIST NOT EVIL BY FORCE AS FOR THE QUESTION OF THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF THE AUTHOR REGARDS THAT AS DECIDED
JESUS CHRIST FORBIDS ME TO RESIST EVIL DOERS AND TO TAKE FROM THEM AN EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH BLOODSHED FOR BLOODSHED AND LIFE FOR LIFE
A NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CELEBRATED FRENCH WRITER GUY DE MAUPASSANT
ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S TEACHING THE GOOD ARE THOSE WHO ARE MEEK AND LONG-SUFFERING DO NOT RESIST EVIL BY FORCE FORGIVE INJURIES AND LOVE THEIR ENEMIES
TAKE THOUGHT OH MEN AND HAVE FAITH IN THE GOSPEL IN WHOSE TEACHING IS YOUR HAPPINESS
CAN MAN MAKE THIS EFFORT?--ACCORDING TO THE HYPOCRITICAL THEORY OF THE DAY MAN IS NOT FREE TO TRANSFORM HIS LIFE--MAN IS NOT FREE IN HIS ACTIONS BUT HE IS FREE TO ADMIT OR TO DENY THE TRUTH HE KNOWS--WHEN TRUTH IS ONCE ADMITTED IT BECOMES THE BASIS OF ACTION--MAN'S THREEFOLD RELATION TO TRUTH--THE REASON OF THE APPARENT INSOLUBILITY OF THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL--MAN'S FREEDOM CONSISTS IN THE RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH REVEALED TO HIM
ALL THE MEN WHO LIKE THE LANDOWNER THE COMMISSIONER THE MINISTER AND THE TZAR WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PERPETRATION OF THIS ACT AS WELL AS THOSE WHO WERE NOW GOING TO EXECUTE IT AND EVEN THOSE WHO WERE MERE SPECTATORS OF IT KNEW THAT IT WAS A WICKEDNESS AND WERE ASHAMED OF TAKING ANY SHARE IN IT AND EVEN OF BEING PRESENT AT IT
THESE PHYSICALLY VIGOROUS YOUNG MEN IN THESE DAYS OF UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION ALL YOUNG MEN HYPNOTIZED ARMED WITH MURDEROUS WEAPONS ALWAYS OBEDIENT TO THE GOVERNING AUTHORITIES AND READY FOR ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE AT THEIR COMMAND CONSTITUTE THE FOURTH AND PRINCIPAL METHOD OF ENSLAVING MEN
AND THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPE FOR THE BEES IF EACH OF THEM WERE NOT A LIVING SEPARATE CREATURE ENDOWED WITH WINGS OF ITS OWN
A FOURTH SECTION WHO BELIEVE IN THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION HOLD THAT SALVATION WILL COME WHEN THROUGH A VIOLENT REVOLUTION MEN ARE FORCED INTO COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY ABOLITION OF GOVERNMENT AND COLLECTIVE INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRY--THAT IS TO SAY THE REALIZATION OF ONE SIDE OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE
AND SO WE SEE THIS MAN WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE OF MIND OR DOUBT THAT PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE IN HIS SINCERITY ORGANIZING AN AGRICULTURAL EXHIBITION OR A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY OR SENDING SOME SOUP AND STOCKINGS BY HIS WIFE OR CHILDREN TO THREE OLD WOMEN AND BOLDLY IN HIS FAMILY IN DRAWING ROOMS IN COMMITTEES AND IN THE PRESS ADVOCATING THE GOSPEL OR HUMANITARIAN DOCTRINE OF LOVE FOR ONE'S NEIGHBOR IN GENERAL AND THE AGRICULTURAL LABORING POPULATION IN PARTICULAR WHOM HE IS CONTINUALLY EXPLOITING AND OPPRESSING
THE CHURCHES ARE EVERYWHERE THE SAME AND IF THE CATHOLIC THE ANGLICAN OR THE LUTHERAN CHURCH HAS NOT AT HAND A GOVERNMENT AS COMPLIANT AS THE RUSSIAN IT IS NOT DUE TO ANY INDISPOSITION TO PROFIT BY SUCH A GOVERNMENT
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT UNDER THE NECESSITY OF JUSTIFYING A CHRISTIAN GOVERNMENT
GOOD PEACEFUL MEN KNOWN TO ME PERSONALLY GOING WITH UNTROUBLED TRANQUILLITY TO PERPETRATE THE MOST BEASTLY SENSELESS AND VILE OF CRIMES
HE IS NOT FREE BECAUSE ALL HIS ACTIONS ARE CONDITIONED BY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING CAUSES
BUT WE CANNOT TREAT THE QUESTION AS THE LEARNED CRITICS OF CHRISTIANITY DO
THE CONSERVATIVES WERE INDIGNANT AT THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HINDERING THE ENERGETIC DESTRUCTION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS WHICH MAY RUIN THE NATIONAL PROSPERITY
IN ADDITION TO WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE QUAKERS I RECEIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME ALSO FROM AMERICA SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT FROM A SOURCE PERFECTLY DISTINCT AND PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN TO ME
BY A CHANGE OF LIFE OR BY A CHANGE OF CONSCIENCE
BUT EVEN IT BE SO SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS STILL THE SUPPRESSION OF GOVERNMENT VIOLENCE CAN ONLY BE POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE WHEN ALL MEN HAVE BECOME CHRISTIANS
ONE SET OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OF WHOM THERE ARE MILLIONS IN RUSSIA THE SO-CALLED SECTARIES CONSIDER THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER AS UNJUST AND TO BE DESTROYED ON THE GROUND OF THE GOSPEL TEACHING TAKEN IN ITS TRUE SENSE
DR REUEN THOMAS AND REV
FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO SELL ALL THOU HAST AND FOLLOW ME
IN AFFIRMING MY BELIEF IN CHRIST'S TEACHING I COULD NOT HELP EXPLAINING WHY I DO NOT BELIEVE AND CONSIDER AS MISTAKEN THE CHURCH'S DOCTRINE WHICH IS USUALLY CALLED CHRISTIANITY
WHICH ARE THE SAVAGES THE REAL SAVAGES
SHALL WE EXCLUDE THE NEGROES LIKE THE AMERICANS OR THE HINDOOS LIKE SOME ENGLISHMEN OR THE JEWS LIKE SOME OTHERS
TRY THE SIMPLE EXPERIMENT AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OF GIVING UP LYING AND REFUSING TO TAKE A PART IN EXECUTIONS AND ACTS OF VIOLENCE
THERE IS NO MOTIVE TO PRODUCE IT
THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE AND THERE IS NO CHANCE OF BREAKING THROUGH IT BY FORCE
AND PRETEND TO ENCOURAGE EDUCATION WHEN THEIR WHOLE STRENGTH IS BASED ON IGNORANCE
IT FURTHER EXPRESSES ITS CONVICTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE CONCERT OF ACTION AMONG THE NATIONS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE ENDS
WHAT IS OF USE IS NOT ALTERING THE EXISTING FORMS OF LIFE BUT SUBMITTING TO THEM AGAINST YOUR OWN CONVICTIONS INTRODUCING LIBERALISM INTO THE EXISTING INSTITUTIONS PROMOTING COMMERCE THE PROPAGANDA OF SOCIALISM AND THE TRIUMPHS OF WHAT IS CALLED SCIENCE AND THE DIFFUSION OF EDUCATION
BUT THE LIFE OF A SOCIETY AND SUCCESSION OF INDIVIDUALS FAMILY CLAN TRIBE OR STATE GOES ON LIVING AND THEREFORE A MAN MUST SACRIFICE HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY FOR THE LIFE OF THE FAMILY OR THE STATE
I ONLY KNOW THAT ON THE ONE HAND GOVERNMENT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR ME AND ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN NO LONGER CARRY OUT THE MEASURES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT
CONCLUSION--REPENT YE FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE
ONE CANNOT BELIEVE IN BOTH
BUT ALL THESE SUFFERINGS DO NOT COMPEL HIM TO CHANGE HIS RESOLUTION
AT A TABLE COVERED WITH BOTTLES WAS SITTING THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE EXPEDITION DRESSED IN HIS HALF-MILITARY UNIFORM AND EATING SOMETHING WHILE HE CHATTED TRANQUILLY ABOUT THE WEATHER WITH SOME ACQUAINTANCES HE HAD MET AS THOUGH THE BUSINESS HE WAS UPON WAS OF SO SIMPLE AND ORDINARY A CHARACTER THAT IT COULD NOT DISTURB HIS SERENITY AND HIS INTEREST IN THE CHANGE OF WEATHER
IN THE SAME WAY SINCE CHRIST'S TEACHING HAS BEEN KNOWN BY MEN THEY CANNOT SAY
AND THE SITUATION BECOMES MORE AND MORE INSUPPORTABLE
AND SECONDLY IN THOSE DAYS CASES OF REFUSAL TO WORSHIP THE GODS OR THE IMAGES OR THE POPE WERE NOT INCIDENTS THAT HAD ANY MATERIAL BEARING ON THE STATE
HE SAID
OTHERS MEANTIME WERE CROWDING INTO THE HALL OF THE RECRUITING OFFICE
IN REALITY THAT IS THE DOCTRINE--JUSTIFIED TO SOME BY THE THEORY OF THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE--WHICH REIGNS IN OUR SOCIETY
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE HIGHER CLASSES SUPPORT THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
MEN RESORTED TO VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS AND CONVINCED THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THAT THEY WERE DIRECTING THEIR VIOLENCE AGAINST EVIL RECOGNIZED AS SUCH BY ALL
YOUR HEALTH MY LADS
THERE CAN ONLY BE TWO SOLUTIONS
THE DISADVANTAGES FOR THE POOR MAN WHO SUBMITS WILL BE AGGRAVATED BY THE FACT THAT HE WILL BY TAKING PART IN IT AND AS IT WERE ASSENTING TO IT STRENGTHEN THE STATE OF SUBJECTION IN WHICH HE IS HELD HIMSELF
BUT ONLY LET ONE BEE SPREAD HER WINGS START OFF AND FLY AWAY AND AFTER HER ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THE CLINGING INERT CLUSTER WOULD BECOME A FREELY FLYING SWARM OF BEES
WHEN ANOTHER BENCH HAD BEEN BROUGHT THEY AGAIN MADE HIM LIE DOWN AND THE CONVICTED THIEVES AGAIN BEGAN TO FLOG HIM
CHRISTIANITY IS AT ONCE A DOCTRINE OF TRUTH AND A PROPHECY
AND LET IT NOT BE SAID THAT THE ONE DOES NOT HINDER THE OTHER THAT THESE OUGHT YE TO HAVE DONE AND NOT TO LEAVE THE OTHER UNDONE ALL THEREFORE WHATSOEVER THEY BID YOU OBSERVE THAT OBSERVE AND DO
ARE YOU DOING WHAT HE DEMANDS OF YOU WHO HAS SENT YOU INTO THE WORLD AND TO WHOM YOU WILL SOON RETURN
EVERYONE FEELS IT IN HIS WHOLE BEING
THE GOVERNOR ASKED FOR A TROOP OF SOLDIERS
BUT I AM A CITIZEN OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE UNITED STATES
AND YOU WILL SEE THAT FAR AS THEIR SOCIAL LIFE BASED ON VIOLENCE MAY BE FROM REALIZING CHRISTIAN TRUTH IN THEIR PRIVATE LIFE WHAT IS CONSIDERED GOOD BY ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION IS NOTHING BUT THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE THOSE WARRIORS THAT PROVES THE LEAST INTELLIGENCE
AND THIS NECESSITY FOR LOVE OF WHAT AWAKENS NO KIND OF SENTIMENT IN A MAN IS A CONTRADICTION WHICH CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THE SOCIAL THEORY OF LIFE
THEN THE OUTWARD CONDITION OF CRUELTY AND OF SLAVERY WAS IN COMPLETE HARMONY WITH THE INNER CONSCIENCE OF MEN AND EVERY STEP IN ADVANCE INTENSIFIED THIS HARMONY
CHRISTIANITY DESTROYS THE STATE--BUT WHICH IS MOST NECESSARY
I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DO WITH WAR--THE CRIMINAL LAW OF HUMANITY--AS WITH ALL OUR CRIMINAL LAWS THAT IS SOFTEN THEM PUT THEM IN FORCE AS RARELY AS POSSIBLE
WOULD NOT ANY OTHER MAN THAN VICTOR HUGO HAVE BEEN EXILED FOR THAT MIGHTY CRY OF DELIVERANCE AND TRUTH
L'EGLISE EST UNE LIBRE ASSOCIATION
AND NOW IT HAS ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOME THE CHAMPION OF THE OPPRESSED--THE VERY OPPRESSED WHOM IT IS ITSELF OPPRESSING THE WEAKNESS OF THE USE OF VIOLENCE LIES IN THE FACT THAT ALL THE ARGUMENTS BROUGHT FORWARD BY OPPRESSORS IN THEIR OWN DEFENSE CAN WITH EVEN BETTER REASON BE ADVANCED AGAINST THEM
ALL THE ACTS OF INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY WHICH ARE COMMITTED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF DAILY LIFE HAVE ONLY BECOME HABITUAL BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE MEN ALWAYS READY TO CARRY OUT SUCH ACTS OF INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY
ALL UNEASINESS ON THESE POINTS MAY BE REMOVED BY THE REFLECTION THAT NOTHING TRUE AND GOOD CAN BE DESTROYED BY THE REALIZATION OF TRUTH BUT WILL ONLY BE FREED FROM THE ALLOY OF FALSEHOOD
THIS WAS NOT DONE IN A SINGLE CRITICISM
THEY KNOW THAT THE LANDOWNERS ALWAYS OPPRESS THEIR BROTHERS THE PEASANTS AND THAT THEREFORE IT IS MOST LIKELY THE SAME THING HERE
ONE CAN SEE BY THE GOSPELS THE ACTS AND THE EPISTLES HOW FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES THE NON-COMPREHENSION OF THE DOCTRINE CALLED FORTH THE NEED FOR PROOFS THROUGH THE MIRACULOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE
IN WARFARE MEN HAVE IN ALL THE TOIL AND DANGERS THEY ENDURE NO OTHER PLEASURE THAN THAT OF BEING CONQUERORS NO SORROW OTHER THAN THAT OF BEING CONQUERED
IT WAS EVEN NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE ATTITUDE OF SUCH MEN MONSTROUS IRRATIONAL AND SUSPICIOUS A HOST OF ORATORS AND WRITERS OUR AUTHOR TELLS US AROSE TO OPPOSE THIS ATTITUDE AND TRIED TO PROVE THE SINFULNESS OF NON-RESISTANCE BOTH FROM SCRIPTURE AND ON COMMON-SENSE GROUNDS
WHY DO RICH MEN OF INDEPENDENT POSITION CONSIDER IT AN HONOR TO PERFORM A VALET'S DUTIES IN ATTENDANCE ON CROWNED PERSONAGES FLATTERING THEM AND CRINGING TO THEM AND PRETENDING TO BELIEVE IN THEIR PECULIAR SUPERIORITY
THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS THAT IT IS NOT ALL PEOPLE WHO DO TOLERATE IT SOME--THE GREATER PROPORTION--DELUDED AND SUBMISSIVE HAVE NO CHOICE AND HAVE TO TOLERATE ANYTHING IT IS TOLERATED BY THOSE WHO ONLY UNDER SUCH AN ORGANIZATION CAN OCCUPY A POSITION OF PROFIT
MEN HAVE TALKED AND STILL TALK OF DISARMAMENT WHILE DISARMAMENT IS SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE TO WHICH EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE WE OUGHT NOT TO CONSENT
A THIRD SECTION WHO DO NOT ADMIT THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST HOLD THAT THE SALVATION OF MANKIND WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY SLOW AND GRADUAL PROGRESS THROUGH WHICH THE PAGAN PRINCIPLES OF OUR EXISTENCE WILL BE REPLACED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY--THAT IS BY CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES
WITHOUT THE CONVICTION THAT THERE ARE PERSONS OF A HIGHER GRADE WHO WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND PEOPLE OF A LOWER GRADE WHO REQUIRE SUCH ACTS FOR THEIR WELFARE NOT ONE OF THE INTERMEDIATE CLASS WOULD SUPERINTEND SUCH DEEDS
THAT WAS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE INSTANCE BEFORE US
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND CANNOT BUT BE INSTITUTIONS NOT ONLY ALIEN IN SPIRIT TO CHRIST'S TEACHING BUT EVEN DIRECTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO IT
MASSACRES OF MEN
11
AND TO PREFER SUFFERING TO USING FORCE MEANS TO BE GOOD OR AT LEAST LESS WICKED THAN THOSE WHO DO UNTO OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE THEMSELVES
THE DAY OF THE PROCESSION COMES IN WHICH THE EMPEROR IS TO GO OUT IN HIS NEW CLOTHES
THE IDEAL IS NEVER FOR ANY PURPOSE TO USE FORCE
IN POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS IT IS MAINTAINED THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEANS OF DESTRUCTION THE MULTIPLICATION OF ARMAMENTS WILL LEAD TO THE NECESSITY OF MAKING WAR BY MEANS OF CONGRESSES ARBITRATION AND SO ON
A BRUISED REED SHALL HE NOT BREAK AND SMOKING FLAX SHALL HE NOT QUENCH TILL HE SEND FORTH JUDGMENT UNTO VICTORY MATT
THERE TOO A WOMAN IN REED SHOES AND PANYOVA JUST LIKE THE MOTHER LEFT AT HOME
THE FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUAL MEN IN THE NAME OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE FROM STATE DOMINATION WHICH WAS FORMERLY AN EXCEPTIONAL AND UNNOTICED PHENOMENON HAS OF LATE ACQUIRED THREATENING SIGNIFICANCE FOR STATE AUTHORITIES
IT IS A CASE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED FOR BY THE LAWS
AND PEACEABLE MEN LET THEMSELVES BE PLAYED ON THUS AND GO AND FALL ON ONE ANOTHER WITH THE FEROCITY OF WILD BEASTS
THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE AN END OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE UNANSWERABLE EXCEPT THAT THERE EXISTS ANOTHER LIVING MEANS OF SETTLING IT BEYOND DISPUTE
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
BUT THIS IS JUST WHAT WANTS PROVING
REGARD TO MILITARY SERVICE--CONSCRIPTION
WE CONCEIVE THAT A NATION HAS NO RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST FOREIGN ENEMIES OR TO PUNISH ITS INVADERS AND NO INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES THAT RIGHT IN HIS OWN CASE AND THE UNIT CANNOT BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN THE AGGREGATE
IT WAS FOR THAT CAUSE THAT CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED
MEN LOOK AT THE SUBJECT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW BUT ALL ALIKE TALK OF WAR AS THOUGH IT WERE SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY INDEPENDENT OF THE WILL OF THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN IT
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SACRED LAWS OF THE WORLD
THE FIRST HALF OF THE PROPHECY HAS BEEN FULFILLED IN THE GENERATION OF MEN WHO HAVE NOT ACCEPTED CHRIST'S TEACHING THEIR DESCENDANTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT NOW TO THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF PATTING THE TRUTH OF THE SECOND HALF TO THE TEST OF EXPERIENCE
BUT THE HYPOCRISY OF OUR SOCIETY FAR SURPASSES THE COMPARATIVELY INNOCENT HYPOCRISY OF THE PHARISEES
SELL THAT YE HAVE AND GIVE ALMS
MEANTIME GO AND PUT ON YOUR UNIFORM AND PREPARE TO CAUSE SUFFERING AND TO ENDURE IT FOR OUR BENEFIT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S LINE OF ARGUMENT
THESE INSTITUTIONS THEREFORE SERVE NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO PROVIDE A MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD FOR MEN WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING MORE USEFUL
SO THAT NO INSTITUTION HAVING AN EXTERNAL EXISTENCE CAN CORRESPOND TO THIS IDEA FOR LUTHERANS THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH A BODY OF MEN WHO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE AND LUTHER'S CATECHISM
THEY AS CHRISTIANS REGARD IT AS SINFUL AND IMMORAL TO HAVE ANY HAND IN SUCH DEEDS
SUCH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE VISIBLE IN EVERY UTTERANCE OF THE GOSPEL
THE CHURCHES ARE BEFORE US TO-DAY AND WE CAN JUDGE OF THEM TO SOME PURPOSE BY THEIR PRACTICAL ACTIVITY THEIR INFLUENCE ON MEN
THE MOTOR POWER OF HIS LIFE IS LOVE
WE SHALL ALWAYS LIVE UNDER THE BURDEN OF THE ANCIENT AND ODIOUS CUSTOMS THE CRIMINAL PREJUDICES THE FEROCIOUS IDEAS OF OUR BARBAROUS ANCESTORS FOR WE ARE BEASTS AND BEASTS WE SHALL REMAIN DOMINATED BY INSTINCT AND CHANGED BY NOTHING
IF CHRISTIANS AND PREACHERS OF CHRISTIANITY DO NOT DO SO THERE MUST BE REASONS FOR IT
ACCORDING TO THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT MAN IS LIVING IN THE TRUTH WHO HAS TRANSPORTED HIS LIFE TO THE DOMAIN IN WHICH IT IS FREE--THE DOMAIN OF CAUSES THAT IS THE KNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNITION THE PROFESSION AND REALIZATION IN LIFE OF REVEALED TRUTH
CONSTANTINE IN HIS TURN ENDOWED THE POPE WITH WORLDLY RICHES AND POWER
AND--THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION HANGING OVER THE HEADS OF ALL OF US IN THESE DAYS OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE--CAN THE CHRISTIAN OR CAN HE NOT REMAINING A CHRISTIAN AGAINST CHRIST'S DIRECT PROHIBITION PROMISE OBEDIENCE IN FUTURE ACTIONS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO HIS TEACHING
THOSE ARE WICKED WHO EXALT THEMSELVES OPPRESS STRIVE AND USE FORCE
IF THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WERE SO DISUNITED WHEN THEY HAD SO LITTLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS THAT THEY COULD NOT CO-OPERATE AND AGREE TOGETHER IN ANY COMMON ACTION IN COMMERCE ECONOMICS OR EDUCATION WITHOUT THE STATE AS A CENTER THIS WANT OF COMMON ACTION EXISTS NO LONGER
FOR IT WOULD AMOUNT TO NOTHING LESS THAN DEPRIVING CHRISTIANITY OF ALL DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER AND THOUGH HE TELLS US THAT AFTER CONSTANTINE'S TIME THE CHURCH DID ACTUALLY ABUSE ITS POWER BY DESIGNATING THOSE WHO DISSENTED FROM IT AS HERETICS AND PERSECUTING THEM YET HE SAYS WHEN SPEAKING OF EARLY TIMES
THE ESSENCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIFE TO THE LIFE OF SOCIETIES OF INDIVIDUALS
AND BY NO MEANS TO DIMINISH THE DEMANDS EITHER OF THE IDEAL ITSELF OR OF THE PRECEPTS AS PEOPLE IMAGINE WHO JUDGE IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE
TO LET A MAN ALONE WHO HAS REFUSED OBEDIENCE IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE
WAS REMOVED AND ROBESPIERRE CAME TO POWER AND AFTERWARD NAPOLEON--WHO RULED THEN A BETTER MAN OR A WORSE
JUST AS A SINGLE SHOCK MAY BE SUFFICIENT WHEN A LIQUID IS SATURATED WITH SOME SALT TO PRECIPITATE IT AT ONCE IN CRYSTALS A SLIGHT EFFORT MAY BE PERHAPS ALL THAT IS NEEDED NOW THAT THE TRUTH ALREADY REVEALED TO MEN MAY GAIN A MASTERY OVER HUNDREDS THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF MEN THAT A PUBLIC OPINION CONSISTENT WITH CONSCIENCE MAY BE ESTABLISHED AND THROUGH THIS CHANGE OF PUBLIC OPINION THE WHOLE ORDER OF LIFE MAY BE TRANSFORMED
THE REASON FOR THEIR EXPEDITION WAS AS FOLLOWS
FOR THEY SOW NOT NEITHER DO THEY REAP NOR GATHER INTO BARNS
SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS NOT ONLY A LIMITATION BUT A DIRECT CONTRADICTION AND NEGATION OF THE COMMANDMENT
BESIDES IF CHRIST HAD REALLY FOUNDED SUCH AN INSTITUTION AS THE CHURCH FOR THE FOUNDATION OF ALL HIS TEACHING AND THE WHOLE FAITH HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DESCRIBED THIS INSTITUTION CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE ONLY TRUE CHURCH BESIDES TALES OF MIRACLES WHICH ARE USED TO SUPPORT EVERY KIND OF SUPERSTITION SOME TOKENS SO UNMISTAKABLE THAT NO DOUBT OF ITS GENUINENESS COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN
THE OFFICER WAS BORED HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
SINCE EVERY THEOLOGICAL WORK DEALS WITH THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ERRONEOUS DOCTRINES WHICH SURROUND IT THAT IS HERESIES
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS IS NOTHING BUT THE HISTORY OF THIS GRADUAL CHANGE OF RELATION BETWEEN THE MORAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASSES ON THE ONE HAND AND THE DEMORALIZATION OF GOVERNMENTS ON THE OTHER
THE PHILANTHROPY OF THE RICH AND THEIR LIFE WHICH PRODUCES THE POOR THEY ARE BENEFITING
THE CONDITION AND ORGANIZATION OF OUR SOCIETY ARE TERRIBLE BUT THEY REST ONLY ON PUBLIC OPINION AND CAN BE DESTROYED BY IT--ALREADY VIOLENCE IS REGARDED FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW
EVERYWHERE WE HEAR COMPLAINTS OF THE DEPRESSION OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURES AND THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THE ECONOMIC POSITION GENERALLY THE MISERABLE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE OF THE WORKING CLASSES AND THE UNIVERSAL IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE MASSES
THEY SUPPORT AND REST ON ONE ANOTHER AND INCLOSE ALL THAT LIES WITHIN THE RING
BUT IT WAS JUST THE SAME THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO WITH EVERY SOCIAL OR EVEN FAMILY DUTY SUCH AS THE DUTY OF PARENTS TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN OF THE YOUNG TO MAINTAIN THE OLD OF FIDELITY IN MARRIAGE
AND SO THIS GOVERNOR--PRECISELY AS THE GOVERNOR OF TOULA WAS DOING ON THAT DAY--WITH A BATTALION OF SOLDIERS WITH GUNS AND RODS HASTILY BROUGHT TOGETHER BY MEANS OF TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES AND RAILWAYS PROCEEDED BY A SPECIAL TRAIN TO THE SCENE OF ACTION WITH A LEARNED DOCTOR WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO INSURE THE FLOGGING BEING OF AN HYGIENIC CHARACTER
AND WHEN WERE BETTER MEN IN POWER WHEN THE VERSAILLIST PARTY OR WHEN THE COMMUNE WAS IN POWER
THE QUAKERS SENT ME BOOKS FROM WHICH I LEARNT HOW THEY HAD YEARS AGO ESTABLISHED BEYOND DOUBT THE DUTY FOR A CHRISTIAN OF FULFILLING THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE AND HAD EXPOSED THE ERROR OF THE CHURCH'S TEACHING IN ALLOWING WAR AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
HENCE WE SHALL ORGANIZE PUBLIC LECTURES CIRCULATE TRACTS AND PUBLICATIONS FORM SOCIETIES AND PETITION EVERY GOVERNING BODY
IF THE MORE OR LESS GOOD AND THE MORE OR LESS BAD CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE HEATHEN WORLD THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF GOOD AND EVIL HAS SO CLEARLY DEFINED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GOOD AND THE WICKED THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFOUND THEM
THERE ARE ALREADY MEN WHO VOLUNTARILY ABANDON THESE PROFESSIONS WHICH WERE ONCE RECKONED IRREPROACHABLE AND PREFER LESS LUCRATIVE CALLINGS WHICH ARE IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF FORCE
NOW NOT ONLY THE MINORITY WHO HAVE ALWAYS COMPREHENDED CHRISTIANITY BY SPIRITUAL INTUITION BUT ALL THE VAST MAJORITY WHO SEEM SO FAR FROM IT IN THEIR SOCIAL EXISTENCE RECOGNIZE ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE
WHAT IS THE USE OF THE CLERGY WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY PREACH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE EITHER OF THESE CONTENTIONS BY ABSTRACT REASONING
AND ALREADY THIS CHANGE IS BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE
NATIONS CANNOT ENDURE THE CONSTANT INCREASE OF ARMIES FOR LONG AND SOONER OR LATER THEY WILL PREFER WAR TO ALL THE DISADVANTAGES OF THEIR PRESENT POSITION AND THE CONSTANT MENACE OF WAR
IN THE ACCOUNT OF IT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST PRECEDES THE ASSEMBLY BUT THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS WRITTEN MUCH LATER THAN BOTH EVENTS BUT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST TOO HAD TO BE PROVED FOR THOSE WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE TONGUES OF FIRE THOUGH IT IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY A TONGUE OF FIRE BURNING ABOVE A MAN'S HEAD SHOULD PROVE THAT WHAT THAT MAN IS GOING TO SAY WILL BE INFALLIBLY THE TRUTH AND SO AROSE THE NECESSITY FOR STILL MORE MIRACLES AND CHANGES RAISINGS OF THE DEAD TO LIFE AND STRIKINGS OF THE LIVING DEAD AND ALL THOSE MARVELS WHICH HAVE BEEN A STUMBLING-BLOCK TO MEN OF WHICH THE ACTS IS FULL AND WHICH FAR FROM EVER CONVINCING ONE OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE CAN ONLY REPEL MEN FROM IT
BUT TO PUT A MAN OPENLY TO DEATH BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN THE CREED WE ALL CONFESS IS IMPOSSIBLE
THE STATE THEY TELL US IS INDISPENSABLY NEEDED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT WE SHOULD NOT BE PROTECTED AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF EVIL-DISPOSED PERSONS
YET THEY ARE ALL GOING TO KILL THE PEASANTS TO SECURE THREE THOUSAND RUBLES FOR THE LANDOWNER ONLY BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT THEY FANCY THEMSELVES NOT MEN BUT GOVERNOR OFFICIAL GENERAL OF POLICE OFFICER AND SOLDIER RESPECTIVELY AND CONSIDER THEMSELVES BOUND TO OBEY NOT THE ETERNAL DEMANDS OF THE CONSCIENCE OF MAN BUT THE CASUAL TEMPORARY DEMANDS OF THEIR POSITIONS AS OFFICERS OR SOLDIERS
DISARMAMENT IMPOSED ON ONE NATION BY ANOTHER IN CIRCUMSTANCES THREATENING ITS SECURITY WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO A DECLARATION OF WAR
ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHETHER YOU PROFESS THE TRUTH REVEALED TO YOU AND THEREFORE REALIZE IT IN YOUR LIFE OR AT LEAST REFRAIN FROM COMMITTING ACTIONS OPPOSED TO THE TRUTH SUCH AS SERVING THE GOVERNMENT AND STRENGTHENING ITS AUTHORITY WHEN YOU REGARD IT AS INJURIOUS PROFITING BY THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM WHEN YOU REGARD IT AS WRONG SHOWING VENERATION FOR VARIOUS CEREMONIES WHICH YOU BELIEVE TO BE DEGRADING SUPERSTITIONS GIVING SUPPORT TO THE LAW WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT TO BE FOUNDED ON ERROR SERVING AS A SOLDIER TAKING OATHS AND LYING AND LOWERING YOURSELF GENERALLY
THEY NEED SPECIAL SUPERNATURAL EFFORTS
IF A MAN BELIEVES IN THE NICENE CREED THAT IS IN THE CHURCH THAT IS IN THOSE WHO CALL THEMSELVES ITS REPRESENTATIVES THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT BECOMES SUPERFLUOUS FOR HIM
THEY KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS WRONG AND WOULD NOT DO IT FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD IF THEY HAD THE POWER OF RESISTING THE FORCES WHICH SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THEIR ACTIONS AND IMPEL THEM TO COMMIT THEM
TO PUNISH MEN FOR REFUSING TO ACT AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE THE GOVERNMENT MUST RENOUNCE ALL CLAIM TO GOOD SENSE AND BENEVOLENCE
WHAT IS TO DONE WITH SUCH PEOPLE
SECOND EMBRACING THE SOCIETY OR THE PAGAN VIEW OF LIFE
AND IF THERE IS NO NEED TO IMPRISON BEAT AND KILL MEN EVERY TIME THE LANDLORD COLLECTS HIS RENTS EVERY TIME THOSE WHO ARE IN WANT OF BREAD HAVE TO PAY A SWINDLING MERCHANT THREE TIMES ITS VALUE EVERY TIME THE FACTORY HAND HAS TO BE CONTENT WITH A WAGE LESS THAN HALF OF THE PROFIT MADE BY THE EMPLOYER AND EVERY TIME A POOR MAN PAYS HIS LAST RUBLE IN TAXES IT IS BECAUSE SO MANY MEN HAVE BEEN BEATEN AND KILLED FOR TRYING TO RESIST THESE DEMANDS THAT THE LESSON HAS NOW BEEN LEARNT VERY THOROUGHLY
THE CONVENTIONAL POSITIONS ESTABLISHED HUNDREDS OF YEARS RECOGNIZED FOR CENTURIES AND BY EVERYONE DISTINGUISHED BY SPECIAL NAMES AND DRESSES AND MOREOVER CONFIRMED BY EVERY KIND OF SOLEMNITY HAVE SO PENETRATED INTO MEN'S MINDS THROUGH THEIR SENSES THAT FORGETTING THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF LIFE COMMON TO ALL THEY LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND EVERYONE ONLY FROM THIS CONVENTIONAL POINT OF VIEW AND ARE GUIDED IN THEIR ESTIMATION OF THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND THOSE OF OTHERS BY THIS CONVENTIONAL STANDARD
A YOUNG MAN COMES IN WRETCHEDLY SHABBILY DRESSED AND IN TERROR THE MUSCLES OF HIS FACE WORKING HIS EYES BRIGHT AND RESTLESS
I HARDLY THINK THAT HE WILL HAVE TO REPEAT THE COMPLAINT IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT VOLUME
THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH SUCH REMARKS WERE NOT WORTH ANSWERING
THE LEARNED MEN FORM SOCIETIES THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SUCH SOCIETIES ASSEMBLE IN CONGRESSES SUCH AS THOSE RECENTLY HELD IN LONDON AND PARIS AND SHORTLY TO BE HELD IN ROME DELIVER ADDRESSES EAT PUBLIC DINNERS AND MAKE SPEECHES PUBLISH JOURNALS AND PROVE BY EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE THAT THE NATIONS FORCED TO SUPPORT MILLIONS OF TROOPS ARE STRAINED TO THE FURTHEST LIMITS OF THEIR ENDURANCE THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE HUGE ARMED FORCES IS IN OPPOSITION TO ALL THE AIMS THE INTERESTS AND THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE MOREOVER BY WRITING NUMEROUS PAPERS AND UTTERING A GREAT MANY WORDS TO BRING ALL MEN INTO AGREEMENT AND TO ARRANGE SO THAT THEY SHALL HAVE NO ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS AND THEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR
I HAVE TALKED TO SOLDIERS WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THESE CRIMES AND THEY ALWAYS STUDIOUSLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION OFF THE SUBJECT AND WHEN THEY SPOKE OF IT IT WAS WITH HORROR AND BEWILDERMENT
THESE COMMANDMENTS ARE AS IT WERE SIGNPOSTS ON THE ENDLESS ROAD TO PERFECTION TOWARD WHICH HUMANITY IS MOVING SHOWING THE POINT OF PERFECTION WHICH IS POSSIBLE AT A CERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY
THIS HYPOTHESIS ORIGINATED FROM MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE TEACHING AND ITS RESULT WAS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND IT RIGHTLY
AND THERE CAN ONLY BE A SEMBLANCE OF ETHICS IN WHICH MURDER IN THE SHAPE OF WAR AND THE EXECUTION OF CRIMINALS IS ALLOWED BUT NO TRUE ETHICS
IF WE MUST NOT OPPOSE EVIL BY FORCE NOR SWEAR EVERYONE NATURALLY ASKS HOW THEN ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE
AND THE LEARNED GENTLEMEN WHO GET UP CONGRESSES AND WRITE ARTICLES ARE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT WITH IT
MEN WHO ARE USED TO THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS WHO LIKE IT AND DREAD ITS BEING CHANGED TRY TO TAKE THE DOCTRINE AS A COLLECTION OF REVELATIONS AND RULES WHICH ONE CAN ACCEPT WITHOUT THEIR MODIFYING ONE'S LIFE
IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS PRESENTED TO MEN OF THE SOCIAL OR HEATHEN THEORY OF LIFE TO-DAY IN THE GUISE OF A SUPERNATURAL RELIGION THOUGH THERE IS IN REALITY NOTHING MYSTERIOUS MYSTIC OR SUPERNATURAL ABOUT IT
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS--AND YET EVERY MORNING A BROTHER OR A SISTER MUST EMPTY THE BEDROOM SLOPS FOR ME
LESS EVEN THAN THAT IS NECESSARY
XIX
AND BESIDES THE FACT THAT THE CLASS FROM WHICH THE SERVANTS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE WEALTHY ARE DRAWN GROWS LESS IN NUMBER AND LOWER IN CALIBER THEY NO LONGER THEMSELVES ATTACH THE SAME IMPORTANCE TO THEIR POSITIONS AS THEY ONCE DID
STATE RELIGIONS DEIFIED EMPERORS AND STATES
DENY THYSELF TAKE UP THY CROSS EACH DAY AND FOLLOW ME
FOR THE MAN WHO PROMISES UNCONDITIONAL OBEDIENCE IN THE FUTURE TO LAWS MADE OR TO BE MADE BY THAT VERY PROMISE IS IN THE MOST POSITIVE MANNER RENOUNCING CHRISTIANITY WHICH MEANS OBEYING IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF LIFE ONLY THE DIVINE LAW OF LOVE HE RECOGNIZES WITHIN HIM
THE WORKINGMEN AND THE POOR WOULD BE WRONG IF THEY TRIED TO DO SO IN A WORLD IN WHICH SLAVES AND MASTERS WERE REGARDED AS DIFFERENT SPECIES CREATED BY GOD
FOR THE GREEK ORTHODOX BELIEVER THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PRIESTHOOD OF RUSSIA
I SHOULD RUN HIM THROUGH WITH MY BAYONET HE ANSWERED WITH THE FOOLISH INTONATION PECULIAR TO SOLDIERS
MEANTIME THE CROWD OF FATHERS MOTHERS AND WIVES HUSTLED BY THE POLICE ARE PRESSING ROUND THE DOORS TO HEAR WHOSE LAD HAS BEEN TAKEN WHOSE IS LET OFF
IN THE SAME WAY THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ANCIENT HEATHEN LIFE AND THE LIFE OF TO-DAY IS MERELY EXTERNAL
WISER RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON THESE DUELS BETWEEN NATIONS MIGHT HOWEVER AT LEAST LIMIT ITS HORRORS
AND SINCE THIS WILL EITHER NEVER BE OR AT LEAST CANNOT BE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL CHRISTIANS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY IT OUGHT TO BE MAINTAINED IN THE INTERESTS OF THE MAJORITY
IT MAY SUBJECT US TO INSULT OUTRAGE SUFFERING YEA EVEN DEATH ITSELF
WITH THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE LOVE IS NOT A NECESSITY AND IS CONFINED TO NO OBJECT
A GROUP OF TWENTY MEN WAS NO OBSTRUCTION TO ANYONE BUT HE HAD BEEN STANDING THERE THE WHOLE MORNING AND HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
IT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE CUSTOM OF OUR SOCIETY WERE WHAT IS OR RATHER IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CUSTOM IN CHINA
THE ALABAMA QUESTION WAS DECIDED BY A COURT OF ARBITRATION AND THE QUESTION OF THE CAROLINE ISLANDS WAS SUBMITTED TO THE DECISION OF THE POPE
E CROSS HIMSELF
33-34
AND SO IT IS WITH MAN
THIRDLY EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH THE WICKED FROM THE GOOD UNFAILINGLY EVEN THEN IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL OR INJURE OR SHUT UP IN PRISON THESE WICKED MEN BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO ONE IN A CHRISTIAN SOCIETY TO CARRY OUT SUCH PUNISHMENT SINCE EVERY CHRISTIAN AS A CHRISTIAN HAS BEEN COMMANDED TO USE NO FORCE AGAINST THE WICKED
THE POWER OF EVERY BRIGAND CHIEF IS AT LEAST SO FAR LIMITED THAT THE MEN OF HIS BAND PRESERVE AT LEAST SOME HUMAN LIBERTY AND CAN REFUSE TO COMMIT ACTS OPPOSED TO THEIR CONSCIENCE
AND 5 OF THE OBJECT AND RESULT OF MAKING HERETICS
THE PRECEPT SHOWING THE LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CANNOT FALL IS THAT OF RETURNING GOOD FOR EVIL BEING PATIENT UNDER WRONG GIVING THE CLOAK ALSO
CONSCRIPTS HE SAID YOU HAVE SWORN FIDELITY TO ME BEFORE THE ALTAR AND THE MINISTER OF GOD
AND THERE HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS EACH CALLING ITSELF THE TRUE CHURCH
OR IF A SOLDIER ON WHOM ALL THE SYSTEM OF VIOLENCE IS BASED TO REFUSE IMMEDIATELY TO OBEY IN SPITE OF ALL THE DANGERS OF INSUBORDINATION
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS THEY BELIEVE NOW WILL BE SAID IN ANSWER TO THIS
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT UNDER A DESPOTIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT THE AUTHORITY IS CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF OPPRESSORS AND VIOLENCE TAKES A CRUDER FORM
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CHRIST GIVE THEIR BLESSING TO THE RANKS OF MURDERERS HOLDING THEIR GUNS LOADED AGAINST THEIR BROTHERS
AND THEY ACTUALLY ARE READY
AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE MEN READY TO KILL OR TORTURE ANYONE AT THEIR COMMANDER'S WILL NO ONE WOULD DARE TO CLAIM AS ALL THE IDLE LANDOWNERS CLAIM WITH SUCH ASSURANCE THAT A PIECE OF LAND SURROUNDED BY PEASANTS WHO ARE IN WRETCHEDNESS FROM WANT OF LAND IS THE PROPERTY OF A MAN WHO DOES NOT CULTIVATE IT OR THAT STORES OF CORN TAKEN BY SWINDLING FROM THE PEASANTS OUGHT TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED IN THE MIDST OF A POPULATION DYING OF HUNGER BECAUSE THE MERCHANTS MUST MAKE THEIR PROFIT
MY BOOK RECEIVED PRECISELY THE SAME TREATMENT AS ALL THE ATTACKS UPON THE TEACHERS OF THE CHURCH FOR THEIR DEFECTION FROM THE LAW OF CHRIST OF WHICH HISTORY FROM THE DAYS OF CONSTANTINE IS FULL
IT IS AMAZING HOW MEN CAN DECEIVE THEMSELVES WHEN THEY FIND IT NECESSARY
AND SHOULD THINK THEY OUGHT TO FIND SOME MEANS BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY FOR EVERY SEPARATE BEE TO SPREAD HER WINGS AND FLY OFF BUT BY WHICH THE WHOLE SWARM COULD FLY AT ONCE WHERE IT WANTED TO
THE THIRD KIND OF ANSWER STILL MORE SUBTLE THAN THE PRECEDING CONSISTS IN ASSERTING THAT THOUGH THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE IS BINDING ON THE CHRISTIAN WHEN THE EVIL IS DIRECTED AGAINST HIMSELF PERSONALLY IT CEASES TO BE BINDING WHEN THE EVIL IS DIRECTED AGAINST HIS NEIGHBORS AND THAT THEN THE CHRISTIAN IS NOT ONLY NOT BOUND TO FULFILL THE COMMANDMENT BUT IS EVEN BOUND TO ACT IN OPPOSITION TO IT IN DEFENSE OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND TO USE FORCE AGAINST TRANSGRESSORS BY FORCE
AND YET FOR MORE THAN FOUR CENTURIES IT HAS REMAINED UNPRINTED AND IS STILL UNKNOWN EXCEPT TO A FEW LEARNED SPECIALISTS
WHY IS IT THAT ONE MAN TEN A HUNDRED MAY NOT BREAK THE LAW OF GOD BUT A GREAT NUMBER MAY AND HERE IS A VERSION OF BALLOU'S CATECHISM COMPOSED FOR HIS FLOCK
HE THAT KILLETH ANY MAN SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH
NOT IN VAIN HAVE THE BEST MEN OF CHRISTIAN HUMANITY WHO APPREHENDED THE TRUTH BY SPIRITUAL INTUITION FOR EIGHTEEN CENTURIES TESTIFIED TO IT IN SPITE OF EVERY MENACE EVERY PRIVATION AND EVERY SUFFERING
THERE ARE STILL THE SAME PARLIAMENTS WITH THE SAME DEBATES ON THE EASTERN QUESTION AND AFRICA ON TREATIES AND VIOLATIONS OF TREATIES AND HOME RULE AND THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY
EITHER TO FIND A REAL UNQUESTIONABLE CRITERION OF WHAT IS EVIL OR NOT TO RESIST EVIL BY FORCE
HE BEGAN TO CUT DOWN THE TREES BUT THE PEASANTS UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH OBVIOUS INJUSTICE COULD BE DONE THEM BY THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES DID NOT SUBMIT TO THE DECISION AND DROVE AWAY THE MEN SENT TO CUT DOWN THE TREES DECLARING THAT THE FOREST BELONGED TO THEM AND THEY WOULD GO TO THE TZAR BEFORE THEY WOULD LET THEM CUT IT DOWN
OR WHAT IS STILL MORE STRIKING A YOUNG MAN PERFECTLY SANE IN EVERY OTHER MATTER INDEPENDENT AND BEYOND THE FEAR OF WANT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN APPOINTED JUDICIAL PROSECUTOR OR DISTRICT COMMANDER SEPARATES A POOR WIDOW FROM HER LITTLE CHILDREN AND SHUTS HER UP IN PRISON LEAVING HER CHILDREN UNCARED FOR ALL BECAUSE THE UNHAPPY WOMAN CARRIED ON A SECRET TRADE IN SPIRITS AND SO DEPRIVED THE REVENUE OF TWENTY-FIVE RUBLES AND HE DOES NOT FEEL THE LEAST PANG OF REMORSE
SO THAT HOMYAKOV'S ASSERTION THAT THIS CHURCH UNITED BY LOVE AND CONSEQUENTLY HOLY IS THE SAME CHURCH AS THE GREEK ORTHODOX PRIESTHOOD PROFESS FAITH IN IS EVEN MORE ARBITRARY THAN THE ASSERTIONS OF THE CATHOLICS OR THE ORTHODOX
I AM CONSIDERING IT AT THIS MOMENT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF UNIVERSAL HUMANITY AND MAKING NO REFERENCE TO OUR MISUNDERSTANDING WITH GERMANY--A MOST TRIVIAL INCIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND
OTHERS--THE MAJORITY--ONLY THROUGH A LONG COURSE OF MISTAKES EXPERIMENTS AND SUFFERING ARE BROUGHT TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH OF THE DOCTRINE AND THE NECESSITY OF ADOPTING IT
AND I DO NOT FOR THAT CEASE TO BE A CHRISTIAN
IL Y A TOUT PROFIT A SE SEPARER D'ELLE
19 20 THE CHRISTIAN WILL NOT DISPUTE WITH ANYONE NOR ATTACK ANYONE NOR USE VIOLENCE AGAINST ANYONE
BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT OUT OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF CRITICS OF MY BOOK THERE WAS NOT ONE EITHER RUSSIAN OR FOREIGN WHO TREATED THE SUBJECT FROM THE SIDE FROM WHICH IT WAS APPROACHED IN THE BOOK--THAT IS WHO CRITICISED CHRIST'S DOCTRINES AS PHILOSOPHICAL MORAL AND SOCIAL PRINCIPLES TO USE THEIR SCIENTIFIC EXPRESSIONS
OR IF THEY WANT TO TREAT THEM INDULGENTLY THEY CONDESCEND FROM THE HEIGHT OF THEIR SUPERIORITY TO CORRECT THEM ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT CHRIST MEANT TO EXPRESS PRECISELY THEIR OWN IDEAS BUT DID NOT SUCCEED IN DOING SO
BUT TRY THE EXPERIMENT OF SAYING A DISRESPECTFUL WORD ABOUT A HIDEOUS IDOL WHICH IS CARRIED SACRILEGIOUSLY ABOUT MOSCOW BY DRUNKEN MEN UNDER THE NAME OF THE IKON OF THE IVERSKY VIRGIN AND YOU WILL RAISE A GROAN OF INDIGNATION FROM THESE SAME CHURCHMEN
THESE PURSUITS ARE FOLLOWED UP AS AN IMPORTANT SERIOUS BUSINESS
THE ATTITUDE OF THE RULING CLASSES TO THE LABORERS IS THAT OF A MAN WHO HAS FELLED HIS ADVERSARY TO THE EARTH AND HOLDS HIM DOWN NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HOLD HIM DOWN AS BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IF HE LET HIM GO EVEN FOR A SECOND HE WOULD HIMSELF BE STABBED FOR HIS ADVERSARY IS INFURIATED AND HAS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND
ALL THESE MEN ARE READY TO FACE ANY KIND OF PRIVATION SUFFERING OR DANGER RATHER THAN CONSENT TO DO WHAT THEY REGARD AS WRONG
THE AIM OF HIS LIFE IS HIS PERSONAL WELFARE
METHODS OF AIMING AT FREEDOM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM WHICH ARE NO HINDRANCE TO DESPOTISM
IF YOUR OFFICER COMMANDS YOU TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S CHILD TO KILL YOUR FATHER OR YOUR MOTHER WOULD YOU OBEY
CONSEQUENTLY THE CLASS FROM WHICH THE WEALTHY AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE DRAWN GROWS LESS IN NUMBER AND LOWER IN INTELLIGENCE AND EDUCATION AND STILL MORE IN MORAL QUALITIES
DU CAMP ARE AS FOLLOWS
WE ARE ALL CHRISTIAN NATIONS LIVING THE SAME SPIRITUAL LIFE SO THAT EVERY NOBLE AND PREGNANT THOUGHT SPRINGING UP AT ONE END OF THE WORLD IS AT ONCE COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE OF CHRISTIAN HUMANITY AND EVOKES EVERYWHERE THE SAME EMOTION AT PRIDE AND REJOICING WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF NATIONALITIES
32
IT SEEMS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF PROGRESS AND EVERY STEP IN ADVANCE THAT HUMANITY HAS TAKEN HITHERTO HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY BLOODSHED
AND THEREFORE EVEN IN THAT CASE IT IS BETTER TO RUN THE RISK OF THEIR BANISHING ME SHUTTING ME UP IN PRISON OR EXECUTING ME THAN OF MY LIVING ALL MY LIFE IN BONDAGE THROUGH MY OWN FAULT TO WICKED MEN
SCIENCE SHOWS IT ADVANCING TO PERFECTION THROUGH STRUGGLE AND VIOLENT SELECTION
THAT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD UNAIDED BY THE STATE THEY WILL MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY NEED AND THAT THEREFORE GOVERNMENT FAR FROM BEING ANY AID UNDER SHOW OF GUARDING MEN EXERTS A PERNICIOUS AND BRUTALIZING INFLUENCE OVER THEM
THEIR FATHERS ARE OLD AND POOR
THE INTERMEDIATE CLASS WHO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR SUPERIORS ON THE ONE HAND AND REGARD THEMSELVES AS SUPERIOR BEINGS ON THE OTHER ARE INTOXICATED BY POWER AND STUPEFIED BY SERVILITY AT THE SAME TIME AND SO LOSE THE SENSE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
THE GOVERNOR MUST HAVE GIVEN DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE RODS THE OFFICIALS MUST HAVE SENT AN ORDER FOR THEM PURCHASED THEM AND ENTERED THE ITEM IN THEIR ACCOUNTS
DUTY OF USING FORCE IN DEFENSE OF ONE'S NEIGHBOR--4TH REPLY
OFTEN THEY ARE ASHAMED OF THE IGNOMINY OF THEIR CALLING AND DO NOT PERFORM THE DUTIES THEY ARE BOUND TO PERFORM IN THEIR POSITION
A CHURCH IS A BODY OF MEN WHO ASSERT THAT THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF INFALLIBLE TRUTH
IT IS THE SAME WITH THE MASS OF MANKIND WHO NOT INDIVIDUALLY BUT ALWAYS IN A MASS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A NEW SOCIAL IDEA PASS ALL AT ONCE FROM ONE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE TO ANOTHER
AND FIFTHLY AND LASTLY MORE THAN ALL THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT YOU MAYBE ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BE READY DIRECTLY WE ORDER YOU TO DO SO TO REGARD THOSE WHOM WE INDICATE TO YOU AS YOUR ENEMIES
MOREOVER A MAJORITY OF THEM CAN NOW READ AND THE BOOKS THEY READ ARE NOT ALL SUCH AS EXALT A MILITARY LIFE
AND THIS IS NOT A REMOTE CONTINGENCY BUT THE VERY THING WE ARE ALL PREPARING FOR WHICH IS NOT ONLY PROBABLE BUT AN INEVITABLE CERTAINTY
THE WHOLE HISTORIC EXISTENCE OF MANKIND IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE GRADUAL TRANSITION FROM THE PERSONAL ANIMAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND FROM THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO THE DIVINE CONCEPTION OF LIFE
OFTEN TOO THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS DUELING
THERE IS NOT ONLY NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THE CHURCHES AS SUCH AND CHRISTIANITY EXCEPT THE NAME BUT THEY REPRESENT TWO PRINCIPLES FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED AND ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE ANOTHER
IT IS SHOWN BY THE WORDS HE UTTERED AT THE SAME TIME
IT WOULD BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS AS COMMUNISTS ADVOCATE TO REPLACE THE COMPETITIVE INDIVIDUALISTIC ORGANIZATION OF MEN'S ACTIVITY BY A SOCIAL UNIVERSAL ORGANIZATION SO THAT EACH WOULD BE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR EACH
IF THE WORLD WILL NOT LEAVE THEM IN PEACE THEY WILL GO ELSEWHERE SINCE THEY ARE PILGRIMS ON THE EARTH AND THEY HAVE NO FIXED PLACE OF HABITATION
INWARD MEANS THAT IS BY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH PROPHETIC INSIGHT AND RECOGNITION OF THE EMPTINESS OF POWER AND RENUNCIATION OF IT BY INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO BY ANOTHER EXTERNAL MEANS THE ACCEPTANCE OF A NEW TRUTH BY WHOLE MASSES OF MEN ON A LOWER LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SIMPLE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LEADERS--WHEN A CERTAIN STAGE IN THE DIFFUSION OF A TRUTH HAS BEEN REACHED A PUBLIC OPINION IS CREATED WHICH IMPELS A WHOLE MASS OF MEN FORMERLY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE NEW TRUTH TO ACCEPT IT--AND THEREFORE ALL MEN MAY QUICKLY BE BROUGHT TO RENOUNCE THE USE OF VIOLENCE WHEN ONCE A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION IS ESTABLISHED--THE CONVICTION OF FORCE BEING NECESSARY HINDERS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION--THE USE OF VIOLENCE LEADS MEN TO DISTRUST THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WHICH IS THE ONLY FORCE BY WHICH THEY ADVANCE--NEITHER NATIONS NOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN REALLY SUBJUGATED BY FORCE BUT ONLY BY PUBLIC OPINION WHICH NO FORCE CAN RESIST--SAVAGE NATIONS AND SAVAGE MEN CAN ONLY
CHURCHMEN MAY TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY TEACH BY EVERY MEANS IN THEIR POWER
SUDDENLY PEOPLE ARE TO BE FOUND IN VARIOUS PLACES DECLARING THAT TO CARRY A PASSPORT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT ONE OUGHT NOT TO RECOGNIZE ONE'S DEPENDENCE ON A STATE WHICH EXISTS BY MEANS OF FORCE
THEY COMPEL THE PEOPLE BY OVERAWING THEM TO BELIEVE IN THIS AND JEALOUSLY GUARD THIS FAITH FROM ANY ATTEMPT TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THESE BARBAROUS SUPERSTITIONS
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CHRIST MEANT TO SAY WHAT HE SAID
IT IS REPEATED IN PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE AND EVEN IN STATE TREATIES
1 DEATH WHICH MAY AT ANY MOMENT POUNCE UPON EACH OF US
TO SUBMIT MEANS TO PREFER SUFFERING TO USING FORCE
SO THAT THE VERY VIOLENCE WHICH THE CHAMPIONS OF GOVERNMENT HOLD UP AS A TERROR--PRETENDING THAT EXCEPT FOR ITS OPPRESSIVE POWER THE WICKED WOULD OPPRESS THE GOOD--HAS REALLY ALWAYS EXISTED AND WILL EXIST IN HUMAN SOCIETY
MEN ARE READY FOR TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES BUT NOT FOR THOSE WHICH LIFE DEMANDS OF THEM
THIS SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN OPPOSITION TO THEIR CONSCIENCE ONLY CONTINUES TO EXIST BECAUSE IT IS DISGUISED BY HYPOCRISY
CHRISTIANITY DOES NOT ATTACK IT AT ALL BUT FROM WITHIN IT DESTROYS ALL THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH GOVERNMENT RESTS
ALL THIS AND THE WORSHIP OF RELICS AND OF IKONS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO WORKS OF THEOLOGY AND INTO THE CATECHISMS
MORE THAN THAT IN GERMANY WHERE COMPULSORY SERVICE FIRST ORIGINATED CAPRIVI HAS GIVEN EXPRESSION TO WHAT HAD BEEN HITHERTO SO ASSIDUOUSLY CONCEALED--THAT IS THAT THE MEN THAT THE SOLDIERS WILL HAVE TO KILL ARE NOT FOREIGNERS ALONE BUT THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN THE VERY WORKING PEOPLE FROM WHOM THEY THEMSELVES ARE TAKEN
OUR WHOLE LIFE IS IN FLAT CONTRADICTION WITH ALL WE KNOW AND WITH ALL WE REGARD AS NECESSARY AND RIGHT
I AM AN EDUCATED MAN I KNOW THE LAW OF EVOLUTION AND THEREFORE I WILL ACT IN AN EVIL WAY
DO THEY REGARD IT AS GOOD
NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF LIBERAL ADVANCED PEOPLE AS THEY ARE CALLED STUDIOUSLY TURN AWAY FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID WRITTEN OR DONE OR IS BEING DONE BY MEN TO PROVE THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF FORCE IN ITS MOST AWFUL GROSS AND GLARING FORM--IN THE FORM THAT IS OF AN ARMY OF SOLDIERS PREPARED TO MURDER ANYONE WHOEVER IT MAY BE--WITH THE TEACHINGS OF CHRISTIANITY OR EVEN OF THE HUMANITY WHICH SOCIETY PROFESSES AS ITS CREED
THOSE IN AUTHORITY ARE CONVINCED THAT MEN ARE ONLY GUIDED AND ONLY PROGRESS THROUGH THE USE OF FORCE AND THEREFORE THEY CONFIDENTLY MAKE USE OF IT TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING ORGANIZATION
AND THEREFORE WHETHER THEIR CONSCIENCE IS TENDER OR THE REVERSE OUR RICH MEN CANNOT ENJOY THE WEALTH THEY HAVE FILCHED FROM THE POOR AS THE ANCIENTS DID WHO BELIEVED IN THEIR RIGHT TO IT
AND THAT IS WHY IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE ONLY A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF MEN HAS ASSIMILATED CHRISTIANITY IN EIGHTEEN CENTURIES IT MUST TAKE MANY TIMES AS MANY CENTURIES FOR ALL MANKIND TO ASSIMILATE IT AND THAT SINCE THAT TIME IS SO FAR OFF WE WHO LIVE IN THE PRESENT NEED NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
THE AIM OF LIFE IS LIMITED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE WILL OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS
BUT WHY SHOULD WE SPEAK OF THE PAST AND JUDGE FROM THE PAST WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN MISREPRESENTED AND MISUNDERSTOOD BY US
ANOTHER AS A PRIEST WHO HAS RECEIVED SPECIAL GRACE BY HIS ORDINATION
HE WILL LOSE HIS PROFITABLE POSITION FOR CERTAIN IF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS WHICH SECURED IT TO HIM IS DESTROYED
ALL THOSE THINGS ARE THE WORK OF MEN
IF I SAY THE TRUTH WHY DO YE NOT BELIEVE ME
AND THEREFORE PEOPLE IN POWER WHO HAVE BEEN PUT IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY BY FATE OR BY GOD HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO RUN THE RISK RUINING ALL THAT HAS BEEN GAINED BY CIVILIZATION JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TRY AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE WHETHER PUBLIC OPINION IS OR IS NOT ABLE TO REPLACE THE PROTECTION GIVEN BY AUTHORITY A FRENCH WRITER FORGOTTEN NOW ALPHONSE KARR SAID SOMEWHERE TRYING TO SHOW THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING AWAY WITH THE DEATH PENALTY
IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND CLEAR IF YOU DID NOT BY YOUR HYPOCRISY DISGUISE THE TRUTH WHICH HAS SO UNMISTAKABLY BEEN REVEALED TO US
HE FEELS THAT ALL THAT HE DOES HIMSELF AND THAT IS DONE AROUND HIM IS SOMETHING ABSURD HIDEOUS IMPOSSIBLE AND OPPOSED TO HIS CONSCIENCE
THE VERY GROSSNESS AND OBVIOUSNESS OF THE INCONSISTENCY CONFIRMS THEM IN THIS CONVICTION
IN THE MORNING THEY HAVE SLEPT OFF THEIR DRUNKENNESS AND HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER AT THE ZEMSKY COURT-HOUSE
YET THIS QUESTION IS PRESENTED BY LIFE ITSELF TO ALL MEN AND CALLS FOR SOME ANSWER FROM EVERY THINKING MAN
IN SPITE OF THE UNCEASING EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN AUTHORITY TO CONCEAL THIS AND ATTRIBUTE SOME OTHER SIGNIFICANCE TO IT AUTHORITY HAS ALWAYS MEANT FOR MAN THE CORD THE CHAIN WITH WHICH HE IS BOUND AND FETTERED OR THE KNOUT WITH WHICH HE IS TO BE FLOGGED OR THE AX WITH WHICH HE IS TO HAVE HANDS EARS NOSE OR HEAD CUT OFF OR AT THE VERY LEAST THE THREAT OF THESE TERRORS
THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED BY THE CHURCH IN THE PROFANE DOCTRINE THAT A MAN CANNOT BE SAVED BY HIS OWN POWERS BUT THAT THERE IS ANOTHER MEANS OF SALVATION WILL INFALLIBLY RELY UPON THIS MEANS AND NOT ON HIS OWN POWERS WHICH THEY ASSURE HIM IT IS SINFUL TO TRUST IN
THAT IT IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY LAWS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHICH ARE EQUALLY IMPERFECT OFTEN OBVIOUSLY WRONG AND UNJUST AND ARE CRITICISED FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW IN THE NEWSPAPERS
IT IS EQUALLY CHIMERICAL TO RECKON ON PROJECTS OF DISARMAMENT THE EXECUTION OF WHICH IS RENDERED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BY CONSIDERATIONS OF A POPULAR CHARACTER PRESENT TO THE MIND OF ALL OUR READERS
THE HYPNOTIZED SUBJECT FEELS HIMSELF BOUND TO CARRY OUT THE SUGGESTION--HE THINKS HE CANNOT STOP--BUT THE NEARER HE GETS TO THE TIME AND THE PLACE OF THE ACTION THE MORE THE BENUMBED CONSCIENCE BEGINS TO STIR TO RESIST AND TO TRY TO AWAKE
LET US GO THEY SAID AND LEAVE US ALONE
13
AND THESE ARE YOUNG MEN WHO MIGHT WORK BE PRODUCTIVE AND USEFUL
MEN NEED ONLY UNDERSTAND THIS THEY NEED ONLY CEASE TO TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE GENERAL EXTERNAL CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE NOT FREE AND DEVOTE ONE-HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ENERGY THEY WASTE ON THOSE MATERIAL THINGS TO THAT IN WHICH THEY ARE FREE TO THE RECOGNITION AND REALIZATION OF THE TRUTH WHICH IS BEFORE THEM AND TO THE LIBERATION OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS FROM DECEPTION AND HYPOCRISY AND WITHOUT EFFORT OR CONFLICT THERE WOULD BE AN END AT ONCE OF THE FALSE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE WHICH MAKES MEN MISERABLE AND THREATENS THEM WITH WORSE CALAMITIES IN THE FUTURE
FORCE CAN NEVER SUPPRESS WHAT IS SANCTIONED BY PUBLIC OPINION
A JUDGE A COMMANDER OF POLICE A GOVERNOR OR AN OFFICER WILL KEEP HIS POSITION JUST THE SAME UNDER BOULANGER OR THE REPUBLIC UNDER POUGACHEF OR CATHERINE
ITS WHOLE MEANING IS CONCENTRATED FOR THEM IN ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS--IN CATHOLICISM PROTESTANTISM IN CERTAIN DOGMAS OR IN THE CONFLICT WITH THE TEMPORAL POWER
WHY SHOULD WE PAY HIM TRIBUTE
BUT I KNEW LITTLE OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY THESE SO-CALLED SECTS TOWARD EXPOUNDING THE QUESTION
BALLOU'S WORK CONFIRMED ME STILL MORE IN THIS VIEW
A SIMPLE UNCORRUPTED YOUTH CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THOSE WHO STAND SO HIGH IN HIS OPINION WHOM HE REGARDS AS HOLY OR LEARNED MEN COULD FOR ANY OBJECT WHATEVER MISLEAD HIM SO SHAMEFULLY
THESE PRECEPTS MUST AND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY HIGHER AND HIGHER PRECEPTS ON THE WAY TO THE PERFECTION HELD UP BY THE RELIGION
TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN AND NOT TO FEAR THOSE WHO CAN DESTROY THE BODY BUT TO FEAR HIM WHO CAN DESTROY BODY AND SOUL
WE CANNOT SHARE THIS SCRUPLE
WE SEE PEOPLE ENSLAVING THEMSELVES SUFFERING FROM THIS SLAVERY AND BELIEVING THAT IT MUST BE SO THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER AND WILL NOT HINDER THE EMANCIPATION OF MEN WHICH IS BEING PREPARED SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW IN SPITE OF THE EVER-INCREASING GROWTH OF SLAVERY
WE MIGHT AT LEAST DEMAND THE REDUCTION OF THE ENORMOUS EXPENSES OF WAR ORGANIZED AS IT IS AT PRESENT WITH A VIEW TO THE POWER OF INVASION WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND A DECISIVE BATTLE WITHIN A WEEK OF THE DECLARATION OF WAR
CONSCIOUSLY THROUGH SPIRITUAL CAUSES AND UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGH MATERIAL CAUSES
JUST IN THE SAME WAY ONLY LET ONE MAN LOOK AT LIFE AS CHRISTIANITY TEACHES HIM TO LOOK AT IT AND AFTER HIM LET ANOTHER AND ANOTHER DO THE SAME AND THE ENCHANTED CIRCLE OF EXISTENCE IN THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE FROM WHICH THERE SEEMED NO ESCAPE WILL BE BROKEN THROUGH
THESE QUESTIONS WERE PUT PLAINLY AND DIRECTLY AND SEEMED TO REQUIRE A PLAIN AND DIRECT ANSWER
BUT IT IS NOT ONLY THE MISERY OF THE POSITION WHICH MAKES THIS INEVITABLE
AND THEN TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION THE VERY ASKING OF WHICH PROVED THEIR MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE THERE WAS UTTERED IN THIS ASSEMBLY AS IS DESCRIBED IN THE ACTS THAT STRANGE PHRASE WHICH WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOUND NECESSARY TO GIVE EXTERNAL CONFIRMATION TO CERTAIN ASSERTIONS AND WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF SO MUCH EVIL
AND IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE
BUT IT WILL BE ANSWERED SUPPOSE ALL WERE AGREED
THEN THE ANCIENTS ALLOWED THE RESISTANCE OF INJURY BY INJURY
ET L'ON EUT EXCITE LES JUSTES MOQUERIES DE LA GRECE EN VOULANT FAIRE D'EPICURE OU DE ZENON UN DISCIPLE DE L'ACADEMIE
FOR BEHOLD THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU LUKE XVII
IN THE MAINTENANCE AND USE OF THESE EXPENSIVE APPLIANCES FOR MURDER WE CAN VERY SUITABLY EXERCISE TO THE FULL THE VIRTUES OF FORGIVENESS TO THOSE WHO INJURE US LOVE TOWARD OUR ENEMIES BLESSINGS TO THOSE WHO CURSE US AND DOING GOOD TO THOSE WHO HATE US
THESE CASES PUT THE RULING POWERS INTO A DESPERATE POSITION
CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE
BUT THE LAWS OF THE WORLD ARE NOT MADE FOR OUR PLEASURE THEY ARE MADE FOR OUR PROGRESS
THEY KNOW THAT IF FOR ONE INSTANT THEY ARE WORSTED IN THE STRUGGLE WITH THEIR OPPRESSED SLAVES THEY WILL PERISH BECAUSE THE SLAVES ARE EXASPERATED AND THEIR EXASPERATION IS GROWING MORE INTENSE WITH EVERY DAY OF OPPRESSION
REVOLUTIONARY ENEMIES ATTACK THE GOVERNMENT FROM WITHOUT
BUT THE OBJECT OF THIS LOVE IS NOT FOUND OUTSIDE SELF IN SOCIETIES OF INDIVIDUALS NOR IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD BUT WITHIN SELF IN THE DIVINE SELF WHOSE ESSENCE IS THAT VERY LOVE WHICH THE ANIMAL SELF IS BROUGHT TO FEEL THE NEED OF THROUGH ITS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS OWN PERISHABLE NATURE
FOR EVERY STEP FORWARD ALONG THE PATH POINTED OUT FOR US BY CHRIST IS A STEP TOWARD THEIR DESTRUCTION
IF STATE VIOLENCE CEASED THERE WOULD BE ACTS OF VIOLENCE PERHAPS ON THE PART OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE OTHER THAN THOSE WHO HAD DONE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE BEFORE
PEOPLE HAVE BELIEVED AS THOUGH IT WERE SOMETHING FULLY PROVED AND SO NEEDING NO PROOF THAT SINCE ALL NATIONS HAVE HITHERTO DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF STATES THAT FORM OF ORGANIZATION IS AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY
THAT IT IS ONLY THE MEEK WHO SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT TIME DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE JUSTICE OF THE LAW THEY DESPISE IT BUT STILL THEY OBEY IT
WHAT THEN HAS BROUGHT THESE MASSES OF HONEST MEN ON WHOM THE WHOLE THING DEPENDS WHO GAIN NOTHING BY IT AND WHO HAVE TO DO THESE ATROCIOUS DEEDS WITH THEIR OWN HANDS WHAT HAS BROUGHT THEM TO ACCEPT THE AMAZING DELUSION THAT THE EXISTING ORDER UNPROFITABLE RUINOUS AND FATAL AS IT IS FOR THEM IS THE ORDER WHICH OUGHT TO EXIST
71-80 THE AUTHOR SEES ALL THE HORROR OF WAR
DE VOQUE THIS AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT HISTORY HUMAN NATURE AND GOD SHOW US THAT SO LONG AS THERE ARE TWO MEN AND BREAD MONEY AND A WOMAN--THERE WILL BE WAR
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON TOOK PART IN A DISCUSSION ON THE MEANS OF SUPPRESSING WAR IN THE SOCIETY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PEACE AMONG MEN WHICH EXISTED IN 1838 IN AMERICA
MOREOVER THEY ARE ALL PROFESSED CHRISTIANS AND REGARD ALL VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST THE DEFENSELESS AS BASE AND DISGRACEFUL
THE MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING ORDER IS NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY AND OF HUMANITY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE AND HUMAN PROGRESS
LIFE ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF GOD ONLY IS ALSO NOT HUMAN LIFE
WITH HIS FAVORITES THE SYPHILITIC DRUNKEN PETER WITH HIS BUFFOONS THE VICIOUS CATHERINE WITH HER PARAMOURS RULED AND OPPRESSED THE INDUSTRIOUS RELIGIOUS RUSSIANS OF THEIR TIMES
BUT MAN IS NOT STATIONARY IN REGARD TO TRUTH BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN AS HE PASSES THROUGH LIFE AND HUMANITY AS A WHOLE IN THE SAME WAY IS CONTINUALLY LEARNING TO KNOW A GREATER AND GREATER DEGREE OF TRUTH AND GROWING MORE AND MORE FREE FROM ERROR
THEN THEY LEAD HIM INTO THE MAIN HALL SHUTTING HIM OFF APART FROM THE REST BY A BENCH BEHIND WHICH ALL THE CONSCRIPTS WHO HAVE BEEN PASSED FOR SERVICE ARE WAITING
SO WROTE THE AMERICAN AUTHOR SAVAGE AND INGERSOLL THE POPULAR FREETHINKING AMERICAN PREACHER AND MANY OTHERS
IT IS TERRIBLE TO THINK WHAT THE CHURCHES DO TO MEN
AND OF THIS MASS OF MEN SO BRUTALIZED AS TO BE READY TO PROMISE TO KILL THEIR OWN PARENTS THE SOCIAL REFORMERS--CONSERVATIVES LIBERALS SOCIALISTS AND ANARCHISTS--PROPOSE TO FORM A RATIONAL AND MORAL SOCIETY
SUDDENLY IN KHARKOV A PEASANT REFUSES TO PERFORM THIS DUTY JUSTIFYING HIS REFUSAL ON THE GROUND THAT BY THE LAW OF CHRIST OF WHICH HE IS A FOLLOWER HE CANNOT PUT ANY MAN IN FETTERS LOCK HIM UP OR DRAG HIM FROM PLACE TO PLACE
THE CHURCH IS HOLY CHRISTIANITY OR THE COLLECTION OF ALL BELIEVERS UNDER CHRIST THEIR HEAD TO WHOM THE HOLY GHOST THROUGH THE GOSPELS AND SACRAMENTS PROMISES COMMUNICATES AND ADMINISTERS HEAVENLY SALVATION MEANING THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS LOST IN ERROR AND THAT THE TRUE MEANS OF SALVATION IS IN LUTHERANISM
WE GIVE OUR ACTS UP TO THE WILL OF OTHERS AND OUR ACTS CANNOT BE GOOD OR BAD
ON THE CONTRARY PUBLIC OPINION NEED ONLY BE IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO FORCE TO NEUTRALIZE THE WHOLE EFFECT OF THE USE OF FORCE
AND PEOPLE WHO SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF ARISTOCRACY AND OF PATRIOTISM TO-DUTY DON'T BELIEVE AND CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY ASSERT
AND THIS IS WHAT IS CONSTANTLY HAPPENING
CHANCE MEETING WITH A TRAIN CARRYING SOLDIERS TO RESTORE ORDER AMONG THE FAMISHING PEASANTS--REASON OF THE EXPEDITION--HOW THE DECISIONS OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES ARE ENFORCED IN CASES OF INSUBORDINATION ON PART OF THE PEASANTS--WHAT HAPPENED AT OREL AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE RIGHTS OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES ARE MAINTAINED BY MURDER AND TORTURE--ALL THE PRIVILEGES OF THE WEALTHY ARE BASED ON SIMILAR ACTS OF VIOLENCE
AND BE READY TO ASSIST EITHER IN PERSON OR BY PROXY IN DEVASTATION PLUNDER AND MURDER OF THEIR MEN WOMEN CHILDREN AND AGED ALIKE--POSSIBLY YOUR OWN KINSMEN OR RELATIONS--IF THAT IS NECESSARY TO US
AND IF THE MAN WHO HAS MASTERED THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WOULD NOT WITHOUT WAITING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BEGIN TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS CONCEPTION MANKIND WOULD NEVER CHANGE ITS POSITION
THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WILL EMANCIPATE MEN FROM THE MISERIES OF OUR PAGAN LIFE X
AND WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE REST NOT ONLY CAN BUT MUST INEVITABLY UNDERSTAND HEREAFTER
IT MAY WELL BE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT HELP REGARDING ALL THIS AS NECESSARY AND INDISPENSABLE
YOU HAVE RELATIONS A FAMILY SUBORDINATES AND SUPERIORS
I HAVE BEEN TOLD A STORY OF A GALLANT POLICE OFFICER WHO CAME TO A VILLAGE WHERE THE PEASANTS WERE IN INSURRECTION AND THE MILITARY HAD BEEN CALLED OUT AND HE UNDERTOOK TO PACIFY THE INSURRECTION IN THE SPIRIT OF NICHOLAS I BY HIS PERSONAL INFLUENCE ALONE
BUT STRANGE TO SAY IT IS PRECISELY THOSE PEOPLE WHO PROFESS MOST ANXIETY FOR THE AMELIORATION OF HUMAN LIFE AND ARE REGARDED AS THE LEADERS OF PUBLIC OPINION WHO ASSERT THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO DO THAT AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER MORE EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR THE AMELIORATION OF MEN'S CONDITION
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE MODERN WORLD IS THREATENED THE CONQUERED PEOPLE WILL BE WIPED OUT OF EXISTENCE AND WHICHEVER IT MAY BE WE SHALL SEE A MORAL FORCE ANNIHILATED AS IF THERE WERE TOO MANY FORCES TO WORK FOR GOOD--WE SHALL HAVE A NEW EUROPE FORMED ON FOUNDATIONS SO UNJUST SO BRUTAL SO SANGUINARY STAINED WITH SO MONSTROUS A CRIME THAT IT CANNOT BUT BE WORSE THAN THE EUROPE OF TO-DAY--MORE INIQUITOUS MORE BARBAROUS MORE VIOLENT
ONE MAN MAY NOT KILL
THE POSITION OF A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OR OF A RICH MAN IS NO LONGER AS IT ONCE WAS AND STILL IS AMONG NON-CHRISTIAN PEOPLES REGARDED AS NECESSARILY HONORABLE AND DESERVING OF RESPECT AND UNDER THE SPECIAL BLESSING OF GOD
THE ART OF WAR HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THE OTHER ARTS
AND TO DO THIS A MAN NEED ACCOMPLISH NO GREAT FEATS OR EXPLOITS
WHY HAVE THEY KILLED HER BOY HER HANDSOME BOY HER ONE HOPE HER PRIDE HER LIFE
AND TO MAINTAIN SO GREAT A MULTITUDE OF SOLDIERS AND TO MAKE SUCH VAST PREPARATIONS FOR MURDER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ARE SPENT ANNUALLY SUMS WHICH WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR IMMENSE WORKS OF PUBLIC UTILITY AND WHICH WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE SOCIAL QUESTION
WHETHER HE BE MASTER OR SLAVE THE MAN OF TO-DAY CANNOT HELP CONSTANTLY FEELING THE PAINFUL OPPOSITION BETWEEN HIS CONSCIENCE AND ACTUAL LIFE AND THE MISERIES RESULTING FROM IT
AND YET I SAY UNTO YOU THAT EVEN SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY WAS NOT ARRAYED LIKE ONE OF THESE
ONE CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS
HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON WHICH SOONER OR LATER THREATENS US ALL WITH INEVITABLE BANKRUPTCY
HE THAT SMITETH A MAN SO THAT HE DIE SHALL BE SURELY PUT TO DEATH
LET A MAN ONLY UNDERSTAND HIS LIFE AS CHRISTIANITY TEACHES HIM TO UNDERSTAND IT LET HIM UNDERSTAND THAT IS THAT HIS LIFE BELONGS NOT TO HIM--NOT TO HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY NOR TO HIS FAMILY NOR TO THE STATE--BUT TO HIM WHO HAS SENT HIM INTO THE WORLD AND LET HIM ONCE UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST THEREFORE FULFILL NOT THE LAW OF HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY NOR HIS FAMILY NOR OF THE STATE BUT THE INFINITE LAW OF HIM FROM WHOM HE HAS COME
THE CONGRESS RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE THAT CHRISTIANITY EXERCISES ON THE MORAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS OF MANKIND AND EARNESTLY URGES UPON MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL AND OTHER RELIGIOUS TEACHERS THE DUTY OF SETTING FORTH THE PRINCIPLES OF PEACE AND GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN
IN ANY CASE THERE IS NO DOUBT WE SHALL BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE OLD FORMS OF LIFE WHICH HAVE BECOME IMPOSSIBLE AND FATAL AND MUST GO FORWARD TO MEET THE FUTURE
E VIOLENCE IS NEEDED TO DEFEND MEN FROM OTHER POSSIBLE OPPRESSORS IN THE PRESENT OR THE FUTURE SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
NOR YET FOR YOUR BODY WHAT YE SHALL PUT ON
IF EVERY MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO HAVE RECOURSE TO FORCE IN FACE OF A DANGER THREATENING AN OTHER THE QUESTION OF THE USE OF FORCE IS REDUCED TO A QUESTION OF THE DEFINITION OF DANGER FOR ANOTHER
THEY BEHAVE TO HIS TEACHING MUCH AS SELF-ASSERTIVE PEOPLE TALK TO THOSE WHOM THEY CONSIDER BENEATH THEM OFTEN SUPPLYING THEIR COMPANIONS WORDS
THOUGH ASLEEP THE CONSCIENCE IS THERE AND IN SPITE OF THE HYPNOTISM IT IS ALREADY SPEAKING IN THEM AND IT MAY AWAKE
THE GOVERNOR ARRIVES ON THE SCENE OF ACTION AND DELIVERS AN HARANGUE TO THE PEOPLE REPROACHING THEM FOR THEIR INSUBORDINATION AND EITHER STATIONS TROOPS IN THE HOUSES OF THE VILLAGES WHERE SOMETIMES FOR A WHOLE MONTH THE SOLDIERS DRAIN THE RESOURCES OF THE PEASANTS OR CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH THREATS HE MERCIFULLY TAKES LEAVE OF THE PEOPLE OR WHAT IS THE MOST FREQUENT COURSE HE ANNOUNCES THAT THE RINGLEADERS MUST BE PUNISHED AND QUITE ARBITRARILY WITHOUT ANY TRIAL SELECTS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEN REGARDED AS RINGLEADERS AND COMMANDS THEM TO BE FLOGGED IN HIS PRESENCE
BUT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE
THEY ARE BOUND TO SUFFER
BUT PARTLY OWING TO MY LITERARY REPUTATION PARTLY BECAUSE THE BOOK HAD EXCITED PEOPLE'S CURIOSITY IT CIRCULATED IN MANUSCRIPT AND IN LITHOGRAPHED COPIES IN RUSSIA AND THROUGH TRANSLATIONS ABROAD AND IT EVOLVED ON ONE SIDE FROM THOSE WHO SHARED MY CONVICTIONS A SERIES OF ESSAYS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT ON THE OTHER SIDE A SERIES OF CRITICISMS ON THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN MY BOOK
ONE A YOUNG FELLOW IN BOOTS AND A RED SHIRT JUST AS HE WAS HIMSELF A YEAR AGO--HE THE SOLDIER WHO MUST FIRE UPON HIM
THE FOLLOWER OF CHRIST WHOSE SERVICE MEANS AN EVER-GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF HIS TEACHING AND AN EVER-CLOSER FULFILLMENT OF IT IN PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION CANNOT JUST BECAUSE HE IS A FOLLOWER OF CHRIST CLAIM FOR HIMSELF OR ANY OTHER THAT HE UNDERSTANDS CHRIST'S TEACHING FULLY AND FULFILLS IT
THE ESSENCE OF THIS STATE IS THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ONE SUGGESTION THEY LOSE THE POWER OF CRITICISING THEIR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE DO WITHOUT THINKING EVERYTHING CONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION TO WHICH THEY ARE LED BY EXAMPLE PRECEPT OR INSINUATION
THOSE OF THE RULING CLASSES HAVING NO LONGER ANY REASONABLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROFITABLE POSITIONS THEY OCCUPY ARE FORCED IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM TO STIFLE THEIR HIGHER RATIONAL FACULTY OF LOVING AND TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR POSITIONS ARE INDISPENSABLE
ONE OF THE FIRST PRECEPTS OF THE ETERNAL LAW INSCRIBED IN THE CONSCIENCES OF ALL MEN SAYS THE ABBY DEFOURNEY IS THE PROHIBITION OF TAKING THE LIFE OR SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF A FELLOW-CREATURE WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAUSE WITHOUT BEING FORCED INTO THE NECESSITY OF IT
BUT THOSE WHO KNOW THE TRUTH AND DO EVIL MASKED BY HYPOCRISY INJURE THEMSELVES AND THEIR VICTIMS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER MEN AS WELL WHO ARE LED ASTRAY BY THE FALSEHOOD WITH WHICH THE WRONGDOING IS DISGUISED
THE CONSERVATIVES BECAUSE THIS PRINCIPLE WOULD HINDER THEIR ACTIVITY IN RESISTANCE TO EVIL AS APPLIED TO THE REVOLUTIONISTS IN PERSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THEM
OR LO THERE
A NEW REIGN IS BEGINNING
HARDLY COULD ANY REVOLUTION BE MORE DISASTROUS FOR THE GREAT MASS OF THE POPULATION THAN THE PRESENT ORDER OR RATHER DISORDER OF OUR LIFE WITH ITS DAILY SACRIFICES TO EXHAUSTING AND UNNATURAL TOIL TO POVERTY DRUNKENNESS AND PROFLIGACY WITH ALL THE HORRORS OF THE WAR THAT IS AT HAND WHICH WILL SWALLOW UP IN ONE YEAR MORE VICTIMS THAN ALL THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE CENTURY
WHEREVER THERE IS A CHURCH THERE MUST BE THE CONCEPTION OF HERESY
A MAN MAY CEASE TO DO WHAT HE REGARDS AS WRONG BUT HE CANNOT CEASE TO CONSIDER WRONG WHAT IS WRONG
I HOLD WITH DARWIN THAT VIOLENT STRUGGLE IS A LAW OF NATURE WHICH OVERRULES ALL OTHER LAWS
9
IN THE MAJORITY OF INSTANCES THEY HAVE BELIEVED IN ALL SIMPLICITY THAT GOVERNMENTS EXIST FOR THEIR BENEFIT
BOOKS AND STATUES
THE MORE FREQUENT MEANING MORE OFTEN ASCRIBED TO THE WORD HERESY IS THAT OF AN OPINION WHICH REJECTS THE CHURCH DOCTRINE FOUNDED AND SUPPORTED BY THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITIES
FOR THE MORROW SHALL TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE THINGS OF ITSELF
CHRISTIANITY RECOGNIZES LOVE OF SELF OF FAMILY OF NATION AND OF HUMANITY AND NOT ONLY OF HUMANITY BUT OF EVERYTHING LIVING EVERYTHING EXISTING
DEAR SIR
PEOPLE SAY WORKMEN HAVE NO BUSINESS TO TRY TO BECOME CAPITALISTS THE POOR TO TRY TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE RICH THAT IS A MISTAKE
THAT IS THE SECOND COMMAND
THESE THEN ARE THE TRUTHS WHICH MAN IS FREE TO RECOGNIZE OR TO REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE
THERE IS ONE THING AND ONLY ONE THING IN WHICH IT IS GRANTED TO YOU TO BE FREE IN LIFE ALL ELSE BEING BEYOND YOUR POWER
THE ONLY MEANS BY WHICH HE CAN ESCAPE FROM THIS SUFFERING IS BY BLUNTING HIS CONSCIENCE BUT EVEN IF SOME MEN SUCCEED IN DULLING THEIR CONSCIENCE THEY CANNOT DULL THEIR FEARS
AND HERE I SAW THE SPECTACLE OF GOOD RUSSIANS FULL OF THE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT TRAVELING WITH GUNS AND RODS TO TORTURE AND KILL THEIR STARVING BRETHREN
THEY ONLY DREAD THE DOWNFALL OF THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF AND THAT IS THE REASON--THOUGH OFTEN AN UNCONSCIOUS ONE--THAT THEY SUPPORT IT
BUT----SINCE PHILOSOPHERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS ARE NOT THE CONTROLLING POWERS IT IS WELL FOR OUR SOLDIERS TO GUARD OUR FRONTIER AND HOMES AND THEIR ARMS SKILLFULLY USED ARE PERHAPS THE SUREST GUARANTEE OF THE PEACE WE ALL LOVE
YE HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE
HOW WAS IT THEY DID NOT RISE IN INDIGNATION AND BAR THE ROADS SHOUTING NO
THE DEAD THEY BURY AND THE WOUNDED THEY CARRY TO THE HOSPITAL
THE EXPULSION FROM THE TEMPLE
AND AGAIN NOTHING HAPPENS
AND URGES THE DESIRABILITY OF IMPRESSING ON THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS WHO FORMULATE THE QUESTIONS FOR EXAMINATION THE PROPRIETY OF GUIDING THE MINDS OF CHILDREN IN THE PRINCIPLES OF PEACE
YASNAIA POLIANA MAY 14/26 1893
EVERYTHING IS DISCUSSED EXCEPT WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF THE BOOK
THE CONGRESS PROPOSES TO THE INTER-PARLIAMENTARY CONFERENCE THAT THE UTMOST SUPPORT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EVERY PROJECT FOR UNIFICATION OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES COINAGE TARIFF POSTAGE AND TELEGRAPHIC ARRANGEMENTS ETC WHICH WOULD ASSIST IN CONSTITUTING A COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND SCIENTIFIC UNION OF THE PEOPLES
BESIDES EVERY SOCIAL LAW AIMS AT THE AMELIORATION OF MAN'S LIFE
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD ONE MAY COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND MURDER
AND EVEN THIS DUTY THEY PERFORM LESS AND LESS SUCCESSFULLY
MEN OF THE MOST DIVERSE VIEWS BELIEVERS AND WHAT IS SURPRISING UNBELIEVING LIBERALS ALSO AS THOUGH BY AGREEMENT ALL PRESERVE THE SAME PERSISTENT SILENCE ABOUT THEM AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY PEOPLE TO EXPLAIN THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST'S DOCTRINE REMAINS EITHER IGNORED OR FORGOTTEN
IT CANNOT BE ONE SAYS THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN POINT TO SUCH MEN AS CHRYSOSTOM FENELON BUTLER AND OTHERS PROFESSING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY ONE IS TEMPTED TO SAY THE CHURCHES MAY HAVE STRAYED AWAY FROM CHRISTIANITY THEY MAY BE IN ERROR BUT THEY CANNOT BE HOSTILE TO IT BUT WE MUST LOOK TO THE FRUIT TO JUDGE THE TREE AS CHRIST TAUGHT US
YES INDEED SINCE GOVERNMENT ASSUMES THE RIGHT OF ANNIHILATING PEOPLES THUS THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLES ASSUME THE RIGHT OF ANNIHILATING GOVERNMENTS
IT WAS ENOUGH FOR A FEW MEN SOME PERSONALLY CONCERNED IN THE AFFAIR AND OTHERS SIMPLY OUTSIDERS TO EXPRESS THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF FLOGGINGS THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE ELSEWHERE AND THEIR CONTEMPT AND LOATHING FOR THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN INFLICTING THEM FOR A FEW PERSONS IN THE TOULA CASE TO EXPRESS THEIR REPUGNANCE TO HAVING ANY SHARE IN IT
THE LAND OWNER LAID A COMPLAINT BEFORE THE DISTRICT COMMANDER WHO ILLEGALLY AS WAS RECOGNIZED LATER EVEN BY A LEGAL DECISION DECIDED THE MATTER IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNER AND ALLOWED HIM TO DIVERT THE WATER COURSE
TO ATTAIN THE FIRST AIM THE CONGRESS HAS RECOURSE TO TEACHERS OF HISTORY TO WOMEN AND TO THE CLERGY WITH THE ADVICE TO THE LATTER TO PREACH ON THE EVIL OF WAR AND THE BLESSING OF PEACE EVERY THIRD SUNDAY IN DECEMBER
SINCE THE EXISTING ORDER IS IMMUTABLE THEY SAY THE REFUSAL OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL TO PERFORM THE DUTIES LAID UPON HIM WILL EFFECT NO CHANGE IN THINGS AND WILL ONLY MEAN THAT SOME OTHER MAN WILL BE PUT IN HIS PLACE WHO MAY DO THE WORK WORSE THAT IS TO SAY MORE CRUELLY TO THE STILL GREATER INJURY OF THE VICTIMS OF THE ACT OF VIOLENCE THIS CONVICTION THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS THE NECESSARY AND THEREFORE IMMUTABLE ORDER WHICH IT IS A SACRED DUTY FOR EVERY MAN TO SUPPORT ENABLES GOOD MEN OF HIGH PRINCIPLES IN PRIVATE LIFE TO TAKE PART WITH CONSCIENCE MORE OR LESS UNTROUBLED IN CRIMES SUCH AS THAT PERPETRATED IN OREL AND THAT WHICH THE MEN IN THE TOULA TRAIN WERE GOING TO PERPETRATE
LIKE A BOLD HYPNOTIZER HE TESTS THE DEGREE OF INSENSIBILITY OF THE HYPNOTIZED SUBJECT
ARNOLD ON HERESIES--HERESIES THE MANIFESTATIONS OF PROGRESS IN THE CHURCHES--CHURCHES CAUSE DISSENSION AMONG MEN AND ARE ALWAYS HOSTILE TO CHRISTIANITY--ACCOUNT OF THE WORK DONE BY THE RUSSIAN CHURCH--MATT
THEY SEND THEM TO JAIL AND LET THEM OUT AGAIN AND THESE PEOPLE LIVE WITHOUT PASSPORTS
THEY GENUINELY DETEST ALL THIS BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PUT A STOP TO IT OR PERHAPS CANNOT DECIDE TO GIVE UP WHAT PRESERVES IT ALL AND SEEMS TO THEM NECESSARY
THE CREED IS TAUGHT AND IS READ AS A PRAYER IN THE CHURCHES BUT THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT IS EXCLUDED EVEN FROM THE GOSPEL PASSAGES READ IN THE CHURCHES SO THAT THE CONGREGATION NEVER HEARS IT IN CHURCH EXCEPT ON THOSE DAYS WHEN THE WHOLE OF THE GOSPEL IS READ
WHETHER THE OLD HABITUAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE ARE SUPPORTED OR WHETHER THEY ARE ABOLISHED AND ALTOGETHER NEW AND BETTER CONDITIONS ARISE
THEY SEE THE SUFFERINGS AND PRIVATIONS OF THESE LABORERS AND THEIR CHILDREN THEIR AGED THEIR WIVES AND THEIR SICK THEY KNOW THE PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED ON THOSE WHO RESIST THIS ORGANIZED PLUNDER AND FAR FROM DECREASING FAR FROM CONCEALING THEIR LUXURY THEY INSOLENTLY DISPLAY IT BEFORE THESE OPPRESSED LABORERS WHO HATE THEM AS THOUGH INTENTIONALLY PROVOKING THEM WITH THE POMP OF THEIR PARKS AND PALACES THEIR THEATERS HUNTS AND RACES
THEY HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES FLOGGED AND MADE TO RUN THE GAUNTLET BUT THEY WOULD SUBMIT READILY TO THE CRUELEST TORTURES AND EVEN TO DEATH RATHER THAN SERVE
THE WARS OF THE GRAND MONARQUE WERE NOT ONLY NO HINDRANCE TO THE PROGRESS OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES BUT EVEN ON THE CONTRARY SEEM TO HAVE PROMOTED AND FAVORED THEIR DEVELOPMENT SO WAR IS A BENEFICIAL THING
THIS CIRCLE IS MADE UP NOW OF FOUR METHODS OF WORKING UPON MEN JOINED TOGETHER LIKE THE LIMES OF A CHAIN RING
AND VIOLENCE THEY SAY IS NECESSARY TO KEEP SAVAGES AND CRIMINALS FROM ANNIHILATING OUR CIVILIZATION
BUT HE THINKS THAT THAT WILL NEVER COME TO PASS AND THAT THERE IS THEREFORE NO ESCAPE FROM THE PRESENT POSITION
THE POSITIVISTS HOWEVER AND ALL THE APOSTLES OF FRATERNITY ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE WEAKENING OF SENTIMENT IN PROPORTION TO THE EXTENSION OF ITS OBJECT DRAW FURTHER DEDUCTIONS IN THEORY IN THE SAME DIRECTION
ONE MAN CANNOT PLUNDER AND PILLAGE BUT A WHOLE NATION CAN
THEY ARE MISTAKEN BECAUSE FORCE DOES NOT PROTECT HUMANITY BUT ON THE CONTRARY DEPRIVES IT OF THE ONLY POSSIBLE MEANS OF REALLY PROTECTING ITSELF THAT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DIFFUSION OF A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION
FROM ALL THIS SPEECHIFYING AND WRITING IT WILL COME TO PASS ACCORDING TO THEIR NOTIONS THAT GOVERNMENTS WILL CEASE TO LEVY THE SOLDIERS ON WHOM THEIR WHOLE STRENGTH DEPENDS WILL LISTEN TO THEIR DISCOURSES AND WILL DISBAND THEIR FORCES LEAVING THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY DEFENSE NOT ONLY AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT ALSO AGAINST THEIR OWN SUBJECTS
THE IDEAL IS PERFECT CHASTITY EVEN IN THOUGHT
BUT BEFORE CHRIST MEN DID NOT SEE THAT RESISTANCE BY FORCE TO WHAT EACH REGARDS AS EVIL SIMPLY BECAUSE ONE THINKS EVIL WHAT THE OTHER THINKS GOOD IS ONLY ONE OF THE METHODS OF SETTLING THE DISPUTE AND THAT THERE IS ANOTHER METHOD THAT OF NOT RESISTING EVIL BY FORCE AT ALL
THE RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION IS ENCOURAGED BY ESTABLISHING WITH MONEY TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE TEMPLES PROCESSIONS MEMORIALS AND FESTIVALS WHICH AIDED BY PAINTING ARCHITECTURE MUSIC AND INCENSE INTOXICATE THE PEOPLE AND ABOVE ALL BY THE SUPPORT OF THE CLERGY WHOSE DUTY CONSISTS IN BRUTALIZING THE PEOPLE AND KEEPING THEM IN A PERMANENT STATE OF STUPEFACTION BY THEIR TEACHING THE SOLEMNITY OF THEIR SERVICES THEIR SERMONS AND THEIR INTERFERENCE IN PRIVATE LIFE--AT BIRTHS DEATHS AND MARRIAGES
THIS IS ONE OF THE COMMANDMENTS WHICH IS MOST DEEPLY STAMPED IN THE HEART OF MAN
METHODS OF PROTECTING THE WORKING CLASSES WHICH WILL NOT FREE THEM FROM SLAVERY
SO MANY INSTIGATE ASSIST OR SANCTION THE COMMISSION OF EVERY ONE OF THESE ACTIONS THAT NO ONE WHO HAS A HAND IN THEM FEELS HIMSELF MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR IT
WE WILL NOT HURT ANYONE
TO BUY THEM OVER WITH BRIBES IS IMPOSSIBLE
I OUGHT TO BE FREE EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE AND LOVED
BUT THE LONGER MEN LIVED IN THE WORLD AND THE MORE COMPLEX THEIR RELATIONS BECAME THE MORE EVIDENT IT WAS THAT TO RESIST BY FORCE WHAT EACH REGARDED AS EVIL WAS IRRATIONAL THAT CONFLICT WAS IN NO WAY LESSENED THEREBY AND THAT NO HUMAN DEFINITIONS CAN SUCCEED IN MAKING WHAT SOME REGARD AS EVIL BE ACCEPTED AS SUCH BY OTHERS
WOE UNTO YOU THAT ARE FULL
THIS VIEW OF LIFE IS THE LAST AND FOUNDED UPON IT IS THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING WHICH IS A GUIDE FOR THE WHOLE OF OUR LIFE AND LIES AT THE ROOT OF ALL OUR ACTIVITY PRACTICAL AND THEORETIC
FOR A CHRISTIAN THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO ANY GOVERNMENT WHATEVER THE VERY ACT WHICH IS REGARDED AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE--IS A DIRECT RENUNCIATION OF CHRISTIANITY
I HAVE LIVED A LONGISH LIFE AND HAVE HEARD OUR MINISTERS PREACH ON UNIVERSAL PEACE HARDLY HALF A DOZEN TIMES
AND ALL THESE POOR DELUDED LADS BELIEVE THAT THESE NONSENSICAL AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE WORDS WHICH THEY HAVE JUST UTTERED SET THEM FREE FOR THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SERVICE FROM THEIR DUTIES AS MEN AND LAY UPON THEM FRESH AND MORE BINDING DUTIES AS SOLDIERS
HAS THE POWER ALWAYS PASSED FROM A WORSE PERSON TO A BETTER ONE
CHAPTER XI
TO REFUTE SUCH AN ASSERTION IS USELESS BECAUSE THE VERY PEOPLE WHO MAKE THIS ASSERTION REFUTE THEMSELVES OR RATHER RENOUNCE CHRIST INVENTING A CHRISTIANITY AND A CHRIST OF THEIR OWN IN THE PLACE OF HIM IN WHOSE NAME THE CHURCH ITSELF EXISTS AS WELL AS THEIR OFFICE IN IT
THIS COMMAND HAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS VALUE THAN ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AND THE MAN WHO THROUGH WEAKNESS TRANSGRESSES ANY COMMAND WHATEVER THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE INCLUDED DOES NOT CEASE TO BE A CHRISTIAN IF HE HOLD THE TRUE FAITH
MEN CANNOT KNOW WHEN THE DAY AND THE HOUR OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD WILL COME BECAUSE ITS COMING DEPENDS ON THEMSELVES ALONE
HE KNOWS THAT ALL THE HABITS IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP AND WHICH HE COULD NOT GIVE UP WITHOUT SUFFERING CAN ONLY BE SATISFIED THROUGH THE EXHAUSTING OFTEN FATAL TOIL OF OPPRESSED LABORERS THAT IS THROUGH THE MOST OBVIOUS AND BRUTAL VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY HUMANITY AND JUSTICE AND EVEN OF SCIENCE THAT IS ECONOMIC SCIENCE HE ADVOCATES THE PRINCIPLES OF FRATERNITY HUMANITY JUSTICE AND SCIENCE AND YET HE LIVES SO THAT HE IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPPRESSION OF THE WORKING CLASSES WHICH HE DENOUNCES AND HIS WHOLE LIFE IS BASED ON THE ADVANTAGES GAINED BY THEIR OPPRESSION
IF THE WORLD TOLERATES THEM THEY ARE ALWAYS HAPPY
USE OF FORCE NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN EVIL DOERS--3D REPLY
POLICE OFFICERS AND DETECTIVES ARE CONTINUALLY ASSISTING THE ESCAPE OF THOSE THEY OUGHT TO ARREST
NOT AT ALL HIS OATH OF FIDELITY AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE TZAR
ON THE CONTRARY WHEN ALL HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AND THEY ARE TO BE LET OUT AGAIN THE MILITARY OFFICER GOES WITH A CONFIDENT AND MAJESTIC AIR INTO THE HALL WHERE THE DRUNKEN CHEATED LADS ARE SHUT UP AND CRIES IN A BOLD MILITARY VOICE
YET AT THE SAME TIME EVERYONE SEES ALL ROUND HIM THE DIVISION OF MEN INTO TWO CASTES--THE ONE LABORING OPPRESSED POOR AND SUFFERING THE OTHER IDLE OPPRESSING LUXURIOUS AND PROFLIGATE
WHEREFORE WE COMMIT THE KEEPING OF OUR SOULS TO GOD
A TAX IS LEVIED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND IS EXACTED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE WILL OF THE SUBJECT
UNTIL OUR WARRIORS ARE DISARMED AND OUR ARMIES DISBANDED THE HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO CALL OURSELVES A CHRISTIAN NATION IN A CONFERENCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DUTY OF CHRISTIAN MINISTERS TO PREACH AGAINST WAR G
AND WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY PUBLIC OPINION CAN BE DESTROYED BY PUBLIC OPINION--AND INDEED IS BEING DESTROYED BY PUBLIC OPINION
DEAR SIR HE WRITES
WE KNOW ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND ARE USED TO IT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO BEHAVE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS
ALREADY RULING GOVERNMENTS FEEL THEIR WEAK AND DEFENSELESS POSITION AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES ARE AWAKENING FROM THEIR APATHY AND ALREADY BEGIN TO FEEL THEIR POWER
SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY IS THE EVIL THEREOF LUKE XII
DEPRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS TAKE FROM THEM THE HAPPINESS FOR WHICH THEY LIVE
IT IS AN ENORMOUS FACT WHICH THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF HIDING AND ABOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO DISPUTING
AND IN THE CORRUPT TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY WERE NOT THESE VERY MEN CAST OUT DENOUNCED BY THE HYPOCRITES AND ENVIOUS WHO WERE ENDOWED BY GOD WITH GREAT GIFTS AND WHO WOULD IN THE DAYS OF PURE CHRISTIANITY HAVE BEEN HELD IN HIGH HONOR
IT CANNOT BE TRUE THEN THAT THIS COMMAND IS RECOGNIZED BY THE PREACHERS OF THE CHURCH AS ON A LEVEL WITH OTHER COMMANDS
KOMAROVSKY FERRI BOOTH PASSY LAWSON WILSON BARTLETT DEFOURNEY MONETA--THE STRIKING CHARACTER OF THE MILITARY CONTRADICTION
SO THAT ACCORDING TO THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH ARE CATHOLICS
BUT A THINKING MAN HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONTACT--AS CONSTANTLY HAPPENS IN THESE DAYS--WITH PEOPLE EQUALLY GOOD AND BAD OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS WHO CONDEMN EACH OTHER'S BELIEFS TO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH OF THE BELIEF HE PROFESSES HIMSELF
NOUS NE POUVONS PARTAGER CE SCRUPULE CAR IL N'IRAIT A RIEN MOINS QU'A ENLEVER AU CHRISTIANISME TOUT CARACTERE DISTINCTIF SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
ALL THOSE STATEMENTS ARE SO UTTERLY UNTRUE AND UNFOUNDED THAT ONE IS ASHAMED TO REFUTE THEM
THE HIGHER CLASSES SEE THE UNIONS THE STRIKES THE MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS AND FEEL THE CALAMITY THAT IS THREATENING THEM AND THEIR TERROR PASSES INTO AN INSTINCT OF SELF-DEFENSE AND HATRED
ANOTHER IS LOOKING THROUGH SOME PAPERS
AT FIRST THEY WERE ENROLLED IN THE AMBULANCE CORPS BUT NOW AS THEIR NUMBERS INCREASE THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO PUNISHMENT FOR NON-COMPLIANCE BUT THEY STILL REFUSE TO BEAR ARMS JUST THE SAME
PEOPLE USED TO SAY THEN
HIS RELIGION CONSISTS IN PROPITIATING HIS DEITY AND IN WORSHIPING HIS GODS WHOM HE IMAGINES AS PERSONS LIVING ONLY FOR THEIR PERSONAL AIMS
WERE IT MY OBJECT TO PROVE HOW UNTENABLE IS THE DOCTRINE OF COMMUNISM BASED BY COUNT TOLSTOY UPON THE DIVINE PARADOXES SIC WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED ONLY ON HISTORICAL PRINCIPLES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WHOLE METHOD OF THE TEACHING OF JESUS IT WOULD REQUIRE AN AMPLER CANVAS THAN I HAVE HERE AT MY DISPOSAL WHAT A PITY HE HAS NOT AN AMPLER CANVAS AT HIS DISPOSAL
THE TRUE LIFE ACCORDING TO PRECEDING RELIGIONS CONSISTS IN CARRYING OUT RULES THE LAW
IN THE SAME WAY UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE DESTROYS ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE SOCIAL ORDER OF LIFE WHICH IT IS EMPLOYED TO MAINTAIN
LET THE MURDERERS SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF STATE VIOLENCE SET US THE EXAMPLE BY GIVING UP MURDER AND THEN WE WILL GIVE IT UP BUT THE MURDERERS SAY JUST THE SAME ONLY WITH MUCH MORE RIGHT
HOWEVER COMMONPLACE AND OUT OF DATE IT MAY SEEM TO US HOWEVER CONFUSED WE MAY BE BY HYPOCRISY AND BY THE HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION WHICH RESULTS FROM IT NOTHING CAN DESTROY THE CERTAINTY OF THIS SIMPLE AND CLEARLY DEFINED TRUTH
AND IN THE CHURCH THERE ARE ONLY PROTESTANTS
THE CHIEF AND MOST PERNICIOUS WORK OF THE CHURCH IS THAT WHICH IS DIRECTED TO THE DECEPTION OF CHILDREN--THESE VERY CHILDREN OF WHOM CHRIST SAID
BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SOLITARY EXAMPLES OF THIS RECOGNITION OF THE EMPTINESS AND EVIL OF POWER
THE GOVERNOR IN SPITE OF ALL THE STUPEFYING EFFECT OF HIS SURROUNDINGS CANNOT HELP HESITATING WHEN THE MOMENT COMES TO GIVE FINAL DECISIVE COMMAND
ONE MAY OFTEN NOWADAYS HEAR FROM PERSONS IN AUTHORITY THE NAIVE COMPLAINT THAT THE BEST PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS BY SOME STRANGE--AS IT SEEMS TO THEM--FATALITY TO BE FOUND IN THE CAMP OF THE OPPOSITION
THE SOLE ESCAPE FROM IT FOR THEM LIES IN THEIR HOPE THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE BY USING THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH OF ANTIQUITY AND OF THEIR SACRED OFFICE TO OVERAWE THE READER AND DRAW HIM AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF READING THE GOSPEL FOR HIMSELF AND THINKING OUT THE QUESTION IN HIS OWN MIND FOR HIMSELF
AND THEREFORE EUROPE IS SO RUINED THAT IF PRIVATE PERSONS WERE IN THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF OUR CONTINENT THE RICHEST OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON
THEY FORGET THAT THE LOVE WHICH THEY ARE DISCUSSING IS A PERSONAL LOVE WHICH MIGHT EXPAND IN A RAREFIED FORM TO EMBRACE A MAN'S NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHICH DISAPPEARS BEFORE IT CAN EMBRACE AN ARTIFICIAL STATE SUCH AS AUSTRIA ENGLAND OR TURKEY AND WHICH WE CANNOT EVEN CONCEIVE OF IN RELATION TO ALL HUMANITY AN ABSOLUTELY MYSTIC CONCEPTION
STILL THEY COULD PROVE IT IF THEY WANTED TO
THE FIFTH KIND OF ANSWER WHICH IS THE SUBTLEST THE MOST OFTEN USED AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE CONSISTS IN AVOIDING ANSWERING IN MAKING BELIEVE THAT THIS QUESTION IS ONE WHICH HAS LONG AGO BEEN DECIDED PERFECTLY CLEARLY AND SATISFACTORILY AND THAT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO TALK ABOUT IT
AT EVERY NEW STRUGGLE THAT ARISES ONE MUST INEVITABLY DECIDE
IT IS PARTICULARLY ASTONISHING THAT THESE BOOKS SHOULD BE UNKNOWN BECAUSE APART FROM THEIR INTRINSIC MERITS BOTH BOOKS TREAT NOT SO MUCH OF THE THEORY AS OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE THEORY TO LIFE OF THE ATTITUDE OF CHRISTIANITY TO MILITARY SERVICE WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING NOW IN THESE CLAYS OF UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION
MEN KNOW NOW OR ARE NOT FAR FROM KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND FOR WHAT OBJECT THEY DO IT
TRUE FAITH CONSISTS IN BELIEVING GOD'S WORD
AND IF THERE ARE NOW RULERS WHO DO NOT DECIDE ON ANY STEP ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY WHO TRY TO BE AS UNLIKE MONARCHS AND AS LIKE PLAIN MORTALS AS POSSIBLE WHO STATE THEIR READINESS TO GIVE UP THEIR PREROGATIVES AND BECOME SIMPLY THE FIRST CITIZENS OF A REPUBLIC
THE IMPRESSION I GAINED OF A DESIRE TO CONCEAL TO HUSH UP WHAT I HAD TRIED TO EXPRESS IN MY BOOK LED ME TO JUDGE THE BOOK ITSELF AFRESH
IT MAINTAINS AMONG MEN ALL THE GREAT AND NOBLE SENTIMENTS--HONOR DEVOTION VIRTUE AND COURAGE AND SAVES THEM IN SHORT FROM FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM SO THEN BRINGING MILLIONS OF MEN TOGETHER INTO HERDS MARCHING BY DAY AND BY NIGHT WITHOUT REST THINKING OF NOTHING STUDYING NOTHING LEARNING NOTHING READING NOTHING BEING USEFUL TO NO ONE WALLOWING IN FILTH SLEEPING IN MUD LIVING LIKE BRUTES IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF STUPEFACTION SACKING TOWNS BURNING VILLAGES RUINING WHOLE POPULATIONS THEN MEETING ANOTHER MASS OF HUMAN FLESH FALLING UPON THEM MAKING POOLS OF BLOOD AND PLAINS OF FLESH MIXED WITH TRODDEN MIRE AND RED WITH HEAPS OF CORPSES HAVING YOUR ARMS OR LEGS CARRIED OFF YOUR BRAINS BLOWN OUT FOR NO ADVANTAGE TO ANYONE AND DYING IN SOME CORNER OF A FIELD WHILE YOUR OLD PARENTS YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN ARE PERISHING OF HUNGER--THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY NOT FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM
10
WE FEEL OURSELVES ALL THE BURDENSOMENESS OF LIFE AS IT IS
AFTER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OF EDUCATION IN CHRISTIANITY THE CIVILIZED WORLD AS REPRESENTED BY ITS MOST ADVANCED THINKERS HOLDS THE CONVICTION THAT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS A RELIGION OF DOGMAS
SOME OF THEM FORM CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SHARES ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE OTHERS
BUT A POLICE CONSTABLE WHOM THE GOVERNOR ALWAYS TOOK ABOUT WITH HIM AND WHO UNDERTOOK TO ORGANIZE SUCH EXECUTIONS--BY NO MEANS EXCEPTIONAL IN THAT PROVINCE--EXPLAINED THAT WHAT WAS MEANT WAS A BENCH FOR FLOGGING
THEY OPPOSED IT AND ATTACKED IT AND ADVANCING WITH GREAT HEAT ARGUMENTS WHICH HAD LONG AGO BEEN ANALYZED AND REFUTED FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW THEY DEMONSTRATED THAT A MAN OUGHT INVARIABLY TO DEFEND WITH VIOLENCE ALL THE INJURED AND OPPRESSED AND THAT THUS THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL IS AN IMMORAL DOCTRINE
THE EXISTENCE OF WHOLE NATIONALITIES WOULD BE AT STAKE AND THEREFORE THE WAR WOULD BE DESPERATE BLOODY ATROCIOUS
BUT THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS WORKS OF HIS LATER YEARS HAVE MET WITH A SOMEWHAT INDIFFERENT RECEPTION
IT IS DONE 1 BY INSTILLING BY EXAMPLE AND DIRECT INSTRUCTION FROM CHILDHOOD UP INTO THE WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT TIME TO STUDY MORAL AND RELIGIOUS QUESTIONS FOR THEMSELVES THE IDEA THAT TORTURE AND MURDER ARE COMPATIBLE WITH CHRISTIANITY AND THAT FOR CERTAIN OBJECTS OF STATE TORTURE AND MURDER ARE NOT ONLY ADMISSIBLE BUT OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED
WAR HAS CEASED TO BE SOMETHING DEPENDENT ON MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
POUR DIRE QUE LE GNOSTICISME OU L'EBIONITISME SONT LES FORMES LEGITIMES DE LA PENSEE CHRETIENNE IL FAUT DIRE HARDIMENT QU'IL N'Y A PAS DE PENSEE CHRETIENNE NI DE CARACTERE SPECIFIQUE QUI LA FASSE RECONNAITRE
THIS FINE HE ALSO DECLINED VOLUNTARILY TO PAY
NOW I WILL SPEAK OF THE OTHER VIEW OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH HINDERS THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF IT--THE SCIENTIFIC VIEW
SOME TRUTHS HAVE BEEN SO ASSIMILATED BY THEM THAT THEY HAVE BECOME THE UNCONSCIOUS BASIS OF ACTION OTHERS ARE ONLY JUST ON THE POINT OF BEING REVEALED TO HIM AND A THIRD CLASS THOUGH NOT YET ASSIMILATED BY HIM HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WITH SUFFICIENT CLEARNESS TO FORCE HIM TO DECIDE EITHER TO RECOGNIZE THEM OR TO REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THEM
AND IT IS PRECISELY THIS INSTINCT WHICH LEADS ALL MEN WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS TO SUPPORT ALL THE RELIGIOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
I CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT AND THEREFORE I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS MISDEEDS
THE LEARNED JURISTS WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO JUSTIFY THE VIOLENCE OF AUTHORITY ARE MORE AND MORE DISPOSED TO DENY THE RIGHT OF PUNISHMENT AND TO REPLACE IT BY THEORIES OF IRRESPONSIBILITY AND EVEN OF MORAL INSANITY PROPOSING TO DEAL WITH THOSE THEY CALL CRIMINALS BY MEDICAL TREATMENT ONLY
SO IT WAS UNDER THE ROMAN EMPERORS AND SO IT IS NOW
AN EXAMPLE
WE ANTICIPATE NO SMALL AMOUNT OF MISCONCEPTION MISREPRESENTATION AND CALUMNY
HENCE HE REJECTS THE CHIEF DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH--THAT OF THE ATONEMENT BY BLOOD THE TRINITY THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST ON THE APOSTLES AND HIS TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE PRIESTHOOD AND HE RECOGNIZES ONLY THE WORDS AND COMMANDS OF CHRIST
AND IT FELL NOT FOR IT WAS FOUNDED UPON A ROCK
NEXT ONE AND THE MUTILATED VICTIM HIS BACK COVERED WITH BLOOD WAS LIFTED UP AND CARRIED AWAY UNCONSCIOUS AND ANOTHER WAS LED UP
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE ARE MANY PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO REFUSE TO FIGHT ON GROUNDS OF CONSCIENCE
BUT IT MAY HAPPEN AND IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO SO
WHEN CANNIBALISM IS SPOKEN OF WE SMILE WITH PRIDE PROCLAIMING OUR SUPERIORITY TO THESE SAVAGES
8 OF THE REVUE DES REVUES 1891
IT IS BEGETTING OR AT LEAST SETTING FREE AND INCITING THAT EVIL SPIRIT WHICH WE SHOULD WISH TO DRIVE OUT
DON'T TELL ME THAT THEY ARE SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
YOU CAN CUT US TO PIECES AND WE WILL NOT BE SOLDIERS
THUS IT IS THAT THE RULING AUTHORITIES ARE IN SUCH A DEFENSELESS POSITION BEFORE MEN WHO ADVOCATE CHRISTIANITY THAT BUT LITTLE IS NECESSARY TO OVERTHROW THIS SOVEREIGN POWER WHICH SEEMS SO POWERFUL AND HAS HELD SUCH AN EXALTED POSITION FOR SO MANY CENTURIES
AND IF ONE MAN MAY NOT BUY OF ANOTHER A COMMODITY FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF A CERTAIN FIXED LINE CALLED THE FRONTIER WITHOUT PAYING CERTAIN DUTIES ON IT TO MEN WHO HAVE TAKEN NO PART WHATEVER IN ITS PRODUCTION--AND IF MEN ARE DRIVEN TO SELL THEIR LAST COW TO PAY TAXES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTES AMONG ITS FUNCTIONARIES AND SPENDS ON MAINTAINING SOLDIERS TO MURDER THESE VERY TAXPAYERS--IT WOULD APPEAR SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL THIS DOES NOT COME ABOUT AS THE RESULT OF ANY ABSTRACT LAWS BUT IS BASED ON JUST WHAT WAS DONE IN OREL AND WHICH MAY BE DONE IN TOULA AND IS DONE PERIODICALLY IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD WHEREVER THERE IS A GOVERNMENT AND WHERE THERE ARE RICH AND POOR
THERE IS NO OTHER FREEDOM--RECOGNITION OF TRUTH GIVES FREEDOM AND SHOWS THE PATH ALONG WHICH WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY BY MANKIND MAN MUST ADVANCE--THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH AND REAL FREEDOM ENABLES MAN TO SHARE IN THE WORK OF GOD NOT AS THE SLAVE BUT AS THE CREATOR OF LIFE--MEN NEED ONLY MAKE THE EFFORT TO RENOUNCE ALL THOUGHT OF BETTERING THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND BEND ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO RECOGNIZING AND PREACHING THE TRUTH THEY KNOW TO PUT AN END TO THE EXISTING MISERABLE STATE OF THINGS AND TO ENTER UPON THE KINGDOM OF GOD SO FAR AS IT IS YET ACCESSIBLE TO MAN--ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS TO MAKE AN END OF LYING AND HYPOCRISY--BUT THEN WHAT AWAITS US IN THE FUTURE?--WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HUMANITY IF MEN FOLLOW THE DICTATES OF THEIR CONSCIENCE AND HOW CAN LIFE GO ON WITH THE CONDITIONS OF CIVILIZED LIFE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED
AS A REAL HISTORICAL FACT THERE HAS EXISTED AND STILL EXIST SEVERAL BODIES OF MEN EACH ASSERTING THAT IT IS THE ONE CHURCH FOUNDED BY CHRIST AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES CHURCHES ARE ONLY SECTS AND HERESIES
THE MEN INVESTED WITH RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY REGARDED AS EVIL WHAT THE MEN AND INSTITUTIONS INVESTED WITH TEMPORAL AUTHORITY REGARDED AS GOOD AND VICE VERSA AND THE STRUGGLE GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE
EVERY DEGREE OF PERFECTION AND EVERY DEGREE OF IMPERFECTION ARE EQUAL IN IT
IN MEN IT TAKES THE FORM OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE SO TRULY EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL THEY HAVE LOVED DARKNESS BETTER THAN LIGHT BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL THIS PRINCIPLE SHOWS ITSELF IN MEN NOT TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH BUT TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THE LIFE THEY ARE LEADING WHICH IS WHAT THEY LIKE AND ARE USED TO IS A LIFE PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH TRUTH
THESE MEN HAVE FRIENDS AND A PAST
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU BY GRAF LEO TOLSTOY
BREACH FOR BREACH EYE FOR EYE TOOTH FOR TOOTH."--LEV
AND WHAT IS THE USE OF TAX COLLECTORS WHO COLLECT THE TAXES UNWILLINGLY WHEN IT IS EASY TO RAISE ALL THAT IS WANTED WITHOUT THEM
THEIR DISUNION RESULTS FROM THEIR NOT FOLLOWING THE TRUTH WHICH IS ONE BUT FALSEHOODS WHICH ARE MANY
AS CHRIST'S DISCIPLES SAID EIGHTEEN CENTURIES AGO
BUT THEIR CONSCIENCE IS MUTE
INDEED THEY ONLY ASSUMED THIS BOLD AND COMPOSED MANNER TO CONCEAL THE WAVERING WITHIN
WERE THE INVASIONS OF THE BARBARIANS WHAT SAVED AND REGENERATED ROME
THE SKIN SMOKES AND SCORCHES BUT THE SLEEPER DOES NOT AWAKE
WE HAVE SEEN MEN SHOOT INNOCENT CREATURES FOUND ON THE ROAD AND SUSPECTED BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID
BUT OWING TO THE PERFECTION TO WHICH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE ARMY HAS BEEN BROUGHT THERE IS NO LIMIT TO CHECK MEN WHO FORM PART OF A REGULARLY ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT
THE FAMILY THE TRIBE EVEN THE STATE WERE NOT INVENTED BY MEN BUT FORMED THEMSELVES SPONTANEOUSLY LIKE ANT-HILLS OR SWARMS OF BEES AND HAVE A REAL EXISTENCE
IF THIS STANDARD ALREADY INFLUENCES SOME THE MOST IMPRESSIONABLE AND IMPELS EACH IN HIS OWN SPHERE TO ABANDON ADVANTAGES BASED ON THE USE OF FORCE THEN ITS INFLUENCE WILL EXTEND FURTHER AND FURTHER TILL IT TRANSFORMS THE WHOLE ORDER OF MEN'S ACTIONS AND PUTS IT INTO ACCORD WITH THE CHRISTIAN IDEAL WHICH IS ALREADY A LIVING FORCE IN THE VANGUARD OF HUMANITY
THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE COULD BE JUSTIFIED ONLY SO LONG AS ALL MEN VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICED THEIR PERSONAL INTERESTS TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE
WAR IS NOT MADE NOW BECAUSE ONE KING HAS BEEN WANTING IN CIVILITY TO THE MISTRESS OF ANOTHER KING AS IT WAS IN LOUIS XIV.'S TIME
PHRASE QUOTED FROM VICTOR-HUGO NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS THAT THE UNION OF THE NATIONS THROUGH SCIENCE AND LABOR WILL OVERCOME THE INSTINCT OF WAR
IN THE CROWD STANDING ROUND WERE HEARD THE SOBS OF WIVES MOTHERS CHILDREN THE FAMILIES OF THE TORTURED MAN AND OF ALL THE OTHERS PICKED OUT FOR PUNISHMENT
ITS GENERAL TENOR IS GIVEN WITH PERFECT ACCURACY BY PYPIN
IF THE MAJORITY OF MEN CHOOSE TO SUBMIT RATHER THAN TO REFUSE IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF SOBER BALANCING OF ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE INDUCED BY A KIND OF HYPNOTIZING PROCESS PRACTICED UPON THEM
AND THESE PEOPLE HAVE SO ENTERED INTO THEIR PART THAT THEY SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THEY REALLY ARE WHAT THEY PRETEND TO BE
NO HOSTILITIES TO BE COMMENCED ETC
CHRISTIANITY PENETRATES TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MEN NOT ONLY IN SPITE OF THE VIOLENCE OF POWER BUT ALSO BY MEANS OF IT
TO DUPE THEM INTO BELIEVING THAT THIS IS THEIR DUTY TO GOD IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THEIR REFUSAL IS BASED ON THE CLEAR UNMISTAKABLE LAW OF GOD RECOGNIZED EVEN BY THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPEL MEN TO ACT AGAINST IT
IT WAS PLAINLY SAID NOT THAT WHICH GOETH INTO A MAN'S MOUTH BUT THAT WHICH COMETH OUT OF A MAN'S MOUTH DEFILETH HIM AND THEREFORE THE QUESTION OF BAPTIZING THE UNCIRCUMCISED COULD ONLY HAVE ARISEN AMONG MEN WHO THOUGH THEY LOVED THEIR MASTER AND DIMLY FELT THE GRANDEUR OF HIS TEACHING STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TEACHING ITSELF VERY CLEARLY
BUT THIS CONTRADICTION IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONFRONTS US WHEN WE TURN TO INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS AND WHICH DEMANDS A SOLUTION UNDER PAIN OF THE LOSS OF THE SANITY AND EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE HUMAN RACE
PARTICIPATION IN ELECTION GOVERNMENT OR LAW BUSINESS IS PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT BY FORCE
A NEW PLAGUE IS SPREADING THROUGHOUT EUROPE
AND UNTIL THESE HAVE BEEN REMOVED NO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE
I WROTE TO BALLOU AND HE ANSWERED ME AND SENT ME HIS WORKS
AND TO FORM A RATIONAL MORAL SOCIETY OF SUCH MEN IS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE A TASK
IF FIFTY YEARS AGO THE IDLE RICH MAN AND THE ILLITERATE LABORER WERE BOTH ALIKE CONVINCED THAT THEIR STATE OF EVERLASTING HOLIDAY FOR ONE AND EVERLASTING TOIL FOR THE OTHER WAS ORDAINED BY GOD HIMSELF WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT NOWADAYS THANKS TO THE GROWTH OF POPULATION AND THE DIFFUSION OF BOOKS AND EDUCATION IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND IN EUROPE OR EVEN IN RUSSIA EITHER AMONG RICH OR POOR A MAN TO WHOM IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER A DOUBT AS TO THE JUSTICE OF THIS STATE OF THINGS HAD NEVER PRESENTED ITSELF
1 OF THOSE WHO MAKE HERETICS
WILL NOT HARM COME IF BEING WHOLLY IN THE POWER OF A MASTER I CARRY OUT IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED AND DIRECTED BY HIM THE ORDERS HE GIVES ME STRANGE THOUGH THEY MAY SEEM TO ME WHO DO NOT KNOW THE MASTER'S FINAL AIMS
A FOURTH THEY SENT TO A LUNATIC ASYLUM
SO MEN SUBMITTING TO WHAT IS DISADVANTAGEOUS OR EVEN RUINOUS TO THEM AND CONSIDERED BY THEM AS UNJUST ACT THUS BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER WHAT THEY SUFFERED FOR RESISTING IT
I HOLD WITH JOSEPH DE MAISTRE THAT IT IS A DIVINE LAW
AND THE MISDEEDS OF OUR RULERS BECOME OUR OWN IF WE KNOWING THAT THEY ARE MISDEEDS ASSIST IN CARRYING THEM OUT
IT ATTRACTS ME BY A KIND OF FASCINATION OF REPULSION
THE TEACHING IS NO USE FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL AGE PRECISELY AS THOUGH THE EXISTENCE OF THIS INDUSTRIAL AGE WERE A SACRED FACT WHICH OUGHT NOT TO AND COULD NOT BE CHANGED
ALL THE DIFFICULTY AND SEEMING INSOLUBILITY OF THE QUESTION OF THE FREEDOM OF MAN RESULTS FROM THOSE WHO TRIED TO SOLVE THE QUESTION IMAGINING MAN AS STATIONARY IN HIS RELATION TO THE TRUTH
MEN HAVE LONG BEEN LIVING IN ANTAGONISM TO THEIR CONSCIENCE
THE OPPRESSORS THAT IS THOSE WHO TAKE PART IN GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHO PROFIT BY OPPRESSION THAT IS THE RICH NO LONGER IMAGINE AS THEY ONCE DID THAT THEY ARE THE ELECT OF THE WORLD AND THAT THEY CONSTITUTE THE IDEAL OF HUMAN HAPPINESS AND GREATNESS TO ATTAIN WHICH WAS ONCE THE HIGHEST AIM OF THE OPPRESSED
IN THE TIMES OF CONSTANTINE THE WHOLE INTERPRETATION OF THE DOCTRINE HAD BEEN ALREADY REDUCED TO A RESUME--SUPPORTED BY THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY--OF THE DISPUTES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUNCIL--TO A CREED WHICH RECKONED OFF--I BELIEVE IN SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO TO THE END--TO ONE HOLY APOSTOLIC CHURCH WHICH MEANS THE INFALLIBILITY OF THOSE PERSONS WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE CHURCH
THE EXISTING ORDER IS MAINTAINED NOT BY FORCE BUT BY PUBLIC OPINION THE ACTION OF WHICH IS DISTURBED BY THE USE OF FORCE
THE OBJECT OF AUTHORITY AND THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS EXISTENCE LIE IN THE RESTRAINT OF THOSE WHO AIM AT ATTAINING THEIR PERSONAL INTERESTS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
THOSE WHO CONSECRATE THEIR LIVES SELF-SACRIFICINGLY TO THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY ARE REGARDED AS THE BEST MEN
ON THE CONTRARY ALWAYS HAVING TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST ITS DISPOSSESSED AND EXASPERATED ENEMIES IT WOULD BE MORE DESPOTIC AND CRUEL AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE RULE IN ALL REVOLUTIONS
SIDOROV HAS ALREADY HEARD THE NEWS AND CAN SEE FROM HIS FACE TOO THAT HE HAS BEEN TAKEN
IT WENT THROUGH VARIOUS FORMS AND HAS NOW PASSED INTO THE REGION OF THE INSTINCTIVE THROUGH INHERITANCE EDUCATION AND HABIT
BEFORE A LECTERN WHO WEARS THE GOLDEN CROSS AND HAS A GOSPEL BOUND IN GOLD
OR LIKE SHEEP WHO TERRIFIED BY THEIR BARN BEING ON FIRE HUDDLE IN A CORNER AND DO NOT GO OUT OF THE WIDE-OPEN DOOR
THE LANDOWNER COMPLAINED TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE NEGLECT ON THE PART OF THE POLICE AND THE LATTER WITHOUT EXAMINING INTO THE AFFAIR GAVE THE CHIEF OFFICIAL OF THE POLICE STRICT ORDERS TO CARRY OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE DISTRICT COMMANDER WITHOUT DELAY
A MAN WHO HAS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL ENTERED THE POLICE FORCE AT A WAGE OF TEN RUBLES WHICH HE COULD EASILY EARN IN ANY OTHER POSITION IS HARDLY DEPENDENT ON THE PRESERVATION OF THE EXISTING REGIME AND SO HE MAY NOT BELIEVE IN ITS IMMUTABILITY
BUT CAN A MAN MAKE THIS EFFORT
THAT IS TO SAY IF AFTER RECOGNIZING A NEW TRUTH MAN ALWAYS REMAINED AT THE SAME STAGE OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT
LET A MAN BUT REALIZE THAT THE AIM OF HIS LIFE IS THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S LAW AND THAT LAW WILL REPLACE ALL OTHER LAWS FOR HIM AND HE WILL GIVE IT HIS SOLE ALLEGIANCE SO THAT BY THAT VERY ALLEGIANCE EVERY HUMAN LAW WILL LOSE ALL BINDING AND CONTROLLING POWER IN HIS EYES
LET US RECOGNIZE THEN THAT IF A RELIGION OR A DOCTRINE EXISTS WHICH IS CALLED CHRISTIANITY IT MAY HAVE ITS HERESIES THE AUTHOR'S WHOLE ARGUMENT AMOUNTS TO THIS
YET I KNOW ALL THESE MEN
IT IS INSTILLED INTO ANOTHER SET OF MEN BY EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS THAT THEY ARE INFERIOR TO OTHERS AND THEREFORE MUST SUBMIT WITHOUT A MURMUR TO EVERY ORDER GIVEN THEM BY THEIR SUPERIORS
THAT IS JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW TO HUMANITY AT THIS TIME OF TRANSITION THROUGH WHICH WE ARE PASSING FROM THE PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO THE CHRISTIAN
IN THESE LETTERS EXPRESSING THEIR SYMPATHY WITH MY VIEWS ON THE UNLAWFULNESS FOR A CHRISTIAN OF WAR AND THE USE OF FORCE OF ANY KIND THE QUAKERS GAVE ME DETAILS OF THEIR OWN SO-CALLED SECT WHICH FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAS ACTUALLY PROFESSED THE TEACHING OF CHRIST ON NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE AND DOES NOT MAKE USE OF WEAPONS IN SELF-DEFENSE
THE THIRD CATEGORY CONSISTS OF MEN WHO HAVE LOST ALL CONSCIENCE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL COMMON SENSE AND FEELING OF HUMANITY
THIS IS THE CASE WITH ALL MEN IN AUTHORITY WHO OCCUPY POSITIONS MORE PROFITABLE THAN THEY COULD OCCUPY EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENT REGIME FROM THE LOWEST POLICE OFFICER TO THE TZAR
AS A CHARACTERISTIC EXAMPLE OF SUCH CRITICISMS I WILL QUOTE THE ARTICLE OF A WELL-KNOWN AND INGENIOUS ENGLISH WRITER AND PREACHER--FARRAR--WHO LIKE MANY LEARNED THEOLOGIANS IS A GREAT MASTER OF THE ART OF CIRCUITOUSLY EVADING A QUESTION
EUROPE KEEPS MORE SOLDIERS UNDER ARMS TO-DAY THAN IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT NAPOLEONIC WARS
BUT IT WILL BE SAID AT ALL TIMES IN ALL SOCIETIES THE MAJORITY OF PERSONS--ALL THE CHILDREN ALL THE WOMEN ABSORBED IN THE BEARING AND REARING OF THE YOUNG ALL THE GREAT MASS OF THE LABORING POPULATION WHO ARE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF INCESSANT AND FATIGUING PHYSICAL LABOR ALL THOSE OF WEAK CHARACTER BY NATURE ALL THOSE WHO ARE ABNORMALLY ENFEEBLED INTELLECTUALLY BY THE EFFECTS OF NICOTINE ALCOHOL OPIUM OR OTHER INTOXICANTS--ARE ALWAYS IN A CONDITION OF INCAPACITY FOR INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND ARE EITHER IN SUBJECTION TO THOSE WHO ARE ON A HIGHER INTELLECTUAL LEVEL OR ELSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FAMILY OR SOCIAL TRADITIONS OF WHAT IS CALLED PUBLIC OPINION AND THERE IS NOTHING UNNATURAL OR INCONGRUOUS IN THEIR SUBJECTION AND TRULY THERE IS NOTHING UNNATURAL IN IT AND THE TENDENCY OF MEN OF SMALL INTELLECTUAL POWER TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THOSE ON A HIGHER LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE IS A CONSTANT LAW AND IT IS OWING TO IT THAT MEN CAN LIVE IN SOCIETIES AND ON THE SAME
ON EACH OF THESE POINTS HE PROPOUNDS TEN MORE QUESTIONS THE ANSWERS TO WHICH HE GIVES LATER ON FROM THE WORKS OF WELL-KNOWN THEOLOGIANS
THE LAST THE MOST EXTREME TEST IS PUT BEFORE MEN IN ITS COARSEST FORM
AND AS THE INDIVIDUAL MAN WHEN HE ATTAINS A FRESH STAGE OF GROWTH INEVITABLY CHANGES HIS PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND THE GROWN-UP MAN SEES A DIFFERENT MEANING IN IT FROM THE CHILD SO TOO ASSOCIATIONS OF MEN--NATIONS--ARE BOUND TO CHANGE THEIR PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND THE CONDUCT ENSUING FROM THEIR PHILOSOPHY TO CORRESPOND WITH THEIR DEVELOPMENT
IT MIGHT DO YOU GOOD
AND THEREFORE WE CONSIDER IT THE DUTY OF EVERY MAN WHO THINKS WAR INCONSISTENT WITH CHRISTIANITY MEEKLY BUT FIRMLY TO REFUSE TO SERVE IN THE ARMY
THIS IS ACCORDINGLY DONE
HIS RELIGION CONSISTS IN THE EXALTATION OF THE GLORY OF THOSE WHO ARE ALLIED TO HIM--THE FOUNDERS OF HIS FAMILY HIS ANCESTORS HIS RULERS--AND IN WORSHIPING GODS WHO ARE EXCLUSIVELY PROTECTORS OF HIS CLAN HIS FAMILY HIS NATION HIS GOVERNMENT SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
IF WE CANNOT OCCUPY A SEAT IN THE LEGISLATURE OR ON THE BENCH NEITHER CAN WE ELECT OTHERS TO ACT AS OUR SUBSTITUTES IN ANY SUCH CAPACITY
BUT AS GUARD JUDGE GENERAL GOVERNOR TZAR OR SOLDIER IT IS MY DUTY TO KILL OR TORTURE HIM JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE SOME POSITIONS CONFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHICH WOULD EXONERATE US FROM THE OBLIGATIONS LAID ON EACH OF US BY THE FACT OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY
ALL THIS TIME THROUGH ALL THESE CHANGES FROM PLACE TO PLACE THE YOUNG MAN IS ROUGHLY TREATED KEPT IN COLD HUNGER AND FILTH AND LIFE IS MADE BURDENSOME TO HIM GENERALLY
HE NOW BELIEVES THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD WOULD COME IF ALL MEN KEPT THESE FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF CHRIST VIZ
ALL THE MATERIAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT RELIGIOUS AND SCIENTIFIC MEN CAN DREAM OF MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED
SOME--THE DETERMINISTS--CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT OF FREEDOM SO TRIFLING THAT THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AT ALL
AND THE LAND IS FILLED ACCORDINGLY WITH GIBBETS PRISONS ARSENALS SHIPS OF WAR AND SOLDIERS
MEANWHILE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY TO POINT OUT AT LEAST SOME KIND OF SOLUTION OF THE FOLLOWING QUESTION SINCE IT IS AT THE ROOT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTS US
BUT IT IS NOT EVEN THIS QUESTION WHAT WILL HAPPEN THAT AGITATES MEN WHEN THEY HESITATE TO FULFILL THE MASTER'S WILL
AND SO ALL KINDS OF SHIFTS AND WILES AND CRUELTIES ARE SET ON FOOT AGAINST HIM
AND THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY EXCLUDE THE OBLIGATION OF LOVE AND SERVICE OF GOD HOLDING THAT THE DOCTRINE OF LOVE FOR MEN FOR HUMANITY ALONE IS FAR MORE CLEAR TANGIBLE AND REASONABLE
THERE IS THE STATEMENT OF THE SAME LAW IN BOTH EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT FORMULAS
HE NEED ONLY MAKE A MORAL EFFORT
THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN PROFESSED BY A MINORITY OF MEN FROM THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY II
THE TIME HAS COME WHEN THE EVER-GROWING ABUSE OF POWER BY GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR STRUGGLES WITH ONE ANOTHER HAS LED TO THEIR DEMANDING SUCH MATERIAL AND EVEN MORAL SACRIFICES FROM THEIR SUBJECTS THAT EVERYONE IS FORCED TO REFLECT AND ASK HIMSELF CAN I MAKE THESE SACRIFICES
IN REALITY ALL THE ACTS WHICH SEEM TO BE HIS ARE THE WORK OF A HIGHER POWER AND HE IS NOT THE CREATOR OF HIS OWN LIFE BUT THE SLAVE OF IT
VERY OFTEN NOW IT IS NOT THE OPPRESSED WHO STRIVE TO ATTAIN THE POSITION OF THE OPPRESSORS AND TRY TO IMITATE THEM BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE OPPRESSORS WHO VOLUNTARILY ABANDON THE ADVANTAGES OF THEIR POSITION PREFER THE CONDITION OF THE OPPRESSED AND TRY TO RESEMBLE THEM IN THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR LIFE
THE SECOND SOMEWHAT LESS GROSS FORM OF ARGUMENT CONSISTS IN DECLARING THAT THOUGH CHRIST DID INDEED PREACH THAT WE SHOULD TURN THE LEFT CHEEK AND GIVE THE CLOAK ALSO AND THIS IS THE HIGHEST MORAL DUTY YET THAT THERE ARE WICKED MEN IN THE WORLD AND IF THESE WICKED MEN MERE NOT RESTRAINED BY FORCE THE WHOLE WORLD AND ALL GOOD MEN WOULD COME TO RUIN THROUGH THEM
SO THEY TREATED THE MESSIAH WHOSE EXAMPLE WE ARE HUMBLY STRIVING TO IMITATE
I SHALL STILL PROFESS CHRISTIANITY AND SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT MY COVENANT WITH CHRIST AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT
LOVE WAS A NECESSITY AND WAS CONFINED TO CERTAIN OBJECTS--SELF FAMILY SOCIETY
TO GET RID OF GOVERNMENTAL VIOLENCE IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH ALL ARE NOT TRUE CHRISTIANS WILL ONLY RESULT IN THE WICKED DOMINATING THE GOOD AND OPPRESSING THEM WITH IMPUNITY SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS
YET ONE WOULD THINK IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT IF MEN WHO CONSIDER IT UNJUST AND ALL THE WORKING CLASSES DO CONSIDER IT SO NOWADAYS STILL PAY THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE PRODUCE OF THEIR LABOR AWAY TO THE CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNER AND PAY TAXES THOUGH THEY KNOW TO WHAT A BAD USE THESE TAXES ARE PUT THEY DO SO NOT FROM RECOGNITION OF ABSTRACT LAWS OF WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE BEATEN AND KILLED IF THEY DON'T DO SO
BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CIVIL WAR PUBLIC OPINION WAS AGITATED ON THIS SUBJECT
TWO HAVE ALREADY BEEN PASSED THROUGH BY HUMANITY AND THE THIRD IS THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH NOW IN CHRISTIANITY
THE ROMAN TOO MIGHT WELL OBEY THE LAWS WHICH HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN DICTATED BY THE NYMPH EGERIA
IF THE IMMENSE WEALTH PRODUCED BY THE LABOR OF THE WORKING CLASSES IS NOT REGARDED AS THE PROPERTY OF ALL BUT AS THE PROPERTY OF A FEW EXCEPTIONAL PERSONS
DOES THE GOVERNMENT LET THEM OFF THEN
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER-GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING WAS TRANSMITTED TO MEN NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER TRUTH BUT IN A SPECIAL MIRACULOUS WAY
THE ARMY IS ONLY CALLED OUT AGAINST THE MOB WHEN THE PEOPLE IN IGNORANCE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS MAKE DISTURBANCES AND DESTROY THE TRANQUILLITY NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE
UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHIES AND REPUBLICS AS IN FRANCE AND AMERICA AUTHORITY IS DIVIDED AMONG A GREAT NUMBER OF OPPRESSORS AND THE FORMS ASSUMED BY VIOLENCE IS LESS CRUDE BUT ITS EFFECT OF MAKING THE DISADVANTAGES OF AUTHORITY GREATER THAN ITS ADVANTAGES AND OF ENFEEBLING THE OPPRESSED TO THE FURTHEST EXTREME TO WHICH THEY CAN BE REDUCED WITH ADVANTAGE TO THE OPPRESSORS REMAINS ALWAYS THE SAME
WHAT ABOUT THE LAW THEN WHICH DEFINES OUR WHOLE EXISTENCE
THIS PROBABLY MEANS THAT FRANCE CANNOT DISBAND ITS ARMY BEFORE TAKING ITS REVENGE PUBLIC OPINION IS NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT THEM AND MOREOVER THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLES ARE NOT SUCH AS TO MAKE THEIR ACCEPTANCE POSSIBLE
THE COURTIERS COME TO LOOK AT THE TAILORS WORK AND SEE NOTHING FOR THE MEN ARE PLYING THEIR NEEDLES IN EMPTY SPACE
ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE IN WHICH HE CAN MERGE HIS LIFE IN THE LIFE OF THE FATHER
THUS THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED AFTER MY BOOK CAME OUT WENT TO SHOW THAT THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IN ITS DIRECT AND SIMPLE SENSE WAS UNDERSTOOD AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY A MINORITY OF MEN WHILE THE CRITICS ECCLESIASTICAL AND FREETHINKING ALIKE DENIED THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING CHRIST'S TEACHING IN ITS DIRECT SENSE
JUST AS NO POWER IN THE WORLD CAN PUT THEM BACK INTO THE SHELLS SO CAN NO POWER IN THE WORLD BRING MEN AGAIN UNDER THE GOVERNMENTAL TYPE OF SOCIETY WHEN ONCE THEY HAVE OUTGROWN IT
THE CHURCH IS THE SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL ESTABLISHED BY OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE EARTH AND SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF ITS LAWFUL PASTORS AND CHIEF OF THEM OUR HOLY FATHER THE POPE THE GREEK ORTHODOX CATECHISM SAYS
THE BEST MEN OF OUR DAY ARE ALL STRIVING FOR SUCH PLACES OF HONOR
I KNOW THAT IN THE CASE OF ONE MAN WHO DECLINED TO SERVE IN 1884 IN MOSCOW THE OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE ON THE SUBJECT HAD TWO MONTHS AFTER HIS REFUSAL ACCUMULATED INTO A BIG FOLIO AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY SECRET AMONG THE MINISTRY
AND THE YOUNG MAN IS CONDUCTED UNDER ESCORT TO THE PRIESTS THAT THEY MAY BRING HIM TO REASON
TO CARRY OUT AN ORDER RECEIVED FROM A SUPERIOR OFFICER EXACTLY WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR NOT AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO CARRY IT OUT
BUT THE CHURCH IS HOLY
ARE YE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THEY
THE STATE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE BASED ON VIOLENCE THE AIM OF WHICH WAS THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL FAMILY AND SOCIAL WELFARE HAS COME TO THE POINT OF RENOUNCING THE VERY OBJECTS FOR WHICH IT WAS FOUNDED--IT HAS REDUCED MEN TO ABSOLUTE RENUNCIATION AND LOSS OF THE WELFARE IT WAS TO SECURE
CHRISTIANITY IN HELCHITSKY'S VIEW STILL PRESERVES THESE ELEMENTS AND IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR SOCIETY TO RETURN TO ITS PURE DOCTRINE TO RENDER UNNECESSARY EVERY OTHER FORM OF SOCIAL ORDER IN WHICH KINGS AND POPES ARE ESSENTIAL
IF MEN CEASE TO FIGHT DUELS AND THE TCHERKESSES CEASE TO BE ROBBERS IT WILL NOT BE FROM FEAR OF PUNISHMENT INDEED THAT INVESTS THE CRIME WITH ADDITIONAL CHARM FOR YOUTH BUT THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE MORAL STANDARD OF PUBLIC OPINION
THE LANDOWNER MADE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WOMEN FOR THUS TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
IF WE MUST BE AFRAID LET US BE AFRAID OF WHAT IS REALLY ALARMING AND NOT WHAT WE IMAGINE AS ALARMING
BUT QUITE CONSISTENT WITH THE VERY OPPOSITE QUALITIES--PRIDE CUNNING CRUELTY
IT CAN ONLY BE FREELY ASSIMILATED
ALL THE CONSCRIPTS REPEAT THESE FEROCIOUS WORDS WITHOUT THINKING
THE BOOK I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF TRANSLATING IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION OF THE MODERN WORLD WHICH HAS APPEARED IN EUROPE FOR MANY YEARS AND ITS INFLUENCE IS SURE TO BE LASTING AND FAR REACHING
JUST AS THIS ROBBER AND MURDERER COULD NOT DENY WHAT WAS EVIDENT TO EVERYONE SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT A MAN LIVING UPON THE PRIVATIONS OF THE OPPRESSED CLASSES CANNOT PERSUADE HIMSELF AND OTHERS THAT HE DESIRES THE WELFARE OF THOSE HE PLUNDERS AND THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW THE ADVANTAGES HE ENJOYS ARE OBTAINED
AS TO THE TIME AND MANNER OF SALVATION OPINIONS ARE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE PREJUDICES OF EACH SOCIETY
WELL THIS SIMPLETON'S ADVICE WOULD NEVER BE FOLLOWED BY MEN OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHO CONTINUE TO FLOG ONE ANOTHER AND TEACH PEOPLE THAT THIS VERY ACT OF SELF-CASTIGATION IS THE LAST WORD OF HUMAN WISDOM
HE FEELS THAT HIS POSITION IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNENDURABLE AND REACHING A CRISIS OF INTENSITY
ALL THAT IS SAID ONLY BY THOSE WHO PROFIT BY THIS ORGANIZATION WHILE THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM IT--AND THEY ARE TEN TIMES AS NUMEROUS--THINK AND SAY QUITE THE CONTRARY
AND IF THEY HAVE HAD RECOURSE TO VIOLENCE ON THEIR SIDE THEY ARE CONDEMNED TO BE HANGED
I HAVE TRIED TO BRING TOGETHER IN THIS CONNECTION ALL I COULD NOT ONLY FROM THE CRITICISMS ON MY BOOK BUT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN PAST TIMES ON THIS THEME
AS THE CUSTOM IS EVERY YEAR IN ALL THE VILLAGES AND HAMLETS OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF RUSSIANS ON THE 1ST OF NOVEMBER THE VILLAGE ELDERS HAD ASSEMBLED THE YOUNG MEN INSCRIBED ON THE LISTS OFTEN THEIR OWN SONS AMONG THEM AND HAD BROUGHT THEM TO THE TOWN
AND INDEED WHAT IS A HERESY
AND IS NOT THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO HERESY IN THE EARLIEST DAYS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CHRISTIANS DID NOT JUDGE ONE ANOTHER BY VERBAL EXPRESSIONS BUT BY DEED AND BY HEART SINCE THEY HAD PERFECT LIBERTY TO EXPRESS THEIR IDEAS WITHOUT THE DREAD OF BEING CALLED HERETICS
THE HOLY ALLIANCE WAS NOTHING BUT THAT THE LEAGUE OF PEACE WAS ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT THE SAME THING AND SO ON
EVEN APART FROM THE MORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF COMPLIANCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE CONSIDERING MATERIAL ADVANTAGE ONLY NON-COMPLIANCE WILL BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS IN GENERAL
THE ARCHBISHOPS KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS WE DO I SHOULD HOPE A RUSSIAN SOLDIER ONCE OBSERVED TO ME
NO WAR TO BE DECLARED
THE PATRIARCHAL RELIGIONS EXALTED THE FAMILY THE TRIBE THE NATION
AND SO IT HAS GROWN AND NOW HAS REACHED ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT NOT YET IN ACTUAL LIFE BUT IN THE CONSCIENCE OF MEN OF TO-DAY
WE MAY REPLACE IT BY ANOTHER AND BETTER BY FINDING A CRITERION BY WHICH EVIL COULD BE DEFINED FOR ALL MEN UNANIMOUSLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY
BUT THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OF NO USE TO ANYONE FOR A LONG TIME PAST THE CONDITION OF CHRISTIAN HUMANITY WITH ITS FORTRESSES CANNONS DYNAMITE GUNS TORPEDOES PRISONS GALLOWS CHURCHES FACTORIES CUSTOMS OFFICES AND PALACES IS REALLY TERRIBLE
THEN WE ESTABLISH OUR MORALS AMONG THEM TEACH THEM THE USE OF VIOLENCE AND NEW METHODS OF DESTRUCTION I E WE TEACH THEM NOTHING BUT THE ANIMAL LAW OF STRIFE BELOW WHICH MAN CANNOT SINK AND WE DO ALL WE CAN TO CONCEAL FROM THEM ALL THAT IS CHRISTIAN IN US
THE RECOGNITION OR NON-RECOGNITION OF A CERTAIN TRUTH DEPENDS NOT ON EXTERNAL CAUSES BUT ON CERTAIN OTHER CAUSES WITHIN THE MAN HIMSELF
SUDDENLY THE MOST DIFFERENT PEOPLE--MECHANICS PROFESSORS TRADESMEN PEASANTS SERVANTS AS THOUGH BY AGREEMENT REFUSE TO FILL THIS OFFICE AND NOT ON THE GROUNDS ALLOWED AS SUFFICIENT BY LAW BUT BECAUSE ANY PROCESS AT LAW IS ACCORDING TO THEIR VIEWS UNCHRISTIAN
HE CANNOT BE COMPELLED TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE DEPRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS WHICH FORM SUCH A POWERFUL WEAPON AGAINST MEN OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAVE NOT THE LEAST POWER TO COMPEL HIM
THE CONGRESS RESOLVES THAT A COMMITTEE BE APPOINTED TO ADDRESS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE PRINCIPAL POLITICAL RELIGIOUS COMMERCIAL AND LABOR AND PEACE ORGANIZATIONS REQUESTING THEM TO SEND PETITIONS TO THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES PRAYING THAT MEASURES BE TAKEN FOR THE FORMATION OF SUITABLE TRIBUNALS FOR THE ADJUDICATURE OF INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS SO AS TO AVOID THE RESORT TO WAR
TO SAY THAT GNOSTICISM OR EBIONITISM ARE LEGITIMATE FORMS OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT ONE MUST BOLDLY DENY THE EXISTENCE OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT AT ALL OR ANY SPECIFIC CHARACTER BY WHICH IT COULD BE RECOGNIZED
IN THE VENERATION OF HOLY RELICS AND OF IKONS THE OFFERING OF SACRIFICES TO THEM AND THE EXPECTATION OF THEIR ANSWERS TO PRAYER
AT THE PLEA OF THE HUMAN RACE CIVILIZATION ARRAIGNS WARFARE AND DRAWS UP THE GREAT LIST OF CRIMES LAID AT THE CHARGE OF CONQUERORS AND GENERALS
AND THIS HAPPENED FIRST IN THE EARLIEST TIMES WHEN THE DOCTRINE WAS STILL NOT SO FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND OFTEN INTERPRETED WRONGLY AS WE SEE BY THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS
EVERY SOLDIER EVEN THE KNIGHT IS ONLY A VIOLENT EVIL DOER--A MURDERER THE SAME ACCOUNT IS GIVEN BY THE GERMAN BOOK WITH THE ADDITION OF A FEW BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS AND SOME EXTRACTS FROM HELCHITSKY'S WRITINGS
AND SO THAT WAS WHY THE GOVERNOR OF TOULA WAS GOING IN HIS TURN WITH HIS SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS TO CARRY OUT A SIMILAR MEASURE
SOME WERE SMOKING NUDGING EACH OTHER JOKING GRINNING AND LAUGHING OTHERS WERE MUNCHING SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND SPITTING OUT THE HUSKS WITH AN AIR OF DIGNITY
TOLSTOI'S GENIUS IS BEYOND DISPUTE
JESUS CHRIST IS MY LORD AND TEACHER SAYS BALLOU IN ONE OF HIS ESSAYS EXPOSING THE INCONSISTENCY OF CHRISTIANS WHO ALLOWED A RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE AND OF WARFARE
AND BESIDES THEY TOO LIKE THE GOVERNOR ARE DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE SOLDIERS OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS CAN BE RECKONED ON
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS BUT I LIVE ON A SALARY PAID ME FOR PROSECUTING JUDGING AND CONDEMNING THE THIEF OR THE PROSTITUTE WHOSE EXISTENCE THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY LIFE TENDS TO BRING ABOUT AND WHO I KNOW OUGHT NOT TO BE PUNISHED BUT REFORMED
IN SPITE OF ALL THE EXTERNAL VARNISH OF MODERNITY LEARNING AND SPIRITUALITY WHICH THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH BEGIN NOWADAYS TO ASSUME IN THEIR WORKS THEIR ARTICLES THEIR THEOLOGICAL JOURNALS AND THEIR SERMONS THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH CONSISTS OF NOTHING MORE THAN KEEPING THE PEOPLE IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION OF COARSE AND SAVAGE IDOLATRY AND WORSE STILL STRENGTHENING AND DIFFUSING SUPERSTITION AND RELIGIOUS IGNORANCE AND SUPPRESSING THAT LIVING UNDERSTANDING OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH EXISTS IN THE PEOPLE SIDE BY SIDE WITH IDOLATRY
THE VICTIM'S BACK AND THIGHS AND LEGS AND EVEN HIS SIDES BECAME MORE AND MORE COVERED WITH SCARS AND WHEALS AND AT EVERY BLOW THERE CAME THE SOUND OF THE DEEP GROANS WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN
WE ARE HELD FAST IN THE TOILS OF OFFICIALDOM AND RED TAPE AND TOO RUDE A SHOCK WOULD BE NEEDED TO SET US FREE
IT WOULD SEEM OBVIOUS THAT IF THIS MAN PROFESSES ANY CHRISTIAN OR LIBERAL PRINCIPLES HE MUST FIRST OF ALL GIVE UP RUINING HUMAN LIVES FOR HIS OWN PROFIT
V
V
V
V
GERMANY FIRST HIT ON THIS DEVICE
LIFE ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S TEACHING CONSISTS OF NOTHING BUT THIS SETTING FREE OF THE SON OF GOD EXISTING IN EVERY MAN FROM THE ANIMAL AND IN BRINGING HIM CLOSER TO THE FATHER
THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN SLAVERY AND CONDEMNED TO PRIVATION AND DARKNESS TO MINISTER TO THE LUSTS OF THE MINORITY WHO KEEP THEM DOWN
NO ONE HAS AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO GOVERN OTHERS
17
17
FEAR WILL COME UPON US--A VOID A VAST EMPTINESS FREEDOM--HOW ARE WE TO GO FORWARD NOT KNOWING WHITHER HOW FACE LOSS NOT SEEING HOPE OF GAIN
IN MANY RESPECTS ESPECIALLY IN THE OPPRESSION OF THE MASSES IT HAS BECOME EVEN MORE CRUEL THAN IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF PAGANISM
YET YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ANYTHING LIKE A DEFINITION OF HERESY
THEY HANG THEY FLOG TO DEATH WOMEN OLD MEN AND INNOCENT PEOPLE AS WAS DONE RECENTLY AMONG US IN RUSSIA AT THE YUZOVSKY FACTORY AND IS ALWAYS BEING DONE EVERYWHERE IN EUROPE AND AMERICA IN THE STRUGGLE WITH THE ANARCHISTS AND ALL OTHER REBELS AGAINST THE EXISTING ORDER
28
THE PRESS OF ALL COUNTRIES IS CONTINUALLY EXPRESSING THE UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR PEACE AND THE GENERAL SENSE OF ITS NECESSITY FOR ALL NATIONS
AND THE LONGER MEN USED VIOLENCE AS THE MEANS OF SETTLING THEIR DISPUTES THE MORE OBVIOUS IT BECAME THAT IT WAS AN UNSUITABLE MEANS SINCE THERE COULD BE NO EXTERNAL AUTHORITY ABLE TO DEFINE EVIL RECOGNIZED BY ALL
REDUCING IT TO ITS DOGMATIC SIDE ONLY--TO THE DOCTRINES OF THE TRINITY THE REDEMPTION THE MIRACLES THE CHURCH THE SACRAMENTS AND SO ON--MEN OF SCIENCE REGARD IT AS ONLY ONE OF AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE ARISEN AMONG MANKIND AND NOW THEY SAY HAVING PLAYED OUT ITS PART IN HISTORY IT IS OUTLIVING ITS OWN AGE AND FADING AWAY BEFORE THE LIGHT OF SCIENCE AND OF TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT
IF IT IS FOR GOOD DEEDS HE SAYS HE WILL GIVE IT OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND MORE EVEN THAN IS REQUIRED OF HIM
AND AT THIS VERY TIME SOME MEN OF THIS KIND ARE IN PRISON NOT CHARGED WITH THEIR REAL OFFENSE--THAT IS DENYING THE LAWFULNESS OF THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT FOR NON-FULFILLMENT OF SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT
AND THEREFORE EVEN IF MAN IS NOT FREE AS REGARDS PERFORMING THESE OR THOSE ACTS BECAUSE THERE EXISTS A PREVIOUS CAUSE FOR EVERY ACT THE VERY CAUSES OF HIS ACTS CONSISTING AS THEY DO FOR THE MAN OF CONSCIENCE OF THE RECOGNITION OF THIS OR THAT TRUTH ARE WITHIN HIS OWN CONTROL
THE TURKS HAVE DOMINATED AND STILL DOMINATE THE SLAVONIANS AND GREEKS
BUT THE PEOPLE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PREJUDICES INSTILLED INTO THEM BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHURCH HAVE IN THEIR BEST REPRESENTATIVES LONG OUTGROWN THAT CRUDE STAGE OF UNDERSTANDING A FACT WHICH IS PROVED BY THE SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERE OF THE RATIONALIST SECTS WITH WHICH RUSSIA IS SWARMING TO-DAY AND ON WHICH CHURCHMEN ARE NOW CARRYING ON AN INEFFECTUAL WARFARE
THIS IS A FATAL ERROR BECAUSE IT LEADS MEN TO NEGLECT THE CHIEF FORCE UNDERLYING THEIR LIFE--THEIR SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY--AND TO TURN ALL THEIR ATTENTION AND ENERGY TO THE USE OF VIOLENCE WHICH IS SUPERFICIAL SLUGGISH AND MOST GENERALLY PERNICIOUS IN ITS ACTION
BUT WITH SUCH A DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH THERE IS STILL MORE DIFFICULTY IN RECONCILING AS HOMYAKOV TRIES TO DO THE CHURCH UNITED BY LOVE WITH THE CHURCH THAT RECOGNIZES THE NICENE CREED AND THE DOCTRINE OF PHOTIUS
IT IS TRUE THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY REMAINS IN ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES JUST AS MUCH AN ORGANIZATION BASED ON VIOLENCE AS IT WAS ONE THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND EVEN IN SOME RESPECTS ESPECIALLY IN THE PREPARATION FOR WAR AND IN WAR ITSELF IT APPEARS STILL MORE BRUTAL
TO INJURE ANOTHER BECAUSE HE HAS INJURED US EVEN WITH THE AIM OF OVERCOMING EVIL IS DOUBLING THE HARM FOR HIM AND FOR ONESELF
AND EVEN THIS IS NOW--THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF COMMUNISTS AND SOCIALISTS--BEING GRADUALLY ENCROACHED UPON BY GOVERNMENT SO THAT LABOR AND RECREATION DWELLINGS DRESS AND FOOD WILL GRADUALLY IF THE HOPES OF THE REFORMERS ARE SUCCESSFUL BE PRESCRIBED AND REGULATED BY GOVERNMENT
THE LATTER LIKE ALL SLAVES ALWAYS FIND A JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR OWN SERVILITY IN ASCRIBING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE TO THOSE THEY SERVE
AND EVEN THREE CENTURIES AGO THE MEN WHO DESCRIBED AN IMAGINARY SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE UTOPIA COULD NOT CONCEIVE OF IT WITHOUT SLAVES
IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A STATE RELIGION THEY TEACH THE CHILDREN THE SENSELESS BLASPHEMIES OF THE CHURCH CATECHISMS TOGETHER WITH THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE TO THEIR SUPERIORS
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE MEN OF THE LOWER ORDERS WHO GAIN NO KIND OF ADVANTAGE FROM THE EXISTING REGIME BUT ON THE CONTRARY ARE TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT SUPPORT IT EVEN BY DRAGGING PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN HANDS FROM THEIR FAMILIES HANDCUFFING THEM THROWING THEM IN PRISON GUARDING THEM SHOOTING THEM
AND THE ARTIST CERTAINLY DOES NOT ARGUE THAT HE NEEDS THE CAPITALISTS AND THE TROOPS TO DEFEND THEM SO THAT THEY MAY BUY HIS PICTURES
WHEREFORE IF GOD SO CLOTHE THE GRASS OF THE FIELD WHICH TO-DAY IS AND TO-MORROW IS CAST INTO THE OVEN SHALL HE NOT MUCH MORE CLOTHE YOU O YE OF LITTLE FAITH
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN A WICKED AND SENSELESS GOD--WHO HAS CURSED THE HUMAN RACE AND DEVOTED HIS OWN SON TO SACRIFICE AND A PART OF MANKIND TO ETERNAL TORMENT--CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE GOD OF LOVE
BY FALSE RELIGION AND BY FALSE SCIENCE
THE ONLY DEFINITION OF HERESY THE WORD GREEK WORD MEANS A PART IS THIS
THE CONVICTS SPIT INTO THEIR HANDS BRANDISHED THE RODS AND BEGAN TO FLOG
AND HERE THE ADVOCATES OF POSITIVIST COMMUNISTIC SOCIALISTIC FRATERNITY PROPOSE TO DRAW UPON CHRISTIAN LOVE TO MAKE UP THE DEFAULT OF THIS BANKRUPT HUMAN LOVE
HE SHALL NOT STRIVE NOR CRY
THE HISTORY OF MANKIND IS CROWDED WITH EVIDENCES PROVING THAT PHYSICAL COERCION IS NOT ADAPTED TO MORAL REGENERATION AND THAT THE SINFUL DISPOSITIONS OF MEN CAN BE SUBDUED ONLY BY LOVE
IT FOLLOWS THAT WE CANNOT SUE ANY MAN AT LAW TO FORCE HIM TO RETURN ANYTHING HE MAY HAVE WRONGLY TAKEN FROM US
BUT NOTHING OF THIS KIND IS DONE
CHARLES V JOHN IV ALEXANDER I RECOGNIZING THE EMPTINESS AND THE EVIL OF POWER RENOUNCED IT BECAUSE THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF USING VIOLENCE FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT AS THEY HAD DONE
WE MUST NOT GIVE UP FORCE BY WHICH THE EXISTING ORDER IS MAINTAINED AND BY RELYING ON THE VAGUE AND IMPALPABLE INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION EXPOSE CHRISTIANS TO THE RISK OF BEING PILLAGED MURDERED AND OUTRAGED IN EVERY WAY BY THE SAVAGES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY
IT IS ONLY DUE TO THE INTENSE ZEAL OF THE CHURCHES IN THIS DIRECTION THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCHES HAS LASTED HITHERTO
ONE ASKS ONESELF HOW CAN PEOPLE WHO PRIZE THEIR SECURITY QUIETLY ALLOW IT AND PUT UP WITH IT
AND THE LANDOWNER WHO STARTED THE AFFAIR AND THE JUDGE WHO PRONOUNCED A CLEARLY UNJUST EVEN THOUGH FORMALLY LEGAL DECISION AND THOSE WHO COMMANDED THE EXECUTION OF THE DECISION AND THOSE WHO LIKE THE POLICEMEN SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WILL EXECUTE THE DEED WITH THEIR OWN HANDS FLOGGING AND KILLING THEIR BROTHERS ALL WHO HAVE DEVISED ABETTED DECREED EXECUTED OR ALLOWED SUCH CRIMES WILL MAKE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME REPLY
THE LARGER AND STRONGER GROUPS CONQUERED AND ABSORBED THE WEAKER AND THE LARGER AND STRONGER THEY BECAME THE MORE INTERNAL FEUDS DISAPPEARED AND THE MORE THE CONTINUITY OF THE GROUP SEEMED ASSURED
IF THERE ARE ALREADY SOLDIERS WHO REALIZE ALL THE SIN AND HARM OF WAR AND ARE NOT WILLING TO FIRE ON MEN EITHER OF THEIR OWN OR A FOREIGN COUNTRY
ONE IS SMOKING A CIGARETTE
ALL THAT IS HUMBUG OR ELSE SIMPLY ANXIETY TO KEEP THE SLAVE FIT TO DO HIS WORK
THAT JESUS IS ALSO GOD THE SON WHO CREATED ALL BEFORE TIME WAS
THIS IS WHAT TOOK PLACE IN OREL
CERTAINLY NOT
BUT THAT IS JUST THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND HEATHEN RELIGION
HAVING LEARNT THE DRIFT OF HELCHITSKY'S TEACHING IN THIS WAY I AWAITED ALL THE MORE IMPATIENTLY THE APPEARANCE OF THE NET OF FAITH IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY
AND INDEED HOW COULD NATIONS BE SUBJUGATED BY VIOLENCE WHO ARE LED BY THEIR WHOLE EDUCATION THEIR TRADITIONS AND EVEN THEIR RELIGION TO SEE THE LOFTIEST VIRTUE IN WARRING WITH THEIR OPPRESSORS AND FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM
AND THE ADVANCED GUARD CANNOT CEASE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY HAVE ONCE UNDERSTOOD
THE MEN TRAVELING IN THE TOULA TRAIN WERE GOING WITH THE OBJECT OF KILLING AND INJURING THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES BUT NONE COULD TELL WHETHER THEY WOULD CARRY OUT THEIR OBJECT OR NOT
BUT WE DO KNOW BY PROLONGED EXPERIENCE THAT NEITHER ENEMIES NOR CRIMINALS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SUPPRESSED BY FORCE
ONE THING ONLY HAS CHANGED-THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT
ANOTHER MISUNDERSTANDING ARISING FROM THE SAME SOURCE CONSISTS IN SUBSTITUTING LOVE FOR MEN THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY FOR THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES OF LOVE FOR GOD AND HIS SERVICE
THE DIFFERENCE AS REGARDS THIS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MAN AND HUMANITY AS A WHOLE LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN FORMING THE VIEW OF LIFE PROPER TO THE NEW PERIOD OF LIFE ON WHICH HE IS ENTERING AND THE CONDUCT RESULTING FROM IT BENEFITS BY THE EXPERIENCE OF MEN WHO HAVE LIVED BEFORE HIM WHO HAVE ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THE STAGE OF GROWTH UPON WHICH HE IS ENTERING
IN THIS STRUGGLE THE MOST CRUEL THE COARSEST THE LEAST CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY OVERPOWER THE MOST GENTLE WELL-DISPOSED AND CHRISTIAN AND RISE BY MEANS OF THEIR VIOLENCE TO THE UPPER RANKS OF SOCIETY
SO IT WAS UNDER THE ROMAN AND BYZANTINE EMPERORS AND SO IT CONTINUED TO BE LATER
HE CAN DO NOTHING OF THAT KIND IF HE WISHES TO BE FAITHFUL TO CHRIST'S LAW
AND IN A BROKEN VOICE HARDLY ABOVE A WHISPER HE SAYS
IF FOR EVIL DEEDS THEN HE WILL GIVE NOTHING VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE BY THE LAW OF CHRIST WHOSE FOLLOWER HE IS HE CANNOT TAKE PART IN EVIL DEEDS THE OTHERS TOO SAY THE SAME IN OTHER WORDS AND WILL NOT VOLUNTARILY PAY THE TAXES
CAIN OVERPOWERED ABEL THE CUNNING JACOB OPPRESSED THE GUILELESS ESAU AND WAS IN HIS TURN DECEIVED BY LABAN CAIAPHAS AND PILATE OPPRESSED CHRIST THE ROMAN EMPERORS OPPRESSED SENECA EPICTETUS AND THE GOOD ROMANS WHO LIVED IN THEIR TIMES
YOU WHO MAY DIE ANY INSTANT YOU SIGN SENTENCES OF DEATH YOU DECLARE WAR YOU TAKE PART IN IT YOU JUDGE YOU PUNISH YOU PLUNDER THE WORKING PEOPLE YOU LIVE LUXURIOUSLY IN THE MIDST OF THE POOR AND TEACH WEAK MEN WHO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU THAT THIS MUST BE SO THAT THE DUTY OF MEN IS TO DO THIS AND YET IT MAY HAPPEN AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU ARE ACTING THUS THAT A BACTERIUM OR A BULL MAY ATTACK YOU AND YOU WILL FALL AND DIE LOSING FOREVER THE CHANCE OF REPAIRING THE HARM YOU HAVE DONE TO OTHERS AND ABOVE ALL TO YOURSELF IN USELESSLY WASTING A LIFE WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN YOU ONLY ONCE IN ETERNITY WITHOUT HAVING ACCOMPLISHED THE ONLY THING YOU OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
AND THEN THE CHURCH COMES FORWARD NOT BORROWING FROM THE PEOPLE BUT ZEALOUSLY INSTILLING INTO THEM THE PETRIFIED FORMALITIES OF AN EXTINCT PAGANISM AND STRIVING TO THRUST THEM BACK AGAIN INTO THE DARKNESS FROM WHICH THEY ARE EMERGING WITH SUCH EFFORT
INTIMIDATION BRIBERY HYPNOTISM AND COERCION BY FORCE OF ARMS--STATE VIOLENCE CAN NEVER BE SUPPRESSED BY THE FORCIBLE OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT--MEN ARE LED BY THE SUFFERINGS OF THE PAGAN MODE OF LIFE TO THE NECESSITY OF ACCEPTING CHRIST'S TEACHING WITH ITS DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE BY FORCE--THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS TRUTH WHICH IS DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY WILL ALSO BRING ABOUT ITS ACCEPTANCE--THIS CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN COMPLETE CONTRADICTION WITH OUR LIFE--THIS IS SPECIALLY OBVIOUS IN COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE BUT THROUGH HABIT AND THE APPLICATION OF THE FOUR METHODS OF VIOLENCE BY THE STATE MEN DO NOT SEE THIS INCONSISTENCY OF CHRISTIANITY WITH LIFE OF A SOLDIER--THEY DO NOT EVEN SEE IT THOUGH THE AUTHORITIES THEMSELVES SHOW ALL THE IMMORALITY OF A SOLDIER'S DUTIES WITH PERFECT CLEARNESS--THE CALL TO MILITARY SERVICE IS THE SUPREME TEST FOR EVERY MAN WHEN THE CHOICE IS OFFERED HIM BETWEEN ADOPTING THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE OR SLAVISHLY SUBMITTING TO
BUT HOW CAN MEN BE UNITED IN THE TRUTH OR EVEN APPROXIMATE TO IT IF THEY DO NOT EVEN EXPRESS THE TRUTH THEY KNOW BUT HOLD THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO DO SO AND PRETEND TO REGARD AS TRUTH WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE FALSE
AND WHY MOST OF ALL SHOULD I TAKE PART IN PERSON OR HIRE OTHERS TO MURDER MY OWN BROTHERS AND KINSMEN
THAT IS THE LIFE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MAN AND THAT IS THE LIFE OF HUMAN SOCIETIES AND OF HUMANITY
ENTRONS AU PALAIS DE LA GUERRE THERE IS THE LAW OF EVOLUTION AND THEREFORE THERE IS NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL AND ONE MUST LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF ONE'S PERSONAL EXISTENCE LEAVING THE REST TO THE ACTION OF THE LAW OF EVOLUTION
ANOTHER AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF NOBILITY
BUT WHO IS TO ARRANGE THAT NO WAR IS TO BE DECLARED
FOR HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT AT ANY TIME WILL BE REQUIRED OF HIM BY THAT CHRISTIAN LAW OF LOVE OBEDIENCE TO WHICH CONSTITUTES THE MEANING OF LIFE FOR HIM
HE SAW THE WORLD REDEEMING ITSELF FROM HEREDITARY DEGENERATIONS BY SACRIFICE
TERTULLIAN ORIGEN AUGUSTINE LUTHER HUSS SAVONAROLA HELCHITSKY AND THE REST WERE HERETICS
WE CANNOT PERSUADE OURSELVES AND OTHERS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT MEN DO NOT LIKE DYING OF HUNGER BEREFT OF THE RIGHT TO GAIN THEIR SUBSISTENCE FROM THE EARTH ON WHICH THEY LIVE
THE CONGRESS HOLDS THAT THE DOCTRINE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN REQUIRES THAT THE ABORIGINAL AND WEAKER RACES THEIR TERRITORIES AND LIBERTIES SHALL BE GUARDED FROM INJUSTICE AND FRAUD AND THAT THESE RACES SHALL BE SHIELDED AGAINST THE VICES SO PREVALENT AMONG THE SO-CALLED ADVANCED RACES OF MEN
THAT KILLING IN WAR AND EXECUTING CRIMINALS BY COMMAND OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL PROHIBITION OF MURDER
IT OUGHT ONLY TO BE DONE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO ARE GOVERNED
ALL AT ONCE ONE YOUNG MAN IN MOSCOW ANOTHER IN TVER A THIRD IN KHARKOV AND A FOURTH IN KIEV PRESENT THEMSELVES BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES AND AS THOUGH BY PREVIOUS AGREEMENT DECLARE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE OATH THEY WILL NOT SERVE BECAUSE THEY ARE CHRISTIANS
THE GENERAL HARMONY PREACHED BY THE UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS IS BUT A DREAM PERHAPS BUT AT LEAST IT IS THE FAIREST OF ALL DREAMS
D

REPLY EVADED BY MAKING BELIEVE THAT THE QUESTION HAS LONG BEEN DECIDED--TO DEVISE SUCH SUBTERFUGES AND TO TAKE REFUGE BEHIND THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH OF ANTIQUITY AND OF RELIGION IS ALL THAT ECCLESIASTICAL CRITICS CAN DO TO GET OUT OF THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN USE OF FORCE AND CHRISTIANITY IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE--GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WORLD AND OF THE AUTHORITIES TO PROFESSION OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY--GENERAL CHARACTER OF RUSSIAN FREETHINKING CRITICS--FOREIGN FREETHINKING CRITICS--MISTAKEN ARGUMENTS OF THESE CRITICS THE RESULT OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING
BUT UNLUCKILY THERE IS NO ONE TO GET HUMANITY'S NEW DWELLING READY FOR IT
SO THAT THE INFORMATION I HAVE GAINED OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE HIGHER RULING CLASSES NOT ONLY IN RUSSIA BUT IN EUROPE AND AMERICA TOWARD THE ELUCIDATION OF THIS QUESTION HAS CONVINCED ME THAT THERE EXISTS IN THESE RULING CLASSES A CONSCIOUSLY HOSTILE ATTITUDE TO TRUE CHRISTIANITY WHICH IS SHOWN PRE-EMINENTLY IN THEIR RETICENCE IN REGARD TO ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF IT
AT FIRST ONLY GRADUALLY AND SLOWLY ONE AFTER ANOTHER MEN ATTAIN TO THE NEW TRUTH BY THE INNER SPIRITUAL WAY AND FOLLOW IT OUT IN LIFE
YOU ARE UNDER AN INFLUENCE SO POWERFUL THAT YOU CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF
NEW BASIS OF CHURCH LIFE TREATING OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL IN PARTICULAR THE AUTHOR BEING UNDER NO NECESSITY LIKE THE CHURCHMEN TO HIDE ITS SIGNIFICANCE SAYS
PEACE IS A GIFT ONLY GRANTED TO THE STRONG AND THE RESOLUTE
THEY STILL GO LIKE SHEEP TO THE SLAUGHTER AND SUBMIT TO EVERYTHING REQUIRED OF THEM
DEAR BOY YOU MUST LOVE YOUR ENEMIES
HE ORDERED SOME LOADS OF RODS TO BE BROUGHT AND COLLECTING ALL THE PEASANTS TOGETHER INTO A BARN HE WENT IN WITH THEM LOCKING THE DOOR AFTER HIM
AND JUST AS IN A DREAM HIS POSITION BECOMING MORE AND MORE PAINFUL AT LAST REACHES SUCH A PITCH OF INTENSITY THAT HE BEGINS SOMETIMES TO DOUBT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS PASSING AND MAKES A MORAL EFFORT TO SHAKE OFF THE NIGHTMARE WHICH IS OPPRESSING HIM
AND IF IN THE WORST CASE SOME MEMBERS OF THE MINORITY WERE PERSECUTED TO DEATH IN DYING FOR THE TRUTH THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEM THEIR DOCTRINE SANCTIFIED BY THE BLOOD OF THEIR MARTYRDOM
DOUBTLESS IF THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD COULD SIMPLY TRANSFER THEMSELVES FROM ONE FURNISHED MANSION TO ANOTHER AND BETTER ONE--IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH EASIER
TO EXPRESS SATISFACTION AT THE OFFICIAL OVERTURES OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES ADDRESSED TO THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH CHURCH ORGANIZATION IN CHRISTENDOM TO UNITE IN A GENERAL CONFERENCE TO PROMOTE THE SUBSTITUTION OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION FOR WAR
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO-DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
E TO CARRY OUT THESE FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF CHRIST YOU EXPECT THEN THAT IN ANSWER TO THIS ESSENTIAL QUESTION WHICH IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD INDUCE A MAN TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE BOOK HE WILL SAY EITHER THAT THIS INTERPRETATION OF CHRIST'S TEACHING IS TRUE AND WE OUGHT TO FOLLOW IT OR HE WILL SAY THAT SUCH AN INTERPRETATION IS UNTRUE WILL SHOW WHY AND WILL GIVE SOME OTHER CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THOSE WORDS WHICH I INTERPRET INCORRECTLY
IF THIS IMPORTANT LIMITATION WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES THE WHOLE VALUE OF THE COMMANDMENT HAD ENTERED INTO CHRIST'S MEANING THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MENTION OF IT SOMEWHERE
IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE JUDGE READILY BELIEVES IN THE NECESSITY OF AN ORDER OF THINGS THROUGH WHICH HE RECEIVES A WAGE FIFTY TIMES AS GREAT AS THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS LABORER CAN EARN AND THE SAME APPLIES TO ALL THE HIGHER OFFICIALS
THE WHOLE EXISTENCE OF MODERN TIMES IS DEFINED BY LAWS
BUT WHY SHOULD WE KEEP AND MAINTAIN ALL THESE KINGS EMPERORS PRESIDENTS AND MEMBERS OF ALL SORTS OF SENATES AND MINISTRIES SINCE NOTHING COMES OF ALL THEIR DEBATES AND AUDIENCES
BUT WITH THE CLEAR CHRISTIAN DEFINITION OF GOOD AND EVIL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE IT
EVEN PROSTITUTION IS ENCOURAGED AND NOT ONLY RECOGNIZED BUT EVEN ORGANIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE MAJORITY OF STATES
I ONLY KNOW ONE WORK WHICH DIFFERS SOMEWHAT FROM THIS GENERAL DEFINITION AND THAT IS NOT A CRITICISM IN THE PRECISE MEANING OF THE WORD BUT AN ARTICLE TREATING OF THE SAME SUBJECT AND HAVING MY BOOK IN VIEW
FRANCE AND ONE MIGHT SAY EUROPE WILL BE RUINED BY SOLDIERS
AND THOSE OF THE LOWER CLASSES EXHAUSTED BY TOIL AND BRUTALIZED OF SET PURPOSE ARE KEPT IN A PERMANENT DECEPTION PRACTICED DELIBERATELY AND CONTINUOUSLY BY THE HIGHER CLASSES UPON THEM
LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL MEN IN THEIR PRIVATE LIFE LISTEN TO THEIR STANDARDS OF CONDUCT IN THEIR JUDGMENT OF ONE ANOTHER
THEY KNOW VERY WELL THAT ALL THESE DISCOURSES UPON PEACE WILL NOT HINDER THEM FROM SENDING MILLIONS OF MEN TO BUTCHERY WHEN IT SEEMS GOOD TO THEM
AND THIRDLY IN REALITY THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF THESE MEN FAR FROM EVER SACRIFICING THEIR OWN PLEASURE OR TRANQUILLITY TO SUPPORT THE STATE NEVER LET SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OF PROFITING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE IN EVERY WAY THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR OWN PLEASURE AND EASE
THIS TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THE LEADING THINKERS OF THE DAY IS NOWHERE MORE APPARENT THAN IN THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE PHENOMENON IN WHICH ALL THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS PRESENTED IN THE MOST CONCENTRATED FORM--IN THEIR ATTITUDE THAT IS TO WAR TO THE GENERAL ARMING OF NATIONS AND TO UNIVERSAL COMPULSORY SERVICE
29 IT IS ASSERTED THAT IN ORDER THAT THE UNSTABLE ORDER OF THINGS ESTABLISHED IN ONE CORNER OF THE WORLD FOR A FEW MEN MAY NOT BE DESTROYED YOU OUGHT TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH DESTROY THE ETERNAL AND IMMUTABLE ORDER ESTABLISHED BY GOD AND BY REASON
WE ARE STRUGGLING IN A CUL DE SAC WITH MUSKETS AIMED AT US FROM THE HOUSETOPS
THIS IDEA IS AN ABSOLUTELY MISTAKEN ONE
A SINGLE FORTUNE GAINED BY TRADING IN GOODS NECESSARY TO THE PEOPLE OR IN GOODS PERNICIOUS IN THEIR EFFECTS OR BY FINANCIAL SPECULATIONS OR BY ACQUIRING LAND AT A LOW PRICE THE VALUE OF WHICH IS INCREASED BY THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION OR BY AN INDUSTRY RUINOUS TO THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF THOSE EMPLOYED IN IT OR BY MILITARY OR CIVIL SERVICE OF THE STATE OR BY ANY EMPLOYMENT WHICH TRADES ON MEN'S EVIL INSTINCTS--A SINGLE FORTUNE ACQUIRED IN ANY OF THESE WAYS NOT ONLY WITH THE SANCTION BUT EVEN WITH THE APPROBATION OF THE LEADING MEN IN SOCIETY AND MASKED WITH AN OSTENTATION OF PHILANTHROPY CORRUPTS MEN INCOMPARABLY MORE THAN MILLIONS OF THEFTS AND ROBBERIES COMMITTED AGAINST THE RECOGNIZED FORMS OF LAW AND PUNISHABLE AS CRIMES
AND IF ANY MISCHIEF FOLLOW THEN THOU SHALT GIVE LIFE FOR LIFE EYE FOR EYE TOOTH FOR TOOTH HAND FOR HAND FOOT FOR FOOT BURNING FOR BURNING WOUND FOR WOUND STRIPE FOR STRIPE EX
BUT IF ANYONE WANTS TO TAKE PARTICULAR CARE OF HIS SOUL THEN ACCORDING TO THIS FAITH HE IS INSTRUCTED THAT THE GREATEST SECURITY OF THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL IN THE WORLD IS ATTAINED BY OFFERING MONEY TO THE CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES AND ENGAGING THE HOLY MEN BY THIS MEANS TO PRAY FOR HIM
I SEE THAT A MAN I KNOW TO BE A RUFFIAN IS PURSUING A YOUNG GIRL
THE SUFFERINGS OF THE WORKING CLASSES SPRINGING FROM THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN WHAT IS AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE ARE INCREASED TENFOLD BY THE ENVY AND HATRED ENGENDERED BY THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT
IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE ARMY
THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES HIS BOOK BY SAYING
THESE THREE CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE FORM THE FOUNDATION OF ALL THE RELIGIOUS THAT EXIST OR HAVE EXISTED
13 14-30 AND THERE COULD BE NO ANSWER BUT THIS ONE
IF THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT IS SUPPRESSED THE MORE WICKED WILL OPPRESS THE LESS WICKED SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF STATE AUTHORITY
THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE AUTHOR IS FELT IN EVERY LINE OF HIS WORK AND EVEN THE MOST PREJUDICED CANNOT RESIST THE FASCINATION OF HIS GENUINENESS SINCERITY AND PROFOUND EARNESTNESS
THERE IS NO ASPECT OF THE QUESTION EITHER ON HIS SIDE OR ON HIS OPPONENTS WHICH HE HAS NOT FOLLOWED UP IN HIS WRITINGS
AMONG THEM ARE OFTEN FREE-THINKING COMRADES--WHO HAVE ENLISTED VOLUNTARILY--OR YOUNG OFFICERS OF LIBERAL IDEAS AND ALREADY THE FIRST GERM OF DOUBT HAS BEEN SOWN IN REGARD TO THE UNCONDITIONAL LEGITIMACY AND GLORY OF THEIR OCCUPATION
ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN ONE EXPLAIN THE AMAZING CONTRADICTIONS WITH WHICH OUR LIFE IS FULL AND OF WHICH A STRIKING EXAMPLE WAS PRESENTED TO ME BY THE EXPEDITION I MET ON THE 9TH OF SEPTEMBER
THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL BEES WHO ARE BEGINNING TO SEPARATE FROM THE SWARM AND ARE FLYING NEAR IT WAITING TILL THE WHOLE SWARM CAN NO LONGER BE PREVENTED FROM STARTING OFF AFTER THEM
A MAN OTHERWISE SENSIBLE AND GOOD-HEARTED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS GIVEN A BADGE OR A UNIFORM TO WEAR AND TOLD THAT HE IS A GUARD OR CUSTOMS OFFICER IS READY TO FIRE ON PEOPLE AND NEITHER HE NOR THOSE AROUND HIM REGARD HIM AS TO BLAME FOR IT BUT ON THE CONTRARY WOULD REGARD HIM AS TO BLAME IF HE DID NOT FIRE
IF THE BIRD HAD WINGS AND DID NOT WANT TO BE CAUGHT IT WOULD NOT LET ONE PUT SALT ON ITS TAIL BECAUSE THE SPECIALTY OF A BIRD IS TO FLY
BUT PUTTING ASIDE THE SIN OF DELUDING MEN INTO REGARDING THE MOST AWFUL CRIME AS A DUTY PUTTING ASIDE THE REVOLTING SIN OF USING THE NAME AND AUTHORITY OF CHRIST TO SANCTION WHAT HE MOST CONDEMNED NOT TO SPEAK OF THE CURSE ON THOSE WHO CAUSE THESE LITTLE ONES TO OFFEND--HOW CAN PEOPLE WHO CHERISH THEIR OWN WAY OF LIFE THEIR PROGRESS EVEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY ALLOW THE FORMATION IN THEIR MIDST OF AN OVERWHELMING FORCE AS SENSELESS CRUEL AND DESTRUCTIVE AS EVERY GOVERNMENT IS ORGANIZED ON THE BASIS OF AN ARMY
SO THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY TWO OPPOSING CAMPS
AND OBVIOUSLY ALL THAT RESULTS FROM THIS IS ONLY GREATER POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORITIES AND GREATER OPPRESSION RESULTING FROM IT
AND HERE NOW IS THE VIEW LATELY EXPRESSED BY THE MOST POPULAR NOVELIST IN EUROPE EMILE ZOLA
AND THAT WOULD BE RIGHT ENOUGH IF IT WERE THE CASE AS THEY ASSUME THAT THE OPPRESSORS ARE ALWAYS THE BEST OF MEN AND THAT THE SOLE MEANS OF SAVING MEN FROM EVIL IS BY VIOLENCE
OTHER BELIEVERS IN SUPERNATURAL CHRISTIANITY HOLD THAT SALVATION WILL COME THROUGH THE CHURCH WHICH WILL DRAW ALL MEN INTO ITS FOLD TRAIN THEM IN THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES AND TRANSFORM THEIR LIFE
IF YOU ARE CONTENT WITH THE OLD WORLD TRY TO PRESERVE IT IT IS VERY SICK AND CANNOT HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER
THE GENERAL DELUSION IS DIFFUSED AMONG ALL PEOPLE BY MEANS OF THE CATECHISMS OR BOOKS WHICH NOWADAYS REPLACE THEM IN USE FOR THE COMPULSORY EDUCATION OF CHILDREN
THE POSITION OF OUR CHRISTIAN SOCIETY AND ESPECIALLY THE IDEALS MOST CURRENT IN IT PROVE THIS IN A STRIKINGLY CONVINCING WAY
AND IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS POSSIBLE TO RELY ON THE ARMY FOR THE PACIFICATION OF RIOTS AND MORE AND MORE EVIDENT CONSEQUENTLY THAT GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS ARE ONLY FIGURES IN SOLEMN PROCESSIONS--OBJECTS OF AMUSEMENT FOR GOVERNMENTS--A SORT OF IMMENSE--AND FAR TOO EXPENSIVE--CORPS DE BALLET
ALL THESE LADS PEASANTS FOR THE MOST PART KNOW WHAT IS THE BUSINESS THEY HAVE COME ABOUT
AND WHEN A GOOD-HEARTED LAD HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO A STATE LOWER THAN THAT OF A BRUTE HE IS JUST WHAT IS WANTED BY THOSE WHO USE HIM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF VIOLENCE
NOT ONE OF THE ERRORS OF MEN CARRIES THEM SO FAR AWAY FROM THE AIM TOWARD WHICH THEY ARE STRUGGLING AS THIS VERY ONE
SO THAT EVERY MAN WHO IS LED THROUGH HIS COMPULSORY SERVICE IN THE ARMY TO REFLECT ON THE VALUE OF THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE HE IS EXPECTED TO BE READY TO SACRIFICE HIS PEACE SECURITY AND LIFE CANNOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THERE IS NO KIND OF JUSTIFICATION IN MODERN TIMES FOR SUCH A SACRIFICE
LOOK HE IS NAKED THIS WILL BE EXACTLY THE SITUATION OF ALL WHO CONTINUE THROUGH INERTIA TO FILL OFFICES WHICH HAVE LONG BECOME USELESS DIRECTLY SOMEONE WHO HAS NO INTEREST IN CONCEALING THEIR USELESSNESS EXCLAIMS IN ALL SIMPLICITY
AND YET IF IT IS CLEAR THAT IT WAS ONLY BY MEANS OF MENACES BLOWS OR MURDER THAT THE MILL IN OREL WAS ENABLED TO YIELD A LARGER INCOME OR THAT THE FOREST WHICH THE PEASANTS HAD PLANTED BECAME THE PROPERTY OF A LANDOWNER IT SHOULD BE EQUALLY CLEAR THAT ALL THE OTHER EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS ENJOYED BY THE RICH BY ROBBING THE POOR OF THEIR NECESSITIES REST ON THE SAME BASIS OF VIOLENCE
SEE VOL
WHEN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF RESISTANCE THEY TAUGHT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT RESISTANCE CHRIST FORBADE
EVEN IF THERE ARE AS THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOME MEN WHO PREFER RENOUNCING POWER TO ENJOYING IT THE MASS OF MEN IN RESERVE WHO PREFER DOMINION TO SUBJECTION IS SO GREAT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A TIME WHEN THE NUMBER WILL BE EXHAUSTED
IF A MAN WERE TO CARRY OUT ALL THAT CHRIST TEACHES HE WOULD DESTROY HIS OWN LIFE
AND THERE WERE MEN WHO THOUGHT GOOD WHAT THE EXISTING AUTHORITIES REGARDED AS BAD AND WHO STRUGGLED AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES WITH THE SAME VIOLENCE AS WAS EMPLOYED AGAINST THEM
THE PRECEPT SHOWING THE LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CANNOT FALL IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS IDEAL IS THE PROHIBITION OF EVIL SPEAKING
MILITARY OFFICERS OF THE HIGHEST RANK INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING IN THEIR SOLDIERS THE BRUTALITY AND FEROCITY NECESSARY FOR THEIR WORK DIFFUSE EDUCATION AMONG THE SOLDIERS INCULCATE HUMANITY AND OFTEN EVEN THEMSELVES SHARE THE SOCIALISTIC IDEAS OF THE MASSES AND DENOUNCE WAR
I CANNOT RENOUNCE MY AUTHORITY AND LEAVE ONLY IMMORAL MEN IN CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT
AT LAST WITHOUT HAVING ONCE LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE THE DOCTOR SAYS RIGHT
THE VIOLENCE OF INTERNAL FEUD CRUSHED BY AUTHORITY REAPPEARS IN AUTHORITY ITSELF WHICH FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF MEN WHO LIKE THE REST ARE FREQUENTLY OR ALWAYS READY TO SACRIFICE THE PUBLIC WELFARE TO THEIR PERSONAL INTEREST WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT THEIR SUBJECTS CANNOT RESIST THEM AND THUS THEY ARE EXPOSED TO ALL THE DEMORALIZING INFLUENCE OF AUTHORITY
THE POSITION OF CHRISTIAN HUMANITY WITH ITS PRISONS GALLEYS GIBBETS ITS FACTORIES AND ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL ITS TAXES CHURCHES GIN-PALACES LICENSED BROTHELS ITS EVER-INCREASING ARMAMENT AND ITS MILLIONS OF BRUTALIZED MEN READY LIKE CHAINED DOGS TO ATTACK ANYONE AGAINST WHOM THEIR MASTER INCITES THEM WOULD BE TERRIBLE INDEED IF IT WERE THE PRODUCT OF VIOLENCE BUT IT IS PRE-EMINENTLY THE PRODUCT OF PUBLIC OPINION
I WILL SPEAK FIRST OF THE FORMER
FOR CATHOLICS THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ROMAN PRIESTHOOD AND THE POPE
THE ORTHODOX ASSERT THAT THE SAME HOLY GHOST HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED WITHOUT A BREAK IN THEIR PRIESTHOOD
THIS IS THE BASEST FALSEST LIE BY WHICH NOT BODIES ONLY BUT SOULS TOO ARE DESTROYED NO ONE DOES THIS
SO MUCH FOR THE COMPARATIVE DISADVANTAGES
I HAD HEARD OF THIS I HAD EVEN READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE FEARFUL FLOGGINGS WHICH HAD BEEN INFLICTED IN TCHERNIGOV TAMBOV SARATOV ASTRAKHAN AND OREL AND OF THOSE OF WHICH THE GOVERNOR OF NIJNI-NOVGOROD GENERAL BARANOV HAD BOASTED
IF LABOR IS TAXED BY AUTHORITY AND THE TAXES SPENT BY A FEW ON WHAT THEY THINK FIT
THEY DO NOT SEE THAT TO SAY THAT THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL IS AN EXAGGERATION IN CHRIST'S TEACHING IS JUST LIKE SAYING THAT THE STATEMENT OF THE EQUALITY OF THE RADII OF A CIRCLE IS AN EXAGGERATION IN THE DEFINITION OF A CIRCLE
AND EVERYONE NOT ONLY SEES THIS BUT VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HE TAKES PART IN MAINTAINING THIS DISTINCTION WHICH HIS CONSCIENCE CONDEMNS
SO IT IS WITH THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CHRISTIAN STANDARD OF OPINION ON FORCE AND ALL THAT IS BASED ON FORCE
SO THAT THE PROPHECY THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN MEN WILL BE TAUGHT OF GOD WILL LEARN WAR NO MORE WILL BEAT THEIR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND THEIR SPEARS INTO REAPING-HOOKS WHICH MEANS TRANSLATING IT INTO OUR LANGUAGE THE FORTRESSES PRISONS BARRACKS PALACES AND CHURCHES WILL REMAIN EMPTY AND ALL THE GIBBETS AND GUNS AND CANNONS WILL BE LEFT UNUSED IS NO LONGER A DREAM BUT THE DEFINITE NEW FORM OF LIFE TO WHICH MANKIND IS APPROACHING WITH EVER-INCREASING RAPIDITY
ALL THIS FAR FROM BEING DETRIMENTAL IS EVEN OF SERVICE TO GOVERNMENTS BY TURNING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PRESSING QUESTION
AND NO ONE CAN SAY BEFOREHAND WHETHER HE WILL CARRY OUT THE SUGGESTION OR NOT
IF ONE SET ONESELF THE TASK OF TRYING TO CONFUSE A MAN SO THAT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY NOR FREE HIMSELF FROM THE PERPLEXITY OF TWO OPPOSING THEORIES OF LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN INSTILLED INTO HIM FROM CHILDHOOD ONE COULD NOT INVENT ANY MEANS MORE EFFECTUAL THAN THE TREATMENT OF EVERY YOUNG MAN EDUCATED IN OUR SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN SOCIETY
WE HAVE SEEN MEN TURNED TO BRUTES FRENZIED KILLING FOR FUN FOR TERROR FOR BRAVADO FOR OSTENTATION
TO SEE CLEARLY HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING FROM SUCH A POINT OF VIEW ONE MUST FORM FOR ONESELF AN IDEA OF THE PLACE ACTUALLY HELD BY RELIGIONS IN GENERAL BY THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IN PARTICULAR IN THE LIFE OF MANKIND AND OF THE SIGNIFICANCE ATTRIBUTED TO THEM BY SCIENCE
MILITARY SLAVERY IS AN ACTUAL FACT AND IT IS THE WORST FORM OF SLAVERY ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN BY MEANS OF COMPULSORY SERVICE IT LAYS ITS FETTERS ON THE NECKS OF ALL THE STRONG AND CAPABLE MEN OF A NATION TO MAKE THEM INSTRUMENTS OF MURDER BUTCHERS OF HUMAN FLESH FOR THAT IS ALL THEY ARE TAKEN AND TRAINED TO DO
THE SPIRIT IN WHOM THEY LIVE MAKES THEM CONTENTED AND HAPPY IN EVERY POSITION
IT IS THE RESULT OF THE IGNORANCE BRUTALITY AND INTEMPERANCE OF THE PEOPLE
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY THEY TOLD ME IF I WANTED TO CATCH A BIRD I MUST PUT SALT ON ITS TAIL
BUT THE SIMPLEST THING CANNOT BE MADE CLEAR TO THE MOST INTELLIGENT MAN IF HE IS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE KNOWS ALREADY WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBT WHAT IS LAID BEFORE HIM
SO THAT THE RECOMMENDATION TO MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL TO PREACH ON THE EVIL OF WAR AND THE BLESSING OF PEACE EVERY THIRD SUNDAY IN DECEMBER IS QUITE SUPERFLUOUS
OUR CONFIDENCE IS IN THE LORD ALMIGHTY AND NOT IN MAN
AND THAT IS THE CONDITION OF ALL MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY
BALLOU DIED IN AUGUST 1890 AND THERE WAS AS OBITUARY NOTICE OF HIM IN AN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHRISTIAN VIEWS RELIGIO-PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNAL AUGUST 23 IN THIS LAUDATORY NOTICE IT IS RECORDED THAT BALLOU WAS THE SPIRITUAL DIRECTOR OF A PARISH THAT HE DELIVERED FROM EIGHT TO NINE THOUSAND SERMONS MARRIED ONE THOUSAND COUPLES AND WROTE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED ARTICLES
WHETHER THEY ARE BREAKING THAT FUNDAMENTAL COMMANDMENT THAT FORBIDS KILLING WITHOUT LAWFUL CAUSE
THAT IS TO RECOGNIZE AND PROFESS THE TRUTH
BUT THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE
AND YET SIMPLY FROM THE FACT THAT OTHER MEN AS MISGUIDED AND AS PITIFUL CREATURES AS YOURSELF HAVE MADE YOU SOLDIER TZAR LANDOWNER CAPITALIST PRIEST OR GENERAL YOU UNDERTAKE TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OBVIOUSLY OPPOSED TO YOUR REASON AND YOUR HEART TO BASE YOUR EXISTENCE ON THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS AND ABOVE ALL INSTEAD OF FILLING THE ONE DUTY OF YOUR LIFE RECOGNIZING AND PROFESSING THE TRUTH YOU FEIGN NOT TO RECOGNIZE IT AND DISGUISE IT FROM YOURSELF AND OTHERS
TO REFUSE TO SERVE IN THE ARMY IN WHICH THE TZAR HIMSELF SERVES AND WHICH ENJOYS THE BLESSING OF THE CHURCH SEEMS INSANITY FROM THE OFFICIAL POINT OF VIEW
HE CANNOT STOP AND CEASE DOING WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO DO
THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN THE CHURCH'S DOCTRINE OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF WARFARE AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WITH CHRISTIANITY CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF ALL MEN
MEANING OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE UNDERSTOOD BY A MINORITY HAS BECOME COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MEN--REASON OF THIS TO BE FOUND IN MISINTERPRETATION OF CHRISTIANITY AND MISTAKEN CONVICTION OF BELIEVERS AND UNBELIEVERS ALIKE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IT--THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY OBSCURED FOR BELIEVERS BY THE CHURCH--THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF CHRIST'S TEACHING--ITS ESSENCE AND DIFFERENCE FROM HEATHEN RELIGIONS--CHRISTIANITY NOT FULLY COMPREHENDED AT THE BEGINNING BECAME MORE AND MORE CLEAR TO THOSE WHO ACCEPTED IT FROM ITS CORRESPONDENCE WITH TRUTH--SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THIS AROSE THE CLAIM TO POSSESSION OF THE AUTHENTIC MEANING OF THE DOCTRINE BASED ON THE MIRACULOUS NATURE OF ITS TRANSMISSION--ASSEMBLY OF DISCIPLES AS DESCRIBED IN THE ACTS--THE AUTHORITATIVE CLAIM TO THE SOLE POSSESSION OF THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING SUPPORTED BY MIRACULOUS EVIDENCE HAS LED BY LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE CREEDS OF THE CHURCHES--A CHURCH COULD NOT BE FOUNDED BY
AMONG THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SINCE THE AGE OF PETER I THE PROTEST OF CHRISTIANITY AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER CEASED AND THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN SUCH THAT MEN EMIGRATE IN COMMUNES TO TURKEY TO CHINA AND TO UNINHABITED LANDS AND NOT ONLY FEEL NO NEED OF STATE AID BUT ALWAYS REGARD THE STATE AS A USELESS BURDEN ONLY TO BE ENDURED AS A MISFORTUNE WHETHER IT HAPPENS TO BE TURKISH RUSSIAN OR CHINESE
THEY DO ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THEIR AIM BUT NOT THE ONE SIMPLE OBVIOUS THING WHICH IS WITHIN REACH OF EVERYONE
THESE ARE MOSTLY GIFTED AND SENSITIVE MEN WHO SEE AND REALIZE ALL THE HORROR AND IMBECILITY AND CRUELTY OF WAR BUT THROUGH SOME STRANGE PERVERSION OF MIND NEITHER SEE NOR SEEK TO FIND ANY WAY OUT OF THIS POSITION AND SEEM TO TAKE PLEASURE IN TEASING THE WOUND BY DWELLING ON THE DESPERATE POSITION OF HUMANITY
ALL THAT WOULD RESULT WOULD BE THAT THE BAD WOULD OPPRESS AND OUTRAGE THE GOOD WITH IMPUNITY
AND THEREFORE THE TRANSFORMATION OF HUMAN LIFE THROUGH WHICH MEN IN POWER WILL RENOUNCE IT AND THERE WILL BE NONE ANXIOUS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE WILL NOT COME ONLY BY ALL MEN CONSCIOUSLY AND SEPARATELY ASSIMILATING THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE
INDEED ASK EVERY MAN SEPARATELY WHETHER HE THINKS IT LAUDABLE AND WORTHY OF A MAN OF THIS AGE TO HOLD A POSITION FROM WHICH HE RECEIVES A SALARY DISPROPORTIONATE TO HIS WORK
20 21 THE END
IN THE SECOND CASE HE WILL BE STRENGTHENED IN HIS VICE AND WILL DEPRIVE HIMSELF OF EVERY POSSIBILITY OF SHAKING IT OFF
MAY HE KILL OR MAIM HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE
ON THIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE NECESSITY AND THEREFORE IMMUTABILITY OF THE EXISTING ORDER ALL WHO TAKE PART IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT BASE THE ARGUMENT ALWAYS ADVANCED IN THEIR JUSTIFICATION
NOT ONLY WAS IT UNKNOWN IN EUROPE EVEN THE AMERICANS WHO HAVE SUCH A HIGH OPINION OF GARRISON HARDLY KNEW OF THE DECLARATION
IF WE DRAW A LINE EXCLUDING FROM HUMANITY ITS LOWEST REPRESENTATIVES WHERE ARE WE TO DRAW THE LINE
MEN BEGIN TO CRITICISE THEIR ACTIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW TRUTH BUT IN THE MEANTIME IN PRACTICE THROUGH INERTIA AND TRADITION THEY CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES WHICH ONCE REPRESENTED THE HIGHEST POINT OF RATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS BUT ARE NOW IN FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION WITH IT
CHRIST'S TEACHING ONLY HAS POWER WHEN IT DEMANDS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION--THAT IS THE FUSION OF THE DIVINE NATURE WHICH EXISTS IN EVERY MAN'S SOUL WITH THE WILL OF GOD--THE UNION OF THE SON WITH THE FATHER
THE AUTHORITIES THOSE WHO HAVE STARTED DEVISED AND DECREED THE MATTER WILL SAY THAT SUCH ACTS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING ORDER
THE PRODIGAL SON THE PIECE OF MONEY LOST AND FOUND AGAIN WERE MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE THAT WERE NOT LOST
YET ONE IS PLEASED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ARTIST IS NOT WHOLLY LOST IN THE THINKER
HE WAS SHUT OFF FROM ALL HUMAN EXISTENCE
THE TIME WILL COME--IT IS ALREADY COMING--WHEN THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY NON-RESISTANCE OF EVIL BY FORCE WILL APPEAR JUST AS NATURAL AND SIMPLE AS THE PRINCIPLES OF FAMILY OR SOCIAL LIFE SEEM TO US NOW
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NOT UNDERSTOOD
AND EVERYONE TAKEN SEPARATELY ESPECIALLY IF ONE'S REMARKS ARE DIRECTED AT SOMEONE ELSE NOT HIMSELF WILL ANSWER NO
AND STRANGE AND TERRIBLE TO SAY THE CULTIVATED MEN OF OUR DAY THE LEADERS OF THOUGHT ARE IN REALITY WITH THEIR SUBTLE REASONING DRAWING SOCIETY BACK NOT TO PAGANISM EVEN BUT TO A STATE OF PRIMITIVE BARBARISM
WE REGARD AS UNCHRISTIAN AND UNLAWFUL EVERY EDICT OF GOVERNMENT REQUIRING OF ITS SUBJECTS MILITARY SERVICE
ONE SPIRITUAL AND INTERNAL THE OTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND EXTERNAL
WHICH WILL GAIN THE UPPER HAND THE RATIONAL CONSCIENCE OR THE IRRATIONAL SUGGESTION
BUT AMONG THE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT IS DONE THIS IS WHAT IS TAUGHT AND NOTHING MORE
IF THIS IS SO AND ONE CAN AND OUGHT TO MURDER AND TORTURE THERE IS NOT AND CANNOT BE ANY KIND OF MORAL LAW BUT ONLY THE LAW THAT MIGHT IS RIGHT
DIVERGENCIES IN SECONDARY MATTERS ARISE FREELY IN EAST AND WEST
THE PRECEPTS OF THE STATE THEORY OF LIFE INSIST FOR THE MOST PART ON CERTAIN PRACTICAL PRESCRIBED ACTS BY WHICH MEN ARE JUSTIFIED AND SECURE OF BEING RIGHT
MAN LOVES NOT BECAUSE IT IS HIS INTEREST TO LOVE THIS OR THAT BUT BECAUSE LOVE IS THE ESSENCE OF HIS SOUL BECAUSE HE CANNOT BUT LOVE
THESE PRINCIPLES HOWEVER FOLLOW FROM THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE JUST AS LOGICALLY AS THE PRINCIPLES OF PAYING A PART OF ONE'S PRIVATE GAINS TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND OF SACRIFICING ONE'S LIFE IN DEFENSE OF ONE'S COUNTRY FOLLOW FROM THE STATE THEORY OF LIFE
HE KNOWS TOO THAT THERE MAY BE CHANGES ANY DAY IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT WHAT WAS A GROUND FOR ADVANCEMENT YESTERDAY MAY BE THE CAUSE OF DISGRACE TO-MORROW
AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER AS I WAS PASSING THROUGH TOULA I SAW ONCE AGAIN AT THE GATES OF THE ZEMSKY COURTHOUSE THE CROWD OF PEASANTS I HAD SO OFTEN SEEN BEFORE AND HEARD THE DRUNKEN SHOUTS OF THE MEN MINGLED WITH THE PITIFUL LAMENTATIONS OF THEIR WIVES AND MOTHERS
NEITHER SHALL THEY SAY LO HERE
BUT WHAT IF I LEAVE THE HOUSE AND GIVE UP EVERY CONVENIENCE FOR A TIME AND THE NEW HOUSE IS NOT BUILT OR IS BUILT ON A DIFFERENT PLAN SO THAT I DO NOT FIND IN IT THE COMFORTS TO WHICH I AM ACCUSTOMED BUT SEEING THAT THE MATERIALS AND THE BUILDERS ARE HERE THERE IS EVERY LIKELIHOOD THAT THE NEW HOUSE WILL ON THE CONTRARY BE BETTER BUILT THAN THE OLD ONE
BUT HOWEVER MUCH THEY TRY TO DECEIVE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THEY ALL KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS OPPOSED TO ALL THE BELIEFS WHICH THEY PROFESS AND IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR SOULS WHEN THEY ARE LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE THEY ARE ASHAMED AND MISERABLE AT THE RECOLLECTION OF IT ESPECIALLY IF THE BASENESS OF THEIR ACTION HAS BEEN POINTED OUT TO THEM
THE FIRST COURSE HAS BEEN TRIED EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF HISTORICAL TIMES AND AS WE ALL KNOW IT HAS NOT HITHERTO LED TO ANY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS
ALL THE LATER DECISIONS EVEN THAT OF THE SENATE THOUGH THEY COULD SEE THAT THE MATTER HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY DECIDED CONFIRMED THE JUDGMENT AND ADJUDGED THE FOREST TO THE LANDOWNER
NOT HAVING FOLLOWED CHRIST'S TEACHING GENERALLY AND ITS APPLICATION TO SOCIAL LIFE IN NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL MEN HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES TO THE INEVITABLE DESTRUCTION FORETOLD BY CHRIST FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT FULFILL HIS TEACHING
IF THEY COULD ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTAKE OR ERROR IT WOULD ONLY BE IN FUNCTIONARIES OF A LOWER GRADE
THE CORRUPTION OF CHRISTIANITY AND ITS ACCEPTANCE IN ITS CORRUPT FORM BY THE MAJORITY OF MEN WAS AS NECESSARY AS IT IS THAT THE SEED SHOULD REMAIN HIDDEN FOR A CERTAIN TIME IN THE EARTH IN ORDER TO GERMINATE
BUT SO SOON AS IT IS A QUESTION OF WAR THAT IS OF SHEDDING BLOOD IN TORRENTS MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY DO NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT A SUFFICIENT CAUSE
OR TO CHEAT THE WORKMAN IN A FACTORY BY IMPOSING FINES FOR ACCIDENTALLY SPOILED ARTICLES
TO ALL RUSSIAN CRITICS THE WHOLE IMPORT OF CHRIST'S COMMAND SEEMED REDUCIBLE TO THE FACT THAT IT WOULD HINDER THEM FROM THE ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO EVIL TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED
AND IN ALLEGIANCE TO IT I HAVE SWORN TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF MY COUNTRY IF NEED BE WITH MY LIFE
UNDER THE PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE WILL OF THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITIES WITHOUT INFRINGING THE LAW OF GOD EXPRESSED IN CIRCUMCISIONS SABBATHS FIXED TIMES OF PRAYER ABSTENTION FROM CERTAIN KINDS OF FOOD AND SO ON
WHICH WAS BAD THEN AND WHICH WAS GOOD
IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIM THAT ON HIS DEATH-BED A MAN MUST NOT FAIL TO EAT BREAD AND WINE WITH A SPOON AND THAT IT WILL BE STILL BETTER IF HE HAS TIME TO BE RUBBED WITH SACRED OIL
CAPRIVI ONLY SAID ALOUD WHAT EVERY STATESMAN KNOWS AND ASSIDUOUSLY CONCEALS FROM THE PEOPLE
THAT YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART THE FAITH YOU PROFESS AND EVEN SCIENCE ITSELF TELL YOU THE SAME THING AND YET THAT IN SPITE OF IT ALL YOU CAN BE FORCED BY SOME CONFUSED AND COMPLICATED REASONING TO ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO ALL THIS
HE SEES THAT IT IS CAUSED BY GOVERNMENTS FORCING MEN BY DECEPTION TO GO OUT TO SLAUGHTER AND BE SLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVANTAGE TO THEMSELVES
THEY LIE AND DELUDE THEMSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER WITH THE SUBTLEST FORMS OF DECEPTION SIMPLY TO OBSCURE TO DEADEN CONSCIENCE
AND PARTLY IT IS DUE TO MY FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE LOFTY CIVILIZATION TO WHICH MANKIND HAS ATTAINED AT PRESENT WITH ITS KRUPP CANNONS SMOKELESS POWDER COLONIZATION OF AFRICA IRISH COERCION BILL PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT JOURNALISM STRIKES AND THE EIFFEL TOWER
SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO AND ALWAYS WILL BE IN EVERY CASE OF MARTYRDOM
AND IT FELL
PIOTR SIDOROV STARTS CROSSES HIMSELF AND GOES INTO A LITTLE ROOM WITH A GLASS DOOR WHERE THE CONSCRIPTS UNDRESS
BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND OCCURRED
ALL THESE FRAGMENTS OF THE GLOBE HAVE COME TO GATHER ROUND THE PALACE OF WAR AND IN TURN OUR GUESTS MOUNT GUARD SUBMISSIVELY BEFORE THE MOTHER BUILDING BUT FOR WHOM THEY WOULD NOT BE HERE
JUST IN PROPORTION TO THE FAILURE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTRINE WAS THEIR NEED OF EXTERNAL CONFIRMATION OF THEIR INCOMPLETE INTERPRETATION OF IT
THE SECOND IS THE IDEA THAT THE WHOLE PURPORT OF CHRISTIANITY IS TO TEACH MEN TO LIVE ADVANTAGEOUSLY TOGETHER AS ONE FAMILY AND THAT TO ATTAIN THIS WE NEED ONLY FOLLOW THE RULE OF LOVE TO HUMANITY DISMISSING ALL THOUGHT OF LOVE OF GOD ALTOGETHER
LIFE ACCORDING TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS A PROGRESS TOWARD THE DIVINE PERFECTION
WHEN ONE HEARS FOR WHOLE DAYS AT A TIME AS I HEAR IT IN HAMOVNIKY WHERE I LIVE THE WHISTLE OF BALLS AND THE DULL THUD AS THEY FALL IN THE SAND
ON ONE OF THE ESTATES OF A RICH LANDOWNER THE PEASANTS HAD COMMON RIGHTS ON THE FOREST AND HAVING ALWAYS ENJOYED THESE RIGHTS REGARDED THE FOREST AS THEIR OWN OR AT LEAST AS THEIRS IN COMMON WITH THE OWNER
ANY CIVIL RELIGIOUS OR MILITARY OFFICIAL IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOY WHO SERVES THE STATE FROM VANITY OR AS IS MOST OFTEN THE CASE SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE PAY WRUNG FROM THE HARASSED AND TOILWORN WORKING CLASSES ALL TAXES HOWEVER RAISED ALWAYS FALL ON LABOR IF HE AS IS VERY SELDOM THE CASE DOES NOT DIRECTLY ROB THE GOVERNMENT IN THE USUAL WAY CONSIDERS HIMSELF AND IS CONSIDERED BY HIS FELLOWS AS A MOST USEFUL AND VIRTUOUS MEMBER OF SOCIETY
THE SLAVE OF ANTIQUITY KNEW THAT HE WAS A SLAVE BY NATURE BUT OUR LABORER WHILE HE FEELS HE IS A SLAVE KNOWS THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO BE AND SO HE TASTES THE AGONY OF TANTALUS FOREVER DESIRING AND NEVER GAINING WHAT MIGHT AND OUGHT TO BE HIS
DO IT YOURSELVES IF YOU WANT IT DONE
THEOLOGY IS NOT WEDDED TO INVARIABLE FORMULAS
THE PEOPLE ARE ADVANCING TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MORAL LIVING SIDE OF CHRISTIANITY
THE ARIANS ASSERTED THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS TRANSMITTED IN THEIR PRIESTHOOD THEY ASSERTED THIS WITH JUST AS MUCH RIGHT AS THE CHURCHES IN AUTHORITY NOW THE PROTESTANTS OF EVERY KIND--LUTHERANS REFORMED CHURCH PRESBYTERIANS METHODISTS SWEDENBORGIANS MORMONS--ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS ONLY PRESENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
AND IT HAS BEEN DONE ACCORDINGLY
THE MAN WHO IS AT A LOWER LEVEL BUT IS MOVING ONWARD TOWARD PERFECTION IS LIVING A MORE MORAL A BETTER LIFE IS MORE FULLY CARRYING OUT CHRIST'S TEACHING THAN THE MAN ON A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF MORALITY WHO IS NOT MOVING ONWARD TOWARD PERFECTION
SO THAT ONE MIGHT SEEK IN VAIN IN HISTORY AN EPOCH MORE INSECURE MORE CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SUFFERING FOOTNOTE
BUT THE MAN WHO LOVES HUMANITY--WHAT DOES HE LOVE
THE PERSONS IN AUTHORITY OF THE HIGHER ORDERS--LANDOWNERS MERCHANTS JUDGES SENATORS GOVERNORS MINISTERS TZARS AND OFFICERS--TAKE PART IN SUCH DOINGS BECAUSE THE EXISTING ORDER IS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
I KNOW THAT I DO NOT NEED TO ATTACK AND SLAUGHTER OTHER NATIONS OR TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM THEM WITH ARMS AND THEREFORE I CAN TAKE NO PART IN WARS OR PREPARATIONS FOR WARS
THEY SAY THAT THE CHRISTIAN LIFE CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED WITHOUT THE USE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE THERE ARE SAVAGE RACES OUTSIDE THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN SOCIETIES IN AFRICA AND IN ASIA THERE ARE SOME WHO EVEN REPRESENT THE CHINESE AS A DANGER TO CIVILIZATION AND THAT IN THE MIDST OF CHRISTIAN SOCIETIES THERE ARE SAVAGE CORRUPT AND ACCORDING TO THE NEW THEORY OF HEREDITY CONGENITAL CRIMINALS
AND IF IT WERE ONLY A GENERATION THAT MUST BE SACRIFICED
IT IS NOT THAT THEY HAVE NOT A CONSCIENCE WHICH FORBIDS THEM FROM ACTING THUS JUST AS EVEN THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE BURNT MEN AT THE STAKE AND PUT THEM TO THE RACK THEY HAD A CONSCIENCE WHICH PROHIBITED IT
I KNEW WHAT HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT BY THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH--ORIGEN TERTULLIAN AND OTHERS--I KNEW TOO OF THE EXISTENCE OF SOME SO-CALLED SECTS OF MENNONITES HERRNHUTERS AND QUAKERS WHO DO NOT ALLOW A CHRISTIAN THE USE OF WEAPONS AND DO NOT ENTER MILITARY SERVICE
FATE OF THE BOOK WHAT I BELIEVE"--EVASIVE CHARACTER OF RELIGIOUS CRITICISMS OF PRINCIPLES OF MY BOOK--1ST REPLY
WE BELIEVE THAT A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITIZEN THE TIME HAS COME TO RECOGNIZE THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS AND TO RENOUNCE AT ONCE AND FOREVER ALL THOSE UNDERTAKINGS BASED ON FRAUD AND FORCE WHICH UNDER THE NAME OF CONQUESTS ARE VERITABLE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND WHICH WHATEVER THE VANITY OF MONARCHS AND THE PRIDE OF NATIONS MAY THINK OF THEM ONLY WEAKEN EVEN THOSE WHO ARE TRIUMPHANT OVER THEM I AM SURPRISED AT THE WAY RELIGION IS CARRIED ON IN THIS COUNTRY SAID SIR WILFRID LAWSON AT THE SAME CONGRESS

EVERY NAVAL SHIP EVERY ARSENAL EVERY FORTIFICATION WE REGARD AS UNCHRISTIAN AND UNLAWFUL
IS IT POSSIBLE THEY MUST FIRE ON THEM
ONE OFTEN WONDERS WHY INDEPENDENT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FORCED TO DO SO IN ANY WAY THE SO-CALLED ELITE OF SOCIETY SHOULD GO INTO THE ARMY IN RUSSIA ENGLAND GERMANY AUSTRIA AND EVEN FRANCE AND SEEK OPPORTUNITIES OF BECOMING MURDERERS
AND TO REPLY THAT THAT IS EVIL WHICH I THINK EVIL IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT MY OPPONENT THINKS IT GOOD IS NOT A SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY
ALL SUCH SO-CALLED HERETICAL WORKS WERE BURNED AT THE STAKE TOGETHER WITH THEIR AUTHORS SO THAT THERE ARE FEW ANCIENT WORKS EXPOSING THE ERRORS OF OFFICIAL CHRISTIANITY
WHO IS TO FORCE STATES TO DELAY THEIR OPERATIONS FOR A CERTAIN FIXED TIME
WE SHALL BE ABLE TO OBSERVE THERE HOW THE MOST TENACIOUS OF OUR INSTINCTS WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF ITS VIGOR IS TRANSFORMED AND ADAPTED TO THE VARYING EXIGENCIES OF HISTORICAL EPOCHS M
WHEN THE WOOD MERCHANT AS I SUSPECT INSINCERELY ONLY TO SHOW THAT HE WAS A MAN OF EDUCATION BEGAN TO SPEAK OF THE NECESSITY OF SUCH MEASURES THE SOLDIERS WHO HEARD HIM ALL TURNED AWAY FROM HIM SCOWLING AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
HUMANITY IS CREATED TO LIVE TO LIVE FREE TO PERFECT AND AMELIORATE ITS FATE BY PEACEFUL LABOR
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE PROVES IT
BY SUCH A STEADFAST REFUSAL TO MAKE USE OF FORCE YOU CALL DOWN ON YOURSELVES THE BLESSING PROMISED TO THOSE WHO HEAR THESE SAYINGS AND DO THEM AND THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE WORLD WILL RECOGNIZE YOU AS HAVING AIDED IN THE REFORMATION OF MANKIND
CHRISTIANITY IS A NEW AND HIGHER CONCEPTION OF LIFE
AND TO FULFILL THE WILL OF GOD HE IS READY TO SACRIFICE HIS INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY AND SOCIAL WELFARE
HE CANNOT OPPOSE INJURY TO INJURY WHETHER HE IS ALONE OR WITH OTHERS EITHER IN PERSON OR THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE
THERE IS THE SAME DUTY LAID ON THEIR CONGREGATIONS TO BELIEVE IN THE DOGMAS EXPRESSED IN THE FOURTH CENTURY WHICH HAVE LOST ALL MEANING FOR MEN OF OUR TIMES AND THE SAME DUTY OF IDOLATROUS WORSHIP IF NOT OF RELICS AND IKONS THEN OF THE SABBATH DAY AND THE LETTER OF THE BIBLE
MY MEAT IS TO DO THE WILL OF HIM THAT SENT ME AND TO PERFORM HIS WORKS
WHEN MORE THAN FIFTY STROKES HAD BEEN GIVEN THE PEASANT CEASED TO SHRIEK AND WRITHE AND THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN EDUCATED IN A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION TO SERVE HIS SOVEREIGN AND HIS COUNTRY WITH HIS SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS WENT UP TO THE VICTIM FELT HIS PULSE LISTENED TO HIS HEART AND ANNOUNCED TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITY THAT THE MAN UNDERGOING PUNISHMENT HAD LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF SCIENCE TO CONTINUE THE PUNISHMENT WOULD ENDANGER THE VICTIM'S LIFE
THESE PEASANTS ARE ABUSED BEATEN SHUT UP IN PRISON BUT THEY STICK TO THEIR RESOLUTION AND DON'T FILL THESE OFFICES AGAINST THEIR CONVICTIONS
MAN WOULD NOT BE FREE IF HE KNEW NO TRUTH AT ALL AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD NOT BE FREE AND WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE ANY IDEA OF FREEDOM IF THE WHOLE TRUTH WHICH WAS TO GUIDE HIM IN LIFE HAD BEEN REVEALED ONCE FOR ALL TO HIM IN ALL ITS PURITY WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF ERROR
THOSE RACES WOULD VINDICATE NATURE'S REASONING AGAINST HUMAN REASON
SO THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE THE CONDEMNATION OF THOSE WHOM THEY WANT TO PUNISH NEVER INTRUST THEM TO THE ORDINARY TRIBUNALS BUT HAVE THEM TRIED BEFORE A COURT MARTIAL WHICH IS ONLY A PARODY OF JUSTICE
IT IS THE SAME IN REGARD TO GOVERNMENTS
THE MILITARY OFFICERS HAVE GIVEN AND RECEIVED ORDERS ABOUT CARTRIDGES
WHAT ELSE HAS CATHOLICISM DONE WHAT ELSE IS IT DOING IN ITS PROHIBITION OF READING THE GOSPEL AND IN ITS DEMAND FOR UNREASONING SUBMISSION TO CHURCH AUTHORITIES AND TO AN INFALLIBLE POPE
BUT NOTHING OF THE SORT WAS DONE BY HIM
IN REPUBLICAN STATES THEY TEACH THEM THE SAVAGE SUPERSTITION OF PATRIOTISM AND THE SAME PRETENDED OBEDIENCE TO THE GOVERNING AUTHORITIES
THEY SEE THAT THE PROPHECY OF CHRISTIANITY IS COMING TO PASS THAT IT IS LOOSENING THE FETTERS OF THOSE IN CHAINS AND SETTING FREE THEM THAT ARE IN BONDAGE AND THAT THIS MUST INEVITABLY BE THE END OF ALL OPPRESSORS
WHAT A STRIKING CONTRAST BETWEEN WORDS AND DEEDS
THIS LACK OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS AT SUCH A TIME WOULD BE INEXPLICABLE IF THERE WERE NOT CAUSES TO ACCOUNT FOR IT
WE HAVE AN ASTOUNDING EXAMPLE OF THE OBSCURITY OF WORKS WHICH AIM AT EXPOUNDING THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE AND AT CONFUTING THOSE WHO DO NOT RECOGNIZE THIS COMMANDMENT IN THE BOOK OF THE TSECH HELCHITSKY WHICH HAS ONLY LATELY BEEN NOTICED AND HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN PRINTED
THEY SEND HIM TO THE ASYLUM IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL REMAIN THERE LIKE ANOTHER YOUNG MAN WHO REFUSED TEN YEARS AGO AT TVER TO SERVE IN THE ARMY AND WHO WAS TORTURED IN THE ASYLUM TILL HE SUBMITTED
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN NECESSARY AND HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE NECESSARY WITH THE INCREASED DIFFUSION OF EDUCATION AMONG THE MASSES WITH THE IMPROVED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PEOPLE OF THE SAME AND OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES
AND ALREADY THEY ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND IT
WE CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE WITHOUT HORROR THE POSSIBILITY OF A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THESE PEOPLE AND OURSELVES WHICH WOULD CALL FOR RECIPROCAL MURDER
HOWEVER ONE MAY ADMIT THAT AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS BETWEEN THE NATIONS INTERESTED COULD AID TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IN BRINGING ABOUT THE GOOD UNDERSTANDING INDISPENSABLE TO ANY NEGOTIATIONS AND WOULD RENDER POSSIBLE A CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION OF THE MILITARY EXPENDITURE WHICH IS CRUSHING THE NATIONS OF EUROPE AND GREATLY HINDERING THE SOLUTION OF THE SOCIAL QUESTION WHICH EACH INDIVIDUALLY MUST SOLVE ON PAIN OF HAVING INTERNAL WAR AS THE PRICE FOR ESCAPING IT EXTERNALLY
LET THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO TEACH US AND GUIDE US SET US THE EXAMPLE OF GIVING UP LEGAL MURDER AND THEN WE WILL IMITATE THEM AND THEY SAY THIS NOT AS A JEST BUT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT IS THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE CASE
THE LANDOWNER SENT WORKMEN TO DIG THE CONDUIT BY WHICH THE WATER WAS TO BE LET OFF TO TURN THE MILL
WERE NOT THEY ALL FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE VOCATIONS OF TZAR MINISTER GOVERNOR JUDGE NOBLEMAN LANDOWNER SUPERINTENDENT OFFICER AND SOLDIER ARE SOMETHING REAL AND IMPORTANT NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD EVEN THINK WITHOUT HORROR AND AVERSION OF TAKING PART IN WHAT THEY DO NOW
APART FROM THE IMMORALITY AND EVIL EFFECTS OF IT NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE MORE UNSAFE
AND AT THAT LIMIT MAN'S POWER OF TRANSFERRING HIS INTEREST CEASES AND HE CANNOT FEEL ANY DIRECT SENTIMENT FOR THAT FICTITIOUS ENTITY
ALL THE CONGRESSES OF BOTH HEMISPHERES MAY VOTE AGAINST WAR AND AGAINST DUELING TOO BUT ABOVE ALL ARBITRATIONS CONVENTIONS AND LEGISLATIONS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THE PERSONAL HONOR OF INDIVIDUAL MEN WHICH HAS ALWAYS DEMANDED DUELING AND THE INTERESTS OF NATIONS WHICH WILL ALWAYS DEMAND WAR
THOSE WHO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES BY THE FIRST METHOD DIRECTLY CRUDELY ASSERTING THAT CHRIST SANCTIONED VIOLENCE WARS AND MURDER REPUDIATE CHRIST'S DOCTRINE DIRECTLY
AND IT IS IN REGARD TO THESE TRUTHS THAT THE MAN'S FREEDOM MANIFESTS ITSELF
IN REALITY IN ORDER TO REACH THE PLACE TO WHICH HE WANTS TO GO HE MUST ROW WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH TOWARD A POINT MUCH HIGHER UP
BUT THEY ADHERE TO THEIR RESOLUTION AND DO NOT TAKE THE OATH
THEN WE SELL THEM SPIRITS TOBACCO AND OPIUM I
THOSE IN WHOM THE IDEA HAS BEEN INSTILLED THAT THEY ARE INVESTED WITH A SPECIAL SUPERNATURAL GRANDEUR AND CONSEQUENCE ARE SO INTOXICATED WITH A SENSE OF THEIR OWN IMAGINARY DIGNITY THAT THEY CEASE TO FEEL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DO
BUT THIS TRANSITION THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PASSING FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS SEEMS ARBITRARY UNNATURAL AND ALARMING
IT WILL COME WHEN A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION HAS ARISEN SO DEFINITE AND EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE AS TO REACH THE WHOLE OF THE INERT MASS WHICH IS NOT ABLE TO ATTAIN TRUTH BY ITS OWN INTUITION AND THEREFORE IS ALWAYS UNDER THE SWAY OF PUBLIC OPINION
TO PRAY MEANS TO PLACE HIMSELF DIRECTLY BEFORE THE WOODEN BOARDS ON WHICH ARE PAINTED THE FACES OF CHRIST THE MOTHER OF GOD AND THE SAINTS TO BOW HIS HEAD AND HIS WHOLE BODY AND TO TOUCH HIS FOREHEAD HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS STOMACH WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HOLDING HIS FINGERS IN A CERTAIN POSITION AND TO UTTER SOME WORDS OF SLAVONIC THE MOST USUAL OF WHICH AS TAUGHT TO ALL CHILDREN ARE
I WAS REGARDED AS AN ARRANT FANATIC
ONE NEED BUT REFLECT ON THE UNCEASING PERSISTENT STRUGGLE OF ALL TO BETTER THEIR MATERIAL POSITION WHICH IS THE GUIDING MOTIVE OF MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE RICH OVER THE POOR COULD NEVER AND CAN NEVER BE MAINTAINED BY ANYTHING BUT FORCE
PEOPLE ASK HOW WILL OUR SECURITY BE GUARANTEED WHEN THE EXISTING ORGANIZATION IS SUPPRESSED
THE MAN IS NOT FREE TO REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THE FIRST NOR TO RECOGNIZE THE SECOND CLASS OF TRUTHS
AND THE GOVERNMENTS KNOW THIS AND FEAR SUCH INCIDENTS MORE THAN ALL THE SOCIALISTS COMMUNISTS AND ANARCHISTS AND THEIR PLOTS AND DYNAMITE BOMBS
CAPITALISTS EXPEND A PART OF THEIR CAPITAL ON EDUCATIONAL ARTISTIC PHILANTHROPIC AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS THEY HAVE LONG AGO ELABORATED METHODS ENCOURAGING TEMPERANCE WHICH CANNOT SUPPRESS DRUNKENNESS
CONTRADICTION BETWEEN OUR LIFE AND OUR CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE
ONLY LET US ACCEPT AND BOLDLY PROFESS THE TRUTH TO WHICH WE ARE CALLED AND WE SHOULD FIND AT ONCE THAT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF MEN ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE THAT THEY SEE THE TRUTH AS WE DO AND DREAD AS WE DO TO STAND ALONE IN RECOGNIZING IT AND LIKE US ARE ONLY WAITING FOR OTHERS TO RECOGNIZE IT ALSO
WHY DO THEY FALL WITH SUCH FURY ON ANY EFFORT AT BREAKING DOWN RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITIONS OR REALLY ENLIGHTENING THE PEOPLE
IT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN THE EXACT SENSE OF OUR SAVIOUR'S TEACHING--THAT IS NOT REPAYING EVIL FOR EVIL
HERE ARE PIOTR AND VANIA AND MAKAR TRYING NOT TO LOOK THEIR DEAR ONES IN THE FACE
BUT SUCH HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE
AND THIRDLY WITHOUT THE STATE TO DEFEND US WE SHOULD BE LIABLE TO BE CONQUERED AND ENSLAVED BY NEIGHBORING PEOPLES EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL-DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY BUT WHO ARE THESE EVIL-DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR MIDST FROM WHOSE ATTACKS WE ARE PRESERVED BY THE STATE AND ITS ARMY
WHY DO EVEN HIGH-PRINCIPLED PARENTS SEND THEIR BOYS TO MILITARY SCHOOLS
THEN IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIM THAT ON HOLIDAYS HOLIDAYS ARE THE DAYS ON WHICH CHRIST WAS BORN THOUGH NO ONE KNOWS WHEN THAT WAS ON WHICH HE WAS CIRCUMCISED ON WHICH THE MOTHER OF GOD DIED ON WHICH THE CROSS WAS CARRIED IN PROCESSION ON WHICH IKONS HAVE BEEN SET UP ON WHICH A LUNATIC SAW A VISION AND SO ON)--ON HOLIDAYS HE MUST DRESS HIMSELF IN HIS BEST CLOTHES AND GO TO CHURCH AND MUST BUY CANDLES AND PLACE THEM THERE BEFORE THE IMAGES OF THE SAINTS
WE EVEN ORGANIZE LEGALIZED PROSTITUTION
IN THE THIRD THEORY OF LIFE A MAN'S LIFE IS LIMITED NOT TO SOCIETIES AND CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS BUT EXTENDS TO THE PRINCIPLE AND SOURCE OF LIFE--TO GOD
YET THESE FORMS OF VIOLENCE CONTINUE AND ARE SUPPORTED BY THE VERY PEOPLE WHO SEE THEIR USELESSNESS INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY AND SUFFER FROM THEM
THE FULFILLMENT OF CHRIST'S TEACHING CONSISTS IN MOVING AWAY FROM SELF TOWARD GOD
ALL THESE PHENOMENA MIGHT SEEM TO BE MERE EXCEPTIONS EXCEPT THAT THEY CAN ALL BE REFERRED TO ONE COMMON CAUSE
WE KNOW NOTHING OF HUMANITY AS AN ETERNAL OBJECT AND WE KNOW NOTHING OF ITS LIMITS
YET EVERY MAN OF OUR DAY SEES THAT THIS IS SO AND AWAITS THE CALAMITY
IT IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED THAT GOVERNMENTS STRENGTHEN THEIR FORCES ONLY TO DEFEND THE STATE FROM OTHER STATES IN OBLIVION OF THE FACT THAT ARMIES ARE NECESSARY BEFORE ALL THINGS FOR THE DEFENSE OF GOVERNMENTS FROM THEIR OWN OPPRESSED AND ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
OR ON THE OTHER HAND FOR REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH AND SO BEING A MISERABLE AND RELUCTANT SLAVE DRAGGED WHITHER HE HAS NO DESIRE TO GO
COME NOW SUPPOSE YOUR FATHER WERE ARRESTED AND TRIED TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE I ASKED A YOUNG SOLDIER
AS EXAMPLES OF THESE QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE ANSWERS ARE TO SOME EXTENT INCLUDED ALSO I WILL QUOTE THE FOLLOWING
WE KNOW IT AND TREMBLE WITH RAGE BUT WE CAN DO NOTHING
BEHOLD THE FOULS OF THE AIR
TO RESIST SUCH EVIL AND TO PREVENT IT THE EVIL DOER MUST BE PUNISHED WITH DEATH OR MAIMING OR SOME PHYSICAL INJURY
ALL THIS HE KNOWS AND HE CANNOT BUT SUFFER KEENLY FROM THE SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT IS AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE
THEY ARE TROUBLED BY THE QUESTION HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT THOSE HABITUAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE WHICH WE CALL CIVILIZATION CULTURE ART AND SCIENCE
BUT STILL CANNONS AND GUNS WILL NOT FIRE THEMSELVES PRISONS WILL NOT SHUT MEN UP OF THEMSELVES GALLOWS WILL NOT HANG THEM CHURCHES WILL NOT DELUDE THEM NOR CUSTOMS OFFICES HINDER THEM AND PALACES AND FACTORIES ARE NOT BUILT NOR KEPT UP OF THEMSELVES
AND IF HE CANNOT ANSWER THEN HE WOULD DO BETTER NO TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT AT ALL AS SUCH SILENCE LEADS TO ERROR THE MAJORITY OF RELIGIOUS CRITICS OF MY BOOK USE THIS FIFTH METHOD OF REPLYING TO IT
THE PERVERSION OF CHRIST'S TEACHING BY THE TEACHING OF THE CHURCH IS MORE CLEARLY APPARENT IN THIS THAN IN ANY OTHER POINT OF DIFFERENCE
TO EXTERMINATE SUCH NATIONS AND SUCH CRIMINALS BY VIOLENCE IS POSSIBLE AND INDEED IS DONE BUT TO SUBDUE THEM IS IMPOSSIBLE
FROM THE END OF LAST CENTURY THERE HAS HARDLY BEEN A SINGLE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RETARDED BY THE GOVERNMENT
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR THE MEN OF THE ANCIENT WORLD TO OBSERVE THEIR LAWS
THOSE WHO HAVE SEIZED POWER AUD WHO KEEP IT WAS CHANGED TO
HAD THIS CONSCIOUSNESS BEEN STILL STRONGER AND HAD THE INFLUENCE EXERTED BEEN THEREFORE GREATER THAN IT WAS IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THAT THE GOVERNOR WITH HIS TROOPS WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE VENTURED TO CUT DOWN THE FOREST AND GIVE IT TO THE LANDOWNER
FOR INDEED HOW COULD THE NOTION OCCUR TO ANY ONE THAT ALL THAT HAS BEEN REPEATED FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY WITH SUCH EARNESTNESS AND SOLEMNITY BY ALL THOSE ARCHDEACONS BISHOPS ARCHBISHOPS HOLY SYNODS AND POPES IS ALL OF IT A BASE LIE AND A CALUMNY FOISTED UPON CHRIST BY THEM FOR THE SAKE OF KEEPING SAFE THE MONEY THEY MUST HAVE TO LIVE LUXURIOUSLY ON THE NECKS OF OTHER MEN
IT SEEMS JUST AS THOUGH IT DID NOT EXIST AND NEVER HAD EXISTED
BUT IT IS NOT THAT REMOTE PERIL WHICH FRIGHTENS ME
THE SAME IMPRESSION WAS PRODUCED BY THE WELL-DRESSED FUNCTIONARIES AND OFFICERS WHO WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLATFORM AND IN THE FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE
THE PROUD AND PHARISAICAL THE AMBITIOUS AND TYRANNICAL PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS MAY COMBINE TO CRUSH US
WITHOUT THE CONVICTION THAT THERE IS A PERSON OR PERSONS WHO WILL TAKE THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS ACTS NOT ONE SOLDIER WOULD EVER LIFT A HAND TO COMMIT A MURDER OR OTHER DEED OF VIOLENCE
ALL MEN WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN AUTHORITY ASSERT THAT THEIR AUTHORITY IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE BAD FROM OPPRESSING THE GOOD ASSUMING THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE THE GOOD PAR EXCELLENCE WHO PROTECT OTHER GOOD PEOPLE FROM THE BAD
A GREAT GENIUS ANSWERED THAT LONG AGO IN THE WORDS THAT HAVE BECOME A PROVERB
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUSSIA AND POLAND BETWEEN ENGLAND AND IRELAND BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND BOHEMIA BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE SLAVONIC STATES BETWEEN FRANCE AND GERMANY TO BE SOOTHED AWAY BY AMIABLE CONCILIATION
THE NECESSITY OF EXTENDING THE SPHERE OF LOVE IS BEYOND DISPUTE
SO WHY SHOULD I DO THIS
IN THE YEAR 1885 THERE WERE 130 SUCH CASES
THIS MEANS WAS EMPLOYED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES ESPECIALLY BY THOSE WHO HAD GAINED POSSESSION OF AUTHORITY AND FOR A LONG WHILE ITS IRRATIONALITY WAS NOT DETECTED
BUT I HAD NEVER BEFORE HAPPENED TO SEE MEN IN THE PROCESS OF CARRYING OUT THESE PUNISHMENTS
BECAUSE THE ONE AIM OF YOUR LIFE OUGHT TO BE TO PURIFY YOURSELF FROM FALSEHOOD AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
IN THIS WAY THEN THE DISCUSSIONS OF MY BOOK ON THE PART OF CHURCHMEN AND FREETHINKING CRITICS ALIKE SHOWED ME THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEN SIMPLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER CHRIST'S TEACHING OR THE QUESTIONS WHICH CHRIST'S TEACHING SOLVES
EVERYTHING IS READY FOR THE NEW LIFE BUT STILL THE NEW LIFE DOES NOT COME
THE CONDITIONS OF THE NEW ORDER OF LIFE CANNOT BE KNOWN BY US BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CREATE THEM BY OUR OWN LABORS
BY PRECISELY THE SAME MEANS I
SOME WILL WANT BEATING TO MAKE THEM MOVE OTHERS WILL BE PROUD TO GO IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO WEAR A SCRAP OF RIBBON OR GOLD LACE
MONETA
THE CONGRESS CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF DISARMAMENT AS OF PEACE IN GENERAL DEPENDS ON PUBLIC OPINION RECOMMENDS THE PEACE SOCIETIES AS WELL AS ALL FRIENDS OF PEACE TO BE ACTIVE IN ITS PROPAGANDA ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN ORDER THAT THE ELECTORS SHOULD GIVE THEIR VOTES TO CANDIDATES WHO ARE PLEDGED TO SUPPORT PEACE DISARMAMENT AND ARBITRATION
THE ROBBER THE MURDERER AND THE CHEAT WILL LEAVE THEM IN PEACE SOONER THAN THOSE WHO OPPOSE THEM WITH ARMS AND THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE SWORD SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD BUT THOSE WHO SEEK AFTER PEACE AND BEHAVE KINDLY AND HARMLESSLY FORGIVING AND FORGETTING INJURIES FOR THE MOST PART ENJOY PEACE OR IF THEY DIE THEY DIE BLESSED
THE CHURCH IS A SOCIETY FOUNDED UPON EARTH BY JESUS CHRIST WHICH IS UNITED INTO ONE WHOLE BY ONE DIVINE DOCTRINE AND BY SACRAMENTS UNDER THE RULE AND GUIDANCE OF A PRIESTHOOD APPOINTED BY GOD MEANING BY THE PRIESTHOOD APPOINTED BY GOD THE GREEK ORTHODOX PRIESTHOOD CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN SUCH OR SUCH POSITIONS
CHRIST'S TEACHING IS USELESS BECAUSE IF IT WERE CARRIED INTO PRACTICE LIFE COULD NOT GO ON AS AT PRESENT
MATT
MATT
HE IS ALL RIGHT YES REVEREND FATHER ADMINISTER THE OATH TO HIM NO ONE IS THE LEAST DISTURBED BY WHAT THE POOR SCARED YOUNG MAN IS MUTTERING
THE SOLITARY PRISON CELLS THE EXPERIMENTS OF EXECUTION BY ELECTRICITY--AND THE CARE OF THE HYGIENIC WELFARE OF PRISONERS
AND THEREFORE MAN THOUGH NOT FREE IN HIS ACTS ALWAYS FEELS HIMSELF FREE IN WHAT IS THE MOTIVE OF HIS ACTS--THE RECOGNITION OR NON-RECOGNITION OF TRUTH
I NOTICED THE SAME THING IN THE SOLDIERS
IN RATIO TO THE DURATION AND INCREASING STRENGTH OF AUTHORITY ITS ADVANTAGES FOR ITS SUBJECTS DISAPPEAR AND ITS DISADVANTAGES INCREASE
TO REJECT THE USE OF FORCE AND TRUST TO PUBLIC OPINION TO DEFEND US WOULD BE AS INSANE AS TO REMOVE ALL WEAPONS OF DEFENSE IN A MENAGERIE AND THEN TO LET LOOSE ALL THE LIONS AND TIGERS RELYING ON THE FACT THAT THE ANIMALS SEEMED PEACEABLE WHEN KEPT IN THEIR CAGES AND HELD IN CHECK BY RED-HOT IRONS
AND HIS RELIGION IS THE WORSHIP IN DEED AND IN TRUTH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE--GOD
THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE FIFTH AND MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF GETTING OUT OF THE CONTRADICTIONS IN WHICH CHURCH CHRISTIANITY HAS PLACED ITSELF BY PROFESSING ITS FAITH IN CHRIST'S TEACHING IN WORDS WHILE IT DENIES IT IN ITS LIFE AND TEACHES PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME
THE GREATER FISHES WHO BROKE THE NET ARE THE RULERS EMPERORS POPES KINGS WHO HAVE NOT RENOUNCED POWER AND INSTEAD OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY HAVE PUT ON WHAT IS SIMPLY A MASK OF IT HELCHITSKY TEACHES PRECISELY WHAT HAS BEEN AND IS TAUGHT IN THESE DAYS BY THE NON-RESISTANT MENNONITES AND QUAKERS AND IN FORMER TUNES BY THE BOGOMILITES PAULICIANS AND MANY OTHERS
IN DECLARING THAT IF THEIR AUTHORITY DID NOT EXIST THE MORE WICKED WOULD OPPRESS THE GOOD THE RULING AUTHORITIES ONLY SHOW THEIR DISINCLINATION TO LET OTHER OPPRESSORS COME TO POWER WHO WOULD LIKE TO SNATCH IT FROM THEM
AND AS THESE ORDERS FOR THE MOST PART INVOLVE MURDER IT FOLLOWS THAT HE OUGHT TO BREAK ALL THE LAWS OF GOD AND MAN
AND INDEED IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A POSITION MORE WRETCHED THAN THAT OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD TO-DAY WITH ITS NATIONS ARMED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER WITH ITS CONSTANTLY INCREASING TAXATION TO MAINTAIN ITS ARMIES WITH THE HATRED OF THE WORKING CLASS FOR THE RICH EVER GROWING MORE INTENSE WITH THE DAMOCLES SWORD OF WAR FOREVER HANGING OVER THE HEADS OF ALL READY EVERY INSTANT TO FALL CERTAIN TO FALL SOONER OR LATER
EVERY CHURCH TRACES ITS CREED THROUGH AN UNINTERRUPTED TRANSMISSION FROM CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES
WRONG MUST BE OPPOSED BY WRONG MURDER BY MURDER INJURY BY INJURY EVIL BY EVIL
WHAT IS TO BE DONE
CONSEQUENTLY THERE ARE EVERY YEAR AMONG US IN RUSSIA SOME MEN CALLED UPON FOR MILITARY SERVICE WHO REFUSE TO SERVE ON THE GROUND OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
THE SELFISH WHO MAKE USE OF THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE ARE REGARDED AS THE WORST OF MEN
THAT IS IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THE CORRECTNESS OF WHAT THEY HAD DECIDED WAS GUARANTEED BY THE MIRACULOUS PARTICIPATION OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT IS OF GOD IN THEIR DECISION
AND SO ALL THESE PEOPLE FEEL NO UNEASINESS AS TO WHO IS AT THE HEAD OF THE ORGANIZATION THEY WILL ADAPT THEMSELVES TO ANYONE
ONE CANNOT EXPECT TO TAKE ABSOLUTELY NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW AS IS SAID IN THE GOSPEL BUT ONLY NOT TO TAKE TOO MUCH THOUGHT FOR IT
IN THE SAME WAY THEY PRETEND TO SUPPORT TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES WHILE THEY ARE LIVING PRINCIPALLY ON THE DRUNKENNESS OF THE PEOPLE
THAT IF KILLING IS A CRIME KILLING MANY CAN BE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE
AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS HE BELIEVE HIM COMMEND HIM AND SOLEMNLY DISCUSS WITH HIM MEASURES FOR AMELIORATING THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING-CLASS ON WHOSE EXPLOITATION THEIR WHOLE LIFE RESTS DEVISING ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLE METHODS FOR THIS EXCEPT THE ONE WITHOUT WHICH ALL IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR CONDITION IS IMPOSSIBLE I
AND THIS TIME HAS NOW COME
BUT IN ALL THE CRITICISMS OF MY BOOK THERE WAS NO SUCH PLAIN AND DIRECT ANSWER
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD AND SO IT IS STILL
AND WHEN THE GOSPEL IS INFLUENCING EVERY SIDE OF HUMAN LIFE--DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CIVIC LEGISLATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL
THEN THE CROWD USUALLY RUNS AWAY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE TROOPS AT THE GOVERNOR'S COMMAND TAKE THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE RINGLEADERS AND LEAD THEM OFF UNDER ESCORT
NOT ONLY IS THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL NOT DISCUSSED
AND MEN OF THIS WAY OF THINKING ALSO BRING FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF THEIR VIEWS ARGUMENTS WHICH THEY THINK IRREFUTABLE FROM PHILOSOPHY HISTORY AND RELIGION
WHATEVER THE OPINIONS AND DEGREE OF EDUCATION OF A MAN OF TO-DAY WHATEVER HIS SHADE OF LIBERALISM WHATEVER HIS SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY OR OF SCIENCE OR OF ECONOMICS HOWEVER IGNORANT OR SUPERSTITIOUS HE MAY BE EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY KNOWS THAT ALL MEN HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT TO LIFE AND THE GOOD THINGS OF LIFE AND THAT ONE SET OF PEOPLE ARE NO BETTER NOR WORSE THAN ANOTHER THAT ALL ARE EQUAL
TO LOVE ONE'S CLAN WHO SUPPORT AND PROTECT ONE TO LOVE ONE'S WIFE THE JOY AND HELP OF ONE'S EXISTENCE ONE'S CHILDREN THE HOPE AND CONSOLATION OF ONE'S LIFE AND ONE'S PARENTS WHO HAVE GIVEN ONE LIFE AND EDUCATION IS NATURAL
ARMIES THEN ARE NEEDED BY GOVERNMENTS AND BY THE RULING CLASSES ABOVE ALL TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT ORDER WHICH FAR FROM BEING THE RESULT OF THE PEOPLE'S NEEDS IS OFTEN IN DIRECT ANTAGONISM TO THEM AND IS ONLY BENEFICIAL TO THE GOVERNMENT AND RULING CLASSES
ONE DAY BY A MAD KING OF BAVARIA ANOTHER BY WILLIAM
I HAD ANTICIPATED THAT FREETHINKING WRITERS WOULD LOOK AT CHRIST NOT MERELY LIKE THE CHURCHMEN AS THE FOUNDER OF A RELIGION OF PERSONAL SALVATION BUT TO EXPRESS IT IN THEIR LANGUAGE AS A REFORMER WHO LAID DOWN NEW PRINCIPLES OF LIFE AND DESTROYED THE OLD AND WHOSE REFORMS ARE NOT YET COMPLETE BUT ARE STILL IN PROGRESS EVEN NOW
YOU WOULD DO BETTER YOUNG MAN TO GET OFF YOUR HORSE AND LISTEN
HOW OUGHT A MAN AS A CHRISTIAN TO MEET THIS DEMAND
BE PURE
ALL THIS HAS BEEN REPEATED IN FOUR CASES THE DOCTORS LET HIM OUT OF THE MADHOUSE AND THEN EVERY KIND OF SECRET SHIFT IS EMPLOYED TO PREVENT HIM FROM GOING FREE--WHEREBY OTHERS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO REFUSE TO SERVE AS HE HAS DONE--AND AT THE SAME TIME TO AVOID LEAVING HIM AMONG THE SOLDIERS FOR FEAR THEY TOO SHOULD LEARN FROM HIM THAT MILITARY SERVICE IS NOT AT ALL THEIR DUTY BY THE LAW OF GOD AS THEY ARE ASSURED BUT QUITE CONTRARY TO IT
INSTEAD OF THE THREATS OF PUNISHMENT WHICH ALL THE OLD LAWS OF RELIGIONS AND GOVERNMENTS ALIKE LAID DOWN FOR NON-FULFILLMENT OF THEIR RULES INSTEAD OF PROMISES OF REWARDS FOR FULFILLMENT OF THEM THIS DOCTRINE CALLED MEN TO IT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUTH
IF ANOTHER BOY STRIKES YOU YOU MUSTN'T HIT HIM BACK BUT TRY TO REFORM HIM BY LOVING HIM WELL
MAN CANNOT CHANGE HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE IS NOT FREE
THE MORE TELEGRAPHS TELEPHONES BOOKS PAPERS AND JOURNALS THERE ARE
THE EMPEROR DOES THE SAME HIMSELF
THEY CAN BE FORMED INTO NOTHING BUT A HERD OF CATTLE DRIVEN BY THE SHOUTS AND WHIPS OF THE HERDSMEN
A HORSE HARNESSED WITH OTHERS TO A CART IS NOT FREE TO REFRAIN FROM MOVING THE CART
AND THE CHURCHES HAVE NEVER SERVED AS MEDIATORS BETWEEN MEN AND GOD
VOLUMES MAY BE WRITTEN IN DEFENSE OF THE FORMER VIEW AND VOLUMES INDEED HAVE LONG AGO BEEN WRITTEN AND MORE WILL STILL BE WRITTEN ON THAT SIDE BUT MUCH ALSO CAN BE WRITTEN AGAINST IT AND MUCH ALSO AND MOST BRILLIANTLY HAS BEEN WRITTEN--THOUGH MORE RECENTLY ON THIS SIDE AND IT CANNOT BE PROVED AS THE CHAMPIONS OF THE STATE MAINTAIN THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVES A SOCIAL CHAOS MUTUAL SPOLIATION AND MURDER THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE RETURN OF MANKIND TO BARBARISM
TO KILL THEM OR KEEP THEM IN PERPETUAL IMPRISONMENT IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE
TAKE THOUGHT AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS NOT REAL LIFE--THE LIFE OF THE FAMILY OF SOCIETY OF THE STATE WILL NOT SAVE YOU FROM ANNIHILATION
WE CANNOT SERVE THESE TWO MASTERS
AND THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT BEHAVES NOW EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE GERMAN MENNONITES LIVING IN THE PROVINCE OF KHERSON WHOSE PLEA AGAINST MILITARY SERVICE IS CONSIDERED WELL GROUNDED
BY THIS METHOD THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE IS COMPLETED
MORE THAN THIS ALL THE SAVAGE AND ABSOLUTELY NON-CHRISTIAN PEOPLES WHO ARE SO NUMEROUS OUTSIDE THE CHRISTIAN WORLD MUST ALSO BE CONVERTED
ONE WORD AS TO THE TRANSLATION
WE ARE GUIDED IN ECONOMICAL POLITICAL AND INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS BY THE PRINCIPLES WHICH WERE APPROPRIATE TO MEN OF THREE OR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO THOUGH THEY ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO OUR CONSCIENCE AND THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE IN WHICH WE ARE PLACED TO-DAY
ARBITRATION SHALL REPLACE WAR
WHEN FOR INSTANCE IT IS SUGGESTED TO THE HYPNOTIZED SUBJECT THAT HE IS LAME HE BEGINS TO WALK LAME THAT HE IS BLIND AND HE CANNOT SEE THAT HE IS A WILD BEAST AND HE BEGINS TO BITE
STILL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THIS BUSY THEMSELVES OVER PEACE CONGRESSES READ ADDRESSES AND WRITE BOOKS
WHO HAS LED THEM INTO THIS AMAZING DELUSION
THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE NOW MY SOLDIERS THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELVES TO ME BODY AND SOUL
I KNOW THAT I DO NOT NEED ALL THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ORGANIZED WITHIN THE STATE AND THEREFORE I CANNOT DEPRIVE PEOPLE WHO NEED MY LABOR TO GIVE IT IN THE FORM OF TAXES TO INSTITUTIONS WHICH I DO NOT NEED WHICH FOR ALL I KNOW MAY BE PERNICIOUS
TOLSTOY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A COARSE DECEIT HAD BEEN PALMED UPON THE WORLD WHEN THESE WORDS RESIST NOT EVIL WERE HELD BY CIVIL SOCIETY TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH WAR COURTS OF JUSTICE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT DIVORCE OATHS NATIONAL PREJUDICE AND INDEED WITH MOST OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL AND SOCIAL LIFE
OTHERS CROWDED NEAR THE DOOR ARE QUIETLY AND MOURNFULLY WAITING THEIR TURN BETWEEN THEIR WEEPING WIVES AND MOTHERS I HAD CHANCED UPON THE DAY OF THE ACTUAL ENROLLING THAT IS THE EXAMINATION OF THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE ON THE LIST
IN THE SAME WAY TOO IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN RESTRAINT THE MALEFACTORS FOR WHOM THE PRISONS AND GALLOWS ARE ESTABLISHED
THE FIRST AND CRUDEST FORM OF REPLY CONSISTS IN THE BOLD ASSERTION THAT THE USE OF FORCE IS NOT OPPOSED BY THE TEACHING OF CHRIST
TO BRING UNDER THE SWAY OF CHRISTIANITY SAVAGE NATIONS WHO DO NOT ATTACK US AND WHOM WE HAVE THEREFORE NO EXCUSE FOR OPPRESSING WE OUGHT BEFORE ALL THINGS TO LEAVE THEM IN PEACE AND IN CASE WE NEED OR WISH TO ENTER INTO CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THEM WE OUGHT ONLY TO INFLUENCE THEM BY CHRISTIAN MANNERS AND CHRISTIAN TEACHING SETTING THEM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES OF PATIENCE MEEKNESS ENDURANCE PURITY BROTHERHOOD AND LOVE
MEN IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION ARE LIKE A SWARM OF BEES HANGING IN A CLUSTER TO A BRANCH
FIRE!--ALL THE LINE!--FIRE AND SO ON THEIR GUNS WILL RISE OF THEMSELVES AND THE HABITUAL MOVEMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED
FOR THEY SHARE THE ERRONEOUS IDEA OF THE ORTHODOX BELIEVERS THAT THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF CERTAIN INFALLIBLE MEANS FOR INVESTIGATING A SUBJECT
THIS FREEDOM WITHIN THESE NARROW LIMITS SEEMS SO INSIGNIFICANT TO MEN THAT THEY DO NOT NOTICE IT
THIS QUESTION IS I THINK A MOST VITAL ONE AND THE ANSWER TO IT IS SPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN THESE DAYS OF UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION
BUT THE DEATH OR THE WOUNDING OF THE RUFFIAN HAS POSITIVELY TAKEN PLACE WHILE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS HAD NOT BEEN I CANNOT KNOW
AND SUCH DEFINITIONS OF EVIL SOMETIMES TOOK THE FORM OF LAWS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS SOMETIMES OF THE COMMANDS OF RULERS OR ASSEMBLIES TO WHOM INFALLIBILITY WAS ATTRIBUTED
ALL THE OTHER STATES
ALPHA(FOLLOWED BY AN APOSTROPHE)-IOTA(WITH ACCENT RHO-EPSILON-SIGMA-IOTA-ZETA THERE IS A REMARKABLE AND VOLUMINOUS WORK VERY LITTLE KNOWN UNPARTHEYISCHE KIRCHEN UND KETZER-HISTORIE 1729 BY GOTTFRIED ARNOLD WHICH DEALS WITH PRECISELY THIS SUBJECT AND POINTS OUT ALL THE UNLAWFULNESS THE ARBITRARINESS THE SENSELESSNESS AND THE CRUELTY OF USING THE WORD HERETIC IN THE SENSE OF REPROBATE
THE MORE MEN ARE FREED FROM PRIVATION
HIS LAW REVEALED BY CHRIST HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF AND VOLUNTARILY OBEYS IT
AND AGAIN NOTHING CAN BE DONE
AND IF WE SEE THAT THEIR FRUITS WERE EVIL THAT THE RESULTS OF THEIR ACTIVITY WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY WE CANNOT BUT ADMIT THAT HOWEVER GOOD THE MEN WERE--THE WORK OF THE CHURCH IN WHICH THESE MEN TOOK PART WAS NOT CHRISTIAN
IT WAS THUS FROM THE VERY EARLIEST TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY
THE FORMATION AND AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE ARMY INDISPENSABLE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF AUTHORITY IS WHAT HAS INTRODUCED INTO THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE THE PRINCIPLE THAT IS DESTROYING IT
THERE MAY BE CASES OF OPPRESSION OF VIOLENCE AND OF PUNISHMENTS THOUGH THEY ARE RARE THE AIM OF WHICH IS NOT TO SECURE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE SENSE OF THE USELESSNESS AND EVEN INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF STATE VIOLENCE IS MORE AND MORE PENETRATING INTO MEN'S CONSCIOUSNESS THINGS MIGHT HAVE GONE ON IN THE SAME WAY FOREVER IF GOVERNMENTS WERE NOT UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR ARMIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR POWER
SUCH IS THE PROCESS BY MEANS OF WHICH CHRISTIANITY IN SPITE OF THE HINDRANCES TO HUMAN PROGRESS RESULTING FROM THE VIOLENCE OF POWER GAINS MORE AND MORE HOLD OF MEN
ONE OFTEN WONDERS WHY A FASHIONABLE LADY OR AN ARTIST WHO ONE WOULD THINK WOULD TAKE NO INTEREST IN POLITICAL OR MILITARY QUESTIONS SHOULD ALWAYS CONDEMN STRIKES OF WORKING PEOPLE AND DEFEND WAR
AND THIS BELIEF IN SOMETHING INDEFINITE AT ANY PLACE AT SOME TIME CANNOT BE A CRITERION OF TRUTH
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE APPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE HEATHEN ROMAN WORLD A STRANGE NEW DOCTRINE UNLIKE ANY OF THE OLD RELIGIONS AND ATTRIBUTED TO A MAN CHRIST
TO MAKE THIS LAW PLAIN HELCHITSKY POINTS TO THE PRIMITIVE ORGANIZATION OF CHRISTIAN SOCIETY--THE ORGANIZATION WHICH HE SAYS IS NOW REGARDED IN THE ROMAN CHURCH AS AN ABOMINABLE HERESY
HUMANITY IS A FICTION AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE IT
THEY PRETEND EITHER THAT NO SUCH QUESTION EXISTS AT ALL OR THAT THE QUESTION IS SOLVED BY GRANTING TO CERTAIN PERSONS OR ASSEMBLIES OF PERSONS THE RIGHT TO DEFINE EVIL AND TO RESIST IT BY FORCE
THE IDEA IS PROMULGATED THAT MEN OUGHT NOT TO WALK ON THEIR OWN LEGS WHERE THEY WANT AND OUGHT TO GO BUT THAT A KIND OF FLOOR UNDER THEIR FEET WILL BE MOVED SOMEHOW SO THAT ON IT THEY CAN REACH WHERE THEY OUGHT TO GO WITHOUT MOVING THEIR OWN LEGS
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT EACH SOLDIER WILL DO AT THE LAST MINUTE
IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE INSANITY OF SOVEREIGNS HAS GAINED POSSESSION OF THE RULING CLASSES
WHAT SORT OF MORAL AND RATIONAL SOCIETY CAN BE FORMED OUT OF SUCH ELEMENTS
BUT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH PUBLIC OPINION IS LEADING MEN TO THE ABOLITION OF THE PREVAILING ORDER AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF A NEW ORDER
THE FOREIGN FREETHINKING CRITICS HAVE TRIED IN A DELICATE MANNER WITHOUT BEING OFFENSIVE TO ME TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT MY CONVICTION THAT MANKIND COULD BE GUIDED BY SUCH A NAIVE DOCTRINE AS THAT OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT PROCEEDS FROM TWO CAUSES
HE SAYS THAT THE PROHIBITION OF RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE MEANS EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES MEAN
SCIENTIFIC MEN TEACH IN THEORY THAT THE ONLY GOOD AND RATIONAL LIFE IS THAT WHICH IS DEVOTED TO THE SERVICE OF THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY
HERE THEY ARE--ONE WITH HIS SCANTY BEARD AND PATCHED COAT AND PLAITED SHOES OF REED JUST LIKE THE FATHER LEFT AT HOME IN KAZAN OR RIAZAN PROVINCE
MEN OF THE POORER CLASS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS WHO WILL HAVE TO EXECUTE THE DEED OF VIOLENCE WITH THEIR OWN HANDS SAY THAT THEY DO SO BECAUSE IT IS THE COMMAND OF THEIR SUPERIOR AUTHORITY AND THE SUPERIOR AUTHORITY KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT
THE SOCIALISTS THE COMMUNISTS THE ANARCHISTS WITH THEIR BOMBS AND RIOTS AND REVOLUTIONS ARE NOT NEARLY SO MUCH DREADED BY GOVERNMENTS AS THESE DISCONNECTED INDIVIDUALS COMING FROM DIFFERENT PARTS AND ALL JUSTIFYING THEIR NON-COMPLIANCE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE SAME RELIGION WHICH IS KNOWN TO ALL THE WORLD
THIS IS WHAT HE WRITES IN AN ARTICLE ON THE MILITARY SECTION OF THE EXHIBITION OF 1889
BUT NOT SO WITH THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE
WHAT IMPORTANCE ONE MIGHT THINK CAN ONE ATTACH TO SUCH AN INCIDENT AS SOME DOZENS OF CRAZY FELLOWS AS PEOPLE WILL CALL THEM REFUSING TO TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT REFUSING TO PAY TAXES TO TAKE PART IN LAW PROCEEDINGS OR IN MILITARY SERVICE
THUS THEY REFUSE THE VOLUNTARY PAYMENT OF TAXES BECAUSE TAXES ARE SPENT ON DEEDS OF VIOLENCE--ON THE PAY OF MEN OF VIOLENCE--SOLDIERS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF PRISONS FORTRESSES AND CANNONS
HE CANNOT TAKE ANY PART IN WAR OR IN PREPARATIONS FOR WAR
THE FIRST EXAMPLE IN THE BOOK OF ACTS IS THE ASSEMBLY WHICH GATHERED TOGETHER IN JERUSALEM TO DECIDE THE QUESTION WHICH HAD ARISEN WHETHER TO BAPTIZE OR NOT THE UNCIRCUMCISED AND THOSE WHO HAD EATEN OF FOOD SACRIFICED TO IDOLS
AND THIS FATHER WHO HAS BEEN PERSUADED THAT HE IS SPECIALLY AND EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO THE SERVICE OF CHRIST AND WHO FOR THE MOST PART DOES NOT HIMSELF SEE THE DECEPTION IN WHICH HE LIVES GOES INTO THE HALL WHERE THE CONSCRIPTS ARE WAITING
NEVERTHELESS JUST AS A MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN CANNOT CONTINUE TO LOOK AT LIFE AS HE LOOKED AT IT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD SO TOO IN THE FACE OF THE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THE GREATER DENSITY OF POPULATION THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PEOPLES THE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE METHODS OF THE STRUGGLE WITH NATURE AND THE ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE HUMANITY CANNOT CONTINUE TO LOOK AT LIFE AS OF OLD AND IT MUST FRAME A NEW THEORY OF LIFE FROM WHICH CONDUCT MAY FOLLOW ADAPTED TO THE NEW CONDITIONS ON WHICH IT HAS ENTERED AND IS ENTERING
WE GIVE LAND TO THOSE WHO DO NOT NEED IT
ONE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT SO MUCH IS WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY SAY IN DISCUSSING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
AND THEY ARE QUESTIONED
THEY ALL TURN INTO THE TAVERNS WHOSE REVENUES GO TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DRINKING BOUT BEGINS WHICH STIFLES THEIR SENSE OF THE WRONG WHICH IS BEING DONE THEM
AND IT CONDEMNS EVERY KIND OF MANIFESTATION OF COVETOUSNESS NOT ONLY THE APPROPRIATION OF THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS BY FORCE OR FRAUD OR TRICKERY BUT EVEN THE CRUEL ABUSE OF WEALTH
THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF THE CULTIVATED MEN OF OUR DAY TRY UNCONSCIOUSLY TO MAINTAIN THE OLD SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH JUSTIFIES THEIR POSITION AND TO HIDE FROM THEMSELVES AND OTHERS ITS INSUFFICIENCY AND ABOVE ALL THE NECESSITY OF ADOPTING THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH WILL MEAN THE BREAK UP OF THE WHOLE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
HE IS PRONOUNCED INCORRIGIBLE AND SENT BACK AGAIN TO THE ARMY
OFTEN WHEN ONE SEES CONSCRIPTION LEVIES MILITARY DRILLS AND MANEUVERS POLICE OFFICERS WITH LOADED REVOLVERS AND SENTINELS AT THEIR POSTS WITH BAYONETS ON THEIR RIFLES
BY TURNING THE WHEELS BY HAND AND BY LEVERS THEY COULD ONLY PRODUCE A SEMBLANCE OF MOVEMENT AND MEANTIME THEY WOULD BE WRENCHING THE WHEELS AND SO PREVENTING THEIR BEING FIT FOR REAL MOVEMENT
DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE MUST INEVITABLY BE ACCEPTED BY MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY IX
THE AUTHORITY WHO GIVES THE ORDERS AND THE AUTHORITY WHO EXECUTES THEM AT THE TWO EXTREME ENDS OF THE STATE ORGANIZATION MEET TOGETHER LIKE THE TWO ENDS OF A RING
I AGAIN WENT INTO THE CROWD TOOK MY STAND AMONG THE PEASANTS LOOKED ABOUT AND ASKED QUESTIONS
12 IT IS THIS VIOLENT EFFORT TO RISE ABOVE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS TO THE RECOGNITION AND REALIZATION OF TRUTH BY WHICH THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS TAKEN AND IT IS THIS EFFORT OF VIOLENCE WHICH MUST AND CAN BE MADE IN OUR TIMES
EVERY CONFLICT ONLY STRENGTHENS THE MEANS OF OPPRESSION IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO HAPPEN AT A GIVEN MOMENT TO BE IN POWER
PEOPLE ARE UNWILLING TO BE TURNED OUT OF THE LAND THEY HAVE CULTIVATED FOR GENERATIONS OR THEY ARE UNWILLING TO DISPERSE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY ORDERS THEM OR THEY ARE UNWILLING TO PAY THE TAXES REQUIRED OF THEM OR TO RECOGNIZE LAWS AS BINDING ON THEM WHEN THEY HAVE HAD NO HAND IN MAKING THEM OR TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR NATIONALITY--AND I IN THE FULFILLMENT OF MY MILITARY DUTY MUST GO AND SHOOT THEM FOR IT
THIS INDEPENDENCE RESULTS FIRST FROM THE CHRISTIAN RECOGNIZING THE LAW OF LOVE REVEALED TO HIM BY HIS TEACHER AS PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ALL HUMAN RELATIONS AND THEREFORE HE REGARDS EVERY USE OF FORCE AS UNNECESSARY AND UNLAWFUL
TO REGARD THIS COMMAND AS THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF CHRISTIAN LIFE AS GARRISON BALLOU DYMOND THE QUAKERS THE MENNONITES AND THE SHAKERS DO NOW AND AS THE MORAVIAN BROTHERS THE WALDENSES THE ALBIGENSES THE BOGOMILITES AND THE PAULICIANS DID IN THE PAST IS A ONE-SIDED HERESY
NOTHING
THE MAJORITY OF MEN ESPECIALLY ALL WHO WERE IN POWER EVEN AFTER THE NOMINAL ACCEPTANCE OF CHRISTIANITY CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN FOR THEMSELVES THE PRINCIPLE OF RESISTANCE BY FORCE TO WHAT THEY REGARDED AS EVIL
AND MOREOVER THAT LOVE MUST HAVE AN OBJECT AND THAT HUMANITY IS NOT AN OBJECT
AND THE MODIFICATION OF THESE CONDITIONS IS PARTLY EFFECTED BY SERVING THE GOVERNMENT AND INTRODUCING LIBERAL AND PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPLES INTO IT PARTLY IN PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY AND THE PROPAGATION OF SOCIALISTIC IDEAS AND MOST OF ALL BY THE DIFFUSION OF SCIENCE
THE FORMATION OF THIS PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE APPROPRIATE TO HUMANITY IN THE NEW CONDITIONS ON WHICH IT IS ENTERING AND OF THE PRACTICE RESULTING FROM IT IS WHAT IS CALLED RELIGION
IN THE SAME WAY ALL THESE MEN MAY COME TO THEMSELVES IN TIME OR THEY MAY GO ON TO THE END
THERE IS A LAW OF EVOLUTION BY WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT I MUST LIVE AND ACT IN AN EVIL WAY
AH WHY
THAT IT IS PERMITTED AND EVEN ENJOINED ON THE CHRISTIAN BY THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS
BUT HUMANITY CANNOT HAVE THIS AID BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS MOVING ALONG A HITHERTO UNTRODDEN TRACK AND HAS NO ONE TO ASK HOW TO UNDERSTAND LIFE AND TO ACT IN THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH IT IS ENTERING AND THROUGH WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER PASSED BEFORE
IT IS THE SAME WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER THE TIME HAS COME TO DO AWAY WITH THE GOVERNMENTAL TYPE OF SOCIETY AND TO REPLACE IT BY A NEW TYPE
YOU CAN ALWAYS AVOID LYING IN THIS WAY TO YOURSELF AND TO OTHERS AND YOU OUGHT TO DO SO
BUT NOW ALL MEN WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE SUBJECTED TO THIS TRIAL OF THEIR FAITH
THIS WAS PYPIN'S ACCOUNT
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE WHO ARE READING THESE LINES THINK OF YOUR POSITION AND OF YOUR DUTIES--NOT OF YOUR POSITION AS LANDOWNER MERCHANT JUDGE EMPEROR PRESIDENT MINISTER PRIEST SOLDIER WHICH HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY ALLOTTED YOU BY MEN AND NOT OF THE IMAGINARY DUTIES LAID ON YOU BY THOSE POSITIONS BUT OF YOUR REAL POSITIONS IN ETERNITY AS A CREATURE WHO AT THE WILL OF SOMEONE HAS BEEN CALLED OUT OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS AFTER AN ETERNITY OF NON-EXISTENCE TO WHICH YOU MAY RETURN AT ANY MOMENT AT HIS WILL
THE PRECEPT SHOWING THE LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CANNOT FALL IS NOT TO DO EVIL TO OUR ENEMIES TO SPEAK WELL OF THEM AND TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND OUR NEIGHBORS
QUELS SONT CEUX QUI SONT HORS DE L'EGLISE
TO BRING UNDER THE SWAY OF CHRISTIANITY ALL THE SAVAGE NATIONS OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD--ALL THE ZULUS MANDCHOOS AND CHINESE WHOM MANY REGARD AS SAVAGES--AND THE SAVAGES WHO LIVE IN OUR MIDST THERE IS ONLY ONE MEANS
IN THE SAME WAY A MAN WHO HAS MADE HIS ESCAPE ALONE FROM A HOUSE ON FIRE NOT HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO SAVE HIS FRIEND REMAINS FREE RECOGNIZING THE TRUTH THAT A MAN OUGHT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER EVEN AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN TO REGARD HIS ACTION AS BAD AND TO CENSURE HIMSELF FOR IT OR NOT RECOGNIZING THIS TRUTH TO REGARD HIS ACTION AS NATURAL AND NECESSARY AND TO JUSTIFY IT TO HIMSELF
WHEREIN LIES THE CHIEF SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE
ALL THE DETAILS OF THIS CASE AS WELL AS THOSE PRECEDING IT ARE AUTHENTIC THE SAME TREATMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED IN EVERY OTHER CASE
BUT ONLY LET EACH MAN ACCORDING TO HIS POWERS AT ONCE REALIZE IN HIS LIFE THE TRUTH HE KNOWS OR AT LEAST CEASE TO SUPPORT THE FALSEHOODS HE IS SUPPORTING IN THE PLACE OF THE TRUTH AND AT ONCE IN THIS YEAR 1893 WE SHOULD SEE SUCH REFORMS AS WE DO NOT DARE TO HOPE FOR WITHIN A CENTURY--THE EMANCIPATION OF MEN AND THE REIGN OF TRUTH UPON EARTH
BUT THE RISING CHRISTIAN IDEAL WHICH MUST AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT REPLACE THE HEATHEN IDEAL OF LIFE ALREADY MAKES ITS INFLUENCE FELT
TO-DAY FORCE IS CALLED VIOLENCE AND IS BEING BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT
THESE PEOPLE ARE PUNISHED AND EXILED TO A DISTANCE AND LIFE GOES ON IN ITS OLD WAY
OR WHAT SHALL WE DRINK
THE TRUE CHURCH WILL BE KNOWN BY THE WORD OF GOD BEING STUDIED CLEAR AND UNMIXED WITH MAN'S ADDITIONS AND THE SACRAMENTS BEING MAINTAINED FAITHFUL TO CHRIST'S TEACHING ACCORDING TO THIS DEFINITION ALL THOSE WHO HAVE ADDED ANYTHING TO THE TEACHING OF CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES AS THE CATHOLIC AND GREEK CHURCHES HAVE DONE ARE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH
IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE DESIRABLE IF THE WHOLE OF A NATION WERE CHRISTIANS BUT AMONG AND AROUND THEM WERE STILL UNCHRISTIAN MEN OF OTHER NATIONS
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A STATE AS A NATION
THE DOCTRINE OF AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH HAS BEEN ABROGATED BY CHRISTIANITY BECAUSE IT IS THE JUSTIFICATION OF IMMORALITY AND A MERE SEMBLANCE OF EQUITY AND HAS NO REAL MEANING
NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE
THE WITHDRAWING OF ALL MEN FROM THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE DESTROYS THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR ITSELF
THE PRODIGAL SON THE PIECE OF MONEY THAT WAS LOST AND FOUND AGAIN ARE DEARER MORE PRECIOUS TO GOD THAN THOSE WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN LOST
AND THEREFORE MEN ARE IN A THREEFOLD RELATION TO TRUTH
LES DIVERGENCES SECONDAIRES SE PRODUISENT EN ORIENT ET EN OCCIDENT AVEC UNE ENTIERE LIBERTE
BY THE ONE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS UNDERSTOOD THE ORTHODOX WHICH REMAINS FULLY IN ACCORD WITH THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH
AND THEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD WOULD BE REALIZED OR AT LEAST THAT FIRST STAGE OF IT FOR WHICH MEN ARE READY NOW BY THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CONSCIENCE
I OBTAINED THE PROOFS OF WHAT HAD BEEN PRINTED AND READ THEM THROUGH
DOES HUMANITY END WITH THE SAVAGE THE IDIOT THE DIPSOMANIAC OR THE MADMAN
IT IS THE SAME WITH THE CHANGES IN THE BELIEFS OF PEOPLES AND OF ALL HUMANITY AS IT IS WITH THE CHANGES OF BELIEF OF INDIVIDUALS
WHAT REMAINS TO US FROM GREECE
EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY IF WE GO DEEP ENOUGH INTO THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS LIFE IS IN A STATE OF DESPAIR
AGAIN THE AUTHORITIES DELIBERATE TOGETHER AND DECIDE TO ACCEPT HIM THOUGH HE HAS NOT TAKEN THE OATH AND TO ENROL HIM AMONG THE SOLDIERS
IN THE FIRST CASE EVEN IF HE DOES NOT AT ONCE GET OVER HIS PASSION HE GETS THE MORE FREE FROM IT THE MORE SINCERELY HE RECOGNIZES THE TRUTH ABOUT IT
ON THIS INEQUALITY ABOVE ALL ON THE ELEVATION OF SOME AND THE DEGRADATION OF OTHERS RESTS THE CAPACITY MEN HAVE OF BEING BLIND TO THE INSANITY OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF LIFE AND ALL THE CRUELTY AND CRIMINALITY OF THE DECEPTION PRACTICED BY ONE SET OF MEN ON ANOTHER
AND TO HIM CAME TWO TAILORS WHO PROMISED TO MAKE HIM SOME EXTRAORDINARY CLOTHES
AND THE RAIN DESCENDED AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND BEAT UPON THAT HOUSE
AND THE RAIN DESCENDED AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND BEAT UPON THAT HOUSE
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL-DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
IF STRIKES ON THE PART OF LABORERS ARE REPRESSESD WHILE ON THE PART OF CAPITALISTS THEY ARE ENCOURAGED
X
AND IT IS IN THE RECOGNITION OR NON-RECOGNITION OF THESE TRUTHS THAT WHAT WE CALL HIS FREEDOM IS MANIFESTED
ALL DEPENDS THEREFORE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRISTIAN TRUTH ON THE PART OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MAN
SO TOO HUMANITY LONG AFTER IT HAS LEARNT THROUGH ITS RELIGIONS THE NEW INTERESTS AND AIMS OF LIFE TOWARD WHICH IT MUST STRIVE CONTINUES IN THE MAJORITY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO LIVE AS BEFORE AND IS ONLY BROUGHT TO ACCEPT THE NEW CONCEPTION BY FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO ON LIVING ITS OLD LIFE AS BEFORE
18
QUE MESSIEURS LES ASSASSINS COMMENCENT PAR NOUS DONNER L'EXEMPLE OFTEN HAVE I HEARD THIS BON MOT REPEATED BY MEN WHO THOUGHT THAT THESE WORDS WERE A WITTY AND CONVINCING ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
BY UNBELIEVERS IT IS REGARDED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF MAN'S CRAVING FOR A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL WHICH MANKIND HAS NOW OUTGROWN AS AN HISTORICAL PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECEIVED FULL EXPRESSION IN CATHOLICISM GREEK ORTHODOXY AND PROTESTANTISM AND HAS NO LONGER ANY LIVING SIGNIFICANCE FOR US
LET THE CHURCH STOP ITS WORK OF HYPNOTIZING THE MASSES AND DECEIVING CHILDREN EVEN FOR THE BRIEFEST INTERVAL OF TIME AND MEN WOULD BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND CHRIST'S TEACHING

THE IMAGINATION REVOLTS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE WHICH IS COMING AT THE END OF OUR CENTURY AS THE GOAL OF THE PROGRESS OF OUR ERA AND YET WE MUST GET USED TO FACING IT
AND NOT ONLY INDIVIDUAL MEN BUT SOCIETIES OF MEN WHOLE NATIONS PASS THROUGH THIS PROCESS
IN THE GOSPELS THERE IS A WARNING AGAINST THE CHURCH AS IT IS AN EXTERNAL AUTHORITY A WARNING MOST CLEAR AND OBVIOUS IN THE PASSAGE WHERE IT IS SAID THAT CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS SHOULD CALL NO MAN MASTER BUT NOWHERE IS ANYTHING SAID OF THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT CHURCHMEN CALL THE CHURCH
WHAT DIDN'T YOU PAY THE TAX NO I DIDN'T PAY IT AND WHAT HAPPENED-NOTHING NOTHING THERE IS THE INSTITUTION OF PASSPORTS
FOR A MAN OF SENSE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF PEACE AND WAR
GOING INTO A COUNTRY CUTTING THE MAN'S THROAT WHO DEFENDS HIS HOUSE BECAUSE HE WEARS A BLOUSE AND HAS NOT A MILITARY CAP ON HIS HEAD BURNING THE DWELLINGS OF WRETCHED BEINGS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO EAT BREAKING FURNITURE AND STEALING GOODS DRINKING THE WINE FOUND IN THE CELLARS VIOLATING THE WOMEN IN THE STREETS BURNING THOUSANDS OF FRANCS WORTH OF POWDER AND LEAVING MISERY AND CHOLERA IN ONE'S TRACK THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY NOT FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM
THAT IS FOR THEM THE IMPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND TO THAT THEY REDUCE CHRIST'S TEACHING
ALL CITIZENS ARE OBLIGED TO TAKE A SHARE IN LAW PROCEEDINGS IN THE CHARACTER OF JURYMEN
TO SUGGEST TO GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO VIOLENCE BUT SHOULD DECIDE THEIR MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH EQUITY IS INVITING THEM TO ABOLISH THEMSELVES AS RULERS AND THAT NO GOVERNMENT CAN EVER CONSENT TO DO
AND THIS DECISION WAS TO ENABLE A YOUNG LANDOWNER WHO HAD AN INCOME OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO GAIN THREE THOUSAND RUBLES MORE BY STEALING A FOREST FROM A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF COLD AND FAMISHED PEASANTS TO SPEND IT IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS IN THE SALOONS OF MOSCOW PETERSBURG OR PARIS
THIS ORGANIZATION WE KNOW WILL WORK JUST AS WELL IN ONE MAN'S HANDS AS ANOTHER'S
THE ARGUMENTS OF ALL THE FREETHINKING CRITICS RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN ALIKE DIFFERENT AS THEY MAY BE IN TONE AND MANNER OF PRESENTATION ALL AMOUNT ESSENTIALLY TO THE SAME STRANGE MISAPPREHENSION--NAMELY THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH IS NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL IS OF NO USE TO US BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A CHANGE OF OUR LIFE
ANOTHER VILLAGE LAD LIKE HIMSELF BUT FROM A DISTANT PROVINCE NOW A SOLDIER ARMED WITH A GUN WITH A SHARP-POINTED BAYONET AT THE END KEEPS WATCH OVER HIM READY TO RUN HIM THROUGH THE BODY IF HE SHOULD THINK OF TRYING TO ESCAPE
THESE SEPARATE FIRES MAY BE FEW BUT THEY ARE BURNING WITH A FLAME WHICH HOWEVER SMALL A SPARK IT STARTS FROM NEVER CEASES TILL IT HAS SET THE WHOLE ABLAZE
AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE TABLE SAT THE GENERAL OF THE POLICE
BUT IT CAN NEVER BE FOR THE LOVE THAT IS BASED ON A PERSONAL OR SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CAN NEVER RISE BEYOND LOVE FOR THE STATE
IS IT NOT A CHRISTIAN DUTY TO KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ONE'S FELLOW-MEN TO OUTRAGE WOMEN TO RAZE AND BURN TOWNS AND TO PRACTICE EVERY POSSIBLE CRUELTY
HOW CAN YOU KILL PEOPLE WHEN IT IS WRITTEN IN GOD'S COMMANDMENT
THEY DO NOT FACE THE QUESTION THAT IS PRESENTED TO THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY OUGHT TO TAKE PART IN WHAT THEIR CONSCIENCE JUDGES AN EVIL ACT BUT FANCY THEMSELVES VARIOUS CONVENTIONAL PERSONAGES--ONE AS THE TZAR GOD'S ANOINTED AN EXCEPTIONAL BEING CALLED TO WATCH OVER THE HAPPINESS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF MEN
NO ONE CAN STAND STILL WHEN THE EARTH IS SHAKING UNDER HIS FEET
THE PEASANTS WERE INDIGNANT AT THIS UNJUST DECISION AND SENT THEIR WOMEN TO PREVENT THE LANDOWNER'S MEN FROM DIGGING THIS CONDUIT
AND IF ONE WILL GO TO LAW WITH THEE TO TAKE THY COAT FROM THEE GIVE HIM THY CLOAK ALSO Q
THE PEASANTS REBELLED AGAINST THIS BEING DONE
THE PEASANT'S CHILDREN NEVER PLAY AT SOLDIERS BY THE WAY WHY DO GOOD MEN AND EVEN WOMEN WHO HAVE CERTAINLY NO INTEREST IN WAR GO INTO RAPTURES OVER THE VARIOUS EXPLOITS OF SKOBELOFF AND OTHERS AND VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN GLORIFYING THEM
THEN WHEN RIGHT IS NO MORE LAW IS DEAD EVERY NOTION OF JUSTICE HAS DISAPPEARED
THE CHURCHES WITH THEIR PRINCIPLES AND THEIR PRACTICE ARE NOT A THING OF THE PAST
IN 1892 THE SAME WILLIAM THE ENFANT TERRIBLE OF STATE AUTHORITY WHO SAYS PLAINLY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ONLY THINK IN ADDRESSING SOME SOLDIERS GAVE PUBLIC UTTERANCE TO THE FOLLOWING SPEECH WHICH WAS REPORTED NEXT DAY IN THOUSANDS OF NEWSPAPERS
THE MAN WHO LOVES THE STATE KNOWS THAT HE LOVES FRANCE BOUNDED BY THE RHINE AND THE PYRENEES AND ITS PRINCIPAL CITY PARIS AND ITS HISTORY AND SO ON
THE RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN AS SACRED IS THE FIRST AND ONLY BASIS OF ALL ETHICS
BUT BY THE EXISTING THEORY HE IS PROMOTING INDUSTRY AND HE OUGHT NOT TO ABANDON HIS PURSUIT
TO LET GO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE IDEAL MEANS NOT ONLY TO DIMINISH THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFECTION BUT TO MAKE AN END OF THE IDEAL ITSELF
ONLY LET THE MIST WHICH VEILS FROM MEN'S EYES THE TRUE MEANING OF CERTAIN ACTS OF VIOLENCE PASS AWAY AND THE CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION WHICH IS SPRINGING UP WOULD OVERPOWER THE EXTINCT PUBLIC OPINION WHICH PERMITTED AND JUSTIFIED ACTS OF VIOLENCE
MOREOVER THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT NEARLY SO CLEARLY DEFINED IN THEIR DAY
THE NET OF FAITH IS CHRIST'S TEACHING WHICH OUGHT TO DRAW MAN UP OUT OF THE DARK DEPTHS OF THE SEA OF WORLDLINESS AND HIS OWN INIQUITY
LAYING DOWN IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT THE PRINCIPLES BY WHICH TO GUIDE MEN'S LIVES CHRIST SAID
TILL A FIRST A SECOND A THIRD A HUNDREDTH BEE SPREADS HER WINGS AND FLIES OFF OF HER OWN ACCORD THE SWARM WILL NOT FLY OFF AND WILL NOT BEGIN ITS NEW LIFE
IX
AND IMPERCEPTIBLE AS IT WAS AND STRANGE AS IT SEEMS TO SAY SO ALL THAT MASS OF LADS THE SOLDIERS WHO SEEMED SO SUBMISSIVE WERE IN PRECISELY THE SAME CONDITION
BY CONTINUAL INCREASE OF THE ARMED FORCE THE SOURCES OF SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL PROSPERITY ARE PARALYZED AND THE STATE OF THE MODERN WORLD MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A MAN WHO CONDEMNS HIMSELF TO WASTING FROM LACK OF NUTRITION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH ARMS LOSING THEREBY THE STRENGTH TO USE THE ARMS HE PROVIDES UNDER THE WEIGHT OF WHICH HE WILL AT LAST SUCCUMB CHARLES BOOTH IN HIS PAPER READ IN LONDON BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE REFORM AND CODIFICATION OF THE LAW OF NATIONS JUNE 26 1887 SAYS THE SAME THING
IN THE SECOND CASE A WHOLE SERIES OF EGOISTIC ACTS
SO LONG AS WE DO NOT KNOW PRECISELY HOW OUR LIFE WILL BE ORGANIZED WE WILL NOT STIR A STEP FORWARD AN EXPLORER GOING TO AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY MIGHT AS WELL ASK FOR A DETAILED MAP OF THE COUNTRY BEFORE HE WOULD START
SI AU SEIN DE CETTE DIVERSITE APPARAIT UN FONDS COMMUN DE CROYANCES N'EST-ON PAS EN DROIT D'Y VOIR NON PAS UN SYSTEME FORMULE ET COMPOSE PAR LES REPRESENTANTS D'UNE AUTORITE D'ECOLE MAIS LA FOI ELLE-MEME DONS SON INSTINCT LE PLUS SUR ET SA MANIFESTATION LA PLUS SPONTANEE
EVIL CANNOT BE SUPPRESSED BY THE PHYSICAL FORCE OF THE GOVERNMENT--THE MORAL PROGRESS OF HUMANITY IS BROUGHT ABOUT NOT ONLY BY INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION OF TRUTH BUT ALSO THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PUBLIC OPINION
ALL THEIR DUTIES ARE REDUCED TO REPRESENTING THE UNITY AND MAJESTY OF GOVERNMENT
THEY ALL MUTTER SOMETHING BUT WE'VE NO TIME TO LISTEN TO IT WE HAVE TO ENROLL SO MANY THE RECRUIT TRIES TO SAY SOMETHING STILL
BUT IT IS ALSO THE LAST EXPRESSION OF THE INCONSISTENCY INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHEN VIOLENCE IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN IT
THE EXTERNAL ASPECT IS UNCHANGED
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT APPEARING AS IT DID IN THE MIDST OF THE JEWISH AND HEATHEN WORLD SUCH TEACHING COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE MAJORITY OF MEN WHO WERE LIVING A LIFE ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS REQUIRED BY IT
IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE SAYS TO THE MAN OF THE SOCIAL STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE REPENT YE--[GREEK WORD]-I
BUT LIFE WHICH GOES ON GROWING MORE COMPLEX AND DEVELOPING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND INCREASES THE INCONSISTENCIES AND THE SUFFERINGS OF MEN BRINGS THEM TO THE LIMIT BEYOND WHICH THEY CANNOT GO
I MENTION ALL THIS TO SHOW THE UNMISTAKABLE INTEREST WHICH SUCH WORKS OUGHT TO HAVE FOR MEN WHO MAKE A PROFESSION OF CHRISTIANITY AND BECAUSE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT BALLOU'S WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL KNOWN AND THE IDEAS EXPRESSED BY HIM WOULD LAVE BEEN EITHER ACCEPTED OR REFUTED
AND I ALWAYS DROVE THEM TO EMBARRASSMENT AND CONFUSION BY REMINDING THEM OF WHAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT
THE FIRST CONSISTS IN THE BELIEF THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING INSTRUCTS MEN LIKE ALL PREVIOUS RELIGIONS BY RULES WHICH THEY ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW AND THAT THESE RULES CANNOT BE FULFILLED
IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO DREAD THE UNKNOWN WHEN OUR HABITUAL POSITION IS SOUND AND SECURE
TO SERVE THE KINGDOM OF GOD THAT IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE UNION BETWEEN ALL LIVING BEINGS--A UNION POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE TRUTH
I KNOW THAT OUR RIGHT TO QUALIFY THUS THE TENDENCIES WHICH WERE SO ACTIVELY OPPOSED BY THE EARLY FATHERS IS CONTESTED
ONE WOULD FANCY THAT SEEMED AN EASY TASK
I WILL BEGIN FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THE BIRTH OF A CHILD
PUBLIC OPINION MORE AND MORE CONDEMNS THE USE OF FORCE AND THEREFORE MEN ARE LESS AND LESS WILLING TO FILL POSITIONS WHICH REST ON THE USE OF FORCE AND IF THEY DO OCCUPY THEM ARE LESS AND LESS ABLE TO MAKE USE OF FORCE IN THEM
A MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY NEED ONLY BUY A GOSPEL FOR THREE COPECKS AND READ THROUGH THE PLAIN WORDS ADMITTING OF NO MISINTERPRETATION THAT CHRIST SAID TO THE SAMARITAN WOMAN THAT THE FATHER SEEKETH NOT WORSHIPERS AT JERUSALEM NOR IN THIS MOUNTAIN NOR IN THAT BUT WORSHIPERS IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH OR THE SAYING THAT THE CHRISTIAN MUST NOT PRAY LIKE THE HEATHEN NOR FOR SHOW BUT SECRETLY THAT IS IN HIS CLOSET OR THAT CHRIST'S FOLLOWER MUST CALL NO MAN MASTER OR FATHER--HE NEED ONLY READ THESE WORDS TO BE THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE CHURCH PASTORS WHO CALL THEMSELVES TEACHERS IN OPPOSITION TO CHRIST'S PRECEPT AND DISPUTE AMONG THEMSELVES CONSTITUTE NO KIND OF AUTHORITY AND THAT WHAT THE CHURCHMEN TEACH US IS NOT CHRISTIANITY
THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION SEEMS TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ONLY WHEN MEN MISTAKE THE POINTING TO AN IDEAL AS THE LAYING DOWN OF A RULE
THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IS AS GOOD AS IT IS NOT AS A RESULT OF FORCE BUT IN SPITE OF IT
WHILE THOSE ON THE OTHER HAND IN WHOM THE IDEA IS FOSTERED THAT THEY ARE INFERIOR ANIMALS BOUND TO OBEY THEIR SUPERIORS IN EVERYTHING FALL THROUGH THIS PERPETUAL HUMILIATION INTO A STRANGE CONDITION OF STUPEFIED SERVILITY AND IN THIS STUPEFIED STATE DO NOT SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR ACTIONS AND LOSE ALL CONSCIOUSNESS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DO
BUT THE SLAVE IS STILL A SLAVE AND THE MASTER WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT A SLAVE IS LESS DISPOSED TO SET HIM FREE THAN EVER
AND THIS MAN WHO HAS RUINED HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO CURSE HIM AND ARE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION BY HIS ACTION GOES TO MASS A SMILE OF SHINING BENEVOLENCE ON HIS SMOOTH FACE IN PERFECT FAITH IN GOOD AND IN GOD LISTENS TO THE GOSPEL CARESSES HIS CHILDREN PREACHES MORAL PRINCIPLES TO THEM AND IS MOVED BY IMAGINARY SUFFERINGS
THE PRECEPT SHOWING THE LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CANNOT FALL IS THE PROHIBITION OF SWEARING OF PROMISING ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE
THE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM OPPRESSION AND TO DELIVER THEM FROM THIS OPPRESSION THEY ARE ADVISED TO FRAME GENERAL MEASURES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR POSITION WHICH MEASURES ARE TO BE INTRUSTED TO THE AUTHORITIES AND THEMSELVES TO CONTINUE TO YIELD OBEDIENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES
AND A GOVERNMENT IS ONLY A GOVERNMENT SO LONG AS IT CAN MAKE ITSELF OBEYED AND THEREFORE IT ALWAYS STRIVES FOR THAT AND WILL NEVER WILLINGLY ABANDON ITS POWER
IF MY PRIVATE JUDGMENT IS TO DECIDE THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS DANGER FOR ANOTHER THERE IS NO OCCASION FOR THE USE OF FORCE WHICH COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND OF DANGER THREATENING SOME OTHER MAN
AND THUS THEY OFTEN SERIOUSLY SUPPOSE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN BE BOUND BY CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE
24-27 AND NOW AFTER EIGHTEEN CENTURIES THE PROPHECY HAS BEEN FULFILLED
FIGHTING
SUCH SUBJECTION TO PUBLIC OPINION ON THE PART OF THE UNINTELLECTUAL DOES NOT ASSUME AN UNNATURAL CHARACTER TILL THE PUBLIC OPINION IS SPLIT INTO TWO
THE ONE EXCLUDES THE OTHER
THEY FANCY IF THEY APPLY THEIR SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF CRITICISM THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THEIR CONCLUSION BEING CORRECT
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT ALL SUCH WORKS WHETHER OF THE QUAKERS OF GARRISON OF BALLOU OR OF HELCHITSKY ASSERTING AND PROVING AS THEY DO ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL THAT OUR MODERN WORLD TAKES A FALSE VIEW OF CHRIST'S TEACHING WOULD HAVE AWAKENED INTEREST EXCITEMENT TALK AND DISCUSSION AMONG SPIRITUAL TEACHERS AND THEIR FLOCKS ALIKE
WHY DO MEN WHO HAVE CEASED TO BELIEVE IN THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE MEDIAEVAL CHURCH AND WHO COULD NOT POSSIBLY BELIEVE IN THEM SERIOUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY PRETEND TO BELIEVE IN AND GIVE THEIR SUPPORT TO THE DEMORALIZING AND BLASPHEMOUS INSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH
THEIR ASSOCIATION INTO LARGER AND LARGER GROUPS WAS NOT THE RESULT OF THE CONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OF THE BENEFITS OF SUCH ASSOCIATIONS AS IT IS SAID TO BE IN THE STORY OF THE VARYAGI
ALL SUCH REQUIREMENTS SEEM SIMPLE COMPREHENSIBLE AND NATURAL TO US TO-DAY AND WE SEE NOTHING MYSTERIOUS OR ALARMING IN THEM
IN THE SO-CALLED ORTHODOX CATECHISM IT IS SAID
IT IS LIKE THE POSITION OF A CONQUEROR WHO IS TRYING TO SAVE A TOWN WHICH HAS BEEN BEEN SET ON FIRE BY ITS OWN INHABITANTS
MY GOVERNMENT DEMANDS FROM ME QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND BASES A SYSTEM OF SELF-DEFENSE ON GALLOWS MUSKET AND SWORD TO BE USED AGAINST ITS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC FOES
CONSEQUENTLY RULING MEANS DOING TO OTHERS WHAT WE WOULD NOT THEY SHOULD DO UNTO US THAT IS DOING WRONG
WHY SHOULD NOT THE GOVERNMENT BE PUT ON ITS TRIAL AFTER EVERY DECLARATION OF WAR
WE MAY SIMPLY LIKE SAVAGE NATIONS NOT RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF THE QUESTION
THE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION ARE SECURITY OF PROPERTY AND LABOR AND ASSOCIATED ACTION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTENCE--UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE DESTROYS ALL THIS
TAKE THOUGHT AND HAVE FAITH IN THE GOSPEL CHRIST SAID EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND HE SAYS IT WITH EVEN GREATER FORCE NOW THAT THE CALAMITIES FORETOLD BY HIM HAVE COME TO PASS AND THE SENSELESSNESS OF OUR LIFE HAS REACHED THE FURTHEST POINT OF SUFFERING AND MADNESS
AND THAT THE VIOLENT CRUELTIES PERPETRATED ON THE PEOPLE ALSO EXIST APART AND ARE THE RESULT OF SOME GENERAL JUDICIAL POLITICAL OR ECONOMICAL LAWS
AND SO THE GOVERNMENT TRIES EITHER TO COMPEL THE MAN BY ILL-TREATMENT TO RENOUNCE CHRIST OR IN SOME WAY OR OTHER TO GET RID OF HIM UNOBSERVED WITHOUT OPENLY PUTTING HIM TO DEATH AND TO HIDE SOMEHOW BOTH THE ACTION AND THE MAN HIMSELF FROM OTHER PEOPLE
IF I HAD A DOUBT NOTHING WAS CHANGED
THE MOTIVE POWER OF HIS LIFE IS PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
AND THOUGH IT IS ZEALOUSLY INCULCATED IT IS ONLY AN IMAGINED SENTIMENT
IT IS NOTHING BUT A FICTION
THE EFFECT OF MORAL INFLUENCE ON A MAN IS TO CHANGE HIS DESIRES AND TO BEND THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DUTY REQUIRED OF HIM
A MAN NEED ONLY COME TO HIMSELF FOR AN INSTANT TO BE IMPELLED INEVITABLY TO SUCH AN END
TO LEARNED MEN THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE IS EXAGGERATED AND EVEN IRRATIONAL
THE LONGER MANKIND LIVED THE CLEARER AND CLEARER BECAME THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AS MUST ALWAYS BE THE CASE WITH EVERY THEORY OF LIFE
LET US ONLY CEASE FROM LYING AND PRETENDING THAT WE DO NOT SEE THIS TRUTH OR WISH TO REALIZE IT AT LEAST IN WHAT IT DEMANDS FROM US ABOVE ALL ELSE
BUT REMEMBERING THE MAGIC PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES NO ONE VENTURES TO SAY THAT HE HAS NOTHING ON TILL A LITTLE CHILD CRIES OUT
THE GREEK WORD ABOVE USED GREEK LETTERS SPELLED
THE GREEK WORD ABOVE USED GREEK LETTERS SPELLED
SO IT WAS UNDER NERO AND GHENGHIS KHAN AND SO IT IS TO-DAY EVEN UNDER THE MOST LIBERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE REPUBLICS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF FRANCE
IF ANY MAN WILL DO HIS WILL HE SHALL KNOW OF THE DOCTRINE WHETHER IT BE OF GOD JOHN VIII
NOT ONE OF THESE SOLDIERS WOULD SPIT OUT THE HOLY SACRAMENT OR EAT MEAT ON GOOD FRIDAY
THIRD EMBRACING THE WHOLE WORLD OR THE DIVINE VIEW OF LIFE
3 4
BESIDES THE DUTIES WHICH HAD THEN BEEN ONLY VAGUELY AND MYSTICALLY EXPRESSED BY A FEW PROPHETS HAVE NOW BEEN SO CLEARLY FORMULATED HAVE BECOME SUCH TRUISMS THAT THEY ARE REPEATED EVEN BY SCHOOLBOYS AND JOURNALISTS
IF THERE WERE NO EXTERNAL MEANS OF DULLING THEIR SENSIBILITIES HALF OF MANKIND WOULD SHOOT THEMSELVES WITHOUT DELAY FOR TO LIVE IN OPPOSITION TO ONE'S REASON IS THE MOST INTOLERABLE CONDITION
HE CAN ONLY BE AN ARTISAN OR A HUSBANDMAN
THIS NEW DOCTRINE WAS IN BOTH FORM AND CONTENT ABSOLUTELY NEW TO THE JEWISH WORLD IN WHICH IT ORIGINATED AND STILL MORE TO THE ROMAN WORLD IN WHICH IT WAS PREACHED AND DIFFUSED
BUT HISTORY SHOWS THAT FROM CAESAR TO NAPOLEON AND FROM NAPOLEON TO BISMARCK GOVERNMENT IS IN ITS ESSENCE ALWAYS A FORCE ACTING IN VIOLATION OF JUSTICE AND THAT IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE
WHY SHOULD I PROMISE TO YIELD OBEDIENCE TO EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DECREED FIRST BY SALISBURY THEN BY GLADSTONE
YOU SAY THAT YOU COMMIT THESE ACTS OF CRUELTY BECAUSE YOU ARE A PART OF THE SOCIETY AND OF THE STATE
YOU SEND A BOY TO SUNDAY SCHOOL AND YOU TELL HIM
THE PATRIOTIC SUPERSTITION IS ENCOURAGED BY THE CREATION WITH MONEY TAKEN FROM THE PEOPLE OF NATIONAL FETES SPECTACLES MONUMENTS AND FESTIVALS TO DISPOSE MEN TO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO THEIR OWN NATION AND TO THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE STATE AND ITS RULERS AND TO FEEL ANTAGONISM AND EVEN HATRED FOR OTHER NATIONS
WHAT FORCES THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS UNCHANGING AND THEY MUST SUPPORT IT
ON THE CONTRARY HE WILL BEAR VIOLENCE WITHOUT OPPOSING IT
AND THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARRY PASSPORTS OR PAY THE DUTY ON THEM
ALL CHURCH PREACHERS RECOGNIZE CASES IN WHICH THAT COMMAND CAN BE BROKEN AND TEACH THE PEOPLE ACCORDINGLY
BUT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE WORD SAID OF THE OBJECT TO WHICH HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE
IN WHAT WAY ARE WE TO DECIDE MEN'S DISPUTES WHEN SOME MEN CONSIDER EVIL WHAT OTHERS CONSIDER GOOD AND VICE VERSA
THEY OPEN AT LAST AND OUT COME THE CONSCRIPTS UNSTEADY BUT TRYING TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON IT
WHAT HAVE THEY INVENTED
AND BESIDES HOW ARE WE TO FIND THE MOMENT WHEN PUBLIC OPINION HAS BECOME STRONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE USE OF FORCE
BUT WHILE WE SHALL ADHERE TO THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE AND PASSIVE SUBMISSION TO ENEMIES WE PURPOSE IN A MORAL AND SPIRITUAL SENSE TO ASSAIL INIQUITY IN HIGH PLACES AND IN LOW PLACES TO APPLY OUR PRINCIPLES TO ALL EXISTING EVIL POLITICAL LEGAL AND ECCLESIASTICAL INSTITUTIONS AND TO HASTEN THE TIME WHEN THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD WILL HAVE BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
AND THEREFORE THE MORE SINCERELY MEN STRIVE TOWARD THE TRUTH THE NEARER THEY GET TO UNITY
I CANNOT DISPUTE THE QUESTION WITH THEM I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF
THIS ARGUMENT I FOUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN JOHN CHRYSOSTOM AND I SHOW HOW HE IS MISTAKEN IN MY BOOK WHAT I BELIEVE THIS ARGUMENT IS ILL GROUNDED BECAUSE IF WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO REGARD ANY MEN AS INTRINSICALLY WICKED MEN THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ANNUL BY SO DOING THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING ACCORDING TO WHICH WE ARE ALL EQUALS AND BROTHERS AS SONS OF ONE FATHER IN HEAVEN
WE OUGHT ONLY TO TRY TO PUT AUTHORITY INTO THE BEST HANDS AND THIS CRITICISM WOULD BE PERFECTLY JUST IF THE TRANSITION FROM ONE CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO ANOTHER WERE ONLY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE SINGLE PROCESS OF ALL MEN SEPARATELY AND SUCCESSIVELY REALIZING EACH FOR HIMSELF THE EMPTINESS OF POWER AND REACHING CHRISTIAN TRUTH BY THE INNER SPIRITUAL PATH
ARE ALL MEN BOUND TO ACT AS TOLSTOY TEACHES--I
WE TALK OF THE HYPOCRISY OF THE PHARISEES
HE IS READY
THE SOLDIERS GIVE THE POWER OF PUNISHING AND PLUNDERING THEM AND PURCHASING OFFICIALS WITH THE SPOILS AND HYPNOTIZING THEM AND CONVERTING THEM IN TIME INTO THESE SAME SOLDIERS AGAIN
THE MAJORITY OF THEM DO NOT KEEP UP THEIR OLD UNAPPROACHABLE MAJESTY BUT BECOME MORE AND MORE DEMOCRATIZED AND EVEN VULGARIZED CASTING ASIDE THE EXTERNAL PRESTIGE THAT REMAINED TO THEM AND THEREBY DESTROYING THE VERY THING IT WAS THEIR FUNCTION TO MAINTAIN
BUT THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING OF THE KIND
A GREAT DEAL WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME BY BOTH HOSTILE AND SYMPATHETIC CRITICISM AND ALSO BY THE HISTORICAL EVENTS OF LATE YEARS
WHY SHOULD I PUNISH MYSELF
WAS RULER OR WHEN CROMWELL
AT ONCE BEGINS THE SERIES OF LONG CLEVER INGENIOUS AND SOLEMN SPEECHES AND WRITINGS WHICH DEAL WITH QUESTIONS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUBJECT BUT SKILLFULLY AVOID TOUCHING THE SUBJECT ITSELF
MEN HAVE COME TO THE POINT OF CEASING TO BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OR EVEN DESIRABILITY OF FINDING AND ESTABLISHING SUCH A GENERAL DEFINITION
I DO NOT SAY THAT IF YOU ARE A LANDOWNER YOU ARE BOUND TO GIVE UP YOUR LANDS IMMEDIATELY TO THE POOR
WORKS OF THIS KIND DEALING WITH THE VERY ESSENCE OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OUGHT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN EXAMINED AND ACCEPTED AS TRUE OR REFUTED AND REJECTED
IF A MAN SINCERELY BELIEVES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT THE NICENE CREED MUST INEVITABLY LOSE ALL MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIM AND THE CHURCH AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES TOGETHER WITH IT
FINE SUBJECT FOR THE ANTITHESIS OF RHETORIC OF HUMANITARIANS WHO COULD NOT FAIL TO WHIMPER OVER THIS JUXTAPOSITION AND TO SAY THAT CECI TUERA CELA FOOTNOTE
IF IN THE MIDST OF THIS DIVERSITY A MASS OF BELIEFS COMMON TO ALL IS APPARENT IS ONE NOT JUSTIFIED IN SEEING IN IT NOT A FORMULATED SYSTEM FRAMED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF PEDANTIC AUTHORITY BUT FAITH ITSELF IN ITS SUREST INSTINCT AND ITS MOST SPONTANEOUS MANIFESTATION
ERROR CAN NEVER BE CORRECTED BY ERROR AND EVIL CANNOT BE VANQUISHED BY EVIL
HE BRINGS BEFORE US ALL THE CRUELTY OF THE INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN MEN'S MORAL SENSE AND THEIR ACTIONS BUT WITHOUT TRYING TO REMOVE IT
I AM DEAR SIR ETC
THE LEARNED DOCTOR STOOD BY IN READINESS TO GIVE HIS AID AND HIS MEDICAL SCIENCE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE NEEDED
BE SUBDUED BY THE DIFFUSION OF A CHRISTIAN STANDARD AMONG THEM WHILE ACTUALLY CHRISTIAN NATIONS IN ORDER TO SUBDUE THEM DO ALL THEY CAN TO DESTROY A CHRISTIAN STANDARD--THESE FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO CIVILIZE SAVAGES CANNOT BE ADDUCED AS PROOFS THAT MEN CANNOT BE SUBDUED BY CHRISTIANITY--VIOLENCE BY CORRUPTING PUBLIC OPINION ONLY HINDERS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION FROM BEING WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE--AND BY THE USE OF VIOLENCE BEING SUPPRESSED A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE ESTABLISHED--WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF THE SUPPRESSION OF USE OF FORCE THIS UNKNOWN FUTURE COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN THE PRESENT CONDITION AND SO THERE IS NO NEED TO DREAD IT--TO ATTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNKNOWN AND TO MOVE TOWARD IT IS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE
TO SAY AS IS USUALLY SAID AND AS THEY WOULD THEMSELVES REPEAT THAT THEY ARE ACTING FROM CONVICTION OF THE NECESSITY FOR SUPPORTING THE STATE ORGANIZATION WOULD BE A MISTAKE
LIVE IN PEACE WITH ALL MEN
SO THAT ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE ALL THE FOUNDERS OF RELIGIONS SUCH AS MOSES AND THE PROPHETS CONFUCIUS LAO-TSE BUDDHA CHRIST AND OTHERS PREACHED THEIR DOCTRINES AND THEIR FOLLOWERS ACCEPTED THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY LOVED THE TRUTH BUT BECAUSE THE POLITICAL SOCIAL AND ABOVE ALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLES AMONG WHOM THESE RELIGIONS AROSE WERE FAVORABLE FOR THEIR ORIGINATION AND DEVELOPMENT
THE INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE NOT DEARER TO US THAN THOSE OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
CHRIST IS TEACHING NOT ANGELS BUT MEN LIVING AND MOVING IN THE ANIMAL LIFE
LIVE IN OPPOSITION TO YOUR NATURE UNDERSTANDING BY THIS ONLY THE ANIMAL NATURE MAKE IT SUBJECT TO THE EXTERNAL LAW OF FAMILY SOCIETY AND STATE CHRISTIANITY SAYS
PEOPLE WHO OWN GREAT ESTATES OR FORTUNES OR WHO RECEIVE GREAT REVENUES DRAWN FROM THE CLASS WHO ARE IN WANT EVEN OF NECESSITIES THE WORKING CLASS AS WELL AS ALL THOSE WHO LIKE MERCHANTS DOCTORS ARTISTS CLERKS LEARNED PROFESSORS COACHMEN COOKS WRITERS VALETS AND BARRISTERS MAKE THEIR LIVING ABOUT THESE RICH PEOPLE LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRIVILEGES THEY ENJOY ARE NOT THE RESULT OF FORCE BUT OF ABSOLUTELY FREE AND JUST INTERCHANGE OF SERVICES AND THAT THEIR ADVANTAGES FAR FROM BEING GAINED BY SUCH PUNISHMENTS AND MURDERS AS TOOK PLACE IN OREL AND SEVERAL PARTS OF RUSSIA THIS YEAR AND ARE ALWAYS TAKING PLACE ALL OVER EUROPE AND AMERICA HAVE NO KIND OF CONNECTION WITH THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OF REACHING THE PLACE WHERE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A WEALTHY YOUNG MAN WITH THREE THOUSAND RUBLES STOLEN FROM A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF FAMISHING PEASANTS THEY MAY BE FORCED TO COMMIT THE MOST HORRIBLE ACTS ONE CAN CONCEIVE TO MURDER OR TORTURE AS WAS DONE IN OREL INNOCENT BEINGS THEIR BROTHERS
LIFE IS TO DO NOT ONE'S WILL BUT THE WILL OF GOD
AND THOSE WHO CONTROL THEM NEVER ALLOW THEM TO UNITE TOGETHER
THE TRIAL TAKES PLACE AND HE IS SENTENCED TO CONFINEMENT IN THE MILITARY PRISON FOR TWO YEARS
NOT ONLY HAVE CHURCHES NEVER BOUND MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY
HE SEES IN THIS THE TRAGEDY OF HUMAN LIFE AND AFTER DEPICTING ALL THE HORROR OF THE POSITION HE CONCLUDES THAT HUMAN LIFE MUST BE SPENT IN THE MIDST OF THIS HORROR
3 OF HERETICAL SUBJECTS THEMSELVES
CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW
AMONG THE FIRST RESPONSES CALLED FORTH BY MY BOOK WERE SOME LETTERS FROM AMERICAN QUAKERS
SLAUGHTER
AND THIS WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL AND IN MANY CASES THE AUTHORS WERE RIGHT--RIGHT THAT IS IN REGARD TO PERSONS WHO DID NOT RENOUNCE THE BENEFITS THEY RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND TRIED TO AVOID THE HARDSHIPS OF MILITARY SERVICE BUT NOT RIGHT IN REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-RESISTANCE ITSELF
AND AMAZING ARE THEY TOO WHO LIKE MAUPASSANT ROD AND MANY OTHERS SEE CLEARLY ALL THE HORROR OF WAR ALL THE INCONSISTENCY OF MEN NOT DOING WHAT IS NEEDFUL RIGHT AND BENEFICIAL FOR THEM TO DO
BUT THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE OTHER MISTAKEN IDEAS ABOUT IT IS THE NOTION THAT CHRISTIANITY IS A DOCTRINE WHICH CAN BE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF LIFE
IF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE SEEM STRANGE AND EVEN ALARMING TO THE MAN OF THE SOCIAL THEORY OF LIFE NO LESS STRANGE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND ALARMING TO THE SAVAGE OF ANCIENT TIMES SEEMED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOCIAL DOCTRINE WHEN IT WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND COULD NOT BE FORESEEN IN ITS RESULTS
THE PROSECUTORS THEMSELVES OFTEN REFUSE TO PROCEED AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO PROCEED OFTEN IN SPITE OF THE LAW REALLY DEFEND THOSE THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCUSING
IT IS EVEN LESS POSSIBLE TO ASSERT THAT ALL THESE MEN ARE SUCH BRUTES THAT IT IS NATURAL AND NOT DISTASTEFUL TO THEM TO DO SUCH DEEDS
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT
MEN HAVE LONG AGO RECOGNIZED THAT IT IS IRRATIONAL TO OBEY A LAW THE JUSTICE OF WHICH IS VERY DOUBTFUL AND SO THEY CANNOT BUT SUFFER IN OBEYING A LAW WHICH THEY DO NOT ACCEPT AS JUDICIOUS AND BINDING
THE MOST DELICATE AND MORAL PEOPLE THEY ARE GENERALLY ALSO THE MOST CULTIVATED AVOID SUCH POSITIONS AND PREFER MORE HUMBLE CALLINGS THAT ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE USE OF FORCE
BUT ONE NEED ONLY RECALL THE FACTS OF HISTORY NOT THE HISTORY OF THE EXPLOITS OF DIFFERENT DYNASTIES OF RULERS BUT REAL HISTORY THE HISTORY OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE MAJORITY BY A SMALL NUMBER OF MEN TO SEE THAT ALL THE ADVANTAGES THE RICH HAVE OVER THE POOR ARE BASED ON NOTHING BUT FLOGGING IMPRISONMENT AND MURDER
AND AGAIN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FORCE THOSE PEOPLE BY ANY MEANS TO DO WHAT IS REQUIRED
WHAT UTTERANCES DID CHRIST REFER TO IN THE WORDS IT WAS SAID OF OLD
AND CAN HE BY TAKING HIS SHARE OF SERVICE IN THE ARMY PREPARE HIMSELF TO MURDER MEN AND EVEN ACTUALLY MURDER THEM
AND SO TO THIS ANIMAL FORCE OF MOVEMENT CHRIST AS IT WERE APPLIES THE NEW FORCE-THE RECOGNITION OF DIVINE PERFECTION-AND THEREBY DIRECTS THE MOVEMENT BY THE RESULTANT OF THESE TWO FORCES
THE PATH OF CIVILIZATION ON WHICH MANKIND IN EUROPE IS MOVING IS IN THEIR OPINION THE ONE ALONG WHICH ALL MANKIND OUGHT ALWAYS TO MOVE
THE SLOW PROGRESS OF EIGHTEEN CENTURIES HAS BROUGHT THE CHRISTIAN NATIONS AGAIN TO THE NECESSITY OF DECIDING THE QUESTION THEY HAVE EVADED--THE QUESTION OF THE ACCEPTANCE OR NON-ACCEPTANCE OF CHRIST'S TEACHING AND THE QUESTION FOLLOWING UPON IT IN SOCIAL LIFE OF RESISTANCE OR NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
AND HERE WERE THE SOLDIERS WITH BAYONETS AND CARTRIDGES AND MOREOVER A SUPPLY OF RODS EXPRESSLY PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE AND HEAPED UP IN ONE OF THE TRUCKS GOING TO CARRY THE DECISION OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES INTO EFFECT
WITHOUT THE CONVICTION THAT IT IS EXPECTED BY THE WHOLE PEOPLE NOT A SINGLE KING EMPEROR PRESIDENT OR PARLIAMENT WOULD ORDER MURDERS OR ACTS OF VIOLENCE
ALL VIOLENCE RESTS WE KNOW ON THOSE WHO DO THE BEATING THE HANDCUFFING THE IMPRISONING AND THE KILLING WITH THEIR OWN HANDS
AND SO THEY HAVE COME DRINKING SWEARING SINGING FIGHTING AND SCUFFLING WITH ONE ANOTHER
IN THE FACT THAT IT ALONE ALLOWS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ERADICATING EVIL FROM ONE'S OWN HEART AND ALSO FROM ONE'S NEIGHBOR'S
IF YOU DO SO YOU WILL BE DOING THE BEST THING POSSIBLE
WHO LAMENT OVER THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE AND DO NOT SEE THAT THE WHOLE TRAGEDY IS AT AN END DIRECTLY MEN CEASING TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ANY UNNECESSARY CONSIDERATIONS REFUSE TO DO WHAT IS HATEFUL AND DISASTROUS TO THEM
BUT THE YOUNG BIRDS WILL DECIDE THE QUESTION WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR OUR ARGUMENTS WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES CRAMPED FOR SPACE IN THE EGGS
QUESTIONS SHALL BE DECIDED BY A COURT OF ARBITRATION
THEY HAVE THEREFORE THE STRENGTH TO RESIST DOING WHAT IS AGAINST THEIR PRINCIPLES
THIS CONSISTS IN REPRESENTING THE EXISTING STATE ORGANIZATION--WHATEVER IT MAY BE FREE REPUBLIC OR THE MOST SAVAGE DESPOTISM--AS SOMETHING SACRED AND IMMUTABLE AND THEREFORE FOLLOWING ANY EFFORTS TO ALTER IT WITH THE CRUELLEST PUNISHMENTS
MEN DO NOT ONLY ASSIMILATE A TRUTH THROUGH RECOGNIZING IT BY PROPHETIC INSIGHT OR BY EXPERIENCE OF LIFE
BUT THIS LAST CLASS WHO DO NOT ARGUE WHO DO NOT CONDESCEND TO ARGUE ABOUT IT BUT TAKE SHELTER BEHIND THEIR OWN GRANDEUR AND MAKE A SHOW OF ALL THIS HAVING BEEN DECIDED BY THEM OR AT LEAST BY SOMEONE LONG AGO AND NO LONGER OFFERING A POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT TO ANYONE--THEY SEEM SAFE FROM ATTACK AND WILL BE BEYOND ATTACK TILL MEN COME TO REALIZE THAT THEY ARE UNDER THE NARCOTIC INFLUENCE EXERTED ON THEM BY GOVERNMENTS AND CHURCHES AND ARE NO LONGER AFFECTED BY IT
IF YOU DID NOT DESIRE THAT POSITION YOU WOULD NOT BE DOING YOUR UTMOST TO RETAIN IT
ALL THESE VARIED FORMS OF LIFE ARE FOUNDED ON THE SAME CONCEPTION THAT THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A SUFFICIENT AIM OF LIFE--THAT THE MEANING OF LIFE CAN BE FOUND ONLY IN SOCIETIES OF INDIVIDUALS THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE DIVINE THEORY OF LIFE RECOGNIZES LIFE NOT IN HIS OWN INDIVIDUALITY AND NOT IN SOCIETIES OF INDIVIDUALITIES IN THE FAMILY THE CLAN THE NATION THE TRIBE OR THE GOVERNMENT BUT IN THE ETERNAL UNDYING SOURCE OF LIFE--IN GOD
BUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE COULD NOT IN ANY CASE BE INCREASED BY THE MERE FACT OF POWER PASSING FROM ONE SET OF MEN TO ANOTHER
BUT HERE COMES A MAN ALONG THE STREET WITH FLOWING HAIR AND IN A PECULIAR DRESS WHO GETS OUT OF HIS DROSKHY AND GOES INTO THE ZEMSKY COURT-HOUSE
IT EXPRESSES A LOFTY CHRISTIAN VIRTUE ENJOINED ON US BY CHRIST
IT IS THE TRUEST MEANS OF FORGIVING INJURIES AND LOVING ENEMIES
WE OUGHT TO MANAGE SO THAT STATES COULD NOT MAKE THE ATTACK SUDDENLY AND INVADE EACH OTHER'S TERRITORIES WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS THIS PRACTICAL NOTION HAS BEEN PUT FORTH BY MAXIME DU CAMP AND HIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH IT
CHRISTIANITY IN ITS TRUE SENSE PUTS AN END TO GOVERNMENT
I HAVE NO REASON TO DO IT
23
LA THEOLOGIE N'EST POINT LIEE A D'INVARIABLES FORMULES
THE CHURCH AS AN INSTITUTION WHICH ASSERTED THAT IT POSSESSED INFALLIBLE TRUTH DID NOT MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SINGLY
IT IS UNREASONABLE SAYS THE SOCIALIZED MAN TO SACRIFICE MY WELFARE AND THAT OF MY FAMILY AND MY COUNTRY IN ORDER TO FULFILL SOME HIGHER LAW WHICH REQUIRES ME TO RENOUNCE MY MOST NATURAL AND VIRTUOUS FEELINGS OF LOVE OF SELF OF FAMILY OF KINDRED AND OF COUNTRY
ALL THAT THEY CAN DO TO SAVE THEMSELVES IS ONLY DEFERRING THE HOUR OF THEIR DOWNFALL
STILL THERE ARE AMONG THE RICH ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG AND AMONG WOMEN PERSONS WHOM I AM GLAD TO MEET MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHO WHEN THEY ARE SHOWN IN WHAT WAY AND AT WHAT COST THEIR PLEASURES ARE PURCHASED DO NOT TRY TO CONCEAL THE TRUTH BUT HIDING THEIR HEADS IN THEIR HANDS CRY
ONLY FROM THE TIME THAT THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ASSUMED AN EXTERNAL AND NOMINAL CHRISTIANITY MEN BEGAN TO INVENT ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE CUNNINGLY DEVISED THEORIES BY MEANS OF WHICH CHRISTIANITY CAN BE RECONCILED WITH GOVERNMENT
THE FIRST MISCONCEPTION IN REGARD TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE IS THE RESULT OF MEN OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAKING THAT CONCEPTION AS THE STANDARD BY WHICH THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION DIRECTS MEN AND TAKING THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE OF PERFECTION AS THE RULE BY WHICH THAT LIFE IS TO BE ORDERED
AND JUST AS YOUR DUTIES TO YOUR FAMILY AND TO SOCIETY ARE SUBORDINATE TO YOUR SUPERIOR DUTIES TO THE STATE IN THE SAME WAY THE LATTER MUST NECESSARILY BE SUBORDINATED TO THE DUTIES DICTATED TO YOU BY THE ETERNAL LIFE AND BY GOD
TO SAY NOTHING OF JUDGES AND JURIES WHO CONDEMN MEN TO DEATH AND SOLDIERS WHO KILL MEN BY THOUSANDS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SCRUPLE MERELY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN INSTILLED INTO THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY MEN BUT JURORS JUDGES GENERALS AND SOLDIERS
I REGARD WAR AS A FATAL NECESSITY WHICH APPEARS INEVITABLE FOR US FROM ITS CLOSE CONNECTION WITH HUMAN NATURE AND THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION OF THE WORLD
WE LOVE THE LAND OF OUR NATIVITY ONLY AS WE LOVE ALL OTHER LANDS
THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS ALL DECLARE THAT THEY ALL WISH FOR PEACE AND VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE MOST SOLEMN PROTESTATIONS OF PEACEFUL INTENTIONS
ANNIHILATION OF LIFE CANNOT BE A MEANS OF THE AMELIORATION OF LIFE
WOE UNTO YOU WHEN ALL MEN SHALL SPEAK WELL OF YOU FOR THE MEN WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF POWER AND ALL THAT RESULTS FROM IT--GLORY AND WEALTH--AND HAVE ATTAINED THE VARIOUS AIMS THEY SET BEFORE THEMSELVES RECOGNIZE THE VANITY OF IT ALL AND RETURN TO THE POSITION FROM WHICH THEY CAME
ALL MEN MAY ACCEPT CHRISTIANITY AND ALL THE REFORMS DESIRED BY THE BELLAMYS MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT WITH EVERY POSSIBLE ADDITION AND IMPROVEMENT BUT IF THE HYPOCRISY WHICH RULES NOWADAYS STILL EXISTS IF MEN DO NOT PROFESS THE TRUTH THEY KNOW BUT CONTINUE TO FEIGN BELIEF IN WHAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE AND VENERATION FOR WHAT THEY DO NOT RESPECT THEIR CONDITION WILL REMAIN THE SAME OR EVEN GROW WORSE AND WORSE
HE TOUCHES HIS SKIN WITH A RED-HOT IRON
UNDER THE 4TH HEAD OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HERETICS ARE MADE HE SAYS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE 7TH
ONE DAY BY BOULANGER AND ANOTHER BY PARLIAMENT
AND IN OUR CHRISTIAN WORLD WE DO NOT EVEN SUPPOSE SUCH A CUSTOM AND WE HAVE NOTHING ON WHICH TO BUILD UP THE SUPPOSITION THAT IT IS THE GOOD OR THE SUPERIOR WHO ARE IN POWER
THE LAW RESTING ON FORCE ONLY PUNISHES CERTAIN FORMS OF COVETOUSNESS SUCH AS ROBBERY AND SWINDLING CERTAIN FORMS OF PROFLIGACY AND CRUELTY SUCH AS CONJUGAL INFIDELITY MURDER AND WOUNDING
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE HYPNOTIZED BY SCIENTIFIC MEN AND THOSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STATE HYPNOTISM IS THAT AN IMAGINARY POSITION IS SUGGESTED TO THE FORMER SUDDENLY BY ONE PERSON IN A VERY BRIEF SPACE OF TIME AND SO THE HYPNOTIZED STATE APPEARS TO US IN A STRIKING AND SURPRISING FORM WHILE THE IMAGINARY POSITION SUGGESTED BY STATE INFLUENCE IS INDUCED SLOWLY LITTLE BY LITTLE IMPERCEPTIBLY FROM CHILDHOOD SOMETIMES DURING YEARS OR EVEN GENERATIONS AND NOT IN ONE PERSON ALONE BUT IN A WHOLE SOCIETY
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE SHOWS MAN THAT THE ESSENCE OF HIS SOUL IS LOVE--THAT HIS HAPPINESS DEPENDS NOT ON LOVING THIS OR THAT OBJECT BUT ON LOVING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE--GOD WHOM HE RECOGNIZES WITHIN HIMSELF AS LOVE AND THEREFORE HE LOVES ALL THINGS AND ALL MEN
INDEED GOVERNMENT IS MORE OFTEN AN OBSTACLE THAN AN ASSISTANCE IN ATTAINING THESE AIMS
BUT SINCE THE EXHORTATION IN CHRIST'S NAME TO FORSWEAR CHRIST IS FOR THE MOST PART UNSUCCESSFUL AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED THE ADMONITIONS OF THE SPIRITUAL AUTHORITIES THEY SEND HIM TO THE GENDARMES AND THE LATTER FINDING AS A RULE NO POLITICAL CAUSE FOR OFFENSE IN HIM DISPATCH HIM BACK AGAIN AND THEN HE IS SENT TO THE LEARNED MEN TO THE DOCTORS AND TO THE MADHOUSE
THAT IS JUST WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WHO THINK TO MAKE MEN ADVANCE BY MEANS OF EXTERNAL FORCE
SO IT WOULD BE WERE IT NOT FOR THE LAW OF INERTIA AS IMMUTABLE A FORCE IN MEN AND NATIONS AS IN INANIMATE BODIES
WAR TOO IS A CHRISTIAN DUTY
THEY KNOW ALL THE HATRED OF THEM EXISTING AND INEVITABLY EXISTING IN THE WORKING CLASSES
FROM THIS INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE NEW CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND PRACTICAL LIFE FOLLOWS A WHOLE SUCCESSION OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS WHICH EMBITTER OUR LIFE AND NECESSITATE ITS ALTERATION
IF IT HAD A PROGRAMME OF THE LIFE WHICH AWAITED IT BEFORE ENTERING A NEW STAGE IT WOULD BE THE SUREST SIGN THAT IT WAS NOT LIVING NOR ADVANCING BUT SIMPLY ROTATING IN THE SAME PLACE
HAVING THUS STATED OUR PRINCIPLES WE PROCEED TO SPECIFY THE MEASURES WE PROPOSE TO ADOPT IN CARRYING OUR OBJECT INTO EFFECT
AFTER DELIBERATION AMONG THEMSELVES THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES DECIDE TO GET RID OF THE TROUBLESOME YOUNG MAN TO CONSIDER HIM AS A REVOLUTIONIST AND THEY DISPATCH HIM UNDER ESCORT TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE SECRET POLICE
THE HIGHER HIS GRADE THE MORE HE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DEMANDS FROM BELOW AND THE LESS HE IS CONTROLLED BY ORDERS FROM ABOVE AND VICE VERSA
THAT NOAH SHUT UP ALL THE ANIMALS IN HIS ARK AND SO ON
THE MEANS OF INSTRUCTION ARE
IT HAS BEEN MY AIM TO GIVE A FAITHFUL REPRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL
EVERYWHERE THE EARTH IS SHAKING UNDER OUR FEET AND STORM-CLOUDS ARE GATHERING ON OUR HORIZON WHICH WILL HAVE NO PITY ON US
AND HOW CAN IT NOT BE DIFFICULT WHEN THE BREACH OF IT IS NOT ONLY NOT FORBIDDEN BUT LAW COURTS PRISONS CANNONS GUNS ARMIES AND WARS ARE UNDER THE IMMEDIATE SANCTION OF THE CHURCH
CHRISTIANITY CANNOT AS ITS FOUNDER SAID BE REALIZED BY THE MAJORITY OF MEN ALL AT ONCE
BUT BELIEVE IT THEY CANNOT BECAUSE IT HAS NO MEANING FOR THEM
I WILL GIVE THE DETAILS OF ONE OF THE FIRST CASES SINCE THEY HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT WHICH I HAPPEN TO KNOW ABOUT FOOTNOTE
THAT ITS TEACHING IN RELATION TO LIFE IS UNREASONABLE AND IS AN EXAGGERATION SUBVERSIVE OF THE REAL LAWFUL OBLIGATIONS OF MORALITY CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURE OF MAN
COME FOR A WALK IN THE TOWN WITH ME THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED TO THEM
YOU SAY THAT MEN USED TO PILLAGE AND MURDER IN THE PAST AND THAT YOU ARE AFRAID THAT THEY WILL PILLAGE AND MURDER ONE ANOTHER IF YOUR POWER WERE NO MORE
MOREOVER THE CONDITION OF THINGS IN WHICH WE ARE LIVING NOW WE KNOW GOOD OR BAD
THE SOLDIERS AGAIN HUSTLE AND HURRY THE LAD
LA POLEMIQUE CONTRE L'ERREUR N'A D'AUTRES RESSOURCES QUE LA PENSEE ET LE SENTIMENT
HERE IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE DIARY OF NICHOLAS MYRAVYOV OF KARS WHICH WAS NOT PASSED BY THE CENSOR AND IS NOT KNOWN IN RUSSIA
IT BEGINS IN THEIR EARLIEST YEARS IN THE COMPULSORY SCHOOLS CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN WHICH THE CHILDREN HAVE INSTILLED INTO THEM THE IDEAS OF LIFE OF THEIR ANCESTORS WHICH ARE IN DIRECT ANTAGONISM WITH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE MODERN WORLD
AND I NOT ONLY DON'T WANT TO BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE WHAT IT DEMANDS OF ME IS AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE
THEY ALL KNOW IT
EVEN IF YOU ARE TOLD THAT ALL THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS AND THAT THIS SOCIAL ORDER WITH ITS PAUPERISM FAMINES PRISONS GALLOWS ARMIES AND WARS IS NECESSARY TO SOCIETY
DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE MUST INEVITABLY BE ACCEPTED BY MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY
16
AND SO YOU ARE YOURSELVES THESE WICKED MEN AGAINST WHOM ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN ARGUMENT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO USE VIOLENCE THE OPPRESSED ARE SURE TO SAY TO THEIR OPPRESSORS
WE SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF THEIR TERROR
ONLY NOT DARING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS THEY TRY TO CONCEAL THEIR NOT RECOGNIZING IT
THAT IT IS NOT SAFE TO RELY UPON THE STRENGTH OF AN ARM TO PRESERVE US FROM HARM
IF THE ROMAN OR THE MAN OF MEDIAEVAL TIMES OR THE AVERAGE RUSSIAN OF FIFTY YEARS AGO AS I REMEMBER HIM WAS CONVINCED WITHOUT A SHADE OF DOUBT THAT THE VIOLENCE OF AUTHORITY WAS INDISPENSABLE TO PRESERVE HIM FROM EVIL
THE TRANSFERENCE TO THE TRIBE OR THE NATION IS MORE DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES SPECIAL TRAINING
3 THAT THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS BE ADOPTED
THESE EIGHTEEN CENTURIES HAVE BROUGHT MEN SO FAR THAT EVEN WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO LIVE THE PAGAN LIFE WHICH IS NO LONGER CONSISTENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY THEY NOT ONLY SEE CLEARLY ALL THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THEIR POSITION BUT IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR SOULS THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN ONLY LIVE THROUGH THIS BELIEF THAT THE ONLY SALVATION FROM THIS POSITION IS TO BE FOUND IN FULFILLING THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE
THE WORKING CLASSES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PHYSICAL LABOR AND ARE SO FAR FIT FOR NOTHING ELSE
HYPOCRISY IN THE GREEK MEANS ACTING AND ACTING--PLAYING A PART--IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE
THE SOLDIERS FIRE AND THE KILLED AND WOUNDED FALL ABOUT THE STREET
BESIDES THIS THE RUSSIAN CRITICS HAVE POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO PRACTICAL LIFE WOULD TURN MANKIND ASIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF CIVILIZATION ALONG WHICH IT IS MOVING
THE CHRISTIAN ACTS ACCORDING TO THE WORDS OF THE PROPHECY APPLIED TO HIS TEACHER
THESE BOUGHT OFFICIALS FROM THE HIGHEST MINISTERS TO THE POOREST COPYING CLERKS MAKE UP AN UNBROKEN NETWORK OF MEN BOUND TOGETHER BY THE SAME INTEREST--THAT OF LIVING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PEOPLE
ANYONE WHO SERVES HIS TIME IN THE ARMY SHARES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT WHICH HE IS IN SOME CASES DUBIOUS WHILE VERY OFTEN THEY ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO HIS CONSCIENCE
THEY HAVE MOSTLY BEEN ONLY LATELY TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND ARE FULL OF THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE GOOD RATIONAL NATURAL LIFE THEY HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEM
JUST AS A TRAINED TIGER WHO DOES NOT EAT MEAT PUT UNDER HIS NOSE AND JUMPS OVER A STICK AT THE WORD OF COMMAND DOES NOT ACT THUS BECAUSE HE LIKES IT BUT BECAUSE HE REMEMBERS THE RED-HOT IRONS OR THE FAST WITH WHICH HE WAS PUNISHED EVERY TIME HE DID NOT OBEY
THE PAID POLITICIANS THE AMBITIOUS STATESMEN WHO EXPLOIT THE EVIL PASSIONS OF THE POPULACE AND THE IMBECILES WHO ARE DELUDED BY FINE-SOUNDING PHRASES HAVE SO EMBITTERED NATIONAL FEUDS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF A WHOLE RACE WILL BE AT STAKE IN THE WAR OF THE MORROW
DEVOTING HIS LIFE TO WORKS OF THE FLESH A MAN BUSIES HIMSELF WITH ACTIONS DEPENDING ON TEMPORARY CAUSES OUTSIDE HIMSELF
BUT THE FATE OF GARRISON STILL MORE THAT OF BALLOU IN BEING COMPLETELY UNRECOGNIZED IN SPITE OF FIFTY YEARS OF OBSTINATE AND PERSISTENT WORK IN THE SAME DIRECTION CONFIRMED ME IN THE IDEA THAT THERE EXISTS A KIND OF TACIT BUT STEADFAST CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ABOUT ALL SUCH EFFORTS
SO THAT THE REFUTATION OF A BOOK WHICH NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WAS EVEN CHOSEN AS THE SUBJECT FOR THEOLOGICAL DISSERTATIONS IN THE ACADEMIES
AND IT IS A LIE AND A CALUMNY SO TRANSPARENT THAT THE ONLY WAY OF KEEPING IT UP CONSISTS IN OVERAWING PEOPLE BY THEIR EARNESTNESS THEIR CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
THAT MAY HAPPEN--OR IT MAY NOT HAPPEN
I WILL BEGIN WITH THE FIRST CLASS
MORGAN GIBBON FOR THEIR PULPIT ADDRESSES BEFORE THE CONGRESS AND ALSO TO THE AUTHORITIES OF ST PAUL'S CATHEDRAL THE CITY TEMPLE AND STAMFORD HILL CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH FOR THE USE OF THOSE BUILDINGS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES
THIS INCIDENT OCCURS IN A PROVINCIAL TOWN
IT CONSISTS IN PLUNDERING THE INDUSTRIOUS WORKING PEOPLE OF THEIR WEALTH BY MEANS OF TAXES AND DISTRIBUTING IT IN SATISFYING THE GREED OF OFFICIALS WHO ARE BOUND IN RETURN TO SUPPORT AND KEEP UP THE OPPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE
THEY BECOME LESS CRUEL AND SO CANNOT MAINTAIN THEIR POSITION AND ARE EXPELLED FROM POWER BY OTHERS LESS CHRISTIAN AND MORE WICKED
THE POLICE CLEAR A WAY FOR HIM THROUGH THE CROWD
TRANSCRIBIST'S NOTE
TRANSCRIBIST'S NOTE
THE TRUE THE RATIONAL LIFE IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR MAN ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE IN WHICH HE CAN PARTICIPATE NOT IN THE FAMILY OR THE STATE BUT IN THE SOURCE OF LIFE--THE FATHER
AND THE MOST MELANCHOLY THING IS THAT ONE CAN FORESEE NO LIMIT TO THIS AUGMENTATION OF THE BUDGET AND IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE MASSES
15
FLOG AND KILL STARVING MEN BECAUSE THEY WON'T LET THEIR LAST POSSESSION BE STOLEN FROM THEM WITHOUT RESISTANCE THAT WE WON'T ALLOW BUT FAR FROM ANYONE DOING THIS THE MAJORITY EVEN OF THOSE WHO WERE THE CAUSE OF THE AFFAIR SUCH AS THE COMMISSIONER THE LANDOWNER THE JUDGE AND THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN IT AND ARRANGED IT AS THE GOVERNOR THE MINISTERS AND THE TZAR ARE PERFECTLY TRANQUIL AND DO NOT EVEN FEEL A PRICK OF CONSCIENCE
AND WILL NOT THIS PRESUMPTION BE TRANSFORMED INTO CERTAINTY IF WE RECOGNIZE IN THE DOCTRINE UNIVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE CHURCH THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF ONE OF THE RELIGIONS OF THE PAST
DEAR SIR HE WRITES TO THE EDITOR OF THE REVUE DES REVUES
WHAT IS DONE BY THE CHURCHES AMONG US AMONG THE CATHOLICS AND THE PROTESTANTS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS--WHAT IS THEIR PRACTICAL WORK
JUST AS THE MECHANICIAN WHO IS NOT FREE TO MODIFY THE MOVEMENT OF HIS LOCOMOTIVE WHEN IT IS IN MOTION IS FREE TO REGULATE THE MACHINE BEFOREHAND SO AS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE MOVEMENT IS TO BE
IF TWO TEN A HUNDRED MEN DO SO THEY TOO ARE MURDERERS
IN OTHER RESPECTS THEY ARE OFTEN GOOD AND KIND-HEARTED MEN AND THEY ARE MORE ABLE TO TAKE PART IN SUCH DOINGS BECAUSE THEIR SHARE IN THEM IS LIMITED TO SUGGESTIONS DECISIONS AND ORDERS
AND APPARENTLY ALL THE MEN WHO ARE GOING TO CARRY OUT THIS CRIME ARE EQUALLY UNDISTURBED
ANNA DOLLY JOHN PETER AND SO ON
BUT ONE NO LONGER WONDERS WHEN ONE REALIZES THAT IN THE HIGHER CLASSES THERE IS AN UNERRING INSTINCT OF WHAT TENDS TO MAINTAIN AND OF WHAT TENDS TO DESTROY THE ORGANIZATION BY VIRTUE OF WHICH THEY ENJOY THEIR PRIVILEGES
PROVIDE YOURSELVES BAGS WHICH WAX NOT OLD A TREASURE IN THE HEAVENS THAT FAILETH NOT WHERE NO THIEF APPROACHETH NEITHER MOTH CORRUPTETH
14
SINCE EVEN SUPPORTED BY THE USE OF FORCE WE CAN HARDLY CONTROL THE NON-CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS WHICH ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUR DOWN ON US AND TO DESTROY ALL THAT HAS BEEN GAINED BY CIVILIZATION IS IT LIKELY THAT PUBLIC OPINION COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF FORCE AND RENDER US SECURE
LIFE IS A VALUE WHICH HAS NO WEIGHT NOR SIZE AND CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER AND SO THERE IS NO SENSE IN DESTROYING A LIFE FOR A LIFE
AND MORE THAN THAT THIS FREEDOM IS THE SOLE MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING THE DIVINE WORK OF THE LIFE OF THE WORLD
IT IS THE ESSENTIAL FACULTY OF THE HUMAN SOUL
THE DESIRE OF THE EDUCATED CLASSES TO SUPPORT THE IDEAS THEY PREFER AND THE ORDER OF EXISTENCE BASED ON THEM HAS ATTAINED ITS FURTHEST LIMITS
REPRESENTATIVES OF GOVERNMENTS PRIVATE PERSONS AND OFFICIAL ORGANS SAY THE SAME THING
AND THUS IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS THAT THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD DESCEND AT PENTECOST IN TONGUES OF FIRE UPON THOSE WHO MADE THIS ASSERTION
BUT WE KNOW ALL THE WHILE THAT GRANTING SUCH A RIGHT TO CERTAIN PERSONS DOES NOT DECIDE THE QUESTION STILL LESS SO WHEN WE ARE OURSELVES THE CERTAIN PERSONS SINCE THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO DO NOT RECOGNIZE THIS RIGHT IN THE AUTHORIZED PERSONS OR ASSEMBLIES
THE MAN WHO LOVES HIS TRIBE AND TAKES PRIDE IN IT KNOWS THAT HE LOVES ALL THE GUELPHS OR ALL THE GHIBELLINES
IF HE DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD THE CART WILL KNOCK HIM DOWN AND GO ON DRAGGING HIM WITH IT WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO TO THIS QUESTION CHRIST ANSWERED THAT THE END OF THE WORLD THAT IS OF THE PAGAN ORGANIZATION OF LIFE SHALL COME WHEN THE TRIBULATION OF MEN IS GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN AND WHEN THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD THAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW ORGANIZATION OF LIFE SHALL BE PREACHED IN THE WORLD UNTO ALL NATIONS
IT ATTACKS SOVEREIGNS AND FORCES THEM TO MAINTAIN AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF ARMED MEN
HOMYAKOV ASSERTS THAT A CHURCH IS A COLLECTION OF MEN ALL WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF CLERGY AND LAYMEN UNITED TOGETHER BY LOVE AND THAT ONLY TO MEN UNITED BY LOVE IS THE TRUTH REVEALED LET US LOVE EACH OTHER THAT IN THE UNITY OF THOUGHT ETC AND THAT SUCH A CHURCH IS THE CHURCH WHICH IN THE FIRST PLACE RECOGNIZES THE NICENE CREED AND IN THE SECOND PLACE DOES NOT AFTER THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCHES RECOGNIZE THE POPES AND NEW DOGMAS
AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE SENTIMENT TO THE STATE IS THE FURTHEST LIMIT WHICH THE PROCESS CAN REACH
AND SO MODERN MEN CANNOT BELIEVE THAT OBEDIENCE TO CIVIC OR POLITICAL LAWS CAN SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF THE REASON OR OF HUMAN NATURE
IN FORMER DAYS IF A MAN WERE TOLD THAT IF HE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE HE WOULD BE EXPOSED TO ATTACK FROM ENEMIES DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO RESIST THEM ALONE AND WOULD BE LIABLE TO BE KILLED AND THAT THEREFORE IT WOULD BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE TO PUT UP WITH SOME HARDSHIPS TO SECURE HIMSELF FROM THESE CALAMITIES HE MIGHT WELL BELIEVE IT SEEING THAT THE SACRIFICES HE MADE TO THE STATE WERE ONLY PARTIAL AND GAVE HIM THE HOPE OF A TRANQUIL EXISTENCE IN A PERMANENT STATE
THEY ARE MADE TO WORK OFF THEIR TERM OF SERVICE IN LABOR IN THE FORESTS
AND THEY ACTED ACCORDINGLY EACH OF THE COMBATANTS TRYING TO CONVINCE HIMSELF AND OTHERS THAT WHAT EACH RESPECTIVELY REGARDS AS EVIL IS ACTUALLY ABSOLUTELY EVIL
MEN MIGHT WELL OBSERVE THE LAWS IF THEY BELIEVED THE TZARS WHO MADE THEM WERE GOD'S ANOINTED OR EVEN IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE THE WORK OF ASSEMBLIES OF LAWGIVERS WHO HAD THE POWER AND THE DESIRE TO MAKE THEM AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
ON THE CONTRARY HAVING THE POWER TO DO SO AT THEIR DISPOSAL THEY ARE MORE DISPOSED THAN OTHERS TO SUBORDINATE THE PUBLIC INTERESTS TO THEIR OWN
IF HE HAS SEIZED OUR COAT WE SHALL SURRENDER HIM OUR CLOAK ALSO RATHER THAN SUBJECT HIM TO PUNISHMENT
EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY IS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF TAKING PART IN THE CRUELTIES OF PAGAN LIFE OR OF REFUSING ALL PARTICIPATION IN THEM
AND THUS MORE CONFIDENCE IS AROUSED IN THE REMAINDER WHO ARE AT A LESS ADVANCED STAGE OF CAPACITY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE TRUTH
TRUTH NOT ONLY POINTS OUT THE WAY ALONG WHICH HUMAN LIFE OUGHT TO MOVE BUT REVEALS ALSO THE ONLY WAY ALONG WHICH IT CAN MOVE
THAT THE VERY IDEA OF LIVING WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT IS A BLASPHEMY WHICH ONE HARDLY DARE PUT INTO WORDS
TOLSTOI'S STYLE IN HIS RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS DIFFERS CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT OF HIS NOVELS
THEY HAVE BEEN MUCH TALKED ABOUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS WORK BUT AS TOLSTOI HIMSELF COMPLAINS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN SERIOUSLY DISCUSSED
FOURTHLY COME AT A CERTAIN TIME TO THE LAW COURTS AND TAKE YOUR SHARE IN THOSE SENSELESS CRUELTIES WHICH WE PERPETRATE ON SINNERS AND THOSE WHOM WE HAVE CORRUPTED IN THE SHAPE OF PENAL SERVITUDE EXILE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND DEATH
EVERY ATTEMPT AT THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS OF LABOR LAND POLITICS AND RELIGION MEETS WITH DIRECT OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF GOVERNMENT
WHAT WILL BECOME OF HUMAN SOCIETY WHEN THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS IS AT AN END
THIS SUPPOSITION CANNOT BE MADE BECAUSE THE PERFECTION HELD UP TO CHRISTIANS IS INFINITE AND CAN NEVER BE ATTAINED
ALL THIS IS NECESSARY TO PURIFY THE CHILD AND TO MAKE HIM A CHRISTIAN
SUCH ARE THE QUESTIONS BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE PEACE CONGRESS SHORTLY TO BE HELD IN ROME AND THE PUBLICATION OF A PAMPHLET SUR LE DESARMEMENT IT IS UNHAPPILY BEYOND DOUBT THAT WITH THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF THE MAJORITY OF EUROPEAN STATES ISOLATED FROM ONE ANOTHER AND GUIDED BY DISTINCT INTERESTS THE ABSOLUTE SUPPRESSION OF WAR IS AN ILLUSION WITH WHICH IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO CHEAT OURSELVES
46
ONLY THERE ARE NO MOTIVES TO LEAD MEN TO DO THIS
HE DOES NOT AS OTHERS DO DENY THE MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES NOT DRAW FROM THIS ADMISSION THE INEVITABLE DEDUCTIONS WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES SPONTANEOUSLY IN OUR LIFE WHEN WE UNDERSTAND CHRIST'S TEACHING IN THAT WAY
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT PEOPLES LASTING THROUGH THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND ENDING WITH THE HISTORY OF ROME IS THE HISTORY OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE ANIMAL PERSONAL VIEW OF LIFE TO THE SOCIAL VIEW OF LIFE
THE PREACHERS OF THE CHURCH CLEARLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT
THE PEASANT ATTEMPTED TO SUPPLICATE FOR MERCY BUT SEEING IT WAS USELESS HE CROSSED HIMSELF AND LAY DOWN
SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE RUSSIAN CRITICS

I TAKE A STIPEND AS PRIEST OR BISHOP FOR DECEIVING MEN IN THE MATTER OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO THEM
BESIDES APOLOGIES FOR VIOLENCE USED AGAINST ONE'S NEIGHBOR IN DEFENSE OF ANOTHER NEIGHBOR FROM GREATER VIOLENCE ARE ALWAYS UNTRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE WHEN FORCE IS USED AGAINST ONE WHO HAS NOT YET CARRIED OUT HIS EVIL INTENT I CAN NEVER KNOW WHICH WOULD BE GREATER--THE EVIL OF MY ACT OF VIOLENCE OR OF THE ACT I WANT TO PREVENT
TRUMPETS DRUMS SONGS FLAGS COSTUMES MARCHING DANCING TEARS AND DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES
THE KINGDOM OF GOD COMETH NOT WITH OUTWARD SHOW
THE CATECHISMS OF THE CHURCHES OF THE MOST WORLD-WIDE INFLUENCE--THE CATHOLIC THE OLD ORTHODOX AND THE LUTHERAN--OPENLY ASSERT THIS
FOREIGN CRITICS STARTED FROM THE SAME PREMISES BUT THEIR DISCUSSIONS OF MY BOOK WERE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF RUSSIAN CRITICS NOT ONLY IN BEING LESS BITTER AND IN SHOWING MORE CULTURE BUT EVEN IN THE SUBJECT-MATTER
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRISTIAN TRUTHS IN EACH INDIVIDUAL MAN--THE LEADING MEN OF MODERN TIMES HOWEVER DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO PREACH OR PRACTICE THE TRUTHS OF CHRISTIANITY BUT REGARD THE MODIFICATION OF THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE WITHIN THE LIMIT IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENTS AS SUFFICIENT TO REFORM THE LIFE OF HUMANITY--ON THIS SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF HYPOCRISY WHICH HAS REPLACED THE HYPOCRISY OF RELIGION MEN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES BASE THEIR JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR POSITION--THROUGH THIS HYPOCRISY THEY CAN ENJOY THE EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES OF THEIR POSITION BY FORCE AND FRAUD AND STILL PRETEND TO BE CHRISTIANS TO ONE ANOTHER AND BE EASY IN THEIR MINDS--THIS HYPOCRISY ALLOWS MEN WHO PREACH CHRISTIANITY TO TAKE PART IN INSTITUTIONS BASED ON VIOLENCE--NO EXTERNAL REFORMATION OF LIFE WILL RENDER IT LESS MISERABLE--ITS MISERY THE RESULT OF DISUNION CAUSED BY FOLLOWING LIES NOT THE TRUTH--UNION ONLY POSSIBLE IN TRUTH--HYPOCRISY HINDERS THIS
THE FIRST AND OLDEST METHOD IS INTIMIDATION
IN REALITY IT LOOKS AS IF EACH OF THE GREAT POWERS WERE EVERY INSTANT ANTICIPATING AN ATTACK ON THE PART OF THE OTHERS
AND THAT IS NOT ALL
IN PROTESTANTISM THIS TENDENCY IS SPECIALLY REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT THE EXCUSE OF ANTIQUITY
THE CHRISTIAN ACCORDING TO HELCHITSKY'S REASONING NOT ONLY CANNOT BE A RULER OR A SOLDIER
IF BY SOME IMPOSSIBLE CHANCE A FRACTION OF HUMAN SOCIETY--ALL THE CIVILIZED WEST LET US SUPPOSE--WERE TO SUCCEED IN SUSPENDING THE ACTION OF THIS LAW SOME RACES OF STRONGER INSTINCTS WOULD UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF PUTTING IT INTO ACTION AGAINST US
AND WHAT NEED IS THERE OF THEM WHEN THERE IS NO WAR AND NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE WAR
AND THIS IS JUST WHAT THEY DO
IN THE SPHERE OF POLITICAL ECONOMY A THEORY IS PROPOUNDED WHICH AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT THE WORSE THINGS ARE THE BETTER THEY ARE
THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF LIFE HAS EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE JEWISH AND HEATHEN AND THE HEATHEN AND JEWISH VIEW OF LIFE HAS TOO EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE CHRISTIAN
JUST AS ONE MIGHT FANCY THE FIRST LEAVES ON THE BUDDING TREES IN APRIL WERE EXCEPTIONAL IF WE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY ALL HAVE A COMMON CAUSE THE SPRING AND THAT IF WE SEE THE BRANCHES ON SOME TREES SHOOTING AND TURNING GREEN IT IS CERTAIN THAT IT WILL SOON BE SO WITH ALL
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SOCIAL SCALE SOLDIERS ARMED WITH GUNS PISTOLS AND SABERS INJURE AND MURDER PEOPLE AND COMPEL MEN THROUGH THESE MEANS TO ENTER THE ARMY AND ARE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS RESTS SOLELY ON THE OFFICERS WHO COMMAND THEM
IN THE MIDST OF THE ELABORATE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF JUDAISM IN WHICH IN THE WORDS OF ISAIAH LAW WAS LAID UPON LAW AND IN THE MIDST OF THE ROMAN LEGAL SYSTEM WORKED OUT TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF PERFECTION A NEW DOCTRINE APPEARED WHICH DENIED NOT ONLY EVERY DEITY AND ALL FEAR AND WORSHIP OF THEM BUT EVEN ALL HUMAN INSTITUTIONS AND ALL NECESSITY FOR THEM
THEIR EFFORTS ONLY AFFORD A PLAUSIBLE PRETEXT FOR GOVERNMENT TO STRENGTHEN THEIR POWER
IN FACT TAKE ANY MAN OF THE PRESENT TIME WHATEVER I DON'T MEAN A TRUE CHRISTIAN BUT AN AVERAGE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY EDUCATED OR UNEDUCATED BELIEVING OR UNBELIEVING RICH OR POOR MARRIED OR UNMARRIED
OR THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT WE ONLY POSSESS ALL THAT WE DO POSSESS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED AND IS DEFENDED FOR US BY MURDER AND VIOLENCE
THERE WAS ONE ROAD NOW THERE ARE TWO AND HE MUST MAKE HIS CHOICE
BUT HOW ARE WE TO CAST OFF THE VISIBLE TANGIBLE PROTECTION OF AN ARMED POLICEMAN AND TRUST TO SOMETHING SO INTANGIBLE AS PUBLIC OPINION
IT HAS BEEN ONLY BY A SUCCESSION OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ERRORS PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS OF GENERATIONS THAT THE MEANING OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE HAS GROWN CONTINUALLY MORE AND MORE CLEAR TO MEN
HOWEVER ONE MAN OR A THOUSAND MEN FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO OPPOSE EVIL BY EVIL ARE FAR MORE FREE FROM DANGER BY VIOLENCE THAN THOSE WHO RESORT TO VIOLENCE WHETHER AMONG CIVILIZED OR SAVAGE NEIGHBORS
THE CLERGY PREACH TOLERANCE AND EVEN SOMETIMES CONDEMN THE USE OF FORCE AND THE MORE EDUCATED AMONG THEM TRY IN THEIR SERMONS TO AVOID THE VERY DECEPTION WHICH IS THE BASIS OF THEIR POSITION AND WHICH IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SUPPORT
AND THIS INDEPENDENCE IS GAINED NOT BY MEANS OF STRIFE NOT BY THE DESTRUCTION OF EXISTING FORMS OF LIFE BUT ONLY BY A CHANGE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF LIFE
AND SINCE IT IS THAT MOST BENEFICIAL TO GOVERNMENTS IT IS ALSO THE MOST ENCOURAGED BY ALL INTELLIGENT GOVERNMENTS
WHEN I THINK ONLY OF THIS WORD WAR A KIND OF TERROR SEIZES UPON ME AS THOUGH I WERE LISTENING TO SOME TALE OF SORCERY OF THE INQUISITION SOME LONG PAST REMOTE ABOMINATION MONSTROUS UNNATURAL
BUT FOR A CHRISTIAN WHO SINCERELY BELIEVES THAT FOLLOWING CHRIST'S TEACHING WILL GIVE HIM SALVATION SUCH CONSIDERATIONS OF STATE CAN HAVE NO FORCE FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LABORS OF THE QUAKERS AND THEIR WORKS--WITH FOX PENN AND ESPECIALLY THE WORK OF DYMOND PUBLISHED IN 1827)--SHOWED ME NOT ONLY THAT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RECONCILING CHRISTIANITY WITH FORCE AND WAR HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED LONG LONG AGO BUT THAT THIS IRRECONCILABILITY HAD BEEN LONG AGO PROVED SO CLEARLY AND SO INDUBITABLY THAT ONE COULD ONLY WONDER HOW THIS IMPOSSIBLE RECONCILIATION OF CHRISTIAN TEACHING WITH THE USE OF FORCE WHICH HAS BEEN AND IS STILL PREACHED IN THE CHURCHES COULD HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED IN SPITE OF IT
HE MAY IF HE IS VERY LUCKY BE PUT IN COMMAND OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS AS BRUTALIZED AS HIMSELF
THE SON OF WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON THE FAMOUS CHAMPION OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE NEGROES WROTE TO ME THAT HE HAD READ MY BOOK IN WHICH HE FOUND IDEAS SIMILAR TO THOSE EXPRESSED BY HIS FATHER IN THE YEAR 1838 AND THAT THINKING IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ME TO KNOW THIS HE SENT ME A DECLARATION OR PROCLAMATION OF NON-RESISTANCE DRAWN UP BY HIS FATHER NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO
WHAT FORCES THESE PEASANTS TAKEN ONLY YESTERDAY FROM THE PLOW AND DRESSED IN UGLY AND UNSEEMLY COSTUMES WITH BLUE COLLARS AND GILT BUTTONS TO GO WITH GUNS AND SABERS AND MURDER THEIR FAMISHING FATHERS AND BROTHERS
ONE NEED NOT FORSAKE WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT ONE MUST NOT GIVE TOO GREAT A PLACE TO THEM IN ONE'S HEART AND SO ON
IN ANCIENT TIMES TYRANTS GOT CREDIT FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMITTED BUT IN OUR DAY THE MOST ATROCIOUS INFAMIES INCONCEIVABLE UNDER THE NEROS ARE PERPETRATED AND NO ONE GETS BLAMED FOR THEM
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MEN WHO SET OUT WITH THE OBJECT OF MURDER AND VIOLENCE TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE DID NOT RETURN TILL THEY HAD CARRIED OUT THEIR OBJECT AND THEN UNTROUBLED BY DOUBTS OR SCRUPLES HAVING CALMLY FLOGGED MEN TO DEATH THEY RETURNED HOME AND CARESSED THEIR CHILDREN LAUGHED AMUSED THEMSELVES AND ENJOYED THE PEACEFUL PLEASURES OF FAMILY LIFE
TO COMPEL THE LOWER CLASSES WHICH ARE MORE NUMEROUS TO OPPRESS AND ILL TREAT THEMSELVES EVEN AT THE COST OF ACTIONS OPPOSED TO THEIR CONSCIENCE IT WAS NECESSARY TO DECEIVE THEM
MAN AGAINST MAN FAMILY AGAINST FAMILY TRIBE AGAINST TRIBE RACE AGAINST RACE AND PEOPLE AGAINST PEOPLE
WHILE BELIEVERS WERE AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES AND THE BODY WAS ONE IT HAD NO NEED TO DECLARE ITSELF AS A CHURCH
IT IS AS THOUGH A MAN LIVING IN AN OLD HOUSE AND SUFFERING FROM COLD AND ALL SORTS OF INCONVENIENCE IN IT KNOWING TOO THAT IT IS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO PIECES SHOULD CONSENT TO ITS BEING REBUILT BUT ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO LEAVE IT
THE DOGMA THAT ALL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD ARE APPROVINGLY ORDAINED OF GOD AND THAT THE POWERS THAT BE IN THE UNITED STATES IN RUSSIA IN TURKEY ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WILL IS NO LESS ABSURD THAN IMPIOUS
HE CANNOT MAKE USE OF A DEADLY WEAPON
THE DECISIONS OF THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES ARE CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY MEANS OF MURDER OR TORTURE OR THREATS OF ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY OFFER RESISTANCE OR NOT
DIRECTLY HE PUTS OUT THE CONFLAGRATION IN ONE PLACE IT IS ALIGHT IN TWO OTHER PLACES
JUST AS THE INDIVIDUAL MAN VERY RARELY CHANGES HIS WAY OF LIFE AT THE DICTATES OF HIS REASON ALONE BUT GENERALLY CONTINUES TO LIVE AS BEFORE IN SPITE OF THE NEW INTERESTS AND AIMS REVEALED TO HIM BY HIS REASON AND ONLY ALTERS HIS WAY OF LIVING WHEN IT HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO HIS CONSCIENCE AND CONSEQUENTLY INTOLERABLE TO HIM
AND TURNING ROUND HE CONTINUED HIS DISCOURSE
THE COMMAND AGAINST FORNICATION THEY DO REALLY RECOGNIZE AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY DO NOT ADMIT THAT IN ANY CASE FORNICATION CAN CEASE TO BE WRONG
THAT IS WHY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER ARE WRONG IN ARGUING THAT SINCE ONLY A SMALL SECTION OF MANKIND HAS PASSED OVER TO CHRISTIANITY IN EIGHTEEN CENTURIES IT MUST BE MANY TIMES EIGHTEEN CENTURIES BEFORE ALL THE REMAINDER DO THE SAME
NO EXTERNAL CONDITIONS CAN GUARANTEE OUR LIFE WHICH IS ATTENDED WITH INEVITABLE SUFFERINGS AND INFALLIBLY TERMINATED BY DEATH AND WHICH CONSEQUENTLY CAN HAVE NO SIGNIFICANCE EXCEPT IN THE CONSTANT ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHAT IS DEMANDED BY THE POWER WHICH HAS PLACED US IN LIFE WITH A SOLE CERTAIN GUIDE--THE RATIONAL CONSCIENCE
THE SAVAGE RECOGNIZES LIFE ONLY IN HIMSELF AND HIS PERSONAL DESIRES
NO ATTENTION IS PAID TO HIS ARGUMENTS AND HE IS AGAIN REQUESTED TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDER BUT HE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH IT
ONE SET OF MEN COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE NO LONGER ON THE PRETEXT OF RESISTANCE TO EVIL BUT SIMPLY FOR THEIR PROFIT OR THEIR CAPRICE AND ANOTHER SET SUBMIT TO VIOLENCE NOT BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSE AS WAS SUPPOSED IN FORMER TIMES THAT THIS VIOLENCE WAS PRACTISED UPON THEM FOR THE SAKE OF SECURING THEM FROM EVIL BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AVOID IT
AND THE MORE THIS COMBINATION APPROACHES TO THE DIVINE LIFE THE MORE LIFE THERE IS IN IT
ALL THESE PROPOSITIONS ELABORATED BY MEN OF THE FOURTH CENTURY HAD A CERTAIN MEANING FOR MEN OF THAT TIME BUT FOR MEN OF TO-DAY THEY HAVE NO MEANING WHATEVER
HOMYAKOV'S DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SOME FAVOR AMONG RUSSIANS DOES NOT IMPROVE MATTERS IF WE ARE TO AGREE WITH HOMYAKOV IN CONSIDERING THE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH AS THE ONE TRUE CHURCH
AND ALSO FROM THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT IN THESE DAYS JUSTIFY THEIR POSITION BY ANY MYSTIC AND EXCEPTIONAL VIEWS AS IN FORMER TIMES DO NOT ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH ANY SUPERSTITIOUS OR FANATIC RITES LIKE THE SECTS WHO PRACTICE SELF-IMMOLATION BY FIRE OR THE WANDERING PILGRIMS BUT PUT THEIR REFUSAL ON THE VERY SIMPLEST AND CLEAREST GROUNDS COMPREHENSIBLE TO ALL AND RECOGNIZED AS TRUE BY ALL
AT THE SAME TIME GOVERNMENTS ARE INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF THEIR ARMIES EVERY YEAR LEVYING FRESH TAXES RAISING LOANS AND LEAVING AS A BEQUEST TO FUTURE GENERATIONS THE DUTY OF REPAIRING THE BLUNDERS OF THE SENSELESS POLICY OF THE PRESENT
THE SAME PRIESTS AND ARCHBISHOPS AND CHURCHES AND SYNODS BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THEY HAVE LONG AGO CEASED TO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY PREACH AND THEREFORE THEY CAN CONVINCE NO ONE OF THE NECESSITY OF BELIEVING WHAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEMSELVES
RESIST EVIL IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS NOW REGARDED AS RIGHT BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO AVOID IT--THE DIFFICULTY OF AVOIDING IT IS THE RESULT OF THE SUBTLE AND COMPLEX CHARACTER OF THE GOVERNMENT USE OF FORCE--FORCE IS USED IN FOUR WAYS
CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MEN OF SCIENCE
IN THE NAME OF EQUALITY TO ACCEPT THE CRUDEST MOST SENSELESS DIVISION OF MEN BY EXTERNALS MERELY INTO HIGHER AND LOWER CLASSES ALLIES AND ENEMIES
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY ARE RUBBED WITH OIL AND THE HAIR IS CUT WHILE THE SPONSORS BLOW AND SPIT AT AN IMAGINARY DEVIL
THOSE WHOM THEY REGARD AS THE RINGLEADERS THEY TAKE TO THE TOWN HALL AND HAVE THEM TRIED BY A SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL
SUCH A MAN IS GOING HIS WAY PEACEABLY WHEN SUDDENLY PEOPLE COME AND SAY TO HIM
INSTEAD OF TRANSFORMING THEIR LIFE INTO HARMONY WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE THEY TRY BY EVERY MEANS TO STIFLE ITS VOICE
AND 2 THE TRANSITORINESS OF ALL OUR WORKS WHICH SO SOON PASS AWAY AND LEAVE NO TRACE
WHATEVER THEY DO TO HIM HOWEVER THEY TORTURE OR HUMILIATE HIM HE WILL SUBMIT FOR ALONE HE CAN DO NOTHING
OR THAT IF YOU ARE TZAR MINISTER OFFICIAL JUDGE OR GENERAL YOU ARE BOUND TO RENOUNCE IMMEDIATELY THE ADVANTAGES OF YOUR POSITION
THEY REFUSE TO TAKE PART IN TRIALS AT LAW BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER EVERY APPEAL TO LAW IS FULFILLING THE LAW OF VENGEANCE WHICH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CHRISTIAN LAW OF FORGIVENESS AND LOVE
BUT IN ANTIQUITY THE DUTIES INVOLVED BY SUCH ASSOCIATION WERE PRESENTED UNDER COVER OF THE SUPERNATURAL AND WERE CONFIRMED BY IT
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THESE INSANE WORDS WHICH OUTRAGE EVERYTHING A MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY HOLDS SACRED MUST ROUSE INDIGNATION
EVERYONE WHO GAINS A POSITION OF POWER HE HAS STRIVEN FOR EVERY GENERAL EVERY MINISTER EVERY MILLIONAIRE EVERY PETTY OFFICIAL WHO HAS GAINED THE PLACE HE HAS COVETED FOR TEN YEARS EVERY RICH PEASANT WHO HAS LAID BY SOME HUNDRED RUBLES PASSES THROUGH THIS UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS OF SOFTENING
L
L
AND IT IS AS MUCH THE DUTY OF ANYONE WHO GOVERNS TO AVOID WAR AS IT IS THE DUTY OF A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP TO AVOID SHIPWRECK
BUT ONE MAY AT LEAST BE SURE THAT HIS DESTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REGIME WILL BECOME A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WORK OF DISINTEGRATION AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION WHICH IS GOING ON AROUND US
THE CASE AWAKENS THE INTEREST AND EVEN THE SYMPATHY NOT ONLY OF OUTSIDERS BUT EVEN OF THE OFFICERS
THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE FEW WORKS ATTACKING OFFICIAL CHRISTIANITY WHICH HAS ESCAPED BEING BURNED
BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS OCCURRED AND THE SAME FATE HAS BEEN REPEATED WITH ALL THOSE WORKS
THE CONGRESS CONGRATULATES THE FRIENDS OF PEACE ON THE RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN CONFERENCE HELD AT WASHINGTON IN APRIL LAST BY WHICH IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT ARBITRATION SHOULD BE OBLIGATORY IN ALL CONTROVERSIES WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN EXCEPT ONLY THOSE WHICH MAY IMPERIL THE INDEPENDENCE OF ONE OF THE NATIONS INVOLVED
ON THE ZACASPIAN BORDER WHERE HE IS AGAIN REQUESTED TO GO ON GUARD FULLY ARMED HE AGAIN DECLINES TO OBEY
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE SO NEITHER THE FORMER NOR THE LATTER COULD FAIL TO SEE THE IRRATIONALITY OF THEIR CONDUCT IF THE COMPLEXITY OF GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION DID NOT OBSCURE THE UNNATURAL SENSELESSNESS OF THEIR ACTIONS
MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY HAVE COME INTO SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY CONDITION THEIR HEARTS ARE SO HARDENED THAT SEEING THEY SEE NOT HEARING THEY DO NOT HEAR AND UNDERSTAND NOT
THEY SHOOT AND HANG MEN BY HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OR MASSACRE MILLIONS IN WAR OR BREAK MEN'S HEARTS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND RUIN THEIR SOULS IN THE CORRUPTION OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE AND NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE
NOTHING CAN OBLIGE A MAN TO DO WHAT HE DOES NOT CHOOSE EXCEPT PHYSICAL FORCE OR THE THREAT OF IT THAT IS--DEPRIVATION OF FREEDOM BLOWS IMPRISONMENT OR THREATS--EASILY CARRIED OUT--OF SUCH PUNISHMENTS
HUMANITY HAS OUTGROWN ITS SOCIAL STAGE AND HAS ENTERED UPON A NEW PERIOD
AND IN ADDITION TO THIS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE INDIVIDUALS RENOUNCED THEIR PERSONAL ADVANTAGES IS EXPOSED AGAIN TO THE SAME RISKS OF INSECURITY AND LACK OF PERMANENCE AS THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF WAS IN PREVIOUS TIMES
33 THE SOLE MEANING OF LIFE IS TO SERVE HUMANITY BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHICH CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE RECOGNITION AND PROFESSION OF THE TRUTH BY EVERY MAN
TIFLIS OCTOBER 2 1818
IN ENTERING UPON THE GREAT WORK BEFORE US WE ARE NOT UNMINDFUL THAT IN ITS PROSECUTION WE MAY BE CALLED TO TEST OUR SINCERITY EVEN AS IN A FIERY ORDEAL
TO STAND STILL IN ANY CONDITION WHATEVER MEANS THE CESSATION OF THIS BLESSEDNESS
IT IS THE SAME WITH THE LIFE OF HUMANITY
WHAT A CONTRAST WITH THE CONFIDENT AIR THEY ALL PUT ON AS THEY SAUNTERED ABOUT THE STATION AND PLATFORM
BUT WHEN I SAID THIS DISTINCTION WAS NOT MADE IN THE LAW OF GOD AND REMINDED THEM OF THE CHRISTIAN DUTY OF FRATERNITY FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES AND LOVE WHICH COULD NOT BE RECONCILED WITH MURDER THE PEASANTS USUALLY AGREED BUT IN THEIR TURN BEGAN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS
52 PETER WAS NOT DEFENDING HIMSELF BUT HIS BELOVED AND HEAVENLY MASTER
IT IS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THIS FALSE IDEA OF INEQUALITY AND THE INTOXICATION OF POWER AND OF SERVILITY RESULTING FROM IT THAT MEN ASSOCIATED IN A STATE ORGANIZATION ARE ENABLED TO COMMIT ACTS OPPOSED TO THEIR CONSCIENCE WITHOUT THE LEAST SCRUPLE OR REMORSE
THE PEOPLES WHO ACCEPTED IT IN ITS CORRUPT FORM WERE SUBJECTED TO ITS SLOW BUT CERTAIN INFLUENCE AND BY A LONG COURSE OF ERRORS AND EXPERIMENTS AND THEIR RESULTANT SUFFERINGS HAVE NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO THE NECESSITY OF ASSIMILATING IT IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE
THUS WE SEE A MAN OF PERFECT SANITY AND RIPE AGE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS DECKED OUT WITH SOME FRINGE OR EMBROIDERED KEYS ON HIS COAT TAILS OR A COLORED RIBBON ONLY FIT FOR SOME GAYLY DRESSED GIRL AND IS TOLD THAT HE IS A GENERAL A CHAMBERLAIN A KNIGHT OF THE ORDER OF ST ANDREW OR SOME SIMILAR NONSENSE SUDDENLY BECOME SELF-IMPORTANT PROUD AND EVEN HAPPY OR ON THE CONTRARY GROW MELANCHOLY AND UNHAPPY TO THE POINT OF FALLING ILL BECAUSE HE HAS FAILED TO OBTAIN THE EXPECTED DECORATION OR TITLE
THE EXISTING STATE ORGANIZATION--MEN USUALLY RENOUNCE ALL THEY HOLD SACRED AND SUBMIT TO THE DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT SEEMING TO SEE NO OTHER COURSE OPEN TO THEM--FOR MEN OF THE PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE THERE IS NO OTHER COURSE OPEN AND NEVER WILL BE IN SPITE OF THE GROWING HORRORS OF WAR--SOCIETY MADE UP OF SUCH MEN MUST PERISH AND NO SOCIAL REORGANIZATION CAN SAVE IT--PAGAN LIFE HAS REACHED ITS EXTREME LIMIT AND WILL ANNIHILATE ITSELF
I CAN NEVER PASS BY THE SPECTACLE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND THOSE WHICH PRECEDED IT IS THAT THE SOCIAL DOCTRINE SAID
ANOTHER WAS SAUNTERING BEFORE THE CARRIAGES OF OUR TRAIN STARING AT THE FACES OF THE WOMEN
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE TO LOVE GOD AND SERVE HIM AND ONLY AS A RESULT OF THAT LOVE TO LOVE AND SERVE ONE'S NEIGHBOR SEEMS TO SCIENTIFIC MEN OBSCURE MYSTIC AND ARBITRARY
WHY IS IT THAT NOT ONLY GOVERNMENTS BUT PRIVATE PERSONS OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TRY SO JEALOUSLY TO MAINTAIN THE IGNORANCE OF THE PEOPLE
IT WOULD INDEED BE AN EXCELLENT THING
YOU LOAD YOUR GUN AGAINST THIS MAN WHO IS TO PERISH FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD YOU IMPRISON HIM YOU TAKE HIS POSSESSIONS
THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MAN WHO REFUSES TO OBEY WILL CONSIST IN PRESERVING HIS DIGNITY AS A MAN GAINING THE APPROBATION OF GOOD MEN AND ABOVE ALL KNOWING THAT HE IS DOING THE WORK OF GOD AND SO UNDOUBTEDLY DOING GOOD TO HIS FELLOW-MEN
SO MUCH FOR THE THIRD METHOD
IT IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE AND ITS FALL WILL BRING IT ALL DOWN
THROUGH TRADITION HANDED DOWN BY EDUCATION AND SUPPORTED BY RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT COMPULSION MERGED THEIR INTERESTS IN THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP AND SACRIFICED THEIR OWN GOOD FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE
AS I SAID WHEN I PUBLISHED MY BOOK CHRIST'S TEACHING AND HIS VERY WORDS ABOUT NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL WERE FOR MANY YEARS A SUBJECT FOR RIDICULE AND LOW JESTING IN MY EYES AND CHURCHMEN FAR FROM OPPOSING IT EVEN ENCOURAGED THIS SCOFFING AT SACRED THINGS
SLAVERY WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THE MORAL PRINCIPLES ADVOCATED BY PLATO AND ARISTOTLE YET NEITHER OF THEM SAW THAT BECAUSE TO RENOUNCE SLAVERY WOULD HAVE MEANT THE BREAK UP OF THE LIFE THEY WERE LIVING
THOU SHALT NOT KILL I HAVE OFTEN INQUIRED OF DIFFERENT SOLDIERS
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THESE TWO RULING POWERS WERE CONSTANTLY AIDING ONE ANOTHER TO STRIVE FOR NOTHING BUT OUTWARD GLORY
CHRISTIANITY DOES NOT REQUIRE OF A MAN CERTAIN DEFINITE NEGATIVE ACTS BUT PUTS HIM IN A NEW DIFFERENT RELATION TO MEN FROM WHICH MAY RESULT THE MOST DIVERSE ACTS WHICH CANNOT BE DEFINED BEFOREHAND
IF WE DO NOT GO FORWARD WE MUST GO BACK
NOT ONLY CHRISTIANS BUT PAGANS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO ALL RECOGNIZED THE EVIL OF WAR AND THE BLESSING OF PEACE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
BUT IT IS NOT ONLY THESE MEN WHO ARE GOING BY TRAIN PREPARED FOR MURDER AND TORTURE
STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM TO US WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ERRONEOUS VIEW OF THE CHURCH AS A CHRISTIAN INSTITUTION AND IN CONTEMPT FOR HERESY YET THE FACT IS THAT ONLY IN WHAT WAS CALLED HERESY WAS THERE ANY TRUE MOVEMENT THAT IS TRUE CHRISTIANITY AND THAT IT ONLY CEASED TO BE SO WHEN THOSE HERESIES STOPPED SHORT IN THEIR MOVEMENT AND ALSO PETRIFIED INTO THE FIXED FORMS OF A CHURCH
HOW CAN MEN ALLOW THAT MURDER IS PERMISSIBLE WHILE THEY PREACH PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY AND HOW CAN THEY ALLOW OF THE EXISTENCE IN THEIR MIDST OF A MILITARY ORGANIZATION OF PHYSICAL FORCE WHICH IS A CONSTANT MENACE TO PUBLIC SECURITY?--IT IS ONLY ALLOWED BY THE UPPER CLASSES WHO PROFIT BY THIS ORGANIZATION BECAUSE THEIR PRIVILEGES ARE MAINTAINED BY IT--THE UPPER CLASSES ALLOW IT AND THE LOWER CLASSES CARRY IT INTO EFFECT IN SPITE OF THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE IMMORALITY OF THE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE THE MORE READILY BECAUSE THROUGH THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH DEEDS IS DIVIDED AMONG A GREAT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN IT AND EVERYONE THROWS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON SOMEONE ELSE--MOREOVER THE SENSE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS LOST THROUGH THE DELUSION OF INEQUALITY AND THE CONSEQUENT INTOXICATION OF POWER ON THE PART OF SUPERIORS AND SERVILITY ON THE PART OF INFERIORS--THE CONDITION OF THESE MEN ACTING AGAINST THE DICTATES OF THEIR CONSCIENCE IS
THE MINISTER THE TZAR AND ALL THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES ARE IN THE SAME POSITION
BUT THE PEASANTS THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SOCIAL SCALE WHO HAVE NO KIND OF ADVANTAGE FROM THE EXISTING ORDER WHO ARE IN THE VERY LOWEST POSITION OF SUBJECTION AND HUMILIATION WHAT FORCES THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE IN THEIR HUMBLE AND DISADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IS THE ORDER WHICH OUGHT TO EXIST AND WHICH THEY OUGHT TO SUPPORT EVEN AT THE COST OF EVIL ACTIONS CONTRARY TO THEIR CONSCIENCE
NEVERTHELESS THE MOMENT WILL COME WHEN WE SHALL BE FORCED TO GO TO WAR
THIS IS JUST WHAT THE MAN DID WHO TIED UP THE FULL-GROWN CHICKEN AND THRUST IT BACK INTO THE SHELL IT HAD COME OUT OF
AND THEREFORE JUST AS A BRIGAND CAUGHT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE ACT CANNOT PERSUADE US THAT HE DID NOT LIFT HIS KNIFE IN ORDER TO ROB HIS VICTIM OF HIS PURSE AND HAD NO THOUGHT OF KILLING HIM WE TOO IT WOULD SEEM CANNOT PERSUADE OURSELVES OR OTHERS THAT THE SOLDIERS AND POLICEMEN AROUND US ARE NOT TO GUARD US BUT ONLY FOR DEFENSE AGAINST FOREIGN FOES AND TO REGULATE TRAFFIC AND FETES AND REVIEWS
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS BUT I WILL NOT GIVE THE POOR THE BENEFIT OF MY EDUCATIONAL MEDICAL OR LITERARY LABORS EXCEPT FOR MONEY
AND THEREFORE EVEN IF WE ADMIT THAT THIS CHRISTIANIZING PROCESS WILL SOME DAY AFFECT EVERYONE STILL JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IT HAS MADE IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS IT WILL BE MANY TIMES EIGHTEEN CENTURIES BEFORE IT WILL DO SO
HAVING WITHDRAWN FROM HUMAN PROTECTION WHAT CAN SUSTAIN US BUT THAT FAITH WHICH OVERCOMES THE WORLD
OR HE SEEMS TO THEM TO HAVE SAID WHAT HE SAID IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND IN OTHER PLACES ACCIDENTALLY OR THROUGH HIS LACK OF INTELLIGENCE OR OF CULTIVATION
IT IS PRECISELY THE SAME WITH THE CHURCH
THE TREATMENT OF THIS SUBJECT BY THE LEARNED HISTORIAN OF CHRISTIANITY E
FEAR NOT THEM WHICH KILL THE BODY BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO KILL THE SOUL
ONE UNIFORM TYPE OF DOCTRINE HAS NOT YET BEEN ELABORATED
AS FOR THE ASSERTION THAT MEN ARE ILL TREATED AND MURDERED TO FORCE THEM TO WORK FOR THE PROFIT OF THE RICH THAT IS A SOPHISM
HYPOCRISY WHICH HAD FORMERLY ONLY A RELIGIOUS BASIS IN THE DOCTRINE OF ORIGINAL SIN THE REDEMPTION AND THE CHURCH HAS IN OUR DAY GAINED A NEW SCIENTIFIC BASIS AND HAS CONSEQUENTLY CAUGHT IN ITS NETS ALL THOSE WHO HAD REACHED TOO HIGH A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT TO BE ABLE TO FIND SUPPORT IN RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY
THE CHRISTIAN HAS IN NO CASE THE RIGHT TO PUT TO DEATH HIS NEIGHBOR WHO HAS DONE HIM EVIL OR TO DO HIM INJURY IN RETURN
THE AFFAIR CONTINUES TO ATTRACT MORE AND MORE ATTENTION BOTH AMONG THE SOLDIERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN
NO ONE HAS ASKED YOU TO UNDERTAKE THIS
BUT THE BLESSING OF PEACE IS SO WELL KNOWN TO MEN THAT EVER SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN MEN AT ALL THEIR BEST WISH HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE GREETING PEACE BE WITH YOU SO WHY PREACH ABOUT IT
OR IN IMPOUNDING THE COW FOUND ON ONE'S LAND THOUGH IT BELONGS TO A MAN WHO HAS NO LAND
AND ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD NOT THE MEN WHO IN THE DECLINE OF CHRISTIANITY RAISED THEMSELVES ABOVE ALL AND REGARDED THEMSELVES AS THE TEACHERS OF THE PUREST CHRISTIANITY WOULD NOT THESE VERY MEN IN THE TIMES OF THE APOSTLES AND DISCIPLES OF CHRIST HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS THE MOST SHAMELESS HERETICS AND ANTI-CHRISTIANS HE EXPOUNDS AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THESE QUESTIONS THE THEORY THAT ANY VERBAL EXPRESSION OF FAITH SUCH AS WAS DEMANDED BY THE CHURCH AND THE DEPARTURE FROM WHICH WAS RECKONED AS HERESY COULD NEVER FULLY COVER THE EXACT RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF A BELIEVER AND THAT THEREFORE THE DEMAND FOR AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH IN CERTAIN WORDS WAS EVER PRODUCTIVE OF HERESY AND HE SAYS IN QUESTION 21
THAT IS BE DIPPED BY THE PRIEST THREE TIMES INTO THE WATER WHILE CERTAIN WORDS UNDERSTOOD BY NO ONE ARE READ ALOUD AND CERTAIN ACTIONS STILL LESS UNDERSTOOD ARE PERFORMED
WAR HAS BEEN PUT ON ITS TRIAL
YET IT IS DENIED
CONSISTS IN DECLARING THAT THEY DO NOT DENY THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTING EVIL BUT RECOGNIZE IT
THIS CONTRADICTION WHICH IS A QUINTESSENCE OF ALL THE OTHER CONTRADICTIONS IS SO TERRIBLE THAT TO LIVE AND TO TAKE PART IN IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF ONE DOES NOT THINK OF IT--IF ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET IT
GOVERNORS POLICE OFFICIALS TAX COLLECTORS OFTEN HAVE COMPASSION ON THE PEOPLE AND TRY TO FIND PRETEXTS FOR NOT COLLECTING THE TAX FROM THEM
EIGHTEEN CENTURIES AGO CHRISTIANITY REVEALED TO MEN THE TRUTH IN WHICH THEY OUGHT TO LIVE AND AT THE SAME TIME FORETOLD WHAT HUMAN LIFE WOULD BECOME IF MEN WOULD NOT LIVE BY IT BUT CONTINUED TO LIVE BY THEIR PREVIOUS PRINCIPLES AND WHAT IT WOULD BECOME IF THEY ACCEPTED THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND CARRIED IT OUT IN THEIR LIVES
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN--PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY WHAT IS THIS STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE SUCH TERRIBLE SACRIFICES HAVE TO BE MADE
BUT BY THIS VERY ATTITUDE TO VIOLENCE HE WILL NOT ONLY HIMSELF BE FREE BUT WILL FREE THE WHOLE WORLD FROM ALL EXTERNAL POWER
ONE WOULD HAVE FANCIED IT OBVIOUS THAT A MAN WHOSE WHOLE OCCUPATION WAS BASED ON WHAT IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE IS CALLED SWINDLING IF IT IS DONE UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS POSITION AND COULD NOT ANY WAY WHILE HE CONTINUES A MERCHANT PROFESS HIMSELF A CHRISTIAN OR A LIBERAL
AND THEREFORE IT WOULD SEEM INEVITABLE FOR CHRISTIAN MEN TO ABANDON THE PAGAN FORMS OF SOCIETY WHICH THEY CONDEMN AND TO RECONSTRUCT THEIR SOCIAL EXISTENCE ON THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES THEY PROFESS
THE NATIONS ARE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF A CRIME CANNOT BE ITS EXTENUATION
THEY MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS MEN WHO TRYING TO SET A STEAM ENGINE IN MOTION SHOULD TURN ITS WHEELS ROUND WITH THEIR HANDS NOT SUSPECTING THAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ITS MOVEMENT WAS THE EXPANSION OF THE STEAM AND NOT THE MOTION OF THE WHEELS
THE CONGRESS EXPRESSES ITS HEARTY APPRECIATION OF THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY CONFERENCE HELD RECENTLY AT BRUSSELS FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLES OF AFRICA
THEN HE MUST GIVE OFFERINGS AND PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD AND LITTLE LOAVES TO BE CUT UP INTO THREE-CORNERED PIECES AND MUST PRAY MANY TIMES FOR THE HEALTH AND PROSPERITY OF THE TZAR AND THE BISHOPS AND FOR HIMSELF AND HIS OWN AFFAIRS AND THEN KISS THE CROSS AND THE HAND OF THE PRIEST
THEY TRANSFER HIM TO A DIVISION STATIONED ON THE ZACASPIAN BORDER AND IN COMPANY WITH CONVICTS SEND HIM TO A CHIEF OFFICER WHO IS NOTORIOUS FOR HIS HARSHNESS AND SEVERITY
WHY DO THEY DO IT
THE SOBS AND CRIES OF THE CROWD OF WOMEN GREW LOUDER AND MORE HEART-RENDING AND THE MEN'S FACES GREW DARKER AND DARKER
AND BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THEY HINDER TURN TO THEM AND REQUEST THEM NOT TO INTERFERE THEY FANCY THEY ARE VERY USEFUL INDEED
THEIR WAY OF THINKING AND ACTING IS WELL KNOWN
E REFRAINING FROM TAKING FROM THEM THE LAND NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUBSISTENCE
SIMPLY BECAUSE TORTURE AND MURDER ARE NOT EMPLOYED IN EVERY INSTANCE OF OPPRESSION BY FORCE THOSE WHO ENJOY THE EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES OF THE RULING CLASSES PERSUADE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THAT THEIR PRIVILEGES ARE NOT BASED ON TORTURE AND MURDER BUT ON SOME MYSTERIOUS GENERAL CAUSES ABSTRACT LAWS AND SO ON
KINGS AND EMPERORS SCARCELY GOVERN AT ALL
THAT YOU ARE GOVERNOR PROSECUTOR OR TZAR NOT BECAUSE IT IS AGREEABLE TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE USED TO IT BUT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
ALL OF US CHRISTIANS NOT ONLY PROFESS TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER BUT DO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE COMMON LIFE
WE NEED ONLY RECALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR WAR THE MITRAILLEUSES THE SILVER-GILT BULLETS THE TORPEDOES AND--THE RED CROSS
THAT THERE IS NOT AND CANNOT BE ANY REAL JUSTICE IN THEM
BUT THIS IS ONLY IN BARBAROUS RUSSIA THE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN READER WILL OBSERVE
WHAT WEALTH OF IDEA OF FORM OF COLOR WHAT ERUDITION WHAT ART BUT WHAT A LACK OF SERIOUS MATTER WHAT DREAD OF ANY EXACTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR EXPRESSION
I KNOW THAT I DO NOT NEED TO DIVIDE MYSELF OFF FROM OTHER NATIONS AND THEREFORE I CANNOT ADMIT THAT I BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO ANY STATE OR NATION OR THAT I OWE ALLEGIANCE TO ANY GOVERNMENT
THAT TAXES DUES SERFAGE PRISONS SCOURGING KNOUTS EXECUTIONS THE ARMY AND WAR WERE WHAT OUGHT TO BE--WE KNOW NOW THAT ONE CAN SELDOM FIND A MAN WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL THESE MEANS OF VIOLENCE PRESERVE ANYONE FROM ANY EVIL WHATEVER AND INDEED DOES NOT CLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT MOST OF THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO WHICH HE IS EXPOSED AND IN WHICH HE HAS SOME SHARE ARE IN THEMSELVES A GREAT AND USELESS EVIL
TILL LATELY THIS RELIGIOUS SCRUPLE SEEMED A VALID EXCUSE TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHO URGED IT WERE LET OFF SERVICE
WE RECOGNIZE BUT ONE KING AND LAWGIVER ONE JUDGE AND RULER OF MANKIND
THE GREATEST MANIFESTATION OF THIS CONTRADICTION CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT EVERY CITIZEN IN BEING MADE A SOLDIER BECOMES A PROP OF THE GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION AND SHARES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT DOES EVEN THOUGH HE MAY NOT ADMIT ITS LEGITIMACY
BUT INDEED ALL CHURCHES WITHOUT EXCEPTION AVAIL THEMSELVES OF EVERY MEANS FOR THE PURPOSE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS WHAT IS NOW CALLED HYPNOTISM
HIS DUTY IS HUMBLY BUT STEADFASTLY TO REFUSE TO SERVE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE REASONING ABOUT IT CONCLUDE STRAIGHTWAY THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT MEASURES RESTS ENTIRELY ON THOSE WHO RESOLVE ON THEM OR THAT THE GOVERNMENTS AND SOVEREIGNS DECIDE THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR THEIR SUBJECTS AND THE DUTY OF THE SUBJECTS IS MERELY TO OBEY
BUT DIRECTLY AFTER THEM AGAIN THE WORST COARSEST LEAST CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY RISE TO THE TOP AND ARE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME PROCESS AS THEIR PREDECESSORS AND AGAIN IN A GENERATION OR SO SEEING THE VANITY OF WHAT IS GAINED BY VIOLENCE AND HAVING IMBIBED CHRISTIANITY THEY COME DOWN AGAIN AMONG THE OPPRESSED AND THEIR PLACE IS AGAIN FILLED BY NEW OPPRESSORS LESS BRUTAL THAN FORMER OPPRESSORS THOUGH MORE SO THAN THOSE THEY OPPRESS
THAT COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE IS AS INEVITABLE AS DEATH AND THAT SINCE GOVERNMENT WILL ALWAYS DESIRE IT WAR WILL ALWAYS EXIST SO WRITES THIS TALENTED AND SINCERE WRITER WHO IS ENDOWED WITH THAT POWER OF PENETRATING TO THE INNERMOST CORE OF THE SUBJECTS WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF THE POETIC FACULTY
THE UTTERANCES OF NOAH MOSES AND THE OTHER PROPHETS IN WHICH THEY ADMIT THE RIGHT OF DOING BODILY HARM TO THOSE WHO INFLICT HARM SO AS TO PUNISH AND PREVENT EVIL DEEDS
THIS THEN IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE BELIEF OF THE LOWER CLASSES THAT THE EXISTING REGIME SO FATAL FOR THEM IS THE REGIME WHICH OUGHT TO EXIST AND WHICH THEY OUGHT THEREFORE TO SUPPORT EVEN BY TORTURE AND MURDER
ALL THAT ARE WORTH CALLING ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION CAN BE BROUGHT UNDER THE FOLLOWING FIVE HEADS
HE WANTS TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS BUT THEY HURRY HIM AND TELL HIM TO MAKE HASTE AND UNDRESS
TO KEEP THEIR SUBJECTS IN OPPRESSION AND TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR THE GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE ARMED FORCES
FOR FIFTY YEARS BALLOU WROTE AND PUBLISHED BOOKS DEALING PRINCIPALLY WITH THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
BY THEIR MARTYRDOM THEY PASSED ON THE TRUTH TO THE MASSES AND IMPRESSED IT ON THEIR HEARTS
THEY CAN NEVER HAVE PERSUADED THEMSELVES THAT THEY OUGHT TO DO WHAT IS AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE AND ALSO THE SOURCE OF MISERY AND RUIN FOR THEMSELVES AND ALL THEIR CLASS WHO MAKE UP NINE-TENTHS OF THE POPULATION
POWER SELECTS AND ATTRACTS THE WORST ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY TRANSFORMS THEM IMPROVES AND SOFTENS THEM AND RETURNS THEM TO SOCIETY
AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE MILLIONS OF THE LOWER CLASSES CAN FEEL EASY IN CONSCIENCE WHEN THEY COMMIT SUCH OBVIOUSLY EVIL DEEDS AS TORTURE AND MURDER FROM FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
NEW TAXES AND DUTIES ARE BEING DEVISED EVERYWHERE AND THE FINANCIAL OPPRESSION OF THE NATIONS KNOWS NO LIMITS
THEY DEVISE THE SUBTLEST MEANS FOR CHANGING THE POSITION WHICH IS IRKSOME TO THEM BUT NOT THAT SIMPLEST MEANS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM DOING WHAT LEADS TO THAT POSITION
MOREOVER HE CANNOT FEEL FULLY ASSURED THAT HIS SOLDIERS WILL AT THE LAST MOMENT OBEY HIM
IT MUST GROW LIKE A HUGE TREE FROM A TINY SEED
AND THE REASON OF THIS CONVICTION IS THAT THE FALSE INTERPRETATION AND CONSEQUENT MISAPPREHENSION OF THE GOSPEL IS AN ERROR OF SUCH LONG STANDING
WHILE THE PAGAN ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN PROVED MORE AND MORE FALSE THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION HAS BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE EVIDENT
WHENCE IS THE WORD NON-RESISTANCE DERIVED
AND IN THIS WAY IT SEEMS TO COUNTENANCE ALL THE MANIFESTATIONS OF COVETOUSNESS PROFLIGACY AND CRUELTY WHICH DO NOT COME UNDER ITS NARROW DEFINITION
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF UNDERTAKING ANY ENTERPRISE
AND VERY QUICKLY AFTER THE BOOK CRITICISMS BOTH RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR IN CHARACTER MADE THEIR APPEARANCE AND THESE THE GOVERNMENT TOLERATED AND EVEN ENCOURAGED
MEN OF ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL TIMES BELIEVED FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT MEN ARE NOT EQUAL THAT THE ONLY TRUE MEN ARE PERSIANS OR GREEKS OR ROMANS OR FRANKS
STILL LESS EFFECTIVE WILL BE THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GOVERNMENTS TO DISBAND THEIR ARMIES AND REPLACE THEM BY INTERNATIONAL BOARDS OF ARBITRATION
THEN THE MOST TRIFLING PRETEXT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO THROW THE WHOLE OF EUROPE INTO THE FIRE OF UNIVERSAL WAR
BUT WHAT ARE GOVERNMENTS TO DO AGAINST MEN WHO SHOW THE USELESSNESS SUPERFLUOUSNESS AND PERNICIOUSNESS OF ALL GOVERNMENTS AND WHO DO NOT CONTEND AGAINST THEM BUT SIMPLY DO NOT NEED THEM AND DO WITHOUT THEM AND THEREFORE ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE ANY PART IN THEM
AND THEY WOULD BE PERFECTLY RIGHT IF MAN WERE A CREATURE WITHOUT CONSCIENCE AND INCAPABLE OF MOVING TOWARD THE TRUTH
AND THEREFORE IT SEEMS NATURAL TO US
EVERY ART FROM ARCHITECTURE TO POETRY IS BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION TO WORK ITS EFFECT ON MEN'S SOULS AND TO REDUCE THEM TO A STATE OF STUPEFACTION AND THIS EFFECT IS CONSTANTLY PRODUCED
FROM THIS FOLLOW ALL THE MISTAKES MADE BY SCIENTIFIC MEN ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND ESPECIALLY TWO STRANGE MISCONCEPTIONS WHICH MORE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE HINDER THEM FROM A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF IT
BUT PRECISELY HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST THERE BE TO MAKE IT SO?--THAT IS THE QUESTION
WITHOUT THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF SELF AND THE ABASEMENT OF OTHERS WITHOUT HYPOCRISIES AND DECEPTIONS WITHOUT PRISONS FORTRESSES EXECUTIONS AND MURDERS NO POWER CAN COME INTO EXISTENCE OR BE MAINTAINED
GOD COULD NOT LEAVE MEN TO INTERPRET HIS TEACHING AT RANDOM--THEREFORE HE FOUNDED THE CHURCH
MEN WHO STRICTLY KEEP THE EXTERNAL FORMS OF RELIGION ARE REWARDED AND GIVEN PRIVILEGES
THIS WAS A FRESH AND TERRIBLE CRIME
MOREOVER THIS DREAD OF THE SUPPRESSION OF THE VISIBLE PROTECTION OF THE POLICEMAN IS ESSENTIALLY A SENTIMENT OF TOWNSPEOPLE THAT IS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN ABNORMAL AND ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS
CONFLICT WITH ERROR HAS NO WEAPONS OTHER THAN THOUGHT AND FEELING
EVEN IF A MAN NOWADAYS DID CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES AND DID NOT READ THE GOSPEL MERE ASSOCIATION WITH PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF RELIGION AND FAITH WHICH HAPPENS SO EASILY IN THESE DAYS COMPELS HIM TO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH OF HIS OWN FAITH
EVERY SAVAGE HAS SOMETHING HE HOLDS SACRED SOMETHING FOR WHICH HE IS READY TO SUFFER SOMETHING HE WILL NOT CONSENT TO DO
THE GREATEST SAGES OF THE WORLD THE TEACHERS OF HUMANITY PLATO AND ARISTOTLE JUSTIFIED THE EXISTENCE OF SLAVES AND DEMONSTRATED THE LAWFULNESS OF SLAVERY
PUBLIC OPINION
THEIR CONDUCT ONLY TENDS TO INCREASE THE DESPOTISM OF GOVERNMENT
WHOSOEVER HEARETH THESE SAYINGS OF MINE AND DOETH THEM I WILL LIKEN HIM UNTO A WISE MAN WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON A ROCK
THERE IS ONLY THE IMAGE OF TRUTH TO GUIDE-HIM FOR INWARD PERFECTION IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND FOR OUTWARD PERFECTION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
AND THE NUMBER OF THE DISAFFECTED IN THE ARMY IS ALWAYS INCREASING
AND THE NATIONS ARE NOT DECEIVED BY IT
WE SELL THEM SPIRITS TOBACCO AND OPIUM TO BRUTALIZE THEM
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTH
TWENTY YEARS AGO IN A DRAWING ROOM I DARED IN THE PRESENCE OF FORTY PERSONS TO MOOT THE PROPOSITION THAT WAR WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH CHRISTIANITY
AND THOSE WHO DO SO CERTAINLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT
THE SAME GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AND CANNONS AND FORTRESSES AND REVIEWS AND MANEUVERS BUT NO WAR BREAKS OUT
AND TRULY EVERY CHRISTIAN CREED THAT HAS BEEN DERIVED FROM CHRIST MUST HAVE COME DOWN TO THE PRESENT GENERATION THROUGH A CERTAIN TRANSMISSION
ALL THE GOOD MEN SUCH AS FRANCIS OF ASSISI AND FRANCIS OF SALES OUR TIHON ZADONSKY THOMAS A KEMPIS AND OTHERS WERE GOOD MEN IN SPITE OF THEIR SERVING AN INSTITUTION HOSTILE TO CHRISTIANITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL BETTER IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE ERROR WHICH THEY WERE SERVING
IT IS TIME TO DISMISS ALL THESE FALSE SENTIMENTALITIES
THEY TOLERATE IT BECAUSE FOR THEM THE RISKS OF SUFFERING FROM A FOOLISH OR CRUEL MAN BEING AT THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THE ARMY ARE ALWAYS LESS THAN THE DISADVANTAGES TO WHICH THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF
AS THOUGH A BAND OF BRIGANDS WHO HAVE SOME UNARMED TRAVELERS BOUND AND READY TO BE PLUNDERED SHOULD BE SO TOUCHED BY THEIR COMPLAINTS OF THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE CORDS THEY ARE FASTENED WITH AS TO LET THEM GO AGAIN
THE OTHER MEEKNESS PENITENCE HUMILITY PROGRESS AND LIFE
THEY USUALLY BEGIN BY SENDING THE CULPRIT TO THE PRIESTS AND THE LATTER TO THEIR SHAME BE IT SAID ALWAYS EXHORT HIM TO OBEDIENCE
SO THAT THE ONE CHURCH IS ONLY A FANTASTIC IMAGINATION WHICH HAS NOT THE LEAST TRACE OF REALITY ABOUT IT
WE ARE ENSLAVED BY THE LAWS WE SET UP FOR OUR PROTECTION WHICH HAVE BECOME OUR OPPRESSION
SO IN ATHENS AND IN ROME COMMERCE MANUFACTURES AND LITERATURE NEVER ATTAINED SO HIGH A POINT OF DEVELOPMENT AS WHEN THOSE CITIES WERE MASTERS OF THE WHOLE WORLD BY FORCE OF ARMS
THERE IS A GENERAL DECREE TO THAT EFFECT AND ALL ARE SUMMONED TO THE COUNCIL-HOUSES TO TAKE THE OATH
CAPRIVI INCAUTIOUSLY GAVE UTTERANCE TO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL OR AT LEAST FEELS VAGUELY IF HE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE IT THAT IS THAT THE EXISTING ORDER OF LIFE IS AS IT IS NOT AS WOULD BE NATURAL AND RIGHT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WISH IT TO BE SO BUT BECAUSE IT IS SO MAINTAINED BY STATE VIOLENCE BY THE ARMY WITH ITS BOUGHT UNDER-OFFICERS AND GENERALS
THEY PLEAD THE DANGER OF VIOLENCE--MOST OFTEN IMAGINED IN THE FUTURE--BUT THEY ARE ALL THE WHILE CONTINUING TO PRACTICE ACTUAL VIOLENCE THEMSELVES
AND YET ALL THE ERRONEOUSNESS OF THE ARGUMENT OF THOSE WHO CONSIDER THAT GOVERNMENTS CANNOT GIVE UP THE USE OF FORCE TILL ALL PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THE SAME COULD NOT BE MORE CLEARLY EXPRESSED THAN IT IS IN THAT EPIGRAM
WE SHALL SUBMIT TO EVERY ORDINANCE AND EVERY REQUIREMENT OF GOVERNMENT EXCEPT SUCH AS ARE CONTRARY TO THE COMMANDS OF THE GOSPEL AND IN NO CASE RESIST THE OPERATION OF LAW EXCEPT BY MEEKLY SUBMITTING TO THE PENALTY OF DISOBEDIENCE
SO THAT NOTHING IS GAINED BY IT BUT GENERAL RUIN
THE CONGRESS PROTESTS AGAINST THE USE OF MILITARY DRILL IN SCHOOLS BY WAY OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND SUGGESTS THE FORMATION OF BRIGADES FOR SAVING LIFE RATHER THAN OF A QUASI-MILITARY CHARACTER
THE SAME RICH MEN BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE OF USE BY CEASING TO ADMINISTER THEIR PROPERTY IN PERSON AND GIVING UP TO SOCIETY THE WHOLE OR AT LEAST A PART OF THEIR WEALTH
IS GREECE GREAT FROM HER CONQUESTS OR HER CREATIONS
OUR PLEASURES ARE THOSE OF THE CONDEMNED VICTIM WHO IS OFFERED HIS CHOICE OF DAINTIES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HIS EXECUTION
UN TYPE DOCTRINAL UNIFORME N'A PAS ENCORE ETE ELABORE
WE MUST ADD
ALL THE METHODS OF APPOINTING AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED DIVINE RIGHT AND ELECTION AND HEREDITY AND BALLOTING AND ASSEMBLIES AND PARLIAMENTS AND SENATE--HAVE ALL PROVED INEFFECTUAL
LET US DISHONOR WAR VAIN WRATH CONTINUES MAUPASSANT A POET'S INDIGNATION
12
BUT IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMANDMENT OF NON-RESISTANCE THEY OPENLY TEACH THAT WE MUST NOT UNDERSTAND IT TOO LITERALLY BUT THAT THERE ARE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE MUST DO THE DIRECT OPPOSITE THAT IS GO TO LAW FIGHT PUNISH
BESIDES THESE OBSERVANCES IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIM THAT AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR HE MUST CONFESS
WHO IS TO FORCE THEM AND HOW
ONE OF THESE MISCONCEPTIONS IS THAT THE CHRISTIAN MORAL TEACHING CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT AND THAT THEREFORE IT HAS EITHER NO FORCE AT ALL--THAT IS IT SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS THE RULE OF CONDUCT--OR IT MUST BE TRANSFORMED ADAPTED TO THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH ITS FULFILLMENT IS POSSIBLE IN OUR SOCIETY
BUT IF ONE LOOKS AT IT WITHIN IN ITS INNER CONSCIOUSNESS THE SPECTACLE IT PRESENTS IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT
WE EXPECT TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE FOOLISHNESS OF PREACHING
THEY WERE GOING TO ASSIST AT THE MURDER OF THEIR FATHERS OR GRANDFATHERS JUST AS IF THEY WERE GOING ON A PARTY OF PLEASURE OR AT ANY RATE ON SOME QUITE ORDINARY BUSINESS
CAN HE FIGHT IN CONFLICT WITH FOREIGN ENEMIES OR DISTURBERS OF THE PEACE
OF COURSE GOVERNMENTS WILL PLEAD IN JUSTIFICATION OF THESE MEASURES THAT ALL THEIR EXPENDITURE AND ARMAMENT ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PURPOSES OF DEFENSE
THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING
IF THERE WERE NO BALLAST THE SHIP WOULD NOT BE LOW ENOUGH IN THE WATER AND WOULD SHIFT ITS POSITION AT THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN ITS CONDITIONS
FOR THE AUTHORITY OF ONE SET OF MEN OVER ANOTHER TO ATTAIN ITS OBJECT OF RESTRAINING THOSE WHO OVERRIDE PUBLIC INTERESTS FOR THEIR PERSONAL ENDS POWER OUGHT ONLY TO BE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE IMPECCABLE AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AMONG THE CHINESE AND AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND IS EVEN NOW SUPPOSED TO BE BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE CONSECRATION BY ANOINTING
FOR A CHRISTIAN TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE TO MEN OR THE LAWS OF MEN IS JUST AS THOUGH A WORKMAN BOUND TO ONE EMPLOYER SHOULD ALSO PROMISE TO CARRY OUT EVERY ORDER THAT MIGHT BE GIVEN HIM BY OUTSIDERS
IF A CAPITALIST OR MANUFACTURER YOUR MONEY TO YOUR WORKPEOPLE
THE QUESTION AMOUNTS TO THIS
THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN A GOD IN A CHRIST COMING AGAIN IN GLORY TO JUDGE AND TO PUNISH THE QUICK AND THE DEAD CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE CHRIST WHO BADE US TURN THE LEFT CHEEK JUDGE NOT FORGIVE THESE THAT WRONG US AND LOVE OUR ENEMIES
MORE THAN THAT IF A FEW MEN EVEN OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT TAKING PART IN THE AFFAIR BUT ARE ONLY PRESENT AT THE PREPARATIONS FOR IT OR HAVE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS BEING DONE IN THE PAST DO NOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT BUT BOLDLY AND PLAINLY EXPRESS THEIR DETESTATION OF SUCH CRIMES TO THOSE WHO HAVE TO EXECUTE THEM AND POINT OUT TO THEM ALL THE SENSELESSNESS CRUELTY AND WICKEDNESS OF SUCH ACTS THAT ALONE WILL BE PRODUCTIVE OF GOOD
A MAN NEED ONLY MAKE THIS THEORY OF LIFE HIS OWN FOR THE FETTERS WHICH SEEMED SO INDISSOLUBLY FORGED UPON HIM TO DROP OFF OF THEMSELVES AND FOR HIM TO FEEL HIMSELF ABSOLUTELY FREE JUST AS A BIRD WOULD FEEL ITSELF FREE IN A FENCED-IN PLACE DIRECTLY IT TOOLS TO ITS WINGS
WHAT WAY THEN CAN THE ANNIHILATION OF THE LIFE OF SOME MEN AMELIORATE MEN'S LIFE
IT WOULD EVEN BE INJURING SOCIETY FOR HIM TO DO SO
NOW THE OUTWARD CONDITION OF CRUELTY AND OF SLAVERY IS COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY TO THE CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUSNESS OF MEN AND EVERY STEP IN ADVANCE ONLY INTENSIFIES THIS CONTRADICTION
IT SHALL BE MORE TOLERABLE FOR THE LAND OF SODOM THAN FOR THIS CITY ETC ETC
THEY CAN DO NOTHING BUT GIVE ORDERS AND THEY GIVE ORDERS AND SEND THEIR MESSENGERS AS THE OFFICER SENT THE POLICEMAN TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE
AND THE MORE IT WAS STRAINED FROM ITS MEANING AND THE MORE OBSCURE IT BECAME THE MORE STRONGLY ITS INFALLIBILITY HAD TO BE ASSERTED AND THE LESS COMPREHENSIBLE THE DOCTRINE BECAME
BUT IT REMAINS A MYSTERY TO EVERY DISINTERESTED MAN WHENCE THEY CAN EXPECT ATTACKS IF ALL THE GREAT POWERS ARE SINGLE-HEARTED IN THEIR POLICY IN PURSUING NOTHING BUT SELF DEFENSE
HE TEACHES THAT CHRISTIANITY EXPECTING FROM ITS ADHERENTS GENTLENESS MEEKNESS PEACEABLENESS FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK WHEN ONE IS STRUCK AND LOVE FOR ENEMIES IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF FORCE WHICH IS AN INDISPENSABLE CONDITION OF AUTHORITY
HAVING COME TO THIS CONCLUSION GARRISON THEREUPON COMPOSED AND LAID BEFORE THE SOCIETY A DECLARATION WHICH WAS SIGNED AT THE TIME--IN 1838--BY MANY MEMBERS
WE REGARD AS UNJUST AND PERNICIOUS THE DISTRIBUTION OF LANDED PROPERTY BUT WE ARE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO IT
ALL DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF RE-ESTABLISHING PEACE INSTEAD OF EVERLASTING WAR--IS THE PERNICIOUS SENTIMENTALITY OF PHRASEMONGERS
OR IN PUTTING INTO PRISON SOME MAN WE HAVE OURSELVES CORRUPTED AND THROWING HIS FAMILY ON THE STREETS
THE YOUNG RECRUITS MOVING ABOUT IN LINES YONDER ARE DESTINED TO DEATH LIKE THE FLOCKS OF SHEEP DRIVEN BY THE BUTCHER ALONG THE ROAD
JUST AS HERE IN THE TOULA PROVINCE A LANDLORD WANTED TO APPROPRIATE THE PROPERTY OF THE PEASANTS AND JUST IN THE SAME WAY THE PEASANTS OPPOSED IT
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE BEFORE US MEN ARE GOING TO MURDER AND TORTURE THE FAMISHING AND THEY ADMIT THAT IN THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PEASANTS AND THE LANDOWNER THE PEASANTS ARE RIGHT ALL THOSE IN COMMAND SAID AS MUCH TO ME THEY KNOW THAT THE PEASANTS ARE WRETCHED POOR AND HUNGRY AND THE LANDOWNER IS RICH AND INSPIRES NO SYMPATHY
AND THEREFORE IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT THE BETTER BUT THE WORSE HAVE ALWAYS RULED AND ARE RULING NOW
CAN HE PAY TAXES TO SUCH A GOVERNMENT
THE CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THAT A GENERAL DISARMAMENT WOULD BE THE BEST GUARANTEE OF PEACE AND WOULD LEAD TO THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTIONS WHICH NOW MOST DIVIDE STATES EXPRESSES THE WISH THAT A CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE STATES OF EUROPE MAY BE ASSEMBLED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE MEANS OF EFFECTING A GRADUAL GENERAL DISARMAMENT
FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF THE SOCIETY AND THE JOURNAL I GAINED FROM THE EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHY OF W
FOR THE MOST PART THEY DO NOT EVEN SEE HOW ALL THE ATROCIOUS DEEDS THEY HAVE SUGGESTED AND AUTHORIZED ARE CARRIED OUT
AND IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS OF THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT THESE REASONS HAVE THE SAME FORCE FOR ALL OTHER MEN AND THAT THEY ALL OUGHT TO HAVE DONE THE SAME LONG AGO
AND THEREFORE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE EFFORTS OF ALL MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY WHO PROFESS TO WISH TO WORK FOR THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO STRENGTHENING THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF CHRISTIAN TRUTH IN THEMSELVES AND OTHERS
I KNOW CASES WHEN SOLDIERS COMMANDED TO FIRE HAVE REFUSED TO OBEY AND I KNOW MANY CASES OF OFFICERS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO COMMAND EXPEDITIONS FOR TORTURE AND MURDER
XXVI
SUCH MEDIATION IS NOT WANTED AND WAS DIRECTLY FORBIDDEN BY CHRIST WHO HAS REVEALED HIS TEACHING DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY TO EACH MAN
AT THE SAME TIME THEY CONTINUE TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS THAT THEY ARE ALL MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THESE WORKING CLASSES WHOM THEY HAVE ALWAYS TRAMPLED UNDER THEIR FEET AND ON SUNDAYS RICHLY DRESSED THEY DRIVE IN SUMPTUOUS CARRIAGES TO THE HOUSES OF GOD BUILT IN VERY MOCKERY OF CHRISTIANITY AND THERE LISTEN TO MEN TRAINED TO THIS WORK OF DECEPTION WHO IN WHITE NECKTIES OR IN BROCADED VESTMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR DENOMINATION PREACH THE LOVE FOR THEIR NEIGHBOR WHICH THEY ALL GAINSAY IN THEIR LIVES
THE LEAST WORD THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION WOULD BE ENOUGH TO STOP THEM
EVEN IF ALL THESE PHRASES OUGHT TO BE INTERPRETED IN A FIGURATIVE SENSE AND ARE ALLEGORIES WE KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE ALL CHURCHMEN ARE NOT AGREED ABOUT IT BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE MAJORITY STICK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HOLY SCRIPTURE IN ITS LITERAL SENSE
EVERY GOVERNMENT IS THUS INVOLUNTARILY REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF EMULATING ONE ANOTHER IN THE INCREASE OF THEIR ARMIES
AND CHURCHMEN HAVE CHOSEN THE LATTER
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS PRESENTED TO THE MEN OF OUR WORLD TO-DAY AS A DOCTRINE WHICH EVERYONE HAS KNOWN SO LONG AND ACCEPTED SO UNHESITATINGLY IN ALL ITS MINUTEST DETAILS THAT IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN IT IS UNDERSTOOD NOW
WHAT DECEPTIONS AND WHAT STRENUOUS EFFORTS THE CHURCHES MUST EMPLOY TO CONTINUE IN SPITE OF ALL THESE TENDENCIES SUBVERSIVE OF THE FAITH TO BUILD CHURCHES TO PERFORM MASSES TO PREACH TO TEACH TO CONVERT AND MOST OF ALL TO RECEIVE FOR IT ALL IMMENSE EMOLUMENTS AS DO ALL THESE PRIESTS PASTORS INCUMBENTS SUPERINTENDENTS ABBOTS ARCHDEACONS BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS
IF THE MAJORITY ACTED THUS THEY WOULD ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LOVE AND GOOD WILL EVEN OVER EVIL DOERS NEVER OPPOSING EVIL WITH EVIL AND NEVER RESORTING TO FORCE
WE OUGHT TO ANALYZE HIS WORDS WITH RESPECT FOR THEM BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF CRITICISM ACCEPTING WHAT IS TRUE ETC
THIS METHOD OF REPLY IS EMPLOYED BY ALL THE MORE OR LESS CULTIVATED RELIGIOUS WRITERS THAT IS TO SAY THOSE WHO FEEL THE LAWS OF CHRIST BINDING FOR THEMSELVES
NOTHING IS HEARD BUT THE WAILING OF THE WIVES AND MOTHERS
WHEN SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY TORTURED THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WOULD BE SECURED FOREVER AMONG THEM
THE PROCESS IS KEPT UP DURING LATER YEARS BY THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF RELIGIOUS AND PATRIOTIC SUPERSTITIONS
THE SUBORDINATE OUGHT NEVER TO REFUSE TO CARRY OUT THE ORDERS OF A SUPERIOR OFFICER EXCEPT WHEN HE SEES CLEARLY THAT IN CARRYING OUT HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER'S COMMAND HE BREAKS THE LAW OF GOD ONE INVOLUNTARILY EXPECTS
THAT IS FALSE
THE MOTIVE POWER OF HIS LIFE IS GLORY
THE AIM OF THE PROPOSED INSTITUTION THE INSTITUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF ARBITRATION IS THAT THE NATIONS OF EUROPE MAY CEASE TO BE NATIONS OF ROBBERS AND THEIR ARMIES BANDS OF BRIGANDS
THE EXTERNAL LIFE OF CHRISTIAN PEOPLES REMAINS PAGAN THOUGH THEY ARE PENETRATED BY CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUSNESS--THE WAY OUT OF THIS CONTRADICTION IS BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE--ONLY THROUGH CHRISTIANITY IS EVERY MAN FREE AND EMANCIPATED OF ALL HUMAN AUTHORITY--THIS EMANCIPATION CAN BE EFFECTED BY NO CHANGE IN EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE BUT ONLY BY A CHANGE IN THE CONCEPTION OF LIFE--THE CHRISTIAN IDEAL OF LIFE REQUIRES RENUNCIATION OF ALL VIOLENCE AND IN EMANCIPATING THE MAN WHO ACCEPTS IT EMANCIPATES THE WHOLE WORLD FROM ALL EXTERNAL AUTHORITIES--THE WAY OUT OF THE PRESENT APPARENTLY HOPELESS POSITION IS FOR EVERY MAN WHO IS CAPABLE OF ASSIMILATING THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO ACCEPT IT AND LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT--BUT MEN CONSIDER THIS WAY TOO SLOW AND LOOK FOR DELIVERANCE THROUGH CHANGES IN MATERIAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AIDED BY GOVERNMENT--THAT WILL LEAD TO NO IMPROVEMENT AS IT IS SIMPLY INCREASING THE EVIL UNDER WHICH MEN ARE SUFFERING--A
THEY ARE AWARE THAT THE WORKING CLASSES KNOW THAT THEY ARE DECEIVED AND EXPLOITED AND THAT THEY ARE BEGINNING TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES TO SHAKE OFF OPPRESSION AND REVENGE THEMSELVES ON THEIR OPPRESSORS
HE COULD NOT RECOVER FROM HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE COMPLETE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE REALITY AND WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND AMONG CHRISTIAN NATIONS
ALL THE REVOLUTIONS IN HISTORY ARE ONLY EXAMPLES OF THE MORE WICKED SEIZING POWER AND OPPRESSING THE GOOD
THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND ALL THEIR ENJOYMENTS ARE EMBITTERED EITHER BY THE STINGS OF CONSCIENCE OR BY TERROR
DOES NOT ALL HISTORY SHOW THAT THE GREATEST MAKERS OF HERETICS AND MASTERS OF THAT CRAFT WERE JUST THESE WISE MEN FROM WHOM THE FATHER HID HIS SECRETS THAT IS THE HYPOCRITES THE PHARISEES AND LAWYERS MEN UTTERLY GODLESS AND PERVERTED QUESTION 20-21
E ROB THEM
THAT IF ROBBERY IS DISGRACEFUL INVASION CANNOT BE GLORIOUS
FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE THESE MEN HAVE PROBABLY NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT STATE ORGANIZATION AND THE NECESSITY OF IT
THE DOOR IS OPENED AND THE GUARD CALLS PIOTR SIDOROV
KNOWING THAT THE CONTRADICTION EXISTING BETWEEN THE TEACHING OF CHRIST WHICH WE PROFESS WITH OUR LIPS AND THE WHOLE ORDER OF OUR LIVES CANNOT BE REMOVED BY WORDS AND THAT TOUCHING UPON IT CAN ONLY MAKE IT MORE OBVIOUS THEY WITH MORE OR LESS INGENUITY EVADE IT PRETENDING THAT THE QUESTION OF RECONCILING CHRISTIANITY WITH THE USE OF FORCE HAS BEEN DECIDED ALREADY OR DOES NOT EXIST AT ALL
AND THE OATH OF OBEDIENCE TO THIS QUESTION THE AUTHOR GIVES NO REPLY
OR TO FORCE HIM TO EXHAUSTING LABOR BEYOND HIS STRENGTH TO AUGMENT ONE'S WEALTH AS DO FACTORY OWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS
BUT THE SOPHISTRY OF HYPOCRISY REASONS THAT THE MERCHANT CAN PASS FOR A VIRTUOUS MAN WITHOUT GIVING UP HIS PERNICIOUS COURSE OF ACTION
AND SO TOO AMONG THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MORE AND MORE FREQUENT EXAMPLES HAVE OF LATE APPEARED OF CONSCIOUS CHRISTIAN FREEDOM FROM SUBJECTION TO THE STATE
AND THEREFORE THE CHIEF EFFORTS OF THE MAN WHO WISHES TO SERVE SOCIETY AND IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF HUMANITY OUGHT ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE TO BE DIRECTED NOT TO THE ELUCIDATION AND PROPAGATION OF TRUTH BUT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE EXTERNAL POLITICAL SOCIAL AND ABOVE ALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
BUT THE HORSE IS FREE TO DRAG THE CART HIMSELF OR TO BE DRAGGED WITH IT
SO THAT AT TIMES UNDER EXTERNAL CONDITIONS APPARENTLY VERY FAVORABLE FOR THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH ONE MAN WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT AND ANOTHER ON THE CONTRARY UNDER THE MOST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS WILL WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE RECOGNIZE IT
WELL THAT HAS BEEN TRIED AND IS BEING TRIED EVEN NOW
MAY HE GO WITH A COMPLAINT TO THE JUDGE THAT HE WHO HAS WRONGED HIM MAY BE PUNISHED
WE WHO THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO PASSED THROUGH THE TRANSITION FROM THE PERSONAL ANIMAL VIEW OF LIFE TO THE SOCIALIZED VIEW IMAGINE THAT THAT TRANSITION WAS AN INEVITABLE AND NATURAL ONE
AND THEREFORE THE SHARE OF THE TEMPORAL POWER IN THE CORRUPTION OF THE PEOPLE IS GREATEST IN RUSSIA
BUT BETWEEN THE CONDITION OF MEN IN ANCIENT TIMES AND THEIR CONDITION IN OUR DAYS THERE IS JUST THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD OF VEGETATION BETWEEN THE LAST DAYS OF AUTUMN AND THE FIRST DAYS OF SPRING
OR WHAT IS STILL MORE AMAZING
AND IN THIS THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL
THAT MEANS IS THE PROPAGATION AMONG THESE NATIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN IDEAL OF SOCIETY WHICH CAN ONLY BE REALIZED BY A CHRISTIAN LIFE CHRISTIAN ACTIONS AND CHRISTIAN EXAMPLES
EVEN AT THAT TIME THIS WAS FELT AND UNDERSTOOD BY MANY
IT IS A SUICIDAL ACT
CHRISTIANITY HAS PENETRATED INTO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY NOT ONLY NEGATIVELY BY THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING IN THE PAGAN LIFE BUT ALSO THROUGH ITS SIMPLIFICATION ITS INCREASED CLEARNESS AND FREEDOM FROM THE SUPERSTITIONS INTERMINGLED WITH IT AND ITS DIFFUSION THROUGH ALL CLASSES OF THE POPULATION
MEANWHILE THE READER WHO FEELS TROUBLED LEST IT SHOULD BE HIS DUTY ALSO TO FORSAKE ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS LIFE AND TO TAKE UP THE POSITION AND WORK OF A COMMON LABORER MAY REST FOR THE PRESENT ON THE PRINCIPLE SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS TERRARUM
THEY STUDIOUSLY DECEIVE THE CHILD ON THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT IN LIFE AND WHEN THE DECEPTION HAS SO GROWN INTO HIS LIFE THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO UPROOT IT THEN THEY REVEAL TO HIM THE WHOLE WORLD OF SCIENCE AND REALITY WHICH CANNOT BY ANY MEANS BE RECONCILED WITH THE BELIEFS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTILLED INTO HIM LEAVING IT TO HIM TO FIND HIS WAY AS BEST HE CAN OUT OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS
AND SECONDLY THAT THESE ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE VERY VARIED AND ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE
ALL WE HAVE BEGUN THE PLANS WE ARE DEVELOPING OUR SCHEMES OF WORK THE LITTLE GOOD WE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WILL IT NOT ALL BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE TEMPEST THAT IS IN PREPARATION
MUSSER'S BOOK IS CALLED NON-RESISTANCE ASSERTED OR KINGDOM OF CHRIST AND KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD SEPARATED THIS BOOK IS DEVOTED TO THE SAME QUESTION AND WAS WRITTEN WHEN THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS EXACTING MILITARY SERVICE FROM ITS CITIZENS AT THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR

23--THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT OR THE CREED--THE ORTHODOX CHURCH CONCEALS FROM THE PEOPLE THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY--THE SAME THING IS DONE BY THE OTHER CHURCHES--ALL THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE ARE SUCH AS TO DESTROY THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH AND THEREFORE THE CHURCHES USE EVERY EFFORT TO SUPPORT THEIR DOCTRINES
METHODS OF SUPPORTING EDUCATION WHICH NOT ONLY FAIL TO PREVENT IGNORANCE BUT EVEN INCREASE IT
ACCORDING TO THE EXISTING THEORY SO ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT HYPOCRISY MAN IS NOT FREE AND CANNOT CHANGE HIS LIFE
WHEN WHOLE NATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBJUGATED BY A NEW RELIGION AND HAVE BECOME CHRISTIAN OR MOHAMMEDAN SUCH A CONVERSION HAS NEVER BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES MADE IT OBLIGATORY ON THE CONTRARY VIOLENCE HAS MUCH OFTENER ACTED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT BECAUSE PUBLIC OPINION MADE SUCH A CHANGE INEVITABLE
AND THERE WOULD BE NONE EXCEPT THAT A MAN AND THEREBY ALL MEN IS GIFTED WITH THE POWER OF FORMING A DIFFERENT HIGHER THEORY OF LIFE WHICH AT ONCE FREES HIM FROM ALL THE BONDS BY WHICH HE SEEMS INDISSOLUBLY FETTERED
CHRIST IN FACT PREACHED COMPLETE COMMUNISM AND ANARCHY
HE KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE WIVES AND MOTHERS AND CHILDREN DISGRACED AND MADE MISERABLE BY SEPARATION FROM THEM VAINLY BEGGING FOR PARDON FOR THEM OR SOME ALLEVIATION OF THEIR SENTENCE AND THIS JUDGE OR THIS PROSECUTOR IS SO HARDENED IN HIS HYPOCRISY THAT HE AND HIS FELLOWS AND HIS WIFE AND HIS HOUSEHOLD ARE ALL FULLY CONVINCED THAT HE MAY BE A MOST EXEMPLARY MAN
THAT'S WHAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE FOR
OR IN PLUNDERING AND BUTCHERING IN WAR
AND IN THE NAME OF FRATERNITY READY TO MURDER THEIR BROTHERS SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
IN THESE DAYS OF SOCIALISTIC SEDITION IT MAY COME TO PASS THAT I COMMAND YOU TO FIRE ON YOUR OWN KINDRED YOUR BROTHERS EVEN YOUR OWN FATHERS AND MOTHERS--WHICH GOD FORBID!--EVEN THEN YOU ARE BOUND TO OBEY MY ORDERS WITHOUT HESITATION THIS MAN EXPRESSES WHAT ALL SENSIBLE RULERS THINK BUT STUDIOUSLY CONCEAL
P
IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ASSERTION THAT CHRISTIANITY IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE USE OF FORCE THESE MEN USUALLY WITH THE GREATEST AUDACITY BRING TOGETHER ALL THE MOST OBSCURE PASSAGES FROM THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS INTERPRETING THEM IN THE MOST UNCHRISTIAN WAY--THE PUNISHMENT OF ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA OF SIMON THE SORCERER ETC
THEY DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY IN CHRISTIANITY'S HAVING A FIRM AND CLEAR BASIS IN THE HUMAN SOUL WHILE LOVE FOR HUMANITY IS ONLY A THEORETICAL DEDUCTION FROM ANALOGY
AND SO GOVERNMENTS CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT TO CONSENT TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THESE DRILLED SLAVES WHO CONSTITUTE THEIR WHOLE POWER AND IMPORTANCE
NO READER CAN PUT DOWN THE BOOK WITHOUT FEELING HIMSELF BETTER AND MORE TRUTH-LOVING FOR HAVING READ IT
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROVOKED OR AIDED OR ALLOWED THIS DEED ARE SUCH WORTHLESS CREATURES THAT KNOWING ALL THE INFAMY OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING THEY DO IT AGAINST THEIR PRINCIPLES SOME FOR PAY AND FOR PROFIT OTHERS THROUGH FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
HE KNOWS THAT THE PROSECUTOR WHO OUGHT TO HAVE COME FLATLY REFUSED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE HE REGARDED IT AS DISGRACEFUL
23 3 THIS WAS SPOKEN OF THE PHARISEES WHO FULFILLED ALL THE EXTERNAL OBSERVANCES PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW AND THEREFORE THE WORDS WHATSOEVER THEY BID YOU OBSERVE THAT OBSERVE AND DO REFER TO WORKS OF MERCY AND GOODNESS AND THE WORDS DO NOT YE AFTER THEIR WORKS FOR THEY SAY AND DO NOT REFER TO THEIR OBSERVANCE OF CEREMONIES AND THEIR NEGLECT OF GOOD WORKS AND HAVE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE MEANING TO THAT WHICH THE CHURCHMEN TRY TO GIVE TO THE PASSAGE INTERPRETING IT AS AN INJUNCTION TO OBSERVE CEREMONIES
BUT NOW A TIME HAS COME WHEN MEN MISTAKE THE TRUE FAITH FOR HERESY AND THEREFORE IT IS FOR THE REASON TO POINT OUT WHAT THE TRUE FAITH CONSISTS IN IF ANYONE DOES NOT KNOW THIS
AND LABOR IN THE FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS IS NOT AT ALL THE TERRIBLE THING YOU MAKE IT OUT TO BE
TO INSTILL A FALSE INTERPRETATION OF CHRIST'S TEACHING INTO MEN AND TO PREVENT A TRUE INTERPRETATION OF IT FOR THE MAJORITY OF SO-CALLED BELIEVERS
IT IS NOT THEFT NOR ROBBERY NOR MURDER NOR FORNICATION BUT FALSEHOOD THE SPECIAL FALSEHOOD OF HYPOCRISY WHICH CORRUPTS MEN BRUTALIZES THEM AND MAKES THEM VINDICTIVE DESTROYS ALL DISTINCTION BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG IN THEIR CONSCIENCE DEPRIVES THEM OF WHAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF ALL REAL HUMAN LIFE AND DEBARS THEM FROM ALL PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION
THE MISERABLE GOVERNOR INTOXICATED WITH POWER WAS COUNTING THE STROKES ON HIS FINGERS AND NEVER LEFT OFF SMOKING CIGARETTES WHILE SEVERAL OFFICIOUS PERSONS HASTENED ON EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER HIM A BURNING MATCH TO LIGHT THEM
IT HAS COME TO MEN IN POWER CEASING TO ATTEMPT TO PROVE THAT WHAT THEY REGARD AS EVIL IS EVIL AND SIMPLY DECLARING THAT THEY REGARD AS EVIL WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE WHILE THEIR SUBJECTS NO LONGER OBEY THEM BECAUSE THEY ACCEPT THE DEFINITION OF EVIL LAID DOWN BY THEM BUT SIMPLY OBEY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HELP THEMSELVES
THIS MAN'S RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN THE LAND RESTS ON THE FACT THAT AT EVERY EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT TO MAKE USE OF THE LAND HE CONSIDERS HIS TROOPS ARE CALLED OUT TO SUBJECT THEM TO PUNISHMENT AND MURDER
MOREOVER UNDER EVERY GOVERNMENT WITHOUT EXCEPTION EVERYTHING IS KEPT BACK THAT MIGHT EMANCIPATE AND EVERYTHING ENCOURAGED THAT TENDS TO CORRUPT THE PEOPLE SUCH AS LITERARY WORKS TENDING TO KEEP THEM IN THE BARBARISM OF RELIGIOUS AND PATRIOTIC SUPERSTITION ALL KINDS OF SENSUAL AMUSEMENTS SPECTACLES CIRCUSES THEATERS AND EVEN THE PHYSICAL MEANS OF INDUCING STUPEFACTION AS TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL WHICH FORM THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF REVENUE OF STATES
THE DRIFT OF THE TIMID ANSWERS I RECEIVED TO THIS QUESTION WAS ALWAYS APPROXIMATELY THIS
WAS IT NOT THE EASIEST AND MOST ORDINARY ECCLESIASTICAL PROCEEDING IF THE CLERGY WANTED TO GET RID OF OR TO RUIN ANYONE FOR THEM TO CAST SUSPICION ON THE PERSON'S BELIEF AND TO THROW A CLOAK OF HERESY UPON HIM AND BY THIS MEANS TO PROCURE HIS CONDEMNATION AND REMOVAL
THEY ONLY UTTER A CLUCKING SOUND WITH THEIR TONGUES AND SIGH MOURNFULLY KNOWING THAT THEY WILL SEE NO MORE OF THE STEADY LADS THEY HAVE REARED AND TRAINED TO HELP THEM THAT THEY WILL COME BACK NOT THE SAME QUIET HARD-WORKING LABORERS BUT FOR THE MOST PART CONCEITED AND DEMORALIZED UNFITTED FOR THEIR SIMPLE LIFE
HAD THAT CONSCIOUSNESS BEEN STRONGER STILL IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO GO TO THE SCENE OF ACTION AT ALL
HEAR NOT ONLY THEIR PUBLIC UTTERANCES BUT THE COUNSELS GIVEN BY PARENTS AND GUARDIANS TO THE YOUNG IN THEIR CHARGE
AMONG THE MANY POINTS IN WHICH THIS DOCTRINE FALLS SHORT OF THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST I POINTED OUT AS THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE ABSENCE OF ANY COMMANDMENT OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
AND EVEN THE SERVANTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR POSITION AND SO OFTEN DO NOT PERFORM THEIR DUTIES--THESE FACTS ARE ALL SIGNS OF THE RISE OF A PUBLIC OPINION WHICH CONTINUALLY GROWING WILL LEAD TO NO ONE BEING WILLING TO ENTER GOVERNMENT SERVICE--MOREOVER IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THOSE OFFICES ARE OF NO PRACTICAL USE--MEN ALREADY BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THE FUTILITY OF ALL INSTITUTIONS BASED ON VIOLENCE AND IF A FEW ALREADY UNDERSTAND IT ALL WILL ONE DAY UNDERSTAND IT--THE DAY OF DELIVERANCE IS UNKNOWN BUT IT DEPENDS ON MEN THEMSELVES ON HOW FAR EACH MAN LIVES ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT THAT IS IN HIM
THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT OR THE CREED
AND THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY CONCEAL IT FROM OURSELVES WE CANNOT HELP SEEING THAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR LIFE CANNOT LIE IN OUR PERSONAL FLESHLY EXISTENCE THE PREY OF INCURABLE SUFFERING AND INEVITABLE DEATH NOR IN ANY SOCIAL INSTITUTION OR ORGANIZATION
THE ENGLISH DOMINATE THE HINDOOS THE MONGOLIANS DOMINATE THE CHINESE
TROOPS ARE REQUIRED AGAINST INTERNAL FORCES AND ALSO TO KEEP UP A POSITION WITH OTHER STATES
I THINK THAT ARGUMENTS OF THIS KIND ONLY OBSCURE MEN'S CONSCIENCE
AND WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN ACTS V
IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE TRANSITIONS OF MANKIND FROM ONE CONCEPTION--AND SO FROM ONE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE--TO ANOTHER
DON'T TALK NONSENSE
HUMANITY IS PASSING THROUGH SEEMINGLY UNNECESSARY FRUITLESS AGONIES
BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH MEN WHO PROFESS NO REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS NOR ANY PECULIAR RELIGIOUS DOGMAS BUT MERELY BECAUSE THEY ARE UNWILLING TO DO EVIL TO ANY MAN REFUSE TO TAKE THE OATH TO PAY TAXES TO TAKE PART IN LAW PROCEEDINGS TO SERVE IN THE ARMY TO FULFILL IN FACT ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS UPON WHICH THE WHOLE FABRIC OF A STATE RESTS
EVEN IF THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO WHEN MEN PRIDED THEMSELVES ON THEIR WARLIKE PROWESS WHEN KILLING MEN WAS CONSIDERED AN HEROIC ACHIEVEMENT THERE WERE SUCH PERSONS
AND IS NOT THE SAME THING DONE IN ANGLICANISM LUTHERANISM AND EVERY DENOMINATION OF PROTESTANTISM WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED INTO A CHURCH
SO LONG AS AMONG PEOPLE NOMINALLY CHRISTIANS THERE ARE UNCHRISTIAN WICKED MEN WHO FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF THEIR OWN LUSTS ARE READY TO DO HARM TO OTHERS THE SUPPRESSION OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY FAR FROM BEING A BLESSING TO OTHERS WOULD ONLY INCREASE THEIR MISERIES
BUT INSTINCT REPLACING REASON IN THIS INSTANCE GUIDES THEM UNERRINGLY
AS A SOLDIER OF GIVING UP MURDER
ONE WOULD IMAGINE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY WHAT IS SO OBVIOUS
ALL WE CAN KNOW IS WHAT WE WHO MAKE UP MANKIND OUGHT TO DO AND NOT TO DO TO BRING ABOUT THE COMING OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
AND ONE SET OF MINISTERS REPLACING ANOTHER IN THE SAME WAY AND THE SAME SPEECHES AND THE SAME INCIDENTS
M
PUBLIC OPINION ARISES SPONTANEOUSLY AND SPREADS FOR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS BUT IT HAS THE POWER OF WORKING ON MEN BY INFECTION AND WITH GREAT RAPIDITY GAINS A HOLD ON GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN
THE ONLY DISTINCTION IS THAT THE HIGHER AND THE MORE EXCEPTIONAL THEIR POSITION THE MORE NECESSARY IT IS FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE ORDER OF THINGS
WE CANNOT PRETEND THAT WE DO NOT SEE THE ARMED POLICEMAN WHO MARCHES UP AND DOWN BENEATH OUR WINDOWS TO GUARANTEE OUR SECURITY WHILE WE EAT OUR LUXURIOUS DINNER OR LOOK AT THE NEW PIECE AT THE THEATER OR THAT WE ARE UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOLDIERS WHO WILL MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE WITH GUNS AND CARTRIDGES DIRECTLY OUR PROPERTY IS ATTACKED
AND THEREFORE YOU CANNOT BUT REFLECT ON YOUR POSITION AS LANDOWNER MANUFACTURER JUDGE EMPEROR PRESIDENT MINISTER PRIEST AND SOLDIER WHICH IS BOUND UP WITH VIOLENCE DECEPTION AND MURDER AND RECOGNIZE ITS UNLAWFULNESS
THE RESULT OF THIS IS THAT ALL THESE SCIENTIFIC MEN FROM KANT STRAUSS SPENCER AND RENAN DOWN DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF CHRIST'S SAYINGS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE THE OBJECT OR THE REASON OF THEIR UTTERANCE DO NOT UNDERSTAND EVEN THE QUESTION TO WHICH THEY FORM THE ANSWER
AND I DO NOT NEED THIS AND I CANNOT DO IT NOT BECAUSE SUCH IS MY OWN MY PERSONAL WILL BUT BECAUSE SUCH IS THE WILL OF HIM WHO SENT ME INTO LIFE AND GAVE ME AN INDUBITABLE LAW FOR MY CONDUCT THROUGH LIFE WHATEVER ARGUMENTS MAY BE ADVANCED IN SUPPORT OF THE CONTENTION THAT THE SUPPRESSION OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY WOULD BE INJURIOUS AND WOULD LEAD TO GREAT CALAMITIES MEN WHO HAVE ONCE OUTGROWN THE GOVERNMENTAL FORM OF SOCIETY CANNOT GO BACK TO IT AGAIN
THE GOVERNING CLASSES OR AT LEAST THE GOOD HONEST AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE OF THEM CANNOT BUT SUFFER FROM THESE FUNDAMENTAL INCONSISTENCIES AND SEE THE DANGERS WITH WHICH THEY ARE THREATENED
AND EVERYONE PAYS TAXES TILL SUDDENLY ONE MAN IN KHARKOV ANOTHER IN TVER AND A THIRD IN SAMARA REFUSE TO PAY TAXES--ALL AS THOUGH IN COLLUSION SAYING THE SAME THING
IF THE OPPRESSED ARE MORE WICKED THAN THEIR OPPRESSORS THEY ATTACK THEM AND TRY TO OVERTHROW THEM
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER--FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS--TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
THE RICH ARE MOSTLY COARSE MONEY GRUBBERS ABSORBED ONLY IN INCREASING THEIR HOARD GENERALLY BY DISHONEST MEANS OR ELSE THE DEGENERATE HEIRS OF SUCH MONEY GRUBBERS WHO FAR FROM PLAYING ANY PROMINENT PART IN SOCIETY ARE MOSTLY TREATED WITH GENERAL CONTEMPT
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE BUT QUITE THE CONTRARY THAT IT IS NOT THE BETTER OPPRESS THE WORSE BUT THE WORSE OPPRESS THE BETTER AND SINCE VIOLENCE WILL NEVER PUT AN END TO EVIL AND THERE IS MOREOVER ANOTHER MEANS OF PUTTING AN END TO IT THE ASSERTION THAT VIOLENCE WILL NEVER CEASE IS INCORRECT
IF MEN SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY IT IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LIABLE TO THESE PUNISHMENTS IN CASE OF NON-SUBMISSION
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
25-34
THEY KNEW THEY WERE BOUND BY THE LAW OF GOD THOU SHALT NOT KILL AND KNEW TOO THAT THEY WERE BOUND BY THEIR DUTY AS SOLDIERS BUT HAD NEVER REFLECTED ON THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE DUTIES
OTHERS REGARD IT AS UNJUST ON THE GROUND OF THE SOCIALISTIC COMMUNISTIC OR ANARCHISTIC THEORIES WHICH ARE SPRINGING UP IN THE LOWER STRATA OF THE WORKING PEOPLE
REFLECT BETHINK YOURSELF
FOR EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THE USE OF VIOLENCE OF EVERY KIND FROM THE INQUISITION TO THE SCHLUSSELBURG FORTRESS HAS RESTED AND STILL RESTS ON THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE OF THE NECESSITY OF RESISTING EVIL BY FORCE
WHAT DIDN'T YOU TAKE THE OATH NO I DIDN'T TAKE THE OATH AND WHAT HAPPENED--NOTHING NOTHING THE SUBJECTS OF A STATE ARE ALL BOUND TO PAY TAXES
THESE PRINCIPLES ON THE CONTRARY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT MAKE TRUE LIFE POSSIBLE
AND CHRIST LAYS DOWN HIS PRINCIPLE HAVING IN VIEW THE FACT THAT ABSOLUTE PERFECTION CAN NEVER BE ATTAINED BUT THAT STRIVING TOWARD ABSOLUTE INFINITE PERFECTION WILL CONTINUALLY INCREASE THE BLESSEDNESS OF MEN AND THAT THIS BLESSEDNESS MAY BE INCREASED TO INFINITY THEREBY
THE DOCTRINE OF LOVE FOR HUMANITY ALONE IS BASED ON THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE
LET NOT THY LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THEY RIGHT HAND DOETH NO MAN HAVING PUT HIS HAND TO THE PLOW AND LOOKING BACK IS FIT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD REJOICE NOT THAT THE SPIRITS ARE SUBJECT TO YOU BUT SEEK RATHER THAT YOUR NAMES BE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN BE YE PERFECT EVEN AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS PERFECT SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND ITS RIGHTEOUSNESS THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PRECEPT IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN UNINTERRUPTED PROGRESS TOWARD THE ATTAINMENT OF EVER HIGHER TRUTH TOWARD ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE FIRMLY AN EVER GREATER LOVE WITHIN ONESELF AND ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE WIDELY THE KINGDOM OF GOD OUTSIDE ONESELF
SUCH IS THE ATTITUDE IN REGARD TO THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY NOT ONLY OF THE MEN IN THE TOULA TRAIN BUT OF THE MAJORITY OF MEN OF OUR TIMES ALIKE OF THE HIGHER AND THE LOWER ORDERS
THE PICTURE SEEMS DRAWN FROM THE WORLD OF TO-DAY
THIS FURTHEST LIMIT OF INCONSISTENCY IS UNIVERSAL COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF FORCE WERE NOT USED AGAINST HOSTILE NATIONS AND THE CRIMINAL ELEMENTS OF SOCIETY WE DO NOT KNOW
THE USE OF VIOLENCE GROWS LESS AND LESS AND EVIDENTLY MUST DISAPPEAR
HOW OUGHT A SUBJECT TO BEHAVE WHO BELIEVES THAT WAR IS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS RELIGION WHILE THE GOVERNMENT DEMANDS FROM HIM THAT HE SHOULD ENTER MILITARY SERVICE
FOR A LADY TRAVELING BY THE TRAIN AND A FEW OTHER BYSTANDERS AT THE STATION TO EXPRESS TO THOSE WHO FORMED THE EXPEDITION THEIR DISGUST AT WHAT THEY WERE DOING
THE OTHERS AT LEAST SAY THAT THEY HATE EVIL AND LOVE GOOD BUT THESE OPENLY DECLARE THAT GOOD AND EVIL DO NOT EXIST
ACCORDING TO THIS DEFINITION THE CATHOLICS AND LUTHERANS ARE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AND THERE ARE ONLY ORTHODOX IN THE CHURCH
THEY ARE STRANGE PEOPLE THESE MEN WHO ASSEMBLE IN CONGRESSES AND MAKE SPEECHES TO SHOW US HOW TO CATCH BIRDS BY PUTTING SALT ON THEIR TAILS THOUGH THEY MUST KNOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT
I HAVE LEFT ISSUES OF STANDARD LANGUAGE UNCORRECTED AND HAVE ONLY FIXED TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN WHICH THE WORD WAS NEARLY UNRECOGNIZABLE BUT CLEAR FROM CONTEXT
THOSE WHO HAVE SEIZED POWER AND WHO KEEP IT ANOTHER EXAMPLE
THE PRECEPTS OF THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE ONLY GUIDE MEN BY REQUIRING OF THEM AN EXACT FULFILLMENT OF RULES OR LAWS
SATAN CAN NEVER BE DRIVEN OUT BY SATAN
JOHN IV
2 OF THOSE WHOM THEY MADE HERETICS
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IF MURDER IS A SIN IT IS ALWAYS A SIN WHOEVER ARE THE VICTIMS MURDERED JUST LIKE THE SIN OF ADULTERY THEFT OR ANY OTHER
NO WAR TO BE DECLARED BEFORE IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO A PLEBISCITUM OF THE NATIONS PREPARING TO TAKE PART IN IT
THUS THEY TEACH IT TO THE PEOPLE IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE USING EVERY RESOURCE OF AUTHORITY SOLEMNITY POMP AND VIOLENCE TO IMPRESS THEM
THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS TEACHING CONSISTS ONLY IN WALKING IN THE CHOSEN WAY IN GETTING NEARER TO INWARD PERFECTION IN THE IMITATION OF CHRIST AND OUTWARD PERFECTION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD
IT CARRIES ITS REFUTATION ON THE FACE OF IT
CANNONS AND MUSKETS
THEY SENT ONE MAN IN THIS WAY TO TASHKEND--THAT IS THEY PRETENDED TO TRANSFER TO THE TASHKEND ARMY
IT SEEMED HOWEVER THAT THE BENCH WAS TOO NARROW AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE VICTIM WRITHING IN TORTURE UPON IT
IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE REVOLUTIONISTS HAVE ATTACKED THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS THE GREATEST TERROR AND DANGER FOR EVERY DESPOTISM
THE JUDGES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE GAVE AN UNJUST DECISION I SAY UNJUST ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE LAWYER AND GOVERNOR WHO OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE MATTER AND DECIDED THE CASE IN FAVOR OF THE LANDOWNER
SO THAT NOWADAYS THERE ARE NO SPECIAL MALEFACTORS FROM WHOM THE STATE COULD DEFEND US
HE CANNOT TAKE ANY PART IN GOVERNMENT NOR IN TRADE OR EVEN BE A LANDOWNER
HE HAD BEEN PUT POOR FELLOW IN A POSITION IN WHICH HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE ORDERS
QUOTE SUCH UTTERANCES
AND JUST AS IT WOULD BE SENSELESS TO PULL UP THE TELEGRAPH POSTS FOR FUEL FOR A FAMILY OR SOCIETY AND THUS TO INCREASE ITS WELFARE AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC INTERESTS IN THE SAME WAY IT IS SENSELESS TO DO VIOLENCE TO EXECUTE AND TO MURDER TO INCREASE THE WELFARE OF THE NATION BECAUSE THAT IS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INTERESTS OF HUMANITY
THIS STRANGE AND ABNORMAL CONDITION OF MEN UNDER STATE ORGANIZATION IS USUALLY EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
IF WE ADMIT THE IDEA OF A CHURCH IN THE SENSE HOMYAKOV GIVES TO IT--THAT IS A BODY OF MEN BOUND TOGETHER BY LOVE AND TRUTH--THEN ALL THAT ANY MAN CAN PREDICATE IN REGARD TO THIS BODY IF SUCH AN ONE EXISTS IS ITS LOVE AND TRUTH BUT THERE CAN BE NO OUTER SIGNS BY WHICH ONE COULD RECKON ONESELF OR ANOTHER AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOLY BODY NOR BY WHICH ONE COULD PUT ANYONE OUTSIDE IT
A NEW CONCEPTION OF LIFE CANNOT BE IMPOSED ON MEN
EVEN THE WORD NON-RESISTANCE IS NOT MENTIONED
ALL HISTORY TEACHES US THAT THE ONE IS CREATED FOR THE OTHER THAT BLOOD IS NEEDED TO HASTEN AND CEMENT THE UNION OF THE NATIONS
BUT SO LONG AS ONLY A FEW ACT THUS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM
WHETHER IT BE RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD TO HEARKEN UNTO YOU MORE THAN UNTO GOD JUDGE YE ACTS IV
AND THE MAN IN AUTHORITY ENDURABLE TO-DAY MAY BECOME A BRUTE TO-MORROW OR MAY BE SUCCEEDED BY A MAD OR IMBECILE HEIR LIKE THE KING OF BAVARIA OR OUR PAUL I
TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF DESCRIBING THE SAME THING
HE OPENLY EXPRESSED ALOUD HIS SYMPATHY WITH SUCH PUNISHMENTS
THEN INDEED VIOLENCE COULD NEVER CEASE
WILLIAM IS RULING OVER THE GERMANS STAMBOULOFF OVER THE BULGARIANS THE RUSSIAN OFFICIALS OVER THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE
AND IN THAT WAY IT HAS LASTED FOR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND GOVERNMENTS--THOSE WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN POWER--HAVE TRIED IT AND ARE NOW TRYING MORE ZEALOUSLY THAN EVER TO KEEP THEIR SUBJECTS IN THIS ERROR
E CORRUPT THEM
THIS IS ONE FORM OF DECEPTION THE GENERAL DECEPTION INSTILLED INTO EVERYONE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIAL DECEPTION PRACTICED UPON THE SOLDIERS OR POLICE WHO ARE PICKED OUT BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER TO DO THE TORTURING AND MURDERING NECESSARY TO DEFEND AND MAINTAIN THE EXISTING REGIME
AND LOVE OF POWER IS INCONSISTENT WITH GOODNESS
AS FOR THE ROMAN CHURCH AND OTHER SECTS THE LUTHERANS AND THE REST THEY DO NOT EVEN DIGNIFY BY THE NAME OF CHURCH THEY CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN THE ONE TRUE CHURCH SINCE THEY HAVE THEMSELVES SEPARATED FROM IT
AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO EXIST SO LONG AS THE CONCEPTION OF A CHURCH EXISTS
IF ALL MEN WERE TO LEARN THAT THE CHURCH PROFESSES TO BELIEVE IN A CHRIST OF PUNISHMENT AND WARFARE NOT OF FORGIVENESS NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IN THE CHURCH AND IT COULD NOT PROVE TO ANYONE WHAT IT IS TRYING TO PROVE
THIS CONSISTS IN CHECKING THE MORAL DEVELOPMENT OF MEN AND BY VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS KEEPING THEM BACK IN THE IDEAL OF LIFE OUTGROWN BY MANKIND AT LARGE ON WHICH THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT RESTS
YOU HAVE SWORN FIDELITY TO ME LADS OF MY GUARD
HERE IS THE SUMMARY OF SOME EXTRACTS FROM THEM
THE CONDITION OF MEN IS THE RESULT OF THEIR DISUNION
A FOURTH STILL MORE REFINED REPLY TO THE QUESTION WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE CHRISTIAN'S ATTITUDE TO CHRIST'S COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE
ALREADY AT THE TIME CHRISTIANITY AROSE IT WAS EVIDENT TO A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE WHERE IT AROSE THAT WHAT WAS REGARDED AS EVIL BY NERO AND CALIGULA COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS EVIL BY OTHERS
THE LANDOWNER WISHED TO KEEP THE FOREST ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO FELL THE TREES
BUT IN THE SECOND CASE WHEN THE PEASANTS DO SUBMIT SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL PECULIAR TO RUSSIA TAKES PLACE
WHAT DOES THIS WORD EXPRESS
YOU WHO FILL YOUR POSITION OF LANDOWNER MERCHANT TZAR PRIEST OR SOLDIER KNOW VERY WELL THAT YOU OCCUPY THAT POSITION BY NO MEANS WITH THE UNSELFISH AIM OF MAINTAINING THE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE NECESSARY TO MEN'S HAPPINESS BUT SIMPLY IN YOUR OWN INTERESTS TO SATISFY YOUR OWN COVETOUSNESS OR VANITY OR AMBITION OR INDOLENCE OR COWARDICE
AND THEN AFTER HAVING OURSELVES ASSIDUOUSLY CORRUPTED MEN WE SHUT THEM UP LIKE WILD BEASTS IN PLACES FROM WHICH THEY CANNOT ESCAPE AND WHERE THEY BECOME STILL MORE BRUTALIZED OR ELSE WE KILL THEM
EVEN IF THERE ARE SOME ABUSES IN FACTORIES THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC ARE TAKING STEPS TO OBVIATE THEM AND TO MAKE THE LABOR OF THE FACTORY WORKERS MUCH EASIER AND EVEN AGREEABLE
NATIONS ON THE CONTRARY WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY FORCE TO ACCEPT THE FAITH OF THEIR CONQUERORS HAVE ALWAYS REMAINED ANTAGONISTIC TO IT

IT WOULD SEEM EVIDENT THAT THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN LIFE AND CONSCIENCE HAD REACHED THE LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO AND AFTER REACHING THIS LIMIT SOME SOLUTION OF IT MUST BE FOUND
BUT OUR POSITION IS SO FAR FROM BEING SECURE THAT WE KNOW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT WE ARE STANDING ON THE BRINK OF A PRECIPICE
WE MAY DISPUTE UPON THE QUESTION WHETHER THE NESTLINGS ARE READY TO DO WITHOUT THE MOTHER-HEN AND TO COME OUT OF THE EGGS OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT YET ADVANCED ENOUGH
THE CHRISTIAN PRECEPTS THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE IS NOT A PRECEPT IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD BUT THE EXPRESSION OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE RELIGION ARE THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT--ALL NEGATIVE IN CHARACTER
ONLY WHAT IS FALSE IN THEM WILL BE DESTROYED
THEY ARE BROUGHT BEFORE RURAL POLICE OFFICERS DISTRICT POLICE CAPTAINS PRIESTS AND GOVERNORS
AN EXECUTION SUCH AS WAS PROPOSED BY JOUKOVSKY WHICH WOULD PRODUCE EVEN A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS EMOTION IN THE SPECTATORS WOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST PERVERTING ACTIONS IMAGINABLE
ALL ARE AGREED THAT IF IT WERE TO BREAK OUT IN EUROPE ITS CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE LIKE THOSE OF THE GREAT INROADS OF BARBARIANS
YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE IF THERE WERE ANY DOUBT OF CHRISTIANITY BEING THE TRUTH THE PERFECT LIBERTY THAT NOTHING CAN CURTAIL WHICH A MAN EXPERIENCES DIRECTLY HE MAKES THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE HIS OWN WOULD BE AN UNMISTAKABLE PROOF OF ITS TRUTH
IF IT IS SO LIFE IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THOUGH THERE ARE SUCH SINCERE PEOPLE WHO EVEN THOUGH THEY CANNOT RENOUNCE THEIR FAULT AT LEAST SEE IT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MEN OF THE MODERN WORLD HAVE SO ENTERED INTO THE PARTS THEY PLAY IN THEIR HYPOCRISY THAT THEY BOLDLY DENY WHAT IS STARING EVERYONE IN THE FACE
ALL OF THEM ARE MORE OR LESS CONVINCED THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS IMMUTABLE BECAUSE--THE CHIEF CONSIDERATION--IT IS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
OR IN THE MIDDLE AGES A CHRISTIAN REFUSED TO WORSHIP IMAGES OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE--THESE CASES WERE IN THE FIRST PLACE A MATTER OF CHANCE
WE HAVE ALL BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF COVETOUSNESS TRICKERY AND PARTY STRUGGLES
THINGS WENT ON LIKE THIS FOR EIGHTEEN CENTURIES AND AT LAST REACHED THE PRESENT POSITION IN WHICH IT IS ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS AND CAN BE NO EXTERNAL DEFINITION OF EVIL BINDING UPON ALL
AND THE SAME WITH THE TRANSITIONS OF POWER WITHIN A STATE FROM ONE PERSONAGE TO ANOTHER
THE SECOND METHOD IS CORRUPTION
THE MINORITY CONSCIOUSLY ADOPT CERTAIN RATIONAL PRINCIPLES THROUGH THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH REASON WHILE THE MAJORITY ACT ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES UNCONSCIOUSLY BECAUSE IT IS REQUIRED BY PUBLIC OPINION
QUOTING THESE CASES HE SHOWS THAT IT IS PRECISELY IN THEM THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE IS BOTH NECESSARY AND REASONABLE
BUT I DOUBT IF IT CAN PROVE HISTORY NATURE AND GOD IN ERROR ALSO
SIR YOU YOURSELF SPEAK OF THE PACIFIC IDEAL INSPIRING YOUR GENEROUS COMPATRIOTS AS A DREAM
THE SUBTLE INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE SOCIAL POSITION THE ANALYSIS OF THE FRAME OF MIND OF OPPRESSORS AND OPPRESSED AND OF THE INTOXICATION OF AUTHORITY AND SERVILITY AS WELL AS THE PURELY DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGES IN THE LAST CHAPTER--THESE COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM THE AUTHOR OF WAR AND PEACE THE BOOK WILL SURELY GIVE ALL CLASSES OF READERS MUCH TO THINK OF AND MUST CALL FORTH MUCH CRITICISM
BUT ONE COULD SEE BY THEIR FACES AND THEIR AVERTED EYES THAT THEY WERE ASHAMED
I SEE ALL THIS I
4 THAT THE MEMORIAL ADOPTED BY THIS CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT TO THE HEADS OF THE CIVILIZED STATES SHOULD AS FAR AS PRACTICABLE BE PRESENTED TO EACH POWER BY INFLUENTIAL DEPUTATIONS
DEVOTING HIS LIFE TO THE RECOGNITION AND FULFILLMENT OF THE TRUTH REVEALED TO HIM HE IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH THE SOURCE OF UNIVERSAL LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHES ACTS NOT PERSONAL AND DEPENDENT ON CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND TIME BUT ACTS UNCONDITIONED BY PREVIOUS CAUSES ACTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE CAUSES OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND HAVE AN INFINITE UNLIMITED SIGNIFICANCE
A DOCTOR A SPECIALIST IN INSANITY TOLD A STORY THAT ONE SUMMER DAY WHEN HE WAS LEAVING THE ASYLUM THE LUNATICS ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE STREET DOOR
WE SEE ALSO THAT THIS ORGANIZATION OF LIFE MUST INEVITABLY BE OUR RUIN IF IT CONTINUES
A RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO THE CONVENERS AND MEMBERS OF THE SECTIONAL COMMITTEES
IN MONTESQUIEU'S TIME IT WAS SAID THAT THE CAUSE OF THE MAINTENANCE OF GREAT ARMAMENTS WAS THE DESPOTIC POWER OF KINGS WHO MADE WAR IN THE HOPE OF AUGMENTING BY CONQUEST THEIR PERSONAL REVENUES AND GAINING GLORY
ALL THE OFFICERS AND FUNCTIONARIES WHO ACCOMPANY HIM EXPERIENCE IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE THE SAME EMOTIONS
AND MEN OF THIS WAY OF THINKING BRING FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF THEIR VIEWS ARGUMENTS WHICH THEY THINK IRREFUTABLE DRAWN FROM HISTORY PHILOSOPHY AND EVEN RELIGION
QUITE THE CONTRARY IF HE CAN ONLY GET AT HIM HE WILL RUN HIM THROUGH WITH HIS BAYONET
TO TAKE FROM THE PEOPLE--OFTEN IN POVERTY--TAXES TO BE SPENT ON CONSTRUCTING CANNON TORPEDOES AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF BUTCHERY SO AS TO MAKE WAR ON PEOPLE WITH WHOM WE WISH TO BE AT PEACE AND WHO FEEL THE SAME WISH IN REGARD TO US
THE BOOK HAS A SPECIAL INTEREST FOR THIS REASON ALONE
A DIPLOMATIC CONGRESS TO BE HELD EVERY YEAR
ONE NEED ONLY GLANCE DURING A REVIEW AT THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF INTOXICATED WITH SELF-IMPORTANCE FOLLOWED BY HIS RETINUE ALL ON MAGNIFICENT AND GAYLY APPARELED HORSES IN SPLENDID UNIFORMS AND WEARING DECORATIONS AND SEE HOW THEY RIDE TO THE HARMONIOUS AND SOLEMN STRAINS OF MUSIC BEFORE THE RANKS OF SOLDIERS ALL PRESENTING ARMS AND PETRIFIED WITH SERVILITY
THE RESULT OF SUCH A MEANS OF CONFIRMING THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE MORE THESE CONFIRMATIONS OF TRUTH BY TALES OF MIRACLES WERE HEAPED UP ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE MORE THE DOCTRINE WAS DISTORTED FROM ITS ORIGINAL MEANING AID THE MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE IT BECAME
YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE
E
E
STILL MORE STRANGE AND EVEN UNREASONABLE SEEMED THE STATE DUTIES OF SUBMITTING TO THE APPOINTED AUTHORITY AND PAYING TAXES AND FIGHTING IN DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY AND SO ON
THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS BAD IN THIS RESPECT AND THAT RESPECT
FOR THE MAN WHO SUBMITS THE ADVANTAGES WILL BE THAT AFTER EXPOSING HIMSELF TO ALL THE HUMILIATION AND PERFORMING ALL THE BARBARITIES REQUIRED OF HIM HE MAY IF HE ESCAPES BEING KILLED GET A DECORATION OF RED OR GOLD TINSEL TO STICK ON HIS CLOWN'S DRESS
IT IS BETTER FOR HIS PERSONAL WELFARE FOR HIM TO SUBMIT AND HE SUBMITS
AND THEY SOLEMNLY STRANGLE A FEW DEFENSELESS CREATURES
THE MOST BEWILDERING THING IS THAT THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY IS NOT IN REVOLT AT THE WORD WAR AH
IN ANY CASE THE CAUSE OF HIS ACTION IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY GIVEN PREVIOUS FACT BUT IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A GIVEN RELATION TO TRUTH AND THE CONSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF THIS OR THAT FACT AS A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR ACTION
THIS IS JUST THE CONDITION OF THE AVERAGE MAN OF OUR CHRISTIAN SOCIETY
AFTER REFERRING TO THE SAME NUMBER NINE MILLIONS OF THE ACTIVE ARMY AND FIFTEEN MILLIONS OF RESERVE AND THE ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE OF GOVERNMENTS ON THE SUPPORT AND ARMING OF THESE FORCES HE SAYS
JUST AS THE INDIVIDUAL MAN CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT HAVING SOME THEORY OF THE MEANING OF HIS LIFE AND IS ALWAYS THOUGH OFTEN UNCONSCIOUSLY FRAMING HIS CONDUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEANING HE ATTRIBUTES TO HIS LIFE SO TOO ASSOCIATIONS OF MEN LIVING IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS--NATIONS--CANNOT BUT HAVE THEORIES OF THE MEANING OF THEIR ASSOCIATED LIFE AND CONDUCT ENSUING FROM THOSE THEORIES
AND HE KNOWS THAT ALL THIS IS GOING ON IN A WORLD IN WHICH IT IS A RECOGNIZED SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE THAT LABOR ALONE CREATES WEALTH AND THAT TO PROFIT BY THE LABOR OF OTHERS IS IMMORAL DISHONEST AND PUNISHABLE BY LAW
NOWADAYS AFTER SO MANY CENTURIES OF FRUITLESS EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR LIFE SECURE BY THE PAGAN ORGANIZATION OF LIFE IT MUST BE EVIDENT TO EVERYONE THAT ALL EFFORTS IN THAT DIRECTION ONLY INTRODUCE FRESH DANGERS INTO PERSONAL AND SOCIAL LIFE AND DO NOT RENDER IT MORE SECURE IN ANY WAY
AND SUCH AN OBSERVATION IS JUST BUT ONLY SO FAR AS IT REFERS TO THE GOVERNMENT WHICH AIDS THE CHURCH IN ITS TASK OF STULTIFICATION AND CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA
THE POVERTY OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT THE RESULT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND NOR OF CAPITALISTIC OPPRESSION BUT OF OTHER CAUSES
AND THEY NOT ONLY DO NOT TEACH TEAT WE SHOULD AVOID TEMPTATIONS TO BREAK IT CHIEF OF WHICH IS THE MILITARY OATH BUT THEY THEMSELVES ADMINISTER IT
HE DOES NOT REFUSE TO GO AND STAND NEAR THE HAYSTACKS WHERE THEY PLACE HIM BUT REFUSES TO TAKE HIS ARMS DECLARING THAT HE WILL NOT USE VIOLENCE IN ANY CASE AGAINST ANYONE
THE SAME DECLARATION IS MADE BY A PEASANT IN TVER ANOTHER IN TAMBOV
WE REGARD AS UNCHRISTIAN AND UNLAWFUL NOT ONLY ALL WARS WHETHER OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE BUT ALL PREPARATIONS FOR WAR
IF THE LABORER HAS NO LAND IF HE CANNOT USE THE NATURAL RIGHT OF EVERY MAN TO DERIVE SUBSISTENCE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY OUT OF THE LAND THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WISH IT TO BE SO BUT BECAUSE A CERTAIN SET OF MEN THE LAND-OWNERS HAVE APPROPRIATED THE RIGHT OF GIVING OR REFUSING ADMITTANCE TO THE LAND TO THE LABORERS
IT WAS NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A GOOD THING NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL TO MEN AND THE CONTRARY COURSE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EVIL BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE WILL OF THOSE IN POWER THAT NICE WAS INCORPORATED INTO FRANCE AND LORRAINE INTO GERMANY AND BOHEMIA INTO AUSTRIA AND THAT POLAND WAS DIVIDED AND IRELAND AND INDIA RULED BY THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE CHINESE ARE ATTACKED AND THE AFRICANS SLAUGHTERED AND THE CHINESE PREVENTED FROM IMMIGRATING BY THE AMERICANS AND THE JEWS PERSECUTED BY THE RUSSIANS AND THAT LANDOWNERS APPROPRIATE LANDS THEY DO NOT CULTIVATE AND CAPITALISTS ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THE LABOR OF OTHERS
A MAN CANNOT BE PLACED AGAINST HIS WILL IN A SITUATION OPPOSED TO HIS CONSCIENCE
A MODERATE PERFECTION LOSES ITS POWER OF INFLUENCING MEN'S HEARTS
TO MEET THIS NEED HUMANITY HAS THE SPECIAL POWER OF PRODUCING MEN WHO GIVE A NEW MEANING TO THE WHOLE OF HUMAN LIFE--A THEORY OF LIFE FROM WHICH FOLLOW NEW FORMS OF ACTIVITY QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ALL PRECEDING THEM
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A SOCIETY HAS ARISEN OF LATE BEARING THE NAME OF THE HINSCHISTS THESE FACTS ARE TAKEN FROM THE PEACE HERALD JULY 1891 THE MEMBERS OF WHICH REFUSE TO ENTER MILITARY SERVICE ON THE GROUNDS OF THEIR CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES
AND IT DEPENDS UPON US TO MAKE THIS EFFORT
FOR IN THAT ARGUMENT THEY DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY OTHER MEANS BESIDES THE INWARD SPIRITUAL ONE BY WHICH MEN ASSIMILATE A NEW TRUTH AND PASS FROM ONE ORDER OF LIFE TO ANOTHER
IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE SO-CALLED CRIMINALS LIVING IN OUR MIDST
AND THAT WE ALL KNOW
THE CONGRESS BELIEVES THAT THE WARLIKE PREJUDICES AND TRADITIONS WHICH ARE STILL FOSTERED IN THE VARIOUS NATIONALITIES AND THE MISREPRESENTATIONS BY LEADERS OF PUBLIC OPINION IN LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES OR THROUGH THE PRESS ARE OFTEN INDIRECT CAUSES OF WAR AND THAT THESE EVILS SHOULD BE COUNTERACTED BY THE PUBLICATION OF ACCURATE INFORMATION TENDING TO THE REMOVAL OF MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS AND RECOMMENDS THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF COMMENCING AN INTERNATIONAL NEWSPAPER WITH SUCH A PURPOSE
AND THAT IS THE FIRST COMMAND
TRULY WE NEED ONLY IMAGINE OURSELVES IN THE POSITION OF ANY GROWN-UP MAN NOT NECESSARILY EDUCATED EVEN THE SIMPLEST MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WHO HAS PICKED UP THE IDEAS THAT ARE EVERYWHERE IN THE AIR NOWADAYS OF GEOLOGY PHYSICS CHEMISTRY COSMOGRAPHY OR HISTORY WHEN HE FOR THE FIRST TIME CONSCIOUSLY COMPARES THEM WITH THE ARTICLES OF BELIEF INSTILLED INTO HIM IN CHILDHOOD AND MAINTAINED BY THE CHURCHES--THAT GOD CREATED THE WORLD IN SIX DAYS AND LIGHT BEFORE THE SUN
AS THOUGH WHILE ONE SET OF MEN HAVE BEEN AT WORK A LONG WHILE TURNING A RIVER INTO A NEW CHANNEL AND HAD DUG OUT A COMPLETE WATER-COURSE AND HAD ONLY TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES FOR THE WATER TO RUSH IN AND DO THE REST ANOTHER SET OF MEN SHOULD COME ALONG AND BEGIN TO ADVISE THEM THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER INSTEAD OF LETTING THE WATER OUT TO CONSTRUCT A MACHINE WHICH WOULD LADLE THE WATER UP FROM ONE SIDE AND POUR IT OVER THE OTHER SIDE
THIS IS THE STATE NOT ONLY OF THOSE WHO WERE GOING ON THIS EXPEDITION BUT OF ALL MEN WHO FULFILL THEIR STATE AND SOCIAL DUTIES IN PREFERENCE TO AND IN DETRIMENT OF THEIR HUMAN DUTIES
THEY BECOME THE RICHER THE MORE SUBMISSIVELY THEY CARRY OUT THE WILL OF THE GOVERNMENT
VIOLENCE NO LONGER RESTS ON THE BELIEF IN ITS UTILITY BUT ONLY ON THE FACT OF ITS HAVING EXISTED SO LONG AND BEING ORGANIZED BY THE RULING CLASSES WHO PROFIT BY IT SO THAT THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THEIR AUTHORITY CANNOT EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM IT
BUT THESE PRECEPTS FAR FROM CONSTITUTING THE WHOLE OF CHRIST'S TEACHING AND EXHAUSTING IT ARE SIMPLY STAGES ON THE WAY TO PERFECTION
HE CERTAINLY WON'T LOVE HIS ENEMY
WHAT FORCES THESE MEN TO THE FALSE REASONING THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS UNCHANGING AND THAT THEREFORE THEY OUGHT TO SUPPORT IT WHEN IT IS SO OBVIOUS ON THE CONTRARY THAT IT IS ONLY UNCHANGING BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES SUPPORT IT
BUT THESE SAVAGES WITHIN AND WITHOUT CHRISTIAN SOCIETY WHO ARE SUCH A TERROR TO US HAVE NEVER BEEN SUBJUGATED BY VIOLENCE AND ARE NOT SUBJUGATED BY IT NOW
INDEED IT IS ONLY BECAUSE THIS STATE OF UNIVERSAL ARMAMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT GRADUALLY AND IMPERCEPTIBLY AND BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS HAVE EXERTED IN MAINTAINING IT EVERY RESOURCE OF INTIMIDATION CORRUPTION BRUTALIZATION AND VIOLENCE THAT WE DO NOT SEE ITS FLAGRANT INCONSISTENCY WITH THE CHRISTIAN IDEAS AND SENTIMENTS BY WHICH THE MODERN WORLD IS PERMEATED
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO SUPPOSE THIS WITH THE INEXACT HEATHEN DEFINITION OF GOOD
HE IS ALREADY CONSCIOUS OF A CHANGE IN PUBLIC OPINION WHICH CONDEMNS WHAT WAS FORMERLY A DUTY
THE LOST SHEEP IS DEARER THAN NINETY-NINE THAT WERE NOT LOST
SHARE ALL THAT YOU HAVE WITH OTHERS DO NOT HEAP UP RICHES DO NOT STEAL DO NOT CAUSE SUFFERING DO NOT KILL DO NOT UNTO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD NOT THEY SHOULD DO UNTO YOU ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID NOT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH OF THIS LAW IF IT WERE NOT FOR HYPOCRISY
NO WAR TO BE DECLARED TILL TWO MONTHS AFTER THE INCIDENT WHICH PROVOKED IT
IF CHRISTIANITY HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO MEN IN ITS TRUE UNCORRUPTED FORM IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE MAJORITY WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN AS UNTOUCHED BY IT AS THE NATIONS OF ASIA ARE NOW
IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LANDOWNER PREFERS TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS INEVITABLE AND IMMUTABLE BECAUSE THIS EXISTING ORDER SECURES HIM AN INCOME FROM HIS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF ACRES BY MEANS OF WHICH HE CAN LEAD HIS HABITUAL INDOLENT AND LUXURIOUS LIFE
MORE CRUEL BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR IT BECAUSE IT IS ABSURD BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD TO NO GOOD
IS NOT THE LIFE MORE THAN MEAT AND THE BODY THAN RAINMENT
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT IS SACRED TO THE CIVILIZED MAN OF TO-DAY
AND NON-CHRISTIAN MEN ALWAYS DO SAY AND THINK AND ACT ON THIS REASONING
AS FOR THE GOVERNMENT--THAT MEANS THE TZARS MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS WITH PENS IN THEIR HANDS WHO CANNOT FORCE US INTO DOING ANYTHING AS THAT OFFICER OF POLICE COMPELLED THE PEASANTS
THAT AS LANDOWNER OR CAPITALIST YOU ARE BOUND TO BASE YOUR WHOLE LIFE ON THE OPPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A MAN LIVING IN THIS WAY WAS AN EVIL EGOISTIC CREATURE AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY CONSIDER HIMSELF A CHRISTIAN OR A LIBERAL
MILITARY EXPLOITS ARE OPENLY REPROBATED BY THE MILITARY THEMSELVES AND ARE OFTEN THE SUBJECT OF JESTS AMONG THEM
EVERYONE MOVING FROM HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE IS BOUND TO CARRY ONE AND TO PAY A DUTY ON IT
LET YOUR CARE BEFORE ALL THINGS BE TO OBEY THE ORDERS AND INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN YOU
THE REVOLUTIONISTS SAY
IN THE FIRST THEORY OF LIFE A MAN'S LIFE IS LIMITED TO HIS ONE INDIVIDUALITY
IN THE FIRST CASE IF HE RECOGNIZES THE TRUTH IN SPITE OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM IT HE PREPARES FOR HIMSELF IN THE FUTURE A WHOLE SERIES OF ACTS OF SELF-SACRIFICE NECESSARILY FLOWING FROM THIS RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH
IT WAS THE RECRUITING SESSION
BUT HOWEVER POWERFUL THIS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE MAY BE IT IS NOT THE CHIEF NOR THE MOST PERNICIOUS ACTIVITY OF THE CHURCH
THUS THE TRUTH OF THE TEACHING WAS NOT PROVED BY ITS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE NEEDS OF THE MIND AND THE WHOLE NATURE OF MAN BUT BY THE MIRACULOUS MANNER OF ITS TRANSMISSION WHICH WAS ADVANCED AS AN IRREFUTABLE PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF THE INTERPRETATION PUT ON IT
IT RECOGNIZES THE NECESSITY OF AN INFINITE EXTENSION OF THE SPHERE OF LOVE
IN SPITE OF THESE DISPUTES AND OPPOSITION HOWEVER THE OFFICER OF POLICE GAVE ORDERS THAT SOME WOMAN WHICHEVER CAME FIRST SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM EACH HOUSEHOLD AND LED AWAY TO PRISON
WHAT'S THIS MEETING ABOUT EVERYONE LOOKED AT THE POLICEMAN AND ONE OF THE SPEAKERS A QUIET MAN IN A PEASANT'S DRESS ANSWERED WITH A CALM AND GRACIOUS AIR WE ARE SPEAKING OF SERIOUS MATTERS AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO MOVE ON
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS BUT I TAKE A STIPEND FOR PREACHING A FALSE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WHICH I DO NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IN AND WHICH ONLY SERVE'S TO HINDER MEN FROM UNDERSTANDING TRUE CHRISTIANITY
SPEAK LOUDER THE COLONEL WITH SHINING EPAULETS SHOUTS TO HIM
IF AFTER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS THERE ARE STILL SO MANY EAGER FOR POWER AND SO FEW ANXIOUS TO OBEY THERE SEEMS NO LIKELIHOOD OF ITS HAPPENING VERY SOON--OR INDEED OF ITS EVER HAPPENING AT ALL
FOR PRAYER PRIESTS MINISTERS OF VARIOUS CHRISTIAN SECTS ARE ALWAYS PRESENT AS INDISPENSABLY AS THE HANGMAN AT EXECUTIONS AND SANCTION BY THEIR PRESENCE THE COMPATIBILITY OF MURDER WITH CHRISTIANITY A CLERGYMAN ASSISTED AT THE ATTEMPT AT MURDER BY ELECTRICITY IN AMERICA)--BUT SUCH FACTS CAUSE NO ONE ANY SURPRISE
OF THE BOOK WHAT I BELIEVE"--THE CORRESPONDENCE EVOKED BY IT--LETTERS FROM QUAKERS--GARRISON'S DECLARATION--ADIN BALLOU HIS WORKS HIS CATECHISM--HELCHITSKY'S NET OF FAITH"--THE ATTITUDE OF THE WORLD TO WORKS ELUCIDATING CHRIST'S TEACHING--DYMOND'S BOOK ON WAR"--MUSSER'S NON-RESISTANCE ASSERTED"--ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT IN 1818 TO MEN WHO REFUSED TO SERVE IN THE ARMY--HOSTILE ATTITUDE OF GOVERNMENTS GENERALLY AND OF LIBERALS TO THOSE WHO REFUSE TO ASSIST IN ACTS OF STATE VIOLENCE AND THEIR CONSCIOUS EFFORTS TO SILENCE AND SUPPRESS THESE MANIFESTATIONS OF CHRISTIAN NON-RESISTANCE
ONE DAY BY PETER III THE NEXT BY CATHERINE AND THE DAY AFTER BY POUGACHEF
HOWEVER OBSCURE HIS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AFFAIR IS TO EACH AND HOWEVER STRONG THE IDEA INSTILLED INTO ALL OF THEM THAT THEY ARE NOT MEN BUT GOVERNORS OFFICIALS OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AND AS SUCH BEINGS CAN VIOLATE EVERY HUMAN DUTY THE NEARER THEY APPROACH THE PLACE OF THE EXECUTION THE STRONGER THEIR DOUBTS AS TO ITS BEING RIGHT AND THIS DOUBT WILL REACH ITS HIGHEST POINT WHEN THE VERY MOMENT FOR CARRYING IT OUT HAS COME
ALL OF THEM IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES KNOW HOW TO STAND UP FOR THEIR PRINCIPLES
THE HIGHER AND THE MORE PROFITABLE A MAN'S POSITION THE MORE UNSTABLE IT BECOMES AND THE MORE TERRIBLE AND DANGEROUS A FALL FROM IT FOR HIM THE MORE FIRMLY THE MAN BELIEVES IN THE EXISTING ORDER AND THEREFORE WITH THE MORE EASE OF CONSCIENCE CAN SUCH A MAN PERPETRATE CRUEL AND WICKED ACTS AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT IN HIS OWN INTEREST BUT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT ORDER
JAILERS AND OVERSEERS OF GALLEYS GENERALLY BECOME THE CHAMPIONS OF THOSE WHOM THEY OUGHT TO TORTURE
CHAPTER X
THERE IS SOMETHING SICKLY IN THIS DREAD WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS IN WHICH MANY OF US LIVE AND HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP
HE WHO ATTACKS ANOTHER AND INJURES HIM KINDLES IN THE OTHER A FEELING OF HATRED THE ROOT OF EVERY EVIL
AND SO TOO FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES OF CHRISTIANITY THERE WERE MEN WHO BEGAN TO ASSERT ON THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THAT THE MEANING THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THE DOCTRINE IS THE ONLY TRUE ONE AND AS PROOF BRING FORWARD SUPERNATURAL OCCURRENCES IN SUPPORT OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THEIR INTERPRETATION
IN ALL OF THEM HERESY IS THE SUBJECT WHICH FIRST PRESENTS ITSELF FOR DEFINITION
FOR IT MAY COME ANY TIME IN SUCH AN HOUR AS YE THINK NOT
WHEN YOU ASK THE LEAST WARLIKE OF ACADEMICIANS WHETHER HE IS A PARTISAN OF WAR HIS ANSWER IS KNOWN BEFOREHAND
AND IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE SINCE APART FROM THE DEMORALIZING INFLUENCE OF POWER THE POLICY OR EVEN THE UNCONSCIOUS TENDENCY OF THOSE IN POWER WILL ALWAYS BE TO REDUCE THEIR SUBJECTS TO THE EXTREME OF WEAKNESS FOR THE WEAKER THE OPPRESSED THE LESS EFFORT NEED BE MADE TO KEEP HIM IN SUBJECTION
THIS HYPNOTIZING PROCESS IS ORGANIZED AT THE PRESENT IN THE MOST COMPLEX MANNER AND STARTING FROM THEIR EARLIEST CHILDHOOD CONTINUES TO ACT ON MEN TILL THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH
5 THAT THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTIONS BE ADOPTED
THE MOST CONVENIENT THING FOR THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE TO KILL THE NON-RESISTANT BY FLOGGING HIM TO DEATH OR SOME OTHER MEANS AS WAS DONE IN FORMER DAYS
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAW OF LOVE IMPLANTED BY OUR COMMON FATHER IN OUR HEARTS
A MAN WHO REGARDED THE HEAVENS AS A SOLID FINITE VAULT COULD BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE THAT GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS THAT THE HEAVENS OPENED THAT CHRIST ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN BUT FOR US ALL THESE PHRASES HAVE NO SENSE WHATEVER
OR IN INCULCATING SAVAGE AND IDOLATROUS SUPERSTITIOUS IN THE PLACE OF THE LAW OF CHRIST
IN ORDER TO GIVE AN IDEA OF HOW SUCH THINGS ARE DONE I WILL DESCRIBE A PROCEEDING OF THE KIND WHICH TOOK PLACE IN OREL AND RECEIVED THE FULL APPROVAL OF THE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES
BUT RULING MEANS USING FORCE AND USING FORCE MEANS DOING TO HIM TO WHOM FORCE IS USED WHAT HE DOES NOT LIKE AND WHAT HE WHO USES THE FORCE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT LIKE DONE TO HIMSELF
PEOPLE OUGHT TO REALIZE THE SAME FACT WHEN THEY READ BOOKS AND ARTICLES ON ARBITRATION AND DISARMAMENT
THEN IT IS INSTILLED INTO THE CHILD AS IT IS BROUGHT UP THAT AT THE SIGHT OF ANY CHURCH OR IKON HE MUST REPEAT THE SAME ACTION--I
IF YOU WOULD NOT OBEY THE WHOLE ARGUMENT FALLS TO THE GROUND FOR IF YOU CAN DISOBEY THE GOVERNORS IN ONE CASE WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE UP TO WHICH YOU CAN OBEY THEM
ONE OF THESE CAUSES IS THE FACT THAT BELIEVERS AND UNBELIEVERS ALIKE ARE FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT THEY HAVE UNDERSTOOD CHRIST'S TEACHING A LONG TIME AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND IT SO FULLY INDUBITABLY AND CONCLUSIVELY THAT IT CAN HAVE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANCE THAN THE ONE THEY ATTRIBUTE TO IT
A MAN WITH THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CANNOT RESIST
AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR THEY SET HIM FREE BEFORE THE END OF HIS TERM OF IMPRISONMENT RECKONING IT CONTRARY TO LAW TO KEEP HIM IN PRISON AFTER HIS TIME OF MILITARY SERVICE WAS OVER AND ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THEY CERTAINLY ALL HAVE MOTHERS SOME OF THEM WIVES AND CHILDREN
IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR HEARTS THEY ALL KNOW THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS SHAMEFUL THAT TO TAKE PART IN IT IS A DISCREDIT AND BLEMISH IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE WHOSE OPINION THEY VALUE
AND WHEN PETER III
SECONDLY RELIGION IS ALWAYS THE THEORY OF THE PRACTICE OF THE FUTURE AND NOT OF THE PAST AND THEREFORE IT IS CLEAR THAT INVESTIGATION OF PAST MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT IN ANY CASE GRASP THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION
TAX-GATHERERS WHO TRY TO PERFORM AS LITTLE AS THEY CAN OF THEIR DUTIES AND RICH MEN RENOUNCING THEIR WEALTH--THEN THE SAME THING WILL INEVITABLY HAPPEN TO OTHER RULERS OTHER SOLDIERS OTHER JUDGES PRIESTS TAX-GATHERERS AND RICH MEN
THE FIRST TO COME FORWARD WAS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY A MAN OF FORTY WHO HAD ALWAYS STOOD UP MANFULLY FOR THE RIGHTS OF HIS CLASS AND THEREFORE WAS HELD IN THE GREATEST ESTEEM BY ALL THE VILLAGERS
ALL THIS TAKES PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER SOLDIERS
YES
MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY CAN REPEAT THESE WORDS WITH THEIR LIPS BUT BELIEVE THEM THEY CANNOT
IN THE MOST BRUTAL WORDS HE FRANKLY EXPOSES ALL THE HORRORS AND CRIMINALITY FOR WHICH MEN PREPARE THEMSELVES IN ENTERING THE ARMY AND THE DEPTHS OF IGNOMINY TO WHICH THEY FALL IN PROMISING OBEDIENCE
WHERE DOES IT END AND WHERE DOES IT BEGIN
LOOKING FROM HIS YACHT AT THE DRILL AND FIRING PRACTICE OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS THE FOLLOWING REFLECTIONS OCCUR TO HIM
THAT IS THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE AND WAR
THE EMPEROR UNDRESSES AND PUTS ON HIS NEW CLOTHES THAT IS TO SAY REMAINS NAKED AND NAKED HE WALKS THROUGH THE TOWN
SUCH WAS THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPIRITUAL CRITICS--I
SO MUCH FOR THE FOURTH REPLY
THOUGH SOME NON-CHRISTIAN IDEALS SUCH AS STRENGTH COURAGE AND WEALTH ARE STILL WORSHIPED BY A FEW WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PENETRATED BY THE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT THESE IDEALS ARE OUT OF DATE AND ARE ABANDONED IF NOT BY ALL AT LEAST BY ALL THOSE REGARDED AS THE BEST PEOPLE
THEY WILL MARCH WITHOUT REVOLT PASSIVE RESIGNED--THOUGH THE NUMBERS AND THE STRENGTH ARE THEIRS AND THEY MIGHT IF THEY KNEW HOW TO CO-OPERATE TOGETHER ESTABLISH THE REIGN OF GOOD SENSE AND FRATERNITY INSTEAD OF THE BARBAROUS TRICKERY OF DIPLOMACY
THEY SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION AS PLAINLY AS IT WAS PUT IN MY BOOK--DID CHRIST REALLY DEMAND FROM HIS DISCIPLES THAT THEY SHOULD CARRY OUT WHAT HE TAUGHT THEM IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT
THEY MOSTLY LEAVE THE DECISION OF SUCH QUESTIONS TO GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS OR TO PUBLIC OPINION
HUMAN LIFE IS A COMBINATION OF THE ANIMAL LIFE AND THE DIVINE LIFE
THE GOVERNOR ON ARRIVING STEPPED OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE DELIVERED A PREPARED HARANGUE AND ASKED FOR THE CULPRITS AND A BENCH
AND EVEN THAT IS NOT ALL
TO OVERLOOK SUCH A REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE DEMANDS OF THE AUTHORITIES IS OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT TO PUT SUCH A CASE ON A PAR WITH SIMPLE BREACH OF DISCIPLINE IS ALSO OUT OF THE QUESTION
TAKE THEREFORE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW
TO BEGIN WITH HE SO TERRIFIED THE PEASANTS BY HIS LOUD THREATS THAT REDUCED TO SUBMISSION BY HIM THEY SET TO WORK TO FLOG ONE ANOTHER AT HIS COMMAND
ANOTHER NO LESS GIFTED WRITER EDOUARD ROD PAINTS IN STILL MORE VIVID COLORS THE CRUELTY AND MADNESS OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS
IF I BELONG TO THE MINORITY OF OPPRESSORS THE DISADVANTAGES OF NON-COMPLIANCE WILL CONSIST IN MY BEING BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT FOR REFUSING TO PERFORM MY DUTIES TO THE STATE AND IF I AM LUCKY BEING ACQUITTED OR AS IS DONE IN THE CASE OF THE MENNONITES IN RUSSIA BEING SET TO WORK OUT MY MILITARY SERVICE AT SOME CIVIL OCCUPATION FOR THE STATE
IF THEY DO COME TO THEMSELVES NOT ONLY THIS TERRIBLE CRIME WILL NOT BE PERPETRATED BUT MANY ALSO WHO HEAR OF THE TURN THE AFFAIR HAS TAKEN WILL BE EMANCIPATED FROM THE HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD OR AT LEAST WILL BE NEARER BEING EMANCIPATED FROM IT
A LADY OF LIBERAL VIEWS WHO WAS TRAVELING IN THE SAME TRAIN WITH US SEEING THE GOVERNOR AND THE OFFICERS IN THE FIRST-CLASS SALOON AND LEARNING THE OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION BEGAN INTENTIONALLY RAISING HER VOICE SO THAT THEY SHOULD HEAR TO ABUSE THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS AND TO CRY SHAME ON MEN WHO WOULD TAKE PART IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS
FAMILY CLAN TRIBE OR STATE
THUS IT WAS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES AND SO IT WENT ON CONSTANTLY INCREASING TILL IT REACHED IN OUR DAY THE LOGICAL CLIMAX OF THE DOGMAS OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION AND THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE OR OF THE BISHOPS OR OF SCRIPTURE AND OF REQUIRING A BLIND FAITH RENDERED INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND UTTERLY MEANINGLESS NOT IN GOD BUT IN CHRIST NOT IN A DOCTRINE BUT IN A PERSON AS IN CATHOLICISM OR IN PERSONS AS IN GREEK ORTHODOXY OR IN A BOOK AS IN PROTESTANTISM
SO MUCH FOR THE ATTITUDE TO WAR OF THOSE WHO REGARD IT AS SOMETHING TRAGIC AND FATED BY DESTINY
2 THAT THE QUESTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL PEACE EMBLEM BE POSTPONED SINE DIE
THE MAN WITH THE CIGARETTE--HE IS THE DOCTOR--COMES UP AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE RECRUIT'S FACE BUT SOMEWHERE BEYOND IT FEELS HIS BODY OVER WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST MEASURES HIM TESTS HIM TELLS THE GUARD TO OPEN HIS MOUTH TELLS HIM TO BREATHE TO SPEAK
THE PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION OF THE PUBLICAN ZACCHEUS OF THE WOMAN THAT WAS A SINNER OF THE ROBBER ON THE CROSS IS A GREATER STATE OF BLESSEDNESS ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE THAN THE STATIONARY RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE PHARISEE
THE OPINION OF ANOTHER WELL-KNOWN ACADEMICIAN JULES CLARETIE IS OF THE SAME KIND
MEN OF THE PRESENT CAN ONLY BELIEVE AS INDEED THEY DO THAT THEY OUGHT TO BELIEVE IN THIS
LORD GOD TO CALMLY AND MEEKLY ABIDE THE DOCTRINE
SOMEONE NOTES SOMETHING DOWN
I SEE ANOTHER DANGER NEARER AND FAR MORE CRUEL
AND THEN THE GALLOWS IS ERECTED
MONUMENTS AND MEMORIALS IN THESE DAYS ARE MOSTLY NOT ERECTED IN HONOR OF GOVERNMENT DIGNITARIES OR GENERALS OR STILL LESS OF RICH MEN BUT RATHER OF ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE AND INVENTORS PERSONS WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND OFTEN HAVE EVEN BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH IT
IN SIX MONTHS THE GENERALS HAVE DESTROYED THE WORK OF TWENTY YEARS OF EFFORT OF PATIENCE AND OF GENIUS
SO THAT ALTHOUGH POWER REMAINS EXTERNALLY THE SAME AS IT WAS WITH EVERY CHANGE OF THE MEN IN POWER THERE IS A CONSTANT INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY EXPERIENCE TO THE NECESSITY OF ASSIMILATING THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND WITH EVERY CHANGE--THOUGH IT IS THE COARSEST CRUDEST AND LEAST CHRISTIAN WHO COME INTO POSSESSION OF POWER THEY ARE LESS COARSE AND CRUEL AND MORE CHRISTIAN THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS WHEN THEY GAINED POSSESSION OF POWER
THE EXCITED CROWD GENERALLY DELUDED BY THEIR LEADERS DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITY IS SAYING IN THE POMPOUS OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND THEIR EXCITEMENT CONTINUES
ALL THE ORDINARY OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE FROM THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS ARE BROUGHT FORWARD SUCH AS THE EXPULSION OF THE MONEYCHANGERS FROM THE TEMPLE AND SO ON AND ARGUMENTS FOLLOW IN DISPROOF OF THEM ALL
ALL THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE BECAUSE THE AUTHORITIES ARE CONFIDENTLY ASSURED THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS THESE SERVILE TOOLS AT HAND READY TO CARRY ALL THEIR DEMANDS INTO EFFECT BY MEANS OF TORTURE AND MURDER
HE BELIEVED THAT HIS FORM OF RELIGION WAS THE ONE TRUE ONE
THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE WORKING UNDERGROUND IN THE WATER OR IN STIFLING HEAT FOR TEN TO FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY AT NIGHT IN FACTORIES TO MANUFACTURE OBJECTS FOR OUR PLEASURE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS INTOXICATION MEN IMAGINE THEMSELVES NO LONGER SIMPLY MEN AS THEY ARE BUT SOME SPECIAL BEINGS--NOBLEMEN MERCHANTS GOVERNORS JUDGES OFFICERS TZARS MINISTERS OR SOLDIERS--NO LONGER BOUND BY ORDINARY HUMAN DUTIES BUT BY OTHER DUTIES FAR MORE WEIGHTY--THE PECULIAR DUTIES OF A NOBLEMAN MERCHANT GOVERNOR JUDGE OFFICER TZAR MINISTER OR SOLDIER
43 AND XXVI
I MEAN THE PAMPHLET OF MR TROIZKY PUBLISHED AT KAZAN A SERMON FOR THE PEOPLE THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY ACCEPTS CHRIST'S TEACHING IN ITS TRUE MEANING
BUT IS SUCH A BELIEF POSSIBLE IN THESE DAYS
THIS IS A VERY SKILLFUL DEVICE AND MANY PEOPLE WHO WISH TO BE DECEIVED ARE EASILY DECEIVED BY IT
ALL THAT HE SAID ABOUT MEEKNESS SACRIFICE LOWLINESS NOT CARING FOR THE MORROW WAS SAID BY ACCIDENT THROUGH LACK OF KNOWING HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF SCIENTIFICALLY MATT
THIS DECLARATION CAME ABOUT UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES
IN A WHOLE SERIES OF ARGUMENTS AND TEXTS SHOWING THAT WAR--THAT IS THE WOUNDING AND KILLING OF MEN--IS INCONSISTENT WITH A RELIGION FOUNDED ON PEACE AND GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN THE QUAKERS MAINTAIN AND PROVE THAT NOTHING HAS CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO THE OBSCURING OF CHRISTIAN TRUTH IN THE EYES OF THE HEATHEN AND HAS HINDERED SO MUCH THE DIFFUSION OF CHRISTIANITY THROUGH THE WORLD AS THE DISREGARD OF THIS COMMAND BY MEN CALLING THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS AND THE PERMISSION OF WAR AND VIOLENCE TO CHRISTIANS
IF THEY DO NOT COME TO THEMSELVES THE MOST FEARFUL CRIME WILL BE COMMITTED AS IN OREL AND THEN THE HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION UNDER WHICH THEY ACT WILL BE STRENGTHENED IN ALL OTHER MEN
WITH THESE OBJECTS UNDER DESPOTIC GOVERNMENTS THERE IS DIRECT PROHIBITION AGAINST PRINTING AND DISSEMINATING BOOKS TO ENLIGHTEN THE PEOPLE AND EVERYONE WHO MIGHT ROUSE THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR LETHARGY IS EXILED OR IMPRISONED
THESE THREE VIEWS OF LIFE ARE AS FOLLOWS
DIRECTLY A MAN REACHES THEM HE SEES ALL THEIR VANITY AND THEY GRADUALLY LOSE ALL THEIR POWER OF ATTRACTION
THEY ARE ADMONISHED QUESTIONED THREATENED AND PUNISHED
BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
HENCE WE DEEM IT UNLAWFUL TO BEAR ARMS AND WE CANNOT HOLD ANY OFFICE WHICH IMPOSES ON ITS INCUMBENT THE OBLIGATION TO COMPEL MEN TO DO RIGHT ON PAIN OF IMPRISONMENT OR DEATH
THE USE OF VIOLENCE ONLY WEAKENS THIS FORCE HINDERS IT AND CORRUPTS IT AND TRIES TO REPLACE IT BY ANOTHER WHICH FAR FROM BEING CONDUCIVE TO THE PROGRESS OF HUMANITY IS DETRIMENTAL TO IT
AT A TABLE BEFORE THE ZERTZAL--THE SYMBOL OF THE TZARS AUTHORITY--IN THE SEAT OF HONOR UNDER THE LIFE-SIZE PORTRAIT OF THE TZAR SIT DIGNIFIED OLD OFFICIALS WEARING DECORATIONS CONVERSING FREELY AND EASILY WRITING NOTES SUMMONING MEN BEFORE THEM AND GIVING ORDERS
AND SECONDLY FROM THE FACT THAT EVEN APART FROM CONSCIOUS SPIRITUAL LIFE MEN ARE UNCONSCIOUSLY BROUGHT INTO A MORE CHRISTIAN ATTITUDE TO LIFE BY THE VERY PROCESS OF ONE SET OF MEN GRASPING THE POWER AND AGAIN BEING REPLACED BY OTHERS
AND THINE EYE SHALL NOT PITY
THERE IS NO ONE TO-DAY WHO DOES NOT SEE THE USELESSNESS AND INJUSTICE OF COLLECTING TAXES FROM THE TOILING MASSES TO ENRICH IDLE OFFICIALS
BUT ONE MUST LEARN TO REGARD CHRIST ALWAYS IN HIS HISTORICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
CONSTANCE GARNETT
ITALICS WERE REPRESENTED HERE WITH THE SUBSTITUTION OF CAPITAL LETTERS
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PRACTICE WE MUST FIGHT
BUT WE KNOW THIS IS WHAT ALL GOVERNMENTS SAY OF ONE ANOTHER AND YET WE KNOW THAT ALL THE EUROPEAN NATIONS PROFESS THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND FRATERNITY AND THEREFORE STAND IN NO NEED OF PROTECTION AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
THIS IS WHAT AUTHORITY CONSISTS OF AND ALWAYS HAS CONSISTED OF
THE IDEAL IS TO TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT
CAN WE GET RID OF WAR
THEY LISTEN EVEN WITH SATISFACTION TO THESE DISCOURSES ENCOURAGE THEM AND TAKE PART IN THEM
THERE ARE THE SAME DIPLOMATS AND THE SAME DELIBERATIONS ON ALLIANCES AND WARS
BESIDES THESE GRACEFUL FRIVOLITIES OUR LITERATURE IS FULL OF SIMPLE NASTINESS AND BRUTALITY OF ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD LEAD MEN BACK IN THE MOST REFINED WAY TO PRIMEVAL BARBARISM TO THE PRINCIPLES NOT ONLY OF THE PAGAN BUT EVEN OF THE ANIMAL LIFE WHICH WE HAVE LEFT BEHIND US FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
AND EVERYONE THAT HEARETH THESE SAYINGS AND DOETH THEM NOT SHALL BE LIKENED UNTO A FOOLISH MAN WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON THE SAND
WHAT WILL BECOME OF HUMANITY IF EACH OF US PERFORMS THE DUTY GOD DEMANDS OF US THROUGH THE CONSCIENCE IMPLANTED WITHIN US
WHY DO MEN WHO CALL THEMSELVES LEARNED DEDICATE WHOLE LIFETIMES TO MAKING THEORIES TO PROVE THAT VIOLENCE EMPLOYED BY AUTHORITY AGAINST THE PEOPLE IS NOT VIOLENCE AT ALL BUT A SPECIAL RIGHT
AND DEVELOPING THIS METAPHOR HE SAYS
BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN."--I COR
CANON SCOTT HOLLAND REV
THEN THEY WILL BEGIN TO TRY THEM WITH THEIR BEAKS AND COME OUT OF THEM OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
AND WE MEN IN AUTHORITY WHO ARE STRIVING AGAINST THIS IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY WISE LEGISLATION WE CAPITALISTS WHO ARE COMBATING IT BY THE EXTENSION OF USEFUL INVENTIONS WE CLERGYMEN BY RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION AND WE LIBERALS BY THE FORMATION OF TRADES UNIONS AND THE DIFFUSION OF EDUCATION ARE IN THIS WAY INCREASING THE PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT CHANGING OUR OWN POSITIONS
IT TAKES THREE FORMS IN CULTIVATED SOCIETY
DIRECTLY ONE ASCENDS INTO THEM ALL THEIR SPLENDOR VANISHES
JUST IN THE SAME WAY ALL HUMANITY MAY CEASE TO DO WHAT IT REGARDS AS WRONG BUT FAR FROM BEING ABLE TO CHANGE IT CANNOT EVEN RETARD FOR A TIME THE CONTINUAL GROWTH OF A CLEARER RECOGNITION OF WHAT IS WRONG AND THEREFORE OUGHT NOT TO BE
THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE SERVED AS THE BASIS OF RELIGION BECAUSE AT THE TIME WHEN IT WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO MEN IT SEEMED TO THEM ABSOLUTELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE MYSTIC AND SUPERNATURAL
FOR SUCH SENTENCES AS THAT GOD LIVES IN HEAVEN THAT THE HEAVENS OPENED AND A VOICE FROM SOMEWHERE SAID SOMETHING THAT CHRIST ROSE AGAIN AND ASCENDED SOMEWHERE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN WILL COME FROM SOMEWHERE ON THE CLOUDS AND SO ON HAVE NO MEANING FOR US
CHRIST WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO SAY WHAT HE OUGHT BUT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AS EXACTLY AND CLEARLY AS WE CAN IN THE SPIRIT OF CRITICISM AND THEREFORE LET US CORRECT HIM
THE MAN WHO SUBMITS TO AUTHORITY DOES NOT DO AS HE CHOOSES BUT AS HE IS OBLIGED BY AUTHORITY
EVERYWHERE THE SAME STORY IS REPEATED
AND THEY WERE BOUND TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION NOT AFTER THE USUAL FASHION I
THERE THEY RECEIVE HIM AND MAKING BELIEVE TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS REFUSAL AND HIS MOTIVES FOR IT THEY AGAIN REQUEST HIM TO GO TO DRILL AND AGAIN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER SOLDIERS HE REFUSES AND EXPLAINS THE REASON OF HIS REFUSAL
IT IS CRUSHING THE SERPENT'S HEAD
BUT A GOVERNMENT OR A NATION MAY KILL AS MANY MEN AS IT CHOOSES AND THAT WILL NOT BE MURDER BUT A GREAT AND NOBLE ACTION
EVIL CANNOT BE SUPRESSED BY THE PHYSICAL FORCE OF THE GOVERNMENT--THE MORAL PROGRESS OF HUMANITY IS BROUGHT ABOUT NOT ONLY BY INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH BUT ALSO THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PUBLIC OPINION XI
IF A MAN CAN BE SAVED BY THE REDEMPTION BY SACRAMENTS AND BY PRAYER THEN HE DOES NOT NEED GOOD WORKS
THEN THEY PICK UP THE DYING THE WOUNDED AND THE DEAD COVERED WITH BLOOD SOMETIMES WOMEN AND CHILDREN AMONG THEM
THE CHURCH PREACHERS NEVER POINT OUT CASES IN WHICH THE COMMAND AGAINST FORNICATION CAN BE BROKEN AND ALWAYS TEACH THAT WE MUST AVOID SEDUCTIONS WHICH LEAD TO TEMPTATION TO FORNICATION
NO ATTENTION IS PAID TO WHAT HE SAYS AND IT IS REQUESTED THAT HE SHOULD PRONOUNCE THE WORDS OF THE OATH LIKE THE REST
BUT THIS IS NOT RIGHT
12 AND 23-25
I AM COME TO SEND A FIRE ON THE EARTH SAID CHRIST AND WHAT WILL I IF IT BE ALREADY KINDLED AND THIS FIRE IS BEGINNING TO BURN
BUT NOW WHEN THE SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN INCREASED TENFOLD AND THE PROMISED ADVANTAGES ARE DISAPPEARING IT WOULD BE A NATURAL REFLECTION THAT SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS
THUS TAUGHT NOAH MOSES AND THE PROPHETS
HENCE AS A MEASURE OF SOUND POLICY--OF SAFETY TO PROPERTY LIFE AND LIBERTY--OF PUBLIC QUIETUDE AND PRIVATE ENJOYMENT--AS WELL AS ON THE GROUND OF ALLEGIANCE TO HIM WHO IS KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS WE CORDIALLY ADOPT THE NON-RESISTANCE PRINCIPLE BEING CONFIDENT THAT IT PROVIDES FOR ALL POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES IS ARMED WITH OMNIPOTENT POWER AND MUST ULTIMATELY TRIUMPH OVER EVERY ASSAILING FORCE
AS A PRIEST OF GIVING UP DECEPTION
STRANGE AND CONTRADICTORY AS IT SEEMS ALL MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY HATE THE VERY SOCIAL ORDER THEY ARE THEMSELVES SUPPORTING
CHRIST'S TEACHING WHICH CAME TO BE KNOWN TO MEN NOT BY MEANS OF VIOLENCE AND THE SWORD THEY SAY BUT BY MEANS OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL GENTLENESS MEEKNESS AND PEACEABLENESS CAN ONLY BE DIFFUSED THROUGH THE WORLD BY THE EXAMPLE OF PEACE HARMONY AND LOVE AMONG ITS FOLLOWERS A CHRISTIAN ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF GOD HIMSELF CAN ACT ONLY PEACEABLY TOWARD ALL MEN AND THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO AUTHORITY ABLE TO FORCE THE CHRISTIAN TO ACT IN OPPOSITION TO THE TEACHING OF GOD AND TO THE PRINCIPAL VIRTUE OF THE CHRISTIAN IN HIS RELATION WITH HIS NEIGHBORS THE LAW OF STATE NECESSITY THEY SAY CAN FORCE ONLY THOSE TO CHANGE THE LAW OF GOD WHO FOR THE SAKE OF EARTHLY GAINS TRY TO RECONCILE THE IRRECONCILABLE
AND IF HE MADE OFF I OUGHT TO SHOOT HIM HE ADDED OBVIOUSLY PROUD OF KNOWING WHAT HE MUST DO IF HIS FATHER WERE ESCAPING
THEREFORE BY CHRIST'S TEACHING THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT WHETHER THE GOOD ARE TO BE FOUND AMONG RULERS OR RULED AND WHETHER THE WICKED ARE AMONG THE RULED OR THE RULERS
EVERY CONDITION ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE IS ONLY A PARTICULAR STEP IN THE ATTAINMENT OF INWARD AND OUTWARD PERFECTION AND THEREFORE HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE OF ITSELF
SO THAT AT LAST SUCH A DEPTH OF OBSCURITY HAS BEEN REACHED THAT MEN DO NOT TAKE IN THEIR DIRECT SENSE EVEN THE SIMPLEST PRECEPTS EXPRESSED IN THE SIMPLEST WORDS IN THE GOSPEL
ONE NEED ONLY GLANCE AT THIS SPECTACLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AT SUCH MOMENTS WHEN THEY ARE IN A STATE OF THE MOST COMPLETE INTOXICATION COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SOLDIERS AND INTERMEDIATE OFFICERS ALIKE WOULD BE CAPABLE OF COMMITTING CRIMES OF WHICH THEY WOULD NEVER DREAM UNDER OTHER CONDITIONS
TO HEAR AND TO READ THE SERMONS AND ARTICLES IN WHICH CHURCH WRITERS OF LATER TIMES OF ALL DENOMINATIONS SPEAK OF CHRISTIAN TRUTHS AND VIRTUES
AND INDEED THEY ARE A SERIOUS BUSINESS
A LITTLE KNOT OF SOME TWENTY MEN WERE COLLECTED TOGETHER ON THE PAVEMENT ENGAGED IN SERIOUS RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION
AT THE SAME TIME FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD UP MEN SEE THAT MURDER IS NOT ONLY PERMITTED BUT EVEN SANCTIONED BY THE BLESSING OF THOSE WHOM THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REGARD AS THEIR DIVINELY APPOINTED SPIRITUAL GUIDES AND SEE THEIR SECULAR LEADERS WITH CALM ASSURANCE ORGANIZING MURDER PROUD TO WEAR MURDEROUS ARMS AND DEMANDING OF OTHERS IN THE NAME OF THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY AND EVEN OF GOD THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE PART IN MURDER
NOW THAT WE HAVE OUTLIVED THAT PHASE OF THE LIFE OF HUMANITY WE UNDERSTAND THE RATIONAL GROUNDS FOR UNITING MEN IN FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND STATES
THE FALLACY OF THE ARGUMENT LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE ON WHICH LOVE FOR FAMILY AND NATION IS FOUNDED RESTS ITSELF ON LOVE OF SELF AND THAT LOVE GROWS WEAKER AND WEAKER AS IT IS EXTENDED FROM SELF TO FAMILY TRIBE NATIONALITY AND SLATE
IN THE SAME WAY ALL WHO TAKE PART IN SUCH AN AFFAIR FROM THE HIGHEST REPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITY WHO SIGNS HIS ASSENT TO THE REPORT FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT PRESIDING AT THE RECRUITING SESSIONS AND THE PRIEST WHO DELUDES THE RECRUITS TO THE LOWEST SOLDIER WHO IS READY NOW TO FIRE ON HIS OWN BROTHERS IMAGINE IN THE INTOXICATION OF POWER OR OF SERVILITY THAT THEY ARE SOME CONVENTIONAL CHARACTERS
SUCH A VIEW OF CHRIST AND HIS TEACHING FOLLOWS FROM MY BOOK
THE RICH ARE NOT AT EASE IN SPENDING THEIR WEALTH ONLY ON THEMSELVES AND LAVISH IT ON WORKS OF PUBLIC UTILITY
A REPORT OF THIS NEW OFFENSE WAS SENT TO THE TOWN
AND THAT IS JUST WHAT ALL HERESIES DO AND HAVE ALWAYS DONE
AND THE CONCLUSION WILL BE AS FINAL FOR THEM AS FOR THE YOUNG BIRDS HATCHED OUT OF THE EGGS
THE ONE LAW HE MAY NOT BREAK IS THAT OF FIDELITY AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE MAN WHO HAPPENS AT A GIVEN MOMENT TO BE IN POWER
THE FIRST QUESTION THE FIRST DOUBT OF A RUSSIAN WHO IS BEGINNING TO THINK IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE IKONS AND STILL MORE THE MIRACULOUS RELICS
HE WAS LED TO THE BENCH AND STRIPPED AND THEN ORDERED TO LIE DOWN
SOME PERSONS MAINTAIN THAT FREEDOM FROM VIOLENCE OR AT LEAST A GREAT DIMINUTION OF IT MAY BE GAINED BY THE OPPRESSED FORCIBLY OVERTURNING THE OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT AND REPLACING IT BY A NEW ONE UNDER WHICH SUCH VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION WILL BE UNNECESSARY BUT THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AND THEIR EFFORTS DO NOT BETTER THE POSITION OF THE OPPRESSED BUT ONLY MAKE IT WORSE
THE POLITICAL CONTRADICTION IS EVEN MORE STRIKING
THEN OF THE VIEWS OF THIS QUESTION MAINTAINED BY SPIRITUAL CRITICS THAT IS BY PROFESSED BELIEVERS IN THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND ALSO BY TEMPORAL ONES THAT IS THOSE WHO DO NOT PROFESS THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
THE FUTURE IS EVEN WORSE THAN THE OCEAN--THERE IS NOTHING THERE--IT WILL BE WHAT MEN AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT
WE WHO LOVE THINKERS PHILANTHROPISTS POETS AND SCIENTIFIC MEN OF FOREIGN ORIGIN AND ARE AS PROUD OF THE EXPLOITS OF FATHER DAMIEN AS IF HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES WE WHO HAVE A SIMPLE LOVE FOR MEN OF FOREIGN NATIONALITIES FRENCHMEN GERMANS AMERICANS AND ENGLISHMEN WHO RESPECT THEIR QUALITIES ARE GLAD TO MEET THEM AND MAKE THEM SO WARMLY WELCOME CANNOT REGARD WAR WITH THEM AS ANYTHING HEROIC
AND THAT VERY DOCTRINE OF RETRIBUTION WHICH CHRIST REJECTED AND IN PLACE OF WHICH HE PUT HIS TEACHING IS MORE PRACTICALLY USEFUL FOR US
TO THE TRIBE THE FAMILY THE CLAN THE NATION
IF BY THESE EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IS MEANT THE MEN WHO ARE PUNISHED AS CRIMINALS WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT THEY ARE NOT A DIFFERENT KIND OF BEING LIKE WILD BEASTS AMONG SHEEP BUT ARE MEN JUST LIKE OURSELVES AND NO MORE NATURALLY INCLINED TO CRIMES THAN THOSE AGAINST WHOM THEY COMMIT THEM
MOREOVER HE IS DIRECTING EVERY EFFORT TO MAINTAINING THIS STATE OF THINGS SO FLATLY OPPOSED TO ALL HIS BELIEFS
AND IT IS JUST AS UNPROFITABLE AND HARMFUL AND UNPLEASANT TO THEM TO BE FLOGGED AS TO ME AND THEREFORE THERE IS EVERY LIKELIHOOD THAT IF I OPEN THEIR EYES THEY NOT ONLY WOULD NOT TREAT ME WITH VIOLENCE BUT WOULD DO JUST AS I AM DOING
TO ADVOCATE THE REJECTION OF CHRIST'S COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL OR ITS ADAPTATION TO THE NEEDS OF LIFE IMPLIES A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE TEACHING OF CHRIST
DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS ADOPTED BY PEACE CONVENTION
CHRISTIANITY OR THE STATE?--THERE ARE SOME WHO ASSERT THE NECESSITY OF A STATE ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS WHO DENY IT BOTH ARGUING FROM SAME FIRST PRINCIPLES--NEITHER CONTENTION CAN BE PROVED BY ABSTRACT ARGUMENT--THE QUESTION MUST BE DECIDED BY THE STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSCIENCE OF EACH MAN WHICH WILL EITHER PREVENT OR ALLOW HIM TO SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION--RECOGNITION OF THE FUTILITY AND IMMORALITY OF SUPPORTING A STATE ORGANIZATION CONTRARY TO CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES WILL DECIDE THE QUESTION FOR EVERY MAN IN SPITE OF ANY ACTION ON PART OF THE STATE--ARGUMENT OF THOSE WHO DEFEND THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS A FORM OF SOCIAL LIFE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE GOOD FROM THE WICKED TILL ALL NATIONS AND ALL MEMBERS OF EACH NATION HAVE BECOME CHRISTIANS--THE MOST WICKED ARE ALWAYS THOSE IN POWER--THE WHOLE HISTORY OF HUMANITY IS THE HISTORY OF THE FORCIBLE APPROPRIATION OF POWER BY THE WICKED AND THEIR OPPRESSION OF THE GOOD--THE RECOGNITION BY GOVERNMENTS OF THE NECESSITY OF
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT NOT RELIGIOUS OR MORAL FEELING ALONE BUT THE SIMPLEST COMMON SENSE AND FORESIGHT SHOULD IMPEL EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY TO ANSWER AND TO ACT IN THAT WAY
MANY READERS MAY BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE OPENING CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK
HE THROWS ROUND HIM A KIND OF CURTAIN OF BROCADE PULLS HIS LONG HAIR OUT OVER IT OPENS THE VERY GOSPEL IN WHICH SWEARING IS FORBIDDEN TAKES THE CROSS THE VERY CROSS ON WHICH CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT DO WHAT THIS FALSE SERVANT OF HIS IS TELLING MEN TO DO AND PUTS THEM ON THE LECTERN
AND THIS ADMISSION HAS NOT OPENED PEOPLE'S EYES HAS NOT HORRIFIED THEM
MY BOOK WAS AS I HAD ANTICIPATED SUPPRESSED BY THE RUSSIAN CENSORSHIP
THEY ARE THE MEN WHOSE PRAISES ARE CELEBRATED IN POETRY WHO ARE HONORED BY SCULPTURE AND RECEIVED WITH TRIUMPHANT JUBILATIONS
THE GREATER OR LESS BLESSEDNESS OF A MAN DEPENDS ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE NOT ON THE DEGREE OF PERFECTION TO WHICH HE HAS ATTAINED BUT ON THE GREATER OR LESS SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH HE IS PURSUING IT
IT IS IN THIS SENSE THAT THE LOST SHEEP IS DEARER TO THE FATHER THAN THOSE THAT WERE NOT LOST
THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE WE HAVE SEEN CONSISTS IN THE TRANSFER OF THE AIM OF LIFE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO GROUPS AND THEIR MAINTENANCE--TO THE TRIBE FAMILY RACE OR STATE
OUGHT OR OUGHT NOT EACH MAN CALLED UPON FOR MILITARY SERVICE TO SUBMIT TO SERVE IN THE ARMY
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF PAGAN TIMES IS NOTHING BUT A RECITAL OF THE INCIDENTS AND MEANS BY WHICH THE MORE WICKED GAINED POSSESSION OF POWER OVER THE LESS WICKED AND RETAINED IT BY CRUELTIES AND DECEPTIONS RULING OVER THE GOOD UNDER THE PRETENSE OF GUARDING THE RIGHT AND PROTECTING THE GOOD FROM THE WICKED
IF IT WERE NOT FOR HYPOCRISY THEY COULD NOT GO ON LIVING SUCH A LIFE
CONTRADICTION BETWEEN OUR LIFE AND OUR CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE VI
AND IT DOES NOT STRIKE ANYONE THE GUARDS OR VASSILY NIKITIN WHOM THEY ARE BRINGING IN OR ANY OF THE SPECTATORS OF THIS SCENE--THAT THESE INARTICULATE WORDS OF THE YOUNG MAN AT ONCE SUPPRESSED BY THE AUTHORITIES CONTAIN THE TRUTH AND THAT THE LOUD SOLEMNLY UTTERED SENTENCES OF THE CALM SELF-CONFIDENT OFFICIAL AND THE PRIEST ARE A LIE AND A DECEPTION
AND SECONDLY FROM THE FACT THAT THOSE DEPRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS OR THREATS OF DEPRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS WHICH REDUCE THE MAN OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO THE NECESSITY OF OBEYING TO THE CHRISTIAN FROM HIS DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF LIFE PRESENT THEMSELVES MERELY AS THE INEVITABLE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE
IT IS A MARVELOUS BOOK FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
THE POSITIVISTS THE COMMUNISTS AND ALL THE APOSTLES OF FRATERNITY ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES ADVOCATE THE EXTENSION TO THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY OF THE LOVE MEN FEEL FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES AND THE STATE
THEY GAIN NO KIND OF ADVANTAGE AND CAN BE IN NO FEAR OF LOSING THE POSITION THEY OCCUPY BECAUSE IT IS WORSE THAN THAT FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN
BUT THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY TROOPS AND THE TORTURE DID NOT CEASE TILL IT HAD REACHED THE LIMIT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED BY THE CAPRICE OF THE MISERABLE HALF-DRUNKEN AND INSANE CREATURE THEY CALLED THE GOVERNOR
BUT SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU MATT
THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAS ALREADY ARISEN IN OUR SOCIETY AND WILL INFALLIBLY PUT AN END TO THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF OUR LIFE BASED ON FORCE--WHEN THAT WILL BE
EVEN THE MOST CRUEL BAND OF BRIGANDS IS NOT SO MUCH TO BE DREADED AS SUCH A GOVERNMENT
BUT RATHER FEAR HIM WHICH IS ABLE TO DESTROY BOTH SOUL AND BODY IN HELL."--MATT
WHAT IS THERE TO SHOW THAT CHRIST ENJOINED NON-RESISTANCE IN THAT SENSE
IT WOULD DOUBTLESS BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS IF MEN COULD LOVE HUMANITY JUST AS THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILY
THE MISCONCEPTION IS BASED PRECISELY ON THE FACT THAT THE TEACHING OF CHRIST GUIDES MEN DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE PRECEPTS FOUNDED ON THE LOWER CONCEPTION OF LIFE GUIDE MEN
WE RECOGNIZE THE USELESSNESS OF THE EXPENDITURE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE COURT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF GOVERNMENT AND WE REGARD THE TEACHING OF THE CHURCH AS INJURIOUS BUT WE ARE OBLIGED TO BEAR OUR SHARE OF THE EXPENSES OF THESE INSTITUTIONS
TAKE NO OATHS
XI
SECONDLY IT IS ILL FOUNDED BECAUSE EVEN IF TO USE FORCE AGAINST WICKED MEN HAD BEEN PERMITTED BY GOD SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A PERFECT AND UNFAILING DISTINCTION BY WHICH ONE COULD POSITIVELY KNOW THE WICKED FROM THE GOOD SO IT WOULD COME TO ALL INDIVIDUAL MEN AND SOCIETIES OF MEN MUTUALLY REGARDING EACH OTHER AS WICKED MEN AS IS THE CASE NOW
HISTORY BEARS WITNESS TO IT
THIS CHANGE IS BROUGHT ABOUT IN TWO WAYS
BESIDES GENERALLY SPEAKING WHERE NON-RESISTANCE COSTS THE SACRIFICE OF A SINGLE LIFE OR OF SOME MATERIAL WELFARE RESISTANCE COSTS A THOUSAND SUCH SACRIFICES
THAT IS JUST WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN ALL CASES OF VIOLENCE
THIS MISERABLE MAN IMBECILE AND DRUNK WITH POWER OUTRAGES IN THIS UTTERANCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE SACRED FOR A MAN OF THE MODERN WORLD
LOVE OF ONE'S OWN PEOPLE WHO ARE OF THE SAME BLOOD THE SAME TONGUE AND THE SAME RELIGION AS ONE'S SELF IS POSSIBLE THOUGH FAR FROM BEING SO STRONG AS LOVE OF SELF OR EVEN LOVE OF FAMILY OR CLAN
A RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO REV
THE INCONSISTENCY OF ALL CHURCH FORMS OF RELIGION WITH THE TEACHING OF CHRIST IS OF COURSE THE REASON WHY SPECIAL EFFORTS ARE NECESSARY TO CONCEAL THIS INCONSISTENCY FROM PEOPLE
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT
AND THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT RESTS ON THESE VERY OBLIGATIONS
NOW THEY MUST GO FORWARD AND ASSIMILATE THE NEXT AND HIGHER CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH IS WHAT IS NOW TAKING PLACE
THOSE WHO FIGHT TO EAT THE CONQUERED OR THOSE WHO FIGHT TO KILL FOR NOTHING BUT TO KILL
FOR THESE UNCHRISTIAN MEN WOULD ROB OUTRAGE AND KILL THE CHRISTIANS WITH IMPUNITY AND WOULD MAKE THEIR LIVES MISERABLE
CRITICISMS OF THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE ON THE PART OF BELIEVERS AND OF UNBELIEVERS
IT IS CAUSED BEYOND DISPUTE BY THE EXPENDITURE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF ARMAMENTS WHICH SWALLOWS UP A THIRD AND EVEN A HALF OF ALL THE EXPENDITURE OF EUROPEAN STATES
WHY DO ALL KINGS AND EMPERORS WEAR THE MILITARY UNIFORM
THEY STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP THE ORGANIZATION BASED ON THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE BUT DO NOT BELIEVE IN IT THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT IS EXTINCT AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE IN IT
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE OURSELVES THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN IN PRISON IN RUSSIA ALONE TO GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF OUR PROPERTY AND TRANQUILLITY AND THAT WE DO NOT KNOW OF THE LAW TRIBUNALS IN WHICH WE TAKE PART AND WHICH AT OUR INITIATIVE CONDEMN THOSE WHO HAVE ATTACKED OUR PROPERTY OR OUR SECURITY TO PRISON EXILE OR FORCED LABOR WHEREBY MEN NO WORSE THAN THOSE WHO CONDEMN THEM ARE RUINED AND CORRUPTED

BLESSEDNESS CONSISTS IN PROGRESS TOWARD PERFECTION
AND IT DELAYS EVERY TRUTH A LONG WHILE TILL IT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF PROLONGED STRUGGLES AND HAS THOROUGHLY PERMEATED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HUMANITY
THE SOLE GUIDE WHICH DIRECTS MEN AND NATIONS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND IS THE UNSEEN INTANGIBLE UNDERLYING FORCE THE RESULTANT OF ALL THE SPIRITUAL FORCES OF A CERTAIN PEOPLE OR OF ALL HUMANITY WHICH FINDS ITS OUTWARD EXPRESSION IN PUBLIC OPINION
WHY DO HISTORIANS NOVELISTS AND POETS WHO HAVE NO HOPE OF GAINING ANYTHING BY THEIR FLATTERIES MAKE HEROES OF KINGS EMPERORS AND CONQUERORS OF PAST TIMES
YET WE ARE ALL BOUND TO TAKE A HAND IN THIS SLAUGHTER WHICH IS BOUND TO COME TO PASS TO-MORROW NOT TO-DAY
ONE MIGHT AS WELL SUGGEST TO MERCHANTS AND BANKERS THAT THEY SHOULD SELL NOTHING FOR A GREATER PRICE THAN THEY GAVE FOR IT SHOULD UNDERTAKE THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOR NO PROFIT AND SHOULD ABOLISH MONEY AS IT WOULD THUS BE RENDERED UNNECESSARY
ALL THIS CONVINCED ME THAT WHILE ON ONE HAND THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DOCTRINE HAD NEVER BEEN LOST TO A MINORITY BUT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED MORE AND MORE CLEARLY ON THE OTHER HAND THE MEANING OF IT HAD BEEN MORE AND MORE OBSCURED FOR THE MAJORITY
FOR EVERY ONE THAT FORSAKES HOUSES OR BRETHREN OR SISTERS OR FATHER OR MOTHER OR WIFE OR CHILDREN OR LANDS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE SHALL RECEIVE A HUNDREDFOLD AND SHALL INHERIT EVERLASTING LIFE
THOSE WHO DO EVIL THROUGH IGNORANCE OF THE TRUTH PROVOKE SYMPATHY WITH THEIR VICTIMS AND REPUGNANCE FOR THEIR ACTIONS THEY DO HARM ONLY TO THOSE THEY ATTACK
IN OUR DAY GOVERNMENTS NOT ONLY FAIL TO ENCOURAGE BUT DIRECTLY HINDER EVERY MOVEMENT BY WHICH PEOPLE TRY TO WORK OUT NEW FORMS OF LIFE FOR THEMSELVES
THAT POWER DEMANDS OF US ONLY WHAT IS REASONABLE CERTAIN AND POSSIBLE
IF HE KILLS A FELLOW-CREATURE HE IS A MURDERER
THE PRECEPT SHOWING THE LEVEL BELOW WHICH WE CANNOT FALL IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS IDEAL IS THAT OF PURITY OF MARRIED LIFE AVOIDANCE OF DEBAUCHERY
BUT NO CONSIDERATIONS AS TO HOW FAR THE STATE IS USEFUL OR BENEFICIAL TO THE MEN WHO HELP TO SUPPORT IT BY SERVING IN THE ARMY NOR OF THE ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL OF COMPLIANCE OR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH STATE DEMANDS WILL DECIDE THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OR THE ABOLITION OF GOVERNMENT
TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE FROM TIMES NEARER OUR OWN WE MAY RECALL THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV
RENOUNCE NATIONAL DISTINCTIONS
BUT THE VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION WOULD BE UNCHANGED OR EVEN MORE CRUEL SINCE HATRED WOULD BE INTENSIFIED BY THE STRUGGLE AND NEW FORMS OF OPPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVISED
THESE MEN HAVE FOR THE MOST PART THROUGH THE INTOXICATION OF POWER SO LOST THE RIGHT IDEA OF WHAT THAT CHRISTIANITY IS IN THE NAME OF WHICH THEY HOLD THEIR POSITION THAT WHAT IS CHRISTIAN IN CHRISTIANITY PRESENTS ITSELF TO THEM AS HERESY WHILE EVERYTHING IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS WHICH CAN BE DISTORTED INTO AN ANTICHRISTIAN AND HEATHEN MEANING THEY REGARD AS THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY
THE WICKED WILL ALWAYS DOMINATE THE GOOD AND WILL ALWAYS OPPRESS THEM
E THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN PROFESSION AND PRACTICE AND I CONTINUE TO PROFESS RELIGION AND TAKE PART IN GOVERNMENT AND PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING AT THE SAME TIME A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN AND A DEVOTED SERVANT OF THE GOVERNMENT
PUBLIC OPINION EVER SINCE THE TIME OF MOSES HAS REGARDED COVETOUSNESS PROFLIGACY AND CRUELTY AS WRONG AND CENSURED THEM ACCORDINGLY
THE POSITION OF THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLES IN OUR DAYS HAS REMAINED JUST AS CRUEL AS IT WAS IN THE TIMES OF PAGANISM
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY IN THE GERMAN REICHSTAG NOT LONG AGO IN REPLY TO A QUESTION WHY FUNDS WERE NEEDED FOR RAISING THE SALARIES OF THE UNDER-OFFICERS THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR OPENLY DECLARED THAT TRUSTWORTHY UNDER-OFFICERS WERE NECESSARY TO CONTEND AGAINST SOCIALISM
BUT IF THIS IS SO IF IT IS TRUE THAT IT DEPENDS ON US TO BREAK DOWN THE EXISTING ORGANIZATION OF LIFE HAVE WE THE RIGHT TO DESTROY IT WITHOUT KNOWING CLEARLY WHAT WE SHALL SET UP IN ITS PLACE
AS FOR THE EFFORTS TO ABOLISH WAR THEY CALL FOR NOTHING BUT A SMILE
ALL THAT IS UNJUST THEY SAY
I WAS FINISHING THIS BOOK WHICH I HAD BEEN WORKING AT FOR TWO YEARS WHEN I HAPPENED ON THE 9TH OF SEPTEMBER TO BE TRAVELING BY RAIL THROUGH THE GOVERNMENTS OF TOULA AND RIAZAN WHERE THE PEASANTS WERE STARVING LAST YEAR AND WHERE THE FAMINE IS EVEN MORE SEVERE NOW
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST IT WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO VIOLENCE OF SOME KIND
FIRST I WILL SPEAK OF THE INFORMATION I RECEIVED ON THE HISTORY OF THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL
THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAS ALREADY ARISEN IN OUR SOCIETY AND WILL INFALLIBLY PUT AN END TO THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF OUR LIFE BASED ON FORCE--WHEN THAT WILL BE XII
THE MOST CULTIVATED AND REFINED PEOPLE OF OUR SOCIETY ARE NOT NOWADAYS TO BE FOUND AMONG THE VERY RICH AS USED FORMERLY TO BE THE RULE
IF CERTAIN PERSONS APPROPRIATE THE RIGHT OF CHOOSING THE FORM OF THE EDUCATION RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR OF CHILDREN AND CERTAIN PERSONS MONOPOLIZE THE RIGHT OF MAKING THE LAWS ALL MUST OBEY AND SO DISPOSE OF THE LIVES AND PROPERTIES OF OTHER PEOPLE--ALL THIS IS NOT DONE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WISH IT AND BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IS NATURAL AND RIGHT BUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT AND RULING CLASSES WISH THIS TO BE SO FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT AND INSIST ON ITS BEING SO EVEN BY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ALL MEN OF OUR DAY IN THEIR INNER CONSCIOUSNESS CONDEMN THE EXISTING EFFETE PAGAN ORDER AND ADMIT OFTEN UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHILE REGARDING THEMSELVES AS HOSTILE TO CHRISTIANITY THAT OUR SALVATION IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN THE APPLICATION OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OR PARTS OF IT IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE TO OUR DAILY LIFE
IF THEN THE TIME IS PREDICTED WHEN SWORDS SHALL BE BEATEN INTO PLOWSHARES AND SPEARS INTO PRUNING HOOKS AND MEN SHALL NOT LEARN THE ART OF WAR ANY MORE IT FOLLOWS THAT ALL WHO MANUFACTURE SELL OR WIELD THESE DEADLY WEAPONS DO THUS ARRAY THEMSELVES AGAINST THE PEACEFUL DOMINION OF THE SON OF GOD ON EARTH
THERE IS NO LINE OTHER THAN THAT LAID DOWN BY CHRISTIANITY AND THAT LINE IS BOTH REASONABLE AND PRACTICABLE
NO ONE IS SURPRISED THAT TOGETHER WITH ITS RECOGNITION OF LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY LIBERAL SCIENCE SHOULD PROVE THE NECESSITY OF WAR PUNISHMENT CUSTOMS THE CENSURE THE REGULATION OF PROSTITUTION THE EXCLUSION OF CHEAP FOREIGN LABORERS THE HINDRANCE OF EMIGRATION THE JUSTIFIABLENESS OF COLONIZATION BASED ON POISONING AND DESTROYING WHOLE RACES OF MEN CALLED SAVAGES AND SO ON
IT PROCEEDS FIRST AND PRINCIPALLY FROM THE FACT THAT ALL MEN IN GENERAL ARE ADVANCING STEADILY AND UNDEVIATINGLY TOWARD A MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS ASSIMILATION OF THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE
THAT IS THE ACCEPTED METHOD FOR DECIDING DISPUTES AMONG CHRISTIAN NATIONS
NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON WAS CHRIST'S ONLY HARSH AND THREATENING REPROOF DIRECTED AGAINST HYPOCRITES AND HYPOCRISY
THE PECULIARITY OF A SLAVE IS THAT HE IS A MERE TOOL IN THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER A THING NOT A MAN
TO SAVE APPEARANCES THOUGH THEY SHUT THE YOUNG MAN UP IN PRISON AND WRITE TO THE HIGHEST MILITARY AUTHORITIES TO INQUIRE WHAT THEY ARE TO DO
THE ONE LAW WAS NOT OPPOSED TO THE OTHER
THAT IS THE NATURE OF ALL RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THIS COUNTRY
TO BRING THESE PEOPLE UNDER THE SWAY OF CHRISTIANITY THERE IS ONE ONLY MEANS THAT IS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIAL IDEAL WHICH CAN ONLY BE REALIZED AMONG THEM BY TRUE CHRISTIAN TEACHING AND SUPPORTED BY A TRUE EXAMPLE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE
PEOPLE LIVING IN NATURAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE NOT IN TOWNS BUT IN THE MIDST OF NATURE AND CARRYING ON THE STRUGGLE WITH NATURE LIVE WITHOUT THIS PROTECTION AND KNOW HOW LITTLE FORCE CAN PROTECT US FROM THE REAL DANGERS WITH WHICH WE ARE SURROUNDED
THE CIVILIZED PAGAN RECOGNIZES LIFE NOT IN HIMSELF ALONE BUT IN SOCIETIES OF MEN--IN THE TRIBE THE CLAN THE FAMILY THE KINGDOM AND SACRIFICES HIS PERSONAL GOOD FOR THESE SOCIETIES
HERE IS WHAT THE CELEBRATED ACADEMICIAN CAMILLE DOUCET WRITES IN REPLY TO THE EDITOR OF THE REVUE DES REVUES WHERE SEVERAL LETTERS ON WAR WERE PUBLISHED TOGETHER
THE INWARD CONDITION OF MEN IN THE TIMES OF HEATHENISM WAS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR INWARD CONDITION AT THE PRESENT TIME
HE HAS NO PRINCIPLE FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH HE COULD RESIST VIOLENCE ALONE
NOAH MOSES AND THE PROPHETS TAUGHT THAT HE WHO KILLS MAIMS OR INJURES HIS NEIGHBORS DOES EVIL
2 THAT NEW TREATIES IN HARMONY WITH THE WISHES OF THE POPULATIONS CONCERNED BE CONCLUDED FOR ESTABLISHING THE NEUTRALIZATION OF OTHER STATES
THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAS LED MEN BY A NATURAL TRANSITION FROM LOVE OF SELF AND THEN OF FAMILY TRIBE NATION AND STATE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE NECESSITY OF LOVE FOR HUMANITY A CONCEPTION WHICH HAS NO DEFINITE LIMITS AND EXTENDS TO ALL LIVING THINGS
BUT IT IS UNTRUE THAT THE RUSSIAN CHURCH IN ITS INFLUENCE ON THE PEOPLE IS IN ANY RESPECT DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER CHURCH
I KNOW--AS WE ALL DO--VERY LITTLE OF THE PRACTICE AND THE SPOKEN AND WRITTEN DOCTRINE OF FORMER TIMES ON THE SUBJECT OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL
WHAT ARE GOVERNMENTS TO DO AGAINST SUCH PEOPLE
THEN IT IS SUGGESTED TO THE PARENTS AND EVEN EXACTED OF THEM UNDER FEAR OF PUNISHMENT FOR NON-FULFILLMENT THAT THE CHILD MUST BE BAPTIZED
IN THE SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT IT IS MAINTAINED THAT THE GREATER THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY OUGHT TO INTERVENE IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF PRIVATE LIFE IN WHICH IT HAS NOT YET INTERVENED THE BETTER IT WILL BE AND THAT THEREFORE WE OUGHT TO INVOKE THE INTERFERENCE OF GOVERNMENT IN PRIVATE LIFE
BUT BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE STATE THERE WERE ALWAYS MEN TO BE FOUND WHO DID NOT ACCEPT AS BINDING ON THEMSELVES THE LAWS GIVEN OUT AS THE DECREES OF A GOD OR MADE BY MEN INVESTED WITH A SACRED CHARACTER OR THE INSTITUTIONS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE NATION
I SHOULD WISH THAT WAR COULD BE PUT OFF FOR THE LONGEST POSSIBLE TIME
THEN WHY DID THEY DO IT OR ALLOW IT TO BE DONE
IN SPITE OF THE NUMBER OF TCHERKESSES EXECUTED FOR ROBBERY THEY CONTINUE TO BE ROBBERS FROM THEIR YOUTH UP FOR NO MAIDEN WILL MARRY A TCHERKESS YOUTH TILL HE HAS GIVEN PROOF OF HIS BRAVERY BY CARRYING OFF A HORSE OR AT LEAST A SHEEP
IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HAVE ALL PASSED THROUGH THAT TERRIBLE SKILLFUL EDUCATION ELABORATED THROUGH CENTURIES WHICH KILLS ALL INITIATIVE IN A MAN AND THAT THEY ARE SO TRAINED TO MECHANICAL OBEDIENCE THAT AT THE WORD OF COMMAND
BUT NO HONEST AND SERIOUS-MINDED MAN OF OUR DAY CAN HELP SEEING THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY--THE DOCTRINE OF MEEKNESS FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES AND LOVE--WITH GOVERNMENT WITH ITS POMP ACTS OF VIOLENCE EXECUTIONS AND WARS
THE CONGRESS IN VIEW OF THE VAST SOCIAL AND MORAL INFLUENCE OF WOMAN URGES UPON EVERY WOMAN TO SUSTAIN THE THINGS THAT MAKE FOR PEACE AS OTHERWISE SHE INCURS GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SYSTEMS OF MILITARISM
THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION LIES IN THE FACULTY OF MEN OF FORESEEING AND POINTING OUT THE PATH OF LIFE ALONG WHICH HUMANITY MUST MOVE IN THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW THEORY OF LIFE AS A RESULT OF WHICH THE WHOLE FUTURE CONDUCT OF HUMANITY IS CHANGED AND DIFFERENT FROM ALL THAT HAS BEEN BEFORE
WAS IT THE INVASIONS OF THE PERSIANS WHICH SAVED GREECE FROM FALLING INTO THE MOST HIDEOUS MATERIALISM
E IN THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH AND OF HERESY THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE SINCERE AND CONSCIENTIOUS MAN OF ANY IMPORTANCE WHOM THE CHURCHMEN WOULD NOT FROM ENVY OR OTHER CAUSES HAVE RUINED THUS ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE REAL MEANING OF HERESY WAS UNDERSTOOD
NOT TO EAT BUTTER OR MILK ON CERTAIN DAYS AND ON CERTAIN OTHER DAYS TO SING TE DEUMS AND REQUIEMS FOR THE DEAD ON HOLIDAYS TO ENTERTAIN THE PRIEST AND GIVE HIM MONEY AND SEVERAL TIMES IN THE YEAR TO BRING THE IKONS FROM THE CHURCH AND TO CARRY THEM SLUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS THROUGH THE FIELDS AND HOUSES
ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT EVERY MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WHO HAS A GRAIN OF SENSE LEFT MIGHT REPLY TO SUCH REQUIREMENTS BUT WHY SHOULD I DO ALL THIS ONE WOULD THINK EVERY RIGHT-MINDED MAN MUST SAY IN AMAZEMENT
TOLSTOI DISDAINS ALL ATTEMPT TO CAPTIVATE THE READER
THEY ARE ROBBED OF THEIR TIME NOW BY COMPULSORY SERVICE THAT THEY MAY BE ROBBED OF THEIR LIVES LATER
IF EVER ANY OF THE NATIONS CONQUERED BY FORCE HAVE BEEN REALLY SUBJUGATED OR EVEN NEARLY SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN BY THE ACTION OF PUBLIC OPINION AND NEVER BY VIOLENCE WHICH ONLY TENDS TO DRIVE A PEOPLE TO FURTHER REBELLION

THE BEST OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE AGE WHEN THEY ARE STILL UNCORRUPTED BY LIFE AND ARE CHOOSING A CAREER PREFER THE CALLING OF DOCTOR ENGINEER TEACHER ARTIST WRITER OR EVEN THAT OF SIMPLE FARMER LIVING ON HIS OWN LABOR TO LEGAL ADMINISTRATIVE CLERICAL AND MILITARY POSITIONS IN THE PAY OF GOVERNMENT OR TO AN IDLE EXISTENCE LIVING ON THEIR INCOMES
CAN A CHRISTIAN GIVE A VOTE AT ELECTIONS OR TAKE PART IN GOVERNMENT OR LAW BUSINESS
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL WHEN A MAN DID NOT SEE MEN OF ANY OTHER FORM OF RELIGION THAN HIS OWN
TO CONVINCE ONESELF OF THIS ONE NEED ONLY REMEMBER WHAT THINGS ARE DONE IN EVERY STATE IN THE NAME OF ORDER AND THE PUBLIC WELFARE OF WHICH THE EXECUTION ALWAYS FALLS TO THE ARMY
BUT THE TIME WILL COME AND IS COMING WHEN IT WILL BE PERFECTLY EVIDENT TO EVERYONE THAT THEY ARE NOT OF ANY USE AT ALL AND ONLY A HINDRANCE AND THOSE WHOM THEY INTERFERE WITH WILL SAY GENTLY AND QUIETLY TO THEM LIKE MY FRIEND IN THE STREET MEETING PRAY DON'T INTERFERE WITH US AND ALL THE MESSENGERS AND THOSE WHO SEND THEM TOO WILL BE OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THIS GOOD ADVICE THAT IS TO SAY WILL LEAVE OFF GALLOPING ABOUT WITH THEIR ARMS AKIMBO INTERFERING WITH PEOPLE AND GETTING OFF THEIR HORSES AND REMOVING THEIR SPURS WILL LISTEN TO WHAT IS BEING SAID AND MIXING WITH OTHERS WILL TAKE THEIR PLACE WITH THEM IN SOME REAL HUMAN WORK
DON'T SPEAK OF THAT
THAT THERE IS GREAT SECURITY IN BEING GENTLE LONG-SUFFERING AND ABUNDANT IN MERCY
WE MAY CONSIDER THE ANSWER GIVEN BY CHRIST UNSATISFACTORY
BUT MEN WERE NOT READY TO ACCEPT THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY CHRIST AND THE OLD DEFINITIONS OF EVIL WHICH OUGHT TO BE RESISTED CONTINUED TO BE LAID DOWN BY MEANS OF MAKING LAWS BINDING ON ALL AND ENFORCED BY FORCIBLE MEANS
AS THE DISPOSITION OF INDIVIDUALS TO VIOLENCE DIMINISHED AND AS THE HABITS OF THE PEOPLE BECAME MORE CIVILIZED AND AS POWER GREW MORE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION DEMORALIZED THROUGH LACK OF RESTRAINT THIS ADVANTAGE DISAPPEARED
WITH GOOD REASON VOLTAIRE CALLS THE CHURCH L'INFAME
INSIDE THE OFFICE THE WORK WAS GOING ON RAPIDLY
HE MUST GO ON AND HE CANNOT SAY
ALL THESE PRECEPTS ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT ON OUR JOURNEY TO PERFECTION WE ARE ALREADY FULLY ABLE TO AVOID AND WHAT WE MUST LABOR TO ATTAIN NOW AND WHAT WE OUGHT BY DEGREES TO TRANSLATE INTO INSTINCTIVE AND UNCONSCIOUS HABITS
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR THE MAN OF ANCIENT TIMES TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY BASED ON THE DIVISION OF MANKIND INTO MASTERS AND SLAVES BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT SUCH A DISTINCTION WAS DECREED BY GOD AND MUST ALWAYS EXIST
THAT IS WHY THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE SO LITTLE OPPRESSION OF THE WORKING CLASSES AND NO COUNTRY WHERE THE END OF THE ABUSES OF GOVERNMENT AND OF GOVERNMENT ITSELF SEEMS SO NEAR
THEY MAY SLAUGHTER THEM BY THOUSANDS BY MILLIONS THEY MAY TEAR THEM TO PIECES STILL THEY WILL MARCH TO WAR LIKE SENSELESS CATTLE
AS THE MEANS OF EXTERMINATION ARE IMPROVED THE MEANS OF REDUCING MEN WHO HOLD THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE TO SUBMISSION CAN BE IMPROVED TO CORRESPOND
WHILE THE SOLDIERS REFUSE TO FIRE ON THEIR FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN
WHILE CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NOT ONLY A DOCTRINE WHICH GIVES RULES WHICH A MAN MUST FOLLOW IT UNFOLDS A NEW MEANING IN LIFE AND DEFINES A WHOLE WORLD OF HUMAN ACTIVITY QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THAT HAS PRECEDED IT AND APPROPRIATE TO THE PERIOD ON WHICH MAN IS ENTERING
I DO NOT THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY GOOD WAY OF CARRYING OUT THE PRECEPTS OF RELIGION
SUCH FREE DISCUSSION I ONLY EXPECTED FROM WORLDLY FREETHINKING CRITICS WHO ARE NOT BOUND TO CHRIST'S TEACHING IN ANY WAY AND CAN THEREFORE TAKE AN INDEPENDENT VIEW OF IT
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS BUT I LIVE ON THE SALARY I GAIN BY COLLECTING TAXES FROM NEEDY LABORERS TO BE SPENT ON THE LUXURIES OF THE RICH AND IDLE
BEFORE THIS CHRISTIANIZING PROCESS COULD SO AFFECT ALL MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER THAT THEY WOULD PASS FROM THE HEATHEN TO THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND WOULD VOLUNTARILY ABANDON POWER AND WEALTH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT ALL THE COARSE HALF-SAVAGE MEN COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF APPRECIATING CHRISTIANITY OR ACTING UPON IT OF WHOM THERE ARE ALWAYS A GREAT MANY IN EVERY CHRISTIAN SOCIETY SHOULD BE CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY
AND THIS HAS BEEN SO INDEPENDENTLY OF THE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH NATIONS HAVE LIVED
ATTITUDE OF MEN OF SCIENCE TO RELIGIONS IN GENERAL--WHAT RELIGION IS AND WHAT IS ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE LIFE OF HUMANITY--THREE CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE--CHRISTIAN RELIGION THE EXPRESSION OF THE DIVINE CONCEPTION OF LIFE--MISINTERPRETATION OF CHRISTIANITY BY MEN OF SCIENCE WHO STUDY IT IN ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS DUE TO THEIR CRITICISING IT FROM STANDPOINT OF SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE--OPINION RESULTING FROM THIS MISINTERPRETATION THAT CHRIST'S MORAL TEACHING IS EXAGGERATED AND CANNOT BE PUT INTO PRACTICE--EXPRESSION OF DIVINE CONCEPTION OF LIFE IN THE GOSPEL--FALSE IDEAS OF MEN OF SCIENCE ON CHRISTIANITY PROCEED FROM THEIR CONVICTION THAT THEY HAVE AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF CRITICISM--FROM WHICH COME TWO MISCONCEPTIONS IN REGARD TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE--FIRST MISCONCEPTION THAT THE TEACHING CANNOT BE PUT INTO PRACTICE DUE TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION DIRECTING LIFE IN A WAY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SOCIAL THEORY OF LIFE--CHRISTIANITY HOLDS UP IDEAL DOES NOT LAY DOWN RULES--TO THE
A VERY GREAT DEAL WAS SAID IN CONNECTION WITH MY BOOK OF MY HAVING INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED THIS AND OTHER PASSAGES OF THE GOSPEL OF MY BEING IN ERROR IN NOT RECOGNIZING THE TRINITY THE REDEMPTION AND THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
AND WE HAVE NOW IN OUR CENTURY WITH OUR CIVILIZATION WITH THE SPREAD OF SCIENCE AND THE DEGREE OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH THE GENIUS OF MAN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ATTAINED SCHOOLS FOR TRAINING TO KILL TO KILL VERY FAR OFF TO PERFECTION GREAT NUMBERS AT ONCE TO KILL POOR DEVILS OF INNOCENT MEN WITH FAMILIES AND WITHOUT ANY KIND OF TRIAL
BUT THE LEARNED GENTLEMEN ARE UNWILLING TO SEE THAT AND KEEP HOPING TO FIND A POLITICAL COMBINATION THROUGH WHICH GOVERNMENTS SHALL BE INDUCED TO LIMIT THEIR POWERS THEMSELVES
E THAT ALTHOUGH ON THE ONE SIDE ONE CANNOT ABSOLUTELY DENY YET ON THE OTHER SIDE ONE CANNOT MAIN FULLY ASSENT ALL THE MORE SEEING THAT ETC ETC NO
FOR HE PIOUSLY BELIEVED THAT HIS PEOPLE WAS THE ONLY TRUE FINE AND GOOD PEOPLE DEAR TO GOD AND ALL THE REST WERE PHILISTINES BARBARIANS
IN SPITE OF THE PRETENDED EFFORTS OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TO AMELIORATE THE POSITION OF THE WORKERS ALL THE WORKING CLASSES OF THE PRESENT DAY ARE KEPT DOWN BY THE INFLEXIBLE IRON LAW BY WHICH THEY ONLY GET JUST WHAT IS BARELY NECESSARY SO THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT CEASING WHILE STILL RETAINING STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LABOR FOR THEIR EMPLOYERS WHO ARE REALLY THOSE WHO HAVE CONQUERED AND ENSLAVED THEM
AND THEY ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IF THEY TAKE THE PRINCIPLE OF PERFECTION GIVEN BY CHRIST'S TEACHING AS A RULE WHICH EVERYONE IS BOUND TO FULFILL JUST AS IN THE STATE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE EVERYONE IS BOUND TO CARRY OUT THE RULE OF PAYING TAXES SUPPORTING THE LAW AND SO ON
I HAVE OFTEN BEEN IRRITATED THOUGH IT WOULD BE COMIC IF THE CONSEQUENCES WERE NOT SO AWFUL BY OBSERVING HOW MEN SHUT ONE ANOTHER IN A DELUSION AND CANNOT GET OUT OF THIS MAGIC CIRCLE
AND WHEN ALL THIS HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY EVIDENT TO EVERYONE IT WILL BE NATURAL FOR MEN TO ASK THEMSELVES
THE CONGRESS AFFIRMS ITS BELIEF THAT THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN INVOLVES AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE A BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS
AND HE KNOWS THAT THERE IS A PRESS IF NOT IN RUSSIA AT LEAST ABROAD WHICH MAY REPORT THE AFFAIR AND COVER HIM WITH IGNOMINY FOREVER
THUS A GAMBLER OR A DRUNKARD WHO DOES NOT RESIST TEMPTATION AND YIELDS TO HIS PASSION IS STILL FREE TO RECOGNIZE GAMBLING AND DRUNKENNESS AS WRONG OR TO REGARD THEM AS A HARMLESS PASTIME
WHETHER THIS IS A GREAT OR SMALL DEGREE OF FREEDOM IN COMPARISON WITH THE FANTASTIC LIBERTY WE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IS THE ONLY FREEDOM THAT REALLY EXISTS AND IN IT CONSISTS THE ONLY HAPPINESS ATTAINABLE BY MAN
THEIR TEACHERS ARE FELLOWS LIKE THEMSELVES ONLY DECEIVED AND BRUTALIZED TWO OR THREE YEARS SOONER
THEN HE ACCEPTED THE SOCIAL STATE THEORY OF LIFE AND SUBMITTED TO IT
THE CHURCH AUTHORITIES ACCEPT THE TEACHING OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT ON NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE AS DIVINE REVELATION
THE GOVERNMENTS OF OUR DAY--ALL OF THEM THE MOST DESPOTIC AND THE LIBERAL ALIKE--HAVE BECOME WHAT HERZEN SO WELL CALLED GHENGHIS KHAN WITH THE TELEGRAPH THAT IS TO SAY ORGANIZATIONS OF VIOLENCE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE BUT THE GROSSEST TYRANNY AND AT THE SAME TIME TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE MEANS INVENTED BY SCIENCE FOR THE PEACEFUL COLLECTIVE SOCIAL ACTIVITY OF FREE AND EQUAL MEN USED BY THEM TO ENSLAVE AND OPPRESS THEIR FELLOWS
AND BY THIS EXPERIMENTAL EXTERNAL METHOD THE MAJORITY OF CHRISTIAN MEN HAVE NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS NECESSITY OF ASSIMILATING THE DOCTRINE
BUT YE SEEK TO KILL ME A MAN THAT HATH TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
THE NEXT DAY AFTER SEEING THE ATROCITIES PERPETRATED ON THE OTHER PEASANTS HE ENTREATED THE COMMANDER OF HIS COMPANY TO TEAR UP HIS COMPLAINT AND LET OFF THE TWO PEASANTS
THERE WAS RECENTLY HELD AT PETERSBURG AN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE HANDCUFFS MODELS OF SOLITARY CELLS THAT IS TO SAY INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE WORSE THAN KNOUTS OR RODS AND SENSITIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WENT AND AMUSED THEMSELVES BY LOOKING AT THEM
THERE SEEMS NO WAY OUT OF THE POSITION
THUS SOME ARE PERSUADED THAT THEY ARE NOT SIMPLE PEOPLE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT SPECIAL PEOPLE WHO ARE TO BE SPECIALLY HONORED
BUT IF ONE SMITES THEE ON THE RIGHT CHEEK TURN HIM THE OTHER ALSO
THAT STILL GREATER DISASTERS WOULD ENSUE IF THIS ORGANIZATION WERE DESTROYED
THE POLICE OFFICIAL IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS SUPERIOR WENT TO THE VILLAGE AND WITH THE INSOLENCE PECULIAR TO RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ORDERED HIS POLICEMEN TO TAKE ONE WOMAN OUT OF EACH HOUSE
AND AT LAST THEY CEASE TO APPOINT THEM AS CONSTABLES
IN RUSSIA AGAINST THE SO-CALLED NIHILISTS IN AMERICA AGAINST ANARCHISTS IN FRANCE AGAINST IMPERIALISTS LEGITIMISTS COMMUNARDS AND ANARCHISTS
THE LIFE OF HUMANITY CHANGES AND ADVANCES LIKE THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL BY STAGES AND EVERY STAGE HAS A THEORY OF LIFE APPROPRIATE TO IT WHICH IS INEVITABLY ABSORBED BY MEN
SO THAT THE EFFECT OF USING FORCE IS TO DISTURB AND TO WEAKEN THE VERY THING IT TRIES TO MAINTAIN
CHRIST RECOGNIZES THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH SIDES OF THE PARALLELOGRAM OF BOTH ETERNAL INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCES OF WHICH THE LIFE OF MAN IS COMPOUNDED
BUT REMEMBERING THE EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES THEY ALL DECLARE THEY SEE THEM AND ARE LOUD IN THEIR ADMIRATION
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE LIBERTY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH ABOUT GIVING OR NOT GIVING FREEDOM TO CHRISTIANS
BUT WE ONLY FANCY THIS BECAUSE THAT FIRST TRANSITION HAS BEEN SO FULLY COMPLETED THAT THE PRACTICE ATTAINED BY IT HAS BECOME UNCONSCIOUS AND INSTINCTIVE IN US WHILE THE PRESENT TRANSITION IS NOT YET OVER AND WE HAVE TO COMPLETE IT CONSCIOUSLY
CONSEQUENTLY OTHERS ARE ABLE TO SEIZE THEIR PLACE AND THE SAME PROCESS OF SOFTENING AND SO TO SAY UNCONSCIOUS CHRISTIANIZING GOES ON WITH THEM
EVEN THE STRONGEST CURRENT OF WATER CANNOT ADD A DROP TO A CUP WHICH IS ALREADY FULL
ON THE ESPLANADE DES INVALIDES AMONG THE EXOTIC AND COLONIAL ENCAMPMENTS A BUILDING IN A MORE SEVERE STYLE OVERAWES THE PICTURESQUE BAZAAR
WHILE IF I AM UNLUCKY I MAY BE CONDEMNED TO EXILE OR IMPRISONMENT FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS I JUDGE BY THE CASES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN RUSSIA POSSIBLY TO EVEN LONGER IMPRISONMENT OR POSSIBLY TO DEATH THOUGH THE PROBABILITY OF THAT LATTER IS VERY REMOTE
BUT MOST STRIKING OF ALL IS THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN LAW OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF MEN EXISTING IN THE CONSCIENCE AND THE NECESSITY UNDER WHICH ALL MEN ARE PLACED BY COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE OF BEING PREPARED FOR HATRED AND MURDER--OF BEING AT THE SAME TIME A CHRISTIAN AND A GLADIATOR
AND AFTER THAT HE MUST EAT WITH A LITTLE SPOON A MORSEL OF BREAD WITH WINE WHICH WILL PURIFY HIM STILL MORE
L'EGLISE EST LA SOCIETE DES FIDELES ETABLIE PAR NOTRE SEIGNEUR JESUS CHRIST REPANDUE SUR TOUTE LA TERRE ET SOUMISE A L'AUTHORITE DES PASTEURS LEGITIMES PRINCIPALEMENT NOTRE SAINT PERE LE PAPE SEE FOOTNOTE UNDERSTANDING BY THE WORDS PASTEURS LEGITIMES AN ASSOCIATION OF MEN HAVING THE POPE AT ITS HEAD AND CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BOUND TOGETHER BY A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE REACHED THEIR PRESENT NUMBER OF MILLIONS NOT ONLY THROUGH THE MENACE OF DANGER FROM NEIGHBORING STATES BUT PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE NECESSITY OF SUBDUING EVERY EFFORT AT REVOLT ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECTS
BUT THE CHURCH DOCTRINE ASSERTED ITS OWN COMPLETE AND FINAL COMPREHENSION AND REALIZATION OF IT
WAR IS HELD IN MORE VENERATION THAN EVER
SO IT WAS WITH THE PHARISEES SO IT IS NOW WITH CHURCH CHRISTIANS
IN THEIR DREAD OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH WILL DESTROY THE SOCIAL ORDER WHICH SOME CLING TO ONLY FROM HABIT OTHERS ALSO FROM INTEREST MEN CANNOT BUT BE THROWN BACK UPON THE PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE AND THE PRINCIPLES BASED ON IT
IF THE SAME UNANIMITY WHICH IS REVEALED IN ESSENTIAL POINTS OF BELIEF IS FOUND ALSO IN REJECTING CERTAIN TENDENCIES ARE WE NOT JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT THESE TENDENCIES WERE IN FLAGRANT OPPOSITION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY
ONE CANNOT OF COURSE ANTICIPATE THAT ENGLISH PEOPLE SLOW AS THEY ARE TO BE INFLUENCED BY IDEAS AND INSTINCTIVELY DISTRUSTFUL OF ALL THAT IS LOGICAL WILL TAKE A LEAP IN THE DARK AND ATTEMPT TO PUT TOLSTOI'S THEORY OF LIFE INTO PRACTICE
THUS THEY FLOGGED EACH OF THEM UP TO THE TWELFTH AND EACH OF THEM RECEIVED SEVENTY STROKES
WHEN THE TRUTH HAS BECOME SUFFICIENTLY WIDELY DIFFUSED MEN AT A LOWER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT ACCEPT IT ALL AT ONCE SIMPLY THROUGH CONFIDENCE IN THOSE WHO HAVE REACHED IT BY THE INNER SPIRITUAL WAY AND ARE APPLYING IT TO LIFE
THE GOVERNOR DELIVERS AN ADDRESS IN WHICH HE DEMANDS SUBMISSION
OTHERS--THE CHAMPIONS OF COMPLETE FREE WILL--KEEP THEIR EYES FIXED ON THEIR HYPOTHETICAL FREE WILL AND NEGLECT THIS WHICH SEEMED TO THEM SUCH A TRIVIAL DEGREE OF FREEDOM
HE SOMEHOW GETS INTO HIS TROUSERS WRAPS HIS FEET IN RAGS PUTS ON HIS BOOTS LOOKS FOR HIS SCARF AND CAP AND BUNDLES HIS PELISSE UNDER HIS ARM
BUT WHEN YOU KNOW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT YOU MAY DISAPPEAR ANY MINUTE WITHOUT THE LEAST POSSIBILITY EITHER FOR YOURSELF OR THOSE YOU DRAW AFTER YOU INTO YOUR ERROR OF RETRIEVING THE MISTAKE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY DO IN THE EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF LIFE IT WILL ALL DISAPPEAR AS QUICKLY AND SURELY AS YOU WILL YOURSELF AND WILL LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE NO REASONABLE GROUND FOR RUNNING THE RISK OF SUCH A FEARFUL MISTAKE
A WARLIKE NATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG AND FLOURISHING
SO IT HAS BEEN WITH ABOLITION OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT OF TRIAL BY TORTURE AND OF SLAVERY AS WELL AS WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS AND THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC MEETING
I SAY THAT WAR IS NECESSARY AND BENEFICIAL SINCE IT SEEMS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE FOR HUMANITY
THERE ARE NO IDEALS OTHER THAN THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS WHICH ARE ACCEPTED BY ALL AND REGARDED AS BINDING ON ALL
THAT EVIL CAN BE EXTERMINATED ONLY BY GOOD
THAT THE GREATER THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE WORKMAN THE NEARER THE DAY OF EMANCIPATION AND THEREFORE EVERY PERSONAL EFFORT ON THE PART OF A MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE OPPRESSION OF CAPITAL IS USELESS
AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS NOT ONLY THE LIKELIHOOD BUT THE CERTAINTY THAT THE OLD HOUSE WILL FALL DOWN AND CRUSH THOSE WHO REMAIN WITHIN IT
IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE SOURCE OF THE EVIL IS THE GOVERNMENT
IV
THAT IS ALL THAT LIFE IS TO LEARN THE UNKNOWN AND TO ADAPT OUR ACTIONS TO THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE
ALL MEN THEN BOUND TOGETHER BY STATE ORGANIZATION THROW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR ACTS ON ONE ANOTHER THE PEASANT SOLDIER ON THE NOBLEMAN OR MERCHANT WHO IS HIS OFFICER AND THE OFFICER ON THE NOBLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR ON THE NOBLEMAN OR SON OF AN OFFICIAL WHO IS MINISTER THE MINISTER ON THE MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY WHO OCCUPIES THE POST OF TZAR AND THE TZAR AGAIN ON ALL THESE OFFICIALS NOBLEMEN MERCHANTS AND PEASANTS
AT ONE OF THE RAILWAY STATIONS MY TRAIN PASSED AN EXTRA TRAIN WHICH WAS TAKING A TROOP OF SOLDIERS UNDER THE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE TOGETHER WITH MUSKETS CARTRIDGES AND RODS TO FLOG AND MURDER THESE SAME FAMISHING PEASANTS
IT IS USUALLY SUPPOSED THAT UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AND THE INCREASED ARMAMENTS CONNECTED WITH IT AS WELL AS THE RESULTING INCREASE OF TAXES AND NATIONAL DEBTS ARE A PASSING PHENOMENON PRODUCED BY THE PARTICULAR POLITICAL SITUATION OF EUROPE AND THAT IT MAY BE REMOVED BY CERTAIN POLITICAL COMBINATIONS WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATION OF THE INNER ORDER OF LIFE
THE WOMEN WENT TO THE DYKES OVERTURNED THE CARTS AND DROVE AWAY THE MEN
THE PEASANTS BEGAN TO DEFEND THEIR WIVES AND MOTHERS WOULD NOT LET THEM GO AND BEAT THE POLICE AND THEIR OFFICER
THEY HOLD THAT WE MUST CONTINUE LIKE THE POLICE OFFICER'S PEASANTS TO FLOG ONE ANOTHER CONSOLING OURSELVES WITH THE REFLECTION THAT WE ARE TALKING AWAY IN THE ASSEMBLIES AND MEETINGS FOUNDING TRADES UNIONS MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS ON THE 1ST OF MAY GETTING UP CONSPIRACIES AND STEALTHILY TEASING THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS FLOGGING US AND THAT THROUGH ALL THIS IT WILL BE BROUGHT TO PASS THAT BY ENSLAVING OURSELVES IN CLOSER AND CLOSER BONDAGE WE SHALL VERY SOON BE FREE
THEIR TOTAL SUM AMOUNTS TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS STERLING AND THESE DEBTS ARE INCREASING EVERY YEAR THE SAME PROFESSOR KOMAROVSKY SAYS IN ANOTHER PLACE
SHE DOES NOT KNOW
AND THEREFORE ALL THEIR EFFORTS OUGHT TO BE DIRECTED NOT TO GOING SO FAR AS THEIR STRENGTH ALLOWS IN THE DIRECTION THEY OUGHT TO GO BUT TO STANDING STILL AND CONSTRUCTING SUCH A FLOOR
HE KNOWS THAT THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNOR OF OREL HAS CALLED DOWN UPON HIM THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE BEST PEOPLE AND HE HIMSELF INFLUENCED BY THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE CIRCLES IN WHICH HE MOVES HAS MORE THAN ONCE EXPRESSED HIS DISAPPROBATION OF HIM
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH AND REFUSE TO TELL A LIE ABOUT IT
IT IS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THE MEN AT A LOWER STAGE OF CULTURE THE MEN AND THE NATIONS WHO ARE REPRESENTED AS THE OBSTACLE TO THE REALIZATION OF THE CHRISTIAN ORDER OF LIFE ARE THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS PASS OVER IN MASSES ALL AT ONCE TO ANY TRUTH THAT HAS ONCE BEEN RECOGNIZED BY PUBLIC OPINION
BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO AGAINST MEN WHO WITHOUT WISHING TO OVERTURN OR DESTROY ANYTHING DESIRE SIMPLY FOR THEIR PART TO DO NOTHING AGAINST THE LAW OF CHRIST AND WHO THEREFORE REFUSE TO PERFORM THE COMMONEST STATE REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE THEREFORE THE MOST INDISPENSABLE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE STATE
THEY QUOTE ALL THOSE SAYINGS OF CHRIST'S WHICH CAN POSSIBLY BE INTERPRETED AS JUSTIFICATION OF CRUELTY
BUT THE MORE COMPLEX AND THE LARGER SOCIETIES BECOME AND ESPECIALLY THE MORE OFTEN CONQUEST BECOMES THE CAUSE OF THE AMALGAMATION OF PEOPLE INTO A STATE THE MORE OFTEN INDIVIDUALS STRIVE TO ATTAIN THEIR OWN AIMS AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE AND THE MORE OFTEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN THESE INSUBORDINATE INDIVIDUALS BY RECOURSE TO AUTHORITY THAT IS TO VIOLENCE
ANOTHER SECTION REGARD IT AS SOMETHING CRUEL AND HIDEOUS BUT AT THE SAME TIME FATED AND INEVITABLE LIKE DISEASE AND DEATH
THIS DOCTRINE WAS ACCEPTED AT THE TIME BY ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DISCIPLES
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CASUAL PERSONAL LIFE WHICH NOW COMES INTO BEING AND TO-MORROW IS NO MORE CAN HAVE NO PERMANENCE THAT NO EXTERNAL MEANS NO CONSTRUCTION OF IT CAN GIVE IT CONSECUTIVENESS AND PERMANENCE
THEY TOO KNEW THAT WHAT THEY WERE SENT TO DO WAS A SHAMEFUL THING BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS BEFORE THEM
AND HE CANNOT HELP SUFFERING FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS CONTRADICTION AND HIS SHARE IN IT
IF THERE WERE A MODERATELY LARGE MINORITY OF SUCH MEN THEY WOULD EXERCISE SUCH A SALUTARY MORAL INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY THAT EVERY CRUEL PUNISHMENT WOULD BE ABOLISHED AND VIOLENCE AND FEUD WOULD BE REPLACED BY PEACE AND LOVE
TRUE PEACE IS BASED ON MUTUAL CONFIDENCE WHILE THESE HUGE ARMAMENTS SHOW OPEN AND UTTER LACK OF CONFIDENCE IF NOT CONCEALED HOSTILITY BETWEEN STATES
TO THE MAJORITY OF LEARNED THEN LOOKING AT THE LIVING MORAL TEACHING OF CHRIST FROM THE LOWER STANDPOINT OF THE CONCEPTION OF LIFE THIS DOCTRINE APPEARS AS NOTHING BUT VERY INDEFINITE AND INCONGRUOUS COMBINATION OF INDIAN ASCETICISM STOIC AND NEOPLATONIC PHILOSOPHY AND INSUBSTANTIAL ANTI-SOCIAL VISIONS WHICH HAVE NO SERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE FOR OUR TIMES
THE MORE WIDELY TRUE CHRISTIANITY WAS DIFFUSED AND THE MORE IT PENETRATED MEN'S CONSCIENCE THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS FOR CHRISTIANS TO BE RULERS AND THE EASIER IT BECAME FOR NON-CHRISTIANS TO RULE THEM
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PENAL CODE OF THE OLD COVENANT--AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH--HAS BEEN ABROGATED BY JESUS CHRIST AND THAT UNDER THE NEW COVENANT THE FORGIVENESS INSTEAD OF THE PUNISHMENT OF ENEMIES HAS BEEN ENJOINED ON ALL HIS DISCIPLES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER
THIS IS JUST HOW MEN OF TO-DAY HUDDLE IN TERROR AND DRAW BACK TO THEIR IRRATIONAL MANNER OF LIFE THEIR FACTORIES LAW COURTS PRISONS EXECUTIONS AND WARS WHEN CHRISTIANITY CALLS THEM TO LIBERTY TO THE FREE RATIONAL LIFE OF THE FUTURE COMING AGE
ALL MEN ARE EQUAL AND THE TZAR IS A MAN LIKE US
TO SAY THAT ALL THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEFORE THEM IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEY ARE PREPARED FOR IT
ONE REASON IS THAT PEOPLE SUPPOSE THEY HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT WHEN THEY HAVE DECIDED AS THE CHURCHMEN DO THAT IT WAS REVEALED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS OR WHEN THEY HAVE STUDIED AS THE SCIENTIFIC MEN DO THE EXTERNAL FORMS IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN MANIFESTED
I INDENTED PARAGRAPHS FOR CLARITY WHEN TOLSTOY QUOTES LARGE BLOCKS OF TEXT FROM OTHER AUTHORS
OR TO RECEIVE A SALARY FOR DEVOTING ONE'S WHOLE LIFE TO CONSTRUCTING THESE INSTRUMENTS OF BUTCHERY OR TO PREPARING ONESELF AND OTHERS FOR THE WORK OF MURDER
IT SEEMS THAT IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE LEARNED MEN OF OUR TIME THE HEBREW LAW--A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AND AN EYE FOR AN EYE--IS A LAW OF JUST RETALIATION KNOWN TO MANKIND FIVE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE LAW OF HOLINESS WHICH CHRIST TAUGHT IN ITS PLACE
CATECHISM OF NON-RESISTANCE
ABOVE ALL OUR AUTHOR PROVES THE BINDING NATURE OF THE RULE OF NON-RESISTANCE FOR A CHRISTIAN POINTING OUT THAT THIS COMMAND IS PERFECTLY CLEAR AND IS ENJOINED UPON EVERY CHRISTIAN BY CHRIST WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF MISINTERPRETATION
AND FINDING THAT THESE TENETS HAVE LOST ALL THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHRISTIANITY THEY ACCEPT IT AS A RELIGION WHICH HAS OUTLIVED ITS AGE
BUT IF THAT IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE RULE OF NON-RESISTANCE CAN IT ALWAYS PUT INTO PRACTICE
THIS AND NOTHING BUT THIS IS THE FAITH TAUGHT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF RUSSIA BY THE WHOLE OF THE RUSSIAN CLERGY AND OF LATE YEARS WITH ESPECIAL ZEAL
WE ARE RUINING OURSELVES SAYS FREDERICK PASSY IN A LETTER READ BEFORE THE LAST CONGRESS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE IN 1890 IN LONDON WE ARE RUINING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PART IN THE SENSELESS WARS OF THE FUTURE OR TO PAY THE INTEREST ON DEBTS WE HAVE INCURRED BY THE SENSELESS AND CRIMINAL WARS OF THE PAST
THE ONLY UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT GERMANY RUSSIA AUSTRIA AND FRANCE HAVE NOT SO FAR SHOWN THE SAME INCLINATION
IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A CHURCH WHICH DECIDED IN THE YEAR 51 TO RECEIVE THE UNCIRCUMCISED IT IS ONLY SO BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER CHURCH--OF THE JUDAISTS--WHO DECIDED TO KEEP THE UNCIRCUMCISED OUT
FIRMLY RELYING UPON THE CERTAIN AND UNIVERSAL TRIUMPH OF THE SENTIMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS DECLARATION HOWEVER FORMIDABLE MAY BE THE OPPOSITION ARRAYED AGAINST THEM WE HEREBY AFFIX OUR SIGNATURES TO IT
WE THE UNDERSIGNED REGARD IT AS DUE TO OURSELVES TO THE CAUSE WHICH WE LOVE TO THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE LIVE TO PUBLISH A DECLARATION EXPRESSIVE OF THE PURPOSES WE AIM TO ACCOMPLISH AND THE MEASURES WE SHALL ADOPT TO CARRY FORWARD THE WORK OF PEACEFUL UNIVERSAL REFORMATION
AFTER HIS DEATH IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIS RELATIVES THAT IT IS A GOOD THING FOR THE SALVATION OF THE DEAD MAN TO PLACE A PRINTED PAPER OF PRAYERS IN HIS HANDS
WE REGARD THE PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED BY LAW AS CRUEL AND SHAMELESS BUT WE MUST ASSIST IN SUPPORTING THEM
AND TO BRING THIS TO PASS NOTHING NEW NEED BE BROUGHT BEFORE MEN'S MINDS
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THIS RUSSIAN CHURCH THIS IMMENSE INTENSELY ACTIVE INSTITUTION WHICH CONSISTS OF A REGIMENT OF HALF A MILLION MEN AND COSTS THE PEOPLE TENS OF MILLIONS OF RUBLES
NOWADAYS WE SEE ADVOCATED NOT ONLY PATRIOTISM AND ARISTOCRATIC PRINCIPLES JUST AS THEY WERE ADVOCATED TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO BUT EVEN THE COARSEST EPICUREANISM AND ANIMALISM ONLY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE MEN WHO THEN PROFESSED THOSE VIEWS BELIEVED IN THEM WHILE NOWADAYS EVEN THE ADVOCATES OF SUCH VIEWS DO NOT BELIEVE IN THEM FOR THEY HAVE NO MEANING FOR THE PRESENT DAY
NOWHERE NOR IN ANYTHING EXCEPT IN THE ASSERTION OF THE CHURCH CAN WE FIND THAT GOD OR CHRIST FOUNDED ANYTHING LIKE WHAT CHURCHMEN UNDERSTAND BY THE CHURCH
THE CHIEF PECULIARITY WHICH DISTINGUISHED CHRIST'S TEACHING FROM PREVIOUS RELIGIONS CONSISTED IN THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO ACCEPTED IT STROVE EVER MORE AND MORE TO COMPREHEND AND REALIZE ITS TEACHING
IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT IF CHRISTIANITY IS A TRUTH IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE DIRECTLY IT APPEARED AND OUGHT TO HAVE TRANSFORMED MEN'S LIVES FOR THE BETTER
AND IT HAS REACHED SUCH PROPORTIONS THAT IF WE WERE NOT LIVING IN ITS MIDST WE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MEN COULD ATTAIN SUCH A PITCH OF SELF-DECEPTION
BUT NOW CASES OF REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH THE UNCHRISTIAN DEMANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE STRIKING AT THE VERY ROOT OF STATE AUTHORITY BECAUSE THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE IS BASED ON THE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE UNCHRISTIAN DEMANDS
THE FREETHINKING RUSSIAN CRITICS TAKING MY BOOK AS THOUGH ITS WHOLE CONTENTS COULD BE REDUCED TO NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL AND UNDERSTANDING THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL ITSELF NO DOUBT FOR GREATER CONVENIENCE IN REFUTING IT AS THOUGH IT WOULD PROHIBIT EVERY KIND OF CONFLICT WITH EVIL FELL VEHEMENTLY UPON THIS DOCTRINE AND FOR SOME YEARS PAST HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY PROVING THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING IS MISTAKEN IN SO FAR AS IT FORBIDS RESISTANCE TO EVIL
THE SAME LOFTILY VAGUE DISCUSSIONS OF CHRISTIANITY IN BOOKS AND SERMONS AND WHEN IT COMES TO PRACTICE THE SAME SUPPORTING OF THE PRESENT IDOLATRY
ONE INVOLUNTARILY ASKS HOW CAN MEN LET IT GO ON NOT FROM HIGHER CONSIDERATIONS ONLY BUT FROM REGARD TO THEIR OWN SAFETY
IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT AMONG US WHERE ONE CANNOT SAY A WORD ABOUT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES WITHOUT THE PROHIBITION OF THE CENSORSHIP FOR SOME YEARS PAST THERE HAVE BEEN IN ALL THE JOURNALS CONSTANT ATTACKS AND CRITICISMS ON THE COMMAND OF CHRIST SIMPLY AND DIRECTLY STATED IN MATT
A SINGLE EXECUTION CARRIED OUT BY PROSPEROUS EDUCATED MEN UNINFLUENCED BY PASSION WITH THE APPROBATION AND ASSISTANCE OF CHRISTIAN MINISTERS AND REPRESENTED AS SOMETHING NECESSARY AND EVEN JUST IS INFINITELY MORE CORRUPTING AND BRUTALIZING TO MEN THAN THOUSANDS OF MURDERS COMMITTED BY UNEDUCATED WORKING PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION
GOVERNMENTS CAN OF COURSE FLOG TO DEATH OR EXECUTE OR KEEP IN PERPETUAL IMPRISONMENT ALL ENEMIES WHO WANT TO OVERTURN THEM BY VIOLENCE THEY CAN LAVISH GOLD ON THAT SECTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READY TO DESTROY THEIR ENEMIES
SIGNIFICANCE OF COMPULSORY SERVICE
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TAUGHT
IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THIS FEELING THAT WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT FOLLOW HE SENT IN A CLAIM TO BE REINSTATED IN HIS PRETENDED RIGHTS
IT SEEMS TO ME THEREFORE THAT IN SUCH A STATE OF THINGS ONE OF TWO ALTERNATIVES MUST BE ADMITTED
A MAN LOVES HIMSELF HIS ANIMAL PERSONALITY HE LOVES HIS FAMILY HE EVEN LOVES HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
THUS THE LANDOWNER WHO CLAIMED THE FOREST ACTED AS HE DID ONLY BECAUSE HE FANCIED HIMSELF NOT A SIMPLE MAN HAVING THE SAME RIGHTS TO LIFE AS THE PEASANTS LIVING BESIDE HIM AND EVERYONE ELSE BUT A GREAT LANDOWNER A MEMBER OF THE NOBILITY AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTOXICATION OF POWER HE FELT HIS DIGNITY OFFENDED BY THE PEASANTS CLAIMS
ONLY UNDER THE INTOXICATION OF THE POWER OR THE SERVILITY OF THEIR IMAGINED POSITIONS COULD ALL THESE PEOPLE ACT AS THEY DO
IT IS SIMPLY THE THEORY OF LIFE WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO THE PRESENT DEGREE OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT THE PRESENT STAGE OF GROWTH OF HUMANITY AND WHICH MUST THEREFORE INEVITABLY BE ACCEPTED
IN THIS WAY THEY DEGRADE SOCIETY BELOW PAGANISM TO A STATE OF PRIMEVAL BARBARISM--UNDEFINED ATTITUDE OF MODERN LEADERS OF THOUGHT TO WAR TO UNIVERSAL MILITARISM AND TO COMPULSORY SERVICE IN ARMY--ONE SECTION REGARDS WAR AS AN ACCIDENTAL POLITICAL PHENOMENON TO BE AVOIDED BY EXTERNAL MEASURES ONLY--PEACE CONGRESS--THE ARTICLE IN THE REVUE DES REVUES--PROPOSITION OF MAXIME DU CAMP--VALUE OF BOARDS OF ARBITRATION AND SUPPRESSION OF ARMIES--ATTITUDE OF GOVERNMENTS TO MEN OF THIS OPINION AND WHAT THEY DO--ANOTHER SECTION REGARDS WAR AS CRUEL BUT INEVITABLE--MAUPASSANT--ROD--A THIRD SECTION REGARD WAR AS NECESSARY AND NOT WITHOUT ITS ADVANTAGES--DOUCET-CLARETIE-ZOLA-VOGUE
HOW CAN I HELP ASKING MYSELF WHEN I TAKE PART IN SUCH PUNISHMENTS WHETHER THEY ARE JUST AND WHETHER I OUGHT TO ASSIST IN CARRYING THEM OUT
AND THERE ARE EVEN RICH MEN WHO NOT THROUGH RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT BUT SIMPLY THROUGH SPECIAL SENSITIVENESS TO THE SOCIAL STANDARD THAT IS SPRINGING UP RELINQUISH THEIR INHERITED PROPERTY BELIEVING THAT A MAN CAN ONLY JUSTLY CONSUME WHAT HE HAS GAINED BY HIS OWN LABOR
ON THE CONTRARY WARNING IS GIVEN PRECISELY AGAINST THIS TREACHEROUS AND SCANDALOUS RESTRICTION WHICH NULLIFIES THE COMMANDMENT
AT THE BIRTH OF A CHILD THEY TEACH THEM THAT THEY MUST RECITE A PRAYER OVER THE CHILD AND MOTHER TO PURIFY THEM AS THOUGH WITHOUT THIS PRAYER THE MOTHER OF A NEWBORN CHILD WERE UNCLEAN
JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS WHO DO NOT LIKE TO TRY AND TO CONDEMN CRIMINALS
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY FOR THE OFFICER TO DISPERSE IT
THE OFFICIALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS NOT ONLY ASSISTED IN IT BUT WERE EVEN PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AFFAIR SINCE BY THEIR PRESENCE THEY PREVENTED ANY INTERFERENCE ON THE PART OF THE CROWD
DIRECTLY FACING HIM IN THE REVISION OFFICE HANGS IN A GREAT GOLD FRAME A PORTRAIT OF THE TZAR IN FULL UNIFORM WITH DECORATIONS AND IN THE CORNER A LITTLE PORTRAIT OF CHRIST IN A SHIRT AND A CROWN OF THORNS
UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE MAY BE COMPARED TO THE EFFORTS OF A MAN TO PROP UP HIS FALLING HOUSE WHO SO SURROUNDS IT AND FILLS IT WITH PROPS AND BUTTRESSES AND PLANKS AND SCAFFOLDING THAT HE MANAGES TO KEEP THE HOUSE STANDING ONLY BY MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN IT
IT CONDEMNS EVERY KIND OF CRUELTY WHETHER SHOWN IN BLOWS IN ILL-TREATMENT OR IN MURDER NOT ONLY OF MEN BUT EVEN OF ANIMALS
AND THEREFORE TO ASSERT OF ONE'S SELF OR OF ANY BODY OF MEN THAT ONE IS OR THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF PERFECT UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT OF CHRIST'S WORD IS TO RENOUNCE THE VERY SPIRIT OF CHRIST'S TEACHING
ALL DEPLORE THIS STATE OF THINGS--NEITHER PEACE NOR WAR--AND ALL WOULD BE GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM IT
IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE SAVAGE ELEMENTS EXISTING IN THE MIDST OF OUR CIVILIZED SOCIETIES
WITH US IN RUSSIA BESIDES OTHER MEANS THEY EMPLOY SIMPLE BRUTE FORCE AS THERE THE TEMPORAL POWER IS WILLING TO OBEY THE CHURCH
THIS MASS ALWAYS HINDERS BY ITS INERTIA FREQUENT AND RAPID REVOLUTIONS IN THE SOCIAL ORDER WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PROVED BY HUMAN EXPERIENCE
BUT THE NATURAL AND HONORABLE SENTIMENTS OF NATIONAL HONOR AND PATRIOTISM ARE SO EXAGGERATED AND THE PUBLIC OPINION OF ONE NATION SO EXCITED AGAINST ANOTHER THAT IT IS ENOUGH FOR A STATEMENT TO BE MADE EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE A FALSE REPORT THAT THE AMBASSADOR OF ONE STATE WAS NOT RECEIVED BY THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGE OF ANOTHER STATE TO CAUSE THE OUTBREAK OF THE MOST AWFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE WAR THERE HAS EVER BEEN SEEN
THEY DRESS HIM UP IN A CLOWN'S COSTUME AND ORDER HIM TO CUT CAPERS TURN AND TWIST AND BOW AND KILL--HE DOES IT ALL SUBMISSIVELY
IT IS THE SAME WITH ALL OTHER CRIMES
OR THE SENSELESSNESS OF INFLICTING PUNISHMENTS ON WEAK OR DEPRAVED PERSONS IN THE SHAPE OF TRANSPORTATION FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER OR OF IMPRISONMENT IN A FORTRESS WHERE LIVING IN SECURITY AND INDOLENCE THEY ONLY BECOME WEAKER AND MORE DEPRAVED
HE BEGINS BY LAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE THE LOGICAL FOUNDATION OF HIS DOCTRINES STRINGING TOGETHER QUOTATIONS FROM LITTLE-KNOWN THEOLOGICAL WRITERS AND HE KEEPS HIS OWN INCISIVE LOGIC FOR THE LATER PART OF THE BOOK
TILL EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN MAKES THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE HIS OWN AND BEGINS TO LIVE IN ACCORD WITH IT THERE CAN BE NO SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN LIFE AND NO ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FORM OF LIFE
THE CATHOLICS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED WITHOUT A BREAK IN THEIR PRIESTHOOD
AGAIN THEY WRITE TO PETERSBURG AND THENCE COMES THE DECREE TO TRANSFER THE YOUNG MAN TO SOME DIVISION OF THE ARMY STATIONED ON THE FRONTIER IN SOME PLACE WHERE THE ARMY IS UNDER MARTIAL LAW WHERE HE CAN BE SHOT FOR REFUSING TO OBEY AND WHERE THE MATTER CAN PROCEED WITHOUT ATTRACTING OBSERVATION SEEING THAT THERE ARE FEW RUSSIANS AND CHRISTIANS IN SUCH A DISTANT PART BUT THE MAJORITY ARE FOREIGNERS AND MOHAMMEDANS
SINCE I COULD NOT OBTAIN THE BOOK ITSELF I TRIED TO MAKE MYSELF ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT WAS KNOWN OF HELCHITSKY AND I GAINED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM A GERMAN BOOK SENT ME BY THE PRAGUE PROFESSOR AND FROM PYPIN'S HISTORY OF TSECH LITERATURE
AND THIS CONTRADICTION FOR MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY HAS BECOME SO FULL OF HORROR THAT WITHOUT ITS SOLUTION LIFE IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE
IT IS PASSING THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THE THROES OF BIRTH
TRY THE EXPERIMENT OF CEASING TO COMMIT THE CRUEL TREACHEROUS AND BASE ACTIONS THAT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY COMMITTING IN ORDER TO RETAIN YOUR POSITION AND YOU WILL LOSE IT AT ONCE
IF MEN COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO DO THESE THINGS THEN THEY WILL CEASE TO BE
SO IT WAS UNDERSTOOD AT ITS VERY COMMENCEMENT
NO SEVERITIES COULD PUT AN END TO DUELS AND VENDETTAS IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS
THAT SUCH A CONVICTION IS PARTLY DUE TO MY WANT OF KNOWLEDGE MY IGNORANCE OF HISTORY MY IGNORANCE OF ALL THE VAIN ATTEMPTS TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT TO LIFE WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN HISTORY AND HAVE LED TO NOTHING
WHAT HE DOES THROUGH OTHERS HE IS IN REALITY DOING HIMSELF
BUT SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THESE THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU
THESE PEOPLE ADVANCE THE OPINION THAT THE AMELIORATION OF LIFE THE BRINGING OF THE FACTS OF LIFE INTO HARMONY WITH THE CONSCIENCE WILL COME NOT AS THE RESULT OF THE PERSONAL EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEN BUT OF ITSELF AS THE RESULT OF A CERTAIN POSSIBLE RECONSTRUCTION OF SOCIETY EFFECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER

THEIR MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOVED THEM FOR TWENTY YEARS WORSHIPED THEM AS NONE BUT MOTHERS CAN WILL LEARN IN SIX MONTHS TIME OR A YEAR PERHAPS THAT THEIR SON THEIR BOY THE BIG BOY REARED WITH SO MUCH LABOR SO MUCH EXPENSE SO MUCH LOVE HAS BEEN THROWN IN A HOLE LIKE SOME DEAD DOG AFTER BEING DISEMBOWELED BY A BULLET AND TRAMPLED CRUSHED TO A MASS OF PULP BY THE CHARGES OF CAVALRY
AS THE MAN OF THE STALE CONCEPTION OF LIFE SAID TO THE SAVAGE
THE DESTINY OF HUMANITY IN THE WORLD DEPENDS SO FAR AS IT DEPENDS ON MEN AT ALL ON THEIR FIDELITY TO THEIR RELIGION
BE CALLED A FIELD-MARSHAL AND GET A LOT OF MONEY
TO RECOGNIZE THIS CLEARLY IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE A MAN OUT OF HIS SENSES OR TO MAKE HIM SHOOT HIMSELF
THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT OR THE NICENE CREED--THE ONE EXCLUDES THE OTHER
IT IS ONLY THEN THAT THE PRINCIPLES PRESENTED IN CHRIST'S TEACHING APPEAR TO BE DESTRUCTIVE OF LIFE
PEACE THEN TO ALL WHO SEEK PEACE AND MAY OVERRULING LOVE BE THE IMPERISHABLE HERITAGE OF EVERY SOUL WHO OBEYS WILLINGLY CHRIST'S WORD RESIST NOT EVIL ADIN BALLOU
I THINK IT IS MAX MULLER WHO DESCRIBES THE AMAZEMENT OF AN INDIAN CONVERT TO CHRISTIANITY WHO AFTER ABSORBING THE ESSENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE CAME TO EUROPE AND SAW THE ACTUAL LIFE OF CHRISTIANS
ALL THESE MEN ARE IN A POSITION LIKE THAT OF A MAN UNDER HYPNOTISM COMMANDED TO DO SOMETHING OPPOSED TO EVERYTHING HE REGARDS AS GOOD AND RATIONAL SUCH AS TO KILL HIS MOTHER OR HIS CHILD
FOR IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD THERE WERE SEVERAL WOMEN AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHICH ONE WAS TO BE ARRESTED
ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S DOCTRINE THE MAN WHO SEES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LIFE IN THE DOMAIN IN WHICH IT IS NOT FREE IN THE DOMAIN OF EFFECTS THAT IS OF ACTS HAS NOT THE TRUE LIFE
THERE ARE PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF QUAKERS MENNONITES ALL OUR DOUHOBORTSI MOLOKANI AND OTHERS WHO DO NOT BELONG TO ANY DEFINITE SECT WHO CONSIDER THAT THE USE OF FORCE--AND CONSEQUENTLY MILITARY SERVICE--IS INCONSISTENT WITH CHRISTIANITY
AND WHATEVER THE MAN MAY DO THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME CAUSES OR OTHER THROUGH WHICH HE DOES THESE OR THOSE ACTS AND THEREFORE MAN CANNOT BE FREE AND CHANGE HIS LIFE SAY THE CHAMPIONS OF THE METAPHYSICS OF HYPOCRISY
THESE VIOLENT HOSTILITIES WERE CARRIED ON ON A LARGE AND ON A SMALL SCALE
AND YET THEY ARE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OF REACHING THE PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE REDUCED TO THE INEVITABLE NECESSITY OF COMMITTING THIS CRIME
SO THAT THERE IS BUT ONE STRICT AND EXACT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A CHURCH NOT OF SOMETHING FANTASTIC WHICH WE WOULD WISH IT TO BE BUT OF WHAT IT IS AND HAS BEEN IN REALITY)--A CHURCH IS A BODY OF MEN WHO CLAIM FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLETE AND SOLE POSSESSION OF THE TRUTH
AND TO BE ANXIOUS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES WHEN THEIR VERY EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON THEIR OPPRESSION
THEY THINK AND SAY THAT TO FOLLOW CHRIST'S TEACHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE COMPLETE FULFILLMENT OF ALL THAT IS REQUIRED BY THIS TEACHING WOULD PUT AN END TO LIFE
THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM SAYS
AND SO THEY FLOGGED ONE ANOTHER UNTIL A SIMPLETON WAS FOUND WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE FLOGGED AND SHOUTED TO HIS COMPANIONS NOT TO FLOG ONE ANOTHER
THIS ASSERTION IS AN ABSOLUTE ASSUMPTION AND ONE CANNOT FIND IN ALL CHRIST'S TEACHING ANY CONFIRMATION OF SUCH AN ARGUMENT
NOT THAT A MAN IS ALWAYS FREE TO RECOGNIZE OR TO REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE EVERY TRUTH
ALL THE EVIL SEEMS TO EXIST THROUGH SOME CAUSE INDEPENDENT OF THE CONSCIENCE OF MEN
WAR BREAKS OUT
IF WE ONLY DO IT IN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE NOTHING CAN BE MORE CHRISTIAN THAN SUCH MURDER IN ANOTHER PAMPHLET ENTITLED HOW MANY MEN ARE NECESSARY TO CHANGE A CRIME INTO A VIRTUE HE SAYS
MEN SEE THAT THERE IS SOME INCONSISTENCY HERE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO ANALYZE IT INVOLUNTARILY ASSUME THAT THIS APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS ONLY THE RESULT OF THEIR IGNORANCE
AND HE FEELS HIMSELF INDEPENDENT NOT ONLY OF FACTS EXTERNAL TO HIS OWN PERSONALITY BUT EVEN OF HIS OWN ACTIONS
BUT THIS ONLY DISPLEASES US BECAUSE THESE ARE NEW PRACTICES
WE MUST OVERTURN IT AND SUBSTITUTE THIS OR THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT
WE DIFFUSE AMONG THE COMMON HERD IDOLATROUS SUPERSTITIONS TO STUPEFY THEM
YOU MUST BECOME MY SLAVE AND THIS SLAVERY MAY FORCE YOU TO KILL EVEN YOUR OWN FATHER AND HE OFTEN VERY WELL EDUCATED TRAINED IN ALL THE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY QUIETLY PUTS HIS HEAD UNDER THE YOKE
IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY SECURUS JUDICAT ORBIS TERRARUM AND OF THIS KIND WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE ALL THE CRITICISMS OF EDUCATED BELIEVERS WHO MUST AS SUCH UNDERSTAND THE DANGER OF THEIR POSITION
HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS A CHARACTERISTIC VIEW OF THAT KIND FROM THE AMERICAN JOURNAL THE ARENA OCTOBER 1890
IF THERE WERE NO SOLDIERS OR ARMED POLICEMEN READY TO KILL OR OUTRAGE ANYONE AS THEY ARE ORDERED NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SIGN SENTENCES OF DEATH IMPRISONMENT OR GALLEY-SLAVERY FOR LIFE WOULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HANG IMPRISON OR TORTURE A THOUSANDTH PART OF THOSE WHOM QUIETLY SITTING IN HIS STUDY HE NOW ORDERS TO BE TORTURED IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT SEE IT NOR DO IT HIMSELF BUT ONLY GETS IT DONE AT A DISTANCE BY THESE SERVILE TOOLS
THE CONGRESS RECOMMENDS THIS RESOLUTION TO THE ATTENTION OF EUROPEAN STATESMEN AND EXPRESSES THE ARDENT DESIRE THAT SIMILAR TREATIES MAY SPEEDILY BE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD
THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PRIVILEGES EXIST APART AND ARE THE RESULT OF FREE CONTRACT AMONG PEOPLE
THEY FINE THESE PEOPLE TRYING NOT TO LET THEM HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING THEIR MOTIVES IN PUBLIC AND REPLACE THEM BY OTHERS
I ASKED THE OLD MAN HAS HE THE GOSPEL NO GIVE HIM THE GOSPEL IN RUSSIAN I SAID TO THE MONK
THERE THE CHIEF OFFICER OF THE DIVISION WHICH HE ENTERS AGAIN EXPECTS THE YOUNG MAN TO PERFORM HIS MILITARY DUTIES AND AGAIN HE REFUSES TO OBEY AND IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER SOLDIERS EXPLAINS THE REASON OF HIS REFUSAL SAYING THAT HE AS A CHRISTIAN CANNOT VOLUNTARILY PREPARE HIMSELF TO COMMIT MURDER WHICH IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAW OF MOSES
ALL THE EVIL OF OUR LIFE SEEMS TO EXIST ONLY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SO FOR SO LONG
AND THAT IS THE THIRD COMMAND
WHEN LOUIS XVI
THE STORY IS THAT THERE WAS ONCE AN EMPEROR VERY FOND OF NEW CLOTHES
WHY SHOULD I GO WASTING MY TIME AND HOODWINKING MYSELF GIVING TO MISCREANT EVILDOERS A SEMBLANCE OF LEGALITY BY TAKING PART IN ELECTIONS AND PRETENDING THAT I AM TAKING PART IN THE GOVERNMENT WHEN I KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE REAL CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE GOT HOLD OF THE ARMY
YET WITHOUT EVEN TAKING THE PAINS TO ENTER INTO THEIR MEANING THEY REFUSE IF UNFAVORABLY DISPOSED TO RECOGNIZE ANY REASONABLENESS IN HIS DOCTRINES
IT WAS MADNESS TO SET OFF UPON THE OCEAN NOT KNOWING THE ROUTE ON THE OCEAN ON WHICH NO ONE HAD SAILED TO SAIL TOWARD A LAND WHOSE EXISTENCE WAS DOUBTFUL
EIGHTEEN CENTURIES OF CHRISTIANITY HAVE NOT PASSED WITHOUT AN EFFECT EVEN ON THOSE WHO ACCEPTED IT ONLY EXTERNALLY
SOME OF THEM RAN ALONG THE PLATFORM TO DRINK SOME WATER FROM A TUB THERE AND WHEN THEY MET THE OFFICERS THEY SLACKENED THEIR PACE MADE THEIR STUPID GESTURE OF SALUTATION RAISING THEIR HANDS TO THEIR HEADS WITH SERIOUS FACES AS THOUGH THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE
ASK THE BISHOPS AND MEN IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY WHY THEY DO SO AND THEY WILL SAY THEY DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE WHILE THE PEOPLE KISS THEM BECAUSE THE BISHOPS AND MEN IN AUTHORITY DO SO
WHEN I INQUIRED OF ONE OF THE GOVERNORS WHY THEY MADE USE OF THIS KIND OF TORTURE WHEN PEOPLE HAD ALREADY SUBMITTED AND SOLDIERS WERE STATIONED IN THE VILLAGE HE REPLIED WITH THE IMPORTANT AIR OF A MAN WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS ALL THE SUBTLETIES OF STATECRAFT THAT IF THE PEASANTS WERE NOT THOROUGHLY SUBDUED BY FLOGGING THEY WOULD BEGIN OFFERING OPPOSITION TO THE DECISIONS OF AUTHORITIES AGAIN
THESE FIGURES REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE REAL COST BECAUSE BESIDES THE RECOGNIZED EXPENDITURE OF THE WAR BUDGET OF THE VARIOUS NATIONS WE OUGHT ALSO TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENORMOUS LOSS TO SOCIETY INVOLVED IN WITHDRAWING FROM IT SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF ITS MOST VIGOROUS MEN WHO ARE TAKEN FROM INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS AND EVERY KIND OF LABOR AS WELL AS THE ENORMOUS INTEREST ON THE SUMS EXPENDED ON MILITARY PREPARATIONS WITHOUT ANY RETURN
THE CHRISTIAN MAY BE SUBJECTED TO EXTERNAL VIOLENCE HE MAY BE DEPRIVED OF BODILY FREEDOM HE MAY BE IN BONDAGE TO HIS PASSIONS HE WHO COMMITS SIN IS THE SLAVE OF SIN BUT HE CANNOT BE IN BONDAGE IN THE SENSE OF BEING FORCED BY ANY DANGER OR BY ANY THREAT OF EXTERNAL HARM TO PERFORM AN ACT WHICH IS AGAINST HIS CONSCIENCE
SEND THEIR FLEAS FLYING
AND THESE BODIES HAVING IN COURSE OF TIME AIDED BY THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITIES DEVELOPED INTO POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLES TO THE DIFFUSION OF A TRUE COMPREHENSION OF THE TEACHING OF CHRIST
AND IN THEM IS CHRIST'S PROPHECY FULFILLED
THEY AFFIRM THAT THE AMELIORATION OF HUMAN LIFE IS EFFECTED NOT BY THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEN TO RECOGNIZE AND PROPAGATE THE TRUTH BUT BY THE GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND THAT THEREFORE THE EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS FOR THE BETTER
SEEING 1 THAT THE OBJECT PURSUED BY ALL PEACE SOCIETIES IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF JUDICIAL ORDER BETWEEN NATIONS AND 2 THAT NEUTRALIZATION BY INTERNATIONAL TREATIES CONSTITUTES A STEP TOWARD THIS JUDICIAL STATE AND LESSENS THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IN WHICH WAR CAN BE CARRIED ON THE CONGRESS RECOMMENDS A LARGER EXTENSION OF THE RULE OF NEUTRALIZATION AND EXPRESSES THE WISH 1 THAT ALL TREATIES WHICH AT PRESENT ASSURE TO CERTAIN STATES THE BENEFIT OF NEUTRALITY REMAIN IN FORCE OR IF NECESSARY BE AMENDED IN A MANNER TO RENDER THE NEUTRALITY MORE EFFECTIVE EITHER BY EXTENDING NEUTRALIZATION TO THE WHOLE OF THE STATE OR BY ORDERING THE DEMOLITION OF FORTRESSES WHICH CONSTITUTE RATHER A PERIL THAN A GUARANTEE FOR NEUTRALITY
IT IS MORE LIKE THE WATER FILLING A VESSEL FLOATING ON WATER
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT 150 YEARS AGO
WAS TZAR OR WHEN HE WAS KILLED AND CATHERINE WAS TZARITSA IN ONE-HALF OF RUSSIA AND POUGACHEF RULED THE OTHER
HENCE WE CAN ALLOW NO APPEAL TO PATRIOTISM TO REVENGE ANY NATIONAL INSULT OR INJURY
EVEN NOW MOST IGNORANT PEOPLE--LIKE OUR PEASANTS WHO CALL THE TZAR AN EARTHLY GOD--OBEY STATE LAWS NOT THROUGH ANY RATIONAL RECOGNITION OF THEIR NECESSITY NOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY CONCEPTION OF THE MEANING OF STATE BUT THROUGH A RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT
THUS AN OFFICER OF RESERVE WHO DID NOT REPORT HIS CHANGE OF RESIDENCE AND JUSTIFIED THIS ON THE GROUND THAT HE WOULD NOT SERVE IN THE ARMY ANY LONGER WAS FINED THIRTY RUBLES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDERS OF THE SUPERIOR AUTHORITY
SO WROTE DE VOGUE AND LEROY BEAULIEU AND MATTHEW ARNOLD
THEY DO NOT EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO IT
OTHER MEN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF RUSSIA BEHAVE AS THOUGH BY AGREEMENT PRECISELY IN THE SAME WAY AS THIS YOUNG MAN AND IN ALL THESE CASES THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED THE SAME TIMOROUS UNDECIDED AND SECRETIVE COURSE OF ACTION
FOR ONE OF THE COMMANDERS OF A COMPANY WHO WAS ASKED FOR TROOPS FOR THE RESTORATION OF ORDER TO REPLY THAT SOLDIERS OUGHT NOT TO BE BUTCHERS--AND THANKS TO THESE AND A FEW OTHER SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THESE HYPNOTIZED MEN THE AFFAIR TOOK A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TURN AND THE TROOPS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PLACE DID NOT INFLICT ANY PUNISHMENT BUT CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH CUTTING DOWN THE FOREST AND GIVING IT TO THE LANDOWNER
WE SEE NO NECESSITY FOR WARS AND ARMIES BUT WE MUST BEAR TERRIBLY HEAVY BURDENS IN SUPPORT OF TROOPS AND WAR EXPENSES
THE CHURCHES AS CHURCHES ARE NOT AS MANY PEOPLE SUPPOSE INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES FOR THEIR BASIS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE STRAYED A LITTLE AWAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH
BUT SEEING THAT TO BEGIN WITH MEN DO NOT STAND STILL BUT ARE STEADILY ADVANCING TO A GREATER RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH AND A CLOSER ADAPTATION OF THEIR LIFE TO IT AND SECONDLY ALL MEN IN VARYING DEGREES ACCORDING TO THEIR AGE THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR RACE ARE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TRUTHS AT FIRST THOSE WHO ARE NEAREST TO THE MEN WHO HAVE ATTAINED THE NEW TRUTH BY SPIRITUAL INTUITION SLOWLY AND ONE BY ONE BUT AFTERWARD MORE AND MORE QUICKLY PASS OVER TO THE NEW TRUTH
IS THE RELIGION OF CATHOLICISM ANY OTHER THAN THAT OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH
ONLY BY THE SUPPRESSION OF VIOLENCE WILL A CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION CEASE TO BE CORRUPTED AND BE ENABLED TO BE DIFFUSED WITHOUT HINDRANCE AND MEN WILL THEN TURN THEIR EFFORTS IN THE SPIRITUAL DIRECTION BY WHICH ALONE THEY CAN ADVANCE
THE LIFE OF YOUR INDIVIDUALITY CANNOT BE TRUE LIFE BECAUSE THAT LIFE IS PITIFUL AND PASSING
HAD NOT THEY SOME MEANS OF STIFLING THEIR CONSCIENCE NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD BE CAPABLE OF COMMITTING A HUNDREDTH PART OF SUCH A VILLAINY
BUT AT EVERY STAGE OF HIS JOURNEY HE SEES WHAT IS LIGHTED UP BY THE LANTERN AND HE CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OF THE ROAD
THOUGHT IS PARALYZED BY ANGUISH AND THE MOST IT IS CAPABLE OF IS TO CALCULATE--INTERPRETING THE VAGUE PHRASES OF MINISTERS SPELLING OUT THE SENSE OF THE SPEECHES OF SOVEREIGNS AND RUMINATING ON THE WORDS ATTRIBUTED TO DIPLOMATISTS REPORTED ON THE UNCERTAIN AUTHORITY OF THE NEWSPAPERS--WHETHER IT IS TO BE TO-MORROW OR THE DAY AFTER THIS YEAR OR THE NEXT THAT WE ARE TO BE MURDERED
THE SOLE MEANS OF UNITING MEN IS THEIR UNION IN THE TRUTH
BUT THIS ASSUMPTION THAT WHAT SEEMS EVIL TO US IS REALLY EVIL SHOWS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTION AND LIES AT THE ROOT OF THE ARGUMENT OF FREETHINKING CRITICS ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
TO LOVE ONE'S SELF IS NATURAL TO EVERYONE AND NO ONE NEEDS ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO SO
WHEN ONE'S EYES ARE OPENED TO THIS AWFUL DECEPTION PRACTICED UPON US ONE MARVELS THAT THE TEACHERS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND OF MORALS THE INSTRUCTORS OF YOUTH OR EVEN THE GOOD-HEARTED AND INTELLIGENT PARENTS WHO ARE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY SOCIETY CAN TEACH ANY KIND OF MORALITY IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH IT IS OPENLY ADMITTED IT IS SO ADMITTED UNDER ALL GOVERNMENTS AND ALL CHURCHES THAT MURDER AND TORTURE FORM AN INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT IN THE LIFE OF ALL AND THAT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SPECIAL MEN TRAINED TO KILL THEIR FELLOWS AND THAT ANY ONE OF US MAY HAVE TO BECOME SUCH A TRAINED ASSASSIN
SO THAT THOUGH THE VIOLENCE OF POWER IS LESS NOTICEABLE IN GOVERNMENT THAN WHEN IT IS EMPLOYED BY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE IT FINDS EXPRESSION IN SUBMISSION AND NOT IN STRIFE IT NEVERTHELESS EXISTS AND OFTEN TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN IN FORMER DAYS
THE CHRISTIAN IS INDEPENDENT OF HUMAN AUTHORITY BECAUSE HE ACKNOWLEDGES GOD'S AUTHORITY ALONE
CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NO USE BECAUSE IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR INDUSTRIAL AGE SAYS INGERSOLL NAIVELY EXPRESSING IN THIS UTTERANCE WITH PERFECT DIRECTNESS AND SIMPLICITY THE EXACT NOTION OF CHRIST'S TEACHING HELD BY PERSONS OF REFINEMENT AND CULTURE OF OUR TIMES
EVERYONE KNOWS ON THE CONTRARY THAT MEN IN AUTHORITY--BE THEY EMPERORS MINISTERS GOVERNORS OR POLICE OFFICERS--ARE ALWAYS SIMPLY FROM THE POSSESSION OF POWER MORE LIABLE TO BE DEMORALIZED THAT IS TO SUBORDINATE PUBLIC INTERESTS TO THEIR PERSONAL AIMS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT THE POWER TO DO SO
19

AND MEN ARE SO THOROUGHLY PERSUADED OF IT THAT THEY GROW UP LIVE AND DIE IN THAT CONVICTION WITHOUT ONCE ENTERTAINING A DOUBT ABOUT IT
AND WE NEED ONLY EACH BEGIN TO DO WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO WE NEED ONLY EACH LIVE WITH ALL THE LIGHT THAT IS IN US TO BRING ABOUT AT ONCE THE PROMISED KINGDOM OF GOD TO WHICH EVERY MAN'S HEART IS YEARNING
AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE ADVANTAGES BESTOWED ON THESE MEN WHO ARE SELECTED FROM CONVICTS THERE IS A CONSTANTLY DIMINISHING NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS FOR THE POST
STRUCK BY THIS REFLECTION MEN OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES HAVE TRIED TO FIND MEANS FOR PREVENTING OR AT LEAST FOR SOFTENING THE RESULTS OF THE TERRIBLE SLAUGHTER WITH WHICH WE ARE THREATENED
AS TO THE SECOND QUESTION WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO SERVE IN THE ARMY WHO HAVE NOT REFUSED THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY A GOVERNMENT RESTING ON FORCE THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS IT IN DETAIL AND ARRIVES AT THE CONCLUSION THAT A CHRISTIAN FOLLOWING THE LAW OF CHRIST SINCE HE DOES NOT GO TO WAR OUGHT NOT EITHER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT COURTS OF LAW OR ELECTIONS AND THAT IN HIS PRIVATE CONCERNS HE MUST NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO THE AUTHORITIES THE POLICE OR THE LAW
THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU CHAPTER I
THEY ALL KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TORTURE PERHAPS TO KILL THEIR FAMISHING FELLOW-CREATURES AND THAT THEY MUST SET TO WORK WITHIN AN HOUR
YOU WILL SAY THAT THE WORLD IS SO MADE THAT THIS IS INEVITABLE AND THAT YOU DO NOT DO THIS OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE FORCED TO DO SO
THIS IS WHAT HAS OFTEN BEEN DONE IN RUSSIA AND IS AND MUST ALWAYS BE DONE WHERE THE SOCIAL ORDER IS BASED ON FORCE
AND EVEN THE LARGER HALF OF THE WORKING PEOPLE OPENLY DECLARE THAT THE EXISTING ORDER IS INIQUITOUS AND BOUND TO BE DESTROYED OR REFORMED
LANDOWNERS BUILD SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS ON THEIR PROPERTY AND SOME EVEN GIVE UP THE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR LAND AND TRANSFER IT TO THE CULTIVATORS OR ESTABLISH COMMUNITIES UPON IT
THIS IS THE LAST WORD OF REFINED CULTURE AND WITH IT OF THAT OVERSHADOWING OF CONSCIENCE WHICH HAS COME UPON THE EDUCATED CLASSES OF OUR TIMES
THAT IS JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE TRANSITION OF HUMANITY FROM ONE STAGE TO ANOTHER THROUGH WHICH WE ARE PASSING NOW
DO NOT UNTO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD NOT THEY SHOULD DO UNTO YOU--AS OUR DUTIES TO SELF MUST BE SUBORDINATED TO OUR DUTIES TO OTHERS SO MUST OUR DUTIES TO OTHERS BE SUBORDINATED TO OUR DUTIES TO GOD--THE ONLY WAY OUT OF OUR POSITION LIES IF NOT IN RENOUNCING OUR POSITION AND OUR PRIVILEGES AT LEAST IN RECOGNIZING OUR SIN AND NOT JUSTIFYING IT NOR DISGUISING IT--THE ONLY OBJECT OF LIFE IS TO LEARN THE TRUTH AND TO ACT ON IT--ACCEPTANCE OF THE POSITION AND OF STATE ACTION DEPRIVES LIFE OF ALL OBJECT--IT IS GOD'S WILL THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM IN OUR LIFE THAT IS THAT WE SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE GREATEST UNITY OF ALL THAT HAS LIFE A UNITY ONLY POSSIBLE IN TRUTH
AS INDEED THEY ARE
THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN PROFESSED BY A MINORITY OF MEN FROM THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY
THEY CAN'T DISOBEY THE AUTHORITIES HE SAID
STILL LESS CAN ONE CRITICISE A SUBJECT ON A HIGHER PLANE FROM A LOWER POINT OF VIEW
AND THEN ALL THE CROWD GET INTO THEIR SLEDGES AGAIN AND MOVE AWAY DOWN THE STREET TO THE TAVERNS AND POT-HOUSES AND LOUDER THAN EVER SOUNDS THE MEDLEY OF SINGING AND SOBBING DRUNKEN SHOUTS AND THE WAILING OF THE WIVES AND MOTHERS THE SOUNDS OF THE ACCORDEON AND OATHS
HE SAYS OPENLY THAT THE SOLDIERS ARE IN HIS SERVICE AT HIS DISPOSAL AND MUST BE READY FOR HIS ADVANTAGE TO MURDER EVEN THEIR BROTHERS AND FATHERS
AND THEIR SONS WILL RAISE STATUES TO THOSE WHO HAVE DONE MOST IN THEIR SLAUGHTER
HE THROWS OFF HIS PELISSE SLIPS HIS BOOTS OFF HIS FEET TAKES OFF HIS WAISTCOAT AND DRAWS HIS SHIRT OVER HIS HEAD AND NAKED TREMBLING ALL OVER AND EXHALING AN ODOR OF TOBACCO SPIRITS AND SWEAT GOES INTO THE REVISION OFFICE NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BRAWNY BARE ARMS
ONE SAYS HE WILL ONLY PAY WHEN THEY TELL HIM WHAT OBJECT THE MONEY TAKEN FROM HIM WILL BE SPENT ON
THAT WAS WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WHOM I MET WERE GOING TO DO
THE CHURCHES WHICH ORIGINATED FROM MISUNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING AND HAVE MAINTAINED THIS MISUNDERSTANDING BY THEIR IMMOVABILITY CANNOT BUT PERSECUTE AND REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE ALL TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS
BUT BESIDES BELONGING TO THE STATE AND HAVING DUTIES CREATED BY THAT POSITION YOU BELONG ALSO TO ETERNITY AND TO GOD WHO ALSO LAYS DUTIES UPON YOU
BUT EVEN HYPOCRISY HAS ITS LIMITS
OUR LIFE HAS REACHED THE EXTREME LIMIT OF MISERY AND CANNOT BE IMPROVED BY ANY SYSTEMS OF ORGANIZATION--ALL OUR LIFE AND ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE QUITE MEANINGLESS--ARE WE DOING WHAT GOD WILLS OF US BY PRESERVING OUR PRIVILEGES AND DUTIES TO GOVERNMENT?--WE ARE PUT IN THIS POSITION NOT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SO MADE AND IT IS INEVITABLE BUT BECAUSE WE WISH IT TO BE SO BECAUSE IT IS TO THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF US--OUR CONSCIENCE IS IN OPPOSITION TO OUR POSITION AND ALL OUR CONDUCT AND THE WAY OUT OF THE CONTRADICTION IS TO BE FOUND IN THE RECOGNITION OF THE CHRISTIAN TRUTH
WHEN THEY SAY THAT EXCEPT FOR THE GOVERNMENT THE BAD WOULD OPPRESS THE GOOD THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE GOOD ARE THOSE WHO AT THE PRESENT TIME ARE IN POSSESSION OF POWER AND THE BAD ARE THOSE WHO ARE IN SUBJECTION TO IT
TO ATTAIN THE SECOND OBJECT THE CONGRESS APPEALS TO GOVERNMENTS WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT THEY SHOULD DISBAND THEIR ARMIES AND REPLACE WAR BY ARBITRATION
THE CONCEPTION OF ONE CHURCH ONLY AROSE WHEN THERE WERE TWO SIDES DIVIDED AND DISPUTING WHO EACH CALLED THE OTHER SIDE HERESY AND RECOGNIZED THEIR OWN SIDE ONLY AS THE INFALLIBLE CHURCH
WHAT ARE PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT
A COMRADE OF PIOTR SIDOROV'S WHO HAS JUST BEEN PASSED FOR SERVICE AND COME NAKED OUT OF THE REVISION OFFICE IS DRESSING HURRIEDLY HIS TEETH CHATTERING
BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES ARE THE INTERMEDIARY PERSONAGES WHO SUPERINTEND THE MURDERS AND OTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ARE FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TAKEN OFF THEIR SHOULDERS PARTLY BY THEIR SUPERIORS WHO HAVE GIVEN THE ORDER PARTLY BY THE FACT THAT SUCH ORDERS ARE EXPECTED FROM THEM BY ALL WHO ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE
HEAR WHAT MONTESQUIEU WROTE IN HIS DAY
GOVERNMENTS WERE TO GIVE MEN FREEDOM FROM THE CRUELTY OF PERSONAL STRIFE AND SECURITY IN THE PERMANENCE OF THE STATE ORDER OF EXISTENCE
MAN'S FREEDOM LIES IN THE POWER OF THIS CHOICE
LET THEM CONFESS THEIR CONVICTION AND STAND UP FOR IT AND NOT IN WORDS ALONE BUT IN SUFFERINGS TOO IF NEED BE
BUT SINCE THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE WOMAN IN EACH HOUSE AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHICH ONE WAS SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT DISPUTES AND OPPOSITION AROSE
JE SAIS QUE L'ON NOUS CONTESTE LE DROIT DE QUALIFIER AINSI THAT IS TO CALL HERESIES LES TENDANCES QUI FURENT SI VIVEMENT COMBATTUES PAR LES PREMIERS PERES
ON THE ROAD THE RECRUITS HAVE BEEN DRINKING WITHOUT INTERMISSION UNCHECKED BY THE ELDERS WHO FEEL THAT GOING ON SUCH AN INSANE ERRAND ABANDONING THEIR WIVES AND MOTHERS AND RENOUNCING ALL THEY HOLD SACRED IN ORDER TO BECOME A SENSELESS INSTRUMENT OF DESTRUCTION WOULD BE TOO AGONIZING IF THEY WERE NOT STUPEFIED WITH SPIRITS
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WARS OF LATTER YEARS TEACHES US THAT EVERY WAR HAS ONLY INTENSIFIED NATIONAL HATREDS MADE MILITARY BURDENS MORE CRUSHING AND INSUPPORTABLE AND RENDERED THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL GRIEVOUS AND INSOLUBLE MODERN EUROPE KEEPS UNDER ARMS AN ACTIVE ARMY OF NINE MILLIONS OF MEN WRITES ENRICO FERRI BESIDES FIFTEEN MILLIONS OF RESERVE WITH AN OUTLAY OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF FRANCS PER ANNUM
NO OBEDIENCE TO LAWS CONSTITUTES A FULFILLMENT OF THIS DOCTRINE AND THEREFORE FOR IT THERE CAN BE NO BINDING RULES AND LAWS
THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUCH STIMULANTS AS PARADES REVIEWS RELIGIOUS SOLEMNITIES AND CORONATIONS IS HOWEVER AN ACUTE AND TEMPORARY CONDITION
FOR YOU THERE IS NOW BUT ONE ENEMY MY ENEMY
ALL THESE PRINCIPLES APPEAR TO MEN WHO REGARD THEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A LOWER CONCEPTION OF LIFE AS THE EXPRESSION OF AN IMPULSIVE ENTHUSIASM HAVING NO DIRECT APPLICATION TO LIFE
AND ONE MUST ADD NOT ONLY BRIGANDS BUT SLAVES
I ONCE TOOK PART IN MOSCOW IN A RELIGIOUS MEETING WHICH USED TO TAKE PLACE GENERALLY IN THE WEEK AFTER EASTER NEAR THE CHURCH IN THE OHOTNY ROW
THE MISTAKEN NOTION OF SCIENTIFIC MEN THAT THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY CONSISTS IN THE SUPERNATURAL AND THAT ITS MORAL TEACHING IS IMPRACTICABLE CONSTITUTES ANOTHER REASON OF THE FAILURE OF MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY TO UNDERSTAND CHRISTIANITY
THE CHAMPIONS OF GOVERNMENT ASSERT THAT WITHOUT IT THE WICKED WILL OPPRESS AND OUTRAGE THE GOOD AND THAT THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT ENABLES THE GOOD TO RESIST THE WICKED BUT IN THIS ASSERTION THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS TAKE FOR GRANTED THE PROPOSITION THEY WANT TO PROVE
EVERY ONE OF THEM WOULD BE INSULTED AT THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING OF THE KIND IN PRIVATE LIFE
BUT LOVE FOR A STATE SUCH AS TURKEY GERMANY ENGLAND AUSTRIA OR RUSSIA IS A THING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
THEY KNOW THAT THEY THEMSELVES WILL PERISH DIRECTLY THEY EVEN RELAX THE HARSHNESS OF THEIR OPPRESSION
THAT WOULD BE SUCH AN EXCELLENT THING
I AM NOT GOING TO SPEAK OF WHAT IS PREACHED AND WHAT IS WRITTEN BY CLERGY OF SCIENTIFIC OR LIBERAL TENDENCIES IN THE THEOLOGICAL JOURNALS
HE DECLINES QUOTING A PARTICULAR PASSAGE OF THE GOSPEL IN WHICH SWEARING IS FORBIDDEN
THE LAW OF LOVE WOULD ALONE BE SUFFICIENT IN EVERY CASE
IT IS HIDDEN IN DARKNESS FROM MEN AND THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE TRUE LAW OF CHRIST
AND IT IS NOT ONLY FROM THE THEORETICAL STANDPOINT THAT EVERY MAN MUST SEE THAT THE SACRIFICES DEMANDED BY THE STATE HAVE NO JUSTIFICATION
HISTORICALLY HELCHITSKY ATTRIBUTES THE DEGENERATION OF CHRISTIANITY TO THE TIMES OF CONSTANTINE THE GREAT WHOM HE POPE SYLVESTER ADMITTED INTO THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH WITH ALL HIS HEATHEN MORALS AND LIFE
WHY SHOULD I PROMISE TO OBEY THEM KNOWING THEM TO BE WICKED OR FOOLISH PEOPLE OR ELSE NOT KNOWING THEM AT ALL
ANOTHER REASON IS THE MISTAKEN NOTION THAT IT IS IMPRACTICABLE AND OUGHT TO BE REPLACED BY THE DOCTRINE OF LOVE FOR HUMANITY
A DEAD TREE STANDS APPARENTLY AS FIRMLY AS EVER--IT MAY EVEN SEEM FIRMER BECAUSE IT IS HARDER--BUT IT IS ROTTEN AT THE CORE AND SOON MUST FALL
BUT CAN IT BE THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A STRONG AVERSION TO MEN'S SUFFERINGS ILL TREATMENT AND MURDER THAT YOU HAVE SUCH AN INTENSE NEED OF LOVE AND CO-OPERATION WITH YOUR FELLOWS THAT YOU SEE CLEARLY THAT ONLY BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE EQUALITY OF ALL AND BY MUTUAL SERVICES CAN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE HAPPINESS BE REALIZED
AS A MAN I PITY HIM
THE SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION IN THEIR IDEA IS TO BE FOUND IN READING ADDRESSES WRITING BOOKS ELECTING PRESIDENTS VICE-PRESIDENTS AND SECRETARIES AND MEETING AND SPEAKING FIRST IN ONE TOWN AND THEN IN ANOTHER
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE WAR AND I ASSENT TO THIS AND SUPPORT IT AND SWEAR THAT I WILL SUPPORT IT
BUT IT IS IN DARKNESS THAT THE LIGHT BEGINS TO SHINE AND SO THE LIGHT IS RISING UPON OUR EPOCH
AND SECONDLY EXCEPT FOR THE STATE WE SHOULD BE SAVAGES AND SHOULD HAVE NEITHER RELIGION CULTURE EDUCATION NOR COMMERCE NOR MEANS OF COMMUNICATION NOR OTHER SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
BUT HE LEAVES THE READER TO DRAW FOR HIMSELF THE PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION FROM THE EXPOSITIONS IN THE WHOLE BOOK
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT THE CONDITIONS OF OUR LIFE WHICH ARISE OUT OF THIS ORGANIZATION--OUR CIVILIZATION CULTURE ART AND SCIENCE--TO REMAIN INTACT
WHO HAS MADE YOU THE NURSE IN CHARGE OF THIS SICK AND MORIBUND ORGANIZATION
THEY WILL FALL IN SOME PLAIN WITH A SABER CUT IN THE HEAD OR A BULLET THROUGH THE BREAST
WE SHUT UP THE DANGEROUS--AS WE THINK--MEMBER OF SOCIETY BUT THE NEXT DAY THIS MAN MIGHT CEASE TO BE DANGEROUS AND HIS IMPRISONMENT MIGHT BE FOR NOTHING
ARE THEY READY TO SACRIFICE MODERN CIVILIZATION THEIR MANNER OF LIFE THEIR RELIGION THE RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MORALITY
EVERYONE IF HE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS NOW WILL KNOW THAT IT IS SO AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT INSUBORDINATION OR AT A REVOLUTION OF THE EXISTING ORDER
THE MAN OF ANTIQUITY COULD BELIEVE HE HAD THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER MEN AND TO KEEP THEM IN MISERY FOR GENERATIONS SINCE HE BELIEVED THAT MEN CAME FROM DIFFERENT ORIGINS WERE BASE OR NOBLE IN BLOOD CHILDREN OF HAM OR OF JAPHET
GOVERNMENTS AND THE RULING CLASSES NO LONGER TAKE THEIR STAND ON RIGHT OR EVEN ON THE SEMBLANCE OF JUSTICE BUT ON A SKILLFUL ORGANIZATION CARRIED TO SUCH A POINT OF PERFECTION BY THE AID OF SCIENCE THAT EVERYONE IS CAUGHT IN THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE AND HAS NO CHANCE OF ESCAPING FROM IT
IN THIS WAY IF ALL KEPT THE ORDINANCE OF NON-RESISTANCE THERE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE NO EVIL NOR CRIME
MEANTIME THE CROWD OF FATHERS MOTHERS AND WIVES IS STANDING AT THE DOORS WAITING
THIS TRANSFERENCE IS ACCOMPLISHED EASILY AND NATURALLY IN ITS EARLIEST FORMS IN THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE FAMILY AND THE CLAN
THE WHOLE OF HISTORY FROM THE TIME OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AND THE APPEARANCE OF CHRISTIANITY IS THE HISTORY OF THE TRANSITION THROUGH WHICH WE ARE STILL PASSING NOW FROM THE SOCIAL VIEW OF LIFE TO THE DIVINE VIEW OF LIFE
THE RUSSIAN ADVANCED CRITICS OBVIOUSLY UNAWARE OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO ELUCIDATE THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE AND SOMETIMES EVEN IMAGINING APPARENTLY THAT THE RULE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL HAD BEEN INVENTED BY ME PERSONALLY FELL FOUL OF THE VERY IDEA OF IT
HERZEN'S PROPHECY OF THE MODERN GHENGHIS KHAN WITH HIS TELEGRAMS IS COMPLETELY REALIZED BY THIS GOVERNOR
THE EMPEROR ENGAGES THEM AND THEY BEGIN TO SEW AT THEM BUT THEY EXPLAIN THAT THE CLOTHES HAVE THE EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY OF REMAINING INVISIBLE TO ANYONE WHO IS UNFIT FOR HIS POSITION
THESE MEN HAD BEEN SENT FOR SOLDIERS BUT THEY WOULD NOT SERVE
HOW GREAT THE IGNORANCE IS OF EVERYTHING RELATING TO THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FACT THAT GARRISON THE SON WHO HAS WRITTEN AN EXCELLENT BIOGRAPHY OF HIS FATHER IN FOUR GREAT VOLUMES IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRY WHETHER THERE ARE EXISTING NOW SOCIETIES FOR NON-RESISTANCE AND ADHERENTS OF THE DOCTRINE TOLD ME THAT AS FAR AS HE KNEW THAT SOCIETY HAD BROKEN UP AND THAT THERE WERE NO ADHERENTS OF THAT DOCTRINE WHILE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN HE WAS WRITING TO ME THERE WAS LIVING AT HOPEDALE IN MASSACHUSETTS ADIN BALLOU WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THE LABORS OF GARRISON THE FATHER AND HAD DEVOTED FIFTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO ADVOCATING BOTH ORALLY AND IN PRINT THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE
AND YET WE NEED ONLY IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT WILL REALLY INEVITABLY COME TO PASS THAT IS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIAL STANDARD REPLACING THE HEATHEN SOCIAL STANDARD AND ESTABLISHED WITH THE SAME POWER AND UNIVERSALITY AND THE MAJORITY OF MEN AS MUCH ASHAMED OF TAKING ANY PART IN VIOLENCE OR IN PROFITING BY IT AS THEY ARE TO-DAY OF THIEVING SWINDLING BEGGING AND COWARDICE
THIS DOCTRINE FORBIDS DOING THAT WHEREBY EVIL HAS ENDURED FOR AGES AND MULTIPLIED IN THE WORLD
IT IS A GOOD THING FURTHER TO READ ALOUD A CERTAIN BOOK OVER THE DEAD BODY AND TO PRONOUNCE THE DEAD MAN'S NAME IN CHURCH AT A CERTAIN TIME
THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THESE MEN WHO SERVED THE CHURCHES WAS THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THE MEN AND NOT OF THE INSTITUTION THEY SERVED
THE LUXURIOUS EXPENDITURE OF A SINGLE RESPECTABLE AND SO-CALLED HONORABLE FAMILY EVEN WITHIN THE CONVENTIONAL LIMITS CONSUMING AS IT DOES THE PRODUCE OF AS MANY DAYS OF LABOR AS WOULD SUFFICE TO PROVIDE FOR THOUSANDS LIVING IN PRIVATION NEAR DOES MORE TO PERVERT MEN'S MINDS THAN THOUSANDS OF THE VIOLENT ORGIES OF COARSE TRADESPEOPLE OFFICERS AND WORKMEN OF DRUNKEN AND DEBAUCHED HABITS WHO SMASH UP GLASSES AND CROCKERY FOR AMUSEMENT
AND THIS WAS THE FACT
AND IF HE SPENDS A THOUSANDTH PART OF HIS STOLEN WEALTH ON SOME PUBLIC INSTITUTION A HOSPITAL OR MUSEUM OR SCHOOL THEN HE IS EVEN REGARDED AS THE BENEFACTOR OF THE PEOPLE ON THE EXPLOITATION AND CORRUPTION OF WHOM HIS WHOLE PROSPERITY HAS BEEN FOUNDED
ABOVE ALL EVEN IF YOU ALLOW THAT THIS ORGANIZATION IS NECESSARY WHY DO YOU BELIEVE IT TO BE YOUR DUTY TO MAINTAIN IT AT THE COST OF YOUR BEST FEELINGS
IT IS CLEAR NOW FROM THE VERY SIMPLEST MOST COMMONPLACE POINT OF VIEW THAT IT IS MADNESS TO REMAIN UNDER THE ROOF OF A BUILDING WHICH CANNOT SUPPORT ITS WEIGHT AND THAT WE MUST LEAVE IT
AND THEY ASSURE PEOPLE THAT THEY ONLY RULE IN THE NAME OF GOOD SENSE AND BENEVOLENCE
THE AUTHORITY WHO DECIDED WHAT OUGHT TO BE REGARDED AS EVIL AND RESISTED BY FORCE WAS AT ONE TIME THE POPE AT ANOTHER AN EMPEROR OR KING AN ELECTIVE ASSEMBLY OR A WHOLE NATION
IN REALITY IT IS NOT SO AND CAN NEVER BE SO
DURING MY LIFE I HAVE HEARD A GREAT MANY GOOD PEOPLE PROTEST AGAINST THIS FRIGHTFUL CUSTOM OF INTERNATIONAL BUTCHERY WHICH ALL ADMIT AND DEPLORE
THOSE WHO DO NOT ABSORB IT CONSCIOUSLY ABSORB IT UNCONSCIOUSLY
THE CONGRESS EXPRESSES ITS SATISFACTION AT THE ADOPTION BY THE SPANISH SENATE ON JUNE 16 LAST OF A PROJECT OF LAW AUTHORIZING THE GOVERNMENT TO NEGOTIATE GENERAL OR SPECIAL TREATIES OF ARBITRATION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF ALL DISPUTES EXCEPT THOSE RELATING TO THE INDEPENDENCE OR INTERNAL GOVERNMENT OF THE STATES AFFECTED
THE LABORER OF THE PRESENT DAY WOULD NOT CEASE TO SUFFER EVEN IF HIS TOIL WERE MUCH LIGHTER THAN THAT OF THE SLAVE OF ANCIENT TIMES EVEN IF HE GAINED AN EIGHT-HOUR WORKING DAY AND A WAGE OF THREE DOLLARS A DAY
A MAN MARRIES AND IS DIVORCED EDUCATES HIS CHILDREN AND EVEN IN MANY COUNTRIES PROFESSES HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
I CONGRATULATE YOU ON SERVING THE TZAR AND THEY POOR FELLOWS SOMEONE HAS GIVEN THEM A HINT BEFOREHAND MUTTER AWKWARDLY THEIR VOICES THICK WITH DRINK SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY ARE GLAD
THE ONLY GUIDE FOR THE CHRISTIAN'S ACTIONS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DIVINE PRINCIPLE LIVING WITHIN HIM WHICH CANNOT BE CHECKED OR GOVERNED BY ANYTHING
BUT IS THIS INTERPRETATION OF CHRIST A TRUE ONE HE SAYS
I REMEMBER ONCE BEING PRESENT IN THE MONKS BOOKSHOP OF THE OPTCHY HERMITAGE WHILE AN OLD PEASANT WAS CHOOSING BOOKS FOR HIS GRANDSON WHO COULD READ
YET THE FACT THAT THE FREEDOM OF ALL MEN WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT ONLY THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONS BECOMES MORE AND MORE CLEAR AS TIME GOES ON
THERE ARE ALWAYS UNSEEN TRUTHS NOT YET REVEALED TO THE MAN'S INTELLECTUAL VISION AND THERE ARE OTHER TRUTHS OUTLIVED FORGOTTEN AND ASSIMILATED BY HIM AND THERE ARE ALSO CERTAIN TRUTHS THAT RISE UP BEFORE THE LIGHT OF HIS REASON AND REQUIRE HIS RECOGNITION
THUS I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT IN SERVIA MEN OF THE SO-CALLED SECT OF NAZARENES STEADILY REFUSE TO SERVE IN THE ARMY AND THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING ON A FRUITLESS CONTEST WITH THEM FOR YEARS PUNISHING THEM WITH IMPRISONMENT
A MAN CANNOT GET RID OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS OWN ACTIONS
EITHER CHRISTIANITY IS A FAILURE OR THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO EXPOUND IT HAVE FAILED IN DOING SO
MEN WENT FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AND REALIZED IT MORE AND MORE IN LIFE
THUS THOSE WHO COMMANDED THE RECENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN NIJNI-NOVGOROD SARATOV OREL AND THE YUZOVSKY FACTORY REALIZED THEIR SIGNIFICANCE ONLY AFTER THEIR PERPETRATION AND NOW THOSE WHO COMMANDED AND THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THESE CRIMES ARE ASHAMED BEFORE PUBLIC OPINION AND THEIR CONSCIENCE
THAT IT IS YOUR DUTY TO SERVE THEM AND AS LANDOWNER JUDGE EMPEROR OR SOLDIER TO CONFORM TO THEIR LAWS
THERE ARE SOME WHICH POINT OUT ITS IMMORALITY
NOR CAN IT BE PROVED AS THE OPPONENTS OF GOVERNMENT MAINTAIN THAT MEN HAVE ALREADY BECOME SO WISE AND GOOD THAT THEY WILL NOT SPOIL OR MURDER ONE ANOTHER BUT WILL PREFER PEACEFUL ASSOCIATIONS TO HOSTILITIES
NOTHING HINDERS THE EMANCIPATION OF MEN FROM SLAVERY SO MUCH AS THIS AMAZING ERROR
THEY ARE BOUND TO TAKE UP THIS ATTITUDE BY THE CONTRADICTORY POSITION IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES BETWEEN BELIEF IN THE DIVINITY OF THEIR MASTER AND DISBELIEF IN HIS CLEAREST UTTERANCES AND THEY WANT TO ESCAPE FROM THIS CONTRADICTION
AND THE GENDARMES THOUGH THEY ARE BOUND BY NO HARD-AND-FAST RULES STILL FIND NO GROUND FOR A CRIMINAL CHARGE IN THE YOUNG MAN AND LIKE THE CLERGY THEY SEND HIM BACK TO THE ARMY
IF WE INCLUDE ALL MEN WITHOUT EXCEPTION WHY SHOULD WE NOT INCLUDE ALSO THE HIGHER ANIMALS MANY OF WHOM ARE SUPERIOR TO THE LOWEST SPECIMENS OF THE HUMAN RACE
THE GREATER NUMBER OF GARRISON'S FELLOW-WORKERS IN THE MOVEMENT FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE SLAVES FEARING THAT THE TOO RADICAL PROGRAMME OF THE JOURNAL THE NON-RESISTANT MIGHT KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRACTICAL WORK OF NEGRO-EMANCIPATION GAVE UP THE PROFESSION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-RESISTANCE AS IT HAD BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE DECLARATION AND BOTH SOCIETY AND JOURNAL CEASED TO EXIST
BUT MEN THINK THAT TO SET ALL MEN FREE BY THIS MEANS IS TOO SLOW A PROCESS THAT THEY MUST FIND SOME OTHER MEANS BY WHICH THEY COULD SET ALL MEN FREE AT ONCE
AND ONCE AGAIN I WAS AMAZED THAT THIS HIDEOUS CRIME CAN BE PERPETRATED SO EASILY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE TOWN
THEIR NUMBER WILL ONLY BE DIMINISHED BY THE CHANGE OF THE MORAL STANDARD OF SOCIETY
THOSE WHO DO THE EVIL HAVE NOT HAD TIME YET TO LEARN HOW TO ACT OTHERWISE THOUGH THEY DO NOT WANT TO ACT AS THEY DO
ARE YOU DOING HIS WILL WHEN AS LANDOWNER OR MANUFACTURER YOU ROB THE POOR OF THE FRUITS OF THEIR TOIL BASING YOUR LIFE ON THIS PLUNDER OF THE WORKERS OR WHEN AS JUDGE OR GOVERNOR YOU ILL TREAT MEN SENTENCE THEM TO EXECUTION OR WHEN AS SOLDIERS YOU PREPARE FOR WAR KILL AND PLUNDER
WE DO NOT NOTICE IT JUST AS WE DO NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH BECAUSE WE ARE MOVED TOGETHER WITH EVERYTHING AROUND US
IN THE INTRODUCTION THE AUTHOR PROPOUNDS A SERIES OF QUESTIONS
JANUARY 1894 PREFACE
A CHRISTIAN CANNOT FAIL TO BE FREE BECAUSE THE ATTAINMENT OF THE AIM HE SETS BEFORE HIMSELF CANNOT BE PREVENTED OR EVEN HINDERED BY ANYONE OR ANYTHING
DIE WAHRE KIRCHE WIRD DAREIN ERKANNT DASS IN IHR DAS WORT GOTTES LAUTER UND REIN OHNE MENSCHENZUSATZE GELEHRT AND DIE SACRAMENTE TREU NACH CHRISTI EINSETZUNG GEWAHRET WERDEN FOOTNOTE
CONSEQUENTLY THEY WRITE FROM PETERSBURG THAT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN MUST BE OUT OF HIS MIND THEY MUST NOT USE ANY SEVERE TREATMENT WITH HIM BUT MUST SEND HIM TO A LUNATIC ASYLUM THAT HIS MENTAL CONDITION MAY BE INQUIRED INTO AND BE SCIENTIFICALLY TREATED
THUS ONE FEELS CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF AN IMMENSE DISCOURAGEMENT
THE BREACH OF THE COMMAND OF NON-RESISTANCE TO BE REGARDED SIMPLY AS A WEAKNESS--5TH REPLY
ARTICLE 88
G
4 OF THE METHOD OF MAKING HERETICS
IF A MAN BEFORE HE PASSED FROM ONE STAGE TO ANOTHER COULD KNOW HIS FUTURE LIFE IN FULL DETAIL HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE FOR
ALL THE DEEDS OF VIOLENCE OF TYRANTS FROM NAPOLEON TO THE LOWEST COMMANDER OF A COMPANY WHO FIRES UPON A CROWD CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE INTOXICATING EFFECT OF THEIR ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THESE SLAVES
HELCHITSKY DENIES COMPLETELY THE RIGHT TO MAKE WAR AND TO INFLICT THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR THE JEW THE GREEK AND THE ROMAN TO DEFEND THE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS NATION BY MURDER
THE MAN WHO FOR THE SAKE OF HIS OWN ANIMAL PERSONALITY LOVES HIS FAMILY KNOWS WHOM HE LOVES
THE REMAINDER OF MANKIND WHO ACCEPTED ON TRUST THE PRECEDING TRUTH ON WHICH THE EXISTING ORDER IS BASED ARE ALWAYS OPPOSED TO THE DIFFUSION OF THE NEW TRUTH
IT IS HURTFUL TO ME AND FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW IT IS IMMORAL BASE AND VILE
THE POLICE AUTHORITIES AND GENDARMES CROSS-QUESTION HIM BUT NOTHING THAT HE SAYS CAN BE BROUGHT UNDER THE HEAD OF ANY OF THE MISDEMEANORS WHICH COME UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION
CHRISTIANITY IS UNDERSTOOD NOW BY ALL WHO PROFESS THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AS A SUPERNATURAL MIRACULOUS REVELATION OF EVERYTHING WHICH IS REPEATED IN THE CREED
THE WORK OF GARRISON THE FATHER IN HIS FOUNDATION OF THE SOCIETY OF NON-RESISTANTS AND HIS DECLARATION EVEN MORE THAN MY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE QUAKERS CONVINCED ME OF THE FACT THAT THE DEPARTURE OF THE RULING FORM OF CHRISTIANITY FROM THE LAW OF CHRIST ON NON-RESISTANCE BY FORCE IS AN ERROR THAT HAS LONG BEEN OBSERVED AND POINTED OUT AND THAT MEN HAVE LABORED AND ARE STILL LABORING TO CORRECT
BUT WE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NOW
55 THUS WROTE ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO THE RUSSIAN WRITER WHO WITH PROPHETIC INSIGHT SAW CLEARLY THEN WHAT EVEN THE MOST UNREFLECTING MAN SEES TO-DAY THE IMPOSSIBILITY THAT IS OF LIFE CONTINUING ON ITS OLD BASIS AND THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING NEW FORMS OF LIFE
MANY OF THEM WOULD NOT KILL OR HURT AN ANIMAL
BUT ONE OUGHT RATHER TO BE SURPRISED THAT THERE ARE SO FEW
WHICH OF YOU BY TAKING THOUGHT CAN ADD ONE CUBIT ONTO HIS STATURE
HERE WEARING A CROSS ON HIS BREAST NEAR THEM IS PROSPEROUS-LOOKING OLD PRIEST IN A SILKEN CASSOCK WITH LONG GRAY HAIR FLOWING ON TO HIS COPE
AND SO WE SEE THE MERCHANT WHO OFTEN GOES FURTHER AND COMMITS ACTS OF DIRECT DISHONESTY SELLING ADULTERATED GOODS USING FALSE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES AND TRADING IN PRODUCTS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND OPIUM BOLDLY REGARDING HIMSELF AND BEING REGARDED BY OTHERS SO LONG AS HE DOES NOT DIRECTLY DECEIVE HIS COLLEAGUES IN BUSINESS AS A PATTERN OF PROBITY AND VIRTUE
AS THOUGH THE FATHER OF A FAMILY KNOWING HOW HE OUGHT TO BEHAVE AT HIS AGE SHOULD YET CONTINUE THROUGH HABIT AND THOUGHTLESSNESS TO LIVE IN THE SAME CHILDISH WAY AS HE DID IN BOYHOOD
EVERY SO-CALLED HERESY REGARDING AS IT DOES ITS OWN CREED AS THE TRUTH CAN JUST AS EASILY FIND IN CHURCH HISTORY A SERIES OF ILLUSTRATIONS OF ITS OWN CREED CAN USE ALL PRESSENSE'S ARGUMENTS ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND CAN CALL ITS OWN CREED THE ONE TRULY CHRISTIAN CREED
FOR EVERY ADVOCACY OF A TRUTH INCONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING ORDER BY AN INDIVIDUAL IS THEY MAINTAIN NOT ONLY USELESS BUT INJURIOUS SINCE IN PROVOKES COERCIVE MEASURES ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORITIES RESTRICTING THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM CONTINUING ANY ACTION USEFUL TO SOCIETY
THIS IS ALSO THE VIEW OF SOME CIVILIANS SO-CALLED EDUCATED AND CULTIVATED PEOPLE
THUS THEY RETURN TO A RANK OF SOCIETY LOWER IN POSITION BUT HIGHER IN MORALITY RAISING THEREBY THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF CHRISTIAN CONSCIOUSNESS IN MEN
THE WORD CHURCH IS USED TWICE IN THE GOSPELS--ONCE IN THE SENSE OF AN ASSEMBLY OF MEN TO DECIDE A DISPUTE THE OTHER TIME IN CONNECTION WITH THE OBSCURE UTTERANCE ABOUT A STONE--PETER AND THE GATES OF HELL
THEIR REFUTATIONS OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL DOCTRINE OF CHRIST WERE ALL THE MORE SUCCESSFUL SINCE THEY KNEW BEFOREHAND THAT THEIR ARGUMENTS COULD NOT BE CONTESTED OR CORRECTED FOR THE CENSORSHIP NOT HAVING PASSED THE BOOK DID NOT PASS ARTICLES IN ITS DEFENSE
AND WHETHER IT IS LAUDABLE AND WORTHY OF A MAN AND A CHRISTIAN TO PREACH FOR A SALARY TO THE PEOPLE NOT CHRISTIANITY BUT SUPERSTITIONS WHICH ONE KNOWS TO BE STUPID AND PERNICIOUS
A YOUNG MAN OF FAIR EDUCATION REFUSES IN THE MOSCOW TOWNHALL TO TAKE THE OATH
YOU ASK ME MY VIEW AS TO THE POSSIBLE SUCCESS OF THE UNIVERSAL CONGRESS OF PEACE
ANIMAL FORCE OF MAN CHRIST ADDS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A DIVINE FORCE--CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO DESTROY POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ONLY WHEN THE IDEAL HELD UP IS MISTAKEN FOR RULE--IDEAL MUST NOT BE LOWERED--LIFE ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S TEACHING IS MOVEMENT--THE IDEAL AND THE PRECEPTS--SECOND MISCONCEPTION SHOWN IN REPLACING LOVE AND SERVICE OF GOD BY LOVE AND SERVICE OF HUMANITY--MEN OF SCIENCE IMAGINE THEIR DOCTRINE OF SERVICE OF HUMANITY AND CHRISTIANITY ARE IDENTICAL--DOCTRINE OF SERVICE OF HUMANITY BASED ON SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE--LOVE FOR HUMANITY LOGICALLY DEDUCED FROM LOVE OF SELF HAS NO MEANING BECAUSE HUMANITY IS A FICTION--CHRISTIAN LOVE DEDUCED FROM LOVE OF GOD FINDS ITS OBJECT IN THE WHOLE WORLD NOT IN HUMANITY ALONE--CHRISTIANITY TEACHES MAN TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS DIVINE NATURE--IT SHOWS THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE SOUL OF MAN IS LOVE AND THAT HIS HAPPINESS ENSUES FROM LOVE OF GOD WHOM HE RECOGNIZES AS LOVE WITHIN HIMSELF
WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO GO ON EATING OUR DINNER TO FINISH SEEING THE NEW PLAY OR TO ENJOY TO THE END THE BALL THE CHRISTMAS FETE THE PROMENADE THE RACES OR THE HUNT THANKS TO THE POLICEMAN'S REVOLVER OR THE SOLDIER'S RIFLE WHICH WILL SHOOT DOWN THE FAMISHED OUTCAST WHO HAS BEEN ROBBED OF HIS SHARE AND WHO LOOKS ROUND THE CORNER WITH COVETOUS EYES AT OUR PLEASURES READY TO INTERRUPT THEM INSTANTLY WERE NOT THE POLICEMAN AND THE SOLDIER THERE PREPARED TO RUN UP AT OUR FIRST CALL FOR HELP
WE ARE ALL BROTHERS YET I TAKE A SALARY FOR BEING READY TO COMMIT MURDER FOR TEACHING MEN TO MURDER OR MAKING FIREARMS GUNPOWDER OR FORTIFICATIONS
ONE NEED ONLY COMPARE THE PRACTICE OF LIFE WITH THE THEORY OF IT TO BE DISMAYED AT THE GLARING ANTAGONISM BETWEEN OUR CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND OUR CONSCIENCE
IF THE CATHOLICS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST AT THE TIME OF THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCH INTO ARIAN AND GREEK LEFT THE CHURCH THAT FELL AWAY AND REMAINED IN THE ONE TRUE CHURCH WITH PRECISELY THE SAME RIGHT THE PROTESTANTS OF EVERY DENOMINATION CAN ASSERT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE SEPARATION OF THEIR CHURCH FROM THE CATHOLIC THE HOLY GHOST LEFT THE CATHOLIC AND PASSED INTO THE CHURCH THEY PROFESSED
BARTLETT SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS
CHAPTER IV
IF ALL WE HAD TO DREAD WERE THE REVOLUTION WHICH IS HELD UP AS A SPECTER TO TERRIFY US
IF A NATION WHICH SUBJUGATED ANOTHER WAS ON A LOWER LEVEL OF CIVILIZATION IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED THAT IT SUCCEEDED IN INTRODUCING ITS ORGANIZATION OF LIFE BY VIOLENCE
IN RUSSIA AND TURKEY AS IN AMERICA AND FRANCE HOWEVER OFTEN THE GOVERNMENT CHANGE ITS OFFICIALS THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE SELF-SEEKING AND CORRUPT OF SO LOW A MORAL STANDARD THAT THEY DO NOT EVEN COME UP THE ELEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS OF COMMON HONESTY EXPECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU RUIN THOUSANDS OF MEN IN PRISONS FORTRESSES GALLEYS AND EXILE BREAK UP MILLIONS OF FAMILIES AND RUIN MILLIONS OF MEN PHYSICALLY AS WELL AS MORALLY IN THE ARMY THAT FACT IS NOT AN IMAGINARY BUT A REAL ACT OF VIOLENCE WHICH ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN ARGUMENT ONE OUGHT TO OPPOSE BY VIOLENCE
YET YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER FEEDETH THEM
AND THIS KNOWLEDGE INCREASES THEIR SUFFERINGS AND CONSTITUTES ITS BITTEREST STING
BUT THE SAME DAY OR THE NEXT THEY WILL LAY A SCHEME FOR THE INCREASE OF THE ARMAMENT BEFORE THEIR LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY SAYING THAT THESE ARE THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES THEY TAKE FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF SECURING PEACE
THIS FREEDOM CONFINED BETWEEN THE LIMITS OF COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF THE TRUTH AND A RECOGNITION OF A PART OF THE TRUTH SEEMS HARDLY FREEDOM AT ALL ESPECIALLY SINCE WHETHER A MAN IS WILLING OR UNWILLING TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH REVEALED TO HIM HE WILL BE INEVITABLY FORCED TO CARRY IT OUT IN LIFE
DOCTOR MAY I TROUBLE YOU TO MEASURE HIM
WHY DO MOTHERS BUY THEIR CHILDREN TOY HELMETS GUNS AND SWORDS AS PLAYTHINGS
THERE ARE TRUTHS WHICH HE HAS RECOGNIZED LONG BEFORE OR WHICH HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO HIM BY EDUCATION AND TRADITION AND ACCEPTED BY HIM ON FAITH AND TO FOLLOW THESE TRUTHS HAS BECOME A HABIT A SECOND NATURE WITH HIM
THE CONSCIENCE IS THERE BUT IT HAS BEEN PUT TO SLEEP--IN THOSE IN COMMAND BY WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL AUTO-SUGGESTION
IF EVERY BEE WHO COULD FLY DID NOT TRY TO FLY THE OTHERS TOO WOULD NEVER BE STIRRED AND THE SWARM WOULD NEVER CHANGE ITS POSITION
THE FATHERS SAY LITTLE
MONEY LAVISHED BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DISCIPLINED TROOPS WEAPONS OF ASTOUNDING DESTRUCTIVE POWER ALL ORGANIZATIONS CARRIED TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF PERFECTION A WHOLE ARMY OF MEN CHARGED WITH THE TASK OF DELUDING AND HYPNOTIZING THE PEOPLE AND ALL THIS BY MEANS OF ELECTRICITY WHICH ANNIHILATES DISTANCE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF MEN WHO REGARD SUCH AN ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY NOT ONLY AS NECESSARY FOR PROFIT BUT EVEN FOR SELF-PRESERVATION AND THEREFORE EXERT EVERY EFFORT OF THEIR INGENUITY TO PRESERVE IT--WHAT AN INVINCIBLE POWER IT WOULD SEEM
THIS WILL GUARANTEE HIS WELFARE IN THE FUTURE LIFE
IT IS USELESS TO REFRAIN FROM ALL THAT
WHOSO SHEDDETH MAN'S BLOOD BY MAN SHALL HIS BLOOD BE SHED."--GEN
THAT WILL NOT DO FOR HIM ANSWERED THE MONK
DOES IT YET EXIST
PEOPLE OFTEN THINK THE QUESTION OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE IS A THEORETICAL ONE WHICH CAN BE NEGLECTED
ONE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS PROCESSION ONE SERVICE ONE SERMON FROM THE ALTAR-STEPS OR THE PULPIT IN WHICH THE PREACHER DOES NOT BELIEVE PRODUCES INCOMPARABLY MORE EVIL THAN THOUSANDS OF SWINDLING TRICKS ADULTERATION OF FOOD AND SO ON
INTIMIDATION CORRUPTION AND HYPNOTIZING BRING PEOPLE INTO A CONDITION IN WHICH THEY ARE WILLING TO BE SOLDIERS
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS NOWHERE IN EUROPE A GOVERNMENT SO DESPOTIC AND SO CLOSELY ALLIED WITH THE RULING CHURCH
SO MUCH FOR ONE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENTIFIC MEN IN RELATION TO THE IMPORT AND AIM OF CHRIST'S TEACHING
THE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY OR TRIBE UNITED INTO ONE COMMUNITY ARE LESS HOSTILE AMONG THEMSELVES AND FAMILIES AND TRIBES DO NOT DIE LIKE ONE MAN BUT HAVE A CONTINUITY OF EXISTENCE
A VIRTUE CANNOT BE PRACTICED IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SELF-SACRIFICE PRIVATION SUFFERING AND IN EXTREME CASES LOSS OF LIFE ITSELF
3-28 BUT OF THAT DAY AND HOUR KNOWETH NO MAN BUT THE FATHER ONLY MATT
THOSE WHO REFUSE TO TAKE THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE REFUSE BECAUSE TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITIES THAT IS TO MEN WHO ARE GIVEN TO DEEDS OF VIOLENCE IS CONTRARY TO THE SENSE OF CHRIST'S TEACHING
THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT OF HUMANITY DOES NOT PROCEED FROM THE BETTER ELEMENTS IN SOCIETY SEIZING POWER AND MAKING THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THEM BETTER BY FORCIBLE MEANS AS BOTH CONSERVATIVES AND REVOLUTIONISTS IMAGINE
AND THESE CONDITIONS WITHOUT STRIVING AGAINST THEM BY FORCE HE PATIENTLY ENDURES LIKE SICKNESS HUNGER AND EVERY OTHER HARDSHIP BUT THEY CANNOT SERVE HIM AS A GUIDE FOR HIS ACTIONS
HE OUGHT NOT VOLUNTARILY TO PAY TAXES BUT HE OUGHT NOT TO RESIST THE COLLECTING OF TAXES
AND IF A MAN CAUSE A BLEMISH IN HIS NEIGHBOR AS HE HATH DONE SO SHALL IT BE DONE UNTO HIM
AND ALL THESE UNHAPPY DEFENSELESS AND DELUDED LADS REPEAT AFTER HIM THE LIE WHICH HE UTTERS WITH THE ASSURANCE OF FAMILIARITY
I THINK IF IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A BOY TO LOVE HIS ENEMY IT IS GOOD FOR A GROWN-UP MAN THERE ARE IN EUROPE TWENTY-EIGHT MILLIONS OF MEN UNDER ARMS SAYS WILSON TO DECIDE DISPUTES NOT BY DISCUSSION BUT BY MURDERING ONE ANOTHER
THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH CASES IN SWEDEN AND THE MEN WHO REFUSED OBEDIENCE WERE SENT TO PRISON IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND THE GOVERNMENT STUDIOUSLY CONCEALED THESE CASES FROM THE PEOPLE
IF EVERYONE WOULD STAND OUT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING BUT BY MYSELF I SHALL ONLY SUFFER WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD TO ANYONE AND THAT IS TRUE
WHATEVER THE CONSCIOUS MAN DOES HE ACTS JUST AS HE DOES AND NOT OTHERWISE ONLY BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THAT TO ACT AS HE IS ACTING IS IN ACCORD WITH THE TRUTH OR BECAUSE HE HAS RECOGNIZED IT AT SOME PREVIOUS TIME AND IS NOW ONLY THROUGH INERTIA THROUGH HABIT ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS PREVIOUS RECOGNITION OF TRUTH
MILLOWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS BUILD HOSPITALS SCHOOLS SAVINGS BANKS ASYLUMS AND DWELLINGS FOR THEIR WORKPEOPLE
THE STATE IS SO ORGANIZED THAT WHEREVER A MAN IS PLACED IN THE SOCIAL SCALE HIS IRRESPONSIBILITY IS THE SAME
THE MEN WHO WILL DRAG US TO THE LAW COURT TO PRISON AND TO EXECUTION ARE NOT TZARS OR OFFICIALS WITH PENS IN THEIR HANDS BUT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE ARE
IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS A THEORY OF MATHEMATICS ADMITTING THAT TWO IS EQUAL TO THREE
A MAN OF THE MODERN WORLD WHO PROFITS BY THE ORDER OF THINGS BASED ON VIOLENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME PROTESTS THAT HE LOVES HIS NEIGHBOR AND DOES NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE IS DOING IN HIS DAILY LIFE TO HIS NEIGHBOR IS LIKE A BRIGAND WHO HAS SPENT HIS LIFE IN ROBBING MEN AND WHO CAUGHT AT LAST KNIFE IN HAND IN THE VERY ACT OF STRIKING HIS SHRIEKING VICTIM SHOULD DECLARE THAT HE HAD NO IDEA THAT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS DISAGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE HAD ROBBED AND WAS PREPARED TO MURDER
THEN THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES THAT IF THEY DO NOT SUBMIT AND DISPERSE HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO FORCE
AUTHORITY IN THE SENSE IN WHICH THE WORD IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD IS A MEANS OF FORCING A MAN TO ACT IN OPPOSITION TO HIS DESIRES
BUT THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF PEACE WE WANT
WE ARE STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE MURDEROUS WAR OF SOCIAL REVOLUTION TERRIFIC IN ITS MISERIES BESIDE WHICH AS THOSE WHO ARE PREPARING IT TELL US THE HORRORS OF 1793 WILL BE CHILD'S PLAY
A BENCH WAS BROUGHT AS WELL AS THE RODS AND THEN THE EXECUTIONERS WERE SUMMONED THE LATTER HAD BEEN SELECTED BEFOREHAND FROM SOME HORSESTEALERS OF THE SAME VILLAGE AS THE SOLDIERS REFUSED THE OFFICE WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY THE GOVERNOR ORDERED THE FIRST OF THE TWELVE CULPRITS POINTED OUT BY THE LANDOWNER AS THE MOST GUILTY TO COME FORWARD
ENTERING MONASTERIES TOO AND KISSING RELICS AND MIRACULOUS IKONS ARE FURTHER MEANS OF SALVATION FOR THE SOUL
PRINCIPLES AT ALL
THE DESTINY OF A WHOLE GENERATION DEPENDS ON THE HOUR IN WHICH SOME ILL-FATED POLITICIAN MAY GIVE THE SIGNAL THAT WILL BE FOLLOWED
EVERYONE IN OUR CHRISTIAN SOCIETY KNOWS EITHER BY TRADITION OR BY REVELATION OR BY THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE THAT MURDER IS ONE OF THE MOST FEARFUL CRIMES A MAN CAN COMMIT AS THE GOSPEL TELLS US AND THAT THE SIN OF MURDER CANNOT BE LIMITED TO CERTAIN PERSONS THAT IS MURDER CANNOT BE A SIN FOR SOME AND NOT A SIN FOR OTHERS
HOW CAN CHILDREN YOUTHS AND PEOPLE GENERALLY BE TAUGHT ANY KIND OF MORALITY--NOT TO SPEAK OF TEACHING IN THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTIANITY--SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DOCTRINE THAT MURDER IS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC WEAL AND THEREFORE LEGITIMATE AND THAT THERE ARE MEN OF WHOM EACH OF US MAY HAVE TO BE ONE WHOSE DUTY IS TO MURDER AND TORTURE AND COMMIT ALL SORTS OF CRIMES AT THE WILL OF THOSE WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF AUTHORITY
HE HIMSELF DOES NOTHING REALLY HE MERELY SEEMS TO BE DOING SOMETHING
I LEFT SUCH MISSPELLINGS AS IS
THEY SUMMON IRAN PETROFF
WE KNOW WITHOUT YOUR HELP WHAT IS OPPOSED TO THE LAW AND WHAT'S NOT
39
THEY MUST START OFF AND FIND THEMSELVES A HABITATION
IT MUST BE REFUTED BY THOSE WHO DISAPPROVE OF ITS TEACHING IF THEY DO NOT WANT IT TO HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE
ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE HITHERTO WITH THAT NOBLE OBJECT HAS NEVER BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE OF USE
ALL CIVIL OUTBREAKS FOR DYNASTIC OR OTHER PARTY REASONS ALL THE EXECUTIONS THAT FOLLOW ON SUCH DISTURBANCES ALL REPRESSION OF INSURRECTIONS AND MILITARY INTERVENTION TO BREAK UP MEETINGS AND TO SUPPRESS STRIKES ALL FORCED EXTORTION OF TAXES ALL THE INIQUITOUS DISTRIBUTIONS OF LAND ALL THE RESTRICTIONS ON LABOR--ARE EITHER CARRIED OUT DIRECTLY BY THE MILITARY OR BY THE POLICE WITH THE ARMY AT THEIR BACK
A RESOLUTION OF THANKS TO THE PRESIDENTS OF THE VARIOUS SITTINGS OF THE CONGRESS
ALIKE--THE POLITICAL CONTRADICTION AND THE SUFFERINGS INDUCED BY OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE--THE INTERNATIONAL CONTRADICTION AND THE RECOGNITION OF IT BY CONTEMPORARIES
BUT THIS UNDERSTANDING WILL BE THE END OF THE CHURCHES AND ALL THEIR INFLUENCE
WHAT PRECISELY WILL THE NEW ORGANIZATION BE THAT IS TO REPLACE IT
IT IS ONLY UNDER THE EXISTING REGIME THAT AS GOVERNOR PROSECUTOR SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COUNCILS THEY CAN RECEIVE THEIR SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF RUBLES A YEAR WITHOUT WHICH THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES WOULD AT ONCE SINK INTO RUIN SINCE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE POSITION THEY OCCUPY THEY WOULD NEVER BY THEIR OWN ABILITIES INDUSTRY OR ACQUIREMENTS GET A THOUSANDTH PART OF THEIR SALARIES
AND THUS THE INSUFFICIENCY OF PERSONAL HUMAN LOVE IS MADE MANIFEST
MEN THINK THEY CAN ACCEPT CHRISTIANITY WITHOUT ALTERING THEIR LIFE--PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH PRESENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY AND CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION ALONE CAN ACCORD WITH IT--CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE NOT YET UNDERSTOOD BY MEN BUT THE PROGRESS OF LIFE ITSELF WILL LEAD THEM INEVITABLY TO ADOPT IT--THE REQUIREMENTS OF A NEW THEORY OF LIFE ALWAYS SEEM INCOMPREHENSIBLE MYSTIC AND SUPERNATURAL--SO SEEM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE TO THE MAJORITY OF MEN--THE ABSORPTION OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WILL INEVITABLY BE BROUGHT ABOUT AS THE RESULT OF MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL CAUSES--THE FACT OF MEN KNOWING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HIGHER VIEW OF LIFE AND YET CONTINUING TO PRESERVE INFERIOR ORGANIZATIONS OF LIFE LEADS TO CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS WHICH EMBITTER EXISTENCE AND MUST RESULT IN ITS TRANSFORMATION--THE CONTRADICTIONS OF OUR LIFE--THE ECONOMIC CONTRADICTION AND THE SUFFERING INDUCED BY IT FOR RICH AND POOR
THESE PERSONS IN AUTHORITY NEVER DO THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SUGGEST DECIDE OR COMMAND TO BE DONE
HE WAS NOT TAKING ANY REFRESHMENT AND HAD AN IMPENETRABLE BORED EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE WERE WEARY OF THE FORMALITIES TO BE GONE THROUGH
IF A MAN THROUGH THE GROWTH OF A HIGHER CONSCIENCE CAN NO LONGER COMPLY WITH THE DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT HE FINDS HIMSELF CRAMPED BY IT AND AT THE SAME TIME NO LONGER NEEDS ITS PROTECTION
GOVERNMENTS CONSENT TO DECIDE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS BY ARBITRATION AND TO DISBAND THEIR ARMIES
THOUGH THE NEED OF A CHANGE OF LIFE IS PREACHED BY THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND RECOGNIZED AND REALIZED BY THE MOST INTELLIGENT MEN THE MAJORITY IN SPITE OF THEIR REVERENTIAL ATTITUDE TO THEIR LEADERS THAT IS THEIR FAITH IN THEIR TEACHING CONTINUE TO BE GUIDED BY THE OLD THEORY OF LIFE IN THEIR PRESENT COMPLEX EXISTENCE
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN SUCH A POSITION IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO ANYONE WHATEVER BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WISH IT
THEY TRY NOT TO SEE THAT THEY ALL ENJOY THEIR PRIVILEGES AS A RESULT OF THE SAME FACT WHICH FORCES THE PEASANTS WHO HAVE TENDED THE FOREST AND WHO ARE IN THE DIRECT NEED OF IT FOR FUEL TO GIVE IT UP TO A RICH LANDOWNER WHO HAS TAKEN NO PART IN CARING FOR ITS GROWTH AND HAS NO NEED OF IT WHATEVER--THE FACT THAT IS THAT IF THEY DON'T GIVE IT UP THEY WILL BE FLOGGED OR KILLED
A CONDITION WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO REFUSING TO HAVE IT REBUILT AT ALL
BOSTON 1838
IT APPEARS TO US A SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH THAT WHATEVER THE GOSPEL IS DESIGNED TO DESTROY AT ANY PERIOD OF THE WORLD BEING CONTRARY TO IT OUGHT NOW TO BE ABANDONED
IF HE SACRIFICES TOO A PORTION OF HIS ILL-GOTTEN GAINS ON A CHURCH AND THE POOR THEN HE IS AN EXEMPLARY CHRISTIAN
WITH WARPED AND ROTTEN PLANKS YOU CANNOT BUILD A HOUSE HOWEVER YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER
MOVE ON
IT IS BETTER FOR ONE MAN TO DIE THAT THE WHOLE PEOPLE PERISH NOT
BUT EVEN THIS STEP DOES NOT RID THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES OF THE INCONVENIENT MAN
LA DESIGNATION MEME D'HERESIE SEMBLE UNE ATTEINTE PORTEE A LA LIBERTE DE CONSCIENCE ET DE PENSEE
AND ALL THE WHILE HE KNOWS THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE IS FRAMED ON PRINCIPLES IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO IT ALL TO ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIANITY HUMANITY JUSTICE AND SCIENCE
I RAN AFTER THE BIRDS WITH THE SALT IN MY HAND BUT I SOON CONVINCED MYSELF THAT IF I COULD PUT SALT ON A BIRD'S TAIL I COULD CATCH IT AND REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN HOAXED
AND TO SUPPORT CHRISTIANITY WHEN CHRISTIANITY DESTROYS ALL GOVERNMENT
AND THEN THE SO-CALLED FATHER GOES AWAY WITH A SENSE OF HAVING CORRECTLY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY DONE HIS DUTY
AND IF ALL MEN CARRIED IT OUT THEN THE HUMAN RACE WOULD COME TO AN END THEY SAY
E THOSE PROFESSING FAITH IN CHRIST--TO MY BOOK
THAT OBJECT IS TO CONCEAL THE REAL MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING AND TO REPLACE IT BY THEIR OWN WHICH LAYS NO OBLIGATION ON THEM EXCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE TEACHING OF CHRIST AND WHAT IS THE CHIEF CONSIDERATION JUSTIFIES THE EXISTENCE OF PRIESTS SUPPORTED AT THE PEOPLE'S EXPENSE
AND THE SAME WITH THE PROHIBITION OF SWEARING
HE DOES NOT SEE WHAT HE HAS PASSED WHICH IS HIDDEN IN THE DARKNESS
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES OF ME TO DO UNTO TWO MILLIONS OF SLAVES AT THAT TIME THERE WERE SLAVES
208-13 HERE IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE FORCE IS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WORK THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEN WHO MAKE UP THE MASSES
BUT THE AUTHOR DOES NOT THINK SO
WITH FEW AND RARE EXCEPTIONS HE CONTINUES THE WHOLE OF CHRISTENDOM FROM THE DAYS OF THE APOSTLES DOWN TO OUR OWN HAS COME TO THE FIRM CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE OBJECT OF CHRIST TO LAY DOWN GREAT ETERNAL PRINCIPLES BUT NOT TO DISTURB THE BASES AND REVOLUTIONIZE THE INSTITUTIONS OF ALL HUMAN SOCIETY WHICH THEMSELVES REST ON DIVINE SANCTIONS AS WELL AS ON INEVITABLE CONDITIONS
CHRIST BY MEANS OF HIS DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ALL THE WORLD IN HIS NET OF FAITH BUT THE GREATER FISHES BROKE THE NET AND ESCAPED OUT OF IT AND ALL THE REST HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE HOLES MADE BY THE GREATER FISHES SO THAT THE NET HAS REMAINED QUITE EMPTY
HE KNOWS THIS IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS CONSCIENCE AND ALL THE SAME HE SEEMS UNABLE TO CHANGE HIS POSITION
CHRIST--DEFINITIONS OF A CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE CATECHISMS--THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SEVERAL IN NUMBER AND HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER--WHAT IS HERESY--THE WORK OF G
BUT ONE NEED ONLY COMPARE THE ATTITUDE OF THE TEACHERS OF THE CHURCH TO THIS AND TO OTHER COMMANDS WHICH THEY REALLY DO RECOGNIZE TO BE CONVINCED THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TO THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR ATTITUDE TO OTHER DUTIES
IT WAS ONLY IN 1888 THAT I LEARNED THAT THE PRINTING OF THE BOOK WHICH HAD BEEN BEGUN WAS STOPPED
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO REFUTE THIS LAST ARGUMENT
ASK THEM THE QUESTION
IN THE PROCESS OF LIBERATING OF STRENGTHENING THIS FORCE THE TRUE LIFE OF MAN ACCORDING TO CHRIST'S TEACHING CONSISTS
IT IS THE EFFORT TO BREAK THROUGH THE PETRIFIED AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH
THEY ARE LIKE CLOUDS WHICH HAVE FORM AND BEAUTY ONLY FROM THE DISTANCE
IT IS ALTOGETHER UNNECESSARY FOR ME
WE THEREFORE VOLUNTARILY EXCLUDE OURSELVES FROM EVERY LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BODY AND REPUDIATE ALL HUMAN POLITICS WORLDLY HONORS AND STATIONS OF AUTHORITY
THE FACT THAT MEN CALLED WHAT WAS FORMED AFTERWARD BY THE SAME WORD AS CHRIST USED FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT DOES NOT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THAT CHRIST FOUNDED THE ONE TRUE CHURCH
FOR THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE SWORD SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD
WHEN IN THE WORDS OF CHRIST THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN IN THE EAR IS PROCLAIMED FROM THE HOUSETOPS
ONE SECTION LOOK AT IT AS AN INCIDENTAL PHENOMENON ARISING OUT OF THE SPECIAL POLITICAL SITUATION OF EUROPE AND CONSIDER THAT THIS STATE OF THINGS CAN BE REFORMED WITHOUT A REVOLUTION IN THE WHOLE INTERNAL SOCIAL ORDER OF NATIONS BY EXTERNAL MEASURES OF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY
NO HOSTILITIES TO BE COMMENCED TILL A MONTH AFTER THE OFFICIAL DECLARATION OF WAR
ARE WE READY TO GIVE UP ALL THE RESULTS WE HAVE ATTAINED WITH SUCH EFFORT RESULTS OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN BOASTING FOR THREE CENTURIES
EVER SINCE CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN OUTWARDLY PROFESSED THIS QUESTION IS FOR MEN IN THEIR SOCIAL LIFE LIKE THE QUESTION WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF TO A TRAVELER WHEN THE ROAD ON WHICH HE HAS BEEN JOURNEYING DIVIDES INTO TWO BRANCHES
THE CONGRESS EXPRESSES THE OPINION THAT ALL TEACHERS OF HISTORY SHOULD CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG TO THE GRAVE EVILS INFLICTED ON MANKIND IN ALL AGES BY WAR AND TO THE FACT THAT SUCH WAR HAS BEEN WAGED FOR MOST INADEQUATE CAUSES
ONE MIGHT THINK THERE WAS NO IMPORTANCE IN SUCH INCIDENTS
AND THIS THEY DO BUT THEIR POSITION IS NONE THE LESS DESPERATE
THE OPPRESSED WOULD BE ANOTHER SET OF PEOPLE AND COERCION WOULD TAKE SOME NEW FORM
NON-CHRISTIANS THAT IS THOSE WHO FIND THE AIM OF THEIR LIVES IN EARTHLY HAPPINESS MUST ALWAYS RULE CHRISTIANS THE AIM OF WHOSE LIVES IS THE RENUNCIATION OF SUCH EARTHLY HAPPINESS
I AM DEAR SIR ETC CAMILLE DOUCET THE UPSHOT OF THIS IS THAT PERSONAL HONOR REQUIRES MEN TO FIGHT AND THE INTERESTS OF NATIONS REQUIRE THEM TO RUIN AND EXTERMINATE EACH OTHER
IF WE TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW WHAT WE SHALL EAT AND WHAT WE SHALL DRINK AND WHEREWITHAL WE SHALL BE CLOTHED DO NOT DEFEND OUR LIFE NOR RESIST EVIL BY FORCE LAY DOWN OUR LIFE FOR OTHERS AND OBSERVE PERFECT CHASTITY THE HUMAN RACE CANNOT EXIST THEY SAY
IF ONLY ONE MAN ACTED THUS AND ALL THE REST AGREED TO CRUCIFY HIM WOULD IT NOT BE NOBLER FOR HIM TO DIE IN THE GLORY OF NON-RESISTING LOVE PRAYING FOR HIS ENEMIES THAN TO LIVE TO WEAR THE CROWN OF CAESAR STAINED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN
THE AIM OF LIFE IS THE SATISFACTION OF THE WILL OF THIS INDIVIDUALITY
HUMANITY CAN NO MORE GO BACKWARD IN ITS DEVELOPMENT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL MAN
THIS IS THE GIST OF DYMOND'S ANSWER
PRIESTS WHO ABJURE DECEPTION
PEACE WILL SOON BE ARRANGED THANKS TO ALLIANCES AND CONGRESSES TO BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS
THE POSITION OF OUR CHRISTIAN HUMANITY IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE WITH ALL ITS CRUELTY AND DEGRADATION OF MEN IS TERRIBLE INDEED
SO THAT EVEN IN CHINA THIS IS ONLY AN IMAGINARY CUSTOM
THIS BELIEF IS FOUNDED ON A CONSCIOUS DECEPTION PRACTICED ON THEM BY THE HIGHER CLASSES
IN THE MORNING THE COMMANDANT TOLD ME THAT FIVE PEASANTS BELONGING TO A LANDOWNER IN THE TAMBOFF GOVERNMENT HAD LATELY BEEN SENT TO GEORGIA
IF THE FATHER OF A FAMILY CONTINUES TO BE GUIDED IN HIS CONDUCT BY HIS CHILDISH CONCEPTIONS OF LIFE LIFE BECOMES SO DIFFICULT FOR HIM THAT HE INVOLUNTARILY SEEKS ANOTHER PHILOSOPHY AND READILY ABSORBS THAT WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO HIS AGE
SAYING NOTHING OF THE ANIMAL FORCE WHICH ASSERTS ITSELF REMAINS ALWAYS THE SAME AND IS THEREFORE INDEPENDENT OF HUMAN WILL CHRIST SPEAKS ONLY OF THE DIVINE FORCE CALLING UPON A MAN TO KNOW IT MORE CLOSELY TO SET IT MORE FREE FROM ALL THAT RETARDS IT AND TO CARRY IT TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF INTENSITY
MOST OF ALL THE TEACHING OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH WITH ITS IDOLATROUS OBSERVANCES
AND JUST AS THE DREAMER NEED ONLY MAKE A MORAL EFFORT AND ASK HIMSELF ISN'T IT A DREAM AND THE SITUATION WHICH SEEMED TO HIM SO HOPELESS WILL INSTANTLY DISAPPEAR AND HE WILL WAKE UP TO PEACEFUL AND HAPPY REALITY SO THE MAN OF THE MODERN WORLD NEED ONLY MAKE A MORAL EFFORT TO DOUBT THE REALITY PRESENTED TO HIM BY HIS OWN HYPOCRISY AND THE GENERAL HYPOCRISY AROUND HIM AND TO ASK HIMSELF ISN'T IT ALL A DELUSION AND HE WILL AT ONCE LIKE THE DREAMER AWAKENED FEEL HIMSELF TRANSPORTED FROM AN IMAGINARY AND DREADFUL WORLD TO THE TRUE CALM AND HAPPY REALITY
THERE ARE NO ACTS IN THIS DOCTRINE WHICH COULD JUSTIFY A MAN AND MAKE HIM SAVED
WHILE SOCIALISTS AND COMMUNISTS REGARD THE INDIVIDUALISTIC CAPITALISTIC ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY AS AN EVIL AND THE ANARCHISTS REGARD AS AN EVIL ALL GOVERNMENT WHATEVER THERE ARE ROYALISTS CONSERVATIVES AND CAPITALISTS WHO CONSIDER ANY SOCIALISTIC OR COMMUNISTIC ORGANIZATION OR ANARCHY AS AN EVIL AND ALL THESE PARTIES HAVE NO MEANS OTHER THAN VIOLENCE TO BRING MEN TO AGREEMENT
THOSE WHO FIND THEIR DEFENSE IN THE SECOND THE THIRD OR THE FOURTH METHOD ARE CONFUSED AND CAN EASILY BE CONVICTED OF ERROR
AND IN THE STATE WE REACH THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO
THERE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR CASES ALSO IN PRUSSIA
THIEVES ROBBERS MURDERERS AND CHEATS WHO COMMIT CRIMES RECOGNIZED BY THEMSELVES AND EVERYONE ELSE AS EVIL SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT OUGHT NOT TO BE DONE AND DETER OTHERS FROM SIMILAR CRIMES
EVERY EDUCATED MAN IF HE BELIEVES IN ANYTHING BELIEVES IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF ALL MEN OR AT LEAST HE HAS A SENTIMENT OF HUMANITY OR ELSE OF JUSTICE OR ELSE HE BELIEVES IN SCIENCE
THE MOTIVES IN ALL THESE CASES ARE SO EXCELLENT THAT HOWEVER DESPOTIC GOVERNMENTS MAY BE THEY COULD HARDLY PUNISH THEM OPENLY
THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF MEN WHO JUDGE OF THE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE STATE PRINCIPLE CONSISTS IN THE FACT THAT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE PERFECTION WHICH CHRIST POINTS TO CAN BE FULLY ATTAINED THEY ASK THEMSELVES JUST AS THEY ASK THE SAME QUESTION ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT STATE LAWS WILL BE CARRIED OUT WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF ALL THIS BEING CARRIED OUT
THERE IS THE ABSTRACT CONCEPTION OF MAN
THE SECOND SOLUTION--NOT FORCIBLY TO RESIST WHAT WE CONSIDER EVIL UNTIL WE HAVE FOUND A UNIVERSAL CRITERION--THAT IS THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY CHRIST
SUCH ARE THE TWO PRINCIPAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS RELATING TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION FROM WHICH THE GREATER NUMBER OF FALSE REASONINGS ABOUT IT PROCEED
THERE HE IS PERSECUTED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF BUT HE DOES NOT FOR ALL THAT ALTER HIS DECISION NOT TO BEAR ARMS AND HE EXPLAINS WHY HE WILL NOT DO THIS TO EVERYONE WITH WHOM HE IS BROUGHT IN CONTACT
IF WE GLANCE AT THE BUDGETS OF THE STATES OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS WHAT STRIKES US MOST OF ALL IS THEIR RAPID AND CONTINUALLY GROWING INCREASE
SO THAT MEN SOMETIMES COME TO THEIR SENSES LONG BEFORE PERPETRATING THE SUGGESTED CRIME SOMETIMES AT THE VERY MOMENT BEFORE PERPETRATING IT SOMETIMES ONLY AFTERWARD
A MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WHETHER HE BELIEVES IN THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST OR NOT CANNOT FAIL TO SEE THAT TO ASSIST IN THE CAPACITY OF TZAR MINISTER GOVERNOR OR COMMISSIONER IN TAKING FROM A POOR FAMILY ITS LAST COW FOR TAXES TO BE SPENT ON CANNONS OR ON THE PAY AND PENSIONS OF IDLE OFFICIALS WHO LIVE IN LUXURY AND ARE WORSE THAN USELESS
THEN IT IS SUPPOSED THAT HE IS A SECTARY AND THEREFORE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND CHRISTIANITY IN THE RIGHT SENSE THAT IS TO SAY NOT IN THE SENSE IN WHICH THE PRIESTS IN THE PAY OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTAND IT
BUT NOT SO
MEANWHILE THE TORTURED MAN HALF NAKED PALE AND SCOWLING STOOD WAITING HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND AND HIS TEETH CHATTERING
IN THE SAME COMPARTMENT WITH ME WAS A WOOD MERCHANT WHO HAD RISEN FROM A PEASANT
BUT WHAT IS THIS CONVICTION BASED ON
THE SPECIAL TRAIN CONSISTED OF ONE FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE FOR THE GOVERNOR THE OFFICIALS AND OFFICERS AND SEVERAL LUGGAGE VANS CRAMMED FULL OF SOLDIERS
BUT THE FACT THAT EACH BRANCH COMES FROM THE ONE ROOT DOES NOT PROVE AT ALL THAT EACH BRANCH WAS THE ONLY ONE
OF WHOM WAS HE SPEAKING IN THE WORDS YE HAVE HEARD IT WAS SAID OF OLD
SWITZERLAND BELGIUM DENMARK AND HOLLAND HAVE ALL DECLARED THAT THEY PREFER ARBITRATION TO WAR I DARE SAY MONACO HAS EXPRESSED THE SAME PREFERENCE
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN SUFFERETH VIOLENCE AND THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE MATT
ON A FIXED DAY THEY COLLECT THEM DRIVE THEM TOGETHER LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP AND BEGIN TO TRAIN THEM IN THE MILITARY EXERCISES AND DRILL
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER-OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
AND WHY TAKE YE THOUGHT FOR RAINMENT
THUS ONE CHAPTER IN A BOOK OF HIS TREATS OF NON-RESISTANCE IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES AND HE OWNS IN THIS CONNECTION THAT IF THERE WERE CASES IN WHICH THE RULE OF NON-RESISTANCE WERE IMPOSSIBLE OF APPLICATION IT WOULD PROVE THAT THE LAW WAS NOT UNIVERSALLY AUTHORITATIVE
AND THIS IS THE ONLY EXPLANATION OF THE DREADFUL INTENSITY WITH WHICH MEN OF MODERN TIMES STRIVE TO STUPEFY THEMSELVES WITH SPIRITS TOBACCO OPIUM CARDS READING NEWSPAPERS TRAVELING AND ALL KINDS OF SPECTACLES AND AMUSEMENTS
OR WHEREWITHAL SHALL WE BE CLOTHED
AND THEREFORE ALL MEN MUST WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY MOVE ALONG THE WAY OF TRUTH SOME SPONTANEOUSLY ACCOMPLISHING THE TASK SET THEM IN LIFE OTHERS SUBMITTING INVOLUNTARILY TO THE LAW OF LIFE
THE ORGANIZATION OF OUR TEMPORARY EXTERNAL LIFE THE LIFE OF SOCIETY OR OF THE STATE
NO ONE CONDITION ACCORDING TO THIS DOCTRINE CAN BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ANOTHER
RAILWAYS TELEGRAPHS TELEPHONES PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE GREAT PERFECTION OF THE MEANS OF GETTING RID OF MEN FOR YEARS WITHOUT KILLING THEM BY SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WHERE HIDDEN FROM THE WORLD THEY PERISH AND ARE FORGOTTEN AND THE MANY OTHER MODERN INVENTIONS EMPLOYED BY GOVERNMENT GIVE SUCH POWER THAT WHEN ONCE AUTHORITY HAS COME INTO CERTAIN HANDS THE POLICE OPEN AND SECRET THE ADMINISTRATION AND PROSECUTORS JAILERS AND EXECUTIONERS OF ALL KINDS DO THEIR WORK SO ZEALOUSLY THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF OVERTURNING THE GOVERNMENT HOWEVER CRUEL AND SENSELESS IT MAY BE
AND IT IS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE AND UNPROFITABLE TO THINK AT PRESENT OF ANYTHING SO IMPRACTICABLE AS THE SUPPRESSION OF AUTHORITY
AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THEIR PRACTICAL WORK
SO THAT WHILE IN FORMER DAYS A MAN WHO PROFESSED THE RELIGION OF THE CHURCH COULD TAKE PART IN ALL THE CRIMES OF THE STATE AND PROFIT BY THEM AND STILL REGARD HIMSELF AS FREE FROM ANY TAINT OF SIN SO LONG AS HE FULFILLED THE EXTERNAL OBSERVANCES OF HIS CREED NOWADAYS ALL WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE CHRISTIANITY OF THE CHURCH FIND SIMILAR WELL-FOUNDED IRREFUTABLE REASONS IN SCIENCE FOR REGARDING THEMSELVES AS BLAMELESS AND EVEN HIGHLY MORAL IN SPITE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE MISDEEDS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE ADVANTAGES THEY GAIN FROM THEM
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE-THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
SUCH A MAN LIVES WORKING AT HIS WORK OR ENJOYING HIS AMUSEMENTS SPENDING THE FRUITS OF HIS LABORS ON HIMSELF OR ON THOSE NEAR TO HIM AND LIKE EVERYONE HATING EVERY KIND OF RESTRICTION AND DEPRIVATION DISSENSION AND SUFFERING
BUT THERE ARE TRUTHS OF A THIRD KIND WHICH HAVE NOT YET BECOME AN UNCONSCIOUS MOTIVE OF ACTION BUT YET HAVE BEEN REVEALED SO CLEARLY TO HIM THAT HE CANNOT PASS THEM BY AND IS INEVITABLY OBLIGED TO DO ONE THING OR THE OTHER TO RECOGNIZE OR NOT TO RECOGNIZE THEM
A MAN MIGHT BE PLACED UNDER THE NECESSITY OF CONFESSING HIS FAITH OR HE MIGHT LIVE ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT BEING PLACED UNDER THIS NECESSITY
THAT IS HOW THE ORTHODOX CLERGY PROCEED
TO TERRIFY THEM BY THREATS IS STILL LESS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE DEPRIVATIONS AND SUFFERINGS TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECTED ONLY STRENGTHEN THEIR DESIRE TO FOLLOW THE FAITH BY WHICH THEY ARE COMMANDED
IN PLACE OF ALL THE RULES OF THE OLD RELIGIONS THIS DOCTRINE SETS UP ONLY A TYPE OF INWARD PERFECTION TRUTH AND LOVE IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND--AS A RESULT OF THIS INWARD PERFECTION BEING ATTAINED BY MEN--ALSO THE OUTWARD PERFECTION FORETOLD BY THE PROPHETS--THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHEN ALL MEN WILL CEASE TO LEARN TO MAKE WAR WHEN ALL SHALL BE TAUGHT OF GOD AND UNITED IN LOVE AND THE LION WILL LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB
AND TO PUT MEN TO DEATH WHO ARE REGARDED AS GOOD MEN IS TO PROVOKE OTHERS TO CHAMPION THEM AND JUSTIFY THEIR REFUSAL
IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE CONVINCED THAT THE ACT IN WHICH THEY ARE TAKING PART WILL TEND TO SUPPORT RATHER THAN TO RUIN THE STATE
THE CRITICISMS OF MY BOOK RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN ALIKE FALL UNDER TWO GENERAL DIVISIONS--THE RELIGIOUS CRITICISMS OF MEN WHO REGARD THEMSELVES AS BELIEVERS AND SECULAR CRITICISMS THAT IS THOSE OF FREETHINKERS
TO LOVE--FOR ONE'S OWN SAKE THROUGH PERSONAL PRIDE--ONE'S TRIBE ONE'S NATION THOUGH NOT SO NATURAL IS NEVERTHELESS COMMON
NEXT IT IS INSTILLED INTO HIM THAT IF A MAN AND WOMAN WANT THEIR PHYSICAL UNION TO BE SANCTIFIED THEY MUST GO TO CHURCH PUT ON METAL CROWNS DRINK CERTAIN POTIONS WALK THREE TIMES ROUND A TABLE TO THE SOUND OF SINGING AND THAT THEN THE PHYSICAL UNION OF A MAN AND WOMAN BECOMES SACRED AND ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER SUCH UNIONS
THERE ARE NO CRIMES SO REVOLTING THAT THEY WOULD NOT READILY BE COMMITTED BY MEN WHO FORM PART OF A GOVERNMENT OR ARMY AT THE WILL OF ANYONE SUCH AS BOULANGER NAPOLEON OR POUGACHEF WHO MAY CHANCE TO BE AT THEIR HEAD
ALL THESE MEN AND THOSE WHO DEPEND ON THEM THEIR WIVES TUTORS CHILDREN COOKS ACTORS JOCKEYS AND SO ON ARE LIVING ON THE BLOOD WHICH BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER THROUGH ONE SET OF BLOOD-SUCKERS OR ANOTHER IS DRAWN OUT OF THE WORKING CLASS AND EVERY DAY THEIR PLEASURES COST HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DAYS OF LABOR
THIS THEN IS THE WORK OF THE CHURCHES
STRIKING INSTANCE OF THIS IS THE SUBMISSION TO COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE WHICH IT WOULD BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR EVERY MAN TO REFUSE THAN TO SUBMIT TO--THE EMANCIPATION OF MEN CAN ONLY BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY EACH INDIVIDUAL EMANCIPATING HIMSELF AND THE EXAMPLES OF THIS SELF-EMANCIPATION WHICH ARE ALREADY APPEARING THREATEN THE DESTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY--REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE UNCHRISTIAN DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENT UNDERMINES THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE AND EMANCIPATES MEN--AND THEREFORE CASES OF SUCH NON-COMPLIANCE ARE REGARDED WITH MORE DREAD BY STATE AUTHORITIES THAN ANY CONSPIRACIES OR ACTS OF VIOLENCE--EXAMPLES OF NON-COMPLIANCE IN RUSSIA IN REGARD TO OATH OF ALLEGIANCE PAYMENT OF TAXES PASSPORTS POLICE DUTIES AND MILITARY SERVICE--EXAMPLES OF SUCH NON-COMPLIANCE IN OTHER STATES--GOVERNMENTS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TREAT MEN WHO REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH THEIR DEMANDS ON CHRISTIAN GROUNDS--SUCH PEOPLE WITHOUT STRIKING A BLOW UNDERMINE THE VERY BASIS OF GOVERNMENT FROM
AND CAN THE CHRISTIAN OR CAN HE NOT REMAINING A CHRISTIAN TAKE PART IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT USING COMPULSION AGAINST HIS NEIGHBORS
THEY ARE CALLED THE DEFENSELESS OR NON-RESISTANT CHRISTIANS
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GOSPEL IS HIDDEN FROM BELIEVERS BY THE CHURCH FROM UNBELIEVERS BY SCIENCE
AND ALL THIS IS DONE EVERY YEAR EVERY AUTUMN EVERYWHERE THROUGH ALL RUSSIA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE MIDST OF LARGE TOWNS WHERE ALL MAY SEE IT AND THE DECEPTION IS SO CLEVER SO SKILLFUL THAT THOUGH ALL MEN KNOW THE INFAMY OF IT IN THEIR HEARTS AND SEE ALL ITS HORRIBLE RESULTS THEY CANNOT THROW IT OFF AND BE FREE
AND SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT MEN OF TO-DAY CANNOT PRETEND THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THESE DUTIES
IF ALL MEN REFUSED TO RESIST EVIL BY EVIL OUR WORLD WOULD BE HAPPY
WHY SHOULD I EXPOSE MY LIFE TO DANGER TO KILL IN BATTLE SOME MAN WHO HAS DONE ME NO HARM
THE TEACHING OF EVERY CHURCH WITH ITS REDEMPTION AND SACRAMENTS EXCLUDES THE TEACHING OF CHRIST
EVERY GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS AS GREAT AN ARMY AS IT POSSIBLY COULD MAINTAIN IF ITS PEOPLE WERE THREATENED WITH EXTERMINATION AND PEOPLE CALL PEACE THIS STATE OF TENSION OF ALL AGAINST ALL
AND SUCH A THEORY IS THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF LIFE MADE KNOWN TO MANKIND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO
SOON IT PASSES AWAY LEAVING NO TRACE
KEEP MY SAYINGS AND YE SHALL KNOW OF MY SAYINGS WHETHER THEY BE TRUE NO PROOFS OF THIS DOCTRINE WERE OFFERED EXCEPT ITS TRUTH THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE DOCTRINE WITH THE TRUTH
AS LANDOWNER OR MANUFACTURER OF GIVING UP DEFENDING YOUR PROPERTY BY FRAUD AND FORCE
CHAPTER VII
UNIFORM IS THE ATTITUDE OF ALL THE CHURCHES TO THE TEACHING OF CHRIST WHOSE NAME THEY ASSUME FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE
IT IS INCOMPARABLY LESS DANGEROUS TO ACT JUSTLY THAN UNJUSTLY TO SUBMIT TO INJURIES THAN TO RESIST THEM WITH VIOLENCE LESS DANGEROUS EVEN IN ONE'S RELATIONS TO THE PRESENT LIFE
ONLY LET MEN CEASE TO BE HYPOCRITES AND THEY WOULD AT ONCE SEE THAT THIS CRUEL SOCIAL ORGANIZATION WHICH HOLDS THEM IN BONDAGE AND IS REPRESENTED TO THEM AS SOMETHING STABLE NECESSARY AND ORDAINED OF GOD IS ALREADY TOTTERING AND IS ONLY PROPPED UP BY THE FALSEHOOD OF HYPOCRISY WITH WHICH WE AND OTHERS LIKE US SUPPORT IT
THAT TO MAKE IT QUITE RIGHT WE MUST REJECT ALL IN IT THAT IS SUPERFLUOUS AND UNNECESSARY TO OUR MANNER OF LIFE
AND SO IT WOULD BE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE LOGIC OF HYPOCRISY WHICH REASONS THAT FROM A RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW POSSESSION OR NON-POSSESSION OF LAND IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE FOR SALVATION AND FROM THE SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW GIVING UP THE OWNERSHIP OF LAND IS A USELESS INDIVIDUAL RENUNCIATION AND THAT THE WELFARE OF MANKIND IS NOT PROMOTED IN THAT WAY BUT BY A GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF EXTERNAL FORMS
TO CARRY OUT EXACTLY AND WITHOUT COMMENT THE ORDERS OF A SUPERIOR OFFICER MEANS
BUT ALL THE EXPERIENCE OF HISTORY TEACHES US THAT THEY CANNOT BE ALTOGETHER SUPPRESSED SO LONG AS TWO MEN ARE LEFT ON EARTH WITH BREAD MONEY AND A WOMAN BETWEEN THEM
EVERYONE KNOWS THIS BEYOND DOUBT
AND DOES NOT EXACTLY THE SAME THING SHOW ITSELF EVEN IN CONTEMPORARY REVIVALISM--THE REVIVED CALVINISM AND EVANGELICALISM TO WHICH THE SALVATION ARMY OWES ITS ORIGIN
HE IS WAVERING AND NONE CAN SAY BEFOREHAND WHAT HE WILL DO
A COURT OF ARBITRATION
AND THEREFORE THE AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENT MUST NOT BE SUPPRESSED TILL ALL THE WICKED AND RAPACIOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE EXTINCT
IN THE FIRST CASE IF THE PEASANTS OFFER RESISTANCE THE PRACTICE IS IN RUSSIA AND IT IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE WHERE A STATE ORGANIZATION AND PRIVATE PROPERTY EXIST AS FOLLOWS
BUT WHEN THE EGYPTIANS CONQUERED THE JEWS THE ROMANS CONQUERED THE GREEKS AND THE BARBARIANS CONQUERED THE ROMANS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE CONQUERORS WERE ALWAYS BETTER THAN THOSE THEY CONQUERED
YOUR DUTIES AS A CITIZEN CANNOT BUT BE SUBORDINATED TO THE SUPERIOR OBLIGATIONS OF THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD AND CANNOT BE IN OPPOSITION TO THEM
A THIRD PARTY WITH COOL INDIFFERENCE CONSIDER WAR AS AN INEVITABLE PHENOMENON BENEFICIAL IN ITS EFFECTS AND THEREFORE DESIRABLE
TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ENEMIES CAST THEM INTO PRISON EXILE OR EXECUTE THEM IS OBVIOUSLY NOT TO FORGIVE BUT TO TAKE RETRIBUTION
THIS WAS HOW THE GOVERNMENT BEHAVED SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO--THIS IS HOW IT HAS BEHAVED IN A GREAT CUMBER OF CASES STUDIOUSLY CONCEALED FROM THE PEOPLE
THE RICH KNOW THAT THEY ARE GUILTY IN THE VERY FACT OF BEING RICH AND TRY TO EXPIATE THEIR GUILT BY SACRIFICES TO ART AND SCIENCE AS OF OLD THEY EXPIATED THEIR SINS BY SACRIFICES TO THE CHURCH
THE LUTHERAN CATECHISM SAYS
THE LUTHERAN CATECHISM SAYS
WE RECOGNIZE THE USELESSNESS OF CUSTOMS AND IMPORT DUTIES AND ARE OBLIGED TO PAY THEM
ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS ALWAYS FORCED TO ADOPT THE ORGANIZATION OF LIFE EXISTING IN THE CONQUERED NATION
IF WE HAVE BEGUN BY LIVING SINFULLY AS WE DO LIVE AND ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE
EVERY BRANCH IN A TREE COMES FROM THE ROOT IN UNBROKEN CONNECTION
CHAPTER XII
AND THEREFORE THE SUPPRESSION OF STATE VIOLENCE CANNOT IN ANY CASE BE THE CAUSE OF INCREASED OPPRESSION OF THE GOOD BY THE WICKED
EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE SAME RULERS AND THE SAME GOVERNMENTS THE SAME ARMIES THE SAME LAW COURTS THE SAME TAX-GATHERERS THE SAME PRIESTS THE SAME RICH MEN LANDOWNERS MANUFACTURERS AND CAPITALISTS AS EVER BUT THE ATTITUDE OF THE WORLD TO THEM AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO THEMSELVES IS ALTOGETHER CHANGED
SOUS PRETEXTE DE L'ELARGIR ON LA DISSOUT
HERE IS THE TENOR OF THE AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS DISCUSSED AMONG OFFICIALS AND CIRCULATED IN A GREAT NUMBER OF MANUSCRIPT AND LITHOGRAPH COPIES AND IN TRANSLATIONS PRINTED ABROAD
AND THIS RESULTS IN A GENERAL FEELING OF INSECURITY AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF EACH GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THEIR FORCES BEYOND THOSE OF THE OTHER POWERS
AND HOW ARE WE TO LOVE MEN IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES WHEN EVERY FRESH DAY IS A MENACE OF DANGER
THE SAME LAWYERS AND JUDGES AND THE SAME ASSIZES BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THE CIVIL COURTS DECIDE CASES ON THE MOST DIVERSE GROUNDS BUT REGARDLESS OF JUSTICE AND THAT CRIMINAL TRIALS ARE QUITE SENSELESS BECAUSE THE PUNISHMENTS DO NOT ATTAIN THE OBJECTS AIMED AT BY THE JUDGES THEMSELVES
WHEN THE SEVENTIETH STROKE HAD BEEN REACHED THE GOVERNOR SAID ENOUGH
LIVE ACCORDING TO YOUR NATURE UNDERSTANDING BY THIS THE DIVINE NATURE
AND YET THE VERY MAN WHO SEES ALL THE BASENESS OF THOSE ACTIONS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL UNCOERCED BY ANYONE OFTEN EVEN FOR NO PECUNIARY PROFIT BUT ONLY FROM CHILDISH VANITY FOR A CHINA CROSS A SCRAP OF RIBBON A BIT OF FRINGE HE IS ALLOWED TO WEAR WILL ENTER MILITARY SERVICE BECOME A MAGISTRATE OR JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONER ARCHBISHOP OR BEADLE THOUGH IN FULFILLING THESE OFFICES HE MUST COMMIT ACTS THE BASENESS AND SHAMEFULNESS OF WHICH HE CANNOT FAIL TO RECOGNIZE
ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT EVIDENT THAT THE FIRST THING SUCH A MAN MUST DO IF HE WISHES TO APPROXIMATE TO CHRISTIANITY OR LIBERALISM WOULD BE TO CEASE TO PLUNDER AND RUIN MEN BY MEANS OF ACTS OF STATE VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT OF HIS CLAIM TO THE LAND
WHILE UNDER THE INTOXICATING INFLUENCE OF SERVILITY THEY IMAGINED THEMSELVES BOUND TO CARRY OUT TO THE LETTER THE INSTRUCTIONS INSCRIBED IN A CERTAIN BOOK THE SO-CALLED LAW
BUT THE CHURCHES SET UP DEAD FORMS IN THE PLACE OF GOD AND FAR FROM REVEALING GOD THEY OBSCURE HIM FROM MEN'S SIGHT
AND SO THE MOVEMENT GOES ON MORE AND MORE QUICKLY AND ON AN EVER-INCREASING SCALE LIKE A SNOWBALL TILL AT LAST A PUBLIC OPINION IN HARMONY WITH THE NEW TRUTH IS CREATED AND THEN THE WHOLE MASS OF MEN IS CARRIED OVER ALL AT ONCE BY ITS MOMENTUM TO THE NEW TRUTH AND ESTABLISHES A NEW SOCIAL ORDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT
EVERY DAY ONE BALANCES THE CHANCES OF WAR ON THE MORROW EVERY DAY THEY BECOME MORE MERCILESS
IF THE PEASANTS WHO NEED LAND TO MAINTAIN THEIR FAMILIES MAY NOT CULTIVATE THE LAND ABOUT THEIR HOUSES BUT ONE MAN A RUSSIAN ENGLISH AUSTRIAN OR ANY OTHER GREAT LANDOWNER POSSESSES LAND ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A THOUSAND FAMILIES THOUGH HE DOES NOT CULTIVATE IT HIMSELF AND IF A MERCHANT PROFITING BY THE MISERY OF THE CULTIVATORS TAKING CORN FROM THEM AT A THIRD OF ITS VALUE CAN KEEP THIS CORN IN HIS GRANARIES WITH PERFECT SECURITY WHILE MEN ARE STARVING ALL AROUND HIM AND SELL IT AGAIN FOR THREE TIMES ITS VALUE TO THE VERY CULTIVATORS HE BOUGHT IT FROM IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL THIS TOO COMES FROM THE SAME CAUSE
HE IS AGAIN TRANSFERRED IN COMPANY WITH CONVICTS BY ETAPE TO CAUCASUS AND THERE HE IS SHUT UP IN PRISON AND FALLS UNDER THE IRRESPONSIBLE POWER OF THE JAILER
TO PREACH TO MEN OF THE EVIL OF WAR AND THE BLESSING OF PEACE
EVERY MAN DURING HIS LIFE FINDS HIMSELF IN REGARD TO TRUTH IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WALKING IN THE DARKNESS WITH LIGHT THROWN BEFORE HIM BY THE LANTERN HE CARRIES
THE WHOLE TEACHING CONSISTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF TRUTH AND FOLLOWING IT IN A GREATER AND GREATER ATTAINMENT OF TRUTH AND A CLOSER AND CLOSER FOLLOWING OF IT IN THE ACTS OF LIFE
LET US LEAVE THEM TO CHERISH THE CHIMERA OF A GOLDEN AGE WHICH WOULD SOON BECOME IF IT COULD BE REALIZED AN AGE OF MUD
AND THIS CRIME IS PERPETRATED PUBLICLY AND NO ONE CRIES OUT TO THE DECEIVING AND THE DECEIVED
AND ABOVE ALL IT IS UNSAFE TO PART WITH THE SECURITY OF LIFE AFFORDED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT BUT THE TIME IS COMING WHEN ON ONE HAND THE VAGUE CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIS SOUL OF THE HIGHER LAW OF LOVE TO GOD AND HIS NEIGHBOR AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE SUFFERING RESULTING FROM THE CONTRADICTIONS OF LIFE WILL FORCE THE MAN TO REJECT THE SOCIAL THEORY AND TO ASSIMILATE THE NEW ONE PREPARED READY FOR HIM WHICH SOLVES ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS AND REMOVES ALL HIS SUFFERINGS--THE CHRISTIAN THEORY OF LIFE
AS THOUGH MEN WERE TO COMPLAIN THAT THOSE WHO ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF HANGMAN WERE--BY SOME STRANGE FATALITY--ALL PERSONS OF VERY LITTLE REFINEMENT OR BEAUTY OF CHARACTER
OR THAT AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL YOU ARE FORCED TO TAKE FROM THE POOR THEIR LAST PENCE FOR RICH MEN TO PROFIT AND SHARE THEM AMONG THEMSELVES
WE HAVE SEEN IT WAR
ANOTHER TO OMSK
THE SOCIALIZED MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY IS BROUGHT BY EXPERIENCE OF LIFE ITSELF TO THE NECESSITY OF ABANDONING THE PAGAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE WHICH IS INAPPROPRIATE TO THE PRESENT STAGE OF HUMANITY AND OF SUBMITTING TO THE OBLIGATION OF THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES THE TRUTHS OF WHICH HOWEVER CORRUPT AND MISINTERPRETED ARE STILL KNOWN TO HIM AND ALONE OFFER HIM A SOLUTION OF THE CONTRADICTIONS SURROUNDING HIM
IF ALL WERE AGREED THERE WOULD BE NO MORE WAR CERTAINLY AND NO NEED FOR ARBITRATION EITHER
IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THOUGHT YOU WILL PERISH JUST AS THE MEN PERISHED SLAIN BY PILATE OR CRUSHED BY THE TOWER OF SILOAM
THE MAJORITY OF MEN HAVING THE NON-CHRISTIAN VIEW OF LIFE ALWAYS STRIVE FOR POWER AND STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN IT
SOME OF THE LADS EMBRACE THEM AND WEEP WITH THEM OTHERS MAKE A SHOW OF COURAGE AND OTHERS TRY TO COMFORT THEM
SUCH A COMPETITION OF ITSELF INCREASES THE DANGER OF WAR
THIS METHOD IS AT THE SAME TIME VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICS I HAVE READ THE NATIONS OF EUROPE SPENT IN THE YEAR 1872 A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS STERLING ON PREPARATIONS FOR DECIDING DISPUTES BY MEANS OF MURDER
SOME OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN BOUGHT OVER SOME COULD HAVE BEEN DUPED SOME COULD HAVE BEEN OVERAWED AND THESE WHO COULD NOT BE BOUGHT OVER DUPED OR OVERAWED WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED AS CRIMINALS ENEMIES OF SOCIETY WOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED OR IMPRISONED AND THE CROWD WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT
ALL MEN OF THE MODERN WORLD EXIST IN A STATE OF CONTINUAL AND FLAGRANT ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THEIR CONSCIENCE AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE
WHO ARE THOSE WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH
IT RECOGNIZES THE DOCTRINE WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE THE BASIS OF LIFE IN THIS NEW PERIOD
BUT HE WHO ESTEEMS LIFE MORE THAN FULFILLING THE WILL OF GOD IS ALREADY DEAD TO THE ONLY TRUE LIFE
IT ALL AMOUNTS TO THIS
IT'S OPPOSED TO THE LAW OF CHRIST GO ALONG GO ALONG
THIS QUESTION WILL BE FINALLY DECIDED BEYOND APPEAL BY THE RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS OR CONSCIENCE OF EVERY MAN WHO IS FORCED WHETHER HE WILL OR NO THROUGH UNIVERSAL CONSCRIPTION TO FACE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE STATE IS TO CONTINUE TO EXIST OR NOT
BUT IS IT SO WITH US
WHEN CHARLES I
AND WHAT AN IMMENSE MASS OF EVIL MUST RESULT AND INDEED DOES RESULT FROM ALLOWING MEN TO ASSUME THE RIGHT OF ANTICIPATING WHAT MAY HAPPEN
SO THAT THEY ARE NOT ACTING THUS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ABSTRACT PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE
AND IT BECOMES EASIER FOR THEM TO GRASP IT AND AN INCREASING NUMBER ACCEPT IT
I KNOW THAT I HAVE NO NEED OF THE ADMINISTRATION OR OF COURTS OF JUSTICE FOUNDED UPON FORCE AND THEREFORE I CAN TAKE NO PART IN EITHER
I WILL NOT THINK ABOUT IT BUT WILL GO ON JUST AS I DID BEFORE
AND THEREFORE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE EXISTING ORDER ARE MISTAKEN IN ARGUING THAT SINCE EVEN WITH THE AID OF FORCE THE BAD AND NON-CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS OF HUMANITY CAN HARDLY BE KEPT FROM ATTACKING US THE ABOLITION OF THE USE OF FORCE AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF PUBLIC OPINION FOR IT WOULD LEAVE HUMANITY QUITE UNPROTECTED
THAT HE ROSE AGAIN ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND SITTETH ON THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER AND WILL COME IN THE CLOUDS TO JUDGE THE WORLD AND SO ON
BUT IT IS STILL MORE ASTONISHING THAT TWO OTHER BOOKS OF WHICH I HEARD ON THE APPEARANCE OF MY BOOK SHOULD BE SO LITTLE KNOWN I MEAN DYMOND'S BOOK ON WAR PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LONDON IN 1824 AND DANIEL MUSSER'S BOOK ON NON-RESISTANCE WRITTEN IN 1864
AND THEREFORE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF THEY FELT CALLED UPON TO WRITE ABOUT MY BOOK AT ALL THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT INEVITABLE BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE TO REPLY TO THE PRINCIPAL POINT OF MY CHARGE AGAINST THEM AND TO SAY PLAINLY DO THEY OR DO THEY NOT ADMIT THE TEACHING OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AND THE COMMANDMENT OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL AS BINDING ON A CHRISTIAN
A MONK PRESSED ON HIM ACCOUNTS OF RELICS HOLIDAYS MIRACULOUS IKONS A PSALTER ETC
AND THIS IS THE POSITION IN WHICH ALL THESE UNLUCKY RULERS MINISTERS MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT GOVERNORS GENERALS OFFICERS ARCHBISHOPS PRIESTS AND EVEN RICH MEN FIND THEMSELVES TO SOME EXTENT ALREADY AND WILL FIND THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER AS TIME GOES ON
NINETY-NINE PER CENT OF THE EVIL OF THE WORLD IS FOUNDED ON THIS REASONING--FROM THE INQUISITION TO DYNAMITE BOMBS AND THE EXECUTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POLITICAL CRIMINALS
THEY BROUGHT THEM FOUR TIMES BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS AND AT LAST DECIDED TO LAY THE MATTER BEFORE THE TZAR WHO GAVE ORDERS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN TO GEORGIA FOR CORRECTION AND COMMANDED THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO SEND HIM A REPORT EVERY MONTH OF THEIR GRADUAL SUCCESS IN BRINGING THESE PEASANTS TO A BETTER MIND HOW THE CORRECTION ENDED IS NOT KNOWN AS THE WHOLE EPISODE INDEED WAS UNKNOWN HAVING BEEN KEPT IN PROFOUND SECRECY
YE HAVE HEARD IT WAS SAID OF OLD AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
FROM THE PEOPLE LIVING ON HIS LAND AND ROBS THESE GENERALLY POVERTY-STRICKEN PEOPLE OF ALL HE CAN GET FROM THEM
RESIST NOT EVIL
ANOTHER CHAMPION OF NON-RESISTANCE HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED IN THE SAME WAY--THE AMERICAN ADIN BALLOU WHO LATELY DIED AFTER SPENDING FIFTY YEARS IN PREACHING THIS DOCTRINE
BUT IF IT IS SO AND WE ARE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT CHRISTIANITY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH GOVERNMENT THEN THE QUESTION NATURALLY PRESENTS ITSELF
AND ALL THE REASONING IN THE WORLD CANNOT MAKE THE MAN WHO HAS OUTGROWN THE GOVERNMENTAL FORM OF SOCIETY TAKE PART IN ACTIONS DISALLOWED BY HIS CONSCIENCE ANY MORE THAN THE FULL-GROWN BIRD CAN BE MADE TO RETURN INTO THE EGG-SHELL
E BETHINK YOURSELF OR YOU WILL BE RUINED
TO TERRIFY MEN WITH THE PROSPECT OF THE WICKED DOMINATING THE GOOD IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT IS JUST WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND IS NOW AND CANNOT BUT BE
BUT EVEN IF A MAN WANTS TO FORCE HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH JUST AS THEY ARE TAUGHT TO HIM THE UNIVERSAL DIFFUSION OF EDUCATION AND OF THE GOSPEL AND OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF RELIGION PRESENTS A STILL MORE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE TO HIS DOING SO
WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT OUR LIFE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THAT INDIAN WHO UNDERSTOOD CHRISTIANITY IN ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE WITHOUT ANY COMPROMISES OR CONCESSIONS WE NEED BUT LOOK AT THE SAVAGE BRUTALITIES OF WHICH OUR LIFE IS FULL TO BE APPALLED AT THE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WE LIVE OFTEN WITHOUT OBSERVING THEM
WHY DO MEN WHO ARE NOT OBLIGED TO DO SO AND GET NO FEE FOR IT DEVOTE LIKE THE MARSHALS OF NOBILITY IN RUSSIA WHOLE MONTHS OF TOIL TO A BUSINESS PHYSICALLY DISAGREEABLE AND MORALLY PAINFUL--THE ENROLLING OF CONSCRIPTS
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
MEN ON A LOWER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING WHEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH PHENOMENA OF A HIGHER ORDER INSTEAD OF MAKING EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THEM TO RAISE THEMSELVES UP TO THE POINT OF VIEW FROM WHICH THEY MUST LOOK AT THE SUBJECT JUDGE IT FROM THEIR LOWER STANDPOINT AND THE LESS THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MORE CONFIDENTLY AND UNHESITATINGLY THEY PASS JUDGMENT ON IT
THE CONGRESS EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE FINANCIAL REFORM ASSOCIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR SOCIETIES IN EUROPE AND AMERICA SHOULD UNITE IN CONSIDERING MEANS FOR ESTABLISHING EQUITABLE COMMERCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES BY THE REDUCTION OF IMPORT DUTIES
THESE PHILOSOPHIES OF LIFE ARE THREE IN NUMBER AND ONLY THREE NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE ARBITRARILY BROUGHT THE VARIOUS THEORIES OF LIFE TOGETHER UNDER THESE THREE HEADS BUT BECAUSE ALL MEN'S ACTIONS ARE ALWAYS BASED ON ONE OF THESE THREE VIEWS OF LIFE--BECAUSE WE CANNOT VIEW LIFE OTHERWISE THAN IN THESE THREE WAYS
I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS NOT EASY
THUS A MAN WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION HAS COMMITTED AN ACT CONTRARY TO THE TRUTH HE RECOGNIZES REMAINS NONE THE LESS FREE TO RECOGNIZE IT OR NOT TO RECOGNIZE IT
AND THE GREATER THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL LIFE AND MEN'S CONSCIENCE THE GREATER THE EXTENSION OF HYPOCRISY
SO THAT NOWADAYS THE WEALTHY CLASS AND MEN AT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT DO NOT CONSTITUTE AS THEY DID IN FORMER DAYS THE ELITE OF SOCIETY
NON-RESISTANCE IS SALVATION
RECONNAISSONS DONC QUE S'IL EXISTE UNE RELIGION OU UNE DOCTRINE QUI S'APPELLE CHRISTIANISME ELLE PEUT AVOIR SES HERESIES SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
IT IS OBVIOUS TOO THAT EVEN FOR THOSE BY WHOM IT WAS ACCEPTED IT WAS SO ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO ALL THEIR OLD VIEWS THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPREHENSIBLE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER AS SOME HUMORIST SUGGESTED TO MAKE A QUEEN OF INDIA-RUBBER AND WHAT GOOD TO US ARE THESE ARMIES WITH THEIR GENERALS AND BANDS AND HORSES AND DRUMS
IN THOSE DAYS IT NEVER STRUCK THE LANDOWNERS AND WEALTHY MEN WHO PROFITED BY THESE CRIMES THAT THE PRIVILEGES THEY ENJOYED HAD ANY DIRECT CONNECTION WITH THESE ATROCITIES
I DO NOT WANT TO AGREE WITH THESE SENSELESS NOTIONS OF NON-RESISTANCE
AND THE MORE THE MIRACULOUS WAS INTRODUCED INTO IT THE MORE THE DOCTRINE WAS STRAINED FROM ITS MEANING AND THE MORE OBSCURE IT BECAME
WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO PROMULGATE OUR VIEWS AMONG ALL PERSONS TO WHATEVER NATION SECT OR GRADE OF SOCIETY THEY MAY BELONG
BUT SINCE IT IS ON THE ARMY THAT THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT RESTS IT WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE ARMY AND THE USE OF THE ARMY IN WAR
