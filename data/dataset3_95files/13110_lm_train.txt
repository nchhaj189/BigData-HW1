AND YET--AND YET--OH YOU MUST BE LUCY
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE GIRL LUCY ROGERS NOR AM I PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HER I AM DECLARED BETH
SO THE GIRL SAW SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND WENT TO WORK
AFTER THE ORCHESTRA HAD FINISHED A SELECTION MR HOPKINS ROSE TO MAKE THE FIRST ARGUMENT AND WAS GREETED WITH CHEERS
YOU SEE HE'S A WELL KNOWN REPUBLICAN AND WHEN HE SIDES FOR HOPKINS HE'S BOUND TO CARRY MANY REPUBLICANS WITH HIM BUT THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHOM MR ANDREWS THOUGHT MIGHT BE INFLUENCED AND HE GAVE PATSY A LIST OF THEIR NAMES
IT'S LUCY
SHE ATE THE BON-BON AND WAS ASLEEP BEFORE SHE REALIZED IT EXCELLENT SAID THE DOCTOR
THIS IS ALL NEWS TO ME HE DECLARED
MOREOVER ELMHURST WAS THE ONE IMPORTANT ESTATE IN THE COUNTY AND THE SIMPLE HARD-WORKING FARMERS IN ITS VICINITY CONSIDERED JUSTLY ENOUGH THAT THE OWNER WAS WHOLLY OUT OF THEIR CLASS
IT'S THIS WAY YOU SEE
TOMORROW MORNING WE BEGIN WORK CHAPTER VI A GOOD START AT AN EARLY BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING PATSY ANNOUNCED THE PROGRAM FOR THE DAY
WILL BELIEVES SHE IS ALIVE TOO SHE SAID
HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS
THE BANK ALTHOUGH SMALL AND ONLY ONE STORY HIGH WAS THE MOST MODERN AND IMPOSING BUILDING IN THE VILLAGE
MR CUMMINGS WAS CALLED INTO THE MEETING AND HE DENIED THAT THE TRADING WAS BEING DONE WITH HIS CONSENT BUT DEFIANTLY REFUSED TO MAKE A PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT TO THAT EFFECT
IT IS REALLY DELIGHTFUL
WE CAN'T HOPE TO WIN IT OFTEN AND ESPECIALLY IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHY NOT LOOKS TO ME AS IF YOU'D BUNGLED THINGS HOPKINS
BUT I RUN THE CHANCT O SEEIN YE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DESPRIT STRAITS AN NELL ADVISED THAT I HEV A TALK WITH YE
WHATEVER GOWN THE GIRL WORE LOOKED APPROPRIATE AND BECOMING AND HER MANNER WAS AS DELIGHTFUL AS HER APPEARANCE
JUST WHAT I SAY KEN
SO THE GIRL WENT FROM ONE SHOP TO ANOTHER MAKING LIBERAL PURCHASES AND SEEKING FOR EVERY OPENING THAT WOULD ENABLE HER TO MAKE A CONVERT
IT WASN'T EASY TO MAKE A LIVING RUNNING A PAPER IN ELMWOOD AND IF THERE WAS ANY BUSINESS PENDING HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SECURE IT
LIKE ENOUGH SAID KENNETH GRIMLY
THE MAN HOPKINS DECLARED HE COULD NOT TRUST ME BECAUSE I HAD ONCE BEEN A THIEF AND I WONDERED IF HE COULD SPEAK TRULY
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE A SINGLE VOTE
NELL AN LUCY BOTH FELT THE DISGRACE OF THE THING BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A PUBLIC DISGRACE LIKE GOIN TO JAIL
ONLY A FEW DAYS OH WHEN I FIRST SAW HER I WAS STRUCK BY HER RESEMBLANCE TO MRS ROGERS CONTINUED THE GIRL
AND THIS SUBTLE FLATTERY WAS SO ACCEPTABLE THAT NOT ONE DECLARED OUTRIGHT THAT HE WAS FOR HOPKINS WHATEVER HIS PRIVATE VIEWS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE FARMERS ALL KNEW MR WATSON AND LIKED HIM
AT SIGHT OF MR MERRICK WHOM HE KNEW BY THIS TIME TO BE A FRIEND OF KENNETH FORBES STAYING AT ELMHURST THE POLITICIAN SCENTED SOME PENDING DIFFICULTY OR AT LEAST AN ARGUMENT AND WAS SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO DISMISS HIS MEN WITHOUT DELAY
THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER MANIA SHE WANDERED AWAY FROM HER HOME AND HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE
I CAN'T THANK YOU SHE SAID SO I WON'T TRY
IT'S A CRIME TO ALLOW THESE SIGNS TO FLAUNT THEMSELVES IN OUR PRETTIEST SCENES
SO GREATLY REFRESHED AND IN A QUIETER MOOD THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR DAYS THE YOUNG MAN DRESSED AND ENTERED THE HALL TO FIND HIS WAY DOWNSTAIRS
THE DAY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS AS SUNNY AND MILD AS HEART COULD DESIRE
AND YOUR STORE IS AS NEAT AND ATTRACTIVE AS CAN BE
HE WAS MODEST ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER SPEAKER MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER
THE FARMER CHUCKLED
MR HOPKINS WAS PUZZLED
LUCY DIDN'T TAKE IT YE KNOW
AND IF HE DID THAT HIS POLITICAL CAREER WAS ASSURED
WE'RE SO AGONIZIN POOR NELL THOUGHT WE ORTER GIT SOME O THE MONEY WHILE IT'S GOIN THE GIRL WAS MUCH AMUSED
NELL KNOWS THAT AN SHE ORTER CAME HERSELF
AND THEN SHE ASKED SOFTLY
IT--IT WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO ME THAT LIKENESS MISS DEGRAF I CAN WELL BELIEVE IT SAID BETH
ELIZA LAUGHED ONCE OR TWICE HER HEAD RESTING UPON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW YOUR STORY WE MEAN TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR GIRL
AND THEN SHE KNELT AND KISSED THE WOMAN UPON HER BROW
BUT WE WANTED SOME UV TH MONEY THAT'S BEING WASTED AN WE WANTED IT MIGHTY BAD WHY THET'S THE HARD PART UV IT MISS
HE SAID THE OBJECTION TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WAS ONLY A RICH MAN'S ARISTOCRATIC HOBBY AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY OF HONEST PEOPLE
WAS LUCY LIKE YOU OR DID SHE RESEMBLE HER FATHER ASKED BETH
ALL DAY THE TWO MEN SCRUBBED THE ROCKS FAITHFULLY ASSISTED AT ODD TIMES BY THEIR IMPATIENT EMPLOYER
MARTHA HAS SENT ME THIS PITCHER OF LEMONADE AND I DON'T CARE FOR IT
BY THE WAY YOU WON'T FORGET TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THOSE SIGNS I HOPE
OH I KNOW FORBES ALL RIGHT
BUT HE DIDN'T COUNT
BETH HAS TALKED WITH HER BUT I HAVE SCARCELY BEEN NEAR HER SINCE SHE CAME HERE YOU ARE WILLING TO COME I SHALL BE GLAD TO THE POET SAXE SAID MR BURKE WALKING THROUGH THE GAP BESIDE LOUISE HAS NEVER BEEN PROPERLY APPRECIATED BY HIS COUNTRYMEN ALTHOUGH SINCE HIS DEATH HIS VERSES ARE IN GREATER DEMAND THAN WHILE HE LIVED
AS FOR PATSY SHE WAS OFTEN TOLD IN THE TOWNS THAT A YOUNG GIRL OUGHT TO BE IN BETTER BUSINESS THAN MIXING UP IN POLITICS AND SHE WAS SENSITIVE ENOUGH ONCE OR TWICE TO CRY OVER THESE REPROACHES WHEN ALONE IN HER CHAMBER
SHE WAS BOLD AND UNABASHED WHERE LUCY WAS SHY AND UNASSUMING
WELL LUCY WAS A GENTLE SWEET COUNTRY GIRL OF LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN LIFE
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL YET
RAST IS TOO CLOSE-FISTED WHY AS FER THAT WAS THE REPLY THE THING IS DONE TO CATCH VOTES
THEY HAD ALL SPENT THE SUMMER WITH UNCLE JOHN AT MILLVILLE AND HAD ONLY RETURNED TO NEW YORK A FEW DAYS BEFORE
IT'S MERELY A PART OF THE POLITICAL GAME I'M AFRAID RAST SAID DR SQUIERS
YOU HAVE A DISAGREEABLE WAY OF MAKING REMARKS SIR AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LISTEN TO FOOLISH SPEECHES
I FELT I MUST STAND ALONE AND LET NO ONE SUSPECT
JAMES WAS SEATED IN THE BUGGY OUTSIDE ENGAGED IN RUMINATION
SO I NEEDED A LINEN MAID AND ELIZA WENT RIGHT TO WORK
SO MR BURKE FOR IT WAS THE DETECTIVE BADE HER GOOD-NIGHT AND TOOK HIS LEAVE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER HE HAD GONE THAT MARY HOPKINS REMEMBERED SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO ASK HIM HIS NAME
THEN SHE SAID
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TOMORROW
LATHAM WAS FIRST ON HIS ROUTE AND HE ENTERED THE DRUG STORE
YES CAME A FAINT REPLY
INSTEAD OF BEING PLUNGED IN GRIEF ELIZA IS HAPPY AND GAY RECKLESS OF CONSEQUENCES AND FULLY SELF-POSSESSED
THE MAN HAD ALREADY CASHED HOPKINS'S CHECK AND HE KNEW THE REPRESENTATIVE COULD NOT GET THE MONEY AWAY FROM HIM SO AFTER ALL THE DENTIST LOST NOTHING BY THE EXPOSURE
THIS SEEMS SURPRISING AT FIRST HE SAID AND PROVES HOW STARTLING AGGREGATE FIGURES ARE
BETH AND LOUISE WERE WITH KENNETH AT THE TIME AND WERE EAGER TO REMAIN DURING THE INTERVIEW SO THE YOUNG MAN WAS SHOWN INTO THE LIBRARY
I HAD NO WORRIES OR RESPONSIBILITIES AT ALL
AN WE DIDN'T HEV NEITHER OF EM OF COURSE NOT WELL TOM COME OVER THET NIGHT TO SEE LUCY HEARIN SHE WAS HOME AN WHO IS TOM THET'S TOM GATES HIM THET--BUT I'M COMIN TO THET MISS
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT--ALL MY FAULT
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING OF LUCY ROGERS MR BURKE NOT YET IS THERE NO TRACE OF HER AT ALL A SLIGHT TRACE--NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING SAID MR BURKE
AND PERHAPS I'M WRONG IN LETTING THIS THING WORRY ME
MR FORBES AND I FIRST SAW HER RIDING IN A BUGGY WITH MR HOPKINS
I DO NOT DOUBT THE GIRL WAS UNJUSTLY ACCUSED
THE LAWYER WHO HAD ALWAYS HAD AN AFFECTION FOR THE YOUNG MAN PERCEIVED THIS CLEARLY
HE TALKED FOR AN HOUR WITH THE GIRL GAVE HER EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS THRUST SOME MONEY INTO HER HAND AND THEN DROVE HER BACK TO THE BEND IN THE PATH WHENCE SHE QUICKLY MADE HER WAY UP TO THE GREAT HOUSE
THIS IS GATES CELL--THE BEST IN THE SHOP HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED
I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A WEEK YOU KNOW CAN'T SAY MR HOPKINS I'M SURE
HE PAID DOC SQUIERS AN GOT A RECEIPT AN GIV IT TO LUCY
AN I DON'T BELIEVE DAN DOES YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW MUCH MRS SIMMONS REPLIED THE GIRL
ONCE SAID THE MAJOR FROM BEHIND THE MORNING PAPER I WAS IN POLITICS MESELF
HER MOTHER IS BLIND AND HER FATHER OLD AND FEEBLE
OH HE'S AGIN PUTTING ADVERTISING SIGNS ON FENCES AND BARNS AND WANTS TO HAVE THEM PROHIBITED LIKE THE INFERNAL FOOL HE IS INDEED
I LIKED TO HEAR MY OWN VOICE AND IT PLEASED ME TO BE ABLE TO TALK EASILY AND WELL
O COURSE
KENNETH GREETED MR BURKE AND INTRODUCED HIM TO THE YOUNG LADIES WHO BEGGED TO REMAIN DURING THE INTERVIEW
HE HAD HOPED TO FIND MR MARSHALL A MAN OF SYMPATHY
WHAT DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS ELIZA PARSONS THANK YOU
GRATEFUL FELLOW AIN'T YOU--WHEN I LOANED YOU MONEY TO KEEP YOU FROM BANKRUPTCY YOU DID HOPKINS
THE DENTIST WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO SO JAMES DROVE PATSY TO TOWN WHERE THEY ARRIVED ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THIS MONDAY MORNING
RAST'S A GOOD WORKER
MR WARREN IN HE ASKED THE CLERK AT THE WINDOW
I'M TOM GATES SIR YES
IF MR FORBES IS ELECTED IT MEANS LIGHTER TAXES BETTER ROADS AND GOOD SCHOOLS
ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO VOTE ILLEGALLY WILL BE PROMPTLY ARRESTED THIS CAUSED MORE CHEERING FOR THE WORKMEN HAD SUSPECTED THAT THE NEW HANDS WOULD BE VOTED ILLEGALLY AND THEY WERE RELIEVED TO FIND THAT IT WAS A SQUARE DEAL ALL ROUND AS ONE OF THEM REMARKED WITH SATISFACTION
HE DROVE ALONG THE TURNPIKE FOR A TIME IN SILENCE
IT'S BUSINESS AND MR FORBES IS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE YOUR HUSBAND WITH HIM
SHE LAID IT ON THE MANTEL AN IT WAS GONE AN SHE SAID AS LUCY TOOK IT
AT THIS JUNCTURE WITH ELECTION BUT THREE WEEKS AWAY HE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM ASKING HIM TO SEND THE DRAG AND BAGGAGE WAGON TO THE NOON TRAIN
SHE LOOKED AT HIM SHARPLY
WE'VE ONLY BEEN BACK THREE DAYS AND THE SUNBURN STICKS TO ME LIKE A BURR TO A KITTEN PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE OULD RASCAL PATSY ADVISED THE MAJOR COMPOSEDLY
BETH'S HOME WAS IN OHIO BUT THERE WAS SO LITTLE SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE GIRL AND HER PARENTS THAT SHE WAS HAPPY ONLY WHEN AWAY FROM THEM
THAT IS A GOOD SHOWING FOR WE HAVE A WEALTHY DISTRICT
THIS IS MR BURKE MARTHA
BUT LUCY BROKE DOWN UNDER THE THING AN RAVED AN CRIED AN NUTHER NELL NER I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HER
YOU ELECTIONEER?"--A SLIGHT SMILE CURLED HIS LIPS
CONVERSATION WAS LOUISE'S STRONG POINT
WHEN SHE HAD GONE LOUISE RAN TO THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH BETH'S ROOM AND TO HER SATISFACTION FOUND BOTH HER COUSINS WITH KENNETH UNCLE JOHN AND MR BURKE SEATED IN A GROUP WHERE THEY MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID
IT WAS NECESSARY TO BREAK THE NEWS TO THE POOR BLIND WOMAN GENTLY BUT BETH'S NATURAL TACT STOOD HER IN GOOD STEAD
STOP--STOP--AND LET'S GO BACK NONSENSE BETH SAID THE BOY
SHE DIDN'T TAKE A TRAIN BECAUSE POOR LUCY HADN'T ANY MONEY--AND I'VE ASKED AT ALL THE STATIONS
LUCY WAS NEAR FRANTIC WITH GRIEF
YOU'RE OUR PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT
EVERY SCHEME KNOWN TO POLITICIANS MUST BE WORKED AND NONE KNEW THE INTRICATE GAME BETTER THAN HOPKINS
ONE IS THAT MR HOPKINS--MR ERASTUS HOPKINS YOU KNOW IS THE OTHER CANDIDATE AND A PERSON MUST VOTE FOR EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM DAN'S A FRIEND O RASTUS SAID THE WOMAN THOUGHTFULLY
LOUISE MADE THE PRELIMINARY ADDRESS AND ALTHOUGH HER VOICE WAS NOT VERY STRONG THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD
ADVERTISING IS THE LIFE OF EVERY BUSINESS AND TO FIGHT SUCCESSFULLY THE GREAT ARMY OF ADVERTISERS WHOSE BUSINESS IS THE LIFE-BLOOD OF OUR INSTITUTIONS IS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS IT IS ABSURD
GO AND GET IT AND LET ME ALONE
THEY'VE GOT TWO EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILES DOWN FROM THE CITY WITH MEN TO MAKE THEM GO AND THEY'RE SPENDING MONEY RIGHT AND LEFT THAT'S BAD SAID HOPKINS SHIFTING UNEASILY FOR I HAVEN'T MUCH TO SPEND MYSELF
HE EVEN ATTRIBUTED TO THEM MORE THAN THEY DESERVED FOR UNCLE JOHN'S TELLING ACTIVITIES WERE SO QUIETLY CONDUCTED THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY LOST SIGHT OF ENTIRELY BY MR HOPKINS
WHAT HE WISHED ESPECIALLY TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED THE DISTRICT FAITHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVE AND DESERVED THEIR SUFFRAGES FOR RENOMINATION
I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE MUCH INTERESTED IN ME SHE REPLIED BUT I NEED A FRIEND--INDEED I NEED A FRIEND MISS LOUISE I'M SURE YOU DO AT FIRST I THOUGHT I COULD DO WITHOUT ONE
AS FOR TOM GATES HE HAD BEEN SO HORRIFIED BY HIS MISTAKE THAT HE TRIED TO AVOID MEETING ELIZA AGAIN
IF WE WIN WE'LL PRESENT KENNETH OUR BILL AND IF WE FAIL I'LL HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF GETTING RID OF SOME OF THAT DREADFUL INCOME THAT IS SWAMPING ME THIS WAS ALWAYS UNCLE JOHN'S CRY
I HAVE TWO ALTERNATIVES TO ADVISE
THAT MEANT A GOOD DEAL WITH UNCLE JOHN AND PATSY KNEW SHE HAD INTERESTED HIM IN KENNETH'S TROUBLES
NOT YET COUSIN HE REPLIED
CLOSE-FISTED AND MISERLY AS HE WAS NO ONE KNEW SO WELL AS THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOW VALUABLE THIS POSITION OF REPRESENTATIVE WAS TO HIM IN A FINANCIAL WAY AND THAT BY WINNING RE-ELECTION HE COULD FIND MEANS TO REIMBURSE HIMSELF FOR ALL HE HAD EXPENDED IN THE FIGHT
I ENJOYED EATING AND SLEEPING
NOT A QUESTION WILL EVEN BE RAISED
TOM ALWAYS LOVED LUCY AN WANTED TO MARRY HER
A GIRL OF HER CHARACTER SENSITIVE TO A FAULT WOULD BE GREATLY SHOCKED TO FIND THE MAN SHE LOVED A CRIMINAL IT WAS FOR HER SAKE THAT IS A POOR EXCUSE
BUT I AIN'T BEATEN YET DOC
FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS THEY HAD CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO MORE PROMINENT PLACES UNTIL THE BARNS AND SHEDS AND THE VERY ROCKS WERE DAUBED WITH GLARING LETTERS ASKING US TO BUY THE MEDICINES SOAPS TOBACCOS AND OTHER WARES THE MANUFACTURERS WERE ANXIOUS TO SELL
LET US EXAMINE THESE FIGURES
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THE POLITICIAN WHO HAD RISEN FROM THE POSITION OF A POOR STABLE-BOY TO ONE OF AFFLUENCE TO SAVE HIS WIFE FROM THIS DRUDGERY
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF CROOKED POLITICIANS MR MARSHALL BUT THIS MAN IS TOO RECKLESS AND FOOLISH EVER TO BE A SUCCESS
SO HE IGNORED THE SPEECH MERELY SAYING
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
THE DENTIST'S RECEPTION ROOM WAS DIVIDED FROM HIS OPERATING ROOM BY A THIN WOODEN PARTITION AND AS PATSY WAS DECIDING WHETHER TO EMPLOY DR SQUIERS'S SERVICES OR NOT SHE HEARD HIGH WORDS COMING FROM BEHIND THE PARTITION AND THE VOICE WAS THAT OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS
I THINK IT WAS ROSIE--OR LUCY OR SOMETHING ANYHOW IT WASN'T ELIZA AND THAT I'LL SWEAR TO
IT WAS WHILE THEY WERE ABROAD A YEAR BEFORE THE TIME OF THIS STORY THAT THE BOY MET AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES AGAIN
I THINK SAID THE GIRL THAT MR WATSON GOT KEN INTO POLITICS FOR HE SURELY WOULDN'T HAVE UNDERTAKEN SUCH A THING HIMSELF
THAT'S GETTING IT DOWN PRETTY CLOSE BUT WE MAY AS WELL MAKE UP OUR MINDS WE'RE BEATEN IF WE DON'T VOTE THE MEN OVER AT THE MILL
TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ADDRESSING CIRCULARS OF INSTRUCTION TO THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE TO WORK AT THE POLLING PLACES
THEN CAME A REPORT FROM LONGVILLE IN JEFFERSON COUNTY
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT A HARD FIGHT AHEAD OF YOU
THIS TWENTY DOLLARS IS TO HELP YOU PAY EXPENSES
YOU WON'T LEARN MUCH FROM OLD WILL'S DESCRIPTION
ALL VISITS HAS TO BE MADE IN THE CELLS THEN HE DELIBERATELY LOCKED KENNETH AND BETH IN WITH THE FORGER AND RETREATED ALONG THE PASSAGE
AND IN TRUTH ALL THE GIRLS ENJOYED THEIR WORK IMMENSELY
HE'D NEVER SEEN HER TILL THAT MORNING WHEN SHE CAME HERE
TAKE THAT LOW CHAIR DEAR AND I'LL SIT HERE ELIZA OBEYED LOOKING WISTFULLY INTO THE FAIR FACE OF HER NEW FRIEND
IF HE EVER FORECLOSES AS HE WILL DO SOME DAY THOMPSON WILL BE RUINED
A LAW COULD BE PASSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE FORBIDDING THE DISPLAY OF ALL ADVERTISING SIGNS IN PUBLIC PLACES IN THIS COUNTY HE SUGGESTED
IT RELIEVED THE LONELINESS OF HER OCCUPATION
IF YOU ARE LUCY ROGERS YOU HAVE A SCAR THERE--A SCAR WHERE YOU BURNED YOURSELF YEARS AGO SHE SEEMED FRIGHTENED FOR A MOMENT
THAT MEANS WE'VE WON--AND WON IN A WALK SAID THE LITTLE MAN
I'VE TALKED WITH HIM THOMPSON IS REALLY A GOOD REPUBLICAN REPLIED MR ANDREWS THE HARDWARE MAN
THE YOUNG MAN IS GUILTY AND HE MUST SUFFER THE PENALTY IS THERE NO WAY TO SAVE HIM ASKED KENNETH
BUT THE MANAGER WAS AS COLD AS AN ICICLE
YET DR HOYT SPOKE RATHER DOUBTFULLY OF THE CASE IN HAND
ANYHOW IT ALL HELPS IN MY FIGHT AGAINST FORBES HE AGAIN RETURNED TO THE LIVERY OFFICE AND ASKED FOR A RIG
AN ANNOUNCEMENT OFFERING HIMSELF FOR RENOMINATION AT THE PRIMARIES
I WILL GO AT ONCE WITH MR FORBES'S PERMISSION CERTAINLY SIR SAID KENNETH
FOR HE WAS A THRIFTY MAN AND WATCHED HIS INVESTMENTS CAREFULLY
THE DENTIST WAS THOROUGHLY FRIGHTENED BUT DETERMINED NOW THAT THE CONSPIRACY WAS DEFEATED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD LED HIM TO THE CRIME SHOULD NOT ESCAPE IN CASE HE WAS HIMSELF ARRESTED
THE DETECTIVE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE RECITAL AND SEEMED SURPRISED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF THIS BEFORE
THIS WAS WHY HE HELD SEVERAL LONG CONFERENCES WITH HIS FRIEND MARSHALL THE MANAGER AT THE MILL
HE GOT THE NAME OF THE SIGN PAINTER ACCEPTED A GLASS OF BUTTERMILK AT THE FARM HOUSE AND THEN RODE SLOWLY HOME BY ANOTHER ROUTE SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO FACE THE SIGNS AGAIN
WHY SHOULD I BE USED AND ABUSED JUST TO ELECT ERASTUS HOPKINS I'D LIKE TO KNOW
I KNOW OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE AND THEY ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU SUPPOSE
BUT THAT MY HEART WAS DEAD
I HAVE FOUND HER I REGRET TO SAY INCLINED AT TIMES TO BE--AH--INVENTIVE PERHAPS THAT'S SO REMARKED UNCLE JOHN CARELESSLY
TELL ME SIR
BUT IT WILL BE BEST THAT WAY
EACH ONE OF EM BROUGHT A CARLOAD OF CLOTHES BUT THEY COULDN'T PHASE KENNETH IN THAT WAY
SO HE TOOK THE GIRLS TO EUROPE AND THE FOUR HAD A FINE ADVENTUROUS TRIP AS MAY BE IMAGINED
IT REACHED THE SPEAKER'S EAR AND HE HURRIEDLY RESUMED THE ORATION
I AM THE WIFE OF A POOR FARMER BEGAN THE WOMAN SPEAKING SOFTLY AND WITH SOME HESITATION BUT GAINING STRENGTH AS SHE PROCEEDED
THERE HAD BEEN NO LOSS OF DIGNITY BY ANY ONE OF THE THREE AND THEIR EVIDENT REFINEMENT AS WELL AS THEIR GENTLENESS AND GOOD HUMOR HAD UNTIL NOW PROTECTED THEM FROM ANY REPROACH
AND THIS HANDSOME SUM OF MONEY BELONGS TO THEM AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY
BE AS CHEERFUL AS YOU CAN AND LEAVE THE SEARCH TO US THE WOMAN SIGHED
WILL YOU HELP ME TO ESCAPE SHE LOOKED EAGERLY AT LOUISE AS SHE ASKED THIS PITIFUL QUESTION AND THE OTHER GIRL REPLIED SOFTLY
BUT I'M IN IT AND CAN'T GET OUT THAT'S WHAT RAST SAYS
THE NEXT DAY MR HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND-BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT WHICH WERE WORDED IN A WAY DESIGNED TO OFFSET ANY ADVANTAGE HIS OPPONENT HAD GAINED FROM THE LAWN FETE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY
HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL-BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
I THINK MISS AS TOM MEANT THET--EV'RY WORD UV IT
I'M SO GLAD KEN--SO GLAD
THE TWO THEN RETIRED TO PERFECT THEIR PLAN AND IN AN HOUR EVERY ARRANGEMENT WAS COMPLETE
NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT IT COST IN LABOR AND MATERIAL TO ERASE THOSE THREE SIGNS
I'LL PAY FOR A HUNDRED MR LATHAM AND YOU'LL SEE THEY GO TO THE RIGHT PERSONS OF COURSE
THE HONORABLE ERASTUS STILL INSISTED UPON MAKING THE ANTI-SIGN FIGHT THE PROMINENT ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THEY MUST REPLY FORCIBLY TO THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS MADE IN HIS LAST HAND-BILL
BUT THEY ARE NOT ALIKE EXCEPT IN LOOKS
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THIS CAMPAIGN
I'D LIKE TO AVOID IT IF I CAN PERHAPS IT MAY BE QUIETLY ARRANGED SAID THE LAWYER
HE WAS SILENT AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY
WHEN IT BECAME NOISED ABOUT THAT THE YOUNG OWNER OF ELMHURST NOW BARELY TWENTY-ONE HAD DETERMINED TO ENTER POLITICS AND ASKED FOR THE NOMINATION OF REPRESENTATIVE NO OTHER REPUBLICAN VENTURED TO OPPOSE HIM
THEY'RE NOT ARTISTS KEN
GO ON WITH YOUR PAINTING AND BE HAPPY
WHAT EXQUISITE ROSES MISS MERRICK
THE BEST BRAND MIND YOU MR LATHAM SAID THE GIRL
I'LL SERVE YOU FAITHFULLY SIR WE'LL TALK OF ALL THIS BY AND BY TOM REPLIED KENNETH KINDLY
HE WOULD RELINQUISH THE THREE SIGNS IN THE GLEN FOR A PAYMENT OF FIFTY DOLLARS EACH WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER COMPETING SIGNS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE
SO HE DROVE OVER TO ELMWOOD AND WAS FORTUNATE TO FIND MR HOPKINS IN HIS OFFICE AT HOME WHERE HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED INSTRUCTING HIS WORKERS IN THEIR DUTIES AT THE POLLS
TOM GATES SHRANK AWAY FROM HER AS IF HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
I SUPPOSE I AM BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE BUT WHAT MY LIFE WAS DURING PAST YEARS IS TO ME A SEALED BOOK
HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY MONEY OUT OF THE OFFICE
NOR DO I ADDED KENNETH
BUT MR HOPKINS STATES THAT YOU GIVE NOTHING IN RETURN FOR THIS ONE-QUARTER OF ONE PER CENT WHILE I CLAIM YOU PAY TREMENDOUSLY FOR IT
SOMEHOW SAID BETH I'VE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THAT LITTLE MAN WHY HE'S A DETECTIVE REPLIED UNCLE JOHN WITH A SMILE AND THE CHIEF BUSINESS OF DETECTIVES IS TO MAKE MISTAKES CHAPTER XVII MRS
ON THESE OCCASIONS MR HOPKINS USED THE SITTING-ROOM AS HIS OFFICE AND COMMITTEE HEADQUARTERS BUT THIS DID NOT MATERIALLY INTERFERE WITH HIS WIFE'S COMFORT AS SHE WAS USUALLY BUSY IN THE KITCHEN
WILL YOU SEE MARTHA HE ASKED AND HAVE HER GIVE TOM GATES A ROOM SHE WENT ON HER ERRAND AT ONCE AND GRADUALLY THE YOUNG MAN RECOVERED HIS COMPOSURE
SHE LOVED TO TALK AND ARGUE AND HER MANNER WAS SO CONFIDING AND GRACIOUS THAT SHE SELDOM FAILED TO INTEREST HER LISTENERS
SO PLEASE PASS THE SUGAR AND TRY TO BE SOCIABLE INSTEAD OF STARING AT ME AS IF I SCARED YOU TOM PASSED THE SUGAR BUT HE COULD NOT EAT NOR COULD HE TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THIS STRANGE GIRL'S PRESENCE
LET ME GO
SO THE OPERA HOUSE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR TWO DAYS THE ORCHESTRA HAD BEEN HIRED AND THE NEWS OF THE JOINT DEBATE HAD SPREAD FAR AND WIDE
VOTE FOR THE HON
I CAN'T FARM THE ROCKS CAN I
BUT I'LL DO SOMETHING--ANY KIND OF WORK--IF I CAN GET IT I NEED SOMEONE TO ASSIST ME IN MY CORRESPONDENCE SAID KENNETH
IT'S JUST SHOCKING HOW SUCH A LITTLE THING AS STOPPIN SMOKING WILL RILE UP A FELLOW
KENNETH DECIDED THAT HE WAS ILL AT EASE AND IN A STATE OF DOGGED SELF-REPRESSION
SOME OF THE BOYS ARE OUT FOR FORBES ALREADY HOPKINS NODDED BUSY WITH HIS THOUGHTS
THEN HE TURNED TO THE GIRLS
IF SHE HAS BEEN TELLING TALES THEY ARE UNTRUE
THE QUESTION OF FEES OR OF COMFORT WAS WHOLLY IGNORED BY THE SPECIALIST AT THE MOMENT
OF COURSE SAID KENNETH THE GIRL IS NOT LUCY ROGERS
I'M FROM BEYOND FAIRVIEW
I'M UNABLE TO DECIDE
SHE DOES THE MENDING AND TAKES CHARGE OF THE LINEN ROOM BETH THEN RELATED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY FIRST NOTICED ELIZA AND HOW THEY HAD DISCOVERED HER TO BE A SPY IN THE SERVICE OF MR HOPKINS
AND--AND I APPRECIATE IT ALL--VERY MUCH
BUT HE LOST ALL HOPE OF BEING LOVED AS HE LOVED ME AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT BROKE HIM DOWN
THEN THE CHILDREN SANG ANOTHER VERSE AS FOLLOWS
YOU'VE LED ME A DOG'S LIFE
THAT'S A GAIN OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THEY GAZED AT HIM IN SILENT WONDER
IF ONE SOWS PLENTY OF SEED SOME OF IT IS BOUND TO SPROUT WE CAN TELL BETTER AFTER ELECTION SAID MR WATSON
THEY SOLD THIS BREAKFAST FOOD TO THOUSANDS OF FARMERS TO GIVE THEM HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO HARVEST ANOTHER CROP OF OATS
ONLY HIS PENT-UP ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND NOW THAT IT WAS OVER HE WAS CHAGRINED TO THINK THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT HER SAID THE MAN LOOKING WITH ADMIRATION AT MRS HOPKINS
AREN'T WE UNCLE JOHN I'LL BET ON YOUR TRIO PATSY REPLIED HER UNCLE
HE'S AN IDIOT
HIS MILDNESS DISARMED MARY HOPKINS
I RAISED IT FORBES EH
SHE TOLD MR MERRICK OF THE MORTGAGE HELD OVER THOMPSON BY MR HOPKINS AND THE LITTLE MAN MADE A MENTAL NOTE OF THE FACT
HE COMES UP HERE EVERY SPRING AND PAINTS FENCES AN ROCKS PAYIN SPOT CASH FER TH PRIVILEGE OH I SEE THEN HE CONTRACTS WITH THE SOAP MAN AN THE MEDICINE MAN TO PAINT UP THEIR ADS
SHE ALWAYS RECOVERED IN TIME BUT FOR DAYS SHE COULD REMEMBER NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE--NOT EVEN HER OWN NAME
THEN HE'S A PROGRESSIVE FELLOW
TAINT EASY YE KNOW MISS TO SAY SOME THINGS AN THIS IS ONE O THE HARDEST HE BEGAN
SHE OPENED IT TO FIND A LITTLE LEAN MAN STANDING UPON THE PORCH
NOT THE TOWN PEOPLE
I SIMPLY MUST HAVE THOSE VOTES DOC RESUMED THE REPRESENTATIVE
IF HOPKINS WAS DRIVEN TO SUCH METHODS AS STUFFING BALLOT-BOXES HE MUST KNOW VERY WELL HE'S DEFEATED HE ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO DR SQUIERS SAID PATSY GAILY
IT COSTS A LITTLE TO RUN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ACKNOWLEDGED BETH
AND AND THE BAD MAN OBJECTS TO THE IDEA AND WON'T BE DEFEATED ADDED THE MAJOR
VOTE FOR FORBES AND THE COLUMNS WERE FULL OF ARTICLES AND PARAGRAPHS PRAISING FORBES AND DECLARING THAT HE COULD AND WOULD DO MORE FOR THE DISTRICT THAN HOPKINS
ABOVE THIS GROUP A GREAT BANNER WAS SUSPENDED READING
MRS HOPKINS A TIRED-LOOKING WOMAN IN A BEDRAGGLED MORNING WRAPPER WAS GETTING THE BREAKFAST
THE THREE COUSINS FIRST EXCHANGED INQUIRING GLANCES AND THEN TURNED THEIR EAGER EYES UPON THE BROAD CHUBBY BACK OF UNCLE JOHN WHO MAINTAINED HIS POSITION AT THE WINDOW AS IF DETERMINED TO SHUT OUT THE MORNING SUNLIGHT
IN THREE WEEKS THAT IS LONG ENOUGH IF WE GET TO WORK
HE THINKS HE OUGHT TO SHOW A LITTLE CORDIALITY TO THE MEN WHO VOTE FOR HIM AND HE SAID YOU WOULD KNOW JUST THE PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM TO LATHAM GASPED BUT HE ASSUMED AN AIR OF MUCH IMPORTANCE
ONCE THEY USED ONLY THE NEWSPAPERS THE LEGITIMATE CHANNELS FOR ADVERTISING
BY NO MEANS
BECAUSE HE'S A DEMOCRAT AND THE DISTRICT IS STRONGLY REPUBLICAN
SO EACH ONE SUSPECTED THE OTHER OF CULPABLE FOOLISHNESS IF NOT DOWNRIGHT RASCALITY
I'VE GOT TO GET STARTED
I'M GOING TO SEE MR MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
I'M MISS DOYLE MR FORBES'S COUSIN I'LL SEE THAT THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS CAMPAIGN MISS DOYLE
SHE WAS AN IRRITABLE OLD WOMAN AS KENNETH KNEW HER AND HAD NEVER SHOWN HIM ANY LOVE OR CONSIDERATION
MR HOPKINS HAD PICKED HER UP FROM THE PATH LEADING FROM THE REAR GATE OF THE ELMHURST GROUNDS AND SHE HAD GIVEN HIM ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE GIRL CAMPAIGNERS
NOW LOOK AT ELIZA PARSONS
AN HOW IS OUR LAD WHY HE'S GOT HIMSELF INTO A PECK OF TROUBLE
I WONDER IF WE HAVE HE SAID
KENNETH TURNED TO MR MERRICK
ONE MOMENT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS LUCY AND THE NEXT TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE GIRL WAS UNDRESSED AND PUT TO BED IN HER OWN ROOM AND THEN EVERYONE EXCEPT DR HOYT RETURNED TO ELMHURST
THEY CAN'T REALIZE ON APPEARANCES BUT THEY CAN USE THE MONEY THE SIGNS BRING THEM THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S ALL
AND FOR WISDOM SHE'S GOT SOLOMON BEAT TO A FRAZZLE DECLARED THE MAJOR TO UNCLE JOHN IN DISCUSSING HIS DAUGHTER'S CHARACTER
THE MAN'S GREATEST FAULT WAS HIS HABIT OF PUNNING REMARKED THE DETECTIVE WATCHING THE GIRL'S FORM AS HE DREW NEARER
SO HE MADE A PLAIN STATEMENT OF THE WHOLE MATTER AND SIGNED IT AND MR WATSON ASSURED SQUIERS IMMUNITY FROM ARREST PENDING GOOD BEHAVIOR
EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE
THAT WAS THE REASON SHE WENT AWAY
HOW'S THAT FOR A CHECKMATE THAT'S FINE REPLIED DR SQUIERS
SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED
THE FARMERS WERE TOO BUSY WITH THE HARVEST TO COME TO TOWN FOR TRADING EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS AND THE ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THE TWO DAILY TRAINS DID NOT CAUSE MORE THAN A RIPPLE OF EXCITEMENT IN THE VILLAGE
HE'S OUT'N THE RYE FIELD REPLIED THE WOMAN
TRY IT AND SEE OF COURSE SAID PATSY CHEERFULLY
I'LL TAKE YOU TO HIS CELL MYSELF
SHE HAD A NICE TALK WITH THE HARDWARE MAN AND HE GAVE HER MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD--THOSE IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO WIN FOR THEIR CANDIDATE
THE GRAFTER IS ALL TOO COMMON IN POLITICS AGAIN THE BOY FELL INTO A THOUGHTFUL MOOD
IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE DR SQUIERS WAS SHARPENING AND POLISHING HIS INSTRUMENTS
YET NO TWO OF THEM ARE EXACTLY ALIKE
IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH WHETHER IT'S HOPKINS OR SOMEONE ELSE EXCEPT THAT YOU BEING A PROMINENT MAN OWE IT TO THE COMMUNITY TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS ADDED THE LAWYER
PAH SAID UNCLE JOHN CONTEMPTUOUSLY
AND THEN DON'T CONGRATULATE ME BUT THE CAMPAIGN MANAGERS--THREE OF THE NICEST AND CLEVEREST GIRLS IN EXISTENCE YOU'RE RIGHT MY BOY DECLARED UNCLE JOHN
WON'T YOU DRINK A GLASS ELIZA NO THANK YOU SHE REPLIED SHAKING HER HEAD
YOUR CHILD DOUBTLESS BECAME MENTALLY CONFUSED WHILE UNDER THIS ROOF
BUT THOMPSON RAN AGAINST HIM ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET AND COULDN'T WIN HIS PARTY VOTE WHO'S THOMPSON THE GENERAL STORE KEEPER
THE GIRL'S TOO PERT AND FORWARD FOR ANYTHING
DON'T BE ALARMED
YOU HAVE DONE THIS MR FORBES WHY MISS DEGRAF AND I ASSISTED PERHAPS
MR WATSON HAD JUST FINISHED HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE DENTIST WHEN UNCLE JOHN PICKED HIM UP AT THE CORNER
BUT I MUST MAKE A BLUFF TO OFFSET THEIR DAYLIGHT CAMPAIGN SO AS NOT TO LOSE GROUND WITH THE FARMERS
HIS NATURE WAS MOODY AND HE HAD A TENDENCY TO BROOD IF LEFT MUCH TO HIMSELF
I IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO LUCY ROGERS DO YOU IMAGINE THAT LUCY WOULD TRY TO DECEIVE ME SIR ASKED TOM REPROACHFULLY
BUT THE LOOK THAT THIS GIRL GAVE ME WAS ONE THAT MY LUCY NEVER COULD ASSUME
SHE AIN'T RIGHT IN HER HEAD YE KNOW OR SHE'D NEVER A DONE IT
WELL I'M NOT GOING TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY EVEN TO PROVE MY SANITY
I'LL PAY YOU TWENTY DOLLARS A WEEK TO START WITH AND MORE IF YOU SERVE ME FAITHFULLY
SHE'D NEVER A LEFT US LIKE THIS IN TH WORLD
SQUIERS
THEN SHE DISAPPEARED IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT LEAVING A WORD OR MESSAGE FOR US WHICH WAS UNLIKE HER--AND WE'VE NEVER HEARD A WORD OF HER SINCE
BUT HE WAS EAGER TO QUESTION THE DETECTIVE
HE DID NOT LAUGH AT HIS OPPONENTS ANY LONGER
IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MR FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS
IT MUST BE THE GIRLS
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE A FLOCK OF SHEEP
THE VICTORY WAS CERTAINLY WITH THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND THE ELMHURST PEOPLE RETURNED HOME THOROUGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE JOINT DEBATE CHAPTER XVI A CLEW AT LAST THE SERVANTS AT ELMHURST ALL ATE IN A PLEASANT DINING ROOM WITH WINDOWS FACING A GARDEN OF GERANIUMS
IF YOU WANT TO BE UP AND DOING WE'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO OCCUPY YOUR MIND NO MR WATSON
WHENEVER HIS ACQUAINTANCES ASKED ABOUT HIS CHANCES FOR RE-ELECTION THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS WINKED LAUGHED AND DECLARED IT'S A REGULAR WALK-OVER WHO IS OPPOSING YOU ONCE ASKED A GRAY-HAIRED SENATOR OF MUCH POLITICAL EXPERIENCE WHO HAD MET MR HOPKINS AT LUNCHEON
YOUNG FORBES IS DEAD AGAINST ADVERTISING AND ADVERTISING IS THE LIFE OF A NEWSPAPER
THE NEGLECT WHICH KENNETH HAD SUFFERED AND HIS LONELY LIFE HAD INFLUENCED THE YOUTH'S TEMPERAMENT AND HE WAS FAR FROM BEING AN AGREEABLE COMPANION AT THE TIME AUNT JANE SUMMONED HER THREE NIECES TO ELMHURST IN ORDER TO CHOOSE ONE OF THEM AS HER HEIRESS
COME IN THE GIRL ENTERED AND GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY CRY OF SURPRISE
THE GIRLS HAD NOT BEEN TO THE HOUSE SINCE AUNT JANE'S DEATH TWO YEARS AGO AND AFTER A HASTY LUNCHEON THEY BEGAN AN INSPECTION OF EVERY ROOM AS WELL AS THE GARDEN GROUNDS AND STABLES
ELIZA AND I ARE FRIENDS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER AREN'T YOU GOING TO THE POLLS ASKED PATSY
OUT OF WHAT HIS TROUBLE IT SEEMS NOT
THE TOOTHACHE WAS ALL FORGOTTEN
MR HOPKINS SAW I WAS WHOLLY IRRESPONSIBLE AND RECKLESS AND HE DECIDED TO USE ME TO SPY UPON THE PEOPLE HERE AT ELMHURST AND REPORT TO HIM WHAT THEY SAID AND DID
A SUBTLE SYMPATHY SEEMED ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO
THEN THEY ALL LAUGHED
PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THESE THINGS SO LONG THAT THE MANUFACTURERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN COVERING EVERY BARN ROCK AND FENCE WITH THEIR SIGNS
SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE YOUTH WHO CONFRONTED HER
MOSTLY NELL CRIES NOWADAYS YES
FORTY MEN ARE SLEEPING IN A NEAR-BY BARN AND TWENTY-SIX IN THE STOCK-ROOM OF THE MILL ADDED MR BURKE
YES YES LAUGHED THE MAJOR DERISIVELY
HAVING BEEN BEATEN BY HOPKINS AT THE LAST ELECTION WHEN HE RAN AGAINST HIM ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET THOMPSON HAD NO DESIRE TO SEE FORBES MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN HE HAD BEEN HIMSELF
BUT THEY'VE ALL BEEN BOUGHT UP
SO HE EXHORTED THEM EARNESTLY TO KEEP THEIR HOMES BEAUTIFUL AND FREE FROM THE DEGRADATION OF ADVERTISING AND NEVER TO PERMIT GLARING COMMERCIALISM TO MAR THE SCENERY AROUND THEM
ALL THEM SECRET CONFABS AN TRICKERY TO WIN VOTES CAN'T BE ON THE SQUARE
IT MEANS THE ELECTION
THE WORLD FORGETS THESE THINGS SOONER THAN YOU SUPPOSE HE ANSWERED
WE ANSWERED LOUISE LIFTING HER BROWS AND MAKING A PRETTY GESTURE
I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM TELLING YOU THIS
DO YOU SUPPOSE I'D RISK STATE'S PRISON MYSELF IF I WASN'T SURE LOOK HERE RAST SAID SQUIERS DOGGEDLY YOU'RE MAKING A TOOL OF ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN
BUT WHEN KENNETH FORBES RECEIVED THE NOMINATION ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET HE FELT THAT ALL WAS OVER BUT THE SHOUTING AND THAT HE WOULD WIN IN A WALK HAD IT BEEN AN ISSUE BETWEEN THE PERSONALITY OF THE TWO MEN HOPKINS WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS
WELL SHE CRIED EAGERLY DID YOU HEAR
BUT I'M AFRAID OF IT
IT WON'T BE EASY YOU KNOW
ABOUT SIXTY-SIX MILL HANDS THE CAT WAS OUT OF THE BAG NOW
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO DO WITH MR SIMMONS AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED YOUR HELP
HOW MUCH DOC HE INQUIRED
I--I'M ROGERS MISS
THE PHYSICIAN SAT LATE IN CONVERSATION WITH THE BLIND WOMAN AND OLD WILL AND WHEN THEY RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT HE LAY DOWN UPON A LOUNGE IN THE LITTLE LIVING-ROOM
HE HAD NOT MUCH APPETITE FOR BREAKFAST WHEN MRS HOPKINS SET IT BEFORE HIM
WITH THIS SECOND ADVERTISING COMPANY HE MET WITH MORE DIFFICULTIES AND MR WARREN HAD TO COME TO THE TELEPHONE AND ASSURE THE MAN THAT MR MERRICK WAS ABLE TO PAY ALL HE AGREED TO AND THAT THE MONEY WAS ON DEPOSIT IN HIS BANK
I HAD ON A SIMPLE GRAY DRESS WITH NO HAT
TAINT LIKE OUR LUCY KENNETH HAD TURNED AROUND ON HIS STOOL AND WAS REGARDING OLD WILL ROGERS EARNESTLY BRUSH AND PALLET ALIKE FORGOTTEN
THEN THE WORDS OF LOUISE BEGAN TO SOUND DREAMY AND INDISTINCT IN HER EARS
THE MEN WERE IN CHARGE OF HUGE CANS OF PAINTS ASSORTED BRUSHES LADDERS SCAFFOLDS AND OTHER PARAPHERNALIA
IT'S IMPORTANT TO WIN THESE PEOPLE SHE DECLARED BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSE TO EVERY FARMER WHO COMES TO TOWN TO TRADE
YOU--YOU MUST FORGIVE ME MR FORBES HE SAID PENITENTLY
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SIR CONSIDERABLE IF YOU'RE DISPOSED ANSWERED THE OTHER
BUSINESS IS PRETTY LIVELY THESE DAYS AND IT KEEPS ME HUSTLING
KENNETH INTERVIEWED MR WEBB AND FOUND THAT HE RECEIVED NO MONEY FOR THE SIGN
HE'S AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER HE RUINED ANY GOOD EFFECT MY SPEECH MIGHT HAVE CREATED SAID KENNETH GLOOMILY
AND THEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND IN CAME TWO GIRLS WHOSE BRIGHT AND EAGER FACES MIGHT WELL WARRANT THE WARM WELCOME THEY RECEIVED
I'LL BET THE BAD MAN IS SCATTERING MONEY IN EVERY DIRECTION
HOW DID YOU LEAVE YOUR BROTHER HARRY AND HAVE YOU HEARD FROM JOSEPHINE LATELY THE GIRL GAVE HIM A STARTLED LOOK AND SHRANK BACK
THE LAWYER HAD ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO FOR HE HAD SECURED A PAPER EXONERATING LUCY ROGERS AND ANOTHER INCRIMINATING THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS AS WELL AS THE SIXTY DOLLARS PAID BY TOM GATES
LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD-WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
I LAUGHED AT HIM AT FIRST FOR IT SEEMED VERY ABSURD AND I DO NOT WANT HIM TO LOVE ME
I HAD TO MAKE MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE SHE ADDED WITH ONE OF HER BRIGHT LAUGHS
I PROMISE TO KEEP YOUR SECRET DEAR SHE SAID EARNESTLY
BUT I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN UNCLE JOHN WOULD DO THAT YOU HAVE MY AUTHORITY TO WIRE THE PHYSICIAN IF NECESSARY OR TO GO TO ANY EXPENSE YOU DEEM ADVISABLE CONTINUED MR MERRICK TURNING TO THE DETECTIVE
WE HAVE EIGHTEEN SURE MAJORITY AND PERHAPS MORE IT'S LIKELY TO BE MORE PREDICTED UNCLE JOHN
WE'LL WIN THE MEN BACK AGAIN BUT THESE GIRLS ARE RIDING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TALKING TO FARMERS WIVES AND THEY'RE ORGANIZING A WOMAN'S POLITICAL CLUB
OF COURSE NONE OF THE NEW MEN WHO WERE NOT PROPERLY REGISTERED HAVE A RIGHT TO VOTE AT THIS ELECTION AND I COMMAND THEM TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE POLLS
AT ALL HAZARDS HE WAS RESOLVED TO ELIMINATE THOSE UGLY SIGNS
FOR YOU SACRIFICE THE PRIVACY OF YOUR HOMES AND LANDS AND LEND YOURSELVES TO THE SELFISH DESIRE OF ADVERTISERS TO USE YOUR PROPERTY TO PROMOTE THEIR SALES
THEN COME THE TROUBLE MISS
YOU'LL WIN MRS SIMMONS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SAVING THE ELECTION FOR US
IT'S ALL UP WITH YOU MY BOY AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN
IN KENNETH'S BUGGY TO THE TOWN AND DURING THE FIVE-MILE DRIVE PATSY COUNSELED GRAVELY WITH HER SHREWD UNCLE IN REGARD TO WAYS AND MEANS THIS THING REQUIRES PROMPT ACTION PATSY HE SAID AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT COUNT THEY'VE GOT TO BE DONE ON A BIG SCALE TRUE SHE ADMITTED
THEN THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS QUICK TO CATCH THE LACK OF SYMPATHY IN THE AUDIENCE STOOD UP AND BEGGED LEAVE TO REPLY TO YOUNG FORBES
HE WANTS TO BEAUTIFY THE FARM PLACES BY DOIN AWAY WITH SIGNS AN HE WANTS BETTER ROADS AN THREE NEW SCHOOL-HOUSES CAUSE THE ONES WE'VE GOT NOW AIN'T BIG ENOUGH
SOMETIMES THE FARMER HIMSELF WAS AROUND THE HOUSE AND THEN THEY HELD A SORT OF CONFERENCE
HE SAID HIS LUCY HAD A SCAR ON HER LEFT ARM AND THAT MADE ME AFRAID BECAUSE I HAD DISCOVERED A SCAR ON MY OWN ARM
THIS MAN HOPKINS SAID MR WATSON ANGRILY IS NOT A GENTLEMAN
WHICH OF YOU YOUNG LADIES HAS WON THE FRIENDSHIP OF LUCY ROGERS HE ASKED
THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COPE WITH SUCH A THRONG HE ALLOWED LOUISE TO IMPRESS SEVERAL FARMERS DAUGHTERS INTO SERVICE AND WAS ABLE TO FEED EVERYONE WITHOUT DELAY AND IN AN ABUNDANT AND SATISFACTORY MANNER
YE MUSTN'T MIND ME MISS SAID WILL ROGERS IN A DEPRECATING TONE
YET THEY WERE THE SAME EYES
SOME OF THEM WERE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO ADMIRE THE YOUNG QUIXOTE AND ACKNOWLEDGED FRANKLY THAT IT WAS A PITY TO DECORATE THEIR PREMISES WITH SIGNS OF PATENT MEDICINES AND QUESTIONABLE SOAPS
EVERYTHING OUT MR HOPKINS
SHE'S THE LIVING IMAGE OF MRS ROGERS
IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT LATHAM HAD CHANGED FRONT
SHE IS DOING THE WORK OF AN EXPERIENCED SPY WHILE ANY DECEIT WAS FOREIGN TO LUCY'S NATURE
SHE SMILED SWEETLY UPON THE DRUGGIST WHEN HE BOWED HER OUT AND MR LATHAM FROM THAT MOMENT BEGAN TO SEEK FOR FRIENDS OF MR FORBES TO GIVE CIGARS TO
OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT PRACTICING THEIR MUSIC-LESSONS GOOD EXCLAIMED SHREWD MISS PATSY WHEN SHE READ THIS CIRCULAR
MR HOPKINS WAS NOTICEABLE BY HIS ABSENCE AND THIS WAS DUE NOT SO MUCH TO HIS COWARDICE AS TO AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT
THESE FARMERS SEEM VERY HONEST DECENT FELLOWS THEY ARE KEN
HE MET KENNETH FACE TO FACE AND THE LATTER SAID PLEASANTLY
AND I HAVEN'T GOT NO USE FOR HIM NEITHER ARGUMENT WAS USELESS IN THIS CASE
I'LL COME AND GET YOU THEN
WAITING FOR MR FORBES SIR ASKED TOM
WHY SHOULD I GO
I'LL ATTEND TO THAT SAID LOUISE QUICKLY
THEN WE THOUGHT TH TROUBLE WAS OVER BUT IT HAD ON'Y JUST BEGUN
PROBABLY MR MARSHALL THE MANAGER OF THE MILL WILL GO WITH THEM OH I DON'T LIKE THAT EXCLAIMED PATSY
THE FIRST REPORT WAS FROM ELMWOOD AND SHOWED A GAIN OF SEVENTEEN OVER THE ESTIMATE
ERASTUS LOOKED AT HIS VISITOR TREMBLINGLY ALTHOUGH HE TRIED TO CONTROL HIS NERVES
HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BY HIMSELF IN A SHORT TIME
AS REGARDS THE ADVERTISING SIGNS CONTINUED THE GIRL I'VE HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF AS A MAN OF EXCELLENT TASTE AND I CAN BELIEVE IT SINCE I'VE EXAMINED THE CLASS OF GOODS YOU KEEP
THAT'S ALL TOM FLUSHED REMEMBERING HIS RECENT CRIME
BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON A BROAD AND LIBERAL BASIS I ASSURE YOU AND WE NEED MONEY SPEND ALL YOU LIKE THEN SO LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY TO CORRUPT THE VOTERS VERY GOOD
I'VE TRIED TO HIDE IT ALL SO CAREFULLY
BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE ACTED VERY FOOLISHLY DO YOU KNOW LUCY SIR ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
BUT FOR MERCY'S SAKE DON'T BLEED ME ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP
BUT THIS ANTI-SIGN ISSUE BADE FAIR TO RUIN ALL HIS CHANCES
YES SIR I'VE BEEN BOTHERED ALREADY OVER YOUR ELECTION CAMPAIGN RESUMED THE MANAGER ARRANGING HIS PAPERS IN A BORED MANNER
YOU'LL FIND THIS SORT VERY NICE ELIZA HESITATED BUT FINALLY REACHED OUT HER HAND AND TOOK THE BON-BON
HE WON'T PUT UP ENOUGH OF A FIGHT TO MAKE IT INTERESTING I'M AFRAID MR HOPKINS CONFIDED TO HIS CRONIES
BUT IT WAS ONLY A BUBBLE AFTER ALL AND AS SOON AS WE PRICKED IT--IT DISAPPEARED CHAPTER XXI THE RETURNS FROM FAIRVIEW ELECTION DAY DAWNED SUNNY AND BRIGHT
THAT MAY BE TRUE ADMITTED BETH
IF MR HOPKINS IS ELECTED IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING GOOD EXCEPT FOR MR HOPKINS I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT LAUGHED THE WOMAN
BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY DRIVE OUT ONE AND ANOTHER WILL TAKE HIS PLACE
HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO HIS LAWYER DIRECTING HIM TO WITHDRAW THE PROSECUTION
EVERYONE KNEW HIM WELL BY SIGHT YET KENNETH COULD NOT HAVE NAMED MANY OF HIS NEIGHBORS HAVING HELD LITTLE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM
I NEVER DRINK LEMONADE THEN HAVE ONE OF THESE SANDWICHES I'M NOT HUNGRY MISS LOUISE LOUISE SIGHED
HER MANNER WAS A LITTLE DEFIANT AT FIRST BUT WHEN LOUISE DREW HER UNOBSERVED TO THE SIDE ENTRANCE AND UP THE STAIRCASE SHE GREW GENTLE AND PERMITTED THE OTHER GIRL TO TAKE HER ARM
LOUISE LAY BACK IN HER CHAIR AND CLOSED HER EYES FEARING THEIR EAGERNESS MIGHT BETRAY HER
WHAT'S ALL THIS PLUGGING FOR FORBES MEAN THOMPSON GAVE HIM A SOUR LOOK OVER THE TOP OF HIS DESK
JOHN MERRICK OWNS THE SPACES NOW AND WE'RE WORKING FOR JOHN MERRICK WHO'S HE SOME FRIEND OF MR FORBES UP AT ELMHURST MR HOPKINS WAS NOT A PROFANE MAN BUT HE SAID A NAUGHTY WORD
TWO PEOPLE HAVE NEVER LIVED THAT WERE SO NEAR ALIKE AS YOU AND LUCY ROGERS INDEED WILL YOU SHOW ME YOUR LEFT ARM NO SHE WAS AGAIN STUDYING HIS FACE
AN THESE ERE SIGNS PAYS ME TEN DOLLARS A YEAR EACH KENNETH GROANED
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT IN KENNETH SAID UNCLE JOHN SOBERLY
BUT I DON'T LOOK FOR MUCH TROUBLE FROM A PARCEL OF GIRLS MR HOPKINS WAS QUITE CHEERFUL BY THIS TIME FOR HE HAD THOUGHT OUT THE SITUATION AND HIS FIGHTING BLOOD WAS UP AS HE EXPRESSED IT
YES SIR AND ARE STILL UNABLE TO DECIDE WHO SHE IS THAT'S IT SIR
HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENOUNCE THE MAID AT ONCE AND HAVE HER DISCHARGED
IT WAS SIGNED BY JOHN MERRICK AND THE BOY WAS OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING HIS JOLLY OLD FRIEND AGAIN
I'D LIKE TO MEET HER IN SOME WAY THAT WOULD SEEM ACCIDENTAL AND NOT STARTLE HER THAT IS RATHER A HARD THING TO ARRANGE MR BURKE SAID THE BOY WITH A SMILE
WOMEN IN POLITICS OBSERVED THEIR UNCLE HAVE OFTEN BEEN A TREMENDOUS POWER
NOT NOW
THEREFORE THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE THEN FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATE OF THE MONEY PAID THE FARMERS OF THE DISTRICT BY THE ADVERTISERS DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE
HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME ELIZA SHE SEEMED A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT ANSWERED PROMPTLY
CHAPTER XIV LUCY'S GHOST KENNETH HAD SENT WORD TO TOM GATES ASKING THE YOUNG MAN TO COME TO ELMHURST BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER THE LAWN PARTY THAT TOM APPEARED AND ASKED PERMISSION TO SEE MR FORBES
BUT TO AMUSE YOU MISS LOUISE MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT BUT THE GIRLS FOUND A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN THE ELECTION IN WHICH ELIZA WAS MUCH INTERESTED AND THEY CHATTED TOGETHER FOR AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE LOUISE MADE ANY MOVE TO CONSUMMATE HER PLOT
A THIN-FACED MAN WITH SHARP EYES WAS TALKING WITH THE PROPRIETOR
HAVE IT PULLED OR FILLED OR SOMETHING HE SAID
JOHN BURKE A DETECTIVE THE MANAGER HESITATED A MOMENT
LISTEN OH TELL US ABOUT IT LASSIE SAID THE MAJOR
EV'RY MAN JACK'S AGIN THE FOOL NOTION THEN PERHAPS THE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FORBES HAS GIVEN UP ALREADY CONTINUED HOPKINS LAUGHING AT THE RECOLLECTION
I'VE MET YOU BEFORE SOMEWHERES HAVEN'T I YOU HAVE SIR GLAD YOU'RE HERE FORBES
THEY DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD REMARKABLE TALENT AS AN ARTIST AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO DRAW AND PAINT SOMETHING HE HAD LONG LOVED TO DO IN SECRET
HERE WAS AN INTERESTING ADVENTURE FOR A FACT
HONEST INJUN I'M AFRAID WHAT ARE YOU FRAID OF
I'LL GET THE MONEY LUCY
YOU'VE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT YOUR BELONGINGS JUST NOW
IT'S IMPORTANT OR I WOULDN'T DISTURB YOU WELL THEN
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT COUNT AFTER ALL
SUDDENLY IT STRUCK THE YOUNG MAN THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE DETECTIVE WHO CALLED EVERY EVENING TO GIVE HIS REPORT AND IF SO TOM WAS ANXIOUS TO TALK WITH HIM
GIVE IT UP MY BOY ADVISED THE ELDER MAN LAYING A KINDLY HAND ON THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER
AND HE COULD FIND A WAY TO EVEN SCORES WITH THE LITTLE DRUGGIST LATER
SO MR MERRICK HAD BEEN REVOLVING THE POSSIBILITIES OF THIS UNIQUE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN HIS MIND AND HAD DECIDED TO DO SOME THINGS THAT WOULD OPEN THE BUCOLIC EYES OF KENNETH'S CONSTITUENTS IN WONDER
WANT TO SEE TOM GATES EH
SEE HERE DOC I HAD AN IDEA SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN AND SO I ARRANGED WITH MY BREAKFAST FOOD COMPANY TO LET ME PAINT A HUNDRED SIGNS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
BUT MARK YOU SIR
WHY IT'S ALL ARRANGED IN ADVANCE MR LATHAM AND THE BETTER ELEMENT LIKE YOURSELF IS SURE TO SUPPORT HIM
THE BARNS AND FENCES ALL SEEMED NEWLY PAINTED AND HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HADN'T SEEN AN ADVERTISING SIGN SINCE HE LEFT TOWN
HAS HE ANY POLITICAL INFLUENCE ASKED THE GIRL
SUCH THINGS OUGHT NOT TO BE PERMITTED THE PEOPLE THINK DIFFERENTLY HE REPLIED
IS MARSHALL TO BE TRUSTED HE ASKED
I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
YOU'RE TO STAY AT HOME AND WRITE SEVERAL ARTICLES FOR THE NEWSPAPERS
I'M DISGRACED FOR LIFE
BUT HE LET LOUISE DO THE TALKING AND WAS MUCH PLEASED AT THE TACT AND GOOD NATURE SHE DISPLAYED IN DEALING WITH THE WIDELY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHARACTER SHE ENCOUNTERED
HE HAD USURPED THE POSITION OF DEMOCRATIC LEADER IN HIS COMMUNITY AND THE OTHERS WERE AFRAID TO ANTAGONIZE HIM OPENLY
AFTER BREAKFAST UNCLE JOHN ORDERED HER TO DRIVE TO TOWN AND SEE A DENTIST
AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN ABSENT A WEEK
HERE'S FAIRVIEW AT LAST THEY HELD THEIR BREATHS AND WATCHED HIS FACE
JUST HELP US AS MUCH AS YOU CAN THE OLD MAN STRAIGHTENED UP AND HIS EYES FILLED AGAIN
OUR DISCOVERY OF IT WILL SEND BOTH ERASTUS HOPKINS AND DR SQUIERS TO PRISON
THAT ISN'T CRIMINAL SIR NO INDEED
SHE IS AT PRESENT PLUNGED INTO A DEEP SLEEP UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NARCOTICS THAT HAVE RENDERED HER BRAIN ABSOLUTELY INACTIVE
JUST NOW YOU MUST HAVE SOME SLEEP AND GET YOUR STRENGTH BACK
ARE YOU WILLING TO KEEP IT UP LOUISE OF COURSE SHE EXCLAIMED
I'M LAUGHED AT AND REVILED A SUBJECT FOR CONTEMPTUOUS JEERS AND--AND IT HURTS ME
HERE INDEED WAS INFORMATION OF A STARTLING CHARACTER
TELL ME WHAT THESE FOOL GIRLS ARE UP TO THAT ARE PLUGGING FOR FORBES
I THOUGHT I'D FOUND HER DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY YES THERE WAS LITTLE INTEREST IN THE TONE
SOME OTHER TIME GIRLS ANSWERED THE BOY RED AND DISTRESSED
YES A LOT
SHE'LL FORGET ME BEFORE I'VE SERVED MY TERM AND--AND TAKE UP WITH SOME OTHER YOUNG FELLOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT ASKED BETH
COME ALONG SAID KENNETH WITH SUDDEN RESOLVE
WHAT ARISTOCRATIC NOTION COULD PREVENT HIM
CHAPTER XIII THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM
HE'S HONEST AND TRUE MR FORBES--HE IS INDEED I THINK SO SAID KENNETH
SO SHE WAS RATHER SURPRISED WHEN A TIMID KNOCK SOUNDED UPON THE DOOR
I'M GUILTY YOU KNOW AND THERE'S NO ONE TO BLAME BUT MYSELF THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
I MEAN TO WIN THAT EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED CHAPTER VII PATSY MAKES PROGRESS MEANTIME PATSY WAS IN THE THICK OF THE FRAY
BUT THE GIRL LAUGHED AT ME AND MADE SUCH SILLY SMILES AT RAST THAT HE TOLD ME TO SHUT UP CAUSE HE HAD A USE FOR HER IN POLITICS WELL WELL REPEATED THE VISITOR
HE HAS NEEDED MONEY AT TIMES AND BORROWED IT OF HOPKINS AT A HIGH RATE OF INTEREST
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN A HARD FIGHT AND EVEN THE MOST STURDY REPUBLICAN WAS INCLINED TO FEAR THAT THE PRESENT INCUMBENT OF THE OFFICE WOULD BE ELECTED TO SUCCEED HIMSELF
LUCY AND I HAVE BEEN SWEETHEARTS FOR YEARS AND I KNOW EVERY EXPRESSION OF HER DEAR FACE
THE MAID CAME AT ONCE TO ALL APPEARANCES AS HAPPY AND CARELESS AS EVER
THEY'RE OVER AT THE MILL
OH YOU NEEDN'T RAVE AT ME RAST HOPKINS JUST CAUSE YOU'RE GETTIN LICKED
I WAKENED ONE MORNING LYING BY THE ROADSIDE AND SHIVERING WITH COLD
THE VISITOR SAT SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HE HAD LEARNED ALL THAT THE POOR GOSSIPING WOMAN COULD TELL HIM
THERE'S BEEN CONSIDERABLE TALK ABOUT THIS SIGN BUSINESS AND I'M TOLD THAT AT THE MEETING LAST NIGHT ONE OF THE GIRLS MADE A SPEECH ABOUT IT AND SAID THE FARMERS WERE BEING CONVERTED AND WERE NOW STANDING OUT FOR CLEAN FENCES AND BARNS THAT'S ALL HUMBUG I THINK SO MYSELF
YET HERE ACROSS THE FIRST PAGE WERE BIG BLACK LETTERS SAYING
THE LITTLE MILLIONAIRE ALTHOUGH A MAN OF SIMPLE AND UNOBTRUSIVE WAYS WAS A SHREWD JUDGE OF HUMAN NATURE
OH HE'S IMPOSSIBLE
BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO BE AWAKENED BECAUSE IT WAS YET SO EARLY
I WAS GLAD TO HAVE WORK TO OCCUPY ME--AND THAT WAS ALL
YOU WOULDN'T CATCH HOPKINS GIVING ANYTHING AWAY REMARKED ONE FARMER TO ANOTHER
BUT KENNETH'S A BRIGHT LAD AND A BIG GUN IN HIS COUNTY
THEN WE MUST EDUCATE THE PEOPLE TO A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ANNOUNCED LOUISE
HE SAYS SO HIMSELF ANSWERED PATSY
HAVE YOU ANY CONFECTIONERY OR BON-BONS AT HAND YES INDEED
IT WAS FOOLISH AND CRIMINAL
VERY MUCH MISS
HELLO ARCHIE HELLO RAST
THINK OF IT
I HAVE NEVER SEEN LUCY BUT I KNOW MRS ROGERS AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ELIZA WAS EXACTLY LIKE HER IN FEATURES
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT BUT SQUIERS HAS REGISTERED SIXTY-SIX NON-VOTERS AND I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE PREPARED TO GIVE HALF OF THEM TO FORBES OR MEAN TO KEEP THEM ALL FOR YOURSELF IF SQUIERS HAS MADE FALSE REGISTRATIONS HE MUST STAND THE CONSEQUENCES
YOU'RE NO FRIEND OF TOM GATES
THE WOMAN WELL KNEW THAT ERASTUS COULD AFFORD TO KEEP HER IN LUXURY IF HE WOULD BUT SOME WOMEN ARE SO CONSTITUTED THAT THEY ACCEPT THEIR FATE RATHER THAN REBEL AND MARY HOPKINS LIVED THE LIFE OF A SLAVE CONTENTING HERSELF WITH PETTY SCOLDINGS AND BICKERINGS THAT DID NOTHING TO RELIEVE HER HARD LOT
THERE WERE GREAT TANKS OF LEMONADE AND TABLES COVERED WITH CANDIES AND FRUITS FOR THE CHILDREN AND MAIDS AND OTHER SERVANTS DISTRIBUTED THE THINGS AND LOOKED AFTER THE COMFORT OF THE GUESTS
BUT IT DON'T MATTER SHE DECIDED
AND HER SHREWD IRISH WIT MADE HER QUICK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY WEAKNESS SHE DISCOVERED IN THE CHARACTERS OF THE PEOPLE SHE INTERVIEWED
LOUISE KISSED THE BEAUTIFUL ELIZA AND WHISPERED
IT PLEASED ME TO HEAR MY VOICE I SEEMED TO HAVE A KEEN SENSE OF THE HUMOROUS AND IF I SAID ANYTHING AT ALL CLEVER I LAUGHED AS HEARTILY AS ANYONE
SHE WERE A PHIBBS BEFORE SHE MARRIED ERASTUS AND MY NAME IS PHIBBS WHAT DID THE LETTER FROM MRS HOPKINS SAY IT SAID SHE KNEW ELIZA TO BE A CLEVER AND WORTHY GIRL AND IF I HAD A PLACE FOR HER I COULDN'T DO BETTER THAN TAKE HER ON
I HAVE HERE THE REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SHOWING THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO FARMERS OF THE EIGHTH DISTRICT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR PRODUCE OF ALL KINDS IS ELEVEN MILLIONS FIVE-HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A MURMUR OF AMAZEMENT ROSE FROM THE AUDIENCE
THAT SPEECH DEMANDS AN EXPLANATION AND I MEAN TO HAVE IT OH YOU DO
ALREADY HE WAS REVOLVING WAYS OF CONTESTING THIS NEW ACTIVITY IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP AND DECIDED THAT HE MUST TALK WITH THE BOYS AT ONCE
IT SEEMS YOU HAVE FORGED A CHECK YES SIR I PLEAD GUILTY ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN TOLD I OUGHT NOT TO CONFESS
WHILE I WAS ARGUING WITH THE WOMAN WHO WAS A MRS HOPKINS HER HUSBAND HEARD US AND CAME OUT INTO THE KITCHEN
BUT ONE OR TWO OF HIS POEMS ARE SO AMUSING THAT THEY LINGER IN MY MEMORY ELIZA TURNED AT THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICES AND GAVE THEM A QUICK GLANCE
SHE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO FAIRVIEW AN THEY LET HER SEE TOM IN THE JAIL
DON'T YOU KNOW KEN NO SIR I HAVEN'T ASKED MYSELF BEFORE THEN I ADVISE YOU TO BE A REPUBLICAN WHY BECAUSE HOPKINS IS A DEMOCRAT AND WE MAY THEN FIGHT HIM OPENLY WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE SIR BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE OF IMPORTANCE
I GUESS YOUR HUSBAND'S GOING TO BE LATE YES
TO HIM POOR MARY WAS MERELY ONE OF HIS POSSESSIONS AND IT WOULD HAVE ASTONISHED HIM TO KNOW THAT HER SHARP TONGUE AND IRRITABLE TEMPER WERE DUE TO OVERWORK AND NEGLECT
OH ELIZA HAD A LETTER FROM MY COUSIN MRS HOPKINS WHO LIVES IN ELMWOOD IS MRS HOPKINS YOUR COUSIN ASKED KENNETH
NO SIR I'M WILLIAM BURKE YOUR MOTHER'S COUSIN
I'VE INQUIRED IN EVERY TOWN AND ALONG EVERY ROAD LEADING OUT OF THE COUNTY
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BARGAIN WITH THE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICAN SHERIFF IF THE REPUBLICANS WOULD VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE
BUT SHE IS VERY SENSITIVE--SHE INHERITED THAT FROM ME I THINK--AND TOM'S ACTION DROVE HER DISTRACTED
BUT THESE CONDITIONS WHICH I FOOLISHLY BUT HONESTLY BROUGHT ABOUT MYSELF HAVE DEFEATED ME SO FAR IN ADVANCE THAT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE TO REDEEM MYSELF
THEN HE REMEMBERED ANOTHER PLACE FURTHER ALONG THE GLEN WHICH WAS ALMOST AS PRETTY AS THIS HAD BEEN BEFORE THE DEFILING BRUSH OF THE ADVERTISER HAD RUINED IT
I DON'T LIKE THIS TRICKY POLITICS AN NEVER DID I DON'T EITHER DECLARED THE MAN
HE BELIEVED SOME OF HIS FRIENDS HAD PREPARED THIS DISPLAY TO ASSIST HIM AND TO DISCONCERT THE OPPOSITION FOR NOTHING COULD HAVE CLINCHED HIS ARGUMENTS BETTER THAN THE PRETTY YOUNG GIRLS COVERED WITH ADVERTISEMENTS OF WELL KNOWN PRODUCTS
YOU MADE A FINE SPEECH DECLARED MR WATSON GRAVELY PUFFING HIS PIPE
YOU FLATTERED THEM BOTH OUTRAGEOUSLY
THE OTHERS WERE TOO INTENT ON LEARNING THEIR FATE AND COULD NOT LEAVE THE TELEPHONE
BUT YOUNG FORBES HAD ALREADY RAISED ANOTHER ISSUE BY HIS ANTI-SIGN SPEECH AT THE SCHOOL-HOUSE AND HOPKINS INTENDED TO FORCE THAT ISSUE AND SO DEFEAT KENNETH BECAUSE OF THE RIDICULE THE LATTER'S POSITION HAD ALREADY BROUGHT UPON HIM
WE FINISHED THE LAST CANVASS YESTERDAY AND ACCORDING TO OUR FIGURES FORBES HAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN VOTES THE BEST OF US
IT IS DIVIDED INTO SMALL FARMS WHICH ARE LET OUT ON SHARES HOW MANY VOTES DO YOU CONTROL AMONG YOUR SERVANTS AND TENANTS PROCEEDED PATSY IN A BUSINESS-LIKE TONE
BUT MR HOPKINS HIS OPPONENT HAS USED THIS VERY THING TO AROUSE PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST HIM
BUT--I'M GETTING PUZZLED AND BEWILDERED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT OF COURSE NOT
WE'VE MADE A CONTRACT TO PAINT OUT EVERY SIGN IN THE DISTRICT PAINT EM OUT YES COVER THEM UP WITH NEW PAINT AND GET RID OF THEM BUT HOW ABOUT THE ADVERTISERS
COURT DON'T SET TILL NEXT WEEK THEY SAY AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE ROGERS FIVE MILES UP THE FAIRVIEW ROAD
THEN SHE ASKED
SO WE WAS ALL MIGHTY GLAD TOM HAD THAT SIXTY DOLLARS IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE SAID BETH FILLING IN ANOTHER PAUSE
YES SHE WHISPERED
THE OFFICE WAS A SMALL BRICK EDIFICE SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDINGS IN WHICH THE NOISE OF MACHINERY WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE SPEAKING COULD SCARCELY BE HEARD
AN STOP WAVIN THAT LETTER LIKE A WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER
HOW ASKED PATSY EAGERLY
COPPER CENTS NOT COMMON SENSE
THUS HE BENEFITED THE COMMUNITY GOING AND COMING WHAT
THEN WE MUST START THEM OUR WAY DECLARED HOPKINS
BUT I'M SATISFIED THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT SORT OF WORK MR MERRICK TO GET RESULTS SO AM I RETURNED UNCLE JOHN HEARTILY
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BUYING VOTES
YOU'VE GOT TWENTY MINUTES ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS
SHE JES COULDN'T DO SECH A THING NATCHERLY I KNOW SAID BETH SYMPATHETICALLY
AND SO YOU MUST SYMPATHIZE WITH MR FORBES'S CAMPAIGN IN THAT WAY YES
THEY'RE YOUNG AND RICH AND EVIDENTLY LADIES
POOR BOY HE SAID
USUALLY THE RECOVERY IS SLOW AND TEDIOUS
I'M SORRY FOR THAT MISS REPLIED THE DRUGGIST
ALSO HOPKINS PAID ME MONEY WHICH I HAD SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO REALIZE WAS NECESSARY TO ME
ALSO THEY SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS BY WATCHING ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS YOUR PREFERENCE SIR I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A REPUBLICAN WHENEVER I DABBLED IN POLITICS WHICH HASN'T BEEN OFTEN THEN I WILL BE A REPUBLICAN VERY GOOD I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT POLITICS AND HAVE NO CONVICTIONS ON THE SUBJECT
ALL YOU NEED DO IS TO TELL DAN HE MUST VOTE FOR MR FORBES AND SEE THAT HE AGREES TO DO SO WHY WAS THE POINTED QUERY
SHE SAT DOWN IN MRS SIMMONS'S KITCHEN WHERE THE GOOD WOMAN WAS IRONING AND SAID
BUT SHE WAS OUT OF HER HEAD SIR AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT
WHAT CAN WE DO GO TO WORK SAID UNCLE JOHN
THE FARMERS CAN'T EAT BEAUTY
BUT MOST MONEY IS FOOLED AWAY IN POLITICS
I AM ELIZABETH DEGRAF AND YOUR COMPANION--IS IT MR FORBES THE WOMAN ASKED
WHY I WAS SURE OF YOU MY DEARS FROM THE FIRST HE SAID
I KNOW WHAT SHE SUFFERS FOR I SUFFERED MYSELF
THE NEXT DAY BEING ELECTION DAY THE MILL WAS TO BE CLOSED AND THE MANAGER WAS VERY BUSY IN HIS OFFICE WHEN MR BURKE REQUESTED TO SEE HIM
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM SNEERED AT THE CHAMPION AND MANY REFUSED POINT-BLANK TO CONSIDER ANY PROPOSITION TO DISCARD THE ADVERTISEMENTS
THEY NEEDED MORE SCHOOL-HOUSES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH HE HOPED TO PROVIDE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE
ANYTHING ELSE SIR NO REPLIED UNCLE JOHN
RAST IS ONE OF US--HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE--AND IT'S POLICY FOR ME TO SUPPORT HIM INSTEAD OF THE ICICLE UP AT ELMHURST WHO DON'T NEED THE JOB AND DON'T CARE WHETHER HE GETS IT OR NOT IS THAT TRUE I THINK SO
FROM THE HILL COUNTRY AT THE WEST CAME SEVERAL RUSHING STREAMS WHICH TUMBLED ALONG ROCKY PATHS TO THE RIVER NINE MILES BELOW ELMHURST AND THERE ARE SCENES ALONG THESE ROUTES THAT MIGHT WELL DELIGHT THE EYE OF AN ARTIST
IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER EXPENSES WHY MAN
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN WIN YOU'VE MADE A BUNGLE OF THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN SAID SQUIERS BITTERLY
BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM VERY SICK TO ME PERHAPS SHE IS BETTER AND WILL HELP US UNTIL AFTER THE LUNCHEON IS SERVED SAID BETH
BETH WAS TRYING TO KEEP THE TEARS OUT OF HER OWN EYES FOR THE OLD MAN'S VOICE WAS EVEN MORE PATHETIC THAN HIS WORDS
IF WE'VE GOT TO BITE ANYHOW WHY NOT TAKE A HOOK THAT'S BAITED PATSY AND BETH MADE THE ROUNDS OF THE POLLING PLACES IN AN AUTOMOBILE COVERED WITH FLAGS AND BUNTING AND WHEREVER THEY APPEARED THEY WERE GREETED WITH CORDIAL CHEERS
YOU'VE BEEN LOAFING ON YOUR JOB OLD MAN AND IT WON'T DO--IT WON'T DO AT ALL
BUT I RESENTED THIS COMMAND AND RAN AWAY
SMOKED EVER SENCE I WAS A BOY YOU KNOW AN HAD TO STOP LAST WEEK BECAUSE DOC SAID IT WOULD KILL ME IF I DIDN'T REMARKED THE JAILER LEADING THE WAY
UNCLE JOHN WAITED UNTIL MR WARREN HAD LEFT HIM ALONE WITH THE NEWSPAPER MAN
AND WE WOMEN MUST STICK TOGETHER IF WE WANT TO WIN THIS ELECTION BUT I DON'T KNOW NOTHIN ABOUT IT PROTESTED MRS SIMMONS
BUT WE CAME HERE TO WORK AND WIN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT
IT'S THAT COINCIDENCE THAT MAKES ME DOUBT THE EVIDENCE OF MY OWN SENSES WHO HIRES THE SERVANTS HERE I DON'T KNOW SIR MR BURKE ABANDONED THE CONVERSATION THEN AND CONFINED HIS GAZE TO THE LANDSCAPE AS IT SHOWED THROUGH THE WINDOW
WHEN I SPEND A CENT IT COUNTS I CAN TELL YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND SOME RAST TO KEEP YOUR END UP
THIS WAS THE MOST IMPOLITE THING HE COULD HAVE DONE BUT HE VOWED THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN PACKED WITH FORBES PARTISANS AND THAT HE WAS WASTING HIS TIME IN ADDRESSING THEM
BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL--THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR
SHE RELAXED SOMEWHAT FROM THE TENSE ALERTNESS THAT WAS HABITUAL WITH HER AND LOOKED AT THE OTHER GIRL WITH A SOFTENED EXPRESSION
AT TIMES IN MY LIFE IT HAS ALMOST DRAWN ME INTO ITS DEPTHS--AND I AM NOT MAD
UNDOUBTEDLY SIR
ALSO GET UP COPY FOR SOME HAND-HILLS AND CIRCULAR LETTERS
SO PRESENTLY A WIZENED LITTLE MAN IN WORN AND THREADBARE GARMENTS HIS HAT IN HIS HAND CAME SLOWLY INTO THE GARDEN
YOU'RE THE YOUNG UN FROM ELMHURST AIN'T YE YES WELL I'D LIKE TO EARN THAT EXTRA FIVE WELL ENOUGH
THE MAN LOOKED INTENTLY INTO HER EYES IN A SHREWD YET KINDLY WAY AND SHE SEEMED AS IF FASCINATED BY HIS GAZE
BUT THE TWO PARTIES ARE THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLES THAT PROVIDE THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY FOR OUR NATION AND KEEP IT GOING PROPERLY
THE HERALD IS REALLY INDEPENDENT BUT IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS WE ADOPT THE SIDE WE CONSIDER THE MOST DESERVING OF SUPPORT YOU'RE SUPPORTING HOPKINS JUST NOW ONLY MILDLY
YOU MIGHT NOT ONLY BEAUTIFY YOUR DISTRICT BY HAVING THOSE OBJECTIONABLE SIGNS PROHIBITED BUT DO MANY OTHER THINGS TO BETTER THE CONDITION OF THE FARMERS
WE'VE COME FOR A VISIT KEN CRIED PALSY LAUGHING AT HIS EAGER DELIGHT
GET THEM STARTED A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU CAN'T HEAD THEM OFF OBSERVED THE DENTIST
YOU DON'T KNOW OLD MRS SQUIERS I KNOW THE LAW SIR AND IN ANY EVENT IT WAS A FOOLISH THING AS WELL AS CRIMINAL TO FORGE A CHECK TO GET THE MONEY THEY DEMANDED YOU ARE RIGHT SIR REPLIED TOM GATES DESPONDENTLY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THROUGH WITH THE GIRL SAID UNCLE JOHN WITH A CHUCKLE
I'VE HEARD OF YOU
BUT YOU'RE SUCH AN HONEST MAN MR HOPKINS YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY GO CROOKED MR HOPKINS FELT SHAKY AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIS TORMENTOR EARNESTLY TRYING TO DISCERN WHETHER THERE WAS ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE BENEATH THIS INNUENDO
BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN INDUCE ELIZA TO EAT CANDY THEN LET US PREPARE THE POTION IN VARIOUS WAYS
I NEEDED THESE EXTRA MEN TO HELP ME FILL A CONTRACT ON TIME AND SO EMPLOYED THEM
ARE YOU EVER AFFECTED THAT WAY ELIZA SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM PLEADINGLY AND MURMURED IN A LOW VOICE
A BRAVE MAN DOESN'T KNOW WHEN HE'S BEATEN MUCH LESS BEFOREHAND HE LOOKED AT HER FIXEDLY
I DO NOT THINK SO SAID THE LAWYER GRAVELY
THE PORTIONS OF WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTH DISTRICT WERE AS STRONGLY REPUBLICAN AND BEING MORE POPULOUS GAVE TO THE DISTRICT ITS NATURAL REPUBLICAN MAJORITY
DOUBTLESS NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD THESE TWO KINDLY MEN ACCOMPLISHED BETWEEN THEM IN THEIR QUIET SECRETIVE WAY
HE'LL WIN HANDS DOWN PATSY SHOOK HER HEAD
WHO'D A THOUGHT OF IT BUT RAST HOPKINS I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MIGHTY FUNNY ABOUT THAT DECLARED MRS HOPKINS CONTEMPTUOUSLY
HERE'S DUPREE HE SAID
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME IS TOM GATES SHE WAS THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SHOOK HER HEAD
I'M SURE SHE IS ALIVE AND THAT WE SHALL FIND HER
HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A LOT OF BOARDING-SCHOOL GIRLS WITH MORE BOLDNESS THAN MODESTY TO DICTATE THE POLICIES OF THE COMMUNITY
PUT ON SOME BLUE STOCKINGS READ THE HISTORY OF WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE CULTIVATE A LIKING FOR DEPRAVED EGGS AND THEN FACE KENNETH'S ENRAGED CONSTITUENTS I SHOULDN'T MIND DADDY IF IT WOULD HELP KENNETH ANY DECLARED PATSY STOUTLY
WILL YOU LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING OF MYSELF
HER METHOD WAS QUITE SIMPLE AND FOR THAT REASON DOUBLY EFFECTIVE
WHAT EVER INDUCED HIM TO ATTEMPT SUCH A THING HE WANTED TO DEFEAT A BAD MAN WHO NOW REPRESENTS KENNETH'S DISTRICT EXPLAINED PATSY WHOSE WISE LITTLE HEAD WAS FULL OF HER FRIEND'S DIFFICULTIES
I CAME WEST AND SECURED A POSITION TO TEACH SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTY AND FOR A TIME I WAS QUITE CONTENTED AND SUCCEEDED IN LIVING DOWN MY DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT HE'S VERY YOUNG AND HIS YOUTH IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FOLLY HE STOLE MY MONEY IT IS TRUE MR MARSHALL AND HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON I AGREE TO ALL THAT
ADDRESSIN THEM REMARKS TO ME RAST YES--TO YOU
BUT THE MAN CONTENDED THAT THE PAINT PRESERVED HIS BARN FROM THE WEATHER ON THAT SIDE
IT MUST BE SOME NEW CONCERN
SHE WORE A SIMPLE CALICO GOWN NEAT AND WELL-FITTING AND HER FACE BORE TRACES OF MUCH BEAUTY THAT TIME AND CARE HAD BEEN UNABLE WHOLLY TO EFFACE
LOUISE AND MR WATSON ARE GOING IN THE PHAETON TO VISIT SOME OF THE NEAR-BY FARMERS
ONE-FIFTH OF THAT SUM IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS AS THE INCOME TO YOU PER YEAR
BETH TOOK OCCASION TO WATCH HER MOVEMENTS SO FAR AS SHE COULD AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE GIRL WAS NOT ACTING A PART
WHY ISN'T HOPKINS A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE HE'S WHAT IS CALLED A GRAFTER
THAT ENABLED MR MERRICK TO CONCLUDE HIS ARRANGEMENTS
BUT THE PHYSICIAN CALMLY STATIONED AT THE WINDOW KNEW IT WAS NOT VERY LONG
THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MR HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
THIS WAS NOT DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE GIRL KEPT PRETTY CLOSELY TO THE LINEN ROOM AND TOM WAS CHIEFLY OCCUPIED IN THE LIBRARY
HE SHALL HAVE THE RIG AND WELCOME SO IT WAS THAT WILL ROGERS DROVE BACK TO HIS HEARTBROKEN WIFE IN A SMART TOP-BUGGY WITH TWENTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A HEART FULL OF WONDER AND THANKSGIVING
SO THEY SAT ON A BENCH UNTIL A SUMMONS CAME TO ADMIT THEM TO MR MARSHALL'S PRIVATE OFFICE
WHAT ELSE THEY'VE DONE I CAN'T TELL YET
THIS GIRL CONTINUED TOM MUSINGLY SAYS HER NAME IS ELIZA PARSONS AND SHE SAYS IT IN LUCY'S VOICE
LUCY COULDN'T ACT THAT WAY
THE GIRL MUST BE FOUND AND HER FATHER IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND HER THAN A DOZEN OTHER SEARCHERS
MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT BETH
AS LONG AS THESE SIGN-PAINTERS WERE DOING MISSIONARY WORK FOR HIS CAUSE AMONG THE FARMERS HE DECIDED TO DRIVE OVER TO FAIRVIEW AND SEE THE PARTY LEADERS IN THAT IMPORTANT TOWN
THEN CAME THE GREAT SURPRISE OF THE BOY'S LIFE WHICH CHANGED HIS CONDITION FROM ONE OF DEPENDENCY INTO AFFLUENCE
I'M SICK OF THIS INACTION AGAIN THE LAWYER LAUGHED
AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SIGN PAINTER ANSWERED THE LETTER
HOW HE HAD REDEEMED THE GLEN FROM ITS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION AND RESTORED IT TO ITS FORMER BEAUTY
BUT I WON'T BET ALL I'M WORTH IT'S ALL FOOLISHNESS DECLARED KENNETH
THE CASE IS SO INTERESTING THAT I SHOULD LIKE WITH YOUR PERMISSION TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT WHICH CAN RESULT IN NO HARM IF IT DOES NOT SUCCEED WE PUT THE MATTER ENTIRELY IN YOUR HANDS SIR SAID UNCLE JOHN
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE NOVEL IDEAS OF THE YOUNG ARTIST AS BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED TO BE AMUSED BY HEARING THE BOYISH MASTER OF ELMHURST LECTURE AT EM SO THEY FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM TO OVERFLOWING AND TO ADD TO THE DIGNITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS THE HON
BY THIS MEANS I HOPE TO INDUCE HER MENTAL FACULTIES TO RESUME THEIR NORMAL FUNCTIONS MRS ROGERS ACCEPTED THIS PROPOSAL WITH CALMNESS AND A CONFIDENCE IN THE PHYSICIAN THAT WAS ADMIRABLE
BUT MR WATSON TOOK THE PLATFORM AND SHYLY INTRODUCED THE SPEAKER OF THE EVENING
I'M TIRED OUT AND SICK OF THE WHOLE THING MYSELF THEN WHY DON'T YOU CHUCK IT SHE RETORTED SCORNFULLY AND GO TO WORK MAKIN AN HONEST LIVING OH THIS IS HONEST ENOUGH HE SAID MILDLY
I HAVE SAID THE LITTLE MAN SMILING AND THEY'VE CONVINCED ME THAT THEY MEAN BUSINESS
I'M SURE IT IS I SAW THE GIRL HE SAID
WHILE HE WAITED IN THE LIBRARY FOR MR FORBES TO RETURN FROM FAIRVIEW A MAN WAS SHOWN INTO THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN QUIETLY IN A CORNER
I FEAR ANYTHING--EVERYTHING WAILED THE POOR CREATURE THE TEARS STREAMING FROM BETWEEN HER CLOSED LIDS
WHEN PATSY ARRIVED HOME SHE CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR AND RELATED THE CONVERSATION SHE HAD OVERHEARD IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE
I'LL HAVE MARTHA SEND THE GIRL INTO THE GARDEN TO GATHER FLOWERS SHE REPLIED
BY TEN O'CLOCK THE FARM WAGONS BEGAN TO DRIVE UP LOADED WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN FOR ALL WERE INVITED EXCEPT THE GROWN MEN
I--I S'POSE YOU HAIN'T HEERD O ME BEFORE I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU MR ROGERS REPLIED THE GIRL IN HER PLEASANT VOICE
IT'S A GOOD STATE TOO SO THE THING WAS UNDERTAKEN AND BOTH THE YOUNG MAN AND THE OLD THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE CONTEST WITH ENERGY AND DETERMINATION
BETH DID NOT LIKE HERSELF VERY WELL AND WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OTHERS WOULD FAIL TO LIKE HER SO SHE DID NOT WIN FRIENDS AS EASILY AS DID LOUISE
DR HOYT WAS A HANDSOME GRAY-HAIRED MAN WITH KINDLY EYES AND A DISTINGUISHED MANNER
IT'S THE YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED ME HIS DEAR LUCY YOU--YOU'RE VERY LIKE HER STAMMERED TOM UNABLE TO TAKE HIS EYES FROM HER FACE
THEN SHE SAID CARELESSLY
MR BURKE APPEARED IN THE AFTERNOON WITH A TELEGRAM FROM DR HOYT THE SPECIALIST SAYING THAT HE WOULD BE AT ELMWOOD ON THE NOON TRAIN WEDNESDAY
WILL SHE WIN HIM OVER ASKED THE GIRL OF MR WATSON WHEN THEY WERE JOGGING ON TO THE NEXT HOMESTEAD
BUT I BELIEVE I HAVE THE MATERIAL AT HAND TO PROVE THE PERSONALITY OF THIS ELIZA PARSONS AND AFTER THAT I SHALL KNOW WHAT TO DO
I WOULDN'T MIND BEING BLIND EVEN IF LUCY HAD BEEN SPARED TO ME
IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER AND THE ELECTION WAS TO BE EARLY IN NOVEMBER
WHEN AT LAST HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS HE FOUND THE SUN SINKING IN THE WEST AND FEARED HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF INDISCRETION
I'VE GOT THREE SIGNS LET ON MY PROPERTY IN THE GLEN
BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD PRESENTLY AND SIGHED
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY WORKED SO TIRELESSLY AND EARNESTLY IT WAS NOT ALL PLAIN SAILING WITH THE GIRL CAMPAIGNERS
I WISH YOU WOULD ANSWER ME HE BEGGED
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY BIG ADVERTISER BY THAT NAME
ISN'T SHE SATISFACTORY SIR
HE SHALL NOT BOTHER YOU IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF HIM I--I'M NOT AFRAID SAID ELIZA WITH A RESUMPTION OF HER OLD MANNER AND A TOSS OF HER HEAD
I'VE GOT RESOURCES THEY DON'T SUSPECT I BELIEVE YOU RAST
AND I'LL GET THE SIXTY DOLLARS BACK THAT TOM GATES PAID HIM
MR HOPKINS HAS TAKEN A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF THIS TOWN REMARKED PATSY EXAMINING A NEW KIND OF TOOTH WASH
RAST WANTED TO GET HER IN AT ELMHURST TO WATCH WHAT FORBES WAS DOING TO DEFEAT HIM SO HE MADE ME WRITE THE LETTER
YOU SIGN-PAINTERS DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY SIGNS STARTED HE OBSERVED
I'LL GO HOME I GUESS
BUT THAT PROVES THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON
GOOD MORNING MOTHER DEAR SHE SAID A NEW SWEET TENDERNESS IN HER VOICE
BUT ON THIS ROUTE HE SAW EVEN MORE
BUT WE MAY REQUIRE THE SERVICES AND ADVICE OF AN EXPERT PHYSICIAN--A SPECIALIST IN BRAIN DISEASES DO YOU KNOW OF ONE ASKED KENNETH
KENNETH HAD OFTEN WANDERED INTO THESE OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES WHEN A HALF-FORGOTTEN NEGLECTED LAD BUT HAD NOT VISITED THEM FOR YEARS
CHAPTER IX OL WILL ROGERS BETH HAD HER FOLDING TABLE OUT IN THE ROSE GARDEN WHERE KENNETH WAS WORKING AT HIS EASEL AND WHILE THE BOY PAINTED SHE WROTE HER CAMPAIGN LETTERS AND EDITORIALS AT FIRST KEN HAD RESENTED THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS CAMPAIGN BY HIS THREE GIRL FRIENDS
SO BETH HAD A LOVELESS AND DISAPPOINTED CHILDHOOD AND ONLY AFTER UNCLE JOHN ARRIVED FROM THE FAR WEST AND TOOK HIS THREE NIECES UNDER HIS WING AS HE SAID DID HER LIFE ASSUME ANY BRIGHTNESS OR INTEREST
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT US KEN
HE DON'T LEAVE ANY STONE UNTURNED
FOR ONE THING I'D LIKE TO HIRE ELIZA PARSONS AWAY FROM YOU ELIZA PARSONS GASPED THE REPRESENTATIVE
AFTER LUNCHEON BEGAN THE SPEECH-MAKING INTERSPERSED WITH MUSIC BY THE BAND
HOW MANY HOURS SHE WANDERED WE DO NOT KNOW BUT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG BEFORE SHE LAY DOWN BY THE ROADSIDE AND FELL ASLEEP
HE WANTED THE YOUNG MAN TO ROUSE HIMSELF AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN LIFE AND IF HIS ANTAGONISM TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WOULD EFFECT THIS THE FUTILE FIGHT AGAINST THEM WAS TO BE WELCOMED
KENNETH AND HIS SUPPORTERS SAT SILENT IN THEIR PLACES THE THREE GIRLS WHO WERE NOW WELL KNOWN IN THE DISTRICT FORMING PART OF THE REPUBLICAN GROUP
OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MRS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT OH DID SHE HAVE AN ACCIDENT ASKED BETH
IN SUCH CASES A REBATE WAS ALLOWED TO THE ADVERTISER
BUT TOM WAS MISTAKEN
PATSY SLID OUT THE DOOR AND FLEW DOWN THE STAIRS AT THE IMMINENT DANGER OF BREAKING HER NECK
THERE WILL BE NO ATTEMPT MADE TO VOTE THEM I AM QUITE SURE OF IT WAS THE REPLY
SO NOW NOTHING REMAINS BUT TO FIND YOUR GIRL AND WE'LL TRY TO DO THAT I ASSURE YOU MRS ROGERS WAS CRYING SOFTLY BY THIS TIME BUT IT WAS FROM JOY AND RELIEF
FAIRVIEW'S SIX PRECINCTS GIVE US SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY-ONE MAJORITY ANNOUNCED THE BOY IN AN AWED TONE
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE GAVE HOPKINS A HARD FIGHT I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET SAID PATSY SWEETLY
IF HE SAID A WORD HE'D LOSE HIS JOB AS MANAGER
HIS SOLE INTEREST WAS IN HIS REMARKABLE CASE
I REALLY HAD LITTLE TO TELL HIM OF YOUR CONVERSATION OR MOVEMENTS YOU DID NO HARM AT ALL FOR MR FORBES WAS ELECTED REPLIED LOUISE
I SEEN EM TALKIN TOGETHER THE OTHER DAY BUT THIS ISN'T A MATTER OF FRIENDSHIP
PARSONS THE FARMER CAME OVER TO WATCH THIS NOVEL PROCEEDING HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF THREE CRISP FIVE-DOLLAR NOTES GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT MADE WITH HIM
LOOK HERE SAID THE HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVE ANGRILY WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN ELMWOOD
SHE WASN'T ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH PAINS AND FOUND IT HARD TO BEAR
BUT ELIZA PARSONS WAS STILL AT ELMHURST THE NEXT DAY CALMLY PURSUING HER DUTIES AND EVIDENTLY HAVING FORGOTTEN OR DECIDED TO IGNORE THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD SO CURIOUSLY MISTAKEN HER FOR ANOTHER
HE EVEN STOPPED A MAN WHO WAS DRIVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY TO INQUIRE ABOUT HIS HORSE WHICH HE PERCEIVED WAS VERY LAME
GO AHEAD IF IT WILL RELIEVE YOU SHE ANSWERED DEMURELY
BUT THE TIME WAS NOT OPPORTUNE SO SHE WAITED UNTIL THE FESTIVITIES WERE ENDED
THIS WAS SATURDAY AND THE ELECTION WAS TO BE ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY
TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE FOUND TWO GREAT BANNERS STRUNG ACROSS THE VILLAGE STREETS BEARING THE WORDS
HE HAD A BRIGHT FUTURE BEFORE HIM SIR AND THAT'S WHY MY CHILD WENT MAD WHEN HE RUINED HIS LIFE FOR HER SAKE WAS SHE MAD DO YOU THINK ASKED BETH SOFTLY
FROM THIS TIME ON KEN WE BECOME YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGERS
IT WAS A MODEST FRAME BUILDING STANDING WELL BACK IN A LITTLE YARD AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE AND MRS HOPKINS DID THE HOUSEWORK UNAIDED TO SAVE THE EXPENSE OF A MAID
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
WHY CANNOT YOU ANSWER IT EXCUSE ME PLEASE
IF ANYONE ANNOYS YOU COME TO ME AND I WILL PROTECT YOU THANK YOU MISS LOUISE SAID ELIZA AND THEN SHE WENT AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM IN A QUIETER AND MORE THOUGHTFUL MOOD THAN USUAL
HE WISHED TO SAVE YOU AND SO SENT ME HERE OH HE DID MR MARSHALL WAS EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
INDEED THERE WERE MORE KINDLY THOUGHTS EXPRESSED FOR THE INHABITANTS OF ELMHURST THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTY AND THE GREAT AND THE HUMBLE SEEMED MORE CLOSELY DRAWN TOGETHER
PERHAPS IN HIS HEART THE GRIZZLED OLD MAJOR WAS A BIT JEALOUS OF THE BOY
THERE WAS NOT A THOUGHT OF THE PAST NOT AN AMBITION OR DESIRE OF ANY SORT TO BOTHER ME
HE WAS MUCH INCENSED AGAINST THE GIRLS WHO WERE WORKING FOR KENNETH FORBES FOR HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PROVING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CAMPAIGN
THIS TRADING VOTES WHICH WAS OFTEN DONE WAS CONSIDERED BY THE POLITICIANS QUITE LEGITIMATE
THEN HE LOST COURAGE AND BECAME CARELESS AND RECKLESS
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR THE CARSON ADVERTISING SIGN COMPANY OF CLEVELAND OH I SEE REPLIED HOPKINS
WILL YOU CUT THAT BUD YONDER FOR MR BURKE MY DEAR THE MAID SILENTLY OBEYED AND AS THE DETECTIVE TOOK THE FLOWER FROM HER HAND HE SAID
MEANTIME UNCLE JOHN WAS HAVING A BARREL OF FUN WITH MR HOPKINS
NEITHER SQUIERS NOR HOPKINS KNEW JUST HOW THEIR SECRET HAD LEAKED OUT FOR PATSY'S PRESENCE IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE HAD NOT BEEN DISCLOSED
TO REMOVE SUCH EYESORES AS ADVERTISING SIGNS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ELMHURST IT'S A TITAN'S TASK KEN SO MUCH THE BETTER THE LAWYER GREW THOUGHTFUL
BUT IT WASN'T SO BAD MRS ROGERS
SHE GRUDGINGLY GAVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN BADE ME BEGONE CALLING ME BY SOME STRANGE NAME AND SAYING I WAS A THIEF
THEY MADE A TRIP TO EUROPE TOGETHER WHERE KENNETH STUDIED THE PICTURES OF THE OLD MASTERS AND OBTAINED INSTRUCTION FROM SOME OF THE FOREMOST LIVING ARTISTS OF THE OLD WORLD
IT WON'T BE PLAY
I COUNTED ON ELIZA PARSONS THE NEW GIRL I HIRED FOR THE LINEN ROOM AND TO DO MENDING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM
IT WON'T BE VERY EASY TO GET WORK FOR I'VE DISGRACED MYSELF IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND I CAN'T LEAVE HERE TILL SOMETHING IS KNOWN OF LUCY'S FATE
DEAR ME
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO DEAR SHE INQUIRED
HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR SHORT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES THE BOY SIPPED HIS COFFEE THOUGHTFULLY
BUT THE ADVERTISERS WILL PAINT MORE SIGNS ON ALL THE APPROACHES AND YOU WON'T HAVE GAINED MUCH I'LL DRIVE EVERY ADVERTISING SIGN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY IMPOSSIBLE
AND SUCCESS DOESN'T LIE SO MUCH IN THE CARDS AS THE WAY YOU PLAY EM
SHE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT BUT IT DID ME GOOD TO TALK WITH HER
THE DRUGGIST WAS A DEEP-DYED DEMOCRAT AND SNIFFED WHEN SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE
KENNETH PROMPTLY MAILED A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT DEMANDED AND EARLY NEXT MORNING STARTED FOR THE GLEN WITH WHAT HE CALLED HIS ELIMINATORS THESE ELIMINATORS CONSISTED OF TWO MEN WITH CANS OF TURPENTINE AND GASOLINE AND AN EQUIPMENT OF SCRUBBING BRUSHES
SHE TRIED THE APPLICATION OF A HOT-WATER BAG AND THE TOOTH ACHED HARDER
WHO EMPLOYS YOUR SERVANTS MR FORBES MARTHA MY HOUSEKEEPER USUALLY EMPLOYS THE MAIDS WILL YOU SEND FOR HER PLEASE KENNETH AT ONCE OBEYED THE REQUEST AND PRESENTLY MARTHA ENTERED THE LIBRARY
HIS FAULT HAS BEEN FORGIVEN AND HE IS NOW FREE THE WOMAN SAT SILENT FOR A TIME
BUT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WAS A BORN FIGHTER AND HIS DISCOVERY HAD ONLY DISMAYED HIM FOR A BRIEF TIME
BUT YOU WILL EAT SOME CANDY DEAR
VERY WELL MR MARSHALL SAID HE I ACCEPT YOUR TERMS THE CHECK WAS WRITTEN AND HANDED OVER AND MARSHALL TOOK THE FORGED CHECK FROM HIS SAFE AND DELIVERED IT WITH THE OTHER PAPERS IN THE CASE TO MR FORBES
THEN READ US THE LAST PAGE MY DEAR I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT SAID PATSY QUICKLY
WHAT'S THE GOOD
TOM WORKED AT THE MILL OVER T FAIRVIEW--THE BIG SAW-MILL WHERE THEY MAKE THE LUMBER AN THINGS I KNOW HE WAS THE BOOKKEEPER FER TOM HAD SCHOOLIN TOO
HAVING CONQUERED AN OLD AND TRIED REPUBLICAN WARRIOR IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN HE HAD NO FEARS IN REGARD TO THIS MERE BOY WHO COULD KNOW LITTLE OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE
YOU DON'T BELONG IN ELMWOOD NO MA'AM
I FIND THAT THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THREE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PAID THE FARMERS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE OR EXPENSE ON THEIR PART
THE THING WAS KILLING HER AND I COULDN'T BEAR IT
TO ACCUSE THEM OF BOLDNESS OR IMMODESTY IS ABSURD
DON'T WORRY IF WE'RE NOT BACK FOR LUNCHEON
SHE TOLD ME A STRANGE MAN HAD BEEN THERE FROM MR FORBES TO INQUIRE ALL ABOUT LUCY YES
YOU MADE ME YOUR SLAVE AND THREATENED ME EVERY MINUTE UNLESS I DID ALL YOUR DIRTY WORK
COME IN MR BURKE HE SAID
ON SECOND THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME WITH ME FOR YOUR TACT MAY BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE
I HOPE MY FOOLISH REPORTS TO MR HOPKINS DID NO HARM TO MR FORBES ELIZA WAS SAYING
EF YE'LL JEST RIDE UP T THE HOUSE I'LL GIV YE THE FELLER'S NAME ALL RIGHT
I--I DON'T REMEMBER SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE
WE DRESSED LIKE THE LIGHTNING CHANGE ARTIST AT THE VAUDEVILLE AND I'M SURE OUR HATS ARE NOT ON STRAIGHT THIS BIDS FAIR TO BE A STRENUOUS DAY OBSERVED THE MAJOR
I ONLY KNOW WHAT MR HOPKINS TOLD ME
IT ALL CAME ABOUT THROUGH SUCH A LITTLE THING--MERELY AN UNJUST ACCUSATION THE LITTLE THINGS ARE THE ONES THAT RUIN LIVES SHE SAID
DON'T BEAT ABOUT THE BUSH SAYS SHE
WHEN ELIZA PARSONS HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS BETH DREW A LONG BREATH AND APPROACHED TOM GATES WHO STILL STOOD BY THE WALL STARING AT THE PLACE WHERE THE GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED
WHEN THEY LEFT HER SHE PROMISED TO BE AS CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE AND TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE
INDEED THERE IS NEVER AN EXCUSE FOR CRIME
WHEN THE FARMERS PROTESTED AGAINST THIS THE ADVERTISERS GAVE THEM A FEW PENNIES AS A SOP TO QUIET THEM
I OVERHEARD SAID BETH
AUNT JANE WAS KENNETH'S AUNT MERELY IN NAME SINCE SHE HAD NEVER EVEN MARRIED THE UNCLE TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN BETROTHED AND WHO HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT BEFORE THE BOY WAS BORN
IT IS THAT WHICH BLINDED HIS CONTEMPORARIES TO HIS REAL TALENTS
HIS ENGAGEMENTS PREVENTED HIM FROM COMING ANY SOONER AND IN THE MEANTIME MR BURKE ADVISED KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH ON ELIZA PARSONS TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT RUN AWAY
FORBES SAID ERASTUS TRYING TO REGAIN HIS ACCUSTOMED EASE
OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW THE TEMPER OF YOUR PEOPLE BUT IN A COUNTRY DISTRICT SUCH AS YOURS I WOULD THINK AN ISSUE OF THAT SORT VERY HARD TO COMBAT NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE HONORABLE ERASTUS
LUCY WAS A SENSIBLE GIRL AND UNTIL THIS THING HAPPENED SHE WAS AS BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL AS THE DAY IS LONG
LOUISE AND MR WATSON AT ONCE ENTERED THE PHAETON AND DROVE AWAY THE GIRL DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF VISITING THE FARMERS WIVES AND WINNING THEM BY HER PLAUSIBLE SPEECHES
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
GIVE ME YOUR CHECK HERE--THIS MINUTE AND YOU'LL ENTER THE NAMES IN THE BOOKS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE OFFICE
EH UNCLE JOHN UNCLE JOHN TURNED AROUND AND REGARDED HIS THREE NIECES CRITICALLY
THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN A WINNING ONE USUALLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED THE ASTONISHED HOPKINS
HIS SHREWD OLD EYES SAW EVERYTHING
HOPKINS HAS CUT OUR MAJORITY DOWN TO NOTHING AND IT WILL BE A HARD STRUGGLE TO CARRY OUR TICKET THROUGH TO SUCCESS
BUT OUGHTN'T WE TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL ABOUT SPENDING KENNETH'S MONEY I'LL BE YOUR TEMPORARY BANKER SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND KEEP TRACK OF THE ACCOUNTS
AND THEN HE APPEALED TO THEM TO HELP HIM IN DRIVING ALL THE ADVERTISING SIGNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY
MR HOPKINS REINED IN AND WATCHED THEM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
OUR MAJORITY OVER HOPKINS IS TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN
TAKE ONE ROAD DEAR AND FOLLOW IT STRAIGHT ALONG AS FAR AS IT KEEPS WITHIN OUR LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT AND VISIT EVERY FARM-HOUSE ON THE WAY THE FARMERS WILL ALL BE BUSY IN THE FIELDS SAID KENNETH
THAT IS WHY I ASK IF YOUR INTEREST IN THE GIRL WARRANTS OUR GOING TO THE LIMIT TO SAVE HER KENNETH WAS THOUGHTFUL WHILE THE GIRLS LOOKED AT HIM EXPECTANTLY AND TOM GATES WITH VISIBLE ANXIETY
AND YOU MUSTN'T THINK OF HER AS DEAD MRS ROGERS SAID BETH PLEADINGLY
I HAVE HAD TO BEAR SO MUCH IN MY LIFE THAT I COULD EVEN BEAR MY CHILD'S DEATH
LOUISE AND BETH TO WHOM SHE APPEALED WERE SORRY FOR HER BUT COULD NOT RELIEVE THE PAIN
THEY PAY LIBERALLY FOR LOCATIONS PSHAW
TELEPHONE SIR SAID TOM GATES
THEM GIRLS LL NEVER BE HOUSEKEEPERS NOT FOR A MINUTE SHE AFFIRMED
I'M NOT BRAVE MY DEAR HE REPLIED MORE GENTLY THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED
BUT THE COUNTING SEEMED TO PROGRESS SLOWLY AND THE GROUP ASSEMBLED AROUND THE TELEPHONE IN KENNETH'S LIBRARY THOUGHT THE RETURNS WOULD NEVER ARRIVE
THE LAWYER LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S WHIM BUT AGREED TO HELP HIM
HAVE YOU GOT THE LIST YES
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SIR THAT I DO NOT COUNTENANCE ANY UNDERHAND DEALING THEN IT'S ALL OFF
BUT MR WATSON WILL TELL YOU THAT THE CASE IS HOPELESS AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE HOW ABOUT IT WATSON INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN TURNING TO THE LAWYER
I WANT SOMETHING TO OCCUPY MYSELF--SOMETHING REALLY DIFFICULT SO THAT I MAY TEST MY OWN POWERS BUT MY DEAR BOY
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME BETH LOOKED AT THE STRANGE GIRL WITHOUT TAKING THE HINT TO RETIRE
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT SHE RETURNED SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED
IN MY GIRLHOOD I WAS ESPECIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY SLIGHT AND THIS YOUNG MAN'S HEARTLESS ACTION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO REMAIN AT HOME AND FACE THE HUMILIATION HE HAD THRUST UPON ME
CALL JAMES AND HAVE HIM SENT HOME IN THE RIG HE'S GOING TO USE
BUT HER HEART WAS THROBBING AS MADLY AS THE TOOTH EVER DID AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO PAIN CONNECTED WITH THE THROBBING--ONLY JOY
HERE ARE THREE GIRLS WITH PLENTY OF SHREWDNESS AND ENERGY
WE'VE DONE WITH HIM MR WATSON SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR
YES MISS
YES MISS
YES MISS
THERE WAS NO MONEY IN MY POCKET AND I HAD NO JEWELS
HE BEGAN TO QUESTION ME ABOUT MYSELF AND I GAVE ANY ANSWER THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD FOR I COULD NOT TELL HIM THE TRUTH
MR MERRICK'S LIFE WAS SO SIMPLE AND UNOSTENTATIOUS THAT HIS PERSONAL EXPENSES HOWEVER ERRATIC SOME OF HIS ACTIONS COULD NOT MAKE MUCH HEADWAY AGAINST HIS INTEREST ACCOUNT AND NOTHING DELIGHTED HIM MORE THAN TO FIND A WAY TO GET EVEN WITH FATE BY RECKLESS SQUANDERING AS HE QUAINTLY EXPRESSED IT
IS THERE ANY NEWS NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE SIR UNLESS A CLEW HAS BEEN FOUND IN YOUR OWN HOUSE REPLIED THE DETECTIVE
THAT COMES FROM LIVING ON YOUR OLD FARM AT MILLVILLE SHE RETORTED
SHE IS A COLD HARD WOMAN OF THE WORLD IN SPITE OF HER TENDER YEARS
I'D LIKE TO REMAIN ELIZA PARSONS--ALWAYS
THAT'S ONE REASON ANYHOW
GO ON UNCLE JOHN SAID BETH ENCOURAGINGLY
THEY READ
INCOMPLETE RETURNS INDICATED A SLIGHT GAIN FOR HOPKINS BUT NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN VOTES ALTOGETHER
AND I THINK FORBES WOULD HAVE WON HAD NOT HOPKINS FORCED THIS UNFORTUNATE ISSUE UPON HIM
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO S'POSE IT IS SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
THE MEETING AT FAIRVIEW WAS THEREFORE THE LAST IMPORTANT RALLY OF THE CAMPAIGN
EVERY GIRL LIKES CANDY I DON'T SEEM TO CARE FOR IT SAID ELIZA CARELESSLY
CAN'T HE WIGGLE OUT ASKED UNCLE JOHN
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THE ELECTION'S OVER HAVE YOU BEEN HERE LONG HE ASKED ALTHOUGH BETH HAD TOLD HIM OF ELIZA'S COMING TO ELMHURST
IT OUGHT TO BE WORTH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS RAST SAID THE DENTIST
WELL MR ROGERS WELL THET'S HOW IT STARTED YE SEE
HER NEW SURROUNDINGS HOWEVER HAD DEVELOPED BETH'S CHARACTER WONDERFULLY AND ALTHOUGH SHE STILL HAD HER PERIODS OF SULLEN DEPRESSION SHE WAS GENERALLY AS GAY AND LOVABLE AS HER TWO COUSINS BUT IN A QUIETER AND MORE SELF-POSSESSED WAY
YOU'RE ALL VERY KIND SIR HE SAID AS YOU WERE BOUND TO BE
HOW GOES THE CAMPAIGN KEN WH--WHAT CAMPAIGN HE STAMMERED TO GAIN TIME
BREAKFAST IS READY THEN THE TWO OLD PEOPLE SAT IN SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE
THE DISTRICT WAS NATURALLY REPUBLICAN BY SIX HUNDRED MAJORITY AND HOPKINS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ELECTED BY A PLURALITY OF EIGHTY-THREE
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SHOOK HIS HEAD AT FIRST PREDICTING FAILURE
YOU SEE HE PLANS ON MY SUPPORT ANYHOW AND DON'T LIKE TO SPEND MORE THAN HE'S OBLIGED TO WHY DOES HE PLAN ON YOUR SUPPORT HE'S THE ONLY LIVE ONE IN THE GAME MR MERRICK
HE WAS PLEDGED TO AN UNPOPULAR ISSUE SO I WAS MIGHTY GLAD TO HAVE HIM RUN AGAINST ME WHAT ISSUE IS HE PLEDGED TO ASKED THE SENATOR
I REALLY CAN'T SAY MY DEAR REPLIED THE OLD LAWYER THOUGHTFULLY
A WORTHY YOUNG MAN SIR
LOUISE WAS MAKING GREAT PREPARATIONS TO ENTERTAIN THE WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE AN ORGANIZATION SHE HAD HERSELF FOUNDED THE MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE WIVES OF FARMERS IN THE DISTRICT
AT FIRST SHE RAVED AND RAMBLED INCOHERENTLY AND WILL AND I FEARED BRAIN FEVER WOULD SET IN
THE DETECTIVE GAVE LOUISE A LOOK WHICH SHE THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD
IT IS THE MOST SINGULAR CASE THAT HAS EVER COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION STATED THAT GENTLEMAN
AND SHE CHANGED HER NAME TOO AS BRASSY AS YOU PLEASE WELL I DECLARE SAID THE VISITOR
AFTER THIS THEY GAVE YOU SMALL SUMS TO PAINT THE BROAD SIDES OF YOUR BARNS YOUR BOARD FENCES AND TO PLACE SIGNS IN YOUR FIELD
IF WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT WE WON'T SHIRK IT
LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
SO HE'S OBLIGED TO SHOUT FOR HOPKINS WHETHER HE BELIEVES IN HIM OR NOT I THINK I UNDERSTAND HIM NOW SAID PATSY SMILING
KENNETH FORBES ALTHOUGH I HAVE CALLED HIM A BOY HAD ATTAINED HIS MAJORITY ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF MAY
I HOPE MY DEAR YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE LIKE YOUR MOTHER SAID MR BURKE GENTLY
IT'S A SHAME SAYS NELL ALL THET LECTION MONEY BEIN THROWN AWAY ON PAINT WHEN IT MIGHT SAVE OUR POOR CRAZY CHILD I HOPE IT AIN'T WRONG SIR
BUT HIS ENERGY WAS NOT EXHAUSTED
CHAPTER IV KENNETH TAKES A BOLD STEP THIS MAN HOPKINS GETS ON MY NERVES SAID MR WATSON A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE EVENTFUL MEETING IN THE SCHOOL-HOUSE
SHE APPEARED THE VERY DAY AFTER LUCY'S DISAPPEARANCE TO BE SURE
THAT'S JET WHAT NELL THOUGHT YE'D ASK HE SAID FINALLY AN SHE KNEW IF YE DID IT WAS ALL UP WITH OUR PLAN
WHEN HE ENDED THEY APPLAUDED HIS SPEECH MILDLY
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT I WAS WILLING TO EMPLOY YOUR SERVICES
NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT WE APPEAR JUST AS WE SHOULD BE
I'VE HAD ONE OF THE CLEVEREST DETECTIVES OF CHICAGO TRYING TO FIND HER FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS OH KENNETH EXCLAIMED BETH
I AM SURE SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE POSITIVELY
MY ORIGINAL IDEA WAS MERELY TO FIND THE MISSING GIRL IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY OF HER BLIND MOTHER SAID YOUNG FORBES
SO HE SPURRED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE WINDING WAY TO THE SPOT
ON THE SAME TICKET THAT WAS TO ELECT A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS THE CANDIDATE FOR SHERIFF OF MONROE COUNTY
THE PEOPLE HERE DON'T UNDERSTAND ME NOR I THEM
CAN YOU SUGGEST A WAY TO DO THIS LOUISE TRIED TO THINK
MEANTIME TOM GATES WAS SUNK IN THE DEEP SLEEP OF PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION AND THE DAY WORE AWAY BEFORE HE WAKENED
WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT
THEY RESOLVED TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST RETURNS WERE IN
I DON'T SAY I'LL SUCCEED BUT I PROMISE TO TRY
I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU MY LAD KENNETH FLUSHED RED
EVEN NOW I--I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MISTAKEN SHE LAUGHED MERRILY IN A SWEET MUSICAL VOICE AND THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON HER HEART AND CAST AT HIM A STARTLED LOOK THAT WAS IN SUCH SHARP CONTRAST TO HER FORMER DEMEANOR THAT HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
ONE OF THE OTHER MAIDS WILL KNOW THE GARDEN BETTER SUGGESTED THE HOUSEKEEPER
I'LL CALL IN NOW AND THEN AND SETTLE FOR THEM I REALLY THINK THIS YOUNG LADY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF HERSELF
OF COURSE SAID MR LATHAM PUZZLED TO FIND HIMSELF CHANGING FRONT SO SUDDENLY
I HEARD BUT ONCE FROM MY FATHER
I MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN
HE PROTESTED MILDLY WHEN LOUISE INVITED THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL CLUB TO MEET AT ELMHURST ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON BUT MR WATSON ASSURED HIM THAT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLAY FOR POPULARITY SO HE PROMISED TO MEET THEM
IN SOME INSTANCES HOWEVER THE MEMORY IS ABSOLUTELY RESTORED AND FROM WHAT MR BURKE HAS EXPLAINED TO ME OF LUCY ROGERS'S HISTORY THIS IS WHAT WE MAY EXPECT NOW
BUT YOUNG FORBES WAS SO THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST AND SO INDIGNANT AT THE OPPOSITION THAT HIS PLANS HAD ENCOUNTERED THAT HE FORGOT THAT IT WAS HIS FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH AND THOUGHT ONLY OF IMPRESSING HIS HEARERS WITH HIS VIEWS EXULTING IN THE FACT THAT ON THIS OCCASION THEY COULD NOT TALK BACK AS THEY USUALLY DID IN PRIVATE WHEN HE TRIED TO ARGUE WITH THEM
SO SHE GOT A JOB WORKIN FER DOC SQUIERS OVER TO ELMWOOD
YET SOME FASCINATION HELD HER TO THE SPOT
HIS GOLD WATCH-CHAIN WAS HUGE AND IMPOSING
WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON THAT ISSUE OR NOT AT ALL I'M AFRAID IT'S HOPELESS SIR MAY I COUNT ON YOUR ASSISTANCE IN EVERY WAY THANK YOU MR WARREN I'M GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY
HE DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE BUT SAT SLOWLY TWIRLING HIS HAT
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT SHE DEMANDED
CARRY THE THING A STEP FARTHER AND YOU MAY AS WELL PAINT SIGNS UPON YOUR CHILDREN'S DRESSES IN THE MANNER YOU SEE ILLUSTRATED BEFORE YOU AT THIS LOUISE MADE A SIGNAL AND THE FIFTY CHILDREN SO GROTESQUELY COVERED WITH SIGNS ROSE AND STEPPED FORWARD UPON THE STAGE
THEY ALL WORE PLAIN WHITE SLIPS UPON WHICH A VARIETY OF SIGNS HAD BEEN PAINTED IN PROMINENT LETTERS
NO LUCY IS VERY PROUD
HAVE YOU A VOTE TO SELL SHE ASKED
REALLY THE THING BEGAN TO LOOK SERIOUS
EXACTLY
SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MR HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORBES'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
BUT OUR FRIEND MADE LITTLE HEADWAY BECAUSE THE SYMPATHIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NOT WITH HIM WHY NOT SIR INQUIRED BETH WHILE KENNETH SAT INWARDLY GROANING AT THIS BARING OF HIS TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES
WHAT CAN THEY DO
FORTY SLEEP IN HAYES'S BARN AND THE OTHER TWENTY-SIX IN THE STOCK LOFT OVER THE PLANING MILL
JUST ONE PIECE TO PLEASE ME COAXED LOUISE AND SELECTED A PIECE FROM THE BOX WITH DAINTY CARE
IT ISN'T CHARITY
THE TWO GIRLS ROSE AND STOOD FACING EACH OTHER
WHEN HE MENTIONED THOMPSON SHE SAID
I'LL PAY TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS FOR THE DELIVERY TO ME OF THE FORGED CHECK AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROSECUTION AND THE COSTS I'LL PAY ALL THE COSTS BESIDES YOU'RE FOOLISH
HE'S IN THE JAIL YET WAITIN TO BE TRIED
THEN IF THEY VOTE AGAINST ME IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WORTHY OF HONEST REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I SHALL IN THE FUTURE LEAVE THEM TO THEIR OWN DEVICES THE COMMITTEE ADJOURNED A LITTLE BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK WITH RATHER GRAVE FACES AND PREPARED TO ATTEND THE DEBATE AT THE OPERA HOUSE
BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW EASILY HE HAD SUBDUED KENNETH AT THE SCHOOL-HOUSE MEETING BEFORE THE NOMINATIONS AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO REPEAT THE OPERATION
I'LL SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO WATCH THE GATES AND IF SHE GOES OUT WE'LL KNOW WHOM SHE MEETS
MAY I ASK FOR ONE FOR MY BUTTON-HOLE YES INDEED SHE REPLIED PAUSING WITH HIM JUST BESIDE ELIZA
I--I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID BETH WITH A SLIGHT GASP
JUST SIT DOWN AND KEEP ME COMPANY DEAR REPLIED LOUISE
SO HE HURRIED AWAY FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND WALKED DOWN-TOWN
THE FIGHT IS NOT AGAINST THE SIGNS THEMSELVES BUT AGAINST PUTTING THEM ON FENCES AND BARNS AND SO MAKING GREAT GLARING SPOTS IN A LANDSCAPE WHERE ALL SHOULD BE BEAUTIFUL AND HARMONIOUS
FOR WE GIRLS HAVE COME DOWN HERE TO ELECTIONEER AND FOR NO OTHER REASON ON EARTH DECLARED PATSY
MY POOR COUSIN NORA WAS SUBJECT TO A STRANGE LAPSE OF MEMORY AT TIMES HE REMARKED TO LOUISE
IN OTHER WORDS OUR COUNTRY ROADS AND COUNTRY HOMES HAVE BECOME MERE ADVERTISING MEDIUMS TO PROCLAIM THE GOODS OF MORE OR LESS UNSCRUPULOUS MANUFACTURERS AND SO ALL THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS IS DESTROYED
BUT HE TAKES YOUR ADVICE ABOUT EVERYTHING I HEAR HE DON'T TAKE IT AS OFTEN AS HE ORTER DON'T DAN INTERRUPTED MRS SIMMONS PAUSING TO FEEL WHETHER HER IRON WAS HOT
KENNETH WAS BADLY BEATEN WHEN YOU ARRIVED OF COURSE OUR GIRLS WERE VERY HAPPY AT RECEIVING THIS PRAISE BUT MORE PLEASED TO REALIZE THEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN OF SERVICE TO THEIR BOY FRIEND
SCARCELY WAS BREAKFAST FINISHED WHEN THE TWO EQUIPAGES WERE AT THE DOOR
I'M SURE OF DEFEAT IF YOU MUST KNOW HE DECLARED SCOWLING AT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS PREDICAMENT
COME MY DEAR AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY SHE LED THE GIRL WHOSE HAND WAS STILL CLASPED IN HER OWN ALONG THE PATH
THEY WERE DOING EUROPE IN COMPANY WITH A WEALTHY BACHELOR UNCLE JOHN MERRICK A GENEROUS KIND-HEARTED AND SIMPLE-MINDED OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD TAKEN THE GIRLS UNDER HIS WING AS HE EXPRESSED IT AND HAD REALLY PROVIDED FOR THEIR WORLDLY WELFARE BETTER THAN AUNT JANE HIS SISTER COULD HAVE DONE
BUT IT WAS TAKEN FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD
BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY
W
COME IN SIR SHE CALLED IN A SOFT BUT DISTINCT VOICE
TOM WAS NONPLUSSED
THE GUESTS WERE HELPED INTO THE TALL DRAG AND MERRILY THEY DROVE THE FIVE MILES TO ELMHURST NOT A WORD OF POLITICS BEING SPOKEN ON THE WAY
ON THIS SATURDAY EVENING HOWEVER THEY HAD AN EARLY SUPPER AND SHE FINISHED HER DISHES BETIMES AND SAT DOWN TO DARN STOCKINGS IN THE SITTING-ROOM
SOFTLY SHE SLID INTO THE OUTER ROOM AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
EF YE BUY UP THE SIGN PAINTERS SO'S YE CAN WASH OFF THE LETTERS LIKE ENOUGH YE'LL HEV TO PAY HIM FER TH PAINT AN PAINTIN TOO I DON'T MIND WAS THE RESPONSE
AN WHEN TOM HEERD ABOUT LUCY'S TROUBLE AN THET SHE HAD ONLY TWO DAYS LEFT BEFORE GOIN TO JAIL HE UP AN SAYS
I DON'T LIKE TO BE BEATEN SIR ONCE I'VE UNDERTAKEN TO DO A THING HE SAID
THE POTION HAD BEEN PREPARED IN SEVERAL WAYS TO TEMPT ELIZA BUT THE CANDY HAD BEEN THE EFFECTUAL BAIT
DON YOU WORRY A BIT OH TOM SAYS SHE HEV YOU GOT SIXTY DOLLARS SAVED ALREADY I'VE GOT IT LUCY SAYS HE AN I'LL GO OVER TOMORROW AN PAY DOC SQUIERS
SHE'S THE LIVING IMAGE OF MRS ROGERS THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE
A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DEFERENCE IS DUE THE YOUNG MAN BECAUSE HE INHERITED CONSIDERABLE WEALTH FROM HIS UNCLE AND AGAIN THE HISSES BEGAN AND MR HOPKINS KNEW HE MUST ABANDON PERSONAL ATTACKS OR HE WOULD HIMSELF BE DISCREDITED BEFORE HIS HEARERS
NO REPLIED ONE OF THE MEN LAUGHING
TO BEGIN WITH SAID THE GIRL COMPOSEDLY MY NAME HAPPENS TO BE ELIZA
I WANT A HUNDRED BIG SIGNS PAINTED MIGHTY QUICK SORRY SIR
THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS WERE HONEST THRIFTY SOULS AND AMONG THEM WERE MANY BOTH SHREWD AND THOUGHTFUL
I SUPPOSE CONTINUED TOM THAT I'VE THOUGHT OF LUCY SO LONG AND SO MUCH LATELY AND WORRIED SO OVER HER DISAPPEARANCE THAT I'M NOT QUITE MYSELF AND IMAGINED THIS GIRL WAS MORE LIKE HER THAN SHE REALLY IS
SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
TO KEEP WARM I BEGAN WALKING ALONG THE ROAD
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
MR WATSON AM I A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED OUTRIGHT
THE BIRDS WERE SINGING AND THE COWS MOOED IN THE MEADOW
IS THAT YOUR IDEA OF THE MAD BROKEN-HEARTED LUCY ROGERS N-NO
POLITICS IS ANOTHER NAME FOR RASCALITY PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT MA'AM
HERE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW KENNETH BELIEVED IN HIM AND WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM
SHE'S BIN GONE OVER TEN DAYS NOW AN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FER HER
THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS TEMPER AND HIS DISAPPOINTMENT QUICKLY TURNED TO RESENTMENT
WE ARE SEEN SWEET AND CLEAN FROM CORRUPTION FREE
BUT ALL THE TOWN WAS OUT TO THE GIRLS MEETIN LAST NIGHT AN I WENT ALONG TO WATCH THE FUN WHAT GIRLS MEETING THE GIRLS THET AIR WORKIN FER TO ELECT MR FORBES
ELIZA IS JUST BEYOND THAT GAP IN THE HEDGE SHE SAID AND TURNED AWAY
MY AFFLICTION RENDERS ME HELPLESS AS YOU MAY SEE WE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU MRS ROGERS SAID BETH
THIS MUCH MR FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED HE PROPOSES TO DO KENNETH THEN TOOK THE PLATFORM AND WAS WELCOMED WITH A HEARTY CHEER
SO SHE COMES HOME HEARTBROKEN AN TOLD US ABOUT IT AN WE DIDN'T HEV TH MONEY NUTHER
IT WOULD BE A SAD BEGINNING TO MY POLITICAL CAREER TO SEND THREE SUCH MEN TO PRISON
WHEN DID THOSE FORBES BANNERS GO UP ASKED MR HOPKINS IRRITABLY
PRESENTLY SHE WENT AWAY GIVING HIM AN AMUSED SMILE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM--A SMILE THAT MADE HIM FEEL THAT THIS WAS INDEED A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY
WHO ARE YOU FELLOWS SIGN PAINTERS ANSWERED THE MAN WITH AN AMUSED LOOK
ALWAYS WAS A CRANK AND AN UNSOCIABLE CUSS WHEN A BOY AND HE'S WORSE NOW HE'S GROWN UP
BUT THE INCOME ON SO LARGE A SUM WAS MORE THAN HE COULD TAKE CARE OF AND EVEN MAJOR DOYLE WHO MANAGED THESE AFFAIRS FOR HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS OFTEN PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY THAT ACCUMULATED
BRIGGS WAS A MAN WITH ONE EYE A SALLOW COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR THAT STUCK STRAIGHT UP FROM HIS HEAD
BUT LUCY HAS BEEN GONE SO LONG NOW THAT I REALIZE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO FIND HER IF INDEED THE POOR GIRL HAS NOT--IS NOT HER VOICE BROKE
SHE IS FORWARD AND SCORNFUL AND--AND PERFECTLY SELF-POSSESSED WHICH LUCY COULD NOT BE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE YOU SEEN HER CLOSELY ASKED THE DETECTIVE
TOM GATES HAS SEEN A GIRL--ONE OF YOUR MAIDS--WHO SO STRONGLY RESEMBLES LUCY ROGERS THAT HE AT FIRST BELIEVED SHE WAS THE MISSING GIRL I KNOW SAID BETH QUICKLY
HIS ENORMOUS FORTUNE WAS A CONSTANT BUGBEAR TO HIM
BUT SHE'S SO DIFFERENT SAID TOM CHOKING BACK A SOB
BUT I'M AFRAID HIS CHANCES ARE SLIM ARE THEY NOW ASKED UNCLE JOHN PRETENDING A MILD INTEREST
THE CANDIDATE FOR RE-ELECTION THEREFORE WAKENED ON ELECTION MORNING WITH THE DAMAGED OPTIC SWOLLEN SHUT AND SADLY DISCOLORED
BUT IT JES MADE HER CRY TO THINK O IT AN SO I SAYS I'LL COME AN DO THE BEST I KIN BETH WAS REALLY INTERESTED NOW
AND I'M SURE HE'LL BE TRUE AND GRATEFUL I REALLY NEED HIM BETH SAID THE BOY
THIS MAN WISHES TO GO TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND MAKE LAWS FOR YOU TO OBEY WELL WELL IT'S OUR DUTY TO WATCH HIM
BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE INSIDE DEALS YET YOU'RE RIGHT
AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST THAT IS NO EXCUSE MY DEAR DECLARED MR WATSON
KENNETH MANAGED TO BUY UP THE SPACES AND THEN HE SCRUBBED AWAY THE SIGNS
TOM'S A VERY DECENT LAD REMARKED THE JAILER ON THE WAY
WHY I THINK NOT DECLARED LOUISE
I SUPPOSE A MAN OF YOUR REFINEMENT AND GOOD TASTE HAS OFTEN THOUGHT OF THAT AND SAID THE SAME THING WHY--AHEM!--YES
IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THEY DROVE HOMEWARD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE ROYAL MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ENTERTAINED AND ADMIRATION FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAD PROVIDED THE FUN AND FEASTING
HER FEET WERE STRETCHED OUT TOWARD A SMALL FIRE THAT SMOULDERED IN AN OPEN HEARTH
ON THE SEAT BESIDE HIM WAS A YOUNG GIRL AND AS THE VEHICLES PASSED EACH OTHER BETH GAVE A START AND CLUNG TO THE BOY'S ARM
BUT I AM AS LIKELY TO DO EVIL AS GOOD AND THIS RECKLESSNESS HAS BEGUN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS TO WORRY ME
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME
IT'S ELIZA PARSONS
I'D LIKE TO GET AWAY FROM HER_--FAR AWAY FROM ANYONE WHO EVER HEARD OF THAT DREADFUL LUCY WHO FRIGHTENS ME SO
TALK TO THEM UNCLE JOHN HE BEGGED
I SHAN'T BE HAPPY UNLESS KENNETH GETS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MAJORITY WHEN THE HOPKINS PLOT WAS EXPLAINED TO MR BURKE THE DETECTIVE READILY AGREED TO GO TO FAIRVIEW AND SEE MR MARSHALL
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT SUCH A MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REPRESENT A WEALTHY AND IMPORTANT DISTRICT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT POLITICS CAN SHOW MANY A SIMILAR CASE
I MAY BE ENTIRELY WRONG FOR THE UNEXPECTED IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO LOOK FOR IN EVERY CASE OF MYSTERY THAT HAS COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION
THE EVENINGS WERE GETTING COOL NOW AND A GRATE FIRE WAS BURNING
WE WILL CHANGE ALL THAT SHE SAID
FOR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EIGHTH DISTRICT HE'S FLYING HIGH FOR A FLEDGLING OBSERVED THE MAJOR
THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP AN AIR AND THE LITTLE GIRLS SANG THE FOLLOWING DITTY
SO SHE DRESSED HERSELF AND WALKED THE FLOOR WITH THE PERSISTENT ACHE AS AN INTIMATE COMPANION
YOU HAD TO HAVE A NAME SO YOU TOOK THAT ONE YES
COULDN'T WE GET HIM TO WITHDRAW HE MIGHT BE SUDDENLY CALLED TO EUROPE SUGGESTED LOUISE
ALL I NEED IS THE BLUE STOCKINGS LAUGHED PATSY
NO--NO
THE WALL AND PERMITTED HER TO SWEEP BY HIM WHICH SHE DID WITH A GESTURE OF DISDAIN
SOME OF THESE COUNTRY YOKELS MUST REPRESENT US HE OBSERVED
FARMERS AROUND HERE ARE THRIFTY PEOPLE AND THEY FEAR TO LOSE THE TRIFLING SUMS PAID THEM FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF PAINTING SIGNS ON THEIR PREMISES PATSY NODDED GRAVELY
I SUPPOSE CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER KEN SAID LOUISE
HOW'N THE WURLD SHE EVER GOT AWAY WE CAN'T MAKE OUT NOHOW DID SHE GET AWAY ASKED THE GIRL NOTING THAT THE OLD MAN'S EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS AND HIS LIPS TREMBLING
MY MOTHER HAD PASSED ON LONG BEFORE AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO KEEP ME AT HOME
AND NONE OF THEM DISPLAYED THE LEAST ANNOYANCE AT THE VITUPERATION MR HOPKINS HAD EMPLOYED
GLAD YOU'RE HERE CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE AIRILY AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD THAT BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE
I SUSPECTED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT HER THE MORNING SHE CAME TO THE HOUSE HERE
THERE WERE THREE OF THESE HUGE SIGNS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GLEN AND THEY RUINED ITS NATURAL BEAUTY
I'D RUTHER MY VOTE WAS CAUGHT BY A CUP OF HOT COFFEE ON A COLD DAY THAN BY NOTHIN AT ALL
AND IT WAS FITTED WITH MODERN CONVENIENCES FOR MR WARREN HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND PROSPEROUS
THIS IS A PECULIAR JOB FOR OUR FIRM TO TACKLE
PERHAPS I'M INVITING TROUBLE HE MURMURED
I WISH YOU KNEW THEM BETTER SO DO I MR WATSON
THE PARTY FROM ELMHURST LUNCHED AT THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL AND THEN THE GIRLS HURRIED TO THE OPERA HOUSE WHILE KENNETH REMAINED TO ATTEND A CONFERENCE OF THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE
AND KENNETH ESPECIALLY WHO HAS SUCH LARGE LANDED INTERESTS OUGHT TO DIRECT THE POLITICAL AFFAIRS OF HIS DISTRICT I'M MUCH INTERESTED IN POLITICS TOO UNCLE DECLARED THE GIRL
ELIZA CAME WILLINGLY
PATSY WAS DELIGHTED FOR SHE HAD WORKED HARD IN ELMWOOD AND THIS PROVED THAT HER EFFORTS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
THE BOY HAD COME TO LIVE AT ELMHURST WHEN HE WAS A MERE CHILD BUT ONLY AS A DEPENDENT UPON THE CHARITIES OF AUNT JANE WHO HAD ACCEPTED THE CHARGE OF THE ORPHAN BECAUSE HE WAS A NEPHEW OF HER DEAD LOVER WHO HAD BEQUEATHED HER HIS ESTATE OF ELMHURST
HE HAD LOST HIS SPIRIT AND ENTHUSIASM SINCE THE MEETING AND WAS FAST RELAPSING INTO HIS OLD STATE OF APATHY AND BOREDOM
AND LIFE ISN'T WORTH LIVING WHEN DESPAIR AND DISAPPOINTMENT FILLS IT I CANNOT SEE WHY LUCY SHOULDN'T YET BE HAPPY PROTESTED BETH
OTHERWISE HE COULDN'T HAVE SECURED THE NOMINATION WHEN HE PRETENDED TO RUN AGAINST HOPKINS--FOR IT WAS ONLY A PRETENSE
OR AT LEAST SHE BECAME INSANE REPROACHING HERSELF FOR HAVING DRIVEN THE BOY TO THIS DREADFUL DEED
SHE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY AVERSE TO HAVING HIM SIT THERE
SHE WAS LAUGHING GAILY AND TALKING WITH THE HONORABLE ERASTUS
AND NOW SAID UNCLE JOHN GET BUSY AND HUSTLE FOR KENNETH FORBES I WILL SIR SAID BRIGGS WITH UNEXPECTED ENERGY
AND FIFTY--WHY FIFTY WILL SCARCELY GO AROUND
IF I WAS LIKE THEM GIRLS UP AT ELMHURST FUSSIN ROUND OVER POLITICS ALL THE TIME THIS HOUSE WOULD GO TO RACK AN RUIN OH THEM HE SAID WITH MILD SCORN
HE'S IN THE LIVERY OFFICE THEN THE MAN CLIMBED INTO HIS WAGON AND DROVE AWAY AND HOPKINS TURNED INTO THE LIVERY OFFICE
I TELL YOU SENATOR HE'S THE WORST LICKED CANDIDATE THAT EVER RAN FOR OFFICE NEVERTHELESS THE SUGGESTION THAT THE ANTI-SIGN ISSUE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER LOCALITIES MADE MR HOPKINS A TRIFLE UNEASY AND HE DECIDED TO RETURN HOME AND KEEP THE FIGHT GOING UNTIL AFTER ELECTION WHETHER YOUNG FORBES CAME OUT OF HIS SHELL OR NOT
MY DARLING WAS FRANTIC WITH GRIEF AND SHE COULDN'T BEAR THE HUMILIATION AND DISGRACE OF HER POSITION
BECAUSE WHILE MR FORBES'S ERRATIC VIEWS AND ACTIONS HAVE DONE LITTLE REAL HARM WE HAVE BEEN EDUCATED TO AN APPRECIATION OF CERTAIN BENEFITS WE ENJOY WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED OUR ATTENTION
THE DEBATE WITH HOPKINS WAS THE THING THAT OCCUPIED THEM JUST NOW AND WHEN PATSY JOINED THE GROUP OF WORKERS THEY BEGAN TO DISCUSS SOME MEANS OF SCORING A DECISIVE VICTORY AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE
I HAD NO IDEA HOPKINS AND SQUIERS WOULD TRY TO VOTE THEM TOMORROW THIS WAS A PALPABLE FALSEHOOD BUT MR BURKE ACCEPTED THE LAME EXCUSE WITHOUT QUESTION
IF LUCY IS FOUND DO YOU WANT HER TO SEE YOU IN THIS CONDITION CAN SHE BE FOUND SIR DO YOU THINK WE ARE TRYING TO FIND HER REPLIED KENNETH
IF HE STOPPED THE ADVERTISING SIGNS I WOULDN'T SELL HALF AS MANY PAIN-KILLERS AND LIVER-PILLS HE'S MY COUSIN SAID PATSY MENDACIOUSLY
PLEASE LET ME GO IN A MOMENT ELIZA HER HANDS WERE CLASPED TOGETHER NERVOUSLY AND SHE HAD DROPPED HER BASKET AND SCISSORS ON THE PATH BEFORE HER
MR FORBES OF ELMHURST HE ASKED GLANCING AT THE CARD KENNETH HAD SENT IN
THE ENCROACHMENTS OF ADVERTISERS ON PERSONAL PROPERTY MAY LEAD TO A REVOLT IN THE FUTURE BUT IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO DIRECT POPULAR OPINION AGAINST THEM ISN'T FORBES A BETTER MAN FOR THE PLACE THAN HOPKINS ASKED UNCLE JOHN
WHO ARE YOU SIR HE ASKED
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT LUCY
HE WAS A DISAPPOINTED MAN AND WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE
IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CROWD A FAINT HISSING BEGAN TO BE HEARD
HIS ATTEMPT TO WAKE UP KENNETH HAD RESULTED IN FAILURE MAINLY BECAUSE THE BOY HAD BECOME DISCOURAGED SO EARLY IN THE GAME
SIT DOWN PLEASE SHE SAID SLOWLY
AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING WHAT KEN ANY COMPANION OF MR HOPKINS CAN BE EASILY TRACED THAT'S TRUE ANSWERED THE GIRL THOUGHTFULLY
YET THE EYES HE TURNED UPON BETH AS SHE FACED HIM HAD A WISTFUL AND PLEADING LOOK THAT AFFECTED HER STRANGELY
OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED TROUBLE HAD THESE MEN VOTED OF COURSE MR BURKE
CAN'T YOU SEND FOR MORE MEN WE'VE GOT THIRTY-EIGHT ON THIS JOB AND CAN'T GET ANY MORE FOR LOVE OR MONEY
YOU SEE SHE ISN'T ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO COME MUCH IN CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY
HE WAS A ROUND-FACED RESPECTABLE APPEARING FELLOW BUT HIS MOOD WAS DISTINCTLY UNSOCIABLE
THEN I MADE A DISCOVERY
I SEE NO WAY TO STOP THEM NOR I AT PRESENT
OUR WORK IS DONE NOW ISN'T IT WELL I'M GOING TO THE POLLS AND WORK FOR EVERY VOTE DECLARED PATSY
SOME DRUGGISTS HAVE SO LITTLE TASTE IN SELECTING SUCH THINGS YES MISS I DO RATHER PRIDE MYSELF ON MY PERFUMES REPLIED LATHAM GRACIOUSLY
I HAVEN'T SLEPT A WINK SINCE I HEARD THE AWFUL NEWS OF HER SICKNESS AND ESCAPE
NOW THEN HOW MUCH LAND DO YOU OWN AT ELMHURST KENNETH LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT THE LAWYER
EVIDENTLY SHE HAD CAUGHT COLD AND THE WICKED MOLAR WAS SIGNALING THE FACT
HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS RENOMINATION BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT REPRESENTED HIS DISTRICT VERY SATISFACTORILY
IT'S--IT'S EASIER THAN WE EXPECTED
THEY WELCOMED THE YOUNG MAN BUT ADROITLY TURNED THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND AGAIN THE SUBJECT OF WAS REJOINED
FOR A DAY OR SO THE SUBJECT WAS NOT RESUMED AND THEN MR WATSON CASUALLY INTRODUCED IT
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN TWENTY VEHICLES ALTOGETHER AND SOME OF THE RIGS WERE ALREADY STARTING OUT AND DRIVING BRISKLY AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
BUT YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT WHAT ANY MAN CAN DO BURKE WILL DO I'M SO GRATEFUL SIR SAID TOM
BUT THE THICK SPLASHES OF PAINT CLUNG DESPERATELY TO THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK AND THE TASK WAS A HARD ONE
BETH DEGRAF WAS THE BEAUTY OF THE GROUP OF THREE AND SHE ALSO POSSESSED GREAT DEPTH OF CHARACTER
IN THE MAIN I'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY AND CONTENT LATELY
IT IS ONLY BY UNDERSTANDING FULLY BOTH SIDES OF AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU CAN HOPE TO ARRIVE AT A JUST AND IMPARTIAL DECISION
YOU WOULDN'T TRY FOR INSTANCE TO ENCOURAGE FALSE REGISTRATION SIR ANYTHING WRONG MR HOPKINS ASKED UNCLE JOHN INNOCENTLY
STATE THE FIGURE
WHAT BROUGHT THE LEGISLATOR TO THE MEETING WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS COMING FORWARD FOR RE-ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND BELIEVED THAT THIS AFFORDED A GOOD CHANCE TO MEET SOME OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AND MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION
LOUISE MERRICK BETH DEGRAF AND PATSY DOYLE THE THREE NIECES WERE REALLY GLAD THAT THE BOY INHERITED ELMHURST AND RETURNED TO THEIR EASTERN HOMES WITH THE MOST CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THEM ALL
WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL EVER CARE TO ALLOW ADVERTISING SIGNS ON YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN AND THAT THE QUIET REFINEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL INDUCE MANY OTHER PLACES TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS
ARE YOU SURE HE ASKED
HE CAN'T SLEEP OR REST TILL HE FINDS HER FOR MY HUSBAND LOVES HER AS WELL AS I DO
IT'S--IT'S AWFUL IT IS
THIS WAS NOT THE OWNER'S FAULT AND KENNETH HAD BROODED UPON THE MATTER UNTIL HE HAD COME TO REGARD IT AS A DISTINCT MISFORTUNE
OUR MAJORITY IS TOO GREAT TO OVERCOME WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MAJORITY WILL BE
IF WE LOOK GOOD THEN ALL MEN SHOULD VOTE FOR KENNETH FORBES THE CHEERING WAS RENEWED AT THIS AND MR HOPKINS BECAME ANGRY
AND THIS VISITOR WOULD NOT TRY TO SHUT HER UP THE WAY ERASTUS DID
ONCE IN HER ROOM WITH THE STRANGE MAID LOUISE LOCKED THE DOOR QUIETLY AND SAID TO HER COMPANION WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE
I HEARD YOU GAVE THE GIRL A LETTER TO YOUR COUSIN MARTHA WELL I DID
KENNETH SCRUTINIZED HIM CLOSELY
SUPPOSE EVERY FARMER IN THIS DISTRICT REFUSED TO PERMIT SIGNS UPON HIS PROPERTY
IT MEANS YOUR WHOLE FUTURE
SAY TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED DOC RIGHT ON THE NAIL
WHEN SHE AWAKENED HER MIND WAS A BLANK AS REGARDS HER IDENTITY AND FORMER HISTORY
HE GREW UP IN A SECLUDED CORNER OF THE GREAT HOUSE TENDED MERELY BY SERVANTS AND SUFFERED TO PLAY IN THOSE QUARTERS OF THE AMPLE GROUNDS WHICH AUNT JANE DID NOT HERSELF VISIT
I RESENTED THE THOUGHT THAT I MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN A THIEF ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T MIND STEALING EVEN NOW IF I WANTED ANYTHING AND COULD TAKE IT OH ELIZA GASPED LOUISE
BUT LOUISE LAUGHED HER SOFT MUSICAL LAUGH AND REMARKED
DIDN'T YOU KNOW
OF COURSE I'M PAYING FOR ALL THIS EXPENSE ACKNOWLEDGED MR HOPKINS SOMEWHAT REGRETFULLY
SHE'S A PRETTY GIRL IS LUCY
THE BOY LOOKED AT HIM
THE PRIMARIES FOR THE NOMINATION ARE NOT TO BE HELD FOR TWO WEEKS AND THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SEEM SHY ABOUT COMING FORWARD DIDN'T YOU SAY THE DISTRICT WAS REPUBLICAN YES
TO HIMSELF HE ADMITTED THEIR SHREWDNESS AND ACTIVITY AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AN EXPERIENCED HEAD WAS MANAGING THEIR AFFAIRS
BUT WHERE DID YOU LIVE BEFORE YOU CAME HERE SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
FORBES IS A COMING MAN AND HE'LL DO MORE FOR US ALL THAN HOPKINS COULD
BETH COULD SCARCELY RECOGNIZE IN HIM THE CALM AND CHEERFUL TOM GATES THEY HAD VISITED IN THE COUNTY JAIL
I'VE COME TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT YOUNG GATES OH
HE ONLY DISCHARGED THE MAN WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRE HOW LONG AGO WERE YOU ARRESTED ASKED BETH
A MILE FARTHER ON HE CAME UPON A GANG OF THE SIGN PAINTERS WHO WITH THEIR HUGE BRUSHES WERE RAPIDLY PAINTING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF A WEATHER-WORN FENCE WITH WHITE PAINT
I HAVEN'T HEARD OF EM WHY THEY'RE COUSINS O KENNETH FORBES IT SEEMS AN COME FROM NEW YORK TO GIT HIM ELECTED WHAT ARE THEY LIKE THEY'RE SWELL DRESSERS RAST AN NICE APPEARIN GIRLS AND MIGHTY SHARP WITH THEIR TONGUES
BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO MARRY AN SHE WANTED TO BE EARNIN MONEY
THEN SHE PICKED UP THE BOX OF BON-BONS THAT WAS BESIDE HER
WHERE ARE THESE MEN INQUIRED DR SQUIERS THOUGHTFULLY
IT HAD REMAINED FOR MR HOPKINS TO ACCUSE THEM AND HIS CIRCULAR HAD A WIDE INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE ISSUE OF THE CAMPAIGN
WHEN MR FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM
TELL ME TOM IS SHE REALLY LIKE LUCY HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A DAZED EXPRESSION AS IF HE SCARCELY COMPREHENDED HER WORDS
I EXAMINED MYSELF WITH WONDER FOR I HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS OR HOW I CAME THERE
HIS SENSITIVE FACE HAD NOT BEAMED WITH SO MUCH ANIMATION FOR MONTHS
TO BEGIN WITH KENNETH VISITED THE GLEN ONE DAY TO MAKE A SKETCH AND FOUND HIS OLD TABLE-ROCK COVERED WITH AN ADVERTISING SIGN HOW PREPOSTEROUS EXCLAIMED LOUISE
I TOLD HER I KNEW HER RECORD AN TO GET OUT AND WHILE WE WAS ARGUIN RAST COME OUT AND TOOK A HAND IN THE TALK
AN WHEN SHE GREW UP SHE HAD MORE BOYS COMIN TO SEE HER THAN ANY GAL THIS SIDE O FAIRVIEW AN ONE O EM CAUGHT LUCY'S FANCY
WHEN HE HUNG UP THE RECEIVER UNCLE JOHN WAS SMILING
SOMEHOW I HAVE AN IDEA THIS TROUBLE WILL ALL TURN OUT WELL IN THE END HAVE YOU ASKED THE WOMAN EARNESTLY
HE'S THE DENTIST THERE AN LUCY HELPED WITH THE HOUSEWORK AN KEPT THE OFFICE SLICKED UP AN EARNED EV'RY PENNY SHE GOT HE STOPPED HERE AND LOOKED VACANTLY AROUND
BY THIS TIME THE CAMPAIGN OF THE YOUTHFUL PROPRIETOR OF ELMHURST AGAINST ADVERTISING SIGNS BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND WAS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH MERRIMENT AMONG THE FARMERS
IT'S HARD SIR--I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE NELL CRY
THIS GIRL'S EYES LAUGHED WHILE LUCY'S WERE GRAVE AND SERIOUS
THEN MAKE OUT YOUR CHECK AND I'LL GET THE BOOKS THERE WAS A STIR BEHIND THE PARTITION AND A SOUND OF CHAIRS SCRAPING THE FLOOR
HE CONVEYED NEVERTHELESS THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS MORE PROSPEROUS THAN REFINED AND THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN WERE AS QUICK TO RECOGNIZE THIS AS WAS MR WATSON HIMSELF
SHE DID NOT PARTICIPATE LARGELY IN THE PROSPERITY OF HER HUSBAND AND OFTEN DECLARED SHE WAS WORKED TO DEATH ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO CHILDREN TO CARE FOR
BUT I'M THROUGH WITH YOU NOW--FOR GOOD AND ALL HOPKINS TURNED AND WALKED OUT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
FOR ALTHOUGH THEY CALLED THEMSELVES COUSINS THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP EVEN OF MARRIAGE AS PATSY'S AUNT JANE HAD MERELY BEEN BETROTHED TO KENNETH'S UNCLE WHEN HE DIED
SO HE WAS BOTH GRUFF AND DISAGREEABLE WHEN PATSY AFTER BUYING A LOT OF RIBBONS OF HIM BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF POLITICS
PATSY AND BETH SUPPORTED THEIR COUSIN LOYALLY AND ASSISTED IN THE PREPARATIONS
AUNT JANE DIED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO TRANSFER THE ESTATE TO ONE OF HER NIECES BECAUSE BY THE TERMS OF HIS UNCLE'S DEED TO HER THE PROPERTY REVERTED ON HER DEATH TO KENNETH HIMSELF
ALSO I BELIEVE ELMHURST TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ESTATE IN THE DISTRICT AND YOU TO BE THE LARGEST TAXPAYER
I PREFER TO ADMINISTER A POWERFUL SLEEPING POTION
WHY DO YOU ANNOY ME IN THIS MANNER
NOT THAT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS CARED A FIG ABOUT THIS FOOLISH TALK OF EXTERMINATING ADVERTISING SIGNS
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
TEAS AND SOAPS PILLS AND DOPES WE ALL MUST ADVERTISE
BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY AND I'VE A GOOD MANY DETAILS YET TO ARRANGE NO CHANCE OF YOU'RE GETTING IN JAIL IS THERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I ONLY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU'D DONE ANYTHING LIABLE TO MAKE TROUBLE YOU'D HAVE TO ARRANGE YOUR AFFAIRS FOR A LONG SPELL IN JAIL
KENNETH SURPRISED HIMSELF THIS MORNING BY GREETING SEVERAL OF HIS NEIGHBORS WITH UNUSUAL CORDIALITY
YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN EXAMPLE OF CLEAN BARNS AND FENCES AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW PROUD I AM OF THIS DISTRICT WHEN I RIDE THROUGH IT AND SEE NEATLY PAINTED BARNS AND FENCES REPLACING THE FLARING AND OBTRUSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS THAT FORMERLY DISFIGURED THE HIGHWAYS
WHEN OUR CHILD CAME--OUR LUCY--WILL WAS DEVOTED TO HER AND THE BABY WAKENED IN ME ALL THE OLD PASSIONATE CAPACITY TO LOVE
HE WON'T RUN AWAY
PAINTED BROADLY UPON THE FACE OF THE ROCK IN GREAT WHITE LETTERS WAS THE ADVERTISEMENT OF A PATENT MEDICINE
POOR GIRL
SATURDAY FORENOON THE THREE GIRLS WITH KENNETH MR WATSON AND UNCLE JOHN RODE OVER TO FAIRVIEW TO PREPARE FOR THE DEBATE THAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN THE AFTERNOON LEAVING ONLY TOM GATES AT HOME
LOUISE GLANCED AT THE DOOR THAT COMMUNICATED WITH BETH'S ROOM
HE WAS BY NATURE SHY AND RETIRING TO A DEGREE
AND I'M AFRAID TO FIND OUT
SO HE CAME EARLY AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EVERYONE THAT ARRIVED AND AFTERWARD TOOK AS PROMINENT A SEAT AS POSSIBLE
I AGREED TO THIS READILY PROMPTED BY A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF FOR I CARED NOTHING FOR HOPKINS AND HAD NOTHING AGAINST MR FORBES
WHO WAS SHE DO YOU SUPPOSE SHALL I TELL YOU ASKED LOUISE
THE GIRL WONDERED HOW SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO KNOW HER VISITORS SEX SO ACCURATELY
BUT CAN THE PLOT BE FOILED AT THIS LATE DATE INQUIRED LOUISE ANXIOUSLY
PERHAPS THAT RASCALLY HOPKINS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE ADVISED YOU TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I CAN'T DO BETTER THAN TO MAKE IT CLEAN--TO DO AWAY WITH THESE DISREPUTABLE SIGNS SAID THE BOY STUBBORNLY
ERASTUS HOPKINS WELL KNEW THIS FEELING AND SMILED IN HIS POMPOUS AND MOST SARDONIC MANNER WHEN HE LEARNED WHO WAS HIS OPPONENT
SHE WAS SOMEWHAT FRIVOLOUS AND DESIGNING IN CHARACTER BUT WARM-HEARTED AND STAUNCH IN HER FRIENDSHIPS
WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING
BUT SHE REFUSED WAS THERE A SCAR ON LUCY ROGERS'S LEFT ARM YES SIR
HE WAS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE OPPOSITE KENNETH AND HELD UP A BIG GLARING POST-CARD WHICH WAS IN HIS MAIL
WE WILL NOW PLACE HER IN HER OWN ROOM UPON HER BED WHILE MR BURKE AND I DRIVE OVER TO HER FORMER HOME TO COMPLETE OUR ARRANGEMENTS WON'T SHE WAKEN ASKED LOUISE
ALL YOU NEED DO IS TO ADD THESE SIXTY-SIX NAMES TO THE REGISTRATION LIST AND THEN WE'LL VOTE EM WITHOUT OPPOSITION AND WIN OUT PATSY GAVE A GASP WHICH SHE TRIED TO STIFLE
BUT ONE THING'S CERTAIN DOC
IT WAS THIS SAVING CLAUSE IN THE CONTRACTS OF WHICH UNCLE JOHN HAD DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
JUST SEE HOW STORIES GET TWISTED
THE AUTOMOBILES UNCLE JOHN HAD ORDERED SENT DOWN WERE A GREAT ASSISTANCE TO THE GIRLS AND ENABLED THEM TO COVER TWICE AS MUCH TERRITORY IN A DAY AS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE WITH HORSES
THIS FOOLISH PROPOSITION ISN'T WORTHY YOUR EFFORT
SOME CALLED HIM A PRIG AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS STUCK UP AND CONCEITED
WHAT AM I TO YOU
BUT ELIZA SAID SHE HAD A HEADACHE THIS MORNING AND COULDN'T STAND THE SUN SO I LET HER OFF
HE HAD BEEN AN UNSOCIABLE LAD AND SINCE HE HAD BECOME MASTER OF ELMHURST HAD DONE LITTLE TO CULTIVATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED AROUND HIM
BY COMPROMISING WITH ME YOU CAN RECOVER YOUR LOSS AND ARE PAID FOR YOUR ANNOYANCE YOU'RE RIGHT
NOW HERE'S A SACHET POWDER THAT GIVES FINE SATISFACTION I'LL TAKE A COUPLE OF PACKETS OF THAT TOO SINCE YOU RECOMMEND IT LATHAM BEGAN DOING UP THE PURCHASES
JEFFERSON COUNTY RETURNS BEGAN TO COME IN RAPIDLY AND WERE RECEIVED IN DISMAL SILENCE
IT SOUNDS WICKED DOESN'T IT
IF YOU'RE DEFEATED NOW YOU'RE A BACK NUMBER IN THIS DISTRICT AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S TOO MUCH DOC
WHERE'D YOU RAISE THE MONEY THOMPSON NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE FACT WITHOUT BEING TOLD OH I KNOW RAST HOPKINS AN SO DOES DAN THEN I CAN DEPEND ON YOU TO HELP US ASKED THE GIRL PATTING THE TOUSLED HEAD OF A LITTLE GIRL WHO STOOD BY STARING AT THE PRETTY LADY I'LL TALK TO HIM BUT I DUNNO WHAT GOOD IT'LL DO SAID MRS SIMMONS THOUGHTFULLY
IT WAS A LIGHT GREY IN COLOR AND PLAINLY MADE
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED FOR REPRESENTATIVE HE MANAGED TO DICTATE BY SHREWD METHODS THE NOMINATION OF THOMPSON THE STORE-KEEPER ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET
I WAS MERELY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HER TO A HIGHER SPIRITUAL LIFE
I RAN FOR CORONER AN GOT TWO WHOLE VOTES--ME OWN AN THE UNDERTAKER'S
THIS CANVASS WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY FOR FINAL REPORT SHOWED ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED MAJORITY FOR FORBES
IT IS BECAUSE MR FORBES BELIEVES IN NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING AND WANTS TO PROTECT IT THAT HE'S AGAINST THESE SIGNS
BUT I'LL HAVE A TRIAL IN A FEW DAYS THEY SAY
AND--AND--ALONG THE RIVER THEY SAY NO GIRL ANSWERING HER DESCRIPTION HAS BEEN SEEN IT'S STRANGE REMARKED KENNETH THOUGHTFULLY WHILE THE GIRLS REGARDED THE YOUTH WITH SILENT SYMPATHY
TO THE ENCROACHING ADVERTISER THESE SIGNS OF THE TIMES ARE CONSIDERED LEGITIMATE
THEN HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD WITH A PUZZLED AIR AND WENT HOME
THIS IS ONLY OUR SECOND DAY AND WE'RE PRETTY BUSY WAIT A MINUTE CALLED THE BEWILDERED HOPKINS FOLLOWING SMITH TO HIS BUGGY
WILL YOU FINISH CUTTING THESE ROSES MR BURKE SHE ASKED WITH A SMILE
OUR GIRL--OUR POOR LUCY
FOR ELIZA IS NOT DEMENTED
BESIDES NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE TASK OF EXTERMINATING THEM TRUE ENOUGH
OTHERS SAID HE WAS A NAMBY-PAMBY WITHOUT BRAINS OR WIT
THE SCENERY WAS ALL NEW TO ME
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND UNCLE JOHN ABOUT SHE REPLIED HER HAPPY FACE GROWING AS SERIOUS AS IT COULD EVER BECOME
WHILE BETH AND KENNETH WERE IN THE GARDEN THIS SUNNY AFTERNOON JAMES CAME TO SAY THAT A MAN WANTED TO SEE ONE OF THE POLITICS YOUNG LADIES SHALL WE SEND HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BETH ASKED THE BOY
BUT I WISH ELIZA TO GO VERY WELL MISS LOUISE FROM AN UPPER WINDOW THE GIRL WATCHED UNTIL SHE SAW ELIZA PARSONS LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH A BASKET AND GO INTO THE RETIRED GARDEN SHE HAD CHOSEN
THERE MUST BE SOME REFINEMENT AMONG THEM BUT THE LAWYER WAS NOT CONVINCED
HE WAS NOT AN ESPECIALLY POPULAR MAN IN HIS DISTRICT AND HE KNEW IT
HE WAS A MAN AN IT WOULDN'T HURT FER HIM TO GO TO JAIL SO MUCH AS IT WOULD A GIRL
I BELIEVE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE VENTURED
SUDDENLY SHE PAUSED IN HER WORK HER HEAD TURNED SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE TO LISTEN
THE MID-DAY DINNER WAS NOT VERY INVITING BUT PATSY PRAISED THE COOKING TO THE LANDLORD'S WIFE WHO WAITED UPON THE TABLE AND UNCLE JOHN BOUGHT ONE OF THE LANDLORD'S CIGARS AFTER THE MEAL AND TALKED POLITICS WITH HIM WHILE HE SMOKED IT
ELIZA LAUGHS AT ME AND QUIZZES ME
I'VE BEEN LOOKING UP HOPKINS'S RECORD
HE'S RUNNING FOR A POLITICAL OFFICE SO AS TO DO SOME GOOD FOR HIS COUNTY AND DISTRICT AND I'VE COME TO SEE IF YOU'LL HELP ME GET VOTES FOR HIM LAW SAKES CHILD EXCLAIMED MRS SIMMONS I AIN'T GOT NUTHIN TO DO WITH POLITICS NO
IF YOU'RE MY OWN TOM YOU'LL PERHAPS STAND OUT OF MY WAY AND LET ME GO TO MY WORK WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE BACKED UP AGAIN
WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MR MARSHALL
HE HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED MOREOVER TO DEPEND MUCH ON MR WATSON'S LEGAL ACUMEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSED AND BEWILDERED IF OBLIGED TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN ALL AT ONCE
NO INDEED HE REPLIED FRANKLY
EVERY WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE FETE IS NOW LINKED WITH US AS AN ALLY AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL RESENT THIS FOOLISH CIRCULAR I'M SORRY SAID KENNETH THAT YOU GIRLS SHOULD BE FORCED TO ENDURE THIS
THE MEETING WAS DISPOSED TO BE FAIR-MINDED AND QUITE WILLING TO GIVE MR FORBES A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION
IF THE YOUNG MAN AT ELMHURST WOULD LIKE TO BE OF PUBLIC SERVICE HE MIGHT FIND SOME BETTER WAY TO DO SO THAN BY ADVANCING SUCH CRAZY IDEAS
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA HE ASKED
THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES A CATCHWORD MR HOPKINS HAD EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN
NELL SAID IF IT WAS A MATTER O CHARITY I MUSTN'T TAKE A CENT HE OBSERVED IN A LOW VOICE
WHERE DO YOU THINK SHE CAN BE SIR HIS QUESTION WAS FULL OF AGONIZED ENTREATY AND HIS MANNER PITIFULLY APPEALING
BUT ANYHOW I HAVE A WISH TO KEEP THIS GIRL AT THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN STUDY HER CHARACTER THEN KEEP HER MY DEAR DECIDED KENNETH
IN THE SPRING KENNETH RETURNED WITH HIS GUARDIAN TO ELMHURST WHERE HE DEVOTED HIMSELF LARGELY TO PAINTING FROM THE SKETCHES HE HAD MADE ABROAD WHILE MR WATSON SAT BESIDE HIM COMFORTABLY SMOKING HIS PIPE AND READING HIS FAVORITE AUTHORS
HERE MY DEAR
IF YOU HAD WAITED LUCY WOULD HAVE PROVED HER INNOCENCE THEY THREATENED TO ARREST HER SIR
OF ALL THE EASY MARKS I EVER ENCOUNTERED MUTTERED MR MARSHALL THIS YOUNG FORBES IS THE EASIEST
WHAT A PRETTY BABY THAT IS
AND YOU'LL BOARD HERE OF COURSE THEN TOM GATES BROKE DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY LIKE A CHILD ALTHOUGH HE TRIED HARD TO CONTROL HIMSELF
I PUT ALL THE PAST BEHIND ME AND TOLD WILL ROGERS I WOULD MARRY HIM AND BE A FAITHFUL WIFE
I'D GIT INTO TROUBLE WITH THE SIGN-PAINTER WHO IS HE LIVES IN CLEVELAND
MERRICK--MERRICK HE REPEATED
I'M A COUSIN OF MR FORBES UP AT ELMHURST YOU KNOW
I'VE GOT HIS NAME UP T TH HOUSE IF YOU'LL COME ALONG
DON'T BOTHER TO READ IT AGAIN BUT EVERY WORD IS IMPORTANT DECLARED PATSY TURNING THE LETTER OVER EXCEPT THE LAST PAGE WITH A SWIFT FLUSH
DURING THIS ORATION BETH HAPPENED TO GLANCE UP AT THE HOUSE AND HER SHARP EYES DETECTED THE MAID ELIZA STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF-CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW
THE ELDER MAN WAS CONTENTED ENOUGH IN HIS CONDITION BUT THE BOY GREW RESTLESS AND IMPATIENT AND LONGED FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE
IT CAN'T BE BUT IT IS
I AM NOT ABLE SHE DECLARED
EVEN THE EAGLE EYE BREAKFAST FOOD WAS WELL REPRESENTED
MRS ROGERS FOLLOWED THE TALE WITH INTELLIGENT UNDERSTANDING AND HER JOY AT THE DISCOVERY OF HER WANDERING CHILD WAS ONLY TEMPERED BY THE FEAR THAT LUCY WOULD NEVER KNOW HER MOTHER AGAIN OR BE CONTENT TO REMAIN IN HER HUMBLE HOME
A WOMAN CAN'T KEEP A HOUSE NEAT AND TRIM LIKE THIS AND BE A SOCIAL GADDER HE OBSERVED
FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS BY DEPRIVING THEM OF THE INCOME DERIVED BY SELLING SPACES FOR ADVERTISING SIGNS
HOPKINS GAINED FOUR HERE SEVEN THERE AND TWENTY-TWO IN ANOTHER PRECINCT
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT DOC PATSY'S TOOTH WASN'T ACHING A BIT
DR SQUIERS WAS CORRECT IN SAYING THAT SUCH A CRIME WAS A STATE'S PRISON OFFENSE
WHY THIS ELECTION BUSINESS
DOZENS OF DESERVING YOUNG MEN WERE FURNISHED CAPITAL TO START THEM IN BUSINESS
WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS BETH WENT AT ONCE AND FOUND THE HOUSEKEEPER IN HER LITTLE ROOM
YOU WILL HAVE TO COME AROUND WEDNESDAY SAID MARSHALL FUSSILY
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED HORSES AND PREFER THEM TO MACHINES HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU PREPARED TO SPEND HOW MUCH--WHAT'S THAT HE ASKED BEWILDERED
BUT TELL ME HOW BIG IS YOUR DISTRICT IT INCLUDES PARTS OF THREE COUNTIES--MONROE WASHINGTON AND JACKSON COUNTIES WHAT COUNTY IS THIS MONROE ANY CITIES NO
THE--THE RIVER HAS A STRANGE FASCINATION FOR PEOPLE IN THAT CONDITION
AND YOU CAN WANDER AROUND THERE AND ENGAGE HER IN CONVERSATION EXCELLENT HE EXCLAIMED
THERE WAS NO OTHER CUSTOMER IN THE STORE
IS SUCH A CASE OF DEMENTIA HOPELESS MR BURKE NOT AT ALL HOPELESS
BE PATIENT A LITTLE WHILE AND AS SOON AS I FIND A WAY TO FREE YOU FROM ALL THIS TROUBLE I'LL SEND FOR YOU AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER TOGETHER WILL YOU KEEP MY SECRET DEMANDED ELIZA UNEASILY
THAT'S A LIE
A TERM SIGNIFYING THAT HE IS WILLING TO VOTE FOR ANY MEASURE THAT HE IS PAID TO VOTE FOR WHETHER IT BENEFITS HIS CONSTITUENTS OR NOT OH
HOPKINS ISN'T FIT TO BE THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THIS DISTRICT OBSERVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH SUDDEN ENERGY
HE WOULD THEN HAVE RETIRED BUT KENNETH WOULD NOT LET HIM GO
BUT DOC
WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS
I TRIED TO SING TOO FOR MY HEART WAS LIGHT AND GAY AND I WAS HAPPY
THE MATTER WAS REALLY SERIOUS BECAUSE EVERY VOTE LOST IN THAT WAY COUNTED AS TWO FOR THE OTHER SIDE AND HOPKINS'S RABID HAND-BILLS HAD INFLUENCED MANY OF THE MORE IGNORANT VOTERS AND CREATED ENDLESS DISPUTES THAT WERE NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
INTO SOCIETY AND SUCH LIKE VENTURED THE CALLER PRESENTLY
SHE READ HER LETTER IN BED AND BOUNCED OUT OF BED LIKE A CANNON-BALL
THEY TOOK US BY SURPRISE THE OTHER DAY AND STARTED A CAMPAIGN WORTHY OF OLD POLITICAL WAR-HORSES
THE CLUB IS TO MEET AT ELMHURST AND TO BE FED ON THE FAT OF THE LAND
BUT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN VERY STAUNCH FRIENDS
I HAVE NO SCAR ON MY LEFT ARM WILL YOU PROVE IT NO
HAS SHE BEEN DOING ANYTHING WRONG NO
THIS MEANS WORK SAID UNCLE JOHN SERIOUSLY
AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING
YET THOUGH THEY MET WITH MANY REBUFFS THEY MET VERY LITTLE DOWNRIGHT IMPERTINENCE
NOW THAT WE KNOW HER SECRET SHE SAID THE GIRL CANNOT CAUSE US MORE REAL HARM AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE
WHEN LAST EVENING
I MUST HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THESE THINGS ONCE
HE NEVER SPENT A PENNY ON ANYONE BUT HIMSELF AND BEING UNSCRUPULOUS IN POLITICS HE WAS NATURALLY UNSCRUPULOUS IN SMALLER THINGS OF A BUSINESS NATURE
WELL I BELIEVE WE'RE CAPABLE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK REPLIED BETH
PATSY ISN'T AT ALL PRETTY THIS MORNING
THE THING IS REALLY MORE SERIOUS THAN WE EXPECTED AND MORE DIFFICULT
THE SURPRISE WAS SO COMPLETE THAT THE AUDIENCE CHEERED SHOUTED AND LAUGHED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE SILENCE WAS RESTORED
THE RURAL DISTRICTS ARE THEIR STRONGHOLDS
I ENTERED THE YARD AND WENT AROUND TO THE BACK DOOR
IN MY EXPERIENCE WHICH COVERS MANY YEARS I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO STUDY SUDDEN DEMENTIA CAUSED BY SHOCKS OF GRIEF OR HORROR AND I HAVE COME TO COMPREHEND THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN MIND ONCE UNBALANCED IS LIABLE TO ACCOMPLISH MANY SURPRISING FEATS
KENNETH AND MR WATSON MET THEM IN SICILY AND AFTERWARD IN THE ITALIAN CITIES AND THE FRIENDSHIP ALREADY EXISTING BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE WAS MORE FIRMLY CEMENTED THAN BEFORE
I'LL EXPLAIN THE PROPOSITION SIR SO YOU WILL ALL UNDERSTAND IT HE REPLIED AND DREW HIS CHAIR INTO THE CIRCLE
I KNOW IT
FINALLY HE ASKED
THEN THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN THAT PUZZLED ME
SHE MADE NO STRUGGLE--NO ATTEMPT TO EVADE UNCONSCIOUSNESS HE ASKED
SOMEHOW SHE COULD NOT RID HERSELF OF THE IMPRESSION THAT WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING ELIZA TO BE THE MISSING LUCY SHE HAD STUMBLED UPON A SPHINX WHOSE RIDDLE WAS WELL WORTH SOLVING
YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO US MY DEAR THAT I FEEL YOU OUGHT TO KNOW I SHALL BE GLAD TO KNOW WHATEVER YOU CARE TO TELL ME SAID BETH SIMPLY
ISN'T THAT CORRECT ELIZA YES SIR--NO
MR HOPKINS WAS NOT GREATLY PLEASED THAT HIS CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ACCEPTED
IF I JUDGE RIGHT THERE'S SOME SIXTY PAGES IN THAT EPISTLE
VERY THOUGHTFULLY HE UNFOLDED THE MORNING PAPER AND THE NEXT MOMENT UTTERED A ROAR OF WRATH AND VEXATION
AND MUCH OBLIGED
YOU NEEDN'T ACCOUNT FOR IT
KENNETH ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A LAW PASSED PROHIBITING SUCH SIGNS EXPLAINED THE LAWYER
KENNETH WE CONGRATULATE YOU PATSY'S FACE WAS BURIED IN HER HANDKERCHIEF AND BETH'S GREAT EYES WERE BRIGHT WITH UNSHED TEARS
FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOM SAT IN SILENCE
MARY HOPKINS'S REQUESTS FOR NEW AND DECENT GOWNS WERE MORE OFTEN REFUSED THAN ACCEDED TO AND HE CONSTANTLY CAUTIONED HER TO KEEP DOWN EXPENSES OR SHE WOULD DRIVE THEM BOTH TO THE POOR-HOUSE
THEY HAD A GOOD MEETIN LAST NIGHT AND THERE'LL BE ANOTHER AT THE TOWN HALL NEXT WEEK PAH
NOW SHE IS--SHE WAS EIGHTEEN AND A WELL-DEVELOPED YOUNG WOMAN I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PICTURE SAID KENNETH
YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME AND IF THE CIGARS GIVE OUT DON'T HESITATE TO OPEN MORE BOXES
ERASTUS HOPKINS THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN ADVERTISING THESE THINGS HAD THEIR EFFECT UPON ALL CLASSES OF PEOPLE
YOU ARE VERY PRETTY ELIZA
LUCY'S ROOM WAS PREPARED IN THE EXACT MANNER IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT IT AND PRESENTLY THE VISITORS DROVE BACK TO ELMHURST
AS NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST HE WAS SENT OVER IN AN AUTOMOBILE AND ARRIVED AT THE MILL JUST BEFORE THE HOUR FOR CLOSING
IF I WERE A MAN I'D--I'D--BE PRESIDENT AN I'D VOTE FER YE TWENTY TIMES A DAY MAVOURNEEN CRIED THE MAJOR
IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE SIR
IF THEY KNEW YOU HAD DISCOVERED THE FALSE REGISTRATION OF THESE MEN THEY WOULD NEVER DARE VOTE THEM HOW WOULD IT BE TO SEND MR BURKE THE DETECTIVE OVER TO THE MILL TO TALK WITH MR MARSHALL SUGGESTED BETH
BUT THEY NATURALLY WOULD NOT FORCE THEMSELVES UPON THE SOCIETY OF THE ONE REALLY RICH MAN IN THEIR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY AS THAT MAN HAD SHOWN NO DESIRE TO KNOW THEM
THAT MAY BE POLITICS BUT IT AIN'T VERY RESPECTABLE TO MY NOTION WELL THE CAMPAIGN IS NEARLY OVER MRS HOPKINS THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT SHE REPLIED
UNCLE JOHN HAD SUGGESTED SERVING COFFEE TO THE VOTERS AT THE DIFFERENT POLLING PLACES AND KENNETH HAD THEREFORE ARRANGED FOR A BOOTH AT EACH PLACE WHERE EXCELLENT COFFEE WAS SERVED FREE ALL DAY LONG
FOR WHAT FOR FINDING ME SOMETHING TO DO
YOU'D THINK THESE MINXES WERE PREPARED FOR A TOUR OF THE WORLD
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HER THE PROTEST WAS PASSIONATE AND SINCERE AND LOUISE MARVELLED AT THE WORKINGS OF THIS EVIDENTLY UNBALANCED INTELLECT
HE SCOWLED AT EACH ONE BUT THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM QUITE SO INHARMONIOUS AS THOSE WHICH MARRED THE MORE PICTURESQUE AND RETIRED SPOTS WHICH WERE HIS FAVORITE HAUNTS
IT WAS A MERRY DINNER PARTY THAT GRACED THE TABLE DURING DINNER THAT EVENING AND THE BOY FORGOT HIS TROUBLES AND WAS AS JOLLY AND SOCIABLE AS HE HAD EVER BEEN IN HIS LIFE
SHE WILL BE HAPPIER TO DO SO I AM SURE OH NO CRIED THE GIRLS
HE BEGAN TO CIRCULATE HUMOROUS STORIES ABOUT KENNETH'S ANTIPATHY TO SIGN-BOARDS SAYING THAT THE YOUNG MAN DEMANDED THAT THE SIGNS BE TAKEN OFF THE ZODIAC AND THAT HE WOULDN'T BUY GOODS OF THE VILLAGE GROCER BECAUSE THE MAN HAD A SIGN OUT
I USED TO TAKE IN SEWING BEFORE THE ACCIDENT TO MY EYES AND THAT HELPED A GOOD DEAL TO PAY EXPENSES
WHEN KENNETH BECAME A LANDED PROPRIETOR MR WATSON WAS APPOINTED HIS GUARDIAN AND THE GENIAL OLD LAWYER ABANDONED THE PRACTICE OF LAW AND HENCEFORTH DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS WARD'S WELFARE AND SERVICE
AS MR HOPKINS HAD THRUST UPON HIS OPPONENT THE TASK OF NAMING THE PLACE AND TIME THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS AND PAY ALL THE COSTS
LOOK AT ME DEAR--I'M TOM
THE CHAIR ROCKED WITH LESS REGULARITY
REALLY MY DEARS I'M MORE PROUD OF YOU TODAY THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE HE CONCLUDED
PHYSICALLY HE WAS BIG AND STOUT WITH A FLORID FACE AND SMALL EYES THAT BLINKED CONTINUALLY
THE FARMER RODE A TIME IN SILENT THOUGHT
DON'T I BEG OF YOU CRIED ELIZA STARTING UP
THEN THEY BEGAN PAINTING THEIR ADVERTISING ON YOUR FENCES
IS THIS MRS ROGERS ASKED BETH LOOKING AT THE WOMAN CURIOUSLY
THAT IS ALL
AND I'M SURE YOU ARE AS GOOD AS YOU'RE PRETTY ANNOUNCED LOUISE
OH HOW HAPPY AND GAY I WAS IN THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS
WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM I'M INTERESTED IN THE BOY AND WANT TO SAVE HIM FROM PROSECUTION HE'S A FORGER MR FORBES
AND THEN HE BEGAN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL QUESTIONS IN GENERAL AND HIS OWN MERITS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT KENNETH AND MR WATSON DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HAD CAPTURED THE MEETING LEFT THE SCHOOL-HOUSE AND INDIGNANTLY RETURNED TO ELMHURST
HE WAS OF STURDY ATHLETIC BUILD AND DRESSED NEATLY IN A SUIT THAT WAS OF COARSE MATERIAL BUT WELL BRUSHED AND CARED FOR
HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS MR FORBES'S SECRETARY NOW AND THAT MR FORBES MIGHT WANT HIM
IF THERE'S NOTHING YOU WANT I'VE GOT A PRESCRIPTION TO FILL MR HOPKINS WALKED OUT MOODILY
DON'T THEY OWN THE SPACES NOW THEY DID
AND SHE NEVER DID A THING THAT WOULD CAUSE ANYONE THE LEAST WORRY OR UNHAPPINESS
TELL US ABOUT IT SAID PATSY
FOR THE LIKENESS TO MRS ROGERS WAS SOMETHING AMAZING
MY DEAR I HAVEN'T ANOTHER ONE TO GIVE YOU AND MY LEGS ARE TOO TOTTERING TO BE OF ANY USE
WELL THEN WHAT'S TO BE DONE THE QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED TO PATSY WHO WAS NOT PREPARED TO REPLY
CHAPTER X THE FORGED CHECK KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MR WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
I CAN'T BE BOTHERED THIS WAY ANYHOW I AM KENNETH FORBES OF ELMHURST
BUT ONE CAN'T BE HERE WITHOUT KNOWING THE NAMES OF THE YOUNG LADIES SO I RECOGNIZE YOU AS MISS BETH ONE OF MR FORBES'S COUSINS YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY
ARE THE THINGS WE PRIZE
BUT THERE WAS A CHILL IN THE AIR THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF WINTER
KENNETH WAS THE SUBJECT OF MUCH SPECULATION AMONG THEM AND OPINIONS WIDELY DIFFERED CONCERNING HIS CHARACTER
AS A GIRL I WAS CONSIDERED ATTRACTIVE AND MY FATHER WAS A MAN OF GREAT WEALTH AND SOCIAL STANDING
HE WAS FAR TOO SHREWD TO BECOME THE PREY OF DESIGNING PEOPLE BUT WELCOMED ANY LEGITIMATE CHANNEL IN WHICH TO UNLOAD HIS SURPLUS
NOTHING SEEMS TO INFLUENCE ME SO STRONGLY AS MY OWN WHIMS
THEN DR HOYT TOOK UP THE CONVERSATION AND RELATED THE MANY INSTANCES OF COMPLETE RECOVERY THAT HAD COME UNDER HIS OBSERVATION
I DUNNO RAST
TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY AND IF A TOOTHACHE HADN'T CARRIED YOU TO THE DENTIST'S OFFICE KENNETH WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN DEFEATED AND WE'D NEVER HAVE KNOWN HOW IT HAPPENED DECLARED UNCLE JOHN
IT'S A RELIEF TO HAVE A QUIET HOUSE FOR A DAY ISN'T IT SHE ASKED EATING HER SOUP CALMLY
BETH WAS FULL OF CURIOSITY TO KNOW THIS STORY
COME IN SHE REPLIED TARTLY
THE VISITORS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT PROVE TO BE WOULD AFFORD RELIEF TO THE SITUATION AND BRIGHTEN THE DULLNESS OF LIFE AT THE BIG HOUSE
THEY DON'T TRY TO ROAST YOU
BETH THOUGHT HIS APPEARANCE PLEASING AND MANLY
THE HOUSE WAS PACKED FULL OF EAGER SPECTATORS WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE FUN ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS THEY HAD DEVOTED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AMPLE STAGE TO THE USE OF THE HOPKINS PARTY WHERE A SPEAKER'S TABLE AND CHAIRS FOR IMPORTANT GUESTS HAD BEEN PLACED
BUT SOON HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE AND PROUD OF THEIR TALENTS
THEN SHE RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY FOR MR BURKE AND LED HIM TOWARD THE SAME PLACE
SO WE FIND THAT THE MONEY RECEIVED BY THE FARMERS FROM THE ADVERTISING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF ONE PER CENT OF THEIR INCOME A MATTER SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT IT CANNOT AFFECT THEM MATERIALLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
LOUISE WAS THE ELDEST--A FAIR DAINTY CREATURE WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE AIR WHICH INVARIABLY WINS THE ADMIRING REGARD OF ALL BEHOLDERS
I DO NOT THINK SHE DID SIR ARE YOU ACCUSTOMED TO HIRING MAIDS WITHOUT RECOMMENDATIONS ASKED MR BURKE
YES INDEED SAID MRS HOPKINS PLEASED TO HAVE MADE AN IMPRESSION
BUT HE NEEDN'T HAVE BEEN SO DISAGREEABLE HE'S A DISAGREEABLE MAN AT ANY TIME RETURNED MR ANDREWS
CHAPTER XV SIGNS OF THE TIMES IF SHE IS REALLY LUCY ROGERS SHE'LL BE MISSING TOMORROW MORNING SAID BETH WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER COUSINS OF THE ENCOUNTER IN THE CORRIDOR
HE HAD ONE GOOD AND HELPFUL FRIEND AN OLD LAWYER NAMED WATSON WHO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN A FRIEND OF HIS UNCLE AND THE CONFIDANT OF AUNT JANE FOR YEARS BUT HAD TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE LONELY BOY AND HAD DONE HIS BEST TO MAKE HIS LIFE BRIGHTER AND HAPPIER
AND I THINK YOU ARE ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES FROM ELMHURST--PERHAPS THE ONE WILL TALKED TO YOU ARE RIGHT MRS ROGERS
BUT I IMAGINE SHE'LL TRY TO AND IF DAN DOESN'T GIVE IN MRS SIMMONS WILL PROBABLY MAKE HIS LIFE MISERABLE FOR A TIME
THE NOBLEST STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN IT WOULD BROADEN YOU TO GO INTO POLITICS FOR A TIME AND DO MUCH TO DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTER AND RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF YOUR EXISTENCE KENNETH FROWNED
ERASTUS HAD HURRIED AWAY TO A MEETING OF HIS HENCHMEN IN THE TOWN AND WOULD NOT BE HOME UNTIL AFTER HIS WIFE WAS IN BED
DON'T GIVE IN I WON'T TOM
BUT RECOVERY IS NOT ALWAYS ASSURED
YOU ARE A VALUABLE MAN IN THIS COMMUNITY MR MARSHALL AND MR FORBES SEEMED TO THINK THE HOPKINS PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET YOU INTO TROUBLE
WHEN AFTER A TIME SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN ELIZA WAS SLOWLY ROCKING BACK AND FORTH AND CHEWING THE CONFECTION
SHE WAS SUCH A GENTLE SHRINKING GIRL AS SHY AND RETIRING AS A CHILD
I DO
HE BUYS HIS CIGARS OF THOMPSON THE GENERAL STORE MAN AND I KEEP THE FINEST LINE EVER BROUGHT TO THIS TOWN OH THAT REMINDS ME EXCLAIMED PATSY
WE ARE HAVING A JOLLY CAMPAIGN MY DEAR FRIENDS HE BEGAN
INDEED THE GATHERING HAD AT FIRST THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A POLITICAL ONE SO ENTIRELY DID THE REPRESENTATIVE DOMINATE IT
AND FROM THE MOMENT SHE LEFT HER HOME ALL TRACE OF HER WAS LOST ONE WOULD THINK OBSERVED KENNETH THAT A POOR DEMENTED GIRL WANDERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY WOULD BE NOTICED BY SCORES OF PEOPLE
THESE SIXTY-SIX FOR ME WOULD WIPE THAT OUT AND LET US WIN IN A WALK WHEN HOPKINS CEASED THERE WAS A BRIEF SILENCE
THIS IS THE MORE DISCOURAGING BECAUSE MR FORBES HAS SPENT SO MUCH MONEY WHILE HOPKINS'S EXPENSES HAVE BEEN VERY LITTLE I DO NOT MIND THAT SAID KENNETH QUIETLY
BETTER GET TO BED AND SLEEP FOR YOU'RE TIRED OUT
YES YOU DO DOC
THERE ARE A HUNDRED WAYS TO DO THAT MENTION A FEW PROPOSED THE MAJOR
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGED
P
DON'T YOU KNOW ME HE ASKED HIS VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION
EITHER IT WAS LUCY OR HER GHOST HE MUTTERED
I CAN WRITE SING AND SEW--I SEW REMARKABLY WELL AND MUST HAVE ONCE BEEN TRAINED TO IT
BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD GLOOMILY
HE SAT QUIETLY IN HIS CHAIR AND WATCHED HER WORK
BRING HIM HERE JAMES PLEASE SAID THE GIRL
THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME UNHAPPY NOW IS THE HORROR THAT THIS PAST LIFE WILL BE THRUST UPON ME
WELL IT'S TRUE
CHAPTER XII BETH MEETS A REBUFF THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GROWING WARM
I'LL FURNISH YOU A HORSE AND BUGGY AND YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND AND TALK WITH PEOPLE AND TRY TO FIND LUCY AT THE SAME TIME
IF I CAN GET KENNETH INTERESTED THIS PLAN OF MINE WILL BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO HIM THEN HE TOO LEFT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND WANDERING INTO THE GARDEN SAW KENNETH BUSY AT HIS EASEL IN A SHADY CORNER
AND YOU PERMITTED THESE VILE SIGNS TO BE PAINTED ON THE ROCKS DEMANDED THE BOY ANGRILY
BUT WE MUSTN'T LOSE ANY TIME IF WE'RE GOING TO DIRECT THE POLITICS OF THE EIGHTH DISTRICT ELECTION THE EIGHTH OF NOVEMBER I CAN GO ANY TIME AND SO CAN BETH SAID LOUISE
EF I KIN GET A-HOLD O ANY O THET MONEY HONEST I WANT TO DO IT HAVE YOU GOT A HORSE ASKED KENNETH
AND NOW WE MUST FIND THE GIRL YES REPLIED THE BOY CHEERFULLY WE MUST FIND LUCY CHAPTER XI A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE A WOMAN WAS SITTING IN A LOW ROOM ENGAGED IN KNITTING
COULD YOU HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN PERSISTED THE QUESTIONER
SQUIERS PROBABLY REGISTERED EM ALL RIGHT AND THEY'LL PROBABLY VOTE FOR HOPKINS WAIT A MOMENT SIR CRIED ERASTUS AS UNCLE JOHN WAS TURNING AWAY
THEY WANT MONEY
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE THESE SIXTY-SIX VOTES WILL TURN THE SCALE ASKED DR SQUIERS
EVEN IF SHE WERE BUT A PAID SPY OF ERASTUS HOPKINS THERE WAS A STORY IN THIS GIRL'S LIFE BRIEF AS IT HAD BEEN
BUT I CAN'T FIND THAT HE'S EVER GIVEN MUCH OF IT BACK THAT'S TRUE
IT BELONGS TO WHOEVER GETS THE VOTES WELL THAT'S HOPKINS
THE LITTLE TOWN OF ELMWOOD WAS QUIET AND PRACTICALLY DESERTED WHEN THEY DROVE INTO IT
SUPPOSE YOU RESIGN AS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS SAID KENNETH BEGINNING TO BE AMUSED
HOW FAR ARE YOU PREPARED TO GO IN THIS MATTER SIR IN WHAT WAY IN EXPENDING MONEY WILL ANY LARGE EXPENDITURE BE REQUIRED I CANNOT SAY
BUT HIS HOME WHICH HE AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HAD LITTLE SHARE IN HIS PERSONAL PROSPERITY
SHE'S TOO RED AND FRECKLED PATSY LAUGHED AND HER BLUE EYES DANCED
AND SHE WOULDN'T TREAT ME THAT WAY EITHER MISS BETH
THAT WAS BEFORE EITHER OF US KNEW SHE WAS EMPLOYED AT ELMHURST
SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT
TELL ME ABOUT IT DEAR I CAN'T
AND HERE'S A CHECK FOR YOUR TWO-FIFTY IN ADVANCE THE EDITOR DREW UP THE AGREEMENT WITH A PEN THAT TREMBLED A LITTLE
HAD TO SEND TO CHICAGO FOR SOME OF THESE RUSH JOB YES SIR
BUT WHEN THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED IN THE LONG LIVING ROOM WHERE THEY GROUPED THEMSELVES AROUND THE FIREPLACE A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN THE DEMEANOR OF THE YOUNG LADIES
MR HOPKINS ALSO PRINTED THOUSANDS OF LARGE HAND-BILLS READING THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES VS
BUT HE DIDN'T INTEND TO TAKE CHANCES SO HE BEGAN THE CAMPAIGN WITH HIS USUAL VIGOR
MARSHALL COULD HAVE GOT ME A HUNDRED IF NECESSARY BUT SIXTY-SIX IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
BUT HIS FOLKS IS AS POOR AS WE ARE SO THE YOUNG UNS HAD TO WAIT
I'LL GO AND ASK HER I'D BETTER SHOW YOU THE WAY MISS
BUT SHE WASN'T
WHEN SHE RAPPED UPON THE DOOR A SWEET QUIET VOICE SAID
I'M BUSY PERHAPS THE POLITICIAN HAD NEVER BEEN SO SURPRISED IN HIS LIFE
DESPAIR WON'T HELP YOU
MRS ROGERS ROSE AT DAYLIGHT AND WITH OLD WILL'S ASSISTANCE PREPARED THE BREAKFAST
THAT'S THEIR CLEVERNESS
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT HOPKINS WAS SAYING IN A BLUSTERING IMPERIOUS VOICE
SO HE ASSUMED A VIRTUOUS LOOK AND REPLIED
SOME COSTUMES ADVERTISED BAKING-POWDERS OTHERS PATENT MEDICINES OTHERS SOAPS CHEWING TOBACCO BREAKFAST FOODS ETC
BUT HER MANNER IS NOT THE SAME AT ALL
THE CAMPAIGN WAS HOT AGAINST HIM BUT KENNETH MADE NO DEFENSE
IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH THE STRUGGLE BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF BEATEN PROTESTED KENNETH ALMOST READY TO WEEP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE IS ALSO WELL AND HEALTHY TO ALL APPEARANCES
ONLY A FEW TOWNS
IF YOU KNEW LUCY SIR YOU'D REALIZE HOW STRANGE IT IS WENT ON YOUNG GATES EARNESTLY
LUCY DREW WILL AND ME A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER BUT HE NEVER RECOVERED HIS YOUTHFUL AMBITION
THAT COULD NOT BE DENIED
AND SHE HASN'T BEEN FOUND YET WE CAN'T TRACE HER ANYWHERE AN NELL HAS BROKE DOWN AT LAS AN DON'T DO MUCH BUT CRY
SO WILL I SAID BETH
AS I WALKED DOWN THE STREET I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM ONE OF THE CHIMNEYS AND IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WAS HUNGRY
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTEEN DOLLARS A YEAR EACH IF YOU'LL LET ME WASH OFF THE LETTERS AND RESTORE THE SCENE TO ITS ORIGINAL BEAUTY HE DECLARED
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT THERE
THE RIGHT SIDE WAS SIMILARLY ARRANGED FOR THE FORBES PARTY AND BETWEEN THE TWO THE ENTIRE CENTER OF THE STAGE WAS OCCUPIED BY A GROUP OF FIFTY YOUNG GIRLS
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU I WILL GO SAID BETH A LITTLE FRIGHTENED AT THE PASSIONATE APPEAL
HE TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD BUT THE POPULAR FANCY HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE OBJECT LESSON SO CLEVERLY PLACED BEFORE THEM AND THEY SHOUTED
THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE HAD GIVEN MR FORBES A TABLE SHOWING WHAT THE VOTE OF EACH PRECINCT SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THEIR CANVASS
TEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ROCK AS BIG AS A BARN BUT THEY RENT THOUSANDS OF SUCH POSITIONS AND IN THE AGGREGATE OUR FARMERS GET LARGE SUMS FROM THEM AND RUIN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR HOMES AND FARMS MR WATSON SMILED
I'M YOUR OWN TOM LUCY IT'S VERY GRATIFYING I'M SURE YOUNG MAN SAID THE GIRL A TOUCH OF SCORN IN HER TONES
TAKING ALL THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONNECT THE TWO GIRLS IN ANY WAY--SAVE THE COINCIDENCE OF PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE MR BURKE LISTENED TO THIS QUIETLY AND THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER SINCE THE DAY SHE CAME HERE TO SEE ME--RIGHT AFTER MY ARREST THEY DID NOT THINK BEST TO ENLIGHTEN HIM AT THAT TIME
AND YOU GIRLS PROPOSE TO SIT DOWN AND ALLOW ALL THIS INQUIRED THEIR UNCLE STERNLY
I'M NOT AFRAID OF A BOY WHO BECAME A CRIMINAL TO SAVE THE GIRL HE LOVED BUT ALL THE WORLD KNOWS OF HIS CRIME SHE EXCLAIMED
I MAY SAY WITHOUT DANGER OF CONTRADICTION THAT THE PEOPLE I HAVE THE HONOR TO REPRESENT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND EXPECT TO HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE NEXT TERM ARE THE MOST INTELLIGENT THE MOST THOUGHTFUL AND THE MOST PROSPEROUS TO BE FOUND IN ANY LIKE DISTRICT IN THE UNITED STATES
AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION THE MILL WAS AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN
HE SEEMED MUCH AMUSED AT THE EARNESTNESS OF THIS GIRLISH CHAMPION OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
STANDING BEFORE HER WAS THE YOUNG GIRL SHE HAD SEEN RIDING WITH MR HOPKINS--THE GIRL SHE HAD DECLARED TO BE THE MISSING DAUGHTER OF MRS ROGERS
HIS ONE FRIEND WAS MAJOR DOYLE PATSY'S FATHER A DIGNIFIED BUT AGREEABLE OLD IRISH GENTLEMAN WHO AMUSED UNCLE JOHN NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DELIGHTED HIM
KENNETH HAD BEEN THEIR GUIDE AND COMPANION IN THESE VARIOUS EXPLORATIONS BUT WHEN THE GIRLS WENT TO THEIR ROOMS HE WANDERED INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE UNCLE JOHN AND MR WATSON HAD BEEN HAVING A QUIET TALK OVER THEIR PIPES OF TOBACCO
WE WON IN ELMWOOD ANYHOW AND HOPKINS ISN'T AHEAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY AS THE THING STANDS NOW
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEY COULD BE THE SAME WHY NOT ASKED MR BURKE
TO BE PATIENT UNDER THE TORTURE OF A TOOTHACHE WAS A VIRTUE PATSY DID NOT POSSESS
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD AND I CLAIMED IT FOR MY NAME AND HAVE CLUNG TO IT EVER SINCE HAVE YOU NO IDEA WHAT YOUR REAL NAME IS ASKED LOUISE GREATLY INTERESTED IN THIS TERSE RELATION
HE'S GONE BACK INTO HIS SHELL LIKE A TURTLE AN WON'T COME OUT TO FIGHT
DID YE EVER HEAR O LUCY NO MR ROGERS LUCY'S OUR GIRL--THE ON'Y CHICK ER CHILD WE EVER HAD
YOUR ARGUMENTS ALL TEND TO MAKE ME SUSPECT THAT SHE IS LUCY ROGERS HE SAID QUIETLY
DON'T YOU THINK IT BETTER TO VOTE FOR THE BEST MAN RATHER THAN THE BEST PARTY IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHY PERHAPS IT IS
ALL YOU'LL NEED TO DO IS TO EXERCISE YOUR WITS AND WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE
MARSHALL THE MANAGER OF THE MILL
YOU CAN'T BE LUCY HE MURMURED
BUT YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT SAID PATSY DECIDEDLY
I THINK SO SAID MR WATSON
THE LITTLE MAN WAS PATIENT
SHE HID THE RING IN A VASE ON THE MANTLE AND THEY FOUND IT AFTER SHE WAS GONE WELL WELL
THE MANAGER WAS IN KENNETH AND BETH LEARNED BUT COULD NOT SEE THEM UNTIL HE HAD SIGNED THE LETTERS HE HAD DICTATED FOR THE NOON MAIL
HIS OWN FIRM HE SAID BOUGHT THOUSANDS OF BUSHELS OF OATS FROM THE FARMERS AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE CELEBRATED EAGLE-EYE BREAKFAST FOOD THREE PACKAGES FOR A QUARTER
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL IT'S LUCY ROGERS SURE ENOUGH SAID KENNETH
YOU MUST GO TO WORK I WILL
GOT A BIG JOB IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD PRETTY BIG SIR WHO'S YOUR FOREMAN SMITH
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I'LL FIND MR FORBES HE'S GETTING READY FOR DINNER NOW AND WON'T NEED YOU AT PRESENT THEN I'LL GO BACK TO MY ROOM
WHY THE FARMERS OF OTHER SECTIONS WOULD GET THAT MUCH MORE MONEY FOR LETTING PRIVILEGES AND YOU WOULD BE THAT MUCH OUT OF POCKET WITHOUT SUPPRESSING THE EVIL--IF EVIL CAN ATTACH TO AN INDUSTRY THAT PAYS YOU GOOD MONEY WITHOUT REQUIRING EITHER INVESTMENT OR LABOR IN RETURN AFTER CONTINUING IN THIS STRAIN FOR SOME TIME MR HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD NOW GIVE WAY TO HIS YOUTHFUL AND INEXPERIENCED OPPONENT AND ASKED THE AUDIENCE TO BE PATIENT WITH MR FORBES AND CONSIDERATE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY PREJUDICES HOPKINS'S POLICY OF DISCREDITING HIS OPPONENT IN ADVANCE WAS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE FOR WHEN KENNETH AROSE HE WAS MORE ENTHUSIASTICALLY CHEERED THAN HOPKINS HAD BEEN
AND YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THIS A SECRET AND NOT LET ANYONE KNOW OF YOUR TROUBLE SUDDENLY SHE STARTED AND SPRANG AWAY UTTERING A CRY OF TERROR
IN HIS PRIVATE OFFICE WERE LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONES A DIRECT CONNECTION WITH THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR AT THE STATION AND OTHER FACILITIES FOR ACCOMPLISHING BUSINESS PROMPTLY
BUT I MAY SAY THE EXPOSURE OF THE PLOT OCCURRED THROUGH MR HOPKINS'S OWN CARELESSNESS
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
I DON'T LIKE TO BE BEATEN
LUCY COULD HAVE LOOKED AFTER HER MOTHER SAID YOUNG BATES BUT OLD WILL WAS STUBBORN AND WOULDN'T LET HER
NO DEAR
THERE WERE MANY GOOD-NATURED LAUGHS AT YOUNG FORBES'S EXPENSE
DON'T WORRY PLEASE
A MAN NAMED CUMMINGS WAS THE REPUBLICAN AND SETH REYNOLDS THE LIVERYMAN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE
THEN THE TELEPHONE HAVING SERVED ITS PURPOSE MR WARREN TOOK UNCLE JOHN ACROSS THE STREET TO THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE AND INTRODUCED HIM TO CHARLEY BRIGGS THE EDITOR
HE WAS HIMSELF A LARGE STOCKHOLDER IN A BREAKFAST-FOOD FACTORY WHICH PAINTED SIGNS WHEREVER IT COULD SECURE SPACE
MR HOPKINS SLATES THAT THE FARMERS OF THIS DISTRICT RECEIVED THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THREE DOLLARS DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR ADVERTISING SIGNS
WAIT A MOMENT PLEASE HE SAID DETAINING HER
I'VE JUST STOPPED SMOKING A FEW DAYS AGO AND IT'S GOT ON MY NERVES SOMETHING AWFUL MAY WE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
MR FORBES WANTED ME TO PURCHASE A BOX OF YOUR CHOICEST BRAND AND HAVE YOU JUST HAND THEM OUT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS
HE HAS BEEN RELEASED RELEASED
AND--I HAVE A FEELING I WAS NOT HAPPY BEFORE--BEFORE BEFORE WHAT DEAR THE GIRL LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND HER FACE GREW RED
INDEED HE WAS SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HIMSELF REFERRED TO THE SUBJECT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
I GUESS HE'LL WIN
I'LL MAKE IT THREE THOUSAND DOC IF YOU DON'T CLOSE WITH ME RAST BY THE JUMPING JUPITER I'LL MAKE IT FOUR THOUSAND CRIED THE DENTIST WITH EXASPERATION
ACT AS YOU THINK BEST I THANK YOU REPLIED DR HOYT BOWING
PLEASE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HE MAY ASK YOU YES MASTER KENNETH DID THE GIRL BRING ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ASKED THE DETECTIVE
ONE MORNING SHE TRIED TO LIGHT THE FIRE WITH KEROSENE AND LOST HER SIGHT
JUST NOW A SHADOW CAST FROM THE OTHER ROOM WAVERED AN INSTANT OVER THE RUG AND LOUISE'S QUICK EYES CAUGHT IT
COME THIS WAY PLEASE THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES
BETH'S FATHER WAS A GENIUS AND A PROFESSOR OF MUSIC--ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES WHO LIVE ONLY IN THEIR OWN ATMOSPHERE AND FORGET THERE IS A WORLD AROUND THEM
FORBES HAS BOUGHT YOU UP I SEE
AND THEY'VE BOUGHT UP THOMPSON
AND DO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT DEAR SHE KNOWS SIXTY PAGES ABOUT IT REPLIED MAJOR DOYLE
THE BUTLER ANNOUNCED DINNER BUT ONLY LOUISE AND MR WATSON COULD EAT ANYTHING
HE IS ROBBING THE FARMERS WHILE CLAIMING HE WANTS TO BEAUTIFY THEIR HOMES
BUT IF YOU OBJECT TO THIS PLAN I DON'T
WHAT ON EARTH COULD POSSESS THE YOUNG UN FROM ELMHURST TO OBJECT TO SIGNS AND BE WILLING TO PAY FOR HAVING THEM ERASED
THESE GENTLEMEN WERE MUCH WORRIED OVER THE DISCOVERY OF A SCHEME TO TRADE VOTES THAT HAD BEEN SPRUNG AND THAT FORBES AND REYNOLDS WERE BEING SACRIFICED FOR HOPKINS AND CUMMINGS
I AM ADOPTING HEROIC METHODS IN THIS CASE SAID HE BUT I HAVE REASONABLE HOPES OF THEIR SUCCESS
SHE IS--SHE WAS VERY LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG REPLIED THE WOMAN
THEY SAY MISS AS YOU FOLKS IS A-SPENDIN UV A LOT O MONEY ON THIS ELECTION A-GITTIN VOTES AN SICH LIKE HE SAID IN AN ALTERED TONE
THE BAND PLAYED BRISKLY AND BEFORE NOON THE SCENE WAS ONE OF GREAT ANIMATION
THE SUN WAS JUST RISING AND NO ONE WAS NEAR
THERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER ON THE WALL THERE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS
I LIKE A GOOD FIGHT HE SAID WISTFULLY
NOW IN ORDER TO EFFECT A RECOVERY I HAVE REVERSED THESE EXPERIENCES WITH HER
HE PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES AND GAVE A SHUDDER
IT'LL KILL HIS CHANCES--IF HE EVER HAD ANY STRANGE MUSED THE SENATOR
BUT THEN HE PROVED TO ME THERE WAS SOME TRUTH IN HIS STATEMENT
WE'VE GOT ALL WE CAN HANDLE HERE FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS IT'S GOT TO BE DONE QUICK OR NOT AT ALL
THE NEX DAY TOM WERE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD
THEY WAITED GOOD-NATUREDLY HOWEVER GROUPING THEMSELVES IN THE BIG YARD
ABOUT THE TIME THAT LUCY WENT AWAY YOU APPEARED AT ELMHURST CONTINUED TOM
I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO GIVE YOU THE DETAILS
HE FOLLOWED THE BANKER INTO HIS PRIVATE OFFICE AND TOLD HIM BRIEFLY HIS INTENTION TO FORWARD THE INTERESTS OF HIS YOUNG FRIEND KENNETH FORBES FOR MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE
IT'S NEARLY TWO WEEKS NOW
DID IT HURT MUCH MISS PATSY DID WHAT HURT JAMES THE TOOTH PULLIN MISS PATSY THE TOOTH WASN'T PULLED ANSWERED THE GIRL SWEETLY
HIS HEART DECLARED THAT SHE WAS LUCY AND HIS HEAD REALIZED THAT SHE COULD NOT BE
SIR YOU WRONG ME
WELL WELL LET'S THINK IT OVER KEN AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
HE HAD AT ONCE RETIRED FROM ACTIVE BUSINESS AND INVESTED HIS MILLIONS IN WAYS THAT WOULD CAUSE HIM THE LEAST ANNOYANCE
OFTEN I ADMIT IT DEVELOPS INTO PERMANENT INSANITY BUT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF COMPLETE RECOVERY
WHEN I CAME TO ELMHURST I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND ABOUT MR FORBES BUT COULD NOT CONNECT THEM WITH MY FORMER LIFE HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO COME HERE ASKED LOUISE
HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD THERE WHISTLING FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT A WORD
BUT SOME DAY THEY'LL PUT HIM OUT NECK AND CROP IF HE AIN'T CAREFUL IS THE GIRL ELIZA MUCH USE TO HIM I CAN'T SAY
LET'S ALL GO UNCLE AND TRY TO CHEER HIM UP BY THIS TIME UNCLE JOHN WAS SMILING GENIALLY
BUT WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER INTO THE SIDE STREET WHERE THE LIVERY WAS LOCATED HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND A ROW OF HORSES AND WAGONS LINING EACH SIDE OF THE STREET AND IN EACH VEHICLE TWO MEN IN WHITE JUMPERS AND OVERALLS
YOU KNOW MISS I HAVEN'T ANYTHING AGAINST MR FORBES MYSELF
LOUISE LOOKED AT MR BURKE
LET ME WIN THE WOMEN AND I'LL WIN THE MEN WHAT AM I TO DO ASKED BETH
I KNOW HOW TO MANAGE MEN OF HIS SORT VERY GOOD APPROVED THE LAWYER AND I'LL SEE SQUIERS IF YOU DO SAID PATSY JUST ASK HIM TO SIGN A PAPER SAYING THAT LUCY ROGERS WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF STEALING THE RING AND THAT HIS MOTHER FOUND IT IN A VASE WHERE SHE HAD FORGOTTEN SHE PUT IT I'LL DO THAT REPLIED MR WATSON
FOR IT ISOLATED HIM AND DEPRIVED HIM OF ANY SOCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH HIS NEIGHBORS
YOU--YOU WANT TO RUIN ME FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH THEY STOOD IN THE CORNER OF THE GARDEN WITH HIGH HEDGES BEHIND THE MAID AND MR BURKE AND LOUISE BLOCKING THE PATH IN FRONT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF ESCAPE
BUT IN IMPORTANT THINGS SUCH AS THIS HE'S SURE TO LISTEN TO YOU
BUT YOU'RE THE CLERK OF THE ELECTION SQUIERS
YET THE THING MIGHT NOT BE SO IMPORTANT AS MRS HOPKINS FEARED
I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES WHERE EVERY RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST WAS WIPED OUT OF THE PATIENT'S MIND THERE WAS ANOTHER THOUGHTFUL PAUSE FOR THE DETECTIVE'S ASSERTIONS WERE SO ASTONISHING THAT THEY FAIRLY OVERWHELMED HIS HEARERS
THE WOMAN'S EYES WERE CLOSED BUT THE LASHES FELL IN GRACEFUL DARK CURVES OVER HER WITHERED CHEEKS
BOTH THE LEMONADE AND THE SANDWICHES HAD BEEN DOSED BY DR HOYT
MY YOUNG FRIEND FORBES IS TRYING TO GET ELECTED HIMSELF AND YOU CAN'T BOTH WIN OH YES
THE GIRLS BEAT YOU ON THAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN SIGNS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WORSE
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HERSELF
WHO WILL EMPLOY A BOOKKEEPER OR EVEN A CLERK WHO HAS BEEN GUILTY OF FORGERY I THINK I SHALL GIVE HIM EMPLOYMENT REPLIED KENNETH
THESE MEETINGS ARE EDUCATIONAL TO YOUNG MEN
ABOUT SIXTY-SIX MR HOPKINS GAVE A START AND TURNED RED
WHILE HE SAT ON HIS MARE CONSIDERING THE MATTER THE MAN WITH THE LAME HORSE WHOM HE HAD PASSED OVERTOOK HIM
AND HE TOOK A HAND IN THE FIGHT HIMSELF
THEY TELL WHAT FORBES CAN DO WITH ALL HIS MONEY IF HE'S REPRESENTATIVE AND THEY SWEAR HE'LL DO IT NEVER MIND SAID HOPKINS EASILY
DON'T REMEMBER ELIZA
I'LL MAKE YOU A PROPOSITION
SOON IT CAME TO A STOP AND ELIZA WAS PEACEFULLY SLEEPING IN ITS AMPLE DEPTHS
BUT TO HAVE HER DISAPPEAR AND NOT KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER--WHETHER SHE IS LIVING MISERABLY OR LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER--IT IS THIS THAT IS DRIVING ME DISTRACTED KENNETH AND BETH REMAINED SILENT FOR A TIME AFTER MRS ROGERS HAD FINISHED HER TRAGIC STORY FOR THEIR HEARTS WERE FULL OF SYMPATHY FOR THE POOR WOMAN
I'VE HIRED EVERYTHING TO BE HAD IN TOWN FOR THIS SIGN-PAINTING GANG BUT MR HOPKINS WAS NOT TO BE BALKED
YOU SEE EXPLAINED UNCLE JOHN THE THING LOOKED AS BIG AS A BALLOON TO US AT FIRST
BY THAT TIME HE HAD COME TO DETEST THE UNSIGHTLY ADVERTISEMENTS THAT CONFRONTED HIM EVERY TIME HE RODE OUT AND HE BEGAN A WAR OF EXTERMINATION AGAINST THEM QUITE RIGHT SAID PATSY NODDING ENERGETICALLY
I WILL WHEN I GET TO ELMHURST AND LOOK OVER THE GROUND ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN
SO WE LAID PLANS FER ME TO COME HERE TODAY
HE REALLY HATES HIM
AND THEY MUST ADVERTISE OR THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR PRODUCTS LET THEM ADVERTISE IN DECENT WAYS THEN
HE ASKED THEM TO OBSERVE WEBB'S PRETTY HOMESTEAD NO LONGER MARRED BY THE UNSIGHTLY SIGN UPON THE BARN
ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED ACRES SAID MR WATSON
YOU WON'T VOTE THE MILL HANDS NOT A MAN SHALL VOTE WHO IS NOT PROPERLY REGISTERED I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT MR HOPKINS
WHY THE ANTI-SIGN FIGHT HAS WON IN SEVERAL PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND LOCAL LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED PROHIBITING THEM
IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS ADVERTISEMENT
YOU SEE MR FORBES THINKS MR SIMMONS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEN IN THIS DISTRICT AND HE'S VERY ANXIOUS TO WIN HIS VOTE WHY DON'T YOU SEE DAN THEN
WHO'S IT FROM KENNETH AHA
I'M ONE OF HIS CONFIDENTIAL MEN
SO ONE MORNING HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY TO PAY THE PLACE A PRELIMINARY VISIT
A DELIBERATE CRIMINAL I ADMIT THAT
YOU MUSTN'T THINK THAT EVERY PRETTY GIRL WITH DARK EYES YOU MEET IS LUCY ROGERS YOU KNOW
MARSHALL GOT EM FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THEY'LL BE SET TO WORK TODAY SO EVERYTHING WILL SEEM REG'LAR WHERE DO THEY SLEEP AND EAT INQUIRED THE DOCTOR
IF THEY WERE NOT FRIENDS HE ARGUED WITH THEM UNTIL THEY WERE FOR HE WAS AN HONEST LITTLE MAN IN HIS WAY AND TRIED TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH
THIS CAMPAIGN OUGHT TO BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER FOR I MEAN TO GET THEM TO HELP ME YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM I'M AFRAID NOT ALL OF THEM
AND WHILE HIS ACQUAINTANCES HAD AN INDEFINITE FEAR OF DEALING WITH HIM THEY COULD NOT ACCUSE HIM OPENLY
MY CRIME IS SO SERIOUS THAT THE CIRCUIT JUDGE HAS TO SIT ON THE CASE DO YOU KNOW WHERE LUCY IS SHE'S AT HOME I SUPPOSE
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN DOC
ABOUT SIXTY-SIX HE REPEATED VACANTLY TRYING TO DECIDE IF THIS WAS ANOTHER CHANCE SHOT
USUALLY THE VICTIM IS ABSOLUTELY TRANSFORMED AND BECOMES THE VERY OPPOSITE IN MANY WAYS OF THE NORMAL PERSONALITY
THERE WAS A SUBTLE MAGNETISM ABOUT THE GIRL'S LAUGHING FRECKLED FACE AND DANCING BLUE EYES THAT COULD NOT WELL BE RESISTED
AND THEN HE CUT HIS HORSE SO FIERCELY WITH THE WHIP THAT THE POOR BEAST GAVE A NEIGH OF TERROR AND STARTED DOWN THE ROAD AT A GALLOP
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT NO SAID HOPKINS
FRANK AN OUTRIGHT SAYS NELL
THERE'S TIME FOR ME TO CATCH THE EARLY TRAIN THE END END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S AUNT JANE'S NIECES AT WORK BY EDITH VAN DYNE
SO THE PRIMARIES WERE HELD AND KENNETH ATTENDED AND MADE A SPEECH AND WAS WARMLY APPLAUDED
HIS PEOPLE ARE GOOD CUSTOMERS
ISN'T IT A SHAME TO THINK THAT MODERN POLITICS HAS DESCENDED TO SUCH A LEVEL IN OUR FREE AND ENLIGHTENED REPUBLIC KENNETH NODDED STIRRING HIS COFFEE THOUGHTFULLY
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEND FOR HER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR IT WOULD MAKE HER SUSPICIOUS HE SAID
AT DUSK THE PARTY ARRIVED FROM FAIRVIEW IN THE AUTOMOBILES THE GIRLS GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE MEETING
FOLKS'LL BE EXPECTING ME
MR WATSON AT FIRST AN AMUSED OBSERVER OF THE CAMPAIGN SOON BECAME INDIGNANT AT THE WAY THAT KENNETH WAS RIDICULED AND REVILED
WILL YOU PLEASE FIND SEATS
SHE WAS A LITTLE WITHERED OLD WOMAN BUT WITH A PLEASANT FACE AND SHREWD BUT KINDLY EYES
IT IS VERY SIMPLE AND NATURAL PERSISTED BETH
I CANNOT REMEMBER A PERSON I KNEW OR ASSOCIATED WITH YET THINGS OUTSIDE OF MY PERSONAL LIFE SEEM TO HAVE CLUNG TO ME
I DON'T LIKE THE THINGS
BUT THESE INFERNAL CITY GIRLS CAME DOWN HERE AND STIRRED UP ALL THE TROUBLE YOU MADE A MISTAKE PUSHING THAT SIGN ISSUE
AND I'M NOT ANXIOUS TO POSE AS YOUR LOST LUCY
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T INTEREST ME HE REPLIED
I WANT TO INTERVIEW MRS HOPKINS FIRST TONIGHT ASKED TOM EAGERLY
THIS WAS WHAT MUST BE PREVENTED
SO WHEN KENNETH ROSE THEY PREPARED TO LISTEN IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE
WHAT ELSE DOES THE IDIOT SAY THAT HE'S LONELY AND DISCOURAGED AND HAD TO POUR OUT HIS HEART TO SOME ONE OR GO WILD SAID PATSY THE TEARS OF SYMPATHY FILLING HER EYES
AND NOW HE'S IN HE FINDS HE'S DOOMED TO DEFEAT
WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO WORK AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE SHALL BE DONE TO TRACE YOUR DAUGHTER
THEY PERMIT THEIR BUILDINGS WHICH FACE THE ROADS TO BE COVERED WITH BIG ADVERTISEMENTS AND THE FENCES ARE DECORATED IN THE SAME WAY
I DID NOT KNOW YOU KNEW ELIZA'S FAMILY MR BURKE YES SHE IS ONE OF MY RELATIVES AND CAME FROM ROANOKE VIRGINIA
THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT
PAY IT KEN SHE WHISPERED
DO YOU CARE FOR THEM I DON'T KNOW SAXE VERY WELL SHE ANSWERED OBSERVING THAT THEY WERE APPROACHING A PLACE WHERE ELIZA WAS BENDING OVER A ROSE-BUSH
AND IN FACE AND FORM YOU'RE THE IMAGE OF MY LUCY
IT WAS AT THEIR OWN REQUEST THAT HE REFRAINED FROM ANY ACTIVE WORK HIMSELF MERELY APPEARING AT THE MEETINGS THEY PLANNED WHERE HE MADE HIS SPEECHES AND IMPRESSED HIS HEARERS WITH HIS EARNESTNESS
THE GARDENS AND GROUNDS WERE GAILY DECORATED WITH CHINESE AND JAPANESE LANTERNS STREAMERS AND FORBES BANNERS
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ALL THIS HE ASKED
WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT
HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE
IT IS QUITE LIKELY TO BE TRUE
JUST ONE O THEM THAT GIVES IN TO TEMPTATION AND IS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO GET CAUGHT
WHEN EVENING CAME THE LETTERS HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED WHEN VIEWED CLOSELY
SO FAR THERE ISN'T A CLEW TO FOLLOW
WITH A FULL RECOLLECTION OF HIS WICKED SCHEMES IN HIS MIND HE HAD FEARED SOME MORE IMPORTANT ATTACK THAN THIS
IN MY POCKET SAID MR HOPKINS
AS KENNETH AND HIS SUPPORTERS APPROACHED THE OPERA HOUSE THEY HEARD LOUD CHEERING AND FROM A BAND-WAGON COVERED WITH BUNTING AND BANNERS IN WHICH HE HAD DRIVEN TO THE MEETING DESCENDED THE HONORABLE ERASTUS
WHERE HAVE YOU SEARCHED EVERYWHERE SIR THAT SHE MIGHT BE LIKELY TO GO
THEN I MET A YOUNG MAN HERE--HE SAYS HIS NAME IS TOM GATES--WHO CALLED ME HIS DEAR LUCY AND SAID I USED TO LOVE HIM
MY NAME'S HOPKINS
FOR THIS MATTER IS VERY SERIOUS INDEED
SO AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER THE NEXT MORNING BETH AND KENNETH TOOK ONE OF THE AUTOMOBILES THE BOY CONSENTING UNWILLINGLY TO THIS SORT OF LOCOMOTION BECAUSE IT WOULD SAVE MUCH TIME
ANYONE WOULD DO THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S UP ARCHIE AN INVASION OF GIRLS MOSTLY
BUT THE FACT IS THAT I FORGED THE CHECK AND GOT THE MONEY AND I'M WILLING TO STAND THE CONSEQUENCES WHY DID YOU DO IT ASKED BETH
WE HAD THE BETTER CANDIDATE YOU SEE AND THE BEST CAMPAIGN MANAGERS ADDED UNCLE JOHN WITH A PROUD SMILE
THEN AN ASSESSOR AND FINALLY HE RAN LAST TERM FOR STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS DISTRICT AND WAS ELECTED BY A MIGHTY SMALL MAJORITY WHY SMALL ASKED KENNETH
IT WAS A MIGHTY GOOD THING FOR THE FARMERS TO BE REMINDED BY MEANS OF THE SIGNS ON THEIR BARNS AND FENCES OF THE THINGS THEY NEEDED IN DAILY LIFE
KENNETH WAS LEFT THE MASTER OF ELMHURST AND POSSESSOR OF CONSIDERABLE WEALTH BESIDES AND AT FIRST HE COULD SCARCELY REALIZE HIS GOOD FORTUNE OR DECIDE HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
MY NAME'S PARSONS
HE MUST ACCEPT HIS DEFEAT LIKE A MAN AND SOME TIME TRY AGAIN
SO ALL WERE EAGER TO ATTEND AND ENJOY THE NOVEL EVENT
YES I AM MRS ROGERS SAID THE SWEET SAD VOICE
NOT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING AND WHEN SHE DOES I HOPE FOR A COMPLETE RESTORATION OF HER MEMORY BETH WENT WITH DR HOYT TO THE ROGERS FARM BECAUSE SHE KNEW MRS ROGERS
LIKE ENOUGH YE'LL HEV TO PAY BACK THE MONEY THE SOAP AN MEDICINE MEN GUV TH PAINTER TOO HE HAZARDED
IN THE FIRST PLACE MR HOPKINS WAS AGGRESSIVE AND KNEW POLITICAL METHODS THOROUGHLY
PLEASE WIRE FOR THE SPECIALIST AT ONCE SAID UNCLE JOHN
OH YOU DON'T FEAR THAT DO YOU MRS ROGERS ASKED BETH QUICKLY
BUT THAT WILL DO NO HARM AND SO IT WENT ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY
WHEN I HEARD THAT THREE GIRLS WERE ELECTIONEERING FOR FORBES I JUST LAUGHED
SHE WORE A WHITE COLLAR BUT THAT IS ALL WE CAN BE CERTAIN SHE HAD ON
IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MR WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
THAT'S WHAT I DID BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD
HE WAS REALLY AN EXCELLENT SPEAKER AND HIS YOUTH AND ENTHUSIASM COUNTED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR
AND I'M GLAD I DID YOU HAVE MADE HER STILL MORE UNHAPPY SAID BETH GENTLY
DRIVE FOR YOUR LIFE SHE CRIED
A WOMAN WAS WORKING IN THE KITCHEN AND I LAUGHED JOYFULLY AND WISHED HER A GOOD MORNING
PAUSING IN FRONT OF THE PICTURESQUE TABLE ROCK THAT HE HAD COME TO INSPECT THE BOY UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF CHAGRIN AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AT THIS TIME MR WATSON RENDERED HIS ACCOUNTS AND TURNED OVER THE ESTATE TO ITS OWNER
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED AND A KNOCK CAME UPON THE DOOR
THEN HE NODDED WITH SATISFACTION
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY SECRETARY ME MR FORBES--ME YES TOM
YES OF THE CARSON ADVERTISING SIGN COMPANY YES WELL I'VE GOT A BIG JOB FOR YOU
WHY THERE ISN'T A PAPER IN THE DISTRICT THAT'S SUPPORTING FORBES THIS YEAR YOU'VE A WRONG IDEA OF THE CAMPAIGN MR BRIGGS SAID UNCLE JOHN
WILL YOU HELP ME TO GET AWAY TO ESCAPE TO SOME PLACE WHERE NO ONE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO TRACE ME DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY THEN I AM SURE OF IT
WHAT RIGHT HAVE THESE GIRLS TO INTERFERE IN A GAME LIKE THIS OH SHUT UP RAST THOMPSON
MOREOVER THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WAS DUBBED CLOSE-FISTED BY HIS NEIGHBORS
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO PREVENT RURAL ADVERTISING HE REMARKED YOU'LL FIND YOUR HANDS FULL KENNETH LOOKED UP SMILING
SHE ADMITTED DR HOYT MR BURKE AND TWO SERVANTS
VOTE FOR FORBES--THE PEOPLE'S CHAMPION WHO IN THUNDER COULD A DONE THAT MURMURED MR HOPKINS STARING OPEN-MOUTHED AT THE GREAT BANNERS
HE DROVE HER OVER TO ELMHURST THAT MORNING AND HE DRIVES OVER TWO OR THREE EVENINGS A WEEK TO MEET HER ON THE SLY AND GET HER REPORT
THE OTHER IS TO PERMIT THE GIRL TO GO AWAY AS SHE SUGGESTS
PATSY THE DELEGATED LEADER LOOKED GRAVELY AT THE BOY AND ASKED
I'M WILLIN WAS THE RESPONSE
DON YOU WORRY ANY MORE
HE SAID HE WAS GLAD HE DID IT AN DIDN'T MIND SERVIN A SENTENCE IN PRISON
THEY BELIEVED THAT KENNETH WOULD PROVE A GOOD REPRESENTATIVE AND CARRY OUT HIS PROMISES TO THE VOTERS
THIS SIMPLE INCIDENT CHEERED KENNETH MORE THAN YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE AND HE WAS ACTUALLY WHISTLING AS HE RODE THROUGH THE GLEN WHERE THE COUNTRY ROAD WOUND ITS WAY BESIDE THE NOISY RUSHING STREAM
BOUT TIME YOU WAS GETTING BACK OLD MAN
WELL STICK IT OUT OLD MAN
BUT THERE WAS A MYSTERY ABOUT HER
JES MIDDLIN MISS WELL IS SHE STOUT OR THIN I SHOULD SAY SORTER BETWIXT AN BETWEEN MISS HOW OLD IS LUCY JES TURNED EIGHTEEN MISS NEVER MIND BETH INTERRUPTED THE BOY
IT'S WAITING FOR YOU HOPKINS--INTEREST AND ALL
CAN THIS BE ARRANGED NOW I'LL SEE SIR SHE FOUND MARTHA AND ASKED HER TO SEND ELIZA PARSONS FOR SOME ROSES AND CHRYSANTHEMUMS WHICH WERE IN A RETIRED PLACE SHUT IN BY EVERGREEN HEDGES
PUT THIS DRAFT FOR FIFTY THOUSAND TO MY CREDIT AS A STARTER AH I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
WHEN NOON CAME UNCLE JOHN HUNTED HER UP WHICH WAS NOT DIFFICULT IN ELMWOOD AND TOGETHER THEY WENT TO THE VILLAGE HOTEL TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT
AND YOU TWO DAYS SAID HE
I DON'T THINK SQUIERS HAS CASHED THE CHECK YET THE HONORABLE ERASTUS GAVE A ROAR LIKE A WILD BULL BUT UNCLE JOHN HAD WALKED QUIETLY OUT AND CLIMBED INTO HIS BUGGY
GOOD AFTERNOON MR HOPKINS AH IT'S FORBES ISN'T IT REPLIED HOPKINS SLIGHTINGLY
IT STRUCK HIM THIS MORNING THAT THEY HAD LITTLE CAUSE TO BE INTERESTED IN HIM
IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO VOTE THOSE MEN TOMORROW I SHALL ARREST YOU AS WELL AS MR HOPKINS AND DR SQUIERS THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS SIR BLUSTERED THE MANAGER
LOOK ON THIS PICTURE MY FRIENDS AND TELL ME WOULD YOU PREFER TO SEE THIS--OR THIS AT THE WORD EACH CHILD PULLED AWAY THE SIGN-PAINTED SLIP AND STOOD ARRAYED IN A PRETTY GOWN OF SPOTLESS WHITE
WHATEVER HE AGREES TO I WILL GUARANTEE TO THE FULL RESOURCES OF MY BANK THE EDITOR PRICKED UP HIS EARS AND DUSTED A CHAIR FOR HIS VISITOR WITH HIS APRON
THAT OLD WILL HAD NEVER BEEN A FITTING MATE FOR HIS WIFE COULD READILY BE UNDERSTOOD AND YET THE MAN WAS STILL DEVOTED TO HIS HELPLESS UNRESPONSIVE SPOUSE
TOM GATES HAD BEEN AT THE HOUSE TWO DAYS BEFORE HE ENCOUNTERED ELIZA PARSONS AT THE TABLE FOR THE SERVANTS WERE NOT ALL ABLE TO TAKE THEIR MEALS AT THE SAME TIME
NOW WE ARE QUITE ALONE AND CAN TALK AT OUR EASE
ONE OF HIS STUBBORN MOODS HAD SEIZED HIM
I NEED A SECRETARY AND IN THAT POSITION TOM GATES WILL QUICKLY BE ABLE TO LIVE DOWN THIS UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR
AND THAT ISN'T ALL WHAT'S THE REST MR WATSON YOU OWE SOMETHING TO YOURSELF LAD
NOW THEN THE ELECTION CAN GO TO BLAZES SAID KENNETH CHEERFULLY TO MR WATSON
MR FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS
HE ACCEPTED ME ON THAT CONDITION AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER WE WERE MARRIED SOME TIME THAT MY HUSBAND REALIZED HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD EVER BE TO AROUSE MY AFFECTION
MONDAY MORNIN TOM WAS ARRESTED OVER T THE MILL FER PASSIN A FORGED CHECK AN GETTIN SIXTY DOLLARS ON IT
WE DIDN'T ASK IT DONE BUT THEY JES DONE IT
THAT'S ALL
PATSY'S HAD A LETTER FROM THE BOY HERSELF OH DID YOU INQUIRED LOUISE
TEN DAYS AGO SAID KENNETH
BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
BUT YOU MUSN'T TAKE IT ALTOGETHER AS A JOKE
AND HE'S GOT FOOL NOTIONS TOO
I CAN'T ATTEND TO YOU NOW I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU SIR REPLIED THE DETECTIVE BUT MY BUSINESS WON'T WAIT UNTIL WEDNESDAY WHAT IS IT ABOUT SIR ABOUT THE ELECTION THEN I WON'T BE BOTHERED
SURE-LY
IT'S A GOOD ARRANGEMENT AND I'M GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED ELMHURST WHEN THEY MET THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS DRIVING ALONG THE ROAD
HE FORBADE ME TO EVER COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AGAIN
THERE WAS NO SUSPICION ON HER PART
I WATCHED EM AN NELL SAYS IF WE ON'Y HAD TH MONEY THET WAS WASTED ON THET PAINT AN LABOR WE MIGHT FIND OUR LUCY
FROM WHERE THEY WERE SEATED IN FULL VIEW OF THE VAST AUDIENCE THE GIRLS APPEARED AS A MASS OF ADVERTISING SIGNS AND THE BANNER ABOVE THEM INDICATED QUITE PLAINLY THAT THESE WERE THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES MR HOPKINS AS HE OBSERVED THIS SCENE SMILED WITH SATISFACTION
THE BOY WAS ASTONISHED
MARTHA SAID KENNETH DID YOU EMPLOY THE NEW LINEN MAID ELIZA PARSONS YES SIR SHE REPLIED APPARENTLY SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE WE'RE GOING TO TRY IT ANYHOW WAS THE PROMPT DECISION
SO WE GAVE THEM AN OBJECT LESSON
POLITICS IS A GAME DECLARED MR MERRICK
DON'T SPEAK OF IT AGAIN GIRLS
WILL YOU EXCUSE MY ANSWERING THAT QUESTION SHE ASKED
MARTHA REFLECTED
PLEASE DO NOT MENTION THIS INTERVIEW TO HER AT PRESENT MISS PHIBBS SAID THE DETECTIVE
DO YOU WANT ME TO MIX IN THESE PETTY POLITICS ASKED THE BOY IRRITABLY
NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MRS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH
YOU SEE THOMPSON ISN'T A VERY SUCCESSFUL MERCHANT
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SHE INQUIRED WITH A SNIFF OF DISDAIN
THE ELECTION DOESN'T INTEREST ME SAID MR MARSHALL TURNING AWAY
LOUISE WENT TO HER ROOM DONNED A WRAPPER AND BANDAGED HER HEAD
THESE BOOTHS WERE DECORATED WITH FORBES BANNERS AND ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF COMMENT AS THE IDEA WAS A DISTINCT INNOVATION IN THIS DISTRICT
IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE
WE SEEM TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO UNRAVEL AN INTERESTING MYSTERY AND WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH TO THE END VERY GOOD SIR SAID MR BURKE AND LEFT THEM WITH A BRIEF NOD OF FAREWELL
I MUST SEE BRIGGS MUTTERED THE HONORABLE ERASTUS
AND THEIR OWN VOTES COUNT TOO I'LL RUN OVER TO THE BANK SAID UNCLE JOHN AND GET ACQUAINTED THERE SO HE TIED THE HORSES TO A POST AND LET PATSY PROCEED ALONE UPON HER MISSION WHILE HE WANDERED OVER TO A LITTLE BRICK BUILDING OF NEAT APPEARANCE WHICH BORE THE INSCRIPTION BANK IN GOLD LETTERS ON ITS PLATE-GLASS WINDOW
THE CONTRACTING SIGN PAINTERS WERE MERELY IN THE BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY
HIS HEAD WAS BALD HIS HANDS FAT AND RED AND HIS FEET ENORMOUS
THERE'S A GIRL IN THE HOUSE SIR ONE OF THE MAIDS WHO IS THE LIVING IMAGE OF LUCY ROGERS YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY HER SUGGESTED THE DETECTIVE HIS GAZE STILL OUT OF THE WINDOW
HE DESERVES TO BE DEFEATED AND HE WILL BE THE MANAGER WAS THOUGHTFUL
IT WASN'T A DESPERATE CONDITION BY ANY MEANS WITH POOR TOM IN PRISON FOR YEARS--AND JUST FOR TRYING TO HELP HER TOM ISN'T IN PRISON YOU KNOW ANY MORE SAID BETH QUIETLY
WILLINGLY SIR I WISH TO SEND THE GIRL INTO A DEEP SLEEP TO RENDER HER UNCONSCIOUS WITHOUT HER SUSPECTING MY INTENTION OR REALIZING THE FACT
I KNOW
IS HE SINGULAR IN THIS BY NO MEANS
YOUNG FORBES WAS HIS MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMER AND HE RESPECTED HIM HIGHLY
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK FOR WE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN GETTING DEMORALIZED
BUT I'M GOIN TO TELL YOU
BUT UNCLE JOHN MET HIS GAZE WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE AND CONTINUED
I KNOW WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS BAD
ONE DAY SHE STOLE A DI'MOND RING OFF'N OLD MISS SQUIERS AND DUG OUT AND I TOLD NANCY THEN--NANCY'S YOUNG MISS SQUIERS--THAT I'D ALWAYS HAD MY SUSPICIONS OF THE HUSSY
I HAVE ALREADY CALLED YOUR ATTENTION IN MY CIRCULARS RESUMED THE SPEAKER TO THE FACT THAT ADVERTISING SIGNS ARE THE SOURCE OF LARGE INCOME TO THE FARMERS OF THIS DISTRICT
I WANT TO GET A CIRCULAR LETTER TO EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT ALL RIGHT SAID BETH
ALL THIS WAS SOON REALIZED AT ELMHURST AND HAD THE EFFECT OF PLUNGING THE YOUTHFUL ASPIRANT FOR POLITICAL HONORS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR
SHE'LL WORRY ABOUT ME I KNOW
THESE THINGS ARE DONE EVERY DAY AND NO ONE'S THE WISER FOR IT
BUT LUCKILY YE'LL BE NO PRESIDENT--UNLESS IT'S OF A WOMAN'S CLUB THERE'S THE BELL CRIED PATSY
I CAN'T SELL MY VOTE MISS CAUSE I'VE BEEN PLANNIN T'VOTE FER MR FORBES ANYHOW
BUT YE SEE THEY'RE CONTRACTED
IF THE THING WAS DISCOVERED IT WOULD MEAN PRISON FOR BOTH OF US FIDDLESTICKS CRIED THE IRASCIBLE HOPKINS
I'D LIKE TO STUDY HER A LITTLE IT WAS ABSURD TO CONNECT HER WITH LUCY ROGERS OBSERVED KENNETH FOR THERE IS NOTHING IN HER CHARACTER TO REMIND ONE OF THE UNHAPPY GIRL EXCEPT HER LOOKS ADDED BETH
WHAT RIGHT HAS ANY SOAP MAKER TO FLAUNT HIS WARES IN MY FACE WHETHER I'M INTERESTED IN THEM OR NOT THE RIGHT OF CUSTOM
SHE WAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS ELECTED KEN'S EYES FILLED
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MAJOR DOYLE WAS PREJUDICED
THE BOOKS ARE IN YOUR HANDS
YOU CAN'T WIN A POLITICAL ELECTION WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY DECLARED PATSY WISELY
THE HON
IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
SO THIS BOY WAS DOUBLY FOOLISH IN RUINING HIMSELF TO GET SIXTY DOLLARS TO PAY AN UNJUST DEMAND HE WAS SOFT-HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH
WE ARE ALL ALIKE INTERESTED IN LUCY ROGERS MR BURKE SAID THE BOY
THE ONLY OTHER PERSON PRESENT WAS OLD DONALD THE COACHMAN WHO WAS RATHER DEAF AND NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CHATTER AROUND HIM
HER FATHER NEVER WOULD BE SERIOUS WHERE KENNETH WAS CONCERNED
I HOPED YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST ME ON THE LAWN
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT FOR PAINTING SIGNS TAKES THAT MUCH AWAY FROM YOUR NEWSPAPERS WHY PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT MR MERRICK
WHY SHOULD YOU PAINT ADVERTISING SIGNS UPON YOUR BARNS ANY MORE THAN UPON YOUR HOUSES
HE HAD KNOWN UNCLE JOHN WHEN THE MILLIONAIRE VISITED ELMHURST TWO YEARS BEFORE AND SINCE THEN HAD LEARNED MORE PARTICULARS CONCERNING HIM
BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
OH DO AS YOU LIKE MY BOY
HAVE YOU SPOKEN MUCH WITH ELIZA NOT AT ALL I THINK
IT WILL COST SOMETHING ON OUR SIDE TO RUN THIS CAMPAIGN IN A WAY TO WIN THE YOUNG MAN FROWNED
HOPKINS REALIZED THAT MERRICK HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST SUSPICION OF THIS PLOT
YOU MUST KNOW ME
SHE'S BLIND HER HUSBAND DIDN'T TELL US THAT SAID THE GIRL
THEREFORE CONTINUED MR MERRICK I PROPOSE THAT I UNDERTAKE ANY FURTHER EXPENSE THAT MAY BE INCURRED SO AS TO DIVIDE THE BURDEN THAT'S BETTER DECLARED PATSY
SO HE HAD GOT HIRED AT THE MILL AN HAD A LIKELY JOB AN WAS DOIN WELL
OF COURSE MR MERRICK COULDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY THIS CHANCE SHOT SO HE MUST BE THROWN OFF THE SCENT
THIS FIGHT HAS COST ME A PRETTY PENNY ALREADY I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY GROWLED SQUIERS
IT WAS AT LUNCHEON THE DAY OF THE JOINT DEBATE AT FAIRVIEW THAT THE YOUNG MAN FIRST MET ELIZA WHO SAT OPPOSITE HIM
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WE CAN'T GIVE THEM PROPER ATTENTION ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN WHO COULD GO TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH ENOUGH INFLUENCE TO WIN THE VOTES TO CARRY SUCH A UNIQUE MEASURE THROUGH AND WHO IS THAT SIR KENNETH FORBES THE OWNER OF ELMHURST AND THE LARGEST TAXPAYER IN THE COUNTY ME SIR YOU'RE THE MAN A STATE REPRESENTATIVE IT'S AN HONORABLE OFFICE
WE START AGAIN BRIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING CHAPTER VIII THE HONORABLE ERASTUS IS ASTONISHED THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS HAD BEEN ABSENT AT THE STATE CAPITAL FOR SEVERAL DAYS LOOKING AFTER VARIOUS MATTERS OF BUSINESS
SO FAR AS I KNEW I HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE PLACE BEFORE
BUT WE OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD SHOWING FOR YOUR COUSIN AND I'LL DO MY VERY BEST TO HELP YOU AS SHE RODE HOME WITH UNCLE JOHN IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER A DAY OF REALLY HARD WORK PATSY SIZED UP THE SITUATION AND DECLARED THAT SHE WAS SATISFIED THAT SHE HAD MADE PROGRESS
BY CRICKEY I WON'T STAND THIS FROM YOU
AREN'T WE GIRLS WE ARE ALL RIGHT SAID MR MERRICK
I MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN SHE ADDED WITH A SIGH
MRS ROGERS ROSE QUIETLY AND WALKED TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY LOST LUCY HE SAID WITH A GLANCE AT THE UNCONSCIOUS DONALD
SHALL WE SEE YOU TOMORROW JUST AS SOON AS I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE A HORSE OR AN AUTOMOBILE YOUR MAN MAY DRIVE ME TO THE TOWN SIR IF IT IS CONVENIENT KENNETH GAVE THE REQUIRED ORDER AND THEN MR BURKE ASKED
THEREFORE THOMPSON DARED NOT MAKE A FIGHT AND ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICAN VOTE WAS NORMALLY THE LARGEST IN THE DISTRICT HOPKINS HAD MANAGED TO WIN ENOUGH OF THEM TO HIS SIDE TO WIN
I DO NOT THINK WE CAN WIN HE SAID AS SHE LEFT HIM
SHE LIVED ON A FARM FIVE MILES FROM HERE AND SHE WAS MY SWEETHEART
IT'S SO GOOD OF YOU KEN TO TAKE TOM GATES INTO YOUR EMPLOY SAID THE GIRL PRESSING HER COUSIN'S ARM
HE ARRIVED AT HILLDALE ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN AND WENT TO HIS HOUSE FOR BREAKFAST
VERY WELL I'LL CALL WEDNESDAY SIR AT THE JAIL MARSHALL GAVE HIM A QUICK LOOK
IF I THOUGHT--IF I BELIEVED I COULD FILL THE POSITION WITH CREDIT--I MIGHT UNDERTAKE IT I'LL ANSWER FOR THAT RETORTED THE OLD MAN HIGHLY PLEASED WITH HIS EASY VICTORY
I'LL TELEPHONE YOU THAT BAD MAN D BETTER LOOK OUT CHUCKLED THE MAJOR
GUESS I'LL BE GOIN MISS HE ROSE SLOWLY FROM HIS SEAT BUT THE GIRL DID NOT INTEND TO LOSE ANY OF THE FUN THIS QUEER INDIVIDUAL MIGHT YET FURNISH
THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MR HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER AND WITH SUDDEN DISMAY REALIZED THAT ELIZA WAS A SPY IN THE SERVICE OF THE ENEMY
WITHIN TWO DAYS EVERY FARMER HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT MR FORBES WOULD MEET MR HOPKINS AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT HE SAID WITH A SIGH
EVERY GOOD AMERICAN SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN POLITICS
TELL ME MY DEAR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR OLD LIFE HE ASKED
DID YOU SEE THAT YES
SUCH FRANKNESS WAS BOTH UNUSUAL AND REFRESHING
I'VE TALKED WITH LATHAM
I'M AFRAID OF LUCY WHY DEAR I CANNOT TELL
THAT IS STRANGE THE GIRL STARED AT HIM HALF FRIGHTENED AND DREW HER HAND OVER HER EYES WITH A GESTURE OF BEWILDERMENT
HE WAS DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH ME AND AT THIS PERIOD WHEN I SEEMED COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM MY OLD LIFE AND THE FUTURE CONTAINED NO PROMISE I THOUGHT IT BEST TO WEAR OUT THE REMAINDER OF MY EXISTENCE IN THE SECLUSION OF A FARM-HOUSE
THE REPRESENTATIVE HAD PROMPTLY TELEPHONED TO MARSHALL AT FAIRVIEW TELLING HIM NOT TO VOTE THE MEN AS ARRANGED
THESE SIGNS WERE NOT WORKS OF ART BUT THEY WERE DISTINCTLY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS AND ONLY A FOOL IN THE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WOULD PROTEST AGAINST THE INEVITABLE
GO HOME LOUISE AND PACK UP
DRIVE FOR HOME HE WHIPPED UP THE SPIRITED HORSE AND THEY DASHED AWAY
BUT SINCE HE HAD RISEN FROM A STABLE-BOY TO HIS PRESENT AFFLUENT POSITION HE HAD NEVER BEEN UNWISE OR CARELESS ENOUGH TO BE CAUGHT IN ANY CROOKED ACTION
BUT SHE LOOKED AROUND WILDLY AS IF ABOUT TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT WHEN LOUISE STEPPED FORWARD AND GENTLY TOOK ELIZA'S HAND IN HER OWN
KENNETH FELT KEENLY THE HUMILIATING EXPERIENCES HE HAD PASSED THROUGH AND HAD SUNK BACK INTO HIS OLD MOODY RESERVE
SHE WORKED FOR A DENTIST IN THE TOWN AND WAS ACCUSED OF STEALING A RING AND IT NEARLY BROKE HER HEART TO BE SO UNJUSTLY SUSPECTED
MR MERRICK WANTS TO SEE YOU ON BUSINESS CHARLEY SAID THE BANKER
WE DON'T VOTE IN KEN'S DISTRICT REMARKED THE MAJOR OR THERE WOULD BE SIX VOTES TO HIS CREDIT AND THAT WOULD BEAT MY OWN RECORD BY FOUR KEN IS SO IMPRESSIONABLE THAT I'M AFRAID THIS DEFEAT WILL RUIN HIS LIFE SAID BETH SOFTLY
WHO DARES INTERFERE WITH THESE LIBERTIES WHO DARES INTRUDE UNINVITED INTO THEIR PREMISES AND PAINT OUT THE SIGNS THEY HAVE PERMITTED TO OCCUPY THEIR FENCES AND BARNS AND SHEDS
HE TALKED WITH THE MAN AT LENGTH AND TALKED WITH THE CONVINCING EFFECT THAT THE MENTION OF MONEY HAS
BUT THOSE WHO KNEW THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL INTIMATELY COULD READ MUCH TO ADMIRE IN THE DEPTH OF HER GREAT DARK EYES AND SHE WAS NOT THE LEAST INTERESTING OF THE THREE NIECES WHOSE FORTUNES HAD BEEN SO GREATLY INFLUENCED BY AUNT JANE AND UNCLE JOHN MERRICK
KENNETH HAD LITTLE CHANCE TO TEST HIS SECRETARY'S ABILITIES JUST THEN BECAUSE THE GIRLS POUNCED UPON THE NEW RECRUIT AND USED HIS SERVICES IN A VARIETY OF WAYS
I DO INDEED TRY TO LIVE AN UPRIGHT LIFE I GUESS SO MR HOPKINS I GUESS SO
YOU MR FORBES YES
THEN SHE TOOK SICK AN NELL AN I NURSED HER AS CAREFUL AS WE COULD
KENNETH FLUSHED RED AS HE HELD THE RECEIVER TO HIS EAR AND THEN GREW WHITE
ON MY WORD IT IS IT'S TOO LITTLE COME TO THINK OF IT
YOU ARE VERY WELCOME
WE'RE NOT ALL FOOLS I GUESS RAST REMARKED MARY HOPKINS LOOKING AT HER DAMAGED AND IRRITABLE HUSBAND WITH A BLENDING OF CURIOSITY AND CONTEMPT THAT YOU'RE BOUT AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE YOU WAIT SAID ERASTUS GRIMLY
I'VE COME TO SEE YOUR HUSBAND ON BUSINESS SHE SNIFFED AT THAT BUT PICKED UP HER DARNING AND RELAPSED INTO SILENCE
THE GIRL IS PERFECTLY SANE BUT SHE HAS SUFFERED A STRANGE LAPSE OF MEMORY
HIS MOTHER ONCE KEPT A STATIONERY SHOP IN TOWN AND HE WAS STABLE BOY AT THE HOTEL
IT WAS MY DESIRE THAT THE VOTERS SHOULD FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN
WHAT'S HE IN FOR FOR--FOR--LET'S SEE
AND WHATEVER THE YOUNG MAN UNDERTOOK HE ACCOMPLISHED IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER
MARSHALL'S GOT A COMMISSARY DEPARTMENT AND FEEDS EM REGULAR RATIONS LIKE SO MANY SOLDIERS
THESE CASES ARE NOT SO RARE AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE HE SAID
THOMPSON OWED HOPKINS A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND HOPKINS HELD A MORTGAGE ON THE STOCK
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS OLD LUCY
SHE TRIED TO FIND A CAVITY IN THE TOOTH BUT IT SEEMED PERFECTLY SOUND
BUT IT IS NOT A FLAT COUNTRY AND NATURE HAS GIVEN IT MANY PRETTY WOODLAND GLADES AND ROCKY GLENS TO ADD TO ITS CHARM
BUT IN WHAT WAY IS MR FORBES THE BEST MAN HE'S HONEST
UNCLE JOHN HAD CARRIED HIS NIECES TO A FARM AT MILLVILLE IN THE ADIRONDACK REGION FOR THE SUMMER SO THAT KENNETH HEARD BUT SELDOM FROM HIS FRIENDS
SHE'D SICH HIGH SPERRITS ONCT WHERE'S THE BOY TOM ASKED KENNETH SOMEWHAT GRUFFLY
I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS
PATSY DECIDED SHE WOULD SHOP AT EACH AND EVERY STORE IN THE PLACE AND ENGAGE THE STORE-KEEPERS IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ELECTION
THANK YOU HE SAID
THIS PROTECTIVE CLAUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN CASE OF FIRE ALTERATION OR REMOVAL OF BUILDINGS OR DESTRUCTION OF FENCES AND SIGN-BOARDS BY WEATHER OR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OWNERS
BUT I'VE SAVED LUCY FROM ANY DISGRACE AND SHE'S YOUNG
YOUNG GATES WAS STANDING WITH HIS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD ELIZA PARSONS WHO A FEW PACES AWAY HAD HER BACK TO THE DOOR OF HER OWN CHAMBER FROM WHICH SHE HAD EVIDENTLY JUST STEPPED
HE'S WORKED HARD ENOUGH ANYHOW HAS HE YES
YOU MAY AS WELL UNDERSTAND SIR THAT I STAND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE AND HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH YOUR SIDE THAT DOESN'T INTEREST ME ESPECIALLY SIR ANSWERED KENNETH SMILING
BUT PATRICIA DOYLE--USUALLY CALLED PATSY BY HER FRIENDS--WAS AFTER ALL THE GENERAL FAVORITE WITH STRANGERS AND FRIENDS ALIKE
YOU SEE HER MOTHER IS BLIND AND OLD WILL DOESN'T OBSERVE VERY CLOSELY DOES LUCY RESEMBLE HER MOTHER INQUIRED BETH
SHE'S IN HER OWN ROOM THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED
FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE CERTAIN EDIBLES SUCH AS CHARLOTTE-RUSSE SPANISH CREAM WINE JELLIES AND MOUSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CAVIARS AND ANCHOVIES WERE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO THEM
ONCE THEY ARE BROUGHT TO A PROPER WAY OF THINKING THEY WILL SUPPORT KENNETH LOYALLY THEN WE MUST BRING THEM TO A PROPER WAY OF THINKING SAID PATSY WITH DECISION
HAVE YOU COME TO SEE ME ABOUT THE ELECTION IT'S--IT'S SUMP'N BOUT THE LECTION AN THEN AGIN IT AIN'T
DON'T TALK TO ME
THERE ARE SEVEN IMPORTANT PAPERS IN OUR DISTRICT AND FIVE OF THEM ARE REPUBLICAN
THE ONLY DENTIST AT ELMWOOD WAS DR SQUIERS SO THE GIRL RAN UP THE FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO HIS OFFICE WHICH WAS LOCATED OVER THE HARDWARE STORE
I REPRESENT THE FORBES INTERESTS SAID THE DETECTIVE SEATING HIMSELF IN THE PRIVATE OFFICE AND IT HAS COME TO OUR NOTICE THAT DR SQUIERS HAS PERMITTED SIXTY-SIX FRAUDULENT REGISTRATIONS TO BE ENTERED ON THE BOOKS
I LOVED TO TALK AND LAUGH
IT'S BUSINESS
AFTERNOON MISS HE SAID IN A HESITATING VOICE
THOMPSON THE PROPRIETOR WAS A SOUR-VISAGED MAN TALL AND LANKY AND EVIDENTLY A DYSPEPTIC
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE DISPOSING RATHER FREELY OF MY HORSES AND CARTS YES KEN
BUT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HAD NO INTENTION OF TAKING CHANCES OR MONKEYING WITH FATE AS HE TERSELY EXPRESSED IT
IS THIS MR SMITH ASKED HOPKINS
AFTER EXPRESSING HER SYMPATHY SHE ASKED WHAT SHE COULD DO
BUT WHEN KENNETH RODE TO THE MOUTH OF THE GLEN ON HIS WAY HOME AND PAUSED TO LOOK BACK HE COULD SEE THE INJUNCTION TAKE SMITH'S LIVER PILLS STARING AT HIM IN GRIM DEFIANCE OF THE SCRUBBING BRUSHES
O COURSE REPLIED THE MAN WITH A GRIN OF AMUSEMENT
PERHAPS DR SQUIERS WAS THINKING
SO SHE GREETED THE GIRL CORDIALLY AND SAID
HE TOL HER IT WAS TRUE HE FORGED TH CHECK BUT HE DID IT TO SAVE HER
THIS DEAL IS GOING TO WIN
HE HAD IMAGINED THAT THE FORBES PARTY WOULD IGNORE IT AND LEAVE HIM THE PRESTIGE OF CROWING OVER HIS OPPONENT'S TIMIDITY
A SPEAKERS STAND PROFUSELY DECORATED HAD BEEN ERECTED ON THE LAWN AND HUNDREDS OF FOLDING CHAIRS PROVIDED FOR SEATS
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
I DID IT
HE WALKED AWAY WHISTLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AND DECIDED THAT HE WOULD GO OVER TO THE LIVERY STABLE GET A HORSE AND BUGGY DRIVE OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND SPEND THE DAY TALKING WITH THE FARMERS
BOYS HE SAID I TOLD YOU ALL A WEEK OR SO AGO I'D LIKE YOU TO VOTE FOR HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE AS I BELIEVED HIS ELECTION WOULD RESULT IN MORE WORK FOR THE MILL AND BETTER WAGES FOR THE EMPLOYEES
LUCY QUICKLY SHE SPRANG OUT INTO THE HALL AND TURNED THE CORNER IN TIME TO SEE A STRANGE TABLEAU
YOU MUST KNOW HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO YOU AS BETH AND KENNETH DROVE BACK TO ELMHURST THEY WERE BOTH RATHER SILENT FOR THEY HAD BEEN STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE SCENE AT THE FARM-HOUSE
FOR HIS FACE WAS DRAWN WITH CARE AND ANXIETY EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS FORMER NEAT APPEARANCE WAS CHANGED TO ONE CARELESS AND UNTIDY
IT ISN'T A VERY NICE THING TO DO--LISTENING TO A PRIVATE CONVERSATION SAID THE GIRL BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED THEY WERE GOING TO PLAY SUCH A TRICK ON KENNETH I COULDN'T HELP EAVESDROPPING I THINK YOU WERE JUSTIFIED DECLARED MR WATSON WITH A GRAVE FACE
I DON MIND THE WALKING MUCH THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE WHILE OLD WILL ROGERS LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY AND THE GIRL AND THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
HE WAS A SMALL LEAN MAN OF UNASSUMING APPEARANCE WITH A THIN FACE AND GRAY EYES SET CLOSE TOGETHER
THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM
I HAVE DISLIKED THE MAN EVER SINCE HE TREATED US SO SHABBILY ON THE NIGHT OF THE MEETING NEVER MIND HIM
UNCLE JOHN HAD REMEMBERED THIS FACT AND IT HAD A PROMINENT PLACE IN HIS PLANS
WHAT CONCERN IS YOUR FIRM DOING ALL THIS PAINTING FOR A MAN NAMED MERRICK THEN THE FOREMAN DROVE AWAY AND MR HOPKINS WAS LEFT GREATLY PUZZLED
THEN SHE SUMMONED MARTHA AND ASKED THE HOUSEKEEPER TO SEND ELIZA PARSONS TO SIT WITH HER IN THE DARKENED ROOM AS SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM A HEADACHE
HE HAD BEEN SO INTERESTED IN HIS BUSINESS ENTERPRISES FOR MANY YEARS THAT HE HAD FAILED TO REALIZE HOW HIS FORTUNE WAS GROWING AND IT ASTOUNDED HIM TO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND FIND HIMSELF POSSESSED OF MANY MILLIONS
BUT IT IS NOT SURPRISING WHEN REDUCED TO THAT BASIS
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED A FRESH BOX OF BON-BONS FROM NEW YORK
THE FARMERS ALONG THE ROAD NODDED AT THE YOUNG FELLOW GOOD-NATUREDLY AS HE PASSED THEM
SO BOTH KENNETH AND MR WATSON WERE WITH THE DRAG AT THE STATION WHEN THE NOON TRAIN DREW IN
FINALLY HE REMARKED
I MUST HAVE HAD A PAST OF COURSE OR I SHOULDN'T BE A GROWN WOMAN NOW
BUT TO OFFSET THIS CHEERING CONDITION THE DEMOCRATIC AGENTS WHO MADE THE CANVASS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS AN AIR OF UNCERTAINTY THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT AND THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO DECLARED FOR HOPKINS WERE LUKEWARM AND FAINT-HEARTED AND MIGHT EASILY BE INDUCED TO CHANGE THEIR VOTES
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ROARED THE EXASPERATED HOPKINS
HERE IS ONE THING FOR YOU TO REMEMBER--THAT WE ARE ALWAYS TO BE TRUE FRIENDS FROM THIS TIME FORWARD
BUT HE MUST BE BROUGHT FROM BUFFALO
WE HAVE IN THIS DISTRICT TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED FARMERS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST REPORTS OF THE BUREAU OF STATISTICS AND DIVIDING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS BY TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED WE FIND THAT EACH FARMER RECEIVES AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY AND ONE-QUARTER CENTS PER YEAR FOR ALLOWING HIS FENCES AND BUILDINGS TO BE SMOTHERED IN LURID ADVERTISING SIGNS
SHE LAUGHED AND FLIRTED WITH HIM OUTRAGEOUS AND SAID SHE WAS A STRANGER IN THESE PARTS WHEN I'D SEEN HER MANY A TIME AT MISS SQUIERS'S WHAT WAS HER NAME THEN ASKED THE MAN
PATSY WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL
SO YOU MAY SPEAK FREELY
I'M--I'M SOMMUT BROKE UP AN DISCOURAGED AN AIN'T TH MAN I USED TO BE
THEY'RE PRETTY TOO AND THE MEN GIVE IN AT THE FIRST ATTACK
LOUISE NOW ROSE SOFTLY AND RANG HER BELL
I WAS SO SURE THAT I BEGGED HER TO LET ME SEE IF THERE WAS A SCAR ON HER LEFT ARM
BUT HOW'D YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THIS GIRL SHE INQUIRED WITH SUDDEN SUSPICION
ARE YOU SO SURE OF ELECTION INQUIRED BETH
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS BEING ROBBED BUT THE CO-OPERATION OF THE BIG CHICAGO FIRM WAS NECESSARY TO HIS PLANS
NOW HOWEVER WITH THE SPIRIT OF LONELINESS UPON HIM HE SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF A GLEN THAT WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING STUDY FOR A PICTURE
IT HAPPENED THAT BETH WHOSE ROOM WAS NEAR THIS REAR CORRIDOR HAD JUST GONE THERE TO DRESS FOR DINNER AND AS SHE WAS CLOSING HER DOOR SHE HEARD A WILD IMPASSIONED CRY
DID SHE TAKE ANY CLOTHING WITH HER ONLY THE DRESS SHE HAD ON SIR AND NOT EVEN A HAT OR A SHAWL WHAT WAS HER DRESS LIKE ASKED BETH QUICKLY
THEY SAY MONEY'S BEIN POURED OUT LIKEN WATER--TO GIT VOTES HE PERSISTED
THE BOY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HORSES AND SUGGESTED A METHOD OF TREATMENT THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD HELP THE NAG
HE AIN'T A NATURAL CRIMINAL YOU KNOW
IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THIS CLEVER ARRANGEMENT WOULD EASILY WIN THE FIGHT FOR HOPKINS
I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY COUNTRY'S HISTORY YET I CANNOT RECOLLECT WHERE I LIVED AND THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY IS UNKNOWN TO ME
THEY--THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I--I CAN'T BEAR THEM
IT'S HIS IDEAS I OBJECT TO AND HE'S A REPUBLICAN HAVEN'T YOU EVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN ASKED THE GIRL
YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
KENNETH PICKED UP THE RECEIVER
MOREOVER HE HAD ACQUIRED A FUND OF EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE AND WAS DELIGHTED TO MEET MR HOPKINS UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
CHAPTER V PLANNING THE WORK THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIS CAMPAIGN
NO ONE ELSE WOULD CALL SO EARLY IT'S BETH'S VOICE TALKING TO NORA ADDED HER FATHER LISTENING
I--I CAN'T BEAR IT
AT FIRST KENNETH'S MIND HELD ONLY A FEELING OF DISGUST THAT SUCH A DESECRATION OF NATURE'S GIFTS TO HUMANITY SHOULD BE ALLOWED
I'M SET ON THIS
HIS TRIAL HAS NOT YET TAKEN PLACE AND INSTEAD OF YOUR DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME APPEARING AGAINST HIM IT WOULD BE MUCH SIMPLER TO SETTLE THE MATTER RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN WHAT WAY MR FORBES I'LL MAKE YOUR MONEY LOSS GOOD IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE I CAN WELL BELIEVE IT SIR
WHEN EVENING CAME AND THEY HAD ARRIVED AT ELMHURST AGAIN LOUISE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER HER WORK OF THE DAY AND HAD MANY AMUSING TALES TO TELL OF HER EXPERIENCES
SO THAT ALL THE ELECTIONEERING OF THE GIRL POLITICIANS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF VAST SUMS OF MONEY IN PAINTING FENCES AND BARNS BUYING NEWSPAPERS AND FLAUNTING FORBES BANNERS IN THE BREEZES HAD NOT CUT INTO THE HOPKINS FOLLOWING TO ANY SERIOUS EXTENT
AND THEN SHE STUDIED HIS FACE WITH SOBER EARNESTNESS--WITH ALMOST WISTFUL LONGING
I DO NOT SAY MR FORBES IS NOT A GOOD CITIZEN SAID HE BUT THAT HE IS MISGUIDED AND UNREASONABLE
EVERYTHING NOW DEPENDS UPON DUPREE AND FAIRVIEW ANNOUNCED KENNETH BUT I CAN'T GET ANY CONNECTION WITH THEM YET
IF HE AIN'T MORE PROMPT THAN USUAL YOU'LL HAVE A LONG SPELL OF WAITING PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO OVER TO THE HOTEL AND LOOK HIM UP
LOTS OF THEM TELL BOTH SIDES THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE THEIR WAY
SHE OWES A DUTY TO HER PARENTS AND FRIENDS AS WELL AS TO HERSELF SAID KENNETH AND I SEE NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY IN THE FUTURE AS LUCY ROGERS MR BURKE MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
IT'S A PRETTY BIG SUM NOW AND HOPKINS HOLDS A MORTGAGE ON THE STOCK
ERASTUS HOPKINS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DISTRICT LENT HIS PRESENCE TO THE ASSEMBLAGE
THEN WE'VE GOT TO HAVE OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOTES TO ELECT KENNETH EXACTLY THE GIRL DREW A LONG BREATH AND LOOKED AT BETH AND LOUISE
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN WE WERE MAKING CANDY IN THE KITCHEN AND LUCY BURNED HERSELF BADLY
BUT THAT'S AN EXCUSABLE FAULT I HOPE I DESERVE MY REPUTATION MR MERRICK SAID ERASTUS STRAIGHTENING UP AT THIS PRAISE
SIT DOWN ON THIS BENCH MR ROGERS SHE SAID AND I'LL LISTEN TO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY HE SAT DOWN WILLINGLY BENT FORWARD AS HE RESTED UPON THE GARDEN BENCH AND TWIRLED HIS HAT SLOWLY IN HIS HANDS
THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR--TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE DEEPER THAN HE CARED TO MAKE EVIDENT
THE TOWN AN INSIGNIFICANT VILLAGE WAS FIVE MILES DISTANT AND SURROUNDING THE MANSION WERE MANY BROAD ACRES WHICH RATHER ISOLATED IT FROM ITS NEIGHBORS
THEY'VE CAUGHT ON TO THE OUTSIDE FAKES TO WIN VOTES
HE TOLD HER PLAINLY THAT HER COUSIN HADN'T A GHOST OF A SHOW AND THAT HE WAS GLAD OF IT
BUT THE ICE WAS BROKEN
THE GREAT CORPORATIONS WHO CONTROL THESE INDUSTRIES MAKE THEIR FORTUNES BY THIS STYLE OF ADVERTISING
I MUST BE GOING HE MUTTERED TURNING AWAY
BUT IT WAS A GENEROUS ACT TOO SAID BETH
OH LOUISE CRIED PATSY HOWEVER DID YOU GET UP SO EARLY I'VE GOT A LETTER FROM KENNETH WAS THE ANSWER AND I'M SO EXCITED I COULDN'T WAIT A MINUTE IMAGINE LOUISE BEING EXCITED SAID BETH CALMLY AS SHE KISSED UNCLE JOHN AND SAT DOWN BY PATSY'S SIDE
THE HORSES COWS PIG AND CHICKENS WERE ALIKE INSPECTED THE ROSES AND DAHLIAS VISITED AND ADMIRED AND AFTER ALL THIS THEY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS WITH OLD MARTHA THE HOUSEKEEPER AND PROCEEDED TO UNPACK THEIR TRUNKS AND GET SETTLED
AND I'LL HELP YOU ALL I CAN THIS RAMBLING SPEECH SEEMED TO IMPRESS ELIZA FAVORABLY
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A HAND IN THE GAME AND WIN IT OH UNCLE JOHN THE PROPOSITION WAS CERTAINLY DISCONCERTING AT FIRST
HE'S UP TO ALL THE TRICKS O THE TRADE IS RAST HOPKINS HERE HE BEGAN SHAKING WITH SILENT LAUGHTER AND MRS HOPKINS LOOKED AT HIM CURIOUSLY
I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO MR FORBES FOR WARNING ME YOU'LL FIND THE NEXT REPRESENTATIVE A VERY AGREEABLE MAN TO GET ALONG WITH MR MARSHALL
IT WERE SIXTY DOLLARS THEY WANTED OR TH RING
IF I'M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN MR HOPKINS HAS THROWN A BOOMERANG
YES MADAM REPLIED KENNETH ASTONISHED TO FIND WILL'S WIFE SPEAKING WITH SO MUCH REFINEMENT AND GRACIOUS EASE
I WISH WE COULD GET HIM AWAY
OH NO
OH NO
AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT TOM GAVE A HALF-FRIGHTENED GLANCE INTO ELIZA'S FACE AND THEN TURNED RED AS SHE SMILED COQUETTISHLY AND SAID
HOWEVER IT WAS NOT HIS DESIRE TO STIFLE THIS NEW-BORN ENTHUSIASM OF KENNETH'S EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED IT MISDIRECTED
IT'S A WAY THESE BAD MEN HAVE UNCLE JOHN WAS LOOKING VERY SERIOUS INDEED AND PATSY REGARDED HIM GRATEFULLY
IF HE WASN'T MY LUCY WOULD NEVER HAVE LOVED HIM
SHE SAID SHE'D RUINED TOM'S LIFE AN ALL THET AN SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE HERSELF
I'VE WALKED THE HULL COUNTY OVER A-TRYIN TO FIND LUCY
I CAN'T SAY SHE REPLIED
PRESENTLY A LIGHT STEP SOUNDED UPON THE STAIRS AND LUCY CAME INTO THE ROOM
WHO IS HOPKINS HE ASKED
BUT THET'S WHAT I THOUGHT TOO
SORRY FORBES HASN'T GOT THAT SIXTY-SIX MILL HANDS
SO HE VENTURED TO SAY
MR CUNNINGHAM FEARED THIS DEBATE WOULD PROVE A MISTAKE AS IT WOULD GIVE HOPKINS A CHANCE TO RIDICULE AND BROW-BEAT HIS OPPONENT IN PUBLIC AND HIS GREATEST TALENT AS A SPEAKER LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
YOU MUSTN'T MIND MY BEING GRUFF AND GRUMPY MR FORBES
THOMPSON WAS BEHIND HIS DESK AT THE GENERAL STORE WHEN HOPKINS WALKED IN
I HAVE NEVER BEEN MAD LET US HOPE FOR THE BEST MRS ROGERS SAID BETH
YOU HAVE FAILED IT SEEMS AND WILL ROGERS HAD FAILED
A LEETLE TOO HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR A POLITICIAN
I OUGHT TO GET A HUNDRED DOLLARS OUT OF THIS CAMPAIGN BUT RAST THINKS FIFTY IS ENOUGH
MRS HOPKINS HE ASKED QUIETLY
THE SQUIERSES ARE A SELFISH HARD-FISTED LOT AND THE OLD LADY ESPECIALLY IS A WELL KNOWN VIRAGO
MY HEART WAS LIGHT AND FREE FROM ALL CARE
IT IS REALLY A STATE OF COMA AND I WISH HER TO WAKEN IN THIS HOUSE AMID THE SCENES WITH WHICH SHE WAS FORMERLY FAMILIAR
HE MAKES A REPORT TO ME EVERY EVENING REMARKED KENNETH
SO EVERY WOMAN WANTS TO BELONG
IT WAS IN THE TOWN HALL AN ALL THREE OF THE GIRLS MADE SPEECHES WHAT ABOUT ABOUT MR FORBES AND HOW HE ORTER BE ELECTED
SO IF SUCH A LAW CAN BE PASSED I'LL DO ALL I CAN TO ELECT THE MAN WHO WILL PASS IT I THOUGHT AS MUCH THE OLD LAWYER REPLIED SMILING
YOU SEE YOUNG FORBES IS WELL LIKED AND HE'S QUITE A DECENT FELLOW
THE PAIN HAD EASED ON THE JOURNEY AND NOW THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THE OFFENDING TOOTH PULLED WAS WEIGHING HEAVILY UPON PATSY'S MIND
PATSY BOUNDED IN BESIDE HIM AND STARTLED HIM
BUT HERE WAS A WELCOME DIVERSION
WHY HE'S A FOOL THAT'S WHAT HE IS
AND YOU SAY HIS ISSUE IS UNPOPULAR THAT'S WHAT IT IS
MR FORBES IS BOUND TO BE ELECTED
MR HOPKINS WAS DISTINCTLY RELIEVED
WE'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE MORNING BUT THEY WOULD NOT MOVE
THE DOOR OF DR SQUIERS'S OFFICE STOOD AJAR AND SHE HESITATED WHETHER TO ENTER OR NOT
BEFORE I LOST MY MEMORY FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEY SAT SILENTLY REGARDING ONE ANOTHER THE EXPRESSIVE FEATURES OF LOUISE SHOWING A SILENT SYMPATHY
IT WAS THEN THAT I INVENTED THE NAME OF ELIZA PARSONS
I HAD TO STAND BY LUCY--SHE'S SO SWEET AND GENTLE AND SO SENSITIVE
I ABHOR CROWDS
ONE CANNOT TOUCH PITCH WITHOUT BEING DEFILED SAID MR WATSON GRAVELY AND POLITICS AS MR HOPKINS KNOWS IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN PITCH I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MY GIRLS HAVE DONE TO FORFEIT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ASSERTED UNCLE JOHN STOUTLY
YOU KNOW MY NAME IS NOT ELIZA PARSONS
YOU MUST REMEMBER I HAVE COVERED FIVE YEARS IN THIS ESTIMATE AS DID MR HOPKINS IN HIS AND IF YOU WILL FIGURE IT OUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THE YEARLY AVERAGE OF EARNINGS IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS TO EACH FARMER
HE HAD MARRIED AGAIN AND DISINHERITED ME
JUST TO LIVE SEEMED PLEASURE ENOUGH
WHERE IS SHE MARTHA
THEN IT STRUCK HIM THAT THERE WAS A PECULIAR AIR OF NEATNESS ABOUT THE PLACES HE PASSED
THE BOY NEEDS A GOOD SHAKING UP AND MORE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS FELLOW-MEN
SAY FORBES HAS TWICE EIGHTEEN FOR HIS PLURALITY INSTEAD OF EIGHTEEN
BETH TRIED TO HELP THE OLD MAN
HE TRIED AGAIN TO DRAW HER INTO CONVERSATION BUT SHE SHOWED ANNOYANCE AND RESENTED HIS PERSISTENCE
TELL ME WHAT IS LUCY LIKE SHE'S LIKE NELL USED TO BE BUT WE DON'T KNOW YOUR WIFE
THE IDEA IS TOO PROGRESSIVE AND ADVANCED TO BE CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME HE STATED POSITIVELY
YOU ARE ANNOYING ME
I'LL GO AND LOOK UP THE NEXT TRAIN
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY WORSE TOM
I'M TOO OLD A RAT TO BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE THIS
IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE AND YOU THINK WE MIGHT HIRE HOPKINS TO PASS SUCH A LAW NO
WHO WOULD DO THESE THINGS BUT AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER WHO IS SO INEXPERIENCED IN LIFE THAT HE SETS HIS OWN FLIMSY JUDGMENT AGAINST THAT OF THE PEOPLE THE ORATOR PAUSED IMPRESSIVELY TO WAIT FOR MORE CHEERS BUT THE AUDIENCE WAS SILENT
I ONLY KNOW I HAVE A HORROR OF HER A SUDDEN SHRINKING WHENEVER HER NAME IS MENTIONED
HOW MANY VOTES DID YOU WIN ASKED UNCLE JOHN SMILING AT HER
AND AS IF TO VERIFY BETH'S SUSPICIONS ELIZA WAS SEEN TO LEAVE THE GROUNDS AFTER DUSK AND MEET MR HOPKINS IN THE LANE
DISAPPOINTMENT UNNERVED THEM MORE THAN VICTORY WOULD HAVE DONE
WHO IS TO OPPOSE THE HONORABLE ERASTUS ON THE--ON OUR SIDE I DON'T KNOW YET
THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHAMPAGNE DINNERS AND OTHER COSTLY EXCESSES WHILE AT THE STATE CAPITAL AND HIS FELLOW LEGISLATORS CONSIDERED HIM A GOOD FELLOW ALTHOUGH RATHER LAX IN KEEPING HIS END UP MOREOVER HE EMPLOYED A GOOD TAILOR AND WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP UP AN APPEARANCE OF SOUND FINANCIAL STANDING
SHE'S QUICK AND IMPULSIVE BUT SHE--SHE COULDN'T ACT
LOUISE FELT A GLOW OF TRIUMPH BUT MANAGED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION RELATING IN AN AMUSING WAY THE ANXIETY OF THE ELMHURST FOLKS WHEN THE FIRST RETURNS SEEMED TO INDICATE THE ELECTION OF HOPKINS
I'LL BE CAREFUL SIR SHE PROMISED
BUT KENNETH FORBES THE YOUTHFUL PROPRIETOR WAS AT TIMES DREADFULLY BORED BY THE LONELINESS OF IT ALL THOUGH NO ONE COULD BETTER HAVE APPRECIATED THE BEAUTIES OF HIS FINE ESTATE
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT THERE WAS AN INSPIRING AIR OF BUSINESS ABOUT THESE PREPARATIONS AND THE GIRLS WERE ALL EAGER TO BEGIN WORK
I'VE HAD A TASTE OF THAT MEDICINE MYSELF WE'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST POPULAR YOUNG LADIES IN THIS DISTRICT EXCLAIMED PATSY
ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU ASKED THE POLITE DRUGGIST
THE SIGHT OF SOME FRIENDLY FACES WILL BE A GREAT RELIEF THE OLD LAWYER SIGHED
AND PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS AT THE LAST MINUTE TOO
OUR FIRST BUSINESS MUST BE TO ASSURE OURSELVES THAT WE ARE RIGHT IN THIS CONJECTURE
PATSY AND UNCLE JOHN DROVE AWAY
SIT DOWN MR ROGERS SHE SAID AND TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS I GUESS I'LL HEV TO SPEAK OUT AN TELL ALL SAID HE HIS VOICE TREMBLING A LITTLE ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT FER A MINNIT I COULD SEE MY WAY WITHOUT
WELL WHAT'S TO BE DONE DEMANDED LOUISE FOR THE SECOND TIME
THEN HE CALLED FOR THE CHICAGO FIRM
HE'S GOING TO BE BADLY BEATEN I THINK I'LL TAKE TWO OUNCES OF THIS PERFUMERY
ON OCCASIONS SHE LOVED TO TALK AS ERASTUS HAD LONG AGO DISCOVERED
I WANT TO HIRE YOUR SERVICES TO HELP US IN THE ELECTION SHE SAID BRISKLY
BRIGGS WAS ONE OF HIS STAND-BYS AND THE HERALD HERETOFORE HAD ALWAYS SUPPORTED HIM
WE CONFESS SUCH A DRESS ISN'T QUITE BECOMING BUT WE SUPPOSE HOPKINS KNOWS THIS KEEPS BUSINESS HUMMING AS THE GIRLS CEASED SINGING KENNETH SAID
THE INVITATION WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED BY THE RURAL POPULATION
ABSOLUTELY
THERE'S SOME SHREWD POLITICIAN BEHIND THEM I KNOW OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE NAILED US UP IN OUR COFFINS WITH SUCH BUSINESS-LIKE CELERITY TALK SENSE ARCHIE
YOU DON'T SMOKE DO YOU MR FORBES NO MR MARKHAM THEN DON'T BEGIN IT
I'D FIGHT TO THE LAST GASP IF I HAD ANY SHOW TO WIN
I THINK SAID UNCLE JOHN WHO HAD BEEN A QUIET LISTENER UNTIL NOW THAT KENNETH HAS ASSUMED ENOUGH EXPENSE IN THIS MATTER OH UNCLE THE REMONSTRANCE WAS FROM ALL THREE OF THE GIRLS
IN PURSUANCE OF THE TASK SET ME BEGAN MR BURKE I HAD MET WITH SUCH ABSOLUTE FAILURE TO TRACE THE MISSING GIRL THAT I BEGAN TO SUSPECT NO ORDINARY CONDITIONS WERE ATTACHED TO THIS CASE
THE ADVERTISING SIGN BUSINESS IN THIS PART OF THE STATE WAS CONTROLLED BY TWO FIRMS WHO CONTRACTED DIRECTLY WITH THE ADVERTISERS AND THEN HAD THE SIGNS PAINTED UPON SPACES SECURED FROM THE FARMERS BY THEIR WIDE-AWAKE AGENTS
BUT THE MOST ASTONISHING THING WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THE GROUP OF GIRLS
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN COWARDLY ENOUGH TO GIVE UP ASKED PATRICIA BOLDLY
BETH FELT THAT SHE WAS INTRUDING AND KNEW THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO
HE'S AFRAID NOT SHE SAID AND IT'S WORRYING HIM TO DEATH
HE DID NOT CONFIDE ALL HIS SCHEMES TO PATSY BUT HAVING URGED HIS NIECES TO ATTEMPT THIS CONQUEST HE HAD NO INTENTION OF ALLOWING THEM TO SUFFER DEFEAT IF HE COULD HELP IT
THE YOUNG MAN IS NOT REALLY BAD AND TOM'S A FINE BOY SHE CRIED WITH EAGERNESS
IF YOU ALLOWED THEM TO DO SO THEY WOULD PAINT SIGNS ON THE DRESSES OF YOUR CHILDREN AND WIVES SO CALLOUS ARE THEY TO ALL DECENCY AND SO REGARDLESS OF PRIVATE RIGHTS
FAIRVIEW JUST ACROSS THE BORDER IN WASHINGTON COUNTY IS THE BIGGEST VILLAGE HAVE YOU AN AUTOMOBILE NO
OR ELSE WE MUST TRUST TO TIME OR AN ACCIDENT TO AWAKEN HER DORMANT MENTAL FACULTIES
THE GIRL SIGHED GATHERED UP HER PURCHASES AND WENT INTO THE HARDWARE STORE
LOUISE ASKED HIS ADVICE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO WIN VOTES AND SAID SHE DEPENDED A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS JUDGMENT
WE PAINTED OUT ALL THE SIGNS IN THIS SECTION AT OUR OWN EXPENSE THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL YOUR HOMES ARE WITHOUT THEM
FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSIVE SILENCE WHILE EVERYONE EAGERLY INQUIRINGLY OR DOUBTFULLY LOOKED AT THE DETECTIVE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIVERSE ACCEPTANCE OF HIS STATEMENT
TOM GATES'S ANXIETY TO GIVE SATISFACTION MADE HIM WILLING TO DO ANYTHING BUT THEY REFRAINED FROM SENDING HIM OFTEN TO TOWN BECAUSE HE WAS SENSITIVE TO THE AVERTED LOOKS AND EVIDENT REPULSION OF THOSE WHO KNEW HE HAD RECENTLY BEEN A JAIL-BIRD BUT THERE WAS PLENTY FOR HIM TO DO AT ELMHURST WHERE THEY WERE ALL AS BUSY AS BEES
THAT'S WHY I TOLD RAST NOT TO HAVE ANY TRUCK WITH HER WHEN SHE CAME HERE BRIGHT AND EARLY ONE MORNING AND ASKED FOR WORK OH SHE CAME HERE DID SHE WHILE I WAS GETTIN BREAKFAST
MR WATSON RODE IN HIS BUGGY ALL OVER THEIR DISTRICT DURING THE NEXT FORTNIGHT AND INTERVIEWED THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN OF THE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT
HE BECAME AN OLD MAN EARLY IN LIFE AND HIS LACK OF ENERGY KEPT US VERY POOR
I OWNED ONE LAS YEAR BUT HE DIED ON ME AN I CAN'T GET ANOTHER NOHOW DID YOU WALK HERE ASKED BETH
CHEERS WHO THEN DARES TO DENOUNCE THEM AS FOOLS
YOU'RE SAID TO BE A GOOD MAN MR HOPKINS
ON THE CONTRARY HE'S WILLING AND ABLE TO SPEND A GOOD DEAL IN PASSING LAWS THAT WILL BENEFIT HIS DISTRICT AND HOPKINS DON'T YOU KNOW MR HOPKINS SHE ASKED POINTEDLY
OLD HOPKINS WON'T HAVE MUCH TO CROW OVER IF WAIT A MINUTE SAID KENNETH
THANK THE LORD THIS THING IS NEARLY OVER AND WE'LL HAVE A FEW WEEKS OF PEACE IT IS RATHER IMPOSING ON YOU REMARKED THE MAN FOLLOWING HER TO THE SITTING-ROOM WHERE HE SAT DOWN WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS
USUALLY A YOUNG MAN MAKING HIS MAIDEN SPEECH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFIDENT
INDEED LOUISE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE SO COMPLEX AS TO BE A PUZZLE TO EVERYONE INCLUDING THEMSELVES
I'VE DONE A LOT OF CLEVER WORK
UNLESS UNLESS WHAT SIR UNLESS WE COME TO THE RESCUE OF THE REPUBLICANS AND TAKE A HAND IN LOCAL POLITICS OURSELVES MY LAD KENNETH PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR AND ROSE FROM THE TABLE
THE PHYSICIAN APPROACHED THE SLEEPING GIRL AND GENTLY LIFTED THE LIDS OF HER EYES
INDEED SOME WERE PROUD OF THEM AND BELIEVED IT A MARK OF DISTINCTION TO HAVE THEIR FENCES AND SHEDS ANNOUNCE AN EYE-REMEDY OR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PICKLES
A SUGGESTION THE FARMER RECEIVED WITH REAL GRATITUDE
MR CUMMINGS WHO WAS TO PROFIT BY THE DEAL WAS CALLED TO A PRIVATE CONSULTATION AND AGREED TO SLAUGHTER KENNETH FORBES TO SECURE VOTES FOR HIMSELF
WHAT IS IT NOW ASKED THE BOY ROUSING HIMSELF FROM A FIT OF ABSTRACTION
ELIZA PARSONS IS NO GHOST DECLARED BETH
FORGET ALL ABOUT IT WELL O COURSE MISS THAT HELPED A LOT
THERE IS NO RESPECT FOR PERSONAL PRIVACY ON THE ADVERTISER'S PART
THERE'S A BENCH HERE WE'VE COME TO INQUIRE ABOUT YOUR CASE GATES SAID KENNETH
HAVE YOU REALLY LOST YOUR MEMORY SHE ASKED
HE COULD NOT GO FAST FOR THE BEAST WAS VERY LAME
THE BOY AND THE GIRL BOTH PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY THEY COULD ASSIST MRS ROGERS AND THAT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER CHILD
THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE STRENUOUS AGE AND NO SECTION OF THE COUNTRY HAS PROGRESSED MORE RAPIDLY THAN THIS THE EIGHTH DISTRICT OF OUR GREAT AND GLORIOUS STATE
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS YOU'LL WANT TOO MUCH SQUIERS LAUGHED BITTERLY
IMMEDIATELY HER SPIRITS ROSE
IT WAS A BUSY PLACE PERHAPS THE BUSIEST IN THE WHOLE OF THE EIGHTH DISTRICT AND IN IT WERE EMPLOYED A LARGE NUMBER OF MEN
HE WRITES ME HE CAN SEE NO HOPE FOR THE PEOPLE ARE ALL AGAINST HIM ADDED LOUISE
DOZENS MORE WERE BEING EDUCATED AT UNIVERSITIES AT UNCLE JOHN'S EXPENSE
IT'S BECAUSE THE PUBLIC'S SO INDISCRIMINATING THAT I'VE NOT RUN FOR ANYTHING SINCE--EXCEPT TH STREET-CAR BUT IT'S A BIG GAME SAID UNCLE JOHN STANDING AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS HANDS DEEP IN HIS POCKETS
AH THIS IS MR MERRICK I BELIEVE BEGAN MR HOPKINS SUAVELY
OL WILL ROGERS
IT'S A NAME I--I INVENTED I THINK I UNDERSTAND SAID LOUISE WITH A LITTLE NOD
BURKE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND I AM CONFIDENT HE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACE THE GIRL IN TIME THANK YOU SIR THEN HE FOLLOWED THE BUTLER AWAY TO HIS ROOM AND AFTER THE GIRLS HAD DISCUSSED HIM AND EXPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY FOR THE UNFORTUNATE FELLOW THEY ALL TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF THE CAMPAIGN
IF HE ISN'T A FIT MAN IT'S OUR DUTY TO PREVENT HIM FROM REPRESENTING US THE YOUNG MAN NODDED SOMEWHAT DREAMILY
THESE FRIZZLE-HEADED FEMALES CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR ARE TRYING TO MAKE YOUR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AS REBELLIOUS AND UNREASONABLE AS THEY ARE THEMSELVES
BUT SHE MAINTAINED A CHEERFUL FRONT
I'M WHOLLY IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GIRLS KEN AND I BELIEVE IN THEM BUT CONSIDER THE HUMILIATION TO WHICH THEY WILL SUBJECT THEMSELVES
AND IT'S BREAKING HIS HEART UNCLE JOHN THE LITTLE MAN NODDED SILENTLY
WHY HOW NICE CRIED LOUISE
I WAS LIKE THE BIRDS WHO SEE THE SUNSHINE AND FEEL THE BREEZE AND ARE CONTENT TO SING AND BE HAPPY
BUT THE THING THAT REALLY WON THE FIGHT WAS PATSY'S SORE TOOTH CHAPTER XXII THE AWAKENING JAMES AND MR BURKE MET THE GREAT SPECIALIST IN BRAIN DISEASES AT THE NOON TRAIN ON WEDNESDAY AND DROVE HIM TO ELMHURST
KENNETH AND BETH WENT AWAY QUITE HAPPY WITH THEIR SUCCESS AND THE MANAGER STOOD IN HIS LITTLE WINDOW AND WATCHED THEM DEPART
AN HE TOOK PRIVATE LESSONS IN BOOKKEEPIN FROM OL CHEESEMAN
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO FAIRVIEW TONIGHT YOU KNOW DO AS YOU PLEASE SHE ANSWERED CARELESSLY
THE LITTLE GROUP OF WORKERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITH INQUIRING EYES AND PATSY COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM CRYING
FOR I DON'T KNOW MYSELF SHE LEANED FORWARD IN HER CHAIR AND ADDED IN A WHISPER
I DON'T SAY I DID RIGHT
BUT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO INCRIMINATE MYSELF RAST
I THOUGHT YOUR GOOSE WAS COOKED THE MINNIT THESE GIRLS GOT TO WORK MR HOPKINS STARED AT HER WITH A DAZED EXPRESSION
I CAN DO TYPEWRITING AND STENOGRAPHY MR FORBES HE SAID AND I CAN KEEP ACCOUNTS
ONE REASON FOR THIS WAS THAT THEY HELD LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HIM
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE REGISTRATION BOOKS IN YOUR POSSESSION I ADMIT THAT WAS THE REPLY
THEY'RE SURE TO
THEN HE SUMMONED HIS SUPERINTENDENT AND SAID
BUT HE NEVER SAID HOW HE HAPPENED TO FIND THE GIRL OR WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT HER HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE WILL BE DEFEATED HE ASKED
HE SAID HE KNEW ELIZA PARSONS AND THERE IS NO ELIZA PARSONS
YOU MAY PERHAPS BUY THE PRIVILEGE OF MAINTAINING THE ROCKS OF THE GLEN FREE FROM ADVERTISING
HE SET TYPE FOR HIS PAPER BESIDES EDITING IT AND UNCLE JOHN FOUND HIM WEARING A MUCH SOILED APRON WITH HIS BARE ARMS AND FINGERS SMEARED WITH PRINTER'S INK
THESE SIGNS WERE CONTRACTED FOR BY THE YEAR BUT THE FIRMS CONTROLLING THE SPACES ALWAYS INSERTED PROTECTIVE CLAUSES THAT PROVIDED FOR THE REMOVAL OF ANY SIGN WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS REQUIRED SUCH REMOVAL
ISN'T IT GIRLS IT'S CHILD'S PLAY OBSERVED LOUISE LANGUIDLY
THAT IS AN EXCELLENT PLAN AND WOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN DETERMINING THE MANAGER TO ABANDON THE PLOT I'LL GO AND SEE HOPKINS MYSELF ANNOUNCED UNCLE JOHN
TABLES WERE TO BE SPREAD UPON THE LAWN FOR THE LATE OCTOBER WEATHER WAS MILD AND DELIGHTFUL AND LOUISE PLANNED TO FEED THE WOMEN IN A WAY THAT THEY WOULD LONG REMEMBER
KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
THE LITTLE TABLE WAS SET IN THE HUMBLE LIVING-ROOM AND THE FRAGRANT ODOR OF COFFEE PERVADED THE HOUSE
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SIGNS ARE OFTEN OUT OF PLACE AND--AND INHARMONIOUS TO BE SURE
TOM GATES IS NOW FREE AND CAN BEGIN LIFE ANEW HIS TROUBLE WILL FOLLOW HIM EVERYWHERE SAID MRS ROGERS WITH CONVICTION
AS I HAVE SAID I HAVE A SENSITIVE NATURE
LOUISE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE FARMERS RETORTED PATSY
SHE WAS LAUGHING KEN I NOTICED IT AND SHE WASN'T UNHAPPY A BIT
IT DIDN'T NEED IT JAMES
LUCY DIDN'T TAKE IT AN AFTER THEY'D TRIED TO MAKE MY GAL CONFESS AS SHE WAS A THIEF THEY GIVE ER THREE DAYS TO HAND UP THE RING OR THE MONEY IT WAS WORTH OR ELSE THEY'D HEV HER ARRESTED AND SENT T JAIL
IF YOU PULL THROUGH AND TAKE YOUR SEAT IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU'LL OWE IT ALL TO THESE GIRLS THAT IS TRUE SMILED THE LAWYER
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
SO YOU MUST TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE OR NOT
WHY ISN'T THIS ELIZA PARSONS YES SIR SHE REPLIED CARELESSLY
I THOUGHT TO SAVE HER AND DROVE HER MAD INSTEAD YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT DECLARED KENNETH
IT WOULD COST THE BOY SOMETHING BUT HE WOULD GAIN HIS MONEY'S WORTH IN EXPERIENCE
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE RESUMED HER OCCUPATION OF CUTTING ROSES
THE FIRST TIME I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR I SAW A STRANGE FACE REFLECTED THERE
AND THERE WERE OTHER REASONS THAT MADE IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO SUPPORT HOPKINS
I ONLY SAY I'D DO THE SAME THING AGAIN COULDN'T HER PARENTS HAVE HELPED HER INQUIRED KENNETH
SHE SAID HER NAME WAS ELIZA PARSONS AN SHE WAS LOOKING FER A JOB
KENNETH NEEDS MORAL ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE JUST NOW HE'S IMAGINING ALL SORTS OF HORRORS AND MAKING HIMSELF MISERABLE SAID LOUISE
IT STOOD OPEN BUT ELIZA HAD NOT NOTICED THAT AS IT WAS BEHIND HER
HE APPROACHED ONE OF THE WHITE-OVERALLED MEN WHO WAS LOADING CANS OF PAINT INTO A WAGON AND INQUIRED
PRESENTLY THE MAN ASKED WITH A GRIN
HE ALSO WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS DAY'S WORK AND AGREED TO RIDE OVER TO FAIRVIEW THE NEXT DAY WITH HER AND CARRY THE WAR INTO THIS THE LARGEST VILLAGE IN KENNETH'S DISTRICT
GO RIGHT TO TH POINT AN THEY'LL SAY YES OR NO BETH LAUGHED MERRILY AND THE BOY SMILED AS HE WIELDED HIS BRUSH WITH DELICATE STROKES
HE TRIED TO THINK WHAT TO DO AND IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HIS VISITOR POSITIVELY KNEW ANYTHING HE WOULD NOT ACT IN THIS ABSURD MANNER BUT COME STRAIGHT TO THE POINT
THIS GIRL POSSESSED MANNERISMS THAT LUCY HAD NEVER EXHIBITED IN ALL THE YEARS HE HAD KNOWN HER
AT THAT TIME WILL ROGERS WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING AND MANLY OF THE COUNTRY LADS AROUND HERE
HOW GOOD OF YOU IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE DETECTIVE THAT CAME TO SEE MRS ROGERS SAID TOM MUSINGLY
MY INSTINCT REVOLTS AT THE DESECRATION
WELL SOME OF THEM SURELY MUST BE COMING OR UNCLE JOHN WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR THE DRAG
SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THE SEARCH FOR LUCY THE DISCOVERY THAT ONE OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST RESEMBLED THE MISSING GIRL AND THE DETECTIVE'S CONCLUSION THAT ELIZA PARSONS WAS NONE OTHER THAN LUCY ROGERS WHO WAS SUFFERING FROM A PECULIAR MENTAL ABERRATION AND HAD FORGOTTEN EVERY DETAIL OF HER FORMER LIFE
YOU CAN'T DO MUCH MORE THAN AVERAGE THE THING BY MEANS OF A CANVASS BY NINE O'CLOCK COMPLETE RETURNS FROM THE PART OF JEFFERSON COUNTY INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTH DISTRICT SHOWED A NET GAIN OF ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT FOR HOPKINS--A LEAD THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME
BUT IT IS TRUE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT PATSY DOYLE HE ASKED THE SCOWL DEEPENING
AND YET IT ISN'T LUCY WHO IS ELIZA PARSONS SHE REFUSES TO SAY WHERE SHE CAME FROM
WHY I KNEW ALL THE TIME WE WOULD WIN
THE BANKER A DIGNIFIED OLD GENTLEMAN OF CONSIDERABLE ABILITY CAME OUT OF HIS PRIVATE OFFICE AND GREETED HIS VISITOR VERY CORDIALLY
BUT SINCE HOPKINS DEFEATED THEM LAST TERM THEY SEEM TO BE TERRIFIED AND NO ONE LIKES TO OFFER HIMSELF AS A POSSIBLE SACRIFICE THAT FEELING WILL PROBABLY ELECT MR HOPKINS DECLARED KENNETH WITH CONVICTION
A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO EVERYBODY
WE COULDN'T TRUST HIM THEN WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE I'LL THINK IT OVER MY LAD AND LET YOU KNOW THEN HE WALKED AWAY LEAVING KENNETH MUCH PLEASED WITH THE IDEA HE HAD ADVANCED
WE'RE THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FAIR AS HEAVEN'S ORBS
BUT I AM SURE I AM DOING RIGHT
UNCLE JOHN LAUGHED
AND MR BURKE SAYS THIS IS THE MOST MYSTIFYING CASE HE HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED
I'LL MAKE IT A CONDITION OF OUR AGREEING NOT TO PROSECUTE THE MAN IT LOOKS AS IF WE WERE GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION SAID UNCLE JOHN IN A PLEASED VOICE
HOW MUCH WILL THEY BE WHY THE VERY BEST--THESE IMPORTED PERFECTOS YOU KNOW--ARE WORTH SIX DOLLARS A BOX OF FIFTY
BUT THIS CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS A SUBJECT OF SMALL IMPORTANCE
BECAUSE THROUGH CUSTOM THEY HAD COME TO TOLERATE SUCH THINGS AND COULD SEE NO HARM IN THEM REPLIED THE LAWYER
AN YOU BLAMED IDIOT
IT SEEMS TO ME QUITE EASY THAT'S THE WOMAN OF IT SIR LAUGHED KENNETH
I KNOW EVERY MAN THAT COMES TO THIS TOWN MISS AS WELL AS ANY YOU'LL FIND HE SAID
WE MEAN BUSINESS IF YOU WIN SAID THE MAJOR I'LL RUN FOR ALDERMAN ON A PETTICOAT PLATFORM AND HIRE YOUR SERVICES CHAPTER II THE ARTIST TO MOST PEOPLE THE GREAT RAMBLING MANSION AT ELMHURST WITH ITS AMPLE GROUNDS AND PROFUSION OF FLOWERS AND SHRUBBERY WOULD AFFORD ENDLESS DELIGHT
WHEN HE LOOKED AT TOM GATES HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO SEE HIM AND HIS MANNER CONVEYED THE IMPRESSION THAT HE DISLIKED TO ATTRACT NOTICE
I WANT TO HAVE A WORD WITH THEM THE REQUEST CAME JUST IN TIME FOR THE MEN WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO STREAM OUT OF THE MILL
HE WON'T REFUSE TO DO WHAT YOU ASK HIM FOR A MAN ALWAYS LISTENS TO HIS WIFE WHEN HE KNOWS SHE'S RIGHT
RAST DON'T LET MUCH GET AWAY FROM HIM YOU'RE VERY CLEVER MRS SIMMONS
WHEN HE WAS USHERED INTO THE LIBRARY THE YOUNG LADIES WERE ATTRACTED BY THE PHYSICIAN AT ONCE AND FROM THE FIRST GLANCE WERE INSPIRED BY CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS
I WOULDN'T MIND MY OWN PUNISHMENT BUT IT DROVE MY LUCY MAD SEE HERE SAID KENNETH STERNLY YOU ARE GETTING MORBID YOUNG MAN AND PRETTY SOON YOU'LL BE MAD YOURSELF
THE GIRLS HAVE A FINE SHOW TO WIN
I DO AND LATHAM FROWNED A LITTLE
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SAID THE MOTHER SADLY
THIS UNCLE JOHN WAS INDEED A WHIMSICAL CHARACTER AS THE READER WILL PRESENTLY PERCEIVE
GOOD DAY SIR GOOD DAY MR BURKE WHEN THE DETECTIVE HAD GONE MR MARSHALL SAT IN A BROWN STUDY FOR A FEW MOMENTS
THESE GIRLS BRIGHT CHEERY AND WHOLESOME AS THEY WERE PENETRATED THE BOY'S RESERVE AND DREW HIM OUT OF HIS MISANTHROPIC MOODS
TWICE LOUISE WAS ASKED TO LEAVE A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A PROSELYTE AND ONCE A DOG WAS SET UPON BETH BY AN IRATE FARMER WHO RESENTED HER AUTOMOBILE AS MUCH AS HE DID HER MISSION
HE WAS FAIRLY PROSPEROUS BEFORE THAT FOR MRS ROGERS WAS AN ENERGETIC AND SENSIBLE WOMAN AND KEPT OLD WILL HARD AT WORK
THERE IS GETTING TO BE TOO MUCH CORRESPONDENCE FOR MR WATSON TO ATTEND TO AND I OUGHT TO RELIEVE HIM OF MANY OTHER DETAILS
YES CONSIDERABLE
BUT HE WAS SHREWD AND PROSPERED AND WHEN HE GREW UP BECAME A COUNTY-CLERK OR TAX-COLLECTOR
MAY I USE YOUR LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE OF COURSE SIR UNCLE JOHN HAD SECURED CONSIDERABLE INFORMATION FROM MR WATSON AND THIS ENABLED HIM TO ACT COMPREHENSIVELY
HE'S JUST ONE O RAST'S POLITICIANS AND I PROBABLY TREATED THE FELLOW BETTER THAN HE DESERVED CHAPTER XVIII ELIZA PARSONS ON SUNDAY MORNING MR BURKE AGAIN APPEARED AT ELMHURST AND TOLD KENNETH HE WANTED AN INTERVIEW WITH ELIZA PARSONS
THERE A RED-LETTERED ANNOUNCEMENT OF SIMPSON'S SOAP STARED HIM IN THE FACE
I--I AM NOT WELL TODAY
THE COUNTRY AROUND ELMHURST IS THICKLY SETTLED WITH AGRICULTURISTS FOR THE FARMS ARE RICH AND PRODUCTIVE IN THAT PART OF THE STATE
PRETTY THIN MR MERRICK
HE'S TRYIN TO MAKE ME PUT UP THAT HUNDRED--AN I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DO IT HE LOOKED OVER THE OTHER NEWSPAPERS WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON HIS DESK IN THE SITTING-ROOM AND WAS DISGUSTED TO FIND ALL BUT ONE OF THE SEVEN PAPERS IN THE DISTRICT SUPPORTING FORBES
CHAPTER III DON QUIXOTE WHEN KENNETH GOT HOME HE TOLD MR WATSON OF HIS DISCOVERY AND ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO WRITE TO THE SIGN PAINTER AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE
ONLY A SHORT TIME
SHE HAD NO ESPECIAL AIR OF DISTINCTION
FOR A TIME MR WATSON SAT SILENTLY MUSING
PLAY ME THAT NOCTURNE THAT I LIKE BETH WE'VE GOT TO SPEAK OF THIS KENNETH AND SPEAK OF IT OFTEN
IT'S MY RESPECTED ADVERSARY BUT THE GIRL
MR HOPKINS HAD THEREFORE BECOME SO ENRAGED THAT AGAINST THE ADVICE OF HIS FRIENDS HE ISSUED A CIRCULAR SNEERING AT WOMEN IN POLITICS THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MR HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS
SUCH WAS THE DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS WHEN OUR STORY OPENS
BUT THERE WERE A FEW WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY TALKED WITH THE BOY WHO UNDERSTOOD HIM BETTER AND HINTED THAT HE MIGHT DEVELOP INTO QUITE A MAN IN TIME
THEN MARSHALL MOUNTED A LUMBER PILE AND ADDRESSED THEM BRIEFLY
ALL AMERICANS ARE LOYAL CITIZENS WHICHEVER SIDE THEY ADOPT IN POLITICS
I'M NOT VERY BAD BUT I'M RESTLESS AND CAN'T SLEEP AND I WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME AND AMUSE ME ELIZA LAUGHED
IT SHOWED A GAIN OF FORTY-THREE VOTES FOR HOPKINS AND A CONSEQUENT LOSS FOR FORBES
THEN PATSY WENT OVER TO THE GENERAL STORE AND THERE SHE MET HER FIRST REBUFF
MONROE COUNTY WHERE BOTH FORBES AND HOPKINS RESIDED WAS ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS OF THE STATE
IT'S ONLY HER MANNER THAT IS DIFFERENT WHEN I FIRST SAW HER BEFORE TOM CAME I WAS ASTONISHED AT HER RESEMBLANCE TO MRS ROGERS ANNOUNCED BETH
A HUNDRED MIND YOU
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR LUCY SIR NIGHT AND DAY
SHE'S GOING TO TALK TO THEIR WIVES WIVES DON'T VOTE PATSY THEY TELL THEIR HUSBANDS HOW TO VOTE THOUGH DECLARED LOUISE WITH A LAUGH
I HAVE A REASON FOR ASKING WHAT REASON SHE DEMANDED SUDDENLY SERIOUS AGAIN
A GOOD DEAL LIKEN HER MOTHER
BUT I GUESS YOUR GAME IS UP HE MADE NO REPLY
AND A MOMENT LATER HAD REGAINED HER LIGHTNESS OF MANNER
SHE'S ONE OF THE MAIDS HERE AT ELMHURST AND YOU'RE QUITE LIKELY TO SEE HER AGAIN HAS SHE BEEN HERE LONG HE ASKED EAGERLY
LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER MOTHER A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM PATSY'S APARTMENT AND HER COUSIN BETH DEGRAF WAS STAYING WITH HER FOR A TIME
ONLY MILDLY SIR WHAT IS HE PAYING YOU WHY RAST AND I HAVEN'T COME TO A DEFINITE SETTLEMENT YET
ONE OF THESE GESTURES BUMPED AGAINST THE HONORABLE ERASTUS'S RIGHT EYE WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THE EYE WAS BADLY INJURED
IT GRIEVED MR WATSON TO NOTE THIS
IT WAS HARD TO REALIZE THAT A REFINED BEAUTIFUL AND EDUCATED GIRL HAD MADE SO SAD A MISTAKE OF HER LIFE AND SUFFERED SO MANY AFFLICTIONS AS A CONSEQUENCE
WHAT DO YOU WANT YOUR HUSBAND ASKED ME TO COME HERE AND WAIT FOR HIM
THE BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WAS RUINED--ONLY THE GLARING ADVERTISEMENT CAUGHT AND HELD THE EYE OF THE OBSERVER
AND IF HE TURNS OUT AS WELL AS I EXPECT HE WILL SOON BE ABLE TO MARRY LUCY AND GIVE HER A COMFORTABLE HOME
MAY I ASK HOW YOU DISCOVERED ALL THIS HE ADDED
PERHAPS YOU CAN GET THAT TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED BACK
MR HOPKINS HAD COME TO REALIZE THAT HE HAD THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE ON HIS HANDS AND THAT DEFEAT MEANT HIS POLITICAL RUIN
BUT AFTER TEN DAYS THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY AND THE BOY HEAVED A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO EXTENDING THE CAMPAIGN
OF COURSE
THEN LOUISE ASKED
ELIZA PARSONS WAS NO SPY OF MINE
IF YOU SEND THE BOY TO PRISON YOU WILL STILL SUFFER THE LOSS OF THE MONEY
HOPKINS GOSSIPS THE HOME OF REPRESENTATIVE HOPKINS WAS NOT A VERY IMPOSING EDIFICE
WHAT MEANS WILL YOU EMPLOY SIR SHE ASKED
ISN'T IT GIRLS SAID BETH
IN SOME PLACES A SIGN-BOARD HAS BEEN BUILT IN THEIR YARDS OR FIELDS ADVERTISING MEDICINES OR GROCERIES OR TOBACCO
I FEARED SOMETHING LIKE IT WHEN YOU INSISTED ON TAKING A HAND IN THE GAME BUT THEY LAUGHED AT HIM AND AT MR HOPKINS AND DECLARED THEY WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED
WHAT FOR HE DEMANDED
BUT WHATEVER THE GIRL MANAGERS UNDERTOOK THEY DID WELL
I DON'T KEEP TRACK O SUCH THINGS
PAH
THAT OF JOHN E
I'LL THINK ALL THIS OVER AND WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
THE BEST IS NONE TOO GOOD FOR THE FRIENDS OF MR FORBES YOU KNOW
YES YOUR SPY
THE OFFICE OF SHERIFF WOULD PAY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND A YEAR AND THIS SUM HOPKINS AGREED TO PAY THE LIVERYMAN AND SO RELIEVE HIM OF ALL THE ANNOYANCE OF EARNING IT
THAT IS ALL I BELIEVE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ELIZA ASKED KENNETH WHEN THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD RETIRED
WHY NOT SIR WELL KENNETH WE HAVE TO RESIDE AT ELMHURST WHICH IS HOPKINS'S DISTRICT
I'VE NO TIME FOR POLITICS BUT WE'VE GOT TO WAKE UP JIM WE DEMOCRATS OR THEY'LL GIVE US A RUN FOR OUR MONEY OH THIS IS A REPUBLICAN DISTRICT SIR
NEVERTHELESS I SHOULD LIKE TO SAVE HIM SAID KENNETH
THAT'S THE STORY OF LUCY ROGERS
KENNETH WAITED UNTIL IT HAD SUBSIDED
A FULL VOTE WAS POLLED AND BY SUNDOWN THE FATE OF THE CANDIDATES HAD BEEN DECIDED
STOP AND THINK FOR A MOMENT
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING MATTERS PRETTY CLOSELY AND I'VE CHANGED MY MIND
DON'T WORRY ANY MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SO FORCIBLY AND WELL
THE CRIMINAL ACT IS THEIR FALSE REGISTRATION SO FAR SAID THE DETECTIVE BLANDLY
YES SIR
I HAVE NO IDEA OF ANYTHING THAT DATES BEYOND THAT MORNING REPLIED ELIZA
LUCY SHE CALLED
THAT IS WHY I ASKED YOU TO TELL ME WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND HOW YOU CAME HERE AH YOU THINK I'M MAD DO YOU ASKED THE GIRL WITH A QUIZZICAL SMILE
I DON'T MIND SPENDING MONEY PATSY HE SAID BUT I DON'T APPROVE OF BUYING VOTES AND I WON'T ALLOW IT EITHER TUT-TUT
THE MAJOR'S AN OLD CROAKER BUT HE'D GO TOO IF IT WERE NOT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO STAY IN NEW YORK AND ATTEND TO BUSINESS
I'VE GOT THE OTHER CLERKS ALL FIXED AND THEY'LL STAND BY US
AFTER HE WAS GONE KENNETH RESUMED HIS SPEECH AND CREATED MORE ENTHUSIASM
IT'S MOSTLY A RURAL DISTRICT
SO KENNETH AGREED TO REPAINT THE ENTIRE BARN FOR HIM AND ACTUALLY HAD THE WORK DONE
THERE'S NO PENALTY UNLESS WE'RE FOUND OUT AND THERE AIN'T THE GHOST OF A CHANCE OF THAT
ELIZA AND I ARE GOING TO MY ROOM
HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY CHARMED WITH THE MANAGER'S BRIEF REPLY
HIS CHUBBY FACE WAS FOR ONCE DESTITUTE OF A SMILE
THEN BETH TOOK OUT HER PURSE
YOU'RE GOING ON THEN YES I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID PATSY PROMPTLY
AND THEN SHE WENT TO HER OWN APARTMENT GREATLY PUZZLED AT A RESEMBLANCE SO STRONG THAT IT HAD EVEN DECEIVED LUCY ROGERS'S OWN SWEETHEART
THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE THEN
HE'S NO POLITICIAN AT ALL--JUST AN ARISTOCRAT DECLARED LATHAM A DAPPER LITTLE MAN WITH HIS HAIR SLICKED DOWN TO HIS EARS AND A WAXED MOUSTACHE
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE OLD MARTHA HAS OUR ROOMS AIRED AND IT'S A LONG VISIT TOO ADDED UNCLE JOHN AS YOU'LL BELIEVE WHEN YOU SEE THE PILE OF BAGGAGE
MR BURKE IS A GOOD MAN MY DEAR AND MEANS WELL BY YOU SHE SAID IN HER SWEET SYMPATHETIC TONES
WILL TOLD YOU DIDN'T HE YES OF COURSE
THE OLD LAWYER KNEW NEARLY EVERYONE IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD LIVED HERE ALL HIS LIFE
HE TURNED AROUND TO THE EXPECTANT GROUP AND BETH KNEW FROM THE SPARKLE IN HIS EYES WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WHAT DO THE BOYS SAY FOLKS DON'T SAY MUCH TO ME RAST
OH HERE IT IS
IT'S LUCY--I'M SURE IT'S LUCY
DRAW UP A CONTRACT AND I'LL SIGN IT
WI THE SAME HIGH SPIRITS MY NELL HAD AFORE SHE BROKE DOWN
SHOULD HE NOT ADVERTISE THIS MUTUAL-BENEFIT COMMODITY WHEREVER HE PLEASED AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE FARMERS
IS SHE TALL MIDDLIN MISS LIGHT OR DARK HEH IS HER HAIR LIGHT OR DARK COLORED MIDDLIN
THE ARGUMENTS OF OUR DISTINGUISHED REPRESENTATIVE ARE WELL WORTHY OF YOUR CONSIDERATION HE BEGAN QUIETLY
HER NATURE WAS SO SUSCEPTIBLE SO VERY SENSITIVE THAT WHEN SHE DISCOVERED TOM GATES WHOM SHE LOVED TO BE GUILTY OF A FORGERY SHE WORRIED HERSELF INTO AN ATTACK OF BRAIN-FEVER
I WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED THE POVERTY
YOU WOULDN'T CATCH RAST HOPKINS DOING SUCH A FOOL STUNT
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HER SINCE THAT'S TOO BAD REMARKED ELIZA PARSONS BUTTERING HER BREAD
I AM POSITIVE WAS THE ANSWER
THE YOUNG FOOL HAD NO BUSINESS TO MONKEY WITH POLITICS HE ADDED AND THIS WILL TEACH HIM TO KEEP HIS FINGERS OUT OF SOMEONE ELSE'S PIE IT ISN'T MR HOPKINS'S PIE DECLARED PATSY STOUTLY
SO AN ARRANGEMENT WAS MADE THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN WITH HIS YOUNG FRIEND INDEFINITELY AND STRIVE TO TEACH HIM SUCH ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS AS WOULD ENABLE HIM IN TIME TO ATTEND TO HIS EXTENSIVE INTERESTS UNDERSTANDINGLY AND WISELY
WILL YOU LEAVE US ALONE PLEASE MR MARKHAM SURE-LY MR FORBES
AND AS WE'VE NOT BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED I REALLY DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD KNOW YOU SHE ADDED WITH A LIGHT LAUGH
IN FACT TOM GATES ON SOBER REFLECTION KNEW THAT THE GIRL COULD NOT BE LUCY YET HE COULD NOT STILL THE YEARNING IN HIS HEART WHENEVER HE SAW HER
WE HAVE COME TO ASK IF YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING OF YOUR DAUGHTER NOT A WORD AS YET MISS DEGRAF WILL IS OUT WITH THE HORSE AND BUGGY DOING HIS BEST TO GET INFORMATION
BUT HE'S UNDER HOPKINS'S THUMB AND DOESN'T DARE DEFY HIM DOESN'T HE LIKE MR HOPKINS ASKED PATSY IN SURPRISE
MARSHALL'S ALL RIGHT
MEANTIME LOUISE AND MR WATSON WERE HAVING SOME INTERESTING INTERVIEWS WITH THE FARMERS WIVES ALONG THE MARVILLE ROAD
ELECTION'S ABOUT OVER AND YOU WON'T NEED HER ANY LONGER WILL YOU SIR DO YOU MEAN TO INSULT ME ASKED THE HONORABLE ERASTUS INDIGNANTLY
LET'S SEE THAT'S A GAIN OF SEVENTY-FOUR VOTES MY DEARS HOORAY CRIED PATSY DELIGHTEDLY
THIS VISITOR IS MR FORBES OF ELMHURST AN THE YOUNG LADY IS MISS DEGRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
HE KNOWS THE GAME AND FORBES DON'T CAN'T HE LEARN ASKED THE GIRL
AS THE TWO MEN ANGRILY FACED EACH OTHER THEY COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GENTLE WORDS TO SAY AND DR SQUIERS BECAME SO EXCITED BY THE OTHER'S REPROACHES THAT HE INDULGED IN CARELESS GESTURES
ARE YOU GLAD TO SEE US BOY
IT LEFT A BROAD SCAR ON HER LEFT FOREARM WHICH SHE WILL BEAR AS LONG AS SHE LIVES IT IS WELL TO KNOW THAT SAID MR BURKE
IN ORDER TO MAKE GOOD THE LOSS OF THE RING A VALUABLE DIAMOND--I--I GOT INTO TROUBLE AND LUCY WAS SO SHOCKED AND DISTRESSED THAT SHE--SHE LOST HER HEAD--BECAME MAD YOU KNOW--AND LEFT HOME DURING THE NIGHT WITHOUT A WORD TO ANY ONE
THAT WOULD TAKE HIM AWAY FROM THE PLACE AND GIVE HIM A CHANGE OF SCENE PATSY SHOOK HER HEAD
BY AND BYE I CAME TO A TOWN
WILL YOU ASSIST ME ASKED THE PHYSICIAN
THEY HAVE MERELY GONE TO WORK IN A BUSINESS-LIKE MANNER AND USED THEIR WITS AND COMMON-SENSE IN EDUCATING THE VOTERS
YOU MAY THANK MR FORBES FOR WARNING YOU IN TIME
THE SOUND MADE BETH INDIGNANT AND SHE HURRIED BACK TO WHERE HER COUSINS WERE BUSY WITH THE LAUGHING CHATTERING THRONG OF VISITORS
OH KEN SHE CRIED DID YOU SEE
I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND ELIZA
MARTHA WAS OLD AND SOMEWHAT FEEBLE IN BODY BUT HER MIND WAS STILL ACTIVE AND HER LONG YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN DIRECTING THE HOUSEHOLD AT ELMHURST MADE HER A VERY USEFUL AND IMPORTANT PERSONAGE
SO MANY FULLY THAT MANY SAID MR WATSON SMILING
COME IN MISS SO KENNETH AND BETH ENTERED AT THE HALF-OPEN PORCH DOOR AND ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM
PERHAPS NOT AGREED LOUISE
I--I'M SURE I WAS MISTAKEN BETH SIGHED
IT'S MR BURKE ISN'T IT THE MAN NODDED AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW
PERHAPS THIRTY OR FORTY AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL VOTE OF THE DISTRICT THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED PATSY GASPED
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO TOM HE ASKED
TAINT MUCH OF A PLACE--NELL SAYS I'VE ALWAYS BIN A SHIF'LES LOT AN I GUESS IT'S TRUE
IF ANYTHING AT ALL WOULD MAKE ME TAKE NOTICE IT'S YOUR OWN PRETTY PHIZ MAJOR REMARKED UNCLE JOHN HELPING HIMSELF TO WAFFLES FROM A FRESH PLATE NORA BROUGHT IN YOU IRISH ARE SUCH CONFIRMED FLATTERERS THAT YOU FLATTER YOUR OWN DAUGHTERS
YESTERDAY YOUR HIRED MEN PAINTED ALL THE FRONT O MY FENCE--PAINTED IT WHITE--NOT ONLY WHERE TH SIGNS WAS BUT TH WHOLE LENGTH OF IT
THE DENTIST WAS SILENT
I DON'T CARE A RAP NOW WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER UNCLE JOHN'S VISIT ERASTUS STORMED OVER TO SQUIERS'S OFFICE AND FOUND HIS ACCOMPLICE BOILING WITH INDIGNATION AT HAVING BEEN TRAPPED IN A CRIMINAL UNDERTAKING
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF YOU SHE DECLARED POSITIVELY AND RESUMED HER EATING
WE LIVED IN BALTIMORE
AND I AND I REPEATED PATSY AND LOUISE
AND IT CAME UPON HIM LIKE THUNDER OUT OF A CLEAR SKY
I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED THE GIRL
WASHINGTON COUNTY WAS NOT SO BAD
IF WE GET MR SIMMONS ON OUR SIDE I BELIEVE WE'LL BE SURE TO DEFEAT HOPKINS OH I'LL DO WHAT I KIN WAS THE READY PROMISE AND AFTER A FEW MORE REMARKS ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND THE NEATNESS OF THE HOUSE LOUISE TOOK HER LEAVE
TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE SOUNDS MATURE BUT THE OWNER OF ELMHURST WAS AS BOYISH AND INEXPERIENCED AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE TWENTY-ONE YEARS OLD TO BE
THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS TO REPORT OUR MOVEMENTS TO MR HOPKINS AND THERE'S NO GREAT HARM IN THAT SO THE MATTER WAS LEFT FOR THE TIME
KENNETH ISN'T A COWARD SHE SAID
ARISTOCRATIC SNOBBERY
L AND THE WORDS
HULLO JIM GOOD MORNING MR HOPKINS
THAT IS EASY AS FAR AS TALKING IS CONCERNED SHE SAID
I--I'VE BEEN WITHOUT SLEEP FOR SO LONG THAT I HAVEN'T ANY NERVES LEFT THEN YOU MUST GO TO SLEEP NOW AND GET A GOOD REST HE TURNED TO BETH
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS PULLED WAS THE HONORABLE ERASTUS'S LEG CHAPTER XX PRICKING A BUBBLE
SMOKIN LL KILL ME SURE AN THERE'S A FAINT HOPE O LIVIN THROUGH THIS STRUGGLE TO GIVE IT UP
THIS THING AIN'T OVER YET THE DAY PASSED VERY QUIETLY AND WITHOUT ANY ESPECIAL INCIDENT
WE'RE HAVING A BIG FIGHT ON OUR HANDS I CAN TELL YOU TELL ME MORE SAID MR HOPKINS TAKING A CHAIR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AT FINDING ONE FAITHFUL FRIEND
I'VE GOT THE ORDER FOR THESE SIGNS IN MY POCKET AND I'LL HAVE EM PAINTED ALL OVER THE DISTRICT IN A WEEK
I GOT ALL THE CLERKS FIXED
I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN ME BEFORE ASKED THE YOUTH ASTONISHED
THAT THE FIGHT IS NOT AGAINST ADVERTISING BUT FOR BEAUTIFUL RURAL HOMES AND SCENES OH I'LL FIX THAT MISS DOYLE
HER FORM AND FACE ARE IDENTICAL WITH LUCY'S
BUT I DIDN'T LOSE ANY
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL IT'S WICKED TO HOPE SHE IS ALIVE
KENNETH HAS GONE INTO POLITICS MORE POWER TO HIS ELBOW EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR
YOU SACRIFICED ME WHEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHERIFF YOU'RE WELL PAID FOR THAT DOC AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO PUT MY NECK IN A NOOSE FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE
OF COURSE MISS
OF COURSE MISS
ANGER GAVE WAY TO SUDDEN FEAR AND HE SCRUTINIZED THE AVERTED COUNTENANCE OF THOMPSON CAREFULLY
DR HOYT DRANK A CUP AND THEN STEPPED OUT UPON THE LITTLE PORCH TAKING A POSITION OF OBSERVATION BY THE WINDOW
IT'LL BE A FIGHT AND A HARD ONE FOR HOPKINS WON'T GIVE UP HIS JOB IF HE CAN HELP IT THE BOY BRIGHTENED AGAIN
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RAST'S CHANCES SHE ASKED PRESENTLY AS SHE THREADED NEW COTTON INTO HER NEEDLE
I REMEMBERED BOOKS I MUST HAVE READ
WE MAY REQUIRE YOU TO MAKE A FEW SPEECHES BUT ALL THE DETAILS WILL BE ARRANGED FOR YOU DO YOU INTEND TO PERMIT THIS UNCLE JOHN ASKED KENNETH
THE FAULT WAS NOT HIS
DR HOYT'S FIRST SUGGESTION HAD BEEN BEST
IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HER THEY WOULDN'T DARE ARREST HER ON SUSPICION THE SQUIERSES WOULD DARE DO ANYTHING
NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED LOUISE
RAST'S A PRETTY SLICK ONE HE IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY SETTIN THAT LIZA TO WATCH EM AND TELL ALL THEY DOES
YOU WIN THE FIGHT KEN AND I'LL GUARANTEE YOU'LL OUTCLASS THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FELLOW REPRESENTATIVES
SO EVERY MAN WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE WILL PLEASE ME BEST BY VOTING FOR KENNETH FORBES THERE WAS A CHEER AT THIS AND WHEN IT SUBSIDED THE MANAGER CONTINUED
SHE HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN POLITICS AND RESENTED THE INTRUSION OF THE MANY WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE TO SEE AND CONSULT WITH HER HUSBAND DURING THE TIRESOME POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
HE DECIDED TO CALL A MEETING OF THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AT THE DISTRICT SCHOOL-HOUSE ON SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE KENNETH COULD ADDRESS THEM WITH LOGICAL ARGUMENTS AND ENDEAVOR TO WIN THEM OVER TO HIS WAY OF THINKING
AT--AT THE WAY HE COME IT OVER THE GALS UP AT ELMHURST
THE BOY LOOKED AT HIM EAGERLY
NOT IN A THOUSAND YEARS MEANTIME BETH WAS PRESSING KENNETH'S ARM AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM AND SAYING HAPPILY
HER MOTHER WAS UNCLE JOHN'S SISTER BUT AS SELFISH AND COLD AS UNCLE JOHN WAS GENEROUS AND GENIAL
HE SAW HER IN THE DIM LIGHT OF A CORRIDOR AND THE RESEMBLANCE CONFUSED HIM I'VE SEEN HER SINCE REMARKED TOM AND THE LIKENESS IS REALLY BEWILDERING
SO HE WENT BACK TO DR SQUIERS'S HOUSE AND BORROWED THE DOCTOR'S HORSE AND BUGGY
HE MODESTLY ASSURED THEM THAT A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH GOOD FOR HIS DISTRICT IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO
I WILL NOT DENY HIS STATEMENT THAT THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THREE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN PAID THE FARMERS OF THIS DISTRICT BY ADVERTISERS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
HIS SUNKEN CHEEKS WERE COVERED WITH STUBBY GRAY WHISKERS HIS SHOULDERS WERE STOOPED AND BENT FROM HARD WORK AND HIS HANDS BORE EVIDENCES OF A LIFE OF TOIL
FROM THIS TIME ON I'M GOING TO BE YOUR FRIEND YOU KNOW AND KEEP ALL YOUR SECRETS
SHE NEVER ASKED A MAN WHICH SIDE HE FAVORED BUT TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT MR FORBES
WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY
IT--IT WOULDN'T INTEREST YOU A BIT WHY NOT ASKED LOUISE SOFTLY
MY FATHER WAS A HARD MAN AND DEMANDED THAT I MARRY THE MAN HE HAD HIMSELF CHOSEN
SHE LAUGHED NATURALLY AND WAS TOO LIGHT-HEARTED AND GAY TO HARBOR A CARE OF ANY SORT IN HER FRIVOLOUS MIND
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO SUPPORT MR FORBES IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF HE'S ELECTED I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE HUNDRED EXTRA DO YOU MEAN THAT SIR ASKED THE EDITOR SCARCELY ABLE TO BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EARS
IT SEEMED QUEER THAT THE PRECINCTS FURTHEST AWAY SHOULD BE FIRST TO RESPOND BUT SO IT WAS
WE'RE HERE TO BRACE UP AND GET TO WORK AND TO WIN ADDED BETH QUIETLY
OLD WILL TREMBLED WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND WAS SO FLUSTERED BY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EXPERIMENT THAT DR HOYT DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A QUIETING POTION
DID YOU KNOW HER BEFORE THAT MRS HOPKINS WHY I DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW HER BUT I SEEN HER WORKIN AROUND MISS SQUIERS'S PLACE MANY A TIME AND SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO MOUNT TO MUCH EVEN THEN
I TOLD RAST NOT TO FOOL WITH HER OR SHE'D MAKE HIM TROUBLE DID YOU NOW EXCLAIMED THE MAN WONDERINGLY
ONE DAY OL MIS SQUIERS THE DOC'S MOTHER MISSED A DI'MON RING
I DON'T SAY WILL HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN TENDER AND TRUE TO ME AND ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED TO LUCY
LOUISE ANSWERED THAT SHE AND ELIZA PARSONS HAD BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
TO OFFSET THIS MR HOPKINS WORE A SILK HAT AND A PRINCE ALBERT COAT MORNING NOON AND NIGHT
GIRLS DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE RAST
ONE IS TO TELEGRAPH AT ONCE FOR A SPECIALIST
THEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO AFTER OBTAINING MY PROMISE TO MARRY HIM FOUND SOME ONE HE LOVED BETTER AND CARELESSLY DISCARDED ME
GOIN BACK ON ME EH I'M A REPUBLICATION RAST SO YOU ARE SAID MR HOPKINS SLOWLY HIS TEMPER AT WHITE HEAT AND THAT MORTGAGE IS TWO MONTHS OVERDUE GO OVER TO THE BANK AND GET YOUR MONEY THEN
THEN UNCLE JOHN ROSE SLOWLY AND TOOK THE BOY'S HAND
UNCLE JOHN AND I WILL DRIVE OVER TO THE VILLAGE SHE SAID AND PERHAPS WE'LL BE GONE ALL DAY
I'D NEVER LOOKED AT IT THAT WAY BEFORE NOW SEE HERE MR BRIGGS
YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A STOP TO THESE THINGS
HIS NOMINATION WAS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WENT HOME THE UNANIMOUS CHOICE OF HIS PARTY BECAUSE NONE OF THE OLDER AND MORE DISCREET POLITICIANS VENTURED TO RISK DEFEAT
BUT HE SAID SHE WAS CLEVER AND SHE IS IF PERTNESS AND A READY TONGUE COUNTS FOR CLEVERNESS
HE HAD A BIG DIAMOND SHIRT-STUD AND UPON HIS PUFFY FINGERS SEVERAL RINGS
HE WAS NOT YET THOROUGHLY RESTED BUT NIGHT WAS APPROACHING AND HE REFLECTED THAT HE COULD OBTAIN ALL THE SLEEP THAT HE NEEDED THEN
MR HOPKINS HAS ADVOCATED ADVERTISING SIGNS ON THE GROUND THAT YOUR FINANCIAL GAIN WARRANTS PERMITTING THEM TO BE PLACED UPON YOUR PREMISES
FINALLY HE SAID
GIRLS ALL WELL I HOPE THERE WAS A BOISTEROUS LAUGH AT THIS SALLY AND MR HOPKINS SMILED AND ENTERED THE OPERA HOUSE WHILE KENNETH FOLLOWED WITH THE FEELING THAT HE WOULD TAKE GREAT DELIGHT IN PUNCHING THE HONORABLE ERASTUS'S NOSE AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
FORBES UNTIL THE HONORABLE ERASTUS BECAME SO FURIOUS THAT HE LEFT THE MEETING IN DISGUST
OR IF YOU DO NEVER TRY TO QUIT
THEY WOULDN'T YOU KNOW
MR MERRICK GOT THE HEAD OF THE CONCERN IN CLEVELAND OVER THE TELEPHONE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR
I WISH SAID BETH SLOWLY I KNEW YOU A SUDDEN WAVE OF SCARLET SWEPT OVER ELIZA'S FACE
AREN'T YOU LUCY ROGERS THE MAID RAISED HER EYEBROWS WITH A GESTURE OF GENUINE SURPRISE
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE I'M NOT A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON AT ELMHURST REPLIED ELIZA IN A PLEASANT EVEN TONE
BUT NOW I AM HELPLESS AND MY HUSBAND DEVOTES ALL HIS TIME TO ME ALTHOUGH I BEG HIM TO WORK THE FARM AND TRY TO EARN SOME MONEY
THEY WERE PAINTED ON THE FENCES AND BARNS AS HE PASSED ALONG
IT'S AN IMPORTANT OFFICE PROPERLY FILLED
I OBTAINED THE SITUATION ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO
BUT THAT MAN WITH A SHUDDER TRIED TO TRAP ME
YES WAS THE QUIET REPLY
THEN YOU MUST SHOW IT BY BEING A MAN AND NOT BY GIVING WAY TO YOUR TROUBLE IN THIS FOOLISH MANNER I'LL TRY SIR NOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR THERE'S A GOOD DEAL TO HOPE FOR
CAN YOU TELL ME KENNETH ASKED WHO OWNS THIS PROPERTY WHY I DO REPLIED THE MAN REINING UP
REYNOLDS SAW THE POLITICAL NECESSITY OF THIS SACRIFICE AND CONSENTED READILY TO THE ARRANGEMENT
IN THE EVENING THE DOCTOR MADE THE JOURNEY A SECOND TIME ACCOMPANYING THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LUCY WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY A MAID LOUISE HAD SENT WITH HER
FORBES OUGHTER BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF TO SEND A BUNCH O GIRLS OUT ELECTIONEERIN I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IRREGULAR THING
PERHAPS FOR ELECTION PURPOSES SOMETHING A LITTLE CHEAPER OH NO
REALIZING THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE CONDITION WOULD NOT WIN VOTES MR HOPKINS REMAINED AT HOME ALL DAY AND NAGGED HIS LONG-SUFFERING SPOUSE WHOSE TONGUE WAS HER ONLY DEFENCE
ALL RIGHT NELL MUTTERED OLD WILL HIS KNEES KNOCKING TOGETHER IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS KEN I'LL FRANKLY SAY THE THING CAN'T BE DONE
AND UNCLE JOHN WAS RIGHT
AS NEARLY AS WE CAN FIGURE FROM OUR RECENT CANVASS SAID MR CUNNINGHAM THE CHAIRMAN WE ARE FAST LOSING GROUND AND OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE SMALLER THAN IF NO INTEREST IN THE ELECTION HAD BEEN AROUSED
BETTER YET
I WON'T DO IT RAST AND THAT'S A FACT MR HOPKINS COUGHED
PATSY HAD CHARGE OF THE TOWNS AND LOUISE OF THE COUNTRY DISTRICTS BUT BETH OFTEN AIDED LOUISE WHO HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TERRITORY TO COVER
YOUNG FELLER NAMED FORBES--A BOY SIR--WITH NO NOTION ABOUT THE GAME AT ALL
HERE'S VISITORS TOM THANK YOU MR MARKHAM REPLIED A QUIET VOICE AS A YOUNG MAN CAME FORWARD FROM THE DIM INTERIOR OF THE CELL
HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT IN JOINT DEBATE THE GIRLS ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AT ONCE
HERE AT ELMHURST ASKED THE ASTONISHED KENNETH
HE DOESN'T SUSPECT THAT AN ARMY OF INVASION IS COMING DADDY CRIED PATSY YOU HUSH UP
AS IT IS OUR YOUNG FRIEND CANNOT AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS QUIXOTIC ACTION HE DOESN'T WISH TO AVOID THEM WAS THE QUIET REPLY
GO ON SAID BETH ENCOURAGINGLY FOR OLD WILL HAD SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT AND SEEMED UNABLE TO PROCEED
ALL YOUR YOUNG LIFE YOU'VE BEEN TOO SELF-CONTAINED AND EXCLUSIVE IN YOUR HABITS
ON THE FARM NEAREST TO ELMHURST AT THE NORTH WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED WEBB WAS A BARN FACING THE ROAD THAT DISPLAYED ON ITS SIDE A TOBACCO SIGN
I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL
SHE ISN'T AT ALL THAT STYLE OF A GIRL MISS SHE MAY BE ACTING SUGGESTED BETH
SO THERE WAS NO NEED OF AN INTRODUCTION AND MR WARREN WAS DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH THIS FAMOUS PERSONAGE
VERY WELL SAID HE
AS IT TOOK MANY COATS OF PAINT TO BLOT OUT THE SIGN IT WAS RATHER A EXPENSIVE OPERATION
BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL MISS MERRICK NOT TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND TAKE THE DOSE YOURSELF LOUISE LAUGHED
IF YOU CAN SHIRK YOUR DUTIES WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE I'VE NOTHING TO SAY FOR A TIME THE YOUNG MAN WAS SILENT
GO ON LUCY HAD A SCHOOLIN AN WE WORKED HARD TO GIVE IT HER FER MY LAND AIN'T MUCH ACCOUNT NOHOW
BECOMING A MILLIONAIRE AGAINST HIS WILL AS HE DECLARED HE HAD LEARNED TO KNOW HIS NIECES LATE IN LIFE AND FOUND IN THEIR SOCIETY SO MUCH TO ENJOY THAT HE WAS NOW WHOLLY DEVOTED TO THEIR INTERESTS
WE'LL WIN OUT IN A CANTER
AND AN IMPORTANT GAME
IT'S NEVER WON UNTIL THE LAST CARD IS PLAYED
CHAPTER XIX PATSY INDULGES IN EAVESDROPPING MISS PATRICIA DOYLE AWAKENED AT DAYBREAK NEXT MORNING WITH A THROBBING TOOTHACHE
BUT SHE WAS WINNING FROM THE TOP OF HER RED HAIR TO THE TIPS OF HER TOES AND SO ABSOLUTELY UNAFFECTED THAT SHE WON ALL HEARTS
IF IT'S A QUESTION OF WITS HER SEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF US WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE MISS ASKED THE DETECTIVE TURNING TO LOUISE
THESE SIXTY-SIX MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTED BY YOU AND ARE NOW WORKING AT THIS MILL THIS IS ALL NONSENSE PROTESTED THE MANAGER GROWING PALE
THAT'S HOW ALL THE TROUBLE CAME ABOUT HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
BUT IT SEEMS SHE ARRIVED AT ELMHURST ONLY A DAY OR TWO AFTER LUCY DISAPPEARED FROM HOME
BUT ELIZA BORE THE SCRUTINY WITH QUIET UNCONCERN
CHEER UP GIRLS
AND THERE WERE PATSY DOYLE BETH DEGRAF AND LOUISE MERRICK A BEVY OF DAINTY AND SPRIGHTLY GIRLS ALIGHTING EAGERLY FROM THE COACHES WITH UNCLE JOHN HANDING OUT THE GRIPS AND PACKAGES AND GIVING THE CHECKS FOR THE BAGGAGE WITH BUSINESS-LIKE CELERITY TO THOMAS THE GROOM
KENNETH BEING A MAN OF ARTISTIC INSTINCTS AND LOVING COUNTRY SCENES RESENTED THIS INVASION OF COMMERCIALISM AND TRIED TO FIGHT IT AND SO RAN MY HEAD AGAINST A STONE WALL ADDED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A BITTER LAUGH
PLEASE ASK THE MEN TO ASSEMBLE IN THE YARD BEFORE THEY GO HOME
AND TO PUT YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU BELONG DECLARED LOUISE
LUCY COULDN'T BE SO--SO AIRY SO HEARTLESS
THE MAJOR MANAGED JOHN MERRICK'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS LEAVING THE OLD MILLIONAIRE FREE TO DO AS HE PLEASED
I SUPPOSE HE PAYS HER FOR WHAT SHE TELLS HIM ABOUT FORBES BUT HE'D BETTER SAVE HIS MONEY AND FIGHT ON THE SQUARE
IT WAS A JOLLY PARTY THAT ASSEMBLED AT THE DINNER-TABLE IN ELMHURST THAT EVENING
WELL I DON'T OBJECT
POLITICIANS SOMETIMES MAKE MISTAKES

IT'S BECAUSE I'M ONLY A GIRL AND HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME REPLIED LOUISE SWEETLY
THIS WAS A STARTLING SURPRISE AND THE NEXT ADVICE FROM A COUNTRY PRECINCT IN WASHINGTON COUNTY SHOWED ANOTHER GAIN OF TWELVE FOR HOPKINS
YOU DON'T OFTEN GET OUT MA'AM
THEY ALL FOLLOWED KENNETH INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE BUTLER HAD JUST LIGHTED THE LAMPS
NOT AT PRESENT
YOU WON'T NEED TO HUMILIATE YOURSELVES MY DEARS
I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED KENNETH
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PAPER IS DEMOCRATIC MR BRIGGS THAT'S A MISTAKE SIR REPLIED THE EDITOR EVASIVELY
IT LOOKS SAID KENNETH QUIETLY LIKE A LANDSLIDE FOR HOPKINS AND I WONDER HOW OUR COMMITTEE WAS SO BADLY INFORMED YOU SEE SAID UNCLE JOHN VOTERS WON'T USUALLY TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW THEY'VE DECIDED TO VOTE
THE THIN FINGERS CLASPED AND UNCLASPED IN LITTLE SPASMODIC JERKS AND BELIED THE QUIET SMILE UPON THE FACE ABOVE THEM
PLEASE LOOK AT THE MATTER FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT
BE SENSIBLE MARY AND TELL ME WHO THESE GIRLS ARE
SHE TRIED A COLD COMPRESS AND IT JUMPED WITH RENEWED ACTIVITY

SHE IS RATHER FLIGHTY AND IRRESPONSIBLE SIR AND I WAS SORRY FOR THE POOR GIRL
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH ANSWERED THE DENTIST MORE CALMLY
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BE BEATEN AND THAT'S WHAT'S TROUBLING HIM UNCLE JOHN PUSHED BACK HIS CHAIR
BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE
YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAP ME SHE PANTED
BUT PATSY'S WISE LITTLE HEAD COUNSELLED CAUTION IN HANDLING THE MATTER
THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY
A DEFEAT WON'T HURT US MUCH FOR WE'VE ALL MADE A GOOD FIGHT
AND THAT MEANS A BIG LAUGH ON FORBES AND THE GOOD WILL OF THE FARMERS WHO SELL THEIR SPACES AND NOT A CENT OUT OF MY POCKET
HE LOOKED BACK AND SEEING MR HOPKINS'S SCOWLING FACE AT THE WINDOW RETURNED A PLEASANT SMILE AS HE DROVE AWAY
MANAGERS OF WORTHY CHARITIES WERE FAMILIAR WITH JOHN MERRICK'S SIGNATURE ON CHECKS AND YET THE VAST FORTUNE GREW WITH LEAPS AND BOUNDS
IT'S A TRICK THE BOARDING-SCHOOL MISSES WON'T UNDERSTAND UNTIL AFTER THEY'VE CUT THEIR EYE-TEETH IN POLITICS THERE'S A PRETTY HEAVY PENALTY AGAINST FALSE REGISTRATION OBSERVED THE DENTIST GLOOMILY
