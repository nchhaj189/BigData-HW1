THE TRUTH IS I HAD NOT THAT LONGING TO ASK A MOTHER-IN-LAW'S BLESSING WHICH YOU SAY YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD FOR I KNEW MINE TOO WELL TO THINK SHE COULD MAKE A GOOD ONE
BUT WE ARE ALL MORTAL
BUT LAST NIGHT MY BROTHER TOLD ME HE DID NOT SEND HIS TILL TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING AND NOW HE CALLS FOR MINE AT SEVEN BEFORE I AM UP
IF YOUR FELLOW-SERVANT HAS BEEN WITH YOU SHE HAS TOLD YOU I PART WITH HER BUT FOR HER ADVANTAGE
WHAT A STRANGE FELLOW THIS GOLDSMITH IS HE HAS A HEAD FIT FOR NOTHING BUT HORNS
SURE YOU GO A LITTLE TOO FAR IN YOUR CONDEMNATION ON'T
I HAD A LETTER FROM HER THE OTHER DAY
MY COUSIN TEMPLE SAYS HE TOLD IT TO MAJOR SCOTT AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND SO TIS LIKE YOU KNEW IT BEFORE
BUT I'M AFRAID IT WAS NOT YOURS FOR I SAW IT NO MORE
ONLY LET ME DESIRE YOU NOT TO PITY THE JEALOUS ONE FOR I REMEMBER I COULD DO NOTHING BUT LAUGH AT HIM AS ONE THAT SOUGHT HIS OWN VEXATION
WE ARE GLAD TO FIND HIM AT LARGE AGAIN IN 1653 HIS HEAD SAFE ON HIS SHOULDERS AND DO NOT GRUDGE HIM HIS GRANT OF DUTIES ON SEA-COAL DATED 1660
I HOPE I AM HALF ASLEEP NOTHING ELSE CAN EXCUSE ME
AND MY PRECIOUS UNCLE DOES SO VISIT HER AND IS SO KIND THAT WITHOUT DOUBT SOME MISCHIEF WILL FOLLOW
NOR OF MAKING MY ACTION APPEAR MORE INDISCREET THAN IT IS
BEFORE YOU GO I MUST HAVE A RING FROM YOU TOO A PLAIN GOLD ONE
AND THOUGH HE HAS LEFT IT MORE IN MY POWER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY LEAVES A DAUGHTER YET CERTAINLY I WERE THE WORST NATURED PERSON IN THE WORLD IF HIS KINDNESS WERE NOT A GREATER TIE UPON ME THAN ANY ADVANTAGE HE COULD HAVE RESERVED
IN SHORT WE CAME SO NEAR AN ABSOLUTE FALLING OUT THAT TWAS TIME TO GIVE OVER AND WE SAID SO MUCH THEN THAT WE HAVE HARDLY SPOKEN A WORD TOGETHER SINCE
I EXPECT MY ELDEST BROTHER HERE SHORTLY WHOSE FORTUNE IS WELL MENDED BY MY OTHER BROTHER'S DEATH SO AS IF HE WERE SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH WHAT HE HAS DONE I KNOW NO REASON WHY HE MIGHT NOT BE VERY HAPPY
LADY NEWCASTLE DIED IN 1673 AND WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY,--"A WISE WITTY AND LEARNED LADY WHICH HER MANY BOOKS DO WELL TESTIFY SIR,--I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER TO-DAY WHEN I THOUGHT IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD BE SENSIBLE OF ANYTHING BUT MY FATHER'S SICKNESS AND MY OWN AFFLICTION IN IT
WHEN I DIE I'LL GIVE IT YOU AGAIN
HE APPEARS TO HAVE ACTED AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH AS DOROTHY'S GUARDIAN AND HIS NAME OCCURS MORE THAN ONCE IN THE PAGES OF HER LETTERS
THIS IS BUT AS EXTRAVAGANT AS YOURS FOR IT IS AS LIKELY THAT YOUR MOTHER SHOULD SEND ME LETTERS AS THAT I SHOULD MAKE A JOURNEY TO SEE POOR PEOPLE HANGED OR THAT YOUR TEETH SHOULD DROP OUT AT THIS AGE
I DO NOT KNOW HIM SO MUCH AS TO GIVE YOU MUCH OF HIS CHARACTER
SINCE HE HAS MADE A STORY WITH A NEW MISTRESS THAT IS WORTH YOUR KNOWING BUT TOO LONG FOR A LETTER
WE FIND SIR THOMAS'S DAUGHTER WAS AT THIS TIME THE THIRD WIFE OF LORD MANCHESTER
I AM NOT APT TO HOPE AND WHETHER IT BE THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I KNOW NOT
BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU ATTEMPT IT TILL YOUR FATHER IS READY FOR THE JOURNEY TOO
I CANNOT IMAGINE FOR MY LIFE
IN 1663 THEY WERE LIVING IN ENGLAND
WELL THIS IS A SAD STORY
YOU WILL THINK ME BOUNTIFUL I HOPE WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU THAT I KNOW NO HOUR WHEN YOU HAVE THEM NOT
AND I WHO OF ALL THINGS DO NOT LOVE TO MAKE SECRETS OF TRIFLES TOLD HER I HAD SEEN YOU THAT DAY
AT THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE IS A HIGH PINNACLED BUTTRESS RISING THE FULL HEIGHT OF THE WALL
I HAVE NOW GIVEN MY CONSENT THAT SHE SHALL MARRY A VERY PRETTY LITTLE GENTLEMAN SIR CHRISTOPHER YELVERTON'S SON AND I THINK WE SHALL HAVE A WEDDING ERE IT BE LONG
WE MIGHT DEFY ALL THAT FORTUNE COULD DO AND PUTTING OFF ALL DISGUISE AND CONSTRAINT WITH THAT WHICH ONLY MADE IT NECESSARY MAKE OUR LIVES AS EASY TO US AS THE CONDITION OF THIS WORLD WILL PERMIT
THERE IS A SLIGHT CLUE TO HER CHARACTER IN THE FOLLOWING SCRAP OF LETTER-WRITING STILL PRESERVED AMONG SOME OLD MANUSCRIPT PAPERS OF THE HUTTON FAMILY
TIS NOT HALF A YEAR SINCE SHE WENT I THINK
POOR MAN I AM SORRY FOR YOU
LETTER 43 SIR,--I CAN SAY LITTLE MORE THAN I DID,--I AM CONVINCED OF THE VILENESS OF THE WORLD AND ALL THAT'S IN IT AND THAT I DECEIVED MYSELF EXTREMELY WHEN I EXPECTED ANYTHING OF COMFORT FROM IT
TIS MY MISFORTUNES ONLY THAT HAVE THAT INFECTIOUS QUALITY AS TO STRIKE AT THE SAME TIME ME AND ALL THAT'S DEAR TO ME
OTHERWISE MY WISHES DO NOT SIGNIFY MUCH BUT I AM FORBID COMPLAINTS OR TO EXPRESS MY FEARS
DU RYER A MAGNIFICENT FOLIO PUBLISHED IN 1646
THEREFORE BY ALL OUR FRIENDSHIP I CONJURE YOU AND BY THE POWER YOU HAVE GIVEN ME COMMAND YOU TO PRESERVE YOURSELF WITH THE SAME CARE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME LIVE
MY BROTHER JOHN IS NOT COME DOWN AGAIN NOR AM I CERTAIN WHEN HE WILL BE HERE
YET PRAY ASSURE HER I WOULD NOT SCRUPLE AT UNDERTAKING IT MYSELF TO GAIN SUCH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND WOULD GO MUCH FARTHER THAN WHERE I HOPE SHE NOW IS TO SERVE HER
THE MARQUIS OF HERTFORD WAS THE DUKE OF SOMERSET'S GREAT-GRANDSON
I AM THE MOST UNFORTUNATE WOMAN BREATHING BUT I WAS NEVER FALSE
AND I CANNOT TELL WHETHER HE DOES NOT USE THE SHOP STILL
I PITY YOUR SISTER IN EARNEST
IN 1668 HE WAS REMOVED FROM BRUSSELS TO THE HAGUE WHERE THE SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS WHICH LED TO THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE TOOK PLACE AND THESE HAVE GIVEN HIM AN HONOURABLE PLACE IN HISTORY
IN SOBER EARNEST I KNOW YOU WILL NOT THINK IT A TROUBLE TO LET YOUR BOY DELIVER THESE BOOKS AND THIS ENCLOSED LETTER WHERE IT IS DIRECTED FOR MY LADY WHOM I WOULD THE FAINEST IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THAT YOU MIGHT JUDGE WHETHER I HAD NOT REASON TO SAY SOMEBODY WAS TO BLAME
BESIDES I LOOK FOR MY ELDEST BROTHER AND COUSIN MOLLE HERE SHORTLY AND I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE NOBODY TO ENTERTAIN BUT YOU WHILST YOU ARE HERE
IF THERE BE A GREATER MAY I FEEL IT
AND IF WE WOULD REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT WE HAVE THE WORD OF ONE OF OUR HISTORIANS THAT THERE IS NO LAMP BY WHICH TO STUDY THE HISTORY OF THIS PERIOD THAT GIVES A BRIGHTER AND MORE SEARCHING LIGHT THAN CONTEMPORARY LETTERS
HOW AND WHY HE RAILED AT LOVE AND MARRIAGE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO KNOW
IT IS SOMEWHAT CURIOUS THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN IN ENGLAND DURING THE CIVIL WARS
BY THIS CONFESSION YOU WILL SEE I AM PAST ALL DISGUISE WITH YOU AND THAT YOU HAVE REASON TO BE SATISFIED WITH KNOWING AS MUCH OF MY HEART AS I DO MYSELF
AND MY FATHER'S MAN HAS GOT ONE OF THE MAIDS TO TALK NONSENSE TO TO-NIGHT AND THEY HAVE GOT BETWEEN THEM A BOTTLE OF ALE
TIS TO PRESERVE YOURSELF FROM THE VIOLENCE OF YOUR PASSION
BUT WHAT AN ASS AM I TO THINK YOU CAN BE IDLE ENOUGH AT LONDON TO READ ROMANCE
AND TO FIND MOREOVER THAT HE WILL BE AS ACCEPTABLE TO DOROTHY AS ANY OTHER IF SHE MAY NOT MARRY TEMPLE
BUT WITHAL THAT AS SHE IS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY PERSON HERSELF SO SHE AIMED AT DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS AND WHEN SHE HAD MARRIED MR SMITH BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE SO BOLD AS TO THINK SHE DID IT BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM SHE UNDERTOOK TO CONVINCE THE WORLD THAT WHAT SHE HAD DONE WAS IN MERE PITY TO HIS SUFFERINGS AND THAT SHE COULD NOT GO A STEP LOWER TO MEET ANYBODY THAN THAT LED HER THOUGH WHEN SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE NO EYES ON HER SHE WAS MORE GRACIOUS TO HIM
JUDGED BY THE MORAL STANDARD OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AT LEAST OF AVERAGE HEIGHT
I COULD NOT READ MY OWN CONFESSION SO OFTEN
I HAVE NOT SEEN TWO YOUNG MEN THAT LOOKED AS IF THEY DESERVED BETTER FORTUNES SO MUCH AS THOSE BROTHERS
DOROTHY MAY HAVE DATED HER LETTERS TO ORDINARY FOLK
THIS WOULD THEREFORE SEEM A NATURAL PLACE TO BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER
HE WAS ONE OF A NEW COUNCIL FORMED IN AUGUST AND SENT INTO IRELAND ABOUT THE END OF THAT MONTH
BESIDES THAT WHAT WITH A SPLEENATICK SIDE AND A CHEMICAL HEAD HE IS BUT AN ODD BODY HIMSELF
MISTRESS STANLEY AND MISTRESS WITHERINGTON HAVE LEFT NO TRACE OF THEIR IDENTITY THAT I CAN FIND BUT MISTRESS PHILADELPHIA CAREY IS NOT WHOLLY UNKNOWN
HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE TO LIVE AT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AT SHEEN
CHRISTMAS 1653 V
NO IN EARNEST I WAS NEVER YET SO IN LOVE WITH MY LIFE BUT THAT I COULD HAVE PARTED WITH IT UPON A MUCH LESS OCCASION THAN YOUR DEATH AND TWILL BE NO COMPLIMENT TO YOU TO SAY IT WOULD BE VERY UNEASY TO ME THEN SINCE TIS NOT VERY PLEASANT TO ME NOW
AM NOT I BEHOLDING TO HIM THINK YOU
AND THE OLD KNIGHT IS I BELIEVE SIR ROBERT COOK A BEDFORDSHIRE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM NOTHING IS KNOWN EXCEPT THAT HE WAS KNIGHTED AT AMPTHILL JULY 21ST 1621
I HAVE SPLEEN ENOUGH TO CARRY ME TO EPSOM THIS SUMMER
AND WHAT IS IT THAT HAS DONE IT
JUST NOW I WAS INTERRUPTED TOO AND CALLED AWAY TO ENTERTAIN TWO DUMB GENTLEMEN;--YOU MAY IMAGINE WHETHER I WAS PLEASED TO LEAVE MY WRITING TO YOU FOR THEIR COMPANY;--THEY HAVE MADE SUCH A TEDIOUS VISIT TOO
AS DOROTHY CALLS HER
NO REALLY IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO DESIRE ANYTHING IT SHALL BE ONLY THAT I MAY INJURE NOBODY BUT MYSELF,--I CAN BEAR ANYTHING THAT REFLECTS ONLY UPON ME
BUT GOD SHE ADDS WITH A NOT UNGRACEFUL VANITY RECOMPENSED HIS JUSTICE AND CONSTANCY BY RESTORING HER AS WELL AS BEFORE TEMPLE SHOWED ON THIS OCCASION THE SAME JUSTICE AND CONSTANCY WHICH DID SO MUCH HONOUR TO COLONEL HUTCHINSON
BUT AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS TAKEN THERE NOT FINDING ANSTRUTHER THEY WENT HOME AGAIN FOR THAT NIGHT
LETTER 6._--THE JOURNEY THAT TEMPLE IS ABOUT TO TAKE MAY BE A PROJECTED JOURNEY WITH THE SWEDISH EMBASSY WHICH WAS SOON TO SET OUT
BUT THIS IS NOT ALL
LETTER 17._--LADY NEWCASTLE WAS MARGARET DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE
THE SUN WAS UP AN HOUR BEFORE I WENT TO BED TO-DAY AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE DONE THIS SINCE I CAME HITHER
I SIT THERE SOMETIMES TILL I AM LOST WITH THINKING
THIS LADY IS OF A FREE JOLLY HUMOUR LOVES CARDS AND COMPANY AND IS NEVER MORE PLEASED THAN WHEN SHE SEES A GREAT MANY OTHERS THAT ARE SO TOO
AND SO DO I THOUGH I SHALL MAKE BUT A SHORT STAY FOR ALL MY BUSINESS THERE IS AT AN END WHEN I HAVE SEEN YOU AND TOLD YOU MY STORIES
HALF ON'T WAS ITALIAN WHICH FOR MY LIFE I COULD NOT GUESS AT THOUGH I SPENT MUCH TIME ABOUT IT
HIS MOTHER ELIZABETH DANVERS BEING DOROTHY'S AUNT
BE IT AS YOU PLEASE I AM NOT ENOUGH CONCERNED IN'T TO DISPUTE IT WITH YOU
IT WAS NOT MINE IT SEEMS TO HAVE AN EMPEROR
NOR THE FEAR AND APPREHENSIONS I HAVE FOR YOU
AND YET I KNOW NO REASON I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT BEAUTY IS ANY ARGUMENT TO MAKE YOU LIKE PEOPLE
MR COURTENAY PROCLAIMS THAT HE IS ONE OF DOROTHY OSBORNE'S DEVOTED SERVANTS AND EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT THE PUBLICATION OF HER LETTERS WILL ADD TO THE NUMBER
ALL THIS MAKES NO IMPRESSION ON YOU
AND WHAT HUMOUR TOOK I CANNOT IMAGINE BUT HE MADE VERY FORMAL ADDRESSES TO ME AND ENGAGED HIS MOTHER AND MY BROTHER TO APPEAR IN'T
YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME AS SOON AS WE HAVE DINED
SHE IS SIR JOHN GREENVIL'S SISTER AND HAS ALL HIS GOOD-NATURE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF BEAUTY AND MODESTY AND WIT ENOUGH
WHAT WITH MARRYING AND WHAT WITH DYING THEY ALL LEAVE ME
TIS NOT UNPLEASANT METHINKS TO HEAR HER TALK HOW AT SUCH A TIME SHE WAS SICK AND THE PHYSICIANS TOLD HER SHE WOULD HAVE THE SMALL-POX AND SHOWED HER WHERE THEY WERE COMING OUT UPON HER
TILL THEN I AM HIS HUMBLE SERVANT AND YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND
FOR TO DEAL FREELY WITH YOU I HAVE SOME DEVOTIONS TO PERFORM THEN WHICH MUST NOT BE DISTURBED WITH ANYTHING AND NOTHING IS LIKE TO DO IT AS SO SENSIBLE AN AFFLICTION
WITHOUT ALL THIS HIS FORTUNE THOUGH NEVER SO GREAT WOULD NOT SATISFY ME
A REAL KINDNESS IS SO FAR BEYOND ALL COMPLIMENT THAT IT NEVER APPEARS MORE THAN WHEN THERE IS LEAST OF T'OTHER MINGLED WITH IT
LOVE HOWEVER TRIUMPHED OVER AMBITION AND THE YOUNG LADY APPEARS NEVER TO HAVE REGRETTED HER DECISION
BOTH THE ROMANCES FOUND TRANSLATORS
FIRST HER BROTHER RAISES HIS OBJECTIONS AND THEN HER RELATIONS BEGIN TO GOSSIP
BUT IF HE COULD HAVE MADE ME MISTRESS OF THE WORLD I COULD NOT HAVE HAD HIM
I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL AND THAT I THOUGHT IT AS HANDSOME A LETTER AS I HAD SEEN
TIS BETTER TELLING YOU THAT I WILL SEND MY LETTERS WHERE YOU DIRECT THAT THEY SHALL BE AS LONG ONES AS POSSIBLY MY TIME WILL PERMIT AND WHEN AT ANY TIME YOU MISS OF ONE I GIVE YOU LEAVE TO IMAGINE AS MANY KIND THINGS AS YOU PLEASE AND TO BELIEVE I MEAN THEM ALL TO YOU
SHE HAD BEEN EARLY IN A CORRESPONDENCE WITH LORD LAUDERDALE THAT HAD GIVEN OCCASION TO CENSURE
THESE THINGS CONSIDERED I BELIEVE THIS LETTER WILL BE LONGER THAN ORDINARY,--KINDER I THINK IT CANNOT BE
CHRISTMAS 1653 THIS CHAPTER OF LETTERS IS A SAD NOTE SOUNDING OUT FROM AMONG ITS FELLOWS WITH MOURNFUL CLEARNESS
SO HE INVITED THEM TOO BUT COULD PREVAIL WITH NEITHER
OR HAS ANY ACCIDENT LESSENED HIS POWER
CERTAINLY YOU HAD NOT
NO NOT MY LADY NEWCASTLE WITH ALL HER PHILOSOPHY THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT EXPECT IT FROM ME
SOME BEGGAR AT THE DOOR HAS MADE SO ILL A REPORT OF IRELAND TO THEM THAT THEY PITY ME EXTREMELY BUT YOU ARE PLEASED I HOPE TO HEAR I AM COMING TO YOU
CREATED HIM LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR OF GUERNSEY
AND ANTHONY WOOD MENTIONS HAVING SEEN OTHER THINGS OF HIS AMONG WHICH MAYBE WAS THE ROMANCE THAT DOROTHY HAD HEARD OF BUT WHICH IS LOST TO US
WHAT A CHARACTER OF A YOUNG COUPLE YOU GIVE ME
AND AS BEFORE WE WERE THOUGHT THE KINDEST BROTHER AND SISTER WE ARE CERTAINLY THE MOST COMPLIMENTAL COUPLE IN ENGLAND
AND IT WAS REPROACHED TO ME BY A KINSMAN BUT A LITTLE BEFORE YOU CAME TO ME THAT HE HAD FOLLOWED ME TO HALF A DOZEN SHOPS TO SEE WHEN I WOULD TAKE NOTICE OF HIM AND WAS AT LAST GOING AWAY WITH A BELIEF TWAS NOT I BECAUSE I DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW HIM
WINTER AND SPRING 1652-53 III
IF ALL THOSE EXCELLENCES SHE IS RICH IN CANNOT KEEP WARM A PASSION WITHOUT THE SUNSHINE OF HER EYES WHAT ARE POOR PEOPLE TO EXPECT
ON HER HUSBAND'S DEATH IN 1632 SHE WENT TO LIVE AT THE HAGUE WHERE SHE REMAINED UNTIL THE RESTORATION
HE USED TO BRAG TO ME ALWAYS OF A GREAT ACQUAINTANCE HE HAD THERE WHAT AN ESTEEM MY LADY HAD FOR HIM AND HAD THE VANITY NOT TO CALL IT IMPUDENCE TO TALK SOMETIMES AS IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD ME BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE HAD HER AND WOULD NOT
THE OWNER OF THE LETTERS HAVING COURTEOUSLY EXPRESSED HIS ACQUIESCENCE NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO GIVE TO THE TASK THAT PATIENT CARE THAT IT IS EASY TO GIVE TO A LABOUR OF LOVE
SOME WILL SAY THEY ARE CUNNING ONLY IN THEIR OWN DEFENCE AND THAT THERE IS NO LIVING IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT IT
FOR MY PART I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION AND SHALL DIE IN'T THAT AS THE MORE ONE SEES AND KNOWS A PERSON THAT ONE LIKES ONE HAS STILL THE MORE KINDNESS FOR THEM SO ON THE OTHER SIDE ONE IS BUT THE MORE WEARY OF AND THE MORE AVERSE TO AN UNPLEASANT HUMOUR FOR HAVING IT PERPETUALLY BY ONE
WHY THAT IF THERE WERE NO KINGS NO QUEENS NO LORDS NO LADIES NOR GENTLEMEN NOR GENTLEWOMEN IN THE WORLD TWOULD BE NO LOSS TO GOD ALMIGHTY AT ALL
I AM GLAD YOUR JOURNEY HOLDS BECAUSE I THINK TWILL BE A GOOD DIVERSION FOR YOU THIS SUMMER
I SHALL LOSE MY SHARE IF I DO NOT TAKE THEM AT THEIR FIRST OFFER
THOUGH WHEN THAT WILL BE I CANNOT CERTAINLY SAY FOR MY FATHER HAS SO SMALL A PROPORTION OF HEALTH LEFT HIM SINCE MY MOTHER'S DEATH THAT I AM IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF HIM AND DARE NOT OFTEN MAKE USE OF THE LEAVE HE GIVES ME TO BE FROM HOME LEST HE SHOULD AT SOME TIME WANT SUCH LITTLE SERVICES AS I AM ABLE TO LEND HIM
FOR THOUGH I HAVE A QUARREL TO HIM IT DOES NOT EXTEND SO FAR AS TO WISH HIM ILL
I WILL WRITE EVERY WEEK AND NO MISS OF LETTERS SHALL GIVE US ANY DOUBTS OF ONE ANOTHER
I RISE IN THE MORNING REASONABLY EARLY AND BEFORE I AM READY I GO ROUND THE HOUSE TILL I AM WEARY OF THAT AND THEN INTO THE GARDEN TILL IT GROWS TOO HOT FOR ME
IT IS NOT KIND IN YOU TO DESIRE AN INCREASE OF MY FRIENDSHIP
HEARTRENDING NEWS
LORD WARWICK WAS THE FATHER OF ROBERT LORD RICH AND WE MAY GATHER FROM THIS LETTER THAT AT LADY DEVONSHIRE'S INSTIGATION HE HAD INTERFERED IN A PROPOSED SECOND MARRIAGE BETWEEN HIS SON AND SOME FAIR UNKNOWN
THE ORMONDS HAD INDEED BEEN IN GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF MONEY AND IN AUGUST 1652 LADY ORMOND HAD COME OVER FROM CAEN WHERE THEY WERE THEN LIVING TO ENDEAVOUR TO CLAIM CROMWELL'S PROMISE OF RESERVING TO HER THAT PORTION OF THEIR ESTATE WHICH HAD BEEN HER INHERITANCE
WHO KNOWS WHAT A YEAR MAY PRODUCE
APRIL THE 2ND 1654 SIR,--THERE WAS NEVER ANY LADY MORE SURPRISED THAN I WAS WITH YOUR LAST
AH
AH
AH
AH
I COULD WISH TOO THAT YOU WOULD LAY YOUR COMMANDS ON ME TO FORBEAR FRUIT
I WAS CARRIED YESTERDAY ABROAD TO A DINNER THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR MIRTH BUT IT SEEMS ONE ILL-HUMOURED PERSON IN THE COMPANY IS ENOUGH TO PUT ALL THE REST OUT OF TUNE
HOSKINS THOUGH A PAINTER OF LESS MERIT HAD HAD THE HONOUR OF PAINTING HIS MAJESTY KING CHARLES I HIS QUEEN AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE COURT
AND HAVE CHOSEN TO GO AS FAR AS GRAVESEND BY WATER THOUGH IT BE VERY GLOOMY WEATHER
TO HIM LILLY WAS BOTH MAN-SERVANT AND SECRETARY
AS SOON AS AN APPOINTMENT CAN BE FOUND FOR TEMPLE THEY ARE TO BE MARRIED--THAT IS AS FAR AS ONE CAN GATHER THE STATE OF AFFAIRS BETWEEN THEM
NEITHER I THINK
WHITELOCKE GOING BUT WITHOUT TEMPLE
I AM AFRAID MY SURPRISE AND DISORDER WILL BE MORE THAN EVER
BUT IF HE MAY BE BELIEVED HE IS RESOLVED TO BE A MOST ROMANCE SQUIRE AND GO IN QUEST OF SOME ENCHANTED DAMSEL WHOM IF HE LIKES AS TO HER PERSON FOR FORTUNE IS A THING BELOW HIM),--AND WE DO NOT READ IN HISTORY THAT ANY KNIGHT OR SQUIRE WAS EVER SO DISCOURTEOUS AS TO INQUIRE WHAT PORTIONS THEIR LADIES HAD,--THEN HE COMES WITH THE POWER OF THE COUNTY TO DEMAND HER WHICH FOR THE PRESENT HE MAY DISPOSE OF BEING SHERIFF SO I DO NOT SEE WHO IS ABLE TO RESIST HIM
I KNOW TIS COUNTED SIMPLE BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY
AND PRAY INFORM YOURSELF OF ALL THAT YOUR FATHER WILL DO ON THIS OCCASION THAT YOU MAY TELL IT ME ONLY
YOU WILL LAUGH SURE WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU THAT HEARING THAT MY LORD LISLE WAS TO GO AMBASSADOR INTO SWEDEN I REMEMBER'D YOUR FATHER'S ACQUAINTANCE IN THAT FAMILY WITH AN APPREHENSION THAT HE MIGHT BE IN THE HUMOUR OF SENDING YOU WITH HIM
AND PEOPLE ARE IN PAIN TILL THEY FIND OUT SOME EXTRAVAGANT EXPRESSION TO REPRESENT THE FOLLY ON'T
PARDON MON CHER COEUR ON M'ATTEND
MY FATHER IS REASONABLY WELL BUT KEEPS HIS CHAMBER STILL AND WILL HARDLY I AM AFRAID EVER BE SO PERFECTLY RECOVERED AS TO COME ABROAD AGAIN
YOU ARE SAFE ARRIVED YOU SAY AND PLEASED WITH THE PLACE ALREADY ONLY BECAUSE YOU MEET WITH A LETTER OF MINE THERE
BUT YOU MUST USE THEN TO BEGIN TO WRITE BEFORE YOU RECEIVE MINE AND WHENSOEVER YOU HAVE ANY SPARE TIME ALLOW ME SOME OF IT
ADIEU MON AME
HE WAS AFTERWARDS ONE OF THE INNER COUNCIL OF FOUR IN TEMPLE'S SCHEME OF GOVERNMENT
FOR HE WRITES TO HIS BROTHER IF TO WISH ON EARTH PEACE GOODWILL TOWARDS MEN BE A MALIGNANT NONE IS GREATER THAN YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER THOMAS PEYTON BUT IN SPITE OF THESE PEACEFUL THOUGHTS IN PRISON IN MAY 1648 HE IS HEADING A LOYALIST RISING IN KENT
FOR TO A GREAT MEASURE OF TROUBLE IT ALLOWS SO SMALL A QUANTITY OF JOY THAT ONE MAY SEE TIS MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP US ALIVE WITHAL
SHE SAYS THAT SEALS ARE MUCH IN FASHION AND BY SHOWING ME SOME THAT SHE HAS HAS SET ME A-LONGING FOR SOME TOO
NO YOU ARE MISTAKEN
I WENT TO YOUR LODGING TO TELL YOU THAT VISITING THE SICK WAS PART OF THE WORK OF THE DAY BUT YOU WERE GONE AND SO I WENT TO BED AGAIN WHERE YOUR LETTER FOUND ME THIS MORNING
TIS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT SHE CAN FIND HERE TO PRESENT YOU WITHAL AND I AM MUCH IN DOUBT WHETHER YOU WILL NOT PAY TOO DEAR FOR IT IF YOU DISCHARGE THE CARRIAGE
IF I KEEP THE LOCK YOU GIVE ME BETTER THAN YOU DO ALL THE REST I SHALL NOT SPARE YOU
FROM THIS TIME WE LOSE SIGHT OF DOROTHY AND ARE REDUCED TO FORM OUR OPINION OF THE TERMS ON WHICH SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE FROM VERY SLIGHT INDICATIONS WHICH MAY EASILY MISLEAD US WHEN AN EDITOR IS IN THE PLEASANT POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO RETAIN AN HISTORIAN OF THE EMINENCE OF MACAULAY TO WRITE A LARGE PORTION OF HIS INTRODUCTION IT WOULD ILL BECOME HIM TO ALTER AND CORRECT HIS STATEMENTS WHEREVER THERE WAS A PETTY INACCURACY
LETTER 48 SIR,--'TIS BUT AN HOUR SINCE YOU WENT AND I AM WRITING TO YOU ALREADY
SURE I AM NOT INSENSIBLE NOR VERY ILL-NATURED AND YET I'LL SWEAR I THINK I DO NOT AFFLICT MYSELF HALF SO MUCH AS ANOTHER WOULD DO THAT HAD MY LOSSES
I COULD WISH YOU A THOUSAND LITTLE MISCHANCES I AM SO ANGRY WITH YOU
HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF AN ADVICE TO HIS SON IN TWO PARTS AND SOME TRACTS PUBLISHED IN 1722 OF COURSE LONG AFTER HIS DEATH
THIS IS AN ILL DOCTRINE FOR ME TO PREACH
I AM SORRY I CANNOT FOLLOW YOUR COUNSEL IN KEEPING FAIR WITH FORTUNE
LORD ARUNDEL WAS HENRY COMPTON'S SECOND
AND I CAN ONLY BE ALLOWED TIME TO TELL YOU THAT I AM IN KENT AND IN A HOUSE SO STRANGELY CROWDED WITH COMPANY THAT I AM WEARY AS A DOG ALREADY THOUGH I HAVE BEEN HERE BUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS
BUT TIS SO COMMON A CALAMITY THAT I DARE NOT MURMUR AT IT
AND TIS MORE MY BELIEF THAT YOU YOURSELF SPEAK IT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE ME AND TO YOUR WISHES THAN YOUR HOPES
MY COUSIN FRANKLIN AS YOU OBSERVE VERY WELL MAY SAY FINE THINGS NOW SHE IS WARM IN MOOR PARK BUT SHE IS VERY MUCH ALTERED IN HER OPINIONS SINCE HER MARRIAGE IF THESE BE HER OWN
AND FOR EXAMPLE THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT NEED MY COUNSEL YET I CANNOT BUT TELL YOU THAT I THINK TWERE VERY WELL THAT YOU TOOK SOME CARE TO MAKE MY LADY B
MY LORD LISLE'S PROPOSED EMBASSY TO SWEDEN IS WE SEE STILL DELAYED
AND DREADFUL TO THOSE FEW WHO HER RESEMBLE AND HER STEPS PURSUE THAT DEATH SHOULD LICENSE HAVE TO RANGE AMONG THE FAIR THE WISE THE VIRTUOUS AND THE YOUNG
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CONSIDER SERIOUSLY WITH YOURSELF WHAT CAN ENTER INTO COMPARISON WITH THE SAFETY OF YOUR SOUL
THE NOTE YOU WRIT TO JANE CAME IN ONE OF NAN'S BY COLLINS BUT NOTHING ELSE
WHEN YOU HAVE PROMISED ME THIS TIS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT I MAY PROMISE YOU SHALL SEE ME SHORTLY
I'LL NEVER GIVE YOU ANY MORE ALARMS BY GOING ABOUT TO PERSUADE YOU AGAINST THAT YOU HAVE FOR ME
SHE LIVED ALONE UNTIL HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WHICH TOOK PLACE IN JANUARY 1650
COOPER WHO IS STYLED BY CONTEMPORARY EULOGISTS THE PRINCE OF LIMNERS GAVE A STRENGTH AND FREEDOM TO THE ART WHICH IT HAD NOT FORMERLY POSSESSED
I'LL SEE YOU ANON
AND IF I EVER FORGET WHAT I OWE YOU OR EVER ENTERTAINED A THOUGHT OF KINDNESS FOR ANY PERSON IN THE WORLD BESIDES MAY I LIVE A LONG AND MISERABLE LIFE
IT WAS THE LAST FORTRESS TO SURRENDER
WHAT BESIDES YOUR CONSIDERATION COULD OBLIGE ME TO LIVE AND LOSE ALL THE REST OF MY FRIENDS THUS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
FOR SIR JUSTINIAN IS STILL WIFE-HUNTING AND COMES BACK TO RENEW HIS SUIT WITH DOROTHY AFTER THIS DATE
BOTH THESE ROMANCES WERE MUCH ADMIRED EVEN BY PEOPLE OF TASTE
LIFE AT CHICKSANDS
IF THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ME BELIEVE YOURS TO BE PERFECT CONFIRM IT TO ME BY A KIND FREEDOM
OF THOSE LIVING SIR JOHN THE ELDEST SON AND THE FIRST BARONET MARRIED HIS COUSIN ELEANOR DANVERS AND LIVED IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE DURING HIS FATHER'S LIFE
AND IF I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE MY HAPPIEST PART OF IT SHOULD CONSIST IN CONCEALMENT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE TWO PERSONS IN THE WORLD KNOW THAT THERE WAS SUCH A ONE IN IT AS YOUR FAITHFUL
SIR JUSTINIAN HAS AT LENGTH FOUND A SECOND WIFE
I NEVER HAD THE CONFIDENCE IN MY LIFE TO PRESUME ANYTHING WELL DONE THAT I HAD NOBODY'S OPINION IN BUT MY OWN
I AM STILL HERE IN TOWN BUT HAD NO HAND I CAN ASSURE YOU IN THE NEW DISCOVERED PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR
HE WAS THEN IN LOVE WITH A MAID OF HONOUR TO THE QUEEN ONE MRS HARESON THAT HAD BEEN CHAMBER-FELLOW TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW WHILST SHE LIVED AT COURT AND THAT BROUGHT ON THE ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN HIM AND MY SISTER
SURE THE POOR WOMAN IS A LITTLE DISTRACTED SHE COULD NEVER BE SO RIDICULOUS ELSE AS TO VENTURE AT WRITING BOOKS AND IN VERSE TOO
YOU ARE SPOKEN OF WITH THE REVERENCE DUE TO A PERSON THAT I SEEM TO LIKE AND FOR AS MUCH AS THEY KNOW OF YOU YOU DO DESERVE A VERY GOOD ESTEEM
HE WAS CONCERNED IN A RISING IN 1648 WHEN THE KING WAS IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE OBJECT OF WHICH WAS TO RESCUE AND RESTORE THE ROYAL PRISONER
THUS DOROTHY LEAVES CHICKSANDS HER LAST WORDS FROM HER OLD HOME TO TEMPLE BREATHING HER LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR HIM
HER DAUGHTER ANNE MARRIED LORD RICH AND DIED SUDDENLY IN 1638
THAT ALL THE COMPANIES BOTH OLD AND NEW SHALL BE OF 120 MEN THAT USED TO BE OF 50 AND EVERY TROOP 80 THAT USED TO BE OF 45
NO I ALLOW IT TO YOUR ILL-HUMOUR AND THAT TO THE CROSSES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMON TO US
TIS JANE I KNOW TELLS ALL THESE TALES OF ME
AND WHEN I SEE THEM DRIVING HOME THEIR CATTLE I THINK TIS TIME FOR ME TO RETURN TOO
WOULD YOU WOULD ASK SOME ONE WHO KNEW HIM WHETHER HE BE NOT MUCH MORE OF AN ASS SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THAN HE WAS BEFORE
THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MRS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
HE DOES NOT PREACH SO ALWAYS SURE
YOUR PATIENCE TILL I HAVE DRUNK AND THEN I'LL FOR YOU AGAIN
LORD SANDYS COUNTRY HOUSE WAS MOTESFONT OR MOTTISFONT PRIORY IN HAMPSHIRE WHICH THE KING HAD GIVEN HIM IN EXCHANGE FOR CHELSEA IN WESTMINSTER SO SAYS LELAND THE ANTIQUARY AND SCHOLAR IN HIS ITINERARY
BUT IF YOU WRITE ILL TWAS NO GREAT COMPLIMENT TO ME
BUT I DID NOT MAKE SUCH HASTE BACK AGAIN I CAN ASSURE YOU
IF HE COMES I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU BEFORE I SEAL THIS UP WHERE YOU ARE LIKELY TO FIND ME
THERE HAS BEEN COMPLAINTS MADE ON ME ALREADY TO MY ELDEST BROTHER ONLY IN GENERAL OR AT LEAST HE TAKES NOTICE OF NO MORE WHAT OFFERS I REFUSE AND WHAT A STRANGE HUMOUR HAS POSSESSED ME OF BEING DEAF TO THE ADVICE OF ALL MY FRIENDS
AND WHAT HOPE CAN I HAVE OF THAT WHEN THE FORTUNE THAT CAN ONLY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ME DEPENDS UPON A THOUSAND ACCIDENTS AND CONTINGENCIES THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PLACE TIS IN AND THE GOVERNMENT IT MAY FALL UNDER YOUR FATHER'S LIFE OR HIS SUCCESS HIS DISPOSAL OF HIMSELF AND OF HIS FORTUNE BESIDES THE TIME THAT MUST NECESSARILY BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE ALL THIS AND THE CHANGES THAT MAY PROBABLY BRING WITH IT WHICH TIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO FORESEE
BUSSY IS A SERVANT OF THE DUKE OF AVENSON MARGARET'S BROTHER WITH WHOM MARGARET IS VERY INTIMATE
NOT TO WRONG HIM HE NEVER SAID TO ME WHATE'ER HE THOUGHT A WORD IN PREJUDICE OF YOU IN YOUR OWN PERSON AND I NEVER HEARD HIM ACCUSE ANY BUT YOUR FORTUNE AND MY INDISCRETION
THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOME HITCH AS TO WHO SHOULD APPEAR IN THE TREATY
LET THEM TRUST TO IT THAT THINK GOOD
YOU SAY NOTHING OF YOUR FATHER'S SICKNESS THEREFORE I HOPE HE IS WELL AGAIN
BUT SINCE IT CANNOT BE I WILL ATTEMPT IT NO MORE
SANDIS EVERY DAY UNLESS SOME RACE OR OTHER CARRY HER OUT OF TOWN
BUT ON THE CONTRARY IF IT BE ONCE CONDEMNED NOTHING CAN BE FOUND ILL ENOUGH TO COMPARE IT WITH
I AM SURE HE HAS NOT SEEN HER THIS SIX YEAR AND I THINK BUT ONCE IN HIS LIFE
YOU ARE NOT HALF SO KIND
IS YOUR FATHER RETURNED YET AND DO YOU THINK OF COMING OVER IMMEDIATELY
BUT A DRAFT OF IT IN SOMERS TRACTS REMAINS TO US FOR REFERENCE
BUT GRIEF ALONE WILL NOT KILL
WHAT ART THOU LOVE THOU GREAT MYSTERIOUS THING
RATHER THAN BE OBLIGED TO THAT I'LL MAKE NONE
IT WOULD BE IN 1643 THAT THE SIEGE OF CASTLE CORNET BEGAN THE SAME YEAR IN WHICH THE RENTS OF THE CHICKSANDS ESTATE WERE ASSIGNED AWAY FROM THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER TO ONE MR JOHN BLACKSTONE M.P
YET TIS FIT YOU SHOULD KNOW ALL MY FAULTS LEST YOU SHOULD REPENT YOUR BARGAIN WHEN TWILL NOT BE IN YOUR POWER TO RELEASE YOURSELF
POOR MISTRESS OSBORNE FELL ILL OF THE SMALL-POX AND THOUGH SHE ESCAPED WITH LIFE LOST ALL HER BEAUTY
IT IS ONE THING TO PROCLAIM AMUSEMENTS ANOTHER TO ABOLISH THEM
HE IS SO FAMED THAT I EXPECTED RARE THINGS OF HIM AND SERIOUSLY I LISTENED TO HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN ST PAUL
TIS NOT THEIR MERIT BUT OUR FOLLY THAT IS ALWAYS PRESUMED TO CAUSE IT
WELL WHO CAN HELP THESE THINGS
HARROLD CAME LATE HOME ON THURSDAY NIGHT WITH SUCH AN ACCOUNT AS YOUR BOY GAVE YOU
YOU WERE PREPARED IT SEEMS BUT I WAS SURPRISED I CONFESS
I BEGIN TO BE OF YOUR OPINION OF HIM THAT WHEN THE ROMAN CHURCH FIRST PROPOUNDED WHETHER IT WERE NOT CONVENIENT FOR PRIESTS NOT TO MARRY SAID THAT IT MIGHT BE CONVENIENT ENOUGH BUT SURE IT WAS NOT OUR SAVIOUR'S INTENTION FOR HE COMMANDED THAT ALL SHOULD TAKE UP THEIR CROSS AND FOLLOW HIM
HE DIED IN MARCH 1654 AFTER A LONG WEARY ILLNESS
THE PARISH REGISTER OF CAMPTON DESCRIBES HIM AS A FRIEND TO THE POOR A LOVER OF LEARNING A MAINTAINER OF DIVINE EXERCISES THERE IS STILL AN INSCRIPTION TO HIS MEMORY ON A MARBLE MONUMENT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CHANCEL IN CAMPTON CHURCH
YOU COULD WRITE ME A FINE LONG LETTER WHEN I DID NOT DESERVE IT HALF SO WELL
BUT BY YOUR OWN RULES THEN MAY I NOT EXPECT THE SAME FROM YOU
ALL THE STORIES HAVE TOO NEAR A RESEMBLANCE WITH THOSE OF OTHER ROMANCES THERE IS NOTHING NEW OR SURPRENANT IN THEM
THE NEXT THING I DESIGNED TO BE RID ON WAS A SCURVY SPLEEN THAT I HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO AND TO THAT PURPOSE WAS ADVISED TO DRINK THE WATERS
NEVER ANYBODY HAD SUCH LUCK WITH SERVANTS
TIS CERTAIN WHAT YOU SAY THAT WHERE DIVINE OR HUMAN LAWS ARE NOT POSITIVE WE MAY BE OUR OWN JUDGES
THEY HAD ONLY TWO CHILDREN LIVING HAVING LOST AS MANY AS SEVEN IN THEIR INFANCY
BUT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A MAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SO HANDSOME SO CAPABLE OF BEING MADE A PRETTY GENTLEMAN FOR THOUGH HE WAS NO PROUD PHILOSOPHER AS THE FRENCHMEN SAY HE WAS THAT WHICH GOOD COMPANY AND A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE MADE EQUAL TO MANY THAT THINK THEMSELVES VERY WELL AND ARE THOUGHT SO TRANSFORMED INTO THE DIRECT SHAPE OF A GREAT BOY NEWLY COME FROM SCHOOL
OF MR TALBOT I FIND NOTHING
HER DISPOSITION I LIKE EXTREMELY IT HAS A GREAT DEAL OF PRACTICAL WIT
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ROBBED WOMEN IN LOVE MEN IN DEBT ALL IN TROUBLE AND DOUBT FROM THE KING DOWNWARDS SOUGHT HIS AID
TEMPLE
TEMPLE
FROM WHICH WE MAY DRAW THE INFERENCE THAT SHE WAS A POLITICAL NOTABILITY
SHE SAW NO LIGHT BUT CANDLES IN THREE YEARS NOR CAME ABROAD IN FIVE
THERE IS A BEAUTY IN YOUTH THAT EVERY ONE HAS ONCE IN THEIR LIVES
BUT TO THAT I ANSWERED THAT THOUGH HE PRETENDED GREAT KINDNESS HE HAD FOR HER I NEVER HEARD OF MUCH SHE HAD FOR HIM AND KNEW SHE MARRIED HIM MERELY FOR ADVANTAGE
IF IT WERE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD BE HAPPY I THINK BUT THEN I SHOULD BE SO TOO AND THAT MUST NOT BE,--A FALSE AND AN INCONSTANT PERSON CANNOT MERIT IT I AM SURE
REMEMBER THAT YOU OWE ME A LONG LETTER AND SOMETHING FOR FORGIVING YOUR LAST
WOULD YOU HAD HEARD HOW I HAVE BEEN CATECHIZED FOR YOU AND SEEN HOW SOBERLY I SIT AND ANSWER TO INTERROGATORIES
AND IF IN ALL THAT TIME THEY NEVER DISAGREED THEY SHOULD THEN BE PERMITTED TO MARRY IF THEY PLEASE
DOROTHY MENTIONS AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT SHE HAS BEEN DRINKING THE WATERS THOUGH SHE DOES NOT SAY AT WHAT PLACE
BUT NO MORE OF THIS SAD TALK
TO LET YOU SEE I DID NOT REPENT ME OF THE LAST COMMISSION I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER
I HOPE THE OCCASION WAS GOOD YOU MUST ACCOUNT TO ME FOR ALL THAT I LOST BY IT
SIR PETER HIMSELF HEARD NOTHING OF HER AND HER SONS IN ENGLAND WHO WERE DOING ALL THEY COULD FOR THEIR FATHER AMONG THE KING'S FRIENDS DID NOT KNOW OF HER WHEREABOUTS
AND THOUGH HE MAKES HIS PEOPLE SAY FINE HANDSOME THINGS TO ONE ANOTHER YET THEY ARE NOT EASY AND NAIVE LIKE THE FRENCH AND THERE IS A LITTLE HARSHNESS IN MOST OF THE DISCOURSE THAT ONE WOULD TAKE TO BE THE FAULT OF A TRANSLATOR RATHER THAN OF AN AUTHOR
SIR,--HAVING TIRED MYSELF WITH THINKING I MEAN TO WEARY YOU WITH READING AND REVENGE MYSELF THAT WAY FOR ALL THE UNQUIET THOUGHTS YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
IF YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE FIRST PART OF CYRUS I SHOULD BE GLAD MR HOLLINGSWORTH HAD IT BECAUSE I MENTIONED SOME SUCH THING IN MY LAST TO MY LADY
TO SAY YOU WERE A BEGGAR YOUR FATHER NOT WORTH L4000 IN THE WHOLE WORLD WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HAVING NO RELIGION NOR NO HONOUR
IF YOU WERE WITH ME I COULD MAKE SPORT OF ALL THIS
I DO NOT THINK A PROPOS TO TELL ANYBODY THAT YOU AND I ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS AND IT WERE BETTER SURE IF NOBODY KNEW IT BUT WE OURSELVES
AND THEN FALLS INTO DISCOVERIES OF STRENGTH OF REASON AND THE POWER OF PHILOSOPHY TILL SHE CONFOUNDS HERSELF AND ALL THAT HEAR HER
AT THE FURTHER END OF THE WALL ARE TWO GOTHIC WINDOWS CLAUSTRAL REMNANTS LIGHTING NOW PERHAPS THE DINING-HALL WHERE COUSIN MOLLE AND DOROTHY SAT IN STATE OR THE SALOON WHERE THE LATTER RECEIVED HER SERVANTS
THIS IS TO LET YOU SEE TIS NOT IMPOSSIBLE WHAT I ASK NOR UNREASONABLE
IF IT BE NO SECRET YOU MAY TELL ME
THE SERVANTS AND COMPANIONS OF LADIES OF THAT DATE WERE THEMSELVES GENTLEWOMEN OF GOOD BREEDING
BUT HOW ANGRY WAS I TO SEE HIM SPOIL THIS AGAIN BY BRINGING OUT A LETTER THIS WOMAN LEFT BEHIND HER FOR THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN WHERE SHE DISCOVERS A PASSION FOR HIM AND MAKES THAT THE REASON WHY SHE DID IT
MY BROTHER TELLS ME THEY MEET SOMETIMES AND HAVE THE MOST ADO TO PULL OFF THEIR HATS TO ONE ANOTHER THAT CAN BE AND NEVER SPEAK
WHICH WE TOO AS WELL AS TEMPLE MAY KNOW EXISTED IN DOROTHY
AND NOW DO YOU JUDGE WHETHER I AM NOT VERY UNHAPPY AND WHETHER THAT SADNESS IN MY FACE YOU USED TO COMPLAIN OF WAS NOT SUITED TO MY FORTUNE
I CANNOT FIND THAT HER DAUGHTER MARRIED ONE OF THE SPENCERS
I SHALL NOT BE SO UNREASONABLE AS TO DESIRE THAT FOR MY SATISFACTION YOU SHOULD DENY YOURSELF A RECREATION THAT IS PLEASING TO YOU AND VERY INNOCENT SURE WHEN TIS NOT USED IN EXCESS BUT I CANNOT CONSENT YOU SHOULD DISORDER YOURSELF WITH IT AND JANE WAS CERTAINLY IN THE RIGHT WHEN SHE TOLD YOU I WOULD HAVE CHID IF I HAD SEEN YOU SO ENDANGER A HEALTH THAT I AM SO MUCH CONCERNED IN
AND A SERIES OF LETTERS WRITTEN BY A VIRTUOUS AMIABLE AND SENSIBLE GIRL AND INTENDED FOR THE EYE OF HER LOVER ALONE CAN SCARCELY FAIL TO THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE RELATIONS OF THE SEXES
YES IF WE CANNOT ACTUALLY VISUALIZE THE PAST THESE LETTERS WILL AT LEAST CONVINCE US THAT THE PAST DID EXIST A PAST NOT WHOLLY UNLIKE THE PRESENT
IN 1649 SIR PETER FINDING THE PROMISES OF REWARD MADE BY THE PRINCE TO BE AS SINCERE AS THOSE OF HIS FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND PROBABLY THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW WHO WAS A STRICT PARLIAMENT MAN HIS HOUSE AND A PORTION OF HIS ESTATES AT CHICKSANDS WERE RESTORED TO HIM
IN THE MEANTIME I EXPECT WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE TO HEAR OF YOUR SAFE ARRIVAL
1653 IV
I EXPECT MY ELDEST BROTHER TO-DAY
LETTER 32._--THINGS BEING MORE SETTLED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD SIR JOHN TEMPLE IS RETURNING TO IRELAND WHERE HE INTENDS TAKING HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE ROLLS ONCE AGAIN
IN THE SUMMER OF 1671 THERE OCCURRED AN INCIDENT THAT REMINDS US CONSIDERABLY OF THE DOROTHY OSBORNE OF FORMER DAYS
WHEN YOUR FATHER PRESSED YOUR COMING OVER HE TOLD YOU YOU NEEDED NOT DOUBT EITHER HIS POWER OR HIS WILL
MY CELL IS ALMOST FINISHED AND WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU'LL FIND ME IN IT AND BRING ME BOTH THE REST I HOPE
I AM STILL OBLIGED TO WAIT MY BROTHER PEYTON AND HIS LADY COMING
FURTHER THAN THIS I KNOW NOTHING TO WISH
HER SISTER MARRIED THE EARL OF LEICESTER AND SHE IS THEREFORE AUNT TO LADY SUNDERLAND AND ALGERNON SYDNEY
FOR I REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN B THERE AND HAD OCCASION TO LOOK UP INTO THE GALLERY WHERE HE SAT TO ANSWER A VERY CIVIL SALUTE GIVEN ME FROM THENCE BY MR FREEMAN AND SAW B IN A GREAT WHISPER WITH ANOTHER THAT SAT NEXT HIM AND POINTING TO ME
I AM MY BEST DEAR'S MOST AFFECTIONATE D.T
BUT NO I'LL SWEAR TIS NOT THAT I INTEND IN WHAT I DO
NEVER TRUST ME IF I HAD NOT A SUSPICION FROM THE FIRST THAT TWAS THAT ILL-LOOKED FELLOW B WHO MADE THAT STORY MR D TOLD YOU
HIS LETTERS ARE LOST BUT HERS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED
BUT TIS A BITCH AND THOSE ARE ALWAYS MUCH LESS THAN THE DOGS
I'LL SAY THAT YOU ARE MUCH MY FRIEND AND THAT I HAVE RESOLVED NOT TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF BUT WITH YOUR CONSENT AND APPROBATION AND THEREFORE HE MUST MAKE ALL HIS COURT TO YOU
WHICH SHE WAS APT TO BELIEVE BECAUSE TO HER KNOWLEDGE I HAD REFUSED VERY GOOD FORTUNES AND NAMED SOME SO FAR BEYOND HIS REACH THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD DASHED ALL HIS HOPES
IF SO TIS VERY UNKIND
THEY ARE AT PRESENT IN THE HANDS OF THE REV
BUT I WAS IN LONDON FROM THIS WE MAY IMAGINE THE EARL DID NOT GREATLY APPROVE THE MATCH
THOMAS BENNET HIS FATHER AN ALDERMAN OF THE CITY OF LONDON HAD BOUGHT A SEAT NEAR CAMBRIDGE CALLED BABRAHAM OR BABRAM THAT HAD BELONGED TO SIR TOBY PALAVICINI
AND THE PLEASANTNESS ON'T IS THAT IT SHOULD BE TO MY LORD ST JOHN
BUT IF IT BE BY MY FAULT I'LL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO DEMAND SATISFACTION FOR IT WHEN YOU COME
UNDER DATE MAY 1653 HE WRITES:--"TOWARDS THE END OF EASTER TERM THE LORD CHANDOS FOR KILLING IN DUEL MR COMPTON THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IS TO SAY IN MARCH
THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ON THE LIST WAS HENRY CROMWELL
HE MARRIED LADY ARABELLA STUART DAUGHTER OF CHARLES STUART EARL OF LENNOX UNCLE OF KING JAMES I FOR WHICH MATRIMONIAL ADVENTURE HE WAS IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER
HERE IS THE LETTER GOOD SISTER,--I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR THE LOSS OF OUR GOOD BROTHER WHOSE SHORT TIME GIVES US A SAD EXAMPLE OF OUR FRAIL CONDITION
IT IS TO SOME EXTENT BY SUCH REFERENCES AS THESE THAT THE LETTERS HAVE BEEN DATED AND GROUPED
BUT SHE IS BROKE LOOSE FROM AN OLD MISERABLE HUSBAND THAT LIVED SO LONG SHE THINKS IF SHE DOES NOT MAKE HASTE SHE SHALL NOT HAVE TIME TO SPEND WHAT HE LEFT
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE III.'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL
SIR SAMUEL WAS LORD OF THE MANOR OF HAWNES AND IN THE HAWNES PARISH REGISTER THERE ARE NOTICES OF THE CHRISTENINGS OF HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS
BUT NOW I WILL RISE AND DESPATCH SOME VISITS THAT I OWE THAT TO-MORROW MAY BE ENTIRELY YOURS
I HAVE WRIT CONSTANTLY TO HER BUT I DO NOT SO MUCH WONDER THAT THE REST ARE LOST AS THAT SHE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE RECEIVED THAT WHICH I SENT TO YOU NOR THE BOOKS
IT MUST BE LOST BY THE PORTER THAT WAS SENT WITH IT AND TWAS VERY UNHAPPY THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING IN IT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN ORDINARY
FOR I AM NO DISSEMBLER
HOWEVER REMEMBER YOU HAVE PROMISED ME TO BE CAREFUL OF YOURSELF AND THAT IF I SECURE WHAT YOU HAVE ENTRUSTED ME WITH YOU WILL ANSWER FOR THE REST
SOMETIMES METHINKS I WOULD FAIN KNOW MY DOOM WHATEVER IT BE
THEY DO SO FRIGHT ME WITH STRANGE STORIES OF WHAT THE SPLEEN WILL BRING ME TO IN TIME THAT I AM KEPT IN AWE WITH THEM LIKE A CHILD
BESIDES I WAS WILLING IT SHOULD DO ME SOME SERVICE IN REQUITAL FOR THE PAINS I HAD TAKEN FOR IT
SHE THAT UNDERSTOOD HIM WELL ENOUGH BUT WOULD NOT SEEM TO DO SO SAID SHE KNEW NOT UNLESS IT WERE THAT I LIKED MY PRESENT CONDITION SO WELL THAT I DID NOT CARE TO CHANGE IT
SO MUCH FOR OUR RULERS AND POLITICS
WILLIAM FIENNES LORD SAY AND SELE WAS ONE OF THE CHIEFS OF THE INDEPENDENT PARTY A REPUBLICAN AND ONE OF THE FIRST TO BEAR ARMS AGAINST THE KING
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WOULD HARDLY BE WORTH NOTICING BUT FOR THE ALMOST INCREDIBLE FACT THAT FIFTY YEARS LATER HE WAS SO ABSURD AS TO SET UP HIS OWN AUTHORITY AGAINST THAT OF BENTLEY ON QUESTIONS OF GREEK HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY
SUBSEQUENTLY THE VIRGIN WAS OMITTED AND THERE REMAINED ONLY THE VASE OF FLOWERS
THE CARRIER HAS GIVEN ME A GREAT CHARGE TO TELL YOU THAT IT CAME SAFE AND THAT I MUST DO HIM RIGHT
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF YOUNG LORD BEAUCHAMP WHOSE DEATH DOROTHY DEPLORES
TWOULD BE AN INJURY TO THE LADIES TO SUPPOSE THEY COULD DO SO AND A GREATER TO HIS HERO'S CIVILITY IF HE SHOULD PUT HIM UPON BEING CRUEL TO THEM SINCE HE WAS TO LOVE BUT ONE
AND NOTHING LESS THAN MY KINDNESS FOR YOU COULD HAVE MADE ME TAKE SO PATIENTLY AS I DID HIS SAYING TO SOME THAT KNEW ME AT YORK THAT HE WAS FORCED TO BRING YOU THITHER AND AFTERWARDS TO SEND YOU OVER LEST YOU SHOULD HAVE MARRIED ME
PARTED IF IT WERE LEFT IN THEIR CHOICE
THEY ARE BOTH VERY GOOD
IF WHAT YOU SAY OF MY LADY LEPPINGTON BE OF YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE I SHALL BELIEVE YOU BUT OTHERWISE I CAN ASSURE YOU I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT PRETEND TO KNOW HER VERY WELL THAT HER KINDNESS TO COMPTON WAS VERY MODERATE AND THAT SHE NEVER LIKED HIM SO WELL AS WHEN HE DIED AND GAVE HER HIS ESTATE
AND YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE I NEVER CAN BE OTHER THAN YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND
LORD BROGHILL WAS ACTIVE IN FORWARDING THE RESTORATION IN IRELAND AND IN REWARD OF HIS SERVICES WAS MADE EARL OF ORRERY
NEVER TRUST ME IF I WRITE MORE THAN YOU THAT LIVE IN A DESOLATED COUNTRY WHERE YOU MIGHT FINISH A ROMANCE OF TEN TOMES BEFORE ANYBODY INTERRUPTED YOU--I THAT LIVE IN A HOUSE THE MOST FILLED OF ANY SINCE THE ARK AND WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU ONE HAS HARDLY TIME FOR THE MOST NECESSARY OCCASIONS
I COULD TELL YOU WITHOUT ABANDONING THE TRUTH THAT IT IS PART OF YOUR DEVOYRE TO CORRECT THE IMPERFECTIONS YOU FIND UNDER MY HAND AND THAT MY TROUBLE RESEMBLES MY WONDER YOU CAN LET ME BE DISSATISFIED
TO BE MY WEDDED WIFE AND DO ALSO IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND BEFORE THESE WITNESSES PROMISE TO BE UNTO THEE A LOVING AND FAITHFUL HUSBAND THEN THE WOMAN IN SIMILAR FORMULA PROMISES TO BE A LOVING FAITHFUL AND OBEDIENT WIFE AND THE MAGISTRATE PRONOUNCED THE PARTIES TO BE MAN AND WIFE
WHETHER THE MR GREY HERE WRITTEN OF MADE LOVE TO ONE OR BOTH OF THE LADIES--JANE SEYMOUR AND ANNE PERCY--IT IS DIFFICULT NOW TO SAY
MY NIECE IS STILL WITH ME BUT HER FATHER THREATENS TO FETCH HER AWAY
THE EXPRESSION IS STILL KNOWN TO FISHMONGERS AND OTHERS WHO ALSO REFER TO THE ADAM AND EVE IN A SHRIMP A KINDRED FORMATION
SIR HARRY YELVERTON SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A MAN OF SUPERIOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SERIOUS LEARNING
AFTER EIGHTEEN SHE SAYS THERE IS NO FACE BUT DECAYS APPARENTLY
REINE MARGUERITE IS PROBABLY THE TRANSLATION BY ROBERT CODRINGTON OF THE MEMORIALS OF MARGARET OF VALOIS FIRST WIFE OF HENRI IV
HE LIVES WITHIN THREE OR FOUR MILES OF ME AND ONE DAY THAT I HAD BEEN TO VISIT A LADY THAT IS NEARER HIM THAN ME AS I CAME BACK I MET A COACH WITH SOME COMPANY IN'T THAT I KNEW AND THOUGHT MYSELF OBLIGED TO SALUTE
BE THIS OUR BARGAIN THEN
WHEN I HAD DINED I TOOK A COACH AND WENT TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS EVER A LETTER FOR ME AND WAS THIS ONCE SO LUCKY AS TO FIND ONE
THE YOUNGER BROTHER WAS A SERVANT A GREAT WHILE TO MY FAIR NEIGHBOUR BUT COULD NOT BE RECEIVED
THESE ARE DANGEROUS COURSES
AND IT HAPPENED THAT ALGERNON SYDNEY SAT NEXT TO THE SPEAKER ON THE RIGHT HAND

THE NEW YEAR BEGINS ON MARCH 25TH AND THE LORD ARUNDEL OF WARDOUR ONE OF HIS SECONDS WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR TRIAL FOR THEIR LIVES AT THE UPPER BENCH IN WESTMINSTER HALL WHEN IT WAS FOUND MANSLAUGHTER ONLY AS BY A JURY AT KINGSTON-UPON-THAMES IT HAD BEEN FOUND FORMERLY
I COULD TELL YOU SUCH A STORY TIS TOO LONG TO BE WRITTEN AS WOULD MAKE YOU SEE WHAT I NEVER DISCOVER'D IN MYSELF BEFORE THAT I AM A VALIANT LADY
TIS NOT TO BE IMAGINED THE RIDICULOUS STORIES THEY HAVE MADE NOR HOW J.B
APPENDIX LADY TEMPLE OF LADY TEMPLE THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO BE KNOWN AND WHAT THERE IS CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD BY FOLLOWING THE CAREER OF HER HUSBAND WHICH HAS BEEN WRITTEN AT SOME LENGTH AND WITH LABOURED CARE BY MR COURTENAY
DOES NOT MY COUSIN AT MOOR PARK MISTRUST US A LITTLE
AND WHICH IS MORE THAN ALL TIS BEING MASTERED BY THAT WHICH REASON AND RELIGION TEACHES US TO GOVERN AND IN THAT ONLY GIVES US A PRE-EMINENCE OVER BEASTS
SHE COULD NOT HOWEVER HELP LAUGHING AT THE VILE ENGLISH INTO WHICH THEY WERE TRANSLATED
AND THOUGH YOU SHOULD MISS OF SOME OF MINE LET IT NOT TROUBLE YOU
HE MUST NOT BE A FOOL OF NO SORT NOR PEEVISH NOR ILL-NATURED NOR PROUD NOR COVETOUS
LETTER 61._--LADY TALMASH WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER OF MR MURRAY CHARLES I.'S PAGE AND WHIPPING BOY
MAY IT BE HAPPY TO HER BUT IN MY OPINION HE HAS NOT A GOOD-NATURED LOOK
WHICH CERTAINLY WAS A LIE AS WELL AS THE OTHER FOR I DO NOT THINK SHE EVER HEARD THERE WAS SUCH A ONE IN THE WORLD AS YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND
POOR DOROTHY WHO WILL NOW FORBEAR TO PITY YOU
SHALL I SPEAK A GOOD WORD FOR YOU
SCRIBBLE HOW YOU PLEASE SO YOU MAKE YOUR LETTER LONG ENOUGH
LADY VAVASOUR WAS URSULA DAUGHTER OF WALTER GIFFORD OF CHILLINGTON STAFFORDSHIRE
FOR WHEN HE HAS THE LEAST SUSPICION HE CARRIES IT SO STRANGELY THAT ALL THE WORLD TAKES NOTICE ON'T AND SO OFTEN GUESS AT THE REASON OR ELSE HE TELLS IT
SIR,--I DEFERRED WRITING TO YOU TILL I COULD TELL YOU THAT I HAD RECEIVED ALL MY FINE THINGS WHICH I HAVE JUST NOW DONE
HE ASKED MY PARDON AND I HIS AND HE HAS PROMISED ME NEVER TO SPEAK OF IT TO ME WHILST HE LIVES BUT LEAVE THE EVENT TO GOD ALMIGHTY
WHEN HE RANTS AND RENOUNCES ME I CAN DESPISE HIM
I AM PROOF AGAINST ALL VIOLENCE
NO ALL THE KINDNESS I HAVE OR EVER HAD IS YOURS
DOROTHY WAS PROBABLY BORN IN ENGLAND MAYBE AT CHICKSANDS
THE CONSTANT DESIRE I HAVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND THE SATISFACTION YOUR LETTERS GIVE ME WOULD OBLIGE ONE THAT HAS LESS TIME TO WRITE OFTEN
BUT FROM THIS HOUR WE'LL LIVE QUIETLY NO MORE FEARS NO MORE JEALOUSIES
THE MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO SEXES SEEM TO US TO BE AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE MUTUAL RELATIONS OF ANY TWO GOVERNMENTS IN THE WORLD
BESIDES THAT TWILL BECOME YOU TO MAKE SOME SATISFACTION FOR DOWNRIGHT REFUSING A YOUNG LADY--'TWAS UNMERCIFULLY DONE
ITS PRIESTLY DENIZENS WERE TURNED OUT IN HENRY VIII.'S MONK-HUNTING REIGN 1538 TO THE JOY OR SORROW OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD,--WHO KNOWS NOW
NAY I HAD BROUGHT ME TO-DAY MORE THAN ALL THIS
SHOULD YOU SAVE MY LIFE AGAIN SHOULD YOU MAKE ME ABSOLUTE MASTER OF YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR PERSON TOO I SHOULD ACCEPT NONE OF ALL THIS IN ANY PART OF PAYMENT BUT LOOK UPON YOU AS ONE BEHINDHAND WITH ME STILL
IT IS FASHIONABLE TO DENY MACAULAY EVERYTHING BUT MEMORY
BECAUSE THERE IS NO VERY GREAT LIKELIHOOD OF YOUR BEING AN EMPEROR OR THAT IF YOU WERE I SHOULD HAVE YOUR HEAD
DOROTHY HERSELF WAS BORN IN 1627
WERE MY FACE IN NO MORE DANGER OF CHANGING THAN MY MIND I SHOULD BE WORTH THE SEEING AT THREESCORE
ON STRAFFORD'S DEATH IT IS ASSERTED THAT SHE TRANSFERRED HER AFFECTIONS TO PYM TO WHOM SHE IS SAID TO HAVE BETRAYED THE SECRETS OF THE COURT
AND BECAUSE WITH ALL MY WARINESS TIS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT I MAY BE CAUGHT NOR LIKELY THAT I SHOULD BE WISER THAN ANYBODY ELSE TWERE BEST I THINK THAT I SAID NO MORE ON THIS POINT
BUT IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE HE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY GROSS IGNORANCE AND VICE AND HIS PUBLIC CHARACTER WAS MARKED BY INGRATITUDE AND INSTABILITY
WELL HE IS ALWAYS IN THE EXTREMES
MY COMFORT IS I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE HE WAS A WIDOWER AND NEVER SPOKE TO HIM IN MY LIFE
WHAT THINK YOU HAVE I NOT DONE FAIR FOR ONCE WOULD YOU WISH A LONGER LETTER
I HAVE A GOOD INTEREST IN HER AND IT SHALL BE ALL EMPLOYED IN YOUR SERVICE IF YOU THINK FIT TO MAKE ANY ADDRESSES THERE
I WOULD DO NOBODY NO INJURY
WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT NOBODY CAN EITHER CREATE OR CONTINUE SUCH A BELIEF IN THEMSELVES
SIR THOMAS'S LETTER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE STILTED LETTER-WRITING IN VOGUE AT THAT TIME WHICH DOROTHY TELLS US WAS SO MUCH ADMIRED
FAILING THIS ALL SEARCH AFTER JANE WILL I FEAR PROVE FUTILE AT THIS DISTANT DATE
THE EDITOR HAS A HOLY HORROR OF THE FOOTNOTE AND WOULD HAVE IT RELEGATED TO THOSE BIBLIA A-BIBLIA FROM WHICH CLASS HE IS SURE ELIA WOULD CHEERFULLY EXCEPT DOROTHY'S LETTERS
THESE QUESTIONS CANNOT BE SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG CONSTANT GENERATIONS OF TOMS AFTER A LAPSE OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS
MR B
I AM HALF IN A DREAM ALREADY
YOU HAVE REASON TO THINK YOUR FATHER KIND AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK HIM VERY CIVIL
WHEN AT LAST THE CONSTANCY OF THE LOVERS HAD TRIUMPHED OVER ALL THE OBSTACLES WHICH KINSMEN AND RIVALS COULD OPPOSE TO THEIR UNION A YET MORE SERIOUS CALAMITY BEFELL THEM
I SAY NOTHING OF THE PRETTY HUMOUR YOU FANCIED ME IN IN YOUR DREAM BECAUSE TWAS BUT A DREAM
MAY 25TH 1654 THIS WORLD IS COMPOSED OF NOTHING BUT CONTRARIETIES AND SUDDEN ACCIDENTS ONLY THE PROPORTIONS ARE NOT AT ALL EQUAL
I PITY YOU IN EARNEST MUCH MORE THAN I DO MYSELF
TIS NOW DONE I HOPE AND I HAVE NOTHING LEFT BUT TO PERSUADE YOU TO THAT WHICH I ASSURE MYSELF YOUR OWN JUDGMENT WILL APPROVE IN THE END AND YOUR REASON HAS OFTEN PREVAILED WITH YOU TO OFFER
IT WAS NOTHING THAT I EXPECTED MADE ME REFUSE THESE BUT SOMETHING THAT I FEARED
POMFRET GODOLPHIN AND FALKLAND CELEBRATED HER VIRTUES IN VERSE AND WALLER WROTE HER FUNERAL HYMN WHICH IS STILL KNOWN TO SOME OF US THE LADY RICH IS DEAD
HE HAD FOR THAT DAY EXTRAVAGANT NOTIONS OF CIVIL LIBERTY AND ON THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS HOPES HE APPEARS TO HAVE RETIRED TO THE ISLE OF LUNDY ON THE COAST OF DEVON AND CONTINUED A VOLUNTARY PRISONER THERE UNTIL CROMWELL'S DEATH
NO IN EARNEST MY VERY DREAMS ARE YOURS AND I HAVE GOT SUCH A HABIT OF THINKING OF YOU THAT ANY OTHER THOUGHT INTRUDES AND PROVES UNEASY TO ME
WHEN I URGE AS TIS TRUE THAT THERE IS A NECESSITY OF MY STAY HERE SHE GROWS FURIOUS CRIES YOU WILL DIE WITH MELANCHOLY AND CONFOUNDS ME SO WITH STORIES OF YOUR ILL-HUMOUR THAT I'LL SWEAR I THINK I SHOULD GO MERELY TO BE AT QUIET IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THOUGH THERE WERE NO OTHER REASON FOR IT
I MADE A VISIT T'OTHER DAY TO WELCOME A LADY INTO THIS COUNTRY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD NEWLY BROUGHT DOWN AND BECAUSE I KNEW HIM THOUGH NOT HER AND SHE WAS A STRANGER HERE TWAS A CIVILITY I OWED THEM
FOR IN EARNEST I SHALL BE GOOD FOR NOTHING IF I DO
NO MY DEAR THIS IS OUR LAST MISFORTUNE LET'S BEAR IT NOBLY
TIS A MODEST MELANCHOLY RESERVED MAN WHOSE HEAD IS SO TAKEN UP WITH LITTLE PHILOSOPHIC STUDIES THAT I ADMIRE HOW I FOUND A ROOM THERE
BUT YOU ARE BEATEN TO IT AND TWILL BECOME YOU NOW YOU ARE A CONDUCTOR TO SHOW YOUR VALOUR AND KEEP YOUR COMPANY IN HEART
I RECEIVED ONE FROM HER TO-DAY FULL OF THE KINDEST REPROACHES THAT SHE HAS NOT HEARD FROM ME THIS THREE WEEKS
HOW DO YOU THINK I COULD EVER FILL IT OR WITH WHAT
SO MUCH FOR THE OSBORNES OF CHICKSANDS
ALL OUR LADIES ARE MIGHTILY PLEASED WITH THE EXAMPLE BUT I DO NOT FIND THAT THE MEN INTEND TO FOLLOW IT AND I'LL UNDERTAKE SIR SOLOMON JUSTINIAN WISHES HER IN THE INDIAS FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD PERVERT HIS NEW WIFE
IS THIS NOT VERY LIKE PREACHING
BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING YET NEITHER AND THEREFORE WE'LL LEAVE THE DISCOURSE ON'T TILL THEN IF YOU PLEASE FOR I FIND NO GREAT ENTERTAINMENT IN'T
THE NARROW STREETS OF WORCESTER HAD BEEN BUT LATELY STAINED BY THE BLOOD OF HEAPED CORPSES
IF YOU SAW ONE THAT MY BROTHER SENT MY LADY DIANA LAST WEEK YOU WOULD BELIEVE IT WERE MEANT TO FRIGHT PEOPLE WITHAL
YOU CANNOT THINK THESE THINGS
THEREFORE IF I FORGIVE YOU THIS YOU MAY JUSTLY FORGIVE ME T'OTHER
JOSEPH KEBLE WAS A WELL-KNOWN LAW REPORTER A SON OF SERJEANT RICHARD KEBLE
I THINK YOU HAD BEST COME A WOOING TO HER
IF I EVER MARRY IT SHALL BE MY WEDDING RING
TIS CONFESSED BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT HAPPINESS IN THIS WORLD THOSE THAT HAVE COME THE NEAREST IT HAD MANY THINGS TO WISH
THAT I WILL NEVER MARRY ANY OTHER
SIR,--ALL MY QUARRELS TO YOU ARE KIND ONES FOR SURE TIS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE ANGRY AS FOR YOU TO GIVE ME THE OCCASION
WHY DO YOU DISSEMBLE SO ABOMINABLY
ALL THAT HE SAYS IS SO KIND AND SO OBLIGING SO NATURAL AND SO EASY THAT ONE MAY SEE TIS PERFECTLY HIS DISPOSITION AND HAS NOTHING TO DISGUISE IN IT
AND WHEN A BEGGAR IS THANKFUL FOR A SMALL RELIEF I ALWAYS REPENT IT WAS NOT MORE
SHE CANNOT BE EXCUSED
SHE LEFT A GENTLEMAN THAT I COULD NAME WHOM SHE HAD MUCH MORE OF KINDNESS FOR THAN EVER SHE HAD FOR MR FRANKLIN BECAUSE HIS ESTATE WAS LESS
BUT HE HAD A GREAT ESTATE WAS AS FINE A GENTLEMAN AS EVER ENGLAND BRED AND THE VERY PATTERN OF WISDOM
I SHALL SO PERSECUTE YOU WITH QUESTIONS ELSE WHEN I SEE YOU THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO GO THITHER AGAIN TO AVOID ME
WHETHER IT BE BETTER OR WORSE OR WHETHER YOU ARE AT ALL CONCERN'D IN'T
OH ME HOW SHOULD ONE DO TO MEND ALL THESE
I HAVE KNOWN YOU WHEN OF ALL THE THINGS IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR A DISCONTENT
IT TAKES US UP TO MARCH 1653 ABOUT THE END OF WHICH TIME DOROTHY WENT TO LONDON AND MET TEMPLE AGAIN
YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE ON'T
TEMPLE APPEARS TO HAVE KEPT UP A VERY ACTIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIS MISTRESS
MY LORD PAGET AT WHOSE HOUSE AT MARLOW MR LELY WAS STAYING WAS A PROMINENT LOYALIST BOTH IN CAMP AND COUNCIL CHAMBER
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU HAVE DONE ALL THIS WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY
I NEVER SAW HIM IN MY LIFE BUT HE IS FAMOUS FOR A KIND HUSBAND
AT AN INN WHERE THEY STOPPED IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE BROTHER AMUSED HIMSELF WITH INSCRIBING ON THE WINDOWS HIS OPINION OF THE RULING POWERS
THOUGH I SAY IT MYSELF BEFORE I KNEW YOU I WAS THOUGHT AS WELL AN HUMOURED YOUNG PERSON AS MOST IN ENGLAND
ALL THIS IS FROM MY FRIEND THAT IS NOT YOURS
AND TO SPEAK FREELY TO YOU THAT ARE MY FRIEND I COULD NEVER FIND MY FACE IN A CONDITION TO ADMIT ON'T AND WHEN I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH IT MYSELF I HAD NO REASON TO HOPE THAT ANYBODY ELSE SHOULD
I TALK TO THEM AND FIND THEY WANT NOTHING TO MAKE THEM THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE SO
YES A SLEEPY COUNTRY HOUSE THE WARM EARTH AND HER SHRUBS CREEPING CLOSE UP TO THE VERY SILLS OF THE LOWER WINDOWS SENDING IN MORNING FRAGRANCE I DOUBT NOT WHEN DOROTHY THRUST BACK THE LATTICE AFTER BREAKFAST
ROBERT IS A YOUNGER BROTHER A YEAR OLDER THAN DOROTHY WHO DIED IN SEPTEMBER 1653 AND WHO DID NOT APPARENTLY LIVE AT CHICKSANDS
AND TIS OFTEN SO
CROMWELL INDEED WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS GLORY HIS HONOURS LIE THICK UPON HIM AND NOW IF EVER HE IS THE REGAL CROMWELL THAT VICTOR HUGO HAS PORTRAYED THE UNCROWNED KING OF ENGLAND TRAMPLING UNDER FOOT THAT SACRED LIBERTY THE BASELESS IDEAL FOR WHICH SO MANY HAD FOUGHT AND BLED
THE REFERENCE TO HIS NEW WIFE IS MERELY JOCULAR MEANING HIS NEW WIFE WHEN HE SHALL GET ONE
CHAPTER III LIFE AT CHICKSANDS
AND OF ALL THINGS REMEMBER TO PROVIDE A SAFE ADDRESS FOR YOUR LETTERS WHEN YOU ARE ABROAD
TWAS A KIND FAULT THOUGH
NOTHING SHOWS WE DESERVE A PUNISHMENT SO MUCH AS OUR MURMURING AT IT
FOR I PROTEST IF HE SAW ME NOW HE WOULD NEVER DEIGN TO SEE ME AGAIN
I'LL BEAR IT ALL WITHOUT THE LEAST MURMUR
LADY JANE SEYMOUR THE DUKE OF SOMERSET'S DAUGHTER MARRYING LORD CLIFFORD OF LONESBOROUGH THE SON OF THE EARL OF BURLEIGH AND LIVING TO 1679 WHEN SHE WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY
AND WHO WOULD E'ER HAVE DREAMT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD MY LADY SUNDERLAND THOUGH HE BE A VERY FINE GENTLEMAN AND DOES MORE THAN DESERVE HER
I AM BEGINNING IT TO-DAY
HOW FAIN I WOULD HOPE IT BUT I CANNOT AND SHOULD IT EVER HAPPEN TWOULD BE LONG BEFORE I SHOULD BELIEVE TWAS MEANT FOR ME IN EARNEST OR THAT TWAS OTHER THAN A DREAM
I HAVE SEEN MY FATHER'S REDUCED BETTER THAN L4000 TO NOT L400 A YEAR AND I THANK GOD I NEVER FELT THE CHANGE IN ANYTHING THAT I THOUGHT NECESSARY
HE CONTINUED TO BE MUCH WITH US FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MONTHS TILL MY BROTHER BROGHILL THEN AFTERWARDS EARL OF ORRERY GREW ALSO TO BE PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH THE SAME MRS HARESON
THEY ARE MEANINGLESS TO A DEGREE WHICH WOULD MAKE ONE WONDER AT THE DOCILITY AND PATIENCE OF A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY CONGREGATION IF ONE HAD NOT WITNESSED A SIMILAR SPIRIT IN CONGREGATIONS OF TO-DAY
YES THEY ARE THE MORE TO BE PITIED FOR THAT
NOW HE HAS TRIED ALL WAYS TO DO WHAT HE DESIRES AND FINDS IT IS IN VAIN HE RESOLVES TO REVENGE HIMSELF UPON ME BY REPRESENTING THIS ACTION IN SUCH COLOURS AS WILL AMAZE ALL PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME AND DO NOT KNOW HIM ENOUGH TO DISCERN HIS MALICE TO ME
HE IS PERPETUALLY WRANGLING AND FINDING FAULT AND TO A PERSON THAT DID NOT KNOW HIM WOULD APPEAR THE WORST HUSBAND AND THE MOST IMPERIOUS IN THE WORLD
HOW MUCH RATHER WOULD I HAVE THEM ALL TO YOU THAN TO ANYBODY ELSE
SIR JOHN HAD FIVE SONS
THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE PERSON IN THE WORLD IF HE HAS THAT CANNOT BE JUSTLY HATED AND THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WITHOUT IT CANNOT DESERVE TO BE LOVED
SUCH ENTERTAINMENT HOWEVER MUST ALL THOSE HAVE THAT HAVE TO DO WITH SUCH A PURSE-PROUD AND WILFUL PERSON AS SIR EDWARD HALES
IF YOU WILL HAVE MY OPINION OF HER I THINK SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF WIT AND A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE FOR A WOMAN OF SO HIGH A SPIRIT
CONTENTS I
WILL YOU PARDON THIS STRANGE SCRIBBLED LETTER AND THE DISORDERLINESS ON'T
THE FABLE IS SAID TO HAVE ARISEN FROM A MISINTERPRETATION OF THE TEXT THEY FELL ASLEEP IN THE LORD SIR,--I DID NOT LAY IT AS A FAULT TO YOUR CHARGE THAT YOU WERE NOT GOOD AT DISGUISE
BETWEEN CONWAY AND BEAUMARIS HE WALKED
BUT I AM AFRAID AS YOU SAY THAT TIME WILL NOT MEND IT AND THEREFORE YOU SHALL HAVE IT AS IT IS AS SOON AS MR COOPER WILL VOUCHSAFE TO TAKE THE PAINS TO DRAW IT FOR YOU
YOU ARE MORE CRUEL THAN SHE REGARDING A LIFE THAT'S DEARER TO ME THAN THAT OF THE WHOLE WORLD BESIDES AND WHICH MAKES ALL THE HAPPINESS I HAVE OR EVER SHALL BE CAPABLE OF
MAY YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK IN THE CUTTING IT THAN I HAD WITH MINE
BUT I HAVE NONE AND THEREFORE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP HER HERE AS LONG AS I CAN PERSUADE HER FATHER TO SPARE HER FOR SHE WILL EASILY CONSENT TO IT HAVING SO MUCH OF MY HUMOUR THOUGH IT BE THE WORST THING IN HER AS TO LIKE A MELANCHOLY PLACE AND LITTLE COMPANY
SHE HAS BEEN MY WIFE THIS SEVEN YEARS AND WHOSOEVER PRETENDS THERE MUST ASK MY LEAVE
HOW MIGHT WE DO THAT YOU MIGHT LIE A-BED AND YET I HAVE YOUR LETTER
THE MAINTAINER OF DIVINE EXERCISES THE FRIEND TO THE POOR HER FATHER IS NO LONGER LIVING AND SHE IS NOW EVEN MORE LONELY THAN BEFORE
SHE IS ONE OF MY LORD OF VALENTIA'S DAUGHTERS AND HAS MARRIED AN OLD FELLOW THAT IS SOME THREESCORE AND TEN WHO HAS A HOUSE THAT IS FITTER FOR THE HOGS THAN FOR HER AND A FORTUNE THAT WILL NOT AT ALL RECOMPENSE THE LEAST OF THESE INCONVENIENCES
IF MR PIM WERE ALIVE AGAIN I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD THINK OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AND WHETHER THIS WOULD APPEAR SO GREAT A BREACH OF THE PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT AS THE DEMANDING THE 5 MEMBERS
AND I SHOULD MUCH MORE BE SO IF I DID NOT KNOW YOU TO BE AS GOOD AS YOU ARE FAIR
BUT PERHAPS THIS MIGHT NOT BE TRUE OR IT MAY BE SHE IS NOW GROWN WEARY OF THAT CONSTRAINT SHE PUT UPON HERSELF
I THOUGHT YOU HAD UNDERSTOOD BETTER WHAT KIND OF PERSON I LIKED THAN ANYBODY ELSE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DONE AND THEREFORE DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO MAKE YOU THAT DESCRIPTION TOO
SIR,--YOUR LAST CAME SAFE AND I SHALL FOLLOW YOUR DIRECTION FOR THE ADDRESS OF THIS THOUGH AS YOU SAY I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT SHOULD TEMPT ANYBODY TO SO SEVERE A SEARCH FOR THEM UNLESS IT BE THAT HE IS NOT YET FULLY SATISFIED TO WHAT DEGREE OUR FRIENDSHIP IS GROWN AND THINKS HE MAY BEST INFORM HIMSELF FROM THEM
WILL THE KINDNESS OF THIS LETTER EXCUSE THE SHORTNESS ON'T
SHE TELLS ME SHE SHALL STAY LONG ENOUGH THERE TO HEAR FROM ME ONCE MORE AND THEN SHE IS RESOLVED TO COME AWAY
BY HER REPORT YOUR HUMOUR IS GROWN INSUPPORTABLE
IF I SHOULD EVER LIVE TO SEE THAT COUNTRY AND BE IN'T I SHOULD MAKE EXCELLENT SPORT WITH THEM
THEN HE CAME INTO MY CHAMBER WHERE I SUPPED BUT HE DID NOT
ALL HIS SCRUPLES ARE VERY JUST ONES BUT SUCH AS TIME AND A LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE IF WE WERE EITHER OF US LUCKY TO IT MIGHT SATISFY
SURE IF YOU HAD LIKED THEM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO SULLEN AND A LESS OCCASION WOULD HAVE SERVED TO MAKE YOU ENTERTAIN THEIR DISCOURSE IF THEY HAD BEEN HANDSOME
YOU MAY DIRECT YOUR LETTERS HOW YOU PLEASE HERE WILL BE NOBODY TO RECEIVE IT BUT YOUR
WILL IT BE EVER THUS
SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A WOMAN WHOSE MIND WAS ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH VERY EXTRAORDINARY ATTRIBUTES
BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE ME THUS IN EARNEST I'LL NOT BE SO MUCH HER FRIEND HEREAFTER
BESIDES HIS PERSON AND HIS FORTUNE WITHOUT EXCEPTION HE TELLS ME WHAT AN EXCELLENT HUSBAND HE WAS TO THIS LADY THAT'S DEAD WHO WAS BUT A CROOKED ILL-FAVOURED WOMAN ONLY SHE BROUGHT HIM L1500 A YEAR
PERHAPS TO NEITHER WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH THE MORE STRANGE
I HEAR OF MANY EVERY DAY THAT DO MARRY BUT OF NONE THAT DO WORSE
AND WHEN I HAD WEARIED MYSELF WITH THINKING OF ALL THE UNPLEASING ACCIDENTS THAT MIGHT CAUSE IT I AT LENGTH SAT DOWN WITH A RESOLUTION TO CHOOSE THE BEST TO BELIEVE WHICH WAS THAT AT THE END OF ONE JOURNEY YOU HAD BEGUN ANOTHER WHICH I HAD HEARD YOU SAY YOU INTENDED AND THAT YOUR HASTE OR SOMETHING ELSE HAD HINDERED YOU FROM LETTING ME KNOW IT
I COULD NOT BUT LAUGH TO MYSELF AT THE MEANNESS OF THEIR HUMOUR AND WAS MERRY ENOUGH ALL DAY FOR THE COMPANY WAS VERY GOOD
WHEN THE PARLIAMENT DROVE DR HAMMOND FROM HIS LIVING TEMPLE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT BISHOP-STORTFORD
HE HAS LEFT IT LONG SINCE I SUPPOSE
I HAVE A THIRD TOME HERE AGAINST YOU HAVE DONE WITH THAT SECOND
THUS YOU HAVE ALL MY LATE ADVENTURES AND ALMOST AS MUCH AS THIS PAPER WILL HOLD
IF YOU ARE COME BACK FROM EPSOM I MAY ASK YOU HOW YOU LIKE DRINKING WATER
IN EARNEST TWOULD NOT BE UNPLEASANT TO HEAR OUR DISCOURSE
I AM TIED HERE TO EXPECT MY BROTHER PEYTON AND THEN POSSIBLY WE MAY GO UP TOGETHER FOR I SHOULD BE AT HOME AGAIN BEFORE THE TERM
YOU SEE I SAY ANYTHING TO YOU OUT OF A BELIEF THAT THOUGH MY LETTERS WERE MORE IMPERTINENT THAN THEY ARE YOU WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT THEM NOR WISH THEM SHORTER
AS YOU HAVE EVER LOVED ME DO THIS
BUT I CAN ALLOW THAT ALL SOFT HAIRS ARE GOOD AND SO ARE YOU OR I AM DECEIVED AS MUCH AS YOU ARE IF YOU THINK I DO NOT LOVE YOU ENOUGH
AT THIS PRESENT I CAN ASSURE YOU I AM PLEASED WITH NOBODY BUT YOUR SISTER AND HER I LOVE EXTREMELY AND WILL CALL HER PRETTY
FOR TRUST ME I WAS SO TIRED WITH MY JOURNEY SO DOWD WITH MY COLD AND SO OUT OF HUMOUR WITH OUR PARTING THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH GREAT UNWILLINGNESS TO ANYBODY ELSE
WE COULD NOT EAT IN QUIET FOR THE LETTERS AND PRESENTS THAT CAME IN FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE LOOKED UPON HER WHEN THEY HAD MET HER IF SHE HAD BEEN LEFT POOR
CAN YOU TELL WHERE THAT IS
WOULD TO GOD YOU WOULD LEAVE THAT TRICK OF MAKING EXCUSES
EXPECT TO BE SOUNDLY CHIDDEN
THE BRIDE IS TAKEN DANGEROUSLY ILL SO DANGEROUSLY ILL THAT THE DOCTORS REJOICE WHEN THE DISEASE PRONOUNCES ITSELF TO BE SMALL-POX
I REMEMBER SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN THAT EVER I TOOK NOTICE OF FOR EXTREMELY HANDSOME
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW KINDLY I TAKE IT THAT YOU FORGIVE MY BROTHER AND LET ME ASSURE YOU I SHALL NEVER PRESS YOU TO ANYTHING UNREASONABLE
WE ARE GOT RID OF THE WORKMEN NOW AND OUR HOUSE IS READY TO ENTERTAIN YOU
A CARRIAGE WAS OFTEN TAKEN TO PIECES AT CONWAY AND CARRIED TO THE MENAI STRAITS ON THE PEASANTS SHOULDERS ROUND THE DANGEROUS CLIFF OF PENMAENMAWR
VISITING
ONE WONDERS WHAT HAS BECOME OF JOHN OWEN'S LEGACY
TIS CONFEST
HE SAW NOTHING OF THE DUTCH FLEET IN GOING OVER BUT ON HIS RETURN HE FELL IN WITH IT AND FIRED WITHOUT WARNING AND CEREMONY INTO THE SHIPS THAT WERE NEXT HIM
BUT AS FAST AS THEY RUN THEY STAY THERE SO LONG AS IF THEY WANTED NOT TO FINISH THE RACE FOR IT IS USUAL HERE TO FIND SOME OF THE YOUNG COMPANY TILL MIDNIGHT AND THE THICKETS OF THE GARDEN SEEM TO BE CONTRIVED TO ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF GALLANTRY AFTER THEY HAVE REFRESHED WITH THE COLLATION WHICH IS HERE SELDOM OMITTED AT A CERTAIN CABARET IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PARADISE WHERE THE FORBIDDEN FRUITS ARE CERTAIN TRIFLING TARTS NEATS TONGUES SALACIOUS MEATS AND BAD RHENISH FOR WHICH THE GALLANTS PAY SAUCE AS INDEED THEY DO AT ALL SUCH HOUSES THROUGHOUT ENGLAND
WHEN DOROTHY SAYS SHE WILL SIT LIKE THE LADY OF THE LOBSTER AND GIVE AUDIENCE AT BABRAM SHE SIMPLY MEANS THAT SHE WILL SIT AMONG MAGNIFICENT SURROUNDINGS UNSUITED TO HER MODEST DISPOSITION
MY LADY DEVONSHIRE WAS CHRISTIAN DAUGHTER OF LORD BRUCE OF KINLOSS
WHO TOLD YOU I GO TO BED LATE
TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS AT THE RESTORATION HE CAME TO LIVE AT SPINNEY ABBEY NEAR ISHAM CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND DIED ON THE 23RD OF MARCH 1673
THAT IS TO DOUBT IT IS NOT AS GREAT ALREADY AS IT CAN BE THAN WHICH YOU CANNOT DO ME A GREATER INJURY
AND YET WITH ALL MY GRAVITY I COULD NOT BUT LAUGH AT YOUR ENCOUNTER IN THE PARK THOUGH I WAS NOT PLEASED THAT YOU SHOULD LEAVE A FAIR LADY AND GO LIE UPON THE COLD GROUND
AND THE SEALS WERE SOME REMAINDERS THAT SHOWED HIS FATHER'S LOVE TO ANTIQUITIES AND THEREFORE COST HIM DEAR ENOUGH IF THAT WOULD MAKE THEM GOOD
FOR AMIDST ITS OLD-FASHIONED PIETY THERE ARE MANY SENTIMENTS OF PRACTICAL GOODNESS EXPRESSED WITH CLEAR INSISTENCE COMBINED WITH A QUAINT GRACE OF LITERARY STYLE WHICH WE HAVE LONG AGO CAST ASIDE IN THE PURSUIT OF OTHER THINGS
HIS HUMOUR WAS VERY GOOD I BELIEVE BEFORE THAT ACCIDENT FOR HE WILL YET SAY THINGS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TIS SO SELDOM THAT HE SPEAKS AT ALL AND WHEN HE DOES TIS WITH SO SOBER A LOOK THAT ONE MAY SEE HE IS NOT MOVED AT ALL HIMSELF WHEN HE DIVERTS THE COMPANY MOST
I COULD NOT IMAGINE HIM SO VERY A BEAST AS TO THINK HIS HORSES WERE TO BE SERV'D BEFORE ME AND THEREFORE WAS PRESENTLY STRUCK WITH AN APPREHENSION HE HAD NO LETTER FOR ME
BUT PASSION GIVES A STRENGTH ABOVE NATURE WE SEE IT IN MAD PEOPLE
THAT WHICH I MOST OWN IS MY FATHER'S ILL-HEALTH WHICH THOUGH IT BE NOT IN THAT EXTREMITY IT HAS BEEN YET KEEPS HIM STILL A PRISONER IN HIS CHAMBER AND FOR THE MOST PART TO HIS BED WHICH IS REASON ENOUGH
OF SIR PETER HIMSELF WE HAD AT ONE TIME THOUGHT TO WRITE AT SOME LENGTH
BUT YET I WOULD NOT BE THOUGHT SO INCONSIDERATE A PERSON AS NOT TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS EXPECTED FROM ALL PEOPLE THAT HAVE SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD ACT WITH REASON THAT TO ALL PERSONS SOME PROPORTION OF FORTUNE IS NECESSARY ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL QUALITIES AND THOUGH IT IS NOT REQUIRED THAT ONE SHOULD TIE ONESELF TO JUST SO MUCH AND SOMETHING IS LEFT FOR ONE'S INCLINATION AND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PERSONS TO MAKE YET STILL WITHIN SUCH A COMPASS,--AND SUCH AS LAY MORE UPON THESE CONSIDERATIONS THAN THEY WILL BEAR SHALL INFALLIBLY BE CONDEMNED BY ALL SOBER PERSONS
YET YOU WILL SAY I TAKE GREAT PAINS TO PRESERVE IT AS ILL AS I LIKE IT
SPRING GARDENS WAS ENCLOSED AND LAID OUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I
FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT SAY SHE HAS THE SPLEEN I SHALL HATE IT WORSE THAN EVER I DID NOR THAT IT IS A DISEASE OF THE WITS I SHALL THINK YOU ABUSE ME FOR THEN I AM SURE IT WOULD NOT BE MINE
MY LADY HER MOTHER IN GREAT KINDNESS WOULD HAVE RECOMMENDED HENINGHAM TO ME AND TOLD ME IN A COMPLIMENT THAT I WAS FITTER FOR HIM THAN HER DAUGHTER WHO WAS YOUNGER AND THEREFORE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD SO WELL
AND YET I MAY DESERVE YOURS WHEN I SHALL HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BESIDES ALL THAT YOU SPEAK OF I HAVE GOTTEN AN AGUE THAT WITH TWO FITS HAS MADE ME SO VERY WEAK THAT I DOUBTED EXTREMELY YESTERDAY WHETHER I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIT UP TO-DAY TO WRITE TO YOU
TIS A CIVIL WELL-NATURED MAN AS CAN BE OF EXCELLENT PRINCIPLES AND EXACT HONESTY
YET PERHAPS I HAVE NO REASON AND IT MAY BE AS WELL A WANT OF SENSE IN ME AS OF PASSION
HE REMEMBERED TOO WELL THE LETTERS I WRIT UPON OUR LAST UNHAPPY DIFFERENCES AND WOULD NOT TRUST ME FROM HIM IN SUCH ANOTHER OCCASION
WERE THERE EVER SUCH STORIES AS THESE YOU TELL
IF I REMEMBER ANYBODY TIS AGAINST MY WILL
MY FATHER HAS LOST HIS TOO AND MY ELDEST BROTHER BUT WE ALL LOOK LIKE PEOPLE RISEN FROM THE DEAD
THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR FETTERS AS INCONSIDERATELY AS A WOODCOCK RUNS INTO A NOOSE AND ARE CARRIED BY THE WEAKEST CONSIDERATIONS IMAGINABLE TO DO A THING OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE OF ANYTHING THAT CONCERNS THIS WORLD
MEANWHILE LADY OSBORNE--DOROTHY WITH HER IN ALL PROBABILITY--WAS DOING HER BEST TO VICTUAL THE CASTLE FROM THE MAINLAND SHE LIVING AT ST MALO DURING THE SIEGE
YOU SAY YOU ARE OFTEN INTERRUPTED AND I BELIEVE IT
WE KNOW THAT IN THE END IT COMES TO NOTHING
AND BY THE MALICE OF HIS NEIGHBOUR GEORGE CARTERET GOVERNOR OF JERSEY WHO HIMSELF MADE FREE WITH THE GUERNSEY SUPPLIES WHILE WRITING HOME TO THE KING THAT SIR PETER HAS BETRAYED HIS TRUST
THIS LETTER ALSO IS DATED AND FROM THIS TIME FORTH THERE IS LESS TROUBLE IN ARRANGING THE LETTERS IN ORDER OF DATE AS MANY OF THEM HAVE AT LEAST THE DAY OF THE MONTH IF NOTHING MORE
YOU MEANER BEAUTIES OF THE NIGHT THAT POORLY SATISFY OUR EYES MORE BY YOUR NUMBER THAN YOUR LIGHT YOU COMMON PEOPLE OF THE SKIES WHAT ARE YOU WHEN THE SUN SHALL RISE
BUT WHO COULD EXPECT BETTER FROM A LOVE BEGUN UPON SUCH GROUNDS
COOPER AND HOSKINS WERE FAMOUS MINIATURE PAINTERS OF THE DAY
AND IF IT BE WHAT IS BECOME OF THE L2500 LADY
THERE I SPENT THE LATTER END OF THE SUMMER AND AT MY COMING HOME FOUND THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS SOME ESTATE IN THIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN TREATING WITH MY BROTHER AND IT YET GOES ON FAIR AND SOFTLY
YOU MAY DO SO IF YOU PLEASE THOUGH I KNOW NOT TO WHAT END
I AM ASKING THAT BEFORE YOU ARE AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END
BUT CERTAINLY I KNOW WHAT AN ESTATE IS
I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER OF THE 10TH OF THIS MONTH
HE APPEARS TO HAVE PROPOSED TO HER MORE THAN ONCE AND EVIDENTLY HAD HER BROTHER'S GOOD OFFICES WHICH I FEAR WERE NOT MUCH IN HIS FAVOUR WITH DOROTHY
WHY DO YOU SAY I FAILED YOU
I ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS VERY SERIOUSLY
THEY SAY ONE IS SO TO ALL THAT ONE DESIRES
AND SOME SAY MY LORD RICH AND MY LADY BETTY HOWARD BUT OTHERS THAT PRETEND TO KNOW MORE SAY HIS COURT TO HER IS BUT TO COUNTENANCE A MORE SERIOUS ONE TO MRS HOWARD HER SISTER-IN-LAW HE NOT HAVING COURAGE TO PRETEND SO OPENLY AS SOME DO TO ANOTHER'S WIFE
YET I CANNOT SAY THAT HE IS AT ALL SICK BUT HAS SO GENERAL A WEAKNESS UPON HIM THAT I AM MUCH AFRAID THEIR OPINION OF HIM HAS TOO MUCH OF TRUTH IN IT AND DO EXTREMELY APPREHEND HOW THE WINTER MAY WORK UPON HIM
HE WAS SO NEAR AS HE THOUGHT AT LEAST MARRYING MRS GERHERD THAT ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE GOT HIS WHOLE ESTATE IN WAGERS UPON'T THAT WOULD HAVE VENTURED BUT A REASONABLE PROPORTION OF THEIR OWN
BUT IT MUST BE SO AND I MUST EVER BE SUBJECT TO OTHER PEOPLE'S OCCASIONS AND SO NEVER I THINK MASTER OF MY OWN
ALL WHO HAD GOOD PRINCIPLES AND INCLINATIONS WERE ENCOURAGED IN THEM AND SUCH AS HAD NEITHER WERE FORCED TO PUT ON A HANDSOME DISGUISE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE OUT OF COUNTENANCE AT THEMSELVES
THE ELDERLY MAN WHO PROPOSED TO DOROTHY WAS SIR JUSTINIAN ISHAM BART OF LAMPORT IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
HERE WAS MR FREEMAN YESTERDAY THAT MADE ME A VERY KIND VISIT AND SAID SO MANY FINE THINGS TO ME THAT I WAS CONFOUNDED WITH HIS CIVILITIES AND HAD NOTHING TO SAY FOR MYSELF
SOLD BY EBEN TRACY AT THE THREE BIBLES ON LONDON BRIDGE POLEXANDER WAS DONE INTO ENGLISH BY WILLIAM BROWNE GENT FOR THE BENEFIT AND BEHOOF OF THE EARL OF PEMBROKE
TIS BUT REASONABLE AS YOU SAY THAT YOU SHOULD SEE ME AND YET I KNOW NOT NOW HOW IT CAN WELL BE
TIS UNKINDLY DONE
HE WOULD NOT OFFER SURE TO MAKE US BELIEVE MY LADY JANE A LOVELIER PERSON THAN MY LADY ANNE PERCY
FOR TO WHAT PURPOSE SHOULD I HAVE STRIVED AGAINST IT
IT MUST BE ALLOWED THAT THE TURN OF MIND WHICH THE EULOGISTS OF TEMPLE HAVE DIGNIFIED WITH THE APPELLATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL INDIFFERENCE AND WHICH HOWEVER BECOMING IT MAY BE IN AN OLD AND EXPERIENCED STATESMAN HAS A SOMEWHAT UNGRACEFUL APPEARANCE IN YOUTH MIGHT EASILY APPEAR SHOCKING TO A FAMILY WHO WERE READY TO FIGHT OR TO SUFFER MARTYRDOM FOR THEIR EXILED KING AND THEIR PERSECUTED CHURCH
TWAS INNOCENT ENOUGH IN ME THAT RESOLVED NEVER TO MARRY AND WOULD HAVE KEPT ME COMPANY IN THIS SOLITARY PLACE AS LONG AS I LIVED WITHOUT BEING A TROUBLE TO MYSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE
NOBODY THAT IS AT CAMBRIDGE SCAPES IT
AND THOUGH AS TO HIMSELF IT WAS AN INFINITE MERCY IN GOD ALMIGHTY TO TAKE HIM OUT OF A WORLD THAT CAN BE PLEASING TO NONE AND WAS MADE MORE UNEASY TO HIM BY MANY INFIRMITIES THAT WERE UPON HIM YET TO ME IT IS AN AFFLICTION MUCH GREATER THAN PEOPLE JUDGE IT
AND I CANNOT BUT TELL HIM SOMETIMES THAT SURE HE MISTAKES AND SENDS ME LETTERS THAT WERE MEANT TO HIS MISTRESS TILL HE SWEARS TO ME THAT HE HAS NONE
LET US TRY NOW AND PICTURE FOR OURSELVES THEIR HOME
AFTER HER FATHER'S DEATH SHE TOOK THE TITLE OF COUNTESS OF DYSART ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME DISPUTE ABOUT THE RIGHT OF HER FATHER TO ANY TITLE
YET I COULD BEAT YOU FOR WRITING THIS LAST STRANGE LETTER
DR SMITH THAT TOOK IT IS DEAD ALREADY
TIS MOST CERTAIN I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN A HANDSOME CHAIN TO LEAD MY APES IN BEFORE SUCH A HUSBAND
BUT THE COMPANY WALK IN IT AT SUCH A RATE AS YOU WOULD THINK ALL THE LADIES WERE SO MANY ATALANTAS CONTENDING WITH THEIR WOOERS AND MY LORD THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE THAT I SHOULD PROVE THE HIPPOMENES WHO COULD WITH VERY MUCH ADO KEEP PACE WITH THEM
WHEN YOUR FATHER GOES INTO IRELAND LAY YOUR COMMANDS UPON SOME OF HIS SERVANTS TO GET YOU AN IRISH GREYHOUND
ETC
NO METHODISM ABOUT THE SQUARE WINDOWS SET HERE AND THERE AT UNDECIDED INTERVALS WHERESOEVER THEY MAY BE WANTED
HERE TOO WE FIND WHAT MACAULAY LONGED FOR--THOSE SOCIAL DOMESTIC TRIVIALITIES WHICH THE HISTORIANS HAVE AT LENGTH BEGUN TO VALUE RIGHTLY
IF WITH THESE DIRECTIONS YOU CAN FIND IT OUT YOU WILL THERE FIND ONE THAT IS VERY MUCH YOUR SERVANT
THE BEST ON'T IS THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR THOUGH I CONFESS I HAD RATHER NOBODY KNEW IT YET TIS THAT I SHALL NEVER BE ASHAMED TO OWN
AND LOOK THAT YOU GIVE ME AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF ONE AS I SHALL GIVE YOU OF T'OTHER
OF ALL THE COMPANY THIS PLACE IS STORED WITH THERE IS BUT TWO PERSONS WHOSE CONVERSATION IS AT ALL EASY
THE SPITEFUL MAN MERELY TO VEX ME HAS GONE AND MARRIED MY COUNTRYWOMAN MY LORD LEE'S DAUGHTER
AND TO SAY TRUTH I KNOW NOT WHETHER I SHALL FROM ANYBODY ELSE IF TO LEARN THEM BE TO UNDERSTAND THEM
YRS
I CONFESS I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR OUR FAISEURS DE ROMANCE WHEN THEY MAKE A WOMAN COURT
I TOLD THEM I KNEW NO REMEDY BUT LEAVING ME BEHIND NEXT TIME AND COULD HAVE TOLD THEM THAT MY LOOKS WERE SUITABLE TO MY FORTUNE THOUGH NOT TO A FEAST
PERHAPS SHE HAS
BUT YOUR FORTUNE AND MINE CAN NEVER AGREE AND IN PLAIN TERMS WE FORFEIT OUR DISCRETIONS AND RUN WILFULLY UPON OUR OWN RUINS IF THERE BE SUCH A THOUGHT
NOR DO I THINK SHE HAD SO MUCH ADDRESS AS TO DO IT MERELY IN COMPLIMENT TO ME
I DO NOT FIND THOUGH THAT THEY HAVE ALTERED ME YET
THE WHOLE IS VERY LONG AND IS A DESCRIPTION OF OR RATHER A PARAPHRASE UPON THE FRIENDSHIP OF DAVID AND JONATHAN
AND PERHAPS IF YOU COULD READ MY HEART I SHOULD MAKE LESS SCRUPLE OF YOUR SEEING ON'T THERE THAN IN MY LETTERS
WHAT WOULD I GIVE I COULD AVOID IT WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK OF YOU
AND SERIOUSLY I FIND I WANT COURAGE TO MARRY WHERE I DO NOT LIKE
SIR THOMAS OSBORNE A YORKSHIRE BARONET AFTERWARDS EARL OF DANBY IS A NAME NOT UNKNOWN IN HISTORY
TO THIS MY LADY ANSWERED AGAIN FOR ME THAT TWAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT I MIGHT DO SO BUT IN THAT POINT SHE THOUGHT ME NICE AND CURIOUS ENOUGH
HE MUST NOT BE A THING THAT BEGAN THE WORLD IN A FREE SCHOOL WAS SENT FROM THENCE TO THE UNIVERSITY AND IS AT HIS FURTHEST WHEN HE REACHES THE INNS OF COURT HAS NO ACQUAINTANCE BUT THOSE OF HIS FORM IN THESE PLACES SPEAKS THE FRENCH HE HAS PICKED OUT OF OLD LAWS AND ADMIRES NOTHING BUT THE STORIES HE HAS HEARD OF THE REVELS THAT WERE KEPT THERE BEFORE HIS TIME
BUT I WILL SEND YOU THAT WHICH WAS TO CURE ME
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL I HAVE SAID CANNOT OBLIGE YOU TO A CARE OF YOURSELF
IT WAS THE MOST SUBLIME NONSENSE THAT IN MY LIFE I EVER READ
I HAVE HAD LADIES WITH ME ALL THE AFTERNOON THAT ARE FOR LONDON TO-MORROW AND NOW I HAVE AS MANY LETTERS TO WRITE AS MY LORD GENERAL'S SECRETARY
IF YOU WERE NOT SO APT TO QUARREL I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOUR JOURNEY GOES FORWARDER BUT YOU WOULD PRESENTLY IMAGINE THAT TIS BECAUSE I WOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WERE GONE
LORD PEMBROKE ON THE OTHER HAND ACCORDING TO CLARENDON PRETENDED TO NO OTHER QUALIFICATION THAN TO UNDERSTAND HORSES AND DOGS VERY WELL AND TO BE BELIEVED HONEST AND GENEROUS HIS STABLES VIED WITH PALACES AND HIS FALCONRY WAS FURNISHED AT IMMENSE EXPENSE
WHAT SHALL I TELL HIM
SOMETIMES WE SEE THEE FULLY AND CAN SAY FROM HENCE THOU TOOK'ST THY RISE AND WENT'ST THAT WAY BUT OFT'NER THE SHORT BEAMS OF REASON'S EYE SEE ONLY THERE THOU ART NOT HOW NOR WHY
WHEN I DO YOU SHALL KNOW IT
BESIDES I WAS NOT SO CERTAIN OF HIS NATURE AS NOT TO DOUBT WHETHER SHE MIGHT NOT CORRUPT IT NOR SO CONFIDENT OF HIS KINDNESS AS TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT IT WOULD LAST LONGER THAN OTHER PEOPLE OF HIS AGE AND HUMOUR
IF YOU HEAR OF HER SEND ME WORD HOW SHE MAKES A SHIFT THERE
SURE I SHALL NOT FIND FAULT WITH YOUR WRITING IN HASTE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF YOUR LETTER
I SHALL TELL YOU MY REASON WHEN YOU COME
NO I FEAR NOBODY'S ANGER
NOW DO BUT YOU JUDGE WHETHER IF BY MISCHANCE HE SHOULD DISCOVER THE TRUTH WHETHER HE WOULD NOT RAIL MOST SWEETLY AT ME AND WITH SOME REASON FOR ABUSING HIM
TWAS ARUNDEL HOWARD
HE WAS THE INCARNATION OF THE MALIGNANT OF LATTER-DAY FICTION
YOU ARE NOT SO HANDSOME AS WILL SPENCER NOR I HAVE NOT SO MUCH COURAGE NOR WEALTH AS HIS MISTRESS NOR SHE HAS NOT SO MUCH AS HER AUNT SAYS BY ALL THE MONEY
AS FOR EXAMPLE MY BROTHER PEYTON HAS SENT TO ME FOR A COUNTRYMAN OF HIS SIR JOHN TUFTON,--HE MARRIED ONE OF MY LADY WOTTON'S HEIRS WHO IS LATELY DEAD,--AND TO INVITE ME TO THINK OF IT
ALL THIS I CAN SAY TO YOU
OF HER KINDNESS TO COMPTON OF WHICH DOROTHY WRITES IN HER NEXT LETTER NOTHING IS KNOWN BUT SHE MARRIED CHARLES PAULET LORD ST JOHN AFTERWARDS THE DUKE OF BOLTON EARLY IN 1654
I'LL SWEAR HER FRIENDS ARE MUCH TO BLAME TO LET HER GO ABROAD
IN THE MIDST OF OUR PLAY IN COMES MY BLESSED BOY WITH YOUR LETTER AND IN EARNEST I WAS NOT ABLE TO DISGUISE THE JOY IT GAVE ME THOUGH ONE WAS BY THAT IS NOT MUCH YOUR FRIEND AND TOOK NOTICE OF A BLUSH THAT FOR MY LIFE I COULD NOT KEEP BACK
MY LADY HAS WRIT ME WORD THAT SHE INTENDS VERY SHORTLY TO SIT AT LELY'S FOR HER PICTURE FOR ME
THE TOWN MUST NEEDS BE UNPLEASANT NOW AND METHINKS YOU MIGHT CONTRIVE SOME WAY OF HAVING YOUR LETTERS SENT TO YOU WITHOUT GIVING YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF COMING TO TOWN FOR THEM WHEN YOU HAVE NO OTHER BUSINESS
THE PHRASE IS THRICE USED BY SHAKESPEARE AND CONSTANTLY OCCURS IN THE OLD BURLESQUES AND COMEDIES
BUT I AM CHIEFLY OF YOUR OPINION THAT CONTENTMENT WHICH THE SPANISH PROVERB SAYS IS THE BEST PAINT GIVES THE LUSTRE TO ALL ONE'S ENJOYMENT PUTS A BEAUTY UPON THINGS WHICH WITHOUT IT WOULD HAVE NONE INCREASES IT EXTREMELY WHERE TIS ALREADY IN SOME DEGREE AND WITHOUT IT ALL THAT WE CALL HAPPINESS BESIDES LOSES ITS PROPERTY
TIS I THINK THE BEST I HAVE SEEN OF HIS AND I LIKE THE SUBJECT BECAUSE TIS THAT I WOULD BE PERFECT IN
AND THE REST OF HIS EARLY LIFE WITH AN ACCOUNT OF HIS MEETING WITH DOROTHY HAS BEEN ALREADY SET DOWN FOR US BY MACAULAY
IN 1651 HE WAS ELECTED A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND IN THIS SITUATION HE CONTINUED TO ACT UNTIL 1653
AND BECAUSE OTHERS JUDGE US WITH MORE SEVERITY THAN OUR INDULGENCE TO OURSELVES WILL PERMIT IT MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT TIS SAFER BEING RULED BY THEIR OPINIONS THAN BY OUR OWN
BUT YET I THINK I SHALL NOT GO
TO ANOTHER PERSON I SHOULD JUSTIFY MYSELF THAT TIS NOT A LIGHTNESS IN MY NATURE NOR ANY INTEREST THAT IS NOT COMMON TO US BOTH THAT HAS WROUGHT THIS CHANGE IN ME
GUIZOT THEN QUOTES A LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 19 1653 ANNOUNCING THE NEWS OF GENERAL MONK'S MARRIAGE AND THIS WOULD ABOUT CORRESPOND WITH THE PRESUMED DATE OF DOROTHY'S LETTER
IN 1643 HE IS IN PRISON CHARGED AMONG OTHER THINGS WITH BEING A MALIGNANT
AND IF YOU MEET WITH ONE BRITTOMART PRAY SEND ME WORD HOW YOU LIKE HIM
I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT MIGHT BE THE CARRIER'S FAULT IN CHANGING HIS TIME WITHOUT GIVING NOTICE BUT HE ASSURES ME HE DID TO NAN
HIS LITERARY WORK WAS AT LEAST COPIOUS AND INCLUDED SOME HISTORICAL WRITING AS WELL AS THE TRANSLATIONS MENTIONED BY DOROTHY
NOTHING EVER CAN PERSUADE ME TO ENTER THE WORLD AGAIN
TWAS JUST UPON HIS GOING UP TO TOWN AND PERHAPS HE THOUGHT IT NOT FIT TO PART IN ANGER
WHEN MACAULAY WAS REVIEWING COURTENAY'S BOOK IN THE EDINBURGH REVIEW HE TOOK OCCASION TO WRITE A SHORT BUT LIVING SKETCH OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE AND DOROTHY OSBORNE
I SHALL NEED NOTHING BUT MY OWN HEART TO FORTIFY ME IN THIS RESOLUTION AND DESIRE NOTHING IN RETURN OF IT BUT THAT YOUR CARE OF YOURSELF MAY ANSWER TO THAT WHICH I SHALL ALWAYS HAVE FOR YOUR INTERESTS
NOR A TRAVELLED MONSIEUR WHOSE HEAD IS ALL FEATHER INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THAT CAN TALK OF NOTHING BUT DANCES AND DUETS AND HAS COURAGE ENOUGH TO WEAR SLASHES WHEN EVERY ONE ELSE DIES WITH COLD TO SEE HIM
CHAPTER IV DESPONDENCY
MY ELDEST BROTHER IS NOT SO INQUISITIVE
HE GOES ON MONDAY OR TUESDAY AT FARTHEST
TWENTY SUCH STORIES AS THESE SHE TELLS
HE HAD FOUR DAUGHTERS AND IT IS ONE OF DOROTHY'S FAVOURITE JESTS TO OFFER TEMPLE A MOTHER-IN-LAW'S GOOD WORD IF HE WILL PAY COURT TO ONE OF THEM WHEN SHE HAS MARRIED THE EMPEROR SIR,--SINCE YOU ARE SO EASY TO PLEASE SURE I SHALL NOT MISS IT AND IF MY IDLE DREAMS AND THOUGHTS WILL SATISFY YOU I AM TO BLAME IF YOU WANT LONG LETTERS
AND WHEN HE WANTS SOMETHING TO ENTERTAIN HIS COMPANY WITHAL HE CALLS TO HER FOR IT
I WOULD HAVE HAD ONE DRAWN SINCE I CAME AND CONSULTED MY GLASS EVERY MORNING WHEN TO BEGIN
NO IN EARNEST ANYTHING OF GOOD COMES TO ME LIKE THE SUN TO THE INHABITANTS OF GREENLAND IT RAISES THEM TO LIFE WHEN THEY SEE IT AND WHEN THEY MISS IT IT IS NOT STRANGE THEY EXPECT A NIGHT OF HALF A YEAR LONG
HIS SEAT WAS AT KNOWLTON IN THE COUNTY OF KENT
I REMEMBER I WAS FORBID IT AND METHOUGHT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF REASON FOR ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE WELL IS SO LOW AND THERE IS SUCH A MULTITUDE TO BE SERVED OUT ON'T THAT YOU CAN HARDLY GET ANY BUT WHAT IS THICK AND TROUBLED
ADIEU MY DEAREST
BUT YOU WERE CRUEL YOURSELF WHEN YOU SEEMED TO APPREHEND I MIGHT OBLIGE YOU TO MAKE GOOD YOUR LAST OFFER
FAREWELL
FAREWELL
FAREWELL
WERE IT NOT BETTER THAT I HAD NOTHING TO SAY NEITHER THAN THAT I SHOULD ENTERTAIN YOU WITH SUCH SENSELESS THINGS
BUT TIS NO MATTER TIS NOT MUCH WORTH IT
IN 1643 SHE JOINED THE COURT AT OXFORD AND WAS MADE ONE OF THE MAIDS OF HONOUR TO HENRIETTA MARIA WHOM SHE AFTERWARDS ATTENDED IN EXILE
NAY IN EARNEST IF I COULD HAVE HOPED YOU WOULD BE SO MUCH YOUR OWN FRIEND AS TO SEEK OUT A HAPPINESS IN SOME OTHER PERSON NOTHING UNDER HEAVEN COULD HAVE SATISFIED ME LIKE ENTERTAINING MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT OF HAVING DONE YOU SERVICE IN DIVERTING YOU FROM A TROUBLESOME PURSUIT OF WHAT IS SO UNCERTAIN AND BY THAT GIVING YOU THE OCCASION OF A BETTER FORTUNE
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE TIME I AM TO SPEND HERE FOR IT WITH ALL MY HEART
I AM ABED STILL AND SLEPT SO SOUNDLY NOTHING BUT YOUR LETTER COULD HAVE WAKED ME
AND THAT COUNTRY WHICH USUALLY GIVES PEOPLE A JOLLINESS AND GAIETY THAT IS NATURAL TO THE CLIMATE HAD WROUGHT IN ME SO CONTRARY EFFECTS THAT I WAS AS NEW A THING TO THEM AS MY CLOTHES
COME WHEN YOU PLEASE AND YOU WILL MEET NOBODY MORE GLAD TO SEE YOU THAN YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND DUTIFUL DAUGHTER D
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE OF ANOTHER MIND
I GOT IT IN THE TIME OF MY FAVOUR THERE AND IT WAS ALL THEY HAD
AND YET I WOULD NOT SO WHOLLY HAVE LOST THEM AS SOME WOMEN THAT I KNOW HAS AS MUCH INJURY AS THEY DO ME
I COULD NOT IMAGINE THE REASON ONLY I ASSURED MYSELF IT WAS NO FAULT OF YOURS BUT PERHAPS A JUST PUNISHMENT UPON ME FOR HAVING BEEN TOO MUCH PLEASED IN A COMPANY WHERE YOU WERE NOT
IF SO HIS TITLE GOES WITH IT I THINK
AND PLAYING THE BORE NOT A LITTLE I SHOULD FEAR WITH HIS GOSSIP AND IMAGINARY AILMENTS
THAT'S BUT SMALL COMFORT THOUGH YOU'LL SAY
I AM AT THAT PASS NOW
SIR,--YOU HAVE FURNISHED ME NOW WITH ARGUMENTS TO CONVINCE MY BROTHER IF HE SHOULD EVER ENTER ON THE DISPUTE AGAIN
ROBIN C
IN MY OPINION THESE GREAT SCHOLARS ARE NOT THE BEST WRITERS OF LETTERS I MEAN
WE CANNOT MISS FITTER TIMES THAN THIS TWENTY IN A YEAR AND I SHALL BE AS READY TO GIVE YOU NOTICE OF SUCH AS YOU CAN BE TO DESIRE IT ONLY YOU WOULD DO ME A GREAT PLEASURE IF YOU COULD FORBEAR WRITING UNLESS IT WERE SOMETIMES ON GREAT OCCASIONS
IN THIS LETTER DOROTHY DESCRIBES SOME HUSBANDS WHOM SHE COULD NOT MARRY
AND STILL TO DISHEARTEN HIM THE MORE SHE TOOK OCCASION UPON HIS NAMING SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE COUNTY THAT HAD BEEN TALKED OF HERETOFORE AS OF MY SERVANTS AND ARE SINCE DISPOSED OF TO SAY VERY PLAINLY THAT TWAS TRUE THEY HAD SOME OF THEM PRETENDED BUT THERE WAS AN END OF MY BEDFORDSHIRE SERVANTS SHE WAS SURE THERE WERE NO MORE THAT COULD BE ADMITTED INTO THE NUMBER
AND WITH IT A VERY MODERATE ONE WOULD KEEP ME FROM EVER REPENTING MY DISPOSAL
BUT TO BE SOBER NOW AGAIN FOR GOD'S SAKE SEND ME WORD HOW YOUR JOURNEY GOES FORWARD WHEN YOU THINK YOU SHALL BEGIN IT AND HOW LONG IT MAY LAST WHEN I MAY EXPECT YOUR COMING THIS WAY
AND TO SPEAK INDIFFERENTLY THERE ARE SUCH MULTITUDES THAT ABUSE THE NAMES OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP AND SO VERY FEW THAT EITHER UNDERSTAND OR PRACTISE IT IN REALITY THAT IT MAY RAISE GREAT DOUBTS WHETHER THERE IS ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORLD OR NOT AND SUCH AS DO NOT FIND IT IN THEMSELVES WILL HARDLY BELIEVE TIS ANYWHERE
WHETHER HARROLD OR COLLINS THE TWO CARRIERS WERE EITHER OR BOTH OF THEM GUILTY OF CARELESSNESS IN THE DELIVERY OF THESE LETTERS IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY NOW
IF I WERE YOURS FROM THIS MINUTE I COULD NOT RECOMPENSE WHAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE VIOLENCE OF YOUR PASSION THOUGH I WERE ALL THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE ME WHEN GOD KNOWS I AM AN INCONSIDERABLE PERSON BORN TO A THOUSAND MISFORTUNES WHICH HAVE TAKEN AWAY ALL SENSE OF ANYTHING ELSE FROM ME AND LEFT ME A WALKING MISERY ONLY
IT IS PROBABLE THAT PARTIES MIGHT AND DID ADD A VOLUNTARY RELIGIOUS RITE TO THIS COMPULSORY CIVIL CEREMONY AS IS DONE AT THIS DAY IN MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES
PETER OSBORNE DIED IN 1592
IMMEDIATELY UPON THE VILLAINOUS ASSASSINATION THEY INTENDED TO HAVE PROCLAIMED CHARLES STUART BY THE ASSISTANCE OF A TUMULT ETC
I HAVE HEARD NO MORE OF HIM THOUGH I HAVE SEEN HIM SINCE
BUT THAT WILL NEVER BE AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE THE SAME I AM
AFTER RESIDING AT CAMBRIDGE TWO YEARS HE DEPARTED WITHOUT TAKING A DEGREE AND SET OUT UPON HIS TRAVELS
BUT IS IT NOT TRUE TOO THAT YOU HAVE REPRESENTED ME TO HIM RATHER AS YOU IMAGINE ME THAN AS I AM
SOON AFTER THIS AND IN THE YEAR OF THE RESTORATION SHE DIED SUDDENLY
HOW IDLY I TALK
TEMPLE'S FATHER WAS AT THIS TIME TRYING TO ARRANGE A MATCH FOR HIM WITH A CERTAIN MRS CH
FOR GOD'S SAKE DO TAKE ANY COURSE THAT MAY MAKE YOU HAPPY
I KNOW TOO WELL THAT OUR FORTUNES HAVE GIVEN US OCCASION ENOUGH TO COMPLAIN AND TO BE WEARY OF HER TYRANNY
YOUR JOURNEY CANNOT BE TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE NEITHER
IT MAY BE I DREAMT IT THAT YOU HAD MET MY BROTHER OR ELSE IT WAS ONE OF THE REVERIES OF MY AGUE
HOWEVER I AM GLAD I HAVE THEM AND MUCH THE MORE BECAUSE IT DISPENSES WITH A VERY UNFIT EMPLOYMENT THAT YOUR FATHER OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO YOU AND HIS CIVILITY TO ME WAS CONTENT TO TAKE UPON HIM
I CANNOT FIND ANY ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT SHOP ABOVE THE EXCHANGE THE FLOWER POTT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE FLOWER POTS IN LONDON AT THIS TIME ONE IN LEADENHALL STREET AND ANOTHER IN ST JAMES MARKET
PUT IT IN SOME CORNER WHERE NO EYES MAY FIND IT OUT BUT YOURS TO WHOM IT IS ONLY INTENDED
THAT IS FULL AS BAD AS OVERHEATING YOURSELF AT TENNIS AND THEREFORE REMEMBER TIS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU ARE FORBIDDEN
ONE THING MORE I MUST TELL YOU WHICH IS THAT YOU ARE NOT TO TAKE IT ILL THAT I MISTOOK YOUR AGE BY MY COMPUTATION OF YOUR JOURNEY THROUGH THIS COUNTRY
IN THE EARL OF LEICESTER'S JOURNAL UNDER DATE THURSDAY JULY 8TH 1652 WE FIND:--"MY DAUGHTER SPENCER WAS MARRIED TO SIR ROBERT SMITH AT PENSHURST MY WIFE BEING PRESENT WITH MY DAUGHTERS STRANGFORD AND LACY PELHAM ALGERNON AND ROBIN SYDNEY ETC
THE LATTER A HUGE FOLIO OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLOSELY-PRINTED PAGES
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
ALL THAT I AIM AT IS BUT TO KEEP MYSELF FROM PROVING A BEAST
NOBODY ELSE WILL UNDERGO THE CHARGE BECAUSE THEY NEVER HOPE TO SELL ENOUGH OF THEM TO PAY THEMSELVES WITHAL
I CANNOT GUESS AT IT UNLESS IT WERE THAT YOU REPENTED YOU TOLD ME SO MUCH OF YOUR STORY WHICH I AM NOT APT TO BELIEVE NEITHER BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BECOME OUR FRIENDSHIP A GREAT PART OF IT CONSISTING AS I HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IN A MUTUAL CONFIDENCE
IT IS NOT HOWEVER AN UNFAIR EXAMPLE OF LADY NEWCASTLE'S FANTASTIC STYLE
WHAT AN UNHAPPY PERSON AM I
BUT SURE SHE CAN HAVE LOST NO BEAUTY FOR I NEVER SAW ANY THAT SHE HAD BUT GOOD BLACK EYES WHICH CANNOT ALTER
BUT IF YOU SHOULD DENY THE ONLY HOPE THAT'S LEFT ME I MUST BEG YOU WILL DEFER IT TILL CHRISTMAS DAY BE PAST
THE BEST ON'T IS TWILL BE NO GREAT LOSS TO YOU IF YOU DO NOT FOR SURE THE GREATEST PART ON'T IS NOT SENSE AND YET ON MY CONSCIENCE I SHALL GO ON WITH IT
I KNOW NOTHING YOU HAVE LOST AND AM SURE YOU HAVE GAINED A FRIEND THAT IS CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF FRIENDSHIP YOU CAN PROPOUND THAT HAS ALREADY GIVEN AN ENTIRE HEART FOR THAT WHICH SHE RECEIVED AND TIS NO MORE IN HER WILL THAN IN HER POWER EVER TO RECALL IT OR DIVIDE IT
IS IT TRUE
IS IT TRUE
IN EARNEST THEY DO ME WRONG
THIS SPRING WAS AFTERWARDS IN THE YEAR 1677 ENDOWED BY ONE JOHN OWEN WHO LEFT THE SUM OF L1 TO KEEP THE WELL IN REPAIR AS LONG AS IT SHOULD BE OF SERVICE TO THE PARISH TOWARDS THE END OF LAST CENTURY LYSON MENTIONS THAT THE WELL WAS IN DECAY AND LITTLE USED
CHARLES II
AND NOW THE EDITOR FEELS HE MUST AUGMENT MACAULAY'S SKETCH OF DOROTHY OSBORNE WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE OSBORNE FAMILY OF WHOM IT CONSISTED WHAT PART IT TOOK IN THE STRUGGLE OF THE DAY AND WHAT WAS THE PAST POSITION OF DOROTHY'S ANCESTORS
IT WAS THIS PASSAGE FROM MACAULAY THAT LED THE EDITOR TO COURTENAY'S APPENDIX AND IT WAS THE LITERARY AND HUMAN CHARM OF THE LETTERS THEMSELVES THAT SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF STRINGING THEM TOGETHER INTO A CONNECTED STORY OR SKETCH OF THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF DOROTHY OSBORNE
IT IS NOT A PARTICULAR SPOT ON EARTH BUT TO BE BY HIS SIDE WHEREVER THAT MAY BE
I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WHICH IDENTIFIES HIM WITH A SPECIAL PLOT
COMPARE THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE CHAPTER ON CHRISTIAN JUSTICE WITH WHAT DOROTHY HAS WRITTEN IN THIS LETTER
TIS NOT LIKELY AS YOU SAY THAT YOU SHOULD MUCH PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO WHAT YOU DO NOT DESIRE HE SHOULD DO
CAN I KNOW THAT IT WROUGHT SO UPON US BOTH AS TO MAKE NEITHER OF US FRIENDS TO ONE ANOTHER BUT AGREE IN RUNNING WILDLY TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AND THAT PERHAPS OF SOME INNOCENT PERSONS WHO MIGHT LIVE TO CURSE OUR FOLLY THAT GAVE THEM SO MISERABLE A BEING
THE INCLOSURE NOT DISAGREEABLE FOR THE SOLEMNNESS OF THE GROVES THE WARBLING OF THE BIRDS AND AS IT OPENS INTO THE SPACIOUS WALKS OF ST JAMES
TO SPEAK TRUTH IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR NEITHER OF THEM AND IN MEANER PEOPLE HAD BEEN PLAIN UNDOING ONE ANOTHER WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND TO BE KINDNESS OF EITHER SIDE
THE PLOT ITSELF SEEMS TO HAVE CREATED INTENSE EXCITEMENT IN THE CAPITAL AND RESULTED IN THREE PERSONS BEING TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON AND TWO EXECUTED,--JOHN GERARD GENTLEMAN PETER VOWEL SCHOOLMASTER OF ISLINGTON AND ONE SUMMERSET FOX WHO PLEADED GUILTY AND WHOSE LIFE WAS SPARED
FOR WHEN HE WAS AT LEISURE TO TALK HE WOULD SUFFER NO ONE ELSE TO DO IT AND WHAT HE SAID AND THE NOISE HE MADE IF YOU HAD HEARD IT YOU WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED HIM DRUNK WITH JOY THAT HE HAD A WIFE AND A PACK OF HOUNDS
BUT UPON HER HUSBAND'S DEATH SHE MADE UP ALL QUARRELS
THUS DO DOROTHY'S SUITORS ONE BY ONE RECOVER AND CEASE TO LAMENT HER OBDURACY
IN EARNEST TWAS UNKINDLY SAID AND IF I COULD BE ANGRY WITH YOU IT SHOULD BE FOR THAT
THEY SHALL CUT NO LOVE
NOW I AM SPEAKING OF RELIGION LET ME ASK YOU IS NOT HIS NAME BAGSHAWE THAT YOU SAY RAILS ON LOVE AND WOMEN
NO OUT UPON'T
YET THE WOMAN YOU MET UPON THE WAY GOVERNED HER HUSBAND AND DID IT HANDSOMELY
FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1654 VI
THAT WHERESOE'ER IT COMES DESTROYS ALL THAT ENTERTAIN IT
I DON'T DECEIVE MYSELF THUS FAR BUT I WOULD NOT GIVE THEM OCCASION TO SAY THAT I HID MYSELF FROM THEM IN THE DOING IT
NEVERTHELESS EVEN THESE LEAVE US SOME INDIRECT DESCRIPTION OF THEIR TIME FROM WHICH WE CAN LOOK BACK THROUGH THE MIND'S EYE TO THIS YEAR OF GRACE 1653 IN WHICH DOROTHY WAS LIVING AND WRITING
SERIOUSLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT FROM ANOTHER
CHAPTER VI VISITING
IN EARNEST I BELIEVED ALL THIS BEFORE BUT TWAS SOMETHING AN IGNORANT KIND OF FAITH IN ME
BUT A PICTURE IS BUT DULL COMPANY AND THAT YOU NEED NOT
I SPEAK SERIOUSLY HE KEEPS A FRENCHMAN THAT SETS ALL HIS SEALS AND RINGS
STEPHEN MARSHALL WAS LIKE HUGH PETERS ONE OF THOSE PREACHERS WHO WAS ABLE TO EXCHANGE THE OBSCURITY OF A COUNTRY PARISH FOR THE PUBLIC FAME OF A LONDON PULPIT BY REASON OF A CERTAIN GIFT OF RHETORICAL POWER THE VALUE OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE TO-DAY
THINK ON'T
THIS IS IN ALL PROBABILITY THE SIR EDWARD HALES REFERRED TO BY SIR THOMAS PEYTON UNLESS IT BE A SON OF THE SAME NAME
GREENWICH PALACE WAS PROBABLY OCCUPIED BY MONK AT THIS TIME AND DOROTHY MEANT TO SAY THAT ANN CLARGES WOULD BE AS MUCH AT HOME IN GREENWICH PALACE AS SAY THE LORD PROTECTOR'S WIFE AT WHITEHALL
YET I HEAR SHE HAS NOW GOT SOME OF HER OWN LAND IN IRELAND GRANTED HER
THAT HE WAS A PROUD FORMAL WEAK MAN BETWEEN BEING SEDUCED AND A SEDUCER AND THAT HE TOOK IT TO BE A HIGH HONOUR TO SIT ON THE SAME BENCH WITH CROMWELL WHO EMPLOYED HIM AND CONTEMNED HIM AT ONCE
CROMWELL WAS CERTAINLY FOND OF HER AND SHE TOOK CARE TO ENTERTAIN HIM IN IT
BUT HOW THEY WILL LIVE TILL THEN I CANNOT IMAGINE
WELL MY MASTER REMEMBER LAST NIGHT YOU SWAGGERED LIKE A YOUNG LORD
IT IS SO LIKE MY LUCK TOO THAT YOU SHOULD BE GOING I KNOW NOT WHITHER AGAIN
HE WILL MAKE NO STAY I BELIEVE
I HAD NO QUARREL TO HIS PERSON OR HIS FORTUNE BUT WAS IN LOVE WITH NEITHER AND MUCH OUT OF LOVE WITH A THING CALLED MARRIAGE
TIS MUCH EASIER SURE TO GET A GOOD FORTUNE THAN A GOOD HUSBAND
YOUR FATHER WOULD TAKE IT VERY ILL I BELIEVE IF YOU SHOULD PRETEND TO LOVE ME BETTER THAN HE DID MY LADY YET SHE IS DEAD AND HE LIVES AND PERHAPS MAY DO TO LOVE AGAIN
HE WAS THE FIRST EARL OF SUNDERLAND AND MARRIED ELIZABETH DAUGHTER OF LORD GERARD
AND HIS LADY WAS CARRIED IN A LITTER
I CAN NEVER BELIEVE HER BEAUTY ABLE TO SMITE ANYBODY
THEY HAVE A BROTHER THAT IS NOT LIKE THEM AND IS A BARONET BESIDES
I FIND MYSELF FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO CONVERSE WITH A LADY BELOW THAT IS FALLEN OUT WITH ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE HER HUSBAND AND SHE CANNOT AGREE
SURE BY THE NEXT I SHALL WRITE SOME LEARNED EPISTLE TO HER I HAVE BEEN SO LONG ABOUT IT
AND WHEN HE RETIRED IN LATER YEARS TO AN ESTATE NEAR FARNHAM IN SURREY HE GAVE TO IT THE NAME OF MOOR PARK
LET US BOTH HAVE PATIENCE TO WAIT WHAT TIME AND FORTUNE WILL DO FOR US
MELANCHOLY MUST NEEDS DO YOU MORE HURT THAN TO ANOTHER TO WHOM IT MAY BE NATURAL AS I THINK IT IS TO ME
AND WHEN THE READER SHALL CLOSE THIS VOLUME LET IT NOT BE WITHOUT A FEELING OF GRATITUDE TO THE UNKNOWN WHOSE MODESTY ALONE PREVENTS ME FROM CHANGING THE TITLE OF FELLOW-SERVANT TO THAT OF FELLOW-EDITOR
HENRY CROMWELL WAS OLIVER CROMWELL'S SECOND SON
I KEPT ONE OF THE LITTLE GLASSES MYSELF
HIS OPINIONS ON RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SUCH AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG MAN OF QUICK PARTS WHO HAD RECEIVED A RAMBLING EDUCATION WHO HAD NOT THOUGHT DEEPLY WHO HAD BEEN DISGUSTED BY THE MOROSE AUSTERITY OF THE PURITANS AND WHO SURROUNDED FROM CHILDHOOD BY THE HUBBUB OF CONFLICTING SECTS MIGHT EASILY LEARN TO FEEL AN IMPARTIAL CONTEMPT FOR THEM ALL
WHAT IS CONTENTMENT MUST BE LEFT TO EVERY PARTICULAR PERSON TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES SINCE THEY ONLY KNOW WHAT IS SO TO THEM WHICH DIFFERS IN ALL ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL HUMOURS
THE EPISODE CONCERNING MISTRESS HARRISON AND THE QUEEN IS EXPLAINED BY THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTESS OF WARWICK
I ONLY BEG THAT WHATSOEVER HE DOES IN THAT KIND MAY BE EXCUSED BY HIS RELATION TO ME AND THAT WHENEVER YOU ARE MOVED TO THINK HE DOES YOU WRONG YOU WILL AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER THAT HIS SISTER LOVES YOU PASSIONATELY AND NOBLY
AND UPON THESE TERMS WE ARE FRIENDS AGAIN ARE WE NOT
THERE BEING NO BISHOP'S COURT AT THIS TIME THERE ARE LEGAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY AND WE NEVER HEAR THE RESULT OF THE PETITION
HOW OFTEN DO I SIT IN COMPANY A WHOLE DAY AND WHEN THEY ARE GONE AM NOT ABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF SIX WORDS THAT WAS SAID AND MANY TIMES COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER PLEASED WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT MY OWN THOUGHTS GIVE ME THAT TIS ALL I CAN DO TO BE SO CIVIL AS NOT TO LET THEM SEE THEY TROUBLE ME
AND SUCH A WIFE MAY BE SAID TO DO AS A KINSWOMAN OF OURS THAT HAD A HUSBAND WHO WAS NOT ALWAYS HIMSELF
THE WEALTH OF THE WHOLE WORLD BY THE GRACE OF GOD SHALL NOT TEMPT ME TO BREAK MY WORD WITH YOU NOR THE IMPORTUNITY OF ALL MY FRIENDS I HAVE
TEMPLE JOINS HIS FATHER SOON AFTER THIS AND STAYS IN IRELAND A FEW MONTHS
HOW DO YOU KNOW I TOOK CARE YOUR HAIR SHOULD NOT BE SPOILED
THE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN IN THE YEARS 1653 AND 1654 AND FORM A CLEAR AND CONNECTED STORY OF THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF THE YOUNG COUPLE DURING THAT TIME
I NEVER UNDERSTAND ANYBODY THAT DOES NOT SPEAK PLAIN ENGLISH AND HE NEVER USES THAT TO ME OF LATE BUT TELLS ME THE FINEST STORIES I MAY APPLY THEM HOW I PLEASE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE MARRIED WHEN THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS GREAT KINDNESS AND HOW MISERABLY THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES DECEIVED
BUT IF AS YOU CONFESS TIS THAT WHICH HARDLY HAPPENS ONCE IN TWO AGES WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THE WORLD SHOULD DISCERN WE WERE NOT LIKE THE REST
PRAY PUT HIM IN MIND OF IT AND LET HIM SHOW IT YOU BEFORE HE SENDS IT ME FOR I WILL NOT ALTOGETHER TRUST TO HIS HONESTY
VOWEL THE OTHER PLOTTER IS ALSO EXECUTED BUT THE THIRD SAVES HIMSELF AS WE KNOW BY CONFESSION
AND TO DO THAT I MUST IF YOU SEE ME THUS MAKE IT THE LAST OF OUR INTERVIEWS
HE WAS SO PASSIONATE FOR HER BEFORE HE HAD HER AND SO PLEASED WITH HER SINCE THAT IN EARNEST I DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE SHE COULD HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO WISH FOR THAT SHE HAD NOT ALREADY IN SUCH A HUSBAND WITH SUCH A FORTUNE
THERE WERE OSBORNES--BEFORE THERE WERE OSBORNES OF CHICKSANDS--WHO COMING OUT OF THE NORTH SETTLED AT PURLEIGH IN ESSEX WHERE WE FIND THEM IN THE YEAR 1442
IF I COULD DO SO TOO THERE WERE NO DISPUTE IN'T
I TOLD JANE THAT YOU LIKED HER PRESENT AND SHE I FIND IS RESOLVED TO SPOIL YOUR COMPLIMENT AND MAKE YOU CONFESS AT LAST THAT THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE EATING
AND CERTAINLY IF IT DID SO ILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE AS IT DOES WITH ME IT WOULD NEVER BE WORN
CYRUS IN ONE MYSTERIOUS F.G
A SADNESS THAT HE DISCOVERED AT YOUR GOING AWAY INCLINED HIM TO BELIEVE YOU WERE ILL SATISFIED AND MADE HIM CREDIT WHAT I SAID
WELL MAY LORD KEBLE SORE LAMENT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD REJOICE AT SUCH NEWS
DOROTHY LEFT A SON THE REV
EARLY IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES I
WHEN THE ADMIRAL RETURNED TO HIS SHIP THE CAPTAIN ALSO PERPLEXED ENOUGH APPLIED TO LADY TEMPLE WHO SOON SAW THAT HE DESIRED TO GET OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTY BY HER HELP
HE WAS SO WEARY OF HIS THAT HE WOULD PART WITH IT UPON ANY TERMS
FIVE BUTTRESSES FLANK THE SIDE WALL BUILT SO THAT THEY SHADE THE LOWER WINDOWS FROM THE MORNING SUN,--IN ONE PLACE REACHING TO THE SILL OF AN UPPER WINDOW
I WONDER YOU DID NOT COME BEFORE YOUR LAST LETTER
WE ALL LIGHTED AND MET AND I FOUND MORE THAN I LOOKED FOR BY TWO DAMSELS AND THEIR SQUIRES
THE SOONER YOU DESPATCH AWAY WILL BE THE BETTER I THINK SINCE I HAVE NO HOPES OF SEEING YOU BEFORE YOU GO
BUT HER FAVOURITE BOOKS WERE THOSE PONDEROUS FRENCH ROMANCES WHICH MODERN READERS KNOW CHIEFLY FROM THE PLEASANT SATIRE OF CHARLOTTE LENNOX
BUT DO ME THE RIGHT AS TO LET HIM KNOW I AM NOT SO POSSESSED WITH IT AS TO CONSENT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN SUCH A COMMISSION
TIS WORK FOR AN AGE AND TIS TO BE FEARED I SHALL BE SO OLD BEFORE I AM GOOD THAT TWILL NOT BE CONSIDERABLE TO ANYBODY BUT MYSELF WHETHER I AM SO OR NOT
DOROTHY OSBORNE WAS IN THE MEANTIME BESIEGED BY AS MANY SUITORS AS WERE DRAWN TO BELMONT BY THE FAME OF PORTIA
METHINKS THE HAND AND THE STYLE BOTH SHOW HER A GREAT PERSON AND TIS WRIT IN THE WAY THAT'S NOW AFFECTED BY ALL THAT PRETEND TO WIT AND GOOD BREEDING
THESE ARE TRUTHS THAT MIGHT BECOME A PULPIT BETTER THAN MR ARBRY'S PREDICTIONS
AT LAST IN A PITIFUL TONE SISTER SAYS HE I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT WHEN ANYTHING TROUBLES YOU OF ALL THINGS YOU APPREHEND GOING TO BED BECAUSE THERE IT INCREASES UPON YOU AND YOU LIE AT THE MERCY OF ALL YOUR SAD THOUGHT WHICH THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT ADDS A HORROR TO
YET IN SPITE OF PATIENCE TOIL AND THE KINDNESS OF LEARNED FRIENDS THE EDITOR IS BOUND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME NAMES REMAIN MERE WORDS TO HIM AND BUT TOO MANY ALLUSIONS ARE MYSTERIOUSLY DIM
YET I'LL SAY THAT FOR HIM HE STOOD STOUTLY FOR TITHES THOUGH IN MY OPINION FEW DESERVE THEM LESS THAN HE
I WAS SO ALTERED FROM A CHEERFUL HUMOUR THAT WAS ALWAYS ALIKE NEVER OVER MERRY BUT ALWAYS PLEASED I WAS GROWN HEAVY AND SULLEN FROWARD AND DISCOMPOSED
THE FACT THAT NEW YEAR'S DAY WAS AT THIS PERIOD MARCH 25--A FACT SOMETIMES IGNORED BY ANTIQUARIANS OF HIGH REPUTE--ADDS GREATLY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF ASCERTAINING EXACT DATES AND AS AN INSTANCE OF THIS WE FIND IN DIFFERENT CHRONICLES OF AUTHORITY SIR PETER OSBORNE'S DEATH CORRECTLY YET DIFFERENTLY GIVEN AS HAPPENING IN MARCH 1653 AND MARCH 1654
LETTER 29 SIR,--I CAN GIVE YOU LEAVE TO DOUBT ANYTHING BUT MY KINDNESS THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU I SPAKE AS I MEANT WHEN I SAID I HAD NOT THE VANITY TO BELIEVE I DESERV'D YOURS FOR I AM NOT CERTAIN WHETHER TIS POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY TO DESERVE THAT ANOTHER SHOULD LOVE THEM ABOVE THEMSELVES THOUGH I AM CERTAIN MANY MAY DESERVE IT MORE THAN ME
NO SURE I MAY BE JUST TO YOU AND HIM BOTH AND TO BE A KIND SISTER WILL TAKE NOTHING FROM MY BEING A PERFECT FRIEND
OTHER FRIENDS WE HAVE THEN LIVING BUT NONE SO INTIMATE OR WELL BELOVED
HIS FATHER DIED JULY 12 1652
I TAKE IT KINDLY THAT YOU USED ART TO CONCEAL OUR STORY AND SATISFY MY NICE APPREHENSIONS BUT I'LL NOT IMPOSE THAT CONSTRAINT UPON YOU ANY LONGER FOR I FIND MY KIND BROTHER PUBLISHES IT WITH MORE EARNESTNESS THAN EVER I STROVE TO CONCEAL IT
SHE DIED--PROBABLY IN CHILDBED--IN NOVEMBER OF NEXT YEAR 1654 AND WAS BURIED AT PETWORTH WITH HER INFANT SON
BUT LET ME BEG THEN THAT YOU WILL LEAVE OFF THOSE DISMAL THOUGHTS
NAY MORE WHEN THEY HAVE PULLED UP THEIR FLOORS FOR FIREWOOD AND ARE DYING OF HUNGER AND WANT IN THE STONE SHELL OF CASTLE CORNET FOR THE LOVE OF THEIR KING
IF THIS BE A FAULT IN ME TIS AT LEAST A WELL-NATURED ONE
I GIVE YOU NOTICE ON'T THAT YOU MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING IT SOMETIMES WHILST TIS THERE
LETTER 19._--LADY RUTHIN IS SUSAN DAUGHTER AND HEIRESS OF CHARLES LONGUEVILLE LORD GREY DE RUTHIN
SO I WITH A GREAT DEAL MORE REASON DO DECLARE THAT I WILL NO LONGER BE A FRIEND TO ONE THAT'S NONE TO HIMSELF NOR APPREHEND THE LOSS OF WHAT YOU HAZARD EVERY DAY AT TENNIS
IN EARNEST I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY BUT IF YOUR FATHER DOES NOT USE ALL HIS KINDNESS AND ALL HIS POWER TO MAKE YOU CONSIDER YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE HE IS NOT LIKE OTHER FATHERS
I'LL SWEAR I CRIED FOR HER WHEN I READ IT FIRST THOUGH SHE WERE BUT AN IMAGINARY PERSON
AND IF IT WERE AS CERTAIN THAT THE SAME THING WOULD DO US GOOD AS TIS THAT THE SAME THING WOULD PLEASE US I SHOULD NOT NEED TO DOUBT IT
TIS ENOUGH TO TELL YOU I AM EVER YOURS
I WONDER WITH WHAT CONFIDENCE YOU CAN COMPLAIN OF MY SHORT LETTERS THAT ARE SO GUILTY YOURSELF IN THE SAME KIND
SHE WAS VERY HANDSOME AND IS VERY GOOD ONE MAY READ IT IN HER FACE AT FIRST SIGHT A WOMAN THAT IS HUGELY CIVIL TO ALL PEOPLE AND TAKES AS GENERALLY AS ANYBODY THAT I KNOW BUT NOT MORE THAN MY COUSIN MOLLE'S LETTERS DO BUT WHICH YET YOU DO NOT LIKE YOU SAY NOR I NEITHER I'LL SWEAR
SHE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN GIFTED IN A SUPERLATIVE DEGREE WITH ALL THAT IS CONSIDERED MOST LOVELY IN A WOMAN'S CHARACTER
TIS THE GREATEST CURSE I CAN INVENT
AND TO SPEAK TRUTH COLLINS DID NOT BRING ME THAT LETTER
SHE MARRIED SIR JAMES THYNNE
BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WARS FROM MR WALLER'S PEN AND CANNOT FIND THAT HE EVER PUBLISHED ONE
HER FATHER GROWING DAILY WEAKER AND WEAKER WAS SINKING INTO HIS GRAVE BEFORE HER EYES
TIS HE THAT HAS MARRIED MRS GERHERD AND I ADMIRE THEIR COURAGE
HIS REFERENCE TO THE UNHAPPY DIFFERENCES STRENGTHENS MY VIEW THAT THE LETTERS OF THE FORMER CHAPTER BELONG ALL TO ONE DATE
THE LIFE OF LADY PEMBROKE WAS EMBITTERED BY THIS MAN FOR NEAR TWENTY YEARS AND SHE WAS AT LENGTH COMPELLED TO SEPARATE FROM HIM
LEST YOU SHOULD BE OF THE SAME HUMOUR I WILL NOT PITY YOU LAME AS YOU ARE
YOU NEED NOT MAKE EXCUSES NEITHER FOR YOURS
AFTER THAT I EXPECT NO MORE UNLESS YOU STAY FOR A WIND TILL YOU ARRIVE AT DUBLIN
TIS WELL YOU ARE GONE PAST MY RECOVERY
BUT THAT WHICH I WOULD SAY IS IN SHORT THIS
I THINK I CANNOT LEAVE YOU BETTER THAN WITH THIS ASSURANCE
YOU MUST USE TO WRITE BEFORE HE COMES I THINK THAT IT MAY BE SURE TO BE READY AGAINST HE GOES
NOW I TALK OF LAUGHING IT MAKES ME THINK OF POOR JANE
TEMPLE'S MOTHER WAS A SISTER OF DR HAMMOND TO WHOM ONE DR JOHN COLLOP A POETASTER UNKNOWN IN THESE DAYS EVEN BY NAME BEGINS AN ODE SERAPHIC DOCTOR BRIGHT EVANGELIST THE SERAPHIC DOCTOR WAS RECTOR OF PENSHURST NEAR TUNBRIDGE WELLS THE SEAT OF THE SYDNEYS
PASSING OVER THE MEASLES OF HIS INFANCY AND OTHER TRIVIAL DETAILS OF CHILDHOOD WHICH HE DESCRIBES MINUTELY WE FIND HIM AS A BOY AT ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCHE WHERE HE IS THE PUPIL OF ONE MR JOHN BRINSLEY
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO FIND YOU HERE THEN
WHEN I SHALL DO IT AGAIN GOD ONLY KNOWS
BUT I HAD FORBID IT THEM SO STRICTLY BEFORE THAT THEY OFFERED NOT TO STIR FARTHER THAN TO LOOK OUT OF WINDOW AS NOT THINKING THERE WAS ANY NECESSITY OF GIVING US THEIR EYES AS WELL AS THEIR EARS
HE WAS WEARY AND HEAVY LADEN WITH UNJUST BURDENS HEAPED ON HIM BY THOSE FOR WHOM AND WITH WHOM HE WAS FIGHTING
I WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD HER EXCEPTED SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN BEAUTIES FOR MY COMFORT BUT SHE WOULD NOT
AND I AM SO TIRED WITH MAKING OF SIGNS AND TOKENS FOR EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY
MY LORD OF HOLLAND'S DAUGHTER LADY DIANA RICH WAS ONE OF DOROTHY'S DEAREST AND MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS
HOW WILLINGLY WOULD I TELL YOU ANYTHING THAT I THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE YOU
VERY LITTLE INDEED OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE OF THAT GENERATION IS SO WELL WORTH READING HERE MACAULAY INDULGES IN AN ELOQUENT BUT LENGTHY PHILIPPIC AGAINST THAT VILE PHRASE THE DIGNITY OF HISTORY WHICH WE MAY OMIT,--TAKING UP THE THREAD OF HIS DISCOURSE WHERE HE RECURS TO THE AFFAIRS OF OUR TWO LOVERS
EITHER HE HAS A GREAT POWER OVER HIMSELF OR YOU HAVE A GREAT INTEREST IN HIM OR BOTH
THEY ARE MENTIONED AS OF EUROPEAN CELEBRITY
JE VOUS SOUHAIT TOUT CE QUE VOUS DESIRE LETTER 63 JULY THE 4TH 1654 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD STRENGTHENING TO MY PARTY AS YOU SAY
FOR MY LIFE I COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW I HAD LOST YOU OR WHY YOU SHOULD CALL THAT A SILENCE OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS WHICH YOU INTENDED SO MUCH LONGER
I LOOK UPON'T AS ONE OF MY GREAT MISFORTUNES AND I MUST BEAR IT AS THAT WHICH IS NOT MY FIRST NOR LIKELY TO BE MY LAST
YET HE PITIES ME TOO AND SWEARS I AM CONDEMNED TO BE THE MISERABLEST PERSON UPON EARTH
NOR ARE WE SORRY THAT HE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN GRACE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH HIS PRESENCE AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS FOR LOYAL KENT IN THE GOOD DAYS WHEN THE KING ENJOYED HIS OWN AGAIN
COURTENAY THINKS SHE MAY BE ONE MISTRESS CHAMBERS AN HEIRESS WHO ULTIMATELY MARRIED TEMPLE'S BROTHER JOHN AND THIS CONJECTURE IS HERE FOLLOWED
WHAT NICE MISTAKEN POINTS OF HONOUR I PRETENDED TO AND YET COULD ALLOW HIM ROOM IN THE SAME BED WITH ME
BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE AN HUMOUR WILL NOT SUFFER ME TO EXPOSE MYSELF TO PEOPLE'S SCORN
YOUR LETTER 13._--THERE IS SOME ALLUSION HERE TO AN INCONSTANT LOVER OF MY LADY DIANA RICH WHO SEEMS TO HAVE DESERTED HIS MISTRESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SORE EYES WITH WHICH DOROTHY TOLD US IN A FORMER LETTER HER FRIEND WAS AFFLICTED
MEANWHILE THE LETTERS DO NOT GROW LESS KIND
ON THE CONTRARY BECAUSE I SEE TIS IN VAIN TO THINK OF CURING YOU I'LL STUDY ONLY TO GIVE YOU WHAT EASE I CAN AND LEAVE THE REST TO BETTER PHYSICIANS,--TO TIME AND FORTUNE
YOUR SERVANT KISSES YOUR HANDS AND I AM YOUR FAITHFUL
HE WAS WORN OUT BY THE SIEGE
TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY A PERSON OF QUALITY LONDON
YOU MUST E'EN BE CONTENT TO STAY AT HOME I THINK AND SEE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US THOUGH I EXPECT NOTHING OF GOOD
I AM COMBING AND CURLING AND KISSING THIS LOCK ALL DAY AND DREAMING ON'T ALL NIGHT
BUT IF YOU WERE AN EMPEROR I SHOULD NOT BE SO BOLD WITH YOU AS TO CLAIM YOUR PROMISE
HOWEVER I CANNOT BUT WISH YOU HAD STAYED LONGER AT EPSOM AND DRUNK THE WATERS WITH MORE ORDER THOUGH IN A LESS PROPORTION
IN 1665 TEMPLE WAS SENT TO BRUSSELS AS ENGLISH REPRESENTATIVE AND HIS FAMILY JOINED HIM IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
FIRST AS MY COUSIN FRANKLIN SAYS OUR HUMOURS MUST AGREE
TEMPLE TOO CLAIMS THE CONSIDERATION AT OUR HANDS OF A FEW WORDS CONCERNING HIS NEAR RELATIVES AND THEIR POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
AND MR D
PRAY WHEN IT MAY BE NO TROUBLE TO HER TELL HER HOW MUCH I AM HER SERVANT
HE PRETENDED TO BE A MAN OF SCIENCE NOT A MAN GIFTED WITH SUPERNATURAL POWERS
I CANNOT FORBEAR TELLING YOU THE OTHER DAY HE MADE ME A VISIT AND I TO PREVENT HIS MAKING DISCOURSE TO ME MADE MRS GOLDSMITH AND JANE SIT BY ALL THE WHILE
BUT IF IN SPITE OF ALL OUR CAUTION IT BE DISCOVERED TIS NO TREASON NOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S ILL
AND IF THE ASTUTE READER SHALL THINK FIT TO AGREE WITH ME IN BELIEVING TEMPLE'S FELLOW-SERVANT TO BE THIS JANE WRIGHT ON SUCH SLENDER EVIDENCE AND SLIGHT THREAD OF ARGUMENT HE MAY WELL DO SO
ONE IS MY ELDEST NIECE WHO SURE WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD TO SHOW TIS POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN TO BE SILENT
THE DESPAIR I WAS IN AT NOT HEARING FROM YOU LAST WEEK AND THE BELIEF THAT ALL MY LETTERS HAD MISCARRIED BY SOME TREACHERY AMONG MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO I AM SORRY HAVE THE NAME OF YOURS MADE ME PRESS MY FATHER BY ALL MEANS IMAGINABLE TO GIVE ME LEAVE TO GO PRESENTLY IF I HEARD NOT FROM YOU THIS POST
IF I WERE YOUR ENEMY I COULD NOT USE YOU ILL WHEN I SAW FORTUNE DO IT TOO AND IN GALLANTRY AND GOOD NATURE BOTH I SHOULD THINK MYSELF RATHER OBLIGED TO PROTECT YOU FROM HER INJURY IF IT LAY IN MY POWER THAN DOUBLE THEM UPON YOU
BUT I HAVE NOT SKILL IT SEEMS FOR I LIKE YOURS TOO
I SHALL BE EVEN WITH YOU FOR YOUR SHORT LETTER
BUT UNLESS YOU SAY SO TOO I DO NOT THINK I SHALL
WITHOUT HIS PRECEPTS MY OWN JUDGMENT WOULD PRESERVE ME FROM DOING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE PREJUDICIAL TO YOU OR UNJUSTIFIABLE TO THE WORLD
OH BUT YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE POOR MR HENINGHAM HAS NO LUCK
AND HE MAKES A REMARK UPON'T THAT I CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH WHEN I PLEASE AND WISHES I WOULD PRACTISE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AS WELL AS THERE
NO BRIGHT CHANCE SEEMED TO OPEN BEFORE HER AND THEIR MARRIAGE SEEMED AN IMPOSSIBILITY
TO FIND THAT YOU HAVE OVERCOME YOUR LONG JOURNEY AND THAT YOU ARE WELL AND IN A PLACE WHERE TIS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE YOU IS SUCH A SATISFACTION AS I WHO HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO MANY MAY BE ALLOWED TO DOUBT OF
BESIDES THAT IF I HAD MY PEN IS SO VERY GOOD THAT IT WRITES AN INVISIBLE HAND I THINK
THERE IS ONE IN DUBLIN NOW THAT NE'ER SAW MUCH FARTHER HAS TOLD ME TWICE AS MANY I DARE SWEAR OF IRELAND
NOT STUDIED AS AN ORATION NOR MADE UP OF HARD WORDS LIKE A CHARM
TIS ONLY A PIECE TAKEN OUT OF A NEW THING OF HIS
AND THE EARL OF WARWICK PROMPTED WE SHOULD SUPPOSE BY SIR JOHN DANVERS OFFERING TERMS TO SIR PETER WHICH HE INDIGNANTLY REJECTED
BUT YOU DO NOT TELL ME YET HOW YOU FOUND HIM OUT
I TELL HIM I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT
I AM SORRY FOR POOR WALKER BUT YOU NEED NOT DOUBT OF WHAT HE HAS OF YOURS IN HIS HANDS FOR IT SEEMS HE DOES NOT USE TO DO HIS WORK HIMSELF
YOUNG SIR HARRY YELVERTON LADY RUTHIN'S HUSBAND BROKE A THEOLOGICAL LANCE WITH HIS SON THE YOUNGER EDWARD BAGSHAWE TO VINDICATE THE CAUSE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
BESIDE THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR IT DOES NOT SOUND HANDSOMELY
DO YOU NOT REPENT THAT YOU TOOK IT TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE
HE ASKED US MORE QUESTIONS THAN WE DID HIM AND CAUGHT AT EVERYTHING WE SAID WITHOUT DISCERNING THAT WE ABUSED HIM AND SAID THINGS PURPOSELY TO CONFOUND HIM
AND SO FAR IT'S WELL ENOUGH
HE SAT IN THE LONG PARLIAMENT FOR YARMOUTH IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND AFTERWARDS BECAME A MEMBER OF THE UPPER HOUSE
FOR THOUGH MY KINDNESS WILL NOT LET ME LOOK SO UPON YOU YOU CAN SEE WHAT I DO TO OTHER PEOPLE
BUT TRUST ME I THINK THESE ARE AS INNOCENT AS THOSE COULD BE
THEREFORE WHEN I CHIDE UNLESS IT BE THAT YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL ENOUGH OF YOURSELF AND HAZARD TOO MUCH A HEALTH THAT I AM MORE CONCERNED IN THAN MY OWN YOU NEED NOT STUDY MUCH FOR EXCUSES I CAN EASILY FORGIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT WANT OF KINDNESS
IN THE NEWS-BOOKS AND TRACTS OF THE DAY WE FIND REFERENCES TO SERMONS PREACHED BY HIM BY COMMAND BEFORE THE ARMY OF THE PARLIAMENT AND WE HAVE REPRINTS OF SOME OF THESE
I HAVE LIVED UPON THEM EVER SINCE I CAME BUT HAD THRIVED MUCH BETTER HAD THEY BEEN LONGER
I SWEAR MY EYES ARE SO HEAVY THAT I HARDLY SEE WHAT I WRITE NOR DO I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO READ IT WHEN I HAVE DONE
IT WAS THE ONLY SON OF LADY RICH WHO MARRIED FRANCES CROMWELL
SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF SIR CHARLES LUCAS AND WAS BORN AT COLCHESTER TOWARDS THE END OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I
YOU ARE STILL RESOLVED TO FOLLOW YOUR BLIND GUIDE AND I TO PITY WHERE I CANNOT HELP
I HAVE BUT ONE THAT'S ANYTHING LIKE AND THAT'S A GREAT ONE BUT I WILL SEND IT SOME TIME OR OTHER TO COOPER OR HOSKINS AND HAVE A LITTLE ONE DRAWN BY IT IF I CANNOT BE IN TOWN TO SIT MYSELF
AFTER THIS SHE ABANDONED HER DESIGN OF PASSING FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY DISAFFECTING THE PEOPLE WITH HER PROPHECIES AND WE HEAR NO MORE OF HER
OSBORNE
OSBORNE
OSBORNE
OSBORNE
OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM IS SET DOWN HEREAFTER
I HAVE NO COMPANY NOW BUT MY NIECE PEYTON AND MY BROTHER WILL BE SHORTLY FOR THE TERM BUT WILL MAKE NO LONG STAY IN TOWN
THAT I HOPE MERELY BECAUSE YOU BID ME AND LOSE THAT HOPE AS OFTEN AS I CONSIDER ANYTHING BUT YOURS
JOHN LONGE WHO HAD MARRIED HIS WIFE'S SISTER
HE WAS BORN IN 1622 AND WAS THE SECOND SON OF ROBERT EARL OF LEICESTER
ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE ENTIRELY UNSUITED TO EACH OTHER WHEN LADY PEMBROKE IN HER MEMORIALS IS FOUND TO WRITE THUS OF HER HUSBAND
OF ALL THINGS I ADMIRE MY COUSIN MOLLE HAS NOT GOT IT BY THE END HE THAT FREQUENTS THAT FAMILY SO MUCH AND IS AT THIS INSTANT AT KIMBOLTON
SIR THOMAS'S HOUSE IS RANSACKED HE HIMSELF IS TAKEN PRISONER NEAR BURY ST EDMUNDS BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND COMMITTED TO THE TOWER
BUT I SHALL TAKE IT ILL IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THE SAME FREEDOM WITH ME WHENSOEVER I AM CAPABLE OF SERVING YOU
OH MY HEART
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE EXCHANGE PRAY CALL AT THE GREAT SHOP ABOVE THE FLOWER POTT I SPOKE TO HEAMS THE MAN OF THE SHOP WHEN I WAS IN TOWN FOR A QUART OF ORANGE-FLOWER WATER
I HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE AND AM SO LITTLE TAKEN WITH THE PLACE THAT I COULD SIT HERE SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT SO MUCH AS THINKING ONCE OF GOING TO IT
CLEOPATRE IN RICHARD LOVEDAY AN ELEGANT LETTER-WRITER OF THIS TIME
OR SAY SHE HAS NOT QUITE SO MUCH MAY NOT HER FORTUNE MAKE IT UP
GOSSIPING BISHOP BURNET IN ONE OF HIS MORE ILL-NATURED PASSAGES TELLS US THAT TEMPLE WAS AN EPICUREAN THINKING RELIGION TO BE FIT ONLY FOR THE MOB AND A CORRUPTER OF ALL THAT CAME NEAR HIM
AND FOR MY PART AT THIS PRESENT I VERILY BELIEVE I COULD FIND IT IN THE LONG WALK AT DUBLIN
FOR THOUGH THE POOR FELLOW MADE WHAT HASTE HE COULD TO UNTIE HIS BAG I DID NOTHING BUT CHIDE HIM FOR BEING SO SLOW
BOTH MADE ME GLAD I HAD SCAPED HIM AND SORRY FOR HIS MISFORTUNE WHICH IN EARNEST WAS THE LEAST RETURN HIS MANY CIVILITIES TO ME COULD DESERVE
BUT I AM NOT A LITTLE ANNOYED TO FIND YOU HAD IT NOT
BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE LED A RAMBLING LIFE SOMETIMES ON THE CONTINENT SOMETIMES IN IRELAND SOMETIMES IN LONDON
IT DID NOT CARRY HIM INTO THE KING'S BENCH COURT LIKE LORD CHANDOS DUEL SO HISTORY IS SILENT ABOUT IT
HE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A HOLY HARMLESS MAN BUT INCURRED BOTH THE HATE AND RIDICULE OF HIS OPPONENTS
WOULD TO GOD I HAD ALL THAT GOOD-NATURE YOU COMPLAIN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF I COULD FIND WAYS ENOUGH TO DISPOSE ON'T AMONGST MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS
THE RING TOO IS VERY WELL ONLY A LITTLE OF THE BIGGEST
I AM NOT ALWAYS IN THE HUMOUR TO WRANGLE AND DISPUTE
THEY SAY HE HAS TURNED AWAY ALMOST EVERY SERVANT IN THE HOUSE AND LEFT HER AT PENSHURST TO DIGEST IT AS SHE CAN
SIR,--IT WAS SURE A LESS FAULT IN ME TO MAKE A SCRUPLE OF READING YOUR LETTER TO YOUR BROTHER WHICH IN ALL LIKELIHOOD I COULD NOT BE CONCERNED IN THAN FOR YOU TO CONDEMN THE FREEDOM YOU TAKE OF GIVING ME DIRECTIONS IN A THING WHERE WE ARE EQUALLY CONCERNED
HIS ANGER ALONE WHEN IT MEETS WITH NOTHING THAT RESISTS IT CANNOT BE LOUD ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE NEIGHBOURS
IT OPENS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN DAVID AND JONATHAN AND UPON THAT OCCASION A DIGRESSION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF LOVE
NO IN EARNEST NOR I COULD NOT LOVE ANY PERSON THAT I THOUGHT HAD IT NOT TO A GOOD DEGREE
THERE IS ONE OF THE SAME NAME WHO IN 1688 DECLARES HIMSELF OPENLY TO BE A PAPIST AND IS TRIED UNDER THE TEST ACT
THE GREAT ROUTE THROUGH WALES TO HOLYHEAD WAS IN SUCH A STATE THAT IN 1685 THE VICEROY GOING TO IRELAND WAS FIVE HOURS IN TRAVELLING THE FOURTEEN MILES FROM ST ASAPH TO CONWAY
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAME SO NEAR ME AS BEDFORD AND WOULD NOT SEE ME
BUT TIS CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING MORE MISTAKEN THAN THE ROMAN COURAGE WHEN THEY KILLED THEMSELVES TO AVOID MISFORTUNES THAT WERE INFINITELY WORSE THAN DEATH
AND FURTHERMORE WAS ONE OF THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF THE GREAT SEAL FROM 1648-1654
AND IF IT BE IGNORANCE IN US BOTH WE'LL FORGIVE IT ONE ANOTHER
TWO OF THE FINEST YOUNG IRISH GREYHOUNDS THAT E'ER I SAW
WHAT A DEAL OF PAPER I HAVE SPENT UPON THIS IDLE FELLOW
AND WHEN HE CAN BRING ME A CERTIFICATE UNDER YOUR HAND THAT YOU THINK HIM A FIT HUSBAND FOR ME TIS VERY LIKELY I MAY HAVE HIM
TWILL NOT BE FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE THAT I SHOULD STAY HERE LONG
TIS THE DISCONTENT MY CROSSES IN THIS BUSINESS HAVE GIVEN ME MAKES ME THUS PEEVISH
NO I HAVE NO MORE TO DO IN'T BUT TO GROW EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE WEARY OF IT IF IT BE POSSIBLE THAT I HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF HATRED FOR IT
AFTER HER MARRIAGE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN LONDON JANUARY 31ST 1655 THEY LIVED FOR A YEAR AT THE HOME OF A FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY
BUT I NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY THAT EVER HAD IT MORE THAN IN FANCY SO THAT WILL NOT BE STRANGE IF YOU SHOULD MISS ON'T
I THAT AM NOT SO NIMBLE STAY BEHIND
YOUR UNHAPPY
THE VERY EXTERIOR OF IT IS CATHOLIC UNPURITANICAL
THIS ACTION MADE MR RICH JUDGE IT NOT CIVIL TO COME TO OUR HOUSE AND SO FOR SOME TIME FORBORE DOING IT
THE TITLE-PAGE OF PRAZIMENE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF ITS KIND RUNS AS FOLLOWS:--"TWO DELIGHTFUL NOVELS OR THE UNLUCKY FAIR ONE
IF YOU THINK TO SCAPE WITH SENDING ME SUCH BITS OF LETTERS YOU ARE MISTAKEN
ALL THAT I CAN SAY THEN IS THAT I RESOLVE ON NOTHING BUT TO ARM MYSELF WITH PATIENCE TO RESIST NOTHING THAT IS LAID UPON ME NOR STRUGGLE FOR WHAT I HAVE NO HOPE TO GET
I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS WEEK WHICH I WILL SEND YOU THAT YOU MAY SEE WHAT HOPES HE GIVES
WITH THE ROMANCE OF HER LIFE ALL PAST HISTORY AND FAST BECOMING AS MUCH A ROMANCE TO HERSELF AS IT SEEMS TO US LOOKING BACK AT IT AFTER MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES
BUT THEN YOU MUST RETURN MY KINDNESS WITH THE SAME CARE OF A LIFE THAT'S MUCH DEARER TO ME
AND NOT TO FLATTER OURSELVES OURS IS BUT A REFINED DEGREE OF MADNESS
HE IS OFTEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND ALWAYS DOES US THE FAVOUR TO SEND FOR HIS FRUIT HITHER
SHE IS OLD AND WAS NEVER HANDSOME AND YET IS COURTED A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN THE GREATEST BEAUTY IN THE WORLD WOULD BE THAT HAD NOT A FORTUNE
THEY KILL ME
LETTER 57._--LETTER OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE
YOUR FELLOW-SERVANT WHO IS AS OFTEN CALLED JANE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION OF DOROTHY IN A SOMEWHAT LOWER RANK OF LIFE
AND THOUGH I COULD THEN GIVE BUT LITTLE ACCOUNT OF YOU HE SMILED AS IF HE DID NOT ALTOGETHER BELIEVE ME AND AFTERWARDS MALICIOUSLY SAID HE WONDERED YOU DID NOT MARRY
AND J
SHE IS CALLED MY LADY AND HER NAME IS ALWAYS LINKED TO EXPRESSIONS OF TENDERNESS AND ESTEEM
HE WAS EDUCATED AT SIDNEY SUSSEX COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE AND SAT FOR HUNTINGDONSHIRE IN THE FIRST TWO PARLIAMENTS OF CHARLES I
AND FOR HIS PART HE WAS CONFIDENT THERE WAS NO SUCH CROSS AS A WIFE
MARCH THE 18TH 1654 HOW TRUE IT IS THAT A MISFORTUNE NEVER COMES SINGLE
IF YOU FIND ALL THIS TO BE SAD TRUTH HEREAFTER REMEMBER THAT I GAVE YOU FAIR WARNING
I SHALL BE BAITED MOST SWEETLY BUT SURE THEY WILL NOT EASILY MAKE ME CONSENT TO MAKE MY LIFE UNHAPPY TO SATISFY THEIR IMPORTUNITY
YOU SHOULD COME HITHER BUT THAT I EXPECT MY BROTHER EVERY DAY
COULD GEORGE ELIOT HERSELF HAVE DONE MORE FOR US IN LIKE SPACE
HE WAS MADE LORD-DEPUTY IN IRELAND IN 1657 BUT HE WEARIED OF THE WORK OF TRANSPLANTING THE IRISH AND PLANTING THE NEW SETTLERS WHICH HE WRITES ONLY BROUGHT HIM DISQUIET OF BODY AND MIND
FROM HENCE I MUST GO INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE TO MY LADY RUTHIN AND SO TO LONDON WHERE I SHALL FIND MY AUNT AND MY BROTHER PEYTON BETWIXT WHOM I THINK TO DIVIDE THIS SUMMER
IT IS THE LATEST THING IN LITERARY CIRCLES
I THREW IT INTO THE FIRE
BISHOP BURNET SAYS
JE N'AY GUERE PLUS DORMIE QUE VOUS ET MES SONGES N'ONT PAS ESTRES MOINS CONFUSE AU REST UNE BANDE DE VIOLONS QUE SONT VENU JOUER SOUS MA FENNESTRE M'OUT TOURMENTES DE TEL FACON QUE JE DOUBT FORT SI JE POURROIS JAMAIS LES SOUFFRIRE ENCORE JE NE SUIS POURTANT PAS EN FORT MAUVAISE HUMEUR ET JE M'EN-VOY AUSI TOST QUE JE SERAI HABILLEE VOIRE CE QU'IL EST POSIBLE DE FAIRE POUR VOSTRE SATTISFACTION APRES JE VIENDRE VOUS RENDRE CONTE DE NOS AFFAIRS ET QUOY QU'IL EN SERA VOUS NE SCAUROIS JAMAIS DOUBTE QUE JE NE VOUS AYME PLUS QUE TOUTES LES CHOSES DU MONDE
NO TO SPEAK INGENUOUSLY I THINK YOU GOT AN INTEREST THERE A GOOD WHILE BEFORE I THOUGHT YOU HAD ANY AND IT GREW SO INSENSIBLY AND YET SO FAST THAT ALL THE TRAVERSES IT HAS MET WITH SINCE HAS SERVED RATHER TO DISCOVER IT TO ME THAN AT ALL TO HINDER IT
FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THAT FORMERLY IN GREAT FAMILIES THE MEN SELDOM DISAGREE BUT THE WOMEN ARE ALWAYS SCOLDING
I MEANT THIS LETTER LONGER WHEN I BEGUN IT BUT AN EXTREME COLD THAT I HAVE TAKEN LIES SO IN MY HEAD AND MAKES IT ACHE SO VIOLENTLY THAT I HARDLY SEE WHAT I DO
SOMETHING IT IS BECOMING TO HER OVER WHICH SHE CAN MUSE AND DREAM AND WEAVE INTO TALES FOR THE CHILDREN WHO WILL GATHER ROUND HER
I FIND MY HEAD SO HEAVY
PERHAPS YOU MAY SEE HIM BUT I CANNOT DIRECT YOU WHERE TO FIND HIM FOR HE IS NOT YET RESOLVED HIMSELF WHERE TO LIE
MANY YEARS AGO SHE HAD AN INTRIGUE WITH THE DUKE OF ORMOND BY WHOM SHE HAD A SON BUT DOROTHY SPEAKS I THINK OF SOME LATER SCANDAL THAN THIS
AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
IF IT IS OLDER THAN THE BALLAD OF THE LORD OF LORNE IT MUST HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BEFORE HENRY VIII.'S REIGN
NO I LONG TO BE RID OF YOU AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT GO SOON ENOUGH
BESIDES THAT SHE NEEDS IT LESS NOW THAN EVER HER SON BEING AS I HEAR DEAD
AND TWOULD BE A PLEASING SURPRISE TO ME TO SEE YOU AMONGST MY SHEPHERDESSES
AND THERE IS JUSTICE IN'T
BUT THEY LITTLE KNEW OF WHAT USE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO ME
AND THROUGH THE BARONETAGES PEERAGES AND THE INVINCIBLE HEAPS OF GENEALOGICAL RECORDS WE HAVE GATHERED SOME FEW ACTUAL FACTS NECESSARY TO BE KNOWN OF DOROTHY'S RELATIONS HER HUMAN SURROUNDINGS THEIR LIVES AND ACTIONS
FOR EDWARD GUILPIN IN HIS SKIALETHIA 1598 SPEAKS OF TH OLDE BALLAD OF THE LORD OF LORNE WHOSE LAST LINE IN KING HARRIE'S DAY WAS BORNE
WE MAY REMEMBER TOO THAT DOROTHY'S YOUNGER BROTHER WAS ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH GENERAL MONK'S RELATIONS IN CORNWALL
SATURDAY I CONFESS WAS DEVOTED TO MY LADY
BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN INJURY TO YOU TO KEEP YOU IN EXPECTATION OF WHAT WAS NEVER LIKELY TO BE AS I APPREHENDED
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO TEMPT YOU TO STAY ONE MINUTE LONGER THAN YOUR FATHER AND YOUR BUSINESS OBLIGES YOU
IF IT DOES NOT I AM BUT WHERE I WAS
TELL ME AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH IS THAT I AM YOUR VALENTINE AND YOU ARE MINE
LILLY WAS NOW A MAN OF MEANS AND WAS ENABLED TO STUDY THAT SCIENCE WHICH HE AFTERWARDS PRACTISED WITH SO MUCH SUCCESS
I AM GLAD YOU ARE PLEASED WITH THAT DESCRIPTION I MADE YOU OF MY HUMOUR FOR THOUGH YOU HAD DISLIKED IT I AM AFRAID TIS PAST MY POWER TO HELP
YOU WILL NOT BE JEALOUS THOUGH I SAY I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
FROM WHICH WE NEED NOT DRAW ANY UNKINDER CONCLUSION THAN THAT HE WAS NO SOLEMN PURITANICAL SOLDIER BUT A MAN OF THE WORLD BRIGHTER AND MORE COURTEOUS THAN THE FREQUENTERS OF HIS FATHER'S COUNCIL AND THEREFORE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO DOROTHY
THIS NEXT WEEK BEING MICHAELMAS WEEK WE SHALL END ALL AND I BE AT LIBERTY I HOPE TO CONSIDER MY OWN CONTENTMENTS
LETTER 25._--DOROTHY'S DISSERTATIONS ON LOVE AND MARRIAGE ARE ALWAYS AMUSING IN THEIR DEMURENESS
BUT TAKES THIS TIME TO TORMENT ME WHICH APPEARS AT LEAST TO ME SO BARBAROUS A CRUELTY THAT THOUGH I THANK GOD I HAVE CHARITY ENOUGH PERFECTLY TO FORGIVE ALL THE INJURY HE CAN DO ME YET I AM AFRAID I SHALL NEVER LOOK UPON HIM AS A BROTHER MORE
IN EARNEST IT WOULD HAVE LAIN UPON MY CONSCIENCE IF I HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF MAKING YOUR POOR BOY LOSE A SERVICE THAT IF HE HAS THE WIT TO KNOW HOW TO VALUE IT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE FORGIVEN ME WHILE HE HAD LIVED
SURE TIS THE DEATH'S HEAD I SEE STAND BEFORE ME PUTS ME INTO THIS GRAVE DISCOURSE PRAY DO NOT THINK I MEANT THAT FOR A CONCEIT NEITHER
AND NOW THE ONLY HOME ON EARTH FOR DOROTHY LIES IN THE FUTURE
ONE WOULD THINK IT WERE I WHO HAD HEARD THE THREE SERMONS AND WERE TRYING TO MAKE A FOURTH
A ROYALIST AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM HER CONNECTIONS WITHOUT ANY OF THAT POLITICAL ASPERITY WHICH IS AS UNWOMANLY AS A LONG BEARD
I AM TO SPEND THIS NEXT WEEK IN TAKING LEAVE OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALL THE COMPANY IN'T PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE IT MORE
HE WROTE A DISCOURSE ON THE TRUTH AND REASONABLENESS OF THE RELIGION DELIVERED BY JESUS CHRIST A PREFACE TO DR MORTON'S WORK ON EPISCOPACY AND A VINDICATION OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF THE FAMOUS EDWARD BAGSHAWE
I COULD SAY A THOUSAND THINGS MORE TO THIS PURPOSE IF I WERE NOT IN HASTE TO SEND THIS AWAY,--THAT IT MAY COME TO YOU AT LEAST AS SOON AS THE OTHER
CHAPTER VII THE END OF THE THIRD VOLUME THIS SHORT SERIES OF NOTES WAS WRITTEN I THINK DURING A VISIT TO LONDON AFTER THE FORMAL BETROTHAL AND BEFORE THE MARRIAGE
HE WAS ROGER BOYLE AFTERWARDS EARL OF ORRERY THE FIFTH SON OF THE GREAT EARL OF CORK HE ACTED FOR THE PARLIAMENT AGAINST THE CATHOLICS IN IRELAND BUT WAS STILL THOUGHT TO RETAIN SOME PARTIALITY FOR THE KING'S PARTY
HE QUOTES IT AS THE ONLY LETTER WRITTEN AFTER LADY TEMPLE'S MARRIAGE WHICH HAS COME INTO HIS HANDS
IF I DID SAY ONCE THAT MY BROTHER SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN'T TWAS WHEN HIS CARRIAGE TOWARDS ME GAVE ME SUCH AN OCCASION AS COULD JUSTIFY THE KEEPING THAT DISTANCE WITH HIM
THE OTHER COUNTIES NOT JOINING IN AT THE RIGHT MOMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL PROCEDURE AT ROYALIST RISINGS IT IS DEFEATED BY FAIRFAX
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SADDER THAN YOU IF I HAD BEEN THEIR NEIGHBOUR TO HAVE SEEN THEM SO KIND
I BRED HER BETTER BUT YOU HAVE SPOILED HER
AN INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE OLD SIGN IS GIVEN IN A WORK ON LONDON TRADESMEN'S TOKENS IN WHICH IT IS SAID TO BE DERIVED FROM THE EARLIER REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SALUTATIONS OF THE ANGEL GABRIEL TO THE VIRGIN MARY IN WHICH EITHER LILIES WERE PLACED IN HIS HAND OR THEY WERE SET AS AN ACCESSORY IN A VASE
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FELT HIS ATTENTIONS AS VERY FLATTERING THOUGH HIS FATHER WAS THEN ONLY LORD GENERAL AND NOT YET PROTECTOR
I FOUND MYSELF SO INNOCENT THAT I NEVER BLUSHED WHEN THEY TOLD IT ME
HE BROUGHT A LETTER WITH HIM AND GAVE IT ME AS ONE HE HAD MET WITH DIRECTED TO ME HE THOUGHT IT CAME OUT OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
HIS HAIR WAS NOT POWDERED AND HIS CLOTHES WERE BUT ORDINARY
REMAIN MYSTERIOUS SYMBOLIC INITIALS OF GOSSIP AND SCANDALMONGERING
BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU DO THIS UPON THE JUSTEST GROUNDS AND SUCH AS MAY CONDUCE MOST TO YOUR QUIET AND FUTURE SATISFACTION
THAT VILE WENCH LETS YOU SEE ALL MY SCRIBBLES I BELIEVE
THE NEXT SHALL BE LONGER THOUGH I CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN I AM YOURS
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU SO KIND TO ME AS TO BE CRUEL TO YOURSELF IN WHOM I AM MORE CONCERNED
WHAT A SATISFACTION YOU HAD FOUND OUT TO MAKE ME FOR THE INJURIES YOU SAY YOU HAVE DONE ME
YOUR HEART NEVER TOLD IT YOU I DARE SWEAR
AND IT APPEARS THAT DOROTHY'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER MARRIED CATHERINE CHEEKE DAUGHTER OF THE THEN SIR THOMAS
IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST LETTER IN WHICH WE HAVE INTIMATION OF THE WORLD'S GOSSIP ABOUT DOROTHY'S LOVE AFFAIRS
HE RESISTED THE TRIAL OF THE KING AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH REFUSED TO SIT IN CROMWELL'S NEW HOUSE OF LORDS AND WAS AMONG THOSE PRESBYTERIANS WHO HELPED TO BRING ABOUT THE RESTORATION
ALL THE SERVANTS HAVE BEEN TO TAKE THEIR LEAVES ON ME AND SAY HOW SORRY THEY ARE TO HEAR I AM GOING OUT OF THE LAND
SIR,--I HAVE BEEN RECKONING UP HOW MANY FAULTS YOU LAY TO MY CHARGE IN YOUR LAST LETTER AND I FIND I AM SEVERE UNJUST UNMERCIFUL AND UNKIND
BECAUSE YOU MENTION MY LORD BROGHILL AND HIS WIT I HAVE SENT YOU SOME OF HIS VERSES
TIS ALL THE BEAUTY OF THOSE DOGS OR OF ANY KIND I THINK
I WAS NEVER BETTER PROVIDED IN MY LIFE FOR A GRAVE ADMONISHING DISCOURSE
JUST NOW I HAVE NEWS BROUGHT ME OF THE DEATH OF AN OLD RICH KNIGHT THAT HAS PROMISED ME THIS SEVEN YEARS TO MARRY ME WHENSOEVER HIS WIFE DIED AND NOW HE'S DEAD BEFORE HER AND HAS LEFT HER SUCH A WIDOW IT MAKES ME MAD TO THINK ON'T L1200 A YEAR JOINTURE AND L20,000 IN MONEY AND PERSONAL ESTATE AND ALL THIS I MIGHT HAVE HAD IF MR DEATH HAD BEEN PLEASED TO HAVE TAKEN HER INSTEAD OF HIM
FERNANDO MENDEZ PINTO DID I BELIEVE ACTUALLY VISIT CHINA AND IS SAID TO HAVE LANDED IN THE GULF OF PEKIN
TIS SUCH AN EASE AS YOU SAY NOT TO BE SOLICITOUS TO PLEASE OTHERS
BUT I SHALL ALWAYS HAVE A SENSE OF YOUR MISFORTUNES EQUAL IF NOT ABOVE MY OWN
THE LITERARY WORK OF LORD BROGHILL IS NOT UNKNOWN TO FAME AND MR WALLER'S VERSE IS STILL READ BY US
TIS THOU THAT MOV'ST THE WORLD THROUGH EV'RY PART AND HOLD'ST THE VAST FRAME CLOSE THAT NOTHING START FROM THE DUE PLACE AND OFFICE FIRST ORDAINED BY THEE WERE ALL THINGS MADE AND ARE SUSTAINED
BUT CUT NO MORE ON'T I WOULD NOT HAVE IT SPOILED FOR THE WORLD
A MAN INTENT TO FORCE FOR HIMSELF SOME PATH THROUGH THAT GLOOMY CHAOS CALLED HISTORY OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND TO LOOK FACE TO FACE UPON THE SAME MAY PERHAPS TRY IT BY THIS METHOD AS HOPEFULLY AS BY ANOTHER
HER OLD WOMAN IN THE SAME PASSAGE IS OF COURSE A JOCULAR ALLUSION TO DOROTHY HERSELF
I AM TOLD THAT R
FOR THREE BUT TWAS TOO DEAR
BUT WERE IT REALLY IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY I COULD NOT MISS BEING SO MYSELF FOR I KNOW NOTHING ELSE I WANT TOWARDS IT
FOR THE TASTE ON'T AS IT IS NOT EXCELLENT SO TIS NOT VERY ILL
BUT TIS SUCH A ONE AS WILL NOT BECOME ANYTHING LESS THAN A LORD
I THINK I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW DEAR YOU HAVE BEEN TO ME NOR THAT IN YOUR KINDNESS I PLACED ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE
ALL THAT CAN BE PROMISED IS THAT SUCH ACCOUNT SHALL BE AS CONCISE AS MAY BE CONSISTENT WITH CLEARNESS AND ACCURACY AND THAT IT SHALL CONTAIN NOTHING BUT ASCERTAINED FACTS
THIS HOWEVER WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THEY BOTH MARRIED ELSEWHERE
I TAKE IT A LITTLE ILL THAT YOU SHOULD CONJURE ME BY ANYTHING WITH A BELIEF THAT TIS MORE POWERFUL WITH ME THAN YOUR KINDNESS
ONLY THERE IS THIS DIFFERENCE THAT AS ALL ARE MORE FORCIBLY INCLINED TO ILL THAN GOOD THEY ARE MUCH APTER TO EXCEED IN DETRACTION THAN IN PRAISES
DID YOU SEND THE LAST PART OF CYRUS TO MR HOLLINGSWORTH
AMONGST OTHER THINGS WHICH I DID NOT AT ALL MIND THEY FELL INTO A DISCOURSE OF FLYING
AND IF SHE BE NOT ENGAGED I SHALL GIVE HER NO CAUSE HEREAFTER TO BELIEVE THAT SHE IS A BURDEN TO ME THOUGH I HAVE NO EMPLOYMENT FOR HER BUT THAT OF TALKING TO ME WHEN I AM IN THE HUMOUR OF SAYING NOTHING
HAD SHE BEEN AN AMBITIOUS WOMAN ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORIANS WOULD HAVE STRIVEN TO DO JUSTICE TO HER CHARACTER IN BRILLIANT PERIODS AND THERE WOULD BE NO NEED AT THIS DAY FOR HER TO CLAIM HER PLACE AMONG THE CELEBRATED WOMEN OF ENGLAND
LOUIS AND DOROTHY ARE ALIKE DUST
I WOULD NOW IF I COULD TELL YOU WHEN I SHALL BE IN TOWN BUT I AM ENGAGED TO MY LADY DIANA RICH MY LORD OF HOLLAND'S DAUGHTER WHO LIES AT A GENTLEWOMAN'S HARD BY ME FOR SORE EYES THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY TILL SHE DOES
WHAT HE WRITES OF CHINA SEEMS TO BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT LATER WRITERS HAVE SAID
THOUGH YOU WILL NOT OWN IT FOR A PRESENT I'LL KEEP IT AS ONE AND TIS LIKE TO BE YOURS NO MORE BUT AS TIS MINE
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD-NATURED
SIR,--THAT YOU MAY BE AT MORE CERTAINTY HEREAFTER WHAT TO THINK LET ME TELL YOU THAT NOTHING COULD HINDER ME FROM WRITING TO YOU AS WELL FOR MY OWN SATISFACTION AS YOURS BUT AN IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING IT
THEREFORE I'LL MAKE HASTE TO TELL YOU THAT MY FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU MAKES ME CONCERNED IN ALL YOUR RELATIONS
MR BLUNT PRETENDED THAT SHE WAS CONTRACTED TO HIM FOR THE SAKE IT IS SAID OF GAINING MONEY THEREBY
AND IF YOU DARE TRUST ME WHERE I AM EQUALLY CONCERNED WITH YOU I SHALL TAKE HOLD OF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY EITHER ADMIT YOU HERE OR BRING ME NEARER YOU
BUT THAT I AM NOT WILLING TO EXCITE YOUR ENVY I WOULD TELL YOU HOW MANY LETTERS I HAVE DESPATCHED SINCE I ENDED YOURS
TUNBRIDGE WELLS THE LAST OF THE THREE WATERING-PLACES THAT DOROTHY MAY HAVE VISITED IS STILL FLOURISHING AND FASHIONABLE
YOU MUST PARDON ME I CANNOT BE RECONCILED TO IT IT HAS BEEN THE RUIN OF US BOTH
MY LADY ORMOND I AM TOLD IS WAITING FOR A PASSAGE AND DIVERS OTHERS
CAN YOU THINK IT NECESSARY TO ME OR BELIEVE THAT YOUR LETTERS CAN BE SO LONG AS TO MAKE THEM UNPLEASING TO ME
BEING SUCH AN ASSEMBLY OF WRETCHED JADES AND HACKNEY COACHES AS NEXT TO A REGIMENT OF CAR-MEN THERE IS NOTHING APPROACHES THE RESEMBLANCE
I HAVE SENT YOU MY PICTURE BECAUSE YOU WISHED FOR IT
SO THAT THOUGH IN AN ACTION ALREADY DONE WE CAN ONLY BE OUR OWN JUDGES BECAUSE WE ONLY KNOW WITH WHAT INTENTIONS IT WAS DONE YET IN ANY WE INTEND TIS SAFEST SURE TO TAKE THE ADVICE OF ANOTHER
BUT I FORGET MYSELF
THE SISTER TRUSTING TO THE TENDERNESS WHICH EVEN IN THOSE TROUBLED TIMES SCARCELY ANY GENTLEMAN OF ANY PARTY EVER FAILED TO SHOW WHERE A WOMAN WAS CONCERNED TOOK THE CRIME ON HERSELF AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SET AT LIBERTY WITH HER FELLOW-TRAVELLERS
LETTER 11._--IT IS A CURIOUS THING TO FIND THE LORD GENERAL'S SON AMONG OUR LOYAL DOROTHY'S SERVANTS
DO NOT BELIEVE SIR I BESEECH YOU THAT THE YOUNG HEIRS ARE FOR YOU
YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
THERE IS A GENTLEWOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY THAT LOVED SO PASSIONATELY FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS THAT HER FRIENDS WHO KEPT HER FROM MARRYING FEARING HER DEATH CONSENTED TO IT
I AM NOT APT TO SUSPECT WITHOUT JUST CAUSE BUT IN EARNEST IF I ONCE FIND ANYBODY FAULTY TOWARDS ME THEY LOSE ME FOR EVER
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS LITTLE ACCIDENT BUT BY TAKING NOTICE THAT I CANNOT FORBEAR TELLING YOU IT
I FORGOT ALL MY DISGUISE AND WE TALKED OURSELVES WEARY
BUT YOU MAY CHOOSE WHETHER YOU WILL BELIEVE ME OR NOT FOR TO SAY TRUTH I DO NOT MUCH BELIEVE MYSELF IN THAT POINT
THERE IS SAID TO BE A PICTURE THERE OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE,--A COPY OF LELY'S PICTURE
BUT IT IS A LITTLE PUZZLING TO THE MODERN MIND WITH PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF CHELSEA TO HEAR IT SPOKEN OF AS A SEAT OR ESTATE IN WESTMINSTER
I PAY NOTHING OF SADNESS TO THE MEMORY OF MY POOR BROTHER BUT I PRESENTLY DISPERSE IT WITH THINKING WHAT I OWE IN THANKFULNESS THAT TIS NOT YOU I MOURN FOR
YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST THAT HAS TOLD ME I KNEW BETTER WHAT QUALITY I WOULD NOT HAVE IN A HUSBAND THAN WHAT I WOULD
HE RECKONS MORE INCONVENIENCY THAN YOU DO THAT FOLLOWS GOOD NATURE SAYS IT MAKES ONE CREDULOUS APT TO BE ABUSED BETRAYS ONE TO THE CUNNING OF PEOPLE THAT MAKE ADVANTAGE ON'T AND A THOUSAND SUCH THINGS WHICH I HEAR HALF ASLEEP AND HALF AWAKE AND TAKE LITTLE NOTICE OF UNLESS IT BE SOMETIMES TO SAY THAT WITH ALL THESE FAULTS I WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT IT
HE AFTERWARDS HELD AMONG OTHER OFFICES THAT OF CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND INDUCTED A VISITATION AND REFORM OF THAT UNIVERSITY
FOR THOUGH I WAS CONTENT FOR YOUR SAKE TO LOSE THEM AND ALL THE RESPECT THEY HAD FOR ME YET NOW I HAVE DONE THAT I'LL NEVER LET THEM SEE THAT I HAVE SO LITTLE INTEREST IN YOU AND YOURS AS NOT TO PREVAIL THAT MY BROTHER MAY BE ADMITTED TO TREAT FOR ME
WOULD YOU AND I WERE OUT OF IT
AND I HAVE LIVED SO LONG IN THE WORLD AND SO MUCH AT MY OWN LIBERTY THAT WHOSOEVER HAS ME MUST BE CONTENT TO TAKE ME AS THEY FIND ME WITHOUT HOPE OF EVER MAKING ME OTHER THAN I AM
TIS NOT A MELANCHOLY HUMOUR GIVES ME THESE APPREHENSIONS AND INCLINATIONS NOR THE PERSUASIONS OF OTHERS
HERE'S ANOTHER GOOD SIDE I FIND
ARE YOU NOT WEARY
IT WILL HELP US TO DISCOVER WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THE FRIENDS IN LONDON
THE STATUTE COMMANDING THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE WAS PASSED IN AUGUST 1653
FOR THIS INSTANCE OF MALIGNANCY THE WHOLE PARTY WERE ARRESTED AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR
AND SHE WAS SO KIND AND IN SO GOOD HUMOUR THAT IF I HAD HAD ANY COMMISSION I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A VERY FIT TIME TO SPEAK
SIR THOMAS PEYTON BROTHER PEYTON WAS BORN IN 1619 BEING I BELIEVE THE SECOND BARONET OF THAT NAME
YET I WILL HOPE MY EYES DO NOT DECEIVE ME AND THAT I HAVE NOT FORGOT TO READ
I SELDOM DREAM OR NEVER REMEMBER THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN SO SAD AS TO PUT ME INTO SUCH DISORDER AS I CAN HARDLY RECOVER WHEN I AM AWAKE AND SOME OF THOSE I AM CONFIDENT I SHALL NEVER FORGET
I KNOW NOT HOW TO BELIEVE I SHOULD MISUSE YOUR HEART AS YOU PRETEND
BUT I SHALL TALK TREASON BY AND BY IF I DO NOT LOOK TO MYSELF
EVELYN TELLS US THAT CROMWELL SHUT UP THE SPRING GARDENS IN 1600 AND KNIGHT THINKS THEY WERE CLOSED UNTIL THE RESTORATION IN WHICH SMALL MATTER WE MAY ALLOW DOROTHY TO CORRECT HIM
LORD HOW I HAVE WISHED FOR YOU
HE WOULD EXPECT HIS MISTRESS SHOULD RISE AGAIN TO REPROACH HIS INCONSTANCY IF HE MADE COURT TO ANYTHING BUT HER MEMORY
BUT TO DEAL FREELY WITH YOU THAT WERE TO BETRAY MYSELF AND I FIND THAT MY PASSION WOULD QUICKLY BE MY MASTER AGAIN IF I GAVE IT ANY LIBERTY
IF I WERE IN TOWN I'LL UNDERTAKE HE WOULD VENTURE THE BEING CHOKED FOR WANT OF AIR RATHER THAN STIR OUT OF DOORS FOR FEAR OF MEETING ME
I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MY OWN FOLLY THAT LET ME TO CHOOSE A FRIEND THAT COULD BE FALSE
SIR,--WHO WOULD BE KIND TO ONE THAT REPROACHES ONE SO CRUELLY
CHAPTER II EARLY LETTERS
BUT TIS WONDERFUL TO SEE WHAT CURTSEYS AND LEGS PASS BETWEEN US
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL SEE THE TOWN BEFORE MICHAELMAS THEREFORE YOU MAY MAKE WHAT SALLIES YOU PLEASE
ONE THAT BEFORE HE HAS HAD ME A WEEK SHALL USE ME WITH CONTEMPT AND BELIEVE THAT THE FAVOUR WAS OF HIS SIDE
BUT SHE WAS SO GOOD A COMPANION THAT SHE WOULD NOT FORSAKE HER COMPANY
OH IF YOU DO NOT SEND ME LONG LETTERS THEN YOU ARE THE CRUELLEST PERSON THAT CAN BE
YOU MAY DISCERN THE HASTE I'M IN BY MY WRITING
CRIES OUT ON ME FOR REFUSING HIM AND CHOOSING HIS CHAMBER-FELLOW
THESE ARE SHORTLY THE FACTS WHICH REMAIN TO US OF THE LIFE OF HENRY CROMWELL DOROTHY'S FAVOURED SERVANT
IF HE TAKES IT ILL THAT MY BROTHER APPEARS SO VERY AVERSE TO THE MATCH I MAY DO SO TOO THAT HE WAS THE SAME
TIS TRUE THAT NOBODY MUST IMAGINE TO THEMSELVES EVER TO BE ABSOLUTE MASTER ON'T BUT THERE IS GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THAT AND YIELDING TO IT BETWEEN STRIVING WITH IT AND SOOTHING IT UP TILL IT GROWS TOO STRONG FOR ONE
345
ARTAMENES OR LE GRAND CYRUS THE MASTERPIECE OF MADEMOISELLE MADELEINE DE SCUDERI IS CONTAINED IN NO LESS THAN TEN VOLUMES EACH OF WHICH IN ITS TURN HAS MANY BOOKS
DO BUT ASSURE ME THAT I SHALL FIND YOU ALMOST AS MERRY AS MY LADY ANNE WENTWORTH IS ALWAYS AND NOTHING SHALL FRIGHT ME FROM MY PURPOSE OF SEEING YOU AS SOON AS I CAN WITH ANY CONVENIENCY
BUT I WILL NOT SAY THE LOSS KNOWING WHOM I WRITE TO WHOSE RELIGION AND WISDOM IS A PRESENT STAY TO SUPPORT IN ALL WORLDLY ACCIDENTS
THE SECOND MRS WRIGHT SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A TASTE FOR ASTROLOGY AND CONSULTED SOME OF THE QUACKS WHO THEN PREYED ON THE SILLY WOMEN OF THE CITY
I THINK I HAD BEST MAKE THEM INTO FAGGOTS THIS COLD WEATHER THE FLAME THEY WOULD MAKE IN A CHIMNEY WOULD BE OF MORE USE TO ME THAN THAT WHICH WAS IN THE HEARTS OF ALL THOSE THAT GAVE THEM ME AND WOULD LAST AS LONG
LETTER 50._--WREST IN BEDFORDSHIRE WHERE DOROTHY MET HER IMPORTUNATE LOVER WAS THE SEAT OF ANTHONY GREY EARL OF KENT
BUT I SHOULD NEVER DESIGN TO PLEASE ABOVE ONE
JANE TOLD ME T'OTHER DAY VERY SOBERLY THAT WE WRITE VERY MUCH ALIKE
HE PUBLISHED CLEOPATRE IN 1642
IN THIS IGNORANCE YOUR LETTER FROM BREDA FOUND ME
LETTER 66._--"THE LOST LADY IS A TRAGI-COMEDY BY SIR WILLIAM BERKELY AND IS ADVERTISED TO BE SOLD AT THE SHOP OF THE HOLY LAMB IN THE YEAR 1639 WHICH WE MAY TAKE AS THE PROBABLE DATE OF ITS PUBLICATION
YET IT IS POSSIBLE ALL THAT HE SAYS MAY NOT BE SO FOR I HAVE KNOWN BETTER MEN THAN HE LIE
THE SPECIMEN WHICH MR COURTENAY HAS PRESERVED OF THESE EARLY COMPOSITIONS IS BY NO MEANS CONTEMPTIBLE
I WAS FAIN TO SAY YOU CAME ONLY TO TAKE YOUR LEAVE BEFORE YOU WENT ABROAD
WHEN HE WAS A PRISONER AFTER WORCESTER FIGHT SHE MADE HIM BELIEVE HE WAS IN GREAT DANGER OF HIS LIFE AND THAT SHE SAVED IT BY HER INTRIGUES WITH CROMWELL WHICH WAS NOT A LITTLE TAKEN NOTICE OF
TO SAY TRUTH I DO NOT LOVE TO THINK ON'T I FIND SO MANY THINGS TO FEAR AND SO FEW TO HOPE
HE IS MUCH OF YOUR SISTER'S HUMOUR AND MANY TIMES WISHES ME A HUSBAND THAT LOVED ME AS WELL AS HE DOES THOUGH HE SEEMS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY ON'T BUT NEVER DESIRES THAT I SHOULD LOVE THAT HUSBAND WITH ANY PASSION AND PLAINLY TELLS ME SO
I TELL THEM I SHALL BE WISER THEN
THEN HE SAT HALF-AN-HOUR AND SAID NOT ONE WORD NOR I TO HIM
AND I BELIEVE THE ACCIDENTS OF MY LIFE WOULD WORK MORE UPON ANY OTHER THAN THEY DO UPON ME WHOSE HUMOUR IS ALWAYS MORE PREPARED FOR THEM THAN THAT OF GAYER PERSONS
BUT THEN I MUST BORROW IT FOR TIS NO MORE MINE IF YOU LIKE IT BECAUSE MY BROTHER IS OFTEN BRINGING PEOPLE INTO MY CLOSET WHERE IT HANGS TO SHOW THEM OTHER PICTURES THAT ARE THERE
GOOD MRS HUTCHINSON CALLS HIM A DEBAUCHED UNGODLY CAVALIER WITH OTHER SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS OF PRESBYTERIAN ABHORRENCE
BUT NOT WITHOUT MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW THEY WOULD BE RECEIVED BY A PEOPLE THIRSTING TO READ THE DETAILS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE
HE KEEPS HIS BED AND NEVER RISES BUT TO HAVE IT MADE AND MOST TIMES FAINTS WITH THAT
THE ELDER BAGSHAWE DIED IN 1662 AND WAS BURIED AT MORTON PINCKNEY IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE
THE VAVASOURS WERE A ROMAN CATHOLIC FAMILY AND CLAIMED DESCENT FROM THOSE WHO HELD THE ANCIENT OFFICE OF KING'S VALVASOUR
NO THAT SHOWS A WANT OF CONSTANCY WHICH YOU WILL HARDLY YIELD TO BE YOUR FAULT
DANVERS MY LADY DIANA SHOULD NOT IF I COULD HELP IT AS WELL AS I LOVE HER
AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT IN MY DEBT BUT THINK THE SAME OF ME
A RIGHT WORTHY SON-IN-LAW OF GOOD SIR PETER
YOU WILL BE SO KIND I AM SURE AS TO WRITE BACK BY THE COACH AND TELL ME WHAT THE SUCCESS OF YOUR JOURNEY SO FAR HAS BEEN
THE LOSS PUT ME HUGELY OUT OF ORDER AND YOU WOULD HAVE BOTH PITIED AND LAUGHED AT ME IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN HOW WOODENLY I ENTERTAINED THE WIDOW WHO CAME HITHER THE DAY BEFORE AND SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH
COLONEL IN IRELAND WITH HIS FATHER IN 1649
THE WOMAN AT SOMERSET HOUSE WAS CRIED UP MIGHTILY
THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
I TOOK TIME ENOUGH TO HAVE COINED MYSELF SOME MONEY IF I HAD HAD THE ART ON'T AND LEFT MY BROTHER ENOUGH TO MAKE ALL HIS ADDRESSES TO HER IF HE WERE SO DISPOSED
THERE WAS SOME DEBATE SAYS WHITELOCKE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE STYLED COMMISSIONERS OR LORDS COMMISSIONERS AND THOUGH THE WORD LORDS WAS FAR LESS ACCEPTABLE AT THIS TIME THAN FORMERLY YET THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SEEM TO LESSEN THEIR OWN AUTHORITY NOR THE HONOUR OF THEIR OFFICE CONSTITUTED BY THEM THEY VOTED THE TITLE TO BE LORDS COMMISSIONERS SIR,--IF WANT OF KINDNESS WERE THE ONLY CRIME I EXEMPTED FROM PARDON TWAS NOT THAT I HAD THE LEAST APPREHENSION YOU COULD BE GUILTY OF IT
AFTER DINNER WE SIT AND TALK TILL MR B
AND AS A JUST PUNISHMENT UPON ME FROM THAT HOUR TO THIS I COULD NEVER LEARN WHOM THOSE RINGS WERE FOR NOR WHAT WAS IN THE LETTER BESIDES
MR ARBRY WAS PROBABLY WILLIAM ERBURY VICAR OF ST MARY'S CARDIFF A NOTED SCHISMATIC
NEXT WEEK MY PERSECUTION BEGINS AGAIN
AND WOULD HAVE STUCK AT NOTHING BY WHICH SHE MIGHT COMPASS HER ENDS
NO PRAY LET IT BE YOUR FATHER'S COMMANDS OR A NECESSITY YOUR FORTUNE PUTS UPON YOU
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEARNT ANY OF THESE FINE THINGS FROM YOU
SINCE HE HAS DECREED IT OTHERWISE AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE ARE ABLE TO JUDGE BY EVENTS WE MUST SUBMIT AND NOT BY STRIVING MAKE AN INNOCENT PASSION A SIN AND SHOW A CHILDISH STUBBORNNESS
HE DIED NOVEMBER 2 1628 AND WAS BURIED IN CAMPTON CHURCH,--CHICKSANDS LIES BETWEEN THE VILLAGE OF HAWNES AND CAMPTON,--WHERE A TABLET TO HIS MEMORY STILL EXISTS
YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT YOU ARE SOME LETTERS IN MY DEBT BESIDES THE ANSWER TO THIS
I THINK THAT WILL BE BEST
THEN I MADE THEM CHOOSE AGAIN FOR THEIRS AND MY NAME WAS LEFT
I AM SURE I HAVE NO ENDS TO SERVE OF MY OWN IN WHAT I DID,--IT COULD BE NO ADVANTAGE TO ME THAT HAD FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO MARRY
ALGERNON SYDNEY'S FATHER THE EARL OF LEICESTER WHOSE JOURNAL HAS ALREADY BEEN QUOTED UNDER DATE WEDNESDAY APRIL 20TH 1653 WRITES AS FOLLOWS:--"MY LORD GENERAL CAME INTO THE HOUSE CLAD IN PLAIN BLACK CLOTHES WITH GREY WORSTED STOCKINGS AND SAT DOWN AS HE USED TO DO IN AN ORDINARY PLACE THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK AND PRESENTLY HE PUT ON HIS HAT WENT OUT OF HIS PLACE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE STAGE OR FLOOR IN THE MIDST OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND CHID THEM SOUNDLY AFTER THIS HAD GONE ON FOR SOME TIME COLONEL HARRISON WAS CALLED IN TO REMOVE THE SPEAKER WHICH HE DID
TIS THE PLEASANTEST THING THAT CAN BE TO HEAR US DISCOURSE
SHE WAS THE SECOND DAUGHTER OF THOMAS CAREY ONE OF THE EARL OF MONMOUTH'S SONS AND READERS MAY BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT SHE DID MARRY SIR HENRY LITTLETON
I SHALL BE EVEN WITH HER SOME TIME OR OTHER BUT FOR THE PRESENT I LONG FOR HER WITH SOME IMPATIENCE THAT SHE MAY TELL ME ALL YOU HAVE TOLD HER
I NEVER RESOLV'D TO GIVE YOU AN ETERNAL FAREWELL BUT I RESOLV'D AT THE SAME TIME TO PART WITH ALL THE COMFORT OF MY LIFE AND WHETHER I TOLD IT YOU OR NOT I SHALL DIE YOURS
MY LORD SAYE I AM TOLD HAS WRIT A ROMANCE SINCE HIS RETIREMENT IN THE ISLE OF LUNDY AND MR WALLER THEY SAY IS MAKING ONE OF OUR WARS WHICH IF HE DOES NOT MINGLE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASING FICTION CANNOT BE VERY DIVERTING SURE THE SUBJECT IS SO SAD
HOW DO THOSE THAT LIVE WITH THEM ALWAYS
THEY WILL NOT SPARE THEIR MONEY BUT ARE RESOLVED--AT LEAST THE STATES OF HOLLAND--IF THE REST WILL CONSENT TO RAISE FOURTEEN REGIMENTS OF FOOT AND SIX OF HORSE
BUT I AM SORRY TO TELL IT YOU THEY SAY TIS THE MOST ILL-FAVOURED CREATURE THAT EVER WAS BORN
ENGLAND IS AGAIN AT PEACE WITH HERSELF AND TAKES HER POSITION AS ONE OF THE GREAT POWERS OF EUROPE
THE EMPEROR AND HIS PROPOSALS BEGAN IT
IN EARNEST I HAVE PITIED YOUR SISTER EXTREMELY AND CAN EASILY APPREHEND HOW TROUBLESOME THIS VOYAGE MUST NEEDS BE TO HER BY KNOWING WHAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN TO ME
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY PROFESSORS OF THE BLACK ART AT THIS DATE AND LILLY STUDIED UNDER ONE EVANS A SCOUNDRELLY EX-PARSON FROM WALES UNTIL ACCORDING TO LILLY'S OWN ACCOUNT HE DISCOVERED EVANS TO BE THE CHEAT HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS
AND HENRY CROMWELL PROMISED THAT THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARIES AT DUBLIN SHOULD BE SET TO WORK TO PROCURE HER A FINE IRISH GREYHOUND
BUT THE STORY OF MADEMOISELLE DE TOURNON IS SO SAD THAT WHEN I HAD READ IT I WAS ABLE TO GO NO FURTHER AND WAS FAIN TO TAKE UP SOMETHING ELSE TO DIVERT MYSELF WITHAL
HE HAD MORE WIT THEN THAN HE HAS NOW I THINK AND I HAVE LESS WIT THAN HE SURE FOR SPENDING MY PAPER UPON HIM WHEN I HAVE SO LITTLE
AND THAT YOU WILL OBLIGE ME IN LETTING ME KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR ANY GOOD NEWS FROM HIM
BUT I CAN GET MR GIBSON IF YOU WILL TO BRING YOU A LETTER
I'LL WARRANT YOU WOULD NE'ER HAVE THOUGHT OF MAKING ME A PRESENT OF CHARCOAL AS MY SERVANT JAMES WOULD HAVE DONE TO WARM MY HEART I THINK HE MEANT IT
BUT MARK YOU
SURE SHE IS EXCELLENT COMPANY
SOMETIMES I SAY NOT YET AND THEY LAUGH MORE AND WOULD MAKE ME BELIEVE I SHALL BE OLD WITHIN THIS TWELVEMONTH
WHEN I CONSIDER HOW SMALL A PROPORTION OF HAPPINESS IS ALLOWED IN THIS WORLD AND HOW GREAT MINE WOULD BE IN A PERSON FOR WHOM I HAVE A PASSIONATE KINDNESS AND WHO HAS THE SAME FOR ME
AND IT IS CERTAIN THE ACTION THAT IS BUT INDIFFERENT AND WITHOUT REWARD IF DONE ONLY UPON OUR OWN CHOICE IS AN ACTION OF DUTY AND OF RELIGION AND REWARDABLE BY THE GRACE AND FAVOUR OF GOD IF DONE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COMMAND OF OUR SUPERIORS LITTLE AND GREAT BRICKHILL WHERE TEMPLE IS TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM DOROTHY KINDLY FAVOURED BY MR GIBSON STAND DUE WEST OF CHICKSANDS SOME SEVENTEEN MILES AND ABOUT FORTY-SIX MILES ALONG THE HIGH-ROAD FROM LONDON TO CHESTER
THERE IS A LETTER OF HERS WRITTEN TO HER FATHER WHICH SHOWS SOME SIGNS OF HER MOTHER'S AFFECTIONATE TEACHING AND WHICH WE CANNOT FORBEAR TO QUOTE
NOTHING IS SO GREAT A VIOLENCE TO ME AS THAT WHICH MOVES MY COMPASSION
TIS STRANGE THAT YOU TELL ME OF MY LORDS SHANDOYS CHANDOS AND ARUNDEL
AND ALL THE PROBABLE CONJECTURES THAT CAN BE RAISED FROM THENCE HAS BEEN URGED TO SEE IF ANYTHING WOULD BE CONFESSED
DOROTHY'S YOUNGEST BROTHER IS LATELY DEAD
WE SEE OLD FOLKS WHO HAVE OUTLIVED ALL THE COMFORTS OF LIFE DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN IT AND NOTHING CAN WEAN US FROM THE FOLLY OF PREFERRING A MORTAL BEING SUBJECT TO GREAT INFIRMITY AND UNAVOIDABLE DECAYS BEFORE AN IMMORTAL ONE AND ALL THE GLORIES THAT ARE PROMISED WITH IT
I AM SORRY MY NEW CARRIER MAKES YOU RISE SO EARLY TIS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR COLD
I CAN HEAR NOTHING OF THAT LETTER BUT I HEAR FROM ALL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW PART OF MY UNHAPPY STORY AND FROM SOME THAT I DO NOT KNOW
WERE YOU AT ALTHORP WHEN YOU SAW MY LADY SUNDERLAND AND MR SMITH OR ARE THEY IN TOWN
TIS TRUE SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT THAT HAVE NOT WIT BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST AS MANY FOOLISH PEOPLE I HAVE EVER OBSERVED TO BE FULLEST OF TRICKS LITTLE UGLY PLOTS AND DESIGNS UNNECESSARY DISGUISES AND MEAN CUNNINGS WHICH ARE THE BASEST QUALITIES IN THE WORLD AND MAKES ONE THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE I THINK
IN ALL THINGS ELSE PRAY SAY I AM HIS SERVANT
YOU WILL NOT COMPLAIN I BELIEVE OF THE SHORTNESS OF MY LAST WHATEVER ELSE YOU DISLIKE IN IT AND IF I SPARE YOU AT ANY TIME TIS BECAUSE I CANNOT BUT IMAGINE SINCE I AM SO WEARISOME TO MYSELF THAT I MUST NEEDS BE SO TO EVERYBODY ELSE THOUGH AT PRESENT I HAVE OTHER OCCASIONS THAT WILL NOT PERMIT THIS TO BE A LONG ONE
BUT TIS NO MATTER FOR AS I REMEMBER IT WAS NOT MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AND BESIDES I HAVE PAPER LITTLE ENOUGH LEFT TO CHIDE YOU FOR ASKING SO UNKIND A QUESTION AS WHETHER YOU WERE STILL THE SAME IN MY THOUGHTS
I HAVE SLEPT AS LITTLE AS YOU AND MAY BE ALLOWED TO TALK AS UNREASONABLY YET I FIND I AM NOT QUITE SENSELESS
WHAT LITTLE COULD BE GLEANED OF HIS ACTIONS FROM AMONGST KENTISH ANTIQUITIES AND HISTORY AND SUCH LETTERS OF HIS AS LIE ENTOMBED IN THE MSS
AND THAT WOULD KILL ME WERE I AS SHE FOR I COULD BE INFINITELY BETTER SATISFIED WITH A HUSBAND THAT HAD NEVER LOVED ME IN HOPES HE MIGHT THAN WITH ONE THAT BEGAN TO LOVE ME LESS THAN HE HAD DONE
YOU ARE A VERY PRETTY GENTLEMAN AND A MODEST
IS NOT THIS KIND
IF THEY ARE NOT YOURS NEVER WILL BE SO TO ME
IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT MONK HAS A BROTHER LIVES IN CORNWALL
THESE ARE BOLD WORDS BUT THEY ARE HIS OWN
LETTER 4._--THE STORY OF THE KING WHO RENOUNCED THE LEAGUE WITH HIS TOO FORTUNATE FRIEND IS TOLD IN THE THIRD BOOK OF HERODOTUS
WE ARE NOT ACCURATELY INFORMED RESPECTING TEMPLE'S MOVEMENTS DURING THAT TIME
I CANNOT PITY NEITHER OF THEM THEY WERE BOTH SO GUILTY
AND ABOVE ALL THINGS HERE IS A LIVING PRESENTMENT OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN PURE IN DISSOLUTE DAYS PASSING QUIET HOURS OF DOMESTIC LIFE AMONGST HER OWN FAMILY WHERE WE MAY ALL VISIT HER AND HEAR HER VOICE EVEN IN THE VERY TONES IN WHICH SHE SPOKE TO HER LOVER
BUT MAYBE THIS WAS BEFORE YOU WENT AND SO IS NO NEWS TO YOU
CHAPTER V THE LAST OF CHICKSANDS
THAT YOU HAD THE INVISIBLE RING OR FORTUNATUS HIS WISHING HAT
AND WOULD IT BE ANY ADVANTAGE TO YOU TO HAVE YOUR WIFE THOUGHT AN INDISCREET PERSON
AND THOUGH I SEE AS LITTLE COMPANY AS ANYBODY THAT COMES THERE YET I ALWAYS MET WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT KEPT ME IDLE
AT THE RATE OF OUR YOUNG NOBILITY HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AND REMARKABLE FOR AN EXCELLENT HUSBAND
BUT I AM ALTOGETHER OF YOUR MIND THAT MY LADY SUNDERLAND IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED IN HER MARRYING FASHION AND THAT MR SMITH NEVER APPEAR'D LESS HER SERVANT THAN IN DESIRING IT
THE DIVISION OF THE LETTERS INTO CHAPTERS AT FIRST SIGHT AN ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENT REALLY FOLLOWS THEIR NATURAL GROUPING
TIS LIKE PEOPLE THAT TALK IN THEIR SLEEP NOTHING INTERRUPTS THEM BUT TALKING TO THEM AGAIN AND THAT YOU ARE NOT LIKE TO DO AT THIS DISTANCE
FOR MRS PAYNTER IN COVENT GARDEN
BUT IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY FOR YOU I SHOULD THINK MYSELF STRANGELY UNFORTUNATE IN BEING THE CAUSE THAT IT WENT NOT FURTHER
BUT IF BY MY OWN FOLLY I HAD PUT IT UPON MYSELF THE CASE WOULD BE EXTREMELY ALTERED
NO WOMAN BREATHING CAN DESERVE HALF THE TROUBLE YOU GIVE YOURSELF
EVELYN TOO IS ALREADY MAKING NOTES IN HIS JOURNAL AT PARIS AND ELSEWHERE
I MAKE HER PLAY AT SHUTTLECOCK WITH ME AND SHE IS THE VERIEST BUNGLER AT IT EVER YOU SAW
TIS A PRETTY FREEDOM SHE TAKES BUT YOU MAY THANK YOURSELF
ONE MAY BE HAPPY TO A GOOD DEGREE I THINK IN A FAITHFUL FRIEND A MODERATE FORTUNE AND A RETIRED LIFE
BUT SINCE I CANNOT HAVE HIM WOULD YOU HAD HER
R
TAKE HEED OF TELLING ME SUCH STORIES
IT WILL I THINK THROW GREAT LIGHT ON HIS CHARACTER AS A LOVER SHOWING HIM TO HAVE BEEN ARDENT AND ECSTATIC IN HIS SUIT MAKING QUITE CLEAR DOROTHY'S WISDOM IN INSISTING AS SHE OFTEN DOES ON THE NECESSITY OF SOME MORE MATERIAL MARRIAGE PORTION THAN MERE LOVE AND HOPE
THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUP OF LETTERS BOTH FROM THE NUMBER OF LETTERS CONTAINED IN IT AND THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTERS THEMSELVES IS THAT ENTITLED LIFE AT CHICKSANDS 1653 THE EDITOR REGARDS THIS GROUP AS THE VERY MAINLAND OF THE EPISTOLARY ARCHIPELAGO THAT WE ARE EXPLORING
I KNOW NOT HOW HE MAY BE PREJUDICED AS TO THE BUSINESS BUT HE IS NOT DEAF TO REASON WHEN TIS CIVILLY DELIVERED AND IS AS EASILY GAINED WITH COMPLIANCE AND GOOD USAGE AS ANYBODY I KNOW BUT BY NO OTHER WAY
I NEVER HAD I THINK BUT ONE LETTER FROM SIR JUSTINIAN BUT TWAS WORTH TWENTY OF ANYBODY'S ELSE TO MAKE ME SPORT
NOTHING IS CIVIL BUT THAT AMONGST FRIENDS
I AM GLAD ALL IS WELL AGAIN
THOUGH MY BROTHER PEYTON WHO SAYS HE WILL COME DOWN TO FETCH HIS DAUGHTER HINDERS ME FROM MAKING THE JOURNEY IN COMPLIMENT TO HER
YOU TOLD ME OF WRITING TO YOUR FATHER BUT YOU DID NOT SAY WHETHER YOU HAD HEARD FROM HIM OR HOW HE DID
POOR JANE IS SICK BUT SHE WILL WRITE SHE SAYS IF SHE CAN
LOOK TO IT
AND IF ONE COULD NOT DATE EACH LETTER ONE COULD AT LEAST ASSIGN GROUPS OF LETTERS TO SPECIFIC MONTHS OR SEASONS OF THE YEAR
BUT IF I BE DENIED IT YOU WILL TEACH ME TO CONSIDER MYSELF
I CAN PARDON IT HIM BECAUSE HE DOES NOT KNOW ME BUT I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU COULD DOUBT IT
SEE WHAT SHE EXPECTS IN A LOVER
AND TO DO THAT I MUST TELL YOU THAT UNLESS IT WERE AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THOSE LETTERS THAT MADE ME ANGRY I NEVER HAD THE LEAST HOPE OF WEARING OUT MY PASSION NOR TO SAY TRUTH MUCH DESIRE
THOUGH PERHAPS IT WILL ADMIT OF A GOOD SENSE TIS THAT WHICH NOBODY BUT YOU OR I WILL GIVE IT AND WE THAT ARE CONCERNED IN'T CAN ONLY SAY TWAS AN ACT OF GREAT KINDNESS AND SOMETHING ROMANCE BUT MUST CONFESS IT HAD NOTHING OF PRUDENCE DISCRETION NOR SOBER COUNSEL IN'T
THAT IF HE VALUES NOTHING BUT FORTUNE SHE DESPISES IT AND COULD LOVE YOU AS MUCH A BEGGAR AS SHE COULD DO A PRINCE
TEMPLE WOULD PROBABLY RETURN TO LONDON WHEN HE LEFT IRELAND AND LETTERS WOULD PASS FREQUENTLY BETWEEN THEM
YOUR FAITHFUL
THESE NOTES WERE EVIDENTLY WRITTEN UPON THE TRIVIAL OCCASIONS OF THE DAY MORE PERHAPS FOR THE SAKE OF WRITING SOMETHING THAN FOR ANY MORE SERIOUS REASON
BUT JANE TO WHOM YOU REFER ME IS NOT YET COME DOWN
ONE OF THE BEST BELOVED AND GENTLEST OF THESE WHO BY THE SATIRE OF HEAVEN WAS BORN INTO ENGLAND IN THESE TROUBLOUS TIMES WAS NOW WANDERING BY BROOK AND STREAM SCARCELY ANNOYED BY THE UPROAR AND CONFUSION OF THE FACTIONS AROUND HIM
LORD VALENTIA WAS AT THIS TIME SECRETARY OF STATE AT DUBLIN
LET ME PRACTISE THIS TOWARDS YOU AS WELL AS PREACH IT TO YOU AND I'LL LAY A WAGER YOU WILL APPROVE ON'T
AND YOU MAY KEEP IT IF YOU PLEASE TILL I BRING YOU THE ORIGINAL
I HAVE ANOTHER STORY FOR YOU
HOWSOEVER YOU DO OBLIGE ME BY NOT OWNING ANY SUCH THING FOR AS YOU SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO TAKE IT ILL THAT YOU ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE ME A LIBERTY THOUGH I'M NEVER LIKELY TO MAKE USE ON'T
ON JUNE 6TH THE OFFICIAL MERCURIUS POLITICUS SPEAKS OF THIS PLOT AS FOLLOWS:--"THE TRAITOROUS CONSPIRACY MENTIONED HERETOFORE IT APPEARS EVERY DAY MORE DESPERATE AND BLOODY
II
MAY I NEVER BE PLEASED WITH ANYTHING WHEN I DO NOT
SIR JOHN TUFTON OF THE MOTE NEAR MAIDSTONE MARRIED MARY THE THIRD DAUGHTER AND CO-HEIRESS OF THOMAS LORD WOTTON
HOW MERRY AND PLEASED SHE IS WITH HER MARRYING BECAUSE THERE IS A PLENTIFUL FORTUNE
MR WRIGHT MARRIED A THIRD WIFE AND SOON AFTERWARDS DIED LEAVING HIS WIDOW COMFORTABLY OFF
INTO A FIELD NEAR THE TOWN WHICH THEY CALL HYDE PARK,--THE PLACE NOT UNPLEASANT AND WHICH THEY USE AS OUR COURSE BUT WITH NOTHING THAT ORDER EQUIPAGE AND SPLENDOUR
SURE WHEN A THING OF COURSE AND SO MUCH REASON AS THAT UNLESS I DID DISCLOSE TO ALL THE WORLD HE WERE MY ENEMY IT MUST BE EXPECTED WHENSOEVER I DISPOSE OF MYSELF HE SHOULD BE MADE NO STRANGER TO IT
BUT THIS MARRIAGE WAS MOST CERTAINLY NOT DECLARED UNTIL 1653 M
I COULD SAY A GREAT DEAL TO THIS PURPOSE AND TELL YOU THAT TIS NOT DISCREET TO REFUSE A GOOD OFFER NOR SAFE TO TRUST WHOLLY TO YOUR OWN JUDGMENT IN YOUR DISPOSAL
PRESENTLY AFTER THIS WAS AT AN END MY MOTHER DIED AND I WAS LEFT AT LIBERTY TO MOURN HER LOSS AWHILE
HE SAYS TWOULD PITY YOU TO HEAR WHAT SAD COMPLAINTS HE MAKES
YOU SHALL NEVER PERSUADE ME I SEND YOU THIS JOURNEY
I WAS MORE CAVALIER THAN ROUND-HEAD AND SO TAKEN NOTICE OF
YOU NEED NOT SEND ME MY LADY NEWCASTLE'S BOOK AT ALL FOR I HAVE SEEN IT AND AM SATISFIED THAT THERE ARE MANY SOBERER PEOPLE IN BEDLAM
AND HE IS SO SENSIBLE OF MY CARE OVER HIM THAT HE IS PLEASED WITH NOBODY ELSE AND FOLLOWS ME AS IF WE HAD BEEN OF LONG ACQUAINTANCE
THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL CHARACTER OF ALL STATESMEN OF ALL DATES AND IN ALL AGES REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR OF ENVIOUS OPPOSITION
BUT WHETHER SHE WILL GET IT WHEN SHE COMES THERE IS I THINK A QUESTION
LORD
LORD
LETTER 39._--DOROTHY HAS BEEN IN LONDON SINCE HER LAST LETTER BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS EITHER NOT MET WITH TEMPLE OR HE HAS LEFT TOWN SUDDENLY WHILST SHE WAS THERE ON SOME UNEXPLAINED ERRAND
ONLY TIS AS WELL WITHOUT AND WILL MAKE MY WEARING IT THE LESS OBSERVED
FOR I MARK THAT I AM ALWAYS OF YOUR OPINION UNLESS IT BE WHEN YOU WILL NOT ALLOW THAT YOU WRITE WELL FOR THERE I AM TOO MUCH CONCERNED
I AM NOT SO THOUGH
I READ IT OVER OFTEN ENOUGH TO MAKE IT EQUAL WITH THE LONGEST LETTER THAT EVER WAS WRIT AND PLEASED MYSELF IN EARNEST AS MUCH AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME IN THE HUMOUR I WAS IN TO THINK HOW BY THAT TIME YOU HAD ASKED ME PARDON FOR THE LITTLE REPROACHES YOU HAD MADE ME AND THAT THE KINDNESS AND LENGTH OF MY LETTER HAD MADE YOU AMENDS FOR THE TROUBLE IT HAD GIVEN YOU IN EXPECTING IT
AND MANY OF THEM APPEAR IN THESE VOLUMES
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER
AND TO DO THAT HE MUST HAVE THAT KIND OF BREEDING THAT I HAVE HAD AND USED THAT KIND OF COMPANY
TIS MORE THAN E'ER YOU DID I THINK YOU ARE SO NEGLIGENT ON'T AND KEEP IT SO ILL TIS PITY YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
SUMMER 1654 VII
FOR GOD'S SAKE WRITE ME ALL THAT YOU HEAR OR CAN THINK OF THAT I MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF WITHAL
I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE TO THINK HOW I SHALL WRITE OUT OF SUFFOLK TO YOU OR RECEIVE YOURS
FROM THIS DATE PASSING LIGHTLY OVER A HUNDRED TROUBLED YEARS WE FIND PETER OSBORNE DOROTHY'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER BORN IN 1521
WHO WAS THAT MR DR TOLD YOU I SHOULD MARRY
TIS THAT WHICH MAKES ALL THINGS ELSE SEEM NOTHING TO IT SO HIGH IT SETS ME
YOU ASK ME HOW I PASS MY TIME HERE
THIS WAS NOT MUCH TO MY ADVANTAGE NOR HARDLY CIVIL I THINK TO ANY WOMAN
THEREFORE I CAN EXCUSE IT THOUGH YOU DO NOT EXACTLY PAY ALL THAT YOU OWE UPON CONDITION YOU SHALL TELL ME WHEN I SEE YOU ALL THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE WRIT IF YOU HAD HAD TIME AND ALL THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE TO SAY TO A PERSON THAT IS YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND
OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT VALUE THE MAN AT ALL
FOR AS THOSE FIGURES JOINED SEVERAL WAYS THE FABRICK OF EACH SEVERAL CREATURE RAISE
IF SHE PLEASES TO PUT ANY TO IT I AM SURE IT WILL BE A BETTER THAN IT HAS HERE
THE HAGUE OCTOBER 31ST 1670
NICHOLAS BACON DYING WITHOUT ISSUE BEQUEATHED CODDENHAM VICARAGE WITH THE PICTURES AND PAPERS THEREIN TO THE REV
TEMPLE WAS APPARENTLY ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR SOME EMPLOYMENT AND WE HEAR AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS PROJECTED EXCURSIONS INTO FOREIGN LANDS
ALTHOUGH FEW OF THEM WERE DATED IT WAS FOUND POSSIBLE BY MINUTE ANALYSIS OF THEIR CONTENTS TO PLACE THEM IN APPROXIMATELY CORRECT ORDER
IF COURTENAY LIVED TO LEARN THAT THE WORLD HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO THAN PORE OVER DULL EXCERPTS FROM INHUMAN STATE PAPERS WE MAY PITY HIS AWAKENING
BUT OTHERWISE SHE WILL SUIT WELL ENOUGH WITH THE REST OF THE GREAT LADIES OF THE TIMES AND BECOME GREENWICH AS WELL AS SOME OTHERS DO THE REST OF THE KING'S HOUSES
HE SAYS IT WOULD NOT BE SO WELL FOR HIM NOR PERHAPS FOR ME THAT I SHOULD
WE TALKED OURSELVES WEARY SHE SAYS
SHE THINKS NOBODY IN GOOD HUMOUR UNLESS THEY LAUGH PERPETUALLY AS NAN AND SHE DOES WHICH I WAS NEVER GIVEN TO MUCH AND NOW I HAVE BEEN SO LONG ACCUSTOMED TO MY OWN NATURAL DULL HUMOUR THAT NOTHING CAN ALTER IT
HE KNEW SHE TOLD THE CAPTAIN HIS ORDERS BEST AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO UPON THEM WHICH SHE LEFT TO HIM TO FOLLOW AS HE THOUGHT FIT WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HER OR HER CHILDREN THE DUTCH AND ENGLISH COMMANDERS THEN PROCEEDED EACH UPON HIS OWN COURSE AND LADY TEMPLE WAS SAFELY LANDED IN ENGLAND THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF THIS INCIDENT IN A LETTER OF SIR CHARLES LYTTELTON TO VISCOUNT HATTON IN THE HATTON CORRESPONDENCE
STILL IT IS NECESSARY TO SAY ONCE FOR ALL THAT THERE ARE OCCASIONAL ERRORS IN THE PASSAGE,--AS WHERE MACAULAY MENTIONS THAT CHICKSANDS IS NO LONGER THE PROPERTY OF THE OSBORNES,--THOUGH HAPPILY NOT ONE OF THESE ERRORS IS IN ITSELF IMPORTANT
I WAS SO PLEASED TO SEE I HAD SO MUCH TO READ AND SO SORRY I HAD DONE SO SOON THAT I RESOLVED TO BEGIN THEM AGAIN AND HAD LIKE TO HAVE LOST MY DINNER BY IT
WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD SIR JUS MY BROTHER USED TO TELL HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT WITH ALL HIS WISDOM ANY WOMAN THAT HAD WIT AND DISCRETION MIGHT MAKE AN ASS OF HIM AND GOVERN HIM AS SHE PLEASED
I CANNOT TELL WHETHER IF THERE WERE A NECESSITY OF YOUR COMING I SHOULD NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE IT WHEN HE IS AT HOME AND RATHER EXPOSE HIM TO THE TROUBLE OF ENTERTAINING A PERSON WHOSE COMPANY HERE WOULD NOT BE PLEASING TO HIM AND PERHAPS AN OPINION THAT I DID IT PURPOSELY TO CROSS HIM THAN THAT YOUR COMING IN HIS ABSENCE SHOULD BE THOUGHT A CONCEALMENT
THOSE IN A WORD WHO HAVE TRAVELLED IN A LINCOLNSHIRE CARRIER'S CART HAVE I FANCY A MORE CORRECT IDEA OF DOROTHY'S POSTMEN AND THEIR CONVEYANCES THAN ANY I COULD QUOTE FROM AUTHORITY OR DRAW FROM IMAGINATION
AND I AM GROWN SO PROVIDENT THAT I WILL NOT LAY OUT MORE THAN I RECEIVE BUT I AM JUST WITHAL AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE MINE LONGER WHEN YOU PLEASE
IN EARNEST I WAS SO FRIGHTENED WITH YOUR SHORT LETTER AS YOU CANNOT IMAGINE AND AS MUCH TROUBLED AT THE CAUSE ON'T
GOOD-NIGHT
SIR PETER WAS IN HIS STRONGHOLD ON A ROCK IN THE SEA
CALL ME AND THINK ME WHAT YOU PLEASE
IF HE HAS SPREAD HIS OPINION IN THAT FAMILY I SHALL QUICKLY HEAR ON'T FOR MY COUSIN MOLLE IS NOW GONE TO KIMBOLTON TO MY LORD MANCHESTER AND FROM THERE HE GOES TO MOOR PARK TO MY COUSIN FRANKLIN'S AND IN ONE OR BOTH HE WILL BE SURE TO MEET WITH IT
IF SO I CAN ALLOW HIM TO HATE US AND LOVE WHICH SURE HAS SOMETHING OF DIVINE IN IT SINCE GOD REQUIRES IT OF US
AND HAVE A CARE OF YOURSELF THIS COLD WEATHER
DO YOU KNOW HIS SON MY COUSIN HARRY
HOW SHALL I LONG WHEN YOU ARE GONE YOUR JOURNEY TO HEAR FROM YOU
IF I HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON WHY YOU LIKE MY LETTERS BETTER IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE KINDER THAN HERS SUCH A WORD MIGHT HAVE UNDONE ME
I CUT THEM ALL EQUAL AND MADE THEM UP MYSELF BEFORE THEM AND BECAUSE I WOULD OWE IT WHOLLY TO MY GOOD FORTUNE IF I WERE PLEASED
I HAVE A LETTER FROM P WHO SAYS IN CHARACTER THAT YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM HIM THAT THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAS BEGUN A NEGOTIATION THERE BUT WHAT SUCCESS IN ENGLAND HE MAY HAVE HE KNOWS NOT
IF YOU LOVE ME YOU WILL
THE INHABITANTS OF THE ISLAND MORE COMFORTABLY SITUATED WERE A UNITED PARTY FOR THE PARLIAMENT
THOUGH THAT WAS NO PERFECT SCHOOL OF VIRTUE YET VICE THERE WORE HER MASK AND APPEARED SO UNLIKE HERSELF THAT SHE GAVE NO SCANDAL
BUT SERIOUSLY I MANY TIMES RECEIVE LETTERS FROM HIM THAT WERE THEY SEEN WITHOUT AN ADDRESS TO ME OR HIS NAME NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THEY WERE FROM A BROTHER
I AM SORRY TO HEAR HE LOOKS ILL THOUGH I THINK THERE IS NO GREAT DANGER OF HIM
DOROTHY HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER EXCELLENT WIT AND NOBLE CHARACTER WHICH SHE IS NEVER TIRED OF REPEATING
HE TELLS ME STILL OF A LITTLE TIME
AS FOR SIR JUSTINIAN WE ARE NOT TO THINK HE WAS ALREADY MARRIED
ON ONE OCCASION SHE WAS MOST HIGHLY PROVOKED BY THE WAY IN WHICH ONE OF HER BROTHERS SPOKE OF TEMPLE
A SEA VOYAGE IS WELCOME TO NO LADY
WELL SERIOUSLY EITHER RESOLVE TO HAVE MORE CARE OF YOURSELF OR I RENOUNCE MY FRIENDSHIP
SIR JOHN WAS TREASURER'S REMEMBRANCER IN THE EXCHEQUER FOR MANY YEARS DURING THE REIGN OF JAMES I AND WAS ALSO A COMMISSIONER OF THE NAVY
NOW AS MY YOUNG LADY HOLLAND SAYS I NEVER PRETENDED TO WIT IN MY LIFE BUT I CANNOT BE SATISFIED THAT THE WORLD SHOULD THINK ME A FOOL SO THAT ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU WILL BE TO PRESERVE A CONSTANT KINDNESS FOR YOU WHICH NOTHING SHALL EVER ALTER OR DIMINISH
THE MERCURIUS POLITICUS OF NOVEMBER 1653 GIVES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THE MATTERS THAT LED TO THE EXECUTION
THE FIRST DAY SHE CAME HITHER HE INTENDED IT SEEMS TO HAVE COME WITH HER BUT BY THE WAY CALLED IN TO SEE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND BID HER GO ON HE WOULD OVERTAKE HER BUT DID NOT COME TILL NEXT NIGHT AND THEN SO DRUNK HE WAS LED IMMEDIATELY TO BED WHITHER SHE WAS TO FOLLOW HIM WHEN SHE HAD SUPPED
I HAVE SIX TOMES ON'T HERE THAT I CAN LEND YOU IF YOU HAVE NOT
AND THOUGH TIS MANY YEARS SINCE ONE MAY READ IT IN HIS FACE STILL
BUT THERE IS SUCH A WANT OF SOMETHING TO SAY THAT I CATCH AT EVERYTHING
THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE PRESENT-DAY CARRIERS IN SOME UNAWAKENED MARKET-PLACE IN THE MIDLANDS,--HEAVY RUMBLING TWO-HORSE CARS OF HUGE CAPACITY WHOSE THREE MILES AN HOUR IS FAST BECOMING TOO SLUGGISH FOR THEIR ENFRANCHISED CLIENTS
BUT LEST YOU SHOULD THINK I HAVE AS MANY WORMS IN MY HEAD AS HE I'LL GIVE OVER IN TIME AND TELL YOU HOW FAR MR LUKE AND I ARE ACQUAINTED
IF YOU COME HITHER YOU MUST EXPECT TO BE CHIDDEN SO MUCH THAT YOU WILL WISH THAT YOU HAD STAYED TILL WE CAME UP WHEN PERHAPS I MIGHT HAVE ALMOST FORGOT HALF MY QUARREL TO YOU
I HEAR NOTHING THAT IS WORTH YOUR KNOWING
BUT LITTLE PRATTLING PEPYS HAS NOT YET BEGUN DIARY-MAKING
I CAN EASILY GUESS WHO THE PRETTY YOUNG LADY IS FOR THERE ARE BUT TWO IN ENGLAND OF THAT FORTUNE AND THEY ARE SISTERS BUT I AM TO SEEK WHO THE GALLANT SHOULD BE
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN FORMING OUR ESTIMATE OF HER CHARACTER WE HAVE AN EXTENDED SERIES OF LETTERS BEFORE US
AND TO LET YOU SEE THAT I BELIEVE IT SO I WILL GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AND BEGIN MY STORY AS YOU DID YOURS FROM OUR PARTING AT GORING HOUSE
HE RENOUNCED ME AND I DEFIED HIM BUT BOTH IN AS CIVIL LANGUAGE AS IT WOULD PERMIT AND PARTED IN GREAT ANGER WITH THE USUAL CEREMONY OF A LEG AND A COURTESY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DIED WITH LAUGHING TO HAVE SEEN US
BUT IF YOUR FATHER OUT OF HUMOUR SHALL REFUSE TO TREAT WITH SUCH FRIENDS AS I HAVE LET THEM BE WHAT THEY WILL IT MUST END HERE
BUT ALL THIS IS NOTHING TO MY COMING TO TOWN YOU'LL SAY
I SHALL GO OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEK AND SO CANNOT POSSIBLY GET A PICTURE DRAWN FOR YOU TILL I COME UP AGAIN WHICH WILL BE WITHIN THESE SIX WEEKS BUT NOT TO MAKE ANY STAY AT ALL
LETTER 51._--LADY NEWPORT WAS THE WIFE OF THE EARL OF NEWPORT AND MOTHER OF LADY ANNE BLUNT OF WHOM WE HEARD SOMETHING IN FORMER LETTERS
HE MADE NO PROFICIENCY EITHER IN THE OLD PHILOSOPHY WHICH STILL LINGERED IN THE SCHOOLS OF CAMBRIDGE OR IN THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF WHICH LORD BACON WAS THE FOUNDER
T'OTHER WAS PLAIN GOLD WITH THE LONGEST AND THE STRANGEST POSY THAT EVER WAS
NEVER BELIEVE I HAVE A SERVANT THAT I DO NOT TELL YOU OF AS SOON AS I KNOW IT MYSELF
BUT PRAY LET IT NOT PRESUME TO DISTURB MY LADY SUNDERLAND'S
AND THOUGH I CAN NEVER REPENT THE SHARE YOU HAVE IN MY HEART I KNOW NOT WHETHER I GAVE IT YOU WILLINGLY OR NOT AT FIRST
YOUR KIND SISTER OUGHT TO CHIDE YOU TOO FOR NOT WRITING TO HER UNLESS YOU HAVE BEEN WITH HER TO EXCUSE IT
NAY I SHOULD HAVE CONCLUDED YOU INNOCENT AND HAVE IMAGINED A THOUSAND WAYS HOW IT MIGHT HAPPEN RATHER THAN HAVE SUSPECTED YOUR WANT OF KINDNESS
THEN I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO IN IT BUT TO EXPECT WHEN I SHALL BE SO HAPPY AS TO LEAVE IT AND ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THAT MY MISFORTUNE MAKES ALL MY FAULTS TOWARDS YOU AND THAT MY FAULTS TO GOD MAKE ALL MY MISFORTUNES
THE MEN THE GREATEST DRINKERS THAT EVER I SAW WHICH DID NOT AT ALL AGREE WITH MY BROTHER WHO WOULD NOT BE DRAWN TO IT TO SAVE A KINGDOM IF IT LAY AT STAKE AND NO OTHER WAY TO REDEEM IT
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAD THE GRACE TO GO HEAR A SERMON UPON A WEEK DAY
IF YOU HEARD THE WISE DISCOURSE THAT IS BETWEEN US YOU WOULD SWEAR WE WANTED SLEEP
WHAT A MULTITUDE OF WILLOW GARLANDS I SHALL WEAVE BEFORE I DIE
SO I WRIT DOWN OUR THREE NAMES AND FOR MEN MR FISH JAMES B AND YOU
HERE IS A RING
IN ENGLAND IN 1648 WHEN HE WAS MEMBER FOR CHICHESTER HE CONCURRED WITH THE PRESBYTERIAN VOTE THEREBY CAUSING THE MORE ADVANCED SECTION TO LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AND HE WAS TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE OR SECLUDED TO USE THE ELEGANT PARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE OF THE DAY
THIS IS NEXT TO TELLING YOU WHAT I DREAMED AND WHEN I RISE BUT YOU HAVE PROMISED TO BE CONTENT WITH IT
I WAS TOLD BY ONE WHO PRETENDS TO KNOW HIM VERY WELL THAT NOTHING TEMPTED MY COUSIN OSBORNE TO MARRY HIS LADY SO MUCH AS THAT SHE WAS AN EARL'S DAUGHTER
METHINKS WE THREE THAT IS MY NIECE AND HE AND I DO BECOME THIS HOUSE THE WORST THAT CAN BE UNLESS I SHOULD TAKE INTO THE NUMBER MY BROTHER PEYTON HIMSELF TOO
I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO ACCUSTOM MYSELF TO THE NOISE ON'T AND MAKE IT AS EASY TO ME AS I CAN THOUGH I HAD MUCH RATHER IT WERE NOT TALKED OF TILL THERE WERE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF DISCOVERING IT AND YOU CAN OBLIGE ME IN NOTHING MORE THAN IN CONCEALING IT
HE IS SECOND TO NONE UPON EARTH
THE FEW REMAINING LETTERS DEAL WITH THE TREATY
BUT TIS NO MATTER SO YOU UNDERSTAND ME THOUGH NOBODY ELSE DO WHEN I SAY HOW MUCH I AM YOUR FAITHFUL
IT RATHER INCREASES MY DOUBTS AND I DURST TRUST YOUR FORTUNE ALONE RATHER THAN NOW THAT MINE IS JOINED WITH IT
OH ME BUT I HEARD TO-DAY YOUR COUSIN HAMMOND IS GOING THITHER TO BE IN LUDLOW'S PLACE
TIS NOT THAT I AM SAD FOR AS LONG AS YOU AND THE REST OF MY FRIENDS ARE WELL I THANK GOD I HAVE NO OCCASION TO BE SO BUT I NEVER APPEAR TO BE VERY MERRY AND IF I HAD ALL THAT I COULD WISH FOR IN THE WORLD I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD MAKE ANY VISIBLE CHANGE IN MY HUMOUR
THEY LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT A DISTANCE
SOME OUT OF PRIDE HAVE SEEMED TO CONTEMN ILL REPORTS WHEN THEY HAVE FOUND THEY COULD NOT AVOID THEM BUT NONE OUT OF STRENGTH OF REASON THOUGH MANY HAVE PRETENDED TO IT
THIS INCIDENT AS WAS NATURAL MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON TEMPLE
AND AS LORD LISLE WAS NOT TO GO TO SWEDEN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF TEMPLE'S BEING ATTACHED TO THE EMBASSY
I TAKE IT VERY KINDLY THAT YOUR FATHER ASKED FOR ME AND THAT YOU WERE NOT PLEASED WITH THE QUESTION HE MADE OF THE CONTINUANCE OF MY FRIENDSHIP
I AM SURE ROBIN C TOLD MY BROTHER OF IT SINCE I WAS LAST IN TOWN
SURE HE WILL THINK I HAVE A MOST EXTRAVAGANT FANCY
IF HE DOES NOT I'LL BEGIN TO PRACTISE ON HIM WHAT YOU SO OFTEN PREACHED TO ME TO NEGLECT THE REPORT OF THE WORLD AND SATISFY MYSELF IN MY OWN INNOCENCY
I'LL SWEAR I HAVE GREAT SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE MYSELF ON THE POINT AND AM MUCH AFRAID I AM NOT YOUR FRIEND IF I AM ANY PART OF THE OCCASION THAT HINDERS YOU FROM ACCEPTING IT
WERE IT NOT THAT YOU HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH ALREADY I WOULD COMPLAIN A LITTLE OF YOU
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO BE SO MELANCHOLY
HAVE A CARE OF ALL THE DESPATCH AND SECURITY THAT CAN BE IN OUR INTELLIGENCE
THIS WAS PROBABLY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE ALTERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT PLANS
COULD YOU NOT STAY TILL THEY ARE ALL GONE TO ROEHAMPTON
WHETHER LORD AND LADY LEICESTER WERE AS DOROTHY SAYS IN GREAT DISORDER AT THIS TIME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
AT BARNET THERE WAS A CALCAREOUS SPRING WITH A SMALL PORTION OF SEA SALT IN IT WHICH AS WE MAY GATHER FROM A LATER LETTER HAD BEEN BUT RECENTLY DISCOVERED
I WAS SO WEARY ON'T THAT I MADE HASTE HOME AND COULD NOT BUT THINK OF THE CHANGE ALL THE WAY TILL MY BROTHER WHO WAS WITH ME THOUGHT ME SAD AND SO TO PUT ME IN BETTER HUMOUR SAID HE BELIEVED I REPENTED ME I HAD NOT THIS GENTLEMAN NOW I SAW HOW ABSOLUTELY HIS WIFE GOVERNED HIM
IF YOU WERE NOT SECURE IN ME YOU MIGHT BE SO IN HIM
AND YET I CANNOT TELL NEITHER THOUGH TIS NOT THE REMEDY I SHOULD CHOOSE WHETHER THAT WERE NOT A CERTAIN ONE FOR ALL MY MISFORTUNES
LETTER 16._--THE TRIAL OF LORD CHANDOS FOR KILLING MR COMPTON IN A DUEL WAS JUST AT THIS MOMENT EXCITING THE FICKLE ATTENTION OF THE TOWN WHICH HAD PROBABLY SAID ITS SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF CROMWELL'S COUP D'ETAT AND WAS ONLY TOO READY FOR ANOTHER SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
SIR PETER LELY DID PAINT A PORTRAIT OF LADY DIANA RICH SOME MONTHS AFTER THIS DATE
IT IS OF SOME INTEREST TO US TO REMEMBER THAT FRANCIS OSBORNE DOROTHY'S UNCLE HER FATHER'S YOUNGEST BROTHER WAS MASTER OF THE HORSE TO THIS GREAT NOBLEMAN
MY NEXT SHALL MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS SHORT ONE
IN MY JUDGMENT SHE IS WITHOUT DISPUTE THE FINEST LADY I KNOW ONE ALWAYS EXCEPTED
FROM WHAT HID STOCK DOES THY STRANGE NATURE SPRING
AND THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE IS DETERMINED IF THE COMMAND BE EVIDENT AND PRESSING
HE WAS PURSUED TAKEN PRISONER AND KEPT IN THE TOWER UNTIL AFTER THE KING'S EXECUTION
THE OLD BALLAD THAT DOROTHY ENCLOSES TO HER LOVER HAS NOT BEEN PRESERVED WITH HER LETTER
I DO NOT DOUBT BUT I SHALL BE BETTER ABLE TO RESIST HIS IMPORTUNITY THAN HIS TUTOR WAS
THAT I MAY BOAST OF WITH TRUTH AND MODESTY SINCE TIS BUT A SIMPLE VIRTUE
WHEN DO YOU THINK OF COMING BACK AGAIN
WHAT IS THE REASON
YOU WILL MEET WITH A STORY IN THESE PARTS OF CLEOPATRE THAT PLEASED ME MORE THAN ANY THAT EVER I READ IN MY LIFE
BUT HOW FEW WOULD DO IT THEN
SINCE DINNER THEY ARE ALL GONE AND OUR COMPANY WITH THEM PART OF THE WAY AND WITH MUCH ADO I GOT TO BE EXCUSED THAT I MIGHT RECOVER A LITTLE SLEEP BUT AM SO MOPED YET THAT SURE THIS LETTER WILL BE NONSENSE
SURE MY LADY CAREY CANNOT NEITHER IN HONOUR NOR CONSCIENCE KEEP IT
IF ANY ACCIDENT OUT OF MY POWER SHOULD BRING ME TO NECESSITY THOUGH NEVER SO GREAT I SHOULD NOT DOUBT WITH GOD'S ASSISTANCE BUT TO BEAR IT AS WELL AS ANYBODY AND I SHOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED ON'T IF HE PLEASED TO SEND IT ME
ONLY YOU AND I AGREE TIS TO BE FOUND BY US IN A TRUE FRIEND A MODERATE FORTUNE AND A RETIRED LIFE
I WAS IN HOPE SHE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME ONE FROM YOU
THE ORIGINAL OF IT IS AT CHICKSANDS TO SIR JOHN OSBORNE THANKING HIM FOR HIS CONSOLATION ON THE DEATH OF HER SON SHEEN MAY 6TH 1689
BUT THE MISCHIEF IS THAT WHAT MY INTENTIONS OR RESOLUTIONS ARE IS NOT TO BE DISCOVERED THOUGH MUCH PAINS HAS BEEN TAKEN TO COLLECT ALL SCATTERING CIRCUMSTANCES
THE LORDS MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PEERAGE JUSTICE ROLLES BEING LORD CHIEF JUSTICE BUT THEY DECLINED IT BY THE ADVICE OF MR MAYNARD AND THE REST OF THEIR COUNSEL LEAST BY THAT MEANS THE MATTER MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT AGAIN THEREFORE THEY WENT UPON THE FORMER VERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER AND SO WERE ACQUITTED
HERE IS AN IRREGULAR ROW OF BEACON FIRES ONCE ALL LUMINOUS AS SUNS
IF YOUR FATHER WOULD BUT IN SOME MEASURE SATISFY MY FRIENDS THAT I MIGHT BUT DO IT IN ANY JUSTIFIABLE MANNER YOU SHOULD DISPOSE ME AS YOU PLEASED CARRY ME WHITHER YOU WOULD ALL PLACES OF THE WORLD WOULD BE ALIKE TO ME WHERE YOU WERE AND I SHOULD NOT DESPAIR OF CARRYING MYSELF SO TOWARDS HIM AS MIGHT DESERVE A BETTER OPINION FROM HIM
MY BROTHER URGED THEM AGAINST ME ONE DAY IN A DISPUTE WHERE HE WOULD NEEDS MAKE ME CONFESS THAT NO PASSION COULD BE LONG LIVED AND THAT SUCH AS WERE MOST IN LOVE FORGOT THAT EVER THEY HAD BEEN SO WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED
IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO REMEMBER THAT LORD CHANDOS WAS KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN A DUELIST
AND WERE IT NOT FOR SOME CRUEL THOUGHTS OF THE CROSSNESS OF OUR FORTUNES THAT WILL NOT LET ME SLEEP THERE I SHOULD FORGET THAT THERE WERE SUCH A THING TO BE DONE AS GOING TO BED
OH MY CONSCIENCE
FOR HE IS OF OPINION THAT ALL PASSIONS HAVE MORE OF TROUBLE THAN SATISFACTION IN THEM AND THEREFORE THEY ARE HAPPIEST THAT HAVE LEAST OF THEM
I DO NOT SEE THAT IT PUTS ANY VALUE UPON MEN WHEN WOMEN MARRY THEM FOR LOVE AS THEY TERM IT
THE PREACHING WOMAN AT SOMERSET HOUSE WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY MRS HANNAH TRUPNEL
LETTER 67._--ELIZABETH QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WAS THE DAUGHTER OF JAMES I
ALACK
CAN THERE BE A ROMANCER STORY THAN OURS WOULD MAKE IF THE CONCLUSION PROVE HAPPY
BUT NOT TO DISPUTE THIS WITH YOU LET ME TELL YOU THAT I AM THUS FAR OF YOUR OPINION THAT UPON SOME NATURES NOTHING IS SO POWERFUL AS KINDNESS AND THAT I SHOULD GIVE THAT TO YOURS WHICH ALL THE MERIT IN THE WORLD BESIDES WOULD NOT DRAW FROM ME
FOR IF HE HAD LOVED HER AS HE OUGHT TO DO I CANNOT HOPE HE SHOULD LOVE ANOTHER SO WELL AS I EXPECT ANYBODY SHOULD THAT HAS ME
YOU ARE ENOUGH IN MY HEART TO KNOW ALL MY THOUGHTS AND IF SO YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH I AM YOURS
AND TO THAT END IF YOUR OCCASIONS WILL SERVE COME DOWN TO CANTERBURY
WHAT THINK YOU WERE IT NOT A GOOD WAY OF PREFERMENT AS THE TIMES ARE
HE RAISED A REGIMENT AND FOUGHT UNDER ESSEX AT EDGEHILL RECONQUERED LINCOLNSHIRE AND TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF MARSTON MOOR
SHE LIES WITH HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE NAVE OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY CLOSE TO THE LITTLE DOOR THAT LEADS TO THE ORGAN GALLERY
WHAT WOULD I GIVE THAT I HAD A LATIN LETTER OF HIS FOR YOU THAT HE WRIT TO A GREAT FRIEND AT OXFORD WHERE HE GIVES HIM A LONG AND LEARNED CHARACTER OF ME
I OFTEN DREAM I DO
I'LL LEAVE YOU FOR I FIND THESE THOUGHTS BEGIN TO PUT ME IN ILL HUMOUR
I CALL HEAVEN TO WITNESS THAT IF MY LIFE COULD SATISFY FOR THE LEAST INJURY MY FORTUNE HAS DONE YOU I CANNOT SAY TWAS I THAT DID THEM YOU I WOULD LAY IT DOWN WITH GREATER JOY THAN ANY PERSON EVER RECEIVED A CROWN
I BELIEVE HE UNDOES HIMSELF WITH PRINTING HIS TRANSLATIONS
TIS SAFER TALKING OF THE ORANGE-FLOWER WATER YOU SENT ME
PERHAPS IT WAS THIS LETTER AND WHAT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT IT THAT CAUSED ALL THOSE LATENT FEELINGS OF DESPAIR AND DISCONTENT TO AWAKEN IN THE BREASTS OF THE TWO LOVERS
I CAN GIVE YOU A PERFECT ACCOUNT NOT ONLY OF WHAT I DO FOR THE PRESENT BUT OF WHAT I AM LIKELY TO DO THIS SEVEN YEARS IF I STAY HERE SO LONG
SHE SHALL HAVE TWO SPOTS CARRIAGE DOGS IF SHE PLEASE FOR I HAD JUST SUCH ANOTHER GIVEN ME AFTER YOU WERE GONE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS IN THE POWER OF YOURS
THUS YOU SEE TIS NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT REASON THAT I APPREHEND THE NOISE OF THE WORLD SINCE TIS SO MUCH TO MY DISADVANTAGE
HE RENOUNCED ME AND I DEFIED HIM NEAR SEVEN YEARS DID THIS ARDUOUS WOOING CONTINUE
FOR YOU ARE NOT MUCH BETTER BY YOUR OWN RELATION
REMEMBER MY RING AND IN RETURN IF I GO TO LONDON WHILST YOU ARE IN IRELAND I'LL HAVE MY PICTURE TAKEN IN LITTLE AND SEND IT YOU
DOROTHY HAS APPARENTLY TIRED OF CALPRENEDE AND SCUDERI OF CLEOPATRE AND CYRUS AND HAS TURNED TO TRAVELS TO AMUSE HER
WHEN THIS MOOD IS OVER IT IS OVER FOR EVER AND WE EMERGE INTO A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE OF HOPE AND CONTENT
FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME HEAR OF ALL YOUR MOTIONS WHEN AND WHERE I MAY HOPE TO SEE YOU
IN EARNEST I AM LOST SOMETIMES WITH THINKING ON'T
THE FRENCHMAN THAT SET MY SEALS LIVES BETWEEN SALISBURY HOUSE AND THE EXCHANGE AT A HOUSE THAT WAS NOT FINISHED WHEN I WAS THERE AND THE MASTER OF THE SHOP HIS NAME IS WALKER HE MADE ME PAY 50S
BUT PERHAPS I LIKE IT THE WORSE FOR HAVING A PIECE OF CYRUS BY ME THAT I AM HUGELY PLEASED WITH AND THAT I WOULD FAIN HAVE YOU READ
I WAS SORRY BUT I DID NOT MUCH WONDER AT IT BECAUSE HE GAVE SO LITTLE TIME AND RESOLVED TO MAKE MY BEST OF THAT I HAD BY COLLINS
NO MATTER AND I HAD NOT DONE IT THEN SINCE IT PROVES NO BETTER
BESIDES THAT THEY WERE STILL SO MUCH FRENCH IN WORDS AND PHRASES THAT TWAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS NOT FRENCH TO MAKE ANYTHING OF THEM
AND IT PROVED SO
IN EARNEST NOW GO AS SOON AS YOU CAN TWILL BE THE BETTER I THINK WHO AM YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND
I HAD FORGOT IN MY OTHER TO TELL YOU WHAT JANE REQUIRES FOR THE SATISFACTION OF WHAT YOU CONFESS YOU OWE HER
QUESTIONS STILL UNSETTLED
ONLY I SHOULD BE AS LITTLE PLEASED WITH THE CONSTRAINT OF MY BROTHER'S HOUSE AS YOU
BUT SINCE YOU TELL ME THEY WERE REMARKABLY SO SURE I KNOW THEM BY IT
AN HONEST GENTLEMAN I HAVE HEARD AND ONE THAT WAS A GREAT ACQUAINTANCE OF A BROTHER OF MINE WHO WAS KILLED THERE DURING THE WAR AND SO MUCH HIS FRIEND THAT UPON HIS DEATH HE PUT HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY INTO MOURNING FOR HIM WHICH IS NOT USUAL I THINK WHERE THERE IS NO RELATION OF KINDRED
AND ONE MAY NOT BE OVERSTEPPING THE MODEST AND JOHNSONIAN LIMITS OF AN EDITOR'S OFFICE WHEN THE WRITING OF A SHORT INTRODUCTION IS INCLUDED AMONG THE DUTIES OF PREPARATION
IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND FOUND IN ENGLAND
THEY GO THIS MORNING
BUT I AM MORE SORRY TO SEE BY YOUR FIRST CHAPTER THAT YOUR HUMOUR IS NOT ALWAYS SO GOOD AS I COULD WISH IT
I KNOW YOU WOULD THOUGH I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT SO MUCH AT LEISURE AS I USED TO BE
LETTER 36._--MY LADY CARLISLE WAS AS DOROTHY SAYS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY PERCY EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AGAINST HER FATHER'S WILL AND UNDER SOMEWHAT ROMANTIC CIRCUMSTANCES MARRIED JAMES HAY EARL OF CARLISLE
THAT HOUSE OF YOUR COUSIN R IS FATAL TO PHYSICIANS
EVERY LITTLE STORM OF WIND FRIGHTS ME SO THAT I PASS HERE FOR THE GREATEST COWARD THAT EVER WAS BORN THOUGH IN EARNEST I THINK I AM AS LITTLE SO AS MOST WOMEN YET I MAY BE DECEIVED TOO FOR NOW I REMEMBER ME YOU HAVE OFTEN TOLD ME I WAS ONE AND SURE YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF HEART MINE IS BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
NO IN EARNEST I THINK NAY I'M SURE I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER AND TIS THAT ONLY GIVES ME THESE DESPAIRING THOUGHTS
BESIDES THAT AT THIS INSTANT YOU ARE I BELIEVE MORE ASLEEP THAN I AND DO NOT SO MUCH AS DREAM THAT I AM WRITING TO YOU
WHO COUSIN PETERS WAS WE CANNOT NOW SAY BUT SHE WAS EVIDENTLY A RELATION AND A GOSSIP
AND IN EARNEST I AM NOT CERTAIN WHETHER HE WOULD LOSE IT OR NOT FOR IT GIVES HIM A LAWFUL OCCASION OF BEING NICE AND CAUTIOUS ABOUT HIMSELF TO WHICH HE IN HIS OWN HUMOUR IS SO MUCH INCLINED THAT TWERE NOT EASY FOR HIM TO FORBEAR IT
WHEN WE HAVE TRIED ALL WAYS TO HAPPINESS THERE IS NO SUCH THING TO BE FOUND BUT IN A MIND CONFORMED TO ONE'S CONDITION WHATEVER IT BE AND IN NOT AIMING AT ANYTHING THAT IS EITHER IMPOSSIBLE OR IMPROBABLE
BESIDES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD KEEP IT LONG FOR HERE IS MY ELDEST BROTHER AND MY COUSIN MOLLE AND TWO OR THREE MORE THAT HAVE GREAT UNDERSTANDING IN AGUES AS PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH THEM AND THEY DO SO TUTOR AND GOVERN ME THAT I AM NEITHER TO EAT DRINK NOR SLEEP WITHOUT THEIR LEAVE
NOW WHAT THINK YOU SHALL I EVER HEAR OF HIM MORE
ITS GROUNDS STOOD MUCH IN THE POSITION OF THE PRESENT ARLINGTON STREET AND EVELYN SPEAKS OF IT AS AN ILL-BUILT HOUSE BUT CAPABLE OF BEING MADE A PRETTY VILLA
WE HEAR SOME LITTLE MORE OF HIM FROM DOROTHY
I AM AFRAID SHE IS NOT AND SORRY THAT THOSE SHE HAS ARE SO GENERALLY KNOWN
AND WE NEED NOT THEREFORE BE SURPRISED TO FIND LADY VAVASOUR ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS PLOTS THAT SURROUNDED AND ENDANGERED THE PROTECTOR'S POWER
INDEED I COULD NOT HELP IT NOR CANNOT NOW BUT IF THAT WILL SATISFY I CAN ASSURE YOU I SHALL MAKE A MUCH BETTER WIFE THAN I DO A HUSBAND IF I EVER AM ONE
WHAT A PLEASANT DISTINCTION YOU MAKE WHEN YOU SAY THAT TIS NOT MELANCHOLY MAKES YOU DO THESE THINGS BUT A CARELESS FORGETFULNESS
MY BROTHER SAYS NOT A WORD OF YOU NOR YOUR SERVICE NOR DO I EXPECT HE SHOULD
I COULD HAVE WISHED THEN THAT HE HAD CONSIDERED ME LESS AND MY NIECE MORE
ALL LETTERS METHINKS SHOULD BE FREE AND EASY AS ONE'S DISCOURSE
BUT I CONFESS I DO NOT LIKE TO GIVE UNCERTAIN HOPES BECAUSE I DO NOT CARE TO RECEIVE THEM
HE MIGHT HAVE SPED BETTER IN HIS SUIT IF HE HAD MADE COURT TO ME AS WELL AS TO MY LADY RUTHIN
LETTER 58._--DOROTHY IS NOW IN LONDON STAYING PROBABLY WITH THAT AUNT WHOM SHE MENTIONED BEFORE AS ONE WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO FIND HER A HUSBAND OTHER THAN TEMPLE
DOROTHY OSBORNE IS PASSING AWAY WILL SOON BE TRANSLATED INTO DOROTHY TEMPLE
SHE WOULD READ THESE IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH
I SHALL EXPECT THE RELATION FROM YOU AT YOUR BEST LEISURE AND PRAY GIVE ME AN ACCOUNT HOW MY MEDICINE AGREES WITH YOUR COLD
SOME OF THEM HAVE INDEED BEEN PRINTED IN A LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS PEREGRINE COURTENAY A MAN BETTER KNOWN TO THE TORY POLITICIAN OF FIFTY YEARS AGO THAN TO ANY WORLD OF LETTERS IN THAT DAY OR THIS
TEMPLE SOON BECAME IN THE PHRASE OF THAT TIME HER SERVANT AND SHE RETURNED HIS REGARD
BETHAM WITH THAT OPTIMISM WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF COMPILERS OF PEERAGES THINKS THAT HE WAS ESTEEMED ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED PERSONS OF THE TIME BEING A GENTLEMAN NOT ONLY OF FINE LEARNING BUT FAMED FOR HIS PIETY AND EXEMPLARY LIFE DOROTHY THINKS OTHERWISE AND WRITES OF HIM AS THE VAINEST IMPERTINENT SELF-CONCEITED LEARNED COXCOMB THAT EVER YET I SAW PEERAGES IN DOROTHY'S STYLE WOULD PERHAPS BE UNPROFITABLE WRITING
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE NOT MORTIFIED ENOUGH FOR SUCH DISCOURSE TO WORK UPON THOUGH I AM NOT OF MY BROTHER'S OPINION NEITHER THAT YOU HAVE NO RELIGION IN YOU IN EARNEST I NEVER TOOK ANYTHING HE EVER SAID HALF SO ILL AS NOTHING SURE IS SO GREAT AN INJURY
LETTER 56._--TEMPLE HAS REACHED DUBLIN AT LAST AND BEGINS TO WRITE FROM THERE
THEY TELL ME TWILL NOT LEAVE ME COMMON SENSE THAT I SHALL HARDLY BE FIT COMPANY FOR MY OWN DOGS AND THAT IT WILL END EITHER IN A STUPIDNESS THAT WILL MAKE ME INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING OR FILL MY HEAD WITH SUCH WHIMS AS WILL MAKE ME RIDICULOUS
HOW COULD YOU HEAR ME TALK SO SENSELESSLY THOUGH TWERE BUT IN YOUR SLEEP AND NOT BE READY TO BEAT ME
THERE'S NOTHING SO TERRIBLE IN MY OTHER LETTER BUT YOU MAY VENTURE TO READ IT
AS MY LAST REFUGE I GOT MY BROTHER TO GO DOWN WITH HIM TO SEE HIS HOUSE WHO WHEN HE CAME BACK MADE THE RELATION I WISHED
WERE I AS SHE I SHOULD HIDE MYSELF FROM ALL THE WORLD
TIS ORDINARY GRIEFS THAT MAKE ME WEEP
THEN HE SHALL LEAVE ME HE SAYS NOT OUT OF WANT OF KINDNESS TO ME BUT BECAUSE HE CANNOT SEE THE RUIN OF A PERSON THAT HE LOVES SO PASSIONATELY AND IN WHOSE HAPPINESS HE HAS LAID UP ALL HIS
I AM CALLED UPON FOR MY LETTER BUT MUST HAVE LEAVE FIRST TO REMEMBER YOU OF YOURS
IF SHE HAD KNOWN I HAD CONSENTED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO FILL UP A BOX SHE WOULD HAVE CONDEMNED ME EXTREMELY
BUT YET HOW WILLINGLY WOULD I VENTURE ALL TO BE WITH YOU
GRANTED THEN TO ONE RICHARD SNOW OF WHOM THE RECORDS ARE SILENT
I DARE NOT SEND MY BOY TO MEET YOU AT BRICKHILL NOR ANY OTHER OF THE SERVANTS THEY ARE ALL TOO TALKATIVE
I HAVE NO ROOM FOR MORE THAN YOUR
IN EARNEST HE'S A PRETTY GENTLEMAN AND HAS A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD NATURE I THINK WHICH MAY OBLIGE HIM PERHAPS TO SPEAK WELL OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES WITHOUT DESIGN
WREST PARK IS ONLY A FEW MILES FROM CHICKSANDS
IF I AM SO AT ALL IT IS IN BEING YOUR LETTER 15._--WHAT TEMPLE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT MR ARBRY'S PROPHECY AND THE FALLING DOWN OF THE FORM WE CANNOT KNOW
LORD MANCHESTER WAS EDWARD MONTAGU SECOND EARL OF MANCHESTER
IN 1646 HE RESIGNED HIS COMMAND
A THING DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND UNTIL WE REMEMBER THAT FIELDING THE FIRST AND GREATEST ENGLISH NOVELIST WAS YET UNBORN AND NOVELS AS WE KNOW THEM NON-EXISTING
BUT HE STAYED TO TELL ME I WAS HIS VALENTINE
POOR LADY ANNE PERCY DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND NIECE OF THE FAITHLESS LADY CARLISLE OF WHOM WE READ IN THESE LETTERS WAS ALREADY MARRIED AT THIS DATE TO LORD STANHOPE LORD CHESTERFIELD'S HEIR
THE LAST LETTER OF THIS CHAPTER WHICH IS DATED OCTOBER 2ND CALLS ON TEMPLE TO COME DOWN TO KENT TO PEYTON'S HOUSE
BEING THE AMOURS OF MILISTRATE AND PRAZIMENE ILLUSTRATED WITH VARIETY OF CHANCE AND FORTUNE
THE UBIQUITOUS EVELYN WAS THERE TOO TO SEE YE MARRIAGE OF MY OLD FELLOW COLLEGIAN MR ROBT
I DOUBT MUCH WHETHER ALL THIS BE SENSE OR NOT
HE WAS AN EMINENT LOYALIST AMONG THE FIRST OF THOSE NOBLES WHO LEFT WESTMINSTER AND AT NEWBURY FIGHT HAD HIS THREE HORSES KILLED UNDER HIM
IN EARNEST TIS A MOST SAD THING THAT A PERSON OF HER QUALITY SHOULD BE REDUCED TO SUCH A FORTUNE AS SHE HAS LIVED UPON THESE LATE YEARS AND THAT SHE SHOULD LOSE THAT WHICH SHE BROUGHT AS WELL AS THAT WHICH WAS HER HUSBAND'S
LORD THERE WERE A THOUSAND THINGS I REMEMBERED AFTER YOU WERE GONE THAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID AND NOW I AM TO WRITE NOT ONE OF THEM WILL COME INTO MY HEAD
BY THE CHARACTERISTIC TREACHERY OF THE KING WHO BEING UNABLE TO ASSIST HIM COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SENDING LYING PROMISES INSTEAD
BUT WHEN MY BROTHER DISPUTES IT WITH ME I HAVE OTHER ARGUMENTS FOR HIM AND I DROVE HIM UP SO CLOSE T'OTHER NIGHT THAT FOR WANT OF A BETTER GAP TO GET OUT AT HE WAS FAIN TO SAY THAT HE FEARED AS MUCH YOUR HAVING A FORTUNE AS YOUR HAVING NONE FOR HE SAW YOU HELD MY LORD L'T'S
BUT I HAVE BEEN SO USED TO MISFORTUNES THAT I CANNOT BE MUCH SURPRISED WITH THEM THOUGH PERHAPS I AM AS SENSIBLE OF THEM AS ANOTHER
THE OTHER A GENTLEMAN WHOSE MISTRESS DIED JUST WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE MARRIED
I CAN ASSURE YOU NOW THAT I SHALL BE HERE A FORTNIGHT LONGER THEY TELL ME NO LODGER UPON PAIN OF HIS HIGHNESS'S DISPLEASURE MUST REMOVE SOONER
IF ANYTHING COULD BE WONDER'D AT IN THIS AGE I SHOULD VERY MUCH HOW YOU CAME BY YOUR INFORMATIONS
WHAT CAN YOU IMAGINE WE DID THIS LAST WEEK WHEN TO OUR CONSTANT COMPANY THERE WAS ADDED A COLONEL AND HIS LADY A SON OF HIS AND TWO DAUGHTERS A MAID OF HONOUR TO THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA AND ANOTHER COLONEL OR A MAJOR I KNOW NOT WHICH BESIDES ALL THE TONGUE THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM
AT THIS DATE THERE WAS NO ADEQUATE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE ROYAL PARTY AND HER MAJESTY HAD TO LIVE IN TENTS ON THE BANKS OF THE SPRING
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE WITH THESE YOU SHALL HAVE THE REST AND I BELIEVE THEY WILL PLEASE
WHICH SINCE I FIND THEM HERE MORE IRRESOLUTE IN POINT OF TIME THOUGH NOT AS TO THE JOURNEY ITSELF THAN I HOPED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR QUARREL TO ME AND THE APPREHENSION YOU WOULD MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU HAD THAT I DO NOT CARE TO SEE YOU PRAY COME HITHER AND TRY WHETHER YOU SHALL BE WELCOME OR NOT
IT IS HARD TO SAY HOW AND WHERE HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHINESE WERE CARRIED ON AS HE HIMSELF ADMITS THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ONE WORD OF THE LANGUAGE
BUT MY LORD OF DORCHESTER THEY SAY HAS AND SO MIGHT I HAVE HAD IF I WERE AS RICH AS HE AND THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SURE OF ME AT THE TOWER;--NOW A WORSE LODGING MUST SERVE MY TURN
BUT I DID AND MADE HIM CONFESS SHE HAD BETTER HAVE MARRIED A BEGGAR THAN THAT BEAST WITH ALL HIS ESTATE
THE QUEEN TOOK THE GREATEST PAINS TO PERSUADE HER FROM IT THAT COULD BE
I COULD NEVER DISCERN BY ANYTHING THAT HE KNEW IT
THE TRIAL IS NOT REPORTED AMONG THE STATE TRIALS BUT OUR OBSERVANT FRIEND THE EARL OF LEICESTER HAS AGAIN TAKEN NOTE OF THE MATTER IN HIS JOURNAL AND CAN GIVE US AT LEAST HIS OWN IDEAS OF THE TRIAL AND ITS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IMPORTANCE
MR WALLER WHOM DOROTHY MAY HAVE KNOWN MR COWLEY SIR PETER LELY,--WHO PAINTED OUR HEROINE'S PORTRAIT,--AND DR JEREMY TAYLOR
I AM GLAD YOU STAY TO WAIT ON YOUR SISTER
LETTER 23 SIR,--I WILL TELL YOU NO MORE OF MY SERVANTS
TIS AN ADMIRABLE THING TO SEE HOW SOME PEOPLE WILL LABOUR TO FIND OUT TERMS THAT MAY OBSCURE A PLAIN SENSE
I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SOONER BUT THAT I DO NOT KNOW MYSELF WHAT COMPANY I MAY HAVE WITH ME
I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH MORE
A YACHT WAS SENT FOR LADY TEMPLE
MY LADY PEMBROKE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF CUMBERLAND
MRS GOLDSMITH MENTIONED IN A SUBSEQUENT LETTER,--WIFE OF DANIEL GOLDSMITH THE RECTOR OF CAMPTON IN WHICH PARISH CHICKSANDS WAS SITUATED,--ACTED AS CHAPERON OR DUENNA COMPANION TO DOROTHY AND JANE WAS IT SEEMS TO ME IN A SIMILAR POSITION
BUT SERIOUSLY MY FATHER IS NOW SO CONTINUOUSLY ILL THAT I HAVE HARDLY TIME FOR ANYTHING
BUT WHAT THOMAS I CANNOT IMAGINE FOR ALL THE SERVANTS I HAVE GOT SINCE I CAME HITHER I KNOW NONE OF THAT NAME
THE MANNER IS AS THE COMPANY RETURNS TO STOP AT THE SPRING GARDENS SO CALLED IN ORDER TO THE PARK AS OUR THUILLERIES IS TO THE COURSE
OR IF ALL THIS WILL NOT SATISFY MAKE YOUR OWN CONDITIONS SO YOU DO NOT RETURN IT ME BY THE SHORTNESS OF YOURS
SHE WRITES TO MR HUTTON TO ESCORT HER IN THE PARK ADDING--"THIS I AM SURE YOU WILL DO BECAUSE I AM A FRIEND TO THE TOBACCO-BOX AND SUCH I AM SURE MR HUTTON WILL HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THAN FOR ANY OTHER ACCOUNT THAT COULD BE PRETENDED UNTO BY YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THIS WITH DOROTHY'S PRAISE GIVES US A CHEERFUL OPINION OF LADY DIANA OF WHOM WE MUST ALWAYS WISH TO KNOW MORE
PERHAPS YOU WILL NOT THINK IT SO EASY TO DECIDE WHICH IS THE MOST UNHAPPY AS YOU MAY THINK BY THE TITLES THEIR STORIES BEAR
HE DIED IN 1714 AGED 88 AND WAS THEREFORE ABOUT 37 YEARS OF AGE AT THIS TIME
FOR TO SAY TRUTH HIS FOR ANOTHER SORT OF MELANCHOLY IS NOT LESS THAN OURS
LETTER 8._--THE NAME OF ALGERNON SYDNEY OCCURS MORE THAN ONCE IN THESE PAGES AND IT IS THEREFORE ONLY RIGHT TO REMIND THE READER OF SOME OF THE LEADING FACTS IN HIS LIFE
HER BODY SLEEPS IN CAPEL'S MONUMENT AND HER IMMORTAL PART WITH ANGELS LIVES
HERE THEY MAY BE WELCOME TO YOU FOR WANT OF BETTER COMPANY
I AM POSSESSED WITH THAT STRANGE INSENSIBILITY THAT MY NEAREST RELATIONS HAVE NO TIE UPON ME AND I FIND MYSELF NO MORE CONCERNED IN THOSE THAT I HAVE HERETOFORE HAD GREAT TENDERNESS OF AFFECTION FOR THAN IN MY KINDRED THAT DIED LONG BEFORE I WAS BORN
I KNOW NOT WHETHER I TOLD IT YOU OR NOT BUT I CONCLUDED FROM WHAT YOU SAID OF YOUR INDISPOSITION THAT IT WAS VERY LIKE THE SPLEEN
BUT OF THAT INFORMATION FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ALONE IT IS WORTH WHILE TO STUDY REMOTE EVENTS WE FIND SO MUCH IN THE LOVE LETTERS WHICH MR COURTENAY HAS PUBLISHED THAT WE WOULD GLADLY PURCHASE EQUALLY INTERESTING BILLETS WITH TEN TIMES THEIR WEIGHT IN STATE PAPERS TAKEN AT RANDOM
THEREFORE BE SECURE AND REST SATISFIED WITH WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU
I KNOW YOU LOVE ME STILL
BUT TIS NO MATTER I AM CONTENT YOU SHOULD KNOW THEY ARE OF YOU AND THAT WHEN MY THOUGHTS ARE LEFT MOST AT LIBERTY THEY ARE THE KINDEST
COMES IN QUESTION AND THEN I AM GONE
MY NIECE AND I WANDERED THROUGH SOME EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES OF WOOD IN SEARCH OF IT TO MAKE ROCKS AND STRANGE THINGS THAT HER HEAD IS FULL OF AND SHE ADMIRES IT MORE THAN YOU DID
YET A CHARACTER EVEN IN THE MOST DISTORTED VIEW TAKEN OF IT BY THE MOST ANGRY AND PREJUDICED MINDS GENERALLY RETAINS SOMETHING OF ITS OUTLINE
I HUMBLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR OFFER OF YOUR HEAD
SHE LOVED READING
THIS SYSTEM IS VERY FIT TO BE APPLIED TO DOROTHY'S LETTERS BECAUSE BY ITS USE DOROTHY IS LEFT TO TELL HER OWN STORY WITHOUT THE CONSTANT AND IRRITATING REFERENCES TO FOOTNOTES OR APPENDIX NOTES THAT OTHER ARRANGEMENTS NECESSITATE
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE WHAT THEY SAY THAT MY LORD LEICESTER AND MY LADY ARE IN GREAT DISORDER AND THAT AFTER FORTY YEARS PATIENCE HE HAS NOW TAKEN UP THE CUDGELS AND RESOLVED TO VENTURE FOR THE MASTERY
BUT PATIENCE,--WOULD ANYBODY BUT I WERE HERE
I HAVE NOT THANKED YOU YET FOR MY TWEEZERS AND ESSENCES
IS THERE ANY SUCH THING TOWARDS
IT WOULD BE VERY PARDONABLE IN YOU TO CHANGE BUT SURE IN HIM TIS A MARK OF SO GREAT INCONSTANCY AS SHOWS HIM OF AN HUMOUR THAT NOTHING CAN FIX
HE WAS NO SCHOLAR HAVING PASSED BUT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AT OXFORD WHEN HE WAS TAKEN THENCE AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH
THIS WAS WRITTEN WHEN I EXPECTED A LETTER FROM YOU HOW CAME I TO MISS IT
BUT THIS WIND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM
I WILL NOT HINDER YOUR COMING AWAY SO MUCH AS THE MAKING THIS LETTER A LITTLE LONGER MIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR TIME IN READING IT
SIR PETER WAS PRESUMABLY AT CASTLE CORNET AT THAT DATE BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL IF LADY OSBORNE EVER STAYED THERE THE ACCOMMODATION WITHIN ITS WALLS BEING STRAITENED AND PRIMITIVE EVEN FOR THAT DAY
I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE THE CONSTRAINT I LIVE IN WHAT ALARMS MY THOUGHTS GIVE ME AND YET HOW UNCONCERNED THIS COMPANY REQUIRES I SHOULD BE
IN THE MEANTIME THINK OF SOME EMPLOYMENT FOR YOURSELF THIS SUMMER
I KNOW NOT HOW HE MAY APPEAR IN A SWEDISH COURT BUT HE WAS NEVER MEANT FOR A COURTIER AT HOME I BELIEVE
BUT IF AS WE HAVE NOT DIFFERED IN ANYTHING ELSE WE COULD AGREE IN THIS TOO AND RESOLVE UPON A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL BE MUCH THE PERFECTER FOR HAVING NOTHING OF PASSION IN IT HOW HAPPY MIGHT WE BE WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A FEAR OF THE CHANGE THAT ANY ACCIDENT COULD BRING
HIS FATHER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHO SAYS SIR HENRY CHAUNCY MADE HIS HOUSE NEAT HIS GARDENS PLEASANT HIS GROVES DELICIOUS HIS CHILDREN CHEERFUL HIS SERVANTS EASY AND KEPT EXCELLENT ORDER IN HIS FAMILY SIR,--YOU ARE MORE IN MY DEBT THAN YOU IMAGINE
HE WAS ARRESTED TRIED AND EXECUTED IN 1683 ON THE PRETENCE OF BEING CONCERNED IN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT
WE ONLY WISH THAT THERE WERE TWICE AS MANY
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM REFERRING TO THIS BUSINESS
WHEN THE COURTSHIP COMMENCED THE FATHER OF THE HERO WAS SITTING IN THE LONG PARLIAMENT
TEMPLE WOULD PROBABLY ARRANGE TO STAY THERE RECEIVE DOROTHY'S LETTER AND SEND ONE IN RETURN
BUT TO COME TO MY BEAGLE AGAIN
AND THAT THIS CORRECTION MAY SUFFICE TO TEACH ME MY DUTY MUST BE THE PRAYER OF YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT AND HUMBLE SERVANT D
I AM CERTAIN HE COULD NOT HAVE HAD IT WHERE YOU IMAGINE AND TIS A MIRACLE TO ME THAT HE REMEMBER THAT THERE IS SUCH A ONE IN THE WORLD AS HIS COUSIN D.O
MY BROTHER SENT ME WORD THIS WEEK THAT MY FIGHTING SERVANT IS MARRIED TOO AND WITH THE NEWS THIS BALLAD WHICH WAS TO BE SUNG IN THE GRAVE THAT YOU DREAMT OF I THINK
HERE DO I SIT ALL NIGHT BY A POOR MOPED FELLOW THAT SERVES MY FATHER AND HAVE MUCH ADO TO KEEP HIM AWAKE AND MYSELF TOO
BUT YOU WILL PARDON MY UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE YOU AND NOTWITHSTANDING ALL YOUR LITTLE DOUBTS BELIEVE THAT I AM VERY MUCH YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT D
I BELIEVE I DO NOT SUFFER LESS IN'T THAN YOU BUT TIS NOT TO BE HELPED
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE CAN BE INDIFFERENT TO ANYBODY
SURE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE OLD OBSERVATION YOUR CHEEKS GLOWED NOTABLY
THE HEAT OF THE DAY IS SPENT IN READING OR WORKING AND ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN O'CLOCK I WALK OUT INTO A COMMON THAT LIES HARD BY THE HOUSE WHERE A GREAT MANY YOUNG WENCHES KEEP SHEEP AND COWS AND SIT IN THE SHADE SINGING OF BALLADS
BUT WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO EXPRESS MORE OF THE FIGURE THAN THE HEAD HIS DRAWING IS DEFECTIVE
HIS LIES ARE AS PLEASANT HARMLESS ONES AS LIES CAN BE AND IN NO GREAT NUMBER CONSIDERING THE SCOPE HE HAS FOR THEM
LADY SANDIS SANDYS WHO SEEMS SO FOND OF RACE MEETINGS AND OTHER LESS HARMLESS AMUSEMENTS WAS THE WIFE OF WILLIAM LORD SANDYS AND DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF SALISBURY
AND MAY NOT MY FRIENDSHIP HAVE DESERVED IT
AND THE WAY TO LESSEN THOSE WE FEEL AND TO SCAPE THOSE WE FEAR IS TO SUFFER PATIENTLY WHAT IS IMPOSED MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY
HERE IS A SEAL THAT WALKER SET FOR ME AND TIS DROPT OUT
WHY DID YOU GET SUCH A COLD
WOULD YOU THINK THAT UPON EXAMINATION IT IS FOUND THAT YOU ARE NOT AN INDIFFERENT PERSON TO ME
THEY CANNOT HINDER OUR BEING PERFECT FRIENDS
I LAY ABED ALL NEXT DAY TO RECOVER MYSELF AND RISED A THURSDAY TO RECEIVE YOUR LETTER WITH THE MORE CEREMONY
BUT THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM MY HUMOUR THAT TIS NOT POSSIBLE WE SHOULD EVER AGREE
AND NOW I SPEAK OF HER SHE IS ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR AUNT MY LADY B AND SAYS ALL THAT YOU SAY OF HER
THAT IF YOU DESIRED MY COMING OVER AND I COULD NOT BE CONTENT WITHOUT HE WOULD NOT HINDER ME THOUGH HE VERY MUCH DESIRED MY COMPANY A MONTH OR TWO LONGER AND THAT IN THAT TIME TWAS VERY LIKELY I MIGHT HAVE HIS AS WELL
ALL ENGLAND IS FILLED WITH INTENSE EXCITEMENT OVER CROMWELL'S COUP D'ETAT
IN EARNEST I HAD A LITTLE SCRUPLE WHEN I WENT WITH YOU THITHER AND BUT THAT I WAS ASSURED IT WAS TOO LATE TO GO ANY WHITHER ELSE AND BELIEVED IT BETTER TO HEAR AN ILL SERMON THAN NONE I THINK I SHOULD HAVE MISSED HIS BELLES REMARQUES
TO NEGOTIATE WITH GENERAL MONK
BUT DID NOT YOU TELL ME YOU SHOULD NOT STAY ABOVE A DAY OR TWO
TIS TOO GREAT A HAPPINESS AND I THAT KNOW MYSELF BEST MUST ACKNOWLEDGE I DESERVE CROSSES AND AFFLICTIONS BUT CAN NEVER MERIT SUCH A BLESSING
SHE WAS A FAVOURITE ATTENDANT OF QUEEN HENRIETTA AND THERE ARE EVIL RUMOURS CONNECTING HER NAME WITH THAT OF STRAFFORD
ONLY TWAS FOUND FAULT WITH THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR KISSING HIS WIFE BEFORE COMPANY A FOOLISH TRICK THAT YOUNG MARRIED MEN ARE APT TO
THEY WILL HAVE ME AT MY PART IN A PLAY THE LOST LADY IT IS AND I AM SHE
MY LORD BROGHILL SURE WILL GIVE US SOMETHING WORTH THE READING
I THAT REMEMBERED YOU WERE BY YOUR OWN APPOINTMENT TO BE IN ITALY AT THAT TIME ASKED THE MESSENGER WHERE HE HAD IT WHO TOLD ME MY LADY YOUR MOTHER SENT HIM WITH IT TO ME
HER ELDEST SISTER NOT ANNE AS WOTTON CONJECTURES MARRIED ONE SIR THOMAS PEYTON A KENTISH ROYALIST OF SOME NOTE
ITS SPRINGS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY LORD NORTH IN 1606
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF YOU SINCE YOU WERE MORE IGNORANT AND LESS CONCERNED IN MY BEING IN TOWN THAN HE
AND AFTER THE SPACE OF THREE WEEKS THE PARTIES WITH TWO WITNESSES MIGHT GO BEFORE A MAGISTRATE WHO HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF BY MEANS OF EXAMINING WITNESSES ON OATH OR OTHERWISE THAT ALL THE PRELIMINARIES COMMANDED BY THE ACT HAD BEEN PROPERLY FULFILLED FURTHER SUPERINTENDED THE PROCEEDINGS TO PERFECT THE SAID INTENDED MARRIAGE AS FOLLOWS:--THE MAN TAKING THE WOMAN BY THE HAND PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS I A.B DO HEREBY IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TAKE THEE C.D
YET WE ARE VERY GREAT FRIENDS AND FOR MY COMFORT SHE SAYS SHE WILL COME AGAIN ABOUT THE LATTER END OF JUNE AND STAY LONGER WITH ME
YOU CAN WRITE AND HEAR FROM THE FIRST AND I SHOULD NOT SEE YOU SOONER IF YOU CONTINUED STILL AT THE LAST
HE WAS MAKING A PURCHASE OF ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN THE COUNTY
BESIDES I CAN ASSURE YOU WE DO PERFECTLY AGREE IF YOU RECEIVE NOT SATISFACTION BUT FROM MY LETTERS I HAVE NONE BUT WHAT YOURS GIVE ME
BUT I'LL LEAVE THIS WHICH IS NOT MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AND TELL YOU HOW WITH MY USUAL IMPATIENCE I EXPECTED YOUR LETTER AND HOW COLD IT WENT TO MY HEART TO SEE IT SO SHORT A ONE
IF HE WERE TO MAKE TWENTY THEY SHOULD BE ALL SO HIS INVENTION CAN STRETCH NO FURTHER THAN BLUE AND RED
TWAS THE ONLY THING I EVER DESIRED WE MIGHT DIFFER IN AND THEREFORE I THINK IT IS DENIED ME
WHAT SAY YOU
MY BROTHER KEPT ME UP TO HEAR HIS LEARNED LECTURE TILL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK AND I SPENT ALL MY ILL-HUMOUR UPON HIM AND YET WE PARTED VERY QUIETLY AND LOOK'D AS IF A LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE MIGHT MAKE US GOOD FRIENDS
AT THIS TIME CROMWELL WAS HIS SUBORDINATE AND TO HIS DIRECTIONS LORD MANCHESTER'S SUCCESSES ARE IN ALL PROBABILITY DUE
OTHER NAMES WILL COME TO THE MIND OF EVERY READER BUT MANY OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WE KNOW BY NAME AS THE PHRASE RUNS MERE ACQUAINTANCES,--NOT FRIENDS
AND IF HE DID NOT LOVE HER I HAVE LESS TO EXPECT HE SHOULD ME
BUT HE WAS TOO MUCH SMITTEN WITH THIS LADY TO THINK OF MARRYING ANYBODY ELSE AND SERIOUSLY I COULD NOT BLAME HIM FOR SHE HAD AND HAS YET GREAT LOVELINESS IN HER
HE WAS A FELLOW OF ALL SOULS AND A BENCHER OF GRAY'S INN
TAKE FOR INSTANCE A POEM OF FOUR LINES FROM THE POEMS AND FANCIES ENTITLED THE JOINING OF SEVERAL FIGUR'D ATOMS MAKES OTHER FIGURES
I COULD NOT DENY THAT POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE SO BUT TWAS THAT I WAS SURE I COULD NEVER DO
HE DESIRES TO KNOW WHETHER I AM AT LIBERTY OR NOT
METHINKS HE THAT WRITES L'ILLUSTRE BASSA SAYS WELL IN HIS EPISTLE THAT WE ARE NOT TO IMAGINE HIS HERO TO BE LESS TAKING THAN THOSE OF OTHER ROMANCES BECAUSE THE LADIES DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT
LETTER 22._--MR FISH AND MR FREEMAN WERE PROBABLY NEIGHBOURS OF DOROTHY
AND DR GREY HIS LEARNED EDITOR BELIEVES THAT HE WROTE HUDIBRAS ABOUT THAT TIME BECAUSE HE HAD THEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERSE WITH THOSE LIVING CHARACTERS OF REBELLION NONSENSE AND HYPOCRISY WHICH HE SO LIVELY AND PATHETICALLY EXPOSES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORK SIR SAMUEL IS SAID HIMSELF TO BE THE ORIGINAL HUDIBRAS AND IF DR GREY'S CONJECTURE ON THIS MATTER IS A RIGHT ONE WE HAVE ALREADY IN OUR MINDS A VERY COMPLETE PORTRAIT OF DOROTHY'S NEIGHBOUR
WERE I IN MY OWN DISPOSAL YOU SHOULD COME TO MY GRAVE TO BE RESOLVED
WOULD YOU BE VERY GLAD TO SEE ME THERE AND COULD YOU DO IT IN LESS DISORDER AND WITH LESS SURPRISE THAN YOU DID AT CHICKSANDS
AND THE ELDEST IS A BARONET HAS A GOOD ESTATE A WIFE AND THREE OR FOUR CHILDREN
ALL THE REST IS BUT VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT AND I DURST PRONOUNCE IT SO FROM THAT LITTLE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE HAD OF THE WORLD THOUGH I HAD NOT SCRIPTURE FOR MY WARRANT
HERE THEN I DECLARE THAT YOU HAVE STILL THE SAME POWER IN MY HEART THAT I GAVE YOU AT OUR LAST PARTING
I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING OF MY FATHER'S BEING ILL OF LATE
I ADMIRE AT HER PATIENCE AND HER RESOLUTION THAT CAN LAUGH AT HIS FOOLERIES AND LOVE HIS FORTUNE
SHE HAS REASON TO LAUGH AT YOU WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE PERSUADED HER THE MOSS WAS SWEET I REMEMBER JANE BROUGHT SOME OF IT TO ME TO ASK ME IF I THOUGHT IT HAD NO ILL SMELL AND WHETHER SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT IT IN THE BOX OR NOT
YET SURE IT CONCERNS ME TO BE AT LEAST AS NICE AS HE IN POINT OF HONOUR
I USED TO RESPECT HIM MERELY AS HE WAS YOUR FATHER BUT I BEGIN NOW TO OWE IT TO HIMSELF
I AM TOO MUCH CONCERNED THAT YOU SHOULD LOVE ME EVER TO FORBID IT YOU
ELIZABETH DIED WITHOUT ISSUE IN 1772
YET I SHALL PERHAPS FIND BUSINESS ENOUGH TO CARRY ME UP TO TOWN
YET TIS A GRACIOUS PRINCE
OF THIS SORT YOU AND I ARE I THINK
I AGREE WITH YOU TOO THAT I DO NOT SEE ANY GREAT LIKELIHOOD OF THE CHANGE OF OUR FORTUNES AND THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO WISH THAN TO HOPE FOR
BUT FOR THE TEN POUND HE CLAIMS IT IS NOT YET DUE AND I THINK YOU MAY DO WELL TO PERSUADE HIM AS A FRIEND TO PUT IT IN THE NUMBER OF HIS DESPERATE DEBTS FOR TIS A VERY UNCERTAIN ONE
TIS A PLACE I LOOK UPON NOBODY IN
DID EVER ANYBODY FORGET THEMSELVES TO THAT DEGREE THAT WAS NOT MELANCHOLY IN EXTREMITY
OF HIS DUEL WITH MR STAFFORD THERE SEEMS TO BE NO ACCOUNT
THIS IF YOU CAN READ IT FOR TIS STRANGELY SCRIBBLED WILL BE ENOUGH TO ANSWER YOURS WHICH IS NOT VERY LONG THIS WEEK
DOROTHY OSBORNE WAS THE WIFE OF THE FAMOUS SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE AND APOLOGY FOR HER BIOGRAPHY WILL BE FOUND IN HER OWN LETTERS HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLISHED
BUT HIS LOVING HIS FIRST WIFE CAN BE NO ARGUMENT TO PERSUADE ME
TIS NOT POSSIBLE SHE SHOULD HAVE USED YOU WORSE THAN HE SAYS
TIS ALL THAT I PROPOSE OF HAPPINESS TO MYSELF IN THE WORLD
I DID NOT MEAN THAT HOWARD
BUT WHEN PEOPLE HAUNT ME WITH REASONING AND ENTREATIES WHEN THEY LOOK SADLY AND PRETEND KINDNESS WHEN THEY BEG UPON THAT SCORE TIS A STRANGE PAIN TO ME TO DENY
HE WAS FOR THE KING
I HAVE NOT SEEN A LETTER THIS MONTH WHICH HAS BEEN ABOVE HALF A SHEET
IF THERE WERE NOT CONVENIENCES OF SENDING I SHOULD PERSECUTE YOU STRANGELY
POETS OF ALL GRADES FROM WALLER DOWNWARDS HAVE SUNG OF HER BEAUTY VIVACITY AND WIT
I AM SURE I CANNOT READ IT MYSELF
SEALED WITH BLACK WAX AND DIRECTED FOR MR WILLIAM TEMPLE AT SIR JOHN TEMPLE'S HOME IN DAMASK STREET DUBLIN
SUCH AS ARE OLDEST AND ODDEST ARE MOST PRIZED AND IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY THAT IS LATELY COME OUT OF ITALY TIS TEN TO ONE BUT THEY HAVE A STORE FOR THEY ARE VERY COMMON THERE
AND IF MY BROTHER PEYTON HAD COME BEFORE HIS GOING I HAD SPOILED HER PREDICTION
WHICH WE DID SO PERFECTLY THAT WE MADE HIM CONTRADICT HIMSELF THE STRANGEST THAT EVER YOU SAW
BUT IF THESE BE SECURED NOTHING CAN ALTER THE RESOLUTION I HAVE TAKEN OF SETTLING MY WHOLE STOCK OF HAPPINESS UPON THE AFFECTION OF A PERSON THAT IS DEAR TO ME WHOSE KINDNESS I SHALL INFINITELY PREFER BEFORE ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION WHATSOEVER AND I SHALL NOT BLUSH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE MADE THE WHOLE WORLD BESIDE SO INDIFFERENT TO ME THAT IF I CANNOT BE YOURS THEY MAY DISPOSE OF ME HOW THEY PLEASE
I AM GLAD YOUR FATHER IS SO KIND TO YOU
NOTHING DISPLEASED NOTHING TROUBLED ME
YET I AM SURE MY INTENTIONS TOWARDS YOU ARE VERY INNOCENT AND GOOD FOR YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHOSE INTERESTS I SHALL EVER PREFER MUCH ABOVE MY OWN
HE TELLS US THAT THE POOR CAPTAIN CAPTAIN CROW OF THE MONMOUTH FOUND HIMSELF IN THE TOWER ABOUT IT BUT HE DOES NOT ADD ANY FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO THE PART WHICH DOROTHY PLAYED IN THE MATTER
IN A YEAR TOO WHEN MERE COLDS KILL AS MANY AS A PLAGUE USED TO DO
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I COULD SUFFER THAT THEY SHOULD SAY I MARRIED WHERE I HAD NO INCLINATION BECAUSE MY FRIENDS THOUGHT IT FIT RATHER THAN THAT I HAD RUN WILFULLY TO MY OWN RUIN IN PURSUIT OF A FOND PASSION OF MY OWN
A PROPOS DE JANE SHE BIDS ME TELL YOU THAT IF YOU LIKED YOUR MARMALADE OF QUINCE SHE WOULD SEND YOU MORE AND SHE THINKS BETTER THAT HAS BEEN MADE SINCE
THERE WILL COME A TIME FOR A LONG LETTER AGAIN BUT THERE WILL NEVER COME ANY WHEREIN I SHALL NOT BE YOURS
AND THAT IF EVER OUR FORTUNES WILL ALLOW US TO MARRY YOU SHALL DISPOSE OF ME AS YOU PLEASE
AND I HOPE THIS WILL FIND YOU AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END
THAT ALL THEIR MIRTH HAS NOT MENDED MY HUMOUR AND THAT I AM HERE THE SAME I WAS IN OTHER PLACES
THE WORLD HAD CEASED TO WONDER AT ENGLISH DEMOCRACY GIVING LAWS TO THEIR QUONDAM RULERS AND THE DEMOCRACY WAS BEGINNING TO BE A LITTLE TIRED OF ITSELF TO DISBELIEVE IN ITS OWN IRKSOME DISCIPLINE AND TO SIGH FOR THE FLESH-POTS OF A MODIFIED PRESBYTERIAN MONARCHY
NO REALLY HE DESERVES THAT ALL YOUR OCCASIONS SHOULD WAIT FOR HIS
I CAN PARDON ALL MY COUSIN FRANKLIN'S LITTLE PLOTS OF DISCOVERY IF SHE BELIEVED HERSELF WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS CONFIDENT OUR HUMOURS WOULD AGREE EXTREMELY WELL
AFTER SUPPER MY BROTHER AND I FELL INTO DISPUTE ABOUT RICHES AND THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF IT
I REMEMBER NOW THAT I WRIT ROBIN SPENCER INSTEAD OF WILL
I COULD FIND IN MY HEART TO STEAL HER AWAY MYSELF BUT IT SHOULD BE RATHER FOR HER PERSON THAN HER FORTUNE
OF THE SCANDAL CONCERNING LORD RICH I AM NOT SORRY TO KNOW NOTHING
FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SAID SO POSITIVELY AS IT SEEMS SHE DID THAT I SHOULD NOT BE IN TOWN TILL MY BROTHER CAME BACK
NOW I SHALL LOOK UPON'T AS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD NOT LOSE AND THEREFORE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP IT FOR YOU
ONLY I AM A LITTLE SCANDALIZED TO CONFESS THAT SHE USES THAT WORD FAITHFUL,--SHE THAT NEVER KNEW HOW TO BE SO IN HER LIFE
THIS COLD WEATHER KILLS HER I THINK IT HAS UNDONE ME I AM SURE IN KILLING AN OLD KNIGHT THAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SEVEN YEAR AND NOW HE DIES AND WILL LEAVE ME NOTHING I BELIEVE BUT LEAVES A RICH WIDOW FOR SOMEBODY
AGAIN IN FEBRUARY 1655 ONE MR PORTER FINDS HIMSELF COMMITTED TO LAMBETH HOUSE FOR CARRYING AWAY THE LADY ANNE BLUNT AND ENDEAVOURING TO MARRY HER WITHOUT HER FATHER'S CONSENT
THE PARLIAMENT SENDING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURATS OF GUERNSEY TO SEIZE THE PERSON OF SIR PETER
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHO THIS SHOULD BE THAT MR DR MEANT AND AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE TWAS A STORY MEANT TO DISTURB YOU THOUGH PERHAPS NOT BY HIM
BUT NOW IT CANNOT BE
TWOULD SERVE YOU TO LAUGH AT THIS SEVEN YEARS
WHY SHOULD YOU GIVE YOURSELF OVER SO UNREASONABLY TO IT
BUT I AM UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL BE AND THEREFORE IT WILL BE BEST THAT I SEND YOU WORD WHEN I AM THERE
FOR IN EARNEST THE ODDNESS ON'T PUT ME INTO THAT VIOLENT LAUGHING THAT I WAKED MYSELF WITH IT
SHE WAS THE THIRD WIFE OF ROBERT SUTTON EARL OF LEXINGTON
BUT YOU MUST NOT BE TROUBLED AT THIS
WHOMSOEVER IT IS THAT YOU EMPLOY HE WILL NEED NO OTHER INSTRUCTIONS BUT TO GET THE BIGGEST HE CAN MEET WITH
LILLY WHEN HE SET UP FOR HIMSELF WROTE MANY ASTROLOGICAL WORKS WHICH SEEM TO HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL
YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT I WOULD BE AT AND HOW I INTEND TO DISPOSE OF MYSELF
THE LESS ONE KNOWS OF STATE AFFAIRS I FIND IT IS THE BETTER
BUT FOR WHAT SHE TELL YOU OF MY MELANCHOLY YOU MUST NOT BELIEVE
I HAVE HEARD MANY PEOPLE WONDER HOW HE SPENDS HIS ESTATE
I WAS VERY SORRY FOR IT I REMEMBER FOR I LIKED SO FAR AS I HAD SEEN OF IT EXTREMELY
THEY THEN REMOVED TO IRELAND WHERE THEY LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS WITH TEMPLE'S FATHER
SHE FIRST MARRIED RICHARD EARL OF DORSET AND AFTERWARDS THE EARL OF PEMBROKE
WHEREAS IF WE ARE CROSSED IN THAT WHICH ONLY CAN MAKE THE WORLD PLEASING TO US WE ARE QUICKLY TIRED WITH THE LENGTH OF OUR JOURNEY AND THE DISQUIET OF OUR INNS AND LONG TO BE AT HOME
YOUR FELLOW-SERVANT HAS A BLESSED TIME ON'T THAT EVER YOU SAW
TIS A PLAIN HEAD BUT NOT ILL CUT I THINK
THE TRUTH IS I CANNOT DENY BUT THAT I HAVE BEEN VERY CARELESS OF MYSELF BUT ALAS
YOU MUST ALLOW HIM THE PRIVILEGE OF A TRAVELLER AND HE DOES NOT ABUSE IT
BUT SERIOUSLY NOW I WONDER AT YOUR PATIENCE
BUT NO
SIR,--I AM SO GREAT A LOVER OF MY BED MYSELF THAT I CAN EASILY APPREHEND THE TROUBLE OF RISING AT FOUR O'CLOCK THESE COLD MORNINGS
AND IF YOU HAVE NOT MUCH MORE THAN AN ORDINARY OBEDIENCE FOR HIM I SHALL NEVER BELIEVE YOU HAVE MORE THAN AN ORDINARY KINDNESS FOR ME
AS I MUST HAVE BEEN IF I HAD MARRIED THE EMPEROR
IT IS BUT A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES
UNLESS I HAD MORE ON'T MYSELF
I WOULD NOT HAVE THE WORLD BELIEVE I MARRIED OUT OF INTEREST AND TO PLEASE MY FRIENDS
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE STAYED IN AND NEAR LONDON UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1654 WHEN HE WENT TO IRELAND WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS THEN REINSTATED IN HIS OFFICE OF MASTER OF THE ROLLS
AND FIRST LET ME ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE SEEN A BOOK OF POEMS NEWLY COME OUT MADE BY MY LADY NEWCASTLE
NOR CAN I IN JUSTICE PUNISH YOU FOR A FAULT UNWILLINGLY COMMITTED
UNLESS YOU USE TO GIVE ME BETTER MEASURE I SHALL NOT BE IN CASE TO UNDERTAKE A JOURNEY TO ENGLAND
AND THE PASSAGE IN THE EPISTLE TO WHICH DOROTHY REFERS,--WE QUOTE IT FROM A TRANSLATION BY ONE HENRY COGAN 1652,--RUNS AS FOLLOWS
BUT IN THIS MATTER THE READER OF DOROTHY'S LETTERS WILL BE AS WELL ABLE TO JUDGE AS MYSELF
MY HEART HAS FAILED ME TWENTY TIMES SINCE YOU WENT AND HAD YOU BEEN WITHIN MY CALL I HAD BROUGHT YOU BACK AS OFTEN THOUGH I KNOW THIRTY MILES DISTANCE AND THREE HUNDRED ARE THE SAME THING
JANUARY 22ND 1653 SIR,--NOT TO CONFIRM YOU IN YOUR BELIEF IN DREAMS BUT TO AVOID YOUR REPROACHES I WILL TELL YOU A PLEASANT ONE OF MINE
WHAT THINK YOU MIGHT NOT I PREACH WITH MR MARSHALL FOR A WAGER
BUT WHAT SHOULD SHE DO WITH BEAUTY NOW
IT MAKES ME THINK OF THE FELLOW THAT COULD PAINT NOTHING BUT A FLOWER-DE-LUCE WHO WHEN HE MET WITH ONE THAT WAS SO FIRMLY RESOLVED TO HAVE A LION FOR HIS SIGN THAT THERE WAS NO PERSUADING HIM OUT ON'T WELL SAYS THE PAINTER LET IT BE A LION THEN BUT IT SHALL BE AS LIKE A FLOWER-DE-LUCE AS E'ER YOU SAW SO BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE IT A DOLPHIN HE CONSENTED TO IT BUT IT IS LIKE AN ILL-FAVOURED KNOT OF RIBBON
AND AT THIS PRESENT WE DO ABOUND WITH STORIES OF MY LADY SUNDERLAND AND MR SMITH
HERE IS A NEW SONG,--I DO NOT SEND IT TO YOU BUT TO YOUR SISTER
I AM THE MORE SENSIBLE OF YOUR TROUBLE BY MY OWN FOR I HAVE NEWLY GOT ONE MYSELF
IN VERY GOOD EARNEST NOW SHE IS A WOMAN BY ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD OF HER THAT ONE WOULD NOT LOSE
THE LADIES ARE ALL SO KIND THEY MAKE NO SPORT AND I MEET ONLY WITH ONE THAT TOOK ME BY DOING A HANDSOME THING OF THE KIND
WHERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
I DO NOT CARE FOR A DIVIDED HEART
SHE TOOK CARE EVERY NIGHT TO LAY A GREAT CUSHION UPON THE TABLE FOR HIM TO STRIKE ON THAT NOBODY MIGHT HEAR HIM AND SO DISCOVER HIS MADNESS
THE REST SHALL BE EMPLOYED IN TELLING YOU HOW SORRY I AM YOU HAVE GOT SUCH A COLD
DOROTHY MARRIED NICHOLAS BACON ESQ
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW CRUEL THEY ARE TO ME AND YET WILL PERSUADE ME TIS FOR MY GOOD
LET NAN LOOK TO THAT WITH WHOM I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE LEFT THE ORDERS OF CONVEYANCE
IN LONDON HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF ONE GILBERT WRIGHT AN INDEPENDENT CITIZEN OF SMALL MEANS AND SMALLER EDUCATION
AND NOW HE LOOKS MORE LIKE AN ASS THAN EVER HE DID
WHEN I COME TO MAKE SAD EXPERIMENTS ON IT IN MY OWN PERSON I SHALL KNOW MORE AND SAY LESS FOR FEAR OF DISHEARTENING OTHERS SINCE TIS NO ADVANTAGE TO FOREKNOW A MISFORTUNE THAT CANNOT BE AVOIDED AND FOR FEAR OF BEING PITIED WHICH OF ALL THINGS I HATE
IT SPOILED HIS BEAUTY SURE BEFORE I KNEW HIM FOR I COULD NEVER SEE IT OR ELSE WHICH IS AS LIKELY I DO NOT KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT
I'LL TELL YOU WHO HE URGED FOR AN EXAMPLE THOUGH MY LORD PEMBROKE AND MY LADY WHO THEY SAY ARE UPON PARTING AFTER ALL HIS PASSION FOR HER AND HIS MARRYING HER AGAINST THE CONSENT OF ALL HIS FRIENDS
I TELL HIM I BELIEVE SIR JOHN TUFTON COULD BE CONTENT I WERE SO TOO UPON THE SAME TERMS
IF I CAN KEEP HER TO MICHAELMAS I MAY PERHAPS BRING HER UP TO TOWN MYSELF AND TAKE THAT OCCASION OF SEEING YOU
CHRISTOPHER THOMAS RICHARD AND FRANCIS,--FRANCIS OSBORNE MAY BE MENTIONED AS HAVING TAKEN THE SIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT IN THE CIVIL WARS
BUT THEN I MUST FIND YOU PLEASED AND IN GOOD HUMOUR MERRY AS YOU WERE WONT TO BE WHEN WE FIRST MET IF YOU WILL NOT HAVE ME SHOW THAT I AM NOTHING AKIN TO MY COUSIN OSBORNE'S LADY
YOU WOULD BE MY NEIGHBOUR IF YOU HAD HER AND I SHOULD SEE YOU OFTEN
THIS AND THE LITTLE JOURNEYS YOU SAY YOU ARE TO MAKE WILL ENTERTAIN YOU TILL I COME
THEREFORE IF COLLINS BE MORE FOR YOUR EASE OR CONVENIENCY MAKE USE OF HIM HEREAFTER
IF IT BE SO YOU MUST NEEDS KNOW IT
WITH WHAT HARSH FATE DOES HEAVEN AFFLICT ME THAT ALL THE BLESSINGS WHICH MAKE OTHERS HAPPY MUST BE MY RUIN
HIS LINES ON LOVE THOUGH OVERCHARGED WITH QUAINT CONCEITS ARE OFTEN NOBLE AND TRUE AND END AT LEAST WITH ONE FINE COUPLET
IS IT IN EARNEST THAT YOU SAY YOUR BEING THERE KEEPS ME FROM THE TOWN
YET TIS ALL BUT THE SAYING WITH MORE CIRCUMSTANCE THAN I AM YOURS
HENRY AFTERWARDS KNIGHTED WAS PROBABLY THE JEALOUS BROTHER WHO LIVED AT CHICKSANDS WITH DOROTHY AND HER FATHER WITH WHOM SHE HAD MANY SKIRMISHES AND WHO WISHED IN HIS KIND FRATERNAL WAY TO SEE HIS SISTER WELL--THAT IS TO SAY WEALTHILY--MARRIED
IT WAS HE WHO SETTLED AT CHICKSANDS IN BEDFORDSHIRE AND PURCHASED THE NEIGHBOURING RECTORY AT HAWNES TO RESTORE IT TO THAT CHURCH OF WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE IN TRUTH MILITANT MEMBERS
CAN I DISCERN THAT IT HAS MADE THE TROUBLE OF YOUR LIFE AND CAST A CLOUD UPON MINE THAT WILL HELP TO COVER ME IN MY GRAVE
I CANNOT HELP IT AND YOU MUST TAKE IT AS PATIENTLY AS YOU CAN BUT I AM ENGAGED TO-NIGHT AT THE THREE RINGS TO SUP AND PLAY
BUT ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF GIVING ME A STRONG VANITY WITH TELLING ME I WRITE BETTER THAN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PERSON IN THE WORLD
FOR I HAVE TWENTY MORE I THINK TO WRITE AND THE HOPES I HAD OF RECEIVING ONE FROM YOU LAST NIGHT KEPT ME WRITING THIS WHEN I HAD MORE TIME
BUT NOW THAT THE REVISION OF THESE LETTERS IS APPARENTLY COMPLETE THE READER HAS SOME RIGHT TO EXPECT A FORMAL INTRODUCTION TO A LADY WHOSE NAME HE HAS IN ALL PROBABILITY NEVER HEARD
I AM NOT DISPLEASED THAT MY LORD LISLE MAKES NO MORE HASTE FOR THOUGH I AM VERY WILLING YOU SHOULD GO THE JOURNEY FOR MANY REASONS YET TWO OR THREE MONTHS HENCE SURE WILL BE SOON ENOUGH TO VISIT SO COLD A COUNTRY AND I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU ENDURE TWO WINTERS IN ONE YEAR
LETTER 34 SIR,--JANE WAS SO UNLUCKY AS TO COME OUT OF TOWN BEFORE YOUR RETURN BUT SHE TELLS ME SHE LEFT MY LETTER WITH NAN STACY FOR YOU
I WOULD CONFESS THAT I LOOKED UPON THE IMPUDENCE OF THIS FELLOW AS A PUNISHMENT UPON ME FOR MY OVER CARE IN AVOIDING THE TALK OF THE WORLD
THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN AT CHRISTMASTIDE 1653
I HAVE SENT INTO ITALY FOR SEALS
ON HIS ROAD TO FRANCE HE FELL IN WITH THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF SIR PETER OSBORNE
BUT I WILL NOT CHIDE IT MAY BE AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS YOU DO NOT KNOW ME SO WELL YET AS TO MAKE AN ABSOLUTE JUDGMENT OF ME
A MR MARSHALL WAS THE MAN THAT PREACHED BUT NEVER ANYBODY WAS SO DEFEATED
HE HAD PAINTED CHARLES I
MAY 18TH 1654
I WOULD FAIN MAKE EVEN WITH ALL THE WORLD AND BE OUT OF DANGER OF DYING IN ANYBODY'S DEBT
THEY SAY INDEED TIS A VERY FINE SEAT BUT IF I DID NOT MISTAKE SIR THOMAS CHEEKE HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NEVER A GOOD ROOM IN THE HOUSE
HE WAS A COUSIN OF DOROTHY
WE SHOULD ALL HAVE JOINED AGAINST HIM AS THE COMMON ENEMY FOR THOSE POOR YOUNG WENCHES ARE AS WEARY OF HIS GOVERNMENT AS I COULD HAVE BEEN
MY HEART TELLS ME SO AND I BELIEVE IT
ALL THIS IS PERFECT NONSENSE IN THEIR OPINION
FROM HAMMOND WHO WAS A ZEALOUS ADHERENT OF CHARLES I TEMPLE RECEIVED MUCH OF HIS EARLY EDUCATION
SHE HAD STUDIED NOT ONLY DIVINITY AND HISTORY BUT MATHEMATICS AND PHILOSOPHY
GIVE A ROUSE
I AM AFRAID SHE WILL NOT THINK ME A FIT PERSON TO CHOOSE FOR A FRIEND THAT CANNOT AGREE WITH MY OWN BROTHER
SIR,--YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I WAS SURPRIS'D TO FIND A LETTER THAT BEGAN DEAR BROTHER I THOUGHT SURE IT COULD NOT BELONG AT ALL TO ME AND WAS AFRAID I HAD LOST ONE BY IT
THOUGH IN A LETTER WRITTEN JUST AT THE TIME WHEN ALL ENGLAND WAS RINGING WITH THE NEWS OF THE VIOLENT DISSOLUTION OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM REMINDING TEMPLE WITH PARDONABLE VANITY HOW GREAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF SHE HAD BEEN SO WISE AS TO HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF THE OFFER OF H.C NOR WAS IT ONLY THE INFLUENCE OF RIVALS THAT TEMPLE HAD TO DREAD
HOWEVER I SHALL WISH HIM ALL GOOD SUCCESS IF HE BE YOUR FRIEND AS I SUPPOSE HE IS BY HIS CONFIDENCE IN YOU
I CAME DOWN HITHER NOT HALF SO WELL PLEASED AS I WENT UP WITH AN ENGAGEMENT UPON ME THAT I HAD LITTLE HOPE OF SHAKING OFF FOR I HAD MADE USE OF ALL THE LIBERTY MY FRIENDS WOULD ALLOW ME TO PRESERVE MY OWN AND TWOULD NOT DO
I MUST BE DECEIVED MYSELF BEFORE I CAN DECEIVE YOU AND I HAVE SO ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO TELL YOU ALL THAT I THINK THAT I MUST EITHER SAY NOTHING OR THAT WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE TRUE
YET I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT BUT TWAS IN A DREAM
I WILL NOT REPROACH YOU HOW ILL AN INTERPRETATION YOU MADE OF THIS BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE NO MORE QUARRELS
THERE IS A STORY OF ARTEMISE THAT I WILL RECOMMEND TO YOU
WILL MY COUSIN F
AND SINCE YOU ARE AT LEISURE TO CONSIDER THE MOON YOU MAY BE ENOUGH TO READ CLEOPATRE THEREFORE I HAVE SENT YOU THREE TOMES
TO YOU THAT KNOW MY HEART AND FROM WHOM I SHALL NEVER HIDE IT TO WHOM A THOUSAND TESTIMONIES OF MY KINDNESS CAN WITNESS THE REALITY OF IT AND WHOSE FRIENDSHIP IS NOT BUILT UPON COMMON GROUNDS I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY BUT THAT I IMPOSE NOT MY OPINIONS UPON YOU AND THAT I HAD RATHER YOU TOOK THEM UP AS YOUR OWN CHOICE THAN UPON MY ENTREATY
WHY DO I ENTER INTO THIS WRANGLING DISCOURSE
I CARRIED ONE THITHER SINCE MYSELF AND THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE WAS SO VERY ANGRY BECAUSE I DESIRED HER TO HAVE A CARE ON'T THAT I MADE THE COACHMAN DRIVE AWAY WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED LEST SHE SHOULD HAVE BEATEN ME
HE WAS ADMITTED GENTLEMAN COMMONER IN 1650 AND IT IS SAID MADE GREAT PROFICIENCY IN SEVERAL BRANCHES OF LEARNING BEING AS EXACT A LATIN AND GRECIAN AS ANY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF HIS AGE OR TIME HE SUCCEEDED TO HIS FATHER'S TITLE SOON AFTER COMING OF AGE AND TOOK A LEADING PART IN THE POLITICS OF THE DAY BECOMING KNIGHT OF THE SHIRE OF NORTHAMPTON IN THE RESTORATION PARLIAMENT
OF MILBOURNE ST ANDREW IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE
IN EARNEST I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT I MET WITH A CURE FOR IT
HER HUSBAND WAS SIR THOMAS VAVASOUR BART
I AM CONVINCED TOO HAPPINESS IS MUCH SUCH A KIND OF THING AS YOU DESCRIBE OR RATHER SUCH A NOTHING
IN YOUR NEXT I EXPECT SOME OTHER COMMENDATION ON'T OR ELSE I SHALL HARDLY MAKE SUCH HASTE TO IT AS PEOPLE HERE BELIEVE I WILL
BAGSHAWE IN AFTER LIFE JOINED THE KING AT OXFORD AND SUFFERED IMPRISONMENT AT THE HANDS OF HIS FORMER FRIENDS IN THE KING'S BENCH PRISON FROM 1644 TO 1646
I KNOW IT MAY BE ABUSED AS THE BEST THINGS ARE MOST SUBJECT TO BE BUT IN ITSELF TIS SO ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WHERE IT IS WANTING NOTHING CAN RECOMPENSE THE MISS ON'T
I MAKE IT A CASE OF CONSCIENCE TO DISCOVER MY FAULTS TO YOU AS FAST AS I KNOW THEM THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
I WAS SATISFIED MYSELF BUT COULD NOT TELL HOW TO PERSUADE ANOTHER OF THE TRUTH ON'T
IF IT BE NEITHER OF THE SPENCERS I WISH IT WERE
AND NOW I HAVE BEGUN TO TALK GRAVELY AND WISELY I'LL TRY IF I CAN GO A LITTLE FURTHER WITHOUT BEING OUT
DOROTHY HAD RETURNED FROM LONDON TO CHICKSANDS AND EITHER HAD NOT SEEN TEMPLE OR HE HAD LEFT LONDON HURRIEDLY WHILST SHE WAS THERE
AND FIRST FOR MY SHERIFF LET ME DESIRE YOU TO BELIEVE HE HAS MORE COURAGE THAN TO DIE UPON A DENIAL
AND THAT I WAS WILLING AS LONG AS I COULD TO AVOID SAYING ANYTHING WHEN I HAD NOTHING TO SAY WORTH YOUR KNOWING
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY MADE ME A LEG OR SPOKE CIVILLY TO ME I SHOULD BELIEVE THEY DID NOT THINK I DESERVED THEIR RESPECT
WHAT CAN EXCUSE ME IF I SHOULD ENTERTAIN ANY PERSON THAT IS KNOWN TO PRETEND TO ME WHEN I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF EVER MARRYING HIM
I'LL GIVE IT OVER AND TELL YOU THAT PARTHENISSA IS NOW MY COMPANY
AND BECAUSE SHE DID NOT I WAS RESOLV'D TO PUNISH HER AND KEPT HER UP TILL ONE O'CLOCK TELLING ME ALL HER STORIES
BUT THE MISCHIEF ON'T IS HE HAS NOT ABOVE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED POUND A YEAR THOUGH HE SWEARS HE BEGINS TO THINK ONE MIGHT BATE L500 A YEAR FOR SUCH A HUSBAND
IS IT TRUE THAT MY LORD WHITLOCKE GOES AMBASSADOR WHERE MY LORD LISLE SHOULD HAVE GONE
HER LAST LOVER'S LETTER IS WRITTEN
HOW FAIN I WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY BUT I KNOW NO MORE THAN YOU SAW IN THAT LETTER I SENT YOU
I CANNOT TALK ON'T AT THE RATE THAT YOU DO
BUT IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD NOT GIVE YOURSELF OVER TO THAT WHICH WILL INFALLIBLY KILL YOU IF IT CONTINUE
I REMEMBER MY MOTHER WHO IF IT MAY BE ALLOWED ME TO SAY IT WAS COUNTED AS WISE A WOMAN AS MOST IN ENGLAND,--WHEN SHE SEEMED TO DISTRUST ANYBODY AND SAW I TOOK NOTICE ON'T WOULD ASK IF I DID NOT THINK HER TOO JEALOUS AND A LITTLE ILL-NATURED
AND DO YOU BUT KEEP MY COUNSEL NOBODY SHALL EVER KNOW THAT I HAD IT
DOES SHE NOT NEED ALL HER FAITH IN HER LOVER IN HERSELF AY AND IN GOD TO UPHOLD HER IN THIS NEW AFFLICTION
BUT IN EARNEST THERE WAS ONE MORE TO BE PITIED BESIDES US AND THAT WAS COLONEL THORNHILL'S WIFE AS PRETTY A YOUNG WOMAN AS I HAVE SEEN
MY EYES GROW A LITTLE DIM THOUGH FOR ALL THE ALE AND I BELIEVE IF I COULD SEE IT THIS IS MOST STRANGELY SCRIBBLED
IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW OFTEN I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAD TOO MUCH FRANCHISE IN MY HUMOUR AND THAT TWAS A POINT OF GOOD BREEDING TO DISGUISE HANDSOMELY
THIS SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTS FOR THE LETTERS BEING IN THEIR PRESENT HANDS AND THESE STATED FACTS WILL I TRUST SET AT REST THE FEARS OR HOPES OF SCEPTICS
IN THE MEANTIME I KNOW NOT WHAT EXCUSES TO MAKE FOR THE TROUBLE I HAVE PUT YOU TO ALREADY OF WHICH I GROW TO BE ASHAMED
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE I AM SURE
BUT YOU MUST TELL ME THEN WHICH BRICKHILL IT IS YOU STOP AT LITTLE OR GREAT
TIS BUT A FIT OF AN AGUE HE HAS GOT THAT THE NEXT CHARM CURES YET HE WILL BE APT TO FALL INTO IT AGAIN UPON A NEW OCCASION AND ONE KNOWS NOT HOW IT MAY WORK UPON HIS THIN BODY IF IT COMES TOO OFTEN
DOROTHY WAS FOND OF DOGS OF LARGER AND MORE FORMIDABLE BREED THAN THOSE WHICH LIE ON MODERN HEARTHRUGS
BUT AS WE HAVE VERY SHORTLY TO COME TO A SERIES OF UNHAPPY LETTERS QUITE DISTINCT IN THEIR CHARACTER FROM THESE I HAVE THOUGHT FIT TO PLACE IN THIS LONG CHAPTER YET A FEW MORE LETTERS AFTER DOROTHY'S AUTUMN VISIT TO LONDON
IN HIS OBSTINATE FLESH AND BLOOD DEVOTION TO THE HOUSE OF STUART HE WAS AS SINCERE AND THOROUGH AS SIR HENRY LEE SIR GEOFFREY PEVERIL OR KENTISH SIR BYNG
AND IF HIS BROTHER HAVE NOT A BETTER GIFT IN COURTSHIP HE WILL OWE MY LADY'S FAVOUR TO HIS FORTUNE RATHER THAN TO HIS ADDRESS
YOU HAD REPENTED YOU I HOPE OF THAT AND ALL OTHER YOUR FAULTS BEFORE YOU THOUGHT OF DYING
IN SUCH STRAIN WRITES THE AUTHOR OF WHY SO PALE AND WAN FOND LOVER AND BOTH THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE DOGGEREL SHOULD BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO THE SNOBOLOGIST
BUT WHEN HE ASKS MY PARDON WITH TEARS PLEADS TO ME THE LONG AND CONSTANT FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US AND CALLS HEAVEN TO WITNESS THAT NOTHING UPON EARTH IS DEAR TO HIM IN COMPARISON OF ME THEN I CONFESS I FEEL A STRONGER UNQUIETNESS WITHIN ME AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO EVADE HIS IMPORTUNITY
I TREMBLE AT THE DESPERATE THINGS YOU SAY IN YOUR LETTER
BY MARRIAGE HE ACQUIRED HOLLAND HOUSE KENSINGTON WHICH AFTERWARDS PASSED BY PURCHASE INTO THE HANDS OF A VERY DIFFERENT LORD HOLLAND AND HAS BECOME FAMOUS AMONG THE HOUSES OF LONDON
BUT THEY MIGHT BE DECEIVED AND TIS NOT SO STRANGE AS THAT YOU SHOULD IMAGINE A COLDNESS AND AN INDIFFERENCE IN MY LETTERS WHEN I SO LITTLE MEANT IT
HER OWN STYLE IS VERY AGREEABLE
FROM THIS WE MAY TAKE IT HOWEVER THAT HE WAS BORN AT GORMANCHESTER IN CROMWELL'S COUNTY WAS EDUCATED AT EMMANUEL COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE AND THAT BEFORE HE CAME TO LONDON HIS CHIEF CURE OF SOULS WAS AT FINCHINGFIELD IN ESSEX
THERE IS A LONG CATALOGUE OF HER WORKS IN BALLARD'S MEMOIRS BUT ALL PUBLISHED AT A DATE SUBSEQUENT TO 1653
THAT IS AM I NO MORE IN YOURS
IF IT WERE EXPECTED THAT ONE SHOULD GIVE A REASON FOR THEIR PASSIONS WHAT COULD HE SAY FOR HIMSELF
TIS VERY LATE AND HAVING BEEN ABROAD ALL THIS DAY I KNEW NOT TILL E'EN NOW OF THIS MESSENGER
I THINK TIS BEST FOR ME TO END HERE LEST MY ANGER SHOULD MAKE ME LOSE THAT RESPECT I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FOR YOUR FATHER AND TWERE NOT AMISS I THINK THAT I DEVOTED IT ALL TOWARDS YOU FOR BEING SO IDLE AS TO RUN OUT OF YOUR BED TO CATCH SUCH A COLD
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE CENTURY HE HAD BEEN A PURITAN AMONG PURITANS AND IN THE OLD HALL OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE HAD DELIVERED TWO LECTURES TO SHOW THAT BISHOPS MAY NOT MEDDLE IN CIVIL AFFAIRS AND THAT A PARLIAMENT MAY BE HELD WITHOUT BISHOPS
YET IF IT CAN BE ANY EASE TO YOU TO MAKE ME MORE MISERABLE THAN I AM NEVER SPARE ME
I CANNOT SAY BUT THAT I HAVE WANTED JANE
I SENT YOU A PART OF CYRUS LAST WEEK WHERE YOU WILL MEET WITH ONE DORALISE IN THE STORY OF ABRADAH AND PANTHEE
I HAD IT FROM THIS HARROLD TWO HOURS BEFORE COLLINS CAME
CAN YOUR FATHER HAVE SO PERFECTLY FORGIVEN ALREADY THE INJURY I DID HIM SINCE YOU WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE ANY TO YOU IN HINDERING YOU OF MRS CHAMBERS AS TO REMEMBER ME WITH KINDNESS
THE COMMITTEE HAVING BEEN SENT INTO KENT TO PREVENT THE DISPERSAL OF RUMOURS TO THE SCANDAL OF PARLIAMENT,--NO LIGHT TASK ONE WOULD THINK
HE CANNOT BUT CONCLUDE MY BROTHER PEYTON WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING IN IT WITHOUT THE OTHERS CONSENT
SURE AS I LIVE IT IS NOT SETTLED YET
SHE WAS BORN IN 1620 AND AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN MARRIED HENRY LORD SPENCER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE BATTLE OF NEWBURY IN 1642
I SHALL NOT HAVE CALLED HER HIS MISTRESS NOW THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST THIS FORTNIGHT
THAT'S THE WAY TO KILL ME INDEED
YET THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT AND NO WOMAN SHALL EVER BE BLAMED THAT AN INCONSOLABLE PERSON PRETENDS TO HER WHEN SHE GIVES NO ALLOWANCE TO IT WHEREAS NONE SHALL SCAPE THAT OWNS A PASSION THOUGH IN RETURN OF A PERSON MUCH ABOVE HER
CHIDE ME WHEN I DO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT WELL BUT THEN MAKE HASTE TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME AND THAT YOU ARE WHAT I SHALL EVER BE A FAITHFUL FRIEND
NOBODY THAT HAS WILL E'ER DESIRE TO DO IT AGAIN FOR THEIR OWN SAKES AS WELL AS MINE
AND WE DEBATED IT SO LONG TILL WE HAD BOTH TALKED OURSELVES WEARY ENOUGH TO GO TO BED
POOR JAMES I HAVE BROKE HIS
I SHALL EXPECT A WHOLE PACKET NEXT WEEK
SO THAT UPON THE MATTER WE DIFFER VERY LITTLE
FOR GOD'S SAKE WHEN WE MEET LET US DESIGN ONE DAY TO REMEMBER OLD STORIES IN TO ASK ONE ANOTHER BY WHAT DEGREES OUR FRIENDSHIP GREW TO THIS HEIGHT TIS AT
I CAN ALLOW IT NOT TO BE ALTOGETHER WHAT SHE SAYS AND YET IT MAY BE VERY ILL TOO
I HAVE SENT YOU THE REST OF CLEOPATRE PRAY KEEP THEM ALL IN YOUR HANDS AND THE NEXT WEEK I WILL SEND YOU A LETTER AND DIRECTIONS WHERE YOU SHALL DELIVER THAT AND THE BOOKS FOR MY LADY
THE SPELLING HAS BEEN MODERNIZED THE LETTERS PUNCTUATED AND ARRANGED IN PARAGRAPHS AND NAMES INDICATED BY INITIALS HAVE BEEN WHEREVER IT WAS POSSIBLE WRITTEN IN FULL
113
AND THE GENTLEMAN THAT CAME UPSTAIRS IN A BASKET I COULD TELL HIM THAT HE SPENDS HIS BREATH TO VERY LITTLE PURPOSE AND HAS BUT HIS LABOUR FOR HIS PAINS
THESE ARE THE TERMS WE ARE AT AND I AM CONFIDENT HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD WITH ME SO THAT YOU HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR HIM IN ANY RESPECT
AN INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY LEGENDS AND GRADUAL GROWTH OF TUNBRIDGE WELLS IS TO BE FOUND IN A GUIDE-BOOK OF 1768 EDITED BY ONE MR J
FOR IF YOU ARE NOT I AM NOT ONLY IF I HAD BEEN SO WISE AS TO HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF THE OFFER WAS MADE ME BY HENRY CROMWELL I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A FAIR WAY OF PREFERMENT FOR SURE THEY WILL BE GREATER NOW THAN EVER
THE FEARS AND SURPRISES THE CROSSES AND DISORDERS OF THAT DAY TWAS CONFUSED ENOUGH TO BE A DREAM AND I AM APT TO THINK SOMETIMES IT WAS NO MORE
THE LATTER HAS WRITTEN SOME QUAINT AND ELEGANT VERSES TO HIS MISTRESS
PRAY LET ME KNOW WHETHER YOUR MAN LEAVES YOU AND HOW YOU STAND INCLINED TO HIM I OFFER YOU
TIME NOR ACCIDENTS SHALL NOT PREVAIL UPON OUR HEARTS AND IF GOD ALMIGHTY PLEASE TO BLESS US WE WILL MEET THE SAME WE ARE OR HAPPIER
IF SUCH THINGS COME IN YOUR WAY PRAY REMEMBER ME
IT MENTIONS MY LORD LISLE'S EMBASSAGE AGAIN
BUT A PROPOS OF MONSR
THE POEM WAS WRITTEN BY COWLEY WHEN A YOUNG MAN AT CAMBRIDGE
A COTTON-MILL STANDS ON THE RUINS OF MARLI
GOD KNOWS WHAT YOU HAVE AGREED ON TOGETHER
IF YOU DO NOT YOU WRONG A PERFECT FRIENDSHIP
SIR JOHN SUCKLING IN THE FOLLOWING DOGGEREL HAILS OUR NOBLE AUTHOR WITH A FLUNKEY'S ENTHUSIASM IT IS SO RARE AND NEW A THING TO SEE AUGHT THAT BELONGS TO YOUNG NOBILITY IN PRINT BUT THEIR OWN CLOTHES THAT WE MUST PRAISE YOU AS WE WOULD DO THOSE FIRST SHOW THE WAYS TO ARTS OR TO NEW WORLDS
YOU MUST PARDON ME IF I THINK THEY CANNOT BE WORTH IT
BUT HER STUDIES WERE NOT THOSE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH AND LADY JANE GREY
BUT SERIOUSLY THIS PLACE WILL NOT AFFORD MUCH TOWARDS THE ENLARGING OF A LETTER AND I AM GROWN SO DULL WITH LIVING IN'T FOR I AM NOT WILLING TO CONFESS YET I WAS ALWAYS SO AS TO NEED ALL HELPS
AND TRULY I SAW NO HARM IN'T FOR BY WHAT I HAD HEARD OF THE GENTLEMAN I GUESSED HE EXPECTED A BETTER FORTUNE THAN MINE
AND SINCE THIS WE ARE INSENSIBLY COME TO AS GOOD DEGREES OF CIVILITY FOR ONE ANOTHER AS CAN BE EXPECTED FROM PEOPLE THAT NEVER MEET
I WOULD NOT HAVE THE RULE SO ABSOLUTELY TRUE WITHOUT EXCEPTION THAT HARD HAIRS BE ILL-NATURED FOR THEN I SHOULD BE SO
LETTER 65._--OF WILLIAM LILLY A NOTED AND EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER OF THAT DAY THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT IS TAKEN FROM HIS OWN LIFE AND TIMES A LIVELY BOOK FULL OF AMUSING LIES AND ASTROLOGICAL GOSSIP IN WHICH THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A STUDENT OF THE BLACK ART
NOVEMBER 22._--AT NIGHT THE AMBASSADOR'S BROTHER AND THE REST RETURNED AGAIN AND WALKING THE UPPER EXCHANGE THEY MET WITH ONE COL
TIS AS YOU THINK
WHEN I CAME OUT OF FRANCE NOBODY KNEW ME AGAIN
AND WHEN HE TELLS YOU SO AGAIN ENGAGE WHAT YOU PLEASE UPON'T AND PUT IT UPON MY ACCOUNT
YOU WOULD WONDER TO SEE HOW TIRED SHE IS WITH HIS IMPERTINENCES AND YET HOW PLEASED TO THINK SHE SHALL HAVE A GREAT ESTATE WITH HIM
I MET WITH POLEXANDER AND L'ILLUSTRE BASSA BOTH SO DISGUISED THAT I WHO AM THEIR OLD ACQUAINTANCE HARDLY KNOW THEM
HOW MANY ACCIDENTS MAY HINDER US FROM EVER BEING HAPPY AND HOW FEW THERE ARE AND THOSE SO UNLIKELY TO MAKE UP OUR DESIRE
THE ALDERMAN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CITIZEN AS HE WAS CREATED BARONET IN 1660
SIR SAMUEL WAS NOT ONLY A COLONEL IN THE PARLIAMENT ARMY BUT SCOUT-MASTER-GENERAL IN THE COUNTIES OF BEDFORD AND SURREY
FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US NOT NEGLECT WHAT CAN ONLY MAKE US HAPPY FOR TRIFLES
THERE SEEMS LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE NOTICE TO PYM OF THE KING'S COMING TO THE HOUSE TO SEIZE THE FIVE MEMBERS
ADIEU
ADIEU
ADIEU
ADIEU
ADIEU
ADIEU
ADIEU
THEN I MAY SHOW YOU MY NIECE
LIEUTENANT'S PRINCIPLES
HE WAS A HIGH TORY AND A GREAT DEFENDER OF THE CHURCH AND ITS EJECTED MINISTERS ONE OF WHOM DR THOMAS MORTON THE LEARNED THEOLOGIAN BISHOP OF COVENTRY AND LICHFIELD DIED IN HIS HOUSE IN 1659
THESE AND THE RECORDS OF HIS LONDON PREACHING ARE THE ONLY FACTS IN HIS LIFE'S HISTORY WHICH HAVE COME TO MY NOTICE
BUT IT IS HARD IF ALL THE TESTIMONIES OF MY KINDNESS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY WITHOUT MY PUBLISHING TO THE WORLD THAT I CAN FORGET MY FRIENDS AND ALL MY INTEREST TO FOLLOW MY PASSION
WHEN I REMEMBER SHE IS TOM CHEEKE'S SISTER I AM APT TO THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIS NEWS AND MEANT TO TRY WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING OF TRUTH IN'T
SHE HAD A WONDERFUL QUICKNESS OF APPREHENSION AND AN AMAZING VIVACITY IN CONVERSATION
HE WAS ENTRUSTED BY CHARLES II
ONLY WITH YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE I THINK I SHOULD BE A LITTLE EXALTED WITH REMEMBERING THAT YOU HAD BEEN ONCE MY FRIEND
I AM SORRY FOR GENERAL MONK'S MISFORTUNES BECAUSE YOU SAY HE IS YOUR FRIEND
THE LAST I THANK GOD I HAVE IN PERFECTION
AFTER ALL THIS WHICH WOULD HAVE SATISFIED AN ORDINARY YOUNG MAN DID I THIS LAST THURSDAY RECEIVE A LETTER FROM HIM BY COLLINS WHICH HE SENT FIRST TO LONDON THAT IT MIGHT COME THENCE TO ME
LETTER 24._--TOM CHEEKE IS SIR THOMAS CHEEKE KNIGHT OF PURGO IN THE COUNTY OF ESSEX OR MORE PROBABLY HIS SON FROM THE WAY DOROTHY SPEAKS OF HIM
NEED I SAY THAT TIS BECAUSE I PREFER YOUR INTEREST MUCH BEFORE MY OWN BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU LOSE SO GOOD A DIVERSION AND SO PLEASING AN ENTERTAINMENT AS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THIS VOYAGE WILL BE TO YOU AND BECAUSE THE SOONER YOU GO THE SOONER I MAY HOPE FOR YOUR RETURN
AND YET IF YOU SAW WITH WHAT CAUTION I LIVE AT LEAST TO WHAT I DID BEFORE YOU WOULD REPROACH IT TO YOURSELF SOMETIMES AND MIGHT GRANT PERHAPS THAT YOU HAVE NOT GOT THE ADVANTAGE OF ME IN FRIENDSHIP SO MUCH AS YOU IMAGINE
I SHALL BE SENDING YOU ALL I HEAR
MY BROTHER HAS GONE TO WAIT UPON THE WIDOW HOMEWARDS,--SHE THAT WAS BORN TO PERSECUTE YOU AND I I THINK
I'LL MAKE YOUR STOMACH COME DOWN
IN 1684 ONE OF THESE CHILDREN THEIR ONLY DAUGHTER DIED OF SMALL-POX
MY CONCERN OR OF GREAT CONCERN IS IT SEEMS PROPERER THAN CONCERNMENT
YOU CANNOT APPREHEND THE FORMALITIES OF A TREATY MORE THAN I DO NOR SO MUCH THE SUCCESS ON'T
YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF READER IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
PEOPLE WILL THINK ME MAD IF I GO ABROAD THIS MORNING AFTER HAVING SEEN ME IN THE CONDITION I WAS IN LAST NIGHT AND THEY WILL THINK IT STRANGE TO SEE YOU HERE
OR IF THAT CANNOT BE LESS UNFORTUNATE AT LEAST THAN YOUR FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT D
SMITH WHAT A SCAPE HAS HE MADE OF MY LADY BARBURY
AND THOUGH SOME ARE WITHOUT IT YET TIS SO ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT NOBODY WANTING IT CAN BE WORTHY OF ANY ESTEEM
WAS THIS THE SPARK THAT LONELINESS AND ABSENCE FANNED INTO FLAME
IF I MAY UNDERTAKE TO COUNSEL I THINK YOU SHALL DO WELL TO COMPLY WITH YOUR FATHER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND NOT TO DISCOVER ANY AVERSION TO WHAT HE DESIRES FURTHER THAN YOU CAN GIVE REASON FOR
DECEMBER 24 1652 SIR,--YOU MAY PLEASE TO LET MY OLD SERVANT AS YOU CALL HIM KNOW THAT I CONFESS I OWE MUCH TO HIS MERITS AND THE MANY OBLIGATIONS HIS KINDNESS AND CIVILITIES HAS LAID UPON ME
I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER SAW OR HEARD OF ANY COUPLE THAT WERE BRED UP SO TOGETHER AS MANY YOU KNOW ARE THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR ONE ANOTHER FROM CHILDREN BUT THEY ALWAYS DISLIKED ONE ANOTHER EXTREMELY
BUT AT LAST MY BROTHER'S MATCH WITH MRS HARESON BEING UNHANDSOMELY ON HER SIDE BROKEN OFF WHEN THEY WERE SO NEAR BEING MARRIED AS THE WEDDING CLOTHES WERE TO BE MADE AND SHE AFTER MARRIED MR THOMAS HOWARD TO MY FATHER'S GREAT SATISFACTION WHO ALWAYS WAS AVERSE TO IT THOUGH TO COMPLY WITH MY BROTHER'S PASSION HE CONSENTED TO IT THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE DUEL IN A LETTER OF LORD CORK WHICH FIXES THE DATE AS 1639-40 BUT MR NEVILE'S NAME IS NOWHERE MENTIONED
THUS HE RECOMMENDS THEIR STUDY AND WE MAY APPLY HIS WORDS TO THE LETTERS BEFORE US
AND BE IT SO ONLY YOU MUST PARDON ME IF I CANNOT AGREE TO GIVE YOU FALSE HOPES
YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD YOUR CHOICE AND TRUST ME THEY SAY SOME OF THEM ARE HANDSOME
TIS NOT THAT I EXPECT BY ALL YOUR FATHER'S OFFERS TO BRING MY FRIENDS TO APPROVE IT
YOU MIGHT FIND TWENTY BETTER EMPLOYMENTS FOR'T
KING CHARLES AND WHO'LL DO HIM RIGHT NOW
MY LORD WHITELOCKE DID GO TO SWEDEN AS DOROTHY SURMISES
HAVE WE NOT HERE SOME LOCAL SQUIRES HIT OFF TO THE LIFE
SHE HAS LOST BY IT MUCH OF THE REPUTE SHE HAD GAINED BY KEEPING HERSELF A WIDOW
TIS WELL THE SIDE ENDED HERE
BUT SINCE IT IS LAID UPON ME BY THE HAND OF AN ALMIGHTY AND GRACIOUS GOD THAT ALWAYS PROPORTIONS HIS PUNISHMENTS TO THE SUPPORT HE GIVES WITH THEM I MAY HOPE TO BEAR IT AS A CHRISTIAN OUGHT TO DO AND MORE ESPECIALLY ONE THAT IS CONSCIOUS TO HERSELF OF HAVING MANY WAYS DESERVED IT
I HAVE A SCURVY HEAD THAT WILL NOT LET ME WRITE LONGER
I AM YOURS
I AM YOURS
I AM YOURS
I AM YOURS
I AM YOURS
DON'T LAUGH AT ME FOR COMMENDING MYSELF YOU WILL NEVER DO IT FOR ME AND SO I AM FORCED TO IT
JANE KISSES YOUR HANDS AND SAYS SHE WILL BE READY IN ALL PLACES TO DO YOU SERVICE
IF HE HAD LOVED HER TRULY HE WOULD HAVE DIED RATHER THAN HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION OF THIS MISFORTUNE TO HER
YET MY RECOVERY WILL BE NOTHING TOWARDS MY LEAVING THIS PLACE WHERE MANY REASONS WILL OBLIGE ME TO STAY AT LEAST ALL THIS SUMMER UNLESS SOME GREAT ALTERATION SHOULD HAPPEN IN THIS FAMILY
I WISH HIM ALL HAPPINESS AND ABLER SERVANTS THAN JOHN TEMPLE THE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS WRITTEN ON THAT OCCASION BY LADY TEMPLE TO HER NEPHEW SIR JOHN OSBORNE
THE FATHER OF THE HEROINE WAS COMMANDING IN GUERNSEY FOR KING CHARLES
CERTAINLY THAT JONES KNOWS MY NAME I BESPOKE A SADDLE OF HIM ONCE AND THOUGH IT BE A GOOD WHILE AGONE YET I WAS SO OFTEN WITH HIM ABOUT IT,--HAVING MUCH ADO TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND HOW I WOULD HAVE IT IT BEING OF A FASHION HE HAD NEVER SEEN THOUGH SURE IT BE COMMON,--THAT I AM CONFIDENT HE HAS NOT FORGOT ME
THERE IS VERY GREAT PEACE AND IMMUNITY FROM SIN IN RESIGNING OUR WILLS UP TO THE COMMAND OF OTHERS
TIS BUT AN AGUE THAT HE HAS BUT YET I AM MUCH AFRAID THAT IS MORE THAN HIS AGE AND WEAKNESS WILL BE ABLE TO BEAR
HE CANNOT BE SO UNJUST AS TO LET ME LOSE HIM SURE I WAS KIND TO HIM THOUGH I HAD SOME REASON NOT TO TAKE IT VERY WELL WHEN HE MADE THAT A SECRET TO ME WHICH WAS KNOWN TO SO MANY THAT DID NOT KNOW HIM
BUT I THANK GOD I HATE NOTHING ELSE BUT THE BASE WORLD AND THE VICES THAT MAKE A PART OF IT
BUT YOU WILL PARDON IT--WE ARE PAST CEREMONY AND EXCUSE ME IF I SAY NO MORE NOW BUT THAT I AM TOUJOURS LE MESME THAT IS EVER YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND SERVANT
YET I THINK TO BE IN LONDON IN THE NEXT TERM AND AM SURE I SHALL DESIRE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE
SOMETIMES I TELL THEM I WILL NOT MARRY AND THEN THEY LAUGH AT ME
I VOW TO YOU I MADE NOTHING ON'T WHEN SIR EMPEROR SAID SO BECAUSE I HAD NO GREAT OPINION OF HIS JUDGMENT BUT MR FREEMAN MAKES ME MISTRUST MYSELF EXTREMELY NOT THAT I AM SORRY I DID APPEAR SO TO HIM SINCE IT KEPT ME FROM THE DISPLEASURE OF REFUSING AN OFFER WHICH I DO NOT PERHAPS DESERVE BUT THAT IT IS A SCURVY QUALITY IN ITSELF AND I AM AFRAID I HAVE IT IN GREAT MEASURE IF I SHOWED ANY OF IT TO HIM FOR WHOM I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT AND ESTEEM
PRAY WHAT THE PAPER DENIED ME IN YOUR LAST LET ME RECEIVE BY HIM
SIR PETER HELD GUERNSEY FOR THE KING AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE LIKE THEIR FATHER WARM FOR THE ROYAL CAUSE
BUT MARRYING AND HANGING GO BY DESTINY THEY SAY
AND IF HE MISS THIS LONG THENCE TWOULD TROUBLE HIS JEALOUS HEAD
THE NAME OF LOVE IS GROWN SO CONTEMPTIBLE BY THE FOLLY OF SUCH AS HAVE FALSELY PRETENDED TO IT AND SO MANY GIDDY PEOPLE HAVE MARRIED UPON THAT SCORE AND REPENTED SO SHAMEFULLY AFTERWARDS THAT NOBODY CAN DO ANYTHING THAT TENDS TOWARDS IT WITHOUT BEING ESTEEMED A RIDICULOUS PERSON
THAT I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR SIR JOHN MERELY AS HE IS YOUR FATHER AND THAT TIS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS KINDNESS TO YOU
AND NOW WE HAVE FINISHED
WHICH THOUGH IT CANNOT BE MUCH LIVING AS I DO YET IT MAY BE MORE THAN VENTURES INTO IRELAND
AS SOON AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE CHURCH THEY TOOK COACH AND CAME FOR THE TOWN DINED AT AN INN BY THE WAY AND AT NIGHT CAME INTO LODGINGS THAT WERE PROVIDED FOR THEM WHERE NOBODY KNEW THEM AND WHERE THEY PASSED FOR MARRIED PEOPLE OF SEVEN YEARS STANDING
WE GREW TO A CALM AND PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD
IN EARNEST I THINK THEY DO
BUT WERE IT CERTAIN THAT THEY WENT TOGETHER ALWAYS I DARE SWEAR THERE IS NOBODY SO PROUD OF THEIR WIT AS TO KEEP IT UPON SUCH TERMS BUT WOULD BE GLAD AFTER THEY HAD ENDURED IT A WHILE TO LET THEM BOTH GO AS THEY CAME
BUT I THOUGHT NEVER TO HAVE DONE GIVING YOU THANKS FOR THEM
AND YOU ARE NOT TO THANK ME FOR IT SINCE TO SPEAK TRUTH I SECURE MY OWN BY IT
HER EYES HAVE NOT THE FLAMES THEY HAVE HAD NOR IS SHE LIKE I AM AFRAID TO RECOVER THEM HERE
THE NIGHT BEFORE I RECEIVED YOUR FIRST LETTER I DREAMT ONE BROUGHT ME A PACKET AND TOLD ME IT WAS FROM YOU
HIS SECOND WIFE WAS FRANCES DAUGHTER OF ROBERT EARL OF ESSEX AND SISTER TO THE GREAT GENERAL OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY
I THAT KNEW HOW MUCH I WANTED IT THOUGHT THIS THE SAFEST PLACE FOR ME TO ENGAGE IN AND WAS MIGHTILY PLEASED TO THINK I HAD MET WITH ONE AT LAST THAT HAD WIT ENOUGH FOR HIMSELF AND ME TOO
WELL THERE WAS NEVER ANY ONE THING SO MUCH DESIRED AND APPREHENDED AT THE SAME TIME AS YOUR RETURN IS BY ME
I AM TOLD TWILL DO ME GOOD AND AM CONTENT TO BELIEVE IT
I HAVE MISSED A LETTER THIS MONDAY
SUCH OF HIS SERMONS AS ARE STILL EXTANT ARE PROSY LONG-WINDED DOGMATIC ABSURDITIES OVERLOADED WITH PERIPHRASTIC ILLUSTRATIONS IN SCRIPTURAL LANGUAGE
I DID NOT THINK OF DRAWING ANY BUT MRS GOLDSMITH AND JANE WOULD NEED MAKE ME SOME FOR THEM AND MYSELF
SIX ATTIC WINDOWS JUT OUT FROM THE LOW-TILED ROOF
THOSE THAT I RECKONED UP WERE ONLY SUCH AS I COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO HAVE UPON NO TERMS THOUGH I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A PERSON IN MY LIFE AS MR TEMPLE
BY ONE OF THOSE CURIOUS FATEFUL COINCIDENCES WITH WHICH FACT OFTEN OUTBIDS FICTION MR GERARD WHO WAS THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN ATTACKED BY THE PORTUGUESE SUFFERS ON THE SAME SCAFFOLD AS HIS WOULD-BE MURDERERS HIS OFFENCE BEING HIGH TREASON
THIS WE HAD OVER SOME FORTY TIMES WHICH MADE ME REMEMBER IT WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT
FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1654 THE QUARREL IS OVER HAPPILY OVER AND DOROTHY AND TEMPLE ARE MORE THAN RECONCILED AGAIN
I AM COMING INTO MY PREACHING VEIN AGAIN
LETTER 40._--A LETTER HAS BEEN LOST
TWILL BE NO COMPLIMENT AFTER THIS TO SAY I LIKE YOUR LETTERS IN THEMSELVES
YOU MUST NEEDS SEE THE FOLLY ON'T YOURSELF AND THEREFORE EXAMINE YOUR OWN HEART WHAT TIS FIT FOR ME TO DO AND WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR A PERSON YOU LOVE AND THAT DESERVES YOUR COMPASSION IF NOTHING ELSE,--A PERSON THAT WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN INVIOLABLE FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU A FRIENDSHIP THAT SHALL TAKE UP ALL THE ROOM MY PASSION HELD IN MY HEART AND GOVERN THERE AS MASTER TILL DEATH COME AND TAKE POSSESSION AND TURN IT OUT
THIS SEEMS TO BE A RHYMING STATEMENT OF THE ATOMIC THEORY BUT WHETHER IT IS A POEM OR A FANCY WE SHOULD FIND IT HARD TO DECIDE
SIR PETER WAS AN ARDENT LOYALIST
WHAT CAN IT BE ELSE TO BE LOST TO ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD BUT THAT SINGLE OBJECT THAT TAKES UP ONE'S FANCY TO LOSE ALL THE QUIET AND REPOSE OF ONE'S LIFE IN HUNTING AFTER IT WHEN THERE IS SO LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF EVER GAINING IT AND SO MANY MORE PROBABLE ACCIDENTS THAT WILL INFALLIBLY MAKE US MISS ON'T
I THINK SO TOO AND AM NOT SORRY FOR IT
WHY SHOULD YOU MAKE AN IMPOSSIBILITY WHERE THERE IS NONE
THERE ARE TWO SCANDALS CONNECTED WITH HER NAME
YET YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED YOU SAY THAT TO BE MISERABLE IS THE WAY TO BE GOOD
FOR AS TO THE THING ITSELF WHETHER HE APPEARS IN'T OR NOT TWILL BE THE SAME
IN EARNEST I'M TROUBLED THAT YOU SHOULD BE PUT TO IT AND HAVE CHID THE CARRIER FOR COMING OUT SO SOON
IF I SAID NOTHING OF MY COMING TO TOWN TWAS BECAUSE I HAD NOTHING TO SAY THAT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
I READ IT SO COLDLY AND WAS SO TROUBLED TO FIND THAT YOU WERE SO FORWARD ON YOUR JOURNEY
THIS CEREMONY AND THIS ONLY WAS TO BE A LEGAL MARRIAGE
ALL THE WORLD IS SO ALMOST
LETTER 45 SIR,--'TIS MOST TRUE WHAT YOU SAY THAT FEW HAVE WHAT THEY MERIT
MONSIEUR GORE AND I AGREE MIGHTY WELL AND HE MAKES ME BELIEVE I SHALL COME TO SOMETHING AT LAST
I HAVE THE CABINET AND TIS IN EARNEST A PRETTY ONE
SEND ME A TORTOISE ONE THAT IS A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT I SENT FOR A PATTERN
THAT IS NOT MUCH MANY PEOPLE DO SO
HE WAS TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WHEN HE DIED
IF YOU HAVE YOU ARE SO TIRED THAT TIS BUT REASONABLE I SHOULD SPARE YOU IN THIS
I TOLD HIM HE WAS GONE ONE DAY BEFORE THE LETTER CAME
I TAKE IT VERY KINDLY THAT YOU PROMISE TO USE ALL YOUR INTEREST IN YOUR FATHER TO PERSUADE HIM TO ENDEAVOUR OUR HAPPINESS AND HE APPEARS SO CONFIDENT OF HIS POWER THAT IT GIVES ME GREAT HOPES
WE ARE READY FOR THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND LISTEN FOR THE WEDDING MARCH AND HAPPY JINGLE OF VILLAGE BELLS
AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER;--DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
KEEP THIS LETTER TILL IT BE CALLED FOR LETTER 3 JANUARY 2ND 1653 SIR,--IF THERE WERE ANYTHING IN MY LETTER THAT PLEASED YOU I AM EXTREMELY GLAD ON'T TWAS ALL DUE TO YOU AND MADE IT BUT AN EQUAL RETURN FOR THE SATISFACTION YOURS GAVE ME
JUSTICE I AM SURE WILL OBLIGE YOU TO IT SINCE YOU HAVE NO OTHER MEANS LEFT IN THE WORLD OF REWARDING SUCH A PASSION AS MINE WHICH SURE IS OF A MUCH RICHER VALUE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BESIDES
THE WIDOW WRITES ME WORD TOO THAT I MUST EXPECT HER HERE ABOUT A MONTH HENCE
PRAZIMENE AND POLEXANDER ARE TWO ROMANCES TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH,--THE FORMER A NEAT LITTLE DUODECIMO
HE WAS MY SERVANT HERETOFORE AND COMES TO SEE ME STILL FOR OLD LOVE'S SAKE
AS LONG AS YOUR LAST WAS I READ IT OVER THRICE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR THOUGH TO SAY TRUTH I HAD SKIPPED SOME ON'T THE LAST TIME
LETTER 35._--THIS IS WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF A LETTER OF SIR THOMAS PEYTON TO DOROTHY AND IS PROBABLY A POSTSCRIPT TO LETTER 34
NO CARICATURIST EVER REPRESENTED MR PITT AS A FALSTAFF OR MR FOX AS A SKELETON
IT WENT COLD TO MY HEART AS ICE AND HARDLY LEFT ME COURAGE ENOUGH TO ASK HIM THE QUESTION
BUT MY LORD RICH WAS NOT CAUGHT THO HE WAS NEAR IT
I MEANT TO CHIDE AND I THINK THIS IS NOTHING TOWARDS IT
IF THERE HAD BEEN AS GREAT A ONE IN MY FACE IT COULD BE EITHER VERY HANDSOME OR VERY UGLY
AND TO ALL THIS MUST BE ADDED THAT HE MUST LOVE ME AND I HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE CAPABLE OF LOVING
I WILL TAKE ORDER THAT MY LETTERS SHALL BE LEFT WITH JONES AND YOURS CALLED FOR THERE
HAD I NOT HEARD FROM YOU BY THIS LAST IN EARNEST I HAD RESOLVED TO HAVE GONE WITH THIS AND GIVEN MY FATHER THE SLIP FOR ALL HIS CAUTION
A QUIET PLACE,--"SLOW IS THE ACCURATE MODERN EPITHET FOR IT--"AWFULLY SLOW BUT TO DOROTHY A QUITE SUITABLE HOME AT WHICH SHE NEVER REPINES
LET US LOOK HERE
WHAT HAS IT BROUGHT MY POOR LADY ANNE BLUNT TO
MR HOWARD PRESENTED HIS MISTRESS BUT A DOZEN SUCH SEALS AS ARE NOT TO BE VALUED AS TIMES NOW GO
I HAVE READ YOUR REINE MARGUERITE AND WILL RETURN IT YOU WHEN YOU PLEASE
I HAVE BEEN FAULTY IN THAT POINT HERETOFORE I CONFESS BUT TIS A GOOD WHILE SINCE I GAVE IT OVER WITH MY READING O NIGHTS
SHE OUTLIVED BOTH HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE TO CARRY ON A WARLIKE ENCOUNTER WITH HER BROTHER'S AMANUENSIS MR JONATHAN SWIFT OVER TEMPLE'S LITERARY REMAINS
I BLEST MYSELF AT HER PATIENCE AS YOU MAY DO THAT I COULD FIND ANYTHING TO FILL UP THIS PAPER WITHAL
BUT I AM NOT DISPLEASED YOU SHOULD DESIRE MY KINDNESS ENOUGH TO APPREHEND THE LOSS OF IT WHEN IT IS SAFEST
I DID WRITE IT AND GAVE IT HARROLD BUT BY AN ACCIDENT HIS HORSE FELL LAME SO THAT HE COULD NOT SET OUT ON MONDAY
HERE THEN I'LL TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT ANGRY FOR ALL THIS
THAT RELIGION AND HONOUR WERE THINGS YOU DID NOT CONSIDER AT ALL AND THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT YOU WOULD TAKE ANY ENGAGEMENT SERVE IN EMPLOYMENT OR DO ANYTHING TO ADVANCE YOURSELF
DIRECTED FOR MR TEMPLE
AND WHY I WAS NOT TO KNOW YOU WENT SO FAR
IF HE OFFERS ME TO STAY HERE THIS HOLE WILL BE MORE AGREEABLE TO MY HUMOUR THAN ANY PLACE THAT IS MORE IN THE WORLD
HE WAS IN THE CONFIDENCE OF ROBERT SIDNEY EARL OF LEICESTER THE LORD-LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND
BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE LAST AND SAW DUBLIN AT THE DATE I COULD SCARCE BELIEVE MY EYES
BUT I MUST MAKE IT MY BARGAIN THAT IF I COME YOU WILL NOT BE FRIGHTED TO SEE ME
I PUT UP THE LETTER IN MY POCKET AND MADE WHAT HASTE I COULD TO LOSE THE MONEY I HAD LEFT THAT I MIGHT TAKE OCCASION TO GO FETCH SOME MORE
I KNOW NOT WHETHER HE GOES ON WITH IT
I FIND I AM TO BE BAITED BY THEM ALL BY TURNS
BUT PERHAPS IT WORKED IN HER LITTLE BRAIN
BUT THE NOTES THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY HISTORY OR EXPLANATION ARE SO FULL OF INTEREST SO FRESH AND VIVACIOUS EVEN FOR DOROTHY THAT THEY PLACE THEMSELVES FROM THE FREEDOM AND JOY OF THEIR STYLE AND MANNER AT THE END OF THE THIRD VOLUME
LETTER 53._--DOROTHY'S BROTHER SEEMS TO HAVE GOT HOLD OF A NEW WEAPON OF ATTACK IN TEMPLE'S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS WHICH MIGHT HAVE LED TO A STRATEGIC SUCCESS IN MORE SKILFUL HANDS
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO THINK SO AND NONE THAT YOU CAN TAKE ILL
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT ALGERNON SYDNEY BUT THAT I CANNOT SEE IN HIM THAT LIKELIHOOD OF A FORTUNE WHICH YOU SEEM TO IMPLY BY SAYING TIS NOT PRESENT
YOU WERE AS I THOUGHT PERFECTLY PLEASED WITH YOUR CONDITION
MY BROTHER SENT IT DOWN AND I HAVE ALMOST READ IT
NOW I HAVE GOT THE TRICK OF BREAKING MY WORD I SHALL DO IT EVERY DAY
AND SO SHOOTING OFF A PISTOL WHICH WAS AS THE WATCHWORD THE REST OF THE PORTUGALS SUPPOSED ABOUT FIFTY CAME IN WITH DRAWN SWORDS AND LEAVING A SUFFICIENT NUMBER TO KEEP THE STAIRS THE REST WENT UP WITH THE AMBASSADOR'S BROTHER AND THERE THEY FELL UPON COL
SHE HAS AN EXCELLENT FANCY SURE AND A GREAT WIT
IT CONTAINED PROVISIONS FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO INTENDED BEING JOINED TOGETHER IN HOLY MATRIMONY TO BE POSTED WITH CERTAIN OTHER PARTICULARS UPON THE DOOR OF THE COMMON MEETING-HOUSE COMMONLY CALLED THE PARISH CHURCH OR CHAPEL
HERE HE LEARNED LATIN AND GREEK AND BEGAN TO STUDY HEBREW
THOUGH TO SPEAK TRUTH IF I SHOULD MAKE THIS SO YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE IT THIS WEEK FOR TIS A GOOD WHILE SINCE TWAS CALL'D FOR
I'LL SWEAR YOU WANTED ONE WHEN YOU TOOK HER AND HAD VERY ILL FORTUNE THAT NOBODY MET YOU BEFORE HER
IN BOTH WHICH REGARDS I HAVE A GREAT HONOUR TO BE ESTEEMED MY GOOD SISTER YOUR FAITHFUL BROTHER AND SERVANT THOMAS PEYTON
I SHOULD THINK MYSELF SO IF I FOUND YOU GREW INDIFFERENT TO ME THAT I HAVE HAD SO LONG AND SO PARTICULAR A FRIENDSHIP FOR
I WAS HIS CONFIDANTE AND HEARD HIM MAKE HIS ADDRESSES
HE GIVES ME SOME TROUBLE WITH HIS SUSPICIONS
ESTHER JOHNSON THE UNFORTUNATE STELLA WAS LADY GIFFARD'S MAID
FOR THEY THINK IT A PIECE OF FRUGALITY BENEATH THEM TO BARGAIN OR ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THEY EAT IN ANY PLACE HOWEVER UNREASONABLY IMPOSED UPON DOROTHY IS QUITE RIGHT IN HER CORRECTION CONCERNING WILL SPENCER
HE ONLY MANAGES TO EXASPERATE DOROTHY WITH HIMSELF NOT WITH TEMPLE
THE JUDGMENT YOU HAVE MADE OF THE FOUR LOVERS I RECOMMENDED TO YOU DOES SO PERFECTLY AGREE WITH WHAT I THINK OF THEM THAT I HOPE IT WILL NOT ALTER WHEN YOU HAVE READ THEIR STORIES
AND THE PRINCE ARTIBIE WAS MUCH TO BLAME THAT HE OUTLIVED HIS BELLE LEONTINE
BUT I QUICKLY RECOVERED MYSELF WITH THINKING THAT YOU DESERVED TO BE CHID FOR GOING WHERE YOU KNEW YOU MUST OF NECESSITY LOSE YOUR TIME
BUT BECAUSE YOU TELL ME I SHALL NOT WANT COMPANY THEN YOU MAY DISPOSE OF THIS PIECE OF POETRY AS YOU PLEASE WHEN YOU HAVE SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRED WITH ME WHERE HE FOUND IT OUT FOR TIS MUCH OLDER THAN THAT OF MY LORD OF LORNE YOU ARE ALTOGETHER IN THE RIGHT THAT MY BROTHER WILL NEVER BE AT QUIET TILL HE SEES ME DISPOSED OF BUT HE DOES NOT MEAN TO LOSE ME BY IT
YOU CAN FORGIVE YOUR FRIENDS ANYTHING AND WHEN I AM NOT THE FAITHFULLEST OF THOSE NEVER FORGIVE ME
MY BROTHER DID NOT BRING THEM FOR AN EXAMPLE
IF WE SHOULD ONCE COME TO DISPUTES I KNOW WHO WOULD HAVE THE WORST ON'T AND I HAVE NOT FAITH ENOUGH TO BELIEVE A DOCTRINE THAT IS OFTEN PREACH'D WHICH IS THAT THOUGH AT FIRST ONE HAS NO KINDNESS FOR THEM YET IT WILL GROW STRONGLY AFTER MARRIAGE
YET IF I WERE MY COUSIN H
AND MY COUSIN TEMPLE HE SAYS TOLD HIM THAT A NEPHEW OF SIR ROBERT LONG'S WHO IS LATELY COME TO UTRECHT TOLD MY COUSIN TEMPLE THREE WEEKS SINCE YOU WERE NOT TO STAY LONG HERE BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO GREAT A FRIEND TO THESE PEOPLE AND THAT HE HAD IT FROM MR WILLIAMSON WHO KNEW VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID
I WAS UP EARLY BUT WITH NO DESIGN OF GETTING ANOTHER VALENTINE AND GOING OUT TO WALK IN MY NIGHT-CLOAK AND NIGHT-GOWN I MET MR FISH GOING A HUNTING I THINK HE WAS
AND THE FORTUNES OF THE PLACE WERE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED BY A VISIT PAID TO THE SPRINGS BY QUEEN HENRIETTA MARIA ACTING UNDER MEDICAL ADVICE IN 1630 SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH OF PRINCE CHARLES
LAST I HAD IT AND IN EARNEST I KNOW NOT WHETHER AN ENTIRE DIAMOND OF THE BIGNESS ON'T WOULD HAVE PLEASED ME HALF SO WELL
HERE ARE INDEED MANY THINGS OF NO VALUE TO DRYASDUST AND HIS FRIENDS BUT OF MOMENT TO US WHO LOOK FOR AND FIND TRUE DETAILS OF LIFE AND CHARACTER IN NEARLY EVERY LINE
THUS MUCH FOR THE MARRIED PEOPLE NOW FOR THOSE THAT ARE TOWARDS IT
WHEN I ONCE DISCOVER THEM THEY LOSE THEIR CREDIT WITH ME FOR EVER
BUT YOU COULD FANCY A PERFECT HAPPINESS HERE YOU SAY
JUST NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME OF A GENTLEMAN NEAR US THAT IS THE MOST WRETCHED CREATURE MADE BY THE LOSS OF A WIFE THAT HE PASSIONATELY LOVED THAT CAN BE
TO SOME NATURES I THINK IT IS NOT BUT THERE ARE MANY OF SO CARELESS AND VAIN A TEMPER THAT THE LEAST BREATH OF GOOD FORTUNE SWELLS THEM WITH SO MUCH PRIDE THAT IF THEY WERE NOT PUT IN MIND SOMETIMES BY A SOUND CROSS OR TWO THAT THEY ARE MORTAL THEY WOULD HARDLY THINK IT POSSIBLE
SUCH MIRACLES ARE SELDOM SEEN AND YOU MUST PREPARE TO SUFFER A STRANGE PERSECUTION UNLESS YOU GROW CONFORMABLE
BUT LIKE A COUNTRY WASTED BY A CIVIL WAR WHERE TWO OPPOSING PARTIES HAVE DISPUTED THEIR RIGHT SO LONG TILL THEY HAVE MADE IT WORTH NEITHER OF THEIR CONQUESTS TIS RUINED AND DESOLATED BY THE LONG STRIFE WITHIN IT TO THAT DEGREE AS TWILL BE USEFUL TO NONE,--NOBODY THAT KNOWS THE CONDITION TIS IN WILL THINK IT WORTH THE GAINING AND I SHALL NOT TROUBLE ANYBODY WITH IT
LETTER 52._--IT IS INTERESTING TO FIND DOROTHY READING THE GOOD JEREMY TAYLOR'S HOLY LIVING A BOOK TOO LITTLE KNOWN IN THIS DAY
THERE WE MIGHT LIVE LIKE BAUCIS AND PHILEMON GROW OLD TOGETHER IN OUR LITTLE COTTAGE AND FOR OUR CHARITY TO SOME SHIPWRECKED STRANGERS OBTAIN THE BLESSING OF DYING BOTH AT THE SAME TIME
BUT BE IT AS IT WILL I AM CONTENTED TO STAND TO THE LOSS AND PERHAPS WHEN YOU HAVE CHANGED YOU WILL FIND SO LITTLE DIFFERENCE THAT YOU'LL BE CALLING FOR YOUR OWN AGAIN
YOUR OPINION OF MY ELDEST BROTHER IS I THINK VERY JUST AND WHEN I SAID MALICIOUSLY I MEANT A FRENCH MALICE WHICH YOU KNOW DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE SAME WITH AN ENGLISH ONE
THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM GUIZOT'S LIFE OF MONK WILL FULLY EXPLAIN THE ALLUSION
FOR GOD'S SAKE IF YOU MEET WITH IT SEND IT TO ME
IT RUNS THUS
I HAVE TOO MANY OF MY OWN
YOU WILL FIND A PACKET OF LETTERS TO READ AND MAYBE HAVE MET WITH THEM ALREADY
I HAVE NO ENDS NOR NO DESIGNS NOR WILL MY HEART EVER BE CAPABLE OF ANY
HOW NEAR WAS DOROTHY TO THE HIGH PLACES OF THE STATE WHEN THIS MAN AND HENRY CROMWELL WERE AMONG HER SUITORS
I HEARD FROM HIM ON THURSDAY BUT HE DID NOT TELL ME HE HAD SEEN YOU
BUT CERTAINLY THEY RUN A STRANGE HAZARD THAT HAVE SUCH HUSBANDS AS MAKES THEM THINK THEY CANNOT BE MORE UNDONE WHATEVER COURSE THEY TAKE
THUS THEY REMAINED FOR THREE YEARS
I KNOW NOTHING YET THAT IS LIKELY TO ALTER MY RESOLUTION OF BEING IN TOWN ON SATURDAY NEXT
YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK I STAND IN AWE OF MY BROTHER
FOR SINCE THESE TIMES WE HAVE HAD NO COMMERCE WITH THAT FAMILY BUT HAVE KEPT AT GREAT DISTANCE AS HAVING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BEEN DISOBLIGED BY THEM
I SEE NO REMEDY
YOUR GOING ABROAD WILL CONFIRM HIM MUCH IN HIS BELIEF AND I SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO TORMENT ME IN THIS PLACE BUT MY OWN DOUBTS AND FEARS
I DO NOT COUNT THIS SO
WHEN YOU HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOUR FATHER REMEMBER THAT I AM HIS HUMBLE SERVANT AND MUCH CONCERNED IN HIS GOOD HEALTH
IF HE DOES I CANNOT BELIEVE HIS SERMONS WILL DO MUCH TOWARDS BRINGING ANYBODY TO HEAVEN MORE THAN BY EXERCISING THEIR PATIENCE
THIS HELPS US TO DATE THE LETTER
I BELIEVE I SHALL LIVE HERE TILL THERE IS QUITE A NEW LANGUAGE SPOKE WHERE YOU ARE AND SHALL COME OUT LIKE ONE OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS A CREATURE OF ANOTHER AGE
FOR I HAVE BEEN CALLED AWAY TWENTY TIMES SINCE I SAT DOWN TO WRITE IT TO MY FATHER WHO IS NOT WELL
MAY SHE LONG ENJOY IT AND I AN EARLY AND A QUIET GRAVE FREE FROM THE TROUBLE OF THIS BUSY WORLD WHERE ALL WITH PASSION PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS AT THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S CHARGES
ONE CAN PICTURE DOROTHY READING AND MUSING OVER LINES LIKE THESE WITH SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION
BUT SHE CAN BEST TELL WHETHER SHE IS HAPPY OR NOT
SIR RICHARD FRANKLIN KNIGHT MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF SIR THOMAS CHEEKE
BUT I HAVE KNOWN SOME WOMEN THAT HAVE COMMENDED OTHERS MERELY OUT OF SPITE AND IF I WERE MALICIOUS ENOUGH TO ENVY ANYBODY'S BEAUTY I WOULD CRY IT UP TO ALL THAT HAD NOT SEEN THEM
SHE APPEARS TO HAVE RUN AWAY WITH ONE WILLIAM BLUNT,--THE MR BLUNT MENTIONED BY DOROTHY IN HER NEXT LETTER
AND IN EARNEST I COULD NOT BLAME HER
ONCE MORE GOOD-NIGHT
BUT BE IT WHAT IT WILL THAT DISPLEASED YOU I AM GLAD THEY DID NOT FRIGHT YOU AWAY BEFORE YOU HAD THE ORANGE-FLOWER WATER FOR IT IS VERY GOOD AND I AM SO SWEET WITH IT A DAYS THAT I DESPISE ROSES
BUT DID YOU DRINK THEM IMMEDIATELY FROM THE WELL
AND I SAT BY BUT AS NO PART OF THE COMPANY
IN EARNEST I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW KINDLY I TAKE ALL THE OBLIGING THINGS YOU SAY IN IT OF ME
BUT YET I KNOW WHAT TIS TO BE IN THE TOWN
NEVER AGAIN WILL THEIR FAITH BE SHAKEN BY FRETTING AND DESPAIR
THEREFORE IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD TAKE HEED ON'T
THE JEALOUS SIR T HERE MENTIONED MAY BE SIR THOMAS OSBORNE WHO WE MAY SUPPOSE WAS NOT WELL PLEASED AT THE REFUSAL OF HIS OFFER
NICHOLAS BACON WHO WAS VICAR OF CODDENHAM
WHO LEST I SHOULD COMPLAIN RESOLVES TO PREVENT ME AND POSSESS MY FRIENDS FIRST THAT HE IS THE INJURED PARTY
YOU HAVE SO OFTEN REPROACHED ME WITH THE LOSS OF YOUR LIBERTY THAT TO MAKE YOU SOME AMENDS I AM CONTENTED TO BE YOUR PRISONER THIS SUMMER
HOW UNDER A MASK OF FRIENDSHIP I COZENED MYSELF INTO THAT WHICH HAD IT APPEARED TO ME AT FIRST IN ITS TRUE SHAPE I HAD FEARED AND SHUNNED
BUT I DO NOT LIKE THAT ONE'S HAPPINESS SHOULD DEPEND UPON A PERSUASION THAT THIS IS HAPPINESS BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG THEY SHALL CONTINUE IN A BELIEF BUILT UPON NO GROUNDS ONLY TO BRING IT TO WHAT YOU SAY AND TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY OF THE SAME NATURE WITH FAITH
BUT HOWEVER I AM MUCH HIS SERVANT AS HE IS YOUR FATHER
THE TOWN WAS ALREADY A PLACE OF FASHIONABLE RESORT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MINERAL WATERS
BUT I ANSWERED STILL FOR MYSELF THAT TWAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED I SHOULD BE EXACTLY BRED THAT HAD NEVER SEEN A COURT SINCE I WAS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING
WHAT WOULD I GIVE TO KNOW THAT SISTER OF YOURS THAT IS SO GOOD AT DISCOVERING
DESTITUTE OF THE CAPACITY THE ENERGY THE MAGNANIMITY OF HIS ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER DESTITUTE ALSO OF THE MEEK AND PLACID VIRTUES OF HIS ELDER BROTHER THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PERHAPS A MORE FORMIDABLE RIVAL IN LOVE THAN EITHER OF THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
BUT YOU WERE NEVER SO WELCOME THITHER AS YOU SHALL BE WHEN I AM MISTRESS ON'T
AND YET HE HAS NO MORE THE HEART TO ASK ME DIRECTLY WHAT HE WOULD SO FAIN KNOW THAN A JEALOUS MAN HAS TO ASK ONE THAT MIGHT TELL HIM WHETHER HE WERE A CUCKOLD OR NOT FOR FEAR OF BEING RESOLVED OF THAT WHICH IS YET A DOUBT TO HIM
A BLUSH IS THE FOOLISHEST THING THAT CAN BE AND BETRAYS ONE MORE THAN A RED NOSE DOES A DRUNKARD
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT CUSTOM HAS MADE ALMOST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY AND REPUTATION I TAKE TO BE ONE OF THESE
SHE REALLY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A VERY CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN MODEST GENEROUS AFFECTIONATE INTELLIGENT AND SPRIGHTLY
BUT NOW THAT IS CLEARED UP I SHOULD EXPECT YOU SHOULD SAY FINER THINGS TO ME
AND I REMEMBER MY MOTHER USED TO SAY THERE WAS NEVER ANYBODY THAT WAS NOT DEFORMED BUT WERE HANDSOME TO SOME REASONABLE DEGREE ONCE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND TWENTY
AND SO PRETTY THAT IF I HAD ANY DESIGN TO GAIN OF SERVANTS I SHOULD NOT LIKE HER COMPANY
THIS IS INDEED A VERY DISTORTED VIEW OF TEMPLE'S CHARACTER
THAT'S NEXT TO BEING OUT OF THE WORLD
ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENCES ARE NATURAL TO ME AND THAT WHICH IF YOUR KINDNESS WOULD GIVE YOU LEAVE YOU WOULD TERM A WEAKNESS IN ME IS NOTHING BUT A REASONABLE DISTRUST OF MY OWN JUDGMENT WHICH MAKES ME DESIRE THE APPROBATION OF MY FRIENDS
SHE IS THE TALK OF ALL THE FOOTMEN AND BOYS IN THE STREET AND WILL BE COMPANY FOR THEM SHORTLY AND YET IS SO BLINDED BY HER PASSION AS NOT AT ALL TO PERCEIVE THE MISERY SHE HAS BROUGHT HERSELF TO
IS NOT THIS A GREAT DEAL OF NEWS FOR ME THAT NEVER STIR ABROAD
THE RETURN OF THE NEW ADMIRAL MONK WAS MARKED BY A DOMESTIC EVENT WHICH WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS INFLUENCE ON HIS PUBLIC CONDUCT AND REPUTATION
LADY ANNE WENTWORTH WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE FAMOUS AND ILL-FATED EARL OF STRAFFORD
TWOULD MORE ENDANGER GROWING PROUD THAN BEING SIR JUSTINIAN'S MISTRESS AND YET HE THOUGHT ME PRETTY WELL INCLIN'D TO'T THEN
OF HIS DAUGHTER LADY DIANA I CAN LEARN NOTHING BUT THAT SHE DIED UNMARRIED
DIRECTED FOR MRS PAYNTER AT HER HOUSE IN BEDFORD STREET NEXT YE GOATE IN COVENT GARDEN
BUT MR ARBRY'S PROPHECY AND THE FALLING DOWN OF THE FORM DID A LITTLE DISCOMPOSE MY GRAVITY
DO YOU REMEMBER ARME AND THE LITTLE HOUSE THERE
SIR JOHN TEMPLE HIS FATHER WAS MASTER OF THE ROLLS AND A PRIVY COUNCILLOR IN IRELAND
AND MARRIED AT KENSINGTON CHURCH ON MAY 10TH 1653 TO ELIZABETH DAUGHTER OF SIR FRANCIS RUSSELL OF CHIPPENHAM CAMBRIDGESHIRE
HE HAD MARRIED CECILY COMPTON AND NATURALLY ENOUGH ACTED AS HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW'S SECOND
SHE HAS SO TIRED ME WITH BEING HERE BUT TWO DAYS THAT I DO NOT THINK I SHALL ACCEPT OF THE OFFER SHE MADE ME OF LIVING WITH HER IN CASE MY FATHER DIES BEFORE I HAVE DISPOSED OF MYSELF
UNKIND WORDS THESE WITH JUST PERHAPS THOSE DREGS OF TRUTH IN THEM WHICH MAKE GOSSIP SO HARD TO BEAR PATIENTLY
THERE LIES ALL YOUR BUSINESS YOUR FATHER AND FORTUNE MUST DO ALL THE REST
LADY LEPPINGTON OR CAREY LOST HER HUSBAND IN 1649 AND HER SON DIED MAY 24 1653
EVEN RICHELIEU QUOIQU ADMIRATEUR INDULGENT DE LA MEDIOCRITE COULD NOT STAND CALPRENEDE'S TRAGEDIES
MY BROTHER AND MR GIBSON WERE TALKING BY THE FIRE
LETTER 44 SIR,--IF YOU HAVE EVER LOVED ME DO NOT REFUSE THE LAST REQUEST I SHALL EVER MAKE YOU
AFTER KING WILLIAM AND QUEEN MARY WERE ACTUALLY PLACED ON THE THRONE SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE IN 1689 PERMITTED HIS SON TO ACCEPT THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY AT WAR
NOTE WELL THE SIGNATURE OF THIS AND FOLLOWING LETTERS
BUT WHOSOEVER MARRIES WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF FORTUNE SHALL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO DO IT BUT OF SO REASONABLE AN APPREHENSION THE WHOLE WORLD WITHOUT ANY RESERVE SHALL PRONOUNCE THEY DID IT MERELY TO SATISFY THEIR GIDDY HUMOUR
HAD BEEN COQUETTING WITH THE FRENCH KING AND AT LENGTH THE GOVERNMENT THROWING OFF ITS MASK FORMALLY DISPLACED TEMPLE FROM HIS POST IN HOLLAND
THOUGH I HAD RECEIVED NONE FROM YOU I SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THAT OCCASION TO REVENGE MYSELF
IT WILL CERTAINLY I THINK CONCLUDE ME A VERY HAPPY OR A MOST UNFORTUNATE PERSON
NO ASSURE YOURSELF WHAT THAT ALONE CANNOT GAIN WILL BE DENIED TO ALL THE WORLD
HE VOWS HE WAS NOT AND THAT YOUR OLD FRIEND COLLINS NEVER BROUGHT LETTERS OF MY LADY PAYNTER'S IN HIS LIFE
MY LORD MARQUIS HERTFORD HAS LOST HIS SON MY LORD BEAUCHAMP WHO HAS LEFT A FINE YOUNG WIDOW
TWAS NO PART OF MY INTENTION IT SHOULD
ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS NAMED CATHARINE,--HE HAD A WELL-BALANCED FAMILY OF ELEVEN SONS AND ELEVEN DAUGHTERS,--AFTERWARDS MARRIED SIR THOMAS CHEKE
IF TWAS MY HUMBLE THANKS WELL YOU SHALL HAVE NO MORE OF THEM THEN NOR NO MORE SERVANTS
STAY
THE FIVE PORTUGALS TO WHOM DOROTHY REFERS AS BEING HANGED WERE THE PORTUGUESE AMBASSADOR'S BROTHER DON PANTALEON SA AND FOUR OF HIS MEN
OH IF I HAD NOT TERRIFIED MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN WHEN HE BROUGHT ME HIS OWN LETTER NOW SURE I HAD HAD HIM FOR MY VALENTINE
AND WERE IT NOT A STRANGE VANITY IN ME TO BELIEVE YOURS CAN BE LONG-LIVED
NOR ARE HER LETTERS AT ALL THE WORSE FOR SOME PASSAGES IN WHICH RAILLERY AND TENDERNESS ARE MIXED IN A VERY ENGAGING NAMBY-PAMBY
BUT SURE IT IS NOT SAFE TO TAKE ALL LIBERTY THAT IS ALLOWED US,--THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT ARE SOBER ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THEMSELVES
ONLY I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU APPREHEND IT SO FAR AS TO BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE,--THAT WERE AN INJURY TO ALL THE ASSURANCES I HAVE GIVEN YOU AND IF YOU LOVE ME YOU CANNOT THINK ME UNWORTHY
LETTER 70 MY DOUBTS AND FEARS WERE NOT AT ALL INCREASED BY THAT WHICH GIVES YOU SO MANY NOR DID I APPREHEND THAT YOUR FATHER MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN PREVAILED WITH TO HAVE ALLOWED MY BROTHER'S BEING SEEN IN THE TREATY
AND SHE HAS BRED HIM SO STRANGELY THAT HE NEEDS ALL HIS TEN THOUSAND A YEAR
AND FROM THESE THE READER CAN DRAW HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE ACCURACY OF MACAULAY'S DESCRIPTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DOROTHY'S CHARACTER
AND WITHIN HALF A YEAR HER HUSBAND DIED WHICH AFFLICTED HER SO STRONGLY NOBODY THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE LIVED
INTRODUCTION II
AND YET I DO PROTEST I REMEMBER NOTHING MORE OF THEM THAN THIS LAME PIECE A STATELY AND MAJESTIC BROW OF FORCE TO MAKE PROTECTORS BOW
METHOUGHT THEY WERE THE PERFECTEST CHARACTERS OF A CONTENTED MARRIAGE WHERE PIETY AND LOVE WERE ALL THEIR WEALTH AND IN THEIR POVERTY FEASTED THE GODS WHEN RICH MEN SHUT THEM OUT
HOW IDLY HAVE I SPENT TWO SIDES OF MY PAPER AND AM AFRAID BESIDES I SHALL NOT HAVE TIME TO WRITE TWO MORE
TIS THE GENERAL CUSTOM OF ALL PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE THAT ARE RICH TO HAVE MORE MINES OF GOLD THAN ARE IN THE INDIES AND SUCH AS HAVE SMALL FORTUNES TO BE BEGGARS
WE LIVE IN EXPECTATION OF SOME ONE HAPPINESS THAT WE PROPOSE TO OURSELVES AN AGE ALMOST AND PERHAPS MISS IT AT THE LAST
AT THE SECOND BATTLE OF NEWBURY LORD MANCHESTER SHOWED SOME HESITATION IN FOLLOWING UP HIS SUCCESS AND CROMWELL ACCUSED HIM OF LUKEWARMNESS IN THE CAUSE FROM HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
TEMPLE HAS BEEN DOWN TO CHICKSANDS TO SEE HER AND SOME MORE DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN COME TO BETWEEN THEM
THROUGHOUT THIS VOLUME THE ORDINARY NEW YEAR'S DAY HAS BEEN RETAINED
CAN YOU ENDURE THAT WORD
HE WAS ONLY TWENTY
SHE DESIRED ME TO PRESENT HER HUMBLE SERVICE TO HER MASTER,--SHE DID MEAN YOU SURE FOR SHE NAMED EVERYBODY ELSE THAT SHE OWES ANY SERVICE TO,--AND BID ME SAY THAT SHE WOULD KEEP HER WORD WITH HIM
WHAT AN AGE DO WE LIVE IN WHERE TIS A MIRACLE IF IN TEN COUPLES THAT ARE MARRIED TWO OF THEM LIVE SO AS NOT TO PUBLISH TO THE WORLD THAT THEY CANNOT AGREE
TIS MOST CERTAIN THAT I AM OBLIGED TO HIM AND IN EARNEST IF I COULD HOPE IT MIGHT EVER BE IN MY POWER TO SERVE HIM I WOULD PROMISE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF
I WOULD HAVE MY GALLANT CIVIL TO ALL MUCH MORE WHEN IT IS SO DUE AND KINDNESS TOO
I FOUND NO FAULT WITH THE ILL WRITING TWAS BUT TOO EASY TO READ METHOUGHT FOR I AM SURE I HAD DONE MUCH SOONER THAN I COULD HAVE WISHED
LETTER 47 SIR,--'TIS NEVER MY HUMOUR TO DO INJURIES NOR WAS THIS MEANT AS ANY TO YOU
SHE WAS VIOLENT IN EVERYTHING SHE SET ABOUT,--A VIOLENT FRIEND BUT A MUCH MORE VIOLENT ENEMY
AN INQUIRY WAS INSTITUTED BUT THE COMMITTEE NEVER CARRIED OUT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND IN PARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE THE MATTER THEN DROPPED
PRAY TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE HER AND WHAT FAULT YOU FIND IN MY LADY CARLISLE'S LETTER
BUT WERE THEY IRRECOVERABLY LOST THE BEAUTY OF HER MIND WERE ENOUGH TO MAKE HER OUTSHINE EVERYBODY ELSE AND SHE WOULD STILL BE COURTED BY ALL THAT KNEW HOW TO VALUE HER LIKE LA BELLE AVEUGLE THAT WAS PHILIP THE 2ND OF FRANCE HIS MISTRESS
AND THOUGH HE KNEW YOU BEFORE I DID I DO NOT THINK HE KNOWS YOU SO WELL
I WAS NOT HALF SO PLEASED WITH MY ENCOUNTER NEXT MORNING
SEVERAL FIGUR'D ATOMS WELL AGREEING WHEN JOINED DO GIVE ANOTHER FIGURE BEING
I DO REMEMBER YOU ONCE SEALED A LETTER TO ME WITH AS FINE A ONE AS I HAVE SEEN
SIR JOHN TEMPLE LIKE HIS SON IN AFTER LIFE REFUSED TO LOOK ON POLITICS AS A GAME IN WHICH IT WAS ALWAYS ADVISABLE TO PLAY ON THE WINNING SIDE AND THUS WE FIND HIM OPPOSING THE DUKE OF ORMOND IN IRELAND IN 1643 AND SUFFERING IMPRISONMENT AS A PARTISAN OF THE PARLIAMENT
SOME WISE MEN WRITES ONE THOMAS GOWER IN A CONTEMPORARY LETTER STILL UNPRINTED BELIEVE THAT A COUPLE OF COY-DUCKS DREW IN THE REST THEN REVEALED ALL AND WERE EMPLOYED TO THAT PURPOSE THAT THE EXECUTION OF A FEW MEAN PERSONS MIGHT DETER WISER AND MORE CONSIDERABLE PERSONS THIS SEEMS NOT IMPROBABLE
THAT BIT OF PAPER DID ME GREAT SERVICE
POSSIBLY IT IS A WEAKNESS IN ME TO AIM AT THE WORLD'S ESTEEM AS IF I COULD NOT BE HAPPY WITHOUT IT
HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE COUNTRY PARTY WHEN THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT WERE TAKEN FROM THE DISCREDITED CABAL IS NOT MATTER FOR THESE PAGES NEITHER ARE WE MUCH CONCERNED TO KNOW THAT HE WAS GREEDY OF WEALTH AND HONOURS CORRUPT HIMSELF AND A CORRUPTER OF OTHERS
AND SURE YOU NEVER MADE A TRUER REMARK IN YOUR LIFE THAN THAT ALL CHANGES ARE FOR THE WORSE
FOR WERE IT OTHERWISE FORTUNE WOULD NOT PERSECUTE ME THUS
YET TO BE BURNED IN THE HAND WHICH WAS DONE TO THEM BOTH A DAY OR TWO AFTER BUT VERY FAVOURABLY THESE WERE THE FIRST PEERS THAT HAD BEEN BURNED IN THE HAND AND THE DEMOCRATIC EARL OF LEICESTER EXPRESSES AT THE EVENT SOME SATISFACTION AND DERIVES FROM THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRIAL COMFORTABLE ASSURANCE OF THE POWER AND STABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT
I HAVE DEFENDED HIM FROM THE ENVY AND MALICE OF A TROOP OF GREYHOUNDS THAT USED TO BE IN FAVOUR WITH ME
AND TIS CERTAIN I HAD PROVED A MOST EXCELLENT MOTHER-IN-LAW
I THINK I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER ONE THING SHE SAID OF HIM WHICH WAS THAT SHE MARRIED HIM OUT OF PITY
TIS A HANDSOME YOUTH AND WELL-NATURED BUT SUCH A GOOSE
I'LL SWEAR THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ME TIME FOR ANYTHING AND TO SHOW HOW ABSOLUTELY I AM GOVERNED I NEED BUT TELL YOU THAT I AM EVERY NIGHT IN THE PARK AND AT NEW SPRING GARDENS WHERE THOUGH I COME WITH A MASK I CANNOT ESCAPE BEING KNOWN NOR MY CONVERSION BEING ADMIRED
IS IT NOT MY GOOD LORD OF MONMOUTH OR SOME SUCH HONOURABLE PERSONAGE THAT PRESENTS HER TO THE ENGLISH LADIES
HAVE YOU READ CLEOPATRE
LORD MONMOUTH WAS THE ELDEST SON OF THE EARL OF MONMOUTH AND WAS BORN IN 1596
HERE I SHALL FIND ALL THE REPOSE I AM CAPABLE OF AND NOTHING WILL DISTURB MY PRAYERS AND WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS WHICH ONLY CAN MAKE MINE
ALL THIS CONSIDERED WHAT HAVE I TO SAY FOR MYSELF WHEN PEOPLE SHALL ASK WHAT TIS I EXPECT
NO I'LL KEEP THEM TILL YOU COME HITHER
MILTON IS TOO SUBLIME TO BE CALLED OUR FRIEND BUT HE WAS CROMWELL'S FRIEND AT THIS TIME
JUNE THE 6TH 1654 I SEE YOU KNOW HOW TO PUNISH ME
HERE'S IN HELL'S DESPITE NOW KING CHARLES TO THIS TEXT HIS LIFE WROTE THE COMMENT
I WOULD FAIN HAVE HIM MARRY MY LADY DIANA SHE WAS HIS MISTRESS WHEN HE WAS A BOY
LADY GREY'S SISTER MRS POOLEY IS UNKNOWN TO HISTORY
AND WE SHALL NOT FIND OURSELVES FOLLOWING DOROTHY'S STORY WITH THE LESS INTEREST THAT WE HAVE MASTERED THESE DETAILS ABOUT THE OSBORNES OF CHICKSANDS
TELL ME IF THERE BE ANYTHING THAT I CAN SERVE YOU IN EMPLOY ME AS YOU WOULD DO THAT SISTER THAT YOU SAY YOU LOVE SO WELL
JOHN LONGE WHO DIED IN 1835 WAS THE FATHER OF THE PRESENT OWNER
IT OPENS ONE'S EYES TO THE EXAGGERATED GLOOM THAT HAS BEEN THROWN OVER ENGLAND DURING THE PURITAN REIGN BY THOSE HISTORIANS WHO HAVE DERIVED THEIR INFORMATION SOLELY FROM STATE PAPERS AND PROCLAMATIONS
AND I FIND THAT I SHALL WANT NO COMPANY BUT ONLY THAT WHICH I WOULD HAVE AND FOR WHICH I COULD WILLINGLY SPARE ALL THE REST
TIS MORE THAN I KNOW IF MR FREEMAN BE MY SERVANT
AND I SEEMED TO DO SO TOO AND SAID IF I KNEW ANY WOMAN THAT HAD A GREAT FORTUNE AND WERE A PERSON WORTHY OF YOU I SHOULD WISH HER YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
THERE IS A REPORT THAT SHE MARRIED WILLIAM EARL OF CRAVEN BUT THERE IS NO PROOF OF THIS
WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHAT THE INCONVENIENCES OF YOUR COMING HITHER ARE YOU MAY BELIEVE THEY ARE CONSIDERABLE OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT DENY YOU OR MYSELF THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING ONE ANOTHER
MAYO WHO BEING A PROPER MAN THEY SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE BEEN THE SAME ANSTRUTHER THAT REPELLED THEM THE NIGHT BEFORE
THINK WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO LEAVE ME AND BEGIN A NEW ADVENTURE
CONCERNING HIS EMBASSAGE TO SWEDEN THIS IS AGAIN PROPOSED TO HIM IN SEPTEMBER 1653 BUT AS WE READ IN THE MINUTES OF THE COUNCIL WHEN HE WAS DESIRED TO PROCEED FINDING HIMSELF OUT OF HEALTH HE DESIRED TO BE EXCUSED WHEREUPON COUNCIL STILL WISHING TO SEND THE EMBASSY--THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN BEING FAVOURABLY INCLINED TO THE COMMONWEALTH--PITCHED UPON LORD WHITELOCKE WHO WAS WILLING TO GO TO LADY SUNDERLAND AND MR SMITH THERE ARE SEVERAL AMUSING REFERENCES IN THESE LETTERS
I HAVE A GREAT BELIEF THEY DO
AND WHEN HE WAS OTHERWISE HIS HUMOUR WAS TO RISE IN THE NIGHT AND WITH TWO BEDSTAVES LABOUR ON THE TABLE AN HOUR TOGETHER
BUT I INTENDED THIS A SOBER LETTER AND THEREFORE SANS RAILLERIE LET ME TELL YOU I HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ALL OUR MISFORTUNES AND CAN SEE NO END OF THEM BUT BY SUBMITTING TO THAT WHICH WE CANNOT AVOID AND BY YIELDING TO IT BREAK THE FORCE OF A BLOW WHICH IF RESISTED BRINGS A CERTAIN RUIN
THE LAST OF CHICKSANDS
I PROMISED IN MY LAST TO WRITE AGAIN BEFORE I WENT OUT OF TOWN AND NOW I'LL BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD
EARLY LETTERS
FOR IT IS NOT BEAUTY OF FACE AND FORM BUT OF WHAT MEN CALL THE SOUL THAT MADE DOROTHY TO TEMPLE IN FACT AS SHE WAS IN NAME,--THE GIFT OF GOD
HE HAD NONE THAT WAS GOOD THEN BUT PROMISED TO GET ME SOME
HIS NAME IS WELL KNOWN IN HISTORY AS THAT OF THE LEADER OF THE PURITANS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND AS THE ONLY PEER JOINED WITH THE FIVE MEMBERS IMPEACHED BY THE KING
THINKING THUS,"--CONCERNING THE DIGNITY OF HISTORY,"--"WE ARE GLAD TO LEARN SO MUCH AND WOULD WILLINGLY LEARN MORE ABOUT THE LOVES OF SIR WILLIAM AND HIS MISTRESS
IF I CAN BUT KEEP HIM STILL IN THAT HUMOUR MR BENNET AND I ARE LIKELY TO PRESERVE OUR STATE AND TREAT AT DISTANCE LIKE PRINCES
HE COMES DOWN AND MY COUSIN MOLLE IS ALREADY CURED OF HIS IMAGINARY DROPSY AND MEANS TO MEET HERE
SIR,--YOU BID ME WRITE EVERY WEEK AND I AM DOING IT WITHOUT CONSIDERING HOW IT WILL COME TO YOU
IF YOU LOVE ME BE CAREFUL ON'T
IN SOME DEGREE I THINK IT WILL AT LEAST WITH THE MOST RATIONAL PART OF THE WORLD AND AS FAR AS THAT WILL READ I DESIRE IT SHOULD
ALGERNON SYDNEY THE EARL'S SON WAS WELL KNOWN TO TEMPLE AND PERHAPS TO DOROTHY
WHENSOEVER SHE IS ACCUSED OF MAINTAINING OPINIONS VERY DESTRUCTIVE OF SOCIETY AND ABSOLUTELY PREJUDICIAL TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES THAT LIVE IN THE HOUSE SHE CALLS OUT ME TO BE HER SECOND AND BY IT HAS LOST ME THE FAVOUR OF ALL OUR YOUNG GALLANTS WHO HAVE GOT A CUSTOM OF EXPRESSING ANYTHING THAT IS NOWHERE BUT IN FICTION BY THE NAME OF MRS O----'S HUSBAND FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
TIS STRANGE TO SEE THE FOLLY THAT POSSESSES THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THIS AGE AND THE LIBERTY THEY TAKE TO THEMSELVES
FOR MY OWN PART I DO NOT THINK DOROTHY MEANS THAT SHE HAS CEASED TO BE FAITHFUL IN THAT SHE HAS BECOME HIS AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND SERVANT SIR--I WAS SO KIND AS TO WRITE TO YOU BY THE COACHMAN AND LET ME TELL YOU I THINK TWAS THE GREATEST TESTIMONY OF MY FRIENDSHIP THAT I COULD GIVE YOU
LETTER 18._--I CANNOT PASS BY THIS LETTER WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE FIRST PART OF IT IS TO MY THINKING THE MOST DAINTY AND PLEASING PIECE OF WRITING THAT DOROTHY HAS LEFT US
TEMPLE CAN HARDLY HAVE GIVEN CREDENCE TO THESE BUT HE MAY HAVE COMPLAINED OF THEM TO DOROTHY WHO IS LED TO DECLARE I AM THE MOST UNFORTUNATE WOMAN BREATHING BUT I WAS NEVER FALSE THOUGH SHE FORGIVES HER LOVER ALL THOSE STRANGE THOUGHTS HE HAS HAD OF HER
I AM SENSIBLE THAT SUCH AN ABSENCE IS MISFORTUNE ENOUGH BUT I DARE NOT PROMISE MYSELF THAT IT WILL CONCLUDE OURS
AS MACAULAY TELLS US HE WAS BORN IN 1628 THE PLACE OF HIS BIRTH BEING BLACKFRIARS IN LONDON
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME AND THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY OR UNFORTUNATE IN YOUR PERSON AS MUCH OR MORE THAN IN MY OWN DOES NOT GIVE ME THAT CONFIDENCE YOU SPEAK OF
NOT BUT THAT HE DESIGNED A LONGER STAY WHEN HE WENT BUT SINCE HE KEEPS HIS HORSES WITH HIM TIS AN INFALLIBLE TOKEN THAT HE IS COMING
BUT IF YOU SHOULD MEAN BY THAT THAT TIS POSSIBLE HIS WIT AND GOOD PARTS MAY RAISE HIM TO ONE YOU MUST PARDON IF I AM NOT OF YOUR OPINION FOR I DO NOT THINK THESE ARE TIMES FOR ANYBODY TO EXPECT PREFERMENT IN THAT DESERVES IT AND IN THE BEST TWAS EVER TOO UNCERTAIN FOR A WISE BODY TO TRUST TO
BUT BLESS ME WHAT WILL BECOME OF US ALL NOW
I CONFESS I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM AN IMPOSTOR BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED HIM SO SIMPLE A ONE AS WE FOUND HIM
I AM DISPUTING AGAIN THOUGH YOU TOLD ME MY FAULT SO PLAINLY
I WAS AFTERWARDS TOLD THEY WERE OF THE LUKES AND POSSIBLY THIS MAN MIGHT BE THERE OR ELSE I NEVER SAW HIM
GOD FORGIVE ME I WAS AS NEAR LAUGHING YESTERDAY WHERE I SHOULD NOT
IT WILL CONCERN ME THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD KNOW WHAT FORTUNE YOU HAVE AND UPON WHAT TERMS I MARRY YOU THAT BOTH MAY NOT BE MADE TO APPEAR TEN TIMES WORSE THAN THEY ARE
I HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR BEING AT DUBLIN OR AT LONDON AS OUR AFFAIRS STAND
AND IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT AT THIS INTERVIEW ALL WAS PRACTICALLY SETTLED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THOSE TWO WHO WERE MOST DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE NEGOTIATION
TIS MY BROTHER'S SICK DAY AND I'M NOT WILLING TO LEAVE HIM LONG ALONE
WE HAVE A LADY NEW COME INTO THIS COUNTRY THAT I PITY TOO EXTREMELY
THIS IS A STRANGE LETTER SURE I HAVE NOT TIME TO READ IT OVER BUT I HAVE SAID ANYTHING THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR DUMPS
SHE DIED MANY YEARS AGO AND SIR THOMAS MARRIED AGAIN IN 1648 ONE DAME CICELY SWAN A WIDOW WHOSE CHARACTER DOROTHY GIVES US
DO YOU KNOW HIM
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN THE WHOLE WORLD BESIDE AND YET NEGLECT YOURSELF
BUT I HAVE LOST MY HOPES THERE
BUT TIS MY FORTUNE AND I MUST BEAR IT
OH TIS TEN THOUSAND PITIES
METHINKS I SEE YOU LAUGH AT ALL MY THREATENINGS
SOMETIMES WE ARE IN EARNEST AND SOMETIMES IN JEST BUT ALWAYS SAYING SOMETHING SINCE MY BROTHER HENRY FOUND HIS TONGUE AGAIN
LITTLETON AND MRS PHILADELPHIA CAREY WHO IN EARNEST IS A FINE WOMAN SUCH A ONE AS WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT WIFE
THE SQUIRE THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT IS IN ALL PROBABILITY RICHARD BENNET
NO ONE BELIEVES THE DESCRIPTION TO BE TRUE
I DO NOT USE TO FORGET MY OLD ACQUAINTANCES
WHILST I THINK ON'T LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION SERIOUSLY AND PRAY RESOLVE ME TRULY;--DO I LOOK SO STATELY AS PEOPLE APPREHEND
SHE MARRIED LORD ROCKINGHAM
BUT AFTERWARDS I ENGAGED BODY AND SOUL IN THE CAUSE OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT STILL WITH MUCH AFFECTION TO HIS MAJESTY'S PERSON AND UNTO MONARCHY WHICH I EVER LOVED AND APPROVED BEYOND ANY GOVERNMENT WHATSOEVER LILLY WAS IN A WORD A SELF-SEEKING BUT SUCCESSFUL KNAVE
BUT ONE ABOVE ALL THE REST I THINK HE IS IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF AND MAY MARRY HIM TOO IF HE PLEASES I SHALL NOT HINDER HIM
IN EARNEST TIS TRUE
BESIDES THAT YOU OWE IT ME FOR THE LAST BEING SO SHORT
AFTER THE RESTORATION WE FIND HIM APPOINTED LORD-LIEUTENANT OF RUTLAND
LADY GIFFARD HAS LEFT A MANUSCRIPT LIFE OF HER BROTHER FROM WHICH THE HISTORIAN COURTENAY DEIGNED TO EXTRACT SOME INFORMATION WHEREBY WE IN TURN HAVE BENEFITED
SHE HAD A RESTLESS AMBITION LIVED AT A VAST EXPENSE AND WAS RAVENOUSLY COVETOUS
AN OBSTINATE STURDY QUICK-WITTED RACE OF CAVALIERS
SPENCER IS ROBERT SPENCER EARL OF SUNDERLAND LADY SUNDERLAND'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
THE DATE OF THE MARRIAGE IS NOT EXACTLY KNOWN BUT MR COURTENAY SUPPOSES IT TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE ABOUT THE END OF THE YEAR 1654
THEY SAY THE GENTLEMAN THAT WRITES THIS ROMANCE HAS A SISTER THAT LIVES WITH HIM A MAID AND SHE FURNISHES HIM WITH ALL THE LITTLE STORIES THAT COME BETWEEN SO THAT HE ONLY CONTRIVES THE MAIN DESIGN
I TOOK IT UP PRESENTLY AS IF I HAD MEANT IT BUT THREW IT SEALED AS IT WAS INTO THE FIRE AND TOLD HIM AS SOFTLY AS HE HAD SPOKE TO ME I THOUGHT THAT THE QUICKEST AND BEST WAY OF ANSWERING IT
BUT HE MADE SOME QUESTION WHETHER IT WAS NATURAL OR NOT
THERE CAN BE NO PLEASURE IN A STRUGGLING LIFE AND THAT FOLLY WHICH WE CONDEMN IN AN AMBITIOUS MAN THAT'S EVER LABOURING FOR THAT WHICH IS HARDLY GOT AND MORE UNCERTAINLY KEPT IS SEEN IN ALL ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL HUMOURS
THE PRIORY IS A LOW-BUILT SACRO-SECULAR EDIFICE WELL FITTED FOR ITS FORMER SERVICE
SHE HAD OBTAINED HER PASS TO GO OVER TO IRELAND ON AUGUST 24TH 1653
THEY FELL ALSO UPON ONE MR GREENWAY OF LINCOLN'S INN AS HE WAS WALKING WITH HIS SISTER IN ONE HAND AND HIS MISTRESS IN THE OTHER TO WHOM AS I AM INFORMED HE WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED ON TUESDAY NEXT AND PISTOLED HIM IN THE HEAD WHEREOF HE DIED IMMEDIATELY
HENRY CROMWELL WILL BE AS ACCEPTABLE TO ME AS ANY ONE ELSE
NO CERTAINLY THEY ARE AND EVER WILL BE DEAR TO ME AS THAT WHICH I RECEIVE A HUGE CONTENTMENT BY
INDEED HE WAS THEN SO DANGEROUSLY ILL THAT WE COULD NOT REASONABLY HOPE HE SHOULD OUTLIVE THIS DAY
BUT WE SHALL NEVER FALL OUT I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT APT TO IT NEITHER OF US
WOULD YOU THINK IT THAT I HAVE AN AMBASSADOR FROM THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN THAT COMES TO RENEW THE TREATY
I SHALL PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN A QUIET I NEVER HOPE FOR BUT IN MY GRAVE AND I SHALL NEVER CHANGE MY CONDITION BUT WITH MY LIFE
AND WITH THIS ACCOUNT SO ADMIRABLY WRITTEN READY AT HAND IT BECOMES THE CLEAR DUTY OF THE EDITOR TO QUOTE RATHER THAN TO REWRITE
SIR,--IF TO KNOW I WISH YOU WITH ME PLEASES YOU TIS A SATISFACTION YOU MAY ALWAYS HAVE FOR I DO IT PERPETUALLY
AND TO REMOVE THE OPINIONS YOU HAVE OF MY NICENESS OR BEING HARD TO PLEASE LET ME ASSURE YOU I AM FAR FROM DESIRING MY HUSBAND SHOULD BE FOND OF ME AT THREESCORE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM SO AT ALL
DO YOU THINK IN EARNEST I COULD BE SATISFIED THE WORLD SHOULD THINK ME A DISSEMBLER FULL OF AVARICE OR AMBITION
WE HEAR MORE OF DOROTHY'S BEAUTIFUL FRIEND AT THE TIME WHEN THE TREATY WITH SIR HARRY YELVERTON IS GOING FORWARD
IN 1648 SHE APPEARS HOWEVER TO HAVE ASSISTED THE ROYALISTS WITH MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING A FLEET TO ATTACK ENGLAND AND AT THE RESTORATION SHE WAS RECEIVED AT COURT AND EMPLOYED HERSELF IN INTRIGUING FOR THE RETURN OF QUEEN HENRIETTA TO ENGLAND WHICH WAS OPPOSED AT THE TIME BY CLARENDON AND OTHERS
AMBITIONED IS A GREAT WORD WITH HIM AND IGNORE
NEITHER THE GREAT KING NOR THE BEAUTY OF BEDFORDSHIRE NEITHER THE GORGEOUS PARADISE OF MARLI NOR MISTRESS OSBORNE'S FAVOURITE WALK IN THE COMMON THAT LAY HARD BY THE HOUSE WHERE A GREAT MANY YOUNG WENCHES USED TO KEEP SHEEP AND COWS AND SIT IN THE SHADE SINGING OF BALLADS IS ANYTHING TO US
HOWEVER WE HAVE THE TAG OF THEM WITH WHICH WE MUST REST CONTENT
AND WHEREAS I DID EXPECT THAT AT LEAST IN COMPLIMENT TO ME HE SHOULD HAVE SAID WE HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF FOOLS WELL MET HE SAYS BY HIS TROTH HE DOES NOT BLAME YOU BUT BIDS ME NOT DECEIVE MYSELF TO THINK YOU HAVE ANY GREAT PASSION FOR ME
YOU HAD STRANGE LUCK TO MEET MY BROTHER SO SOON
YOU WERE NO SOONER GONE BUT AS IF THAT HAD NOT BEEN ENOUGH I LOST THE BEST FATHER IN THE WORLD
W
BESIDES I CAN MAKE NO CONTRIVANCES
WHERE NOBODY IS PLEASED BUT SOMEBODY COMPLAINS ON'T
I KNOW YOU DO NOT
SHE MARRIED SIR LIONEL TALMASH OF SUFFOLK A GENTLEMAN OF NOBLE FAMILY
WE MUST DECLARE OURSELVES HIS RIVALS
WILL YOU GIVE ME ABSOLUTION
TIS LONG SINCE THAT I KNEW HOW WELL HE WRIT PERHAPS YOU HAVE FORGOT THAT YOU SHOWED ME A LETTER OF HIS TO A FRENCH MARQUIS I THINK OR SOME SUCH MAN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WHEN I FIRST KNEW YOU
AND NOW SIR LET ME TELL YOU THAT I AM EXTREMELY GLAD WHOSOEVER GAVE YOU THE OCCASION TO HEAR FROM YOU SINCE WITHOUT COMPLIMENT THERE ARE VERY FEW PERSONS IN THE WORLD I AM MORE CONCERNED IN
IF SO I HOPE I SHALL FALL INTO NO MORE OF THEM
BUT SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL CONVENIENT FOR HER TO HAVE THEM AT THAT TIME
DO NOT BELIEVE HIM I CHARGE YOU UNLESS YOU DOUBT YOURSELF THAT YOU MAY GIVE ME OCCASION TO CHANGE
THIS IS THE WORLD
HER NIECE HAS LEFT HER
THEY SAY SHE WEARS TWENTY STRUNG UPON A RIBBON LIKE THE NUTS BOYS PLAY WITHAL AND I DO NOT HEAR OF ANYTHING ELSE
THE VALENTINE STORIES WILL DATE THIS LETTER FOR US AS WRITTEN IN THE LATTER HALF OF FEBRUARY
FOR I DO NOT KNOW THAT EVER I DESIRED ANYTHING EARNESTLY IN MY LIFE BUT TWAS DENIED ME AND I AM MANY TIMES AFRAID TO WISH A THING MERELY LEST MY FORTUNE SHOULD TAKE THAT OCCASION TO USE ME ILL
YOU WOULD SEE ME YOU SAY
WHY SHOULD NOT YOU BE AS JUST TO ME
THERE HAD SEEMED A DOUBT WHETHER ALL THESE LETTERS MUST BE REGARDED AS OF ONE SERIES OR WHETHER MORE CORRECTLY IT WAS TO BE ASSUMED THAT DOROTHY AND TEMPLE HAD THEIR LOVERS QUARRELS FOR THE WELL-UNDERSTOOD PLEASURE OF KISSING FRIENDS AGAIN
HE AFTERWARDS MARRIED LADY BRIDGET LINDSAY THE EARL OF LINDSAY'S DAUGHTER AND THE MARRIAGE IS MENTIONED IN DUE COURSE WITH DOROTHY'S COMMENTS
THE AFFAIRS THAT ARE TROUBLING HIM ARE LEGAL MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW HENRY OXENDEN'S ESTATE
OR RATHER HOW MUCH BETTER WOULD IT BE IF THERE NEEDED NONE TO YOU AND THAT I COULD TELL YOU WITHOUT WRITING HOW MUCH I AM YOURS
MY LIFE IS OF SO LITTLE VALUE THAT I WILL NOT MENTION IT
I HAVE YOUR LAST LETTER
YOU THINK I'LL WARRANT YOU HAVE COURAGE ENOUGH TO ENDURE A WORSE SIGHT
YOU SHALL HAVE ALL THE TIME THAT IS ALLOWED ME BUT UPON CONDITION THAT YOU SHALL NOT EXAMINE THE SENSE ON'T TOO STRICTLY FOR YOU MUST KNOW I WANT SLEEP EXTREMELY
NO THANKS BE TO GOD NONE OF MY SERVANTS ARE GIVEN TO THAT
TWAS THE ONLY HAPPINESS I PROPOSED TO MYSELF AND HAD SET MY HEART SO MUCH UPON IT THAT IT WAS THEREFORE MADE MY PUNISHMENT TO LET ME SEE THAT HOW INNOCENT SOEVER I THOUGHT MY AFFECTION IT WAS GUILTY IN BEING GREATER THAN IS ALLOWABLE FOR THINGS OF THIS WORLD
FOR I AM VERY CONFIDENT THEY WERE AND WITH HIS FAVOUR SHALL NEVER BELIEVE OTHERWISE
SPRING GARDENS SEEMS AT ONE TIME TO HAVE HAD NO VERY GOOD REPUTATION
SEE HOW KIND I GROW AT PARTING
BUT LORD WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU
I AM AFRAID WE SHALL MEET WITH TOO MANY REAL ONES
SHE THREATENS TO SEND YOU MORE BUT YOU WOULD FORGIVE HER IF YOU SAW HOW SHE BAITS ME EVERY DAY TO GO TO LONDON
LADY LEICESTER IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN OF A WARM AND IRRITABLE TEMPER AND LORD LEICESTER IS DESCRIBED BY CLARENDON AS STAGGERING AND IRRESOLUTE IN HIS NATURE HOWEVER NOTHING IS SAID OF THEIR QUARRELS
SIR,--PRAY LET NOT THE APPREHENSION THAT OTHERS SAY FINE THINGS TO ME MAKE YOUR LETTERS AT ALL THE SHORTER
SHE MARRIED WILLIAM CAVENDISH SECOND EARL OF DEVONSHIRE
THE PARK AND THE MANSION HE BOUGHT IN 1652 FROM THE EARL OF MONMOUTH AND THE MANOR IN 1655 FROM SIR CHARLES HARBORD
HER FAIR LOOKS LIVING ONLY ON THE PAINTER'S CANVAS UNLESS WE MAY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ETCHED IN DEEPLY BITTEN LINES ON TEMPLE'S HEART
TIS AS CONTRARY TO HIS HUMOUR AS DARKNESS IS TO LIGHT AND ONLY SHOWS THE POWER HE LETS HIS WIFE HAVE OVER HIM
THE EARL OF DANBY WAS THE GOVERNOR OF GUERNSEY AND SIR PETER WAS HIS LIEUTENANT UNTIL 1643 WHEN THE EARL DIED AND SIR PETER WAS MADE FULL GOVERNOR
IN EARNEST TIS TRUE AND I WANT YOUR COUNSEL EXTREMELY WHAT TO DO IN IT
WHAT A DISMAL STORY THIS IS YOU SENT ME
AND IF I KNOW HER AT ALL OR HAVE ANY JUDGMENT HER BEAUTY IS THE LEAST OF HER EXCELLENCES
TIS OUR HYDE PARK AND EVERY FINE EVENING ANYBODY THAT WANTED A MISTRESS MIGHT BE SURE TO FIND ONE THERE
IT MAY BE NUMBERED AMONGST THE REST OF OUR MISFORTUNES ALL WHICH AN INCONSIDERATE PASSION HAS OCCASIONED
LETTER 54._--TEMPLE HAS REALLY STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY AND IS NOW PAST BRICKHILL FAR AWAY IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
SAY WHAT YOU WILL I KNOW SHE MUST BE SO THOUGH I NEVER SAW MORE OF HER THAN WHAT HER LETTERS SHOW
THE HOUSE WAS WELL KNOWN TO TEMPLE WHO DESCRIBES THE GARDENS IN HIS ESSAY ON GARDENING
EDWARD ABBOTT PARRY
SIR YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
YOU HAVE NO SUCH LADIES IN IRELAND
WILLIAM TEMPLE SIR JOHN'S ELDEST SON WAS BORN IN LONDON IN THE YEAR 1628
I SPAKE IT VERY INNOCENTLY AND OUT OF A GREAT SENSE HOW MUCH SHE DESERVES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
BUT DIFFICULTIES AS GREAT AS EVER EXPANDED A NOVEL TO THE FIFTH VOLUME OPPOSED THEIR WISHES
BUT WHAT AN AGE TIS SINCE WE FIRST MET AND HOW GREAT A CHANGE IT HAS WROUGHT IN BOTH OF US
WE COMPLAIN OF THIS WORLD AND THE VARIETY OF CROSSES AND AFFLICTIONS IT ABOUNDS IN AND YET FOR ALL THIS WHO IS WEARY ON'T MORE THAN IN DISCOURSE WHO THINKS WITH PLEASURE OF LEAVING IT OR PREPARING FOR THE NEXT
AND THESE VOWS ARE NEVER BROKEN BUT REMAIN WITH THE LOVERS UNTIL THEY ARE SET ASIDE BY OTHERS TAKEN UNDER THE SOLEMN SANCTION OF THE LAW AND THE OLD TROUBLES VANISH IN NEW RESPONSIBILITIES AND A NEW LIFE
FOR I WAS PERSUADED T'OTHER DAY THAT I COULD NOT BE LESS THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD BY ONE THAT BELIEVED IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS SURE IT WAS A GREAT WHILE SINCE HE HAD HEARD OF SUCH A ONE AS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
BETRAYED HIS TRUST INDEED WHEN HE AND HIS GARRISON ARE REDUCED TO ONE BISCUIT A DAY AND A LITTLE PORRAGE FOR SUPPER TOGETHER WITH LIMPETS AND HERBS IN THE BEST MESS THEY CAN MAKE
I THINK SHE SAID IT WITH AN INTENT TO PLEASE ME AND DID NOT FAIL IN'T
OTHERWISE WHETHER YOU LOVED ME STILL OR WHETHER YOU DID NOT WAS EQUALLY THE SAME TO ME YOUR INTEREST SET ASIDE
OF SHRUBLAND HALL IN THE PARISH OF CODDENHAM
UNTIL HE SEES IT DONE HE WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME TO ME THAT HE IS
BUT ON THE WHOLE I AM NOT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH IT
SIR,--I AM SORRY MY LAST LETTER FRIGHTED YOU SO
I HAVE BEEN SO PERSECUTED WITH VISITS ALL THIS WEEK I HAVE HAD NO TIME TO DESPATCH ANYTHING OF BUSINESS SO THAT NOW I HAVE DONE THIS I HAVE FORTY LETTERS MORE TO WRITE
I KNOW NOT WHETHER HE WAS PLEASED OR NOT BUT I AM SURE I WAS
FOR THERE IS NO ONE THING CAN PROPERLY BE CALLED SO BUT EVERY ONE IS LEFT TO CREATE IT TO THEMSELVES IN SOMETHING WHICH THEY EITHER HAVE OR WOULD HAVE
THE LITTLE TAILOR THAT LOVED QUEEN ELIZABETH WAS SUFFERED TO TALK OUT AND NONE OF HER COUNCIL THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO STOP HIS MOUTH
HE WAS AT THIS TIME TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND HAD BEEN EDUCATED AT ST PAUL'S SCHOOL LONDON AND AFTERWARDS AT WADHAM COLLEGE OXFORD UNDER THE TUTORSHIP OF DR WILKINS CROMWELL'S BROTHER-IN-LAW A LEARNED AND PHILOSOPHICAL MATHEMATICIAN
I REMEMBER I CRIED WHEN I READ IT
LAUD APPEARS TO HAVE PROHIBITED THESE LECTURES
IF IT WOULD IT MUST BE ONLY OUT OF THIS CONSIDERATION THAT SUCH A JEWEL WOULD MAKE ME RICH ENOUGH TO DISPUTE YOU WITH MRS CHAMBERS AND PERHAPS MAKE YOUR FATHER LIKE ME AS WELL
BUT SISTER SAYS HE WOULD YOU HAVE HIM LOVE HER DO YOU DOUBT IT DID I SAY
HE WERE NOT HAPPY IN'T ELSE HE LAUGHED AND SAID MY HUMOUR WAS PLEASANT
SIR,--YOU MUST PARDON ME I COULD NOT BURN YOUR OTHER LETTER FOR MY LIFE
YET I DID NOT SLEEP SO WELL BUT THAT I CHID MY MAID FOR WAKING ME IN THE MORNING TILL SHE STOPPED MY MOUTH WITH SAYING SHE HAD LETTERS FOR ME
FYE
FYE
TIS WORSE THAN DYING BY THE HALF
LORD LISLE WAS THE SON OF ROBERT SIDNEY EARL OF LEICESTER AND BROTHER OF THE FAMOUS ALGERNON
I AM GLAD YOU ARE AN ADMIRER OF TELESILE AS WELL AS I
THE EMPEROR AS DOROTHY CALLS HIM IN WRITING TO TEMPLE MAY FEEL THANKFUL THAT HIS EPITAPH WAS IN OTHERS HANDS THAN HERS
BUT IF THEY COULD BE DIVIDED I AM CERTAIN I SHOULD
I AM YOUR
I AM YOUR
NOTHING IS TALKED OF BUT THESE NEW LEVIES AND THE YOUNG MEN ARE MUCH PLEASED
PRAY FOR MY SAKE BE A VERY OBEDIENT SON
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE LIVED TO HAVE SEEN HIS FROZEN HEART MELTED TIS THE GREATEST CONQUEST SHE WILL EVER MAKE
TIS PITY I CANNOT SHOW YOU WHAT HIS WIT COULD DO UPON SO ILL A SUBJECT BUT MY LADY RUTHIN KEEPS THEM TO ABUSE ME WITHAL AND HAS PUT A TUNE TO THEM THAT I MAY HEAR THEM ALL MANNER OF WAYS
AND BUT THAT HE HAS NOT THE HEART TO HANG HIMSELF HE WOULD BE VERY WELL CONTENTED TO BE OUT OF THE WORLD
IT MUST HANG WITH THE LIGHT ON THE LEFT HAND OF IT
AND THE BEST OF MY COMMENDATIONS WAS THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF BEING COMPANY AND CONVERSATION FOR HIM
TEMPLE NOW COMES TO CHICKSANDS AT AN EARLY DATE
AND HAVE SINCE THANKED GOD I WAS SO FOR TIS NOT LONG SINCE ONE OF MY BROTHERS WRIT ME WORD OF HIM THAT HE WAS KILLED IN A DUEL THOUGH SINCE I HAVE HEARD THAT TWAS THE OTHER THAT WAS KILLED AND HE IS FLED UPON T WHICH DOES NOT MEND THE MATTER MUCH
FOR THOUGH IT MIGHT BE REASONABLY ENOUGH EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD CONFORM MINE TO THEIRS TO MY SHAME BE IT SPOKEN I COULD NEVER DO IT
HE SATISFIES HIMSELF WITH PERSUADING ME EARNESTLY TO MARRY AND TAKES NO NOTICE OF ANYTHING THAT MAY HINDER ME BUT A CARELESSNESS OF MY FORTUNE OR PERHAPS AN AVERSION TO A KIND OF LIFE THAT APPEARS TO HAVE LESS OF FREEDOM IN'T THAN THAT WHICH AT PRESENT I ENJOY
HIS FAMILY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN YEOMEN IN THIS TOWN FOR MANY GENERATIONS
BUT PRAY MAKE IT NO QUARREL
BUT WE HAVE NOT SENT ONE ANOTHER OUR PICTURES YET THOUGH MY COUSIN MOLLE WHO WAS HIS AGENT HERE BEGGED MINE VERY EARNESTLY
WHAT HIS DISPOSITION MAY BE I KNOW NOT
BUT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I KNEW HIM YOU WILL SAY NOTHING ON'T
WHAT IS IT THAT HAS KEPT YOU LONGER
OF THE PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR IN WHICH MY LORD OF DORCHESTER IS SAID TO BE ENGAGED AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH LETTER 59
I DO NOT PRETEND TO ANY SHARE IN YOUR FATHER'S KINDNESS AS HAVING NOTHING IN ME TO MERIT IT
IF IT PROVE AS LONG A ONE I SHALL NOT FORGET YOU
BUT NOW IT WOULD LOOK EXTREMELY UNHANDSOME IN ME AND SURE I HOPE YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT REQUIRE IT OF ME
I HAVE WISHED IT MIGHT AGREE AS WELL WITH YOU AS IT DID WITH ME
WHETHER HE SUCCEEDED IN BELIEVING IN ASTROLOGY AND DECEIVING HIMSELF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
I THINK TWOULD BREAK MY HEART SOONER THAN MAKE ME SHED A TEAR
I DARE CALL NOTHING ON'T MY OWN BUT FAITHFULNESS
HE WAS BORN AT HUNTINGDON IN 1627 THE YEAR OF DOROTHY'S BIRTH
BUT IN EARNEST I WAS HEARTILY TROUBLED TO FIND YOU IN SO MUCH DISORDER
HAVE YOU DESERVED TO BE OTHERWISE
I WOULD FAIN LET YOU SEE THAT I AM EXTREMELY SENSIBLE OF YOUR AFFLICTION THAT I WOULD LAY DOWN MY LIFE TO REDEEM YOU FROM IT BUT THAT'S A MEAN EXPRESSION
THE MARRIAGE ACT OF 1653 WITH THE OTHER STATUTES OF THIS PERIOD HAVE BEEN ERASED FROM THE STATUTE BOOK
WOULD I WERE EASY OF BELIEF
WITH A LITTLE TURN FOR COQUETRY WHICH WAS YET PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH WARM AND DISINTERESTED ATTACHMENT AND A LITTLE TURN FOR SATIRE WHICH YET SELDOM PASSED THE BOUNDS OF GOOD NATURE
YOU KNOW TIS NOT A FEAR OF WANT THAT FRIGHTS ME
BUT DID YOU NOT SAY IN YOUR LAST THAT YOU TOOK SOMETHING VERY ILL FROM ME
BUT THE TRUTH IS I HAD BEEN INQUIRING FOR SOME AS TIS A COMMODITY SCARCE ENOUGH IN THIS COUNTRY AND HE HEARING IT TOLD THE BAILY BAILIFF HE WOULD GIVE HIM SOME IF TWERE FOR ME
WOULD TO GOD YOUR JOURNEY WERE OVER
THAT COMING OUT OF TOWN THE SAME DAY HE CAME IN HE HAD BEEN AT FLEET STREET AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER FOR HIM
TO OUR THINKING TOO IN THE CHARACTER THAT HE DRAWS OF OUR HEROINE MACAULAY HARDLY APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF THE SYMPATHETIC WOMANLY NATURE OF DOROTHY AND THE DIGNITY OF HER DISPOSITION
BUT SINCE HE HAS BEEN WITH A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE WHOM HE SOMETIMES DELIVERS MY LETTERS TO AND BEGGED HER THAT SHE WOULD GO TO ME AND DESIRE MY WORSHIP TO WRITE TO YOUR WORSHIP TO KNOW HOW THE LETTER WAS SEALED FOR IT HAS SO GRIEVED HIM THAT HE HAS NEITHER EAT NOR SLEPT TO DO HIM ANY GOOD SINCE HE CAME HOME AND IN GRACE OF GOD THIS SHALL BE A WARNING TO HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVES
BUT IT WOULD SEEM AS IF NOTHING OF THIS WAS AS YET TO BE KNOWN TO THE OUTER WORLD NOT EVEN TO DOROTHY'S BROTHER
TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU AND ASSURE YOURSELF I AM PERFECTLY YOURS
IN SOME TIS COVETOUSNESS IN OTHERS PRIDE IN SOME STUBBORNNESS OF NATURE THAT CHOOSES ALWAYS TO GO AGAINST THE TIDE AND IN OTHERS AN UNFORTUNATE FANCY TO THINGS THAT ARE IN THEMSELVES INNOCENT TILL WE MAKE THEM OTHERWISE BY DESIRING THEM TOO MUCH
WE HAD A HUGE DINNER THOUGH THE COMPANY WAS ONLY OF HER OWN KINDRED THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE WITH HER AND WHAT I BROUGHT
I DRINK YOUR HEALTH EVERY MORNING IN A DRENCH THAT WOULD POISON A HORSE I BELIEVE AND TIS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE TO PERSUADE MYSELF TO TAKE IT
TO SAY MORE WERE TO SPOIL HIS MARRIAGE WHICH I HEAR IS TOWARDS WITH A DAUGHTER OF MY LORD COLERAINE'S
OR IF I CANNOT I CAN DIE
SIR,--YOU WOULD HAVE ME SAY SOMETHING OF MY COMING
IN POLITICS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF A ROYALIST
AND AT OTHERS I DREAD IT SO EXTREMELY THAT I AM CONFIDENT THE FIVE PORTUGALS AND THE THREE PLOTTERS WHICH WERE T'OTHER DAY CONDEMNED BY THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE HAD NOT HALF MY FEARS UPON THEM
LADY CAREY WAS MARY NATURAL DAUGHTER OF LORD SCROPE WHO MARRIED HENRY CAREY COMMONLY CALLED LORD LEPPINGTON
AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT TO ABOLISH THE CHANCERY WAS INDEED PASSED IN THE AUGUST OF THIS YEAR
IF AN ACTION TAKE A LITTLE IN THE WORLD IT SHALL BE MAGNIFIED AND BROUGHT INTO COMPARISON WITH WHAT THE HEROES OR SENATORS OF ROME PERFORMED
GENT_--THE TRANSLATION WAS PUBLISHED IN THIS YEAR
BUT YOU WILL AGREE THAT THESE LOVERS WERE NOT ALTOGETHER AS OTHER LOVERS ARE THAT THEIR TROUBLES WERE TOO REAL AND TOO MANY FOR THEIR LOVE TO NEED THE STIMULUS OF CONSTANT APRIL SHOWER QUARRELS
OF BRASENOSE OXFORD AND OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE BARRISTER-AT-LAW
THIS SUSPICION WAS SO STRONG UPON ME THAT I CHID TILL THE POOR FELLOW WAS READY TO CRY AND SWORE TO ME THAT IT HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED SINCE HE HAD IT AND THAT HE WAS CAREFUL OF IT AS HE NEVER PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER LETTERS BUT BY ITSELF AND THAT NOW IT COME AMONGST HIS MONEY WHICH PERHAPS MIGHT BREAK THE SEAL
I DO FROM MY SOUL FORGIVE YOU ALL THE INJURIES YOUR PASSION HAS DONE ME THOUGH LET ME TELL YOU I WAS MUCH MORE AT MY EASE WHILST I WAS ANGRY
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY IF EATING AND DRINKING CAN KEEP THEM AWAKE AND I AM KINDLY INVITED TO BE OF THEIR COMPANY
IF EVER THIS COMES TO A TREATY I SHALL DECLARE THAT IN MY OWN CHOICE I PREFER YOU MUCH BEFORE ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE WORLD AND ALL THAT THIS INCLINATION IN ME IN THE JUDGMENT OF ANY PERSONS OF HONOUR AND DISCRETION WILL BEAR I SHALL DESIRE MAY BE LAID UPON IT TO THE UTTERMOST OF WHAT THEY CAN ALLOW
ON TUESDAY I EXPECT HER
LETTER 5._--SIR JUSTINIAN IS THE LOVER HERE DESCRIBED
FOR PROVIDED OUR DUTY TO GOD BE SECURED THEIR COMMANDS ARE WARRANTS TO US IN ALL THINGS ELSE
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE WHITHER IS IT THAT YOU GO
IT WAS THE PITIFULLEST SAYING THAT EVER I HEARD AND MADE HIM SO CONTEMPTIBLE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE MARRIED HIM FOR THAT REASON
AND THOUGH TIS A SIGN OF A SERVILE NATURE WHEN FEAR PRODUCES MORE OF REVERENCE IN US THAN LOVE YET THERE IS MORE DANGER OF FORGETTING ONESELF IN A PROSPEROUS FORTUNE THAN IN THE CONTRARY AND AFFLICTION MAY BE THE SUREST THOUGH NOT THE PLEASANTEST GUIDE TO HEAVEN
AND WE TALKED SO LONG OF IT AND SO DEVOUTLY THAT IT LAID ALL OUR ANGER
THERE ARE STORIES TOO SET ABOUT CONCERNING HER GOOD NAME BY ONE MR B TO DISTURB TEMPLE
DURING THE REMAINING YEARS OF HER LIFE LADY TEMPLE WAS HONOURED TO USE THE CONVENTIONAL PHRASE BY THE FRIENDSHIP OF QUEEN MARY AND THERE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A CONTINUOUS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM THOUGH I CAN FIND ON INQUIRY NO TRACE OF ITS EXISTENCE AT THE PRESENT DAY
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE I WOULD NOT GIVE YOU HOPES OF THAT I CANNOT DO
WE'LL HAVE NO MORE ON'T
GENERAL MONK'S MISFORTUNE IS NO LESS A CALAMITY THAN HIS MARRIAGE
BUT TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK OF THE FORMER WITH IGNORANT ADMIRATION AND OF THE LATTER WITH EQUALLY IGNORANT CONTEMPT
I FIND I AM IN THE HUMOUR OF TALKING WISELY IF MY PAPER WOULD GIVE ME LEAVE
BUT I WOULD NOT WISH YOU TO EXPECT IT
MY LADY DEVONSHIRE WHOSE DAUGHTER HIS FIRST WIFE WAS HAS ENGAGED MY LORD WARWICK TO PUT A STOP TO THE BUSINESS
YOU SEE I GIVE YOU GOOD EXAMPLE
THAT SHE WAS CERTAIN IF HE KNEW ME HE WOULD BE EXTREMELY TAKEN FOR I WOULD MAKE JUST THAT KIND OF WIFE HE LOOKED FOR
AND HAS RECOVERED IT SO WELL THAT YOU SEE SHE CONFESSES THERE IS NOTHING IN HER CONDITION SHE DESIRES TO ALTER AT THE CHARGE OF A WISH
SHE THINKS BECAUSE YOU CALL HER FELLOW-SERVANT SHE MAY USE YOU ACCORDINGLY
WHEN YOU ARE COME OVER WE'L THINK WHERE TO MEET FOR AT THIS DISTANCE I CAN DESIGN NOTHING
FOR I DEFY MY ILL FORTUNE TO MAKE ME MISERABLE UNLESS SHE DOES IT IN THE PERSONS OF MY FRIENDS
BUT PERHAPS IF I COULD REMEMBER THEM THEY ARE NO WISER THAN MY WAKENING DISCOURSES
WHETHER OR NOT DOROTHY REALLY ASSISTED YOUNG SIR HARRY YELVERTON IN HIS SUIT FOR THE HAND OF FAIR LADY RUTHIN WE CANNOT SAY BUT THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY MARRIED
TIS RATHER SURE THAT YOU HAVE A MIND TO TRY ANOTHER THAN THAT ANY DISLIKE OF YOURS MAKES YOU TURN IT OVER TO ME
WHY YOU WENT NO FURTHER
BUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT EVER I SAW I DO NOT LIKE HIS CARRIAGE TOWARDS HER
BUT I SHOULD NOT DOUBT THE CONVINCING THEM IF I COULD HOPE TO BE SO HAPPY AS TO BE YOURS
HOWEVER YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED TO KNOW THAT I CAN ENDURE ALL THAT HE OR ANYBODY ELSE CAN SAY AND THAT SETTING ASIDE MY FATHER'S DEATH AND YOUR ABSENCE I MAKE NOTHING AN AFFLICTION TO ME THOUGH I AM SORRY I CONFESS TO SEE MYSELF FORC'D TO KEEP SUCH DISTANCES WITH ONE OF HIS RELATIONS BECAUSE RELIGION AND NATURE AND THE CUSTOM OF WORLD TEACHES OTHERWISE
MY LORD CAMBDEN TOO HAS FOUGHT WITH MR STAFFORD BUT THERE'S NO HARM DONE
THESE LABOURS HAD BEEN FOLLOWED UP BY MUCH PATIENT RESEARCH THE FRUITS OF WHICH WERE NOW TO BE GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO THE PRESENT EDITOR ON CONDITION THAT HE WOULD PREPARE THE LETTERS FOR THE PRESS
BUT I THANK GOD AN IMAGINATION TOOK HIM ONE MORNING THAT HE WAS FALLING INTO A DROPSY AND MADE HIM IN SUCH HASTE TO GO BACK TO CAMBRIDGE TO HIS DOCTOR THAT HE NEVER REMEMBERS ANYTHING HE HAS TO ASK OF ME BUT THE COACH TO CARRY HIM AWAY
AND FOR MY PART I AM RESOLVED TO STAY TILL THAT COMES IN FASHION AGAIN
I HAVE ONE THAT WAS THE GENERAL'S
AND HAVING GENEROUSLY BUILT AND FURNISHED A PARSONAGE HOUSE HE PRESENTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE CELEBRATED PREACHER THOMAS BRIGHTMAN WHO DIED THERE IN 1607
THE LORD OF LEARNE THIS WAS THE OLD SPELLING MAY BE FOUND IN BISHOP PERCY'S WELL-KNOWN COLLECTION OF BALLADS AND ROMANCES
HIS KINDNESS TO HIS FIRST WIFE MAY GIVE HIM AN ESTEEM FOR HER SISTER
BUT IT WILL EASILY BE GRANTED THAT MOST PEOPLE MAKE HASTE TO BE MISERABLE
BUT THIS IS THE WORLD AND SHE MAKES A PART OF IT BETIMES
BUT I MAY SAY TO YOU AS TO A FRIEND I DO NOT LIKE THEM AND HAVE WONDERED THAT MY SISTER WHO I MAY TELL YOU TOO AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT VANITY IN ME HAD A GREAT DEAL OF WIT AND WAS THOUGHT TO WRITE AS WELL AS MOST WOMEN IN ENGLAND NEVER PERSUADED HIM TO ALTER HIS STYLE AND MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE INTELLIGIBLE
NOR DID ANY LIBELLER EVER IMPUTE PARSIMONY TO SHERIDAN OR PROFUSION TO MARLBOROUGH
BUT WHERE IT IS THERE IS HAPPINESS
IT SEEMS HE WAS FOR WHEN I HAD SPOKE FREELY MY MEANING IT WROUGHT SO WITH HIM AS TO FETCH UP ALL THAT LAY ON HIS STOMACH
TWAS THE FIRST TIME I MADE USE OF THAT DIRECTION
HERE IS A NOTE COMES TO ME JUST NOW WILL YOU DO THIS SERVICE FOR A FINE LADY THAT IS MY FRIEND
NOW WITH BOTH THESE HE SO PERFECTLY COMPLIED THAT TIS HARD TO JUDGE WHICH HUMOUR HE IS MORE INCLINED TO IN HIMSELF
THE LOFTY CORNELIA-LIKE SPIRIT OF THE AGED MATRON SEEMS TO MELT INTO A LONG FORGOTTEN SOFTNESS WHEN SHE RELATES HOW HER BELOVED COLONEL MARRIED HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS ABLE TO QUIT THE CHAMBER WHEN THE PRIEST AND ALL THAT SAW HER WERE AFFRIGHTED TO LOOK ON HER
WELL GOD FORGIVE ME AND YOU TOO YOU MADE ME TELL A GREAT LIE
SEND SOME ONE WHEN YOU ARE THERE AND YOU SHALL HAVE FURTHER DIRECTIONS
LADY ALICE HALKETT WRITING IN 1644 TELLS US THAT SO SCRUPULOUS WAS I OF GIVING ANY OCCASION TO SPEAK OF ME AS I KNOW THEY DID OF OTHERS THAT THOUGH I LOVED WELL TO SEE PLAYS AND TO WALK IN THE SPRING GARDENS SOMETIMES BEFORE IT GREW SOMETHING SCANDALOUS BY THE ABUSES OF SOME YET I CANNOT REMEMBER THREE TIMES THAT EVER I WENT WITH ANY MAN BESIDES MY BROTHER HOWEVER FASHIONS CHANGE IN TEN YEARS AND SPRING GARDENS IS DOUBTLESS NOW QUITE DEMURE AND RESPECTABLE OR WE SHOULD NOT FIND DOROTHY THERE
I HAVE BEEN AS LARGE AND AS PARTICULAR IN MY DESCRIPTIONS AS MY COUSIN MOLLE IS IN HIS OF MOOR PARK,--BUT THAT YOU KNOW THE PLACE SO WELL I WOULD SEND IT YOU,--NOTHING CAN COME NEAR HIS PATIENCE IN WRITING IT BUT MY READING ON'T
CONSIDER YOURSELF ONLY AND NOT ME AT ALL,--'TIS NO MORE THAN I DESERVE FOR NOT ACCEPTING WHAT YOU OFFERED ME WHILST TWAS IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE IT GOOD AS YOU SAY IT THEN WAS
I KNOW NOT WHAT HUMOUR YOU WERE IN WHEN YOU WRIT IT
I HAVE NO PATIENCE NEITHER FOR THESE TRANSLATIONS OF ROMANCES
SHE AFTERWARDS LIVED WITH TEMPLE AND HIS WIFE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH THEM AND THEIR CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND
IT IS COPIED FROM COURTENAY VOL
HE WAS A FRIEND OF THE FAMOUS SAMUEL BUTLER
I'LL WRITE AGAIN BEFORE I LEAVE THE TOWN AND SHOULD HAVE WRIT MORE NOW BUT COMPANY IS COME IN
THEREFORE TILL I FOUND THE PERMISSION YOU GAVE ME I HAD LAID IT BY WITH A RESOLUTION NOT TO READ IT BUT TO SEND IT AGAIN
BUT THAT'S IN NOBODY'S POWER AND MY LADY TALMASH THAT SAYS SHE CAN DO WHATSOEVER SHE WILL CANNOT BELIEVE WHATSOEVER SHE PLEASES
AND IN THE LATTER PART OF CROMWELL'S REIGN THE GLOOM AND THE STRAIT-LACED REGULATIONS THAT CAUSED IT MUST HAVE ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
THOSE THAT HAVE FORTUNES HAVE NOTHING ELSE AND THOSE THAT WANT IT DESERVE TO HAVE IT
IT RESULTED IN THE EXECUTION OF DON PANTALEON SA AND FOUR OF HIS SERVANTS
HE THEREFORE SENT A BOAT THINKING IT POSSIBLE THAT THE YACHT MIGHT BE IN DISTRESS
I HAVE NOT DONE YET
BUT I HAVE LIVED TO SEE IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK PEOPLE WORSE THAN THEY ARE AND SO WILL YOU I DID NOT BELIEVE HER AND LESS THAT I SHOULD HAVE MORE TO SAY TO YOU THAN THIS PAPER WOULD HOLD
WITH ALL THIS IS IT NOT MANIFEST TO THE WHOLE WORLD THAT MR BLUNT COULD NOT CONSIDER ANYTHING IN THIS ACTION BUT HIS OWN INTEREST AND THAT HE MAKES HER A VERY ILL RETURN FOR ALL HER KINDNESS
DOROTHY OSBORNE WAS TWENTY-ONE
THE TIMES WERE NOT FAVOURABLE TO STUDY
I DARE NOT HOPE IT
I DARE NOT HOPE IT
AND BESIDES I EXPECTED TO FIND WHEN I CAME HOME A LETTER FROM YOU THAT WOULD BE MORE A FEAST AND COMPANY TO ME THAN ALL THAT WAS THERE
AND PRINTED RECORDS HAVE BEEN SO LITTLE SUCCESSFUL
FOR REASONS NOW OBSCURE AND UNKNOWABLE HE DROWNED HIMSELF IN THE THAMES WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS ACCEPTANCE OF OFFICE LEAVING THIS WRITING BEHIND HIM MY FOLLY IN UNDERTAKING WHAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM HAS DONE THE KING AND KINGDOM A GREAT DEAL OF PREJUDICE
IN THE CASE OF WELL-KNOWN MEN LIKE ALGERNON SYDNEY LORD MANCHESTER EDMUND WALLER ETC NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO WRITE A COMPLETE NOTE,--THEIR LIVES AND WORKS BEING SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN
FAITH ONCE GONE HOPE MISSING HER COMRADE FLIES AWAY IN SEARCH OF HER
SAY WHAT YOU WILL YOU CANNOT BUT KNOW MY HEART ENOUGH TO BE ASSURED THAT I WISH MYSELF WITH YOU FOR MY OWN SAKE AS WELL AS YOURS
HOWEVER FROM ANTHONY WOOD AND OTHER SOURCES ONE GATHERS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT DETAILS OF HER LIFE AND WRITINGS
IN EARNEST CONSIDER ON'T AND TAKE SOME COURSE THAT YOUR HEALTH AND MY LETTERS MAY BE BOTH SECURED FOR THE LOSS OF EITHER WOULD BE VERY SENSIBLE TO YOUR HUMBLE
THE BEST ON'T IS I BELIEVE NONE OF THEM UNLESS IT BE THAT OF MY LADY NEWPORT WHICH I MUST CONFESS IS SO LIKE HER THAT IF IT BE NOT TRUE TWAS AT LEAST EXCELLENTLY WELL FANCIED
TEMPLE HAD PROBABLY RETURNED FROM A JOURNEY INTO YORKSHIRE,--HIS TRAVELS IN HOLLAND WERE OVER SOME TIME AGO,--AND PASSING THROUGH BEDFORD WITHIN TEN MILES OF CHICKSANDS HE NEGLECTED TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO DOROTHY FOR WHICH HE IS DULY CALLED TO ACCOUNT IN LETTER 3
I THANK GOD I NEVER DISTRUSTED HIS PROVIDENCE NOR I HOPE NEVER SHALL AND WITHOUT ATTRIBUTING ANYTHING TO MYSELF I MAY ACKNOWLEDGE HE HAS GIVEN ME A MIND THAT CAN BE SATISFIED WITH AS NARROW A COMPASS AS THAT OF ANY PERSON LIVING OF MY RANK
BUT SINCE ALL PEOPLE ARE SEEN OR KNOWN AND SHALL BE TALKED OF IN SPITE OF THEIR TEETH WHO IS IT THAT DOES NOT DESIRE AT LEAST THAT NOTHING OF ILL MAY BE SAID OF THEM WHETHER JUSTLY OR OTHERWISE
HE RECEIVED HIS EARLY EDUCATION UNDER HIS MATERNAL UNCLE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO SCHOOL AT BISHOP-STORTFORD AND AT SEVENTEEN BEGAN TO RESIDE AT EMMANUEL COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE WHERE THE CELEBRATED CUDWORTH WAS HIS TUTOR
ADDRESSED FOR MRS PAYNTER AT HER HOUSE IN BEDFORD STREET NEXT YE GOATE IN COVENT GARDEN
IF THIS BE NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO MORE
BUT HIS BUSINESS WAS TO PAINT ALL MEN'S PORTRAITS
THEN HE WAS BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMS AND CEREMONIES OF JUSTICE ADJUDGED TO DEATH
FOR A MOMENT SHE LOSES FAITH NOT IN TEMPLE BUT IN FORTUNE
MY BROTHER THEN HAVING A QUARREL WITH MR THOMAS HOWARD SECOND SON TO THE EARL OF BERKSHIRE ABOUT MRS HARESON WITH WHOM HE ALSO WAS IN LOVE MR RICH BROUGHT MY BROTHER A CHALLENGE FROM MR HOWARD AND WAS SECOND TO HIM AGAINST MY BROTHER WHEN THEY FOUGHT WHICH THEY DID WITHOUT ANY GREAT HURT OF ANY SIDE BEING PARTED
BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYTHING MORE IS NECESSARY TO ONE'S OWN SAFETY BESIDES A PRUDENT CAUTION
THIS ETCHING BY THOMAS FISHER OF DECEMBER 26 1816 IS THE MORE VALUABLE TO US SINCE THE OLD CHICKSANDS PRIORY NO LONGER REMAINS HAVING SUFFERED MARTYRDOM AT THE BLOODY HANDS OF THE RESTORER
EVERY COACH AND HORSE WHICH ENTERS BUYING HIS MOUTHFUL AND PERMISSION OF THE PUBLICAN WHO HAS PURCHASED IT FOR WHICH THE ENTRANCE IS GUARDED WITH PORTERS AND LONG STAVES
NOTHING CAN PLEASE ME BETTER
I CHID HIM ONCE FOR A SEAL HE SET ME JUST OF THIS FASHION AND THE SAME COLOURS
I KNOW NOT WHETHER MY LETTER WERE KIND OR NOT BUT I'LL SWEAR YOURS WAS NOT AND AM SURE MINE WAS MEANT TO BE SO
HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR MAKING THE FIRST HE DREW FOR ME A LITTLE WORSE THAN I AND IN MAKING THIS BETTER HE HAS MADE IT AS UNLIKE AS T'OTHER
I AM CALLED AWAY,--FAREWELL
TO BEGIN THIS LET ME TELL YOU I HAD NOT FORGOT YOU IN YOUR ABSENCE
I NEVER MAGNIFIED MY PATIENCE TO YOU BUT I BEGIN TO HAVE A GOOD OPINION ON'T SINCE THIS TRIAL
TIS TRUE I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE HIM ALWAYS KIND AND KNOW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD BE WEARIER OF BEING MY MASTER THAN HE WAS OF BEING MY SERVANT
YOU SAY NOTHING HOW YOUR SISTER DOES WHICH MAKES ME HOPE THERE IS NO MORE OF DANGER IN HER SICKNESS
THIS LED TO HIS RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC LIFE IN 1658
BESIDES I CANNOT TELL WHETHER IT BE VERY LIKE ME OR NOT THOUGH TIS THE BEST I EVER HAD DRAWN FOR ME AND MR LILLY LELY WILL HAVE IT THAT HE NEVER TOOK MORE PAINS TO MAKE A GOOD ONE IN HIS LIFE AND THAT WAS IT I THINK THAT SPOILED IT
ULTIMATELY BULSTRODE WHITELOCKE IS CHOSEN AMBASSADOR
YOU CONFESS TIS AN AGE SINCE OUR STORY BEGAN AS IS NOT FIT FOR ME TO OWN
YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING TO THANK ME FOR AFTER THIS
I WILL NOT OBLIGE YOU TO COURT A PERSON THAT HAS INJURED YOU
I CAN BUT THINK HOW I SHALL SIT LIKE THE LADY OF THE LOBSTER AND GIVE AUDIENCE AT BABRAM
SHE'S CRUEL AND HOW FAR HER POWER MAY REACH I KNOW NOT ONLY I AM SURE SHE CANNOT CALL BACK TIME THAT IS PAST AND IT IS LONG SINCE WE RESOLVED TO BE FOR EVER MOST FAITHFUL FRIENDS
I FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO TALK OF YOUR COMING BACK THAN YOUR GOING
HER FATHER HENRY RICH LORD HOLLAND THE SECOND SON OF THE EARL OF WARWICK HAS FOUND PLACE IN STERNER HISTORY THAN THIS
THE NEXT WILL CERTAINLY TELL YOU
I CANNOT SO MUCH AS DISGUISE MY HUMOUR
BUT YOU WOULD BE SO COURTEOUS AS TO STAY I HOPE IF WE ENTREATED YOU
BUT OF LATE I KNOW NOT HOW SIR SAM HAS GROWN SO KIND AS TO SEND TO ME FOR SOME THINGS HE DESIRED OUT OF THIS GARDEN AND WITHAL MADE THE OFFER OF WHAT WAS IN HIS WHICH I HAD REASON TO TAKE FOR A HIGH FAVOUR FOR HE IS A NICE FLORIST
BUT THE SUN IS SET AND THE BEAUTIFUL QUEEN'S SAD ROMANTIC STORY ALMOST FORGOTTEN
NOT AS THEY COME FROM ONE THAT IS NOT INDIFFERENT TO ME BUT SERIOUSLY I DO
I COULD NEVER WRITE A LETTER FROM THENCE IN MY LIFE OF ABOVE A DOZEN LINES
SHE SAID NO MORE NOR I NEITHER
MY COUSIN MOLLE WENT FROM HENCE TO CAMBRIDGE ON THURSDAY AND THERE'S AN END OF MR BENNET
I TOLD HER AS I THOUGHT SHE COULD NOT PUT A MORE INNOCENT THING THERE FOR I DID NOT FIND IT HAD ANY SMELL AT ALL
WHY SHOULD YOU THINK ME SO CARELESS OF ANYTHING THAT YOU WERE CONCERNED IN AS TO DOUBT THAT I HAD WRIT
HERE IS ENOUGH TO KILL 1000 SUCH AS I AM AND SO EXTREMELY GOOD THAT NOTHING BUT YOUR POWER CAN SECURE ME
I HAVE WONDERED OFTEN TO MEET MY FAIR LADY RUTHIN THERE ALONE
WILL YOU FORGIVE IT ME
HE KNOWS THAT IF I WERE MARRIED AT THIS PRESENT I SHOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO LEAVE MY FATHER AS LONG AS HE LIVES
THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF LETTERS IN THE MSS
SHE CANNOT SEE AND THEREFORE I MAY VENTURE TO WRITE THAT I INTEND TO BE IN LONDON IF IT BE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY OR SATURDAY COME SENNIGHT
WHO KNOWS NOT WHAT MISCHANCES AND HOW GREAT CHANGES HAVE OFTEN HAPPENED IN A LITTLE TIME
YET HE WAS AS HANDSOME AS YOUR VALENTINE
HE WAS COMING AS FAST AS A COACH AND SIX HORSES COULD CARRY HIM BUT I DESIRED HIM TO STAY TILL MY AGUE WAS GONE AND GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME TO RECOVER MY GOOD LOOKS
WE FIND IT ADVERTISED IN MERCURIUS POLITICUS 19TH JANUARY 1654:--"_PARTHENISSA THAT MOST FAMOUS ROMANCE COMPOSED BY THE LORD BROGHILL AND DEDICATED TO THE LADY NORTHUMBERLAND IT IS A ROMANCE OF THE STYLE OF CLEOPATRE AND CYRUS TO ENJOY WHICH IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WOULD REQUIRE A CURIOUS AND ACQUIRED TASTE
I CAN RESIST WITH EASE ANY SORT OF PEOPLE BUT BEGGARS
YOU WILL BELIEVE YOU ARE NOT FORGOT THEN
SOMETHING THE REALITY OF WHICH WILL GROW DOUBTFUL TO HER IF SHE FIND IDLE HOURS FOR DREAMING AND DOUBTING IN HER NEW NAME
I AM NOT SECURE THAT IT WOULD NOT MAKE ME DO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT THINGS IN THE WORLD AND I SHALL BE FORCED TO KEEP A CONTINUAL WAR ALIVE WITH IT AS LONG AS THERE ARE ANY REMAINDERS OF IT LEFT;--I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID AS LONG AS I LIVED
AND PRAY TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE HER ONE VISIT FROM ME AND CARRY MY HUMBLE SERVICE WITH YOU AND TELL HER THAT TIS NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU ARE NO BETTER
HE WENT UP BUT LAST TUESDAY
I HAVE A HEART STILL THAT CANNOT RESOLVE TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING WITHIN ITS POWER TO GRANT
I SPEAK OF MASTER IZAAK WALTON WHO IN THIS YEAR 1653 PUBLISHED THE FIRST EDITION OF HIS COMPLEAT ANGLER AND LEFT A COMRADE FOR THE IDLE HOURS OF ALL FUTURE AGES
I AM GOT INTO MY COMPLAINING HUMOUR THAT TIRES MYSELF AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHICH AS YOU OBSERVE HELPS NOT AT ALL
MY DEAREST DEAR ADIEU
IT WILL COME VERY SEASONABLY AFTER MY CHIDING AND I HAVE GREAT REASON TO EXPECT YOU SHOULD BE IN THE HUMOUR OF DOING ANYTHING FOR ME
WHAT DOES MY LORD LISLE
FOR THOUGH HE SHOULD BREAK HIS PROMISE HE SHOULD NEVER MAKE ME BREAK MINE
AND IF I WAS AS MUCH TAKEN AS HE WITH MR TALBOT I SHOULD NOT BE LESS GALLANT
WELL I'LL THINK ON'T AND IF IT SUCCEED I WILL BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD
AND SO WE PARTED
I MAY OWN YOU AS A PERSON THAT I EXTREMELY VALUE AND ESTEEM AND FOR WHOM I HAVE A PARTICULAR FRIENDSHIP AND YOU MAY CONSIDER ME AS ONE THAT WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FAITHFUL
TWAS BROUGHT OUT OF THE INDIES AND CUT THERE FOR AN IDOL'S HEAD
BUT SURE HE GIVES HIMSELF ANOTHER REASON FOR TIS NOT VERY LONG SINCE HE TOOK OCCASION TO INQUIRE FOR YOU VERY KINDLY OF ME
AND YET YOU CANNOT WONDER AT IT
THE POOR GIRL WAS EXCEEDINGLY HURT AND IRRITATED BY THESE IMPUTATIONS ON HER LOVER DEFENDED HIM WARMLY BEHIND HIS BACK AND ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF SOME VERY TENDER AND ANXIOUS ADMONITIONS MINGLED WITH ASSURANCES OF HER CONFIDENCE IN HIS HONOUR AND VIRTUE
THUS DOST THOU SIT LIKE MEN E'ER SIN HAD FRAMED A GUILTY BLUSH NAKED BUT NOT ASHAMED
I WOULD NOT DIE WITHOUT IT
I AM APT TO SPEAK WHAT I THINK
THEN AM I READY TO BEAT HER WITH THE BATTLEDORE AND GROW SO PEEVISH AS I GROW SICK THAT I'LL UNDERTAKE SHE WISHES THERE WERE NO STEEL IN ENGLAND
YOU PROMISED ME AND THAT'S ALL THE SECURITY I CAN HAVE IN THIS WORLD
CAN I REMEMBER HOW IGNORANTLY AND INNOCENTLY I SUFFERED IT TO STEAL UPON ME BY DEGREES
IF YOU READ IT WHEN YOU GO TO BED TWILL CERTAINLY MAKE YOUR SLEEP APPROVED
NOR WAS NOT
MY SISTER WAS A MELANCHOLY RETIRED WOMAN AND BESIDES THE COMPANY OF HER HUSBAND AND HER BOOKS NEVER SOUGHT ANY BUT COULD HAVE SPENT A LIFE MUCH LONGER THAN HERS WAS IN LOOKING TO HER HOUSE AND HER CHILDREN
WE CAN IMAGINE HER SPEAKING WITH SYMPATHETIC ACCENT LINES SUCH AS THESE
IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TO BE SURE LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH WAS A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PERSON THAN TEMPLE'S SWEETHEART
LETTER I._--GORING HOUSE WHERE DOROTHY AND TEMPLE HAD LAST PARTED WAS IN 1646 APPOINTED BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR
YET I'LL SWEAR OF LATE I HAVE USED HIM SO NEAR TO RUDELY THAT THERE IS LITTLE LEFT FOR ME TO DO
FOR ME TIS A BETTER-NATURED AND A LESS FAULT TO BELIEVE TOO MUCH THAN TO DISTRUST WHERE THERE IS NO CAUSE
THIS IS A STRANGE REQUEST FOR ME TO MAKE THAT HAVE BEEN FONDER OF YOUR LETTERS THAN MY LADY PROTECTOR IS OF HER NEW HONOUR AND IN EARNEST WOULD BE SO STILL BUT THERE ARE A THOUSAND INCONVENIENCES IN'T THAT I COULD TELL YOU
THIS IS A STRANGE CONFUSED ONE I BELIEVE
HOWEVER CIRCUMSTANCES AND SIR GEORGE CARTERET WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND AT THE REQUEST OF PRINCE CHARLES HE RESIGNED HIS COMMAND TO SIR BALDWIN WAKE IN MAY 1646 REMAINING THREE YEARS AFTER THIS DATE AT ST MALO WHERE HE DID WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF THE CASTLE
HE CAME DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY WHERE SHE WAS UPON A VISIT AND ONE MORNING MARRIED HER
WHEN SHE DECLARES THAT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE CHOSEN A CHAIN TO LEAD HER APES IN THAN MARRY SIR JUSTINIAN SHE REFERS TO AN OLD SUPERSTITION AS TO THE ULTIMATE FATE OF SPINSTERS WOMEN DYING MAIDS LEAD APES IN HELL RUNS THE VERSE OF AN OLD PLAY AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SUPERSTITION THE ORIGIN OF WHICH SEEMS SOMEWHAT INEXPLICABLE
SIR,--'TIS WELL YOU HAVE GIVEN OVER YOUR REPROACHES
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO AMONGST ALL THAT COMPANY UNLESS SHE BE TOWARDS A WEDDING
SHE RISES FROM HER BED HER BEAUTY OF FACE DESTROYED
NO OTHER WOULD PLEASE ME HALF SO WELL
HE HAD MARRIED DOROTHY SISTER OF SIR JOHN DANVERS
HE TOLD ME TOO THAT THOUGH HE HAD CARRIED HIS ADDRESSES TO ME WITH ALL THE PRIVACY THAT WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE HE SAW I LIKED IT BEST AND THAT TWAS PARTLY HIS OWN HUMOUR TOO YET SHE HAD DISCOVERED IT AND COULD TELL THAT THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A THING AND THAT IT WAS BROKE OFF AGAIN SHE KNEW NOT WHY
LET ME HEAR OFTEN FROM YOU AND LONG LETTERS
YET TAKE HEED OF BEING LIKE MY NEIGHBOUR'S SERVANT HE IS SO TRANSPORTED TO FIND NO RUBS IN HIS WAY THAT HE KNOWS NOT WHETHER HE STANDS ON HIS HEAD OR HIS FEET
YOU THINK HIM KIND FROM A LETTER THAT YOU MET WITH OF HIS
BUT IT HAS BEEN RATHER TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK WITH OF YOU THAN THAT I NEEDED ANYBODY TO PUT ME IN MIND OF YOU AND WITH ALL HER DILIGENCE I SHOULD HAVE OFTEN PREVENTED HER IN THAT DISCOURSE
MY ELDEST BROTHER IS NOW HERE AND WE EXPECT MY YOUNGEST SHORTLY AND THEN WE SHALL BE ALTOGETHER WHICH I DO NOT THINK WE EVER WERE TWICE IN OUR LIVES
MRS GOLDSMITH IS AS YOU WILL REMEMBER WIFE OF THE VICAR OF CAMPTON
OTHERWISE I THINK HIS PRESENT WANT OF FORTUNE AND THE LITTLE SENSE OF HONOUR HE HAS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREVAILED ON TO MARRY HER
IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE SENT YOU THE FIRST TOME OF CYRUS TO READ
I NEVER THOUGHT MY LIFE WORTH MY CARE WHILST NOBODY WAS CONCERNED IN'T BUT MYSELF
P
P
WOULD YOU HAD SENT ME YOUR FATHER'S LETTER IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS WELCOME TO ME THAN TO YOU
TWO OR THREE GREAT GLISTENING JEWELS HAVE BRIBED HER TO WINK AT ALL HIS FAULTS AND SHE HEARS HIM AS UNMOVED AND UNCONCERNED AS IF ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY HIM
BUT I HAVE HAD THE FOLLOWING OF A MOST LABORIOUS AFFAIR WHICH HATH COST ME THE TRAVELLING THOUGH IN OUR OWN COUNTRY STYLE FIFTY
AS LITTLE ROOM AS I HAVE LEFT TOO I MUST TELL YOU WHAT A PRESENT I HAD MADE ME TO-DAY
YOU LITTLE THINK I HAVE BEEN WITH LILLY AND IN EARNEST I WAS THE DAY BEFORE I CAME OUT OF TOWN
LETTER 41._--LADY ANNE BLUNT WAS A DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF NEWPORT
I NEVER HAD ANY QUARREL TO IT AND SINCE OUR FRIENDSHIP IT HAS BEEN DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN
I ALWAYS MEANT YOU ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
IF I MAKE ONE JOURNEY I MUST MAKE MORE FOR THEN I HAVE NO EXCUSE
TIS TO BE HOPED BY THAT TIME MINE COME OVER THEY MAY BE OF FASHION AGAIN FOR TIS AN HUMOUR THAT YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE MR SMITH AND HIS LADY HAVE BROUGHT UP
WHEN THE CAPTAIN TOLD HIS ORDERS MENTIONING ALSO THAT HE HAD THE AMBASSADRESS ON BOARD
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A VERY PATHETIC ACCOUNT IN LORD LEICESTER'S JOURNAL OF HIS WIFE'S DEATH IN 1659 WHICH SHOWS THAT WHATEVER THIS DISORDER MAY HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE RECONCILIATION WAS AFTERWARDS EFFECTED
MY OLD ROMAN HEAD IS A PRESENT FOR A PRINCE
AND WHY IS TO SOME EXTREME BETTER THAN TO SOME EXTREMITY
YOU NEED NOT FEAR SUCH A COMMAND AS YOU MENTION
I HAD MUCH RATHER THEY SHOULD KNOW I CHOSE THE PERSON AND TOOK HIS FORTUNE BECAUSE TWAS NECESSARY AND THAT I PREFER A COMPETENCY WITH ONE I ESTEEM INFINITELY BEFORE A VAST ESTATE IN OTHER HANDS
THAT HE HAS ALL MY PRAYERS AND WISHES FOR HIS SAFETY
DID NOT YOU SAY ONCE YOU KNEW WHERE GOOD FRENCH TWEEZERS WERE TO BE HAD
WHEN I HAD OPENED THE LETTER I FOUND IN IT TWO RINGS
THEY TALKED BUT THE WEEK BEFORE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE MY LORD OF STRAFFORD
MY HUMOUR IS SO ILL AT PRESENT THAT I DARE SAY NO MORE LEST YOU CHIDE ME AGAIN
TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY HOWEVER THE WATERS GRADUALLY LOST THEIR REPUTATION
SHE'S HAPPIER BY MUCH THAN I SHALL EVER BE BUT I DO NOT ENVY HER
YOU HEAR THE NOISE MY LADY ANNE BLUNT HAS MADE WITH HER MARRYING
ONLY MY COUSIN MOLLE KEEPS HIS STILL
AT LEAST READ ONE STORY THAT I'LL MARK YOU DOWN IF YOU HAVE TIME FOR NO MORE
THIS ADDITION OF A LOCAL HABITATION AND A NAME GIVES US NO FURTHER KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER OF THE SCANDAL TO WHICH DOROTHY ALLUDES
ANOTHER FAULT I FIND TOO IN THE STYLE--'TIS AFFECTED
HE WAS EDUCATED AT EXETER COLLEGE OXFORD
AFTER THE RESTORATION HE WAS MADE LORD CHAMBERLAIN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND LORD PRIVY SEAL
BUT I DO NOT REPENT IT FOR I SHOULD NOT LOVE YOU IF I DID NOT THINK YOU DISCREET ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL MY KINDNESS
BESIDES THIS THERE IS NOTHING BUT THAT THE FRENCH KING GROWS VERY THRIFTY THAT ALL HIS BUILDINGS EXCEPT FORTIFICATIONS ARE CEASED AND THAT HIS PAYMENTS ARE NOT SO REGULAR AS THEY USED TO BE
ON MY CONSCIENCE I SHALL FOLLOW YOUR COUNSEL IF E'ER HE COMES AGAIN BUT I AM PERSUADED HE WILL NOT
THE DUTCH ADMIRAL VAN GHENT WAS PUZZLED
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU INSENSIBLE OF OUR MISFORTUNES BUT I WOULD NOT EITHER THAT YOU SHOULD REVENGE THEM ON YOURSELF
BETTER I HOPE THAN YOU DID THE LAST
AND I THINK I MAY WITHOUT VANITY SAY THAT NOBODY IS MORE SENSIBLE OF THE LEAST GOOD FORTUNE NOR MURMURS LESS AT AN ILL THAN I DO SINCE I OWE IT MERELY TO CUSTOM AND NOT TO ANY CONSTANCY IN MY HUMOUR OR SOMETHING THAT IS BETTER
I MEET SOME THERE SOMETIMES THAT LOOK VERY LIKE GENTLEMEN FOR TIS A ROAD AND WHEN THEY ARE IN GOOD HUMOUR THEY GIVE US A COMPLIMENT AS THEY GO BY
I HOPE YOU HAVE
YOUR MOST FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT
AND METHINKS TIS AS VAIN IN ME TO EXPECT IT AS TWOULD BE TO HOPE I MIGHT BE A QUEEN IF THAT WERE REALLY AS DESIRABLE A THING AS TIS THOUGHT TO BE
AND THOUGH YOU REPROACHED ME WITH UNKINDNESS FOR ADVISING YOU NOT TO REFUSE A GOOD OFFER YET I SHALL NOT BE DISCOURAGED FROM DOING IT AGAIN WHEN THERE IS OCCASION FOR I AM RESOLVED TO BE YOUR FRIEND WHETHER YOU WILL OR NO
OH TIS A MOST DISMAL DRESS,--I HAVE NOT DARED TO LOOK IN THE GLASS SINCE I WORE IT
SOME COMPANY THAT WAS HERE LAST NIGHT KEPT US UP TILL THREE O'CLOCK AND THEN WE LAY THREE IN A BED WHICH WAS ALL THE SAME TO ME AS IF WE HAD NOT GONE TO BED AT ALL
TWAS THE FIRST THING I LIKED IN YOU AND WITHOUT IT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LIKED ANYTHING
AND THAT IS SO MUCH YOUR FRIEND IT NEVER FURNISHES ME WITH ANYTHING TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE
TIS IN YOUR WAY TO THIS PLACE AND JUST BEFORE THE HOUSE
AND THE OSBORNES HAVE CEASED TO DWELL UNDER THE ANCIENT ROOF OF CHICKSANDS
I AM IN SUCH HASTE THAT I CAN SAY LITTLE ELSE TO YOU NOW
WHICH HE DOES WITH THE GREATER PLEASURE REMEMBERING THAT IT WAS THIS VERY PASSAGE THAT FIRST LED HIM TO READ THE LETTERS OF DOROTHY OSBORNE
IF POOR PRAZIMENE BE IN THE SAME DRESS I WOULD NOT SEE HER FOR THE WORLD
WE HEAR OF GREAT DISORDERS AT YOUR MASKS BUT NO PARTICULARS ONLY THEY SAY THE SPANISH GRAVITY WAS MUCH DISCOMPOSED
IF NEITHER WE MAY HOPE TO BE HAPPY AND THE SOONER FOR THIS JOURNEY
AFTER THIS SOME FRIENDS THAT HAD OBSERVED A GRAVITY IN MY FACE WHICH MIGHT BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN'S WIFE AS THEY TERM'D IT AND A MOTHER-IN-LAW PROPOSED A WIDOWER TO ME THAT HAD FOUR DAUGHTERS ALL OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY SISTERS
WALLER WRITES VERSES TO MRS BRAUGHTON SERVANT TO SACHARISSA COMMENCING HIS LINES FAIR FELLOW-SERVANT TEMPLE HAD HE WRITTEN VERSE TO HIS MISTRESS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LEFT US SOME LINES TO JANE THERE IS IN CAMPTON CHURCH A TABLET ERECTED TO DANIEL GOLDSMITH ECCLESIAE DE CAMPTON PASTOR IDEM ET PATRONUS ALSO TO MARIA GOLDSMITH UXOR DILECTISSIMA THIS IS ERECTED BY MARIA'S FAITHFUL SISTER JANE WRIGHT
MOST COMMONLY WHEN WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR DISCOURSE ONE LOOKS ABOUT HER AND SPIES HER COWS GOING INTO THE CORN AND THEN AWAY THEY ALL RUN AS IF THEY HAD WINGS AT THEIR HEELS
WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE THAT I HAD BUT THE WIT TO KNOW WHEN TO MAKE AN END OF MY LETTERS
IF I COULD FORGET YOU HE WOULD NOT HELP MY MEMORY
CLARENDON TELLS US THAT HE GOT INTO DEBT AND TO GET OUT OF DEBT FOUND HIMSELF IN CROMWELL'S COUNSEL
SURE THIS WILL AT LEAST DEFER YOUR JOURNEY
BUT WHEN HE HAD DRAWLED IT OUT THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A LETTER FOR ME IN HIS BAG I QUICKLY MADE HIM LEAVE HIS BROOM
TWAS THE VAINEST IMPERTINENT SELF-CONCEITED LEARNED COXCOMB THAT EVER YET I SAW
I WRIT MY BROTHER THAT STORY FOR WANT OF SOMETHING ELSE AND HE SAYS I DID VERY WELL THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO BE RID ON HIM
I SEE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY YOU IN THIS HOW I SHALL DISPOSE OF MYSELF FOR MY BROTHER IS NOT COME
AND THOUGH TIS LIKELY I SHOULD HAVE FORCED MYSELF TO SO MUCH COMPLIANCE AS WAS NECESSARY FOR A REASONABLE WIFE YET FARTHER THAN THAT NO DESIGN COULD EVER HAVE CARRIED ME
AND I HAVE MARKED THAT WHEN IT STOOD ALL NIGHT FOR THAT WAS MY DIRECTION THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL IT STOOD IN WOULD BE COVERED AN INCH THICK WITH A WHITE CLAY WHICH SURE HAS NO GREAT VIRTUE IN'T AND IS NOT VERY PLEASANT TO DRINK
INDEED THE NEXT DAY THEY WENT ALL TO LONDON
LETTER 42 SIR,--I AM EXTREMELY SORRY THAT YOUR LETTER MISCARRIED BUT I AM CONFIDENT MY BROTHER HAS IT NOT
TWAS WELL TIS A DULL FELLOW HE COULD NOT BUT HAVE DISCERN'D ELSE THAT I WAS STRANGELY OVERJOYED WITH IT AND EARNEST TO HAVE IT
THEY HAD SERVED YOU WELL ENOUGH IF THEY HAD CRAMMED A DOZEN OUNCES OF THAT MEDICINE DOWN YOUR THROAT TO HAVE MADE YOU REMEMBER A QUINZY
AND ON APRIL 18 1654 SHE PETITIONED THE PROTECTOR TO ISSUE A SPECIAL COMMISSION UPON HER WHOLE CASE
BUT WHAT BECOMES OF YOUNG COMPTON'S ESTATE
BUT TIS A SAD THING WHEN ALL ONE'S HAPPINESS IS ONLY THAT THE WORLD DOES NOT KNOW YOU ARE MISERABLE
HOW SHALL I APPREHEND A THOUSAND ACCIDENTS THAT ARE NOT LIKELY NOR WILL EVER HAPPEN I HOPE
IF HER NIECE HAS SO MUCH WIT WILL YOU NOT BE PERSUADED TO LIKE HER
BUT AS SHE WRITES TO HER SERVANT ONCE A WEEK AT LEAST SHE SEEMS TO HAVE CONSIDERED DATES TO BE SUPERFLUOUS
SHE IS SO MUCH A WOMAN THAT I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SAY I AM HER AUNT
HE WAS HERE AND BOTH HIS MEN WHEN THIS LETTER SHOULD HAVE COME AND NOT ONE OF THEM STIRRED OUT THAT DAY
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE GOT THUS FAR
I LENT IT MOST WILLINGLY AND GONE HE IS
LETTER 33._--SIR THOMAS PEYTON WE MUST REMEMBER HAD MARRIED DOROTHY'S ELDEST SISTER
ANNO DOMINI SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-THREE;--LET US LOOK ROUND THROUGH HISTORIC MIST FOR LANDMARKS SO THAT WE MAY KNOW OUR WHEREABOUTS
THEY SAY TIS TEN TIMES MORE EXTRAVAGANT THAN HER DRESS
AND TIS TO ME ONE OF THE PRETTIEST I HAVE READ AND THE MOST NATURAL
HIS TWO SONS SIR RICHARD AND SIR THOMAS MARRIED DAUGHTERS OF SIR LAVINIUS MUNCK;--SO WE NEED NOT ACCUSE DOROTHY OF IRRETRIEVABLY BREAKING HEARTS BY HER VARIOUS REFUSALS
WHY THEN SHOULD MY ABSENCE NOW BE LESS SUPPORTABLE TO YOU THAN HERETOFORE
CROMWELL WAS MEDITATING AN ABOLITION OF THE PARLIAMENT AND A PRACTICAL CORONATION OF HIMSELF
WITH ALL HIS QUARREL TO ME HE DOES NOT WISH ME SO ILL AS TO BE MARRIED TO THE PROUDEST IMPERIOUS INSULTING ILL-NATURED MAN THAT EVER WAS
THE THRICE NOBLE CHASTE AND VIRTUOUS BUT AGAIN SOMEWHAT FANTASTICAL AND ORIGINAL-BRAINED GENEROUS MARGARET NEWCASTLE AS ELIA DESCRIBES HER
TIS A MIRACLE TO ME HOW MY BROTHER ENDURES IT
BESIDES THAT TIS MY DUTY FROM WHICH NOTHING CAN EVER TEMPT ME NOR COULD YOU LIKE IT IN ME IF I SHOULD DO OTHERWISE TWOULD MAKE ME UNWORTHY OF YOUR ESTEEM
AND SURE MY OBEDIENCE DESERVES THEY SHOULD CURE ME OR ELSE THEY ARE GREAT TYRANTS TO VERY LITTLE PURPOSE
FOR SURE I SHOULD HAVE NOTHING THEN TO PERSUADE ME TO STAY LONGER WHERE THEY GROW AND I SHOULD QUICKLY TAKE A RESOLUTION OF LEAVING THEM AND THE WORLD AT ONCE
ARUNDEL HOWARD WAS HENRY SECOND SON OF THE EARL OF ARUNDEL
ON HIS RECALL TO ENGLAND HE ESPOUSED THE POPULAR CAUSE AND FOUGHT ON THAT SIDE IN THE BATTLE OF MARSTON MOOR
TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN DO
METHINKS YOUR VERY CHARITY SHOULD MAKE YOU LOVE ME MORE NOW THAN EVER BY SEEING ME SO MUCH MORE UNHAPPY THAN I USED BY BEING SO MUCH FARTHER FROM YOU FOR THAT IS ALL THE MEASURE CAN BE TAKEN OF MY GOOD OR ILL CONDITION
BUT TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES AND SILENCE MY REPROACHES THEY ALL AGREED TO SAY THAT I SPOILED THEIR JOLLITY BY WEARING THE MOST UNREASONABLE LOOKS THAT COULD BE PUT ON FOR SUCH AN OCCASION
HE IS NOW I THINK AT MY LORD PAGETT'S AT MARLOE MARLOW WHERE I AM PROMISED HE SHALL DRAW A PICTURE OF MY LADY FOR ME,--SHE GIVES IT ME SHE SAYS AS THE GREATEST TESTIMONY OF HER FRIENDSHIP TO ME FOR BY HER OWN RULE SHE IS PAST THE TIME OF HAVING PICTURES TAKEN OF HER
MY AUNT IS STILL IN TOWN KEPT BY HER BUSINESS WHICH I AM AFRAID WILL NOT GO WELL THEY DO SO DELAY IT
AND WHERE TIS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE WITHOUT GIVING AND RECEIVING INJURIES
ARE A THOUSAND WOMEN OR TEN THOUSAND WORLDS WORTH IT
WHAT A SIGH WAS THERE
MY MELANCHOLY HAS NO ANGER IN IT
IT WILL NOT BE AMISS THOUGH TO LET YOU SEE THAT WHAT I DID WAS MERELY IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR INTEREST AND NOT AT ALL OF MY OWN THAT YOU MAY JUDGE OF ME ACCORDINGLY
AND THOUGH I EASILY BELIEVE THAT TO MARRY ONE FOR WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY SOME AFFECTION WILL INFINITELY INCREASE THAT KINDNESS YET I SHALL NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT MARRIAGE HAS A CHARM TO RAISE LOVE OUT OF NOTHING MUCH LESS OUT OF DISLIKE
NOR OF THE NEXT SORT OF THEM WHOSE AIM REACHES NO FURTHER THAN TO BE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND ONCE IN HIS LIFE HIGH SHERIFF WHO READS NO BOOK BUT STATUTES AND STUDIES NOTHING BUT HOW TO MAKE A SPEECH INTERLARDED WITH LATIN THAT MAY AMAZE HIS DISAGREEING POOR NEIGHBOURS AND FRIGHT THEM RATHER THAN PERSUADE THEM INTO QUIETNESS
I TALKED MERRILY ON'T TILL I SAW MY BROTHER PUT ON HIS SOBER FACE AND COULD HARDLY THEN BELIEVE HE WAS IN EARNEST
HE DIED IN 1679
HOW DOROTHY BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
22 1653 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SIR T
I SHALL HAVE THEM AT LAST AND THEY WILL NOT BE THE LESS WELCOME
AT LENGTH HER MONEY ALL SPENT HER HEALTH BROKEN DOWN SHE RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND WAS LOST TO SIGHT
FOR YOUR MASTER SEAL WITH COAT-OF-ARMS WHEN YOUR MISTRESS PLEASES
ST GREGORY'S NEAR ST PAUL'S WAS A CHURCH ENTIRELY DESTROYED BY THE GREAT FIRE
TIS INDIFFERENT WHETHER THERE BE ANY WORD IN'T OR NOT
AND AS EARLY AS 1609 A BALL-ROOM WAS ERECTED AVENUES WERE PLANTED AND NEITHER BATH NOR TUNBRIDGE COULD RIVAL EPSOM IN THE SPLENDOUR OF THEIR APPOINTMENTS
TIS ALL SHE AIMS AT TO GO BEYOND EVERYBODY IN COMPLIMENT
INDEED THERE IS ONE PASSAGE ON LIKE AND DISLIKE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ONLY BY A MIND HABITUATED CAREFULLY TO REFLECT ON ITS OWN OPERATIONS AND WHICH REMINDS US OF THE BEST THINGS IN MONTAIGNE
NO NOR FOR A HUSBAND THAT I LOVED NEITHER
THAT HE SHOULD FILL THIS OFFICE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO HIM BY CROMWELL IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR
AND THERE IS A TALK AS IF THE CHANCERY WERE GOING DOWN
PEYTON'S LETTER NOTHING THAT IS PAPER CAN SCAPE ME WHEN I HAVE TIME TO WRITE AND TIS TO YOU
VAN GHENT HIMSELF THEN CAME ON BOARD WITH A HANDSOME COMPLIMENT TO LADY TEMPLE AND MAKING HIS PERSONAL INQUIRIES OF THE CAPTAIN RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER AS BEFORE
I SHALL TAKE HEED OF YOU HEREAFTER
FOR SURE WE WERE NOT MADE TO LIVE IN IT
FROM THAT TIME HE LIVED IN RETIREMENT IN LONDON UNTIL 1654 WHEN AS WE READ IN DOROTHY'S LETTERS HE AND HIS SON GO OVER TO IRELAND
IN HIM SAYS MACAULAY IN A SOMEWHAT HIGHLY-COLOURED CHARACTER-SKETCH THE POLITICAL IMMORTALITY OF HIS AGE WAS PERSONIFIED IN THE MOST LIVELY MANNER
AND WHAT HE KNEW OF ENGLAND IN THESE DAYS HE HAS LEFT IN PERHAPS THE GENTLEST AND MOST PEACEFUL VOLUME THE WORLD HAS EVER READ
THEY SAY TWILL BE TO NO PURPOSE
LETTER 38._--LADY ISABELLA IS LADY ISABELLA RICH MY LADY DIANA'S ELDEST SISTER
THEREFORE CONSIDER WHAT YOU DO TIS THE PART OF A FRIEND TO ADVISE YOU
AND I HAVE BEEN LESS AT HOME THAN ELSEWHERE EVER SINCE I CAME FROM LONDON
OF BOOKS PERHAPS THEY ARE
I SHALL IN A SHORT TIME HAVE DISENGAGED MYSELF OF ALL MY LITTLE AFFAIRS IN IT AND SETTLED MYSELF IN A CONDITION TO APPREHEND NOTHING BUT TOO LONG A LIFE THEREFORE I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET ME
YOU TOLD ME ONCE THAT OF ALL MY SERVANTS YOU LIKED HIM THE BEST
TOWARDS THE LATTER END IT WILL BE EXCELLENT STUFF I BELIEVE
AND YOU MAY SAFELY BELIEVE THAT I AM EQUALLY CONCERNED WITH YOU IN ANYTHING
YOU MAKE SO REASONABLE DEMANDS THAT TIS NOT FIT YOU SHOULD BE DENIED
I SHALL NEED IT
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HE TOLD US
I SEE YOU SPEAK WELL OF ME TO OTHER PEOPLE THOUGH YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS TO ME
ALMANZOR IS AS FRESH IN MY MEMORY AS IF I HAD VISITED HIS TOMB BUT YESTERDAY THOUGH IT BE AT LEAST SEVEN YEAR AGONE SINCE
SHE TAKES GREAT PAINS TO DISSUADE ME FROM EVER MARRYING AND SAYS I AM THE VERIEST FOOL THAT EVER LIVED IF I DO NOT TAKE HER COUNSEL
L'AMANT ABSENTE HAS IN MY OPINION A MISTRESS SO MUCH BEYOND ANY OF THE REST THAT TO BE IN DANGER OF LOSING HER IS MORE THAN TO HAVE LOST THE OTHERS
BUT WHILE I REMEMBER IT LET ME ASK YOU IF YOU DID NOT SEND MY LETTER AND CLEOPATRE WHERE I DIRECTED YOU FOR MY LADY
THE POOR FELLOW TOO WAS SO PLEASED THAT I UNDERTOOK TO INQUIRE OUT A PLACE FOR HIM THAT THOUGH MINE WAS AS I TOLD HIM UNCERTAIN YET UPON THE BARE HOPES ON'T HE REFUSED TWO OR THREE GOOD CONDITIONS
HIS HEAD WAS STRUCK OFF BEFORE THE GATE OF WESTMINSTER HALL ONE COLD MARCH MORNING IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND BY HIS SIDE DIED CAPEL AND THE DUKE OF HAMILTON
THIS TRACES THE LETTERS TO CODDENHAM VICARAGE
YOU MAY ALLOW ME TO MAKE EXCUSES TOO SOMETIMES
THE NOTE IN FRENCH IS SOMEWHAT OF A CURIOSITY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS QUAINT ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH IS PURPOSELY LEFT UNCORRECTED
TIS NOT THAT I HAVE LESS KINDNESS OR MORE COURAGE THAN YOU BUT THAT MISTRUSTING MYSELF MORE AS I HAVE MORE REASON I HAVE ARMED MYSELF ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE AGAINST THIS OCCASION
I LIKE HIM I'LL SWEAR AND EXTREMELY TOO FOR BEING SO CALM IN A BUSINESS WHERE HIS DESIRES WERE SO MUCH CROSSED
BUT YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND MY ELDER BROTHER I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU OF HIM
LETTER 21._--SIR THOMAS OSBORNE IS DOROTHY'S COUSIN OSBORNE HERE MENTIONED
YOU WILL BELIEVE I HAD NOT BEEN USED TO GREAT AFFLICTIONS WHEN I MADE HIS STORY SUCH A ONE TO ME AS I CRIED AN HOUR TOGETHER FOR HIM AND WAS SO ANGRY WITH ALCIDIANA THAT FOR MY LIFE I COULD NEVER LOVE HER AFTER IT
TELL ME OR I SHALL THINK YOU MADE IT TO EXCUSE YOURSELF
LETTER 37 SIR,--YOU SAY I ABUSE YOU
AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RID ON HIM QUICKLY IF HE HAD NOT THOUGHT HIMSELF A LITTLE TOO NEGLIGEE
AND WHERE THERE IS NO REASON TO UPHOLD A PASSION IT WILL SINK OF ITSELF
NO FOR GOD'S SAKE LET THERE BE NO SUCH THING BETWEEN US
THEY ARE TWO SISTERS AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN MINE IF THE FATES HAD SO PLEASED
THE CLUMP OF HOUSES WHICH STILL BEARS ITS NAME IS SUPPOSED TO INDICATE ITS POSITION WITH TOLERABLE EXACTNESS
THERE IS A NEW INTERCHANGE OF VOWS
AND AS SOMEBODY SAYS I KNOW NOT WHO MAJESTY IS NO ILL ORATOR BUT ALL WOULD NOT DO
SCORN AND DESPITE WOULD HAVE CURED ME IN SOME REASONABLE TIME WHICH I DESPAIR OF NOW
WHERE DID SHE AND JANE SPEND THEIR DAYS IF THAT WAS THE CASE WHEN REGENT STREET WAS GREEN FIELDS
HE LOVES HER I THINK AT THE ORDINARY RATE OF HUSBANDS BUT NOT ENOUGH I BELIEVE TO MARRY HER SO MUCH TO HIS DISADVANTAGE IF IT WERE TO DO AGAIN
TIS THE MOST TROUBLESOME BUSY TALKING LITTLE THING THAT EVER WAS BORN
THE LADY OF A LOBSTER IS A CURIOUS-SHAPED SUBSTANCE IN THE HEAD OF THAT FISH BEARING SOME DISTANT RESEMBLANCE TO THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN
IN MY OPINION TIS A FINE LADY BUT I KNOW YOU WILL PITY POOR AMESTRIS STRONGLY WHEN YOU HAVE READ HER STORY
SIR JOHN GRENVILE WAS A SON OF THE VALIANT AND LOYAL CAVALIER SIR BEVIL GRENVILE OF KELKHAMPTON CORNWALL
I GIVE YOU MANY THANKS FOR YOUR CARE OF MY IRISH DOG BUT I AM EXTREMELY OUT OF COUNTENANCE YOUR FATHER SHOULD BE TROUBLED WITH IT
I SAID TWAS TRUE BUT THAT WAS A RESPECT I SHOULD NOT AT ALL VALUE WHEN I OWED IT ONLY TO MY FORTUNE
I HAVE THE CHARITY TO BELIEVE THEY APPEAR VERY MUCH WORSE THAN THEY ARE AND THAT THE WANT OF A COURT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES BY IS IN GREAT PART THE CAUSE OF THEIR RUIN
NOW AT THIS INSTANT YOU SHOULD BE HERE
WHO SHALL NOW SAY WHAT ARE THE INMOST THOUGHTS OF OUR DOROTHY
SIR,--THERE IS NOTHING MOVES MY CHARITY LIKE GRATITUDE
THEY WEARY THEMSELVES AND ME TOO TO VERY LITTLE PURPOSE FOR TO MY THINKING THEY TALK THE MOST IMPERTINENTLY THAT EVER PEOPLE DID
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK I THINK OF MAKING ME READY AND WHEN THAT'S DONE I GO INTO MY FATHER'S CHAMBER FROM WHENCE TO DINNER WHERE MY COUSIN MOLLE AND I SIT IN GREAT STATE IN A ROOM AND AT A TABLE THAT WOULD HOLD A GREAT MANY MORE
AND AS SHE TELLS US SOMEWHERE HAD A SCORN OF TRANSLATIONS
IT IS DISCOVERED THAT THEIR DESIGN WAS TO HAVE DESTROYED HIS HIGHNESS'S PERSON AND ALL OTHERS AT THE HELM OF GOVERNMENT THAT THEY COULD HAVE LAID HANDS ON
HOW YOU ARE ALTERED
JANE PRESENTS HER HUMBLE SERVICE TO YOU AND HAS SENT YOU SOMETHING IN A BOX
SURE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OF ANYTHING IN THAT OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE EMPLOYED IT TO WRAP A BOOK UP
THE CELEBRATED SIR SAMUEL LUKE WAS A NEAR NEIGHBOUR OF THE OSBORNES AND MR LUKE WAS ONE OF HIS NUMEROUS FAMILY
AND TIS MOST CERTAIN THAT IF I WERE WITH YOU I SHOULD CHIDE NOTABLY
SPRANGE
SIR,--THIS IS TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO-MORROW MORNING ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK AT A LODGING OVER AGAINST THE PLACE WHERE CHARINGE CROSSE STOOD AND TWO DOORS ABOVE YE GOATE TAVERNE
FOR IF IT WERE SO I SHOULD NOT THINK THEY DID AND SO LONG YOU ARE SAFE
BUT I HOPE TIS NOT SO ILL AS SHE WOULD HAVE ME BELIEVE IT THOUGH I KNOW YOUR HUMOUR IS STRANGELY ALTERED FROM WHAT IT WAS AND AM SORRY TO SEE IT
AND AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN HE RETURNED TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND THERE KEPT A SCHOOL IN GREAT PENURY
YOUR FELLOW-SERVANT IS A SWEET JEWEL TO TELL TALES OF ME
AND TO ENCOURAGE YOU LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT THE MORE YOU READ OF THEM YOU WILL LIKE THEM STILL BETTER
SHE IS WRITING OF MR CHARLES RICH AND SAYS
WELL GIVE ME NO MORE OCCASIONS TO COMPLAIN OF YOU YOU KNOW NOT WHAT MAY FOLLOW
THE ENGAGEMENT SHE MENTIONS MUST HAVE BEEN ONE THAT HER PARENTS WERE FORCING UPON HER AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE LONDON VISIT I FANCY THAT HER FRIENDSHIP PROGRESSED BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL LIMITS
HER COMPANION JANE IS SICK
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT THEY BOTH FELL INTO SO VIOLENT A LAUGHING THAT I SHOULD APPEAR SO MUCH CONCERNED IN SUCH AN ART
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN NOTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT THAN DOROTHY TELLS US
DOROTHY HAS URGED TEMPLE TO GO TO IRELAND AND JOIN HIS FATHER WHO HAS ONCE AGAIN TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS OFFICE OF MASTER OF THE ROLLS
LETTER 2._--THIS LETTER WHICH IS DATED COMES I THINK AT SOME DISTANCE OF TIME FROM THE FIRST LETTER
WHEN YOU SEE YOUR FRIEND MR HENINGHAM YOU MAY TELL HIM IN HIS EAR THERE IS A WILLOW GARLAND COMING TOWARDS HIM
SIR BALDWIN SURRENDERED THE CASTLE TO BLAKE IN 1650
TO DEPEND UPON KINDRED THAT ARE NOT FRIENDS TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A BROTHER WHO IS HER LOVER'S AVOWED ENEMY THIS IS HER LOT IN LIFE UNLESS TEMPLE CAN RELEASE HER FROM IT
PROMISE ME THIS OR I SHALL HAUNT YOU WORSE THAN SHE DOES ME
TIS LIKE THE REST OF MY MEDICINES
THE GARDENS HAD BEEN LAID OUT BY THE COUNTESS OF BEDFORD WHO HAD SOLD THE PLACE IN 1626 TO THE EARL OF PEMBROKE
BUT THE HUMOUR MAKES THE BEST PART OF IT
WHAT IS IT YOUR FATHER AILS AND HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN ILL
WHILST I READ THE DESCRIPTION ON'T I COULD NOT BELIEVE BUT THAT I HAD WRIT IT MYSELF IT WAS SO MUCH MY OWN
THIS WAS NOT THE BEAUTY THAT HAD ATTRACTED HER LOVER AND HELD HIM ENCHAINED IN HER SERVICE FOR SEVEN YEARS OF WAITING AND SUSPENSE
YOU ASK COUNSEL OF A PERSON THAT IS VERY LITTLE ABLE TO GIVE IT
I HAVE ALREADY REPENTED ALL MY SHARE IN YOUR JOURNEY AND BEGIN TO FIND I AM NOT HALF SO VALIANT AS I SOMETIMES TAKE MYSELF TO BE
BESIDES ALL THAT IS DUE TO NATURE AND THE MEMORY OF MANY MORE THAN ORDINARY KINDNESSES RECEIVED FROM HIM BESIDES WHAT HE WAS TO ALL THAT KNEW HIM AND WHAT HE WAS TO ME IN PARTICULAR I AM LEFT BY HIS DEATH IN THE CONDITION WHICH OF ALL OTHERS IS THE MOST UNSUPPORTABLE TO MY NATURE TO DEPEND UPON KINDRED THAT ARE NOT FRIENDS AND THAT THOUGH I PAY AS MUCH AS I SHOULD DO TO A STRANGER YET THINK THEY DO ME A COURTESY
HE PUBLISHED SOME POLITICAL TRACTS NONE OF WHICH ARE NOW IN EXISTENCE
FOR GOD'S SAKE BE IN BETTER HUMOUR AND ASSURE YOURSELF I AM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WISH YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT
I SHALL TAKE HEED THOUGH HEREAFTER WHAT I WRITE SINCE YOU ARE SO GOOD AT RAISING DOUBTS TO PERSECUTE YOURSELF WITHAL AND SHALL CONDEMN MY OWN EASY FAITH NO MORE
WHEN I WAS YOUNG AS YOU ARE I THOUGHT MY FATHER-IN-LAW WHO WAS A WISE MAN THE MOST UNREASONABLY SUSPICIOUS MAN THAT EVER WAS AND DISLIKED HIM FOR IT HUGELY
AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH SHE RETIRED TO BRINGTON IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE UNTIL WEARIED WITH THE HEAVY LOAD OF HOUSEKEEPING SHE CAME TO LIVE WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER AT PENSHURST
OR IF WE MAY NOT HAVE THESE IN PURITAN DAYS AT LEAST WE MAY HEAR THE POMPOUS MAGISTRATE PRONOUNCE THE BLESSING OF THE STATE OVER ITS TWO HAPPY SUBJECTS
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT HE THAT DEMANDS L5000 BESIDES THE REVERSION OF AN ESTATE WILL LIKE BARE L4000
TO ALL THIS I MAKE NO REPLY BUT THAT IF THEY WILL NEEDS HAVE IT THAT I AM NOT WITHOUT KINDNESS FOR YOU THEY MUST CONCLUDE WITHAL THAT TIS NO PART OF MY INTENTION TO RUIN YOU AND SO THE CONFERENCE BREAKS UP FOR THAT TIME
FROM PARIS THEY WENT TO ROTTERDAM SHE LEAVING THE QUEEN TO FOLLOW HER HUSBAND'S FORTUNES
FOR GOD'S SAKE WRITE CONSTANTLY WHILE I AM HERE OR I AM UNDONE PAST ALL RECOVERY
FOR TO SAY TRUTH I HAVE NOT TIME TO MAKE THIS LONGER
HE HAS MET WITH A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD COMPANY I BELIEVE
IF MR D HAD NOT BEEN SO NICE IN DISCOVERING HIS NAME YOU WOULD QUICKLY HAVE BEEN CURED OF YOUR JEALOUSY
MR COURTENAY EXPRESSES SOME DOUBT WHETHER HIS READERS WILL THINK HIM JUSTIFIED IN INSERTING SO LARGE A NUMBER OF THESE EPISTLES
HE WENT FROM LONDON INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE TO MY SISTER WHO WAS VERY ILL AND HIS YOUNGEST GIRL OF WHICH HE WAS VERY FOND IS SINCE DEAD
I WONDER HOW YOUR FATHER CAME TO KNOW I WAS IN TOWN UNLESS MY OLD FRIEND YOUR COUSIN HAMMOND SHOULD TELL HIM
METHINKS IT SHOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR AN HEIR
LETTER 28._--DOROTHY'S ALLUSION TO THE SEVEN SLEEPERS REFERS TO A STORY WHICH OCCURS IN THE GOLDEN LEGEND AND OTHER PLACES OF SEVEN NOBLE YOUTHS OF EPHESUS WHO FLED FROM PERSECUTION TO A CAVE IN MOUNT CELION
MY COUSIN MOLLE I THINK MEANS TO END THE SUMMER THERE
BUT TIS NO WONDER NEITHER THAT I DID NOT SEE HIM FOR I SAW NOT YOU WHEN I MET YOU THERE
DEAR NEPHEW,--I GIVE YOU MANY THANKS FOR YOUR KIND LETTER AND THE SENSE YOU HAVE OF MY AFFLICTION WHICH TRULY IS VERY GREAT
AND ALL THIS DONE WITH SO MUCH CEREMONY AND COMPLIMENT SO MANY PARDONS ASKED FOR UNDERTAKING TO COUNSEL OR INQUIRE AND SO GREAT KINDNESS AND PASSION FOR ALL MY INTERESTS PROFESSED THAT I CANNOT BUT TAKE IT WELL THOUGH I AM VERY WEARY ON'T
IT MUST NOT BE AT ALL WIDER THAN THIS WHICH IS RATHER TOO BIG FOR ME THAN OTHERWISE
IT IS TAKEN FROM COURTENAY'S LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE VOL
I AM OF HER OPINION IN MOST THINGS THAT SHE SAYS IN HER CHARACTER OF L'HONNEST HOMME THAT SHE IS IN SEARCH OF AND HER RESOLUTION OF RECEIVING NO HEART THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED TO ANYBODY ELSE
THOSE WHO HAVE JOLTED OVER THE FROZEN RUTS OF A FEN ROAD BEHIND THEIR COMFORTABLE FLEMISH HORSES AND HEARD THE GOSSIP OF THE FARMERS AND THEIR WIVES THE GRUNTS OF THE DISCONTENTED BAGGAGE PIG AND THE ENCOURAGING SHOUTS OF THE CARRIER
CAN YOU DOUBT THAT ANYTHING CAN MAKE YOUR LETTERS CHEAP
AND WITH A CERTAIN INEXTINGUISHABLE CRUBESCENCE STILL IN THE ABYSSES OF THE DEAD DEEP NIGHT
THERE IS MR STANLEY AND MRS WITHERINGTON
BUT IN EARNEST I SHALL BE SO POSSESSED WITH A STRONG SPLENETIC FANCY THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU MORE IN THIS WORLD AS ALL THE WATERS IN ENGLAND WILL NOT CURE
BUT IN EARNEST IT WAS NOT THAT I AIMED AT I ONLY DESIRED TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO OBLIGE YOU
BUT TO HAVE THE SPLEEN AND TO DREAM UPON'T IS A PUNISHMENT I WOULD NOT WISH MY GREATEST ENEMY
HE HAS OFTEN INQUIRED AFTER ME TO HEAR IF I WERE MARRYING AND SOMEBODY TOLD HIM I HAD AN AGUE AND HE PRESENTLY FELL SICK OF ONE TOO SO NATURAL A SYMPATHY THERE IS BETWEEN US
LETTER 31._--DOROTHY IS IN MOURNING FOR HER YOUNGEST BROTHER ROBERT WHO DIED ABOUT THIS TIME
I AM IN PERFECT CHARITY WITH MY ENEMIES AND HAVE COMPASSION FOR ALL PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNES AS WELL AS FOR MY OWN ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE I MAY HAVE CAUSED
YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IF YOU THINK IT WOULD PREVAIL UPON ME TO ALTER MY INTENTIONS
PETER THE ELDEST DOROTHY'S FATHER WHO SUCCEEDED HIM IN HIS HEREDITARY OFFICE OF TREASURER'S REMEMBRANCER
BESIDES THAT UPON IT HE GOT MY BROTHER'S CUSTOM
THE DESPONDENCY HAS BEEN AGONIZING BUT THE AGONY IS SHARP AND RAPID AND GIVES PLACE TO THE WISDOM OF HOPE
IF IT BE NECESSARY I WILL CONFESS ALL THIS AND SOMETHING MORE WHICH IS THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL MY GALLANTRY AND RESOLUTION TIS MUCH FOR MY CREDIT THAT MY COURAGE IS PUT TO NO GREATER A TRIAL THAN PARTING WITH YOU AT THIS DISTANCE
SHE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN HANDSOME
I WAS UPON MY GUARD AND SUSPECTING ALL HE SAID EXAMINED HIM SO STRICTLY WHERE HE HAD IT BEFORE I WOULD OPEN IT THAT HE WAS HUGELY CONFOUNDED AND I CONFIRMED THAT TWAS HIS
YOU WOULD LAUGH SURE IF I COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY SERVANTS HE HAS OFFERED ME SINCE HE CAME DOWN
WHICH METHOUGHT WAS THE PRETTIEST FANCY AND HAD THE LEAST OF SENSE IN IT OF ANY I HAD HEARD ON CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS NO ADDITION TO HER PERSON THAT HE HAD HONOUR ENOUGH BEFORE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HOW LITTLE IT IS ESTEEMED IN THIS AGE,--IF IT BE ANYTHING IN A BETTER,--WHICH FOR MY PART I AM NOT WELL SATISFIED IN
YET ON MY CONSCIENCE HE IS A GREATER TO HIMSELF AND I DEAL WITH SO MUCH FRANCHISE AS TO TELL HIM SO
NAY IT SHALL NOT BE LONG IF I CAN HELP IT AND I SHALL BREAK THROUGH ALL INCONVENIENCES RATHER THAN DENY YOU ANYTHING THAT LIES IN MY POWER TO GRANT
LADY SUNDERLAND WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF LEICESTER AND SISTER OF ALGERNON SYDNEY
WHICH SURE WILL BE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I CAN SINCE TIS EQUALLY DESIRED BY YOU AND YOUR FAITHFUL
SIR,--YOUR LAST LETTER CAME LIKE A PARDON TO ONE UPON THE BLOCK
HE WILL HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO SAY WHEN MY LORD MY FATHER IS TAKEN FROM HIM
HE PUBLISHED AMONG OTHER THINGS AN HISTORICAL RELATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES A HISTORY OF THE WARS IN FLANDERS AND A HISTORY OF VENICE
YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK I AM IN DEBT FOR BOTH THESE DAYS
BUT I MUST CONFESS TWAS NOT FOR THAT FOR I DID NOT KNOW IT THEN BUT GOING TO MEET HIM AS I USUALLY DO WHEN HE GAVE ME YOUR LETTER I FOUND THE UPPER SEAL BROKEN OPEN AND UNDERNEATH WHERE IT USES TO BE ONLY CLOSED WITH A LITTLE WAX THERE WAS A SEAL WHICH THOUGH IT WERE AN ANCHOR AND A HEART METHOUGHT IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE YOURS BUT LESS AND MUCH WORSE CUT
IN EARNEST I SHALL BE QUITE SPOILED
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SAW ME
BUT I ADMIRE YOUR FATHER'S PATIENCE THAT LETS YOU REST WITH SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE WHEN THERE IS SUCH A FORTUNE OFFERED
PRAY GIVE IT HIM TO MEND
SHE MARRIED THE ELECTOR FREDERICK WHO WAS DRIVEN FROM HIS THRONE OWING TO HIS OWN MISCONDUCT AND FOLLY WHEN HIS WIFE WAS FORCED TO RETURN AND LIVE AS A PENSIONER IN HER NATIVE COUNTRY
OTHER PEOPLE MAKE IT SO MUCH THEIR BUSINESS TO GAPE THAT I'LL SWEAR THEY PUT ME SO OUT OF COUNTENANCE I DARE NOT LOOK UP FOR MY LIFE
SHE HAD LIVED FOR SOME TIME PAST WITH MONK AND UNITED TO THE INFLUENCE OF HABIT AN IMPETUOSITY OF WILL AND WORDS DIFFICULT TO BE RESISTED BY THE TRANQUIL APATHY OF HER LOVER
HIS MIND HAD UNDERGONE A TRAINING BY WHICH ALL HIS VICES HAD BEEN NURSED UP TO THE RANKEST MATURITY LADY LEXINGTON WAS MARY DAUGHTER OF SIR ANTHONY LEGER
I AM IN NO HASTE FOR IT AND SO HE DOES IT WELL WE WILL NOT FALL OUT
NOW LET US REMEMBER OUR FRIENDS THOSE WHOM WE LOVE ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE FOR US AND BEQUEATHED TO US THROUGH WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED TO KNOW THEM
TO SEE HIM WHOLLY TAKEN UP WITH RUNNING ON ERRANDS FOR HIS WIFE AND TEACHING HER LITTLE DOG TRICKS
TWAS SURE BY CHANCE
IN EARNEST IT TRANSPORTED ME SO THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR EXPRESSING MY JOY IN SUCH A MANNER AS HAD ANYBODY BEEN BY TO HAVE OBSERVED ME THEY WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED ME NO VERY SOBER PERSON
SMITH AND THE PLACE BEING FULL OF COMPANY HE PROBABLY ENJOYED HIMSELF VASTLY
DOROTHY SEEMS TO THINK HARROLD DELIVERED THE LETTER AND IT WAS MISLAID IN LONDON
ONLY TIS LIKELY NAN MAY TELL YOU WHEN HE IS THERE
HE IS NOT ABLE TO FORBEAR SHOWING IT NOW WHEN MY CONDITION DESERVES PITY FROM ALL THE WORLD I THINK AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS NEWLY LOST A FATHER AS WELL AS I
THERE ARE STILL CLOISTERS ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT MAYBE
IF I CAN SEE YOU THIS MORNING I WILL BUT I DARE NOT PROMISE IT
AND WITH MORE DISADVANTAGE THAN ANYBODY ELSE WOULD
I'LL KEEP HER IN CHAINS BEFORE SHE SHALL QUIT SCORES WITH ME
I HAVE HEARD INDEED THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY
CLEOPATRE AND LE GRAND CYRUS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DOROTHY'S LITERARY COMPANIONS AT THIS DATE
BY HIM SOLD IN ELIZABETH'S REIGN TO SIR JOHN OSBORNE KNT THUS BECOMING THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF OUR DOROTHY
OUR READERS PROBABLY REMEMBER WHAT MRS HUTCHINSON TELLS US OF HERSELF
BUT I SHALL SET HIM NOW AT LIBERTY AND NOT THINK AT ALL THE WORSE OF HIM FOR HIS GOOD-NATURE
IF PEOPLE PROCEEDED WITH THIS CAUTION THE WORLD WOULD END SOONER THAN IS EXPECTED I BELIEVE
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I WENT FOR
BUT HE HAD THE GOOD TASTE AND DISCERNMENT TO ADMIRE THIS LETTER AND QUOTE FROM IT IN HIS ESSAY ON SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE,--A QUOTATION FOR WHICH I SHALL ALWAYS REMAIN VERY GRATEFUL TO HIM
BUT SURE THIS IS MORE THAN I NEED TO SAY
YOU WOULD KNOW IT TO BE WRIT BY A PERSON OF GOOD QUALITY THOUGH YOU WERE NOT TOLD IT
PERHAPS HE DID NOT THINK IT CONVENIENT TO PUT ME IN MIND OF YOU
YET NOW I REMEMBER
IN EARNEST I WAS STRANGELY VEXED TO SEE MYSELF FORCED TO DISAPPOINT YOU SO AND FELT YOUR TROUBLE AND MY OWN TOO
IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKE IT WITH YOU TIS AS DIVERTING A BOOK OF THE KIND AS EVER I READ AND IS AS HANDSOMELY WRITTEN
LIKE A GENTLEMAN I KNOW WHO WOULD NEVER SAY THE WEATHER GREW COLD BUT THAT WINTER BEGAN TO SALUTE US I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR SUCH COXCOMBS AND CANNOT BLAME AN OLD UNCLE OF MINE THAT THREW THE STANDISH AT HIS MAN'S HEAD BECAUSE HE WRIT A LETTER FOR HIM WHERE INSTEAD OF SAYING AS HIS MASTER BID HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE WRIT HIMSELF BUT HE HAD THE GOUT IN HIS HAND HE SAID THAT THE GOUT IN HIS HAND WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO PUT PEN TO PAPER THE FELLOW THOUGHT HE HAD MENDED IT MIGHTILY AND THAT PUTTING PEN TO PAPER WAS MUCH BETTER THAN PLAIN WRITING
WELL TIS A PLEASANT WORLD THIS
BUT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE I MAY TALK IGNORANTLY OF MARRIAGE
LORD BROGHILL IS WELL KNOWN TO THE HISTORY OF THAT TIME BOTH LITERARY AND POLITICAL
IN EARNEST I AM NO MORE CONCERNED WHETHER PEOPLE THINK ME HANDSOME OR ILL-FAVOURED WHETHER THEY THINK I HAVE WIT OR THAT I HAVE NONE THAN I AM WHETHER THEY THINK MY NAME ELIZABETH OR DOROTHY
BUT WHENSOEVER SHE SHALL THINK FIT TO SERVE AGAIN AND IS NOT PROVIDED OF A BETTER MISTRESS SHE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND ME
THERE IS AN AMUSING SCANDALOUS TRACT CALLED THE LIFE AND DEATH OF STEPHEN MARSHALL WHICH IS SO FULL OF EVIL SPEAKING LYING AND SLANDERING AS TO BE QUITE UNWORTHY OF QUOTATION
I HAVE ANOTHER FAULT TO CHIDE YOU FOR
BUT YESTERDAY THOUGH I RIS WITH GOOD INTENTIONS OF GOING TO CHURCH MY COLD WOULD NOT SUFFER ME BUT KEPT ME PRISONER ALL THE DAY
WHEN SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY FOR HERSELF SHE TOLD HER SHE HAD RATHER BEG WITH MR HOWARD THAN LIVE IN THE GREATEST PLENTY THAT COULD BE WITH EITHER MY LORD BROGHILL CHARLES RICH OR MR NEVILE,--FOR ALL THESE WERE DYING FOR HER THEN
IN THE SIXTEENTH YEAR OF HIS AGE HE WAS GREATLY TROUBLED WITH DREAMS CONCERNING HIS DAMNATION OR SALVATION
THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM SEVERAL EARTHEN JARS STUFFED WITH GUNPOWDER STOPPED WITH WAX AND FITTED WITH MATCHES INTENDING IT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE SOME MISCHIEF TO THE EXCHANGE THAT THEY MIGHT COMPLETE THEIR REVENGE BUT THEY WERE PREVENTED THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR TRIAL IN THE STATE TRIALS OF SOME INTEREST TO LAWYERS
THIS RISING LIKE SIR THOMAS PEYTON'S MISCARRIED AND HE SUFFERED DEFEAT AT KINGSTON-ON-THAMES ON JULY 7TH OF THAT YEAR
WOULD IT BE BETTER IF I HAD LOST YOU OR YOU ME
KNOWLTON SEPT
I WAS LOOKING T'OTHER DAY IN A BOOK OF HIS WHERE HE TRANSLATES PIPERO AS PIPER AND TWENTY WORDS MORE THAT ARE AS FALSE AS THIS
AND THESE LETTERS ARE VERY SERIOUS IN THEIR SADNESS IMPRINTING THEMSELVES IN THE MIND AFTER CONSTANT READING AS LANDMARKS CLEARLY DEFINING THE COURSE AND PROGRESS OF AN UNUSUAL EVENT IN THESE LOVERS HISTORY--A MISUNDERSTANDING
BUT TIS WELL WHERE IT IS AND I SHOULD SOONER WISH YOU MORE ON'T THAN LESS
THE REST WAS MUCH AT THIS RATE INTERLARDED WITH THE PRETTIEST ODD PHRASES THAT I HAD THE MOST ADO TO LOOK SOBERLY ENOUGH FOR THE PLACE I WAS IN THAT EVER I HAD IN MY LIFE
I HAVE HAD SO LITTLE SLEEP SINCE MY FATHER WAS SICK THAT I AM NEVER THOROUGHLY AWAKE
REMEMBER MY FELLOW-SERVANT
BUT WHEN I HAVE HIS LEAVE I GO INTO SUFFOLK FOR A MONTH AND THEN COME HITHER AGAIN TO GO INTO KENT WHERE I INTEND TO BURY MYSELF ALIVE AGAIN AS I DID IN BEDFORDSHIRE UNLESS YOU CALL ME OUT AND TELL ME I MAY BE HAPPY
DOES SHE NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR US WHEN SHE WRITES THAT HE WAS THE GREATEST NOBLEMAN IN ENGLAND
IT MUST SUPPOSE ONE TO BE A DEVIL IN HUMAN SHAPE
NATURE HAD GIVEN HIM A KEEN UNDERSTANDING A RESTLESS AND MISCHIEVOUS TEMPER A COLD HEART AND AN ABJECT SPIRIT
BUT I SHALL LEAVE HIM TO-NIGHT TO ENTERTAIN HIMSELF AND TRY IF I CAN WRITE AS WISELY AS I TALK
LEAVE ME TO THIS AND SEEK A BETTER FORTUNE
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEATEN HIM MYSELF IF I HAD BEEN ABLE
TO THIS MOST SEVERE TRIAL THE AFFECTION AND HONOUR OF THE LOVERS OF THAT AGE WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY SUBJECTED
AS FOR TEMPLE HE HAS NOT ALTOGETHER ESCAPED THE CENSURE OF THE ORTHODOX
NOR MINE NE'ER THOUGHT IT
MY LADY ANNE WENTWORTH I HEAR IS MARRYING BUT I CANNOT LEARN TO WHOM
HE WAS CAPTAIN UNDER HARRISON IN 1647
THE FIRST WAS UNDOUBTEDLY DONE BUT WE DOUBT IF THERE WAS EVER ANY LONG-CONTINUED EFFORT TO DO THE LAST
HOWEVER I AM NOT DISPLEASED WITH IT AND IF IT MAY BE OF ANY ADVANTAGE TO YOU I SHALL NOT CONSIDER MYSELF IN IT
TWILL BE NONE TO YOU I HOPE TO PRAY FOR YOU NOR TO DESIRE THAT YOU WOULD ALL PASSION LAID ASIDE FREELY TELL ME MY FAULTS THAT I MAY AT LEAST ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS WHERE TIS NOT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU BETTER SATISFACTION
BUT WITHAL HE TOLD ME HE WOULD NEVER GIVE ME OCCASION OF ANY DISCONTENT WHICH HE COULD REMEDY
THINK ON'T AND ATTEMPT IT AT LEAST
TWAS UNKINDLY SAID TO TELL ME I BANISH YOU
AND THOUGH I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT SHOWS AN UNPRACTISEDNESS IN THE WORLD AND BETRAYS TO ALL THAT UNDERSTAND IT BETTER YET SINCE IT IS A QUALITY I WAS NOT BORN WITH NOR EVER LIKE TO GET I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT GOOD TO MAINTAIN THAT TWAS BETTER NOT TO NEED IT THAN TO HAVE IT
AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS TOO AS LOST AND AS WRETCHED AS I AM I HAVE STILL SOME SENSE OF MY REPUTATION LEFT IN ME,--I FIND THAT TO MY COST,--I SHALL ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE IT AS CLEAR AS I CAN
TO THESE HE RETIRED DISAPPOINTED IN SPIRIT FEEBLE IN HEALTH SOON TO BE BEREFT OF THE COMPANY OF HIS WIFE WHO DIED TOWARDS THE END OF 1650 AND BUT FOR THE CONSTANT MINISTERING OF HIS DAUGHTER DOROTHY LIVING LONELY AND FORGOTTEN TO SEE THE CAUSE FOR WHICH HE HAD FOUGHT DISCREDITED AND DEAD
I WOULD HAVE YOU DIVERTED WHILST YOU ARE THERE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
IF YOU'LL ADVISE ME TO IT I'LL VENTURE
YOU ASK MY THOUGHTS BUT AT ONE HOUR
TWAS A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT YOU MISSED THOSE FAIR WINDS
LADY ORMOND WAS THE WIFE OF THE FIRST DUKE OF ORMOND
AND I HIM SO ILL THAT I VOWED IF I HAD L1000 LESS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT TOO MUCH FOR HIM
HAVE NOT I TAUGHT HER WELL SHE WRITES BETTER THAN HER MISTRESS
BUT AS MUCH A STRANGER AS I AM TO HIM I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT VERY ILL IF I HAD DESIRED IT OF HIM AND HE HAD REFUSED IT ME
A LADY WHOSE FACE I NEVER SAW SENT IT ME AS NEWS SHE HAD OUT OF IRELAND
AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF SAYING I WOULD BE SURE TO TAKE THE FIRST OCCASION AND THAT I WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE FOR IT BECAUSE I HOPED YOU HAD BELIEVED ALL THAT ALREADY
MAYO WHO VERY GALLANTLY DEFENDING HIMSELF RECEIVED SEVEN DANGEROUS WOUNDS AND LIES IN A MORTAL CONDITION
HOW I SHOULD LOVE THAT PLAIN-HEARTEDNESS YOU SPEAK OF IF YOU WOULD USE IT
ONE WAS AS I REMEMBER AN EMERALD DOUBLET BUT BROKEN IN THE CARRIAGE I SUPPOSE AS IT MIGHT WELL BE COMING SO FAR
BESIDES I MAY OWN MY ILL-HUMOUR TO YOU THAT CAUSE IT
IT WAS BUT MY GUESS THAT THE LADIES AT HEAMS WERE UNHANDSOME
TWILL BE PLEASINGER TO YOU I AM SURE TO TELL YOU HOW FOND I AM OF YOUR LOCK
VENT IT ALL UPON ME
NOW HE WAS PAINTING CROMWELL
HERE IS A SEAL WHICH PRAY GIVE WALKER TO SET FOR ME VERY HANDSOMELY AND NOT OF ANY OF THOSE FASHIONS HE MADE MY OTHERS BUT OF SOMETHING THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE REST
I WILL PRAY AND WISH AND HOPE BUT YOU MUST DO SO TOO THEN AND BE SO CAREFUL OF YOURSELF THAT I MAY HAVE NOTHING TO REPROACH YOU WITH WHEN YOU COME BACK
OF LADY SUNDERLAND AND MR SMITH WE HAVE ALREADY SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE
BAPTIST NOEL VISCOUNT CAMDEN WAS A NOTED LOYALIST
AND SO HIGH INDEED THAT SHOULD I EVER FALL TWOULD DASH ME ALL TO PIECES
HAS SHE BEEN RECENTLY READING THIS PASSAGE
AND YET I BELIEVE HE DESCENDED AS LOW AS HE COULD TO COME NEAR MY WEAK UNDERSTANDING
NOBODY CAN HINDER US NOR IS IT IN ITSELF TO BE BLAMED
AND SURE IF ANYTHING OF THAT KIND CAN DESERVE IT HER MISFORTUNES MAY
BUT I HAVE DONE AND AM NOW AT LEISURE TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS THAT DAUGHTER OF MY LORD OF HOLLAND WHO MAKES AS YOU SAY SO MANY SORE EYES WITH LOOKING ON HER THAT IS HERE
THE NARRATIVE OF HIS DEFENCE OF CASTLE CORNET FOR THE KING EMBODIED IN HIS OWN LETTERS IN THE LETTERS AND PAPERS OF GEORGE CARTERET GOVERNOR OF JERSEY IN THE DETAILED ACCOUNT LEFT BEHIND BY A NATIVE OF GUERNSEY AND IN THE STATE PAPERS OF THE PERIOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING EPISODES IN AN EPOCH OF EPISODES
WHY WOULD NOT YOUR OWN RESOLUTION WORK AS MUCH UPON YOU AS NECESSITY AND TIME DOES INFALLIBLY UPON PEOPLE
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLIKE HIS FATHER
SURE IF IT HAD BEEN ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT MY LORD L
AND IT IS JUST IT SHOULD BE SO
HER HUSBAND LIVES THERE TOO BUT I AM AFRAID IN NO VERY GOOD CONDITION
I AM VERY CONFIDENT IT WAS DELIVERED AND THEREFORE YOU MUST SEARCH WHERE THE FAULT LIES
NO IF I HAD GONE IT HAD BEEN TO HAVE WAITED ON MY NEIGHBOUR WHO HAS NOW ALTERED HER RESOLUTION AND GOES NOT HERSELF
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THIS VERY PHRASE HAS COMPLETELY PUZZLED DR GROSART THE LEARNED EDITOR OF HERRICK WHO CONFESSES THAT HE CAN MAKE NOTHING OF THE ALLUSION IN THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM THE FAIRIE TEMPLE THE SAINT TO WHICH THE MOST HE PRAYES AND OFFERS INCENSE NIGHTS AND DAYES THE LADY OF THE LOBSTER IS WHOSE FOOT-PACE HE DOTH STROAK AND KISS SWIFT TOO USES THE PHRASE IN HIS BATTLE OF THE BOOKS IN DESCRIBING THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN VIRGIL AND DRYDEN WHERE HE SAYS THE HELMET WAS NINE TIMES TOO LARGE FOR THE HEAD WHICH APPEARED SITUATE FAR IN THE HINDER PART EVEN LIKE THE LADY IN A LOBSTER OR A MOUSE UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE OR LIKE A SHRIVELLED BEAU FROM WITHIN THE PENTHOUSE OF A MODERN PERIWIG SIR,--I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANYBODY HAS FRIGHTED ME OR BEATEN ME OR PUT ME INTO MORE PASSION THAN WHAT I USUALLY CARRY ABOUT ME BUT YESTERDAY I MISSED MY FIT AND AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE I SHALL HEAR NO MORE ON'T
MY LADY BRIDGET OSBORNE MAKES A WORSE NAME A GREAT DEAL METHINKS THAN PLAIN MY LADY OSBORNE WOULD DO
THE EPSOM SPRING HAD BEEN DISCOVERED EARLIER IN THE CENTURY
TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL HAVE ME DO
IN EARNEST I BELIEVE THERE IS NOBODY DISPLEASED THAT PEOPLE SPEAK WELL OF THEM AND REPUTATION IS ESTEEMED BY ALL OF MUCH GREATER VALUE THAN LIFE ITSELF
HE PURCHASED MOOR PARK HERTFORDSHIRE ABOUT THIS TIME
YOU COULD NOT BUT HAVE LAUGHED IF YOU HAD SEEN ME LAST NIGHT
AS IT IS INFINITELY ABOVE WHAT I CAN DESERVE AND MORE THAN GOD ALMIGHTY USUALLY ALLOTS TO THE BEST PEOPLE I CAN FIND NOTHING IN REASON BUT SEEMS TO BE AGAINST ME
TIS BECAUSE THE STORY PLEASES ME--NONE IN OVID SO MUCH
SUCH AS WERE REALLY DISCREET AS THEY SEEMED TO BE GAVE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE EMINENCY OF THEIR CONDITION MADE OTHERS STRIVE TO IMITATE THEM OR AT LEAST THEY DURST NOT OWN A CONTRARY COURSE
JULY 20TH 1654 IN PENCIL I AM VERY SORRY I SPOKE TOO LATE FOR I AM CONFIDENT THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
YET I KNOW SO MUCH,--THAT MY LADY CARLISLE WOULD TAKE IT VERY ILL IF YOU SHOULD NOT LET HER GET THE POINT OF HONOUR
SPENCER IS A SERVANT TO A LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE A DAUGHTER OF MY LADY LEXINGTON'S
HOWEVER TIS NOT AMISS THAT MY WILL MADE YOU KNOW NOW HOW TO DISPOSE OF ALL MY WEALTH WHENSOEVER I DIE
I HAD NO PATIENCE FOR THIS
YOU MUST BE CONTENTED NOT TO STAY HERE ABOVE TWO OR THREE HOURS
ITS AUTHOR REJOICED IN THE ROMANTIC TITLE OF GAUTHIER DE COSTES CHEVALIER SEIGNEUR DE LA CALPRENEDE
THEY ARE NEWLY COME OVER AND SENT FOR BY HENRY CROMWELL HE TELLS ME BUT NOT HOW HE GOT THEM FOR ME
AND THE BOOK TO WHICH DOROTHY REFERS HERE AND IN LETTER 21 IS PROBABLY THE POEMS AND FANCIES AN EDITION OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED I BELIEVE IN THIS YEAR 1653 MANY OF HER VERSES ARE MORE STRANGELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAN ANYTHING EVEN IN THE POETRY OF TO-DAY
I HAVE MADE A GENERAL CONFESSION TO YOU
I DO NOT BELIEVE MY BROTHER HAS SAID ANYTHING TO HIS PREJUDICE UNLESS IT WERE IN HIS PERSUASIONS TO ME AND THERE IT DID NOT INJURE HIM AT ALL
I SHALL LOSE MY EYES AND YOU THIS LETTER IF I MAKE IT LONGER
HER MOTHER APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY CAREFUL OF HER EDUCATION IN ALL SUCH LIGHTER MATTERS AS DANCING MUSIC AND THE LEARNING OF THE FRENCH TONGUE
DOROTHY WOULD PLAY HERMIONE THE HEROINE
BUT THOUGH THE COLLECTED MATERIAL FOR SOME SHORT LIFE OF SIR PETER OSBORNE LIES AT HAND IT SEEMS SCARCELY NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK AND SO NOT WITHOUT RELUCTANCE IT IS SET ASIDE
HE IS AN HONEST GENTLEMAN IN EARNEST HAS UNDERSTANDING ENOUGH AND WAS AN EXCELLENT HUSBAND TO TWO VERY DIFFERENT WIVES AS TWO GOOD ONES COULD BE
HE MARRIED FRANCES THE ELDEST DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF HOLLAND MY LADY DIANA'S SISTER
THEY WERE BUT POOR AND SHE LIVED HERE WITH HER SISTERS WHEN I KNEW HER
AND IF YOU DO YOU MUST CONSIDER MY INTEREST IN YOU AND PRESERVE YOURSELF TO MAKE ME HAPPY
HIS MISTRESS HAD CAPRICES THAT WOULD HAVE SUITED BETTER WITH OUR AMANT JALOUX THAN WITH ANYBODY ELSE
THEN HE ROSE AND WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR SUCH IS THE STORY WHICH REACHES DOROTHY AND STARTLES ALL ENGLAND AT THIS DATE
THE BURNING OF MY PAPER HAS WAKED ME
THE REST WAS THERE WAS A MARRIAGE IN CANA OF GALILEE WHICH THOUGH IT WAS SCRIPTURE I HAD NOT THAT REVERENCE FOR IT IN MY SLEEP THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD I THINK IF I HAD BEEN AWAKE
WOULD HE LOOK ON ME THINK YOU THAT HAD PRETTY MRS FRETCHEVILLE
AS POPERY DECLINED THE ANGEL DISAPPEARED AND THE LILY-POT BECAME A VASE OF FLOWERS
YOU ARE TOO SEVERE TO WALKER
AND YET SHE IS AS MERRY AS EVER SHE WAS WHICH PERHAPS MIGHT MAKE HER LOOK YOUNG BUT THAT SHE LAUGHS A LITTLE TOO MUCH AND THAT WILL BRING WRINKLES THEY SAY
BUT IT WAS MORE PARDONABLE IN THEM
TO MARRY FOR LOVE WERE NO REPROACHFUL THING IF WE DID NOT SEE THAT OF THE THOUSAND COUPLES THAT DO IT HARDLY ONE CAN BE BROUGHT FOR AN EXAMPLE THAT IT MAY BE DONE AND NOT REPENTED AFTERWARDS
SINCE OUR LAST QUARREL HE HAS COURTED ME MORE THAN EVER HE DID IN HIS LIFE AND MADE ME MORE PRESENTS WHICH CONSIDERING HIS HUMOUR IS AS GREAT A TESTIMONY OF HIS KINDNESS AS TWAS OF MR SMITH'S TO MY LADY SUNDERLAND WHEN HE PRESENTED MRS CAMILLA
BUT IF THERE BE ANYTHING BEYOND IT I WISH IT YOU
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THEN A LIVELY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN OF FASHION NOT BY ANY MEANS DEEPLY READ BUT VERSED IN ALL THE SUPERFICIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN AND ACCEPTABLE IN ALL POLITE SOCIETIES
WHERE WERE MY EYES THAT I DID NOT SEE HIM FOR I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED AT LEAST THAT TWAS HE IF I HAD
RISE QUICKLY YOU HAD BETTER AND COME HITHER THAT I MAY GIVE YOU A LESSON THIS MORNING BEFORE I GO
SO THAT HE IS PERSUADED TO SPEAK OF HER TOO CONSTANTLY FROM THE POSITION OF A MAN OF THE WORLD PRAISING WITH PATRONIZING EMPHASIS THE PRETTY QUALITIES OF A SCHOOL-GIRL
IF YOU STAY THERE YOU WILL WRITE BACK BY HIM WILL YOU NOT A LONG LETTER
THAT IS HE MUST NOT BE SO MUCH A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AS TO UNDERSTAND NOTHING BUT HAWKS AND DOGS AND BE FONDER OF EITHER THAN HIS WIFE
METHINKS YOU SHOULD
SOME BUSINESS SHE HAD THAT REQUIRED HER GOING ABROAD AND SO SHE RESOLVED SHE WOULD NOT BE SICK
BUT AS NOTHING OBLIGES ME TO RELIEVE A PERSON THAT IS IN EXTREME WANT TILL I CHANGE CONDITIONS WITH HIM AND COME TO BE WHERE HE BEGAN AND THAT I MAY BE THOUGHT COMPASSIONATE IF I DO ALL THAT I CAN WITHOUT PREJUDICING MYSELF TOO MUCH SO LET ME TELL YOU THAT IF I COULD HELP IT I WOULD NOT LOVE YOU AND THAT AS LONG AS I LIVE I SHALL STRIVE AGAINST IT AS AGAINST THAT WHICH HAD BEEN MY RUIN AND WAS CERTAINLY SENT ME AS A PUNISHMENT FOR MY SIN
CROMWELL HOWEVER CONSIDERED HIMSELF SECURE IN LORD BROGHILL'S ATTACHMENT
SO THAT LORD LAUDERDALE AND SHE LIVED SO MUCH TOGETHER THAT HIS LADY WAS OFFENDED AT IT AND WENT TO PARIS WHERE SHE DIED ABOUT THREE YEARS AFTER THIS WAS IN 1672 AND SOON AFTERWARDS LADY DYSART AND LORD LAUDERDALE WERE MARRIED
FYE UPON'T I SHALL GROW TOO GOOD NOW I AM TAKING CARE TO KNOW HOW YOUR WORSHIP SLEPT TO-NIGHT
HOWEVER DO NOT FAIL TO WRITE THOUGH THEY LIE AWHILE
AND IF YOU DO NOT I SHALL NEVER LOVE MYSELF
DOROTHY LOVED THIS BOOK AND KNEW IT WELL
YOU UNDO ME BY BUT DREAMING HOW HAPPY WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHEN I CONSIDER HOW FAR WE ARE FROM IT IN REALITY
TIS HANDSOME LANGUAGE
HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF THE FRENCH AND SPANISH LANGUAGES AND AMUSED HIMSELF BY WRITING ESSAYS AND ROMANCES AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH AT LEAST SERVED THE PURPOSE OF FORMING HIS STYLE
AND ALL THIS NOT ONLY TO KEEP QUIET BUT TO KEEP HIM FROM PLAYING THE MADMAN
THERE NEED BE NO EXCUSE FOR THE CONCLUSION OF YOUR LETTER
IF YOU HAVE I CAN FORGIVE YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MEANT WELL IN'T
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOUNG LILLY WHO ATTENDED HER IN HER LAST ILLNESS AND IN RETURN FOR HIS CARE AND ATTENTION SHE BEQUEATHED TO HIM SEVERAL SIGILS OR TALISMANIC SEALS
BUT TRUST ME I HAVE LOOKED FOR IT EVER SINCE I HEARD YOU WERE COME HOME
NOW WE DO NOT ABSOLUTELY AGREE IN THAT POINT BUT I PROMISE HER NEVER TO MARRY UNLESS I CAN FIND SUCH A HUSBAND AS I DESCRIBE TO HER AND SHE BELIEVES IS NEVER TO BE FOUND
HE MUST NOT BE A TOWN GALLANT NEITHER THAT LIVES IN A TAVERN AND AN ORDINARY THAT CANNOT IMAGINE HOW AN HOUR SHOULD BE SPENT WITHOUT COMPANY UNLESS IT BE IN SLEEPING THAT MAKES COURT TO ALL THE WOMEN HE SEES THINKS THEY BELIEVE HIM AND LAUGHS AND IS LAUGHED AT EQUALLY
IT IS THE ONLY LETTER OR RATHER SCRAP OF LETTER WHICH WE HAVE OF HIS AND BY SOME GOOD CHANCE IT HAS SURVIVED WITH THE REST OF DOROTHY'S LETTERS
THIS LETTER IS WRIT IN GREAT HASTE AS YOU MAY SEE
HE WAS NOT GONE WHEN SHE WRIT NOR IS NOT YET
IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU
I HAVE SEARCHED IN VAIN TO FIND THE SERMON WHICH DOROTHY HEARD BUT IT WAS PROBABLY NOT A SERMON GIVEN ON ANY GREAT OCCASION AND WE MAY BELIEVE IT WAS NEVER PRINTED
YOU TELL ME NOTHING WHAT IS DONE THERE BUT TIS NO MATTER
I DO BUT ASK THOUGH DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ONLY BELIEVE YOU DO A GREAT INJUSTICE IF YOU THINK ME FALSE
HE TAKES IT SO HEAVILY THAT I THINK I MUST BE FRIENDS WITH HIM AGAIN
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO SINCE THIS JOURNEY IS BROKE
EVEN WHEN THE WAR ENDED AND SIR PETER OSBORNE RETURNED TO HIS SEAT AT CHICKSANDS THE PROSPECTS OF THE LOVERS WERE SCARCELY LESS GLOOMY
AND THERE REMAINS ABUNDANT PROOF THAT SHE POSSESSED AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE DEXTERITY THE VIVACITY AND THE TENDERNESS OF HER SEX
AFTER GREAT DELAYS SHE OBTAINED L500 AND A GRANT OF L2000 PER ANNUM OUT OF THEIR IRISH LANDS LYING MOST CONVENIENTLY TO DUNMORE HOUSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN THIS MATTER THAT DOROTHY HAD HEARD OF WHEN SHE QUESTIONS WHETHER SHE WILL GET IT WHEN SHE COMES THERE FRANCIS ANNESLEY LORD VALENTIA BELONGED TO AN ANCIENT NOTTINGHAMSHIRE FAMILY THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS BORN IN NEWPORT BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
YOU MUST PROMISE HER TO BE MERRY AND NOT TO TAKE COLD WHEN YOU ARE AT THE TENNIS COURT FOR THERE SHE HEARS YOU ARE FOUND
SIR,--WHY ARE YOU SO SULLEN AND WHY AM I THE CAUSE
AND JANE SAYS YOU ABUSE ME WHEN YOU SAY YOU ARE NOT MELANCHOLY
BUT HAD YOU REASON TO BE DISPLEASED THAT I SAID A CHANGE IN YOU WOULD BE MUCH MORE PARDONABLE THAN IN HIM
AND TWOULD BE VERY UNJUST IN ME TO TIE YOU TO A CEREMONY THAT I DO NOT OBSERVE MYSELF
BUT I BELIEVE BY THAT TIME HIS WIFE HAS A LITTLE RECOVERED HER SICKNESS AND LOSS OF HER CHILD HE WILL BE COMING THIS WAY
HE MARRIED MARY DAUGHTER OF LORD CAPEL OF HADHAM WHO AFTERWARDS MARRIED THE DUKE OF BEAUFORT
AND INDEED HE CONTINUED TO SERVE NOT ONLY CROMWELL DURING HIS LIFETIME BUT HIS SON RICHARD AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH WITH GREAT FIDELITY
SHE HAS BEEN KEPT AT HOME POOR SOUL AND SUFFERED SO MUCH OF PURGATORY IN THIS WORLD THAT SHE NEEDS NOT FEAR IT IN THE NEXT
HE IS SOON TO BE LORD PROTECTOR
AND BOTH AGREED IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE TO FIND OUT A WAY THAT PEOPLE MIGHT FLY LIKE BIRDS AND DESPATCH THEIR JOURNEYS
IT MUST BE HERE AND I MUST ENDURE THE NOISE IT WILL MAKE AND UNDERGO THE CENSURES OF A PEOPLE THAT CHOOSE EVER TO GIVE THE WORST INTERPRETATION THAT ANYTHING WILL BEAR
MARCH 5TH 1653 SIR,--I KNOW NOT HOW TO OBLIGE SO CIVIL A PERSON AS YOU ARE MORE THAN BY GIVING YOU THE OCCASION OF SERVING A FAIR LADY
I MUST HAVE ALL OR NONE AT LEAST THE FIRST PLACE IN IT
TIS ALL THE OBEDIENCE I REQUIRE OF YOU AND WILL BE THE GREATEST TESTIMONY YOU CAN GIVE ME OF YOUR FAITH
THEREFORE TIS NOT THAT I DESIRE TO HIDE IT FROM YOU BUT THAT I DO NOT LOVE TO TELL IT
IN THE MEANTIME I'LL PRACTISE ALL THE RULES YOU GIVE ME
AND UNLESS HE IS PLEASED WITH THAT PART OF MY HUMOUR WHICH OTHER PEOPLE THINK THE WORST TIS VERY POSSIBLE THE NEXT NEW EXPERIMENT MAY CROWD ME OUT AGAIN
IN CONSCIENCE I BELIEVE THE OLD ONE IS THE BETTER
THEY ARE NEITHER OF THEM FAR FROM US
YOU WILL NOT BE IF YOU THINK I AM YOURS
LETTER 26 SIR,--THE DAY I SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED YOUR LETTER I WAS INVITED TO DINE AT A RICH WIDOW'S WHOM I THINK I ONCE TOLD YOU OF AND OFFERED MY SERVICE IN CASE YOU THOUGHT FIT TO MAKE ADDRESSES THERE
NO STAY
THIS IS A FORMAL PREFACE AND LOOKS AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING OF VERY USEFUL TO FOLLOW
TELL ME IF IT BE POSSIBLE I CAN DO ANYTHING FOR YOU AND TELL ME HOW I MAY DESERVE YOUR PARDON FOR ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE GIVEN YOU
TIS OF ONE DELIE PRAY GIVE ME YOUR OPINION OF HER AND HER PRINCE
I SAW HIM NOT LONG SINCE AND HE TOLD ME NO SUCH THING
LETTER 49._--THE BEGINNING OF THIS LETTER IS LOST AND WITH IT PERHAPS THE NAME OF DOROTHY'S LOVER WHO HAD WRITTEN SOME VERSES ON HER BEAUTY
AND YET I'LL SWEAR HE HAS NOTHING TO BE DISLIKED IN HIM BUT HIS WANT OF TONGUE WHICH IN A WOMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VIRTUE
I MUST GO TO ROEHAMPTON TO-DAY BUT TIS ALL ONE YOU DO NOT CARE MUCH FOR SEEING ME
FOR TILL THAT BE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THE OTHER SHOULD
SAMUEL BUTLER THE AUTHOR OF HUDIBRAS LIVED WITH SIR SAMUEL LUKE AS HIS SECRETARY AT SOME DATE PRIOR TO THE RESTORATION
THAT WHICH GAVE ME THE FIRST INCLINATION TO THAT BELIEF WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE YOU TOLD ME OF THEIR SEEING ME AT ST GREGORY'S
HE IS KIND NOW IN EXTREMITY AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO KEEP HIM SO TILL A DISCOVERY IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
THERE ARE SOME STORIES IN'T YOU WILL LIKE I BELIEVE
THERE IS A LETTER LOST
I AM PLEASED THOUGH THAT YOU ARE OUT OF THE POWER OF SO UNCERTAIN THINGS AS THE WINDS AND THE SEA WHICH I NEVER FEARED FOR MYSELF BUT DID EXTREMELY APPREHEND FOR YOU
I SHALL NOT DISPUTE IT WITH HIM BECAUSE IT IS MUCH MORE IN HIS POWER THAN IN MINE BUT I SHALL NEVER YIELD THAT TIS MORE IN HIS DESIRE SINCE HE WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH THAT WHICH WAS A TRUTH WHEN YOU TOLD IT HIM BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN NONE IF HE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION SOONER
YOU SHALL TAKE YOUR CHOICE OF MY FOUR DAUGHTERS
I AM MUCH THE SAME PERSON AT HEART I WAS IN BEING YOURS
BUT THIS TO DEAL FREELY WITH YOU I DO NOT HOPE FOR
THE NEIGHBOURING SCENERY OF BEDFORDSHIRE IS ON A HUMBLE SCALE AND CONCERNS VERY LITTLE THOSE WHO DO NOT FREQUENT IT AND LIVE AMONG IT AS WE MUST DO FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR MORE
AND TO YOU HAVE SO ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO DISCOVER ALL MY HEART THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL EVER BE IN MY POWER TO CONCEAL A THOUGHT FROM YOU
HE HIMSELF WAS ABOUT FORTY-TWO YEARS OF AGE AT THIS TIME AND HAD LOST HIS FIRST WIFE BY WHOM HE HAD FOUR DAUGHTERS IN 1638
LADY GIFFARD TEMPLE'S WIDOWED SISTER JOINING THEM
DEAR I AM YOURS
I PLEASED MYSELF EXTREMELY WITH A BELIEF THAT THEY HAD MADE YOUR VOYAGE RATHER A DIVERSION THAN A TROUBLE EITHER TO YOU OR YOUR COMPANY BUT I HOPE YOUR PASSAGE WAS AS HAPPY IF NOT AS SUDDEN AS YOU EXPECTED IT
AND THAT ONE I MUST LOVE TOO OR ELSE I SHOULD THINK IT A TROUBLE AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT DO IT
LETTER 27._--ALTHORP IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE WAS THE SEAT OF LADY SUNDERLAND'S FIRST HUSBAND ROBERT LORD SPENCER
THE READER WILL REMEMBER THAT MY LADY IS LADY DIANA RICH
TO PREVENT THIS WHO WOULD NOT TAKE STEEL OR ANYTHING,--THOUGH I AM PARTLY OF YOUR OPINION THAT TIS AN ILL KIND OF PHYSIC
HE ASKED ME FOR YOU VERY KINDLY AND IF HE KNEW I WRIT TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY FROM HIM BESIDES WHAT I SHOULD SAY FOR MYSELF IF I HAD ROOM
THEY ARE ALL GONE THIS MORNING AND HAVE LEFT ME MUCH MORE AT LIBERTY THAN I HAVE BEEN OF LATE THEREFORE I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A LONG LETTER
SUMMER 1654 THIS CHAPTER OPENS WITH A PORTION OF A LETTER WRITTEN BY SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE TO HIS MISTRESS DATED IRELAND MAY 18 1654
BUT IF YOU HAVE MET WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY OF AMESTRIS AND AGLATIDES YOU WILL FIND THE REST OF IT IN THIS PART I SEND YOU NOW
BUT I'LL PREVENT HER NOW YOU HAVE PUT ME INTO A JEALOUS HUMOUR
AND YET I AM NOT GIVEN TO IT IN ANY EXCESS NOW
NO MY DEAREST I KNOW YOU DO NOT WHATE'ER YOU SAY YOU CANNOT DOUBT THAT I AM YOURS
WE MUST REST CONTENTED IN KNOWING HIM TO BE A FELLOW-SERVANT
SO I THAT HAD NOT SAID A WORD ALL NIGHT STARTED UP AT THAT AND DESIRED THEY WOULD SAY A LITTLE MORE ON'T FOR I HAD NOT MARKED THE BEGINNING
BESIDES THAT HE THINKS IT WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE TO BE WELL BESTOWED AND BY THAT HE UNDERSTANDS RICHLY
SHE IS MENTIONED AS A PROMINENT LEADER OF LONDON SOCIETY
IN EARNEST I DO PREPARE MYSELF ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO HEAR IT SPOKEN OF YET FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT HEAR YOUR NAME WITHOUT DISCOVERING THAT I AM MORE THAN ORDINARILY CONCERNED IN'T
JAMES B MUST BE ANOTHER LOVER AND HE IS ALTOGETHER UNTRACEABLE
HE WAS CALLED TO THE UPPER HOUSE AS LORD KIMBOLTON IN 1626 AND SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER IN 1642
HOW DESPICABLE THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES BY IT AND HOW SADLY THEY HAVE REPENTED ON'T
I BEG IT OF YOU AS HEARTILY AS I FORGIVE YOU ALL THOSE STRANGE THOUGHTS YOU HAVE HAD OF ME
BUT NEVER ANYBODY WAS SO DEFEATED AS I WAS TO FIND NONE
FOR AS MY LADY SAYS MY TIME FOR PICTURES IS PAST AND THEREFORE I HAVE ALWAYS REFUSED TO PART WITH THIS BECAUSE I WAS SURE THE NEXT WOULD BE A WORSE
SOMETHING THAT I CANNOT DESCRIBE DRAWS A CLOUD OVER ALL THE LIGHT MY FANCY DISCOVERS SOMETIMES AND LEAVES ME SO IN THE DARK WITH ALL MY FEARS ABOUT ME THAT I TREMBLE TO THINK ON'T
I AM AFRAID SHE HAS ALTERED HER OPINION SINCE TWAS TOO LATE FOR I DO NOT TAKE MR HOWARD TO BE A PERSON THAT CAN DESERVE ONE SHOULD NEGLECT ALL THE WORLD FOR HIM
TELL ME MY DEAREST AM I
THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE HAD LOST SOME OF ITS FRESHNESS AND WAS NOT SO MUCH IN VOGUE AS HERETOFORE
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT I DO WILLINGLY DEFER MY JOURNEY
THAT IT WERE TO BE WISHED OUR POLITICIANS AT HOME WOULD CONSIDER WELL THAT THERE IS NO TRUST TO BE PUT IN ALLIANCES WITH AMBITIOUS KINGS ESPECIALLY SUCH AS MAKE IT THEIR FUNDAMENTAL MAXIM TO BE BASE
AND AFTER STOPPING AT ROTTERDAM AND BRABANT FOR SHORT PERIODS THEY SETTLED AT ANTWERP
LETTER 14._--THIS LETTER CONTAINS THE MOST INTERESTING POLITICAL REFERENCE OF THE WHOLE SERIES
BESIDES THAT I NEVER LOOK FOR IT IN MEN
TIS MY MISFORTUNE INDEED THAT IT LIES NOT IN MY POWER TO GIVE YOU BETTER TESTIMONY ON'T THAN WORDS OTHERWISE I SHOULD SOON CONVINCE YOU THAT TIS THE BEST QUALITY I HAVE AND THAT WHERE I OWN A FRIENDSHIP I MEAN SO PERFECT A ONE AS TIME CAN NEITHER LESSEN NOR INCREASE
SAMUEL COOPER WAS A NEPHEW OF JOHN HOSKINS WHO INSTRUCTED HIM IN THE ART OF MINIATURE PAINTING IN WHICH HE SOON OUT-RIVALLED HIS MASTER
THINK ME SO STILL IF THAT WILL DO ANYTHING TOWARDS IT
THERE IS A LETTER OF LADY TEMPLE'S WRITTEN TO HER HUSBAND IN 1670 WHICH SHOWS HOW INTERESTED SHE WAS IN THE PART HE TOOK IN POLITICAL LIFE AND HOW HE MUST HAVE CONSULTED HER IN ALL STATE MATTERS
TIS OVER AGAINST SALISBURY HOUSE WHERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING MY LADY M
I'LL UNDERTAKE HE WOULD SET ME TWENTY SEALS FOR NOTHING RATHER THAN UNDERGO YOUR WRATH
IN 1621 JAMES I
SHE WILL MARRY FOR CERTAIN AND PERHAPS THOUGH MY BROTHER MAY EXPECT I SHOULD SERVE HIM IN IT YET IF YOU GIVE ME COMMISSION I'LL SAY I WAS ENGAGED BEFOREHAND FOR A FRIEND AND LEAVE HIM TO SHIFT FOR HIMSELF
WHICH SIMPLE AS YOU SEE IT WAS SENT ME IN VERY GOOD EARNEST AND BY A PERSON OF QUALITY AS I WAS TOLD
HE WAS BORN IN 1602 AT DISEWORTH AN OBSCURE TOWN IN THE NORTH OF LEICESTERSHIRE
HE SEEMED NOT TO KNOW AND PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE ENGLISH CAPTAIN MEANT
AFTERWARDS MR GIBSON AND HE AND I TALKED OF INDIFFERENT THINGS TILL ALL BUT WE TWO WENT TO BED
KEEP THIS AS A TESTIMONY AGAINST ME IF EVER I DO AND MAKE ME A REPROACH TO THEM BY IT
I WILL DO ALL YOU BID ME
PAINT THE WARTS
LET YOUR FATHER THINK ME WHAT HE PLEASES IF HE EVER COMES TO KNOW ME THE REST OF MY ACTIONS SHALL JUSTIFY ME IN THIS
IF HE HAS AND CONCEALS IT HE IS VERY DISCREET
WE MAY PERHAPS NOT UNFAIRLY TRACE THE GROWTH OF DOROTHY'S AFFECTION FOR TEMPLE BY THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS
I NEVER WANTED NOR AM CONFIDENT I NEVER SHALL
LETTER 30._--HERE IS LORD LISLE'S EMBASSAGE DISCUSSED AGAIN
YOU MUST CONFESS IT
AND IT CANNOT BE UNINTERESTING TO QUOTE A SHORT CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNT OF THE BUSINESS
THE PARK WAS IT SEEMS USED BY THE LATE KING AND NOBILITY FOR THE FRESHNESS OF THE AIR AND THE GOODLY PROSPECT BUT IT IS THAT WHICH NOW BESIDES ALL OTHER EXERCISES THEY PAY FOR HERE IN ENGLAND THOUGH IT BE FREE IN ALL THE WORLD BESIDE
TIS NOT A VERY GOOD ONE BUT THE BEST I SHALL EVER HAVE DRAWN OF ME
I FIND MY CONSCIENCE A LITTLE TROUBLED TILL I HAVE ASKED YOUR PARDON FOR MY ILL-HUMOUR LAST NIGHT
SHE WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY
THE FACT OF THE OLD GARDENS HAVING BEEN CLOSED MAY ACCOUNT FOR DOROTHY REFERRING TO THE PLACE AS NEW SPRING GARDENS KNIGHT ALSO QUOTES AT SECOND HAND FROM AN ACCOUNT OF SPRING GARDENS COMPLAINING THAT THE AUTHOR IS UNKNOWN TO HIM
IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF OR ME YOU MUST CONFESS THAT I HAVE REASON TO CONDEMN THIS SENSELESS PASSION
THIS THOUGH IT WERE NOT MUCH I WAS WILLING TO TAKE HOLD OF AND MADE IT CONSIDERABLE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT
THE GENERAL SAID AGAIN PUT HIM OUT THEN HARRISON AND WORTLEY WORSLEY PUT THEIR HANDS UPON SYDNEY'S SHOULDERS AS IF THEY WOULD FORCE HIM TO GO OUT
THEREFORE I AM AFRAID YOU MUST RESOLVE TO BE VEXED WITH ALL MY SENSELESS APPREHENSIONS AS MY BROTHER PEYTON IS WITH SOME OF HIS WIFE'S WHO IS THOUGHT A VERY GOOD WOMAN BUT THE MOST TROUBLESOME ONE IN A COACH THAT EVER WAS
IT WOULD BE EITHER AT BARNET EPSOM OR TUNBRIDGE ALL OF WHICH PLACES ARE MENTIONED BY CONTEMPORARY LETTER-WRITERS AS HEALTH RESORTS
SINCE TO MAKE THINGS MORE UNMISTAKEABLE TWO DEBONAIR GENTLEMEN WITH HAT IN HAND HAVE SUPERSEDED THE FLORAL ELEGANCIES OF THE OLDEN TIME AND THE POETRY OF THE ART SEEMS LOST SIR,--I AM GLAD YOU SCAPED A BEATING BUT IN EARNEST WOULD IT HAD LIGHTED ON MY BROTHER'S GROOM
WHENEVER YOU COME YOU MUST NOT DOUBT YOUR WELCOME BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU NOTHING FOR THE MANNER ON'T
THERE ARE CONSTANT REFERENCES TO JANE IN THE LETTERS
THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY LIGHT LEADING HIM THROUGH DARK DAYS OF DOUBT ALMOST OF DESPAIR CONSTANT UNWAVERING IN HIS TROTH TO HER
OF MR FISH WE KNOW AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HE WAS DOROTHY'S LOVER AND A NATIVE OF BEDFORDSHIRE PROBABLY HER NEAR NEIGHBOUR
TWAS WRIT IN SUCH DISORDER THE COMPANY PRATING ABOUT ME AND SOME OF THEM SO BENT ON DOING ME LITTLE MISCHIEFS THAT I KNOW NOT WHAT I DID AND BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOST SENSELESS DISJOINTED THING THAT EVER WAS READ
SHE WILL HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR TIS TRUE AFTER HER MOTHER'S DEATH
I HAVE LAID BEFORE YOU THE INCONVENIENCES IT BRINGS ALONG HOW CERTAIN THE TROUBLE IS AND HOW UNCERTAIN THE REWARD
I HAVE FORSWORN BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY THE SAME PERSON
SEND ME WORD IT MAYBE TWAS A COMPLIMENT
AND,--BLESS ME WHITHER AM I GOING
YOU SEE I MAKE NO SCRUPLE OF GIVING YOU LITTLE IDLE COMMISSIONS TIS A FREEDOM YOU ALLOW ME AND THAT I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU WOULD TAKE
LETTER 10._--DOROTHY IS SUFFERING FROM THE SPLEEN A DISEASE AS COMMON TO-DAY AS THEN THOUGH WE HAVE LOST THE GOOD NAME FOR IT
NO IN EARNEST IF I COULD HAVE PERSUADED YOU TO HAVE QUITTED A PASSION THAT INJURES YOU I HAD DONE AN ACT OF REAL FRIENDSHIP AND YOU MIGHT HAVE LIVED TO THANK ME FOR IT
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE CHEEKE FAMILY
IF I COULD PURCHASE THE EMPIRE OF THE WORLD AT THAT RATE I SHOULD THINK IT MUCH TOO DEAR
UNREFINED TASTES AND THAT NEED OF REPOSE IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE WHICH USUALLY ACCOMPANIES ACTIVITY IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS HAD CONSIGNED HIM TO THE DOMINION OF A WOMAN OF LOW CHARACTER DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE CHARMS WHICH SEDUCE AND WHOSE MANNERS DID NOT BELIE THE RUMOUR WHICH GAVE HER FOR EXTRACTION A MARKET STALL OR EVEN ACCORDING TO SOME A MUCH LESS RESPECTABLE PROFESSION
I HAVE NOT SEEN MY SISTER SINCE I KNEW SHE WAS SO
THEY HAVE MADE ME SO VERY HAPPY IN MY NEW CLOTHES AND EVERYBODY THAT COMES DOES ADMIRE THEM ABOVE ALL THINGS BUT YET NOT SO MUCH AS I THINK THEY DESERVE
THAT YOU INTENDED ME ANOTHER AND IN YOUR HASTE HAD MISTOOK THIS FOR THAT
ROBERT LONGE AT CODDENHAM VICARAGE SUFFOLK WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS
TWAS DATED THE 24TH OF AUGUST BUT I RECEIVED IT NOT TILL THE 1ST OF SEPTEMBER
YOU DO NOT THANK ME FOR USING YOUR RIVAL SO SCURVILY NOR ARE NOT JEALOUS OF HIM THOUGH YOUR FATHER THINKS MY INTENTIONS WERE NOT HANDSOME TOWARDS YOU WHICH METHINKS IS ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT ONE IS NOT TO BE ONE'S OWN JUDGE
WHEN TEMPLE IS IN IRELAND HER LETTERS ARE GENERALLY DATED WITH THE DAY OF THE MONTH
AND THAT MY KINDNESS FOR YOU IS BEYOND EXAMPLE ALL THESE TROUBLES ARE PERSECUTIONS THAT MAKE ME WEARY OF THE WORLD BEFORE MY TIME AND LESSEN THE CONCERNMENT I HAVE FOR YOU AND INSTEAD OF BEING PERSUADED AS THEY WOULD HAVE ME BY THEIR MALICIOUS STORIES METHINKS I AM OBLIGED TO LOVE YOU MORE IN RECOMPENSE OF ALL THE INJURIES THEY HAVE DONE YOU UPON MY SCORE
HE FORMS HIS WITH SO MUCH ART AND DESIGN AND IS SO PLEASED WITH THE HOPES OF MAKING SOME DISCOVERY AND I WHO KNOW HIM AS WELL AS HE DOES HIMSELF CANNOT BUT GIVE MYSELF THE RECREATION SOMETIMES OF CONFOUNDING HIM AND DESTROYING ALL THAT HIS BUSY HEAD HAD BEEN WORKING ON SINCE THE LAST CONFERENCE
THIS QUOTATION IS HOWEVER FROM ONE OF SOMERS TRACTS ENTITLED A CHARACTER OF ENGLAND AS IT WAS LATELY REPRESENTED IN A LETTER TO A NOBLEMAN OF FRANCE 1659 THE FRENCHMAN BY WHOM THE LETTER IS WRITTEN--PROBABLY AN ENGLISH SATIRIST IN DISGUISE--GIVES US SUCH A GRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF THE PARKS BEFORE THE RESTORATION THAT AS THE MATTER IS FRESH AND BEARS UPON THE SUBJECT I HAVE NO HESITATION IN QUOTING IT AT LENGTH I DID FREQUENTLY IN THE SPRING ACCOMPANY MY LORD N
THEREFORE LET IT BE PLAINLY AND SINCERELY WHAT HE INTENDS AND ALL
WHAT HAS KEPT HIM FROM MARRYING ALL THIS TIME OR HOW THE HUMOUR COMES SO FURIOUSLY UPON HIM NOW I KNOW NOT
WHAT HAS MADE IT SO MUCH WORSE SINCE
DOROTHY'S BROTHER HAD SPOKEN OF AND BEHAVED TO TEMPLE WITH ALL DISRESPECT BUT NOW THAT HE IS RECONCILED TO THE MARRIAGE DOROTHY WOULD HAVE HIM APPEAR AT LEAST FORMALLY IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
BUT IN THE CASE OF MORE OBSCURE PERSONS,--AS FOR INSTANCE DOROTHY'S BROTHER-IN-LAW SIR THOMAS PEYTON,--ALL THE KNOWN DETAILS OF THEIR HISTORY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY COLLECTED
MY LADY GREY TOLD ME THAT ONE DAY TALKING OF ME TO HER AS HE WOULD FIND WAYS TO BRING IN THAT DISCOURSE BY THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS WHATSOEVER ANYBODY ELSE COULD INTERPOSE HE SAID HE WONDERED I DID NOT MARRY
IS NOT THIS VERY COMFORTABLE
TEMPLE'S SON JOHN TEMPLE MARRIED IN 1685 A RICH HEIRESS IN FRANCE THE DAUGHTER OF MONSIEUR DUPLESSIS RAMBOUILLET A FRENCH PROTESTANT
WE HAVE LIVED HITHERTO UPON HOPES SO AIRY THAT I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED HOW THEY COULD SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF OUR MISFORTUNES
BUT TIS THAT OF MANY PARENTS TO JUDGE THEIR CHILDREN'S DISLIKES TO BE AN HUMOUR OF APPROVING NOTHING THAT IS CHOSEN FOR THEM WHICH MANY TIMES MAKES THEM TAKE UP ANOTHER OF DENYING THEIR CHILDREN ALL THEY CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES
TELL ME WHAT I MUST THINK ON'T
LOVES TO HAVE HIS CHAMBER AND HIS BED TO HIMSELF
NOTHING OF JUDGMENT OR DISCRETION CAN LIVE WITH IT AND IT PUTS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF ORDER BEFORE IT CAN FIND A PLACE FOR ITSELF
THEY SAY NO OTHER MARRIAGE SHALL STAND GOOD IN LAW
SIR T I SUPPOSE AVOIDS YOU AS A FRIEND OF MINE
BUT HE CAME BETTER PROVIDED THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGINED
BUT I WOULD FAIN DIE INNOCENT THAT I MIGHT HOPE TO BE HAPPY IN THE NEXT WORLD THOUGH NEVER IN THIS
IT IS THIS RECTORY THAT IN 1653-54 IS IN THE HANDS OF THE REV
YET I MUST CHIDE TOO
ON WEDNESDAY CARRIED THE LETTER HIMSELF AS HE TELLS ME WHERE TWAS DIRECTED WHICH WAS TO MR COPYN IN FLEET STREET
I'LL SEND IT YOU
ALL YOUR FAULTS WILL BE LAID TO MY CHARGE ELSE AND ALAS
THE PARTICULARS HOW I INTEND TO MAKE THIS GOOD YOU SHALL KNOW WHEN I SEE YOU
THE LAST WEEK SHE WENT TO ONE AS FAR AS WINCHESTER WITH COL
OTHER BEAUTY NOT OUTWARD OF WHICH WE TOO MAY HAVE SEEN SOMETHING MIRROWED DARKLY IN THESE LETTERS
IT WAS THEN BELIEVED THAT WIT AND DISCRETION WERE TO BE RECONCILED IN HER PERSON THAT HAVE SO SELDOM BEEN PERSUADED TO MEET IN ANYBODY ELSE
LET US BUT HOPE THIS CLOUD THIS ABSENCE THAT HAS OVERCAST ALL MY CONTENTMENT MAY PASS AWAY AND I AM CONFIDENT THERE'S A CLEAR SKY ATTENDS US
HAVE NOT YOU FORGOT MY LADY'S BOOK
IN MARCH 1652 SHE IS GRANTED A PASS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ON CONDITION THAT SHE GIVES SECURITY TO DO NOTHING PREJUDICIAL TO THE STATE
UPON THE KING'S RESTORATION SHE THOUGHT THAT LORD LAUDERDALE MADE NOT THOSE RETURNS SHE EXPECTED
YET LET ME TELL YOU SOBERLY THAT WITH ALL MY VANITY I COULD BE VERY WELL CONTENTED NOBODY SHOULD BLAME ME OR ANY ACTION OF MINE TO QUIT ALL MY PART OF THE PRAISES AND ADMIRATION OF THE WORLD
NO LEARNED EDITOR THAT I AM ACQUAINTED WITH HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUGGEST AN EXPLANATION OF THIS CURIOUS EXPRESSION
HE WAS EDUCATED IN PARIS AND ITALY AND FIRST SERVED IN THE ARMY IN IRELAND
LA CLEOPATRE A SIMILAR WORK WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN TWENTY-THREE VOLUMES OF TWELVE PARTS EACH PART CONTAINING THREE OR FOUR BOOKS
HOW SELDOM DO WE SEE A PERSON EXCELLENT IN ANYTHING BUT THEY HAVE SOME GREAT DEFECT WITH IT THAT PULLS THEM LOW ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM EQUAL WITH OTHER PEOPLE
MY DEAREST WILL YOU PARDON ME THAT I AM FORCED TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON
TWAS A STRANGE CAPRICE AS YOU SAY OF MRS HARRISON BUT THERE IS FATE AS WELL AS LOVE IN THOSE THINGS
BUT THEN TO RECOMPENSE THE MORNING I AM IN GOOD HUMOUR ALL THE DAY AFTER FOR JOY THAT I AM WELL AGAIN
IS NOT THIS A STRANGE TURN
BUT HE BEING RESCUED OUT OF THEIR HANDS BY ONE MR ANSTRUTHER THEY RETIRED HOME AND WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER RETURNED WITH ABOUT TWELVE MORE OF THEIR NATION ARMED WITH BREASTPLATES AND HEADPIECES
HIS TONGUE GOES LIKE THE CLACK OF A MILL BUT TO MUCH LESS PURPOSE THOUGH IF IT WERE ALL ORACLE MY HEAD WOULD ACHE TO HEAR THAT PERPETUAL NOISE
MY BROTHER PEYTON DOES INDEED SOMETIMES SEND ME LETTERS THAT MAY BE EXCELLENT FOR AUGHT I KNOW AND THE MORE LIKELY BECAUSE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
THIS BRED A STORY PLEASANTER THAN ANY I HAVE TOLD YOU YET BUT SO LONG A ONE THAT I MUST RESERVE IT TILL WE MEET OR MAKE IT A LETTER OF ITSELF
INDEED I DID NOT
IS IT TRUE THAT ALGERNON SYDNEY WAS SO UNWILLING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE THAT THE GENERAL WAS FAIN TO TAKE THE PAINS TO TURN HIM OUT HIMSELF
TWILL BE SAD NEWS FOR MY LORD KEBLE'S SON
I HAVE FORGOT THIS ONCE OR TWICE TO TELL YOU THAT IF IT BE NO INCONVENIENCE TO YOU I COULD WISH YOU WOULD CHANGE THE PLACE OF DIRECTION FOR MY LETTERS
HOW DO YOU AFTER YOUR JOURNEY
BUT FOR HIS SAKE I SHALL TAKE CARE OF A FINE GENTLEMAN AS LONG AS I LIVE
MAKE ME IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE WRETCHED THAN I AM
LETTER 69 I AM BUT NEWLY WAKED OUT OF AN UNQUIET SLEEP AND I FIND IT SO LATE THAT IF I WRITE AT ALL IT MUST BE NOW
SINCE IF EVER I WISHED IT OTHERWISE TWAS FOR YOUR SAKE
PERHAPS THEY MET IN FRANCE
WE FIND HIM AS MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR SANDWICH FIGURING IN A COMMITTEE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TWO SIR HARRY VANES
WELL IN EARNEST NOW AND SETTING ASIDE ALL COMPLIMENTS I NEVER SAW FINER HAIR NOR OF A BETTER COLOUR
HE WAS KEEPER OF THE PURSE TO EDWARD VI AND WAS TWICE MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE BEING ALICE SISTER OF SIR JOHN CHEKE A FAMILY WE READ OF IN DOROTHY'S LETTERS
I CANNOT SAY THAT I PREFER YOUR INTEREST BEFORE MY OWN BECAUSE ALL YOURS ARE SO MUCH MINE THAT TIS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE HAPPY IF YOU ARE NOT SO
FORGIVE ME THAT THIS IS NO LONGER FOR I AM YOUR
WELL THE NEXT SERVANT I TELL YOU OF SHALL NOT BE CALLED A WHELP IF TWERE NOT TO GIVE YOU A STICK TO BEAT MYSELF WITH
SHE HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH BESIDES
JE SUIS VOSTRE LETTER 62 JUNE THE 26TH 1654 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFOLK JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT HASTENED
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU IN MY LAST THAT HE WAS COME HITHER TO TRY IF HE CAN LOSE AN AGUE HERE THAT HE GOT IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
AND LEST I SHOULD THINK IT WAS HIS CURIOSITY HE TOLD ME VERY INGENUOUSLY HE COULD NOT READ AND SO WE PARTED FOR THE PRESENT
YOUR DOG IS COME TOO AND I HAVE RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE KINDNESS THAT IS DUE TO ANYTHING YOU SEND
SURE YOU TOOK SOMEBODY ELSE FOR MY COUSIN PETERS
THE LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE ASKED ME FOR YOU BEFORE SHE HAD SPOKE SIX WORDS TO ME
HE SENT ME ONE THIS WEEK WHICH IN EARNEST IS AS PRETTY A THING AS I HAVE SEEN A CHINA TRUNK AND THE FINEST OF THE KIND THAT E'ER I SAW
KING CHARLES AND WHO'S RIPE FOR FIGHT NOW
I SPAKE AS IF I HAD NOT DONE SO ALREADY
BUT PATIENCE IS MY PENANCE IS SOMEBODY'S MOTTO AND I THINK IT MUST BE MINE
THE FURTHER REVISION AND PREPARATION THAT THE LETTERS HAVE UNDERGONE IS SHORTLY THIS
YOU ARE ADMITTED TO ALL MY ENTERTAINMENTS
IF YOU DO IT MUST BE IN SAFE HANDS SOME OF THEM CONCERN YOU AND ME AND OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES US VERY MUCH AND THEY WILL ALMOST LOAD A HORSE TO CARRY
I NEVER KNEW ANY SO SATISFIED WITH THEIR OWN INNOCENCE AS TO BE CONTENT THAT THE WORLD SHOULD THINK THEM GUILTY
OF HIS DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE I CAN FIND NOTHING
SHE READ THE VERSES OF COWLEY AND LORD BROGHILL FRENCH MEMOIRS RECOMMENDED BY HER LOVER AND THE TRAVELS OF FERNANDO MENDEZ PINTO
JANE IS MY WITNESS
COLONEL TOM PAUNTON IS TO ME MERELY A NAME
YOU MAY BE DECEIVED YOU NEVER SAW ME IN MOURNING YET
CROMWELL WAS A SOUND CRITIC IN THIS AND HAD DETECTED THE MAIN FAULT OF SIR PETER'S PORTRAITS WHOSE VALUE TO US IS GREATLY LESSENED BY THE ARTIST'S CONSTANT HABIT OF FLATTERY
IF HE DOES I MUST CONCLUDE HE HAS NO VALUE FOR ME AND SURE I NEVER DISOBLIGED HIM TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND SHOULD WITH ALL THE WILLINGNESS IMAGINABLE SERVE HIM IF IT LAY IN MY POWER
EDWARD BAGSHAWE THE YOUNGER PUBLISHED IN 1671 AN ANTIDOTE AGAINST MR BAXTER'S TREATISE OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE
IF ONE COULD BE INVISIBLE I SHOULD CHOOSE THAT
YOU ARE LIKE TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT HOUSEWIFE OF ME
IF YOU ARE PLEASED IT SHOULD END THUS I CANNOT DISLIKE IT
LETTER 60 JUNE 13TH 1654 YOU HAVE SATISFIED ME VERY MUCH WITH THIS LAST LONG LETTER AND MADE SOME AMENDS FOR THE SHORT ONE I RECEIVED BEFORE
BUT DO YOU THINK IT WAS ALTOGETHER WITHOUT DESIGN SHE SPOKE IT TO YOU
WITHOUT IT I SHOULD HAVE HAD STRANGE APPREHENSION AND MY SAD DREAMS AND THE SEVERAL FRIGHTS I HAVE WAKED IN WOULD HAVE RUN SO IN MY HEAD THAT I SHOULD HAVE CONCLUDED SOMETHING OF VERY ILL FROM YOUR SILENCE
DEAR
BETTER PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED IT AND I CAN GIVE NO REASON WHY ALMOST ALL ARE DENIED THE SATISFACTION OF DISPOSING THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN DESIRES BUT THAT IT IS A HAPPINESS TOO GREAT FOR THIS WORLD AND MIGHT ENDANGER ONE'S FORGETTING THE NEXT
AND I MAY TRULY SAY I BEAR MY SHARE OF SUCH
I AM NOT FOR DISGUISES IT LOOKS LIKE GUILT AND I WOULD NOT DO A THING I DURST NOT OWN
MY DEAREST HEART,--I RECEIVED YOURS FROM YARMOUTH AND WAS VERY GLAD YOU MADE SO HAPPY A PASSAGE
YOUR FRIEND AND OBLIGE HER BY YOUR CIVILITIES TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE SENSIBLE OF THE FAVOUR WAS OFFERED YOU THOUGH YOU HAD NOT THE GRACE TO MAKE GOOD USE ON'T
I CANNOT BE MORE YOURS THAN I AM
I'LL SWEAR I BLUSHED FOR HIM WHEN I SAW HE DID NOT
THE REV
THE REV
THE REV
BESIDES HE THOUGHT HE TOLD ME ENOUGH IN TELLING ME MY COUSIN OSBORNE WAS MARRIED
SEND ME WORD HOW YOU DO AND DON'T PUT ME OFF WITH A BIT OF A NOTE NOW
HER NAME IS VERE AND SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF LORD LEIGH OF STONELEIGH
THEY ARE BROTHERS
I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY BE AT SUCH A LOSS AGAIN AS I WAS AFTER YOUR YORKSHIRE JOURNEY
I KNOW THEY MEAN IT SO AND THEREFORE SAY NOTHING ON'T I ADMIT AND SIGH TO THINK THOSE ARE NOT HERE THAT WOULD BE KINDER TO ME
WHICH IS TO BE BELIEVED
HOW HARD IT IS TO THINK OF ENDING WHEN I AM WRITING TO YOU
BUT I MUST TRUST YOU TO TELL MY STORY FOR ME AND WILL HOPE FOR A BETTER CHARACTER FROM YOU THAN HE GIVES ME
YOU MAY DO WELL TO SATISFY ME IN ALL THESE
I AM SO WEARY WITH MEETING IT IN ALL PLACES WHERE I GO
LETTER 71 MONDAY OCTOBER THE 2ND 1654 AFTER A LONG DEBATE WITH MYSELF HOW TO SATISFY YOU AND REMOVE THAT ROCK AS YOU CALL IT WHICH IN YOUR APPREHENSIONS IS OF SO GREAT DANGER I AM AT LAST RESOLVED TO LET YOU SEE THAT I VALUE YOUR AFFECTIONS FOR ME AT AS HIGH A RATE AS YOU YOURSELF CAN SET IT AND THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE MORE OF TENDERNESS FOR ME AND MY INTERESTS THAN I SHALL EVER HAVE FOR YOURS
1653 LETTER 9._--TEMPLE'S SISTER HERE MENTIONED WAS HIS ONLY SISTER MARTHA WHO MARRIED SIR THOMAS GIFFARD IN 1662 AND WAS LEFT A WIDOW WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF HER MARRIAGE
WE MET AT WREST AGAIN
COUSIN HAMMOND WHO WAS GOING TO TAKE LUDLOW'S PLACE IN IRELAND WOULD BE THE COLONEL ROBERT HAMMOND WHO COMMANDED CARISBROOKE WHEN THE KING WAS IMPRISONED THERE
PAINT THE WARTS WHEN THE COURTLY SIR PETER WOULD HAVE MADE A PRESENTABLE PICTURE EVEN OF THE LORD GENERAL HIMSELF
WE HEAR SOMETHING OF EACH OF THEM IN THE FOLLOWING LETTERS
WHEN I HAVE GIVEN YOU HUMBLE THANKS FOR IT I MEAN TO LOOK OVER YOUR OTHER LETTER AND TAKE THE HEADS AND TO TREAT OF THEM IN ORDER AS MY TIME AND YOUR PATIENCE SHALL GIVE ME LEAVE
SIR,--I AM SO FAR FROM THINKING YOU ILL-NATURED FOR WISHING I MIGHT NOT OUTLIVE YOU THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT YOU AT ALL KIND IF YOU HAD DONE OTHERWISE
HER OTHER SISTERS HAD MARRIED AND SETTLED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ENGLAND BEFORE 1653
SHE WAS IN A BESIEGED TOWN AND PERSUADED ALL THOSE OF HER SEX TO GO OUT WITH HER TO THE ENEMY WHICH WERE A BARBAROUS PEOPLE AND DIE BY THEIR SWORDS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE TOWN MIGHT LAST THE LONGER FOR SUCH AS WERE ABLE TO DO SERVICE IN DEFENDING IT
THE NEXT FAIR WIND EXPECT ME
EDWARD GIBSON WHO APPEARS FROM TIME TO TIME IN DOROTHY'S LETTERS AND WHO WAS ON OCCASIONS THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH TEMPLE'S LETTERS REACHED THEIR DESTINATION AND AVOIDED FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF DOROTHY'S JEALOUS BROTHER
HE WAS PROBABLY TOO CLEVER FOR THAT BUT HE DECEIVED OTHERS ADMIRABLY AND WAS ONE OF THE NOTED AND MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE OLD ASTROLOGERS
WHO THOSE DEMOISELLES SHOULD BE THAT WERE AT HEAMSES I CANNOT IMAGINE AND I KNOW SO FEW THAT ARE CONCERNED IN ME OR MY NAME THAT I ADMIRE YOU SHOULD MEET WITH SO MANY THAT SEEM TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH IT
I SHOULD BE PLEASED TO SEE SOMETHING OF MY LADY CARLISLE'S WRITING BECAUSE SHE IS SO EXTRAORDINARY A PERSON
THAT WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THEN OUT OF KINDNESS TO ME AND POINT OF HONOUR I WOULD HAVE YOU DO NOW OUT OF WISDOM AND KINDNESS TO YOURSELF
THE CAPTAIN HAD ORDERS TO SAIL THROUGH THE DUTCH FLEET IF HE SHOULD MEET IT AND TO FIRE INTO THE NEAREST SHIPS UNTIL THEY SHOULD EITHER STRIKE SAIL TO THE FLAG WHICH HE BORE OR RETURN HIS SHOT SO AS TO MAKE A QUARREL
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN OF A LIVELY VIVACIOUS TEMPERAMENT AND VERY POPULAR WITH THE OTHER SEX
AND IF I COULD SHOW THEM YOU TWOULD BE A CERTAIN CURE FOR IT FOR THEY ARE ALL VERY SHORT ONES AND MOST OF THEM MERELY COMPLIMENTS WHICH I AM SURE YOU CARE NOT FOR
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME THAT I MAY TRY TO MEND IT
P.S._]--I RECEIVED YOUR LAST OF JUNE 22ND SINCE I SEALED UP MY LETTER AND I DURST NOT BUT MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR ANOTHER SHORT ONE AFTER YOU HAVE CHID ME SO FOR THOSE YOU HAVE RECEIVED ALREADY
I LAID IT BY AND WISHED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT US THAT I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN NOTICE ON'T TO HIM
THE LAST VERSE IN WHICH HE APOSTROPHIZES HER AS THE SUN IS PECULIARLY GRACEFUL
WELL DREAMS ARE PLEASANT THINGS TO PEOPLE WHOSE HUMOURS ARE SO
I WOULD TRY IF TEN THOUSAND POUND A YEAR WITH A HUSBAND THAT DOTED ON HER AS I SHOULD DO COULD NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING UNHAPPY
TO SAY TRUTH HE LOOKED THEN METHOUGHT LIKE OTHER MORTAL PEOPLE
YOU MUST NEEDS BE PLEASED TO VISIT A PLACE YOU ARE SO MUCH CONCERNED IN AND TO BE A WITNESS YOURSELF OF YOUR HOPES THOUGH I WILL BELIEVE YOU NEED NO OTHER INDUCEMENTS TO THIS VOYAGE THAN MY DESIRING IT
I HAVE EXPECTED YOUR LETTER ALL THIS DAY WITH THE GREATEST IMPATIENCE THAT WAS POSSIBLE AND AT LAST RESOLVED TO GO OUT AND MEET THE FELLOW
I HAD GIVEN OVER THE HOPES ON'T HAVING RECEIVED MY LETTERS BY THE OTHER CARRIER WHO WAS ALWAYS WONT TO BE LAST
EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEAS-COD WITH NINE PEAS IN'T UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS
I AM SORRY IT SHOULD BE ONLY IN MY POWER TO MAKE A FRIEND MISERABLE AND THAT WHERE I HAVE SO GREAT A KINDNESS I SHOULD DO SO GREAT INJURIES
LEAVE THEM BEHIND YOU
HOW LONG THIS LETTER WILL BE I CANNOT TELL
DOROTHY WOULD CALL HIM ARUNDEL HOWARD TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM THE EARL OF BERKSHIRE'S FAMILY
NO I CANNOT FOR I HAVE FORGOT ALREADY WHAT TWAS I WOULD HAVE SAID
LETTER 46 SIR,--THAT WHICH I WRIT BY YOUR BOY WAS IN SO MUCH HASTE AND DISTRACTION AS I CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH IT NOR BELIEVE IT HAS EXPRESSED MY THOUGHTS AS I MEANT THEM
PARTHENISSA IS ONLY JUST OUT
THEN MY MEMORY FAILED ME A LITTLE FOR I FORGOT YOU HAD TOLD ME SHE WAS DEAD AND MEANT TO GIVE HER MANY HUMBLE THANKS IF EVER I WERE SO HAPPY AS TO SEE HER
TO SAY TRUTH I PRESSED HER TOO MUCH CONSIDERING HOW LITTLE THE LETTER DESERVED IT
THEY TOOK THE DEVIL HIMSELF FOR THEIR PATTERN THAT DID IT FOR IN MY LIFE I NEVER SAW SO UGLY A THING AND YET SHE IS AS FOND ON'T AS IF IT WERE AS LOVELY AS SHE HERSELF IS
AT PARIS SHE MET THE MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE WHO MARRIED HER IN THAT CITY IN 1645
NO IN EARNEST I CAN FANCY NO SUCH THING OF YOU OR IF I COULD THE QUARREL WOULD BE TO MYSELF
YOU DOUBTED WHETHER YOU HAD NOT WRIT TOO MUCH AND WHETHER I COULD HAVE THE PATIENCE TO READ IT OR NOT
HIS PAINTING WAS FAMOUS FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS CARNATION TINTS AND THE LOOSE FLOWING LINES IN WHICH HE DESCRIBED THE HAIR OF HIS MODEL
SIR,--IF IT WERE THE CARRIER'S FAULT THAT YOU STAYED SO LONG FOR YOUR LETTERS YOU ARE REVENGED FOR I HAVE CHID HIM MOST UNREASONABLY
PRAY WHERE IS YOUR LODGING
AND NOW I SPEAK OF HER SHE HAS GIVEN ME THE OCCASION TO MAKE A REQUEST TO YOU
THEY ARE MENDING AND SHE HOPES TO BE AT LONDON BEFORE THE END OF THIS NEXT TERM
AND TO SPEAK TRUTH IF YOU DID LIKE IT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE IT FOR YOU DO NOT DESERVE IT
A NOTE HAS BEEN PREFIXED TO EACH LETTER PRINTED IN A MORE CONDENSED FORM THAN THE LETTER ITSELF AND DEALING WITH ALL THE ALLUSIONS CONTAINED IN IT
MR FREEMAN YOU BELIEVE IS DESIGNED FOR SOMEBODY THAT DESERVES HIM BETTER
AND NOW IF PAPA WAS NEAR I SHOULD THINK MYSELF A PERFECT POPE THOUGH I HOPE I SHOULD NOT BE BURNED AS THERE WAS ONE AT NELL GWYN'S DOOR THE 5TH OF NOVEMBER WHO WAS SET IN A GREAT CHAIR WITH A RED NOSE HALF A YARD LONG WITH SOME HUNDREDS OF BOYS THROWING SQUIBS AT IT
NOT BUT THAT ALL THOSE MAY MAKE VERY GOOD HUSBANDS TO SOME WOMEN
HE MAY BE CONFIDENT I CAN NEVER THINK OF DISPOSING MYSELF WITHOUT MY FATHER'S CONSENT
YET I AM CONFIDENT THAT I TAKE IT THE SAFEST WAY FOR I DO NOT TAKE THE POWDER AS MANY DO BUT ONLY LAY A PIECE OF STEEL IN WHITE WINE OVER NIGHT AND DRINK THE INFUSION NEXT MORNING WHICH ONE WOULD THINK WERE NOTHING AND YET TIS NOT TO BE IMAGINED HOW SICK IT MAKES ME FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND WHICH IS THE MISERY ALL THAT TIME ONE MUST BE USING SOME KIND OF EXERCISE
THE END OF THE THIRD VOLUME APPENDIX--LADY TEMPLE CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION AN EDITOR SAYS DR JOHNSON IS HE THAT REVISES OR PREPARES ANY WORK FOR PUBLICATION AND THIS DEFINITION OF AN EDITOR'S DUTY SEEMS WHOLLY RIGHT AND SATISFACTORY
FOR IT IS IN THIS CHAPTER THAT A CLEAR IDEA OF THE DOMESTIC SOCIAL LIFE OF THESE TROUBLOUS TIMES IS OBTAINABLE NONE THE LESS VALUABLE IN THAT IT DOES NOT TALLY ALTOGETHER WITH OUR PRECONCEIVED AND TOO ROMANTIC NOTIONS
HERE I HAVE NOBODY BUT MY BROTHER TO TORMENT ME WHOM I CAN TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DISPUTE WITH AND WHOM I HAVE PREVAILED WITH HITHERTO TO BRING NONE OF HIS PRETENDERS TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF THE NOISE ALL SUCH PEOPLE MAKE IN A COUNTRY AND THE TITTLE-TATTLE IT BREEDS AMONG NEIGHBOURS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO INQUIRE WHO MARRIES AND WHO MAKES LOVE
BESIDES THAT I AGREE WITH YOU TOO THAT CERTAINLY TIS MUCH BETTER YOU SHOULD OWE MY KINDNESS TO NOTHING BUT YOUR OWN MERIT AND MY INCLINATION THAN THAT THERE SHOULD LIE ANY OTHER NECESSITY UPON ME OF MAKING GOOD MY WORDS TO YOU
AS CUNNING AS HE IS HE COULD NOT HIDE FROM ME BUT THAT I SHOULD DISCOVER IT SOME WAY OR OTHER
MY LADY SENDS ME WORD SHE HAS RECEIVED THOSE PARTS OF CYRUS I LENT YOU
I CUT IT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGONE AND IT NEVER GREW SINCE
L'AMANT NON AIME WAS AN ASS UNDER FAVOUR NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRINCESSE CLEOBULINE'S LETTER
THERE MUST BE LETTERS MISSING HERE FOR WE CANNOT BELIEVE MORE THAN A MONTH PASSED WITHOUT DOROTHY WRITING A SINGLE LETTER
WAS THERE EVER ANYTHING SAID LIKE
YET YOU MAY COMMAND ME EVER AT ONE MINUTE'S WARNING
BUT SERIOUSLY TIS AS ILL A SIGHT AS ONE WOULD WISH TO SEE AND APPEARS VERY RUDE METHINKS TO THE COMPANY
SIR,--YOU AMAZE ME WITH YOUR STORY OF TOM CHEEKE
NOT THAT SHE IS AT ALL HANDSOME BUT INFINITELY VIRTUOUS AND DISCREET OF A SOBER AND VERY DIFFERENT HUMOUR FROM MOST OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THESE TIMES BUT HAS AS MUCH WIT AND IS AS GOOD COMPANY AS ANYBODY THAT EVER I SAW
THAT I WOULD NOT FIND AND YOU HAVE ONLY POWER TO MAKE ME THINK IT
HE WAS MASTER OF THE HORSE TO THE EARL OF PEMBROKE AND IS NOTICEABLE TO US AS THE ONLY KNOWN RELATION OF DOROTHY WHO PUBLISHED A BOOK
HAVE NO APPREHENSIONS FROM ME BUT ALL THE CARE OF YOURSELF THAT YOU PLEASE
OR SHALL I SEND HIM TO YOU TO KNOW
NOR IS SHE A WOMAN OF THAT DISCRETION AS TO DO ALL THAT MIGHT BECOME HER WHEN SHE MUST DO IT RATHER AS THINGS FIT TO BE DONE THAN AS THINGS SHE INCLINED TO
THE EARL HOWEVER MISLEADS US IN ONE PARTICULAR
I THINK I TOLD YOU BEFORE HE KEPT HIS CHAMBER EVER SINCE HIS LAST SICKNESS AND SO HE DOES STILL
THERE WERE ONLY THREE SONS LIVING IN 1653
ARISTOCRATS IN BLOOD AND IN SPIRIT OF WHOM DOROTHY WAS A WORTHY DESCENDANT
HERE IS HARDLY ROOM FOR YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND AND SERVANT
BUT IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD A MAN SAY MORE NOR LESS TO THE PURPOSE
HE ULTIMATELY MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF THOMAS LORD LEIGH OF STONELEIGH SOME TIME IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR
HAVE I DONE ANYTHING SINCE THAT DESERVES HE SHOULD ALTER HIS INTENTIONS TOWARDS US
YET HE PROTESTED HE LIKED ME SO WELL THAT HE WAS VERY ANGRY MY FATHER WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE L1000 MORE WITH ME
AND WHEN I CAME DOWN TO THE STABLES I FOUND HIM COME HAD SET UP HIS HORSE AND WAS SWEEPING THE STABLE IN GREAT ORDER
THE CARRIER SHALL BRING YOUR LETTERS TO SUFFOLK HOUSE TO JONES
AS YOU SAY TIS NOT THE BEST I HAVE SEEN NOR THE WORST
WHEN THAT SHALL BE REFUSED ME I MAY BE JUSTLY REPROACHED THAT I DECEIVED MYSELF WHEN I EXPECTED TO BE AT ALL VALUED IN A FAMILY THAT I AM A STRANGER TO OR THAT I SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WITH ANY RESPECT BECAUSE I HAD A KINDNESS FOR YOU THAT MADE ME NOT VALUE MY OWN INTERESTS
I KNOW YOU LOVE ME AND YOU HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT MY KINDNESS
LADY GIFFARD CONTINUED TO LIVE WITH THEM THROUGH THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND SURVIVED THEM BOTH
IT WAS A NEPTUNE I THINK RIDING UPON A DOLPHIN
HENRY CROMWELL UNDERTOOK TO WRITE TO HIS BROTHER FLEETWOOD FOR ANOTHER FOR ME
I GO TO THEM AND COMPARE THEIR VOICES AND BEAUTIES TO SOME ANCIENT SHEPHERDESSES THAT I HAVE READ OF AND FIND A VAST DIFFERENCE THERE
I SHALL NEVER BE ASHAMED TO OWN THAT I HAVE A PARTICULAR VALUE FOR YOU ABOVE ANY OTHER BUT TIS NOT THE GREATEST MERIT OF PERSON WILL EXCUSE A WANT OF FORTUNE
BUT WE ARE NOT GREATLY CONCERNED WITH OXENDEN'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES
OH ME
OH ME
OH ME
OH ME
OH ME
OH ME
I'LL KEEP IT FOR YOU
SHE SPEAKS WITH TOO MUCH INDIFFERENCE OF HER HUSBAND'S SEVERAL AMOURS AND COMMENDS BUSSY AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED IN HIM
BUT THOUGH I AM MERCIFUL TO HIM AS TO ONE THAT HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY I CANNOT EXCUSE YOU THAT PROFESS TO BE MY FRIEND AND YET ARE CONTENT TO LET ME LIVE IN SUCH IGNORANCE WRITE TO ME EVERY WEEK AND YET NEVER SEND ME ANY OF THE NEW PHRASES OF THE TOWN
WOULD ANY ONE IN THE WORLD BUT YOU MAKE SUCH HASTE FOR A NEW COLD BEFORE THE OLD HAD LEFT HIM
WELL TWAS A PRETTY LECTURE AND I GREW WARM WITH IT AFTER A WHILE
IF I HAD BUT A VANITY THAT THE WORLD SHOULD ADMIRE ME I WOULD NOT CARE WHAT THEY TALKED OF ME
BE SURE YOU DO NOT READ IT ALOUD LEST SHE HEAR IT AND PREVENT ME OR DRIVE YOU AWAY BEFORE I COME
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT GIVES HIM HIS ENCOURAGEMENT
WELL TIS TOO GOOD FOR YOU
TWAS ONE REASON MORE THAN I TOLD YOU WHY I RESOLV'D NOT TO GO TO EPSOM THIS SUMMER BECAUSE I KNEW HE WOULD IMAGINE IT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES MY SPLEEN CARRIED ME THITHER
IT WAS A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY TO CHESTER AND NO GOOD ROAD AFTER
MONK'S BROTHER WAS VICAR OF KELKHAMPTON SO THAT GRENVILE AND MONK WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY BE WELL ACQUAINTED BEFORE THE TIME OF THE NEGOTIATION
HOW CARELESS YOU ARE OF A LIFE THAT BY YOUR OWN CONFESSION I HAVE TOLD YOU MAKES ALL THE HAPPINESS OF MINE
THIS WITH CONSTANT ACCOUNTS OF FURTHER ARRESTS TROUBLES THE PUBLIC MIND AT THIS TIME
THAT I AM MARRYING MYSELF
THE ACCOUNT OF HER LIFE ONE DAY AND EVERY DAY IS LIKE A GUST OF FRESH COUNTRY AIR CLEARING AWAY THE MIST OF TIME AND ENABLING ONE TO SEE DOROTHY AT CHICKSANDS QUITE CLEARLY
IF MY PRAYERS ARE HEARD HE WILL NOT BE SO LONG
AND SO YOU DO I AM SURE
BUT HIS GOOD FORTUNE WOULD HAVE IT OTHERWISE TO WHICH I WILL LEAVE HIM AND PROCEED TO GIVE YOU SOME REASONS WHY THE OTHER MOTION WAS NOT ACCEPTED ON
I HAVE SENT YOU YOUR BOOK
EITHER TEMPLE HAS WRITTEN DOROTHY AN ACCOUNT OF CROMWELL'S DISSOLVING THE LONG PARLIAMENT OR PERHAPS SOME NEWS-LETTER HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO CHICKSANDS WITH THE ASTOUNDING NEWS
BUT WHETHER YOU SEE ME OR NOT YOU MAY BE SATISFIED I AM SAFE ENOUGH AND YOU ARE IN NO DANGER TO LOSE YOUR PRISONER SINCE SO GREAT A VIOLENCE AS THIS HAS NOT BROKE HER CHAINS
BUT IF I KNOW MYSELF AT ALL IF I AM CAPABLE OF BEING ANYTHING TIS A PERFECT FRIEND
THERE'S NO SUCH WAY TO MAKE ANYBODY APPEAR LESS HANDSOME THAN THEY ARE
HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF OTHER ROMANCES AND SOME TRAGEDIES NOTED ONLY FOR THEIR WORTHLESSNESS
IF I WERE MRS CHAMBERS HE WOULD BE MORE MY FRIEND
I THINK THAT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY AMONG FRIENDS
FORTY-TWO EXTRACTS FROM THESE LETTERS DID COURTENAY TRANSFER TO AN APPENDIX WITHOUT ARRANGEMENT OR ANY FORM OF EDITING AS HE CANDIDLY CONFESSES
THERE ARE FOUR PRETTY STORIES IN IT L'AMANT ABSENTE L'AMANT NON AIME L'AMANT JALOUX ET L'AMANT DONT LA MAITRESSE EST MORT TELL ME WHICH YOU HAVE MOST COMPASSION FOR WHEN YOU HAVE READ WHAT EVERY ONE SAYS FOR HIMSELF
CROMWELL IS ENGLAND'S KING
YOU ARE KIND IN YOUR GOOD WISHES BUT I AIM AT NO FRIENDS NOR NO PRINCES THE HONOUR WOULD BE LOST UPON ME
ONLY BEING A YOUNGER WOMAN THAN THE RECTOR'S WIFE SHE WAS MORE THE COMPANION AND LESS THE DUENNA
WHAT IS LEFT FOR ME TO SAY WHEN THAT WILL NOT PREVAIL WITH YOU
ARE YOU NOT IN SOME FEAR WHAT WILL BECOME ON ME
I COULD NOT BUT WONDER TO FIND IN IT THAT MY COUSIN FRANKLIN SHOULD WANT A TRUE FRIEND WHEN TIS THOUGHT SHE HAS THE BEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD
AND NOW ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS ALE I BELIEVE I SHALL BE ABLE TO FILL UP THIS PAPER THAT'S LEFT WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER
SIR PETER HAD SEVEN SONS AND FIVE DAUGHTERS
I DID SO PROMISE MYSELF A LETTER ON FRIDAY THAT I AM VERY ANGRY I HAD IT NOT THOUGH I KNOW YOU WERE NOT COME TO TOWN WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRIT
I WAS BORN TO BE VERY HAPPY OR VERY MISERABLE I KNOW NOT WHICH BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL NEVER READ HALF THIS LETTER TIS SO SCRIBBLED
THERE IS YET A MOMENT OF SUSPENSE A LAST TRIAL TO THE LOVER'S CONSTANCY
IS IT NOT LIKELY THEN THAT IF MY FACE HAD EVER BEEN GOOD IT MIGHT BE ALTERED SINCE THEN
NOT THAT I BRAG OF THE FAVOUR HE DID ME FOR ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO THAT HAD BEEN AS OFTEN THERE AND HE WAS LESS SCRUPULOUS IN THAT POINT THAN ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD HAD LESS REASON
ARE MINE SO TO YOU
HE SERVED THE KING SUCCESSFULLY IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND AND WAS DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED AT NEWBURY
THUS WRITES DR TAYLOR
SHE THAT IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR IS SPOKEN OF IN AN OLD NEWS-BOOK AS HAVING LATELY ACTED HER PART IN A TRANCE SO MANY DAYS AT WHITEHALL SHE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FULL OF MYSTICAL ANTI-PURITAN PROPHECIES AND WAS INDICTED IN CORNWALL AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND CONVICTED AND BOUND OVER IN RECOGNIZANCES TO BEHAVE HERSELF IN FUTURE
HERE COMES THE NOTE AGAIN TO TELL YOU I CANNOT CALL ON YOU TO-NIGHT
UNLESS WE WERE SURE TO DIE BOTH TOGETHER TWOULD BUT INCREASE OUR MISERY AND ADD TO THAT WHICH IS MORE ALREADY THAN WE CAN WELL TELL HOW TO BEAR
SIR JOHN TEMPLE HAD A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS ALLIANCE IN VIEW FOR HIS SON
AT SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE'S DEATH IN 1698 HE LEFT NO OTHER DESCENDANTS THAN TWO GRAND-DAUGHTERS--ELIZABETH AND DOROTHY
HE WAS HOWEVER HER FRIEND AND ADVISER THROUGH HER YEARS OF WIDOWHOOD AND IT WAS TO HIS HOUSE IN DRURY LANE THAT SHE RETURNED TO LIVE IN 1661
IT IS ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD MANAGED AS LONG SINCE AS 1649 TO FORCE HIM TO A MARRIAGE
DID YOU NOT INTEND TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU WRIT TO JANE
WHO WOULD NOT GO INTO IRELAND TO HAVE SUCH ANOTHER
WHAT YOU HAVE MET WITH IN HOLLAND THAT COULD KEEP YOU THERE SO LONG
I WAS ONLY CONSIDERING MY OWN ILL-HUMOUR LAST NIGHT I HAD NOT HEARD FROM YOU IN A WEEK OR MORE MY BROTHER HAD BEEN WITH ME AND WE HAD TALKED OURSELVES BOTH OUT OF BREATH AND PATIENCE TOO I WAS NOT VERY WELL AND ROSE THIS MORNING ONLY BECAUSE I WAS WEARY OF LYING IN BED
BUT TO MY FRIENDS I CANNOT BUT CONFESS THAT I AM AFRAID MUCH OF THE FAULT LIES IN US
SIR JOHN WAS THE YOUNGER BROTHER AND HEIR TO THE EARL OF DANBY AND WAS A GENTLEMAN OF THE PRIVY CHAMBER TO THE KING
AMASIS IS THE KING AND POLYCRATES THE CONFEDERATE
FOR MY PART I THINK IT WERE VERY CONVENIENT THAT ALL SUCH AS INTEND TO MARRY SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER IN THE SAME HOUSE SOME YEARS OF PROBATION
SHE CARRIED MY LETTER TO THE WHITE HART BY ST JAMES'S AND TWAS A VERY LONG ONE TOO
I SHALL EXPECT YOUR DIARY NEXT WEEK THOUGH THIS WILL BE BUT A SHORT LETTER
HOW OFTEN I HAVE WISHED MYSELF WITH YOU THOUGH BUT FOR A DAY FOR AN HOUR
AND YOU MAY PARDON IT WITH MORE REASON THAN I HAVE TO FORGIVE IT MYSELF
BUT ON TUESDAY HE DID COME TO TOWN
TIS TRUE THAT I DO FIRMLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE AS YOU SAY TOUJOURS LES MESMES
TEMPLE FORGOT AT EMMANUEL ALL THE LITTLE GREEK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM BISHOP-STORTFORD AND NEVER RETRIEVED THE LOSS
AN UNJUST CHARGE AS HE THINKS
SIR EDWARD HALES WAS A GENTLEMAN OF NOBLE FAMILY IN KENT
SHE IS SO MUCH A STRANGER HERE AND FINDS SO LITTLE COMPANY THAT SHE IS GLAD OF MINE TILL HER EYES WILL GIVE HER LEAVE TO LOOK OUT BETTER
THE OTHERS DIED YOUNG ONE LAYING DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE KING AT HARTLAND IN DEVONSHIRE IN SOME SKIRMISH WE MUST NOW SUPPOSE OF WHICH NO TRACE REMAINS
TWO HERMITS CONVERSING IN A CELL THEY EQUALLY INHABIT NE'ER EXPRESSED MORE HUMBLE CHARITABLE KINDNESS ONE TOWARDS ANOTHER THAN WE
NO YOU ARE MISTAKEN CERTAINLY
YOUR LETTER WAS A MUCH GREATER LOSS TO ME THAN THAT OF HENRY CROMWELL AND THEREFORE TIS THAT WITH ALL MY CARE AND DILIGENCE I CANNOT INQUIRE IT OUT
I SEND YOU A LOVE LETTER TOO
THE CRITICAL POSITION OF AFFAIRS SAYS COURTENAY INDUCED THE DUTCH TO KEEP A FLEET AT SEA AND THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HOPED TO DRAW FROM THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AN OCCASION OF QUARREL
IN EARNEST TIS GREAT PITY
BUT DEATH AND TIME EQUALIZE ALL THINGS
TIS THE INFUSION OF STEEL AND MAKES ME SO HORRIDLY SICK THAT EVERY DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK I AM MAKING MY WILL AND TAKING LEAVE OF ALL MY FRIENDS
GOOD-NIGHT TO YOU
BESIDES THAT HIS TESTIMONY IS NOT OF MUCH VALUE
BUT TIS NOT TO BE HELPED
YOU DO NOT TELL ME WHETHER YOU RECEIVED THE BOOKS I SENT YOU BUT I WILL HOPE YOU DID BECAUSE YOU SAY NOTHING TO THE CONTRARY
THERE IS A MR RALPH FREEMAN OF ASPEDON HALL IN HERTFORDSHIRE MENTIONED IN CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLES
DOWNTON SAYS THEY HAVE STRONG SUSPICIONS HERE YOU WILL COME BACK NO MORE AND THAT THEY SHALL BE LEFT IN THE LURCH
THE KING WRITING TO SIR PETER TO REDUCE THE INHABITANTS TO A STATE OF REASON
THIS MAY BE YOUR DISEASE
THE RELATIONS OF HIS MISTRESS REGARDED HIM WITH PERSONAL DISLIKE AND SPOKE OF HIM AS AN UNPRINCIPLED ADVENTURER WITHOUT HONOUR OR RELIGION READY TO RENDER SERVICE TO ANY PARTY FOR THE SAKE OF PREFERMENT
AND WHATSOEVER YOU MAY BELIEVE I SHALL NEVER REPENT THE GOOD OPINION I HAVE WITH SO MUCH REASON TAKEN UP
BUT THERE IS NO HASTE OF RESTORING THE OTHER UNLESS SHE SHOULD SEND TO ME FOR IT WHICH I BELIEVE SHE WILL NOT
AND IF YOU SEE NOT MY HERO PERSECUTED WITH LOVE BY WOMEN IT IS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS NOT AMIABLE AND THAT HE COULD NOT BE LOVED BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD CLASH WITH CIVILITY IN THE PERSONS OF LADIES AND WITH TRUE RESEMBLANCE IN THAT OF MEN WHO RARELY SHOW THEMSELVES CRUEL UNTO THEM NOR IN DOING IT COULD HAVE ANY GOOD GRACE SIR,--THE LADY WAS IN THE RIGHT
THEREFORE FORBID IT ME THAT I MAY LIVE TO BE YOUR
IF I LOVED YOU LESS I WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BE THE SAME PERSON TO ME AND I WOULD BE THE SAME TO YOU AS HERETOFORE
YET LET NOT THIS GIVE YOU A HOPE
I'LL KEEP HIM UNENGAGED TILL I HEAR FROM YOU
I HOPE YOU DID TRULY WITH ME TOO IN SAYING THAT YOU ARE NOT MELANCHOLY THOUGH SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE IT I AM THOUGHT SO MANY TIMES WHEN I AM NOT AT ALL GUILTY ON'T
THIS WAS PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1886 IN THE ENGLISH ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE AND HAPPENED BY GOOD LUCK TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF AN ADMIRER OF DOROTHY WHO HAVING HAD ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL LETTERS HAD MADE FAITHFUL AND LOVING COPIES OF EACH ONE,--ACCURATE EVEN TO THE OLD-WORLD SPELLING
AND THIS FOND LOVE OF HERS HAS SO ROOTED ALL SENSE OF NATURE OUT OF HER HEART THAT THEY SAY SHE IS NO MORE MOVED THAN A STATUE WITH THE AFFLICTION OF A FATHER AND MOTHER THAT DOTED ON HER AND HAD PLACED THE COMFORT OF THEIR LIVES IN HER PREFERMENT
FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT COMPLAIN SO THAT YOU DO NOT SEE ME
BUT PERHAPS I FORESAW YOU WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO OWN A DISEASE THAT THE SEVERE PART OF THE WORLD HOLDS TO BE MERELY IMAGINARY AND AFFECTED AND THEREFORE PROPER ONLY TO WOMEN
NAY I DESERVE IT ALL FOR HAD YOU NEVER SEEN ME YOU HAD CERTAINLY BEEN HAPPY
ONLY IF SHE BE NOT I DO NOT SEE HOW ANYBODY ELSE CAN HOPE IT
AT LENGTH MY AUNT WITH WHOM I WAS WHEN YOU LAST SAW ME COMMANDED ME TO WAIT ON HER AT LONDON
THIS IS TOO TRUE BOTH IN RESPECT OF THIS FELLOW'S POST THAT IS BAWLING AT ME FOR MY LETTER AND OF MY FATHER'S DELAYS
WITH WHAT REVERENCE HE APPROACHES HER AND HOW LIKE A GRACIOUS PRINCESS SHE RECEIVES HIM THAT THEY SAY TIS WORTH ONE'S GOING TWENTY MILES TO SEE IT
BUT TO SHOW YOU BY EXCEPTING ONLY AN IMPOSSIBLE THING THAT I EXCEPTED NOTHING
DO NOT YOU BELIEVE THIS
BECAUSE I HEARD ONE T'OTHER DAY SPEAKING OF HIM AND COMMENDING HIS WIT BUT WITHAL SAID HE WAS A PERFECT ATHEIST
I HAVE KNOWN YOU LONG ENOUGH TO DISCERN THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE QUALITIES THAT MAKE AN EXCELLENT FRIEND AND I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO DESERVE THAT YOU MAY BE SO TO ME
AND I COULD NOT HAVE FLATTERED HIM INTO A BELIEF THAT I ADMIRED HIM TO GAIN MORE THAN HE AND ALL HIS GENERATION ARE WORTH
PAUNTON IF YOU KNOW SUCH A ONE AND THERE HER HUSBAND MET HER AND BECAUSE HE DID SO THOUGH IT TWERE BY ACCIDENT THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO INVITE HER TO HIS HOUSE BUT SEVEN MILES OFF AND VERY MODESTLY SAID NO MORE FOR IT BUT THAT HE THOUGHT IT BETTER THAN AN INN OR AT LEAST A CROWDED ONE AS ALL IN THE TOWN WERE NOW BECAUSE OF THE RACE
AND IN EARNEST SHE WAS THEN THE LOVELIEST LADY THAT COULD BE LOOKED ON I THINK
BUT I ASSURED HIM THAT THOUGH I THOUGHT IT VERY FIT SUCH AS HE SHOULD BE GOVERNED YET I SHOULD NOT LIKE THE EMPLOYMENT BY NO MEANS
BUT SINCE THINGS DID NOT SUCCEED I THOUGHT TO HAVE SAID NOTHING ON'T LEST YOU SHOULD IMAGINE I EXPECTED THANKS FOR MY GOOD INTENTION OR RATHER LEST YOU SHOULD BE TOO MUCH AFFECTED WITH THE THOUGHT OF WHAT YOU HAVE LOST BY MY IMPRUDENCE
THIS AND THE AGUE PLAGUE HER CONTINUALLY
MY BROTHER'S GROOM CAME DOWN TO-DAY TOO AND SAW HER HE TELLS ME BUT BRINGS ME NOTHING FROM HER
I MADE BOTH THEM CHOOSE FIRST THAT HAD NEVER SEEN WHAT WAS IN THEM AND THEY LEFT ME YOU
OF A DISCERNING SPIRIT BUT A CHOLERIC NATURE INCREASED BY THE OFFICE HE HELD OF CHAMBERLAIN TO THE KING WHY THEN DID THE ACCOMPLISHED LADY ANNE CLIFFORD UNITE HERSELF TO SO WORTHLESS A PERSON
I AM AFRAID IT WILL
SINCE IF YOU WILL PARDON ME THE COMPARISON I BELIEVE WE BOTH MERIT IT FROM YOU UPON THE SAME SCORE HE AS A VERY INDULGENT FATHER AND I AS A VERY KIND MISTRESS
WHATEVER WERE THE CAUSES OF THE QUARREL OR RATHER THE DESPONDENCY WE SHALL NEVER KNOW ACCURATELY
I SHOULD BECOME A CROWN SO ILL THERE WOULD BE NO STRIVING FOR IT AFTER ME AND SURE I SHOULD NOT WEAR IT LONG
AND NOW THAT TIS SOME NINE YEARS PAST SHE IS PASSIONATELY TAKEN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER AND HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN SO NOBODY KNOWS BUT HERSELF
METHINKS HE WAKES OUT OF HIS LONG SLEEP LIKE A FROWARD CHILD THAT WRANGLES AND FIGHTS WITH ALL THAT COMES NEAR IT
AND HARK YOU CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER THE GENTLEMAN THAT LOST A CRYSTAL BOX THE 1ST OF FEBRUARY IN ST JAMES PARK OR OLD SPRING GARDENS HAS FOUND IT AGAIN OR NOT I HAVE STRONG CURIOSITY TO KNOW
IT IS NO GREAT SORROW AT THE MOMENT TO LEAVE CHICKSANDS FOR ITS LATEST MEMORIES ARE SCENES OF SICKNESS GRIEF AND DEATH
AND HAD PASSED THROUGH THE VARYING FORTUNES OF A FASHIONABLE PORTRAIT-PAINTER WHOSE POSITION LEANING AS IT DOES ON THE FICKLE APPROBATION OF THE CONNOISSEURS IS ALWAYS LIABLE TO BE WRESTED FROM HIM BY A YOUNGER RIVAL
IN THE NOTES THEMSELVES THE ENDEAVOUR HAS BEEN TO OBTAIN WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE PARALLEL REFERENCES TO LETTERS DIARIES OR MEMOIRS AND THE EDITOR CAN ONLY REGRET THAT HIS RESEARCHES THROUGH BOTH MSS
AND THOUGH PERHAPS I AM TOO UNHAPPY MYSELF EVER TO MAKE ANYBODY ELSE HAPPY YET SURE I SHALL TAKE HEED THAT MY MISFORTUNES MAY NOT PROVE INFECTIOUS TO MY FRIENDS
BUT THE SKIN BEAUTY IS NOT THE FIRMEST HOLD SHE HAS ON TEMPLE'S AFFECTIONS
FOR THROUGH THIS PARTLY WE HAVE ATTAINED TO A KNOWLEDGE OF DOROTHY'S SURROUNDINGS
HE WAS TOLD I HAD THOUGHT OF MARRYING A GENTLEMAN THAT HAD NOT ABOVE TWO HUNDRED POUND A YEAR ONLY OUT OF MY LIKING TO HIS PERSON
YET TIS NOT WANT OF LOVE GIVES ME THESE FEARS
OR IS IT AS UNFIT FOR ME TO OWN THE CHANGE AS THE TIME THAT MAKES IT
E-TEXT PREPARED BY JULIET SUTHERLAND CERA KRUGER AND THE PROJECT GUTENBERG ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM THE LOVE LETTERS OF DOROTHY OSBORNE TO SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE 1652-54 EDITED BY EDWARD ABBOTT PARRY NEW YORK 1901 TO MY DAUGHTER HELEN THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED EXEMPLI GRATIA EDITORIAL NOTE IT HAVING BEEN NOTED IN THE ATHENAEUM JUNE 9 1888 THAT RUMOURS WERE AFLOAT DOUBTING THE AUTHENTICITY OF THESE LETTERS AND THAT THESE RUMOURS WOULD SINK TO REST IF THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGINALS WERE PUBLISHED I HASTEN TO ADOPT MY REVIEWER'S SUGGESTION AND GIVE AN OUTLINE OF THEIR STORY
AND MY GENTLEMAN SHALL BE KEPT AT SUCH A DISTANCE AS I HOPE TO HEAR NO MORE OF HIM
I VOW TO GOD I WOULD NOT ENDURE ANOTHER NIGHT LIKE THE LAST TO GAIN A CROWN I WHO RESOLVED TO TAKE NO NOTICE WHAT AILED HIM SAID TWAS A KNOWLEDGE I HAD RAISED FROM MY SPLEEN ONLY AND SO FELL INTO A DISCOURSE OF MELANCHOLY AND THE CAUSES AND FROM THAT I KNOW NOT HOW INTO RELIGION
AND IF ANYBODY SHOULD TELL ME THAT I HAVE HAD A GREATER KINDNESS AND ESTEEM FOR YOU THAN FOR ANY ONE BESIDES I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD DENY IT
I SHALL LONG TO HEAR FROM YOU
FROM WHAT IS SHE FALLEN
AS SHE DOES NOT MENTION HIS DEATH TO TEMPLE WE MAY TAKE IT THAT HE WAS THOUGH HER BROTHER PRACTICALLY A STRANGER TO HER LIVING AWAY FROM CHICKSANDS AND RARELY VISITING HER
COME THINK YOU
TEMPLE WHEN DOROTHY'S THOUGHTS REACH HIM MUST HAVE REPLIED WITH SOME IMPATIENCE
TIS A SISTER OF MY LADY GREY'S HER NAME IS POOLEY
METHINKS IT SHOULD
TO US SURELY IT IS AS USEFUL TO KNOW HOW THE YOUNG LADIES OF ENGLAND EMPLOYED THEMSELVES A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YEARS AGO HOW FAR THEIR MINDS WERE CULTIVATED WHAT WERE THEIR FAVOURITE STUDIES WHAT DEGREE OF LIBERTY WAS ALLOWED TO THEM WHAT USE THEY MADE OF THAT LIBERTY WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEY MOST VALUED IN MEN AND WHAT PROOFS OF TENDERNESS DELICACY PERMITTED THEM TO GIVE TO FAVOURED SUITORS AS TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SEIZURE OF FRANCHE-COMTE AND THE TREATY OF NIMEGUEN
HERE IS ANOTHER FOR YOU WHICH WHEN YOU HAVE READ YOU KNOW HOW TO DISPOSE
IF I KNEW WHO THE PERSON WERE THAT IS CONCERN'D IN'T SHE ALLOWS ME SO MUCH FREEDOM WITH HER THAT I COULD EASILY PUT HER UPON THE DISCOURSE AND I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD USE MUCH OF DISGUISE IN IT TOWARDS ME
BUT WE CAN NEVER QUITE FORGIVE THE APOLOGETIC PARAGRAPH WITH WHICH HE RELEGATES DOROTHY OSBORNE'S LETTERS TO THE MOULDY OBSCURITY OF AN APPENDIX
MORTON IS NOTHING MORE UNLESS WE MAY BELIEVE HIM TO BE SIR JOHN MORTON BART
SHE HAD GREAT POWER OVER HIM AND EMPLOYED IT IN TRAFFICKING WITH SUCH STATE PATRONAGE AS WAS IN LORD LAUDERDALE'S POWER TO BESTOW
I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO STAY TILL I COULD RISE BUT MADE HER TIE UP ALL THE CURTAINS TO LET IN LIGHT
CHIXON CHIKESONDS OR CHICKSANDS PRIORY BEDFORDSHIRE AS IT NOW STANDS,--WHAT A PLEASING VARIOUS ART WAS SPELLING IN OLDEN TIME,--WAS IN THE REIGN OF EDWARD III A NUNNERY SITUATED THEN AS NOW ON A SLIGHT EMINENCE WITH GENTLY RISING HILLS AT A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND AND A BROOK RUNNING TO JOIN THE RIVER IVEL THENCE THE GERMAN OCEAN ALONG THE VALLEY IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
I KNOW HER THE LEAST OF ALL THE SISTERS AND PERHAPS TIS TO MY ADVANTAGE THAT SHE KNOWS ME NO MORE SINCE SHE SPEAKS SO OBLIGINGLY OF ME
THE NEXT DAY I NOT BEING AT DINNER SAW HIM NOT TILL NIGHT
AND AMONG SOME OTHERS I FOUND MY DEAR LETTER THAT WAS FIRST TO BE READ AND WHICH MADE ALL THE REST NOT WORTH THE READING
LETTER 7._--THERE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TWO CARRIERS BRINGING LETTERS TO DOROTHY AT THIS TIME HARROLD AND COLLINS
CONTENT YOURSELF WITH YOUR OLD MISTRESS
THE PASSAGE OF COWLEY WHICH DOROTHY REFERS TO IS IN THE SECOND BOOK OF COWLEY'S DAVIDEIS
RELIGIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY GLIDING INTO A VERY PRETTY AND ENDEARING SORT OF PREACHING YET NOT TOO GOOD TO PARTAKE OF SUCH DIVERSIONS AS LONDON AFFORDED UNDER THE MELANCHOLY RULE OF THE PURITANS OR TO GIGGLE A LITTLE AT A RIDICULOUS SERMON FROM A DIVINE WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT LIGHTS OF THE ASSEMBLY AT WESTMINSTER
THAT SOMETHING IS STRIKING UP WITH FRANCE AND THAT YOU ARE SENT AWAY BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO WELL INCLINED TO THESE COUNTRIES
IT IS IN FACT MORE A COLLECTION OF ROMANCES THAN A SINGLE ROMANCE
COME I KNOW YOU DO SAYS SHE IF YOU WOULD CONFESS IT AND I CANNOT BLAME YOU
HE WAS YOU REMEMBER A SUITOR FOR DOROTHY'S HAND BUT HAS NOW MARRIED LADY BRIDGET LINDSAY
A MASTY MASTIF IS HANDSOMER TO ME THAN THE MOST EXACT LITTLE DOG THAT EVER LADY PLAYED WITHAL
IT WAS TO HIM CROMWELL IS SAID TO HAVE SHOUTED
I AM MORE LIKELY TO LOOK OLD BEFORE MY TIME WITH GRIEF
NO LET ME ASSURE YOU THIS RIVAL NOR ANY OTHER SHALL EVER ALTER ME THEREFORE SPARE YOUR JEALOUSY OR TURN IT ALL INTO KINDNESS
AND LET ME ASK YOU WHETHER IT BE POSSIBLE THAT MR GREY MAKES LOVE THEY SAY HE DOES TO MY LADY JANE SEYMOUR
BUT YOU SHALL DO ONE FAVOUR FOR ME INTO THE BARGAIN
TIS A NEW FORM FOR IT THAT SURE WILL FRIGHT THE COUNTRY PEOPLE EXTREMELY FOR THEY APPREHEND NOTHING LIKE GOING BEFORE A JUSTICE
NOR SHALL I EVER REPENT IT SO UNLESS YOU SHALL EVER REPENT YOURS
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE WITH IT LEAVE IT AT MR HOLLINGSWORTH'S AND I'LL SEND YOU ANOTHER
BUT MORE PROBABLY IT IS THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SHE IS REPRODUCING FROM A MEMORY NOT UNSTORED WITH SUCH LEARNING
WOULD YOU SAW WHAT LETTERS MY BROTHER WRITES ME
AND THAT WHICH IS BUT VERY ORDINARY NOW WOULD THEN BE COUNTED HANDSOME FOR AN OLD WOMAN
I COULD NOT CRY FOR A HUSBAND THAT WERE INDIFFERENT TO ME LIKE YOUR COUSIN
THE DUTCHMAN SAID HE HAD NO ORDERS UPON THE POINT WHICH HE RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO BE STILL UNSETTLED AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE FLEET COMMANDED BY AN ADMIRAL WAS TO STRIKE TO THE KING'S PLEASURE-BOAT
AND SIR JOHN OSBORNE PETER'S SON AND DOROTHY'S GRANDFATHER WAS THE FIRST OSBORNE OF CHICKSANDS
MORTON AND THE REST WOULD HAVE GONE SHE COULD HAVE BEEN CONTENTED TO HAVE TAKEN HIS OFFER
HE WAS OF QUICK APPREHENSION SHARP UNDERSTANDING VERY CRAFTY WITHAL
THE TUNE IS NOT WORTH THE SENDING SO FAR
BUT IN THE DAYTIME I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT AND TIS ALL MY DIVERSION AND INFINITELY MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN ANY COMPANY BUT YOURS
PRAY WHAT IS MEANT BY WELLNESS AND UNWELLNESS
SHE MARRIED SIR HARRY YELVERTON A MATCH OF WHICH DOROTHY THOROUGHLY APPROVED
I'LL TELL YOU STORIES ANOTHER TIME YOU RETURN THEM SO HANDSOMELY UPON ME
HIS DESCRIPTION OF HIS POLITICAL CREED IS BEAUTIFULLY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN
AND WHEN I CAME SHE TOLD ME HOW MUCH I WAS IN HER CARE HOW WELL SHE LOVED ME FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE AND SOMETHING FOR MY OWN AND DREW OUT A LONG SET SPEECH WHICH ENDED IN A GOOD MOTION AS SHE CALL'D IT
IT SHALL NEVER BE SAID I BEGAN ANOTHER AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT THOUGH I HAVE SPENT THIS IDLY THAT SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU WITH A LITTLE MORE CIRCUMSTANCE HOW PERFECTLY I AM YOURS
NO YOU CANNOT HAVE SO LITTLE REASON LEFT AS YOU PRETEND NOR SO LITTLE RELIGION
HE IS CONCERNED IN THE SAME YEAR IN THE ESCAPE OF KING JAMES PROVIDING HIM WITH A FISHING-BOAT TO CARRY HIM INTO FRANCE
SIR JOHN OSBORNE MARRIED DOROTHY BARLEE GRANDDAUGHTER OF RICHARD LORD RICH LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND IN THE REIGN OF HENRY VIII
TIS A COMFORTABLE THING WHEN ONE IS ON THIS SIDE TO KNOW THAT SUCH A THING CAN BE DONE IN SPITE OF CONTRARY WINDS
PERHAPS HE IS NOT IN THE HUMOUR OF KEEPING HIS WORD AT PRESENT AND NOBODY CAN BLAME HIM IF HE BE OFTEN IN AN ILL ONE
TILL HE FINDING WHAT WAS SAID UPON IT BROKE IT OFF
THAT I NOW THINK IS THOUGH I CAN REMEMBER WHEN NOBODY COULD HAVE PERSUADED ME THAT ANYBODY MEANT ILL WHEN IT DID NOT APPEAR BY THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS
THE CIVIL WAR DISTURBED EVEN THE QUIET CLOISTERS AND BOWLING-GREENS OF CAMBRIDGE PRODUCED VIOLENT REVOLUTIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT AND DISCIPLINE OF THE COLLEGES AND UNSETTLED THE MINDS OF THE STUDENTS
LETTER 20._--IN THIS LETTER THE JOURNEY INTO SWEDEN IS GIVEN UP FINALLY AND TEMPLE IS ONCE MORE WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT OR THE HOPE OF EMPLOYMENT
TWAS SO GREAT A PAIN TO ME THAT I AM RESOLV'D YOU SHALL NOT FEEL IT
BY THE WAY THIS PUTS ME IN MIND ON'T HAVE YOU READ THE STORY OF CHINA WRITTEN BY A PORTUGUESE FERNANDO MENDEZ PINTO I THINK HIS NAME IS
HE SWEARS TO ME HE NEVER COMES OUT OF TOWN BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND THAT MY LADY PAYNTER'S FOOTMAN AS HE CALLS HIM BRINGS HER LETTERS TWO HOURS SOONER THAN HE NEEDS TO DO
IT BECOMES NO WOMAN AND DID SO ILL WITH THIS LADY THAT IN MY OPINION IT SPOILED A GOOD FACE AND A VERY FINE GOWN
HE WAS KNOWN AND VISITED BY ALL THE GREAT MEN OF THE DAY AND PROBABLY HAD BRAINS ENOUGH ONLY TO PROPHESY WHEN HE KNEW
SHE HAS CAST HIM OFF MOST UNHANDSOMELY THAT'S THE TRUTH ON'T AND WOULD HAVE TIED HIM TO SUCH CONDITIONS AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SLAVE WITHAL BUT COULD NEVER BE HER HUSBAND
I NEVER SAW BUT FOUR TOMES OF HER AND WAS TOLD THE GENTLEMAN THAT WRIT HER STORY DIED WHEN THOSE WERE FINISHED
WAS DOROTHY IN LONDON TO PURCHASE HER TROUSSEAU
NEVER ANYBODY WAS PERSECUTED WITH SUCH LONG EPISTLES
THE SHEPHERD THAT BRAGGED TO THE TRAVELLER WHO ASKED HIM WHAT WEATHER IT WAS LIKE TO BE THAT IT SHOULD BE WHAT WEATHER PLEASED HIM AND MADE IT GOOD BY SAYING IT SHOULD BE WHAT WEATHER PLEASED GOD AND WHAT PLEASED GOD SHOULD PLEASE HIM SAID AN EXCELLENT THING IN SUCH LANGUAGE AND KNEW ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD IF HE MADE A RIGHT USE ON'T
BUT WHERE THERE IS IT MAY LAST ETERNALLY.--I AM YOURS
IF I WERE QUITE ASLEEP I SHOULD SAY FINE THINGS TO YOU
WE FIND ALLUSIONS TO HER IN MANY OF THESE LETTERS
YOU MUST GIVE NAN LEAVE TO CUT A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR FOR ME TOO
WHEN HE IS ROUGHLY DEALT WITH HE IS LIKE ME TEN TIMES THE WORSE FOR'T
LETTER 68._--IN THIS SCRAP OF WRITING WE FIND THAT TEMPLE IS AGAIN IN ENGLAND WITH CERTAIN PROPOSALS FROM HIS FATHER AND READY TO DISCUSS THE TREATY AS DOROTHY CALLS IT WITH HER BROTHER PEYTON
IF I HAD THOUGHT HIS STORY WOULD HAVE PROVED SO LONG YOU SHOULD HAVE MISSED ON'T AND THE LOSS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GREAT
PROBABLY IT WAS THE FOOLISHNESS OF THIS POOR WOMAN THAT FIRST SUGGESTED TO LILLY THE ADVANTAGES TO BE GAINED FROM THE PROFESSION OF ASTROLOGY
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO MENTION HIS REPUBLICAN SYMPATHIES AND AFTER THE DISMISSAL OF THE PARLIAMENT HIS FUTURE ACTIONS CONCERN US BUT LITTLE
ALL THAT IS TO BE HOPED IS THAT SINCE HE MAY REDUCE WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASES TO HIS OBEDIENCE HE WILL BE VERY CURIOUS IN HIS CHOICE AND THEN I AM SECURE
MANY OF HIS TRACTS ARE STILL EXTANT AND THEY CONTAIN EXTRAVAGANT PROPHECIES COUCHED IN THE PECULIAR PHRASEOLOGY OF THE DAY
NOT THAT I WOULD DISCLAIM MY PART IN IT OR LESSEN MY OBLIGATION TO YOU NO I AM YOUR FRIEND AS MUCH AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE I THINK MORE AND I AM SURE I SHALL NEVER BE LESS
HER MOTHER HAD TURNED CATHOLIC IN 1637 WHICH HAD LED TO AN ESTRANGEMENT BETWEEN HER AND HER HUSBAND AND WE MAY CONCLUDE POOR LADY ANNE HAD BY NO MEANS A HAPPY HOME
ALL THIS WHILE I WAS IN A DREAM
I CAN ALLOW YOU TO TELL ME OF MY FAULTS KINDLY AND LIKE A FRIEND
AND HAVE YOU NOT GIVEN HIM AN EXPECTATION THAT I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO SATISFY
BUT SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE MADE ANY DEEP STUDY OF THE CLASSICS
AND THEREFORE I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE IT ME YOU THAT CAN FORGIVE ME ANYTHING YOU SAY AND BE DISPLEASED WITH NOTHING WHILST I LOVE YOU
I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU CAME BY AN ACQUAINTANCE THERE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD YOU SPEAK THAT YOU KNEW THEM
WILL IT NOT STAY YOUR FATHER'S JOURNEY TOO
WINTER AND SPRING 1652-53 THIS FIRST CHAPTER BEGINS WITH A LONG LETTER DATED FROM CHICKSANDS SOME TIME IN THE AUTUMN OF 1652 WHEN TEMPLE HAS RETURNED TO ENGLAND AFTER A LONG ABSENCE
HE IS SO AMONGST HIS CHILDREN TOO THOUGH HE LOVES THEM PASSIONATELY
IT WILL NEVER ENTER INTO MY HEAD THAT TIS POSSIBLE ANY WOMAN CAN LOVE WHERE SHE IS NOT FIRST LOVED AND MUCH LESS THAT IF THEY SHOULD DO THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE FACE TO OWN IT
IN 1665 IT WAS THE TOWN HOUSE OF MR SECRETARY BENNET AFTERWARDS LORD ARLINGTON
BUT THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN'S KIND LETTER TO THE KING OF SCOTS WAS INTERCEPTED BY HER OWN AMBASSADOR BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT FOR HIS MISTRESS'S HONOUR AT LEAST THAT WAS HIS PRETENDED REASON AND THOUGHT JUSTIFIABLE ENOUGH
THAT GAIETY WHICH YOU SAY IS ONLY ESTEEMED WOULD BE INSUPPORTABLE TO ME AND I CAN AS LITTLE ENDURE A TONGUE THAT'S ALWAYS IN MOTION AS I COULD THE CLICK OF A MILL
SIR H
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS MADE ADDRESSES TIS TRUE IN SEVERAL PLACES SINCE WE PARTED BUT COULD NOT FIX ANYWHERE
SHALL WE EVER BE SO HAPPY THINK YOU
PERHAPS TOO LONG AT LEAST IF MY LETTERS ARE AS LITTLE ENTERTAINING AS MY COMPANY IS
IF I HAD NOT HAD OCCASION TO STOP THERE I MIGHT HAVE GONE TOO FAR AND SHOWED THAT I HAD MORE PASSIONS THAN ONE
I KNOW NOT HOW I STUMBLED UPON A NEWS-BOOK THIS WEEK AND FOR WANT OF SOMETHING ELSE TO DO READ IT
I THINK HER A BETTER SISTER THAN A WIFE AND BELIEVE SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE A BETTER WIFE TO A BETTER HUSBAND
LETTER 55._--THIS SAD LETTER FULLY DATED 18TH MARCH 1654 WAS WRITTEN AFTER SIR PETER OSBORNE WAS BURIED IN CAMPTON CHURCH
EVEN AS DOROTHY WROTE THIS THE STONE-MASON MIGHT BE SLOWLY CARVING WORDS THAT MAY BE READ TO THIS DAY
YET I NEVER SO MUCH AS TOOK THE LEAST NOTICE ON'T NOR HAD NOT NOW BUT FOR THIS OCCASION
I WOULD FAIN TELL YOU THOUGH THAT YOUR FATHER IS MISTAKEN AND THAT YOU ARE NOT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE ALL THE KINDNESS AND TENDERNESS FOR YOU MY HEART IS CAPABLE OF
WHEREAS IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE AS ALL WHO HAVE MADE ANY HISTORICAL RESEARCHES CAN ATTEST TO READ BALE AFTER BALE OF DESPATCHES AND PROTOCOLS WITHOUT CATCHING ONE GLIMPSE OF LIGHT ABOUT THE RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS
SHALL WE GO THITHER
AT THE RESTORATION SHE RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH HER HUSBAND AND EMPLOYED HER TIME IN WRITING LETTERS PLAYS POEMS PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSES AND ORATIONS
IT WAS AS YOU SAY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP AND MUCH FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR SEX
IN ONE INSTANCE IN A COMEDY ENTITLED LOVE'S CONVERT 1651 IT IS ALTERED TO LEAD AN APE IN HEAVEN MANY WILL REMEMBER THE FATE OF THE YOUNG MARY ANNE IN THE FAMOUS INGOLDSBY LEGEND BLOUDIE JACKE SO THEY SAY SHE IS NOW LEADING APES BLOUDIE JACK AND MENDS BACHELORS SMALLCLOTHES BELOW
TIS GREAT PITY HERE IS ROOM FOR NO MORE BUT YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO WITH ALL MY LETTERS
AND IN EARNEST THE WANT OF EXAMPLES TO BRING FOR THE CONTRARY PUZZLED ME A LITTLE SO THAT I WAS FAIN TO BRING OUT THOSE PITIFUL VERSES OF MY LORD BIRON TO HIS WIFE WHICH WAS SO POOR AN ARGUMENT THAT I WAS E'EN ASHAMED ON'T MYSELF AND HE QUICKLY LAUGHED ME OUT OF COUNTENANCE WITH SAYING THEY WERE JUST SUCH AS A MARRIED MAN'S FLAME WOULD PRODUCE AND A WIFE INSPIRE
HAVE I NOT REASON THEN TO DESIRE THIS FROM YOU
I HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT GIVES ME THE LEAST DESIRE OF PRESERVING MYSELF BUT THE OPINION I HAVE YOU WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO LOSE ME
EARLY IN THE YEAR 1695 AFTER FORTY YEARS OF MARRIED LIFE AND IN THE SIXTY-SEVENTH YEAR OF HER AGE SHE DIED
YOU DID NOT TELL ME WHAT CARRIED YOU OUT OF TOWN IN SUCH HASTE
I HAVE SOME REASON TO DOUBT THAT IT ALTERS PEOPLE STRANGELY
THIS INNOCENT CREATURE IS SACRIFICED TO THE VERIEST BEAST THAT EVER WAS
YOUR FELLOW-SERVANT KISSES YOUR HANDS AND SAYS IF YOU MEAN TO MAKE LOVE TO HER OLD WOMAN THIS IS THE BEST TIME YOU CAN TAKE FOR SHE IS DYING
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF GREAT BEAUTY BUT OF FAR GREATER PARTS
SHE LIVES NEAR THEM IN ESSEX AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD FOR WANT OF OTHER DISCOURSE TO ENTERTAIN HIM WITHAL SHE HAS COME OUT WITH ALL SHE KNOWS
DOROTHY WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO VAPOUR FOR MONTHS ABOUT AN EARLY AND A QUIET GRAVE WHEN SHE WRITES THIS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE DEEPEST EARNEST OF DESPAIR
I SHOULD THINK ALL PEOPLE THAT LOOKED ON ME READ IT IN MY FACE AND DESPISED ME IN THEIR HEARTS
I ALWAYS SPEAK MY HEART TO YOU
GENERAL MONK'S BROTHER TO WHOM DOROTHY REFERS WAS MR NICHOLAS MONK VICAR OF KELKHAMPTON IN CORNWALL
HE HAS CERTAINLY AS GREAT A KINDNESS FOR HER AS CAN BE AND TO SAY TRUTH NOT WITHOUT REASON
AND IT MAY BE HE WOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT THEM
FOR TRUST ME IF YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MY FACE BETTER I AM SATISFIED IT SHOULD BE AS IT IS
YET YOU SHALL SEE I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SATISFY YOU UPON CONDITION YOU WILL TELL ME WHY YOU QUARRELLED SO AT YOUR LAST LETTER
BUT I DOUBTED THE FIRST EXTREMELY
TIS ONE TALBOT THE FINEST GENTLEMAN HE HAS SEEN THIS SEVEN YEARS
CAN WE WONDER THEN THAT DOROTHY LONELY AND UNAIDED PACING IN THE DAMP GARDEN BENEATH THE BARE TREES WITH ALL THE BRIGHT SUMMER CHANGED INTO DECAY LOST FAITH AND HOPE
THEY ARE MY DEAR LADY DIANA'S AND THEREFORE I AM MUCH CONCERNED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SAFE
I AM WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE STORY YOU MENTION AND AM CONFIDENT YOU ARE NOT WELL INFORM'D FOR TIS IMPOSSIBLE SHE SHOULD EVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING THAT WERE UNHANDSOME
LETTER 59._--IT IS A LITTLE ASTONISHING TO READ AS ONE DOES IN THIS AND THE LAST LETTER OF RACE MEETINGS AND DOROTHY HABITED IN A MASK DISPORTING HERSELF AT NEW SPRING GARDENS OR IN THE PARK
THE STRANGE REVOLUTION WE HAVE SEEN MIGHT WELL HAVE TAUGHT ME WHAT THIS WORLD IS YET IT SEEMS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD HAVE A NEAR EXAMPLE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF ALL HUMAN BLESSINGS THAT SO HAVING NO TIE TO THE WORLD I MAY THE BETTER PREPARE MYSELF TO LEAVE IT
THAT IS PRESUMING IT TO BE THE SAME PLOT AND THAT LORD DORCHESTER IS ONE OF THE MANY PERSONS ARRESTED UNDER SUSPICION OF BEING CONCERNED IN IT
I NEVER DESERVED A LONG LETTER SO MUCH AS NOW WHEN YOU SENT ME A SHORT ONE
IS THERE ANYTHING THOUGHT SO INDISCREET OR THAT MAKES ONE MORE CONTEMPTIBLE
THERE IS A CRISP ETCHING OF THE HOUSE IN FISHER'S COLLECTIONS OF BEDFORDSHIRE
PRAY SEND ME A PAIR
MANCHESTER OCTOBER 1888
NOW IN VERY GOOD EARNEST DO YOU THINK TIS TIME FOR ME TO COME OR NO
THEY SAY YOU ARE VERY LIKE HIM
BUT HE MADE NO GOOD RETURN FOR THE COUNSEL I GAVE YOU TO SAY THAT THERE MIGHT COME A TIME WHEN MY KINDNESS MIGHT FAIL
OR HOW CAN YOU PERSUADE ME TO A CURE OF MYSELF WHEN YOU REFUSE TO GIVE ME THE EXAMPLE
SHE IS ALONE IN THE OLD HOUSE WITH HER DYING FATHER AND WITH HER BROTHER POURING HIS UNKIND GOSSIP INTO HER UNWILLING EAR WHILST THE SAD LONG YEAR DRAWS SLOWLY TO ITS CLOSE AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF BETTER FORTUNE FOR THE LOVERS
CAN THERE BE ANYTHING VAINER THAN SUCH A HOPE UPON SUCH GROUNDS
SETTING SAIL FROM PLYMOUTH WITH ONE HUNDRED HONEST MEN ON OCTOBER 26 1653 OR VERY SOON AFTERWARDS AS ONE MAY READ IN HIS JOURNAL OF THE PROGRESS OF THE EMBASSY
FOR EXAMPLE NOW I HAD RATHER AGREE TO WHAT YOU SAY THAN TELL YOU THAT DR TAYLOR WHOSE DEVOTE YOU MUST KNOW I AM SAYS THERE IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED IN RESIGNING UP ONE'S WILL TO THE COMMAND OF ANOTHER BECAUSE THE SAME ACTION WHICH IN ITSELF IS WHOLLY INDIFFERENT IF DONE UPON OUR OWN CHOICE BECOMES AN ACT OF DUTY AND RELIGION IF DONE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COMMAND OF ANY PERSON WHOM NATURE THE LAWS OR OURSELVES HAVE GIVEN A POWER OVER US
MY ELDEST BROTHER GOES UP TO TOWN ON MONDAY TOO
AND UPON THE DISCOVERY OF SOME LETTERS THAT HER MOTHER INTERCEPTED SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE PERSUADED THAT TWENTY-THREE HUNDRED POUND A YEAR WAS BETTER THAN TWELVE HUNDRED THOUGH WITH A PERSON SHE LOVED
I MET WITH SOMEBODY ELSE TOO IN'T THAT MAY CONCERN ANYBODY THAT HAS A MIND TO MARRY
BUT NO I SAW YOU
MY FELLOW-WATCHERS HAVE BEEN ASLEEP TOO TILL JUST NOW THEY BEGIN TO STRETCH AND YAWN
I HAVE SENT YOU ANOTHER TOME OF CYRUS PRAY SEND THE FIRST TO MR HOLLINGSWORTH FOR MY LADY
BUT HE WOULD NEVER YIELD TO THAT BECAUSE HE SAID UPON YOUR SILENCE HE SHOULD SUSPECT ALL WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE WELL BETWEEN US AND THEN HE WAS SURE I SHOULD NOT BE IN CONDITION TO BE ALONE
THINK ON'T AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU RESOLVE
YET I WILL HOPE YOURS MAY BE SO GOOD AS TO OVERCOME THE ILL OF MINE AND SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO MEND MY OWN ALL I CAN BY STRIVING TO DESERVE IT MAYBE BETTER
NOR HOW PLEASED I SHOULD BE FOR YOUR SAKE IF I WERE ABLE TO MAKE GOOD THE CHARACTER YOU GIVE ME TO YOUR BROTHER AND THAT I DID NOT OWE A GREAT PART OF IT WHOLLY TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SINCE YOU WENT WORTH YOUR KNOWLEDGE
AFTER THEIR RETIREMENT TO SHEEN AND MOOR PARK SURREY WE KNOW NOTHING DISTINCTIVELY OF LADY TEMPLE AND LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THEIR FAMILY LIFE
AND YOU MAY CONFESS THAT I AM A KIND AUNT TO DESIRE HER COMPANY SINCE THE DISADVANTAGE OF OUR BEING TOGETHER WILL LIE WHOLLY UPON ME
HE SAT AWHILE IN GREAT DISORDER WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD AND SO RIS AND TOOK HIS LEAVE
I MAKE IT NONE I ASSURE YOU
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY INGREDIENTS MUST GO TO THE MAKING ME HAPPY IN A HUSBAND
DESPONDENCY
HE RESUMED HIS OFFICE OF MASTER OF THE ROLLS AND IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR WAS ELECTED TO THE IRISH PARLIAMENT AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS FOR LEITRIM SLIGO AND ROSCOMMON
BUT I HAVE NO OTHER BUSINESS THAT IS WORTH MY TAKING A JOURNEY FOR I HAVE HAD ANOTHER SUMMONS FROM MY AUNT AND I PROTEST I AM AFRAID I SHALL BE IN REBELLION THERE
YET YOU HELPED TO DO IT
HE WAS IN THE SAME HOUSE WHERE I LAY AND I HAD TAKEN A GREAT FANCY TO HIM UPON WHAT WAS TOLD ME OF HIM AND WHAT I SAW
BUT HE THAT SAW HIMSELF DISCOVERED TOOK THAT TIME TO CONFESS TO ME IN A WHISPERING VOICE THAT I COULD HARDLY HEAR MYSELF THAT THE LETTER AS MY LORD BROGHILL SAYS WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO HIM AND BEGGED I WOULD READ IT AND GIVE HIM MY ANSWER
IF NOTHING WE ARE BUT WHERE WE WERE AND NOTHING CAN HINDER US FROM BEING AT LEAST PERFECT FRIENDS
AND SIR TOBY MATTHEW SPEAKS OF HER AS TOO LOFTY AND DIGNIFIED TO BE CAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP AND HAVING TOO GREAT A HEART TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF LOVE,"--AN EXTRAVAGANCE OF COMPLIMENT HARDLY SATISFACTORY IN THIS PLAIN AGE
AND AS A CERTAIN KING THAT MY LEARNED KNIGHT IS VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH WHO SEEING ONE OF HIS CONFEDERATES IN SO HAPPY A CONDITION AS IT WAS NOT LIKELY TO LAST SENT HIS AMBASSADOR PRESENTLY TO BREAK OFF THE LEAGUE BETWIXT THEM LEST HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO MOURN THE CHANGE OF HIS FORTUNE IF HE CONTINUED HIS FRIEND
YOU WILL NOT OFFER TO TAKE IT ILL THAT I EMPLOY YOU IN SUCH A COMMISSION SINCE I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THE GENERAL'S SON DID NOT REFUSE IT
HOW FAIN I WOULD SAY MORE
A GENTLEMAN THAT SERVES THE GENERAL SENT THEM ME
IF NOTHING OF ILL BE THE CAUSE I AM CONTENTED
I WILL NOT TELL YOU HOW MANY THIS JOURNEY CAUSES
HE SAID THE SEAT WAS AS ILL AS SO GOOD A COUNTRY WOULD PERMIT AND THE HOUSE SO RUINED FOR WANT OF LIVING IN'T AS IT WOULD ASK A GOOD PROPORTION OF TIME AND MONEY TO MAKE IT FIT FOR A WOMAN TO CONFINE HERSELF TO
AND INDEED MY BROTHER IS SO PERPETUALLY FROM HOME THAT I CAN BE VERY LITTLE UNLESS I WOULD LEAVE MY FATHER ALTOGETHER ALONE WHICH WOULD NOT BE WELL
AND TO INDUCE YOU TO IT LET ME TELL YOU FREELY THAT I DESERVE YOU SHOULD
THE GENERAL SAID TO HARRISON PUT HIM OUT HARRISON SPAKE TO SYDNEY TO GO OUT BUT HE SAID HE WOULD NOT GO OUT AND WAITED STILL
PRAY BE MERCIFUL AND LET IT RUN FRIENDSHIP IN MY NEXT CHARGE
THE WHOLE STORY IS VERY GOOD
DOROTHY MAY HAVE READ THE STORY IN ONE OF THE FRENCH TRANSLATIONS EITHER THAT OF PIERRE SALIAT A CRAMPED DUODECIMO PUBLISHED IN 1580 OR THAT OF P
AND IF YOUR FATHER PLEASE TO MAKE UP THE REST I KNOW NOTHING THAT IS LIKE TO HINDER ME FROM BEING YOURS
BEFORE I HAVE QUITE ENDED WITH HIM COMING TO TOWN ABOUT THAT AND SOME OTHER OCCASIONS OF MY OWN I FELL IN SIR THOMAS'S WAY
TIS LONG SINCE WE RESOLVED TO HAVE GIVEN YOU A VISIT AND HAVE RELIEVED YOU OF MY DAUGHTER
AND YET FOR ALL THIS ON MY CONSCIENCE WE SHALL NEVER MARRY
HE INSTANCED IN THE WIDOW THAT IT MADE ONE RESPECTED IN THE WORLD
MAY NOT I ASK IT
WOULD YOUR HORSE HAD LOST ALL HIS LEGS INSTEAD OF A HOOF THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU FURTHER AND YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU VALUED EXTREMELY AND COULD NOT HOPE TO FIND ANYWHERE BUT AT CHICKSANDS
THIS WILL ASSIST US TO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DOROTHY TOM CHEEKE AND LORD MANCHESTER
SIR,--YOU HAVE MADE ME SO RICH AS I AM ABLE TO HELP MY NEIGHBOURS
THEREFORE TIS EASIEST TO FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER
TIS NO VANITY THIS BUT A TRUE SENSE OF HOW PURE AND HOW REFINED A NATURE MY PASSION IS WHICH NONE CAN EVER KNOW EXCEPT MY OWN HEART UNLESS YOU FIND IT OUT BY BEING THERE
LADY SUNDERLAND WAS THE SACHARISSA OF WALLER THE POET
ONLY MY LADY GREW KIND AT PARTING AND SAID INDEED IF TOM PAUNTON AND J
BAGSHAWE IS EDWARD BAGSHAWE THE ELDER B.A
NOTHING BUT DEATH OR A DEAD PALSY IN MY HANDS OR SOMETHING THAT HAD THE SAME EFFECT
THE JOURNEY TO IRELAND WAS MADE VIA HOLYHEAD IN THOSE DAYS AS IT IS NOW
MY WHOLE LIFE WILL NOT YIELD SUCH ANOTHER OCCASION TO LET YOU SEE AT WHAT RATE I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND I HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER THAN MY WORD IN DOING BUT WHAT I PROMISED YOU SINCE I HAVE FOUND IT A MUCH HARDER THING NOT TO YIELD TO THE POWER OF A NEAR RELATION AND A GREATER KINDNESS THAN I COULD THEN IMAGINE IT
WAS IT TRUE AS COURTENAY THINKS THAT JEALOUSY OF KING WILLIAM'S ATTACHMENT TO TEMPLE DISTURBED THE EPISCOPAL EQUIPOISE OF SOUL RENDERING HIS LORDSHIP SLANDEROUS EVEN A BACKBITER
HE THEN APPEARS TO HAVE COME UP TO LONDON LEAVING HIS FATHER IN A DEBTOR'S PRISON AND PROCEEDED IN PURSUIT OF FORTUNE WITH A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES AND SEVEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE IN HIS POCKET
SHE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A LOVER OF LITERATURE AND FRANCIS QUARLES AND SIR HENRY WOTTON WERE HER INTIMATE FRIENDS
IF I HAD DONE SO I HAD MISSED A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION WHICH I RECEIVED FROM IT
VERY COURTLY AND SUPERIOR PERSONS ARE SOME OF THESE AND FAR REMOVED FROM OUR WORLD
I DURST MAKE HIM MY CONFESSOR THOUGH HE IS NOT OBLIGED BY HIS ORDERS TO CONCEAL ANYTHING THAT IS TOLD HIM
BUT DO IT SINCERELY AND DO NOT HELP YOUR PASSION TO MASTER YOU
IF I REMEMBER WHAT WAS TOLD ME ON'T THE WORST OF MY FAULTS WAS A HEIGHT HE WOULD NOT CALL IT PRIDE THAT WAS AS HE HAD HEARD THE HUMOUR OF MY FAMILY
TIS RATHER THAT YOU LOVE TO HEAR ME SAY IT OFTEN THAN THAT YOU DOUBT IT
IN SHADOWY OUTLINES IN DIMMER AND DIMMER CROWDING FORMS THE VERY FIGURE OF THE OLD DEAD TIME ITSELF MAY PERHAPS BE FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE HERE WITH THIS I FEEL THAT I MAY CAST OFF SOME OF THE FORMS AND SOLEMNITIES NECESSARY TO AN EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION AND ASSUMING A SIMPLER AND MORE PERSONAL PRONOUN ASK THE READER WHO SHALL FEEL THE FULL CHARM OF DOROTHY'S BRIGHT WIT AND TENDER WOMANLY SYMPATHY TO REMEMBER THE THANKS DUE TO MY FELLOW-SERVANT WHOSE PATIENT SINGLE-HEARTED TOIL HAS PLACED THESE LETTERS WITHIN OUR REACH
IF IT BE ONE I AM TOO GUILTY ON'T MYSELF TO ACCUSE ANOTHER
AND THIS WAS THE BEST OF HIM
I HUMBLY THANKED HER BUT SAID I WAS CERTAIN HE WOULD NOT MAKE THAT KIND OF HUSBAND I LOOKED FOR,--AND SO IT WENT NO FURTHER
NO LET IT BE RATHER WHAT IN EARNEST IF I CAN TELL ANYTHING I HAVE LEFT THAT IS CONSIDERABLE ENOUGH TO EXPOSE FOR IT IT MUST BE THAT SMALL REPUTATION I HAVE AMONGST MY FRIENDS THAT'S ALL MY WEALTH AND THAT I COULD PART WITH TO RESTORE YOU TO THAT QUIET YOU LIVED IN WHEN I FIRST KNEW YOU
BUT HE CONFIDENT STILL SAID TWAS PERHAPS THAT I HAD NO FANCY TO THEIR PERSONS AS IF HIS OWN WERE SO TAKING THAT I WAS TO BE LOOKED UPON AS ONE THAT HAD IT IN MY POWER TO PLEASE MYSELF AND THAT PERHAPS IN A PERSON I LIKED WOULD BATE SOMETHING OF FORTUNE
I SAW HER WHEN I WAS LAST IN TOWN BUT SHE APPEAR'D WHOLLY THE SAME TO ME SHE WAS AT ST MALO WITH ALL HER INNOCENT GOOD NATURE TOO AND ASKED FOR YOU SO KINDLY THAT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT HAVE FORGOT YOU
FAREWELL MAY YOU BE EVER HAPPY
I IMAGINE TWILL BE SO TO YOU FOR I AM SURE IT WOULD BE A GREAT ONE TO ME AND WE DO NOT USE TO DIFFER IN OUR INCLINATIONS THOUGH I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU THAT MY BROTHER'S KINDNESS TO ME HAS ANYTHING OF TROUBLE IN'T
LETTER 12 SIR,--THERE SHALL BE TWO POSTS THIS WEEK FOR MY BROTHER SENDS HIS GROOM UP AND I AM RESOLVED TO MAKE SOME ADVANTAGE OF IT
AND AS YOU VERY WELL OBSERVE THERE ARE SO MANY THAT THINK THEMSELVES WISE WHEN NOTHING EQUALS THEIR FOLLY BUT THEIR PRIDE THAT I DREAD NOTHING SO MUCH AS DISCOVERING SUCH A THOUGHT IN MYSELF BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT
WHICH HATH VEXT ME THE MORE IN REGARD I HAVE BEEN DETAINED FROM THE DESIRE I HAD OF BEING WITH YOU BEFORE THIS TIME
LET ME ASSURE YOU WHATEVER YOUR FATHER THINKS THAT HAD YOU L20,000 A YEAR I COULD LOVE YOU NO MORE THAN I DO AND SHOULD BE FAR FROM SHOWING IT SO MUCH LEST IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE A DESIRE OF YOUR FORTUNE WHICH AS TO MYSELF I VALUE AS LITTLE AS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AND IN THIS AGE OF CHANGES
LOVE IS A TERRIBLE WORD AND I SHOULD BLUSH TO DEATH IF ANYTHING BUT A LETTER ACCUSED ME ON'T
NO I FIND IT IS NOT EASILY DONE AT MORE LEISURE AND I AM YET TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY THAT IS NOT TOO LITTLE NOR TOO MUCH
AND IN HIS OPINION HE SEES NOBODY THAT WOULD MAKE SO FIT A WIFE FOR HIM AS I
IF GOD HAD SEEN IT FIT TO HAVE SATISFIED OUR DESIRES WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THEM AND EVERYTHING WOULD NOT HAVE CONSPIRED THUS TO HAVE CROSSED THEM
INDEED IF I HAVE ANY STATELY LOOKS I THINK HE HAS SEEN THEM BUT YET IT SEEMS THEY COULD NOT KEEP HIM FROM PLAYING THE FOOL
FOR I NEVER SAW PEOPLE PERFORM WHAT THEY INTENDED WORSE AND COULD NOT FORBEAR TELLING THEM SO
A THOUSAND ACCIDENTS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ME FROM YOU AND YOU MUST HAVE BORNE IT
HE GIVES THEM SUCH PRECEPTS AS THEY SAY MY LORD OF DORCHESTER GIVES HIS WIFE AND KEEPS THEM SO MUCH PRISONERS TO A VILE HOUSE HE HAS IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE THAT IF BUT ONCE I HAD LET THEM LOOSE THEY AND HIS LEARNING WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO HAVE MADE HIM MAD WITHOUT MY HELP
SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH LILLY WHO MARRIED HER IN 1627 AND FOR FIVE YEARS UNTIL HER DEATH THEY LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER
YOU MAY ALLOW ME TO DREAM SOMETIMES
BUT THAT IS A GOOD FAULT AND COUNTED LUCKY BY SUPERSTITIOUS PEOPLE
IF IT DO NO GOOD TWILL BE SURE TO DO NO HARM AND TWILL BE NO GREAT TROUBLE TO TAKE A LITTLE ON'T NOW AND THEN
YOU WILL NOT TAKE IT ILL THAT I DESIRE IT SHOULD BE SOON
YET THAT YOU MAY NOT IMAGINE WE ARE QUITE OUT OF THE WORLD HERE AND SO BE FRIGHTED FROM COMING I CAN ASSURE YOU WE ARE SELDOM WITHOUT NEWS SUCH AS IT IS
FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US NOT MAKE AFFLICTIONS OF SUCH THINGS AS THESE
THE ODDNESS OF THE FIGURES MAKES THE BEAUTY OF THESE THINGS
THEY TELL ME I MUST TAKE THIS UGLY DRINK A FORTNIGHT AND THEN BEGIN ANOTHER AS BAD
MRS HUTCHINSON SPEAKING THE SENTIMENTS OF THE GRAVE AND AGED DESCRIBES HIM AS AN INSOLENT FOOLE AND A DEBAUCHED UNGODLY CAVALIER THESE EXPRESSIONS PROBABLY MEAN THAT HE WAS ONE WHO AMONG YOUNG AND DISSIPATED PEOPLE WOULD PASS FOR A FINE GENTLEMAN
BUT IF EVER THAT MAY BE OBTAINED OR I LEFT FREE AND YOU IN THE SAME CONDITION ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF FORTUNE OR PERSON IMAGINABLE MET TOGETHER IN ONE MAN SHOULD NOT BE PREFERRED BEFORE YOU
IF I HAD GONE ABOUT TO CONCEAL HIM I HAD BEEN SWEETLY SERV'D
I'LL E'EN TO BED AS SOON AS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I AM VERY MUCH YOUR FAITHFUL FRIEND AND SERVANT D
NOT BEING ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING I GOT HER TO CARDS AND THERE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PATIENCE LOST MY MONEY TO HER;--OR RATHER I GAVE IT AS MY RANSOM
BUT I AM AFRAID HE IS NOT
THAT IS IF HE STAYS WHICH I DON'T DOUBT BUT HE WILL BECAUSE ALL THE FINE LADIES WILL PETITION FOR HIM
AND BEFORE I COULD SAY A WORD TO YOU OR YOU TO ME THE DISORDER MY JOY TO SEE YOU HAD PUT ME INTO AWAKENED ME
BUT SAD ACCIDENTS HAVE WINGS TO OVERTAKE US AND COME IN FLOCKS LIKE ILL-BODING RAVENS
BESIDES THOUGH YOU IMAGINE TWERE A GREAT ARGUMENT OF MY KINDNESS TO CONSIDER NOTHING BUT YOU IN EARNEST I BELIEVE TWOULD BE AN INJURY TO YOU
THAT I SHALL ALWAYS BE WILLING TO DO
LINKED BY MARRIAGE TO THE GREAT FAMILIES OF THE LAND
AFTER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS THEY AWOKE BUT ONLY TO DIE SOON AFTERWARDS
AND AS IT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MANNERS OF THE DAY THE ACCOUNT IS HERE QUOTED AT LENGTH NEW EXCHANGE IN THE STRAND
YOURS
WHY SHOULD YOU BE LESS KIND
AND UPON THAT SCORE HIS VANITY ALLOWS HIM TO THINK HE MAY PRETEND AS FAR AS ANOTHER
THERE IS A LITTLE HEAD CUT IN AN ONYX THAT I TAKE TO BE A VERY GOOD ONE AND THE DOLPHIN IS AS YOU SAY THE BETTER FOR BEING CUT LESS
I AM NOT PARTIAL TO MYSELF I KNOW AND AM CONTENTED THAT THE PLEASURE I HAVE RECEIVED WITH THIS SHALL SERVE TO SWEETEN MANY SAD THOUGHTS THAT HAVE INTERPOSED SINCE YOUR LAST AND MORE THAT I MAY REASONABLY EXPECT BEFORE I HAVE ANOTHER
BUT MY LADY ISABELLA THAT SPEAKS AND LOOKS AND SINGS AND PLAYS AND ALL SO PRETTILY WHY CANNOT I SAY THAT SHE IS FREE FROM FAULTS AS HER SISTER BELIEVES HER
BUT PRAY HEREAFTER SEAL YOUR LETTERS SO THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF OPENING THEM MAY DISHEARTEN ANYBODY FROM ATTEMPTING IT
ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL NOT SATISFY HER
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT BUT I KNOW THERE IS NO FAULT OF YOURS IN'T
YOU OUGHT IN CHARITY TO WRITE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FOR IN EARNEST MY LIFE HERE SINCE MY FATHER'S SICKNESS IS SO SAD THAT TO ANOTHER HUMOUR THAN MINE IT WOULD BE UNSUPPORTABLE
IF YOUR EYES ARE BETTER YOU WILL FIND THAT I INTENDED TO ASSURE YOU I AM YOURS
BUT IF YOU PLEASE TO CONFIRM IT TO ME BY ANOTHER YOU KNOW HOW TO DIRECT IT FOR I AM WHERE I WAS STILL THE SAME AND ALWAYS YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT D
NOVEMBER 21._--IN THE EVENING THERE HAPPENED A QUARREL BETWEEN THE PORTUGAL AMBASSADOR'S BROTHER AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS OF THAT NATION WITH ONE MR GERARD AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WHOM THEY ALL FELL UPON
L'ILLUSTRE BASSA WAS A ROMANCE OF SCUDERI
BESIDES I HOPE THIS JOURNEY WILL BE OF ADVANTAGE TO US
SINCE I WRIT THIS MY COMPANY IS INCREASED BY TWO MY BROTHER HARRY AND A FAIR NIECE THE ELDEST OF MY BROTHER PEYTON'S CHILDREN
PRAY GOD IT BE NOT AN ILL OMEN
NOR IS IT EASY TO GUESS WHO IS WORTHY OF HER
BUT THE WIFE OF SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE CALLED FORTH THE SPIRIT OF DOROTHY OSBORNE
SIR,--THEY SAY YOU GAVE ORDER FOR THIS WASTE-PAPER
AND SHALL WITHOUT QUESTION LOVE YOU ETERNALLY BUT WHETHER WITH ANY SATISFACTION TO HERSELF OR YOU IS A SAD DOUBT
YET HE IS NOW I THANK GOD MUCH BETTER AND I AM COME SO MUCH TO MYSELF WITH IT AS TO UNDERTAKE A LONG LETTER TO YOU WHILST I WATCH BY HIM
THERE IS NO HONEST BIOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN MARSHALL
SIR,--THAT YOU MAY BE SURE IT WAS A DREAM THAT I WRIT THAT PART OF MY LETTER IN I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS I WRIT BUT SEEMS IT WAS VERY KIND AND POSSIBLY YOU OWE THE DISCOVERY ON'T TO MY BEING ASLEEP
A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION AS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LETTERS
TIS THE RESULT OF A LONG STRIFE WITH MYSELF BEFORE MY REASON COULD OVERCOME MY PASSION OR BRING ME TO A PERFECT RESIGNATION TO WHATSOEVER IS ALLOTTED FOR ME
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF SENDING YOU MY PICTURE TILL I COULD COME MYSELF
TIS ALL THE SERVICE I EXPECT FROM TWO GIRLS WHOSE FRIENDS HAVE GIVEN ME LEAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THAT SOME ORDER I MUST TAKE FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THEM MAY SERVE FOR MY PRETENCE TO SEE YOU
WHEN I HAVE SUPPED I GO INTO THE GARDEN AND SO TO THE SIDE OF A SMALL RIVER THAT RUNS BY IT WHEN I SIT DOWN AND WISH YOU WERE WITH ME YOU HAD BEST SAY THIS IS NOT KIND NEITHER IN EARNEST TIS A PLEASANT PLACE AND WOULD BE MUCH MORE SO TO ME IF I HAD YOUR COMPANY
AND TIS MOST CERTAIN THAT LET THE HUSBAND BE WHAT HE WILL IF THE WIFE HAVE BUT PATIENCE WHICH SURE BECOMES HER BEST THE DISORDER CANNOT BE GREAT ENOUGH TO MAKE A NOISE
AND WHEN THIS HOUSE BREAKS UP HE IS RESOLVED TO FOLLOW ME IF HE CAN WHICH HE THINKS HE MIGHT BETTER DO TO A HOUSE WHERE I HAD SOME POWER THAN WHERE I AM BUT UPON COURTESY MYSELF
