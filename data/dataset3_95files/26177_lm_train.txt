SHE SAW THE BOY SITTING WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED UNDER HIM ON THE GRASS CRYING AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM
NOW ALL THAT IT HELD WAS--ONE BROWN POTATO
DAT ZACKLY DE KINDER MAN WHAT BRER RABBIT IS
SKINNER
WAS HE TO STARVE TO DEATH
THE EMPEROR TOOK OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES AND THE MEN BUSIED THEMSELVES AS IF THEY WERE PUTTING ON VARIOUS GARMENTS WHILE MEANTIME THE EMPEROR SURVEYED HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR
THE DONKEY BRAYED THE DOG BARKED THE CAT MEWED THE ROOSTER CROWED
HIS FATHER WAS KING OVER ALL THE LAND AND HIS MOTHER WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL QUEEN THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN AND PRINCE HARWEDA WAS THEIR ONLY CHILD
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM NATHAN I DID NOT FIND HIM SAID THE BOY STILL HOLDING FAST HIS FATHER'S ARM
THERE STOOD THE SPIRITED STEED
BUT THEY WERE ALL TOO BUSY WITH THEIR JOKING TO NOTICE HIM
AT LAST THE KING GAVE BELLEROPHON HIS DAUGHTER AS A WIFE
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE GOOD WOMAN'S DISGUST WHEN SHE FOUND THE CART QUITE EMPTY
THE STREAM BECAME NARROWER AND NARROWER UNTIL AT LAST IT WAS NOT BROADER THAN HIS HAND
DUST UNDER THE RUG SAID THE LITTLE VOICE IN MINNIE'S HEART
I HAVE GOT MY BEAUTIFUL MONEY
OH A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME SAID JACK
THE FATAL NECKLACE GREW SHORTER AND SHORTER TILL IT CHOKED HER
THEY WOULD NOT LET ME KEEP IT
FIRST OF ALL WE ATE CORALIE STOPPED FOR THE CHILDREN WERE LAUGHING TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN THEIR CHEEKS
SHE TOLD FALSEHOODS
GO AND BRING ME MY AXE HAN CHUNG HAN CHUNG RAN FOR HIS FATHER'S AXE AND HO-SEEN-KO HIS LITTLE SISTER CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE WITH HIM
ROB SCREWED HIS KNUCKLES INTO HIS EYES AS A GENTLE HINT THAT THEY HAD BETTER NOT PLAY HIM ANY TRICKS AND THEN STARED WITH MIGHT AND MAIN
BUT THEY THOUGHT HE SAID
THEN HE LIFTED HIS KNIFE AND FORK TO CUT OFF A LARGE PIECE
WELL AFTER A WHILE IT BEGAN TO GET DARKER
BUT MERLIN STOPPED HER
WHY ARE YOU PANTING SO FRIEND ASKED THE DONKEY
HE WAS DISMAYED AND LAY FOR A LONG TIME THINKING OF WHAT HE HAD BEST DO WITH HIMSELF
YOU WILL NOT GIVE IT TO ME NO THAT I WON'T SHE LAY KICKING HER LEGS AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM AND THEN SHE SAID BUT IF I GIVE YOU A BUTTER-CAKE FOR THE GOAT CAN I HAVE HIM THEN OEYVIND CAME OF POOR PEOPLE AND HAD EATEN BUTTER-CAKE ONLY ONCE IN HIS LIFE
HE HASTENED AT ONCE TO A CERTAIN SPRING WHERE PEGASUS OFTEN CAME TO DRINK
BUT HOW CAN I GO SO FAR BROTHER WOLF ASKED
THAT DIP IS PERFECTLY HORRID SAID JULIA
HE LIKED BETTER TO BE AMONG THE BIG PEOPLE ON THE BYE-BYE MEADOW
TOMMY'S HOME
YES IT IS CHEAP SAID MOLLY
WHY DID YOU MAKE US WALK SO FAR
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BUY I DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUY IT MAY BE TISSUE PAPER OR IT MAY BE PAPER DOLLS FURNITURE OR IT MAY BE A NEW DRESS FOR SYLVIA OR JANE BUT WHATEVER IT IS IT MUST COST JUST SIXPENCE THEN MOLLY TOLD JULIA THE STORY OF THE EXCHANGE OF THE SILVER SIXPENCES
COME HERE THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE REACHED THE VILLAGE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS AS QUIET AS THE SNOW ITSELF
BY-AND-BY A MAN WITH A COVERED BASKET CAME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM
IF THOU HADST BUT WAITED FOR A LITTLE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINE FOR EVER MORE BUT NOW FAREWELL
SHE KNOWS OF MANY GOOD STORIES BUT THESE SAME STORIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGH MANY BOOKS AND THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY OF FINDING TIME IN HER ALREADY OVERCROWDED DAYS FOR FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE LIBRARY IS WELL-NIGH INSURMOUNTABLE
YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER CARRIES WITH HER A SURE GUARDIAN OF THE TRUTH THEN HE LOOKED STERNLY AT CORALIE AND SAID IN A YEAR I SHALL COME FOR MY NECKLACE
SHE WENT ON HER JOURNEY KEEPING HER EYES ON THE GROUND SO AS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE TRACKS OF THE THIEF BUT STILL CRYING FOR HER BEAUTIFUL MONEY
YES THIS CLOTH MUST BE WOVEN FOR ME AND HE GAVE THE MEN MUCH MONEY THAT THEY MIGHT BEGIN AT ONCE TO WEAVE THEIR CLOTH
NOW I WONDER WHAT THAT LITTLE CHAP WOULD LIKE--HERE'S A DRUM A BOX OF TOOLS A KNIFE A MENAGERIE
BUT LI'L HANNIBAL GOT AWAY FROM THEM ALL RIGHT
I WISH I COULD TRUST MY SERVANTS AS YOUR MASTER CAN TRUST YOU
THE DRY LEAVES FLUTTERED DOWN UPON THE ROAD WHERE THEY LAY IN DRIFTS
HE FORBADE THEM TO TOUCH THE WOLF
IF HE IS NOT CURED THEN WE SHALL TRY TWO MONTHS NEXT TIME
OH SHRIEKED KAT
FEW COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING OF HIS NEW KING THE SON OF MARY
BY NANNIE NIEMEYER
KNOWING NOTHING OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON THE OLD MAN DROVE ON UNTIL HE REACHED HIS COTTAGE
ASK BREAD AT ANOTHER DOOR THE OLD MAN'S BLUE EYES FLASHED WITH FIRE AS HE DREW HIMSELF UP PROUDLY
THE MOMENT YOU HEAR A RUMBLING AND A KNOCKING SAY
THEN HE SLID MERRILY DOWN BETWEEN THE ROCKS TO THE PLACE WHERE PETER AND PAUL WERE RESTING THEMSELVES
WHERE MAY YOU BE GOING ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
AND WHEN HE HAD DUG FOR HOURS AND HOURS SO THAT HE WAS TIRED TO DEATH THE POTATO-PLANT BEGAN SUDDENLY TO DWINDLE AND DWINDLE
HAVE YOU GOT BACK HE GOT UP TOOK IT BY THE TWO FORELEGS AND DANCED WITH IT AS IF IT WERE A BROTHER
HERE AND THERE WERE LITTLE FLAGS TO POINT OUT PLACES WHERE BATTLES HAD BEEN FOUGHT DURING THE YEAR
LANE LITTLE NATHAN KING WAS DRIVING HOME HIS FATHER'S COWS
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL
BUT WHEN I FOUND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO DROWN ME AWAY I RAN AS FAST AS MY FOUR LEGS COULD CARRY ME
WHEN HE GIT MOS DAR HE STOP EN TELL DE LITTLE RABS FER STAY BACK DAR OUT ER SIGHT EN WAIT TWEL HE CALL UM FO DEY COME
THE KING OF LYCIA WELCOMED BELLEROPHON TO HIS COURT
TO LIVE IN THE BYE-BYE MEADOW WAS SOMETIMES A DANGEROUS THING FOR ALL THE BIG PEOPLE LIVED THERE
OH DEAR HOP-ABOUT MAN HE CRIED DO TELL EVERYTHING TO BE QUIET AGAIN PLEASE FOR I CAN HEAR THE WALLS OF MY FINE HOUSE SHAKING BUT THE HOP-ABOUT MAN WHO WAS AGAIN SITTING IN HIS CHAIR REPLIED
ASSEMBLE SET TO WORK AND WEAVE ME A SILK CARPET SUCH AS I WAS WONT TO SIT UPON AT MY DEAR FATHER'S NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
THE BOY STOPPED WITH THE LAST BIT IN HIS MOUTH THE GIRL LAY AND LAUGHED AND THE GOAT STOOD BY HER SIDE WITH WHITE BREAST AND DARK BROWN HAIR LOOKING SIDEWAYS DOWN
HE NEXT CREPT THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW TO A LADDER HE HAD PLACED THERE DOWN WHICH HE RAN AS NIMBLY AS A SQUIRREL
WELL WELL WELL EXCLAIMED HIS GODMOTHER WHEN THEY LAID THE CASE BEFORE HER THIS IS A PRETTY STATE OF AFFAIRS
I AM READY SAID THE EMPEROR
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY SOON A BRIGHT IDEA CAME TO HER AND SHE SHOUTED TO HER HUSBAND
EACH TIME THAT YOU RUB HIS WOOL OUT WILL DROP A GOLD-PIECE
BUT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD PORK VERY OFTEN
YOUR SILVER CHAIN
ITS SONG SEEMED TO SAY
A KISS AND HE WAS GONE
BUT THEY DID NOT LOOK UP AND BY-AND-BY WANG CHIH GOT SO INTERESTED IN THE GAME THAT HE PUT DOWN HIS AXE AND SAT ON THE FLOOR TO WATCH IT BETTER
FATHER WON'T BE IN TIME TO LIGHT THEM FOR US AFTER ALL HAN CHUNG WAS SAYING
WHEN SHE HAD TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE THOUGHT THAT NOBODY LIVED THERE
I DON'T LIKE YOU
BUT I HAVEN'T ANY MONEY
SO THAT THE WHOLE YEAR WAS A ROUND OF DELIGHT TO THE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
HIS BLUE EYES WERE KIND BUT VERY KEEN
THEY CUT NOTHING WITH HUGE SCISSORS SEWED WITH NEEDLES WITHOUT THREAD AND AT LAST SAID THE CLOTHES ARE FINISHED THE EMPEROR CAME HIMSELF WITH HIS FAVOURITES AND EACH IMPOSTOR HELD UP HIS ARMS AS IF HE WERE SHOWING SOMETHING AND SAID SEE
CHEEP
CHEEP
BUT THOUGH HE HAD GROWN SO GREAT AND FAMOUS AILBE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HIS SECOND MOTHER THE GOOD WOLF NOR HIS FOUR-FOOTED BROTHERS IN THEIR COATS OF GREY FUR
VERY SOON THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LIGHT SHONE
BUT THE BISHOP HIMSELF WAS NOT WITH THEM
HE THOUGHT HIS MASTER HAD STRUCK HIM AND WAS FURIOUS WITH PAIN AND ANGER
HE LOW HEYO HOUSE
OF COURSE HE COULD GO
I SEEK SATAN NOW
HE WAS STILL PONDERING HOW TO TRANSFER THEM TO THE SURFACE WHEN SOME WOMEN CAME TO FILL THEIR WATER JARS
I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE A DIP TO DECIDE IT MEANWHILE A MORE IMPORTANT CUSTOMER HAD COME IN WITH WHOM THE ASSISTANT WAS BUSY SO MOLLY WENT OVER TO HER AND HANDED HER THE SIXPENCE
NOBLEMAN FOOTNOTE 18
WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH THE OAK THE KING WANTS IT CUT DOWN SAID JACK
GRANDFATHER AND KIT AND KAT CLIMBED THE DYKE
THE STORIES IN THE PRESENT COLLECTION ARE DRAWN FROM MANY NATIONS AND FROM WIDELY DIFFERING SOURCES
I AM HAPPIER THAN IF I HAD LIVED TO BE A FIERCE WARRIOR WITH SCALPS AT MY BELT
MA-LO MA-LO!_"[2 FOOTNOTE 2
YOU CAN HEAR HER TAPPING HER BEAK ON THE TREE-TRUNKS AS SHE HUNTS FOR FOOD
THE SMALL PINK MARBLE PALACE SHOOK FROM TOP TO BOTTOM THE IRON DOOR FLEW OPEN AND THE FRESH WIND FROM THE SEA RUSHED IN AND SEEMED TO CATCH THE BOY IN ITS INVISIBLE ARMS
I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED CHOPPING AT THAT OLD TREE ALL BY YOURSELF AH MASTER SAID THE AXE
YOU MUST THROW THEM IN GENTLY THUD THUD THUD SO OH-I-AM HELD BACK HIS ANGER AND HE THREW THE POTATOES IN GENTLY THUD THUD THUD
WHAT HAST THOU DONE
GOOD-BYE LITTLE BLUE SHOES HE SAID BUT THE HOP-ABOUT MAN DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE
GRANDPAPA DOES TOO YOU CAN BELIEVE YES BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT MOTHER DOES GRANDPAPA KNOWS ONE ABOUT A DANCE
NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED THE FOX
ARE YOU AFRAID OF THAT CROSS MY MASTER SATAN WAS SILENT
THIS IS THE REASON THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTH COUNTRIES LOVE THE ROBIN AND ARE NEVER TIRED OF TELLING THEIR CHILDREN HOW ITS BREAST BECAME RED
THE KING HAS SAID IT AND IT SHALL BE DONE
THOSE MUST INDEED BE SPLENDID CLOTHES THOUGHT THE EMPEROR
WE WALKED AND WE STAYED THERE ONLY FIVE MINUTES THE NECKLACE SHRANK AT ONCE TO ITS PROPER SIZE
THEN THE CAPTAIN SAID TO THE OLD FARMER
THEN HE SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH AND AGAIN BEGAN SHARPENING HIS KNIFE
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT HIM HE SAID AGAIN
BUT SEE HIS LONG WHITE BEARD--CAN HE BE OLD
BUT HE HAS A YOUNG HEART--THIS DEAR OLD MAN,--AND A KIND ONE
HOW BECOMING THAT WOULD BE TO SYLVIA
SHE WAS NOT A POOR OLD WOMAN
GET INTO MY SATCHEL SAID TEENCHY DUCK AND I'LL TRY TO CARRY YOU IT ISN'T BIG ENOUGH SAID BROTHER FOX
YOU ARE RIGHT MY MASTER
HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND TO GET SOME FRUIT TO EAT BUT ONLY ONE OR TWO WITHERED APPLES REMAINED ON THE TABLE
WITH HIM WERE SOME FRIENDS OF HIS WHO WERE ALSO LAWYERS
THE WISE MAN SAID
THINK OF FIFTY GREAT ROCKING-HORSES IN A PILE
THEN THEIR FATHER SAID TO THEM BOYS I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF YOU THESE MANY DAYS WHEN YOU WERE TOO LITTLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES
TO ENGLAND AND AMERICA AND CHINA AND ALL OVER THE WORLD SAID GRANDFATHER
AT LAST HE HEARD OR THOUGHT HE HEARD A FAINT SOUND
HIS FOES WERE SLAIN OR SCATTERED
BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING ELSE FAR BETTER SAID CHRIF I HAVE FOUND HOME THE FROG-TSAREVNA_[16 R
LITTLE STORIES TO TELL THREE HUNDRED STORIES
THEN I CAN HAVE TWO OF THEM JULIA
AND YOU MR BUNNY GO AND INVITE THE FOX AND THE CAT TO DINNER SO THEY MADE EVERYTHING READY AS THE BEAR HAD SAID AND THE HARE RAN OFF TO INVITE THE GUESTS
WHEN YOU ARE A FEW YEARS OLDER WE SHALL HAVE A PRETTY WEDDING IN THE PALACE
JUMP ON MY BACK LITTLE BROTHER HE SAID AND I WILL CARRY YOU HOME THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE FOX HAD BEEN SCHEMING FOR AND THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT ERE HE HAD TAKEN A COMFORTABLE SEAT
IN THE STABLE TEENCHY DUCK STOOD ALONE SINGING IN HER MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE
THAT IS THE BEST PART OF HIM--SO ROUND AND SO RUDDY SUCH TWINKLING EYES AND SUCH A MERRY LOOK ABOUT THOSE DIMPLES
HE TELLS IT ON THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS WHEN THE WINDS WHISTLE THROUGH THE PINES AND HE TELLS IT IN THE SUMMER TO THE TRAVELLERS AS THEY CLIMB THE MOUNTAINS
THEY ARE ALL GONE NOW BUT IT WAS FUN WHILE THEY LASTED
AND WHEN HE HAD CONSIDERED AWHILE HE SET OFF FOR THE HOUSE OF THE GREEN OGRE SHAKING IN HIS SHOES
SEERS
SEERS
THEY SAT ON THEM INSTEAD
YES WHAT OF THAT GROWLED PAUL
HE WAS HOLDING HIS FATHER'S ARM WITH BOTH HANDS
AND HE ROLLED UP HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES AND SWUNG HIS BIG ARMS AROUND TILL THEIR MUSCLES STOOD OUT LIKE WHIPCORDS
GO DOWN INTO YOUR VILLAGE AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE YOU LEFT IT THE SAD CONSEQUENCES SO WANG CHIH WENT DOWN AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND FOUND THE FIELDS WHERE HE HAD WORKED COVERED WITH HOUSES AND A BUSY TOWN WHERE HIS OWN LITTLE VILLAGE HAD BEEN
AH
HE SET TO WORK AND MADE THE OX OF STRAW AND SMEARED IT ALL OVER WITH TAR
SUDDENLY THEIR GAY TALK WAS INTERRUPTED
ABOUT NOON THE BOYS CAME TO A PLEASANT BROOK
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING HALF SO FINE BEFORE
SURE ENOUGH THE WATER HAD ONCE MORE FROZEN OVER BUT FINDING A HOLE HE THRUST IN HIS TAIL AND RAMMED IT THROUGH AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT TILL THE FISH SHOULD COME
SO WANG CHIH WAITED IN THE STREET
WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND YOUNG AND FEEBLE THOU DIDST NOURISH AND CHERISH AND PROTECT ME
FINDING THIS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE THE WATER HAD FROZEN FAST AROUND IT HE CONGRATULATED HIMSELF ON HAVING CAUGHT SO MANY FISH THAT THEIR WEIGHT PREVENTED HIM FROM LIFTING HIS TAIL
BY THE FAINT LIGHT OF THE MOON THEY SAW THE POT OF GOLD
HE PUT IT IN THE LUNCH-BASKET TO CARRY HOME
AND LOOK AT THE TOWELS AND THE LITTLE TOWEL-RACK SAID MOLLY
CONFESS NOW OLD ABE HE SAID WASN'T IT THOSE YOUNG ROBINS THAT KEPT YOU WE KNOW YOU OLD FELLOW SAID ANOTHER
BOUT DAT TIME BRER WOLF TUCK A NOTION DAT EF BRER RABBIT KIN OUTDO OLE BRER LION HE CAN'T OUTDO HIM

YOU SHALL HAVE IT RHOECUS REPLIED THE DRYAD SADLY
HE SAID ALOUD WHAT HE HAD OFTEN THOUGHT MY WORK IS OVER MY ENEMIES ARE DEAD
WHEN HE SAW HOW TIRED AND SLEEPY THE LITTLE BOY WAS HE CAME CLOSER TO THE FIRE AND LAUGHED TO HIMSELF
OF WHOLE FLOCKS OF WOOLLY SHEEP AND CURLY DOGS WITH THE REAL BARK IN THEM
BUT WANG CHIH DID NOT TELL THEM HIS ADVENTURES JUST THEN
I WILL LET YOU HAVE IT FOR SIXPENCE SEEING THAT IT IS YOU THE GIRL SAID
FATHER HE WHISPERED I CANNOT BEAR THIS
HE WILL STARVE IF HE STAYS THERE AND HE WILL BE KILLED IF HE TRIES TO CLIMB DOWN THEY SAID SADLY
WHY GET INTO MY SATCHEL SAID TEENCHY DUCK AND I'LL CARRY YOU THE BEST I KNOW HOW THE LADDER WAS SOON IN THE SATCHEL WITH BROTHER FOX AND BROTHER WOLF AND TEENCHY DUCK WENT ON HER WAY FOLLOWING THE TRACKS OF THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS AND ALWAYS CRYING
RHODA WAS WATERING THE FLOWERS IN THE DEAR OLD BOAT
COMPANIES OF FIREMEN DRAWING THEIR HOSE-CARTS
F
F
THEN THEY WENT TO BED
HE LONGED TO PUT IT OUT BUT HE DID NOT DARE FOR HE FEARED THE HUNTER'S ARROWS
MOO
THEY WENT ON AND ON UNTIL THEY CAME ALL AT ONCE TO A SORT OF OPEN SPACE IN THE WOODS AND THEN THEY STOPPED
AND WHERE DIDST THOU PICK UP SUCH A BEAUTY
I TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL ALL FOUR GIVE A BANQUET AND INVITE THE FOX AND THE CAT AND DO FOR THE PAIR OF THEM
IT WAS AILBE'S WOLF-MOTHER
BUT THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO PUT THE FIRE OUT
WHO WILL GIVE ME A PIECE OF BREAD
INSTEAD SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE HIM
KIT'S WERE STILL BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER NEAR THE PIER
THE WIVES OF THE ELDER BROTHERS WATCHED THESE DEVICES AND TOOK CARE TO DO THE SAME
DEAR SISTER I MUST GO OUT TO FIND WORK BEFORE THE FOOD COMES TO AN END SO SHE KISSED HER MOTHER AND WRAPPING HERSELF UP STARTED FROM HOME
OH AUNT HE CALLED EVEN BEFORE HE REACHED HER LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL DOG
FOR NINE DAYS THERE WAS FEASTING AND BELLEROPHON WON EVERYONE'S HEART BY HIS WIT AND GRACE
IN AN INSTANT THE GOOD DOG SPRANG TO THE CHILD'S SIDE BARKING FURIOUSLY FOR EVERY DOG IN SWITZERLAND KNOWS THAT THOSE WHO SLEEP ON SNOW PILLOWS SELDOM WAKE UP
I WOULD HAVE HIM FOR MY MASTER FOR HE IS THE MIGHTIEST KING ON EARTH I AM HE ANSWERED SATAN
THE FEAST OF LANTERNS AND THE POT OF GOLD EMPHASIZE THE TRUTH THAT EAST OR WEST HAME'S BEST
HOW BEAUTIFULLY THEY FIT
SHE IS NOW WITH KOSHCHEI
BUT HE DID THEM ALL EASILY WITH THE HELP OF HIS WINGED HORSE
SHE AND HANS HAD ON THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND ALL THE VILLAGE WAS PREPARED FOR A HOLIDAY
COME EVERY DAY WITH MY BROTHERS TO MY TABLE AND YOU AND YOURS SHALL SHARE MY FOOD AS ONCE I SO OFTEN SHARED YOURS AND SO IT WAS
HARRAP AND COMPANY AND THE TSAR SPOKE THESE WORDS TO THEM
HIS MOTHER CAME OUT AND SAT DOWN BY HIS SIDE
TSAREVICH IVAN
LET'S SWAP CAPS HE SAID AND I WILL GIVE YOU MY JACK-KNIFE TO BOOT NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED
C PREFACE THERE IS NO NEED HERE TO ENTER A PLEA FOR STORY-TELLING
IT WAS ONLY THE SKY-DRAGON PUTTING OUT THE FIRE WANG CHIH HAD KINDLED
HOW SWIFTLY THEY FLEW UNDER THE BRIGHT STARS
THE PILLAR AND THE POT OF GOLD FADED AWAY
LINCOLN HESITATED
ASSEMBLE SET TO WORK AND MAKE ME SOFT WHITE BREAD SUCH AS I MYSELF USED TO EAT AT MY DEAR FATHER'S IN THE MORNING IVAN AWOKE
A HUNTER AND HIS LITTLE SON TOOK CARE OF THIS FIRE AND KEPT IT BURNING DAY AND NIGHT
THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE BAD ROADS AND OF THE SNOW WHICH SOMETIMES SLIDES IN GREAT MASSES BURYING EVERYTHING IN ITS WAY
REMEMBER IT IS THE FEAST OF LANTERNS TO-NIGHT FATHER SHE SAID
AND IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY SINCE OH-I-AM KNEW THE JOKE ALREADY EVERY BIT
HE REINED IN HIS HORSE AND BLEW A HORN
FOURTH IMPRESSION ENLARGED
PRINCE HARWEDA FELT QUITE SURE THAT THE CRACKS OF LIGHT WERE WIDER AND ON GOING UP TO ONE AND PUTTING HIS EYE CLOSE TO IT AS HE WOULD TO A PINHOLE IN A PAPER HE WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT HE COULD TELL THE GREENNESS OF THE GRASS FROM THE BLUE OF THE SKY
IT WAS SO HARD AND SHARP THAT WHEN IT STRUCK A ROCK IT WENT INTO IT A FOOT OR MORE
INDEED YOU ARE NOT SAID THE OTHER SOLDIER AND PUT HIS FOOT FORWARD
BUT HE WAS NOT QUITE ABLE THE HUNTER THOUGHT
ONCE THE BLACK COW STEPPED ON A LONG DRY BRANCH
AMONG ALL THE OTHER NOISES OF THE CHASE HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH MADE HIM THINK--THINK--THINK
HE DID NOT SEEM STRONG
HE WHISTLED MORE LOUDLY THAN EVER AND WALKED BRAVELY ON
NO CRIED THE PRINCE SHE SHALL NEVER HAVE IT ALL THIS TIME TEENCHY DUCK WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT SINGING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE
THE HOP-ABOUT MAN'S PLATTER WHICH WEE-WUN HAD FORGOTTEN TO WASH FLEW UP TO THE CEILING AND THE WOODEN SPOON SPUN ROUND LIKE A TOP ON THE FLOOR AND ALL THE CHAIRS AND TABLES WEE-WUN HAD LEFT AWRY BEGAN TO DANCE
HE CARED NOTHING NOW FOR THE STUPID MIRRORS WHICH COULD ONLY REFLECT WHAT WAS PLACED BEFORE THEM
I SHALL HAVE TO GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN FOR IT AT NOON HE SAID
HIS FATHER HEARD HIM OPEN THE GREAT GATE AND CAME OUT WITH A LIGHT
BUT LI'L HANNIBAL WAS MOST INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT BR'ER RABBIT WAS DOING
THE DONKEY WAS TO STAND ON HIS HIND LEGS AND PLACE HIS FOREFEET ON THE WINDOW-SILL
HERE IT IS SHE SAID AND THREW IT DOWN
WHO WAS THE MIGHTIER?_[22 FANNY E
HE TUGGED AND HE TUGGED BUT IT WAS NO GOOD AND THE OX DRAGGED HIM GRADUALLY OFF GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE
CERTAINLY MY FINE HOUSE WILL COME DOWN ABOUT MY EARS CRIED POOR WEE-WUN
HE WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS NOT FAR FROM HOME
THIS MORNING GRANDFATHER CARRIED HIS ROD AND THE LUNCH-BASKET
NOW I MUST TELL AT ONCE HOW ROBBY LOOKED ELSE HOW WILL YOU KNOW HIM IF YOU MEET HIM IN THE STREET
THEN THE FOX CAME UP AND SAID
THE CAPTAIN WALKED FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE LONELY VALLEY AND AT LAST KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF A SMALL COTTAGE
BRER RABBIT WENT ON HOME EN SHO NUFF HE FIN BRER WOLF EN BRER FOX WAITIN FER IM

SIRE HE SAID DO YOU THINK THAT I HAVE WON THE PRIZE MOST CERTAINLY I DO ANSWERED THE KING
THEN IN THE OTHER HE HELD UP HIS CROOK WARNINGLY TO KEEP BACK THE FEROCIOUS DOGS
IS THAT ALL ASKED KIT
I BELONG IT SAID TO ONE-EYE THE POTATO-WIFE
DUST UNDER THE RUG THERE IS THE LITTLE GIRL CRIED THE STARS WHO KEEPS HOME AS BRIGHT AS STAR-SHINE DUST UNDER THE RUG
NEXT MORNING BEFORE DAY THE SERVANTS WENT TO GET THE ANIMALS TO PUT THEM TO THE PLOUGHS AND WAGGONS
AND THERE WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN ABOUT HER IN A HAPPY CIRCLE THE KIND WOLF-MOTHER SAT AND ATE THE GOOD THINGS WHICH THE BISHOP'S FRIENDS HAD SENT HIM
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AS OEYVIND AND HIS MOTHER ENTERED AND AS HE WAS GOING TO FIND A SEAT THEY ALL WANTED TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM
THEN HE BEGAN TO GROW OH
HE FELT ITS EDGE
IF YOU SAY THESE WORDS
THE NEIGHBOURING FARMERS GUARDED THEIR HEN-ROOSTS SO CAREFULLY FROM HIS DEPREDATIONS THAT A NICE FAT HEN WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND THE WEATHER WAS TOO COLD TO TEMPT THE RABBITS OUT OF THEIR SNUG WARREN
I KIN BITE LOTS BETTER'N I KIN TALK
HE WAS READING A BOOK
WHY IS HE COMING AND WHAT WILL HE SEE
THESE BOOKS MAY HELP ME READ THE WRITING THOUGHT CHRIF
WHEN CORALIE CAME TOWARD THE CASTLE MERLIN WAS FORCED TO BURN VINEGAR TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM BEING ILL
WE INVITE YOUR LITTLE LADYSHIP FOXEY-WOXEY TOGETHER WITH MR SHAGGY MATTHEW TO DINNER AND BACK HE RAN AGAIN
THE CRANE WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE SAID THE OLD MEN
AND THE TASSEL WAS BLUE
HE PUT A QUEER STICK INTO A BAG AND GAVE IT TO THE BOY AND TOLD HIM TO GO BACK AND LOCK HIS DOOR AS TIGHTLY AS BEFORE
I HAVE NO FOOD FOR YOU SHE SAID TO THE OLD MAN
IT HAD ALMOST EVERYTHING IN IT THAT ANYONE COULD WANT
WHERE DID YOU GET IT THEY ASKED
AND WITH THEIR TAILS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS AND THEIR HEADS DROOPING LOW THEY SLUNK BACK TO THEIR LONELY DEN WHERE THEY WOULD NEVER SEE THEIR LITTLE BOY PLAYMATE ANY MORE
THEN HE WENT ON DIGGING AND HE DUG AND DUG AND DUG
HIS LONG LEGS SOON OVERTOOK IT IN A CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE IT WAS HIDING AND IMAGINE THE HUNTER'S SURPRISE WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT HAD NEITHER FUR NOR HORNS NOR FOUR FEET NOR A TAIL BUT THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CHILD WHO COULD NOT STAND UPRIGHT AND WHOSE LITTLE BARE BODY RAN ON ALL-FOURS LIKE A BABY WOLF
THE FIRST THING WAS OF COURSE TO BRING THE DRAGON OUT AND THE NEXT TO MAKE HIM BREATHE WATER INSTEAD OF FIRE
HE GOT A MIGHTY QUICK EYE MON EN HE TUCK NOTICE DAT EV'YTHING MIGHTY STILL
AND THE TSAR CALLED THEM TO HIM AND SAID
THE OLD BROOM-WOMAN STOOD IN THE ROAD
THINGS WILL BE QUIET AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE PUT ALL CARELESS THINGS STRAIGHT SO WEE-WUN SET TO WORK AND HE WEPT EVER SO FAST
BUT THE CHILD SHE LOVED BEST WAS NONE OF THOSE IN FURRY COATS AND FINE WHISKERS THAT LOOKED LIKE HER
HANS'S UNCLE AND AUNT HEARD IT AS THEY SEARCHED THROUGH THE HOUSE FOR THEIR LITTLE BOY
HE GREW HOT ALL OVER LOOKED ROUND ABOUT AND CALLED KILLY-KILLY-KILLY-GOAT BAY-AY-AY SAID THE GOAT FROM THE BROW OF THE HILL AS HE COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN
OH WHAT A HEAD I'VE GOT!--IF I DIDN'T QUITE FORGET CRIED THE HARE AND BACK HE WENT AGAIN RAN BENEATH THE WINDOW AND CRIED
AND SO IT WENT ON UNTIL IT HAD GONE ROUND AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE IT HAD BEGUN
YES YES EXCLAIMED TEENCHY DUCK
THEN THE CHILDREN SANG AND OEYVIND STOOD WITH MARIT BY THE DOOR
JOHN
JOHN
THEY HAD GIVEN UP THE HOPELESS CHASE
HARRAP COMPANY WHY YOU FOOLISH WOMAN SAID HE WHAT'S THE GOOD OF AN OX OF THAT SORT NEVER MIND SAID SHE YOU JUST MAKE IT
TEENCHY WENT ON HER WAY AGAIN
KAT BROUGHT SHELLS AND PEBBLES TO KIT BECAUSE HE HAD TO STAY COVERED UP IN THE SAND AND KIT BUILT A PLAY DYKE ALL AROUND HIMSELF WITH THEM AND KAT DUG A CANAL OUTSIDE THE DYKE
YOU ARE ALWAYS WONDERING IT IS NOTHING BUT A WOODPECKER TAPPING ON A HOLLOW TREE SAID PETER
ON ONE CORNER OF THE SLAB LAY A HEAP OF SMALL BROWN OBJECTS WHICH WANG CHIH TOOK AT FIRST TO BE DATE STONES
THE BOAT-GARDEN WAS HIDDEN UNDER THE SNOW
I SHOULD KEEP THEM BOTH
ONE NIGHT WHEN THE LITTLE OLD MAN AND THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WERE FAST ASLEEP CREEP CREEP THROUGH THE WOODS CAME THE HOBYAHS SKIPPING ALONG ON THE TIPS OF THEIR TOES
DEAR LITTLE FELLOW CRIED HARWEDA DO YOU ALSO LONG FOR YOUR FREEDOM
IS IT YOU WHO HAVE COME WITH IT SHE SAT TEARING THE GRASS UP WITH HER HANDS AND SAID
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SAVE A SINGLE PENNY
THE WOLF-MOTHER OF SAINT AILBE ABBIE FARWELL BROWN AILBE'S BABYHOOD THIS IS THE STORY OF A POOR LITTLE IRISH BABY WHOSE CRUEL FATHER AND MOTHER DID NOT CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
SOME OF THEM CAME IN CARRIAGES SOME ON FOOT
WHEN THERE MET HIM AN OLD OLD MAN
FOR HE IS WISE ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF ANYWHERE WISER THAN YOU LAUGHED THE REST
WEE-WUN MIGHT HAVE LIVED ON THE OTHER COMMON WITH THE OTHER GNOMES AND FAIRIES IF HE HAD LIKED
YOU ARE A CHEAT NORTH WIND
ESPECIALLY HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE HIS DEAR FOSTER MOTHER
SO WHEN POCAHONTAS LEARNED THAT HER DEAR FRIEND MUST DIE SHE FELT VERY SAD AND TRIED TO THINK OF SOME WAY OF SAVING HIS LIFE
IT IS BUT TWO DAYS MORE
CATCH IT LIKE TO DEAFEN EVERYBODY
CABOT AND E
LITTLE HARES HAVE NICE LITTLE SOFT WARM SKINS WHICH WILL MAKE ME NICE GLOVES AND MITTENS AGAINST THE WINTER OH
ON THE GROUND NOT FAR FROM THE ROADSIDE TWO LITTLE BIRDS LAY IN THE GRASS
BUT I MUST NOT TELL YOU NOW BECAUSE IF I DO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT THEIR GOING FISHING
GOOD YOUTH WHY DOST THOU VISIT ME ASKED THE BABA-YAGA
BEHIND THEM CAME WADDLING A DUCK
NOT A RAY OF LIGHT CAME FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND OF COURSE NOT AN OBJECT IN THE ROOM COULD BE SEEN
YOU SEE I AM GOING TO TRY MY LUCK AS A STREET MUSICIAN IN THE CITY
HOW COULD THE DEAR DOG FIND HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARKNESS ALONE
SO THE CAT AND THE FOX WENT TO THE BANQUET AND WHEN THE CAT SAW THE BACON HE PUT UP HIS BACK AND STUCK OUT HIS TAIL AND CRIED
DEN ATTER SO LONG A TIME ATTER BRER RABBIT GOT DONE LAUGHIN HE CALL UP DE LITTLE RABS GI UM SOME LASSES FER SUPPER EN SPANKED UM EN SONT UM TER BED WELL WHAT DID HE SPANK EM FOR UNCLE REMUS ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
ALL THE PEOPLE WORE THEIR FINEST CLOTHES
COME OUT AND HELP ME A BUZZING SOUND WAS HEARD AND THEN THE BEES SWARMED ON THE PRINCE AND HIS WIFE AND STUNG THEM SO BADLY THAT THEY BECAME FRIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD
I CAN REACH THEIR HOME EASILY
AND AFTER THE DWARFS LEFT SHE CLEANED UP THE ROOMS AND MENDED THE DWARFS CLOTHES
COME LAY THEE DOWN AND SLEEP
OF COURSE YOU DO GROWLED PAUL
WILL YOU KINDLY SHOW ME A FIELD WHERE MY SOLDIERS CAN CUT THE GRAIN AND CARRY IT OFF FOR OUR ARMY THE OLD MAN LED THE SOLDIERS THROUGH THE VALLEY FOR ABOUT A MILE AND IN THE DISTANCE THEY SAW A FIELD OF BARLEY WAVING IN THE BREEZE
HE KICKED IT AND BEAT UPON IT BUT HE ONLY BRUISED HIS FISTS AND HURT HIS TOES
AND HE WEPT AND WEPT
SO SHE SAT STILL IN HER CHAIR AND SEWED WHILE MINNIE THE SISTER WASHED THE DISHES SWEPT THE FLOOR AND MADE THE HOME BEAUTIFUL
BRING A PLATE MOTHER FOR SEE SHE OPENED HER HANDS AND SHOWERED DOWN RICH FRUIT AND DELICIOUS CAKES WHICH SHE HAD SAVED FOR HER MOTHER
GOOD OLD NORTH WIND SAID THE BOY
THEN HE PULLED THE MATTRESS FROM THE BED AND CUT A GREAT HOLE IN IT AND WHEN HE HAD SEARCHED AND SEARCHED HE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MATTRESS--A BIG BROWN POTATO
SO THEY ARE KIT AND KAT WHILE THEY ARE ON THE WAY TO FOUR AND A HALF FEET
THE FOUR COMRADES RUSHING IN HURRIED TO THE TABLE AND ATE AS IF THEY HAD HAD NOTHING FOR A MONTH
I HAVE TAKEN SUCH A FANCY TO THE GOAT
HE SAW HER GREY EYES HER GOLDEN HAIR AND HER GLISTENING ARMOUR
THE POOR FARMER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD BUT A LITTLE HUT THAT SEEMED READY TO TUMBLE DOWN EVERY TIME THE WIND BLEW
IT GREW LARGER AND BRIGHTER AS THEY CAME NEARER TO IT TILL THEY SAW THAT IT CAME FROM THE WINDOW OF A SMALL HUT
BUT HARDLY HAD HE TIME TO THINK AGAIN AND REMEMBER BEFORE DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET CAME A GAUNT FIGURE FLYING IN LONG LEAPS FROM THE FOREMOST DOGS WHO WERE SNAPPING AT HER HEELS
I SHOULD RUN IF I HEARD A BEAR COMING NATHAN STOPPED A MOMENT TO LISTEN
ARE YOU NOT TIRED DIGGING HERE ALL BY YOURSELF AH MY MASTER ANSWERED THE PICKAXE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU A LONG TIME WELL HERE I AM SAID JACK
I'LL CARRY YOU AS BEST I CAN THEN THE RIVER GOT INTO THE SATCHEL BY THE SIDE OF THE OTHER FRIENDS OF TEENCHY DUCK
AND LOOK OH LOOK
HE WAS GREATLY TROUBLED
I CAUGHT YOU THEN KAT THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE MOLLY SHOOK HER HEAD
BABY COME TO ME WASIS DROPPED HIS MAPLE SUGAR
THE END OF THE WOOD PATH WAS NEAR THE DOOR OF THE BARN
SO A POPGUN WAS ADDED TO THE MEDLEY OF TOYS
FOOTNOTE 5
AND EARLY NEXT MORNING SHE HASTENED HOME WITH HER GOLDEN TREASURE WHICH BOUGHT MANY THINGS FOR THE DEAR MOTHER AND LITTLE SISTER
BUT I HAVE SO MANY DOLLS THAT I DON'T REALLY NEED ANY MORE OH MOLLY SEE THIS AND JULIA PAUSED BEFORE A TALL ROUND BASKET
AND I AM GLAD OF IT YOU HAVE SAVED OUR EARS SAID PETER AND WE ARE ALL LUCKY THE FEAST OF LANTERNS_[10 WANG CHIH WATCHES A GAME OF CHESS WANG CHIH WAS ONLY A POOR MAN BUT HE HAD A WIFE AND CHILDREN TO LOVE AND THEY MADE HIM SO HAPPY THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED PLACES WITH THE EMPEROR HIMSELF
THEN HE HEARD A LITTLE VOICE FROM HIS WINDOW CRYING HERE I AM WRY-FACE HERE I AM BUT HE COULD NOT GO OUT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS YET AWHILE
WHAT A LITTLE
FRIEND BEES
HE SAT AS BEFORE AND HELD ON TO HIS RED CAP WHICH EVERYBODY WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET
IN FACT HE SCARCELY GLANCED OUT OF THE WINDOWS AT ALL HE WAS SO TAKEN UP WITH THE BROAD HANDSOME MIRRORS
IF ANYONE SHALL TRY TO DIG THE WELL AND SHALL NOT SUCCEED HE SHALL HAVE HIS NOSE CUT OFF
LINCOLN WAS MOST CAREFUL OF HIS WELL-WORN SUIT
AND HE NODDED HIS HEAD SO MANY TIMES THAT THE WHITE CRANE EXPECTED TO SEE IT FALL OFF
THE GAME TOOK ALL HIS THOUGHT FOR HE WAS MOST UNLUCKY
DEAR CHILD THE GOLD IS ALL FOR YOU FOR FAITHFUL YOU HAVE PROVED AND TRUE
WHERE DO THE SHIPS GO GRANDFATHER ASKED KIT
NATHAN LIKED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM
THAT MORNING AS MINNIE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO WATCH THE DWARFS GO TO THEIR WORK SHE SAW ON ONE OF THE WINDOW-PANES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE SHE HAD EVER SEEN
BUT NO SOONER DID HE LIE DOWN AGAIN THAN THERE WAS ANOTHER DURRRRR AT THE DOOR
MY FATHER AND SOVEREIGN LORD HAS COMMANDED ME TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM WITH THEE TO-MORROW

AT LAST HE FOUND AN OLD HERMIT AND ASKED HIM THE QUESTION HE HAD ASKED SO MANY OTHERS
HE GATHERED UP EVERY BIT WITH THE UTMOST CARE
THIS FRIGHTENED THE ROBBER SO TERRIBLY THAT HE RUSHED TO THE DOOR BUT THE DOG WHO LAY THERE SPRANG OUT AT HIM AND BIT HIM ON THE LEG AS HE WENT BY
THEN HE PUSHED OPEN THE GARDEN GATE AND WALKED UP THE PATH TO THE DOOR
THEY LET THEIR FRIENDS CUT THEM WITH KNIVES AND NEVER EVEN CRY OUT

THE HARE OF THE MOON LIVES A THOUSAND YEARS AS YOU KNOW AND WHEN HE IS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD HE CHANGES HIS COLOUR FROM BROWN TO WHITE AND BECOMES IF POSSIBLE BETTER TEMPERED AND NICER THAN HE WAS BEFORE
I CANNOT CATCH MICE ANY LONGER AND I LIKE TO LIE BEHIND THE STOVE AND PURR
AND AS THEY MARCHED THEY SANG THIS SONG
IF YOU DRINK THAT YOU WILL LIVE FOR EVER SAID ONE OF THEM
IT WAS THAT KIND OF CLOCK CALLED A CUCKOO CLOCK
SOON HE REJOINED HIS FRIENDS
HE CAN TALK TO HIS FRIENDS BY MAKING MARKS ON PAPER AND HE CAN MAKE A FIRE WITHOUT A FLINT BRING HIM HERE SAID THE CHIEF AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH WAS BROUGHT BEFORE POWHATAN
HIS COAT AND CAP ARE TRIMMED WITH WREATHS OF HOLLY BRIGHT WITH SCARLET BERRIES
THEY CALLED IT A DYKE
FOLK TALES MODERN FAIRY TALES AND MYTHS HAVE A GENEROUS SHOWING
HE BOWED TO THE KING AND SAID PLEASE LET ME TRY
IT WAS PRINCE
THE OLD MAN WAS BENT OVER THE BOOKS
THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HER OLD MAN AND HE TOOK AND CAST THE FOX INTO THE CELLAR IN THE SAME WAY
HE HAD WAKED UP FROM HIS NAP BEHIND THE STOVE AND HASTENED AFTER THE SOLDIER COUSIN AS FAST AS HIS FOUR FEET COULD CARRY HIM
THIS ORDER WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED OUT BY THE SERVANT BUT NO SOONER HAD TEENCHY DUCK ENTERED THE HENHOUSE THAN SHE EXCLAIMED
NO INDEED
SOME WERE RICH SOME WERE POOR
HE LOOKED AROUND A LONG TIME WITH HIS CAP IN HIS HAND AND JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO SIT DOWN HE SAW CLOSE BESIDE HIM SITTING BY THE HEARTH-STONE MARIT OF THE MANY NAMES
THAT IS BECAUSE THE STIR-ABOUT WIFE LIKES BEST TO BREW GOLDEN SPELLS THAT WILL MAKE FOLK HAPPY AND OF COURSE DANDELIONS ARE THE FLOWERS YOU USE FOR GOLDEN SPELLS
SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE ROAD WHICH RAN BY THE HOUSE ACROSS THE CANAL ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE LEVEL GREEN FIELDS THAT LAY BEYOND CLEAR TO THE BLUE RIM OF THE WORLD WHERE THE SKY TOUCHES THE EARTH
IT WILL NEVER DO TO GO HOME WITHOUT ANY FISH AT ALL SO BY-AND-BY HE WENT BACK TO THE PIER AND CAUGHT ONE WHILE THE TWINS PLAYED IN THE SAND
SO WILL I SAID KAT
CHRIF ATE LITTLE AND SLEPT LESS
C
C
C
HIS MOTHER SANG
HIS MOTHER SANG
SHE WAS SADLY DISAPPOINTED AND FELT VERY MUCH LIKE CRYING
HE REPEATED THE PROMISE WHICH HE HAD MADE TO THE WOLF AND WARNED EVERYONE HENCEFORTH NOT TO HURT HER OR HER CHILDREN EITHER IN THE VILLAGE OR IN THE WOODS OR ON THE MOUNTAIN
I CAN BARKED PRINCE
AND LO
AND LO
HANS WAS NEVER LONELY AFTER PRINCE CAME
RHODA STOOD BESIDE HIM
I ONLY HAVE SIXPENCE SHE ANSWERED WITH A SIGH
THE SMALL PARTY HAD SOME DISTANCE TO GO
WHEN THE BEAR SAW THE BRIGHT LIGHT HE TURNED SLOWLY
THE IMPOSTORS NOW DEMANDED MORE MONEY AND MORE SILK AND GOLD TO USE IN THEIR WEAVING
NOT LONG AFTER THEY SAW A CAT SITTING IN THE ROAD WITH A FACE AS DISMAL AS THREE DAYS OF RAINY WEATHER
SOME TIME I WILL TELL YOU HOW HE DID IT
RHODA HE CRIED AND FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS
VERY WELL THEN I WILL WAIT TILL THE MORNING
THE GREAT TEARS RAN DOWN HANS'S CHEEKS AND ON TO THE DOG'S BACK BUT HIS AUNT DID NOT NOTICE THEM
WHEN NIGHT CAME THE HOBYAHS WOKE UP AND THEY WENT TO THE BAG AND THEY POKED IT WITH THEIR FINGERS CRYING
THEN HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR SOMEONE TO COME AND OPEN A WINDOW FOR HIM BUT NO ONE CAME
GIVE ME BACK MY BEAUTIFUL MONEY TEENCHY DUCK'S FRIENDS GO WITH HER ON HER QUEST BROTHER FOX WHO WAS TAKING HIS EASE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE ROAD HEARD TEENCHY DUCK'S CRIES AND KNEW HER VOICE
I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE WAS ASTONISHED FOR BY THE PALINGS STOOD THE OX WITH THE WOLF STILL TUGGING AT IT
CHRIF WAS ALL ALONE
BUT THEY SAID LIKE THE EMPEROR OH
THE BELLS RANG LOUD AND CLEAR AS IF THEY HAD GREAT NEWS TO TELL THE WORLD
AND SHE LOOKED AT CHRIF AND SMILED
CHRISTOPHER WAS NO RELATION TO RHODA AND HER GRANDMOTHER
AT NOONTIDE WHEN HIS FELLOW-LABOURERS GAVE UP WORKING AND SAT DOWN TO REST AND EAT WANG CHIH TOOK HIS AXE AND WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPE TO FIND A SMALL TREE THAT HE MIGHT CUT DOWN FOR FUEL
PRITCHARD
BUT SHE HELD UP HER HANDS IN AMAZEMENT AT THE THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
WHEN GRANDFATHER CAME HE BROUGHT A LARGE FISHING-ROD FOR HIMSELF AND TWO LITTLE ONES FOR THE TWINS
YOU OFTEN GIVE NIGHT CONCERTS I KNOW SO YOU CAN EASILY BECOME A STREET MUSICIAN WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE CAT SO SHE WALKED ON WITH THEM
HE ROARED HIS ORDERS TO WASIS AGAIN AND AGAIN
NOW I CAN HAVE ALL THE SWEET ODOURS I WANT WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF GOING INTO THE GARDEN FOR ROSES OR LILIES IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM WAS A FOUNTAIN OF SPARKLING WATER WHICH LEAPED UP AND FELL BACK INTO ITS MARBLE BASIN WITH A FAINT DREAMY MUSIC VERY PLEASANT TO HEAR
THERE WAS THE DEAR OLD BOAT-GARDEN
ONE DAY HE WAS KEEPING HIS SHEEP NEAR A GREAT WOOD WHEN A HUNTER RODE UP TO HIM
COME OUT AND KILL IT THEN THE OLD MAN JUMPED UP TORE OFF THE BEAR TIED HIM UP AND THREW HIM IN THE CELLAR
UPON A HIGH PILLAR NEAR THE COAST IS THE FAMOUS POT OF GOLD OH WHERE IS THIS COUNTRY CRIED CHRIF
MANY YEARS WENT BY
AS FOR THE KNIFE IT WOULD NOT MOVE EITHER NOT AN INCH
WHAT A LITTLE WHAT SAID THE BEAR WHO WAS HIDING BEHIND THE BEECHES WITH THE OTHER BEASTS HERE HAVE WE FOUR BEEN GETTING TOGETHER ALL WE COULD AND THIS PIG-FACED CAT CALLS IT TOO LITTLE
SHE THREW HERSELF OVER THE GOAT AND WEPT
THE EASTERN WINDOWS GAVE EACH MORNING A GLORIOUS VIEW OF THE SUNRISE
KIT DUG THE WORMS AND KAT PUT THEM INTO A BASKET WITH SOME EARTH IN IT TO MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME
AILBE NEVER KNEW WHO HIS FIRST MOTHER WAS BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A BAD CRUEL WOMAN
OF COURSE IT WAS SAID PETER
GRANDFATHER MUST HAVE TOLD VROUW VEDDER SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE HE WAS SO AWKWARD SAID PAUL
THE HARE WAS BUSY POUNDING THE DRUGS WHICH MAKE UP THE ELIXIR OF LIFE
SO STRAIGHTWAY HE BUILT A HUT BY THE SWIFT STREAM AND CUT A STOUT STAFF TO STEADY HIS STEPS WHEN THE RIVER ROARED HIGH
BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE SPELL WHICH OH-I-AM HAD PLACED BY HIS DOOR
I AIN'T NO POT-RACK I AIN'T NO RAFTER EN I AIN'T NO BED-CORD BUT PLEASE GRACIOUS
WHERE DO YOU GO
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER KEEP THE GOAT SAID OEYVIND LOOKING THE OTHER WAY
THAT LEAVES ONLY THREE PRESENTS FOR TOMMY
HE SPED ACROSS THE PLAIN AND ENTERED THE WOOD
HE TORE AND TORE AND BURIED HIS TEETH IN IT TILL HE FOUND HE COULDN'T LET GO AGAIN
HANS STILL CARRIED THE DOG IN HIS ARMS AND ALL THE NEIGHBOURS THEY MET STOPPED TO ASK IF SILLY HANS HAD REALLY GIVEN HIS SILVER CHAIN FOR A DOG AS THEY HAD HEARD
BUT IVAN SAID
BEFORE THEY COULD ASK HIM TO LIGHT THE KITCHEN FIRE OR FILL THE TEA-KETTLE OR MIX THE HOECAKE OR DUST THE HEARTH OR FEED THE TURKEYS OR CHOP ANY WOOD OR GO TO THE STORE OR PICK ANY COTTON HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR HIS GRAN'MAMMY AND HIS GRAN'DADDY ANY LONGER
NO ONE CAN TELL TO-DAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE WONDERFUL NECKLACE OF TRUTH
THEN HE SAW WRY-FACE THE GNOME HIDING AMONG THE BRACKEN AND LOOKING AS MISCHIEVOUS AS ANYTHING
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING IT WAS QUITE DARK AND THEY ALL WENT HOME EVEN BR'ER POSSUM AND THEY LEFT LI'L HANNIBAL SITTING THERE ALL BY HIMSELF
HE CANNOT GET DOWN
DON'T FALL ASLEEP UP ON THE MOUNTAIN

AND THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT IT TOOK HIS HUNGER AND THIRST AWAY
THE PRINCE HIMSELF GAVE THE CHILD THE MONEY THAT BOUGHT IT SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT FOR WANG CHIH STILL LINGERED AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
ALL THE LORDS FOR MILES AROUND WERE OUT CHASING THE WILD BEASTS AND AMONG THEM WAS THE PRINCE AILBE'S FOSTER FATHER
HE PUT INTO IT A POTATO AND A GRAIN OF EARTH AND A DOWN FROM A PILLOW AND A PEARL AND AN APPLE-PIP FROM A PIE
HIS HEART BEAT FAST
A PICTURE OF FAIRY PALACES WITH TOWERS OF SILVER AND FROSTED PINNACLES SO WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL THAT AS SHE LOOKED AT IT SHE FORGOT THAT THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE UNTIL THE CUCKOO CLOCK ON THE MANTEL STRUCK TWELVE
GRANDFATHER IS SITTING UP THERE WAITING WHILE THE BOY STOOD LOOKING AT HER HE HEARD A SHARP VOICE FROM THE ROAD ABOVE CALL OUT NOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED WHAT SHE WAS TO DO
THE HUT WAS STANDING ON HEN'S LEGS AND TURNING ROUND AND ROUND
THESE HEADS WERE THOSE OF A LION A GOAT AND A DRAGON
THEN THE NOBLE HORSE BENT HIS HEAD AND WALKED UP TO THE YOUNG MAN
WE WILL HAVE TWO DIPS SHE SAID
GRANDFATHER REACHED DOWN AND PULLED HIM UP
THEN THEY TURNED TO THE LEFT AND WALKED ALONG A PATH THAT RAN FROM THE CANAL ACROSS THE GREEN FIELDS TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A HILL
HANS'S UNCLE KNEW MANY STORIES OF TRAVELLERS WHO HAD BEEN LOST IN THE SNOW AND HE TOLD TOO OF SOME GOOD MEN LIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS WHO SENT THEIR DOGS OUT TO FIND AND HELP PEOPLE WHO WERE LOST--"DOGS LIKE OUR PRINCE HERE HE WOULD SAY

THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND UTTERED SHRIEKS SO EAR-PIERCING THAT THEIR LIKE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD BEFORE
THEN HE WENT BACK THROUGH THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE ROAD INTO THE WOOD PATH
I HAVE BEEN ROUND THE WORLD BUT NEVER HAVE I MET A SOUL SO SMALL
AND HE BADE HIS SERVANTS BRING THE THREE BAGS OF GOLD AND POUR THE COINS OUT AT JACK'S FEET
THE TSAR GREATLY PRAISED IVAN FOR HIS CARPET AND THERE AND THEN GAVE THE NEW COMMAND THAT ALL THREE TSAREVICHES WERE TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM ON THE MORROW TO BE INSPECTED TOGETHER WITH THEIR WIVES
GOOD GRACIOUS ME CRIED WRY-FACE IN A RAGE I NEVER PLANTED A POTATO-PLANT THERE NOT IN MY WHOLE LIFE

THE STREET MUSICIANS LIDA MCMURRY A DONKEY WHO HAD CARRIED SACKS TO THE MILL FOR HIS MASTER A GREAT MANY YEARS BECAME SO WEAK THAT HE COULD NOT WORK FOR A LIVING ANY LONGER
HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND SET THE GRASS ON FIRE AND IT WAS SO DRY THAT THE FLAMES SPREAD ALL AROUND THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE AND MADE SUCH A SMOKE AND CRACKLING THAT THE SKY-DRAGON PUT HIS HEAD OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
AS HE DREW NEAR THE WIGWAM HE CALLED HERE IS FOOD MY SON THERE WAS NO REPLY
SOMETIMES THEY OFFERED HIM MONEY BUT HE ALWAYS SHOOK HIS GREAT HEAD
OEYVIND AND MARIT ALSO FOLDED THEIR HANDS BUT THEY COULD NOT SING
IT IS RATHER FROM SUCH APPEAL TO THE EMOTIONS AS CAN BE MADE MOST EFFECTUALLY THROUGH THE TELLING OF A STORY
WE REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE OUR EYES THEN THEY SPIED MINNIE AND CRIED IN GREAT ASTONISHMENT
THEIR ADVENTURES BY THE WAY PETER AND PAUL WENT JOGGING ALONG WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS

FILIAL DEVOTION SHINES FROM THE STORIES OF ANDERS NEW CAP HOW THE SUN THE MOON AND THE WIND WENT OUT TO DINNER AND THE WOLF-MOTHER OF SAINT-AILBE THE FORM OF EACH STORY IS SUCH THAT THE PARENT OR TEACHER CAN TELL OR READ THE STORY AS IT APPEARS IN THE BOOK WITH ONLY SUCH SLIGHT MODIFICATION AS HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD OR CLASS WOULD NATURALLY PROMPT HIM TO MAKE

RHODA WATCHED HIM OUT OF SIGHT
AH HOW BEAUTIFUL THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD LOOK TO ME NOW THE NEXT DAY HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BEGAN TO BITE ONE OF THE OLD WITHERED APPLES AND AS HE BIT IT HE THOUGHT OF THE BIRD HIS FELLOW-PRISONER

NOW I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING BY MY WINDOW THE POTATO-PLANT TOOK NO NOTICE BUT WENT ON CLIMBING HIGH HIGH AND HIGHER
SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE HANDSOMEST DANCER
AND YOU WILL DIE AT LAST OF STARVATION WITHOUT A DOUBT SO WRY-FACE STORED THE POTATO IN THE POTATO-BIN AND HE WENT SUPPERLESS TO BED
THE BOY WENT OUT AND FOUND HIS SHEEP IN THE BARN AND DROVE IT AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD BUT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE INNKEEPER AND MAYBE THAT STICK IS POUNDING HIM TO THIS DAY
IF THERE WERE NO WALLS TO SHUT OUT THE SEA THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE COVERED WITH WATER
AS I HAVE SPENT YOUR SIXPENCE I WANT YOU TO SPEND MINE AND THEN WE SHALL BE EVEN
HE DID NOT LIKE TO WORRY HER THOUGH SO HE SAT DOWN ON A DOORSTEP TO REST WHILE SHE TALKED TO HER FRIENDS IN THE CROWD
MAY I GO HOME TO BID MY FATHER AND MOTHER GOOD-BYE AND TO ARRANGE MY AFFAIRS BEFORE I DIE ASKED PYTHIAS
AND THAT IS WHY THERE ARE NOT ANY HOBYAHS NOW
SHE COOKED A THIRD CAKE THAT WAS NO LARGER THAN A THIMBLE
HE PUT THE BASKET DOWN ON THE STEP AND HANS HEARD A QUEER LITTLE GRUMBLING SOUND INSIDE
THEN WEE-WUN WENT OUT TO DIG IN HIS GARDEN AND HE DUG THERE THE WHOLE DAY LONG AND WHEN HE CAME IN IN THE EVENING THERE WAS THE HOP-ABOUT MAN SITTING IN HIS CHAIR
IN ONE HAND HE HELD A WHITE FLUFF-FEATHER
AND I MUST NOT SEEK FARTHER FOR THIS IS MARKET-DAY AND I MUST AWAY TO THE TOWN AND SHE BEGAN TO GATHER UP THE POTATOES AND DROP THEM INTO THE CART THUD THUD THUD

EVERY SUMMER THE LITTLE TOWN WHERE HANS LIVED WAS FULL OF STRANGERS
I RECKON I KIN TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE SO THE POSSUM AND LI'L HANNIBAL WENT ALONG TOGETHER THE POSSUM LOPING ALONG BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND LI'L HANNIBAL GOING VERY SLOWLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR HIS SHOES WERE FULL OF SAND AND IT HURT HIS TOES

AND IT WAS THE GOAT WHO HAD COME BACK AGAIN
HERE'S MY BREAKFAST AND SOME HAY FOR MY SHEEP
HE HURRIED DOWN THE HILL AND INTO THE VALLEY
NO OTHER TRIBE OF RED MEN DARED TO STAND BEFORE HIM
BUT AS HE CAME NEARER HE FOUND THE CLOUD WAS AS HARD AS A ROCK AND COVERED WITH A KIND OF DRY WHITE GRASS
BUT BESIDE THE GOAT THERE KNEELED A LITTLE GIRL
HIS MASTER THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD GET RID OF HIS OLD SERVANT THAT HE MIGHT SAVE THE COST OF HIS FOOD
WELL WELL SHE EXCLAIMED THAT RICH LORD HAS KEPT ALL FOR HIMSELF AND GIVEN ME NOTHING
THEN HE WENT INTO HIS FINE HOME BUT THAT WAS NO LONGER EMPTY FOR IN THE SEAT BY THE FIRESIDE SAT A LITTLE MAN IN A BLUE SMOCK AND FEATHER CAP
THERE THEY SAW ANOTHER PLACARD POSTED OVER THE DOOR OF THE GREAT HALLWAY
HE COULD THUS SEE HIS FRONT AND BACK AND EACH SIDE ALL AT THE SAME TIME
HE WALKED ALONG WITH A STICK IN HIS HAND AND AS HE WALKED HE COUNTED IN HIS MIND THE MILLIONS THAT HE HAD STORED AWAY IN HIS STRONG-BOX
IT ONLY MADE HIM SPEND MORE TIME AT THE MIRROR AS IT WAS NOW GETTING QUITE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF AT ALL
MY DEAR FRIEND RIVER COME TO MY ASSISTANCE OR I SHALL BE ROASTED THE RIVER RUSHED OUT AND QUENCHED THE FIRE AND COOLED THE OVEN

BUT GET OUT OF MY GROUNDS QUICKLY FULL OF JOY TEENCHY DUCK WENT OUT INTO THE ROAD SINGING
YOU ARE NOT FORGETTING YOUR GARTER OEYVIND CRIED AFTER HER
NO NOT YET SAID THE OLD MAN
EVERY DAY MANY STRANGERS CAME THERE
THEY WALKED SOME DISTANCE AND THEN NIGHT DARKENED DOWN AROUND THEM
AND JUST AS SHE FINISHED THE DOOR OPENED AND IN WALKED TWELVE OF THE QUEEREST LITTLE PEOPLE SHE HAD EVER SEEN
THEY ALL SEEM SO REAL SEE THE SPICE-BOX SAID JULIA
CATCH ME LOOKING AT POPGUNS SAID ROB SHORTLY
BUT WEE-WUN SAID
THEY DID NOT LOOK EITHER TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT
THE DAY AFTER CORALIE RETURNED HOME SHE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL
CATCH HIM SAID OL MISS GUINEA HEN BUT NO ONE DID IT
BUT THE LITTLE OLD MAN TOSSED IN HIS SLEEP AND HE SAID
AND HE TOOK THE AXE AND PUT IT INTO HIS POCKET
HE DID NOT SEE ANY SPORT IN KILLING POOR CREATURES
DEAR ME THOUGHT THE OLD MAN OPENING HIS EYES WIDE I CANNOT SEE ANY CLOTH BUT HE DID NOT SAY SO
WITH ITS FIERY BREATH THE CHIMAERA BURNED UP EVERYTHING THAT CAME NEAR IT
FOR MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS HE BRAVELY TOOK CARE OF HIS FATHER AND KEPT THE FIRE BURNING
SHE GLANCED AT THE NECKLACE AND SHUDDERED
WHEN MOLLY WAS GOING HOME THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS EXCHANGED SILVER SIXPENCES
FORGIVE ME THIS ONCE
WHAT BEAUTIFUL SILK HOW IT SHINES NO ONE WOULD ADMIT THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING FOR THAT WOULD HAVE PROVED HIM UNFIT FOR HIS OFFICE OR STUPID
THEY ARE SURE TO DIE DOWN THERE SOME CAT WILL GET THEM SAID A THIRD
BUT ALL THE TIME HE LAUGHED LAUGHED LAUGHED TILL HE WAS SCARCELY FIT TO STAND
THAT NIGHT THE HOBYAHS CAME AGAIN SKIPPING ALONG ON THE TIPS OF THEIR TOES AND THEY CALLED OUT
THE ROBBERS HEARING THE DREADFUL DIN WERE TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD TO THE WOODS
ON THEY SPED AGAIN NEVER STOPPING UNTIL THEY CAME TO A WRETCHED LITTLE HOVEL
SEE THERE JACK SAID PAUL
BUT CHRIF WOULD NOT TURN BACK
GRAZE GRAZE AWAY LITTLE OX WHILE I SPIN MY FLAX AND WHILE SHE SPUN HER HEAD DROPPED DOWN AND SHE DOZED
THEY SAID GOOD-BYE TO THEIR MOTHER THE EVENING STAR CROSSED THE GREAT DARK ARCHING SKY AND CAME TO THE DEEP CAVE WHERE LIVE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
THE SPLASHES OF MUD TOLD THEIR OWN STORY
BUT PETER AND PAUL STOOD STILL AND LAUGHED AT HIM AND CRIED GOOD-BYE MR WHY-AND-HOW AND WHAT DO YOU THINK JACK FOUND FAR UP ON THE GREAT ROCK
HE SCARCELY SAW THEM GO FOR HE WAS THINKING OF THE NIGHT SO NEAR AT HAND AND THE WINDS AND THE SNOW-SLIDES
EXCEPTING ONE HAPPY LITTLE BOY
IT IS BUILT OF WHITE STONES AND IT HAS SIX GLASS WINDOWS ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT
HURRAH
THE HARE SO WHEN HE HAD GOT THEM ALL SAFELY THE OLD MAN SAT DOWN ON A BENCH BEFORE THE CELLAR AND BEGAN SHARPENING A KNIFE
ROB THOUGHT NOW I GUESS HE'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BUT NO HE SOFTLY PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN AND STEPPED IN
VROUW VEDDER HUMMED A SLOW LITTLE TUNE OF HER OWN AS SHE WENT BACK INTO HER KITCHEN
HER SMALL PURSE WAS IN THE BOTTOM HOLDING HER SILVER SIXPENCE
BUT WHEN HE AWAKENED IN THE MORNING ALACK
THEY WALKED ALONG THE SHORE IN SILENCE
AND HOW FAST THEY RAN TO THE HOUSE
CHRIF DEAR CHRIF HE OPENED HIS EYES AND O JOY
IT WAS A PRECIOUS KEEPSAKE
BUT HE MADE KIT AND KAT SIT WITH THEIR FEET STUCK STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF THEM SO THAT THEY JUST REACHED TO THE EDGE--"SO THAT YOU CAN'T FALL IN SAID GRANDFATHER
I DO THIS FOR THE LOVE OF THE SON OF MARY HE SAID
SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME INTO HER MIND
BUT THE POTATO WAS AS COOL AS COOL
IF HE SAW AN ANIMAL IN TROUBLE OF ANY SORT HE ALWAYS STOPPED TO AID IT
THE LEAVES ARE SO MANY AND SO BIG THAT THEY SHUT OUT ALL THE SUNLIGHT AND THE ROOMS OF THE PALACE ARE DARK EVEN IN MIDDAY WELL WHAT OF THAT ASKED PETER
NORTH WIND DID NOT WAKEN HIM AS THE INNKEEPER TOOK THE TABLE AND THE TABLECLOTH AND CARRIED THEM DOWNSTAIRS
HERE ARE THE BREECHES
IT SEEMED TO BE SOME TINY CREATURE NOT FAR AWAY TRYING TO MOVE ABOUT
THE TSAR WAS WROTH AND DROVE THEM FROM COURT WITH DISHONOUR
A WOLF THEY EXCLAIMED EXCITEDLY
LET US RETURN TO THE SHIP SAID MANY
WHAT WAS I TO DO WITH IT ASKED CHRIF
NOW THERE IS ONE THING QUITE CERTAIN SAID HEIGH-HEAVY AND THAT IS THAT YOU SHALL NEVER MARRY MY DAUGHTER SO-SMALL
THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE CRIED IN A MOST PITIFUL FASHION
THE TIME CAME WHEN THE SON OF THE CHIEF MUST TAKE THE TEST
AT LAST THE DAY OF EXECUTION CAME AND DAMON WAS LED OUT TO BE PUT TO DEATH
NOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU OLD WHISKERS SAID THE DONKEY
AND WHEN ANDERS CAME BOTH THE MUSKETS WERE LEVELLED AT HIM
HE WAS A TALL FIERCE FIGURE WITH BRIGHTLY PAINTED BODY AND BRILLIANT HEADDRESS OF FEATHERS
AS HE FELT HIS WAY BACK TO HIS COUCH HE KNOCKED OVER ONE OF THE GOLDEN JARS WHICH HAD HELD THE LIQUID PERFUME BUT THE PERFUME WAS ALL GONE NOW AND ONLY AN EMPTY JAR ROLLED OVER THE FLOOR
WHEN CHRIF AND ANDY ENTERED THE PALACE THEY SAW THE PRINCESS UPON HER THRONE
THE WHITE BEAR RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD AND JUMPED UPON THE FIRE WITH HIS WET FEET AND ROLLED UPON IT
SHE WAS A SKILLED WORKER AND FOUND WORK TO DO AWAY FROM HOME BUT HER TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE SO GOOD AND SO HELPFUL THAT THEY KEPT HER HOUSE AS NEAT AND AS BRIGHT AS A NEW PIN
YOU HAVE A FINE VOICE AND WE ARE ALL MUSICIANS THE ROOSTER WAS GLAD TO GO AND ALL FOUR WENT ON TOGETHER
FORTUNATELY TEENCHY DUCK SAW THE DANGER AND CRIED OUT
YOU ASK
AND THE OLD MAN SOLD THE SHEEP AND OXEN AND GOT SO RICH THAT HE NEEDED NOTHING MORE
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN HE WOULD NOT CONFESS IMMEDIATELY
THEY HAD A GRAND SUPPER
HE WANTED TO HEAR STORIES ABOUT WHAT WAS FAR AWAY FOR NOW THE GOAT NO LONGER SATISFIED HIM
AND THERE IS ADDED A NEW FIELD AS A SOURCE FOR STORIES
GAVIN TRIED TO READ HIS BOOK BUT CHRIF LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD
SOME WERE ANGRY AND WANTED EVEN NOW TO KILL THE POOR WOLF JUST AS THE DOGS DID WHICH WERE PROWLING ABOUT SNARLING WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
THERE WERE NO BRIDGES AND SO THE STREAMS MUST BE FORDED
NOTHING BUT TOYS
BUT THE LAD WAS SLENDER AND WHITE-FACED
BETTER AND BETTER SAID PETER
ITS VALUE IN THE HOME AND IN THE SCHOOL IS ASSURED
BUT TO CHRIF HE SEEMED TO SAY
HE RAN SO FAST THAT THE PRINCESS'S NECKLACE FELL OFF HIS NECK AND ALL THE CAKES JUMPED OUT OF HIS POCKETS
THE BLOCK WAS A SENSIBLE CHOICE SAID HER MAMMA BUT I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CHOSE THE VASE I DIDN'T CHOOSE EITHER OF THEM MOLLY BURST OUT
HERE IS MY BEAUTIFUL MONEY ON HER WAY HOME SHE RETURNED THE FRIENDS THAT HAD AIDED HER TO THE PLACES WHERE SHE HAD FOUND THEM THANKING THEM KINDLY FOR THEIR HELP IN TIME OF NEED
FIREWORKS WERE BEING SET OFF IN THE PUBLIC SQUARES
SEE YOUR MAJESTY HOW FINE IS THE TEXTURE
BUT WHEN THE KING CAME NEARER TO HIM WITH HIS GOLD CROWN BETWEEN HIS HANDS THEN HE GREW FRIGHTENED AS NEVER BEFORE FOR A KING CAN DO WHAT HE LIKES AND HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO CHEAT HIM OUT OF HIS CAP IF HE DID NOT TAKE GOOD CARE
I WAS TO TAKE IT HOME TO RHODA THAT MOMENT THE LITTLE BIRD BURST OPEN THE PEARL DOOR
AND KAT SAID I SEE MOTHER AT THE GATE GRANDFATHER GAVE THE FISH HE CAUGHT TO KIT AND KAT AND VROUW VEDDER COOKED IT FOR THEIR SUPPER
AT LAST AS THEY WERE MARCHING THROUGH THE LAND ONE DAY THEY CAME UPON A PLACE WHERE FOUR ROADS MET
A WHITE CARD HUNG ABOVE IT AND ON THIS CARD WAS PRINTED IN LARGE BLACK LETTERS
HIS SON-IN-LAW HAD ASKED THAT BELLEROPHON SHOULD BE KILLED
THEN HE TOOK A BITE OF THE MAPLE SUGAR
I WAS ONCE THE CHIEF'S SON
THERE WAS NO OTHER SOUND
WANG CHIH WAS NOT LIKELY TO FORGET THE FEAST OF LANTERNS FOR THE CHILDREN HAD TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH AND HE PROMISED TO COME HOME AS EARLY AS HE COULD
SO YOU SEE THAT IT WAS VERY LUCKY THAT THE WALL WAS THERE
WHEN HE GOT THERE HE SAT DOWN ON A TUFT OF GRASS NEAR THE CAVE AND CONSIDERED WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT
BUT THEN HE ASKED IF THE SKY DID NOT TALK TO ANY ONE
EVEN IN THE MOST CROWDED DAY HE FOUND TIME TO BE MERCIFUL
HE ENDED IN THIS WAY
OH LI'L HANNIBAL FETCH A PINE KNOT AND LIGHT THE KITCHEN FIRE OH LI'L HANNIBAL FETCH THE TEA-KETTLE TO THE WELL AND GET SOME WATER FOR THE TEA OH LI'L HANNIBAL MIX A LI'L HOECAKE FOR YOUR GRAN'DADDY'S BREA'FUS OH LI'L HANNIBAL TAKE THE BUNCH OF TURKEYS FEATHERS AND DUST THE HEARTH AND FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT LI'L HANNIBAL'S GRAN'DADDY KEPT HIM DOIN THINGS TOO
DANCING WAS GOING ON BUT THE PRINCESS DID NOT DANCE
THE STRAW OX_[12 R
A FAIRY-TALE OF FINLAND NOW PETER WAS BIG FAT RED-FACED AND SLOW
THE RIVERS POURED OVER THE CLOUD-ROCK UNTIL THERE WAS NOT A SPARK LEFT ALIGHT AND RUSHED DOWN THROUGH THE SKY INTO THE SEA BELOW
SANTA CLAUS THEN STRAPPED ROB AND THE BASKET ON HIS BACK
BUT NOW I AM A BIRD
THE FOX MEANTIME HAD PROFITED BY THE ABSENCE OF THE HOUSEHOLDERS TO MAKE A GOOD MEAL VISITING THE VARIOUS LARDERS AND FEASTING AT WILL ON THE DAINTIEST MORSELS HE COULD FIND
SO HE PICK HIS CHANCE ONE DAY WHILES OLE MISS RABBIT EN DE LITTLE RABS IS OUT PICKIN SALLID FOR DINNER
OH-I-AM HAD HIDDEN THE SPELL IN HIS CUPBOARD
THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY WERE TAKING THE CLOTH FROM THE LOOM
YOU MIGHT EASILY MISS YOUR WAY MY BOY SAID THE HUNTER IF YOU WILL SHOW ME THE WAY I WILL PAY YOU WELL HANS SHOOK HIS HEAD
SHE JERKED IT SO HARD THAT ONE FOOT FLEW RIGHT UP IN THE AIR AND ONE OF HER NEW WOODEN SHOES WENT--SPLASH!--RIGHT INTO THE WATER
GO OUT OF THIS HOUSE INSTANTLY AND DON'T DARE TO COME BACK UNTIL YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME THE PURSE OF GOLD POOR TEENCHY DUCK TREMBLED IN ALL HER LIMBS AND MADE HERSELF SMALL AND HUMBLE
I COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE SAID LINCOLN
HAS THE FOX TAKEN IT AH IF IT ONLY WERE THE FOX ARE YOU MAD SAID HIS MOTHER
BUT WHEN THE CAT SAW THE BOAR'S BRISTLES STICKING OUT FROM BEHIND THE BUSHES HE THOUGHT IT WAS A MOUSE AND PUT UP HIS BACK AGAIN AND CRIED
THE YOUNGEST BROTHER DISCHARGED HIS ARROW AND THE ARROW FELL INTO A MUDDY SWAMP AND A QUACKING-FROG SEIZED HOLD OF IT
ARRIVED AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY HE SCAMPERED OFF WITHOUT A WORD OF THANKS AND AS HE MADE A HEARTY SUPPER ON THE REMAINING FISH HE CHUCKLED AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE TRICK HE HAD PLAYED THE STUPID WOLF
THE HARE NOW ALONE REMAINED AND THE OLD MAN BEGAN SHARPENING HIS KNIFE ON THE HARE'S ACCOUNT
AT EVERY CORNER HE HELD HIS BREATH HALF EXPECTING TO RUN INTO SANTA HIMSELF
52 FAIRY TALES FROM CHINA
SANTA CLAUS CAN'T BEAR TO SEE LITTLE FOLKS IN TROUBLE SO HE TOOK THE BOY INTO HIS ARMS AND ASKED HIM WHERE HE WANTED TO GO
AS HE RODE HOME IN THIS WAY HE HUMMED TO HIMSELF A SLY LITTLE SONG TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WHO WAS HURT CARRIED HIM WHO HAD NO HURT
SHALL I GO WITH YOU I AM WILLING SAID TEENCHY DUCK
BRER RABBIT HOLLER HEYO HOUSE
THEY SAW THE GREAT OAK THAT DARKENED THE WINDOWS AND ON THE GATEPOSTS THEY SAW A BIG POSTER PRINTED IN RED AND BLACK LETTERS
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF PYTHIAS DOES NOT RETURN I WILL DIE FOR HIM SAID DAMON
THERE IS A FINE RAIN-STORM OUT AT SEA THEY SAID TO EACH OTHER
OF COURSE THEY WERE IMPOSTORS BUT THEY PUT TOGETHER TWO LOOMS AND BEGAN TO MOVE ABOUT AS IF THEY WERE WORKING THOUGH THEY HAD NOTHING WHATEVER ON THE LOOMS
NO SOONER THOUGHT THAN DONE
ANY SPECIAL PLACE YOU BOUN FOR I DON'T RECKON SO SAID LI'L HANNIBAL FOR HE WAS GETTING TIRED AND HE HAD COME AWAY WITHOUT ANY BREAKFAST
AGAIN HE FELL ASLEEP AND AGAIN THE SAME VOICE AWOKE HIM
THEN HE HEARD UPON THE FLOOR A CLATTER AND A RUSTLE AND THEN A STEPPING NOISE--ONE TWO
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OH HE IS ALWAYS WONDERING SAID PETER
HE KNEW NOTHING OF CHILDREN AND THEIR WAYS
HE WAS KEPT THERE THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO ASTRAY
THERE WERE ALSO ON THE SAME CARD A TENNIS RACKET AND A HOOP AND A DEAR LITTLE DOLL'S CARRIAGE FOR THE RAG-DOLL CHILDREN TO PLAY WITH AND A SHOPPING-BAG AND A GREEN WATERING-POT
OVER THE THRONE WAS A PEARL CLOCK
ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT IS YOURS RHOECUS GAZED AT THE DRYAD WITH WONDER AND AWE
HOWEVER HE TOOK OFF HIS SHOES TURNED UP HIS TROUSERS AND WADED ACROSS
OH DEAR HE REPLIED
SHE RAN AND TOLD HER OLD MAN AND HER OLD MAN CAME AND THREW THE WOLF INTO THE CELLAR ALSO
HER TEARS WENT DRIP-DRIP AS SHE STARTED TO GATHER HER POTATOES TOGETHER
IT WAS TOO LARGE FOR DOLLS AND TOO SMALL FOR PEOPLE AND TOO UGLY TO PLEASE EITHER
AND WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER STORY THE DWARFS GATHERED LOVINGLY ROUND HER AND SAID
PART OF THE LAND WAS MARKED GOOD PART OF IT BAD
THE KING LOOKED DOWN AND SAW AN ANT HILL IN THE PATH BEFORE THEM
HOW IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED TO BE TAKING DOUBLE PORTIONS OF EVERY DISH THEN THE MOON STEPPED FORWARD
I AM IN SUCH PAIN THAT I CAN SCARCELY KEEP STILL LOOK AT MY HEAD RETURNED THE FOX WHO HAD CAREFULLY DIPPED IT INTO A FLOUR BIN AFTER GREASING IT WITH BUTTER THAT IT MIGHT HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN SKINNED
A NEW IDEA SEIZED THE YOUNG PRINCE AND TAKING UP ONE OF THE GOLDEN JARS HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND STRUCK ON ONE OF ITS CHEQUERED PANES OF GLASS WITH ALL HIS FORCE
BUT AFTER A TIME THE CHESS-PLAYERS ATE ONE EACH AND PUT ONE IN WANG CHIH'S MOUTH

HE KNEW THE WAY FOR HE HAD BEEN TO THE INN ONLY THE SUMMER BEFORE WITH HIS UNCLE

NOBODY EVEN SAW THE LITTLE BOY IN HOLIDAY CLOTHES WHO TIPTOED SO QUIETLY OVER THE BEAUTIFUL CARPETS
HER DECK WAS CROWDED WITH LADS

AND HE FORGOT FOR A MOMENT HOW TIRED HE WAS THINKING HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WAS TO SIT DOWN TO A SUPPER OF APPLE-PIE
A TALE OF THE PENOBSCOT INDIANS GLOOSKAP WAS VERY PROUD OF WHAT HE HAD DONE
AND AFTER HE HAD SEEN THAT NO ONE HAD DROPPED ANOTHER PAIR OF LITTLE BLUE SHOES HE HUNG OVER THE STIR-ABOUT WIFE'S WALL AND LOOKED AT HER GARDEN AND WHEN HE SAW THE BLUE BLOW-AWAYS HE LAUGHED SO THAT HE FELL UPON THE GROUND
THE WINTERS ARE VERY COLD IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HANS LIVED
I KNOW SAID THE BABA-YAGA
IT IS ON THE TOP OF A PILLAR NOT FAR FROM THE COAST
A PATH OF GOLD LAY ACROSS THE WATER
ON THE TENTH DAY HE GAVE HIS LETTERS TO THE KING
YOU SHALL SEEK YOUR SCANTY FOOD WITH PAIN
AND WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THIS HE TOOK A GOLD-PIECE FROM HIS PURSE AND GAVE IT TO HANS
SEE YONDER LITTLE PEOPLE HE SAID
HE HAD NO SOONER SUNG THIS SONG THAN THE DOOR WHICH WEE-WUN HAD LEFT OPEN JUMPED OFF ITS HINGES AND RAN ABOUT THE FLOOR AND THE WOOD WHICH HE HAD THROWN INTO THE CORNER FLEW OUT AND RUSHED ABOUT TOO
KNOCK AND THIS DOOR WILL OPEN CHRIF KNOCKED ONCE AND THE DOOR FLEW OPEN
AND HE STROKED HIS HEAD GENTLY
THE SECOND BROTHER DISCHARGED HIS ARROW AND IT FLEW INTO THE COURT OF A MERCHANT AND REMAINED STICKING IN A BEAUTIFUL BALCONY AND ON THIS BALCONY WAS STANDING A LOVELY YOUNG MAIDEN SOUL THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
THEY ALL SAT DOWN ON THE END OF THE PIER
THE LITTLE OLD MAN WAS VERY SORRY WHEN HE FOUND THAT THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WAS GONE
FEW CHILDREN FAIL TO MAKE THE IMMEDIATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HERO OR HEROINE OF THE STORY AND THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THIS GREAT PRINCIPLE OF IMITATION A LARGE NUMBER OF THE STORIES IN THIS LITTLE VOLUME HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR THEIR MORAL VALUE
AND STILL THE OLD MAN WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DOORWAY WATCHING IT ALL
NOW ONE DAY THE TSAREVICH WAITED HIS OPPORTUNITY RAN OFF HOME FOUND THE FROG-SKIN AND THREW IT INTO A GREAT FIRE

AND HE PUT THE LITTLE SHOES INTO HIS POCKET AND FLEW AWAY
YOU CAN'T WAKE HIM UP SAID THE WIND

BASED UPON THE STORY OF JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL'S POEM OF THE SAME NAME ONE DAY RHOECUS WAS PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD
A PICTURE WAS ON ITS SIDE
THE FIRST PERSON HE MET WAS A FARM LABOURER WALKING ALONGSIDE A LOAD OF PEAT AND SMACKING AT HIS HORSE
AND THE EVENING BEGAN TO GROW DARKER
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE LITTLE SPY O DEAR SANTA CLAUS CRIED ROBBY HUGGING THE RED BOOTS DO JUST TAKE ME ALONG WITH YOU
THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES WERE HUNG WITH LANTERNS
DUST UNDER THE RUG MAUD LINDSAY THERE WAS ONCE A MOTHER WHO HAD TWO LITTLE DAUGHTERS
THEN HE RAN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND SOON OVERTOOK HIS BROTHERS
HIS FRIENDS RODE ON BUT HE RETURNED
WHEN HE CAME TO THE PINE GROVE BY THE SCHOOLHOUSE THE SHADOWS CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE TREES AND FOLLOWED HIM AND THAT WAS MUCH WORSE THAN SEEING THE SCHOOLMISTRESS
WHO IS HE ASKED GLOOSKAP
HE SEEMS GENTLE ENOUGH BUT HE MIGHT DO SOME HARM
IF YOU ARE GOOD YOU SHALL RIDE SAID HANS'S AUNT AS SHE HURRIED HIM ON TO THE PLACE WHERE THE STRONG MEN OF THE VILLAGE WERE LIFTING GREAT STONES TO SHOW THEIR STRENGTH
FOOTNOTE 13
GIVE HIM MY DRUM WHISPERED ROB AND SANTA CLAUS WITHOUT A WORD PLACED IT NEAR THE RUMPLED HEAD
SO THE EMPEROR STRUTTED FORWARD IN THE PROCESSION UNDER A SPLENDID CANOPY AND THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS AND AT THE WINDOWS SAID HOW GRAND ARE THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
THE TWINS OPENED THEIR EYES AND SAT UP
AND HE WISHED THAT HIS AUNT WOULD REMEMBER ABOUT THE MERRY-GO-ROUND
ALL THE TRAVELLERS WHO CAME IN THE SUMMER TO SEE THE MOUNTAINS SAID SO AND EVEN HANS'S AUNT THOUGHT SO ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT LOVE THE DOG
HER BOATS WERE SMALL BUT THEY SOMETIMES WENT FARTHER THAN CHRIF'S
I WAS COUNTING THE COWS JUST NOW AND THERE HE WAS
BUT WHEN THE POTATO-WIFE HAD GONE ON HER WAY HE FLEW OFF TO HIS BROWN HOUSE BY THE BROWN BRAMBLE
THOSE PAPER PACKAGES MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EVEN RARER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE PAPER DOLLS OR THE FURNITURE OR THE PINK STUFF
WHY MR SHAGGY MATTHEW HOW D'YE DO
THEY STOOD HELPLESS LOOKING FIRST AT THE COIL OF ROPE AT THEIR FEET AND THEN AT THEIR FRIEND HIGH IN THE AIR
SHE WAS VERY PLEASANT WITH KIND GREY EYES
CYANT HAVE NO SUPPER CATCH HIM
ON AND ON THEY WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE SUNSET
CHOP YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE CHIPS FLY
I SHALL TELL THE LITTLE CHILDREN WHEN SPRING HAS COME
BUT MORNING SEEMED VERY FAR AWAY TO THE DOG'S ANXIOUS LITTLE MASTER AND THE BIG TEARS BEGAN TO ROLL DOWN HIS CHEEKS
REGIMENTS OF SOLDIERS ARMED TO THE TEETH
THEY FILLED HIS STOCKING AND HURRIED AWAY FOR EMPTY LITTLE STOCKINGS THE WORLD OVER WERE WAITING FOR THAT GENEROUS HAND
ON THE MORROW WEE-WUN THE GNOME CAME FLYING OVER THE BYE-BYE MEADOW JUST AS CARELESS AS EVER
NATHAN COULD JUST SEE THE BLACK SHAPES OF THE COWS
THAT I WILL SAID CHRIF
BUT HE HAS JUST EATEN MY BREAD SAID THE KING OF LYCIA
THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF
TOMMY TURNER WAS WRITTEN AT THE TOP AND JUST BELOW WAS A LITTLE MAP,--YES THERE WAS TOMMY'S HEART MAPPED OUT LIKE A COUNTRY
OL MISS GUINEA HEN WAS ALMOST THE BUSIEST OF THE WHOLE COMPANY FOR SHE WAS LAYING EGGS
THEN THE STAR TURNED TO THE MOON AND SAID
OF THE HORNS AND THEN HE COULD HEAR THE THUD OF THE HORSES HOOFS AND THE YELP OF THE HOUNDS
THERE ARE THREE TASKS INSTEAD OF ONE AND THE PRIZE IS MORE THAN DOUBLE BUT IT WILL TAKE SOMEONE SMARTER THAN YOU TO WIN IT SAID PAUL
FRRRRRRR THEN THEY WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN EVER
SO HE TOOK THE ROAD TO A GREAT CITY WHERE HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THE STREET BAND PLAY
THE TSAREVICH ENTERED IN AND SAW THE BONY-LEGGED BABA-YAGA LYING ON THE STOVE ON NINE BRICKS AND GRINDING HER TEETH
THERE WAS A CRY OF ADMIRATION AT SIGHT OF THE NECKLACE
BUT THE LITTLE SHOES TOOK NO NOTICE AT ALL
THEN HE GOT UPON HIS FEET AND HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE KNIFE AND FORK AND PULLED AND PULLED AND PULLED

YOU MUST BE HUNGRY TOO POOR LITTLE THING SAID HE AS HE PUT PART OF THE APPLE INTO THE BIRD'S CAGE
NEARLY EVERYONE LOVED BELLEROPHON
THE INCULCATION OF A DUTY LEAVES HIM PASSIONLESS AND UNMOVED
HE LISTENED EAGERLY
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BREAKING OF TWIGS AND THE RUSTLING OF LEAVES UNDER THE HEAVY STEP OF THE COWS
THEN SHE THOUGHT OF IT FOR IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE COULD HEAR THE STARS SAYING
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO MIGHT WANT TO BUY HIM ARE YOU GOING TO SELL HIM ASKED HANS
NOW AN OLD MOTHER-WOLF WAS OUT TAKING HER EVENING WALK ON THE MOUNTAIN AFTER TENDING HER CUBS IN THE DEN ALL DAY
THE GUESTS WERE ALL TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND RUSHED FROM THEIR PLACES AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO
I DID WANT THE PAPER DOLL FURNITURE SO MUCH SHE ENDED
THEY PLAYED UNTIL THE SHADOWS OF THE DYKE GREW VERY LONG ACROSS THE SANDY BEACH AND THEN GRANDFATHER SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME
BUT THE LITTLE OLD MAN HEARD TURPIE AND HE SAT UP IN BED AND HE SAID
THEN LITTLE JACK CAME FORWARD
IT RAN OVER INTO THE KING'S GARDEN

WHEN THEY HAD COME TO THE MIDDLE OF IT DOWN FLEW THE FAIRY AND IN A MINUTE MORE THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS STANDING ON THE GREEN GRASS BESIDE A BEAUTIFUL PINK MARBLE PALACE THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE A GOOD-SIZED SUMMER-HOUSE
BOW-WOW HE BARKED LOUD AND LONG BOW-WOW
HE'S A FINE LITTLE FELLOW AND PERHAPS HE WILL DO BETTER NEXT YEAR IF I GIVE HIM THE HORSE THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR OUR BOY
AH THOUGHT THE PRINCE HERE I CAN LOUNGE AT MY EASE WITH NO ONE TO CALL ME TO STUPID LESSONS WONDERFULLY CARVED JARS AND VASES OF GOLD AND SILVER STOOD ABOUT ON THE FLOOR AND EACH WAS FILLED WITH A DIFFERENT PERFUME
PERHAPS PERHAPS SAID HE SOFTLY I MAY YET SEE THE LIGHT AGAIN
HER OARS WERE IN PLACE
WHEN HER MASTER LEARNED THE VALUE OF WHAT TEENCHY DUCK HAD FOUND AND THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED ON HER BY THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS HE WENT INTO A RAGE
AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER RED EXCEPT A SMALL PART IN THE MIDDLE WHICH WAS GREEN FOR THE RED YARN HAD GIVEN OUT
THE BOYS WENT INTO THE COURTYARD
WHEN HER GRANDMOTHER CAME FROM THE BERRY PASTURE RHODA TOLD HER WHERE CHRIF HAD GONE
AND SHE SAID TO KAT
IT IS THE MIGHTY WASIS
OH HE CRIED IN THAT HOUSE IS A HORRIBLE WOMAN WHO FLEW AT ME AND SCRATCHED ME DOWN THE FACE WITH HER LONG FINGERS
BUT PRINCE HARWEDA SAW ONLY THE FLOOD OF SUNSHINE THAT POURED IN AND THE BEAUTY OF THE LARGE LANDSCAPE

BETWEEN A ROW OF POPLAR-TREES A PATH LED TO THE DOOR

BELLEROPHON LOST HIS SEAT AND FELL TO THE EARTH
VERY WELL I WILL COME AND LOOK AT YOUR BLUE BLOW-AWAY AND HE SET OFF AT ONCE
HE GOT LONELY OFTEN HIMSELF FOR THERE WAS NOBODY TO PLAY WITH HIM AT HIS OWN HOME AND HIS AUNT DID NOT ENCOURAGE HIM TO PLAY WITH OTHER CHILDREN
SANTA CLAUS ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE LED OFF TO THE PILE OF HORSES
YES INDEED SAID THE MAN
TEENCHY DUCK MADE HERSELF HEARD ALL DAY AND AT NIGHT THE PRINCE SAID TO HIS SERVANTS
SMOKING HOT THEY ALL WERE TOO FOR THE DISHES WERE TIGHTLY COVERED
EVERY STREET WAS BLAZING WITH LIGHTS
THAT HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF
I SHALL REMEMBER THE LESSON
THE TWO OLD MEN SAT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE GROUND AND THE CHESSBOARD RESTED ON A SLAB LIKE A STONE TABLE BETWEEN THEM
BRER FOX DODGE HE DID EN DEN HE PUT OUT FER DE WOODS WID BRER WOLF RIGHT AT HIS HEELS
WHAT HAVE I DONE HE CRIED
A LOW BARREN CLIFF OVERHUNG THE HOUSE IN WHICH HE WAS BORN
AND NOW THAT THOU ART OLD AND GREY AND WEAK SHALL I NOT RENDER THE SAME LOVE AND CARE TO THEE
HE WAS THINKING OF THE SNUG KITCHEN AND THE GOOD WARM SUPPER THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD HAVE READY FOR HIM
IT TASTED GOOD EVEN IF IT WAS SANDY
AFTER THAT THEY LIVED TOGETHER FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WERE VERY VERY HAPPY
HE STOPPED TO SPEAK TO AN OLD SQUAW
TEENCHY DUCK CAME UP THE ROUNDS SINGING
I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING AT PRESENT SAID THE LADDER SHALL I GO WITH YOU YES SAID TEENCHY DUCK
IT WAS VERY PLEASANT
THEY WERE AN OLD GRANDMOTHER

THEY HAD BEEN SPENDING A WEEK TOGETHER AT THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S
YOU MAY KEEP THAT HE WENT OVER TO HER AND TAKING HER HAND SAID
THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THEM YES NODDED THE COURTIERS ALTHOUGH THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THERE BEING NOTHING THERE
SO HE CAUGHT AILBE UP IN HIS ARMS KICKING AND SQUEALING AND BITING LIKE THE WILD LITTLE ANIMAL HE WAS AND WRAPPED HIM IN A CORNER OF HIS GREAT CLOAK
WHY NOT GO YOURSELF FOR HIM NOW WAS THE THOUGHT
AND HERE HE LEARNED ALL THE THINGS WHICH IN THOSE DAYS MADE A LITTLE BOY GROW UP INTO A WISE AND GREAT MAN
THEN THERE WAS A GREAT FESTIVAL IN THE TOWN AND THE AUNT TOOK THE CHAIN FROM ITS WRAPPINGS AND FASTENED IT ABOUT HANS'S NECK WITH A RIBBON
YES IT IS INDEED BEAUTIFUL HE REPORTED TO THE EMPEROR
BUT LOOK

A LITTLE HAND RESTED IN BLESSING UPON THE GIANT'S BOWED HEAD
SECOND IMPRESSION

BUT THERE WAS THE HOP-ABOUT MAN AND HE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE NOT ONE BIT

BUT WHEN HE SAW HOW TATTERED THE BOY'S JACKET WAS HE SAID MORE SOFTLY P'R'APS YOU'D LIKE A BISCUIT ONLY TRY ME SAID THE SHRILL LITTLE VOICE
STILL THIS DID NOT ALARM HIM VERY MUCH AS HE CARED NOTHING FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD
WHEN THE CHAIN CAME THE AUNT CALLED ALL THE NEIGHBOURS TO SEE IT

BEHIND THIS DOOR IS THE POT OF GOLD
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE IT KNOWN THAT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING

BY STEPHEN SOUTHWOLD
NOW THAT I AM OLD AND GROWING WEAKER AND WEAKER AND AM NOT ABLE TO HUNT ANY MORE MY MASTER HAS ORDERED THAT I SHOULD BE KILLED
THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
ALL BEFORE HIM WAS BLANK DARKNESS AS BLACK AS THE DARKEST NIGHT YOU EVER SAW
HE HAD BEEN BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CAVE AS HE HAD NOT WAITED TO HAVE HIS MIDDAY MEAL WITH THE OTHER FIELD WORKERS
CORALIE'S MOTHER BEGAN TO EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR THEIR COMING
THEN SHE RAN IN HASTE TO MAKE UP THE BEDS AND WASH THE DISHES
THIS IS JUST WHAT WE WANT
THEN HE SAID
BELLEROPHON WAS BRAVE
BUT SUDDENLY THE BISHOP'S HEART STOOD STILL
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE NOT TOLD US LAUGHED THE LITTLE GIRLS
MY SON COULD NOT KILL MEN NOR BEASTS
CHRIF GAVIN AND A BOY NAMED ANDY WERE AMONG THEM
WITH THE HELP OF PEGASUS HE EASILY SLEW THE MONSTER
OH-I-AM LOOKED STERN AND STRAIGHT IN HIS BROWN ROBE WHICH TRAILED BEHIND HIM
HE WATCHED THE BEES BUZZING AMONG THE FLOWERS THE BUTTERFLIES FLUTTERING IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THE BIRDS BUILDING THEIR NESTS IN THE TREES
DUST UNDER THE RUG SAID THE LITTLE VOICE IN MINNIE'S HEART AND SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
FOOTNOTE 16

HE WAS A WONDERFUL HUNTER AND A FIERCE ENEMY
IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD TWELVE TIGERS SAID THE HOP-ABOUT MAN SO IT CAN EASILY HOLD TWO LITTLE GNOMES
HIS ROSY MOUTH WAS PUCKERED INTO SOMETHING BETWEEN A WHISTLE AND A SMILE
BEYOND THE SETTING OF THE SUN LIES THE NEW LAND
BELLEROPHON IF YOU CAN RIDE PEGASUS YOU WILL KILL THE CHIMAERA EASILY WHAT IS PEGASUS SAID BELLEROPHON
SHE OFTEN MAKES ME ILL MERLIN'S FACE LOOKED SO STERN THAT CORALIE HID HER FACE UNDER HER MOTHER'S CLOAK
BRYANT

AND THE GOOD BISHOP WAS TRUE TO HER
THEN HE GALLOPED AFTER THE OTHERS
BUT AS SOON AS A BOUGH WAS CUT OFF TWO BIGGER AND STRONGER ONES GREW IN ITS PLACE
BUT THE HUNTER CARRIED LITTLE AILBE HOME WITH HIM ON THE HORSE'S BACK
THE THIRD NIGHT THE HOBYAHS CAME AGAIN SKIPPING ALONG ON THE TIPS OF THEIR TOES AND THEY CALLED OUT
I AM GETTING OLD AND MY TEETH ARE ONLY STUMPS
OH THAT IS MY SECRET REPLIED THE WISE OLD HARE
HE COULD FEEL IT THUMP THUMP THUMP AGAINST HIS JACKET

ALL DE CREETURS HEAR BOUT IT EN DEY GO ROUN EN SAY DAT BRER RABBIT SHOLY IS GOT DEZE ERE THINGS UP HERE UNCLE REMUS TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD AND THE LITTLE BOY LAUGHED
PAUL WAS SLENDER AWKWARD AND ILL-NATURED

SHE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LIARS IN THE WORLD
THE BOAT WAS FILLED WITH EARTH
I MUST BE STUPID OR UNFIT TO BE EMPEROR
THE CEILING WAS OF MOTHER-OF-PEARL WITH TINTS OF RED AND BLUE AND YELLOW AND GREEN ALL BLENDING INTO GLEAMING WHITE AS ONLY MOTHER-OF-PEARL CAN

WHEN IT FALLS I DIE
THERE WAS A BIG COMPANY THERE--BR'ER RABBIT AND BR'ER PARTRIDGE AND BR'ER ROBIN AND OL MISS GUINEA HEN
BUT OF COURSE IT WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND
HE DREAMED THAT ATHENE HERSELF STOOD BY HIM
OVER NINETEEN HUNDRED YEARS
FEW TRAVELLERS GO TO THE MOUNTAINS THEN
WHEN THE PRINCE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS LEFT OF TEENCHY DUCK SHE MET HIM AND BEGAN TO REPEAT HER FAMILIAR SONG
THEY WRAPPED HIM IN A PIECE OF CLOTH AND TOOK HIM UP ON THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE AND THERE THEY LEFT HIM LYING ALL ALONE ON A BUSH OF HEATHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR NEARLY A MONTH HE REMEMBERED THE BIRD IN THE GILDED CAGE
THE FROG HAD GOT THE BREAD READY LONG AGO AND IT WAS SO SPLENDID THAT THE LIKE OF IT IS NEITHER TO BE IMAGINED NOR GUESSED AT BUT IS ONLY TO BE TOLD OF IN TALES
BUT THE CHILDREN TEASED HER
WHEN SATAN SAW THE CROSS HE TURNED HIS ARMY AND MARCHED QUICKLY AWAY
BUT THERE WAS ONE MAN WHO DID NOT LIKE HIM
I SHOULD ASK HER HELP BELLEROPHON PRAYED IN THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE AND THEN FELL ASLEEP
HE LAY THERE FOR A LONG LONG TIME
THEN BY THE DOOR STOOD A MAN WITH A KNIFE WHO STABBED ME IN THE LEG AND OUT IN THE YARD LAY A MONSTER WHO STRUCK ME A HARD BLOW WITH A HUGE CLUB
MOTHER WAS I STUPID BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
WHY DO YOU DO THAT ASKED PUSS AND HE REPLIED
DO YOU THINK HE LEFT THE REMNANT OF HIS STOCKING ON THE CHIMNEY-TOP
OH IT IS LOVELY MOST LOVELY ANSWERED THE OLD MINISTER LOOKING THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES
MINNIE TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT IT
THE BISHOP WAS COMING DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET ON HIS WAY FROM CHURCH WHEN THE SOUNDS OF HORNS CAME OVER THE HILLS CLOSE BY AND HE KNEW THE CHASE WAS NEARING HOME
NOW IT SEEMED CLOSE AND STUFFY AND HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE GIVEN IT ALL FOR THE HUMBLEST HOME IN HIS FATHER'S KINGDOM WHERE HE COULD MEET PEOPLE AND HEAR THEM TALK AND SEE THEM SMILE AT EACH OTHER EVEN IF THEY SHOULD TAKE NO NOTICE OF HIM
I DONE RUN AWAY BR'ER POSSUM
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST OF IT
WON'T YOU GIVE ME A TASTE LITTLE BROTHER HE ASKED
WITH A CRY OF JOY SHE BOUNDED UP TO HIM AND LAID HER HEAD UPON HIS BREAST AS IF SHE KNEW HE WOULD PROTECT HER FROM THE GROWLING DOGS AND THE FIERCE-EYED HUNTERS

ON A RAGGED COT LAY THE URCHIN TO WHOM ROBBY HAD GIVEN THE BISCUITS
HIS FACE WAS BRIGHT WITH GLAD UNSELFISH JOY OVER THE BIRD'S LIBERTY
THEY CAN'T SAID JACK
THEN HE JUMPED ON HIS HORSE WITH A CHIRRUP AND GALLOPED AWAY OUT OF THE WOODS TOWARD HIS VILLAGE
IN FACT IT WAS SO FULL OF CHARMING THINGS THAT IT WAS HARD TO MAKE A CHOICE
YES AND SO IS THE PINK STUFF
HARWEDA HOWEVER CARED VERY LITTLE ABOUT BIRDS SO HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE SINGER
ALL THE PEOPLE SHOUTED AND THE PRINCESS CLAPPED HER HANDS
CHEER UP CHEER-U-UP BR'ER PARTRIDGE WAS BUILDING A NEW HOUSE DOWN LOW IN THE BUSHES
Y-Y-YOU BEGAN IT
THIS TIME I WILL GIVE YOU A SHEEP HE SAID
BUT IT IS NOT SO PRETTY AS YOURS WHY DON'T YOU COME OFTENER UP ON THE CLIFF SAID HE
HE CHOPPED AT THESE BUT THE AXE WAS DULLED AND WITH ALL HIS SKILL HE COULD NOT CUT THEM OFF
AND HE RAN DOWN THE ROAD AND CALLED FOR HELP
THE ELDER BROTHERS APPEARED TO BE INSPECTED WITH THEIR RICHLY ATTIRED AND SPLENDIDLY ADORNED CONSORTS
HE BROUGHT IT DOWN BUTTONED UNDER HIS COAT
SHE WENT ON HER WAY ALWAYS CRYING FOR THE RETURN OF HER BEAUTIFUL MONEY
WE DIPPED AND WE GOT THEM IN SHORT THEY CHOSE YOU SAID FRED
YOU HAVE DONE WONDERS MY LITTLE MAN SAID THE KING
WHEN I COME BACK HE ANSWERED AS HE STRUGGLED UP THE FROZEN ROAD
TEENCHY DUCK CONTINUED TO CRY
THIS IS INDEED HORRIBLE
HE LEANED ON A STICK
AT LAST HE STRUGGLED UP THE BANK AND SET DOWN THE CHILD
HE HAD MIGHTY ARMS AND LEGS AND COULD CARRY TONS UPON HIS BACK
WHEN THEY REACHED MOLLY'S GATE JULIA HANDED OVER THE VASE
THERE WERE TWO DOORS TO THIS ROOM
COE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LOVED NOT ONLY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT ANIMALS AS WELL
WHEN KIT WAS SAFELY ON THE PIER KAT THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK THOUGH THE WATER WAS RUNNING DOWN IN STREAMS FROM HIS HAIR AND EYES AND EARS
SO THEY GAVE HIM A LITTLE BOTTLE
THEN WEE-WUN TOOK THE BLUE BLOW-AWAY SEEDS AND CAST THEM OVER THE WALL INTO THE STIR-ABOUT WIFE'S GARDEN
PALE AND WEAK HE LAY ON THE GROUND
A GAY SHIP WAS ABOUT TO SET SAIL
THE STORY-TELLER'S SERIES THE BOOK OF STORIES BOOKS FOR STORY-TELLERS HOW TO TELL STORIES TO CHILDREN AND SOME STORIES TO TELL
THE QUEST IS INDEFINITELY POSTPONED WITH THE RESULT THAT THE STORIES ARE EITHER CROWDED OUT ALTOGETHER OR THAT THE TEACHER REPEATS THE FEW TALES SHE HAS AT HAND MONTH AFTER MONTH AND YEAR AFTER YEAR UNTIL ALL FRESHNESS AND INSPIRATION ARE GONE FROM THE STORY TIME
I AM GOING TO TAKE THAT PACKAGE THAT LOOKS AS IF IT MIGHT BE A DOLL SHE TOOK OUT THE ENTICING-LOOKING PACKAGE AND BEGAN TO UNTIE THE STRING AND PRESENTLY DREW FORTH A PINK-AND-WHITE-AND-GREEN CHINA VASE OF A HIDEOUS SHAPE
SPOUT THE WATER SPOUTED OUT OF THE WALNUT SHELL IN A GREAT STREAM
TEENCHY DUCK WENT WADDLING DOWN THE ROAD IN THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE MISERLY PRINCE CRYING WITH ALL HER MIGHT
AND AFTER HE HAD WEPT AWHILE HE WENT CLOSE TO THE FEARFUL PLANT AND WALKED ROUND IT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN
HE LIVES IN A CLOUD-CAVE
HANS'S UNCLE NEVER TIRED OF TELLING HOW PRINCE SAVED HANS
THEN THE GIRL LAUGHED STILL MORE AND GOT UP QUICKLY ON HER KNEES
TWELFTH IMPRESSION
ONE CARD WAS FULL OF KITCHEN THINGS AND ANOTHER WAS DEVOTED TO PARLOUR FURNITURE WHILE A THIRD DISPLAYED A BEDROOM SET
SUDDENLY THERE CAME SOMETHING WET CLOSE UP TO HIS EAR AND HE STARTED UP
AS SOON AS EVER SHE HAD HAD ONE SHE WOULD GET UP ON A LOW BRANCH AND SCREECH CATCH IT
HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WOODS
BUT THE SNOWFLAKES POWDERED HIS HAIR TILL HE LOOKED AS IF HE WORE A WHITE ONE
AND ALL THE LITTLE DWARFS CAME RUNNING TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WHO HAS LOST HIS BEAUTIFUL MONEY
NO SAID HANS
THE TABLE WAS COVERED WITH GREAT BOOKS AND MANY PAPERS
AND WITH THE LAST PULL THE TOP OF THE APPLE-PIE CAME OFF STICKING TO THE KNIFE AND FORK AND WRY-FACE SAW THAT WITHIN THE PIE THERE WAS NOT ONE PIECE OF APPLE BUT--A BIG BROWN POTATO
AND THE GUARDS HURRIED HIM ALSO TO JAIL
FOR IN THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD SOWN THE BLUE SEED HAD SPRUNG UP A HUGE PLANT WHICH COVERED OVER THE WINDOW OF WEE-WUN'S FINE HOUSE AND REACHED FAR ABOVE ITS ROOF
THERE STOOD A LONG TABLE COVERED WITH DELICIOUS THINGS TO EAT
THEN THE OLD WOMAN GATHERED UP THE CAKES LARGE AND SMALL AND PUT THEM ON A PLATE
TIS HARD TO GET THITHER AND IT IS NOT EASY TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH KOSHCHEI
DEY WANTS KETCHIN'--DAT WHAT DEY WANTS
DEAR LORD HOW PLEASANT IS LIFE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NEITHER TOIL NOR STRIFE SAY THE BIRDS AND SHE TOLD HIM WHAT THEY ALL SAID DOWN TO THE ANT WHO CRAWLED IN THE MOSS AND THE WORM WHO WORKED IN THE BARK
IN THE EVENING WHEN THE DWARFS CAME HOME THEY FOUND A BRIGHT FIRE AND A WARM SUPPER WAITING FOR THEM
ALL DAY LONG HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND WHEN IN THE AFTERNOON THE LITTLE WHITE SNOWFLAKES CAME FLYING DOWN HE WATCHED FOR THE RETURN OF HIS SOLDIER COUSIN AND THE DOG WITH ANXIOUS EYES
BUT SHE FOUND HER VOICE TO SAY

A DIP EACH ARTICLE FULLY WORTH DOUBLE JULIA PUSHED UP THE COVER OF THE BASKET AND SHE AND MOLLY PEEPED IN OVER THE TOP
AND HE TOOK THE PICKAXE AND PUT IT INTO HIS OTHER POCKET
HIS COURTIERS TOO LOOKED AND LOOKED AND SAW NO MORE THAN THE OTHERS
SEEK FOR ME BEYOND LANDS THRICE-NINE IN THE EMPIRE OF THRICE-TEN AT THE HOUSE OF KOSHCHEI."[19 THEN SHE TURNED INTO A WHITE SWAN AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW
HIS HOME IS ON MOUNT OLYMPUS
THAT GREY GOOSE STEERS HIGH HER COURSE
HE WAS GOOD TO ME WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE HURT ME
NESBIT BAIN 124 THE NECKLACE OF TRUTH JEAN MACE 131 ANDERS NEW CAP ANNA WOHLENBERG 136 DUST UNDER THE RUG MAUD LINDSAY 142 A NIGHT WITH SANTA CLAUS ANNIE R
A SWEDISH FAIRY TALE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WALKED ABOUT SQUINTING AT HIM AND THEIR FACES GREW LONG WITH ENVY
KIT AND KAT CARRIED THE BASKET OF WORMS BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR RODS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND THEY WERE ALL THREE VERY HAPPY
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW CRIED HE WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY FINE APPLE-PIE BUT THE BROWN POTATO REPLIED AS COOL AS COOL I AM ONE OF THE POTATOES BELONGING TO ONE-EYE THE POTATO-WIFE AND I TURNED THE APPLES OUT THAT I MIGHT HIDE HERE A WHILE
THEY WERE ALL STARTING FOR THE WONDERFUL NEW LAND ACROSS THE SEA
WHEN WEE-WUN LOOKED AT HIS BLUE SMOCK AND HIS FEATHER CAP HE SAW THAT THE HOP-ABOUT MAN LOOKED JUST LIKE A BLUE BLOW-AWAY GROWING IN THE CHAIR AT WEE-WUN'S FIRESIDE
THE FISHERMAN BEHELD HIM WITH SURPRISE WHEN HE DREW NEAR AND JUMPING FROM HIS SEAT POKED HIS SLEEK SIDES WITH HIS WHIP
THIS CRIED WRY-FACE IS WHY I HAVE NOT SLEPT THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH AND HE WEPT LIKE ANYTHING
SHE HAD PLENTY OF WOOD TO BURN IN WINTER AND PLENTY OF MEAL TO BAKE INTO BREAD ALL THE YEAR ROUND
OUR BEARDS HAVE NOT GROWN QUICKLY YOUNG MAN
WHY BROTHER
WILLETT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HAS SAID
THE POOR PUDDLE DUCK WAS SO ASTONISHED AT THIS THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY STAND ON HER FEET
I WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD
I KNOW WHAT I AM ABOUT WHAT WAS THE POOR MAN TO DO
THOU CALL'ST ME A GOOD YOUTH BUT THOU SHOULDST FIRST FEED AND GIVE ME DRINK AND PREPARE ME A BATH THEN ONLY SHOULDST THOU ASK ME QUESTIONS THE BABA-YAGA FED HIM AND GAVE HIM TO DRINK AND MADE READY A BATH FOR HIM AND THE TSAREVICH TOLD HER HE WAS SEEKING HIS WIFE VASILISA
AND MINNIE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE DUST UNTIL SHE WENT TO BED AND THE STARS PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOW
HE LOOKED AT THE GIANT WITH EYES FULL OF TRUST AND LOVE OFFERO TOSSED HIM ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNED TO THE RIVER
SHE ROSE WENT OVER TO OEYVIND PUT ONE OF HER MUDDY HANDS INTO HIS AND TURNING HER FACE AWAY SAID
THE NEXT DAY AS HE WAS CAREFULLY CLEANING THE BIRD'S CAGE SO THAT HIS LITTLE FRIEND MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE THE WALLS AGAIN CREAKED AND GROANED AND THE MIRRORS GREW NARROWER BY JUST SO MANY INCHES AS THE WINDOWS WIDENED
BUT SHE NEVER FORGOT THEIR LESSON TO DO HER WORK FAITHFULLY
THERE WERE STRANGE FACES EVERYWHERE
AND ANDERS COULD HAVE HAD A STILL FINER CAP
THEY SHALL FLEE FROM YOUR FACE TO THE COOL HILLS AND EVEN TO FARAWAY LANDS WHERE THE TREES AND GRASS ARE NOT PARCHED AND SHRIVELLED BY YOUR FIERY BREATH AND THAT IS WHY THE WIND IN THE HOT WEATHER IS SO DISAGREEABLE
HOW EAGERLY THE MEN BELOW SEIZED UPON IT
ITS NOTES WERE VERY SWEET
HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE DRYAD
OUT OF THE HARE FLEW A DUCK AND ROSE HIGH HIGH IN THE AIR BUT THE OTHER DUCK DASHED AFTER HER AND STRUCK HER DOWN WHEREUPON THE DUCK LAID AN EGG AND THE EGG FELL INTO THE SEA
THEY RAN TO THE END OF THE PIER AND LOOKED
WAKE UP
AND HE TOOK THE WALNUT SHELL AND PUT IT INTO HIS CAP
ALL HIS LIFE HE LONGED TO SEE THE DRYAD WHOM HE HAD LOST FOR EVER
THEY THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THEMSELVES AND THE GOOD FOOD BEFORE THEM
THE RULER OF THE COUNTRY NAMED DIONYSIUS WAS A CRUEL MAN
AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN MEANING TO STAY ALL NIGHT
AND THE BEAR SAID TO HIM
OR HAST THOU HEARD CRUEL UNFRIENDLY WORDS FROM THY FATHER THE TSAR HAVE I NOT CAUSE TO GRIEVE
THERE ON THE SHORE STOOD A TENDER FAIR LITTLE BOY WITH GOLDEN HAIR
ANNAN NOT VERY LONG AGO AND NOT FAR FROM HERE LIVED A LITTLE BOY NAMED ROBBY MORGAN
THIS IS WHAT HE READ
THEN GIVE ME OF YOUR STRAW AND TAR THAT I MAY PATCH UP MY RAGGED FUR AGAIN TAKE SOME SAID THE OX AND THE BEAR FELL UPON HIM AND BEGAN TO TEAR AWAY AT THE TAR
I HAVE LOST IT CRIED THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS AND THEN HE SEIZED THE PURSE FULL OF MONEY THAT TEENCHY DUCK HELD IN HER BILL AND WENT ON HIS WAY
LI'L HANNIBAL SAT DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND HE TOOK OFF HIS STRAW HAT TO FAN HIMSELF FOR HE FELT QUITE WARM AND HE SAID
AFTER SUPPER WAS OVER THE BOY FELL SOUND ASLEEP
AND YOU MR WOLF STEAL HIS FAT-POT
OF COURSE HE KNEW HIM FOR HE KNOWS EVERY BOY AND GIRL IN CHRISTENDOM
THE SMELL OF THESE HOT CAKES WILL BRING EVERY BEGGAR WITHIN MILES TO MY HOUSE THEN SHE LOOKED A SECOND TIME AT THE MAN AND SAW THAT HE WAS NO BEGGAR
THE KING WAS JEALOUS
SOON THEY HEARD A DULL SOUND HIGH UP ON THE TOP OF A CLIFF
HE DID NOT OFTEN HAVE A HOLIDAY BECAUSE HE CARRIED MILK TO THE DOORS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN EVERY MORNING EARLY
HE RAN AND PROPPED ITS MOSSY TRUNK WITH GREAT BRANCHES THAT HE TOOK FROM THE GROUND
IT WAS SO TALL THAT NO LADDER COULD REACH ITS TOP SO THE MEN WENT UP AND DOWN ON A ROPE
HIT'S FOX-BLOOD BRER WOLF LOOKED STONISH HE LOW HOW YOU KNOW BRER RABBIT SAY I KNOWS WHAT I KNOWS BRER WOLF SAY GIMME SOME MO BRER RABBIT SAY YOU KIN GIT SOME MO FER YO'SE'F EASY NUFF EN DE FRESHER TIS DE BETTER BRER WOLF LOW HOW YOU KNOW BRER RABBIT SAY I KNOWS WHAT I KNOWS WID DAT BRER WOLF STEPPED OUT EN START TO'RDS BRER FOX
TWILL BE A FINE THING TO SHOW--A SILVER CHAIN THAT A PRINCE GAVE YOU HANS WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WANTED A CHAIN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT HIS AUNT WAS VERY SURE ABOUT IT
I DON'T WANT THE POT OF GOLD SAID GAVIN
HOW DO
TRAVELLERS WERE GLAD TO BE HELPED ON THEIR WAY BY THIS ROUGH YET KINDLY GIANT
THE REINDEER BEFORE THE SLEDGE WERE IN A HURRY TO BE OFF AND TINKLED THEIR SILVER BELLS RIGHT MERRILY
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT OF YOUR MOTHER IN THE MIDST OF YOUR HAPPINESS RECEIVE MY BLESSING
YOU RHOECUS HAVE JUST SAVED MY LIFE
AND THE SKY TALKED TO THE CLOUDS THE CLOUDS TO THE TREES THE TREES TO THE GRASS THE GRASS TO THE FLIES THE FLIES TO THE ANIMALS THE ANIMALS TO THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN TO THE GROWN-UP PEOPLE
GRANDPAPA IS AFRAID I SHALL FALL OVER BUT IT IS NOT SO VERY HIGH GRANDPAPA WON'T LET ME FOR ALL THAT MOTHER KNOWS SO MANY SONGS SAID HE
HIS DEATH DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF A NEEDLE
WHY IS THIS
HE TOOK OFF THE COARSE YARN STOCKING THAT SHE HAD KNITTED FOR HIM CUT OFF THE TOE AND BEGAN TO UNRAVEL THE YARN
HE SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS AGAIN
FOR THIS IS DONE EVERY YEAR TO REMIND PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE WIDOW AND FATHERLESS SHE SAID
HE HOPED THAT THIS SON WOULD GROW UP TO BE A WARRIOR GREATER THAN HIS FATHER
I WISH YOU WERE MY SISTER
NOW IT WAS A SQUIRREL FRISKING ABOUT AND RUNNING UP SOME TALL TREE TRUNK SO RAPIDLY THAT PRINCE HARWEDA COULD NOT FOLLOW IT WITH HIS EYES
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE--ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE--NATHAN RUBBED HIS EYES
COE ONCE UPON A TIME THE SUN THE MOON AND THE WIND WENT TO DINE WITH THEIR UNCLE AND AUNT THE THUNDER AND THE LIGHTNING
GOO GOO HE SAID
GOO GOO HE SAID
BEFORE LONG THE DWARFS CAME HOME
THE CHIEF RECEIVED THE PRISONER IN HIS WIGWAM AND TALKED WITH HIM ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS
PERHAPS HE'LL BE CURED AND PERHAPS HE WON'T
I ONLY WISH TO MAKE HER A PRESENT HE OPENED A DRAWER AND TOOK FROM IT A MAGNIFICENT AMETHYST NECKLACE
AND AFTER THAT THEY CAUGHT PUSSY SWIFT-FOOT[13 LIKEWISE
SHE CARRIES GOLD AND WILL BRING BACK PEARLS AND RICE HOW MUCH YOU KNOW CHRIF SAID RHODA
THE TSAR AND HIS GUESTS WERE ASTONISHED
WHEN HE WAS A LONG WAY FROM TOWN LI'L HANNIBAL MET A POSSUM LOPING ALONG BY THE EDGE OF THE ROAD AND THE POSSUM STOPPED AND LOOKED AT LI'L HANNIBAL
HANS ALWAYS LET HIM GO WILLINGLY WITH HIS GOOD UNCLE
HE PUT PYTHIAS IN PRISON AND FIXED A DAY FOR HIS DEATH
WILL YOU GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR CAKES SAID THE MAN
BRER FOX SEED IM COMIN EN HE SORTER BACK OFF
I'LL SIT DOWN AND REST SAID HANS TO HIMSELF AND THEN I CAN GO FASTER BUT WHEN HE SAT DOWN HE COULD NOT KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND BEFORE MANY MINUTES HE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND LAY IN A LITTLE DARK HEAP ON THE WHITE SNOW
OUT OF THE BARE PALM-STAFF SPRANG LEAVES AND DATES
SO HE THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL I WILL CARRY THE PEARLS TO HEIGH-HEAVY FOR THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT AND AWAY HE WENT WITH THE SACK UPON HIS BACK
MY FATHER AND SOVEREIGN LORD COMMANDS THEE TO WEAVE HIM A SILK CARPET IN A SINGLE NIGHT FRET NOT TSAREVICH
WE ARE GOING TO THE CITY AND YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING BETTER THERE THAN TO BE MADE INTO SOUP
IT IS A HORRID THING SAID JULIA
ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS WAS LAME AND COULD NOT RUN ABOUT THE HOUSE
DE LITTLE RABS DEY FRISK EN DEY FROLIC
AT LAST THEY DETERMINED TO SEND FOR HIS FAIRY GODMOTHER TO SEE IF SHE COULD CURE PRINCE HARWEDA OF ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF
IT WAS A DELICIOUS KIND OF SWEETMEAT THE LIKE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER TASTED BEFORE
IT WILL TAKE SOMEONE STRONGER THAN YOU ANSWERED PETER
WHY THOU MIGHTEST HAVE BROUGHT HER WITH THEE IN A KITCHEN CLOUT
SHE HAD A LITTLE HOUSE IN THE WOODS AND SOLD BROOMS FOR A LIVING
NEITHER DID THE WORM
WHAT FUN IT WOULD BE TO CUT THEM OUT JULIA LOOK AT THE PARLOUR SET SAID JULIA
I AM THE SPIRIT OF THIS TREE SHE SAID
HE WORKED HARD BUT IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO EARN BREAD FOR HIS FAMILY
SHE KNEW NOW THAT IT WAS TOO LATE THAT SHE WANTED THE PAPER DOLL FURNITURE MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD
HE HAD NO IDEA OF VANISHING TILL HIS NIGHT'S WORK WAS DONE
AND IN THE WINTER HANS WOULD PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HIS FRIEND'S SHAGGY NECK AND SLEEP CLOSE BESIDE HIM TO KEEP WARM
THEN THE FOX FASTENED HER TEETH IN HIM AND COULDN'T DRAW THEM OUT AGAIN
ROB WAS FAST ASLEEP
WHEN LINCOLN SET HIM DOWN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RIVER THE LITTLE DOG SHOWED HIS GLADNESS BY LEAPING UPON EVERYONE AND BARKING WILDLY
THE WATER IN WHICH HIS HANDS AND FACE WERE WASHED WAS ALWAYS STEEPED IN ROSE LEAVES BEFORE BEING BROUGHT TO THE NURSERY
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME BUT SURELY YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE CAPS WITH ME SAID THE KING AND RAISED HIS LARGE HEAVY GOLD CROWN FROM HIS HEAD
PROMISE TO SERVE ME FOR EVER MY GOOD FELLOW HE SAID
IT IS STRANGE CERTAINLY BUT NO ONE MUST BE ALLOWED TO NOTICE IT AND HE TOO PRAISED THE CLOTH AND PRETENDED DELIGHT AT THE BEAUTIFUL COLOURS AND THE SPLENDID TEXTURE
SHE SCOLDED AND SCOLDED AS SHE MADE HER WAY BACK TO THE DOORSTEP
HE COULD LOOK ACROSS A CORNFIELD TO HIS HOME
YOU WOULD THINK HE'D NEVER HEARD AN AXE BEFORE WELL WONDER OR NO WONDER SAID JACK I MEAN TO GO UP AND SEE WHO IS CHOPPING WOOD GO THEN SAID PAUL
WRY-FACE FETCHED HIS LITTLE LAMP WHICH IS NAMED BRIGHT-BEAUTY AND WHICH ALWAYS BURNS WITHOUT FLICKERING
THIS IS DELICIOUS SAID PRINCE HARWEDA
LOUDER AND LOUDER CAME THE TANTARATARA
A FEW DAYS LATER A SERVANT CAME FROM THE PRINCE AND TOOK HANS TO THE PALACE
I SUPPOSE THOU DIDST SEARCH THROUGH ALL THE SWAMPS FAIRLY SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT RUMBLING AND KNOCKING THE WHOLE PALACE SHOOK
ONE DAY THE HUNTER BECAME ILL AND HIS SON HAD ALL THE WORK TO DO
ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY ASLEEP HE WAS AWAKENED BY A VOICE SUCH A GENTLE PLEADING LITTLE VOICE--"DEAR GOOD KIND OFFERO CARRY ME ACROSS HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET CAUGHT UP HIS STAFF AND CROSSED TO THE FARTHER SHORE
OH CRIED MINNIE IN GREAT SURPRISE
DEAR MOLLY,--I MISS YOU VERY MUCH
HE FELT SO SORRY THAT HE PROMISED HIMSELF NEVER AGAIN TO DO ANYTHING WRONG NEVER TO CUT THE THREAD ON THE SPINNING WHEEL NOR LET THE GOATS OUT NOR GO DOWN TO THE SEA ALONE
THEY SHALL STAND UPON MY MANTEL SHELF AND EVERY MORNING I SHALL SAY GOOD-MORNING LITTLE BLUE SHOES AND EVERY NIGHT I SHALL SAY GOOD-NIGHT AND WE SHALL ALL BE AS HAPPY AS CAN BE SO HE WENT TO PUT THE LITTLE SHOES INTO HIS POCKETS BUT HE FOUND THEY WERE ALREADY FULL OF BLUE BLOW-AWAY SEEDS
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RUN AWAY WITH US
AS SOON AS THEY LOOK UP I CAN ASK THEM IF I MAY CHOP DOWN A TREE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
MOLLY'S EYES WERE FASCINATED BY A CARD FULL OF PAPER-DOLL PATTERNS AND THEIR PRETTY BLUE RED AND WHITE DRESSES
I'M GWINE TER FIN WHO'S IN DAT HOUSE EN I AIN'T GWINE IN DAR NUDDER
AIN'T YOU GWINE TER HEYO
HOW CAN I BE HAPPY WHEN I AM IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE SAID THE CAT
AT LAST RHOECUS IN ANGER STRUCK THE LITTLE CREATURE AND WOUNDED IT
THEN SHE GAVE THEM EACH A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK FOR THEIR BREAKFAST
GRANDFATHER AND THE TWINS STARTED OFF TOGETHER DOWN THE LONG ROAD BESIDE THE CANAL
TRIMMED WITH TAR ARE YOU
OH SHE SAID HE HAS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARILY FINE CAP ON HIS HEAD THAT THAT WILL DO JUST AS WELL AS A UNIFORM AND SHE TOOK ANDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
JACK TOOK THE PICKAXE FROM HIS OTHER POCKET
NOW SEE WHAT A SKILFUL MAN CAN DO HE TOOK THE AXE AND WALKED CAREFULLY ROUND THE TREE
I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT THEN HER COURAGE WAS ALL GONE
INDEED HE WAS MUCH PLEASED AND HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET THERE THAT HE WALKED FASTER THAN HIS MOTHER UP OVER THE HILLS

TOMMY LAY SLEEPING IN HIS LITTLE BED AND DREAMING OF A MERRY CHRISTMAS
HOW DARE THEY COMPLAIN NOT SO GREAT QUEEN REPLIED THE KING

WE WILL SEE IN THE MORNING WHAT SHE WILL SAY THE SERVANTS OBEYED AND TEENCHY DUCK IMMEDIATELY CRIED

HANS NAMED HIM PRINCE FOR AFTER ALL THE DOG WAS THE PRINCE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT
WATER WATER FREEZE FREEZE WHAT ARE YOU SAYING INQUIRED THE WOLF WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD
HE SAW THE OLD RED HOUSE THE GRANDMOTHER AT THE WINDOW AND RHODA IN THE GARDEN
NEVER IN ALL HIS LIFE HAD HE GIVEN UP ONE OF HIS COMFORTS THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE A PLEASURE
HE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD RATHER HAVE BOUGHT A COW WITH THE GOLD-PIECE THAN A SILVER CHAIN
HE WALKED A LONG WAY AND AT LAST SAW ONE GROWING AT THE MOUTH OF A CAVE
FOOTNOTE 20
WHEN IT WAS EVENING-TIME HE STOLE OUT AND LAID IT BY WRY-FACE'S DOOR
FOOTNOTE 21
HE WILL DIE THE WORKMEN WERE SO ALARMED THAT THEY COULD THINK OF NO WAY TO HELP THEIR COMRADE
THEN IF THOU CHOOSEST ME OPEN THEM AGAIN CHRIF CLOSED HIS EYES
SHE SPAT AT HIM AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE
THEN TURPIE WENT SNIFFING AND SNUFFING ALONG TO FIND THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AND SOON CAME TO THE HOBYAHS HOUSE
FOOTNOTE 7

SUDDENLY THE ROOM BECAME DARK AS DARK
HE TRIED IN VAIN TO FIND A QUIET CORNER TILL HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME WINDING STAIRS THAT LED UP TO THE NEXT STOREY
AH THAT IS MY BREAKFAST I SEE AND HE ATE IT UP IN A TWINK

CLOSE ON HIS HEELS CAME THE FOX DRIVING BEFORE HIM GEESE AND HENS AND ALL MANNER OF FOWLS
THE DONKEY AND THE DOG LAY DOWN UNDER A LARGE TREE THE CAT STRETCHED HERSELF OUT ON ONE OF THE BRANCHES AND THE ROOSTER FLEW TO THE TOP WHERE HE FELT QUITE SAFE
MOREOVER IF YOU WAIT WHILE THE PROCESSION PASSES YOU WILL SEE TWO CHILDREN DRESSED TO REPRESENT HAN CHUNG AND HO-SEEN-KO AND THEIR MOTHER CARRYING THE EMPTY RICE BOWL BETWEEN THEM
WRY-FACE HAD GONE ROUND TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURS TO TELL THEM THE GRAND JOKE ABOUT ONE-EYE THE POTATO-WIFE
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU SAID KIT CROSSLY
THE FOX WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND HIM STILL SITTING THERE AS HE PASSED BY AND LOOKING AT THE SKY ABOVE HIM MURMURED
AND SOMETIMES WHEN HIS VISITORS WERE STUPID AND STAYED A LONG TIME OR WHEN THEY ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS OR WHEN THEY MADE HIM PRESENTS WHICH HE DID NOT LIKE AILBE LONGED TO BE BACK IN THE FOREST WITH THE GOOD BEASTS
WHY TO AN IMAGE OF SANTA CLAUS THE SIZE OF LIFE HOLDING A CHRISTMAS TREE HUNG WITH WONDERFUL FRUIT
BRIMLEY JOHNSON

WHAT IF I WERE TO HIDE THERE AND WAIT FOR HIM AS I SAID HE WAS A BRAVE LITTLE CHAP AND HE WALKED STRAIGHT INTO THE SHOP WITH THE STREAM OF BIG PEOPLE
PRINCE HARWEDA WAS FILLED WITH JOY

MANY A STRUGGLE HE HAD WITH THE OLD HABIT OF SELFISHNESS BUT AS TIME PASSED BY HE GREW TO BE A GREAT WISE KING LOVING AND TENDERLY CARING FOR ALL HIS PEOPLE AND LOVED BY THEM IN RETURN
I WOULD GIVE ALL I HAVE FOR ONE SUCH FRIEND
AND IF YOU FAITHFUL PROVE AND GOOD WE WILL REWARD YOU AS WE SHOULD NOW MINNIE WAS MUCH PLEASED FOR SHE LIKED THE KIND DWARFS AND WANTED TO HELP THEM SO SHE THANKED THEM AND WENT TO BED TO DREAM HAPPY DREAMS

NOW THERE WAS TO BE A STATE PROCESSION THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE MORNING OF THE DAY ON WHICH THIS WAS TO TAKE PLACE THE IMPOSTORS WERE WORKING BY THE LIGHT OF MANY CANDLES
AND WHEN MINNIE SAW THIS SHE KNEW THAT THEY MUST BE THE DWARFS WHO KEPT THE GOLD IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN
THEY SHOUTED FOR JOY
LIE DOWN AND REST
IT WAS AS BLUE AS THE LITTLE BLUE SHOES AND WEE-WUN HAD NEVER SEEN ANY SEED LIKE IT BEFORE
COME HERE SOMETHING IS WRONG SAID THE PEOPLE
AND LET ME TELL YOU MY LITTLE GNOME UNLESS YOU TAKE ME TO HER IMMEDIATELY I SHALL CLIMB INTO YOUR MATTRESS AGAIN
YOU COULD DIP AND I COULD DIP AND I COULD GIVE YOU WHAT I GET SHE WAS LONGING TO KNOW THE CONTENTS OF A CERTAIN INTERESTING IRREGULAR PARCEL
JACK WAS QUICK AND BRIGHT AND SO LITTLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN HIMSELF IN ONE OF PETER'S BIG BOOTS
BUT AT LAST WEE-WUN SET THE DOOR ON ITS HINGES AND PUT THE WOOD IN THE WOOD CELLAR AND WASHED THE HOP-ABOUT MAN'S PLATTER AND SPOON AND SET STRAIGHT ALL THE CHAIRS AND TABLES AND PUT THE SPADE IN THE PLACE WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE AND HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE COULD HARDLY MOVE ANOTHER STEP
BUT THE TIDE WAS GOING OUT AND CARRYING HER SHOE FARTHER AWAY EVERY MINUTE
THEN HE COUNTED AGAIN
WHERE DID IT COME FROM
OUR HELPER IS A STRANGER CHILD NOW WHEN MINNIE SAW THE DWARFS SHE CAME TO MEET THEM

THAT WAS WHEN GRANDPA CAME THERE AND ANYTHING LIKE IT HE HAD NEVER EATEN BEFORE OR SINCE
THEY WERE ALL SO TIRED AFTER THEIR LONG JOURNEY THAT THEY WERE SOON FAST ASLEEP
ONCE THE HARPER SANG A SONG IN WHICH THE NAME OF SATAN WAS HEARD
HE GREW SO WISE AND GREAT THAT HE WAS MADE A BISHOP AND HAD A PALACE OF HIS OWN IN THE TOWN OF EMLY
AT LAST HE FOUND A WOMAN A VERY VERY OLD WOMAN WHO TOLD HIM THAT WHEN SHE WAS A TINY GIRL SHE REMEMBERED HER GRANDMOTHER SAYING HOW WHEN SHE WAS A TINY GIRL A POOR YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN SPIRITED AWAY BY THE GENII OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE DAY OF THE FEAST OF LANTERNS LEAVING HIS WIFE AND LITTLE CHILDREN WITH ONLY A FEW HANDFULS OF RICE IN THE HOUSE

SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT THE TINKLING MUSIC OF THE FOUNTAIN HAD CEASED
DANCE WITH ME SHE SAID AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE POT OF GOLD AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO CHRIF
THEN THE APPLE-PIE WAS FINISHED AND IN THE OVEN
ANDERS DID NOT ANSWER
HANS LIVED WITH HIS AUNT AND HIS UNCLE IN A VILLAGE UP AMONG THESE MOUNTAINS

THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF PYTHIAS LIVED FAR AWAY
NO ONE ONE DAY HE WALKED THROUGH THE VILLAGE
THEN KAT TOOK OFF HER OTHER ONE AND HER STOCKINGS AND THEY ALL THREE WENT BACK TO THE BEACH
I'M A THREE-YEAR-OLD HEIFER STUFFED WITH STRAW AND DAUBED WITH TAR THEN GIVE ME SOME OF YOUR TAR TO SMEAR MY SIDES WITH WHEN THOSE DOGS AND SONS OF DOGS TEAR MY HIDE TAKE SOME SAID THE OX

A BLACK PIPE INSTEAD OF A CHIMNEY WAS STICKING THROUGH THE ROOF
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND EVERYTHING IN A BUSTLE FOR THE PLACE WAS FULL OF FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO HAD COME WITH THE PRINCE AND THE SERVANTS WERE HURRYING HERE AND THERE TO WAIT ON THEM

PO LI'L HANNIBAL SAID BR'ER RABBIT AS HE POURED THE SOUP
A DEAD SILENCE WAS IN THE ROOM
OH YES I CAN EAT JUST AS WELL SAID ANDERS AND HELD ON TO HIS CAP FOR IF THEY SHOULD TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM NOBODY WOULD ANY LONGER BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A PRINCE AND BESIDES HE DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT HE WOULD GET IT BACK AGAIN
THE COMPILER WISHES ESPECIALLY TO EXPRESS HER APPRECIATION FOR MANY HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS AS TO MATERIAL RECEIVED FROM MRS MARY W
THE PURPLE AND SCARLET COVERINGS OF THEIR FOLLOWERS GLITTERED WITH SILVER AND GOLD
SHE OPENED IT EAGERLY AND TOOK OUT A BLOCK OF BLACK PAPER TO BE USED AS A SLATE AND A PENCIL WITH WHICH TO WRITE ON IT
WELL I DO DECLARE CRIED WRY-FACE
LI'L HANNIBAL
WHEN HE AWOKE HE FOUND IT WAS NO DREAM FOR HE HELD A GOLDEN BRIDLE
HE'LL BE HERE HE SAID PATTING HANS ON THE HEAD BY MILKING-TIME I WARRANT
THEN HE WOULD SEND THE BOATS DOWN THE LITTLE STREAM THAT FLOWED PAST THE OLD RED HOUSE
HOURS WERE SPENT EACH DAY FIRST BEFORE ONE MIRROR AND THEN ANOTHER AND HE DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE WINDOWS WERE GROWING NARROWER AND NARROWER AND THE MIRRORS WIDER UNTIL THE FORMER HAD BECOME SO SMALL THAT THEY HARDLY ADMITTED LIGHT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN THE LOOKING-GLASS
HE JUMPED INTO THE MUDDY DITCH LIFTED UP THE HELPLESS PIG AND PLACED HIM AGAIN ON SOLID GROUND
I'LL STICK TIGHT WHEN YOU SLIDE DOWN THE CHIMNEY YES NO DOUBT YOU WILL STICK TIGHT--IN THE CHIMNEY MY LITTLE MAN I MEAN TO YOUR BACK SAID ROB WITH A QUIVER IN HIS VOICE
KAT SQUEALED AND JERKED HER ROD
DO NOT DARE TO TAKE IT OFF FOR A SINGLE MOMENT
AT LAST THE OLD WOMAN HAD A GOOD IDEA
I MUST LOOK ROUND A LITTLE MORE BEFORE I DECIDE SHE ADDED PRUDENTLY
CHRIF COULD SEE IT NOWHERE
SO AFTER FOLLOWING THEM FOR MILES THE FIVE WOLVES GRADUALLY DROPPED FARTHER AND FARTHER BEHIND
BY THIS TIME THE WINDOWS WERE A FOOT WIDE OR MORE
BUT FATHER SAID THE PRINCESS HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE OTHER PART OF THE PRIZE AND SHE BLUSHED VERY RED
WHEN HE SAW WEE-WUN COME ALONG WITH TEARS STILL ON HIS CHEEKS AND SHAKING IN HIS SHOES HE SAID
IF YE GET TO THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW AND THEN DIG AND DIG YE'LL COME TO A POT OF GOLD RHODA
THE DAY KIT AND KAT WENT FISHING LUCY FITCH PERKINS THIS IS A STORY OF KIT AND KAT TWINS WHO LIVED IN HOLLAND
SHE WAITED UNTIL THE BEAR WENT AWAY

I AM THE ROBIN A LITTLE BROTHER TO MAN
OUR LORD SAT THERE WITH A GREAT BEARD AS IN THE CATECHISM AND THE GOAT STOOD EATING THE LEAVES OFF A SHINING TREE
THEY LOOKED UP AND SAW ON THE TOP OF THE LODGE AN UNKNOWN BIRD
THAT WAS WHY MERLIN GAVE ME THE NECKLACE
HIS AUNT HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO THEM BUT HANS SAID NOTHING AT ALL
BUT AS HE SPOKE THE AXE CRUMBLED TO DUST BENEATH HIS FINGERS AND THE SECOND CHESS-PLAYER LAUGHED AND POINTED TO THE LITTLE BROWN SWEETMEATS ON THE TABLE
ALL WHO THOUGHT THEMSELVES GOOD-LOOKING STOOD IN A ROW NOT FAR FROM THE PRINCESS
WHO LOST HIS BEAUTIFUL MONEY CRIED TEENCHY DUCK
HOW MUCH IS IT SIXPENCE EVERYTHING IS SIXPENCE IN THIS SHOP SAID MOLLY IN DESPAIR
THEN HE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN SHARPENING HIS KNIFE AGAIN
THERE STOOD HIS FAIRY GODMOTHER SMILING AND WITH HER HAND REACHED OUT TOWARD HIM
ROBBY MORGAN SAID SANTA CLAUS
I CAN SEE THE LAMP IN OUR KITCHEN NOW NATHAN WAS NOW ON THE TOP OF THE HILL
RHODA SITS BY THE WINDOW WATCHING FOR CHRIF
AH WELL
COME NOW THOUGHT IVAN I WILL SLAY THIS BEAST BUT THE BEAR IMPLORED HIM
HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON THE COUCH BUT ITS SOFT PILLOWS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND A HARD IRON FRAMEWORK RECEIVED HIM
MY HUSBAND GIVE BACK TO TEENCHY DUCK THIS PURSE YOU HAVE TAKEN OR ELSE WE SHALL BE RUINED SHE SAID
THE UNCLE WAS SO BRAVE AND TRUSTY THAT HE WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY WHO CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS WANTED HIM AS GUIDE
AT LAST ONE BOLDER THAN THE REST SEIZED HER BY THE END OF THE WING AND THREW HER INTO THE RED-HOT OVEN
IS IT NOT SPLENDID SAID BOTH THE OLD STATESMEN
WHOM ELSE IS THERE FOR ME TO CONQUER
I WILL TAKE HIM HOME TO MY WIFE HE REMARKED AS HE FLUNG THE LIMP BODY INTO HIS CART
WEEKS PASSED AND EVEN MONTHS
THE LITTLE AXE CHOPPED AND CUT AND SPLIT THIS WAY AND THAT RIGHT AND LEFT UP AND DOWN
THEN GRANDFATHER STUCK THE TWINS FISH-POLES UP IN THE SAND AND TIED THE TWO LINES TOGETHER FOR A CLOTHES-LINE AND HUNG KIT'S CLOTHES UP ON IT AND KAT PUT THEIR THREE WOODEN SHOES IN A ROW BESIDE KIT
ANSWER ME SAID OFFERO OR I LEAVE YOU AT ONCE THEN SATAN SAID YES IT IS TRUE THAT I FEAR THE CROSS

HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS AND WENT OUT FOR A WALK FOR HE DID NOT BEGRUDGE ANYBODY'S SEEING HOW FINE HE WAS
A WOODPECKER FLEW OUT OF THE CHIMNEY AND AWAY TO THE WOOD

DUST UNDER THE RUG
FLAGS WERE FLYING FIDDLERS WERE PLAYING GAY TUNES ON THEIR FIDDLES AND THE DRUMMER BOY KEPT TIME ON HIS DRUM AND MADE A GREAT NOISE
THE WHITE BEAR WENT FARTHER BACK INTO HIS CAVE IN THE ICEBERG AND GROWLED TERRIBLY

NEVER BEFORE HAD THE TREES LOOKED SO TALL AND STATELY OR THE WHITE CLOUDS FLOATING THROUGH THE SKY SO LOVELY

BUT NOW IT WAS DONE IN A MOMENT AND HE WOULD NEVER SEE IT AGAIN
KREEM-KREEM-KREEM HE SQUEAKED
IMMEDIATELY THE NECKLACE LOOKED AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER
THE HEART OF THE MOTHER-WOLF WAS TOUCHED FOR SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN LITTLE ONES AT HOME AND HOW SAD IT WOULD BE TO SEE THEM SO HELPLESS AND LONELY AND FORGOTTEN

BELLEROPHON DREW NEAR
THEREFORE MR FOX SET HIS WITS TO WORK AND KEPT HIS EYES OPEN FOR WHAT MIGHT COME ALONG

HE HAD NOT EATEN NOR SLEPT
MY LITTLE MASTER HE GASPED DO NOT PASS THIS WAY AGAIN
YOU DO NOT SEEM TO BE VERY HAPPY I SHOULD THINK NOT EXCLAIMED TEENCHY DUCK
THEY MADE SUCH A NOISE THAT THE WINDOW RATTLED
ONE SHINING SPOT HE SAW IN THE DARKNESS
THEN HIS FACE CHANGED
SWITZERLAND IS A WONDERFUL COUNTRY FULL OF BEAUTIFUL SNOWY MOUNTAINS WHERE GLEAMING ICE-FIELDS SHINE AND DARK PINE FORESTS GROW
THE LAST WE HEARD OF THEM THEY WERE STILL THERE AND HAVING HAPPY TIMES TOGETHER
AT THIS THE POOR PRINCE CLASPED HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT
WHERE DID THE SIXTH COW COME FROM
HE HASTILY GROPED HIS WAY TO IT AND HE FOUND IN THE PLACE OF THE DANCING RUNNING STREAM A SILENT POOL OF WATER
AS HE WAS TURNING AWAY HE HEARD A SOFT VOICE SAY RHOECUS THERE BESIDE THE TREE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL DRYAD
YES BOYS YOU ARE RIGHT LINCOLN REPLIED
THEN THE LITTLE GIRL TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
JUST HERE STOOD A CROSS
IT WILL STRETCH SAID TEENCHY DUCK
BUT BEFORE STRIKING THE FIRST BLOW HE PEEPED INTO THE CAVE TO SEE IF IT WERE EMPTY
ONE OF THEM HALF-EATEN WAS STILL CLUTCHED IN HIS HAND
AILBE LEAVES HIS FOREST HOME NOW ONE DAY A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THIS A HUNTER CAME RIDING OVER THE MOUNTAIN ON HIS WAY HOME FROM THE CHASE AND HE HAPPENED TO PASS NEAR THE CAVE WHERE AILBE AND THE WOLVES LIVED
HIS NAME WAS OFFERO
I AM THE HOP-ABOUT MAN AND SINCE YOU HAVE LET THE GREEN OGRE CARRY AWAY THE BLUE BLOW-AWAY IN WHICH I LIVED I HAVE COME TO LIVE WITH YOU BUT MY FINE HOUSE IS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD TWO PEOPLE CRIED WEE-WUN AND HE WAS IN A WAY
SOME SAID THERE WERE OAKS IN THE FOREST THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
THUS IT HAS COME TO BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE ABILITY TO TELL A STORY WELL IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUIPMENT OF THE PARENT OR THE TEACHER OF LITTLE CHILDREN
ON IT WAS WRITTEN
STORIES TO TELL TO CHILDREN BY S
CATCH IT
AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE SHE WENT INTO HER HOUSE AND MADE ANOTHER SPELL INSTEAD
NO THE GOAT IS MINE SHE SAID AND THREW HER ARMS ROUND ITS NECK LOOSENED ONE OF HER GARTERS AND FASTENED IT ROUND
BUT HE ONLY MOVED FARTHER BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND DID NOT TAKE HIS HANDS AWAY FROM HIS HEAD
FANNY E
HE HAS STOLEN HIS COAT FROM A POLAR BEAR AND HIS CAP TOO I DECLARE
THEN A PARTY LANDED
EVERYDAY STORIES TO TELL TO CHILDREN BY MRS H
AND THE BASKET OF WORMS AND THE BASKET OF LUNCH WERE THERE TOO
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW THE ROCKS FLEW
MY CAKES SEEM VERY SMALL WHEN I EAT THEM BUT THEY ARE FAR TOO LARGE TO GIVE AWAY
IF YOU PLEASE SHE SAID I'M LITTLE MINNIE GREY
AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF IT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE FOUND
IT IS BEST AFTER ALL HE SAID
IN THE YARD HE RAN AGAINST THE DONKEY WHO GAVE HIM A SAVAGE KICK WHILE THE ROOSTER ON THE ROOF CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS HE COULD COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO THEN THE ROBBER RAN BACK TO HIS CHIEF
A LEGEND OF THE NORTH WIND MARY CATHERINE JUDD NORTH WIND LIKES A BIT OF FUN AS DEARLY AS A BOY DOES AND IT IS WITH BOYS HE LIKES BEST TO PLAY
THE HOP-ABOUT MAN_[11 AGNES GROZIER HERBERTSON WEE-WUN WAS A LITTLE GNOME WHO LIVED IN THE BYE-BYE MEADOW IN A FINE NEW HOUSE WHICH HE LOVED

THE MINISTER LOOKED AND LOOKED BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE EMPTY LOOM AND OF COURSE HE COULD SEE NOTHING
SO SHE TOLD HIM HOW ONCE EVERYTHING COULD TALK
THE TREES LOOKED BIG AND BLACK
IS IT YOURS--THIS GOAT SHE ASKED
HIS FEET WERE NUMB AND HIS FINGERS TINGLED AND THE WIND SANG IN HIS EARS TILL HE WAS AS SLEEPY AS SLEEPY COULD BE
WHERE IS THE GOAT ASKED HIS MOTHER LOOKING UP AT THE ROOF
HOW DARE ANY ONE SHUT HIM A PRINCE UP IN A DARK PRISON LIKE THIS
KAT ALMOST ALWAYS SAID WHY AND WHEN SHE DIDN'T KIT DID
I MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SO THAT HE CANNOT HARM ME
I HOPE MY BEARD WILL NEVER GROW AS QUICKLY SAID WANG CHIH AS HE ROSE AND TOOK UP HIS AXE AGAIN
IF PRISCILLA CHOSE TO SPEND HER MONEY ON FIREWORKS THAT IS HER LOOKOUT BUT NOW SHE HERSELF HAD SPENT HER MONEY FOOLISHLY
HE WENT IN DE HOUSE HE DID EN WAIT FER BRER RABBIT TER COME HOME
THEN SAID THE DONKEY WE MUST ROUSE UP AND GO ON TO THIS LIGHT FOR NO DOUBT WE SHALL FIND A GOOD STOPPING-PLACE THERE THE DOG SAID HE WOULD BE GLAD OF A LITTLE PIECE OF MEAT OR A COUPLE OF BONES IF HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE
YES YES THE DONKEY ANSWERED
THE FURNITURE IS SO SWEET SAID MOLLY AND I AM SURE I WANT IT THE PAPER DOLLS ARE SWEET TOO SAID JULIA
WRY-FACE BEGAN TO WEEP
WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE END OF THE RAINBOW HAD RESTED THE RAINBOW WAS GONE
THAT IS ENOUGH

SO POP OUT OF BED AND GET DRESSED
HE ONLY IS NOBLE AND GREAT WHO CARES FOR THE HELPLESS AND WEAK THE STORY OF PEGASUS FANNY E
DO YOU HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AS THEY RUN ABOUT SO WILDLY
THERE HAS TO BE A WALL BECAUSE THE SEA IS HIGHER THAN THE LAND
EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE WAS DONE AND NOTHING WHICH COULD ADD TO HIS EASE OR COMFORT WAS LEFT UNDONE
IT WAS SO NICE TO LIE THERE LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING HUNG WITH TOYS AND WITH THE FAINT HUM OF VOICES IN HIS EARS
AS HE WAS RIDING UNDER THE TREES HE SAW A LITTLE WHITE CREATURE RUN ACROSS THE PATH IN FRONT OF HIM
HE CAUGHT THE SHEEP BY A STRAP WHICH WAS ROUND ITS NECK AND LED IT SLOWLY UP THE STAIRS OF THE INN TO THE ROOM FROM WHICH THE TABLECLOTH HAD DISAPPEARED THE NIGHT BEFORE
AND HE FOUND A SPADE AND WENT OUT AND BEGAN TO DIG AND DIG AT THE ROOT OF THE POTATO-PLANT
HE IS COMING AT SIX O'CLOCK
THE PLATE SHE SET ON THE PANTRY SHELF AND THEN LOCKED THE DOOR
WHY DO YOU TREMBLE LORD EMPEROR ASKED THE GIANT
THE CAT WAS TO STAND ON THE DOG'S SHOULDERS AND THE ROOSTER PROMISED TO LIGHT UPON THE CAT'S HEAD
THE LUMPY MATTRESS NOW HE GOT INTO BED AND THOUGHT HE WOULD GO TO SLEEP
THE GIANT BENT UNDER HIS BURDEN
HE HAS STOPPED TO PUT THOSE ROBINS BACK INTO THEIR NEST THEY WERE RIGHT
OVERHEAD A LAMP BURNED DIMLY
WHEN CHRIF AND ANDY ENTERED THE HALL THE PRINCESS SAW THEM AT ONCE
THEN HE BREATHED TWICE AND THE WATER CAME OUT IN THREE MIGHTY RIVERS AND WANG CHIH WHO HAD TAKEN CARE TO FILL HIS BOTTLE WHEN THE FIRST STREAM BEGAN TO FLOW SAILED AWAY ON THE WHITE CRANE'S BACK AS FAST AS HE COULD TO ESCAPE BEING DROWNED
HANS THE SHEPHERD BOY ELLA LYMAN CABOT HANS WAS A LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY WHO LIVED IN GERMANY
OH I KNOW

ONE-EYE HAVE YOU GOT ALL YOUR POTATOES TOGETHER ONE-EYE STILL WEPT
ONE WOULD THINK YOU WERE GOING TO DIE ON THE JOURNEY IT IS ONLY TOO TRUE SAID TEENCHY DUCK AND THEN SHE TOLD BROTHER WOLF ABOUT FINDING THE MONEY-PURSE JUST AS SHE HAD TOLD BROTHER FOX
HERE I AM WRY-FACE HERE I AM WELL I NEVER DID CRIED WRY-FACE AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
THE COURTIERS WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BEAR THE EMPEROR'S TRAIN PUT THEIR HANDS NEAR THE FLOOR AS IF TO LIFT THE TRAIN
NURSEYS--NURSEYS
NURSEYS--NURSEYS
I CANNOT LEAVE THE SHEEP SIR HE SAID
HE STRETCHED OUT HIS TIRED LEGS AND TURNING ONE OF THE WOOLLY SHEEP ON ITS SIDE PILLOWED HIS CURLY HEAD UPON IT
WHAT A HANDSOME FAMILY WE ARE HE WOULD SAY
AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK TOO MUCH ANSWERED THE KING
WHEN HE HAD PULLED OUT A LONG PIECE HE TIED THE END AROUND A SMALL PIECE OF BRICK
HIS GRAN'DADDY HAD BEEN OUT LOOKING FOR LI'L HANNIBAL
I CAN SEE A GREAT MANY HOUSES AND PEOPLE SAID WANG CHIH AND STREETS--WHY THIS IS THE TOWN I WAS IN YESTERDAY THE ONE WHICH HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF MY OLD VILLAGE WANG CHIH STARED AND GREW MORE AND MORE PUZZLED
HOW MUCH ARE THESE CARDS SHE ASKED
OTHERS WERE SITTING AROUND THE WALLS
IN LATER YEARS SHE WENT TO ENGLAND TO SEE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOYS AND GIRLS AND THE HOMES AND SCHOOLS HE HAD TOLD HER ABOUT DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
AT LEAST SO THE CHIEF THOUGHT
LET US HURRY ON OUR WAY THE TWO BOYS FIRST WENT THROUGH A FOREST
MOLLY'S PERPLEXITIES FLETCHER'S WAS A DELIGHTFUL SHOP
WELL I CONFESS IT
THEY PRESENT THE VIRTUES OF PERSISTENCE FAITHFULNESS TRUTHFULNESS HONESTY GENEROSITY LOYALTY TO ONE'S WORD TENDER CARE OF ANIMALS AND LOVE OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY
THEN THE OLD WOMAN AWOKE AND THERE WAS NO OX TO BE SEEN
YOU AND TOM SHAW--WHY IT IS A BEAR YES IT REALLY WAS A BEAR
ONLY THE SOLDIER COUSIN WHO WAS REALLY SORRY FOR HIS CARELESSNESS TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
AND HE NEVER MISSED HIM UNTIL NOW CRIED THE FRIENDS
WELL ONE MORNING LI'L HANNIBAL WOKE UP AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SOMETHING
BUT WHEN IT WAS DONE SHE SHOOK HER HEAD FOR IT ALSO WAS TOO LARGE TO GIVE AWAY
ALL THESE THINGS SHOW THAT HE WAS A REAL GENUINE DRAGON AND IF YOU EVER MEET A DRAGON WHO IS NOT EXACTLY LIKE THIS YOU WILL KNOW HE IS ONLY A MAKE-BELIEVE ONE

AND SHE RECOGNIZED HIM TOO--HOW I CANNOT SAY FOR HE HAD CHANGED GREATLY SINCE SHE LAST SAW HIM A NAKED LITTLE SUN-BROWNED BOY
THE PEOPLE COULD SEE THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE BUSY PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
HERE HE WAS UP IN THE MOON AND YET HE COULD HAVE THROWN A STONE INTO THE BUSY STREET OF THE CHINESE TOWN BELOW HIS WINDOW
THERE WAS A NARROW PATH LEADING THROUGH THE FOREST AND SHE DETERMINED TO FOLLOW IT UNTIL SHE REACHED SOME PLACE WHERE SHE MIGHT FIND THE WORK SHE WANTED
THEIR REAL NAMES WERE CHRISTOPHER AND KATRINA BUT THEIR MOTHER VROUW VEDDER SAYS THAT THEY ARE NOT TO BE CALLED CHRISTOPHER AND KATRINA UNTIL THEY ARE FOUR AND A HALF FEET HIGH
HARRAP CO

THE OLD WOMAN STOOD BY HER FIRE BAKING CAKES FOR HER EVENING MEAL
THE MORNING IS WISER THAN THE EVENING SHE MADE THE TSAREVICH LIE DOWN AND REST THEN CASTING HER FROG-SKIN SHE TURNED INTO A MAIDEN SOUL WENT OUT UPON HER BEAUTIFUL BALCONY AND CRIED WITH A PIERCING VOICE
AND MINNIE TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL FOR A LITTLE VOICE RIGHT IN HER OWN HEART SAID

THE LAD STOPPED AND LOOKED AROUND HIM

HE CAUGHT UP THE SHIVERING LITTLE ANIMAL WHICH LICKED HIS HANDS AND FACE IN A VERY PASSION OF GRATITUDE
YOU SEE HE RECKONED HE WAS MIGHTY GLAD TO BE AT HOME AND WORKING AGAIN
AS FOR THE STRAW-STUFFED OX IT STOOD IN THE SUN TILL IT FELL TO PIECES
THEN SUDDENLY THE MUSIC GREW HARSH
WHILE THEY SAT AT SUPPER THEY TOLD HER THAT THEIR FAIRY HOUSEKEEPER HAD TAKEN A HOLIDAY AND THEIR HOUSE WAS NOT WELL KEPT BECAUSE SHE WAS AWAY
BUT ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE SHE WEARS A BLACK COAT AND A LITTLE RED CAP
FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS HANDSOME CEILING HUNG A LARGE GILDED BIRD-CAGE CONTAINING A BEAUTIFUL BIRD WHICH JUST AT THIS MOMENT WAS SINGING A GLAD SONG OF WELCOME TO THE PRINCE
POCAHONTAS OFTEN VISITED CAPTAIN SMITH AND LEARNED TO KNOW AND LOVE HIS FRIENDS
AS THE BOY WAS HUNGRY FOR HIS BREAKFAST HE OBEYED NORTH WIND'S COMMAND AND PATTED THE SHEEP UPON ITS BACK
THE PATH WAS NARROW AND CROOKED AND STEEP CLIFFS TOWERED ABOVE IT ON BOTH SIDES
G
HIS SENSE OF HEARING BEING UNUSUALLY KEEN EVEN FOR A FOX HE WAS SOON GUIDED TO THE WOLF'S RETREAT BY HIS MOURNFUL HOWLS
OCEANS OF TOYS
THE WOMAN THOUGHT TO HERSELF WHY DID I LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN
SEE THE BROWN CHAIRS AND THE DEAR LITTLE BROWN CLOCK
GOO GOO GOO AND TO THIS DAY WHEN YOU SEE A BABY CROWING AND SAYING GOO GOO REMEMBER HE IS THINKING OF THE TIME WHEN HE OVERCAME THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO HAD CONQUERED ALL THE WORLD
BUT THE BLUE BLOW-AWAY TOOK NO NOTICE OF HIS TEARS AND THE LITTLE SHOES INSIDE THE HOUSE WENT ON SINGING
WHETHER IT SWALLOWED HIM OR HE SWALLOWED IT IS STILL A PUZZLE TO ROBBY
HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND AND HOW IT TWINKLED AND SHONE
AND WHEN THE SPELL WAS READY HE LAY DOWN AND FELL ASLEEP
HOW CAN I PRAY ASKED OFFERO I KNOW NO PRAYERS THEN SAID THE GENTLE OLD MAN I THINK THE SON OF MARY WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU USE YOUR STRENGTH IN SOME GOOD WORK
HIS LITTLE FACE PUCKERED AND GREW RED
HERE IS THE STORY OF THE DAY THEY WENT FISHING
GIVE ME BACK MY BEAUTIFUL MONEY THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS WAS FURIOUS
THIS WILL BE JUST THE THING HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THAT EVENING MY HEAD WILL BE CUT OFF SO I SHALL CROW AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE AS LONG AS I CAN LISTEN RED COMB SAID THE DONKEY
T
ONE MONTH FROM TO-DAY I'LL BRING HIM BACK TO YOU
THE MAN WHO OPENED IT LOOKED OLD AND LAME
AND WHEN WEE-WUN GAVE THEM TO HIM HE PUT THEM UPON HIS FEET BUT HE DID NOT STIR NOT AN INCH
AND IT WAS TRUE
BUT HE DID NOT TELL ANYBODY FOR FEAR OF BEING LAUGHED AT
THE KING AND QUEEN RODE UPON WHITE HORSES
WHITTIER'S CHILD LIFE IN PROSE OEYVIND DID NOT SEE HIM WHEN HE CAME OUT AFTER DINNER AND THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OF THE FOX
THE WHITE BEAR WAS ALWAYS HIDING NEAR WATCHING THE FIRE
BUT A HUGE OAK-TREE HAS GROWN UP RIGHT AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOWS
GO NOW AND LEAVE US IN PEACE WANG CHIH VISITS THE FIRE DRAGON WANG CHIH SAT ON THE WHITE CRANE'S BACK AND WAS TAKEN UP AND UP AND UP THROUGH THE SKY TO THE CLOUD-CAVE WHERE THE SKY-DRAGON LIVED
THE FIRST FIELD OF BARLEY WAS BETTER THAN THIS ONE THAT IS TRUE SIR ANSWERED THE HONEST OLD MAN
COE ONCE UPON A TIME SOME WORKMEN WERE REPAIRING THE TALL CHIMNEY OF A FACTORY
BUT IF YOU WILL WAIT TILL TO-MORROW DEAR POTATO I WILL CARRY YOU TO ONE-EYE THE POTATO-WIFE--I WILL INDEED AT FIRST THE POTATO WAS UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO THIS BUT AFTER A WHILE IT SAID
EVERY DAY AFTER THAT SO LONG AS SHE LIVED THE OLD WOLF-MOTHER BROUGHT HER FOUR CHILDREN TO THE BISHOP'S PALACE AND HOWLED AT THE GATE FOR THE PORTER TO LET THEM IN
IT HAD A BROWN COAT AND A RED BREAST
BUT THIS I MUST TELL YOU MY WRY-FACE UNLESS YOU TAKE ME HOME IMMEDIATELY TO THE POTATO-WIFE HERE IN THIS PIE-DISH I INTEND TO REMAIN ALAS CRIED WRY-FACE TO-NIGHT I AM SO TIRED I COULD NEVER FIND ONE-EYE
ON A TABLE NEAR AT HAND WERE VARIOUS BASKETS OF THE MOST TEMPTING PEARS AND GRAPES AND PEACHES AND NEAR THEM WERE DISHES OF SWEETMEATS
THEN OUT OF THE FOREST CAME BOUNDING THE GREAT MOTHER-WOLF WITH HER FOUR CHILDREN NOW GROWN TO BE NEARLY AS BIG AS HERSELF
PEGASUS WAS AS SWIFT AS AN EAGLE
AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY HAD TO BREAK THE ICE TO LET THE WHEELS PASS
OFFERO'S HAIR WAS NOW WHITE AS SNOW AND HIS BACK WAS A LITTLE BENT
HOW HE LONGED TO SEE THE NEW COUNTRY TO WHICH THEY WERE GOING
ONLY BE SURE NOT TO STEP ON THE YOUNG CABBAGES THAT FATHER PLANTED KIT AND KAT BOUNCED OUT OF BED IN A MINUTE
AND AS HER HUSBAND WAS DEAD AND SHE WAS VERY POOR SHE WORKED DILIGENTLY ALL THE TIME THAT THEY MIGHT BE WELL FED AND CLOTHED
PEOPLE RIDE ON ELEPHANTS THERE RHODA WOULD SAIL LITTLE TWIGS IN THE STREAM
ALL THE CHILDREN STOOD WITH FOLDED HANDS AND SANG
LOOK THERE'S A RAINBOW CRIED CHRIF
DEAR ME SAID THE LITTLE GIRL THIS WILL NEVER DO AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD WARMED HER HANDS SHE SET TO WORK TO MAKE THE ROOM TIDY
THEY CLIMBED THE DYKE AND CROSSED THE FIELDS AND WALKED ALONG THE ROAD BY THE CANAL
TUG AND WORRY AS HE MIGHT IT WAS NO GOOD
THE WINDS WHISTLE THROUGH THE PINE-TREES AND THE SNOW COMES DOWN FOR DAYS TILL THE VALLEYS ARE AS WHITE AS THE MOUNTAIN-TOPS
I DON'T KNOW WHICH I WANT THE MOST I SHOULD CHOOSE THE PARLOUR SET SAID JULIA
AS THE ROOMS LOOKED JUST AS USUAL NOTHING WAS SAID
YOU MEAN BRING ME A SUPPER NO I DON'T
THAT'S NOT MUCH
I GIVE IT UP SAID PETER
JUST THEN THE WIFE OF THE MAN APPEARED
AS SOON AS HE HEARD WHAT WANG CHIH WANTED HE OPENED TWO WINDOWS AT THE BACK OF THE HUT AND TOLD HIM TO LOOK THROUGH EACH OF THEM IN TURN
HUSH SAID THE EMPEROR
SUDDENLY ROB THOUGHT HE HEARD A FOOTSTEP ON THE STAIRS
AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS A RABBIT
THESE ARE SOME OF THEM
THEN CLOSE THE WINDOW
OH VERY VERY OLD
BROTHER FOX IF YOU DO NOT COME TO MY AID I AM LOST BROTHER FOX CAME OUT OF THE SATCHEL PROMPTLY AND WORKED SO WELL AT HIS TRADE THAT OF ALL THE FOWLS HE FOUND THERE NOT ONE REMAINED ALIVE
AT LAST SHE CAME TO A GREAT RESOLUTION AND SAID IN A CHOKED VOICE
YOU ARE KEEPING BACK PART OF THE TRUTH CRIED HER SCHOOLMATES
THEN THE DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN AND THE KING ENTERED WITH A LARGE SUITE OF GENTLEMEN IN GLITTERING UNIFORMS AND PLUMED HATS
THE FIELDS BARREN
PEPPER NUTMEG C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N CINNAMON OH LOOK AT THAT DEAR LITTLE PUSSY CAT IN THE KITCHEN SAID MOLLY
WELL THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS ROB THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FINE THING TO RUN DOWN THE HIGH STREET AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
STEADY STEADY WE'RE ALWAYS READY IN A MOST CHEERFUL VOICE
HE LOST ONCE TWICE AND EVEN A THIRD TIME
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR SHEEP WHILE YOU ARE GONE NO SAID HANS I CANNOT DO THAT
HERE IS THE COAT
A GOLD-PIECE FELL OUT OF ITS FLEECE UPON THE FLOOR
AND M
AND M
TOM SHAW'S FATHER SAW A BEAR ON THE MOUNTAIN LAST WEEK
THINK OF THAT--A GREAT DOG LIKE PRINCE HANS LOOKED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
HE RUSHED FROM THE WIGWAM AND FLED A MILE BEFORE HE STOPPED TO BREATHE DEEPLY
YOU MUST GO TO THE WHITE HARE OF THE MOON AND ASK HIM FOR A BOTTLE OF THE ELIXIR OF LIFE
BUT HAND ME AN AXE AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO THE SHARPEST AXE IN THE COUNTRY WAS GIVEN HIM
SHE WOULD FOLLOW HIS TRACKS AND THE MARKS THAT HIS WALKING-STICK MADE IN THE GROUND UNTIL SHE CAME TO THE CASTLE OF THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS
HIS FRANTIC LEAPS OF JOY REPAID ME FOR WHAT I HAD DONE SAID LINCOLN
LET ME GO TO THEM HE SAID
A NEW CRY AROSE
SO HE DUG IT UP IN A GREAT HURRY AND CARRIED IT AWAY
THEY WAVED THEIR LEFT HANDS AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE SQUIRTED WITH WATER
GRAZE AWAY LITTLE OX WHILE I SPIN MY FLAX
WE COULD HAVE MORE FUN IF YOU HAD THE KITCHEN AND PARLOUR FURNITURE TOO YES WE COULD SAID MOLLY
HE SET IT DOWN ON THE SPOT THAT HAD BEEN POINTED OUT
NO ONE CAME HOWEVER AND AS HE FELT RATHER HUNGRY HE TOOK OUT THE REMAINING BISCUITS AND HAD A FINE SUPPER
WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE GOAT OH-H-H I HAPPENED TO--TO--TO SELL IT FOR A CAKE AS SOON AS HE HAD UTTERED THE WORD HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS TO SELL THE GOAT FOR A CAKE
BUT OH HOW HARD THE MATTRESS WAS
BUT WHEN ONE HAS A FINE RED CAP WITH A BLUE TASSEL ONE IS TOO FINE TO RIDE ON PEAT LOADS AND ANDERS TROTTED PROUDLY BY
HE HAD WITH HIM A HARPER WHO WOULD PLAY UPON HIS HARP AND SING SWEETLY
HE COULD SCARCELY PUCKER UP HIS MOUTH TO WHISTLE
HER FATHER STOOD BEFORE HER TO KEEP HER FROM HARM
THEN HE FOUND THAT HIS SACK WAS FULL OF PEARLS WHICH HE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER FOR HEIGH-HEAVY THE GIANT WHOSE DAUGHTER SO-SMALL HE WISHED TO MARRY
CAPTAIN SMITH TOLD THE INDIANS THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND AND THAT THE SUN CHASED THE NIGHT AROUND IT
THEY ATE IT SITTING ON THE KITCHEN DOORSTEP
NOW ONE DAY THE HARE CAME TO STEAL THE MAN'S CABBAGE
ONCE A CHESTNUT BURR DROPPED AT THE BOY'S FEET
THEN THE CART CAME TO THE FLUFF-FEATHER AND OVER IT WENT--CRASH BANG SPLUTTER
BUT THE HOP-ABOUT MAN DID NOT NOTICE HIM AT ALL AND WHEN WEE-WUN CRIED OUT TO THE LITTLE BLUE SHOES
BRER WOLF CROSS HIS LEGS EN DEN BRER FOX CROSS HIS'N
OLE BRER RABBIT WUZ OFF SOM'ERS EN BRER WOLF EN BRER FOX WUZ WAITIN FER IM
DADDY WHAT ARE YOU SHARPENING YOUR KNIFE FOR TO FLAY OFF YOUR SKIN THAT I MAY MAKE ME A WARM CAP AGAINST THE WINTER OH
WHEREVER SHE TOUCHED THE GROUND A FIRE BEGAN TO BURN
BLAISDELL POCAHONTAS WAS A BEAUTIFUL INDIAN MAIDEN THE DAUGHTER OF THE GREAT CHIEF POWHATAN AND SHE WAS SO GOOD AND KIND THAT SHE WAS LOVED BY ALL THE TRIBE OVER WHICH HER FATHER RULED
I WILL TRY TO GET TO THE VILLAGE ALONE JUST THEN SEVERAL MEN RODE OUT OF THE WOOD
BLUE-EYED WAS ROB AND FAIR-HAIRED AND PUG-NOSED,--JUST THE SWEETEST TRIFLE HIS MOTHER SAID
HE WENT STRAIGHT UP AND CAME WHERE HE NEVER HAD BEEN BEFORE
HENCEFORTH YOUR LIGHT SHALL BE SO SOFT SO COOL AND SO SILVERY THAT ALL MEN SHALL DELIGHT IN YOU AND YOUR BEAMS
THEN WEE-WUN SIGHED A LONG SIGH AND HE FLEW OVER THE BYE-BYE MEADOW TILL HE REACHED THE GARDEN OF THE STIR-ABOUT WIFE WHICH IS BOUND ABOUT BY A WALL
COME TO MY ASSISTANCE GOOD LADDER OR I AM UNDONE THE LADDER IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT OF THE SATCHEL AND LEANED AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE WELL
THEY DID JUST AS THEIR MOTHER SAID AND DID NOT STEP ON THE YOUNG CABBAGES
RETURN THE MONEY TO THIS UGLY WITCH GROANED THE UNFORTUNATE WIFE
CUCKOO HE CRIED
THE AIR WAS SHARP
HANS THOUGHT THE CHAIN VERY FINE
THERE WAS ROAST TURKEY AND FRIED CHICKEN AND MUTTON AND RICE AND POTATOES AND PEAS AND BEANS AND BAKED APPLES AND CABBAGE AND HOT BISCUITS AND MUFFINS AND BUTTER-CAKES AND GOLDEN SYRUP
HE TUGGED AND TUGGED AND TORE WITH HIS TEETH BUT COULD GET NONE OFF
NEXT MORNING BETWEEN DARK AND DAWN THE OLD WOMAN TOOK HER DISTAFF AND DROVE THE OX INTO THE STEPPE TO GRAZE
UNRAVEL YOUR STOCKING
YOU CAN PLAY THE BASS DRUM AND I CAN PLAY THE FLUTE I WILL GO SAID THE DOG AND THEY BOTH WALKED ON TOGETHER
LET ME GET MY GUN CRIED MR KING
QUA
QUA
QUA
AND PRESENTLY HE SAT DOWN TO HIS MEAL
NOW THESE FEATHERS ARE AS LIGHT AS ANYTHING AND WILL BLOW IN THE WIND
HE WAS KIND-HEARTED
THE OLD MAN WORKED IN THE FIELDS AS A PITCH-BURNER WHILE THE OLD WOMAN SAT AT HOME AND SPUN FLAX
FOR THAT NIGHT WHEN SHE PUT KIT TO BED SHE FELT HIS CLOTHES VERY CAREFULLY--BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT THEIR BEING DAMP
AND HE TURNED AGAIN TO THE MIRROR AS IF TO TAKE A LAST ADMIRING VIEW OF HIS FINERY
HE THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AS IF YOU WERE A KIND BOY NATHAN NATHAN KNEW THAT HIS FATHER WOULD NOT GO AFTER THE BEAR NOW
FOR THAT YOU MUST MIX THE ELIXIR OF LIFE WITH SOME WATER OUT OF THE SKY-DRAGON'S MOUTH AND WHERE IS THE SKY-DRAGON TO BE FOUND INQUIRED WANG CHIH
YOU SHALL AT LEAST BE AS FREE AS I AM SO SAYING HE OPENED THE CAGE DOOR AND THE BIRD FLEW OUT
MEANWHILE WASIS HAD FOUND HIS MAPLE SUGAR AND WAS CALM AGAIN
HOW GAY THEY ALL ARE
SOMETIMES HE TOLD IT TO A GNOME WHO WAS FINE AND FEATHERY AND SOMETIMES TO ONE WHO WAS MAKING BREAD
SHE DID NOT CRY SCOLD OR FRET
THIS IS REAL LIFE IN WHICH CHILDREN SOON BEGIN TO TAKE DECIDED INTEREST
SO BROTHER FOX GOT INTO THE SATCHEL AND TEENCHY DUCK WENT WADDLING ALONG THE ROAD CRYING
I SHALL CHOOSE WITH MY EYES OPEN
BAY-AY-AY IT SAID
BAY-AY-AY IT SAID

THE ROOSTERS IN THE BARNYARD WERE CROWING THE DUCKS IN THE CANAL WERE QUACKING AND ALL THE LITTLE BIRDS IN THE FIELDS WERE SINGING FOR JOY
BUT CHILDREN IF WE STAY HERE WE SHALL NOT CATCH ANY FISH ON THE PIER THEY WENT DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DYKE AND OUT UPON A LITTLE PIER THAT RAN FROM THE SANDY BEACH INTO THE WATER
BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER WEE-WUN HAD PASSED WHEN SHE CAME INTO HER GARDEN TO GATHER EVERY TWENTIETH DANDELION SHE COULD HARDLY SEE A DANDELION BECAUSE OF THE BLOW-AWAYS THAT WERE GROWING EVERYWHERE AND CASTING THEIR FLUFF INTO THE DANDELIONS EYES
THEN TOO HE THOUGHT THAT WHEN HE WAS TIRED OF IT ALL HE WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO KICK ON THE DOOR AND A SERVANT FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD COME AND OPEN IT--HE HAD ALWAYS HAD A SERVANT TO OBEY HIS SLIGHTEST COMMAND
SUCH A SPLENDID CARRIAGE WITH SIX WHITE HORSES PINK SATIN CUSHIONS AND A NEGRO COACHMAN WITH POWDERED HAIR
HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME LOOKING AT AND ADMIRING HIMSELF IN THE WONDERFUL LOOKING-GLASSES THAT HE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME FOR THE BOOKS AND GAMES IN THE PALACE
WHAT HARM COULD COME TO A GREAT DOG LIKE THAT BUT HANS WAS NOT SATISFIED
HE WAS TOO LATE
BY-AND-BY KIT SAID I SEE OUR HOUSE
IT CANNOT BE DONE AND THE KING'S GUARDS SEIZED HIM AND LED HIM AWAY TO PRISON

HE SAID THAT IT WOULD MAKE ME TRUTHFUL
WHY A TABLE SPREAD WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND DRINK AND ROBBERS SITTING AT IT AND HAVING A GOOD TIME THAT OUGHT TO BE OUR SUPPER SAID THE ROOSTER

WRY-FACE WEPT AGAIN WITH HORROR AT THE SIGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOURSELF ALL YOUR TROUBLE BY STAYING WITH US AFTER THE BOYS HAD PASSED THROUGH THE WOODS THEY CAME TO A GREAT ROCKY PLACE BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS
THEN THE SWIFT RUNNERS RAN RACES AND THE SKILFUL MARKSMEN SHOT AT TARGETS
ENOUGH CRIED THE KING

KIT BAITED KAT'S FOR HER BECAUSE KAT SAID IT MADE HER ALL WRIGGLY INSIDE TO DO IT
THE FLOOR WAS MADE OF A BEAUTIFUL RED COPPER THAT SHONE IN THE SUNLIGHT LIKE BURNISHED GOLD AND SEEMED ALMOST A DARK RED IN THE SHADOW

SEE MOTHER YOU NEED NOT FEAR
THEY WERE ALL AS BUSY AS THEY COULD BE SO HE JUST SAT DOWN ON A PINE STUMP AND WATCHED THEM
PEOPLE CAME TO SEE HIM FROM FAR AND NEAR WHO MADE HIM PRESENTS AND ASKED HIM QUESTIONS AND ATE HIS DINNERS

SLAY ME NOT IVAN TSAREVICH
THE SHEEP DO NOT KNOW YOUR VOICE--AND THEN HE STOPPED
SHE CHASED THE FLEETING HORSE AND SNAPPED AT THE LOOSE END OF THE HUNTSMAN'S CLOAK HOWLING WITH GRIEF AND ANGER
I WILL NEVER PLAY A TRICK ON ANYONE AGAIN NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE THE POT OF GOLD HORACE E
I HAVE SPENT YOUR SIXPENCE

COME AND SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HE CALLED TO HIS WIFE
I WONDER WHY ANYONE IS BREAKING STONES UP THERE SAID JACK
HE TWISTED HIMSELF LIKE AN EEL BETWEEN THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS OF THE COURTIERS AND OVER THE SOLDIERS MUSKETS HE JUMPED LIKE A LITTLE RABBIT
AND THE KING HIMSELF WORE AN ERMINE-BORDERED PURPLE MANTLE WHICH TRAILED BEHIND HIM AND HE HAD A LARGE GOLD CROWN ON HIS WHITE CURLY HAIR
FOOTNOTE 9
AS IT WAS THE PEOPLE ON THE COAST LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE WATER TOWARD JAPAN AND SAW THREE INKY-BLACK CLOUDS STRETCHING FROM THE SKY INTO THE SEA
HE SHOWED THEM HIS COMPASS AND TOLD THEM HOW IT GUIDED HIM THROUGH THE FOREST
NEXT MORNING SHE WAS AWAKE WITH THE CHICKENS AND COOKED A NICE BREAKFAST
I LONG TO SEE THEM ALL
GIVE ME BACK MY BEAUTIFUL MONEY IT WAS NIGHT AND THE PRINCE OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN COWS ORDERED ONE OF HIS SERVANTS TO TAKE TEENCHY DUCK AND SHUT HER UP IN THE HENHOUSE WITH THE TURKEYS THE GEESE AND THE CHICKENS THINKING THAT THESE FOWLS WOULD KILL THE STRANGER AND THAT HER DISAGREEABLE SONG WOULD FOR EVER BE AT AN END
WHEREFORE ART THOU SO SAD
HIS SECOND MOTHER WAS THE KIND WOLF

THE KING'S PALACE IS A VERY GRAND PLACE
I HAVE HAD NO FOOD FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS AND KNOW NOT WHERE TO SEEK IT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GO TO THE LAKE AND DIP YOUR TAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE BANK OR THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ICE IF THE WATER HAS FROZEN OVER AGAIN AS I EXPECT IT HAS DONE FROM THE NIP IN THE AIR
SHE SAID NO I HAVE NOT FOUND ALL OF THEM FOR SOME HAVE WANDERED FAR

SOME OF THE FLAKES FELL ON ROB'S FACE AND ROUSED HIM FROM HIS SLEEP
THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES THERE ONCE LIVED AN EMPEROR WHO WAS SO FOND OF FINE CLOTHES THAT HE SPENT GREAT SUMS OF MONEY IN ORDER TO BE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED
THE OTHER HARE BOUNDED OFF IN PURSUIT HUNTED HIM DOWN AND TORE HIM TO BITS
THEN SHE TURNED TO WEED THE BOAT-GARDEN
