THE DAY FOR THE MATCH HAD COME
MY FRIEND DOES WELL TO REMIND ME
BUT THE FEELING HERE IN THE CITY IS BECOMING VERY STRONG
THINKING OF ALL THIS I WAS VERY MELANCHOLY WHEN I WAS SUMMONED DOWN TO TEA BY ONE OF THE STEWARDS WHO ATTENDED THE OFFICERS MESS
MR NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN,--AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT,--"IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH IS SO PLEASANT TO ME AND EVA'S SMILES AND HAPPINESS
THE ACTUAL CLAY WILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE EITHER FOR THE EYE TO SEE OR THE NOSE TO SMELL THEY ALL SAY THAT WHEN YOU TRIED THE FURNACES THERE WAS A SAVOUR OF BURNT PORK NOW GREAT TROUBLE WAS TAKEN IN THAT MATTER OF CREMATION
AND I FELT THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONSOLATION TO ME IN GOING AWAY TO ENGLAND SO THAT I MIGHT ESCAPE FROM THE GREAT VEXATION AND EYESORE WHICH THE EMPTY COLLEGE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
HE KEPT CHOPPING AT THE BALL WHICH ALWAYS WENT BEHIND TILL HE HAD MADE A GREAT SCORE
SHE WASN'T AT ALL THE WOMAN TO LET A YEAR GO BY BEFORE SHE CONGRATULATED HER SISTER WE HAVE YOUR OWN SIGNATURE AFFIRMING THE DATE HOW WAS I TO KNOW WHEN I WAS BORN
THE YOUNG MARQUIS OF MARYLEBONE THEIR LEADER IS TO STAY AT OUR HOUSE
GOD BLESS THEIR GOLD BANDS SAID HE OF THE RED NOSE
IF A MURDERER BE HANGED,--IN ENGLAND I MEAN FOR IN BRITANNULA WE HAVE NO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT,--IS THAT MURDER
JACK SAID I WITH THE KINDEST VOICE WHICH I WAS ABLE TO ASSUME YOU WILL PACK UP YOUR PORTMANTEAU AND GO TO NEW ZEALAND THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW
TO THE STATE THE LIFE OF A WOMAN SHOULD BE JUST THE SAME AS THAT OF A MAN
IT IS FITTING FOR US AT ANY RATE THAT WE SHOULD DO SO TILL WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY HIM TO A STATE OF GOD-LIKE KNOWLEDGE INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO THAT WHICH WE AT PRESENT POSSESS HERE I COULD PERCEIVE THAT SIR FERDINANDO WAS REVELLING IN THE SOUNDS OF HIS OWN WORDS AND THAT HE HAD PREPARED AND LEARNT BY HEART THE TONES OF HIS VOICE AND EVEN THE MOTION OF HIS HANDS
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT THE CABINS HAD BEEN DESIGNED FOR THE USE OF A TRAVELLING ADMIRAL AND I GATHERED FROM THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ALLOTTED TO ME AN IDEA THAT ENGLAND INTENDED TO ATONE FOR THE INJURY DONE TO THE COUNTRY BY PERSONAL RESPECT SHOWN TO THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
YOU PUT THE KISSES OF A PRETTY GIRL WHO MAY PERHAPS MAKE YOU A GOOD WIFE,--AND AGAIN MAY MAKE YOU A BAD ONE,--AGAINST ALL THE WORLD IN ARMS I AM QUITE SURE ABOUT THAT SAID JACK
THE GREAT DOCTRINE OF A FIXED PERIOD WAS RECEIVED BY THEM AT FIRST WITH RIDICULE AND THEN WITH DISMAY
JACK CAME IN AND TOOK HIS CHAIR AT THE TABLE IN GRIM SILENCE
I HAVE TRIED IT AND I KNOW IT
I HATE THESE LECTURES NOT AS THINKING THEM UNBECOMING BUT AS BEING PECULIARLY DISAGREEABLE
DURING THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS I HAD DEVOTED A GREAT PORTION OF THIS TO THE EXTERNAL ADORNMENT OF THE COLLEGE NOT WITHOUT MANY WORDS ON THE MATTER FROM MRS NEVERBEND
I SUPPOSE HE WOULD DO THAT SAID GRUNDLE EXPRESSING CONSIDERABLE INTEREST BY THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
AND THAT IF ONE COULD GET AT A MAIDEN'S HEART WE SHOULD FIND THAT EVA THOUGHT SO
AND SHE AFTER SUCH WORDS MUST DROP HIM FOR EVER
I WAS FORCED TO BE IN A CERTAIN DEGREE CHEERFUL BUT GRAVE AND SOLEMN IN MY CHEERFULNESS
LOOKING FORWARD I COULD SEE EVA KNEELING AT MY FEET AND COULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE INVINCIBLE STRENGTH OF THAT WEAKNESS TO WHICH CROSSTREES HAD ALLUDED
IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO BEAR THE INCIDENTS YOU SHOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE BUSINESS BUT IN ENGLAND I SHOULD NOT HAVE A SINGLE DISCIPLE
IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS YOU WILL BE QUITE--CHEERFUL HERE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT MR PRESIDENT
MR PRESIDENT SAID HE I AM IN COMMAND OF HER MAJESTY'S GUNBOAT THE JOHN BRIGHT AND I HAVE COME TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LADIES I AM SURE THE LADIES HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN SEEING YOU I LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND THERE WITH OTHER OF OUR FAIR CITIZENS I SAW EVA
HOW WILL THE COMING AGES OF MEN BE AFFECTED BY SUCH A CHANGE AS I PROPOSE SHOULD SUCH A CHANGE BECOME THE NORMAL CONDITION OF DEATH
THERE WILL BE A COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO YOU IF YOU DO NOT MIND YOURSELF AND THEN YOU WILL REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
FOR WOMEN HE SEEMED TO CARE NOTHING NOR FOR BISHOPS NOR FOR JUDGES NOR FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT
PERISH JACK'S MOTHER BEFORE I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BRIBED IN THIS MANNER TO ABANDON THE GREAT OBJECT OF ALL MY LIFE
HE IS SURE THAT MR CRASWELLER WON'T MIND THEN HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT TO MY OLD FRIEND
NOW THIS WAS A LIE
BUT PERHAPS THE WORST FEATURE OF IT ALL WAS THE ARRIVAL JUST NOW AT GLADSTONOPOLIS OF A CROWD OF EDUCATED ENGLISHMEN
WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE ME TO DO WITH MYSELF TO BEGIN WITH HE PAUSED BEFORE HE REPLIED AND LOOKED PAINFULLY INTO MY FACE
HE HAD BEEN COLONEL OF THE CURRICULUM AS THEY NOW CALL THE HEAD BOY
THE SNOW IS NOW DISAPPEARING IN GREAT QUANTITIES BUT AN OLD BIRD IS NOT TO BE CAUGHT WITH CHAFF
I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LAW
I DID IT AT FIRST SIMPLY BECAUSE I HATED GRUNDLE
I DO NOT THINK THAT IT BECOMES EITHER OF US TO BE AFRAID OF IT THAT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU HE REPLIED
THE TOWN-HALL
THE TOWN-HALL
AND I COULD NOT BUT TELL MYSELF THAT IF IN COMING YEARS THESE TENEMENTS SHOULD BE LEFT TENANTLESS MY COUNTRY WOULD LOOK BACK UPON ME AS ONE WHO HAD WASTED THE PRODUCE OF HER YOUNG ENERGIES
AND I WAS ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE TRAP-DOOR HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN EITHER BY CHANCE OR BY DESIGN,--THE VERY TRAP-DOOR WHICH WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT ANY SUCH ESCAPE DURING THE MOMENTS OF FULL CREMATION,--SO THAT THERE NEED BE NO FEAR OF A REPETITION OF THE ACCIDENT
THIS I READ WITH GREAT ATTENTION WHILE THEY SAT SILENT
I DARESAY WE SHALL DROP IT BEFORE LONG IN ENGLAND
AT THE DOOR OF MY HOUSE I FOUND A DOZEN OF THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS WITH A SERGEANT
HOW OR WHEN SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY OR WHITHER I COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT THINK
CHAPTER VIII
IT IS NOT SO IT IS--IT IS
AT LAST JUST AS EVERY CLOCK UPON THE GROUND STRUCK SIX WITH THAT WONDERFUL UNANIMITY WHICH OUR CLOCKS HAVE ATTAINED SINCE THEY WERE ALL REGULATED BY WIRES FROM GREENWICH JACK SENT A BALL FLYING UP INTO THE AIR PERFECTLY REGARDLESS WHETHER IT MIGHT BE CAUGHT OR NOT KNOWING WELL THAT THE ONE NOW NEEDED WOULD BE SCORED BEFORE IT COULD COME DOWN FROM THE HEAVENS INTO THE HANDS OF ANY ENGLISHMAN
SIR SAID I A FATHER'S BLESSING HAS MUCH MORE THAN A PECUNIARY VALUE
WHOSE IS THIS IMAGE AND SUPERSCRIPTION HE ASKED
I MUST EXPLAIN THAT DURING THESE LAST FEW WEEKS THINGS HAD NOT GONE QUIETLY IN GLADSTONOPOLIS BUT THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING LIKE A SERIOUS RIOT
IF IT HAD BEEN TALLOWAX THAT YOU WERE TO BEGIN WITH OR EXORS YOU MIGHT HAVE BURNT EM UP WITHOUT A WORD FROM ME I AM GRATIFIED AT HEARING THAT THOUGH THE FIXED PERIOD DOES SEEM TO BE HORRIBLE I WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED ALL THAT AT YOUR BIDDING
WERE NOT BETTER DONE AS OTHERS USE I SAID TO MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS I SAT THERE WEARIED WITH THIS CONTEST AND THINKING OF THE MUCH MORE FRIGHTFUL AGONY I SHOULD BE CALLED UPON TO ENDURE WHEN THE TIME HAD ACTUALLY COME FOR THE DEPARTURE OF OLD CRASWELLER
WHO IS MORE USEFUL THAN HE IS NOTHING HAD BEEN MORE UNLUCKY TO ME AS THE PROMOTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD THAN THE PECULIAR HEALTHINESS AND GENERAL SANITY OF HIM WHO WAS BY CHANCE TO BE OUR FIRST MARTYR
HOW BEST SHALL WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE DAY WHICH WE KNOW CANNOT BE AVOIDED
TO THIS WAS TO BE ADDED A CERTAINTY THAT DEATH WOULD COME ON SOME PREARRANGED DAY
CHAPTER II
BOBBS WAS WITH HIM THE WHOLE MORNING AND ASSURED HIS MOTHER THAT IF HE COULD GO OUT AND TAKE EXERCISE HIS EYE WOULD BE ALL RIGHT
THERE WAS A WAVING OF HANDKERCHIEFS AND A HOLDING UP OF HATS AND ALL THOSE SIGNS OF ENTHUSIASM WHICH ARE WONT TO GREET THE POPULAR MAN OF THE HOUR
I ADVISE YOU NOT TO THROW OVER AND FOR EVER THE AFFECTION THE FOSTERING CARE AND ALL THE COMFORTS PECUNIARY AS WELL AS OTHERS WHICH YOU HAVE HITHERTO HAD FROM AN INDULGENT FATHER YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU WILL DISINHERIT THE BOY SAID MRS NEVERBEND
AS FOR TURNING HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE OR STOPPING HIS POCKET-MONEY THAT WOULD BE CARRYING THE JOKE FURTHER THAN I COULD DO IT
AND THIS WOULD BE EFFECTED BY A MEASURE DOING MORE GOOD TO THE AGED THAN TO ANY OTHER CLASS OF THE COMMUNITY
IN THOSE BATTLES WHICH HAVE RAVISHED THE NORTH-WEST OF INDIA DURING THE LAST HALF-CENTURY DID THE ALMIGHTY WISH THAT MEN SHOULD PERISH MISERABLY BY TEN THOUSANDS AND TWENTY THOUSANDS
I RETIRED TO THE LIEUTENANT'S CABIN AND THERE DISCUSSED THE WHOLE HISTORY OF BRITANNULA OVER MANY A PROLONGED CIGAR
CHAPTER III
A DIVINE IDEA HAS TO BE MADE COMMON TO MEN'S MINDS BY FREQUENT VENTILATION BEFORE IT WILL BE SEEN TO BE FIT FOR HUMANITY
THEY'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO COME UP THE HILL MR BUNNIT SAID THE BAR-KEEPER TO THE TANNER AS SOON AS EVER THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR BOATS GOD BLESS THE OLD FLAG FOR EVER AND EVER SAID MR BUNNIT
BUT THEN HOW FAR WOULD THE TALLOWAXES AND BARNESES AND EXORS OF THE DAY BE LED BY MY EXAMPLE
BUT I THOUGHT THAT I COULD SEE AS I GLANCED AT HIS FACE THAT HE TOOK A STRONG INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
GUNBOAT THE JOHN BRIGHT WERE THE HAPPY FEW WHO HAD CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE TREE
IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO JACK
IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO JACK
JACK WHO WAS QUICK ENOUGH AT UNDERSTANDING THE ASPECT OF THINGS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO ASK THE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WOULD SEE THEIR OLD FRIEND CRASWELLER MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD
THE WORLD WAS CLEARLY NOT YET ALIVE TO THE GRAND THINGS IN STORE FOR IT
HE IS TO BE SACRIFICED BECAUSE WHEN THINKING OF OTHER THINGS HE DID NOT CARE TO DIFFER WITH YOU THEN SHE PAUSED AS THOUGH TO SEE WHETHER I MIGHT NOT YIELD TO HER WORDS
AND WHAT THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE TO DEPART A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE HE WAS WORN OUT STILL HE WOULD DO SO WITH EVERYTHING AROUND HIM TO MAKE HIM HAPPY AND WOULD DEPART BEFORE HE HAD EVER KNOWN THE AGONY OF A HEADACHE
IF IT BE SO I SAID ALOUD IN THE OFFICE JACK NEVERBEND SHALL SLEEP THIS NIGHT IN PRISON BUT IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME AT THE MOMENT THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY I SHOULD HAVE FORMAL EVIDENCE THAT JACK WAS CONSPIRING AGAINST THE LAWS BEFORE I COULD SEND HIM TO JAIL
HE HAD ALREADY SCORED NEARLY 1000 WHEN YOUNG GRABBE WAS CAUGHT OUT
HERE EVERY COMFORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR HIM SO THAT HE MAY DEPART FROM THIS WORLD WITHOUT A PANG WHEN IN THE COURSE OF YEARS HE SHALL HAVE LIVED BEYOND THE PERIOD AT WHICH HE CAN WORK AND BE USEFUL BUT LOOK AT MR CRASWELLER FATHER
YOU HAVE GOT RID AT ANY RATE OF ONE TERRIBLE BOTHER
THEN IT MAY COME TO PASS THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO VISIT THE WONDERFUL GLORIES OF MOUNT EARNSHAWE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT SAID JACK AS I SHUT THE DOOR
AND THAT IF HE WOULD DO ME THE HONOUR TO LISTEN TO A FEW WORDS WHICH I PROPOSED TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA BEFORE I LEFT THEM HE WOULD HAVE CLEARER IDEAS ABOUT IT THAN HAD EVER YET ENTERED INTO HIS MIND
HE TOUCHED THE BALL AND AWAY IT FLEW BEHIND THE WICKET
THEN FURTHER OFF BUT STILL IN THE CIRCLE ROUND THE TEMPLE THERE WERE SMALLER ABODES LESS LUXURIOUS BUT STILL COMFORTABLE ALL OF WHICH WOULD IN A FEW SHORT YEARS BE INHABITED,--IF THE FIXED PERIOD COULD BE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY PROJECT
COME AND TAKE SOME TIFFIN AN ENGLISHMAN WHEN HE COMES TO OUR SIDE OF THE GLOBE ALWAYS CALLS HIS LUNCH TIFFIN
THE HAMLET HAD NOT YET BUILT ITSELF AND ROUND THE HANDSOME GATES THERE WAS NOTHING AT PRESENT BUT A DESERT
BUT AT THIS TIME ON THE MEMORABLE OCCASION OF THE EATING OF THAT DINNER IT FIRST BEGAN TO STRIKE ME THAT MY FRIEND CRASWELLER WAS GETTING VERY NEAR HIS FIXED PERIOD AND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK MYSELF QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE THE DAUGHTER'S WISHES
IF WE ARE DRIVEN TO A PINCH THAT WILL BE THE LAST THING TO DO
WERE HE TO DO SO HE WOULD INCUR MY GRAVE DISPLEASURE,--AND CONSEQUENT PUNISHMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO TO THE BOY ASKED MRS NEVERBEND
NOW JACK IS DETERMINED THAT YOU SHAN'T AND I SAY THAT HE IS RIGHT
EVA'S NAME WAS IN EVERY ONE'S MOUTH TILL MY WIFE WAS NEARLY BESIDE HERSELF WITH ANGER
THAT MAN IS A KNAVE I COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER THAT GRUNDLE HAD BEEN A FIXED-PERIODIST AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BECOME ME TO ABUSE HIM
BUT I COULD ONLY PRETEND NOT TO SEE THEM AS OUR CARRIAGE PASSED ON
NOTHING WOULD REMAIN OF ME BUT THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO HAD CAUSED THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA TO BE DESTROYED AND HER GOVERNMENT TO BE RESUMED BY HER OLD MISTRESS
THE NEXT THAT YOU WILL HEAR OF YOUR FATHER WILL BE THE PUBLICATION OF A LITTLE BOOK THAT I SHALL WRITE ON THE JOURNEY ADVOCATING THE FIXED PERIOD
AT GREAT LABOUR AND EXPENSE HE EXPORTED FROM NEW ZEALAND A SMALL FLOCK OF CHOICE ANIMALS WITH WHICH HE WAS SUCCESSFUL FROM THE FIRST
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAKE JACK UNDERSTAND THAT A RULE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND TO BE APPLICABLE TO THE WORLD AT LARGE WAS NOT FITTED FOR SOME PECULIAR INDIVIDUAL BUT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THIS HOME TO THE MIND OF MRS NEVERBEND
THERE IS NOTHING SO HARD BUT THAT ENTHUSIASM WILL MAKE IT TOLERABLE
HE ONLY ASKED FOR A YEAR
I COULD SEE THE COLOUR COME AND GO IN HIS FACE AS HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE BALL AND PEEPED DOWN TO GET ITS BEARING
AND THIS DEPOSITING OF CRASWELLER WAS TO BE THE FIRST AND SHOULD--ACCORDING TO MY OWN INTENTIONS--BE ATTENDED WITH A PECULIAR GRACE AND REVERENCE
SHIP THE JOHN BRIGHT IN HER COMMANDING POSITION WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DELAY HERE HE TURNED ROUND AND BOWED TO THE OFFICERS AND BY KEEN EYES MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO BOW THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALSO TO THE VESSEL WHICH LAY A MILE OFF IN THE HARBOUR
I SOMETIMES THOUGHT OF A MORE IMMEDIATE DATE IN WHICH I MYSELF MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO BE DEPOSITED AND THAT I MIGHT THUS BE ALLOWED TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF A HAPPY FINAL YEAR PASSED WITHIN THE COLLEGE
TO LIE QUIVERING AND QUAKING ON MY BED AT THE EXPECTATION OF THE BLACK ANGEL OF DEATH DOES NOT SUIT MY MANHOOD,--WHICH WOULD FEAR NOTHING;--WHICH DOES NOT AND SHALL NOT STAND IN AWE OF AUGHT BUT MY OWN SINS
I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHAT IT IS THAT ABRAHAM GRUNDLE IS AFTER
I SHALL NOT BE HERE TO WISH YOU JOY AT YOUR WEDDING WHY ARE YOU TO GO IF YOU DON'T WISH IT I PROMISED THAT I WOULD GO WHEN CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TALKED OF CARRYING ME OFF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
BUT IT IS HARDLY AFTERWARDS MUCH REMEMBERED AND IS EFFICACIOUS ONLY IN SMOOTHING SOMEWHAT THE ROUGH WAYS OF THIS HARSH WORLD
IF HE COULD NOT SEE THAT JACK WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH EVA HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL
WHETHER YOUR GUN BE LOADED OR NOT MATTERS LITTLE IT IS CERTAINLY LOADED SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
BUT HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO ASSURING ME THAT I SHOULD BE RECEIVED IN ENGLAND WITH EVERY DISTINCTION AND THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE INVITED TO WINDSOR CASTLE
IF YOU CANNOT HOLD YOUR TONGUE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AND ABSTAIN FROM MAKING PUBLIC ADDRESSES IN THE MARKET-PLACE YOU SHALL GO OUT OF BRITANNULA
BUT CRASWELLER TOOK MY PLACE
SAYS THAT SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT FOR ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS
LOEWENSTEIN M.D AND DELPHINE LETTAU THE FIXED PERIOD BY ANTHONY TROLLOPE FIRST PUBLISHED ANONYMOUSLY IN BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE IN 1882
SITTING THERE AND TURNING IT ALL OVER IN MY MIND WHILE MY EYES RESTED ON THE BRIGHT EXPANSE OF THE GLASS-CLEAR SEA I DID PERCEIVE THAT THE FIXED PERIOD WITH ALL ITS ADVANTAGES WAS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT IT MUST NECESSARILY BE POSTPONED TO AN AGE PREPARED FOR IT
HOW MUCH THEN DEPENDED ON THE WORDS WHICH I MIGHT USE
EVA'S MOTHER WAS NOW DEAD AND NO OTHER CHILD HAD BEEN BORN
OF COURSE WE ARE SUPPOSING THAT IT IS FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE STRUCK
AS I SAT THERE ALONE I HAD ALMOST DETERMINED TO YIELD
WHEREAS ABRAHAM GRUNDLE WITH A STEADINESS BEYOND HIS YEARS GAVE HIMSELF UP MORE THAN EVER TO THE BUSINESS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND EXPRESSED SOME CONTEMPT FOR THE GAME THOUGH HE WAS NO MEAN PLAYER
NOBODY IN ENGLAND WOULD WANT ME OR WOULD CARE FOR ME AND I SHOULD BE UTTERLY FRIENDLESS THERE AND ALONE
YOU SEE IT'S A PUBLIC SUBJECT ON A PUBLIC MATTER AND I DON'T SEE THAT FATHER AND SON HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
WE HAD HOWEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT NO COMMUNITY EVER PLAYED CRICKET AS DID THE BRITANNULANS
AND HE WAS ONE WELL INCLINED TO BUSINESS IN WHOSE HANDS THE FIRM OF GRUNDLE GRABBE CRASWELLER WAS LIKELY TO THRIVE
MEN WILL NEVER BE SO WEAK I SAID
AS FOR BARNES HE HAS GONE OUT OF WHAT LITTLE WITS HE EVER HAD WITH THE FRIGHT OF IT AND PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU COULDN'T TOUCH A LUNATIC BARNES IS NO MORE A LUNATIC THAN I AM I ONLY TELL YOU WHAT FOLK TELL ME
BUT I PERCEIVED THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT HE DID NOT THAT SHE WAS QUITE PREPARED TO GIVE HERSELF TO HIM AND THAT THERE WAS NO REAL OBSTACLE BETWEEN HIM AND ALL THE FLOCKS AND HERDS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
IT WILL NOT BE WANTED UP THERE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE PLACE I REPLIED
FROM THAT MOMENT ALL QUIET HAD LEFT ME AND ALL HAPPINESS
THEN HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CARRIAGE AND I CAME OUT
AH YES
AND WHAT HAD ENGLAND TO DO WITH OUR LAWS
I HAVE A SON OF MY OWN AND I HAVE CAREFULLY EDUCATED HIM TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY IN WHICH HE SHALL DEPOSIT ME THERE AS THE PROUDEST OF HIS LIFE
THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO SOLACE OR TO ENCOURAGE ME
I REMEMBER IT ALL AS WELL AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY WHEN WE FIRST AGREED TO COME AWAY FROM NEW ZEALAND
ALL THESE TIDINGS CAME TO US FROM JACK AND JACK WAS IN THIS INSTANCE SOMEWHAT LED ASTRAY
IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A EUTHANASIA WAS TO BE PREPARED FOR THEM;--AND HOW MANY AS MEN NOW ARE DOES A EUTHANASIA AWAIT
BE THAT TRUE BENUMBING DEATH WHICH WE THINK MAY PUT AN END OR AT ANY RATE GIVE A CHANGE TO ALL OUR THOUGHTS
THERE WERE AS I KNEW TWO OR THREE OLD WOMEN LIVING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND WHO WOULD IN DUE COURSE COME IN TOWARDS THE END OF CRASWELLER'S YEAR
I WAS SO ANGERED BY THEIR WATCHFULNESS THAT I WAS HALF MINDED TO TURN MY TRICYCLE AND ALLOW THEM TO PURSUE ME ABOUT THE ISLAND
WHEN WE NAMED OUR METROPOLIS AFTER HIM WE WERE AWARE OF HIS GOOD QUALITIES
HOW WILL IT BE HE HAD SAID IF THEY MIZZLE HE HAD INTENDED TO ALLUDE TO THE POSSIBLE PREMATURE DEPARTURE OF THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO BE DEPOSITED
I WAS HOWEVER WELL AWARE THAT AN HOUR OF DESPAIR AND OPPOSITION AND OF DEFEAT WAS COMING UPON ME
THE COLLEGE
THE COLLEGE
HE WAS A MAN WHOM I REGARDED AS INDIFFERENT TO LENGTH OF LIFE BUT ONE WHO WOULD UPON THE WHOLE RATHER FACE SUCH LOT AS NATURE MIGHT INTEND FOR HIM THAN SEEK TO IMPROVE IT BY ANY NEW REFORM
I DO THINK THAT YOU ARE CRUEL
IT IS NOT HIS RELIGION BUT HIS STRENGTH THAT HAS PREVAILED
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT SOME CONSTABLE OR CREMATOR,--SOME SORT OF FIRST HANGMAN,--WOULD HAVE COME TO HIM AND TAKEN HIM BY THE NAPE OF HIS NECK AND CUT HIS THROAT JUST BECAUSE HE WAS SIXTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD
HE WAS EXACTLY OF MY AGE AS WAS ALSO HIS WIFE
THOUGH I MIGHT PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT I WOULD CERTAINLY ENDEAVOUR TO CARRY OUT THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIXED PERIOD
THAT DREAM HAS BEEN DREAMED,--AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT
NOW SIR KENNINGTON HAD COME IN HIS WAY AND HE BY NO MEANS CARRIED HIS MODESTY SO FAR AS TO ABSTAIN FROM QUARRELLING WITH HIM
AND LET THE KETTLE TO THE TRUMPET SPEAK THE TRUMPET TO THE CANNONEER WITHOUT THE CANNONS TO THE HEAVENS THE HEAVENS TO EARTH
THEY WERE CIVIL ENOUGH IN THEIR DEMEANOUR TO ME PERSONALLY BUT THEY HAD ALL BEEN TAUGHT THAT I WAS DEVOTED TO THE SLAUGHTER OF OLD MEN
AS WE WENT UP THE TOWN HILL I COULD ESPY BARNES GIBBERING ON THE DOORSTEP OF HIS HOUSE AND TALLOWAX BRANDISHING A LARGE KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND EXORS WAVING A PAPER OVER HIS HEAD WHICH I WELL KNEW TO BE A COPY OF THE ACT OF OUR ASSEMBLY
I HAD SEEN HIM CONSTANTLY DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS BUT HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO ME ON THE SUBJECT
BUT WHAT COULD I DO IN THE AGONY OF THE MOMENT
AS I LEFT HIM ON THE DAY BEFORE THAT ON WHICH HE WAS TO BE DEPOSITED I ASSURED HIM THAT I WOULD CALL FOR HIM ON THE MORROW
YOUR PROMISED BRIDE SEEMS TO HAVE IT ALL HER OWN WAY SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TO JACK WHEN AT LAST THE LADIES HAD WITHDRAWN
INDEED IT WAS LEG-BEFORE-WICKET AS THE POOR MAN FELT WHEN HE WAS ASSISTED BACK TO HIS TENT
THE OFFICERS OF THE GUNBOAT WERE NOT PRESENT HAVING OCCUPIED THEMSELVES NO DOUBT IN BANKING UP THEIR FIRES
YOU KNOW HIM AND I KNOW HIM AND HE IS WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT ENGLAND
AND YOU WHO MUST BE SO BUSY JUST BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE I COULD NOT GO WITHOUT A WORD OF FAREWELL TO YOU I HAD NOT SPOKEN WITH HIM SINCE WE HAD PARTED ON THE TOP OF THE HILL ON OUR WAY OUT TO THE COLLEGE WHEN THE HORSES HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE CARRIAGE AND HE HAD WALKED BACK TO LIFE AND LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH INSTEAD OF MAKING HIS WAY TO HIS LAST HOME AND TO FIND DEPOSITION WITH ALL THE GLORY OF A GREAT NAME
OH HOW VAIN HOW WRETCHED SOUNDED THAT CONGRATULATION IN MY OWN EARS
AND YET I HAD BEEN RIGHT
AND MY LORD MARYLEBONE BEHAVES HIMSELF QUITE LIKE A BRITISH PEER SAID THE WIFE OF THE MAYOR OF GLADSTONOPOLIS,--A LADY WHOM HE HAD MARRIED IN ENGLAND AND WHO HAD NOT MOVED THERE IN QUITE THE HIGHEST CIRCLES
CRASWELLER AS SOON AS HE SAW THIS SAID THAT HE PRESUMED HE MIGHT GO BACK AS HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GO ON
AND IF SO HOW LARGE A BODY OF COUSINS WOULD BE GENERATED
QUITE LATELY HE HAD SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT,--NOR HAD SHE
EACH OF THEM HAD TWO BICYCLES FOR HIS OWN USE AND AS THEY WERE ALL CONSTRUCTED WITH THE NEW DOUBLE-ACTING LEVERS THEY PASSED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ALONG THE BICYCLE TRACK BETWEEN THE CITY AND CRASWELLER'S HOUSE WITH ASTONISHING RAPIDITY
CRASWELLER WON'T BE A BIT READIER NEXT YEAR THAN HE IS THIS
I DO BELIEVE HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP THEN I GAVE MYSELF INFINITE CREDIT FOR THE PERTINACITY OF MY SILENCE AND FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD PUT ON AN APPEARANCE OF SOMNOLENCY WITHOUT OVERACTING THE PART
BUT I WAS AWARE THAT IT WAS PARTLY SETTLED BETWEEN HER AND JACK AND MRS NEVERBEND
THAT WAS WHAT WAS SAID WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE YACHT
THESE ALL REFERRED MANIFESTLY TO THE CONDITION OF HIM WHO WAS TO GO AND IN NO DEGREE AFFECTED THE WELFARE OF THOSE WHO WERE TO REMAIN
FOR GRUNDLE I FELT NOTHING BUT PERSONAL DISLIKE
THE LAW DEMANDS IT NO NO
BUT YOU HAVE MY WORD AND I WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT EVEN TO SAVE MY LIFE
OF COURSE AS THE TIME DREW NEARER THE QUESTION OF CRASWELLER'S DEPOSITION BECAME GENERALLY DISCUSSED BY THE PUBLIC OF GLADSTONOPOLIS
BUT STILL IT MIGHT BE DONE BY PRACTICE,--BY PRACTICE
DAYS AND WEEKS MEAN NOTHING WITH ME NOW
HE IS A NASTY MEAN FELLOW AND I WILL NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE
AND IN THE CHAIR ON MY LEFT WAS PLACED MY WIFE
STATISTICS ALSO HAVE TOLD US THAT THE UNPROFITABLE YOUNG AND THE NO LESS UNPROFITABLE OLD FORM A THIRD OF THE POPULATION
THE LIVING ON BOARD THE JOHN BRIGHT IS EXCEEDINGLY GOOD AS I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO LEARN FROM MANY DINNERS EATEN THERE SINCE THAT DAY
THE COUNTRY HAS SINCE UNDOUBTEDLY PROSPERED AND IN A MATERIAL POINT OF VIEW HAS GIVEN US NO GROUNDS FOR REGRET
I WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT IN SPITE OF JACK'S SPEECHIFYING THE YOUNGER PART OF THE POPULATION WAS STILL TRUE TO ME AND I DID NOT DOUBT THAT I SHOULD STILL HAVE GOT THE MAJORITY OF VOTES IN THE ASSEMBLY
BUT HE WILL NOT COME IN TILL A DAY OR TWO AFTER CRASWELLER'S DEPARTURE THEY ALL WILL COME
BUT A GREAT TROUBLE AROSE WHICH HOWEVER RATHER ASSISTED JACK IN HIS OWN PROSPECTS IN THE LONG-RUN,--THOUGH FOR A TIME IT SEEMED TO HAVE ANOTHER EFFECT
AT THREE O'CLOCK WE ALL WENT INTO OUR GREAT TOWN-HALL TO HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO HAD TO SAY TO US
THEN THEY TALKED TO US OF METHUSELAH AND ENDEAVOURED TO DRAW AN ARGUMENT FROM THE AGE OF THE PATRIARCHS
IT HAD SOMETIMES BEEN THAT BY MY STRENGTH I HAD REINVIGORATED HIS HALTING COURAGE
HE WOULD APE MADNESS LIKE BARNES OR ARM HIMSELF WITH A CARVING-KNIFE LIKE TALLOWAX OR SWEAR THAT THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE LAW AS EXORS WAS DISPOSED TO DO
THEN AS I WAS ABOUT TO DEPART FROM THE DOOR OF GRAYBODY'S HOUSE I WHISPERED TO MYSELF AGAIN THE NAMES OF GALILEO AND COLUMBUS
HE HAD COME AS I SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT I REALLY WENT
THE TEACHERS OF RELIGION HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO RECONCILE US TO IT AND HAVE IN THEIR VAIN ZEAL ENDEAVOURED TO EFFECT IT BY PICTURING TO OUR IMAGINATIONS A HELL-FIRE INTO WHICH NINETY-NINE MUST FALL
MRS NEVERBEND SWORE A SOLEMN OATH THAT JACK SHOULD BE MADE TO ABANDON HIS CRICKET
I FELT AT THE MOMENT A GREAT LOVE FOR HIM,--AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE ADMIRATION BECAUSE HE HAD SO FAR CONQUERED HIS FEAR OF AN UNKNOWN FUTURE AS TO PROMISE TO DO THIS THING SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO IT
IT WAS ABSURD TO SEE JACK AS HE WAS CARRIED BACK TO GLADSTONOPOLIS AS THE HERO OF THE OCCASION AND TO HEAR HIM AS HE MADE HIS SPEECHES AT THE DINNER WHICH WAS GIVEN ON THE DAY AND AT WHICH HE WAS CALLED UPON TO TAKE THE CHAIR
WHY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS JOSHUA COMMANDED TO SLAY MIGHTY KINGS
BUT ON THE WHOLE WE ARE A PROSPEROUS AND WELL-SATISFIED PEOPLE WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SAID MY WIFE
HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN THAT ATTEMPT
HAVE YOU NO LOVE OF COUNTRY NO PATRIOTISM NO FEELING AT ANY RATE OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE WORLD'S WELFARE BY YOUR OWN FAMILY I OWN I DID FEEL VEXED WHEN SHE SPOKE OF EVA AS HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE CONTAMINATED BY BEING A BRITANNULIST BECAUSE OF THE LAW ENACTING THE FIXED PERIOD
IT HAS BEEN MY LOT IN LIFE TO SERVE MY SOVEREIGN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AND HUMBLY TO REPRESENT THE THRONE OF ENGLAND IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE
HAD NOT THE JOHN BRIGHT STEAMED INTO YOUR HARBOUR YESTERDAY ONE OF YOUR MOST VALUED CITIZENS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY--DEPOSITED WHEN HE HAD SO SPOKEN HE TURNED ROUND TO MR CRASWELLER WHO WAS SITTING ON MY RIGHT HAND AND BOWED TO HIM
I MYSELF HAD GONE MOST CLOSELY INTO THE QUESTION OF EXPENSE AND HAD FOUND THAT BY THE USE OF MACHINERY THE COLLEGE COULD ALMOST BE MADE SELF-SUPPORTING
BUT IF WE MUST LIVE IN A SHIP WE ARE NOT SO BAD HERE
HAD IT INDEED BEEN REALLY STRONG WITH ANY BUT MYSELF
BUT FOR THOSE UNTOLD GENERATIONS TO COME WHOSE LIVES MAY BE MODELLED FOR THEM UNDER THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT A CERTAIN FIXED PERIOD THEY SHALL DEPART HENCE WITH ALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF HONOUR AND GLORY
MEN ARE NOT EXECUTED IN BRITANNULA
WE DO NOT WISH TO MAKE OURSELVES DISAGREEABLE TO YOU MR NEVERBEND I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY IS THE EVIL THEREOF AND NOW GENTLEMEN I HAVE TO REQUEST YOUR ATTENTION FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO ANOTHER MATTER AND ONE WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS WHICH WE HAVE DISCUSSED
I WAS INFORMED THAT I WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE THE PRESIDENT'S SEAT EVERY DAY
IT IS PRETTY COMFORTABLE HE WAS EVIDENTLY MELANCHOLY AND KNEW THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I HAD COME
BUT TO MY EYES AS WE PROGRESSED IT BECAME NEARER TILL AT LAST THE HULL OF THE VAST VESSEL BECAME MANIFEST
THE GUN MAY BE THERE ALL RIGHT AND THE GUNPOWDER AND THE TWENTY TONS OF IRON SHOT
AT THE VERY MOMENT AT WHICH I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH RUGGLES IN THE STREET ON THE SUBJECT A MEETING HAD BEEN HELD IN THE MARKET-PLACE WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUTTING DOWN THE FIXED PERIOD
ON THE NEXT MORNING SIR FERDINANDO BROWN AND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX WERE ANNOUNCED AT THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAD BEEN OUTSIDE HIS OWN GROUNDS ONCE DURING THESE SIX WEEKS
THERE WAS NOT A VACANT CORNER TO BE FOUND
WHEN THE HAND OF GOD IS FELT TO HAVE STRUCK ONE WITH COMING DEATH THE SUFFERER KNOWING THE BLOW TO BE INEVITABLE CAN RECONCILE HIMSELF
IT WAS A PART OF THE DIFFICULTY WHICH AS A GREAT REFORMER I MUST ENDURE
BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN A GREATER CROWD THAN WAS COLLECTED THERE ON THIS OCCASION
IT WAS AT PRESENT PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH EUCALYPTI AND ILEXES--THE GUM-TREES FOR THE PRESENT GENERATION AND THE GREEN-OAKS FOR THOSE TO COME
AND THAT IN OPPOSITION TO THE WISHES AS I UNDERSTAND OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF YOUR FELLOW-CITIZENS THE WISHES OF OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS HAVE BEEN DECLARED BY REPEATED MAJORITIES IN THE ASSEMBLY YOU HAVE ONLY ONE HOUSE IN YOUR CONSTITUTION SAID SIR FERDINANDO
WE HAD ADVANCED A STEP UPWARDS AND HAD ADOPTED THE FIXED PERIOD
THE RECORDS ARE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID
CRASWELLER SAID I DO YOU MIND COMING INTO THE HOUSE AND HAVING A LITTLE CHAT AND SO I GOT OFF MY TRICYCLE
WE HAVE HAD THREE OR FOUR WATER TELEGRAMS FROM THEM SINCE THEY STARTED AND THEY HADN'T THEN LOST TEN MINUTES ON THE JOURNEY
IT IS THE SAME WITH AN OLD MAN
HOW ARE A PEOPLE TO THRIVE WHEN SO WEIGHTED
IT INCLUDES THAT KIND OF RELATION BETWEEN A PARENT AND HIS SON WITHOUT WHICH LIFE WOULD BE A BURDEN TO ME AND I SHOULD THINK VERY GRIEVOUS TO YOU ALSO OF COURSE I HOPE THAT YOU AND I MAY ALWAYS BE ON GOOD TERMS I WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE THIS ADMISSION FOR WHAT IT WAS WORTH
SHE ALREADY REGARDS ME AS THOUGH I WERE A VISITANT FROM THE OTHER WORLD
AND THE DESIRE OF PUBLISHING A BOOK IN WHICH I SHOULD DECLARE MY THEORY,--THIS VERY BOOK WHICH I HAVE SO NEARLY BROUGHT TO A CLOSE,--MADE ME DESIRE TO GO
WHAT CAN THEY HAVE TO SAY TO ME I REPLIED WITH ALL THE DIGNITY I COULD COMMAND
HE WAS STILL IN THEORY A SUPPORTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD,--PLEADING HIS OWN LITTLE CAUSE HOWEVER BY A DIRECT FALSEHOOD
THEY TRIED THEIR CATAPULT WITH SINGLE DOUBLE AND EVEN TREBLE ACTION
I RETURNED HIS GREETING WITH MY PLEASANTEST SMILE
I HAVE TO ENDEAVOUR TO THINK HOW CRASWELLER'S MIND MAY BE AFFECTED RATHER THAN MY OWN
AND ALL THE PUDDLEBRANES WERE ALWAYS BURIED
IN THAT CASE HE WILL BLOW US ALL INTO ATOMS THEN SIR FERDINANDO ROSE TO HIS LEGS AND BEGAN HIS SPEECH
CRASWELLER WALKED BY AS I TOOK MY PLACE BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND WAS SILENT
YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD HERE I BOWED TO HIM
TO SO SMALL AN ENGLISH-SPEAKING COMMUNITY HAS THIS NEVER BEFORE BEEN GRANTED
AND IT WAS IN THOSE DAYS THAT THE CALCULATION WAS MADE AS TO THE RIVERS AND RAILWAYS
JACK AGAIN SET HIS BALL SNAP WENT THE MACHINE AND STUMPS WRIGGLED HIS BAT
AND WHAT ARE YOU ALL GOING TO TALK ABOUT THERE THERE IS ONLY ONE SUBJECT SAID JACK WHICH AT PRESENT OCCUPIES THE MIND OF GLADSTONOPOLIS
ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY I WILL TAKE UPON MYSELF THOUGH THE HONOUR AND GLORY I MUST SHARE WITH MY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN
AS TO THE MINISTER FOR THE CROWN COLONIES,--OF WHICH ALAS
BELIEVE ME THAT MAN IS NOT SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH EFFORTS HE WOULD GET USED TO IT
AND UP TO THAT MOMENT WHEN THE LIEUTENANT MET US AT THE TOP OF THE HILL SHE WAS ALWAYS AS COLD AS SNOW AND NOW THE SNOW IS MELTED YES,--THAT IS TO SAY IT IS BEGINNING TO THAW AS HE SAID THIS I REMEMBERED THE KISS BEHIND THE PARLOUR-DOOR WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER BY ANOTHER SUITOR BEFORE THESE TROUBLES BEGAN AND MY IMPRESSION THAT JACK HAD SEEN IT ALSO
THERE IS NO FALSEHOOD INTENDED THEN THERE NEED BE NO BARGAIN AS TO EVA AND NO NEED FOR DISCUSSING THE FLOCKS AND HERDS ON THIS OCCASION
IT IS YOUR OWN PRIDE,--YOUR VANITY AND CRUELTY COMBINED
HE'S THE MOST UNMEANING UPSTART OF A PUPPY I EVER MET
BUT NOW AS THE TIME GREW NEARER I COULD NOT BUT SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO ENFORCE THE LAW AGAINST WELL-KNOWN MEN AND HOW EASY TO ALLOW THE WOMEN TO ESCAPE BY THE HELP OF FALSEHOOD
EVA CRASWELLER WAS I THINK THE MOST PERFECT PIECE I EVER BEHELD OF YOUTHFUL FEMININE BEAUTY
THE VERY FACILITY WHICH HAD EXISTED FOR THE PASSING OF THE LAW THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO CARRY OUT THE LAW
THEN I THINK I MAY ASSUME THAT CAPTAIN BATTLEAX WILL NOT FIRE HIS GUN
WHEN THAT WAS OVER I WAS TOLD THAT EVA WAS IN MY STUDY WAITING TO SEE ME
BUT I AM STILL AS ENERGETIC AS EVER AND AS ASSURED THAT THE DOCTRINE WILL ULTIMATELY PREVAIL OVER THE FACE OF THE CIVILISED WORLD THOUGH I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MEN ARE NOT AS YET RIPE FOR IT
AND IT WAS NECESSARY OF COURSE THAT OUR BOYS SHOULD BE EQUALLY WELL SERVED
HE NEVER CARED A STRAW FOR ME
HE WAS AN OLDER MAN BY TEN YEARS THAN EITHER OF HIS PARTNERS BUT YET GRUNDLE'S ELDEST SON ABRAHAM WAS OLDER THAN EVA WHEN CRASWELLER LENT HIS MONEY TO THE FIRM
THE UNITED STATES HAVE MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT
IT IS SAD TO THINK THAT THE STRENGTH AND INTELLECT AND SPIRIT OF MANHOOD SHOULD THUS BE CONQUERED BY THAT VERY IMBECILITY WHICH IT IS THEIR DESIRE TO BANISH FROM THE WORLD
BUT ONLY IN VAIN IN REGARD TO THE FEELINGS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAN HIMSELF
IT IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR THAT YOUNG FELLOW GRUNDLE WHO IS SO ANXIOUS TO STEP INTO MY SHOES MY DEAR CRASWELLER I REJOINED IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO TO ARRANGE THE LAW AS TO VARY THE TERM TO SUIT THE PECULIARITIES OF ONE MAN OR ANOTHER BUT IN A CHANGE OF SUCH TERRIBLE SEVERITY YOU SHOULD HAVE SUITED THE ELDEST THIS WAS DREADFUL TO ME,--THAT HE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE AT THE HANDS OF HIS COUNTRY THE GREAT HONOUR INTENDED FOR HIM,--THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY ALLOWED HIS MIND TO HAVE REBELLED AGAINST IT
YOU MR NEVERBEND WILL ALWAYS BE REGARDED AS THE FATHER OF YOUR COUNTRY ROMA PATREM PATRIAE CICERONEM LIBERA DIXIT WITH THIS THE TWO GENTLEMEN LEFT THE ROOM
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OUR EFFORTS TO LIVE ALONE DURING THE THIRTY YEARS THAT WE REMAINED OUR OWN MASTERS
AND I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD IF YOU ONLY TAKE YOUR MEALS REGULAR
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU
AND YET HE HAD NOT BEFORE COME ON SHORE TO VISIT ME NOR HAD HE MADE ONE AT OUR LITTLE DINNER-PARTY
BUT HE DID LIVE ALTHOUGH HE NEVER ONCE TOUCHED THE BALL
WHEN THINGS HAPPEN VERY ODDLY AS YOU CALL IT THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PREMEDITATED NOT THEIR COMING TO-DAY
TELLS ME THAT JEMIMA IS GOING BECAUSE NONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WILL COME UP AND SEE HER THIS WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY BUT A SMALL ONE AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT SHOULD BE OVERCOME
THOSE AGED MEN WHO WERE AWAITING AS I VERILY BELIEVE IN IMPATIENCE THE COMING DAY OF THEIR PERFECTED DIGNITY HAVE BEEN TURNED LOOSE IN THE WORLD AND ALLOWED TO GROVEL AGAIN WITH MUNDANE THOUGHTS AMIDST THE IDLENESS OF YEARS THAT ARE USELESS
MY BELIEF IS THAT HE WOULD HAVE SWORN AGAINST HIS OWN FATHER PERJURED HIMSELF IN THE VERY TEETH OF TRUTH TO HAVE OBTAINED FROM EVA THAT LITTLE PRIVILEGE WHICH I HAD ONCE SEEN GRUNDLE ENJOYING
BUT I COULD PERCEIVE THAT THESE CARRIAGES WERE FILLED FOR THE MOST PART BY YOUNG MEN AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONTEMPORARY OF CRASWELLER TO BE SEEN AT ALL
THIS HAD MADE JACK MORE THAN EVER INTENT ON BEATING SIR KENNINGTON BUT HAD NOT AS YET HAD THE EFFECT WHICH EVA HAD INTENDED
MY NAME WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN TO POSTERITY WITH THOSE OF COLUMBUS AND GALILEO AND BRITANNULA WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTED AS THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH INSTEAD OF HAVING BECOME A BY-WORD AMONG COUNTRIES AS A DEPRIVED REPUBLIC AND REANNEXED CROWN COLONY
LOOK BACK UPON ALL THE CENTURIES AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT LIFE HAS EVER BEEN DEAR TO THE BEST OF MEN
EVA I SAID WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR OF A PUBLIC MEETING IN THE STREETS OH MR NEVERBEND SHE SAID TAKING ME BY THE ARM THERE ARE ONLY A FEW BOYS WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT PAPA THROUGH ALL THE NOISES AND TUMULTS OF THESE TIMES THERE WAS AN EVIDENT DETERMINATION TO SPEAK OF JACK AS A BOY
BUT THERE ARE REFORMS SO GREAT THAT A MAN CANNOT BUT BE ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN HE HAS RECEIVED INTO HIS VERY SOUL THE TRUTH OF ANY HUMAN IMPROVEMENT
WE WERE TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT THIS WAS DONE AT EVA'S DIRECTIONS BECAUSE OLD CRASWELLER WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE BOY IN HIS HOUSE SEEING THAT HE COULD NOT IN HIS PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES RECEIVE ME OR MY WIFE
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A MAN WAS MURDERED WHEN HE IS--IS--KILLED IN BATTLE I HAD BEEN ABOUT TO SAY EXECUTED BUT I STOPPED MYSELF
THAT NIGHT I RECEIVED SUCH A LECTURE FROM MRS NEVERBEND IN OUR BEDROOM AS MIGHT HAVE SHAMED THAT MRS CAUDLE OF WHOM WE READ IN ENGLISH HISTORY
MY WIFE DECLARED THAT ALL THAT WAS ALTERED,--THAT JACK WAS IN FACT A MUCH MORE MANLY FELLOW THAN ABRAHAM WITH HIS SHINY BIT OF BEARD
BUT AS THINGS ARE I CAN NEVER MARRY HIM IF PAPA IS TO BE SHUT UP IN THAT WRETCHED CITY OF THE DEAD NOT CITY OF THE DEAD MY DEAR OH I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF IT!--ALL ALONE WITH NO ONE BUT ME WITH HIM TO WATCH HIM AS DAY AFTER DAY PASSES AWAY AS THE GHASTLY HOUR COMES NEARER AND STILL NEARER WHEN HE IS TO BE BURNED IN THOSE FEARFUL FURNACES THE CREMATION MY DEAR HAS NOTHING IN TRUTH TO DO WITH THE FIXED PERIOD TO WAIT TILL THE FATAL DAY SHALL HAVE ARRIVED AND THEN TO KNOW THAT AT A FIXED HOUR HE WILL BE DESTROYED JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID SO
AND A GREATER BABEL OF VOICES WAS I'LL UNDERTAKE TO SAY NEVER HEARD FROM A BANQUETING-HALL THAN CAME FROM OUR DINNER-TABLE
I CAN TELL YOU THAT
I HAD NOT THEN THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD BE A RECREANT OR THAT HE WOULD BE DETERRED BY THE FEAR OF DEPARTURE FROM ENJOYING THE HONOURS WHICH WOULD BE PAID TO HIM
YOUR GOVERNOR HAS TOLD YOU THAT HE IS AWARE OF ALL THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH THE FIXED PERIOD IS MAINTAINED
HE HAD IMPORTED PHEASANTS EGGS AND SALMON-SPAWN AND YOUNG DEER AND BLACK-COCK AND GROUSE AND THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ALDERNEY COWS NO BIGGER THAN GOOD-SIZED DOGS WHICH WHEN MILKED GIVE NOTHING BUT CREAM
I TURNED MY FACE TOWARDS IT AND GAZED AND THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK ME
THE SPACES REQUIRED BY THE CRICKETERS WERE SO ENORMOUS THAT OTHERWISE THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING OF THE PLAY
IT WAS IN THAT THAT LAY THE AGONY OF THE BLOW
THERE ARE MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS DRY TOAST BUTTERED TOAST PLUM-CAKE SEED-CAKE PEACH-FRITTERS APPLE-MARMALADE AND BREAD AND BUTTER
THIS MR CRASWELLER IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO PAY HIM
AND THERE SHE WAS WITH HIM FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
BUT HE HAD NO SON
WOULD THEY MEET ME THERE IN THAT HALL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND HEAR THE LAST WORDS WHICH I SHOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS TO THEM
OH EVA IS HE NOT HANDSOME SAID HIS MOTHER IN ECSTASY HANGING ACROSS MY CHAIR
BUT EACH SLAVE REQUIRED AS MUCH LOOKING AFTER AS DID THE MASTERS AND THEY THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL MORE OF THEMSELVES THAN DID THE NON-PROFESSIONALS
WHEN I WOKE IN THE MORNING BEFORE I COULD FACE THE LIGHT OF DAY IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD FORTIFY MYSELF WITH COLUMBUS AND GALILEO
BUT THERE CAME ON ME A DAY OF SUCCESS,--A DAY SHALL I SAY OF GLORY OR OF WRETCHEDNESS
I WAS IN TRUTH WRONG TO THINK THAT SO GREAT A REFORM COULD BE BROUGHT TO PERFECTION WITHIN THE DAYS OF THE FIRST REFORMERS
THEN I WIPED MY EYES AND WENT FORTH TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORROW
WHAT SHEEP WILL GO INTO UNSAVOURY PASTURES WITH NO HOPES BUT SUCH AS THESE HELD OUT TO THEM
I WEPT TO THINK THAT A SPIRIT OF HONESTY SHOULD AS YET HAVE PREVAILED SO LITTLE IN THE WORLD
AS FOR JACK I WILL NOT HAVE HIM ATTEND ANY SUCH MEETING
I DO NOT KNOW THE GENTLEMAN,--EXCEPT AS HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIM AT YOUR HOSPITABLE TABLE
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THAT FIFTY TIMES AND HAVE ALWAYS ARRIVED AT THE SAME CONCLUSION HE SAT STILL SILENT UNHAPPY AND CONFUSED
BUT IT WAS A HARD TASK THAT OF HAVING TO PRESS HIM UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
IT WAS FOR THAT THAT I WEPT
HE WOULD BE DEPOSITED AGAIN AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH IN TRIUMPH AND THE COLLEGE WOULD BE LEFT A WRECK BEHIND HIM THIS VIEW OF THE CASE WAS PECULIARLY DISTRESSING TO ME
WHY THE ENGLISH SIXTEEN ARE COMING HERE ON PURPOSE TO PLAY US AND SWEAR THAT THEY'LL BEAT US BY MEANS OF THE NEW CATAPULT
HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN EXPLAINING HOW IN THE OLD TIMES MORE THAN SIX AT A TIME WERE NEVER SCORED
WHAT HAS MADE ME HATE THE FIXED PERIOD WORSE THAN ANYTHING IS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF YOUR VICTUALS
IF HE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN SO KEEN A SUPPORTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD NOW TURNED ROUND AND OPPOSED IT HOW COULD OTHERS WHO SHOULD FOLLOW BE EXPECTED TO YIELD THEMSELVES UP IN A FITTING FRAME OF MIND
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID ONE OF THE THREE WHOM I AFTERWARDS LEARNED TO BE THE SECOND LIEUTENANT
I HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF HUMAN NATURE TO UNDERSTAND ITS WEAKNESS IN THIS RESPECT
I DID NOT AFTER THAT FEEL SO STRONG A DISLIKE TO THE MAN AS I HAD DONE BEFORE
GOVERNMENT IN SENDING HIM TO BRITANNULA AND IN REQUESTING THE INHABITANTS TO REVERT TO THEIR OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT REQUEST INDEED I SAID TO CRASWELLER THROWING ALL POSSIBLE SCORN INTO THE TONE OF MY VOICE,--"REQUEST
AND THOUGH HE HAD FOR THE HOUR BEFORE BEEN VERY SEDULOUS IN MANIPULATING CERTAIN NOTES HE NOW WAS CAREFUL TO SHOW NOT A SCRAP OF PAPER
STORIES WERE TOLD TO ME BY THE JUNIOR OFFICERS OF MARVELLOUS THINGS WHICH HE HAD DONE WHICH THOUGH NEVER MENTIONED IN HIS OWN PRESENCE EITHER BY HIMSELF OR BY OTHERS SEEMED TO CONSTITUTE FOR HIM A SPECIAL CHARACTER,--SO THAT HAD IT BEEN NECESSARY THAT ANY ONE SHOULD JUMP OVERBOARD TO ATTACK A SHARK ALL ON BOARD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE DUTY AS A MATTER OF COURSE BELONGED TO LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES
I HAD ALREADY OVERCOME IN THE BREASTS OF MANY LISTENERS THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH I NOW MYSELF EXPERIENCED
I DON'T BELIEVE CONTINUED THE BOY BRINGING THE CONVERSATION TO AN END THAT ALL THE MEN IN THIS SHIP COULD TAKE MY GRANDFATHER AND KILL HIM IN COLD BLOOD I WAS SOMEWHAT ANNOYED ON MY WAY TO ENGLAND BY FINDING THAT THE MEN ON BOARD,--THE SAILORS THE STOKERS AND STEWARDS,--REGARDED ME AS A MOST CRUEL PERSON
AND IT WAS CONCLUSIVELY SHOWN THAT IN A VERY GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES LIFE BEYOND SIXTY-EIGHT WAS ALL VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
THIS I ALMOST DID
AS FAR AS THE LAW WENT IT WAS ADOPTED IN BRITANNULA
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO FEEL THAT THEY WERE MY ENEMIES AS I WAS SURE THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO OPPOSE THE CHERISHED CONVICTION OF MY VERY HEART AND SOUL
BUT I HAD FORGOT THAT THE DEPOSITED MUST COME FIRST
I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T LET US DEPOSIT ANY ONE THUS THEIR SECRET WAS DECLARED
HE BEAT THEM ALL THERE I COULD PERCEIVE THAT EVA WAS QUITE AS INTENT UPON CRICKET AS WAS HER LOVER AND PROBABLY THOUGHT JUST AS LITTLE ABOUT THE BUSINESS
AND AS TO PUTTING AN END TO HIM YOU MUST I THINK BE IGNORANT OF THE METHOD PROPOSED FOR ADDING HONOUR AND GLORY TO THE LAST MOMENTS IN THIS WORLD OF THOSE DEAR FRIENDS WHOSE HAPPY LOT IT WILL BE TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WORLD'S TROUBLES AMIDST THE LOVE AND VENERATION OF THEIR FELLOW-SUBJECTS AS TO THE ACTUAL MODE OF TRANSITION THERE HAD BEEN MANY DISCUSSIONS HELD BY THE EXECUTIVE IN PRESIDENT SQUARE AND IT HAD AT LAST BEEN DECIDED THAT CERTAIN VEINS SHOULD BE OPENED WHILE THE DEPARTING ONE SHOULD UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MORPHINE BE GENTLY ENTRANCED WITHIN A WARM BATH
BUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CONSTITUTION I HEARD IT ALL FROM THE CHAIR WHICH I USUALLY OCCUPIED AT THE SPEAKER'S RIGHT HAND
ON THE OCCASION OF THIS MY FIRST DAY ON BOARD HE HAD A DINNER-PARTY IN HONOUR OF MY COMING AMONG THEM
AND WHAT WAS THE UPSHOT OF WHAT HE HAD SAID
BUT I MAINTAIN THAT AS WE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SEPARATE OURSELVES AND STAND ALONE IT WAS NO MORE THEIR CONCERN THAN IF IT HAD BEEN DONE IN ARIZONA OR IDAHO OR ANY OF THOSE WESTERN STATES OF AMERICA WHICH HAVE LATELY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A NEW UNION
EVA ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIM AS A KIND OF YOUNGER BROTHER
THE ARGUMENTS ON WHICH THE GREATEST STRESS WAS LAID TENDED TO SHOW THAT THE FIXED PERIOD HAD BEEN CARRIED CHIEFLY WITH A VIEW TO RELIEVING THE MISERIES OF THE OLD
AS SOON AS A RESIDENCE AT THE COLLEGE WAS COMPLETED I ASKED HIM TO FILL IT
I HAVE AT ANY RATE TWO YEARS LEFT OF MY OUT-OF-DOOR EXISTENCE AND I DO NOT MEAN TO GIVE UP A DAY OF IT FOR GRUNDLE OR ANY ONE ELSE IT WAS SOMETHING TO SEE THAT HE STILL RECOGNISED THE LAW THOUGH HE WAS SO MEANLY ANXIOUS TO EVADE IT
BUT WHEN I WAS REMINDED OF THIS BY JACK A FEW DAYS LATER IT HAD QUITE GONE OUT OF MY HEAD
I ASSISTED VERY MANY IN THEIR WALKS OF LIFE
OR INDEED TO ALLAY THE NATURAL FEARS OF MOTHERS NOT WITH THOSE WHO SHOULD BE BORN FOR THE NEXT DOZEN YEARS
MR EXORS IS PREPARED TO DISPUTE IT AND SAYS THAT HE WILL ASK PERMISSION TO ARGUE THE CASE OUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE HE WOULD ARGUE ABOUT ANYTHING
YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH PAPA BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE UP LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND TO LEAVE THE PRETTY PLACE WHICH HE HAS MADE HIMSELF AND TO GO INTO THE COLLEGE,--AND BE KILLED I COULD NOT QUITE ANSWER HER AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE IN TRUTH I WAS SOMEWHAT ANGRY WITH HIM
ON THE FRIDAY AT TWO O'CLOCK THE VESSEL SAILED AMIDST ALL THE PLAUDITS WHICH COULD BE GIVEN BY MINGLED KETTLE-DRUMS AND TRUMPETS AND BY A SALVO OF ARTILLERY
IT HAS BECOME QUITE THE COMMON REPORT IN GLADSTONOPOLIS THAT JACK IS TO BECOME AT ONCE THE OWNER OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH PERISH LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH I EXCLAIMED
I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF THE WORDS WHICH LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES HAD SPOKEN TO ME
YOUNG MEN DON'T MATTER ALLOW ME TO ASSURE YOU MR CROSSTREES SAID I THAT YOUR SENTIMENT IS CARRYING YOU FAR AWAY FROM REASON
EVA ALREADY DOES NOT ABOVE HALF LIKE HIM
BUT YOU WILL HARDLY FIND ANOTHER WHO WILL NOT SUCCUMB
A DOZEN DIFFERENT CLAUSES HAD BEEN CARRIED EACH REFERRING TO VARIOUS BRANCHES OF THE QUESTION
I WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DECLARE THAT NOT A MAN OR A WOMAN IN BRITANNULA WAS IN DOUBT AS TO MR CRASWELLER'S EXACT AGE
HE WAS TO TAKE THE FOUR FIRST BALLS MAKING BUT ONE RUN OFF THE LAST AND THEN BEGINNING ANOTHER OVER AT THE OPPOSITE END DO THE SAME THING AGAIN
SO THE TIME PASSED ON AND THE DAY ABSOLUTELY CAME ON WHICH CRASWELLER WAS TO BE DEPOSITED
THERE WERE ALDERMEN IN GLADSTONOPOLIS AND MAGISTRATES IN THE COUNTRY WHOSE DUTY IT WOULD NO DOUBT BE TO SEE THAT THE LAW WAS CARRIED OUT
AND I AM NOT BY NATURE HARD-HEARTED
WELL AS YOU ALL LOVE THE FIXED PERIOD IT MUST BE DELAYED TILL SIR FERDINANDO AND THE ENGLISH HAVE--BEEN CONVERTED NEVER NEVER SHOUTED SIR FERDINANDO
HE THINKS BECAUSE HE HAS GOT AN UNMEANING HANDLE TO HIS NAME THAT EVERYBODY IS TO COME TO HIS WHISTLE
THAT HAS NOT BEEN PREMEDITATED
PROBABLY ON SUCH OCCASIONS THE MAJORITY OF THE WORDS SPOKEN HAD COME FROM MY OWN MOUTH
I COMMAND HIM TO START FOR NEW ZEALAND THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW AND I SHALL SEE WHETHER HE WILL OBEY ME
BUT I SHOULD BE WILLING TO ABANDON A YEAR IF I COULD MAKE THINGS RUN SMOOTH BY DOING SO
THAT WAS THE ACCUSATION GENERALLY MADE AGAINST HIM IN GLADSTONOPOLIS
AND AS THIS ISLAND HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND A PART OF IT CULTIVATED THITHER WE DETERMINED TO GO
HE BOWED MOST GRACEFULLY TO EVA WHO WAS SO STIRRED BY EMOTION THAT SHE COULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO SPEAK A WORD
AND MR EXORS THE LAWYER IS SPREADING IT ABOUT
IF YOU KNEW HOW I HATE THAT MR GRUNDLE
IT'S OVAL'S HEAD THAT IS TURNED CONTINUED HIS LORDSHIP
BUT TO ME THE QUESTION IS ONE OF SOME MOMENT
JACK IN HIS PASSION BROKE THE HANDLE OF HIS SPRING-BAT AND THEN HAD HALF-A-DOZEN BROUGHT TO HIM IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CHOOSE ANOTHER
I WILL NOT LIE
THE UNKNOWN FUTURE IS ALWAYS AWFUL
THINK OF IT HE CONTINUED
KNOWING THE GREAT GOODNESS OF THE ALMIGHTY SHOULD WE NOT BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT AS A CHANGE PROBABLY FOR THE BETTER
I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SIT MERELY TO REGISTER THE EDICTS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND BE TOLD THAT WE'RE A PACK OF FOOLS WHEN WE HESITATE I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS THE UNFORTUNATE DESTINY OF A HOUSE OF LORDS TO BE MADE TO SEE HER OWN UNFITNESS FOR LEGISLATIVE WORK
ABRAHAM WAS A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BRIGHT EYES AND A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MOUSTACHE
CHAPTER IX
MY WIFE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND,--CRASWELLER COULD NOT UNDERSTAND,--HOW STRONG MAY BE THE PASSION FOUNDED ON THE CONVICTION OF A LIFE
AND IF THIS KIND OF THING WENT ON IT MIGHT BE THAT I SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO QUARREL WITH HIM ALTOGETHER AND TO HAVE HIM PUNISHED UNDER THE LAW LIKE SOME OLD ROMAN OF OLD
A WILLING OBEDIENCE WAS ESPECIALLY DESIRED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND A WILLING OBEDIENCE I HAD EXPECTED FROM MY FRIEND CRASWELLER
THE FIRST BREAK-DOWN
THE FIRST BREAK-DOWN
THE CRICKETING ENGLISHMEN I KNEW WERE GOING
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT WHEN ALMOST DESPAIRING THEY HAD BEEN COMFORTED BY AN INNER TRUTH AND HAD BEEN ALL BUT INSPIRED TO TRUST WITH CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CAUSE
WE SEPARATED FROM THE OLD MOTHER COUNTRY WITH NO QUARREL WITH NO ILL-WILL
WHAT WOULD THAT GUARD OF SOLDIERS HAVE DONE SUPPOSING THAT I HAD RUN AWAY WE SHOULD HAVE HAD TO WAIT TILL THEY HAD CAUGHT YOU
I TRUST THAT I MAY YET LIVE TO RETURN AMONG YOU AND TO RENDER YOU AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR YOU AND FOR THE CAUSE IN EUROPE HERE I SAT DOWN AND WAS GREETED BY THE DEAFENING APPLAUSE OF THE AUDIENCE
HE IS VERY SORRY TO BE SO UNCEREMONIOUS BUT THE 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF CARE LAID ON I SUGGESTED
ORIGINALLY NO DOUBT
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AT LAST THAT HE FORCED HIMSELF INTO ABNORMAL SPRIGHTLINESS WITH A VIEW OF BRINGING DISGRACE UPON THE LAW OF THE FIXED PERIOD
EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND A-YEAR AT THE LEAST
THE PASTURE HAD BEEN THE BEST WHICH THE INGENUITY OF MAN HAD FOUND FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SHEEP
MY DAUGHTER WILL HIDE HER FACE ON SUCH A DAY AS THIS
SIR FERDINANDO BROWN IS TO ME--SIMPLY SIR FERDINANDO BROWN SIR FERDINANDO HAS LATELY BEEN OUR BRITISH GOVERNOR IN ASHANTEE WHERE HE HAS AS I MAY TRULY SAY BOUGHT GOLDEN OPINIONS FROM ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE HE HAS NOW BEEN SENT HERE ON THIS DELICATE MISSION AND TO NO ONE COULD IT BE INTRUSTED BY WHOM IT WOULD BE PERFORMED WITH MORE SCRUPULOUS HONOUR THIS WAS SIMPLY THE OPINION OF CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND EXPRESSED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WHOM HE SO LAUDED
HE CAN'T MOVE AN INCH REPLIED THE OTHER
THEREFORE NECROPOLIS IT WAS CALLED
I COULD NOT BUT BE GRIEVED BECAUSE HE HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE LESS OF A MAN THAN I HAD EXPECTED
IT WAS FOR US TO MAKE OUR OWN LAWS AND WE HAD HITHERTO MADE THEM IN CONFORMITY WITH THE INSTITUTIONS AND I MUST SAY WITH THE PREJUDICES OF SO-CALLED CIVILISATION
BUT IF SO THEY HADN'T KNOWN JACK
EVEN LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES WOULD BE SEEN NO MORE AFTER I HAD GONE ASHORE
I CAME IN AND TOOK HIS LIMP HAND IN MINE AND CONGRATULATED HIM
BUT EVEN IN BRITANNULA FEAR STILL REMAINS
HE IS FIGHTING HIS COUNTRY'S BATTLE AND DIES GLORIOUSLY HE HAS HIS LEG SHOT OFF OR HIS ARM AND IS TOO FREQUENTLY LEFT TO PERISH MISERABLY ON THE GROUND
NOT BY ME
SHE WAS GONE NOW AND I FELT THAT SHE MUST SAY AND THINK EVIL THINGS OF ME THROUGH ALL MY FUTURE LIFE
AND AS THE MEN PUT THEIR OARS INTO THE WATER I JUMPED WITH A SUDDEN START AT THE SUDDEN EXPLOSION OF A SUBSIDIARY CANNON WHICH WENT ON FIRING SOME DOZENS OF TIMES TILL THE PROPER NUMBER HAD BEEN COMPLETED SUPPOSED TO BE DUE TO AN OFFICER OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
HE AT ONCE BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST MY OLD FRIEND FOR THE RECOVERY OF THAT PROPORTION OF HIS PROPERTY TO WHICH HE WAS HELD TO BE ENTITLED UNDER OUR MARRIAGE LAWS
WE RECEIVED INDEED A VIOLENT REMONSTRANCE FROM THE OLD-FASHIONED GOVERNMENT AT WASHINGTON
IT MIGHT PASS A LAW BUT THE LAW COULD BE CARRIED OUT ONLY BY MEN
IN MY VERY HEART I LOVED HIM QUITE AS WELL AS DID HIS MOTHER AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE FINEST YOUNG FELLOW THAT BRITANNULA HAD PRODUCED
BUT SUCH IS NOT THE NATURAL CONDITION OF A MAN
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME LIKE HIM BEST IS HIS GREAT AFFECTION FOR YOU
I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT SIR FERDINANDO GAVE HIMSELF UNNECESSARY TROUBLE IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROVE TO US THAT THE FIXED PERIOD IS A WICKED ARRANGEMENT
WHO WOULD DO MORE FOR YOU THAN I HAVE DONE
IT WOULD NOT HAVE SUITED
HE SPOKE ALWAYS CLEARLY AND AUDIBLY AND HE WAS KNOWN FOR THE FIRM VOICE WITH WHICH HE WOULD PERFORM OCCASIONALLY AT SOME OF OUR DECIMAL READINGS
THEY HOWEVER ARE NOT MEN OF GREAT WEIGHT IN BRITANNULA AND THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE CONSTRAINED THEM TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE WHICH CRASWELLER HAD SET
BUT A BRITANNULAN FATHER HAS A HEART IN HIS BOSOM WHICH IS MORE POWERFUL THAN LAW OR EVEN CUSTOM AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ROMAN WAS MUCH THE SAME
IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME WHETHER YOU ARE HERE OR NOT THEN I SHOOK MY HEAD BY WAY OF SHOWING HIM THAT I WOULD COME AND I TOOK MY LEAVE
MY LIFE IS TOO PRECIOUS IN THE ASSEMBLY JUST AT PRESENT HE SAID TO ME EXCUSING HIMSELF
BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT CONVICTIONS BECOME VAGUE WHEN THEY OPERATE AGAINST ONE'S SELF
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT BIG GUN IS EVEN LOADED THE MORE CONTEMPTIBLE IS HER POSITION
A MAN OUGHT NOT TO BE SO ANXIOUS TO KILL HIS BROTHER IF I COULD TAKE YOUR PLACE AS GOD WILL BE MY JUDGE I WOULD DO SO WITH AS READY A STEP AS A YOUNG MAN TO THE ARMS OF HIS BELOVED
TIME PASSED ON AND THE PRACTICE ON THE LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH GROUND WAS CONTINUED
OUR DEBATES EVEN ON THIS SUBJECT WERE LONG AND ANIMATED
BUT HE IS THE BEST FELLOW IN THE WORLD AND WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASK HIM BUT HE WAS OUT NOW
HE'S A VERY GOOD SLIP THOUGH HE DIDN'T CATCH JACK WHEN HE GOT A CHANCE
BUT AT TWO THE NEXT DAY JACK HAD BEEN PATCHED UP AND NOTHING COULD KEEP HIM FROM LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
THIS WOULD ALLOW ONLY TWENTY EACH TO THE OTHER THREE PLAYERS
AND IN TALKING OF THIS THE TERRIBLE WORD MURDER WAS BROUGHT INTO COMMON USE
HE WAS A BAR-KEEPER WITH A RED NOSE AND AS HE SPOKE HE TOOK UP A PLACE IN FRONT OF THE HORSES
AT ANY RATE MY ELOQUENCE WAS ALTOGETHER STOPPED
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW I ASKED
I WENT HOME TO MY HOUSE IN TRIUMPH
IT WAS AS THOUGH RUSSIA WERE TO TURN UPON THE UNITED STATES AND DECLARE THAT THEIR CONGRESS SHOULD BE PUT DOWN
WHY COULD I NOT RETURN TO MY WOOL-SHED AND BE CONTENTED AMONG MY BALES AND MY SHIPS AND MY CREDITS AS I WAS OF YORE BEFORE THIS THEORY TOOK TOTAL POSSESSION OF ME
IF YOU WISH TO REMAIN ON GOOD TERMS WITH ME SAID I YOU MUST NOT OPPOSE ME IN PUBLIC WHEN I AM ACTING AS A PUBLIC MAGISTRATE IS HE TO SEE MR CRASWELLER MURDERED BEFORE HIS VERY EYES AND TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT SAID MRS NEVERBEND
BE THAT AS IT MAY DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NOBODY WAS ABLE TO GET HIM OUT
THE IDEA WAS SO STRANGE TO THEM THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE THAT WE SHOULD CARRY IT OUT
AND WHAT HOPE HAD THERE BEEN WHAT REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED FAIR-PLAY
I DO NOT INTEND TO BE THWARTED BY YOU IN CARRYING ON THE GREAT REFORM TO WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED MY LIFE
AND TIDINGS SO MISREPRESENTING ME WOULD HAVE REACHED ENGLAND BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD THERE HAVE NO FRIEND
XII
HE WAS THE VERY MAN THE VERY FRIEND ON WHOM I HAD RELIED WITH CONFIDENCE
DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY JOURNEY TO ENGLAND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME ABOUT THE FIXED PERIOD
I HAD OF COURSE HEARD OF THIS HAIR TELEPHONE BUT I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN IT USED IN SUCH PERFECTION
AS THIS OCCURRED TO ME I LOOKED BACK TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND THERE FROM A LITTLE LATTICE WINDOW AT THE END OF THE VERANDAH I SAW A LADY'S HANDKERCHIEF WAVING
IT WAS MY FIRST ANXIETY TO GET RID OF THESE ENGLISHMEN BEFORE THE SUBJECT SHOULD BE AGAIN VENTILATED
I HAVE BEEN KIND AND PERHAPS TOO INDULGENT TO HIM
INDEED IN THAT RESPECT IT SIMPLY FOLLOWED THE LEAD GIVEN HER BY THE AUSTRALIAS WHICH WHEN THEY SET UP FOR THEMSELVES DID SO WITH THE FULL CO-OPERATION OF ENGLAND
BUT THEY HAD FOUND IN THEIR OWN HEARTS THAT ON WHICH THEY COULD RELY
AND TO MY THINKING HE IS MUCH MORE FIT TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY AS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD THAT I SAID TO HER AND WAS ONLY INTENT ON EXPRESSING THE WARMTH OF HER OWN FEELINGS I ALLOWED HER TO GO HER WAY AND RETIRED TO THE PRIVACY OF MY OWN LIBRARY
IT MUST BE EXPLAINED THAT OUR CLUB HAD NO PROFESSIONALS
YOU MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR IT
OH INDEED MY LORD SAID MRS NEVERBEND
AND WE WERE PULLED OFF TO THE YACHT
BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MYSELF IMMEDIATELY ON MY ARRIVAL
MRS NEVERBEND PURSED UP HER LIPS AND SAID NOTHING
IN ANSWER TO THIS I BADE HER HOLD HER TONGUE AND REMEMBER THAT IN BRITANNULA A PROMISE WAS ALWAYS HELD TO BE AS GOOD AS A BOND
HE TOUCHED HIS HAT AND ASKED ME VERY CIVILLY WHERE I WAS GOING
BUT AS I REMAINED SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS EVA HELD MY HAND IN HERS AND LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE WITH BESEECHING EYES
BUT I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SEEN SIGNS OF RELENTING ABOUT THE MAN,--SOME SYMPTOMS OF SADNESS WHICH SEEMED TO BESPEAK A YIELDING SPIRIT
I MYSELF SAW THE TWO BAILS FLY AWAY INTO INFINITE SPACE AND AT ONCE THERE WAS A SOUND OF KETTLE-DRUMS TRUMPETS FIFES AND CLARIONETS
HE KNEW IT TO BE UNTRUE
THEY TELL ME THAT HIS FATHER WAS MADE WHAT THEY CALL A BARONET BECAUSE HE SET A BROKEN ARM FOR ONE OF THOSE TWENTY ROYAL DUKES THAT ENGLAND HAS TO PAY FOR WHO HAS HAD TO COME TO HIS WHISTLE NOW ASKED HIS MOTHER
I MUST OWN THAT THOUGH I SHOULD CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE AFFRONTED IF I WERE TOLD THAT I WERE FAINT-HEARTED,--THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW MYSELF TO BE MALIGNED IF IT WERE SAID OF ME THAT I HAVE A COWARD'S FEAR OF DEATH,--STILL I SHOULD FEEL FAR FROM COMFORTABLE IF THAT AGE CAME UPON ME WHICH THIS SYSTEM HAS DEFINED AND WERE I TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH IT HAS PREVAILED
HE WOULDN'T ALLOW IT TO BE DONE BY ANYBODY ELSE IT WAS THUS THAT THEY REGARDED THE SACRIFICE THAT I HAD THOUGHT TO MAKE OF MY OWN FEELINGS IN REGARD TO CRASWELLER
IT IS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL THAT'S ONLY WHAT JACK SAYS
IS NOT THAT COURAGE
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OLD WOMEN ABOUT WHO ARE BEGINNING TO TELL TERRIBLE LIES ABOUT THEIR AGES
EXACTLY
IT WAS SOON KNOWN WHO WAS TO BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE EMPIRE
AT LEAST NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE
IF YOU WILL ONLY THINK OF THE MATTER ALL ROUND YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS ALL A FALSE SENTIMENT I SHOULD NOT LIKE IT SAID JACK WITH DETERMINATION
FOR THE ABSOLUTE CONDITION OF THE LAW YOU MUST LOOK IN THE STATUTE-BOOK AND NOT COME TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EMPIRE ABRAHAM GRUNDLE THEN DEPARTED
I BELIEVE THAT HE IS SO STILL ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME LITTLE HITCH AS TO THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH HE SHOULD BE DEPOSITED JUST TWELVE MONTHS HE SAYS OF COURSE I REPLIED THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE SURE TO BE THAT OF ONE YEAR
NECROPOLIS SOUNDED WELL THEY SAID AND ARGUED THAT THOUGH NO ACTUAL REMAINS OF THE BODY MIGHT BE LEFT THERE STILL THE TABLETS WOULD REMAIN
DO YOU ALLOW COFFEE TO YOUR CLUB;--COFFEE ASKED MACNUFFERY IN A VOICE MINGLING RIDICULE AND REPROOF WITH A TOUCH OF SATIRE AS HE HAD BEGUN TO GUESS THAT BOBBS HAD NOT BEEN LONG ATTENDING TO HIS PRESENT WORK
AND THOUGH HE COULD KISS EVA BEHIND THE DOOR AFTER THE WAYS OF YOUNG MEN STILL HE WAS MORE INTENT ON THE FLEECES THAN ON HER LIPS
IF SO WHY IS ALL EUROPE BRISTLING AT THIS MOMENT WITH ARMS,--PREPARED AS WE MUST SUPPOSE FOR SHORTENING LIFE,--AND WHY IS THERE A HANGMAN ATTACHED TO THE THRONE OF GREAT BRITAIN AS ONE OF ITS NECESSARY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
THIS TERRIBLE DOCTRINE HAS BEEN ADOPTED AT THE ADVICE OF AN ELOQUENT CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC WHO IS AT PRESENT ITS PRESIDENT AND WHOSE GENERAL POPULARITY SEEMS TO BE SO GREAT THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS VIEWS EVEN THIS MEASURE WILL BE CARRIED OUT UNLESS GREAT BRITAIN SHALL INTERFERE
I WAS INTENT ON SOMETHING OF INFINITELY GREATER IMPORTANCE
HE LINKED HIS ARM FAMILIARLY THROUGH MINE AND REMARKED THAT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE VERY LONG BEFORE THE COLLEGE RECEIVED ANY OF ITS INHABITANTS
NO ONE THOUGHT THERE THAT I WANTED TO EAT UP MY VICTIMS OR THAT I WOULD TAKE A PLEASURE IN SPILLING THEIR BLOOD WITH MY OWN HANDS
AND HE ENDED BY SAYING THAT THOUGH HE HAD AS A MATTER OF COURTESY AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ALACRITY PROPOSED MY HEALTH HE WOULD NOT CALL UPON ME FOR ANY REPLY
AND YET IT WAS NOT THAT I WAS ANGRY WITH THE CHILD
THERE ARE PUT-UP FRUITS OF ALL KINDS OF WHICH YOU REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HADN'T COME THIS MOMENT FROM GRAPERIES AND ORCHARD-HOUSES
THOUGH A DOZEN COMPANIONS MIGHT HAVE VISITED HIM DAILY HE WOULD HAVE FELT THE COLLEGE TO BE A SOLITUDE BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO CHOOSE HIS PROMISCUOUS COMRADES AS IN THE OUTER WORLD
SHOULD I NOT TAKE THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE OFFERED AND ALLOW JACK TO MARRY HIS WIFE AND BE HAPPY IN HIS OWN WAY
THE GRASSES WERE PECULIARLY RICH AND THE OLD ENGLISH FRUIT-TREES WHICH WE HAD BROUGHT WITH US FROM NEW ZEALAND THROVE THERE WITH AN EXUBERANT FERTILITY OF WHICH THE MOTHER COUNTRY I AM TOLD KNOWS NOTHING
EVA IS AT ANY RATE A GOOD GIRL TO ENDEAVOUR TO SAVE HER FATHER
THE BOAT HAD GONE ASHORE AND RETURNED BEFORE THE JOHN BRIGHT HAD STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
OF COURSE I TOLD HIM THAT ALL THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO NOTHING TO NOTHING
HAD I DARED TO REGARD MYSELF AS THE FOREMOST SPIRIT OF MY AGE AND SHOULD I THUS BE TURNED BACK BY THE HUMAN WEAKNESS OF ONE POOR CREATURE WHO HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY COLLECTED THE STRENGTH OF HIS HEART TO BE ABLE TO LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE AND TO LAUGH HIM DOWN
EVERY HOPE FOR WHICH I HAD LIVED AS I THEN TOLD MYSELF HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO SUDDEN EXTINCTION BY THE COMING OF THESE MEN TO WHOM I HAD BEEN SO PLEASANT AND WHO IN THEIR TURN HAD BEEN SO PLEASANT TO ME
YOU NEED TROUBLE YOURSELF NO LONGER ABOUT THE RECORDS
OF COURSE I MUST BE AT HOME TO RECEIVE THE MARQUIS OF MARYLEBONE ALL THIS SET ME THINKING ABOUT MANY THINGS
YOU WOULD HAVE THE IDEA THAT A KIND OF HONOUR WAS DONE TO YOUR PARENTS WHEN I KNEW THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO KILL HIM ON THE NEXT DAY HOW WOULD IT BE THEN YOU MIGHT RETIRE FOR A FEW HOURS TO YOUR THOUGHTS,--GOING INTO MOURNING AS IT WERE JACK SHOOK HIS HEAD
A SHIP CAN ONLY BE A SHIP AFTER ALL
IT IS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD TRAVEL AND SEE SOMETHING OF THE WORLD BEFORE YOU COMMENCE THE TRADE OF PUBLIC ORATOR
HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I EXCLAIMED IN MY ANGER
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO MR NEVERBEND SHE ASKED
YOU WILL NOT YIELD IN THIS MATTER TO ME YOUR FRIEND'S DAUGHTER BECAUSE YOUR VANITY TELLS YOU THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ONCE SAID A THING THAT THING SHALL COME TO PASS THEN SHE PUT THE VEIL DOWN OVER HER FACE AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
THERE WERE NOT ABOVE TEN AMONG US WHO HAD THEN REACHED ANY FIXED PERIOD
MY BOY IS DEAR TO ME AND EVA IS DEAR ALSO BUT NOT TO SAVE EVEN THEIR YOUNG LIVES COULD I CONSENT TO A FALSEHOOD IN THIS MATTER FALSEHOOD
I ONLY KNEW THAT THE DAY HAD COME THE TERRIBLE DAY FOR WHICH IN MY IGNORANCE I HAD YEARNED AND THAT I WAS TOTALLY UNABLE TO GO THROUGH ITS CEREMONIES WITH DIGNITY OR EVEN WITH COMPOSURE
A FEW ILL-SPOKEN WORDS SUCH AS THESE YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED WILL DO US MORE HARM IN THE MINDS OF MANY THAN ALL YOUR VOTING WILL HAVE DONE GOOD IN ANSWER TO THIS HE MERELY REPEATED HIS OBSERVATION THAT CRASWELLER WAS A VERY BAD SPECIMEN TO BEGIN WITH
IF I WERE SIMPLY THERE AND WERE SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF BRITANNULANS READY TO FIGHT FOR ME I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT MY PROMISE
YOU MAY BE SURE HE WILL NOT GIVE UP
I WILL SEE HIS FATE,--WHETHER IT BE HIS GLORY OR HIS FALL,"--SAID HIS MOTHER WITH TRUE ROMAN FEELING
IT WOULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE CAUSE TO SEE MY SPECIAL FRIEND CRASWELLER HAULED AWAY TO THE COLLEGE BY CONSTABLES THROUGH THE STREETS OF GLADSTONOPOLIS PROTESTING THAT HE WAS FORCED TO HIS DOOM TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME
IF IT WERE ONLY POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT GO SO THAT JACK MIGHT BE MARRIED TO THE GIRL HE LOVED THAT MIGHT BE WELL
AND THE UNFORTUNATE BARONET WHOM JACK HAD NEARLY SLAUGHTERED HAD ENCOUNTERED THE ILL-WILL OF THE ENTIRE CLUB BECAUSE HE HAD CALLED FOR MUTTON-BROTH WHEN HE WAS SEA-SICK
WHAT A FELLOW TO SEND OUT
TO HAVE DIED AT YOUR BEHEST AT THE INSTANT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS NOTHING
HE WOULD HAVE RUINED LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH HAD HE STAYED THERE MUCH LONGER BUT EVERYTHING HE DID SEEMED TO PROSPER
YOU AND YOUNG GRUNDLE TOGETHER ARE IN A CONSPIRACY TO GET RID OF ME
THAT WHICH WE SHOULD BE READY TO CLAIM AS THE HIGHEST HONOUR,--AS BEING AN ADVANCE IN PROGRESS AND GENERAL CIVILISATION NEVER HITHERTO EVEN THOUGHT OF AMONG OTHER PEOPLE,--TO HAVE CONCEIVED THAT AND TO HAVE PREPARED IT IN EVERY DETAIL FOR PERFECT CONSUMMATION,--THAT IS TO BE ACCOUNTED AS AN OPPROBRIUM TO OUR CHILDREN BY YOU THE LADY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
THE JOHN BRIGHT IN OUR HARBOUR IS THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE PROOF THAT SUCH PREJUDICES STILL EXIST
EVERY BALL AS IT CAME TO HIM WAS SENT AWAY INTO INFINITE SPACE
I HAD SAID NOTHING AND HAD ENDEAVOURED TO THINK AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE OF THE FIXED PERIOD
WHAT SPOT AS THE DAUGHTER OF THE FIRST DEPOSITED OF THE FIXED PERIOD PEOPLE,--IF EVER THAT COMES OFF
THE POOR FELLOW TO WHOM NATURE HAS BEEN UNKIND DEPARTS FROM US DECREPIT AND WORN OUT AT FORTY
JACK WAS SILENT DETERMINED AND YET INWARDLY PROUD OF HIMSELF FEELING THAT THE WHOLE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE REPUBLIC WAS ON HIS SHOULDERS
HE HAD NOT DONE MUCH WHEN THE BRITANNULISTS WERE IN BEFORE,--HAD ONLY MADE SOME THIRTY OR FORTY RUNS
AS I THOUGHT OF ALL THIS I ALMOST FEARED JACK'S PRESENCE IN GLADSTONOPOLIS MORE THAN THAT OF THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN
THOUGH THERE WAS A STRONG PARTY IN HIS FAVOUR I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE MEDDLED MUCH WITH IT
BEAUTY IS THE SAME ALL THE WORLD OVER AND HER MONEY WILL BE THOUGHT OF QUITE AS MUCH THERE AS HERE BUT SHE WILL HAVE SUCH A SPOT UPON HER SPOT
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO WHEN HE SHALL HAVE TAKEN HIS POCKET-PISTOL AWAY I THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE WHAT ANSWER IT WOULD BEST BECOME ME TO GIVE TO THIS QUESTION BUT I PAUSED ONLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
SHE ALWAYS CALLED ME MR PRESIDENT WHEN SHE INTENDED TO OPPOSE ME
IF A FELLOW IS TO MAKE HIS HOME FOR A MONTH UPON THE SEAS IT IS AS WELL TO MAKE IT AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL THINK IT
HE TRUDGED AWAY WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF TRIUMPH
AND LETTERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE THIS,--TREACHEROUS LETTERS CALLING FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY IN OPPOSITION TO THE COUNCILS OF THEIR OWN
HE WAS A FINE FRANK FELLOW AND WAS JACK'S GREAT FRIEND
THERE NEVER COULD ARRIVE A TIME OR A PEOPLE WHEN OR AMONG WHOM THE SYSTEM COULD BE TRIED WITH SO GOOD A HOPE OF SUCCESS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INDECENT TO DO SO AT SUCH A MOMENT AND SOMETHING AT ANY RATE WAS DUE TO THE POSITION OF CRASWELLER
HE WOULD NOT BE TEMPTED OUT OF HIS GROUND BUT STOOD THERE AWAITING THE BALL LET IT COME EVER SO SLOWLY
WHEN I CAME HOME I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK AND I SHALL INSIST ON YOUR PUTTING IT ON THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING IN ORDER THAT I MAY SEE THAT IT SITS FLAT
SUCH HAD BEEN MY AMBITION SUCH HAD BEEN MY HOPE
IN SOME MOMENTS OF PRIVATE THOUGHT ANXIOUS AS WERE NOW MY OWN THEY TOO MUST HAVE DOUBTED
BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT
MY GRASSES ARE PECULIARLY DRY AND MY FLOCKS ARE REMARKABLY WELL LOOKED AFTER
ALL MY DREAMS OF A PERSONAL AMBITION WERE AT ONCE SHIVERED TO THE GROUND
THERE WILL NOT AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT BE ANY FIXED PERIOD FOR HUMAN LIFE IN BRITANNULA
FAREWELL
FAREWELL
HE'S JUST AS FIT TO LIVE AS ARE YOU AND I THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER HE BE FIT TO DIE,--OR RATHER TO BE DEPOSITED I MEAN
LET US SAY A HUNDRED SAID I ALOUD TURNING UPON THEM ALL THE BATTERY OF MY RIDICULE
BUT YOU HAVE NOT I SAID AT ALL REALISED THE FEELING OF THE CEREMONY
AND HE HAD ALLUDED TO THE MANNER OF DEPOSITING IN MOST DISRESPECTFUL TERMS
I WAS DOING GOOD THEN
HE WAS ANXIOUS TO HURRY ON THE DEPOSITION OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW IN ORDER THAT THE ENTIRE POSSESSION OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH MIGHT COME INTO HIS OWN HANDS JUST ONE YEAR THE EARLIER
BUT THE ONLY RESULT WAS THAT THE BALL WAS SENT STILL FURTHER OFF WHEN IT REACHED JACK'S WICKET
THERE WON'T BE ANY SMELL AT ALL--NOT THE LEAST
THIS I HAD BEEN PREPARED TO ACCEPT AS BEING UNAVOIDABLE
SHE STILL HAD ON THE LITTLE ROUND HAT BUT AS JACK WENT SHE LAID IT ASIDE
BUT I WILL PROCEED
WHAT YOU DID YOU DID FOR YOUR FATHER'S SAKE AND PAPA
THE BRITANNULISTS SPEAK ENGLISH AS WELL AS I DO AND WILL I AM SURE ADMIT THAT WE BOAST OF A COMMON COUNTRY BUT NOT A COMMON GOVERNMENT SAID I DETERMINED TO FIRE A PARTING SHOT
INDEED FOR MERE CRICKET JACK SWORE THAT THE ENGLISH WOULD BE NOWHERE BUT FOR EIGHT PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS WHOM THEY HAD BROUGHT OUT WITH THEM
IN REGARD TO MR NEVERBEND HIMSELF IT IS THE ESPECIAL WISH OF H.M
I AS THE DAY WENT ON FOUND MYSELF WORKED UP TO SUCH EXCITEMENT THAT I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY HAT ON MY HEAD OR BEHAVE MYSELF WITH BECOMING PRESIDENTIAL DIGNITY
THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE NOT SOFT AND FLABBY BEFORE THEM AS WAS THE CASE WITH YOURS I THINK LORD MARYLEBONE LOOKED ACROSS THE TABLE I AM TOLD AT SIR KENNINGTON OVAL AND NOTHING AFTERWARDS WAS SAID ABOUT DIET
I HEARD A WHISPER ONE DAY BETWEEN TWO OF THE STEWARDS
THERE MAY BE DIVERGENCES AS IN REFERENCE TO THE NON-INFLICTION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
AND THEN AS I SOON UNDERSTOOD THE CAPTAIN EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD DEPART
AND THE VESSEL BRINGING THEM WILL BE DUE HERE ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEXT WEDNESDAY ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEXT WEDNESDAY SAID I IN SURPRISE
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD RISE AGAINST HIM WHEN INFORMED IN ITS IGNORANCE OF THE CONTEMPLATED INTENTION
YES YES SAID HE
EACH OF US HAS HIS OWN CRIB WITH A BATH TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE ET-CETERAS
HE HAD GIVEN UP THE FICTITIOUS YEAR AND HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD ASSENTED TO THE DOCTRINE WITH WHICH HE WAS NOW ASKED TO COMPLY
BUT HE WAS SOON PUT OUT OF HIS TROUBLE
THE READER WILL SEE HOW IMPORTANT AS TIME WENT ON IT WOULD BECOME TO HAVE AN ACCURATE RECORD AND I ALREADY THEN FEARED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WANT OF FIDELITY AFTER I MYSELF HAD BEEN DEPOSITED
I HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT IT I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
THE MATCH WAS AFTERWARDS CARRIED ON WITH FIFTEEN ON EACH SIDE
THAT LOOK OF STUBBORNNESS WHICH I HAD BEFORE OBSERVED AGAIN SPREADING ITSELF OVER HIS FACE
BUT FELLOW-CITIZENS WE MUST LOOK THE TRUTH IN THE FACE
BUT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT SHOW ANY ENTHUSIASM
SIXTY-SEVEN AND A HALF WAS NAMED BY A MAJORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY AS THE FIXED PERIOD
REMEMBER IT BECOMES FRIGHTFULLY COLD ALMOST AT ONCE
THE FLEECES FOR BEARING WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS FLOCKS THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE SHORN BY HIM WOULD NEVER RETURN THEIR PRICES TO HIS ACCOUNT
BUT I CAN HARDLY KEEP MYSELF QUIET AS I THINK OF THE SUFFERINGS WHICH I HAVE ENDURED DURING THE LAST MONTH BUT CRASWELLER YOU HAD ASSENTED TRUE
MANY ARGUMENTS WERE USED AGAINST US BUT WERE VAIN AND FUTILE IN THEIR CONCEPTION
ONE SEAT HAD BEEN DEMANDED FOR MRS NEVERBEND
IT SEEMED TO ME AS THOUGH HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE TO LEVEL IT STRAIGHT AND EVEN AT SIR KENNINGTON'S HEAD
ON THE DAY AFTER THE DINNER AT WHICH EVA'S PUDDING WAS EATEN ABRAHAM GRUNDLE CAME TO ME AT THE EXECUTIVE HALL AND SAID THAT HE HAD A FEW THINGS TO DISCUSS WITH ME OF IMPORTANCE
A CERTAIN SENSE OF RELIEF CAME UPON MY MIND JUST THEN BECAUSE I FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD COME TO INTERFERE WITH THE WORK WHICH I HAD IN HAND
NO DOUBT WE SHALL DO SO WHEN IT IS ONLY OURSELVES THAT WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE BUT NEVER WHEN THE QUESTION CONCERNS OUR HUSBANDS OUR FATHERS AND OUR SONS THIS WAS A PRETTY LITTLE SPEECH ENOUGH AND RECEIVED THE EAGER COMPLIMENTS OF THE OFFICERS OF THE JOHN BRIGHT
IT IS SIMPLY A CONTEST BETWEEN BRUTE STRENGTH AND MENTAL ENERGY IF YOU WILL LOOK AT THE CONTESTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD SAID SIR FERDINANDO YOU WILL GENERALLY FIND THAT THE HIGHEST RESPECT IS PAID TO THE GREATEST BATTALIONS WHAT WORLD-WIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN
I HAD INTENDED TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT CRASWELLER BUT I WISHED OUR FRIEND'S NAME TO COME FIRST FROM HIM
WE KNOW WHAT OUR PRECIOUS LIVES ARE WORTH
I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE SOME TIME ABOUT MID-WINTER I SAID
THAT GOVERNOR WAS TO BE SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
WHEN YOU HEAR MY NAME MENTIONED AFTER I AM GONE I HOPE THAT THEY'LL SAY OF ME THAT I DID MY DUTY AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF COURSE THEY WILL
BUT MY FRIEND CRASWELLER WAS THE FIRST ON THE LIST AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE EMPIRE AS TO THE EXACT DAY ON WHICH HE WAS BORN
HE WAS DESIROUS HE SAID OF EXPLAINING TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE THE OBJECTS OF H.M
CRASWELLER MIGHT IN TRUTH BE STRONG AND HEARTY AT THE FIXED PERIOD
SO I IMAGINE THERE WAS AN HONESTY ABOUT CROSSTREES WHICH WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIM TO SOFTEN ANYTHING
OH MR NEVERBEND I KNOW WHAT A GOOD THING IT IS--TO TALK ABOUT
I CONGRATULATE YOU
WE WERE THE ELITE OF THE SELECTED POPULATION OF NEW ZEALAND
MR CRASWELLER WILL GIVE YOU NO SUCH TROUBLE AS YOU SUGGEST SAID I
I COULD NOT GO ON TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT HE THUS RAN AWAY FROM HIS OLD ARGUMENT ABOUT THE DUKE
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT LADY BROWN DID NOT DO HER DUTY PROPERLY BY HIM
IN THIS GENERATION PROBABLY THE FIXED PERIOD MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE IN ABEYANCE WHEN I HAD UTTERED THESE WORDS THERE CAME MUCH CHEERING AND A LOUD SOUND OF TRIUMPH WHICH WAS INDORSED PROBABLY BY THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE SYSTEM WHICH HAD ITS TERRORS
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY GIRL IN THE OLD COUNTRY WAS EVER BETTER PROVIDED FOR THAN WILL BE EVA THIS I SAID WISHING TO COMFORT HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME TO PREPARE FOR WHAT WAS TO BE SAID
HE HAS NOT SEEN OUR YACHT YET
I SAT FOR A FEW MINUTES IN SILENCE THINKING THAT AS MR CRASWELLER HAD BANISHED EVA HE WOULD BEGIN
BUT THE PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT EVA CRASWELLER AND ABRAHAM GRUNDLE AND I TELL YOU THAT ALL THE VOLUNTEERS YOU HAVE IN BRITANNULA WILL NOT SUFFICE TO TAKE THE OLD MAN TO THE COLLEGE AND TO KEEP HIM THERE TILL YOU HAVE POLISHED HIM OFF
BUT IT IS ALTOGETHER WASTED BECAUSE I KNEW IT ALL BEFOREHAND AND WITH PEN AND INK COULD HAVE WRITTEN DOWN THE LECTURE WHICH SHE DELIVERED AT THAT PECULIAR MOMENT
TO TAKE A MAN AWAY BY FORCE AND HE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
COME INTO THE HOUSE THEN I ENTERED IN UNDER THE VERANDAH AND HE FOLLOWED
BUT SHE DID GO
AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT JACK WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD
CRASWELLER HAD ALSO EMBARKED HIS MONEY LARGELY IN THE WOOL TRADE AND HAD BECOME A SLEEPING-PARTNER IN THE HOUSE OF GRUNDLE GRABBE
NOW NEVERBEND REMEMBER YOU WEAR THE FLANNEL DRAWERS I PUT UP FOR YOU AS SOON AS EVER YOU GET OUT OF THE OPPOSITE TROPICS
IT WAS DECIDED I WILL CONFESS BY THE COMMON VOICE OF THE ISLAND THAT WE SHOULD ADMIT THIS GOVERNOR AND SWEAR FEALTY AGAIN TO THE BRITISH CROWN
THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH HAS FALLEN UPON ME CRASWELLER I WILL COME AND LIVE WITH YOU AND BE A BROTHER TO YOU DURING THE ENTIRE TWELVE MONTHS NO
YES INDEED
CHAPTER V
BUT IF HE AND HIS DAUGHTER HAVE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER
MRS NEVERBEND DID IN TRUTH GO TO SLEEP BUT I LAY AWAKE DURING THE WHOLE NIGHT THINKING OF THE TROUBLES BEFORE ME
THE HOUSE IS AWARE I BELIEVE HE SAID THAT THE FIRST OPERATION WILL SOON BE NEEDED I MAY AS WELL STATE HERE THAT THIS WAS REPEATED TO EVA AND THAT SHE PRETENDED TO TAKE HUFF AT SUCH A QUESTION FROM HER LOVER
B
CRASWELLER THE TRIUMPHANT WOULD LIVE AND AT LAST DIE AMIDST THE FLOCKS AND HERDS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
OH MY FRIENDS SAID HE RISING TO THE ALTITUDES OF HIS ELOQUENCE IT IS FITTING FOR US THAT WE SHOULD LEAVE THESE THINGS IN THE HANDS OF THE ALMIGHTY
I ONLY ASK FOR ONE YEAR
BUT FIRST OF ALL IS REQUIRED THAT SELF-NEGATION WHICH IS ABLE TO PLAN NEW BLESSINGS ALTHOUGH CERTAIN THAT THOSE BLESSINGS WILL BE ACCOUNTED AS CURSES BY THE WORLD AT LARGE
IT WAS PUT FORWARD BY SOME WHO OPPOSED THE MOVEMENT THAT THE OLD THEMSELVES WOULD NOT LIKE IT
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE RAVISHED OUR EARS MOST WITH THE OLD-FASHIONED PIANO AND THE NEARLY OBSOLETE VIOLIN OR WITH THE MODERN MOUSOMETOR OR THE MORE PERFECT MELPOMENEON
JACK HAD CHOSEN TO TAKE THIS AS A BIT OF GENUINE IMPERTINENCE AND HAD BEEN VERY SORE ABOUT IT
WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO SAY SO WELL SIR,--YOU SEE THAT A PARTY OF US WERE QUITE DETERMINED
SO YOUR NEW GOVERNOR HAS TOLD YOU BUT HE HAS NOT TOLD YOU THE EXACT TRUTH
STILL I HAD GONE ON AND HAD WATCHED THEM AS THEY GREW FROM DAY TO DAY AND HAD ALLOWED NO SHILLING TO BE SPARED IN PERFECTING THEM
HE HESITATED A GOOD DEAL NAY ALMOST BROKE DOWN WHEN HE GAVE THE HEALTH OF SIR KENNINGTON OVAL AND THE BRITISH SIXTEEN
I HAD FLATTERED MYSELF THAT I DID IT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
I HOPE THAT YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT THEY SHALL EVER INTERFERE WITH YOU AFTER A ROUGHER FASHION
BUT IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY SO
I MUST BE SOLEMN TOO,--SILENT AS THE CHURCHYARD MOURNFUL AS THE GRAVE,--BECAUSE OF THE TRUTH
HE NEVER EVEN IN CONVERSATION ALLUDED TO BRITANNULA AND SPOKE ALWAYS OF THE DOCKYARD AT DEVONPORT AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH ITS EVERY CORNER
THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE EXCEPT A REPETITION OF THE PREJUDICES OF THE OLD WORLD
HOW TRIUMPHANT THEY NOW APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN IN FIGHTING AGAINST THE ENORMOUS ODDS WHICH POWER HAD BROUGHT AGAINST THEM
DO WE NOT CALL THE AMERICANS FOREIGNERS GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS ENGAGED IN THE GREAT MARITIME CONTEST WITH THE UNITED FLEETS OF RUSSIA AND AMERICA AND HAD ONLY JUST MADE THAT GLORIOUS PEACE BY WHICH AS POLITICIANS SAID ALL THE WORLD WAS TO BE GOVERNED FOR THE FUTURE
BUT I HAD TO BID FAREWELL TO MY WIFE AND MY SON AND TO EVA AND CRASWELLER
I WAS SITTING THERE SILENT IN CRASWELLER'S VERANDAH AS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
I COULD WITH THE GREATEST ALACRITY IN THE WORLD FIRE THAT BIG GUN IN AMONG BATTALIONS OF ARMED MEN SO AS TO SCATTER THEM ALL TO THE WINDS BUT I COULD NOT POINT IT IN THE DIRECTION OF A SINGLE GIRL WE WENT ON DISCUSSING THE MATTER AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH AND HIS CONVICTIONS WERE QUITE AS STRONG AS MINE
NOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH US EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE LEGALLY
MY HEART HAS NEVER FAINTED WHATEVER SOME OTHERS MAY HAVE DONE CHAPTER VI
THERE WAS I SUPPOSE IN THE ESTIMATION OF ENGLISHMEN TIME ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND YET WOULD I SCRUPLE FOR A MOMENT TO DEPOSIT YOU IN THE COLLEGE WHEN THE DAY HAD COME
YOU WILL THEREFORE ARRIVE THERE IN AMPLE TIME TO PREVENT THE FIRST BLOODSHED
HE STILL WENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS WITH AN ALACRITY MARVELLOUS IN ONE WHO WAS SO SOON ABOUT TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THE WORLD
I WISH TO SPEAK WITH ALL RESPECT OF SIR WILLIAM GLADSTONE
I DON'T WANT TO QUARREL MR PRESIDENT THERE SHALL BE NO QUARREL
I HAD FELT A VICARIOUS REGARD FOR THE HONOUR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HIM ALMOST REGARDING IT AS THOUGH I MYSELF WERE TO GO IN HIS PLACE
WE ARE BUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SAID GRUNDLE AND SEE WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE ARE COCKS FIGHTING ON OUR OWN DUNGHILL SAID JACK AND THAT DOES MAKE A DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BUT I WAS TOLD THAT JACK HAD SPOKEN A WORD TO EVA IN QUITE A DIFFERENT SPIRIT BEFORE HE HAD LEFT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
IF IT WERE KNOWN THROUGH THE CAPITAL THAT CRASWELLER WAS ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN A YEAR'S GRACE BY MEANS OF SO FOUL A LIE THE YEAR'S GRACE WOULD BE ACCORDED TO HIM
AND AS IS CUSTOMARY ON SUCH OCCASIONS I ENDEAVOURED TO BECOME SPECIALLY GRACIOUS AND COMMUNICATIVE
I WAS ASSURED AFTERWARDS THAT ONE OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS COULD GO TEN MILES INLAND AND STILL HOLD COMMUNICATION WITH HIS CAPTAIN
BUT EVEN THE GUM-TREES HAD NOT AS YET DONE MUCH TO GIVE A FURNISHED APPEARANCE TO THE PLACE
AFTER ALL A BIT OF BUNTING IS EASY NOR ON ITS FLAG LORD MARYLEBONE BUT ON THE HEARTS OF ITS PEOPLE
I SUPPOSE OLD CRASWELLER WILL BE THE FIRST I SUPPOSE SO IT WILL BE A GRUESOME TIME WHEN I HAVE TO GO TO BED EARLY SO AS NOT TO SEE THE SMOKE COME OUT OF HIS CHIMNEY I TELL YOU THERE WILL BE NOTHING OF THE KIND
AND I WAS TOLD THAT A GLEAM OF JOY SHOT ACROSS HIS WORN SORROWFUL FACE WHEN SIR KENNINGTON BEGAN THE SECOND INNINGS WITH TEN RUNS
YOU HAVE TO BE ELECTED A PEER OF PARLIAMENT OR YOU CAN SIT NOWHERE
IT IS YOUR PURPOSE TO CARRY OUT YOUR FIXED PERIOD AS SOON AS THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL HAVE DEPARTED CERTAINLY AND YOU ARE I AM AWARE SUFFICIENTLY POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE HERE TO ENABLE YOU TO DO SO I THINK I AM I SAID WITH A MODEST ACQUIESCENCE IN AN ASSERTION WHICH I FELT TO BE SO MUCH TO MY CREDIT
SHE'S NOTHING MORE TO HIM THAN A PRETTY PROVINCIAL LASS
AT ANY RATE HIS LIMBS WILL HAVE LOST ALL THAT ROBUST AGILITY WHICH IS NEEDED FOR THE ADEQUATE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK OF THE WORLD
IT WAS CLEAR HOWEVER THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE TILL THE ENGLISHMEN WERE GONE AND AS I HAD A DAY AT MY DISPOSAL I DETERMINED TO WALK UP TO THE COLLEGE AND MEDITATE THERE ON THE CONDUCT WHICH IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO FOLLOW DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS
SHE FORMS HER OPINION FROM THE THINGS AROUND HER AND IS IN REGARD TO DOMESTIC LIFE AND TO HER NEIGHBOURS AND TO THE CONDUCT OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM SHE LIVES ALMOST INVARIABLY RIGHT
NOW THERE'S MY GOVERNOR'S FATHER SAID LORD ALFRED
IT ADDED AT ANY RATE NEW FIRE TO EVERY BRITANNULIST ON THE GROUND AND I MUST SAY THAT AFTER THAT MR BRITTLEREED MANAGED THE MATTER ALTOGETHER TO JACK'S SATISFACTION
THESE ARE THE IDEAS THAT HAVE ACTUATED ME AND TO THEM I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BY SEEING THE CONDUCT OF THOSE AROUND ME
TO ME IT SEEMS RATIONAL TO SUPPOSE THAT AS WE LEAVE THIS BODY SO SHALL WE ENTER THAT NEW PHASE OF LIFE IN WHICH WE ARE DESTINED TO LIVE;--BUT WITH ALL OUR HIGHER RESOLVES SOMEWHAT SHARPENED AND WITH OUR LOWER PASSIONS ALAS
THE NASTY LITTLE SELFISH SLUT SAID MRS NEVERBEND
THIS IS WHERE WE PRETEND TO SIT CONTINUED THE LORD
COLUMBUS AND GALILEO AND NEWTON AND HARVEY AND WILBERFORCE AND COBDEN AND THAT GREAT BANTING WHO HAS PRESERVED US ALL SO COMPLETELY FROM THE HORRORS OF OBESITY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NAMED WITH HONOUR MORE RESPLENDENT THAN THAT PAID TO THE NAME OF NEVERBEND
BARNES AND TALLOWAX WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND THE THING WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE
IT IS NOT SO ONLY BECAUSE THE LAW ENACTS IT
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO MEET YOU HERE AT ANY HOUR TO-MORROW AND TO RECEIVE THE BRITANNULAN ARCHIVES FROM YOUR HANDS
BUT TO BE OBDURATE WITH EVA WAS INDEED A STRUGGLE
I CAN HARDLY TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF AN OLD FELLOW HE IS AT HOME
BUT NOT A SHILLING HAD AS YET BEEN CLAIMED BY ANY MAN UNDER THAT LAW
ROUND THE TEMPLE AT THE BACK OF IT WERE THE SETS OF CHAMBERS IN WHICH WERE TO LIVE THE DEPOSITED DURING THEIR YEAR OF PROBATION
OUR POPULATION AT GLADSTONOPOLIS WAS SO THRIVING THAT WE FOUND IT AS EASY TO COLLECT TEN PENNIES AS ONE
THE NEW GOVERNOR
THE NEW GOVERNOR
DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES THEY WERE TO BE SAVED FROM ANY OF THE HORRORS OF POVERTY
THERE IS NOTHING THAT HE WOULD NOT DO FOR YOU HE IS A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN SAID I THINKING OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN AGAINST ME ON THE TOWN FLAGS
THE ENGLISH WENT IN FIRST WITH THE TWO BARONETS AT THE WICKETS
BUT I TOOK NO OFFENCE AT HIS VOTE
WHO ARE YOU TO LIKEN YOURSELF TO GALILEO?--AN OLD FELLOW OF THAT KIND WHO LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS AGO BEFORE CHRISTIANITY HAD EVER BEEN INVENTED
IN FACT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE UTENSIL BY WHICH WE WOULD HAVE CLAPPED A SOUTHERN CROSS OVER THE BRITISH ARMS AND PUT THE PORTRAIT OF THE BRITANNULAN PRESIDENT OF THE DAY,--MINE FOR INSTANCE,--IN THE PLACE WHERE THE FACE OF THE BRITISH MONARCH HAS HITHERTO HELD ITS OWN
BUT WE DECIDED AT LAST TO DIVIDE THE INTERVAL
MY DEAR YOU CANNOT HAVE SEEN THE COLLEGE
AND IF A MAN MAY NOT SLAY HIMSELF HOW SHALL HE THEN IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS POOR HUMAN WIT DEVOTE A FELLOW-CREATURE TO CERTAIN DEATH AND HE AS WELL AS EVER HE WAS IN HIS LIFE SAID TALLOWAX IN THE GALLERY
I THINK I MANAGED TO ANSWER HIM
WE MEAN TO GO BACK AS A REPUBLIC
AT ONE PERIOD AS I SHALL HAVE TO TELL I ALTOGETHER DISGRACED MYSELF
WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WRITE OUR LETTERS AND READ OUR BOOKS
I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON HIS MIND TO WHICH HE HARDLY DARED TO GIVE WORDS
AS FAR AS MY OPINION GOES JACK NEVERBEND IS TEN TO ONE A BETTER SORT OF FELLOW THAN ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
IF HE WILL TELL ME THAT HE IS NOT AS YET PREPARED TO DISCARD THEM AND THAT I AM IN ERROR IN THINKING THAT THE WORLD IS SO PREPARED I MAY PERHAPS AGREE WITH HIM
IT STREAMS ON WITHOUT A PAUSE AND WITHOUT ANY NECESSARY END BUT THAT WHICH THE CONVENIENCE OF TIME MAY DICTATE
YES;--UP THE HILL THEY CAME THREE GILDED BRITISH NAVAL OFFICERS SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF BRITANNULANS
BUT EVA HAD NOT THEN CARED FOR COLONELS OF CURRICULUMS BUT HAD THOUGHT MORE OF YOUNG GRUNDLE'S MOUSTACHE
I PRAY FOR YOU SAID HIS MOTHER
MY MIND MISGAVE ME AS I THOUGHT OF ALL THESE OBSTRUCTIONS AND I FELT THAT I COULD SO WILLINGLY DEPOSIT MYSELF AT ONCE AND THEN DEPART WITHOUT WAITING FOR MY YEAR OF PROBATION
WHAT WILL THEY SAY IF I ONLY KNEW HOW BEST I COULD TELL YOU
I HARDLY KNEW AS I TURNED IT ALL IN MY MIND WHICH OF THE TWO WAS THE MORE SORDID
I THEN WENT UP-STAIRS TO TAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL WALK WITH MR CROSSTREES ON THE DECK
AFTER DINNER CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SIMPLY PROPOSED MY HEALTH PAYING TO ME MANY UNMEANING COMPLIMENTS IN WHICH HOWEVER I OBSERVED THAT NO REFERENCE WAS MADE TO THE SPECIAL DOINGS OF MY PRESIDENCY
IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD CONTINUED ABRAHAM AND I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT ONCE SO THAT EVA MIGHT GET USED TO HER NEW LIFE BEFORE HER PAPA WAS DEPOSITED TO THIS I MERELY BOWED MY HEAD AS THOUGH TO SIGNIFY THAT IT WAS A MATTER WITH WHICH I WAS NOT PERSONALLY CONCERNED
IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I I MYSELF HAVE NEVER FOR A MOMENT SWERVED
I KNOW A PICTURE OF THE GODDESS ALL HELMET SPEAR AND PETTICOATS CARRYING HER SPEAR OVER HER SHOULDER AS SHE FLIES THROUGH THE AIR OVER THE CITIES OF THE EARTH
IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF WHAT A SINGLE OLD MAN CAN DO,--YOU WITH YOUR 250-TON SWIVELLERS AND YOUR GUARD OF MARINES AND YOUR NORTH-NORTH-WEST BIRMINGHAM SOLDIERY THAT DEPENDS ON WHO AND WHAT THE OLD MAN MAY BE THIS WAS THE FIRST COMPLIMENTARY SPEECH WHICH SIR FERDINANDO HAD MADE AND I MUST CONFESS THAT IT WAS EFFICACIOUS
THE IGNORANCE WHICH WE ARE TOLD THAT WE HAD EXPELLED FROM OUR SHORES HAS COME BACK TO US
HE HAD IN TRUTH GOT HIS EYE IN AND AS SURELY AS THE BALL CAME TO HIM IT WAS SENT AWAY TO SOME MOST DISTANT PART OF THE GROUND
NOW I THINK OF IT THE ALPINE CLUB FROM SYDNEY ARE TO BE IN NEW ZEALAND THIS SUMMER AND IT WILL SUIT YOU VERY WELL TO GO AND CLIMB UP MOUNT EARNSHAWE AND SEE ALL THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE INSTEAD OF TALKING NONSENSE HERE IN GLADSTONOPOLIS OH FATHER I SHOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER CRIED JACK ENTHUSIASTICALLY
MY LIFE,--HOW WILLINGLY COULD I RUN ANY RISK DID BUT THE QUESTION ARISE OF RISKING IT
ALL RIGHT
IF OLD CRASWELLER GOES OFF IN HIS STEAM-CARRIAGE HOW AM I TO GO AFTER HIM AND WHOM AM I TO ASK TO HELP TO BRING HIM BACK AGAIN I WAS PUZZLED BUT I DID NOT CARE TO SHOW IT
I HAD LEFT GRAYBODY WITH A LIE ON MY TONGUE
BUT YET HOW LARGE A PROPORTION OF THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD REMAINS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED THAT AGE AND ARE UNABLE FROM SENILE IMBECILITY TO EMPLOY THAT WEALTH AS IT SHOULD BE USED
I BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT THE PLACE WAS TOO SMALL FOR MAKING THE PRIMARY EFFORTS IN SO GREAT A CAUSE
I THERE FOUND JACK WAITING FOR ME AND WE TOGETHER WALKED DOWN TO THE QUAY
YOU DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN ABOUT THE CONFISCATION OF THE PROPERTY SAID ABRAHAM
THERE IS NO REASON WHY JACK SHOULDN'T OBEY ME AS WELL AS YOU
BUT ALL THAT IS A DETAIL WITH WHICH UP HERE WE NEED NOT PERHAPS CONCERN OURSELVES ONLY THE TIME IS GETTING VERY SHORT MR PRESIDENT AND MY OLD WOMAN WILL BREAK DOWN ALTOGETHER IF SHE'S TOLD THAT SHE'S TO LIVE ANOTHER YEAR ALL ALONE
MIGHT IT NOT BE BETTER FOR ME TO ABANDON ALTOGETHER THE FIXED PERIOD AND ALL ITS GLORIES
THE CHAMBER IS A VERY SPACIOUS ONE FITTED UP WITH A LARGE ORGAN AND ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS NECESSARY FOR A MUSIC-HALL
EVA IS A GOOD GIRL,--A DEAR GIRL
IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT DURING THE LAST YEAR OR TWO WE HAVE LIVED WITH DIFFERENT HOPES
MRS NEVERBEND SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD ACCOMPANY ME SO AS TO LOOK AFTER MY LINEN AND OTHER PERSONAL COMFORTS
AS THESE PAINFUL THOUGHTS WERE AGITATING MY MIND A SLOW DECREPIT OLD GENTLEMAN CAME UP TO ME AND GREETED ME AS MR PRESIDENT
BUT I KNEW WELL THAT THEY HAD DISCUSSED THE QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD AMONG THEM AND THAT THERE WAS STILL TIME FOR THEM TO GO HOME AND SEND BACK SOME ENGLISH MANDATE WHICH OUGHT TO BE INOPERATIVE BUT WHICH WE SHOULD BE UNABLE TO DISOBEY
HOW WILL YOU GET OVER THAT MR PRESIDENT A SMALL PEOPLE,--NUMERICALLY SMALL,--CANNOT OF COURSE DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE
BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO ME THEN THAT CRASWELLER HAD BEEN AS ENERGETIC AS MYSELF
YOU ARE MY ONE AND ONLY FRIEND AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE ME,--AND YOU ALSO DISBELIEVE IN ME
THE MANGOES CAME FROM JAMAICA AND ARE AS FRESH AS THE DAY THEY WERE PICKED I ATE MY MANGO-PUDDING BUT I DID NOT ENJOY IT FOR I WAS SURE THAT THE WHOLE CREW WERE RETURNING TO ENGLAND LADEN WITH PREJUDICES AGAINST THE FIXED PERIOD
THEY MUST LACK A WARMTH WHICH THE OTHERS POSSESS
I CONFESS THAT MY BELIEF IN THE EFFICACY OF SPOKEN WORDS OF WORDS RUNNING LIKE AN ELECTRIC SPARK FROM THE LIPS OF THE SPEAKER RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF HIM WHO HEARD THEM WAS STRONGER FAR THAN MY TRUST IN WRITTEN ARGUMENTS
BUT YET THERE WAS IN IT SOMETHING UNFORTUNATE
AT THESE READINGS GABRIEL CRASWELLER WAS THE FAVOURITE PERFORMER AND IT HAD BEGUN TO BE WHISPERED BY SOME CAITIFFS WHO WOULD WILLINGLY DISARRANGE THE WHOLE STARRY SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION THAT CRASWELLER SHOULD NOT BE DEPOSITED BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTY OF HIS VOICE
HAD THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ORDERED THE THREE-MONTHS-OLD BABY TO BE SLAUGHTERED I WAS NOT THE MAN TO SLAUGHTER IT EVEN THOUGH I WERE THE SWORN SERVANT OF THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT
WHO THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD SAID EVA
LOOK ROUND ON THE MEN WHOM YOU CAN REMEMBER AND TELL ME ON HOW MANY OF THEM LIFE HAS NOT SAT AS A BURDEN AT SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE MEN ARE SO DIFFERENT SAID HE
EVERY MAN FROM ENGLAND HAD HIS ATTENDANT TO LOOK AFTER HIS BATS AND BALLS AND SHOES AND GREAVES
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF THE PRESENT DATE HE WAS DUE TO BE DETAINED THERE AS THE FIRST INHABITANT
HE MAKES US FLOWERY SPEECHES AND THINKS THAT THEY WILL STAND IN LIEU OF INDEPENDENCE
AND THOUGH THERE WERE DISPUTES ON THE SUBJECT IN NONE OF THEM WAS OPPOSITION MADE TO THE SYSTEM
BUT THAT WHICH VEXED ME MOST WAS THAT GABRIEL CRASWELLER SHOULD DESIRE TO ESCAPE,--THAT HE SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO THROW OVER THE WHOLE SYSTEM TO PRESERVE THE POOR REMNANT OF HIS LIFE
IT IS ALL FOR HIS DAUGHTER I HAD SAID TO MYSELF
I HAD TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT MY OLD FRIEND WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER SETTLED AND LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH PUT INTO HIS DAUGHTER'S HANDS BEFORE HE SHOULD BID ADIEU TO HIS OWN SUBLUNARY AFFAIRS I REMARKED WHEN I FOUND THAT HE PAUSED
I HAD ALREADY SELECTED ONE NOT BY ANY MEANS THE FINEST OR THE LARGEST FOR MYSELF AND MY WIFE IN WHICH WE MIGHT PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE GRAND DEPARTURE
I HAVE NOT YET SEEN THOSE ENGLISH BEAUTIES OF WHICH SO MUCH IS SAID IN THEIR OWN ROMANCES BUT WHOM THE YOUNG MEN FROM NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO MAKE THEIR WAY TO GLADSTONOPOLIS DO NOT SEEM TO ADMIRE VERY MUCH
WE ARE TO BE SLAVES,--SLAVES BECAUSE ENGLAND SO WILLS IT
BUT IN THESE VERY MOMENTS THE NECESSARY STRENGTH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THEM
THE GOOD OF THE COMMONWEALTH,--AND HIS OWN,--REQUIRES THAT BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE HE SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO EXIST
I BEGAN TO FANCY AS THE DANGER BECAME NEARER AND STILL NEARER THAT NEITHER OF THOSE GREAT MEN HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS ENCOMPASSED ME
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WAS IN MY SEAT AND ON LOOKING ROUND I COULD SEE THAT ALL THE RANK AND FASHION OF BRITANNULA WERE AT THE GROUND
YOU HAVE BEEN INTELLIGENT INDUSTRIOUS AND PRUDENT
YOUR SON HAS ASKED ME--TO BE HIS WIFE I HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT HE HAS LOVED YOU WELL BUT IT CAN NEVER BE SHE SAID IF MY FATHER IS TO BE CARRIED AWAY TO THIS FEARFUL PLACE
I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE,--OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
HE AND I HOWEVER SPENT THUS ONE DAY LONGER IN SWEET FRIENDSHIP
HERE IS WHERE YOU ARE TO SLEEP
I COULD NOT DISINHERIT HIM
UNNECESSARILY DISAGREEABLE I SHOULD HAVE SAID
WITH JACK I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE QUARRELLED ALTOGETHER AND VERY GRIEVOUS IT WAS TO ME NOT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE LAD OF A MORNING OR AN EVENING
BUT WHY I ASKED SHOULD THESE FOOLISH BOYS DISCUSS THE SERIOUS QUESTION RESPECTING YOUR DEAR FATHER IN THE PUBLIC STREET THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE HIM--DEPOSITED SHE SAID ALMOST SOBBING AS SHE SPOKE
THEY LOOKED LIKE TWO STOUT MINERVAS WITH HUGE WICKER HELMETS
BUT IT IS CONSIDERED IN THE INTERESTS OF HUMANITY TO BE SO ESSENTIAL THAT THIS SCHEME OF THE FIXED PERIOD SHALL NOT BE CARRIED OUT THAT H.M
I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PRESENTLY THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING TO BE SAID,--SOME CAUSE FOR A QUARREL
IT CANNOT BUT BE THAT A SCHEME WITH SUCH POWER TO CHANGE,--AND I MAY SAY TO IMPROVE,--THE MANNERS AND HABITS OF MANKIND SHOULD BE KNOWN IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH A PORTION OF THE INHABITANTS DO AT ANY RATE READ AND WRITE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE YOU WOULD WANT
HOW MANY THINGS ARE REQUISITE TO TRUE GREATNESS
THEY HAD BROUGHT THEIR DR MACNUFFERY AND OUR LADS IMMEDIATELY FOUND THE NEED OF HAVING A DOCTOR OF THEIR OWN
THAT THESE EVILS WOULD HAVE BEFALLEN CRASWELLER HIMSELF THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
JACK WOULD DO TWICE MORE FOR EVA CRASWELLER THAN FOR YOU OR ME AND IT'S NATURAL HE SHOULD
THEN EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CHANGE AND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX BADE ME MAKE MYSELF QUITE AT HOME
IT WOULD BE AS BAD THEY SAID AS THE CANNIBALS OF NEW ZEALAND THAT SHOWS THE ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE OF THE BISHOPS ON THE SUBJECT I DARESAY
I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I AM STANDING ON MY HEAD OR MY HEELS
ON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC SAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND I HAD EVER STOOD UP FOR THE DIGNITIES OF MY POSITION
THEY HELD THE MEETING ON THE TOWN FLAGS AND MANY ELOQUENT WORDS WERE NO DOUBT SPOKEN
THAT MOMENT WHEN HE KNOCKED DOWN SIR KENNINGTON OVAL'S WICKET HAD I NOT BEEN AS PROUD AS HE WAS
I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE ALL THE SCENES OF THAT DAY NOR THE GROWING ANXIETY OF THE ENGLISHMEN AS JACK WENT ON WITH ONE HUNDRED AFTER ANOTHER
IT WAS ALL EVA'S DOING
THERE WERE MANY WHO LOOKED FORWARD TO IT AS THE CREATOR OF A NEW IDEA OF WEALTH AND COMFORT
SHALL WE WALK DOWN TO THE HOUSE HE SAID
THAT GREAT BRITAIN IS MUCH STRONGER THAN BRITANNULA NONE OF US CAN DOUBT
I DOUBT WHETHER THERE WAS ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD HAVE EARNED HIS BREAD IN A COUNTING-HOUSE UNLESS IT WAS STUMPS THE PROFESSIONAL
BUT WHEN YOU COME TO KILLING POOR MR CRASWELLER IN REAL LIFE IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION AND THEN WHEN I BEGAN TO EXPLAIN TO HER AT LENGTH THE IMMENSE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT SHE ONLY REMARKED THAT THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE ASSEMBLY
THEN THE STEAM-BOWLER WAS RIDDEN INTO ITS PLACE BY THE ATTENDANT ENGINEER AND JACK BEGAN HIS WORK
SIR KENNINGTON WAS A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG ARISTOCRAT WITH PLENTY OF WORDS BUT NOTHING SPECIAL TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
WE HAD ALREADY INTRODUCED THE HABIT OF TATTOOING ON THE BACKS OF THE BABIES THE DAY ON WHICH THEY WERE BORN
ALTHOUGH OUGHT I NOT TO WISH THAT I MIGHT BE STRUCK DEAD HE SAID
YOUNG GRUNDLE WILL NEVER KNOW HALF AS MUCH ABOUT SHEEP IN SPITE OF HIS CONCEIT
HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LANDS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH FIVE OR SIX MILES FROM GLADSTONOPOLIS AND SHOWED GREAT JUDGMENT IN THE SELECTION
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CATAPULTS WAS INTRUSTED TO ONE MAN AFTER ANOTHER,--BUT IN VAIN
I LITTLE THOUGHT WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AS BEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WITH MY WIFE ON HIS LEFT I SHOULD EVER SPEND MORE THAN A MONTH ON BOARD THE SHIP OR WRITE ON BOARD IT THIS ACCOUNT OF ALL MY THOUGHTS AND ALL MY TROUBLES IN REGARD TO THE FIXED PERIOD
AND YOU OH MY FRIEND HAVE EVER BEEN HE WHOM IT HAS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY TO HAVE HAD WITH ME AS THE SHARER OF MY ASPIRATIONS BUT I AM NINE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU ARE I AGAIN PASSED BY THE ONE YEAR ADDED TO MY AGE
A SON WILL NOT LIKE YOU SAY TO LEAD HIS FATHER INTO THE COLLEGE
THE FIXED PERIOD WAS NOT AGAIN MENTIONED WHILE HE WAS ON BOARD
I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SINCERE FRIEND TO GRAYBODY THOUGH HE WAS INDEED A MAN VERY DIFFICULT TO BEFRIEND
THAT COLLEGE WILL BECOME A MADHOUSE
HAD I NOT PROMISED TO GO TO-DAY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE OH JOHN SAID SHE I THINK THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PUT UP TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE THANKS
BUT CRASWELLER DID NOT AS IT SEEMED INTEND TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THESE WHISPERS
THERE SEEMED TO BE AN OPINION THAT JACK WOULD EITHER SHOW HIMSELF AT ONCE UNEQUAL TO THE OCCASION AND IMMEDIATELY BE PUT OUT,--WHICH OPINION I THINK THAT ALL GLADSTONOPOLIS WAS INCLINED TO HOLD,--OR ELSE THAT HE WOULD GET HIS EYE IN AS HE CALLED IT AND GO ON AS LONG AS THE THREE OTHERS COULD KEEP THEIR BATS
WELL--YES
AND EACH AS HE DREW NEARER TO THE HAPPY DAY WOULD BE TREATED WITH STILL INCREASING HONOUR
NOR WAS IT FOR ME TO DECLARE THAT THE VICTIMS OF THE FIRST YEAR SHOULD BE FORGIVEN
DON'T SAY THAT MR NEVERBEND WHISPERED EVA
THERE WERE MANY THERE WHO HAD BEEN GLAD TO SEE A SHIP OF WAR COME IN TO STOP THE FIXED PERIOD BUT HARDLY ONE WHO WAS PLEASED TO LOSE HIS OWN INDEPENDENCE
NOW I HAVE MY HOPES WHICH I OWN SEEM HIGH AND I SHALL BE ABLE TO WATCH FROM DAY TO DAY THE WAY IN WHICH MY ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE FIXED PERIOD ARE RECEIVED BY THE BRITISH PUBLIC
MRS NEVERBEND HAD NEVER MADE HERSELF PROMINENT BEFORE IN ANY PUBLIC QUESTION
HE IS A HIGH-SPIRITED GOOD BOY
INCLUDING THE CHAPLAIN AND THE SURGEON THERE WERE TWELVE OF THEM AND SHE ASKED TWELVE OF THE PRETTIEST GIRLS IN GLADSTONOPOLIS TO MEET THEM
THEY WERE ALL AS CHILDREN SKIPPING ABOUT THE WORLD IN THEIR FOOLISH PLAYFUL IGNORANCE WHOM IT WAS THE SAILOR'S DUTY TO PROTECT
DO HAVE DONE WITH YOUR FIXED PERIOD AND NONSENSE SHE HAD SAID TO ME ONLY YESTERDAY
YES MR PRESIDENT
MY HEALTH WAS GOOD AND I HAD AMPLE SCOPE FOR MY ENERGIES THEN EVEN AS NOW
HE KNEW THAT MY OBJECT WAS TO DO GOOD THOUGH HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE GOOD TO BE DONE
BUT JACK SAID THAT HE WAS VERY LITTLE GOOD AT THE GAME
I NEVER CARED TWOPENCE WHETHER THE OLD FELLOWS WERE DEPOSITED OR NOT BUT I DO THINK THAT IF YOUR OWN TIME HAD COME NEAR I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IT MUCH WHY NOT
THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER
BUT SHE INTERRUPTED ME AGAIN BEFORE I COULD GET OUT A WORD
AND POOR JACK WHEN HIS SHORT TRIUMPH WAS OVER WOULD HAVE TO REFLECT THAT THOUGH FORTUNATE IN HIS CRICKET HE WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS LOVE
I SHALL NOT AGAIN LEAVE MY HOME TILL I HAVE TO LEAVE IT FOR THE LAST TIME
GRUNDLE HAD BEEN HEARD TO DECLARE MOST AUTHORITATIVELY THAT WHEN THE DAY CAME CRASWELLER SHOULD BE DEPOSITED AND HAD GIVEN IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THE POWER DID NOT EXIST WHICH COULD WITHSTAND THE LAW OF BRITANNULA
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU FIRST KNEW ME IN BRITANNULA AND HAVE SINCE PASSED A MONTH WITH ME AT SEA
THE LONG HOURS OF ENFORCED IDLENESS ON BOARD SHIP WOULD SUFFICE TO ENABLE ME TO SIFT HIS OBJECTIONS WHICH SEEMED AT THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT TO RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO THE IMPATIENCE NECESSARY TO A YEAR'S QUIESCENCE
NOTHING SAID EVA
IT IS NOW DUE TO THE FEELINGS WHICH FILL NO DOUBT THE BOSOMS OF THESE TWO ANTI-FIXED-PERIOD SENIORS THAT THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIXED PERIOD HAS FOR A TIME BEEN QUENCHED IN BRITANNULA
I WAS PREPARED BUT I COULD NOT CARRY THE PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY WITH ME
BUT THE TIME WOULD SOON COME WHEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEVOTE TRANQUIL HOURS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE POINTS WHICH HE HAD RAISED
AND I FELT THAT THE OLD COUNTRY WHICH HAD REALLY NOTHING ON EARTH TO DO WITH THE MATTER COULD NOT INTERFERE WITH AN OPINION EXPRESSED SO STRONGLY
IF NOT I SHALL HAVE A GRIEVANCE IN THEIR PARSIMONY WHICH IN ITSELF WILL BE A COMFORT TO ME
THE CHIMNEYS AND THE FURNACES MAY PERHAPS BE USED I REPLIED
FIVE REPUBLICAN MINERVAS RAN AFTER IT AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM
I SIMPLY BOWED TO HIM
I DID NOT FIND THAT I HAD RECONCILED MYSELF TO THE USE OF THIS COVETOUSNESS WITH THE OBJECT OF ACHIEVING A PURPOSE WHICH I BELIEVED TO BE THOROUGHLY GOOD
ALL THAT GOES FOR NOTHING AND UNFORTUNATELY SAID I AS THOUGH CLENCHING THE MATTER THE BIBLE EXISTS IN WHICH YOUR FATHER ENTERED THE DATE WITH HIS USUAL EXEMPLARY ACCURACY THEN HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH HAVING NO FURTHER EVIDENCE TO OFFER
SIR FERDINANDO BROWN IS NOW YOUR GOVERNOR A FACT WHICH IN ITSELF IS STRONG EVIDENCE
TWO OR THREE DAYS MORE WOULD SEE THEIR GALLANT SHIP STEAM OUT OF THE HARBOUR
AND IF HE GOES ON LIVING AT SYDNEY LET US SAY ON THE FAT OF THE LAND,--DRAWING ALL THE INCOME AND LEAVING THE TRUSTEES AS LEGAL OWNERS,--WHERE SHOULD I BE THEN IN THAT CASE SAID I HAVING TAKEN TWO OR THREE MINUTES FOR CONSIDERATION,--"IN THAT CASE I PRESUME THE PROPERTY WOULD BE CONFISCATED BY LAW AND WOULD GO TO HIS NATURAL HEIR
AND WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT I DID SO THROUGH PRIDE I FOUND IT VERY HARD TO BEAR
BUT IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE OLD MEN ARE STILL ALIVE IN ENGLAND THAT THE YOUNG IN BRITANNULA ARE TO BE AFFLICTED,--THE YOUNG AND THE OLD AS WELL
AND AS FOR A FOREIGNER,--WE DON'T CALL YOU FOREIGNERS WHY NOT SAID I RATHER ANXIOUS TO PROVE THAT WE WERE FOREIGNERS
EVA IS A MERE CHILD
AS I NOW WRITE THIS IS WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY DONE AND HISTORY WILL HAVE TO TELL THE STORY
CRASWELLER HAS GONE AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING WITHOUT HIM THIS WAS TRUE AND I THEREFORE PREPARED TO DESCEND THE HILL
WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH ME WE SHALL PUT YOU ON SHORE AT PLYMOUTH AND SEND YOU UP TO LONDON--WITH A GUARD OF HONOUR AND WHAT WILL THE GUARD OF HONOUR DO WITH ME AH
YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE LAW AS IT STANDS NOW I SAID
I AM ASTONISHED AT THE STRENGTH OF MY OWN MIND IN THAT I DID NOT GO MAD
MY OWN SON HAD TAKEN UPON HIMSELF THIS NEW WORK OF PUBLIC SPEECHIFYING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO HIS OWN FATHER
CRASWELLER SAT PERFECTLY SPEECHLESS BY MY SIDE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SIR LORDS HAD ONLY ENDEAVOURED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF MY PRESENCE
I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING-STOCK OF THE PEOPLE
HE'D HAVE KILLED THAT OLD FELLOW THAT CAME ON BOARD AS SURE AS EGGS IF WE HADN'T GOT THERE JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT HIM NOT WITH HIS OWN HANDS SAID A LISTENING JUNIOR
AT ANY RATE HE HAD AGREED WITH ME AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD SAYING HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE IF HE COULD BE DEPOSITED AT FIFTY-EIGHT AND HAD ALWAYS DECLARED HOW BLESSED MUST BE THE TIME WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE COME FOR HIMSELF AND HIS OLD WIFE
THERE WAS NOW BUT THE ONE HOPE LEFT
I DOUBT WHETHER IN THE ANNALS OF CRICKET ANY RECORD IS MADE OF A BETTER INNINGS THAN THAT
JACK WAS DETERMINED NOT TO GO TO THE EASTERN ALPS THIS YEAR
AND THE MODE OF LIFE AT THE COLLEGE HAD BEEN SETTLED
AND THEN THEY WILL COME SO QUICKLY THAT WE MUST SOON SEE TO GET OTHER LODGINGS FINISHED
THIS I DID THINK WAS A TRIUMPH
I NOW REQUIRE THAT HE SHALL PROCEED TO NEW ZEALAND THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW
WHEN THE BRITANNULISTS WENT IN FOR THE SECOND TIME THEY HAD 1500 RUNS TO GET
THOUGH THE HOPE WAS POOR IT SEEMED AT PRESENT TO BE MY ONLY HOPE
LOOKING AT THE MATTER MERELY ON BEHALF OF JACK IT APPEARED TO ME THAT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WOULD IN THAT CASE BE QUITE SAFE LET CRASWELLER BE DEPOSITED,--OR RUN AWAY TO SYDNEY
IT WAS A WAY OUT OF MY IMMEDIATE TROUBLE AGAINST WHICH I WAS ABLE TO EXPOSTULATE AND TO SHOW WITH SOME TRUTH ON MY SIDE THAT I WAS AN INJURED MAN
SHOULD I NOT ABSOLUTELY FAIL
HE AGREED TO IT BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM AND BECAUSE YOU WERE A MAN ABLE TO PERSUADE
AND WHEN SHE WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE IN EARNEST SHE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON US THE ONE ARGUMENT THAT COULD HAVE FORCE AND SENT TO OUR HARBOUR HER 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER
I WAS ENCOUNTERED NOT ONLY IN MY OWN HOUSE BUT IN SOCIETY GENERALLY AND ON THE VERY STREETS OF GLADSTONOPOLIS BY THE EXPRESSION OF AN OPINION THAT CRASWELLER WOULD NOT BE MADE TO RETIRE TO THE COLLEGE AT HIS FIXED PERIOD
WE SAT DOWN THIRTY-SIX TO DINNER
BUT AS AT THAT MOMENT MY LUGGAGE WAS BROUGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH THE VIEW OF BEING TAKEN ON BOARD SHIP THE MAN THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE AS WELL AND MUCH EASIER TO FOLLOW THE LUGGAGE
EXORS THE LAWYER WILL BE THE FOURTH
AS GREAT BRITAIN CANNOT AND WILL NOT PERMIT THE FIXED PERIOD TO BE CARRIED OUT AMONG ANY ENGLISH-SPEAKING RACE OF PEOPLE HOW ABOUT THE UNITED STATES SAID A VOICE
WELL;--YES I AM AFRAID SO
IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO COME WITH YOU I COULD SEE THAT YOU ALWAYS PUT IT ON RIGHTLY
BUT OUR FIRST OBJECT MUST BE TO DEPOSIT CRASWELLER AND BARNES AND TALLOWAX SO THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD BE ACCUSTOMED TO THE FASHION OF DEPOSITING THE AGED
WHEN MY WIFE SAID BOTHER IT WAS I WAS AWARE OF NO USE TO ARGUE WITH HER
BUT THEN IT HAD OCCURRED ALSO THAT NONE MIGHT PERHAPS FOLLOW ME WHEN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I SHOULD HAVE DEPARTED
ON THE LAST DAY FEELINGS WERE CARRIED TO A PITCH WHICH WAS MORE BEFITTING THE LAST BATTLE OF A GREAT WAR,--SOME WATERLOO OF OTHER AGES,--THAN THE FINISHING OF A PROLONGED GAME OF CRICKET
GUNBOAT JOHN BRIGHT,--FOR THE TYRANNICAL SLAVES OF A MODERN MONARCH HAVE TAKEN ME IN THE FLESH AND ARE CARRYING ME OFF TO ENGLAND SO THAT AS THEY SAY ALL THAT NONSENSE OF A FIXED PERIOD MAY DIE AWAY IN BRITANNULA
WE UNDERSTAND THAT MISS CRASWELLER IS TO HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE
BUT I HAD MUCH TO DO BEFORE NOON ON THE FOLLOWING DAY BUT VERY LITTLE TIME IN WHICH TO DO IT
BUT HE WAS THE SULTAN'S VIZIER AND HAVING THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SHIP ALTOGETHER IN HIS OWN HANDS WAS TO MY THINKING ITS VERY MASTER
I HAD ALREADY OBSERVED THAT HE NEVER SPOKE ABOUT THE FIXED PERIOD IN OUR HOUSE THOUGH IN THE CONDITION IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY THEN WAS HE MUST HAVE HEARD IT DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE
THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER STRUGGLES TO PROLONG THE TIME OF MISERY WHICH NATURE HAD HERSELF PRODUCED
THINK HOW STRONG MUST HAVE BEEN THE FACTS AGAINST YOU WHEN THEY HAVE HAD THIS EFFECT
I WAS LOST IN A MAZE OF WONDERMENT AS I ATTEMPTED TO LOOK AT THE PROCEEDING ALL ROUND
A THRONE A LORD AND A BISHOP STILL REMAIN TO ENCUMBER THE EARTH
BUT THE OCCUPANTS OF THE BENCHES BEFORE HIM SAT STERNLY SILENT
THE MORE I THOUGHT OF EVA AND THE FLOCKS THE MORE DETERMINED WAS I NOT TO ALLOW THE PERSONAL INTERESTS OF MY BOY,--AND THEREFORE MY OWN,--TO CLASH IN ANY WAY WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF MY PUBLIC DUTIES
I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MR PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUARTER OF THE WORLD THINGS WERE PROGRESSING CAPTAIN BATTLEAX PRETTY WELL BEFORE THIS MORNING
SIR FERDINANDO HAVING SAT DOWN GOT UP AGAIN AND SHOOK ME WARMLY BY THE HAND
WHY SHOULD YOU OBJECT TO BE CREMATED MR PUDDLEBRANE SAID I WHETHER LIKE A BIG PIG OR OTHERWISE
NOT FOR CRASWELLER OR BARNES OR TALLOWAX WILL THIS THING BE GOOD,--NOR FOR THOSE OLD WOMEN WHO ARE ALREADY LYING ABOUT THEIR AGES IN THEIR COTTAGES,--NOR FOR MYSELF WHO AM I KNOW TOO APT TO BOAST OF MYSELF THAT EVEN THOUGH OLD AGE SHOULD COME UPON ME I MAY BE ABLE TO AVOID THE WORST OF ITS EFFECTS
HE WAS ALWAYS COURTEOUS TO ME AND WOULD OFFER ME TEA AND TOAST WHEN I CAME WITH A STATELY CIVILITY AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO SUBJECT OF BURNING DISCORD BETWEEN US
I HAD THOUGHT HIM TO BE A LITTLE WANTING IN THAT REVERENCE WHICH HE OWED TO HIS ELDERS AND TO BE MOREOVER SOMEWHAT OVER-FOND OF MONEY
BUT WHEN I HAD TURNED ON MY ROAD TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND WAS PREPARED TO THROW MYSELF INTO CRASWELLER'S ARMS THE IDEA OF GALILEO AND COLUMBUS AND THEIR ULTIMATE SUCCESS AGAIN FILLED MY BOSOM
JACK I PERCEIVED WAS QUITE AT HOME THERE
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT I WOULD BELIEVE
BUT YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT IT HAS BEEN OUR INTENTION TO INTERFERE WITH THAT WHICH YOU MUST REGARD AS THE PERFORMANCE OF A DUTY IT IS A DUTY SAID I
THIS WAS STUMPS ONE OF THE PROFESSIONALS WHO WAS NOT QUITE SO MUCH LIKE A MINERVA THOUGH HE TOO WAS PRODIGIOUSLY GREAVED
WHAT WOULD SHE BE IN LONDON WHY SHOULD NOT MR CRASWELLER'S DAUGHTER BE AS MUCH ADMIRED IN LONDON AS HERE I ANSWERED
AT ANY RATE I DID MAKE THE PROMISE AND GAVE THESE TWO GENTLEMEN MY WORD THAT I WOULD BE PRESENT THERE IN MY OWN ROOM IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS AT THE SAME HOUR ON THE DAY BUT ONE FOLLOWING
NOT THAT THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIXED PERIOD WAS IN ITSELF WRONG BUT THAT IT WAS IMPRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF THE HORRORS ATTENDING ITS LAST MOMENTS
EAT O SHEEP AND YOU WILL LOVE THE FOOD IN GOOD TIME,--YOU OR THE LAMBS THAT ARE COMING AFTER YOU
BY THIS TIME WE HAD BEEN JOINED BY SOME EIGHT OR TEN CARRIAGES WHICH FORMED AS IT WERE A FUNERAL CORTEGE BEHIND US
IN EVERY WAY ENGLAND HAD HAD REASON TO BE PROUD OF HER YOUNGEST CHILD
CRASWELLER I SAID ADDRESSING HIM WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY
YOU KNOW WHAT EXORS IS AND THERE IS THAT POOR MAN BARNES HAS GONE ALTOGETHER OUT OF HIS MIND AND HAS BECOME A DRIVELLING IDIOT THEY TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS A RAGING LUNATIC
YOU THINK THAT HE WILL COME ON THE THIRTIETH SAID GRAYBODY AS HE TOOK MY HAND AT PARTING
THE PERIOD WHICH WE HAD THEN CONTEMPLATED AT A DISTANCE HAD COME ROUND AND CRASWELLER HAD SECEDED WOFULLY
EVA CRASWELLER WAS THE QUEEN OF THE EVENING AND WAS AS JOYOUS AS BEAUTIFUL AND AS HIGH-SPIRITED AS A QUEEN SHOULD EVER BE
BUT JACK HAD DECLARED THAT MORNING THAT HE COULD NOT HIT A BALL IN A WEEK OF SUNDAYS HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE JACK HAD WHISPERED
SO IT IS
NOW SHE IS LIKE MY OWN CHILD I AM SURE THAT I CAN SAY THE SAME OF JACK YES
LET US TEACH THE WORLD SO TO LOOK FORWARD WITH LONGING EYES AND NOT WITH A FAINT HEART
AND THE TWELVE SOLDIERS MARCHED OFF TO SEE MY PORTMANTEAUS PUT SAFELY ON BOARD THE JOHN BRIGHT
THEY BOAST INDEED THAT NOT A MAN OR A WOMAN IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS IS NOW IGNORANT OF HIS LETTERS
WHAT WAS THE JOHN BRIGHT TO ME THAT IT SHOULD COME THERE PREPARED TO SEND ME INTO ETERNITY BY ITS BLOODTHIRSTY MECHANISM
AT EIGHT THE HALL WAS AGAIN FULL TO OVERFLOWING
IN YOUR COMPANY I FIRST LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN THIS PROJECT AND FOR YEARS WE HAVE AGREED THAT IN IT IS TO BE FOUND THE BEST MEANS FOR REMEDYING THE CONDITION OF MANKIND I HAD NOT FELT THEN WHAT IT IS TO BE TREATED AS ONE WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD DOES EVA TREAT YOU SO YES
AND IF THE WORDS OF ANY ONE WOULD HAVE AVAILED TO MAKE ME YIELD I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERS AS NOW SPOKEN
I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO VENTILATE THEM IN ENGLAND AND SEE WHAT THE PEOPLE THERE MAY SAY ABOUT THEM YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME MY CHILD HOW COULD I BE ANGRY WITH YOU
IT WAS NOW NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK AND I HAD OUT MY TRICYCLE IN ORDER TO GO DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
I TALKED ABOUT THE SHIP THAT HAD STARTED ON ITS HOMEWARD JOURNEY AND PRAISED LORD MARYLEBONE AND LAUGHED AT MR PUDDLEBRANE
I KNOW ALL THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH HE HAS FORTIFIED HIMSELF
AND I HEARD THAT VERY MANY OF THE INHABITANTS WENT AWAY GREATLY DISPLEASED IN THAT THEY COULD NOT BE ACCOMMODATED
HAD OUR FIRST HERO BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS BUSINESS BY OLD AGE--HAD HE BECOME DOTING OVER ITS DETAILS--PARSIMONIOUS OR EXTRAVAGANT OR EVEN SHORT-SIGHTED IN HIS SPECULATIONS--PUBLIC FEELING THAN WHICH NOTHING IS MORE IGNORANT WOULD HAVE RISEN IN FAVOUR OF THE FIXED PERIOD
THE IDEA WILL STILL LIVE AND IN AGES TO COME MEN WILL PROSPER AND BE STRONG AND THRIVE UNPOLLUTED BY THE GREED AND COWARDICE OF SECOND CHILDHOOD BECAUSE JOHN NEVERBEND WAS AT ONE TIME PRESIDENT OF BRITANNULA
GUNBOAT THE JOHN BRIGHT
GALILEO AND COLUMBUS,--GALILEO AND COLUMBUS
HE HAS NOT THREE IDEAS IN THE WORLD
I WILL NOT SAY THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THE SAME AT YOUR AGE IF EVA HAD ASKED ME
BUT TALLOWAX THE GROCER IN HIGH STREET WILL BE UP HERE BY THAT TIME
A FULL YEAR WOULD NO DOUBT SUFFICE FOR HIM TO ARRANGE HIS WORLDLY AFFAIRS AND TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER MARRIED
WAS I NOT IN THE POSITION OF A SHEPHERD DRIVING SHEEP INTO A PASTURE WHICH WAS DISTASTEFUL TO THEM
WHEN A PARTY OF US THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED IN NUMBER FIRST EMIGRATED FROM NEW ZEALAND TO BRITANNULA WE WERE ALMOST ALL OF US YOUNG PEOPLE
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO THROW MYSELF BACK AND REMAIN TRANQUIL
EVERYTHING THAT HUMAN NATURE WANTS WAS THERE AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
OF COURSE A PROMISE HAS BEEN MADE
I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED BRING JACK AND HIS LOVE INTO THIS DISPUTE SAID I
MY HEART THROBBED WITH PLEASUREABLE EMOTION AS I HEARD THAT OLD AGE WHICH I WAS MYSELF APPROACHING DEPICTED IN TERMS WHICH MADE ITS IMPOTENCE TRULY CONSPICUOUS,--TILL I FELT THAT HAD IT BEEN PROPOSED TO DEPOSIT ALL OF US WHO HAD REACHED THE AGE OF FIFTY-EIGHT I REALLY THINK THAT I SHOULD JOYFULLY HAVE GIVEN MY ASSENT TO SUCH A MEASURE AND HAVE WALKED OFF AT ONCE AND DEPOSITED MYSELF IN THE COLLEGE
I SUPPOSE YOU'D TAKE ALL THEIR PROPERTY EVERY STICK OF IT BUT PROPERTY IS A THING WHICH CAN BE CONVEYED AWAY WE SHOULD KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT UPON THEMSELVES
SHOULD I ABANDON IT ALL TAKE THE GOOD THINGS WITH WHICH GOD HAD PROVIDED ME AND RETIRE INTO PRIVATE LIFE
AND IMMEDIATELY ON HIS SITTING DOWN THERE GOT UP A GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I HAD NOT BEEN INTRODUCED BEFORE THIS DAY AND GAVE THE HEALTH OF MRS NEVERBEND AND THE LADIES OF BRITANNULA
FOR THOUGH THE MATCH HAD NOT YET BEEN ALTOGETHER BROKEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE DIFFERED ALTOGETHER ON THE QUESTION OF THE OLD MAN'S DEPOSITION
HE HAD CONVINCED ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG IN THE DETAILS OF MY SYSTEM
BUT AS I CONTINUED TO SAY TO MYSELF I WAS TO BE BANISHED IN A FEW HOURS AS ONE WHOSE INTENDED CRUELTIES WERE TOO ABOMINABLE TO ALLOW OF MY REMAINING IN MY OWN COUNTRY
HOLD YOUR TONGUE PERCY SAID AN ELDER OFFICER
MR NEVERBEND I TELL YOU THIS,--YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM I HOPE YOU LOVE JACK OH SHE EXCLAIMED AND IN A MOMENT SHE WAS IN MY ARMS AND I WAS KISSING HER
THE FEELING THAT IT MUST COME THOUGH IT CAME AT THE SAME TIME SO SLOWLY AND YET SO FAST
IT HAS BEEN DECIDED BY THE LAW
AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE UNREASONABLE IT DID APPEAR THAT I WHO HAD COMMITTED NO OFFENCE AGAINST ANY LAW SHOULD BE FORCED ON BOARD THE JOHN BRIGHT
BUT HE SEEMED TO THINK VERY LITTLE OF JACK'S PRECISE MACHINE
AND WHERE SHOULD I BE THEN
YES MY DEAR I KNOW YOU ARE
HOW OFTEN I FELT IN THESE DAYS THAT THERE IS A FORTITUDE NEEDED BY MAN MUCH GREATER THAN THAT OF JEOPARDISING HIS LIFE
AND HOW OFTEN BEFORE A TRUTH WAS BROUGHT TO MATURITY MUST IT BE NECESSARY THAT HE WHO HAD IMAGINED IT AND SEEN IT AND PLANNED IT MUST GIVE HIS VERY LIFE FOR IT AND ALL IN VAIN
THERE ISN'T ANY ONE WHO DOESN'T PAY HIM THE MOST PROFOUND RESPECT AND HE'S ALWAYS DOING GOOD TO EVERYBODY
IT HAS THEREFORE SENT ME OUT TO ASSUME THE REINS AND TO UNDERTAKE THE POWER AND TO BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING YOUR GOVERNOR DURING A SHORT TERM OF YEARS
I FOUND THAT I THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WAS ACTUALLY FORBIDDEN TO GO DOWN IN MY TRICYCLE TO MY OLD FRIEND'S HOUSE UNLESS I WOULD DO SO BEFORE NOON
TO ME PERSONALLY AN EXTREME OF COURTESY WAS SHOWN
BUT THE HEARTFELT CONVICTION HAD NOT BEEN STRONG WITH THE PEOPLE
THOUGH THE WIFE OF MY BOSOM AND THE SON OF MY LOINS SHOULD TURN AGAINST ME AND EMBITTER MY LAST MOMENTS BY THEIR ENMITY STILL WOULD I PERSEVERE
THE NAME HAD ALWAYS BEEN DISTASTEFUL TO ME AS I HAD NEVER WISHED TO JOIN WITH IT THE FEELING OF DEATH
HAD THEY BEEN AMONG US AND HAD WE BEEN ALLOWED TO USE OUR WISDOM WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM EFFETE OLD AGE WHERE WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HUMAN NATURE SHOULD ENDURE SUCH A STRUGGLE AND NOT REBEL
WHAT IS IT
BUT I HAD TOLD HIM FRANKLY THAT WE IN BRITANNULA HAD ALL BEEN TOO MUCH IN A HURRY AND HAD FOOLISHLY ENDEAVOURED TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEM IN OPPOSITION TO THE WORLD'S PREJUDICES WHICH SYSTEM WHEN SUCCESSFUL MUST PERVADE THE ENTIRE WORLD
AND I AM BOUND TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE IN MANY RESPECTS SHOWN YOURSELVES FIT FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY IMPOSED UPON YOU
I SUGGESTED SIXTY
IT WAS NOW MID-WINTER AND IT WANTED JUST TWELVE MONTHS TO THAT 30TH OF JUNE ON WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL OUR PLANS CRASWELLER WAS TO BE DEPOSITED
BUT UPON ME MY FELLOW-CITIZENS HAS FALLEN THE GREAT DISGRACE OF HAVING ROBBED YOU OF YOUR INDEPENDENCE HERE A MURMUR RAN THROUGH THE HALL DECLARING THAT THIS WAS NOT SO
WE WERE NOW NEARLY THROUGH MARCH AND THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE WAS THE DAY ON WHICH HE OUGHT TO BE LED TO THE COLLEGE
BUT THOUGH I HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO ORIGINATE THE IDEA I HAVE NOT BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE TERRIBLE HARSHNESS OF THE OPINIONS OF THOSE AROUND ME WHEN I SHOULD HAVE EXERCISED AGAINST THOSE DEAR TO ME THE MANDATES OF THE NEW LAW
YOU HAVE GOT NASTY MURDEROUS THOUGHTS IN YOUR MIND AND WANT TO KILL POOR MR CRASWELLER JUST OUT OF PRIDE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID YOU WOULD
YOU COULD LEAD ME AWAY AND DEPOSIT ME WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BECAUSE I AM NOT POPULAR
EARLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING I HAD JACK INTO MY DRESSING-ROOM AND SAID GOOD-BYE TO HIM
I COULD NOT THINK THAT HE WAS SO VAIN SO GREEDY SO SELFISH AND SO UNPATRIOTIC
THERE WAS A CRUELTY IN IT,--AN INHOSPITALITY,--WHICH IN SPITE OF THE EXIGENCIES OF THE GAME WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN
I'LL LEAVE YOU SAID JACK
IF HE DON'T THINK MUCH OF THE GIRL HE MUST THINK SOMETHING OF THE SHEEP NOT THINK MUCH OF THE GIRL
IT CONCERNS LIFE AND DEATH,--THAT IS A MATTER OF COURSE,--AND IT IS THE LIFE AND DEATH OF YOUR MOST INTIMATE FRIEND OF EVA'S FATHER OF HIM WHO YEARS SINCE CAME HITHER WITH YOU FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND HAS LIVED WITH YOU THROUGH ALL THE STRUGGLES AND ALL THE SUCCESSES OF A LONG CAREER
STUMPS WAS A THICK-SET SOLID SOLEMN-LOOKING MAN WHO HAD BEEN RIDICULED BY OUR SIDE AS BEING MUCH TOO OLD FOR THE GAME
HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS SYMPATHETIC AND TOOK DELIGHT IN EXPATIATING ON ALL THOSE BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME TO THE WORLD FROM THE RACE OF MANKIND WHICH KNEW NOTHING OF THE DEBILITY OF OLD AGE
AND YET IT WAS A LIE WHICH BY ITS MERE TELLING MIGHT BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE
AND DO REMEMBER THAT AS YOU GET NEARER AND NEARER TO THAT CHILLY COUNTRY THE WEATHER WILL ALWAYS BE COLDER AND COLDER
BUT I WAS DETERMINED THAT I WOULD BE STERN
THIS WAS MR GRAYBODY THE CURATOR WHO HAD BEEN SPECIALLY APPOINTED TO OCCUPY A CERTAIN RESIDENCE TO LOOK AFTER THE GROUNDS AND TO KEEP THE BOOKS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
WE SHOULD THUS BE RID OF OUR OLD MEN AND OUR OBJECT WOULD BE SO FAR ATTAINED
WHAT WAS A FELLOW TO DO WHAT DID YOU DO I HAD IT ALL OUT WITH SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WHO IS THE PRINCE OF GOOD FELLOWS
IT'S A PITY THAT POOR EVA WHO IS A GOOD GIRL IN HER WAY SHOULD HAVE HER HEAD TURNED THIS CAME FROM MY WIFE
AS I THOUGHT OF IT I BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY NECESSARY FOR A MAN TO IMAGINE NEW TRUTHS BUT TO BE ABLE TO ENDURE AND TO SUFFER AND TO BRING THEM TO MATURITY
ARE SOLDIERS MURDERERS WHO KILL OTHER SOLDIERS IN BATTLE
THAT TEMPTATION TO THE YOUNG TO BEGRUDGE TO THE OLD THE COSTLY COMFORTS WHICH THEY COULD NOT EARN WOULD BE NO LONGER FOSTERED
ALL THIS MADE ME VERY MELANCHOLY BUT ESPECIALLY THE FEELING THAT I SHOULD BE REGARDED BY ALL AROUND AS A MONSTER OF CRUELTY
AND YET CRASWELLER WAS A DECLARED FIXED-PERIODIST
I SAW AT A GLANCE THAT I MUST WAIT TILL THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE AND POSTPONE ALL FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SUBJECT AS FAR AS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TILL GLADSTONOPOLIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO HER NATURAL QUIESCENCE AFTER THE DISTURBANCE OF THE CRICKET
EVA MY DEAR SAID MR CRASWELLER YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE US
I GAVE JACK GREAT CREDIT IN MY OWN MIND BECAUSE I FELT THAT AT THE MOMENT HE WAS MUCH DOWN AT HEART
THAT WILL BE HARD TO BEAR THE FIRST REFORMERS HAD TO BEAR SUCH HARDSHIPS
HE COLLECTS HIS REVENUE AND INFORMS US THAT TO BE TAXED IS THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE OF AN ORNATE CIVILISATION
BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW I TUMBLED INTO IT AND HOW EVA EGGED ME ON AND HOW THE NEARER THE THING CAME THE MORE I WAS BOUND TO FIGHT
WHILE LAND IN BRITANNULA WAS PLENTY NO ONE HAD CARED TO SELECT GROUND SO NEAR TO THOSE AWFUL FURNACES BY WHICH THE MORTAL CLAY SHOULD BE TRANSPORTED INTO THE AIR
SO YOU HAVE LEFT LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES IN CHARGE OF YOUR LITTLE TOY I WHISPERED TO CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
IN TELLING THIS HOWEVER I AM ADVANCING A LITTLE BEYOND THE POINT IN MY STORY TO WHICH I HAVE AS YET CARRIED MY READER
MRS NEVERBEND TOO ATE HER DINNER WITHOUT A WORD
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE ONE DAY WHICH AS A MATTER OF GRACE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO ME SIR FERDINANDO DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF MAKING A SPEECH TO THE PEOPLE OF GLADSTONOPOLIS
IT IS NOW NEARLY ELEVEN HALF-PAST TEN SAID THE CAPTAIN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH
IT WAS A MATTER WHICH REQUIRED LEGISLATIVE SANCTION IN WHATEVER COUNTRY MIGHT ADOPT IT
WHAT I HAD HEARD ABOUT THIS CRICKET-MATCH HAD GONE IN AT ONE EAR AND COME OUT AT THE OTHER
AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THE BRITISHERS WERE ALL OUT AND THE RUNS WERE NUMBERED IN FOUR FIGURES
LET THE VEIL OF ANNIHILATION FALL UPON THEM BEFORE THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
ALTHOUGH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG TO ASSIST IN DEPOSITING HIS FATHER-IN-LAW FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE HERD AND FLOCKS HIMSELF AS GRUNDLE WOULD HAVE DONE NEVERTHELESS HE WAS HARDLY BOUND BY ANY FEELINGS OF HONOUR OR CONSCIENCE TO KEEP OLD CRASWELLER AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO THE LAWS OF THE LAND
SO ONE OF OUR LOT IS TO COME BACK FOR A WIFE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID LORD MARYLEBONE AT OUR TABLE THE DAY BEFORE THE MATCH WAS TO BE PLAYED
HE MUST DO THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
CRASWELLER SAID I YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS AGREED TO THE LETTER ON THIS GREAT MATTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD HE LOOKED INTO MY FACE WITH SUPPLICATING WEAK EYES BUT HE SAID NOTHING
BETTER COULD NOT BE DONE IN THE MATTER THAN TO HAVE THEM BANISHED FROM THE TONGUE OF ALL THE WORLD AS I CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE SUBJECT VENTILATED WITHIN HEARING AND SPEAKING OF THE CROWD OF THOROUGHLY OLD-FASHIONED PREJUDICED ARISTOCRATIC YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WHO WERE COMING TO US
I AM GLAD TO FIND THAT A BRITANNULAN YOUNG LADY HAS BEEN SO EFFECTIVE
BRITANNULA HAS AGAIN BECOME ONE,--I DO NOT I OWN LOOK UPON HIM AS A GREAT STATESMAN
THERE WAS MUCH IN THAT WHICH HAD ANGERED ME
BUT HE WHO HARDLY ALLOWED ME HIS FATHER TO OPEN MY MOUTH WITHOUT CONTRADICTING ME AND WHO IN OUR HOUSE ORDERED EVERYTHING ABOUT JUST AS THOUGH HE WERE THE MASTER WAS SO BASHFUL IN THE GIRL'S PRESENCE THAT HE HAD NEVER AS YET ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE
BUT HERE WITH EVA THERE WOULD BE NO CUSTOM
BUT I MYSELF HAD NEVER LIKED HIM MUCH
ALL FEELING OF ANGER IS AT AN END
HOW WOULD IT BE WHEN THE TIME EVEN FOR DEPOSITING HAD COME AND AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO LEAD THE OLD MAN UP THROUGH THE STREETS OF GLADSTONOPOLIS
POSTLECOTT IS THE NEXT BUT THREE ON THE BOOKS AND IS GETTING VERY MELANCHOLY
MY DEAR SAID I THIS IS ALL VERY SUDDEN
I THINK THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME
HAD CRASWELLER DEPARTED AND HAD THE SYSTEM THEN BEEN STOPPED SHOULD I NOT HAVE APPEARED A MURDERER EVEN TO MYSELF
YOUR ASSEMBLY IN THE MAJESTY OF ITS WISDOM COULD DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
AS FAR AS I CAN READ THE WILL OF THE ALMIGHTY OR RATHER THE PROGRESS OF THE WAYS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FOR MAN TO ENDEAVOUR TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF MANKIND
AS TO YOUR EXACT AGE I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE RECORDS I BEGAN
UPON THE WHOLE I WAS GLAD THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT HAD COME INTO OUR WATERS AND HAD TAKEN ME AWAY ON ITS RETURN TO ENGLAND
IT WAS TRUE THAT AT SUCH A MOMENT I COULD NOT USE MY PARENTAL AUTHORITY TO SEND JACK OUT OF THE ISLAND
CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HE REGARDED AS THE SULTAN OF THE WORLD
THREE OR FOUR HAD DIED NATURALLY BUT CRASWELLER WAS ABOUT TO BE THE FIRST
I WONDER HOW YOU CAN BRING YOURSELF TO THINK OF KILLING THE POOR MAN WHOSE BREAD YOU HAVE SO OFTEN EATEN
EVEN IN BRITANNULA THE WORLD MIGHT BE TOO STRONG FOR ME
YOU MAY BE SURE THAT WHAT I SHALL SAY TO HIM WILL NOT BE ILL-NATURED
THE FIRST TASK WOULD BE THE EASIER BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO NECESSITY FOR ANY PAINFUL ALLUSION TO MY OWN WANT OF SUCCESS
TO PLOUGH ON ACROSS THE WAVES AND EITHER TO BE DROWNED OR SUCCEED
COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO FLY FROM HIS COUNTRY AND HER LAWS JUST AS THE TIME HAD ARRIVED WHEN THOSE LAWS MIGHT OPERATE UPON HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THAT COUNTRY
I SHALL HAVE A GLASS OF MADEIRA--JUST A THIMBLEFUL SAID ANOTHER WHO SEEMED TO BE A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN LORD ALFRED PERCY
BUT I HAD LONG FORESEEN THAT THE FIRST DEPOSITION SHOULD BE EFFECTED WITH SOME ECLAT OF VOLUNTARY GLORY
BUT THAT IS ALL AS IT SHOULD BE
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE HORRIFIED WERE ONE LIFE SACRIFICED TO THIS THEORY WE KNEW THAT,--WE KNEW THAT SAID THE VOICE OF TALLOWAX
IT IS BUT THREE MILES FOR US TO WALK I SAID
THE FIRST UNFORTUNATELY WAS SOON MADE TO RETIRE
YOU CAN'T TELL ME YET WHEN IT'S TO BE MR PRESIDENT
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ALL THE LOUD MUSIC OF THE TOWN BAND HAD STRUCK UP AT THE MOMENT WITH THEIR SHRILLEST NOTES
IT NOW WANTED BUT FOUR MONTHS TO HIS DEPOSITION
WHAT SAID THE POST-CARD THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME FOR MOUNT EARNSHAWE YET
AND BECAUSE YOU ARE IN LOVE YOU ARE TO THROW OVER--NOT MERELY YOUR FATHER BECAUSE IN SUCH AN AFFAIR THAT GOES FOR NOTHING OH BUT IT DOES
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER LOOKED MUCH TO THE PRINCIPLE WHICH I HAD IN VIEW
HE WASTES MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE AND BECOMES ON THE AGGREGATE AN INTOLERABLE BURDEN
AND IS NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH THOSE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS SAID THE SECRETARY PUTTING IN THE WORD BEAUTIFUL BY WAY OF FLATTERY TO MYSELF
ON THE TWO OTHERS SAT THOSE WHO OFFICIALLY SCORED THE GAME
AND THIS HE EFFECTED BY A FEW CURT WORDS WHICH I HAVE FOUND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST
II
I WILL NOW BEGIN MY TALE
HE SHOULD BE TROUBLED NO LONGER WITH LABOUR AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE TROUBLED NO LONGER WITH LIFE
I AS PRESIDENT OF COURSE TOOK NO PART IN IT
FEELINGS ARE CHANGEABLE I TOLD THEM AT THAT GREAT AND GLORIOUS MEETING WHICH WE HAD AT GLADSTONOPOLIS AND THOUGH NATURALLY GOVERNED ONLY BY INSTINCT WOULD BE TAUGHT AT LAST TO COMPLY WITH REASON
DO REMEMBER THAT
DON'T WE MR BUNNIT WHAT COULD I DO
OVER AFTER OVER JACK WENT ON AND RECEIVED EVERY BALL THAT WAS BOWLED
BUT ON THAT SUBJECT I SAID NOTHING
IF THERE WERE ANY SUCH FEELING I REGARD IT AS CERTAINLY MEAN
WHEREAS JACK IS DETERMINED TO STAND UP FOR HIM AS LONG AS HE HAS GOT A TONGUE TO SHOUT OR HANDS TO FIGHT THESE WERE TERRIBLE WORDS BUT I HAD HEARD THE SAME SENTIMENT MYSELF FROM JACK'S OWN LIPS
STUMPS WAS BOWLING FROM THE BRITISH CATAPULT AND VERY NEARLY GAVE JACK HIS QUIETUS DURING THE FIRST OVER
BUT ALL THIS I COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO HIM AND WAS OBLIGED SIMPLY TO TAKE IT AS A FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT JOIN AN ALPINE PARTY FOR MOUNT EARNSHAWE THIS YEAR
THE CITY WON'T LET YOU DO IT
BUT WAS I TO GIVE WAY AFTER ALL
SIR FERDINANDO AND I SAID THE CAPTAIN AS WE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WILL DO OURSELVES THE HONOUR OF CALLING ON YOU AT THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS TO-MORROW MORNING I WENT HOME TO BED WITH A PRESENTIMENT OF EVIL RUNNING ACROSS MY HEART
MY FATHER'S LIFE OR DEATH IS IN YOUR HANDS
BUT SUCH AN ESCAPE WOULD HAVE BEEN BELOW MY DIGNITY
IF A MAN BE DOING HIS DUTY LET HIM NOT THINK TOO MUCH OF THAT CONDITION OF MIND WHICH HE CALLS HAPPINESS
FROM THE GATES UP TO THE TEMPLE WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUNDS,--THAT TEMPLE IN WHICH THE LAST SCENE OF LIFE WAS TO BE ENCOUNTERED,--THERE RAN A BROAD GRAVEL PATH WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BECOME A BEAUTIFUL AVENUE
COACHMAN AS SOON AS THE CROWD HAS DISPERSED ITSELF YOU WILL DRIVE ON THE COACHMAN WHO WAS AN OLD ASSISTANT IN MY ESTABLISHMENT TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT ME AGHAST
I HAD BEEN THERE ON THE SPOT KNOWING THAT I COULD TRUST ONLY MY OWN SENSES AND WAS ABLE TO DECLARE THAT THE SCENT WHICH HAD ESCAPED WAS VERY SLIGHT AND BY NO MEANS DISAGREEABLE
YOU MUST THINK OF SOME OTHER MODE OF LETTING THEM PASS THEIR LAST YEAR
NOT WITHOUT PROVOCATION I THINK
WITH A HUNDRED SOLDIERS NO DOUBT HE COULD GET ME ON BOARD THERE ARE A GREAT MANY MORE THAN A HUNDRED MEN IN BRITANNULA AS GOOD AS THEIR SOLDIERS
I HAD BEEN A MOST GENEROUS FATHER TO HIM AND LOVED HIM AS THE VERY APPLE OF MY EYE
I AT ANY RATE SHALL BE COMFORTABLE WHILE I AM HERE
BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND WOULD HAVE REMAINED SILENT HAD I ALLOWED HIM TO DO SO
IT COMES WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT AND IT GOES WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY GREAT EFFECT
I DINED WITH HIM REGULARLY EVERY DAY EXCEPT TWICE WHEN I WAS INVITED TO THE OFFICERS MESS
I AM NOW NEARLY SIXTY YEARS OLD,--VERY NEARLY FIT FOR THE COLLEGE WHICH ALAS
I'D BE SHOT SAID MR PUDDLEBRANE IF THEY SHOULD DEPOSIT ME AND BLEED ME TO DEATH AND CREMATE ME LIKE A BIG PIG THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT I HAD ENTERED THE SALOON AND THERE CAME A SUDDEN SILENCE ACROSS THE TABLE
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE VERY MANNER OF DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
BUT IT HAS APPEARED
I HAVE BEEN SAVED NOW BY THESE ENGLISHMEN WHO HAVE COME HERE IN THEIR HORROR AND HAVE USED THEIR STRENGTH TO PREVENT THE BARBARITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE
HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND HE DID NOT DO SO
I HAVE THEREFORE WRITTEN THIS PRELIMINARY CHAPTER TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT WAS THE CONDITION OF BRITANNULA IN REGARD TO THE FIXED PERIOD JUST TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE ENGLAND HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF US AND ONCE MORE MADE US HER OWN
AFTERWARDS LITTLEBAT ONE OF THE ENGLISH PROFESSIONALS HAD HIS LEG BROKEN AND WAS NECESSARILY LAID ON ONE SIDE
HOW TRUE IS THE PRESIDENT'S REASONING THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID
CAN GOD HAVE BROUGHT US INTO THE WORLD INTENDING US SO TO LEAVE IT THAT THE VERY ACT OF DOING SO SHALL BE REGARDED BY US AS A CURSE SO TERRIBLE AS TO NEUTRALISE ALL THE BLESSINGS OF OUR EXISTENCE
HE HAD ASKED EVA WHETHER SHE WERE NOT GOING TO ENGLAND AND EVA HAD SAID THAT PERHAPS SHE MIGHT DO SO IF SOME BRITANNULISTS DID NOT DO THEIR DUTY
BUT THOUGH HANDSOME THEY WERE AT PRESENT ANYTHING BUT PLEASANT ABODES
I WAS NEVER MORE THAN NINE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU
FOR THE SAKE OF ONE POOR YEAR HE WAS IMPLORING MY ASSENT TO A BASE FALSEHOOD AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO ADD STRENGTH TO HIS PRAYER BY A BRIBE
GENTLEMEN I SAID YOU ARE POWERFUL
BUT THAT HAS BEEN PREVENTED THANKS TO THE EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY WITH WHICH MY EXCELLENT FRIEND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HAS MADE HIS WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN
THEN THE HALL WAS FILLED WITH A MIGHTY SHOUT AND THERE AROSE A GREAT FURY OF EXCLAMATION
AND AS I TOOK MY PLACE AT THE TABLE I HEARD THAT THE ASSEMBLED CRICKETERS WERE ALL DISCUSSING THE FIXED PERIOD
FOR HALF AN HOUR OR SO I DID FEAR THAT I SHOULD FAIL
HER VERY GENTLENESS IS INTOLERABLE BUT CRASWELLER THE CONVICTIONS OF YOUR MIND CANNOT BE CHANGED I DO NOT KNOW
BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER LENT HIMSELF TO THE OTHER PARTY
I REMEMBER STARTLING THE HOUSE BY FORBIDDING ANY MEMBER TO USE A PHRASE SO REVOLTING TO THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE
NO MY BOY SAID I AFTER A PAUSE I DO NOT KNOW BUT THAT ON THE WHOLE I SHALL PREFER TO GO OF COURSE IF YOU WISH IT I SHALL BE TAKEN THERE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC WHICH IS IN ITSELF A TRIUMPH AND SHALL I PRESUME BE SENT BACK IN THE SAME WAY
HE MERELY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS ON
MRS NEVERBEND SHOULD COME WITH ME OR STAY IF IT SO PLEASED HER IN GLADSTONOPOLIS
MY LORD HE SAID WHAT IS YOUR POPULATION LORD MARYLEBONE NAMED SIXTY MILLION
RUGGLES WAS NOW SOMEWHAT OVER SIXTY AND WAS AN AGENT IN THE TOWN FOR COUNTRY WOOL-GROWERS
I WILL GIVE YOU THE PARTICULARS WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE OFFICE OF COURSE HE WON'T GO MR NEVERBEND CRIED MY WIFE
IN OPPOSITION TO THESE WITNESSES I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
BUT I KNOW THE SIGNS OF IT SO WELL
SIR FERDINANDO'S DID NOT SIT FLAT AND IT LOOKED BULGY
CHAPTER XI
IN SUCH MATTERS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO FOLLOW YOUR WISHES AND SO TO GOVERN YOU THAT YOU MAY STILL FEEL THAT YOU ARE LIVING UNDER THE RULE OF A PRESIDENT OF YOUR OWN SELECTION HERE I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT SIR FERDINANDO WAS A LITTLE RASH
IT WAS BUT YESTERDAY THAT I HAD SEEN HIM SO ABSOLUTELY COWED AS TO BE HARDLY ABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
BUT BRITISH SUBJECTS WE ARE NOT AND NEVER CAN BE AGAIN THIS I SAID BECAUSE I FELT THAT THERE WAS CREEPING UP AS IT WERE IN THE VERY ATMOSPHERE A FEELING THAT ENGLAND SHOULD BE AGAIN ASKED TO ANNEX US SO AS TO SAVE OUR OLD PEOPLE FROM THE WISE DECISION TO WHICH OUR OWN ASSEMBLY HAD COME
I WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT HE NEVER LOOKED AT SIR KENNINGTON BUT THAT HAVING CALCULATED HIS DISTANCE BY MEANS OF A QUICKSILVER LEVELLING-GLASS HIS OBJECT WAS TO THROW THE BALL ON A CERTAIN INCH OF TURF FROM WHICH IT MIGHT SHOOT INTO THE WICKET AT SUCH A DEGREE AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SIR KENNINGTON TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT
BUT MR NEVERBEND IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD GO TO ENGLAND
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I GET TO ENGLAND I SHALL BE REGARDED WITH PERSONAL FEELINGS OF THE SAME KIND YES
SURE ABOUT WHAT THAT THERE IS NOT A FELLOW IN ALL BRITANNULA WILL HAVE SUCH A WIFE AS EVA THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE IN LOVE
EVA MY DEAR SAID I
SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO GUIDE HER AND MIGHT REMAIN THERE TILL THE LAST FATAL MOMENT
THE YOUNG MAN OF THIRTY TRAVELS OVER ALL THE WORLD BUT THE OLD MAN OF SEVENTY IS CONTENTED WITH THE COMPARATIVE CONFINEMENT OF HIS OWN TOWN OR PERHAPS OF HIS OWN HOUSE
BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF CRASWELLER WHOM HE KNEW TO HAVE SANCTIONED AN ENGAGEMENT WITH ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
I WAS GOING TO BE VERY BUSY HE SAID SHOWING AN UNWILLINGNESS
BUT THAT THE AFFAIR WAS TOO SERIOUS TO ADMIT OF PLAYFUL WORDS BETWEEN THE PARTIES
WE'RE ALWAYS READY
AND WOULD IT NOT AFTERWARDS BE TOLD OF ME THAT AS PRESIDENT I HAD BROKEN DOWN IN AN ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT WITH WHICH MY NAME HAD BEEN SO LONG ASSOCIATED
BUT I FELT THAT IN HIS HEART HE ACCUSED ME OF CRUELTY AND OF MAD ADHERENCE TO A THEORY
BUT THERE HE WAS AS INTENT AS EVER WITH HIS MIND FIXED ON THE RECORDS OF THE PRICE OF WOOL AS THEY CAME BACK TO HIM FROM THE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MARKETS
HERE'S THE PRESIDENT SAID SIR KENNINGTON OVAL
THE PRESENT DUKE OF HATFIELD HAS NONE OF THE DASH IF HE HAS MORE THAN THE PRUDENCE OF HIS GRANDFATHER
BUT CUSTOM WOULD NO DOUBT PRODUCE A CURE FOR THAT EVIL
WITH HIS OWN HANDS
I HAD NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TURN ON THE ELECTRIC LAMP OF MY TRICYCLE AND STEAM BACK TO GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT GLADSTONOPOLIS WITH A SAD HEART
THEN ONE OF THE STEWARDS BROUGHT THE MADEIRA WHICH THE YOUNG MAN DRANK WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
NOTHING COULD NOW BE MORE COURTEOUS THAN HIS CONDUCT OR LESS LIKE THE BULLY THAT HE HAD APPEARED TO BE WHEN HE HAD FIRST CLAIMED TO REPRESENT THE BRITISH SOVEREIGN IN BRITANNULA
HIS MIND WAS INTENT ON DEVISING SOME FALSEHOOD BY WHICH HE SHOULD OBTAIN FOR HIMSELF JUST ONE OTHER YEAR OF LIFE AND HIS EXPECTANT SON-IN-LAW PURPOSED TO PREVENT HIM
I HAD PROBABLY ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT SIR LORDS LONGSTOP AND SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WERE TO BE ENTERTAINED AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
BUT IF THE EMPIRE ALLOWED THE WORKING OF THE LAW TO BE COMMENCED IN SILENCE THEN THE FIXED PERIOD MIGHT PERHAPS BE REGARDED AS A THING SETTLED
IN ENGLAND HOW WOULD IT BE WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY
WAS I NOT THINKING OF HIM DAY AND NIGHT AS I ARRANGED MY WORLDLY AFFAIRS
ALTHOUGH AS FAR AS BRITANNULA WAS CONCERNED HE WOULD BE BEYOND THE REACH OF LAW AND REGARDED EVEN AS BEING WITHOUT THE PALE OF LIFE
THE JOHN BRIGHT JACK OF COURSE DID NOT GO TO NEW ZEALAND AND I WAS BOUND TO QUARREL WITH HIM,--TEMPORARILY
I CANNOT BOAST THAT I HAD IN THE LEAST AFFECTED HIS OPINION BY MY ARGUMENTS
IF THERE MIGHT BE POSTPONEMENT SUCH AS THAT I DOUBT WHETHER WE SHOULD EVER FIND THE TIME FOR OUR INHABITANTS TO COME
AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING WARM,--A FRIZZLE OR A CUTLET AND YOU SHOULDN'T EAT IT WITHOUT THINKING OF IT
AND I WAS AGAIN,--AND I COULD NOT BUT SAY TO MYSELF PROBABLY FOR THE LAST TIME,--ONCE AGAIN ON THE ROAD TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
WOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO EXEMPT THEM DOWN TO THE EXTREMEST COUSINS
I THINK NOW THAT SIXTY WAS TOO EARLY AN AGE AND THAT SIXTY-FIVE TO WHICH I GRACEFULLY YIELDED IS THE PROPER FIXED PERIOD FOR THE HUMAN RACE
THEY THINK,--POOR IGNORANT FIGHTING MEN,--THAT SUCH A THEORY CAN BE MADE TO PERISH BECAUSE ONE INDIVIDUAL SHALL HAVE BEEN MASTERED
THAT OTHER ARGUMENT AS TO THE COSTLINESS OF OLD MEN TO THE STATE WAS FOR THE PRESENT DROPPED
MR PRESIDENT WILL YOU TAKE TEA COFFEE COCOA CHOCOLATE OR PRESERVED DATES
THE FRUITS ARE NOT HERE BECAUSE LORD ALFRED GORGED HIMSELF SO TREMENDOUSLY THAT WE WERE AFRAID HIS MOTHER THE DUCHESS WOULD WITHDRAW HIM FROM THE SERVICE WHEN SHE HEARD THAT HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SICK THERE ARE CURACOA CHARTREUSE PEPPERWICK MANGOSTINO AND RUSSIAN BRANDY ON THE SIDE-BOARD SUGGESTED A THIRD
BUT THEN IN ARRANGING THIS MATTER I AM ARRANGING IT FOR MY FELLOW-CITIZENS AND NOT FOR MYSELF
HE SPENT HIS MORNINGS IN MAKING SPEECHES AND THEN WENT DOWN IN THE AFTERNOON ON HIS BICYCLE TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
THINK OF IT ON BOARD THAT VESSEL AND TRY TO BRING HOME TO YOURSELF WHAT SUCH A PHASE OF LIVING WOULD MEAN THEN HE GRASPED ME BY THE HAND AND TAKING ME OUT PUT ME UPON MY TRICYCLE AND RETURNED INTO THE HOUSE
I CAN FANCY THAT AN EASY-GOING BUTTERFLY SHOULD LAUGH AT THE PAINFUL INDUSTRY OF THE ANT
THEN AS THE CARRIAGE PASSED ON INTO THE STREET OF GLADSTONOPOLIS AT THE SPOT WHERE ONE SIDE OF THE STREET FORMS THE QUAY THE VESSEL WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY STEAMED IN AND I COULD SEE ACROSS THE HARBOUR THAT SHE WAS A SHIP OF WAR
I HAVE COME TO YOU BECAUSE I AM VERY UNHAPPY I THOUGHT YOU HAD SHUNNED ME OF LATE SO I HAVE
FEAR HAS NO POWER OVER HIM
ON THE PRECEDING DAY SIR KENNINGTON HAD BEEN DRIVING EVA ABOUT IN HIS CURRICLE AND JACK HAD RETURNED HOME TEARING HIS HAIR
SO I GOT INTO ONE BOAT AND JACK INTO ANOTHER AND OLD CRASWELLER WHO HAD COME WITH HIS GUESTS FROM LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH INTO THE THIRD
IT HAPPENED THAT DURING THIS PERIOD HE WAS ELECTED TO A VACANT SEAT IN THE ASSEMBLY SO THAT WHEN THE MATTER CAME ON FOR DISCUSSION THERE HE WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN PUBLICLY HIS MOTIVES
TILL ANY OF US CAN LEARN MORE THAN WE KNOW AT PRESENT OF THE WILL OF THE ALMIGHTY I WOULD IF HE WILL ALLOW ME ADVISE OUR GOVERNOR TO BE SILENT ON THAT HEAD
AND I COULD NOT BUT BE ANGRY THAT MY NAME SHOULD BE USED IN THIS WAY TO ADORN THE SENTENCES OF SIR FERDINANDO'S SPEECH
AND SIR KENNINGTON HIMSELF HAD I THINK BEEN IN EARNEST BEFORE THE DAYS OF THE CRICKET-MATCH
AND YOU ARE TO CONQUER THEM
AND THEN AGAIN IF I SHOULD FAIL
EVA AND I HAVE DISCUSSED ALL THAT FROM THIS I BECAME AWARE THAT EVA HAD CONVINCED HIM OF THE BASENESS OF THE FALSEHOOD
IS THAT ALL THAT CAN BE SAID FOR THE PHILOSOPHY TO WHICH WE HAVE DEVOTED OURSELVES AND IN WHICH NOTHING FALSE CAN BE FOUND IT WON'T TEACH ANY ONE TO THINK IT BETTER TO LIVE THAN TO DIE WHILE HE IS FIT TO PERFORM ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE
HE WAS SURE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD AN OLD MAN EVER BE DEPRIVED OF HIS LIFE UNDER THE FIXED PERIOD
BUT THEN AGAIN NEITHER IS IT ALTOGETHER OF CRASWELLER THAT I MUST THINK,--NOT OF CRASWELLER OR OF MYSELF
I THE THOUGHTFUL MAN TO YOU THE THOUGHTLESS BOY
AND ALL THIS CHANGE HAD OCCURRED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO DIE OUT IN THE OPEN WORLD INSTEAD OF ENJOYING THE HONOUR OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO DEPART IN CONFORMITY WITH THE NEW THEORY
BUT PRESENTLY SHE WHISPERED TO MY WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT BUT FEEL HORROR FOR THE MAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO MURDER HER FATHER AND BY-AND-BY SHE BEGAN TO OWN THAT SHE THOUGHT JACK A FINE FELLOW
DO THINK OF IT ALL MR PRESIDENT I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING ELSE SO FULL WAS MY MIND OF THE SUBJECT
NO DESPOT COULD ATTEMPT IT LET HIS POWER BE EVER SO CONFIRMED
I HAD NOT DESCENDED FROM THE CARRIAGE
WE BRITANNULANS HAD BECOME NOTED FOR INTELLECT MORALS HEALTH AND PROSPERITY
BUT WE WERE I THINK PECULIARLY INTELLIGENT
THEY TOLD ME THAT HIS PALLAS HELMET WAS SHAKEN WITH TREMENDOUS ENERGY AS HE MADE HIS RUNNING
WHILE BUNNIT AND THE BAR-KEEPER HAD GONE OFF WITH THE HORSES
BUT HOW DIFFERENT NOW WAS HIS FRAME OF MIND FROM THAT GLORIOUS CONDITION TO WHICH I HAD LOOKED FORWARD IN MY SANGUINE HOPES
WHEN WILL YOU HAVE TO BE DEPOSITED IN 1989 I SAID CAREFULLY
AND NO ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TOWARDS COMMUNISM,--AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH OTHERS
BUT I COULD SEE FROM THE TESTIMONY OF HIS ALTERED COUNTENANCE HOW STRONG IS THE PASSION FOR LIFE THAT DWELLS IN THE HUMAN BREAST
SO GODLESS AN IDEA SHALL NEVER FIND A HARBOUR IN THIS BOSOM AND HE STRUCK HIS CHEST VIOLENTLY
AS IT IS I KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT IT IS ALL MY FAULT WHEN IT HANGS OUT AND SHOWS ITSELF THEN I WENT TO SLEEP AND THE PARTING WORDS BETWEEN ME AND MY WIFE HAD BEEN SPOKEN
IN CONSIDERING SUCH MATTERS IT IS SO HARD TO SEPARATE THE MOTIVES,--TO SAY HOW MUCH SPRINGS FROM SOME GLORIOUS LONGING TO ASSIST OTHERS IN THEIR STRUGGLE UPWARDS IN HUMANITY AND HOW MUCH AGAIN FROM MEAN PERSONAL AMBITION
THOUGH IT MAY NEVER BE GIVEN TO ME TO FEEL THE INEFFABLE COMFORTS OF A TRIUMPHANT DEPOSITION,--STILL MY NAME WILL BE HANDED DOWN TO COMING AGES AND I SHALL BE SPOKEN OF AS THE FIRST WHO ENDEAVOURED TO SAVE GREY HAIRS FROM BEING BROUGHT WITH SORROW TO THE GRAVE I AM NOW WRITING ON BOARD H.M
IF JACK INTENDS TO REMAIN AS MY SON HE MUST OBEY HIS FATHER
AND AGAIN THAT MAN STUMPS HAD SEEMED TO BE INVINCIBLE THOUGH STILL LAME AND HAD CARRIED OUT HIS BAT WITH A TREMENDOUS SCORE
AND IF WE HAVE BEEN REABSORBED BY THE MOTHER COUNTRY IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I CANNOT BUT CALL THE PUSILLANIMOUS CONDUCT OF CERTAIN OF OUR ELDER BRITANNULISTS IT HAS NOT BEEN FROM ANY FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE ISLAND BUT FROM THE OPPOSITION WITH WHICH THE FIXED PERIOD HAS BEEN REGARDED
IT WAS A MATTER TO ME OF INFINITE REGRET THAT IT SHOULD BE SO
IT'S JACK THAT CALLS IT BEASTLY
THEY'D HAVE TO LOOK VERY SHARP BEFORE THEY COULD DO THAT
BUT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIM TO HAVE LEFT THE FLOCKS TO HIS SON-IN-LAW AND TO HAVE TURNED HIS MIND TO THE CONSIDERATION OF OTHER MATTERS
IT WAS NOT THAT HE EVER HAD HIS HEART IN IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO ALARM HIMSELF
BUT BEFORE I SPOKE AGAIN I WAS ENABLED TO SEE CLEARLY WHAT DUTY REQUIRED OF ME
I CAN STILL MAKE MY WILL THE SHEEP AND THE OXEN AND THE PASTURES MUST ALSO BE FORGOTTEN
THE CRAFT OF MEN VERSED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE OLD EASTERN WORLD IS NOTORIOUS
AND I MUST CONFESS THAT MY RELATIONS WITH MRS NEVERBEND MADE ME VERY UNFIT TO APE THE ROMAN PATERFAMILIAS
MRS NEVERBEND TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD AT THIS TIME TO SPEAK TO ME ONLY RESPECTING THE MATERIAL WANTS OF LIFE
AFRAID TO MEET AS A FRIEND THAT WHICH YOU MUST MEET SO SOON AS FRIEND OR ENEMY I PAUSED
I DO THINK THAT I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN THIS MATTER TO ADVANCE TOO QUICKLY AND THAT SIR FERDINANDO HAS BEEN SENT HERE AS THE NECESSARY REPRIMAND FOR THAT FOLLY
I HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE TOUCHED SOME FEW NOT BY THE ELOQUENCE OF MY WORDS BUT BY THE ENERGY OF MY THOUGHTS
BUT I THINK THAT MY SYMPATHIES WERE RATHER IN ACCORD WITH THE COWARDICE OF THE OLD MAN THAN WITH THE GREED OF THE YOUNG
WE BECAME HOWEVER MORE FIRMLY ENVELOPED IN THE MASSES AND AT LAST I HAD TO ASK ALOUD THAT THEY WOULD OPEN AND LET US GO ON
WHAT SHOULD BE THE FIXED PERIOD
BUT ALL THE RANK AND FASHION WERE THERE FOR NOTHING UNLESS THEY HAD COME ARMED WITH GLASSES
NEVERTHELESS I HAVE TO FEEL THAT I AM A PRISONER NOT MORE SO THAN ANYBODY ELSE ON BOARD SAID THE LIEUTENANT
IT MUST BE DONE I SAID IN A TONE OF FIRM DECISION
NO DEAR NO
AN OLD SECRETARY OF MINE,--OLD IN YEARS OF WORK THOUGH NOT AS YET IN AGE,--HAD ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT ME BY SAYING THAT THE COLLEGE UP THE HILL MIGHT STILL BE USED BEFORE LONG
I NEED NOT TELL YOU HOW MORE THAN CONTENTED I SHALL BE THAT MY SON SHOULD HAVE SUCH A WIFE
INDEED AS I LEARNT AFTERWARDS HE HAD QUITE A PECULIAR NAME IN THE BRITISH NAVY
BUT ALAS
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO WHOM I COULD LEAVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS INVIDIOUS TASK AS A MATTER OF COURSE
BUT NOW THAT IT WAS BROUGHT HOME TO ME I WAS AWARE THAT ALL MY AUTHORITY WOULD NOT SERVE TO BANISH JACK TILL IT WAS OVER
SAY THE WORD TO ME AND I WILL UNDERTAKE THAT NOT ONE OF THESE MEN SHALL TOUCH YOU I THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSITION
AND THEY HAVE I SUBMIT BEEN MADE NECESSARY BY THE CONDUCT OF YOUR COUNTRY IN THIS MATTER
WHEN THE PLAY BEGAN SIR KENNINGTON WAS AT THE CATAPULT AND JACK AT THE OPPOSITE WICKET AND I COULD HARDLY SAY FOR WHICH SHE FELT THE EXTREME INTEREST WHICH SHE CERTAINLY DID EXHIBIT
I AM RESPONSIBLE,--AS FAR AS STOPPING THIS CARRIAGE GOES
BUT SIR FERDINANDO APOLOGISED FOR THE EARLINESS OF HIS VISIT
MY FRIENDS CONTINUED SIR FERDINANDO AT HOME IN ENGLAND WHERE THOUGH WE ARE POWERFUL BY REASON OF OUR WEALTH AND NUMBERS JUST SO SAID I
IT CONSISTS ALTOGETHER OF THE ABOLITION OF THE MISERIES WEAKNESS AND FAINEANT IMBECILITY OF OLD AGE BY THE PREARRANGED CEASING TO LIVE OF THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BECOME OLD
PERHAPS HE HAS COME ROUND HE IS A GENTLEMAN WHOM WE HAVE BOTH KNOWN INTIMATELY FOR MANY YEARS AND HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FRIEND TO THE FIXED PERIOD
LORD MARYLEBONE WHO SAW THAT I WAS IN EARNEST AND WHO WAS THE MOST COURTEOUS OF GENTLEMEN CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
HE'S AWFULLY IN LOVE WITH HER WHAT WILL HIS FRIENDS SAY AT HOME ASKED MRS NEVERBEND
SO THINKING I RESOLVED THAT I WAS BEFORE MY AGE AND THAT I MUST PAY THE ALLOTTED PENALTY
BUT I SHALL HAVE WASTED MY THOUGHTS AND IN VAIN POURED OUT MY ELOQUENCE AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD IF IN THE COURSE OF YEARS IT DOES NOT AGAIN SPRING TO THE FRONT AND PROVE ITSELF TO BE NECESSARY BEFORE MAN CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT HE IS DESTINED TO ACHIEVE
AND YOUNG GRUNDLE WAS HURT ON THE LOWER PART OF THE BACK AND NEVER SHOWED HIMSELF AGAIN ON THE SCENE OF DANGER
BUT THERE AFTER A FEW YEARS A DAUGHTER WAS BORN TO HIM AND I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED WHEN I PROMISED TO HIM THAT LAST ACT OF FRIENDSHIP THAT IT MIGHT BECOME THE DUTY OF THAT CHILD'S HUSBAND TO DO FOR HIM WITH FILIAL REVERENCE THE LOVING WORK WHICH I HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PERFORM
WHO WOULD MAKE A GREATER STRUGGLE
THAT WAS MY FIRST DESIRE
AND JACK WAS HIMSELF SO HAPPY IN HIS NATURE AND SO LITTLE LIKELY TO LOOK AT ANYTHING ON ITS SORROWFUL SIDE THAT ALL WOULD SURELY GO WELL WITH HIM
I WOULD AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TAKE A LEAF OUT OF MY WIFE'S BOOK AND GO STRAIGHT TO MY PURPOSE
HE IS MY SON AND AS SUCH IT IS ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BE AMENABLE TO IT
AND HE HAS ALWAYS SAID SO
HOW MANY CENTURIES HAS IT TAKEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TO INDUCE IT TO DENOUNCE THE NOT YET ABOLISHED THEORY OF SLAVERY
BUT NO DOG IS REALLY RESPECTED IN THIS WORLD UNLESS HE SHOWS THAT HE CAN BITE AS WELL AS BARK I SHALL NOT BE RESPECTED BECAUSE I CAN NEITHER BARK NOR BITE
CRASWELLER HEARD IT ALL BUT DID NOT MOVE FROM HIS PLACE
NOW AT THE CLOSE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COULD OPPRESSION BE CARRIED TO SUCH A HEIGHT AS THIS
AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERDINANDO
THEY WERE AS GOOD A SET OF FELLOWS AS EVER WORE PINK-FLANNEL CLOTHING AND AS GENEROUS AS ANY THAT THERE ARE BORN TO LIVE UPON PATE AND CHAMPAGNE
BUT NOW AS I WALKED MOURNFULLY AMONG THE DISCONSOLATE AND HALF-FINISHED BUILDINGS I COULD NOT BUT ASK MYSELF AS TO THE PURPOSE TO WHICH MY MONEY HAD BEEN DEVOTED
THE BRITANNULIST ASSEMBLY IN THE MAJESTY OF ITS WISDOM PASSED A LAW TO THAT EFFECT I WAS SORRY AFTERWARDS THAT I HAD SPOKEN OF THE MAJESTY OF THE ASSEMBLY'S WISDOM BECAUSE IT SAVOURED OF BUNCOMBE
I HAD SUCCEEDED,--OR PERHAPS EVA HAD DONE SO,--IN INDUCING HIM TO REPUDIATE THE FALSEHOOD BY WHICH HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT A LAW HAS BEEN PASSED WHICH IF CARRIED INTO ACTION WOULD BECOME ABHORRENT TO MANKIND AT LARGE
I KNOW THAT HIS OWN OPINION WAS THE SAME AS THAT GENERAL IN THE CITY AND I FEARED THAT HIS VERY CAUTION AT THE OUTSET WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO HIM
HE TRUSTED HE SAID THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS DINE WITH HIM DURING THE VOYAGE BUT THAT I SHOULD BE LEFT UNDISTURBED DURING ALL OTHER PERIODS OF THE DAY
JACK'S TOTAL SCORE DURING THAT INNINGS WAS 1275
IN BRITANNULA THEY HAD KNOWN MY TRUE DISPOSITION
I CANNOT SAY THAT THE ENGLISHMEN SEEMED TO HATE US OR WE THEM
THIS HE DID
JACK HAD PERHAPS BETTER LEAVE BRITANNULA FOR A TIME AND NOT COME BACK TILL ALL SHALL BE OVER
NOBODY KNOWS ME
AND YOU I ASKED AGAIN
SARAH SAID I TURNING UPON HER IN MY ANGER THAT IS A VERY IMPROPER WORD AND ONE WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT TEMPT THE BOY TO USE ESPECIALLY IN MY PRESENCE ENGLISH IS ENGLISH MR PRESIDENT SHE SAID
HE HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY NOW AND I PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE MINE BY-AND-BY
OF COURSE SHE HAD WITH HER THE ELDERLY LADIES OF THE COMMUNITY AND AMONG THEM MY OWN WIFE AS THE FOREMOST
BOBBS WAS A YOUNG MAN JUST GETTING INTO PRACTICE IN GLADSTONOPOLIS AND UNDERSTOOD MEASLES I FANCY BETTER THAN THE TRAINING OF ATHLETES
ON WHICH SIDE OF THE FIXED PERIOD SHOULD THE YEAR OF GRACE BE TAKEN
IN THE MEANTIME MY FRIEND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HAS BELOW A GUARD OF FIFTY MARINES WHO WILL PAY YOU THE RESPECT OF ESCORTING YOU ON BOARD WITH TWO OF THE SHIP'S CUTTERS
BUT HE HASN'T MADE ANY WILL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER
YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS TILL YOU HAVE COME TO BE IN LOVE WITH DEPOSITION AND DEPARTURE
THEY WON'T BE ABOVE THIRTY MINUTES LATE AT THE OUTSIDE
HOW LONG WE FOUGHT OVER THIS POINT NEED NOT NOW BE TOLD
IT WAS THE FLAG OF BRITANNULA WITH WHICH GREAT BRITAIN HAD NO CONCERN
BUT I WISH TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND NOW THAT I AM GOING TO ENGLAND AND MAY POSSIBLY NEVER RETURN TO THESE SHORES AGAIN DON'T SAY THAT FATHER WELL YES
POSITIVE RUBBISH
BUT THE LAWYERS WOULD NOT HAVE IT SO AND THEREFORE SO MUCH OF THE PROPERTY OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WAS SAVED FOR THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT OF THAT HAPPY FELLOW JACK NEVERBEND
TWO YEARS SINCE I HAD BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THAT WHICH WE GLORIED TO CALL THE RISING EMPIRE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC
IF THERE EVER WAS A MAN ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIS PROFESSION IT WAS LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES
AND HE SEEMED TO COLLECT HIMSELF IN HIS FIERCENESS AND TO REMAIN OBDURATELY SILENT IN HIS ANGER
BUT ON THIS SHE SEEMED TO ENTERTAIN A VERY WARM OPINION
V
I NO DOUBT DEPENDED VERY MUCH ON ABRAHAM GRUNDLE AND ASSENTED
WHAT WOULD AVAIL THE LOUDEST VOICE OF GREAT BRITAIN AGAINST THE SMALLEST SPARK OF A LAW PASSED BY OUR ASSEMBLY?--UNLESS INDEED GREAT BRITAIN SHOULD CONDESCEND TO AVAIL HERSELF OF HER GREAT POWER AND THUS TO CRUSH THE FREE VOICE OF THOSE WHOM SHE HAD ALREADY RECOGNISED AS INDEPENDENT
THERE SHOULD BE A YEAR DEVOTED TO THAT FINAL YEAR TO BE PASSED WITHIN THE COLLEGE SO THAT BY DEGREES THE MIND MAY BE WEANED FROM THE IGNOBLE ART OF MONEY-MAKING I HAD ONCE SO SPOKEN TO HIM
I SHALL NEVER LIVE TO SEE CARRIED OUT THE GLORY OF THIS MEASURE TO WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED THE BEST YEARS OF MY EXISTENCE
WHAT MAKES A FOREIGNER BUT A DIFFERENT ALLEGIANCE
THERE USED I AM TOLD TO BE ONLY ELEVEN OF THESE MEN
TO ENABLE YOU TO EFFECT THIS CAPTAIN BATTLEAX OF H.M
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND ONLY TO ALLOW EVA AN INCOME OUT OF IT WHILE SHE WAS THINKING OF THAT FELLOW GRUNDLE
I HAVE STILL AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE I DEPART AND I SHALL RUN DOWN TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH TO TAKE YOUR FATHER BY THE HAND ONCE MORE
OF COURSE IT HAS ALL BEEN VERY HAPPY FOR ME JACK CONTINUED
I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS THAT SOCRATES WANTED TO DO FOR HIS UNGRATEFUL FELLOW-MORTALS
I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS A FOOL
THE ASSEMBLY HAS DECLARED THAT THEY IN BRITANNULA WHO ARE LEFT ALIVE AT SIXTY-SEVEN SHALL ON THAT DAY BE BROUGHT INTO THE COLLEGE
AND THOUGH I USED THEM CONSTANTLY I WAS BEGINNING ABSOLUTELY TO HATE THEM
BUT HE WAS CONSIDERABLY DISHEARTENED WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS NOT GOING IN ON THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR SECOND INNINGS
WHEREAS ANOTHER AT SEVENTY IS STILL HALE AND STRONG IN PERFORMING THE DAILY WORK OF HIS LIFE I AM STRONG ENOUGH TO DO A'MOST ANYTHING FOR MYSELF AND I WAS TO BE THE NEXT TO GO,--THE VERY NEXT THIS IN A TREBLE VOICE CAME FROM THAT POOR FELLOW BARNES WHO HAD SUFFERED NEARLY THE PANGS OF DEATH ITSELF FROM THE FIXED PERIOD
I SHALL NOT HAVE A VERY BRIGHT TIME WHEN I ARRIVE IN ENGLAND I SAID TO MY FRIEND CROSSTREES TWO DAYS BEFORE OUR EXPECTED ARRIVAL
I NEVER KNEW A DECENT WOMAN WHO WASN'T AN EPISCOPALIAN
BUT THE PREJUDICES OF THE CITIZENS ARE EVER THE STUMBLING-BLOCKS OF CIVILISATION AT ANY RATE MRS G
MEN LOOKED AND MOVED AND TALKED AS THOUGH THEIR ALL WERE AT STAKE
AND IF HE THE FIRST OF THE FIXED-PERIODISTS WERE TO RUN AWAY THE FASHION OF SO RUNNING WOULD BECOME COMMON
BUT I NOW DOUBTED MYSELF AND FEARED LEST THAT VANITY OF WHICH EVA HAD SPOKEN TO ME HAD OVERCOME ME
IT WILL NOT BE NEEDED
I WOULD AGAIN ENLARGE ON THE MEANNESS OF THE MAN WHO COULD NOT MAKE SO SMALL A SACRIFICE OF HIS LATTER YEARS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RISING GENERATION
AND IN THE MIDST OF THEM SIR FERDINANDO BROWN STOOD UP UPON HIS LEGS AND CONTINUED TO BOW WITHOUT CESSATION
HE WILL HAVE LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO IT AS SOON AS I AM GONE
EVEN TAKING THOSE MEN WHO HAD ARRIVED AT TWENTY-FIVE TO HOW FEW ARE ALLOTTED MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF LIFE
IT WAS FROM THEM NO DOUBT THAT WE CHIEFLY EXPECTED THAT SYMPATHY WHICH HOWEVER WE DID NOT RECEIVE
I TOOK CARE HOWEVER ALWAYS TO PUT ON A WHITE CRAVAT BOTH WITH THE CAPTAIN AND WITH THE OFFICERS
INDEED I DID NOT IN THE LEAST KNOW WHAT THE ENGLISH WERE LIKELY TO DO DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT TO SEND TO THE ENEMIES OF YOUR COUNTRY FOR AID AGAINST YOUR COUNTRY THIS I ASKED WITH MUCH INDIGNATION AND I HAD REFUSED AS YET TO TAKE HIS ARM
THESE WE CONSUMED IN THE FURNACES ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND THE FOUR BODIES HAD BEEN DISSOLVED INTO THEIR ORIGINAL ATOMS WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE BEHIND THEM BY WHICH THEIR FORMER CONDITION OF LIFE MIGHT BE RECOGNISED
THERE'S JACK THERE;--OF COURSE HE IS ONLY A BOY BUT HE SWEARS THAT ALL THE EXECUTIVE AND ALL THE ASSEMBLY AND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS IN BRITANNULA SHAN'T LEAD MY PAPA INTO THAT BEASTLY COLLEGE BEASTLY
HE SIMPLY WAS WILLING TO SHUFFLE OFF HIS MORTAL COIL BECAUSE HE FOUND IT UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WEARING
AS I LOOKED AT THEM KNOWING CRASWELLER AS WELL AS I DID I ALMOST CEASED TO WONDER AT HIS TIMIDITY
IN ANSWER TO SUCH AN APPEAL AS THAT WHO SHALL VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE FIXED PERIOD SHALL BE CARRIED OUT WITH ALL ITS STARTLING AUDACITY
AND THEN I COULD NOT BUT THINK EVEN IN THIS MOMENT OF PUBLIC MISERY HOW WILLING JACK WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE ASSISTED OLD CRASWELLER IN HIS LITTLE FRAUD SO THAT EVA MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE REWARD
SIR FERDINANDO HAD BEEN VERY PARTICULAR IN ASKING THE ATTENDANCE OF CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND AS MANY OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS AS COULD BE SPARED
EVA'S MANNER TO MYSELF HAD BECOME PERFECTLY ALTERED SINCE THE PREVIOUS MORNING
BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT A WHOLE AGE SHOULD BE CARRIED UP TO SOME PROXIMITY TO THE REFORMER BEFORE THERE IS A SPACE SUFFICIENTLY LARGE FOR HIS OPERATIONS
COMFORTED BY THIS RESOLVE I WENT INTO MRS NEVERBEND'S PARLOUR WHERE I FOUND HER SON JACK SITTING WITH HER
SOME YEARS SINCE AFTER THE SEPARATION OF NEW ZEALAND THE INHABITANTS OF BRITANNULA REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND H.M
BUT IT LOOKED STRANGELY LIKE THAT PERSONAL FEELING WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN HIM TWENTY YEARS AGO
I HAD BEEN BUSY AND CAME DOWN A LITTLE LATE AND FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN MAKING MY WAY TO THE CHAIR WHICH SIR FERDINANDO HAD OCCUPIED IN THE MORNING
THINK OF THE POPULATION OF THE TWO COUNTRIES
THEN I GOT UP AND AS I WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM I DECLARED TO MYSELF ALOUD MY PURPOSE
BUT NOW A CREEPING TERROR TOOK POSSESSION OF ME AND I FELT MY HEART GIVE WAY WITHIN ME
BUT SIR FERDINANDO TOOK IT ALL IN GOOD PART AND WENT ON WITH HIS SPEECH
OH CERTAINLY SAID I
BUT I LEARN FROM REALLY GOOD AUTHORITY THAT WHETHER HE TAKES ONE PART OR THE OTHER HE IS ONLY ACTING AND TALLOWAX IS PREPARED TO RUN AMUCK AGAINST THOSE WHO COME TO FETCH HIM
I HAD CALLED THIS MAN MY FRIEND AND BROTHER BUT HOW LITTLE HAD THE MAN KNOWN ME
WE WERE A SMALL PEOPLE AND HAD NOT THEN BEEN BLESSED BY SEPARATION
AND THOUGH HE HAD NEVER AGREED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FIXED PERIOD HAD NOT INTERESTED HIMSELF IN OPPOSITION TO IT
MR BRITTLEREED WAS A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ADVANCED NEARER TO HIS FIXED PERIOD THAN ANY OTHER OF THE CRICKETERS
HE SWEARS THAT NO ONE SHALL LEAD HIM UP TO THE COLLEGE AND YOU THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AND CRASWELLER SAT SILENT WITH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS
I SHOULD NOT CONSIDER MY HEAD TO BE SAFE ON MY OWN SHOULDERS WERE IT TO COME TO PASS THAT WHILE I AM ON THE ISLAND AN OLD MAN WERE EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR SYSTEM ALAS
IT IS FOR YOU AND ME TO BE CARRIED THROUGH THE CITY,--YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE PROUD OF THE PAGEANT AND ME BECAUSE I DO NOT FEAR IT THIS TOO ADDED SOMETHING TO MY SORROW
HE TOOK OFF HIS GREAVES DECLARING THAT THEY IMPEDED HIS RUNNING AND THREW AWAY ALTOGETHER HIS HELMET
THE LIEUTENANT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WE HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD TO HAVE YOU HERE MY LORD I REMARKED
THE WORD SLAUGHTER WAS IN ITSELF PECULIARLY OBJECTIONABLE TO MY EARS,--TO ME WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PERFORM THE FIRST CEREMONY AS AN ACT OF GRACE
BUT THEIR EFFORTS TOO WERE CONSPICUOUSLY SUCCESSFUL
THOUGH I SHOULD LIVE TO BE ACCOUNTED AS CRUEL AS CAESAR WHAT WOULD THAT BE IF I TOO COULD REDUCE MY GAUL TO CIVILISATION
BUT PROMISES ARE LIKE PIE-CRUSTS
ALL THESE THINGS THROVE WITH HIM UNCOMMONLY SO THAT IT MAY BE DECLARED OF HIM THAT HIS LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY OF YOU MR NEVERBEND SHE CONTINUED
IT WOULD BE A PITY SAID TO ME A BRITANNULIST ONE DAY,--A MAN YOUNGER THAN MYSELF,--"TO LOCK UP OLD CRASWELLER AND LET THE BUSINESS GO INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG GRUNDLE
AMONG SAILORS THE BRITISH SAILOR,--THAT IS THE BRITISH FIGHTING SAILOR,--WAS THE ONLY ONE REALLY WORTHY OF HONOUR
BUT HE HAD NO IDEA OF THE LOVE WHICH THE PEOPLE FELT FOR THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE OR,--I BELIEVE I MAY SAY,--FOR THEIR OWN PRESIDENT
BUT A MAN ENGAGED IN PUBLIC LIFE HAS TO FIT HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC DEMANDS
WITH WHOM THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIXED PERIOD FIRST ORIGINATED I WILL NOT NOW INQUIRE
WHILE ONE SHALL BE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE TO A HEAVEN WHICH IS HARDLY MADE MORE ALLURING TO US
FOR AUGHT I KNEW THEY MIGHT PUT ME IN PRISON AND KEEP ME THERE SO AS TO BE SURE THAT I SHOULD NOT RETURN TO MY OWN PEOPLE
THE LAW DEMANDS YOU CAN'T DO IT AND THERE'S AN END OF IT SAID MRS NEVERBEND
IF HE SHOULD PROVE FALSE WHEN THE MOMENT CAME WHO WOULD PROVE TRUE
AND FOR WHAT GOOD
BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO WALK AWAY TO ONE'S LONG REST WHILE HEALTH AND WORK AND MEANS OF HAPPINESS YET REMAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO IMPLY THAT HE HAD ABANDONED THE WEAK ASSERTION AS TO HIS AGE AND NO LONGER INTENDED TO ASK FOR A YEAR OF GRACE BY THE USE OF THAT FALSEHOOD
BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEAS A NATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE SMALL EXTERNAL ACCIDENTS OF ITS COIN OR ITS LANGUAGE BUT ON THE FLAG WHICH IT FLIES
I SAW YOU SITTING THERE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS VERY THOUGHTFUL SAID HE AND I WOULDN'T DISTURB YOU
THIS WAS LEISURELY CONSUMED
WHAT RIGHT HAD I THEN AS THE FIRST OF THE FIXED-PERIODISTS TO HOPE THAT I MIGHT LIVE TO SEE MY SCHEME CARRIED OUT OR THAT I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO DEPART AS AMONG THE FIRST GLORIOUS RECIPIENTS OF ITS ADVANTAGES
YOUR MODE OF LIFE HERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL AND WE HAVE BEEN THINKING SO MUCH OF OUR CRICKET THAT I HAVE HARDLY AS YET HAD A MOMENT TO LOOK AT YOUR INSTITUTIONS
AND THOUGH IN ALL RESPECTS OF DOMESTIC LIFE MRS NEVERBEND IS THE BEST OF WOMEN EVEN AMONG WOMEN SHE IS THE MOST ILLOGICAL
AND IN OLD DAYS THERE HAD BEEN A SPICE OF MANLINESS IN HIS BOSOM TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD BRING HIM BACK
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME FOR A WHILE TO BE IN ENGLAND THAN IN BRITANNULA
AND YET HOW MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ACCURACY OF FOLLOWING THE LAW
HE ANSWERED ME ONLY BY DRAWING AWAY HIS HAND
DOES NOT THE PSALMIST SAY THE SAME?--"IF BY REASON OF STRENGTH THEY BE FOURSCORE YEARS YET IS THEIR STRENGTH LABOUR AND SORROW AND THE SECOND IN REQUIRING THOSE WHO REMAIN TO LIVE A USELESS AND PAINFUL LIFE
HIS MOTHER OFFERED TO TAKE A WALK WITH HIM IN THE CITY PARK
PEOPLE WON'T LET YOU DO IT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA I SAID WILL NEVER INTERFERE TO PREVENT THEIR MAGISTRATE FROM ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW BOTHER SAID MRS NEVERBEND
UP FLEW ON ALL SIDES OF THE GROUND FIGURES TO SHOW THAT STUMPS HAD MADE A DOZEN AND TWO BRITISH CLARIONETS WERE BLOWN WITH A GREAT DEAL OF VIGOUR
I HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE PLACE WHERE AS GOVERNING OFFICER I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN OF USE,--AND NOW COULD BE OF USE NO LONGER
AND WORSE THAN THAT SIR KENNINGTON OVAL HAD SCORED UP TO 300
THE PARLIAMENT IN ENGLAND MIGHT ORDER A THREE-MONTHS-OLD BABY TO BE SLAIN BUT COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET THE DEED DONE NOT IF IT WERE FOR THE WELFARE OF GREAT BRITAIN NOT TO SAVE GREAT BRITAIN FROM DESTRUCTION
IT IS NECESSARY THAT A NEW RACE SHOULD COME UP BEFORE THE PREJUDICES ARE ERADICATED
I HAD BEEN SURPRISED AT CRASWELLER'S EARNESTNESS AND ALSO AT HIS ELOQUENCE AND I WAS IN TRUTH MORE FULL OF HIS WORDS THAN OF HIS REASONS
EVA CRASWELLER WILL HINDER IT SAID RUGGLES
BUT NO
IT WAS IN VAIN FOR ME TO PRESS THE COACHMAN
NOTHING WAS BETTER KNOWN IN THE EMPIRE THAN THE AGES OF THE TWO OR THREE FIRST INHABITANTS TO BE DEPOSITED
YOU'VE GOT TO ENDURE THAT SAID HE
NO DOUBT HE KNEW THE EXACT AGE OF THE MAN AS WELL AS I DID BUT IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO HAVE HASTENED HIS DEPOSITION
ALL THE ENGLISHMEN WERE MADE TO RETIRE TO FURTHER DISTANCES FROM THE WICKETS AND TO STAND ABOUT ALMOST AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GROUND
I HAD THOUGHT THAT I HAD DONE IT ALL IN ORDER THAT THE FAILING STRENGTH OF OLD AGE MIGHT BE RELIEVED AND THAT THE RACE MIGHT FROM AGE TO AGE BE IMPROVED
WHEN I SAY EDUCATED I MEAN PREJUDICED
MY SON WOULD MARRY NO MAN'S DAUGHTER FOR HIS MONEY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT OF JACK SHE SAID FOR I KNOW THAT HE IS GENEROUS AND GOOD
HERE IN GLADSTONOPOLIS I WAS WELL KNOWN,--AND WELL KNOWN TO BE NEITHER IMPERTURBABLE NOR SELF-ASSURED
HERE THEY COME
AFTER TWENTY MINUTES SPENT IN WHAT SEEMED TO ME THE VERY OSTENTATION OF SUCCESS ANOTHER MAN WAS GOT TO THE WICKETS
THERE WOULD STILL BE A YEAR FOR HIM
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN PERHAPS EIGHT-AND-TWENTY YEARS OLD WHOSE GREAT GIFT IN THE EYES OF ALL THOSE ON BOARD WAS HIS PERSONAL COURAGE
BUT I PUT UP WITH THAT AND DETERMINED TO ANSWER HER AFTER HER OWN HEART
IN PREPARING WISDOM FOR BABES IT IS NECESSARY TO WRAP UP ITS PRECEPTS IN CANDIED SWEETS
I HAVE PUT YOU UP FOUR PAIRS OF FLANNEL DRAWERS AND A LITTLE BAG WHICH YOU MUST WEAR UPON YOUR CHEST
YOU ARE DESIRED TO PROCEED AT ONCE TO BRITANNULA TO REANNEX THE ISLAND AND TO ASSUME THE DUTIES OF THE GOVERNOR OF A CROWN COLONY
NO DOUBT,--KNOWING NOTHING OF THE FORMS OF OUR GOVERNMENT OR THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTERED OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE
AND AT LAST AS AN EXTREME FAVOUR TWO ENTIRE DAYS WERE ALLOWED FOR MY DEPARTURE
BUT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HIM TO SHAKE IT ON THE PART OF THE HUMAN RACE GENERALLY AND NOT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
WELL GRAYBODY I SAID I SUPPOSE WE ARE NEARLY READY FOR THE FIRST COMER OH YES
BUT JACK SAID THAT THE PROFESSIONAL WAS THE BEST MAN THEY HAD
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
AND THEREFORE I MUST BE CHEERFUL
I HAD NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THE DAY ON BOARD THE YACHT AND HE NOW SEEMED TO BE GREYER AND MORE HAGGARD THAN HE WAS THEN
THIS WAS EVIDENTLY CRASWELLER'S PURPOSE
AFTER SOME SCORE OF YEARS SAY WHEN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE USED TO THE FIXED PERIOD I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT A DAUGHTER OR A WIFE MIGHT LEAVE THE COLLEGE AND GO AWAY INTO SUCH SOLITUDES AS THE OCCASION REQUIRED A WEEK PERHAPS BEFORE THE HOUR ARRANGED FOR DEPARTURE HAD COME
BUT THE WORLD ISN'T RIPE FOR IT AND WE SHALL ONLY BE LAUGHED AT THERE WAS TRUTH IN THIS AND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONCESSION HAD ALSO BEEN MADE
BUT I BETHOUGHT ME HOW MANY EARLY REFORMERS HAD PERISHED IN THEIR EFFORTS AND HOW SELDOM IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRST MAN TO SCALE THE WALLS OF PREJUDICE AND FORCE HIMSELF INTO THE CITADEL OF REASON
WITH ALL HER TENDERNESS AND ALL HER SWEET LOVE EVA FEELS THAT MY DAYS ARE NUMBERED UNLESS I WILL BOLDLY DECLARE MYSELF OPPOSED TO YOUR THEORY
ME THE PRESIDENT OF A FOREIGN NATION THE FIRST OFFICER OF A PEOPLE WITH WHOM GREAT BRITAIN WAS AT PEACE,--THE CAPTAIN OF ONE OF HER GUNBOATS MUST CARRY ME OFF HURRY ME AWAY A PRISONER WHITHER I KNEW NOT AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY UNGOVERNED WITH NO PRESIDENT AS YET ELECTED TO SUPPLY MY PLACE
WE REPUDIATED NO DEBT,--AS HAVE DONE SOME OF OUR NEIGHBOURS
I WAS BOUND MYSELF TO SEE THE GAME BECAUSE A SPECIAL TENT AND A SPECIAL GLASS HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE PRESIDENT
SHE THREATENS US WITH A LIE IN HER MOUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SIR
HE WAS TALL ROBUST AND BROAD AND THERE WAS NO BEGINNING EVEN OF A STOOP ABOUT HIM
IT'S A PITY PRESIDENT YOUR SON HAD NOT BEEN BORN A FEW YEARS SOONER AT THIS MOMENT MY BOY WAS HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN YOUNG GRUNDLE AND A MUCH BETTER SPECIMEN OF A BRITANNULIST
I HOPE HE WILL STICK TO THE BUSINESS HE NEED NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT THAT
THEY'RE PRETTY NEARLY ALL ALIVE SAID GRAYBODY
I HAVE BUSINESS FOR YOU TO TRANSACT WITH MACMURDO AND BROWN OF SOME IMPORTANCE
SHE'D BETTER FACE IT OUT AT HOME THAN GO ACROSS THE WORLD TO HEAR WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY OF US
HE SAW THE BEAUTY OF THE THEORY AS WELL AS DID I MYSELF AND WOULD SPEAK OFTEN OF THE WEAKNESS OF THAT PRETENDED TENDERNESS WHICH WOULD FEAR TO COMMENCE A NEW OPERATION IN REGARD TO THE FEELINGS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE OLD WORLD
NOW JACK THOUGH VERY YOUNG WAS CAPTAIN OF THE CLUB AND DEVOTED MUCH MORE OF HIS TIME TO THAT OCCUPATION THAN TO HIS MORE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS AS A MERCHANT
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU WHAT I'VE NOW GOT TO SAY
CAN ANY MAN LOVE ANOTHER BETTER THAN I DO YOU I WOULD SAY TO HIM WITH ENERGY
WHY SHOULD PAPA BE THE FIRST
IT HAD LEAKED OUT THAT THOUGH HE WAS NO DOUBT ATTACHED TO EVA CRASWELLER HE HAD THOUGHT QUITE AS MUCH OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
YOUNG GRUNDLE HAD NOW LEFT ME AND AS I SAT THINKING OF IT I WAS FOR A MOMENT TEMPTED TO ABANDON THE FIXED PERIOD ALTOGETHER
SHOULD HE ATTEMPT TO FLY COULD WE PREVENT HIS FLYING
WON'T THEY SAID JACK
I HAD ASSUMED AN ANGRY AIR AS THOUGH I WERE OFFENDED WITH HIM FOR TROUBLING ME ON A MATTER BY REFERRING SIMPLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL
OUGHT I NOT SO TO HAVE ARRANGED MATTERS THAT I MYSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST,--TO HAVE POSTPONED THE USE OF THE COLLEGE TILL SUCH TIME AS I MIGHT MYSELF HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED
AND IF YOU HAVE A GRAIN OF SENSE LEFT IN YOUR HEAD YOU WON'T ATTEMPT IT
BUT A STRONGER REASON THAN THIS PERHAPS ACTUATED ME
BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO OUR DIGNITY AS MEN THAT WE SHALL FIND THE MODE OF DOING SO
TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT TIME AND I BEING A WORN-OUT OLD MAN AND FITTED ONLY FOR THE GLORY OF THE COLLEGE HAVE NOTHING LEFT ME BUT TO WRITE THIS STORY SO THAT COMING AGES MAY SEE HOW NOBLE WERE OUR EFFORTS
HE MANAGES EVERYTHING AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND MANAGES IT VERY WELL BUT MY DEAR I WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN TO HER THAT IN A QUESTION OF SUCH ENORMOUS PUBLIC INTEREST AS THIS OF THE FIXED PERIOD IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF INDIVIDUAL CASES
THEY WOULD BE PREPARED FOR THEIR DEPARTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR COUNTRY SURROUNDED BY ALL THE COMFORTS TO WHICH AT THEIR TIME OF LIFE THEY WOULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE IN A COLLEGE MAINTAINED AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE
AND TO THEM THERE WOULD BE NO DEGRADED FEELING THAT THEY WERE THE RECIPIENTS OF CHARITY
I HAVE BEEN QUITE SURE OF IT
AND I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO REGARD HER AS MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND TO LOVE HER DEARLY IN THAT POSITION ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MOMENTS IN WHICH JACK'S IMPUDENCE AND NEW SPIRIT OF OPPOSITION ALMOST TEMPTED ME TO DISINHERIT HIM
SIR FERDINANDO BROWN WAS ALLOWED TO LAND AND BY THE REJOICING MADE AT THE FIRST GOVERNMENT HOUSE BALL AS I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED SINCE I LEFT THE ISLAND IT APPEARED THAT THE BRITANNULISTS REJOICED RATHER THAN OTHERWISE AT THEIR THRALDOM
IT MIGHT BE THE CRUSHING DIFFICULTY WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO THE SYSTEM AS FAR AS MY EXISTENCE WAS CONCERNED
YOUR SON SIR HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THE MULTITUDE ABOUT THE FIXED PERIOD AND THEY SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN QUITE BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR HIM IT WAS THUS THAT THE MATTER WAS TOLD ME BY ONE OF THE CLERKS IN MY OFFICE AND I OWN THAT I DID RECEIVE SOME SLIGHT PLEASURE AT FINDING THAT JACK COULD DO SOMETHING BEYOND CRICKET
THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH I HAVE EVER BEEN ASKING MYSELF,--WHICH YOU AND I HAVE ASKED OURSELVES AND WHICH I THOUGHT WE HAD ANSWERED
AND I MUST SAY THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE EXCELLENT FELLOWS HIS OFFICERS HAS DONE HIS BEST TO PLACE H.M
HAD EVA CRASWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD-LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MR BUNNIT AND THE BAR-KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL,--SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
THEY ALL SAY THE AUTUMN IS THE BEST
WHAT LANGUAGE IN WHICH TO SPEAK OF THE GREAT SYSTEM
AND THE UNKNOWN FUTURE OF ANOTHER WORLD TO BE APPROACHED BY SO GREAT A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES,--BY THE LOSS OF OUR VERY FLESH AND BLOOD AND BODY ITSELF,--HAS IN IT SOMETHING SO FEARFUL TO THE IMAGINATION THAT THE MAN WHO THINKS OF IT CANNOT BUT BE STRUCK WITH HORROR AS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BY HIMSELF TOO IT HAS TO BE ENCOUNTERED
THEN THERE AROSE A DEBATE UPON THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF THE MEASURE WHICH WAS CARRIED ON WITH GREAT WARMTH
WE ARE ROBBED OF OUR CONSTITUTION OUR FREEDOM OF ACTION IS TAKEN FROM US AND WE ARE REDUCED TO THE LAMENTABLE CONDITION OF A BRITISH CROWN COLONY
YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU 100 MEN OF THE NORTH-NORTH-WEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MR NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
GOVERNMENT IS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSTITUTION UNDER WHICH THE FIXED PERIOD CAN BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL
WE ARE NEVER SHORT OF MONEY IN BRITANNULA
HAD IT BEEN I I MYSELF HOW PROUD SHOULD I HAVE BEEN OF MY COUNTRY AND ITS WISDOM HAD I BEEN LED ALONG AS A FIRST HERO TO ANTICIPATE THE EUTHANASIA PREPARED FOR ME
BUT THE THEME WAS DISAGREEABLE AND I THOUGHT THAT THE TRIAL HAD BEEN SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO MAKE IT UNNECESSARY THAT THE EXPENSE SHOULD BE AGAIN INCURRED
STILL I CANNOT BUT FEAR THAT A TAINT OF THAT SELFISHNESS WHICH I HAVE HITHERTO AVOIDED BUT WHICH WILL COME IF I ALLOW MYSELF TO BECOME OLD MAY REMAIN AND THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME THAT I SHOULD GO HENCE WHILE AS YET MY OWN POOR WANTS ARE NOT ALTOGETHER UPPERMOST IN MY MIND
WE WERE THE VERY CREAM AS IT WERE THAT HAD BEEN SKIMMED FROM THE MILK-PAIL OF THE PEOPLE OF A WIDER COLONY THEMSELVES GIFTED WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE
IF HE WAS TO GET ACROSS TO AUCKLAND OR TO SYDNEY AND TO LEAVE SOME ONE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY FOR HIM WHAT COULD YOU DO
WE WERE ARRANGING THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTENDED BY PLEASANT VISITORS TILL WITHIN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO AND I WAS MAKING SPECIAL ALLUSION TO THE LAW WHICH REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD ABANDON ALL CONTROL OF HIS PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ENTERING THE COLLEGE
SINCE OUR HORSES HAVE GONE BEFORE US AND CRASWELLER AND THE CROWD HAVE GONE WE WILL FOLLOW THEM THEN I PUT MY ARM WITHIN HIS AND AS I WALKED DOWN THE HILL I ALMOST TOOK JOY IN THINKING THAT CRASWELLER HAD BEEN SPARED
JACK IS A HANDSOME BOY I GRANT BUT THAT IS ABOUT ALL THAT CAN BE SAID OF HIM
BUT THERE AROSE CERTAIN QUIBBLES AND QUESTIONS ALL OF WHICH JACK HAD AT HIS FINGERS'-ENDS BY THE STRENGTH OF WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN WAS TROUNCED
WHERE WE ARE POWERFUL I REPEAT BY REASON OF OUR WEALTH AND NUMBERS THOUGH PERHAPS LESS ADVANCED THAN YOU ARE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARRANGEMENTS OF LIFE IT HAS SEEMED TO US TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE THEORY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE CARRIED TO ITS LEGITIMATE END
BUT WITH THE MUTUAL FRIENDLY WISHES OF BOTH
SIR LORDS LONGSTOP TOO HAD RUN UP A GOOD SCORE BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT OUT BY THE MIDDLE LONG-OFF,--A MARVELLOUS CATCH THEY ALL SAID IT WAS,--AND OUR TRUMPETS WERE BLOWN FOR FULLY FIVE MINUTES
THEREFORE WE CAN BE COURTEOUS WHILE WE SUBMIT
IF SO IT MIGHT BE WELL THAT I SHOULD GO TO THE UNITED STATES AND THERE BEGIN TO TEACH MY DOCTRINE
AND THERE I STOOD FOR HALF AN HOUR GRIMACING AND PAYING COMPLIMENTS ANXIOUS FOR THE MOMENT WHEN SIR FERDINANDO WOULD GET INTO THE SIX-OARED GIG WHICH WAS WAITING FOR HIM AND RETURN TO THE SHORE
HAD THEY BEEN LESS SORELY PRESSED THAN WAS I NOW AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT
AND JACK WITH OVER 200 STILL TO MAKE DECLARED THAT HE GAVE UP THE BATTLE ALMOST AS LOST
I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT SHE WILL BE RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS BY ALL THE OVALS
IT SEEMED TO ME AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM AND TOOK THE CHAIR THAT WAS OFFERED TO HIM THAT HE WAS THE GREATER MAN OF THE TWO ON THE OCCASION,--OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY OF THE THREE
A PRESENTIMENT INDEED
AND INDEED FOR MYSELF I DID NOT CARE HOW SOON I MIGHT BE ANNIHILATED
ANY DANGER,--ANY IMMEDIATE CERTAINTY,--WOULD HAVE BEEN CHILD'S-PLAY
HE HAD GRADUALLY BECOME MY CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND AND TO HIM I MADE KNOWN ALL THE SORROWS WHICH FELL UPON ME DURING THE VOYAGE FROM THE IGNORANCE OF THE MEN AROUND ME
BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG OF WHAT MRS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA
I KNEW TOO THAT AT HOME I SHOULD NOT DARE TO TELL MY WIFE THAT THE OFFER HAD BEEN MADE TO ME AND HAD BEEN REFUSED
HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO TEMPT ME WITH HIS FLOCKS AND HERDS
VI
THAT FERDINANDO BROWN KNOWS HOW TO CONCEAL HIS CLAWS BENEATH A VELVET GLOVE
AND I FEAR NO EVIL RESULTS FROM HER ANGER FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE HER CONDUCT TO ME WILL I KNOW BY EXPERIENCE BE AS CAREFUL AND AS KIND AS EVER
NOR COULD IT BE EFFECTED BY ANY CONGRESS OF WHICH THE LARGE MAJORITY WERE NOT AT ANY RATE UNDER FORTY YEARS OF AGE
JACK SAID I IT IS THE SIGN OF A NOBLE MIND TO BEAR CONTUMELY WITHOUT PETULANCE
BUT I'M SURE SHE'LL NOT FIRE IT OFF IN OUR HARBOUR
BUT SHE INTERRUPTED ME AT ONCE
THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
THEY CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER
HOW WAS I TO ANSWER FOR THE ZEAL OF THOSE WHO WERE TO COME SO LONG AFTER ME
WILL YOU NOT TAKE YOUR GREATCOAT SAID I SEEING THAT HE WAS GOING OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR WITHOUT PROTECTION
WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT THE FIXED PERIOD JACK WHO WAS PRESENT PUT ON A SERIOUS FACE AND ASSUMED THAT AIR OF DETERMINATION WHICH I WAS BEGINNING TO FEAR
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GO DOWN WITH HIM AND SEE HIM ON BOARD JACK ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD,--BY WHICH I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE MEANT REBELLION
AND THEN IF THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST CRASWELLER WOULD RESIGN A FOURTH OF HIS PROPERTY ALMOST WITHOUT A PANG AND JACK WOULD CONTENT HIMSELF IN MAKING THE MEANNESS OF GRUNDLE CONSPICUOUS TO HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS
OF A POPULACE THAT ARE NOT LAW-ABIDING NOTHING BUT EVIL CAN BE PREDICTED
NOBODY HAD BEEN INTO THE COLLEGE AS YET
AND YET THAT SOMETHING MUST BE PLAYFUL IN ITS NATURE
I SUPPOSED YOU HAD ALL HEARD OF IT OF COURSE WE HAD ALL HEARD OF IT
I AM HERE ONLY TO PAY MY RESPECTS AS A MESSENGER FROM GREAT BRITAIN TO BRITANNULA TO CONGRATULATE YOU ALL ON YOUR LATE VICTORY AT CRICKET AND TO SAY HOW LOUD ARE THE PRAISES BESTOWED ON MR JOHN NEVERBEND JUNIOR FOR HIS SKILL AND GALLANTRY
BUT NOBODY CONCEIVED THAT TO BE POSSIBLE
I UNDERSTAND IT
AND I'M AFRAID THAT IF YOUR GRANDFATHER WERE LIVING AMONG US HE WOULD HAVE TO BE DEPOSITED LIKE THE REST NOT IF SIR FERDINANDO WERE THERE SAID THE BOY
AND IT SEEMED TO ME AS THOUGH HE ENJOYED THE EXERCISE OF THE TYRANNY WHICH CHANCE HAD PUT INTO HIS POWER
AS FAR AS ONE CAN JUDGE OF HIS OWN CAPACITIES I WAS NEVER BETTER ABLE TO MANAGE MY BUSINESS THAN I AM AT PRESENT
A HERO WAS WANTED
AND HE COULD ALWAYS SELL HIS SALMON FOR HALF-A-CROWN A POUND AND HIS PHEASANTS FOR SEVEN-AND-SIXPENCE A BRACE
YEARS WERE NAMED ABSURD IN THEIR INTENDED LENIENCY;--EIGHTY AND EVEN EIGHTY-FIVE
OR RATHER IN DISCUSSING THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD LET US FORGET THE LOVES OF A BOY AND A GIRL BUT THE SHEEP AND THE OXEN AND THE PASTURES
BUT IT WAS ONLY AT SUCH MOMENTS THAT I WAS ALLOWED TO EXPERIENCE THIS FEELING OF TRIUMPH
IT MAY BE THAT A PORTION OF THE MASSES SHOULD HAVE BEEN IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS BEING DONE WITHIN THE EMPIRE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC
HE HAS NOT THE ELOQUENCE OF HIS GREAT-GRANDFATHER BUT HE IS THEY TELL US A SAFE MAN
HE DOES NOT WORK AND HE CANNOT ENJOY LIVING
AND THEY REGARDED ME WITH ALL THAT HORROR WHICH THE MODERN NATIONS HAVE ENTERTAINED FOR CANNIBALISM
IT SEEMED TO ME AS FAR AS I COULD GO INTO THE MATTER THAT GRUNDLE HAD ALL THE LAW ON HIS SIDE
I OBSERVED THAT SIR FERDINANDO WHEN HE WAS PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS SPEECH SHOWED THAT HE HAD JUST SUCH A LITTLE BAG ON
BECAUSE THE ALMIGHTY SO WILLED IT OUR GOVERNOR WILL SAY TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT HE WILLED EVERYTHING OF WHICH A RECORD IS GIVEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
IN MY EARLIER YEARS I HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE WOOL TRADE AND HAD AMASSED WHAT MEN CALLED A LARGE FORTUNE
I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT JACK WHO WAS SO BOLD IN PLAYING HIS MATCH AND WHO HAD BEEN SO WELL ABLE TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST THE ENGLISHMEN,--WHO HAD BEEN MADE A HERO AND HAD CARRIED OFF HIS HEROISM SO WELL,--SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO SHAMEFACED AND BASHFUL IN REGARD TO EVA
I SAT FOR SOME TIME MOTIONLESS TRYING TO TURN OVER IN MY MIND ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID TO ME
MADE STRONGER ALSO
AM NOT I A BRITANNULIST AS WELL AS YOU AND AS SHE WALKED AWAY I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A TEAR IN HER EYE
THEY SAY THAT MEN AND WOMEN WOULD NOT HAVE QUITE THE SAME SMELL SAID HE
IT WAS ALL ENGLAND AGAINST BRITANNULA
BUT NOW WHEN THE IDEA WAS REPRESENTED TO MY MIND'S EYE I ACKNOWLEDGED TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD BE LEFT THERE FOR THE OCCASION
OF ALL TERMS IN THE LANGUAGE THERE WAS NONE SO OFFENSIVE TO ME AS THAT ODIOUS WORD WHEN USED IN REFERENCE TO THE CEREMONY WHICH I HAD INTENDED TO BE SO GRACIOUS AND ALLURING
THE LAW WAS ON MY SIDE AND SO MUST STILL BE ALL THOSE WHO IN THE ASSEMBLY HAD VOTED FOR THE FIXED PERIOD
TWO YEARS BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE BUT TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE DEPOSITION TWO YEARS BEFORE DEPOSITION SAID CRASWELLER
THERE ARE THEY ALL TO BE SEEN IN PUDDLEBRANE CHURCH AND I SHOULD LIKE TO APPEAR AMONG THEM I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY THEIR NAMES THAT APPEAR AND NOT THEIR BODIES MR PUDDLEBRANE
HE WOULD NOT GO OUT ON HIS BICYCLE AS FEARING THAT SOME ACCIDENT MIGHT OCCUR
HOW COULD I HELP IT WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS TO DEPOSIT POOR PAPA IN THAT HORRID PLACE HE WAS EQUALLY ANXIOUS A FEW YEARS SINCE NEVER
I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE THE VERY PLACE FOR HIM
IF HE ATTENDS THIS MEETING HE MUST LEAVE MY HOUSE AND I SHALL SEE HIM NO MORE LEAVE THE HOUSE SHRIEKED MRS NEVERBEND
I HAVE GOT A LETTER FROM MY OLD AUNT IN HAMPSHIRE WRITTEN TO MY MOTHER WHEN I WAS BORN WHICH PROVES THE MISTAKE I REMEMBER THE LETTER WELL I SAID,--FOR WE HAD ALL GONE THROUGH SUCH DOCUMENTS IN PERFORMING THE IMPORTANT TASK OF SETTLING THE PERIOD
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I ENDURED EVEN FOR THE LAST YEAR
TO TELL A NEW TRUTH ABOUT THE HEAVENS AND EITHER TO PERISH OR BECOME GREAT FOR EVER!--EITHER WAS WITHIN THE COMPASS OF A MAN WHO HAD ONLY HIS OWN LIFE TO RISK
TO ME IT WAS OF ALL HALF-HOURS THE WEARIEST BUT TO HIM IT SEEMED AS THOUGH TO GRIMACE AND TO PAY COMPLIMENTS WERE HIS SECOND NATURE
AND IN THIS MATTER HE HAS BEEN DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO HIS FATHER FROM FIRST TO LAST
I BREAKFASTED ALONE IN MY OWN CABIN WHERE EVERYTHING WAS PROVIDED FOR ME THAT I COULD DESIRE AND ALWAYS LUNCHED AND TOOK FIVE-O'CLOCK TEA WITH THE OFFICERS
IT WAS SAID BY THE DEFENDENTS OF GRUNDLE WHO WERE TO BE FOUND FOR THE MOST PART AMONG THE YOUNG MEN AND YOUNG WOMEN THAT ABRAHAM WAS SIMPLY ANXIOUS TO CARRY OUT THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY
I BECAME AWARE AFTERWARDS THAT HE SLEPT THAT NIGHT AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
AND I DID FEEL AT THE MOMENT THAT I HAD SOMEWHAT GOT THE BETTER OF SIR FERDINANDO
COULD I NOT TALK HIM INTO A GENEROUS ASSENT
SHE ALTOGETHER HATED THAT WRETCH GRUNDLE FOR WANTING TO GET RID OF HIM
THEN CAME HIS TURN AGAIN AND HE CAUGHT THE FIRST BALL WITH HIS NEVERBEND SPRING-BAT,--FOR HE HAD INVENTED IT HIMSELF,--SUCH A SWIPE AS HE CALLED IT THAT NOBODY HAS EVER YET BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE BALL
ONLY THAT IT ISN'T TOO LATE YOU KNOW
NEITHER WOULD JACK NOR MRS NEVERBEND SAY ANYTHING AND THEY ATE THEIR DINNER GLOOMILY TILL THE ATTENDANT LEFT THE ROOM
YOU ALL REMEMBER WHAT THE POET SAYS OR THAT THE EVERLASTING HAD NOT FIXED HIS CANON GAINST SELF-SLAUGHTER IS NOT THIS SELF-SLAUGHTER THIS THEORY IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH A MAN SHALL DEVOTE HIMSELF TO DEATH AT A CERTAIN PERIOD
IT ALWAYS WAS NINE YEARS EARLIER IT WAS ALL MANIFESTLY UNTRUE
AT ANY RATE I CANNOT STIR FROM HERE TILL AFTER THE MATCH IS OVER
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH I WERE TREATED WITH ALMOST ROYAL HONOUR
I WILL NOT DEMEAN MYSELF TO CLAIM A POOR YEAR OF LIFE BY SUCH MEANS THOUGH I DO NOT LACK EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE STATEMENT
I HAVE BEEN SENT HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ON A PECULIAR MISSION,--ON A DUTY AS TO WHICH THOUGH I AM DESIROUS OF EXPLAINING IT TO ALL OF YOU IN EVERY DETAIL I FEEL A DIFFICULTY OF SAYING A SINGLE WORD FIXED PERIOD WAS SHOUTED FROM ONE OF THE BALCONIES IN A VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS THAT OF MR TALLOWAX
I DID SEE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INDUCE IN THE PRESENT GENERATION A FEELING OF SATISFACTION IN THE SYSTEM
THE COLUMBUS OF THIS AGE
YOU YOURSELF HAVE I THINK TEN YEARS TO RUN AND YOU WILL NOT BE MUCH LONGER LEFT TO PASS THEM IN SOLITUDE IT IS WEARY BEING HERE ALL ALONE I MUST CONFESS
IT DID COME DOWN AND WAS CAUGHT BY STUMPS BUT BY THAT TIME BRITANNULA HAD WON HER VICTORY
WHEN SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAD TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ASKED DOWN TO WINDSOR I HAD TAKEN HIS FLOWERY PROMISES AS BEING WORTH NOTHING
LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES WOULD TELL MY SERVANT TO WAIT UPON ME AND WOULD SHOW ME ALL THE COMFORTS,--AND DISCOMFORTS,--OF THE VESSEL WITH THAT I LEFT HIM AND WAS TAKEN BELOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE LIEUTENANT
HE WAS AS CAREFUL AS EVER ABOUT HIS FLOCKS AND AT SHEARING-TIME WOULD STAND ALL DAY IN THE WOOL-SHED TO SEE TO THE PACKING OF HIS WOOL AND THE MARKING OF HIS BALES
WHAT COULD I DO BY PUBLISHING ANYTHING IN BRITANNULA
THEN YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR POWDER AND SHOT
THEY WERE TO BE A MONTH IN BRITANNULA BEFORE THEY WOULD BEGIN THE MATCH SO NECESSARY WAS IT THAT EACH MAN SHOULD BE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE PHYSICAL CONDITION
THOUGH MR NEVERBEND HAS NAMED A FIXED PERIOD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND HAS PERHAPS CHOSEN THAT AT WHICH ITS ENERGIES MAY USUALLY BE FOUND TO DIMINISH WHO CAN SAY THAT HE HAS EVEN APPROACHED THE CERTAINTY OF THAT DEATH WHICH THE LORD SENDS UPON US ALL AT HIS OWN PERIOD
WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS HIS HEALTH DRUNK IT IS I CONCEIVE HIS DUTY TO DO SO
GRAYBODY AND I HAD COME AS YOUNG MEN TO BRITANNULA TOGETHER AND WHEREAS I HAD SUCCEEDED IN ALL MY OWN INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY FAILED
AND THEN I SPOKE MY THOUGHTS FREELY TO HIM
IT MIGHT BE ONLY TO ME BUT I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE THINKING OF JACK
PAPA IS A BRAVE MAN MY DARLING CHILD IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR YOU SAY SO OF HIM HE IS GOING WITH YOU TO-MORROW SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS MADE YOU A PROMISE AND DOES NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE IT SAID OF HIM THAT HE BROKE HIS WORD EVEN TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE
AND HE WAS QUITE AS HOSTILE TO JACK AS TO CRASWELLER
THOUGH TO ME THE POLITICO-ECONOMICAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WAS ALWAYS VERY STRONG THE RELIEF TO BE BROUGHT TO THE AGED WAS THE ONE ARGUMENT TO WHICH NO REPLY COULD BE GIVEN
EVA HAS COME TO BID YOU GOOD-BYE SAID JACK WHO WAS ALREADY IN THE ROOM AS I ENTERED IT
FOR THE PRESENT I SHALL RULE HERE
SO STRONG WAS THE FEELING IN THE EMPIRE THAT ONLY TWO MEMBERS WERE ABSENT AND THE NUMBER REMAINED THE SAME DURING THE WHOLE WEEK OF THE DEBATE
THE STATE CANNOT ALLOW ITSELF TO INDULGE IN ROMANCE YOU GET A SAILOR AND TELL HIM TO STRIKE A WOMAN AND SEE WHAT HE'LL SAY THE SAILOR IS IRRATIONAL
HE SHAN'T STIR A STEP SAID BUNNIT TO THE BAR-KEEPER
AND THEY HADN'T THEN INVENTED THE NEW PATENT STEEL CLIMBING ARMS
EVA WAS PERFECT IN SYMMETRY IN FEATURES IN COMPLEXION AND IN SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS
COULD I HAVE SAVED ALL GLADSTONOPOLIS FROM IMMINENT FLAMES BY YIELDING AN INCH IN MY CONVICTIONS I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO IN MY THEN FRAME OF MIND
NOW IN SPITE OF WHAT THE CAPTAIN SAID I UNDOUBTEDLY HAD INTENDED TO MAKE A SPEECH
THIS WINE HAS BEEN SEVEN TIMES ROUND THE WORLD HE SAID AND THE ONLY TIME FOR DRINKING IT IS FIVE-O'CLOCK TEA,--THAT IS IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOOD LIVING MEANS I ASKED SIMPLY FOR A CUP OF TEA WHICH I FOUND TO BE PECULIARLY GOOD PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CREAM WHICH ACCOMPANIED IT
IT WAS HIS FAVOURITE BAT SAID HIS MOTHER AND BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
YOU HAVE ALWAYS PROVIDED A SANDWICH FOR ME TO TAKE TO THE CHAMBERS SANDWICHES ARE NOTHING
THEY HAVE TRAVELLED EVEN AS FAR AS MY EARS
HAD MR CRASWELLER BEEN ABOUT TO BE DRAGGED TO A FELON'S PRISON YOU COULD NOT HAVE USED MORE OPPROBRIOUS LANGUAGE
AT THAT TIME MY DEAREST FRIEND AND MOST TRUSTED COADJUTOR WAS GABRIEL CRASWELLER
DO YOU A BRITANNULIST AND MY WIFE INTEND TO TURN THE SPECIAL GLORY OF BRITANNULA TO THE DISGRACE OF HER PEOPLE
LET US TURN THE INEVITABLE INTO THAT WHICH SHALL IN ITSELF BE ESTEEMED A GLORY TO US
IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT SHOULD BE THE FIXED PERIOD
IF I WERE IN THE ASSEMBLY I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE BOUND TO SUPPORT MY FATHER BUT YOU'RE NOT IN THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE MY OWN CONVICTIONS ALL THE SAME AND I FIND MYSELF CALLED UPON TO TAKE A PART GOOD GRACIOUS--YES
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL TO POSTPONE IT FOR ANOTHER CENTURY
A SLIGHT TIP COUNTED EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN A GOOD FORWARD BLOW BECAUSE THE BALL WENT BEHIND THE WICKET
IS IT NOT SO WITH US ALL
IT WAS AT LAST DECIDED THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE COLLEGE AT SIXTY-SEVEN AND THAT BEFORE THEIR SIXTY-EIGHTH BIRTHDAY THEY SHOULD HAVE DEPARTED
BUT I NEVER COULD BRING MYSELF TO BE ANGRY WITH EVA
AND IF ALL THE PAPAS HAD BEEN DEPOSITED FOR THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I SHOULD CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT
I MUST I FELT CHOOSE SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPOUNDING THAT SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT
FOR THAT I CANNOT ANSWER
BUT THIS OCCASION WAS TO BE AN EXCEPTION TO ALL RULE
I NEVER SAW A MAN SO BOWLED OVER IN MY LIFE
THERE ARE TWENTY ACRES OF PLEASURE-GROUND FOR YOU TO WANDER OVER THEN HE TURNED UPON ME A LOOK,--OH SUCH A LOOK!--AND WENT ON AND TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE
THAT WAS A MISTAKE
IN STRUGGLING FOR THE WELFARE OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES A MAN MUST DARE TO ENDURE TO BE OBLITERATED,--MUST BE CONTENT TO GO DOWN UNHEARD OF,--OR WORSE STILL RIDICULED AND PERHAPS ABUSED BY ALL,--IN ORDER THAT SOMETHING AFTERWARDS MAY REMAIN OF THOSE CHANGES WHICH HE HAS BEEN ENABLED TO SEE BUT NOT TO CARRY OUT
IT DID NOT IN THE LEAST AWAKEN MY ATTENTION
I FEARED THAT THE FIXED PERIOD COULD ONLY BE GOOD FOR A REPUBLIC IN WHICH THERE WERE NO CLASSES VIOLENTLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR INFERIOR BRETHREN
HOW WOULD IT BE WITH ME IF THIS WERE SOME GREAT ENGLISH VESSEL COMING INTO OUR HARBOUR ON THE VERY DAY OF CRASWELLER'S DEPOSITION
I SAY THAT THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT IS A TYRANT AND THAT YOU ARE THE INSTRUMENTS OF ITS TYRANNY
IF YOU WILL THINK OF THE LINE OF REASONING USED BY SIR FERDINANDO YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT HE HAS AFTER ALL ONLY THROWN YOU BACK UPON THE OLD PREJUDICES OF MANKIND
I HAVE COME OUT FROM GLADSTONOPOLIS BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE YOU
MR GRUNDLE IS SAYING IT ALREADY AND IS ACCUSING ME TOO
IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT JACK MUST STILL MAKE ANOTHER 500 BEFORE THE GAME WOULD BE WON
MR BRITTLEREED REMAINED BUT HE WAS ALL
IT IS ALTOGETHER IN YOUR BOSOM
ONE BRITISH GUNBOAT THEY DECLARED IN THE HARBOUR OF GLADSTONOPOLIS WOULD REDUCE US--TO ORDER
SURELY THE COLONY WAS DETERMINED TO GROW IN TRUTH OLD BEFORE IT COULD GO INTO THE COLLEGE
BUT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH MY FACULTIES WERE UTTERLY OBLITERATED IN DESPAIR
I USED TO HEAR THAT THE SIX MILES HAD BEEN DONE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
THAT MAN SHOULD SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT OF IT DOES NOT APPEAR AMISS TO ME
THE FOLLOWING DAY OCCURRED A MOST DISAGREEABLE SCENE IN MY OWN HOUSE AT DINNER
MANY AND MOST INTERESTING WERE THE CONVERSATIONS HELD BETWEEN CRASWELLER AND MYSELF ON THE GREAT SUBJECT WHICH FILLED OUR HEARTS
AND ALL THIS WOULD BE MADE A LAUGHING-STOCK TO BRITANNULA IF THIS OLD MAN CRASWELLER DECLINED TO ENTER THE GATES
I AND A FEW OTHERS DID SUCCEED AT LAST IN STOPPING THE USE OF THAT WORD
IF I ASKED FOR MY LIBERTY I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF MY BLOODTHIRSTINESS IT WOULD BE FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE THAT I SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF IT
SHOULD IT NOT BE SO CRASWELLER AS YOU PLEASE PRESIDENT BUT SHOULD IT NOT BE SO THEN AT GREAT LENGTH I WENT OVER ONCE AGAIN ALL MY FAVOURITE ARGUMENTS AND ENDEAVOURED WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF MY ELOQUENCE TO REACH HIS MIND
THE FAME OF HIS CHARACTER IN THAT RESPECT HAD REACHED MY EARS EVEN AMONG THE THICK-LIPPED INHABITANTS OF CENTRAL AFRICA I OWN I DID WONDER WHETHER THIS COULD BE TRUE
BUT I BLUSHED FOR ITS UNTRUTH
COME THIS WAY MR PRESIDENT HE SAID
CRASWELLER YOU ARE SIXTY-SIX NOW AND WILL BE SIXTY-SEVEN THIS TIME NEXT YEAR
AND IT WAS BETTER THAN NATURAL IT WAS BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU SHOULD WISH TO SAVE HIM BY THE USE OF THE ONLY FEMININE WEAPON AT YOUR COMMAND OH BUT I DID LOVE JACK SHE SAID
NOW ALL THIS WAS ALTERED
HE PUT THE INSTRUMENT ALTERNATELY TO HIS MOUTH AND TO HIS EAR AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT CAPTAIN BATTLEAX WAS DESIROUS THAT WE SHOULD ALL GO HOME TO OUR OWN HOUSES
AND HAVING OBTAINED FROM EUROPE AND THE STATES ALL THE BEST MACHINERY FOR THE PURPOSE I HAD SUPPLIED FOUR IMMENSE HOGS IN ORDER THAT THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE FAIRLY TESTED AND I HAD FATTENED THEM FOR THE PURPOSE AS OLD MEN ARE NOT UNUSUALLY VERY STOUT
A PRETTIER SPOT AS IT TURNED OUT FOR THE FATTENING OF BOTH BEEF AND MUTTON AND FOR THE GROWTH OF WOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FOUND
BUT AS WAS SAID THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUNBOAT WOULD NEVER DARE TO TOUCH THE WIRE THAT SHOULD COMMIT SO WIDE A DESTRUCTION
TILL YESTERDAY I DID DOUBT WHETHER SHE WOULD USE HER STRENGTH TO PERPETUATE HER OWN PREJUDICES AND TO PUT DOWN THE PROGRESS MADE BY ANOTHER PEOPLE
I FOUND AN EASY SEAT ON THE STERN OF THE VESSEL AND SAT MYSELF DOWN TO CONSIDER ALL THAT CRASWELLER HAD SAID TO ME
WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT
CREMATION IS NO PART OF THE FIXED PERIOD
JACK IS DETERMINED TO MEET THE MEN ON THE TOWN FLAGS THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW AND I SAY THAT HE IS RIGHT
THERE ARE THINGS SO TERRIBLE THAT IF YOU WILL ONLY CREATE A BELIEF IN THEM THAT WILL SUFFICE WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE
WHY SHOULD NOT ALL OTHER LAWS BE THE SAME ALSO BUT IT WOULD BE MURDER WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF MURDER KILLING PEOPLE THEN YOU ARE MURDERERS WHO GO ABOUT WITH THIS GREAT GUN OF YOURS FOR THE SAKE OF KILLING MANY PEOPLE WE'VE NEVER KILLED ANYBODY WITH IT YET YOU ARE NOT THE LESS MURDERERS IF YOU HAVE THE INTENT TO MURDER
AND AFTER THAT IT NEED NOT BE DOUBTED BUT THAT THE AMERICANS WERE FOREIGN TO THE ENGLISH;--AND IF THE AMERICANS WHY NOT THE BRITANNULISTS
THE COLLEGE WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT UNDER MY AUSPICES AS A PREPARATION FOR THE HAPPY DEPARTURE IS TO BE MADE A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TWO AS IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME
SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WOULD NO DOUBT BE CARRIED OUT WHEN THE WORKING OF THE FIXED PERIOD HAD BECOME A THING ESTABLISHED
BUT I AM FOR THE TIME AS THOUGH I WERE WITHIN THE CLAPPER OF A MILL
OUR ASSEMBLY'S WISDOM WAS NOT PARTICULARLY MAJESTIC
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT THE STOKERS ON BOARD THE SHIP WERE ONLY PRETENDING TO GET UP THEIR FIRES AND THE SAILORS PRETENDING TO WEIGH THEIR ANCHORS IN ORDER THAT THEIR OPERATIONS MIGHT BE VISIBLE AND THAT I MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT I HAD RECEIVED A GREAT FAVOUR FROM MY ENEMIES HANDS
THE PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC NEVER RUNS AWAY IN HIS OWN PERSON
WHEN A MAN KNEW THAT IT WAS TO BE SO THE DOZEN VISITORS WOULD SUFFICE FOR HIM
I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU UNHAPPY THAT YOU ARE CARRIED AWAY TO ENGLAND HAD IT DONE SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE GONE--ALIVE THEY SAID THAT WHEN IT WAS SUGGESTED YOU PROMISED TO BE READY IN TWO DAYS I DID SAY SO--BECAUSE IT SUITED ME
BUT IF THERE CREEP UPON HIM A DOUBT AS TO HIS DUTY IF HE ONCE BEGIN TO FEEL THAT HE MAY PERHAPS BE WRONG THEN FAREWELL ALL PEACE OF MIND,--THEN WILL COME THAT CONDITION IN WHICH A MAN IS TEMPTED TO ASK HIMSELF WHETHER HE BE IN TRUTH OF SANE MIND
I AM AWARE THAT IT IS QUITE USELESS TO SPEAK A WORD AND THAT I CAN ONLY ALLOW THE CLOCK TO RUN ITSELF DOWN
HOW SHALL I CREATE AN INTEREST FOR IT
DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF HE SAID REPEATING THE WORDS TWICE OVER
PERSUASION CAN NEVER TOUCH HIM
YOU DO NOT THINK THAT I AM CRUEL I ASKED
IS IT FAIR TO KEEP HIM TO SUCH A PROMISE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE LAW I WILL HEAR NOTHING OF THE LAW
WHY SHOULD I
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT HE CAN REALLY PLAY CRICKET JACK HAD SAID THAT MORNING SPEAKING WITH GREAT AUTHORITY
AND WHEN THE TIME FOR VOTING CAME HE CERTAINLY DID VOTE FOR SEVENTY-FIVE
NO HE EXCLAIMED
IF THERE BE A TRACE OF THE FEELING OF ANTAGONISM IN THE WORD FOREIGNERS I WILL NOT USE IT
BUT HE WILL I TRUST YET COME BACK TO THE RIGHT WAY OF THINKING
X
HE WAS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT RATHER ON MY SIDE OF THE QUESTION AND HAVING HAD HIS FREEDOM SECURED TO HIM DID NOT CARE FOR SIR FERDINANDO
AND I PERHAPS SHOULD BE CONTENTED AND GRATIFIED DURING THE YEARS WHICH I AM DOOMED TO LINGER THROUGH IMPOTENT IMBECILITY TO THINK THAT I HAVE BEEN THE FIRST REFORMER OF MY TIME THOUGH I SHALL BE DOOMED TO PERISH WITHOUT HAVING ENJOYED ITS FRUITS
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER MURDER
I HAVE NO DOUBT THE WORLD WILL BE A GREAT DEAL THE BETTER FOR IT
ON BOARD SHIP HE LIVED NEARLY ALONE HAVING HIS FIRST LIEUTENANT WITH HIM FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EVERY MORNING
THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION AND I FELT MYSELF BOUND TO SAY SOMETHING AS TO THE VIOLENT INTERRUPTION TO WHICH I HAD THIS MORNING BEEN SUBJECTED
AND FOUNDATIONS HAD BEEN MADE FOR OTHERS STILL SMALLER,--FOR A WHOLE TOWNSHIP OF OLD MEN AND WOMEN AS IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS THEY MIGHT COME HURRYING ON TO FIND THEIR LAST ABODE IN THE COLLEGE
I DID NOT QUITE EXPLAIN MY IDEA AT THE MOMENT IT IS FORGOTTEN HE SAID
I AM TO ASK IF HE WILL DO CAPTAIN BATTLEAX THE HONOUR TO COME ON BOARD AND TAKE TIFFIN WITH HIM
OF COURSE HE'S NOT MUCH OF A MAN AS YET BUT HE IS YOUR OWN SON
I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT IN SPITE OF THE ISOLATED MANNERS OF GREAT BRITAIN READERS IN THAT COUNTRY GENERALLY MUST HAVE BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE VIEWS OF THE FIXED-PERIODISTS
AND THE POVERTY IS ABOUT I FEAR TO SHOW ITS HEAD SIR FERDINANDO HERE AROSE AND EXPOSTULATED
THE LAW MEANS YOU AND YOUR INFLUENCES
I SOMETIMES THINK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO DWELL UPON THIS HORRID FIXED PERIOD BY THE MELANCHOLY OF AN EMPTY STOMACH IT WAS SAD TO HEAR SUCH WORDS FROM HER LIPS AFTER THE TWO SPEECHES TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED AND TO FEEL THAT NO TRACE HAD BEEN LEFT ON HER MIND OF THE TRIUMPH WHICH I HAD ACHIEVED OVER SIR FERDINANDO
I OUGHT INDEED TO HAVE SUPPLIED FOUR OTHER HOGS AND TO HAVE TRIED THE EXPERIMENT AGAIN
HAD THERE BEEN ANY ONE IN OUR PARLIAMENT CAPABLE OF SHOWING THAT THEY COULD REASONABLY DESIRE IT THE BILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PASSED
I HAVE PUT IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A STORY BECAUSE I THINK THAT I MAY SO BEST DEPICT THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME AS I MADE MY GREAT ENDEAVOUR TO CARRY OUT THE FIXED PERIOD IN BRITANNULA AND BECAUSE I MAY SO DESCRIBE THE KIND OF OPPOSITION WHICH WAS SHOWN BY THE EXPRESSION OF THOSE SENTIMENTS ON WHICH LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES DEPENDED
BUT YOU ARE TO PUT YOURSELF IN OPPOSITION TO THE GREATEST MOVEMENT MADE ON BEHALF OF THE HUMAN RACE FOR CENTURIES
WHAT AN EXPRESSION TO USE,--AND THIS FROM THE MOUTH OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN A DETERMINED FIXED-PERIODIST
I SHALL PROCEED AT ONCE TO CARRY OUT THE FIXED PERIOD I FELT THAT MY HONOUR DEMANDED THAT TO SUCH A QUESTION I SHOULD MAKE NO OTHER REPLY
I THINK I MAY SAY THAT NO RACE SO WELL INFORMED EVER BEFORE SET ITSELF DOWN TO FORM A NEW NATION
AND AS HIS ORDER IS BACKED BY A DOUBLE FILE OF RED-COATS,--AN INSTRUMENT WHICH IN BRITANNULA WE DO NOT POSSESS,--I PURPOSE TO OBEY HIM
CRASWELLER'S ELOQUENCE HAD HAD THAT EFFECT UPON ME
JACK CAME UP TO ME BUT WHERE EVA WENT I COULD NOT SEE
IF ONLY WE COULD ARRIVE AT THE TIME IN WHICH PRACTICE SHOULD HAVE BECOME PRACTICE
HOW CAN YOU PROVE IT
THIS HAD NOT GIVEN RISE TO THE BEST FEELING AND I FEARED LEST THERE MIGHT BE AN ABSOLUTE QUARREL BEFORE THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED
WE SHALL BE WANTED UP IN THE BALTIC AT ONCE
I COULD BUT SHOW THE COOLNESS OF MY COURAGE BY DESIRING THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON
NOR WILL HIS RULE BE IN ANY RESPECT DISOBEYED UNTIL THE ISLAND SHALL WITH THE AGREEMENT OF ENGLAND AGAIN HAVE RESUMED ITS OWN REPUBLICAN POSITION HERE I BOWED AND HE BOWED AND WE ALL BOWED
UNDER MY CANOPY THERE WAS ROOM FOR FIVE OF WHICH I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE MIDDLE THRONES
SIR FERDINANDO HAD ON THIS OCCASION DRESSED HIMSELF WITH MINUTE CARE
HE WOULD DEPOSIT PAPA THIS VERY MOMENT IF HE HAD THE POWER
WAS THERE ANY HONOUR OR WORSE AGAIN COULD THERE BE ANY UTILITY IN BEING THE PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC IN WHICH SUCH THINGS COULD HAPPEN
BUT IF WE WERE ABOLISHED CONTINUED HE THEN I MIGHT GET INTO THE OTHER PLACE AND DO SOMETHING
I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO DO THERE AND OF COURSE IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NOT COME BACK AND I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT I DO NOT PART FROM YOU IN THE LEAST IN ANGER
BUT THEY WILL NOT OWN THAT THEY ARE INFIRM
BUT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD BE SURE OF THIS
WE DO FIND IT A LITTLE DULL HERE NOW HE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID THE DAY AND THE YEAR OF CRASWELLER'S BIRTH
FATHER SAID HE IMMEDIATELY YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEPOSIT OLD CRASWELLER
EVERYBODY DECLARED THAT SUCH A THING HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE ACHIEVED AT CRICKET,--AND THE BALL PASSED ON AND EIGHT OR TEN RUNS WERE SCORED
I DON'T WANT EVER TO HEAR HIS NAME AGAIN
FOR THE TRACK DOWN TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WAS CROWDED WITH THEM AND THEY WERE STILL PRACTISING AS THOUGH ANOTHER MATCH WERE CONTEMPLATED
AND I AM SURE THAT I SHALL BE TREATED WELL ON BOARD
IT IS THEREFORE DESIRED THAT YOU SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS TO HIS INTENTIONS
YOU WERE BORN IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND THE OLD LADY IN ENGLAND DID NOT WRITE TILL THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHO SAYS SO
JACK I SAID TO MY SON I GOT A POST-CARD FROM NEW ZEALAND YESTERDAY THE BOATS HAD JUST BEGUN TO RUN BETWEEN THE TWO ISLANDS SIX DAYS A-WEEK AND AS THEIR REGULAR CONTRACT PACE WAS TWENTY-FIVE MILES AN HOUR IT WAS JUST AN EASY DAY'S JOURNEY
AS WE WERE DRIVEN AWAY,--CRASWELLER AND I,--I HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY TO HIM
I WAS SO CRUSHED BY GRIEF SO OBLITERATED BY THE AGONY OF THE HOUR THAT I HARDLY SAW WHAT PASSED BEFORE MY EYES
SO IT SHALL BE WITH ME SAID I
BUT HE WAS SURE TO SUCCEED IN TELLING US THAT HE WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE BY MEANS OF THE DOUBLE FILE OF ARMED MEN BY WHOM HE IS ACCOMPANIED AND THE 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER WITH WHICH AS HE INFORMED ME HE IS ABLE TO BLOW US ALL INTO ATOMS UNLESS I WOULD BE READY TO START WITH CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TO-MORROW
BUT BY DEGREES THE CROWD BECAME SO NUMEROUS THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS STOPPED IN ITS PROGRESS
HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CASE AND GENERALISE WIDELY ABOUT SOME FUTURE TIME
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT A YEAR OF PROBATION IS TO BE ALLOWED TO THOSE VICTIMS WHO HAVE AGREED TO THEIR OWN IMMOLATION
THEN JACK NEVERBEND SHALL HAVE LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE AND EVA ALSO AS HIS OWN FOR EVER AND EVER,--OR AT ANY RATE TILL HE TOO SHALL BE LED AWAY TO EXECUTION A VICTIM
THERE HAD BEEN SOME WHISPERINGS IN THE EMPIRE AMONG THE ELDERLY MEN AND WOMEN OF A DESIRE TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF GREAT BRITAIN IN SETTING IT ASIDE
BESIDES THEY DO COUNT SOMETHING ON MY SPRING-BATTING
THAT THEORY BY WHICH A HUMAN BEING SHALL JUMP AT ONCE TO A PERFECTION OF BLISS OR FALL TO AN ETERNITY OF EVIL AND MISERY HAS NEVER FOUND CREDENCE WITH ME
STILL IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT A MAN SHOULD BE HAPPY
AT THE END OF THE FIRST DAY JACK HAD SCORED ABOVE 500;--BUT ELEVEN WICKETS HAD GONE DOWN AND ONLY THREE OF THE MOST INFERIOR PLAYERS WERE LEFT TO STAND UP WITH HIM
DURING THE TWENTY MINUTES WHICH WERE TAKEN IN GOING DOWN THERE I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF THE WALKS I HAD HAD UP AND DOWN WITH CRASWELLER IN OLD TIMES TALKING AS WE WENT OF THE GLORIES OF A FIXED PERIOD AND OF THE ABSOLUTE NEED WHICH THE HUMAN RACE HAD FOR SUCH A STEP IN CIVILISATION
BUT SAID EVA TO ME THAT EVENING THEY'LL NEVER GET THE TWENTY EACH AND ON WHICH SIDE ARE YOU EVA I INQUIRED WITH A SMILE
WILL YOU HAVE ANOTHER LUMP OF SUGAR IN YOUR TEA MR PRESIDENT OR IF YOU WANT A SECOND BLANKET ON YOUR BED MR NEVERBEND AND WILL SAY THE WORD IT SHALL BE SUPPLIED I TOOK HER IN THE SAME MOOD AND WAS DIGNIFIED CAUTIOUS AND SILENT
I HAD MY DOUBTS AS I LOOKED AT THE CONTEST WHETHER ANY OF THEM WOULD BE LEFT TO PLAY OUT THE MATCH
IT WAS MELANCHOLY TO SEE THE ENGLISH MINERVA AS HE AGAIN SHOULDERED HIS SPEAR AND WALKED BACK TO HIS TENT
AND IF BY NONE WHO SPEAK ENGLISH WHO SHALL THEN ASPIRE TO EXCEL YOU
BUT I HAD NOT COME OUT TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THE LOVE MATTERS OF THE TWO CHILDREN
THEREFORE IT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY THAT A QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED IN WHICH CRASWELLER'S NAME WAS NOT MENTIONED BUT WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO SOME GENERAL DEBATE
WHY WAS I THUS DRIVEN TO ACT A PART THAT WAS FALSE
FOR THE OTHER EVA HAD ASKED AND OF COURSE IT HAD BEEN AWARDED TO HER
OH A MOST FATAL FRIENDSHIP
THE CRICKET-MATCH
THE CRICKET-MATCH
BUT THE DREAD OF IT IS TO THE GENERALITY MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FACT OF ITS POSSESSION YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
SO GREAT IS THE POPULARITY OF THEIR PRESIDENT MR NEVERBEND THAT IF HE BE LEFT ON THE ISLAND YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL FIND A DANGEROUS RIVAL
I THE PRESIDENT OF A FREE REPUBLIC THE ELECTED OF ALL ITS PEOPLE THE CHOSEN DEPOSITORY OF ITS OFFICIAL LIFE,--I WAS TO BE KIDNAPPED AND CARRIED OFF IN A SHIP OF WAR BECAUSE FORSOOTH I WAS DEEMED TOO POPULAR TO RULE THE COUNTRY
JACK'S FACE WAS SO NEARLY HEALED THAT MRS NEVERBEND HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO BELIEVE ENTIRELY IN THE EFFICACY OF VIOLENT EXERCISE FOR CUTS AND BRUISES
MY TIME HERE IN BRITANNULA IS BUT SHORT AND I CANNOT GIVE UP MORE OF IT EVEN TO MY CHOSEN DAUGHTER THEN AGAIN SHE KISSED ME AND PUTTING ON HER LITTLE HAT WENT AWAY TO MRS NEVERBEND,--OR TO JACK
AND I AS BEING THE ONLY LORD MEAN TO ELECT MYSELF PRESIDENT
NOR I WAS INFORMED DID EVA
BUT LORD MARYLEBONE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BEEN MRS NEVERBEND'S WISHES FOR HER OWN SON
SHE WAS A FINE GIRL AT ALL POINTS AND HAD BEEN QUITE ALIVE TO THE DAWN OF THE FIXED PERIOD SYSTEM
IF HE CEASES TO BEHAVE TO ME LIKE A SON I SHALL CEASE TO TREAT HIM LIKE A FATHER
AND WHY WAS PHARAOH AND HIS HOSTS DROWNED IN THE RED SEA
IT HAS ALL THE FINISHED POLISH OF ENGLAND JOINED TO THE FERVID IMAGINATION OF IRELAND
EVA WHO HAD NOT HITHERTO PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO CRICKET BECAME ON A SUDDEN PASSIONATELY DEVOTED TO IT
HE WAS USUALLY MELANCHOLY DISHEARTENED AND IMPOVERISHED
THE SIGHT OF THESE CHIMNEYS THAT WAS A MISTAKE CRASWELLER
BUT AS FOR MRS NEVERBEND NOTHING WOULD BRING HER TO SET FOOT WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE COLLEGE GROUND
NOW WAS THE TIME FOR THOUGHT
HE'S RIGHT YOU KNOW
BUT BOBBS DECLARED THAT VIOLENT EXERCISE WOULD BE NECESSARY TO KEEP THE EYE IN ITS RIGHT PLACE AND JACK WAS AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH MANIPULATING HIS STEAM-BOWLER IN THE AFTERNOON
IGNORANCE HAS BEEN EXPELLED FROM YOUR SHORES AND POVERTY HAS BEEN FORCED TO HIDE HER DIMINISHED HEAD HERE THE ORATOR PAUSED TO RECEIVE THAT APPLAUSE WHICH HE CONCEIVED TO BE RICHLY HIS DUE
BUT I WAS NEVERTHELESS ABLE TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THE BILLS IN COMMITTEE AND I DID SO WITH SOME ENTHUSIASM
I WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE
YES SAID LORD MARYLEBONE
A GUARD OF SOLDIERS CAME UP THIS MORNING TO LOOK AFTER ME
IF I COULD ONLY PREVAIL ON YOU MR PRESIDENT ON THIS I SHOOK MY HEAD IN EAGER DENIAL
THE NATURAL WEAKNESS INCIDENTAL TO MY FEELINGS WOULD HAVE PREVAILED
I POINTED OUT THAT THE FEW OLD MEN NOW ON THE ISLAND MIGHT BE EXEMPTED AND THAT EVEN THOSE ABOVE FIFTY-FIVE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO DRAG OUT THEIR EXISTENCES IF THEY WERE WEAK ENOUGH TO SELECT FOR THEMSELVES SO DEGRADING A POSITION
THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH ON WHICH THE SYSTEM IS FOUNDED WAS TOO STRONG TOO MIGHTY TOO DIVINE TO BE ADOPTED BY MAN IN THE IMMEDIATE AGE OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE
DON'T YOU TALK ENGLISH SO DO THE AMERICANS MY LORD SAID I WITH A SMILE THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE GRACIOUS
AND I WAS AWARE THAT THOUGH CRASWELLER WAS MY SINCERE FRIEND HE HAD COME TO ENTERTAIN OF LATE AN ABSOLUTE HATRED OF ALL THOSE BEYOND MYSELF WHO HAD ADVOCATED HIS OWN DEPOSITION
DURING THE LAST MONTH OR TWO HE SEEMED TO BE MUCH OLDER THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE KNOWN HIM AND WAS NOW SEATED WITH HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND WITHIN HIS OWN
NO OPPOSITION EVER SHOWN TO COLUMBUS AND GALILEO HAD COME NEAR TO THIS IN AUDACITY AND OPPRESSION
HAD HE BEEN BLESSED WITH A SON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE WITH HIM SO I GOT ON TO MY STEAM-TRICYCLE AND IN A FEW MINUTES I WAS AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
I DECLINE TO GO TO MY OWN HOUSE I SAID
THE PRESIDENT I THINK WISHES TO SPEAK TO ME ON BUSINESS THEN SHE CAME UP AND LOOKED ME IN THE FACE AND PRESSED MY HAND AND I KNEW THAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR MERCY FOR HER FATHER
BOTH THESE ERRORS HAVE COME FROM AN ILL-JUDGED AND A THOUGHTLESS TENDERNESS,--A TENDERNESS TO THE YOUNG IN NOT CALLING UPON THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THE DECENT AND COMFORTABLE DEPARTURE OF THEIR PROGENITORS
BUT I DID FEEL THAT A NEW DIFFICULTY WOULD ARISE FROM THE EXTREME VENERATION PAID TO CERTAIN CHARACTERS
HE WAS SURE THAT LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN SHOWING ME MY CABINS AND THAT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ON BOARD WHICH I DID NOT FEEL TO BE COMFORTABLE IT SHOULD BE AT ONCE ALTERED
AND NOW I MUST CONFESS THAT AS I SAT ALONE IN MY LIBRARY I DID HESITATE FOR AN HOUR AS TO MY FUTURE CONDUCT
I FOUND THAT A PLACE OF HONOUR HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR ME TOO AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND ALSO ONE FOR MY WIFE AT HIS LEFT
READ SHAKESPEARE'S DESCRIPTION OF MAN IN HIS LAST STAGE SECOND CHILDISHNESS AND MERE OBLIVION SANS TEETH SANS EYES SANS TASTE SANS EVERYTHING AND THE STAGE BEFORE IS MERELY THAT OF THE LEAN AND SLIPPERED PANTALOON FOR HIS OWN SAKE WOULD YOU NOT SAVE MANKIND FROM HAVING TO ENCOUNTER SUCH MISERIES AS THESE YOU CAN'T DO IT MR PRESIDENT I VERY NEARLY DID DO IT
MINISTER OF THE DAY THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT TO GRANT THEIR REQUEST
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MAN INTENDS TO MARRY HER I CAN'T SEE WHY HE SHOULDN'T I REPLIED
NO OTHER REPUBLIC WOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND AGAINST THOSE HYDRA-HEADED PREJUDICES WITH WHICH THE IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD AT LARGE IS FORTIFIED
JACK SAID I WHAT A POOR STUPID LOVELORN BOY YOU ARE I DARESAY I AM SAID JACK MEEKLY
FOR ME I FEEL,--HAVE FELT FOR YEARS,--TEMPTED TO RUSH ON AND PASS THROUGH THE GATES OF DEATH
BUT TO ABSTRACT ARGUMENT AND TO POLITICAL TRUTH SHE IS WILFULLY BLIND
SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WAS MUCH STRUCK BY EVA'S BEAUTY AND LIVING AS HE DID IN CRASWELLER'S HOUSE SOON HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SO TELLING HER
WHAT I WANT TO EXPLAIN IS THAT I SHALL BE THERE MYSELF AND SHALL DO ALL THAT I CAN TO SUPPORT THE MEETING IN OPPOSITION TO YOUR FATHER SAID I
THEN THEY SENT THE CATAPULTS AWAY AND TRIED THE OLD-FASHIONED SLOW BOWLING
I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF ABSOLUTELY IMPOTENT DURING THEIR PROGRESS
HE WOULD THINK NOTHING OF BLOWING ME UP SO LONG AS HE OBEYED ORDERS I WAS GOING ON TO OBSERVE I CONTINUED THAT THOUGH THIS POWER IS IN YOUR HANDS AND IN THAT OF YOUR COUNTRY THE EXERCISE OF IT BETRAYS NOT ONLY TYRANNY OF DISPOSITION BUT POORNESS AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT I HERE BOWED FIRST TO THE ONE GENTLEMAN AND THEN TO THE OTHER
AND I SHOULD HARDLY BE DOING GOOD TO HIM WERE I TO FORCE HIM TO DEPART IN A FRAME OF MIND SO POOR AND PITEOUS
AND NOT ABOVE TWENTY OTHERS WHO COULD BE SAID TO BE APPROACHING IT
AND HAD SWORN TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT MORNING ABOUT THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR THAT HE WOULD KNOCK THAT BRUTE'S HEAD OFF HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE MANY DAYS WERE GONE BY
YOU HAVE GOT THE IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD AND YOU WILL NOT DROP IT
THAT'S JUST WHAT I FANCY THEY WILL DO DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT IT IS WHAT YOU WISH THEM TO DO,--THAT YOU THINK IT RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD DO IT I DON'T THINK CRASWELLER OUGHT TO BE DEPOSITED IF YOU MEAN THAT FATHER NOT THOUGH THE LAW REQUIRES IT THIS I SAID IN A TONE OF AUTHORITY
HE WAS A MAN WHO LOOKED AS THOUGH EVERYTHING WERE TO YIELD TO HIS MEAGRE PHILOSOPHY
AND HONESTY SIMPLE HONESTY WOULD FORBID IT
I MAY AS WELL STATE HERE THAT FROM THIS TIME ABRAHAM GRUNDLE SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE A DECLARED ENEMY AND THAT THE PARTNERSHIP WAS DISSOLVED BETWEEN CRASWELLER AND HIMSELF
JACK WAS VERY DESPONDENT AND HAD HAD SOME TIFF WITH EVA
ALL THIS I COULD HARDLY EXPLAIN TO HIM AS I SHOULD THUS BE GIVING TO HIM THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE AGAINST MY OWN PHILOSOPHY
HAD NOT THEY BELIEVED AND TRUSTED AND BEEN CONFIDENT
IT WOULD KEEP US OUT OF DEBT MAKE FOR US OUR RAILWAYS RENDER ALL OUR RIVERS NAVIGABLE CONSTRUCT OUR BRIDGES AND LEAVE US SHORTLY THE RICHEST PEOPLE ON GOD'S EARTH
GOVERNMENT CONSIDER THAT HIS ABSENCE FROM BRITANNULA SHALL BE FOR A TIME INSURED
AND AMONG BRITISH SAILORS THE OFFICERS ON BOARD H.M
I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS YOUNG MAN SAID I
AND IF HE WILL THINK A LITTLE MORE OF THE BUSINESS AND A LITTLE LESS OF CRICKET HE WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT HUSBAND OF COURSE HE HAD TO THINK A LITTLE OF THE MATCH WHEN THE ENGLISHMEN WERE HERE
YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN ONE WHOSE POSITION IN THE WORLD WAS MORE PITEOUS OR WHOSE DIFFICULTIES WERE MORE TRYING THEN I LEFT HIM AND WENT DOWN TO COMPLETE MY MANUSCRIPT
HE HAD NO GREAT IDEAS AS TO THE IMBECILITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN LIFE WHEN PROTRACTED BEYOND ITS FITTING LIMITS
HER VERY INDIGNATION ENDEARED ME TO HER AND MADE ME FEEL HOW EXCELLENT SHE WAS HOW NOBLE A WIFE SHE WOULD BE FOR MY SON
THE PRIME MINISTER IN DOWNING STREET WAS SEVENTY-TWO WHEN WE WERE DEBARRED FROM CARRYING OUT OUR PROJECT AND THE SECRETARY FOR THE COLONIES WAS SIXTY-NINE
IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN THE RECORDS AND UPON THE STONES BELONGING TO THE COLLEGE
BUT A TRAP-DOOR IN CERTAIN OF THE CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN BY ACCIDENT,--EITHER THAT OR BY AN ENEMY ON PURPOSE,--AND UNDOUBTEDLY SOME SLIGHT FLAVOUR OF THE PIG HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO ESCAPE
ON THAT SUNDAY MORNING WHEN HE AND HIS GIRL WERE AT CHURCH,--FOR CRASWELLER HAD STUCK TO THE OLD HABIT OF SAYING HIS PRAYERS IN A SPECIAL PLACE ON A SPECIAL DAY,--I HAD DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH YOUNG GRUNDLE
IT WAS A DIFFICULTY--A DIFFICULTY THE MORE
I WOULD NOT STIR IF I WERE YOU
BUT CRASWELLER WAS NO HERO
I HAD NO WISH TO GO TO WINDSOR
EXORS THE LAWYER WOULD SAY AT ONCE THAT WE DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT THE LAW
WITH THESE I INTENDED TO CALL AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AT NOON AND TO ACCOMPANY MR CRASWELLER UP TO THE COLLEGE SITTING ON HIS LEFT HAND
BUT TO SUCH CIVIL SPEECHES I COULD DO NO OTHER THAN MAKE CIVIL REPLIES
IF THE SOLDIERS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED THE SAILORS WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU IN HAND WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY THERE WAS THIS GREAT NECESSITY FOR KIDNAPPING ME HE ASSURED ME THAT FEELING IN ENGLAND HAD RUN VERY HIGH ON THE MATTER AND THAT SUNDRY BISHOPS HAD DECLARED THAT ANYTHING SO BARBAROUS COULD NOT BE PERMITTED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
I THINK THAT IN ENGLAND THEY THOUGHT THAT A FEW AND BUT A FEW AMONG US WERE DREAMERS OF A DREAM
BUT EVEN SPOKEN WORDS WOULD COME COLD TO ME AND WOULD FALL UNNOTICED ON THE HEARTS OF OTHERS WHEN IT WAS FELT THAT THE DOCTRINE ADVOCATED COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFECT ANY LIVING MAN
HE HAS GOT TEN YEARS OF WORK IN HIM SAID MY FRIEND AND YET YOU INTEND TO MAKE AWAY WITH HIM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST COMPUNCTION MAKE AWAY WITH HIM
SHOULD I HAVE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER TO PERFORM THE TASK IN OPPOSITION TO THE LOUDLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE INHABITANTS AND TO MARCH HIM ALONG PROTECTED BY A STRONG BODY OF VOLUNTEERS
THE FEW WISE SAID I HAVE EVER BEEN THE LAUGHING-STOCK OF SILLY CROWDS BUT EVA ISN'T ONE OF THE WISE SHE REPLIED AND WOULD BE LAUGHED AT WITHOUT HAVING ANY OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY TO SUPPORT HER
THE GIRL WE HAVE HAS GIVEN US NOTICE AND SHE IS THE NINTH WITHIN A YEAR
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND AND I WILL GO
I SUPPOSE WE MAY WALK DOWN
AT PRESENT WE MUST ALL AWAIT OUR DEATH FROM THE HANDS OF THE ALMIGHTY
I'VE TOLD YOU AS MUCH MR GRUNDLE AS IT IS FIT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW I REPLIED WITH SEVERITY
AND IT WAS SAID AFTERWARDS THAT GRUNDLE HAD BET FOUR TO ONE AGAINST HIS OWN SIDE
AND ONCE WHEN I SAW HER BY CHANCE TAKE A KISS FROM HER LOVER BEHIND THE DOOR I FELT THAT IT WAS A PITY INDEED THAT A MAN SHOULD EVER BECOME OLD
AND HER PASSION GOES ON INCREASING BECAUSE SHE CAN NEVER GET A WORD FROM ME
WE WERE SMALL BUT WE WERE INDEPENDENT AND OWED NO MORE OF SUBMISSION TO GREAT BRITAIN THAN WE DO TO THE SALOMON ISLANDS OR TO OTAHEITE
HE WILL TREAT YOU WITH ALL KIND OF RESPECT NO DOUBT IT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO YOU TO THINK SAID I WHERE HE WILL DEPOSIT ME
THEN JACK BEGAN
I TOLD THEM THAT I SHOULD START TO-MORROW AT NOON FOR ENGLAND UNDER A PROMISE MADE BY ME TO THEIR NEW GOVERNOR AND THAT I PURPOSED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM BEFORE I WENT UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD GIVEN THAT PROMISE AND WHAT IT WAS THAT I INTENDED TO DO WHEN I SHOULD REACH ENGLAND
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I WAS SPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO HEAR A DISTINGUISHED ENGLISHMAN LIKE LORD MARYLEBONE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WERE FOREIGNERS
THESE OLD MEN,--THE TANNER AND WHISKY-DEALER AND THE LIKE,--HAD SENT HOME TO ENGLAND TO GET ASSISTANCE AGAINST THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT
LET HIM COME ON BOARD WITH US THEY WERE VERY GRACIOUS
AND THEN THE SLY ROGUE HAD FOUND THE CERTAIN WAY TO OBTAIN OLD CRASWELLER'S CONSENT
IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO SAY THAT WE WOULD ADMIT NO FIRES INTO OUR ESTABLISHMENTS BECAUSE A LIFE HAD NOW AND AGAIN BEEN LOST BY FIRE AS TO USE SUCH AN ARGUMENT AS THAT NOW PUT FORWARD AGAINST THE FIXED PERIOD
HE TOO WOULD CLAMOROUSLY SWEAR THAT HE WAS MUCH YOUNGER AS DID THE OLD WOMEN
AND THEN AGAIN WHEN I THOUGHT OF HER PRAYERS AND OF THOSE STERN WORDS WHICH HAD FOLLOWED HER PRAYERS,--OF THAT CHARGE OF PRIDE AND VANITY,--I DID TELL MYSELF THAT PRIDE AND VANITY WERE NOT ABSENT
MY DEAR I WILL NOT DISCUSS MY FUTURE INTENTIONS BEFORE THE BOY
THESE WOULD FORM QUESTIONS WHICH IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ANSWER
BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT
I SHALL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT AND I DO NOT THINK THAT JACK IS MUCH WISER THAN I AM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY A SPEECH SARAH MY WIFE'S NAME IS SARAH
CRASWELLER SAID I ARE YOU NOT MAN ENOUGH TO DO THIS THING IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANLY MANNER ONE YEAR HE EXCLAIMED
TILL IT SEEMED THAT BICYCLE-RACING AND NOT CRICKET HAD BEEN THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE ENGLISH HAD SENT OUT THE 4000-TON STEAM-YACHT AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THE CRICKETERS OF THE NATION
BUT SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE TOWARDS EFFECTING IT
GREAT BRITAIN AT YOUR REQUEST SURRENDERED TO YOU THE POWER OF SELF-GOVERNMENT
OH JACK I PRAY FOR YOU
I HAD BEEN ALWAYS A MOST POPULAR MAGISTRATE BUT NOW IT SEEMED HAD COME THE TIME IN WHICH ALL MY POPULARITY MUST BE ABANDONED
AND VERY PLEASANT THE OFFICERS MADE IT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT CRASWELLER DID NOT SEE THE SMOKE
I ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT MYSELF WITH THESE NAMES,--BUT IN A VAIN DELUSIVE MANNER
AND DEAD OR ALIVE I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HAD YOU
I SHALL TELL EVA WHAT I THINK ABOUT HIM THE QUARREL WENT ON DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF PREPARATION TILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH GLADSTONOPOLIS HAD NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT
AND IT MUST BE OWNED THAT HE DID SO WITH GOOD WORDS AND WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YOUTHFUL ELOQUENCE
AND NO DOUBT HE WILL BE LOOKED CLOSELY AFTER
YOU NEVER EXPECTED THAT PEOPLE WOULD COME AND DEPOSIT THEMSELVES OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY EXPECTS THAT THE CITIZENS OF BRITANNULA WILL OBEY THE LAW BUT THERE WAS ONE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK MR PRESIDENT
THEN SIR FERDINANDO TOLD HIS WHOLE STORY WHICH I THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN DECLARED BEFORE I HAD BEEN ASKED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH THE CAPTAIN ON BOARD THE SHIP
BUT THEY HAD NOT YIELDED WHEN THINGS HAD GONE AGAINST THEM
GRUNDLE WANTS TO GET RID OF ME GRUNDLE I FEAR HAS TRUTH ON HIS SIDE SAID I DETERMINED TO SHOW HIM THAT I AT ANY RATE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEND MYSELF TO THE FURTHERANCE OF A FALSEHOOD
OR IF NOT THAT WAS THERE NOT SOMETHING PERSONAL TO MYSELF IN MY DESIRE THAT I SHOULD BE KNOWN AS ONE WHO HAD BENEFITED MY SPECIES
BUT YOU STILL AGREE WITH ME AS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH OF OUR DOCTRINE I SUPPOSE SO SAID CRASWELLER
HE TOOK NO PART IN POLITICS
ACCORDING TO WHAT MY WIFE HAD SAID JACK WOULD HAVE JUMPED AT THE GIRL WITH JUST WHAT SHE STOOD UP IN
HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT THERE ARE ONLY NINE YEARS BETWEEN HIM AND ME TEN MR PRESIDENT
BUT SUDDENLY THERE CAME UPON ME A MEMORY OF SOCRATES OF GALILEO OF HAMPDEN AND OF WASHINGTON
AND I WAS TOLD BY A GENTLEMAN WHO SAT NEXT TO ME SCORING THAT A DOZEN RUNS HAD BEEN MADE
WE DID KNOW THAT SIR KENNINGTON HAD BEEN VERY ATTENTIVE BUT THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT THAT MEANS FROM YOU FOREIGN GENTLEMEN
BUT HE DID NOT AT PRESENT GO INTO CRASWELLER'S HOUSE AND THE WHOLE FASHIONABLE COMMUNITY OF GLADSTONOPOLIS WAS BEGINNING TO ENTERTAIN THE OPINION THAT THAT MATCH WAS OFF
AND IF SOME DEED BE FORTHCOMING BY WHICH LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH SHALL HAVE BEEN LEFT TO TRUSTEES
HAD HE BEEN IN MY PLACE AND HAD ENTERTAINED MY CONVICTIONS I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE DEPOSITED CRASWELLER IN SPITE OF SIR FERDINANDO BROWN AND CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
WHO'S TO STAND A DAUGHTER INTERCEDING FOR THE LIFE OF HER FATHER ONE MAN CANNOT BUT EIGHTY-FIVE CAN DO SO THE EIGHTY-FIVE WILL BE TO THE COMMUNITY JUST WHAT THE ONE WOULD BE TO THE EIGHTY-FIVE
I TELL YOU WHAT IT IS NEVERBEND SAID HE
AND THE GENERAL FEELING THAT THE BUSINESS AND PLEASURES OF LIFE WERE OVER AND THAT THE STILLNESS OF THE GRAVE HAD BEEN COMMENCED
HE DID SAY WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING THAT HIS PERMISSION WOULD GO FOR NOTHING AS HE WAS ABOUT TO BE LED AWAY AND DEPOSITED
THEN THE BELLS WERE RUNG AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY REJOICED AND BANQUETS WERE EATEN AND THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN CALLED EACH OTHER BROTHER AND SISTER AND IT WAS FELT THAT A GREAT REFORM HAD BEEN INAUGURATED AMONG US FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND AT LARGE
TO HAVE LIBERATED CRASWELLER AT THIS MOMENT I WOULD HAVE WALKED OFF MYSELF OH SO WILLINGLY TO THE COLLEGE
YOU HAVE NOT IN TRUTH BEEN TRIED WOULD THAT YOU COULD TRY ME AND WE ARE NOT ALL MADE OF SUCH STUFF AS YOU
THERE WAS A COAXING SWEET FEMININE WAY WITH HER WHICH OVERCAME ALL OPPOSITION
HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BEFORE WE LEFT NEW ZEALAND AND WAS CHILDLESS WHEN HE MADE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE HIS HOMESTEAD AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
I AM YOUR SENIOR TEN YEARS I BELIEVE ABOUT NINE I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE COME FROM A MISTAKE OF HIS AS TO MY EXACT AGE
I THINK I MUST BEGIN MY STORY BY EXPLAINING IN MODERATE LANGUAGE A FEW OF THE MANIFEST ADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD ATTEND THE ADOPTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD IN ALL COUNTRIES
THE MOMENT HAD NOW COME IN WHICH I MIGHT SUCCEED
BUT THEY THOUGHT SO BADLY OF HIM THAT THEY MADE HIM SWALLOW POISON
EVA IS NOT AT HOME I HAVE JUST PARTED WITH HER AT MY OWN HOUSE
ON THE NEXT DAY SOME OF US WENT ON BOARD THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR A RETURN DINNER
I BELIEVED AFTERWARDS THAT WHEN THE TIME HAD COME I SHOULD HAVE FOUND MYSELF INCAPACITATED FOR THE OPERATION
AS I LEARNED BY THE LETTERS WHICH EVA WROTE TO ME CRASWELLER WAS ALL THROUGH MOST ANXIOUS TO PAY HIM
MY FIXED PERIOD IS 1990 EXACTLY
BECAUSE A YOUNG BOY HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A PRETTY GIRL THE WHOLE WEALTH OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE USED FOR A MOST NEFARIOUS PURPOSE AND A GREAT NATION WAS TO EXERCISE ITS TYRANNY OVER A SMALL ONE IN WHICH HER OWN LANGUAGE WAS SPOKEN AND HER OWN CUSTOMS FOLLOWED
BUT THEN THE FIRST COMER IS NOT I HAD NOT SAID MUCH TO HIM DURING THE LATTER MONTHS AS TO CRASWELLER IN PARTICULAR
COULD IT BE THAT EVA WAS WAVING IT SO AS TO COMFORT HER VANQUISHED BRITISH LOVER
FROM THE HOURS INTENDED FOR SLUMBER A FEW MINUTES COULD BE TAKEN FOR SAYING ADIEU TO MY WIFE
FOR ME TO STRIKE A BARGAIN WITH ONE ALREADY DESTINED FOR DEPOSITION,--THAT HE SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM HIS GLORIOUS HIS ALMOST IMMORTAL STATE ON THE PAYMENT OF A BRIBE TO ME AND MY FAMILY
CRASWELLER IT MUST BE DONE
HE ALLUDED TO THE FIXED PERIOD DEBATE WHICH HE KNEW WOULD BE RENEWED AS SOON AS THE CRICKETERS WERE GONE
IMPUDENT PUPPY
THIS SUGGESTION THAT HE MIGHT RUN AWAY AS THE DAY OF HIS DEPOSITION DREW NIGH,--OR RATHER THAT OTHERS MIGHT RUN AWAY,--HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SOME CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND ME
AS PRESIDENT I HAD STILL TWO YEARS TO RUN BUT IT OCCURRED TO ME NOW THAT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY ENDURE THOSE TWO YEARS OF PROLONGED NOMINAL POWER
I HAD NOT AS YET HEARD OF THIS MATCH NOR OF THE COMING OF OUR ARISTOCRATIC VISITOR
I SAY IT IS IT IS NOT SO
I SHOULD LEAD YOU IN WITH THAT PERFECT REVERENCE WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE YOUNG SHOULD FEEL FOR THE OLD WHEN THEY BECOME FEEBLE AND INCAPABLE I DOUBT NOW WHETHER HE RELISHED THESE ALLUSIONS TO HIS OWN SECLUSION
HE HAS WITH HIM HOWEVER A COMPANY OF A CELEBRATED ENGLISH REGIMENT WITH ITS ATTENDANT OFFICERS WHO BY THEIR RED COATS AND LONG SWORDS WILL NO DOUBT ADD TO THE CHEERFULNESS OF YOUR SOCIAL GATHERINGS
GRUNDLE WANTED TO FIX-PERIOD OLD CRASWELLER FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROPERTY
BUT HE CAN MAKE HIS WILL UP TO THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH HE IS DEPOSITED HE HAD THEN ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS TO RUN
VERY WELL SAID I LEAVING THE ROOM
ONE HOUSE I HOLD TO BE QUITE SUFFICIENT I WAS PROCEEDING TO EXPLAIN THE THEORY ON WHICH THE BRITANNULAN CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN FORMED WHEN SIR FERDINANDO INTERRUPTED ME
AND THE LOWING OF MY FLOCKS AND THE BLEATING OF MY SHEEP ARE SO GRACIOUS IN MY EARS AND IT IS SO SWEET TO MY EYES TO SEE HOW FAIRLY I HAVE TURNED THIS WILDERNESS INTO A PARADISE THAT I OWN THAT I WOULD FAIN STAY HERE A LITTLE LONGER BUT THE LAW MY FRIEND THE LAW,--THE LAW WHICH YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN SO ACTIVE IN CREATING THE LAW ALLOWS ME TWO YEARS YET SAID HE
BUT IT SEEMED AS I WATCHED THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS MADE FOR CARRYING ON TWO OR THREE DAYS PLAY AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH THAT ENGLAND MUST BE SENDING OUT ANOTHER ARMY TO TAKE ANOTHER SEBASTOPOL
THE MORNING CAME,--THE 30TH OF JUNE,--A BRIGHT CLEAR WINTER MORNING COLD BUT STILL GENIAL AND PLEASANT AS I GOT INTO THE BAROUCHE AND HAD MYSELF DRIVEN TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
I SUPPOSE A YOUNG WOMAN MAY CHANGE HER MIND IN BRITANNULA AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE SAID MY WIFE
I BELIEVE YOU'RE AWARE THAT I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY MISS CRASWELLER IT MAY BE AS WELL TO EXPLAIN HERE THAT MY OWN ELDEST SON AS FINE A BOY AS EVER DELIGHTED A MOTHER'S EYE WAS ONLY TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN EVA AND THAT MY WIFE MRS NEVERBEND HAD OF LATE GOT IT INTO HER HEAD THAT HE WAS QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO MARRY THE GIRL
HE HAD DINED THERE FREQUENTLY AND HAD SLEPT ON BOARD
VARIOUS NAMES HAD BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE SITE
THE COLLEGE WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM THE TOWN AT THE SIDE OPPOSITE TO YOU AS YOU ENTER THE TOWN FROM LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND I HAD SOME TIME SINCE MADE UP MY MIND HOW IN THE BRIGHT GENIAL DAYS OF OUR PLEASANT WINTER I WOULD MYSELF ACCOMPANY MR CRASWELLER THROUGH THE CITY IN AN OPEN BAROUCHE AS I TOOK HIM TO BE DEPOSITED THROUGH ADMIRING CROWDS OF HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS
HIS SHEEP HAD GREATLY INCREASED IN NUMBER
A WEEK WAS NECESSARY TO RECRUIT THEIR STRENGTH AND TO ENABLE THEM TO PACK UP THEIR BATS AND BICYCLES
AT ANY RATE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT A SECOND CHAMBER IS NOT THERE TO GUARD AGAINST THE SUDDEN ACTION OF THE FIRST
HAD YOU LISTENED TO YOUNG GRUNDLE INSISTING WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE OF YOUTH ON THE ABSOLUTE WRETCHEDNESS TO WHICH THE AGED HAD BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH LAW,--HAD YOU HEARD THE MISERIES OF RHEUMATISM GOUT STONE AND GENERAL DEBILITY PICTURED IN THE ELOQUENT WORDS OF FIVE-AND-TWENTY,--YOU WOULD HAVE FELT THAT ALL WHO COULD LEND THEMSELVES TO PERPETUATE SUCH A STATE OF THINGS MUST BE GUILTY OF FIENDISH CRUELTY
HE SAT ON MRS NEVERBEND'S LEFT HAND AND DID SEEM IN SOME RESPECT TO BE THE CHIEF MAN ON THAT OCCASION
HE HADN'T QUITE IMPETUS ENOUGH ON TO MAKE THE TURNING SHARP AS HE OUGHT SAID JACK WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST APPARENT REGRET AT WHAT HAD OCCURRED
AND THEREFORE IN DISCUSSING WITH HIM AS I DID DAILY THE QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD I PROMISED HIM THAT IT SHOULD BE MY LOT TO DEPOSIT HIM IN THE SACRED COLLEGE WHEN THE DAY OF HIS WITHDRAWAL SHOULD HAVE COME
WHEN IT HAD BEEN SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD AT THE MOMENT BE CARRIED ON BOARD,--WHICH MIGHT NO DOUBT THEN HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE SOLDIERS,--I HAD SAID THAT IF A CERTAIN TIME WERE ALLOWED ME I WOULD AGAIN BE FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE
I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT HAD HE BEEN STANCH TO ME AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DEPOSITED NOT ONLY WILLINGLY BUT JOYFULLY HE WOULD HAVE SET AN EXAMPLE WHICH COULD NOT BUT HAVE BEEN EFFICACIOUS
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES HAS SEALED ORDERS AND IS PRACTICALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE MECHANISM OF THE GUN
IT WOULD APPEAR ABSURD TO SAY THAT HAD THERE BEEN SUCH A LAW IN FORCE IN ENGLAND ENGLAND WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED ITS ADOPTION IN BRITANNULA
IT'S THE WAY WE ALL SPEAK OF IT AND WHAT DID HE SAY WELL HE WENT TO WORK AND THE JOHN BRIGHT WAS SENT OUT HERE
WHAT ON EARTH IS THERE TO HINDER IT I SAID ONCE TO MY OLD FRIEND RUGGLES
FOR A TIME NO DOUBT BRITISH TENDERNESS WILL PREVAIL
HIS VOICE SHALL HAVE DESCENDED TO A POOR TREBLE OR HIS EYESIGHT SHALL BE DIM AND FAILING
HE HAD HEARD A FEW VOICES IN THE HALL WHICH UNDER FEAR OF DEATH HAD EXPRESSED THEIR DISLIKE TO THE FIXED PERIOD
I WENT TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND THERE I FOUND MR CRASWELLER WAITING FOR ME IN THE HALL
BUT HE LEANED FORWARD AND HE BIT HIS LIP AND I SAW THAT HIS RIGHT HAND SHOOK AS IT GRASPED THE ARM OF THE CARRIAGE
BUT HE ASSURED ME TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE ADDRESSED ME THAT HIS OBJECT HAD BEEN TO PAY HIS LAST RESPECTS TO THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
I WAS AS CONFIDENT AS HE ON THE OTHER SIDE,--OR AT ANY RATE PRETENDED TO BE SO,--AND TOLD HIM THAT HE MADE NO ALLOWANCE FOR THE PROGRESSIVE WISDOM OF MANKIND
AND SO ALSO DID THE LOVES OF ABRAHAM GRUNDLE AND EVA CRASWELLER
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HAD HIS TIME COME AS NIGH AS THAT OF CRASWELLER HE TOO LIKE CRASWELLER WOULD IMPOTENTLY IMPLORE THE GRACE OF ANOTHER YEAR
I THEN RECEIVED VIOLENT NOTICE FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT BRITANNULA HAD CEASED TO BE INDEPENDENT AND HAD AGAIN BEEN ABSORBED BY THE MOTHER COUNTRY AMONG THE CROWN COLONIES
WE ALL THOUGHT SO UP AT THE WAREHOUSE SAID HE,--"I AND FATHER AND GRABBE AND POSTLECOTT OUR CHIEF CLERK
THE VERY AMUSEMENTS OF THE OLD MEN HAD BEEN SANCTIONED
IN AN AFFAIR OF IMPORTANCE OF THIS KIND THAT IS THE SAME AS TO-MORROW
HOWEVER HE PROPOSED MRS NEVERBEND'S HEALTH AND THE LADIES AND THE CAPTAIN INSTANTLY CALLED UPON THE BAND TO PLAY SOME FAVOURITE TUNE
BUT THEY REGARDED IT AS THOUGH A GREAT NATIONAL COMBAT HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND THE BRITANNULISTS LOOKED UPON THEMSELVES AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS AGAINST ENGLAND
BUT WE SHOULD SAVE ON AN AVERAGE L50 FOR EACH MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD DEPARTED
AND THEY ENTER ONLY ON THE MINDS OF THE STUDIOUS WHEREAS THE OTHERS TOUCH THE FEELINGS OF THE WORLD AT LARGE
IT MIGHT BE THAT HE WAS LAMENTING FOR HIS ENGLISH FRIENDS WHO WERE GONE AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT SPEAK
ITS ADOPTION WAS THE FIRST THING DISCUSSED BY OUR YOUNG ASSEMBLY WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES ALONE
THIS HAD OCCURRED TO ME OFTEN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE AGITATION
I HAD NO RIGHT TO BE ANGRY WITH CRASWELLER BECAUSE CRASWELLER WHEN TRIED PROVED HIMSELF TO BE NO STRONGER THAN THE WORLD AT LARGE
SHE HAD ON ONE OF THOSE ROUND CLOSE-FITTING MEN'S HATS WHICH LADIES NOW WEAR BUT UNDER IT WAS A VEIL WHICH QUITE HID HER FACE
OUR VOYAGE TO ENGLAND
OUR VOYAGE TO ENGLAND
OH MR NEVERBEND SHE SAID I HOPE YOU DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE BEEN UNKIND IT IS I MY DEAR WHO SHOULD EXPRESS THAT HOPE I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN HOW WELL YOU HAVE LOVED MY DEAR FATHER
BARRING THAT I NEVER SPENT A PLEASANTER TWO MONTHS IN MY LIFE AND SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL UNWILLING TO STAY FOR ANOTHER
HAD ALL THE TOWN TURNED OUT IN YOUR FAVOUR AND HAD THIS GENTLEMAN INSISTED ON BEING CARRIED AWAY TO BE BURIED NOTHING OF THAT KIND SAID CRASWELLER
BUT THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT HAS BECOME SO COMMON IN BRITANNULA THAT BUT LITTLE IS THOUGHT OF IT
BUT I KNOW THAT OUR STEAM-BOWLER WILL BEAT THEIR CATAPULT HOLLOW
IT WAS SO OF SOME NO DOUBT
IT MAY BE ALL VERY WELL AS FAR AS STATE WISDOM GOES
WILL NOT EVA COME WITH US I SAID
AND HOW PLEASANT NOW WERE THE VERY SOUNDS OF THEIR NAMES TO ALL WHO LOVED THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES
BUT I HAD INTENDED TO ALLUDE TO THE PRESUMED MAJESTY ATTACHED TO THE HIGHEST COUNCIL IN THE STATE
WILL TWELVE O'CLOCK SUIT YOU TO-DAY I SHOUTED
EVEN YOUR SYMPATHY CANNOT BRING US ROUND NOW
IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO AN ACCUSATION OF COWARDICE AGAINST THE WHOLE EMPIRE CRASWELLER HAD ONLY SHAKEN HIS HEAD
INDEED IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS PECULIARLY HAPPY AT THIS TIME FOR HE DID NOT GO TO HIS OFFICE
ANOTHER INCH AND A HALF WOULD HAVE SAVED HIM
AS I WENT BACK TO GLADSTONOPOLIS I DID THINK OF IT AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO MY MIND WAVERED
THE MODERN GALILEO SIR
LIKE A HIGHWAYMAN IT WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR YOU MERELY TO TELL THE WEAK AND COWARDLY THAT YOUR PISTOL WOULD BE MADE TO GO OFF WHEN WANTED
THEY WOULD BE ENGLISHMEN WITH NO IDEAS BEYOND THOSE CURRENT IN THE LAST CENTURY AND WOULD BE ALTOGETHER DEAF TO THE WISDOM OF THE FIXED PERIOD
I HAD LOVED HIM THE BETTER BECAUSE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO COMMENCE MY EXPERIMENT ON HIS BODY
I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE OUT MY OWN TIME THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSEMBLY MEN HAVE ON YOUR SHOULDERS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECIDING WHETHER I SHALL DO SO OR NOT
OUR KETTLE-DRUMS HAD HAD BUT LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING THEMSELVES HEARD
MOTHER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GONE TOO SAID JACK
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEPOSIT MR CRASWELLER,--NOT IF YOU TRY IT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
CRASWELLER HAD DECLARED THAT HUMAN NATURE COULD NOT ENDURE IT
THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS COLONIAL OFFICE CROWN COLONIES 15TH MAY 1980
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO HEAR THE WAY WITH WHICH SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF AT THE MEETING HELD ABOUT THE RISING BUILDINGS OF THE COLLEGE WHEN SHE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN
THAT IN ITSELF IS SOMETHING
LOOK AT CRASWELLER
AS I GOT BACK TO GLADSTONOPOLIS I HAD ALREADY A GLIMMERING OF AN IDEA THAT WE MUST BEGIN WITH HUMAN NATURE SOMEWHAT EARLIER AND TEACH MEN FROM THEIR VERY INFANCY TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR THE UNDOUBTED BLESSINGS OF THE FIXED PERIOD
AND YET THIS WAS PAID TO ME TO-DAY AT ONE OF YOUR BANKS AND THE LADY CASHIER ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD TAKE SOVEREIGNS
HE ROSE TO MEET ME AND I SAW THAT HE WAS A HANDSOME TALL MAN ABOUT FORTY WITH A DETERMINED FACE AND A WINNING SMILE
YOU HAVE HEARD MY ORDER I SAID AND YOU CAN HAVE TO-MORROW TO THINK ABOUT IT
THEY MUST HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES THE QUESTION WHETHER THEY WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THEIR GREAT REFORMS AGAINST THE WORLD
I THINK REPLIED I THAT YOU AND I AS LOYAL CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC ARE BOUND TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WILL DO HIS DUTY AS A CITIZEN THEN I WENT LEAVING HIM STANDING IN DOUBT AT HIS DOOR
AS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE CLEARLY NECESSARY
AND NOW HE CONTINUED WILL YOU ANSWER ME ONE QUESTION A DOZEN IF IT SUITS YOU TO ASK THEM CAPTAIN BATTLEAX CANNOT REMAIN HERE LONG WITH THAT EXPENSIVE TOY WHICH HE KEEPS LOCKED UP SOMEWHERE AMONG HIS COCKED-HATS AND WHITE GLOVES
OR SHALL I NOT MOST TRULY SAY OF BOTH?--AND I PERSUADED MY FELLOW-CITIZENS TO UNDERTAKE THIS SAD WORK OF THE FIXED PERIOD
THEREFORE IT WAS THAT I REJECTED JACK'S KIND OFFER
SIX MONTHS PASSED AWAY WHICH I MUST OWN TO ME WAS A PERIOD OF GREAT DOUBT AND UNHAPPINESS THOUGH IT WAS RELIEVED BY CERTAIN MOMENTS OF TRIUMPH
I WANT TO SAY A WORD TO YOU MR PRESIDENT HE BEGAN UPON A SUBJECT THAT DISTURBS MY CONSCIENCE VERY MUCH YOUR CONSCIENCE SAID I
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT MY GRANDFATHER SHOULD COMMIT A MURDER BUT HE WOULD BE HANGED
IT MAY BE THAT HE WHO JUDGES OF US WITH A WISDOM WHICH I CANNOT APPROACH SHALL TAKE ALL THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT HE SHALL SO MOULD MY FUTURE BEING AS TO FIT IT TO THE BEST AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED IN THIS WORLD
HE AND I HAD PARTED,--PERHAPS FOR EVER
WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS BUT FIVE OR SIX MILES OUT OF TOWN HE REQUESTED MY PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
WHAT I SAID
THE GENTLEMAN WAS NAMED SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
BUT THEN I WAS ALSO ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF JACK FOR A SHORT TIME
WHAT HONESTER MAN IS THERE WHOM YOU KNOW IN THIS COMMUNITY OF OURS
SHE HAS A QUICK INSIGHT AND AN AFFECTIONATE HEART WHICH TOGETHER KEEP HER FROM GOING ASTRAY
HE OWNS THREE CASTLES AND HALF A COUNTY AND HAS HALF A MILLION A-YEAR
IF I'VE ONLY GOT SOMEBODY JUST TO SPEAK TO SOMETIMES THAT WILL BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR ME
BUT THERE I WAS PLANTED ALONE,--THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC LEFT ON THE TOP OF THE HILL IN HIS CARRIAGE WITHOUT MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
THEY LEFT THE LAND'S END THREE WEEKS AGO LAST TUESDAY AT TWO AND LONDON AT HALF-PAST TEN
AND INDEED WAS I SURE OF MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT SO
I HAD NO DOUBT SUGGESTED THAT I MYSELF WOULD USE THE LANCET IN ORDER TO SAVE HIM FROM ANY LESS FRIENDLY TOUCH
BUT JACK IS RESOLUTE AND WILL NEVER YIELD ON ANY POINT
SO SAID I TO MYSELF BECAUSE OF JACK AND HIS LOVE ALL THE ASPIRATIONS OF MY LIFE ARE TO BE CRUSHED
BUT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD SHOW A DETERMINED FRONT TO OLD GRAYBODY AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT I AT ANY RATE WAS DETERMINED TO REMAIN FIRM TO MY PURPOSE
HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT MEN AND WOMEN WILL SMELL LIKE
I MUST ON MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND REMODEL ALTOGETHER THE FIXED PERIOD AND NAME A DAY SO FAR REMOVED THAT EVEN JACK'S CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT
WHETHER BARNES AND TALLOWAX WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED PEACEABLY MAY BE DOUBTED
IF HE ONLY TOUCHED THE SPRING WE ABOUT THE LOCALITY HERE WOULD BE KNOCKED INTO LITTLE BITS IN LESS TIME THAN IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT
IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO A WEAK LIE
WHEN THE ASSEMBLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH MY ADVICE HAD FIRST ENACTED THE LAW OF THE FIXED PERIOD A LARGE SUM HAD BEEN VOTED FOR THESE BUILDINGS
THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH I OUGHT TO ASK MYSELF
BUT IN ANSWER TO THAT WE STATED THAT WE WERE PREPARED TO STAND AND FALL BY THE NEW SYSTEM--THAT WE EXPECTED GLORY RATHER THAN IGNOMINY AND TO BE FOLLOWED BY MANKIND RATHER THAN REPUDIATED
THAT WAS JUST THE THING
OF COURSE I AM ALTOGETHER ON YOUR SIDE AND DO NOT WISH TO RAISE DIFFICULTIES
I NEVER FELT SURE OF THAT NOR DO I NOW
I'M NOT SURE THAT FOR MYSELF I WANT TO BE CHEERFUL ANYWHERE
I REMAINED ALONE TILL ONE O'CLOCK AND SPENT FOUR HOURS EVERY MORNING DURING OUR ENTIRE JOURNEY IN COMPOSING THIS VOLUME AS IT IS NOW PRINTED
AND NOW SAID SIR FERDINANDO THAT THIS MATTER IS SETTLED BETWEEN US ALLOW ME MOST CORDIALLY TO SHAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND TO EXPRESS MY GREAT ADMIRATION FOR YOUR CHARACTER
I FELT THAT HIS COMING TO ME AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS KIND BECAUSE I HAD BEEN AS IT WERE DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
THEY HAVE TO BE NOURISHED IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY DO GOOD WORK AS THEIR TIME SHALL COME
I HAD HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED JACK OR PERHAPS GRUNDLE DURING THE INTERVAL,--NOT HAVING FORESEEN THAT THE YEAR WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BE ONE OF HONOUR AND GLORY SHOULD BECOME A TIME OF MOURNING AND TRIBULATION
IT WAS SO LONG BEFORE WE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO STAND ON OUR BOTTOM THAT THE FIXED PERIOD BECAME A MATTER OF COMMON CONVERSATION IN BRITANNULA
AFTER ALL YOU HAVE A FULL TWELVE MONTHS YET BEFORE THE DAY SHALL HAVE COME TWO YEARS HE SAID DOGGEDLY
IN OTHER RESPECTS YOUR LAWS AND THOSE OF GREAT BRITAIN ARE NEARLY THE SAME
I AM TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF THE PAST AND THE PRESENT,--OF YOUR PAST CONSTITUTION AND OF THAT WHICH IT IS MY PURPOSE TO INAUGURATE HERE THERE AROSE A MURMUR THROUGH THE ROOM VERY AUDIBLE AND THREATENING BY ITS SOUNDS TO DISTURB THE ORATOR
HAVE YOU EVER BETHOUGHT YOURSELF THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE IN ALL THINGS OH MR PRESIDENT PRAY DO NOT MAKE A SPEECH HERE SAID MY WIFE
THE MURDERER IS THE MAN WHO ILLEGALLY KILLS
EVERY DAY GROWING SHORTER DAY BY DAY AND EVERY SEASON MONTH BY MONTH
THERE WAS A CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE NO DOUBT AND GRUNDLE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO TAKE A QUARTER OF THE FATHER'S POSSESSIONS IF HE COULD PROVE THAT THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN BROKEN
BUT HE SHAN'T FIND THAT I AM SO EASY TO DEAL WITH
BUT HE SEEMED TO ENTERTAIN NO AVERSION AT ALL TO SIR KENNINGTON OVAL
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNDIGNIFIED IN THE SOUND,--AS THOUGH WE WERE TALKING OF A DANCING SALOON OR A MUSIC HALL,--AND I WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT
I HAD SPENT THE MORNING OF THAT DAY IN PREPARING FOR MY DEPARTURE AND IN SO ARRANGING MATTERS WITH MY CLERKS THAT THE ENTRANCE OF SIR FERDINANDO ON HIS NEW DUTIES MIGHT BE EASY
THEN THERE IS THE LAW SAID I WITH AS I FELT UNFLINCHING HARDNESS
CRASWELLER SAID I LET US KEEP THESE TWO THINGS SEPARATE
YOUR PERIOD NOW WILL SOON HAVE BEEN REACHED AND I THINK IT WELL THAT WE AS DEAR LOVING FRIENDS SHOULD LEARN TO DISCUSS THE MATTER CLOSELY AS IT DRAWS NEARER
WHEN WE HAD PAID ALL HONOUR TO THE DEPARTING VESSEL I WENT AT ONCE TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND THERE I FOUND MY FRIEND IN THE VERANDAH WITH EVA
IT WAS MOST INDECENT SHE SAID
SIR I SAID AFTER A PAUSE AND TURNING TO CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND ADDRESSING HIM I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU AS AN OFFICER IN THE BRITISH NAVY WILL COMMIT ANY ACT OF TYRANNY SO OPPRESSIVE AND OF INJUSTICE SO GROSS AS THAT WHICH THIS GENTLEMAN HAS NAMED YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
BUT NOT PERHAPS ALL IN VAIN AS FAR AS THE WORLD WAS CONCERNED
IT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY WHEN THE SHIP LETS GO HER ANCHOR TO POINT THE GUN IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER SHE WON'T GO OFF WILL SHE ASKED BUNNIT
WHEN THERE TIDINGS REACHED ME OF A MUCH SADDER NATURE
BUT I CAN SEE INDICATIONS OF IT
AND CRASWELLER NO DOUBT CONCLUDED THAT GRUNDLE WOULD BE UNWILLING TO BEAR THE ODIUM OF BEING THE FIRST
AND HE MIGHT LEAVE HIS PROPERTY TO TRUSTEES WHO WOULD MANAGE IT ON HIS BEHALF
AND MOREOVER I CERTAINLY DID WISH TO GO
THERE AROSE IN THE HALL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CLAMOUR IN THE MIDST OF WHICH SIR FERDINANDO SAT DOWN
CRASWELLER TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED DOWN THE HILL WITH THE OFFICERS,--ALL THE CROWD ACCOMPANYING THEM
IT HAD BEEN ALREADY ASSERTED BY MANY THAT A GIRL COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO MARRY THE MAN WHO HAD ENDEAVOURED TO DESTROY HER FATHER
IT WILL BE ALL NEW AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY FOR YOU TO SEE YOU WILL GO UPON SOME OTHER VOYAGE YES
THERE MRS NEVERBEND AND JACK AND AFTER A WHILE EVA SAT TOGETHER IN PERPETUAL COUNCIL AGAINST ME
AND HE TELEGRAPHED TO HIS UNCLE WHO IS SECRETARY FOR BENEVOLENCE OR SOME SUCH THING AT HOME ENGLAND IS NOT YOUR HOME SAID I
GRUNDLE DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF PROCEEDING AGAINST OLD CRASWELLER IN REFERENCE TO THE BREACH OF CONTRACT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF BRITANNULA
YES YOU WOULD AFTER YOU HAD GOT USED TO IT HERE HE LOOKED VERY INCREDULOUS
CAN IT BE THAT HE WHO CREATED US SHOULD HAVE INTENDED THAT WE SHOULD SO REGARD OUR DISMISSAL FROM THE WORLD
I WAS HAPPY IN THE PRAISES OF ALL MY FELLOW-CITIZENS
I SHOULD BE REGARDED AS ABSOLUTELY A TRAITOR TO MY COUNTRY IF I WERE TO LEAVE BRITANNULA WHILE THIS IS GOING ON
BUT HE SHOWED A DISINCLINATION TO DISCUSS IT SO INVINCIBLE THAT I WAS SILENCED
I TOLD HIM THAT HE CERTAINLY MIGHT IF HE HAD A VEHICLE READY AND WAS READY TO USE IT
AND WE DID LOOK FORWARD TO SOME LITTLE CONFUSION IN THIS MATTER
WHAT SORT OF WIND WILL BE BLOWING NEXT FRIDAY AT TWO O'CLOCK ASKED SIR LORDS LONGSTOP
HE HAD NOW LEFT IT FOR ME TO DECIDE WHETHER HE SHOULD BE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE
WHO CAN BE MORE ALIVE THAN YOU I SAID TO THE FACT THAT MAN BY THE FEAR OF DEATH IS DEGRADED BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE BRUTES IF SO HE IS DEGRADED SAID CRASWELLER
BUT WHEN WE WERE ONCE INDEPENDENT THEN AGAIN TO REDUCE US TO SUBMISSION BY A 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER WAS AN ACT OF GROSS TYRANNY
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY WOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THE DUKE IS A MAN YES HE'S A MAN NO DOUBT IF HE COMMITTED MURDER HE WOULD BE HANGED IN SPITE OF HIS DUKEDOM I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD BE SAID LORD ALFRED HESITATING
MR NEVERBEND HE SAID LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--I HAVE TO-DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE GREAT PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING AN INTELLIGENT CONCOURSE OF CITIZENS IN BRITANNULA
A GIRL SAID SHE SHOULDN'T GET HERSELF TALKED ABOUT IN THAT WAY BY EVERY ONE ALL ROUND
HE WENT OVER WITH HIS STEAM CURRICLE AND SENT TO ASK EVA WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT TAKE A DRIVE WITH HIM ON THE CLIFFS SHE NEEDN'T HAVE GONE UNLESS SHE WISHED IT I SAID
IT WAS PITEOUS TO SEE THE EXERTIONS WHICH POOR MR BRITTLEREED MADE IN RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE GROUND
BUT I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED ME ON BOARD WITH VIOLENCE OR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PUT ALL GLADSTONOPOLIS TO THE SWORD BECAUSE I DECLINED TO GO ON BOARD BROWN HAD TOLD US THAT WE WERE TO BRING YOU OFF DEAD OR ALIVE
I HAVE EVER THOUGHT MORE OF THE GLORY OF OUR RACE THAN OF PUTTING FORWARD MY OWN INDIVIDUAL SELF,--AS MAY BE SEEN BY THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
MADE ONE RUN WHEREAS HE MIGHT HAVE MADE TWO AND THEN HAD TO BEGIN THE WAR OVER
NEXT TO THE SAILOR CAME THE SOLDIER AS HAVING SOME KINDRED EMPLOYMENT
THEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND WITH HER EYES RAISED TO HEAVEN AND WITH A HALO OF GLORY ALMOST ROUND HER HEAD AS SHE POURED FORTH HER VOICE SHE TOUCHED THE MOUSOMETOR AND GAVE US THE OLD HUNDREDTH PSALM
THERE IS NOBODY TO INTERFERE WITH EVA BUT HE MIGHT GO OFF MR NEVERBEND WHISPERED GRUNDLE
SO SHE AND JACK ARE TO MAKE A MATCH OF IT
BUT SUCH TENDERNESS IS NO BETTER THAN UNPARDONABLE WEAKNESS
IT WAS HERE THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO HOLD THOSE OUTSIDE ASSEMBLIES WHICH TOO OFTEN GUIDED THE RESPONSIBLE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE-HOUSE
ON MOST SUBJECTS HE THOUGHT AS I DID IF HE CAN BE SAID TO HAVE THOUGHT AT ALL
NO ONE WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH AN EFFORT FOR YOU AS I MADE
AND I ENVIED JACK THE SHORT MOMENTS OF TETE-A-TETE RETREAT WHICH SEEMED FROM TIME TO TIME TO BE NECESSARY FOR CARRYING OUT THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE DAY
BUT JACK WHO HAD WALKED UP TO MY CHAIR DURING THE TIME ALLOWED FOR FETCHING DOWN THE NEXT MAN TOLD ME THAT HE HAD GOT HIS EYE AND I COULD SEE A SETTLED LOOK OF FIXED PURPOSE IN HIS FACE
IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR THE ASSEMBLY
THE LAW WAS THERE TO SUPPORT ME AND THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW WAS IN THIS INSTANCE SUPPORTED BY AMPLE EVIDENCE
YES INDEED CONTINUED SIR FERDINANDO IF IT WERE MY TURN NEXT
AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE ALSO THAT THEY WHO HAVE BROUGHT THEMSELVES TO SUICIDE HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE CONTEMPT OF THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES I WOULD NOT TELL HIM OF CATO AND BRUTUS FEELING THAT I COULD NOT STIR HIM TO GRANDEUR OF HEART BY ROMAN INSTANCES
AND A TENDERNESS TO THE OLD LEST THE MAN WHEN UNINSTRUCTED AND UNCONSCIOUS OF GOOD AND EVIL SHOULD BE UNWILLING TO LEAVE THE WORLD FOR WHICH HE IS NOT FITTED
AND IT WAS SPOKEN I WAS AWARE IN A PITEOUS TONE OF VOICE AND WITH MEAGRE BATED BREATH
AND ALLOW ME TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR DEPARTURE CAN NEITHER BE PREVENTED NOR DELAYED BY UNCIVIL WORDS SPOKEN TO THE FUTURE GOVERNOR OF THIS PROSPEROUS COLONY MY WORDS ARE AT ANY RATE LESS UNCIVIL THAN CAPTAIN BATTLEAX'S MARINES
GOVERNMENT THAT HE SHALL BE TREATED WITH ALL RESPECT AND THAT THOSE HONOURS SHALL BE PAID TO HIM WHICH ARE DUE TO THE PRESIDENT OF A FRIENDLY REPUBLIC
I OWN I WAS ANXIOUS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR PREJUDICES STRENGTHENED BY WHAT THEY MIGHT HEAR AT GLADSTONOPOLIS
NO GRAYBODY
I WILL LEAVE YOU TILL THEN AS YOU MAY WISH TO EMPLOY YOURSELF I WENT UP IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS ON DECK AND LOOKING BACK OVER THE TAFFEREL COULD ONLY JUST SEE THE GLITTERING SPIRES OF GLADSTONOPOLIS IN THE DISTANCE
BUT WITH EVA AND WITH EVA'S FATHER THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT
BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT JACK SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED THAT HE AT ANY RATE MUST OBEY THE LAW
MURDER
IS THERE ONE WHO WILL BELIEVE AT ANY RATE THAT I BELIEVE IN THE FIXED PERIOD I DO SAID THE LIEUTENANT
IF HE WOULD DO SO WHO COULD BE EXPECTED TO ABSTAIN
WE SHALL SEE
FOR MYSELF I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING MY MANY DRAWBACKS I HAVE SO LIVED AS TO ENDEAVOUR TO DO GOOD TO OTHERS RATHER THAN EVIL AND THAT THEREFORE I LOOK TO MY DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD WITH AWE INDEED BUT STILL WITH SATISFACTION
IT IS HIS CONDITION BUT NEED HE REMAIN SO
BUT THERE IT WAS AND I REMEMBERED TO HAVE THOUGHT AS I PASSED ON HOW BLESSED WERE THEY WHO STEAMED BY UNCONSCIOUS OF THAT TERRIBLE ORDEAL OF THE FIXED PERIOD WHICH I WAS BOUND TO ENCOUNTER
WE TALK OF A FATHER'S POWER AND KNOW THAT THE OLD ROMANS COULD PUNISH FILIAL DISOBEDIENCE BY DEATH
BUT THE PEOPLE HARDLY HEARD HIM AND AT MY REQUEST HE AGAIN SAT DOWN
AND THEN IT WOULD BE WELL AS I WAS ABOUT TO PERFORM FOR CRASWELLER SO IMPORTANT A PORTION OF HIS FINAL CEREMONY OUR CLOSE INTIMACY SHOULD BE DRAWN STILL NEARER BY A FAMILY CONNECTION
NOT TILL IT HAD BEEN PROVED AND RE-PROVED TEN TIMES OVER WAS IT UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SUN COULD NOT HAVE STOOD STILL UPON GIDEON
STATISTICS HAVE TOLD US THAT THE SUFFICIENT SUSTENANCE OF AN OLD MAN IS MORE COSTLY THAN THE FEEDING OF A YOUNG ONE,--AS IS ALSO THE CARE NOURISHMENT AND EDUCATION OF THE AS YET UNPROFITABLE CHILD
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO DECLARE THAT HE SPUN OUT THE WORDS FROM THE REEL OF HIS MEMORY AS THOUGH THEY ALL CAME SPONTANEOUS AND PAT TO HIS TONGUE
BUT I WISH TO SAY TO YOU BEFORE YOU GO HOW UNHAPPY IT MAKES ME TO THINK THAT I HAVE OPPOSED YOU ALL RIGHT JACK
TO OBLITERATE THAT FEAR FROM THE HUMAN HEART AND TO BUILD UP A PERFECT MANHOOD THAT SHOULD BE LIBERATED FROM SO VILE A THRALDOM HAD BEEN ONE OF THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF MY SCHEME
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES HAD COMBINED TO MAKE IT PRACTICABLE IN BRITANNULA BUT ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT NEVER BE COMBINED AGAIN
WAS THERE EVER A POSITION IN LIFE SO MELANCHOLY SO MOURNFUL SO UNUTTERABLY MISERABLE I REMAINED THERE OPPOSITE GAZING INTO VACANCY BUT I COULD SAY NOTHING
END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
AN ABSOLUTE UNDOUBTED DEMONSTRABLE LIE
HERE AGAIN I OBSERVED A SMALL CLOUD OF SMOKE WHICH HAD GROWN OUT OF THE SPOT I HAD BEFORE SEEN AND I WAS AWARE THAT SOME LARGE SHIP WAS MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE HARBOUR OF GLADSTONOPOLIS
IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT HE SHOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO MAKE AN ENFORCED VISIT TO ENGLAND WITHOUT SOME OPPOSITION
TEN
I WENT ON WITH A FORCED SMILE UPON MY FACE SPEAKING OCCASIONALLY TO THIS OR THE OTHER NEIGHBOUR AS WE MET THEM
LET HIM MAKE WHAT ORATIONS HE MIGHT AGAINST THE FIXED PERIOD ALL GLADSTONOPOLIS WOULD FOLLOW HIM IF HE WON THIS GAME OF CRICKET FOR THEM
PAPA IS TO BE DESTROYED NOT BECAUSE THE LAW WISHES IT BUT TO SUIT THE TASTE OF MR NEVERBEND OH EVA IT IS TRUE TO SUIT MY TASTE WELL--WHAT ELSE
WHILE YOU HAVE MADE LAWS FOR YOURSELVES ANY LAWS SO MADE MUST HAVE ALL THE FORCE OF LAW THAT'S NOT SO CERTAIN SAID A VOICE FROM A DISTANCE WHICH I SHREWDLY SUSPECT TO HAVE BEEN THAT OF MY HOPEFUL SON JACK NEVERBEND
AND HOW WAS I TO UPHOLD THAT IN MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
E-TEXT PREPARED BY JOSEPH E
TAKE THE AVERAGE OF MANKIND ALL ROUND AND THERE WOULD BE BUT THE LESSENING OF A YEAR OR TWO FROM THE LIFE OF THEM ALL
BUT HE SEEMED TO ME TO BE SOMEWHAT HEAVY
I BECAME MORE AND MORE ATTACHED TO HER THE MORE LOUDLY SHE SPOKE ON BEHALF OF HER FATHER
I SUPPOSE YOU'LL TRY IT ON BY FORCE IF NECESSARY
THE FIXED PERIOD IS THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I AM CALLED UPON TO SAY TO YOU A FEW WORDS;--THE FIXED PERIOD AND THE MAN WHO HAS I BELIEVE BEEN AMONG YOU THE CHIEF AUTHOR OF THAT SYSTEM OF LIVING,--AND IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO SAY SO OF DYING ALSO HERE THE ORATOR ALLOWED HIS VOICE TO FADE AWAY IN A MELANCHOLY CADENCE WHILE HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS ME AND WITH A GENTLE MOTION LAID HIS RIGHT HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
HE WAS CONSPICUOUS FOR HIS CRICKETING FINERY AND WHEN GOT UP TO TAKE HIS PLACE AT THE WICKET LOOKED LIKE A DIVER WITH HIS DIVING-ARMOUR ALL ON
WHEN THEY CAME TO SPEAK OF THE VICES AND THE VIRTUES OF PRESIDENT NEVERBEND,--TO TELL OF HIS WEAKNESS AND HIS STRENGTH,--IT SHOULD NEVER BE SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD BEEN DETERRED BY FEAR OF THE PEOPLE FROM CARRYING OUT THE GREAT MEASURE WHICH HE HAD PROJECTED SOLELY FOR THEIR BENEFIT
AND IT DID NOT SUIT ME TO ALLOW THEM TO THINK THAT I WAS AFRAID TO TALK OF THE FIXED PERIOD
I WISH YOU ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THAT WE PARTED AS FRIENDS
NOR I MUCH FOR HIM IF YOU COME TO THAT BUT YOU ARE CONTRACTED IF YOU THINK THAT I AM GOING TO MARRY A MAN BECAUSE OUR NAMES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN IN A BOOK TOGETHER YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
INDEED THE WHOLE OF THIS SIDE OF THE HILL WOULD BECOME AN INSTANTANEOUS RUIN WITHOUT THE SIGN OF A HUMAN BEING ANYWHERE THERE WAS A THREAT IN THIS WHICH I COULD NOT ENDURE
I HAD INTENDED TO HAVE GONE OUT TO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AND SHOULD STILL DO SO TO BID FAREWELL TO HER FATHER
BUT IT WOULD NOT MORE THAN SUFFICE
BUT SOME OF OUR MORE RESPECTABLE LAWYERS INTERFERED AND PERSUADED HIM NOT TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
I HAD KNOWN THAT FOR THE LAST MONTH JACK'S MOTHER HAD BEEN INSTANT WITH HIM TO INDUCE HIM TO SPEAK OUT TO EVA
BUT THE WISDOM OF THE ASSEMBLY HAS SETTLED ALL THAT
MANKIND WOULD GET USED TO IT THE FIRST MAN WILL NEVER GET USED TO IT
AND IN SPITE OF ALL INTERNAL OPPOSITION THE COLLEGE OF THE FIXED PERIOD WAS ALREADY COMPLETED
THE LAW AT ANY RATE WAS WITH ME AND I DID NOT THINK AS YET THAT CRASWELLER WOULD LEND HIMSELF TO THOSE WHO SPOKE OF INVITING THE INTERFERENCE OF ENGLAND
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE THE SUBJECT HERE
OLD BARNES WILL BE HERE BY THAT TIME WON'T HE SIR BARNES IS THE SECOND AND HE WILL COME JUST THREE MONTHS BEFORE CRASWELLER'S DEPARTURE
BUT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE STRONG FAITH WHICH WE OF BRITANNULA HAD IN THAT DOCTRINE WHICH INDUCED OUR SEPARATION
LET HIM DESPISE HAPPINESS AND DO HIS DUTY AND HE WILL IN ONE SENSE BE HAPPY
IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER A BRIGHTER MORE PROSPEROUS AND SPECIALLY A MORE ORDERLY COLONY THAN BRITANNULA WAS EVER SETTLED BY BRITISH COLONISTS
THEY SAY THAT EACH SHOT COSTS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND THAT THE WEAR AND TEAR TO THE VESSEL IS TWO THOUSAND MORE
AND IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FRIGHTEN JACK YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
THEN MY ANGER WENT AND I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD NO REASON TO EXPECT HEROISM FROM CRASWELLER SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN MY FRIEND
WHEN THE COLONY HAD BECOME USED TO THE FIXED PERIOD SYSTEM THE OLD WOULD BECOME ACCUSTOMED AS WELL AS THE YOUNG
THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON-EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
BUT I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE EVA HERE IN MY OWN HOUSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
YOU'LL FIND SAID BOBBS THAT YOUNG MEN IN OUR AIR DO NOT NEED THE RESTRAINTS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO YOU ENGLISH
ONLY FANCY WHERE WE SHOULD ALL BE IF FLUKE SHOWED ITSELF IN BRITANNULA
AND THEY DO GIVE THE PLACE JUST AN APPEARANCE LIKE THE CEMETERY AT OLD CHRISTCHURCH HE MEANT THE CAPITAL IN THE PROVINCE OF CANTERBURY
NEITHER HOWEVER WERE PACKED UP TILL THE DAY BEFORE THEY STARTED
NOR INDEED HAD I QUITE KNOWN HIM UP TO THIS TIME
AND I MUST CONFESS THAT THERE WAS ABSENT ALL THAT TONE OF DOMINEERING ASCENDANCY WHICH HAD MARKED HIS SPEECH AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD
BUT FATHER SAID HE OF COURSE I CAN'T STIR A STEP TILL AFTER THE GREAT CRICKET-MATCH YOU MUST GIVE UP CRICKET FOR THIS TIME
AND HE DID PLAY WELL DID HE NOT
BUT HIS WEAKNESS WAS ONLY A PROOF THAT I MYSELF HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
AS TO THE GHASTLINESS OF THINGS TO BE SEEN THEY COULD NO DOUBT BE REMOVED OUT OF SIGHT
FOR THOUGH EACH PARTY HAD SPARE PLAYERS THEY COULD NOT AGREE AS TO THE USE OF THEM
AND HE IS NOT A MAN FEARFUL OF DEATH IN THE ORDINARY WAY
SIR KENNINGTON SAID LORD MARYLEBONE
I NOW INSPECTED THE BUILDINGS IN A SAD FRAME OF MIND ASKING MYSELF WHETHER IT WOULD EVER COME TO PASS THAT THEY SHOULD BE INHABITED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE
I MANAGED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION BUT I WAS AWARE THAT I DID IT VERY LAMELY
AS FOR YOUR DISINHERITING HIM AND SPENDING ALL YOUR MONEY ON MACHINERY TO ROAST PIGS,--I SAY YOU CAN'T DO IT
OH I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN POSTPONED HOW CAN IT BE POSTPONED
I SUPPOSE SO REPEATED I
I LIKE SIR KENNINGTON BUT EVA NEVER CARED A BUTTON FOR HIM
THEN HE MAY ENJOY THE LAWNS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH IN PEACE,--UNLESS PERCHANCE AN IDEA SHOULD DISTURB HIM THAT HE HAS BEEN PUT INTO THEIR IMMEDIATE POSSESSION BY HIS FATHER'S ACT THEN HE GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT FROM THE VERANDAH BACK INTO THE HOUSE
THERE WAS THE COLLEGE NOW A GRACEFUL BUILDING SURROUNDED BY GROWING SHRUBS AND BROAD PLEASANT WALKS FOR THE OLD MEN ENDOWED WITH A KITCHEN IN WHICH THEIR TASTE SHOULD BE CONSULTED AND WITH A CHAPEL FOR SUCH OF THOSE WHO WOULD REQUIRE TO PRAY IN PUBLIC
HE WAS ELECTED TO THE PRESENT UPPER CHAMBER AS A STRONG ANTI-CHURCH LIBERAL BUT HE NEVER HAS HAD THE SPIRIT TO BE A TRUE REFORMER
WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL START WE HAVE ALREADY LIGHTED OUR FIRES AND OUR SAILORS ARE WEIGHING THE ANCHORS
MORE PARAPHERNALIA WERE REQUIRED TO ENABLE THESE THIRTY-TWO LADS TO PLAY THEIR GAME WITH PROPRIETY THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR THE DEPOSITING OF HALF GLADSTONOPOLIS
EVERYBODY IS TO BE ALLOWED TO DO EXACTLY WHAT HE PLEASES AND NOBODY IS TO BE INTERFERED WITH UNLESS HE INTERFERES WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
WHEN I HAD BEEN LOOKING HARD AT THEM FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THE MEN WERE APPARENTLY BECOMING TIRED OF THEIR CONTINUAL HOP AND WHEN JACK HAD STOOPED AND KNEELED AND SPRAWLED WITH ONE EYE SHUT IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE ATTITUDE ON A SUDDEN THERE CAME A SHARP SNAP A LITTLE SMOKE AND LO SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WAS--OUT
LEAD ME INTO THE COLLEGE AND THERE LET ME PREPARE MYSELF FOR THAT BRIGHTER LIFE WHICH WILL REQUIRE NO MORTAL STRENGTH MY WORDS DID AVAIL WITH MANY AND THEN THEY DEMANDED THAT SEVENTY SHOULD BE THE FIXED PERIOD
BUT MY BROTHER BRITANNULISTS DID NOT AGREE WITH ME THAT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMING RACES IT WAS OUR DUTY RATHER TO DIE AT OUR POSTS THAN YIELD TO THE MENACES OF THE DUKE OF HATFIELD
THESE WERE THE SOLITUDE IN WHICH SHOULD BE PASSED THE ONE LAST YEAR
SHE HAD TAKEN TO ME BECAUSE I HAD SHOWN MYSELF AN ANTI-FIXED-PERIOD MAN
OR IF IT DON'T SHE'LL BE TALKED ABOUT AS HER WHO WAS TO BE
NOT ONLY HAD THE PERIOD BEEN FIXED BUT MONEY HAD BEEN VOTED FOR THE COLLEGE
THE FEELING WAS NOT PLEASANT SEEING THAT I WAS BOUND BY THE STRONGEST OATH WHICH THE MIND CAN CONCEIVE NOT TO SHOW HIM MERCY
WITH THE NORTH-NORTH-WEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT AND HIS 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER IN THE HARBOUR
AND I WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS ALLOWED HALF A PINT OF BITTER BEER BY DR MACNUFFERY
WE HAD A WONDERFUL CRICKET CLUB IN GLADSTONOPOLIS AND BRITANNULA HAD CHALLENGED THE ENGLISH CRICKETERS TO COME AND PLAY ON THE LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH GROUND WHICH THEY DECLARED TO BE THE ONLY CRICKET GROUND AS YET PREPARED ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH WHICH HAD ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS POSSIBLE FOR THE DUE PROSECUTION OF THE GAME
ON BOARD I FOUND SIR FERDINANDO AND ALL THE SHIP'S OFFICERS WITH HIM IN FULL DRESS
AFTER ALL I HAD KNOWN FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THE FEAR OF DEATH WAS A HUMAN WEAKNESS
BUT HE WILL HOPE TO SEE YOU ON ANOTHER OCCASION SOON I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN HOW MANY LONG DAYS I SHOULD HAVE TO PASS WITH CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND HIS OFFICERS OR HOW PLEASANT COMPANIONS I SHOULD FIND THEM WHEN THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE PRESENT INDIGNITY HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT SOFTENED BY TIME
HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW THE EXTENT OF MY POPULARITY NOR HAD HE GAUGED THE DISLIKE WHICH HE HIMSELF WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOUNTER
WHY NOT
BUT I VENTURE TO USE THE EXPERIENCE WHICH I HAVE GATHERED IN MANY COUNTRIES AND TO TELL HIM THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOD'S PURPOSES THE WORLD IS NOT AS YET RIPE FOR HIS WISDOM I COULD NOT HELP THINKING AS HE SPOKE THUS THAT HE WAS NOT PERHAPS ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE ARGUMENTS ON WHICH MY SYSTEM OF THE FIXED PERIOD WAS FOUNDED
OF COURSE JACK IS NOTHING TO ME SHE CONTINUED WITH THAT HALF SOB WHICH HAD BECOME HABITUAL TO HER WHENEVER SHE WAS FORCED TO SPEAK OF HER FATHER'S DEPOSITION
I HAVE NOW GIVEN THE NECESSARY PRELUDE TO THE STORY WHICH I HAVE TO TELL
IT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY THE INGENUITY OF MEN ABLE TO DOMINATE MATTER THOUGH ALTOGETHER POWERLESS OVER MIND
THE VALLEYS WERE FILLED WITH HIS CATTLE
BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE OR I MUST YIELD AND FOR EVER
I WENT BACK TO THE OTHER ROOM WITH LORD MARYLEBONE
THE JOHN BRIGHT IX
PUBLIC OPINION WOULD HAVE FORBIDDEN US TO DEPOSIT CRASWELLER WITHOUT SOME SUCH FURTHER AUTHORITY
POOR SIR LORDS WAS RUN DOWN BY OUR JACK,--COLLIDED AS JACK CALLED IT
YOU WILL THEREFORE INSURE IT
AS FOR EVA SHE WAS SIMPLY INTENT ON PRESERVING THE LEES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE AND HAD BEEN HEARD TO EXPRESS AN OPINION THAT THE COLLEGE WAS ALL HUMBUG AND THAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO LIVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASED GOD TO LET THEM
THIS I WAS TOLD HE DID IN ORDER THAT SOMETHING OF THE ECLAT OF HIS ORATION MIGHT BE TAKEN BACK TO ENGLAND
ALL HIS CHANCE OF MARRYING EVA IS GONE SAID I TO MY WIFE
I AM READY TO GO WITH YOU AND HE ROSE UP FROM HIS SEAT AS THOUGH INTENDING TO WALK AWAY AND BE DEPOSITED AT ONCE
A 250-TON STEAM-SWIVELLER COULD NO DOUBT CRUSH US AND BRING OUR FIXED PERIOD COLLEGE IN PREMATURE RUIN ABOUT OUR EARS
YOU OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH SOME WEAK CROTCHETY POOR OLD CRIPPLE WHO WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER OUT OF THE WAY
AS IF YOU HAD NOT MEN ENOUGH ABOUT THE PLACE TO SEE TO FEEDING YOUR STOCK WITHOUT TROUBLING YOURSELF
AND YET NO ORDINARY FAREWELL HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN US
I COULD EASILY LET THE LAW DIE AWAY BUT IT WAS NOT IN MY POWER TO DECIDE THAT IT SHOULD FALL INTO PARTIAL ABEYANCE
AND THOUGH THE CHANGE BE AWFUL IT SHOULD NOT THEREFORE BY THE SANE JUDGMENT BE TAKEN AS A CHANGE NECESSARILY FOR THE WORST
BUT I OBSERVED AS I WAS DRIVEN DOWN THE STREET LYING OUT AT SEA MANY MILES TO THE LEFT A SMALL SPOT OF SMOKE ON THE HORIZON AS THOUGH IT MIGHT BE OF SOME PASSING VESSEL
JACK HAD IN TRUTH BEEN ATTEMPTING TO PASS SIR KENNINGTON ON THE BICYCLE TRACK WHEN HE HAD UPSET POOR SIR LORDS LONGSTOP
IT OCCURRED TO ME THEN AS I SAT MEDITATING OVER THE TIDINGS CONVEYED TO ME BY ABRAHAM GRUNDLE THAT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT I SHOULD SEE CRASWELLER AND TALK TO HIM FREELY ON THE SUBJECT
NOW IF HIS NATURAL HEIR BE THEN YOUR WIFE IT WILL BE JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH THE PROPERTY WERE YOURS YOUNG GRUNDLE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AFTER DINNER WITH THE CAPTAIN A CUP OF COFFEE WAS ALWAYS BROUGHT IN ON A SILVER TRAY IN A SILVER COFFEE-POT
I HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD A SPECIMEN OF THAT SPECIAL ORATORY TO WHICH THE EPITHET FLOWERY MAY BE MOST APPROPRIATELY APPLIED
IT WAS YOUNG ABRAHAM BY WHOM EVA WAS KISSED BEHIND THE DOOR THAT SUNDAY WHEN WE ATE THE ROLY-POLY PUDDING
AND I WAS QUITE PLEASED TO HEAR LORD MARYLEBONE DECLARE TO HIS MOTHER THAT HE WAS A WONDERFULLY NICE BOY I THINK THE ENGLISH DID TRY TO TURN IT OFF A LITTLE AS THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY COME OUT THERE JUST FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE VOYAGE
BUT THE BIG GUN WAS ONLY FIRED WHEN A BALL WAS HURLED FROM THE MACHINE DIRECTLY INTO THE WICKET
AS I RETURNED IN MY CAB TO THE CITY I COULD SEE THE ENGLISH COLOURS FLUTTERING FROM HER TOPMAST AND THE FLAG OF THE ENGLISH CRICKET-CLUB WAVING FROM HER STERN
LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WOULD DO JUST AS WELL FOR HIM AS FOR GRUNDLE
SIR FERDINANDO IS PROBABLY NOT AWARE TO WHAT IDEAS THAT BOSOM MAY SOME DAY GIVE A SHELTER
YOU WILL COME AND SEE ME ON BOARD JACK WHEN I START THEY WON'T TAKE ME OFF WILL THEY I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN ENGLAND AND LEAVE EVA
BUT SIR FERDINANDO IS EVIDENTLY NOT AWARE THAT THE GENERAL PROLONGATION OF LIFE ON AN AVERAGE IS ONE OF THE EFFECTS TO BE GAINED AND THAT THOUGH HE HIMSELF MIGHT NOT THEREFORE LIVE THE LONGER IF DOOMED TO REMAIN HERE IN BRITANNULA YET WOULD HIS DESCENDANTS DO SO AND WOULD LIVE A LIFE MORE HEALTHY MORE USEFUL AND MORE SUFFICIENT FOR HUMAN PURPOSES
SIR FERDINANDO WITH HIS ELOQUENCE WILL NOT BE THERE AND THE OFFICERS ARE ALL OF THEM GOOD FELLOWS
INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
A GODLIKE HEROISM WOULD HAVE BEEN DEMANDED,--A HEROISM WHICH MUST HAVE SUBMITTED TO HAVE BEEN CALLED BRUTAL,--AND OF SUCH I KNEW MYSELF NOT TO BE THE OWNER
I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU SO AS YOUR WIFE
AND THE WORLD AT LARGE IF IT HEARS OF ME AT ALL WILL SIMPLY HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF MY CRUELTY AND MALIGNITY
WE HAD NOW MADE A FIRST ATTEMPT AT PROGRESS BEYOND THESE LIMITS AND WE WERE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED BY THE FATUOUS DARKNESS OF THE OLD MEN WHOM HAD GREAT BRITAIN KNOWN HER OWN INTEREST SHE WOULD ALREADY HAVE SILENCED BY A FIXED PERIOD LAW ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
BUT YET IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD COMMAND OBEDIENCE AND IF POSSIBLE FRIGHTEN HIM INTO SUBSERVIENCE
I MUST CONFESS THAT IN THESE LAST MOMENTS OF MY SOJOURN AMONG THE PEOPLE OVER WHOM I HAD RULED I WAS TREATED WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED COURTESY
HIS NAME USED FORMERLY TO BE VERY READY IN ALL MY CONVERSATIONS WITH GRAYBODY BUT OF LATE I HAD TALKED TO HIM IN A MORE GENERAL TONE
SOME THERE WERE WHO WOULD NOT SUBMIT ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR CHILDREN
I HAD FELT IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY SO TO MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CEREMONY AS TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS UNLIKE AN EXECUTION AS POSSIBLE
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE SHOWS A HIGH SPIRIT AND GREAT DEVOTION TO THE GIRL IT WAS NOT QUITE ALTOGETHER FOR EVA EITHER WHAT THEN I DEMANDED
I AM NOT GOING TO BE SHUT UP A WHOLE YEAR BEFORE MY TIME WITH THAT HE STALKED INTO THE INNER HOUSE LEAVING ME ALONE ON THE VERANDAH
SO GOOD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR VISITING THE NEW ZEALAND MOUNTAINS MAY NEVER COME AGAIN GIVE UP THE MATCH HE EXCLAIMED
AND HE THE FIRST THE VERY FIRST ON OUR LIST
TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAD THE CHILDISH AMUSEMENTS OF YOUTH BEEN CARRIED AS TO GIVE TO THEM ALL THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE
EVA CRASWELLER HAS PROMISED TO BE MY WIFE INDEED IF YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US YOUR PERMISSION I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THAT SHE HAS TO ASK HER FATHER AND HE'S ALL RIGHT
THE TENACITY OF PURPOSE WHICH DISTINGUISHES OUR FRIEND HERE IS KNOWN TO US ALL
TO SPEAK THE TRUTH CAPTAIN BATTLEAX I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU EXCEL US MORE IN COURAGE THAN YOU DO IN THOUGHT AND PRACTICAL WISDOM
GRUNDLE WANTS TO GET RID OF ME HE REPEATED IN THE SAME TONE
IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO SAY THAT I WOULD SPARE MY OWN FRIEND AND EXECUTE THE LAW AGAINST BARNES AND TALLOWAX
YOU ARE TO SET YOURSELF UP AGAINST GALILEO AND COLUMBUS HE SUGGESTED QUOTING MY WORDS WITH GREAT CRUELTY
THE CAPTAIN HAS THE EXPLODING WIRE UNDER DOUBLE LOCK AND KEY IN HIS OWN STATE-ROOM
IT WAS NOT FOR SOME MONTHS AFTER THAT THAT SHE ALLOWED JACK'S NAME TO BE MENTIONED WITH HER OWN
HE AS ONE UNIT IS STRONG AGAINST A MILLION
AND YOU HAVE PERSUADED HIM BECAUSE HE IS YOUR FRIEND
OH MR NEVERBEND THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT AND I'M AFRAID THAT THEN YOU'LL BE VEXED MY DEAR IF THE LAW BE OH YES THE LAW IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL THING
AND EVA WHO SAW THE ACCIDENT WAS CARRIED FAINTING INTO THE HOUSE
IT WASN'T THAT I LIKED OPPOSING YOU
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOWED A GREAT DIVERGENCE FROM THOSE USUAL COLONIAL BANQUETS AT WHICH THE ELDERS ARE ONLY INVITED TO MEET DISTINGUISHED GUESTS
THERE WAS A CONTINUAL BANGING OF THE KETTLE-DRUM WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE HIM RENEWED SPIRITS
WOULD IT NOT BE WELL THAT I SHOULD THROW MYSELF INTO THE OCEAN AND HAVE DONE WITH A WORLD SO UNGRATEFUL
IF A MAN BE WEAK AT THAT AGE HE THINKS THAT WITH ADVANCING YEARS HE WILL RESUME THE STRENGTH OF HIS YOUTH
JACK DECLARED IN MY HEARING THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT A SHILLING ON
WE'LL JUST STAY AND SEE;--WE'LL JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES SAID ANOTHER ELDER
LORD MARYLEBONE AND HIS FRIEND HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM EIGHT PROFESSIONAL SLAVES AS OUR YOUNG MEN CAME TO CALL THEM,--MOST UNGRACIOUSLY
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT I TOLD HER THAT ALL THAT HAD BEEN SETTLED WHILE JACK WAS STILL AT THE DIDASCALION
AND THIS HE SAID OPENING ANOTHER DOOR IS WHERE WE REALLY SIT AND SMOKE OUR PIPES AND DRINK OUR BRANDY-AND-WATER
BUT EVEN THAT WOULD BE CURED BY CUSTOM
THOUGH I TRUST THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MEET DEATH LIKE A BRAVE MAN WHEN IT MAY COME STILL I SHOULD WISH THAT IT MIGHT COME BY GOD'S HAND AND NOT BY THE WISDOM OF A MAN
IN ALL THAT ASSEMBLY BY WHICH THE LAW HAD BEEN PASSED CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF YOUNG MEN WAS THERE ONE ON WHOM I COULD REST WITH CONFIDENCE TO CARRY OUT THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW WHEN HIS OWN TIME SHOULD COME
I HAD HAD NO TIME TO PREPARE MY WORDS THOUGH THE THOUGHTS HAD RUSHED QUICKLY,--TOO QUICKLY,--INTO MY MIND
THE POWER OF HIS ARM IS ALREADY THE SUBJECT DISCUSSED AT ALL CLUBS AND DRAWING-ROOMS AT HOME
HOW COULD I TALK TO A MAN WHO WOULD SO FAR DESCEND FROM THE DIGNITY OF MANHOOD
YOU KNOW WHO HE IS THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND I'M INFORMED HE'S A TERRIBLE SWELL
A JUDGE SHALL BE DEAF ON THE BENCH WHEN YOUNGER MEN BELOW HIM CAN HEAR WITH ACCURACY
THE PEOPLE DON'T INTEND TO ALLOW YOU TO DEPOSIT MR CRASWELLER CONSIDERING YOUR AGE AND EXPERIENCE JACK DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE TAKING TOO MUCH UPON YOURSELF TO SAY WHETHER PEOPLE WILL ALLOW OR WILL NOT ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE OF THE COUNTRY TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY IF JACK ISN'T OLD SAID MRS NEVERBEND I AT ANY RATE AM OLDER AND I SAY THE SAME THING OF COURSE I ONLY SAID WHAT I THOUGHT CONTINUED JACK
HAVING BROUGHT THE MATTER TO SUCH A PITCH WAS I TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING TO THE PRAYERS OF A GIRL
HOW FALSE WAS HIS IDEA OF MY POWER
NOW SIR FERDINANDO SAID THE CAPTAIN I AM AFRAID THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT MUST LEAVE YOU TO THE KINDNESS OF THE BRITANNULISTS I COULD NOT BE LEFT IN MORE GENEROUS HANDS SAID SIR FERDINANDO NOR IN THOSE OF WARMER FRIENDS
THERE WAS I THINK A LITTLE PRETENCE IN THIS AS THOUGH DR BOBBS HAD BEEN A LONG-ESTABLISHED OFFICER OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS CRICKET CLUB THEY HAD NOT IN TRUTH THOUGHT OF IT AND BOBBS WAS ONLY APPOINTED THE NIGHT AFTER MACNUFFERY'S POSITION AND DUTIES HAD BEEN MADE KNOWN
THE DOUBLE LONG-OFF WAS AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT HE BEING A SMALL MAN I COULD ONLY JUST SEE HIM THROUGH THE FIELD-GLASS WHICH I KEPT IN MY WAISTCOAT-POCKET
VII
IN THE MEANTIME MINERVA WENT TO HIS TENT AND HID HIMSELF AMONG SYMPATHETIC FRIENDS
BUT HE AT ANY RATE HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT I WAS NOT A BLOODY-MINDED CANNIBAL BUT ONE ACTUATED BY A TRUE FEELING OF PHILANTHROPY
I BELIEVE THAT THEY THINK THAT WE MEAN TO EAT THEM I SAID ONE DAY TO CROSSTREES
AND SHE DOES NOT IN TRUTH MEAN A TENTH OF WHAT SHE SAYS
AND EVEN SIR FERDINANDO COMING UPON US WITH ALL HIS EXPERIENCE CAN HARDLY BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN HOW WE MAY BE MADE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS
BUT IT IS TOO LATE NOW I SUPPOSE TO TALK OF THAT
JACK AT ANY RATE IS HAPPY SAID I AND EVA
WE ARE HOWEVER PAINFULLY AWARE THAT THEY DO PREVAIL WHEREVER THE CONCRETE POWER OF GREAT BRITAIN IS FOUND TO BE IN FULL FORCE
JACK WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE AND HIT THE FIRST BALL WITH SUCH ENERGY THAT HE DROVE IT INTO THE OTHER STUMPS AND SMASHED THEM TO PIECES
SUCH OLD AGE SHOULD NOT WE BRITANNULISTS MAINTAIN BE ALLOWED TO BE
AND CONSIDERING THAT IT IS ONLY A SHIP I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT FAIRLY COMFORTABLE ANYTHING MORE LUXURIOUS THAN THE PLACE ASSIGNED TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED ON BOARD SHIP
IT WAS A DREADFUL WORD BUT I WAS ASSURED THAT HE HAD USED IT
WHEN I LOOK BACK AT THE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS TO BE THE LAST NOT OF MY ABSOLUTE LIFE BUT OF MY TRUE EXISTENCE I SHUDDER AS I THINK WHAT I WENT THROUGH
CRASWELLER SAID I TAKING HIM BY THE HAND IT IS A SAD THING THAT YOU AND I SHOULD QUARREL AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PERFECT FRIENDSHIP SO IT IS
WE DID NOT USUALLY USE THE ROOM
HE WAS AT ANY RATE IN A FAR BETTER CONDITION OF MIND FOR PERSUASION THAN THAT IN WHICH I HAD LAST FOUND HIM
I THINK THAT THIS GAVE HIM NEW LIFE
I COULD NOT ENFORCE THE LAW VI ET ARMIS AGAINST CRASWELLER
BUT AS FOR THE RESIDENCES THE LESS WE THINK ABOUT THEM THE BETTER AND SO I DETERMINED TO TROUBLE MY THOUGHTS NO FURTHER WITH THE COLLEGE
I SHOULD HAVE DECLARED THAT IT WOULD NOT COMMENCE BUT WITH THOSE WHO WERE AT PRESENT UNBORN
THE TWO THINGS WENT TOGETHER AS IT WERE
PERISH EVA
AND I SHOULD THINK MUCH OF THE BUTTERFLY WHO SHOULD OWN THAT HE WAS ONLY A BUTTERFLY BECAUSE IT WAS THE AGE OF BUTTERFLIES
NONSENSE SAID MRS NEVERBEND
BUT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO BE DRIVEN TO EXPRESS MY FEAR OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BY ANY GENERAL MEASURE OF THAT KIND
I THOUGHT OF EVA AND HER DESPAIR AND OF HIMSELF WITH ALL THAT NATURAL DESIRE FOR LIFE EAGER AT HIS HEART
AND NOW HE HAD BEEN LIVING THERE HE AND HIS WIFE TOGETHER WITH AN ATTENDANT AND DRAWING HIS SALARY AS CURATOR FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
OH FOR AN ADAMANTINE LAW TO PROTECT THE HUMAN RACE FROM THE IMBECILITY THE WEAKNESS THE DISCONTENT AND THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF OLD AGE
AFTER ALL EVA SIR KENNINGTON HAS NOT QUITE TRAMPLED US UNDER HIS FEET HE SAID
THERE WILL BE A CUP OF TEA IN THE OFFICERS MESS-ROOM AT FIVE O'CLOCK
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS HERE THAT WILL WANT HER EYE ALL THE SAME SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GONE I HAD FELT THAT IT WAS SO BUT YET SHE HAD NEVER PRESSED HER REQUEST
SHE HAD AT ANY RATE TEN YEARS TO RUN AND I NEVER HEARD FROM HER ANY EXPRESSED FEAR OF,--DEPARTURE
FOR MYSELF I WAS DETERMINED THAT THOUGH I WOULD BE GENTLE WITH HIM I WOULD NOT YIELD AN INCH
I AM FORBIDDEN TO PERMIT THIS GENTLEMAN TO PROCEED EITHER ON FOOT OR WITH THE CARRIAGE SAID THE LIEUTENANT
HE IS ONLY A BOY BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT HE COULD THRASH ABRAHAM GRUNDLE AT ONCE
CRASWELLER HAD SAT THERE PERFECTLY SILENT WHILE MR PUDDLEBRANE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS OWN POSSIBLE CREMATION
BUT OF COURSE I'LL COME THEN I GAVE HIM MY BLESSING TOLD HIM WHAT ARRANGEMENTS I HAD MADE FOR HIS INCOME AND WENT DOWN TO MY BREAKFAST WHICH WAS TO BE MY LAST MEAL IN BRITANNULA
HE DINED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK BUT I COULD GIVE MY OWN ORDERS AS TO BREAKFAST AND TIFFIN
CUSTOM WOULD MAKE IT COMPARATIVELY EASY
WHY SHOULD IT DO SO
COME IN
BUT WELL EVA IT IS ALL OVER NOW OH YES AND I AM SO HAPPY
EVA TO ME HAS BEEN ALWAYS DEAR ALMOST AS A DAUGHTER
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JACK NEVER EVEN THINKS OF LOOKING AT EVA THIS WAS A VIEW OF THE CASE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS STRANGE TO ME AND SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT CRASWELLER WAS GRADUALLY BECOMING FIT FOR THE COLLEGE
I RATHER THINK WE MUST MOVE TO-DAY SAID THE CAPTAIN
SINCE I HAVE LIVED ON BOARD HER I HAVE BECOME AWARE THAT THEY WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE ACCOMMODATED AT MY REQUEST A VERY MUCH LARGER FAMILY THAN MY OWN
ON MYSELF I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IT WOULD BE INOPERATIVE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL LOCKING UP SAID I ANGRILY
I MUST NOW EXPLAIN BEFORE I BEGIN MY STORY CERTAIN DETAILS OF OUR PLAN WHICH CREATED MUCH SCHISM AMONG OURSELVES
HE ORDERED HIMSELF TO BE CALLED AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND THE ASSISTANTS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD LISTENED TO HIS WORDS AS THOUGH FEELING THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON THEIR OBEDIENCE
BUT I HAD BEEN LONG ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK OF MY OWN IN WHICH WERE INSCRIBED THE PERIODS OF ALL THOSE WHO HAD COME TO BRITANNULA WITH US
YES MY DEAR IT IS VERY SAD SAD
BUT BY THE ADMITTED TESTIMONY OF ALL PEOPLE,--MY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN AT HOME IN ENGLAND AND THOSE WHO ARE EQUALLY MY FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN IN THE COLONIES TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN SENT,--IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IN PROSPERITY INTELLIGENCE AND CIVILISATION YOU ARE EXCELLED BY NO ENGLISH-SPEAKING SECTION OF THE WORLD
NO ONE THERE WILL WANT ME
THE OFFICERS WERE CHIEFLY YOUNG MEN
BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT THERE WERE TO BE TWO INNINGS FOR EACH SET I POSITIVELY DECLINED
YOU ASK THE QUESTION AND I ANSWER YOU
IT HAD BECOME NECESSARY DURING THIS PERIOD TO BRING FORWARD IN THE ASSEMBLY THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD AS IT WAS FELT THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION IT WOULD NOT BE EXPEDIENT TO CARRY OUT THE ESTABLISHED LAW WITHOUT THE INCREASED SANCTION WHICH WOULD BE GIVEN TO IT BY A FURTHER VOTE IN THE HOUSE
JUSTUM ET TENACEM PROPOSITI VIRUM NOTHING CAN TURN HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE OR INDUCE HIM TO CHANGE HIS INFLEXIBLE WILL
BUT THOUGH THE WORDS WERE DETERMINED THERE WAS A CERTAIN VACILLATION IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE ME
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE THE EXACT WORDS OF THESE TWO SPEECHES AS THEY WERE BOTH TAKEN DOWN BY THE REPORTING TELEPHONE-APPARATUS WHICH ON THE OCCASION WAS FOUND TO WORK WITH GREAT ACCURACY
AND I WITH AN UNFEELING PERTINACITY HAD GIVEN THE CASE AGAINST HIM
AND I LOOKING AT THE MATTER FROM MY OWN POINT OF VIEW WAS A HUSBAND THE HEAD OF A FAMILY A MAN LARGELY CONCERNED IN BUSINESS,--I WAS TO BE CARRIED AWAY IN BONDAGE--I WHO HAD DONE NO WRONG HAD DISOBEYED NO LAW WHO HAD INDEED BEEN CONSPICUOUS FOR MY ADHERENCE TO MY DUTIES
I KNEW THAT IT WAS UTTERLY OUT OF MY POWER TO DO SO
THIS IS WHERE WE FEED
BUT I AM NOT AT ALL SO SURE ABOUT THAT YOUNG FELLOW ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
AND THOUGH THE MANUSCRIPT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENT HOME WHO WOULD SEE IT THROUGH THE PRESS WITH ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS
HAD I DECLARED THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT TO BED WITHOUT HIS SUPPER I SHOULD HAVE EXPRESSED MYSELF BETTER BOTH AS A FATHER AND A MAGISTRATE
AND TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE WE REACHED ENGLAND HE HAD ANOTHER
WELL I DON'T KNOW
AND YET YOUR ASSEMBLY HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO GIVE TO THE SYSTEM ALL THE STABILITY OF LAW
BUT THE TERM WAS RECEIVED WITH SILENCE
IN WHAT LITTLE I MIGHT SAY TO MRS NEVERBEND ON THE SUBJECT I COULD CONTINUE THAT TONE OF SARCASTIC TRIUMPH IN WHICH I HAD REPLIED TO SIR FERDINANDO
WHETHER THIS AROSE ENTIRELY FROM HER DESIRE TO PROMOTE JACK'S WELFARE OR FROM A REFLECTION THAT HER OWN PERIOD OF DEPOSITION WAS GRADUALLY BECOMING NEARER I NEVER COULD QUITE MAKE UP MY MIND
IT IS ABOVE THIRTY YEARS SINCE I COMMENCED MY AGITATION IN BRITANNULA
AND IF HE DID FLY WHAT STEP SHOULD WE TAKE NEXT
NOW AS THIS MATTER WENT ON I BECAME FULL OF WRATH WITH MY SON AND WITH MY WIFE AND WITH POOR OLD CRASWELLER
CAN IT NOT BE BROUGHT ABOUT THAT MEN SHOULD ARRANGE FOR THEIR OWN DEPARTURE SO AS TO FALL INTO NO SENILE WEAKNESS NO SLIPPERED SELFISHNESS NO UGLY WHININGS OF UNDEFINED WANT BEFORE THEY SHALL GO HENCE AND BE NO MORE THOUGHT OF
AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WAS MY PRIDE AND VANITY WHICH HAD MADE ME DO SO I COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO HER THAT THEY WERE NOT THE CAUSE
THOUGH MY VERY HEART WAS BLEEDING I KNOW THAT I DID RIGHT
SIR KENNINGTON BEHAVED ADMIRABLY AND HIMSELF BROUGHT HIM HOME IN HIS CURRICLE
JACK'S TRIUMPH WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE ONLY THAT IT WAS LUDICROUS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BUT THINK AS I DID OF THE VERY LITTLE MATTER AS TO WHICH THE CONTEST HAD BEEN RAISED;--JUST A GAME OF CRICKET WHICH TWO SETS OF BOYS HAD BEEN PLAYING AND WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS NO MORE THAN AN AMUSEMENT,--AS A PASTIME BY WHICH TO REFRESH THEMSELVES BETWEEN THEIR WORK
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I DID FEEL THE STING BITTERLY WHEN HE SPOKE OF MY PUTTING AN END TO HIM
DEAR CRASWELLER I MURMURED TO MYSELF AS I TURNED AGAIN TOWARDS GLADSTONOPOLIS AND HURRYING BACK BURIED MYSELF IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAD HURRIED HIM OFF IN ORDER THAT JACK WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT EVA SAID I WITH INDIGNATION
THERE WAS NO HIGH FEELING AS TO FUTURE GENERATIONS OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES NO GRAND IDEA THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO PERFORM A GREAT DUTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND IN GENERAL BUT SIMPLY THE NOTION THAT AS HE HAD ALWAYS ADVOCATED MY THEORY AS MY FRIEND HE WOULD NOT NOW DEPART FROM IT LET THE COST TO HIMSELF BE WHAT IT MIGHT
BUT I OWN THAT I COULD HAVE WISHED THAT MRS NEVERBEND HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT ON THE OCCASION
CHAPTER X
I TURNED ALL THIS OVER IN MY MIND BECAUSE THE SLOPES OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH ARE VERY ALLURING AND THEY WOULD ALL BELONG TO EVA SO SOON
HE HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO SAY THAT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WORLD AT LARGE THE SYSTEM WAS A BAD SYSTEM
BUT THERE WERE TWO CAUSES WHICH PERSUADED ME THAT I HAD BETTER GO
NO FOLLOWERS WILL COME AFTER THEM HERE BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY'LL SMELL THE DEAD BODIES RUBBISH I EXCLAIMED ANGRILY
I DO LOVE HIM BETTER THAN ANY ONE IN THE WORLD
IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD WISH TO REMAIN AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
IN THIS WAY WE DROVE ON TILL COMING TO A TURN OF THE ROAD THE EXPANSE OF THE SEA APPEARED BEFORE US
AS I RETURNED I CAME ROUND BY THE QUAYS DROPPING MY CAB AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET
IT PLEASES MANY AND CAN OFFEND NONE
I DID KNOW THAT WERE BRITANNULA TO APPEAL ALOUD TO ENGLAND ENGLAND WITH THAT DESIRE FOR INTERFERENCE WHICH HAS ALWAYS CHARACTERISED HER WOULD INTERFERE
BUT UNDER THE STRESS OF MISFORTUNE THEY HAD BOTH BECOME UNNATURALLY OLD AND HAD AT LAST BEEN LEFT RUINED AND HOPELESS WITHOUT A SHILLING ON WHICH TO DEPEND
AND THAT IF HE DID SO OTHERS MIGHT BE MADE TO DO SO TOO
WHAT ORDER
PERHAPS HOWEVER IN THE EYES OF SOME HER BRIGHTEST CHARM LAY IN THE WEALTH WHICH HER FATHER POSSESSED
BUT IT HAD BEEN RUMOURED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO INVENT FALSEHOODS AS TO THEIR AGE AND I WAS AWARE THAT WE MIGHT BE LED ASTRAY BY THEM
THEY WOULD DO SO FOR HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS SON-IN-LAW
AND THOUGH I WAS SURPRISED AT THE ERROR I DID NOT NOTICE IT ON THIS OCCASION
BUT IT WAS TO NO EFFECT
SEVERAL ACCIDENTS HAPPENED BUT THE CRICKETERS TOOK VERY LITTLE ACCOUNT OF THESE
NEITHER OF THEM WAS SURELY EVER TRIED AS I WAS AT THIS MOMENT
I WAS FORCED TO CONFESS AS MUCH
NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW THEIR MASTERS SAID MRS NEVERBEND
THERE WAS CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SEATED THERE BEAUTIFUL WITH A COCKED-HAT AND AN EPAULET AND GOLD BRAID
I AM TAKING A LIBERTY MR NEVERBEND SHE SAID IN TROUBLING YOU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT EVA MY DEAR HOW CAN ANYTHING YOU DO BE CALLED A LIBERTY I DO NOT KNOW MR NEVERBEND
IT IS AN EVIL SIGN OF THE TIMES,--OF THE TIMES THAT ARE IN SO MANY RESPECTS HOPEFUL,--THAT THE GREATEST INVENTIONS OF THE DAY SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE THE SHAPE OF ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION
AND THIS WAS TOLD TO ME IN MY OWN ROOM IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS IN THE VERY SANCTUM OF PUBLIC LIFE BY A STOUT FLORID GENTLEMAN IN A BLACK COAT OF WHOM I HITHERTO KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT THAT HIS NAME WAS BROWN
I HAD NO MORE POWER OVER HIM IN THAT RESPECT THAN ON ANY ONE ELSE
ALL THIS I AM WILLING TO ADMIT IN THE FORM OF A TALE WHICH I HAVE ADOPTED FOR MY PRESENT WORK AND FOR WHICH I MAY HOPE TO OBTAIN SOME POPULARITY IN ENGLAND
I SHOULD HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE TO SAVE YOURSELF FROM AN HONOURABLE--DEPOSITION THE FIXED DAY COMING AT A CERTAIN KNOWN HOUR
THAT LAW WILL BE SPECIALLY WIPED OUT FROM YOUR STATUTE-BOOK
CONTENTS VOLUME I
AND WHO HAD BEEN THE CHIEF ORATOR ON THE OCCASION BUT JACK NEVERBEND
AND THEN THE FIXED PERIOD WOULD BE AT AN END
AND THAT IS ALL I SUPPOSE THAT I NEED SAY UPON THE SUBJECT
FOR THE SAKE OF THE BENEFITS WHICH ARE TO ACCRUE TO UNKNOWN THOUSANDS OF YOUR FELLOW-CREATURES IT IS YOUR DUTY TO OBEY THE LAW THIS I SAID IN A LOW VOICE STILL HOLDING HIM BY THE HAND
AND YET I SOON FOUND THAT THE ONE OPPONENT WHOM I HAD MOST TO FEAR IN BRITANNULA WAS MY OWN SON
AND EXECUTION
IT WAS AS THOUGH THEY WOULD TUMBLE OUT FROM MY OWN MOUTH IN PRECIPITATE ENERGY
AND THEN WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE MOVING I SPOKE TO THEM TWO OR THREE WORDS
THERE WERE HER OWN VOWS AND HER PARENT'S ASSENT AND SOMETHING PERHAPS OF REMAINING LOVE
HE WAS QUIET AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY SILENT DURING THE WHOLE EVENING
I WAS TEARING MY OWN HEART TO PIECES;--BUT I REMEMBERED COLUMBUS AND GALILEO
COULD IT BE THAT CRASWELLER MY OWN CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND--THE MAN TO WHOM I HAD TRUSTED THE VERY SECRETS OF MY SOUL ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER,--COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE UNWILLING TO BE DEPOSITED WHEN THE DAY HAD COME
WE HAD NOT COME TO THAT YET,--THAT A MAN SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY PLAYING CRICKET
HE HIT WILDLY AND FOUR BALLS PASSED HIM WITHOUT TOUCHING HIS WICKET
OH MY FRIENDS IT IS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT A STARTLING PROJECT UNCOMMON IF IT WAS YOUR TURN NEXT SAID TALLOWAX IN THE GALLERY
BUT I COULD NOT BUT SUSPECT AT THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS IN SOME SPECIAL MEASURE CONCERNED IN THE MISSION ON WHICH THE GUNBOAT HAD BEEN SENT
MY FRIEND IN THE GALLERY CONTINUED SIR FERDINANDO REMINDS ME OF THE VERY WORD FOR WHICH I SHOULD IN VAIN HAVE CUDGELLED MY BRAIN
THAT WAS THE LIGHT IN WHICH MR CRASWELLER LOOKED AT IT
BUT HE HAD IN TRUTH GIVEN RISE TO VERY SERIOUS AND SOLEMN THOUGHTS
I HAD NOT BEEN IN ENGLAND SINCE I WAS A LITTLE CHILD AND I COULD NOT BUT FEEL NOW THAT I MIGHT BE DETAINED THERE BY CIRCUMSTANCES OR DIE THERE OR THAT CRASWELLER WHO WAS TEN YEARS MY SENIOR MIGHT BE DEAD BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE COME BACK
WHY SHOULD WE GO FURTHER THAN JESUS CHRIST FOR AN EXAMPLE
CRASWELLER I SAID MY FRIEND MY BROTHER I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW IT WAS THAT MR BRITTLEREED LIVED THROUGH THAT OVER
WHAT MRS NEVERBEND SAYS AT SUCH MOMENTS HAS ALWAYS IN IT A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD SENSE
THE CHIEF STREET OF GLADSTONOPOLIS RUNNING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CITY DESCENDS A HILL TO THE LEVEL OF THE HARBOUR
I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE HIS DAUGHTER EVA AND I MUST SAY A WORD AS TO THE PERSONAL QUALITIES OF HER FATHER
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW ALL THE RULES OF THE GAME AND TO BE RATHER QUICK IN KEEPING THE WICKET
AND I LIKE TO SEE THAT THEY GET THEIR SUPPERS SERVED TO THEM WARM BOTHER THE YOUNG FOALS SAID I
WE MEAN TO TAKE A WRINKLE FROM YOU FELLOWS IN BRITANNULA WHERE EVERYBODY SEEMS UNDER YOUR PRESIDENCY TO BE AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG WE HAVE NO UPPER HOUSE WITH US MY LORD SAID I
IF THERE HAD BEEN NO QUESTION ABOUT THE FIXED PERIOD I DO THINK I COULD HAVE CUT OUT ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
THIS THING WAS TO BE DONE BY THE LAW
YOUNG GRUNDLE HAD SUGGESTED CREMATION HALL BECAUSE SUCH WAS THE ULTIMATE END TO WHICH THE MERE HUSKS AND HULLS OF THE CITIZENS WERE DESTINED
HOWEVER I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MAN IS THINKING OF IT BUT THE YOUNG MAN WAS THINKING OF IT
THEN THERE CAME A STRUGGLE WITH THE ENGLISH AND THE BRITANNULISTS AS TO WHICH WOULD GET THE NEAREST TO FOURTEEN MINUTES
THERE MUST IN FACT BE A FIXED PERIOD
I WAS GOING TO ENGLAND AND MIGHT PROBABLY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
BUT I NOW AT ONCE BEGAN TO RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OCCASION AND TO SEE THAT FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS CRASWELLER THE COLLEGE AND THE FIXED PERIOD MUST BE BANISHED IF NOT FROM MY THOUGHTS AT ANY RATE FROM MY TONGUE
SUCH WAS THE LAW OF BRITANNULA ON THE SUBJECT
OH BUT SIR ENGLAND ISN'T OUR ENEMY NOT WHEN SHE COMES AND INTERRUPTS THE QUIET EXECUTION OF OUR LAWS BY THREATS OF BLOWING US AND OUR CITY AND OUR CITIZENS TO INSTANT DESTRUCTION SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
I AS PRESIDENT OF THE EMPIRE HAD AGREED TO USE THE LANCET IN THE FIRST TWO OR THREE CASES THEREBY INTENDING TO INCREASE THE HONOURS CONFERRED
THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN TOWARDS CARRYING OUT THE TYRANNICAL ILLEGAL AND ALTOGETHER INJURIOUS INTENTION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
THOSE THINGS DO TELL CROSSTREES HAD SAID TO ME WHEN I HAD ATTEMPTED TO BE JOCOSE ABOUT THESE PUNCTILIOS
AND YOU MAY BE SURE OF THIS THAT WHILE THE POWER OF LABOUR REMAINS TO ME I SHALL NEVER DESIST TO WORK FOR THE PURPOSE THAT I HAVE AT HEART
ARRANGEMENTS TO THIS EFFECT HAD BEEN STUDIOUSLY MADE BY MYSELF
HE WAS NO DOUBT A GALLANT OFFICER AND POSSESSED OF ALL NECESSARY GIFTS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF A 250-TON STEAM SWIVEL-GUN
IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HERE AT THIS TIME TO-MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO THIS AGAIN I OBJECTED VIOLENTLY
OUR YOUNG MEN ARE AGAIN BECOMING TORPID BENEATH THE WEIGHT IMPOSED UPON THEM
YOU AND ALL YOUR LAWS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO POOR MR CRASWELLER,--AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT SHAME IF YOU DID
WHEN I WENT HOME AND TOLD THEM WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY WERE OF COURSE SURPRISED BUT APPARENTLY NOT VERY UNHAPPY
THEY COULD NEVER HAVE CAUGHT ME HAD I CHOSEN TO AVOID THEM
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT MY FEELINGS WILL BE WHEN THAT MOMENT SHALL HAVE COME I HAD NOT IN TRUTH THOUGHT OF IT
IT SEEMED TO ME TO TAKE A LONG TIME DURING WHICH THE FOURTEEN MEN AROUND ALL LOOKED AS THOUGH EACH MAN WERE INTENDING TO HOP OFF TO SOME OTHER SPOT THAN THAT ON WHICH HE WAS STANDING
NOW DRINKS THE KING TO HAMLET I COULD NOT BUT FANCY AT THESE GREAT SIGNS OF SUCCESS THAT I WAS HAMLET'S FATHER
BUT I WAS ENABLED TO ACCEPT THESE FRIENDLY NOISES AS HAVING BEEN AWARDED TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF
WILL COME
WHAT ELSE
I WAS GLAD TO SEE HOWEVER THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE SO GLIB WITH HIS TONGUE AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN ADDRESSING THE PEOPLE
AND WHAT MAY BE YOUR BUSINESS WITH ME MR SECOND LIEUTENANT OUR CAPTAIN CAPTAIN BATTLEAX'S COMPLIMENTS AND HE HOPES YOU WON'T OBJECT TO POSTPONE THIS INTERESTING CEREMONY FOR A DAY OR TWO TILL HE MAY COME AND SEE
ONCE OR TWICE I DID ENDEAVOUR TO LEAD HIM ON TO THE SUBJECT
HOW DARE YOU ASK MR NEVERBEND SHE DEMANDED WITH INDIGNATION
WHAT I MEAN IS JACK THAT WHEN SONS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THEIR FATHERS DEPOSITED AT A CERTAIN AGE AND WERE AWARE THAT THEY WERE TREATED WITH EVERY RESPECT THAT KIND OF FEELING WHICH YOU DESCRIBE WOULD WEAR OFF
SIR KENNINGTON DID HIS BEST FLINGING THE BALL WITH HIS MOST TREMENDOUS IMPETUS AND THEN JUST ROLLING IT UP WITH WHAT SEEMED TO ME THE MOST PROVOKING LANGUOR
TO DIE WOULD BE AS NOTHING
I FELT IT TO BE NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD SELECT THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING JACK UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD NOT FEAR HIS OPPOSITION
ENGLAND WITH UNSURPASSED TYRANNY HAD SENT OUT ONE OF HER BRUTAL MODERN INVENTIONS AND THREATENED US ALL WITH BLOOD AND GORE AND MURDER IF WE DID NOT GIVE UP OUR BENEFICENT MODERN THEORY
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT DICK ARDWINKLE WAS LOST THERE A YEAR OR TWO AGO AND CAME TO HIS DEATH IN A MOST FRIGHTFUL MANNER THAT WAS BEFORE I WAS BORN SAID JACK OR AT ANY RATE VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
EVERYTHING HAD THRIVEN WITH CRASWELLER AND EVERYTHING MUST BELONG TO EVA AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LED INTO THE COLLEGE
AND RISING UP I MOTIONED TO THOSE AROUND US TO LET US PASS
NOT MUCH HAD BEEN SEEN OR HEARD OF GRUNDLE DURING THE MATCH AND AS FAR AS EVA WAS CONCERNED HE HAD SUCCUMBED AS SOON AS SIR KENNINGTON OVAL HAD APPEARED UPON THE SCENE
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
A YEAR SINCE I WOULD HAVE REJOICED ON SUCH AN OCCASION AND WOULD HAVE ASSURED MYSELF THAT I WOULD SHOW TO THE STRANGERS THE GRANDEUR OF THIS CEREMONY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN NEW TO THEM
THE MATTER HAS NEVER BEEN EXPLAINED TO THEM IN ENGLAND AND PERHAPS MY WORDS MAY PREVAIL JACK BY SHAKING HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY SEEMED TO INDICATE HIS IDEA THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE THE CASE
I TOO WOULD HAVE A SMALL HERD A LITTLE FLOCK OF MY OWN SURROUNDED BY NO SUCH GLORIES AS THOSE OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH,--OWING NOTHING TO WEALTH OR SCENERY OR NEIGHBOURHOOD,--AND THERE TILL GOD SHOULD TAKE ME I WOULD SPEND THE EVENING OF MY DAY
BUT HOW CAN A LITTLE STATE BUT A FEW YEARS OLD SITUATED ON A SMALL ISLAND FAR REMOVED FROM ALL THE CENTRES OF CIVILISATION CONTEND ON ANY POINT WITH THE OWNER OF THE GREAT 250-TON SWIVELLER-GUN THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MR NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
AND IF SO WILL NOT REASON TEACH HIM TO LIKE TO DO WHAT HE OUGHT
JUST AT THIS TIME JACK WAS TALKING TO HIS MOTHER MORNING NOON AND NIGHT ABOUT EVA AND THREATENING YOUNG GRUNDLE WITH ALL KINDS OF SCHOOLBOY PUNISHMENTS IF HE SHOULD PERSEVERE IN HIS SUIT
WHEN OUR POPULATION SHOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLION PRESUMING THAT ONE ONLY IN FIFTY WOULD HAVE REACHED THE DESIRED AGE THE SUM ACTUALLY SAVED TO THE COLONY WOULD AMOUNT TO L1,000,000 A-YEAR
MY IDEA WAS TO GIVE TO THE MIND SOME NOTION OF AN APPROACH TO GOOD THINGS TO COME AND I PROPOSED TO CALL THE PLACE ADITUS BUT MEN SAID THAT IT WAS UNMEANING AND DECLARED THAT BRITANNULISTS SHOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED TO OWN THE TRUTH
WHETHER IN FUTURE AGES SUCH A PHILOSOPHY MAY PREVAIL WHO SHALL SAY
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO BROUGHT WITH THEM MERINO SHEEP INTO THE COLONY
AND INDEED AS I FOUND NOT TO GO TILL THIS QUESTION OF THE FIXED PERIOD SHOULD BE SETTLED
AND WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE HEARD ME TO-DAY I WILL IN MY TURN HEAR YOU TO-MORROW
THAT SHE WAS THERE I WAS AWARE,--BUT SHE NEVER CAME INTO MY PRESENCE TILL THE EVENING BEFORE THE APPOINTED DAY AS I SHALL PRESENTLY HAVE TO TELL
A REGISTER HAD OF COURSE BEEN COMMENCED AND THERE WERE ALREADY THOSE WHO REFUSED TO STATE THEIR EXACT AGES
YOUR GALILEO HAD A HARD TIME WHEN HE SAID THAT THE SUN STOOD STILL
AS THE VESSEL CAME IN WE BEGAN TO ASCEND THE HILL BUT THE HORSES PROGRESSED VERY SLOWLY
THEN THE PERIOD OF YOUR DEPOSITION WILL HAVE ARRIVED AND IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING,--TWO YEARS HENCE MIND,--THE FIXED PERIOD OF YOUR DEPARTURE WILL HAVE COME NO IS NOT SUCH THE TRUTH NO
I TOO HAVE THE COMPLICATED AFFAIRS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE TO ARRANGE AND MY WIFE AND SON TO LEAVE THOUGH I WOULD NOT FOR A MOMENT BE SUPPOSED TO PUT THESE PRIVATE MATTERS FORWARD WHEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE IS CONCERNED
YOUNG GRUNDLE DEMANDED ONE MORNING WHETHER IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO SEE THAT THE DIFFERENT CLAUSES AS TO THE NEW LAW RESPECTING DEPOSITIONS WERE AT ONCE CARRIED OUT
BUT WAS I SURE THAT OBDURACY DID NOT COME FROM MY ANXIETY TO BE COUNTED WITH COLUMBUS AND GALILEO
HE WAS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS CLOTHES AND I WAS TOLD BY LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES ON THE FIRST DAY THAT HE WOULD RESENT IT AS A BITTER OFFENCE HAD I COME DOWN TO DINNER WITHOUT A WHITE CRAVAT
YOU'D BE RUN OVER AND MADE MINCE-MEAT OF SAID JACK SPEAKING OF SUCH A CATASTROPHE WITH LESS HORROR THAN I THOUGHT IT OUGHT TO HAVE ENGENDERED IN HIS YOUTHFUL MIND
AND I MUST SAY THAT IT IS ONLY RATIONAL THAT JACK SHOULD BE ON THE SAME SIDE
THOUGH YOU SHOULD REDUCE ME TO ATOMS FROM THEM WOULD SPRING THOSE OPINIONS WHICH WOULD SERVE ALTOGETHER TO SILENCE YOUR ARTILLERY
THE FIRST MAN WAS READY TO GO TO THE STAKE AND I HAD FELT ALL ALONG THAT THE GREAT DIFFICULTY WOULD BE IN OBTAINING THE WILLING ASSENT OF THE FIRST MARTYR
BUT HOW BASE MUST BE MY CONDITION WHEN I COULD TAKE DELIGHT IN THINKING THAT IT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
BUT IT HAS TO BE ENCOUNTERED
THE WORDS AS THEY FELL FROM THE MOUTH OF THE SPEAKERS WERE COMPOSED BY MACHINERY AND MY SPEECH APPEARED IN THE LONDON MORNING NEWSPAPERS WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE TIME OF ITS UTTERANCE
THEY WERE STANDING AT THE WATER'S-EDGE WHILE THREE LONG-BOATS WERE BEING PREPARED TO TAKE THEM OFF
XI
GABRIEL CRASWELLER
GABRIEL CRASWELLER
GRUNDLE HAD THOUGHT THAT IF HE COULD ONCE SEE HIS FATHER-IN-LAW DEPOSITED HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO WALK INTO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH AS MASTER
HOW THAT INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED AND WITH WHAT WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF THE BRITANNULISTS I NOW PROCEED TO TELL
THEY TOO HAD BEEN WEAK AND HAD TREMBLED AND HAD ALMOST FEARED
I DID ASSENT
ABRAHAM GRUNDLE WAS ONE OF THE CRICKETERS AND AS SUCH WAS FREQUENTLY ON THE GROUND AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
NOT ONLY WOULD HE NOT OBEY ME BUT HE WOULD BE SUPPORTED IN HIS DISOBEDIENCE BY EVEN THE ELDERS OF THE COMMUNITY
I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION WHETHER IT WOULD BE GOOD OR BAD
I COULD NOT EVEN ROB HIM OF A SINGLE LUXURY WITHOUT AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING MUCH GREATER THAN HE WOULD FEEL
WE HAD FIXED OUR PRICE AT A DECIMAL IN ORDER THAT THE SUM SO RAISED MIGHT BE USED FOR THE ORNAMENTATION OF THE COLLEGE
BUT CERTAIN AIDS MUST BE GIVEN AND THE CREMATING FURNACE MUST BE REMOVED SO AS TO BE SEEN BY NO EYE AND SMELT BY NO NOSE
AND NOW I WAS ASTOUNDED TO HEAR HIM CLAIM ANOTHER YEAR WHICH COULD NOT BE ALLOWED HIM
GRUNDLE'S BACK WAS STILL BAD AND THE POOR FELLOW WITH THE BROKEN LEG COULD ONLY BE WHEELED OUT IN FRONT OF THE VERANDAH TO LOOK AT THE PROCEEDINGS THROUGH ONE OF THOSE WONDERFUL LITTLE GLASSES WHICH ENABLE THE CRITIC TO SEE EVERY MOTION OF THE PLAYERS AT HALF-A-MILE'S DISTANCE
DID ANY ONE WHO ATTEMPTED TO DETER US BY THE USE OF FOUL LANGUAGE BETHINK HIMSELF THAT MURDER TO BE MURDER MUST BE OPPOSED TO THE LAW
ACCORDING TO THIS MAN'S FEELINGS THE WHOLE SYSTEM WAS TO BE MADE TO SUIT ITSELF TO THE PECULIARITIES OF ONE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTION
HE HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH OF THE ENGLISH BARONET AS TO HAVE BEEN COWED AND QUENCHED BY HIS GRANDEUR
I HAVE NONE OF THAT STEEL AND FIBRE WHICH WILL ENABLE A REALLY STRONG MAN TO STAND FIRM BY CONVICTIONS EVEN WHEN OPPOSED BY HIS AFFECTIONS
BUT OUGHT HE NOT TO LIKE TO DO SO
BUT IT WAS BEFORE THE FEELING OF MY FATE HAD COME NEAR TO ME
I HAD SADLY BUT SURELY ACKNOWLEDGED SO MUCH AS THAT TO MYSELF
BUT WHEN THE TIME SHOULD COME THAT NO SUCH OLD MAN HAD SO EXISTED I COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT A FRAME OF MIND WOULD BE CREATED NOT INDISPOSED TO CONTENTMENT
THE STORY GOES THAT IT WENT RIGHT UP TO THE VERANDAH AND THAT EVA PICKED IT UP AND HAS TREASURED IT EVER SINCE
AND TO SAVE POOR OLD MR CRASWELLER'S LIFE FROM THIS MOST INHUMAN LAW
WILL YOU BELIEVE IT?--EVA SWORE A MOST SOLEMN OATH THAT IF HER FATHER WAS PUT INTO THAT COLLEGE SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY A HUMAN BEING
EVA SAT QUIET WITHOUT A SIGN
AND YET THIS MAN,--MY FRIEND AND BROTHER,--HAD SUPPOSED THAT I COULD BE BOUGHT TO CHANGE MY PURPOSE BY THE PRETTY SLOPES AND FAT FLOCKS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
WHETHER IN THIS HE PREFERRED THE LAW TO EVA OR ACTED IN ANGER AGAINST CRASWELLER FOR INTERFERING WITH HIS PROSPECTS OR HAD AN IDEA THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH HIS WHILE TO MARRY THE GIRL WHILE THE GIRL'S FATHER SHOULD BE LEFT ALIVE OR HAD GRADUALLY FALLEN INTO THIS BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT FROM THE OPPOSITION SHOWN TO HIM I COULD NOT QUITE TELL
I'LL PUNCH THAT FELLOW'S HEAD SOME OF THESE DAYS JACK SAID ONE EVENING WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
IT IS FOR THE COUNTRY THE COUNTRY SHE EXCLAIMED RISING UP
I MYSELF AT THE AGE OF THIRTY HAD BEEN ELECTED SPEAKER OF THAT PARLIAMENT
HE REMAINED SPEECHLESS IN THE CARRIAGE
BUT FOR WHOSE GOOD ARE THE OLD AND EFFETE TO BE MAINTAINED AMID ALL THESE TROUBLES AND MISERIES
WISHING TO ENCOURAGE HIM I WENT ON
IT WOULD BE A PRIDE FOR THE YOUNG MAN TO FEEL THAT HIS PARENT'S NAME HAD BEEN ENROLLED TO ALL COMING TIME IN THE BRIGHT BOOKS OF THE COLLEGE WHICH WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR THE FIXED PERIOD
THIRTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE AND MY PERIOD IS DRAWING NIGH
BUT ON ENTERING THE HOUSE I HEARD THE CLATTER OF CONVERSATION AND WENT IN
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE POUNDS WHICH THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO CALL SOVEREIGNS ALTHOUGH THE NAME HAS BEEN MADE ACTUALLY ILLEGAL FOR THE RENDERING OF ALL ACCOUNTS
THAT IS A MATTER OF COURSE
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ENGLISHMAN WILL THINK OF MARRYING HER THIS MADE ME VERY ANGRY
LET ANY MAN LOOK AMONG HIS FRIENDS AND SEE WHETHER MEN OF SIXTY-FIVE ARE NOT IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHO ARE STILL ASPIRING TO RISE IN THE WORLD
I CANNOT SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU IN THEORY AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD,--MY WIFE AND CHILDREN COULD NOT I AM SURE ENDURE TO SEE ME LED AWAY WHEN A CERTAIN DAY SHOULD COME,--BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT MUCH MAY BE SAID ON THE POINT AND I ADMIRE GREATLY THE ELOQUENCE AND ENERGY WHICH YOU HAVE DEVOTED TO THE MATTER
AND HOW POTENT WAS THAT LOVE OF LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN EVINCED IN THE CITY WHEN THE HOUR FOR DEPOSITION HAD BECOME NIGH
THE BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN PRINTED AND SWORN TO WHICH HAVE HAD YOUR OWN ASSENT WITH THAT OF OTHERS ARE ALL AGAINST YOU IT WAS A MISTAKE
WHEREAS A PEOPLE WHO WILL OBEY THE LAWS CANNOT BUT BE PROSPEROUS
AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE BAG THESE WERE MRS NEVERBEND'S LAST WORDS TO ME
BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF LAWS IF THEY CANNOT BE CARRIED OUT
IF WE BE NOT FOREIGNERS WHAT ARE WE MY LORD ENGLISHMEN OF COURSE SAID HE
OUR BRIDGES OUR RAILWAYS OUR GOVERNMENT ARE NOT PROVIDED FOR
WON'T THEY SIR ASKED GRAYBODY
AND IF FOR MYSELF WHY NOT FOR MY BROTHER YOU DO NOT KNOW HE SAID
LITTLE WAS THOUGHT ABOUT IT AT HOME IN ENGLAND WHEN THE BILL WAS PASSED
AS I RODE UP TO MY HOUSE THERE WAS THAT ETERNAL GUARD OF SOLDIERS,--A DOZEN MEN WITH ABOMINABLE GUNS AND UNGAINLY MILITARY HATS OR HELMETS ON THEIR HEADS
AS SOON AS I COULD ESCAPE I GOT BACK TO THE SHORE LEAVING JACK AMONG MY ENEMIES
ON MY RIGHT HAND SAT THE GOVERNOR AS I MUST NOW CALL HIM
ARE YOU GOING TO SEND THE POOR BOY TO BREAK HIS NECK AMONG THE GLACIERS
HERE IN OUR WATERS WAS LYING A TERRIBLE ENGINE OF BRITISH POWER SENT OUT BY A BRITISH CABINET MINISTER,--THE SO-CALLED MINISTER OF BENEVOLENCE BY A BITTER CHANCE,--AT THE INSTANCE OF THAT MINISTER'S NEPHEW TO PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE THE MOST ABSOLUTELY BENEVOLENT PROJECT FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF THE WORLD WHICH THE MIND OF MAN HAD EVER PROJECTED
SUCH A THING WAS NEVER HEARD OF
AND ALL THIS IS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WE HAD STRIVEN TO RISE ABOVE THE PREJUDICES OF THE DAY CRASWELLER SMILED AND SAID NOT A WORD TO OPPOSE ME AND ACCEPTED ALL MY INDIGNATION WITH ASSENT
AND THEN THE DIFFICULTY WAS SOMEWHAT INCREASED BY THE CARE AND PRECISION WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO HIS OWN BUSINESS
BUT WILL TAKE CARE THAT AS FAR AS LIES IN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S POWER HE BE TREATED WITH ALL THAT RESPECT AND HOSPITALITY WHICH WOULD BE DUE TO HIM WERE HE STILL THE PRESIDENT OF AN ALLIED REPUBLIC
WORDS MUST BE SPOKEN WHICH WOULD BE PAINFUL IN THE SPEAKING AND REGRETS MUST BE UTTERED BY ME WHICH COULD NOT CERTAINLY BE SHARED BY HIM
IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU ARE MARRIED NOW THREE MONTHS SAID JACK IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
BUT THEN THERE CAME A FURTHER DISPUTE
I TRUST THAT BEFORE MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY MAY BE BROUGHT TO AN END I MAY HAVE MANY ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED ME OF ADDRESSING YOU
THE BRITISHERS WERE MAD WITH DISMAY AS JACK WORKED HIS WAY ON THROUGH THE LAST HUNDRED
NOT EXACTLY AMONG MY OWN SHEEP
I DID HEAR FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES THAT HE STILL CONTINUED TO ASSERT THAT HE WAS ONLY NINE YEARS MY SENIOR BY WHICH HE INTENDED TO GAIN THE FAVOUR OF A POSTPONEMENT OF HIS TERM BY TWELVE POOR MONTHS
IT ANGERED ME TO THINK THAT MEN SHOULD BE SO LITTLE REASONABLE AS TO DRAW DEDUCTIONS AS TO AN ENTIRE SYSTEM FROM A SINGLE INSTANCE
BUT I AM INFORMED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE SELDOM APPROACHES TO ANY LITERARY TASTE
THROUGH THE FIRST OF THE TWO DAYS HE STOOD BEFORE HIS WICKET HITTING TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT TILL HOPE SEEMED TO SPRING UP AGAIN IN THE BOSOM OF THE BRITANNULISTS
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NONE OF THESE MOMENTS OF TRIUMPH TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED CAN HAVE COME TO ME WITHIN MY OWN HOME
WELL EVA HOW DO YOU BEAR THE LOSS OF ALL YOUR ENGLISH FRIENDS THE LOSS OF MY ENGLISH FRIENDS WON'T HURT ME IF I CAN ONLY KEEP THOSE WHICH I USED TO HAVE IN BRITANNULA I DOUBTED WHETHER SHE ALLUDED TO ME OR TO JACK
AND BARNES LUNATIC AS HE PRETENDED TO BE WOULD BE VERY HARD TO MANAGE
THREE DIVISIONS WERE MADE ON THE DEBATE AND THRICE DID THE FIXED-PERIODISTS BEAT THE OLD PARTY BY A MAJORITY OF FIFTEEN IN A HOUSE CONSISTING OF EIGHTY-FIVE MEMBERS
THAT LITTLE INSTRUMENT WHICH YOU HAVE HIDDEN IN YOUR CABIN MAKES YOU THE MASTER OF US ALL
I CANNOT CONCEAL THE FACT FROM MYSELF,--NOR FROM YOU
BUT THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE GIRL'S ENGAGEMENT TO YOUNG GRUNDLE WAS AN ESTABLISHED FACT AND IT DID NOT BEHOVE ME TO SANCTION THE BREACH OF A CONTRACT
AND BROUGHT UP BY HER MOTHER WITH ALL THE OLD PREJUDICES I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT
AND AS FOR SIR KENNINGTON OVAL I AM BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS ALL EVA'S PRETENCE
BUT WE DON'T PUT THEM ON THE TABLE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE CAN'T EAT QUITE SO MUCH DINNER AFTER THEM THIS WAS THE INVITATION WHICH CAME FROM A YOUNG NAVAL LAD WHO SEEMED TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
BUT NOW IN A GREAT MATCH THE LONG-OFFS AND THE LONG-ONS AND THE REST OF THEM ARE ALL DOUBLED
AS YEARS CREEP ON YOU CANNOT POSTPONE THEIR STEP
IN CONVERSATION WITH MY FRIEND I HAD FREQUENTLY ALLUDED TO THE VERY DAY,--TO THE HAPPY DAY AS I USED TO CALL IT BEFORE I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH HIS ACTUAL FEELINGS,--AND HE NEVER VENTURED TO DENY THAT ON THAT DAY HE WOULD BECOME SIXTY-SEVEN
AS I ROSE AND RETURNED TO THE CITY I ALMOST REPENTED MYSELF OF WHAT I HAD DONE
BUT YOU KNOW HOW THOSE THINGS ARE MANAGED I DID NOT KNOW HOW THOSE THINGS WERE MANAGED BUT I WAS SORRY THAT HE SHOULD BE THERE AS JACK DID NOT SEEM TO WANT HIM
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE ME AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO GO FREQUENTLY TO THE COLLEGE IN ORDER TO FIND A SYMPATHETIC SOUL WITH WHOM TO CONVERSE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
WELL MR NEVERBEND WILL YOU SPEAK IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE
I MY FRIENDS SHALL LEAVE THESE SHORES TO-MORROW
BUT AS I REMAINED THERE IN SILENT MEDITATION BETTER THOUGHTS CAME TO ME
THE PEOPLE WON'T HAVE IT
NOT NOW CRASWELLER I SHALL BE READY WHEN YOU MAY COME FOR ME
IT HAS NOT BEEN SUGGESTED THAT ANY ONE SHALL CREMATE YOU WHILE ALIVE BECAUSE MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE BURIED
THE SIGHT OF THINGS WHICH WOULD REMIND THE OLD MAN OF COMING DEATH
HE HAS REQUIRED THAT I SHALL BE BANISHED TO ENGLAND
HE WAS COMING IN AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AMONG THE FLOCKS AND SEEMED TO BE TRIUMPHANT AND CAREFUL AT THE SAME TIME
WE HEARD OF IT WHEN THE TIME CAME AND HEARD ALSO THAT EVA HAD DECLARED THAT SHE COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND SO QUICKLY
THERE WAS NOTHING NOW IN SO TRIFLING AN ERROR
THE DESIRE TO LIVE IS HUMAN AND THEREFORE GOD-LIKE
THERE THEN CAME ON A LONG ACTION WITH AN APPEAL,--ALL WHICH WAS GIVEN AGAINST GRUNDLE AND NEARLY RUINED THE GRUNDLES
I WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE LORD MARYLEBONE AS AN INMATE IN OUR HOUSE BUT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS ANXIOUS FOR HIM TO SAY SOMETHING AS TO HIS DEPARTURE
BUT THE TIME YOU NAME IS SO UNREASONABLE AS TO CREATE A FEELING OF HORROR AT YOUR TYRANNY A FEELING OF HORROR WOULD BE CREATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER SAID SIR FERDINANDO AT THE IDEA OF WHAT YOU MAY DO IF YOU ESCAPE US
WHAT GREAT THINGS HAD THESE MEN DONE BY CONSTANCY IN OPPOSITION TO THE WILLS AND PREJUDICES OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
A MAN RULING US,--US AND MANY OTHER MILLIONS OF SUBJECTS,--FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE CANNOT SEE OUR WANTS AND WATCH OUR PROGRESS AS WE CAN DO OURSELVES
AND THEREFORE WITH THE SENSE OF FAILURE STRONG UPON ME I SHOULD BE BETTER ELSEWHERE THAN AT HOME
SUCH AS I HAVE LEARNED HAS BEEN THE COMMON VERDICT GIVEN
AND AS I LOOK ROUND THIS VAST ROOM ON A SPOT WHICH FIFTY YEARS AGO THE MARSUPIAL RACES HAD UNDER THEIR OWN DOMINION AND SEE THE FEMININE BEAUTY AND MANLY GRACE WHICH GREET ME ON EVERY SIDE I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT SOME PECULIARLY KIND FREAK OF NATURE HAS BEEN AT WORK AND HAS TENDED TO PRODUCE A PEOPLE AS STRONG AS IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND AS CLEVER IN ITS WIT AS IT IS GRACEFUL IN ITS ACTIONS HERE THE SPEAKER PAUSED AND THE AUDIENCE ALL CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND STAMPED THEIR FEET WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO BE A VERY IMPROPER MODE OF TESTIFYING THEIR ASSENT TO THEIR OWN PRAISES
AS IT WAS I HIRED AN INSIDE CAB AND HIDING MYSELF IN THE CORNER WAS CARRIED AWAY TO THE COLLEGE UNSEEN BY ANY
IT IS SELF-EVIDENT THAT AT SIXTY-FIVE A MAN HAS DONE ALL THAT HE IS FIT TO DO
AND THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BROUGHT THEIR VISIONS DOWN TO THE PALPABLE TOUCH OF HUMANITY STILL THEY HAD PERSEVERED AND THEIR EFFORTS HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER LOST TO THE WORLD
THEY TRIED I THINK TO BUSTLE HIM BY THE RAPID SUCCESSION OF THEIR BOWLING
THERE WERE EVAITES AND ABRAHAMITES IN THE COMMUNITY
IV
I COULD NOT BUT FEEL HOW LITTLE HE KNEW OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH PREVAILED IN BRITANNULA
EVA THINKS THAT THIS DEPOSITING PLAN IS ABOMINABLE
ALAS ME
WHY THEY MUST
TO FEAR DEPARTURE;--MUST IT NOT BE THE GREATEST EVIL OF ALL OUR LIFE IF IT BE NECESSARY
TO HOW MANY DOES THAT LOT NOW FALL
NOTHING COULD BE MORE AFFECTIONATE MORE GRACIOUS OR MORE WINNING THAN SHE WAS NOW
STRENGTH IS VERY STRONG BUT IT IS NOT HALF SO POWERFUL AS WEAKNESS
I HAD ORDERED AN OPEN BAROUCHE TO BE PREPARED FOR THE OCCASION AND HAD GOT A PAIR OF SPLENDID HORSES FIT FOR A TRIUMPHAL MARCH
AT ANY RATE THERE IS NO MORE FOR YOU TO GET I CONFESS THAT AT THAT MOMENT THE IDEA OF MY BOY'S CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING WITH THE HEIRESS DID PRESENT ITSELF TO MY MIND
WAS NOT THE WORLD PEOPLED BY CRASWELLERS TALLOWAXES EXORSES AND OLD WOMEN
THOUGH I MAY NEVER LIVE TO DEPOSIT A HUMAN BEING WITHIN THAT SANCTUARY AND THOUGH I MAY BE DOOMED BY THE FOOLISH PREJUDICE OF MEN TO DRAG OUT A MISERABLE EXISTENCE AMIDST THE SORROWS AND WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
REGULARLY TO CUT THEIR THROATS YOU KNOW AND CARRY THEM OUT AND BURN THEM I DID NOT MEAN IT BUT THE LAW DID EVERY POOR OLD FELLOW WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT AN END TO WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST MERCY NOT WITHOUT MERCY I REJOINED
THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD HIS DISCIPLES WHO BELIEVED IN HIM AND THE ONE DEAR YOUTH WHO LOVED HIM SO WELL
HE IS INVINCIBLE IMPERTURBABLE AND EVER SELF-ASSURED I AS I SAT THERE LISTENING TO THIS CHARACTER OF MYSELF HEROIC SOMEWHAT BUT UTTERLY UNLIKE THE PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED FELT THAT ENGLAND KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT ME AND CARED LESS
WHEREAS IN ENGLAND I SHOULD BE NOBODY AND SHOULD ESCAPE THE CONSTANT MORTIFICATION OF SEEING SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
BUT IT WAS ESPECIALLY SAD TO HAVE TO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BRITANNULIST SO BASE SUCH A COWARD SUCH A TRAITOR AS HIMSELF TO PROPOSE THIS EXPEDIENT FOR ADDING A FEW YEARS TO HIS OWN WRETCHED LIFE
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE GOT THE BEST-FURNISHED HOUSE IN THE EMPIRE SAID I AS I THREW MYSELF ON TO A DOUBLE ARM-CHAIR AND LIGHTED MY CIGAR IN THE INNER VERANDAH
I AM BROKEN DOWN AND TRAMPLED UPON AND ALL THE GLORY IS DEPARTED FROM MY NAME AND I HAVE BECOME A BYWORD AND A REPROACH RATHER THAN A TERM OF HONOUR IN WHICH FUTURE AGES MAY REJOICE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CARRY OUT MY LONG-CHERISHED PURPOSE BY--DEPOSITING YOU AND INSURING AT LEAST YOUR DEPARTURE AND THEN CRASWELLER WOULD ANSWER ME WITH HIS GENERAL KINDLY FEELING AND I SHOULD FEEL AT THE MOMENT OF MY LEAVING HIM THE HOLLOWNESS OF HIS WORDS
SIR FERDINANDO WAS A MAN WHO THOUGHT MUCH OF HIS OWN ELOQUENCE,--AND MUCH ALSO OF THE ADVANTAGE WHICH HE MIGHT REAP FROM IT IN THE OPINION OF HIS FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN GENERALLY
CRASWELLER LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF SIR FERDINANDO
SIR FERDINANDO BROWN NOW RULES US I MUST SAY NOT WITH A ROD OF IRON BUT VERY MUCH AFTER HIS OWN GOOD WILL
TO SAY THAT MY HEART WAS SAD WITHIN ME WOULD GIVE NO FAIR RECORD OF MY CONDITION
AS THEN ALL THE WORLD WOULD KNOW THAT THOUGH BEATEN IT HAD BEEN BY THE HAND OF GOD AND NOT BY OUR DEFAULT IT ASTONISHED ME TO FIND THAT THE BOY WAS QUITE AS EAGER ABOUT HIS CRICKET AS I WAS ABOUT MY FIXED PERIOD
EVA WILL BE WITH ME AND PERHAPS JACK MAY COME AND SEE ME,--THOUGH I MUST NOT ALLOW JACK TO EXPRESS THE WARMTH OF HIS INDIGNATION IN EVA'S HEARING
I THINK IT RIGHT TO TELL YOU SIR THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A PUBLIC MEETING ON THE TOWN FLAGS THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW THE TOWN FLAGS WAS AN OPEN UNENCLOSED PLACE OVER WHICH SUPPORTED BY ARCHES WAS ERECTED THE TOWN HALL
I OWN THAT I AM NO MORE THAN MAN
AND I COULD SEE THAT THE ENGLISHMEN WERE BECOMING NERVOUS AND UNEASY ALTHOUGH THE ODDS WERE STILL MUCH IN THEIR FAVOUR
IN FACT THERE WAS NOT A WORD TO BE SAID AGAINST US EXCEPT THAT WHICH REFERRED TO THE FEELINGS OF THE YOUNG AND OLD
BUT ALL THAT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION HAD TO BE FORGOTTEN AND I WAS TO GREET MY OLD FRIEND WITH TRUE AFFECTION AS THOUGH I HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS HANDS NO SUCH RUTHLESS RUIN OF ALL MY HOPES
THE CAPTAIN WOULD HAVE COME UP HIMSELF BUT HE CAN'T LEAVE THE SHIP BEFORE HE SEES HIS BIG GUN LAID ON AND MADE SAFE
AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN SHOWING HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE ALLOWED SIR KENNINGTON TO START IN ADVANCE AND HAD RUN INTO LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH BICYCLE QUAY BEFORE HIM
AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT AT SPEAKING
AND THOUGH HE HAD YIELDED WITHOUT FORTITUDE HE HAD DONE SO TO COMPLY WITH MY WISHES AND I COULD NOT BUT FEEL FOR THE MAN AN EXTRAORDINARY AFFECTION
YOU DON'T SEE IT
BUT I TOLD HER WHETHER TRULY OR NOT I HARDLY THEN KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE NO ROOM FOR HER ON BOARD A SHIP OF WAR SUCH AS THE JOHN BRIGHT
BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT IN WHAT I HAVE READ OF BRITISH DEBATES THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ELOQUENT AFTER THIS FASHION ARE GENERALLY FIRM TO SOME PURPOSE OF SELF-INTEREST
I DO SAID CRASWELLER
THERE I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF AS BEST I MIGHT BY THINKING OF THE BRILLIANT NATURE OF JACK'S PROSPECTS
JACK HAD HIS CHEEK CUT OPEN BY A BALL RUNNING OFF HIS BAT ON TO HIS FACE
I WILL ASK YOUR FAVOUR FOR A FEW MINUTES
HOW MANY NOW LACK THE COMFORTS THEY CANNOT EARN FOR THEMSELVES
MY POSITION AS PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC DID DEMAND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PERSONAL DIGNITY
LOOKING BACK AS I DID AT THIS MOMENT ON THE PAST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE AND JACK WHO WERE THE TWO PERSONS I LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD HAD BEEN THE ENEMIES WHO HAD ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY CONSPIRED AGAINST ME
CRASWELLER WHO WAS A MEMBER AND WHO TOOK HIS SEAT DURING THESE DEBATES WITHOUT VENTURING TO SPEAK MERELY WHISPERED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR THAT THE HEARTLESS GREEDY FELLOW WAS UNWILLING TO WAIT FOR THE WOOLS OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
FOR IN TRUTH I DID BELIEVE AT THAT MOMENT THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO THE BARONET
BUT ALL THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SAID AND I COULD NOT VERY WELL INTERRUPT HIM
I SWORE TO HER THAT I WOULD DO THE BEST I COULD AND SHE SAID THAT IF I COULD SUCCEED THEN--SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD LOVE ME
BUT IT BECAME IMMEDIATELY NECESSARY TO TAKE STEPS TO STOP THE EVIL AND I WAS THE MORE BOUND TO DO SO BECAUSE THE ONLY DELINQUENT NAMED TO ME WAS MY OWN SON
BUT WHAT SHALL I DO SUPPOSE THEY TAKE TO RUNNING AWAY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED
ALL BRITANNULA KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE THE FIRST AND THAT HE WAS TO BE DEPOSITED ON THE 13TH OF JUNE 1980
BUT IT WOULD BE BEST WERE IT NOT THAT CERTAIN SCRUPLES PREVENT ONE
SIR SAID JACK AS WE WALKED ON I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING WHAT IS IT SOMETHING OF MOST EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO ME
IT IS NOT WITH HIM AS IT IS WITH YOU WHO HAVE YOUR HEART IN THE MATTER BECAUSE YOU THINK OF SOME GREAT THING THAT YOU WILL DO SO THAT YOUR NAME MAY BE REMEMBERED TO FUTURE GENERATIONS IT IS NOT FOR THAT EVA
IT GRIEVED ME GREATLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE INHABITANTS OF GLADSTONOPOLIS WOULD RISE IN TUMULT AND DESTROY THE COLLEGE MERELY TO FAVOUR THE VIEWS OF A PRETTY GIRL
I MUST BY NO MEANS SHOW IN SUCH COMPANY AS WAS NOW PRESENT THE STRONG FEELING WHICH PERVADED MY OWN MIND
I HAD IT IN MY HEART TO GO BACK AND YIELD AND TO TELL HIM THAT I WOULD ASSENT TO THE ABANDONMENT OF MY WHOLE PROJECT
THERE WERE THE THREE MEN WITH WHOM TO WORK DURING THE DAY
AND ALTHOUGH IN MY MIND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT ABRAHAM GRUNDLE HAD ONLY DONE HIS DUTY AS A SENATOR THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT VIEW OF THE CASE A JURY MIGHT TAKE IN GLADSTONOPOLIS
NOW I EXPECTED NOTHING OF THE KIND AND IT GRIEVED ME TO THINK THAT I SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO SUCH FALSE EXCUSES
BUT SIR FERDINANDO IS QUITE RIGHT IN EXPECTING THAT HE PERSONALLY WILL RECEIVE EVERY COURTESY FROM THE BRITANNULISTS
NEVERTHELESS I BECAME VERY FOND OF HIM AND FOUND IN HIM AN OPPONENT TO THE FIXED PERIOD THAT HAS DONE MORE TO SHAKE MY OPINION THAN CRASWELLER WITH ALL HIS FEELINGS OR SIR FERDINANDO WITH ALL HIS ARGUMENTS
BUT I KNEW WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH HER MIND
AS THE ENTHUSIASM HAD WORN OFF MEN HAD ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER THE MONEY HAD NOT BEEN WASTED AND HAD SAID THAT FOR SO SMALL A COMMUNITY THE COLLEGE HAD BEEN PLANNED ON AN ABSURDLY GRAND SCALE
IT WAS ON THIS OCCASION THAT THE TRACK WAS FIRST DIVIDED FOR COMERS AND GOERS AND THAT VOLUNTEERS WERE SET TO PREVENT STRAGGLERS FROM CROSSING EXCEPT BY THE REGULAR BRIDGES
AS CUSTOM HAS ARRANGED SUCH A PERIOD OF MOURNING FOR A WIDOW AND SUCH ANOTHER FOR A WIDOWER A SON OR A DAUGHTER
FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SAID CRASWELLER JUMPING UP
AT THE COMMAND OF HIS SOVEREIGN HE MAY STILL LIVE TO CARRY OUT THE FIXED PERIOD SOMEWHERE IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA NEVER IN WHAT COLLEGE AMONG THE NEGROES HE MAY BE DEPOSITED IT MAY BE TOO CURIOUS TO INQUIRE
THERE CAN BE NO POSTPONEMENT FOR THE FIXED PERIOD IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE SIXTY-NINE OR SEVENTY SAID HE
I ASKED THEM IN COMMITTEE WHETHER THEY WERE PREPARED TO PROVE THAT THE 969 YEARS AS SPOKEN OF IN GENESIS WERE THE SAME MEASURE OF TIME AS 969 YEARS NOW AND TOLD THEM THAT IF THE SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS OF THE WORLD WOULD AGAIN PERMIT MEN TO LIVE AS LONG AS THE PATRIARCHS WE WOULD GLADLY CHANGE THE FIXED PERIOD
VOLUME II
VOLUME II
THE LAW SAYS THAT HE SHALL BE DEPOSITED ON A CERTAIN DAY HE WILL BECOME AS NOBODY IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SAID I WITH ALL THE AUTHORITY OF A PRESIDENT
MRS NEVERBEND YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
WE HAD RECEIVED DETAILS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR BY WATER-TELEGRAM BEFORE THE JOHN BRIGHT STARTED
I HAD PLEDGED MY WORD
HAVE YOU FORMED ANY IDEA IN YOUR OWN MIND OF THE SUBJECTION TO THE LAW WHICH IS DEMANDED FROM ALL GOOD CITIZENS
BUT TO LIVE AS THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WHO HAD FIXED HIS ASPIRATIONS SO HIGH WOULD INDEED BE VERY MELANCHOLY
IT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE THE AGONY OF THAT MOMENT
BUT AGAIN I BETHOUGHT ME OF COLUMBUS AND GALILEO AND SWORE THAT I WOULD GO ON OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT
I DO NOT AT THIS MINUTE DOUBT BUT THAT CRASWELLER WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED HAD NOT THE JOHN BRIGHT APPEARED
HERE IN BRITANNULA I SHOULD BE THE EX-PRESIDENT OF AN ABOLISHED REPUBLIC AND AS SUCH SUBJECT TO THE NOTICE OF ALL MEN
HE REALLY ROSE TO A GREAT HEIGHT OF PARLIAMENTARY EXCELLENCE AND ALTOGETHER CARRIED WITH HIM THE YOUNGER AND LUCKILY THE GREATER PART OF THE HOUSE
THERE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SCUM OF THE POPULATION,--THE DIRTY FROTHY MEANINGLESS FOAM AT THE TOP,--MEN LIKE THE DRUNKEN OLD BAR-KEEPER WHO HAD STILL CLUNG SUBMISSIVE TO THE OLD COUNTRY,--MEN WHO KNEW NOTHING OF PROGRESS AND CIVILISATION,--WHO WERE CONTENT WITH WHAT THEY ATE AND DRANK AND CHIEFLY WITH THE LATTER
THE FIXED PERIOD HAS BEEN SO FAR DISCUSSED AS TO MAKE IT ALMOST UNNECESSARY FOR ME TO EXPLAIN ITS TENETS THOUGH ITS ADVANTAGES MAY REQUIRE A FEW WORDS OF ARGUMENT IN A WORLD THAT IS AT PRESENT DEAD TO ITS CHARMS
EXORS SAYS THAT THE LAW IS BAD AND YOU CAN'T TOUCH HIM
MY READERS WILL PERCEIVE THAT I AM AN ENTHUSIAST
YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME ANY WRINKLES AS TO A PLEASANT MODE OF GOVERNING
WHAT WAS PATHETIC IN THE MATTER I MIGHT ALTOGETHER IGNORE
AS I THOUGHT OF THIS I SAID TO MYSELF THAT EVA'S PRAYERS MIGHT NOT AVAIL AND I DID TAKE SOME COMFORT TO MYSELF IN THINKING THAT ALL WAS DONE FOR THE SAKE OF POSTERITY
BUT EVA FOLLOWED HIM AND SPREAD A RUG ACROSS HIS KNEES AND THREW A CLOAK OVER HIS SHOULDERS
I DID ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE FESTIVITY GLANCE ROUND AT OLD CRASWELLER
AS HE TOOK HIS PLACE UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS GREAT CHEERING
I LEFT MY FRIEND RUGGLES IN THE STREET AND PASSED ON TO THE EXECUTIVE HALL IN A VERY PAINFUL FRAME OF MIND
BUT IT HAD ITS PERIOD OF SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY THOUGH NEVER OF REBELLION,--LIKE ITS ELDER SISTER NEW ZEALAND
BUT HE SAT LOOKING AT ME WITHOUT REPLY
OH YES SAID I TO THE YOUNG MAN I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING TO THAT EFFECT BETWEEN YOU AND EVA'S FATHER AND BETWEEN ME AND EVA I CAN ASSURE YOU HAVING OBSERVED THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY I COULD NOT DENY THE TRUTH OF THIS ASSERTION
AND CRASWELLER IS A DEAL FITTER FOR HIS WORK THAN FOR LIVING IDLE IN THE COLLEGE TILL YOU SHALL PUT AN END TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH IN THESE WORDS WHICH MADE ME VERY ANGRY
IN IT RELIGION WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR
OTHERS FOLLOWED US AND WE SETTLED OURSELVES WITH GREAT PROSPERITY
IF HE WILL LOOK BACK THIRTY YEARS HE WILL FIND THAT HE HAD HARDLY CONTEMPLATED EVEN THE WEATHER-WATCH WHICH HE NOW WEARS CONSTANTLY IN HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET
I WANTED NO ENGLISHMAN NOR AMERICAN TO COME AND SEE THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FIXED PERIOD
HAD THEY BELIEVED THAT THE FIXED PERIOD WOULD EVER HAVE BECOME LAW THEY WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED US TO BE LAW-MAKERS
AND WHAT MAY YOU BE I AM THE SECOND LIEUTENANT ON BOARD H.M.'S GUNBOAT THE JOHN BRIGHT I HAD HEARD OF THIS VESSEL WHICH HAD BEEN NAMED FROM A GALLANT OFFICER WHO IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A BARREL OF GUNPOWDER AND HAD SINGLE-HANDED QUELLED A MUTINY
ON THE FIRST SEAT BEHIND THE CHAIR SAT CAPTAIN BATTLEAX WITH FOUR OR FIVE OF HIS OFFICERS BEHIND HIM
GABRIEL CRASWELLER WAS ALMOST MY DEAREST FRIEND AND AS HIS GIRL GREW UP IT WAS A MATTER OF REGRET TO ME THAT MY ONLY SON WAS NOT QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER HUSBAND
WERE ANOTHER TO USE HARSH LANGUAGE TO ME SHE WOULD RISE IN WRATH TO DEFEND ME
HE HAS TOLD US THAT IT IS FITTING THAT WE SHOULD LEAVE THE QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH IN THE HANDS OF THE ALMIGHTY
THE PREJUDICES OF PEOPLE OF THIS CLASS ARE SO STRONG AS TO BE ABSOLUTELY INVINCIBLE
AND I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS INSTIGATED TO DO SO BY MY OWN WIFE
HE DID NOT WISH EITHER TO LOSE HIS MONEY OR TO BET AGAINST HIMSELF
THEN CAME UPON ME FOR THE FIRST TIME AN IDEA THAT I WAS NOT WANTED IN ENGLAND AT ALL,--THAT I WAS SIMPLY TO BE BROUGHT AWAY FROM MY OWN HOME TO AVOID THE SUPPOSED MISCHIEF I MIGHT DO THERE AND THAT FOR ALL BRITISH PURPOSES IT WOULD BE WELL THAT I SHOULD BE DROPPED INTO THE SEA OR LEFT ASHORE ON SOME DESERT ISLAND
I ROBBED NO ONE
AS THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE COMMUNITY NOTHING IS SO ABHORRENT TO ME AS REBELLION
AND MINE IS NINE YEARS EARLIER
I DO THINK THAT AS THE FIRST VICTIM I HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT ONE YEAR SHOULD BE GRANTED ME
HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY SHEEP ON THE PLACE FOR THE SAKE OF HALF AN HOUR WITH EVA ALONE IN THE WOODS
MR PRESIDENT SAID ONE OLD GENTLEMAN TO ME A TANNER IN THE CITY THERE'S AN ENGLISH SHIP OF WAR COME INTO THE HARBOUR
THERE HAD BEEN ENTHUSIASM THEN AND THE DIFFERENT CLAUSES HAD BEEN CARRIED BY LARGE MAJORITIES
HE WAS LIKE A SILLY BOY HARDLY DARING TO LOOK HER IN THE FACE INSTEAD OF THE GALLANT CAPTAIN OF THE BAND WHO HAD TRIUMPHED OVER ALL OBSTACLES
THEN THERE WAS A SHUFFLING OF FEET AS OF A CROWD GOING AWAY
BUT LOOKING FORWARD I COULD SEE AT A GLANCE THAT IF ONE OR TWO WEALTHY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WERE THUS TO ESCAPE IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE LAW WITH REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO SHOULD HAVE NO SUCH MEANS
HE TOO WAS A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN AND THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS BEAUTIFULLY WHITE HAD FEWER OF THE SYMPTOMS OF AGE THAN ANY OLD MAN I HAD BEFORE KNOWN
COULD HE REALLY WISH IN HIS CONDITION TO SEND HIS DAUGHTER AWAY TO ENGLAND SIMPLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE A BARONET'S WIFE
IT WAS WITH SAD GRIEF OF HEART THAT I SO DETERMINED
IT IS THE LAW TALLOWAX SWEARS HE'LL HAVE HIMSELF STRAPPED TO HIS OWN KITCHEN TABLE AND DEFEND HIMSELF TO THE LAST GASP WITH A CARVING-KNIFE
I WAS WELL AWARE EVEN THEN THAT MY THEORY WAS TRUE
THEN AT THE INSTANCE OF THIS LAD A LEVIATHAN OF WAR WAS TO BE SENT OUT TO CRUSH US UNLESS WE WOULD CONSENT TO PUT DOWN THE CHERISHED CONVICTION OF OUR HEARTS
THE PLACE WAS CALLED NECROPOLIS
WE HAVE BEEN LABORIOUS CONTENTED AND PROSPEROUS
THERE WAS NO DOUBT A SPECIAL CAUSE WITH US WHICH DID NOT EXIST IN AUSTRALIA AND WHICH WAS ONLY IN PART UNDERSTOOD BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHEN WE BRITANNULISTS WERE ALLOWED TO STAND BY OURSELVES
WITH MY WIFE AND SON I COULD STILL BE BRAVE,--EVEN WITH CRASWELLER I COULD BE CONSTANT AND HARD
AND THOSE UNFORTUNATES WHO HAD TO STAND UP WITH JACK WERE SO AFRAID OF THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE LIKE YOUNG COUNTRY ORATORS ABOUT TO MAKE THEIR FIRST SPEECHES
BUT I THINK SHE TOUCHED ME MOST WITH JUST A ROLY-POLY PUDDING WHICH SHE MADE WITH HER OWN FAIR HANDS FOR OUR DINNER ONE SUNDAY AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
WE ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH RUSSIA
DRUG THEM AND MAKE THEM SENSELESS
THE BUSINESS AND PLEASURES OF LIFE AT THE PRESCRIBED TIME WERE IN GENERAL BUT A PRETENCE AT BUSINESS AND A REMINISCENCE OF PLEASURE
IT WAS SAID THAT THE SECLUSION WITHIN THE COLLEGE WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO PENAL DEPARTURE AND THAT THE OLD MEN SHOULD THUS HAVE THE LAST LINGERING DROPS OF BREATH ALLOWED THEM WITHOUT IN THE WORLD AT LARGE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MANAGE THIS EXACTLY
AT LAST THE MOMENT CAME WHEN ONE OF THE JUNIOR OFFICERS CAME UP TO CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND TOLD HIM THAT THE VESSEL WAS READY TO START
WE CAME OUT UNDER THE RULE OF THAT TYRANT KING MACNUFFERY
THE TEMPTATION HAD HE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH EVA,--WITH EVA AND THE GENUINE DOWNRIGHT HONEST LOVE OF MY GALLANT BOY
WHO WILL PUBLISH IT
I THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING HIGHER TO BE ACHIEVED THAN AN EXTRA YEAR OR TWO AMONG THE PRETTINESSES OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
THOSE OTHER MEN HAD DETERMINED TO REBEL SINCE THE FEELING OF THE FIXED PERIOD CAME NEAR TO THEM
AND THESE HOPES HAVE BEEN FOUNDED ALTOGETHER ON THE POSITION WHICH YOU MIGHT OCCUPY I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD UP IN THAT COLLEGE NEVERBEND I WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH YOU I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD ALL THE SAME
IF HE CAN TOUCH A BALL FROM OUR STEAM-BOWLER WHEN I SEND IT I SHALL THINK MORE OF HIS ARMS THAN I DO OF HIS LEGS AND MORE OF HIS EYES THAN I DO OF HIS LUNGS
SHE NEVER INTERFERED WITH PUBLIC BUSINESS BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF TALKING ABOUT HOUSEHOLD MATTERS IN WHICH SHE WAS ALWAYS VICTORIOUS
AND SINCE I HAD FIRST THOUGHT OF THE FIXED PERIOD I HAD BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO NOTE FAITHFULLY THE BIRTHS AS THEY OCCURRED
I HAD TWO SIDES TO MY CHARACTER AND COULD SEE MYSELF SITTING IN LUXURIOUS COMFORT AMIDST THE FURNITURE OF CRASWELLER'S VERANDAH WHILE EVA AND HER CHILDREN WERE AROUND AND JACK WAS STANDING WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH OUTSIDE LAYING DOWN THE LAW FOR THE CRICKETERS AT GLADSTONOPOLIS
ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEPARTURE I SAID,--"AFRAID OF THAT WHICH MUST COME
HOWEVER HE HAD SCORED 150
HE HAD BEEN MADE EARL BRIGHT FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE ON THAT OCCASION BUT THE VESSEL WAS STILL CALLED J
THAT I SHALL NEVER SPEND THAT LAST HAPPY YEAR WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE COLLEGE IS TO ME FROM A SELFISH POINT OF VIEW THE SADDEST PART OF ENGLAND'S REASSUMING OUR ISLAND AS A COLONY
I WAS TAKING THIS MAN HOME FOR THAT LAST GLORIOUS YEAR WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO PASS IN JOYFUL ANTICIPATION OF A HAPPIER LIFE
WE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SLACK PERHAPS IN INSTITUTING A NATIONAL MINT
I HAD BEEN OF LATE SO ABSORBED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE FIXED PERIOD THAT I HAD ALTOGETHER FORGOTTEN THE CRICKET-MATCH AND THE NOBLE STRANGERS WHO WERE ABOUT TO COME TO OUR SHORES
BUT WE WERE ESSENTIALLY A YOUNG COMMUNITY
CHAPTER I
THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES WAS HOSTILE TO US ON THE VERY MATTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT SURRENDER HIM IN OBEDIENCE TO ANY LAW OF EXTRADITION
I DO NOT MEAN TO DESTROY MYSELF DON'T DO THAT SAID THE LIEUTENANT IN A PITEOUS TONE
NOW YOU CAN PROCEED TO DO YOUR WORK THAT HAVING ALL BEEN PLEASANTLY SETTLED SAID SIR FERDINANDO WITH A SMILE I WILL ASK YOU TO READ THE DOCUMENT BY WHICH THIS DUTY HAS BEEN PLACED IN MY HANDS HE THEN TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM BY THE DUKE OF HATFIELD AS MINISTER FOR THE CROWN COLONIES AND GAVE IT TO ME TO READ
BUT GRUNDLE WHO HAD NOW BECOME QUITE PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHO LAMENTED LOUDLY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED SO SEVERE AN INJURY IN PREPARING FOR THE GAME WOULD NOT LET THIS PASS
AND JACK IS ALL,--ALL THAT HE OUGHT TO BE
THERE I HAD RECEIVED THE CREDIT DUE TO A TENDER HEART AND LOVING FEELINGS
BUT I SHALL RULE BY THE AID OF YOUR LAWS NOT THE FIXED PERIOD LAW SAID EXORS WHO WAS SEATED ON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE ORATOR
IT WAS THE MALEVOLENT INFLUENCE OF THE INTELLECT APPLIED TO BRUTE FORCE DOMINATING ITS BENEVOLENT INFLUENCE AS APPLIED TO PHILANTHROPY
THE TIME MIGHT PERHAPS COME WHEN I TOO SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND WHEN HER FATHER SHOULD LONG SINCE HAVE BEEN AT REST THAT SOFTER THOUGHTS WOULD COME ACROSS HER MIND
WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HUMAN NATURE HAD NEVER ENDEAVOURED TO TRAIN ITSELF
AND THEREFORE I BELONGED NATURALLY TO THE OTHER SIDE
WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO RETURN AT ONCE TO MY OWN COUNTRY,--IF ONLY I MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO DO SO
IT CERTAINLY SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD DONE IT ON PURPOSE
YES THERE IS THE LAW,--IF IT BE A LAW
THE FIXED PERIOD WITH ALL ITS DAMNABLE CERTAINTY IS A MISTAKE
HE IS A MAN NOW AND HAS A RIGHT TO HIS OWN OPINION AS WELL AS ANOTHER JACK SAID I WITH MUCH SOLEMNITY DO YOU VALUE YOUR FATHER'S BLESSING WELL
PAPA IS TO BE SACRIFICED TO THE LAW TO SUIT YOUR PLEASURE
EVA HAD BEEN TO ME ALMOST AS A DAUGHTER AND YET I WAS COMPELLED TO REFUSE HER REQUEST FOR HER FATHER'S LIFE
I CARE NOT AT ALL WHETHER MY NAME BE REMEMBERED
INDEED MRS NEVERBEND IS A LADY UPON WHOM ARGUMENT IS FOR THE MOST PART THROWN AWAY
ALLOW ME TO RECOMMEND YOU A BIT OF ICE-PUDDING
THIS SHOULD BE PREVENTED IN THE INTERESTS BOTH OF THE YOUNG AND OF THOSE WHO DO BECOME OLD WHEN OBLIGED TO LINGER ON AFTER THEIR PERIOD OF WORK IS OVER
I HAVE NEVER PUSHED THE QUESTION MUCH LEST I SHOULD SEEM AS HAVE DONE SOME PRESIDENTS OVER ANXIOUS TO EXHIBIT MYSELF
JACK NEVERBEND
JACK NEVERBEND
THEY TO WHOM I MUST BE THE CAUSE OF SOME LITTLE TROUBLE WILL SIMPLY WISH ME OUT OF THE WAY
JACK SAID I IN THIS LITTLE CONTEST WHICH THERE HAS BEEN BETWEEN US YOU HAVE GOT THE BETTER IN EVERYTHING NOBODY THOUGHT SO WHEN THEY HEARD YOUR ANSWER TO SIR FERDINANDO LAST NIGHT WELL YES
THE OLD AND EFFETE SHOULD GO IN ORDER THAT THE STRONG AND MANLIKE MIGHT RISE IN THEIR PLACES AND DO THE WORK OF THE WORLD WITH THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD AT THEIR COMMAND
BUT AT A VERY LONG INTERVAL
THEREFORE THE GAME WAS ULTIMATELY PLAYED WITH THIRTY COMBATANTS
NO DOUBT A HUNDRED LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE NECESSARY BEFORE THE AFFAIRS OF THE INSTITUTION COULD BE GOT INTO A GROOVE SO AS TO RUN STEADILY
IS THAT THE WAY TO MAKE A MAN COMFORTABLE AT THE PROSPECT OF LEAVING THIS WORLD
BUT IT WAS ONLY AN ACCIDENT THAT IT SHOULD COME ON THIS VERY DAY AND THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THINGS ARE TO BE MANAGED IN BRITANNULA
I SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOT A MAN OR WOMAN IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WAS NOT ACCURATELY AWARE OF THE VERY DAY OF CRASWELLER'S BIRTH
THE GREAT OBJECT ON OUR SIDE WAS THAT JACK SHOULD AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE BE ALWAYS OPPOSITE TO THE BOWLER
THEN IT CAME TO BE JACK'S TURN AND HE AT ONCE SCORED THIRTY-NINE DURING THE OVER LEAVING HIMSELF AT THE PROPER WICKET FOR RE-COMMENCING THE OPERATION
YES I'M SURE OF IT
BUT I HAVEN'T GOT THE BETTER OF YOU I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING SAID JACK IN A MELANCHOLY TONE OF VOICE
AS MR CROSSTREES BECAME MY PERSONAL FRIEND DURING THE VOYAGE,--MORE PECULIARLY THAN ANY OF THE OTHER OFFICERS ALL OF WHOM WERE MY FRIENDS,--I WILL GIVE SOME SHORT DESCRIPTION OF HIM
MRS NEVERBEND AT ONCE WENT TO WORK TO PROVIDE FOR MY ENFORCED ABSENCE AND IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY EVA CRASWELLER CAME IN TO HELP HER
EVA HAD SAID THAT SHE WOULD NEVER LET ME EVEN SPEAK TO HER AS LONG AS HER FATHER'S LIFE WAS IN DANGER
BEFORE THOSE NEXT TEN YEARS ARE GONE SHE WOULD SAY COMMON-SENSE WILL HAVE INTERFERED TO LET FOLKS LIVE OUT THEIR LIVES PROPERLY IT HAD BEEN QUITE USELESS FOR ME TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND HOW UNFITTING WAS SUCH A SPEECH FOR THE WIFE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
I NEED ONLY GO BEFORE THE EXECUTIVE OF WHICH I MYSELF WAS THE CHIEF DESIRE THAT THE ESTABLISHED DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE SEARCHED AND DEMAND THE BODY OF GABRIEL CRASWELLER TO BE DEPOSITED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW AS ENACTED
VIII
I STRONGLY ADVISE HIM TO BE GOVERNED IN THIS MATTER BY HIS FATHER JACK ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND LEFT THE ROOM
DID NOT THE FIRST CHRISTIANS ALL SUFFER AFFLICTION POVERTY AND MARTYRDOM
WHEN THE TRUMPET SOUNDED DID NOT I FEEL THE HONOUR MORE THAN HE
OR BETTER STILL COME DOWN UPON THEM WITH ABSOLUTE POWER AND CARRY THEM AWAY TO INSTANT DEATH
AND NOTHING THAT HE WOULD NOT DO FOR YOU MY DEAR
I MUST GO TO WORK AND WITH PEN INK AND PAPER WITH LONG WRITTEN ARGUMENTS AND STUDIED LOGIC ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE TO MANKIND THAT THE WORLD SHOULD NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO ENDURE THE INDIGNITIES AND WEAKNESS AND SELFISH MISERY OF EXTREME OLD AGE
THE CREMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN ELSEWHERE A MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ANGEL TO ENDURE IT,--OR SO MUCH LESS THAN A MAN
AFTER THAT JACK SEEMED TO BE MAD WITH CRICKETING POWER
ONLY YESTERDAY HE HAD INSULTED ABRAHAM GROSSLY AND AS I HAD REASON TO SUSPECT HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE OUT TO CHRISTCHURCH ON SOME CLANDESTINE OBJECT AS TO WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY HE THOUGHT TO KEEP OLD CRASWELLER IN THE DARK
WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO US TO RUSH INTO HIS PRESENCE BY ANY DEED OF OUR OWN
BUT WE DID NOT HEAR IT DIRECT FROM EVA NOR YET FROM CRASWELLER
BUT I'VE TOLD HER THAT SHE MUST BE VERY FOND OF YOU
I WAS TOLD TOO THAT AFTER THE INVITATIONS HAD BEEN WRITTEN NO MILLINER IN BRITANNULA WAS ALLOWED TO SLEEP A SINGLE MOMENT TILL HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE LADIES WERE ASSEMBLED IN OUR DRAWING-ROOM
I STRUGGLED,--FOR YOUR SAKE
WHO SHALL SAY WHAT THE FUTURE MAY DISCLOSE
THE WHOLE DREAM OF MY EXISTENCE WHICH HAS COME SO NEAR TO THE FRUITION OF A WAKING MOMENT IS TO BE VIOLENTLY DISPELLED BECAUSE MY OWN SON AND SIR KENNINGTON OVAL HAVE SETTLED BETWEEN THEM THAT A PRETTY GIRL IS TO HAVE HER OWN WAY AS I THOUGHT OF IT THERE SEEMED TO BE A MONSTROUS CRUELTY AND POTENCY IN FORTUNE WHICH SHE NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO EXERCISE IN A WORLD WHICH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER GIVEN OVER TO INJUSTICE
ALL THIS HAD RECEIVED A CHECK WHEN HE IN HIS WEAKNESS HAD PLEADED FOR ANOTHER YEAR
ONCE ON SHORE THERE I SHALL GO TO WORK ON A VOLUME OF ALTOGETHER A DIFFERENT NATURE AND ENDEAVOUR TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE AND STATISTICAL AS I HAVE HERE BEEN FANCIFUL THOUGH TRUE TO DETAILS
CRASWELLER I SAID IT IS CERTAINLY NOT WELL THAT YOU AND I SHOULD QUARREL ON THIS MATTER
WHEN HE MADE HIS LAST TRIUMPHANT RUN AND I THREW MY HAT IN THE AIR WAS IT NOT TO ME SWEETER THAN IF I HAD DONE IT MYSELF
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND JACK'S TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE
WE HAD SEPARATED OURSELVES FROM GREAT BRITAIN WITHOUT COMING TO BLOWS INDEED
AND WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN OPERATING ALSO ON MANY OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD COME INTO THE WORLD BEFORE THE GREAT LAW
AND THEY WOULD DEPART WITH THE FULL RESPECT OF ALL THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS
BYGONES HAVE TO BE BYGONES,--PARTICULARLY AS NO HARM HAS BEEN DONE THEN HE LEFT THE ROOM
THEN I LOOKED AND SAW THAT EVA GOT INTO A SMALL CLOSED CARRIAGE IN THE REAR AND WAS DRIVEN OFF BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO MEET US NO DOUBT AT THE COLLEGE
I LEARNT AFTERWARDS THAT HE IMMEDIATELY PUT HIS FEET UP ON THE SOFA AND SLEPT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING
IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER A BAD SHOP FOR GRUBBING AS I LOOKED ROUND I THOUGHT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE PALATIAL AND BEAUTIFUL
ON LOOKING ROUND I SAW JACK AND WITH JACK I SAW ALSO A LADY SHROUDED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN BLACK GARMENTS WITH A VEIL OVER HER FACE WHOM I KNEW FROM THE LITTLE ROUND HAT UPON HER HEAD TO BE EVA
THEY TOSSED FOR THE FIRST INNINGS AND THE ENGLISH CLUB WON IT
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST THE WISDOM OF THAT MAN CONTINUED HE TURNING TO ME AGAIN
BUT THERE IS A PREJUDICE ABOUT KILLING AN OLD MAN OR A WOMAN
I DID NOT MYSELF CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT WINDSOR CASTLE
BUT I KNEW AS I WAS DOING SO THAT THAT WAS ALL IN VAIN
IF I COULD ONLY GET THEM TO GO BEFORE THE MATTER WAS AGAIN DEBATED IT MIGHT BE THAT NO STRONG PUBLIC FEELING WOULD BE EXCITED IN ENGLAND TILL IT WAS TOO LATE
I KNOW THE TIME WELL I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT SO
BUT PAPA IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HAS ALL HIS WITS ABOUT HIM A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN MR GRUNDLE
BUT STILL OUR OWN FLAG THE SOUTHERN CROSS FLEW AS PROUDLY TO OUR GENTLE BREEZES AS EVER HAD DONE THE UNION-JACK AMIDST THE INCLEMENCY OF A BRITISH WINTER
AND I WAS GOING WITH ASPIRATIONS IN MY HEART SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH HE ENTERTAINED
THEN IT WAS THAT WITH AN ABSENCE OF THAT PRESENCE OF MIND WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF A REPUBLIC SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER I TOOK OFF MY HAT AND FLUNG IT INTO THE AIR
OF COURSE I HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE AND HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT LORD MARYLEBONE WAS TO BE OUR GUEST
AND I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE NEVER USED THE WORD AGAINST ME AGAIN
DON'T YOU THINK THAT JACK NEVERBEND IS QUITE OLD ENOUGH TO MARRY A WIFE AND THAT HE ONLY NEEDS BE TOLD TO MAKE UP HIS MIND TO DO IT
I CONFESS THAT I FOR ONE WAS NOT AT FIRST PREPARED TO OBEY
BUT BOBBS I THINK GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
I HAD LATELY READ HOW FEELINGS HAD BEEN ALLOWED IN ENGLAND TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE GREAT WORK OF CREMATION
WE HAD A LENGTHENED CORRESPONDENCE ALSO WITH NEW ZEALAND AND WITH AUSTRALIA
IN THOSE LAST WORDS OF HIS HE HAD CONFINED HIMSELF TO THE FIXED PERIOD SO FULL HAD HIS HEART BEEN OF THE SUBJECT AND SO INTENT HAD HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE ON CONVINCING ME
I THEREFORE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM WHEN THEY SHOULDERED THEIR ARMS BUT WENT INTO THE HOUSE TO GIVE MY WIFE HER LAST KISS
IT IS NOT ONLY THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE ME BUT THAT I AM MYSELF ANXIOUS TO BE IN ENGLAND YOU WISH TO--TO PREACH THE FIXED PERIOD WELL MY DEAR I HAVE GOT MY OWN NOTIONS WHICH AT MY TIME OF LIFE I CANNOT LAY ASIDE
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WILL EVEN KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO CREMATE HIM HE WILL BE THE FIRST MR PRESIDENT
BUT HE HAD YIELDED
I SHALL GO TO ENGLAND AND I SHALL THERE USE WHAT LITTLE STRENGTH REMAINS TO ME IN MY ENDEAVOUR TO PUT FORWARD THOSE ARGUMENTS FOR CONQUERING THE PREJUDICES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH HAVE PREVAILED HERE BUT WHICH I AM VERY SURE WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT UPON SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
BUT 250-TON SWIVELLERS DO COST MONEY AND THE JOHN BRIGHT MUST STEAM AWAY AND PLAY ITS PART IN OTHER QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE
THAT IMPUDENT FELLOW GRUNDLE HAS BEEN WITH ME HE CONTINUED AND WISHES TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT HE CAN GET RID OF ME IN ONE YEAR
BUT HE IS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS JUST AT PRESENT TO SEE HOW CRASWELLER BEARS IT WHAT HAS ALL THAT TO DO WITH EVA'S MARRIAGE I SUPPOSE I MIGHT MARRY HER
ALL LANGUAGES ARE THE SAME TO HER
I WENT HOME AND ON ENTERING THE HOUSE THE FIRST PERSON THAT I SAW WAS EVA
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT WOULD BE A LONG TASK AND ONE NOT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE YOUR BEDTIME WERE I TO RECOUNT TO YOU FOR HIS ADVANTAGE A FEW OF THE ARGUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN FAVOUR OF THE FIXED PERIOD,--AND IT WOULD BE USELESS AS YOU ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
I LOOKED ROUND AND SAW THE BEAUTY OF THE SCENERY AND THOUGHT HOW MUCH WORSE TO SUCH A MAN WOULD BE THE MELANCHOLY SHADES OF THE COLLEGE THAN EVEN DEPARTURE ITSELF
AND IT SEEMED TO ME TO DEPEND NOW ENTIRELY ON THE POWER WHICH I MIGHT EXERT IN CREATING COURAGE IN THE HEART OF THE POOR TIMID CREATURE WHO SAT BEFORE ME
BUT THAT JACK'S PARTY DISREGARDED ALTOGETHER
YOUNG GRABBE WAS VERY POPULAR BECAUSE HE WAS SO ALTOGETHER UNLIKE HIS PARTNER GRUNDLE
DID I NOT EVEN LOVE HIM THE BETTER FOR SWEARING THAT HE WOULD MAKE THIS FIGHT FOR CRASWELLER
IT IS FOR THE GOOD OF MANY THAT I ACT HE BELIEVES IN NO GOOD BUT IS WILLING TO GO BECAUSE OF HIS PROMISE
BUT I THINK THAT I DID RIGHT
MY FELLOW-CITIZENS I SAID A SUDDEN END HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THAT SELF-GOVERNMENT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PROUD AND BY WHICH SIR FERDINANDO HAS TOLD YOU THAT IGNORANCE HAS BEEN EXPELLED FROM YOUR SHORES AND POVERTY HAS BEEN FORCED TO HIDE HER DIMINISHED HEAD I TRUST THAT UNDER HIS EXPERIENCE WHICH HE TELLS US AS A GOVERNOR HAS BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE THOSE EVILS MAY NOT NOW FALL UPON YOU
AND THAT IF THE FIXED PERIOD BE NOT ABANDONED ALTOGETHER WITH A CLEAR CONVICTION AS TO ITS CRUELTY ON THE PART OF THE INHABITANTS GENERALLY YOU SHOULD CAUSE HIM TO BE CARRIED AWAY AND BROUGHT TO ENGLAND
NOT ONE OF THEM HAD AS YET BEEN INHABITED
GUNBOAT THE JOHN BRIGHT HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED TO CARRY YOU OUT
CHAPTER IV
YOU PUT IT ALL ON A YEAR TOO FAR
AND A HUGE GUN WAS LET OFF
I AM SURE WE ARE ALL DELIGHTED TO HEAR THE LADIES SPEAK IN SO PLEASANT A MANNER SAID FIRST-LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES AN OFFICER WITH WHOM I HAVE SINCE BECOME PARTICULARLY INTIMATE
THE MAN WOULD KNOW THAT THE FATED DAY WAS COMING AND WOULD PREPARE FOR IT WITH INFINITELY LESS OF THE ANXIOUS PAIN OF UNCERTAINTY THAN IN THE OUTER WORLD
THEY HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT JACK'S SPEECH IN THE MARKET-PLACE
I CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PROUD HE REPLIED BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SO AWFULLY LICKED
SIR KENNINGTON OVAL WAS OUT,--OUT AT THE VERY FIRST BALL
THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD TO JUSTIFY SO STRANGE A MEASURE I NEED NOT HERE EXPLAIN AT LENGTH
HAD THE TELEGRAPH BEEN INVENTED IN THE DAYS OF ANCIENT ROME WOULD THE ROMANS HAVE ACCEPTED IT OR HAVE STONED WHEATSTONE
AND THEN DURING THAT MOMENT THERE CAME TO ME SUDDENLY AN IDEA THAT IT MIGHT BE WELL THAT I SHOULD TAKE THIS JOURNEY TO ENGLAND AND THERE BEGIN AGAIN MY CAREER,--AS COLUMBUS AFTER VARIOUS OBSTRUCTIONS HAD RECOMMENCED HIS,--AND THAT I SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO CARRY WITH ME THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN AS I HAD ALREADY CARRIED THE MORE QUICKLY INTELLIGENT INHABITANTS OF BRITANNULA
AND YET IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT THIS SUDDEN DEPORTATION WAS NOT NECESSARY
ON THE BROW OF THE HILL WE MET A CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE BOTH YOUNG AND OLD AND I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE LATTER HAD COME OUT TO GREET US
I BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER MY MIND WOULD HOLD ITS PROPER BENT UNDER THE STRAIN THUS LAID UPON IT AND TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER I WAS IN ALL RESPECTS SANE IN ENTERTAINING THE IDEAS WHICH FILLED MY MIND
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED AS I DID TO OBLIGE A FRIEND IN SUCH A MATTER I KNOW IT--I KNOW IT BUT LIFE UNDER SUCH A WEIGHT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO ME
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SAID HE ANXIOUS TO REPRESENT HIS WISHES TO ME IN ANOTHER LIGHT
THIS WAS THOUGHT TO BE VERY SHABBY ON HIS PART THOUGH IF SUCH WAS THE BETTING I DON'T SEE WHY HE SHOULD LOSE HIS MONEY BY BACKING HIS FRIENDS
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--IT IS NOT TOO LATE YET
BUT HERE THE GENTLEMAN ROSE WITH A RAPIDITY WHICH DID AT THE MOMENT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PREMEDITATED
I HEARD THAT THE ENGLISHMEN WERE NOT TO GO TILL ANOTHER WEEK HAD ELAPSED
ON THE SECOND DAY OF OUR PARTY'S SECOND INNINGS,--THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MATCH,--JACK WENT IN
POOR MR CRASWELLER WHOM YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR FORTY YEARS
YOU GAVE MORE ATTENTION TO THE BURNING OF THESE PIGS THAN TO THE COOKING OF ANY FOOD IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN WELL MY DEAR I'M GOING TO ENGLAND NOW SAID I BEGINNING TO FEEL WEARY OF HER REMINISCENCES
SO STRONG ARE THE WEAKNESSES OF THE WORLD THAT PREJUDICE CAN ALWAYS VANQUISH TRUTH BY THE MERE STRENGTH OF ITS BATTALIONS
THE SHRUBS SEEM TO GROW VERY WELL I SAID RESOLVED TO APPEAR AS CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE
AND ALL THE TIME I ENDEAVOURED TO SPY HOW IT WAS THAT HE WORE IT
BUT THAT PERIOD HAD BEEN CHOSEN WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO GET OVER IT I SAID
HE WAS A SMALL FAIR-HAIRED MAN WITH A PALLID FACE AND A BRIGHT EYE WHOSE IDIOSYNCRASY IT WAS TO CONCEIVE THAT LIFE AFLOAT WAS INFINITELY SUPERIOR IN ALL ITS ATTRIBUTES TO LIFE ON SHORE
I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HOW VERY LITTLE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO DO WITH HIS OFFICERS
BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL ASK HIM A QUESTION THEN HE PUT A MINUTE WHISTLE UP TO HIS MOUTH AND I COULD SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE HUNG FROM THIS THE THINNEST POSSIBLE METAL WIRE,--A THREAD OF SILK I WOULD HAVE SAID ONLY THAT IT WAS MUCH LESS PALPABLE,--WHICH HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM THE WHISTLE AS THE LIEUTENANT HAD COME ALONG AND WHICH NOW COMMUNICATED WITH THE VESSEL
IT DID NOT BECOME ME TO SAY A WORD BUT I DID THINK THAT HE WAS VERY HANDSOME;--AND I THOUGHT ALSO HOW UNCOMMONLY HARD IT WOULD BE TO HOLD HIM IF HE SHOULD CHANCE TO WIN THE GAME
BUT TO ME AND CRASWELLER IT WAS ALTOGETHER NEW
AND YET EVEN ME YOU DROVE TO BE A LIAR
OUR RESOLUTION WAS VERY POPULAR NOT ONLY WITH CERTAIN PARTIES IN NEW ZEALAND BUT ALSO IN THE MOTHER COUNTRY
IF ANYTHING COULD DO IT THAT WOULD IN MY OPINION CONTINUED EVA BRITANNULA WILL NEVER BE BEATEN AS LONG AS MR NEVERBEND IS AT THE WICKET SIR KENNINGTON HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR US I FEAR SAID JACK WITH A FORCED SMILE AS HE RETIRED
IT MIGHT BE VERY WELL IF YOU COULD ARRANGE THAT A MAN SHOULD BE DEPOSITED AS SOON AS HE BECOMES ABSOLUTELY INFIRM SOME MEN ARE INFIRM AT FORTY THEN DEPOSIT THEM SAID CRASWELLER
JACK IS A GOOD LAD TOO
THE STREAMS WHICH WATERED THE LAND WERE BRIGHT AND RAPID AND ALWAYS RUNNING
BUT MR NEVERBEND MUST YOU REALLY GO I THINK SO
HE ASSURED ME THAT THE PRECISION WITH WHICH JACK SET HIS STEAM-BOWLER WAS EQUAL TO THAT OF ONE OF THOSE SHOEBURYNESS GUNNERS WHO CAN HIT A SPARROW AS FAR AS THEY CAN SEE HIM ON CONDITION ONLY THAT THEY KNOW THE PRECISE AGE OF THE BIRD
BUT TO BE THE FIRST THAT EVER IT HAPPENED TO IN ALL THE WORLD
ON THE EVENING BEFORE AS I WAS SITTING IN MY LIBRARY AT HOME MOURNFULLY THINKING OF THE OCCASION TELLING MYSELF THAT AFTER ALL I COULD NOT DEVOTE MY FRIEND TO WHAT SOME MIGHT THINK A PREMATURE DEATH THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND EVA CRASWELLER WAS ANNOUNCED
BUT I DO NOT CONGRATULATE THE WORLD ON THE EXTREME FOLLY WHICH STILL GUIDES ITS ACTIONS THEN I LEFT HIM AND GOING INTO THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS SAT MYSELF DOWN AND CRIED IN THE VERY AGONY OF A BROKEN HEART
AND I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THAT WHEN I RETURN TO BRITANNULA I SHALL FIND HIM LIVING IN GREAT COMFORT AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
BUT TO HAVE GONE UP INTO THAT FRIGHTFUL COLLEGE AND THERE TO HAVE REMAINED THROUGH THAT YEAR WHICH WOULD HAVE WASTED ITSELF SO SLOWLY AND YET SO FAST,--THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A HEROISM WHICH AS I THINK NO GREEK NO ROMAN NO ENGLISHMAN EVER POSSESSED THEN HE PAUSED AND I WAS AWARE THAT I HAD OVERSTAYED MY TIME
SINCE THEY CAME UP NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN LOST AMONG THE GLACIERS YOU HAD BETTER PREPARE THEN TO GO SAID I THINKING THAT THE IDEA OF GETTING RID OF JACK IN THIS MANNER WAS VERY HAPPY
HE WAS TEN YEARS MY SENIOR THEN AND IS NOW THEREFORE FIT FOR DEPOSITION IN THE COLLEGE WERE THE COLLEGE THERE TO RECEIVE HIM
WHEN I SAW BOBBS AT WORK OVER HIM I THOUGHT THAT ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE WAS GONE AND THAT HIS EYE WOULD BE DREADFULLY OUT OF PLACE
I SAID THAT I WAS BOUND TO SUPPOSE THAT CRASWELLER WOULD DO HIS DUTY AS A CITIZEN,--BY WHICH I HAD MEANT GRAYBODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT I EXPECTED MY OLD FRIEND TO SUBMIT TO DEPOSITION
COLUMBUS AND GALILEO
COLUMBUS AND GALILEO
THOUGH IT BE VERY IMPROBABLE,--IMPOSSIBLE AS YOU AND I MAY THINK IT,--THE LAW IS THE SAME FOR HIM AS FOR OTHERS
THROUGHOUT THE SERVICE
THEY HEARD OF THE BILL NO DOUBT
HE HIMSELF WAS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH EVA AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT EVA WAS NEARLY AS FOND OF HIM
WHO IS THE GENTLEMAN IT WAS EASY TO SEE BY MY WIFE'S FACE AND TO KNOW BY HER TONE OF VOICE THAT SHE WAS MUCH DISTURBED BY THE NEWS
A BLESSING I SUPPOSE MEANS SOMETHING OF AN ALLOWANCE PAID QUARTERLY I TURNED AWAY MY FACE THAT HE MIGHT NOT SEE THE SMILE WHICH I FELT WAS INVOLUNTARILY CREEPING ACROSS IT
MAKE THEM DRUNK SO THAT THEY SHALL NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
AND HOW WOULD IT BE IF THE VOLUNTEERS THEMSELVES REFUSED TO ACT ON THE SIDE OF LAW AND ORDER
BUT WE NEED NOT DISCUSS ALL THIS NOW
I ADMITTED SO MUCH TO MYSELF WITH THE FULL UNDERSTANDING THAT A THEORY DELAYED SO LONG MUST BE ENDANGERED BY ITS OWN POSTPONEMENT
TO THESE ARE TO BE ADDED ALL WHO BECAUSE OF ILLNESS CANNOT WORK AND BECAUSE OF IDLENESS WILL NOT
THE CRICKET-MATCH SPRANG TO THE FRONT SO SUDDENLY THAT JACK SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL HIS ENERGY RESPECTING THE COLLEGE AND TO HAVE TRANSFERRED HIS ENTIRE ATTENTION TO THE VARIOUS WEAPONS OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE WHEREWITH THE LONDON CLUB WAS IF POSSIBLE TO BE BEATEN
CAPTAIN BATTLEAX OF THE JOHN BRIGHT WILL HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER TO THE SAME EFFECT FROM THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY AND YOU WILL FIND HIM READY TO CO-OPERATE WITH YOUR EXCELLENCY IN EVERY RESPECT.--I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE SIR YOUR EXCELLENCY'S MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT HATFIELD
AND OF COURSE IF HE IS LET OFF YOU MUST LET OFF BARNES AND TALLOWAX
THEN WHEN THE SHOUTING AND THE HOLLOAING AND THE FLINGING UP OF THE BALL WERE STILL GOING ON I REMEMBERED THAT AFTER IT HE WOULD HAVE HIS CONSOLATION WITH EVA
THEN HE DEPARTED TAKING JACK WITH HIM LEANING ON WHOSE ARM HE STEPPED DOWN INTO THE BOAT
BUT I HAD NOT IN THE LEAST SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HIM SEE THE GOOD WHICH WOULD COME FROM HIS DEPOSITION
HOW PERSUADE SUCH MEN AS BARNES OR TALLOWAX OR THAT PETTIFOGGER EXORS TO BE LED QUIETLY UP THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY
IT WOULD BE UNSEEMLY
SOME HAD DEMANDED THAT CEDARS AND YEW-TREES SHOULD BE PLACED THERE AND I HAD BEEN AT GREAT PAINS TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT OUR OBJECT SHOULD BE TO MAKE THE SPOT CHEERFUL RATHER THAN SAD
SIR KENNINGTON DID NOT FLY BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS HE WAS VERY LIKE THE GODDESS SO COMPLETELY ENVELOPED WAS HE IN HIS INDIA-RUBBER GUARDS AND SO WONDERFUL WAS THE MACHINE UPON HIS HEAD BY WHICH HIS BRAIN AND FEATURES WERE TO BE PROTECTED
MY WIFE'S OPPOSITION HAD BEEN AN ANNOYANCE TO ME FROM THE FIRST BUT I HAD CONSOLED MYSELF BY THINKING HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT ALWAYS IS TO IMBUE A WOMAN'S MIND WITH A LOGICAL IDEA
WHAT IS YOUR DECISION I COULD ONLY REMAIN STEADFAST
CIRCUMSTANCES AS I SHALL RELATE IN THIS STORY HAVE SOMEWHAT INTERFERED WITH HIM
AND I HAD BEEN ABLE BY THE INTENSITY OF MY WILL,--AND SOMETHING TOO BY THE COVETOUSNESS AND HURRY OF THE YOUNGER MEN,--TO CAUSE MY WISHES TO PREVAIL IN THE COMMUNITY
THIS LATTER PROPOSITION WAS ACCEPTED AT ONCE AND THE EXEMPT SHOWED NO REPUGNANCE EVEN WHEN IT WAS PROVED TO THEM THAT THEY WOULD BE LEFT ALONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ENTITLED TO NO HONOUR AND NEVER ALLOWED EVEN TO ENTER THE PLEASANT GARDENS OF THE COLLEGE
AND EVEN HAD I SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING MY SUCCESS SO FAR AS THAT SHOULD I NOT HAVE APPEARED A MURDERER TO MY FELLOW-CITIZENS HAD NOT HIS DEPARTURE BEEN FOLLOWED IN REGULAR SEQUENCE BY THAT OF ALL OTHERS TILL IT HAD COME TO MY TURN
BUT NOT,--WHEN I CAME TO ARGUE THE MATTER WITH MYSELF,--THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF WAS AT FAULT
EVERY DAY YOU HAVE BEEN AT THESE NASTY EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS FROM NINE TILL FIVE UNLESS WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SITTING IN THAT WRETCHED ASSEMBLY I SHALL HAVE A HOLIDAY NOW AT ANY RATE SAID I LAUGHING GENTLY UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES
AND I COULD SEE THAT THE YOUNG ORATOR'S BROW WAS STILL FLUSHED WITH THE TRIUMPH OF THE MOMENT
BUT I DO CONFESS THAT I DOUBT WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROCEED TO CARRY OUT THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF CRASWELLER
THEY DO IT ON PURPOSE TO PUT HIM OFF HIS PLAY SAID HIS MOTHER
IT WAS TWO HOURS BEFORE JACK HAD SORELY LAMED HIM IN THE HIP AND THE UMPIRE HAD GIVEN IT LEG-BEFORE-WICKET
AND THEN IN ENGLAND I COULD DO MORE FOR THE FIXED PERIOD THAN AT HOME IN BRITANNULA
THE 250-TON SWIVELLER NO DOUBT WAS UNANSWERABLE--UNLESS WE WERE PREPARED TO DIE FOR OUR SYSTEM
WHY HE'S THIRTY AND HAS BEEN EATING SOUP THEY TELL ME ALL THROUGH THE JOURNEY THESE YOUNG MEN HAD BROUGHT A DOCTOR WITH THEM DR MACNUFFERY TO PRESCRIBE TO THEM WHAT TO EAT AND DRINK AT EACH MEAL
DID YOU REALLY MEAN TO KILL THE OLD MEN SAID LORD ALFRED PERCY TO ME ONE DAY
AND AS SUCH IT WOULD BECOME ME TO HIDE MY HEAD
PETER GRUNDLE FOR INSTANCE CRASWELLER'S SENIOR PARTNER HAD BEEN HEARD TO SAY THAT ENGLAND WOULD NOT ALLOW A DEPOSITED MAN TO BE SLAUGHTERED
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT HER OPINION WILL BE ALLOWED TO INTERRUPT THE LAWS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AND OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF CIVILISATION HER FEELINGS WILL SAID RUGGLES
HE POINTED TO THE GUNBOAT IN THE BAY WHEN IT CAME AND CALLED IT THE DIVINE DEPOSITORY OF BENEFICENT POWER
BUNNIT AND THE BAR-KEEPER TOOK OUT THE HORSES AND PROCEEDED TO LEAD THEM DOWN THE HILL
IT WAS THE STATE OF HER FEELINGS RATHER THAT WOULD PUSH ITSELF INTO MY MIND
BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE THING TO BE ACTED THE PLAY TO BE PLAYED BY ME THE PLAYER
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY ASKING YOU BECAUSE LITTLE AS MY ACQUAINTANCE IS WITH YOU IT IS WITH YOU ALONE OF ALL ENGLISHMEN THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE INTENT ABOUT YOUR BOOK WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MY BOOK
BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA OF INVADING YOUR PARLIAMENT AND FORCING OUR LAWS UPON YOU TAKE A GLASS OF WINE MR PRESIDENT SAID LORD MARYLEBONE AND LEAVE PUDDLEBRANE TO HIS ANCESTORS
THE PARLIAMENT IN ENGLAND WHICH IS I TAKE IT QUITE AS MAJESTIC AS THE ASSEMBLY IN BRITANNULA I APOLOGISE FOR THE WORD MR CROSSTREES WHICH SAVOURS OF THE RIDICULOUS
A HAPPIER OLD GENTLEMAN OR ONE MORE ACTIVE FOR HIS YEARS I HAD NEVER KNOWN
I DOUBT WHETHER CAESAR WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THOSE ENEMIES AROUND HIM,--GAULS AND BRITONS AND ROMANS
THEY HAD ONLY MADE 150 RUNS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND THREE WICKETS WERE DOWN
IF SO YOU MUST BE CONTENT TO TAKE MY DEAD BODY
IN SPITE OF JACK'S GOOD PLAY AND THE SUCCESS ON THE PART OF MY OWN COUNTRYMEN I COULD NOT BUT BE SORRY TO THINK THAT THE YOUNG BARONET HAD COME HALF ROUND THE WORLD TO BE PUT OUT AT THE FIRST BALL
AS I THOUGHT OF ALL WALKING DOWN THE STREET HANGING ON JACK'S ARM I HAD TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER THE FIXED PERIOD WAS THE CHERISHED CONVICTION OF OUR HEARTS
I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFOREHAND THAT A MAN OF SUCH SENTIMENTS AND FEELINGS WAS NOT AT ALL TO MY TASTE
BUT THOUGH THAT IS SO SAID SIR FERDINANDO A LITTLE NETTLED AT THE WANT OF ADMIRATION WITH WHICH HIS WORDS HAD BEEN RECEIVED H.M
THERE MIGHT BE A WRIT YOU KNOW NE EXEANT REGNO
I HAD HOPED THAT A SMILING HAMLET MIGHT GROW UP AT THE GATE INHABITED BY THOSE WHO WOULD ADMINISTER TO THE WANTS OF THE DEPOSITED
MR SECOND LIEUTENANT I MUST HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INTERRUPTION SAID I
IT IS ALL VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT SUCH A ONE WOULD SAY IF STILL BRAVE AND STILL DESIROUS OF HONOUR
BUT IN TRUTH THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH LAY IN OUR WAY WERE VERY STERN
SHE WAS,--AND IS,--A BRAVE GOOD WOMAN ATTACHED TO HER HOUSEHOLD DUTIES ANXIOUS FOR HER HUSBAND'S COMFORT BUT BEYOND MEASURE SOLICITOUS FOR ALL GOOD THINGS TO BEFALL THAT SCAPEGRACE JACK NEVERBEND FOR WHOM SHE THINKS THAT NOTHING IS SUFFICIENTLY RICH OR SUFFICIENTLY GRAND
BUT I CANNOT LOOK WITH SATISFACTION TO A CONDITION OF LIFE IN WHICH FROM MY OWN IMBECILITY I MUST NECESSARILY RETROGRADE INTO SELFISHNESS
LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE QUESTION WITH THE EYES OF REASON I COULD NOT BUT TELL MYSELF THAT A BETTER EXAMPLE OF A TRIUMPHANT BEGINNING TO OUR SYSTEM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND
I WOULD AGAIN ATTEMPT TO DO SO WITH A BRITISH AUDIENCE
EVERYTHING THAT HE LOVED I HAVE ALWAYS HATED AND ALL THAT HE DESPISED I HAVE REVERED
IF IT ONCE GOT AHEAD WE SHOULD BE NO BETTER OFF THAN THE AUSTRALIANS THIS MIGHT BE ANXIETY FOR HIS DAUGHTER
BUT NOW THAT PROMISE,--ONCE SO PAINFULLY MADE AND SINCE THAT AS I HAD THOUGHT FORGOTTEN BY ALL BUT MYSELF,--WAS REMEMBERED AGAINST ME AS A PROOF OF THE DIABOLICAL INHUMANITY OF MY DISPOSITION
THOUGH THE PEOPLE MIGHT BE AGAINST ME AND REGARD ME AS THEIR ENEMY,--THAT PEOPLE FOR WHOSE WELFARE I HAD DONE IT ALL,--STILL I WOULD PERSEVERE EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT BE DESTINED TO FALL IN THE ATTEMPT
AND THEN TO BE TOLD IN THIS MANNER THAT JACK DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF EVA AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED IN PREFERENCE TO LOOK AFTER THE SHEEP
AND THERE WERE CLAUSES IN THE LAW WHICH WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO PROVE THE VALIDITY OF THE CONTRACT
IT WAS VERY ODD THAT THOSE FELLOWS SHOULD HAVE TURNED UP JUST AT THIS MOMENT SAID JACK
A RUMOUR WAS SPREAD ABROAD THAT THE TWELVE MONTHS OF CRASWELLER'S PERIOD OF PROBATION WERE TO BE DEVOTED TO DISCUSSING THE QUESTION AND I WAS TOLD THAT MY THEORY AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD WOULD NOT IN TRUTH HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT MERELY BECAUSE MR CRASWELLER HAD CHANGED HIS RESIDENCE FROM LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH TO THE COLLEGE
EVA AND LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH WITH JACK'S FEELINGS AND INTERESTS AND ALL MY WIFE'S LONGINGS MUST BE LAID ON ONE SIDE AND MY WHOLE ENERGY MUST BE DEVOTED TO THE LITERAL CARRYING OUT OF THE LAW
BUT NOW AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I HAD HARDLY TIME FOR MEDITATION
AND HAD SO FAR MADE UP HIS MIND BEFORE HE WENT AS TO ASK EVA TO MARRY HIM OUT OF HAND AND RETURN WITH HIM TO ENGLAND
WITH A GLASS HE REPLIED BY WHICH HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHETHER YOU LEAVE THE BUILDING
YOU AND I CRASWELLER HAVE HAD OUR LITTLE TROUBLES TO IMBITTER THE EVENINGS OF OUR LIFE YOU ARE YET IN THE FULL DAYLIGHT MY AMBITION HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED
AND THE END WILL BE THAT HE WILL GET EVA FOR HIS OWN
BUT MY DEAR I BEGAN DETERMINED TO TEACH HER THE WHOLE THEORY OF THE FIXED PERIOD WITH ALL ITS ADVANTAGES FROM FIRST TO LAST
BUT I THINK THAT HE MUST BE MISTAKEN HERE AS HE HAS NOT VENTURED TO ATTACK ONE OF THEM
HE DREADS HIS DEPARTURE WITH A TREMBLING CURRISH FEAR
AND NOW I AM TO BE SENT BACK IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT ATTEND TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HOT MASHES
HERE THE BATTLE WAS OVER AND I HAD BEEN BEATEN
HERE WAS THAT POOR CRASWELLER BELYING HIMSELF AND ALL HIS CONVICTIONS JUST TO GAIN ONE YEAR MORE OF IT AND THEN WHEN THE YEAR WAS GONE HE WOULD STILL HAVE HIS DEPOSITION BEFORE HIM
HOW MUCH OF EVIL,--OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL,--HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
NO GREATER INSTANCE OF UNCALLED-FOR TYRANNY IS TOLD OF IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AS ALREADY WRITTEN
VOLUME I
EVERYTHING THAT HE DID AND ALL THAT HE SAID WERE MERELY THE EFFLUX OF HIS HIGH SPIRITS AS A SCHOOLBOY
IF I COULD IN THE SPIRIT HAVE LEAPED OVER A SPACE OF THIRTY YEARS AND BEEN MYSELF DEPOSITED IN DUE ORDER I COULD SEE THAT MY MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBALMED WITH THOSE WHO HAD DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS
THEN ONE IS DRIVEN BACK TO CONSIDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH SUCH CHANGE MAY BE EFFECTED
DO YOU THINK THAT JACK COULD BE BROUGHT TO LEND AN EAR TO IT PERISH JACK
MACNUFFERY WAS THE MOST DISAGREEABLE MAN OF THE ENGLISH PARTY AND SOON BEGAN TO TURN UP HIS NOSE AT BOBBS
MRS G
WE SHALL HAVE THE FLUKE OVER HERE IF WE DON'T LOOK AFTER OURSELVES HAVE YOU FOUND SYMPTOMS OF IT WELL
WE'RE GONE COONS
UNDER MY AUSPICES HE HAD ALWAYS VOTED FOR THE FIXED PERIOD AND HE COULD HARDLY OPPOSE IT NOW IN THEORY
AND NOW GOOD-BYE MY DARLING CHILD
CHAPTER VII
WHEN THESE MEETINGS FIRST BEGAN EVA STILL ACKNOWLEDGED HERSELF TO BE THE PROMISED BRIDE OF ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
BUT WE PARTED AS FRIENDS AND SOON AFTER WENT TO DINNER
EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE THERE DONE FOR YOUR ACCOMMODATION AND COMFORT,--EVERY LUXURY WHICH CAN BE PROVIDED TO SOLACE THE PRESIDENT OF THIS LATE REPUBLIC,--SHALL BE AFFORDED
IT WAS A GREAT WORLD'S MOVEMENT THAT HAD BEEN PROJECTED AND IF IT WERE TO FAIL NOW JUST AT ITS COMMENCEMENT WHEN EVERYTHING HAD BEEN ARRANGED FOR THE WORK WHEN AGAIN WOULD THERE BE HOPE
BUT JACK WHO DID NOT AS FAR AS I COULD SEE CARE A STRAW FOR HUMANITY IN THE MATTER HAD VEHEMENTLY TAKEN THE SIDE OF THE ANTI-FIXED-PERIODISTS AS THE SAFEST WAY TO GET THE FATHER'S CONSENT
AS AN ALTERATION OF OUR CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH OUR CONDITION MAY BE IMMEASURABLY IMPROVED
BUT JACK WAS PLAYING AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WITH HIS FACE STRAPPED UP ATHWART AND ACROSS WITH REPUBLICAN BLACK-SILK ADHESIVE
WE ARE NOT SURE OF THAT SAID SIR FERDINANDO
OUR NEXT MAN WAS BETTER THAN THEIRS THEY SAID AND THEY WERE ANXIOUS THAT WE SHOULD TAKE OUR SECOND BEST TO WHICH OUR MEN WOULD NOT AGREE
IF I COULD NOT BE STRONG TO PREVAIL WITH MY OWN FRIEND AND FELLOW-LABOURER,--WITH CRASWELLER WHO WAS THE FIRST TO COME AND WHO SHOULD HAVE ENTERED THE COLLEGE WITH AN HEROIC GRANDEUR,--HOW COULD I EVEN DESIRE ANY OTHER TO IMMURE HIMSELF
EVA I RARELY SAW
I HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE AT MY WORK FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS
I HAVE FIFTY YOUNG FOALS IN THAT MEADOW THERE
CHAPTER XII
I'VE GOT TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING MYSELF
HE WAS READY TO BECOME A MARTYR BECAUSE IN YEARS BACK HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO SO
HE WAS NEARLY THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND WAS REGARDED BY THEM ALL AS QUITE AN OLD MAN
NEED I EXPLAIN TO THE INHABITANTS OF ENGLAND FOR WHOM I CHIEFLY WRITE HOW EXTREME ARE THOSE SUFFERINGS AND HOW GREAT THE COSTLINESS OF THAT OLD AGE WHICH IS UNABLE IN ANY DEGREE TO SUPPLY ITS OWN WANTS
HE WAS DRESSED IN SIMPLE BLACK AND WAS CLEARLY NOT ONE OF THE SHIP'S OFFICERS
YOU ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY FREED OURSELVES FROM THE STAIN OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THOSE COINS PASS IN YOUR MARKET-PLACES THEN HE BROUGHT OUT A GOLD PIECE FROM HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET AND SLAPPED IT DOWN ON THE TABLE
AND THE SMOKE WILL ALL CONSUME ITSELF SO THAT EVEN YOU LIVING JUST WHERE YOU ARE WILL NOT KNOW WHEN CREMATION IS GOING ON
SOME OF THESE WERE VERY HANDSOME AND WERE MADE SO NO DOUBT WITH A VIEW OF ALLURING THE FIRST COMERS
AT THIS I OWN I WAS ASTONISHED
SHE KNOWS HOW TO DO GOOD AND WHEN TO DO IT
THE BOAT SAILS AT EIGHT
I DID NOT GO OF COURSE NOR DID I THINK IT WELL TO READ THE REPORTS
JACK I FANCY THOUGHT MORE OF EVA'S SILENCE THAN OF HIS MOTHER'S PRAYER
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT IN THOSE DAYS AS FAR AS THE ROMANS KNEW THE EVERLASTING HAD NOT FIXED HIS CANON GAINST SELF-SLAUGHTER I MUST REACH HIM BY OTHER METHODS THAN THESE IF AT ALL
IS IT NOT FOR YOU AND ME TO RAISE HIM TO A HIGHER LEVEL NOT FOR ME--NOT FOR ME CERTAINLY
YOU WILL PERCEIVE CAPTAIN BATTLEAX THAT THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN US ALL HERE AS TO THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THIS MORNING
THEY HAVEN'T TRIED
AND I DO THINK THAT FOR AN EARNEST SPIRIT ABOUT A THING JACK IS A VERY FINE FELLOW ABRAHAM GRUNDLE YOU KNOW IS JUST AS WARM ON THE OTHER SIDE I HATE ABRAHAM GRUNDLE
OUR LANGUAGE IS SPREADING ITSELF OVER THE WORLD AND IS NO SIGN OF NATIONALITY WHAT LAWS DO YOU OBEY ENGLISH,--TILL WE CHOOSE TO REPEAL THEM
BUT IN MY HEART I COULD FORGIVE CRASWELLER
I THE FATHER HAVE TO SUBMIT TO YOU THE SON
AN ENGLISHMAN WOULD HESITATE TO FIRE A SHOT THAT WOULD SEND PERHAPS FIVE THOUSAND OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES TO DESTRUCTION BEFORE THEIR FIXED PERIOD
AND IN ORDER THAT I MAY DO SO I HAVE NOW PREPARED THESE PAGES WRITING THEM ON BOARD H.M
OH MR PRESIDENT HE SAID AS HE MET ME COMING UP THE DRIVE TOWARDS THE HOUSE THIS IS KIND OF YOU
SHE SAYS THAT NO GOOD CHRISTIANS EVER THOUGHT OF IT A CHILD--A SWEET CHILD--BUT STILL ONLY A CHILD
I DID THINK OF IT
BUT ENGLAND AT FIRST DID NOT BELIEVE US
I THE PRESIDENT OF FIFTY-SEVEN TO YOU THE SCHOOLBOY OF TWENTY-ONE
I WAS HOWEVER QUITE AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO SPEND MY ENERGY IN DILATING ON THIS TO MR GRAYBODY
UP THEY CAME AND WERE RECEIVED WITH THREE DEAFENING CHEERS BY THE CROWD IMMEDIATELY ROUND THE CARRIAGE
AND A CREMATED MAN MAY HAVE AS BIG A TOMBSTONE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO BECOME ROTTEN IN THE ORTHODOX FASHION WHAT PUDDLEBRANE MEANS IS SAID ANOTHER THAT HE'D LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME CHANCE OF LIVING AS HIS ANCESTORS IF HE WILL LOOK BACK TO HIS FAMILY RECORDS HE WILL FIND THAT THEY VERY GENERALLY DIED BEFORE SIXTY-EIGHT
IT MUST BE THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES CRUDE COUNCILS SHOULD BE PASSED AS LAWS WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARD COMING FROM FURTHER DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT
WE MIGHT CONSUME ALL GLADSTONOPOLIS AS I HOPE WE SHALL SOME DAY AND NOT A LIVING SOUL WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
LET THE READER THINK OF THE BURDEN WITH WHICH THE LABOUR OF THE WORLD IS THUS SADDLED
THERE WAS THE CROWD OF ENGLISHMEN ALL GOING OFF TO THE VESSEL TO SEE THEIR BATS AND BICYCLES DISPOSED OF AND AMONG THEM WAS JACK THE HERO
WILL NEVER BE OPEN FOR ME,--AND I WAS NEARLY THIRTY WHEN I BEGAN TO BE IN EARNEST AS TO THE FIXED PERIOD
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
HAD I A RIGHT TO HOPE TO ALTER THE FEELINGS WHICH NATURE HERSELF HAD IMPLANTED IN THE MINDS OF MEN
IT IS CONTEMPLATED TO DESTROY ALL THOSE WHO SHALL HAVE REACHED A CERTAIN FIXED AGE
BUT I COULD SEE NOW THAT EVA HAD MERELY PLAYED HIM OFF AGAINST JACK THINKING THEREBY TO INDUCE THE YOUNGER SWAIN TO SPEAK HIS MIND
HE ONLY FELT THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GIVE UP
TWO MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE BY MANKIND IN REFERENCE TO THEIR OWN RACE,--FIRST IN ALLOWING THE WORLD TO BE BURDENED WITH THE CONTINUED MAINTENANCE OF THOSE WHOSE CARES SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO CEASE AND WHOSE TROUBLES SHOULD BE AT AN END
ARE YOU THE PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC I AM REPLIED I
SIR YES SAID HE
III
ALL THE EXISTING IDEAS OF THE GRAVE WOULD BE ABSENT
A MAN WHO SO SPOKE COULD HAVE KNOWN NOTHING OF THE GENERAL BEAUTY OF THE FIXED PERIOD
JACK IS TO BE RUINED SHE HAD SAID IN ORDER THAT ALL THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN MAY BE KILLED ARTISTICALLY THIS AND OTHER REMARKS OF THE KIND I WAS DOOMED TO BEAR
I CAN CONCEIVE WITH RAPTURE THE PRIDE THE HONOUR THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH WHEN THE FIXED PERIOD HAD COME I COULD HAVE LED MY FATHER INTO THE COLLEGE THERE TO ENJOY FOR TWELVE MONTHS THAT PREPARATION FOR EUTHANASIA WHICH NO CARES FOR THIS WORLD WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DISTURB
I ALMOST DOUBTED MY OWN ENERGY AS A TEACHER OF PROGRESS TO CARRY ME THROUGH THE MISERY WHICH I SAW IN STORE FOR ME
IT MIGHT WELL BE THAT THESE ACCUSATIONS OF CRUELTY WERE A PART OF THE SUFFERING WITHOUT WHICH MY GREAT REFORM COULD NOT BE CARRIED TO SUCCESS
THEN WE BEGAN TO THINK OF THE HOSPITALITY OF THE ISLAND AND THE OFFICERS OF THE JOHN BRIGHT WERE ASKED TO DINE WITH US ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
EXACTLY SO
EXACTLY SO
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEVENTY THAT HAS ALL BEEN DISCUSSED FULLY AND YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR ASSENT
BUT AT ANY RATE IN THIS MATTER OF MR CRASWELLER YOU HAVE GOT THE BETTER OF ME THAT WAS FOR EVA'S SAKE I SUPPOSE SO
THE FACT THAT DEATH MUST COME AT THE SETTLED DAY WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE ITS HORROR AS LONG AS THE MAN WERE ABLE HABITUALLY TO CONTRAST HIS POSITION WITH THAT OF THE FEW FAVOURED ONES WHO HAD WITHIN HIS OWN MEMORY LIVED HAPPILY TO A MORE ADVANCED AGE
IT IS SWEET AT THE MOMENT
IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT I SAID TO MYSELF AS SOON AS THESE ENGLISHMEN HAVE LEFT THE ISLAND BUT THEN MY MIND REVERTED TO THE FIXED PERIOD AND TO THE FAST-APPROACHING TIME FOR CRASWELLER'S DEPOSITION
CRASWELLER WAS A POPULAR MAN IN BRITANNULA AND THE PEOPLE AROUND WOULD NOT BE SO CONVERSANT WITH THE FACT AS WAS I NOR WOULD THEY HAVE THE SAME REASONS TO BE ANXIOUS THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE ACCURATELY FOLLOWED
MR BRITTLEREED NOW WENT TO HIS WICKET AND WAS BOUND TO RECEIVE THE FIRST BALL
WE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO MEASURES IN REGARD TO THEIR PUBLIC DEBT WHICH THE HOUSES IN NEW ZEALAND THREATENED TO TAKE
