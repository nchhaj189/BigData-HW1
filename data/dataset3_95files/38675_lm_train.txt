AND THEN BEING OF AN UNDERSTANDING HEART AND AN EXPERIMENTAL TURN OF MIND HE LAID THE CUB DOWN AND RETURNED TO THE BODY OF THE MOTHER
YELPING WITH TRIUMPH THE EAGLES HAD SWOOPED DOWN AFTER HIM
THE CALF WHICH HAD STOOD WATCHING THE FIGHT IN PETRIFIED AMAZEMENT HAD RECOVERED THE USE OF ITS LEGS WITH A BOUND AT THE SHOCK OF THE REPORT AND SHAMBLED OFF INTO THE WOODS WITH A HOARSE BLEAT OF TERROR
THE GRAY VISITOR TURNED HIS HEAD SLOWLY TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY MORE SUCH INTRUDERS UPON HIS SOLITUDE THEN TRANQUILLY WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
THAT NIGHT HOWEVER HE DISMISSED THE IDEA OF TRAPS FROM HIS MIND AS MAKING TOO MUCH OF THE MATTER
FAR DOWN IN THE SHADOW BENEATH THE WILD RAM'S PEAK A WHITE TENT GLIMMERED BESIDE THE MISTY COILS OF THE STREAM WHICH THREADED THE VALLEY
FROM THIS POINT OF VANTAGE IT SURVEYED THE SITUATION ANEW A LITTLE SPARK OF BLOOD-RED FIRE ALTERNATELY GLOWING AND FADING IN ITS EYES AS ITS KEEN NOSTRILS CAUGHT THE SCENT OF THE FISH
AT THIS POINT THE WISE OLD RAM BEGAN TO GO WARILY
HE BROKE INTO PANIC FLIGHT THROUGH THE BUSHES AND THE HOLLOW PROTESTINGS OF THE CAN KEPT TIME TO THE MADNESS OF HIS GOING
FOR A LITTLE BROWN BULL STOOD IRRESOLUTE HALF INCLINED TO LEAD HIS FOLLOWERS AWAY FROM THE HOST AND SLIP BACK INTO THE WOODED FOOTHILLS WHENCE THEY HAD COME
IN A MOMENT OR TWO HER PIERCING EYES DETECTED THOSE TWO LITTLE LIMP BODIES LYING AWASH ON THE LIP OF GRANITE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL
BUT AS HE DID SO THE CAN NOW QUITE EMPTY AND RESONANT GAVE FORTH A HOLLOW CLATTER
BUT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE FIRST SHARP FROSTS WHEN THE GROUND WAS CRISP WITH THE NEW-FALLEN LEAVES WOOF AND HIS MATE BEGAN TO LOSE INTEREST IN EACH OTHER
BUT AS IT CHANCED WOOF ALSO HAD HEARD FROM A LITTLE FURTHER OFF THAT LOWING OF THE DISCONSOLATE HEIFER
SISSY--BEMBRIDGE--_YOU CRIED THE FOREMOST SPRINGING FROM HIS SADDLELESS MOUNT
WITH A ROAR OF RAGE HE CHARGED DOWN THE KNOLL
BUT HE WAS NOT QUITE QUICK ENOUGH
HE SEEMED TO GROW MORE PUGNACIOUS THAN EVER AT THE SOUND OF THESE MILD EXHORTATIONS
THE COYOTES DANGEROUS ONLY TO THE DYING OR TO VERY YOUNG CALVES SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHERS WERE PRACTICALLY IGNORED SAVE FOR AN OCCASIONAL ANGRY RUSH ON THE PART OF SOME NERVOUS COW
ALL AT ONCE THESE NOISES OF BATTLE STOPPED CHANGED PASSED INTO A CONFUSED SCUFFLING MIXED WITH GROANS AND THEN INTO A WILD CRASHING OF FLIGHT AND PURSUIT
AND THE CUB WHO WAS A ROGUISH BUT AMIABLE SOUL REPAID HER DEVOTION BY IMITATING HER IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE
THE DRAKE UNREALIZING THAT THE DREADFUL CHASE WAS DONE SPED ONWARD BENEATH THE SURFACE TILL HE COULD GO WITHOUT BREATH NO LONGER
JUST BEFORE HIM WAS A DROP OF A COOL THOUSAND FEET
AN I'M A FOOL AN NO MISTAKE THE MYSTERY THUS SATISFACTORILY SOLVED HE SWUNG ON CONTENTEDLY FOR THE NEXT MILE OR SO

THE BEAR BEING BY NATURE A VERY SILENT ANIMAL HER NOISY BARKING SEEMED ALWAYS TO STIR HIS CURIOSITY AND ADMIRATION
BUT BETWEEN THIS BLEAK WIND-HARRIED FRONT AND THE RICH PLAIN COUNTRY BY THE SEA WERE MANY LESSER PINNACLES AND RIDGES WITH DEEP RAVINES BETWEEN ALL CLOTHED WITH DARK SPRUCE WOODS AND TANGLED UNDERGROWTH
TO THE GRAY VISITOR COMING FROM A REGION SO FAR NORTH THAT THERE WERE NO TALL TREETOPS THIS DARK MASS HAD NO SIGNIFICANCE
AS SHE SPRANG HOWEVER HER FOOT CAUGHT IN ONE OF THE PIECES OF STOVE-PIPE
HE KNEW THAT HE COULD KILL HER IF ONCE HE COULD REACH HER THROAT OR GET HIS GRIP FIXED ON ONE OF HER MIGHTY WINGS CLOSE TO THE BASE
THOUGH THE STORM WAS RAGING OVER THE OUTER WORLD TO BLUE FOX IN HIS BURROW HAD COME A MONITION OF EVIL
DO YE WANT TO BE LEFT TO THE B'ARS AND THE H'A'NTS IN THE BIG BLACK WOODS ALL BY YER LONESOME HE DEMANDED
HIS PRIZE HAD BEEN IMPUDENTLY SNATCHED FROM HIS TEETH
FORTUNATELY FOR MCLAGGAN THE GREAT BULL WAS NO MERE BLIND AND BRUTAL RUFFIAN OF A FIGHTER
NOT ONE CARED
IT WAS JABE SMITH'S PROPERTY AND HE GOT A CERTAIN COMFORT FROM LYING BESIDE IT AND GUARDING IT FOR HIS MASTER
AT THE SAME TIME THIS ENTRANCE WAS SO SET THAT INNUMERABLE CHOICE MORSELS FLY AND BEETLE GRUB AND BERRY HAVING BEEN BATTERED DOWN OVER THE FALLS WERE THEN PERSUASIVELY SWEPT INTO IT
WITH A CHOKED SCREAM SHE LEAPT STRAIGHT AT THE DOOR
HALF A DOZEN OF THE FINEST FISH HE TOOK OUT AND STRUNG UPON A FORKED TWIG
THE GIRL MEANWHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER UNCERTAINTY AND FATIGUE WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE APPREHENSIVE
THE WOLF UNDERSTANDING HER TACTICS AND ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE HIM HEADED HER OFF WITHOUT TOO VIOLENTLY EXERTING HIMSELF
BUT THE TRADITIONS HANDED DOWN FROM THE ADVENTURE OF THAT OLD TRAPPER WERE AS STIMULATING TO MACCREEDY'S IMAGINATION AS ANY MYTH OF QUARTZ VEIN OR NUGGET COULD HAVE BEEN
AT THE SAME TIME SHE COULD NOT BE LEFT OUTDOORS AT NIGHT THE NIGHT AIR OF THE WILDERNESS BEING SOMETIMES INFECTED WITH BEARS LYNXES AND WILD-CATS
HE WAS NOT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE MAN BUT NOW DRAWING NEARLY ABREAST OF HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NARROW STEEP OF GRASS
IN THAT LAND OF TRIED WOODSMEN AND DARING STREAM-DRIVERS HE WOULD NOT HAVE GAINED THAT NAME WITHOUT DESERVING IT
AS SHE DID SO SHE SCRATCHED A BUNCH OF FOUR OR FIVE MATCHES AND THREW THEM SPLUTTERING AND HISSING IN THE FACE OF THE APPARITION
IN THE COURSE OF NO LONG TIME HIS DISCERNMENT TOLD HIM THAT WOOF WAS GROWING UP UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HE WAS A DOG
SHE GAVE A BURST OF SHRILL HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER AND RAN AT IT AS A TRAPPED RAT WILL JUMP AT A HAND APPROACHING THE WIRES
SELECTING A FISH TO HIS TASTE HE ATE IT AT GREAT LEISURE LEAVING THE HEAD AND THE TAIL UPON THE GRASS
HE WISHED HIMSELF SAFELY LANDED
WHEN THE CHOPPERS AND DRIVERS CAME TROOPING IN FOR DINNER THEY WERE SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK TO FIND A HUGE BEAR SLEEPING BESIDE THE STOVE
THE RUNNERS OF THE HIGH PEAKS MOTIONLESS UPON HIS KNIFE-EDGED PINNACLE THE GREAT BROWN RAM STOOD POISED HIS GRAY UPLIFTED MUZZLE OUT-THRUST TOWARD THE SUNRISE AS IF HE WOULD SNIFF IN ITS ROSE-RED GLORIES AS THEY FLAMED ACROSS THE ICE PEAKS OF THE JAGGED HORIZON

HE REMARKED TO JEFF--WITH WHOM HE COULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO SPEAK MORE FRANKLY THAN TO MOST--THAT AN OCCASIONAL CREEPY FEELING ABOUT THE ROOTS OF ONE'S HAIR MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE SCALP A PREVENTIVE OF BALDNESS EVEN
BUT HE REFRAINED LEST HE SHOULD GIVE THE ALARM TO THE UNKNOWN ENEMY WHOM HE WAS HUNTING
THEY TOLD OF A REMARKABLE LEVEL PLATEAU LIKE A TABLE FOR THE GODS WITH A LITTLE LAKE OF BLACK CRYSTAL SET IN THE CENTER OF IT ICE COLD AND OF UNFATHOMABLE DEPTH
AS WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT LIFTED HIS HEAD THE WHITE WOLF STOPPED HOWLING DROPPED HIS NOSE AND STARED EARNESTLY INTO THE MAN'S EYES
AFTER HE HAD GIVEN THE CROWD THEIR MONEY'S WORTH IN SWIFT MOUNTINGS AND BREATH-TAKING VOLS-PLANES HE STARTED OFF AT A HEIGHT OF SOME TWO THOUSAND FEET TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN STANDING PALLID AND GRIM AGAINST THE INTENSE BLUE
IT WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY HANDY WEAPON THE STOOL BUT JOHN HATCH WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY PRUDENT MAN
THEN JUST AS THE DRAG WITH ITS DARK PATHETIC BURDEN WAS DISAPPEARING AROUND A TURN OF THE TRAIL SHE STARTED AFTER IT AND QUICKLY OVERTOOK IT WITH HER UNGAINLY SHAMBLING RUN
EACH NIGHT THEY CAMPED AND IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING OVERTOOK THE SLOW-MOVING HOST ON THEIR TIRELESS MUSTANGS
IN REPLY THE BULL MADE ANOTHER EARNEST EFFORT TO REACH HIM
THERE WERE STILL RED COALS UNDER THE ASHES SO THEY REVIVED THE FIRE SMOKED AND GOT THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY WARM
THEIR PUNY STRUGGLES HAD NOT LONG BEEN STILLED--FIVE MINUTES PERHAPS OR TEN--WHEN THE MOTHER-LYNX ARRIVED AT THE EDGE OF THE POOL
THE TRAIL OF STRIPPED RED CARCASSES WHICH THEY LEFT BEHIND THEM GLUTTED ALL THE WOLVES COYOTES AND CARRION CROWS FOR LEAGUES ABOUT AND AFFRONTED THE WHOLESOME DAYLIGHT OF THE PLAINS
HE FLEW ONWARD TILL SOON HE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE FIELD BUT SO HIGH THAT TO THE SPECTATORS AROUND THE EDGES OF THE FIELD HE WAS A SCARCELY VISIBLE SPECK AGAINST THE BLUE
THE FEET OF THE FURTIVE DECORATED CLOTH 12MO $1.35 ILLUSTRATED BY PAUL BRANSOM IT IS TO BE DOUBTED WHETHER THERE IS A MORE POPULAR ANIMAL WRITER TO-DAY THAN CHARLES G
HE HAD NO USE FOR FISH TOO BIG TO BE SWALLOWED WHOLE
HIS MALICIOUS EYES SET CLOSE TOGETHER IN HIS CRUEL TRIANGULAR FACE DETECTED AT ONCE THE SLEEPING FORM OF THE GRAY VISITOR AND GLOWED DEEPLY AS IF ALL AT ONCE TRANSFORMED TO DROPS OF GARNET
HE KNEW AT ONCE WHAT IT WAS THAT WITH SLOW-MOVING DELIBERATE WINGS CAME UP NEVERTHELESS SO SWIFTLY
THEY WERE VERY FAR BELOW HIM NOW HARDLY ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE PLATEAU FLYING IN OCCASIONALLY OVER ITS EDGES BUT FOR THE MOST PART CIRCLING OUT ABOVE THE SURROUNDING GULFS
THEN HIS ATTENTION WAS ABRUPTLY WITHDRAWN FROM THEIR THREATENING EVOLUTIONS
YOUNG AS IT WAS WHEN HE PICKED IT UP IT WHIMPERED WITH TERROR AND STRUCK OUT WITH ITS BABY PAWS RECOGNIZING THE SMELL OF AN ENEMY
BUT INSTEAD OF FORCING A COMBAT OR RATHER A SUCCESSION OF COMBATS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH HOLDING HIS STRAITENED GROUND FIRMLY RATHER THAN PROVOCATIVELY
HIS HERD ASTONISHED BUT OBEDIENT LOWERED THEIR MASSIVE HEADS AND CHARGED AT HIS HEELS
INSTANTLY WITH A GASP SHE SLAMMED IT TO AGAIN AND LEANED AGAINST IT WITH QUAKING KNEES
THEN HE MOVED THE FIRE CLOSER IN TOWARD THE FOOT OF THE ROCK IN ORDER THAT A SMALLER BLAZE MIGHT SUFFICE TO WARM HIM THROUGH THE NIGHT
NO ONE WHO VALUED FRESH-CAUGHT TROUT AT THEIR FULL WORTH WOULD LEAVE THEM THUS UNGUARDED UNLESS FOR A SINISTER PURPOSE
TWO ENEMIES HE HAD SO STRONG AND CUNNING THAT THE MENACE OF THEM WAS NEVER VERY FAR FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
SHE FAWNED UPON THE MAN COAXINGLY LIFTED HERSELF WITH HER FOREPAWS UPON HIS COAT AND REACHED UP TILL SHE COULD LICK THE SLEEPING CUB
AFTER HIS PIPE HE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL DOWN TO THE GLADES
THEN WITH BELTS DEEPLY DRAWN IN THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY IN DOGGED SILENCE
BUT BEHIND HIM OVERTAKING HIM INEXORABLY CAME THE SHAPE THAT STOOD FOR DOOM ITSELF IN THE EYES OF ALL HIS TRIBE--THE DREADFUL BLUE FALCON OR DUCK-HAWK
WOOF SCRATCHED AND WHINED AGAIN
NOTHING ELSE STIRRED AND THERE WAS NO OTHER LIVING CREATURE TO BE DISCERNED
BUT WHEN STORM WAS IN THE AIR SHE REGARDED HIM NO MORE THAN A BLACK POODLE
THE SMELL OF THE DEEP WOODS BEYOND THE PASTURE FIELDS DREW HIM STRANGELY
BUT MACCREEDY HAD ANOTHER OBJECT IN VIEW WHICH HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT LEST MATTER-OF-FACT FOLK SHOULD CALL HIM CHILDISH
THANK YOU WHITE BROTHER HE SAID SIMPLY WITH FIRM CONFIDENCE THAT THE MYSTICAL BEAST COULD UNDERSTAND HUMAN SPEECH IN THE TONGUE OF THE NASQUAPEES
HIS CONFIDENCE WOULD HAVE GONE TO PIECES IN UNCOMPREHENDED TERROR HAD HE KNOWN THAT THE MAN WITH A PAIR OF POWERFUL GLAMS TO HIS EYES WAS STUDYING HIM MINUTELY AND COULD SEE HIM AS CLEARLY AS IF HE WERE NOT MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
OR WOULD YE RATHER BE ET GOOD AN DECENT AN SAVE YE A HEAP O FRETTIN CONTINUED LONG JACKSON PERSUASIVELY
ALL THE WAY TO THE CABIN SHE FOLLOWED CLOSELY NOSING FROM TIME TO TIME AT THE UNRESPONSIVE FIGURE ON THE DRAG

HE COULD RAGE WITHIN REASON AND HIS REASON ADMONISHED HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THIS FIGHT IF IT COULD BE MANAGED
BLUE FOX COULD RUN FAST BUT HIS BEST SPEED WAS SLOW IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF HIS GAUNT AND LONG-LIMBED FOES
THE GREAT TREES HOWEVER HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO KILL OUT THE BUSHY UNDERGROWTH WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP LUXURIANTLY IN THE WAKE OF THE CHOPPERS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE FOREST ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL WAS A DENSE RIOT OF JUNGLE TO THE HEIGHT OF SIX OR EIGHT FEET
IT HAD BEEN MERELY CLOSED NOT LATCHED
ITS HEAD WAS ALMOST TRIANGULAR
THIS WAS HIS OWN GAME WHICH THE MAN WAS STALKING
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON A MYSTERIOUS HAZE OF A LOVELY ROSY SAFFRON HUE APPEARED IN THE SOUTHEAST BEYOND THE RIVER
ABOUT HALFWAY UP A SPARSELY WOODED HILLSIDE TO HIS RIGHT HE MARKED A STEEP-FACED BOULDER AT THE FOOT OF WHICH HE RESOLVED TO MAKE HIS STAND
AND FROM TIME TO TIME ONE WOULD RETURN LAZILY PERHAPS WITH THE TAIL OF A SMALLER RELATION STICKING OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND SETTLE DOWN UNDER THE BANK TO DIGEST ITS HEAVY MEAL
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A HAWK IN SIGHT
HATCH WAS A GOOD SHOT AND HE FELT SURE THAT HE HAD SCORED A HIT
BUT THAT NIGHT THE TINY LONELY REMNANT OF THE VANISHED MYRIADS OF THEIR KIN THEY FED AND SLEPT SECURELY IN A WELL-GRASSED GLADE AMONG THE HILLS
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BEAR HAVING ONCE LEARNED THAT THIS WAS A POSSIBLE WAY IN WAS DETERMINED TO TEST IT TO THE UTMOST
JABE SMITH BEGAN TO DISCOURAGE THE DEMONSTRATIVENESS OF JINNY TRUSTING HER EXAMPLE WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED EFFECT UPON THE CUB
THE DOWNY WINGS OF THE GRAY VISITOR LIFTED
MOREOVER THE BODY OF THE RED HEIFER DEAD AND DILAPIDATED THOUGH IT WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND A LINK WITH THE HAPPY PAST
HE WAS LOW ENOUGH NOW TO CHOOSE HIS LANDING-PLACE
WHEN HE HAD QUITE SATISFIED HIS OWN HUNGER AND WITH LIFTED NOSTRILS SNIFFED SUSPICIOUSLY EVERY AIR THAT DREW UPWARD FROM THE WOODS THE OLD RAM LED HIS FLOCK FURTHER DOWN INTO ONE OF THOSE STEEP GLENS WHERE THE GRASS WAS MORE ABUNDANT
BEFORE HE COULD RECOVER HIMSELF THE AVENGER STRUCK AGAIN WITH THE FULL DRIVE OF HIS POWERFUL NECK AND THE STROKE WENT HOME
BUT HIS LITTLE RED-RIMMED SAVAGE EYES NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FIGURE OF THE GIRL FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS AT A TIME
BUT WHEN THAT DARK AWFUL TORRENT OF ROLLING MANES WILD EYES KEEN HORNS AND SHATTERING HOOFS DREW CLOSE UPON THE WAITING GROUPS OF MEN THESE LIFTED THEIR GUNS AND FIRED ONE AFTER THE OTHER STRAIGHT IN THE FACES OF THE NEAREST BULLS
INTO HIS STORIES CREEP SNATCHES OF HUMOR GLIMPSES OF TRAGEDY AND THE POIGNANT TOUCH OF PATHOS ALL OF WHICH MAKE HIS WORK NATURAL
HURRIEDLY BUT CAREFULLY THE MAN THRUST SOME DRY STICKS INTO THE EMBERS AND FANNED THEM INTO FLAME
IT WAS ON HIS TRAIL THAT PATCH OF DEATH
IT WAS A POIGNANTLY MUSICAL SOUND BUT FULL OF MENACE AND DEFIANCE AND IT CARRIED A LONG WAY ON THAT STILL RESILIENT AIR
THE CRISP STILL AIR WAS LIKE WINE IN HIS VEINS
INSTANTLY THERE WAS A SHRILL VICIOUS SNARL FROM WITHIN AND A WIDE-OPEN TRIANGULAR MOUTH SET WITH WHITE TEETH DARTED AT HIS NOSE
HE ROUNDED A TURN OF THE TRAIL AND THERE BEFORE HIM STOOD A LOGGING CAMP
THEN HALTING ABRUPTLY HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN SURPRISE
SOME TEN OR A DOZEN PACES DISTANT TETHERED BENEATH THE BIRCH TREE A SORREL HORSE MUNCHED THE LAST REMNANTS OF A BUNDLE OF HAY AND WHISKED HIS LONG TAIL INDUSTRIOUSLY TO KEEP OFF THE FLIES
A FULL THIRD OF THE HOST HAD BEEN BLOTTED FROM EXISTENCE
THE GAME WAS COMING HIS WAY AND IT WAS THE POT NOT SPORT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING
THEN THE SUN CAME BACK TO THE WASTE PLACES AND BLUE FOX RETURNED TO HIS HUNTING
JEFF SAID HE IF YE WARN'T SO BLANKETY BLANK BLANK AFEERD O LYNXES YE'D HELP ME A SIGHT IN RUNNIN THEM VARMIN DOWN
SHAKING OFF HIS NONCHALANCE HE GOT UP STRETCHED HIMSELF ELABORATELY AND TROTTED DOWN BRISKLY INTO THE TUNDRA
THERE WERE ROOTS TO BE GRUBBED UP GRUBS WORMS AND BEETLES ALREADY SLUGGISH WITH THE COLD TO BE FOUND UNDER STONES AND LOGS AND ANT-HILLS TO BE RAVISHED
WITH A SAVAGE CURSE HE WHEELED ABOUT SWINGING UP HIS AXE
THEREFORE SMALL AS SHE WAS SHE WAS APT TO BE VERY DANGEROUS EVEN TO GO OFF AT TIMES WITH FLAME AND A TERRIFYING NOISE
SHE FLAPPED OVER FOR A NEARER VIEW FLEW CLOSE ENOUGH TO HEAR THE MYSTERIOUS ROAR OF THE MOTOR AND TO DETECT THE MAN-CREATURE RIDING THE MONSTER'S NECK AND FLED BACK TO HER NESTLINGS WITH RAGE AND TERROR AT HER HEART
TORONTO ILLUSTRATION
THEN THEY SAW HIM TURN--AT SUCH A HEIGHT THAT EVEN TO THEIR POWERFUL GLASSES THE PURSUING EAGLES WERE NO MORE THAN SPECKS--AND SOAR BACK TILL HE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT
FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER IT WAS CLOSE COVERT WHICH HE WANTED WHERE HE COULD ESCAPE THE GLARE OF THE SUN AND SLEEP OFF HIS GREAT MEAL
HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED
HE FELT THAT HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED
TO THE FISH THAT DWELT IN IT THE POOL WAS AN ABIDING PLACE OF PERFECTION
ALL THE WIDE GLIMMERING TWILIGHT WORLD BENEATH HIM WAS VERY STILL AND QUIET
BUT YE AIN'T GOT NO NERVE LEFT
THERE WAS THE BEAR A FEW PACES UP THE ROAD CALMLY SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES WAITING
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S METHODS OF FIGHTING
UP CAME THAT DARTING STROKE TO MEET HIM
THE STRAGGLERS OLD AND YOUNG WERE THEIR PREY OR SOMETIMES A WOUNDED BULL WORSTED IN BATTLE AND DRIVEN FROM HIS HERD AND WEAK FROM LOSS OF BLOOD
THIS FIRED HIS COMRADES TO A MORE IMPLACABLE SAVAGERY
AND THE MOTHER DRY-EYED BUT WITH DESPAIR AT HER HEART HAD LET HIM GO
HE WAS CONTENTED WITH HIS EXPLORATIONS AND READY NOW TO RETURN AND TELL ABOUT THEM
HE HAD BEEN NOW SOME SIX MONTHS ABSENT FROM HOME GUIDING A PARTY OF PROSPECTORS AND HIS HEART WAS TROUBLED WITH DESIRE FOR THE LITTLE LONELY CLUSTER OF LODGES ON THE SHORE OF THE MICHIKAMAW
THE PALE PURPLING OF THE VIOLETS THE AERIAL GREENING OF THE BIRCH TOPS AGAINST THE MISTY SKY THE SOLEMNITY OF THE DARK MASSED FIR TREES--IT WAS ALL BEAUTIFUL IN HER EYES BEYOND ANYTHING WORDS COULD SUGGEST BUT IT MADE HER HEART ACHE WITH SOMETHING LIKE AN INTOLERABLE HOMESICKNESS
BUT EVEN NOW THE BREEZE FAILING HE HAD TO RECOVER HIS IMPETUS BY A RUSHING DESCENT
BUT HE COULD FIND NO CHANCE TO STRIKE LEST HE SHOULD INJURE THE DOG
SERVE HIM RIGHT FOR BEING LICKED BUT WHEN AT LAST THE WOUNDED OUTCAST WAS SET UPON BY FOUR BIG TIMBER WOLVES AND PULLED BELLOWING TO HIS KNEES THAT WAS ANOTHER AFFAIR
DRAKE TEAL HUNGER AND WRATH WERE ALL ALIKE FORGOTTEN AND HE BEAT UPWARDS WITH A RUSH THAT MADE THE REEL FAIRLY SCREECH ITS INDIGNANT PROTEST
HERE WERE THE PRINTS OF HORSES HOOVES
THE REMAINING THIRD WAS OF SEA WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT OVERHUNG THE TOWN OF X AND WERE WITHHELD ONLY BY A MIRACLE FROM FLOWING IN AND FILLING THE BOWL
HE PUSHED ON AGAIN AND IMMEDIATELY HE FELT IN HIS SPINE IN HIS HAIR THAT THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST TO RIGHT AND TO LEFT WERE FULL OF MOVING LIFE
HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT A GRAY SHADOW FLITTED AWAY BEHIND THE GRAY TRUNKS
WHEN ONCE MORE THEY DESCENDED TO THE TIMBER BELT AND ITS SEDUCTIVE PASTURAGE THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR MILES OF TANGLED RIDGE AND RAVINE BETWEEN THEM AND THE SCENE OF THEIR MORNING'S ADVENTURE
THERE WAS THE UPTHRUST OF ROCK
THEY SWARMED WITH FISH--LAKE-TROUT WHITE FISH AND HUGE SUCKERS AS WELL AS THE ORDINARY BROOK-TROUT
UP WENT THE GUN
RELUCTANTLY SULLENLY THEY DREW BACK TO WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE EDGE OF THE WOOD
IT WAS SUCH SNEEZING AS HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE
THUS HE FOUND HIMSELF CONFRONTED BY A NEW PERIL
THER AIN'T NO GAME-WARDEN ON ARTH AS KIN BLAME ME FOR THAT BUT THE MATTER WAS NOT YET AS NEAR CONCLUSION AS HE IMAGINED
IT WAS IN EFFECT ACCORDING TO TRADITION BOTTOMLESS
AMONG THE LODGES BESIDE THE BLEAK MICHIKAMAW THE CHILD GREW UP WITHOUT MISADVENTURE
UNDER HIS WEIGHT THE DOOR CAME CRASHING DOWN BUT SLOWLY WITH THE NOISE OF YIELDING LATCH AND SNAPPING IRON
KEEPING PARALLEL WITH THE ROAD BUT AT A DISTANCE AND HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS WENT AN IMMENSE AND GAUNT BLACK BEAR
CLOTH
CLOTH
TO HIS SURPRISE IT REFUSED TO BE TOSSED
AS HE SAT BY HIS KITCHEN FIRE SMOKING COMFORTABLY HIS CHORES ALL DONE UP THE BATTLE-SCARRED DOG ASLEEP BESIDE HIS CHAIR AND FORGIVING TABBY CURLED UP ON HIS KNEE AND THE TWANG OF NIGHT-HAWKS IN A CLEAR SKY COMING IN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW WITH THE FRESH SMELL OF THE DEW HE CHUCKLED AT HIS OWN FOLLY
IT WAS A MONGREL METHOD OF PROGRESSION IN WHICH HE WAS SINGULARLY EXPERT
LIFTING HIS WIDE WINGS HE HOPPED DOWN INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE WRECK WHICH WAS HALF-FILLED WITH MUD AND DEBRIS
FROM SOMEWHERE FAR TO THE LEFT CAME NOW A BAND OF WHITE HUNTERS WHO RODE AROUND THE HOST AND ATTACKED IT ON BOTH FLANKS AT ONCE
VERY ANGRY--TOO ANGRY TO FIND EXPRESSION IN EVEN THE MOST UNPARLIAMENTARY OF SPEECH--HE ROSE TO HIS FEET SET THE PAIL OF MILK BESIDE ITS FELLOW GRABBED THE STURDY MILKING-STOOL BY ONE LEG VAULTED THE FENCE AND PLUNGED INTO THE WOODS
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS NETTLED AT ITS PRESUMPTION IN THUS DOGGING HIS TRAIL
THERE WERE ALSO THE NESTS OF BEES AND WASPS PUNGENT BUT SAVORY
IN ANOTHER TEN MINUTES THE ROOF WAS ABLAZE AND SOON THE FLAMES WERE SHOOTING UP RIOTOUSLY
THE WILY DRAKE HAD PLUNGED WITH THE PLUNGE OF THE FALL ITSELF AND WAS NOW DARTING ONWARD AT A SAFE DEPTH
THE INDIANS WITHDREW LONG BEFORE NIGHTFALL
FOR ALL THE SPLENDOR OF HIS PLUMAGE THE MERGANSER WAS NOT CONSPICUOUS WHERE HE SAT
ROBERTS
THE JOURNEY WAS UNEVENTFUL
THE BEES AND FLIES KEPT UP A SOFT HUM THE VERY VOICE OF SLEEP AMONG THE CLOVER BLOSSOMS SCATTERED THROUGH THE GRASS AND THE HOT SCENTS OF THE WILD PARSNIP STEAMED UP OVER THE LEVELS LIKE AN UNSEEN INCENSE
AN ABANDONED CLEARING OR A DESERTED LOG CABIN SOMETHING TO WHICH MAN HAS SET HIS HAND AND THEN WITHDRAWN IT SEEMS ALWAYS A PLACE OF PECULIAR FASCINATION TO THE CREATURES OF THE WILDERNESS
SHE HEARD THE HEAVY LATCH LIFT WITH A CLICK

THERE'S CONROY'S CAMP RIGHT AHEAD CRIED BRANNIGAN
ONLY THE OTHER DAY INDEED HE HAD CLEARED OUT ITS INHABITANTS DEVOURING THEIR LITTER OF YOUNG
THEY NOTICED THAT THE HOST WAS A SCANTY ONE COMPARED WITH THE COUNTLESS MYRIADS OF PRECEDING YEARS
HE GREW RESTLESS
BUT ALAS ITS UTTER CLEARNESS WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO SHATTER ITS CHIEF MYSTERY
HE DREW GRADUALLY NEARER AND AS HE APPROACHED HE BEGAN TO FORGET THE OTHER GAME IN A SAVAGE INTEREST IN THIS NEW AND DANGEROUS QUARRY
HE FACED ABOUT AND SWUNG UP HIS AXE HIS LEAN DARK JAW SET GRIMLY
THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT
AND ALL THE TIME JEFF WAS TUGGING MADLY AT JOHN HATCH'S ARM ADJURING HIM TO WAKE AND MEET THE PERIL
HE FLOATED UPWARD FROM OUT HIS COVERT LIKE A GHOST FROM A POOL CIRCLED OVER IT TWICE AND FLEW OFF TO THOSE HIGH AND LONELY TREETOPS WHICH HE HAD MARKED IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE DAY
IN HIS EYES ALL LYNXES WERE VERMIN OF THE WORST KIND
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS--GOING ON FOR FOUR NOW INDEED--SISSY BEMBRIDGE HAD BEEN AWAY FROM THIS WILD HOME WORKING HARD AND SAVING HER WAGES IN THE BIG SHOE FACTORY AT K DOWN BY THE SEA
THEN AS IF IN ANSWER TO HER VEHEMENT KNOCKING THE DOOR SWUNG SLOWLY OPEN SHOWING THE BLACK DARKNESS WITHIN
NOW HE HAD FORSAKEN THE TRAILS OF MOOSE AND BEAR AND CARIBOU TO SEEK THE ELUSIVE COLOR IN THE SANDS OF THE MOUNTAIN STREAMS OR THE UNOBTRUSIVE OUTCROP OF THE QUARTZ THAT CARRIES GOLD
WITH A SOFT SWISHING CRACKLING ROAR DOWN CAME THE TREE
THE BUGLING WAS SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED AT BRIEF INTERVALS AND THEN IT WAS ANSWERED DEFIANTLY FROM FAR ON THE LEFT
BUT CARE-FREE AS HE WAS BLUE FOX NEVER FORGOT THAT THE PRICE OF FREEDOM FROM CARE WAS ETERNAL VIGILANCE
SUCH VIGILANT AND UNTIRING VINDICTIVENESS ON THE PART OF CREATURES WHICH ARE WONT TO SHUN ALL HUMAN NEIGHBORHOOD WITH AN INCORRIGIBLE SAVAGERY OF SHYNESS WAS UNNATURAL
AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO RISK THE WASTING OF A SINGLE SHOT
BUT ALL THE CUB REALLY ASKED OF MILK WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE WARM AND ABUNDANT
AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
IT DROPPED WITH STARTLING SUDDENNESS INTO A POCKET AND FELL AS IF A VACUUM HAD OPENED BENEATH IT
A SPORTING CHANCE HOWEVER SMALL WAS ENOUGH FOR HIS COURAGEOUS SPIRIT AND HE RACED ON WITH GOOD HEART AT A PACE WHICH SOON STRETCHED HIS LUNGS NEAR TO BURSTING
HIS LONG LOW SINUOUS BODY GLIDING ALMOST LIKE A SNAKE'S HE SLIPPED UP TO WITHIN A COUPLE OF FEET OF THE SLEEPER AND PAUSED IRRESOLUTE
JOHN HATCH LOOKED AT THE DOG MUSINGLY
ROBERTS NEW BOOK CHILDREN OF THE WILD THE READER IS BROUGHT VERY CLOSE TO NATURE
THE NEXT MOMENT THE WHOLE FLOCK WAS PASSING OVER HIM A BEWILDERING BOMBARDMENT OF SMALL KEEN BATTERING HOOFS AND WOOLLY BODIES
HE JERKED HIS HEAD INTO COVER AGAIN JUST AS THE BIRD MADE ANOTHER LIGHTNING CLUTCH AT HIM
AND HE STOPPED HALF-TURNING TO GO BACK
WITH THE MADNESS OF UTTER TERROR HE LOWERED HIS MIGHTY HEAD AND CHARGED THIS DARK MASS THAT BARRED HIS FLIGHT
THEN JACKSON SCRATCHED ONE MATCH CAUTIOUSLY
SMOKING ENDLESSLY FEEDING THE LITTLE FIRE AND CROUCHING OVER IT THINKING OF THE WIGWAM ON THE LONE WHITE SHORE OF THE MICHIKAMAW AND WATCHING EVER THAT DREAD HALF-CIRCLE OF HUNGRY EYES AND THE GAUNT TIRELESSLY PATROLLING SHAPE OF HIS WHITE SENTINEL HE BEGAN TO SEE STRANGE VISIONS
IN THIS REMOTE DISTRICT THE GRIZZLIES HAD NOT YET LEARNED THE VITAL LESSON THAT MAN IS BY FAR THE MOST FORMIDABLE OF ALL THE ANIMALS
MR ROBERTS HAS WRITTEN MANY STORIES ABOUT THE WILD ALL OF WHICH HAVE THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH FEW WRITERS ARE ABLE TO BREATHE INTO THEIR BOOKS--THE ATMOSPHERE OF OUTDOOR LIFE TOLD WITH THE SURE TOUCH OF A RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE RECOGNIZED THAT REMOTE HUNDRED-AND-FIRST CHANCE
HE REACHED A TURN OF THE WOOD ROAD WHERE IT CRESTED A RISE ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM HIS CLEARING AND SAW HIS HOMELY CABIN WITH ITS FARMYARD AND ITS FIELDS BASKING IN THE LOW AFTERNOON SUNSHINE STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
HIS LONG MUZZLE WAS LIFTED STRAIGHT IN THE AIR AND HE WAS HOWLING TO THE DECREPIT MOON
FOR A GOOD TEN MINUTES NOTHING MORE HAPPENED THOUGH FROM TIME TO TIME HER INTENT EARS CAUGHT THE SOUND OF CAUTIOUS SNIFFING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOG WALLS AS IF THE ENEMY WERE RECONNOITERING TO FIND A WEAK POINT IN HER FORTRESS
HERE IN THIS PRESERVATIVE TEMPERATURE HE DEPOSITED THE BODY OF THE FAT LEMMING AND COVERED THE PLACE FROM PRYING EYES WITH HERBAGE AND BUSH DRAWN LIGHTLY OVER IT
SHE TRIED TO TEAR OFF A STRIP OF HER PETTICOAT TO BIND IT DOWN WITH BUT ALL HER UNDERWEAR WAS OF A MOST SERVICEABLE STURDINESS AND WOULD NOT TEAR
HIS FIERCE RED EYES STARING DOWN FIXEDLY INTO THE FLOWING AMBER OF THE CURRENT MARKED PIERCINGLY EVERY FISH THAT PASSED UP AND DOWN
WHEN THE GREAT CHARGE WAS MET BY THE ROAR AND THE SPIRTING FLAMES THE LEADING BULL WENT DOWN AND THE FRONT RANK SPLIT AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO PASS ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS TERRIFYING OBSTACLE
A LATE AND AGED MOON HUNG DISTORTED JUST OVER THE LINE OF THE TREETOPS BEFORE HIM
BROWN BULL'S HERD FELT A SICKENING EMPTINESS IN THEIR LUNGS AND THEN A WIND WHICH ALMOST LIFTED THEM FROM THEIR FEET
THEN GETTING HER FAIRLY CORNERED IN A BEND OF THE THICKETS HE SPRANG SAVAGELY FOR HER THROAT
THEIR BULK AND THE POWER OF THEIR SINEWY TAILS ALONE PROTECTED THEM FROM THE TROUT WHOSE WIDE RAPACIOUS JAWS AND INSATIABLE APPETITE WERE EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING THE SIZE OF ALL THE POOL-DWELLERS UP TO STANDARD
HE GOT A CHOKING MOUTHFUL OF FEATHERS
THE SNORING HAD STOPPED SUDDENLY
AND HUMAN FLESH HE EITHER FEARS OR DISLIKES SO HEARTILY THAT ONLY UNDER SPECIAL STRESS CAN HE BRING HIMSELF TO CONTEMPLATE IT AS A POSSIBLE ARTICLE OF DIET
HIS PURPOSE WAS TO GO TO EUROPE AND WIN FAME BY SOME SENSATIONAL FLIGHTS OVER THE ALPS OR THE PYRENEES
AS THEY CIRCLED EACH SPARRING FOR A CHANCE TO CATCH THE OTHER AT A DISADVANTAGE THE DEAD TROUT LAY GLEAMING AND BLEEDING ON THE TURF BETWEEN THEM
HIS ASSAILANT WAS BIGGER THAN HE BETTER NOURISHED AND FAR STRONGER
THE HERD FELL TO FEEDING AT ONCE AS IF NOTHING IN THE LEAST UNUSUAL HAD HAPPENED
BUT THIS DID NOT TROUBLE HIM AS HE FELT SURE HE WOULD PICK UP THE TRAIL IN COURSE OF TIME
BUT THERE WAS NO HINT OF DANGER ANYWHERE TO BE DISCERNED
SIX OF THEM SHE HAD BORNE BUT FIVE HAD BEEN STRAIGHTWAY TAKEN FROM HER AND DROWNED
THERE WAS ROOM IN HIS SOUL FOR NO EMOTION BUT THE RAGE OF THE AVENGER
SHE'S KEP US FROM FREEZIN OH YE NEEDN'T GIT CRUSTY OVER WHAT I'VE SAID TOM REPLIED JACKSON RUBBING THE LONG BROWN EARS TENDERLY
AND BUT FOR HIS PRIDE HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE DOUBTFUL VENTURE WHICH NOW INVOLVED HIM
HE WAS NOW FURIOUS AT THE LACK OF HIS RIFLE AND VOWED NEVER AGAIN TO GO WITHOUT IT
HAD HER OWN PUPS BEEN LEFT TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE LAVISHED EVERY CARE AND TENDERNESS UPON THEM DURING THE ALLOTTED SPAN OF WEEKS AND THEN WITH INEXORABLE DECISION SHE WOULD HAVE WEANED AND PUT THEM AWAY FOR THEIR SOULS GOOD
THE HEAT SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN AWAY THEIR APPETITES
HE WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT AGAIN NOT HE
MR ROBERTS POSSESSES A KEEN ARTISTIC SENSE WHICH IS ESPECIALLY MARKED WHEN HE IS ROUNDING SOME STORY TO ITS END
SHE RETURNED FOR HER BUNDLE WENT IN AND SHUT THE DOOR
WELL HE WOULD NOT DIE PULLED DOWN LIKE A FLEEING DOE FROM BEHIND
WITH EQUAL ALERTNESS THE PANTHER SUCCEEDED IN ELUDING THE STROKE
THE NEXT INSTANT THE OTTER'S TEETH SNAPPED AT HIS THROAT BUT MISSED HOLD BY A HAIR'S BREADTH
THE SAW-TOOTHED EDGES OF HIS BEAK GRIPPED IT SECURELY AND HE ROSE WITH IT TO THE SURFACE JUST WHERE THE CHUTE WAS BREAKING INTO A SMOTHER OF TRAMPLED FOAM
A HALF-ROTTED STUMP CLOSE TO THE GROUND OFFERED HIM AN INVITING PERCH AND IN HALF A MINUTE HE WAS THE SOUNDEST-SLEEPING GRAY OWL ON THIS SIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
LAST CAME THE GREAT RAM SNORTING WITH WRATH AND FEAR
STRAIGHTWAY IT WOULD CLOSE UP AGAIN DRAWING AWAY FROM THE THICKETS
AS THE WOLVES CAME UP THE FUGITIVE COULD HEAR THE STRONG RELENTLESS PADDING OF THEIR FEET AND THEN HALF A MINUTE LATER THE MEASURED HISS OF THEIR BREATHING THE OCCASIONAL HARD CLICK OF THEIR FANGS
WITH THE SETTING IN OF THE SNOW HE HAD QUICKLY CHANGED HIS COAT TO A LIKE COLOR
IN THE MEANTIME THE HOUSEHOLD OF BLUE FOX LIKE ALL THE OTHER HOUSEHOLDS IN THE LITTLE COLONY HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED IN NUMBERS
ON THIS POINT AT LEAST SHE HAD NO ANXIETY
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE FOURTH DAY OF HIS JOURNEY HE CROSSED THE FRESH TRAIL OF A WOLF-PACK RUNNING EAST
BUT ALL THE HERDS DRIFTED SOUTHWARD TOGETHER IN FULL ACCORD NOW JOURNEYING NOW HALTING NOW MOVING AGAIN AS IF ORGANIZED AND ORDERED BY SOME ONE CENTRAL AND INFLEXIBLE CONTROL
THE HEAVY SOFT-NOSED BULLET CRASHED HOME
THE LYNXES HAD LONG PRACTICED PATIENCE AND FOR ALL THEIR HATE THEY WERE PRUDENT
FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR THE GRAY VISITOR NEVER STIRRED NEVER RUFFLED A FEATHER--NOT EVEN WHEN A GORGEOUS BLACK-AND-RED BUTTERFLY ALIGHTED WITH SOFTLY FANNING WINGS WITHIN A FOOT OF HIM
THE WHOLE OF THIS DISTRICT WAS INTERLACED WITH WATERCOURSES AND SOWN WITH LAKES HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE OUTLET IN THE TIDAL ESTUARY WHICH WASHED THE WHARVES OF THE TOWN
THE STRANGE-MANNERED DUCK HAD NO PROPER TALONS WHEREWITH TO GRASP HIS PERCH BUT HIS STRONG-CLAWED WEBS HELD HIM STEADILY NONE THE LESS AS HE PEERED DOWNWARD INTO THE CLEAR RUSH OF THE TORRENT
AT THAT SAME INSTANT A LEAN GRAY SHAPE SHOT NOISELESSLY FROM THE UNDERBRUSH STRAIGHT IN HER PATH AND LEAPED AT HER WITH WIDE JAWS
IT LAY OUTSPREAD QUITE FLAT AND SHELTERLESS IN THE SUN ITS SECRETS CLEAN REVEALED AND THERE SURE ENOUGH AT ITS CENTER WAS THE POOL OF TRADITION GLEAMING UPWARD GLASSY STILL
HE HAD THE WISDOM LEARNED IN MANY EVENTFUL MIGRATIONS AND HE CAPTAINED HIS HERD IMPERIOUSLY BEING SURE IN THE MAIN AS TO WHAT WAS BEST FOR THEM
I'M THAT HUNGRY I'D EAT HER AS SHE STANDS HAIR AN ALL RESPONDING TO A CERTAIN YEARNING NOTE IN JACKSON'S VOICE MARY RUBBED HER LONG MUZZLE AGAINST HIM AFFECTIONATELY AND NIBBLED SOFTLY AT HIS SLEEVE
THE LYNX PAUSED AND GLANCED UP INTO A TREE AS IF SUDDENLY INTERESTED IN THE FLITTINGS OF A BLACK-AND-WHITE WOODPECKER
AND ANYHOW HE SAW THAT THE HORSE WAS TETHERED TO THE TREE
AT LAST A NEW INSTINCT HAD BEGUN TO STIR IN THEIR CRUDE INTELLIGENCES AN INSTINCT TO SCATTER TO SHUN THE OLD WELL-WORN TRAILS OF MIGRATION TO SEEK PASTURAGE IN THE REMOTER VALLEYS AND BY SMALL STREAMS WHERE THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT HAD NOT YET TRESPASSED
IN THIS FASHION TOO HE WOULD OFTEN CAPTURE A PTARMIGAN POUNCING UPON IT JUST AS THE STARTLED BIRD WAS SPREADING ITS WINGS FOR FLIGHT
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NO MORE SIGN OF WOLVES AND HE FELT ASSURED THAT HIS STRANGE PROTECTOR HAD LED THEM OFF TO OTHER HUNTING
BROWN BULL LED THE CHARGE STRAIGHT ON AND OVER THE BODY OF THE DYING OUTCAST TRAMPLING IT INTO DREADFUL SHAPELESSNESS
THEY WERE ALL ON THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST FACES OF THE SUMMIT
NEAR THE LIMIT OF THE CLEAR WATER HE OVERTOOK AND SEIZED THE QUARRY WHICH HE HAD MARKED--A TROUT NOT FAR FROM SEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH
IT SEEMED EASY ENOUGH TO GET THEM
PICKING ONE UP IN HIS MOUTH AFTER THE MANNER OF HIS RETRIEVER FOSTER-MOTHER HE CARRIED IT OVER AND LAID IT DOWN AS A HUMBLE OFFERING BESIDE THE BUNK
THE BULL WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A TERRIFIC PAROXYSM BUT THE CRUEL SHOCK OF THIS ASSAULT BROUGHT HIM TO
THEY WERE SURELY LEFT THERE AS A TRAP
IT WAS ONLY A CHANCE BUT IT SEEMED THE ONLY CHANCE
AND HIGH OVERHEAD IN THE UNCLOUDED BLUE A SOARING EAGLE CATCHING BRIEF GLIMPSES OF THE DRAMA THROUGH THE OPENINGS IN THE LEAFAGE GAZED DOWN UPON IT WITH UNWINKING SCORNFUL EYES
THEN CAME THE MEMORY OF HIS ERRAND THE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN AND THE BOY IN THE WIGWAM OF BIRCH BARK HUNGRY AND NEEDING HIM
IF ANYTHING WAS HIT HE WANTED TO GO AND GET IT AND FETCH IT FOR THE MAN AS JABE AND JINNY HAD TAUGHT HIM TO DO
HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT AS HE DESCENDED THE EAGLES ROSE HURRIEDLY TO MEET HIM
HE FORGOT IT IN AN ECSTASY OF DELIGHT
HE DISCERNED INSTANTLY THAT THE PLATFORM OF STICKS WAS A NEST AND THAT AN IMMENSE BIRD WITH AN ASTONISHINGLY LONG HEAD AND BILL WAS SITTING UPON IT
THIS BRANCH WAS THRUST OUT VERY OBLIGINGLY IN JUST THE PLACE WHERE THIS MOST SINGULAR OF DUCKS WOULD HAVE DESIRED IT IF IT HAD BEEN CONSULTED IN THE MATTER
BOTH MEN WERE IN GOOD CONDITION POWERFUL AND ENDURING
BUT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN THE WINDOW
TAKE ME TO MOTHER QUICK
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JOHN HATCH SPENT MOST OF THE TIME IN THE WOODS WITH HIS GUN HUNTING THE COVERTS FOR MILES ABOUT THE CLEARING
BUT MCLAGGAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE WILD CREATURES WENT EVEN FURTHER THAN AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR SPECIAL HABITS AND CHARACTERISTICS
BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF REMEMBERING THAT AFTER ALL HERE WAS SHELTER AND SECURITY FOR THE NIGHT INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO A WET BIVOUAC BENEATH SOME DRIPPING FIR TREE
NONE OF THE WISE MEN OF THE TRIBE COULD DIAGNOSE THE SICKNESS AND THE CHILD WAS NEAR TO DEATH
THEN WITHOUT SURPRISE HE SAW HIS WHITE GUARDIAN THE LIVING PRESENTMENT OF HIS OWN TOTEM GROW AT ONCE TO THE STATURE OF A CARIBOU AND COME AND SIT DOWN OPPOSITE HIM JUST ACROSS THE FIRE AND LOOK MEANINGLY INTO HIS EYES
UP FROM THE FRINGING BUSHES ALONG THE STREAM'S EDGE CAME FURTIVELY A LITTLE LOW LONG-BODIED BEAST IN SHAPE MUCH LIKE AN EXAGGERATED WEASEL BUT ALMOST BLACK IN COLOR
THE SOLITARY FIGURE BENDING TO THE STRAPS OF HIS TOBOGGAN NEVER LOOKED BACK
HIS THOUGHTS WERE ALL ON THE DISTANT WIGWAM OF BIRCH BARK AND THE WOMAN AND CHILD WITHIN IT WHO MIGHT BE HUNGRY
TO THE EYE IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BULGE IN THE ENORMOUS MONOTONY OF THE LEVELS
THEN HE CAME UP AMONG SOME ARROWWEEDS LIFTED HIS HEAD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF ONE OF THE BROAD-BARBED LEAVES AND FLOATED THERE QUIVERING
BUT DOWN HERE ALONG THE EDGE OF THE TIMBER WERE THE DREADED ENEMIES--THE WOLVES THE MOUNTAIN LIONS THE BLACK BEARS AND THE GRIZZLIES
THEN HE AROSE SLOWLY AND SAUNTERED OFF INTO THE FOREST
THE GREAT GRAY TIMBER WOLVES HOWEVER WERE HONORED WITH MORE ATTENTION
HE HAD FIRST TO STAMP HIS CHALLENGE SEVERAL TIMES SNORT VEHEMENTLY AND ADVANCE HIS ANTLERS IN FAIR WARNING
BUT THIS BEAR WAS OLD AND OF RIPE EXPERIENCE
THE CONTENTS WERE MISCELLANEOUS AS MCLAGGAN HAD BEEN IN TO THE SETTLEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPLENISHING HIS STORES
HIS FAMILY CONSISTED MERELY OF MRS SMITH A SMALL BUT VARYING NUMBER OF CATS AND KITTENS JINNY AND WOOF
HE SHIFTED HIS FORE-PAWS TO THE BACK OF THE WAGON AND STUDIED THE SITUATION
BUT NOW IT WAS BORNE IN UPON HIM THAT HE MUST MAKE PROVISION AGAINST IT
IT MUST BE ONE OF HIS OWN PEOPLE
THE AEROPLANE ROCKED UNDER HER STRUGGLES BUT IN THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS THROWN CLEAR SO BADLY CRUMPLED THAT SHE FELL TOPSY-TURVY THROUGH THE AIR FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE BEFORE SHE COULD PULL HER WITS TOGETHER AND RIGHT HERSELF
AN ESTRAY FROM THE POLAR NORTH HE HAD BEEN BLOWN FAR OUT TO SEA IN A HURRICANE
RECOVERING HERSELF AFTER A FEW SECONDS SHE FELT HER WAY STEALTHILY TO THE BENCH AND SAT DOWN UPON IT SO AS TO FACE THE TWO WINDOWS
WITH A HISS OF FURY HE POUNCED AT HIS STILT-LEGGED ANTAGONIST STRIKING OUT FRANTICALLY WITH HIS TERRIFIC CLUTCHING TALONS
HE HAD THREE FLIES ON HIS CAST AND BECAUSE IN THESE WATERS THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF HOOKING A GRILSE HE WAS USING HEAVY TACKLE
DID YOU SEE THAT
BUT THE HONEST NEW BRUNSWICK WORKMANSHIP HELD AND SHE TOOK BREATH AGAIN WITH A SOB
BUT FEARLESS AND JOYOUS SLAUGHTERER THOUGH HE WAS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THIS GRAY SHAPE THAT MADE HIM HESITATE
GOOD FISHERMEN BUT NOT EXPERT WOODSMEN THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT HERE IN THE SOLITUDE THEY RAN ANY RISK OF BEING ROBBED OF THEIR MORNING'S SPOILS
JACKSON HEAVED A SIGH OF RESIGNATION SEATED HIMSELF ON THE BODY OF THE SLAIN COW AND FISHED UP HIS STUMPY BLACK CLAY PIPE FROM THE DEPTHS OF HIS BREECHES POCKET
GLANCING BACK AS HE VANISHED UP THE TRAIL HE SAW THE ORPHANED CALF STICK ITS HEAD OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND STARE AFTER HIM PATHETICALLY
HE PRODDED IT SO HARD THAT NOT ONLY ONE PRONG BUT A TINY PROJECTING FORK ALSO WENT CLEAN THROUGH THE TIN
HE KNEW ALSO THAT TO SHOOT A COW MOOSE WAS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL BUT APT TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE
THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN
IT WAS NOT IN THE QUIET POOLS AND LONG DEEP REACHES OF DARK WATER THAT HE LOVED TO SEEK HIS PREY BUT RATHER TO SNATCH IT FROM THE GRASP OF THE LOUD CHUTES AND THE ROARING RIPS
BUT WOOF HAD NOT FORGOTTEN EITHER THE GOOD EXAMPLE OF JINNY OR THE DISCIPLINE OF MRS JABE'S BROOM
IN THE FRONT OF THE WAGON BY THE DASH-BOARD HE FOUND A LUNCH-BASKET STILL HALF FULL AS THE FISHERMEN HAD PROVIDED THEMSELVES FOR ANOTHER SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
AT THE SAME TIME BY THUS KEEPING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE HOST HE SECURED FOR HIS LITTLE KNOT OF SATELLITES THE FRESHEST AND SWEETEST PASTURAGE
THEN AS IF REALIZING ON THE SUDDEN THAT THEY WERE DEAD SHE ALMOST SPURNED THEM FROM HER SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH A LONG YOWL AND RAN AROUND THE POOL TILL SHE AGAIN PICKED UP JOHN HATCH'S TRAIL
THEY WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS COCK A SCORNFUL EYE UP AT IT
AT LAST HE CAUGHT HIMSELF AT IT AS IT WERE AND FOR A MOMENT WONDERED WHAT HE DID IT FOR
BUT AS HE APPEARED TO CLAIM ALL THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS FOSTER-MOTHER JABE SMITH'S FORESEEING EYE CONSIDERED THE TIME NOT FAR DISTANT WHEN THE STURDY AND DEMONSTRATIVE LITTLE ANIMAL WOULD GROW TO A GIANT OF SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS IN WEIGHT AND STILL NO DOUBT CONTINUE TO THINK HE WAS A DOG
THERE WAS NO ENEMY TO BE DESCRIED EITHER IN THE STILL SHADOWED VALLEYS OR ON THE BRIGHTENING SLOPES AND STEEPS
IT'S THAT LITTLE MOOSE-CRITTER WHAT'S JEST SEEN US THROUGH AN I GUESS WE'LL SEE HER THROUGH TOO JACKSON AN ME HIS TONE AND MANNER WERE CIVILITY ITSELF BUT HIS BIG LEAN FIST WAS CLENCHED TILL THE KNUCKLES WENT WHITE
IT LIFTED THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN SUDDENLY AND HE HALF FELL ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT--THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET--WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
SHE FELL IN HER TRACKS A HEAP OF HUDDLED FUR AND GRINNING TEETH
FOR THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THEY MIGHT BE THINKING HE HAD COME TO ROB THEIR NESTS
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE HIS RIVAL BEING APPARENTLY TOO BUSY TO HEED HIM
AS HE DID SO THERE WAS A SHARP MOVEMENT ON THE PLATFORM OF STICKS AND A KEEN DEFIANT EYE LOOKED UP AT HIM
AFTER CLIMBING ALL THE MORNING HE HAD FAILED TO GAIN ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT BROWN RAM
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE ON HIS PART CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HAWK AND DROPPED LIKE LEAD INTO THE TORRENT
AND IT SEEMED TO BE HUNTING IN A LEISURELY FASHION AS IF WELL FED AND SEEKING EXCITEMENT RATHER THAN A MEAL
A MURMUR OF SATISFACTION WENT ROUND THE TABLE AND KNIVES ONCE MORE CLATTERED ON TIN PLATES
THEN HIS SAVAGE JAWS STRETCHED WIDE IN A CHOKING SCREECH AS THE STEEL TALONS CLOSED INEXORABLY ON HIS THROAT AND HIS SLIM LOINS AND THE FIERY LIGHT IN HIS BRAIN WENT OUT IN A FLAME OF INDIGNATION AMAZED THAT IT IN TURN SHOULD SUFFER THE FATE WHICH IT HAD SO CONTINUALLY AND SO IMPLACABLY INFLICTED
BUT HE COULD SEE NO RESULT OF THE SHOT
BUT IT WAS NOT HELD AMONG THE TRIBE TO BE ANY UNACCOUNTABLE OR DREADFUL THING THAT THE BOY SHOULD BE THUS COMPASSED ABOUT WITH MYSTERY FOR THIS WAS THE TRIBE OF THE NASQUAPEES THE WIZARDS WHO WERE ALL MYSTICS AND CREDITED WITH SECRET POWERS
BUT EVEN AS HE WAS WEIGHING THE CHANCES OF IT THE DUSK GATHERED AND THE WOLVES BEGAN TO SHOW THEMSELVES ALONG THE SKIRTS OF THE TIMBER
HAD HE TAKEN SUCH A PRIZE HE COULD NOT HAVE PROFITED BY IT HAVING NO MEANS OF TEARING IT TO PIECES
IT WAS A LITTLE FIRE A TRUE INDIAN'S FIRE ECONOMICAL OF FUEL
HERE BROWN BULL WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A TRESPASSER
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF HOWEVER WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS MYSTERY ENOUGH FOR THE MOST EXACTING IN THE MERE EXISTENCE OF THIS DEEP AND BRIMMING TARN ON THE CREST OF A GRANITE PEAK
HE PICKED UP HIS THREE-LEGGED STOOL HITCHED HIMSELF UNDER THE FLANK OF THE NEAREST COW GRIPPED A PAIL BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND IN A MOMENT BEGAN THE SOFT FROTHY THUNDER OF THE TWO WHITE STREAMS PULSATING DOWN ALTERNATELY INTO THE TIN UNDER THE RHYTHMIC PERSUASION OF HIS SKILLED FINGERS
SHE HAD ONLY SIX MORE AND SHE BEGAN TO REPENT OF HAVING USED THE OTHERS SO RECKLESSLY
THEY WERE NOT FEEDING
THEN AT LAST URGED BY A RUTHLESS HUNGER AND SORROWFULLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HE COULD DO FOR JABE OR JABE FOR HIM HE SET OFF AGAIN ON HIS WANDERINGS
NOW HE HAD IT HE DID NOT HURRY
A YEARLING HEIFER OF JABE SMITH'S WHICH HAD ESCAPED FROM THE FIRE AND FLED FAR INTO THE WILDERNESS CHANCED TO FIND HER WAY BACK
THE DOOR BEGAN TO CREAK MORE AND MORE VIOLENTLY
BUT OF JUST ONE THING HE SEEMED SOMEWHAT UNSURE
HE STEERED A LONG CURVE AROUND THE EDGE OF THE SHINING POOL GATHERED HIS LEGS UNDER HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT JUMP CLEAR IF NECESSARY AND CAME TO A STOP WITH HIS VACILLATING PROPELLER ALMOST PEERING OVER THE ABYSS
AS WOULD NATURALLY BE SUPPOSED MARY BEING A MEMBER OF THE FIRM HAD THE FREE RUN OF THE CABIN AND SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME THEREIN ESPECIALLY AT MEALS OR IN BAD WEATHER
ONCE FAIRLY A-WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
THAT A LYNX SHOULD BE ABLE TO CAUSE HIM A MOMENT'S APPREHENSION
THIS WAS A TRESPASS UPON HIS OWN PRESERVES--A POINT IN REGARD TO WHICH THE GRIZZLY IS APT TO BE SENSITIVE
AT SUCH TIME JABE SMITH WAS USUALLY TO BE SEEN SMOKING CONTEMPLATIVELY ON THE WOODPILE AND REGARDING THE ABASHED FUGITIVES WITH SYMPATHY
THIS WAS TOO MUCH
HIS EYES FLAMED GREEN WITH INDIGNATION AS HE WATCHED HER TRYING TO STEAL THE PRIZE WHICH HE HAD ALREADY MARKED DOWN FOR HIS OWN
AND SOON BEING ASSIDUOUSLY LICKED AND FONDLED AND NURSED TILL HIS LITTLE BELLY WAS ROUND AS A MELON HE FORGOT THE CAVE ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE AND ACCEPTED JABE SMITH'S BARN AS A QUITE NORMAL ABODE FOR SMALL BEARS
GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER HE SAW A GRAYISH PATCH MOVING SWIFTLY UNDER THE SHIFTING RADIANCE
FREQUENTLY ONE OR ANOTHER WOULD FLASH OUT THROUGH THE NARROW EXIT TO HUNT AND TEST ITS STRENGTH IN THE BRIGHT TURMOIL OF THE RAPIDS
IT WAS IN ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE MELANCHOLY VISITS THAT WOOF FIRST ENCOUNTERED A MALE OF HIS OWN SPECIES AND SHOWED HOW FAR HE WAS FROM ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF KINSHIP
THEY HAD THEIR CHEER OF ASSOCIATION IN THE SNUG BURROWS DEEP BENEATH THE COVERING OF THE SNOWS
AND THE WHOLE HOST WITH SUDDEN RISING RAGE CHARGED WITH THEM
I SURE DID HAVE THE CREEPS HE EXPLAINED TO THE CAT WHICH OPENED ONE EYE AT HIM AND SHUT IT AGAIN NONCOMMITTALLY
AT THIS SIGHT THE BEAR STOPPED ALSO HIS WRATH NOT BEING YET QUITE HOT ENOUGH TO CONSUME HIS CURIOSITY
BEFORE HE HAD GONE HALF A MILE WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT SAW THE TRAIL OF THE PACK DIVIDE AND SEEK THE COVERTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TRACK OF THE LONELY SNOWSHOER
HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW-TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
IT BEING TOO LATE IN THE YEAR TO BEGIN REBUILDING THE WOODSMAN HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF TO THE SETTLEMENTS FOR THE WINTER TRUSTING TO BEGIN IN THE SPRING THE SLOW REPAIR OF HIS FORTUNES
LONG JACKSON WAS FIRST TO CALL FOR A HALT
HE PICKED HIS WAY DAINTILY OVER THE WIDE BEDS OF MOIST SPHAGNUM MAKING NO MORE SOUND AS HE WENT THAN IF HIS FEET HAD BEEN OF THISTLEDOWN
BUT BROWN BULL WAS NOT UNDULY ELATED BY THIS RESPITE
ALSO HE BROKE POOR JINNY AT ONCE OF HER AFFECTIONATE HABIT OF SPRINGING UP AND PLANTING HER FOREPAWS UPON HIS BREAST
THEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD TOWARD THE WALL OF THE WIGWAM WEARILY AND WITH A SHARP SIGH HER SPIRIT PASSED FROM HER LIPS HURRYING OUT OVER THE BLACK SPRUCE RIDGES AND BARREN HILLS TO SEEK THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS OF HER FATHERS
HE WOULD MAKE A HASTY OBSERVATION FIRST THEN CIRCLE AROUND AND EFFECT A LANDING IF THE SURFACE LOOKED SMOOTH ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ATTEMPT IT WITHOUT TOO MUCH RISK
THE TROUT SEEMED TO BE FORGOTTEN
IT WAS AS IF THE TOUCH OF THAT SHADOW HAD LOOSED A POWERFUL SPRING
HE LAUGHED IMPATIENTLY AND GAVE NO FURTHER HEED TO IT
THEN IN A FLASH HIS WITS CAME BACK TO HIM
WITH A VIEW TO STARTLING SOME WARY HIDERS INTO ACTIVITY HE OPENED HIS BEAK AND GAVE UTTERANCE TO AN UNEARTHLY SCREECHING HOOT
JOHN HATCH HAD TWO COWS AND A YOKE OF RED STEERS
ALL AROUND THE FAR-FLUNG OUTSKIRTS OF THE HOST RAN SKULKING AND DODGING ITS ACCUSTOMED HEREDITARY FOES--THE LITTLE SLIM YELLOW-GRAY COYOTES AND THE GAUNT TIMBER WOLVES
AN IT MAKES THE CAMP A SIGHT HOMIER HAVIN SOMETHIN LIKE A CAT OR A DAWG ABOUT RIGHT YOU ARE AGREED THE BOSS
THE MORE HE STUDIED THAT LOW SINEWY DARK FIGURE WITH ITS KEEN TEETH AND PUNISHING JAW THE LESS HE LIKED IT AND THE MORE INDIFFERENT HE GREW TO THE ATTRACTIONS OF TROUT AS A DIET
THE LYNX AS A FISHERMAN WAS BOTH HOPEFUL AND PATIENT
WOOF'S HEART BOUNDED HOPEFULLY
SHE HAD A GLIMPSE OF SMALL SAVAGE EYES AND AN OPEN WHITE-FANGED MOUTH
WITH A GASP HE TWISTED HIMSELF CLEAR OF HIS HARNESS AND SPRANG FORWARD
IN THIS PEN SHE WAS SAFE BUT NOT ALWAYS QUITE HAPPY
AT THE HEIGHT WHICH HE HAD NOW GAINED THE AIR WAS ICY COLD BUT STILL AS A DREAM
AT A DISTANCE OF HALF-A-DOZEN FEET HOWEVER HE PAUSED AS IF THAT PALE MENACING STARE OF HIS CROUCHING ADVERSARY HAD DISCONCERTED HIM
THEY WERE BIG-BONED BIG-HEARTED CHILDREN THESE MEN OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK LUMBER CAMPS QUICK IN QUARREL QUICK IN SENTIMENT BUT COOL AND CLOSE-LIPPED IN THE FACE OF EMERGENCY
WITH A BLEAT OF TERROR SHE SPRANG BACK UP THE CROSS-GLADE
BUT DIRECTLY IN FRONT THE SIGHT OF THEM AROUSED THE LEADERS OF THE MARCH TO FURY
HE INFERRED AT ONCE THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE HIS FOES WERE NOW FORCED TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME IN FORAGING FOR THEIR OWN LIVELIHOOD AND HE DREW A WRY FACE OF SELF-DISGUST AS HE REALIZED THE DEPTH OF HIS RELIEF
WOOF HAD HOPED TO FIND JABE SMITH THERE
BESTRIDING HATCH'S BODY HE TURNED HIS HEAD WITH A SAVAGE SNARL
HE INCREASED HIS PACE HOPING TO FIND A SPOT WHERE HE MIGHT ENCAMP TO ADVANTAGE AND FORTIFY HIMSELF FOR THE NIGHT
AS HE REACHED THE NEAREST BURROW--IT WAS NOT HIS OWN--IT SEEMED AS IF THE DREADFUL SOUNDS WERE ALREADY OVERWHELMING HIM
THE CATS SCRATCHED HIM WHEN HE WAS LITTLE AND WITH EQUAL CONFIDENCE THEY SCRATCHED HIM WHEN HE WAS BIG
THEN HER BLOOD FROZE
THE SHADOWS AND JOHN HATCH WHEN JOHN HATCH FOUND THE LYNX KITTENS IN THEIR SHALLOW DEN ON THE BRIGHT AND WINDY SHOULDER OF OLD SUGAR LOAF HE STOOD FOR SOME MINUTES LOOKING DOWN UPON THEM WITH A WHIMSICAL MIXTURE OF COMPASSION AND HOSTILITY
HE EYED THE WAGON HE EYED THE HORSE BENEATH THE BIRCH TREE HE SCRUTINIZED THE WHOLE CLEARING THE ROAD AND THE OPEN STRETCH OF THE STREAM
THE LYNX ON THE OTHER HAND BEING LESS OBSTINATE AND OF MORE VARIABLE MOOD BEGAN TO THINK OF RABBITS AND SUCH LIKE EASY ENTERPRISES
THERE WAS NO MORE WIND BUT A CHILLY THROBBING BREATH
AS THE YEARS PASSED HOWEVER IT BEGAN TO APPEAR THAT THE OLD SQUAW'S FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS
SHE ASSURED HERSELF THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THAT NONE OF THE WILD INHABITANTS OF THESE NEW BRUNSWICK WOODS WOULD DARE TO INTERFERE WITH A HUMAN BEING
BUT THE VERY EFFICIENCY OF THEIR BODILY MACHINERY MADE THE DEMAND FOR FUEL COME ALL THE SOONER
HAVING ARRIVED OVER THE DEEPLY CLEFT AND RIDGED OUTWORKS OF BALD FACE THE AEROPLANE HAD PLUNGED INTO A VIEWLESS TURMOIL OF AIR-CURRENTS AND VORTICES
WHAT THE FOX WANTED WAS FISH NOT A FIGHT WITH AN ADVERSARY WHO WOULD GIVE HIM A LOT OF TROUBLE
THE PROBLEM WAS NOW TO FIX THE LATCH SO THAT IT COULD NOT AGAIN BE LIFTED FROM THE OUTSIDE
IMMEDIATELY OVER HIS OUTSTRETCHED GLEAMING HEAD FLEW THE HAWK
HE DID NOT TAKE TIME TO LOOK UP AND SEE WHAT IT WAS
BUT THE GRAY VISITOR TOOK NOTE OF THE DEADLY POSSIBILITIES OF THAT DARTING BILL AND PROMPTLY SAILED A LITTLE FURTHER OUT OF ITS RANGE
IT'D BE A DIRTY TRICK TO PUT A BALL INTO YEH HE MUTTERED SEEIN WHAT A HELL OF A HOLE YOU'VE JUST PULLED ME OUT OF THE POOL THE CURRENT THAT WENT CIRCLING THROUGH ITS DEPTHS KEEPING THEM ALWAYS CRYSTAL PURE AND SWEET WAS SO LEISURELY THAT THE CLEAR BROWN MIRROR OF THE SURFACE WAS NEVER BROKEN UNLESS BY SOME SLOW-WANDERING FOAM-CLUSTER EDDIED IN FROM THE FROTHY LITTLE FALLS OUTSIDE OR BY THE DROPPING OF A LEAF OR BY THE SLUGGISH RISE OF A TROUT TO SOME UNWARY SKIMMING FLY
THE MAN GRINNED INDULGENTLY AT THIS DISPLAY OF SPIRIT
THE OLD WOMAN SNATCHED UP THE CHILD LEST THE MOTHER'S SPIRIT IN PASSING SHOULD LURE IT AWAY WITH HER
ARRIVING AT THE ROCK HE THRUST THE LOADED TOBOGGAN CLOSE AGAINST ITS FOOT AND THEN AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TEN FEET BEFORE IT HE HASTENED TO START HIS FIRE
HE KEPT AN INDIGNANTLY WATCHFUL EYE ON ALL THE COVERTS HE PASSED AND HE SCRUTINIZED SUSPICIOUSLY EVERY CONSIDERABLE BOUGH THAT STRETCHED ACROSS THE TRAIL
HE DECIDED AT LENGTH UPON A THIN LUKEWARM GRUEL OF CORN-MEAL SLIGHTLY SALTED AND TRUSTED THAT THE STURDINESS OF THE MOOSE STOMACH MIGHT SURVIVE SUCH A VIOLENT CHANGE OF DIET
HE CALCULATED TO OVERTAKE THE CHASE AT ANY MOMENT
SHE GREW WARM AND COMFORTABLE AND FINALLY OPENING HER BUNDLE SHE GOT OUT A PACKAGE OF NEGLECTED SANDWICHES AND MADE A CONTENTED MEAL
BUT A LITTLE CHOKING WAS OF SMALL CONSEQUENCE IN VIEW OF HIS HEROIC APPETITE AND AFTER MANY AN UNDIGNIFIED PAROXYSM HE ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK
TWO BY CHANCE DRIFTED UPON A LIP OF ROCK WHERE THEY SPRAWLED HALF-AWASH AND WERE PRESENTLY DEAD OF THE CHILL
ALL THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE WINTER THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGN OF A WOLF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE TRAIL OF THE WANDERING CARIBOU HAVING LURED THEM FAR TO THE EASTWARD
ON THE OUTERMOST EDGE OF THE RIGHT OR WESTERN WING OF THE BELLOWING HOST WENT A COMPACT LITTLE HERD WHICH HUNG TOGETHER WITH MARKED OBSTINACY
I RECKON THERE'LL BE NO MORE SHADDERS COME SNEAKIN ALONG OUR TRAIL AFTER THIS AN THANKS TO YOU THE FISHER IN THE CHUTES HE WAS PLAINLY A DUCK
FOR THIS GIFT OF VISION THE BOOK WILL BE READ A VISION WITH ITS REMINDER OF THE SCENT OF DARK FORESTS OF FIR THE AWFUL AND MAJESTIC LONELINESS OF SKY-TOWERING PEAKS THE ROAR OF THE BREAKERS AND SALTY SMELL OF THE SEA THE WHISPERING SILENCES OF THE FORESTS
IT PUZZLED HIM GREATLY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MINK IN THE BASKET
INSTEAD OF THAT HE CAME ONLY HALF-WAY OVER THE THRESHOLD AND STOOD THERE MAKING THOSE VIOLENT CONTORTIONS WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE WAGGING HIS TAIL
FOR ALL HIS BULK HE WENT AS NOISELESSLY AS A WILD-CAT SKIRTING THE OPEN SPACES AND STOPPING FROM TIME TO TIME TO SIT UP MOTIONLESS AS A STUMP AND LISTEN INTENTLY AND SNIFF THE AIR WITH SENSITIVE NOSTRILS
HE'LL FETCH YER LARRIGANS AN SOCKS AN THINGS FER YE
IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT THE CALF HAD ANY CLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE OR EVEN OF BRANNIGAN'S BACKWOODS VARIANT OF IT
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM HIS DIRECTION THAT THE TRAVELER CAME FROM THE LODGES ON THE MICHIKAMAW
IF YE'RE SATISFIED I MUST BE
HE DOUBLED LITHELY ASIDE AND SPRANG AGAIN SEEKING TO RECOVER HIS FORMER ADVANTAGE
SOME PROWLED FORTH AND SLIPPED BACK AGAIN AT ONCE INTO THE GLOOM WHILE OTHERS CAME OUT AND STOOD EYEING HIM STEADILY
AT FIRST HE PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT HIS OBJECT IN THIS WAS MERELY TO SAVE TIME
AN FIND YE IN COLD STORAGE LONG
THE EXTREME SUMMIT OF BALD FACE WAS A LEVEL PLATEAU OF GRANITE SOME DOZEN OF ACRES IN EXTENT WITH A NEEDLE-LIKE PINNACLE OF SPLINTERED GRANITE AT ITS EASTERN OR SEAWARD END
HE CRAWLED INTO THE HOLE CURLED UP ON THE SOFT DEAD GRASS OF THE DEVASTATED NEST AND COSILY WENT TO SLEEP
WHEN WINTER SETTLED DOWN UPON THE WILDERNESS IT DID SO WITH A RIGOR INTENDED TO MAKE UP FOR SEVERAL MILD SEASONS
AN INTRUDER A STRANGER A RIVAL WHOSE SKILL AS A FISHERMAN MADE HIS OWN ATTEMPTS SEEM NOTHING WORTH HAD ARRIVED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE POOL AND WAS PEERING DOWN INTO IT WITH KEEN EYES
THE CYCLONE CAUGHT THE HINDER SECTION OF THE HOST DIAGONALLY WHIRLED IT INTO THE AIR LIKE SO MANY BROWN LEAVES AND BORE IT ONWARD TO BE STREWN IN HIDEOUS FRAGMENTS OVER THE PLAIN BEHIND
AS LONG AS HIS BODY WAS COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IT WAS AT THE MERCY OF THE TWISTING AND TORTURED CURRENTS WHICH ROLLED HIM OVER AND OVER IN SPITE OF HIS SWIMMING CRAFT
FEELING HIMSELF SO CHOSEN HE FLASHED FRANTICALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND UP AND DOWN EVER MISSING THE EXIT--OR CLEVERLY HEADED OFF FROM IT--BUT ALSO FOR SOME MINUTES EVADING THE INEXORABLE PURSUIT
IN WARM WEATHER HIS ENDURANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DOUBT EQUAL TO BRANNIGAN'S
AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THIS PARTICULAR PANTHER WAS NOT GOING TO PLAY BY THE ACCEPTED RULES OF THE GAME OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO AUDACIOUS AS TO REVEAL HIMSELF EVEN FOR THAT INSTANT IN THE OPEN TRAIL
AND ALL THE TIME THE HERON HER HEAD DRAWN BACK BETWEEN HER HUNCHED SHOULDERS WATCHED HIS FLIGHT UNWINKINGLY AND KEPT HER MENACING POINT AT GUARD
HUGELY SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF BRANNIGAN STRODE FORTH FROM HIS HIDING AND EXAMINED HIS DOUBLE PRIZE
AT LAST THE SWIMMER CAME TO THE BROKEN WATER AND PLUNGED INTO IT
IF WE DON'T HEV A FIRE WE'LL FREEZE WITH NOTHIN IN OUR STOMMICKS NARY MATCH YET SAID JACKSON DOGGEDLY
EVEN HIS SAGACIOUS AND PENETRATING VISION COULD BARELY MAKE OUT THAT A MAN HAD STEPPED FORTH FROM UNDER THE TENT-FLAP AND NOW STOOD MOTIONLESS BESIDE IT
MARY'S JEST AS MUCH MY PARDNER AS SHE IS YOURN AN I AIN'T NO CANNIBAL
BY ALL MEANS LET THE MINK STAY IN THERE
AN I'VE GOT TWO MATCHES JEST TWO MIND YER
HIS GRAY EYES UNDER THEIR SHAGGY BROWS BLAZED WITH EXCITEMENT
THIS ERE'S MY SHINDY LONG HE ANSWERED DOGGEDLY
HE STOOD UP AND STARED LONG AT THE BODY OF THE GREAT BEAST WHOM HE HAD SLAIN
THE THIRD DAY AFTER MACCREEDY'S ARRIVAL AT X WAS WINDLESS AND WITHOUT A CLOUD IN THE BLUE
A GLANCING BLOW OF THE STRANGER'S HOWEVER ON THE SIDE OF WOOF'S SNOUT--ONLY THE REMNANT OF A SPENT STROKE BUT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT ON THAT MOST SENSITIVE CENTER OF A BEAR'S DIGNITY--AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE DUEL
IMMEDIATELY THE EAGLES WERE ALL ABOUT HIM
IN THE OPEN BACK OF THE WAGON THRUST WELL UNDER THE SEAT TO BE IN THE SHADE LAY A LARGE WICKER FISHING-BASKET WITH A TUFT OF GRASS STICKING OUT THROUGH THE SQUARE HOLE IN THE COVER
LONG JACKSON BY THE DOOR HESITATED AND GLARED PIERCINGLY AT THE BOSS WHO REFRAINED FROM NOTICING
AT THIS RATE SHE WOULD BE IN THE FOREST ALL NIGHT FOR IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRAVERSE THE BOG-HOLES IN THE DARK
THEY HAD MAULED AND BEATEN HIM ONCE BEFORE
COIN'S BEEN TOO HEAVY
ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE SKIRTS OF THE CLOSE GROWTH STOOD A SINGLE SMALL SPRUCE
BUT AGAINST AN ENEMY WHOM HE HAD LEARNED TO RESPECT THE INDIAN HUNTERS HE KEPT AN UNTIRING WATCH AND THE FEW WHITE HUNTERS WHO HAD ALREADY SO THINNED THE BISON HOST HE REMEMBERED WITH A FEAR WHICH WAS MINGLED WITH VENGEFUL RESENTMENT
THEN HE FELL TO SHOUTING AND YELLING FOR HELP
IN TWO MINUTES A DOZEN ANGRY FOXES WERE OUT AND CREEPING THROUGH THE STORM
THERE CAME NOW A DAY OF INTENSE AND HEAVY HEAT WITH SOMETHING IN THE AIR WHICH MADE THE WHOLE HOST UNEASY
THE MANEUVER WAS ALMOST EQUALLY DISASTROUS TO MCLAGGAN WHO ROCKING WITH LAUGHTER ALL BUT FELL OUT OF HIS TREE
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL EASY SHOT THE TARGET ISOLATED AND FRAMED IN GREEN
AT THEIR APPROACH IT BACKED OFF A DOZEN YARDS OR SO TO THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES AND STOOD GAZING AT THEM WITH SOFT ANXIOUS EYES
PRESENTLY THE OTTER MADE A LITTLE RUSH IN AS IF TO SEIZE IT
HE HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS KILL
WITH UNPRINTABLE REMARKS THEY LEAPT FROM THEIR BUNKS INTO A SCORCHING SMOTHER OF SMOKE SNATCHED UP INSTINCTIVELY THEIR THICK COATS AND WELL-GREASED LARRIGANS FUMBLED FRANTICALLY FOR THE LATCH AND BURST OUT INTO THE ICY BLESSED AIR
BUT THE FOLLOWING DAY BROUGHT OTHERS AND FOR A WEEK OR MORE THERE WAS NEVER A DAY WITHOUT THIS HARASSING ATTACK UPON ONE FLANK OR ANOTHER OF THE HOST OR SOMETIMES UPON BOTH FLANKS AT ONCE
HE HAD BEEN BUSY GETTING HIS GUN
WHEN HE DID NOTICE IT HE LOOKED UP SHARPLY HIS BEAK DRIPPING HIS ROUND PALLID FACE DAPPLED WITH BLOOD
KNOWING WELL THAT THE BEAST WOULD NEVER DARE TO SPRING UPON HIM HE SPAT UPON THE GROUND IN IRRITATED CONTEMPT
WHAT WAS THE CHILL AND LONELY WILDERNESS TO HIM A DOG
IN NEW BRUNSWICK HE HAD BEEN A HUNTER AND GUIDE
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT FORGOT THE SLAIN WOLF
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD COME PRETTY QUICK FATHER SAID THE SMALL VOICE TREMBLINGLY FOR I'D BEEN CALLING YOU EVER SO LONG A LITTLE FACE MEAGER AND BURNING-EYED WAS GAZING AT HIM TRUSTFULLY FROM AMONG THE FURS IN THE SLEDGE
HIS COURAGE WAS SOUND BUT HIS NERVES WERE JUMPY
HASTILY DEPOSITING HER BURDEN THE NEWCOMER FLAPPED UPWARD AND AROUND TO THE EAST TILL SHE TOO CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE MOUNTING MONOPLANE
THE MATING DUCKS CLAMORED HARSHLY ALONG THE BRIGHT COILS OF THE SLUGGISH STREAM WHICH WOUND ITS WAY THROUGH THE MARSHES
THE ONLY SOUND ON THE INTENSE STILLNESS WAS THE SLOW GRIND OF HER RUMINATING JAWS AND THE DEEP BREATHING OF THE TWO EXHAUSTED MEN
HE NO LONGER HEEDED THE FLIES OR THE HEAT AND WHEN THE SWEAT STREAMED DOWN INTO HIS EYES HE MERELY WIPED THEM CHEERFULLY ON HIS SLEEVE
AND JUST AS THE BEAR REACHED THE PLACE WHERE SHE HAD BEEN STANDING THE SPRUCE TIPS SPARKED SHARPLY AND FLARED UP IN HIS FACE
APPEARING TO REGARD IT AS PART OF MCLAGGAN HE FELL UPON IT TRIUMPHANTLY
WHAT'LL YE TAKE BRANNIGAN SAW THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS A SERIOUS ONE AND HIS FACE STIFFENED
BROWN BULL AND HIS HERD WERE IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FRONT RANK AT THIS POINT
BUT ITS ELEVATION WAS ENOUGH TO SECURE IT GOOD DRAINAGE AND A GROWTH OF MORE VARIED HERB AND BUSH THAN THAT OF THE MOSS-COVERED TUNDRA WITH HERE AND THERE A LITTLE OPEN SPACE OF TURF AND REAL GRASS WHICH AFFORDED ITS TENANTS ROOM TO BASK DELICIOUSLY IN THE GLOW OF THE PRECIPITATE SUMMER
AND EACH HAS TOO MUCH AT STAKE
THE MIGHTIER THEIR MYRIADS THE MORE IRRESISTIBLE THE INVITATION TO THIS RELENTLESS SLAUGHTERER
HE HURRIED ALONG DOWN THE TRAIL
HE PICTURED HIM EVEN NOW TURNING WEARILY AT BAY HIS BACK TO SOME ROCK OR STEEP HILLOCK HIS LOADED SLEDGE UPTILTED BEFORE HIM AS A BARRICADE AND THE WOLVES CROWDING THE THICKETS ON EITHER SIDE WAITING FOR THE MOMENT TO RUSH IN UPON HIM
HE FELT THAT IT HAD BEEN RATHER MORE OF A CLOSE CALL THAN IT APPEARED
SUDDENLY HE SWOOPED AGAIN
AT THIS KINDLY TIME OF YEAR THEY ALL STAYED OUT AT PASTURE DAY AND NIGHT WITH THE SHEEP IN THE UPPER BURNT LOT--A RAGGED FIELD OF HILLOCKS AND SHORT SWEET GRASS AND FIRE-BLACKENED STUMPS SLOWLY ROTTING
HE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE HIS PARTNER HAD VOICED A THOUGHT WHICH HE HAD BEEN AT PAINS TO BANISH FROM HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT IT WAS THE TROUT THAT CHIEFLY CONCERNED HIM
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
BUT HER SATISFACTION WAS OF BRIEF LIFE
HE FELT THE LURE OF A SPLENDID AND UNKNOWN QUARRY
THIS HE DID VERY SAGACIOUSLY BY CULTIVATING THE COMPANIONSHIP OF HIS KIND
SITTING ON THE WOOD SLED AT A SAFE DISTANCE JEFF WATCHED THE CHOPPING WITH ALERT INTEREST WHILE THE OLD SORREL DREAMED WITH DROOPING HEAD AND STEAMED IN THE DRY FROST
HER OWN GREAT TRACKS ON THE TRAIL HAD BEEN OBLITERATED THAT MORNING BY A SOFT AND THAWING FALL OF BELATED SPRING SNOW--"THE ROBIN SNOW AS IT IS CALLED IN NEW BRUNSWICK--AND THE MAN ABSORBED IN PICKING HIS WAY BY THIS UNFAMILIAR ROUTE OVER THE MOUNTAIN HAD NO SUSPICION THAT HE WAS IN DANGER OF TRESPASSING
AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE FROM HIS READING WHICH WAS EXTENSIVE THIS SMOOTH FLAT GRANITE TOP OF BALD FACE WITH ITS LITTLE PINNACLE AT ONE END AND ITS DEEP TRANSPARENT TARN IN THE CENTER WAS UNLIKE ANY OTHER KNOWN SUMMIT IN THE WORLD
BUT SLEEP WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF
IT WOULD DO HIM NO GOOD TO HAVE KILLING IN THE CAMP EVEN IF HE WERE NOT HIMSELF THE VICTIM
HE PLOUGHED DOWN CHUTES AND FUNNELS OF LOOSE STONE THE DEBRIS OF THE ROCK WALLS ABOVE
SOMETIMES IT WAS A FLY OR A MOTH OR A CATERPILLAR OR SOME EDIBLE BERRY
THAT ACCOUNTS FER HER KIND OF HASTY WAYS
THE GRAY VISITOR DROPPED IN A HEAP WITH THE JAVELIN BILL CLEAN THROUGH HIS THROAT
HE SAW THE GREAT HAWK SWOOP SAVAGELY
AND SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF WEANING HIM TILL HE HIMSELF DECIDED THE MATTER BY PREFERRING THE SOLID DAINTIES OF THE KITCHEN
TIP-TOEING CAUTIOUSLY AROUND IT HE SAW THAT THE LID WAS SLIGHTLY OPEN SO THAT THE MINK COULD COME OUT IF HE WISHED
BUT IF SO SHE WAS IN HIS EYES A DOG OF INCOMPARABLE CHARM MORE DEAR TO HIM THOUGH A NEW ACQUAINTANCE THAN EVEN LITTLE BROWN JINNY HIS KIND MOTHER HAD EVER BEEN
HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD GET OFF AS DIRECTLY AND SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE AND BY WAY OF THE NORTHWEST FRONT
IT BEGAN TO LOOK AS IF IN SPITE OF FATE A MIGHTY REMNANT WOULD YET MAKE GOOD ITS WAY INTO THE BROKEN COUNTRY DANGEROUS WITH HOSTILE INDIANS WHITHER THE WHITE HUNTERS WOULD HESITATE TO PURSUE
AS JACKSON WAS WONT TO SAY SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT SHE HAD A GREAT HEAD WHEN IT CAME TO CHOOSING HER FRIENDS
BUT HE WAS EVIDENTLY A LITTLE TIRED FOR HE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO REACH MCLAGGAN'S REFUGE
THE EAGLE HATED MAN BECAUSE MAN WAS THE ONLY CREATURE THAT HAD EVER GIVEN HIM HITHERTO THE LOATHED SENSATION OF FEAR
THE ASSAULT OF WINGS IN HIS HIGH PLACE IN THE UNCLOUDED BLUE A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE TOPMOST PINNACLE OF BALD FACE THE GREAT WHITE-HEADED EAGLE STARED DOWNWARD TOWARD THE FAR-OFF REEK AND ROOFS OF THE BUSY TOWN BY THE SEA
AS HE GNAWED LUXURIOUSLY AT THE SILVER-AND-BUFF VERMILION-SPOTTED TIT-BIT AN IMMENSE SHADOW FLOATED BETWEEN HIM AND THE SUN
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WOODS THAT HE HAD NEED TO FEAR
THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE MORNING
FOR JABE THOUGH COMPASSIONATE OF HEART HAD WISELY DECIDED THAT COMPASSION WOULD BE TOO COSTLY AT THE PRICE OF HAVING HIS LITTLE CLEARING QUITE OVERRUN WITH DOGS
BUT THE COOK OF CONROY'S CAMP WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND HE WAS NOT A COOL OBSERVER--IN FACT HE WAS FRIGHTENED
HE REALIZED SUDDENLY THAT IN THE TEMPER OF HIS VISITORS WAS A RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD BALK AT NOTHING
BUT THAT IF KEPT HIM PRUDENT
HE TRIED IT THEN STOPPED TO LISTEN FOR AN ANSWER
THE PATH OF MIGRATION--THE OLD PATH KNOWN TO THE ANCESTORS OF THIS HOST FOR MANY GENERATIONS--NOW LED FOR MANY DAYS ALONG THE RIGHT BANK OF A WIDE AND TURBULENT BUT USUALLY SHALLOW RIVER
HE WAS NOT NERVOUS AS WE HAVE SEEN BUT HE WAS ANNOYED THAT HE THE OLD TRAILER OF MANY BEASTS SHOULD THUS BE TRAILED IN HIS TURN FROM WHATEVER MOTIVE
MARY INDEED COULD NOT ENDURE IT SO SHE STAYED OUTSIDE
HE DID NOT EVEN HAVE TO HELP HIS MATE OCCUPIED THOUGH SHE WAS IN A LEISURELY WAY WITH THE CARE OF HER CUBS
LET'S FIX THE RED VARMINTS
THAT IS HIS NAME SHE MUTTERED
WHEN THIS ATTEMPT PROVED FUTILE HE FELL TO ROOTING AND PRODDING THE GROUND TILL THE STICKINESS HAD GATHERED A COPIOUS TRIBUTE OF LEAVES AND TWIGS AND DIRT
INDEED HIS VARIOUS STUDIES OF WILD LIFE IN GENERAL WHETHER CAST IN THE WORLD OF SHORT SKETCH OR STORY OR FULL-LENGTH NARRATIVE HAVE ALWAYS SECURED AN INTERESTED PUBLIC
BUT SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SLEEP INDOORS BECAUSE BRANNIGAN WAS CONVINCED THAT SUCH A PRACTICE WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR HER HEALTH
AN APPALLING HUM AS OF GIANT WIRES DROWNED THE THUNDER OF THE GALLOPING HOST
SHE SAW A MAN--A WOODSMAN IN BROWNISH-GREY HOMESPUNS AND HEAVY LEG-BOOTS AND WITH A GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER--SLOUCHING UP ALONG THE FAINTLY MARKED TRAIL WHICH LED CLOSE PAST HER DOORWAY
FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER THERE WERE NONE OF THESE HUMAN ENEMIES NEAR AND THE HOST ROLLED ON SOUTHWARD WITH ITS BELLOWINGS AND ITS TRAMPLINGS UNMOLESTED
BUT WITH ALL ITS COURAGE IT DID NOT DARE ATTACK ANY ONE OF THE CALMLY WATCHFUL FOXES
THEY TURNED THEIR BACKS RESOLUTELY AND HEADED OFF THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE SNOW TOWARD CONROY'S CAMP MANY FROZEN LEAGUES TO THE SOUTH-EASTWARD
SOME WAY UP THE SHORE THERE WAS A MAN AT THE WATER'S EDGE FISHING
THE TEMPTATION OF THE NEW GRASS WAS ONE NOT TO BE RESISTED BUT THE PRICE OF IT WAS AN UNSLEEPING WATCHFULNESS OF EYE AND EAR AND WITS
THERE WAS A CHOKED SQUEAL AND THE RAT LAY MOTIONLESS UNDER THE TALONS OF A MOTTLE BROWN MARSH-HAWK WHICH FELL INSTANTLY TO TEARING ITS VICTIM AS IF OBLIGED TO LUNCH IN A HURRY
THE ISLAND WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH OR DEFINED ENOUGH TO BE CALLED A KNOLL
BUT WHEN HE CAME DOWN THE OTTER'S BACK WAS NO LONGER WHERE HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE
TO HIM IT HAD COME AS A VOICE FROM THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF FRIENDLINESS AND PLENTY AND IMPETUOUS BROOMS AND HE HAD HASTENED TOWARD THE SOUND WITH NEW HOPE IN HIS HEART
THE REST OF THE FARMYARD FOLK ACCEPTED HIM AT HIS OWN ILLUSION AND APPEARED TO REGARD HIM AS A GIGANTIC SPECIES OF DOG
AND THEN HER IDEA OF THE DIRECTION OF CONROY'S CAMP SEEMED QUITE UNFORMED
IN RESPONSE THE OTTER DISCREETLY DREW BACK A FEW FEET
AND MOST OF THE FISH--TROUT SALMON GRILSE OR PARR--WHICH JOURNEYED UP AND DOWN EITHER THE FORK OR THE PARENT RIVER CHOSE TO PASS THROUGH THAT SLUICE OF SWIFT BUT UNBROKEN FLOW IMMEDIATELY BENEATH THE OVERHANGING BRANCH ON WHICH HE PERCHED
THE SHAMBLES OF THE PLAIN THE THREE WHITE MEN TURNED TO FLEE BEFORE THE TORRENT OF DEATH
BUT SHE WAITED IN A SORT OF HORROR EXPECTING MOMENTLY THAT A DREADFUL SHADOWY FACE WOULD DARKEN ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM AND GLARE IN UPON HER
FOR SHE BELIEVED IT WAS THE WHITE WOLF NOT THE WIND WHO HAD SPOKEN IN THAT HOUR AND SHE TREMBLED LEST THE CHILD SHOULD COME UNDER HIS BAN
HIS SNUG BURROW BENEATH THE STUNTED BUSH-GROWTH OF THE PLAINS WAS SURROUNDED BY THE BURROWS OF PERHAPS A SCORE OF HIS RACE
IT WAS A SOUND PROPOSITION
JUST AS THE GNASHING JAWS WERE ABOUT TO SNAP UPON THE VICTIM'S NECK SOMETHING NOT UNLIKE THE STROKE OF A PILE-DRIVER CAUGHT THE WOLF FAIRLY ON THE CRUPPER
POWERFUL ENOUGH ALONE TO PULL DOWN A YEARLING CALF THEY WERE ALWAYS WATCHED WITH SAVAGE AND APPREHENSIVE EYES BY THE COWS AND FORCED TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HIS EYES TROUBLED THEMSELVES TO TURN IN THAT DIRECTION FOR ALL HIS CONCERN WAS WITH THE INLAND LAKES AND WATERCOURSES WHICH LINKED THEMSELVES TRANQUILLY ABOUT THE SPREADING BASES OF OLD BALD FACE AND HE HATED THE ACRID SMOKECLOUDS WHICH ROSE FROM THE CHIMNEYS OF THE TOWN
HE BENT OVER THE SLEDGE AND CLUTCHED THE FRAIL FIGURE TO HIS BREAST TOO AMAZED TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS
OUT IN THE BARN IN THE SMELL OF HAY AND HORSES MARY LAY TRANQUILLY WAVING HER EARS STARING AT HER UNFAMILIAR COMPANY AND CHEWING HER COMFORTABLE CUD UNTROUBLED WITH ANY INTUITIONS OF THE FATE WHICH HAD TWICE WITHIN THE LAST FEW HOURS SO NARROWLY PASSED HER BY
HIS ADVERSARY SIMPLY WENT DOWN LIKE A RAG BABY BEFORE IT AND WAS MAULED TO ABJECT SUBMISSION IN THE SMOTHER OF THE SNOW INSIDE OF HALF A MINUTE
THE DOG WHO WAS NOT PERSONA GRATA TO THE COWS BECAUSE HE HAD AT TIMES TO REBUKE THEM FOR TRESPASSING ON THE OAT FIELD OR THE TURNIP PATCH SAT UP ON HIS HAUNCHES AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE AND WATCHED THE MILKING INDIFFERENTLY
HE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AND HEARD A SHARP DISCONCERTING RATTLE AS THE TAUT LINE RACED FROM THE REEL
THAT TRACK GREW MORE AND MORE IRRESOLUTE AND UNEVEN AND HE KNEW THAT THE FUGITIVE COULD NOT BE FAR AHEAD
IN SIMPLE FORCEFUL STYLE MR ROBERTS TAKES THE READER WITH HIM OUT INTO THE COLD DARK WOODS THROUGH BLIZZARDS STALKING GAME ENCOUNTERING ALL THE DANGERS OF THE BACKWOODSMEN'S LIFE AND ENJOYING THE CLOSE CONTACT WITH NATURE IN ALL HER MOODS
WITH A SCREAM HE DARTED OFF BENEATH A LOW-BRANCHED THICKET RAN LAMELY UP ANOTHER TREE AND CREPT AWAY FROM THE PLACE OF HIS DISCOMFITURE BY THE PATH OF THE INTERLACING BRANCHES
TUCKING HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS HE SLUNK OFF INTO THE UNDERBRUSH
BUT THE SWANS FROM THEIR ISLET AS THE FOXES FROM THEIR COLONY LOOKED ON WITH SILENT INDIFFERENCE
FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR OR MORE SHE HAD BEEN STRANGELY COMPANIONED
MCLAGGAN WANTED MEAT TO BE DRIED FOR HIS WINTER LARDER AND HE WANTED THE ANTLERS FOR A REALLY GOOD ELK HEAD WAS BY THIS TIME BECOME A THING OF PRICE
SHE SWUNG AROUND ON HER SEAT TO STARE WITH STRAINING EYES AT THE SPOT WHERE THE SOUND CAME FROM
THE LOOK WHICH HE KEPT UPON THE BASKET WAS NO LESS VIGILANT THAN BEFORE BUT THERE WAS NOW A TINGE OF SCORN IN IT
BUT ALL TO NO EFFECT
THE SKULKING COYOTES HE DISDAINED TO NOTICE
AT THE FIRST STRIDE A TOWERING BLACK FORM JAWS AGAPE AND CLAWS OUTSTRETCHED CRASHED PAST THE FIR BUSH AND HURLED ITSELF UPON HIM
THEY HAD KILLED THREE OF HIS SHEEP
AT DINNER BESIDE THE LONG PLANK TABLE BUILT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMP HE AND BRANNIGAN DEVOURED BOILED BEANS AND SALT PORK AND STEWED DRIED APPLES GULPED DOWN TINS OF BLACK TEA AND JOINTLY NARRATED THEIR EXPERIENCE TO THE INTERESTED CHOPPERS AND TEAMSTERS WHILE MARY SHUT UP IN THE STABLES MUNCHED HAY COMFORTABLY AND WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER PARTNERS
THE EAGLE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS FOR SOME MOMENTS OF A CURIOUS HUMMING ROAR IN HIS EARS THE SOURCE OF WHICH WAS NOT AT ONCE OBVIOUS TO HIM
HE TRIED TO TURN BACK TO THEM BUT THE PICTURE OF THE SPENT AND STUMBLING FUGITIVE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
A FEW YARDS FURTHER ON THE TORRENT FELL SEETHING OVER A LONG LEDGE INTO A POOL OF BRIEF QUIET
AND THE MAN PLEASED WITH HIS NEW PLAYTHING WENT GENTLY THAT HE MIGHT NOT DISTURB THE SLUMBER
ROBERTS AUTHOR OF KINGS IN EXILE THE BACKWOODSMEN ETC
THE POOL WAS PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS IN LENGTH
WITH A PANG OF SOLICITUDE HE THOUGHT OF THE COMELY AND KINDLY YOUNG SQUAW HIS WIFE AND OF THAT STRAIGHT-LIMBED COPPER-COLORED LITTLE FIVE-YEAR-OLD HIS SON WHOSE DARK EYES DANCED LIKE THE SUNLIGHT ON THE RIPPLES AND WHO WOULD ALWAYS RUN LAUGHING TO MEET HIM AND CLUTCH HIM BY THE KNEES SO STURDILY
AND AS FOR WOOF ONCE MORE HE THOUGHT OF JABE SMITH AND JINNY AND THE KIND FAMILIAR FARMYARD AND THE DELECTABLE SCRAPS FROM THE KITCHEN AND THE COMFORTING SMELL OF FRIED PANCAKES
HIS WIFE AND BOY AT LEAST WERE SHELTERED AND WITH THEIR PEOPLE ABOUT THEM AND WOULD NOT BE LEFT UTTERLY TO STARVE SO LONG AS THERE WAS A SHRED OF MEAT TO BE SHARED IN THE TRIBE
THEN CAME A DAY WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WANTED POLES
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD INSIST UPON BEING PROPELLED SIDEWAYS
THE MIDWINTER DARK FELL EARLY AND FELL WITH PECULIAR BLACKNESS ON JACKSON'S HALF-FAINTING EYES
THE FASTENING CAME UNDONE AND THE COVER FLOPPED HALF OPEN
HE TOOK NO PAINS TO CHOOSE AN EASY PATH THIS LIGHT-FOOT RUNNER OF THE AERIAL PEAKS
HE CHOKED BACK HIS WRATH AND CAST ABOUT FOR WORDS TO SAVE HIS FACE
AND SHE VALUES A COW MOOSE AT SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
YE AIN'T MUCH ACCOUNT NOW JEFF AND THE DOG FEELING THE REPROACH IN HATCH'S QUAINT SPEECH DROPPED HIS TAIL AND PRETENDED HE HAD BUSINESS BEHIND THE BARN
BUT BROWN BULL WITH HIS WIDER SAGACITY OR MORE SENSITIVE INTUITION SEEMED TO GROW ONLY THE MORE APPREHENSIVE AND THE MORE VIGILANT
ONE FROM EACH SIDE OF THE SPRUCE THICKET THEY CREPT STEALTHILY FORTH CROUCHING LOW THEIR EARS LAID BACK THEIR ROUND PALE EYES GLARING BOLDLY FROM THEIR ROUND GRAY CRUEL FACES
HE WAS MAKING HIS APPROACHES THEREFORE WITH A STEALTHY CRAFT SURPASSING THAT OF PETE ALLEN HIMSELF
BUT ALWAYS ONWARD THEY PRESSED THE SOUTH WITH ITS SUN-STEEPED PASTURES DRAWING THEM THE NORTH WITH ITS MENACE OF STORM DRIVING THEM BEFORE IT
THE BASKET DRAGGED THIS WAY AND THAT CAME PRESENTLY TO THE EDGE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND ON ITS BULGING SIDE
TO THE BIRD ON THE BASKET THE COMING OF THOSE VELVET FOOTSTEPS WERE LIKE THE SCAMPER OF A FRIGHTENED SHEEP
FLINGING DOWN THE WEAPON--AN OLD MUZZLE-LOADER WHICH THERE WAS NO TIME TO RECHARGE--HE REACHED BACK TO THE SLEDGE FOR HIS AXE
THE YELLING OF THE CYCLONE SANK AWAY AND THE RIVER COULD BE HEARD ONCE MORE BRAWLING OVER ITS REEFS AND BARS
AND ALL BEHIND AS USUAL FOLLOWED BLINDLY
BUT HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS NOT A GAME-WARDEN WITHIN AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILES OF THIS UNIMPORTANT AND LONELY LAKE AT THE HEAD OF THE OTTANOONSIS
IT JUST CLUNG WHERE IT WAS AND BEGAN TO POUR ITS CONTENTS DOWN IN A STICKY DELIBERATE STREAM ALL OVER HIS HEAD AND EARS AND FACE
IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN AND THE BOY HUNGRY IN THEIR WIGWAM ON THE MICHIKAMAW THAT MADE HIS HEART SINK
HE SNIFFED THE AIR BUT HIS NOSTRILS COULD DETECT NO TAINT UPON IT
ANOTHER THING THAT MCLAGGAN KNEW WAS THAT THE PANTHER HAS OCCASIONALLY A STRANGE TASTE FOR FOLLOWING A MAN IN SECRET WITH EXCESSIVE CAUTION BUT REMARKABLE PERSISTENCE AS IF TO STUDY HIM AND PERHAPS FIND OUT THE CAUSES OF HIS SUPREMACY
HER HEART SANK ONCE MORE
APPARENTLY SATISFIED AT LENGTH THAT THERE WAS NO TRAP LAID FOR THEM IN JOHN HATCH'S QUIESCENCE THE TWO LYNXES RAN FORWARD SWIFTLY AND SPRANG AT HIS NECK
THE SURVIVORS STILL TREMBLING REMEMBERED THAT THEY WERE HUNGRY AND FELL TO CROPPING THE GRITTY AND LITTERED GRASS
HIS SWOOP BECAME A DEMONSTRATION MERELY AN EXPRESSION OF HIS RAGE AT HAVING HIS PREY THUS SNATCHED FROM HIS BEAK
THEN GROWING IMPATIENT HE REARED HIMSELF ON HIS HAUNCHES IN ORDER TO SCRATCH WITH BOTH PAWS AT ONCE
BUT THE ENTRANCE TO IT WAS NARROW AND SHOAL JUST SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE SLOW INTERCHANGE OF WATERS WITH THE VIVIFYING OUTER CURRENT
HE RAISED HIS RIFLE STEADILY BRACING HIMSELF WITH KNEES AND FEET IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION
AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN-REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
SUCH A BEAR HE WAS ASSURED COULD HARBOR NO EVIL INTENTIONS
SMITTEN WITH THE WANDERLUST HE HAD STRUCK CLEAR ACROSS THE CONTINENT FROM THE SPRUCE WOODS AND RICH RIVER MEADOWS OF NEW BRUNSWICK TO THE GIGANTIC MOUNTAIN CHAOS OF THE ROCKIES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA
BUT THE POOL THEY COULD REACH ONLY BY A DELIBERATE FLAPPING APPROACH WHICH GAVE EVEN THE DROWSIEST BASKER AMPLE TIME TO SEEK REFUGE IN THE SAFE DEPTHS
NO DECIDEDLY HE MUST NOT SLEEP
IN THE NEXT INSTANT THE SNAKY NECK OF THE HERON UNCOILED ITSELF AND THE JAVELIN BILL DARTED UP AT HIM LIKE LIGHTNING
BUT THE REST UNEASY YET UNCOMPREHENDING OBEYED THE ANCESTRAL IMPULSE AND GATHERED TILL THE NORTHERN PLAINS WERE BLACK WITH THEM
BUT BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN TWO STRIDES LONG JACKSON WAS AT THE DOOR AND HAD SNATCHED UP A HEAVY STEEL-SHOD PEEVY HAVING NOT YET QUITE RECOVERED HE WAS STILL A BIT EXCITABLE FOR A WOODSMAN
A SUDDEN FLOCK OF SAND-PIPERS PUFFED DOWN ALONG THE SHORE ALIGHTED PIPING MELLOWLY ON THE MUD JUST BEYOND THE WRECK AND FLICKERED GRAY AND WHITE AS THEY BOBBED THEIR STIFF LITTLE TAILS UP AND DOWN IN THEIR FEEDING
INTERESTED AT ONCE HE STRODE FORWARD TO EXAMINE IT
ON A CERTAIN DAY HE WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF GREATLY IN THE FELLING OF A HUGE BIRCH
BUT BROWN BULL AFTER CROPPING THE SWEET TUFTED GRASS FOR A FEW MINUTES WAS SEIZED WITH ONE OF HIS PANGS OF APPREHENSION AND RAISED HIS HEAD FOR A FRESH SURVEY OF THE DISTANCE
THEN HIS EYES GLANCING AHEAD CAUGHT A GLEAM OF YELLOW LIGHT THROUGH THE TREE-TRUNKS
THE OTHERS SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT THE MONSTER NOW THAT ITS RIDER HAD DISMOUNTED WAS MERELY ANOTHER OF THE MAN-CREATURE'S TOOLS SUCH AS A BOAT OR A CANOE INANIMATE AND HARMLESS EXCEPT WHEN ITS DREADED MASTER CHOSE TO ANIMATE IT
THAT FAT YOUNG MOOSE CRITTER O YOURN'LL COME IN MIGHTY HANDY JEST NOW
THIS WAS A PERIL TO BE DEALT WITH DRASTICALLY
THEM REDSKINS UP NORTH HAVE BEEN ROBBING US THEY SHOUTED WITH FINE LOGIC
THITHER HE LED HIS HERD ALLOWING THEM NOT A MOMENT TO REST OR PASTURE SO LONG AS THE SHAMBLES OF THE PLAIN REMAINED IN VIEW
HE COVETED THE MAGNIFICENT HEAD OF THAT CALM WATCHER ON THE PEAK
I AX THEIR PARDON TAKING THE PARDON FOR GRANTED HE WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT
A MOMENT MORE AND THE LONG NECK STRAIGHTENED OUT AND THE NARROW HEAD HUNG LIMPLY OVER THE EDGE OF THE NEST
TO HIS IMPATIENCE IT SEEMED NO TIME AT ALL ERE THE RIVAL BUGLINGS CAME TOGETHER AND CEASED
BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR THEIR CRIES OF COURSE THROUGH THE ROAR OF THE GNOME
SHE LEAPT ASIDE AND THE BLOW OF THOSE ARMED PAWS INSTEAD OF BREAKING HER BACK MERELY RIPPED A LONG SCARLET FURROW DOWN HER FLANK
THE STRANGER THOUGH AT FIRST SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY WOOF'S VIOLENT EFFORTS TO WAG A NON-EXISTENT TAIL APPARENTLY FOUND HER BIG WOOER SYMPATHETIC
NOW OF ONE THING BLUE FOX WAS WELL AWARE IT HAVING BEEN BORNE IN UPON HIM BY EXPERIENCE--VIZ THAT A KILL NOT SOON EATEN WOULD SPEEDILY SPOIL IN THIS WEATHER
HIS HERD CHARGED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS NONE QUESTIONING HIS LEADERSHIP AND THE WHOLE HOST FOLLOWED HEADS DOWN BLIND WITH PANIC
THE DOOR OF THE CAMP WAS A HEAVY ONE AND STURDILY PUT TOGETHER BUT ALONG ITS BOTTOM WAS A CRACK SOME HALF AN INCH IN WIDTH
THIS STUFF SHE KNEW WOULD FLARE UP AT ONCE AND DIE IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES
AN IMMENSE WHITE WOLF HAD SPRUNG IN BETWEEN THE HORDES AND THEIR QUARRY AND STOOD THERE RIGID CONFRONTING HIS FELLOWS WITH BARED FANGS FLATTENED EARS AND EVERY HAIR ERECT ALONG HIS BACK
BUT BRANNIGAN WAS NO SHIRKER
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE HERDS YIELDED WAY HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY SEEKING MERELY THEIR OWN CONVENIENCE
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT SWUNG ON WITH A LONG LOPING BENT-KNEED STRAIGHT-FOOTED STRIDE HIS IMMENSE RACQUET-LIKE SNOWSHOES SETTLING INTO THE SNOW AT EACH STEP WITH A CURIOUS MUFFLED SIGH THAT HAD SMALL RESEMBLANCE TO ANY OTHER SOUND ON EARTH
THE WOLF HIS MASTER IN STRENGTH THOUGH NOT IN CRAFT WAS ALWAYS READY TO HUNT HIM WITH A BITTER COMBINATION OF HUNGER AND OF HATE
THE SHOW WAS WORTH THE PRICE THE EYES IN THE BUSH LOW OVER THE WIDE PALLID ALMOST UNRUFFLED EXPANSE OF TIDE A GREAT GHOST-GRAY BIRD CAME FLAPPING SHOREWARD HEAVILY
THERE WAS NO TIME TO CHANGE HIS DIRECTION AND IN HIS PANIC THE PERIL IN FRONT WAS NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH THE PERIL BEHIND
SHE SLIGHTLY BACKED AWAY SHRINKING AND SNORTING BUT AT LENGTH ALLOWED BRANNIGAN'S OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS TO APPROACH HER DEWY MUZZLE
AN I'M SURE SHE'D BE PROUD EF SHE COULD UNDERSTAND BUT JACKSON WAS INDIGNANT AS HE WENT LABORING ON LEANING UPON MARY'S POWERFUL SHOULDER
AS THE WIND BLEW ON THAT DAY THIS CORNER OF THE RUINS WAS A NOOK OF SHELTER
HE KNEW THAT HERE AWAY FROM HER STEEPS AND PINNACLES SHE WAS NO MATCH FOR HIM IN SPEED AND HE KNEW TOO THAT ONCE SHE SAW HERSELF DESERTED BY THE FLOCK HER POWERS WOULD FAIL HER IN SHEER PANIC
THEN HIS LONG BODY SHOT OUT AGAIN AND UPWARD TO ITS FULL HEIGHT AND CRASHED DOWN UPON HER NECK WITH A SICK TWIST THAT SNAPPED THE VERTEBRAE LIKE CHALK
A MOMENT LATER IT WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM AS HE SAW THE TAWNY HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF AN IMMENSE PANTHER EMERGE FOR JUST THE FRACTION OF A SECOND INTO THE TRAIL
AT THE CURIOUS BLUNT BEAK OF THE MONSTER HE DISCERNED A SORT OF CIRCLE OF FAINT HAZE A BLUISH BLUR BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING WHICH DID NOT SEEM TO CONCERN HIM AND HE MADE NO EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND IT
WHAT IF ONE OF THE MISGUIDED BIRDS SHOULD FOUL HIS PROPELLER OR COME BLUNDERING ABOARD AND SNAP A STAY OR A CONTROL WIRE
THE FOLLOWING PAGES CONTAIN ADVERTISEMENTS OF MACMILLAN BOOKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR BY CHARLES G
THEY MADE THEIR PREPARATIONS WITH METICULOUS CARE TAKING NO RISK
BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO RAIN LATELY AND THE GROUND WAS HARD AND THE DEAD-BROWN SPRUCE NEEDLES FORMED A CARPET WHICH TOOK LITTLE IMPRESSION FROM WARY PAWS AND HE GAINED NO CLUE WHATEVER
HE DID NOT SWERVE BUT SWEPT DOWN STRAIGHT UPON THE ASTONISHED KNOT OF HORSEMEN
BUT THE OLD INSTINCTS WERE STILL STRONG IN HIM
THEN DROPPING INTO A RAVINE TILL THEIR COURSE WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM ALL HOSTILE EYES IN THE TIMBER HE LED THE WAY AROUND THE MOUNTAINSIDE FOR SEVERAL MILES
AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SKIRTS OF THE COLONY THE MOSS WAS FULL OF SCURRYING AND SQUEAKING NOISES
FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SHE HAD MANAGED TO KEEP ALIVE ON SUCH DEAD GRASS AS SHE COULD PAW DOWN TO THROUGH THE SNOW AND ON SUCH TWIGS OF BIRCH AND POPLAR AS SHE COULD MANAGE TO CHEW
THEN AFTER A WASH IN THE LAKE HE TURNED BACK TO FETCH HIS PARTNER AND THE DRAG THAT THEY MIGHT HAUL THE DEAD MOOSE TO THE CAMP AND CUT IT UP CONVENIENTLY AT HOME
THEN I'LL GO AN FIX HER SOME CORN-MEAL GRUEL SEEIN'S WE HAVEN'T GOT NO PROPER MILK FOR HER AND HE PROCEEDED TO UNHITCH THE ROPE FROM THE DRAG
THE FISH HE DID NOT SEE
AGAIN MCLAGGAN REGRETTED HIS RIFLE FOR THE VIRILE FULNESS OF THAT BUGLING SUGGESTED AN UNUSUALLY FINE BULL AND A SPLENDID PAIR OF ANTLERS
THAT GAUNT GRAY SUMMIT WAS REGARDED AS PRACTICALLY UNSCALABLE
AND FOR THE TIME WOOF FORGOT THE FARM HIS MASTER JINNY AND EVEN MRS JABE'S IMPETUOUS BROOM
HIS LEGS WERE HELD DOWN IT SEEMED BY BATTLING MOUNTAINS
HIS BEAK WITH ITS KEEN-TOOTHED EDGES WAS A FORMIDABLE WEAPON BY MEANS OF WHICH HE COULD DOUBTLESS HAVE CAPTURED DISABLED AND DRAGGED TO SHORE EVEN A FISH OF A POUND OR SO IN WEIGHT
HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THERE WAS ON TOP OF OLD BALD FACE
IT WAS A GREAT QUARREL WHICH NEITHER WOULD SHIRK
THE CAN CLATTERED AGAIN STILL IN THE SAME PLACE
BY HANGING UPON THE SKIRTS OF IT HE HELD HIMSELF READY TO DETACH HIS LITTLE HERD FROM ITS COMPANY AND MAKE OFF AMONG THE FOOTHILLS IN CASE OF NEED
NOW IT WAS FATAL TO HIMSELF
SHE WOULD SAVE THE REMAINING MATCHES
OF THE OTHER TWO ONE MADE GOOD HIS ESCAPE BECAUSE HIS PONY HAD TAKEN ALARM MORE QUICKLY THAN ITS MASTER AND TURNED IN TIME
HE KNEW THE WHIPCORD MUSCLE UNDERLYING THAT SOFT RED FUR THE DEADLY GRIP OF THOSE LONG NARROW JAWS
IT WAS NOT YET SUNSET AND HE FELT REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE PACK WOULD NOT DARE TO CLOSE IN UPON THEIR PREY BEFORE DUSK BEGAN TO FALL SO HE CONTINUED TO DRAG HIS LOADED TOBOGGAN ALONG KNOWING THAT IF HE SHOULD LEAVE IT BEHIND HIM ITS PRECIOUS CARGO WOULD FALL A PREY TO THE LYNXES AND THE FOXES
AT FIRST THE OTTER CAME ON WITH A STEADY RUSH AS IF DISDAINING ALL FENCE AND ALL PRECAUTION
IN EVERY LINE AND HUE HE WAS UNMISTAKABLY AN ARISTOCRAT AMONG DUCKS AND AN ARROGANT ONE AT THAT
THE TEAL'S WINGS THROBBING WITH A SWIFT SHORT VIBRATION WHISTLED SHRILLY IN THE STILL AIR SO THAT A PROWLING WILDCAT BY THE WATERSIDE HEARD THE SOUND EVEN ABOVE THE DULL ROAR OF THE RAPIDS AND GLARED UPWARD ALERTLY
AS MOTIONLESS AND INDIFFERENT AS THE SUCKERS THEMSELVES THEY HUNG ON SOFTLY FANNING FINS AND TOOK NO NOTICE WHEN EVEN THE MOST TEMPTING MORSELS TRAVERSED THE GLASSY SURFACE
BUT HE WAS WRONG FOR AGAIN THE WHIMSICAL FATES INTERFERED PERCEIVING A CHANCE FOR SUCH A TRICK AS THEY HAD PROBABLY NEVER PLAYED BEFORE
THE TWO FISHERMEN WHO HAD DRIVEN OUT FROM TOWN IN THE GRAY OF DAWN OVER THOSE FIFTEEN MILES OF BAD BACKWOODS ROAD HAD FISHED THE STREAM UPWARD FROM THE BRIDGE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING
THE PANDEMONIUM OF SNARLS AND SCREECHES THAT FILLED HIS EARS BEWILDERED HIM
THE CALF THUS POINTEDLY ADDRESSED BACKED FURTHER INTO THE BUSH AND STARED IN MOURNFUL BEWILDERMENT
AN I SAY THE POOR LITTLE CRITTER D OUGHTER HAVE HER CHANCE
BUT NOT SO THE VICTOR
IN THE SPURT OF LIGHT THE PLACE LOOKED WARM AND SNUG
AS IF IN DOUBT HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS HIND LEGS WITH HIS FORE-PAWS ON THE TIRE OF THE NEAREST WHEEL AND TOOK A LONG SATISFYING SNIFF
TOWARD NOON THE FISHERMEN HAD RETURNED TO THE CLEARING TO LUNCH BENEATH THE BIRCH TREE AND TO FEED AND WATER THE HORSE
HE SNARLED SHRILLY THROUGH THE LITTLE SQUARE HOLE IN THE COVER WHILE HIS ASSAILANT BALKED OF HER PREY AND FURIOUS WITH THE SMART OF HER WOUND POUNCED ONCE MORE UPON THE BASKET AND STROVE TO CLAW AN ENTRANCE
THE PANTHER WAS CREEPING OUT UPON A GREAT BRANCH ALMOST OVER THE SNEEZING BULL'S HEAD
CHILD OF THE BACKWOODS THOUGH SHE WAS SHE HAD NEVER SLEPT OUT ALONE WITH THE GREAT TREES AND THE MYSTERIOUS NIGHT STILLNESS
THERE SEEMED BUT ONE THING FOR THEM TO DO--TO FOLLOW THE SOUTHWARD MIGRATION OF THE GAME
THEY WERE CONFIDENT FEARLESS FOOTSTEPS TAKING NO CARE WHATEVER TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES SO SHE KNEW AT ONCE THAT THEY WERE THE STEPS OF THE ONLY CREATURE THAT PRESUMED TO GO SO NOISILY THROUGH THE GREAT SILENCES
THE SONOROUS CHALLENGES ANSWERED EACH OTHER ABRUPTLY AND APPROACHED EACH OTHER SWIFTLY
HIS TRAINED EYES SOON TOLD HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THEN WITH HIS STUB TAIL STIFF IN THE AIR AND STEPPING HAUGHTILY HE MARCHED OFF INTO THE SILENT GREEN SHADES TO MAKE HIS MEAL
HE DECIDED THAT HE MUST GET FAR ABOVE THIS AREA OF DISTURBANCE AND THEN SPIRAL DOWN DIRECTLY OVER THE PLATEAU WHERE AS HE CALCULATED THE CURRENTS WOULD BE LESS TUMULTUOUS
WELL ALONG IN THE AFTERNOON HE STARTED HOMEWARD WITH A LIGHT HEART AS MANY TRIMMED POLES ON HIS DRAG AS THE SORREL COULD COMFORTABLY HAUL
THE HORSE IT PAID NO HEED TO
IT WAS A LIGHT HICKORY-HANDLED GENERAL-UTILITY AXE SUCH AS ANY EXPERT BACKWOODSMAN KNOWS HOW TO USE WITH SWIFT AND DEADLY EFFECT WHETHER AS A HAND-TO-HAND WEAPON OR AS A MISSILE
BUT ALREADY HER ADVERSARY HAD HIS CLUTCH UPON HER THROAT
THEN HE CAME ON AT FIRST DAINTILY AND MINCINGLY AND ONLY AFTER THAT FORMAL PRELIMINARY DID HE BREAK INTO HIS FURIOUS RUSH
OF THE OTHER DWELLERS IN THE POOL NOT ONE KNEW HOW HE HAD VANISHED
THERE REMAINED OF IT NOTHING AT ALL BUT A DIM SATISFACTION THAT FOUR DANGEROUS ENEMIES TO HIS SHEEP HAD BEEN THUS EASILY DISPOSED OF
PAST THE FOOT OF THE CLEARING WITH DANCING SPARKLE AND A CRISP MUSICAL CLAMOR RAN A SHALLOW STREAM SOME DOZEN YARDS IN WIDTH ITS CLEAR WATERS AMBER-TAWNY FROM THE FAR-OFF CEDAR-SWAMPS IN WHICH IT TOOK ITS RISE
NOISELESSLY SHE GATHERED THOSE FEW HANDFULS OF WITHERED SPRUCE TWIGS AND HEAPED THEM UPON THE TOP OF THE STOVE
THE ENORMOUS CORRUGATED SPIRALS OF HIS HORNS LAY BACK OVER HIS NECK AND SHOULDERS AS HE STOOD AND HIS ARROGANT EYES OF BLACK AND GOLD APPEARED HALF-SHUT AS THEY SEARCHED THE JUMBLE OF PEAKS RAVINES AND LAKE-DOTTED VALLEYS OUTSPREAD IN STILL CONFUSION BENEATH HIM
HE COULD NOT IMAGINE A FIERY-TEMPERED PERSONAGE LIKE THE MINK TAMELY SUBMITTING TO THE RAPE OF HIS BANQUET
MOOSE PULLIN UP WATER-LILY ROOTS HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WITH SATISFACTION
THE HORSE FEELING RATHER LONELY NEIGHED AFTER HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED
JUST AS THE BEAR CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND STARTED AT HIM OPEN-MOUTHED HE FIRED AND THE ANIMAL SPRAWLED FORWARD A HUGE FURRY HEAP WITH A BALL THROUGH THE BASE OF HIS BRAIN
HIS EARS GAVE HIM ALL THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRED AND HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO RISK THE LOSS OF THE SLENDEREST FRACTION OF A SECOND
THEN HE UNDERSTOOD
WHAT D'YE WANT O ME ANYHOW THE HUGE BLACK BEAST WAGGED HIS HINDQUARTERS FRANTICALLY AND WALLOWED ON THE FLOOR IN HIS FAWNING DELIGHT AT THE SOUND OF A HUMAN VOICE
AND THE TROUT WAS HURLED FAR UP THE BANK
THERE WAS NEITHER ROOM NOR SUPPLY FOR THEM NOW IN THE HOME BURROWS AND THEY HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT THE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND FORETHOUGHT THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO DIG BURROWS FOR THEMSELVES
HE CATCHING SIGHT OF THE DREADFUL ONSLAUGHT OVER HIS SHOULDER DROPPED THE TREE HE WAS DRAGGING AND SPRANG DESPERATELY FOR THE DOUBTFUL SHELTER OF HIS FIRE
HIS SWOOP WAS AS SOFT SOUNDLESS AND EFFORTLESS AS IF HE HAD BEEN BUT A WISP OF FEATHERS BLOWN ON A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND
AND HAVING HEARD THAT THE WILD MOUNTAIN RAM OF THE ROCKIES WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT QUARRY TO BRING DOWN HE ITCHED TO TRY HIS OLD EASTERN WOODCRAFT IN THIS NEW CHASE AND WIN THE PRIZE UNAIDED
AND WHEN A BACKWOODSMAN GETS AT ODDS WITH HIS BACON THEN SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE DONE
BUT SOMEWHERE IN HER STURDY DOGGISH MAKE-UP THERE WAS A TOUCH OF TEMPERAMENT OF SOMETHING ALMOST APPROACHING IMAGINATION TO WHICH THIS STRANGE FOSTER-CHILD OF HERS APPEALED AS NO ORDINARY PUPPY COULD EVER HAVE DONE
ACCUSTOMED AS THEY WERE TO MOVING EVERYWHERE ON SNOWSHOES IN THE WINTER THE TWO WOODSMEN FOUND IT INFINITELY LABORIOUS AND EXHAUSTING TO FLOUNDER THEIR WAY THROUGH A FOUR-FOOT DEPTH OF LIGHT SNOW
YES SHE CRIED HASTILY HIDING THE LITTLE ONE IN A FOLD OF HER BLANKET AND GLANCING OVER HER SHOULDER HIS NAME IS WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT IT WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE--AS THE FATHER AFTERWARD AGREED--TO GAINSAY THE CHILD'S MOTHER AT THAT MOMENT OF SUPREME AUTHORITY BUT THE OLD WOMAN HAD HER MISGIVINGS
AT THE SAME TIME SHE FOUND HERSELF GLANCING NERVOUSLY OVER HER SHOULDER AS THE SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND DEEPENED AND ALL THE WILDERNESS TURNED TO DUSKY VIOLET
AS SHE WAS SHAKING THE CRUMBS FROM HER LAP SHE HEARD VOICES AND POUNDING SPLASHING HOOFS FROM UP THE TRAIL
THE HORDE OF THE GIANT MIGRANTS WAS NOT A HOMOGENEOUS MASS AS IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO ONE VIEWING IT FROM A DISTANCE AND A HEIGHT
HE HAD BETHOUGHT HIM THAT THE PANTHER'S FAVORITE METHOD OF ATTACK WAS TO DROP UPON HIS QUARRY'S NECK FROM ABOVE
HALF A MINUTE LATER THE LYNX STROLLED AWAY VERY DELIBERATELY
PETE ALLEN WAS PROSPECTING
CLOSE AHEAD OF HIM NOW THE TEAL SAW REFUGE--THE FLASHING LINE OF THE RAPIDS
THIS MATTER OF A TAIL WAS ONE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH WOOF HAD TO ENCOUNTER IN PLAYING THE PART OF A DOG
EVEN AS THE GRIZZLY WAS IN THE ACT OF FALLING FORWARD ALLEN RAISED HIS RIFLE AGAIN
HE WAS NOT USED TO BEING OPPOSED BUT HE COULD NOT INSTANTLY FORGET THAT THESE VISITORS WERE HIS GUESTS
BUT IT WAS NOT A SUCCESS
AND HERE ONE OF HIS CHOPPERS CAME TACTFULLY TO HIS AID
THE MASSIVE PAWS SEEMED TO FUMBLE INQUISITIVELY
HERE IN THE GOLD-GREEN WINDY OPEN BELLY-DEEP IN THE LOW BLUE-JEWELED BUSHES WOOF FEASTED GREEDILY
ONLY THE WHITE SENTINEL REMAINED AND HE HAD SHRUNK BACK TO HIS FORMER STATURE WHICH WAS BEYOND THAT OF HIS FELLOWS INDEED BUT NOT ALTOGETHER INCREDIBLE
HE WANTED TO SHOOT THE SKUNKS AS VARMIN INIMICAL TO HIS CHICKENS
AFTER THE DEEP TRENCH WAS DUG THEY MADE A SOUND FOUNDATION FOR THEIR FIRE AT ONE END OF IT
GOT MORE WHIMS N A MARE COLT THAT JEFF A MOMENT LATER THE COW SNORTED AND GAVE A JUMP WHICH WOULD HAVE UPSET A LESS WARY MILKER THAN JOHN HATCH
YET HE COULD HAVE SWORN HE HAD HEARD NOTHING SEEN NOTHING SMELT NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE CONVICTION
BETWEEN THE EDGED SUMMIT AND THE LEDGE WHERE HIS FLOCK PASTURED WAS AN ALL BUT PERPENDICULAR DROP OF SMOOTH-FACED ROCK
HE SNATCHED UP THE FISH IN HIS TEETH AND GROWLED AGAIN
PEARS TO THINK HE'S SOME KIND OF A DAWG EXPLAINED THE COOK SO I LET HIM COME ALONG IN FOR COMPANY
FEAR SEEMS TO TRAVEL BY SOME UNCOMPREHENDED BUT VERY EFFICIENT WIRELESS AND FEAR IN THE LORDS OF THE AIR WAS A THING TOO UNUSUAL TO BE IGNORED
THAT IS NOT THE WIND
MCLAGGAN WAS GRATIFIED AT THIS CONFIRMATION OF HIS WOODCRAFT BUT HE WAS NOW A LITTLE ANXIOUS AS TO WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT
THE THIRD WAS OVERTAKEN BECAUSE A COW WHICH HE HAD WOUNDED STUMBLED IN HIS WAY AND HE AND HIS PONY WENT OUT ALONG WITH HER BENEATH THE HOOFS OF BROWN BULL'S HERD
STARTLED AT THIS ATTACK HE JUMPED AROUND SHARPLY AND WAS JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF POUNDING THE IMPERTINENT THING VICIOUSLY UNDER FOOT WHEN TO HIS ANNOYANCE HE BEGAN TO SNEEZE
IN THIS MOMENT HIS HEART WAS NO MORE SHAKEN AND THE TRADITION OF HIS ANCESTORS WHICH BADE HIM FOLLOW HIS LEADERS LIKE A SHEEP WAS TORN UP BY THE ROOTS
FOR ONE INSTANT THE OTTER'S DARK AND FURIOUS EYES BLAZED INTO THE PALE EYES OF THE LYNX AT A DISTANCE OF NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN OR EIGHTEEN INCHES
BUT BY THIS TIME THEY WERE TOO WEAK FOR ANY EFFECTUAL EFFORT AT ESCAPE AND IN THEIR BLINDNESS THEY COULD NOT FIND THE SHORE
THE BULL JUMPED YET AGAIN AND SHOOK HIS HEAD MORE VIOLENTLY
ONE HOT MORNING AS THE GREAT CAT LAY ON THE ROOT STARING DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS WITH HIS FIERCE MOON EYES HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO OBSERVE THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY EVEN THE TROUT WERE TOO INDOLENT TO STIR
THEY USED THE LAST MATCH AND THEY BUILT A FIRE SO GENEROUS THAT FOR A WHILE THEY COULD HARDLY ENDURE ITS COMPANY IN THE TRENCH
BETWEEN HIS EYES AND THE PALLID HORIZON HE DETECTED A WIDE-WINGED BIRD SWINGING LOW OVER THE MARSHES
BUT AT FIRST HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM BEING INTENT UPON THE SEARCH FOR A GOOD LANDING-PLACE AND UPON THE MYSTERY OF THAT SKY-INHABITING POOL
HE FELT SURE THAT IN THE NEXT SECOND OR TWO A SNAKY BLACK SHAPE ALL TEETH AND SPRINGS AND VENOM WOULD DART FROM THE BASKET AND BE AT HIS THROAT
AS LONG AS HATCH KEPT OUT OF THE WOODS OR THE VERY IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THEM HE WAS QUITE UNTROUBLED BY THE SENSE OF THE HAUNTING SHADOW AND THE UNSEEN WATCHING EYES
HE LENGTHENED HIMSELF OUT BELLY TO EARTH AND SPED FOR THE BURROWS
BUT WILD ANIMALS ARE USUALLY QUICK TO REALIZE IT WHEN AN ENEMY OR A QUARRY HAS BEEN DISABLED
THE WILD CLATTER OF THE STOVE-PIPES HAD FURTHER DISTURBED HIM AND HE HAD WITHDRAWN TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION
HE WAS ENTIRELY FEARLESS WHETHER IT WERE IN A FIGHT OR A LOG-JAM
OR HOW LONG WOULD THOSE RAVENING WATCHERS REMAIN OBEDIENT TO THE AUTHORITY THAT DENIED THEIR HUNGER RELIEF
WHEN THEY WOKE THEY WERE HALF FROZEN AND SAVAGE WITH HUNGER
FOR THE EAGLES HE HAD SMALL CONCERN EXCEPT JUST AT LAMBING-TIME AND EVEN THEN EACH EWE MOTHER WITH HER SHORT SPIKY HORNS AND NIMBLE RAZOR-EDGED HOOFS WAS QUICK AND ABLE TO PROTECT HER OWN LITTLE ONE
YE AIN'T GOIN TO BE NO HERO AFTER ALL WHAT'RE YE GRUNTIN ABOUT TOM DEMANDED JACKSON DULLY AROUSED BY THE RING IN HIS PARTNER'S VOICE
HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NOTHING OF INTEREST LEFT IN THAT PATCH OF TIMBER--THOUGH ALL THE WHILE THE PUMA WAS EYEING HIM WITH CURIOUS INTEREST FROM A GREAT BRANCH NOT FAR OVERHEAD--HE TOOK UP THE TRAIL OF THE FLOCK'S FLIGHT AND STARTED ONCE MORE UP THE MOUNTAIN
TO A COOL OBSERVER OF EVEN THE MOST LIMITED INTELLIGENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT THESE CONTORTIONS WERE INTENDED TO BE CONCILIATORY
BUT IN THAT SAVAGE COLD THEIR TOIL ATE UP THEIR VITALITY WITH AMAZING SPEED
BUT THIS WAS A STRANGER SO HE SUPPRESSED HIS IMPULSE TO RUSH IN AND WALLOW DELIGHTEDLY BEFORE THE BUNK
FOR HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THE COARSENESS AND RANKNESS OF BEAR-MEAT EXCEPT WHEN TAKEN YOUNG
FOR NEARLY HALF A MILE THE TRAIL STRETCHED AWAY BEHIND HIM BETWEEN THE GIANT TRUNKS AND FRINGING BUSH-GROWTH--NARROW PERFECTLY STRAIGHT COMPLETELY SHADOWED FROM SUN AND SKY BUT VISIBLE ALL THE WAY IN THAT CURIOUSLY TRANSPARENT GLASSY GLOOM OF THE UNDER-FOREST WORLD
THE IDEA OF BEING DASHED TO PIECES IN THAT SKYEY SOLITUDE WAS SOMEHOW MORE DAUNTING TO HIS SPIRIT THAN THE PROSPECT WHICH HE FACED INDIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY--THAT OF BEING HURLED DOWN UPON FAMILIAR EARTH
PLUCKY BEGGARS HE SAID TO HIMSELF ADMIRINGLY TO THINK OF SHOWING FIGHT TO A GROWN-UP AEROPLANE THE NEXT MOMENT AS HE NOTED THE SPREAD OF THOSE FLAPPING WINGS THE SHINING SNOWY OUTSTRETCHED HEADS AND NECKS THE FIRM AND FORMIDABLE HALF-OPENED BEAKS A SWEAT OF APPREHENSION BROKE OUT ALL OVER HIM
HE FELT NO MORE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE DOGGING SHADOWS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY HAD WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES AT THE SOUND OF THE GUNSHOT
BRANNIGAN FLUSHED
ON THE SECOND DAY BEING VERY HUNGRY HE GAVE UP ALL HOPE OF BACON SCRAPS AND SET OFF TO THE WOODS TO FORAGE ONCE MORE FOR HIMSELF
MCLAGGAN EXPECTED HIM TO TURN AND FLEE BACK TO HIS COWS AND HASTEN TO SHEPHERD THEM AWAY FROM DANGER
HATCH FRAMED HIS LIPS TO WHISTLE IN HIS SATISFACTION AT THE PICTURE
THE SKIN OF HIS CHEEKS BENEATH THE GRIZZLED STUBBLE CREPT CURIOUSLY
CHILDREN OF THE WILD WITH ILLUSTRATIONS CLOTH 12MO $1.35 AS MIGHT BE INFERRED FROM THE TITLE OF CHARLES G
MACCREEDY WATCHED THEM GO AND DROPPED HIS WEAPON BACK INTO THE KIT
THE WAITING WOLVES VANISHED
HIS RIDICULOUS STUMP OF A TAIL WHICH WAS QUITE HIDDEN FROM THE SIGHT OF THE POOL-DWELLERS BEGAN TO TWITCH ANGRILY
IT CAME STRAIGHT ON TOWARD THE COLONY OF THE FOXES FLYING LOWER AND LOWER TILL BLUE FOX BEGAN TO GATHER HIS STEEL-LIKE MUSCLES TO BE READY FOR A SPRING AT ITS THROAT IF IT SHOULD COME WITHIN REACH
THEN A MIXTURE OF PRUDENCE AND CURIOSITY HELD HIM BACK OR RATHER DELAYED HIS PURPOSE
THE SOUND GREW LOUDER LOUDER MORE PENETRATING AND INSISTENT AND THEN HE CAME OUT OF HIS VISION WITH A START
BUT I'M GOING TO KINDER REQUISITION THE CRITTER AS HE SPOKE HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AS IF TO GO AND CARRY OUT HIS PURPOSE ON THE INSTANT
THEN HE LED THE WAY DOWN THE NAKED STEEP NOW FLOODED WITH THE LEVEL RADIANCE OF THE THREE-FOURTHS RISEN SUN TOWARD THE FRESH SPRING PASTURAGE ALONG THE UPPER LIMITS OF THE TIMBER-BELT
BUT THERE AIN'T A GAME-WARDEN WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES O THIS CAMP AN I'D RISK IT IF THERE WAS
HIS ROUND YELLOW EYES OPENED AND SHUT SEVERAL TIMES AND HIS BEAK SNAPPED LIKE A PAIR OF CASTANETS
IN A MINUTE OR TWO HIS APPETITE RETURNED AND HE COULD RESUME HIS MEAL
FINDING NO TAIL TO WAG HE DID THE BEST HE COULD WITH HIS WHOLE MASSIVE HINDQUARTERS TO THE DISCOMFITURE OF ALL THAT GOT IN THE WAY
THEY WERE FILLED WITH AWE OF THIS GIGANTIC BEING WHICH FLEW WITH RIGID WINGS AND SUCH APPALLING ROAR YET ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE RIDDEN BY THE MAN BETWEEN ITS SHOULDERS
JUST THEN AN OWL ASTONISHED FLEW HURRIEDLY THROUGH THE BRANCHES FAR OVERHEAD
THERE WAS HIS TROPHY THE SPLENDID HORNS WHICH HE HAD STRIVEN SO HARD TO WIN WITHIN HIS GRASP AT LAST
THERE WAS A BLUE-WHITE SPURT AND THE REPORT CLASHED DEAFENINGLY WITHIN THE NARROW QUARTERS
THEN HE CAME AND GLARED UP AT MCLAGGAN AS MUCH AS TO SAY
ACTING ON THE FIRST IMPULSE OF HIS COURAGEOUS SPIRIT WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT STARTED INSTANTLY IN PURSUIT HUNTING THE HUNTERS
THEN HE DRAGGED IT BACK TOWARD THE ROCK
JUST ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE CLEAR BLUE OVERHEAD A GREEN-WINGED TEAL WAS BEATING HIS WAY ABOVE THE TREETOPS MAKING FOR THE STREAM WITH THE FEAR OF DEATH AT HIS HEART
HE COVERED ACCURATELY THE FORM OF THE BROWN RAM LEAPING UP THE SLOPE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
BUT BRANNIGAN'S SYMPATHIES WARM IF ILLOGICAL HAD BEGUN TO ASSERT THEMSELVES WITH EMPHASIS
JUST NOW IN THE LATE AND SODDEN NORTHERN SPRING IT WAS A DISHEARTENING STRETCH OF HUMMOCKS AND BOG-HOLES THE BOG-HOLES EMPHASIZED BY A LEG-BREAKING ARRAY OF HALF ROTTEN POLES LAID CROSSWAYS
NOW THE TRAMP COURTEOUS IN HIS DEPREDATIONS HAD TAKEN THOUGHT TO REFASTEN THE BASKET
SHE DID NOT NOTICE APPARENTLY THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER TWO OR PERHAPS HER SENSE OF NUMBERS WAS DEFECTIVE AND SHE COULD NOT COUNT
THE PALLID MIDWINTER DAWN WAS SPREADING UP A SKY OF ICY OPAL WHEN HE STOPPED AND MUTTERED ABRUPTLY IF WE CAN'T EAT WE MUST REST A SPELL BRANNIGAN WAS FOR PUSHING ON BUT A GLANCE AT JACKSON'S FACE PERSUADED HIM
THEN HE ROUNDED A CORNER AND THERE FIFTY PACES AHEAD OF HIM WAS WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR
THEN HIS TERROR FADED APPETITE ONCE MORE BEGAN TO INVITE HIS ATTENTION AND HE TOOK NOTE OF A MINNOW FLICKERING SLOWLY OVER THE SUN-FLECKED MUD BELOW HIM
YET--HE WAS GLAD OF THE OPEN
AT THIS SHE SHOOK HERSELF INDIGNANTLY SQUARED HER SHOULDERS STAMPED HER FOOT AND PLUNGED AHEAD WITH A FIRM RESOLUTION THAT THE APPROACH OF DARK SHOULD NOT MAKE HER A FOOL
HIS HUNGER WAS BLUNTED
HE SCRAMBLED OUT ON TO THE ROOT AND GLIDED NOISELESSLY UP THE BANK
WHEN HE GOT THERE HE FOUND BUT A CHIMNEY STANDING NAKED AND BLACKENED OVER A TANGLE OF CHARRED RUINS
BUSY AT HIS FEASTING HE FAILED TO NOTICE AT FIRST THE FLAPPING OF HEAVY WINGS
BUT HE THOUGHT HE WOULD MAKE SHIFT TO DO WITH THE VERY INFERIOR POLES WHICH GREW ALONG THE EDGE OF THE WILD MEADOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FARM
IN THAT FRACTION OF A SECOND WHEN HE SEEMED TO PAUSE FOR THE TURN DOWN SWEPT THE FURRY PAW
THROUGH ALL THE LASHED TURMOIL THE LYNX NEVER STIRRED SAVE TO FOLLOW WITH HIS HARD BRIGHT STARE THE LIGHTNING EVOLUTIONS OF THE FLIGHT AND THE PURSUIT
IN KEEN EXULTATION HE RAN FORWARD EXPECTING TO FIND HIS ENEMY STRETCHED ON THE SPRUCE NEEDLES
BUT FATE THE HAG GROWING JEALOUS NO DOUBT OF MARY'S POPULARITY NOW TURNED WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SNARL OF WARNING AND CLAWED THE HAPPY LITTLE HOUSEHOLD TO THE BONE
ONCE CLEAR OF THE OUTERMOST STUMP PASTURES AND BURNT LANDS WOOF PUSHED ON FEVERISHLY
HE HAD COME TO EXPLORE THE SUMMIT OF BALD FACE AND HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE BALKED BY A FLOCK OF BIRDS
THE TRAILS BEING FRESH IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE HUNT COULD NOT BE FAR AHEAD
HE BEGAN JERKING THE BASKET AND PULLING IT ABOUT SAVAGELY
THE REMAINING FOUR BIRDS HUNG IMMEDIATELY OVER THE SWIFTLY DROPPING PLANE BUT HESITATED TO ATTACK AFTER THE ROUGH EXPERIENCE OF THEIR FELLOWS
HERE WHERE THE NORTH FORK STREAM FELL INTO THE OTTANOONSIS WAS A RESORT EXACTLY TO HIS LIKING
HE SAW THE FRANTIC FUGITIVE DIVE OVER THE LEDGE AND DISAPPEAR
SHE HEARD HIS BREATHING CLOSE TO THE DOOR
HE TROTTED AWAY NONCHALANTLY TOWARD HIS BURROW UNDER THE ROOTS OF AN OLD BIRCH TREE ON THE HILL
BUT HIS TRAILING WING JERKED HIM SIDEWAYS SO THAT HE UTTERLY MISSED HIS AIM AND SPRAWLED AT THE HERON'S FEET
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN MINUTES SHE SHOULD BECOME A LIFELESS HIDEOUS SHAPELESS THING BENEATH THOSE MANGLING CLAWS
IF THE GAUNT GRAY TIMBER WOLF SHOULD COME DARTING BELLY TO EARTH FROM THE WOODS FOR ALL HIS SWIFTNESS THE FLOCK WOULD BE BOUNDING LIGHTLY FAR UP THE STEEP AS IF LIFTED ON A SUDDEN WIND BEFORE HE COULD COME ANYWHERE WITHIN REACH OF THEM
DID YOU SHOOT ANYTHING OH THAT WAS JEST A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDIN BEFORE HIM AN ME GOT ACQUAINTED EXPLAINED THE COOK WITH A TRACE OF EMBARRASSMENT
THIS HE DID NOT REGARD AS STEALING BUT MERELY AS THE EXACTION OF A SMALL AND REASONABLE TRIBUTE FROM A SOCIETY WHICH HAD OF LATE NEGLECTED TO FEED HIM ANY TOO WELL
AT THE SCATTERING OF HIS PRECIOUS SUPPLIES HIS SYMPATHIES HAD GONE OVER COMPLETELY TO THE PANTHER
BUT THESE WERE THE FIRST KITTENS OF THE HATED BREED THAT HATCH HAD EVER SEEN
A MAN BROUGHT UP IN THE BACKWOODS LEARNS TO THINK QUICKLY OR RATHER TO THINK AND ACT IN THE SAME INSTANT
ON A HIGH LEDGE SECURE FROM ANY UNSEEN APPROACH THE FLOCK RESTED FOR AN HOUR OR TWO CHEWING THE CUD IN PEACE IN THE VAST SILENCE OF THE BARE AND SUN-BATHED PEAKS
BOTH HE AND HIS PARTNER LONG JACKSON WERE SICK TO DEATH OF TROUT STEWED APPLES AND TEA
IF WE JEST WIPE THESE ERE BUFFALO CLEAN OUT RIGHT NOW THE REDSKINS'LL STARVE AN THIS COUNTRY'LL BE WELL QUIT O THEM BUT STRIVE AS THEY MIGHT TO CARRY OUT THIS HUMANE INTENTION FOR ALL THEIR SLAUGHTER ON THE FLANKS THE SOLID NUCLEUS OF THE HOST REMAINED UNSHAKEN AND KEPT DRIFTING STEADILY SOUTHWARD
NOW THERE WERE PLENTY MORE TROUT IN THE POOL TO BE CAUGHT AND THREE DEAD OR DYING FISH FLOATING THERE TO BE PICKED UP
STILL NO REPLY FROM THE OTTER
HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE DEEP COVERING ON THE GRAY VISITOR'S THROAT AND BREAST--FIRM CLOSE-LYING FEATHERS AND A LAVISH PADDING OF DOWN--WAS AN ARMOR TOO THICK AND RESISTANT FOR EVEN HIS KEEN TEETH
HE WAS EJECTED MERCILESSLY
ONLY WITH ASSIDUOUS PROPULSION COULD THEY INDUCE HER TO LEAD
BUT THE EAR OF THE OWL IS A MIRACLE OF SENSITIVENESS
HER HEART POUNDED WITH ANXIOUS SUSPICION
THEN WITHOUT KNOWING WHY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING LACKING IN JABE SMITH'S FARMYARD--EVEN IN JABE SMITH HIMSELF AND IN JINNY HIS FOSTER-MOTHER
FROM ALL THAT ALLEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO GATHER AS TO THE HABITS OF MOUNTAIN SHEEP HE CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS ABOUT THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE HE WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND THEM
IT WAS DEEP INDEED BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT BOTTOMLESS FOR HE COULD DISCERN ITS BOTTOM FROM ONE SHORE OR THE OTHER IN EVERY PART
THE RIVER HAD RISEN SUDDENLY OWING TO A CLOUDBURST FURTHER UP ITS COURSE AND MANY OF THE WEAKLINGS AND YOUNGSTERS OF THE HOST WERE SWEPT AWAY IN THE PASSAGE
WHEN HE FAILED IN EITHER VENTURE--WHICH WAS OFTEN ENOUGH THE CASE--HE FELT HIMSELF IN NO WAY CAST DOWN
IMMEDIATELY THE SKY CLEARED
WHAT HE REALIZED WAS THAT THE APPREHENDED DOOM HAD FALLEN UPON THE HOST AND THE HOST WAS NO MORE
SHE RAN AWAY DOWN THE FIELD TOSSING HER HORNS TO JOIN HER COMPANION AND THE STEERS
MILDLY WONDERING HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
IN VAIN DID FLY OR MOTH OR THE MOST SEDUCTIVE SQUIRMER OF A FAT GRUB COME CIRCLING SLOWLY OVER THE SURFACE ABOVE THEM
THE NEW ARRIVAL HAD COME BY WAY OF THE RIVER AND FROM HIS BEARING THE POOL WAS EVIDENTLY NEW TO HIM
YET FOR ALL HIS CLUMSINESS HIS GOOD-WILL WAS SO UNCHANGING THAT NONE OF THE FARMYARD KINDREDS HAD ANY DREAD OF HIM SAVING ONLY THE PIG IN HIS STY
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT UNSEEN AND UNWELCOME COMPANIONSHIP BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE LEAFAGE HE QUICKENED HIS PACE GRADUALLY GROWING EVER MORE AND MORE EAGER TO REACH HIS RIFLE AND TAKE VENGEANCE FOR THE TROUBLING OF HIS JOURNEY
THAT MOMENT'S CLASH OF SNARLING JAW ON JAW HAD SEEMED TO LET IN A FLASH OF UNDERSTANDING UPON THEIR HOT HEARTS
HIS SUPREMACY HAD BEEN FATAL TO MANY SMALLER FISH BEFORE
UP WENT HIS GUN AGAIN TO THE SHOULDER
HE'S GOING TO VISIT THE TOP OF OLD BALD FACE WENT THE MURMUR ROUND THE CROWDED EDGES OF THE FIELD
THE DAYS WERE NOW HOT AND CLOUDLESS AND SO DRY THAT THE HOST SEEMED LITERALLY TO DRINK UP EVERY BROOK OR POND IT PASSED AND AN IRRITATING DUST-CLOUD OVERHUNG THE REAR OF THE TRAMPLING HOOFS
HIS APPETITE CRAVED A THICK HOT SOUP OF PEMMICAN BUT HE HAD A FEELING THAT THE ENTICING SMELL OF SUCH A MEAL ON THE ICY AIR MIGHT MAKE THE WOLVES FORGET THEIR DEFERENCE TO HIS PROTECTOR
HE SAW NO MORE OF THAT ENEMY BUT HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAWNY FORM OF THE PUMA GLIDING INTO A TREE
THEN HIS STRAINING EARS CAUGHT--VERY FAINTLY AND ELUSIVELY AS THE IMPERCEPTIBLE AIRS OF THE FOREST DREW THIS WAY AND THAT--THE DRY CLASH OF OPPOSING ANTLERS
THEN FEELING THAT THE GAME WAS CARRIED ON UNDER A SURVEILLANCE WHICH HE COULD NEITHER LOCATE NOR EVADE HE SUDDENLY QUITTED IT AND FELL BACK UPON AN ATTITUDE OF CONTEMPTUOUS INDIFFERENCE
BUT LATER IN THE DAY AS HE GLANCED AT HIS PARTNER'S DRAWN SALLOW-WHITE FACE BRANNIGAN'S HEART MISGAVE HIM
THE COW APPARENTLY SO HEEDLESS HAD BEEN WIDEAWAKE ENOUGH AND HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER ASSAILANT FROM THE TAIL OF HER EYE JUST IN TIME TO AVOID THE FULL FORCE OF THE ATTACK
THE SORREL HORSE CATCHING A WHIFF OF HIS PUNGENT SCENT LOOKED AROUND AT HIM SUDDENLY AND SNORTED
NOW IT HAD CHANCED SOME DAYS EARLIER THAN THIS THAT IN ONE OF THE LODGES BY THE MICHIKAMAW A CHILD HAD FALLEN SICK
THEN AS IF BY COMMON CONSENT THEY SPRANG APART AND BEGAN A SLOW WARY CIRCLING EACH IMPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF THE OTHER'S PROWESS
AS IT PASSED OVER A RED BRICK COTTAGE AT ONE CORNER OF THE FIELD QUITE BLOTTING IT FROM VIEW FOR AN INSTANT HE GOT AN IMPRESSION OF ITS INCREDIBLE SIZE AND FELT WITH A PANG OF ANGRY DREAD THAT HIS OWN STATELY DIMENSIONS WOULD HAVE SEEMED LITTLE BETTER THAN A SPARROW'S BESIDE IT
WHETHER AS ALL THE TRIBE TOOK FOR GRANTED IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME WOLF A MAGIC BEAST FOREVER YOUNG AND VIGOROUS OR WHETHER THE GRIM WARDER WHO HAD PRESIDED OVER THE CHILD'S BIRTH HAD BEQUEATHED HIS MYSTERIOUS OFFICE TO A DESCENDANT LIKE HIMSELF IS A POINT THAT NEED NOT BE DECIDED
HE WAS ALMOST UPON IT BEFORE HIS PLANES BIT UPON SOLID AIR AGAIN AND GLIDED OFF FROM THE PERIL SLANTING UPWARD ROCKINGLY OVER A GAPING ABYSS
HE TURNED AND MADE OFF STRAIGHT UP THE STEEP TILL HE HAD PUT A GOOD MILE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE POINT OF DANGER
BUT IN THAT BRACING AUTUMN AIR AMID THOSE CRISP SHADOWS FLECKED WITH OCTOBER'S GOLD MCLAGGAN WAS LITTLE CONSCIOUS OF THE WEIGHT OF HIS PACK AND HIS CORDED MUSCLES FELT NO FATIGUE
TO WOOF A HUMAN HABITATION STOOD FOR FRIENDLINESS AND FOOD AND SHELTER
NOW HOWEVER HE WAS ON THE SUDDEN QUITE CONVINCED OF IT
AND THEY HAD THEIR FOOD SUPPLIES LAID BY WITH WISE FORETHOUGHT IN THE SEASON WHEN FOOD WAS ABUNDANT
THE ODDS HOWEVER WERE NOW LAID HEAVILY AGAINST THE FUGITIVE
HE HAD REACHED THE INDIAN COUNTRY AND HIS PLACE ON THE FLANK OF THE HOST AS HIS CRAFT AND EXPERIENCE TOLD HIM WAS NO LONGER A SAFE ONE
IN THIS REMOTE CORNER OF THE ROCKIES THE HUNTER'S RIFLE WAS AS YET PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN
HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN SPACIOUS WIGWAM OF BIRCH BARK WITH THE CROSSED POLES PROJECTING ABOVE THE ROOF
I'LL BE JIGGERED SAID HE EF TAIN'T THAT THERE TAME B'AR JABE SMITH OVER TO EAST FORK USED TO HAVE AFORE HE WAS BURNT OUT CLIMBING CONFIDENTLY FROM THE BUNK HE PROCEEDED TO POUR A GENEROUS PORTION OF MOLASSES OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE SCRAP PAIL BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT BEARS HAD A SWEET TOOTH
THE SMELL OF HER MOTHER ON THOSE FINGERS REASSURED HER MIGHTILY
THERE WAS THE MAN AT BAY WITH HIS BACK TO IT
THIS PROCESS NOT ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND GLANCED ABOUT HIM WITH A WORRIED AIR HIS FAITH IN HIS OWN PROWESS APPARENTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME SHAKEN
AT THE EDGE OF THE POOL SHE STOPPED
THEN AN OLD BRAVE THE CHILD'S UNCLE WHO HAD BEEN MUCH ABOUT THE POSTS OF THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY WHICH ARE SCATTERED OVER LABRADOR SAID THAT THE WHITE MAN'S MEDICINE WAS A MAGIC TO CURE ALL DISEASE AND THAT IF THE LITTLE ONE COULD BUT COME TO ONE OF THE POSTS HIS LIFE WOULD SURELY BE SAVED
BUT HER EAR HAD CAUGHT THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE MOUNTAIN
HE HAD COME UP TO X PRIMARILY TO TURN A NEEDED PENNY BY EXHIBITION FLIGHTS AND PASSENGER-CARRYING OVER THE SPACIOUS AND LEVEL FIELDS BEHIND THE TOWN
TWO OR THREE MINUTES MORE AND THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS DARKENED
HE HEAPED WOOD ON THE FIRE WITH WHAT WAS FOR AN INDIAN LAVISH RECKLESSNESS
AS HE STRUGGLED SAVAGELY TO MAKE GOOD HIS HOLD AGAINST THE PLUNGING AND THE THRASHING ANTLERS OF HIS ANTAGONIST ONCE MORE THE PEPPER IN HIS NOSTRILS BEGAN TO WORK WITH POWER
THEY FILLED HIM WITH AWE AND WONDER BUT HE HAD NO FEAR OF THEM FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DONE NO TRESPASS AGAINST THE TRADITIONS
ALMOST FURTIVELY SHE LIFTED THE HEAVY LATCH AND OPENED THE DOOR HALF-WAY
SO YE'RE GOIN TO BE MARY'S MA EH HE DRAWLED WITH AMIABLE SARCASM
JEFF WAS LYING DOWN IN THE SNOW LICKING HIS OUTRAGEOUS WOUNDS AND CONTENT TO LEAVE THE FINISHING OF THE AFFAIR IN HIS MASTER'S HANDS
THEY WERE PERPLEXED TOO BY THE FIERCE WIND WHICH STREAMED OUT BEHIND ITS LEVEL WINGS
HIS LONG SINUOUS DARK BODY LAY CROUCHED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ENTRANCE HINDER HALF IN THE WATER AND HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT OF IT
WITH THAT LIGHTNING SIDE-SNAP WHICH HE HAD INHERITED FROM HIS COLLIE ANCESTORS THE DOG MANAGED TO SLASH BOTH HIS OPPONENTS SEVERELY IN THE SPACE OF HALF A SECOND
HE DROPPED HIS HEAD AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE NARROW TABLE-LIKE LEDGE JUST BELOW HIS PINNACLE WHERE ANOTHER RAM SMALLER AND LESS SPLENDIDLY HORNED THAN HIMSELF WITH SIX LITTLE SPIKE-HORNED EWES CROPPED THE SHORT SWEET GRASSES WHICH GREW IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCK
AS THE DANGEROUS-LOOKING SLUMBERER SEEMED TO BE IN THE WAY--NONE OF THE MEN CARING TO SIT TOO CLOSE TO HIM--TO THEIR AMAZEMENT THE COOK SMACKED THE MIGHTY HINDQUARTERS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND AND BUNDLED HIM UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO A CORNER
BUT IT WAS NOT THE COARSE-FLESHED SUCKERS THAT THIS DISCRIMINATING FISHERMAN WAS AFTER
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE SHRUNKEN HOST FORDED THE RIVER WHICH AT THIS POINT TURNED SHARPLY WESTWARD ACROSS THE PATH OF THE MIGRATION
WHILE THE INNER PORTION RIGHT UP TO THE PERPENDICULAR BANKS AND THE JUTTING TREE-ROOTS WAS FLOORED WITH SILTED MUD FRUITFUL IN THE SMALL EPHEMERAL WATER-GROWTHS OF HERB AND INSECT
IT LOOKED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO DIVE INTO SPACE
SISSY DRAGGED HER BENCH AND BUNDLE STILL FURTHER AWAY AND SAT PHILOSOPHICALLY WARMING HER WET FEET
IN HIS WORLD OF THE ARCTIC BARRENS NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A NEST WOULD EVER BE BUILT IN SUCH AN EXPOSED POSITION WHERE THE FIRST ICY HURRICANE SCREAMING DOWN FROM THE POLE WOULD RIP IT TO SHREDS
THE OLD BRAVE WAS HIMSELF HUNGERING FOR AN EXCUSE TO GET AWAY TO THE WARMTH WHICH WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE DWELLINGS OF THE WHITE MAN AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE LITTLE ONE OUT TO NORTH WEST RIVER TO BE HEALED
BUT THEY WERE FAR TOO SAGACIOUS TO ATTACK AND FORCE A MORE THAN DOUBTFUL CONFLICT
THE TALL FIGURE AT FIRST BENT WITH FATIGUE STRAIGHTENED ITSELF UP DEFIANTLY LIFTED A MUSKET AND FIRED AT A BUNCH OF WOLVES JUST SPRINGING FROM THE WOODS ON HIS LEFT
IT ENDED IN A SCREECH OF RAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT AS HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE ROLLING ON THE GROUND STRIKING OUT BLINDLY WITH FUTILE CLAWS
IT WAS PERHAPS A HALF-HOUR LATER WHEN A BIG BLACK MINK CAME POKING HIS POINTED NOSE INTO THE THICKET
AT LAST HOWEVER ABOUT NOON HE CAME UPON THEIR TRAIL LEADING DOWN TO THE GRASS
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL HOWEVER IN ITS LONESOME PALLID WISTFUL FASHION FOR ITS HUMMOCKS WHERE DRY ENOUGH WERE ALREADY BLUING TENDERLY WITH THE FIRST VIOLETS ITS FRINGES WERE SPARSELY ADORNED WITH THE SHY BLOOMS OF WIND-FLOWER DOG-TOOTH AND HEPATICA AND SCATTERED THROUGH THE DARK RANKS OF THE FIR TREES ON EITHER SIDE WERE LITTLE COLONIES OF WHITE BIRCH OR SILVER POPLAR JUST FILMING WITH THE FIRST INEFFABLE GREEN
SO NARROW A MARGIN WAS IT INDEED THAT HE CAUGHT HIS BREATH WITH A GASP BEFORE SHE LIFTED
THE BOSS OF THE CAMP HOWEVER WAS OF A DIFFERENT TYPE--A DRIVING HARD-EYED WESTERNER ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTROL OF LUMBER GANGS OF MIXED RACES AND HIS HEART WAS AS ROUGH AS HIS TONGUE
HERE HE WRITES FOR BOYS PARTICULARLY STILL OF THE CREATURES OF THE FORESTS AND STREAMS BUT WITH A BOY AS THE CENTRAL HUMAN FIGURE
ON THE FLEXIBLE COIL OF HER NECK HER HEAD PIVOTED PERFECTLY AND FROM WHICHEVER QUARTER THE ENEMY APPROACHED THERE WAS THAT FIERY YELLOW POINT ALWAYS CONFRONTING HIM WAITING TO DART UPWARD AND MEET HIM FULL IN THE BREAST
THEN BETHINKING HIMSELF OF THE SERIOUS BUSINESS WHICH HE HAD IN HAND HE PICKED IT UP AND TROTTED OFF TO A DRY SPOT WHICH HE KNEW OF JUST ON THE FRINGE OF THE ISLAND
WITHOUT A GLANCE AT THE MAN WHOM HE HAD SAVED WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT STALKED FORWARD AND FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN UPON THE BODY OF THE WHITE WOLF IMPLORING IT TO PARDON WHAT HE HAD DONE
PETE ALLEN FELL SPRAWLING SOME EIGHT OR TEN FEET DOWN THE SLOPE LOSING HOLD OF HIS RIFLE IN THE EFFORT TO STOP HIMSELF
THE SORREL HORSE UNDER THE BIRCH-TREE SWUNG ROUND ON HIS TETHER AND ROLLED HIS EYES AND SNORTED DEEPLY SCANDALIZED AT SUCH GOINGS-ON ABOUT HIS FAMILIAR WAGON
IN FOUR FOOT O SOFT SNOW AN NO SNOWSHOES ABOUT TEN THOUSAN MILE REPLIED BRANNIGAN CONSOLINGLY
BRANNIGAN WHO HAD NEVER LOST GRIP OF HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A GOOD-NATURED GRIN
HIS SHAGGY EYEBROWS KNITTED THEMSELVES OVER THE PROBLEM TILL LONG JACKSON TRUDGING AT HIS SIDE DEMANDED TO KNOW IF HE'D GOT THE BELLYACHE THIS BEING JUST THE AFFLICTION WHICH HE WAS DREADING FOR THE CALF BRANNIGAN FELT A PANG OF GUILT AND VOUCHSAFED NO REPLY
BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS PAST NOON ITS DOWNPOUR REACHED AND FLOODED THE SURFACE AND MADE VERY WHOLESOME BASKING
BUT THE FOX HAD NO THOUGHT OF RETURNING
THERE WAS THE TRAIL OF THE FLOCK LEADING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STEEPEST AND MOST UNINVITING OF THE GLENS
FLYING IN WIDE CIRCLES ABOVE A GREEN FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY WAS A GIGANTIC BIRD IN FORM AND STATURE QUITE UNLIKE ANY OTHER BIRD THAT THE GREAT EAGLE HAD EVER SEEN
I HADN'T NO SORT OF AN APPETITE I'VE GOT ME OLD DUDHEEN SAID BRANNIGAN HOLDING UP HIS STUBBY BLACK CLAY
HATCH SWORE SOFTLY AND TURNED BACK INTO THE HOMEWARD TRAIL
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO WIN THE FAVOR OF THE STRANGELY UNRESPONSIVE ROUND-FACED MAN IN THE BUNK
ONCE THEY THOUGHT OF PUTTING THIS JOB UPON MARY
BUT HIS KINDLY DISPOSITION SHRANK FROM THE BARBARITY OF THE PROCESS
JEFF SEEING THAT HIS MASTER WAS DOWN SPRANG TO HIS SIDE WHINING AND FELL TO LICKING FRANTICALLY AT HIS UNCONSCIOUS FACE
THE LOOK OF FEAR FADED FROM HIS YELLOW EYES LEAVING THE RAGE ONLY
SINCE THEIR FIRST SIGHT OF THE GIANT-WINGED MONSTER SOARING AND HUMMING OVER X THE EAGLES OF BALD FACE HAD NOT DARED TO VENTURE FAR FROM HOME IN THEIR FORAGINGS
ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER FORLORN OF HEART AND EXIGENT OF BELLY WOOF FOUND HIMSELF IN A PART OF THE FOREST WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
THEN AT LAST A WHITE-HEADED EAGLE PASSING LOW OVERHEAD YELPED AT HIM DEFIANTLY
FINDING THAT THE INSIGNIFICANT BUT OBSTINATE THING WOULD NOT LET GO HE LOWERED HIS ANTLERS AND STRUCK AT IT INDIGNANTLY WITH ONE OF HIS HINDER HOOFS
NO THERE MUST BE--THERE WAS--SOMETHING TO DO IF SHE COULD ONLY THINK OF IT
AS HIS BRAIN GROPED AFTER IT SUDDENLY A LONG THIN HOWLING FILLED HIS EARS WHETHER THE VOICE OF THE WIND OR THE VOICE OF A WOLF HE COULD NOT TELL
NOTHING SEEMED ASTIR BUT THE TWO OR THREE NIGHT-HAWKS SWOOPING AND TWANGING HIGH UP IN THE HOLLOW HEAVEN AND HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF HUNTING ANY SUCH ELUSIVE QUARRY AS THE NIGHT-HAWKS
FLUSHING WITH SHAME HE CONSIGNED HIS FOLLY AND ALL LYNXES TO THE PLACE OF ETERNAL TORMENT HITCHED HIS OLD SORREL MARE TO THE DRAG AND SET OUT AFTER THOSE SUPERIOR POLES WHICH GREW BELOW SUGAR LOAF
AND A LARGE BLUE-BOTTLE ALIGHTED UPON IT
ON THE ULTIMATE HEIGHTS THEREFORE WHERE NONE COULD FOLLOW HIM BUT THE EAGLES AND THE FALCONS HE HAD NO ENEMIES TO KEEP WATCH AGAINST
THAT STEEL-MUSCLED THIGH WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS JAWS LEAVING HIM WITH AN EMBARRASSING MOUTHFUL OF DOWN
IT MADE A SWEEPING HALF-CIRCUIT OF THE COLONY AND THEN SAILED ON TOWARD THE MERE OF THE WHITE SWANS
SHE SHUDDERED AND GATHERED HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A DESPERATE SPRING EXPECTING THE LATCH OR THE HINGES TO GIVE WAY
AND PRESENTLY THE FLOCK WAS PASTURING GREEDILY ON SUCH SWEET HERBAGE AS THEY HAD NOT TASTED SINCE THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHILE ON A HUMMOCK NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE GLADE AT THE POST OF DANGER THE RAM KEPT WATCH TURNING HIS HEAD CONTINUALLY
HE SWUNG ABOUT GLIDED BACK TO THE POOL SLID INTO IT AND SNATCHED UP ONE OF THE FISH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY SLAIN
HIS PATH WAS THE OPEN SNOW-SHEETED CHANNEL OF A LITTLE RIVER WITH THE FIR WOODS CROWDING DOWN TO ITS BRINK ON EITHER SIDE
FOR ALL ITS APPALLING SPEED THE SOUND OF HIS FLIGHT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A STRONG PULSATING HISS
HE FELT SURE NOW OF WINNING THE LONGED-FOR TROPHY OF THAT MAGNIFICENT HEAD AND OF WINNING IT MOREOVER BY HIS OWN UNAIDED WOODCRAFT
WELL SAID HE THERE AIN'T NO PROPERTY RIGHT IN A MOOSE ANYHOW WE THINK THER BE REPLIED BRANNIGAN AN WE KNOW THAT THERE LITTLE MOOSE-COW'S OUR'N AN NOT FER SALE AT NO PRICE WHAT-_SO-EVER THE BOSS WAS BEGINNING TO GET ANGRY AT THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE ATTITUDE OF HIS GUESTS
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE CAST A LOOK OF DREAD INTO THE VISTAED SHADOWS OF THE FIR TREES
BUT THIS WAS NO EXTENUATION OF THEIR CRIME IN JOHN HATCH'S EYES
THEN HE SNATCHED THE HEAVIEST WRENCH FROM HIS TOOL KIT AND TURNED IN A RAGE TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH HIS TORMENTORS
AS THE FRANTIC FUGITIVES DASHED THIS WAY AND THAT WEAVING STRANGE PATTERNS OVER THE BOTTOM AND HALF FORGETFUL IN THEIR TERROR OF THE NARROW WAY OUT TO SAFETY THE OTTER SLASHED AT SUCH AS CAME IN HIS WAY BITING THROUGH THEIR BACKBONES SO THAT THEY PRESENTLY ROLLED TO THE SURFACE BELLY UPWARD

THESE MEN KNEW THE BISON AND HIS DEEP-ROOTED HABITS
THE COOK WAS A POOR SHOT AT ANY TIME AND AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS AT A SPECIAL DISADVANTAGE
IT WAS DECIDED THEREFORE TO CHECK THE SOUTHWARD MARCH OF THE HOST BY SPLITTING IT UP INTO SECTIONS AND SCATTERING IT TO THIS SIDE AND THAT THUS DEPRIVING IT OF THE UNITED MIGRANT IMPULSE AND LEAVING ITS DESTRUCTION TO BE COMPLETED AT MORE LEISURE
HE WAS SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DYING FIRE
HE LEFT THEM THEREFORE WITH A COLLECTION OF NEATLY SEVERED HEADS AND TAILS TO MOCK THE FISHERMEN WHEN THEY SHOULD RETURN AT SUNSET
HER HEART YEARNED TO IT AT ONCE
FOR TWO DAYS IN HER BOX IN A CORNER OF THE DUSKY STABLE THE BROWN MOTHER HAD WISTFULLY POURED OUT HER TENDERNESS UPON THE ONE REMAINING PUPPY
BUT BEFORE HE HAD QUITE GLUTTED HIS GREAT APPETITE HE WAS INTERRUPTED
THE GREAT WOLF COCKED HIS EARS AT THE SOUND AND GAZED AT THE MAN INQUIRINGLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO
AND THEN WHEN SHE HAD RUN INTO THE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT TO SNATCH A BITE OF BREAKFAST ONE OF SMITH'S BIG RED OXEN HAD STROLLED INTO THE STABLE AND BLUNDERED A GREAT SPLAY HOOF INTO THE BOX
EVEN AS THE GREAT BEAST SPRANG THE MAN'S GUN LEAPED TO ITS PLACE AND HE FIRED
THE BROAD SOUTHEASTERN FACE OF THE SUMMIT WAS OF NAKED GRANITE WHITENED BY THE STORM AND FROST OF AGES WHENCE THE NAME OF OLD BALD FACE
AT NIGHT THEY DECIDED THAT ONE OF THE PRECIOUS MATCHES MUST BE USED
FILLED WITH RIGHTEOUS WRATH HE RUSHED FORWARD AND HURLED HIMSELF UPON THE SLAYER
THE VISITOR WIPED THE BLACK SICKLE OF HIS BEAK ON A BLOCK OF DRIFTWOOD GLARED ABOUT HIM AND THEN ROSE SOFTLY INTO THE AIR
THE BACK OF THE WAGON CONSISTED OF A HINGED FLAP AND THE FISHERMEN HAD LEFT IT HANGING DOWN
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH A STICKY AND UNPALATABLE GRUEL MADE BY STIRRING A COUPLE OF HANDFULS OF FLOUR INTO THE BOILING TEA AND HE FELT A REASONABLE CONFIDENCE THAT THE SMELL OF SUCH FARE WOULD PROVE NO IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION TO WOLFISH NOSTRILS
SHE MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS HIS NARROW LINE OF VISION AND VANISHED
HE SAW NOTHING MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A COUPLE OF INDIFFERENT SKUNKS AND A SURLY OLD PORCUPINE WHICH RATTLED ITS QUILLS AT HIM
BUT DURING THE LONG SUNLESS WINTERS WITH THEIR WILD SNOWS THEIR YELLING GALES THEIR INTERMINABLE NIGHT AND THEIR SUDDEN DESCENTS OF STILL INTENSE FROST SO BITTER THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE INCALCULABLE COLD OF OUTER SPACE WERE INVADING THIS UNDEFENDED OUTPOST OF THE WORLD THEN BLUE FOX AND HIS FELLOWS WOULD HAVE HAD A SORRY TIME OF IT BUT FOR TWO CONSIDERATIONS
THE VICTOR STOOD GLARING AFTER HIM FOR HALF A MINUTE SNORTING AND SHAKING HIS TRIUMPHANT ANTLERS
HIS DESCRIPTIONS ARE SO VIVID THAT YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE TANG OF THE FROSTY AIR THE BITING STING OF THE SNOWY SLEET BEATING ON YOUR FACE YOU CAN HEAR THE CRUNCH OF THE SNOW BENEATH YOUR FEET AND WHEN AFTER HEARTLESSLY EXPOSING YOU TO THE ELEMENTS HE LETS YOU WANDER INTO CAMP WITH THE CHARACTERS OF THE STORY YOU STRETCH OUT AND BASK IN THE WARMTH AND CHEER OF THE FIRE."--_WESTERN REVIEW KINGS IN EXILE THE MACMILLAN FICTION LIBRARY ILLUSTRATED
LOOKING ABOUT HIM ANXIOUSLY HE ESPIED A PAIR OF GREASY COWHIDE LARRIGANS LYING ON THE FLOOR NEAR THE DOOR
BUT THE WHISTLE WAVERED OUT IN A THIN BREATH AS HE FELT ONCE MORE THAT HATED CREEPING OF THE SKIN THAT CRAWLING AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK
EAGERLY SHE CALLED TO THEM WITH A HARSH BUT POIGNANT MEW AND IN TWO PRODIGIOUS LEAPS SHE WAS LEANING OVER THEM
IN SOME INEXPLICABLE UNDERHANDED WAY SHE MANAGED TO SET FIRE TO THE CABIN IN THE NIGHT WHEN BRANNIGAN AND JACKSON WERE SNORING HEAVILY
THEREUPON HE TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION THAT ALLEN SHOULD NOT SEE HIM
FOR SOMETIMES IN THE STILL DARK OF THE NIGHT WHEN BRANNIGAN AND LONG JACKSON WERE SNORING IN THEIR HOT BUNKS WITHIN THE CABIN SHE WOULD SEE AN OBSCURE BLACK SHAPE PROWLING STEALTHILY AROUND THE PEN AND HUNGRY EYES WOULD GLARE IN UPON HER THROUGH THE BARS
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT HAD MADE GOOD GOING AND WAS EATING UP THE LONG MILES OF HIS JOURNEY
GIVE US ONE O THEM TWO MATCHES O YOURN LONG SAID HE
AND SHE FELT SURE THAT IN DAYLIGHT HER ENEMY WOULD NOT DARE TO RENEW THE ATTACK
ROBERTS AUTHOR OF KINGS IN EXILE NEIGHBORS UNKNOWN THE FEET OF THE FURTIVE ETC
HE SCRAMBLED FOR IT FURIOUSLY
THE GREAT GRAY WOLVES HE SCORNED
AY AY AGREED JACKSON
IT WAS DEEP
OVER ALL THE FACE OF THE LONELY BACKWOODS WORLD WAS WASHED THE HIGH THIN GREEN OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK MAY-TIME UNDER A SKY OF CRYSTAL COBALT DOTTED WITH DENSE WHITE FLEECES
IN VENGEFUL SILENCE THEY FELL UPON THE THIEF AS HE FEASTED CARELESSLY
A STRONG PEN THEREFORE WAS BUILT FOR HER AGAINST THE END WALL OF THE CABIN VERY OPEN AND AIRY BUT ROOFED AGAINST THE RAIN AND IMPERVIOUS TO PREDATORY CLAWS
IT CAUGHT HIM ASLANT OR IT WOULD HAVE SHATTERED THE GREAT JOINT BEYOND HOPE OF RECOVERY
HE DESPISED ALL LYNXES AS CORDIALLY AS HE HATED THEM
HE KNEW THAT THE WHITE WOLF'S HOWLING HAD AWAKENED HIM AND SAVED HIM FROM BEING FROZEN TO DEATH
AGAINST THE ANCIENT ENEMIES THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF WARFARE HAD BEEN EFFICACIOUS ENOUGH AND THE HERDS HAD MULTIPLIED TILL THE PLAINS WERE BLACK WITH THEIR MARCHING MYRIADS
12MO $1.50 NET THE BACKWOODSMEN SHOWS THAT THE WRITER KNOWS THE BACKWOODS AS THE SAILOR KNOWS THE SEA
HE HAD TO BE NOISELESS AS A MINK BECAUSE HE KNEW BY HEARSAY THAT THE EARS OF THE MOUNTAIN RAM WERE ALMOST AS KEEN AS AN OWL'S
HE HAD PENETRATED INTO ONE OF THE SCREENED RUNWAYS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SPHAGNUM
AND THE SHADOWS--FOR THERE SEEMED TO JOHN HATCH TO BE TWO OF THEM HAUNTING HIM NOW--WOULD FADE OFF ELUSIVELY INTO THE ENVIRONING AND SOUNDLESS SHADE
HUNTING HAD BEEN BAD AND HE WAS HUNGRY
SHE COLLAPSED LIKE A SACK OF SHAVINGS HER LONG DARK MUZZLE WITH RED TONGUE PROTRUDING TURNED UPWARD AND BACKWARD AS IF SHE STARED IN HORROR AT HER DOOM
THEN A FAINT DELECTABLE SAVOR DRAWN ACROSS THE SHARP STILL AIR MET HIS NOSTRILS
TO THE LYNX WITH HIS MORE FIERY BUT LESS TENACIOUS TEMPERAMENT THIS VERY DELIBERATE AND LONG-DRAWN-OUT APPROACH WAS MORE TRYING THAN A SAVAGE RUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN
BUT BEFORE HE COULD QUITE GET HIS GRIP UPON IT IT SLIPPED THROUGH THE BRANCHES AND DROPPED ANOTHER DOZEN FEET OR SO
A SLOW STROKE OR TWO RESTORED HIM TO HIS FORMER LEVEL WITH IMPETUS TO SPARE FOR HIS SPLENDID EFFORTLESS SOARING
HE TURNED FROM GRUBBING UP AN ANT STUMP AND HEADED STRAIGHT BACK FOR HOME
INSTEAD OF CLUTCHING THE VICTIM'S NECK AND HOLDING IT SECURELY HE DEALT MERELY A GLANCING BLOW UPON THE BACK BEHIND THE WINGS
BUT THE OTTER WAS NO LONGER PROVOCATIVE
HE WAS LOW ENOUGH NOW TO SATISFY HIMSELF THAT THE PLATEAU AFFORDED A GOOD LANDING SO HE DIPPED HIS DESCENT TO A STEEPER ANGLE MAKING HASTE TO GET THROUGH THE SUSPENSE
SHE HAD SMALL HOPE OF ESCAPE BUT HER BRAIN WORKED CALMLY AND CLEARLY
THERE ACROSS THE GLADE STOOD A TAWNY PUMA EYEING HIS DISCOMFITURE THROUGH NARROWED LIDS
HE TOOK NO PAINS TO CHOOSE AN EASY PATH THE UPPERMOST FRINGE OF GRASS WHERE IT THINNED AWAY INTO THE BROKEN ROCK WAS SCANTY AND STUNTED
HE DID NOT WANT ANY SUCH NOTION AS THAT TO GET ITSELF ESTABLISHED IN WOOF'S YOUNG BRAIN
BROWN BULL WHOSE HERD WAS JUST NOW IN THE FRONT RANK OF THE HOST STOOD MOTIONLESS FOR SOME SECONDS TILL HE HAD JUDGED THE EXACT DIRECTION OF THE SPINNING COLUMN
HE REALIZED THAT IN TRAVELING WITHOUT HIS RIFLE HE HAD FAIRLY COAXED THE UNEXPECTED TO HAPPEN
I WAS MISTAKEN IN YEH JEFF SAID JOHN HATCH AN I APOLOGIZE HANDSOME
HE HAD TWO INDIANS WITH HIM AS CARRIERS BUT HE WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE NO PART IN THIS HUNTING
HE THOUGHT ONLY OF BEING IN TIME TO SEE THE DUEL BETWEEN THE TWO BULL ELKS THE BATTLE FOR THE LORDSHIP OF THE HERD OF INDIFFERENT COWS
AND HE SPEEDILY LEARNED TO RESPOND TO IT
HE WAS TOO IMPOSING IN APPEARANCE TOO GORGEOUS IN APPAREL TOO BOLD AND VIGILANT IN DEMEANOR TO BE SO MISUNDERSTOOD
MARY BEWILDERED AND DAUNTED FOLLOWED CLOSE AT BRANNIGAN'S HEELS
STAGGERED FOR A FEW SECONDS BY THE SHOCK OF THE BULLET THE BEAST HAD HESITATED AND TURNED AROUND ON HIS TRACKS BITING AT THE WOUND
HE REMEMBERED THAT THEY WERE ALL IN THE CHEST BY THE DOOR
SEEM TO BE AS INTERESTED IN AEROPLANES AS ANY OF US HUMANS THOUGHT MACCREEDY AND GAVE HIS PLANES A LIFT THAT SHOULD CARRY HIM OVER THE PLATEAU AT A HEIGHT OF NOT MUCH OVER A HUNDRED FEET
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED THE BREATH BATTERED CLEAN OUT OF HIM IN HALF A MINUTE MORE HAD HE MAINTAINED THE HOPELESSLY UNEQUAL STRUGGLE
BUT THE HAWK WAS ALREADY CLOSE UPON HIM
I'LL BRING MY GUN ALONG NEXT TIME I'M OVER TO SUGAR LOAF HE MURMURED AN I'LL PUT A BALL THROUGH HER GUTS IF SHE DON'T KEEP OFF MY TRAIL HIS VEXATION WAS NOT MOLLIFIED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM THE SPRUCE WOODS INTO THE OPEN PASTURES OF HIS CLEARING AND SAW HIS FARMYARD BELOW HIM BASKING IN THE SUN HE FELT A DISTINCT SENSE OF RELIEF
THEN A NEW IDEA FLASHED INTO HIS CUNNING RED HEAD
AT THE EDGE OF A BUSH SOME THIRTY OR FORTY PACES DISTANT HE SAT DOWN ON HIS TAIL AND LOOKED AROUND WITH ELABORATE CARELESSNESS TO SEE WHAT HIS RIVAL WAS GOING TO DO
THE LONELINESS OF THESE UNENDING AND UNBROKEN PLAINS ROLLED OUT FLAT BENEATH THE LOW-HUNG SKY TO A HORIZON OF WHITE HAZE MIGHT HAVE WEIGHED DOWN EVEN SO DAUNTLESS A SPIRIT AS HIS HAD HE NOT TAKEN CARE TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST IT
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN GROPED FOR THE LITTLE FORM WHICH HAD BEEN LAID AT HER BREAST
REVOLVING HIS ROUND CATLIKE HEAD VERY SLOWLY UPON HIS SHOULDERS AS IF IT WERE MOVED BY CLOCKWORK HE SURVEYED HIS STRANGE SURROUNDINGS
THE DOOR GROANED AND CREAKED
IN A FURY THE HAWK SWOOPED AND STRUCK DOWNWARD
HE WAS SORRY BUT HE WAS NOT SURPRISED
THE LITTLE CLAWS DREW BLOOD AND JOHN HATCH WITHDREW HIS HAND WITH A LAUGH THAT HAD A TOUCH OF ADMIRATION IN IT
WHEN DURING THAT LONG AND SOLITARY FASTING ON THE HILLTOP THE YOUNG MAN'S FAINTING EYES SAW VISIONS OF AWE AND UNKNOWN PORTENT AND STRANGE PHANTASMAL SHAPES OF BEAST AND BIRD CAME FLOATING UP ABOUT HIM WITH EYES OF MENACE ALWAYS AT THE LAST MOMENT WOULD COME THAT PALLID PROWLING WARDER AND DRIVE THE GHOSTS AWAY
THAT POWERFUL AND CRAFTY CAT NOT FROM COWARDICE BUT FROM SAGACITY RECOGNIZED MAN FOR ITS MASTER AND WAS WONT TO GIVE HIM A WIDE BERTH WHENEVER POSSIBLE
EVEN FAT BACON THAT FAITHFUL STAND-BY WAS BEGINNING TO LOSE ITS CHARM AND TO SIZZLE AT THEM WITH AN UNSYMPATHETIC NOTE WHEN THE TROUT WERE FRYING IN IT
TO HIS RELIEF THEY SEEMED AFRAID TO FLY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF APPREHENDING THAT THIS MONSTROUS BIRD OF HIS MIGHT CARRY SOME TERRIBLE WEAPON IN ITS BLUNT-FACED BEAK
HE DESPISED MAN BECAUSE HE SAW THE PROUD AND CUNNING CREATURE CHAINED TO EARTH COMPELLED TO CRAWL UPON EARTH'S SURFACE EVEN AS A SHEEP OR A WOODCHUCK
HE HAD MARKED ANOTHER TRAIL UNDERLYING THAT OF THE WOLF-PACK
IT WAS A FALSE STROKE ON THE HERON'S PART FOR HER ASSAILANT WAS NOT QUITE WITHIN REACH
SHE FELT THAT THE EYES OF IT WOULD BE VISIBLE BY THEIR OWN LIGHT AND SHE SUMMONED UP ALL HER RESOLUTION THAT SHE MIGHT NOT SCREAM WHEN IT APPEARED
THE LONG WINGS OF THE HAWK BENT SHARPLY AT THE ELBOWS WORKED MORE SLOWLY BUT WITH A NERVOUS TERRIFIC THRUST WHICH URGED HIM THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A PROJECTILE
MARY WAS BAWLING WITH TERROR AND BOUNCING ABOUT IN HER PEN AS IF ALL THE FURIES WERE AFTER HER
IN A WORD THEY WERE HIS ENEMIES AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO HIS CODE TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT COMPUNCTION
SNATCHING UP ONE OF THE FRAGMENTS OF STOVE-PIPE SHE USED THE EDGE AS A SHOVEL AND CARRIED A PORTION OF THE BLAZING STUFF TO THE OPEN DOORWAY
BUT FOR THE MOST PART NONE BUT THOSE HERDS ACTUALLY ASSAILED PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON
HE HAD NO EYES EVEN FOR THE ARCH-FOE MAN IN THIS MOMENT OF HIS DEFEAT AND HUMILIATION
HE FLUNG BOTH ARMS AND LEGS ABOUT HIS BRANCH TO KEEP FROM FALLING AND CLUNG THERE GURGLING
CARTRIDGES ARE PRECIOUS WHEN ONE LIVES A FIVE-DAYS TRAMP FROM THE NEAREST SETTLEMENT
AT THAT THE COURAGE OF THE VALIANT FIGHTER WHOM NEITHER RIVAL BULL NOR PANTHER NOR MAN HIMSELF COULD DAUNT MELTED TO SKIM MILK
HIS EARS--SO SENSITIVE THAT HE COULD HEAR INNUMERABLE AND TELL-TALE SOUNDS WHERE A HUMAN EAR WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED NOUGHT BUT A DROWSY SILENCE--CAUGHT A CHORUS OF RUSTLINGS SQUEAKS AND RUSHES WHICH TOLD HIM THAT THE NEIGHBORING DEPTHS OF THE GRASS WERE POPULOUS WITH THE MOUSE FOLK AND THEIR KINDRED
DON'T YE BE SO BRASH LONG SAID HE
IN PARTICULAR HE SET HIMSELF TO REMOVE FROM HER MIND ANY LINGERING NOTION THAT SHE WOULD DO FOR A LAP-DOG
HE HAD ONCE BEEN NIPPED
THEN HE WENT OVER HIS PRECIOUS MACHINE MINUTELY TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT IT HAD SUSTAINED NO DAMAGE EXCEPT THAT SLIT IN ONE WING WHICH WAS NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE SERIOUS TROUBLE
THE CAN GAVE VOICE MORE CLAMOROUSLY
IT LAY GLISTENING IN A PATCH OF SUN
HAVING ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS WITH SUCH SURPRISING EASE HE SEEMED TO THINK HE MIGHT NOW SUCCEED IN GETTING AT MCLAGGAN HIMSELF
HE MADE HIS WAY TO A LITTLE WELL-LIKE POOL A SORT OF POCKET OF BLACK WATER IN A CLEFT OF THE GRANITE WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND NOTED CURIOUSLY ON HIS UPWARD CLIMB
HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF IT BUT FROM THE HABIT OF THE TRAINED HUNTER AND TRAPPER HE GAVE IT A SEARCHING SCRUTINY AS HE WENT
HE STIRRED A BRANCH HEAVILY SNOW-LADEN
FOR THERE WAS NO MORE WOOD IN SIGHT EXCEPT GREEN SPRUCE WHICH MADE BUT POOR AND PRECARIOUS BURNING UNLESS WITH PLENTY OF DRY STUFF TO URGE IT ON
BUT IN ONE INSTANCE--JUST ONE--THE PLAN OF THE SLAUGHTERERS DID NOT WORK OUT QUITE AS ANTICIPATED
AS HE STARED A PAIR OF IMMENSE ROUND EYES BRASS YELLOW AND TERRIBLE OPENED WIDE UPON HIM
JUST AS HE MADE HIS CAST HE SAW THE FLEEING DRAKE AND THE PURSUING HAWK COME ROUND THE BEND
THE BULL STAMPED SHARPLY ON THE SOD WITH ONE KNIFE-EDGED FORE-HOOF
THE BEST POLES AS HE KNEW GREW ON THE SHORES OF A LITTLE LAKE SOME MILES AWAY NEAR THE FOOT OF SUGAR LOAF
THEY SLEPT OF COURSE WELL CLAD
HIS EYES LIGHTED UP AT SIGHT OF THE UNGUARDED WAGON FROM TOWN AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE SITUATION AT A GLANCE
I S'POSE YE'RE RIGHT LADS AN IT WAS YER OWN FEED I WAS THINKING OF
IF THE BEAR SHOULD SUCCEED IN SQUEEZING THROUGH THE WINDOW OR BREAKING DOWN THE DOOR SHE WOULD LIGHT THE DRY STUFF AND PERHAPS THE SUDDEN BLAZE AND SMOKE MIGHT FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY
FOR SOME SECONDS HE STOOD THERE IN AN AGONY OF IRRESOLUTION HIS HEART DRAGGING HIM BOTH WAYS
FOR A FEW SECONDS MACCREEDY WAS TEMPTED TO DRIVE HIS PLANES HEAVENWARD AGAIN AND WITHDRAW FROM THE SITUATION TO RETURN ANOTHER DAY WITH A PASSENGER AND A SHOT-GUN FOR HIS DEFENSE
A FEW MOMENTS MORE AND A SPARKLE OF SUNLIGHT FLASHED INTO HIS EYES AND THROUGH THE SCREENING SPRUCE BRANCHES HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE QUIET WATER
IN THAT BROKEN COUNTRY OF WIDE-SOWN BOULDERS AND FANTASTIC OUTCROP WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT HAD REASON TO HOPE FOR A POST OF BETTER ADVANTAGE THAN THE OPEN TRAIL
WHY DID NOT THE FUGITIVE STOP AND MAKE READY SOME DEFENSE
HE WAS SURPRISED SOMEWHAT BY THE ATTITUDE OF THE EAGLES WHO WERE NOW CIRCLING NEARER AND SEEMED TO BE MORE ANGRY THAN CURIOUS OR TERRIFIED AT HIS APPROACH
JUST BEFORE NOON HE HALTED LIT A FIRE MADE HIMSELF A KETTLE OF TEA AFTER THE COMFORTING FASHION HE HAD LEARNED FROM THE WHITE MEN AND CHEWED A ROCKY MORSEL OF PEMMICAN WITHOUT TAKING TIME TO COOK IT
THE BASKET EMPTIED AND HIS FIRST RAGE GLUTTED THE MINK NOW FELL TO THE BUSINESS OF MAKING A SERIOUS MEAL
BUT AGAINST THE NEW FOE--THE WHITE MAN WITH HIS GUNS AND HIS CUNNING HIS COOL COURAGE AND HIS INSATIABLE GREED--IT HAD BEEN A DESTRUCTIVE FAILURE
MARY SAID HE YOU'VE LOST THE CHANCE O YER LIFE
AT NOON IN A DEEP TROUGH DUG WITH HIS SNOWSHOES IN THE SNOW AND WITH A GOOD FIRE AT HIS FEET HE HAD SLEPT SOUNDLY FOR TWO HOURS
FOR HOURS THE GIRL TRUDGED ON PICKING HER WAY LABORIOUSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE TRAIL AND OFTEN COMPELLED TO STOP AND MEND A BIT OF THE CORDUROY ROADWAY BEFORE SHE COULD GET ACROSS SOME PARTICULARLY BAD STRETCH OF BOG
JUST AT THE POINT WHERE THE SLOPE OF GRASS WAS INTERSECTED BY ANOTHER AND NARROWER GLADE ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE FIRST A HEEDLESS YOUNG EWE HAD BRANCHED OFF A SCORE OR SO OF PACES TO ONE SIDE UP THE CROSS-GLADE
HE HAD NO ROOTED OBJECTION TO THE MINK HAVING WHAT WAS LEFT
THE EAGLE WAS ALMOST PANIC-STRICKEN TO OBSERVE THAT EVEN NOW WHEN MOUNTING SO DIRECTLY IT DID NOT FLAP ITS WINGS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO WIND ON WHICH TO RISE
AND THEN THE LIGHT OF CERTAIN REMEMBERED RUMORS BROKE UPON HIS MEMORY
MOST OF THEM WERE MUCH TOO BIG NOT FOR HIS APPETITE BUT FOR HIS POWERS
DAMN YOU JIM CLANCY NONE O YER BUTCHERIN HE SHOUTED
HE ROUSED JACKSON WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
BUT JUST BEHIND HIM AND CLOSER IN TOWARD THE MAIN BODY OF THE HOST HE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HIS STRETCHED NERVES THRILL WITH ANGER
IT WAS ABOUT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN JOHN HATCH CROSSED THE LAST OF THE HALF-BARE SLOPES WITH THEIR SCANT GROWTH OF POPLAR AND SAPLING BIRCH WHICH FRINGED THE FOOT OF OLD SUGAR LOAF AND PLUNGED INTO THE DARK SPRUCE WOODS WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM HIS LONELY FARM ON THE BANKS OF BURNT BROOK
HE WAS THE UNDISPUTED TYRANT OF THE POLAR AIR EVEN THE DASHING WHITE CHOCOLATE-MOTTLED HAWK-OWL FLYING PRECIPITATELY BEFORE HIM
THE FLAVOR TO BE SURE WAS SOMETHING NEW AND NOVELTY IS A POOR RECOMMENDATION TO BABES OF WHATEVER KINDRED
HUGE AND APPARENTLY CLUMSY AS WAS THE BULK OF THE BEAR HE NEVERTHELESS MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE TANGLE AS SOUNDLESSLY AS THE MAN AND MORE SWIFTLY
SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF HOWEVER TO GROPE HER WAY INTO THE THICK DARKNESS OF THE INTERIOR
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THE PLACE EXCEPT FOR THE SMOKE RISING LIBERALLY FROM THE STOVE-PIPE CHIMNEY
IT WAS MID-MORNING AND THE CAMP COOK HAVING GOT HIS WORK DONE UP WAS SLEEPING IN HIS BUNK THE WHILE THE DINNER WAS BOILING
AT LAST SHE HAD HIM WORSTED
HE WAS AN EXPERT IN HUNTING THE SHY WOOD-MICE LYING PATIENTLY IN WAIT FOR THEM BESIDE THEIR HOLES AND OBLITERATING THEM AS THEY CAME OUT WITH A LIGHTNING STROKE OF HIS GREAT PAW
HALF A MINUTE LATER THE FUGITIVE BROKE OUT INTO THE TRAIL AND CAME DASHING DOWN IT WILD-EYED NOSTRILS BLOWING BLOODY FOAM AND FLANKS STREAMING CRIMSON
AS A RULE TWO WILD BEASTS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES IF SO NEARLY MATCHED THAT THE EVENT OF A COMBAT MIGHT BE DOUBTFUL WILL AVOID EACH OTHER DISCREETLY
BUT ALL WAS WARMTH AND PLENTY AT THE SNOW-DRAPED CABIN
MCLAGGAN STEPPED POLITELY ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS AND HE PASSED UNHEEDING
HIS SMALL UNFLINCHING EYES LOOKED OUT ACROSS THE MEAGER FLAMES THROUGH THE THIN REEK OF THE SMOKE AND MET CALMLY THE SCORES OF CRUEL NARROWED EYES GLARING UPON HIM GRIMLY FROM THE EDGES OF THE TIMBER
HE KNEW THAT IF THE ROBBER WAS MERELY DRIVEN OFF HE WOULD RETURN AND HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF THE COLONY AND END BY FINDING AND RIFLING EVERY STOREHOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE KNEW NOW TO A CERTAINTY THAT HE WAS BEING OBSERVED AND TRAILED
BUT YE MIGHT A TOOK IT AN WELCOME
FROM TIME TO TIME HE FED THE FIRE FRUGALLY AND CALCULATED THAT AT THIS RATE HE COULD MAKE HIS FUEL LAST THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
BUT HERE THE GREAT HORNED LEADER ELECTED TO DO HIS OWN PASTURING WHILE THE YOUNGER RAM STOOD GUARD
HE WOULD HAVE THOSE TROUT WHETHER THE HORSE LIKED IT OR NOT
THE OTTER THOUGH A FOUR-FOOTED LAND-DWELLER WAS REALLY MORE SWIFT AND AGILE IN THE WATER THAN ANY TROUT
FEIGNING DEATH WHICH INDEED WAS NO GREAT FEIGNING FOR HIM AT THAT MOMENT HE SUCCEEDED IN DECEIVING THE UNSOPHISTICATED WOOF WHO DREW BACK UPON HIS HAUNCHES TO CONSIDER HIS TRIUMPH
HAD HE BEEN CAPABLE OF FORMULATING HIS INDIFFERENT THOUGHTS UPON THE MATTER THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME SUCH FORM AS
HERE HE WOULD LIE IN WAIT FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME PATIENT AND IMMOBILE AS THE ROOT ON WHICH HE CROUCHED
AND ONE GREAT FISH THERE WAS WHO WAS FATALLY SUPREME
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT WONDERED IF THEY WERE HUNGRY
THE GRAY VISITOR NOTED WHAT A WEAPON CONFRONTED HIM AND PAUSED WARILY
IT'S NAWTHIN BUT THAT LYNX HE MUTTERED
THEIR TAILS AND THE RUFFS OF THEIR NECKS BRISTLED INSTANTLY AND WITH A FEEBLE SPITTING THEY TURNED AND CLAWED SAVAGELY AT THE INTRUDING HAND
BLUE FOX HIMSELF LIKE MOST OF HIS FULL-GROWN FELLOWS NEVER STIRRED
SLOWLY HE PICKED HIMSELF UP TO SEE HIS QUARRY AND THE GREAT RAM JUST VANISHING UP THE GLADE FAR BEYOND ANY SUCH PURSUIT AS HE WAS AT THE MOMENT EQUAL TO
BUT THIS MORNING HIS GAZE--THAT MIRACULOUS VISION WHICH COULD SCRUTINIZE A RABBIT OR AN AILING LAMB AT A DISTANCE WHEN OUR BEST EYES WOULD HARDLY DISCERN AN ELEPHANT--HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY AN APPARITION WHICH AMAZED AND DISCONCERTED HIM
AS HE RAN SWEATING IN HIS HARNESS IN SPITE OF THE INTENSE COLD HE STUDIED THE TRAIL OF THE WOLVES AND SAW THAT THE PACK WAS NOT A LARGE ONE--PERHAPS NOT MUCH BEYOND A SCORE IN NUMBER
LIFTING HER HEAD SUDDENLY SHE REALIZED HER ISOLATION AND STARTED TO REJOIN HER FELLOWS
BUT WHAT THE MINK DID NOT KNOW WAS HIS UNDOING
BEHIND THE BUSH HE MADE OUT WHAT LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT BE THE ENTRANCE TO A LITTLE CAVE
THE NESTS OF THE THREE ROYAL PAIRS WERE ALL WITHIN A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS HALF A MILE OF EACH OTHER BUT EACH WAS AUSTERELY SECLUDED AND JEALOUSLY HIDDEN FROM ITS NEIGHBORS
HE HAD WHISKED OUT TO INSPECT HIS STORES
THIS IMPULSE WAS QUELLED STERNLY BY HIS FATHER UNTIL THE LAD WAS OLD ENOUGH AND WISE ENOUGH TO RESTRAIN IT OF HIS OWN ACCORD
IN THE COURSE OF THE SUMMER BLUE FOX LIKE ALL HIS FELLOWS ESTABLISHED A NUMBER OF THESE LEMMING CACHES TILL BY THE TIME WHEN THE SOUTHWARD BIRD-FLIGHT PROCLAIMED THE SUMMER AT AN END THE QUESTION OF SUPPLY WAS ONE TO GIVE HIM NO FURTHER ANXIETY
THIS VISITATION LASTED FOR FIVE OR SIX DAYS AND THE TERROR IT CREATED SPREAD INWARDS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HOST
AT THIS FLAGRANT INTERFERENCE WITH HIS OWN LAWFUL KILL IT FLARED TO FURY
I'M THINKIN WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO WASTE STARIN AT BONFIRES AGREED BRANNIGAN
AND HAVING A VERY PRACTICAL CANADIAN AMBITION TO SURVIVE FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF THE FAME HE PLANNED TO WIN HE WAS DETERMINED TO PREPARE HIMSELF EFFECTIVELY FOR THE PERILS THAT WOULD CONFRONT HIM
HE ADJUSTED THE STRAPS OF HIS HEAVY PACK--THE CAUSE OF HIS LEAVING HIS RIFLE BEHIND--SO THAT HE COULD RID HIMSELF OF IT ON THE INSTANT IF NECESSARY AND HE CARRIED LOOSE A VERY EFFECTIVE WEAPON THE NEW AXE WHICH HE HAD JUST BOUGHT AT THE SETTLEMENT
ON THE FLANKS THEY ATTRACTED SMALL ATTENTION
THEN HE PUSHED ON EAGERLY
PRESENTLY HE WAS SO NEAR THAT HE COULD CATCH AMID THE CLASH OF ANTLERS OCCASIONAL GREAT WINDY SNORTINGS AND EXPLOSIVE GROANING GRUNTS
ONCE MORE HE HALF EMERGED FILLED HIS GASPING LUNGS AND POUNDED ONWARD DESPERATELY HALF FLYING AND HALF SWIMMING
BLIND BABIES THOUGH THEY WERE THE YOUNGSTERS KNEW THE TOUCH FOR AN ALIEN ONE THE UNKNOWN SMELL FOR THE SMELL OF AN ENEMY
HE SHOOK HIS ANTLERS INDIGNANTLY AND THE CAN THEREUPON THREW WIDER ITS SUAVE COILS OF RICHNESS TILL THEY LACED HIS NECK AND HIS GASHED FLANK
EF WE COULD LIVE ON BIRCH-BROWSE NOW I'D BE SO PROUD I WOULDN'T CALL THE KING MY UNCLE IF MARY WASN'T OUR PARD NOW SAID JACKSON WE'D BE ALL RIGHT
HE FELT HIS LONG KNIFE
THE SUCKERS LAZY PIG-LIKE INOFFENSIVE BEINGS CONGREGATED OVER THE STRETCH OF MUD FROM WHOSE FAT SURFACE THEIR SMALL ROUND DEFENSELESS DOWNWARD-OPENING MOUTHS SUCKED UP THEIR SUSTENANCE INCESSANTLY
THEREUPON--FOR THE MINK LACKS THE FOX'S HAIR-SPLITTING ASTUTENESS AND DOES NOT TAKE LONG TO MAKE UP ITS MIND--IT CLAMBERED NIMBLY UP THROUGH ONE OF THE WHEELS AND FELL STRAIGHTWAY UPON THE FISH-BASKET
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
THEY LIFTED THEIR HEADS DISCONTENTEDLY WHEREUPON THE OLD RAM WHOSE SUPERCILIOUS EYES NEVERTHELESS MISSED LITTLE OF WHAT CONCERNED HIM STEPPED MINCINGLY DOWN FROM HIS PINNACLE
THE NEXT INSTANT HE POUNCED WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE SPEED AND LIGHTNESS HIS HEAD AND FOREPAWS DISAPPEARING INTO THE MOSS
THEN THEY SLEPT FOR SOME HOURS
MACCREEDY AS HE CAME WITHIN A MILE OR TWO OF THE MOUNTAIN TOOK NOTE OF AN EAGLE NOT FAR AHEAD CIRCLING AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HIMSELF
HE KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MAN TO KNOW THEM THOROUGHLY BECAUSE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE INCALCULABLE ELEMENT OF INDIVIDUALITY TO MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR--AN ELEMENT THAT DELIGHTS IN CONFOUNDING THE DOGMATIC ASSERTIONS OF THE NATURALISTS
JEST AS YE LIKE LONG HE GRUNTED
IN A BLAZE OF FURY THEY FELL UPON HIM BOTH AT ONCE
HE CAME UNDER THE BRANCH ONCE MORE AND GLARED UPWARDS THROUGH WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PAIR OF WHITE GOGGLES SO THICKLY WERE HIS EYE-SOCKETS RIMMED WITH FLOUR
THE PRESENT WORK SHOULD PROVE A MOST ACCEPTABLE REMEMBRANCE TO EVERY BOY WHO CARES AND WHAT BOY DOES NOT FOR A HEARTY BOOK OF OUTDOOR LIFE
AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE LITTLE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF HIS OWN NECK CRAWLED AT THE IDEA
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS KINDER GUESS THAT SETTLES IT AGREED LONG JACKSON WITH A GRIN SPITTING ONCE MORE ON THE INVITING WHITE BOULDER
HE TRIED TO CHECK HIS CAST BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
BUT THE STATELY WATCHER KEPT HIS STATION IMMOVABLE STARING AS IF PHYSICALLY HYPNOTIZED BY THE IMMENSITY OF THE VISION THAT FILLED HIS EYES
THE FISHERMAN REELED IN THE LIMP COILS AND THE WORRIED HAWK FLEW OFF WITH THE FLIES
HIS TRAIL WAS NOW AN EASY ONE AN OLD AND MOSS-GROWN TOTE-ROAD OF THE LUMBERMEN
THERE IS NEVER A WORD TOO MUCH AND HE INVARIABLY STOPS WHEN THE STOP SHOULD BE MADE
NOW HE DID NOT ENTER INTO THEIR CALCULATIONS
MARY DIDN'T WANT TO GO AHEAD
ON SUCH OCCASIONS HATCH KNEW THAT THE UNSEEN SURVEILLANCE WAS WITHDRAWN BECAUSE HE HAD NONE OF THOSE WARNING CREEPS AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK
IN THE GRAY FISHING VILLAGE AT THE MOUTH OF THE NATASHQUOUAN CAME WORD TO WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT THAT CERTAIN OF THE SCATTERED BANDS OF HIS TRIBE IN THE INTERIOR WERE NEAR TO STARVING
IT WAS FAR OFF INDEED BUT ALREADY SO HIGH ABOVE EARTH THAT TO HER EYES IT STOOD OUT DARK AND SINISTER AGAINST THE PALE EXPANSE OF SEA BEYOND THE TOWN
WHAT WAS THE GREAT OWL TRYING TO GET AT WHEN THE PRECIOUS FISH WERE ALL SPREAD OUT BEFORE HER
HE OPENED HIS JAWS WIDE AND HISSED HARSHLY AND FOLLOWED THIS DEMONSTRATION BY A STRIDENT YOWL
HE MADE A GOOD MEAL THEREFORE UPON THE FLESH OF THE MINK THOUGH THAT FLESH IS SO TOUGH SO STRINGY AND SO RANK THAT FEW OTHER FLESH-EATERS WILL DEIGN TO TOUCH IT UNLESS IN THE EXTREMITY OF FAMINE
HE PONDERED ON THE FACT FOR A LITTLE AND THEN MUTTERING TO HIMSELF IT'S A PAINTER SURE HE RESUMED HIS JOURNEY
BUT THEY DID NOT TROUBLE TO COMPARE THEIR CALCULATIONS OR THEIR HOPES
DURING THE BRIEF BUT BRILLIANT ARCTIC SUMMER WHICH FLARED ACROSS THE LONELY WASTES WITH A FERVOR WHICH STROVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE WEARY DURATION OF ITS ABSENCE THE LIFE OF BLUE FOX WAS NOT ARDUOUS
IN THE CLEAR OPEN THEY COULD DROP LIKE A WEDGE OF STEEL AND FLICK UP A DARTING TROUT FROM THE VERY LIP OF THE FALL
HE TIPPED HIS SNOWY HEAD AND SHOULDERS FORWARD AND THE AIR HISSED SHARPLY IN THE TENSE WEB OF THE HINDER EDGES OF HIS WINGS AS HE SWEPT DOWN THE VIEWLESS SLOPES OF AIR TURNING UPWARDS AGAIN AFTER A SWOOP OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO WHICH WAS AS NOTHING AT THAT HEIGHT
IT WAS NO MORE THAN SECURE HOWEVER BEFORE THE WEIGHT OF THE BEAR ONCE MORE CAME AGAINST THE DOOR
COULD HE CHECK HIMSELF BEFORE REACHING THE BRINK
YE'D BETTER PUSH ON BEIN SO MUCH FRESHER'N ME AN GIT THE BOYS FROM THE CAMP TO COME BACK FOR ME BRANNIGAN LAUGHED DERISIVELY
GEE REMARKED THE MAN THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL HE EJECTED THE EMPTY SHELL AND SLIPPED IN A FRESH CARTRIDGE
THER AIN'T NO PROPERTY RIGHTS I TELL YE IN ANY WILD CRITTER O THESE HERE WOODS
A POUNCE AND THE GREAT CAT HAD HER PAW UPON IT AND CROUCHED SNARLING UP AT THE HAWK
THE STOCKING WAS JUST THE THING AND IN A MINUTE SHE HAD THE LATCH SECURE
IT WAS DARKLY OVERHUNG BY GREAT-LIMBED WATER-ASH AND MAPLE
AS FOR BROWN BULL ALL THIS WAS JUST WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED AND MADE PROVISION AGAINST
WITH THIS SHOT HE WAS TAKING NO CHANCES
THE LAST OF HIS STRENGTH HAD BARELY SUFFICED HIM TO GAIN THE SHORE AND THE REFUGE OF THIS PERCH UPON THE RIBS OF THE ANCIENT WRECK
BRANNIGAN SNATCHED HER DOOR OPEN AND SHE LUMBERED OUT WITH A RUSH KNOCKING HIM INTO THE SNOW AND WENT FLOUNDERING OFF TOWARD THE WOODS
THEY INSTINCTIVELY CROWDED AWAY FROM THE FLYING HORSEMEN THE FLAMES AND THUNDER OF THE GUNS

IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD LOAD HER RIBS WITH FAT TO LAST HER THROUGH HER LONG WINTER'S SLEEP IN SOME CAVE OR HOLLOW TREE
THE EAGLES IMAGINING THAT THE LOUD MONSTER HAD BEEN PUT TO FLIGHT BY THEIR THREATS CAME FOLLOWING IN ITS WAKE DETERMINED TO SEE IT SAFELY OFF THEIR PREMISES AND GIVE IT NO TIME TO RECOVER FROM WHAT THEY CONCEIVED TO BE ITS PANIC
BUT THE EARS OF AN OWL ARE A VERY MIRACLE OF SENSITIVENESS
WHEN SATISFIED THAT ALL WERE FAIRLY GOING SHE RETRIEVED HER STOCKING FROM THE BROKEN LATCH RECLOTHED HER NAKED FOOT AND SET HER BUNDLE SAFELY OUTSIDE
CLANCY PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND SPOKE LIGHTLY
THIS ERE'S MARY
THERE NOW SAID HE RETURNING TO THE CAVE AND ONCE MORE PICKING UP THE LITTLE ONE I'VE MADE YE AN ORPHANT TO BE SURE BUT I'M GOIN TO SOOTHE YER FEELIN'S ALL I KIN
PRESENTLY THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE LEAFY SCREEN HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A TRANQUILLY PASTURING EWE NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
THEIR BIG PADDED PAWS WENT LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW
ONCE IN A WHILE SOME BULL MORE FIERY THAN HIS FELLOWS WOULD CHARGE WITH BLIND UNCALCULATING VALOR UPON THESE NIMBLE ASSAILANTS ONLY TO BE AT ONCE SHOT DOWN FOR HIS HIDE
THE TREE CUT NEARLY THROUGH WAS JUST BEGINNING TO LEAN JUST TOTTERING TO ITS FALL WHEN ONCE MORE JOHN HATCH WAS CONSCIOUS OF THAT HATED CRAWLING IN THE SKIN OF HIS CHEEKS THE LIFTING OF THE HAIRS ON HIS NECK
THE GREAT BROWN RAM HIS EYES NEARLY STARTING FROM HIS HEAD CAME LEAPING MADLY UP THE NARROW INCLINE HIS FLOCK AT HIS HEELS BLIND WITH FRIGHT
BUT SHE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT HIS TONES AT LEAST WERE NOT HOSTILE
PUFFING HIS CIGAR BUTT IN HIGH GOOD HUMOR HE WENT OVER AND MADE FRIENDS WITH THE HORSE FEEDING IT WITH A FEW HANDFULS OF FRESH GRASS
THEY HAD EMPTIED ALL THEIR CATCH INTO ONE BASKET STOWED THE BASKET UNDER THE WAGON SEAT THEN STARTED OFF AGAIN TO FISH THE FINER REACHES OF THE STREAM WITH ITS WIDE POOLS AND LONG SUNLIT RAPIDS BELOW THE BRIDGE
A PAIR OF LONG BLACK SICKLE-CURVED TALONS SURMOUNTED BY THICKLY FEATHERED GRAY SHANKS CLUTCHED AT THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD STOOD
IT'S CLOSE SEASON ALL YEAR ROUND FER MARY AN SHE AIN'T FER SALE AT ANY PRICE THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY A SHUFFLE OF TIN PLATES ON THE TABLE
AS SHE WAS WORKING UP THE DETAILS OF THIS SCHEME--MORE FOR THE SAKE OF KEEPING HER TERROR IN CHECK THAN FOR ANY GREAT FAITH SHE HAD IN IT--THE THING SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING HAPPENED
THE RESULT WAS INSTANTANEOUS AS USUAL
YE WAS RIGHT LONG SAID HE
NOT MUCH HE SNORTED FEEBLY
AN I WAS WRONG O COURSE TO TREAT OUR VISITORS SO ROUGH AN TRY FORCE ANY KIND O A BARGAIN ON THEM
THE WORLD BELOW LOOKED LIKE A VAST SHALLOW BOWL THE SIDES CONCAVING UPWARDS AROUND HIM TO THE HORIZON
THEREUPON HE DECIDED THAT THIS PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS NO PLACE FOR HIS FLOCK
THE PANIC HORROR HAD ALL GONE
AND THEN WHEN THE STORM CLOUDS WERE DOWN CLOSE UPON THE LEVELS AND ALL THE WORLD WAS BLACK AND THE GREAT WINDS FROM THE POLE BITTERER THAN DEATH RAVED SOUTHWARD WITH THEIR SHEETED GHOSTS OF FINE DRIFT--THEN BLUE FOX WITH HIS FURRY MATE BESIDE HIM LAY BLINKING CONTENTEDLY IN THE DEEP OF HIS BURROW WITH FOOD AND TO SPARE CLOSE AT HAND
IT FELL TRUE AS HE HAD CHOPPED IT SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO SPRING OUT OF ITS PATH OR EVEN TO GLANCE AT IT
NO LONGER COULD SHE FEEL SECURE ON THE DIZZIEST AND REMOTEST LEDGES OF THE PEAKS NO LONGER WERE EVEN THE SOUNDLESS DEEPS OF SKY INACCESSIBLE TO MAN
HE WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF EXPLOSION WHEN HE SAW SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM CHECK HIMSELF WITH A CHOKED EXPLETIVE
AND HERE ABOUT SUNDOWN THE TWO COWS STOOD LOWING SOFTLY WAITING FOR HATCH TO COME WITH HIS TIN MILK PAILS AND EASE THEIR HEAVY UDDERS OF THE DAY'S BURDEN
THOUGH HATCH'S TRAIL WENT ON SHE SAW AT ONCE FROM HIS HALT AT THE EDGE THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED HERE
AND SOMETIMES TOO THE SLOW CIRCLING OF THE CURRENT IN THE POOL WOULD BRING IT CLOSE TO THAT STILL WATCHER ON THE ROOT BEFORE IT CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE FEEDING FISH
SUCH WAS THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LORD AND IN THEIR OWN POWERS OF FLIGHT THAT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM PARTICULARLY FRIGHTENED EXCEPT THE YOUNG EWE WHO HAD HAD SUCH A NARROW ESCAPE
THE GAUNT TIRELESSLY PATROLLING SHAPE OF HIS WHITE SENTINEL THE BRIEF MEAL DONE WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT LIGHTED HIS PIPE AND SMOKED STOLIDLY CROUCHING OVER THE SMALL FIRE
THEY HALTED NOSES IN AIR AND EARS PRICKED FORWARD ANXIOUSLY WONDERING AT THEIR LORD'S STRANGE ANTICS UNDER THE TREE
HE WAS READY FOR IT BUT HE WAS NOT HANKERING AFTER IT
KEEPING A SHARP WATCH ON THE LID OF THE BASKET THE FOX BACKED AWAY CAUTIOUSLY SEVERAL FEET LAY DOWN AND FELL TO DEVOURING THE TROUT
HAD THE BEAR BEEN A MASTODON OR A MEGATHERIUM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE SAME TO THE PANIC-STRICKEN RAM
BUT OF COURSE ALL WAS BLACKNESS THERE
HE FELT IT WAS GOOD OF BRANNIGAN NOT TO HAVE RESENTED THE SUGGESTION AS AN INSULT
WITHIN AN HOUR EVERY EAGLE OF BALD FACE KNEW OF THIS DREADFUL INVASION OF THEIR HITHERTO IMPREGNABLE DOMAIN
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT HALTED AND PEERED INTO THE THICKETS WITH EYES TRAINED AND PENETRATING BUT HE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING
IF THE LAND IN THIS REGION SKIRTING OLD BALD FACE WAS BARREN ITS WATERS WERE NOT
DRAGGING IT OUT FROM UNDER THE ASTONISHED JEFF HE SWUNG IT SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT HIS HEAD AND THEN LAUNCHED IT SPRAWLING AND SCREECHING HIGH THROUGH THE AIR
WE MADE IT UP ALL RIGHT THE TRAIL OF THE VANISHING HERDS ONCE AGAIN BUT SLUGGISHLY AS IF OPPRESSED BY APPREHENSIONS WHICH THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE HUMPED AND LION-FRONTED HERDS OF THE BISON BEGAN TO GATHER FOR THE IMMEMORIAL SOUTHWARD DRIFT
THE FOX WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE TROUT LYING SCATTERED ABOUT THE GRASS SOME OF THEM BITTEN AND MANGLED
WE RISE FROM ITS PAGES WITH THE BREATH OF THE OPEN SPACES IN OUR LUNGS."--_BOSTON TRANSCRIPT PUBLISHED BY THE MACMILLAN COMPANY 64-66 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK BY CHARLES G
HE PUT HIS PAW ON THE PRIZE AND GLARED ACROSS THE WATER WITH A DEFIANT GROWL
THE TEAL KNEW THAT HIS ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE FROM THIS LONG-WINGED PURSUER WAS TO REACH THE WATER PLUNGE BENEATH IT AND SWIM FOR SOME HIDING-PLACE UNDER THE FRINGING WEEDS
AS SOON AS HE PLUNGED INTO THE THICKETS HE LOST SIGHT OF THE WATCHER ON THE PEAK
THROUGH THE ROAR OF HIS MOTOR MACCREEDY CAUGHT THE STRIDENT SHRILLNESS OF THEIR CRIES
ONCE MORE THE BULL'S EYES BLAZED AND AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS ANTLERS IN DEFIANCE
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE TRAIL BEHIND HIM WHICH WAS CLEAR AND STRAIGHT TO HIS VIEW FOR A GOOD TWO HUNDRED YARDS BACK
AND HE HAD TACTICS TO ELUDE EVEN THE DREADFUL THUNDER AND SPURTED LIGHTNING OF THEIR GUNS
HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THEM
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE SHE DEVOTED HERSELF WITH CONCENTRATED FERVOR FOR SOME MINUTES TO THE TWO LIMP AND BEDRAGGLED LITTLE FORMS STRIVING PASSIONATELY TO STIR THEM BACK TO LIFE
AT ONE POINT THE GRASS-FRINGE CAME SO CLOSE TO THE WRECK THAT ITS SPEARS WERE THRUSTING IN BETWEEN THE RIBS
SHE FED THEM WITH A FEW MORE SCRAPS OF SPRUCE SCRAPED UP FROM ANOTHER BUNK TILL SHE SAW THAT THEY WOULD SURELY CATCH
THE VICTIM SIMPLY VANISHED WITHOUT ANY FUSS
FOR THE TIME HOWEVER NOTHING OF THE SORT TOOK PLACE AND THE TWO LITTLE SQUARES CONTINUED TO GLIMMER PALELY
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN AND THE DOORWAY QUITE CLEAR
MOREOVER WHENEVER THE WIND HOWLED IN THE NIGHT OR THE VOICE OF THE SOLITARY WOLF CAME QUAVERING DOWN LIKE THE WIND FROM THE GRANITE HEIGHTS THE BOY WOULD BE SEIZED WITH A RESTLESSNESS AND A CRAVING TO GO FORTH INTO THE DARKNESS
THEN THE GREAT MARCH BEGAN THE FATEFUL SOUTHWARD DRIFT
KILLING FOR MEAT AND NOT FOR SPORT THEY SELECTED ONLY YOUNG COWS IN GOOD CONDITION AND WERE TOO SPARING OF THEIR POWDER TO SHOOT MORE THAN THEY NEEDED
BUT HE DID NOT LOOK BACK
IT SPREAD UP THE HOT TURQUOISE-BLUE SKY WITH A TERRIFYING RAPIDITY BLOTTING OUT THE EMPTY PLAIN AS IT APPROACHED
THE AMAZED PANTHER LET OUT A SCREECH OF PROTEST WHICH ENDED IN A CONVULSIVE SNEEZE
AN IT SAVES ME A HEAP O BOTHER II DRIVEN BY HIS HUNGER AND REASSURED BY THE SMELL OF THE HANDFUL OF FUR WHICH THE WOODSMAN LEFT WITH HIM THE CUB PROMPTLY ACCEPTED HIS ADOPTION
AND SHE WAS NEARING--SHE COULD NOT NOW BE MORE THAN TWELVE MILES FROM--THE ACTUAL HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD THAT GRAY CABIN ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE REMOTE AND WIND-SWEPT SETTLEMENT OF STONY BROOK
HE HAD HAD RATHER POOR LUCK WITH THE WOOD-MICE AND HIS CHAPS WATERED WITH THE MEMORY OF THOSE TROUT IN THE WAGON

HE WAS FEELING VERY DROWSY
BUT THE EYES OF THE TIRELESS SENTINEL HE DID NOT MEET FOR THEY WERE KEPT ALWAYS TURNED AWAY FROM HIM
POOR OLD BEGGAR HE MUTTERED
I NOTICED YE COME AWAY IN A HURRY LONG HE REMARKED DRILY
HE WAS INDEFATIGABLE IN HIS EFFORTS TO WAG HIS TAIL
ON THE EVENING FOLLOWING HATCH'S TRIP UP OLD SUGAR LOAF HE WAS A LITTLE LATER THAN USUAL AT HIS MILKING AND THE PASTURE WAS ALL AFLOAT IN VIOLET DUSK AS HE DROPPED THE TWO UPPER BARS AT ONE END AND SWUNG HIS LONG LEGS OVER WITH A CLATTER OF HIS TWO TIN PAILS
THE GIRL RAN TO HIM
MOUNTING SWIFTLY THEY PASSED THE DESCENDING AEROPLANE ON EITHER SIDE AND THEN GATHERED IN ABOVE IT SWOOPING AND YELPING
FURIOUS AT HAVING MISSED HER STRIKE THE GREAT HORNED OWL THAT TIGRESS OF THE AIR FLAPPED UP AGAIN ON HER SOUNDLESS DOWNY WINGS AND SWOOPED SUDDENLY AT THE BASKET AS IF TRYING TO TURN IT OVER
BUT THIS TIME HE SPRANG A LITTLE TOO SLOWLY
WITH A SHAMEFACED AIR HE GLANCED ABOUT HIM
HE KNEW THAT ITS SAPPY WOOD WOULD BURN WITH DIFFICULTY BUT IT WOULD DO TO MAKE THE REST OF THE FUEL LAST LONGER--POSSIBLY WITH THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS CARE EVEN TILL SUNRISE
THEY DID NOT MINGLE WITH THE SUCKERS BUT POISED THEMSELVES SUPERCILIOUSLY A FOOT OR SO ABOVE THEM OR LURKED SINGLY UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE SCATTERED ROCKS ON THE BOTTOM
THERE WERE THE WOLVES NO LONGER IN HIDING BUT STALKING FORTH FROM THE THICKETS
THEY SAW THAT HE WAS DEPARTING SO THEY SANK AGAIN TO THEIR EYRIES AND CONGRATULATED THEMSELVES ON HAVING DRIVEN HIM AWAY
THE EYES OF THE LYNX FOLLOWED WITH SAVAGE INTENTNESS HIS SWIFT AND FISHLIKE DARTINGS BENEATH THE WATER
FOR A GOOD TEN MINUTES HE WAITED MOVELESS WITH THE PATIENCE OF THE WILD THINGS
THE DROWSING POOL-DWELLERS AWOKE AND SCATTERED IN A PANIC EVEN THE DULL SUCKERS DISPLAYING A MIRACULOUS AGILITY
THEY CAN CATCH THE SQUEAK OF A MOUSE AT A DISTANCE WHICH FOR ORDINARY EARS WOULD MAKE THE SHARP CLUCKING OF A CHIPMUNK INAUDIBLE
SHE FELT AS IF SHE WERE STRUGGLING IN A NIGHTMARE
DESPERATELY SHE THRUST A COUPLE OF FINGERS INTO THE SPACE ABOVE THE LATCH SO THAT IT WOULD NOT LIFT
THEN THE SINEWS OF THE WATCHER WOULD GROW RIGID HIS CLAWS PROTRUDE FROM THEIR SHEATHS A LITTLE GREEN FLAME FLICKER SPECTRALLY IN HIS EYES
BESIDE THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE RAPIDS STOOD A FISHERMAN CASTING FOR TROUT AMID THE WHIRLING FOAM-CLUSTERS
GETTING NO RESPONSE HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THE TAINT IN THE AIR WHICH WAS ALREADY MAKING HIS BACK BRISTLE
HE COULD SEE NO OBJECT IN IT
BUT HIS ATTEMPTS TO IMITATE IT RESULTED IN NOTHING MORE THAN AN OCCASIONAL GRUNTING WOOF
BUT HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH ON THE RESOLUTION THAT THE MOMENT HIS PARTNER SHOULD BECOME TOO WEAK FOR EFFECTIVE PROTEST MARY SHOULD COME PROMPTLY TO THE RESCUE
CALLED HOME SUDDENLY BY WORD THAT HER MOTHER WAS ILL SHE HAD COME BY TRAIN TO THE END OF THE BRANCH AND TRIED TO GET A RIG TO TAKE HER AROUND BY THE MAIN ROAD TO STONY BROOK
THE FIRE FADED FROM THE BULL'S EYES AND HE JUMPED ASIDE NERVOUSLY
BUT HE WAS OF DOGGED TEMPER AND HE SHOWED NO OUTWARD SIGN OF HIS IRRESOLUTION
IT SEEMED TO HIM TO SUGGEST A VERY MADNESS OF HATE AN OBSESSION WHICH MIGHT CULMINATE IN SOME DEED OF DESPERATION UNHEARD OF AMONG LYNXES
THEN WITH A RUSH OF EXULTATION HE RAN OVER TO EXAMINE THE MYSTERIOUS POOL
AT A DELIBERATE PACE QUITE UNLIKE HIS USUAL EAGER AND DARTING MOVEMENTS HE MADE OFF DOWN THE CLEARING TOWARD THE WATER
HE HAD SEEN CAMP FIRES BEFORE AND HE WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE TO DIE DOWN
THEN DISHEVELLED AND COWED SHE FLEW OFF TO ONE SIDE WITH NO MORE STOMACH LEFT FOR ANOTHER ASSAULT
ONE LESSON WOOF HAD WELL LEARNED FROM HIS FOSTER-MOTHER AND THAT WAS THE OBLIGATION RESTING UPON EVERY HONEST DOG TO PROTECT HIS MASTER'S PROPERTY
IT MIGHT KEEP HIM OCCUPIED
HER CALCULATION--AND SHE KNEW IT WAS A SOUND ONE--WAS THAT THE CABIN A SOLID STRUCTURE OF LOGS WOULD BURN VIGOROUSLY THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH AND TERRIFY THE BEAR TO FINAL FLIGHT
THIS WAS HER NATIVE WILDERNESS THIS WAS THE KIND OF CHILL ETHEREAL LONESOME SPRING WHICH THRILLED THROUGH THE MEMORIES OF HER CHILDHOOD
THER AIN'T GOIN TO BE NO KILLIN OF MARY ON MY ACCOUNT AN DON'T YE FORGIT IT
IN THE SAME MOMENT THE MINK SPRANG TO MEET THE ATTACK LENGTHENING OUT HIS ELASTIC BODY PRODIGIOUSLY AND REACHING FOR HIS ADVERSARY'S THROAT
HE DROPPED LIKE A LOG AND LAY QUITE STILL IN THE CHIP-STREWN SNOW
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT KNEW THAT THE PERIL HAD PASSED
BUT HE DID NOT MEET IT
PORE LITTLE EEJUT SAID BRANNIGAN MUCH MOVED BY THIS MARK OF CONFIDENCE YE SHALL HAVE SOME GRUEL QUICK AS I KIN MAKE IT WITH TWO FINGERS BETWEEN HER GREEDY LIPS AND A FIRM HAND ON THE BACK OF HER NECK HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN LEADING HER AROUND BEHIND THE CABIN WHERE HE TIED HER UP SECURELY OUT OF SIGHT OF THE WORK OF LONG JACKSON'S INDUSTRIOUS KNIFE
HE HAD NOT INTENDED SO ABRUPT AN ENTRANCE AND HE PAUSED PEERING WITH DIFFIDENCE AND HOPE INTO THE HOMELY GLOOM
LITTLE BY LITTLE ALSO BROWN BULL CONTINUED HIS CRAFTY ENCROACHMENTS TILL AT LENGTH AFTER PERHAPS A COUPLE OF HOURS OF MANEUVERING HE HAD HIS CHARGES SOME FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED YARDS IN FROM THE EXPOSED FLANK AND WELL PLACED NEAR THE FRONT OF THE MARCH WHERE THE PASTURAGE WAS STILL SWEET AND UNTRAMPLED
THAT'S THE WAY I'D FIX YOU TOO IF ONLY YOU'D COME DOWN HERE AND STAND UP TO ME AS FOR HIS CRUEL WOUNDS ON FLANK AND NECK HE SEEMED QUITE UNAWARE OF THEM
THE RAPIDS WERE FOAM-WHITE OR GOLDEN-RUDDY OR DEEP SHINING GREEN-BROWN UNDER THE SHARP AND PATCHY SUNLIGHT AND THEY WERE SOWN THICKLY WITH WET BLACK ROCKS HERE AND THERE GLINTING WITH PURPLE
THREE OF THE HUNTERS HAD TAKEN STATION EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE CENTER OF THE HOST
BUT HE TOOK HIS GUN ALONG WITH HIM WHICH HAD NOT BEEN HITHERTO BY ANY MEANS HIS INVARIABLE CUSTOM
BUT SOMETHING SEEMED TO TUG SUDDENLY AT HIS ARM--OR WAS IT AT HIS HEART
SMOOTH AS IT LOOKED HOWEVER HIS DAINTY AND DISCRIMINATING HOOFS WERE ABLE TO FIND SOME UNEVENNESSES UPON IT FOR HE TOOK IT IN TWO EFFORTLESS LEAPS AND LANDED AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS WITH A SHAKE OF HIS SPLENDID HORNS
IT WAS AN AFTERNOON IN THE FIRST OF THE SUMMER ONE OF THOSE LONG UNCLOUDED GLOWING WARM AFTERNOONS OF THE ARCTIC WHEN THE YOUNG SHOOTS OF HERB AND BUSH SEEM TO LENGTHEN VISIBLY UNDER THE EYE OF THE WATCHER AND THE FLOWER-BUDS OPEN IMPETUOUSLY AS IF IN HASTE FOR THE CARESSES OF THE EAGER MOTHS AND FLIES
THE BURROW OF BLUE FOX WAS DUG IN A PATCH OF DRY SANDY SOIL THAT FORMED A SORT OF ISLAND HALF A DOZEN ACRES BROAD IN THE VAST SURROUNDING SEA OF THE SWAMPY TUNDRA
AND AS THEY BEGAN TO FALL WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT BEGAN GLANCING FROM TIME TO TIME OVER HIS SHOULDER
HE WAS BUSILY HARDENING HIS HEART WITH FORCED FRIVOLITIES
THE BEAR NIGH GOT ME
AT LENGTH HE SET DOWN HIS WEAPON AND CAME BACK TO THE TABLE
FOR ALL THEIR SPITTING AND CLAWING HE PICKED THEM UP BY THE SCRUFFS OF THEIR NECKS STUFFED TWO OF THEM INTO HIS CAPACIOUS POCKETS CARRIED THE OTHER TWO IN HIS FIST AND MADE HIS WAY HASTILY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE OVER HIS SHOULDER LEST THE MOTHER-LYNX SHOULD HAPPEN BACK FROM HER HUNTING AND ATTEMPT A RESCUE
BY THE TIME THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE OFTEN BRILLIANT BUT ALWAYS TERRIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS ARCTIC NIGHT HAD SETTLED FIRMLY UPON THE BARRENS GAME HAD GROWN SO SCARCE AND SHY THAT EVEN SO SHREWD A HUNTER AS BLUE FOX MIGHT OFTEN RANGE A WHOLE DAY WITHOUT THE LUCK TO CAPTURE A PTARMIGAN OR A HARE
THE URGE THAT DROVE HIM FORWARD DIRECTED HIM TOWARD THE HALF-BARREN ROUNDED SHOULDERS OF OLD SUGAR LOAF WHERE THE BLUE-BERRIES AT THIS SEASON WERE RIPE AND BURSTING WITH JUICE
I'VE BRUNG ALONG ME BELT--IT WAS KIND OF TANGLED UP WI THE COAT--AN ME KNIFE'S IN IT ALL RIGHT HE FELT IN THE POCKETS OF HIS COAT
HE SHOOK IN EVERY NERVE TO THINK HOW NEARLY HE HAD REFUSED TO COME TO THAT UNHEARD CALL
EACH PAIR REGARDED ITS NEIGHBORS WITH A COLDLY TOLERANT AVERSION AND KEPT AN ALOOF BUT VIGILANT WATCH UPON THEM AS POSSIBLE POACHERS
THE STROKE CAUGHT THE BEAR GLANCINGLY ON THE SHOULDER LAYING IT OPEN TO THE BONE
NOW A MERE RAGGED BAG OF BONES SHE STOOD IN THE SNOW BEHIND THE RUINS HER EYES WILD WITH HUNGER AND DESPAIR
AND TRUSTING TO THEIR AMAZING SPEED THEY FREQUENTLY RAN FAR IN AMONG THE HERDS IN THE HOPE OF SPOTTING SOME SICK ANIMAL AND KEEPING IT IN VIEW TILL THE HOST SHOULD PASS ON AND LEAVE IT TO ITS FATE
TO THE MINK'S OWN EAR KEEN AS IT WAS HIS MOTION WAS AS SOUNDLESS AS A MOVING SHADOW
HE STALKED INDIGNANTLY BACK TO THE FENCE VAULTED IT FLUNG DOWN THE MILKING-STOOL GRABBED UP THE MILK PAILS SO ROUGHLY THAT THE CONTENTS SLOPPED OVER ON TO HIS HOMESPUN BREECHES AND SET OFF FOR HOME
THE OLD BRAVE WAS STARTING TO LIGHT A FIRE
FAR FORWARD AND TO THE RIGHT HE SAW WOODS AND RIDGY UPLANDS AND PURPLE-BLUE BEYOND THE UPLANDS A RANGE OF RAGGED HILLS
BUT HIS SECONDARY OBJECT WAS TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE DANGEROUS EDDIES AND WIND-HOLES THAT WERE LIKELY TO BE MET WITH ABOVE THE PROFOUND RAVINES OF BALD FACE AND ITS BUTTRESSING HILLS
BUT THE GREAT OWL'S ARMOR OF FEATHERS THOUGH IT LOOKED SO SOFT AND FLUFFY WAS IN FACT AMAZINGLY RESISTANT
HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THE DEJECTED JINNY THAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THE TRUANT BACK AGAIN BEFORE LONG
IT WAS A FRESH TRAIL TOO--SO ABSOLUTELY FRESH THAT SOME OF THE TRODDEN BLADES WERE STILL LIFTING THEIR HEADS SLOWLY FROM THE HOOF PRINTS
I'M THAT TIRED A BASKET OF FISH FRESH AND TENDER THE LIGHT OF THE MILD SPRING AFTERNOON CARESSED THE LITTLE ABANDONED CLEARING IN THE WILDERNESS
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE
HOW LONG HE WONDERED WOULD THE SENTINEL REMAIN TIRELESS
HE WANTED A DARKER AND MORE SECLUDED PLACE THAN THE RIBS OF THE WRECK FOR HIS SIESTA
BUT WHAT DID HE CARE FOR THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE SORREL HORSE
AND WHEN A TROUT WON'T FEED HE JUST WON'T AND THERE'S AN END OF IT
THEN SET IN THE LONG STEADY DRY COLD TONIC AND SPARKLING BUT SO INTENSE THAT THE GREAT TREES WOULD CRACK UNDER IT WITH REPORTS LIKE PISTOL SHOTS UPON THE DEATH-LIKE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
THEN ALL CLOSED THEIR DOORS TIGHT AGAINST THE DEATHLY COLD HUDDLED UP TO THEIR STOVES AND DREAMED GRUMBLINGLY OF SPRING
THAT'S WHERE MARY'S GOT THE BULGE ON US REMARKED BRANNIGAN
THEN THE COMBINED FLOW OF THE NORTH FORK AND THE OTTANOONSIS BROKE ONCE MORE INTO TURBULENCE AND ONCE MORE THE DESPERATE SWIMMER WAS FORCED TO THE SURFACE
THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS SHRINKING FROM THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE WOODS
PORK AND BEANS--OH ASSUREDLY
HELL HE GRUNTED GOOD-NATUREDLY
NOT EVEN WHEN A DESPERATE MOUSE CHASED BY A WEASEL SQUEAKED LOUDLY IN THE GRASS-ROOTS BEHIND HIM
HOW GLAD HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HEAR EVEN THE SQUEAL OF HIS ENEMY THE PIG OR TO FEEL THE IMPETUOUS BROOM OF MRS JABE HARASSING HIS HAUNCHES
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LYNX ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS HE WHO HAD ALL THE GRIEVANCE
AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO HER AN HOUR OF BREATHLESS WAITING SHE HEARD A SOUND AS OF SOMETHING RUBBING SOFTLY ALONG THE LOGS OF THE BACK WALL
HE PEERED DEEP INTO THE UNDERGROWTH FIRST ON ONE SIDE THEN ON THE OTHER
A LARGE HAIRY HAND STOLE FORTH REACHED DOWN AND CLUTCHED THE GUN
COMMENT WAS SUPERFLUOUS DISCUSSION UNNECESSARY
THEY SCOOPED AND BURROWED A DEEP PIT MADE MARY LIE DOWN AND SNUGGLED CLOSE AGAINST HER WARM FLANKS EMBRACING HER FIRMLY
FOR BEARS THIS WAS THE HUNGRY SEASON THE SEASON OF FEW ROOTS AND NO FRUITS FEW GRUBS AND LITTLE HONEY
HIS ASSAILANT UNABLE FOR A MOMENT TO FREE HIS CLAWS FROM THE TOUGH TWEED OF THE JACKET AND SWEPT BACKWARD BY THE RUSH OF THE PLANE PLUNGED DOWN AMONG THE SUPPORTING STAYS WHERE HE STRUGGLED AND FLAPPED WILDLY TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF
THE NEXT MOMENT HE LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH A FAT LEMMING DANGLING FROM EITHER SIDE OF HIS FINE JAWS
BUT AT THIS CLOSE RANGE SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT FEET ONLY IT TORE THROUGH ITS TARGET LIKE A HEAVY MUSHROOM BULLET AND WITH A STOPPING FORCE THAT HALTED THE ANIMAL'S CHARGE IN MID-AIR LIKE THE BLOW OF A STEAM HAMMER
INTERESTING AND INDEED UNPARALLELED AS THE INTERVENTION OF THE BROWN RAM HAD BEEN PETE ALLEN HAD NOT TAKEN TIME TO OBSERVE IT WITH THE MINUTE CARE WHICH SO NOVEL AN INCIDENT WAS ENTITLED TO
THE EXTENDED TALONS WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CLOTH TEARING A LONG GASH AND BEFORE THE BIRD COULD RECOVER HERSELF SHE WAS CAUGHT BY ONE OF THE STRONG WIRES THAT BRACED THE WING
HER STOUT SHOES AND HEAVY WOOLEN STOCKINGS WERE DRENCHED WITH THE ICY WATER BUT SHE WAS STRONG AND FULL OF ABOUNDING HEALTH AND SHE FELT NEITHER COLD NOR FATIGUE
SHE DARTED IN THROUGH THE DOORWAY--NOW BLAZING CHEERFULLY ALL UP ONE SIDE--AND DRAGGED FORTH THE HEAVY BENCH THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING DRY TO SIT ON WHILE SHE WATCHED THE APPROACHING CONFLAGRATION
SOON ALL THE EYES OF THE HOST WERE TURNED UPON IT
ALONG THE FOOT OF THE UPLANDS TO THE RIGHT HE MARKED A PATCH OF SWAMP SOWN WITH SEDGY POOLS AND CLUMPS OF DENSE BUSHES
THE OTTER SNIFFED INQUIRINGLY AT THE GROUND AS IF DISCOVERING A NEW SCENT THERE
IN FACT HE HAD NO IDEA THAT ANY SUCH CREATURE AS A BLUE HERON EXISTED
RECKON I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YE INTO THE WOODS NOW AN AG'IN KIND OF FUR DISCIPLINE AN HELP YE TO GIT IT BACK
HERE HE PROCEEDED TO SWALLOW HIS PRIZE HEAD FIRST
SHE BLEATED SEVERAL TIMES HOARSELY APPEALINGLY
BUT BRANNIGAN INTERVENED WITH PROMPT DECISION
HIS LUCK FAVORED HIM FOR HE HAPPENED TO SCRATCH ON THE LATCH
AND MCLAGGAN KNOWING WHAT THAT MEANT GLANCED AROUND DISCREETLY FOR THE EASIEST TREE TO CLIMB
AND AFTER ALL TO HIS MIND THEY WERE KITTENS OF A KIND AND THEREFORE ENTITLED TO A MORE GRACIOUS FORM OF TAKING OFF
THE EAGLE BEHIND HIM GOT FREE AND FLAPPED OFF MUCH DAUNTED BY THE ENCOUNTER
THEY WENT SULLENLY AS IF UNDER A CLOUD OF DARK EXPECTATION
TO HIS EYES THUS PREJUDICED THE FRESH YOUNG FORM OF SISSY BEMBRIDGE PICKING ITS WAY DOWN THE TRAIL LOOKED APPETIZING
HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT THE END OF POOR MARY'S SIMPLE AND BLAMELESS CAREER WAS VERY CLOSE AT HAND
HE SAW ALSO THAT HIS MEN WOULD BE AGAINST HIM
GIRL WAS SOMETHING HE HAD NEVER TRIED AND IT MIGHT BE EDIBLE
HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT OF VENTURING SOME LITTLE WAY INTO THE WOODS IN SEARCH OF FUEL
BUT BROWN BULL'S HERD WELL GUARDED AND DISCIPLINED GOT OVER WITHOUT LOSS
BY THE END OF AUTUMN SHE WAS AMAZINGLY LONG-LEGGED AND LANK AND AWKWARD WITH AN UNMATCHED TALENT FOR GETTING IN THE WAY AND KNOCKING THINGS OVER
HIS PROBLEM NOW WAS TO KEEP THE TRAIL IN SIGHT WHILE HIMSELF REMAINING UNDER COVER
THE OTHER WAS AN IMMENSE BULL WITH SPLENDID LEONINE FRONT AND WITH A WATCHFUL SUSPICIOUS LOOK IN HIS EYES WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE SULLEN STARE OF HIS FELLOWS
THEN FOR A SPACE OF SOME DAYS THE ATTACKS OF THE INDIANS CEASED AND THE WOLVES AND COYOTES CAME BACK TO DOG THE TRAIL OF THE DIMINISHED HOST
THE HUM SHRILLED TO A MONSTROUS AND RENDING SCREECH AND THE SPINNING COLUMN SWEPT ACROSS THE RIVER WIPING IT UP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CHANNEL AS IT PASSED
ITS VAST WHITE WINGS WERE SQUARE AT THE TIP AND OF THE SAME WIDTH FROM TIP TO BASE--AN INEXPLICABLE INNOVATION IN WINGS--AND HE NOTED WITH APPREHENSION THAT THEY FLEW WITHOUT ANY MOTION AT ALL
FOR THE MOMENT THE VAST EXPANSES OF THE BARREN WERE NOT LONELY
THEN THE GREAT FACE WITHDREW ITSELF
BUT THESE FEW DAYS OF PEACE WERE BUT PRELUDE TO HARSHER TRIAL
SHE AMIABLY FORGOT HIM AND WANDERED OFF BY HERSELF INTENT ON NOTHING SO MUCH AS SATISFYING HER APPETITE WHICH HAD INCREASED AMAZINGLY
WITH A FURIOUS FLAPPING OF WINGS HE LIFTED HIMSELF ALMOST CLEAR OF THE FLOOD AND BEAT ALONG THE TOSSED SURFACE DRAGGING TAIL AND FEET FOR PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS BEFORE HE COULD GET INTO FULL FLIGHT
THE HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE BASKET THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE SQUEEZED HIS HEAD THROUGH IT WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO LET HIM REACH THE FISH
IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE
NEXT HE INVESTIGATED THE FISHING-BASKET
BUT THE CALF BY HER SIDE KEPT GETTING IN THE WAY AND BRANNIGAN'S FINGER LINGERED ON THE TRIGGER AWAITING A CLEARER SHOT
THEN HE EXAMINED CRITICALLY THE WARM HEAP OF FUR AND TEETH
WITH SMOLDERING EYES AND NO EXPLANATIONS HE RESIGNED HIS PROFITABLE POST AND STARTED INLAND ON HIS SNOWSHOES WITH A TOBOGGAN LOAD OF PEMMICAN AND FLOUR
IT WAS QUITE EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE TIER OF BUNKS ALONG ONE WALL A ROUGH-HEWN LOG BENCH A BROKEN STOVE BEFORE THE RUDE CHIMNEY AND SEVERAL LENGTHS OF RUST-EATEN STOVE-PIPE SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR
A HEAVY BLACK-AND-YELLOW BUMBLE BEE WITH A LOUD INQUIRING BOOM SWUNG IN HEADLONG CIRCLES OVER THE WRECK MORE THAN ONCE ALMOST BRUSHING THE FEATHERS OF THE MOTIONLESS STRANGER
BRANNIGAN LOWERED HIS GUN A LOOK OF HUMOROUS SATISFACTION FLITTING OVER HIS CRAGGY FEATURES
THE NEXT INSTANT WITH A LITTLE TINGLING AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK--JUST WHERE ON A DOG OR A MOOSE THE HAIR STIFFENS AT SUCH MOMENTS--HE UNDERSTOOD
AND TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE WAS LESS TERRIFIED THAN BEFORE
ALONG ONE SIDE CAME THE DEEPLY RUTTED BACKWOODS ROAD SKIRTING THE CLEARING AND MAKING ITS PRECARIOUS WAY ACROSS THE STREAM BY A RUDE BRIDGE NOT LIGHTLY TO BE VENTURED AFTER DARK
ONCE DIVIDED AND PANIC-STRICKEN BY FINDING THEIR FOES AT THE HEART OF THEIR ARRAY THE HERDS WENT TO PIECES HOPELESSLY AND WERE EASILY DRIVEN OFF TOWARD ALL POINTS OF THE COMPASS
MUCH TOO PROVIDENT TO USE ONE OF THEIR TWO MATCHES WHICH MIGHT LATER ON MEAN LIFE OR DEATH TO THEM THEY CHEWED TOBACCO TILL THEIR EMPTINESS REVOLTED AT IT
THEY SMOKED AND THEY TALKED A LITTLE NOT OF THEIR CHANCES OF MAKING CONROY'S CAMP BUT OF BAKED PORK AND BEANS FRIED STEAK AND ONIONS AND ENORMOUS BOILED PUDDINGS SMOTHERED IN BUTTER AND BROWN SUGAR
THE NEXT MOMENT IT DROPPED FROM THE BRANCH AND FASTENED TEETH AND CLAWS IN THE BULL'S NECK
NOTHING HAPPENED
A MASTER OF SUPPLY UNLIKE HIS RESERVED AND SUPERCILIOUS RED COUSIN OF KINDLIER LATITUDES BLUE FOX WAS NO LOVER OF SOLITUDE
IT HAD INDEED BEEN SCALED MEN SAID SOME THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO AFTER DESPERATE EFFORT AND ALTOGETHER HAIR-RAISING ADVENTURE BY A GREATLY DARING TRAPPER WHO HAD BARELY SURVIVED TO TELL OF HIS EXPLOIT
ALONG THE LEFT OF THE FIELD THE DARK SPRUCE WOODS CAME DOWN CLOSE TO THE ZIGZAG SNAKE FENCE OF SPLIT RAILS WHICH BOUNDED HATCH'S CLEARING
NOW HOWEVER HE WAS ANGRY
THE MINK'S LONG TEETH REACHED THE FLESH AND DREW BLOOD BUT HE GAINED NO GRIP
GO WAY DURN YE OR YE'LL BE THE DEATH O ME YET GASPED MCLAGGAN
THE WOLVES SNARLED VENOMOUSLY FORSOOK THEIR PRIZE AND VANISHED
THE CONSPICUOUSNESS OF HIS PERCH AND THE INTENSITY OF THE SUNLIGHT WERE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM
ARGUING THAT THE FLOCK MUST SOONER OR LATER RETURN TO THEIR PASTURAGE HE PICKED HIS WAY ON A LONG DIAGONAL DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE TRAVERSED A SUCCESSION OF GRASS PATCHES WHICH SHOWED NEVER A TRACE OF HOOF PRINT AND AT LENGTH FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEWILDERING MAZE OF LOW ABRUPT RIDGES DENSE THICKETS AND NARROW STRIPS OF GREEN GLADE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BATTLE WAS NEARER AT HAND THAN HE HAD IMAGINED
WITH ONLY HEAD AND WINGS ABOVE THE MAD SMOTHER HE FLAPPED ONWARD FRANTICALLY BEATING DOWN THE FOAM ABOUT HIM
SUDDENLY AT THE HEART OF THE ROSY HAZE A GIGANTIC YELLOW-BLACK COLUMN TOOK SHAPE BROAD AT THE BASE AND SPREADING WIDE AT THE SUMMIT TILL IT LOST ITSELF IN A SWOOPING CANOPY OF BLACKISH CLOUD
THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP CROPPING HUNGRILY WITH THEIR SHORT EAGER BITES SOON EXHAUSTED THEIR HIGH PASTURAGE
THEN SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND FELT BETTER
HE STOOD THERE SNIFFING WITH WIDE WET NOSTRILS AND SEARCHING THE HORIZON FOR DANGER
WHEN THE THUDDING RHYTHM OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS DIED INTO SILENCE THE FOXES ALL CAME OUT AND SAT UNDER THE DANCING LIGHTS AND STARED AFTER THE TERRIBLE RECEDING SHAPES WITH A CALM AND SUPERCILIOUS SCORN
IT PLEADED FOR THEM NOT AT ALL FOR HE HAD HIS ESTABLISHED CUSTOM IN DEALING WITH SUPERFLUOUS KITTENS
THAT IT WOULD DAUNT HIM FOR A MOMENT SHE FELT SURE BUT SHE WAS EQUALLY SURE THAT ITS EFFICACY WOULD NOT LAST VERY LONG
THE LONGER THE OTTER STUDIED THAT GRAY PROWLING SHADOWY SHAPE WITH THE WIDE EYES THE POWERFUL HUNCHED HIND-QUARTERS THE LONG AND RIPPING CLAWS THE LESS CERTAIN HE FELT OF HIS ABILITY TO HANDLE IT THE MORE SURELY DID HIS FIGHTING LUST COOL DOWN
THEY WERE GREAT DESTROYERS OF THE YOUNG DEER THE GROUSE AND THE HARES AND SO INTERFERED WITH THE SUPPLY OF JOHN HATCH'S LARDER
THE ENFORCED RESTS BECAME MORE AND MORE FREQUENT
AS DAY BY DAY PASSED ON WITHOUT EVENT THE DIFFUSED ANXIETY OF THE HOST QUITE DIED AWAY
AND AT ONCE THE PLAYING CUBS WHISKED INTO THEIR BURROWS OR DREW CLOSE TO THEIR MOTHERS AND SAT UP TO STARE WITH BRIGHT SUSPICIOUS EYES AT THE STRONG-WINGED FLIER
FOR THE FRACTION OF A SECOND HE HALF FANCIED THAT A SHADOW FLITTED ACROSS THEM
AT THE STRANGE SOUND OF HIS LAUGHTER THE BULL RETURNED BENEATH THE BRANCH AND GAZED UP AT HIM NO LONGER AS IT SEEMED TO MCLAGGAN INSOLENTLY BUT REPROACHFULLY
A DOZEN FEET AWAY FROM IT AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD STOOD THE BEAR STARING IRRESOLUTELY
WITH A CRISP OATH HATCH BURST THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH WHICH FRINGED THE ROAD
AT ODD MOMENTS DURING THE PAST HALF-HOUR HE HAD EXPERIENCED A FLEETING SENSATION OF BEING FOLLOWED
SLEEK AND GLISTENING WITH HIS LOW-SET SUPPLE FORM HEAVY-JAWED AND ALMOST DOG-LIKE FACE INCONSPICUOUS EARS DARK EYES AND LONG POWERFUL TAIL HE PRESENTED THE SHARPEST POSSIBLE CONTRAST IN TYPE TO THE GREAT SHADOWY MOON-EYED CAT THOUGH IN ACTUAL WEIGHT AND BULK THE TWO WERE NOT GREATLY DISSIMILAR
THEREFORE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE CLUMSY PLATFORM OF DEAD STICKS WAS THE NEST OF A PAIR OF BLUE HERONS
WHAT FOOLS THESE MEN WERE AFTER ALL
THE COVER WAS DENSE THE SLOPE STEEP AND TORMENTEDLY BROKEN
FOR A TIME NOW HE DID KEEP OUT OF THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS TASKS IN THE LITTLE FARM
THEIR ANGER BEGAN TO DIE AWAY INTO A MERE NERVOUS DREAD AND AVERSION
IT WAS NOT HIS WONT TO PIT HIMSELF AGAINST THE MIGHTY TIMBER WOLF BECAUSE HE HAD NO MORBID TASTE FOR SUICIDE BUT THIS YOUNG EWE WAS A FAVORITE
MOVED FROM HIS ACCUSTOMED ARROGANT INDIFFERENCE THE EAGLE FLEW OVER TOWARD THE TOWN TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT THIS DISQUIETING PHENOMENON
A MILE OR MORE OFF TO THE WEST A HERD OF CARIBOU BROWSED THE YOUNG GREEN SHOOTS OF THE TUNDRA GROWTH MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWARD
YET MCLAGGAN KNEW HIS INTUITION HAD NOT FOOLED HIM
BUT HIS MITTENED HAND WENT OUT CONTINUOUSLY TO CARESS MARY'S EARS PLEADING PARDON FOR THE TREASON WHICH IT PLANNED
THEY HAD NO GREAT FEAR OF HIS ROARS HOWEVER HAVING NEVER KNOWN MUCH HURT TO COME OF THEM
THEN ONCE MORE DISAPPOINTED HE RETURNED TO THE PACK TO SEE WHAT FURTHER SATISFACTION HE COULD GET OUT OF IT
HE TURNED HIS HEAD FULL ROUND AND FIXED HIS GREEN IMPLACABLE STARE UPON THE INTRUDER
THE SNOW CAME DOWN AND DROVE AND DRIFTED TILL MARY'S PEN WAS BURIED SO DEEP THAT A TUNNEL HAD TO BE DUG TO HER DOORWAY
THE DOOR HAD ONCE MORE BEGUN TO CREAK AND GROAN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A HEAVY BODY SURGING AGAINST IT
HIS PERSPECTIVE STRAIGHTENED ITSELF OUT
HE DIVED INTO THE BURROW AND JAWS OF STEEL CLASHED AT HIS TAIL AS HE VANISHED
TIMES FEW STORIES ABOUT ANIMALS HAVE AS STRONG A POWER TO INTEREST AND ENTERTAIN OR CARRY AS DEEP A CONVICTION OF THEIR TRUTH AND REASONABLENESS AS THOSE BY CHARLES G
AND THE SOUND OF THEIR BELLOWINGS AND THEIR TRAMPLINGS ROSE IN A HEAVY THUNDER ABOVE THEIR MARCH TILL THE WIDE PLAIN SEEMED TO ROCK WITH IT
HE GAVE A SHRILL YELP OF WARNING ANSWERED AT ONCE FROM ALL OVER THE COLONY
WHEN WOOF'S ELATION HAD SOMEWHAT SUBSIDED HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE THE CARCASS OF THE DEAD HEIFER
HAVING RECOVERED SOMEWHAT FROM HIS NUMBING EXHAUSTION THE GRAY VISITOR BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE PANGS OF HIS FAMINE
FOR SOME WAY IN FROM THE ENTRANCE IT WAS OF A CLEAN BRIGHT SAND MORE OR LESS BROKEN WITH STONES
BEING VERY HUNGRY SHE SEIZED THEM IN HER MOUTH AND FELL TO SUCKING THEM AS HARD AS SHE COULD
FROM THE HEAVY SCRATCHY FUMBLINGS THE GIRL COULD PERCEIVE THAT HER ENEMY WAS TRYING TO REPEAT HIS FORMER MANEUVER
THEY MIGHT SKULK OR DART ABOUT LIKE LEAN SHADOWS AS NEAR THE HERD AS THE JEALOUS COWS WOULD PERMIT AND HE WOULD NEVER TROUBLE TO SHAKE THE POLISHED SCIMITARS OF HIS HORNS AT THEM
HE RIPPED IT WIDE OPEN WITH HIS ANTLERS THEN BLEW INTO IT SCORNFULLY SO THAT THE FLOUR PUFFED UP INTO HIS FACE
MUCH REFRESHED HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
IT WAS SUCH A POST OF VANTAGE AS BROWN BULL LOVED
STEPPING SOME PACES BACK FROM THE THRESHOLD SHE NERVOUSLY UNTIED HER BUNDLE AND GOT OUT A BOX OF MATCHES
HAVING NO MORE INCLINATION FOR SLEEP HE RESUMED HIS JOURNEY RESOLVING TO SNATCH AT THE MIDDAY HALT WHAT SLEEP HE SHOULD FIND HIMSELF NEEDING
BUT HIS EYES NEVER SWERVED FOR A SECOND FROM THE APPROACH OF THAT OMINOUS WINNOWING SHAPE
WOOF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE SAW RED
SOMETHING STIRRED IN HIS BLOOD AND WOULD NOT LET HIM BE STILL
HAVING GAINED WHAT HE CONSIDERED A SAFE HEIGHT AMONG THE ROCKS THE RAM HALTED HIS FOLLOWERS UPON A JUTTING BUTTRESS WHERE THEY STOOD HUDDLED ABOUT HIM AND STARED DOWN RESENTFULLY UPON THE GRASSY GLADES
THE MINK WAS PUZZLED
HE WOULD STARE WITH ENDLESS CRAVING AT THE MASSIVE SUCKERS WHICH LAY PLACIDLY MOUTHING THE MUD
IT LOOKED AS IF THOSE LITTLE KNOTS OF WAITING MEN AND PONIES MUST BE ANNIHILATED
DRAGGING IT OUT UPON THE FURTHER BANK HE FELL TO HIS MEAL WITH RELISH IN FULL VIEW OF HIS LATE ANTAGONIST
WITH PLENTY OF FOOD TO SUPPLY THE DRAIN THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUGHT ON ALMOST INDEFINITELY DEFYING FROST AND FATIGUE IN THE SOUNDNESS OF THEIR PHYSIQUE
A LITTLE BLACK-AND-WHITE WOODPECKER WHICH HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM RAN NIMBLY UP THE MAST OF A GIANT PINE
HE SEARCHED ASSIDUOUSLY FOR ANYTHING LIKE A HOSTILE TRAIL
BUT SOME ONE ELSE HAD BEEN THERE
THE SPOT WAS A SAFE ONE BEING SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE TIMBER AND BOUNDED ALONG ITS UPPER EDGE BY A BROKEN STEEP WHICH OFFERED NO OBSTACLE WHATEVER TO THESE LIGHT-FOOTED PEAK-RUNNERS BUT WAS ALL BUT IMPASSABLE EXCEPT AT A CRAWL TO THE MOST AGILE OF THEIR FOES
BUT TO JEFF EVERY COVERT OR THICKET WITHIN A RADIUS OF FIFTY YARDS WAS AN AMBUSH FOR LYNXES AND ONLY AT HIS MASTER'S HEELS DID HE FEEL SECURE FROM THEIR SWIFT AND EVISCERATING CLAWS
HE CHASED THEM OFF ANGRILY IF THEY VENTURED WITHIN THE RANGE OF HIS ATTENTION
AND OF EAGLES AT THAT MOMENT HE WAS THINKING NOT AT ALL
IT CAME HALF-WAY ACROSS THE MEADOW THEN STOPPED AND EYED FOR SOME TIME THE TETHERED HORSE AND THE DESERTED WAGON
THE TRAMP HAD NOT BEEN LONG GONE WHEN A NEW VISITOR ARRIVED
INTO THIS ICY OBLIVION HE DROPPED THE BABY LYNXES IN A BUNCH WITH A STONE TIED TO THEM AS HE WAS WONT TO DO WITH THE SUPERFLUOUS KITTENS AT HOME
THE BEAR BEING AN OLD ONE HE HAD NO USE FOR IT AS FOOD NOW THAT HE WAS ASSURED OF A SUPPLY OF CHOICE MOOSE-VENISON
PEERING WITH TRAINED EYES WISE IN ALL WOODCRAFT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF THE UNDERGROWTH HE WAITED ABSOLUTELY MOTIONLESS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
AT THIS MOMENT THE AEROPLANE BEGAN TO MOUNT SKYWARD
AS HE RECOVERED HIMSELF HE WARILY BOUNCED ASIDE LIGHTLY AS A LOOSED SPRING
THEN EITHER MOVED BY A REMEMBRANCE OF THE HARSH WINTER OF THE NORTH OR DRAWN BY THE PULL OF THE HOST UPON HIS GREGARIOUS HEART HE LOST THE IMPULSE
THE TRAIL RUNNING IN FROM THE SETTLEMENT TO MCLAGGAN'S CAMP AMONG THE FOOTHILLS WAS A MATTER OF SOME FIFTEEN MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY
IN THEIR DROWNING STRUGGLES THE STRING HAD COME UNDONE AND THE VICTIMS FREED FROM THE STONE HAD RISEN TO THE SURFACE
BUT ABSORBED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS HE HAD PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT
BUT--WELL HE HAD HIMSELF ALREADY EATEN ONE OF THE TROUT AND A GOOD PART OF ANOTHER
THEN LONG JACKSON SAID AN THAT'S A FACT MR CLANCY THE BOSS MADE A NOISE OF IMPATIENCE BETWEEN HIS TEETH
WHERE MARY'S CONCERNED SAID HE SPEAKING WITH SLOW PRECISION I GUESS ME AN MY PARDNER HERE'S ALL THE GAME-WARDENS THAT'S REQUIRED
DEAF TO ALL DISSUASIONS SHE HAD COUNTED ON MAKING STONY BROOK BEFORE NIGHTFALL
BUT BRANNIGAN WAS TOO BUSY JUST THEN FOR ANY FOOLING
A HALF HOUR LATER WHEN BRANNIGAN AND HIS PARTNER HAULING THE DRAG BEHIND THEM BRISKLY GOT BACK TO THE LAKE THEY FOUND THE CALF STANDING WITH DROOPED HEAD BESIDE THE BODY OF ITS MOTHER
HOWEVER DISQUIETING THE BROWN BULL'S APPREHENSIONS THEY WERE TOO VAGUE TO LET HIM KNOW WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED
HE LOOKED DOWN UPON HIS MAGNIFICENT ADVERSARY RAGING BELOW HIM AND FELT A GENEROUS IMPULSE TO GIVE HIM WARNING OF THE PERIL LURKING IN THE UNDERGROWTH
THIS PITIFUL SIGHT OF COURSE WAS NOTHING TO BROWN BULL
BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS SHE CONVINCED HERSELF NOT ONLY THAT IT WAS THE ONE THING TO BE DONE BUT ALSO THAT IT WAS PRACTICAL AND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY PROVE EFFECTIVE
THEN ALL TOGETHER THEY WHEELED ABOUT SHARPLY AS IF WORKED ON A SINGLE SPRING AND FLED OFF IN ENORMOUS BOUNDS OVER AND THROUGH THE THICKETS
THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF OWL AS HE KNEW WAS A MOST FORMIDABLE ANTAGONIST
HOT AND MELTING AS THE ARCTIC SUMMER MIGHT BE IT COULD NEVER REACH WITH ITS ARDENT FINGERS THE FOUNDATIONS OF ETERNAL FROST WHICH UNDERLAY ALL THAT LAND AT A DEPTH OF A VERY FEW FEET
FROM THE FIRST SHE TOOK BRANNIGAN IN LOCO PARENTIS AND EXCEPT WHEN TIED UP WAS EVER DUTIFULLY AT HIS HEELS
YET BROWN BULL WAS UNEASY
HE KNEW SOMETHING OF TRAPS
SUDDENLY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY JOHN HATCH STOPPED IN HIS STRIDE GRIPPED HIS AXE INSTINCTIVELY AND GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER
HE CHANGED HIS COURSE AND BEGAN TO STALK PETE ALLEN EVEN AS PETE ALLEN WAS STALKING THE SHEEP
HIS WINGS SPREAD AND HE ROSE AS IF LIFTED BY A BREATH FROM BENEATH
BUT THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST
HIS SATISFACTION AT HAVING SEEN THROUGH THEIR SCHEMES ALMOST COMPENSATED HIM FOR THE LOSS OF THE EXPECTED MEAL
IT WAS A LONG DIFFICULT CHOKING PROCESS FOR THE FISH WAS ONE OF THE STOUTEST HE HAD EVER ATTEMPTED
EVEN HER BELOVED MASTER FELL INTO A SECONDARY PLACE AND HIS HOUSEHOLD OF WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO HELD HERSELF THE GUARDIAN NOW SEEMED TO HER TO EXIST MERELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS BLACK PRODIGY WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF TO HAVE PRODUCED
AS HE CAME INTO VIEW ONCE MORE TO THE ANXIOUS WATCHERS IN THE AUTOMOBILE WHO HAD BEEN WORRIED OVER HIS LONG DISAPPEARANCE THE CAR TURNED AND RACED BACK OVER THE PLAIN TO X AMBITIOUS TO ARRIVE BEFORE HIM AND HERALD HIS TRIUMPH
THEY SPEEDILY DROPPED THIS UNPROFITABLE FORAGING PULLED THEIR BELTS TIGHTER AND PUSHED ON WITH THE CALM STOICISM OF THEIR BREED
HE WHISTLED GAILY OVER HIS CHOPPING WHILE THE OLD SORREL PASTURED COMFORTABLY IN A PATCH OF WILD MEADOW BY THE LAKE TROUBLED BY NOTHING BUT THE FLIES WHOSE ATTENTION KEPT HER LONG TAIL CEASELESSLY BUSY
THEN THE STRANGER SET HIMSELF VORACIOUSLY TO THE FIRST SQUARE MEAL WHICH HAD COME HIS WAY FOR DAYS
ALL HORSES SUBMISSIVE AND ENSLAVED HE HELD IN PROFOUNDEST SCORN
HE DIVED AND CAUGHT IT CAME TO THE SURFACE AND SWALLOWED IT
HE STUFFED SOME COLD MEAT AND HARD TACK INTO HIS POCKETS TOLD HIS INDIANS THEY NEED NOT EXPECT HIM BACK BEFORE NIGHT AND STARTED UP THE COURSE OF A SMALL STREAM WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE SHOULDER OF THE MOUNTAIN
YET AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WAS BY NO MEANS SO ALONE AS SHE IMAGINED
THERE WERE STILL A COUPLE OF TROUT UNTOUCHED
DIRECTLY BENEATH HIM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET DOWN THE MIGHTY SUMMIT OF OLD BALD FACE LOOKED INSIGNIFICANT
HIS FEAR WAS OF HE KNEW NOT WHAT AND THEREFORE IT GROUND REMORSELESSLY UPON HIS NERVES
BEFORE HE COULD DRAW A BEAD HOWEVER TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE SAW THE RAM BOUND INTO THE AIR AND VANISH FROM HIS NARROW FIELD OF VISION
AS WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT GREW TO MANHOOD THE WHITE WOLF GREW LESS AND LESS CONSPICUOUS IN HIS AFFAIRS TILL HE CAME TO BE LITTLE MORE THAN A TRADITION
AND THEIR KNEES FAILED THEM IN THEIR TERROR
BUT AS IT FELL IT CRASHED HEAVILY UPON A DEAD BRANCH IN A NEIGHBORING TREE
HE DROVE A WHOLE RABBLE OF WHIMSICAL FANCIES THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE LABORED RESOLUTELY ONWARD THROUGH THE SNOW
A BAR-WINGED MOOSE-FLY THAT VICIOUS BITER CHANCING TO ALIGHT AT THAT MOMENT ON THE CALF'S EAR SHE SHOOK HER LANK HEAD VEHEMENTLY
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS MASTER'S CARE THUS SUDDENLY THRUST UPON HIM HIS FEAR OF LYNXES VANISHED
SHE KNEW THE DOOR COULD NOT NOW BE UNLATCHED FROM THE OUTSIDE
FORWARD THE WAY WAS CLEAR
THERE WERE STILL SOME TROUT LEFT BUT HE WANTED TO GET AWAY
HERE THOUGH THE SIDE-PLANKING WAS ALL FALLEN AWAY SO THAT PRYING EYES COULD SEE THROUGH AND THROUGH THE RIBS IN EVERY DIRECTION THERE WAS YET A SORT OF SECLUSION WITH SOME SHADOW TO EASE HIS DAZZLED EYES
THE LEADERS FELL TO DIGGING AT THE BURROW WHILE OTHERS SCATTERED OFF TO TRY THE SAME EXPERIMENT AT THE OTHER BURROWS OF THE COLONY
MARY THRUST HER LONG-MUZZLED HEAD AROUND FROM BEHIND HER PARTNERS AND WAGGED HER EARS AND STARED
RECOVERING FROM HIS AMAZEMENT HE STRUCK OUT WITH HIS UNWOUNDED FOREPAW CAUGHT THE LAST UNHAPPY EWE AS SHE WENT OVER HIM AND HURLED HER CARCASS MANGLED AND QUIVERING FAR DOWN THE SLOPE
IT WAS ALL REQUIRED AND THAT URGENTLY BY THE AEROPLANE
THERE WAS A SOUND OF SCRATCHING A RATTLE OF IRON CLAWS WHICH TOLD HER THAT THE BEAST WAS REARING ITSELF UPRIGHT AGAINST THE DOOR
JOHN HATCH'S CHIEF OCCUPATION DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WAS THE CHOPPING AND HAULING OF CORD WOOD FOR THE SETTLEMENTS
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE CIRCLED SLOWLY JUST ABOVE THE NEST NOW APPROACHING NOW RETIRING WHILE HE PONDERED THE UNACCUSTOMED PROBLEM
THE WOODS WERE LIGHTED REDLY FOR HUNDREDS OF YARDS AROUND THE POOLS IN THE ROAD WERE LIKE POLISHED COPPER AND THE BEAR WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
THEN HE GREW ANGRY AND OBSTINATE
THE MINK DROPPED DOWN BESIDE IT FLUNG HIMSELF UPON IT FURIOUSLY AND BEGAN JERKING FORTH AND SCATTERING THE CONTENTS TEARING MOUTHFULS OUT OF ONE FISH AFTER ANOTHER IN A PAROXYSM OF GREED AS IF HE FEARED THEY WERE STILL ALIVE AND MIGHT GET AWAY FROM HIM
EACH OF THESE LITTLE GROUPS HUNG TOGETHER TENACIOUSLY UNDER THE DOMINANCE OF TWO OR THREE OLD BULLS AND KEPT AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE NARROW BUT APPRECIABLE FROM THE HERDS IMMEDIATELY NEIGHBORING IT
THEY SEEMED TO JUMP UP AT HIM AND HE DARE NOT LET HIS SWEEPING WING-TIPS TOUCH THEM LEST THEY SHOULD SEIZE AND DRAG HIM DOWN
THE BULLET WENT CLOSE OVER THE TOP OF WOOF'S HEAD AND SANG WASPISHLY ACROSS THE CLEARING
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE FELT THE LIGHT RESTRAINT OF THE ALMOST INVISIBLE LEADER UPON HIS WINGS WHERE THE OTHER TWO FLIES HAD AFFIXED THEMSELVES
AND SEEING THAT THE ONLY SOLITUDE HE KNEW WAS THE IMMEASURABLE DESOLATION OF THE ARCTIC BARRENS THIS WAS NOT STRANGE
AND THE PRESENCE OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN WARNED WAS VERY NEAR
WITH A SINKING HEART SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS EMPTY--THAT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A DESERTED LUMBER-CAMP
IN A CASUAL WAY MACCREEDY INFERRED THAT THEY MUST HAVE NESTS IN THE LEDGES OF THE PRECIPICES
HE WAS DETERMINED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM BOTH
ONE OR ANOTHER OF THEM WITH HIS GOLD AND SILVER AND VERMILION GLINTING UP THROUGH THE PELLUCID GLOOM WOULD BE FOREVER ON THE MOVE QUARTERING THE BOTTOM FOR CADDIS AND BEETLE AND NOW AND THEN SAILING UP TOWARD THE SURFACE TO INVESTIGATE SOME FLOATING ATOM THAT MAY CHANCE TO BE A FLY
FAR BE IT FROM HIM TO HELP HIMSELF WITHOUT LEAVE
BUT NEVER FOR AN INSTANT DID HE TAKE HIS EYES OFF THAT SLIGHTLY MOVING LID
YE MUST MAKE BELIEVE AS HOW I'M YER MAMMY TILL I KIN FIND YE A BETTER ONE PILLOWED IN THE CROOK OF HIS CAPTOR'S ARM AND WITH HIS NOSE SNUGGLED INTO A BUNCH OF HIS MOTHER'S FUR THE CUB CEASED TO WONDER AT A PROBLEM TOO HARD FOR HIM AND DOZED OFF INTO AN UNEASY SLEEP
YE KIN TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT
IT DIRECTLY OVERHUNG A TRANSPARENT AMBER-BROWN CHUTE OF UNBROKEN WATER IN THE MIDST OF THE LOUD TURMOIL OF NORTH FORK RAPIDS
HUSH MY DAUGHTER SHE SAID SOOTHINGLY
THE GRAY VISITOR WAS ALREADY HUNGRY AGAIN BY THIS TIME FOR AN OWL'S DIGESTION IS ASTONISHINGLY SWIFT
SCATTERED HERE AND THERE OVER THEIR NAKED LITTLE DOMAIN HE SAW THE FAMILIES OF HIS KINDRED SIMILARLY CARE-FREE AND CONTENT WITH LIFE
IT WAS EASY FOR HIM TO INFER HOWEVER WITH HIS INSTINCT AND HIS WOODCRAFT THAT THESE DISTURBANCES WERE DUE TO THE GREAT SOFTLY PADDED PAWS OF A LYNX
TWO OF THEIR NUMBER HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH AND WERE ALREADY FLAPPING BACK DEJECTEDLY TOWARD THEIR NESTS
AN INSPIRATION SEIZED THEM
THE TROUT WERE THERE IN THE BASKET SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FISHING HAD BEEN SO GOOD
HE SNATCHED UP HIS RIFLE A REPEATING WINCHESTER FROM THE TOBOGGAN AND WITH A GROAN RACED ONWARD IN THE TRAIL OF THE WOLVES
IT SCALED THE AIR SWIFTLY IN A STEEP SPIRAL
AND NOW THEY CAME INTO A GREEN AND FERTILE AND WELL-WATERED LAND WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTING TO LINGER AND RECOVER THEIR STRENGTH
THEN THE LYNX WAS GONE UP THE BANK AT A BOUND TO PIN DOWN AND FINISH OFF THE VICTIM
ON THE WAY OUT THERE OCCURRED NOTHING UNUSUAL
THERE WAS A CLATTER OF CHAINS AND HARNESS AS THE OLD SORREL SNIFFING THE ENEMY STARTED AT A GALLOP FOR HOME
IN SPITE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER HER ATTENTION WAS ABSORBED BY THE OLD FAMILIAR ATMOSPHERE OF THE WILDERNESS THE HAUNTING COLORS THE CHILL ELUSIVE POIGNANT SMELLS
IT WAS SAID--AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO TALK OF IT HE WAS NEVER KNOWN TO DENY IT--THAT THE OLD WHITE WOLF WHOSE HOWLING WAS LIKE THE WIND IN THE MOUNTAIN CLEFTS HAD BEEN SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN FOLLOWING THE BOY NOT OBTRUSIVELY BUT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE AND WITH AN AIR OF WATCHING OVER HIM
AT THE BACK OF THE CLEARING BENEATH A SOLITARY WHITE BIRCH TREE JUST BURSTING INTO GREEN STOOD A SQUATTER'S LOG CABIN LONG DESERTED ITS DOOR AND WINDOW GONE ITS ROOF OF POLES AND BARK HALF FALLEN IN
HE LIFTED HIS HEAD WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HIS BREAST
HE WHINED DEPRECATINGLY AND VENTURED ALL THE WAY INTO THE CABIN
BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST TROUT OF THE POOL THAT HE WANTED
ITS EYES SET NEAR TOGETHER WERE BRIGHT AND CRUEL
IT WAS MADE UP OF INNUMERABLE SMALL HERDS FROM A DOZEN TO THIRTY OR FORTY BISON IN EACH
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO RUSH UPON THE INTRUDER AT ONCE
ROBERTS."--_BOSTON TIMES THE MACMILLAN COMPANY PUBLISHERS 64-66 FIFTH AVENUE NEW YORK END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF HOOF AND CLAW BY CHARLES G
AT THIS SEASON THE TROUT--FINE VIVID FISH OF GOOD PAN SIZE--WERE LYING IN THE OPEN DANCING RUNS AND ABOUT THE TAILS OF THE RAPIDS
IT SEEMED TO OVERHANG THE COW FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND AND THEN FELL FORWARD AS IF TO CRUSH HER TO THE EARTH
MACCREEDY TOUCHED GROUND AT SOMEWHAT HIGHER SPEED THAN HE HAD CALCULATED UPON AND FOUND THE LEVEL STONE SWEPT BY THE STORM OF AGES SO SMOOTH THAT HIS WHEELS RAN ALONG IT MUCH TOO EASILY
ONCE MORE THE FINE HAIRS CREPT AND TINGLED UP AND DOWN THE BACK OF HIS NECK
BUT THE GREAT BEAST NOW IN THE HOUR OF HIS TRIUMPH AND HIS MOST ARROGANT FEROCITY HAD FAR OTHER INTENTION
THE REACTION FROM HER TERROR AND HER SENSE OF TRIUMPH MADE HER SO EXCITED THAT FATIGUE AND ANXIETY WERE ALL FORGOTTEN
BUT BRANNIGAN THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE AND LAUGHED
THEY WERE AS UNCHANGING AS THE GEMMED EYES OF AN IDOL
HERE AND THERE A LITTLE TROOP--PERHAPS HALF A DOZEN COWS UNDER THE LORDSHIP OF SOME SHAGGY BULL MORE ALERT AND SUPPLE-WITTED THAN HIS FELLOWS--RESISTED THE SUMMONS TO ASSEMBLE AND SLIPPED OFF AMONG THE WOODED GLADES
WHATEVER WOULD WE HAVE DONE WITHOUT MARY COMMENTED BRANNIGAN
NEITHER OF THESE APPEARING TO IMPRESS THE CREEPING FOE HE FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP STILL ANY LONGER
THIS TOUCHING GIFT OF ONE OF HIS OWN LARRIGANS OPENED HIS EYES AND HIS HEART
GUESS I'VE GOT THE CREEPS GROWLED HATCH WITH CERTAIN UNPRINTABLE EXPLETIVES WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE ANNOYANCE AND SURPRISE
THE TRAIL WAS NONE TOO FRESH SO HE KNEW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY RASH HASTE
STIRRING HIS FIRE TO A BRISKER BLAZE--AT WHICH FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THE WOLVES DREW BACK INTO THEIR COVERT--HE STRODE FORTH AND FELLED THE SPRUCE IN HALF A DOZEN SKILFUL STROKES
AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION HE WAS READY TO RETURN AND FIGHT THE MATTER OUT
SHE MOVED OVER BESIDE THE BROKEN STOVE AND STOOD MATCH IN HAND READY TO SET FIRE TO THE PILE OF DRY SPRUCE TIPS
JACKSON STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF OPENED HIS EYES WIDE SAW THE LIGHT AND THE SUDDEN INCREASE OF IT AS THE CAMP DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN HEARD ANSWERING SHOUTS AND COLLAPSED SPRAWLING ON MARY'S BACK
HE LAID DOWN THE PRIZE AND INSPECTED IT WITH SATISFACTION--A ROUND-BODIED CREATURE SOME SIX INCHES LONG OF A GRAY COLOR MOTTLED WITH RUSTY RED WITH A MERE APOLOGY FOR A TAIL AND WITH THE TOES OF ITS FOREPAWS EXAGGERATEDLY DEVELOPED FOR USE PERHAPS IN CONSTRUCTING ITS MOSSY TUNNELS
THE BEANS AND THE SUGAR WENT ALL ABROAD AT THE FIRST ATTACK THE BIG AND THE LITTLE TIN ROLLED AWAY AND THE BULL DEVOTED HIS ATTENTION FOR A MOMENT TO THE BAG OF FLOUR
HE CHOSE HIS PATH UNHESITATINGLY PICKING UP HIS LANDMARKS WITHOUT CONSCIOUS EFFORT AMONG HILL-TOPS AND VALLEYS AND RAVINES WHICH TO THE UNINITIATED EYE MUST HAVE ALL LOOKED ALIKE
ON BRANNIGAN'S GRUEL MARY MADE SHIFT TO SURVIVE AND EVEN TO GROW AND SOON SHE WAS ABLE TO DISCARD IT IN FAVOR OF HER NATURAL FORAGE OF LEAVES AND TWIGS
AS IT CHANCED HOWEVER THE VICTIM CAME DOWN WITH A THUD ALMOST BENEATH THE WHISKERED NOSE OF THE WILDCAT
IF THE FUGITIVE SHOULD PROVE TO HAVE ANY FIGHT LEFT IN HIM THEY TWO WOULD STAND BACK TO BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO PULL THE DESPERATE VENTURE THROUGH
FOR HE WAS HUNGRIER THAN USUAL AND HIS HUNGER WAS PARTICULARLY BENT ON FISH
BUT THE FOX DID NOT WANT HIM TO COME OUT
MRS SMITH AS LONG AS SHE WAS IN A GOOD HUMOR ALLOWED HIM THE FREEDOM OF THE HOUSE CODDLED HIM WITH KITCHEN TIT-BITS AND LAUGHED WHEN HIS AFFECTIONATE BUT AWKWARD BULK GOT IN THE WAY OF HER OUTBURSTS OF MOPPING OR HER PAROXYSMS OF SWEEPING
HE HAD GOT WHAT HE WANTED
THE SNOW HAD BEEN RECENTLY PAWED AWAY AND THE WOLVERINE QUICK TO TAKE THE HINT BEGAN INSTANTLY TO DIG
HAD THE FOX RETURNED THE MINK WOULD NOW HAVE FOUGHT
THE MARAUDER FROM THE UPPER AIR WAS WAITING TILL HIS QUARRY SHOULD REACH LESS TURBULENT WATERS
IT WAS SOME TEN OR A DOZEN YEARS SINCE THIS REGION HAD BEEN LUMBERED OVER AND BY THIS TIME THE YOUNG TIMBER WHICH HAD THEN BEEN LEFT AS BELOW THE LEGAL DIAMETER FOR CUTTING HAD GROWN TO THE FULL AND STATELY STATURE OF THE SPRUCE
BUT HE GAVE NO HEED TO IT
IN THE FACE OF REAL CATASTROPHE THE NEW BRUNSWICK BACKWOODSMAN DOES NOT RAVE AND TEAR HIS HAIR
AT THIS POINT WERE THE PASTURE BARS WHICH SERVED THE PURPOSE OF A GATE
THE STILL AIR QUIVERED GLASSY CLEAR
HE LOVED THE CONFIDING MARY QUITE ABSURDLY
ITS OCCUPANTS WATCHING MACCREEDY'S MOVEMENTS THROUGH THEIR FIELD-GLASSES AND NOTING THE GREAT BIRDS CROWDING BEHIND HIM THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THE EAGLES HAD PUT HIM TO FLIGHT AND FORCED HIM TO GIVE UP HIS VENTURE
THEN HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HIS SLEEVES AND THE BREAST OF HIS COAT ON THE WARM BODY
BUT SOON IMMUNITY BROUGHT CONFIDENCE HIS CONSCIENCE CEASED TO TROUBLE HIM AND THE COMFORT DERIVED FROM THE NEARNESS OF THE RED HEIFER WAS INCREASED EXCEEDINGLY
AT THE SAME INSTANT SHE WHEELED AND STRUCK OUT SAVAGELY WITH ONE RAZOR-EDGED FORE-HOOF
WE GOT ALL THE FRESH MEAT WE WANT OH IF YE'RE FEELING THAT WAY ABOUT THE ORPHANT TOM I AIN'T KICKIN NONE ANSWERED JACKSON SPITTING ACCURATE TOBACCO-JUICE UPON A SMALL WHITE BOULDER SOME TEN OR TWELVE FEET DISTANT
PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 1914 REPRINTED APRIL 1917
WHAT D'YE WANT FER HER AS SHE STANDS LONG JACKSON SET DOWN HIS TIN OF TEA WITH A BUMP AND LOOKED AT THE SPEAKER CURIOUSLY
THE FOX HAVING SWALLOWED AS MUCH AS HE COULD HOLD STOOD UP STRETCHED HIMSELF AND LICKED HIS CHAPS
FROM THE WET POOLS BEGAN THE COLD AND MELANCHOLY FLUTING OF THE FROGS THE VOICE OF SOLITUDE AND UNDER THE PLANGENCY OF IT SHE FOUND THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS
AS THE TRAIL DIPPED TO THE SHORE HE CAUGHT A SOUND OF SPLASHING AND STOPPED ABRUPTLY MOTIONLESS AS A STUMP TO LISTEN
THE MAN SWUNG UP THE HILL NOISILY GRUNTING NOW AND AGAIN AS HIS FOOTHOLD SLIPPED ON THE SLUSHY MOSS-COVERED STONES
ALL THE CUBS BY THIS TIME GROWN NEARLY TO FULL STATURE IF NOT TO FULL WISDOM HAD MIGRATED
BUT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF A PECULIAR PICTURE BEGAN TO BURN ITSELF INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
ONCE ACROSS THE BLEAK RIDGE WHICH OVERLOOKED THE SETTLEMENT WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE UNTAMED UNTOUCHED LABRADOR WILDERNESS--EVERYWHERE A CONFUSION OF LOW HILLS BOWL-LIKE VALLEYS AND SPRUCE FORESTS UP-THRUSTING THEIR DARK POINTED TOPS ABOVE THE ENORMOUS OVERLAY OF THE SNOW
THE INDIANS SWEEPING UP ON THEIR MAD PONIES RODE CLOSE TO THE FLANK OF THE HOST AND CHOSE THEIR VICTIMS AT LEISURE
AS IF DAUNTED BY THE TERRIFIC BUFFET HE DREW BACK UPON HIS HAUNCHES SEEMING TO SHRINK TO HALF HIS SIZE
IT CONSISTED OF A DOZEN COWS WITH THEIR CALVES AND YEARLINGS AND TWO ADULT BULLS ONE OF WHICH THE YOUNGER AND LESS HEAVILY MANED KEPT DIFFIDENTLY AT THE REAR AND SEEMED TO OCCUPY THE BUSY BUT SUBORDINATE POST OF A SORT OF STAFF-SERGEANT
WE AIN'T WANTIN FRESH MEAT SO BAD AS ALL THAT MR CLANCY HE SUGGESTED WITH A GRIN
THE AIRMAN AT THE TOWN OF X WAS ONE ROB MACCREEDY WHO HAD RECENTLY BEEN MAKING A NAME FOR HIMSELF AT THE AVIATION GROUNDS SOME HUNDRED MILES DOWN THE COAST
HE DREW BACK SAT DOWN ON HIS TAIL AND EYED THE WAGON MINUTELY FOR A WHILE
BUT HE SPARED BREATH FOR A SHARP YELP OF WARNING WHICH CARRIED FAR IN THE STILLNESS AND SIGNALED TO HIS FELLOWS THE PERIL THAT APPROACHED
TO MACCREEDY'S EAGER AND BOYISH IMAGINATION THIS LOFTY PLATEAU AND THIS MYSTERIOUS UNINVESTIGATED LAKE WERE IRRESISTIBLE
IN THE NEXT HALF OF THAT FATAL SECOND THE LYNX WOULD BE UPON HIM WITH AN EXULTANT POUNCE HOLDING DOWN HIS SLIPPERY STRUGGLES WITH BOTH FOREPAWS AND BITING THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS MASSIVE NECK
IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE LIP OF THE LEDGE THE HAWK LIFTED HIS WINGS HIGH OVER HIS BACK AND STRUCK DOWNWARD SO THAT HIS TALONS WENT DEEP INTO THE WATER
AS THE WINTER ADVANCED AND THE COLD BIT FIERCER AND THE SNOW GATHERED AS IF TO BURY THE WILDERNESS WORLD AWAY FROM SIGHT FOREVER IT CAME AT LAST TO SEEM AS IF THE UNKNOWN PURPOSE OF THE AVENGERS WAS FORGOTTEN
MOREOVER HE WAS NOT IN THE SITUATION OR THE SURROUNDINGS WHICH ONE IS WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH DUCKS
THEN IN THE STILL WATER UNLESS HE SHOULD CHANCE UPON A HIDING-PLACE THE DRAKE WOULD SOON BE FORCED TO COME TO THE TOP FOR BREATH AND THOSE THROTTLING TALONS WOULD INSTANTLY CLOSE UPON HIS NECK
BUT HE HAD LAID HIS COURSE AND HE PUSHED ON CONFIDENTLY WORKING AROUND THE MOUNTAIN SO THAT HE MIGHT COME UPON THE QUARRY WITH THE SUN AT HIS BACK
HOW FUR WOULD YE SAY INSISTED JACKSON WHO REALLY KNEW QUITE AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS HIS PARTNER
THEN SHE WOULD BAWL FRANTICALLY IN HER TERROR
MCLAGGAN WITH ACHING RIBS CLIMBED DOWN FROM HIS REFUGE AND STOOD SURVEYING THE WRECKAGE OF HIS SUPPLIES
HIS RAGE PASSED FROM HIM
BRANNIGAN WOULD TUMBLE FROM HIS BUNK AND RUSH OUT TO THE RESCUE
WHAT THEN WAS IN THE BASKET
MEANWHILE THERE BEHIND THE BASKET LID THE MINK WAS RAGING IRRESOLUTELY
SO BLUE FOX DUG HIS BURROW NOT TOO DEEP BUT RATHER ON A GENTLE SLANT AND FORMED HIS CHAMBER AT A DEPTH OF NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWO FEET BELOW THE ROOTS OF THE BUSHES
AND THERE THEY HALTED SOME CROUCHING SOME SITTING SOME MOVING RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AND ALL EYEING THEIR INEXORABLE CHIEF EXPECTANTLY AS IF LOOKING FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW HIS INHIBITION AT ANY MOMENT AND LET THEM AT THEIR PREY
AS FOR THE MOTHER-LYNX SHE HAD PASSED OUT OF HIS MIND SO INGRAINED AND DEEP WAS HIS SCORN OF ALL SUCH VARMIN BUT PRESENTLY THE INSISTENCE OF THAT UNSEEN PRESENCE ON HIS TRAIL BECAME TOO STRONG FOR HIM AND WITH A CURSE HE TURNED HIS HEAD
BENEATH THE BANK WAS AN OLD MUSQUASH HOLE WHICH HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH
AND THE WILD COUNTRY BELOW WAS DIVIDED AMONG THEM INTO SIX RANGES EACH GREAT BIRD HAVING HIS OR HER OWN HUNTING GROUND UPON WHICH NOT EVEN THEIR OWN MATES COULD POACH WITH IMPUNITY
PUZZLED HE LOWERED THE RIFLE FROM HIS SHOULDER
BUT WISDOM CAME TO HIM JUST IN TIME AND HE DID NOT STRIKE HOME
THE MOMENT HE HAD SHAKEN HIMSELF CLEAR THE BULL UNDAUNTED WHIRLED AND STRUCK LIKE LIGHTNING WITH HIS FORMIDABLE FORE-HOOFS
THEN HE THREW UP HIS HEAD SHARPLY EXPECTING TO TOSS THE WRECK INTO THE AIR
JUST AS THE MINK WAS GATHERING HIS LITHE MUSCLES FOR A SPRING A PAIR OF IMMENSE PALELY BLAZING DISCS OPENED BEFORE HIS FACE WITH A LIGHT SO SUDDEN SO BRIGHT AND SO HARD THAT HE RECOILED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
UP ON THE HIGH LEDGE BELOW THE PEAK THE SPRING GRASS WAS SWEET BUT THERE WAS LITTLE OF IT
THEN HIS NARROWED SEARCHING GAZE RETURNED TO THE WAGON AND TO THE FAT BASKET IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON
HE HELD HIS FOLLOWERS TO THEIR PLACE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE MARCH AND MAINTAINED HIS FIRM AND APPREHENSIVE VIGILANCE UNTIRINGLY
IT WAS ENOUGH HOWEVER AND THE UNHAPPY TEAL WAS HURLED EARTHWARD FLAPPING THROUGH THE TIPS OF THE BRANCHES
HE BEGAN TO THINK OF HIS OTHER PRIZES IN THE POOL TO BE GATHERED WITHOUT AN EFFORT
IN THAT PURE AND TONIC AIR BUT LITTLE SLEEP WAS NEEDED
THE DRAKE SANK AGAIN INSTANTLY
WHEN THE FIRE DIED DOWN MARY CAME FLOUNDERING IN AND LAY DOWN BESIDE THEM SO THEY DID NOT FEEL THE GROWING COLD AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD
WITH ONE SHORT SHRILL CRY OF ANGER HE SWERVED OFF AND SAILED UPWARD OVER THE RIVER
AND BLUE FOX WOULD HAVE HAD SMALL FORTUNE INDEED IN THE CHASE HAD HE HIMSELF REMAINED IN SUMMER LIVERY
HE ALLOWED HIMSELF ALL TOO BRIEF A RUN AND THE PLANE GOT INTO THE AIR BUT A FEW FEET BEFORE REACHING THE BRINK
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE IN THE WOODS PRYING ON HIS STEPS AND FRIGHTENING HIS CRITTERS HE WANTED TO COME TO GRIPS WITH IT AT ONCE
THEY HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HIS FRANK TERROR OF THEM
JUST AT ITS EDGE TOWERED A GROUP OF THREE IMMENSE WATER-POPLARS WHOSE TOPS HE DECIDED WOULD SERVE HIM AS A POST OF OUTLOOK FOR HIS NIGHT HUNTING
BEFORE THE RUINED CABIN STOOD A LIGHT WAGON ITS WHEELS AND POLISHED BODY BESPATTERED WITH MUD
AN THAT'S ALL I HEV GOT THEY FILLED THEIR PIPES THOUGHTFULLY AND LIT THEM FRUGALLY WITH A BLAZING SPLINTER FROM THE WOOD PILE
MIKE FARRELL WOULD BE ON THE DRIVE AND IF SHE SHOULD CHANCE TO PASS THE TIME O DAY WITH HIM AND LET HIM KNOW SHE WAS AT HOME--WHY THERE'D BE NO HARM DONE TO ANYBODY
TO THE PAIR OF GREAT FISH-HAWKS WHOSE HUGE UNTIDY NEST LIKE A CART-LOAD OF STICKS AND RUBBISH FILLED THE TOP OF A TALL DEAD PINE-TREE HALF A MILE ABOVE THE FALLS THE POOL WAS A CEASELESS AGGRAVATION
THE REALIZATION DAUNTED HIM
HE'LL NEVER MAKE THE MICHIKAMAW WITH THAT THERE LOAD MUTTERED ONE
THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE BEAR STILL SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES A LITTLE WAY UP THE ROAD AND SHE LAUGHED AT HIM
HE FLEW NOISELESSLY TO THE VERY TOP OF THE TREE AND PERCHED THERE SOME TEN OR A DOZEN FEET ABOVE THE DUSKY PLATFORM OF STICKS
FROM LEDGE TO LEDGE HE DROPPED OVER HAIR-RAISING DEEPS OF TRANSPARENT AIR WITH A PRECISION AND EASE THAT MADE IT SEEM AS IF HIS STURDY FRAME WAS AS IMPONDERABLE AS THE AIR ITSELF
BUT UNDERESTIMATING THE STRENGTH OF THESE WILD KITTENS HE HAD TIED THE STRING CARELESSLY
SO IT CAME ABOUT QUITE NATURALLY THAT HE SAW ALLEN FIRST
I WAS ONLY THINKIN WE'D SAVE THE YOUNGSTER A HEAP OF TROUBLE IF WE'D JEST HELP HER GO THE WAY OF HER MA RIGHT NOW YOU AX HER FER HER OPINION ON THAT P'INT GRUNTED BRANNIGAN TUGGING THE CARCASS OF THE MOOSE ON TO THE DRAG
BUT THE BEAR WITH THAT TINY BLACK FORM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEN FILLING HER WHOLE HORIZON COULD NOT CONCEIVE THAT THE MAN'S APPROACH HAD ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO ROB HER OF HER TREASURE
HE DUCKED--THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE HIS FACE
HE SLIPPED HIS MITTENS INTO HIS POCKET THAT HIS STROKE MIGHT BE SURE SWIFT AND PAINLESS BUT HIS FINGERS SHOOK A LITTLE WITH STRONG DISTASTE
AND ONE MORNING WHEN JABE SMITH CAME OUT IN THE FIRST PINK AND AMBER OF DAYBREAK TO FODDER THE HORSES HE FOUND THAT WOOF HAD DISAPPEARED
JUST AS HE WAS PASSING HE SAW THAT FINAL RUSH OF THE WOLF
THE TROUT AS A RULE HAD NONE OF THE REPOSEFULNESS OF THE SUCKERS
ONE HUNTER WHOSE PONY HAD STEPPED INTO A BADGER-HOLE AND FALLEN WITH HIM WAS GORED AND TRAMPLED BY A WOUNDED BULL
BUT HE COULD NOT GET RID OF THAT SENSATION OF BEING FOLLOWED
AND THE FISH WERE OF JUST TWO KINDS THE TROUT AND THE SUCKERS
BRANNIGAN GLANCING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER FROM TIME TO TIME CONCLUDED THAT THE CALF WAS HUNGRY
BLUE FOX SAT UP NOT FAR FROM THE ENTRANCE TO HIS TUNNEL BLINKING LAZILY IN THE GLOW AND WATCHING THE PLAY OF HIS FUZZY CUBS AND THEIR SLIM YOUNG BLUE-GRAY MOTHER IN AND OUT THEIR DOORWAY
DISCREETLY THEREFORE HE KEPT HIMSELF WELL WITHIN THE BASKET WHICH WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD HIM COMFORTABLY
BACK IN NEW BRUNSWICK PETE ALLEN HAD HAD THE NAME OF BEING A COOL HAND IN A CORNER
IF IT SHOULD BY ANY CHANCE DIE DOWN BEFORE FULL DAYLIGHT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD A CIRCLE OF SMALL FIRES WITH THE BURNING REMNANTS
THE PURSUER ALSO SHOT DOWNWARD AND STRUCK
A SWIFT MOTOR-CAR WHICH HAD FOLLOWED MACCREEDY'S FLIGHT AT TOP SPEED ACROSS THE PLAIN HAD HALTED AT THE POINT WHERE THE HIGHWAY PASSED NEAREST TO THE BROKEN AND IMPASSABLE REGION SURROUNDING THE MOUNTAIN
THE HEAVY GOING THE ABOMINABLE STATE OF THE ROAD HAD UTTERLY UPSET HER CALCULATIONS
ON AN ISLET IN THE MIDDLE OF A REEDY MERE SOME HALF-MILE TO THE EAST A PAIR OF GREAT WHITE TRUMPETER SWANS HAD THEIR NEST SCORNFUL OF CONCEALMENT
AND THOUGH THE CHASE OF THESE LONG-LEGGED AND NIMBLE LEAPERS WAS NO FACILE AFFAIR IT WAS BY NO MEANS TOO ARDUOUS FOR THE TASTES OF AN ENTERPRISING AND ACTIVE FORAGER LIKE BLUE FOX
FROM TIME TO TIME THE FLOCK STRAGGLED
THOSE BRUTE PAWS WOULD SMASH HIM BEFORE HE COULD REACH HIS RIFLE
IN A SORT OF FRENZY AT THE SACRILEGE OF WHICH IN HIS OWN EYES HE HAD JUST BEEN GUILTY WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT FIRED SHOT AFTER SHOT DROPPING A WOLF TO EVERY BULLET
CURIOSITY DOMINATING HIS HUNGER HE STEPPED UP TO THE BASKET AND SNIFFED AT THE HOLE IN THE LID
BUT BROWN BULL'S APPREHENSIONS REDOUBLED AND HE GREW LEAN WITH WATCHING
BUT JUST AT THIS POINT THE PEPPER IN THE BULL'S MANE BEGAN TO TAKE IRRESISTIBLE EFFECT BOTH IN EYES AND NOSTRILS
THREE LUMBERMEN CAME RIDING INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT AND DREW REIN BEFORE HER IN ASTONISHMENT
AND KNOWING THAT THE DISTANCE TO HIS BURROW WAS NOT LONG HE FELT THAT HE HAD A CHANCE
PRESENTLY THERE CAME A LOUD SNIFFING AT THIS CRACK AND THEN THE DOOR CREAKED AS IF A HEAVY BODY WERE LEANING AGAINST IT
CLANCY PAUSED
MCLAGGAN STILL FURTHER HASTENED HIS PACE
AS BETWEEN THE ELK AND THE PANTHER HIS SYMPATHIES WERE ALL WITH THE ELK IN SPITE OF THAT MISGUIDED BEAST'S EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT HOSTILITY
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES THE CABIN WAS FULL OF SPARKS AND SMOKY LIGHT
THE OLD BIRD THINKS HE CAN FLY SOME MUSED MACCREEDY BUT I BET I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM THE SURPRISE OF HIS LIFE A FEW MOMENTS MORE AND HE WAS HIMSELF SURPRISED AS THE SOLITARY SENTINEL WAS JOINED BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER TILL PRESENTLY THERE WERE SIX OF THE GREAT BIRDS FLAPPING AND WHIRLING BETWEEN HIM AND BALD FACE ABOUT AT THE LEVEL OF THE EDGE OF THE PLATEAU
WHO'D EVER A THOUGHT ANY BULL ELK COULD LICK A PAINTER THAT QUICK SCORNING TO BE CONCILIATED BY COMPLIMENT THE BULL TURNED AWAY TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY FURTHER DAMAGE HE COULD INFLICT ON MCLAGGAN'S BELONGINGS
BUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE WAS BALKED OR DELAYED BY OTHER MADDENED FUGITIVES GETTING IN HIS WAY OR TEMPTING HIM TO DELAY FOR A SLASHING BITE
THERE WAS BITTER FAMINE IN THE LODGES BUT THAT WAS PLAINLY NOT WHAT AILED THE LITTLE ONE
HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO TURN AND RUN
ABUNDANTLY LINED WITH FINE DRY GRASSES WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN IT WAS ALWAYS WARM AND DRY AND SWEET
THE DRAKE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF MEN THOUGH HE DID NOT GREATLY FEAR THEM AS HE AND HIS RANK-FLESHED TRIBE WERE NOT INTERESTING TO THE HUNTERS
BUT AT THE BACK OF HIS BRAIN WAS THE COOL CONVICTION THAT THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN HE WAS GOING TO PASS IN HIS CHECKS
COUNTLESS AS WAS THEIR ARRAY HOWEVER THEY SEEMED DIMLY CONSCIOUS WITH A SORT OF VAGUE COMMUNAL UNINDIVIDUAL SORT OF PERCEPTION THAT THEIR NUMBERS AND THEIR POWER WERE AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE MIGRATIONS OF PRECEDING AUTUMNS
HIS LEAN FLANKS WERE FAIRLY CLINGING TOGETHER FROM EMPTINESS
HE MADE THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT EFFORTS TO REACH MCLAGGAN'S REFUGE WITH HORN OR HOOF
BUT HE KNEW THAT A MOTHER OF ALMOST ANY BREED MAY DO DESPERATE THINGS FOR HER YOUNG
AFTER ALL AS SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT BEAR COULD NOT POSSIBLY SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE WINDOW SO WHY SHOULD HE NOT AMUSE HIMSELF BY LOOKING IN AT HER IF HE WANTED TO
BUT THE FATE OF THEIR GREAT LEADER SEEMED TO HAVE ABASHED THE WHOLE PACK
THE CUB WAS BUT TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OLD AND ENGROSSED EVERY EMOTION OF HER SAVAGE HEART
BRANNIGAN HAD NO STOMACH FOR A STEAK AT SUCH PRICE
IT HAD BEEN DISCREETLY REMOVED
AT THAT MOMENT WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT RECOGNIZED THE OLD BRAVE'S FACE
IN A LULL IN THE TALK HE SAID SUDDENLY TO THE VISITORS WE'RE ABOUT SICK O SALT PORK IN THIS CAMP MATES AN THE FRESH BEEF AIN'T BEEN SENT OUT FROM THE SETTLEMENT YIT
A MIGHTY FLIER HIS SHORT MUSCULAR WINGS DROVE HIM THROUGH THE AIR AT A SPEED NOT MUCH LESS THAN NINETY OR A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR
AND AWAY IN THE SHADOWS OF THE FIRS THE BEAR DREW A LITTLE NEARER ENCOURAGED BY THE FADING OF DAYLIGHT
HAVING KILLED THE WRITHING FISH THE LYNX TURNED SHARP ABOUT CROUCHED WITH ONE PAW ON THE PRIZE AND EYED THE APPROACHING OTTER WARILY
AND WHEN HE WAS BIG ENOUGH TO BEGIN HIS BOYISH HUNTING AND TO FOLLOW THE TRAILS AMONG THE DARK SPRUCE FORESTS IT BEGAN TO BE RUMORED THAT HE WAS IN SOME SPECIAL FAVOR WITH THE WOLF FOLK
FROM HERD TO HERD HE STAGGERED MET ALWAYS BY A CIRCLE OF LOWERED HORNS AND ANGRY EYES AND SO WENT STUMBLING BACK TO THAT LONELY DOOM WHICH WITHOUT CONCERN HE HAD SEEN METED OUT TO SO MANY OF HIS FELLOWS BUT HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF AS POSSIBLE TO HIMSELF
HE COULD NOT SEE THE ENEMY BUT HE SMELLED THEM ALL TOO CLEARLY
HE STOOD STARING AT MCLAGGAN FOR SEVERAL SECONDS BUT MCLAGGAN SAW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE FEAR IN THAT INSOLENT AND FLAMING REGARD
YOU'RE SURE SOME PUNKINS DECLARED MCLAGGAN ADMIRINGLY WIPING HIS EYES ON HIS SLEEVE
HE SPREAD HIS LEGS WIDE AND DEVOTED HIMSELF TO IT WITH ALL HIS ENERGIES
WITH HEAD UPLIFTED ABOVE HER RECLINING PARTNERS SHE LAY THERE VERY CONTENTEDLY EARS ALERT AND EYES HALF CLOSED
THE LITTLE ONE'S ASTOUNDING GROWTH--FOR THE CUBS OF THE BEAR ARE BORN VERY SMALL AND SO MUST LOSE NO TIME IN MAKING UP ARREARS OF STATURE--WAS AN AFFAIR FOR WHICH SHE TOOK ALL CREDIT TO HERSELF
IT WAS QUITE TOO FAR OFF TO GIVE THE RAM ANY CONCERN
AGAIN AND AGAIN AS THE OUTER RANKS DWINDLED BROWN BULL FOUND HIMSELF NEARING THE DANGER ZONE AND DISCREETLY ON EACH OCCASION HE WORKED HIS HERD IN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS NEARER THE CENTER
TAKING REFUGE ON A SMALL ICEBERG HE HAD BEEN CARRIED SOUTH TILL THE BERG SUDDENLY DISINTEGRATING HAD FORCED HIM TO DARE THE LONG LANDWARD FLIGHT
THEN HE LAY QUITE STILL WHILE THE HERON STANDING AT FULL HEIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE OUTRAGED NEST STABBED REPEATEDLY AND WITH SLOW DELIBERATION AT THE UNRESISTING MASS OF SHADOWY FEATHERS
AND HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF PERFECTLY OUT OF SIGHT WHICH FORCED HIM TO TAKE THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE UNDERBRUSH FOR HIS PATH
BRANNIGAN WAS NOW WATCHING HIS PARTNER NARROWLY IN THE GLOOM NOTING HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE DROOP OF HIS HEAD SINCE HE COULD NO LONGER MAKE MUCH OF HIS FACE
IT WAS ASTONISHINGLY EASY WORK
FOR A DAY HE WANDERED DISCONSOLATELY OVER AND ABOUT THE RUINS WOOF COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL
ROBERTS THE BACKWOODSMEN ILLUSTRATED
IF HE WENT TO THE HELP OF THE HUNTED MAN HE MIGHT MORE THAN PROBABLY HIMSELF BE PULLED DOWN AND DEVOURED BY THE RAVENING PACK
HE HAD A GREAT FRAME AND IMMENSE MUSCULAR POWER BUT BEING GAUNT AND STRINGY HE HAD NO RESERVES OF FAT IN HIS HARD TISSUES TO DRAW UPON IN SUCH AN EMERGENCY AS THIS
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S CONVULSIVE FLAPPING OF THE MOTTLED BROWN WINGS BENEATH THE OVERSHADOWING GRAY ONES
HE THOUGHT HE WAS HAVING A NIGHTMARE
SOMETHING CALLED TO HIM
HIS ROUND BLACK SAVAGE MOON-FACE WITH ITS PALE EYES BRIGHT AND HARD ITS STIFF WHISKERS AND ITS TUFTED EARS WOULD BE HELD DOWN SO CLOSE TO THE GLASSY SURFACE THAT THE CONFUSED REFLECTIONS OF THE OVERHANGING BRANCHES WERE UNABLE TO INTERFERE WITH HIS VISION AND HE COULD SEE WITH PERFECT CLEARNESS EVERY DETAIL OF THE TRANSPARENT DEPTHS
HE BARED HIS TEETH IN SCORN AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE FAIRLY SOWED THAT SECTION OF THE FOREST WITH SNARES AND TRAPS
BUT THE BIG FISH SWIMMING SO CALMLY IN ITS DEPTHS WERE SAFE FROM THEM BECAUSE IT WAS SO OVERHUNG THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO SWOOP DOWN UPON IT WITH ANY EFFECTIVE SPEED
THIS TIME HE DID NOT RESUME HIS FEEDING BUT STOOD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES SHIFTING HIS FEET UNEASILY UNTIL HE HAD QUITE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE PONIES WHICH HE SAW EMERGING FROM A CLEFT IN THE FOOTHILLS WERE NOT A HARMLESS WILD TROOP BUT CARRIED EACH A RED RIDER
WE WILL TAKE HIM WITH US HE SAID AT LAST AND GIVE HIM THE BURIAL OF A CHIEF
HE CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE STILL IN THE BASKET AND THAT THE OWL WAS TRYING TO GET AT THEM
WHEN THE FIRST EAGLE SMITTEN WITH FEAR BY THE VISION OF THE SWIFTLY MOUNTING AEROPLANE FLED BACK TO HIS EYRIE TO WARN HIS FIERCE-EYED MATE OF THIS PORTENTOUS MONSTER OF THE AIR HIS PERTURBATION WAS DETECTED BY THE FEMALE OF THE NEXT PAIR WHO CHANCED TO BE HOMING AT THAT MOMENT WITH A FISH FOR HER HUNGRY NESTLINGS
THE SILENCE IN HIS EARS WAS ABSOLUTE SAVE FOR THE OCCASIONAL THROB OF THUNDER FROM A WATERFALL LEAPING OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAWN A THOUSAND FEET BELOW AND HEARD ONLY WHEN SOME WANDERING EDDY OF AIR PULSED UPWARD FROM THE DEPTHS
BUT SHE HAD A FRIENDLY SPIRIT TOWARD ALL THE WORLD AND MET LONG JACKSON'S ADVANCES GRACIOUSLY
FOR A DAY HE WANDERED DISCONSOLATELY OVER AND ABOUT THE RUINS WHINING AND SNIFFING AND FILLED WITH A SENSE OF INJURY AT BEING THUS DESERTED
IT SEEMED TO OCCUR TO THEM THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL THE MAN DID NOT WANT THEIR NESTS
BUT IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES SHE WAS BACK AGAIN AND STOOD TREMBLING BEHIND LONG JACKSON
LIGHTING MATCH AFTER MATCH SHE HUNTED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO SERVE AS FUEL FOR SHE CRAVED THE COMFORT AS WELL AS THE WARMTH OF A FIRE
AS LONG AS THE HEIFER LASTED WOOF STUCK FAITHFULLY TO HIS POST AS GUARDIAN AND LONGER INDEED
BUT HE FELT IT WAS NOT BERRIES THAT HE HAD COME FOR
IN TWOS AND THREES THEY PROWLED SILENT AND GRIMLY WATCHFUL HANGING ON THE FLANKS OF THE HOST OR PICKING THEIR WAY IN ITS VAST BETRAMPLED DESOLATED TRAIL
WHY SHOULD HE NOT CLIMB UP AND HELP HIMSELF
BEST KNOCK THE CA'F ON THE HEAD TOO WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT SAID LONG JACKSON PRACTICALLY
HE BEGAN AFTER LONG SELF-RESTRAINT TO CURSE SOFTLY UNDER HIS BREATH AS HE GLARED ABOUT HIM FOR THE MOST PRACTICAL EXIT FROM THE MAZE
HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIS UNSEEN STEALTHY PURSUER
THIS WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO HER SINCE SHE WAS ALREADY IN A SENSE AT HOME
MEBBE I'D OUGHTER SHOOT THE LITTLE BEGGAR TOO HE MUSED OR THE BEARS LL JEST GET IT BUT BEING RATHER TENDER-HEARTED WHERE ALL YOUNG THINGS WERE CONCERNED HE DECIDED THAT IT MIGHT BE BIG ENOUGH TO LOOK AFTER ITSELF AND SO SHOULD HAVE ITS CHANCE
HIS SIXTH SENSE STOPPED WORKING
THE BEAR SET HIS TEETH INTO HER THROAT WITH A WINDY GRUNT OF SATISFACTION
THE AIR ALMOST SPARKLED WITH ITS CLARITY AND THERE WAS AN UNSPRINGLIKE TANG IN IT WHICH MADE MACCREEDY'S NERVES TINGLE FOR ADVENTURE
THEY MUST HAVE A REAL FIRE AND A REAL SLEEP IF THEY WERE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF WINNING THROUGH TO CONROY'S CAMP
HE KNEW THAT HAD THE RACE BEFORE HIM BEEN A LONG ONE IT COULD HAVE BUT ONE RESULT
LIGHTING ONE SHE SHADED IT WITH HER HAND CREPT FORWARD AND CAUTIOUSLY PEERED INSIDE
AND FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS THERE BEING NO PERIL IN SIGHT ITS WARY CAPTAIN SUFFERED IT TO LEAD THE MARCH
HE DROPPED HIS RIFLE WITH A GROWL OF VEXATION
THERE HAD BEEN ALREADY GROWLS OF PROTEST FROM THE MEN OF THE CAMP WHO UNDERSTOOD AS HE COULD NOT THE SENTIMENT OF THEIR GUESTS
AT LAST THE WHITE MARAUDERS SATIATED WITH SLAUGHTER DROPPED BEHIND AND IMMEDIATELY THE HOST NOW SHRUNKEN BY NEARLY A THIRD SLACKENED ITS PACE AND SEEMED TO FORGET ITS PUNISHMENT
SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS STRANGE DEPARTURE OF HER MOTHER
WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER,--BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
UNLIKE THE FULL-GROWN LYNX WHOSE FUR IS OF A TAWNY SHADOWY GRAY THESE YOUNGSTERS HAD SLEEK BRILLIANT COATS ADORNED WITH STRIPES LIKE A TIGER'S
THEN HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE OTHER WHICH THOUGH AT A TERRIFIC DISADVANTAGE WAS STILL RAKING JEFF MURDEROUSLY WITH ITS HINDER CLAWS
WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS MISGIVINGS HE DREW A BEAD ON THE UNGAINLY ANIMAL AS SHE EMERGED WITH STREAMING FLANKS FROM THE WATER AND STRODE UP TOWARD THE THICKETS WHICH FRINGED THE WHITE BEACH
BEFORE HE HAD GAINED THE COVER OF THE FIR TREES THE MINK GLIDED FORTH PLANTED HIS FOREPAWS ON THE REMAINING FISH AND STOOD STARING AFTER HIM IN AN ATTITUDE OF CHALLENGE
HIS TRUSTING HERD CAME WITH HIM
THE CAMP WAS SMALL BUT DRY AND IN GOOD REPAIR
SHE LIT ONE MORE PRECIOUS MATCH EXAMINED THE MECHANISM AND HUNTED FRANTICALLY FOR A SPLINTER OF WOOD WITH WHICH TO JAM IT DOWN
SHE LOVED THE CUB WITH A CERTAIN EXTRAVAGANCE AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO IT UTTERLY
FOR THE DOG THEY HAD NOTHING BUT SCORN
THEY GATHERED BIRCH BARK AND WITHERED PINE SHAVINGS AND KINDLINGS OF DEAD WOOD AND GATHERED A STORE OF BRANCHES CURSING GRIMLY OVER THEIR LACK OF AN AXE
HIS TRAINED EARS INTERPRETED THE SOUND AT ONCE
HE MOUNTED SWIFTLY AS HE WENT AND THE SPECTATORS STARED AFTER HIM DOUBTFULLY TILL THEY GRASPED HIS PURPOSE
THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN-BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK-AND-WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
IF YOU WANT THE CUB JINNY HE'S YOUR'N ALL RIGHT
FOR AN HOUR HE SAT THERE WITH FAST-SHUT EYES IN THE BROAD BLAZE OF THE SUNSHINE WHILE LIFE CREPT SLOWLY BACK ALONG HIS INDOMITABLE BUT EXHAUSTED NERVES
WHETHER AS IN MOST CASES THE LEADERS FELL OR AS IN OTHER INSTANCES THEY ESCAPED THE ROLLING TORRENT SPLIT AND PARTED AT ONCE TO EITHER SIDE AS IF THE FLAME AND ROAR FROM THE MUZZLES OF THE GUNS HAD BEEN SO MANY SHOULDERS OF ROCK
HE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT EVEN HAVE ATTACKED HIM IN THE OPEN IF SHE HAD COME UP WITH HIM WHILE HE HAD THE KITTENS ON HIM
THEN WITH THE STRING OF FISH DANGLING BESIDE HIS BUNDLE AND FLAPPING AGAINST IT AS HE WALKED HE RESUMED HIS SOLITARY JOURNEY PICKED HIS WAY OVER THE DILAPIDATED BRIDGE AND VANISHED INTO THE FIR FOREST BEYOND
SMARTING WITH PAIN AND WRATH AND WITH HIS HEART IN HIS MOUTH LEST THE STAYS SHOULD SNAP AND THE PLANES COLLAPSE MACCREEDY CUT OFF THE POWER AND SLID SHARPLY DOWNWARD
BLUE FOX STOLE BACK AND ROUSED THE OCCUPANTS OF THE NEAREST BURROWS
BOTH MEN SLEPT
BUT HE WAS VERY HUNGRY
THE HORDES OF HIS ASSAILANTS WERE WITHIN A DOZEN PACES OF HIM WHEN SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED THRUSTING OUT THEIR FOREFEET WITH VIOLENCE AND GOING BACK UPON THEIR HAUNCHES WITH LOW SNARLS
THE MEN OF THE VILLAGE PIPE IN HAND AND WEARY-EYED WITH THEIR WINTER INACTIVITY LOOKED AFTER HIM FROM THEIR DOORWAYS AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS
IT WAS FOOD LONG JACKSON WANTED--FOOD AND SLEEP
HE FELT THAT AT ANY MOMENT ONE MIGHT PLUCK UP COURAGE TO POUNCE UPON THE PLANE OR UPON HIS HEAD
HE KNEW THAT NO WOLF-CLAWS COULD MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON THE HARD-FROZEN EARTH SURROUNDING THE INNER PORTALS OF THE COLONY
AND THEY HAD MELTED BEFORE HIM
KEYED NOW TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF ANTICIPATION WITH EVERY FACULTY CONCENTRATED ON HIS PURPOSE HE WORKED HIS SILENT WAY ONWARD EXPECTING MOMENTLY TO GAIN A VIEW OF THE GREAT RAM
BUT WHAT WAS THAT NOISE WE HEARD ALONG ABOUT AN HOUR BACK
AN OLD MALE HAD CLAWED HIS DOG SO SEVERELY THAT THE DOG HAD LOST ITS NERVE AND ALL VALUE AS A HUNTING PARTNER
SHE TREMBLING AND WITH PANTING SIDES CROWDED CLOSE AGAINST HER RESCUER WHO FOR HIS PART KEPT SCRUTINIZING THE EDGES OF THE TIMBER TO SEE IF THE ENEMY WERE GOING TO FOLLOW UP THE ATTACK
OR POSSIBLY THEY THINK FROM THESE HIS LEAVINGS TO LEARN SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT OF MAN'S MYSTERIOUS OVER-LORDSHIP
THEN HE WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN FOR HE HAD LONG ARREARS TO MAKE UP AND THE HOT GLOW OF AFTERNOON WAS STILL HEAVY ON THE REACHES OF SEA AND GRASS
HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
KNOWING THEMSELVES BEATEN THEY DREW BACK WITH SCORCHED FACES AND SMARTING EYES AND STOOD WATCHING DISCONSOLATELY THE RUIN OF THEIR HOME
IN FACT AFTER THE FASHION OF A CORMORANT OR A KINGFISHER HE WAS PERCHED MOTIONLESS ON A BIG DEAD STUB OF A BRANCH
THEN HE KNEW IT WAS AN ILLUSION OF HIS EYES STRAINING SUDDENLY IN THAT ILLUSIVE LIGHT
BUT BLUE FOX BREATHLESS AND TRIUMPHANT ONLY SHOWED HIS TEETH DERISIVELY
NEVERTHELESS EVEN HIS WELL-GROUNDED FEAR OF THOSE HUMAN FOES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS ALMOST PANICKY FOREBODINGS
AH YES TO BE SURE THERE WAS THE BRIGHT UNSULLIED TIN OF MOLASSES JUST WHERE HE HAD HURLED IT
IN THE MEANTIME THE PANTHER WAS CLAWING AND BITING SAVAGELY AND SEEMED LIKELY TO MAINTAIN HIS HOLD IN SPITE OF THE CLEVER TACTICS OF HIS ADVERSARY
WHIRLING ANGRILY ON HIS HEEL HE RESUMED HIS LONG LOOSE-KNEED WOODSMAN'S STRIDE
HE CROUCHED BACK IN THE BUNK MAKING HIMSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND HOPING THAT A CERTAIN HUNK OF BACON ON THE BENCH BY THE STOVE MIGHT DIVERT THE TERRIBLE STRANGER'S ATTENTION AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO MAKE A BOLT FOR THE DOOR
YE'RE SURE SOME DAWG
HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN AN OWL OF THIS GHOSTLY COLOR OR OF EVEN HALF THIS SIZE
THERE WAS SOMETHING MASTERFUL IN HIS BEARING--AS THE GRIZZLY HAD OBSERVED FROM SAFE AMBUSH ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS--WHICH SUGGESTED UNKNOWN POWERS AND HITHERTO THE OLD SILVER-TIP BEING WELL FED AND HAVING NO SPECIAL GRUDGE AGAINST MAN HAD REFRAINED FROM COURTING A QUARREL
THERE STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WAS A DARK YOUNG MOOSE COW WITH A TWO-MONTHS CALF AT HER SIDE WADING ASHORE THROUGH THE SHADOWS
UNCONSCIOUSLY HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ORPHANED HELPLESSNESS THOUGH HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE PUT ALL THE BLAME UPON THE BEAR
AMONG THE LEGENDS WHICH HAD GATHERED ABOUT THE AUSTERE SUMMIT THERE WAS NONE TO SUGGEST THAT GOLD MIGHT BE FOUND THEREON ELSE THE CLOUDY SANCTUARY HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN VIOLATED WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE FOR THE FINAL GLIDE WHEN ONE OF THE FEMALE EAGLES GROWING DESPERATE SWOOPED AND STRUCK THE RIGHT WING OF THE PLANE NOT FAR FROM ITS TIP
IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO BE GLAD THAT THE BEAR WAS SUCH A BIG ONE
BUT THE GREAT GRAY OWL NEVER MOVED A FEATHER
HAVING CHEWED A FEW MOUTHFULS AND SPAT THEM OUT HE GOT UP OUT OF THE SNOW AND PLUNGED ON WITH A BURST OF NEW DETERMINATION
WHEN HOWEVER HE CAME UPON A GLOSSY YOUNG SHE-BEAR HER FINE BLACK MUZZLE BEDAUBED WITH BERRY JUICE HIS EYES WERE OPENED TO THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST
HE MET IT FAIRLY HOWEVER AND STEADILY AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT HE WAS IN NO WAY DAUNTED
THEN ON THREE LEGS AND GRUNTING WITH RAGE HE HAD LAUNCHED HIMSELF UPON HIS ADVERSARY
GEE BUT YE'RE CHOCK-FULL O GINGER SAID HE
THE DEAD BRANCH FLEW HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR AND SMOTE JOHN HATCH VIOLENTLY ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD
HE HAD KEPT GOING FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS ON HIS NAKED NERVE
YE'D BE NO MANNER O USE TO YER FRIENDS THAT WAY
MACCREEDY HAD BROUGHT HIS PLANE TO A LEVEL KEEL THE BETTER TO WITHSTAND THE ATTACK
LONG JACKSON TURNED GRAVELY TO THE CALF
SHE RAN BACK TO THE LITTLE ONE NOSED IT GENTLY INTO A CORNER AND ANXIOUSLY PAWED SOME DRY LEAVES HALF OVER IT
IN THE SAME INSTANT THE WOLVES CLOSED IN
THE AUTUMN DAYS WERE SUNNY BENEATH A SKY BATHED IN DREAM
BUT ENTHUSIASM OVER YOUNG PASTURAGE MAY MAKE EVEN A MOUNTAIN SHEEP ABSENT-MINDED
HE HUNTED STEALTHILY NOW AS NOISELESS AND FURTIVE AS ANY OF THE WILD KINDRED THEMSELVES
AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF THESE MOST DREADED FOES BROWN BULL HAD DISCREETLY EDGED HIS HERD BACK A LITTLE WAY INTO THE HOST SO THAT IT NO LONGER FORMED THE VANGUARD
HE LOVED MUTTON AND HE KNEW IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET ESPECIALLY FOR A BEAR
BUT IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART HE GREW MORE AND MORE UNEASY
IT IS SUCH UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS TAUGHT FISHERMEN THE VIRTUES OF PATIENCE AND HOPE
THAT IS THE OLD WHITE WOLF HOWLING ON THE MOUNTAIN
A GLANCE OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE RAN SHOWED HIM THAT THE GRAY SHAPES WERE OVERHAULING HIM
JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE GRASS THE BLEACHED RIBS OF AN ANCIENT FISHING-SMACK BORNE THITHER YEARS AGO IN SOME TEMPESTUOUS CONSPIRACY OF WIND AND TIDE STOOD UP NAKEDLY FROM THE DRY RED MUD AND SEEMED TO BEG THE LEANING GRASS TO COVER THEM
AT THAT MOMENT BRANNIGAN FIRED
BUT WHEN THE HARD FROSTS CAME SEALING UP THE MOIST TURF UNDER A CRUST OF STEEL AND THE SNOWS BURYING THE MOUSE-HOLES UNDER THREE OR FOUR FEET OF WHITE FLUFF THEN HE WAS HARD PUT TO IT FOR A LIVING
BUT FOR ALL THIS HE WAS NO LONGER ANGRY
NOT ONE WAS TROUBLED WITH APPREHENSION
BUT THIS MORNING HIS PATIENCE WAS BEING SORELY TRIED
IN A HALF-HOUR BRANNIGAN'S VIGILANT SUBCONSCIOUSNESS WOKE HIM UP WITH A START
THE HAWK FOLLOWED HIS WING-TIPS NOW ALMOST BRUSHING THE WATER
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE FEAR AND FAMINE IN THAT FAR-OFF WIGWAM DEEP IN THE SNOWS WHILE HE HERE UNDER THE WHITE MAN'S ROOF WAS WARM AND WELL FED
THE GRAY VISITOR SPRANG INTO THE AIR IN ORDER TO GIVE BATTLE ON MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS
PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
HE AIMED AT THE MIDDLE OF THE BEAST'S THROAT TRUSTING TO SEVER THE SPINAL COLUMN FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT A SHOT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OFTEN FAILS TO STOP THE RUSH OF A GRIZZLY
IN THE FIRST SWEET INDOLENCE OF SPRING HE HAD PUT FAR FROM HIM THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE FAMINE SEASON
SHE SEEMED VERY SMALL THIS NEW MOTHER AND SHE HAD A DISQUIETING ODOR
HE FETCHED A HUGE BREATH OF SATISFACTION AS HE GAINED A LITTLE STRIP OF LEVEL LEDGE PERHAPS A DOZEN FEET IN LENGTH WITH A SCRUBBY SPRUCE BUSH GROWING AT THE OTHER END OF IT
THEN HE PICKED OUT A LARGER ONE AS IF HE REGARDED THE FIRST AS MERELY AN APPETIZER
NO SIR-EE BUT THE SCARRED DOG A LEAN BLACK-AND-TAN MONGREL WITH SOME COLLIE STRAIN REVEALED IN HIS FEATHERING AND IN HIS LONG NARROW JAW STIRRED UNEASILY IN HIS SLEEP AND WHIMPERED
HE APPROACHED THEREFORE WITHOUT HESITATION
AS IF AT A SIGNAL THEY SHOT FROM COVERT AND LAUNCHED THEMSELVES A TORRENT OF SHADOWY FLAME-EYED LEAPING SHAPES UPON THE MAN
AT LENGTH HE STEPPED FORTH MINCINGLY INTO FULL VIEW TROTTED UP AND SNIFFED INQUISITIVELY
HE HAD BEEN RATHER TAKEN ABACK BY THE SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH THE DOOR HAD FLOWN OPEN AND HAD HESITATED TO ENTER FEARING A TRAP
BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE WOODS ONCE MORE CAME THAT WARNING AND UNCANNY CREEP AT THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR
FOR A MOMENT THE FISHERMAN BEWILDERED TRIED TO PLAY HIM LIKE A SALMON
BABE AND HIS UNCLE ANDY AND BILL THE GUIDE ARE CAMPING IN THE WILDERNESS
INSTEAD OF FORSAKING THE HOST HE LED HIS HERD DOWN THE KNOLL AND INSINUATED IT INTO A GAP IN THE RANKS
CLANCY SPRANG FORWARD WITH AN OATH BUT RIGHT IN HIS PATH ROSE BRANNIGAN QUIET AND COLD
THIS WAS AN INDIGNITY THAT HE COULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED OF
THE WINDLESS AIR WAS FAINTLY MUSICAL WITH THE HUM OF INSECTS AND WITH THE OCCASIONAL SQUEAKS AND SCURRYINGS OF UNSEEN LEMMING MICE IN THEIR SECRET ROADWAYS UNDER THE DENSE GREEN SPHAGNUM
THE DUCK WAS A HANDSOME MALE OF THE RED-BREASTED MERGANSER FAMILY AND THE ABSORBING INTEREST OF HIS LIFE WAS FISH
HULLO SAID HE
AT LAST THE DOOMED TROUT FLASHED UP BENEATH THE POINT OF THE ROOT AND DOUBLED JUST AT THE SURFACE
THE AXE WAS KEEN AND UNDER THE BITE OF ITS RHYTHMIC STROKES THE BIG WHITE CHIPS FLEW OFF KEENLY
SHE SPRANG INTO THE AIR WITHOUT AN EFFORT HUNG FOR A MOMENT TO GLARE DOWN UPON THE FOX WITH HER HARD ROUND MOON-PALE EYES AND THEN SAILED OFF WITHOUT A SOUND HAVING NO MIND TO TRY CONCLUSIONS WITH THE LONG-JAWED RED STRANGER
CROUCHING FLAT WITH EARS BACK AND TEETH BARED TO THE SOCKETS SHE HAD GLARED ABOUT HER WITH TERRIBLE EYES AS IF THINKING THAT THE RAVISHER MIGHT YET BE WITHIN REACH
THERE'S A DURN BIG PAINTER HIDIN SOMEWHERES IN THEM BUSHES YONDER AN WHILE YE'RE A-CLAW-IN AFTER ME--WHICH AIN'T NO USE AT ALL--HE'LL BE GETTING HIS CLAWS INTER YOU FIRST THING YE KNOW BUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE BULL DID NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH OR AT LEAST MCLAGGAN'S PRIMITIVE VARIATION ON ENGLISH
SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET
THEN WE'D BETTER GIT A MOVE ON SAID JACKSON
HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE CHALLENGE BUT THE HARSH THIN CRY SEEMED TO BREAK HIS TRANCE
TO THE SLIM GIRL WHO BUNDLE IN HAND AND WITH SKIRTS TUCKED UP HALF-WAY TO THE KNEE WAS PICKING HER STEPS ALONG THIS EXASPERATING PATH THE WILDNESS OF THE SCENE--ITS MINGLED HARSHNESS AND DELICACY--BROUGHT A PANG WHICH SHE COULD BUT DIMLY UNDERSTAND
THEN SOMETHING LIKE A BROWN WEDGE DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY
THE OUTRAGED COW CAME ON AGAIN FURIOUS AND TRIUMPHANT THINKING TO END THE MATTER WITH A RUSH
IN THE NEAREST TREE NOT FAR FROM THE TOP WAS WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN IMMENSE ACCUMULATION OF DEAD STICKS
HIS MIGHTY TALONS CLOSED ON THE NECK AND BACK OF THE FEASTING HAWK
NOW AT LAST THE CRISIS WAS TRULY AND INEVITABLY UPON HER
THERE IS NO PEACE COUNSELLOR LIKE A CONTENTED BELLY
HE LISTENED BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND IN ALL THAT LIFELESS WORLD SAVE A GHOSTLY SETTLING OF THE SNOW SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM
HERE'S BACCY AN ME PIPE AN A BIT O STRING AN A CROOKED NAIL
WHAT HE DREADED WAS THAT THE STARTING OF THE MOTOR MIGHT REVIVE THE FEARS OF THE GREAT BIRDS IN REGARD TO THEIR NESTS AND BRING THEM ONCE MORE SWOOPING UPON HIM
AIN'T YER GOT ENOUGH FRESH MEAT IN THIS ERE COW I'VE FORAGED FER YE
BUT_--EF TWASN'T MARY_--THAT'S ALL I SAY RIGHT YE ARE LONG SAID BRANNIGAN QUITE MOLLIFIED
IN THAT SECOND THE VANQUISHED ONE WRITHED NIMBLY TO HIS FEET AND SLIPPED OFF APOLOGETICALLY THROUGH THE SNOW
BUT THIS BEAR CONSIDERED HIMSELF UNDER SPECIAL STRESS
HE SAW JEFF WITH ONE LYNX DOWN SLASHING AT ITS THROAT FRONTISPIECE HOOF AND CLAW BY CHARLES G
THEN A LITTLE DAZED BUT UNDETERRED FROM HIS VENGEANCE HE GLARED ABOUT HIM FOR HIS ORIGINAL ANTAGONIST
THE ARCTIC HARES WERE STILL ABUNDANT AND NOT YET OVERWILD FROM CEASELESS HARRYING
ALMOST IN THE SAME INSTANT HE REALIZED THAT AN IMMENSE EAGLE WAS SWOOPING STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD
HIS PRONGED ANTLERS RIPPED IT WIDE OPEN MCLAGGAN WAS NOW TOO ANGRY TO APPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY APPEARANCE OF HIS FOE
HE WAS DEADLY COLD AND THE FIRE HAD BURNED DOWN TO A LITTLE HEAP OF RED EMBERS
A WATCHER DIRECTLY OVERHEAD ESCAPING THE BAFFLING REFLECTIONS MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM SWIMMING HEAD OUTSTRETCHED MASTERING THE TREMENDOUS RUSH OF THE STREAM WITH MIGHTY STROKES FAIRLY OUT-SPEEDING THE FISH IN THEIR OWN ELEMENT
AND PERHAPS THE OLD WHITE WANDERER WHO DISDAINS TO HUNT WITH THE PACK WILL BEFRIEND HIM AND BRING HIM GOOD FORTUNE HIS NAME IS WIND IN-THE-NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER IN A VOICE SUDDENLY LOUD AND PIERCING
FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD LIFT HIS RED-RIMMED NOSTRILS SNIFF THE AIR IN EVERY DIRECTION AND SCAN THE SUMMITS OF THE FOOTHILLS FAR ON THE RIGHT AS IF THE UNKNOWN PERIL WHICH HE APPREHENDED WAS LIKELY TO COME FROM THAT DIRECTION
NEITHER INDIANS NOR WHITE MEN APPROACHED THIS STAGE OF THE MIGRATION
WITH HIS KNIFE HE CUT OFF SEVERAL BIG HANDFULS OF THE SHAGGY FUR AND STUFFED IT INTO HIS POCKETS
PHLEGMATIC AND SHORT OF MEMORY THE HERDS WERE RESTORED TO CONTENT BY A DAY OF HEAVY RAIN WHICH LAID THE DUST AND FRESHENED THEIR HIDES AND INSTILLED NEW SWEETNESS INTO THE COARSE PLAINS GRASSES
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ALL THROUGH THE GOLDEN DREAMY AUTUMN OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK WOODS THE TWO ROAMED TOGETHER
WE'LL SEE THIS THING THROUGH WITH MARY ON THE SQUARE YOU BET
THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER BUT A FEW HANDFULS OF DRY FINE SPRUCE TIPS LEFT IN ONE OF THE BUNKS
HE CAME JUST IN TIME TO SEE FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING THE VICTIM STRICKEN DOWN
PRESENTLY HE STOOPED DOWN AND STROKED THE HUDDLE OF SHINING FUR
HE WAS INCLINED TO TURN AND FLY BACK TO THE SHELTER OF OLD BALD FACE BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S IRRESOLUTION HIS STOUT HEART AROSE TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PERIL
THE GRAY VISITOR HOPPED OVER TO THIS POINT AND WAITED HOPEFULLY LIKE A CAT AT A FREQUENTED MOUSE-HOLE
HATCH GRABBED UP HIS AXE
THEREFORE WHEN THE OLD BEAR GROWN TOO RESTLESS AND SAVAGE TO HIBERNATE HAD OFTEN TO ROAM THE DARKNESS HUNGRY AND WHEN THE WOLF-PACK WAS FORCED TO RANGE THE FROZEN LEAGUES FOR HARDLY MEAT ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR GAUNT FLANKS FROM FALLING IN THE PROVIDENT FOXES HAD LITTLE TO FEAR FROM EITHER COLD OR FAMINE
THE MAN SAT IN A HOLLOW IN THE STRANGE BIRD'S BACK BETWEEN ITS WINGS AND SEEMED TO MASTER AND GUIDE IT EVEN AS HE WOULD MASTER AND GUIDE A HORSE
HE DROPPED THE REINS AND SNATCHED UP HIS GUN FROM WHERE IT LAY ON TOP OF THE LOAD OF POLES
IN ANY CASE THE ATTRACTION SELDOM FAILS
ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER AND THE AUTUMN THIS MYSTERIOUS TRAILING WENT ON TILL HATCH DISGUSTED BY THE FUTILITY OF HIS ATTEMPTS TO SHAKE IT OFF ASSUMED INDIFFERENCE AND PRETENDED TO HIMSELF THAT HE RATHER LIKED BEING HAUNTED
AT LAST WITH A HEAVY HEART HE RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT
ONE DAY CHANCE LED HIM UPON ONE OF BLUE FOX'S STORAGE CELLARS
BUT THE LOFTY TOP OF A WATER ASH JUST MISSED BY THE SHORT WINGS OF THE FUGITIVE FORCED THE LONG PINION OF THE HAWK TO SWERVE A LITTLE SO THAT HE PARTLY MISSED HIS STROKE
GENTLY ENOUGH PERHAPS BUT WITH A FIRMNESS WHICH LEFT NO ROOM FOR ARGUMENT THE YOUNGSTERS HAD ALL BEEN TURNED OUT OF DOORS
YET NOT THE MOST STUPIDLY CASUAL COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FOR ANY ORDINARY DUCK
IN THE FRONT OF THE ATTACK WAS A GREAT WHITE BEAST SO SWIFT IN HIS LEAP THAT THE MAN HAD NO TIME TO SWING UP HIS WEAPON IN DEFENSE
IN THE MIDST OF THIS CONVULSION THE BULL SIDE-STEPPED AGAIN WITH DISTRESSING ENERGY AND THE PANTHER HALF-BLINDED AND WHOLLY BEWILDERED WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND
HE FELT IN HIS HEART HOWEVER THAT HE WAS TOO LATE THAT HE WOULD NEVER REACH THE FIRE
AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE WITH THE MEN WHO DWELL IN THE GREAT SILENCES HE WAS CONSCIOUS AT TIMES OF POSSESSING SOMETHING LIKE A SIXTH SENSE--A KIND OF INEXPLICABLE AND ERRATIC POWER OF PERCEPTION WHICH FREQUENTLY NEGLECTED TO EXERCISE ITSELF WHEN MOST NEEDED BUT WHICH WHEN IT DID CONSENT TO WORK WAS NEVER GUILTY OF GIVING A FALSE ALARM
THEY HAD NONE OF THE FAT PLACIDITY OF THE SUCKERS
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THIS STRAIGHT-BILLED NESTER COULD BE IN ANY WAY DANGEROUS
WISH'T I'D KNOW'D ENOUGH TO EAT A BIGGER SUPPER LAST NIGHT
AND HATCH WAS LEFT SITTING THERE WITH THE PAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS STARING FIXEDLY INTO THE DARK WOODS
FOR ONE PETRIFIED SECOND HE STARED STRAIGHT INTO THEM
THEY HAD A HARD WINTER BEFORE THEM BUT WITH GOOD HUNTING AND FAIR LUCK IN DODGING THE TRAPS AND OTHER PERILS THAT WERE BOUND TO DOG THEIR INEXPERIENCED FEET THEY WOULD RETURN NEXT SPRING RIPE WITH WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE DIG BURROWS OF THEIR OWN AND SETTLE DOWN TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ARCTIC FAMILY LIFE
THE ANGER FADED OUT FROM HIS SHREWD LIGHT-BLUE EYES
BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN THE PICTURE
SUDDENLY FROM FAR AHEAD THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY THE HIGH RESONANT BUGLING OF A BULL ELK
THEY WERE UNDECEIVED HOWEVER
THEY KILLED MORE HEEDLESSLY AND BRUTALLY THAN THE INDIANS FOR THE SAKE OF THE HIDES RATHER THAN FOR MEAT EACH MAN HURRIEDLY MARKING HIS OWN KILL AND THEN DASHING ON TO SEEK MORE VICTIMS
THE DOOR WAS SHUT BUT WOOF KNEW THAT DOORS FREQUENTLY OPENED IF ONE SCRATCHED AT THEM AND WHINED PERSUASIVELY
THE KNOWLEDGE CAME TO HER WITH SUCH A SHOCK THAT SHE STOPPED SHORT IN CONSTERNATION ALMOST DROPPING HER BUNDLE
BLUE FOX BASKING IN THE SUN WAS BY AND BY SEIZED WITH A RESTLESSNESS A SENSE OF SOME DUTY LEFT UNDONE
THE ASSAULT CAME NOWHERE NEAR HIS OWN CHARGES SO HE TREATED IT AS NONE OF HIS AFFAIR
HOT AS WAS HIS RAGE IT DID NOT BURN UP HIS DISCRETION
HE FOUND THE WOLVERINE HEAD DOWNWARD IN HIS CHOICEST CELLAR THE DANGER OF THE WOLVES WAS MORE TERRIBLE AND MORE DAUNTING
BUT EVEN SUCH POOR CONSOLATION SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED BEYOND HIS KEN
THE RAPIDS WOULD PRESENTLY COME TO AN END
FOR A FEW SECONDS BLUE FOX PAWED HIS PREY PLAYFULLY AS ONE OF HIS CUBS WOULD HAVE DONE
THEN AFTER ONE LONG AGONIZED SNIFF AT THE SPOT WHERE HER YOUNG HAD LAIN SHE HAD SPED AWAY NOISELESSLY DOWN THE STEEP RUNNING WITH NOSE TO THE BLATANT TRAIL AND WILD EYES PEERING AHEAD THROUGH THE TANGLE OF THE BRUSH
IT WAS A COMFORTABLE PICTURE FRAMED AS IN A NARROW PANEL BY THE DARK UPRIGHTS OF THE SPRUCE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MOSSY ROAD
AND THEN IT CAME TO HER
BOUNCING TO HIS FEET HE CLUTCHED THIS LATTER COMBATANT WITH BOTH HANDS BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WHIRLED IT AROUND HIS HEAD AND DASHED IT YOWLING WILDLY AGAINST A TREE
IT GALLED HIM TO THE MARROW TO WATCH HIS BIG ARROGANT BUSH-TAILED RIVAL COMPLACENTLY GULPING DOWN THOSE FINE FAT TROUT
ROBERTS WHICH COMPRISE THE VOLUME NEIGHBORS UNKNOWN.'"--_CHICAGO TRIBUNE WHAT OBSERVATION WHAT POWER OF DESCRIPTION IS DISPLAYED IN CHARLES G
BUT THAT THE FOOD THE SUCCOR HE WAS BRINGING SHOULD NEVER REACH THE WIGWAM--THIS THOUGHT TURNED HIS HEART COLD
HE WONDERED IF HIS LEATHER CAP WOULD BE STOUT ENOUGH TO RESIST THE CLUTCH OF THOSE EDGED TALONS WHICH HE SAW OPENING AND SHUTTING VICIOUSLY ABOVE HIM
IT WAS PERHAPS A CONVENIENCE IN SOME WAYS THAT HE SHOULD NOT KNOW HE WAS A BEAR--HE MIGHT BE THE MORE SECURE FROM TROUBLESOME ANCESTRAL SUGGESTIONS
BUT STILL IT DELAYED AND THE TENSION OF HIS SUSPENSE GREW ALMOST UNBEARABLE
THEN HE STOOD UP
BROWN BULL GAVE NO HEED TO HIS TRIUMPH IF INDEED HE REALIZED IT AT ALL
BUT SHE WAS ON A SECURE FOOTING AS MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD PETTED EXTRAVAGANTLY BY BRANNIGAN AND CORDIALLY ACCEPTED BY LONG JACKSON AS AN ALL-ROUND GOOD PARTNER
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIS CATSHIP
SUFFICE TO SAY THAT WHEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT UNDERWENT HIS INITIATION INTO THE STATUS OF FULL MANHOOD A GREAT WHITE WOLF PLAYED AN UNBIDDEN BUT NOT UNLOOKED-FOR PART IN IT
INSTEAD OF STRETCHIN YER FOOL NECK THAT WAY TRYIN TO GET AT ME HE EXPOSTULATED LEANING FROM HIS BRANCH YE'D A SIGHT BETTER BE KEEPIN YER EYES PEELED FER YER OWN HIDE
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE SEDATE OLD SORREL SHIED VIOLENTLY ALMOST KNOCKING HIM OVER AND THEN STARTED ON A WILD GALLOP DOWN THE ROAD SPILLING THE POLES IN EVERY DIRECTION AS SHE WENT
YES UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WERE FISH IN THE BASKET FRESH FISH--TROUT IN FACT
THE LYNX BEING SO SILENT AND DISCREET A FISHERMAN HIS FISHING NEVER DISTURBED THE POOL AT ALL OR CAST ANY SHADOW OF DOUBT UPON ITS REPUTATION AS A HAVEN OF SECURITY AND REPOSE
AND A FEELING THAT HE MIGHT BRING BACK SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION MADE THEM CONTENT TO WAIT WITHOUT GRUMBLING FOR HIS RETURN
THE TALL COCK-HERON WAS JUST SETTLING UPON THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM
BEHIND HIM MEANWHILE THE FLOCK WENT BOUNDING BY HEADED FOR THEIR HIGH REFUGE
NOW THE COOK THOUGH HE HAD BEEN UNDENIABLY FRIGHTENED WAS BY NO MEANS A FOOL
THE OTTER WAS AN INSOLENT TRESPASSER

BUT THE EAGLES WERE NOW IN A LESS MILITANT FRAME OF MIND
ON THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT AN ARCTIC TEMPEST SWEPT OVER THE PLAIN AN ICY RAIN DROVE LEVEL IN WHIPPING SHEETS THE LOW SKY WAS CROWDED WITH HURRYING RANKS OF TORN BLACK VAPOR AND THE WISE FOXES KEPT TO THEIR HOLES
THESE ENEMIES AS HE HAD KNOWN THEM STRUCK ALWAYS ON THE FLANKS OF THE HOST
THERE WAS NO COMPANIONSHIP FOR MARY LIKE THAT OF BRANNIGAN AND LONG JACKSON WHO KNEW SO CONSUMMATELY HOW TO SCRATCH HER LONG WAGGLING EARS
PETE ALLEN HAD ALWAYS PRIDED HIMSELF ON PLAYING FAIR IN THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS IN THE LETTER
HE SPRANG CARELESSLY OVER CREVICES WHOSE BOTTOMS WERE LOST IN BLACKNESS TILL AT LAST THE YOUNG-LEAVED BIRCH AND THE SOMBER POINTED FIR LAY JUST BELOW HIM SKIRTED BY THE STEEP RIBANDS AND INTERSECTED BY THE NARROW GLENS OF GREENING TURF
THE RAM SAW THE BEAR STRAIGHT IN HIS PATH PLUNGING ACROSS IT
BUT IT WAS AS DEAD AS A LAST YEAR'S MULLEIN STALK
THE GRAY VISITOR HAD NO NEED OF THOUGHT TO TELL HIM THAT THE LONG BLACK CREATURE BEFORE HIM WITH THE NARROW SNARLING MOUTH AND VENOMOUS EYES WAS DANGEROUS
SEEMS I DON'T KNOW'S MUCH ABOUT THESE HERE CRITTERS AS I THOUGHT I DID AND HE SLIPPED NOISELESSLY BACK INTO THE COVER OF A THICKET
HAVING HIS AXE WITH HIM HOWEVER AND THE NICEST OF WOODSMAN'S SKILL IN USING IT HE HAD HAD NO MISGIVINGS AT ANY MOMENT AND NOW THAT THE KITTENS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL HE DISMISSED THE WHOLE MATTER FROM HIS MIND
HIS COURAGE AND HIS CURIOSITY GAVE WAY TOGETHER AND HE FLED BACK IN A PANIC TO HIS LEDGE IN THE RECESSES OF OLD BALD FACE
BUT HERE ONCE MORE THE WHITE MAN CAME AGAINST THEM
RIVAL BULLS ROARED THEIR CHALLENGES PAWED THE EARTH FOUGHT SAVAGE DUELS WITH THEIR BATTERING FRONTS AND SHORT RIPPING HORNS AS THEY WENT
BUT HE WAS ONLY WARNED NOT DAUNTED
HE LAY WITH HIS FEET GATHERED UNDER HIM EVERY MUSCLE READY FOR ACTION EXPECTING EACH MOMENT TO FIND HIMSELF INVOLVED IN A DESPERATE BATTLE FOR THE PRIZE HE WAS ENJOYING
IT WAS THE TRAIL OF A MAN ON SNOWSHOES DRAWING A LOADED SLEDGE AND TRAVELING EASTWARD
AND THE GRAY VISITOR NOT BEING AT HOME WITH HIS SURROUNDINGS HAD NEGLECTED TO PREPARE FOR THE RETURN OF THE DEAD MOTHER'S MATE
HE DID IT HALF-UNCONSCIOUSLY SO ABSORBED WAS HE IN HIS THOUGHTS
BUT THEIR LEADER HAD CALCULATED CUNNINGLY AND THEY WERE WELL PAST THE TRACK OF DOOM
THEN ENVIOUS OF MARY WHO BROWSED WITH SATISFACTION ON SUCH TWIGS AND SAPLINGS AS CAME IN HER WAY THEY CUT YOUNG FIR BRANCHES PEELED THEM SCRAPED THE WHITE INNER BARK AND CHEWED MOUTHFULS OF THE SHAVINGS
HE SETS HIS TEETH AND HE DOES A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING
HE BOUNDED INTO THE WOOD ON THE LEFT OF THE TRACK PARTING THE UNDERGROWTH FURIOUSLY WITH BOTH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED BEFORE HIS FACE
AFTER A SECOND OR TWO HOWEVER HE CAME FORWARD WITH A SAVAGE RUSH FURIOUS AT HAVING BEEN SO LONG BALKED
THE VISITOR WAITED TILL THE RAT SHOULD COME WITHIN REACH OF AN UNERRING POUNCE
THE FUTILE MENACE OF IT ANGERED HIM KEENLY
WHAT DID CONCERN HIM WAS THE FACT THAT THE MONSTER WITH ITS HUMAN RIDER WAS APPARENTLY COMING UP AFTER HIM
HE WAS NOT HUNGRY FOR THE WASTES WERE JUST NOW SO ALIVE WITH NESTING BIRDS AND SWARMING LEMMINGS AND THEIR FAT LITTLE COUSINS THE LEMMING MICE THAT HIS HUNTING WAS A SWIFT AND EASY MATTER
FOR A LITTLE MCLAGGAN WAS ENGROSSED IN WONDERING IF HE REALLY WAS QUITE OUT OF REACH SO VIGOROUS WERE THE REARINGS AND THRUSTINGS OF HIS ENEMY SO AGILE THE HIGH STROKES OF THOSE FINE DESTRUCTIVE HOOFS
WHEN HOWEVER THE WINTER HAD ONCE SETTLED IN WITH FULL RIGOR HATCH FOUND THAT HE WAS BEING SHADOWED WITH LESS AND LESS INSISTENCE
AND THEY LEFT THEIR BLAZING HOME TO ROAR AND FUME AND VOMIT SPARKS AND FLARE ITSELF OUT IN THE UNHEEDING SOLITUDE
AN GOOD LUCK TO HER SES I
HIS TEMPER THEREFORE WAS RAW ENOUGH IN ANY CASE
WOOF WAGGED HIS HAUNCHES MORE COAXINGLY THAN EVER AND TOOK ANOTHER HOPEFUL STEP FORWARD
IN SPITE OF THE TERRIFIC COLD HE WAS WARM ENOUGH HERE WITH THE ROCK CLOSE AT HIS BACK THE SNOW BANKED UP AT EITHER SIDE AND HIS BLANKETS ABOUT HIM
HIS SHORT POWERFUL FOREPAWS MADE THE DRY TURF AND LIGHT EARTH FLY AND SPEEDILY HE CAME TO THE STORE OF FROZEN LEMMINGS
HAD THE BEAR BEEN A YOUNG ONE THE BATTLE THUS INAUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN MIGHT HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM AND THOSE LIGHTNING HOOVES WITH THEIR FAR-REACHING STROKE MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIM IN BLOOD AND IGNOMINY TO REFUGE IN A TREE
AND LIGHTLY THEY HAD DONE IT
HE PUSHED ON FURIOUSLY EXPECTING THIS PICTURE TO GREET HIS EYES AT EVERY TURN OF THE TRAIL
IT WAS THE HARDEST PIECE OF TRACKING HE HAD EVER TACKLED
BUT SKILLED AS HE WAS IN ALL THE LORE OF THE WILDERNESS FOLK HE KNEW THAT NO PANTHER UNLESS WITH SOME BITTER WRONG TO AVENGE WOULD WILLINGLY SEEK A QUARREL WITH A MAN
HE EYED THEM REGRETFULLY BUT HE HAD NOT THE FOX'S WIT OR PROVIDENCE TO CARRY THEM OFF AND HIDE THEM FOR FUTURE USE
AND THEN REALIZING THAT IT WAS NO USE HANGING ABOUT IN THE EXPECTATION THAT ANY FOX WOULD COME OUT TO BE EATEN THE WISE OLD PACK-LEADER SWUNG THE PACK INTO RANKS AND SWEPT THEM OFF TO HUNT OTHER QUARRY
BUT YOU TWO BOYS HAS BEEN BURNT OUT AN IN HARD LUCK SO I'LL GIVE YE THE PRICE O GOOD BEEF FOR THE CRITTER
SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO GO OUT AND GROPE ABOUT IN THE WET GLOOM FOR A SUPPLY OF DEAD BRANCHES THOUGH SHE WAS NOW CONSCIOUS OF A CHILDISH RELUCTANCE TO FACE AGAIN THE OUTER SOLITUDE
FOR A LONG TIME HE RESOLUTELY IGNORED IT
AFTER HE HAD WELL STUDIED THROUGH HIS GLASSES THE LAY OF THE RIDGES AND RAVINES ABOUT THE PEAK WHERE THE RAM WAS STANDING HE REENTERED THE TENT FOR HIS RIFLE
SWERVING CRAFTILY HE CAUGHT THE STROKE IN HIS WING FEATHERS AND SMOTHERED IT BUFFETING IT DOWN
AIDED BY HIS OWN SPRING IT LIFTED HIM CLEAN OVER THE STRUGGLING EWE'S BACK DOUBLED HIM TOGETHER AND DASHED HIM WITH STUNNING EFFECT AGAINST A TREE
HE HIMSELF SOARING IN THE BLUE HEIGHTS AS HE WAS FLEW ALMOST WITHOUT MOTION OF THE WINGS RIDING BY SUBTLE POISE AND BALANCE ON THE THRUST OF THE LIGHT AERIAL DRAUGHT
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THERE WAS LITTLE LEFT OF EITHER THE HAWK OR THE WATER-RAT
MOREOVER--THOUGH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HERSELF THAT SUCH A CONSIDERATION COULD COUNT FOR ANYTHING WHEN ALL HER THOUGHTS WERE ON HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS--SHE WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT CONNOR'S GANG WAS STREAM-DRIVING ON THE OTTANOONSIS AND WOULD BE BY NOW JUST ABOUT THE POINT WHERE THE LINE ROAD TOUCHES THE RIVER
HAIN'T YER GOT NO CONSIDERATION FOR MARY'S FEELINGS
IN THE GLADE BELOW ONE OF THE FLOCK HAD JUST BEEN POUNCED UPON BY A PUMA AND ANOTHER PUMA HAD SPRUNG OUT AT THEM BUT MISSED HIS KILL
IT WAS A VERITABLE BERSERK RAGE THIS VIRGIN OUTBURST OF HIS
IN SPITE OF HIS PASSIONATE REFUSAL OF THE GIGANTIC TITILLATION HIS HEAD WENT UP IN THE AIR HIS SPINE STRAIGHTENED ITSELF OUT HIS JAWS AND HIS CLAWS OPENED AND THE HUGE SNEEZE RIPPED STRIDENTLY FROM HIS LUNGS
A GUN WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL BELOW THE BUNK
HE WAS WORRYING NOW OVER THE QUESTION OF WHAT HE COULD GIVE THE INCONVENIENTLY CONFIDING LITTLE ANIMAL TO EAT
SOMEWHAT REASSURED TO FIND THAT THE MONSTER COULD BE DISCONCERTED BY THE SPURT OF A MATCH SHE GROPED BACK TO HER SEAT AND FELL TO COUNTING BY TOUCH THE NUMBER OF THESE FEEBLE WEAPONS STILL LEFT IN THE BOX
WITHIN A WEEK HE HAD TAKEN A WEASEL THREE WOODCHUCKS HALF A DOZEN SKUNKS AND THIRTEEN RABBITS
A MOMENT MORE AND HE PLUNGED DOWNWARD WITH A HEAVY SWIRL BUT SMOOTHLY AS IF OILED
THE BEST SHE COULD HOPE WAS TO REACH THE RIVER-SHORE BEFORE DARK AND PERHAPS FIND THE CAMP OF THE STREAM-DRIVERS
BUT FOR SOME MINUTES HE PUT UP A FIGHT WHICH FOR SWIFT FEROCITY ALMOST DAUNTED THE HITHERTO UNAWAKENED SPIRIT OF WOOF
THEN IN A MINUTE OR TWO MORE IT WOULD OPEN OUT FAN-WISE AS EACH IMPATIENT FEEDER FOLLOWED UP SOME VEIN OF ESPECIALLY LUSCIOUS HERBAGE
THE HARE OF COURSE LIKE THE PTARMIGAN WAS AT THIS SEASON SNOWY-WHITE
NOT ONCE DID HE ALLOW HIMSELF TO LOOK BACK THOUGH TO HIS IMPATIENT WRATH HE FELT SURE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LANE THAT MALEVOLENT EYES WERE WATCHING HIM THROUGH THE FENCE
THESE THREE PAIRS OF EAGLES HAD THEIR NESTS IN THE UPPERMOST AND MOST INACCESSIBLE LEDGES OF BALD FACE
THEN IT CHANCED WHEN BLUE FOX WAS CHASING A HARE OVER THE SNOW BENEATH THE GREEN ROSE AND VIOLET DANCING FLAMES OF THE AURORA THAT A THIN QUAVERING HOWL CAME TO HIS EARS
THROUGH A LONG LONG MOMENT OF HORROR SHE LAY FLAT ON HER FACE EXPECTING A GIGANTIC PAW TO FALL UPON HER NECK AS A CAT'S PAW FALLS UPON A MOUSE
STAGGERING FROM HIS WOUNDS AND OVERWHELMED WITH A SUDDEN TERROR OF ISOLATION HE TRIED TO EDGE HIS WAY INTO THE HERD NEXT BEHIND HIM
ARRIVING AT THE CABIN JACKSON GOT OUT HIS KNIFE AND WAS FOR SETTING TO WORK AT ONCE ON THE SKINNING AND CUTTING UP
HITHERTO IT HAD BEEN THE WONT OF THE COLOSSAL HORDES TO DEAL WITH THEIR ADVERSARIES IN A VERY DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION--TO CHARGE AND THUNDER DOWN UPON THEM TO ROLL OVER THEM IN AN IRRESISTIBLE FLOOD OF ANGRY HOOVES AND TRAMPLE THEM OUT OF EXISTENCE
HE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE GIANT FORM OF THE GRIZZLY BURST FROM THE UNDERBRUSH AND COME LUNGING ACROSS THE STRIP OF OPEN
BUT NOW IF MAN WERE ABLE TO RIDE THE DWELLERS OF THE AIR THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPING HIS TYRANNY
FOR THE ACCUSTOMED PERILS OF THE MARCH HE ENTERTAINED JUST SO MUCH DREAD AS BEFITTED A SAGACIOUS LEADER--NO MORE
SHE COULD ALMOST AFFORD TO LAUGH IN HER SATISFACTION AS SHE GROPED HER WAY BACK TO HER SEAT
BUT THERE WAS ONE WILD FISHERMAN WHOM THE POOL SUITED EXACTLY
THERE WAS NO RIG TO BE HAD FOR LOVE OR MONEY
NEW YORK THE MACMILLAN COMPANY 1917 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED COPYRIGHT 1913 BY THE ILLUSTRATED SUNDAY MAGAZINE AND BY THE COSMOPOLITAN MAGAZINE
IT WAS A GREAT ARCTIC HAWK-OWL WHITE MOTTLED WITH CHOCOLATE
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT STROVE DESPERATELY TO INTERPRET THAT GRAVE MEANING
BUT THIS FACT TO THE OTTER WAS OF NO ACCOUNT WHATEVER
HIS FLIES AS BEFITTED THESE AMBER-BROWN TUMULTUOUS NORTHERN STREAMS WERE LARGE AND CONSPICUOUS--A PARMACHEENIE BELLE FOR THE TAIL FLY WITH A MONTREAL AND A RED HACKLE FOR THE DROPS
THE LATTER WAS ONE OF THOSE MOROSE OLD MALES WHO HAVING FORGOTTEN OR OUTGROWN THE COMFORTABLE CUSTOM OF HIBERNATION ARE DOOMED TO RANGE THE WILDERNESS ALL WINTER
IN THE CONTINUAL FLIGHT UP AND DOWNSTREAM THEIR KEEN EYES WERE WONT TO SEARCH THE POOL ENVIOUSLY
THEN HE STOPPED SHORT
FINDING THAT THERE WAS NO RESISTANCE LEFT IN THE BEANS THE SUGAR OR THE BAG OF FLOUR HE WENT AFTER THE LITTLE SCARLET TIN OF PEPPER WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN SOME DISTANCE AND LAY UNDER A NEIGHBORING TREE
TOUCHING UP THE EDGE OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE ON THE SOLE OF HIS LARRIGAN HE SKINNED THE BEAR DEFTLY ROLLED UP THE HEAVY PELT AND TIED IT WITH OSIER-WITHES FOR CONVENIENCE IN THE LUGGING
IT WAS NO GOOSE OR BRANT OR FISH-LOVING MERGANSER OR INLAND WANDERING SADDLEBACK GULL THAT FLEW IN SUCH A FASHION
THE WOLVES DISCOVERED BY CHANCE ONE OF THE SUPPLY CELLARS AND QUARRELED FOR A MOMENT OVER THE DOZEN OR SO OF TIT-BITS WHICH IT CONTAINED
SEEMS TO THINK HE'S A KIND OF A DAWG MUTTERED THE COOK THOUGHTFULLY
PRESENTLY BRANNIGAN SPOKE
HE RESOLVED TO GET OUT ALL HIS TRAPS AND SNARES AT ONCE AND SETTLE SCORES WITH THE BEAST WITHOUT DELAY
HIS SEAT WAS FURTHEST FROM THE DOOR
THIS CRITTER'S IN MY STABLES AN I COULD JEST TAKE HER SEEIN AS MY HANDS NEEDS HER WITHOUT NO TALK O PAYIN FER THE PRIVILEGE
THEY RANGED RESTLESSLY NOW OVER THE MUD REACHES NOW OVER THE SAND AND ROCKS WHEREVER QUARRY LARGE OR SMALL MIGHT PERHAPS BE ENCOUNTERED
AT FIRST BOTH WOODSMEN HAD TOILED LIKE DEMONS DASHING THE SNOW IN ARMFULS UPON THE BLAZING CAMP
THEN RECOVERING THE USE OF HIS WITS HE FELL BACKWARD OFF HIS BRANCH WITH A PROTESTING SQUEAK AND FLUTTERED OUT FROM THE BUSH THAT HELD SUCH HORRORS
TO HATCH THESE EXPEDITIONS SOMETIMES PROVED UNEVENTFUL FOR SOMETIMES THE HOSTILE SHADOWS SEEMED TO BE OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE AND TOO OCCUPIED TO FOLLOW HATCH'S TRAIL
HE SAT UP IN HIS BUNK
COW-MOOSE COMES HIGH IN NEW BRUNSWICK MR CLANCY SAID HE PLEASANTLY AS YE MUST A BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT ANSWERED THE BOSS
ALL THE INTERMINABLE DAY THEY PUSHED ON STOICALLY THROUGH THE SOFT IMPLACABLE SNOW-DEPTHS BUT STOPPING EVER MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY TO REST AS THE COLD AND THE TOIL TOGETHER DEVOURED THEIR FORCES
HE HAD BEEN BUT A FEW MOMENTS SETTLED IN HIS AMBUSH WHEN A FAT SLY-FACED WATER-RAT CAME AMBLING INTO THE WRECK AT THE OTHER END OF THE KEEL NOSING THIS WAY AND THAT AMONG THE DEBRIS FOR SLEEPY BEETLES
JINNY WAS NATIVELY A GOOD MOTHER
FEW WRITERS EXHIBIT SUCH ENTIRE SYMPATHY WITH THE NATURE OF BEASTS AND BIRDS AS HE."--_BOSTON HERALD WHEN PLACED BY THE SIDE OF THE POPULAR NOVEL THE STRENGTH OF THESE STORIES CAUSES THEM TO STAND OUT LIKE A HUGE PRIMITIVE GIANT BY THE SIDE OF A SIMPERING SOCIETY MISS AND WHILE THE GRACE AND BEAUTY OF THE GIRL MAY PLEASE THE EYE FOR A MOMENT IT IS TO THE RUGGED STRENGTH OF THE PRIMITIVE MAN YOUR EYES WILL TURN TO GLORY IN HIS POWER AND SIMPLICITY
THE GREEN SUMMER WOODS SEEMED ONCE MORE TO JOHN HATCH THE OLD FRIENDLY WOODS WITH NEITHER MENACE NOR MYSTERY TO HIS RATHER UNIMAGINATIVE SPIRIT
THE NOISE OF THE OLD SORREL'S FLIGHT DIED AWAY DOWN THE WHITE WOOD ROAD AND FOR SEVERAL MINUTES NOTHING STIRRED
AT THE SAME TIME WITH SOMETHING MORE NEAR COLD TERROR THAN HE HAD EVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED HE SAW THE DARK BULK OF THE GRIZZLY WALLOWING DOWN UPON HIM HUGE AS A MOUNTAIN
THEN ALL AT ONCE HER FACE STIFFENED AND SHE SAT RIGID CLUTCHING THE EDGE OF THE BENCH WITH BOTH HANDS
FLYING LOW OVER THE GRASS-TOPS AND IGNORING THE HUSHED RUSTLE OF UNSEEN SCURRIERS BENEATH HE WINNOWED DOWN THE SHORE TO THE SWAMP AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEART OF THE LEAFIEST THICKET
FORGETTING THE VIOLETS THE GREENING BIRCHES THE DELICATE SPRING SMELLS SHE HURRIED ON AT A RECKLESS PACE WHICH SOON FORCED HER TO STOP AND RECOVER HER BREATH
THEY SUPPLIED HUNTING-GROUND THEREFORE FOR NOT ONLY A NUMBER OF FISH-HAWKS BUT ALSO FOR NO LESS THAN THREE PAIRS OF THE FISH-HAWKS DREADED TYRANTS THE WHITE-HEADED EAGLES
A CHANCE BLOW OF ONE OF HER POUNDING WINGS DROVE THE LID--THE BASKET BEING STILL ON ITS SIDE--COMPLETELY TO
AND THE FIERY LIGHT IN HIS BRAIN WENT OUT BUT JUST AFTER SUNSET WHEN THE GLOW HAD FADED AND THE FIRST THIN WAVE OF LILAC AND AMBER CAME WASHING COOLLY OVER THE WIDE LANDSCAPE AND THE BLOSSOMS GAVE OUT NEW SCENTS AT THE TOUCH OF THE DEW AND THE NIGHT-HAWKS TWANGED IN THE PALE GREEN UPPER HEAVEN THEN THE GRAY VISITOR AWOKE TO EAGER ACTIVITY
ALL THIS HE SAW AT ONE THOUGHT IN THE FRACTION OF A FLASH
THE DRY BARK CURLED CRACKED CAUGHT
SO THEY SOON GAVE UP THE PLAN AND LET HER TAKE HER PLACE IN THE REAR WHICH HER HUMILITY SEEMED TO DEMAND
THE FOX WRINKLED HIS NOSE WITH MINGLED REGRET AND DISDAIN
TO HIS ANXIOUS INDIGNATION HE SAW THE RIFLE STRIKE A BRANCH AND BOUNCE PERVERSELY A DOZEN FEET AWAY
SOMEWHAT PUZZLED JABE SMITH WENT AND LOOKED INTO THE BOX
AN OLD BULL HAD JUST BEEN DRIVEN OUT FROM A NEIGHBORING HERD DEPOSED FROM HIS LORDSHIP AND HIDEOUSLY GORED BY A YOUNGER AND STRONGER RIVAL
BUT TO WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT THE GREAT WHITE BEAST WAS NO MORTAL WOLF AND HE FEARED TO AFFRONT HIM BY THE OFFER OF WHITE MAN'S FOOD
BUT HAPPY AS HE WAS IN THE MAIN BLUE FOX WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS CARES
MARY HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME HANKERING AFTER A CHANCE TO REST HER LONG LEGS AND CHEW HER CUD SO SHE WAS IN NO WAY LOATH
THE FIRST COW WAS MILKED AND HAD WANDERED OFF TO FEED AND HATCH WAS ALMOST THROUGH WITH THE SECOND WHEN THROUGH THE BARS HE SAW THE DOG GET UP QUICKLY AND GO TROTTING OFF HOMEWARD WITH AN AIR OF HAVING BEEN KICKED
HE KNEW THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS SAFE BUT WHEN THE NIGHT CAME IT WOULD BE ANOTHER MATTER
BUT I AIN'T A-GOIN TO HAVE EM AG'IN
SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER A FUSSY RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD CAME BUSTLING INTO THE THICKET PERHAPS TO HUNT FOR DROWSY NIGHT-MOTHS ASLEEP ON THE UNDER SIDES OF THE TWIGS
ALONG DIZZY LEDGES THAT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A TRACK FOR LIZARDS OR A CLINGING PLACE FOR SWALLOWS HE LED THE WAY WITHOUT PAUSE OR HESITATION THE FLOCK IN SINGLE FILE AT HIS HEELS
THE HERON'S HEAD DARTED DOWNWARD AT HIM AS IF SPEARING A FROG
AND THE DANCING LIGHTS SHIFTING FROM COLOR TO COLOR AS THEY CLUSTERED AND HURTLED ACROSS THE ARCH OF SKY SEEMED TO STOOP IN COLD LAUGHTER OVER HIS LONELY AND DESPERATE FLIGHT
WHEN HE SAW JOHN HATCH STOP ABRUPTLY GLARE ABOUT HIM AND PLUNGE INTO THE UNDERBUSH THEN JEFF WOULD TRY TO GET BETWEEN HIS LEGS AN EFFORT NOT HELPFUL TO HATCH'S MARKSMANSHIP OR TO HIS TEMPER
AT THE HEELS OF THE MORE NIMBLE JINNY HE WOULD BE CHASED IN IGNOMINY FROM THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH MRS JABE'S ANGRY BROOM THWACKING AT THE SPOT WHERE NATURE HAD FORGOTTEN TO GIVE HIM A TAIL
ANOTHER SPAT TOBACCO JUICE INTO THE SNOW IN A SORT OF RESIGNED DERISION
A GREAT HUBBUB OF STARTLED AND SCREAMING WATER-FOWL PURSUED THE MARAUDER
HE SAW THE BASKET LYING ON THE GROUND AND THE ANGRY OWL CLAWING AT IT
THE LYNX MOVED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A HALF HOUR
TO THE WATCHERS IN THE SHADOW HOWEVER THIS LOOKED LIKE A RETREAT
EF WE DON'T MAKE CONROY'S CAMP PURTY SOON WE'LL HEV TO--WELL IT'LL BE UP TO MARY
THE ARROGANCE OF IRRESISTIBLE MIGHT HAD PASSED FROM THEM
THE PIG BEING AN INCURABLE SCEPTIC BY NATURE AND MOREOVER POSSESSED OF A KEEN AND DISCRIMINATING NOSE PERSISTED IN BELIEVING HIM TO BE A BEAR AND A LOVER OF PORK AND WOULD SQUEAL NERVOUSLY AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
THANK YOU KINDLY MR B'AR HE MUTTERED
THE SIGHT DID NOT INTEREST HIM BUT AS IT COVERED THE WHOLE PLAIN BEHIND HIM HE COULD NOT ESCAPE IT IF HE LOOKED BACK
SHE VENTURED TO RAISE HER HEAD
PRESENTLY HE CROUCHED AND CREPT FORWARD LIKE A CAT
A MOMENT MORE AND HE BEGAN TO CREEP SLOWLY FORWARD VERY SLOWLY INCH BY INCH
THE DREADFUL WAITING HORDES HAD ALL VANISHED FROM THE SKIRTS OF THE TIMBER WHIRLING OFF DOUBTLESS ON THE TRAIL OF SOME UNPROHIBITED QUARRY
AT FIRST TO BE SURE THIS GAVE HIM A GUILTY CONSCIENCE AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD GLANCE UP NERVOUSLY AS IF APPREHENDING THE BROOM
SATISFIED AT LENGTH THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER WITHIN RANGE THE MINK GLIDED UP TO THE WAGON
CONVINCING HIMSELF AT LAST THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE GLARED ABOUT HIM WRATHFULLY TILL HIS EYES FELL ON MCLAGGAN'S PACK LYING NEAR BY
IN KNOTS OF THREE AND FOUR THEY STATIONED THEMSELVES ON THEIR PONIES DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF THE ADVANCING HOST
A GREAT BOOK FOR BOYS OF ALL AGES AND ONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ONLY BY CHARLES G
HE ALIGHTED ON A BRANCH ABOUT TWO FEET FROM THE GRAY VISITOR'S HEAD AND STARED IMPERTINENTLY AT THE SPECTRAL MOTIONLESS SHAPE
SHE FELL HEADLONG AND THE PIPE FLEW HALF-WAY ACROSS THE FLOOR CLATTERING OVER ITS FELLOWS AS IT WENT AND RAISING A PRODIGIOUS NOISE
JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE MERE IT DROPPED SUDDENLY INTO A PATCH OF REEDS TO FLAP UP AGAIN A SECOND LATER WITH A LIMP FORM TRAILING FROM ITS TALONS--THE FORM OF A LUCKLESS MOTHER-DUCK SURPRISED IN BROODING HER EGGS
THE CABIN DOOR WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE COUNTY LINE ROAD THOUGH IN WINTER A HIGHWAY OF SOME IMPORTANCE FOR THE SLEDS AND SLEIGHS OF THE LUMBERMEN WAS IN SUMMER LITTLE MORE THAN A BROAD STRAIGHT TRAIL WITH GRASS AND WILD FLOWERS GROWING UNDISTURBED BETWEEN THE RUTS
GEE MUTTERED ALLEN
FOR NEARLY TWO DAYS AFTER THE REMAINS HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED--SAVE FOR HORNS AND HOOFS AND SUCH BONES AS HIS JAWS COULD NOT CRUSH--HE LINGERED
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT SUCH AN AWFUL SOUND SHOULD COME FROM THOSE UNMOVING WINGS
HIS SINEWS STIFFENED THEMSELVES IN TENSE READINESS
AND THEY WERE RISING FREELY TO ALMOST ANY BRIGHT FLY THOUGH WITH A PREFERENCE FOR A RED HACKLE
THE BOTTOM MOREOVER OFFERED A JUDICIOUS VARIETY OF ATTRACTION
CALMLY HE PROCEEDED TO CHOP HIS WOOD INTO SMALL BILLETS FOR THE MORE FRUGAL USE
JABE SMITH AS HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT WAS A MAN OF SYMPATHETIC DISCERNMENT
AN IT WOULDN'T BE DECENT TO GO CUTTIN UP HER MA RIGHT AFORE HER EYES
THERE WAS NOTHING BEHIND HIM ON THE TRAIL--AT LEAST WITHIN A HALF-MILE OF HIM
PERCEIVING THAT HIS VICTIM WAS A MOTHER AND ALSO THAT HER FUR WAS RUSTY AND RAGGED AFTER THE WINTER'S SLEEP SENTIMENT AND THE SOUND UTILITARIANISM OF THE BACKWOODS STIRRED WITHIN HIM IN A FINE BLEND
BUT NATURE IS APT TO DEAL REMORSELESSLY WITH THE UNPREPARED
THEY PRESENTLY CONCLUDED THAT HERE AT LAST WAS THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WAITING FOR
Y
AND SHE COULD NOT KEEP HER EYES FOR MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS FROM THE BALEFUL FASCINATION OF THE WINDOW-SQUARES
HE FOUND THE WOLVERINE HEAD DOWNWARD IN HIS CHOICEST CELLAR
THE NESTING JUNCOS AND SNOW-BUNTINGS TWITTERED CHEERFULLY AMONG THE BUSY GROWTHS
III IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE AUTUMN OF HIS THIRD YEAR THAT WOOF BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE ANY DISCONTENT
EDGING IN AMONG THE TRUNKS BESIDE THE TRAIL TO BE THE BETTER HIDDEN HE CREPT FORWARD WITH REDOUBLED CAUTION
HE PRANCED OVER AND SLASHED AT IT IN SPITE OF MCLAGGAN'S APPEALS AND OPENED A GENEROUS GASH THROUGH WHICH THE AMBER-BROWN STICKINESS CAME BULGING FORTH PHLEGMATICALLY
BUT ALREADY HE RECOVERS SO WE WILL GO BACK TO THE MICHIKAMAW WITH THE FOOD GOOD SAID WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT
YOU WAIT TILL I GIT HER TIED UP ROUND BEHIND THE CAMP
HE WANTED NO ELK-MEAT WHICH TASTED LIKE THAT
THEN HE KNEW THAT HE WAS BEING TRAILED BY MANY WOLVES
THE GIRL SLIPPED AROUND THE STOVE
THEN THEY REMEMBERED THAT THE MIGRATING HERDS WERE ANXIOUSLY AWAITED BY OTHER TRIBES OF INDIANS FURTHER SOUTH WHO LARGELY DEPENDED UPON THE BISON FOR THEIR LIVING
HE HALTED TO TAKE IT IN THOROUGHLY
IT LIT
LET US CALL HIM WHITE WOLF SINCE HE IS OF THE TOTEM OF THE WOLF
AND THE DREAD BLACK SHADOW WOULD FADE AWAY INTO THE GLOOM
LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP-FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
TOO ANXIOUS TO WAIT AND CONFIDENT IN HER YOUNG VIGOR SHE HAD LEFT HER LUGGAGE TIED UP A FEW NECESSARIES AND EATABLES IN A HANDY BUNDLE AND SET OUT BY THE SHORT CUT OF THE OLD LINE ROAD
BUT IT WAS NOT AT THE SILENT WATCHER ON THE TREE-ROOT ACROSS THE POOL THAT THE OTHER WAS LOOKING
THEY WERE SO YOUNG THAT THEIR EYES WERE NOT YET OPEN AND THEY LAY HUDDLED COSILY AND TRUSTINGLY TOGETHER IN THEIR BED OF BROWN LEAVES LIKE SO MANY EXAGGERATED KITTENS OF THE HEARTHSIDE TABBY
MCLAGGAN STARED AFTER THEM IN SURPRISE WONDERING AT THEIR ABRUPT FLIGHT
AT FIRST THOUGHT THE IDEA WAS SO AUDACIOUS SO STARTLING SO FANTASTIC THAT SHE SHRANK FROM IT AS ABSURD
HE SLASHED IT OPEN WITH A STROKE OF THE HOOF THEN JABBED IT WITH A PRONG OF HIS ANTLERS AND FLUNG IT INTO THE AIR
AS IT LANDED HE WAS UPON IT AGAIN THIS TIME WITH THE AXE AND A STRAIGHT SHORT-ARM BLOW ENDED THE MATTER
THE BREATH BELCHED OUT OF HIS ASTONISHED LUNGS WITH A LOUD COUGHING GRUNT AND THE RAM WENT OVER HIM SPURNING HIM WITH SHARP HOOFS
HE FOUND IT BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH IN ITS CRYSTAL-CLEAR AUSTERITY
BUT IF CONTENT WITH HIS EXPLORATIONS HE WAS FAR FROM CONTENT ON THE SCORE OF HIS ADVENTURE WITH THE EAGLES
MACCREEDY SAW A VICIOUS GRANITE RIDGE WHISKERED WITH FIR TREES LURCH UP AT HIM INSANELY FROM A THOUSAND FEET BELOW
BUT HE SEEMED TO SEE OR IMAGINED HE SAW A FLITTING SHADOW--WHETHER DARKER OR LIGHTER THAN ITS SURROUNDINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD--FADE INTO THE OBSCURITY AROUND IT
IN THEIR PLACE EMERGING LIKE MISTS FROM THE FOREST AND TAKING FORM IN THE FIRELIGHT CAME THE SPIRITS OF THE TOTEMS OF HIS ANCESTORS--WHITE BEARS AND BLACK WITH EYES OF MEN EAGLES THAT WALKED STRIDINGLY GRAY LYNXES WITH A STARE THAT SEEMED TO PIERCE HIM THROUGH THE BONE AND TOWERING BLACK MOOSE BULLS WITH THE STORM-DRIFT WHIRLING IN THEIR ANTLERS
IT DREW NEAR AT FRIGHTFUL SPEED SPINNING AS IT CAME AND LICKING UP THE SURFACE OF THE PLAIN BENEATH
YET A RUMOR HAD COME TO HIM SOMEHOW THAT THE INSIGNIFICANT CREATURE WAS NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH
WHEN THE DAYS WERE SHRUNKEN TO AN HOUR OR TWO OF SUNLIGHT AND THE TUNDRA WAS FROZEN TO STONE AND THE WINDS DROVE THE FINE SNOW BEFORE THEM IN BLINDING DRIFTS THEN BLUE FOX DISMISSED HIS STORES FROM HIS MIND AND DEVOTED HIMSELF MERRILY TO THE HUNTING OF HIS DAILY RATIONS
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT SHE TOO WAS A DOG
ACCORDING TO THE SILENT CALCULATION OF EACH THE CAMP WAS STILL SO FAR AHEAD THAT THE ODDS WERE ALL AGAINST THEIR GAINING IT
POOR MARY
HE SAT MOTIONLESS AS BEFORE BUT NOW WITH ALL HIS SENSES ON THE ALERT
HE MIGHT HAVE FEASTED TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND INCURRED NO PENALTY MORE SERIOUS THAN THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE TETHERED HORSE HAD HE NOT BEEN QUITE SO AMAZINGLY CLEVER
THEY INCLUDED AMONG OTHER ITEMS A TWO-GALLON TIN OF MOLASSES A LITTLE TIN OF PEPPER ENVELOPED IN A FLARING SCARLET LABEL A WHITE COTTON BAG OF FLOUR A PAPER BAG OF BEANS AND ANOTHER OF SUGAR
WHAT YE DOIN HERE SONNY
THE DUSK BEGAN TO GATHER AMONG THE WHITE-SHROUDED FIR THICKETS
REACH ME A BUNCH O THEM BIRCH TWIGS O MARY'S HE SAID
AND WOOF PLACATED BY HIS VICTORY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW
AND THEREFORE WITH HIS WARINESS HIS UNERRING NOSE AND HIS MARVELOUS LIGHTNESS OF TREAD HE WAS SOMETIMES ABLE TO SURPRISE THE SWIFT HARE ASLEEP
THEY UNDERMINED PETE ALLEN'S FOOTING
SEATING HIMSELF WITH HIS BACK TO THE LOADED TOBOGGAN HE PREPARED HIS SUPPER
HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL IN DEEP DISGUST AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF ANOTHER SHADOWY SHAPE FLICKERING OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
BUT MORE FUEL OF SOME SORT WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT KNEW HE MUST HAVE
OR RATHER INSTEAD OF LEADING THEM HE SHEPHERDED THEM BEFORE HIM KEEPING THEM ALL UNDER HIS EYE AND HIMSELF GUARDING THE REAR WHILE THE OLDEST AND WARIEST OF THE EWES PRICK-EARED AND ALL A-QUIVER WITH SUSPICION LED THE WAY QUESTIONING EVERY BUSH AND EVERY SHADOW
IT WAS JUST AT THIS POINT IN THE MINK'S ADVENTURE THAT THE FOX RETURNED TO THE CLEARING
AT LAST HE OPENED HIS IMMENSE ROUND YELLOW EYES--DISCS OF FLAMING YELLOW GLASS WITH THE PUPILS CONTRACTED TO MERE PINHEADS IN THE GLARE OF THE UNSHADOWED LIGHT
OH MIKE SHE EXCLAIMED CRYING AND LAUGHING ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND CLUTCHING HIM BY THE ARM I HAD TO DO IT
AS IT FELL THE GIRL SCRATCHED THE MATCH AND SET IT TO THE DRY STUFF
WE'LL NEED EM WORSE LATER ON THEN WE'LL HAVE TO WARM OURSELVES HUGGIN MARY LAUGHED BRANNIGAN
NET MORE WONDERFUL ANIMAL TALES SUCH AS ONLY MR ROBERTS CAN RELATE
AS HE DID SO THAT UNKNOWN AND QUITE INCALCULABLE SENSE WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE ITS SEAT IN THE FINE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF ONE'S NECK AND IN THE SKIN OF THE CHEEKS COMMANDED HIM TO TURN HIS HEAD
BUT BEING HALF-BLINDED HE FELL SHORT AND ONLY GOT A GRIP WITH HIS FRONT CLAWS
LIKE ALL HIS ARISTOCRATIC BREED HE HAD A CERTAIN PUNCTILIO TO OBSERVE IN SUCH AFFAIRS
AT THE REAR OF THE CABIN WOOF MADE OUT A LARGE ROUND STARTLED FACE FRINGED WITH SCANTY RED WHISKERS AND A MOP OF RED HAIR STARING AT HIM FROM OVER THE EDGE OF AN UPPER BUNK
A FEW MINUTES LATER AT AN UNPROVOCATIVE HEIGHT HE SWEPT AROUND AND HEADED FOR HOME
HE WAS PEERING DOWN WITH EXULTANT EYES INTO THE PEOPLED DEPTHS
IT CIRCLED THE WAGON A COUPLE OF TIMES IN A NERVOUS JERKY RUN ITS HEAD DARTING THIS WAY AND THAT TILL ITS NOSE ASSURED IT BEYOND QUESTION THAT THE FISH IT SCENTED WERE IN THE WAGON ITSELF
THEIR HESITATION VANISHED
THEY CLUNG TO THE HOST FOR SOME HOURS THROWING THE OUTER FRINGE OF IT INTO CONFUSION BUT ATTRACTING LITTLE ATTENTION FROM THE HERDS BEYOND THEIR REACH
AND THEN FRANTIC AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING CUT OFF FROM THE FLOCK SHE WHEELED AGAIN AND TRIED TO DODGE PAST HER ASSAILANT
A SHAGGY AND SLY OLD SILVER-TIP AS IT CHANCED HAD HAD HIS EYE FOR SOME TIME ON THAT FLOCK
THEN HER EYES AFLAME WITH RAGE AND FEAR SHE BETOOK HERSELF ONCE MORE TO THE ENTRANCE AND CROUCHED THERE MOTIONLESS TO AWAIT THE COMING OF THE ENEMY
HE SNORTED FRESH DEFIANCE THROUGH WIDE RED NOSTRILS NICELY FRINGED WITH WHITE
THE RADIUS OF HIS MENACING PROWL GREW GRADUALLY WIDER
BUT HE KNEW SOMETHING ELSE WHICH HE COULD ONLY HAVE ARRIVED AT BY THE STRICTLY RATIONAL PROCESS OF PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER--HE UNDERSTOOD THE EFFICACY OF COLD STORAGE
YE WOULDN'T BE WORTH COMIN BACK FER JACKSON CHUCKLED FEEBLY AND DROPPED THE SUBJECT KNOWING HE WAS A FOOL TO HAVE RAISED IT
AND THE WOLF-PACK WAS HUNTING HIM
I WAS TAKING HIM TO NORTH WEST RIVER TO BE CURED BY THE WHITE MAN'S MEDICINE
BUT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT IN THE SITUATION WHICH HAD HE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE INTERFERED WITH ALLEN'S CONCENTRATION OF PURPOSE
FROM THE SPOT AT WHICH THE TROUT HAD SO SURPRISINGLY VANISHED UP SHOT THE HEAD OF THE OTTER
WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT GAVE ONE LONG LOOK AT HIS STRANGE PROTECTOR THEN CALMLY TURNED AND STRODE BACK TO HIS FIRE
AND MARY THOUGH SHE HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING IT WAS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MOST COMFORTABLE AND CONTENTED YOUNG MOOSE IN ALL EASTERN CANADA
NO LIVING THING WAS TO BE SEEN EXCEPT A LITTLE BLACK-AND-WHITE WOODPECKER WHICH SLIPPED BEHIND A HEMLOCK TRUNK AND PEERED AROUND AT HIM WITH BRIGHT INQUIRING EYES
IT PASSED STRAIGHT OVER HIS HEAD ITS TERRIBLE HOOKED BEAK HALF OPEN ITS WIDE IMPLACABLE EYES JEWEL-BRIGHT AND HARD AS GLASS GLARING DOWNWARD WITH STILL MENACE
HIS TEMPER DID NOT IMPROVE UNDER THE STRAIN AND HIS LITTLE TROOP OF FOLLOWERS WAS HERDED WITH A SEVERITY WHICH MUST HAVE TAXED FOR THE MOMENT THEIR FAITH IN ITS BENEFICENCE
AND THE SEPARATE HERDS HUNG CLOSER TO THEIR NEIGHBORS THAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN THE CUSTOM IN THE HORDE AS IF SEEKING REASSURANCE AGAINST AN UNKNOWN THREAT
HE KNEW THERE WAS NO WILD BEAST NOT EVEN THE BIGGEST BEAR BETWEEN OLD SUGAR LOAF AND THE MIRAMICHI THAT WOULD BE SO RASH AS TO SEEK A QUARREL WITH HIM
AFTER THIS RESPITE A THOUSAND FANTASTIC SCHEMES OF DEFENSE BEGAN TO CHASE THEMSELVES THROUGH HER BRAIN
HE LOWERED HIS GUN AND RUBBED HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY FEELING EVEN HIS OLD LUMBER-CAMP VOCABULARY INADEQUATE
SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH TRAPS HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS ONE
MOST A PITY I HAD TO SHOOT HER JEST NOW WHEN SHE'S OUT O SEASON AN HER PELT NOT WORTH THE JOB OF STRIPPIN IT ENTERING THE HALF DARKNESS OF THE CAVE HE QUICKLY DISCOVERED THE CUB IN ITS INEFFECTUAL HIDING-PLACE
THE OTHER LYNX WHICH WAS RECOVERING FROM ITS CONTACT WITH THE TREE SAW THAT ITS MATE WAS SLAIN AND SPED OFF AMONG THE TREES JUST ESCAPING THE AXE WHICH HATCH HURLED AFTER IT
THEN HE FILLED IT IN RIGHT TO THE TOP WITH GRASS ROOTS TURF AND OTHER DRY STUFF THAT WOULD NOT FREEZE INTO ARMOR-PLATE COVERED IT OVER WITH LIGHT SOIL AND BUSHES AND LEFT IT TO AWAIT THE HOUR OF NEED
IT WAS A BAD WINTER
ONE OF THE GLIMMERING GRAY-BLUE SQUARES GREW SUDDENLY DARK
HIS TOWERING BULK AND SAVAGE RESOLUTE BEARING MADE THE NEAREST BULLS UNWILLING TO CHALLENGE HIS INTRUSION
AND ALL DAY THE BROWN MOTHER HAD MOPED WHIMPERING AND WHINING ABOUT THE STABLE CASTING LONG DISTRAUGHT GLANCES AT THE BOX IN THE CORNER WHICH SHE WAS UNWILLING EITHER TO APPROACH OR TO QUITE FORSAKE
BUT THEIR NUMBERS AND THE NEARNESS OF THEIR COMPANIONS SEEMED TO GIVE THEM A STOLID SENSE OF SECURITY EVEN WHEN THE SWIFT DEATH WAS ALMOST UPON THEM
THE BEAR BLAZING WITH VENGEANCE HAD NO EYES IN THAT MOMENT FOR SHEEP
THEN THE UPPER HINGE GAVE WAY AND THE DOOR LEANED INWARD ADMITTING A WIDE STREAK OF GLIMMER
FIRE THAT NIGHT THEY MUST HAVE
BUT AT THIS THE LYNX POUNCED IN ALSO WITH A STARTLING GROWL
WITH ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXILED BEASTS AND A VIVID IMAGINATION THE AUTHOR WRITES STORIES THAT ARE EVEN MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING
THEY SMOKED INCESSANTLY TO FOOL THEIR CRAVING STOMACHS TILL THEIR PIPES CHANCED TO GO OUT AT THE SAME TIME
AT LAST HE GRUNTED I'M THE LAME DUCK O THIS HERE OUTFIT TOM
HARASSED OF LATE YEARS BY NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMIES THEIR HERDS HAD BEEN SO THINNED AND SCATTERED THAT EVEN TO THE HEAVY BRAINS OF THE FIERCER OLD BULLS A VAGUE IDEA OF CAUTION WAS BEGINNING TO PENETRATE
IT HARDLY EVEN CAUGHT HIS EYE STILL LESS HIS INTEREST
THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR MCLAGGAN'S WRATH
I'M OBLEEGED TO YE FOR LEAVIN ME THE AXE SAID HE
HE WAS LEANING NOW ON MARY'S SHOULDERS WITH A HEAVINESS WHICH THAT YOUNG PERSON BEGAN TO FIND IRKSOME
UPON MRS SMITH AND THE CATS WOOF'S DELUSION CAME TO HAVE SUCH EFFECT THAT THEY TOO REGARDED HIM AS A DOG
ON HIS WAY UP THE SLOPE HE PASSED A SMALL DEAD FIR TREE AND A STUNTED BIRCH BOTH OF WHICH HE HASTILY CHOPPED DOWN AND FLUNG ACROSS HIS TOBOGGAN FOR FIREWOOD
NOW IT CHANCED THAT AT JABE SMITH'S FARM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE HAD JUST BEEN A HUMBLE TRAGEDY
HER PITEOUS MOOINGS CAUGHT THE EAR OF A HUNGRY OLD HE-BEAR WHICH WAS HUNTING IN THE WOODS NEAR BY
CONFRONTED BY SUCH AN EMERGENCY THE NEW BRUNSWICKER FIRED ON THE INSTANT AND BEING QUITE SURE OF HIMSELF AND THE BEAR ABOVE HIM HE TOOK A DIFFICULT SHOT
WHEN HER MASTER RETURNED AND CAME AND LOOKED IN HESITATINGLY AT THE STABLE DOOR THE BROWN MOTHER SAW THE SMALL FURRY SHAPE IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
THE CLEAR YOUNG FLAME CLIMBED LITHELY THROUGH THE SHAVINGS AND TWIGS
AS HE FIRED HE FELL AND THE LONG SOFT-NOSED DEADLY BULLET INSTEAD OF PIERCING THE GRIZZLY'S SPINE MERELY SMASHED THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
THE SPOT WHERE ALL THIS HAPPENED WAS PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS BELOW THAT DEAD TREE UPON WHOSE OUTTHRUST NAKED BRANCH THE SPLENDID MERGANSER DRAKE WAS MAKING HIS MEAL
STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER NOT TWENTY FEET AWAY BLACK AND HUGE AGAINST THE GRAY GLIMMER OF THE OPEN SHE HAD SEEN THE PROWLING BEAR
NOW THE NEED OF FUEL FOR THE INNER FIRE WAS DESTROYING HIM
AT SUCH TIMES DOUBTLESS HER INHERITED INSTINCTS HANKERED AFTER THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE TRODDEN MAZES OF THE MOOSE YARD BUT WHEN HER PARTNERS WERE AT HOME AND SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE CABIN WITH THEM SUCH FAINT STIRRINGS OF ANCESTRAL MEMORY WERE CLEAN FORGOTTEN
A FOREST FIRE SOME TEN DAYS BACK HAD SWEPT PAST THAT WAY CUTTING A MILE-WIDE SWATH THROUGH THE WOODS AND CLEAN WIPING OUT JABE SMITH'S LITTLE HOMESTEAD
THE POOL WAS HIS OWN PRIVATE PREEMPTION LONG HELD WITHOUT A CHALLENGE
THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE WOLF WAS AN OPEN PAGE TO HIM
HE HEARD HER SHRILL DESPAIRING BLEAT
HE SHALL BE CALLED WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT THE OLD SQUAW HER HUSBAND'S MOTHER WHO WAS ATTENDING UPON HER SHOOK HER HEAD
GUESS WE'D RATHER WAIT FOR THE BEEF AYE AYE CHIMED IN SEVERAL VOICES PACIFICALLY
AT THE SAME TIME THIS INOFFENSIVE AND DEFENSELESS-LOOKING CREATURE UNDOUBTEDLY BELONGED TO THE SPECIES MAN AS HIS NOSTRILS WELL ASSURED HIM
JABE SMITH'S DOG A LONG-HAIRED BROWN RETRIEVER HAD BEEN BEREAVED OF HER NEW-BORN PUPPIES
IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAR PAUSED EYEING SUSPICIOUSLY THE TINY BLUE SPURT OF THE STRUGGLING MATCH
WITH A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF HE STOPPED DRANK AT A BUBBLING ICY SPRING ATE HIS COLD BACON AND CRACKERS AND SMOKED A PIPE
VERY GRADUALLY THEY CREPT UP HALF EXPECTING THAT JOHN HATCH MIGHT SPRING TO HIS FEET ANY MOMENT AND RUSH AT THEM WITH A ROAR
BUT AT THE VERY FRACTION OF A SECOND WHEN HIS FINGER STARTED TO PULL THE TRIGGER THE WHIMSICAL FATES OF THE WILDERNESS TOOK A HAND IN THE GAME
WITH TENDER MOTHERING LIPS SHE LIFTED THEM FROM THE WATER BY THEIR NECKS CURLED HERSELF ABOUT THEM FOR WARMTH AND FELL TO LICKING THEM PASSIONATELY WITH SOFT MURMURS OF CARESS
FOR ALL HIS RAGE THE MINK KEPT HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
NO MORE UPON HIS TRAMPS ON SNOWSHOES THROUGH THE MUFFLED WOODS DID JOHN HATCH FEEL THOSE ADMONITORY CREEPINGS OF HIS FLESH AND PRESENTLY HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE HAUNTING SHADOWS AND THEIR MENACE
HE ROSE NOISILY INTO THE AIR MADE A DETOUR OVER THE TREE-TOPS TO AVOID THE FISHERMAN AND FLEW BACK TO HIS DEAD BRANCH OVERHANGING THE AMBER RUSH OF THE CHUTES
BUT THE LOADED SLEDGE WAS NOT BEFORE HIM AS A BARRIER
IN THE MEANTIME PETE ALLEN WEARY WITH CLIMBING SORE WITH DISAPPOINTMENT TORMENTED WITH AS MANY FLIES AS HIS OWN NEW BRUNSWICK BACKWOODS WOULD HAVE LET LOOSE UPON HIM AT THE WORST OF THE SEASON WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER IF THE HUNT OF THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP WAS AS SIMPLE AN AFFAIR AS HE HAD FANCIED IT
BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR THE SAP TO BE WORKING UP AND THE STUFF WAS NO MORE EATABLE THAN SAWDUST
THEREUPON THE LYNX CAME PROWLING BACK
THE BEAR A WILY BOXER PARRIED HER NEXT STROKE WITH A BLOW THAT BROKE HER LEG AT THE HOCK
AND SHE GREATLY FEARED TO MEET THE CHILD'S FATHER IF IT SHOULD DIE IN HIS ABSENCE
WITH A HARSH QUAH-AH OF DESPAIR THE HERON STROVE TO REGAIN HER POSITION FOR ANOTHER STROKE
BUT HE ROSE INSTEAD AND AS HE SAILED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY ACROSS THE ABYSS THE EAGLES CAME FLAPPING UP OVER THE RIM OF THE PLATEAU BEHIND
THEY YELPED INDIGNANTLY AT HIM AND FLEW OFF TO PERCH ON THEIR EYRIES AND BROOD OVER THE PROBLEM
WITH A SOFT SWISH A TINY AVALANCHE SLID DOWN FELL UPON THE FIRE AND BLOTTED IT OUT
IN FACT WOOF KNEW HER AS A YOUNG BEAST WHO HAD OFTEN SHAKEN HER BUDDING HORNS AT HIM
THE SHORE DROWSING UNDER THE JUNE SUN WAS AS FLAT AND SEEMINGLY AS LIMITLESS AS THE SEA EXCEPT TO THE RIGHT WHERE THE UNFENCED LEVELS OF THE GRASS FOAMED GOLDEN-GREEN ALONG THE FRINGE OF THE WOODED HILLS
HE SNATCHED UP THE TWO BIGGEST FISH IN HIS JAWS AND TROTTED OFF WITH THEM TO THE WOODS GLANCING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE WENT
THE FIGHT WAS OVER BUT MCLAGGAN PERCEIVED WITH A THRILL THAT THE FLIGHT WAS COMING HIS WAY
THEIR NERVES WERE RAW WITH ANGRY ANXIETY FOR THEIR NESTS
ONE STROKE OF HIS ARMED PAW ON THE UNHAPPY HEIFER'S NECK PUT A PERIOD TO HER PAINS AND THE SAVAGE OLD PROWLER FELL TO HIS MEAL
THEY COULD NOT MAKE OUT AT FIRST WHY THEIR ENEMY WHO WAS ALWAYS SO VEHEMENTLY ACTIVE SHOULD NOW BE LYING SO STILL THERE IN THE SNOW
THE BASKET IN THE WAGON WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THERE WAS NO TRAP TO BE FEARED
12MO 50C
IN HIS PRESENT BOOK ARE TALES OF THE BEAR THE BAT THE SEAL THE MOOSE RABBIT AND OTHER ANIMALS WRITTEN IN HIS USUAL VIVID STYLE
BUT THE ANTIC FOREST FATES WEARIED OF THE SIMPLE ROUTINE OF THE WILDERNESS HAD DECREED AN ALTOGETHER NOVEL INTERVENTION AND WERE GIGGLING IN THEIR CLOAKS OF ANCIENT MOSS
BUT ACROSS HIS MIND CAME AN INSISTENT MEMORY OF THE LONG AND BITTER ARCTIC NIGHT WHEN THE WORLD WOULD SEEM TO SNAP UNDER THE DEADLY INTENSITY OF THE COLD AND THERE WOULD BE NO BIRDS BUT A FEW PTARMIGAN IN THE SNOW AND THE FAT LEMMINGS WOULD BE SAFE BENEATH THE FROZEN ROOFS OF THEIR TUNNELS AND HIS CLEVEREST HUNTING WOULD HARDLY SERVE HIM TO KEEP THE KEEN EDGE OFF HIS HUNGER
BUT BROWN BULL CAUGHT THE LEADER'S PONY IN THE FLANK RIPPED IT AND BORE IT DOWN PASSING STRAIGHT ON OVER THE BODIES WHICH IN A DOZEN SECONDS WERE HARDLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE EARTH TO WHICH THEY HAD SO SUDDENLY AND SO AWFULLY BEEN RENDERED BACK
BUT HE WENT UNHAPPILY CROWDING AT HIS MASTER'S HEELS WITH HEAD AND EARS AND TAIL ONE UNANIMOUS PROTEST
BUT BROWN BULL SEEMED TO FEEL THAT HERE AND NOW STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WAS THE UNKNOWN PERIL WHICH HAD BEEN SHAKING HIS HEART THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LONG MARCH
THE MINK STUFFED HIMSELF TILL HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER MOUTHFUL DOWN
THE AUTUMN NIGHTS WERE CRISP WITH TONIC FROST AND IN THE PINK FRESHNESS OF THE DAWN A WIDE-FLUNG MIST AROSE FROM THE COUNTLESS PUFFING NOSTRILS AND THE FROST-RIMED STREAMING MANES
THE WINDOWS WERE SMALL--SO SMALL THAT SHE WAS SURE NO MONSTER SUCH AS THE ONE WHICH HAD JUST CONFRONTED HER COULD BY ANY POSSIBILITY FORCE ITS WAY THROUGH THEM
THEY HAVE SOME SENSE PERHAPS OF HAVING REGAINED A LOST DOMINION
A REMARK UNSUITABLE TO THE PRINTED PAGE EXPLODED UPON HIS LIPS AND HE SAW HIS LEADER SETTLE DELIBERATELY OVER THE LONG BEATING WINGS THE TAIL-FLY COILING ABOUT THEM LIKE A WHIP-LASH
WITH A CHORUS OF SNARLS THE DISAPPOINTED PACK BROUGHT UP ABRUPTLY CHECKING THEMSELVES BACK UPON THEIR HAUNCHES
AND BY THIS SELF-EFFACING ATTITUDE HE TRUSTED TO CONVINCE THE TOUCHY BIRDS THAT HE HAD NO WISH TO TRESPASS UPON THEIR DOMESTICITY
FAR ACROSS THE POOL WHERE AN EDDY SUCKED SULLENLY AT THE FROTH-PATCHES AS THEY SWUNG BY THE FISHERMAN HAD JUST HAD A HEAVY RISE
PETE ALLEN AT LAST HAD CAUGHT A CLEAR VIEW OF THE GREAT BROWN RAM STANDING AT GUARD NOT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
HE SPRANG OUT HAULED THE MACHINE BACK A DOZEN YARDS OR SO AND DREW THE LONGEST BREATH OF RELIEF THAT HAD BEEN FORCED FROM HIS LUNGS SINCE HIS FIRST VENTURES IN AEROPLANING
IT WOULD BE ILL WORK IF WE SHOULD LEAVE HIM TO BE EATEN BY FOXES UP A TREE MCLAGGAN STOPPED SHORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAIL AND PEERED SHARPLY INTO THE THICK UNDERGROWTH ON HIS RIGHT
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY PUSHING HIMSELF WITHOUT STINTING HIS OWN REPASTS OR CURTAILING HIS HOURS OF INDOLENCE OR OF PLAY BLUE FOX ATTENDED TO HIS PROBLEM OF SUPPLY SO EFFICIENTLY THAT IN THE COURSE OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS HE HAD PERHAPS TWO SCORE PLUMP CARCASSES LEMMINGS AND MICE LAID OUT IN THIS COLD STORAGE CELLAR OF HIS
HIM THE OTTER CHOSE OUT FOR HIS PRIZE
THE GRASPING CLAWS SUNK DEEP INTO HIS SHOULDERS
THE LYNX CHECKED HIS SPRING
THEN WITH THE OTHER HAND SHE WHIPPED OFF ONE SHOE AND STOCKING
THIS THROATY SYLLABLE HIS ONLY UTTERANCE BESIDES THE WHIMPER WHICH SIGNALLED THE FREQUENT DEMANDS OF HIS APPETITE CAME TO BE ACCEPTED AS HIS NAME
IN THE DEEP OF HIS SLEEP THE GRAY VISITOR HEARD SOME WARNING OF DANGER
THEN HE CAME ON AGAIN WITH MORE CONFIDENCE
THE FISH INHABITING THE DELECTABLE POOL WERE ALL BIG ONES EXCEPT FOR A FEW SCATTERED YOUNG FRY WHICH DWELT PRECARIOUSLY IN THE EXTREMEST SHALLOWS WHERE THE BIG ONES COULD NOT COME AT THEM
NOW NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN BRANNIGAN THAT IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW OF NEW BRUNSWICK TO SHOOT A MOOSE AT THIS SEASON OR A COW MOOSE AT ANY SEASON
HE WAS JUST BEGINNING INDEED TO STIFFEN HIS SINEWS INSTINCTIVELY FOR THE FINAL RUSH WHICH SHOULD AVENGE THE INTRUSION UPON HIS RANGE WHEN HE SAW THE MAN STOP ABRUPTLY AND RAISE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LONG BROWN STICK TO HIS SHOULDER
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT WORTH PICKING UP EXCEPT HIS AXE
SUDDENLY SOMETHING LIKE A FALLING BOULDER CRASHED INTO HIS RIBS CATCHING HIM WITH HIS FOREFEET OFF THE GROUND AND ALMOST ROLLING HIM OVER
CERTAIN IT WAS THAT THE BOY WAS WITHOUT FEAR TO GO ALONE IN THE FOREST AND WENT ALWAYS AS IF WITH A SENSE OF BEING SAFEGUARDED BY SOME UNSEEN INFLUENCE
HIS EDGED HOOFS SLASHED IT AND SMASHED IT HIS PRONGED ANTLERS RIPPED IT WIDE OPEN AND IN A DOZEN SECONDS HE HAD SENT THE CONTENTS FLYING IN EVERY DIRECTION
THE SHADOWS BEGAN TO FALL EARLY IN THAT LATITUDE
HE BROKE INTO A NOISELESS TROT HOPING YET TO BE IN TIME
THEY STOPPED PASTURING AND THE OLDER BULLS AND COWS SNIFFED THE DEAD AIR AS IF THEY DETECTED SOME STRANGE MENACE UPON IT
BUT AT ANY TIME OF CRISIS THERE WAS SURE TO BE SOME SUGGESTION OF HIM SOME REMINDER WHETHER IN A FAR-OFF WINDY HOWL THAT MIGHT BE WOLF OR MIGHT BE WIND OR ELSE IN A GAUNT WHITE SHADOW FLITTING HALF-SEEN ACROSS THE YOUTH'S TRAIL
HE LED HIS FOLLOWERS TRANQUILLY BACK TO THEIR PLACE ON THE KNOLL TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF PUZZLED SNORTINGS FROM THE NEIGHBOR HERDS
HE DARTED FORWARD ON TIP-TOE--NOISELESSLY AS HE THOUGHT--AND MADE A LONG LEAP AT THE FLAPPING DUSKY WINGS
WHEN HE WAS WELL WARMED HE WENT AND DRAGGED UP THE TREE WHICH HE HAD FELLED THEN HE COOKED HIMSELF A LIBERAL MEAL--A STRONG STEW OF PEMMICAN AND FLOUR--AND HAVING EATEN IT FELT MIGHTILY REFRESHED
AND SO WITH NOTHING TO MAR HIS CONTENT BUT THE OCCASIONAL PAROXYSMS OF MRS JABE'S BROOM WOOF LED THE SHELTERED LIFE AND WAS GLAD TO BE A DOG

THEN HE DIPPED INSTANTLY AND STRUCK DOWNWARD WITH HIS KNIFELIKE CLUTCHING TALONS
BUT NOTHING COULD EVER BRING THEM NEAR THE SURFACE SO HE KNEW NOTHING OF THEM BUT THAT THEY WERE FAT AND LOOKED VERY DESIRABLE
EVERY DAY OR TWO IN HIS DISTRESS HE WOULD REVISIT THE CLEARING AND WANDER SORROWFULLY AMONG THE SNOW-CLAD RUINS HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT HIS VANISHED FRIENDS WOULD PRESENTLY RETURN
BUT HE DID NOT FIRE FOR THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING TO FIRE AT
AS THE TROUT CAME SLANTING UP ON SCARLET FIN SHOULDERED THE SURFACE APART AND SUCKED DOWN THE MORSEL OUT FROM THE ROOT ABOVE HIM WOULD FLASH A WIDE-TALONED PAW UNERRING INESCAPABLE SCOOPING HIM FROM HIS ELEMENT AND IN HALF A SECOND HE WOULD BE FLOPPING CONVULSIVELY AMONG THE WINTERGREEN LEAVES FAR UP THE BANK
SUDDENLY HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE NOISE OF THE BLUNT-WINGED MONSTER'S FLIGHT
THE WOLVERINE SOLITARY AND MOROSE SLOW OF MOVEMENT AND DEFIANT EVEN TOWARD THE POLAR STORM PROWLED IN ALL WEATHERS
JUST AS IT WAS GROWING SO DARK THAT SHE FOUND IT HARD TO CHOOSE HER PATH BETWEEN THE POOLS AND THE BOG-HOLES TO HER INFINITE RELIEF SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CABIN ROOF CROWNING A LITTLE RISE OF GROUND BY THE ROADSIDE
RETURNING TO HER DEN AND FINDING HER LITTLE ONES GONE THE FOOTPRINTS AND THE TRAIL OF THE WOODSMAN HAD TOLD HER THE STORY
THEY AWOKE CHOKING FROM A NIGHTMARE
HIS HEAD WAS DRAWN BACK BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS BEHIND THE LONG YELLOW LANCE OF HIS BILL AND HIS EYES HARD AS JEWELS MET THOSE OF THE MURDERER WITHOUT ANY EXPRESSION OF RAGE OR FEAR OR HATE
THE GIRL RAN TO THE DOOR AND PEERED OUT
SHE SMILED SCORNFULLY THERE IN THE DARK KNOWING WELL THE STRENGTH OF THOSE LOG WALLS
HE SPAT DOWN UPON HIS ADVERSARY IN IMPOTENT INDIGNATION
WITH A SUDDEN BOUNCE HE SHOT INTO THE AIR TO COME DOWN AS HE CALCULATED SQUARE ON THE OTTER'S BACK
WHEN SHE COULD NO LONGER NURSE HIM HOWEVER SHE REMAINED HIS DEVOTED COMRADE PLAYMATE SATELLITE
THE EGGS CRUSHED IN THE STRUGGLE OOZED SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE LOOSE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PLATFORM AND THE GREAT GRAY OWL BEGAN TO TEAR GREEDILY AT THE MOST LAVISH BANQUET HIS HUNTING HAD EVER WON HIM
AS LONG AS THE ACTUAL WINTER HELD OFF THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THIS FORAGING
SWEATING HEAVILY AND ANGRILY BRUSHING THE FLIES FROM HIS EYES AND NOSE AND EARS HE MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH THE TRAIL FOR A COUPLE OF MILES ALONG THE DIFFICULT RAVINES BUT AT LAST AT THE ROOT OF A PRECIPICE WHICH IN HIS EASTERN JUDGMENT WAS QUITE IMPASSABLE TO ANYTHING WITHOUT WINGS HE LOST IT IRRETRIEVABLY
SHE BROKE INTO A RUN IN HER EAGERNESS REACHED THE DOOR AND POUNCED UPON IT BREATHLESSLY
OF CANADA LTD
AND THE WOLVERINE CUNNING BEYOND ALL THE OTHER KINDREDS OF THE WILD AND OF A SULLEN FEROCITY WHICH FEW WOULD DARE TO CROSS WAS FOREVER ON THE SEARCH FOR THE STORED SUPPLIES OF THE FOXES
WITH EARS LAID FLAT TO THE SKULL LIPS CURLED UP FROM HIS LONG WHITE TEETH AND HALF-OPEN EYES FLAMING GREEN HE GLARED AT THE SPRUCE THICKET WHENCE THAT MENACING SCENT CAME TO HIS NOSTRILS
TO THEIR SURPRISE THEY WERE MET BY JEFF'S TEETH
BUT AFTER ALL AS HE REMINDED HIMSELF SHE WAS ONLY A LITTLE COW MOOSE WHILE LONG JACKSON WAS A CHRISTIAN AND HIS PARTNER
HE WHIPPED UP HIS RIFLE AND FIRED AND THE WHITE WOLF DROPPED SPRAWLING OVER THE FRONT OF THE SLEDGE
BUT THOUGH MARY'S VITAL WARMTH WAS ABOUNDING AND INEXHAUSTIBLE THE STILL FEROCITY OF THE COLD MADE IT PERILOUS FOR THEM TO SLEEP LONG
BUT SHE HAD BEEN WELL TRAINED AND BRANNIGAN'S VOICE FROM TIME TO TIME KEPT HER FROM REVOLT
ON NEARER APPROACH HE MADE OUT THAT THE MONSTROUS SQUARE-WINGED BIRD WAS RIDDEN BY ONE OF THOSE MAN-CREATURES WHOM HE SO HATED AND DESPISED--RIDDEN AS HE HAD SEEN WITH WONDER AND SCORN THAT HORSES PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO BE
THE SEARCH WAS VAIN AS EVER
I'VE KINDER PROMISED THAT THERE UNFORTUNATE ORPHANT SHE SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERED NONE SHE'S TOO YOUNG YET TO FEND FER HERSELF
ONE OF THOSE BATTERING HOOFS THAT WERE PLAYING FOR HIM SO NIMBLY CAUGHT HIM ON THE HAUNCH
IF YE'D JEST SHAVE THAT LONG IRISH LIP O YOURN TOM SHE'D TAKE YE FER ONE O FAMILY RIGHT ENOUGH HE DUCKED HIS HEAD AND HOISTED AN ELBOW TO WARD OFF THE EXPECTED RETORT
SHE HAD A MAD IMPULSE TO SLAM IT IN THE MONSTER'S FACE AND BRACE HERSELF HOWEVER IMPOTENTLY AGAINST IT
GRADUALLY THE HOST QUICKENED ITS MARCH LEAVING ITSELF LITTLE TIME FOR FEEDING AND ONLY ENOUGH REST FOR THE VITALLY ESSENTIAL PROCESS OF RUMINATION
BUT BEFORE HE WAS WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE THE NARROW HEAD OF THE HERON WAS DRAWN FAR BACK BETWEEN HER SHOULDERS AND THE LONG STRAIGHT JAVELIN OF HER BILL PRESENTED ITS POINT DIRECTLY TOWARD THE ATTACK
A BIG HALF-SUBMERGED ROOT JUTTING OUT FOR ABOUT THREE FEET DIRECTLY OVER THAT SECTION OF THE POOL WHERE THE SUCKERS CONGREGATED AFFORDED THE GREAT LYNX JUST THE POST OF VANTAGE WHICH HE LOVED
BUT HERE IN EACH CASE WAS A QUESTION OF THE HONOR OF THE WILDS
WHAT THEY SEE AND HEAR THERE SUGGEST STORIES ABOUT YOUNG ANIMALS THE CHILDREN OF THE WILD THESE TALES ARE RECOUNTED BY UNCLE ANDY
HE WAS NOT THE ONLY HUNTER OF MOUNTAIN SHEEP IN THAT PARTICULAR CORNER OF THE MOUNTAINS
THEN THE TWO MEN SET THE ROPE TRACES OF THE DRAG OVER THE HOMESPUN SHOULDERS AND GRUNTING AT THE FIRST TUG STARTED UP THE TRAIL WITH THEIR LOAD
TWO-THIRDS OF THIS HORIZON RIM WERE OF DARK GREEN WOODS THREADED WITH THE GLEAMING SILVER OF WATER-COURSES
HE HAD THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CHASE THE SATISFACTION OF STRETCHING HIS STRONG LITHE MUSCLES IN THE RACE ACROSS THE HARD SNOW
IT WAS NOT TILL FAIRLY WELL ALONG IN THE AFTERNOON THEREFORE THAT SHE AWOKE TO THE FACT THAT SHE HAD NOT COVERED MORE THAN HALF THE DISTANCE WHICH SHE HAD TO TRAVEL
AT THE SOUND THE FAINTING GIRL ON THE PILE OF DEERSKINS OPENED EYES WHICH GREW SUDDENLY WILD AND DARK
THE WHITE MEN KILLED SAVAGELY AND INSATIABLY ALL ALONG BOTH FLANKS AS IF NOT THE NEED OF HIDES AND MEAT BUT THE SHEER LUST OF KILLING POSSESSED THEM
HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED ANY SUCH SOPHISTRY
INSTEAD OF THAT IT WAS THRUST BEHIND HIM AS SOMETHING PRECIOUS TO BE GUARDED WITH HIS LIFE
IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE SECONDS AS HE STRUGGLED TOWARD HIS GUN PETE ALLEN THOUGHT OF A THOUSAND THINGS MOSTLY UNIMPORTANT
HAVING RUBBED HIS HANDS AND SLEEVES ACROSS THE HIDE OF THE DEAD MOTHER HE WAS GENTLY APPROACHING THE CALF WITH SOFT WORDS OF CARESS AND REASSURANCE
THE WHITE WOLF ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE WAS BORN IN THE SMOKE-SMELLING WIGWAM BESIDE THE LONE MICHIKAMAW THERE HAD COME A STRANGE LONG HOWLING OF THE WIND AMID THE CLEFT GRANITE HEIGHTS WHICH OVERHUNG THE WATER
THE CALF TOOK SEVERAL STEPS FORWARD FROM THE THICKET AND STARED IN DISTRACTION AFTER THEM
HE DROPPED DOWN UPON HER QUITE CASUALLY AS UPON A SURE AND EASY VICTIM
IN A SOMEWHAT NARROW SPIRAL HE NOW BEGAN HIS DESCENT GRADUALLY AND UNDER POWER THAT HE MIGHT BE IN FULL READINESS TO GRAPPLE WITH THE TREACHEROUS GUSTS WHICH CAME LEAPING UP AT HIM FROM UNDER THE BRINK OF THE PLATEAU
HE WAS TOO WELL AWARE THAT IN AN OPEN COMBAT HE WAS MORE THAN LIKELY TO GET HIS NECK OR HIS BACK INTO THE CLUTCH OF THOSE INEXORABLE TALONS AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF HIM
TOWARD EVENING LONG JACKSON BEGAN TO GO TO PIECES BADLY
THEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS FELLOW-TRIBESMAN WORN OUT WITH FLIGHT MAKING HIS LAST FIGHT ALONE IN THE SILENCE AND THE SNOW
THEN ONCE MORE THAT UNCANNY IMPRESSION OF BEING TRAILED BEGAN TO TINGLE IN HIS CHEEKS AND STIR THE ROOTS OF THE HAIR ON HIS NECK
TWOULDN'T DO GOOD FER I WOULDN'T TECH A SLIVER OF HER NOT EF I WAS DYIN AN IT WOULD JEST BE ON-PLEASANT FER MARY BRANNIGAN DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF FOR THIS MEANT AT LEAST A POSTPONEMENT OF THE UNHAPPY HOUR
AND AS THE TOP OF BALD FACE FOR ALL ITS INACCESSIBILITY WAS LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE SEA-LEVEL HIS MONOPLANE SEEMED TO OFFER HIM AN EASY WAY TO IT
ALL AT ONCE HIS FACE CHANGED
OUTWARDLY COLD BUT BOILING WITHIN HATCH STALKED SLOWLY HOMEWARD IGNORING THE SCATTERED POLES ALONG THE WAY
IN A FLASH OF FURY HE WHEELED AND FIRED INTO THE THICKETS JUST BEHIND HIM
AT LAST IN DESPERATION AT SEEING HOW JEFF WAS GETTING PUNISHED BY THOSE RAKING CLAWS HE DROPPED THE AXE AGAIN AND SEIZED THE BEAST BY THE HIND LEGS
GOSH BUT YE'RE SPUNKY LITTLE DEVILS HE MUTTERED
MCLAGGAN WAS NOT NERVOUS ALTHOUGH FOR THIS JOURNEY HE HAD LEFT HIS RIFLE BEHIND HIM IN CAMP AND HE WAS AWARE THAT A PANTHER IF IT MEANT MISCHIEF WAS NOT AN ADVERSARY TO BE SCORNED
SHE GRUNTED COMPLAININGLY AT TIMES AND MADE GOOD-NATURED ATTEMPTS TO SHAKE HIM OFF
HIS CHARGE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN HEAVY DUCK-SHOT INTENDED FOR SOME LOW-FLYING FLOCK OF MIGRANT GEESE OR BRANT
HE FANCIED THAT HE SAW A GRAY SHADOW FADING OFF AMONG THE GRAY TRUNKS AND HE FIRED AT ONCE
DID YE THINK TO BRING ANYTHING TO EAT WITH YE NARY BITE RESPONDED JACKSON
WITH A YELL HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF BACKWARD VIOLENTLY
A YELLOW TANGLE OF CLAWS AND TEETH AND LEGS AND FUR SURGED AND BOUNCED UPON JOHN HATCH'S BODY
BUT WATER WAS ALL THEY CLUTCHED
BUT AFTER ALL SHE'S ONLY A LITTLE MOOSE COW
HE WAS PREPARED TO GAMBLE ON THIS SUPPOSITION
THE ANTAGONISTIC FEELINGS THAT EXIST BENEATH THE SHAGGY COATS AND THE METHODS OF STEALTHY WARFARE OF WILD BEASTS ARE ALL MINUTELY DESCRIBED AND THE ENEMIES ILLUSTRATED."--_BOOK NEWS MONTHLY IT IS SURPRISING HOW MUCH OF THE WILDERNESS HIS WISTFUL EYE DISCOVERS IN A CENTRAL PARK BUFFALO YARD
AS HE POURED OUT HIS GUTTURAL PLEADING A FEEBLE CHILD'S VOICE CAME TO HIS EARS AND HE LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH A SUDDEN TIGHTENING AT HIS HEART
HE PAUSED FOR A SECOND TO SNIFF THE FRAGRANCE AGAIN AND THEN LURCHED ONWARDS AT A ROLLING GALLOP
JOHN HATCH KNEW THAT THE MOTHER-LYNX HAD HE CAUGHT HER AT HOME WOULD HAVE PUT UP A VALIANT FIGHT IN DEFENSE OF HER BABIES
BUT HE CLEARED AWAY ALL THE UNDERGROWTH IN THE WOODS WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF THE PASTURE BARS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE COWS SCARED AT MILKING
BUT WITH HIS SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT AND HIS LONG PUNISHING JAWS HE FELT HIMSELF MUCH MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HER
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO HURL HIMSELF STRAIGHT UPON THE SLUMBERER'S THROAT
AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH INTEREST THE EAGLES
THE ANSWER CAME--A HEAVY COMFORTABLE SNORE FROM WITHIN THE CABIN
AND BEFORE HALF A DOZEN SHOTS WERE FIRED THEY HAD SLUNK OFF STRICKEN WITH PANIC
THE CHANGE WAS SO SUDDEN THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THE DUCK HAD BEEN METAMORPHOSED INTO A HAWK ON THE INSTANT BY THE STROKE OF AN INVISIBLE ENCHANTER'S WAND
THE WOLVES WERE GONE
GOOD RIDDANCE TO THAT RUBBISH HE MUTTERED AS HE STRODE ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
WITH A STARTLED CRY SHE SPRANG BACK HER SKIN CREEPING AT THE EMPTINESS
I HOPE THE PAINTER'LL GIT YE AFTER ALL HE CRIED WITH A BUNCH OF EXPLETIVES TOO VIRILE FOR THE COLD EXPOSURE OF THE PRINTED PAGE
HIS FACE ALONE HAD FAIRLY FILLED THE WINDOW
UPON ONE OF THESE GRAY RIBS THE GREAT GRAY BIRD ALIGHTED BALANCING HIMSELF UNSTEADILY FOR A MOMENT AS IF IN THE LAST STAGE OF EXHAUSTION AND THEN SETTLING TO AN IMMOBILITY THAT SEEMED TO MAKE HIM A PORTION OF THE WRECK ITSELF
SHE MAY PULL THROUGH
ARRIVED AT HOME HE FOUND THE OLD SORREL WITH THE EMPTY DRAG WAITING AT THE GATE TO BE LET IN AND JEFF WHO ALWAYS STAYED AT HOME TO GUARD THE HOUSE WAGGING HIS TAIL INTERROGATIVELY BESIDE HER PUZZLED TO KNOW WHY SHE HAD COME HOME WITHOUT HER MASTER OR HER LOAD
A HOARSE CRY WHETHER OF GRIEF OR HORROR BURST FROM THE LIPS OF WIND-IN-THE-NIGHT AS THE MYSTIC WHITE SHAPE OF HIS PROTECTOR SPRANG AT THE OLD BRAVE'S THROAT
BURROWING DOWN THROUGH THE LIGHT SOIL HE DUG HIMSELF A LITTLE CELLAR THE FLOOR OF WHICH WAS THE STRATUM OF PERPETUAL FROST
HE LOOKED AGAIN TO ASSURE HIMSELF AND CALMLY PULLED ON HIS MITTENS
THOUGH JUST WHEN THE PANGS OF APPETITE MAY COME BACK UPON HIM WITH A RUSH NO FISHERMAN CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY
THEN HE TROTTED AWAY INTO THE FOREST AGAIN TO HUNT WOOD-MICE
KEEN AS WERE THE RAT'S EYES THEY DID NOT NOTICE THE GHOST-GRAY ERECT FIGURE SITTING UP LIKE A POST BESIDE THE GRASS-FRINGE
BUT ALREADY MCLAGGAN HAD SWUNG HIMSELF INTO THE TREE JUST OUT OF REACH LEAVING HIS PACK AT THE FOOT
THE STROKE CAUGHT HIM FULL IN THE WING-ELBOW SPLITTING IT AND TOTALLY DISABLING HIM FOR FLIGHT
WHAT DID I TELL YE DEMANDED BRANNIGAN DRYLY
SINCE THEN THE MEN OF X NOT BEING WHOLEHEARTED OR SKILLED MOUNTAIN-CLIMBERS ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS HAD ENDED IN FAILURE
MCLAGGAN SHRIEKED
HUNTING EASILY AND WHEN THE MOOD WAS UPON HIM HE BROUGHT THREE MORE LEMMINGS TO THE STOREHOUSE THAT SAME DAY
HE EVEN ACHIEVED TO SCRATCH THE SKIN BENEATH AND DRAW BLOOD
THE MOST SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF A BULL ELK THAT MCLAGGAN'S EYES HAD EVER RESTED UPON HE STOPPED SHORT IN HIS PURSUIT AT SIGHT OF THE GRAY ERECT FIGURE STANDING THERE MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE TRAIL
IN ONE BOUND THE GIRL WAS AT THE DOOR AND HAD SHUT IT WITH A BANG
BROWN BULL COULD NOT TOLERATE THE SIGHT OF THE GRAY WOLVES TRIUMPHING
BUT HE WAS NO FOOL AND HIS VOCATION FORCED HIM TO THINK QUICKLY
REALIZING THE IMMINENCE OF HIS DANGER FROM THESE VORTICES MACCREEDY CHANGED HIS COURSE AND SWEPT BACK AGAIN AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARD THE OPEN HIS MACHINE CAREERING WICKEDLY IN THE EDDIES AND UPTHRUSTS OF AIR
THE B'ARS LL GIT HER IF WE DON'T ARGUED LONG JACKSON
THE OTHER TWO SANK AGAIN INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS
THE MOST CASUAL AND UNINITIATED OF OBSERVERS WOULD HAVE SAID SO AT A GLANCE
BUT IT WAS JUST HERE THAT THE RED PROWLER'S CUNNING OVERREACHED ITSELF
AFTER A TIME INDEED HATCH FELT HIMSELF ONCE MORE SO COMPLETELY AT HOME IN HIS FAMILIAR WILDERNESS THAT THE TENSION OF HIS NERVES RELAXED AND THE EXASPERATING EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST WEEKS WERE FORGOTTEN
FOR EVEN AMONG THE WILD KINDREDS THE PRIZE IS NOT ALWAYS TO HIM OF NIMBLE WIT
THE FLAT ROAR OF THE YELLOW FLOOD UPON ITS REEFS AND SAND BANKS MIXED WITH THE BELLOWINGS AND TRAMPLINGS OF THE HOST TO FORM A THUNDER WHICH COULD BE HEARD IN THE FAR-OFF FOOTHILLS TRANSMUTED THERE TO A MURMUR LIKE THE SEA
SHE FELT COLD AND TIRED AND SMALL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
HE WANTED THOSE FISH EXCEEDINGLY
THE FISHER OF THE CHUTES MEANWHILE WAS SWIMMING STRAIGHT DOWNSTREAM FOR THE BROKEN WATER
SO HE WAS OBLIGED TO WATCH GREEDILY AND SAVAGELY THE GREAT SALMON THE GRILSE AND THE LARGER TROUT AS THEY DARTED THROUGH THE SLIDING GLOW BENEATH HIS PERCH
HE WAS SURE THAT THE CHANCES WERE A HUNDRED TO ONE AGAINST THIS UNSEEN PURSUER DARING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON HIM OR EVEN CONTEMPLATING SUCH A PIECE OF RASHNESS
JABE SMITH HAD NO CHILDREN TO COMPLICATE THE SITUATION
THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT PERHAPS HE OUGHT IN COURTESY TO THROW A CHUNK OF PEMMICAN TO HIS PROTECTOR WHO WAS NOW PACING SLOWLY AND METHODICALLY TO AND FRO BEFORE HIM LIKE A SENTINEL WITH EYES FIXED EVER ON THOSE WAITING HORDES
AS THE DAY WORE ON AND HIS APPETITE GREW MORE AND MORE INSISTENT IN AN ABSENT-MINDED WAY HE BEGAN TO GNAW AT THE GOOD RED MEAT BESIDE HIM
TO BLUE FOX SLEEPING WARM IN HIS DRY BURROW WHEN HE WOULD AND SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS DEEP-STORED SUPPLIES THE GATHERING MENACE OF THE COLD BROUGHT NO TERRORS
HE WAS NOT AFRAID PHYSICALLY FOR HIS MUSCLES AND HIS NERVES STRETCHED TO THE THOUGHT OF THE GREAT FIGHT HE WOULD MAKE BEFORE THE GRAY BEASTS SHOULD PULL HIM DOWN
THEY TOOK HALF-MILE TURNS AS NEAR AS THEY COULD GUESS AT GOING AHEAD TO BREAK THE WAY
HERE SHE DELIBERATELY SET FIRE TO THE DRY WOODWORK NURSING WITH HAND AND BREATH THE TINY UPLICKING FLAMES
HE SIMPLY SHOT FROM HIS PLACE AT SUCH SPEED THAT THE EYE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH HOW HE DID IT AND IN THE MINUTEST FRACTION OF A SECOND WAS CURLED WITHIN THE EMPTY FISHING-BASKET WHICH STILL LAY ON ITS SIDE HALF OPEN
SHE WAS SOMETIMES A BIT LONELY TO BE SURE WHEN BRANNIGAN AND JACKSON WERE AWAY ON THEIR SNOW-SHOES TENDING THEIR WIDE CIRCUIT OF TRAPS AND SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER PEN
THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT WOULD SERVE
IN THEM MR ROBERTS SHOWS THAT HE KNOWS HIS FELLOWMEN FULLY AS WELL AS HE KNOWS THE LORE OF THE WOODS AND THE HAUNTS AND HABITS OF THE ANIMALS OF THE FOREST
THEN WITH A WILD BELLOW HE LUNGED FORWARD AT A GALLOP APPARENTLY TO MEET THE ONCOMING DOOM
SHE MUST HEV A BABY IN YONDER HOLE
HE KEPT ON WITH HIS LONG LUMBERING GALLOP TILL HE HAD HIS HERD WELL CLEAR OF ALL THE STRUGGLING REMNANTS OF THE HOST WHICH HE SAW RUNNING AIMLESSLY THIS WAY AND THAT THE SLAUGHTERERS HANGING TO THEM LIKE WOLVES
HE HAD STRUCK TOO QUICKLY DECEIVED BY THE SWIRL OF THE CURRENT AND MISSED HIS FISH
INDIGNANTLY THE TWO MEN POUNCED UPON IT AND CLEARED IT OFF HOPING TO FIND A FEW SPARKS STILL SURVIVING
OUT OF THEM ALL SHE CLUNG TO JUST ONE AS POSSIBLY OFFERING SOME HOPE IN THE LAST EMERGENCY
PASTURAGE WAS ABUNDANT THE TEMPERS OF THE GREAT BULLS WERE BOLD AND PUGNACIOUS AND NOTHING SEEMED LESS LIKELY THAN THAT ANY DISASTER COULD MENACE SO MIGHTY AND INVINCIBLE A HOST
IN THIS INEXORABLE SOUTHWARD DRIFT THE RIGHT FLANK PASSED ONE MORNING OVER A STEEP LITTLE KNOLL THE CREST OF WHICH CHANCED TO BE OCCUPIED BY BROWN BULL AND HIS HERD JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE MOVING RANKS CAME TO A HALT FOR THE FORENOON SIESTA
BUT THE FIRE NOW WELL ESTABLISHED SEEMED ACTUALLY TO REGARD THE FLUFFY SNOW AS SO MUCH MORE CONGENIAL FUEL
IT HAD COME TO BIRTH TOO LATE
THEY SCOOPED A NEW TRENCH CLEAR IN THE OPEN
THE HOST LIVED FOUGHT FED AS IT WENT HALTING ONLY FOR SLEEP AND THE HOURS OF REST
BUT THE SUPREME THING IN THE CUB'S EYES WAS THE FACT SHE HAD SOMETHING THAT ASSUAGED HIS APPETITE
FAILING IN THIS HE SPRANG VIOLENTLY SIDEWAYS AND AT THE SAME TIME BEING A BEAST OF RESOURCE HE STRUCK BACK WITH THE PRONGS OF HIS ANTLERS BY JERKING HIS MUZZLE SHARPLY UPWARD
SHE GAVE THE CUB A REASSURING LICK DEFTLY SET IT ASIDE WITH HER GREAT PAWS AND THRUST HER HEAD FORTH CAUTIOUSLY FROM THE DOOR OF THE DEN
YE BETTER HOLD ON MR CLANCY SAID HE AN THINK IT OVER
THE SIGHT THAT MET HIS SHREWD EYES AS HE EMERGED WARILY FROM THE COVER OF THE FIR WOODS AMAZED HIM
WITH A GRUNT HE BOUNDED INTO THE AIR COMING DOWN UPON ALL FOUR FEET AGAIN STIFF-LEGGED LIKE A BUCKING HORSE AS IF THINKING THE JAR MIGHT SHAKE HIS ASSAILANT OFF
GOING NOISELESSLY AS A CAT IN HIS COWHIDE LARRIGANS BRANNIGAN MADE HIS WAY DOWN THE NARROW TRAIL BETWEEN THE STIFF DARK RANKS OF THE SPRUCE TIMBER TOWARD THE LAKE
IT WAS A POSSESSION WHICH ENTHUSIASTIC MEMBERS OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ELKS WERE ALWAYS READY TO PAY WELL FOR
THE BEAR LIFTED HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP ON HIS HIND LEGS CONVULSIVELY PAWING AT THE AIR THEN DROPPED ON ALL FOURS RAN ROUND IN A CIRCLE WITH HIS HEAD BENT INWARDS AND FELL OVER ON HIS SIDE
THE COOK FELT DESPERATELY FOR ANOTHER CARTRIDGE
BUT AS YET IT WAS NO MORE THAN THE SUGGESTION OF AN INSTINCT TOO FEEBLE AND FUMBLING TO SWAY THE OBSTINATE HORDES
SUDDENLY A DENSE THICKET HALF-A-DOZEN YARDS OR SO DISTANT FROM THE LEISURELY COW BURST OPEN AS WITH AN EXPLOSION AND A TOWERING BLACK FORM SHOT OUT FROM THE HEART OF IT
HE TURNED HOMEWARD SOMEWHAT RELIEVED TOWARD MILKING TIME
TO HIS EYES STILL FULL OF THE SUNLIGHT THE BROWN-GREEN GLOOM WAS ALMOST BLACKNESS FOR THE MOMENT
BUT HIS MOST MINUTE SEARCH COULD DISCOVER NO TRAIL SAVE HERE AND THERE A LIGHT DISTURBANCE OF THE SPRUCE NEEDLES
FOR A FEW SECONDS HE ALMOST PLAYED WITH HER
BUT HE WAS NO ADEPT IN THE LANGUAGE OF DOGS AND JINNY FAILING FOR ONCE TO UNDERSTAND REMAINED DISCONSOLATE
THERE WAS NONE TO BE FOUND
HE EXAMINED THE TRACKS MINUTELY AND PRESENTLY MADE OUT THAT THE TRAVELER WAS GOING UNSTEADILY WITH AN OCCASIONAL STUMBLE AS IF FROM WEARINESS OR WEAKNESS
THAT SEEMED TO HIM A DEMONSTRATION OF ARDOR WHICH IF PRACTICED BY A SEVEN-HUNDRED-POUND BEAR MIGHT BE A LITTLE OVERWHELMING
BUT THE FACT THAT THAT TRIUMPH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER AN UNQUALIFIED ONE REMAINED A SECRET BETWEEN MACCREEDY AND THE EAGLES
BETWEEN THE WAVELESS PALLOR OF THE WATER AND THE WINDLESS WARM GLOW OF THE GRASS WAS DRAWN A NARROW RIBAND OF COPPER RED--THE SMOOTH MUD FLATS LEFT NAKED BY THE TIDE
THE PLAIN UNCERTAINTY IS APT TO DAUNT THEM BOTH
BEFORE HIM WAS A BROAD TRAIL JUST SUCH AS JABE SMITH AND HIS WOOD SLED USED TO MAKE
ROBERTS WHOSE STORIES OF FORESTS AND STREAMS ARE READ WITH PLEASURE BY YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE TWO WERE ONCE MORE CIRCLING AND SPARRING FOR VANTAGE AS BEFORE
HE SAW THE YOUNG EWE PENNED IN HER CORNER
FOR SOME SECONDS THE TWO GNASHED SNARLING IN EACH OTHER'S FACES
AFTER ALL WHATEVER MARY'S OWN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT IT WOULD BE AN END ALTOGETHER WORTHY OF HER
SHE WRUNG HER HANDS BUT IN THE NEW SELF-POSSESSION WHICH HAD COME TO HER SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE END HAD REALLY ARRIVED
THEY SHOOK THEMSELVES AND STARTED ON AGAIN CONSIDERABLY REFRESHED BUT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY
A MINUTE OR TWO MORE HOWEVER AND IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO IGNORE THE APPROACHING BIRDS WHO WERE RISING AT HIM WITH UNMISTAKABLE MANIFESTATIONS OF RAGE
AFTER THIS WHEN HATCH'S AFFAIRS TOOK HIM INTO THE WOODS JEFF WENT WITH HIM
THEN OUT OF THE TAIL OF HIS EYE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SEVERAL ELK COWS--THE HERD STEALING WARILY DOWN THE TRAIL TO SEE HOW IT WAS FARING WITH THEIR VICTORIOUS LORD
D
D
D
D
D
D
D
D
D
D
EF IT HADN'T A BEEN FER MARY WE WOULDN'T BE ALIVE NOW SAID HE STERNLY
HE DREW BACK HASTILY AND SAT DOWN ON HIS TAIL EARS COCKED AND HEAD TILTED TO ONE SIDE TO CONSIDER
WOOF TURNED AND LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT THE MAN HAD FIRED AT
THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH PETE ALLEN'S SHOOTING OR WITH HIS NERVE
BRANNIGAN'S MARY BRANNIGAN WAS WANTING FRESH MEAT RED MEAT
HE STOPPED SHORT
IT WAS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THEIR NESTLINGS WERE MOST HELPLESS AND THAT IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE WHITE-HEADED EAGLES WILL FACE ALL ODDS WITH AN INCOMPARABLE FEROCITY OF VALOR AT THE HINT OF MENACE TO THEIR SKYEY HOMES
HE TRAVERSED THE CIRCUIT OF THE PLATEAU PEERING DOWNWARD ANXIOUSLY AND AT LAST MANAGED ROUGHLY TO LOCATE THE THREE NESTS
WHEN AFTER AN HOUR'S HARD WORK PUSHING THROUGH MATTED THICKETS AND CROSSING JAGGED GULLIES HE CAME OUT UPON A KNOLL WHICH COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE PEAK HE SAW THAT THE GREAT RAM HAD DISAPPEARED
HE SAW JEFF WITH ONE LYNX DOWN SLASHING AT ITS THROAT WHILE THE OTHER CLUNG UPON HIS BACK AND RIPPED HIM WITH ITS CLAWS
SHE HEARD THE SCREWS OF A HINGE BEGIN TO DRAW WITH AN OMINOUS GRATING SOUND
IT'S THE WOLVES'LL BE GITTIN THE LOAD AN HIM TOO GROWLED ANOTHER
AROUND TO FULL SOUTH AND WEST AND NORTH LAY AN INFERTILE REGION THIN-SOILED AND ROCKY PRODUCING LITTLE TIMBER BUT HEMLOCK AND STUNTED PAPER BIRCH AND THEREFORE NOT WORTH THE ATTENTION OF EITHER THE LUMBERMAN OR THE SQUATTER
IT HAS ALSO TAUGHT THEM UNVERACITY BY GIVING THEM ABUNDANT TIME FOR THE WEAVING OF TALES WHEREWITH TO AMUSE THE CREDULOUS
AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE DESIRED LESS THAN AN IMMEDIATE REPETITION OF IT
BUT HE DID NOT HESITATE
BUT MEANWHILE HE HAD NOT TAKEN HIS EYES FOR A MOMENT FROM THAT PORTENTOUS SHAPE CIRCLING SO MYSTERIOUSLY ABOVE THE GREEN FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN AND HE HAD NOT SEEN IT EITHER SWOOP OR MOUNT OR ONCE FLAP ITS FLAT-SPREAD WINGS
WITH A LOUD WOO-OOF OF INDIGNATION AND ALARM HE RECOILED TURNED TAIL SCURRIED OUT INTO THE ROAD AND DISAPPEARED
THE UNFORTUNATE HEIFER WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE PROPERTY OF JABE SMITH
SHE'S COMIN TO STOP WITH US
BUT WITH PERHAPS A DIM PREVISION OF THE DAY WHEN HE SHOULD BE OLD AND FEEBLE AND DRIVEN OUT FROM THE HERD HE COULD NOT IGNORE THEM
BUT YE AIN'T A-GOIN TO GROW UP TO USE THEM CLAWS ON MY SHEEP NUR MY DAWG AN DON'T YE FERGIT IT FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT OF WRINGING THEIR NECKS AS THE SIMPLEST WAY OF GETTING THE MATTER OFF HIS HANDS
MOREOVER NOW THAT MACCREEDY WAS OUT OF THE MACHINE ERECT UPON HIS FEET GLARING UP AT THEM WITH MASTERFUL EYES AND SHOUTING AT THEM IN THOSE HUMAN TONES WHICH ALL THE WILD KINDREDS FIND SO DISCONCERTING THEY WERE MUCH MORE AFRAID OF HIM THAN BEFORE
HE WAS ALMOST ON THE POINT OF GIVING UP AND STEALING AWAY TO HUNT RABBITS WHEN FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIS RUFF BRISTLE AND EVERY HAIR STAND UP IN JEALOUS WRATH
HE SETTLED HIMSELF BACK UPON HIS HAUNCHES TO SPRING INTO THE WAGON
IN HIS OWN DESOLATE NORTH THE GREAT GRAY OWL KNEW THAT NO CREATURE ON WINGS COULD RIVAL HIM
THE OTTER SHRANK BACK A LITTLE
HE REALIZED A PAIR OF ROUND PALE BALEFUL EYES PIERCING WITH PAIN AND VENGEFUL FURY FIXED UPON HIM AS THEY FLOATED ALONG CLOSE TO THE GROUND IN THE MIDST OF A GLIDING SHAPE OF SHADOW
WITH A MIGHTY EFFORT HE SAT UP
BRANNIGAN RAISED HIS RIFLE AND WAITED TILL THE PAIR SHOULD COME WITHIN EASIER RANGE
SEEING NOTHING TO TAKE ALARM AT IT MADE A WIDE CIRCUIT RAN BEHIND THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED AS THE FOX HAD DONE AT THE CORNER NEAREST THE WAGON
HIS AUTHORITY SEEMED TO BE UNQUESTIONABLE FOR NOT A WOLF VENTURED TO PASS HIM
HE CAME AT ONCE HOPEFULLY
THE BLACK BEAR LOVES SWEETS AND BERRIES FAR BETTER THAN ANY FLESH FOOD HOWEVER DAINTY
IT FELL ON HIS SHOULDERS EMPTYING MOST OF ITS CONTENTS INTO THE LONG HAIR ON THE RIDGE OF HIS NECK
HE MUST THINK OF HIS OWN FIRST AND SAVE HIS LIFE FOR THEM
SHE HEARD THE BEAR MOVING AGAIN OUTSIDE
THE TRAIL FROM THE NATASHQUOUAN WAS LEADING HIM ALMOST DUE NORTH
THEIR AMAZEMENT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THEIR OWN LONG AND POWERFUL WINGS WHICH WERE ABLE TO OVERTAKE SO EASILY THE FLIGHT OF THE AGILE FISH-HAWK WERE FORCED TO BEAT FURIOUSLY IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE STRANGER WHO WAS APPARENTLY MAKING NO EFFORT AT ALL
HE KNEW THE OWL FOR ONE OF HIS MOST DANGEROUS RIVALS AND ADVERSARIES
THEY PAWED THE GROUND SNORTED NOISILY AND THEN CHARGED WITH THEIR MASSIVE HEADS LOW DOWN
NOW HE LAUGHED GRIMLY AND RESUMED HIS DESCENT
THE GIRL SPRANG UP
JOHN HATCH SLOWLY CAME TO
HE WAS AFRAID TO SHOW HIMSELF TO HER BUT HIS HUNGER COUPLED WITH CURIOSITY LED HIM TO TRACK HER PERHAPS IN THE HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT FALL DEAD IN THE TRAIL AND SO MAKE IT SAFE FOR HIM TO APPROACH AND TASTE
IT LOOKS FAT AN JUICY BUT BRANNIGAN HIS OWN FIRST IMPULSE IN REGARD TO THE POOR YOUNGSTER NOW QUITE FORGOTTEN PROTESTED WITH FERVOR
THEN WITH HER STOVE-PIPE SHOVEL SHE STARTED ANOTHER FIRE IN THE FURTHER CORNER OF THE CAMP AND YET ANOTHER IN THE UPPERMOST BUNK
AND AFTER A HALF-MILE'S FURTHER TRAVELING WHILE YET THERE WAS DAYLIGHT ENOUGH TO DISCOURAGE THE WOLVES FROM SHOWING THEMSELVES HE FOUND IT
SISSY BEMBRIDGE KNEW THAT IT WOULD DIE DOWN AT ONCE AND THEN--WELL HER LAST CARD WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAYED
FROM BEHIND A CORNER OF THE RUINED CABIN PEERED CRAFTILY A RED FOX
THE BULL EYED THIS PHENOMENON AND THEN SCORNFUL OF WHAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND PRODDED THE CAN WITH AN EVISCERATING ANTLER
HE HURRIEDLY DEVOURED ABOUT HALF THE CONTENTS OF THE LUNCH-BASKET TRANSFERRED THE REST TO HIS DIRTY BUNDLE AND WITH HUGE SATISFACTION LIGHTED A HALF-BURNED CIGAR WHICH ONE OF THE FISHERMEN HAD LEFT LYING ON A LOG
HE APPEARED IRRESOLUTE AS TO THE SOUTHWARD MARCH OR ELSE AS TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE HOST
HE LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE HARE
SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE OVER-CRAFTY FOX A BACKWOODS TRAMP CAME BY WITH A RAGGED LITTLE BUNDLE SLUNG FROM THE STICK ON HIS SHOULDER
AND IN SPITE OF THE SAVAGE FIGHT HE PUT UP THEY TORE HIM LITERALLY TO PIECES
HIS INSTINCT WORKED QUICKER THAN THOUGHT
THE BOY WAS VERY SICK SAID HE CALMLY UNJARRED BY THE DREADFUL ORDEAL WHICH HE HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH
