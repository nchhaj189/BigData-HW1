BUT HIS FIRMLY-SET LIPS HIS ERECT CARRIAGE THE DETERMINED GLANCE OF HIS EYES BORE WITNESS TO THE STRENGTH OF HIS NERVES AND THE POWER OF HIS INTELLECT
THE PORTER WENT YAWNING TO MAKE THIS INQUIRY AND CAME BACK BY-AND-BY STILL YAWNING TO SAY THAT THERE WAS SUCH A LETTER AND WOULD THE GENTLEMAN PLEASE STEP INTO THE STATION-MASTER'S OFFICE TO CLAIM AND RECEIVE IT
HE GAVE CAIN A LONG LIFETIME IN WHICH TO REPENT OF HIS SINS MARGARET THOUGHT THIS AS SHE STOOD AT THE GATE LISTENING TO THE HORSE'S HOOFS UPON THE GRAVEL ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE GROUNDS AWAY INTO THE PARK
I SHALL BE VERY MUCH ENGAGED DURING THE FEW DAYS I AM LIKELY TO REMAIN IN TOWN AND SHALL BE UNABLE TO AFFORD MYSELF THE PLEASURE OF YOUR SOCIETY THE MAJOR STARED AGHAST AT THIS COOL DISMISSAL
THERE MUST BE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND NOW WHO KNEW THE BANKER IN INDIA
FROM THE TIME OF HIS MEETING THE OLD CLERK AT THE WATERLOO TERMINUS HE HAD NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF HENRY DUNBAR
HE WAS SOME LITTLE TIME DOING THIS AS HE HAD A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE RIGHT KEY
I COULDN'T BEAR IT MADGE MY GIRL
CAN YOU SEND A MESSENGER TO THE FERNS TO ASK IF HE HAS BEEN SEEN THERE CERTAINLY SIR
AND I HAD SEEN ALL THE INTENSITY OF HER ANGUISH WHEN THE SECRET OF HIS EXISTENCE WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME THE SECRET OF HIS GUILT BECAME KNOWN TO HER
FOR THE REST OF THE FEATURES I MUST REFER MY NEW ZEALANDER TO THE PICTURES OF THE OLD ITALIAN MASTERS--OF WHICH I TRUST HE MAY RETAIN A HANDSOME COLLECTION;--FOR ONLY ON THE CANVASES OF SIGNORI RAFFAELLO SANZIO D'URBINO TITIAN AND THE PUPILS WHO EMULATED THEM WILL HE FIND THAT EXQUISITE HARMONY THAT PURITY OF FORM AND TENDER SOFTNESS OF OUTLINE WHICH I BEHELD THAT SUMMER EVENING IN THE FEATURES OF MARGARET WENTWORTH
THE POLICE ARE AT WORK
IS SHE STILL ASLEEP MOTHER HE ASKED
LEASTWAYS IF IT AIN'T QUITE BLUE IT'S A MUCH LIGHTER BLACK THAN THE REST OF THE SKY AND THAT'S SOMETHING
WHY SHOULD YOU WAIT FOR HIM AT THE CATHEDRAL ARTHUR LOVELL LISTENED WITH A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE
NO MAN COULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMPLETELY A PRISONER THAN THIS MAN HAD BECOME BY THE RESULT OF THE FATAL ACCIDENT NEAR RUGBY
ASK GOD TO BLESS ME UPON THIS DAY PAPA THE GIRL SAID IN A LOW TENDER VOICE AS THESE TWO PEOPLE TOOK THEIR PLACES SIDE BY SIDE IN THE ROOMY CHARIOT
WE SHALL NEVER CATCH HER ONE OF THE MEN SAID HELPING HIMSELF TO A CUPFUL OF SPIRIT OUT OF THE STONE-BOTTLE IN A SUDDEN ACCESS OF DESPONDENCY
HE WROTE FROM WARWICKSHIRE TO ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST FASHIONABLE JEWELLERS AT THE WEST END AND REQUESTED THAT A PERSON WHO WAS THOROUGHLY SKILLED IN HIS BUSINESS MIGHT BE SENT DOWN TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY DULY FURNISHED WITH DRAWINGS OF THE NEWEST DESIGNS IN DIAMOND NECKLACES EARRINGS C
THE WORST I SHALL DO IS TO SIT IN A TAVERN PARLOUR DRINK A GLASS OF GIN-AND-WATER AND READ THE PAPERS
IT WASN'T WRITTEN UNDER DICTATION AND SHE WASN'T BRIBED TO WRITE IT
EVERY DAY SHE HAD BEEN DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT
WHO DIED DECEMBER 19 1853
HE CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND OFFERED TO TAKE ME AWAY WITH HIM AND TO HAVE ME BROUGHT UP AMONGST HIS YOUNGER CHILDREN
SHE KNEW NOW THAT HE LED A DISHONEST LIFE
CALL YOUR MASTER DOWN
MR DUNBAR COULD YOU HEAR WHAT HE WAS SAYING NO SIR
VERY BAD
I WENT FOR A DRIVE YESTERDAY AND THE LADY'S MILE IS AS LONELY AS THE GREAT SAHARA
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I HAVE ALREADY BEEN WICKEDLY NEGLECTFUL OF A SOLEMN DUTY
I REMEMBER SEEING HIS MARRIAGE IN THE PAPERS TWENTY YEARS AGO
I WILL ACCEPT NO SENTENCE SUCH AS THIS UNTIL I KNOW THE REASON FOR PRONOUNCING IT
I WANT REST AND SOLITUDE AFTER ALL THIS TROUBLE AND EXCITEMENT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED AT WINCHESTER SOME MONTHS AGO THE BANKER'S HAND LOST ITS STEADINESS THE NECK OF THE CLARET-JUG KNOCKED AGAINST THE THIN LIP OF THE GLASS AND SHIVERED IT INTO HALF-A-DOZEN PIECES
WHILE I WAS LOOKING IDLY IN AT ONE OF THOSE SHOP-WINDOWS--IT WAS A FANCY-SHOP AND STATIONER'S--A KIND OF BAZAAR IN ITS HUMBLE WAY--MY EYE WAS ATTRACTED BY THE WORD MUSIC AND ON A LITTLE CARD HUNG IN THE WINDOW I READ THAT A LADY WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE LESSONS ON THE PIANO-FORTE AT THE RESIDENCES OF HER PUPILS OR AT HER OWN RESIDENCE ON VERY MODERATE TERMS
NO PRE-RAPHAELITE THEORIES IN THOSE DAYS SIR
I HAD GIVEN HIM MY WRITTEN ENGAGEMENT TO PAY THE HUNDRED POUNDS UPON THE DAY OF THE MURDERER'S ARREST AND I WAS VERY WELL ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING COMPELLED TO ASK HELP OF MY MOTHER
THEY ARE BOTH GOOD AND HONOURABLE MEN AND I THINK THAT SHAME WOULD KILL THEM
THE DETECTIVE SENT THIS MAN TO ASK IF MR DUNBAR'S DAUGHTER WOULD RECEIVE A STRANGER FROM LONDON ON MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS
I'LL HAVE IT OUT OF YOU FOR THIS MY FINE GENTLEMAN
HE MAY FEEL THE LIGHT HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND KNOW THAT HE IS A DOOMED MAN
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS CREPT SLOWLY PAST
HE'LL BE A MILCH COW--NOTHING BUT A MILCH COW
HIS HAT WAS MORE SHINY THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE HAT-MANUFACTURING INTEREST
HE WAS HAPPY AND HE SHARED HIS HAPPINESS AS FREELY AS HE SHARED HIS WEALTH
A CLEVER VILLAIN AND A BOLD ONE BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TOUCHES OF GOOD IN HIM I'M TOLD
BUT SOMETHING TRANSPIRED IN THAT INTERVIEW AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY MARGARET
HE WAS SO HAPPY WITH LAURA
I NEVER REALLY HOPED THAT LAURA DUNBAR WOULD BE MY WIFE JOHN LOVELL'S HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE
I DAREN'T GO AGAINST HIM
THEY WERE GREEDY AND IN THEIR BESOTTED AVARICE THEY KILLED THE GOOSE
DO YOUR DUTY MR CARTER
MRS MADDEN HAD EXPECTED THE YOUNG MAN'S PROPOSAL EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS
MY OLD SCHOOLFELLOW ARTHUR LOVELL WHO IS AS GOOD A FELLOW AS EVER BREATHED HAS BEEN EDUCATED FOR THE LAW AND IS NOW A SOLICITOR
HE WENT UP TO LONDON BY THE MAIL-TRAIN AFTER PARTING FROM CLEMENT AUSTIN
THERE WERE ONLY THREE CARRIAGES IN THIS BRIEF BRIDAL TRAIN FOR MR DUNBAR HAD INSISTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO GRANDEUR NO DISPLAY
WELL MY DEAR YOU REALLY SURPRISE ME
BUT THOUGH HE WAS NOW AS WELL DRESSED AND AS GENTLEMANLY-LOOKING AS ANY MAN IN SOUTHAMPTON HE TURNED INTO THE FIRST BY-STREET AND HURRIED AWAY FROM THE TOWN TO A LONELY WALK BESIDE THE WATER
BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY WHEN MARGARET HAD TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD TO TELL
BUT THERE WERE CASES MUCH WORSE THAN THAT OF THE BANKER
SHE HAD BEEN A SPOILED CHILD
THE OCCUPANT OF THE COTTAGE WAS SITTING IN AN ARM-CHAIR BY THE FIRE
THE BLUSH WAS ALL THE MORE BECOMING TO HER INASMUCH AS SHE WAS NATURALLY VERY PALE
A TENDER SMILE THAT WAS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL FOR IT WAS THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO IS PREPARED TO RESIGN HIS OWN HAPPINESS FOR THE SAKE OF HER HE LOVES
I AM GOING MARGARET HE SAID IN A TONE OF WOUNDED FEELING
I HAVE TRIED TO SAVE YOU--I HAVE TRIED TO SAVE YOU
WEEP AND WE WILL CRY OUT UPON YOUR TEARS
HE LOVED HER
HE WAS AWKWARD WITH THE KEY OF HIS DESK
SHE WAITED UNTIL HER HEART GREW SICK BUT STILL SHE DID NOT DESPAIR OF HIS RETURN
MY OLD SCHOOLFELLOW MICHAEL MARSTON MARRIED AND SETTLED AT THE FERNS DURING MY ABSENCE IN INDIA
PEOPLE LOVED HIM
HE DID NOT LEAVE MAUDESLEY ABBEY UNTIL HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT AND HE CARRIED AWAY IN HIS POCKET-BOOK CHEQUES TO THE AMOUNT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
MY POOR UNHAPPY CHILD THE MAN WHO HAD MURDERED HENRY DUNBAR WEPT ALOUD OVER THE WHITE FACE OF HIS UNCONSCIOUS DAUGHTER
ALL THE POETRY OF HIS NATURE ALL THE BEST FEELINGS THE PUREST ATTRIBUTES OF AN IMPERFECT CHARACTER CONCENTRATED THEMSELVES INTO ONE PASSION SIR PHILIP JOCELYN FELL IN LOVE
HE HATED SOLITUDE OR QUIET
I AM VERY COMFORTABLE IN MY POSITION THE JUNIOR PARTNER LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARED AT THE CASHIER AS IF HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO DETECT THE TRACES OF INCIPIENT INSANITY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE
THEY STOOD A LITTLE ALOOF FROM HIM LOOKING AT HIM WITH RESPECTFUL INTEREST
THEY'RE SHALLOW ENOUGH IN SOME PLACES
REASON TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NONE
HE WAS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST DARING SCOUNDRELS THAT EVER STEPPED ON BOARD A CONVICT-SHIP
THE MAN LYING OPPOSITE THE FIRE TO-NIGHT LOOKED TEN YEARS OLDER THAN THE MAN WHO GAVE HIS EVIDENCE SO BOLDLY AND CLEARLY BEFORE THE CORONER'S JURY AT WINCHESTER
HENRY DUNBAR WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
BUT WE SHALL DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO MAKE YOUR SOJOURN AGREEABLE THE SURGEON COULD NOT HELP LOOKING CHEERFUL AS HE MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS IDEA HAS CREPT INTO MY MIND AND TO-NIGHT I RESOLVED TO COME TO YOU AND ASK YOU THE DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHETHER YOU WERE IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS UNHAPPY MAN AT FIRST MARGARET WILMOT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A CHOKING SOB
O GOD HAVE MERCY UPON HIM SHE CRIED
AND YET I WON'T THINK THAT
THERE IS A DOOR LEADING FROM THE YARD INTO A COURT THAT CONNECTS ST GUNDOLPH LANE WITH ANOTHER LANE AT THE BACK HE SAID IS THERE NOT HE POINTED TO THE DARK LITTLE YARD OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AS HE SPOKE
MRS AUSTIN HAD ONCE CHERISHED AMBITIOUS VIEWS WITH REGARD TO HER SON'S MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS
SECRETS ARE LIKE EVERY OTHER SORT OF ARTICLE
STRANGLED WITH A RUNNING-NOOSE OF ROPE
NO,--NO JOSEPH DON'T COME WITH ME,--DON'T COME WITH ME I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT YOU'VE NO TICKET I CAN GET ONE--OR YOU CAN GET ME ONE FOR I'VE NO MONEY--AT THE FIRST STATION WE STOP AT THEY WERE SEATED IN A SECOND-CLASS RAILWAY CARRIAGE BY THIS TIME
AND YET I HAD SO LITTLE TO DREAM ABOUT
FOOLED DUPED AND LAUGHED AT AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF HARD SERVICE
AND I SHOULDN'T THINK AS YOU WOULD WISH TO LOOK LIKE THAT MISS LAURA ON YOUR WEDDING-DAY
THE WORLD WOULD CALL ME BENEATH YOU IN STATION NOW
LONDON IS AS DULL AS A DESERT
IT MADE THINGS VERY SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE MR HARTGOLD THOUGHT TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
AND SHE COULD HAVE SPOKEN FREELY IN THE PRESENCE OF A KING
SOMETIMES A CRUEL STAB THAT GOES STRAIGHT HOME TO THE HEART WILL LEAVE THE FACE OF THE MURDERED AS CALM AS THE FACE OF A SLEEPING CHILD
I READ A STORY THE OTHER DAY--AT LEAST MY GIRL WAS READING IT TO ME
IF NOT I SHALL TAKE THE DIAMONDS TO PARIS AND GET THEM MADE UP THERE THE JEWELLER VENTURED TO SUGGEST THE INFERIORITY OF PARISIAN WORKMANSHIP AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF A FIRST-RATE ENGLISH ESTABLISHMENT
WELL SAMPSON WE WON'T DETAIN YOU ANY LONGER
YOU'VE GOT THE NECKLACE I SUPPOSE EH MY LADY NO
HOW LONG THE TIME SEEMS SHE SAID
SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOME ATTEMPT MADE TO FIND--THE--THE MURDERER YES SIR
SHE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN EVERYTHING
BUT I HAVE A WARRANT TO PREVENT YOU LEAVING WINCHESTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HOLD A WARRANT FOR YOUR APPREHENSION SIR FROM WHOM FROM SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE OUR CHIEF COUNTY MAGISTRATE
SINCE THAT NIGHT SHE ADDED I HAVE RECEIVED TWO ANONYMOUS ENCLOSURES--TWO ENVELOPES CONTAINING NOTES TO THE AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WITH THE WORDS FROM A TRUE FRIEND WRITTEN ACROSS THE FLAP OF THE ENVELOPE
YOU WILL GO TO SHORNCLIFFE WITH MY MOTHER CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID UPON THE EVENING AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE WIDOW
SHE HAD BLUSHED WHEN THE CASHIER FIRST ENTERED THE ROOM
BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN SO THE MURDERER WOULD NEVER HAVE LINGERED UPON THE SCENE OF HIS CRIME IN ORDER TO STRIP THE CLOTHES FROM HIS VICTIM'S BODY
THE BLACK-BEARDED ARTIST IN THE PAINT-SMEARED HOLLAND BLOUSE WAS IN NO MANNER PROOF AGAINST LADY JOCELYN'S FASCINATIONS
AS FOR YOU HE SAID YOU HAVE BEEN A SPOILT CHILD OF FORTUNE AND YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN HOW TO VALUE THE GOOD THINGS THAT PROVIDENCE HAS GIVEN YOU
AND IF YOUR BUSINESS IS SO VERY IMPORTANT PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE HER I SHOULD ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE BRISKLY
AND IN THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF THEIR HURRIED DEPARTURE THE BANKER HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING ANYTHING MORE TO HIS DAUGHTER
MR HUGH DUNBAR TAXED HIM WITH WHAT HE HAD DONE
AND THOUGH YOU HAVE REASON TO DESPISE ME I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL REFUSE TO RECEIVE MY TESTIMONY IN FAVOUR OF ANOTHER WHO HAS BEEN FALSELY SUSPECTED OF A TERRIBLE CRIME AND WHO HAS NEED OF JUSTIFICATION
MARGARET'S HEAD WAS STILL AVERTED
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM SO MANY OF HER BEST GIFTS AND HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM OVER AND ABOVE THE POWER TO ENJOY HER FAVOURS
MR DUNBAR IS MY FATHER AND THERE IS NO OTHER PORTRAIT OF HIM IN EXISTENCE
BY SLOW DEGREES THE GOSSIPS RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO THE IDEA THAT THE SECRET OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DEATH WAS TO REMAIN A SECRET FOR EVER
IT WAS ANSWERED BY AN ELDERLY MAN-SERVANT OUT OF LIVERY
YOU DIDN'T GO ON TO THE FERNS THEN SIR SAID THE VERGER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS MADGE TO HAVE TO FIGHT THAT BATTLE
IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO SIT THERE JABBER JABBER JABBER MISS DORA EXCLAIMED THE UNCEREMONIOUS ELIZABETH
I HAVE BEEN RUNNING AND THE WORDS SEEM TO CHOKE ME AS I SPEAK
THE MAJOR WAS VERY RESERVED UPON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SPORTING OPERATIONS WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF AMONG UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE
LOR BLESS YOU I'VE HEARD PLENTY OF LOVE-STORIES
IF ANYTHING CAN CONSOLE ME FOR THE LOSS OF MY DEAR GRANDFATHER IT IS THE THOUGHT THAT YOU WILL COME BACK AT LAST AND THAT I SHALL SEE YOU ONCE MORE
HE THOUGHT JOHN SCOTT A GREATER MAN THAN MACULLOCH
I THANK YOU MR BALDERBY HE SAID PROUDLY
MR DUNBAR HAD GONE BACK TO THE WINDOW AND HAD RESUMED HIS CONTEMPLATION OF THE STREET
WELL CARTER I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD FELLOW AND I'LL TRUST YOU I SAID
SHE HAD SEEN IN THAT BRIEF MOMENT A BRIGHT CONFUSION OF HOTHOUSE FLOWERS AND TRAILING SATIN CURTAINS GILDED MOULDINGS AND FRESCOED PANELS THE FIRST FEW SHALLOW STEPS OF A MARBLE STAIRCASE THE FILIGREE-WORK OF THE BRONZE BALUSTRADE
BUT YOU'LL COME HOME SOON WON'T YOU WHAT DO YOU CALL SOON MY LASS BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK
I HOPE I AM NOT TOO LATE TO BEAR WITNESS AGAINST HIM THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE
AND LOOKING OUT AT LIFE FROM THE ORIEL WINDOW OF HIS DRESSING-ROOM WHENCE HE SAW NOTHING BUT HIS OWN LAND NEATLY ENCLOSED IN A RING-FENCE HE THOUGHT THE WORLD ABOUT WHICH SOME PEOPLE MADE SUCH DISMAL HOWLING WAS UPON THE WHOLE AN EXTREMELY PLEASANT PLACE CONTAINING VERY LITTLE THAT A FELLOW NEED COMPLAIN OF
IT WAS NOT RESIGNATION FOR MY LIFE WAS EMPTY AND DESOLATE WITHOUT MARGARET
I CAN'T SEE ANY ONE LOVELL
HE WAS A PICTURESQUE-LOOKING OLD MAN WITH LONG WHITE HAIR DROPPING DOWN OVER HIS COAT-COLLAR AND A BLACK-VELVET SKULL-CAP UPON HIS HEAD
I NEVER SET EYES UPON MR DUNBAR IN MY LIFE
FATE IS STRONGER THAN LOVE CLEMENT SHE SAID MOURNFULLY I CAN NEVER BE YOUR WIFE WHY NOT FOR A REASON WHICH YOU CAN NEVER KNOW MARGARET I WILL NOT SUBMIT YOU MUST SUBMIT THE GIRL SAID HOLDING UP HER HAND AS IF TO STOP HER LOVER'S PASSIONATE WORDS
I'M A MAN OF THE WORLD AND I CAN APPRECIATE THE EXACT VALUE OF THAT KIND OF TWADDLE
YOU HAVE MY GOOD WILL I ASSURE YOU
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT A VERY PLEASANT BUSINESS HE ADDED WITH A SIGH
I THOUGHT THIS WAS CRUEL AND COWARDLY
INELIGIBLE AS THAT SUITOR WAS IN A WORLDLY POINT OF VIEW
YOU'RE A CLEVER FELLOW DEAR FRIEND HE MUTTERED AS HE LIGHTED HIS CIGAR
AND HE DID NOT UTTER ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT ABOUT THAT AGGRAVATING WEATHER
THE FATHER SAT WITH HIS LONG CLAY PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING HIS DAUGHTER'S FAIR FACE AS SHE BENT OVER THE WORK UPON HER KNEE
HE'S LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD AND HE THINKS IF A MAN WEARS A SHABBY COAT HE MUST BE A SCOUNDREL
HE SAT WITH THE NEWSPAPER IN HIS HAND AND DID NOT DEIGN TO LIFT HIS EYES TO HIS COMPANION AFTER THAT FIRST BRIEF QUESTION
CHAMBERTIN OR CLOS DE VOUGEOT AT TWELVE BOB A BOTTLE--THAT'S THE SORT OF TIPPLE I RATHER FLATTER MYSELF--EH HENRY DUNBAR DREW HIMSELF UP WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER AS IF REPELLED AND DISGUSTED BY THE MAN'S VULGARITY
AND FROM THAT TIME HIS PENITENCE BEGAN
I REALLY NEVER SAW A CLEANER FRACTURE--NEVER I CAN ASSURE YOU BUT MR DUNBAR RAISED HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSITION IN SPITE OF THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS MEDICAL ATTENDANT AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT HIM
WHEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN--WHICH GENTLEMEN THEY BOTH WAS TO LOOK AT--CAME INTO OUR HALL THE ONE THAT WAS MURDERED HAD HIS COAT BUTTONED TIGHT ACROSS HIS CHEST EXCEPT ONE BUTTON
THE PRETTY CLAPHAM VILLA IS GAY WITH THE SOUND OF CHILDREN'S VOICES AND THE SHRILL CAROL OF SINGING BIRDS AND THE JOYOUS BARKING OF SKYE TERRIERS
UPON SUSPICION OF HAVING BEEN CONCERNED IN THE MURDER OF JOSEPH WILMOT THE MILLIONAIRE DREW HIMSELF UP HAUGHTILY AND LOOKED AT THE CONSTABLE WITH A PROUD SMILE
THE GIRL PUSHED IT OPEN AND FELL INTO THE ARMS OF A MAN WHO CAUGHT HER AS SHE FAINTED
AND I HAD LOST THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HER
WHILE HERE AND THERE HUNG THE ANTLERS OF A GIANT RED-DEER OR THE SKIN OF A FOX IN TESTIMONY TO THE TRIUMPHS OF LONG-DEPARTED SPORTSMEN OF THE HOUSE OF JOCELYN
HE WAS ABOUT TO VENTURE ON BOARD A STRANGE VESSEL WITH A CAPTAIN WHO BORE NO GOOD NAME AND WITH MEN WHO MOST LIKELY CLOSELY RESEMBLED THEIR MASTER
THE WEATHER GREW TOO COLD FOR THE DRAWING-LESSONS UNDER THE ELMS AND THERE COULD BE NO MORE APPOINTMENTS MADE BETWEEN MISS DUNBAR AND HER ENTHUSIASTIC INSTRUCTOR
WHEN YOU PAINTED PORTRAITS IN ENGLAND MR KERSTALL SHE SAID BEFORE YOU WENT TO ITALY YOU PAINTED A LIKENESS OF MY FATHER HENRY DUNBAR WHO WAS THEN A YOUNG MAN
I DARE SAY THE SOCIAL LEADER-WRITERS WERE RATHER HARD-UP FOR SUBJECTS AT THIS STAGNANT AUTUMNAL PERIOD AND WERE SCARCELY SORRY FOR THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF THE MAN IN THE GROVE
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN CLEMENT HEAVEN KNOWS MOTHER
YOU'RE NOT THE SURGEON WHO WAS ATTENDING HIM NO I'M EMPLOYED BY LADY JOCELYN
THE WEARER OF IT LOOKED VERY PRETTY AND ELEGANT HOWEVER BY THE LIGHT OF MRS AUSTIN'S WAX-CANDLES
THE LETTER WAS CAREFULLY WORDED AND VERY BRIEF
SHE HAD A THOROUGH-BRED HORSE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER BY HER GRANDFATHER BUT SHE VERY RARELY RODE HIM BEYOND THE GROUNDS FOR DORA MACMAHON WAS NO HORSEWOMAN HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP BY A PRIM AUNT OF HER DEAD MOTHER'S WHO LOOKED UPON RIDING AS AN UNFEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT
THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT SUITS ME
I HAD WITNESSED MY POOR GIRL'S PASSIONATE GRIEF AT JOSEPH WILMOT'S SUPPOSED DEATH
AND IN THE AFTERNOON THE DEAR SOUL ARRIVED AT KYLMINGTON TO EMBRACE HER FUTURE DAUGHTER
HE LOOKED BUT THERE WAS NO RAY OF RECOGNITION IN THAT LOOK
HE HAD THE PICTURE PAINTED FOR HIS MOTHER
THE OLD CLERK LOOKED NERVOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER'S FACE
DURING THE INTERVAL THAT ELAPSED BEFORE THE NEXT RACE HE TALKED TO A SOCIABLE BYSTANDER ABOUT SIR PHILIP JOCELYN AND THE YOUNG LADY HE WAS GOING TO MARRY
THERE'LL BE AN INQUEST AN INQUEST
I AM ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT MY FATHER WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM HOME FOR THE LAST WEEK OR TWO
HE HAD ALWAYS LACKED THAT SUBLIME QUALITY OF PATIENCE WHICH ENDURES THE EVIL DAY AND CALMLY BREASTS THE STORM
IN MY YOUNG DAYS IT WAS ONLY CONCERT-PLAYERS WHO PLAYED LIKE THAT
TO HER HE SEEMED INDEED THAT WHICH HE HAD PROMISED TO BE A BROTHER--KIND DEVOTED AFFECTIONATE
MEANWHILE EVERY VOICE IN WINCHESTER WAS LOUD IN INDIGNATION AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD CAUSED THE DETENTION OF THE MILLIONAIRE
EVER SINCE I FIRST KNEW THAT MY FATHER HAD BEEN MURDERED WHILE TRAVELLING WITH HENRY DUNBAR
THAT'S LUCKY
YOU WILL COME WITH ME LOVELL HE SAID
HEAVEN STRENGTHEN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO SPREAD CHRISTIAN ENLIGHTENMENT AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE LAND
THE THREE OTHER SHARES HAD BEEN DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS AND HAD LAPSED ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF PERCIVAL UPON THE DEATH OF HUGH
THE BANKER'S GAZE NEVER FLINCHED DURING THAT ENCOUNTER
AND IT IS AT THAT TIME IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED WHEN THE BREAST OF THE MURDERER IS LIKE A RAGING HELL
THE SHORTEST WAY FROM JOCELYN'S BOCK TO LISFORD WAS BY THE HIGH ROAD BUT PHILIP JOCELYN DID NOT CARE TO GO BY THE SHORTEST WAY
FOR YOU LOOK LIKE A DOOK CRIED THE TAILOR WITH ENTHUSIASM
ON THAT FIRST PAGE WAS WRITTEN IN HENRY DUNBAR'S BOLD LEGIBLE HAND JOURNAL OF MY LIFE IN INDIA FROM MY ARRIVAL IN 1815 UNTIL MY DEPARTURE IN 1850 THIS WAS THE BOOK THE BANKER HAD BEEN STUDYING ALL THAT WINTER'S DAY
A LARGE REWARD WAS OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE GUILTY MAN
I'VE GOT A LITTLE MATTER TO SETTLE WITH THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID INDICATING THE WINCHESTER CONSTABLE WITH A BACKWARD JERK OF HIS THUMB
A SAILING-VESSEL BOUND FOR COPENHAGEN
AND HE HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS AT A BOARDING-SCHOOL KEPT BY A CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN A FINE OLD BRICK MANSION ON THE LISFORD ROAD
A DRESSMAKER I DESSAY THE FOOTMAN THOUGHT
AND THEN--AND THEN THE HARD FACE THAT GREW HARDER WITH THE LAPSE OF YEARS
IN THE MEANWHILE LORD HERRISTON WROTE TO THE SOLICITOR YOUR SON CAN THINK THE MATTER OVER MY DEAR LOVELL AND MAKE HIS DECISION WITH ALL DUE DELIBERATION ARTHUR LOVELL HAD ALREADY MADE THAT DECISION
I WAS TEN YEARS YOUNGER ALL OF A SUDDEN AND MY HEART WAS ALL A-GLOW WITH CHIVALROUS DEVOTION FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL STRANGER
THE CHAMBERMAID WHO BROUGHT THE CANDLES ASKED IF HE HAD DINED
BUT HER EYES NEVER WANDERED FROM THE FINGERS IT WAS HER DUTY TO WATCH
BUT THEY SPOKE IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL WHISPERS AND THEIR CONVERSATION WAS INTERLARDED BY ALL MANNER OF STRANGE PHRASES
HER JOURNEYS HITHERTO HAD BEEN LONG WEARISOME PILGRIMAGES IN DRAUGHTY THIRD-CLASS CARRIAGES WITH NOISY COMPANY AND IN AN ATMOSPHERE PERVADED BY A POWERFUL EFFLUVIUM OF VARIOUS KINDS OF ALCOHOL
SHE WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL ALWAYS ARTHUR LOVELL THOUGHT
BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS NOT SO
I LOITERED ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL-YARD AND SAW THE MAN THAT WAS WITH CLEMENT GO AWAY DOWN BY THE MEADOWS TOWARDS THE GROVE TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE STOPPED AND TREMBLED SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK
BUT THE YOUNG MEN WERE VERY GOOD WATERMEN AND THEY WERE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF CAPTAIN SPELSAND OF THE CROW
IF MY MASTER HAS BETRAYED ME I HAVE NO WISH TO DENY ANYTHING
WILL YOU WRITE A NOTE TO MRS MARSTON SIR A NOTE
JAMES WENTWORTH HAD ONCE BEEN A HANDSOME MAN
HE PUT HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO THE BELT THAT WAS STRAPPED ROUND HIM AS MARGARET ASKED THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE MONEY
DID HE TELL YOU HE'D SEE YOU YES HE PROMISED TO SEE ME AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THAT'S UNCOMMON QUEER WHY SO ASKED MARGARET EAGERLY
PROUD OF HIS GENEROUS HEART WHICH BEATS WITH A THOUSAND KINDLY IMPULSES TOWARDS HIS FELLOW-MEN
FOR AS YOU KNOW WILMOT I DIDN'T COME INTO THE FIRM TILL TEN YEARS AFTER HE SAILED FOR INDIA
YOU FELT IT ONCE WHEN YOU WERE CHANGING YOUR MASTER'S SHIRT AND IT WAS ALL OVER LITTLE KNOBS AS HARD AS IRON BUT VERY SMALL
MR DUNBAR LEFT THE HABBEY UPPARDS OF A HOUR AGO THE FOOTMAN ANSWERED WITH SUPREME HAUTEUR
MR CARTER HANDED ME ONE OF THE WAX-CANDLES AND I SAT DOWN BEFORE THE LITTLE TABLE UNLOCKED MY DESK AND BEGAN TO WRITE A FEW LINES TO MY MOTHER
THE MAN CAME BACK IN FIVE MINUTES TO SAY YES LADY JOCELYN WOULD SEE THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN
HE TURNED SHARPLY ROUND AS UPON A PIVOT AND STARED AGHAST AT THE RETREATING FIGURE UNDER THE PORCH
NERVOUS PEOPLE DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
HENRY DUNBAR
THE REWARD AT STAKE WAS THEREFORE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS
A MAN WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH LOOKED OVER THE SIDE
AND HIS GLITTERING BLACK EYES KEPT PERPETUAL WATCH UPON THE FACES OF THE SIMPLE COUNTRY PEOPLE AND HIS EAGER EARS DRANK IN EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN
MY NAME IS DUNBAR THE CASHIER BOWED AND OPENED THE DOOR
THE CORONER AND THE JURYMEN LOOKED AT THAT DEAD FACE WITH WONDERING AWE-STRICKEN GLANCES
AND I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU IN THIS VERY TERRIBLE POSITION
DO YOU MEAN THIS AUSTIN HE SAID AT LAST
BUT QUESTION HIM HOW I MIGHT I COULD GET NOTHING FROM HIM EXCEPT THAT HE MEANT TO HAVE A SEARCH MADE FOR THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES
AND HE HAD STOOD GODFATHER--BY PROXY--TO HALF THE YELLOW-HEADED URCHINS WITHIN TEN MILES RADIUS OF JOCELYN'S BOCK
I WILL JUST GO AND SEE IF MY FATHER IS ABLE TO RECEIVE VISITORS
I'M THOROUGHLY UPSET BY ALL THIS
AND AS THIS YEAR HAPPENED FORTUNATELY TO BE USHERED INTO EXISTENCE BY A SHARP FROST AND A BRIGHT SUNNY SKY THE BOULEVARDS WERE NOT THE BLACK RIVERS OF MUD AND SLUSH THAT THEY ARE APT TO BE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THE INFANTINE YEAR
THE TWO GIRLS SAT AT THE TABLE BY THE FIRE AND BREAKFASTED OR PRETENDED TO BREAKFAST TOGETHER
HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN HANDSOME STILL BUT FOR THE MOODY DEFIANCE IN HIS EYES BUT FOR THE HALF-CONTEMPTUOUS CURVE OF HIS FINELY-MOULDED UPPER LIP
A YOUNG LADY WHO GAVE LESSONS ON THE PIANO-FORTE OR TAUGHT SINGING FOR VERY SMALL REMUNERATION
THE TWO MEN HAD GONE DOWN TOGETHER INTO THAT SILENT GROVE THE SERVANT HAD THREATENED HIS PATRON THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND NO
I DO REMEMBER YOU HENRY DUNBAR SAID SLOWLY
HOW IS IT THAT YOU LEFT HER CLEMENT DID NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION
BUT WHO ARE YOU THEN I WILL TELL YOU PRESENTLY SIR
OUT WITH IT
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR PAPA AND BRING HIM TO YOU IN TRIUMPH
BUT THOUGH GRISELDA'S YELLOW HAIR FELL DOWN TO HER WAIST IN GLOSSY RIPPLING CURLS THAT SHONE LIKE MOLTEN GOLD
INSIDE THE WHITE SHIRT THERE WAS A FLANNEL SHIRT OUT OF WHICH THERE ROLLED HALF-A-DOZEN HEAVY STONES
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING OF YOU CONFOUNDED FOOL HE SAID
THE TWO MEN WENT INTO THE GROVE ARM-IN-ARM
HE HANDED ME THE BILL WITHOUT SPEAKING AND WHEN I HAD LOOKED AT IT HE SAID YOUR BROTHER IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS BUSINESS SAMPSON
SOMETHING OF A DREAMER
WE FOUND THE MAN WITH THE DRAGS WAITING FOR US UNDER THE DRIPPING TREES
BUT THE GHASTLY LOOK OF FEAR AND HORROR WAS NEW UPON HIS FACE
FIRST THE STUPIDITY OF GUILT THE BLIND BESOTTED FOLLY WHICH SO OFTEN BETRAYS THE MURDERER
THE DESOLATE GIRL REMEMBERED THAT NIGHT UPON WHICH SHE HAD FIRST HEARD OF THE MURDER AND SHE REMEMBERED THE SYMPATHY THAT MR AUSTIN HAD EVINCED ON THAT OCCASION
I RARELY HEAR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
BUT THE PAPERS GAVE NO TIDINGS OF JOSEPH WILMOT
THEY HAD RETURNED TO PARIS FOR THE EARLY NEW YEAR
I'M SURE I WOULDN'T SAY ANY THING DISRESPECTFUL AGAINST MR DUNBAR
THE TRAIN BY WHICH HE TRAVELLED STOPPED AT EVERY STATION
SHE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER OUT UPON THE SUNLIT LAWN ALL GORGEOUS WITH FLAUNTING AUTUMN FLOWERS
I MUST OWN MR DUNBAR THAT I CANNOT SEE THE LIKENESS I DARE SAY NOT THE BANKER ANSWERED CARELESSLY
BESIDES I AM NOT SUCH A GRANDEE THAT I NEED LOOK FOR HIGH LINEAGE IN THE WIFE OF MY CHOICE
AND WHO HAS NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT TO WAIT PATIENTLY TILL THE SLOW CURRENT OF HIS EMPTY LIFE DROPS INTO THE SEA OF DEATH
BUT THE CASHIER SCARCELY LOOKED AT THESE
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE DOCKS AND MADE INQUIRIES ABOUT THE STEAMER ELECTRA
SHE IS A VERY YOUNG LADY BEING IN POINT OF FACT STILL AT A REMOTE DISTANCE FROM AN EPOCH TO WHICH SHE APPEARS TO LOOK FORWARD AS A GRAND AND ENVIABLE PERIOD OF EXISTENCE
DORA AND I HAVE BEEN MISERABLE HAVEN'T WE DORA
THE SULLEN SCOWL WAS NOW A THOUGHTFUL FROWN
ALL THIS DAY'S LABOUR AND WEARINESS HAS BEEN SO MUCH WASTED TROUBLE I SAID
FOR YOU SEE THERE'S LITTLE FACKS AS ONE PERSON WILL NOTICE AND AS ANOTHER WON'T NOTICE AND IT ISN'T A MAN'S PLACE TO COME FORWARD WITH EVERY LITTLE TRIVIAL THING YOU SEE SIR
BUT LAURA DUNBAR DID NOT TROUBLE HERSELF TO THINK ABOUT THIS
WELL I REALLY DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO IF YOU WISH TO DO SO HE SAID PRESENTLY
WHILE HENRY DUNBAR SAT IN HIS LONELY ROOM AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY HELD PRISONER BY HIS BROKEN LEG AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE HOUR IN WHICH HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING HIS FIRST EXPERIMENTAL PROMENADE UPON CRUTCHES SIR PHILIP JOCELYN AND HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE DROVE TOGETHER ON THE CROWDED BOULEVARDS OF THE FRENCH CAPITAL
THE SKY THAT SHUTS IN THE LAWN YONDER SEEMS TO SHUT IN MY LIFE WITH IT
HE HAD INJURED THE MAN AND IT WAS IN THE MAN'S POWER TO DO HIM INJURY
YOU MAY AS WELL BRING YOUR CHEQUE-BOOK WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT FOR THIS SORT OF THING IS APT TO COME RATHER EXPENSIVE CHAPTER XXXVIII
OTHER LABOURERS BESIDES THE TWO IRISHMEN HAD PASSED BENEATH THE SHADOW OF THE TREES IN THE MOONLIGHT
BUT MY YOUNG LADY ISN'T HALF DRESSED YET
I DARE SAY HE DID MUTTERED MR CARTER
HIS EMPLOYERS HEARD SOMETHING
THE VERIEST CHURL COULD SCARCELY HAVE ASSOCIATED VICE OR FALSEHOOD WITH SUCH A LOVELY AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME BRINGS YOU HERE AT SUCH AN HOUR AS THIS DANGER ANSWERED THE GIRL BREATHLESSLY
PERCIVAL DUNBAR GLADLY PAID THREE THOUSAND POUNDS AS THE PRICE OF HIS SON'S HONOUR
AND MR CARTER HAD ENOUGH WORK TO DO IN SQUEEZING HIMSELF INTO THE INTERIOR OF THESE RECEPTACLES WHICH ALL SMELT MORE OR LESS OF CHANDLERY AND RUM,--THAT TRULY SEAMAN-LIKE SPIRIT HAVING BEEN A FAVOURITE BEVERAGE WITH THE LATE INHABITANT OF THE COTTAGE
EH DEAR BOY I DON'T REFUSE TO DO IT DO I ASKED HENRY DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY
THE DETECTIVE ORDERED A SUBSTANTIAL BREAKFAST WITH A COUPLE OF GLASSES OF PALE BRANDY NEAT TO BEGIN WITH
BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME HIDDEN ANIMOSITY SOME SMOTHERED FEELING STRONGER THAN ANY OPENLY-EXPRESSED ANGER HIDDEN IN YOUR BREAST
CHAPTER XLII
A WET WEDDING IS LIKE A WET PIC-NIC
SAMPSON WILMOT TURNED AND LOOKED HIM FULL IN THE FACE
BUT IF I GO NEAR HER SHE SHIVERS AND GIVES A LONG SHUDDERING SIGH
YES IT WAS A PARCEL--A SMALL OBLONG BOX--ABOUT THE SIZE OF THOSE PASTEBOARD RECEPTACLES WHICH ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SEIDLITZ POWDERS--AN OBLONG BOX NEATLY PACKED IN WHITE PAPER SECURED WITH SEVERAL SEALS AND ADDRESSED TO CLEMENT AUSTIN ESQ WILLOW BANK CLAPHAM
DO YOU MEAN THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAS ESCAPED
WHILE THESE THINGS WERE TAKING PLACE AT WINCHESTER MARGARET WAITED FOR THE COMING OF HER FATHER
SIR PHILIP MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO MUCH DEVOTED TO HORSES AND DOGS AND LAURA MAY HAVE BEEN A SHADE TOO ENTHUSIASTIC UPON THE SUBJECT OF NEW BONNETS AND THE JEWELLERY IN THE RUE DE LA PAIX
THIS IS TOO ABSURD HE SAID
AND THE MOUTH--THAT TELL-TALE FEATURE OVER WHOSE EXPRESSION NO MAN HAS PERFECT CONTROL--BETRAYED THAT THE BANKER HAD SUFFERED
NO POWER ON EARTH WILL EVER INDUCE ME TO TAKE A SIXPENCE FROM THAT MAN'S HAND WHY NOT YOU KNOW WHY NOT
THAT I COULDN'T GET A SEAT IN THE OMNIBUS AND WAS COMPELLED TO TAKE A HANSOM WHICH COST ME TWO SHILLINGS
ANY PLACE THAT THERE'S A VESSEL READY TO TAKE HIM
THE MAIL LEAVES WINCHESTER AT A QUARTER BEFORE ELEVEN ADDED MR CARTER LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AS HE SPOKE
IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE DOLPHIN HOTEL
AND PHILIP JOCELYN CEASED TO GO TO LISFORD AT ALL CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH PASSING ALMOST EVERY FINE MORNING UNDER THE ELMS AT MAUDESLEY
YOUR GRAN'PA WOULD HAVE GONE AFTER YOU TO THE REMOTEST END OF THIS WORLD MISS LAURA IF YOU'D SO MUCH AS HELD YOUR FINGER UP TO BECKON OF HIM
HAVE SOME PITY UPON ME CLEMENT AUSTIN AND LEAVE ME
VERY WELL
THE INQUEST WAS CONCLUDED TO-DAY
THEY'D BE ALL ON THE QUI VIVE DIRECTLY THEY FOUND OUT WHO I WAS AND WHAT I WAS AFTER AND THEY'D TRY TO HELP ME
THE MURDERED MAN WAS CONNECTED WITH ME
HE ORDERED THE CABMAN TO DRIVE STRAIGHT TO A STREET LEADING OUT OF HOLBORN A VERY QUIET-LOOKING STREET WHERE YOU COULD BUY DIAMONDS ENOUGH TO SET UP ALL THE JEWELLERS IN THE PALAIS ROYALE AND THE RUE DE LA PAIX AND WHERE IF YOU WERE SO WHIMSICAL AS TO WISH TO TRANSFORM A SERVICE OF PLATE INTO WHITE SOUP AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE YOU MIGHT INDULGE YOUR FANCY IN ESTABLISHMENTS OF UNBLEMISHED RESPECTABILITY
NO NO MY DEAR HE SAID
HIS FACE WAS WIZEN AND WRINKLED HIS FADED BLUE EYES DIM AND WEAK-LOOKING
YOU MUST NOT WONDER IF THIS GIRL IS UNREASONABLE
THE STONE WALLS WERE THICK AND MASSIVE THE LANCET-HEADED WINDOWS WERE LONG AND NARROW AND THE ARMS OF THE EARLY BENEFACTORS OF THE MONASTERY WERE EMBLAZONED HERE AND THERE UPON THE RICHLY STAINED GLASS
AND HAD NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BUT WORDS OF LOVE AND TENDERNESS
AND ALL THE OTHER USELESS LITTER OF AN ARTIST'S STUDIO
FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
HE HAD LEFT THE SAME TOWN CHIEF PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY AND SOLE OWNER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY THE YORKSHIRE ESTATES AND THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE
AND YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS I SUPPOSE MR AUSTIN I AM PROVE YOUR FRIENDSHIP THEN BY TEACHING MARGARET WILMOT THAT SHE HAS A FRIEND AND NOT AN ENEMY IN ME
SHE IS ACCUSTOMED TO GO ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE SAYS AFTER DARK AS WELL AS IN THE DAYTIME
IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING
IT WAS A LARGE HOUSE
LET ME GET INTO THE CAB WITH YOU MR H.D AND TAKE ME BACK TO THE CASA AND GIVE ME A COMFORTABLE LITTLE BIT OF PERROGG
CAN YOU TELL US THE EXACT SPOT AT WHICH YOU PARTED WITH THE DECEASED ASKED THE CORONER
BUT IF SO WHERE WAS HE
MARGARET'S FATHER III
OR AM I DREAMING ALL THIS IT IS NO DREAM MR AUSTIN
HENRY DUNBAR LOOKED AT THE DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
FOR SHE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN SO HARD-HEARTED AS TO LEAVE IT UNANSWERED
AND THEN BROUGHT THE DESK OR RATHER DESPATCH-BOX WHICH HAD COST FORTY POUNDS AND WAS PROVIDED WITH EVERY POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE FOR A BUSINESS MAN AND EVERY ELEGANT LUXURY THAT THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT TRAVELLER COULD DESIRE
THERE'S HEART IN IT SIR IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSION
PALER AND THINNER THAN MR DUNBAR REPEATED THE DETECTIVE
THE PORTER UPON THE OTHER HAND WAS VERY COMMUNICATIVE
I WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE READ MY THOUGHTS IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
I HEAR THAT MR DUNBAR HAS BEEN DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY
IT SEEMED AS IF THE OLD CLERK'S PHILOSOPHY WAS NOT SO VERY UNSOUND AFTER ALL
THAT MR DUNBAR HAD SHOWN VERY GREAT CONCERN AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF HIS COMPANION AND HAD DECLINED TO EAT HIS DINNER UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK
MR CARTER ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO SAIL SO SOON
IT MAY BE THAT HE WAS GLAD THE WORST HAD COME
BUT JOSEPH WILMOT STILL SAT WITH A FULL GLASS BEFORE HIM
FOR THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE TO SUCCEED HENRY DUNBAR AND MR JOHN LOVELL HAD SOLD THE DEAD MAN'S INTEREST ON BEHALF OF HIS CLIENT LADY JOCELYN
MRS AUSTIN GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONGST HER GUESTS TO ASCERTAIN THE CURRENT OF OPINIONS FOUND THAT HER PROTEGEE'S SUCCESS WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT BEFORE THE EVENING WAS OVER
OR STAY YOU'LL DO AS WELL I DARE SAY
THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU
HE BROKE HIS WORD AND LEFT WINCHESTER WITHOUT SEEING ME
IT WAS AS HANDSOME AS HIS OWN AND ALMOST AS ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING
BUT SEEING A VERY BLACK AND OMINOUS EXPRESSION UPON THE FACE OF HIS PATIENT HE CONTRIVED TO MODIFY THE RADIANCE OF HIS OWN COUNTENANCE
WE SHALL BE ALONGSIDE OF HER IN AN HOUR ONE OF THE MEN SAID
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOUR SAKE
OUR PATIENT IS BY NO MEANS AN ORDINARY PERSON SHE HAS A VERY STRONG WILL MARGARET HAS A STRONG WILL EXCLAIMED CLEMENT WITH A LOOK OF SURPRISE
MY POOR GIRL I CANNOT POSSIBLY MOVE IN THIS BUSINESS UPON SUCH EVIDENCE AS THIS
SHE MET MY FATHER AT THE HOUSE OF A LADY FROM WHOM SHE USED TO RECEIVE MUSIC-LESSONS
MR BALDERBY WENT TO THE OFFICE TO PROCURE THE THREE TICKETS
BUT HE COULD NOT DO SO
THERE'S A COPPER COAL-SCUTTLE OF THE OLD ADMIRAL'S AS MY WIFE HAS GOT RATHER A FANCY FOR
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I WAS TOLD AFTERWARDS THAT THE ONE WHO WAS MURDERED WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A VALET YOU'RE NOT GETTING ON VERY FAST WITH YOUR LETTERS SAID MR CARTER LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT ME
AT PORTLAND PLACE WHO'S LAURA D MUSED THE SPY AS HE CLOSED THE MEMORANDUM-BOOK
I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO BE OF ANY USE TO YOU IN THE MATTER ALL I WANT IS A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AT MY COMMAND
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF FEAR EITHER IN THE FACE OR MANNER OF HENRY DUNBAR
BUT HENRY DUNBAR WAVED HIM OFF WITH AN AUTHORITATIVE GESTURE
AND WITHIN THIS CLOISTERED COURTWAY MR DUNBAR HAD ERECTED THE LOOSE BOX FOR HIS FAVOURITE HORSE
WE DID NOT LIVE BY ANY MEANS A SECLUDED OR GLOOMY LIFE FOR MY MOTHER WAS FOND OF PLEASANT SOCIETY
MY FATHER GOT SOME EMPLOYMENT
NO THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
SHE WAS SITTING AT THE SAME WINDOW BY WHICH SHE HAD SAT WHEN ARTHUR LOVELL ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE
BUT HE TURNED HIS FACE AWAY AND SIGHED
YOU CAN FOLLOW ME IN A DAY OR TWO WITH SOME MORE THINGS YES SIR THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS BUSTLE AND CONFUSION IN A HOUSEHOLD ORGANIZED LIKE THAT OF MR DUNBAR
I WANT TO SEE MR DUNBAR HE SAID ON PARTICULAR BUSINESS
LET HER BE SENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS THE WAITER HESITATED
BUT HOW SO I ASKED
THE WAX-CANDLES WERE LIGHTED THE CRIMSON CURTAINS WERE DRAWN BEFORE THE BOW-WINDOW AND THE ROOM LOOKED ALTOGETHER VERY COMFORTABLE
LET MY DAUGHTER KNOW THAT I SHALL NOT COME TO LONDON FOR SOME DAYS ALL THIS TIME THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN LAY ON A LONG TABLE IN A DARKENED CHAMBER AT THE FORESTERS ARMS
THEN HIS MIND BEGAN TO GROW CONFUSED
IT WAS A NOBLE OLD HOUSE
HE BROUGHT THESE TO A TABLE BY THE SIDE OF HIS FATHER'S EASEL AND ONE BY ONE HE WIPED THEM CLEAN WITH A LARGE RAGGED SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND THEN PLACED THEM ON THE EASEL
BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THOSE SECRETS WERE
HE WAS A GENTLEMANLY CREATURE VERY SELDOM DEMONSTRATIVE IN HIS MANNER AND HE WISHED TO TAKE LIFE PLEASANTLY
I SHALL NOT LEAVE WINCHESTER WITHOUT JOSEPH WILMOT I'M SURE IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU SIR THE LANDLORD MURMURED
CLEMENT SEATED HIMSELF AT THE DINNER-TABLE IN DEFERENCE TO HIS MOTHER AND WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF DINNER
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THAT HE HAD NOT LEARNED MORE OR LESS IN TWENTY YEARS KNOCKING ABOUT THE WORLD
THE GROINED CEILING WAS OF OAK THAT HAD GROWN BLACK WITH AGE
DON'T APPROACH ME
MY COMPANION WAS VERY SILENT AND I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS STILL THINKING
IT WAS A NOBLE PLACE AND HAD BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SAME FAMILY EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF THE PLANTAGENETS
YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE CLERKS IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE HE SAID
AND IF THAT PRIMITIVE WARWICKSHIRE VILLAGE HAD BEEN THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE UPON THIS EARTH SIR PHILIP COULD SCARCELY HAVE VISITED IT OFTENER THAN HE DID
FOR IT WAS A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I HAD HAD A DAY'S LEISURE AND THE ACCUMULATION OF LETTERS BILLS AND RECEIPTS WAS SOMETHING VERY FORMIDABLE
I FEEL SO OLD MOTHER HE SAID SOMETIMES
BUT I AM READY TO DO WHAT YOU WISH MR BALDERBY
YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME MARGARET I CRIED THE GIRL LOOKING AT HER FATHER
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MASTER GOT IT EH
DON'T FLINCH GIRL
NO MR DUNBAR ANSWERED
WHEN THE WOMAN I HAVE LOVED AND BELIEVED IN TURNS UPON ME AND COOLLY TELLS ME THAT SHE MEANS TO BREAK MY HEART WITHOUT SO MUCH AS DEIGNING TO GIVE ME A REASON FOR HER CONDUCT I AM NOT SO MUCH A GENTLEMAN AS TO BE ABLE TO SMILE POLITELY AND REQUEST HER TO PLEASE HERSELF THE CASHIER TURNED AWAY FROM MARGARET AND WALKED TWO AT THREE TIMES UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
YOU WERE VERY BADLY TREATED--CRUELLY AND UNJUSTLY TREATED--NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN I
BUT HE DID NOT
I HAVE NOT LED A VERY SOBER LIFE OF LATE YEARS
WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND WAS ABLE TO THINK STEADILY OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED I HAD BUT ONE FEELING IN MY MIND
ALL I WANT IS A COMFORTABLE LITTLE PLACE THAT I CAN JUMP INTO WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE TO MYSELF MAJOR VERNON SAID WITH THE AIR OF A MAN OF THE WORLD
I HAVE NO NEED TO WRITE A MINUTE RECORD OF THAT MISERABLE DAY
WAS IT ONE OF THE ROSE-AND-CROWN FLIES D'YE THINK OH YES THE FLY BELONGED TO LISFORD
NEW HOPES MAY BLOOM
IT WAS LOVE MARGARET
AND I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCARCELY SURPRISED TO SEE ALADDIN'S JEWELLED FRUIT HANGING ON THE TREES IN THE VILLA GARDENS OR THE GIGANTIC WINGS OF SINBAD'S ROC OVERSHADOWING THE HILLS OF SYDENHAM
HER LIPS QUIVERED AND THE TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
OF ALL THE HAZARDOUS VENTURES IN WHICH THE DETECTIVE HAD BEEN ENGAGED THIS WAS CERTAINLY NOT THE LEAST HAZARDOUS
I GOT UP EARLY BECAUSE--BECAUSE--I AM GOING AWAY HER TWO HANDS HAD BEEN HANGING LOOSELY AMONGST THE FRINGES OF HER SHAWL
WAS THIS GENTLE GIRL'S RESOLUTION TO OVERRULE A STRONG MAN'S PASSIONATE VEHEMENCE
HE GOT OFF HIS HIGH SEAT AS MR DUNBAR ENTERED AND LOOKED RATHER SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE BANKER
SHE WOULD SEE HENRY DUNBAR
HE HAD VISITED MAUDESLEY ABBEY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE LIFETIME OF PERCIVAL DUNBAR FOR HE HAD BEEN A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD MAN
THE DRIVER WAS COLD AND CROSS BUT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO SHORNCLIFFE AND HE DROVE VERY FAST
I SHALL COME BACK TO-MORROW NIGHT I DARE SAY AS I'VE ONLY THREE DAYS LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE MY MOTHER WHO HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE REFUSED ME ANYTHING DID NOT LONG OPPOSE ME TO-DAY
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU AT THE CLARENDON IF YOU WILL DINE WITH ME ANY EVENING THAT YOU ARE DISENGAGED THERE WAS VERY LITTLE HEARTINESS IN THE TONE OF THIS INVITATION
THERE WAS A BOW-WINDOW QUITE LARGE ENOUGH FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF A SMALL FAMILY AND MRS AUSTIN SETTLED HERSELF THERE WHILE THE LANDLORD WAS STRUGGLING WITH A REFRACTORY FIRE AND PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW THAT THE GRATE WAS DAMP
I WILL SUFFER NO IMAGINARY BARRIER TO STAND BETWEEN YOU AND ME
HE DINED DRANK THE BEST PART OF A BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY AND THEN ORDERED A CUP OF STRONG TEA TO BE TAKEN TO HIS DRESSING-ROOM
GO
AND AS SIR PHILIP JOCELYN IS A RICH MAN SHE WILL PERHAPS BE ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST WOMEN IN ENGLAND
HE RANG THE BELL WENT INTO THE PARK AND RAN ALONG THE AVENUE TO THE PERCH
SHE WALKED FOR SOME DISTANCE WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE SHE WENT THEN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED
BUT WHEN CLEMENT LOOKED DISAPPOINTED THE GOOD SOUL'S HEART MELTED ALL IN A MOMENT AND SHE DECLARED THAT IF MARGARET WAS ONLY AS GOOD AS SHE WAS PRETTY AND TRULY ATTACHED TO HER DEAR NOBLE-HEARTED BOY SHE MRS AUSTIN WOULD ASK NO MORE
LOR BLESS YOUR INNOCENCE SIR
HE MARRIED WELL OF COURSE
I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO YOU SIR AND I DON'T WANT TO THINK BADLY OF YOU AT PARTING
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE RAILWAY STATION AND MADE INQUIRIES AS TO THE TRAINS
WILL YOU PLEASE STEP INTO YOUR FATHER'S ROOM SIR I SAID
YOU CAN LEAVE LONDON BY THE AFTERNOON TRAIN WHICH STARTS AT FOUR O'CLOCK
THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE WAITING FOR PASSENGERS WHO WERE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE BY THE ELECTRA AND THE COMING OF THE STEAMER WAS HAILED BY A FEEBLE CHEER FROM THE BYSTANDERS GROUPED ABOUT THE LANDING-PLACE
PERHAPS IN THE HOPE THAT IN MY EAGER CURIOSITY I MIGHT IMMEDIATELY OPEN THE PACKET AND GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY OF SATISFYING HER OWN DESIRE FOR INFORMATION
BUT AS THE FISHERMAN LIFTED HIS HAND TO GRASP IT HE UTTERED A SUDDEN CRY AND RAISED THE OTHER HAND WITH A SPLASH OUT OF THE WATER
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD GIVEN HIM THE SLIP--FOR THE TIME AT LEAST
IT WAS A FORCED SMILE PERHAPS
HIS FINGERS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HE DID SO AND HE DROPPED HIS HAND SUDDENLY UPON THE LEDGER
JOSEPH WILMOT WALKED UP TO IT LOOKED AT HIMSELF FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN SILENT CONTEMPLATION AND THEN SHOOK HIS CLENCHED HAND AT THE REFLECTED IMAGE
WHEN HE HAD DRUNK A CUP OF TEA HE TOOK OUT THE LOCKET CONTAINING LAURA'S MINIATURE AND SAT SILENTLY CONTEMPLATING IT
EVIL TREES BEAR EVIL FRUIT MR BALDERBY
NOTHING COULD HAVE BETTER PLEASED THE NEW INHABITANT OF WOODBINE COTTAGE WHO WAS SPEEDILY ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH HIS HOUSEKEEPER
HE WILL SCOLD ME WHEN HE COMES HOME AND HEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN SO UPON THE EVENING OF THE 27TH AUGUST MARGARET GAVE HER ACCUSTOMED LESSON AND LINGERED A LITTLE AS USUAL AFTER THE LESSON TALKING TO MRS AUSTIN WHO HAD TAKEN A WONDERFUL FANCY TO HER GRANDDAUGHTER'S MUSIC-MISTRESS
HE WAS GETTING WHAT HA CALLED PECKISH NOW AND WAS JUST GOING TO THE COFFEE-ROOM OF THE VICTORIA HOTEL WITH THE INTENTION OF ORDERING A STEAK AND A GLASS OF BRANDY-AND-WATER--MR CARTER NEVER TOOK BEER WHICH IS A SLEEPY BEVERAGE INIMICAL TO THAT PERPETUAL CLEARNESS OF INTELLECT NECESSARY TO A DETECTIVE--WHEN HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND WALKED BACK TO THE EDGE OF THE QUAY TO PROWL ALONG ONCE MORE WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING AT THE VESSELS AND TO TAKE ANOTHER INSPECTION OF THE DECK AND CAPTAIN OF THE CROW
GOOD-BYE MOTHER
BUT SHE HAD GIVEN THAT PROMISE VERY RELUCTANTLY AND ONLY UPON ONE CONDITION
THOUGH YOU ARE NOT AS BRIGHT AS USUAL TO-DAY MADGE MRS AUSTIN ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
THE NORTHERN EXPRESS HAD SUFFERED MUCH LESS
HAD THE GIRL TOLD HIM THE TRUTH
IF YOU EVER FOLLERED A LAME EEL--AND A LAME EEL AS MAKES NO MORE OF ITS LAMENESS THAN IF LAMENESS WAS A ADVANTAGE--YOU'D KNOW WHAT IT IS TO FOLLER THAT CHAP IN THE FURRED COAT THE DETECTIVE HOOKED HIS ARM THROUGH THAT OF HIS ASSISTANT AND LED MR TIBBLES OUT OF THE STATION BY A DOOR WHICH OPENED ON A DESOLATE REGION AT THE BACK OF THAT BUILDING
AND I DO NOT THINK TWO HAPPIER PEOPLE EVER SAT SIDE BY SIDE IN THE LATE AUTUMN SUNSHINE THAN THOSE TWO WHO LINGERED IN THE DEEP EMBAYED WINDOW TILL THE SUN WAS LOW IN THE ROSY WESTERN SKY AND TOLD PHILIP JOCELYN THAT HIS VISIT TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY HAD VERY MUCH EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF A MORNING CALL
THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO DWELL UPON THE HISTORY OF THIS COURTSHIP
I WILL SEND A WOMAN TO NURSE HIM
CHAPTER IV
SHE HAD GOOD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT WENTWORTH WAS A FALSE ONE
I SHALL SIT UP TWO OR THREE HOURS AND SEE HOW THE POOR GIRL GOES ON CLEMENT THE WIDOW SAID
HOWEVER I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE YOU TO BE AN HONEST CONSCIENTIOUS FELLOW AND I WILL TRUST YOU
CHAPTER VI
I NEVER SAW HENRY DUNBAR MR BALDERBY SAID
THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY ARTHUR LOVELL WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON WITH NO VERY GREAT FAVOUR
I'VE GOT A LETTER FROM THE JUNIOR PARTNER THERE AND I'M TO DELIVER IT TO MR DUNBAR HIMSELF THE KEEPER OF THE LODGE THREW UP HER HANDS AND EYES IN TOKEN OF UTTER BEWILDERMENT
I CAN SEE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR FACE
AND THE UNBIDDEN TEARS CLOUDED HER EYES
IF SHE DOES NOT HE DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE EVEN IN HIS OWN MIND
CLEMENT AUSTIN MAKES A SACRIFICE
2D ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX POUNDS SEVENTEEN SHILLINGS AND TWOPENCE
CLEMENT STOOD LOOKING AT HER FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
SHE WOULD HAVE DRUNK LIVING FIRE IF BY SO DOING SHE COULD HAVE GAINED STRENGTH TO COMPLETE HER TASK
NO REPENTANCE WAS EVER MORE SINCERE CLEMENT SHE SAID FOR SHE SEEMED AFRAID WE SHOULD DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF PENITENCE IN SUCH A CRIMINAL AS JOSEPH WILMOT
THEN HE BOWED GRAVELY TO MARGARET AND WISHED HER GOOD MORNING AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM
THERE WILL BE NO HIDEOUS RECOLLECTION INTERWOVEN WITH MY IMAGE NOW I THOUGHT
AND HE IS ALSO READY TO GIVE YOU PERMANENT HELP IF YOU REQUIRE IT HE OPENED HENRY DUNBAR'S PURSE AS HE SPOKE BUT THE GIRL ROSE AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH ICY DISDAIN IN HER FIXED WHITE FACE
THE PRETTY POLLY WENT BACK TO THE PORT OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL IN THE GREY MORNING LIGHT CARRYING MR CARTER VERY COLD AND VERY DOWN-HEARTED--NOT TO SAY HUMILIATED--BY HIS FAILURE
MR KERSTALL SENIOR SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY IN POSSESSION OF ALL HIS FACULTIES WHILE HE HELD FORTH UPON MODERN ART THAT LAURA BEGAN TO HOPE HIS MEMORY COULD SCARCELY BE SO MUCH IMPAIRED AS HIS SON HAD REPRESENTED IT TO BE
I'M GLAD OF IT I'M GLAD OF IT HE MUTTERED
HEAVEN HAVE PITY UPON THE WRETCH SO LOST AS TO BE SEPARATED FROM HIS FELLOW-CREATURES BY REASON OF THE VILENESS OF HIS NATURE
MY POOR LITTLE LAURA HE MURMURED
A WEEK AFTER I HAD READ OF THIS MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE MR CARTER MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT CLAPHAM VERY GRAVE OF ASPECT AND DEJECTED OF MANNER
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO DO THIS
HIS LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE ALTOGETHER SLIPPED AWAY FROM HIM AND HE FELT LIKE AN OLD MAN WHO HAS LOST ALL THE BRIGHT CHANCES OF EXISTENCE
BUT LEAVE ME NOW
WE SEEM TO BE OLD FRIENDS
BUT HE HAD NOT TALKED SO MUCH OR SO LOUDLY AS JOSEPH WILMOT
SHE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH UPON ORDINARY OCCASIONS
THE REWARD WHICH GOVERNMENT HAD OFFERED FOR THE ARREST OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S MURDERER WAS THE LEGITIMATE PRICE USUALLY BIDDEN FOR THE HEAD OF AN ASSASSIN
BUT HASTENED IT MAY BE BY THAT UNLOOKED-FOR MEETING AT THE WATERLOO TERMINUS
NOT BUT WHAT I'M THANKFUL TO YOU FOR GIVING ME YOUR HELP AND I SHALL ESTEEM IT A FAVOUR IF YOU'LL ACCEPT A TRIFLE TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR LOST DAY
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T MEET MR DUNBAR
YOU'RE A DETECTIVE OFFICER ARE YOU?--A KNOWING CARD OF COURSE
LOOK ME IN THE FACE MADGE DARLING AND TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME BUT THE BLUSHING FACE WOULD NOT BE TURNED TOWARDS HIS OWN
IF YOU WILL COME AND DRINK TEA WITH MY MOTHER AT EIGHT O'CLOCK TO-MORROW EVENING I WILL BE AT HOME
AND I'M TOLD THE YOUNG PEOPLE CALL THAT A SKY
I TOLD HIM THEN OF OUR JOURNEY TO SHORNCLIFFE AND MARGARET'S STRANGE CONDUCT AFTER HER INTERVIEW WITH THE MAN SHE HAD BEEN SO EAGER TO SEE
THE LEGEND WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT THE WHITE WRAITH OF THE INNOCENT VICTIM MIGHT BE SEEN ON A CERTAIN NIGHT IN THE YEAR RISING OUT OF THE MISTY SPRAY OF THE WATERFALL
HE LAID DOWN THE VOLUME ON THE TABLE WHILE HE REPLACED OTHER PAPERS IN THE BOX AND IT FELL OPEN AT THE FIRST PAGE
HE SEEMED TO THINK THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THE MURDERED MAN OUGHT TO BE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER DIFFERENT FROM OTHER YOUNG WOMEN
IT WAS QUITE A CHAMBER OF HORRORS MR KERSTALL THE YOUNGER SAID GAILY
FROM THE STATELY HOUSEKEEPER IN RUSTLING SILKEN ROBES TO THE SMALLEST BOY EMPLOYED IN THE STABLES
I CAN PAY FOR WHAT I WANT
HE'LL GET ON BOARD THE FIRST THAT SAILS
AND I WANT YOU TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT THE ARTISTS AND WHAT I OUGHT TO ADMIRE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING SIR PHILIP NEVER REFUSED HIS WIFE ANYTHING
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY CHILDREN AND ENGLISH NURSEMAIDS
THEY ARE ONLY MASTERS WHEN THE COWARD CALLS THEM
THE OLD MAN COULD REMEMBER HIS BROTHER'S WORDS
WELL HE DID HIS BEST AND HAD A FINE VOLUME OF RICH BASS VOICE THAT SOUNDED REMARKABLY WELL ON THE WATER AFTER A DINNER AT THE STAR AND GARTER IN THAT DIM DEWY HOUR WHEN THE WILLOW SHADOWED THAMES IS AS A SOUTHERN LAKE AND THE SLOW DIP OF THE OARS IS IN ITSELF A KIND OF MELODY
BUT HER MEDITATIONS MUST HAVE BEEN OF A PLEASANT NATURE FOR THERE WAS A SMILE UPON HER FACE
I AM GETTING SERIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THIS MAN MR DUNBAR EXCLAIMED AT LAST
HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD BENT FORWARD UPON HIS BREAST AND SEEMED AS IF HE DARE NOT LIFT HIS EYES TO HIS UNCLE'S FACE
I THOUGHT AS MUCH HE MUTTERED
I WILL GO TO MY FATHER'S MURDERER
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME ARTHUR SHE SAID
THE BELL'S RINGING--I'LL COME WITH YOU THE TRAIN WAS ON THE POINT OF STARTING
YES QUITE THE SAME
DO YOU THINK MY HEART IS NOT AS MUCH ENGAGED IN ANYTHING THAT MAY INFLUENCE YOUR FATE AS EVEN YOUR OWN CAN BE
THERE SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR BELIEF ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT A MAN WITH A MILLION OF MONEY CAN DO NO WRONG
THE HALL BELOW WAS CROWDED BY THE SERVANTS OF THE PLACE AND BY EAGER STRANGERS WHO HAD PRESSED IN FROM OUTSIDE
BUT NOW TO RETURN TO BUSINESS MY GOOD SAMPSON
THEY MET AGAIN AT THE BALL WHERE LAURA WALTZED WITH PHILIP
AND I WANT TO SEE SMILING AND PLEASANTER FACES HERE
OH YES SIR
THE ONLY THING UPON WHICH THE DETECTIVE'S GLANCE LINGERED WAS THE LAMP WHICH MARGARET HAD EXTINGUISHED
THERE WAS NO IMPATIENCE NO VIOLENCE IN HER MANNER
THIS SPOT WAS MOST LOVELY BECAUSE OF ITS SOLITUDE
HUMAN NATURE IS A VERY NOBLE THING MUSED THE DETECTIVE
BUT I'VE ALWAYS REMARKED THAT THE TIGHTER YOU TIE HUMAN NATURE DOWN THE BRIGHTER IT COMES OUT IT WAS MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING WHEN THE TRAIN THAT CARRIED MR CARTER STEAMED SLOWLY INTO THE GREAT STATION AT HULL--IT WAS MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING AND THE BIRDS SINGING AND IN THE FIELDS ABOUT THE SMOKY TOWN THERE WERE HERDS OF SWEET-BREATHING CATTLE SNIFFING THE FRESH SPRING AIR AND LABOURERS PLODDING TO THEIR WORK AND LOADED WAINS OF ODOROUS HAY AND DEWY GARDEN-STUFF WERE LUMBERING ALONG THE QUIET COUNTRY ROADS AND THE NEW-BORN DAY HAD ALTOGETHER THE INNOCENT LOOK APPROPRIATE TO ITS TENDER YOUTH,--WHEN THE DETECTIVE STEPPED OUT ON THE PLATFORM CALM SELF-CONTAINED AND RESOLUTE AS BRISK AND BUSINESS-LIKE IN HIS MANNER AS ANY TRAVELLER IN THAT TRAIN AND WITH NO DISTINCTIVE STAMP UPON HIM HOWEVER SLIGHT THAT MARKED HIM AS THE HUNTER OF A MURDERER
NO PRYING EYE WOULD EVER READ IN MARGARET'S BRIGHT FACE THE SAD STORY OF HER EARLY LIFE
SOME GENTLEMEN DO SWEAR AND ROW LIKE IN TELLING ANECDOTES
TIE THEM UP TIGHTLY
I LEFT HIM HALF-WAY BETWEEN HERE AND ST CROSS IS THAT OTHER GENTLEMAN YOUR SERVANT SIR ASKED THE VERGER WITH UNMITIGATED SURPRISE
BUT I HOPE YOU WON'T WAIT DINNER ANY LONGER SIR NO NO
NOTHIN LIKE IT
THE YOUNG MAN'S HOPEFUL SMILE
IS IT REALLY MY WRETCHED BROTHER
AT LAST HOWEVER AFTER A JOURNEY THAT SEEMED INTERMINABLE BY REASON OF THOSE SHORT NAPS WHICH ALWAYS CONFUSE THE SLEEPER A ESTIMATE OF TIME THE DETECTIVE FOUND HIMSELF AT DERBY STILL IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT
GO ALONG ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MISS
SINCE FATHERS DO NOT USUALLY IMPLORE COMPASSION FOR THE ENEMIES OF THEIR CHILDREN
FEEBLE OLD PENSIONERS FROM ST CROSS CAME HERE SOMETIMES BUT NOT OFTEN
I SHALL ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE YOU WITH MY POOR MOTHERLESS GIRL HE SAID
SECRESY WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE FULFILMENT OF HER PURPOSE
MR BALDERBY AND ARTHUR LOVELL ARRIVED AT THE GEORGE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE TWO O'CLOCK
I'VE BEEN SOLD SIR--SOLD BY A YOUNG WOMAN TOO WHICH MAKES IT THREE TIMES AS MORTIFYING AND A KIND OF INSULT TO THE MALE SEX IN GENERAL MY HEART GAVE A GREAT THROB
FOR HE LOVED LAURA DUNBAR AND HE FEARED THAT HIS LOVE WAS HOPELESS
I'M SURE SIR I'M VERY SORRY SUCH AN AWFUL THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO THE--THE PERSON WHO ATTENDED YOU HERE MR DUNBAR HAD NEED OF SYMPATHY
NOBODY EVER SAW MUCH MORE OF THE MAJOR THAN HIS NOSE AND HIS MOUSTACHE
IS IT LOVE OR FEAR
IS IT LOVE OR FEAR
HE SPREAD THE CHAMOIS LEATHER OUT UPON THE TABLE AND CUT THE SKINS INTO TWO LONG STRIPS ABOUT A FOOT BROAD
WAS IT POSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THAT HOUSE WHEN HE BELIEVED THE PRINCIPAL MEMBER OF IT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS OF MEN
THE DAMP FOG THE SLOW DRIZZLING RAIN SHUT OUT THE FAIR LANDSCAPE UPON WHICH THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER HAD BEEN WONT TO LOOK FROM THE PLEASANT CUSHIONED SEAT IN THE DEEP BAY-WINDOW OF HER DRESSING-ROOM
HE EXPLAINED WHO JOSEPH WILMOT WAS AND IN WHAT RELATION HE STOOD TOWARDS HIM
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GO AWAY--TO PUT IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE WOMAN HE HAD LOVED SO DEARLY
AH PHILIP SINCE WE HAVE KNOWN AND LOVED EACH OTHER IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I HAD NO THOUGHT OR CARE FOR ANY ONE IN ALL THIS WIDE WORLD EXCEPT YOURSELF
AND SHE WENT HOME VERY DESPONDENTLY HAUNTED BY THE IMAGE OF HER DEAD FATHER
IT WAS THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR
A GENTLEMAN WITH A MILLION OF MONEY DOESN'T PUT HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF THE HANGMAN UNLESS HE'S VERY HARD PUSHED SAID THE DETECTIVE
BUT BEFORE THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES WAS COMMENCED THE JURYMEN WERE CONDUCTED INTO THAT DISMAL CHAMBER WHERE THE DEAD MAN LAY UPON ONE OF THE LONG TAP-ROOM TABLES
BUT SHE THANKED HIM FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS OFFER AND TOLD HIM NO THERE WAS NOTHING IN WHICH HE COULD HELP HER BUT I AM SURE THERE IS SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
DO YOU REMEMBER ENTREATING THIS BOY--WHO HAD A KNACK OF COUNTERFEITING OTHER PEOPLE'S SIGNATURES BUT WHO HAD NEVER USED HIS TALENT FOR ANY GUILTY PURPOSE UNTIL THAT HOUR SO HELP ME HEAVEN!--TO AID YOU IN A SCHEME BY WHICH YOUR CREDITORS WERE TO BE KEPT QUIET TILL YOU COULD GET THE MONEY TO PAY THEM
THE WITNESSES WHO HAD GIVEN EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST WERE AGAIN SUMMONED AND--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VERGER AND MR DUNBAR WHO WAS NOW A PRISONER--GAVE THE SAME EVIDENCE OR EVIDENCE TO THE SAME EFFECT
BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO SET THE MATTER QUITE AT REST SO I HURRIED ACROSS THE WAY AND WENT CLOSE UP TO THE YOUNG LADY WHOSE FACE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN BY A THICK VEIL
I WILL WAIT UNTIL I DROP DOWN DEAD ARTHUR LOVELL WENT BACK TO HIS CLIENT AND TOLD HIM WHAT THE GIRL SAID
HE GAVE A LONG SIGH OF SATISFACTION AS HE DROPPED WITH A SUDDEN PLUMP UPON THE SPRING CUSHION OF AN EASY-CHAIR ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE
THIS NOBLE GIRL HAD HEROICALLY PUT AWAY FROM HER THE ONE CHANCE OF BRIGHT AND HAPPY LIFE RATHER THAN BRING UPON HER HUSBAND THE FOUL TAINT OF HER FATHER'S CRIME
THE WORLD WOULD NOT LET ME LIVE HONESTLY AND THE LOVE OF LIFE WAS TOO STRONG IN ME TO LET ME FACE DEATH
I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING BUT NOT HERE SHE ADDED LOOKING BACK AT THE COTTAGE WINDOWS IN WHICH LIGHTS WERE GLIMMERING
I TOSSED OVER THE CHAOTIC FRAGMENTS THE SOILED ENVELOPES THE CIRCULARS OF ENTERPRISING CLAPHAM TRADESMEN AND ALL THE OTHER RUBBISH THAT HAD ACCUMULATED WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS
NO FIGURES CUT OF COLOURED PASTEBOARD AND GLUED ON TO THE CANVAS
SHE HAD NEVER ENDURED THAT SICK FEELING OF DESPAIR WHICH CREEPS OVER THE MOST CALLOUS OF US WHEN WE DISCOVER THE AMOUNT OF HOPELESS MISERY THAT IS AND HAS BEEN AND IS TO BE FOR EVER AND EVER UPON THIS WEARY EARTH
IF YOUR DAUGHTER LOVED ME AS TRULY AS I LOVE HER I WOULD MARRY HER IN SPITE OF YOU--IN SPITE OF THE WORLD
THE YOUNG LAWYER FELT THAT THIS GIRL WOULD NOT BE EASILY PUT OFF BY ANY DENIAL OF MR DUNBAR
THE ANGLO-INDIAN MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE RIFLED THE POCKET-BOOK AND LEFT IT EMPTY UPON THE SCENE OF THE MURDER IN ORDER TO THROW THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE UPON A WRONG SCENT
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS MY FATHER SHE SAID
THERE ARE ALWAYS TRAMPS AND SUCH-LIKE ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
REMEMBER HOW HAPPY WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
HIS DETERMINED REFUSAL TO SEE THE MURDERED MAN'S DAUGHTER
THIS WAS HER FIRST EXPERIENCE OF A HOME A REAL HOME IN WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING BUT UNION AND CONTENT
THOUGH THE DASHING GEORGINA WAS MORE GRACEFUL THAN DIANA THE GENTLE LAVINIA MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN VENUS,--MR DUNBAR WENT AMONG THEM WITHOUT PLEASURE AND LEFT THEM WITHOUT REGRET
HIS MIND SEEMED FULL OF PLANS FOR HIS FUTURE LIFE
FOR A MOMENT HE GLARED FIERCELY AT THE ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE OF LAURA WHO KNELT BESIDE HIM
HE HASN'T LEFT THIS COUNTRY NOT TO MY BELIEF FOR I'VE BEEN RUNNING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT OUTPORTS LIKE MAD
IF MY FATHER HAD FAILED TO ESCAPE AND HAD BEEN HUNG HE WOULD HAVE DIED HARDENED AND IMPENITENT
SHE IS LYING ON HER BED AS MOTIONLESS AS IF SHE WERE A CORPSE AND WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE BLANK WALL OPPOSITE TO HER
AND IF YOU WOULD I THINK I CAN HIT UPON A PLAN BY WHICH YOU MIGHT MAKE YOURSELF UNCOMMONLY USEFUL I TOLD MY COMPANION THAT I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GIVE HIM ANY HELP I COULD AFFORD HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT THAT HELP MIGHT BE
AND ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS PENANCE ON THE SOFA I GOT UP LANGUID AND TIRED STILL BUT BENT ON SOME EMPLOYMENT BY WHICH I MIGHT ESCAPE FROM THE SAD MONOTONY OF MY OWN THOUGHTS
IT WAS LATE IN THE MONTH
I WAS--VERY FORTUNATE
I WAS HERE FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A BOY
THIS MAN WAS CLEMENT AUSTIN THE CASHIER
BUT HE DID NOT READ A LINE UPON THE PAGE BEFORE HIM
I TOLD HIM THEN THAT IT WAS A FATAL FACILITY A FATAL FACILITY AND NOW HE HAS PROVED THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS BY HELPING MY SON TO TURN FORGER AND THIEF
HIS DAUGHTER WATCHED HIM FROM THE OPEN WINDOW AS HE WALKED UP THE NARROW LANE AMONGST THE GROUPS OF CHILDREN GATHERED EVERY HERE AND THERE UPON THE DUSTY PATHWAY
IF I HADN'T STOPPED AT THE BANKING-HOUSE YOUR MOTHER MIGHT HAVE STARVED THE REPROBATE MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS
BUT IT'S SO MANY YEARS AGO--SO MANY YEARS--I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD KNOW HIM
BUT THERE IS NOTHING STRANGE IN THAT
AND THE NEXT DAY I WATCHED AGAIN--WAITING ABOUT THE STREET AND HIDING MYSELF UNDER PORCHES OR IN SHOPS WHEN THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF MY BEING SEEN
IF SAMPSON DIES THERE WILL BE AN INQUEST NO DOUBT
BUT I MAY BE DETAINED FOR SOME TIME CLEMENT
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THOSE GARMENTS MUST CONTAIN A SECRET OR THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN STRIPPED FROM THE CORPSE
HE HAD BEEN VIOLENT PERHAPS AND HAD THREATENED HENRY DUNBAR
WORTH ON AN AVERAGE FORTY OR FIFTY POUNDS APIECE WE'LL SAY I SHALL HAVE TO BE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT MATCHING THEM IN COLOUR SAID MR HARTGOLD AS THEY'RE FOR A NECKLACE THE BANKER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
HE WENT IN BY THE LOW IRON GATE FOR THERE WAS A BRIDLE-PATH BY THIS PART OF THE PARK--THAT VERY BRIDLE-PATH BY WHICH PHILIP JOCELYN HAD RIDDEN TO LISFORD SO OFTEN IN THE AUTUMN WEATHER
HE FOUND ARTHUR AT HOME AND VERY DELIGHTED TO SEE HIS OLD SCHOOLFELLOW
WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN HE THOUGHT
DO YOU THINK I WILL CONSENT TO LOSE YOU SO LIGHTLY
WELL MISS LAURA IT IS RATHER WET REPLIED MRS MADDEN IN A CONCILIATING TONE
THE OTHER RIDERS COME IN VERY SLOWLY AND ARE OPPRESSED BY THAT INDESCRIBABLE AIR OF SHEEPISHNESS WHICH IS PECULIAR TO GENTLEMAN JOCKEYS WHEN THEY DO NOT WIN
IF SHE IS POOR AND WANTS MONEY OF ME I AM READY AND WILLING TO ASSIST HER
HE SAT DOWN UPON A CHAIR CLOSE BY THE BED AND WATCHED HER FOR SOME MOMENTS IN SILENCE WHILE HIS MOTHER STOOD BY SCARCELY LESS ANXIOUS THAN HIMSELF
THERE ARE SOME FORGED BILLS THAT ARE AS GOOD AS GENUINE DOCUMENTS
TELL HER THAT I AM WILLING TO SETTLE AN ANNUITY UPON HER
THEY RESTED NOW UPON THE BRIDE NOW UPON THE BRIDEGROOM NOW UPON THE FACES OF THE RECTOR AND HIS CURATE
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE AT THE FERNS AND REJOIN ME IN THE CATHEDRAL HE WAS TO RETURN TO THE CATHEDRAL YES BUT WHY SHOULD HE NOT HAVE RETURNED TO THE GEORGE HOTEL
AFTER BREAKFAST HE SAT IN HIS LUXURIOUS SITTING-ROOM SOMETIMES READING SOMETIMES WRITING SOMETIMES SITTING FOR HOURS TOGETHER BROODING SILENTLY OVER THE LOW EMBERS IN THE ROOMY FIREPLACE
AND AS SUCH YOU ARE A FITTING WIFE FOR A KING
HE PRESSED MARGARET'S COLD HAND
HE IS A PRISONER AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY LAID UP BY THE EFFECT OF HIS ACCIDENT THE OTHER DAY BUT NOT TOO ILL TO SEE PEOPLE BALDERBY SAYS
I EXPECTED TO FIND HER HERE DID YOU LEAVE HER THEN NO NOT EXACTLY
LET ME GO WITH YOU FATHER MARGARET SAID IN AN ENTREATING VOICE LET ME GO WITH YOU
TAKE ME WITH YOU MR DETECTIVE
YOU'VE HIT IT
THEY ACT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
HENRY DUNBAR FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR LISTENED TO HIS RECEDING FOOTSTEPS IN THE CORRIDOR AND UPON THE STAIRCASE AND THEN TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK
MONEY IS A VERY POWERFUL AGENT AND CAN BUY ALMOST ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT SAY IT HAD BEEN MADE TO ORDER LIKE
HAVEN'T I REASON TO TRUST YOU
THE UTTERANCE OF THAT NAME MIGHT HAVE JARRED UPON THE FATHER'S FEELINGS AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
YOU WILL WRITE TO MISS DUNBAR TO-NIGHT WILL YOU NOT SIR THE YOUNG MAN SAID AT LAST
FOR THERE'S NOT MANY PEWS OR CHURCHES EITHER THAT I_'VE EVER SAT IN THE MAJOR TOOK HIS PLACE IN A CORNER OF THE CHURCH WHENCE THERE WAS A VERY GOOD VIEW OF THE ALTAR WHERE THE FEEBLE FLAMES OF THE WAX-CANDLES MADE LITTLE SPLASHES OF YELLOW LIGHT IN THE FOG
HE HAD SUFFERED SUCH UNUTTERABLE ANGUISH SUCH INDESCRIBABLE TORTURES DURING THE TIME IN WHICH HIS GUILT HAD BEEN UNSUSPECTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A KIND OF RELIEF TO KNOW THAT HIS SECRET WAS DISCOVERED AND THAT HE WAS FREE TO DROP THE MASK
AND I WAS SUCH A SILLY OLD CREATURE MY DEAR THE WIDOW SAID TO MARGARET AS THEY SAT IN THE BOW-WINDOW LOOKING OUT INTO THE QUIET STREET
NOW LISTEN TO ME WILMOT HE SAID
THE LOVE WHICH HE BORE FOR HIS DAUGHTER WAS PERHAPS THE LAST RAY OF FEELING THAT YET LINGERED IN THIS MAN'S PERVERTED NATURE
I AM MISTAKEN THEN SAID CLEMENT INTERROGATIVELY
THE MEDICAL MAN'S EVIDENCE WAS VERY BRIEF
HENRY DUNBAR SENT HIS LITTLE GIRL HIS ONLY CHILD TO ENGLAND
AND CORRESPONDED FOR NEARLY A YEAR WITH CLARA CARPENTER WITH THE SANCTION OF BOTH OUR HOUSES AND EVERYTHING EN REGLE ONLY TO BE JILTED IGNOMINIOUSLY FOR THE SAKE OF AN EVANGELICAL CURATE?--WAS I WHO HAD RAILED AT THE FOOLISH PASSION--(I HAVE ONE OF MISS CARPENTER'S LONG TRESSES IN THE DESK ON WHICH I AM WRITING SEALED IN A SHEET OF LETTER-PAPER WITH SWIFT'S SAVAGE INSCRIPTION ONLY A WOMAN'S HAIR ON THE COVER)--WAS I CAUGHT AT LAST BY A PAIR OF HAZEL EYES AND A RAFFAELLESQUE PROFILE
I THINK THE FIRE WILL BURN NOW MR GILWOOD
SO MISS LAMBERTON DREW ON HER GLOVES SETTLED HER BONNET BEFORE THE GLASS OVER THE MANTEL-PIECE AND TRIPPED AWAY
THERE WAS A STRUGGLING FIRE IN THE SHINING GRATE
THAT WAS A MISFORTUNE A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT SPARKLED IN HIS EYES AS HE SPOKE
I'M A DETECTIVE OFFICER HE SAID FROM SCOTLAND YARD AND I HAVE A WARRANT FOR THE APPREHENSION OF A MAN WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIDING IN HULL
AND HE WAS TOO WELL BRED TO INTRUDE UPON HER GRIEF BY ANY FURTHER QUESTION
THEY HAD NO TASTES IN COMMON
MARGARET'S JOURNEY
THE ACUTEST OFFICIAL IN SCOTLAND YARD COULD HAVE GATHERED NOTHING FROM THE LINES FROM C
BUT THE DETECTIVE WAS NOT A PLEASANT PERSON TO TALK TO AS HE HAD A KNACK OF CUTTING PEOPLE SHORT WITH A FRESH QUESTION AT THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF RAMBLING
HE HURRIED TO THE BOW-WINDOW WHERE MARGARET WILMOT WAS SITTING NEATLY DRESSED IN HER MORNING GARMENTS WITH HER SHAWL ON AND HER BONNET LYING ON A CHAIR NEAR HER
BUT THERE NEVER WAS SECH A YOUNG INNERCENT AS ME AND I SEES MY PARTY SITTIN WARMIN HIS POOR LAME LEG AND WITH A CARPET-BAG AND RAILWAY-RUG AND SECHLIKE ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM
TALL BROAD-SHOULDERED HOOK-NOSE BROWN EYES BROWN HAIR MIXED WITH GREY THE DETECTIVE PUT ON HIS HAT AFTER MAKING THIS LAST MEMORANDUM
ALL THE REST CAN GO ON I WILL SEE TO IT SIR THANK YOU
AT A QUARTER TO EIGHT IT REACHED LONDON
SHE HAD A FEVERISH RESTLESSNESS THAT FIDGETED ME OUT OF MY LIFE
AS MR CARTER GAVE ME NO TOKEN OF RECOGNITION I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE DID NOT WANT ME TO INTERRUPT HIS COMPANION'S TALK SO I WALKED SLOWLY ON BY THE SAME PATHWAY ALONG WHICH WE HAD GONE ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
HE WAS A VAGABOND AND AN OUTCAST AND SCENES OF HORROR WERE NOT NEW TO HIM
BUT AS YET HE WALKED SLOWLY AND DOUBTFULLY IN SPITE OF HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ABOUT ONCE MORE
THE DETECTIVE SWEPT THE COAT AND WAISTCOAT AND THE PEBBLES BACK INTO THE BASKET AND THEN ROLLED BOTH OF THE SHIRTS IN A TOWEL AND DID HIS BEST TO DRY THEM
HE WAS ABOUT FIFTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS HAIR WAS GREY BUT THIS GREY HAIR DID NOT IMPART A LOOK OF AGE TO HIS APPEARANCE
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN CLEMENT I CANNOT TELL YOU MOTHER WHAT
IF SHE CHOOSES TO THINK AND SPEAK ILL OF ME SHE IS FREE TO DO SO
OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL WAS SAID ABOUT THE EVENT OF THE NEXT MORNING
AND-WHISTLED TO HIMSELF FOR THE HOUR TOGETHER AS HE STOOD BEFORE THE EASEL PAINTING SCENES IN THE HUNTING-FIELD OR ARAB HORSEMEN WHOM HE HAD MET ON THE GREAT FLAT SANDY PLAINS BEYOND CAIRO OR BROWN-FACED BOYS OR BRIGHT ITALIAN PEASANT-GIRLS
THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION
I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO LAY-TO WHILE I COME ON BOARD SAID THE DETECTIVE WHILE THE BOAT BOBBED UP AND DOWN ON THE WATER CLOSE ALONGSIDE OF THE SCHOONER
THE POOR LIKE HAPPY PEOPLE IF THERE IS NOTHING INSOLENT IN THEIR HAPPINESS
THE BANK CAN AFFORD IT WELL ENOUGH
PEOPLE PAID RESPECT THEREFORE TO THE STRANGER AT THE ROSE AND CROWN AND TOUCHED THEIR HATS TO HIM AS HE WENT IN AND OUT AND WERE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HE CHOSE TO PUT TO THEM AS HE LOITERED ABOUT THE VILLAGE
IF I CAN
ALTHOUGH AS YET HE HAD SAID NOTHING OF HIS GROWING LOVE FOR MARGARET
AND I SHALL WATCH MY FRIEND IN SPITE OF A NATURAL EAGERNESS TO TRANSFORM THOSE OBLONG SLIPS OF PAPER--THE CHEQUES SIGNED WITH THE WELL-KNOWN NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR--INTO THE STILL MORE CONVENIENT AND FLIMSY PAPER CIRCULATING MEDIUM DISPENSED BY THE OLD LADY IN THREADNEEDLE STREET OR THE YELLOW COINAGE OF THE REALM MAJOR VERNON DID NOT SEEM IN ANY VERY GREAT HURRY TO LEAVE LISFORD
HE HAD NOT CHANGED HIS ATTITUDE
THE MAN WHO COULD LURE HIS OLD SERVANT INTO A LONELY WOOD AND THERE MURDER HIM--THE MAN WHO NEITHER EARLY NOR LATE HAD ONE TOUCH OF PITY FOR THE TOOL AND ACCOMPLICE OF HIS YOUTHFUL CRIME--NOT ONE LINGERING SPARK OF COMPASSION FOR THE HUMBLE FRIEND WHO SACRIFICED AN HONEST NAME IN ORDER TO SERVE HIS MASTER--WOULD HAVE LITTLE COMPUNCTION IN TORTURING A FRIENDLESS GIRL WHO DARED TO COME BEFORE HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF AN ACCUSER BUT YOU SAY THAT MISS WILMOT WAS RESOLUTE AND HIGH-SPIRITED
SO MR CARTER NATURALLY ELECTED TO SACRIFICE THE TEN MINUTES AND TRAVEL BY THE EXPRESS
MY HEALTH IS SHATTERED AND I HAVE A HORROR OF ALL TRAGIC SCENES
SHE DID NOT REFUSE TO TAKE IT
BEN BOLT IT IS A FINE THING TO SAIL AWAY TO FOREIGN SHORES AND PROSPER THERE
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN PUT ME INTO A QUIET PEW BACK YONDER IN THE SHADOW WHERE I CAN SEE ALL THAT'S GOING ON WITHOUT ANY OF YOUR FINE FOLKS SEEING ME EH AS THE MAJOR EMPHASIZED THIS QUESTION BY DROPPING HALF-A-CROWN INTO THE BEADLE'S HAND THAT OFFICIAL ANSWERED IT VERY PROMPTLY I'LL PUT YOU INTO THE COMFORTABLEST PEW YOU EVER SAT IN ANSWERED THE OFFICIAL
A SMALL ROUND TABLE WAS SET IN A PLEASANT ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR
HAD SHE DONE WRONG THEN TO BE HAPPY IN HIS SOCIETY IF SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM--IF SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM
HE WAS SO VERY SELF-POSSESSED SO VERY DELIBERATE THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN RECITING SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD LEARNED BY HEART
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE TASTED BURGUNDY
I WILL NOT OFFEND YOU AGAIN BELIEVE ME
ADDED BY CLEMENT AUSTIN SEVEN YEARS AFTERWARDS
HENRY DUNBAR WAS GUILTY
MR DUNBAR LAUGHED ALOUD AT THE LAWYER'S ENTHUSIASM
YOU LEAVE IT TO ME AND YOU WATCH IT WELL SIR
I SHALL GO TO WORK IMMEDIATELY
YOU'LL BRING YOUR TRAPS SAWNEY CONTINUED THE DETECTIVE WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF BUTTERED TOAST
SURELY SUCH AN UNSATISFACTORY DINNER HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN SERVED AT THE GEORGE HOTEL
THE MAN THOUGHT ALL THIS WHILE HE LISTENED WITH HIS CHEST HEAVING HIS BREATH COMING IN HOARSE GASPS WAITING FOR THE REPLY TO HIS QUESTION
YOUR FATHER IS NOT AN OLD MAN
AND THEN I SHALL SEEM UTTERLY DESPICABLE IN YOUR EYES AND IT WILL BE A VERY EASY THING FOR YOU TO BLOT MY IMAGE FROM YOUR HEART
NO OVERSHADOWING FEAR NO HORRIBLE UNSPOKEN DREAD NO HALF-GUESSED SECRETS ALWAYS GNAWING AT THE HEART
WHEN HE HAD LEFT ME I WENT OUT INTO THE HIGH STREET
AND WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S MIRACULOUS TAKES HIM THAT WAY CHAPTER XLIII
IT IS VERY HARD UPON PUG-NOSED MERIT AND RED-HAIRED VIRTUE THAT A GRECIAN PROFILE OR RAVEN TRESSES SHOULD BE SUCH AN EXCELLENT LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
SHE FLUNG HERSELF FOR THE SECOND TIME INTO THE BANKER'S ARMS
I OPENED THE LOW GATE BEFORE THE THIRD COTTAGE AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN,--A PRIMLY-KEPT LITTLE GARDEN WITH A GRASS-PLAT AND MINIATURE GRAVEL-WALKS AND WITH A GROTTO OF SHELLS AND MOSS AND CRAGGY BLOCKS OF STONE IN A CORNER
HER FEATURES ARE ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT AND HER EXPRESSION IS MORE AMIABLE THAN HIS INDEED
FIRE WHICH LIT UP THE COZY DRAWING-ROOM TO THE COLD GREY SKY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
FAREWELL MR AUSTIN CLEMENT CAUGHT THE RETREATING GIRL BY HER WRIST
YOU ARE SURPRISED SAID MR DUNBAR
THEN HE TOOK HIS CHANGE FROM THE TAILOR COUNTED IT AND DROPPED THE GOLD AND SILVER INTO HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET
THE LETTER TO LORD HERRISTON WAS WRITTEN THAT NIGHT
HENRY DUNBAR AMUSED HIMSELF FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES LOOKING OUT AT THE BUSY STREET--THE BRIGHTEST AIRIEST LIGHTEST PRETTIEST HIGH STREET IN ALL ENGLAND PERHAPS
HOW MANY OF THESE ARE IN CIRCULATION HOW MANY MR HENRY REPEATED IN A FALTERING VOICE
VERY CLASSICAL AND EXTREMELY UNINTERESTING
AND IF EVER YOU HAVE NEED OF MY SERVICES YOU SHALL FIND WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HOLDS HIS LIFE AT SMALL VALUE BESIDE YOUR HAPPINESS HE SAID NO MORE FOR THERE WAS THE SOUND OF CARRIAGE-WHEELS BELOW THE WINDOW AND THEN A LOUD DOUBLE-KNOCK AT THE HALL-DOOR
ONE OF THE LADS IN THE STABLE SHALL GET A HORSE READY AND RIDE OVER THERE DIRECTLY
MR CARTER CAME IN WHILE I WAS STILL PONDERING OVER MY MOTHER'S LETTER
WHAT MR DUNBAR HE ASKED
I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE TO ANY OF MY INDIAN ACQUAINTANCES--EVEN WHEN THE WORLD HAS TREATED THEM BADLY
YOU KNOW HOW I'VE STRIVEN AND WORKED AND STRUGGLED
HIS DEATH MAY HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTAL
HE HAD PLANNED HIS FLIGHT AND MEANT TO HAVE LEFT MAUDESLEY ABBEY FOR EVER IN THE FIRST HOUR THAT FOUND HIM CAPABLE OF TRAVELLING
IT WAS SOMETHING FABULOUS PEOPLE SAID
TOOK A CAB AT THE WATERLOO STATION AND DROVE STRAIGHT OFF TO THE HABITATION OF HIS HUMBLE ASSISTANT WHOM HE MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY ROUSED FROM HIS BED
SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM AND SHE LOVED HIM
MR DUNBAR I BELIEVE HE SAID REMOVING HIS HAT
THE GIRL OBEYED VERY QUIETLY
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT MR WILMOT SAID CARELESSLY
I CAN WAIT PATIENTLY BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE TO GO HOME AND LEAVE YOU MADGE THEY WERE STANDING BEFORE THE GREAT IRON GATES AS CLEMENT SAID THIS
BUT I HATE THESE POPULAR DEMONSTRATIONS
WHEN THE HANDS OF THE LITTLE CLOCK IN MARGARET'S SITTING-ROOM POINTED TO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THREE JAMES WENTWORTH ROSE FROM HIS LOUNGING ATTITUDE IN THE EASY-CHAIR AND TOOK HIS HAT FROM A SIDE-TABLE
BUT HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO ME AFTERWARDS AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD MET HIS BROTHER IN LONDON ON THE SIXTEENTH OF THIS MONTH AND HAD TRAVELLED WITH HIM PART OF THE WAY TO SOUTHAMPTON
BUT HIS WRAPPINGS NOW WERE OF A GORGEOUS NOT TO SAY GAUDY DESCRIPTION
I SUPPOSE I MUST BE SATISFIED CLEM SHE SAID
LET THE SPARE ROOM BE GOT READY FOR ME
YOU'VE GOT A GENTLEMAN ON BOARD--A GENTLEMAN WHOM I'VE GOT A WARRANT AGAINST
AT THE SHORNCLIFFE STATION HE FOUND EVERYTHING VERY QUIET
YOU CAN TELL MR DUNBAR SO IF YOU PLEASE YES MISS
AN IDEA WHICH PLACED MARGARET WILMOT'S CHARACTER EVEN IN A WORSE LIGHT THAN THAT IN WHICH SHE HAD REVEALED HERSELF IN HER OWN CONFESSION
HIS MANNERS WERE THOSE OF A GENTLEMAN
THE LIVID PALLOR HAD PASSED AWAY BUT THE STRONGLY-MARKED EYEBROWS MET IN A DARK FROWN
YES THE DISMAL WEATHER MADE EVERYTHING DISMAL IN UNISON WITH ITSELF
THE NEW BONNET YOU BOUGHT IN REGENT STREET ONLY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HIS VIEWS A FEMALE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING BAD THAT EVER HAPPENED UPON THIS EARTH
THE HAIR PARTED ABOVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BROW I EVER LOOKED UPON IS OF EXACTLY THE SAME COLOUR AS THE EYES AND HAS A NATURAL RIPPLE IN IT
HAS ANYBODY GOT A BASKET YES
SAWNEY TOM RECEIVED THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CHAMPING AND WORKING OF THE JAWS AND WITH RATHER A DOUBTFUL EXPRESSION IN HIS DULL RED EYES
REMOVING THE THINGS ONE BY ONE AND THROWING MOST OF THEM INTO A HEAP UPON THE FLOOR
AND LAURA RAN AWAY TO HER DRESSING-ROOM LIKE A SCHOOL-GIRL WHO HAS BEEN PLEADING FOR A HOLIDAY AND HAS WON HER CAUSE
THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY EAST INDIA BANKERS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FIRMS IN THE CITY OF LONDON--SO RICH THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE IN VAIN TO ENDEAVOUR TO DESCRIBE THE AMOUNT OF ITS WEALTH
HER COMPLAINT AWOKE THAT OLD SUSPICION WHICH HAD LATELY SLUMBERED IN HIS BREAST--THE HORRIBLE FEAR THAT MR DUNBAR WAS GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF HIS OLD SERVANT
THEY CARRIED IT INTO THE WAITING-ROOM AND LAID IT ON A SOFA
TYING UP THE PACKETS AFRESH READING LETTER AFTER LETTER AND MAKING PENCIL MEMORANDA IN HIS POCKET-BOOK AS HE DID SO
THE DOOR IN THE YARD WAS NOT LOCKED
EXCEPT THAT TENDER AND GENTLE BEING WHOSE IMAGE VAGUELY BEAUTIFUL WAS SO INTERMINGLED WITH THE DREAMS AND REALITIES OF HIS CHILDHOOD IN THAT DIM PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT FROM THE EVENTS OF THE DAY,--THAT PALE AND LOVELY CREATURE WHOM HE HAD BUT JUST LEARNED TO CALL MOTHER WHEN SHE FADED OUT OF HIS LIFE FOR EVER
THE NEWSPAPER DROPPED OUT OF HIS HAND
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO BE WAITED UPON AND TO LOOK UPON THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED HIM AS BEINGS OF AN INFERIOR CLASS
I COULD NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING OR THINK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE MYSTERY WHICH SEPARATES ME FROM THE WOMAN I LOVE
IT WAS FROM MY MOTHER
SINCE HER RETURN FROM WINCHESTER SINCE THE FAILURE OF HER SECOND ATTEMPT TO SEE HENRY DUNBAR HER LIFE HAD PURSUED ITS WONTED COURSE
SHALL I GO AND SPEAK TO THIS GIRL ASKED ARTHUR LOVELL
POOR CLEMENT COULD NOT GO INTO THE WORLD YET
WHY CLEM SHE SAID YOU LOOK AS PLEASED AS IF YOU'D FOUND SOME TREASURE AMONG YOUR PAPERS I HOPE I HAVE MOTHER
BUT HE DID NOT COME
AFTER THIS I COULD ONLY TRUST TO THE CHANCE OF MISS WENTWORTH'S PROFICIENCY
AND I DID NOT GROAN ALOUD AS I HANDED IT TO HIM
THE BUSINESS IN WHICH MARGARET HAS BEEN ENGAGED THIS EVENING WAS OF A MOST PAINFUL NATURE--SO PAINFUL THAT I AM SCARCELY SURPRISED BY THE EFFECT THAT IT HAS PRODUCED ON HER SENSITIVE MIND
CLEMENT AUSTIN LOOKED AT HER WITH A BLANK WONDERING STARE
THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT FOUR PORTRAITS AND NOT ONE OF THEM BORE THE FAINTEST LIKENESS TO THE FACE THAT LAURA WANTED TO SEE
THE MAN'S MANNER WAS AS MUCH ALTERED AS HIS PERSON
DO WHAT HE WOULD HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF FROM THE WEIGHT OF THIS DREADFUL DOUBT
EVERYTHING WAS ACTUALLY SLIPPERY WITH CLEANNESS FROM THE NEWLY-CALENDERED CHINTZ THAT COVERED THE SOFA AND THE CHAIR-CUSHIONS TO THE COPPER COAL-SCUTTLE THAT GLITTERED BY THE SIDE OF THE DAZZLING BRASS FENDER
AS THE MAN HOVERED ABOUT US AT DINNER I EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT THAT MR CARTER WOULD LEAD UP TO THE ONLY TOPIC WHICH HAD ANY INTEREST EITHER FOR HIMSELF OR ME
SIR ARDEN IS THE GENTLEMAN THAT HAS TAKEN SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS CASE ON THE WAY THROUGH THE BACK-STREETS OF THE QUIET CITY THE PORTER WOULD FAIN HAVE EXTRACTED FROM MARGARET ALL THAT SHE HAD TO TELL
BE IT AS IT MAY THE MYSTERY OF THE WINCHESTER MURDER SHALL BE SET AT REST IF PATIENCE OR INTELLIGENCE CAN SOLVE THE ENIGMA
THE ROOMS ALL OPENED ONE INTO THE OTHER
THE RHODODENDRONS THE FEATHERY FURZE THE GLISTENING ARBUTUS--EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURED BY THAT CRUEL RAIN
THE CASHIER COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY RESIGN HIS SITUATION BUT WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE HIS EMPLOYERS A MONTH'S NOTICE OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF HIS SERVICES
MR DUNBAR WAS A HANDSOME MAN--A VERY HANDSOME MAN--TALL AND ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING WITH A CERTAIN HAUGHTY PACE IN HIS MANNER THAT HARMONIZED WELL WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS
A FAINT EFFLUVIUM THAT AROSE FROM THE MASS OF DILAPIDATED RUBBISH--THE WEEDS WHICH THE GREAT OCEAN TIME CASTS UP UPON THE SHORE OF THE PRESENT--TESTIFIED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MICE
EVERYBODY WAS RESPECTFUL TO HIM NOW PAYING DEFERENCE TO HIS ALTERED GUISE AND HE WENT WHERE HE LIKED WITHOUT QUESTION OR HINDRANCE
THE VERGER VENTURED TO LAUGH TOO
SHE WORKS VERY HARD ALL DAY,--POOR DEAR DELICATE-LOOKING YOUNG THING
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT WHEN SHE REACHED THE LITTLE GARDEN-GATE BEFORE MAJOR VERNON'S ABODE
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY THE WORK OF A FEW MOMENTS
COULD IT BE SO
COULD IT BE SO
THE BRIGHT YOUNG ENGLISH BEAUTIES FOUND THIS OUT BY AND BY AND DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO OTHER SPECULATIONS IN THE MATRIMONIAL MARKET
LITTLE DOROTHEA MACMAHON WAS SENT TO ENGLAND WITH A NATIVE NURSE AND PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF HER MATERNAL RELATIVES
SHE WILL LET ME BRING HER TO A HAPPY HOME AS MY CHERISHED WIFE I THOUGHT THIS AND THEN IN THE NEXT MOMENT I FEARED THAT MARGARET MIGHT CLING PERSISTENTLY TO THE DREADFUL DUTY OF HER LIFE--THE DUTY OF SHIELDING AND PROTECTING A CRIMINAL
THERE WERE PORTRAITS OF ELDERLY LADIES WITH STATELY HEAD-GEAR AND SIMPERING YOUNG LADIES WITH INNOCENT SHORT-WAISTED BODICES AND FLOWERS HELD GRACEFULLY IN THEIR WHITE-MUSLIN DRAPERIES
HE IN COMMON WITH EVERY BUSINESS MAN IN LONDON WAS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH THE NAMES OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
HE HAD NOT BEEN ALWAYS A CHEAT AND REPROBATE THE GIRL THOUGHT AS SHE SAT PONDERING UPON HER FATHER'S FATE
THERE WAS NO PREPARATION IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THAT HE HAD LEFT UNMADE
THE FURNITURE WAS HANDSOME BUT OF A PONDEROUS STYLE
HIS FATHER HAD LIVED FOR THIRTY YEARS AND HAD EVENTUALLY DIED IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF DUNBAR AND DUNBAR
TO PAWNBROKERS AND OTHERS.--A LIBERAL REWARD WILL BE GIVEN TO ANY PERSON AFFORDING INFORMATION THAT MAY LEAD TO THE APPREHENSION OF A TALL MAN WALKING LAME WHO IS KNOWN TO HAVE A LARGE QUANTITY OF UNSET DIAMONDS IN HIS POSSESSION AND WHO MOST LIKELY HAS ATTEMPTED TO DISPOSE OF THE SAME BUT THIS ADVERTISEMENT REMAINED UNANSWERED
WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED THE TWO SIDES AND THE END THAT WAS CLOSED HE TOOK FOUR OR FIVE LITTLE CANVAS-BAGS FROM HIS POCKET
WHEN HE HAD MADE THESE PURCHASES HE HAILED THE FIRST EMPTY CAB THAT PASSED HIM AND WENT BACK TO HIS HOTEL
IF ANY BODY CAN HELP US ARTHUR LOVELL CAN
AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE I PUT IN MY QUESTIONS AND KEEP ON PUTTING EM TILL EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION UPON THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT IS PICKED AWAY AS CLEAN AS THE MEAT THAT'S TORN OFF A BONE BY A HUNGRY DOG
THE CORNET HESITATED FOR A LITTLE AND THEN TOLD HIS UNCLE THE NAME OF HIS ACCOMPLICE
I WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A RETURNED CONVICT AN OUTCAST AND YOUR LOVE OFFERED ME A SPLENDID CHANCE OF REDEMPTION FROM THE BLACK DEPTHS OF DISGRACE AND MISERY IN WHICH I LIVED
GOD BLESS YOU MY POOR MADGE CLEMENT WHISPERED AS MARGARET FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND LOOKED WISTFULLY AFTER HIM AS HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRCASE
BUT THE WITNESS DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING PECULIAR IN THE MAN'S MANNER
THE INQUEST
AND INDEED SO CLOSELY DID HE KEEP HIS COMPANION TO THE POINT THAT A CONVERSATION WITH HIM WAS A KIND OF INTELLECTUAL HORNPIPE BETWEEN A SET OF FIRE-IRONS
THANK YOU
OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THIS IN THEIR IGNORANCE OF THE STORY OF THE PAST
TELL IT TO ME--TELL IT SHE STAMPED HER FOOT IN THE VEHEMENCE OF HER PASSION
AND SHE PLAYED WITH BRILLIANCY AND WHAT IS MUCH RARER WITH EXPRESSION
HE IS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE BRIBED YOUR FATHER TO KEEP SILENCE IF HE HAD ANY REASON TO FEAR WHAT HE MIGHT SAY
THOSE FEW LINES IN SAMPSON WILMOT'S LETTER SUGGESTED A MOTIVE
PAPA!--PAPA SHE CRIED
GOOD AFTERNOON MAJOR VERNON THE BANKER SAID CARELESSLY AS A LIVERIED SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL
SHE ONLY SAID THAT SHE WANTED TO BEAR WITNESS AGAINST HENRY DUNBAR
SO NOW FOR IT
WHO WOULD HAVE CARED AS LITTLE IF THE HANDSOME YOUNG BARONET HAD ROLLED UPON THE SWARD CRUSHED TO DEATH UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS CHESTNUT MARE SO LONG AS THEY THEMSELVES WERE WINNERS BY THE EVENT
I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR ME HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE LOW SOFA WHICH LAURA HAD PUSHED TOWARDS HIM RESTING HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES AND HIDING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
BUT I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH ME--I WOULD INDEED
MARGARET HAD LEFT THE ABBEY AN HOUR AGO ACCORDING TO THE FOOTMAN'S STATEMENT
YOU'VE GOT YOUR TICKET
THIS WILL GIVE YOU LITTLE BETTER THAN A FORTNIGHT TO MAKE ALL YOUR ARRANGEMENTS THE YOUNG CORNET STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN SHOT
IF YOU DO NOT LOVE ME MARGARET YOU ARE FREE TO GO MARGARET BOWED HER HEAD AND MOVED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
AND IS PREPARED TO ENJOY ALL THAT WEALTH CAN GIVE HIM
MESSRS
MAJOR VERNON WAS POSITIVELY SPLENDID
IN SUCH A MATTER AS THIS LAURA'S DECISION SHOULD BE SUPREME
WHY HE CAN DO ANYTHING WITH SUCH A START HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
IF MARGARET WILMOT HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY HENRY DUNBAR IT IS UPON HER TERROR THAT HE HAS ACTED
A WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION HAD CHANGED THE EARTH TO FAIRY LAND AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT I FOUGHT AGAINST THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE IN THE AIR AROUND ME
IT'S COMFORTABLE HE EXCLAIMED
THE VALET STARED AT MR CARTER WITH SOMETHING OF THAT REVERENTIAL HORROR WITH WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE REGARDED A WIZARD OF THE MIDDLE AGES
TELL HER THAT I WILL BE HER TRUE FRIEND IF SHE WILL ACCEPT THAT FRIENDSHIP BUT THAT I WILL NOT SEE HER UNTIL SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK BETTER OF ME THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD VERY SIMPLE IN ALL THIS
HA!--HUMPH MUTTERED MR CARTER
THE ASTONISHED PARLOUR-MAID TOLD ME THAT THE PACKET HAD BEEN GIVEN HER BY A LADY A LADY WHO WAS DRESSED IN BLACK OR DARK THINGS THE GIRL SAID AND WHOSE FACE WAS QUITE HIDDEN BY A THICK VEIL AFTER LEAVING THE SMALL PACKET THIS LADY GOT INTO A CAB A FEW PACES FROM OUR GATE THE GIRL ADDED AND THE CAB HAD TORE OFF AS FAST AS IT COULD TEAR I WENT OUT INTO THE OPEN YARD AND LOOKED DESPAIRINGLY LONDON-WARDS
THE DEED WHICH TRANSFERRED TO HIM THE POSSESSION OF WOODBINE COTTAGE WAS SPEEDILY EXECUTED AND HE TOOK UP HIS ABODE THERE
HE WAS SLAPPING HIS LONG THIN ARMS ACROSS HIS NARROW CHEST AND PERFORMING A KIND OF AMATEUR DOUBLE-SHUFFLE WITH HIS LONG FLAT FEET WHEN MR CARTER APPROACHED HIM
SOMETIMES A SUDDEN TERROR SEIZED HIM
WELL SIR THEN ALL I CAN SAY IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTIVE RETURNED MR CARTER
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S LIFE WAS NOT AN EASY ONE AND HE HAD NO TIME TO TURN AMATEUR DETECTIVE EVEN IN THE SERVICE OF THE WOMAN HA LOVED
I HAD BEEN MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF IN KYLMINGTON
BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS
THE DUST FLOATED UP TO MY FACE AND ALMOST BLINDED ME
LAURA LEANED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW PALE AND BREATHLESS WITH A POWERFUL RACE-GLASS IN HER HAND
PATRICK HENNESSY WAS SENT OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE MURTOCK GAVE HIS EVIDENCE
A CITY MAN MAY BREAK HIS HEART FOR DISAPPOINTED LOVE BUT HE MUST DO IT OUT OF BUSINESS HOURS IF HE PRETENDS TO BE AN HONOURABLE MAN
MASSES OF SHATTERED WOODWORK AND IRON HEAPED IN DIREFUL CONFUSION UPON THE BLOOD-STAINED SNOW
THE YOUNG MAN HAD LEARNED TO WALTZ UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ALPS AND MISS DUNBAR PREFERRED HIM TO ANY OTHER OF HER PARTNERS
IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY OBNOXIOUS TO ME TO HEAR MY POOR MARGARET SPOKEN OF AS A YOUNG WOMAN BY MY BUSINESS-LIKE COMPANION
ARTHUR LOVELL AND MR BALDERBY WERE ADMITTED TO HIM WHENEVER HE CHOSE TO RECEIVE THEM
THE YOUNG LAWYER WAS BOUND TO SAY SOMETHING HOWEVER
YOU HAVE YET TO SUFFER LIFE'S GREAT FEVER SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT HIM BESEECHINGLY
I THINK YOU'LL BE CHARMED WITH HER CLEM'--(I'M AFRAID I BLUSHED AS MY MOTHER SAID THIS
YOU'LL THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU TURN RUSTY WITH US
BUT THE OBJECTS SEEN IN THAT ONE BRIEF GLANCE HAD STAMPED THEMSELVES UPON THE GIRL'S MEMORY
AND BLOT MY IMAGE FROM YOUR HEART FOR EVER WHEN I AM GONE I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO LET YOU GO CLEMENT AUSTIN ANSWERED RESOLUTELY
AND SO BY AND BYE ON THE STRENGTH OF A FEW FOUL HINTS FROM A SCOUNDREL HE IS READY TO BELIEVE THIS GENTLE PITIFUL GIRL THE BASEST AND MOST ABANDONED OF WOMEN
SIR PHILIP WAS AMONG THE FOUR FOREMOST RIDERS KEEPING THE CHESTNUT WELL IN HAND AND BIDING HIS TIME VERY QUIETLY
NO MR DUNBAR I THOUGHT AS MUCH
CAME OUT QUITE A SWELL AFTERWARDS AND WAS VERY FREE WITH HIS MONEY AT LISFORD
AND HE REJECTED THE WAITER'S FISH-SAUCES IN A MANNER THAT ALMOST WOUNDED THE FEELINGS OF THAT FUNCTIONARY
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MARRIED
HERE THE GENTLEMAN IN THE FUR COAT HAD ALIGHTED AT AN ALE-HOUSE WHERE HE DINED AND STOPPED READING THE PAPER AND DRINKING HOT BRANDY-AND-WATER TILL AFTER ONE O'CLOCK
AND WHEN I'VE WORKED IT OUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF IT
BUT I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AN EVIL COUNSELLOR TO THIS YOUNG MAN AND I GIVE YOU WARNING THAT YOU WILL GET NO CHARACTER FROM ME
TO-MORROW WILL BE THE SEVENTEENTH
I WILL WALK TO THE HOUSE MARGARET SAID
I'VE SUCH A PLEASANT LIFE BEFORE ME AND SUCH AGREEABLE RECOLLECTIONS TO LOOK BACK UPON
BUT WHEN AS SO OFTEN HAPPENED HE MET MISS DUNBAR AND HER COMPANION STROLLING AMONGST THE OLD ELMS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GET OFF HIS HORSE AND TO WALK BY LAURA'S SIDE LEADING THE ANIMAL BY THE BRIDLE
SPEAK MARGARET AND SPEAK FEARLESSLY BUT MARGARET WAS STILL SILENT ONLY IN THE SILENCE CLEMENT AUSTIN HEARD A LOW SOBBING SOUND
BUT TWO MINUTES AFTER HE HAD COME INTO THE HALL AND WHILE HE WAS ORDERING DINNER HE TOOK AND BOTTONED HIS COAT
I CAN'T HAVE MY YOUNG LADY KETCH COLD SIR PHILIP FOR ALL THE PERSPECTIVES IN THE WORLD SAID THE FAITHFUL ELIZABETH
SHOULD SHE FAIL TO DO SO A STATEMENT OF HER CONDUCT WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE POLICE AND PROMPT MEASURES TAKEN TO SECURE MR DUNBAR'S FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION
GREAT DRESDEN VASES OF EXOTICS STOOD ON PEDESTALS OF MALACHITE AND GOLD
IT WAS LATE WHEN HE REACHED SOUTHAMPTON
HE WILL REFUSE TO SEE HER TO-DAY AS HE REFUSED BEFORE MARGARET FOUND THE FOOTMAN LOLLING AGAINST THE CLUSTERED PILLARS OF THE GOTHIC PORCH STARING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE LOW EVENING LIGHT YELLOW AND RED BEHIND THE BROWN TRUNKS OF THE ELMS AND PICKING HIS TEETH WITH A GOLD TOOTHPICK
BUT HE IS THE FATHER OF THE WOMAN I LOVE
HE NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF HIS BROTHER
BUT I HAD NO HEART TO GO BACK TO THE OLD BUSINESS NOW THE HOPE THAT HAD MADE MY COMMONPLACE CITY LIFE SO BRIGHT SEEMED FOR EVER BROKEN
YOU MISTAKE MY NATURE MARGARET AND YOU COMMIT A CRUEL TREASON AGAINST MY LOVE
MARGARET TOOK UP HER CANDLE AND WENT INTO A NEATLY-KEPT LITTLE ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE,--THE ROOM IN WHICH HER FATHER HAD ALWAYS SLEPT WHEN HE STAYED IN THAT HOUSE
IF HE WANTED TO DOUBLE ON ME AND GET BACK TO LONDON HE'D HAVE GONE BY ONE OF THE TRAINS WE'VE WATCHED
I NEVER HEARD ANY GOOD OF THIS MAN WILMOT AND INDEED I BELIEVE HE WENT TO THE BAD ALTOGETHER AFTER YOU LEFT ENGLAND MR DUNBAR INDEED YES ANSWERED THE JUNIOR PARTNER LOOKING RATHER NERVOUSLY AT HIS CHIEF
THE SCRIPTURES TELL US THAT
I AM TO PUT OFF THE DINNER THEN SIR ASKED THE WAITER
BUT HER FACE WAS QUITE AS COLOURLESS AS IT HAD BEEN UPON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND HER LIPS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS SHE SPOKE TO CLEMENT
THE CARRIAGE WAS ANNOUNCED AT LAST
LITTLE CHILDREN PLAYING WITH FLOWERS AND BUTTERFLIES IN THE GARDENS AT MAUDESLEY
YOUR NAME IS MY NAME IS MARGARET WILMOT THE WAITER STARTED AS IF HE HAD BEEN SHOT
MARGARET WAS IN NOWISE ABASHED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE
SO THOUGH I'VE EVERY REASON TO THINK WE SHALL TAKE MY FRIEND AT MAUDESLEY AS QUIETLY AS EVER A CHILD IN ARMS WAS TOOK OUT OF ITS CRADLE STILL WE MAY AS WELL BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST MR TIBBLES WHO WAS OF A TACITURN DISPOSITION AND WHO HAD BEEN BUSILY CHEWING NOTHING WHILE LISTENING TO HIS SUPERIOR MERELY GAVE A JERK OF ACQUIESCENCE IN ANSWER TO THE DETECTIVE'S SPEECH
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE LAURA THANKED THE FRENCH ARTIST AND THEN TOOK HER HUSBAND'S ARM AND WALKED AWAY WITH HIM
A GREAT MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN TO SEE THIS GRAVE AND HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING IT IN NO WAY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GRAVES
THE BRAND OF THE GAOL-BIRD WAS UPON HIM
I SUPPOSE THIS WEDDING AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY HAS PUT ALL SERIOUS BUSINESS OUT OF YOUR HEAD WHAT SERIOUS BUSINESS FATHER HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN LORD HERRISTON'S OFFER THE OFFER OF THE APPOINTMENT IN INDIA
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S JOURNAL CONTINUED XL
HE DID NOT PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE'S VISITS BUT HE SUBMITTED HIMSELF TO SUCH FESTIVITIES AS HIS DAUGHTER DECLARED TO BE NECESSARY AND DID THE HONOURS OF HIS HOUSE WITH A CERTAIN HAUGHTY GRANDEUR WHICH WAS A LITTLE STIFF AND FORMAL AS COMPARED TO THE EASY FRIENDLY GRACE OF HIS HIGH-BRED VISITORS
DO YOU REMEMBER ALL THIS
THAT ONE SMILE WAS ENOUGH
I THOUGHT OF MY POOR GIRL IN SOME LONELY MELANCHOLY PLACE HIDING WITH HER GUILTY FATHER
BUT HE EVINCED NO BAD TASTE IN THE SELECTION OF A COSTUME
HE WAS SUSPECTED
AND MONEY GENERALLY GOES A GOOD WAY IN THESE CASES
GENT IN FURRED COAT TURNED UP 2.10 TOOK A TICKET FOR DERBY 1 CLASS TOOK TICKET FOR SAME PLACE SELF 2 CLASS.--YRS TO COMMD T.T MR CARTER CRUMPLED UP THE NOTE AND DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY PORTRAITS GENTLEMANLY TO THE LAST DEGREE
JAMES WENTWORTH FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN AND THE PORTER
I TOLD YOU MY POOR FATHER'S MEMORY WAS GONE
SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS MR CARTER APPROACHED HER AND PASSED HER HAND ACROSS HER FOREHEAD
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON SEEN WITH THE DECEASED AND FOR THAT REASON IT IS SUPPOSED THAT I STRANGLED MY OLD SERVANT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS CLOTHES CRIED MR DUNBAR BITTERLY
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHINK MORE THAN THAT HE'S GOT A DEAL MORE MONEY THAN HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH SEEIN THAT HE PASSES THE BEST PART OF HIS DAYS SITTIN OVER THE FIRE IN HIS OWN ROOM OR RIDIN OUT AFTER DARK ON HORSEBACK IF REPORT SPEAKS CORRECT I TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO SAID THE MAJOR
CHAPTER XXXIII
NO SIR
NO SIR
NO SIR
HENRY DUNBAR WAS ABSENT-MINDED AND ATE VERY LITTLE
BUT BY-AND-BY WHEN THE CRIME IS HALF FORGOTTEN--WHEN SECURITY HAS MADE THE CRIMINAL CARELESS--WHEN THE CHANCES OF DETECTION ARE TEN-FOLD--THE POLICE HAVE GROWN TIRED AND THERE IS NO EYE TO WATCH THE GUILTY MAN'S MOVEMENTS
THE BELT HAD BROKEN
CHASING THE CROW MR CARTER WAS SO FAMILIAR WITH THE SPOT ALONGSIDE WHICH THE CROW LAY AT ANCHOR THAT HE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THAT PART OF THE QUAY AND LOOKED DOWN OVER THE SIDE FULLY EXPECTING TO SEE THE DIRTY CAPTAIN STILL LYING ON THE TARPAULIN SMOKING HIS DIRTY PIPE
ONLY I AM APT TO BE FOOLISHLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM
THE BROKEN PICTURE XVIII
BUT THAT MIGHT BE A BLIND OH OF COURSE IT MIGHT
OF COURSE I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE PAST
SHE WAS AROUSED FROM HER DESPONDENT REVERIE BY A DOUBLE KNOCK AT THE DOOR BELOW AND PRESENTLY THE NEAT LITTLE MAID-SERVANT USHERED MR AUSTIN INTO THE ROOM
YOU TALK JUST LIKE A POETRY-BOOK AND HOW CAN I ANSWER YOU UNLESS I WAS ANOTHER POETRY-BOOK
BUT THE GEORGE IS A WELL-BUILT HOUSE AND THAT WAITER LINGERED IN VAIN
YOU MUST LEAVE THIS HOUSE DIRECTLY SHE GASPED
HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT ON THE WAY TO SOUTHAMPTON HIS BROTHER SAMPSON WILMOT A MUCH OLDER MAN THAN THE DECEASED WAS TAKEN ILL AND THAT THE TWO MEN THEN PARTED COMPANY MR DUNBAR HAD SAID ALL THIS WITH PERFECT SELF-POSSESSION AND WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
I SAT ALONE BROODING OVER THE FIRE AND TRYING TO REASON UPON THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
I HAD PROMISED MR CARTER THAT I WOULD GIVE HIM ANOTHER HUNDRED POUNDS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT IF HE SUCCEEDED IN SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DEATH
AND HE DESERVED THEIR LOVE AND WAS WORTHY OF THEIR RESPECT
MR DUNBAR KNEW THAT THE SURGEON WOULD NOT CARE TO LET SO RICH A PATIENT OUT OF HIS HANDS
ONLY TO BE RECALLED NOW AND THEN IN A DREAM
AND INSTEAD OF THAT HE SENDS ME STRAIGHT TO MY DARLING WITH CARTE BLANCHE TO GO IN AND WIN IF I CAN
I WISH HER TO LOVE YOU BETTER EVERY DAY CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD HIS WISH
PEOPLE SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS AND HINTED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE ROTURIER IN MR DUNBAR
OH HE MURMURED VAGUELY THAT'S IT IS IT
THE RED LIGHT OF A FIRE WAS SHINING IN A WAINSCOTED CHAMBER HALF SITTING-ROOM HALF LIBRARY
I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU WHY SO BECAUSE THERE'S SOME ONE HERE WHO VERY MUCH WISHES TO SEE YOU
HIS HAT CAME LOW DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD WHICH WAS ITSELF LOW AND A PAIR OF BEETLE BROWS OF A DENSE PURPLE-BLACK WERE FAINTLY VISIBLE IN THE SHADOW OF THE BRIM
FOR SHE SAID BY-AND-BY HALF IMPATIENTLY HALF MOURNFULLY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME ELIZABETH
I'LL TRUST YOU
SHE HAD MET MR DUNBAR IN INDIA AFTER THE DEATH OF HER FIRST HUSBAND A YOUNG CAPTAIN IN A CAVALRY REGIMENT WHO HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE SIKHS A YEAR AFTER HIS MARRIAGE LEAVING HIS YOUNG WIDOW WITH AN INFANT DAUGHTER A HELPLESS BABY OF SIX WEEKS OLD
MR CARTER VISITED THREE PAWNBROKERS AND WASTED A GOOD DEAL OF TIME BEFORE HE MADE ANY DISCOVERY LIKELY TO BE OF USE TO HIM
I HAVE HEERD AS MR DUNBAR IS THE RICHEST MAN IN EUROPE EXCEPTIN THE HEMPERORE OF ROOSIA AND BARON ROTHSCHILD THE BEADLE SAID
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR GAME FROM THE FIRST AND I DON'T SEE IT NOW
BUT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE GOT SOME ROMANTIC CROTCHET IN YOUR HEAD OR YOU COULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF WRITING SUCH A LETTER AS THIS
BUT AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE HAD QUESTIONED ME A GOOD DEAL AND I TOLD HER THAT YOU HAD GONE TO WINCHESTER SHE STARTED SUDDENLY TO HER FEET AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
FOR I KNEW WHENCE THEY HAD COME
LIGHTS WERE SHINING IN MR DUNBAR'S WINDOWS BUT THE GREAT HALL-DOOR WAS CLOSELY SHUT
YOU MAY AS WELL SHOW ME THE CATHEDRAL HE SAID TO THE VERGER
WE WERE RECEIVED WITH VERY COURTEOUS WELCOME AT THE GEORGE AND WERE CONDUCTED TO A COMFORTABLE SITTING-ROOM UPON THE FIRST-FLOOR WITH WINDOWS LOOKING OUT UPON THE STREET
AND A TRAILING CURTAIN OF PURPLE VELVET HUNG HALF-WAY ACROSS THE ENTRANCE TO A LONG SUITE OF DRAWING-ROOMS--A GLISTENING VISTA OF LIGHT AND SPLENDOUR
IT WAS A HANDSOME APARTMENT LINED WITH BOOKS FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING
I HAD BEEN TO THIS SHOP AND FROM A GOOD-NATURED BUT PENSIVE MATRON I HAD HEARD TIDINGS THAT MADE MY BRIGHT HOPE A STILL BRIGHTER CERTAINTY
HE WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM AND WALKED UP AND DOWN
THERE WAS A PORTER'S CHAIR IN THE OUTER DIVISION OF THE HALL AND A BRONZED LAMP HUNG FROM THE DOMED CEILING
AT LAST ALL WAS DONE THE LETTERS AND BILLS ENDORSED AND TIED INTO NEAT PACKETS THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A LAWYER'S OFFICE
BUT WHEN SIR PHILIP AFTER MUCH HESITATION AND DELIBERATION PRESENTED HIMSELF ONE MORNING IN THE BANKER'S TAPESTRIED SITTING-ROOM AND UNBURDENED HIS HEART TO THAT GENTLEMAN--STOPPING EVERY NOW AND THEN TO STARE AT THE MAKER'S NAME IMPRINTED UPON THE LINING OF HIS HAT AS IF THAT NAME HAD BEEN A MAGICAL SYMBOL WHENCE HE DREW CERTAIN AUGURIES BY WHICH HE GOVERNED HIS SPEECH--MR DUNBAR WAS ESPECIALLY GRACIOUS
I SEE HIM ALWAYS WHEN I GO TO SLEEP SMILING AT ME AS HE SMILED WHEN WE WENT INTO THE GROVE
ON HIS WAY ALONG THE RIVER SHORE BETWEEN THE VILLAGE PUBLIC-HOUSE AND THE TOWN OF SOUTHAMPTON HE HAD FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH STONES
IT'S A REGULAR CALIFORNIA HE EXECUTED A GRIM CAPER IN HIS DELIGHT AND THE SCARED DEER FLED AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HIS PATH
HE TOOK THIS PICTURE OUT OF THE CASE DROPPED IT UPON THE POLISHED OAKEN FLOOR BEYOND THE MARGIN OF THE CARPET AND GROUND THE GLASS INTO ATOMS WITH THE HEAVY HEEL OF HIS BOOT
BY THE BYE YOU HAVEN'T A PICTURE OF HIM--A MINIATURE A PHOTOGRAPH OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT EH NO UNHAPPILY I HAVE NO PORTRAIT WHATEVER OF MY FATHER AH THAT IS UNLUCKY
I LOVED MARGARET TOO WELL TO FORGET ANYTHING SHE EVER SAID TO ME EVEN IN OUR HAPPIEST AND MOST CARELESS HOURS
YOU QUITE STARTLED ME ARE YOU GOING BY THE NEXT TRAIN
YET I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT YOUR HATRED AGAINST MY EMPLOYER'S SON IS ONLY NATURAL
HE IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT SOUTHAMPTON IN LESS THAN A WEEK'S TIME AND SOMEBODY MUST BE THERE TO MEET HIM AND RECEIVE HIM
SUPPOSE SHE'S ONLY A BEAUTIFUL COQUETTE WHO LIKES TO SEE MEN GO MAD FOR LOVE OF HER
BEFORE THE OLD MAN DIED HE TOLD ARTHUR LOVELL TO ACT IN EVERYTHING AS LAURA'S FRIEND AND LEGAL ADVISER
YOU ARE VERY GOOD
I'LL LEND YOU A NEWSPAPER MRS AUSTIN SAID GOOD-NATUREDLY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN THE PARTICULARS OF THIS MURDER I DO IF YOU PLEASE MRS AUSTIN TOOK A WEEKLY PAPER FROM AMONGST SOME OTHERS THAT WERE SCATTERED UPON A SIDE-TABLE
AND THERE STOOPS DOWN BEHIND AND WATCHES MY GENT HOBBLE INTO THE HOTEL IN AWFUL PAIN WITH THAT LAME LEG OF HIS JUDGIN THE FACES HE MAKES
THE NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY--A COLD WINTRY SUNDAY
HE FORGOT EVEN THOSE DARK DOUBTS WHICH HE HAD FELT AS TO THE SECRET OF THE WINCHESTER MURDER
I WILL CALL THERE EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING THE PROPRIETRESS OF JAKINS'S WHO WAS I DARE SAY SOMETHING OF A MATCHMAKER AFTER THE MANNER OF ALL GOOD-NATURED MATRONS SMILED SIGNIFICANTLY
IT WAS UPON THE 21ST OF AUGUST THAT ARTHUR LOVELL VISITED BASINGSTOKE
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE DODGE TO KEEP MATTERS SWEET FOR THE TIME BEING WELL GENTLEMEN THE POOR FOOLISH BOY WAS VERY FOND OF HIS MASTER AND HE CONSENTED TO DO THIS WICKED THING DO YOU BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE FIRST TIME YOUR BROTHER EVER COMMITTED FORGERY I DO MR BALDERBY
THE INQUEST XII
SHE ALONE CAN GIVE ME ANY HELP IN THIS BUSINESS HE HURRIED BACK TO THE SITTING-ROOM AND FOUND HIS MOTHER STILL WATCHING THE RAPID MOVEMENTS OF HER IVORY KNITTING-NEEDLES
WILL THE NEW ZEALANDER AND HIS COUNTRYMEN CARE TO KNOW THE MYSTERIES OF JUVENILE COIFFURES IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SHE IS A VERY GOOD LITTLE GIRL AND MY MOTHER ADORES HER
AND YET EVEN IN THIS THERE WAS SELFISHNESS
THERE WILL BE NO PEACE FOR US UNTIL THE SECRET OF THE DEED DONE IN THE GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WORKING NIGHT AND DAY IN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S BRAIN GAVE RISE TO A FIXED RESOLVE
SHE HELD OUT HER LITTLE RINGED HAND AND THE JEWELS ON THE WHITE FINGERS SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT
STILL I DOUBT WHETHER IN THE FABRIC OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AGAINST JOSEPH WILMOT LEGAL SOPHISTRY COULD NOT HAVE DISCOVERED SOME LOOPHOLE BY WHICH THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED THE FULL PENALTY OF HIS CRIME
THE UNBIDDEN GUEST WHO CAME TO LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING XXV
AND EVERY MORNING HE ASKED THE SURGEON THE SAME QUESTION WHEN SHALL I BE STRONG ENOUGH TO WALK ABOUT CHAPTER XXXI
AND BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK THE GENTLEMAN WENT AWAY BEFORE EIGHT AND IT WAS NOW PAST THREE
HE COULD ONLY SAY THAT WHEN HE WAS CALLED IN THE BODY WAS COLD AND THAT THE DECEASED MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD THREE HOURS--OR HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FIVE HOURS
THERE WAS NEVER TO BE ANY MORE SUNSHINE IN MY LIFE
HE WILL CARRY IT OFF WITH A HIGH HAND DEPEND UPON IT CHAPTER II
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY FOR IT ONLY WANTED FIVE MINUTES TO THE STARTING OF THE TRAIN AND THE PASSENGERS HAD HURRIED OFF TO TAKE THEIR SEATS
HAD HE BEEN MUCH ABROAD
I HAVE A GREAT MANY ACQUAINTANCES HE SAID
CHAPTER XV
AFTER THE WEDDING
BUT I'M NOT PARTICULAR TO A SHADE
BUT MY MOTHER SAID THAT AS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE HAD WE SHOULD DO WELL TO DELIBERATE BEFORE WE CAME TO ANY DECISION
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE DREADFUL MAN CALLED HILDEBRANDE JOCELYN WHO AT SOME REMOTE AND MEDIAEVAL PERIOD HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO THROW HIS LIEGE LADY OUT OF AN ORIEL WINDOW THAT OVERHUNG THE WATERFALL UPON THE STRENGTH OF AN UNFOUNDED SUSPICION
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS SELDOM WITHOUT THAT COMPANION
BUT PERHAPS MR BALDERBY DID NOT FEEL SO ENTIRELY DELIGHTED TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTERWARDS WHEN MR ISAAC HARTGOLD PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE COUNTER IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE WHENCE HE DEPARTED SOME TIME AFTERWARDS CARRYING AWAY WITH HIM SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS IN BANK-OF-ENGLAND NOTES
I WILL CALL FOR THEM ON THURSDAY MORNING
AND VERY MANGY WITH REGARD TO THE POODLE COLLAR
PEOPLE WENT IN AND OUT IN AND OUT ALL THROUGH THE LONG MORNING
THE MOST HEROIC NATURE GIVES WAY BEFORE ITS UTTER DESOLATION
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT HIM AND NOT PERCEIVE AS MUCH AS THAT
BUT THE SURGEON BORE WITNESS THAT THE DEAD MAN THOUGH TALL AND STALWART-LOOKING HAD NOT BEEN STRONG
AND WHEN I WENT IN HE WAS AS WHITE AS A SHEET POOR GENTLEMAN
BUT HE DESCRIBED THE RICH MAN'S MANNER AS HAVING BEEN AFFABLE IN THE EXTREME
BUT HE KNEW THAT THE MILLIONAIRE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN HAD HE DARED TO MAKE PROPOSALS FOR LAURA'S HAND
AT SIX THE LONDON EXPRESS LEFT RUGBY
THE CORONER REPEATED HIS QUESTION
TALL AND BROAD-CHESTED WITH GREY HAIR AND MOUSTACHE AND WITH A HAUGHTY SMILE UPON HIS HANDSOME FACE
REMEMBER THAT I AM WAITED FOR
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARGARET HAD ENTERED THE ROOM TERROR TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
YES I AM GENERALLY PUNCTUAL THE TWO MEN SHOOK HANDS AND MR BALDERBY WHEELED FORWARD A MOROCCO-COVERED ARM-CHAIR FOR HIS SENIOR PARTNER AND THEN TOOK HIS SEAT OPPOSITE TO HIM WITH ONLY THE SMALL OFFICE TABLE BETWEEN THEM
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED ONCE THIS MORNING MY DEAR AND YOU SEEM AS IF YOU'D SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND I'VE BEEN THINKING OF MY POOR FATHER MARGARET ANSWERED QUIETLY
THE WIDOW CAME OUT TO HIM PRESENTLY
I HAVE NO SPECIAL TROUBLE
I RETURNED BOTH THE ENCLOSURES
THE MEETING AT THE RAILWAY STATION IV
THE MYSTERY OF MY BETROTHED WIFE'S RENUNCIATION OF MY LOVE HAD BEEN SOLVED
HE WAS IN THAT UNSETTLED FRAME OF MIND WHICH IS COMMON TO THE LEAST NERVOUS PERSONS WHEN THEY ARE KEPT WAITING KEPT IN SUSPENSE BY SOME UNACCOUNTABLE EVENT
TO-DAY I MUST AND WILL HAVE REST
AND THEN WHEN SHE HAD GAINED HER PURPOSE AND STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH HIM SHE WOULD BOLDLY DENOUNCE HIM AS HER FATHER'S MURDERER
ARTHUR LOVELL HAD BEEN INDEFATIGABLE IN THE SERVICE OF HIS CLIENT
BUT HE KNEW THAT THE MONEY WAS SAFE
YOU ARE MISTAKEN
IF JOSEPH WILMOT WAS THE TREACHEROUS MURDERER OF HIS OLD MASTER HE MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE HE WAS CLEVER AS BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO EMINENTLY STUPID
IF IT HAS BEEN MY DESTINY TO BRING THIS GREAT SORROW UPON HER I THOUGHT IT SHALL BE MY DUTY TO MAKE HER FUTURE SAFE AND HAPPY BUT WOULD MARGARET EVER CONSENT TO BE MY WIFE IF SHE DISCOVERED THAT I HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF BRINGING ABOUT THE DISCOVERY OF HER FATHER'S CRIME
HE SAT WITH HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND
I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU FROM MR BALDERBY
I CAN'T QUITE EXACTLY SAY HOW LONG IT WAS SIR THE OLD MAN ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE
I HAVE LOVED YOU FROM THE FIRST DEAR--YES FROM THE VERY FIRST SUMMER TWILIGHT IN WHICH I SAW YOUR PALE PENSIVE FACE IN THE DUSKY LITTLE GARDEN AT WANDSWORTH
SO LONG AS THEY WERE NOT WASTED UPON AN UNWORTHY OBJECT
THE TOWN OF WANDSWORTH IS NOT A GAY PLACE
SHE RECOILED FROM HIM WITH A LOOK OF HORROR AND SHRANK AGAINST THE WALL AS IF HER CHIEF DESIRE WAS TO AVOID THE SLIGHTEST CONTACT WITH HER LOVER
NOT SLOWLY OR THOUGHTFULLY BUT WITH A BRISK EAGER TREAD THAT WAS NEW TO ME
HER FATHER'S MISERABLE FATE MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE BLOW TO HER DID YOU OFFER HER MONEY I DID AND SHE SHE REFUSED IT MR DUNBAR WINCED AS IF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GIRL'S REFUSAL HAD STUNG HIM TO THE QUICK
HE IS IN ENGLAND THEN NO
I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED YESTERDAY MORNING BY A VISIT FROM MARGARET WILMOT
A DASHING YOUNG FELLOW HE WAS TOO
THE ONE CLUE BY WHICH THE POLICE HOPED TO TRACE THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE ASSASSIN WAS THE BOOTY WHICH HIS CRIME HAD SECURED TO HIM
A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES--HAT BOOTS UMBRELLA A CARPET-BAG HALF-A-DOZEN SHIRTS BRUSH AND COMB SHAVING TACKLE AND ALL THE ET-CETERAS
FOR HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE PAINS TO CONCEAL HIS FEELINGS FROM THE INDULGENT MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN HIS CONFIDANTE EVER SINCE HIS FIRST BOYISH LOVES AT A CLAPHAM SEMINARY WITHIN WHOSE SACRED WALLS HE HAD BEEN ADMITTED ON TUESDAYS AND FRIDAYS TO LEARN DANCING IN THE DELIGHTFUL SOCIETY OF FIVE-AND-THIRTY YOUNG LADIES
I HENRY DUNBAR STOPPED SUDDENLY WITH HIS HAND UPON HIS SIDE
IF HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND THE TRIUMPHANT GRIN UPON HIS FACE CHANGED TO A THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSION
NOTES FROM A JOURNAL KEPT BY CLEMENT AUSTIN DURING HIS JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER
HE ASKED THE SURGEON WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHY IT WAS THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THAT STRANGE PLACE
THERE WAS NO TRAIN DUE FOR SOME TIME YET
BUT THEY HAVE NEVER SAID THEM TWICE IN MY HEARING HER EYES FLASHED THROUGH A VEIL OF TEARS AS SHE SPOKE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER EYES THAT HELD HIM AT BAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN ROOTED TO THE SPOT ON WHICH HE STOOD
AND IN THE NEXT MINUTE THE DETECTIVE WAS SCRAMBLING UP THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL BY THE AID OF A ROPE FLUNG OUT BY ONE OF THE SAILORS ON BOARD THE CROW
THE HOUSEMAID AT WOODBINE COTTAGE
I WILL NOT FORGET THAT NAME CHAPTER III
BUT HOW IS IT YOU'RE RUNNING ABOUT AFTER HIM AS IF HE WAS A LITTLE BOY THAT HAD BOLTED FROM HIS PRECIOUS MOTHER
I WILL ANSWER YOU FOR I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE AN HONEST MAN
YOU ARE A STRANGER TO ME I AM NO STRANGER AND I AM NO MESSENGER ANSWERED THE OTHER
I HAVE NEITHER THE POWER NOR THE WISH TO SHIELD HIM
HE ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS PRESENTLY ABOUT SIR PHILIP WHO HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GREATCOAT BY THIS TIME AND APPEARED IN ALL THE GLORY OF A SCARLET SATIN JACKET AND A BLACK VELVET CAP
A VERY AWFUL EVENT HAS HAPPENED
AND ONCE WHEN I WAS FARTHEST FROM THE RED GLARE OF THE TORCHES A STRANGE FANCY TOOK POSSESSION OF ME
AND WHEN ONCE HE'S LEARNT HOW TO USE THEM IT AIN'T EASY FOR HIM TO KEEP THEM SHUT
HOWEVER NOW THAT I AM MY OWN MASTER I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU
IT PLEASES ME TO SEE EM AGAIN--YES BY GAD SIR IT PLEASES ME TO SEE EM AGAIN MR FREDERICK KERSTALL OBEYED HIS FATHER AND THE PICTURES BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DAMP SPONGE
BUT I AM TO PAY MY DARLING LAURA AN EARLY VISIT AT JOCELYN'S ROCK SHE SAID WHEN ARTHUR MADE SOME INQUIRY ABOUT HER ARRANGEMENTS
THE FOOTMAN MADE NO RESPONSE TO HIS PARTING CIVILITY BUT STOOD WATCHING HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR WITH A BANG
NO THAT WAS VERY IMPROBABLE
UPON MY WORD HE SAID I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SO VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE MARK
YOU'LL BRING SOME OF YOUR TRAPS WITH YOU SAWNEY SAID MR CARTER.--"I'LL TAKE ANOTHER MA'AM IF YOU PLEASE
HASN'T HE HAD THE EMINENT ADVANTAGE OF A COLLEGIATE EDUCATION--I MAY SAY A PROLONGUED COURSE OF COLLEGIATE STUDY
IT'S NO USE TALKING MY LORD THERE AIN'T A DRESSMAKER LIVIN AS WOULD UNDERTAKE THE WEDDING-CLOTHES FOR BARONET'S LADY IN LITTLE BETTER THAN A MONTH BUT MRS MADDEN'S OBJECTIONS WERE SPEEDILY OVERRULED
THEY COULD NOT TALK FREELY OF THIS SUBJECT--FOR IT WAS TOO GHASTLY A THEME FOR DISCUSSION--AND TO TALK OF ANY OTHER SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ALTHOUGH MR DUNBAR SPOKE OF JOSEPH WILMOT AS HIS INFERIOR AND DEPENDANT THE LANDLORD OF THE GEORGE REMEMBERED THAT THE MISSING MAN HAD LOOKED QUITE AS MUCH A GENTLEMAN AS HIS COMPANION
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND THE TWO MEN REMAINED ALONE AT THE LONG PONDEROUS-LOOKING DINNER-TABLE ON WHICH THE SPARKLING DIAMOND-CUT DECANTERS AND SEVRES DESSERT-DISHES LOOKED LIKE TINY VASES OF LIGHT AND COLOUR ON A DREARY WASTE OF POLISHED MAHOGANY
MY MASTER HAS SPOKEN TO HER SIR
I WILL NEVER LEAVE WINCHESTER GAOL HE SAID UNTIL I LEAVE IT WITH MY CHARACTER CLEARED IN THE EYES OF EVERY LIVING CREATURE HE HAD BEEN TREATED WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT BY THE PRISON OFFICIALS AND HAD BEEN PROVIDED WITH COMFORTABLE APARTMENTS
BUT COLD STERN AND IMPASSIBLE
FOR THIS PURPOSE HE URGED ON THE POLICE UPON THE TRACK OF THE STRANGE MAN THE ROUGH-LOOKING HAWKER WHO HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE GROVE ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER
SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL-GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
HENRY DUNBAR TOLD YOU SOMETHING--PERHAPS SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR DEAD FATHER--SOME DISGRACEFUL SECRET WHICH YOU NEVER HEARD BEFORE
THEY WERE OLD-FASHIONED ROOMS WITH LOW CEILINGS AND QUEER CUPBOARDS NESTLING IN OUT-OF-THE-WAY HOLES AND CORNERS
THE BILL-BROKER WHO DISCOUNTED THE BILLS SPEEDILY DISCOVERED THEIR FRAUDULENT NATURE
SUCH MURDERS ARE DONE IN THE WORLD
NO THE MEN TOLD HIM
AT ANY RATE THE WORK KEPT MY FINGERS EMPLOYED THOUGH MY MIND STILL BROODED OVER THE OLD TROUBLE
THERE WAS AN EMPTY CHAIR OPPOSITE TO THAT IN WHICH THE BANKER SAT
THERE WERE OLD PICTURES AND JEWELLED DRINKING-CUPS THAT DEAD-AND-GONE JOCELYNS HAD COLLECTED IN THE SUNNY LAND OF THE MEDICIS
GOOD NIGHT MARGARET
HOW HAD IT BEEN MANAGED
AND THAT BUT FOR HIM YOUR LOT IN LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT
AH MARGARET YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN MY LOVE ALL ALONG
AND JOSEPH WILMOT THE BANK-MESSENGER THE CONFIDENTIAL VALET THE FORGER THE CONVICT THE TICKET-OF-LEAVE MAN THE PENNILESS REPROBATE BECAME MASTER OF A MILLION OF MONEY
BUT THEN WHY IN HEAVEN'S NAME HAD MARGARET SET OUT TO WALK HOME WHEN THE FLY WAS WAITING FOR HER AT THE GATES
AND UP TO THE TIME OF THAT INTERVIEW AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY MISS WILMOT HAD STUCK TO THE IDEA THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER HE SAID AT LAST
IT WAS A STRANGE MURDER A BLOODLESS MURDER
PHILIP WAS RICH AND HE DISTRIBUTED HIS WEALTH RIGHT ROYALLY
SHE SET THE LAMP DOWN UPON A TABLE IN THIS ROOM AND FOUND THE FUR-LINED COAT HER FATHER HAD SENT HER TO FETCH
THE GREAT OBJECT TO BE ACHIEVED WAS THE IMMEDIATE CLEARANCE OF THE LINE
THE PERIOD OF HIS HABSENCE IS HUNCERTAIN AND IF YOU WANTS TO KERMOONICATE WITH HIM YOU WAS TO PLEASE TO WAIT TILL HE COME BACK MAJOR VERNON PUSHED ASIDE THE SERVANT AND STRODE INTO THE HALL
ANOTHER ESTATE SCARCELY LESS SPLENDID IN YORKSHIRE
BE IT AS IT MIGHT MR DUNBAR'S REFLECTIONS THIS DAY WERE EVIDENTLY NOT OF A PLEASANT NATURE
SAWNEY'S GOT THE CHANCE HE THOUGHT AS HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
SOONER OR LATER,--SOONER OR LATER,--THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION COMES
IF HE HAD ONLY TO GO TO THE FERNS SIR HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BACK BY THIS TIME EASY I'LL SMOKE A CHEROOT WHILE I WAIT FOR HIM THE BANKER SAID PASSING OUT INTO THE QUADRANGLE
FOR I BEGIN TO FANCY YOU'RE ADDICTED TO PREVARICATION
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN IN AWKWARD PAUSES OF THE CONVERSATION THE PATTERING OF THE INCESSANT RAINDROPS SOUNDED UPON THE WINDOWS
I WENT BACK TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE A BROKEN AND A DISAPPOINTED MAN
STOP HIM I SUPPOSE THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION INSPIRED STEPHEN VALLANCE TO MAKE THAT FRANTIC RUSH THOUGH THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF ESCAPE OUT OF THE VESSEL EXCEPT INTO THE OPEN BOAT OR THE STILL MORE OPEN SEA
YOU WON'T TALK TO THE SERVANT WHO WAITS UPON YOU HAS YOUR FRIEND THE MANNERS OF A GENTLEMAN OR HAS HE NOT
AND OF COURSE SHE'LL SHARE MY INCOME WITH ME AND WILL HAVE AS MUCH CAUSE TO BLESS YOUR GENEROSITY AS I SHALL HAVE IT'S A BARGAIN THEN ASKED THE EAST INDIAN LANGUIDLY
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO TO-MORROW I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA I SHALL WASTE NO MORE TIME IN ASKING QUESTIONS
THE TWO FIRST CARRIAGES DROVE AWAY FROM THE CHURCHYARD-GATE AND THE MUD UPON THE HIGH-ROAD SPLASHED THE CLOSED WINDOWS OF THE VEHICLES AS THE WHEELS WENT ROUND
OR CAN YOU GIVE ME PLEASANT MEMORIES OR PEACEFUL THOUGHTS OR THE HOPE OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS
I AM NOT A POOR MAN LAURA
YOU'D BETTER DINE AT THE ABBEY THIS EVENING
I CAN UNDERSTAND AS THEY MIGHT BE FLASH UNS HE REMARKED SIGNIFICANTLY
OR WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT MY HENRY CARTER COULD HAVE GIVEN UP SO PROFITABLE A PRIZE AS JOSEPH WILMOT IN ORDER TO PURSUE UNKNOWN CRIMINALS UPON THE HIGH SEAS
YOU'VE NEVER SOUGHT TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF MY LIFE THE TEARS WELLED UP TO THE GIRL'S EYES AS HER FATHER SPOKE
HER FACE WAS AS WHITE AS A SHEET OF PAPER WHEN I MET HER AND SHE TREMBLED AND SHRANK AWAY FROM ME AS IF EVEN MY PRESENCE WAS HORRIBLE TO HER COULD YOU MANAGE TO REPEAT WHAT SHE SAID THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT TO ME TO RE-OPEN MY WOUNDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR CARTER THE DETECTIVE
BUT THE LAWYER FELT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO ACT AND TO ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS CLIENT WHATEVER VAGUELY-HIDEOUS DOUBTS MIGHT ARISE IN HIS OWN BREAST
IN WHICH CASE I FANCY WE MAY LOOK FOR AN ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE
YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED TOO MUCH OF HIM
IT WAS A HARD THING FOR THE YOUNG MAN TO THINK OF HER BY THAT NEW NAME
WHY WERE YOU SO SURPRISED TO FIND HE WAS A VALET MR CARTER ASKED OF THE WAITER
YOU ARE AWARE THAT IN THESE SORT OF TRANSACTIONS READY MONEY IS INDISPENSABLE HE SAID
FOR I HAVE LIVED HERE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS--EVER SINCE CLEMENT'S BIRTH IN FACT--AND I KNOW ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IF SHE WERE AN ORDINARY PERSON SHE WOULD CRY AND THE RELIEF OF TEARS WOULD HAVE A MOST ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT UPON HER MIND
IT MUST ALL HAVE BEEN DONE FOR THE SAKE OF A BIT OF MONEY I SUPPOSE
AND CARVE MY OWN WAY TO FORTUNE
BUT MOST OF ALL DANGEROUS WHEN HE WAS MOST QUIET
MARGARET WAS VERY GLAD WHEN THE LESSON WAS OVER
MR CARTER WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE OF THE FISHERMEN
THE JUNIOR PARTNER OFFERED ANY AMOUNT OF BAIL FOR HIS CHIEF
IT WAS SOMETHING TO THIS POOR GIRL TO HEAR THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE WORDS
HE SPOKE OF THE LUNCHEON AT SOUTHAMPTON THE JOURNEY FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO WINCHESTER THE AFTERNOON STROLL DOWN TO THE MEADOWS NEAR ST CROSS
HE GRIEVED PASSIONATELY FOR MY POOR MOTHER
IT'S THE ONLY WALK I'VE EVER SEEN HER TAKE SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH
TELL ME HIS NAME FATHER SHE WHISPERED
I INSERTED AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE TIMES NEWSPAPER ASSURING MARGARET OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE AND DEVOTION WHICH NO CIRCUMSTANCES COULD LESSEN AND IMPLORING HER TO WRITE TO ME
THE BOX CONTAINED A FORTUNE--A FORTUNE IN THE SHAPE OF UNSET DIAMONDS LYING AS CLOSE TOGETHER AS THEIR NATURE WOULD ADMIT--UNSET DIAMONDS WHICH GLITTERED AND FLASHED UPON US IN THE LAMPLIGHT
YOU MUST GO ABROAD ANYWHERE SO LONG AS YOU ARE SAFE OUT OF THE WAY
SHE WATCHED THE RIDERS AS THEY SWEPT ROUND THE CURVE IN THE COURSE
A POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION PERHAPS
IT WAS SCARCELY LIKELY THAT HE SHOULD TELL ME VERY LITTLE MORE WAS SAID UPON THE SUBJECT JUST THEN
I GAINED ADMISSION TO--MR DUNBAR'S ROOMS AND YOU SPOKE TO HIM YES DID YOUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM CONFIRM OR DISSIPATE YOUR SUSPICIONS
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE WATER DRAGGED YOU CAN MEET ME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE GROVE
I AM REALLY UNEASY ABOUT THIS FELLOW'S ABSENCE HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THEN WALKED BACK TO THE OPEN WINDOW
PEOPLE CALLED HIM THE MAJOR
I WILL TRUST YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
A FLIGHT OF ROOKS CAME SCUDDING THROUGH THE SKY PRESENTLY VERY MUCH EXCITED AND CAWING AND SCREECHING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN AN ORNITHOLOGICAL FIRE BRIGADE HURRYING TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES OF SOME DISTANT ROOKERY
I'VE FOUND YOU MY RICH RESPECTABLE BROTHER AND I'LL STICK TO YOU
WHY SHOULD I SEEK TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF THIS GENTLEMAN'S FEELINGS
IT WAS NOT A TIME FOR RETICENCE
THIS DIARY-KEEPING IS A VERY FOOLISH HABIT AFTER ALL
THERE WAS NOT EVEN THE DIVINITY OF HELL ABOUT HIM
YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT
BUT WITH MARGARET--MARGARET,--SWEET NAME
THE HOUSE WAS AN OLD ONE AND THE FIVE WINDOWS FRONTING THE STREET WERE LONG AND NARROW WITH DEEP OAKEN SEATS IN THE RECESSES BETWEEN THE HEAVY SHUTTERS
THEN YOU WON'T FIND ME SLOW TO BEFRIEND YOU SAID MR DUNBAR
THE MAJOR LIFTED HIS BRISTLY EYEBROWS WITH A CONTEMPTUOUS TWITCH
HE ATE AND DRANK LIKE A MAN OF IRON
ONCE THERE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO CONTRIVE AN INTERVIEW WITH MR DUNBAR
QUIET AND BUSINESS-LIKE AS THE DETECTIVE'S MANNER WAS EVEN TO-DAY I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS EXCITED
BUT IF MR THOMAS TIBBLES IS TRUE WE SHALL NAB HIM AND BRING HIM HOME AS QUIET AS EVER ANY LITTLE BOY WAS TOOK TO SCHOOL BY HIS MAR AND PAR
AN ACTOR
THE WINDING STREAMLET RIPPLED ALONG AMIDST WILD FLOWERS AND TREMBLING RUSHES
IT WAS NEW TO HER TO BE LOVED BY PEOPLE WHOSE MINDS WERE UNEMBITTERED BY THE BANEFUL MEMORIES OF WRONG AND CRIME
THEY FELT NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT BARGAINING AND HAGGLING AS TO A FEW PITIFUL SHILLINGS WITH A MUSIC MISTRESS WHO LOOKED SO VERY POOR AND SEEMED SO GLAD TO WORK FOR THEIR PALTRY PAY
SHE LIFTED THEM NOW AND LINKED HER FINGERS TOGETHER WITH A CONVULSIVE MOTION
I DON'T THINK DUNBAR'S LIKELY TO HAVE GOT INTO MY HOUSE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE HE SAID
AND OH PLEASE DON'T TELL MASTER AS I TOLD YOU SHE SAID
HE WAS AS PALE AS HIS MASTER BUT HE DIDN'T TREMBLE AND HE HAD ALTOGETHER A MORE DETERMINED LOOK THAN MR HENRY
I SHALL GIVE A LITTLE EVENING PARTY ON PURPOSE THAT MY FRIEND MAY HEAR YOU PLAY SO MRS AUSTIN GAVE HER EVENING PARTY AND MARGARET APPEARED IN A SIMPLE BLACK-SILK DRESS THAT HAD BEEN IN HER WARDROBE FOR A LONG TIME AND WHICH WOULD HAVE SEEMED VERY SHABBY IN THE GLARING LIGHT OF DAY
DANGER TO YOU
SHE MAY ARRIVE EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER
MY BROTHER AND I HAVEN'T MET FOR YEARS UNTIL WE MET TO-DAY THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN WAS REMOVED FROM THE RAILWAY STATION TO AN INN NEAR AT HAND--A HUMBLE COUNTRIFIED PLACE BUT CLEAN AND ORDERLY
BUT IT ISN'T MUCH YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME
WHAT MORE CAN I DO NOTHING CERTAINLY ANSWERED ARTHUR LOVELL WITH RATHER A HESITATING MANNER
IT SEEMS THAT MR HENRY HAD LOST FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DERBY
BUT I SHOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO RETURN HOME WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING MADE ANOTHER EFFORT TO FIND AN INSTRUCTRESS FOR MY NIECE
MY WORK BEING ESPECIALLY HARD AT THIS TIME KNOCKED ME UP
A LOOK A SMILE A MOVEMENT OF THE GRACEFUL HEAD IS A MORE ELOQUENT ANSWER THAN THE MOST ELABORATE OF MISS CARPENTER'S RHAPSODIES
MR DUNBAR'S A VERY RICH MAN HE SAID AT LAST
AN HOUR--OR MORE AN HOUR OR MORE YES SIR HE WAS ABSENT MORE THAN AN HOUR
I SHALL WRITE TO YOUR EMPLOYER IN DUE COURSE HE SAID COLDLY
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT MY GIRL HE SAID
I SHOULD BE SORRY THEREFORE IF SHE HEARD ANYTHING TO SHOCK HER PREJUDICES
OR SEND HIM SOME POLITE MESSAGE OF THAT KIND
IS THAT SO YES SIR I'M VERY NEARLY CERTAIN
HE LEFT IT NOW A GENTLEMAN
WITHIN ALL WAS SPLENDOUR
I CAN ONLY HOPE IT FROM GOD WHO IN HIS SUPREME WISDOM ALONE CAN FATHOM THE MYSTERIES OF A REPENTANT HEART
BUT I DARE SAY HE AND I WILL SQUARE ACCOUNTS SOME DAY I AM NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE MY NEPHEW MR HUGH SAID
ARTHUR LOVELL HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT IN HIS POWER TO DISSUADE THE BANKER FROM LEAVING WINCHESTER UPON THAT NIGHT AND THUS BREAKING THE PROMISE THAT HE HAD MADE TO MARGARET WILMOT
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW I SHOULD HAVE MET MARGARET WILMOT HAD CHANCE THROWN HER IN MY WAY TO-NIGHT
THIS WOMAN WAS MARGARET WILMOT--THE HAGGARD TREMBLING GIRL WHOSE ALTERED MANNER HAD SO TERRIFIED SIMPLE-HEARTED MRS AUSTIN
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM FOR BY THIS TIME THE TIDINGS OF THE MURDER HAD SPREAD FAR AND WIDE
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE WHOLE STATION WAS IN COMMOTION
I CAN WRITE TO HIM AT THE BANK
HENRY DUNBAR STUDIED IT
ANY PASSER-BY WILL POINT IT OUT MR CARTER ANSWERED
HE LIVED IN A HUMBLE LODGING IN A NARROW COURT NEAR THE BANK AND WENT TWICE EVERY SUNDAY TO THE CHURCH OF ST GUNDOLPH
SHOW US YOUR WARRANT HE SAID PRESENTLY IN A SULKY TONE
IT WAS THERE I PARTED FROM MY SERVANT--FROM THIS MAN WILMOT IT'S A PRETTY SPOT SIR BUT VERY LONELY AT NIGHT
LET THE ROOM UP-STAIRS BE PREPARED
YOU DO NOT LOVE ME DEAREST
THE VERY THING YOU ARE HIDING FROM ME MAY BE THE CLUE I MOST WANT TO GET HOLD OF I DON'T THINK THAT I SAID
EVERYBODY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT MISS DUNBAR AND HER WEALTHY FATHER WHO LIVED SO LONELY AND SECLUDED AT THE ABBEY AND WHOSE WAYS WERE ALTOGETHER SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM
MY POOR CHILD
IF HE WANTED TO LIE-BY AND HIDE HIMSELF IN THE TOWN HE WOULDN'T HAVE DISPOSED OF ANY OF HIS DIAMONDS YET AWHILE--AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND WHY SHOULD THE CROW HAVE SAILED BEFORE SHE'D GOT THE WHOLE OF HER CARGO ON BOARD
YOU'VE SEEN ME A CLERK IN A MERCHANT'S OFFICE
I KNEW NOW THAT THE FAMILIAR FIGURE I HAD SEEN IN THE MOONLIT STREET AND IN THE DUSKY GROVE WAS NO PHANTASM OF MY OVER-EXCITED BRAIN
LORD HERRISTON TOLD YOU THAT I MIGHT TAKE TWELVE MONTHS TO THINK ABOUT HIS OFFER HE DID ANSWERED JOHN LOVELL
THE VERGER IN DESCRIBING THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON SPOKE OF THAT ONE FACT WHICH HE HAD OMITTED TO REFER TO BEFORE THE CORONER
I WAS SO WORLDLY-MINDED THAT I WANTED CLEMENT TO MARRY A RICH WOMAN SO THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOME STUCK-UP DAUGHTER-IN-LAW WHO WOULD DESPISE HER HUSBAND'S MOTHER AND ESTRANGE MY BOY FROM ME AND MAKE MY OLD AGE MISERABLE
AND YOU READ THE LETTER
HE'S KNOWN TO HAVE A QUANTITY OF UNSET DIAMONDS IN HIS POSSESSION--THEY'RE NOT STOLEN MIND YOU SO YOU NEEDN'T BE FRIGHTENED ON THAT SCORE
HEAVEN KNOWS I WAS ALWAYS SORRY FOR YOU AND COULD MAKE EXCUSES FOR YOU EVEN WHEN YOU SANK LOWEST THAT'S STRANGE JOSEPH MUTTERED WITH A SNEER
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE GAIETY AT THE WEDDING-BREAKFAST THAN THERE HAD BEEN AT THE WEDDING
THE VOICES THAT ONCE SPOKE IN HIS PRAISE ARE LOUD IN HIS DISFAVOUR
LAURA DUNBAR SHIVERED AS SHE LOOKED AT IT
A COUPLE OF SIXPENCES AND A FEW HALFPENCE
COME AWAY PLUTO SHE SAID TO THE DOG
SHE WAS VERY YOUNG--A MERE CHILD WHO HAD NOT LONG EMERGED FROM A BOARDING-SCHOOL--AND SHE MARRIED MY POOR FATHER IN DEFIANCE OF THE ADVICE OF HER FRIENDS
DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO TELL HIM MY SECRET OR LET HIM SHARE MY GAINS
BUT WHILE I STAY HERE HERE IN THIS DISMAL ROOM WHERE THE DROPPING OF THE ASHES ON THE HEARTH THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK UPON THE CHIMNEY-PIECE ARE LIKE THAT TORTURE I HAVE READ OF SOMEWHERE--THE DROP OF WATER FALLING AT INTERVALS UPON THE VICTIM'S FOREHEAD UNTIL THE ANGUISH OF ITS MONOTONY DRIVES HIM RAVING MAD--WHILE I STAY HERE THERE IS NO HOPE OF FORGETFULNESS NO POSSIBILITY OF PEACE
YOU'LL FIND MY QUARTERS A GREAT DEAL PLEASANTER THAN THIS MUSTY OLD BANKING-HOUSE I CAN TELL YOU JOSEPH ACCEPTED THIS OFFER IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING MY POOR MOTHER AND I COULD SAY TO HIM
PRAY MR KERSTALL OBLIGE ME BY LETTING ME SEE THE PICTURES I SHOULD BE VERY CHURLISH WERE I TO REFUSE TO DO SO THE PAINTER ANSWERED GOOD-NATUREDLY
HE HAD SLEPT TILL LATE AND HAD ONLY JUST FINISHED BREAKFAST WHEN THE WAITER ENTERED WITH MARGARET'S MESSAGE
AND I WANT TO SEE HIM
HE LEANED HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE GLASS AND LOOKED OUT WATCHING THE TALL FIGURE OF THE MAJOR AS HE WALKED RAPIDLY ALONG THE BROAD CARRIAGE-DRIVE THAT SKIRTED THE LAWN
YOU SAW MR DUNBAR YESTERDAY THE GIRL SHUDDERED AND OVER HER COLOURLESS FACE THERE CAME A LIVID SHADE WHICH WAS MORE DEATHLIKE THAN THE MARBLE WHITENESS THAT HAD PRECEDED IT
IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU MISS THE RAILWAY OFFICIAL SAID POLITELY I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY I'M SURE I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MURDER THE GIRL ANSWERED IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE THE MURDER THAT WAS COMMITTED YES MISS TO BE SURE
HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE HAD BEEN MOST CULPABLE
BUT OH I DO WISH YOU WOULD TAKE ME TO THIS MR KERSTALL'S STUDIO AT ONCE
SO LONG AS MAN DEALS WITH HIS FELLOW-MAN SO LONG AS LAWS ENDURE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE HELPLESS AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED THE COURSE OF JUSTICE MUST KNOW NO HINDRANCE FROM ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATION
YES THERE IS A DOOR I BELIEVE IS IT LOCKED NO
AND THE LAUGHTER OF THE TWO MEN ECHOED HARSHLY THROUGH THE SOLEMN PLACE
BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE GOSPEL NOW
WE WON'T GIVE IT UP JUST YET LADY JOCELYN HE SAID CHEERFULLY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK EXCLAIMED THE BANKER
BUT I GOT A KIND OF FEVER IN MY BLOOD AND NIGHT AND DAY I ONLY THOUGHT OF ONE THING AND THAT WAS MY CHANCE OF ESCAPE
SHE THINKS I'M SOMETHING IN THE CITY BLESS HER DEAR LITTLE HEART THIS TOUCH OF SENTIMENT IN MR CARTER'S CONVERSATION WAS QUITE UNAFFECTED AND I FELT ALL THE MORE INCLINED TO TRUST HIM AFTER THIS LITTLE REVELATION OF HIS DOMESTIC LIFE
THERE WAS AN AWFUL CAUSE FOR THAT SUDDEN START THAT LOOK OF HORROR IN THE REPROBATE'S FACE
HORROR SURPRISE AND THE DREAD AGONY OF SUDDEN DEATH WERE ALL BLENDED IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE
BUT PHILIP JOCELYN WALKED UPON HER LEFT HAND AND THE CROWD HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO STARE AT BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
THE VALET PACKED HIS MASTER'S PORTMANTEAU AND DRESSING-CASE
ONE OF OUR PEOPLE WENT DOWN TO THE FORESTERS ARMS OUT OF CURIOSITY AS YOU MAY SAY AND HE RECOGNIZED THE MURDERED MAN DIRECTLY AS THE VERY GENTLEMAN THAT CAME INTO THIS HOUSE WITH YOU SIR AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO-DAY MR DUNBAR RETIRED TO THE APARTMENT THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM
I SHAN'T TAKE THE VEHICLE INTO THE PARK
BUT BE QUICK ABOUT IT
HE LOOKED UPON THE MAN WHOM HE HAD ONCE LOVED AND TRUSTED AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF HIS DISGRACE AND MISERY AND THIS THOUGHT INFLUENCED HIS OPINION OF ALL MANKIND
YOU DON'T WANT ME
I'VE SEEN RETRIBUTION COME VERY LATE VERY LATE
SHE WAS STILL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS MARGARET WENTWORTH
YOU'LL GO FASTER THAN I CAN
ONE OF THE FISHERMEN THREW OFF HIS SHOES AND TOOK A HEADER INTO THE WATER
THANK GOD YOU HAVE RETURNED
PRAY TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP YOURSELF CLEM I WILL MOTHER CLEMENT RETURNED TO HIS ROOM
THEY'LL COME ALL OF A HEAP OR ANYHOW
THERE WAS A TRAIN FOR DERBY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN LONDON HE SAID
BE MY WIFE DEAR ONE
TAKE CARE OF MADGE AND MAKE YOURSELVES AS COMFORTABLE AS YOU CAN
FOR IT IS ONLY THOSE BLESSINGS THAT WILL THIN THE CROWDED PRISON WARDS AND ROB THE GALLOWS OF ITS VICTIMS
I WAS AS STRONG AS HERCULES
I DID INDEED
YOU WILL HOLD YOURSELF READY AFTER WEDNESDAY WE'LL SAY TO CASH SOME VERY HEAVY CHEQUES ON MY ACCOUNT CERTAINLY MR DUNBAR THEN I THINK THAT IS REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY
THE BELL RANG AND THE SOUTHAMPTON TRAIN RUSHED ONWARD WITHOUT THE TWO TRAVELLERS
THE COLT OF A THOROUGH-BRED SIRE BUT OF A STRONGER AND LARGER BUILD THAN A PURELY THOROUGH-BRED ANIMAL
SHE UNFOLDED IT AND EXAMINED THE PAGES
HE TALKED OF THE TOWN THE LAST ASSIZES THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY THE WEATHER THE PROSPERITY OF THE TROUT-FISHING SEASON--EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE MURDER OF JOSEPH WILMOT
BAH
I CAN'T HELP THINKING OF ALL THE ACCIDENTS I'VE EVER HEARD OF OR READ OF
WILMOT OWNED TO ME THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN LEADING A SOBER LIFE OF LATE YEARS
AND MAY YOU NEVER HAVE TO WATCH AS I HAVE WATCHED THE ANGUISH OF A GUILTY SOUL
BUT HE LEFT THE CLOTHES IN A CARELESS HEAP UPON THE FLOOR JUST AS THEY HAD FALLEN WHEN HE FIRST THREW THEM OUT OF THE BOXES
THIS WAS THE INFORMATION WHICH THE TWO MEN OBTAINED FROM A VERGER WHOM THEY FOUND PROWLING ABOUT THE QUADRANGLE VERY LITTLE WAS SAID
NON PIU MESTA'--I HEAR MY NIECE STRUMMING THE NOTES I KNOW SO WELL IN THE PARLOUR BELOW MY ROOM AS I WRITE THESE LINES AND THE SOUND OF THE MELODY BRINGS BEFORE ME THE IMAGE OF A SWEET PALE FACE AND DOVE-LIKE BROWN EYES
THIS IMPULSIVE AND SENSITIVE GIRL HAD SEEN HER FATHER'S ASSASSIN
CHAPTER IX
THE SERVANT WHO WAITS UPON HIM OR THE RAILWAY GUARD WHO SHOWS HIM TO HIS SEAT IN THE FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE THE PORTER WHO CARRIES HIS LUGGAGE OR THE SAILOR WHO LOOKS AT HIM SCRUTINIZINGLY AS HE BREATHES THE FRESH SEA-AIR UPON THE DECK OF THAT SHIP WHICH IS TO CARRY HIM TO A SECURE HIDING-PLACE--ANY ONE OF THESE MAY BE A DISGUISED DETECTIVE AND AT ANY MOMENT THE BOLT MAY FALL
IT WAS QUITE DARK WHEN HE ENTERED THE HIGH STREET AND THE TAILOR'S SHOP WAS CLOSING
THE PALE BEAUTY OF HER PENSIVE FACE WON HER FRIENDS WHEREVER SHE WENT
THE CONVICTION OF THE BANKER'S GUILT HAD SO GROWN UPON ME SINCE THAT SCENE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE THAT I THOUGHT OF THE MAN NOW ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN FAIRLY TRIED AND DELIBERATELY FOUND GUILTY
OBLIGE ME WITH PEN AND INK MR HARTGOLD MURMURED SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH A PROCEEDING WAS ALTOGETHER UNNECESSARY
IT WAS A CHILL AND DISMAL HOUR OF THE MORNING AND MR CARTER FELT SLOPPY AND DIRTY AND UNSHAVEN AS HE STEPPED OUT OF THE BOAT AND STAGGERED UP THE SLIMY STAIRS
YOU KNOW YOUR UNHAPPY FATHER TO HAVE BEEN INJURED BY MR DUNBAR AND YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF SECRETS OF A DAMAGING NATURE TO THAT GENTLEMAN
I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT HALF-STIFLED BY A HYSTERICAL SOB WHICH SHE COULD NOT REPRESS
I DID ESCAPE,--NEVER YOU MIND HOW THAT'S A LONG STORY,--AND I GOT BACK TO ENGLAND A FREE MAN
THAT IS TO SAY WITHOUT HAVING SEEN IT AGAIN
HE IS GOING TO DERBY AND HE'S WAITING FOR THE DOWN-TRAIN TO TAKE HIM ON TO THE MAIN LINE
IF I HAVE BEEN WRONG MARGARET
BUT HENRY DUNBAR WAS IN NOWISE DISCOMPOSED BY THE AWFUL NATURE OF THE EVENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED
LOOKING FOR THE PORTRAIT XXXVII
BUT THE CLOSEST INSPECTION SHOWED HIM NOTHING BUT A GOOD-LOOKING MAN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY YEARS OF AGE WITH A DETERMINED-LOOKING MOUTH HALF SHADED BY A GREY MOUSTACHE
I HAVE OFTEN HEARD THE OLD MAN REGRET THAT HE POSSESSED NO LIKENESS OF HIS SON
FAREWELL XXXV
THEN SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THE WATCH HAD BEEN CLEMENT'S GIFT SHE TOOK THE SLENDER CHAIN FROM HER NECK AND HANDED THEM BOTH TO HIM
HIS SILENT AND RESERVED MANNER HAD A GLOOMY INFLUENCE UPON THE SERVANTS WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM
PRAY RETURN TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND STOP WITH US UNTIL YOU ARE MORE COMPOSED NO--NO--NO LET ME SEE YOU HOME THEN OH
THE NAME IS NOT SUCH A VERY UNCOMMON ONE CLEMENT WENT TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM AND KNOCKED SOFTLY AT THE DOOR
BUT HE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN--HE WAS NOT A GOOD MAN LET HIM HAVE BEEN WHAT HE MAY MARGARET HIS MURDERER SHALL NOT GO UNPUNISHED IF I CAN AID THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN
AND THAT WAS ALL
TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE
HERE AND THERE HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PIANO OR A GIRLISH VOICE STEALING SOFTLY OUT UPON THE COOL NIGHT AIR
BOY AND GIRL RAMBLING HAND-IN-HAND BESIDE THE WANDERING AVON
THERE'D HAVE BEEN SOME CREDIT IN TAKING HIM BACK WITH ME
THIS PERSON WAS CLEMENT AUSTIN THE CASHIER IN ST GUNDOLPH'S LANE
VERY COOL TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
BUT NOT OFTEN
OR IF YOU DO NOT IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO SYMPATHY BETWEEN US AND IN THAT CASE MY LOVE IS INDEED HOPELESS
HERE I AM IN MY ELEMENT MR DUNBAR HAD LED HIS SHABBY ACQUAINTANCE INTO THE LOW TAPESTRIED ROOM IN WHICH HE USUALLY SAT
AT NORFOLK ISLAND HE WORKED SO HARD AND BEHAVED SO WELL THAT HE GOT SET FREE BEFORE HE HAD SERVED HALF HIS TIME
HE TOOK OUT HIS CARD-CASE AS HE SPOKE AND HANDED ONE OF HIS CARDS TO MR ISAAC HARTGOLD
WELL OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOURSELF--SO GOOD AFTERNOON THE DOOR CLOSED UPON MAJOR VERNON ALIAS MR STEPHEN VALLANCE WHILE HE WAS STILL STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM IN UTTER INABILITY TO REALIZE HIS POSITION
YES MY DEAR MR DUNBAR THE RICH BANKER
MR CARTER DRANK HIS STRONG TEA AND THEN ASKED MY PERMISSION TO GO OUT AND SMOKE A COUPLE OF CIGARS IN THE HIGH STREET
JAMES WENTWORTH LINGERED BEHIND AND CONTRIVED TO LOOK AT THE PORTMANTEAU
ANY CHEQUES SIGNED BY THAT NAME HE SAID WILL BE DULY HONOURED IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE MR HARTGOLD BENT HIS HEAD REVERENTIALLY TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A MILLION OF MONEY
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE FORM OR MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD NOT IMAGINED THE SITUATION
WHY CLEMENT SHE CRIED HOW LATE YOU ARE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE LEARNED HERE THEREFORE
BUT WHEN INVITATIONS CAME FLOODING IN UPON MR DUNBAR HE DECLINED THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE GROUND OF HIS WEAK HEALTH
GONE HE MUTTERED
THERE WAS A FRENCH PAINTER IN MY DAY SIR CALLED DAVID AND THERE WAS AN ENGLISH PAINTER IN MY DAY CALLED LAWRENCE
YOU WILL BE A PRISONER HERE FOR A MONTH OR SO SIR I REGRET TO SAY
GET UP MY MAN
I'M AFRAID I SHALL SCARCELY DO JUSTICE TO YOUR COOK'S ACHIEVEMENTS FOR I TOOK A VERY SUBSTANTIAL LUNCHEON AT SOUTHAMPTON THE LANDLORD BROUGHT IN THE SILVER SOUP-TUREEN WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND UNCORKED A BOTTLE OF STILL HOCK WHICH MR DUNBAR HAD SELECTED FROM THE WINE-LIST
HER OWN WANTS HER OWN NECESSITIES HAD NO PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS
BUT AS MR DUNBAR WENT TOWARDS THE FAMILIAR PARLOUR AT THE BACK OF THE BANKING-HOUSE HE STOPPED FOR A MINUTE AND LOOKED AT THE CASHIER
I HAD EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE SO FOND OF ME
AN OLD MAN STRICKEN WITH SUDDEN ILLNESS AND ABANDONED TO STRANGERS
WHY THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL CLEM YES MOTHER AND IT'S NEAR MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR--OR AT LEAST MR DUNBAR'S COUNTRY HOUSE YES MOTHER ANSWERED CLEMENT
I ASKED YOU JUST NOW TO TRUST ME MOTHER SAID CLEMENT VERY GRAVELY
SHE GOES PAST MY WINDOW REGULAR EVERY NIGHT JUST ABOUT WHEN I'M SHUTTING UP AND FROM MY DOOR I CAN SEE HER OPEN THE GATE AND GO INTO THE CHURCHYARD
WELL I SAID INTERROGATIVELY AS HE GAVE ME BACK THE LETTER
MR CARTER CAME IN A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
I SUPPOSE THE BANK CAN AFFORD IT MR DUNBAR EXCLAIMED WITH A TONE OF SURPRISE
BUT I HAVE BEEN IN INDIA FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AND HAVE SEEN NOTHING BUT PAGAN TEMPLES AND VERY BEAUTIFUL THEM PAGAN PLACES BE SIR BAIN'T THEY THE OLD MAN ASKED AS HE UNLOCKED A LOW DOOR LEADING INTO ONE OF THE SIDE AISLES OF THE CATHEDRAL
THEN HE TRIED THE DOOR AND FINDING IT UNLOCKED OPENED IT A FEW INCHES WITH A CAUTIOUS HAND AND LISTENED TO HIS MOTHER'S REGULAR BREATHING
TELL THEM TO DRIVE HOME SIR PHILIP HE SAID
ARTHUR LOVELL LAID THE INSENSIBLE MAN FLAT UPON HIS BACK ON THE CARPET
FILL A GLASS FOR YOURSELF WAITER AND PUT THE DECANTER DOWN BY THE FENDER
THERE IS NO BRIGHTNESS IN THE EYES OF THE BEAUTY
HAVE I LOOKED AT YOU CLOSELY EXCLAIMED THE BANKER
MARGARET HE CRIED
MARGARET HE CRIED
MARGARET HE CRIED
IT'S THE DEE-YUTY OF THE POOR-R-R DEPENDANT TO WAIT UPON THE PER-LEASURE OF HIS PATRON EXCLAIMED MAJOR VERNON IN THE STUDIED TONES OF THE VILLAIN IN A MELODRAMA
YES HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY IT IS VERY LIKE HER--ONLY ONLY WHAT THE PICTURE IS NOT LOVELY ENOUGH INDEED
I WOULD SOONER CRAWL FROM DOOR TO DOOR BEGGING MY BREAD OF THE HARDEST STRANGERS IN THIS CRUEL WORLD--I WOULD SOONER DIE FROM THE LINGERING AGONIES OF STARVATION--THAN I WOULD ACCEPT HELP FROM HENRY DUNBAR
BUT I WANT A BOTTLE OF CLARET WITH MY DINNER A GOOD COAT UPON MY BACK AND A FIVE-POUND NOTE IN MY POCKET CONSTANTLY
HIS REVERENTIAL AWE OF SCOTLAND YARD HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESSENED DURING THAT LONG TIRESOME DAY
YOU SHALL SEE HENRY DUNBAR
THERE'S NO CRIME IN THAT IS THERE MADGE HIS DAUGHTER SMILED AS SHE TRIED TO ARRANGE THE SHABBY VELVET COLLAR OF HIS THREADBARE COAT
I AM A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS TAKEN ILL UPON THE ROAD
FROM THAT PERIOD OUR LIFE BECAME A WANDERING AND WRETCHED ONE
THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT BUT I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH
AND EVERY CREATURE IN LISFORD WAS BENT UPON DOING HER HONOUR
BUT I DO MOST SOLEMNLY DECLARE THAT I SPEAK THE TRUTH AND AM NOT DECEIVED
BUT YOU'RE NABBED AT LAST THE MAN SCRAMBLED UP OUT OF HIS BERTH AND STOOD IN A STOOPING ATTITUDE FOR THE CABIN WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR HIM STARING AT MR CARTER
SHE WAS A PAMPERED CHILD AND SHE EXPECTED TO HAVE LIFE MADE VERY SMOOTH FOR HER
THE DAY CAME AT LAST A PALE NOVEMBER DAY MILD BUT NOT SUNNY
MIGHT IT NOT BE THAT THE GIRL'S INNOCENT SOCIETY WAS OPPRESSIVE TO HER FATHER AND THAT HE WISHED THEREFORE TO SHUFFLE HER OFF UPON A NEW PROTECTOR
PERHAPS A BETTER MAN MIGHT HAVE PERSEVERED IN SPITE OF ALL TILL HE CONQUERED THE WORLD'S PREJUDICE
IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY SAMPSON WILMOT
AND A DEAL YOU COME BACK AND DINED TOGETHER COMFORTABLE
THE POOR GIRL DREW BACK INTO THE CARRIAGE BLUSHING AND FRIGHTENED
HE ONLY SAW HER FACE
BUT I THINK THAT IN THIS BUSINESS THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CULPABLY SUPINE
AND THE LIGHT OF THE NIGHT-LAMP SHINING UPON HIS FACE AS HE SLEPT SHOWED IT DISTORTED BY STRANGE SHADOWS THAT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER THE SHADOWS OF THE DRAPERIES ABOVE HIS HEAD
TO-NIGHT MY DEAR SIR CRIED MR DAPHNEY
HE HAD CONSENTED TO APPEAR UPON THE RACECOURSE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER'S MOST URGENT ENTREATIES
HIS DAUGHTER'S CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES HAVE BETRAYED HIM YES MR CARTER SPOKE THE TRUTH
I HAVE PROMISED TO LOVE HER FOR EVER THOUGH MY LOVE IS HOPELESS AND TO SERVE HER FAITHFULLY IF EVER SHE SHOULD NEED OF MY DEVOTION ARTHUR LOVELL THOUGHT AS HE SAT SILENT AT THE DINNER-TABLE WHILE HENRY DUNBAR AND HIS DAUGHTER TALKED TOGETHER GAILY
HENRY DUNBAR WENT BACK TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY BY THE EXPRESS ON THE MORNING AFTER THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD COMPLETED HIS PURCHASE OF THE DIAMONDS
THERE WAS A HORRIBLE SMASHING TEARING GRINDING NOISE THAT WAS LOUDER THAN THUNDER AND MORE HIDEOUS THAN THE CRASHING OF CANNON AGAINST THE WOODEN WALLS OF A BRAVE SHIP
THE INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION
I REASONED WITH MYSELF AND RIDICULED MY MADNESS AND YET YIELDED LIKE THE VERIEST CRAVEN TO THE SWEET INTOXICATION
BUT I'LL NOT ANNOY YOU AGAIN
AND IF WE LIKE THE LOOKS OF THE PLACE WHY WE SHALL COME AND SPEND THE SUMMER MONTHS AT THE GEORGE WHERE WE FIND THE ACCOMMODATION IN GENERAL AND SAY THE FRIED SOLES OR THE MOCK-TURTLE IN PARTICULAR BETTER THAN AT ANY HOTEL IN THE THREE KINGDOMS
BUT NEVER MIND WE MUST CONTRIVE TO GET ON WITHOUT IT LAURA RANG THE BELL
THAT OF ALL YOUR OLD COMPANIONS THERE IS ONLY ONE LEFT TO GREET YOU
BUT THE MAJOR WAS BY NO MEANS THE SHABBY STRANGER WHO HAD WATCHED THE MARRIAGE OF PHILIP JOCELYN AND LAURA DUNBAR IN LISFORD CHURCH
JOSEPH LED THE HORSE TO THIS GATE
NO NO NO
BY MEANS OF THE CLUE WHICH THESE THINGS MIGHT AFFORD THE DETECTIVE POLICE HOPED TO REACH THE GUILTY MAN
VERNON IS A GOOD NAME
YOU SHALL SPEAK TO ME
THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE IT CAME OUT THAT HE WANTED MY BROTHER WHO HAD A WONDERFUL KNACK OF IMITATING ANY BODY'S HANDWRITING TO FORGE THE ACCEPTANCE OF LORD VANLORME
THE BROTHERS WERE ALONE IN THE CARRIAGE
BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR SHE SAID BUT I'VE BEEN THAT UPSET I DON'T KNOW SCARCELY WHAT I'M A-DOING OF
HE HAD MEANT TO LEAVE ENGLAND AND WANDER FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL MANNER OF UNFREQUENTED DISTRICTS CHOOSING PLACES THAT WERE MOST DIFFICULT OF APPROACH AND LEAST AFFECTED BY ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED TO DO SO--I CAN DO NO MORE
AND I WAS A BIT LATE THINKIN OF MY TEA AND YOU BELIEVE THEREFORE THAT MR DUNBAR WAS ABSENT FOR AN HOUR YES SIR
THE AUTHOR OF THE OPIUM-EATER SUFFERED SO CRUELLY FROM SOME INTERNAL AGONY THAT HE GREW AT LAST TO FANCY THERE WAS INDEED SOME LIVING CREATURE INSIDE HIM FOR EVER TORTURING AND TORMENTING HIM
SHE SEEMS AS FEARLESS AS A MODERN UNA
AND UNLESS HE'S A FOOL HE MUST BE FAR AWAY FROM HERE BY THIS TIME AND THEN WHAT IS THERE TO TRACE HIM BY--THAT'S TO SAY UNLESS YOU COULD IDENTIFY THE MONEY OR WATCH AND CHAIN OR WHAT NOT WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD ABOUT HIM MR DUNBAR SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO MISTAKE THE DOOR LEADING TO THEM
PEOPLE DISPUTED AS TO WHETHER THE BRIDE OR BRIDEGROOM WAS HANDSOMEST
OH NO FATHER I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ONLY ONLY WHAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE AS HE SPOKE ARTHUR LOVELL THOUGHT OF LAURA DUNBAR
IT IS OUR MISFORTUNE PERHAPS
I AM A RICH MAN AND KNOW HOW TO RECOMPENSE THOSE WHO PLEASE ME
EVERY DAY AND EVERY HOUR I HAVE REMEMBERED IT
AND BEING OH SO FAITHFULLY NURSED AND CARED FOR BY THAT BLESSED DAUGHTER OF HIS
THERE ARE LOW OLD-FASHIONED HOUSES WITH TUDOR WINDOWS AND PONDEROUS PORCHES GREY GABLES CROWNED WITH YELLOW STONE-MOSS HIGH GARDEN-WALLS QUEER NOOKS AND CORNERS DEEP WINDOW-SEATS IN PAINTED ORIELS GREAT OAKEN BEAMS SUPPORTING LOW DARK CEILINGS HEAVY CLUSTERS OF CHIMNEYS HALF BORNE DOWN BY THE WEIGHT OF THE IVY THAT CLINGS ABOUT THEM
I THINK NOT REPLIED MR BALDERBY RISING FROM BEFORE HIS DESK
BUT SHE GREW CALMER PRESENTLY AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE YES YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHTLY MR AUSTIN
HE LISTENED BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF VOICES OR FOOTSTEPS
MR HENRY'S REGIMENT WAS QUARTERED AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE AND THE YOUNG MAN WAS VERY OFTEN AT THIS OFFICE IN AND OUT IN AND OUT SOMETIMES TWICE AND THREE TIMES A WEEK
YOU THINK YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE THE PORTRAIT YES SURELY
I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE MY DAUGHTER
I SUPPOSE I MUST BE SATISFIED CLEMENT SHE SAID
IT'S A NAPOLEONIC BEGINNING
I SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF LIGHT THERE
AT SIX O'CLOCK HE DINED STILL KEEPING TO HIS OWN ROOM--FOR HE WAS NOT WELL ENOUGH TO DINE WITH HIS DAUGHTER HE SAID
WHILE THE COUNTRY IS RINGING WITH THE RECORD OF A GREAT CRIME--WHILE THE MURDERER IS ON HIS GUARD NIGHT AND DAY WAKING AND SLEEPING--THE POLICE WATCH AND WORK
YOU MAY AS WELL CALL ME MAJOR VERNON
SHE WAS TORTURED BY REMORSEFUL THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FATHERLESS CHILD WHO HAD BEEN SO RUTHLESSLY BANISHED FROM HER
SHE HAD HEARD CLEMENT AUSTIN SPEAK OF A BRIDLE-PATH THROUGH THE PARK TO LISFORD AND HE HAD TOLD HER THAT THIS BRIDLE-PATH WAS APPROACHED BY A GATE IN THE PARK-FENCE UPWARDS OF A MILE FROM THE PRINCIPAL LODGE
THE LAST ENTRY WAS THE ONLY MEMORANDUM THAT HAD ANY INTEREST FOR HIM
I KNOW NOW THAT YOU LOVE ME AND I WILL NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM EXCEPT AS YOUR PLIGHTED HUSBAND HEAVEN HELP ME MURMURED JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER
IT'S WELL WORTH SEEING BUT HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
HIS FATHER WAS VERY LIBERAL TO HIM
MRS MADDEN WHO WAS COMPANION HOUSEKEEPER AND CONFIDENTIAL MAID TO HER CHARMING YOUNG MISTRESS WAS OFFICIATING AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE
HE SAT WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE PAGE BEFORE HIM THINKING OF MARGARET WENTWORTH
OF COURSE YOU ARE FREE TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF
HE DESCENDED FROM THE FLY HIMSELF IN ORDER TO QUESTION THE WOMAN AT THE LODGE
HE WAS ONE OF THE CLEVEREST CHAPS AT COUNTERFEITING ANY MAN'S HANDWRITING THAT WAS EVER TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY
BUT HE LOVED HER STILL
FORGIVE ME MY GIRL
AND THERE WAS A VAGUE REPORT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DEAD MAN HAD BEEN SEEN THERE WALKING IN THE TWILIGHT
GOING AWAY--TO-DAY--THIS MORNING YES BY THE HALF-PAST NINE O'CLOCK TRAIN MARGARET YOU MUST BE MAD TO TALK OF SUCH A THING NO THE GIRL ANSWERED SLOWLY
WELL EXCLAIMED HENRY DUNBAR
OH DEAR NO THE BOY SAID
BUT I THINK IF MISS DUNBAR HAD BEEN LESS INTELLIGENT HER INSTRUCTOR WOULD HAVE HAD PATIENCE WITH HER AND WOULD HAVE STILL FOUND HIS BEST DELIGHT BENEATH THE SHADOW OF THOSE DEAR OLD ELMS
BUT I REALLY COULD SCARCELY ACT OTHERWISE
IT WAS VERY CRUEL OF HIM TO DECEIVE ME ARTHUR LOVELL WAS A SORRY COMFORTER
THE OTHER YOUNG MAN RAN OFF TO GET SOME OF THE BOAT'S TACKLE AND A COUPLE OF SHAGGY OVERCOATS
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO DO WITH JOSEPH WILMOT THE DETECTIVE HAD NEVER LOOSED HIS HAND FROM THE FUR COLLAR OF HIS PRISONER'S COAT
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE THAT'S ALL
DORA MACMAHON'S COLOUR WENT AND CAME AS SHE LOOKED AT THAT EARNEST COUNTENANCE AND THE FINGERS WHICH WERE ABSENTLY TURNING THE LEAVES OF HER BOOK WERE FAINTLY TREMULOUS
AND HE'S AFRAID TO SEE ME THE MAGISTRATE SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY
IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY REACHED THE GREAT IRON GATES OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY IN A FLY WHICH THEY HAD CHARTERED AT SHORNCLIFFE
HOW DIFFERENT EVERYTHING IS EXCLAIMED LAURA WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER
THE QUAINT CROSS THE LOW STONE COLONNADE THE SOLEMN TOWERS OF THE CATHEDRAL GAVE AN ANCIENT ASPECT TO THE QUIET CITY
THAT WAS A QUESTION WHOSE ANSWER WAS HIDDEN IN THE TRAVELLER'S OWN BREAST
THE PRINCIPAL TABLE WAS LAID FOR DINNER
MARGARET FOLLOWED HER FATHER NOT CLOSELY BUT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WATCHING HIM WITH ANXIOUS WONDERING EYES
REMEMBER HE WAS ONLY A LAD AND I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT IT A FINE THING TO OBLIGE HIS GENEROUS-HEARTED YOUNG MASTER
IT'S A PRINCELY BEGINNING
FOR IT WAS HERE THAT HE BANISHED HIS OWN FAILURES
THE COUNTRY WAS ALL SO MUCH ALIKE UNDER ITS THICK SHROUD OF SNOW THAT MR DUNBAR TRIED IN VAIN TO DISTINGUISH ANY LANDMARKS UPON THE WAY
I'LL GO AND LOOK FOR A DOCTOR CLEMENT HURRIED DOWN TO THE HALL OF THE HOTEL WHILE HIS MOTHER WENT TO SEEK MARGARET
THE SECRET POSSESSED AND NO DOUBT TRADED UPON BY JOSEPH WILMOT
THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACE DIDN'T PLEASE HIM
THE TRAIN WAS TO REACH RUGBY AT TEN MINUTES TO SIX
AND AS HE NEVER ENCOUNTERED THE FAIR SEX EXCEPT IN THE PERSON OF THE BARMAID AT A SPORTING PUBLIC HE WAS NOT CALLED UPON TO UNBONNET HIMSELF IN CEREMONIOUS OBEISANCE TO LOVELY WOMAN
THE SCRUTINIZING GLANCE OF ARTHUR LOVELL
I FORGIVE HIM THE LANGUID YOUTH VERY MUCH IN THE BACKGROUND AND QUITE SHELTERED BY HIS MASTER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD MURMURING FAINTLY OH INDEED
ONLY SUCH YOUNG LADIES AS YOU DON'T OFTEN COME ACROSS EM
SHE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT IN HER MIND THE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER'S WRONGS
OR HE MIGHT HIDE IT JUST WHILE HE WAS IN HERE
YOU WILL SELL YOUR COMMISSION AND SAIL FOR CALCUTTA BY THE NEXT SHIP THAT LEAVES SOUTHAMPTON
THE REVELATION OF THAT SECRET WHICH YOU HOLD RESPECTING THE FORGED BILLS WOULD BRING DISGRACE NOT ONLY UPON HIM BUT UPON HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE
HE RAN ALMOST ALL THE WAY TO THE LITTLE INN
AND THAT SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE SICKLY PALLOR OF MR DUNBAR'S FACE CHANGED TO AN AWFUL LIVID HUE
AND ARTHUR LOVELL RESIGNED HIMSELF TO A PERPETUAL RESIDENCE IN THAT QUIET TOWN
BUT I COULDN'T
IT GREW SO DARK AND FOGGY TOWARDS ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT A DOZEN OR SO OF WAX-CANDLES WERE HASTILY STUCK ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE ALTAR IN ORDER THAT THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM MIGHT BE ABLE EACH OF THEM TO SEE THE PERSON THAT HE OR SHE WAS TAKING FOR BETTER OR WORSE
I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU MY MOTIVES FOR LEAVING THE BANKING-HOUSE AT SOME FUTURE TIME DEAR MOTHER HE SAID
OH DORA I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT I SHOULD BE SO HAPPY IF ARTHUR LOVELL AND YOU WERE TO MARRY MISS MACMAHON BLUSHED A MUCH DEEPER RED THAN BEFORE
THIS WOMAN IS SOME IMPUDENT IMPOSTOR WHO WANTS TO EXTORT MONEY OUT OF ME
WE'RE EIGHT MINUTES BEHIND OUR TIME AND I SEE THE DANGER-SIGNAL UP YONDER AND THE LINE SEEMS BLOCKED UP WITH SNOW AND I REALLY FEAR HE LOOKED OUT AGAIN AND THEN DREW IN HIS HEAD VERY SUDDENLY
I ONLY CAME UP TO TOWN TO ACT AS MISS DUNBAR'S ESCORT INDEED THAT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU
I WAS STILL AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND WHY HE ATTACHED SO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE FINDING OF THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES
ONE DO INDEED PERHAPS THE VERGER HAD FAINT HOPES OF ANOTHER HALF SOVEREIGN FROM THIS VERY RICH GENTLEMAN
AND MR LOVELL HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN ATTENDING TO THE THREE YOUNG LADIES AND THE STOWING AWAY OF ALL THOSE BONNET-BOXES AND SHAWLS AND TRAVELLING-BAGS AND DESKS AND DRESSING-CASES AND ODD VOLUMES OF BOOKS AND UMBRELLAS PARASOLS AND SKETCHING-PORTFOLIOS WHICH ARE THE PECULIAR ATTRIBUTES OF ALL FEMALE TRAVELLERS
THIS MAN NEVER HAD BEEN AND NEVER COULD BE A COWARD
THIS DOUBTLESS WAS ONLY THE FANCY OF AN INVALID
BUT HE DID NOT SLEEP
IT WAS A SPACIOUS AND HANDSOME CHAMBER THE BEST ROOM IN THE HOTEL
UPON THE AFTERNOON OF THE INQUEST THIS OFFICIAL HAD FOUND HIMSELF A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE
THE MAN WHO LOVES AT FIRST SIGHT GENERALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE VIOLET BLUE OF A PAIR OF TENDER EYES THE DELICATE OUTLINE OF A GRECIAN NOSE
BUT WHAT WAS IT NOW THAT YOU COULD HAVE SAID AT THE INQUEST IF YOU HAD BEEN CALLED AS A WITNESS WELL SIR I'LL TELL YOU
THAT HEART DID BEAT
I SUPPOSE THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF SOMETHING BETTER AND YOU ARE READY TO GIVE US THE GO-BY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES SAID MR BALDERBY WITH A TONE OF PIQUE
WE'RE GOING TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SHORNCLIFFE THAT WANTS HIS WILL ALTERED ALL OF A HURRY HAVING QUARRELLED WITH HIS THREE DAUGHTERS
WERE THE WINGS THAT HAD FLUTTERED IN SO MANY FLAMES BURNT AND MAIMED BY THE FIRST BREATH OF THIS NEW FIRE
NOTHING IS FARTHER FROM MY THOUGHTS THAN ANY SUCH DESIGN HE SAID
MY DEAR INDULGENT MOTHER REMONSTRATED
I HAVE LENT MARGARET SOME OF MY BOOKS
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY-LOOKING GIRL BUT FOR HER TOOTHACHE OR RATHER BUT FOR THE COLOURED HANDKERCHIEF WHICH MUFFLED THE LOWER PART OF HER FACE AND WAS TIED IN A KNOT AT THE TOP OF HER HEAD
LEAST OF ALL BY YOU
MR DUNBAR MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED OF THE VERY SPIRIT OF ORDER AND PRECISION
HENRY DUNBAR AND ARTHUR LOVELL SLEPT AT THE SAME HOTEL UPON THE NIGHT OF THEIR JOURNEY FROM WINCHESTER TO LONDON
BUT THOUGH I SAW HIM LOOK AT ME WISTFULLY ONCE OR TWICE HE DID NOT SPEAK TO ME UNTIL HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A LETTER ON THE MANTELPIECE
HIS BREATH CAME SHORT AND THICK AS HE THOUGHT OF THIS
AND I EXPECT THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME HE CAME TO GET MONEY OR TO ASK FOR IT
ASK MR AUSTIN TO BRING THE DAILY BALANCE AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS LEDGERS HE SAID TO THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED HIS SUMMONS
STAY
ONE RESOLUTION WAS ALWAYS UPPERMOST IN HER MIND EVEN WHEN SHE WAS HAPPIEST WITH HER NEW FRIENDS
INDEED I THOUGHT THAT HIS IMMEDIATE ARREST WAS ALMOST A CERTAINTY
SHE IS TOO PURE AND BEAUTIFUL FOR THE HARD STRUGGLES OF THIS WORLD MARGARET WENTWORTH WALKED RAPIDLY ALONG THE ROAD THAT LED HER BACK TO WANDSWORTH
IN THE LITTLE ENCLOSURE BELOW THE GRAND STAND THE BETTING MEN--THAT STRANGE FRATERNITY WHICH APPEARS ON EVERY RACECOURSE FROM BERWICK-ON-TWEED TO THE LAND'S-END FROM THE BANKS OF THE SHANNON TO THE SMOOTH MEADS OF PLEASANT NORMANDY--WERE GATHERED THICK AND THE TALK WAS LOUD ABOUT SIR PHILIP AND HIS COMPETITORS
GOOD MORNING HE LEFT THE DIAMOND-MERCHANT WONDERING AT HIS SANG FROID AND RETURNED TO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM ALL THIS TIME
FOR PITY'S SAKE DON'T DETAIN ME MR AUSTIN
HE WAS A BANKER HEART AND SOUL AND HE DID NOT AT ALL RELISH THE IDEA OF ANY WITHDRAWAL OF THE BANK'S RESOURCES HOWEVER FIRM THAT ESTABLISHMENT MIGHT STAND
THE CORONER'S INQUEST WHICH HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE PLACE AT NOON THAT DAY WAS POSTPONED UNTIL THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EARNEST REQUEST OF HENRY DUNBAR
THEY DID USE ME TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT AND LEFT ME IN THE LURCH WHEN DANGER CAME
THIS MAN WAS SAMPSON WILMOT THE OLD CONFIDENTIAL CLERK IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
WE'VE HAD OUR EYE ON YOU FOR A LONG TIME MR VALLANCE
ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF CATCHING COLD
I FEEL NO SENSE OF FATIGUE BUT YOU WILL TRY TO GET SOME REST TO PLEASE ME
THERE WAS A WOODEN BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER AND THERE WERE TWO OPPOSITE ENTRANCES TO THE CHURCHYARD
THERE MAY BE NO NECESSITY FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT
MAJOR VERNON HAD RISEN RESPLENDENT AS THE PHOENIX FROM THE ASHES OF HIS OLD CLOTHES
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE MEMBER BECAUSE MY MEMORY ISN'T QUITE SO GOOD AS IT USED TO BE
SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A MILLIONAIRE AND YOU FEAR HER FATHER'S DISAPPROVAL OF YOUR PRETENSIONS EH NO MR DUNBAR
THE MORE I THINK OF THIS THE STRONGER BECOMES MY CONVICTION THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN THE DUPE OF A HEARTLESS OR MERCENARY WOMAN
MR DUNBAR WENT IN UNANNOUNCED
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD JOSEPH--I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD AND GONE AND WISHED IT I DARE SAY THE OTHER ANSWERED BITTERLY
THERE WERE FIELDS UPON THIS SPOT WHEN I WENT TO INDIA THEY SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST
LET THE HISTORY OF YOUR UNHAPPY FATHER'S LIFE REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN YOU AND ME
AND I FANCY YOU MUST HAVE GONE DOWN IN THE WORLD SINCE I KNEW YOU IF I MAY JUDGE FROM APPEARANCES THE BYSTANDERS WHO HAD LISTENED TO EVERY WORD BEGAN TO MURMUR AMONG THEMSELVES
THEY WALKED AWAY SILENTLY STILL ARM-IN-ARM TOWARDS THE SHADY GROVES AND SPREADING PASTURES BEYOND THE CATHEDRAL PRECINCTS
THE WINCHESTER MURDER IS FORGOTTEN AMONGST THE MANY OTHER GUILTY MYSTERIES WHICH ARE NEVER ENTIRELY SOLVED
BUT THAT CONSIDERATION MUST NOT HINDER THE COURSE OF JUSTICE
WHEN IN THE DARKENING OF THE EARTHLY PROSPECT WE FANCY THAT WE SEE A SHADOWY CURTAIN CLOSING ROUND AN UNKNOWN FUTURE
HE AGAIN DECLARED THAT HE WOULD RATHER REMAIN IN PRISON THAN ACCEPT HIS LIBERTY ON SUFFERANCE AND GO OUT INTO THE WORLD A SUSPECTED MAN
MY LOVE IS A STRONGER PASSION THAN YOU THINK MADGE
INSIDE THE LID THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER UPON WHICH THE FOLLOWING LINES WERE WRITTEN IN THE DEAR HAND THE NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN HAND
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE IN THE PAPER TO READ
HE MIGHT DO THAT BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE HE LAUGHED ALOUD AGAIN AND WALKED ON BRISKLY
AND IF I FIND MARGARET HAS LEFT BY THAT WAY I CAN GET THE FLY ROUND THERE AND PICK HER UP BETWEEN THIS AND SHORNCLIFFE
DIAMONDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF ROYALTY AND ARE AS WELL KNOWN AS THE FAMILY THEY'VE BELONGED TO
I WAS ASHAMED OF MY SILLY FANCY IN ONE MOMENT AND PROUD OF MY LOVE IN THE NEXT
THERE IS NOT A MOMENT--NOT ONE MOMENT SHE STOPPED WITH HER HANDS CLASPED UPON HER BREAST
IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN THE BANKER OPENED THE HALL-DOOR AND PASSED OUT WITH THE MAJOR UPON THE BROAD STONE FLAGS UNDER THE GOTHIC PORCH
IT WAS NOT A VERY LARGE HOUSE FOR MOST OF THE OLDER PART OF IT HAD FALLEN INTO RUIN LONG AGO AND THE RUINED TOWERS AND SHATTERED WALLS HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY
THE BOY WHO HAD FETCHED BEER HAD A BASKET
NO SHE CRIED AS THE YOUNG MAN BARRED HER PASSAGE TO THE DOOR
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE NO OFFENCE NO MUTTERED MR WILMOT
SHE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION FROM HIM
SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DEFEND HIM WHEN PEOPLE SPOKE AGAINST HIM
IF YOU WERE SO PRECIOUS FOND OF ME HOW WAS IT THAT YOU STOPPED IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR AND DUNBAR
HE WAS A CHESTNUT HORSE WITH A COAT THAT SHONE LIKE SATIN AND NOT A WHITE HAIR ABOUT HIM
INDEED THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO FARTHER AND SAY THEY HAVE SEEN HIM IN AMERICA
AFTER FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS VIII
MAJOR VERNON LAID HIS BONY FINGERS UPON HENRY DUNBAR'S SHOULDER AND STOPPED HIM BEFORE HE COULD CROSS THE THRESHOLD
I THINK I'LL GO INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND PUT MY PAPERS TO RIGHTS MOTHER I SAID
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
THE LAD HAS COME BACK SIR
BUT THE ANGLO-INDIAN MOTIONED HIM TO SILENCE WITH A HAUGHTY GESTURE
POOR LONELY GIRL
IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT CLEMENT AUSTIN'S FRIENDLY VOICE RAISED AN UNWONTED EMOTION IN HER BREAST
THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY ISN'T THE PLEASANTEST TIME IN THE YEAR FOR A TRIP INTO THE COUNTRY CLEM DEAR SHE SAID
I LEAVE HER IN YOUR CARE UNDER PROVIDENCE
IT IS ONE THING TO RIDE INTO THE LISTS ON A PRANCING STEED CAPARISONED WITH EMBROIDERED TRAPPINGS WORKED BY THE FAIR HANDS OF YOUR LADY-LOVE AND WITH THE TRUMPETS BRAYING AND THE POPULACE SHOUTING AND THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY SMILING SWEET APPROVAL OF YOUR PROWESS
BUT FROM THE LOOKS OF HER CAPTAIN I SHOULD SAY SHE'D CARRY ANYTHINK EVEN TO A CHURCHYARD FULL OF CORPUSES IF SHE WAS PAID TO DO IT HUMPH
IT WAS IN COMING HERE HE MET MY BROTHER WHO WAS A HANDSOME LAD--AY AS HANDSOME AND AS GENTLEMANLY A LAD AS THE YOUNG CORNET HIMSELF
THOSE GALS SPEND ALL THEIR EARNINGS IN FINERY AND FALLALS INSTEAD OF BEHAVING LIKE RESPECTABLE YOUNG WOMEN AND SAVING UP THEIR MONEY AGAINST THEY CAN GO INTO THE PUBLIC LINE WITH THE MAN OF THEIR CHOICE HE YAWNED AND WENT ON STARING AT THE ROOKS WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ANY FURTHER ABOUT THE IMPERTINENT YOUNG PERSON WHO HAD DARED TO PRESENT HERSELF AT THE GRAND ENTRANCE
BUT I SUPPOSE THE WORST SINNERS HAVE SOME KIND OF CONSCIENCE
IT WAS PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE THREE MEN--THE DETECTING THE WINCHESTER CONSTABLE AND MYSELF--ENTERED OUR SITTING-ROOM AT THE GEORGE HOTEL
AND THEN THE EXAMINATION WAS ADJOURNED AND THE PRISONER REMANDED ALTHOUGH ARTHUR LOVELL CONTENDED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY HIS DETENTION
IT STRUCK ME THAT YOU MUST THEREFORE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER BE INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THE MURDERED MAN
HAVEN'T I RUN ALL OVER CLAPHAM BRIXTON AND WANDSWORTH--TO SAY NOTHING OF AN OCCASIONAL INCURSION UPON PUTNEY--IN ORDER TO PROCURE YOU HALF-A-DOZEN PUPILS
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW MANY DIFFERENT THOUGHTS WERE BUSY IN HIS RESTLESS BRAIN THAT NIGHT
AND IN FEW AND SIMPLE WORDS RELATED THE STORY OF HER LIFE
IF MR DUNBAR WAS INNOCENT AND HAD CONTRIVED SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO CONVINCE THE YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS INNOCENCE WHY SHE'D HAVE COME TO YOU FREE AND OPEN AND WOULD HAVE SAID MY DEAR I'VE MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT MR DUNBAR AND I'M VERY SORRY FOR IT
HE WAS IN A PASSION BUT GRIEF AND INDIGNATION WERE SO INTERMINGLED IN HIS BREAST THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW WHICH WAS UPPERMOST
GO BACK TO HER AND SEND THE FLY FOR ME BY-AND-BY NONSENSE MADGE
THE GIRL'S FACE CLOUDED WITH A LOOK OF SORROWFUL PERPLEXITY THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE ELOQUENT WITH TENDER MEANING
THE TRAIN CAME INTO THE STATION AT THIS MOMENT
AND THE SOUND OF PICKAXES AND SHOVELS ALMOST DROWNED THOSE OTHER DREADFUL SOUNDS THE PITEOUS MOANS OF SUFFERERS WHO WERE SO LITTLE HURT AS TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR SUFFERINGS
BUT THE BANKER DECLARED THAT THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH ALTOGETHER UNFITTED HIM FOR SOCIETY
AND YOU COME IN WITHOUT MARGARET AND SEEM ALARMED AT NOT SEEING NET HERE
GO AND SIN AFRESH
AFTER OFFICE HOURS IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY II
HE WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THINKING WHILST HIS MOTHER WATCHED HIM VERY ANXIOUSLY
BUT IT'LL MATTER A GOOD DEAL TO YOU CAPTAIN SPELSAND IF YOU RESIST MY AUTHORITY THE CAPTAIN HESITATED FOR A LITTLE WHILE HE GAVE A FEW FIERCE PUFFS AT HIS DIRTY PIPE
I SUPPOSE THAT FELLOW VALLANCE HAS GOT INTO SOME KIND OF TROUBLE AND HAS COME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT TO HOUND ME FOR MONEY
I HAD DONE NOTHING TO IMPEDE THE COURSE OF JUSTICE THOUGH I HAD KNOWN FULL WELL THAT THE PUNISHMENT OF THE EVIL-DOER WOULD CRUSH THE BRAVEST AND PUREST HEART THAT EVER BEAT IN AN INNOCENT WOMAN'S BOSOM
THROUGH THE NARROW OPENING BETWEEN THE FOLDING-DOORS SHE HAD SEEN THE PICTURES AND THE STATUES GLIMMERING IN THE LAMPLIGHT OF THE INNER HALL
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU THAT FOR WHICH MOST MEN ARE READY TO BARTER PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE,--I CAN GIVE YOU MONEY HOW MUCH ASKED JOSEPH WILMOT WITH A HALF-SUPPRESSED FIERCENESS IN HIS MANNER
HE MEASURED THESE ROUND HIS WAIST AND THEN BEGAN TO STITCH THEM TOGETHER SLOWLY AND LABORIOUSLY
HAS ANYTHING OCCURRED IN THE HOUSE THAT HAS MADE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE NO INDEED MR BALDERBY
HE PACKED THE BOX IN PAPER AND MADE ME SEAL IT WITH MY SIGNET-RING IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE OF HIS CLERKS BEFORE HE PUT IT AWAY IN AN IRON SAFE NEAR HIS DESK
BUT WE MUST LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR MY POOR PA'S MURDERER BUT WHAT DOES THE YOUNG WOMAN DO
HOW IS THIS MONEY INVESTED ASKED HENRY DUNBAR POINTING TO THE PAGE
I SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT YOU HAD HALF A MIND TO SHOW ME THAT LETTER
I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK IT HE SAID
PERHAPS YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO WAIT HERE AND TELL HIM TO FOLLOW ME MR DUNBAR WENT AWAY STILL MUTTERING AND THE VERGER GAVE UP ALL THOUGHTS OF HIS TEA AND WAITED CONSCIENTIOUSLY
CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD PROMISED MARGARET TO WAIT FOR HER AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY
GOOD-BYE DEAR AND GENEROUS FRIEND
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE TIME YOU TRIED TO GET OFF JOHN BOWMAN THE CLERK THAT ROBBED THE YORKSHIRE UNION ASSURANCE OFFICE--DON'T YOU REMEMBER TRYING TO GET HIM OFF CLEAR AND GETTIN INTO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT MR SPELSAND BAWLED SOME ORDER TO THE MAN AT THE HELM AND THE VESSEL VEERED ROUND SUDDENLY
HIS NOSE WAS AQUILINE HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND SQUARE HIS CHIN MASSIVE
THE HOTEL WAS SITUATED IN A NEW STREET AT THE WEST END
YOU'RE AN OUTCAST
HENRY DUNBAR SAT DOWN AND WROTE THE FOLLOWING LINES
LATEST PARTICULARS MARGARET WENTWORTH READ THAT HORRIBLE STORY
TILL BY-AND-BY HE GREW TO THINK OF HENRY DUNBAR AS HE WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER LINKED BY A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE FORGING OF THE BILLS AND ALL THE TROUBLE THAT FOLLOWED
I'VE BROUGHT YOU THE CUP LAURA
LAURA DUNBAR XI
AND A SOJOURN AT THE DOLPHIN IS ALMOST A RECOMPENSE FOR THE PAINS AND PENALTIES OF THE VOYAGE HOME FROM INDIA
HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOW IN THE HABIT OF RISING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE DAY AT WHICH TIME HE WAS ASSISTED FROM HIS BEDROOM TO HIS SITTING-ROOM WHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL SEVEN OR EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
I SPOKE TO HER PAR ABOUT IT ONLY THE OTHER DAY
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BENT FORWARD AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
IF THE DECEASED HAD NO CLAIM UPON YOU WHY DID YOU PROMISE HIM AN ANNUITY HE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE
BUT WHATEVER HER FEARS MIGHT BE SHE WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH HER LOVER'S PROMISE THAT THIS SHOULD BE HIS LAST STEEPLE-CHASE
CLEMENT RAN TO MEET HER WITH HIS FACE LIGHTED UP BY THAT INTENSE DELIGHT WHICH A MAN FEELS WHEN SOME INTOLERABLE FEAR IS SUDDENLY LIFTED OFF HIS MIND
IF SHE RETURNS MY LOVE MY STRUGGLES WILL BE SWEET TO ME FOR THEY WILL BE MADE FOR HER SAKE
MR DUNBAR'S GROOM SLEPT IN A PART OF THE HOUSE NEAR THIS LOOSE BOX
EVERY VESTIGE OF COLOUR FADED OUT OF LAURA'S FACE AS SHE RECOGNIZED THE JUNIOR PARTNER OF THE BANKING-HOUSE
HEAVEN KEEP OUR MEMORIES GREEN
THE OTHER STATION WAS SAFE SO LONG AS MR TIBBLES REMAINED ON THE WATCH THERE
HE ONLY SHRANK HAUGHTILY AWAY FROM THE MAJOR'S TOUCH AS IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME INFECTION TO BE DREADED FROM THOSE DIRTY FINGER-TIPS
AND SHE SMILED APPROVINGLY AT THE YOUNG MAN
HE SAT WITH HIS ELBOW RESTING UPON THE ARM OF HIS EASY-CHAIR AND HIS FACE SHADED BY HIS HAND AND HAD NOT ONCE SPOKEN
BY PRACTISED MEN WHO HAVE STUDIED THE PHILOSOPHY OF CRIME AND WHO BY REASON OF THEIR PECULIAR SKILL ARE ABLE TO READ DARK MEANINGS IN WORDS AND LOOKS THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIKE A STRANGE LANGUAGE
THE BANKER HAD WELCOMED HIS DEAD WIFE'S ELDER DAUGHTER WITH A SPEECH WHICH IF A LITTLE STUDIED IN ITS TONE WAS AT ANY RATE VERY KIND IN ITS MEANING
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY I DESPAIR OF NOTHING IF I DARE HOPE FOR YOUR LOVE
HE IS EITHER A VERY GREAT MAN OR A VERY WICKED ONE
THERE WAS FALSEHOOD AND TREACHERY IN THE BUSINESS BUT MARGARET WILMOT WAS NEITHER FALSE NOR TREACHEROUS
BRING ME SOME BRANDY THE GIRL BROUGHT A SMALL DECANTER OF SPIRIT AND A WINE-GLASS SET THEM ON THE TABLE AND LEFT THE ROOM
FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED ALMOST AS IF HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN
THERE WAS A QUEENLINESS IN HER BEAUTY WHICH SHE INHERITED FROM HER MOTHER'S HIGH-BORN RACE
CLEMENT AUSTIN LOCKED AT HIM ASTONISHED BY THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER
THE CASE WAS CLEAR AND PLAIN NOW AND THE YOUNG MAN'S DUTY WAS NO LONGER LOATHSOME TO HIM
NO PUNCTILIOUS OLD BACHELOR THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST HOURS OF WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CARES OF THE TOILET COULD HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE FASTIDIOUS THAN THIS VAGABOND WHO HAD BEEN OUT-AT-ELBOWS FOR TEN YEARS PAST AND WHO HAD WORN A FELON'S DRESS FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AT A STRETCH IN NORFOLK ISLAND
THE STATION-MASTER GAVE HIM ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRAINS
SELL MY COMMISSION HE CRIED
BUT TO HER SURPRISE MR KERSTALL TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF HER INQUIRY BUT WENT RAMBLING ON ABOUT THE DEGENERACY OF MODERN ART
AND UPON SUCH OCCASIONS THOUGH HE WOULD NOW AND THEN CONDESCEND TO LAY THE ODDS AGAINST ANYTHING WITH SOME UNCONSCIOUS AGRICULTURALIST OR VILLAGE TRADESMAN HIS INNOCENCE WITH REGARD TO ALL TURF MATTERS WAS POSITIVELY REFRESHING
AT THE END OF THE WEEK HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING THE SURGEON TO AGREE TO HIS REMOVAL
WHAT A COLD HAND YOU'VE GOT
BUT--YOU MUST PAY FOR THEM--YOU MUST PAY FOR THEM HENRY DUNBAR THIS LITTLE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE NEW TENANT OF WOODBINE COTTAGE AND HIS HOUSEKEEPER OCCURRED ON THE VERY EVENING ON WHICH MAJOR VERNON TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS NEW ABODE
I DON'T CRICK MY NECK OR BREAK MY BACK BY LOOKING INTO ANY MORE OF YOUR CUPBOARDS
I ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS QUITE READY TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
HE LIVES AT SHORNCLIFFE WITH HIS FATHER JOHN LOVELL WHO IS ALSO A SOLICITOR AND A MAN OF SOME STANDING IN THE COUNTY
HE UNWOUND THREE OR FOUR YARDS OF DINGY WOOLLEN STUFF FROM HIS SCRAGGY THROAT TURNED DOWN THE POODLE COLLAR PULLED HIS CHAIR CLOSE TO THE TABLE SQUARED HIS BROWS AND BEGAN BUSINESS
THE DETECTIVE WAS QUITE DOWN-HEARTED NOW
HE LOVED HER WITH A CHIVALROUS DEVOTION WHICH AFTER ALL IS AS NATURAL TO THE BREAST OF A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN IN THESE MODERN DAYS MISCALLED DEGENERATE AS WHEN THE SPOTLESS KNIGHT KING ARTHUR LOVED AND WOOED HIS QUEEN
SHE IS FOND OF HIM AND WILL BE RULED BY HIM
I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU'D MAKE A FIRST-CLASS DETECTIVE IN NEXT TO NO TIME I FELT RATHER DOUBTFUL AS TO THE MEANING OF THIS COMPLIMENT FOR THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE IRONY IN MR CARTER'S TONE
SUPERSTITION IS AFTER ALL ONLY A DIM UNCONSCIOUS POETRY WHICH IS LATENT IN MOST NATURES EXCEPT IN SUCH VERY HARD PRACTICAL MINDS AS ARE INCAPABLE OF BELIEVING IN ANYTHING--NOT EVEN IN HEAVEN ITSELF
EVEN THE FIRE SEEMED ROUSED BY THE SOUND OF HER VOICE
BUT BY SOME STRANGE DEVILRY OR OTHER PECULIAR TO THE INCIDENTS OF A DREAM IT HAD BEEN ALWAYS HIDDEN FROM HER
AND UNLESS I'M VERY MUCH MISTAKEN THEY'RE WHAT I WANT
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING AT ALL LIKE IT YET THE OLD MAN LIFTED UP HIS BONY HAND AND POINTED TO THE PICTURE ON THE EASEL
YES I THINK SO DRESS YOURSELF DECENTLY THEN BEFORE YOU DO SO SAID THE BANKER
AND SHE FOUND THE REWARD OF HER DEVOTION
CLEMENT AUSTIN OPENED THE DOOR OF MR BALDERBY'S PARLOUR
THEY MAY SAY THAT IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME SPECIAL REASON FOR NOT SEEING HER INDEED MR LOVELL
THERE MY BOY
I BELIEVE IT IS GENERALLY PRETTY REGULAR
THEY ROWED CLOSE UNDER THE SIDE OF THE BLACK AND WICKED-LOOKING VESSEL AND THEN MR CARTER STANDING UP IN THE BOAT GAVE A YO-HO
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE MORTIFICATION TO THE HIGH-SPIRITED YOUNG MAN
AS YET SHE HAD SPOKEN OPENLY OF HER TROUBLE TO NO LIVING CREATURE SINCE THAT NIGHT UPON WHICH SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO GAIN ADMISSION TO MR DUNBAR'S HOUSE
AN OLD-FASHIONED CARVED OAK-CHAIR WITH A HIGH BACK AND CRIMSON-MOROCCO CUSHIONS
I AM GOING AT ONCE
BUT NO SHADOW COULD HIDE ITS SUDDEN BRIGHTNESS THE HAPPY RADIANCE WHICH LIT UP THAT CANDID COUNTENANCE AS MISS DUNBAR RECOGNIZED HER VISITOR
BUT I SHALL EXPECT MY CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT BEFORE WE CLOSE THE SHAFT AND RETIRE UPON THE PROFITS OF THE SPECULATION
THE NEW HOPE SENT A THRILL OF SUDDEN LIFE AND ENERGY THROUGH MY VEINS
NO WRETCHED COUNTRY GIRL HAD EVER CURSED HIS NAME BEFORE SHE CAST HERSELF INTO THE SULLEN WATERS OF A LONELY MILL-STREAM
OH SIR CRIED BETTY IT ISN'T ME
HIS COLD HARD VOICE TURNED MY BLOOD TO ICE
GOD HAD COMPASSION ON HIM AND GAVE HIM TIME TO REPENT THE END OF THE STORY THE EPILOGUE
HE RANG A SECOND TIME BEFORE ANYONE CAME BUT AFTER A DELAY OF ABOUT FIVE MINUTES A YOUNG WOMAN APPEARED WITH HER FACE TIED UP IN A COLOURED HANDKERCHIEF
WHY SUCH STUPID RHYMES AS THEM ARE ONLY MADE FOR VULGAR PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE BANNS PUT UP IN THE PARISH CHURCH
IT WAS TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT BY LONDON TIME AND THE SUMMER SUN HAD GONE DOWN LEAVING ALL THE LOW WESTERN SKY BATHED IN VIVID YELLOW LIGHT WHICH DEEPENED INTO CRIMSON AS I WATCHED IT
MY NAME WAS ENTERED FOR THIS RACE SIX MONTHS AGO YOU KNOW DEAR
CLEMENT STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS ALMOST PARALYZED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THE BUSINESS WAS NOW ENTIRELY HIS
SHE WAS LIKE SOME TALL WHITE LILY UNCONSCIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL UNCONSCIOUSLY GRAND
MISS BETSY IS TO HOLD HER TONGUE IS SHE
WAS THERE SOME COLD CHILL OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN STORE FOR ME AFTER ALL
THE TONE OF THIS SHABBY-LOOKING STRANGER WAS ALMOST ONE OF COMMAND
NO THANK YOU MISS INNOCENCE HE SAID
SO YOU'VE LEARNED THE WAY OF THE WORLD ALREADY HAVE YOU MY LAD SAID JOSEPH WILMOT BITTERLY
WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THE DINING-ROOM YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE TWO GIRLS AND AMUSE YOURSELF IN THEIR SOCIETY I HAVE NO DOUBT MR DUNBAR RANG THE BELL
WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME HE ASKED
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE FRENCH JEWELLERS CAN DO BEFORE I TRUST LADY JOCELYN'S NECKLACE INTO THE HANDS OF ENGLISH WORKMEN
BUT WHEN HE DID COME AT LAST IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS FATHER WAS A MAN OF STONE
HE SNIFFED AT THE HEELS OF THE MILLIONAIRE AND THEN LOOKED SLOWLY UPWARD AT THE MAN'S FACE WITH SOMBRE SULKY-LOOKING EYES AND BEGAN TO GROWL OMINOUSLY
SO HE STROLLED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UPON THE PLATFORM WATCHING THE BUSY PORTERS THE EAGER PASSENGERS RUSHING TO AND FRO AND MEDITATING AS TO WHERE HE SHOULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS AFTERNOON
I HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THAT HORRIBLE BUSINESS AT WINCHESTER
HE GAVE A VERY SIMPLE AND INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS LANDING AT SOUTHAMPTON
I DON'T WANT ANY DIAMONDS PAPA SHE WHISPERED
HOW LONG
THE BELL HAD BEEN RINGING WHILE LOVELL AND THE BANKER HAD STOOD UPON THE PLATFORM TALKING
AND MISS DUNBAR HAD THEREFORE NO BETTER COMPANION FOR HER RIDES THAN A GREY-HAIRED OLD GROOM WHO HAD RIDDEN BEHIND PERCIVAL DUNBAR FOR FORTY YEARS OR SO
YES MARGARET WILMOT SAID AFTER A PAUSE
I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF THE GOSPEL
THEY SHOUT ALOUD AS HE FLIES PAST THEM THE LONG STRIDE OF THE CHESTNUT SKIMMING OVER THE GROUND AND SPATTERING FRAGMENTS OF TORN GRASS AND PLOUGHED-UP EARTH ABOUT HIM AS HE GOES
THE MELVILLES WERE TO DRIVE HOME TO THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE IN THE AFTERNOON AND DORA MACMAHON WAS GOING WITH THEM
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO ME
HE LOOKED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW AND SOME OF EARTH'S PLEASANTEST PICTURES SPED BY HIM
AND THAT IDEA WAS A CONVICTION
I WON'T BE BALKED OF THIS MEETING--I WON'T BE BALKED
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO YES SIR PERFECTLY VERY WELL THEN
I OPENED IT WHEN THE WAITER HAD LEFT ME AND READ THE FOLLOWING LINES
BUT THERE ARE SOME LIMITS EVEN TO THE PATIENCE OF A LOVER THOUGH HE WERE THE VERIEST KNIGHT-ERRANT WHO WAS EVER EAGER TO SHIVER A LANCE OR HACK THE EDGE OF A BATTLE-AXE FOR LOVE OF HIS LIEGE LADY
CARELESSLY-DRAWN GROUPS THAT HE MEANT SOME DAY TO IMPROVE UPON
AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHTN'T CARE TO GO TO THAT THE LANDLORD COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM GLANCING FURTIVELY AT THE WHITE AND SHINING ASPECT OF THE CLOTH THAT COVERED THE SHARP KNEES OF HIS CUSTOMER WHICH WERE EXACTLY UNDER HIS EYES AS THE TWO MEN SAT OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER BESIDE THE SNUG LITTLE ROUND TABLE
I THOUGHT SHORNCLIFFE TOWN-'ALL WAS A-FIRE AT THE VERY LEAST FROM THE WAY YOU RUNG
TELL ME MRS AUSTIN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN JOSEPH WILMOT JOSEPH WILMOT REPEATED MARGARET SLOWLY
WAS THERE ANY DEEP DESIGN IN THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE?--THAT WAS THE QUESTION
IN SPITE OF THE GRAND CAPABILITIES FOR FALSEHOOD AND HYPOCRISY WHICH HAD BEEN DEVELOPED IN MY NATURE SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO ANSWER MY MOTHER'S QUESTION DELIBERATELY TO THE EFFECT THAT I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD MIND THE MUSIC-LESSONS MUCH
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MY FATHER SHE CRIED
MR CARTER SAT OPPOSITE ME ALL THE TIME LISTENING INTENTLY
THE BANKER HAD ESPECIALLY IMPRESSED THAT CONDITION UPON HIS DAUGHTER
THE END OF THE VISION WOKE CLEMENT WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK AND HE OPENED HIS EYES UPON THE COLD MORNING LIGHT WHICH SEEMED ESPECIALLY COLD IN THIS CHAMBER AT THE REINDEER WHERE THE PAPER ON THE WALLS WAS OF THE PALEST GREY AND EVERY CURTAIN OR DRAPERY OF A SPOTLESS WHITE
THE MAJOR PAUSED UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHAMBER AND GRAVELY CONTEMPLATED HIS FRIEND
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT YOU MIGHT STAY--UNTIL UNTIL WHAT ASKED THE ANGLO-INDIAN
TALK OF BEING BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN YOUR MOUTH MISS LAURA
THEY'RE TOO CLEVER FOR US SIR MR CARTER REMARKED TO ONE OF THE SCOTLAND-YARD OFFICIALS
HE RAN ROUND THE LOW GARDEN-FENCE TO THE BACK OF THE PREMISES WHERE THERE WAS A LITTLE WOODEN GATE PADLOCKED BUT SO LOW THAT HE VAULTED OVER IT EASILY AND WENT IN AMONGST THE BUDDING CURRANT-BUSHES THE NEAT GRAVEL-PATHS AND STRAWBERRY-BEDS THAT HAD BEEN ERST SO CHERISHED BY THE NAVAL COMMANDER
HE TOLD ME THAT HE CAME AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANOTHER PERSON
BUT SHE DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM HIM ALMOST AS SHE HAD SHRUNK FROM HIM IN THE CORRIDOR ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
MRS AUSTIN WENT TO CLEMENT TO CARRY HIM THESE GOOD TIDINGS
THE CORONER SAT AT THE TOP
AND MR CARTER'S REPUTATION WAS ALSO TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE
WHILE HENRY DUNBAR WENT BACK TO THE CLARENDON IN A COMMON HACK CAB WHICH HE PICKED UP IN CORNHILL
BROODING BROODING BROODING
HENRY DUNBAR HE SAID TO HIMSELF
MR DUNBAR'S AGITATION IN THE CATHEDRAL
SO BE IT MR AUSTIN
I HAVE EVEN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE HE MIGHT BE UNLIKE MY GRANDFATHER AND A LITTLE UNKIND TO ME SOMETIMES WHEN I VEXED OR TROUBLED HIM
NOW MOANING DREARILY WITH A LONG LOW WAILING MURMUR NOW SHRIEKING IN THE SHRILLY TONES OF AN ANGRY VIXEN
THE TRAVELLING-CARRIAGE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR
IS THERE ANY HOPE OF HIS RECOVERING JOSEPH ASKED EAGERLY AS THE DOCTOR WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM
THE CLERK'S LETTER SUGGESTED A MOTIVE PERHAPS AN ADEQUATE MOTIVE
I SAID AS THEY MIGHT BE FLASH THE YOUTH REMONSTRATED QUITE MEEKLY
BUT HER MANNER BETRAYED HER SUSPICIONS
IT DON'T DO FOR ME TO SIT STILL TOO LONG
I WILL WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD HERE AND WAIT FOR YOU BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG CLEMENT NO MATTER HOW LONG
WE CAN'T DO BETTER THAN PUT UP AT THE HOTEL WHERE THE SUSPECTED PARTY WAS STOPPING AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WE'RE LOOKING UP MR CARTER SAID TO ME AS WE STROLLED AWAY FROM THE STATION AFTER GIVING OUR SMALL AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE INTO THE CARE OF A PORTER
BUT UPON THE INFORMATION LAID BEFORE ME I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO DETAIN YOU UNTIL THE MATTER SHALL HAVE BEEN FURTHER INVESTIGATED
BUT HE BROUGHT MR DUNBAR HIS OFFICE INKSTAND AND LOOKED ON WITH AN APPROVING TWINKLE OF HIS EYES WHILE THE BANKER WROTE THE CHEQUE IN THAT SLOW FORMAL HAND PECULIAR TO HIM
AND I WILL SEND ONE OF THE WAITERS TO THE STATION SO THAT YOU MAY HAVE NO TROUBLE ABOUT YOUR LUGGAGE CLEMENT RANG THE BELL AND GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS
BUT AT LAST A MAN CAME OUT OF A FARMYARD WITH A COUPLE OF MILK-PAILS AND DIRECTED HER TO THE LISFORD ROAD
HE WAS HURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDOR BUT HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY FOR A WELL-KNOWN FIGURE APPEARED UPON THE BROAD LANDING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH THEREFORE NO SCANDAL NO PROSECUTION
AND DECANT IT CAREFULLY WHATEVER YOU DO
AND THE DRESSES OF THE LADIES IN THE HUMBLE WOODEN STRUCTURE WHICH DID DUTY AS A GRAND STAND BRIGHTENED THE LEVEL LANDSCAPE
HE LOOKED HENRY DUNBAR FULL IN THE FACE AS HE SPOKE
THE AUCTIONEER HAD BEEN AT FIRST A LITTLE DOUBTFUL OF THIS TALL SHABBY STRANGER IN THE NAPLESS DIRTY-WHITE BEAVER AND THE MANGY POODLE COLLAR
AND AGAIN THE SPORTING GENTLEMAN FROM LONDON HEARD OF HENRY DUNBAR'S RICHES
THE LANDLORD CAME TO WAIT UPON HIS GUEST
SHE RENOUNCED ME THEN RATHER THAN RENOUNCE THAT GUILTY WRETCH I THOUGHT
THIS CASCADE WAS FORTY FEET BELOW THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF UPON WHICH THE MANSION STOOD
HE WAS UTTERLY SELFISH AND HEARTLESS
YOU MUST BEGIN AGAIN AND BEGIN THIS TIME UPON THE LOWEST STEP OF THE LADDER
I'M ONLY A SORT OF MACHINE SIR--A MACHINE THAT'S PRETTY NEARLY WORN OUT I FANCY NOW--BUT AS LONG AS I LAST YOU CAN MAKE WHAT USE OF ME YOU LIKE SIR
WHO BROUGHT THIS PARCEL I ASKED STARTING FROM MY COMFORTABLE EASY-CHAIR AND GOING STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL
TRYING TO DECIPHER HALF-OBLITERATED INSCRIPTIONS UPON LONG-FORGOTTEN TOMBS
SHE HAD SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO PHILIP JOCELYN
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE EFFECT WOULD BE ANYTHING LIKE THIS
HE SAT A LITTLE WAY APART FROM THE TWO OTHERS WATCHING HENRY DUNBAR
MR DUNBAR CAME HERE THIS MORNING ON HORSEBACK BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX IT WAS TEN MINUTES PAST SIX SIR AND I WAS OPENING THE SHUTTERS PRECISELY AND THE GENTLEMAN CAME ON HORSEBACK SIR AND WAS NIGH UPON FAINTING WITH THE PAIN OF HIS LEG
TALL BROAD-CHESTED AND POWERFUL IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE IN HENRY DUNBAR'S APPEARANCE ANY ONE OF THE USUAL EVIDENCES OF ILL-HEALTH
BUT HE DID NOT READ HALF-A-DOZEN LINES
THAT THEY SHALL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DEEDS
HER MANNERS ARE AS MUCH CHANGED AS HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE
I SHALL NEVER MARRY HENRY AND YOU ARE MY ONLY NEPHEW AND MY ACKNOWLEDGED HEIR
HE SPENT AN HOUR AND A HALF IN WALKING ABOUT THE STREETS PRYING INTO ALL MANNER OF DINGY LITTLE BARS AND TAP-ROOMS IN NARROW BACK STREETS AND DOWN BY THE WATER-SIDE
EVERY ONE OF THE JURYMEN LOOKED SUDDENLY AT MR DUNBAR
MY FIRST THOUGHT IN ANY GREAT CRISIS OF MY LIFE WOULD BE TO GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THERE WERE NO LESS THAN FOUR DIFFERENT MEANS OF EXIT FROM THE PARK
A FREE MAN MADGE I THOUGHT
JOSEPH LEFT THE POOR OLD MAN SOMEWHERE UPON THE ROAD HE DID NOT SAY WHERE NO
SHE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ITS SPLENDOUR UPON THE NIGHT AFTER HER RETURN FROM WINCHESTER
IT WAS BETWEEN AN ELM AND A BEECH
FOR IN CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP MAJOR VERNON HAD PLENTY TO SAY FOR HIMSELF
BUT WHEN I TOLD HER OF MY BROKEN LIFE--WHEN IN THE EARNESTNESS OF MY PLEADING SHE PERCEIVED THE PROOF OF A CONSTANCY THAT NO TIME COULD SHAKE I COULD SEE THAT SHE WAVERED
WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS AND THRUST THE TORN LABELS INTO HIS POCKET HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SOFTLY WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED UPON HIS BREAST
THE MOONLIT FIGURE IN THE WINCHESTER STREET THE DUSKY SHADOW BENEATH THE DRIPPING BRANCHES IN THE GROVE
YOU SHALL SPEAK PLAINLY
EVEN THE TURKEY CARPET WAS IN THE VERY STAGE OF DUSKY DINGINESS THAT HAD DISTINGUISHED THE CARPET ON WHICH HENRY DUNBAR HAD STOOD FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS BEFORE
CONSPICUOUS AMONGST THE VEHICLES THERE WAS A CLOSE CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A PAIR OF MAGNIFICENT BAYS--AN EQUIPAGE WHICH WAS ONLY SPLENDID IN THE PERFECTION OF ITS APPOINTMENTS
OH BY THE BYE HE SAID PAUSING UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR I'LL THANK YOU TO BUNDLE ALL THOSE OLD THINGS OF MINE TOGETHER INTO A SHEET OF BROWN PAPER
IT WAS WHILE HE WAS READING THE LETTER FOR THE LAST TIME THAT I SAW A SUDDEN GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN HIS HARD EYES AND A HALF-SMILE PLAYING ROUND HIS THIN LIPS
SOME FOOLISH GAMBLING TRANSACTION IN THE EARLY YOUTH OF HENRY DUNBAR
IT WAS IN THE YEAR 15 SIR AND OUR HOUSE HAD DONE WONDERS ON CHANGE
OH A LONG TIME AGO--A VERY LONG WAY OFF PERHAPS IT WAS--SOMEWHERE IN INDIA--UP THE COUNTRY SAID THE BANKER VERY SLOWLY
SO HAPPY IN THOSE PLEASANT MEETINGS UNDER THE MAUDESLEY ELMS THAT NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING SO COMMONPLACE AS A STEREOTYPED PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE HAD A PLACE IN HIS MIND
MARGARET WATCHED HIM WITH TEARLESS EYES
TO-DAY'S SATURDAY;--I SHALL RUN UP TO TOWN TO-MORROW OR MONDAY MORNING TO SETTLE A BIT OF BUSINESS I'VE GOT ON HAND AND COME BACK HERE IN TIME TO ATTEND THE SALE MY WIFE AND ME WAS THINKIN OF GOIN SIR THE LANDLORD ANSWERED WITH UNWONTED REVERENCE IN HIS VOICE
IT WAS A FINE THING FOR SUCH AS ME TO WIN THE LOVE OF AN HONEST MAN--A GENTLEMAN--WHO COULD SHELTER ME FROM ALL THE TROUBLES OF LIFE AND GIVE ME A STAINLESS NAME AND AN HONOURABLE PLACE IN SOCIETY
IF MY FATHER HAS BEEN GUILTY THAT MAN IS ANSWERABLE FOR HIS GUILT SHE THOUGHT PERPETUALLY
THE SERVANT WHO OPENED THE DOOR YAWNED UNDISGUISEDLY IN THE FACE OF HIS MASTER'S FRIEND
FOR ARTHUR LOVELL THE SON OF THE PRINCIPAL SOLICITOR IN THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE NEAR MAUDESLEY ABBEY ATTENDED MISS DUNBAR TO LONDON
AFTER A YEAR MISS CARPENTER AND I WERE AS FAR AS EVER--FARTHER THAN EVER PERHAPS--FROM UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER
AND THE INDEFATIGABLE WAITER WHO REFUSED TO BELIEVE IN THE EXTINCTION OF MAIL-COACHES HAD LAID THE BREAKFAST APPARATUS--FROSTY-LOOKING WHITE-AND-BLUE CUPS AND SAUCERS ON A SNOWY CLOTH A CUT-GLASS CREAM-JUG THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OUT OF ICE AND A BRAZEN URN IN THE LAST STAGE OF POLISH
AND THE BARONET FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BANKER'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER
AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
NOW IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BANKER'S INDIFFERENCE HAD ONLY BEEN ASSUMED AS A MASK BENEATH WHICH THE STRONG MAN HAD TRIED TO CONCEAL THE INTENSITY OF HIS FEELINGS
SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A STRANGELY EARNEST GAZE AS SHE CROSSED THE BOUNDARY OF HENRY DUNBAR'S DOMAIN AND THEN WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE BROAD AVENUE
THE YOUNG MAN STAMMERED OUT SOMETHING IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE BILL IN HIS HAND
THEY REACHED THE STATION AT FIVE MINUTES PAST TEN
THIS WAS HOW MARGARET REASONED
YOURS IS AN OLD CASE YOURS IS
HIM AS COME HOME FROM THE INDIES LAST AUGUST THE MAJOR GAVE A LONG LOW WHISTLE
HE HAS MOST LIKELY RETAINED ENOUGH TO PAY THE PASSAGE OUT TO AMERICA FOR HIMSELF AND MARGARET
I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE AND THE WORDS HE SAID EVERY SYLLABLE OF THOSE INSIGNIFICANT WORDS SELFISH MURMURS ABOUT THE PROBABILITY OF HIS BEING FATIGUED IN THAT LONG WALK THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HIRE A FLY AND TO HAVE DRIVEN BY THE ROAD--BAH
THE OFFICES WERE SITUATED IN A DINGY AND NARROW THOROUGHFARE LEADING OUT OF KING WILLIAM STREET AND WERE CERTAINLY NO GREAT THINGS TO LOOK AT
BUT UNHAPPILY HUMAN NATURE IS WEAK
FOR NATURE HAS ODD CAPRICES NOW AND THEN AND HAD MADE VERY LITTLE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE BANKER WHO WAS WORTH HALF A MILLION AND THE RUNAWAY CONVICT WHO WAS NOT WORTH SIXPENCE
SO LONG AS HE TOOK A SALARY FROM DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY HE WAS IN A MANNER UNDER OBLIGATION TO HENRY DUNBAR
FIND THE ANSWER FOR IT IF YOU CAN
YOU ARE GOING--MISS WILMOT YES I AM GOING
THERE WAS AN ARCHWAY AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AND A LAMP HUNG UNDER THE ARCHWAY
I GAVE MYSELF UP TO DESPAIR
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WHILE YOU WERE READING IT YOU LOOKED UP AT ME WITH A HESITATING YOU-WOULD-AND-YOU-WOULDN'T SORT OF LOOK
HE FOUND MARGARET SITTING IN THE HALL
BUT A WOMAN WHOSE RESENTMENT FOR A GREAT WRONG COULD BE DEEP AND LASTING
WE START AS SOLICITOR AND CLERK SAID MR CARTER
THE BIRD'S FLOWN HE MUTTERED
BUT THIS WAS LIKE THE REST
THESE BILLS WERE TAKEN UP AND DULY HONOURED BY THE HEADS OF THE FIRM
NO CLUE POINTING TO ANY OTHER PERSON HAD BEEN AS YET DISCOVERED THOUGH THE POLICE HAD BEEN INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR SEARCH
IT WAS A VERY HANDSOME HOUSE THOUGH IT STOOD IN A BACK SWEET
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO SHE DARED NOT TELL HIM HER DESTINATION
I'M SURE ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE MURDER HAS UPSET HER NO NO INDEED MARGARET ANSWERED I WOULD RATHER NOT TAKE ANYTHING
DO NOT TRY TO MAKE IT HARDER
THERE IS NO EXPRESS BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT HE SAID
OR REFUSE TO DO SO AND RENOUNCE ALL HOPE OF SUCCEEDING TO MY FORTUNE OR TO YOUR FATHER'S THE YOUNG MAN WAS SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES THEN HE SAID SULLENLY ENOUGH I WILL GO
WILL YOU SETTLE THE BILL MR AUSTIN
THAT IS TO SAY UPON THE NATURE OF THE STATEMENT WHICH YOU MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE MAGISTRATE SUMMONED HIS CLERK FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEN TOOK DOWN THE GIRL'S INFORMATION
IT'S WELL PLANNED--IT'S NEAT TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
HEAVEN BLESS HER INNOCENT HEART
AND HE SAT THERE ALL THE EVENING LISTENING TO AND JOINING IN THE CONVERSATION OF THE LISFORDIANS AND DRINKING SIXPENN'ORTHS OF GIN-AND-WATER WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO COULD CONSUME A HOGSHEAD OF THE JUICE OF THE JUNIPER-BERRY WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY EVIL CONSEQUENCES THEREFROM
HERE HE WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD A COUPLE OF HOURS TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN THAT WAS TO TAKE HIM ON TO NORMANTON AND AT NORMANTON HE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER HOUR TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN THAT WAS TO CARRY HIM TO HULL
THERE WAS THAT DELICIOUS FEVER OF SUSPENSE WHICH KEPT BOTH YOUNG EAGER HEARTS IN A CONSTANT GLOW
HE OR RATHER AN ACCOMPLICE EMPLOYED BY HIM HAD FORGED THE ACCEPTANCE OF A YOUNG NOBLEMAN A BROTHER OFFICER OF HENRY DUNBAR'S AND HAD CIRCULATED FORGED BILLS OF ACCOMMODATION TO THE AMOUNT OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS
BUT HE WAS LAUGHIN AND SMILIN THE NEXT MINUTE
SO FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT BY THE TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE
I CAN'T AFFORD TO TALK TO YOU THIS MORNING
BUT THAT HENRY DUNBAR THE WEALTHY HYPER-REFINED ANGLO-INDIAN SHOULD LINGER OVER THE BODY OF HIS VALET AND OFFER NEEDLESS PROFANATION TO THE DEAD WAS SOMETHING INCREDIBLE AND NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ANY THEORY WHATEVER
IT PLEASES HIM TO HANDLE THE BRUSHES THOUGH HIS HAND IS TERRIBLY SHAKY AND HE CAN SCARCELY HOLD THE PALETTE THE ARTIST LED THE WAY TO A LARGE ROOM COMFORTABLY BUT PLAINLY FURNISHED AND HEATED TO A PITCH OF SUFFOCATION BY A STOVE
WAS AWFUL SHABBY THEN
FOR THOUGH YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHY YOUR ENGAGEMENT TO HER WAS SO ABRUPTLY BROKEN OFF I COULD NOT BUT THINK SHE WAS IN SOME MANNER TO BLAME SINCE I KNEW YOU TOO WELL MY DARLING BOY TO BELIEVE YOU CAPABLE OF INCONSTANCY OR UNKINDNESS
THE CORONER LOOKED RATHER PUZZLED
I SHALL BE DETAINED TWO OR THREE DAYS AT LEAST
YOU SAY THIS PLACE IS RUGBY HE ASKED MOODILY
FOR IT LAY BETWEEN THE MEADOWS AND THE HIGH-ROAD
BUT I'M GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S ALL OFF NOW AND THAT MR ARTHUR IS TO GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH HIS FATHER
I HAD ONLY AN HOUR FOR ALL MY PREPARATIONS AND THE DRIVE TO WATERLOO
I DO NOT REMEMBER THE CORONER SCRATCHED HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY
NO MR TIBBLES HAD NOT BETRAYED HIM
AND IF YOU KNOW OF ANY SNUG LITTLE BOX IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT WOULD SUIT A LONELY OLD BACHELOR WITH A COMFORTABLE INCOME AND NOBODY TO HELP HIM SPEND IT WHY I REALLY SHOULD HAVE A VERY GREAT INCLINATION TO TAKE IT AND FURNISH IT THE LANDLORD SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND REFLECTED FOR A FEW MINUTES
I LOOKED BACK AT THE WHITE FACE RIGID IN ITS SPEECHLESS AGONY
BUT MR DUNBAR SEATED HIMSELF UPON A BENCH NEAR THE LOW DOORWAY BY WHICH HE HAD ENTERED THE CATHEDRAL AND LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
FOR SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAD SHRUNK AWAY FROM PEOPLE WRAPPED IN HER OWN SORROW SEPARATED FROM THE COMMONPLACE WORLD BY THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURE OF HER MISERY
STEP BY STEP I LURED YOU ON UNTIL YOU OFFERED TO MAKE ME YOUR WIFE
HE BUILT HIMSELF A PAINTING-ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
WE LOVED EACH OTHER SO TRULY
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS MR DUNBAR ROSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
SOMETIMES HE SPENT LESS THAN HALF
THE SIGHT OF THE WELL-KNOWN WRITING GAVE HIM A SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND HOPE AND HIS FINGERS WERE FAINTLY TREMULOUS AS THEY TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE
HE RANG A BELL ON ONE SIDE OF THE HALF-GLASS DOOR AND HAD AMPLE LEISURE TO CONTEMPLATE THE STUFFED BIRDS AND MARINE CURIOSITIES THAT ADORNED THE LITTLE HALL OF THE COTTAGE BEFORE ANY ONE CAME TO ANSWER HIS SUMMONS
I SUBMITTED VERY UNWILLINGLY
BUT SHE IS AN IMPOSTOR FOR ALL THAT
BUT HE PAUSED BEFORE THE TABLE ON WHICH THE LAMP WAS STILL STANDING
HENRY DUNBAR IS GONE AWAY FROM THE ABBEY YOU SAY
BUT THEN I AM BY NO MEANS AS RACY AS THAT WORLDLY-MINDED LITTLE GOVERNMENT CLERK
BUT THE DISCOVERY WAS SO HIDEOUS THAT I LOOKED BACK NOW AND REGRETTED THE TIME OF MY IGNORANCE AND UNCERTAINTY
WHEN HAD A MILLIONAIRE EVER BEEN KNOWN TO COMMIT A MURDER
I REMEMBER IT WELL AT WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE GEORGE AT A LITTLE AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK WHERE DID YOU GO THEN I WENT ANSWERED MR DUNBAR BOLDLY INTO THE GROVE WITH THE DECEASED ARM-IN-ARM
SO I WENT ON READING MY PAPER WHILE MY MOTHER SPECULATED ABOUT THE MATTER
HE MIGHT HELP HER
I CAN SEE THE WRETCHED CRIMINAL SHIVERING IN THE DOCK COWERING UNDER THAT BURST OF FORENSIC ELOQUENCE HENRY DUNBAR LAUGHED HEARTILY AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING AND THEN THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS EASY-CHAIR AND PASSED HIS HANDKERCHIEF ACROSS HIS HANDSOME FOREHEAD AS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO DO OCCASIONALLY
THE INQUEST WILL BE HELD TO-MORROW I SUPPOSE YES--YES TO BE SURE
TO BE IMPOSED UPON AND CHEATED BY EVERY WANDERING VAGABOND WHO FOUND HIS WAY TO HER GATES
HE GAVE ME A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF HENRY DUNBAR'S WATCH AND CHAIN
LET HIM GO WITH YOU YES MR BALDERBY EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN I BEG YOU TO ALLOW ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU
YOU'LL SEE HIM WONT YOU WHERE IS HE HERE IN THE STATION--IN THE WAITING-ROOM
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT POOR WIDOWED LADY LOUISA MET HENRY DUNBAR THE RICH BANKER
AND I MARRIED THE WOMAN I LOVED TOO
I CAME TO MEET YOU AND TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU HENRY DUNBAR LOOKED AT HIM DOUBTFULLY
CAN YOU MAKE ME AN HONEST MAN OR A RESPECTABLE MEMBER OF SOCIETY
ENTHUSIASTIC DISCIPLES OF OLD IZAAK WALTON NOW AND THEN INVADED THE HOLY QUIET OF THE PLACE
YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU MARGARET CLEMENT SAID IN A LOW EARNEST VOICE
HE TOOK HIS DINNER AND HIS SUPPER IN THAT COSY APARTMENT
YES TO BE SURE
I SHALL LEARN TO LOVE HIM PERHAPS IF I CAN SEE THE SMILING IMAGE OF HIS LOST YOUTH LAURA SAID ALL THIS IN A VERY LOW VOICE AS SHE WALKED WITH HER HUSBAND THROUGH THE GARDEN OF THE LUXEMBOURG
NOW IF YOU PLEASE WE WILL SEE THE CHAPELS MR DUNBAR EVIDENTLY DESIRED TO PUT A STOP TO THE GARRULOUS INCLINATIONS OF THE VERGER
FOR IT WILL BE AS WELL THAT HENRY DUNBAR SHOULD REMAIN IN IGNORANCE OF MY PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND THOUGH HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN THE EMPEROR OF HALF EUROPE INSTEAD OF AN ANGLO-INDIAN BANKER SIR ARDEN WOULD HAVE COMMITTED HIM FOR TRIAL HAD HE SEEN JUST CAUSE FOR SO DOING
LAURA EXCLAIMED ARTHUR LOVELL ADDRESSING HER FOR THE FIRST TIME BY HER CHRISTIAN NAME HOW COULD ANY ONE HELP LOVING YOU
ON THE CONTRARY SHE DRANK THE WINE QUITE EAGERLY AND SAID I HOPE IT WILL GIVE ME STRENGTH
MEANWHILE SHE WAITED HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS HOW ANXIOUSLY FOR HER FATHER'S COMING
YOU HAVE ONLY TO TEACH UPON MODERATE TERMS AND THE PEOPLE WILL BE GLAD TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO YOU
HOW CAN HE EVER KNOW ME BETTER WHEN HE SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDS ME
HE DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD BEEN LOITERING IN THE YARD OF THE CATHEDRAL AS THE TWO MEN PASSED ACROSS IT
I WENT TO THE CATHEDRAL-YARD AFTERWARDS AND SAW THE STRANGE MAN TALKING IN A DOORWAY WITH AN OLD MAN
DON'T ASK ME SHE PLEADED
WHEN HIS TOILET WAS COMPLETE FROM HIS TWENTY-ONE SHILLING HAT TO THE POLISHED BOOTS UPON HIS WELL-SHAPED FEET HE LEFT THE SHADY LITTLE PARLOUR IN WHICH HE HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND CAME INTO THE SHOP WITH A GLOVE DANGLING LOOSELY IN ONE UNGLOVED HAND AND A CANE IN THE OTHER
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE CATHEDRAL GENTLEMEN
THERE IS SOME MYSTERY SOME MYSTIFICATION IN ALL THIS MARGARET
WELL SIR WHEN HE CAME IN AFTER VISITING THE CATHEDRAL HIS COAT WAS PARTIALLY UNBUTTONED AND I SAW THAT HE WORE A GOLD-CHAIN AND UNLESS I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN THE SAME GOLD-CHAIN THAT I HAD SEEN PEEPING OUT OF THE BREAST OF THE MURDERED MAN
AND AS I SAID BEFORE I'M NOT GOOD AT GUESSING ENIGMAS
THERE WAS A STOPPAGE UPON LUDGATE HILL
THE VERY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS ALTERED
BUT IN THE VERY HOUR WHEN HER SOCIAL POSITION WAS MOST BRILLIANT HER BEAUTY IN THE FULL SPLENDOUR OF ITS PRIME SHE DIED SO SUDDENLY THAT THE FASHIONABLES OF CALCUTTA WERE DISCUSSING THE PROMISED SPLENDOUR OF A BALL FOR WHICH LADY LOUISA HAD ISSUED HER INVITATIONS WHEN THE TIDINGS OF HER DEATH SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE THROUGH THE CITY--HENRY DUNBAR WAS A WIDOWER
TAKE CARE STEPHEN VALLANCE HE SAID
THE NEAT LITTLE HABITATION OF THE LATE NAVAL COMMANDER LOOKED PRETTY MUCH AS MR CARTER HAD SEEN IT LAST EXCEPT THAT IN ONE OF THE UPPER WINDOWS THERE WAS A BILL--A LARGE PAPER PLACARD--ANNOUNCING THAT THIS HOUSE WAS TO LET FURNISHED
THE MAN WHO MURDERED HIM WAS I COULD HEAR NO MORE
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO POSITION OF HARDSHIP TO WHICH THE DETECTIVE WAS UNACCUSTOMED
BUT I WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED WHEN MY MOTHER ASKED IF I HAD HEARD THE LADY PLAY
DON'T ASK ME
IT WAS MOST LIKELY THAT HE WOULD BE TAKEN AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY ENTIRELY UNPREPARED IN HIS IGNORANCE OF THE FATAL DISCOVERY AT WINCHESTER
HE WAS MUCH TOO HAPPY TO TAKE OBJECTION TO ANY SUCH SMALL MATTERS
I RETURNED THEM IN TWO ENVELOPES DIRECTED TO HENRY DUNBAR AT THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH'S LANE CLEMENT AUSTIN LISTENED WITH A GRAVE FACE
YOU'VE HEARD YOUR MASTER AND THIS GENTLEMAN AT HIGH WORDS--AT LEAST YOU'VE FANCIED SO
THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED PRETTY ENOUGH POOR GIRLS HAD THE WEDDING TAKEN PLACE IN SUMMER-TIME
A CLOSE OBSERVER WOULD HAVE DETECTED THAT HIS LAUGH WAS A LITTLE FORCED HIS LOUDEST MERRIMENT WANTING IN GENIALITY
IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF OUT OF HIS ELEMENT AND UNAPPRECIATED THAT THE MAJOR WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE DIGNITY OF SILENCE AT IN SOME MYSTIC MANTLE AND RETIRED FOR THE TIME BEING FROM THE OUTER WORLD
BUT MRS MADDEN WAS NOT LAURA DUNBAR'S ONLY COMPANION UPON THIS OCCASION
THE MILLIONAIRE HAD BRIBED HER TO SILENCE
A WISE MAN DOESN'T RUN AWAY FROM LANDED ESTATES AND FINE HOUSES AND HALF A MILLION OF MONEY
IT WAS HER DEATH-WARRANT PERHAPS
THE SAD HISTORY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY THE HAND OF TIME
WELL YOU SEE CLEM SAID MY MOTHER WITH SOME LITTLE HESITATION MISS WENTWORTH IS ENGAGED ALMOST ALL THROUGH THE DAY AS HER PUPILS LIVE AT LONG DISTANCES FROM ONE ANOTHER AND SHE HAS TO WASTE A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
I'VE SHOWN THIS CATHEDRAL TO A DOOK SIR
TO THINK THAT THE FROST SHOULD HAVE LASTED VERY NEARLY THREE WEEKS AND THEN MUST NEEDS BREAK UP ON MY WEDDING MORNING
I SHALL SLEEP HERE TO-NIGHT HE SAID PRESENTLY WITHOUT TURNING TO LOOK AT THE LANDLORD WHO WAS STANDING BEHIND HIM
IN THAT HE NEVER VARIED LET HIM DO WHAT HE WOULD
PERHAPS HER FIRST REAL TROUBLE CAME TO HER NOW IN THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED HER FATHER'S RETURN TO ENGLAND
AT WHAT HOTEL ARE YOU STAYING I HAVE NOT BEEN TO ANY HOTEL YET
BUT HE HAD HOPED TO ANTICIPATE THE DREADED HOUR
I SHOULD THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR POCKET ALREADY IS A PRETTY GOOD BEGINNING MY DEAR FELLOW IT'S A STUPENDOUS BEGINNING EXCLAIMED MAJOR VERNON
HIS OFFICES IS IN SHORNCLIFFE HIGH STREET SIR
IF MISS LAURA COMES OUT IN THE PARK NOW SHE MUST WRAP HERSELF UP WARM AND WALK FAST AND NOT GO GETTING THE COLD SHIVERS FOR THE SAKE OF DRAWING A PARCEL OF STUMPS OF TREES AND SUCH-LIKE TOMFOOLERY MRS MADDEN MADE THIS OBSERVATION IN RATHER AN UNPLEASANT TONE OF VOICE ONE MORNING WHEN THE BARONET PLEADED FOR ANOTHER DRAWING-LESSON
IT'S ALTOGETHER A MISERABLE BUSINESS
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BACK PARLOUR OF THE BANKING-HOUSE
YOU MUST BUY ME AN ANNUITY
YES I AM GOING TO LINCOLN'S INN IMMEDIATELY TO MESSRS
SHE TOLD CLEMENT AUSTIN WHAT HER FATHER HAD SAID ABOUT HENRY DUNBAR
AND THE HORROR OF THE MEETING HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HER IMPRESSIONABLE NATURE AND HAD PRODUCED FOR THE TIME AT LEAST A FEARFUL EFFECT UPON HER OVER-WROUGHT BRAIN
THE DOOR WAS BANGED OPEN AND A STENTORIAN VOICE BAWLED INTO HIS EAR THAT HIDEOUS ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH IS SO FATAL TO THE REPOSE OF TRAVELLERS CHANGE HERE C C
SAVE HIM CRIED THE DETECTIVE
HI YOU THERE YOUNG WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED WITHOUT STIRRING FROM HIS POST
FOR THE PRESENT AT LEAST
JOSEPH WILMOT REMOVED HIS HAT
I IMPLORED HER TO SPEAK TO ME JUST NOW
YES AND HE GLORIED IN THE CONTINENT
HE WAS WRAPPED IN CRIMSON DRAPERIES OF THICK WOOLLEN STUFF AND THE LEOPARD-SKIN RAILWAY RUG WAS MUFFLED ABOUT HIS KNEES A DOG OF THE BULL-DOG BREED WAS LYING ASLEEP AT THE BANKER'S FEET HALF-HIDDEN IN THE FOLDS OF THE LEOPARD-SKIN
FOR A TIME AT LEAST CLEMENT AUSTIN'S MIND WAVERED
IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AFTER I LEFT MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR'S ROOM IN COMES MR HENRY DASHING AND SWAGGERING INTO THE PLACE AS IF IT WAS HIS OWN
SHE HAD IN HER OWN HAND THE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE IDENTITY BETWEEN JOSEPH WILMOT AND HER FATHER
AND THE DEAR LITTLE PEASANT-GIRLS WITH WHITE CAPS WHO ARE SO DIVINELY PRETTY WHEN YOU SEE THEM IN THE DISTANCE UNDER A SUNNY MERIDIAN SKY AND ARE SO CHARMING IN COLOURED CHALK UPON TINTED PAPER BUT SUCH MIRACLES OF UGLINESS COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING WHEN YOU BEHOLD THEM AT CLOSE QUARTERS
WHILE THESE THINGS HAD BEEN HAPPENING BETWEEN LONDON AND SOUTHAMPTON LAURA DUNBAR THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY WAITING THE COMING OF HER FATHER
I AM GOING AWAY FROM HERE BECAUSE I CAN NEVER BE YOUR WIFE YOU CAN NEVER BE MY WIFE
HIF THAT'S A SPESSERMIN OF YOUR HINJUN ACQUAINTANCES I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HINJUR OR HINJUN SERCIETY
AND THAT SIR JOCELYN WAS THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN IN HAVING DISCOVERED THIS GAY LIGHTHEARTED GIRL AMONGST THE PRUDISH AND PRAGMATICAL MEESS OF THE BRUMEUSE ANGLETERRE
THAT'LL DO WITH THIS MR CARTER DEPARTED MUCH TO THE RELIEF OF THE MONEY-LENDER
BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE ONLY BENT HIS HEAD IN ANSWER TO THE RICH MAN'S QUESTIONS
TO THINK WHAT SHE HAS SUFFERED
WHO IS THIS MARGARET WILMOT THE DAUGHTER OF THAT UNFORTUNATE MAN JOSEPH WILMOT WHO WAS CRUELLY MURDERED AT WINCHESTER ANSWERED THE CASHIER VERY GRAVELY
I KNOW THE VERY THING AS WOULD SUIT YOU MAJOR VERNON HE SAID--THE MAJOR HAD ASSUMED THE NAME OF VERNON AS AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HENRY DUNBAR--"THE VERY THING REPEATED THE LANDLORD
AND IT WAS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER HE SAYS IT'S ODD AS A GENTLEMAN THAT'S JUST COME HOME FROM INDIA SHOULD COMPLAIN OF THE HEAT ON SUCH A DAY AS YESTERDAY SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS
BUT THE POWDERED HEADS OF THE MEN AND AN INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING IN THEIR STYLE DISTINGUISHED THEM FROM THE COUNTRY-BRED COACHMEN AND HOBBLEDEHOY PAGES IN ATTENDANCE ON THE OTHER CARRIAGES
THE TWO MEN WERE INEXPRESSIBLY SHOCKED BY THIS STORY
THREE OR FOUR SADDLES AND BRIDLES HUNG UPON A RACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE SMALL STABLE
THE REST OF THE EVENING PASSED QUIETLY ENOUGH
THE CASHIER HEARD THE KEY TURNED HURRIEDLY IN THE LOCK AND HE KNEW THAT MARGARET WILMOT HAD LOCKED HERSELF IN
SHE HAD FAILED TO SEE MY ADVERTISEMENT I THOUGHT
SHE HAS FRIENDS WHO LOVE HER WELL ENOUGH TO SHIELD HER FROM THAT INDEED
THE WISEST OF US ARE LIABLE TO BE MISTAKEN ONCE IN A WAY THE CONSTABLE GRINNED AS HE TOOK THE SOVEREIGN WHICH MR CARTER OFFERED HIM
WE'D BEST TAKE SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK SIR THE YOUNG MAN SAID AS HE CAME RUNNING BACK WITH THESE THINGS
AND I DON'T MEAN TO LET IT OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL IT'S LODGED IN VERY SAFE HANDS
MR AUSTIN WAS SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES
I'VE READ-UP THE WILMOT CASE SIR MR CARTER SAID
I KNOW THAT I WALKED UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UPON THE SODDENED GRASS FROM NOON TILL SUNDOWN ALWAYS THINKING THAT I WOULD GO AWAY PRESENTLY ALWAYS LINGERING A LITTLE LONGER
UNTIL THAT TIME I CAN ONLY ENTREAT YOU TO TRUST ME AND TO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE ACTED FOR THE BEST I DO BELIEVE IT MY DEAR ANSWERED THE WIDOW CHEERFULLY
YOU CAN HOLD YOUR TONGUE I SUPPOSE
IF YOU WENT WRONG YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THROW THE BLAME OF YOUR WRONG-DOING UPON ME
SHE ONLY SAT WITH HER EYES FIXED AND HER FACE VERY PALE IN THE DIM LIGHT OF TWO CANDLES THAT FLICKERED IN THE DRAUGHT FROM THE WINDOW
BUT THOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM SAYING MORE UPON THIS OCCASION THE CASHIER BROODED LONG AND DEEPLY UPON THE CONDUCT OF HIS NIECE'S MUSIC-MISTRESS
I WON'T GO WITH YOU TO THE ABBEY
HIS INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH THE NAMES OF THE STATIONS ANNOYED HIM
THEY TALKED OF ALL MANNER OF THINGS AND IT WAS SCARCELY STRANGE THAT AMONGST OTHER TOPICS THEY SHOULD COME BY AND-BY TO THE WINCHESTER MURDER
I'M AFRAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HE SAID DRAWING IN HIS HEAD FOR A MOMENT AND LOOKING WITH A SCARED WHITE FACE AT HIS FELLOW-PASSENGERS
SHE HAD NEVER GONE CLOSE UP TO HIM AND SHE HAD RECEDED A LITTLE--INVOLUNTARILY AS A WOMAN SHRINKS AWAY FROM SOME ANIMAL SHE IS FRIGHTENED OF--WHENEVER HE HAD APPROACHED HER
WHY ELIZABETH SHE SAID YOU DON'T MEAN THAT PAPA WILL BE UNKIND TO ME I DON'T KNOW YOUR PA MISS LAURA
MR VINCENT SHOOK HIS HEAD
BUT HE HAD BEEN SEEN RIDING IN HENRY DUNBAR'S CARRIAGE AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE HAD BECOME INVESTED WITH A ROMANTIC INTEREST
HERS IS THAT IVORY PALLOR WHICH SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIES HAZEL EYES AND HAZEL-BROWN HAIR
BUT I HOPE NEVER TO SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN
I HAVE SAID THAT SHE IS PALE
BUT HE SEEMED TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE TOWN AND HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO A SMALL PUBLIC-HOUSE BY THE RIVER-SIDE ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE TOWN WALL
WE SHOULD DROP HIM A HINT THAT CONSIDERING THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH WE SHOULD TAKE IT KINDLY OF HIM IF HE WOULD HOOK IT
MARGARET'S RETURN XXXIV
THE OLD NAME WAS THE LEGITIMATE STAMP OF OUR DIGNITY AS ONE OF THE OLDEST ANGLO-INDIAN BANKING FIRMS IN THE CITY OF LONDON
AND THE WAITER OUR FRIEND OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING WAS HOVERING ABOUT EAGER TO RECEIVE US
BUT THE LEAPS THOUGH ROUGHLY CONSTRUCTED WERE RATHER FORMIDABLE
HIS NAME IS HENRY DUNBAR JAMES WENTWORTH ANSWERED AND HE IS THE SON OF A RICH BANKER
HE'S ABOUT THE VILLANOUSEST I EVER SET EYES ON ANSWERED MR TIBBLES
WHAT TIME WAS IT WHEN THE FLY STOPPED AT YOUR DOOR BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WITH WHAT A TENDER YEARNING THE GIRL HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO HENRY DUNBAR'S RETURN
THE DETECTIVE HEARD THE SOUND SLIGHT AS IT WAS AND DREW HIS INFERENCE FROM IT
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO KNOW EVERYTHING
HE KNOWS THIS
WITH A SINISTER SMILE UPON HIS LIPS AND AN OMINOUS LIGHT IN HIS EYES
THE MAJOR'S EYES WERE WIDE OPEN NOW
THIS IN A FEW WORDS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE WORTHY WOMAN SAID IN A GOOD MANY WORDS
I PUT ASIDE MY NEWSPAPER AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE OBJECT BEFORE ME
I AM ASHAMED TO BE OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT THIS YOUNG HEIRESS WAS VERY FRIVOLOUS AND LIKED READING NOVELS BETTER THAN IMPROVING HER MIND BY THE PERUSAL OF GRAVE HISTORIES OR BY THE STUDY OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES
I HAD TAKEN SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT AT THE PRINCIPAL HOTEL--A QUEER OLD-FASHIONED PLACE WITH A RUINOUS WEEDY APPEARANCE PERVADING IT AND THE IMPRESS OF INCURABLE MELANCHOLY STAMPED ON THE FACE OF EVERY SCRAP OF RICKETY FURNITURE AND LOPSIDED WINDOW-BLIND
BUT GRIEF AND LOVE ALLIED THEMSELVES PRESENTLY AND TOGETHER WERE MUCH TOO STRONG FOR INDIGNATION
I MADE NO PROFIT BY IT MYSELF AND I NEVER HOPED TO MAKE ANY
CLEMENT HURRIED TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
MR CARTER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
YES THE YOUNG MEN ANSWERED
BUT THAT'S NO MATTER
SOMEWHAT IN THIS FASHION MIGHT A MURDEROUS THUG HAVE ASSAILED HIS UNCONSCIOUS VICTIM
AND I HAVE NO WATCH NOW AND I CAN'T TELL HOW LATE IT IS
THE COURSE FORMED A LONG OVAL AND EXTENDED OVER THREE OR FOUR MEADOWS AND CROSSED A COUNTRY LANE
AND LAST OF ALL A YOUNG MAN AT HOME FROM COLLEGE YAWNING OVER A SPORTING NEWSPAPER WEARY TO DEATH OF ALL THE SIMPLE INNOCENT DELIGHTS OF HOME SICK OF THE COMPANIONSHIP OF GENTLE SISTERS THE LOVE OF A FOND MOTHER AND WISHING TO BE BACK AGAIN AT THE OLD UPROARIOUS WINE-PARTIES THE DRUNKEN ORGIES THE CARD-PLAYING AND PRIZE-FIGHTING THE EXTRAVAGANCE AND DEBAUCHERY OF THE BAD SET IN WHICH HE WAS A CHIEF
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN EMPERORS AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS ONE OF THEM
BUT THIS SETTLES EVERYTHING HE GOT UP PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AND OVER HIS EYELIDS LIKE A MAN WHO HAD JUST BEEN AWAKENED FROM A LONG SLEEP
I FEAR THERE IS SOME GREAT TROUBLE ON YOUR MIND
HE WAS OLD BUT HE LOOKED MUCH OLDER THAN HE WAS
AND THE PROPRIETOR OF THE CHAMBER SAT IN A CUSHIONED ARM-CHAIR CLOSE TO THE SUFFOCATING STOVE
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT HE REPLACED THE LETTER IN THE POCKET OF THE MEMORANDUM-BOOK AND THEN LOOKED AT THE PENCIL ENTRIES ON THE DIFFERENT PAGES
AND NOW SUPPOSE WE TAKE A STROLL THROUGH THE CATHEDRAL-YARD AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE PLACE WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND HOW SHALL WE FIND OUT THE EXACT SPOT I ASKED WHILE I WAS PUTTING ON MY HAT AND OVERCOAT
AND UPON THE SECOND MONDAY AFTER THE RAILWAY ACCIDENT HENRY DUNBAR WAS PLACED IN A COMPARTMENT WHICH WAS SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR HIM IN THE SHORNCLIFFE TRAIN AND WAS CONVEYED FROM SHORNCLIFFE STATION TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY WITHOUT UNDERGOING ANY CHANGE OF POSITION UPON THE ROAD AND VERY CAREFULLY TENDED THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY BY MR DAPHNEY AND JEFFREYS THE VALET
BUT THERE WAS NO MARGARET
DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THE NECKLACE HE SAID RATHER IMPATIENTLY
THE MAJOR HAD INSPECTED THE STARTERS FOR THE GREAT EVENT OF THE DAY AND HAD SHARPLY SCRUTINIZED THE GENTLEMAN RIDERS AS THEY WENT IN AND OUT OF THE PADDOCK
WHY SHOULD I STOP HERE TO WATCH BY AN UNCONSCIOUS MAN'S DEATH-BED
SHE MEANT TO BE THE SAME TO HER FATHER THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO HER GRANDFATHER--A LOVING COMPANION A MINISTERING ANGEL
THE LAST HEADS OF THE FIRM HAD BEEN TWO BROTHERS HUGH AND PERCIVAL DUNBAR
WELL HE CRIED EAGERLY
LET HIM CONSIDER IT A LUCKY ESCAPE HE SAID POINTING TO MR HENRY DUNBAR,--'LET HIM CONSIDER IT A LUCKY ESCAPE IF WHEN WE NEXT MEET HE GETS OFF SCOT FREE HE WAS GONE BEFORE ANY BODY COULD ANSWER HIM
NOBODY CAN DENY THAT THEY'RE GENTLEMANLY
YET THE LITTLE SITTING-ROOM HAD AN ASPECT OF SIMPLE RUSTIC PRETTINESS WHICH IS ALMOST PLEASANTER TO LOOK AT THAN FINE FURNITURE
THUS HEMMED IN BY THE TWO AND DAZZLED PERHAPS BY THE SUDDEN BRILLIANCY OF THE MOONLIGHT AFTER THE DARKNESS OF THE PLACE BELOW HE REELED BACK AGAINST AN OPENING IN THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL LOST HIS BALANCE AND FELL WITH A HEAVY PLUNGE INTO THE WATER
THE DISGRACE THAT STAINS MY NAME
IT HAS SEEMED SO HARD THAT WE WHO ARE SO RICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN PARTED AS WE HAVE BEEN WHILE POOR CHILDREN HAVE THEIR FATHERS WITH THEM
HE WAS SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED BY HIS OCCUPATION THAT HE PERHAPS HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE MISSING MAN
BUT THAT'S VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FOR YOUR DEAR FATHER LEFT ME SO COMFORTABLY OFF THAT I CAN VERY WELL AFFORD TO KEEP HOUSE FOR MY ONLY SON
I SHALL WAIT DINNER FOR HIM
HE WAS PONDERING AND REASONING UPON WHAT I TOLD HIM
THERE'S NO KNOWING HOW MUCH TROUBLE THIS CHAP MAY GIVE US
AND THERE'S BEEN A DOCTOR SENT FOR AND A DEAL OF FUSS
WHEN HE LOOKED UP LAURA DUNBAR SAW THAT HE WAS VERY PALE
WHEN HE HAD DROPPED A FEW INTO THE BELT HE STITCHED THE LEATHER ACROSS AND ACROSS QUILTING-IN THE STONES
I DARE SAY YOU WOULD CHILD
THESE THINGS ALONE COULD GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM
THE SECOND ROOM WAS EMPTY LIKE THE FIRST
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WAS
FOR HIS LIFE HAD BEEN A JOYLESS ONE A MONOTONOUS EXISTENCE OF PERPETUAL TOIL UNRELIEVED BY ANY HOME JOYS OR SOCIAL PLEASURES
HE HAD BEGUN BY PITYING HER
MASTER DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
A HORRID THING WHICH HAD NEITHER SHAPE NOR NAME AND YET WORE EVERY SHAPE AND TOOK EVERY NAME AND WAS THE GHOST OF THE DEED THAT HE HAD DONE
JAMES WAS WONT TO DESIGNATE STALWART
IN SHORT EVERYBODY FELT THAT THE ABBEY WEDDING WAS DESTINED TO BE MORE OR LESS A FAILURE
THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS FOR A MAN WHO IS ONCE FOUND OUT
FOR THE THIRD TIME MARGARET WILMOT WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE HOPE OF SEEING HENRY DUNBAR
THE DOCTOR GAVE A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE START AS HE HEARD THAT NAME OF WILMOT
BUT HE NEVER TOOK LEAVE OF A LIVING CREATURE AND I FULLY BELIEVE THAT HE NEVER IN HIS HEART FORGAVE EITHER HIS FATHER OR HIS UNCLE
YOU WON'T APPEAR TO TAKE ANY INTEREST IN THE TALK ABOUT HENRY DUNBAR AND THE MURDER OF HIS VALET
BUT THAT PERSON WAS CLEMENT AUSTIN WHO HAD ALREADY GROWN SKILLED IN READING THE VARYING EXPRESSIONS OF HER FACE AND WHO SAW NOW THAT SHE WAS CHANGED
THERE WAS A CONFIDENT AIR ABOUT THE MAJOR WHICH SEEMED LIKE THAT OF A MAN WITH A BALANCE AT HIS BANKER'S
UNDER A LABURNUM-TREE THERE WAS A GREEN RUSTIC BENCH
FOR NEITHER THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE NOR MAUDESLEY ABBEY HAD BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
WHEREAS MR DUNBAR SEEMED PLUNGED INTO THE UTTERMOST DEPTHS OF DESPAIR BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE WORTHY MAJOR EXHIBITED A DELIGHT THAT WAS ALMOST UPROARIOUS IN ITS MANIFESTATION
AND BEING SOMETHING OF A DAY-DREAMER I LIKED THE PLACE BECAUSE OF ITS STILLNESS AND SOLITUDE
BUT HE HAD A KIND OF LANGUID DON'T-CAREISH WAY THAT SEEMS TO BE PECULIAR TO FIRST-CLASS GENTLEMEN WHAT SORT OF A LOOKING MAN WAS HE PALER THAN MR DUNBAR AND THINNER BUILT AND FAIRER I JOTTED DOWN THE WAITER'S REMARKS
AND HENRY DUNBAR'S BEAUTIFUL WIFE BECAME QUEEN OF THE BEST SOCIETY IN THE CITY OF PALACES BY THE RIGHT OF HER OWN RANK AND HER HUSBAND'S WEALTH
BUT EVEN THEN I DISMISSED IT AS INCREDIBLE
YOU ARE CRUEL AND UNJUST MR AUSTIN MARGARET SAID
THE BUYING AND MAKING OF THE NEW FROCKS AND MUSLIN FURBELOWS SEEMED ALMOST TO ABSORB MY MOTHER'S MIND AND SHE WAS FAIN TO DELEGATE TO ME THE DUTY OF FINDING A MUSICAL GOVERNESS FOR MISS LESTER
BECAUSE YOU SEE A CHAP THAT CAN PLAY THE BOLD GAME HE HAS PLAYED AND KEEP IT UP FOR NIGH UPON A TWELVEMONTH COULD PLAY ANY GAME
HAVE MERCY UPON HIM AND GIVE HIM A PENITENT HEART AND WASH AWAY HIS SIN
CALL ME ANYTHING THAT BEGINS WITH A V
MR DUNBAR ARE HUP HE SAID
I HAVE READ IN A HISTORY OF WARWICKSHIRE THAT WHEN ALGERNON JOCELYN WAS MARRIED TO DAME MARGERY MILWARD WIDOW TO SIR STEPHEN MILWARD KNIGHT IN CHARLES THE FIRST'S TIME THERE WAS A CLOTH-OF-GOLD CANOPY FROM THE GATE YONDER TO THIS PORCH HERE AND TWO MOVING TURRETS OF BASKET-WORK EACH OF EM DRAWN BY FOUR HORSES AND FILLED WITH FORTY POOR CHILDREN CROWNED WITH ROSES LOOKIN OUT OF THE TURRET WINDERS AND SCATTERIN SCENTED WATERS ON THE CROWD
BUT HE KEPT TRYING FIRST ONE KEY AND THEN ANOTHER FOR EVER SO LONG BEFORE HE COULD FIND THE RIGHT ONE DID HE NOW
CLEMENT RETURNED TO THE OFFICE WHERE HE HAD LEFT MARGARET IN ORDER TO REPEAT TO HER MR DUNBAR'S MESSAGE
HE LOOKED SUPERCILIOUSLY ENOUGH AT JOSEPH WILMOT EYEING HIM LAZILY FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND YAWNING AS HE DID SO
THE BRAND OF SOCIETY WAS UPON ME
SIR PHILIP JOCELYN SPOKE OF THE UNIVERSE AS A YOUNG HUSBAND TALKS OF HIS WIFE
THERE ARE DIAMONDS THAT ARE KNOWN ALL OVER EUROPE
NO I'LL TAKE THEM STRAIGHT TO MY HOTEL
YOU'RE IMPROVING MR AUSTIN HE SAID
AND PRESENTLY I SAW A PARASOL RATHER A SHABBY ONE AND THEN A SLENDER FIGURE COMING QUICKLY TOWARDS OUR GATE AND THEN THE FACE WHICH I AM WEAK ENOUGH TO THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE IN CHRISTENDOM
YOU CAN GIVE ME NONE OF THESE MR HENRY DUNBAR WAS ESSENTIALLY A MAN OF THE WORLD
YOU WILL SEE THEN HOW MY FATHER HAD BEEN WRONGED BY HENRY DUNBAR ARTHUR LOVELL UNFOLDED THE WORN AND FADED LETTER
MARGARET'S JOURNEY XV
UNLESS YOU'RE ANY RELATION OF THE MURDERED MAN
FAR AWAY UPON THE HORIZON THERE WAS A FAINT SPECK OF SHIMMERING WHITE TO WHICH ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN POINTED WITH HIS BRAWNY FINGER IT WAS THE DIRTY MAINSAIL OF THE CROW BLEACHED INTO SILVER WHITENESS UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
THIS WAS ALL MR CARTER WANTED TO KNOW
I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
ONLY FOR ONE MOMENT HAD SHE PEEPED WONDERINGLY INTO THE SPLENDID INTERIOR OF HENRY DUNBAR'S MANSION
DO WHAT I WOULD I COULD NOT DETAIN HER
FOR HE WAS PRESENT AT THE INQUEST AND ALL FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES AT WINCHESTER IF MARGARET WILMOT AND CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD BEEN GOING UPON ANY OTHER ERRAND THAN THAT WHICH TOOK THEM TO WARWICKSHIRE THE JOURNEY TO SHORNCLIFFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASANT TO THEM
DON'T BE ALARMED HE SAID SMILING AT THE MAN'S SCARED FACE
WELL AUSTIN SAID MR BALDERBY TURNING TO THE CASHIER WE MAY PREPARE OURSELVES TO MEET OUR NEW CHIEF VERY SPEEDILY
THERE'S A BIT OF BLUE PEEPIN THROUGH THE CLOUDS
WELL THE ARTIST ANSWERED DOUBTFULLY I SHOULD BE INCLINED TO FEAR THAT THE PORTRAIT MAY HAVE BEEN PAINTED OUT
I HAVE BEEN THINKING IT ALL OVER SINCE AND I CANNOT HELP FANCYING THAT THE CHANGE IN YOUR MANNER DATED FROM THE EVENING ON WHICH MY MOTHER TOLD YOU THAT DREADFUL STORY
CLEMENT LOST NO TIME OVER HIS TOILET
WERE YOU EXAMINED AT THE INQUEST ON JOSEPH WILMOT NO SIR ANSWERED THE WAITER EAGERLY
AH BETTY YOU'VE GOT THE TOOTHACHE AGAIN HAVE YOU
THAT'S A TALLOW-DROP SIR HE SAID
PHILIP JOCELYN'S WORK THAT MORNING WAS BY NO MEANS LIGHT FOR LAURA WAS FOND OF PICTURES IN A FRIVOLOUS AMATEURISH KIND OF WAY
THE MAN CAME QUICKLY IN ANSWER TO THAT IMPATIENT SUMMONS
A LETTER WHICH HAD COME BY THE EVENING POST
MY POOR GIRL I CAN SEE THAT THIS INTERVIEW HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
HIS DEATH MAKES NO BLANK IN THE WORLD
THE NAME OF STEPHEN BALDERBY WAS WRITTEN ON THE LEFT-HAND LOWER CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE
THE PUBLIC GRUMBLED A LITTLE WHEN THERE WAS NO NEW PARAGRAPH IN THE PAPERS ABOUT THAT DREADFUL WINCHESTER MURDER BUT THE NINE-DAYS PERIOD DURING WHICH THE ENGLISH PUBLIC CARES TO WONDER ELAPSED AND NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE
UPON ALL THE LENGTH OF THE PLATFORM THERE WAS NO SIGN OF MR TIBBLES OTHERWISE SAWNEY TOM
AH HOW BLESSED IS THAT DIVINE AND ILLIMITABLE COMPASSION WHICH CAN FIND PITY FOR THOSE WHOM SINFUL MAN REJECTS
HOWEVER I WILL SEND HER A SEDATIVE DRAUGHT WHICH HAD BETTER BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AND I'LL LOOK ROUND IN THE MORNING MR VINCENT LEFT THE REINDEER AND CLEMENT WENT TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM
I AM JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER THE WOMAN SAID
YES THAT GENTLEMAN AS YOU CALL HIM IS OR RATHER WAS MY CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT
YOU'D BETTER NOT MEAN IT
HE WENT IN AND SELECTED A COUPLE OF CHAMOIS SKINS VERY THICK AND STRONG
BUT MY FATHER REFUSED TO ALLOW THIS
THE CAPS AND JACKETS OF THE GENTLEMAN RIDERS MADE SPOTS OF COLOUR AGAINST THAT UNIFORM GREY SKY
I STOOD ON HIS LEFT HAND WATCHING HIM INTENTLY
QUIESCENCE HAD BECOME INTOLERABLE TO HIM
AND THEN LOOKED SIGNIFICANTLY AT DORA MACMAHON
THE ANGLO-INDIAN CRUSHED THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKET AND LOOKED UP LANGUIDLY
THE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG CREPT UP TO MR DUNBAR WITH HIS HEAD DOWN
CHAPTER XLV
SHE WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN I TELL HER THE HISTORY OF MY JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER
IT BORE UPON IT THE STAMP OF ALMOST LIMITLESS WEALTH
YOU CAN LET HER HAVE ANY MONEY YOU THINK PROPER
AND WE CAN TALK THIS MATTER OVER SERIOUSLY
YOU CAN SEE TO YOUR WORK HERE IN THE MORNING AND REACH YOUR DESTINATION BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
BUT PRESENTLY WHILE THE VERGER WAS BUSY UNLOCKING THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE CHAPELS MR DUNBAR SUDDENLY REELED LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN AND THEN DROPPED HEAVILY UPON AN OAKEN BENCH NEAR THE CHAPEL-DOOR
THAT'S THE QUESTION THE OWNER OF THE SHOP APPEARED AND LOOKED SHARPLY AT HIS CUSTOMER
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STRIKES ME VERY PARTICULAR IN ALL YOU'VE TOLD ME THE DETECTIVE SAID BY-AND-BY WHEN I HAD GROWN TIRED OF WATCHING HIM AND HAD SUFFERED MY THOUGHTS TO WANDER BACK TO THE HAPPY TIME IN WHICH MARGARET AND I HAD LOVED AND TRUSTED EACH OTHER
BUT HE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO ENJOY ANY PROLONGED REST
BUT THEY KNEW ALSO THAT THE SIGNATURE OF THE DRAWER HENRY DUNBAR WAS GENUINE
I MAY PICK UP SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP ME TO FIND YOUR FATHER
I AM A MAN MISS WILMOT CLEMENT ANSWERED BITTERLY
THIS TIME THE EMOTION WAS STRONGER THAN HIS WILL AND ALTOGETHER OVERCAME HIM
AND WE LIVED AMONGST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
IT WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED SHEET OF BATH POST STAMPED WITH THE NAME OF THE STATIONER WHO HAD SOLD IT--JAKINS KYLMINGTON
IT WAS THE DRESS OF A MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN
BUT WHEN I GETS OUT ON TO THE QUAY-SIDE THERE AIN'T A VESTIGE OF HIM
YES HIS UNCLE ANSWERED
HAD IT COME NOW
FOR THE BANKER REFUSED TO DISTURB HIS DAUGHTER BY PRESENTING HIMSELF AT THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE AFTER MIDNIGHT
AND COME BACK TO ME TO-MORROW MORNING AND TELL ME TO THROW THIS STUPID LETTER IN THE FIRE--THAT'S THE WISEST THING YOU CAN DO
I WILL HAVE NO FARTHER HAND IN THIS MATTER
BUT IN SPITE OF HIS HOST'S GAIETY ARTHUR LOVELL WAS ILL AT EASE
THE MAJOR'S FOLDED ARMS DROPPED OFF THE LEDGE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SUDDENLY PARALYZED
YOU UNDERSTAND NOW WHY IT WAS SO DIFFICULT FOR MARGARET WILMOT TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE MAN AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF UPON THIS POINT JOSEPH WILMOT WENT BACK TO THE OUTFITTER'S TO CHOOSE HIS NEW CLOTHES
AND HERE IN THIS CROWDED TERMINUS THERE WAS LIFE AND BUSTLE AND VARIETY ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE
AND I SHALL HAVE YOU MORE AT HOME DEAR AND THAT WILL INDEED BE HAPPINESS BUT CLEMENT TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT HE HAD SOME VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON HAND JUST THEN WHICH WOULD OCCUPY HIM A GOOD DEAL
THE SURGEON WHO EXAMINED THE SUFFERERS SAID THAT MR DUNBAR MIGHT RECOVER FROM HIS INJURIES IN TWO OR THREE MONTHS IF HE WAS CAREFULLY TREATED
ANYHOW I'M AFTER HIM AND IT'LL GO HARD WITH ME IF HE GIVES ME THE SLIP AFTER ALL FOR MY BLOOD'S UP AND MY CHARACTER'S AT STAKE AND I'D THINK NO MORE OF CROSSING THE ATLANTIC AFTER HIM THAN I'D THINK OF GOING OVER WATERLOO BRIDGE IT WAS A VERY CHILL AND MISERABLE TIME OF THE MORNING WHEN THE PRETTY POLLY GROUND HER NOSE AGAINST THE GRANITE STEPS OF THE QUAY
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STRIKES ME IN ALL THE YOUNG LADY SAID TO YOU AND THAT IS THESE WORDS--'THERE IS CONTAMINATION IN MY TOUCH MISS WILMOT SAYS TO YOU
HOW CAN YOUR FATHER DO OTHERWISE THAN LOVE YOU WHEN HE GROWS TO KNOW YOU WELL
MY OLD FRIEND MICHAEL MARSTON DID NOT MARRY UNTIL AFTER I LEFT ENGLAND
AS HE HAD BROODED AT THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE PARLOUR OF THE BASINGSTOKE INN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH HIS BROTHER SAMPSON
THE TWO MEN WERE OUT OF HEARING OR DID NOT CARE TO REPLY TO HIM
BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED IN IT AS A PRINCIPAL YOU KNOW DEAR MOTHER
AND THEY DO SAY AS WE OUGHT EVERY ONE OF US TO HAVE BEEN EXAMINED
HIS HEALTH WAS FEEBLE AND THE SHOCK OF MEETING WITH HIS BROTHER--THIS POOR LOST DISGRACED BROTHER--WHOM HE HAD FOR FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS BELIEVED TO BE DEAD HAD BEEN ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR HIM
POOR GIRL HE SAID TO HIMSELF PRESENTLY
I'M NOT MUCH OF A CHURCH-GOER BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A PROVIDENCE THAT LIES IN WAIT FOR WICKED MEN AND CATCHES THE VERY CLEVEREST OF THEM WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT I HAD NEVER SEEN MR CARTER SO MUCH EXCITED AS HE SEEMED NOW
BUT WHEN YOU BROKE THAT CLARET-GLASS AFTER DINNER IT STRUCK ME SOMEHOW THAT YOU WERE--SHALL I VENTURE THE WORD?--_RATHER NERVOUS
MAJOR MELVILLE'S DAUGHTERS LOOKED VERY PALE AND COLD IN THEIR WHITE-AND-BLUE DRESSES AND THE NORTH-EASTER HAD TWEAKED THEIR NOSES WHICH WERE RATHER SHARP AND POINTED IN STYLE
I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKELY MR DUNBAR WILL SEE YOU MISS HE SAID
SO FAR SO GOOD
BUT SHE HAD FREELY GIVEN THEM UP WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE HAD SET HIS HEART UPON WINNING MARGARET WILMOT FOR HIS WIFE
HIS ATTEMPT TO BRIBE HER--THESE WERE STRONG POINTS
YOU MUST SUBMIT CLEMENT
TWO FAIR-FACED GIRLS
SHE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE SAILED TILL DAYBREAK NEXT MORNING AND THERE WASN'T ABOVE TWO-THIRDS OF HER CARGO ABOARD HER YET
AND I WANT YOU TO BE PLEASED WITH MY VICTORY
I WANT TO GET TO LONDON HE SAID
BUT I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IMPLORED A STATUE
MRS AUSTIN CONFESSED THAT SHE WOULD RATHER HER SON HAD CHOSEN SOME DAMSEL WHO COULD LAY CLAIM TO GREATER WORLDLY ADVANTAGES THAN THOSE POSSESSED BY THE YOUNG MUSIC-MISTRESS
HE GAVE ONE GREAT DINNER-PARTY SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT MAUDESLEY A BALL AT WHICH LAURA FLOATED ABOUT IN A CLOUD OF WHITE GAUZE AND WITH DIAMONDS IN HER HAIR
THE IDEA THAT SHE HAD BEEN BRIBED FLASHED ACROSS ME IN THE FIRST BITTERNESS OF MY ANGER
I SHALL WAIT FOR YOU HOWEVER LONG YOU MAY BE
THE BLINDS WERE UNDRAWN AND HE COULD SEE THE BARE WALLS OF THE ROOMS THE FIRELESS GRATES AND THAT COLD BLEAKNESS OF ASPECT PECULIAR TO AN UNTENANTED HABITATION
THE BANKER HAD GIVEN HIS SHABBY ACQUAINTANCE A HANDFUL OF SOVEREIGNS FOR PRESENT USE AS WELL AS THE CHEQUES
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RENOUNCE THE POMPS AND VANITIES OF THIS WICKED WORLD AND MAKE AN EARLY EXPEDITION ACROSS THE HERRING-POND--EH FRIEND OF MY SOUL WHY SHOULD I RUN AWAY ASKED HENRY DUNBAR STERNLY
AND THE BAD WINES AND THE DUST AND THE CATHEDRALS AND THE BEGGARS AND THE TRENTE-ET-QUARANTE TABLES AND IN SHORT EVERYTHING
YOU DO ME WRONG SIR WHEN YOU THINK THAT I COULD WILLINGLY LEAVE YOU FOR MY OWN ADVANTAGE CLEMENT ANSWERED QUIETLY
DUNBAR AND DUNBAR WOULD NOT CARE TO SEE THE HEIR OF THEIR HOUSE IN A CRIMINAL DOCK
AND MR TIBBLES EQUANIMITY WAS RESTORED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HAM EGGS MUTTON-CUTLET A BROILED SOLE AND A QUART OR SO OF BOILING COFFEE
HE SAT THUS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE LANDLORD CAME TO HIM
NO NO THAT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
THAT WAS THE VERY AFTERNOON UPON WHICH JAMES WENTWORTH HAD LEFT HIS DAUGHTER TO GO TO LONDON BY RAIL
I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT MY LADY AT PRESENT THE DETECTIVE ANSWERED
ANGRY WITH YOU MY SWEET ONE AND YOU WILL STILL LOVE ME YES LAURA WITH ALL A BROTHER'S DEVOTION
I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS HOUSE WHO HAS EVER SEEN OUR PRESENT CHIEF HENRY DUNBAR I AM SIR SO FAR SO GOOD
THIS WAS HER OPPORTUNITY
OH YOU DEAR COMMERCIAL CLEM ALWAYS THINKING OF TERMS CRIED MY MOTHER
FOR THE WAITER HAD BEEN WARMED INTO A COMMUNICATIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL MOOD AND WAS NOW READY TO TELL US ANYTHING HE KNEW
THE SUBTLE AROMA VANISHED UNDER THAT DISMAL INFLUENCE
YOU TOLD ME TO HANG ABOUT THE STATION AND WATCH THE TRAINS AND YOU'D COME BACK IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY--YOU WOULD--AND WE'D DINE TOGETHER COMFORTABLE AT THE STATION HOTEL
SOMETIMES A BROAD-LEAVED HAT OF YELLOW STRAW WITH FLOATING RIBBON AND A BUNCH OF FEATHERY GRASSES PERCHED BEWITCHINGLY UPON THE BRIM
YOU MAY HAVE WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL A NECKLACE FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS OR YOU MAY HAVE ONE THAT'LL COST YOU TWENTY THOUSAND
I'LL TAKE IT AT YOUR VALUATION IF THE PRESENT OWNERS ARE AGREEABLE TO SELL IT ON THOSE TERMS AND I'LL PAY A DEPOSIT OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OR SO ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO SHOW THAT MY PROPOSITION IS A BONA FIDE ONE A LITTLE MORE WAS SAID AND THEN MR GROGSON PLEDGED HIMSELF TO ACT FOR THE BEST IN THE INTERESTS OF MAJOR VERNON CONSISTENTLY WITH HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE PRESENT OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY
WHY WAS THIS FATHER FRIGHTENED OF HIS OWN DAUGHTER UNLESS
I KNOW WHERE YOU COULD SEE MISS WILSON NEARER THAN THE HERMITAGE SHE SAID AND SOONER THAN TO-MORROW MORNING
HE WAS IN NO VERY GREAT HURRY TO DECLARE HIMSELF
WHY HE MUST BE GOING NORTH
CHAPTER XI
I NEVER QUARRELLED WITH HIM THERE HAD BEEN NO CAUSE OF QUARREL BETWEEN YOU I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION
BUT I'M AN OLD MAN
BUT I WHO HAD SEEN HER NATURE PROVED IN THE FIERY FURNACE OF AFFLICTION KNEW WHAT A PRICELESS PEARL HEAVEN HAD GIVEN ME IN THIS WOMAN WHOSE NAME MUST HENCEFORWARD SOUND VILE IN THE EARS OF HONEST MEN AND I DID NOT RECOIL FROM THE HORROR OF MY POOR GIRL'S HISTORY
MRS AUSTIN VERY SPEEDILY DISCOVERED HER SON'S SECRET
AT THE TOP THERE WAS A LAYER OF JEWELLERS WOOL AND ON THAT BEING REMOVED MY MOTHER GAVE A LITTLE SHRIEK OF SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
THE BANKER RETURNED TO THE GEORGE
AND THEN
THE MAN WALKING UP AND DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE SLAPPING HIS GLOVED HANDS ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS EVERY NOW AND THEN TO KEEP HIMSELF WARM
OH DO OPEN--DO PLEASE OPEN IT DIRECTLY
I HAVE A DAUGHTER A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS YOUR DAUGHTER
THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE SLEPT WAS INSIDE THAT OCCUPIED BY MRS AUSTIN
MR DUNBAR LEFT HIS CAB AT THE HOLBORN END OF THE STREET AND WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE PAVEMENT TILL HE CAME TO A VERY DINGY-LOOKING PARLOUR-WINDOW WHICH MIGHT HAVE BELONGED TO A LAWYER'S OFFICE BUT FOR SOME GILDED LETTERS ON THE WIRE BLIND WHICH IN A VERY PALE AND FADED INSCRIPTION GAVE NOTICE THAT THE PARLOUR BELONGED TO MR ISAAC HARTGOLD DIAMOND-MERCHANT
THE CLERKS USE IT SOMETIMES WHEN THEY GO IN AND OUT THEN I SHALL GO OUT THAT WAY SAID MR DUNBAR WHO WAS ALMOST BREATHLESS IN HIS HASTE
AND THE GROOM AS HAD CHARGE OF MR DUNBAR'S HORSE AND SLEP AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE NOT FAR FROM THE STABLES FANCIED AS HOW HE HEARD A TRAMPLING LAST NIGHT WHERE THE HORSE WAS KEP BUT PUT IT DOWN TO THE ANIMAL BEIN RESTLESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT YET FIVE O'CLOCK THE WINTRY LIGHT WAS FADING IN THE GREY SKY AND IN THE RAILWAY STATION IT WAS ALREADY DARK
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TELEGRAPH TO MY DAUGHTER MR LOVELL HE ADDED TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN
LAURA DUNBAR MIGHT PASS HER FATHER IN THE STREET WITHOUT RECOGNIZING HIM AND YET HER AFFECTION FOR HIM HAS BEEN UNCHANGED IN ALL THESE YEARS MR BALDERBY GAVE THE OLD CLERK A POCKET-BOOK CONTAINING SIX FIVE-POUND NOTES
EVERYTHING IS FINISHED IS IT NOT
FULL OF THESE AMBITIOUS HOPES ELIZABETH MADDEN HAD PLAYED HER PART OF DUENNA WITH SUCH DISCRETION AS TO GIVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR SWEET HALF-WHISPERED CONVERSE FOR MURMURED CONFIDENCES SOFT AND LOW AS THE COOING OF TURTLE-DOVES
AND YET HE LOOKED A STRONG MAN
I AM SPEAKING NOW OF THE SIMPLE COUNTRY PEOPLE FOR WHOM A RACE MEANT A DAY'S PLEASURE
WILL THE CELEBRATED NEW ZEALANDER THAT IS TO BE DISCOVER THE VOLUMES AMIDST THE RUINS OF CLAPHAM
THE FIRM OF DUNBAR HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED VERY SOON AFTER THE ENGLISH FIRST GREW POWERFUL IN INDIA
SAY GOD BLESS YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE I GO HER HEAD WAS ON HIS BREAST AND HER FACE LIFTED UP TOWARDS HIS OWN AS SHE SAID THIS
I AM NOT TOO PROUD TO ACCEPT YOUR HELP IN THE HOUR OF MY NEED YOU WILL WRITE TO ME THEN AT MY MOTHER'S OR YOU WILL WRITE TO MY MOTHER HERSELF IF EVER YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE
THIS WAS THE FATHER TO WHOSE COMING LAURA DUNBAR LOOKED FORWARD WITH EAGER ANXIETY WITH A HEART OVERFLOWING WITH TENDER WOMANLY LOVE
WAS ODD IN HIS WAYS AND DRESSED QUEER
AND THE NAMES OF DUNBAR AND DUNBAR PAINTED UPON THE DOOR-POSTS AND ENGRAVED UPON SHINING BRASS PLATES ON THE MAHOGANY DOORS HAD NEVER BEEN EXPUNGED OR ALTERED
HENRY DUNBAR GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
IF YOU'LL ORDER A CARRIAGE AND PAIR TO BE GOT READY IMMEDIATELY WE'LL DRIVE OVER TO WINCHESTER
HE HAD ENTERED THE SHOP AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT MORNING A BLACKGUARD AS WELL AS A VAGABOND
FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS HE SAT IN THE SAME ATTITUDE EXAMINING THE PAPERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND RE-SORTING THEM
YOU SEEM A VERY AGREEABLE FELLOW AND WILL NO DOUBT BE QUITE AS USEFUL AS THE ORIGINAL PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN
A GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH PARALYSIS AND WAS DYING
I WERE NOT SIR
REALLY THIS IS TOO BAD CRIED THE BANKER AS THE CLOCK CHIMED THE THREE-QUARTERS
BUT I WAS NEVERTHELESS MOST HEARTILY THANKFUL THAT PROVIDENCE HAD SUFFERED HIM TO ESCAPE THAT HIDEOUS EARTHLY DOOM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WISEST MEANS OF RIDDING SOCIETY OF A WRETCH
WHAT A WRETCHED MORNING SHE SAID
COME MR JOSEPH WILMOT HE SAID
AT HALF-PAST THREE THERE WAS A LONDON TRAIN TO START FROM THE STATION ON THE LINCOLNSHIRE SIDE OF THE WATER
IT WAS PAST SIX O'CLOCK WHEN THE CORONER'S INQUEST WAS CONCLUDED AND THE THREE MEN SAT DOWN TO DINNER TOGETHER AT SEVEN
THAT IS IF YOU WANT ME TO SUCCEED IN THE BUSINESS I'M ENGAGED UPON
AND ONLY ANSWER ME ONE QUESTION
BUT THEY HAD NOT THAT SPLENDID EXCEPTIONAL BEAUTY WHICH CAN DEFY ALL CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE AND WHICH IS ALIKE GLORIOUS WHETHER CLAD IN ABJECT RAGS OR ROBED IN VELVET AND ERMINE
WHO'LL CATCH THE CROW YONDER FOR A FIVER COME
WE'VE NO TIME TO WASTE ON SNIVELLING CHAPTER XLI
IF HE HASN'T LEFT THE COUNTRY AND IF HE DOESN'T MEAN TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR HIM AND SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO CATCH HIM
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE SOME IDEA THAT YOU'D LIKE TO CARRY OUT
SHE LOOKED VERY HAPPY IN SPITE OF THE BAD WEATHER AND MISS DUNBAR SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE COMFORTED BY HER HALF-SISTER
CLEMENT AUSTIN APPEARED FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS CARRYING TWO PONDEROUS MOROCCO-BOUND VOLUMES
EXCEPT TO ME--EXCEPT TO ME CLEMENT AUSTIN DID NOT FORGET HIS PROMISE TO DO HIS UTTERMOST TOWARDS THE DISCOVERY OF THE BANKER'S GUILT
BUT I AM A MAN AND I HAVE A MAN'S AMBITION--A STRONG MAN'S IRON WILL
THE SHADOW UPON MARGARET'S LIFE NOW WAS THE SHADOW OF THAT COMING TASK--THAT HORRIBLE WORK WHICH MUST BE DONE--BEFORE SHE COULD BE FREE TO THANK GOD FOR HIS MERCIES AND TO BE HAPPY
TEN MILES
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS FORGOTTEN
HALF-A-DOZEN LAME MEN WITH HALF-A-DOZEN YOUNG WOMEN FOR THEIR COMPANIONS MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED IN THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF THE ARRIVAL PLATFORM
THAT WAS A STRANGE AFFAIR BY THE BYE SAID MR CARTER
IT IS THE SIGHT OF SORROWS WHICH WE CANNOT ALLEVIATE THAT SENDS A PALPABLE STAB HOME TO OUR HEARTS AND FOR A TIME ALMOST SICKENS US WITH A UNIVERSE WHICH CANNOT GO UPON ITS COURSE WITHOUT SUCH MISERIES AS THESE
AND YET YOU THROW AWAY SUCH A CHANCE AS ONLY FALLS TO THE LOT OF ONE MAN IN A THOUSAND
HE HEARD NOTHING
HE BADE MRS AUSTIN GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT HER
MY EYES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE HE SAID WITH A GOOD-TEMPERED LAUGH WHEN HE WENT BACK TO ARTHUR LOVELL
AFTER FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS
YOU MIGHT MEET THAT IF YOU LEFT SHORNCLIFFE BY THE 4:35 TRAIN I COULD DO THAT ANSWERED THE BANKER
WILL THAT DO IT WILL DEAR BOY
BUT FOUND THAT SHE WAS OUT SHOPPING WITH MRS MADDEN
THE PROUDEST BEAUTY IN CALCUTTA WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BECOME THE WIFE OF THE SOLE HEIR OF THAT DINGY BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
I SHAN'T TREAT YOU ALTOGETHER AS A SERVANT YOU KNOW JOSEPH HE SAID BUT I SHALL MAKE QUITE A COMPANION OF YOU AND YOU'LL GO ABOUT WITH ME WHEREVER I GO
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO THE FERNS A MATTER OF TWO MILE SIR MR DUNBAR LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT CLEMENT HAD EVER CALLED UPON HER ALONE
LOVELL WROTE ME A LETTER TO THAT EFFECT
AND BELIEVE ME I AM HEARTILY SORRY FOR THE PAST
I HOPE AND I VENTURE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE AS INNOCENT AS I AM MYSELF OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME MR DUNBAR THE BARONET SAID KINDLY
MY FATHER NEVER MET ANY GOOD CHRISTIAN WHO WAS WILLING TO RUN THAT RISK IN THE HOPE OF SAVING A HUMAN SOUL
TO-NIGHT HE RETIRED VERY EARLY DISMISSED THE SERVANT WHO ATTENDED UPON HIM AND LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE OUTER ROOM THE ONLY DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH THE CORRIDOR OF THE HOTEL
MAUDESLEY ABBEY WAS A LARGE AND RAMBLING OLD MANSION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT IN HALF-A-DOZEN DIFFERENT REIGNS
THE TICKET-COLLECTOR RUNNING FROM CARRIAGE TO CARRIAGE WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO DISCOVER THAT THE LITTLE BIT OF PASTEBOARD WHICH JOSEPH WILMOT EXHIBITED WAS ONLY A RETURN-TICKET TO WANDSWORTH
I AM QUITE CONTENT TO BE A SLEEPING-PARTNER IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
I SHALL BE VERY GLAD
THE TRAIN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO TOWN WAS A LONG TRAIN COMING THROUGH FROM THE NORTH
BUT I DOUBT IF IT IS NOT AFTER ALL THE BASER FORM OF THE GREAT PASSION
LAURA WAS LOST TO HIM FOR EVER
AND THEY COMPARED HIM VERY DISADVANTAGEOUSLY WITH HIS PREDECESSOR PERCIVAL DUNBAR
THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH HE PERPETUALLY ASKED HIMSELF
IT WAS A GREAT NAME IN THE CITY--IT WAS A WELL-KNOWN NAME--DUN--DUNBAR--DUNBAR WHY FATHER THAT WAS THE VERY NAME I WAS ASKING YOU ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO I DON'T REMEMBER YOUR ASKING ME ANY SUCH THING THE OLD MAN ANSWERED RATHER SNAPPISHLY
NOW STOPPING BY LAURA'S CHAIR AND URGING HER TO TAKE THIS THAT OR THE OTHER
IN THAT CASE I FULLY DESERVE TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOWEVER BITTER THE DISAPPOINTMENT MAY BE
HE WENT THROUGH THIS OPERATION WITH THE CONTENTS OF ALL THE BOXES THROWING THE CLOTHES UPON THE FLOOR AND CARRYING THE PAPERS TO THE WRITING-TABLE WHERE HE PILED THEM UP IN A GREAT MASS
CALM AND GENTLE IN HER OUTWARD DEMEANOUR SHE KEPT HER SECRET BURIED IN HER BREAST AND ASKED FOR NO SYMPATHY
UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS LAWN SHE SAW THE DARK FRONTAGE OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND THREE TALL LIGHTED WINDOWS GLEAMING THROUGH THE NIGHT
YES MR BALDERBY SIR
I CARE VERY LITTLE WHERE I GO IN MY SEARCH FOR THE MAN WHO MURDERED MY FATHER SHE WENT SLOWLY AWAY
THEY WERE SHOWN AT ONCE INTO THE APARTMENT IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR SAT WAITING FOR THEM
SHE WAS VERY LOVELY WHEN SHE FROWNED
A LITTLE RIPPLE OF LIGHT FLASHED BRIEFLY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND FELL LIKE A SHOWER OF SPRAY FROM A FOUNTAIN
SHE WAS LIKE A SLEEP-WALKER WHOSE BRAIN IS PEOPLED BY THE CREATURES OF A DREAM AND WHO HAS NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SUBSTANTIAL REALITIES THAT SURROUND HIM
MR KERSTALL
I CUT THE TWINE AND OPENED THE BOX
HE STARTED AND LIFTED HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSTURE
I'VE SEEN IT FOR A LONG TIME COMING TO A CRISIS
YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
BY THE WAY IT'S RATHER A SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THERE IS I BELIEVE NO PORTRAIT OF HENRY DUNBAR IN EXISTENCE
HENRY DUNBAR WAS HIMSELF THE FIRST PERSON EXAMINED
HAVE YOU SEEN TO ALL THAT HE ASKED
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER IT NOW FROM THE FIRST SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN HER MIND--FROM THE VERY FIRST SHE HAD BUT ONE IDEA
ALL THE WIDTH OF THIRTY-FIVE YEARS BETWEEN THE PRESENT HOUR AND THAT DAY MIGHT NOT BE WIDE ENOUGH TO SEPARATE THE MEMORY OF THE PAST FROM THE THOUGHTS WHICH WERE BUSY THIS MORNING IN THE MIND OF HENRY DUNBAR
MY OWN HEART TOLD ME THE ARGUMENT WAS FALSE AND COWARDLY
HE PLACED A PAIR OF TALL WAX-CANDLES UPON THE TABLE
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE SUCH AN ASSERTION AS THAT
WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS CAREFULLY COMPACTLY AND QUICKLY LIKE A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO DO ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS HE TIED THE HANDKERCHIEF FULL OF STONES TO THE WHIPCORD THAT BOUND THE BROWN-PAPER PARCEL AND DROPPED BOTH PACKAGES INTO THE WATER
WHO'S TO BLAME FOR ALL THE EVIL YOU HAVE DONE
IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL THIS SUDDEN LOVE WHICH IS BORN OF ONE GLANCE AT THE WONDERFUL FACE THAT HAS BEEN CREATED TO BEWITCH US
HENRY DUNBAR LOVED HER DESPERATELY AS EVEN A SELFISH MAN CAN SOMETIMES LOVE FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE
AND THAT HE SHOULD LIVE HAPPILY WITH HIS WIFE AS HIS ANCESTORS HAD LIVED WITH THEIR WIVES
FAREWELL
THERE'S SO MUCH CONNECTED WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS THAT NEVER GETS INTO THE PAPERS THAT REALLY IT'S QUITE INTERESTING TO HEAR OF EM FROM AN EYE-WITNESS THE WAITER WENT AWAY PLEASED AND RE-ASSURED AFTER CLEARING THE TABLE VERY SLOWLY
AND I'M SURE THAT EVERY ATTENTION WHICH THE PROPRIETOR MR I MUST GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE TO-NIGHT SAID MR DUNBAR INTERRUPTING THE SURGEON RATHER UNCEREMONIOUSLY
THE CONSTABLE WALKED WITH US
MR DUNBAR DECLINES TO SEE YOU HE SAID TO MARGARET
IT WAS HE WHOM I SENT TO MEET YOU KNOWING THAT HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE OFFICE WHO REMEMBERED YOU OR WHOM YOU REMEMBERED SAMPSON WAS TAKEN ILL UPON THE WAY ACCORDING TO HIS BROTHER'S STORY MR DUNBAR ANSWERED
I HAD SEEN THE SCIENCE OF THE DETECTIVE POLICE SO INVARIABLY TRIUMPHANT OVER THE BEST-PLANNED SCHEMES OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS CRIMINALS THAT I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED--HAD I EVER DEBATED THE QUESTION WHICH I NEVER DID--JOSEPH WILMOT'S EVASION OF JUSTICE AN ACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY
YES I AM MOST ANXIOUS THAT HE SHOULD BE FOUND
BUT IF LITTLE TRIVIAL THINGS WAS DRAWN OUT OF ONE AND ANOTHER THEY MIGHT HELP YOU SEE SIR THERE COULD BE NO END GAINED BY TAKING NOTES OF THIS REPLY SO I AMUSED MYSELF BY MAKING A GOOD NIB TO MY PEN WHILE I WAITED FOR SOMETHING BETTER WORTH JOTTING DOWN
MY WIFE AND I HEAR SOMETIMES THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND ARTHUR LOVELL OF THE NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY SIR PHILIP AND LADY JOCELYN WHO OSCILLATE BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE ABBEY WHEN THEY ARE IN WARWICKSHIRE
HELP ME TO LIFT HIM OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND THEN SEND SOME ONE FOR A DOCTOR THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM WAS LIFTED OUT IN THE ARMS OF THE TWO STRONG MEN
AND NOW SAID MR DUNBAR FILLING HIS GLASS FROM THE STARRY CRYSTAL CLARET-JUG WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME STEPHEN VALLANCE OR MAJOR VERNON OR WHATEVER RIDICULOUS NAME YOU MAY CALL YOURSELF--WHAT IS IT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY I'LL TELL YOU THAT IN A VERY FEW WORDS ANSWERED THE MAJOR QUIETLY
I SAW THAT HE WAS AT FAULT
AND YET NOT ALTOGETHER MISERABLE FOR THE ONE GRAND DISCOVERY OF THE DAY HAS JUSTIFIED MY FAITH IN THE WOMAN I LOVE
THE GOVERNMENT HAD OFFERED TO PAY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO SHOULD GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD LEAD TO THE APPREHENSION OF THE GUILTY PARTY OR PARTIES
MR CARTER LAUGHED A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE LAUGH
THE BANKER AND THE MAN WHO WAS CALLED THE MAJOR TALKED TO EACH OTHER EARNESTLY ENOUGH THROUGHOUT THE SHORT DRIVE BETWEEN LISFORD CHURCHYARD AND MAUDESLEY ABBEY
WAIT A MINUTE MISS HE SAID
HE IS PERFECTLY INFLEXIBLE UPON THIS POINT
DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
I'M VERY ILL I SAW A PHYSICIAN WHILE I WAS IN LONDON
AND EVERY MORNING WHEN I TOOK UP THE PAPERS I EXPECTED TO SEE A PROMINENT ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE LONG-UNDISCOVERED WINCHESTER MYSTERY WAS AT LAST SOLVED AND THAT THE MURDERER HAD BEEN TAKEN BY ONE OF THE DETECTIVE POLICE
ARTHUR LOVELL WAS NOT DISPLEASED TO PERCEIVE THIS AGITATION
EVERY ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN PROTESTED LOUDLY AND INDIGNANTLY AGAINST THE IDEA OF THE BARE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY SUSPICION OR THE SHADOW OF A SUSPICION COULD ATTACH TO SUCH A MAN AS MR DUNBAR
AND HE COULD HEAR THE DEEP VOICE OF PHILIP JOCELYN TALKING TO THE CLERGYMAN IN THE PORCH AS HE WAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARRIAGES FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY
WHY DID THEY DRAG THE WATER HE CRIED AGAIN
AND THOUGH MISS DUNBAR COULD NOT HAVE HAD A MORE DEVOTED DUENNA SHE MIGHT CERTAINLY HAVE HAD A MORE ACTIVE ONE
A NEW LIFE XXII
IT WAS MADE INTO A RUNNING NOOSE THAT HAD BEEN DRAWN TIGHTLY ROUND THE NECK OF THE VICTIM
THE HOARSE SNORTING OF THE ENGINE SOUNDED MONOTONOUSLY IN HIS EARS
SO IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN I WENT OUT FOR A WALK ONE EVENING AT THE END OF THE SECOND WEEK IN JULY MISS LESTER WAS STILL WITHOUT A GOVERNESS
BUT ALWAYS IN THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACES
THE RAIN WAS EVERYWHERE AND THE INCESSANT PITTER-PATTER OF THE DROPS BEATING AGAINST THE WINDOWS OF THE ABBEY MADE A DISMAL SOUND SCARCELY LESS UNPLEASANT TO HEAR THAN THE PERPETUAL LAMENTATION OF THE WINDS WHICH TO-DAY HAD THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES
YOU STILL HOLD TO YOUR ORIGINAL PURPOSE
HIS MANNER WITH THESE GENTLEMEN WAS VERY SIMPLE
LET HER BE SENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS THE WAITER LEFT THE ROOM
I HAVE HEARD GRANDPAPA SAY SO AGAIN AND AGAIN
THREE MINUTES AFTER THE BELL HAD RUNG OUR PARLOUR-MAID CAME INTO THE ROOM AND PLACED SOMETHING ON THE TABLE BEFORE ME
ALWAYS TENDERLY BUT ALWAYS WITH A SIGH
AND YOU'VE BEEN TRUE TO ME ALIKE IN JOY AND SORROW--THE JOY'S BEEN LITTLE ENOUGH BESIDE THE SORROW POOR CHILD--BUT YOU'VE BORNE IT ALL
BUT BEFORE I GO I WILL TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER
NOW THAT LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN BOUGHT OVER SOMEHOW OR OTHER BY MR DUNBAR
WHO'LL CATCH HER FOR A FI'-POUND NOTE I WILL CRIED A BURLY YOUNG FELLOW IN A SCARLET GUERNSEY AND SHINY BOOTS THAT CAME NEARLY TO HIS WAIST
THE AUGUST NIGHT WAS HOT AND STILL
I SHOULD DOUBT THE FORCE OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY IN THIS CASE MY GOOD SAMPSON HE SAID
HE TOLD MARGARET WILMOT OF WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT HE DID NOT TELL HER THE EXTENT OF THE SACRIFICE WHICH HE HAD MADE FOR HER SAKE
THE FIRST THRILL OF TERROR THE FIRST SHOCK OF SURPRISE WERE OVER
WHAT'S HIS LONDON ADDRESS MR DUNBAR LEFT NO ADDRESS HUMPH
AND IF YOU'VE ANYTHING MORE TO TELL US YOU CAN SAY IT WHILE YOU'RE POURING OUT THE TEA
HE SAW THEIR FACES AND HE REMEMBERED HOW THEY HAD LOOKED AT HIM
DON'T SAY YOU'VE FORGOTTEN A VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE THIS WAS SPOKEN AFTER A PAUSE IN WHICH THE TWO MEN HAD LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS EARNESTLY AS IF EACH HAD BEEN TRYING TO READ THE INMOST SECRETS OF THE OTHER'S SOUL
BUT PEOPLE DON'T THINK MUCH OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND CALCUTTA NOWADAYS
TRY TO FORGET HIM EVEN IF YOU CANNOT FORGIVE
I HAD THOUGHT ALL THIS PHILIP
AND HIS FACE HAD A STERN FIXED LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO HAS NERVED HIMSELF TO MEET SOME CRISIS WHICH HE KNOWS IS NEAR AT HAND
FOR ALTHOUGH THE STATION WORE ITS DREARIEST ASPECT HAVING ONLY JUST BEGUN TO THROB WITH A LITTLE SPASMODIC LIFE IN THE WAY OF AN EARLY GOODS-TRAIN MR CARTER FOUND HIS DEVOTED FOLLOWER PROWLING IN MELANCHOLY LONELINESS AMID A WILDERNESS OF EMPTY CARRIAGES AND SMOKELESS ENGINES WITH THE TURNIP WHITENESS OF HIS COMPLEXION RELIEVED BY A RED NOSE
I'M AN OLD HAND AND I DON'T WANT TO BE FOUND OUT IN A MISTAKE I SAID NO MORE AFTER THIS
LEAVE ME OR I WILL RUN OUT OF THIS ROOM AND AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD CAN MAKE ME LOVE YOU LESS HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT
BUYING DIAMONDS
THAT IS TO SAY I CLEMENT DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE
BUT IF THEY SHOULD TELEGRAPH TO LONDON OR SHORNCLIFFE SHE BEGAN TO TREMBLE AT THE THOUGHT OF THIS POSSIBILITY
IT MIGHT BE THAT THE BANKER HAD TERRIFIED THIS UNHAPPY GIRL BY SOME AWFUL THREAT THAT HAD PREYED UPON HER MIND AND DRIVEN HER FROM THE MAN WHO LOVED HER WHOM SHE LOVED PERHAPS IN SPITE OF THOSE HEARTLESS WORDS WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN IN THE BITTER HOUR OF THEIR PARTING
IT WAS ANSWERED BY THE GIRL WHOSE FACE WAS TIED UP
AND AS THE TWO MEN WERE DRESSED IN THE SAME FASHION AND HAD PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NONCHALANCE OF MANNER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR A STRANGER TO HAVE DISCOVERED WHICH WAS THE SERVANT AND WHICH THE MASTER
AND THEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT DEATH AND TERROR AND DARKNESS AND ANGUISH AND BEWILDERMENT
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DRAGS CROWDED WITH THE OFFICERS AND THEIR FRIENDS WHO CLUSTERED IN ALL MANNER OF PERILOUS POSITIONS ON THE ROOF AND CONSUMED UNLIMITED CHAMPAGNE BITTER BEER AND LOBSTER-SALAD IN THE PAUSES BETWEEN THE RACES
IT MUST HAVE BEEN BURNING TILL PAST FOUR THIS MORNING HE SAID
I SAW FROM MR CARTER'S COUNTENANCE THAT HE WAS THINKING AND THINKING VERY EARNESTLY
I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SITTING DOZING HERE FOR FULL TWO HOURS
FOR POOR JOSEPH--THAT'S MY BROTHER GENTLEMEN--HAD BEEN EDUCATED A BIT ABOVE HIS STATION BEING MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE SON AND FIFTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME
MY ONLY CHANCE WILL BE THE CHANCE OF AN ACCIDENTAL MEETING WITH HIM
DOES SHE DARE TO SUSPECT ME I FEAR SO HAS SHE SAID AS MUCH NOT IN ACTUAL WORDS
THE INSCRIPTION ON THE CARD WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND A VERY PRETTY HAND--ELEGANT BUT NOT ILLEGIBLE FIRM AND YET FEMININE
AND AS I DID SO THE FIGURE SEEMED TO ME TO RECEDE AND DISAPPEAR
I WILL SEND HER AWAY FROM ME NOW THAT SHE MAY BE MY BLESSING BY-AND-BY WHEN I RETURN TO ENGLAND AFTER MY FATHER'S DEATH HENRY DUNBAR HAD SWORN WHEN HE LEFT THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE FORGERY THAT HE WOULD NEVER LOOK UPON HIS FATHER'S FACE AGAIN,--AND HE KEPT HIS OATH
I THOUGHT THEREFORE THAT HER VISIT WAS VERY ILL-TIMED AND I LET HER SEE THAT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HER WERE ENTIRELY CHANGED
HE HAD NEGLECTED HER THOUGH WITH EVERY PASSING YEAR SHE GREW MORE AND MORE LIKE HER DEAD MOTHER UNTIL AT LAST AT EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD GROWN INTO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH HAZEL-BROWN HAIR AND HAZEL EYES TO MATCH
I THINK THE LISFORD BEADLE WHO WAS A SOUND TORY OF THE OLD SCHOOL ALMOST WONDERED THAT THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES SHOULD BE AUDACIOUS ENOUGH TO WET THE UNCOVERED HEAD OF THE LORD OF JOCELYN'S ROCK
HE HAD RESOLVED THEREFORE TO GET RID OF THIS OLD ACCOMPLICE THIS DANGEROUS WITNESS OF THE PAST
GO AND ORDER THE CARRIAGE AND LOSE NO TIME ABOUT IT THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW HALF AN HOUR AFTER THIS THE TWO MEN LEFT SOUTHAMPTON IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE WITH THE BANKER'S PORTMANTEAU DRESSING-CASE AND DESPATCH-BOX AND JOSEPH WILMOT'S CARPET-BAG
CHAPTER XL
AND YET THAT'S NOT LIKELY
MAJOR VERNON STRUCK ACROSS THIS PATH FOLLOWING THE TRACKS OF LATE FOOTSTEPS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THUS TOOK THE NEAREST WAY TO THE ABBEY
BUT HIS COMING MAY CHANGE HER
IS THAT YOU ARTHUR HE ASKED
AND AT SUCH A TIME HE IS CALLED UPON TO FACE THE WORLD WITH A BOLD FRONT AND SO TO FASHION HIS WORDS AND LOOKS THAT HE SHALL DECEIVE THE SECRET WATCHERS
BUT HEARING NONE CONCLUDED THAT SHE HAD FOUND HER WAY TO THE SERVANTS HALL WHERE SHE HAD MOST LIKELY SOME BUSINESS OR OTHER WITH ONE OF THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
HE WAS NOT VERY MUCH AFRAID OF DEATH HOWEVER
IN DAILY COMPANIONSHIP WITH A MISERABLE WRETCH WHOSE LIFE MUST BE MADE HIDEOUS TO HIMSELF BY THE MEMORY OF HIS CRIME
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE BANKER'S MANNER THAT DECLARED HIM TO BE A PERSON OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE
AND JOSEPH WILMOT SITTING NEAR THE FOOT OF THE BED WATCHED IT WITH A GLOOMY FACE
GUILT STARES YOU BOLDLY IN THE FACE FOR GUILT IS HARDENED AND DEFIANT AND HAS THIS ONE GRAND SUPERIORITY OVER INNOCENCE--THAT IT IS PREPARED FOR THE WORST
BUT THE QUESTION IS WOULD YOU OBJECT TO THE NOISE OF THE PIANO WHILE YOU ARE AT HOME WOULD I OBJECT
LAURA DUNBAR'S DISAPPOINTMENT
THE TWO MISS MELVILLES DORA MACMAHON AND ARTHUR LOVELL RODE IN THE SAME CARRIAGE
I FOLLOWED HIM TO THE SPOT WHERE THE CONSTABLE AND TWO MEN WHO HAD BEEN DRAGGING THE STREAM WERE GATHERED ROUND A BUNDLE OF WET RUBBISH LYING ON THE GROUND
HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE ACCIDENT ITSELF AND HE HAD QUITE LOST THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT OR INDEED FROM THE TIME OF HIS LEAVING MAUDESLEY ABBEY
BUT WHAT IF YOU SHOULD BE MISTAKEN
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO SPARE
WHERE IN THE VERY PLACE WHERE YOU PARTED FROM THIS MR WILMOT SIR GOOD GOD
BUT SPLENDOUR THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODERN ELEGANCE THAT WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOMS OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY
AND YET SHE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT PHILIP JOCELYN LOVED HER YOUNG MISTRESS
BUYING DIAMONDS XXIX
A LITTLE LOW WOODEN GATE PAINTED WHITE AND ONLY FASTENED BY A LATCH
HIS LONG MUSCULAR LIMBS GAVE EVIDENCE OF GREAT PHYSICAL POWER
DON'T SAY YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ME MR DUNBAR HE SAID
IF SUCH A TRAVELLER APPEARED SAWNEY TOM WAS TO STICK TO HIM WHEREVER HE WENT
WELL THERE WAS HIS CARPET-BAG AND HIS RAILWAY-RUG JUST AS HE'D LEFT EM AND THERE WAS A LITTLE TABLE NEAR THE FIRE ALL LAID OUT SNUG AND COMFORTABLE READY FOR HIM
WHAT'S A THOUSAND OR SO MORE OR LESS TO THE SENIOR PARTNER IN THE HOUSE OF D D AND B
BECAUSE ONCE SINNED HE CAN NEVER DO WELL
SOME TIME BETWEEN TWO AND THREE O'CLOCK MRS AUSTIN OPENED THE DOOR OF HER ROOM AND FOUND HER SON LINGERING IN THE CORRIDOR
I MAY GO RATHER RECKLESSLY TO WORK AND MAKE A LARGE INVESTMENT IN THIS NECKLACE
THIS WAS ONE THING YOU NOTICED
GOOD MORNING SIR PHILIP HE SAID
AND BRIGMAWL DO SAY NOW THAT IT AIN'T A BIT OF USE THAT MR DUNBAR DO WHAT HE WOULD COULDN'T FIND THE KEY OF HIS OWN DESK FOR EVER SO LONG HE WAS CONFUSED I SUPPOSE
HOWEVER I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO SUBMIT TO ANY EXAMINATION THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE SO UPON THE SECOND NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND HENRY DUNBAR CHIEF OF THE WEALTHY HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY SLEPT IN WINCHESTER GAOL
THEN HE SAID QUIETLY I AM VERY GLAD YOU HAVE CONFIDED IN ME MISS WILMOT AND BELIEVE ME YOU SHALL NOT FIND ME SLOW TO HELP YOU WHENEVER MY SERVICES CAN BE OF ANY AVAIL
I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MATTER BECAUSE MY SON IS EMPLOYED IN MR DUNBAR'S BANK
I WAITED UNTIL CLOSE UPON THE HOUR AT WHICH I HAD ORDERED DINNER AT THE GEORGE THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH THE CORONER LOOKED VERY THOUGHTFUL
AND MANY A CRUEL SORROW AROSE OUT OF THAT SIN PERHAPS TO LIE HEAVY AT HIS DOOR SOME DAY OR OTHER SOONER OR LATER SOONER OR LATER
A DEAL YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW ABOUT SUCH THINGS
YOU CAN TELL HIM I COME FROM THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
MAJOR VERNON WALKED BRISKLY DOWN THE LONG AVENUE LEADING TO THE LODGE-GATES
IN MY MIND HENRY DUNBAR STOOD SELF-CONDEMNED BY THE EVIDENCE OF HIS OWN CONDUCT AS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT JOSEPH WILMOT
SO PHILIP JOCELYN WAS ACCEPTED
AS CLEAN AS EVER A MAN ESCAPED YET
I READ MY BOOKS OR PAPERS OR STROLL UPON THE LAWN WHILE THE LESSON IS GOING ON AND EVERY NOW AND THEN I HEAR MARGARET'S--I REALLY MUST WRITE OF HER AS MARGARET
MASTER'S VERY CAREFUL OF HIS CELLAR SIR THE WAITER WENT AWAY IMPRESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A COUPLE OF CONNOISSEURS
IT CAN BUY FLATTERY AND SIMULATED LOVE AND SHAM DEVOTION BUT IT CANNOT BUY ONE GENUINE HEART-THROB ONE THRILL OF TRUE FEELING
THEN THEY DISAPPEARED AND THE FEW MINUTES DURING WHICH THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT SEEMED AN AGE TO THAT ANXIOUS WATCHER
BUT SHE VERY QUICKLY REGAINED HER SELF-CONTROL AND CONTINUED SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY LOOKING EARNESTLY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE WITH HER CLEAR BROWN EYES I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LAST NIGHT THAT MY FATHER'S NAME WAS WILMOT
I BEG OF YOU TO DELIVER TO LADY JOCELYN THE DIAMONDS I PLACE IN YOUR HANDS
IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOW AND THE SERVANTS HAD LEFT THE ROOM AT MIDNIGHT
IT WAS THE DATE OF THE SHORNCLIFFE STEEPLE-CHASES AND THE BARONET HAD ENGAGED HIMSELF EARLY IN THE PRECEDING SPRING TO RIDE HIS THOROUGH-BRED MARE GUINEVERE FOR A CERTAIN SILVER CUP SUBSCRIBED FOR BY THE OFFICERS STATIONED AT THE SHORNCLIFFE BARRACKS
FOR IF EVER I AM TO WIN LAURA DUNBAR I MUST SUCCEED IN LIFE
THERE HE FOUND ALL VERY QUIET
GOOD MORNING MISS DUNBAR
LORD ADOLPHUS VANLORME WAS A CUSTOMER OF THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR AND DUNBAR
THE FACES THAT ONCE LOOKED KINDLY ON HIM TURN AWAY FROM HIM WITH A FROWN
THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE TRIUMPH IN THE GRIN OF THAT WINCHESTER CONSTABLE--THE TRIUMPH OF A COUNTRY OFFICIAL WHO WAS PLEASED TO SEE A LONDONER AT FAULT
BUT THE DOOR OF THE DREAD CHAMBER WAS LOCKED AND NO ONE WAS TO ENTER UNTIL THE COMING OF THE CORONER
AND THEN THEY SENT ME FOR A FLY AND I WENT TO THE ROSE AND CROWN AT LISFORD AND FETCHED A FLY
OLD NEWSPAPERS PALE WITH AGE AND WITH PASSAGES HERE AND THERE MARKED BY THICK STROKES IN FADED INK
AND WHO AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND DUG OR RATHER SCOOPED FOR HIMSELF A CAVE OUT OF THE CLIFF-SIDE WITH NO BETTER TOOLS THAN HIS OWN FINGER-NAILS WHICH HE NEVER CUT AFTER THE UNFORTUNATE LADY'S FOUL MURDER
WE HAVE ADDED A NURSERY WING ALREADY TO ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND HAVE BALANCED IT ON THE OTHER BY A VINERY BUILT AFTER THE MODEL OF THOSE WHICH ADORN THE MANSION OF MY SENIOR
AS I OFTEN SAY TO MY OLD MISSUS I DON'T BELIEVE AS EVER ENGLAND HAS HELD UP ITS HEAD SINCE THE DAY WHEN CHARLES THE MARTYR LOST HIS'N LAURA DUNBAR WENT UP THE NARROW PATHWAY BY HER FATHER'S SIDE
SHE WAS VERY POOR AND SHE KNEW THAT HER RELATIONS IN ENGLAND WERE VERY LITTLE BETTER OFF THAN HERSELF
THAT'S WHY THE WATCH AND CHAIN CHANGED HANDS
HE MARRIED A LADY OF RANK
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD OF HIM THE LANDLORD SHOOK HIS HEAD
ONE YOUNG LADY DECLARED THAT SHE WAS FONDER OF MUSIC THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
AND THOUGH I CUT ABOUT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE LOOKIN FOR HIM UNTIL I'D NEARLY WALKED MY LEGS OFF IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME I DIDN'T SEE A SIGN OF HIM AND ALL I COULD DO WAS TO GO BACK TO THE VICTORIER AND SEE IF HE'D GONE BACK BEFORE ME
SUCH A TOUCH SUCH BRILLIANCY
HE WORKED EARLY AND LATE DURING THE MONTH IN WHICH HE REMAINED AT HIS POST PREPARING THE LEDGERS BALANCING ACCOUNTS AND MAKING THINGS STRAIGHT AND EASY FOR THE NEW CASHIER
AND I AM FAIN TO SAY THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THIS FOOLISH AND REPREHENSIBLE INDULGENCE HAD BEEN TO MAKE THE YOUNG HEIRESS OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY THE MOST FASCINATING WOMAN IN ALL WARWICKSHIRE
DID THEY FIND IT
MR KERSTALL SENIOR BEGAN TO BE QUITE INTERESTED IN HIS SON'S PROCEEDINGS AND CONTEMPLATED THE YOUNGER MAN'S OPERATIONS WITH A PERPETUAL CHUCKLING AND NODDING OF THE HEAD THAT WERE EXPRESSIVE OF UNMITIGATED SATISFACTION
I ONLY WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY CLEMENT SHE SAID
TELL ME THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ME
HE FOUND THE DOOR OF THE CHURCH AJAR EARLY THOUGH IT WAS AND GOING IN SOFTLY HE CAME UPON THE TORY BEADLE AND SOME DAMP CHARITY CHILDREN
SOMETIMES FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE SEEMED BETTER OFF
HAD CLEMENT PROPOSED A TRIP TO THE MOON SHE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE KNOWN HOW TO REFUSE HIM HER COMPANY ON THE EXPEDITION
I MAY RIDE THOUGH I CAN'T WALK HE TOOK UP HIS CANE AND WENT TO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A DOOR THAT OPENED INTO THE QUADRANGLE IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE ABBEY HAD CAUSED A LOOSE BOX TO BE BUILT FOR HIS FAVOURITE HORSE
EVEN YOUR PLEADING SHALL NOT TURN ME FROM MY PURPOSE
LIKEWISE HER PAPA WHICH HAD BEEN QUITE THE GENTLEMAN ATTENDING CHURCH TWICE EVERY SUNDAY AS REGULAR AS THE DAY CAME ROUND AND BEING QUITE A PICTURE OF RESPECTABILITY WITH HIS VENERABLE PIOUS-LOOKING GREY HAIR I GAVE A LITTLE START AS I HEARD THIS
SHE WILL HATE ME NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF BRINGING HIS MOST HIDEOUS CRIME TO LIGHT YES THE CRIME WAS HIDEOUS--ALMOST UNPARALLELED IN HORROR
NO MESSENGER FROM YOU OR ANY ONE ELSE HAS CALLED AT THE FERNS THIS AFTERNOON MR DUNBAR STARTED SUDDENLY TO HIS FEET AND STARED AT THE LANDLORD
FIVE O'CLOCK STRUCK ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER MARGARET WILMOT HAD ENTERED THE PARK AND CLEMENT THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT EVEN IF MARGARET WERE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BANKER THAT INTERVIEW WOULD BE OVER BEFORE SIX
IT WASN'T LIKELY HE'D STOP HERE TO BE CAUGHT THE DETECTIVE RANG THE BELL
I SHALL HAVE THE WATER NEAR THE SCENE OF THE MURDER DRAGGED
HE HAS GROWN OLDER AND STOUTER AND GREYER
THE TWO MEN LINGERED UPON THE LANDING-PLACE FOR A FEW MINUTES
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BARRISTER MR LOVELL HE SAID
AND AN ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY-FIVE DRESSED UNLIKE THE REST OF THE TRAVELLERS IN FINE BROADCLOTH WITH A BLACK-SATIN CRAVAT A GOLD PIN A CAREFULLY BRUSHED HAT AND VARNISHED BOOTS
MY POOR GIRL COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HOLD IT NO DISGRACE TO MAKE HER MY WIFE IN SPITE OF THE HIDEOUS STORY CONNECTED WITH HER NAME
FLIGHT XLI
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN GALLIVANTING YOU DEAR OLD MADDEN SHE CRIED WITH A JOYOUS SILVER LAUGH THAT WAS LIKE THE RIPPLE OF A CASCADE UNDER A SUNNY SKY
YOU SEE SIR WHEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN WENT THROUGH THE YARD THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK WAS CHIMING THE QUARTER AFTER FOUR
AND SHE PROPOSED THAT MARGARET SHOULD TAKE A PRETTILY FURNISHED FIRST-FLOOR IN A PLEASANT-LOOKING DETACHED HOUSE HALF COTTAGE HALF VILLA AT CLAPHAM AND AT ONCE SET TO WORK AS A TEACHER OF THE PIANO
AND IF YOU'LL TELL THE COOK TO DEVIL THE THIGH OF A TURKEY WITH PLENTY OF CAYENNE-PEPPER AND A SQUEEZE OF LEMON I SHALL BE OBLIGED
SHE WANTED TO GO BACK TO LONDON SHE SAID
HE KNEW THIS--YES AMIDST EVERY OTHER CONFLICTING THOUGHT THIS MAN WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HIS DAUGHTER AVOIDED HIM
THE LAD REACHED THE BANKING HOUSE IN AN HOUR'S TIME AND WAS BROUGHT STRAIGHT INTO THE PRIVATE ROOM WHERE WE HAD ALL BEEN SITTING IN SILENCE WAITING FOR HIM
HE LOOKED VERY HANDSOME VERY ARISTOCRATIC WITH HIS GREY MOUSTACHE CAREFULLY TRIMMED AND A WHITE CAMELLIA IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE
THERE WERE LAMPS HERE AND THERE BUT THEY ONLY MADE SEPARATE SPLOTCHES OF LIGHT IN THE DUSKY ATMOSPHERE
WOODBINE COTTAGE IS ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM HERE AND LITTLE BETTER THAN A MILE FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY
WHY IS IT ELIZABETH DEAR MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME CRIED MRS MADDEN HOW SHOULD I TELL MY PRECIOUS PET
SHE SAT IN ONE CHANGELESS ATTITUDE WITH HER HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER IN HER LAP AND HER EYES ALWAYS LOOKING STRAIGHT FORWARD AS THEY HAD LOOKED WHEN SHE WALKED UPON THE PLATFORM
I HAD THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MARGARET SHOULD BE IN WINCHESTER AND I WAS ONLY RIGHT IT SEEMED FOR THE YOUNG LADY DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM ME ABRUPTLY AND WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AS IF SHE MISTOOK MY ERROR IN ADDRESSING HER FOR AN INTENTIONAL INSULT
WHAT ON EARTH CAN IT BE I TORE OFF THE WHITE PAPER COVERING AND REVEALED JUST SUCH AN OBJECT AS I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE--A BOX A COMMON-PLACE PASTEBOARD BOX TIED SECURELY ACROSS AND ACROSS WITH THIN TWINE
THE ROOMS WERE GRAND AND BIG WITH BOW WINDOWS SO SPOTLESS IN THEIR CLEANNESS THAT THEY HAD RATHER A COLD EFFECT ON A JANUARY DAY AND WERE APT TO INSPIRE IN THE VULGAR MIND THE FANCY THAT A LITTLE DIRT OR SMOKE WOULD LOOK WARMER AND MORE COMFORTABLE
WHEN THE BARBER HAD COMPLETED HIS WORK JOSEPH WILMOT WASHED HIS FACE READJUSTED THE HAIR UPON HIS AMPLE FOREHEAD AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN A LITTLE SHAVING-GLASS THAT HUNG AGAINST THE WALL
IF HE DOESN'T RUN AWAY HE SAID STANDING QUITE STILL AND RUBBING HIS CHIN SLOWLY WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND
HERE HE ASCERTAINED ALL PARTICULARS ABOUT THE STARTING OF THE TRAINS FOR LONDON AND HERE HE KEPT WATCH WHILE TWO OR THREE TRAINS STARTED
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO PRAY THAT OUR BRAINS AND HEARTS MAY WITHER LEAVING US NO POWER TO LOOK BACK UPON THE PAST
SHE BEGAN TO FIDGET WITH THE SILVER TEA-CANISTERS
HE BOUGHT ONE AT A SHOP NEAR THE QUAY AND WAS BACK TO THE STEPS IN TEN MINUTES
AND WAS NEVER TIRED OF HER BEAUTY OR IMPATIENT OF HER FAULTS
IT CAN'T MUCH MATTER TO HIM WHETHER I TAKE HIM NOW OR WHEN HE GETS TO COPENHAGEN
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY I CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN'S CARRYINGS ON
YOU MUST ALLOW SOMETHING FOR THE PASSAGE OF TIME MY DEAR LOVELL AND THE WEAR AND TEAR OF A LIFE IN CALCUTTA
BUT HE HEARD THE CONSTABLE SAY THAT THOSE RAGS WERE THE CLOTHES THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE MURDERED MAN WHAT THEN
AND IN VERY NEARLY SEVEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WE HAVE NEVER FOUND ANY DISUNION TO ARISE FROM THIS ARRANGEMENT
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOIN TO DO IF ANYBODY'S CURIOUS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS MR TIBBLES NODDED AND RETIRED TO AN INNER APARTMENT WHENCE HE EMERGED BY-AND-BY DRESSED IN A SHABBY-GENTEEL COSTUME OF SOMEWHAT FUNEREAL ASPECT AND WITH THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE RASPED LIKE A FRENCH ROLL AND SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THAT EDIBLE IN COLOUR
THERE WAS A BRIDLE-PATH THROUGH THE PARK TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED LISFORD
VENETIAN GLASSES AND OLD CRYSTAL CHANDELIERS GLIMMERED AND GLITTERED AGAINST THE SOMBRE WOODWORK
I SHOULDN'T IF I WAS GOIN TO BE OWN WIFE TO A BARONET LAURA DUNBAR TOOK VERY LITTLE NOTICE OF HER NURSE'S RAMBLING DISCOURSE
THE MAJOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE LEASE AT A FAIR PRICE AND THE FURNITURE AS IT STOOD BY VALUATION
VERY SATISFACTORY FOR A FIRST GO-IN AT THE GOLD-DIGGIN'S
WE MAY BE OUT ALL NIGHT IF WE TRY TO CATCH YON VESSEL MR CARTER GAVE THE MAN A SOVEREIGN AND TOLD HIM TO GET WHAT HE THOUGHT PROPER
HE WILL BE WORTH A MILLION OF MONEY I SHOULD FANCY
PLENTY--FOR YOU THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SIGHED HEAVILY
I RANG FOR WINE AND MADE HER TAKE SOME
IT WAS A DULL MISTY DAY AND THERE WAS A LOW WIND WAILING AMONGST THE WET BRANCHES OF THE OLD TREES
SOMETIMES THOSE GLITTERING EYES STROVE TO PIERCE THE GLOOM AND TO SEE THE OTHER FACES THE FACES THAT WERE FARTHER AWAY FROM THE FLICKERING YELLOW LIGHT OF THE WAX-CANDLES
PRAY DON'T WAIT FOR ME
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OFTEN POINTS TO AN INNOCENT PERSON
YOU'VE SEEN ALL THIS AND SUFFERED FROM IT
AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE GRAND ENTRANCE OF THE ABBEY THE STRANGER LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE MUD-SPATTERED WINDOW
AND THE BONDAGE YOU ACCEPTED WHEN YOU PROMISED TO BE MY WIFE IS A BONDAGE THAT CANNOT SO EASILY BE SHAKEN OFF MARGARET WATCHED HER LOVER'S FACE WITH MELANCHOLY TEARLESS EYES
I'M NO CREDIT TO ANY ONE--LEAST OF ALL TO A STEADY RESPECTABLE OLD CHAP LIKE YOU JOSEPH!--JOSEPH GASPED THE OLD CLERK
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A NERVOUS RESTLESSNESS IN HIS MANNER
BUT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO RELIEVE THESE AFFLICTED ONES AND TO COMFORT THEM MORE OR LESS
FOR THERE WAS AN EMPTY POCKET-BOOK FOUND BY THE WATER'S EDGE
IT WAS BRIGHT MOONLIGHT AND THE LITTLE BOAT LEFT A TRAIL OF TREMULOUS SILVER IN HER WAKE AS SHE CUT THROUGH THE WATER
WHAT OTHER REASON COULD THERE BE FOR HIS PERSISTENT AVOIDANCE OF HER
I HAVEN'T LOST MY ARISTOCRATIC TASTE FOR SEVEN COURSES AND AN ELEGANT SUCCESSION OF STILL FINE SPARKLING WINES THOUGH DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE BEEN RATHER FREQUENTLY CONSTRAINED TO ACCEPT THE SHADOWY HOSPITALITY OF HIS GRACE OF HUMPHREY
BUT THE DOORS BEING VERY THICK YOU AIN'T CERTAIN
ARTHUR LOVELL WORKED NOBLY IN THE SERVICE OF LAURA'S FATHER
STARING AT ME WITH ONE FIXED UNVARYING STARE AND FINGERING MUSICAL PASSAGES UPON HIS KNEES WITH SLOW CAUTIOUS MOTIONS OF HIS FINGERS AND THUMBS
THE DEAD MAN'S ANTECEDENTS COULD HAVE THROWN LITTLE LIGHT UPON THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD MET HIS DEATH
STRANGE HE SAID THAT YOU WHO SAY YOU ARE HIS BROTHER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE ME INFORMATION UPON THAT POINT JOSEPH WILMOT ANSWERED WITH AN AIR OF CARELESSNESS THAT WAS ALMOST CONTEMPTUOUS
AND THAT I SHALL ONLY STUDY MY OWN EASE AND COMFORT
THEY WERE NEVER TIRED OF EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY OR AT A STAND-STILL FOR WANT OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER
AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE COTTAGE SIR YOU'RE VERY GOOD SAID MR CARTER WITH SOMETHING LIKE A GROAN
HOW DO THE UP-TRAINS GO ON A SUNDAY HE ASKED
THE CHIEF WITNESS UPON THIS DAY WAS THE VERGER
BE MY OWN DEAR INDULGENT MOTHER AS YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND PACK ME A COUPLE OF CLEAN SHIRTS IN A PORTMANTEAU
I AM GOING AWAY CLEMENT--MR AUSTIN
CAN YOU STAND STILL MORE EH FOR YOUR SAKE FATHER FOR YOUR SAKE
A FEW SOVEREIGNS
I WAS VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT HE WAS DEAD
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPENDING HIS DAYS VERY MUCH IN THIS MANNER
THE YOUNG PERSON SAYS THAT SHE MUST SEE YOU SIR THE MAN SAID
HE HAD BEEN VERY WICKED AND HAD NEED OF A LONG LIFE OF PENITENCE SHE THOUGHT
HERE IS YOUR PURSE FATHER SHE SAID THRUSTING IT INTO HIS HAND
I DO NOT LOVE YOU IT WAS ALL A FARCE THEN--A DELUSION--IT WAS ALL FALSEHOOD AND TRICKERY FROM FIRST TO LAST
WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO WALK UP AND DOWN A FEW YARDS OF HARD DUSTY HIGH-ROAD UPON A BLEAK EVENING IN JANUARY AN HOUR MORE OR LESS IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE
A YOUNG PERSON EXCLAIMED MR DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY
THE MAN WHOSE INFLUENCE BLIGHTED MY FATHER'S LIFE AND MADE HIM WHAT HE WAS
THE BODY LAY A FORM OF MOTIONLESS AND SENSELESS CLAY UNDER THE WHITE COUNTERPANE
THE WIDOW STARTED UP AT THE SOUND OF THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND HER SON'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS
OUR CHIEF WAS HANDSOME YOU SAY IN HIS YOUTH YES SIR SAMPSON WILMOT ANSWERED HE WAS VERY HANDSOME--TALL AND FAIR WITH BRIGHT BLUE EYES YOU HAVE SEEN MISS DUNBAR
AND WHEN MR DUNBAR CAME BACK I WAS JUST GOING AWAY TO MY TEA AND I SELDOM GO TO MY TEA UNTIL IT'S GONE FIVE BUT SUPPOSING IT TO HAVE STRUCK FIVE WHEN MR DUNBAR RETURNED THAT WOULD ONLY MAKE IT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AFTER THE TIME AT WHICH HE WENT THROUGH THE YARD SUPPOSING HIM TO HAVE GONE THROUGH AS YOU SAY AT THE QUARTER PAST FOUR THE VERGER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AGAIN
YES INDEED THEY SHOULD RATHER THINK SO:--IF EVER THIS SHABBY STRANGER HAD KNOWN MR DUNBAR AND IF HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER AN IMPOSTOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON AT THE TIME OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MILLIONAIRE WHEN AND WHERE DID I KNOW YOU ASKED HENRY DUNBAR WITH HIS EYES STILL LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE OTHER MAN
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IS NOT TO BE
I WENT TO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHERE MY MOTHER WAS STILL SITTING AT WORK NEAR THE OPEN WINDOW
SHE TROUBLES HERSELF VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND I NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS MYSELF INDEED SAID MRS AUSTIN
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR PICTURES FATHER UNFRAMED CANVASES AND UNFINISHED SKETCHES ON MILLBOARD WERE LYING ABOUT THE ROOM IN EVERY DIRECTION PILED AGAINST THE WALL HEAPED ON SIDE-TABLES AND STOWED OUT OF THE WAY UPON SHELVES AND EVERYWHERE THE DUST LAY THICK UPON THEM
TAKE YOUR DOG AWAY LAURA CRIED MR DUNBAR ANGRILY
HE WORE A GREENISH-BROWN GREATCOAT WITH A POODLE COLLAR AND WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WORN THE SAME FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS
SHE WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH TO ME NOW FEARLESSLY
HE PAID THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN AT WORK ALL DAY AND PAID THEM LIBERALLY I SUPPOSE FOR THEY SEEMED VERY WELL SATISFIED
AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO TELL MARGARET WILMOT THAT THE MYSTERY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH WAS A MYSTERY THAT WOULD NEVER BE SOLVED UPON THIS EARTH
MR DUNBAR ASKED ONE OF HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS IF THIS TRAIN WAS ALWAYS PUNCTUAL
I FELT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CLOSE BEHIND ME ALL THE WAY--THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SO
TAKE CARE NOT TO ALARM HER EVERYBODY ABOUT THE STATION HAD COLLECTED ON THE PLATFORM AND MADE A CIRCLE ABOUT MR DUNBAR
BUT I CAN AFFORD TO BE CONTENTED CLEMENT SO LONG AS I HAVE YOU WITH ME CLEMENT WENT BACK TO LONDON
I KNOW HOW UNHAPPY THOSE THOUGHTS ALWAYS MAKE YOU CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD NOT BEEN AT SHORNCLIFFE FOR THREE YEARS
SHE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD THERE FOR A MINUTE OR SO LOOKING OUT
WE'VE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE FISHING ROUND WINCHESTER
WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR WAY OF A DARK NIGHT IN A SWAMPY COUNTRY AND SEE A LIGHT AHEAD DON'T BEGIN TO CLAP YOUR HANDS AND CRY HOORAY TILL YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF LIGHT IT IS
WHICH TELLS ME,--OH TOO PLAINLY!--THAT MY PRESENCE IS UNWELCOME TO HIM
SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW MY FACE FOR MY NEW HOPE HAD GIVEN IT A STRANGE BRIGHTNESS
HENRY DUNBAR'S COUNTENANCE WAS OVERCLOUDED BY A BLACK FROWN AND WAS BY NO MEANS AGREEABLE TO LOOK UPON
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT GIRL
BUT IN THIS SLEEP HE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING GOING ON
THROUGH THE MEADOWS OR BY THE HIGH ROAD BY THE HIGH ROAD SIR
HE HAS GONE AWAY I SUPPOSE AND HE WAS FREE TO GO AWAY WASN'T HE OH
IF THE NEW ZEALANDER SHOULD EXERCISE HIS EDITORIAL DISCRETION AND DELETE MY RAPTURES IT WOULDN'T MATTER
BETWEEN THE ANGLO-INDIAN BANKER AND SIR PHILIP JOCELYN THERE WAS NO SYMPATHY
WHAT SHOULD HENRY DUNBAR WANT WITH JOSEPH WILMOT'S GOLD CHAIN
HE DID SIR
SINCE THEN MISS WENTWORTH HAS COME THREE TIMES A WEEK
AND YOU PUT A CRIMSON CURTAIN BEHIND YOUR SUBJECT AND YOU PUT A BRAN-NEW HAT OR A ROLL OF PAPER IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND YOU THRUST HIS LEFT HAND IN HIS WAISTCOAT--THE BEST BLACK SATIN SIR WITH STRONG LIGHT IN THE TEXTURE--AND YOU MADE YOUR SUBJECT LOOK LIKE A GENTLEMAN
AND I WHO AM SO MUCH A COCKNEY AS TO BELIEVE THAT A LONDON SUNSET IS ONE OF THE GRANDEST SPECTACLES IN THE UNIVERSE SET MY FACE TOWARDS THE YELLOW LIGHT IN THE WEST AND WALKED ACROSS WANDSWORTH COMMON WHERE FAINT WREATHS OF PURPLE MIST WERE RISING FROM THE HOLLOWS AND A DESERTED DONKEY WAS BREAKING THE TWILIGHT STILLNESS WITH A PLAINTIVE BRAYING
THE DUKE MIGHTN'T HAVE BEEN AS RICH A MAN AS I AM IN SPITE OF HIS DUKEDOM NO TO BE SURE SIR THE OLD MAN ANSWERED LOOKING ADMIRINGLY AT THE BANKER AND SIGHING PLAINTIVELY
I DO THINK AS YOU MUST HAVE COME INTO THIS MORTAL SPEAR WITH A WHOLE SERVICE OF GOLD PLATE
THERE WAS SOME TALK OF HIS GOING OUT TO INDIA IN A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT SIR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
HER DARK EYES--AND SHE HAD VERY BEAUTIFUL EYES WITH A GRAVE HALF-PENSIVE SOFTNESS IN THEIR SOMBRE DEPTHS--WERE FIXED UPON THE TWO YOUNG FACES IN THE SUNNY WINDOW
CLEMENT AUSTIN WAS SCARCELY LESS PALE THAN HENRY DUNBAR HIMSELF
I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT VERY LONG FOR MY POOR GIRL CLEMENT THOUGHT AS HE LEFT THE GATES AND WALKED BRISKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD
I SHOULD THINK IT WAS RATHER WET INDEED
WE WERE CLOSE TO THE GEORGE BY THIS TIME AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF THAT BRIGHT SUMMER'S DAY UPON WHICH HENRY DUNBAR AND HIS VICTIM HAD DRIVEN INTO WINCHESTER ON THE FIRST STAGE OF A JOURNEY WHICH ONE OF THEM WAS NEVER TO FINISH
AND MRS MANDERS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WITH BOTH THE ABBEY AND THE ROCK FOR SHE HAD A NIECE WHO WAS UNDER-HOUSEMAID IN THE SERVICE OF HENRY DUNBAR AND A GRANDSON WHO WAS A HELPER IN SIR PHILIP JOCELYN'S STABLES
THE DRIZZLING RAIN DESCENDED ON HIM THOUGH HE WAS A BARONET AND THOUGH HE CAME BAREHEADED TO RECEIVE HIS BRIDE
THANK YOU SIR AND KINDLY TO BE SURE THE OLD MAN CACKLED GRATEFULLY
MR CARTER STOOD LOOKING OVER THE QUAY AND CONTEMPLATING THIS MAN FOR SOME MOMENTS WITH A THOUGHTFUL STARE
MR JOSEPH WILMOT HAD THIS ROOM ALL TO HIMSELF
WE HAD BEEN VERY FRIENDLY TOGETHER AND I HAD A FANCY FOR GOING OVER THE CATHEDRAL
ONE OF THEM WAS TALKING THE OTHER LISTENING AND SMOKING A CIGAR AS HE LISTENED
HIS PICTURE WAS PAINTED WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND EXHIBITED IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY
THIS BELT HAD NEVER QUITTED HIM SINCE THE NIGHT UPON WHICH HE MADE IT
LET A SEARCH BE MADE AT DAYBREAK TO-MORROW MORNING EXCLAIMED MR DUNBAR
BUT THE REASON OF MY RESIGNATION MUST REMAIN A SECRET
BUT I BELIEVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF YOUR FATHER
MR DUNBAR SEEMS TO DOUBT THE FACT OF HIS HAVING HAD A DAUGHTER PERHAPS SO
I'VE A FRIEND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WINCHESTER AN OLD COLLEGE COMPANION A MAN WHO HAS A FINE ESTATE IN HAMPSHIRE AND A HOUSE NEAR ST CROSS
THIS WILL DRAW OUT THE LANDLORD OR THE WAITERS AS THE CASE MAY BE AND WE SHALL GET THE HISTORY OF THE MURDER WITH ALL THAT WAS SAID AND DONE AND THOUGHT AND SUSPECTED AND HINTED AND WHISPERED ABOUT IT
I WILL TALK TO YOU TO-MORROW YOU WILL TELL ME ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED I WILL TALK TO YOU TO-MORROW ANSWERED MARGARET LOOKING AT HER LOVER WITH A WHITE INFLEXIBLE FACE
YOU WILL FIND NO STUPID PREJUDICES IN ME MR LOVELL
BUT IT WAS NEVER TO BE
YOU'LL GO DOWN TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY WITH ME WON'T YOU NO I SAID
HE ACTED ALTOGETHER QUITE THE GENTLEMAN AND PAID FOR THE DRIVER'S DINNER AND BRANDY-AND-WATER AS WELL AS HIS OWN
FOR WHAT MOTIVE COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE HAD FOR MURDERING HIS OLD SERVANT
THE MORNING WAS COLD AND WET
HE LEFT THE ABBEY RAN BACK TO THE LODGE FOUND HIS ASSISTANT MR TIBBLES AND DESPATCHED THAT GENTLEMAN TO THE SHORNCLIFFE RAILWAY STATION WHERE HE WAS TO KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT FOR A LAME TRAVELLER IN A BLUE CLOTH COAT LINED WITH BROWN FUR
AND MOREOVER THE WET WEATHER GAVE HIM A GOOD EXCUSE FOR BUTTONING HIS COAT TO THE CHIN AND TURNING THE POODLE COLLAR OVER HIS BIG RED EARS
MISS WILSON IS THE YOUNG LADY I WISH TO SEE I SAID
AND I VERY MUCH DOUBT IF POSTERITY WILL CARE TO KNOW THAT I WENT TO THE OFFICE AT TEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY MORNING
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO LEAVE THE DARK SECRET OF THE MURDER FOR EVER HIDDEN FROM ALL BUT THAT ONE DREAD AVENGER WHOSE JUDGMENTS REACH THE SINNER IN HIS REMOTEST HIDING-PLACE AND FOLLOW HIM TO THE GRAVE
MAJOR VERNON HAD SEEN JOSEPH WILMOT AND KNEW THAT HE HAD LEFT THE ABBEY AT FOUR O'CLOCK AND THUS GAVE A LITTLE START OF SURPRISE WHEN HE FOUND THAT THE EXACT HOUR WAS KNOWN TO OTHERS
I SAW THIS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOR THE BRIGHT COLOUR FADED OUT OF HER FACE WHILE I WAS SPEAKING TO HER
WHEN MARGARET RETURNED FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY SHE DECLARED HER CONVICTION OF HENRY DUNBAR'S INNOCENCE AND SHE REFUSED TO FULFIL HER ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU SHE DID THE DETECTIVE LEFT OFF FINGERING FUGUES UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO SCRATCH HIS HEAD SLOWLY PUSHING HIS HAND UP AND DOWN AMONGST HIS IRON-GREY HAIR AND STARING AT ME
I WALKED ABOUT--THAT PLACE--UNDER THE ELMS--ALL THE DAY--ONLY ONE DAY--BUT IT SEEMED TO LAST FOR EVER AND EVER
EARLY UPON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO THE BANK MR DUNBAR WENT OUT VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AND HAILED THE FIRST EMPTY CAB THAT HE SAW IN PICCADILLY
AND MR CRICKLEWOOD THE SURGEON PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE THE CORPSE SO AS TO ENABLE HIM TO GIVE EVIDENCE RESPECTING THE CAUSE OF DEATH
I SEE THE MAN HAS BEEN HERE
BUT MANY A GOOD GIRL HAS HAD A BAD FATHER YOU KNOW SIR AND I PUT UP MY HAND TO STOP HIM
WE GOT INTO WINCHESTER AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE DAY
IT WAS TOO BITTER
SHE TOLD IT ME PRESENTLY WHEN I HAD EXPLAINED TO HER IN SOME AWKWARD VAGUE MANNER WHO I WAS AND HOW IT WAS I WANTED TO ENGAGE HER SERVICES
HE HAD LEARNED TO WALK ABOUT THE ROOMS AND ON THE GRAVEL-DRIVE BEFORE THE ABBEY WITH THESE CRUTCHES AND HAD EVEN LEARNED TO DO WITHOUT THEM FOR HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SET THE LAMED FOOT UPON THE GROUND AND TO WALK A FEW PACES PRETTY STEADILY WITH NO BETTER SUPPORT THAN THAT OF HIS CANE
AT FIRST HIS DAUGHTER HAD BROKEN IN UPON HIS SOLITUDE AND WITH BRIGHT CARESSING WAYS HAD TRIED TO WIN HIM FROM HIS LONELINESS
OH YES YOU'RE AN ARTFUL YOUNG HUSSY AND NO MISTAKE HE SAID
HE WAS NOT A VERY PATIENT SUFFERER
I WANT TO SEE MR DUNBAR SHE SAID
BUT HE REACHED SHORNCLIFFE WITHOUT HAVING OVERTAKEN HER AND THE FLY CRAWLED UNDER THE PONDEROUS ARCHWAY BENEATH WHICH THE DASHING MAIL-COACHES HAD ROLLED IN THE DAYS THAT WERE FOR EVER GONE
I TOLD MY DEAR MOTHER THAT MISS WENTWORTH'S HEAD WAS FROM A PHRENOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW MAGNIFICENT AND THAT THE ORGANS OF TIME AND TUNE WERE DEVELOPED TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE
BUT A LITTLE FRIVOLITY MAY BE PARDONED IN TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE SO VERY YOUNG AND SO ENTIRELY HAPPY
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE LOOKED AT ME VERY CLOSELY HAVE YOU MR DUNBAR HE SAID
THE BREAKFAST SERVICE WAS HARMONIOUSLY ADAPTED TO THE SEASON AND EMINENTLY CALCULATED TO PRODUCE A FIT OF SHIVERING IN THE SOJOURNER AT THE REINDEER
I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN SHE HAS SECURED THE PROTECTION OF A GOOD HUSBAND SIR PHILLIP JOCELYN SPRANG UP WITH HIS FACE ALL A-GLOW WITH RAPTURE AND WOULD FAIN HAVE SEIZED THE BANKER'S HAND IN TOKEN OF HIS GRATITUDE
HE PARTED WITH HER NOT BECAUSE OF HIS INDIFFERENCE BUT RATHER BY REASON OF HIS IDOLATRY
ONE OF THE CONSTABLES WAS LOUNGING BY THE WATER'S EDGE WATCHING THE MEN AS THEY PREPARED FOR BUSINESS
I HAVE BEEN CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED MOTHER AND THE SUBJECT IS VERY BITTER TO ME HE SAID
ARE YOU SURE OF THAT MADGE HE ASKED BENDING HIS HEAD TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY IN HER EARNEST FACE
LEAVE THE SINNER WHEREVER HE MAY BE HIDDEN TO THE JUDGMENT OF GOD WHICH PENETRATES EVERY HIDING-PLACE
IT MAY BE GOD'S MERCY THAT YOU SHOULD BE TAKEN AND YOUR WRETCHED DAUGHTER CAN DIE WITH YOU SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES SUDDENLY IN A KIND OF DELIRIUM AND LIFTED UP HER CLASPED HANDS
I UNDERSTAND SO IT WAS ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER THIS BRIEF CONVERSATION AND WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THE TIME AT WHICH THE TRAIN WAS DUE AT RUGBY WHEN THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD ROCKED A GOOD DEAL FROM THE FIRST BEGAN TO OSCILLATE VERY VIOLENTLY
FORTUNE MADE EVERYTHING SMOOTH FOR HIM
I MEANT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU TO TELL YOU TO TELL ME WHAT MARGARET ASKED CLEMENT
IT WAS AN OMINOUS ADDRESS
THE BRIGHT FRANK BOYISH COUNTENANCE LOOKING EAGERLY OUT UPON A WORLD THAT SEEMED SO PLEASANT
OF COURSE IT COULD BE SCARCELY PLEASANT FOR A MILLIONAIRE TO BE CROSS-QUESTIONED IN THIS MANNER BY AN IMPERTINENT HAMPSHIRE CORONER
I FEEL SO OLD TO A MAN WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BE BUSY THERE IS NO AFFLICTION SO INTOLERABLE AS IDLENESS
THE MURDER COULD SCARCELY HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS WAY
NEVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE FORGED BILLS HAD THAT MAN ENTERED THE BANKING-HOUSE
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE PRIVATE PARLOUR IN WHICH THAT WELL-REMEMBERED SCENE HAD OCCURRED FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME BECAUSE I SHALL LEAVE WINCHESTER BY THE MAIL TO-NIGHT WHAT FOR TO GET AS FAST AS I CAN TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY WHERE I SHALL HAVE THE HONOUR OF ARRESTING MR JOSEPH WILMOT SO SOON
GIRLS OF HER AGE ARE AS CHANGEABLE AS THE WINDS OF HEAVEN
I PUT THIS LETTER TO THAT SPEECH IN THE CORRIDOR AT THE REINDEER MR AUSTIN
TELL MR DUNBAR THAT I WILL WAIT AT THE DOOR OF THIS HOUSE TILL HE COMES OUT TO SPEAK TO ME
AND SHE HAD TOLD THE FEW PEOPLE ABOUT THE PLACE WHERE SHE LIVED OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
ALL THROUGH THE LONG FEVERISH RESTLESS NIGHT HE LAY PONDERING OVER THIS MISERABLE INTERRUPTION OF HIS JOURNEY WHILE THE SICK-NURSE AND THE SURGEON'S ASSISTANT ALTERNATELY SLOPPED COOLING LOTIONS ABOUT HIS WRETCHED BROKEN LEG
THE GIRL'S TERROR OF HER MASTER SEEMED GENUINE
I HAVE LOVED YOU TOO MUCH IN THE PAST EVER TO BECOME INDIFFERENT TO YOUR FATE
TO-NIGHT HENRY DUNBAR ONLY SPOKE OF THE MISERY OF BEING IN A STRANGE HOUSE
AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO BUT TO RESIGN MYSELF TO THE EVEN TENOR OF AN EXISTENCE IN WHICH THE QUIET DUTIES OF A BUSINESS CAREER WOULD LEAVE LITTLE TIME FOR ANY IDLE GRIEF OR LAMENTATION
HE HAD NOT HAD AN HOUR'S SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT BUT HAD LAIN IN EVERY VARIETY OF RESTLESS ATTITUDE TOSSING FIRST ON THIS SIDE AND THEN ON THAT
LONELY ENOUGH IN THE DAY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT YES IT SEEMS SO
ARTHUR LOVELL WHO STOOD QUIETLY WATCHING THE MEETING BETWEEN THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER SAW A CHANGE COME OVER HIS CLIENT'S FACE AND WHEELED FORWARD AN ARM-CHAIR JUST IN TIME FOR HENRY DUNBAR TO FALL INTO IT AS HEAVILY AS A LOG OF WOOD
YOU LOOK AS BLACK AS IF YOU HAD COMMITTED A MURDER OR WERE PLOTTING ONE THE OUTCAST SMILED
HUMPH--HA HA--YES ALL THIS WAS IN AN UNDERTONE THAT HUMMED FAINTLY THROUGH THE DETECTIVE'S CLOSED TEETH
IN SPITE OF HIS OBSTINATE DETERMINATION TO AVOID AN INTERVIEW WITH HER SHE WOULD SEE HIM
BUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HENRY DUNBAR AND A BALD-HEADED COMMERCIAL-LOOKING GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE TO HIM WENT ON READING THEIR NEWSPAPERS AS COOLLY AS IF THE ROCKING OF THE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN NO MORE PERILOUS THAN THE LULLABY MOTION OF AN INFANT'S CRADLE GUIDED BY A MOTHER'S GENTLE FOOT
A WOMAN'S HEART MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LESS THAN WOMANLY IF IT COULD HAVE TAILED TO APPRECIATE MY DARLING'S DEVOTION
I TOLD HIM OF THE GIRL'S SEVERAL EFFORTS TO SEE HENRY DUNBAR AND THE BANKER'S PERSISTENT AVOIDANCE OF HER
A LADY HALF BURIED IN SHAWLS AND SURROUNDED BY A LITTLE COLONY OF SMALL PACKAGES WAS SITTING CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND STARTED OUT OF HER SLEEP TO MAKE NERVOUS CLUTCHES AT HER PARCELS AS THE DETECTIVE ENTERED BEING IN THAT SEMI-CONSCIOUS STATE IN WHICH THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE IS APT TO MISTAKE EVERY TRAVELLER FOR A THIEF
NO VALLANCE I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU MR VALLANCE LEANED BACK IN THE CAB BITING HIS NAILS SAVAGELY AND THINKING
IF HIS CLIENT CHOSE TO DO A DISHONOURABLE THING IN SPITE OF ALL THAT THE YOUNG MAN COULD SAY AGAINST IT OF COURSE IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
SHE WALKED VERY FAST
WHAT IF A LESSER STAR THAN THAT WHICH HAD GONE DOWN IN THE DARKNESS MIGHT NOW BE RISING DIM AND DISTANT IN THE PALE GREY SKY
IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE LAST OF ME YOU MUST FIND YOUR WAY SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO WOODBINE COTTAGE NEAR LISFORD--ON THE LISFORD ROAD I THINK
MARGARET SAT BY THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE WITH AN OPEN BOOK BEFORE HER
THERE ALWAYS WAS SOMETHING PRINCELY AND MAGNIFICENT ABOUT YOU MR DUNBAR YOU SHALL NOT HAVE ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN ANSWERED THE BANKER VERY COLDLY
THERE WAS A LOCKET ATTACHED TO THE MASSIVE GOLD CHAIN THE LOCKET WHICH CONTAINED LAURA DUNBAR'S MINIATURE
IT WAS PAST SIX O'CLOCK AND MR DUNBAR HEARD THE VOICES OF THE WOMEN-SERVANTS UPON THE BACK STAIRCASE AS HE WENT TO HIS ROOM
THE DAWN THE EPILOGUE
BUT SIR ARDEN CHECKED IT
AND THEN I'LL COME AND TAKE YOU FOR A WALK BEFORE DINNER
IN ORDER THAT ALL THE WICKED SECRETS OF THE PAST MIGHT BE BURIED WITH HIS VICTIM
YOUR SENTIMENTS ARE LIBERALITY ITSELF MY DEAR FRIEND
I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT GUESSING RIDDLES MR AUSTIN
IT WERE THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST AS A YOUNG WOMAN WRAPPED UP ABOUT THE FACE LIKE AND DRESSED VERY PLAIN GOT OUT OF A FLY AT MY DOOR
AND THE WORLD WHICH RARELY STOPS LONG TO LAMENT FOR THE DEAD BEGAN TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS
LET ME GO AWAY UNQUESTIONED
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE CAN LAST MORE THAN FOUR-AND-TWENTY HOURS THE SURGEON WAITED FOR A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SAYING THIS EXPECTING SOME EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE OR GRIEF FROM THE DYING MAN'S BROTHER
WHEN I DROVE HOME WITH PAPA AFTER THE RACES YESTERDAY EVERYTHING UPON EARTH SEEMED SO BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
A DIAMOND-NECKLACE
IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE AT THE BASINGSTOKE INN AT THE STATION THROUGH THE LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHT AT THE PUBLIC-HOUSE BY THE WATER IN THE TAILOR'S SHOP EVEN WHEN HE WAS MOST OCCUPIED BY THE CHOICE OF HIS CLOTHES HE HAD STILL THOUGHT OF HENRY DUNBAR
VERY WELL THEN WILMOT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO
BUT THE OLD MAN'S SIGHT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS HIS LEGS WERE
BUT INSTEAD OF INSPECTING THE CUPBOARD MR CARTER MADE A SUDDEN RUSH AT THE DOOR LOCKED IT AND THEN PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET
IN A FEW MINUTES--WHILE THE ROOKS WERE CAWING IN THE ELMS AND THE GREEN LEAVES FLUTTERING IN THE DROWSY SUMMER AIR AND THE BLUE WATERS RIPPLING IN THE SUNSHINE AND FLECKED BY THE SHADOWS--JOSEPH WILMOT HAD DONE A DEED WHICH HAD GIVEN HIM THE RICHEST REWARD THAT A MURDERER EVER HOPED TO WIN
CURSE HIM
IF THE COTTAGE SUITS ME HE SAID I DON'T MIND A THOUSAND FOR IT
IT WAS NEW TO HER TO HEAR GENTLE VOICES SWEET CHRISTIAN-LIKE WORDS
THE RAILWAY JOURNEY BETWEEN SHORNCLIFFE AND DERBY WAS BY NO MEANS THE MOST PLEASANT EXPEDITION FOR A COLD SPRING NIGHT WITH THE DARKNESS LYING LIKE A BLACK SHROUD ON THE FLAT FIELDS AND A MELANCHOLY WIND HOWLING OVER THOSE DESOLATE REGIONS ACROSS WHICH ALL NIGHT-TRAINS SEEM TO WEND THEIR WAY
IT WAS IN THE DREARIEST PART OF THE WINTER WHICH FOLLOWED JOSEPH WILMOT'S ESCAPE THAT AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH GAVE ME A STRANGELY-MINGLED FEELING OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
I MEANT TO TAKE THEM UP BEFORE THEY FELL DUE UNCLE HUGH HE SAID
REMEMBER I AM ALMOST AS MUCH A STRANGER IN THIS COUNTRY AS IF I HAD NEVER SET FOOT ON BRITISH SOIL BEFORE TO-DAY
I LEAVE EVERYTHING IN YOUR HANDS
THE WALK IN THE BROILING AFTERNOON SUN HAS KNOCKED ME UP
THIS WAS ENOUGH
THE FISHERMAN IN THE BLUE GUERNSEY WAS IN THE BOAT WHICH WAS A STOUT-BUILT CRAFT IN HER WAY
HE STOPPED AT THE GATE OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE
THERE IS VERY LITTLE LOVE BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME
YES AND SHE IS SLEEPING VERY CALMLY
BUT THERE ARE SOME NATURES THAT IT SEEMS VERY DIFFICULT TO SPOIL
HENRY DUNBAR WAS A JEALOUS MAN AND HE GRUDGED THE LOVE WHICH HIS WIFE BORE TO HIS DEAD RIVAL'S CHILD
I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU MR LOVELL SHE SAID
MR CARTER WHISTLED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT ALONG WITH THE BASKET ON HIS ARM
YOU'LL SEND ME THE LUNCH YES
WHAT IS THERE TO HINDER HIS ESCAPE EVERYTHING ANSWERED ARTHUR LOVELL WARMLY
A SICKLY BEDMAKER HAD BEEN PENSIONED FOR LIFE BY HIM
BUT SHE COULD NOT
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE HAD PICKED UP HIS EDUCATION BUT HE CERTAINLY HAD CONTRIVED TO EDUCATE HIMSELF SOME HOW OR OTHER I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE FRIENDLY TOGETHER AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH
AND TOM WOULD TELL ME THIS AND DICK WOULD EXPLAIN THAT AND HARRY WOULD REMEMBER THE OTHER
IF HIS OWN GUILTY CONSCIENCE CAN SUFFER HIM TO FORGET IT SHALL BE MY TASK TO RECALL THE PAST
BUT EVEN THEN HE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH HIS WORK OF DESTRUCTION FOR HE STAMPED UPON THE TINY FRAGMENTS UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT OF THE PICTURE BUT A HANDFUL OF SPARKLING DUST
ALL I WANT IS A LITTLE HELP FROM YOU
YES I SEE YOU DO--THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE
THE ANGLO-INDIAN SAT IN HIS PRIVATE SITTING-ROOM AT THE GEORGE HOTEL WRITING AND EXAMINING HIS PAPERS--PERPETUALLY WRITING PERPETUALLY SORTING AND RE-SORTING THOSE PACKETS OF LETTERS IN THE DESPATCH-BOX--WHILE HE WAITED FOR THE COMING OF MR BALDERBY
I CAN'T DOUBT THAT HE'S DEAD
ALMOST EVERY ONE ON THE COURSE KNEW THAT CREST OF AN ARMED HAND CLASPING A BATTLE-AXE AND KNEW THAT IT BELONGED TO HENRY DUNBAR
AND THE FIRE HAS BEEN REPLENISHED THREE TIMES SINCE THE CLOTH WAS LAID FOR DINNER
I'LL TALK TO YOU BY-AND-BY THE MAJOR OBEYED HIS FRIEND
SHE HAD SPOKEN THE DEATH-KNELL OF HIS DEAREST HOPES
ROUND HIS NECK BE THE WEATHER EVER SO SULTRY HE WORE A COMFORTER OF RUSTY WORSTED THAT HAD ONCE BEEN SCARLET AND ABOVE THIS COMFORTER APPEARED HIS NOSE WHICH WAS A PROMINENT AQUILINE
THEY KNOW THAT THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED WAS HENRY DUNBAR--THEY WILL BE HERE--LET ME THINK--LET ME THINK HOW I CAN GET AWAY HE CLASPED BOTH HIS HANDS UPON HIS HEAD AS IF BY FORCE OF THEIR IRON GRIP HE COULD STEADY HIS MIND AND CLEAR AWAY THE CONFUSION OF HIS BRAIN
THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN FAINT-HEARTED
I'LL GO AND ASK LIEF TO TAKE YOU ROUND TO THE MAGISTRATE'S
ONE OF THE SUPERB FOOTMEN THE BIRDS OF PARADISE WHO CONSENTED TO GLORIFY THE HALLS AND PASSAGES OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY APPEARED IN ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS AND WENT IN SEARCH OF MR DUNBAR'S OWN MAN--THE MAN WHO HAD WAITED ON THE INVALID EVER SINCE THE ACCIDENT
SHE HAD INHERITED HER MOTHER'S NATURE ALSO
HE GOT UP EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND BEFORE BREAKFASTING HE DESPATCHED A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE TO THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
THE GIRL OPENED THE DOOR OF AN IMPOSSIBLE-LOOKING LITTLE CUPBOARD IN A CORNER BEHIND A FOUR-POST BED
GOING AWAY
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEATRES OPEN AND THERE WAS A CONCERT AT ONE OF THE OPERA-HOUSES LAST NIGHT
THE GIFT I MEAN TO PRESENT TO YOU WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO PREPARE
YOU CAN GUESS THE SECRET CAN'T YOU MADGE
NO GREEN TREES AND VERMILION DRAPERIES AND CHOCOLATE-COLOURED STREAKS ACROSS AN ULTRAMARINE BACKGROUND SIR
I COULD POINT IT OUT PERHAPS IF I WERE TAKEN THERE WHAT TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN YOUR LEAVING THE CATHEDRAL YARD WITH THE DECEASED AND YOUR RETURNING TO IT WITHOUT HIM PERHAPS HALF AN HOUR NOT LONGER NO
AND OTHER GROUPS STRAGGLED ON THE SEEMED AS IF EVERY LIVING CREATURE IN WINCHESTER WAS TALKING OF THE MURDER THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE GROVE NEAR ST CROSS
I SHALL WAIT FOR MY FRIEND HOWEVER LONG HE MAY BE
THE EVIDENCE OF THE WAITER AND THE LANDLORD OF THE GEORGE ONLY WENT TO SHOW THAT THE TWO MEN HAD ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL TOGETHER
I VERY MUCH DOUBT THE DISCOVERY OF THE GUILTY MAN HE SAID
READY FOR ANYTHING NO FLINCHING NO QUAILING OR TREMBLING WHEN THE DANGER COMES
I STOOD STARING BLANKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROAD FOR SOME TIME AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE PARLOUR WHERE MY MOTHER WITH PARDONABLE WEAKNESS HAD POUNCED UPON THE PACKET AND WAS EXAMINING IT WITH EYES OPENED TO THEIR WIDEST EXTENT
IT WAS PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK WHEN HE HAD STITCHED BOTH SIDES AND ONE END OF THE DOUBLE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS MANNER THAT REPELLED RATHER THAN INVITED FRIENDSHIP
AH
AH
AH
AH
I CAN SEE IT ALL IN HIS FACE HE ADVANCED AS HENRY DUNBAR LANDED AND APPROACHED THE ANGLO-INDIAN
YES SIR IF HE WAS A CHIMNEY-SWEEP WHEN HE WENT INTO YOUR STUDIO HE WENT OUT OF IT A GENTLEMAN THE OLD MAN WOULD HAVE GONE ON TALKING FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FOR PRE-RAPHAELITISM WAS HIS FAVOURITE ANTIPATHY
ARE YOU--ANY--RELATION TO THIS GENTLEMAN THE DOCTOR ASKED HESITATINGLY
CERTAINLY IF THE REINDEER HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT IT WAS TOO CLEAN
I HAD REASON TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS OR HAD BEEN IN ENGLAND FOR SHE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE INTRUSTED THE DIAMONDS TO STRANGE HANDS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOOK EM OVER HERE THEN SAID THE LOCAL CONSTABLE WITH AN AIR OF DISAPPOINTMENT
MARGARET OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT INTO THE ROOM NEXT THE HALL
DON'T COME NEAR ME HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO HER TO CLASP HER IN HIS ARMS AND COMFORT HER WITH SOOTHING TENDER WORDS
THAT'S THE BEST THING I EVER DID HE SAID THE VERY BEST THING I EVER DID
BUT THE GIRL WOULD REVEAL NOTHING
THE HONEST COUNTRY PEOPLE HURRAH FOR THE MASTER OF JOCELYN'S ROCK
OF COURSE I ATTRIBUTED THIS FEELING TO ITS RIGHT CAUSE WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE OVER-EXCITED STATE OF MY OWN BRAIN
IT IS BY THE ELECTRA THAT MR DUNBAR IS TO ARRIVE
HE RANG A BELL AND WAS ADMITTED IMMEDIATELY BY A VERY SHARP-LOOKING BOY WHO USHERED HIM INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE HA SAW A MAHOGANY COUNTER A PAIR OF SMALL BRASS SCALES A HORSE-HAIR-CUSHIONED OFFICE-STOOL CONSIDERABLY THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND A COUPLE OF VERY FORMIDABLE-LOOKING IRON SAFES DEEPLY IMBEDDED IN THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER
I WILL TELL YOU WHY MR AUSTIN
THE FOOLISH CREATURES ARE CARRIED AWAY BY NOISE AND CLAMOUR AND MOST BELIEVE HIM WHO PROTESTS THE LOUDEST
A MONTH PASSED VERY QUIETLY AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR TOOTHACHE I EXPECT
OUR PROFESSION'S A CONSERVATIVE ONE AND A TRAITOR WOULD HAVE AN UNCOMMON GOOD CHANCE OF BEING KICKED OUT OF IT
BUT WE MUST DO OUR BEST
SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO SUIT MY IDEAS OF PERFECTION ANY MORE THAN THE OTHER LADIES I HAD SEEN
BUT IT WAS NOT TO SAY THIS ALONE THAT I CAME HERE TO-NIGHT MARGARET
LET HIM CONSIDER IT A LUCKY ESCAPE IF WHEN WE NEXT MEET HE GETS OFF SCOT FREE SAMPSON WILMOT HAD PRAYED NIGHT AND DAY THAT SUCH A MEETING MIGHT NEVER TAKE PLACE
THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO LIVE--TO LIVE AS LABOURING MEN LIVE IN SOME HOVEL OR OTHER
I'VE LOCKED THE CLOTHES SAFELY IN THAT HE SAID
WHICH I WAS THAT TOOK ABACK LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER SAID THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR AS SHE WENT OUT OF THE RUSTIC PORCH TO OPEN THE GATE FOR MR CARTER AND HIS COMPANION
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING BUT MY OWN WRONGS
MY COMING WILL ATTRACT LESS NOTICE
THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRIME IN A POORER MAN WAS ONLY CONSIDERED AN ERROR IN THE DASHING YOUNG CORNET OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD LOST MONEY UPON THE TURF AND WAS FAIN TO FORGE HIS FRIEND'S SIGNATURE RATHER THAN BECOME A DEFAULTER
CAN I SEND IT ANY WHERE FOR YOU NO THANK YOU
WHAT WAS IT TO ME THAT THIS HAZEL-EYED GIRL WAS ENGAGED TO TEACH MY LITTLE NIECE NON PIU MESTA
BETTY ROARED THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE AS THE GIRL REACHED THE FOOT OF THE STAIR WITH THE DETECTIVE
I HOPE THAT SHE WILL BE HAPPY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE
BUT STEPHEN VALLANCE STRUCK DOWN THAT UPLIFTED HAND WITH A HEAVY BLOW OF HIS FIST AND WRESTING HIMSELF FROM THE DETECTIVE'S GRASP RUSHED UP THE CABIN-STAIRS
MR CRICKLEWOOD THE SURGEON'S IN THE HALL BELOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
I SHALL FIND HER UP-STAIRS WITH MY MOTHER HE WENT UP TO THE LARGE ROOM WITH THE BOW-WINDOW
THESE THREE MEN WERE MR BALDERBY A CONFIDENTIAL CASHIER CALLED CLEMENT AUSTIN AND AN OLD CLERK A MAN OF ABOUT SIXTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD BEEN A FAITHFUL SERVANT OF THE FIRM EVER SINCE HIS BOYHOOD
SHE ONLY KNEW THAT HER FATHER HAD CALLED DOWN HEAVEN'S BLESSING UPON HER
PAID ME A THIRD OF THE MONEY AT THE FIRST SITTING
YOU KNOW HOW ENTIRELY MY HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON YOURS
AND I WON'T THROW MY CHANCE AWAY HE TOOK UP HIS HAT--A BATTERED SHABBY-LOOKING WHITE HAT WHICH HARMONIZED WELL WITH HIS VAGABOND APPEARANCE--AND WENT OUT AFTER STOPPING FOR A MINUTE AT THE BAR TO TELL THE LANDLORD THAT HE WOULD BE BACK IN AN HOUR'S TIME
NOW WHY DO I SAY THIS TO YOU MR AUSTIN
SHE HAD PUSHED HER THICK BLACK VEIL AWAY FROM HER FACE AND THOUGH NO VESTIGE OF HEALTHY COLOUR HAD COME BACK TO HER CHEEKS OR LIPS HER FEATURES HAD A SET LOOK OF STEADFAST RESOLUTION AND HER EYES LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER LIKE THE EYES OF A PERSON WHO HAS ONE SPECIAL PURPOSE IN VIEW AND WILL NOT SWERVE OR FALTER UNTIL THAT PURPOSE HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT
THE BANKER HAD DISMISSED HIS SERVANTS AT TEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT
I LOST NO TIME IN FULFILLING THE COMMISSION INTRUSTED TO ME I WENT DOWN TO SHORNCLIFFE AND DELIVERED THE BOX OF DIAMONDS INTO THE HANDS OF JOHN LOVELL THE SOLICITOR
AND THAT HE IS GOING TO GIVE HIS DAUGHTER LADY JOCELYN A SET OF JEWELS SUCH AS THE QUEEN UPON HER THRONE NEVER SET EYES ON
SHE DID NOT ONCE LOOK BACK AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY--THAT STATELY AND SPLENDID MANSION IN WHICH A MISERABLE WRETCH HAD ACTED HIS PART AND ENDURED THE PENALTY OF HIS GUILT FOR MANY WEARISOME MONTHS SHE WENT AWAY--HURRYING ALONG THE LONELY PATHWAYS WITH THE NIGHT BREEZES BLOWING HER LOOSE HAIR ACROSS HER EYES AND HALF-BLINDING HER AS SHE WENT--TO FIND THE GATE BY WHICH SHE HAD ENTERED THE PARK
LAURA DUNBAR'S DISAPPOINTMENT XX
I AM GOING TO CARVE MY WAY TO FAME AND FORTUNE FOR FAME AND FORTUNE ARE SLAVES THAT COME AT THE BRAVE MAN'S BIDDING
HE DID NOT GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE CLARENDON BUT PIERCED HIS WAY ACROSS SMITHFIELD AND INTO A BUSY SMOKY STREET WHERE HE STOPPED BY-AND-BY AT A DINGY-LOOKING CURRIER'S SHOP
HENRY DUNBAR SAT IN HIS OWN ROOM WAITING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE
SHE WANTED PARASOLS AND HAIR-BRUSHES FRILLED AND FURBELOWED MYSTERIES OF MUSLIN AND LACE COPYBOOKS PENHOLDERS AND POMATUM A BACKBOARD AND A PAIR OF GLOVES DRAWING-PENCILS DUMB-BELLS GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS FOR THE ILLUSTRATION OF HER STUDIES AND A HUNDRED OTHER ITEMS WHOSE VERY NAMES ARE AS A STRANGE LANGUAGE TO MY MASCULINE COMPREHENSION
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A USEFUL CAREER AND AN HONOURED NAME
IT WAS A HUNDRED-GUINEA CHRONOMETER A MASTERPIECE OF BENSON'S WORKMANSHIP
I SHOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
SHE SPOKE IN A STRANGE MECHANICAL WAY AS IF THIS HAD BEEN A SET SPEECH WHICH SHE HAD ARRANGED FOR HERSELF
THIS GIRL WHO SEEMED THE VERY INCARNATION OF PURITY AND CANDOUR HAD HER PRICE PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE AND HENRY DUNBAR HAD BOUGHT THE SILENCE OF HIS VICTIM'S DAUGHTER
AND THE FIRST COURSE CONSISTED OF A PAIR OF VERY SMALL SOLES AND A LARGE CRUET-STAND
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
NO
BESIDES HOW COULD PAPA BE ANGRY WITH ME UPON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING HOME MRS MADDEN SHOOK HER HEAD AGAIN EVEN MORE SOLEMNLY THAN BEFORE
YOU MUST NEVER FORGET THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HE WAS WRONGED AND DEEPLY WRONGED BY THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED
CAN YOU STEER SIR ONE OF THE MEN ASKED
AND WHEN A WOMAN'S HEART IS ONCE ALLOWED SCOPE A WOMAN'S BRAINS SHRIVEL UP LIKE SO MUCH TINDER
LAURA AND HER STEP-SISTER LEFT THE ROOM SOON AFTER DINNER
BUT IN ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS NO WORD HINTING AT AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE HAD DROPPED FROM THE LIPS OF PHILIP JOCELYN
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TO REWARD HIS SCRUTINY--ONLY A SUIT OF CLOTHES A COUPLE OF CLEAN SHIRTS AND THE NECESSARIES OF THE CLERK'S SIMPLE TOILET
THE STONE BOTTLE AND THE BASKET WERE SPEEDILY STOWED AWAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AND MR CARTER WAS INVITED TO DESCEND AND TAKE THE SEAT POINTED OUT TO HIM
WHO COULD BE A MORE FITTING BRIDE FOR THE LORD OF JOCELYN'S ROCK THAN QUEENLY LAURA DUNBAR WITH HER SPLENDID DOWER OF WEALTH AND BEAUTY
REMEMBER FATHER WHO IT WAS THAT SAID TO THE GUILTY WOMAN GO AND SIN NO MORE AY MY GIRL JAMES WENTWORTH ANSWERED BITTERLY BUT THE WORLD WOULD HAVE SAID HENCE ABANDONED CREATURE
BECAUSE YOU SEE SIR HE HAD THE LOOK OF A GENTLEMAN THE MAN ANSWERED
SHE HAD SEEN SICK COTTAGERS AND ORPHAN CHILDREN AND DESOLATE WIDOWS IN HER PILGRIMAGES AMONGST THE DWELLINGS OF THE POOR
IF EVER THE DAY COMES WHEN I AM ABLE TO EXPLAIN MY CONDUCT I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND SAY TO ME CLEMENT AUSTIN YOU ONLY DID YOUR DUTY CLEMENT SAID MR BALDERBY YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT FELLOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM WAS DARK AND HEAVY
AND INDEED THE FIRST STEP NECESSARY WOULD BE A JOURNEY TO SHORNCLIFFE IN WARWICKSHIRE
BUT NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE LIVED OR WHAT HE WAS
HE TOOK THE RUDDER WHEN THEY HAD PUSHED OUT INTO THE OPEN WATER THE TWO YOUNG MEN DIPPED THEIR OARS AND AWAY THE BOAT SHOT OUT TOWARDS THAT SEAWARD HORIZON ON WHICH ONLY THE KEENEST EYES COULD DISCOVER THE BLACK SPECK THAT REPRESENTED THE CROW
HE WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE BANKER AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING OF COURSE THE BARONET THOUGHT AS HE SAT BY THE FIRE IN THE OAK-PANELLED BREAKFAST-ROOM AT THE ROCK PULLING HIS THICK MOUSTACHES REFLECTIVELY AND STARING AT THE RED EMBERS ON THE OPEN HEARTH
FOR SOME MINUTES CLEMENT AUSTIN LINGERED IN THE PORCH AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY UTTERLY AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT
SO THE BROUGHAM TURNED INTO FARRINGDON STREET AND WENT UP SNOW HILL AND UNDER THE GRIM BLACK WALLS OF DREADFUL NEWGATE
AND THE TWO MEN STANDING AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HEARD A HOARSE MURMUR
THAT'S VERY STRANGE
I'VE A TWO-PAIR BACK IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ST MARTIN'S LANE AND I'M KNOWN THERE AS MR VAVASOR
IN THE MEANTIME YOU MAY SIT HERE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE AND HAVE WHAT YOU PLEASE TO EAT OR DRINK WELL I DON'T MIND THE WING OF A FOWL AND A BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY
SO AS THE BLACK-LOOKING SCHOONER VEERED ROUND THE LITTLE BOAT SHOT OUT INTO THE OPEN WATER AND THE TWO YOUNG OARSMEN GREETED THE CAPTAIN'S MANOEUVRE WITH A RINGING PEAL OF LAUGHTER
TELL HER THAT I SHALL ALWAYS REFUSE TO SEE HER WHENEVER OR WHEREVER SHE MAKES AN ATTACK UPON ME
I MIGHT TRY MY HAND AT THAT IF HE STOPPED AND SMILED WITH A STRANGE DELIBERATE EXPRESSION NOT QUITE AGREEABLE TO BEHOLD--"IF I WASN'T GOING TO MEET HENRY DUNBAR THERE WAS A FULL-LENGTH LOOKING-GLASS IN ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP
MY FATHER EXPECTED MY RETURN A WEEK AGO
THE SQUARE CHURCH-TOWER WAS HALF HIDDEN BY THE SHELTERING IVY
SO FOR TWO HOURS MR CARTER WAS FREE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
I WISH SOMEBODY WHOM I CAN RELY UPON TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF THIS BUSINESS AND I THINK WE MAY RELY UPON YOU YES GENTLEMEN I ANSWERED YOU MAY TRUST ME WHAT'S THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MR HENRY DUNBAR ASKED PRETENDING TO LOOK INNOCENT AND SURPRISED
HE HADN'T NEED HAVE DONE SO FOR HE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME YOUNG ENOUGH YOUNG ENOUGH MURMURED MR BALDERBY COMPASSIONATELY
A DEAL IT MATTERS TO SUCH AS YOU MISS LAURA IF ALL THE CATS AND DOGS AS EVER WAS COME DOWN OUT OF THE HEAVENS THIS BLESSED DAY BUT THOUGH HONEST-HEARTED ELIZABETH MADDEN DID HER BEST TO COMFORT HER YOUNG MISTRESS AFTER HER OWN SIMPLE FASHION SHE WAS NOT HERSELF ALTOGETHER SATISFIED
MY PROCLIVITIES ARE ENTIRELY ARISTOCRATIC
FOR THE LAST THREE NIGHTS I HAVE NOT SLEPT AT ALL
HE HAD VERY LITTLE
OF COURSE I MUST REMAIN HERE TO BE PRESENT AT MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING PHILIP JOCELYN WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO RECEIVE THIS PERMISSION TO HURRY THE DAY OF THE CEREMONIAL
NOT JOSEPH WILMOT NO MORE THAN YOU ARE MY PIPPIN ANSWERED THE TRAVELLER INSOLENTLY
FOR I HAVE SEEN MY FATHER LOOK AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF ABSOLUTE HORROR IN HIS STERN CRUEL EYES
HE LIFTED THE LAMP SUDDENLY STILL LOOKING IN THE TRAVELLER'S FACE STILL MUTTERING IN THE SAME HALF-ABSENT TONE NOT JOSEPH WILMOT AND BROUGHT THE LIGHT ON A LEVEL WITH THE OTHER MAN'S EYES
HENRY DUNBAR IS A RESOLUTE MAN
WE FOLLOWED THIS PATHWAY AND WALKED TO THE VERY PLACE IN WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD BEEN FOUND
YOU MAY CALL ME ANYTHING
LOOK BACK AT ALL THOSE HAPPY DAYS AND GIVE ME ONE WORD MY DARLING--ONE WORD TO TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME LAURA DUNBAR LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A SWEET SMILE AND LAID HER SOFT WHITE HAND IN HIS
HE READ ONE PASSAGE SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
I'D BEEN LOITERIN ABOUT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SIR HE SAID
THE HORSE HE SAID
THIS WAS NOT A PLEASANT THOUGHT AND IT WAS UPPERMOST IN MY MIND WHILE I SAT OPPOSITE TO THE DETECTIVE WHO ATE A VERY HEARTY DINNER AND WHOSE AIR OF SUPPRESSED HIGH SPIRITS WAS INTOLERABLE TO ME
IF I COULD GET AWAY IT WOULD ALL BE DIFFERENT
YOU WISH TO SEE HENRY DUNBAR YES ANSWERED MARGARET THOUGHTFULLY
GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER WITH EVERY MOMENT
WHILE THE SABBATH-BELLS WERE RINGING IN THE FROSTY ATMOSPHERE MAJOR VERNON OPENED THE LOW WHITE GATE OF HIS PLEASANT LITTLE GARDEN AND WENT OUT UPON THE HIGH-ROAD
CLEMENT HAD PERSUADED HIS MOTHER TO MAKE THIS ARRANGEMENT A SETTLED THING
FIRST AND FOREMOST YOU AND ME ARE TWO GENTLEMEN THAT HAVE GOT MORE TIME THAN WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AND MORE MONEY THAN WE KNOW HOW TO SPEND
BUT LAURA WAS BENT UPON SEEING EVERY PICTURE AND PHILIP JOCELYN WAITED PATIENTLY ENOUGH UNTIL THE INSPECTION SHOULD BE CONCLUDED
SOMETIMES IN HIS DREAMS HE SAW THE FAMILIAR FACE LOOKING AT HIM WITH PENSIVE HALF-REPROACHFUL GLANCES
YES SIR I LOVE MISS DUNBAR AS TRULY AS EVER A MAN LOVED THE WOMAN OF HIS CHOICE
AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT HAD PARALYZED HIM AT THE FIRST TOUCH OF HIS DAUGHTER'S INNOCENT LIPS
THE ASSASSIN HAD BEEN ARMED WITH THE CRUEL ROPE AND HAD CREPT STEALTHILY BEHIND HIS VICTIM
AND MRS AUSTIN HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS
HE WANDERED INTO THE WATER PERHAPS OH NO SIR
THE BANKER WAS GETTING BETTER AND STRONGER EVERY DAY ARTHUR LOVELL SAID
HE WAS FAIN TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH BEING CARRIED TO AN EASY-CHAIR TO SIT FOR A FEW HOURS WRAPPED IN BLANKETS WITH THE LEOPARD-SKIN RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS
DID I
GIVE MISS WENTWORTH A GLASS OF WINE MOTHER EXCLAIMED CLEMENT AUSTIN
HE COULD ONLY BOW HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AWFUL NECESSITY THAT URGED HIM ON TO TAKE HIS PART IN THIS DRAMA OF CRIME--THE PART OF AN AVENGER
MARGARET'S FATHER
WHILE THE BANKER LOITERED NEAR THE WINDOW CLEMENT AUSTIN CAME INTO THE ROOM TO SHOW SOME DOCUMENT TO THE JUNIOR PARTNER
THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN STRIPPED FROM HIM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS TROUSERS AND BOOTS AND THE OTHER PART OF HIS BODY WAS BARE
IF BY A STRANGE FATALITY I WHO SO DEARLY LOVED THIS GIRL HAD URGED ON THE COMING OF THIS FATAL DAY I HAD ONLY BEEN A BLIND INSTRUMENT IN THE MIGHTY HAND OF PROVIDENCE AND I HAD NO CAUSE TO REGRET THE REVELATION OF THE TRUTH
BUT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE VERY LONELY AT HOME WITHOUT YOU
SO LONG AS I HAD BELIEVED IN HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT I HAD FELT NO COMPUNCTION AS TO THE TASK I WAS ENGAGED IN
YES I REPLIED OF COURSE IF I FOUND THE MUSIC IN ANY WAY A NUISANCE COMING HOME FROM THE CITY THE NEXT DAY I FELT LIKE A SCHOOLBOY WHO TURNS HIS BACK UPON ALL THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE ON SOME SUNNY SUMMER HOLIDAY
AN OUT-AND-OUT GENTLEMAN
HENRY DUNBAR TOLD THE STORY OF THE MURDER
FOR ALTHOUGH THE PAPERS HAD BEEN NEATLY ARRANGED BEFORE HE RE-SORTED EVERY ONE OF THEM
OH YES HE SAID I'VE MONEY ENOUGH--I AM ALL RIGHT BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHE ASKED EAGERLY
I'LL MAKE INQUIRIES AT THE GATE UPON THE LISFORD ROAD HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HE TOOK A FEW SPOONFULS OF SOUP HE ATE TWO OR THREE MOUTHFULS OF FISH AND THEN PUSHED AWAY HIS PLATE
HIS HEART WAS DEAD
THE YOUNG LAWYER DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND SAT FOR SOME MINUTES SILENTLY PORING OVER THE CLERK'S LETTER
BUT HERE IN THE HANDWRITING OF THE DEAD CLERK HERE WAS THE EVIDENCE OF THAT OLD STORY
YOU DO NOT LOVE ME NO
HE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER TELLING AN AGRICULTURAL LABOURER OF THE QUEER FARMING HE HAD SEEN ABROAD
FOR IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF A MOMENT IN WHICH THE VICTIM'S FIRST CRY OF SURPRISE WAS STIFLED ERE IT WAS HALF UTTERED
IT WAS NOT ONE THING BUT MANY THINGS THAT HINTED AT THE GUILT OF THE MILLIONAIRE
BUT THE DARKNESS OF THE MYSTERY SEEMED IMPENETRABLE AND LITTLE BY LITTLE PEOPLE LEFT OFF TALKING OF THE MURDER
THE BROAD SUNLIGHT STREAMED IN UPON THE SOMBRE COLOURS OF THE TURKEY CARPET THE SOUND OF WHEELS WAS IN THE STREET BELOW WHEN THE BANKER'S WORK WAS FINISHED
I'VE HAD A TOUCH OF DELIRIUM TREMENS AND MY NERVES ARE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY USED TO BE
INSIDE THE COAT THERE WAS A WAISTCOAT A SATIN SCARF THAT WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A PULP AND A SHIRT THAT HAD ONCE BEEN WHITE
SURELY IT WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE NOW
I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES--THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
THERE WAS A YOUNG PUSSON WITH MR DUNBAR ABOVE A HOUR AGO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN ABOVE AN HOUR AGO CRIED CLEMENT AUSTIN HEEDLESS OF THE MAN'S IMPERTINENCE IN HIS OWN GROWING ANXIETY
YOU'VE STOOD A GOOD DEAL AND STOOD IT NOBLY
MY POOR GIRL--MY POOR BRAVE GIRL
HE LOVED THIS GIRL WHO BY REASON OF HER FATHER'S WEALTH WAS AS FAR REMOVED FROM HIM AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A DUCHESS
WHY OF COURSE HE WOULD PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT LAURA WISHED IT
IS THERE NO OTHER PLACE IN WHICH I CAN SLEEP HE ASKED
SO FAR HE HAD KEPT HIS PROMISE
AND THAT HE HAD SINCE DIED
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO THINK SO MUCH OF THIS--AHEM--PERSON HE HAD HESITATED A LITTLE BEFORE THE LAST WORD
AND IN THE GRAND HOUSE IN THE RUE LEPELLETIER MANY A GLASS WAS TURNED FULL UPON THE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH BRIDE WITH THE CHEVELURE DORE AND THE VIOLET BLUE EYES
IF YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM
HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD BENT AND HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE
JOSEPH WILMOT FILLED THE GLASS WITH BRANDY FOR THE SECOND TIME AND PUT IT TO HIS DAUGHTER'S LIPS
FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO SAID THE PAINTER PULLING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS BEARD
AS FOR WHAT YOU ASK I SHALL DO IT OR I SHALL LET IT ALONE--AS I THINK FIT
FOR HIS STERN AND GLOOMY MANNER WAS SO UNLIKE HIS FATHER'S EASY AFFABLE GOOD-NATURE THAT PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS DRAWING COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE DEAD MAN AND THE LIVING
REMEMBER WHAT SUFFERING YOU ARE INFLICTING UPON ME BY THIS CRUEL SILENCE AT LAST THE HAZEL EYES LOST THEIR FIXED LOOK AND WANDERED FOR A MOMENT TO CLEMENT AUSTIN'S FACE
SURELY THIS WAS THE VERY TRIUMPH OF CRIME A MASTER-STROKE OF VILLANY
LAURA REMEMBERED THIS AND MADE EXCUSES TO HERSELF FOR HER FATHER'S COLDNESS
YET WHAT MORE POSSIBLE THAN THAT THE ANGLO-INDIAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH A MOMENTARY GIDDINESS
I'VE GOT IT HONESTLY MIND YOU
MY GAME IS TO KEEP MYSELF DARK AND GET ALL THE LIGHT I CAN FROM OTHER PEOPLE
HE TOLD HOW THEY HAD GONE BY ARM-IN-ARM LAUGHING AND TALKING TOGETHER
SUPPOSE YOU BRING US A LITTLE STRONG TEA AND CLEAR AWAY THIS DESSERT
SHE CAREFULLY SUPPRESSED ALL VEHEMENT EMOTION
PITY ME AND FORGET ME
I HAVE SAID THAT IT WAS LAURA'S PECULIAR PRIVILEGE TO BEWITCH EVERYBODY WITH WHOM SHE CAME IN CONTACT AND TO TRANSFORM THEM FOR THE NONCE INTO HER WILLING SLAVES EAGER TO GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER IN THE SERVICE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WHOSE EYES AND HAIR WERE LIKE BLUE SKIES AND GOLDEN SUNSHINE AND CARRIED LIGHT AND SUMMER WHEREVER THEY WENT
THUS IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS THAT I DISTINCTLY SAW THE OUTLINE OF HER FIGURE
MR CARTER HAD REVEALED HIMSELF TO THE CONSTABULARY AS ONE OF THE CHIEF LUMINARIES OF SCOTLAND YARD
NOW AS YOU KNOW HIM SAMPSON AND AS YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT MAN OF BUSINESS AND AS ACTIVE AS A BOY I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET HIM
INEVITABLE NO DOUBT LONG AGO
THE PASSENGERS BEGAN TO COME ON SHORE AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MR KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
YOU MUST HAVE PATIENCE AND STILL HOPE FOR THE BEST
OH I SHOULD BE SO VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO EXAMINE THOSE PICTURES SAID LAURA
HEAVEN HAVE PITY UPON HIM AND KEEP HIM FROM SIN MURMURED MARGARET WENTWORTH CLASPING HER HANDS AND WITH HER EYES STILL FOLLOWING THE RETREATING FIGURE
WHEN I AM YEARNING FOR HIS AFFECTION
AND HOWEVER I RECKON IT UP THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT COMES TO
FOR ALTHOUGH HE WAS HANDSOME CLEVER HIGH-SPIRITED AND HONOURABLE A GENTLEMAN IN THE NOBLEST SENSE OF THAT NOBLE WORD HE WAS NO FIT HUSBAND FOR THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY DUNBAR
HE PUSHED ASIDE THE WRITING-MATERIALS AND TOOK HIS PURCHASES OF THE AFTERNOON FROM HIS POCKET
HE MAY COME DOWN UPON US AT ANY MOMENT FOR A VERY STIFF SUM OF MONEY
WHEN HER LOVER WAS ALSO WAITING FOR HER FULL OF ANXIETY TO KNOW THE RESULT OF THE STEP SHE HAD TAKEN
BECAUSE IN HIS CURT MANNERS HIS CLOSELY BUTTONED-UP COAT TIGHTLY-STRAPPED TROUSERS AND HEAVY MOUSTACHE THERE WAS A CERTAIN MILITARY FLAVOUR WHICH HAD GIVEN RISE TO THE RUMOUR THAT THE UNKNOWN HAD IN SOME REMOTE PERIOD BEEN ONE OF THE DEFENDERS OF HIS COUNTRY
IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER LEAVING THE GATE OF MAUDESLEY PARK THE FLY CAME TO A STAND-STILL BEFORE WOODBINE COTTAGE
HAVEN'T YOU ONE WORD TO SAY IN MY BEHALF MR HENRY MADE NO ANSWER
WAIT DEAR MOTHER HE SAID
FOR IN THIS HE WAS AS DIFFICULT TO PLEASE AS HE HAD BEEN IN THE MATTER OF HIS BEARD AND HAIR
FOR THE SECOND TIME SINCE THE MURDER IN THE GROVE NEAR ST CROSS HE HAD BETRAYED VIOLENT AND SUDDEN EMOTION
SHE RESEMBLED HER MOTHER LADY LOUISA DUNBAR THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF GRANTWICK A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND ARISTOCRATIC WOMAN
AND BEFORE A FORTNIGHT HAD PASSED SHE HAD SECURED MORE THAN A DOZEN PUPILS WHO GAVE HER AMPLE EMPLOYMENT FOR HER TIME
GENT IN FURRED COAT TOOK A TICKET THROUGH TO HULL
THE WOMAN TOLD HIM THAT A YOUNG LADY HAD GONE OUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE
BEFORE CROSSING THE RIVER TO DO THIS HE HAD TAKEN STOCK OF THE CROW AND HER MASTER AND HAD SEEN THE CAPTAIN LYING IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE AS BEFORE SMOKING A DIRTY BLACK PIPE IN HIE SLEEP
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
AND HENRY DUNBAR WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE OPEN DESPATCH-BOX SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE TALL WAX-CANDLES
CLEMENT AUSTIN FELT THIS AND YET HE HAD NO HEART TO BEGIN LIFE AGAIN THOUGH TEMPTING OFFERS CAME TO HIM FROM GREAT COMMERCIAL HOUSES WHOSE CHIEFS WERE EAGER TO SECURE THE WELL-KNOWN CASHIER OF MESSRS
WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW MAJOR VERNON AS A FRIEND OF THE MISSING GENTLEMAN EH THE MAJOR SMILED
AND TO IMPATIENCE HAD SUCCEEDED A VAGUE SENSE OF ALARM
ALL RIGHT UP TO DERBY WROTE SAWNEY TOM
OR TO THINK OF HER FOR THE MATTER OF THAT HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER
HIS CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN MUCH IMPAIRED HE SAID BY HIS LONG RESIDENCE IN CALCUTTA
YOU MIGHTN'T CARE TO GO TO THAT PRICE HE REPEATED AS HE HELPED HIMSELF TO ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF A POUND OF COLD HAM
HE PREFERRED TO TAKE THAT PLEASANT BRIDLE-PATH THROUGH MAUDESLEY PARK THAT DELICIOUS GRASSY ARCADE WHERE THE OVERARCHING BRANCHES OF THE OLD ELMS MADE A SHADOWY TWILIGHT ONLY BROKEN NOW AND THEN BY SUDDEN PATCHES OF YELLOW SUNSHINE
HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOT ALONE
SHE HAD LOVED HIM FOR THOSE FEEBLE TRACES OF A BETTER NATURE THAT HAD BEEN DIMLY VISIBLE IN HIS CHARACTER
CHAPTER XXXVII
STOP ME IN GOING ABROAD TO IMPROVE MY MIND AND MANNERS BY FOREIGN TRAVEL DO MR DETECTIVE
NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD THE NAME OF THIS MAN
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF MY GENTLEMAN'S GONE AND HIDDEN HIMSELF DOWN BELOW THE HATCHWAY OF THAT BOAT HE THOUGHT AS HE WALKED SLOWLY ALONG THE QUAY-SIDE
BUT I AM PLEASED TO THINK THAT IN SPITE OF THE COLDNESS OF HIS MANNER MY FATHER HAD SOME AFFECTION FOR HIS ONLY CHILD MR CARTER WAS NOT LOOKING AT LAURA HE WAS STARING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND HIS EYES HAD THAT STOLID GLARE WITH WHICH THEY HAD GAZED AT CLEMENT AUSTIN WHILE THE CASHIER TOLD HIS STORY
AND THE DEAR JINGLING DILIGENCES WITH VERY LITTLE HARNESS TO SPEAK OF BUT ANY QUANTITY OF OLD ROPE
BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOUR THAT I HAVE A VERY GOOD REASON FOR WHAT I DO VERY WELL THEN I WILL ANSWER YOU FRANKLY SAID LAURA TURNING AND LOOKING MR CARTER FULL IN THE FACE
HENRY DUNBAR DID NOT RETURN HIS PARTNER'S GREETING
IN THAT BRIGHT MOONLIGHT THE SAILS OF THE CROW GREW WHITER AND LARGER WITH EVERY DIP OF THE OARS THAT WERE CARRYING THE PRETTY POLLY SO LIGHTLY OVER THE BLUE WATER
HE BROUGHT A SMALL PORTMANTEAU WITH HIM AND THEN DEPARTED TO FETCH A CAB IN WHICH VEHICLE THE TWO GENTLEMEN DROVE AWAY TO THE EUSTON-SQUARE STATION
BUT LATE AS IT WAS MAJOR VERNON PUT ON HIS HAT TURNED HIS POODLE COLLAR UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND WENT OUT INTO LISFORD HIGH STREET
I SHALL EXPECT YOU AT NINE O'CLOCK
HE RELAPSED INTO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS BOOK NOW
YOU ARE YOUNG GOOD-LOOKING CLEVER AGREEABLE
I SHALL LIVE IN THE HOPE OF IT NOTWITHSTANDING SHE SAID
CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO OFFER YOU MY RESIGNATION HAVE YOU QUARRELLED WITH ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE
AT LAST BY DINT OF GOING OVER THE GROUND AGAIN AND AGAIN ALWAYS PLEADING MARGARET'S CAUSE AGAINST THE STERN WITNESS OF CRUEL FACTS CLEMENT CAME TO LOOK UPON THE GIRL'S INNOCENCE AS A SETTLED THING
FOR EVERY SORROWFUL THOUGHT WHICH WANDERS TO THE LOVED AND LOST IS A SEPARATE TREASON AGAINST THE HOUSE HE SERVES
A SPLENDID PLACE WHAT AM I TO CALL YOU HERE MUTTERED MR DUNBAR AS HE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE
AT ONE O'CLOCK ON THE APPOINTED THURSDAY MORNING MR DUNBAR PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE DIAMOND-MERCHANT'S OFFICE
HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE WAS GOING MAD
THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE OCCUPANT WERE MUFFLED BY THE RICH THICKNESS OF THE SOMBRE TURKEY CARPET
I DON'T WISH IT TO BE REMOVED HE FAINTED AWAY PRESENTLY FOR HIS LEG WAS VERY PAINFUL
HER FROCKS WERE TOO SHORT HER BOOTS WERE TOO SMALL HER BONNETS TUMBLED OFF HER HEAD AND HUNG FORLORNLY AT THE BACK OF HER NECK
AND STEPHEN VALLANCE ALIAS BLACKGUARD STEEVE ALIAS MAJOR VERNON HAD GONE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA NEVER IN THIS MORTAL LIFE TO RISE AGAIN
YOU SEEMED VERY MUCH AGITATED BY THE NEWS OF THAT SHOCKING MURDER AT WINCHESTER
HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A FIT OF AWKWARDNESS THAT DAY YOU THINK THAT HE WAS GUILTY AND THAT HE WAS CONFUSED AND AGITATED BY THE HIDEOUS BUSINESS HE HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN MR CARTER LOOKED AT ME WITH A VERY QUEER SMILE ON HIS FACE
HOWEVER THE CAPITAL IS YOURS MR DUNBAR
THE GOOD CREATURE FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLD WET CHEERLESS MORNING QUITE AS KEENLY AS HER MISTRESS
IT'S NOT UNPLEASANT FOR YOU I HOPE CLEMENT IT ISN'T PLEASANT FOR ANY ONE WHO IS CONCERNED IN IT MOTHER ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THOUGHTFULLY
AND THE FOOT VISIBLE BELOW THE SCANTY SKIRT WAS SLIM AND ARCHED AS THE FOOT OF AN ARAB CHIEF
SHE WAS SITTING IN THE SAME LOW LUXURIOUS EASY-CHAIR WITH THE HOT-HOUSE FLOWERS BEHIND HER AND A HUGE NEWFOUNDLAND DOG--A FAITHFUL ATTENDANT THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY--LYING AT HER FEET
SUCH AN OVERPOWERING SENSE OF JOY WAS IN MY HEART THAT I COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE IT WAS WINTER AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THE FADING NOVEMBER SUNSHINE THAT LIT UP THE SKY
BUT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF KEEPING ANY VEIL OVER THE SACRED MYSTERIES OF MY HEART
HE LOOKED SHARPLY UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
WHOSE TREACHERY MADE YOU WHAT YOU ARE
AND HENRY THEN GETTING ON FOR FORTY YEARS OF AGE HAD FALLEN DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIDOW
THE TRADESMAN AND HIS SHOPBOY STARED AGHAST
I BEGAN BUSINESS BY ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY LADY IN KYLMINGTON WHO GAVE LESSONS IN MUSIC AND SINGING
PERHAPS THEY TOOK HIM FOR SOME MODERN GNOME DANCING WILD DANCES IN THE WET WOODLAND
HAVE YOU ANY OBJECTION TO DO THIS NO SIR ANSWERED THE CLERK
THERE MUST BE SOME HOPELESS ENTANGLEMENT SOME CRUEL INVOLVEMENT BY REASON OF WHICH MARGARET IS COMPELLED TO FALSIFY HER NATURE AND SACRIFICE HER OWN HAPPINESS AS WELL AS MINE
AT LAST HOWEVER THE CREAKING FOOTSTEP OF THE MEDICAL MAN SOUNDED IN THE CORRIDOR
THE CONSTABLE WATCHED HIM WITH OPEN EYES BUT WITH NO RAY OF INTELLIGENCE IN HIS STOLID FACE
BUT EVEN SHE WAS BEGINNING TO BE UNEASY AT THE ABSENCE OF HOT SON'S BETROTHED WIFE
SHE HAD SHARED HER GLOOMY SECRET WITH NEITHER FRIENDS NOR COUNSELLORS AND HAD BORNE HER DISMAL BURDEN ALONE
IT SEEMS AS IF THEY FEARED TO HANDLE THE CASE TO CLOSELY LEST THE CLUE THEY FOLLOWED SHOULD LEAD THEM TO HENRY DUNBAR YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN BRIBED NO
AND HAD THEIR FUTURE LIVES REVEALED TO THEM BY A THEATRICAL-LOOKING GIPSY IMPORTED FROM LONDON FOR THE OCCASION WHOSE ARCH PROPHECIES BROUGHT LOVELY BLUSHES INTO LAURA'S CHEEKS AND AFFORDED PHILIP AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ADMIRING THE EFFECT OF DARK-BROWN EYELASHES DROOPING OVER DARK-BLUE EYES
WERE YOU UPON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE DECEASED I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU SO
HERE HE WAS TAKEN TO A BED-CHAMBER WHOSE OLD-FASHIONED LATTICED WINDOWS LOOKED OUT UPON THE DUSTY ROAD
AND IF HE'S KNAVE ENOUGH TO PLAY THEM AGAINST ME----BUT I DON'T THINK HE'LL DO THAT
A BLEAK WIND WAS BLOWING DOWN FROM THE HILLS AND THE ROOKS NESTS HIGH UP IN THE BRANCHES OF THE OLD TREES ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL WERE ROCKING LIKE THAT LEGENDARY CRADLE IN THE TREE-TOP
CLEMENT'S STORY.--BEFORE THE DAWN
HENRY DUNBAR WAS RESOLUTE
I WENT OUT MYSELF TO POST THE LETTER AND I WAS GLAD TO FEEL THE COOL BREEZE BLOWING THE HAIR AWAY FROM MY FOREHEAD FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY HAD GIVEN ME A NERVOUS HEADACHE
HE THOUGHT OF HIS OLD MASTER AS HE KNEW HIM FIRST AND HIS HEART WAS SOFTENED TOWARDS THE DEAD MAN'S MEMORY
NOR WAS THIS ALL--UNUTTERABLE TERROR TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF A MEETING BETWEEN JOSEPH WILMOT AND HENRY DUNBAR
AND ILL AND BROKEN DOWN BY HER SORROWS SHE LINGERED IN CALCUTTA SUBSISTING UPON HER PENSION AND TOO WEAK TO UNDERTAKE THE PERILS OF THE VOYAGE HOME
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THAT HE NEED LOOK UPON AS BEYOND HIM
HIS TREMULOUS HANDS COULD SCARCELY ADJUST HIS SPECTACLES
I COULD NOT ENDURE THAT
THE INCOME WHICH MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR SET ASIDE FOR HIS OWN USE WAS SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR
AND FOR YOUR SAKE
I HAVE BEEN IN INDIA FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS HE SAID
THE LOVER THOUGHT THAT ONE LOOK MORE PRECIOUS THAN JOCELYN'S ROCK AND A BARONETCY THAT DATED FROM THE DAYS OF ENGLAND'S FIRST STUARTS--THAT ONE GLORIOUS SMILE WHICH MELTED AWAY IN A MOMENT AND GAVE PLACE TO BRIGHT MAIDENLY BLUSHES FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE DEWY HEART OF AN OLD-FASHIONED CABBAGE-ROSE GATHERED AT SUNRISE
AND NOW HE WAS EAGER TO GIVE HER HAND TO THE FIRST SUITOR WHO PRESENTED HIMSELF
THE QUEER OUTLANDISH WORDS WERE HINDOSTANEE NO DOUBT AND WERE BY NO MEANS EASY TO COMPREHEND
I WILL DESCRIBE HER BECAUSE IT IS SWEET TO ME TO DWELL UPON HER IMAGE AND TO TRANSLATE THAT DEAR IMAGE NO MATTER HOW POORLY INTO WORDS
AS THE MILITARY SWELLS DO WHEN THEY WANT TO GET RID OF A PAL THERE WERE PLENTY OF REFRESHMENTS TO BE HAD AT DERBY AND MR CARTER TOOK A STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE AND A FORMIDABLE-LOOKING PILE OF SANDWICHES BEFORE RETIRING TO THE WAITING-ROOM TO TAKE WHAT HE CALLED A STRETCH HE THEN ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF A PORTER WHO WAS TO CALL HIM FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE STARTING OF THE NORMANTON TRAIN AND WAS TO RECEIVE AN ILLEGAL DOUCEUR FOR THAT CIVILITY
THE CRIMSON CURTAINS WERE NOT YET DRAWN ACROSS THE DIAMOND-PANED WINDOW
HE WAS CHEWING NOTHING WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY ENERGY
THAT WILL DO FOR THE PRESENT SAID THE CORONER
THE LAWS OF SOCIETY ARE INFLEXIBLE MADGE
WHERE'S MY YOUNG LADY'S TRUSSAW TO BE GOT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
LAURA DUNBAR
JUST IN TIME TO CATCH THE MAIL FROM RUGBY
THERE WAS A FULL MOON BUT IT WAS OBSCURED EVERY NOW AND THEN BY THE BLACK CLOUDS THAT DRIFTED ACROSS IT
THE YOUNG LADY IS SUFFERING FROM SOME MENTAL UNEASINESS WHICH SHE REFUSES TO COMMUNICATE TO HER FRIENDS
BUT THE CELLARS BELOW THEIR OFFICES--WONDERFUL CELLARS THAT STRETCHED FAR AWAY UNDERNEATH THE CHURCH OF ST GUNDOLPH AND WERE ONLY SEPARATED BY PARTY-WALLS FROM THE VAULTS IN WHICH THE DEAD LAY BURIED--WERE POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED WITH HOGSHEADS OF SOVEREIGNS BARS OF BULLION BUILT UP IN STACKS LIKE SO MUCH FIREWOOD AND IMPREGNABLE IRON SAFES CRAMMED TO OVERFLOWING WITH BANK BILLS AND RAILWAY SHARES GOVERNMENT SECURITIES FAMILY JEWELS AND A HUNDRED OTHER TRIFLES OF THAT KIND EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS WORTH A POOR MAN'S FORTUNE
AND THEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIS OLD VALET
AND WHATEVER HE DID HE DID OUT OF LOVE FOR HIS MASTER MR HUGH SHOOK HIS HEAD
THERE WAS A FEELING OF OPPRESSION UPON THE MINDS OF THE THREE MEN
A DANGEROUS MAN TO OFFEND
AN OLD MAN WHO REMEMBERS SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE--AY SIR I HAD THE HONOUR TO KNOW HIM INTIMATELY
HIS MEMORY HAS BEEN FAILING A LONG TIME
AFTER EXAMINING HALF-A-DOZEN CUPBOARDS IN THE LOWER REGIONS MR CARTER AND HIS GUIDE ASCENDED TO THE UPPER STORY
TOIL AND STRUGGLE TO REGAIN THE EMINENCE FROM WHICH YOU HAVE FALLEN AND WHEN YOU HAVE NEARLY REACHED THE TOP OF THAT DIFFICULT HILL WE WILL BAND OURSELVES TOGETHER TO HURL YOU BACK INTO THE BLACK ABYSS THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD SAYS TO THE SINNER MARGARET MY GIRL
WHY I THOUGHT HE WAS STILL UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION--COULDN'T MOVE OFF HIS SOFA EXCEPT TO TAKE A TURN UPON A PAIR OF CRUTCHES I BELIEVE IT WAS SO BUT HE HAS DISAPPEARED NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DISAPPEARED
BUT THAT TWO THOU ISN'T MEANT FOR A BLIND IS IT
I WILL GO TO HENRY DUNBAR SHE SAID TO HERSELF SINCE THE LAW WILL NOT HELP ME
WHAT IS IT
DERBY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF DERBY
LIKE A MAN WHO HAS SOME PURPOSE IN HIS MIND YET IS OPPRESSED BY A FEVERISH IRRESOLUTION AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT PURPOSE
W
THE SHABBINESS OF THE LEGISLATURE MUST ANSWER FOR IT IF CRIMINALS REMAIN AT LARGE
BUT THE DETECTIVE WAS NOT UNUSED TO ENCOUNTERS WHERE THE ODDS WERE AGAINST HIM AND HE CONTEMPLATED THE CHANCES OF BEING HURLED OVERBOARD IN A HAND-TO-HAND STRUGGLE WITH JOSEPH WILMOT AS CALMLY AS IF DEATH BY DROWNING WERE THE LEGITIMATE END OF A MAN'S EXISTENCE
I HAVE GUESSED RIGHTLY THEN SAID MR DUNBAR
THE PLEASANT TALK ABOUT NEW BOOKS AND MUSIC
THIS STREET FOR INSTANCE--IT HAS NOT BEEN BUILT SIX YEARS OH YES I REMEMBER
AND THOUGH HIS BROAD CHEST SQUARE SHOULDERS AND LONG MUSCULAR ARMS BETOKENED STRENGTH THAT NATURAL VIGOUR MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPAIRED BY THE EFFECTS OF A WARM CLIMATE
PHILIP JOCELYN LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS RACE WITH A PECULIAR INTEREST FOR IT WAS TO BE THE LAST HE WOULD EVER RIDE--THE VERY LAST
THAT DINNER-PARTY WAS NOT A PLEASANT ONE
I SHUDDERED AT THE RAPID COURSE OF JUSTICE WHEN ONCE A CRIMINAL MYSTERY IS REVEALED
HE KNEW THAT HE WAS CLEVER
I AM SO SORRY OUR MEETING HAS AGITATED YOU LIKE THIS
AND UPON THE BROAD LANDING-PLACE OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT THE BANKER STOPPED SUDDENLY AND LAID HIS HAND UPON THE GILDED BALUSTRADE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HER VERY MUCH MRS AUSTIN AND HER SON WENT INTO THE ADJOINING CHAMBER
LAURA BEGAN TO HOPE AGAIN
A FAINT RUSTLING OF A WOMAN'S DRESS SOUNDED IN MY EARS OR SEEMED SO TO SOUND AS THE FIGURE MELTED FROM MY SIGHT
17S
THE LETTER HAD BEEN STARING ME IN THE FACE ALL THE EVENING BUT IN MY ABSTRACTION I HAD NEVER NOTICED IT
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER AND WISER TO GO AWAY
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING OF THAT SORT HE SAID
DO YOU WANT ME SIR HE ASKED WITH RATHER A SUSPICIOUS GLANCE AT THE REPROBATE'S SHABBY DRESS
OF COURSE THERE HAD BEEN AMPLE TIME FOR THE CAB IN QUESTION TO GET FAR BEYOND REACH OF PURSUIT
I HAVE PUT THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND SEALED IT
MY SISTER MARIAN UNDERLINED THIS LAST CONDITION
NOW MISS HE SAID IF YOU'LL COME ALONG WITH ME I'LL TAKE YOU TO SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE'S HOUSE
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF ANY MAN REMEMBERING AS HE DID HOW HE HAD ONCE TRUSTED HENRY DUNBAR
MARGARET HE SAID IN A LOW EARNEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW DEARLY I HAVE LOVED AND DO LOVE YOU
A CRUEL VOICE BETRAYS HIM
HIS HEALTH WAS ENTIRELY BROKEN AND HE WOULD ASSIST IN NO SPLENDID CEREMONIAL TO WHICH HALF THE COUNTY WOULD BE INVITED
BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT OF A NATION AS INSULTS THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAITS BEHIND HIS EMPLOYER'S CHAIR AT TABLE BY CALLIN HIM A KITTEN-MUNCHER CHAPTER XXVI
IT WAS A COMMON MURDER AFTER ALL
THE BALANCE OF THIS INCOME AND HIS DOUBLE SHARE IN THE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS WENT TO THE CREDIT OF HIS DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND VARIOUS SUMS HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM TIME TO TIME AND DULY INVESTED UNDER HIS ORDER PERHAPS YOU CAN LET ME SEE THE LEDGERS CONTAINING THOSE TWO ACCOUNTS MOST CERTAINLY MR BALDERBY TOUCHED THE SPRING OF A HANDBELL UPON HIS TABLE
IF SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THAT WRETCHED MAN I SHOULD OF COURSE WISH HER TO BE WELL PROVIDED FOR
HE DID NOT SPEAK NOW EVEN WHEN HIS SON APPEALED TO HIM
AND MARGARET WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WAIT UPON HERSELF WHEN SHE CAME HOME AFTER NIGHTFALL
HE'S GOT A BELT STUFFED WITH DIAMONDS ROUND HIS WAIST MR CARTER SAID THIS AT A VENTURE FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHICH OF THE MEN HAD THE DIAMOND BELT
CLEMENT AUSTIN KNEW THIS AND HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM UPWARDS OF TWO HOURS TO GO TO ALL FOUR OF THEM
EVEN UPON THAT LANDING-PLACE THERE WAS NO LACK OF EVIDENCE OF WEALTH
AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING-ROOM SIGHING HEAVILY AS HE WENT
DID HE SING
AND WHEN ONE HAVE TWELVE GRAND-CHILDREN AND A BED-RIDDEN WIFE ONE FINDS IT HARD SIR
OF ALL THE THINGS I EVER THOUGHT OF ARTHUR THIS NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD SHE SAID IN A LOW PENSIVE VOICE AS SHE STOOD ONE EVENING IN THE DEEP EMBRASURE OF THE TUDOR WINDOW LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY OUT AT THE WIDE-SPREADING LAWN WHERE THE SHADOWS OF THE LOW CEDAR BRANCHES MADE PATCHES OF DARKNESS ON THE MOONLIT SURFACE OF THE GRASS
BUT WHERE IS SAMPSON WILMOT EXCLAIMED MR BALDERBY
BUT NOT A SIGN OF MR DUNBAR WERE FOUND NOWHERE MR CARTER TURNED PALE AND STAMPED HIS FOOT UPON THE GRAVEL-DRIVE
IF THE FIRM IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE SENT YOU DOWN HERE TO ANNOY AND INSULT ME DIRECTLY I SET FOOT UPON BRITISH GROUND THEY HAVE CHOSEN A VERY NICE WAY OF TESTIFYING THEIR RESPECT FOR THEIR CHIEF
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH HE WOULD SIT BROODING IN SILENCE OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S HUMBLE HEARTH FOR HOURS AND DAYS TOGETHER
AND THE CAPTAIN'S A VILLANOUS-LOOKING FELLOW YOU SAY SAID THE DETECTIVE IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE
ARTHUR LOVELL HAD OBSERVED WITH SURPRISE THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD NOT ONCE SPOKEN OF HIS DAUGHTER
BUT--WOULD YOU BELIEVE IN SUCH A RADICAL SPIRIT PERVADIN THE ANIMAL CREATION?--EVERY ONE OF THEM DOVES FLEW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE WINDER AND WENT AND SCATTERED THEIR PERFUMES ON THE POOR FOLKS OUTSIDE
IT SEEMS THAT AN OLD SERVANT A CONFIDENTIAL VALET OF MR DUNBAR'S HAS BEEN MURDERED AT WINCHESTER
YOU WILL SLEEP HERE TO-NIGHT SIR I PRESUME THE SERVANT SAID INTERROGATIVELY AS HE PREPARED TO QUIT THE APARTMENT
THE MAJOR SAT PATIENTLY IN HIS PEW WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED UPON THE LEDGE WHERE THE PRAYER-BOOKS IN THE CORNER OF THE SEATS WERE WONT TO REST DURING DIVINE SERVICE
THIS MATTER MUST REMAIN A SECRET FOR THE PRESENT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU SAMPSON WILMOT
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ALWAYS REMAINED IN HENRY DUNBAR'S FAVOUR--THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WAS THE ROBBERY OF THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES
THIS BUSINESS OCCUPIED HIM FOR A LONG TIME
THE GIRL KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE BOX AND PUT HER CANDLE ON A CHAIR BESIDE IT
FOR HE MUST KNOW THAT SUCH A REFUSAL WOULD EXCITE SUSPICION IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT AT WINCHESTER AND YET HE AVOIDED ME THERE ANSWERED MARGARET WILMOT
TELL YOUR MASTER I'VE SEARCHED THE PLACE AND HAVEN'T FOUND HIS FRIEND HE SAID TO THE GIRL
FOR I HOPE TO SEE MY DAUGHTER TO-NIGHT YOU WILL LEAVE WINCHESTER THIS EVENING THEN YES BY THE 10.15 EXPRESS
IF I COULD HAVE FORGOTTEN THE WRONG YOU DID ME FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT MAN
BUT THE HAND THE DEAR WELL-KNOWN HAND WHICH HAD ADDRESSED THE PACKET--MY BLOOD THRILLED THROUGH MY VEINS AS I RECOGNIZED THE FAMILIAR CHARACTERS
THAT IS THE WORLD'S ARGUMENT BUT NOT THE TEACHING OF THE GOSPEL MARGARET MURMURED
BUT JAMES WENTWORTH BEING A SCAPEGRACE AND A REPROBATE WHO LIVED BY MEANS THAT WERE A SECRET FROM HIS NEIGHBOURS HAD SADLY NEGLECTED THIS ONLY CHILD
SOMETHING IN THAT INSOLENT TONE SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT BACK THE MEMORY OF HALF-FORGOTTEN TIMES STARTLED THE DETECTIVE
AND I'M SURE I ALWAYS WISH YOU TO ENJOY YOURSELF
YOU'LL BE READY TO DROP WITH FEELIN FAINT WHEN YOU GET TO THE ALTAR-RAILS IF YOU PERSIST ON BEIN MARRIED ON A EMPTY STUMMICK MISS LAURA
HALF A SHEET OF PAPER SCRAWLED OVER WITH THE IMITATION OF TWO OR THREE SIGNATURES
THE ANIMAL KNEW HIS MASTER EVEN IN THAT UNCERTAIN LIGHT
THE BANKER LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND MADE A CALCULATION ABOUT THE TIME
I HAVE SEEN LETTERS IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE LETTERS IN HENRY DUNBAR'S HAND SINCE LAST AUGUST THAT'S VERY LIKELY SIR THE DETECTIVE ANSWERED COOLLY
MR CARTER AWOKE THE PORTER AND SENT HIM TO THE STATION-MASTER TO ASK IF ANY LETTER ADDRESSED TO MR HENRY CARTER HAD BEEN LEFT IN THAT FUNCTIONARY'S CARE
SO I'LL SEND HENRY TO WAIT UPON YOU THIS HENRY WHO WAS A SMART ACTIVE YOUNG FELLOW UNPACKED MR DUNBAR'S PORTMANTEAU UNLOCKED HIS DRESSING-CASE AND SPREAD THE GOLD-TOPPED CRYSTAL BOTTLES AND SHAVING APPARATUS UPON THE DRESSING-TABLE
IT'S THE LAST TRIUMPH OF MY BACHELOR DAYS YOU KNOW DARLING THREE CHEERS FOR MISS DUNBAR SHOUTED SOME ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT AMONG THE CROWD ABOUT THE BARONET
HAD I NOT A RIGHT TO PAY HIM A TRIFLE EXTRA FOR DRIVING ME THROUGH FAIRY-LAND
AY SAID JAMES WENTWORTH LOOK YOUR HARDEST AND DENY ME IF YOU CAN
A DIAMOND NECKLACE HE SAID
AND IF HER GREAT BLUE EYES AT SUCH TIMES HAD A TRICK OF LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN FIRE IN THEM LIKE A BURST OF LURID SUNLIGHT THROUGH A SUMMER STORM-CLOUD THERE WERE PLENTY OF GENTLEMEN IN WARWICKSHIRE READY TO SWEAR THAT THE SIGHT OF THOSE LIGHTNING-FLASHES OF WOMANLY ANGER WAS WELL WORTH THE PENALTY OF INCURRING MISS DUNBAR'S DISPLEASURE
PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT HENRY DUNBAR COULD BE GUILTY OF A CRIME WHILE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN READY ENOUGH TO SUSPECT SOME PENNILESS VAGABOND OF ANY INIQUITY ARTHUR LOVELL TOLD CLEMENT THAT THE BANKER WAS STILL AT MAUDESLEY BOUND A PRISONER BY HIS BROKEN LEG WHICH WAS GOING ON FAVOURABLY ENOUGH BUT VERY SLOWLY
BUT CRIED THE OFFICIAL BRIGHTENING SUDDENLY YOU AIN'T A WITNESS MISS ARE YOU
A YOUNG PERSON WISHES TO SEE YOU SIR HE SAID RESPECTFULLY
NOT PARTICULARLY
CLEMENT RAN ACROSS THE PARK TO THE WESTERN ENTRANCE GOT INTO THE FLY AND TOLD THE MAN TO DRIVE BACK TO SHORNCLIFFE BY THE LISFORD ROAD AS FAST AS HE COULD GO AND TO LOOK OUT ON THE WAY FOR THE YOUNG LADY WHOM HE HAD DRIVEN TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY THAT AFTERNOON
OH LAURA SHE SAID THAT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE BUT MISS DUNBAR SHOOK HER HEAD
THAT I DINED TETE-A-TETE WITH MY MOTHER AND FINISHED THE THIRD VOLUME OF CARLYLE'S FRENCH REVOLUTION IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
CLEMENT'S STORY,--BEFORE THE DAWN XLVII
HE ASKED THIS QUESTION IN THE SAME BUSINESS-LIKE TONE IN WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE ADDRESSED A LADY WHO WAS QUITE INDIFFERENT TO HIM
THE LAWYER WATCHED HIS CLIENT NOW WITH INTENSE ANXIETY
SHE WAS HARDLY BETTER THAN A CHILD AS YET WITH ALL A CHILD'S IGNORANT HOPEFULNESS AND BLIND TRUST IN THE UNKNOWN FUTURE
MR CARTER KNELT DOWN BEFORE THIS BUNDLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH TRAILING WEEDS AND MOSS AND SLIME AND THE CONSTABLE STOOPED OVER HIM WITH A FLAMING TORCH IN HIS HAND
CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD GIVEN HER HIS BEST ATTENTION HIS BEST ADVICE
SO OF COURSE I TOOK THE KEY WILLIN TO DO ANY SERVICE AS LAY IN MY POWER
THE TRAIN FROM LONDON TO SOUTHAMPTON WAS DUE IN AN HOUR
HE HAD OFTEN LEFT HER IN THE SAME MANNER AND HAD STAYED AWAY FOR DAYS AND WEEKS TOGETHER
BUT DID THE BANKER MEAN MISCHIEF
BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS THE FRENCHMAN MIGHT HAVE RUN ON MUCH LONGER UPON THIS SUBJECT BUT LAURA WAS TOO IMPATIENT TO BE POLITE
THE SIGHT OF THIS ROOM BROUGHT BACK THE MEMORY OF A PRETTY LAMPLIT PARLOUR WITH AN OLD MAN SITTING IN A HIGH-BACKED EASY-CHAIR
BUT I SHALL KEEP MY EYE UPON HIM NEVERTHELESS
I SAW HIM LAST NIGHT AND THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST AND THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT
AND I THINK THE NEXT BEST THING I CAN DO IS TO SEE THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
IT WAS NOT A SIGH IT WAS A GROAN--A GROAN THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM A BOSOM THAT WAS RENT BY ALL THE AGONY OF DESPAIR
WHO COULD DARE TO SAY I WAS ANY THING OF THE KIND
IT WAS ONLY A KIND OF SAFETY-VALVE BY WHICH THE DETECTIVE LET OFF HIS SUPERFLUOUS STEAM
GONE
SURELY MY DEAR ONE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE--YOU CANNOT BE SO CRUEL AS TO KEEP YOUR SORROW A SECRET FROM HIM WHO HAS SO GOOD A RIGHT TO SHARE IT
HARK
THE MILLIONAIRE COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AND GAVE A LONG SIGH
AND YET THE PICTURE BEFORE HIM COULD HAVE SCARCELY BEEN UNPLEASING TO THE MOST FASTIDIOUS EYE
BUT SHE HAD SPOKEN LIKE A WRETCHED CREATURE WHOSE WITHERED HEART WAS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF WOMANLY EMOTION
IT WILL BE SOMETHING FOR LADY JOCELYN TO BEQUEATH TO HER CHILDREN
HOW SADLY UNPREPARED TO DIE
I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AND I MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERHAPS BUT FOR ONE MAN--BUT FOR ONE BASE-MINDED VILLAIN WHOSE TREACHERY BLASTED MY CHARACTER AND LEFT ME ALONE IN THE WORLD TO FIGHT AGAINST SOCIETY
BUT THERE'S A REWARD TO BE GOT FOR THE TAKING OF YOU FOR ALL THAT
WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE THAT JOSEPH WHY DO I LOOK LIKE THAT CRIED THE YOUNGER MAN
AND THE THOUGHT OF HIS ACKNOWLEDGED GUILT STUNG HER TO THE HEART
MR MICHAEL MARSTON HAD BEEN DEAD MORE THAN TEN YEARS
I WAS SITTING ONE EVENING IN MY MOTHER'S BREAKFAST-PARLOUR--A LITTLE ROOM SITUATED CLOSE TO THE HALL-DOOR--WHEN I HEARD THE RINGING OF THE BELL AT THE GARDEN-GATE
BUT HE COULD NOT BE GUILTY
HER ERRAND WAS A FEARFUL ONE FOR SHE WENT TO TELL SO MUCH AS SHE KNEW OF THE STORY OF THE PAST AND TO BEAR WITNESS AGAINST HENRY DUNBAR
AND YOU REMEMBER ME--JOSEPH WILMOT HE STRUCK HIS HAND UPON HIS BREAST AND STOOD WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE OTHER'S FACE
MASTER HE WERE EXAMINED TO BEGIN WITH
THOUGH HE IS BARELY CLEAR OF THE GREAT CITY'S SMOKY BREATH OR BEYOND THE HEARING OF HER MYRIAD CLAMOROUS TONGUES
HE ROSE EARLY RODE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS UPON HIS CHESTNUT HORSE DRAGON AND THEN BREAKFASTED
MR CARTER MADE HIMSELF VERY COMFORTABLE ON ONE OF THE SOFAS AND SNORED ON PEACEFULLY UNTIL THE PORTER CAME TO ROUSE HIM WHEN HE SPRANG UP REFRESHED TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF EXCITEMENT UPON THIS SUBJECT IN THE MATRIMONIAL MARKET FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AFTER LADY LOUISA'S DEATH
MY LIFE SEEMS VERY HARD TO ME TO-DAY CLEMENT
HAD THE CORONER FOR WINCHESTER BEEN A CLEVER MAN HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THAT GLANCE OF MR DUNBAR'S AND WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE JUNIOR PARTNER KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANTECEDENTS OF THE DEAD MAN
WHAT AM I TO DO WITH MYSELF IN THE INTERIM HE WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF BRADSHAW'S GUIDE AND THINKING
I AM A MOST UNHAPPY WOMAN
BUT HE MUSTN'T BE FOUND OUT UPON THE 16TH OF AUGUST 1850 THE DAY ON WHICH SAMPSON WILMOT THE BANKER'S CLERK WAS TO START FOR SOUTHAMPTON JAMES WENTWORTH SPENT THE MORNING IN HIS DAUGHTER'S HUMBLE LITTLE SITTING-ROOM AND SAT SMOKING BY THE OPEN WINDOW WHILE MARGARET WORKED BESIDE A TABLE NEAR HIM
HAVE YOU COME HERE TO DO THAT
ATTACHED TO THE WATCH THERE WAS A LOCKET OF CHASED YELLOW GOLD
WOULD I OBJECT TO THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
MR AUSTIN WALKED SLOWLY HOMEWARDS PAST PLEASANT COTTAGES NESTLING IN SUBURBAN GARDENS AND PRETENTIOUS VILLAS WITH CAMPANELLO TOWERS AND GOTHIC PORCHES
HE HAD CAREFULLY WEIGHED EVERY SCRAP OF EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ANGLO-INDIAN
THEY WERE RATHER FRIVOLOUS PERHAPS
HAMLET WOULD NOT SO HAVE ACTED HAD IT BEEN HIS FATE TO MARRY THE WOMAN HE LOVED
BUT LADY LOUISA NEVER TRULY RETURNED THE MILLIONAIRE'S AFFECTION
CLEMENT HAD POINTED OUT TO HER THE WINDOWS OF THE ROOMS OCCUPIED BY THE BANKER
HOW SHOULD SUCH AS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I FEEL
THE FROWN THAT BLACKENED AS THE SOUL GREW DARKER
THERE WAS A DEAL OF APPLAUSE IN THE COURT WHEN MR DUNBAR WAS TOLD HE MIGHT CONSIDER HIMSELF FREE SAID THE PORTER
SOUNDING THE PRAISES OF WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM
HE WAS PROUD AND AMBITIOUS
THE TAWNY-VISAGED GENERAL LOVED THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTER BECAUSE HE ADMIRED HER AND NOT BECAUSE HE KNEW HER
HE KNOWS HE MUST BE ADMITTED LET HIM COME WHEN HE MAY THE INVALID GAVE A GROAN AS HE THOUGHT THIS
CLEMENT FOLLOWED HER
I WANT TO BUY A COLLECTION OF DIAMONDS FOR A NECKLACE MR DUNBAR SAID AS COOLLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN TALKING OF A SET OF SILVER SPOONS
THE DEAR OLD INCONVENIENT INNS AND THE EXTORTIONATE LANDLORDS AND THE INSATIABLE COMMISSIONAIRES--HE REVELLED IN THE COMMISSIONAIRES
SHE HAD BEEN SPOILED BY AN ADORING NURSE A DEVOTED GOVERNESS MASTERS WHO HAD FALLEN MADLY IN LOVE WITH THEIR PUPIL AND SERVANTS WHO WERE READY TO WORSHIP THEIR YOUNG MISTRESS
JOSEPH WILMOT MAY BE SITTING DRINKING IN THE SERVANTS HALL AT THE FERNS THE LANDLORD WENT AWAY TO DO HIS GUEST'S BIDDING
WHILE MR DUNBAR LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND ENDEAVOURED TO CONTROL HIS AGITATION
BUT POOR CLEMENT WAS ONLY MORTAL
HE HAD NOT SHOWN HIMSELF A COMMUNICATIVE MAN AT THE BEST OF TIMES AND TO-NIGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A MAN WHOSE SOUL IS WEIGHED DOWN BY THE BURDEN OF A PURPOSE WHICH MUST BE ACHIEVED AT ANY COST OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE
TRY AGAIN FATHER--TRY TO REMEMBER--HENRY DUNBAR THE SON OF PERCIVAL DUNBAR THE GREAT BANKER MR KERSTALL SENIOR WHO NEVER LEFT OFF SMILING NODDED AND CHUCKLED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND SEEMED TO PLUNGE INTO A DEPTH OF PROFOUND THOUGHT
HIS GAME WILL BE TO GET OFF TO ROTTERDAM OR HAMBURGH OR ST PETERSBURG PERHAPS
MY EYES WANDERED VERY OFTEN FROM THE PAGE BEFORE ME AND FIXED THEMSELVES UPON THIS DUSTY SUBURBAN ROAD
AND THAT WAS PITY UNUTTERABLE PITY FOR THE WOMAN I LOVED
BUT WHO SHOULD THINK OF SEARCHING FOR THESE THINGS
THE TWO MEN WERE STILL STANDING FACE TO FACE
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST NOT ONE MOMENT
IT'LL BE QUIETER AND SAFER FOR US TO WALK UP TO THE HOUSE MR TIBBLES WITH HIS BLUE-BAG ON HIS ARM GOT OUT OF THE FLY PREPARED TO ATTEND HIS SUPERIOR WHITHERSOEVER THAT LUMINARY CHOSE TO LEAD HIM
I FOUND THE DECEASED WAITING TO RECEIVE ME WHEN I LANDED HE SAID
IN THE HALL HE STOPPED SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY THE SOUND OF A WOMAN'S VOICE
IT MIGHT AS YOU HAVE SAID BE WISER TO WATCH AND WAIT AND TO AVOID ALL CHANCE OF ALARMING THIS MAN
AND THERE WAS A BANQUET SIR SERVED UP AT NOON THAT DAY AT JOCELYN'S ROCK WITH SIX PEACOCKS BROUGHT TO TABLE WITH THEIR TAILS SPREAD
IS THERE ANYBODY WITH THIS OLD GENTLEMAN YES SIR THE PORTER ANSWERED POINTING TO JOSEPH
ACCORDING TO WHAT BRIGMAWL SAID MR DUNBAR SEEMED AS COOL AND COLLECTED AS IF HE WAS MADE OF IRON
LIZZIE AND ELLEN WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF A MAJOR MELVILLE AND THE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF MISS DUNBAR
I'M AFRAID YOUR FRIEND--YOUR SERVANT--IS FOUND SIR HE SAID
THIS GENTLEMAN HAD ORDERED THE DRIVER TO GO AS FAST AS HE COULD TO SHORNCLIFFE STATION
I SHALL KNOW HOW TO FIND IT THEN
THE CHARMS OF ALL THESE LADIES CONCENTRATED IN THE PERSON OF ONE PERFECT WOMAN WOULD HAVE HAD NO WITCHERY FOR THE BANKER
IF IN THE COURSE OF HIS DUTY HE HAD UNPLEASANT THINGS TO DO
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED WITH THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS TRAILING OVER THE DEWY GRASS AND A FLICKERING HALO OF SUNLIGHT TREMULOUS UPON HER DIADEM OF GOLDEN HAIR
NOT ALTOGETHER UNARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING
BUT I HOPE YOU'LL GO TO BED
CHAMPAGNE MOSELLE HOCK AND BURGUNDY SPARKLED IN SHALLOW GLASSES THAT WERE SHAPED LIKE THE BROAD LEAF OF A WATER-LILY
HIS ACCOMPLICE THE MAN WHO HAD ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED THE FICTITIOUS SIGNATURES WAS THE YOUNGER BROTHER OF SAMPSON WILMOT WHO HAD BEEN A FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO THAT TIME ENGAGED AS MESSENGER IN THE BANKING-HOUSE--A YOUNG FELLOW OF NINETEEN LITTLE BETTER THAN A LAD
CLEMENT HAD BEEN WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE THE IRON GATES OF THE PARK AND THEY HAD NOT BEEN OPENED ONCE DURING THE HOURS IN WHICH HE HAD WAITED OUTSIDE THEM
THE MOTION OF THE STREAM GAVE A LOOK OF LIFE TO HIS FACE AND I ALMOST THOUGHT HE WAS STILL ALIVE AND I HAD NEVER DONE THAT DEED THESE WERE THE PLEASANT FIRESIDE THOUGHTS WITH WHICH THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY BEGUILED THE HOURS OF HIS CONVALESCENCE
LET ME SEE
IN INDIA NO MR DUNBAR NOT IN INDIA
BUT SHE HAS A WILL OF IRON NEVERTHELESS
SHE ALSO TOLD MR AUSTIN HOW HENRY DUNBAR HAD AVOIDED HER AT WINCHESTER AND IN PORTLAND PLACE AND OF THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN TO HER,--A LETTER IN WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO BRIBE HER TO SILENCE
HE'D BEEN TIED BY THE LEG LONG ENOUGH POOR DEVIL
HE HAD TURNED DEADLY PALE AND COLD DROPS OF SWEAT HAD BROKEN OUT UPON HIS FOREHEAD
HIS HEAD WAS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND HE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY RUGBY-WARDS ALONG THE LINE
AS HE DID SO HIS EYES MET THOSE OF THE MAJOR WHO HAD CROSSED THE COURSE WITH SIR PHILIP AND HIS ADMIRERS AND WHO WAS STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AT THE BANKER'S CARRIAGE
CLEMENT AUSTIN STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND
OUR BUSINESS WILL KEEP
WILL YOU BRING TO LIGHT THE MYSTERY OF MY FATHER'S DEATH
THIS TASK WAS NOT AN EASY ONE AND HER FINGERS ACHED BEFORE SHE HAD DONE
THE WRONG I DID WAS DONE FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER
LORD HAVE MERCY UPON ME A SINNER I WAS STILL LOOKING AT THIS BRIEF MEMORIAL WHEN I HEARD A WOMAN'S DRESS RUSTLING UPON THE LONG RANK GRASS AND TURNING SUDDENLY SAW MY DARLING COMING TOWARDS ME VERY PALE VERY PENSIVE BUT WITH A KIND OF SERAPHIC RESIGNATION UPON HER FACE WHICH MADE HER SEEM TO ME MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HER BEFORE
YES ANSWERED THE ANGLO-INDIAN JOSEPH WILMOT HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ME BEFORE I SAILED FOR CALCUTTA BUT WE SETTLED ALL THAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND I PROMISED TO ALLOW HIM AN ANNUITY YOU PROMISED HIM AN ANNUITY YES--NOT A VERY LARGE ONE--ONLY FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR
BUT SOON--AH CRUELLY SOON!--THE NEW CHANCE OF AN HONEST LIFE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM
AND THE FOOTMAN'S MANNER HAD BEEN INNOCENCE ITSELF
BUT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO MAKE A SUGGESTION AS YOUR LEGAL ADVISER IN THIS BUSINESS I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND YOU TO SEE THIS GIRL WHY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS ARE NOTORIOUS GOSSIPS AND SCANDAL-MONGERS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THE HABIT OF OBSERVATION WAS SO STRONG UPON THIS MAN THAT HE OBSERVED THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT THINGS INVOLUNTARILY
THE MILLIONAIRE TURNED AND GREW AS ASHY PALE AT SIGHT OF THE SHABBY STRANGER AS HE COULD HAVE DONE IF THE SHEETED DEAD HAD RISEN FROM ONE OF THE GRAVES NEAR AT HAND
I AM PROUD TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE LOVED ME CLEMENT AUSTIN
HAD IT COME AT LAST LIKE THIS?--QUIETLY IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S WARNING?--BEFORE HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF TO ESCAPE IT OR HARDENED HIMSELF TO MEET IT
AND WHEN OUR LEG HAS BEEN SET AND WE'VE TAKEN A COOLING DRAUGHT WE SHALL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR THE NIGHT
THE ADMIRAL DIED IN THE HOUSE AND HAVING BEEN A BACHELOR AND HIS MONEY HAVING GONE TO DISTANT RELATIVES THE LEASE AND FURNITURE OF THE COTTAGE WILL BE SOLD
YET SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIS FACE
AND THOUGH THE JOURNEY BETWEEN SHORNCLIFFE AND RUGBY WAS ONLY TO LAST AN HOUR IT SEEMED ALMOST INTERMINABLE TO THIS IMPATIENT TRAVELLER WHO WAS EAGER TO STAND UPON THE DECK OF MESSRS
HE MARRIED IN 1831 AND HE HAS AN ONLY CHILD A DAUGHTER WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN ENGLAND SINCE HER INFANCY UNDER THE CARE OF MR PERCIVAL YES ANSWERED MR BALDERBY I HAVE SEEN MISS LAURA DUNBAR AT HER GRANDFATHER'S COUNTRY SEAT
MY WHOLE LIFE HANGS UPON THE ISSUE AND I WILL SPEAK
I WAITED ABOUT THE STREETS
WALFORD AND WALFORD OUR OWN SOLICITORS LET MR LOVELL GO WITH YOU CRIED MISS DUNBAR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY TELLING ANECDOTES
POOR JOSEPH!--POOR BOY!--POOR BOY
MY DEAR CLEMENT MRS AUSTIN EXCLAIMED AT LAST YOU REALLY QUITE ALARM ME
YOU MAY COUNTERMAND THE DINNER MR DUNBAR SAID WITH EVIDENT VEXATION
SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HER FATHER BY THE NAME OF JAMES WENTWORTH
NOTHING COULD BE MORE DESIRABLE THAN THE WAY IN WHICH WE ARE GOING ON
ENOUGH LAURA HE SAID QUIETLY
BUT MR DUNBAR DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF TO NOTICE ANY SUCH INSIGNIFICANT FACT AS THE MERRIMENT OF HIS OLD VALET
BUT HE LIFTED HIS HEAD PRESENTLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE AND WENT SLOWLY UP THE LIGHTED STAIRCASE
WE'LL GO TO MR KERSTALL IMMEDIATELY IF YOU LIKE
I THOUGHT YOUR CUTLETS THE MOST ETHEREAL MORSELS EVER DISHED BY MORTAL COOK MR GILWOOD AND THIS ROOM THE BEST PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD
HE TOOK OUT THE MEMORANDUM-BOOK FIRST AND EXAMINED IT
AND WHO SHOULD AVENGE HIS DEATH IF I DO NOT
A RECKLESS BOY EASILY INFLUENCED BY THE DASHING SOLDIER WHO HAD NEED OF HIS SERVICES
THE THREE MEN ASSEMBLED IN THE QUIET ROOM BEHIND THE BANK ON THIS OPPRESSIVE AUGUST EVENING WERE TALKING TOGETHER OF THAT OLD STORY
HOW HAD IT BEEN DONE
IF THAT GRAND WONDER OF SCIENCE THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH SHOULD BE MADE USE OF BY THE MEN SHE DREADED SHE WOULD BE TOO LATE UPON THE ERRAND SHE WAS GOING ON
IF I HAD INQUIRED HER TERMS
AND HE VENTURED TO EXPRESS HIS REGRET FOR THE LOSS WHICH SHE HAD EXPERIENCED
THOUGH I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE HAD MUCH TO REGRET IN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HER
WILMOT HE EXCLAIMED
HENRY DUNBAR HAS BEEN RATHER QUEER IN HIS WAYS SINCE THAT RAILWAY SMASH JUST SO
EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAD PASSED SINCE THE BLEAK WINTER'S NIGHT ON WHICH THE BOX OF DIAMONDS HAD BEEN INTRUSTED TO ME
I SHALL GIVE YOU THE HANDSOMEST DIAMOND-NECKLACE THAT WAS EVER MADE IN ENGLAND
NEVERTHELESS WHEN HE CAME OUT INTO THE HALL BY-AND-BY WITH A SET SMILE UPON HIS FACE LIKE A MAN WHO IS GOING TO ACT A PART IN A PLAY LAURA DUNBAR RECOILED FROM HIM WITH AN INVOLUNTARY SHIVER AS SHE HAD DONE UPON THE DAY OF HER FIRST MEETING WITH HIM IN PORTLAND PLACE
BUT I AM QUITE READY TO GO WITH YOU
LADY LOUISA MARRIED THE RICH MAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER HER FIRST HUSBAND'S DEATH
BRADDON
AND BEYOND A STATELY WAY OF BANGING-TO A CARRIAGE-DOOR OR SHOWING VISITORS TO THEIR ROOMS OR POKING A FIRE AND A KIND OF KNACK OF LEADING ON TIMID PEOPLE TO ORDER EXPENSIVE WINES I REALLY DON'T SEE BRIGMAWL'S GREAT MERIT
HE HAD WELL-NIGH SUFFOCATED HIMSELF WITH DUST HALF-A-DOZEN TIMES ALREADY IN HER SERVICE AND WAS READY TO INHALE AS MUCH MORE DUST IF SHE DESIRED HIM SO TO DO
ONE PERSON DID SEE THE VAGUE CHANGE IN HER MANNER
DORA SHE SAID BY-AND-BY DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT DEAR DON'T YOU KNOW THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT ONE WEDDING MAKING MANY DORA MACMAHON BLUSHED
AND THEN THE GENTLEMAN SAT AND RESTED IN MASTER'S LITTLE PARLOUR AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
YOU'RE A NICE AFFECTIONATE BROTHER TO WISH TO SHUFFLE ME OFF DIRECTLY AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN CLEMENT AUSTIN SHE SAID
AND IT ALSO HAPPENED THAT MISS MACMAHON HAVING RECEIVED SEVERAL PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE OLD ADAGE WITH REGARD TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF A PARTY OF THREE PERSONS AS COMPARED TO A PARTY OF TWO PERSONS FELL INTO THE HABIT OF CARRYING HER BOOKS WITH HER AND WOULD SIT AND READ IN SOME SHADY NOOK NEAR THE ABBEY WHILE LAURA WANDERED INTO THE WILDER REGIONS OF THE PARK
GRINDING HIS TEETH AND CLENCHING HIS STRONG HANDS
THEN HE SLAPPED HIS LEG WITH A SOUNDING AND TRIUMPHANT SLAP
I FULLY BELIEVED THIS NOW
BUT WITH MARGARET I NEED NO WORDS TO TELL ME THAT I AM UNDERSTOOD
BUT SHE SUCCEEDED AT LAST AND LIFTED THE LID OF THE TRUNK
BUT THE WAITER HE TELLS ME AS DIGNIFIED AND COOL AS YER PLEASE THAT THE LAME GENTLEMAN HAS GONE OUT BY THE DOOR LOOKING TOWARDS THE WATER AND HAS ONLY GONE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE PLACE AND GET A FEW CIGARS AND WILL BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES TO A CHOP WHICH IS BEIN COOKED FOR HIM
THEN WITH HER SLENDER FINGERS SHE TRIED TO UNFASTEN THE KNOTS THAT SECURED THE CORD
FOR I HAD SAVED UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND POUNDS DURING MY TWELVE YEARS SERVICE IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
MY MOTHER KEEPS HOUSE FOR US
WE WALKED HOMEWARDS AS RAPIDLY AS THE MISERABLE STATE OF THE PATH THE INCREASING DARKNESS AND THE FALLING RAIN WOULD ALLOW US TO WALK
THE FACE IS SO BEAUTIFUL,--AS BEAUTIFUL NOW THAT I HAVE LEARNED THE TRICK OF EVERY FEATURE THOUGH EVEN NOW I CANNOT LEARN ALL THE VARYING CHANGES OF EXPRESSION WHICH MAKE IT EVER NEW TO ME AS IT WAS THAT EVENING WHEN IT BEAMED ON ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE SAW DOUBT PERPLEXITY HORROR INDECISION ALL STRUGGLING IN HIS HANDSOME FACE
GOOD NIGHT REPEATED THE BANKER TURNING HIS BACK UPON HIS FRIEND AND ABOUT TO RE-ENTER THE HOUSE
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT A BITTER WINTRY NIGHT IN WHICH I SHOULD LEAST HAVE EXPECTED ANY VISITOR
IF MR TIBBLES IS TRUE,--AND AS HE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXTRA REWARD OR THE EVIDENCE THAT'S TURNED UP AT WINCHESTER,--I DARE SAY THOMAS TIBBLES WILL BE TRUE
MR DUNBAR HIMSELF OFFERED A REWARD FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE GUILTY PARTY DIDN'T HE YES
HER EYES WERE FIXED AND LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HER WITH A THOUGHTFUL GAZE THAT WAS STRANGE TO HER
DEAR GRANDPAPA WENT EVERYWHERE WITH ME MRS MADDEN SHOOK HER HEAD SOLEMNLY
HE WAS SHABBY CERTAINLY
HER SHAWL AND DRESS WERE WET WITH MELTED SNOW
HIS FORMER MOODY SILENCE HAD BEEN SUCCEEDED BY A MANNER THAT WAS ALMOST UNNATURALLY GAY
THE GREAT MR KRUSIBLE WHO THRUST THE LAST INCH OF AN EASTERN POTENTATE'S SCEPTRE INTO THE MELTING-POT WITH THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT AS THE DETECTIVES ENTERED HIS ESTABLISHMENT IN SEARCH OF THE MISSING BAUBLE AND WALKED LAME FOR SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS LIVED SOMEWHERE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CITY AND FAR AWAY FROM THIS DULL-LOOKING HOLBORN STREET
HE SPRANG INTO THE VEHICLE AND WAS DRIVEN OFF TO THE STATION
ALL HENRY DUNBAR'S LUGGAGE HAD BEEN PLACED IN THIS ROOM
BRING ME THE CANDLES--BOTH THE CANDLES HE SAID TO THE CONSTABLE
AND MR CARTER PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD COME STRAIGHT TO THE GEORGE HOTEL AT WHICH HOUSE HENRY DUNBAR STAYED AFTER THE MURDER IN THE GROVE
AND I WALKED ABOUT THE QUIET TOWN EXPECTING AT EVERY TURN IN THE STREET AT EVERY APPROACHING FOOTSTEP SOUNDING ON THE PAVEMENT TO SEE THE FIGURE I HAD SEEN LAST NIGHT
HE MUST HAVE KNOWN IT WHEN HE REFUSED TO SEE ME IN PORTLAND PLACE
AND DUTY WAS THE CONQUEROR
NO THE NEW MASTER OF THE ABBEY WAS NOT LIKED
WHY SHOULD A MILLIONAIRE COMMIT A MURDER
IT MAY BE THAT THE BANKER HAD AN UNPLEASANT RECOLLECTION OF HIS LAST VISIT TO ST GUNDOLPH LANE UPON THE DAY WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE FORGED BILLS WAS DISCOVERED BY PERCIVAL AND HUGH DUNBAR
MR CARTER HAD STUDIED EVERY SCRAP OF EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER OF JOSEPH WILMOT
AND THEN THE VOICES OF THE BRIDESMAIDS BROKE LOOSE AND THERE WAS A PLEASANT BUZZ OF CONGRATULATION WHICH BEGUILED THE TIME WHILE LAURA WAS EXCHANGING HER BRIDAL COSTUME FOR A LONG RUSTLING DRESS OF DOVE-COLOURED SILK A PURPLE-VELVET CLOAK TRIMMED AND LINED WITH SABLE AND A MIRACULOUS FABRIC OF PALE-PINK AREOPHANE AND STARRY JASMINE-BLOSSOMS WHICH THE PARISIAN MILLINER FACETIOUSLY ENTITLED A BONNET SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS PRESENTLY IN THIS RICH ATTIRE LOOKING LIKE A RUSSIAN EMPRESS IN ALL THE GLORY OF HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY
BUT I QUESTION WHETHER HE COULD HAVE RESISTED THE INFLUENCE OF A WET DAY
WE SHALL BE HAPPY TO WAIT UPON YOU SIR HE SAID
THE MAN LOOKED AT THEM DOUBTFULLY
THE MAN MUST BE MADE OF IRON ARTHUR LOVELL THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THE THREE MEN WERE ASSEMBLED IN THIS GLOOMY PRIVATE ROOM AFTER OFFICE HOURS ON A SULTRY AUGUST EVENING IN ORDER TO CONSULT TOGETHER UPON RATHER AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT NAMELY THE RECEPTION OF HENRY DUNBAR THE NEW HEAD OF THE FIRM
IF MY SON COMES INTO THE BANK THIS MORNING SEND HIM TO ME AND DID THE YOUNG MAN COME ASKED THE JUNIOR PARTNER
THE REWARD WAS A LARGE ONE
TEN MILES OR THEREABOUTS I BELIEVE JOSEPH ANSWERED
SHE WALKED ALONG BY THIS FENCE LOOKING FOR THE GATE
HE WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND I LIKED HIS SOCIETY BUT THE JOURNEY TO THE FERNS AND BACK WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED SOME TIME PERHAPS SO ANSWERED MR DUNBAR
BY THE BYE YOU WILL PUT UP AT ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS AT SOUTHAMPTON--SAY THE DOLPHIN--AND WAIT THERE TILL THE ELECTRA STEAMER COMES IN
AND HERE I FOUND A YOUNG LADY SITTING READING BY THE DYING LIGHT
IT WAS RATHER A BROAD HINT
MARGARET WILMOT WATCHED HIM WITH EAGER SCRUTINIZING EYES
AND THIS IS HOW MARGARET WILMOT PARTED FROM CLEMENT AUSTIN
HENRY DUNBAR TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE COUNTY AS A PERSON OF IMPORTANCE
YOU WILL GO WITH HER MADGE OSTENSIBLY UPON A LITTLE PLEASURE TRIP
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS STIFF POLITENESS HIS STUDIED SMILE HIS DELIBERATE SPEECH SOMETHING ENTIRELY VAGUE AND INDEFINABLE WHICH HAD THE SAME CHILLY EFFECT UPON SIR PHILIP'S FRIENDLINESS AS A COLD CELLAR HAS ON DELICATE-FLAVOURED PORT
THE SKY WAS ALL OF ONE EQUAL GREY TINT AND SEEMED TO HANG ONLY A LITTLE WAY ABOVE THE EARTH
HE STOOD BEFORE THE CHEVAL-GLASS AND TWIRLED HIS MOUSTACHE AS HE SPOKE LOOKING AT HIMSELF THOUGHTFULLY WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE
YES MR CARTER WAS ABLE TO STEER
AND AT HALF-PAST SEVEN OR THEREABOUTS NEXT MORNING HENRY DUNBAR WOULD BE RATTLING THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS
BUT THEN I HAD SO FEW RELICS OF THE WOMAN WHO WAS TO HAVE BEEN MY WIFE
ARE YOU WILLING TO ACT UNDER ORDERS I TOLD MR CARTER THAT I WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO OBEY HIS ORDERS IN EVERYTHING SO LONG AS WHAT I DID HELPED THE PURPOSES OF OUR JOURNEY
CLEMENT FOLLOWED HER INTO THE HALL
FABRICATED FORGED BANK NOTES OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE I HEARD
BUT I HOPE THAT LATE AS IT IS WE MAY BE MORE FORTUNATE NOW
HE PUT THE PORTMANTEAU IN A CORNER NEAR THE FIREPLACE
I KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF AS I WENT HOME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE NEWLY-RISEN MOON THE PALE CRESCENT THAT GLIMMERED HIGH IN A CLOUDLESS HEAVEN
AND HAD DELIBERATELY ARRIVED AT THIS CONCLUSION
SHE DRANK ABOUT A TEASPOONFUL AND THEN WENT ON SPEAKING VERY RAPIDLY AND IN BROKEN SENTENCES I FOLLOWED THE MAN KEEPING A GOOD WAY BEHIND SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT SEE THAT HE WAS FOLLOWED
I AM BUYING THEM FOR A NECKLACE FOR MY DAUGHTER YOU ARE SO DOTINGLY FOND OF YOUR DAUGHTER SAID THE MAJOR WITH A LEER
WHY DIDN'T YOU LOOK AFTER THE POOR LAME GENTLEMAN WHO STAYED AT WOODBINE COTTAGE LISFORD AND DRESSED UP HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER AS A HOUSEMAID AND ACTED A LITTLE PLAY TO SELL YOU YOU PRECIOUS CLEVER POLICE-OFFICER IN PLAIN CLOTHES
BUT USE HER AS HE MIGHT HE WAS ALWAYS PROUD OF HER AND FOND OF HER
HE HAD TAKEN HIS HAT BEFORE GOING TO THE STABLE
AND SHE HAD GROWN NOW TO SHUN HIM
WAS IT NOT A GREAT DEAL MORE LIKELY THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD SPENT THE AFTERNOON DRINKING IN THE TAP-ROOM OF SOME ROADSIDE PUBLIC-HOUSE AND HAD RAMBLED BACK INTO THE GROVE AFTER DARK TO MEET HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF SOME EVERY-DAY ASSASSIN BENT ONLY UPON PLUNDER
DON'T TURN SO WHITE
IF AT TIMES HE HAD TO STOOP TO ACTS WHICH IN OTHER MEN WOULD BE BRANDED AS SHAMEFUL AND TREACHEROUS HE KNEW THAT HE DID HIS DUTY AND THAT SOCIETY COULD NOT HOLD TOGETHER UNLESS SOME SUCH MEN AS HIMSELF--CLEAR-HEADED BRAVE RESOLUTE AND UNSCRUPULOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF UNPLEASANT WORK--WERE WILLING TO ACT AS WATCH-DOGS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE GENERAL FOLD AND TO THE TERROR OF SAVAGE AND MARAUDING BEASTS
SHE ONLY GREW PALER THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND PRESSED HER TWO HANDS ON HER BREAST AS IF TO STILL THE SUDDEN TUMULT OF HER HEART
SILENT FOOTMEN GLIDED NOISELESSLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BEHIND THE CHAIRS OF THE GUESTS
BUT IT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO WALK UP AND DOWN A DUSTY COUNTRY ROAD WITH THE WIND BITING LIKE SOME RAVENOUS ANIMAL AT THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE AND NO MORE CONSCIOUSNESS OF YOUR LEGS AND ARMS THAN IF YOU WERE A MISS BIFFIN
HER THOUGHTS MIGHT WANDER AWAY INTO VAGUE SPECULATIONS ABOUT HER FATHER'S ABSENCE WHILE SHE SAT BY HER PUPIL'S SIDE
I FEAR THAT I WAS WEAK ENOUGH TO FEEL BEWILDERED BY THE PENSIVE LOVELINESS OF THE FACE AT WHICH I LOOKED AND THAT MY CONFIDENCE EBBED AWAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THOSE GRAVE HAZEL EYES
YES THE WOMAN TOLD ME
BUT THE DOOK DIDN'T TREAT ME AS LIBERAL AS THIS HERE SIR MR DUNBAR SMILED
I AM SORRY FOR THE SCRAPE I GOT YOU INTO AND AM READY TO DO ANYTHING REASONABLE TO ATONE FOR THAT OLD BUSINESS
A PAMPERED IDOLIZED BEAUTY
HE HAD NOT SEEMED CONFUSED OR EXCITED OR HURRIED OR FRIGHTENED
CLEMENT AUSTIN THE CASHIER AT DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY'S ANGLO-INDIAN BANKING-HOUSE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE MODEST HAZEL-EYED MUSIC-MISTRESS AND HAD SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO WATCH HER AND TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HER LONG BEFORE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE REAL NATURE OF HIS FEELINGS
MR DUNBAR DID NOT WASTE MUCH TIME BEFORE HE BEGAN THE GRAND BUSINESS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM TO LONDON--THAT IS TO SAY THE PURCHASE OF SUCH A COLLECTION OF DIAMONDS AS COMPOSE A NECKLACE SECOND ONLY TO THAT WHICH BROUGHT POOR HOODWINKED CARDINAL DE ROHAN AND THE UNLUCKY DAUGHTER OF THE CAESARS INTO SUCH A MORASS OF TROUBLE AND SLANDER
THEY WERE SMALL ROOMS WITH SMALL FURNITURE
THAT THE CRIME COMMITTED IN THE QUIET GROVE NEAR ST CROSS WAS AN EVERY-DAY DEED DONE FOR THE MOST PITIFUL AND SORDID MOTIVES THAT CAN TEMPT A MAN TO SHED HIS BROTHER'S BLOOD NEVER FOR A MOMENT ENTERED INTO HER THOUGHTS
THE STEEPLE-CHASE XXIII
I HAVE BEEN QUITE ALARMED BY HER STRANGE ABSENCE SO HAVE I MOTHER
THE GIRL'S CHIEF SORROW WAS THAT HER FATHER WHO TO HER MIND WAS CALCULATED TO SHINE IN THE HIGHEST STATION THE WORLD COULD GIVE SHOULD BE A REPROBATE AND A PAUPER
HE SPREAD THE TOWELS ON THE TABLE AND THEN TOOK THE SLIMY BUNDLE FROM THE BASKET
AND I KNEW ALL ALONG THAT WHOEVER STRIPPED OFF THOSE CLOTHES MUST HAVE HAD A VERY STRONG REASON FOR DOING IT
WHETHER HE HAD ENLISTED AS A PRIVATE AND HAD BEEN BOUGHT-OFF BY HIS FRIENDS
I AM NO FIT ASSOCIATE FOR AN HONEST MAN
MARGARET WENTWORTH,--THAT IS HER NAME
BUT VERY LITTLE NEW EVIDENCE WAS ELICITED
THE MAJOR HAD BEEN VERY LUCKY IN HIS SPECULATIONS ON THE SHORNCLIFFE RACES AND HAD GONE STRAIGHT AWAY FROM THE COURSE TO THE VILLAGE OF LISFORD WHERE HE TOOK UP HIS ABODE AT THE HOSE AND CROWN A BRIGHT-LOOKING HOSTELRY WHERE A TRAVELLER COULD HAVE HIS STEAK OR HIS CHOP DONE TO A TURN IN ONE OF THE COSIEST KITCHENS IN ALL WARWICKSHIRE
NEVER MIND MY QUESTIONS
BETWEEN THE END OF THE PASSAGE AND THE OUTER DOORS OF THE BANK HENRY DUNBAR SAW THE FIGURE OF A WOMAN SITTING NEAR ONE OF THE DESKS AND TALKING TO CLEMENT AUSTIN
BUT SURELY IT WOULD BE MORE HORRIBLE IF I WERE CONTENT TO LET MY FATHER'S MURDER REMAIN UNAVENGED
IT IS REALLY VERY MUCH TOO BAD OF HIM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE POSITION IN WHICH HE STANDS TOWARDS ME THE BANKER SPOKE WITH THE OFFENDED TONE OF A PROUD AND SELFISH MAN WHO FEELS THAT HE HAS BEEN OUTRAGED BY HIS INFERIOR
I DID NOT THINK THERE WOULD EVER COME A TIME IN WHICH YOU WOULD REJECT MY SYMPATHY I WILL TALK TO YOU TO-MORROW MARGARET SAID FOR THE SECOND TIME
BUT IF THAT IS YOUR ENGLISH LAW I AM NOT SORRY THAT THE BEST PART OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN PASSED IN INDIA
FOR SHE WAS AS EAGER AS A CHILD WHO IS INTENT UPON SOME SCHEME OF PLEASURE
IT IS I MARGARET WILMOT THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED IN THE GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER THE DOG AWOKE AND SNAPPED AT HER
YOUR BROTHER IS DEAD I SUPPOSE I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE SO SIR ANSWERED THE OLD CLERK PRODUCING A RED COTTON HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPING AWAY A COUPLE OF TEARS THAT WERE SLOWLY TRICKLING DOWN HIS POOR FADED CHEEKS
SOME OF THESE WERE FANCY HEADS AND SOME SKETCHES FOR GRAND HISTORICAL PICTURES
HE IS RICH SHE THOUGHT AND THEY SAY THAT WEALTH CAN BUY ALL THE BEST THINGS UPON THIS EARTH
ONE MAN DEPOSED TO HAVING MET A ROUGH-LOOKING FELLOW HALF-GIPSY HALF-HAWKER IN THE GROVE BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT O'CLOCK
BUT I NEVER HEARD ANY MORE OF HIM MR KERSTALL REMOVED THE INDIAN OFFICER AND SUBSTITUTED ANOTHER PORTRAIT
NEW BONNETS HAD BEEN SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR THIS FESTIVE OCCASION
IT WAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT MADE HER SHRINK AWAY FROM ME THAT NIGHT WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS A CONTAMINATED CREATURE UNFIT TO BE THE ASSOCIATE OF AN HONEST MAN OH MARGARET MARGARET
YOU HAVE MADE HER LOOK QUITE ILL
SAMPSON'S CARPET-BAG AND PORTMANTEAU HAD BEEN LEFT IN THIS SITTING-ROOM
THERE'S NO FLIES TO BE HAD AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT MISS HE SAID CIVILLY ENOUGH
AS IF SHE DRAGGED HERSELF ALONG BY A PAINFUL EFFORT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL CONTENT TO SINK UPON THE CARPETED FLOOR AND LIE THERE HELPLESS AND INERT
IT WAS NOW A QUARTER PAST FIVE
PRINCE LOUIS NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE WAS ONLY FIRST PRESIDENT AS YET
I WOULD NOT WISH TO INTRUDE UPON YOU AT SUCH A TIME
AND I--WISH THAT I WERE BETTER WORTHY OF YOU
TO-DAY HAS BEEN MOST WRETCHED--A DAY OF MISERABLE DISCOVERIES
BUT THE BRIGHT THINGS OF THIS WORLD WERE NOT FOR HER
LET THEM COME WHEN THEY PLEASE THEY HAVE NO PROOF AGAINST ME NO PROOF
DON'T MIND THEM LAURA DEAR SIR PHILIP SAID
THAT'S WHY THE CLOTHES WERE STRIPPED OFF THE BODY AND HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM WHERE THE WATER SEEMED DEEPEST
SO MUCH FOR THE FIRST PLACE
AND ARTHUR LOVELL LOOKING AT HIS CLIENT AT THIS MOMENT SAW THE CHANGE
WHO IS THE WOMAN SHE IS A YOUNG LADY SIR A YOUNG LADY YES SIR WHAT BRINGS HER HERE THE CASHIER HESITATED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE HE REPLIED SHE--WISHES TO SEE YOU MR DUNBAR HE SAID AFTER THAT BRIEF PAUSE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WAKING ME OUT OF SLEEP HE ASKED
HE WAS NO LONGER A VAGABOND
EVERY PAWNBROKER'S SHOP IN WINCHESTER AND IN EVERY TOWN WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS OF WINCHESTER WAS SEARCHED BUT WITHOUT EFFECT
TELL YOUR MASTER SHE SAID THAT I WILL DIE OF STARVATION SOONER THAN I WOULD ACCEPT BREAD FROM HIS HAND
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S DIARY
BUT THE OFFER OF A DEPOSIT OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO GAVE A DIFFERENT ASPECT TO THE CASE
ALL THIS CERTAINLY SEEMED TO HINT AT THE GUILT OF MR DUNBAR
AND PERCIVAL THE YOUNGER OF THESE BROTHERS HAD LATELY DIED AT EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE LEAVING HIS ONLY SON HENRY DUNBAR SOLE INHERITOR OF HIS ENORMOUS WEALTH
THE GABLED COTTAGE-ROOFS WERE LOP-SIDED WITH AGE
I HAVE WORKED THIS BUSINESS OUT BY MY OWN LIGHTS AND I'VE BEEN RIGHT
THE DIFFERENT SCRAPS OF EVIDENCE THAT HINTED AT HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CONDEMN HIM
THIS WILL SQUARE THE LANDLORD AND THE WAITERS AND THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN TELL US THAT THEY WON'T TELL US WILLINGLY
AND I WAS QUITE AS TRUE TO MARGARET WHILE ASSOCIATING WITH AGREEABLE PEOPLE AND HEARING CHEERFUL VOICES BUZZING ROUND ME AS I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A HERMITAGE WHOSE STILLNESS WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE HOWLING OF THE STORM
HE WAS USED TO IT
SAW YOU GET INTO A CAB
MR CARTER TOLD ME A GREAT DEAL OF HIS EXPERIENCE DURING OUR JOURNEY DOWN TO WINCHESTER
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS CREPT BY
THE MOROCCO-COVERED ARM-CHAIRS HAD BEEN RE-COVERED PERHAPS DURING THAT FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS
THIS OPERATION LASTED FOR SEVERAL HOURS
READING FADED DOCUMENTS TYING UP OLD PAPERS MAKING NOTES UPON THE BACKS OF LETTERS AND OTHER NOTES IN HIS OWN MEMORANDUM-BOOK
IT'S RATHER A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO WITHDRAW FROM THE BUSINESS HE SAID RUBBING HIS CHIN THOUGHTFULLY
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT MR VINCENT HAD BEEN RIGHT
WAS IT LIKELY THAT A MILLIONAIRE WOULD COMMIT A MURDER
THE MAJOR CONTRIVED TO ENGAGE THE TORY BEADLE IN CONVERSATION WHICH WAS NOT VERY DIFFICULT SEEING THAT THE AFORESAID BEADLE WAS ALWAYS READY TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE
FOR THE NEWS OF THE ACCIDENT HAD REACHED MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT MR DUNBAR HAD BEEN A SUFFERER
I SHOULD HAVE TRAVELLED BY THAT TRAIN YESTERDAY EVENING BUT FOR THIS TERRIBLE EVENT ARTHUR LOVELL LOOKED RATHER ASTONISHED AT THIS
THE PRISONER IS REMANDED XIV
LOOKING FOR THE PORTRAIT
IT IS A CASE OF MENTAL EXCITEMENT CLEMENT SAID
AND I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH MY POOR TENDER-HEARTED LAMB
MOTHER HE SAID YOU SHOULD NOT TALK OF THESE THINGS BEFORE MISS WENTWORTH
BY MEANS OF THIS NEW AND MOST LIBERAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH DEMANDED FROM ME A VERY MODERATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL I BECAME JUNIOR PARTNER IN THE FIRM WHICH WAS NOW CONDUCTED UNDER THE NAMES OF DUNBAR DUNBAR BALDERBY AND AUSTIN
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAPITAL OPENING FOR YOUR SPEECH AS COUNSEL FOR THE CROWN
E
FOR HE WAS GROWING DESPERATE NOW WITH THE IDEA THAT HIS MAN HAD ESCAPED HIM
AND WHEN THEY DO I MAKE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT THEY KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE THE ADVANTAGE
NEVER STIRRING NEVER LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM HIS BREAST
MR HUGH DUNBAR HANDED HIM THE FORGED BILL
WE MUST REDUCE THE SWELLING BEFORE WE CAN VENTURE UPON ANY IMPORTANT STEP
BEFORE HE WENT BACK TO THE QUIET ROUTINE OF LIFE HE SET HIMSELF A TASK TO ACCOMPLISH AND THAT TASK WAS THE SOLUTION OF THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY
DON'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED MADGE
OH WHAT AM I TO DO SIR
AND IT IS WONDERFUL TO ME TO FIND HOW MARGARET'S TASTES AND OPINIONS COINCIDE WITH MINE
BUT CLEMENT AUSTIN KNEW THAT FOR HENRY DUNBAR THERE WERE VERY HUMILIATING AND UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICES IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE AND IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED THAT A MAN WOULD COME SMILING INTO A PLACE OUT OF WHICH HE HAD GONE FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS BEFORE A DISGRACED AND DEGRADED CREATURE
AND BY THE TIME THE TRAVELLERS REACHED WINCHESTER THEY WERE ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH EACH OTHER
TO SCATTER HER MONEY RIGHT AND LEFT
HE WOULD DO THIS THAT AND THE OTHER AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY IN YORKSHIRE AND IN PORTLAND PLACE
HE GAVE A LOW GROAN
I KNOW AS WELL AS YOU DO THAT YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME
HE WAS CLOSE TO THE WINDOW AND HE HEARD SOMETHING BESIDES THE KNOCKING--A WOMAN'S VOICE NOT LOUD BUT PECULIARLY AUDIBLE BY REASON OF ITS EARNESTNESS
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO DO MY DARLING I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A LONG DAY IN THE LUXEMBOURG
AND I PICTURED TO MYSELF THE HORROR OF THAT SCENE AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY WHEN THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER STOOD OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER AND MARGARET WILMOT DISCOVERED WHY THE MURDERER HAD PERSISTENTLY HIDDEN HIMSELF FROM HER
BUT THERE WAS NONE
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D CARE ABOUT THAT WOULD YOU MISS
I REMEMBER PAINTING SIR JASPER RIVINGTON WHO WAS LORD MAYOR IN THE YEAR--BLESS MY HEART HOW THE DATES DO SLIP OUT OF MY MIND TO BE SURE!--I REMEMBER PAINTING HIM IN HIS ROBES TOO
HE TOLD HIS COMPANION WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE ADJOURNED EXAMINATION
YES SIR IT WERE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE LAST MR HOGSON SAID
WHAT WOULD BE THAT INNOCENT GIRL'S FEELINGS IF IT SHOULD BE SO AND IF HER FATHER'S GUILT SHOULD BE BROUGHT HOME TO HIM YES IT WOULD BE VERY TERRIBLE FOR LADY JOCELYN NO DOUBT CLEMENT ANSWERED
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK HE SAID STOPPING PRESENTLY AND TAKING ME BY THE BUTTON-HOLE
NOT AT ALL ANSWERED MARGARET
I DON'T WANT ANY INTRUDERS HE MUTTERED
THE RAILWAY OFFICIAL TO WHOM SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF AT THE WINCHESTER STATION TREATED HER WITH CIVILITY AND GOOD-NATURE
WELL YOU SEE SIR ONE OF THE BILLS WAS BROUGHT TO OUR COUNTER AND THE CASHIER DIDN'T MUCH LIKE THE LOOK OF MY LORD'S SIGNATURE AND HE TOOK THE BILL TO THE INSPECTOR AND THE INSPECTOR SAID PAY THE MONEY BUT DON'T DEBIT IT AGAINST HIS LORDSHIP ABOUT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS THE INSPECTOR CARRIED THE BILL TO MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR AND DIRECTLY HE SET EYES UPON IT HE KNEW THAT LORD VANLORME'S ACCEPTANCE WAS A FORGERY
DRIVEN FROM EVERY PLACE WHERE ONCE HE FOUND A WELCOME THE RUINED WRETCH HIDES HIMSELF AMONG STRANGERS AND TRIES TO SINK HIS HATEFUL IDENTITY UNDER A FALSE NAME
SURELY YOU DON'T MEAN IT
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO MR GROGSON THE AUCTIONEER AND FROM THAT GENTLEMAN HEARD ALL PARTICULARS RESPECTING THE PENDING SALE AT WOODBINE COTTAGE
HERE WAS AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN A MAN WHOSE WEALTH WAS SOMETHING FABULOUS NEWLY RETURNED FROM INDIA EAGER TO EMBRACE HIS ONLY CHILD
CLEMENT AUSTIN AND A MAN--A DETECTIVE CLEMENT AUSTIN--YOUR LOVER--YOUR CONFEDERATE
IT'S HORRIBLY WET
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF WE HAD BEEN LIVING LATELY IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF ENIGMAS
CHAPTER XXI
AFTER ALL IT IS A SILLY OLD-FOGEYISH HABIT THIS OF DIARY-KEEPING
PUNCTUAL TO THE VERY STRIKING OF THE CLOCK MARGARET WILMOT PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE GEORGE AT THE TIME APPOINTED BY MR DUNBAR
I THANK YOU SIR HE SAID FOR YOUR GOOD WILL AND HE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE BUT THE WORDS DIED AWAY UPON HIS LIPS
AND FOR A TIME ENJOYED MY SUCCESS AND THE ADVANTAGES THAT IT BROUGHT ME
IT WAS NOT AN OCCASION UPON WHICH TO BE PUT OFF BY ANY GIRLISH FEAR OF THIS STERN SILENT MAN
NOR COULD I DECLARE THAT I HAD JUDGED OF HER PROFICIENCY AS A TEACHER OF THE PIANO BY THE EXQUISITE LINE OF HER PENCILLED EYEBROWS
BUT THE STORY OF THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS IS ONE OF CHILDHOOD'S SIMPLE LESSONS THAT WE'RE OBLIGED TO REMEMBER IN AFTER-LIFE
HE READ IT SLOWLY ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES--HALF-A-DOZEN TIMES I THINK IN ALL--PUSHING THE FINGERS OF HIS LEFT HAND THROUGH HIS HAIR AS HE READ AND FROWNING AT THE PAPER BEFORE HIM
MR CRICKLEWOOD THE SURGEON
IT ISN'T EVERYBODY THAT HAS THE GOOD LUCK TO BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE HENRY DUNBAR
I HAVE NO POWER OF ASSIMILATION WITH THE CANAILLE
GO TO INDIA
AND THROUGH THE SPACE LEFT BY THAT ONE BUTTON I SAW THE GLITTER OF A GOLD CHAIN WELL WHAT THEN THE OTHER GENTLEMAN MR DUNBAR HAD HIS COAT OPEN AS HE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE AND I SAW AS PLAIN AS EVER I SAW ANYTHING THAT HE HAD NO GOLD-CHAIN
DO YOU THINK I AM SUCH A FOOL AS TO SPEAK OUT BEFORE THE MAN WHO HAS JUST LEFT THIS ROOM
SHE HAS NOTICED SUCH A CHANGE IN YOUR MANNER FOR THE LAST MONTH OR FIVE WEEKS
WHAT A GREEDY INQUISITIVE-LOOKING PALM IT SEEMED
AN AUTHOR
THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME MY LORD AND I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT LIKELY MY FATHER WILL REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE
THE HEIR-AT-LAW WOULD HAVE GNASHED HIS TEETH IN IMPOTENT RAGE HAD HE KNOWN THE CRISIS WHICH CAME TO PASS IN THE BARONET'S LIFE A SHORT TIME AFTER MR DUNBAR'S RETURN FROM INDIA
CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND DAHLIAS GAY-LOOKING CHINA-ASTERS AND ALL THE LINGERING FLOWERS THAT LIGHT UP THE EARLY WINTER LANDSCAPE HAD BEEN COLLECTED TO STREW THE PATHWAY BENEATH THE BRIDE'S PRETTY FEET
IT WAS WITH AN AIR OF SUPREME CARELESSNESS THAT I ASKED MY MOTHER WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN PLEASED WITH MISS WENTWORTH
I FEAR NOT--I FEAR THERE IS NO HOPE WILL IT BE OVER SOON VERY SOON I THINK
BUT WHEN DETECTION CAME IT WAS UPON ME THAT THE DISGRACE AND RUIN FELL
AND I WAS COMPELLED UNDER PAIN OF SOLEMN THREATS FROM MY MOTHER'S PET MEDICAL ATTENDANT TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE TWO OR THREE DAYS REST
THEY WILL BE HERE TO LOOK FOR YOU--HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS HOW SOON THEY
THE RAIN-DROPS FROM THE FADING LEAVES FELL INTO THE STREAMLET FROM WHOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE DEAD MAN'S FACE HAD LOOKED UP TO THE MOONLIT SKY
YOU ARE YOUR OWN SELF STILL I FIND
I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE TO MR DUNBAR MR BALDERBY HESITATED FOR A FEW MOMENTS
FOR IT IS HER NATURE TO BE FEARLESS AND CANDID AS A CHILD
AND HE SAT WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR
THE JURYMEN SYMPATHIZED WITH THE BANKER
THE BROKEN PICTURE
SHE WAS NOT LONG FINDING WHAT SHE WANTED
SO WE BOTH CHERISHED THE THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT GIRL IN OUR MINDS TALKING OF HER CONSTANTLY ON QUIET EVENINGS WHEN WE SAT OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER IN THE SNUG LAMP-LIT DRAWING-ROOM UNHINDERED BY THE PRESENCE OF GUESTS
HE INTERRUPTED THE MAN'S STORY WITH A LONG-DRAWN SIGH IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
HAD HE PASSED HER ON THE ROAD
BUT THEN BEFORE THE LANGUID FOOTMAN COULD RECOVER FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF INDIGNATION AT HER IMPERTINENCE SHE MIGHT SLIP PAST HIM AND REACH THE DOOR LEADING TO THOSE APARTMENTS IN WHICH THE BANKER HID HIMSELF AND HIS GUILT
I UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING NOW
IT SEEMS THAT TWO IRISH REAPERS COMING FROM FARMER MATFIELD'S FIVE MILE BEYOND ST CROSS STUMBLED AGAINST A MAN LYING IN A LITTLE STREAMLET UNDER THE TREES UNDER THE TREES
CLEMENT REMEMBERED WHAT THE DOCTOR HAD SAID OF HIS PATIENT'S IRON WILL
I SENT JOSEPH WILMOT ON TO THE FERNS WITH A MESSAGE FOR MRS MARSTON ASKING AT WHAT HOUR SHE COULD CONVENIENTLY RECEIVE ME TO-DAY
BUT YOU'VE CONTRIVED TO GIVE US THE SLIP
THERE WAS THE SAME WIRE-BLIND BEFORE THE WINDOW THE SAME SOLITARY TREE LEAFLESS IN THE NARROW COURTYARD WITHOUT
THERE COULD BE LITTLE DOUBT THEREFORE THAT THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED FOR THE GREED OF GAIN AND NOT FROM ANY MOTIVE OF REVENGE
YES I HAVE
FOR HE HAD KEPT SO SHARP A WATCH UPON THE LONELY HIGHWAY THAT IT WAS MORE THAN UNLIKELY THE FAMILIAR FIGURE OF HER WHOM HE LOOKED FOR COULD HAVE ESCAPED HIS EAGER EYES
HE LOOKED LIKE SOME GRIM WHITE STATUE THAT HAD DESCENDED FROM ITS PEDESTAL TO STALK HITHER AND THITHER IN THE DARKNESS
PUT A COUPLE OF CANDLES ON THAT WRITING-TABLE AND BRING ME MY DESK THE WAITER OBEYED
THAT FACE WAS AS PALE AS DEATH
BUT WOULD HE NOT BE THE POOREST VILLAIN IF HE SHIRKED THAT ENCOUNTER OF GLANCES WHEN HE KNOWS FULL SURELY THAT HE IS IN THAT MOMENT PUT TO THE TEST
CLEMENT AUSTIN MAKES A SACRIFICE XXXII
HE TALKED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOU WHEN MY FATHER TOLD HIM THAT YOU'D SETTLED AT MAUDESLEY AND WOULD HAVE DRIVEN OVER TO SEE YOU IF HE COULD HAVE MANAGED TO SPARE THE TIME WITHOUT LOSING HIS TRAIN
AN EVIDENCE OF HIS LOVE
THIS CLOSED THE EVIDENCE
SINCE FROM THE CHAIR IN WHICH I HAD SEATED MYSELF TO READ THE EVENING PAPERS I COULD SEE THE ROAD ALONG WHICH MISS WENTWORTH MUST COME
A SERENE STILLNESS REIGNED BENEATH THE SHELTER OF THE SPREADING BRANCHES
KEEP YOURSELF QUIET AND SUBMIT TO THE NECESSITIES OF YOUR ACCIDENT AND YOU'LL RECOVER QUICKLY THE SURGEON TOLD HIS PATIENT
THERE WERE LAURA'S SUDDEN BLUSHES WHICH MADE HER WONDERFUL BEAUTY DOUBLY WONDERFUL
THE SPOT WHICH HE HAD CHOSEN FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS AT THE EXTREME END OF THE PIER WHERE THE WATER WAS DEEPEST
SHE TOLD HIM WITH A GENTLE SORROWFUL ACCENT IN HER VOICE THAT SHE HAD LATELY LOST SOME ONE WHO WAS VERY DEAR TO HER
THE DAY MAY COME WHEN MY DAUGHTER OR MY DAUGHTER'S DESCENDANTS MAY BE OBLIGED TO REALIZE THE JEWELS
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE VERY UNLIKE THE COMMON RUN OF RELATIONS FOR THEY GENERALLY TAKE SUCH THINGS QUIETER THAN ANYBODY ELSE ANSWERED MR CARTER
BRADDON DEDICATION THIS STORY IS INSCRIBED TO JOHN BALDWIN BUCKSTONE ESQ
SHE SUBMITTED AT MRS AUSTIN'S REQUEST
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNEW THE REAL MOTIVE OF HIS CONDUCT FOR TO HIS MOTHER HE SAID VERY LITTLE MORE THAN HE HAD SAID TO MR BALDERBY
HE WILL REFUSE TO SEE ME TO-DAY IF I ASK FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM
NO STRENGTH OF WOMANLY FORTITUDE NO TRUST IN THE MERCY OF GOD COULD EVEN MAKE HER RESIGNED AS TO THAT
THE JURYMEN WERE RANGED UPON EITHER SIDE OF A LONG MAHOGANY TABLE
NO WOMANISH FOLLY SHALL PART US HEAVEN KNOWS IT IS NO WOMAN'S FOLLY THAT PARTS US CLEMENT THE GIRL ANSWERED IN A PLAINTIVE TREMULOUS VOICE
THE TRAIN WAS FAST APPROACHING BASINGSTOKE WHEN JOSEPH WILMOT WAS SUDDENLY STARTLED FROM HIS MOODY REVERIE
AND SHE KNOWS THAT YOU ARE THE WOMAN I SEEK TO WIN AS MY WIFE
YOU MAY JUST AS WELL SPEAK TO A POST AS TO MR DUNBAR
CAN YOU WONDER THEN THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE WAS IN HIS YOUTH
AND HE LOOKED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY OF ST GWENDOLINE'S CHURCH NEAR WHICH MR LOVELL'S HOUSE WAS SITUATED
GO AND TELL MARGARET WILMOT THIS
HE HAD TALKED A GOOD DEAL MAKING HIMSELF VERY FAMILIAR WITH HIS HUMBLE FRIEND
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO I PROMISED TO DO THIS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
THE CONDITION WAS THAT BEFORE HER MARRIAGE WITH CLEMENT AUSTIN TOOK PLACE THE MYSTERY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH SHOULD BE CLEARED UP FOR EVER
THE HUMAN EYE IS A GREAT INSTITUTION
OTHERS WERE YOUNG AND FRIVOLOUS
IT WAS A TOLERABLY FLAT COURSE
NEITHER LAURA NOR HER HUSBAND WILL HAVE ANY REASON FOR DISSATISFACTION
HE WAS LAST SEEN IN MY COMPANY
THERE WERE PACKING-CASES AND PORTMANTEAUS OF ALMOST EVERY SIZE AND SHAPE AND THEY HAD ALL BEEN OPENED BY A MAN-SERVANT WHO WAS KNEELING BY THE LAST WHEN THE BANKER ENTERED THE ROOM
I WAS TO REST AND KEEP MYSELF QUIET SHE SAID AND NOT TO WORRY MYSELF ABOUT PAPERS AND TIRESOME THINGS OF THAT KIND WHICH APPERTAINED ONLY TO THE OFFICE
AND WHEN IT'S ALL OVER WE SHALL ONLY LOOK BACK UPON IT AS THE PASSING OF A BLACK CLOUD OVER OUR LIVES AND YOU WILL SAY THAT I HAVE DONE MY DUTY
BAFFLED XVI
ALWAYS THINKING THINKING THINKING TILL THE ACTION OF HIS BRAIN BECAME AS MECHANICAL AS THAT OF ANY OTHER MACHINE AND WENT ON IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
THEY HAD BEEN SOUTHWARD AND HAD RETURNED TO THE GAYEST CAPITAL IN ALL THE WORLD AT THE TIME WHEN THAT CAPITAL IS AT ITS BEST AND BRIGHTEST
MR BALDERBY HAD RETURNED TO LONDON UPON THE PREVIOUS EVENING BUT ARTHUR LOVELL STILL REMAINED WITH THE ANGLO-INDIAN
I WANT A COMPLETE RIG-OUT CONTINUED JOSEPH WILMOT
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY DIFFERENT THINGS I HAVE FEARED
THAT WAS A PRESENTATION PICTURE BUT THE SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE NEVER PAID UP AND THE COMMITTEE LEFT THE PORTRAIT UPON MY HANDS
THERE ARE NOT MANY BLONDINS EITHER PHYSICAL OR INTELLECTUAL
BUT IF SHE IS IN DISTRESS SHE IS NOT IN DISTRESS MR DUNBAR INTERRUPTED CLEMENT AUSTIN
HE FOUND LAURA STANDING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE SMOOTH LAWN LOOKING ANXIOUSLY OUT TOWARDS THE WINDING GRAVEL-DRIVE THAT LED FROM THE PRINCIPAL LODGE TO THE HOUSE
THE POSTPONEMENT OF THE CORONER'S INQUEST WAS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE LANDLORD OF THE FORESTERS ARMS
YOU YOUNG MEN DON'T APPRECIATE THE TIMES
DOWN WE COMES HERE WITH MORE CHANGES AND BOTHERATION THAN EVER WAS
AND TO THIS DAY SHE DON'T KNOW WHAT MY BUSINESS REALLY IS
A WARWICKSHIRE FARMER WHO HAD FOUND HIS WAY IN AMONG THE KNOWING ONES INFORMED THE MAJOR THAT SIR PHILIP JOCELYN WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED TO MISS DUNBAR ONLY DAUGHTER AND SOLE HEIRESS OF THE GREAT MR DUNBAR
BUT HE CANNOT LONG ESCAPE FROM THE HATEFUL PAST
WHEN YOU EMPLOY A DETECTIVE OFFICER SIR HE BEGAN DON'T EMPLOY A MAN YOU CAN'T PUT ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN
AND UNLESS YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU'D BETTER NOT TRY IT ON MR CARTER GAVE THE BOY SIXPENCE AND DISMISSED HIM
BUT HE LOVED HER AND SHE RETURNED HIS AFFECTION
THEY WERE IRISHMEN REAPERS AND WERE RETURNING FROM A HARVEST SUPPER AT A FARM FIVE MILES FROM ST CROSS UPON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
HIS HAIR WAS WHITE AND HUNG IN LONG THIN LOCKS UPON THE COLLAR OF HIS SHABBY BOTTLE-GREEN GREAT COAT
HE WANTS YOUR DECISION IMMEDIATELY
MARGARET WILMOT FOLLOWED THIS WINDING PATH SLOWLY AND DOUBTFULLY TILL SHE CAME TO THE MARGIN OF A VAST OPEN LAWN
BUT HE STOOD IN THE GOTHIC PORCH WATCHING THE DEPARTING CARRIAGE WITH A KIND OF MOURNFUL TENDERNESS IN HIS FACE
YOU UNDERSTAND OH PERFECTLY ANSWERED MR BALDERBY
IN THOSE TROUBLED DREAMS SHE HAD MET THE RICH MAN PERPETUALLY
HE LOOKED EAGERLY INTO THE CARRIAGE-WINDOWS BUT HE ONLY SAW A CONFUSION OF FLICKERING LAMPLIGHT AND STRANGE FACES AND NEWSPAPERS UNFURLED IN THE HANDS OF WAKEFUL TRAVELLERS AND THE HEADS OF SLEEPY PASSENGERS ROLLING AND JOLTING AGAINST THE PADDED SIDES OF THE CARRIAGE
YOU WILL HAVE TO BEGIN LIFE AFRESH
I POSTED MY LETTER IN A NARROW STREET NEAR THE HOTEL
MY THOUGHTS WERE PLEASANT AS I WALKED ACROSS THE COMMON IN THE SUNSET
AND TO CLEMENT WHO SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD DISCONTINUED HIS SUMMER EVENING WALKS OF LATE MORE ESPECIALLY ON THOSE OCCASIONS ON WHICH HIS NIECE TOOK HE MUSIC-LESSON
HE GOT OUT AND WENT UPON THE PLATFORM
MR DUNBAR HAS HAD A LONG IMMUNITY FROM HIS SINS
THE TWO MEN HAD DRAGGED THE BODY OUT OF THE STREAMLET AND PHILIP MURTOCK HAD WATCHED BESIDE IT WHILE PATRICK HENNESSY HAD GONE TO SEEK ASSISTANCE
JOSEPH WILMOT STOOD AMONG THE LITTLE CROWD MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE WATCHING HIS OLD BETRAYER
SHE STARTED AT THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS ON THE CRISP GRAVEL AND ROSE BLUSHING LIKE ONE OF THE CABBAGE-ROSES THAT GREW NEAR HER
I'VE GOT HIM BY THE BELT HE CAME NEARER TO THE VESSEL STRIKING OUT VIGOROUSLY WITH ONE ARM AND HOLDING SOME BURDEN WITH THE OTHER
CHASING THE CROW XLV
THE DOORS BETWEEN THE INNER AND OUTER HALL WERE AJAR AND THE VOICE WHICH HENRY DUNBAR HEARD WAS THAT OF A WOMAN SPEAKING TO THE PORTER
AND THE JEW WHO DISCOUNTED THESE KNEW THAT
AND SO YOU'VE BEEN BUYING DIAMONDS HE REPEATED PRESENTLY AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE
OH YES IT'S A BARGAIN
THEY CANNOT FAIL TO BE HERE DIRECTLY
THE BANKER SHOOK HIS HEAD
NOR WAS THE LITTLE PARTY WITHOUT AN ESCORT
HE RECEIVED CLEMENT VERY CORDIALLY PUT ON HIS HAT WITHOUT FIVE MINUTES DELAY AND ACCOMPANIED MARGARET'S LOVER BACK TO THE REINDEER
JOSEPH PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW AND CALLED LOUDLY TO A PORTER
WHICH SHOWS HOW VERY LITTLE YOU TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF YOUR NEIGHBOURS ANSWERED MAJOR VERNON FOR IF YOU HAD CONDESCENDED TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF YOUR HUMBLE FRIEND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT HE HAD BOUGHT A COMFORTABLE LITTLE PROPERTY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SETTLED DOWN TO DO THE RESPECTABLE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS NATURAL LIFE--ALWAYS SUPPOSING THAT THE LIBERALITY OF HIS HONOURED FRIEND ENABLES HIM TO DO THE THING DECENTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE BOUGHT PROPERTY IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD YES
THE LANDLORD STILL LINGERED IN ATTENDANCE UPON MR DUNBAR
STRANGLED FROM BEHIND SIR FOR THE SLIP-KNOT WAS PULLED TIGHT AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK
AND THE JURY RETIRED
O GOD
I'LL LOOK UP A FILE OF NEWSPAPERS AND RUN MY EYE OVER THE DETAILS OF THE CASE SAID THE DETECTIVE
SEVEN O'CLOCK EXCLAIMED THE BANKER
THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN THROWN OR HAD FALLEN DOWN VIOLENTLY
BUT I WATCHED IN VAIN
BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT THE LAST MOMENT TO GROWL AT MR DUNBAR
THE PRELIMINARY SKIRMISHING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE HOWEVER
ARTHUR LOVELL AGAIN WATCHED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE INTEREST OF LAURA'S FATHER AND CROSS-EXAMINED SOME OF THE WITNESSES
HE IS PROUD AND HE DESPISES HIS HUMBLE DEPENDANT GOOD NIGHT SAID MR DUNBAR RATHER ABRUPTLY
THEN HE WENT BACK INTO THE DINING-ROOM AND BECKONED TO THE SERVANT WHO WAS WAITING TO PRECEDE HIM UP-STAIRS
THE GENTLEMAN HAD SAID LAUGHING THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS HIS HOUSEMAID AND HE WAS TAKING HER UP TO TOWN ON PURPOSE TO BE MARRIED TO HER
HE WAS ONLY HORROR-STRICKEN BY THE FIRST WHISPER OF DOUBT
I CAN SEE IT ALL NOW
NEVER PAID ME A SIXPENCE AFTERWARDS
BUT HE DID NOT EMPLOY THE TELEGRAPH BY WHICH MEANS HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE EXPEDITED THE ARREST OF HENRY DUNBAR'S MURDERER
HE'S BEEN HERE I SEE--THE QUESTION IS WHAT TIME NOT ABOVE HALF AN HOUR AGO
HE WAS VERY CAREFUL AND WATCHFUL OF HIMSELF IN THAT MATTER--TAKING A SNACK OF BREAD AND COLD MEAT FOR HIS DINNER AND THINKING OF HENRY DUNBAR
AND SOME OF THEM WILL COMMIT ALMOST ANY CRIME FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW POUNDS
I WAS SITTING HERE QUITE IDLE THINKING THINKING OF YOUR FAILURE OF TO-DAY I SUPPOSE YES THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH MARGARET SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE BY THE LITTLE TABLE WHILE CLEMENT AUSTIN WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THINKING
I HAVE HAD SUFFICIENT REST SHE SAID IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE
YOU WOULD TELL ME SO IF YOU KNEW HOW DEARLY I LOVE YOU SHE LIFTED UP HER LIPS AND KISSED HENRY DUNBAR'S IMPASSIBLE FACE
HIS SKETCHES FOR HIS PICTURES THAT WERE TO BE PAINTED UPON SOME FUTURE OCCASION
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY OUT HE OPENED THE DOOR AS HE SPOKE AND POINTED THROUGH A VISTA OF TWO OR THREE ADJOINING ROOMS TO THE HALL
SIR PHILIP WAS QUITE WILLING THAT IT SHOULD BE SO
IF YOU ARE--AS I SUSPECT FROM YOUR MANNER--SOMETHING MORE THAN A FRIEND
THERE'S NOT MANY BEECHES IN THE GROVE THE LAD SAID AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST OF THEM
PHILIP JOCELYN AND HIS BRIDE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO CONVEY THEM BACK TO THE ABBEY
I KNOW THAT HE WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF YOUR RUIN
BUT SHE STARTED PRESENTLY AT THE SOUND OF THAT MANLY FOOTSTEP
I'VE SEEN DARK FACES ENOUGH OUT YONDER
HE COULD ONLY DISTINGUISH THE FAINT OUTLINE OF THE LANDSCAPE AS THE TRAIN SWEPT ON UPON ITS WAY PAST LOW MEADOWS WHERE THE SNOW LAY WHITE AND STAINLESS UNSULLIED BY A PASSING FOOTFALL
BUT I COULD NOT TAKE ANY INTEREST IN HIS CONVERSATION
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM AN OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE EXACT TIME AT WHICH DEATH HAD TAKEN PLACE
YOU'LL FIND THE LUGGAGE PACKED AND DIRECTED TO PORTLAND PLACE
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS THE IMPRESSION WHICH HE MADE UPON THE MIND OF ARTHUR LOVELL WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE ONE
BUT MR CARTER WAS IN TOO MUCH HASTE TO BE AWARE OF THE MAN'S ADMIRATION
YOUR REFUSING TO SEE HER WILL CONFIRM THE SUSPICIONS WHICH WHAT CRIED HENRY DUNBAR
BUT I FEAR I HAVE CHOSEN AN INCONVENIENT TIME FOR MY VISIT I SCARCELY KNOW WHY I MADE THIS APOLOGY SINCE I HAD OMITTED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE OTHER LADIES ON WHOM I HAD VENTURED TO INTRUDE AT ABNORMAL HOURS
HE DRANK A GOOD DEAL OF WINE DURING THE COURSE OF THE DINNER AND HIS SPIRITS ROSE WITH EVERY GLASS
MY FATHER HAS A HEAP OF UNFRAMED CANVASES INCHES THICK IN DUST AND LITTERING EVERY CORNER OF HIS ROOM
AND IF YOU DON'T HELP ME TO PUT AWAY THAT BOTTLE I SHALL TAKE TOO MUCH
AND SHE RAN FROM ONE CANVAS TO ANOTHER LIKE A FICKLE-MINDED BEE THAT IS BEWILDERED BY THE MYRIAD BLOSSOMS OF A BOUNDLESS PARTERRE
MR DUNBAR TOOK A BUNCH OF KEYS FROM HIS POCKET AND UNLOCKED HIS DESPATCH-BOX
NO NO THAT WON'T DO
I WON'T BELIEVE SHE'S ANYTHING BUT WHAT SHE SEEMS--AN ANGEL OF PURITY AND TRUTH BUT SPITE OF HIS BELIEF IN LAURA'S TRUTH THE YOUNG BARONET'S COURAGE WAS VERY LOW WHEN HE WENT INTO THE BLUE DRAWING-ROOM AND FOUND MISS DUNBAR SEATED IN A DEEP EMBAYED WINDOW WITH THE SUNSHINE LIGHTING UP HER HAIR AND GLEAMING AMONGST THE FOLDS OF HER VIOLET SILK DRESS
MR DUNBAR SAYS HE WANTS A LAWYER
WE MAY FAIRLY CONJECTURE THAT OTHELLO'S PASSION FOR THE SIMPLE VENETIAN DAMSEL WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO RESOLUTE SO DEFIANT IN THE RICH MAN'S GAZE THAT IT IS A WONDER THE POOR MAN DID NOT SHRINK FROM ENCOUNTERING IT
AND A STILL LARGER REWARD WAS OFFERED BY MR DUNBAR WHO DECLARED THAT HIS OWN HONOUR AND GOOD NAME WERE IN A MANNER INVOLVED IN THE DISCOVERY OF THE REAL MURDERER
HE GAVE THE MAN A SHILLING FOR HIS INFORMATION AND WENT BACK TO THE FLY THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE STATION
WHEN I FIRST SAW HER AS I STOOD BY THE POST-OFFICE THE MOONLIGHT HAD SHONE FULL UPON HER
FOR HE ADORES HER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES AND HAS PROVED HER TO BE ABOVE ALL DOUBT
HE AWOKE FROM THIS SLUMBER TO HEAR THAT THE WIND HAD CHANGED AND THAT THE PRETTY POLLY_--THE BOAT BELONGING TO THE TWO FISHERMEN WAS CALLED THE PRETTY POLLY_--WAS GAINING ON THE CROW
IT WASN'T THAT HE HELD HIS HEAD HIGHER THAN MR DUNBAR OR THAT HE WAS BETTER DRESSED--FOR MR DUNBAR'S CLOTHES LOOKED THE NEWEST AND BEST
HE WAS IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS AND DRANK A TUMBLER OF STEAMING BRANDY-AND-WATER WITH GREAT GUSTO
THERE IS NEITHER SPARKLE NOR FLAVOUR IN THE CHAMPAGNE THOUGH THE GRAPES THEREOF HAVE BEEN GROWN IN THE VINEYARDS OF WIDOW CLIQUOT HERSELF
HIS FACE WAS VERY GRAVE
FOR I REGRET TO SAY THAT HE IS SLOW TO REMEMBER THE EVENTS OF A FEW DAYS PAST
THERE IS NO REASON THAT I SHOULD DECIDE IN A HURRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID PRESENTLY
THEN HIS CHEST HEAVED AND HE DREW A LONG BREATH LIKE A MAN WHO FEELS ALMOST STIFLED BY SOME INTERNAL OPPRESSION
BUT I SHALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THIS POOR GIRL CLEMENT CONDUCTED MR VINCENT TO THE SITTING-ROOM WHICH WAS EMPTY
BUT YOUR FRIEND CAN SEE THROUGH LESS TRANSPARENT BLINDS THAN THIS DIAMOND BUSINESS
AND I REGRET TO SAY THEY ONLY REPRESENT APART OF THE MONEY WITHDRAWN FROM THE FUNDS IN THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR
BUT BY HEAVEN IF YOU TRY ANY TRICKS WITH ME YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF MISTAKEN
YOU WANT YOUR NEWSPAPERS FILLED WITH PRIZE-FIGHTING AND BOAT-RACING AND THE LAST GOSSIP FROM THE CORNER YOU'LL FIND MISS DUNBAR IN THE BLUE DRAWING-ROOM
OR PERHAPS IT MAY BE THAT THE TIME IN WHICH I LIVE WANTS THE SPICE AND SEASONING OF THAT GOLDEN AGE OF RASCALITY IN WHICH MY LADY CASTLEMAIN'S WHITE PETTICOATS WERE TO BE SEEN FLAUNTING IN THE WIND BY ANY FRIVOLOUS-MINDED LOUNGER WHO CHOSE TO TAKE NOTES ABOUT THOSE GARMENTS
THE FRANK-HEARTED YOUNG COUNTRY GENTLEMAN TRIED IN VAIN TO CONCILIATE HIM OR TO ADVANCE FROM THE COLD OUT-WORK OF CEREMONIOUS ACQUAINTANCESHIP INTO THE INNER STRONGHOLD OF FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE
BUT AS I WAS NOT A SOLDIER AND HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF HANDLING ANY OF THE MAGNIFICENCE IN THE WAY OF DIAMONDS AND SO FORTH I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT THEM THEY WERE IN THE SHADOWY AISLE BY THIS TIME AND MR DUNBAR WAS LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND
SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE PRESENT OWNER OF THE ABBEY NEVER HAD BEEN LIKED AND NEVER WOULD BE LIKED
TO THEM I SEEMED ONLY A GRAVE BUSINESS MAN DEVOTED TO THE DRY DETAILS OF A BUSINESS LIFE
THEY HAVE FOUND THE CLOTHES
A MESSAGE WILL DO JUST AS WELL
THE EVIDENCE OF THIS MAN SAMPSON MIGHT THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THIS MOST MYSTERIOUS EVENT MR DUNBAR THEN TOLD THE REST OF HIS STORY
JOSEPH HE MURMURED I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T GO WITH ME TO SOUTHAMPTON
LIGHTS BLAZED IN THE SPLENDID ROOMS
YOU MAY TRUST TO ME THAT HE SHALL BE FOUND AND SPEEDILY IF HE LIVES IF HE LIVES CRIED LAURA WITH A SUDDEN TERROR IN HER FACE
I RECOLLECT NOW
WAS THERE ANY HOPE THAT SHE WOULD EVER BE MY WIFE
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE LUGGAGE THAT WAS SENT FROM SOUTHAMPTON ASKED THE BANKER
AND THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSHINE IS AFTER ALL ONLY A DECEPTIVE RADIANCE WHEN COMPARED TO THE FULL GLORY OF JULY
WE'VE FOUND EM
HUSBANDS PARTED FROM THEIR WIVES
HE WENT AWAY WITH THE DETERMINATION OF DISCOVERING THE SICK MAN SAMPSON WILMOT
JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NOT COME BACK FROM THE FERNS
BY THE BYE I HEARD YOUR WINES VERY WELL SPOKEN OF THE OTHER DAY BY A PERSON OF SOME IMPORTANCE TOO--OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE I MAY SAY INDEED SIR MURMURED THE WAITER WHO WAS STANDING AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FROM THE TABLE AND WAS SIPPING HIS WINE WITH DEFERENTIAL SLOWNESS
FURTHER REMITTANCES WILL BE SENT TO HER AT SHORT INTERVALS
I SHALL NOT DINE TILL MR WILMOT WHO IS MY OLD CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT--MY FRIEND I MAY SAY--RETURNS HAS HE GONE FAR SIR TO THE FERNS ABOUT A MILE BEYOND ST CROSS
I SAW THAT MARGARET WILMOT'S CONDUCT WAS QUITE AS INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AS IT HAD BEEN TO ME
I CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT MURDER WILL OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER SOONER OR LATER
HE WAS SO DEEPLY ABSORBED BY HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAT HE WAS QUITE STARTLED PRESENTLY WHEN A YOUNG MAN CAME CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ADDRESSED HIM EAGERLY
MY DARLING HE SAID COME INTO THE PARLOUR
THEN HE WENT TO BED
HOW HENRY DUNBAR WAITED DINNER
BUT HER FACE NEVER LIGHTED UP NOW WITH A BRIGHT LOOK OF PLEASURE
AND YOU THINK THAT THE SHAME OF THAT SECRET IS A BURDEN WHICH I WOULD FEAR TO CARRY
SHE SPENT DAY AFTER DAY IN HAPPY IDLENESS--READING SKETCHING PLAYING SINGING TALKING SOMETIMES GAILY SOMETIMES SERIOUSLY TO HER FAITHFUL OLD NURSE OR TO DORA OR TO ARTHUR LOVELL AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
THERE WAS THE HEAD OF AN ECCLESIASTIC CUT FROM A LARGE PICTURE BY SPAGNOLETTI
HE TOOK HIS TICKET FOR SOUTHAMPTON AS SOON AS THE OFFICE WAS OPEN AND THEN STOOD ON THE PLATFORM WHERE THERE WERE TWO OR THREE STRAGGLERS WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO COME UP
IT WAS CRUEL DASTARDLY INFAMOUS FROM THAT DAY MARGARET I WAS A RUINED MAN
HE HAD OFTEN BEEN HER GUEST
IN THOSE FEW WORDS HE HAD REVEALED THE SECRET OF HIS HEART
YOU SEEM CONTENTED AND MOST HAPPY THOUGH THE MONOTONOUS LIFE YOU LEAD WOULD DRIVE SOME WOMEN MAD
THERE WAS A PAUSE DURING WHICH THE LISTENER WAITED WITH AN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
I WANT BRIGHT LOOKS MAN TO WELCOME ME BACK TO MY NATIVE COUNTRY
YES THIS DECIDES IT
BEWILDERED THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHY
NOT BECAUSE SHE WENT INTO ANY RIDICULOUS SENTIMENTAL RAPTURES ABOUT IT AS SOME GIRLS DO BUT BECAUSE HER EYES LIGHTED UP WHEN SHE TOLD ME WHAT A HAPPINESS HER PIANO HAD BEEN TO HER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD
I'LL GO UP TO THE HOUSE AND SEE THE LADY MR CARTER FOUND THE DOOR OPEN AND A GROUP OF SERVANTS CLUSTERED IN THE GOTHIC PORCH
SHE HAS PAID THE PENALTY OF HER DETERMINATION TO FORCE HERSELF INTO THE PRESENCE OF HENRY DUNBAR
WHILE THE DETECTIVE SMACKED HIS LIPS AND KNOWINGLY DELIBERATED OVER HIS FIRST GLASS OF PORT
AND BY THE TIME CLEMENT AUSTIN REACHED HOME HE--LIKE MARGARET WILMOT AND LIKE ARTHUR LOVELL--SUSPECTED THE MILLIONAIRE
SHE HAS LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THAT MISERABLE PAST
AND SUSTAINED BY THESE INWARD AND OUTWARD FORTIFICATIONS AGAINST THE CHILLING AIRS OF THE LONG NIGHT HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN A CORNER OF THE SECOND-CLASS CARRIAGE AND MADE THE BEST OF HIS SITUATION
I WEAR A LEATHER BELT NEXT MY FLANNEL WAISTCOAT MR DUNBAR SAID AS THE TWO MEN WERE UNDRESSING HIM
YOU SET OUT THIS AFTERNOON UPON SOME MYSTERIOUS EXPEDITION WITH MARGARET
BUT THAT IS AN AFTER CONSIDERATION
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S JOURNAL CONTINUED
LISTENING
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT LONG
A FAINT GLOW OF CRIMSON FIRELIGHT REDDENED THE GRAVEL-DRIVE BEFORE THE WINDOWS OF MR DUNBAR'S APARTMENTS AND THERE WAS A FOOTMAN AIRING HIMSELF UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE PORCH WITH A GLIMMER OF LIGHT SHINING OUT OF THE HALL BEHIND HIM
AS FOR THE INCESSANT RAIN THAT WAS NOTHING TO HIM
WHAT OF THAT LAURA DEAR SHE ASKED VERY INNOCENTLY
I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS YOU MY DEAR HE SAID
AND ALL THIS TIME WITH HER MIND RACKED BY ANXIOUS THOUGHTS THE GIRL WENT ABOUT THE WEARY DUTIES OF HER DAILY LIFE
YOU KNOW WHERE MR DUNBAR HAS GONE SAID MR CARTER LOOKING STILL MORE SHARPLY AT THE GENTLEMAN IN THE EASY-CHAIR
BUT SHE FOUND THAT ALL HER EFFORTS TO DO THIS WERE WORSE THAN USELESS
I AM NOT A DEMONSTRATIVE MAN AND I HAVE NEVER MADE ANY GREAT FUSS ABOUT MY LOVE FOR MY DAUGHTER
I'LL GO AND SEE MY OLD FRIEND MICHAEL MARSTON
WANDSWORTH COMMON WAS AS LONELY THIS EVENING AS A PATCH OF SAND IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA
FOR I HAVEN'T MADE MUCH OF A BREAKFAST MYSELF
WELL WE COME TO DERBY AND THE FURRY GENT HE TAKES A TICKET ON TO HULL
NOW THAT I CAN THINK COOLLY OF THE BUSINESS I KNOW THAT SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE IS IMPOSSIBLE
YOU'VE GIVEN ME TWO THOU HE SAID
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE SIR
SHE GOES AND SCRAPES HERSELF ALONG THE PASSAGE-WALL AND SHUDDERS AND SHIVERS AND SAYS I'M A WRETCH
COME DEAR ONCE MORE HE APPROACHED HER AND AGAIN SHE SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM DRAGGING HERSELF ALONG AGAINST THE WALL AND WITH HER EYES STILL FIXED IN THE SAME DEATHLIKE STARE
WHY THERE'S A SHIP-LOAD OF CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS GOES OUT TO VAN DIEMEN'S LAND EVERY QUARTER AND RESERVED SPECIALLY FOR YOUNG FEMALES OH
DON'T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK GIRL I FEAR I CAN GUESS IT FATHER DEAR SHE MURMURED IN A LOW VOICE
IT WAS HALF-PAST SIX WHEN WE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WE HAD KEPT DINNER WAITING HALF AN HOUR MUCH TO THE REGRET OF THE MOST COURTEOUS OF WAITERS WHO EXPRESSED INTENSE ANXIETY ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE FISH
STILL AFTER CAREFULLY SIFTING THE EVIDENCE OF THE CORONER'S INQUEST HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS INNOCENT OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DEATH
I REQUIRE THOSE WITH ME
HE RECOGNIZED THE BANKER WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HIM AND TAKING OFF HIS HAT ADDRESSED MR DUNBAR RESPECTFULLY
NO TAINT OF VICE OR DISSIPATION HAD EVER SULLIED THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS PLEASANT LIFE
HE HURRIED OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR AND SHUT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BEHIND HIM
AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO BLAME THE MURKY HEAVENS FOR ANY CHANGE IN HIS TEMPER
THERE WAS A PORTER ASLEEP UPON HIS TRUCK ON THE PLATFORM AND THERE WAS ONE SOLITARY YOUNG FEMALE SITTING UPON A BENCH AGAINST THE WALL WITH HER BOXES AND BUNDLES GATHERED ROUND HER AND AN UMBRELLA AND A PAIR OF CLOGS ON HER LAP
TO-DAY IS THE 23RD OF AUGUST AND I SEE BY THE SHIPPING GAZETTE THAT THE ORONOKO SAILS ON THE 10TH OF SEPTEMBER
HIS ERECT FIGURE THE CARRIAGE OF HIS HEAD HIS DASHING NAY ALMOST SWAGGERING WALK ALL BELONGED TO A MAN IN THE PRIME OF MIDDLE AGE
THEN I SUMMON UP COURAGE AND GO TO HIS DREARY ROOMS
WHAT IF JOSEPH WILMOT WAS THE VICTIM AND NOT THE MURDERER IN THAT CASE I SHALL SOON DISCOVER MY MISTAKE
IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS MAN
HE CALLED AGAIN ON THE MORNING OF THE 19TH
HE WAS A TRAVELLER IN BIRMINGHAM JEWELLERY HE TOLD THE LAND LADY OF THE QUIET LITTLE INN AND WAS ON HIS WAY TO THAT BUSY COMMERCIAL CENTRE TO PROCURE A FRESH SUPPLY OF GLASS EMERALDS AND A SCORE OR SO OF GIGANTIC RUBIES WITH CRINKLED TINSEL BEHIND THEM
AND I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DO THAT
HE HAD GLADLY SEIZED UPON THE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY THIS VISIT TO THE TOWN HOUSE
EVERYTHING HERE WAS NEW TO HIM
YOU'LL KEEP ALL SAFE HERE SAWNEY WHILE I GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPASS MR CARTER ENGAGED A FLY AND MADE HIS WAY TO A PIER AT THE END OF THE TOWN WHENCE A BOAT TOOK HIM ACROSS THE HUMBER TO A STATION ON THE LINCOLNSHIRE SIDE OF THE RIVER
BUT WHEN HIS HAND WAS ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT MR HENRY DUNBAR
IF IT WERE THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOVE AND JUSTICE JAMES WENTWORTH LAUGHED SNEERINGLY
YOU'D BEST HAVE SOMETHING TO COVER YOU BESIDES WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON SIR THE FISHERMAN SAID
BUT HE HAS BEEN MURDERED BY HENRY DUNBAR THERE WAS NO SHADOW OF DOUBT NOW IN HER MIND
NO INDEED MR DUNBAR SAID THAT HE DID THEN I WILL GO AWAY
AND YET I KNOW SO LITTLE OF HER
AND I'M GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND SIR THAT WHEN THESE YOUNG MEN'S WORKS ARE EXHIBITED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY IN LONDON SIR PEOPLE CROWD ROUND THEM AND GO RAVING MAD ABOUT THEM
ANY RELATION TO I AM THE DAUGHTER OF JOSEPH WILMOT ANSWERED MARGARET QUIETLY
I AM TWELVE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU MARGARET AND THERE IS NOTHING VERY ROMANTIC OR INTERESTING EITHER IN MYSELF OR MY WORLDLY POSITION
BUT IT WAS ONLY TOO LIKELY THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN THE VERY EVE OF HER OWN AND HER FATHER'S DEPARTURE FOR SOME DISTANT COUNTRY AS THE MOST FITTING TIME AT WHICH TO LEAVE THE VALUABLE PARCEL WITH ME
BUT HE DREW A LITTLE WAY BEHIND HIS MASTER AS HE DID SO
A LOVELY PARADISE A MODERN EDEN RADIANT WITH THE REFLECTED LIGHT THAT IT RECEIVED FROM THE FACE OF A WOMAN
DEPEND UPON IT THE DANISH PRINCE HAD WATCHED OPHELIA CLOSELY AND KNEW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THAT YOUNG LADY'S TEMPER AND HAD LAID CONVERSATIONAL TRAPS FOR HER OCCASIONALLY I DARE SAY TRYING TO ENTICE HER INTO SOME BIT OF TOADYISM THAT SHOULD BETRAY ANY LATENT TAINT OF FALSEHOOD INHERITED FROM POOR TIME-SERVING POLONIUS
I KNOW THAT FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR THE GRATING SOUND OF THE IRON DRAGS GRINDING ON THE GRAVELLY BED OF THE STREAM SOUNDED IN MY TIRED EARS AND YET THERE WAS NO RESULT
MAY I ASK IF YOU ARE VERY FOND OF HIM
THEN MY MAN OUGHT TO BE BACK IN AN HOUR'S TIME HE SAID
AND HE SELDOM FINISHED HIS LETTER WITHOUT SAYING THAT HE LOOKED JOYFULLY FORWARD TO OUR MEETING
COME LOVELL ARTHUR LOVELL SHOOK HANDS WITH LAURA MURMURED A FEW WORDS IN HER EAR AND HURRIED AWAY WITH MR BALDERBY
MR DUNBAR WAS SITTING IN A LUXURIOUS EASY-CHAIR WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING ACROSS HIS KNEE
BUT THEY COME FASTEST WHEN A FELLOW SITS TWIRLING HIS THUMBS
BY SOME INEXPLICABLE MEANS BY SOME MASTERPIECE OF VILLANY AND CUNNING THIS MAN HAS INDUCED HIS VICTIM'S DAUGHTER TO BECOME THE CHAMPION OF HIS INNOCENCE INSTEAD OF THE DENOUNCER OF HIS GUILT
BUT SHE CONTROLLED HER AGITATION BY A GREAT EFFORT AND WENT SLOWLY ON TO THE NEXT ROOM
YES MR DUNBAR
BUT YOUR FUTURE FAVOURS--AS THOSE LOW FELLOWS THE BUTCHERS AND BAKERS HAVE IT--ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED FOR YOURS TRULY
BUT THE EVIDENCE OF THE IDENTITY WAS CONSIDERED CONCLUSIVE BY ALL WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION
OH YES I AM QUITE AWARE OF THAT MR DUNBAR ANSWERED COOLLY
I SHALL BE IN AGAIN IN AN HOUR'S TIME HE SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT GO OUT IMMEDIATELY
MR CARTER LOOKED VERY SHARPLY AT THE GENTLEMAN SITTING IN THE EASY-CHAIR
HE ONLY PAUSED NOW AND THEN TO TAKE PENCIL-NOTES OF ITS CONTENTS IN A LITTLE MEMORANDUM-BOOK WHICH HE CARRIED IN THE BREAST-POCKET OF HIS COAT
BUT TO HIS SURPRISE IT WAS COLD AS ICE
AND MISS LAURA DUNBAR WAS LOUNGING IN A LOW EASY-CHAIR NEAR A BROAD WINDOW THAT OPENED INTO A CONSERVATORY FILLED WITH EXOTICS THAT MADE THE AIR HEAVY WITH THEIR ALMOST OVERPOWERING PERFUME
UNSET DIAMONDS ARE AN EMINENTLY PORTABLE SPECIES OF PROPERTY AND YOU MIGHT CARRY A TOLERABLY VALUABLE COLLECTION OF THEM IN THE FOLDS OF THE SMALLEST PARASOL THAT EVER FADED UNDER THE SUMMER SUNSHINE IN THE LADY'S MILE
BUT AS NOBODY EXCEPT ONE VERY WEAK-WITTED FEMALE JOCELYN HAD EVER SEEN THE VISION THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE UPON THE CRAG HAD TAKEN SO LITTLE HEED OF THE LEGEND THAT THE DATE OF THE ANNIVERSARY HAD COME AT LAST TO BE FORGOTTEN
IF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO THINK THAT HENRY DUNBAR IS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT THEY ARE WELCOME TO THEIR OPINION
BUT THIS IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH MR BALDERBY
A DREARY COTTAGE LOOKING OUT ON THE FLAT SHORE HALF SAND HALF MUD AND THE LOW WATER LYING IN GREENISH POOLS
THERE WAS A MYSTERY AND HENRY DUNBAR WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIS PROMISE
AT FIVE MINUTES AFTER TWO HE ALIGHTED AT THE STATION WHERE HE PAID AND DISMISSED THE DRIVER
THERE COULD BE NO OTHER JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH AN INTRUSION
MR DUNBAR THE BANKER TURNED SHARPLY ROUND AND RECOGNIZED ARTHUR LOVELL
HE WAS VERY MUCH ESTEEMED BY MR CARTER NEVERTHELESS
NO MATTER WHAT IF IT PUTS A FEW SHILLINGS INTO MY POCKET I'D RATHER YOU STAYED AT HOME FATHER DEAR MARGARET SAID GENTLY
HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TAKE LIQUIDS IN A BOILING STATE AS THE GREATER PART OF HIS EXISTENCE WAS SPENT IN HURRYING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS HE WAS HURRYING NOW
HE WAS JUST GOING TO STEP INTO IT WHEN A HAND TOUCHED HIM LIGHTLY ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING SHARPLY AND ANGRILY ROUND HE RECOGNIZED THE GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF MAJOR VERNON
THE BANKER TURNED AWAY FROM HIM WITH A MUTTERED OATH
A DEED THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DONE BY A MAN OF UNFALTERING RESOLUTION AND IRON NERVE
PERHAPS YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME FRANKLY WHY YOU WANT TO LEAVE US I REGRET TO SAY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO SO SIR REPLIED THE CASHIER
IT IS SELDOM LOCKED TILL FOUR O'CLOCK
HE HAD PITIED HER BECAUSE OF HER HARD LIFE HER LONELINESS HER BEAUTY WHICH DOUBTLESS EXPOSED HER TO MANY DANGERS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED TO A PLAIN WOMAN
YES MARGARET SAID
THE ELECTRA WAS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL TO-MORROW I WILL GO ON TO THE DOLPHIN THEN RETURNED MR DUNBAR
IT WAS ALWAYS FRESH FILLED EVERY DAY HOW LONG DOES IT BURN TEN HOURS WHEN WAS IT LIGHTED A LITTLE BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK MR CARTER REMOVED THE GLASS SHADE AND CARRIED THE LAMP TO THE FIREPLACE
THERE WAS A DESK NEAR THE WINDOW AT WHICH A GENTLEMAN WITH VERY BLACK HAIR AND WHISKERS WAS SEATED BUSILY ENGAGED IN SOME ABSTRUSE CALCULATIONS BETWEEN A PAIR OF OPEN LEDGERS
BUT MINGLED WITH THAT SOFT AND WOMANLY DISPOSITION THERE WAS MUCH OF THE FATHER'S DETERMINATION MUCH OF THE STRONG MAN'S FORCE OF INTELLECT AND RESOLUTE WILL
AND WHO ENABLED HER TO EARN MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR HER SIMPLE WANTS
ARTHUR LOVELL WENT OFTEN TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY
WAS THIS LAMP FILLED LAST NIGHT HE ASKED
THE SMOOTH BEADS OF WATER RAN OFF THE SHINING LAUREL-LEAVES
HIS EARS WERE STRAINED TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MARGARET'S FOOTSTEP IN THE CORRIDOR WITHOUT
BUT SHE DID NOT TREMBLE NOW
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING HE CALLED AGAIN UPON MR DUNBAR AND BEGGED THAT AN EARLY DATE MIGHT BE CHOSEN FOR THE WEDDING
HE MAY HAVE DROPPED INTO SOME ROADSIDE PUBLIC-HOUSE AND BE SITTING BOOZING AMONGST A LOT OF COUNTRY FELLOWS AT THIS MOMENT
AND THEN THE TWO MEN TALKED TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES ON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS
I HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING WALKING FROM PLACE TO PLACE UNTIL I COULD DROP ON THE FLOOR AT YOUR FEET
THIS WAS THE ONE POINT WHICH FROM FIRST TO LAST HAD COMPLETELY BAFFLED ME
BUT HE GOT UP AND TOOK HIS HAT FROM A SIDE-TABLE NEAR THE DOOR
IF HE DID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL DIFFERENT LONG AGO--WHEN I TRIED TO BE HONEST YES THIS WAS TRUE
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR CLAPPING OF HANDS HE SAYS OR FOR ANYTHING BUT SORROW THAT SUCH A WICKED DEED HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT THE CRUEL WRETCH AS DID IT SHOULD ESCAPE
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THESE HE SAID
SO I HAVEN'T HAD MY LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING THE DETECTIVE TRIED TO FASTEN HIS OTHER HAND ON MR VALLANCE'S SHOULDER
HIS ESTABLISHMENT WAS COMPOSED OF THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD WAITED ON THE DECEASED ADMIRAL AND A YOUNG MAN-OF-ALL-WORK WHO WAS NEPHEW TO THE HOUSEKEEPER AND WHO HAD ALSO BEEN IN THE SERVICE OF THE LATE OWNER OF THE COTTAGE
FOR HE WAS THINKING THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD PERHAPS SUSPECT MR DUNBAR HIMSELF AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WELL FOR HIM TO REMAIN UPON THE SCENE OF THE MURDER UNTIL THAT SUSPICION SHOULD BE DONE AWAY WITH BY THE ARREST OF THE REAL MURDERER
IF I AM ANY JUDGE OF HUMAN NATURE HENRY DUNBAR WILL HATE US BECAUSE OF THAT VERY CRIME OF HIS OWN KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN THE SECRET AND WILL BE ALL THE MORE DISAGREEABLE AND DISDAINFUL IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH US
SHE IS A VERY RESPECTABLE-LOOKING PERSON SIR HE SAID
AND SCATTERED ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX AMONGST LOOSE SHREDS OF TOBACCO--BROKEN LUMPS OF PETRIFIED CAVENDISH--AND SCRAPS OF PAPER THERE WERE A FEW LETTERS
BUT I SUPPOSE HE GOT A REMISSION OF HIS SENTENCE OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND AND RETURNED TO ENGLAND I HAD NO IDEA OF THIS SAID MR DUNBAR
THE CORONER WHO WAS A FUSSY LITTLE MAN VERY READILY ACCEDED TO MR DUNBAR'S ENTREATIES
AS I AM IN LISFORD,--AND TO BE CANDID WITH YOU LISFORD'S ABOUT THE DULLEST PLACE IT WAS EVER MY BAD LUCK TO VISIT,--WHY I'LL STAY AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS WEDDING
MANY WHO SEEMED OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE DEMANDED A HIGHER RATE OF REMUNERATION THAN WE WERE PREPARED TO GIVE
AND THAT ALL INFORMATION RESPECTING THE SAME WAS TO BE OBTAINED OF MR HOGSON GROCER LISFORD
HE WORE THE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT BUCKLED TIGHTLY ROUND HIS WAIST NEXT TO HIS INNER SHIRT AND WAS ABLE TO DEFY THE SWELL-MOB HAD THOSE GENTRY BEEN AWARE OF THE TREASURES WHICH HE CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM
I HAD NOT DARED TO ATTEMPT ANY INTERPOSITION BETWEEN JOSEPH WILMOT AND THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS CRIME
AS TO THE ROBBERY OF THE CLOTHES--THE RIFLING OF THE POCKETBOOK--THAT OF COURSE WAS ONLY A PART OF HENRY DUNBAR'S DEEP LAID SCHEME
THE SMOOTH BROWN HAIR RIPPLING UPON THE WHITE FOREHEAD WHICH WAS LOW AND BROAD WAS OF A COLOUR WHICH A DUCHESS MIGHT HAVE ENVIED OR AN EMPRESS TRIED TO IMITATE WITH SUBTLE DYES COMPOUNDED BY COURT CHEMISTS
QUIET OLD FELLOW JOSEPH SAID IN A WHISPER
I HAD BEEN ABOUT TO ASK FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MUSIC-MISTRESS BUT I HAD NO NEED TO DO SO NOW
I WILL SEE HER THEN ARTHUR LOVELL CARRIED THIS MESSAGE TO MARGARET
I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO BELIEVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAS BEEN GUILTY OF THIS FEARFUL CRIME
THESE WERE THE THOUGHTS THAT TORMENTED ME DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT AFTER MY RETURN FROM THE MISERABLE JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER
AND THANKS TO HIM I'VE GOT THE SWEETEST TRUEST BRIGHTEST GIRL THAT EVER LIVED
I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT I HAVE FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO TRACE MARGARET YOU DON'T MEAN IT I'VE FOUND THE NAME OF A TOWN WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS STAYING BEFORE SHE BROUGHT THOSE DIAMONDS TO ME
BUT BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE FOR INDIA HAD YOU ANY MISUNDERSTANDING ANY SERIOUS QUARREL WITH THE DECEASED MR DUNBAR'S FACE FLUSHED SUDDENLY AND HIS BROWS CONTRACTED AS IF EVEN HIS SELF-POSSESSION WERE NOT PROOF AGAINST THE UNPLEASANT MEMORIES OF THE PAST
I'LL KEEP MY EYE UPON THE OLD FELLOW AT ANY RATE SAMPSON WILMOT HAD ARRIVED AT THE STATION ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE STARTING OF THE TRAIN
HE MEANS A BOLT
OH WAS I IN LOVE WAS I REALLY IN LOVE AT LAST WITH A YOUNG LADY WHOSE FACE I HAD ONLY LOOKED UPON EIGHT-AND-FORTY HOURS BEFORE
THE MOTIVE'S AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT HE WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN HE LAID HIS HAND HEAVILY UPON HIS COMPANION'S SHOULDER PUT HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE BANKER'S EAR AND SAID IN A LOUD VOICE FOR IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD ABOVE THE JOLTING OF THE CAB HENRY DUNBAR YOU'RE A VERY CLEVER FELLOW AND I DARE SAY YOU THINK YOURSELF A GREAT DEAL SHARPER THAN I AM
SO LAURA AND HER HUSBAND ASCENDED THE STAIRS WHICH WERE BARE OF ANY COVERING EXCEPT DIRT AND WENT ON MOUNTING THROUGH COMPARATIVE DARKNESS PAST THE OFFICE OF THE PARISIAN JOURNAL TILL THEY CAME TO A VERY DINGY BLACK DOOR
FOR THE SNOW HAD BEEN FALLING ALL THROUGH THE LAST THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS AND LAY DEEP ON THE GROUND HIDING THE LOW THATCHED ROOFS AND MAKING FEATHERY FESTOONS ABOUT THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES UNTIL LISFORD LOOKED LIKE A VILLAGE UPON THE TOP OF A TWELFTH-CAKE
THE MAN WHOM I HAD SEEN AND SPOKEN WITH WAS NOT HENRY DUNBAR THEN BUT JOSEPH WILMOT THE MURDERER OF HIS MASTER--THE TREACHEROUS AND DELIBERATE ASSASSIN OF THE MAN HE HAD GONE TO MEET AND WELCOME AFTER HIS FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS ABSENCE FROM ENGLAND
THE DELAY ATTENDANT UPON EVERY FRESH STOPPAGE WORRIED HIM AS IF THE PAUSE HAD BEEN THE WEARY INTERVAL OF AN HOUR
IS MY LOVE HOPELESS I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE MR AUSTIN MARGARET ANSWERED IN A LOW VOICE
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND TAKE NOTES MR AUSTIN
WHO IS THERE HE CRIED IMPATIENTLY
IF THIS MAN WAS GUILTY HIS CRIME HAD BEEN DELIBERATELY PLANNED AND EXECUTED WITH SUCH A DIABOLICAL CUNNING THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE SO FAR TO ESCAPE DETECTION
BUT I HAD MY OWN WAY AND WENT INTO THE LITTLE ROOM WHERE THERE WERE FLOWERS BLOOMING AND CAGED BIRDS SINGING IN THE OPEN WINDOW
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE LAURA ASKED THIS QUESTION VERY HOPEFULLY
I CAN SEE BY YOUR FACE THAT HE HAS WELL HE HAVE THEN ANSWERED MR TIBBLES IN AN INJURED TONE
AND IF UPON CONSIDERATION I FIND THAT ONE OF THEM WILL SUIT ME I WILL COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
THIS YOUNG PERSON CAN HAVE NO POSSIBLE MOTIVE FOR WISHING TO SEE ME
THE HOUSE STOOD UPON A ROCKY CLIFF BENEATH WHICH RUSHED A CASCADE THAT LEAPT FROM CRAG TO CRAG AND FELL INTO THE BOSOM OF A DEEP STREAM THAT FORMED AN ARM OF THE RIVER AVON
SHE READ THE NEWSPAPER RECORD OF THE CRUEL DEED THAT HAD BEEN DONE--TWICE--SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY
HE WAS VERY EXTRAVAGANT IN ALL HIS WAYS
THE GIRL WENT INTO THE LITTLE RUSTIC PORCH WITH HIM AND DIRECTED HIM TO THE ROSE AND CROWN AT LISFORD
FOR I DO LOVE YOU CLEMENT WITH ALL MY HEART CHAPTER XXVIII
THEN HAVING GIVEN THE MAGISTRATE THE ADDRESS OF HER WANDSWORTH LODGING SHE BADE HIM GOOD MORNING AND WENT OUT INTO THE UNFAMILIAR STREET
SOMETIMES WHOLE DAYS PASS DURING WHICH I DO NOT SEE HIM
HAS ALL THE WORLD CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY
IT WOULD BE SWEET TO ME TO KEEP HER HERE HE THOUGHT
BUT IT WAS NOT THE LESS THE MOST CHARMING CITY IN THE UNIVERSE
THE WORLD WOULD SHRINK AWAY PERHAPS FROM THE MURDERER'S DAUGHTER
HE MAY MARRY AGAIN AND HAVE A SON TO INHERIT HIS WEALTH
THE THIRD CARRIAGE WAITED FOR HENRY DUNBAR AND THE CROWD IN THE CHURCHYARD WAITED TO SEE HIM GET INTO IT
MARGARET I WROTE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT WHICH ADORNED THE SECOND COLUMN OF THE TIMES SUPPLEMENT ON TWENTY CONSECUTIVE OCCASIONS I HOLD YOU TO YOUR OLD PROMISE AND CONSIDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR PARTING AS IN NO MANNER A RELEASE FROM YOUR OLD ENGAGEMENT
SHE WAS USED TO LUXURY AND ELEGANCE
HE DID NOT LIKE HENRY DUNBAR
PHILIP INQUIRED IN FRENCH FOR THE SENIOR MR KERSTALL
BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE EITHER IN HER FACE OR ATTITUDE AND THE YOUNG MAN WENT SLOWLY AND SORROWFULLY FROM THE ROOM
AND I HOPE IT MAY BE THE LAST THE ELDERLY WAITER WHO REMEMBERED THE COACHING DAYS AND PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT THE REINDEER WAS NOT AN INSTITUTION OF THE PAST CAME IN PRESENTLY WITH THE FIRST COURSE
HE WORE IT UNDER HIS SHIRT AND WAS ALWAYS FIDGETY IN CHANGING HIS SHIRT AND DIDN'T SEEM TO WANT YOU TO SEE THE BELT
DORA MACMAHON WAS SITTING NEAR HER WITH AN OPEN BOOK BY THE SIDE OF HER BREAKFAST-CUP
PERHAPS NOT HE SAID
BUT SHE HAD THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE POWER OF ENJOYMENT WHICH IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST GIFTS OF A FRESH YOUNG NATURE
FROM THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH HE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE DEAD MAN'S PROPERTY UNTIL THIS MOMENT HE HAD LIVED IN PERPETUAL TERROR OF THE CRISIS WHICH HAD NOW ARRIVED
HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE THOUGHT OTHERWISE
HERE IS MY PURSE
IT WAS ONLY AFTERWARDS THAT THESE THINGS CAME BACK TO MY MIND AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT THEM VERY STRANGE WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING
HENRY DUNBAR SAW THE LOOK AND IT SEEMED AS IF HE ENDEAVOURED TO ANSWER IT
JOSEPH WILMOT WAITED PATIENTLY ENOUGH IN ALL OUTWARD SEEMING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE STEAMER
WHICH IS ONLY AN ELEGANT WAY OF SAYING LET BYGONES BE BYGONES AND SO YOU'VE BEEN BUYING DIAMONDS DEAR BOY WHO TOLD YOU SO YOU DID WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF MR ISAAC HARTGOLD'S ESTABLISHMENT
AND HE SAT ALONE LATE INTO THE NIGHT DRINKING HEAVILY ACCORDING TO THE REPORT CURRENT IN THE SERVANTS HALL
ALWAYS ON CONDITION THAT SHE DOES NOT INTRUDE HERSELF UPON ME
I HAVE FEARED TO TELL YOU THAT WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE DISCOVERED FOR YOURSELF HAD YOU NOT BEEN AS INNOCENT AS YOUR OWN PET DOVES IN THE DOVECOTE AT MAUDESLEY THE GIRL LOOKED AT HIM WITH WONDERING EYES THAT WERE STILL WET WITH UNSHED TEARS
NO HE'LL NOT DO THAT HE SAID
BUT SHE RECOILED FROM HIM FOR THE SECOND TIME WITH A SHUDDER AND A LONG-DRAWN SHIVERING SIGH
ACTUALLY VERY LITTLE MORE THAN BOYS SIR
I HAD NOT WALKED HALF A MILE BEFORE I WAS JOINED BY THE DETECTIVE
HE SENT FOR HIS ASSISTANT
THE DETECTIVE SEIZED THIS GENTLEMAN BY THE FUR COLLAR OF HIS COAT AND SHOOK HIM ROUGHLY
MY MOTHER IS A CLEVER WOMAN AND I KNOW THAT SHE HAS A MOST SINCERE REGARD FOR YOU
I'M REALLY AFRAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
NOW CREEPING FROM THE DARKNESS WITH A MURMURING VOICE AND STEALTHY GLIDING MOTION TO CHANGE ITS VERY NATURE AND BECOME THE NOISIEST BROOK THAT EVER BABBLED OVER SUNLIT PEBBLES ON ITS WAY TO THE BLUE SEA
MEANWHILE MARGARET WILMOT LIVED ALONE IN HER SIMPLE COUNTRIFIED LODGING AND THOUGHT SADLY ENOUGH OF THE FATHER WHOM SHE HAD LOST
BUT HE PAINTED AS RECKLESSLY AS HE RODE
BY ONE HIDEOUS DEED BOTH PASSIONS WERE GRATIFIED
I TOLD HIM TO COME ON TO ME HERE
THE CASHIER COMMUNICATED WITH THE DETECTIVE POLICE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE CASE
THEIR SPIRITS SEEMED TO RISE WITH THE THOUGHT OF DANGER ESPECIALLY AS MR CARTER HINTED AT A POSSIBLE REWARD FOR EACH OF THEM IF THEY SHOULD ASSIST IN THE CAPTURE OF THE RUNAWAY
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS ME BUT I AM DETERMINED THIS BUSINESS SHALL BE CLEARED UP BEFORE I LEAVE WINCHESTER
BUT FOR THE THIRD TIME SHE WAS BAFFLED
OF COURSE THERE WILL ANSWERED THE LANDLORD
MAJOR VERNON HAD A VERY BIG CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH AND A VERY BIG CANE IN HIS HAND AND THE QUIET CITY MEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM AS HE STOOD UPON THE PAVEMENT TALKING TO HENRY DUNBAR
WILMOT KNOWS THAT I DINE AT EIGHT AND THAT I EXPECT HIM TO DINE WITH ME
CLEMENT SHE CRIED YOU SURELY WON'T GO OUT WITHOUT YOUR GREATCOAT--UPON SUCH A BITTER NIGHT AS THIS TOO BUT MR AUSTIN DID NOT STOP TO LISTEN TO HIS MOTHER'S REMONSTRANCE
IT WAS A LONELY PLACE THIS GROVE
THEY KNEW NOTHING OF HIM OF COURSE EXCEPT THAT HE WAS HENRY DUNBAR CHIEF OF THE RICH BANKING-HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY AND THAT HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE
NO I SENT MY SERVANT ON TO INQUIRE IF THE OLD LADY IS AT HOME
BUT THEY HAVE NOT GONE DOWN TO POSTERITY AS EXAMPLES OF WISDOM
AS HE SAT NOW WATCHING HIS DAUGHTER AT HER WORK THE SHADOWS OF BLACK THOUGHTS DARKENED HIS BROW AND SPREAD A SOMBRE GLOOM OVER HIS FACE
ARTHUR LOVELL WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH LAURA DUNBAR'S NURSE
POOR PAPA SHE MURMURED SOFTLY
I KNOW MY FATHER'S FACE SO WELL AS IT IS THAT I MUST CERTAINLY HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF IT AS IT WAS FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO HOWEVER MUCH HE MAY HAVE ALTERED IN THE INTERVAL
WHY DO YOU FOLLOW ME ABOUT TO PLAY THE SPY UPON ME AND STOP ME IN THE PUBLIC STREET
SOME BOYS LOITERING ABOUT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE MEADOWS ANSWERED ALL HER QUESTIONS AND TOOK HER TO THE SPOT UPON WHICH THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
MY DUTY IS VERY SIMPLE AND LIES STRAIGHT BEFORE ME
I HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YET AND I UNDERSTOOD THIS AS A HINT TO BEGIN
WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY STORY HE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES
AND THEY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE WHICH THEY SHALL REPENT HAVING MADE SOONER OR LATER
HE FOUND THAT HE HAD A VERY INTELLIGENT PUPIL IN THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER
HE TORE A SIMILAR LABEL OFF THE CARPET-BAG TAKING CARE THAT NO VESTIGE OF THE CLERK'S NAME WAS LEFT BEHIND
AND NOW COME ALONG MISS LAURA AND HAVE YOUR HAIR DONE IF YOU MEAN TO HAVE ANY BACK-HAIR AT ALL TO-DAY
WHEN YOUR END AND AIM LIES IN DRIVING A MAN MAD THE QUICKER YOU DRIVE THE BETTER I SHOULD THINK ALL THIS WAS MUTTERED IN AN UNDERTONE NOT INTENDED FOR THE EAR OF THE RAILWAY OFFICIAL
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT----EH HE WAS QUITE EXCITED AT THE BARE IDEA THAT THIS PRETTY GIRL HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE MURDER AND THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF INTRODUCING HER TO HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS
HAVE YOU GROWN TO BE SUCH A MERE MACHINE SUCH A SPEAKING AUTOMATON SUCH A LIVING TOOL OF THE MEN YOU SERVE THAT ALL HUMAN FEELING HAS PERISHED IN YOUR BREAST
HE WAS A VERY GOOD WALKER AND INDEED HAD BECOME PRETTY WELL USED TO PEDESTRIAN EXERCISE IN THE COURSE OF LONG WEARY TRAMPINGS FROM ONE RACECOURSE TO ANOTHER WHEN HE WAS SO FAR DOWN ON HIS LUCK AS TO BE UNABLE TO PAY HIS RAILWAY FARE
LA YES MISS
CLEMENT AUSTIN THREW THE PRETTY LITTLE GENEVESE TOY UPON THE FLOOR AND GROUND IT TO ATOMS UNDER THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT
BUT AS ON THE DAY IN PORTLAND PLACE A CHILL CREPT THROUGH HER VEINS AS SHE FELT THE DEADLY COLDNESS OF HER FATHER'S HANDS LIFTED TO PUSH HER GENTLY FROM HIM
AND AMIDST ALL BRAVE MEN WITH WHITE FACES HURRYING HERE AND THERE WITH LAMPS IN THEIR HANDS HALF-MAIMED AND WOUNDED SOME OF THEM BUT FORGETFUL OF THEMSELVES IN THEIR CARE FOR THE HELPLESS WRETCHES ROUND THEM
THE NAPLESS DIRTY WHITE HAT HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A MAGNIFICENT BEAVER WITH A BROAD TRIM CURLED AT THE SIDES
BUT THEY FREELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME-LOOKING FELLOW AND THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS AN ANGEL RENDERED STILL MORE ANGELIC BY THE EARTHLY ADVANTAGE OF HALF A MILLION OR SO FOR HER MARRIAGE-PORTION
MARGARET DARLING YOU ARE CRYING
THE VERY SOUND OF MY NAME MUST IN FUTURE BE HATEFUL TO HER
AND HE NEVER DID UNTIL HE SAW IT IN HER COFFIN
I'LL COME BACK BY-AND-BY AND WRITE YOU A CHEQUE YOU'LL MAKE IT A THUMPING ONE I'LL MAKE IT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT THAT'S THE SORT OF THING
HE ASKED HER ONCE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN WHICH HIS SERVICES OR HIS MOTHER'S COULD BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE TO HER
JAMES WENTWORTH WENT UP CLOSE TO HIM AND TOUCHED HIM LIGHTLY ON THE SHOULDER
I WAS STILL GLADDER FOR THE SAKE OF THAT DEAR HOPE WHICH WAS MORE TO ME THAN ANY HOPE ON EARTH--THE HOPE OF MAKING MARGARET MY WIFE
I WANT TO GET HOME QUICKLY
BUT AT ANY RATE IT WAS A SMILE
BUT HE HAD BEGUN LIFE AS A GENTLEMAN
THE FIXED DILATED EYES
AND HAD SO TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE SO CHANGED THE VERY CURRENT OF HIS BEING THAT HE WENT AWAY OUT OF THAT WOOD NOT ALONE BUT DOGGED STEP BY STEP BY A GAUNT STALKING CREATURE A HIDEOUS MONSTER THAT ECHOED HIS EVERY BREATH AND FOLLOWED AT HIS SHOULDER AND CLUNG ABOUT HIM AND GRAPPLED HIS THROAT AND WEIGHED HIM DOWN
SHE WENT THROUGH THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE WHERE THE DIAMOND CASEMENTS WERE ALL DARKENED FOR THE NIGHT AND UNDER THE GLOOMY ARCHWAY PAST THE DARK SHADOWS WHICH THE PONDEROUS CASTLE-TOWERS FLUNG ACROSS THE RIPPLING WATER
I AM CERTAIN THAT SHE IS INCAPABLE OF ANY SUCH BASENESS
HE WAS A VERY PLEASANT-SPOKEN GENTLEMAN THE FLYMAN ADDED AND PAID UNCOMMON LIBERAL
THE GOTHIC PORCH WAS PONDEROUS AS THE PORCH OF A CHURCH
AND TO THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE FANCIED YOU COLD AND UNKIND TO ME AT THE VERY TIME WHEN YOUR SILENT EMOTION WAS AN EVIDENCE OF YOUR LOVE ARTHUR LOVELL HAD GONE THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW INTO THE CONSERVATORY
HENRY DUNBAR OPENED THIS LOCKET WHICH CONTAINED THE MINIATURE OF A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH FAIR RIPPLING HAIR AS BRIGHT AS BURNISHED GOLD AND LIMPID BLUE EYES
HE WOULD LOVE HER ALL THE MORE TENDERLY BECAUSE OF THOSE LONG YEARS DURING WHICH THEY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
WHAT WAS THE USE OF THROWING WET DAHLIAS AND FLABBY CHRYSANTHEMUMS INTO THE PUDDLES THROUGH WHICH THE BRIDE MUST TREAD HEIRESS THOUGH SHE WAS
OH NO MR DUNBAR
BUT SUCH VIOLENT EMOTION AS SHE HAS EVIDENTLY ENDURED MIGHT PRODUCE BRAIN-FEVER
IF HE HAD TO AFFECT FRIENDLY ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE MAN WHOM HE WAS HUNTING TO THE GALLOWS
I CAN SEE THE LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED PARLOUR NOW AS I SPEAK OF THAT TIME
ALL GLOOMY MEMORIES SEEMED TO HAVE MELTED AWAY FROM THIS MAN'S MIND
NO JOSEPH,--NO CRIED SAMPSON WILMOT
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY PALAVER ABOUT THAT
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIM
AND I RETURNED TO THE CATHEDRAL
LAURA HAD RECEIVED NO NOTICE OF HER FATHER'S COMING
SOMETHING IN HIS GRAVE FACE FRIGHTENED HER
I FOUND AT SOUTHAMPTON THAT I SHOULD HAVE A FEW HOURS ON MY HANDS BEFORE I COULD TRAVEL EXPRESS FOR LONDON AND I CAME TO THIS PLACE ON PURPOSE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND
MARGARET'S HAND WAS UPON THE MASSIVE KNOB OF THE DOOR UPON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HALL BEFORE THE FOOTMAN HAD PUT THIS LAST INDIGNANT QUESTION
IT WAS ONLY AFTER DINNER WHEN SOME PETRIFIED SPECIMENS OF DESSERT IN THE SHAPE OF ALMONDS AND RAISINS FIGS AND BISCUITS HAD BEEN ARRANGED ON THE TABLE THAT ANY SERIOUS BUSINESS BEGAN
THE ARTIST TOOK OUT ONE OF HIS OWN CARDS AND WROTE THE REQUIRED ADDRESS IN PENCIL
A BUNDLE OF RAGS A BOY TOLD ME--A BOY WHO HAD BEEN ABOUT WITH THE MEN ALL DAY--'A BUNDLE OF RAGS IT LOOKED LIKE HE SAID
HIS BONY HANDS WERE RED AND BARE AND ONLY ONE MISERABLE MOCKERY OF A GLOVE DANGLED BETWEEN HIS THUMB AND FINGER AS HE SWAGGERED ALONG THE VILLAGE STREET
BUT THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN WAS A PASSPORT AND SHE WAS USHERED AT ONCE INTO A LOW ROOM WHICH WAS LINED WITH BOOK-SHELVES AND OPENED INTO AN OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN
HE HAD NO TIME TO TURN AMATEUR DETECTIVE SO LONG AS HE REMAINED AT THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
TWO BEDROOMS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SITTING-ROOM WERE ASSIGNED TO US
OH WHAT SHALL I DO IF MY FATHER IS UNKIND TO ME SHE SAID PITEOUSLY
THE SIN HE HAD COMMITTED IN HIS YOUTH SAT VERY LIGHTLY UPON HIS CONSCIENCE
I CAN SCARCELY TELL YOU
I'VE NO DOUBT THE CONSTABLES ARE ON THE LOOK-OUT ALREADY
NOW WE HAVE DONE WITH ALL THESE HEROICS HE SAID PERHAPS YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ORDER LUNCHEON FOR ME CHAPTER VIII
THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM WAS LAID FOR DINNER AND MRS AUSTIN WAS NODDING IN A GREAT ARM-CHAIR NEAR THE FIRE WITH THE COUNTY NEWSPAPER IN HER LAP
GOT INTO ANOTHER--A HANSOM AND FASTER THAN YOURS--CAME BEHIND YOU TO THE CORNER OF THIS STREET YOU FOLLOWED ME SAID HENRY DUNBAR BITTERLY
BUT NEITHER OF THEM EXPRESSED EITHER REGRET OR SURPRISE
I KNOW THAT MY OLD SCHOOLFELLOW ARTHUR LOVELL WILL HELP ME WITH ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL
HE HAD DEFIED DISCOVERY
AND UNPRETENDING IN ITS EXTERIOR
THEY HAD BEEN SEPARATED FOR THE BEST PART OF HER BRIEF LIFETIME
SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER HALF-SISTER DORA MACMAHON WHO OF LATE YEARS HAD ALMOST LIVED AT THE ABBEY MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF LAURA
IT'S NO USE SIR HE SAID
SHE WAS VERY LOVELY WHEN SHE SMILED
SMOKING MY AFTER-DINNER CIGAR IN THE NARROW PATHWAYS AND MINIATURE SHRUBBERIES OF MY MOTHER'S GARDEN I COULD VENTURE TO THINK OF MY LOST MARGARET
YES THERE WAS SOMETHING OF CONSEQUENCE AMONGST THE PAPERS--SOMETHING AT LEAST WHICH I SHOULD HAVE HELD IT SACRILEGIOUS TO CONSIGN TO MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID--THE WRAPPER OF THE BOX CONTAINING THE DIAMONDS
SHE WAS TO STAY AT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE A FEW WEEKS AND WAS THEN TO GO BACK TO HER AUNT IN SCOTLAND
THE MAJOR COULD ONLY SEE FOUR FACES;--THE FACES OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM THE RECTOR AND HIS CURATE
DARK SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN WORKING IN HIS BREAST
HE COULD ONLY THINK
TO THE MEMORY OF J
THERE HAD BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE SICK CHAMBER
MR DUNBAR'S OWN MAN WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO BE QUESTIONED AND TO HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOURSING UPON THE EVENT WHICH HAD CAUSED SUCH EXCITEMENT AND CONSTERNATION
YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO SPEAK TO HIM THE TRAIN WAS MOVING
THE VERGER WAS STILL BETTER PLEASED WHEN MR DUNBAR GAVE HIM HALF A SOVEREIGN AS THE REWARD FOR HIS AFTERNOON'S TROUBLE
AND THAT HIS MANNER HAD BETRAYED SUCH AGITATION AS COULD OF COURSE ONLY SPRING FROM ONE CAUSE NAMELY HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS DAUGHTER
HE GAVE BACK LOOK FOR LOOK
SHE STOOD BEFORE HER FATHER NOW PALE AND BREATHLESS WITH HER LIPS PARTED AND HER BOSOM HEAVING
I KNOW NOTHING OF THE SCIENCE OF DETECTION MARGARET
I FOUND HIM AN AGREEABLE COMPANION
IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE WEATHER GREW TOO COLD FOR OUT-OF-DOOR DRAWING LESSONS THAT SIR PHILIP BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT WAS TIME TO CONTEMPLATE THE VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS OF A PROPOSAL
IN THE COURSE OF THAT INTERVIEW CLEMENT AUSTIN PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT ARTHUR LOVELL HAD COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AS HIMSELF THOUGH THE YOUNG LAWYER WAS SLOW TO EXPRESS HIS OPINION
THE INCESSANT RAIN-DROPS DRIPPED FROM THE LOW BRANCHES OF THE BLACK SPREADING CEDARS OF LEBANON
AND IN SPITE OF THEIR SPLENDOUR THE ROOMS HAD A GLOOMY LOOK
IT'S SO PLEASANT TO REMEMBER AULD LANG SYNE WELL ASKED MR DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY WHAT IS IT YOU WANT OF ME A BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY--THE BEST YOU HAVE IN YOUR CELLAR--SOMETHING TO EAT AND--THAT WHICH A POOR MAN GENERALLY ASKS OF HIS RICH FRIENDS--HIS FORTUNATE FRIENDS--MONEY YOU SHALL NOT FIND ME ILLIBERAL TOWARDS YOU
I SHALL BE BACK HERE IN HALF AN HOUR HE WALKED OUT OF THE SHOP LEAVING THE MAN STILL STARING WITH THE THREE NOTES IN HIS HAND
MARGARET GATHERED TOGETHER THESE LETTERS AND EXAMINED THEM
HE WAS AGITATED AND ANXIOUS
AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S TIME THE MILLIONAIRE WAS RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND OPENED HIS EYES UPON THE EAGER FACES OF TWO MEDICAL GENTLEMEN AND UPON A ROOM THAT WAS STRANGE TO HIM
ALEXANDER MIGHT CONQUER NATIONS IN VERY SPORT
A YOUNG LADY--WITH MR DUNBAR HO
OUR CALLS ARE SOMETIMES HEAVY
HE SEATED HIMSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW TOOK UP A COUNTRY NEWSPAPER AND TRIED TO READ
AND HER COURAGE FAILED HER ALL AT ONCE AND HER HEART SANK IN HER BREAST ON THE VERY THRESHOLD OF THE CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE WAS TO STAND FACE TO FACE WITH HENRY DUNBAR
AND THIS WAS A PRETTY HIGH STAKE MR CARTER TOLD ME AS THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS WENT
CARRY IT BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE YOU WENT TO INDIA WHAT THEN DO YOU REMEMBER LOSING A HEAP OF MONEY ON THE DERBY AND BEING IN SO DESPERATE A FRAME OF MIND THAT YOU TOOK THE HOLSTER-PISTOLS DOWN FROM THEIR PLACE ABOVE THE CHIMNEY-PIECE IN YOUR BARRACK SITTING-ROOM AND THREATENED TO BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT
AND SO I WAS BEING UNCOMMONLY INTERESTED IN THE CORN-FIELDS WE WERE PASSING JUST THEN SO FLAT AND STUMPY AND PICTURESQUE THEY LOOKED
THE WARWICKSHIRE BARONET KNEW A GOOD MANY PEOPLE IN PARIS AND HE AND HIS BRIDE RECEIVED A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME FROM THESE OLD FRIENDS WHO PRONOUNCED THAT MILADI JOCELYN WAS CHARMANTE AND LA BELLE DES BELLES
THE GROUND BENEATH THE FEET OF THESE TWO IDLE WANDERERS WAS A SOFT BED OF MOSS AND RARELY-TRODDEN GRASS
FOR THOUGH NO STEPS WERE TAKEN AGAINST HIM HE LOST HIS CHARACTER AND NEVER HELD HIS HEAD UP IN AN HONEST SITUATION AGAIN
CLEMENT AUSTIN WENT BACK TO THE WINDOW
IT WAS GETTING ON FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK BY THIS TIME AND JOSEPH WILMOT HAD HAD EIGHT-AND-FORTY HOURS START OF HIM
IF IT SHOULD BE A SELL AFTER ALL THOUGHT MR CARTER
AND MY ONLY HOPE OF PENETRATING THE HIDDEN CAUSE OF HER CONDUCT LAY IN MR CARTER'S POWER TO SOLVE THE DARK ENIGMA OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DEATH
AND MR CARTER INFORMED CLEMENT THAT THERE WERE MORE CATS IN SCOTLAND YARD THAN COULD FIND MICE TO KILL
HIS OWN LIPS HAD TOLD HER THE CRUEL TRUTH
THE WINTRY SKY WAS LOW AND DARK AS IF THE HEAVENS HAD BEEN COMING GRADUALLY DOWN TO CRUSH THIS WICKED EARTH
HE HAD NOT SEEMED TO LISTEN TO THE MAN'S ACCOUNT OF THE CRIME THAT HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND YET HE HAD EVIDENTLY HEARD EVERYTHING
HER MANNER WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ALTERATION IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE DISMAL CITY CHAMBER
BETTY COME HERE SHE WENT BACK TO HER MASTER AND MR CARTER HEARD A WHISPERED CONVERSATION VERY BRIEF OF WHICH THE LAST SENTENCE ONLY WAS AUDIBLE
I PUT THE FOLDED PAPER IN THE BREAST-POCKET OF MY COAT AND TOOK DOWN BRADSHAW
THERE HAD BEEN PLENTY OF TIME FOR HIM TO THINK AND PLOT IN THE LONG NIGHTS THAT HE HAD SPENT IN THOSE SPLENDID ROOMS--THOSE NOBLE CHAMBERS WHOSE GRANDEUR HAD BEEN MORE HIDEOUS TO HIM THAN THE BLANK WALLS OF A CONDEMNED CELL
I KNEW THIS AND I HAD NO HOPE THAT SHE WOULD EVER FORGIVE ME FOR MY PART IN THE WEAVING OF THAT STRANGE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE WHICH MADE THE CONDEMNATION OF JOSEPH WILMOT
PROVIDENCE HAS THROWN HIM INTO MY POWER MARGARET SAID WHEN CLEMENT REPEATED TO HER THE INFORMATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM ARTHUR LOVELL,--"PROVIDENCE HAS THROWN THIS MAN INTO MY POWER
AS I TURNED AWAY FROM THE POST-OFFICE TO GO BACK TO THE HIGH STREET I WAS STARTLED BY THE APPARITION OF A GIRLISH FIGURE UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET--A FIGURE SO LIKE MARGARET'S THAT ITS PRESENCE IN THAT STREET FILLED ME WITH A VAGUE SENSE OF FEAR AS IF THE SLENDER FIGURE WITH GARMENTS FLUTTERING IN THE WIND HAD BEEN A PHANTOM
HER LIPS WERE CONVULSIVELY CONTRACTED BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF EMOTION IN HER FACE
AND HOW I HATED MR HENRY CARTER DETECTIVE OFFICER AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT
WE'VE FOUND THE MURDERED MAN'S CLOTHES
CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING TOLD HER OF THE BANKER'S INTENDED VISIT TO THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE AND THE YOUNG MUSIC-MISTRESS HAD MADE HASTY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE POSTPONEMENT OF HER USUAL DUTIES IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GO TO THE CITY TO SEE HENRY DUNBAR
THE DETECTIVE CALLED UPON HIM TWO DAYS AFTER THE INTERVIEW AT SCOTLAND YARD
AND I SHALL BE DETAINED TILL ALL THAT IS OVER
BUT DO TELL ME ALL ABOUT THIS BUSINESS THERE'S A DEAR GOOD BOY UNFORTUNATELY THE DEAR GOOD BOY WAS OBLIGED TO TELL HIS MOTHER THAT THE BUSINESS IN QUESTION WAS LIKE HIS MOTIVE FOR RESIGNING HIS SITUATION A PROFOUND SECRET AND THAT IT MUST REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
HE WAS HARDENED STEEPED IN GUILT AND CALLOUS AS TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
EVERY GOOD DEED THAT HE HAS DONE IS DENOUNCED AS THE ACT OF A HYPOCRITE
POOR CHILD
ON THE CONTRARY I WAS THINKING OF LOOKING IN UPON HIM AT THE ABBEY THIS EVENING HUMPH MURMURED THE DETECTIVE THEN IT'S NO USE MY ASKING YOU ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT NONE WHATEVER
YOU'VE ONLY JUST TO POP THAT ON AND THERE YOU ARE
YOU KNOW ALL AND YOU HAVE NO DOUBT FORGIVEN AND PERHAPS IN PART FORGOTTEN THE WRETCHED WOMAN TO WHOM YOUR LOVE WAS ONCE SO DEAR AND TO WHOM THE MEMORY OF YOUR LOVE WILL EVER BE A CONSOLATION AND A HAPPINESS
A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT IN INDIA HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF A NOBLEMAN A FRIEND OF HIS FATHER'S
I HEARD FROM CLEMENT'S MOTHER THAT HE HAD GONE THERE
MR DUNBAR HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH AS TO HIS APPETITE FOR HIS DINNER
I TOLD THE DETECTIVE THAT HE SEEMED BENT UPON MYSTIFYING ME AND THAT HE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT
WILL YOU DO THIS SHE SAID
SHE LEFT THE TOWN AND WENT OUT UPON THE LONELY COUNTRY ROAD THROUGH PATCHES OF MOONLIGHT AND SHADOW FEARLESS IN HER SELF-ABNEGATION WITH ONLY ONE THOUGHT IN HER MIND
UNLESS WHAT
THE DEAD MAN'S FACE WAS NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE
HIS CHEEKS WERE SUNKEN
AT LAST THE BREAKFAST WAS FINISHED
THEN HE HEARD THE GREAT DOOR OF THE HOUSE CLOSE UPON JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER
I FLATTER MYSELF I WAS JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME THE MAJOR THOUGHT AS HE WALKED BACK TO WOODBINE COTTAGE FOR AS SURE AS MY NAME'S WHAT IT IS MY FRIEND MEANS A BOLT
DIDN'T I SEE YOUR MOTHER ON THE DAY WHEN SHE FOUND OUT WHAT MY HISTORY WAS
AND IT WOULD BE A POOR RETURN FOR YOUR KINDNESS IF IF YOU WERE TO MAKE ME UNUTTERABLY HAPPY EH MARGARET
HERE MR CARTER STOPPED AND ENTERED BY THE LITTLE ALLEY WITHIN WHOSE SOMBRE SHADOWS THE CITIZENS OF HULL WERE WONT TO SKULK ASHAMED OF THE ERRAND THAT BETRAYED THEIR IMPECUNIOSITY
AND WITH A HASTY GOOD EVENING THE MEDICAL MAN QUITTED THE ROOM
AND WE COME TO NORMANTON AND THE FURRY GENT LIMPS ABOUT NORMANTON STATION AND I SEES HIM COMFORTABLE IN HIS CARRIAGE
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY EAGER GOSSIPS GREEDY TO HEAR ANYTHING HE MIGHT HAVE TO TELL UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE MURDER
I WOULD MOST EARNESTLY ADVISE YOU TO SEE HER PLEADED ARTHUR LOVELL
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR MURDERED YOUR UNHAPPY FATHER NO ANSWERED MARGARET RESOLUTELY
I KNOW THAT THE MEAL SEEMED TO ENDURE FOR THE ABNORMAL PERIOD OF HALF-A-DOZEN HOURS OR SO
EVERYBODY IN WINCHESTER IS TALKING ABOUT IT
IF YOU EXPECT ANY ADVANTAGE FROM ME YOU MUST MAKE YOURSELF AGREEABLE TO ME
BUT PEOPLE RESPECTED AND ADMIRED HER NOTWITHSTANDING
IF SHE CONDUCTS HERSELF WITH PROPRIETY AND REFRAINS FROM ATTEMPTING ANY ANNOYANCE AGAINST MR DUNBAR
I HAVE NOT BEEN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD SINCE I WAS A BOY
HE ATE HIS SUPPER IN HIS OWN ROOM THOUGH HE WAS REQUESTED TO TAKE IT IN THE PUBLIC APARTMENT
YES THAT WILL BE MUCH BETTER HE SAID
NOTHING THAT SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE HAD SAID HAD IN ANY WAY WEAKENED HER ROOTED CONVICTION OF HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT
HE WAS TRANSPORTED THIRTY YEARS AGO FOR FORGERY
LOVELL HE SAID AT LAST PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GO AND SEE THIS PERSON
VERY LITTLE CHANGED
AND IN FIVE MINUTES MR DUNBAR OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH A WILD HALF-TERRIFIED EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE GOT IT AT THE WARREN-COURT SALE THE OTHER DAY AT THE OTHER END OF THE COUNTY
LAURA FOR YOUR LOVE I SHOULD OVERCOME OBSTACLES THAT TO ANOTHER MAN MIGHT BE INVINCIBLE
I WAS AWAY IN GLASGOW HUNTING UP THE PARTICULARS OF THE GREAT SCOTCH-PLAID ROBBERIES ALL LAST SUMMER AND I CAN'T SAY I REMEMBER MUCH OF WHAT WAS DONE IN THE WILMOT BUSINESS
ARTHUR LOVELL WAS SILENT
WHEN YOU SMILED AT ME YOUR SMILE WAS A MOCKERY
SO OF COURSE I SHALL NOT PROSECUTE YOU
THERE'S A COUPLE OF SHELVES STILL TO EXAMINE
SHE HAS LOCKED HERSELF IN HER OWN ROOM
WE'LL DINE AT THE GEORGE AND GO UP TO LONDON BY THE EXPRESS WHICH LEAVES WINCHESTER AT A QUARTER PAST TEN
GOD BLESS YOU
THE REINDEER WAS A WELL-BUILT HOUSE SOLID AND OLD-FASHIONED AND LISTENERS LURKING IN THE LONG PASSAGES HAD SMALL CHANCE OF REAPING MUCH REWARD FOR THEIR PAINS UNLESS THEY FOUND A FRIENDLY KEYHOLE
THEY WERE THERE UNDER THE TREES AND THEY WERE DRAGGING THE WATER DRAGGING THE WATER
I ORDERED DINNER FOR SIX O'CLOCK HAVING ASCERTAINED THAT HOUR TO BE AGREEABLE TO MR CARTER WHO WAS SLOWLY REMOVING HIS WRAPPINGS AND LOOKING DELIBERATELY AT EVERY SEPARATE ARTICLE IN THE ROOM
THE REINDEER WAS A COMFORTABLE OLD-FASHIONED HOTEL
THOUGH TIME AND DEATH HAD DONE THEIR WORK OF CHANGE AMONGST THE OWNERS OF THAT NAME
I WANT TO GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HENRY DUNBAR THE RAILWAY OFFICIAL STARTED AND STARED AGHAST
IT WAS NEW TO HER TO BREATHE THE BRIGHT ATMOSPHERE THAT SURROUNDS THOSE WHO LEAD A VIRTUOUS GOD-FEARING LIFE
I DARE SAY I AM A FOOLISH OLD WOMAN BUT I ALWAYS BEGIN TO THINK OF RAILWAY COLLISIONS AND ALL MANNER OF POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE CALAMITIES DIRECTLY YOU LEAVE ME ON EVER SO SHORT A JOURNEY
THE RIGID OUTLINE OF THE CORPSE WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE UNDER THE LINEN SHEET THAT SHROUDED IT
HIS WHITE FIXED FACE REPELLED ME
NEVER YOU MIND SIR HE SAID
HENRY DUNBAR WALKED AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HOLBORN WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED TIGHTLY ACROSS HIS BROAD CHEST AND NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF PROPERTY HIDDEN AWAY IN HIS BREAST-POCKETS
THEY DRAGGED THE WATER MARGARET SAID
THE VERGER WAS THE NEXT PERSON EXAMINED
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THE WIND MAY CHANGE AFTER DARK RETURNED THE DETECTIVE
MR DUNBAR THE CONSTABLE AND MR BALDERBY DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE MAGISTRATE'S HOUSE
AND A LITTLE SHOWER OF WITHERED ROSE-LEAVES DROPPED FROM THE PAGES OF WILHELM MEISTER AFTER SHE HAD RETURNED ME THE VOLUME
LAURA DID NOT APPEAR TO TAKE MUCH INTEREST IN THE MISS MELVILLES HAIR
THE LARGE HAZEL EYES WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL--ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS BECAUSE OF A SOFT MELANCHOLY THAT SUBDUED THEIR NATURAL BRIGHTNESS
BUT HE WOULD TELL NO MORE
WHY SHOULD ANY ONE COME TO HIM AT SUCH AN HOUR UNLESS--UNLESS IT WAS DISCOVERED
THE MILLIONAIRE WAS VERY COURTEOUS VERY CONCILIATING
THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF BRANDY AND A GLASS ON THE TABLE NEAR THE COUCH
DO NOT DESPAIR MR LOVELL
THIS WAS HIS LAST RACE AND HE HAD SET HIS HEART UPON WINNING
MR HENRY TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF NOTICE OF JOSEPH AND USED TO TALK TO HIM WHILE HE WAS WAITING ABOUT TO SEE HIS FATHER OR HIS UNCLE
I CAME TO BE OF USE TO YOU
THERE'S A LIKENESS--THERE'S CERTAINLY A LIKENESS
TRY AS I MIGHT TO CARRY MY BURDEN QUIETLY AND PUT A BRAVE FACE UPON MY SORROW
SO I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME TO LOSE HE TOOK THE BUNDLE FROM THE PORTMANTEAU WRAPPED IT IN A SHEET OF BROWN PAPER WHICH THE WAITER HAD BROUGHT HIM A FEW MINUTES BEFORE AND HURRIED AWAY
I DON'T KNOW THAT
YES SURELY HE MUST HAVE STARTED UPON IT
THAT POINT ADMITS OF NO DISCUSSION I TOOK OUT MY POCKET-BOOK GAVE THE DETECTIVE MONEY FOR HIS EXPENSES AND WISHED HIM GOOD NIGHT
FOR MARGARET THIS PENNILESS FRIENDLESS GIRL HAD BECOME VERY DEAR TO HER--A REAL DAUGHTER NOT IN LAW BUT BOUND BY THE SWEET TIES OF GRATITUDE AND AFFECTION
AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS MR DUNBAR CAME OUT INTO THE HALL WITH HIS GREATCOAT CLOSELY BUTTONED OVER HIS BROAD CHEST AND A LEOPARD-SKIN TRAVELLING-RUG FLUNG ACROSS HIS SHOULDER
IT WAS HOPELESS IN THE PRESENT AT ANY RATE
SO LONG AS I LIVE HE SHALL BE MADE TO REMEMBER
THE PUPIL WAS A VERY VIVACIOUS YOUNG LADY WHO CALLED HER MUSIC-MISTRESS DEAR AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO WASTE HALF AN HOUR OR SO IN AN ANIMATED CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LAST NEW STYLE IN BONNETS OR THE SHAPE OF THE FASHIONABLE WINTER MANTLE OR THE POPULAR NOVEL OF THE MONTH
HE WENT AT ONCE TO LAURA AND TOLD HER WHAT MR DUNBAR HAD SAID
IF YOU CAN HONESTLY RECOMMEND THE PLACE AS WORTH SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS I'M WILLING TO PAY THAT MONEY FOR IT DOWN ON THE NAIL
YES IT WAS DEVILISH PROVOKING
BUT I HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MARGARET WILMOT WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SOME GREAT TERROR WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY WHAT REASON ASKED MR CARTER
BUT HE SHALL SEE ME SOONER OR LATER
WHEN THE MAN WHO COMMITTED THE SIN HAD WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN IT
BY THAT TIME HE HAD ARRANGED ALL THE PAPERS WITH UNUSUAL PRECISION AND REPLACED THEM IN ONE OF THE PORTMANTEAUS
THIS IS WHAT'S THE MATTER HE SAID
THE CORONER QUESTIONED THE SURGEON VERY CLOSELY AS TO HOW LONG HE THOUGHT THE MURDERED MAN HAD BEEN DEAD
BUT LOOK HERE SINCE YOU'RE SO AFRAID OF MY PUTTING MY FOOT IN IT SUPPOSE I GO BACK TO LISFORD NOW AND I CAN RETURN TO YOU TO-NIGHT AFTER DARK
BUT MY HABITS OF LATE YEARS HAVE BEEN SEDENTARY
MISS WILSON HAD LIVED WITH HER PAPA TILL THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN'S DEATH OH HE WAS DEAD THEN YES MR WILSON HAD DIED IN THE PREVIOUS DECEMBER OF A KIND OF DECLINE FADING AWAY LIKE ALMOST UNBEKNOWN
HE HAD WANTED TO LEAVE MAUDESLEY
BUT I'D BETTER CONFESS IT FREELY
I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD TAKE THE MONEY AND BE CONTENT TO LEAVE THE MYSTERY UNRAVELLED
FROM HER HE HEARD THAT A JEWELLER'S ASSISTANT HAD BEEN TO MAUDESLEY AND HAD SUBMITTED A PORTFOLIO OF DESIGNS TO THE MILLIONAIRE
AND LAURA WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE YOUNG LAWYER
AND OF COURSE HE WEREN'T WATCHED--OH NO
OH PLEASE DON'T SIR THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST AND YET THE DETECTIVE PAUSED FOR A MINUTE THINKING OF WHAT HE HAD JUST HEARD
SHALL YOU PRESENT THOSE CHEQUES YOURSELF HENRY DUNBAR ASKED AS THE TWO MEN WERE ABOUT TO PART
SPEAK OUT THEN I AM AFRAID THE REASON YOU HAVE NEVER PROSPERED--THE REASON THAT SO MANY ARE AGAINST YOU--IS THAT YOU ONCE DID SOMETHING WRONG VERY LONG AGO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG AND RECKLESS AND SCARCELY KNEW THE NATURE OF YOUR OWN ACT
OF COURSE HE DID AND HE ADORED DANCING
THE BUSINESS OF TO-DAY HAS BROUGHT US TO THE VERY END WE WANT TO REACH
DON'T TELL HIM ONE PART OF YOUR STORY AND KEEP THE OTHER HALF HIDDEN FROM HIM
MARGARET TOOK THE NEW APARTMENTS IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO COME UP-STAIRS AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT MY NEW BONNET MURMURED DORA VAGUELY
SO THE MARRIAGE WAS APPOINTED TO TAKE PLACE ON THE 7TH AND THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE TO BE AS SIMPLE AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BRIDE WOULD ADMIT
WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVE FOR BEING SO EAGER TO SEE HIM I WILL TELL THAT TO MR DUNBAR HIMSELF YOU ARE REALLY THE DAUGHTER OF JOSEPH WILMOT
HE LAY THERE LISTENING TO THE MARCH WIND ROARING IN THE BROAD CHIMNEY AND WATCHING THE BLAZING COALS AND THE CRACKLING LOGS OF WOOD
SIR PHILIP HAD HALF-A-DOZEN SCHEMES FOR FREE SCHOOLS AND MODEL COTTAGES WITH OVENS THAT WOULD BAKE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND CHIMNEYS THAT WOULD NEVER SMOKE
PETER GROGSON AND VERY MUCH LOOKED UP TO BE IS AND A WARM MAN FOLKS DO SAY
BUT THERE WAS NO MORE VESTIGE OF HISSELF THAN THERE WAS IN THE STREETS WHERE I'D BEEN LOOKIN FOR HIM
OH YES
OH YES
AND IN THE SECOND JOSEPH WILMOT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CHAIN HIS ATTENTION TO THE PAGE UPON WHICH HIS EYES WERE FIXED THOUGH ALL THE WISDOM OF THE WORLD HAD BEEN CONCENTRATED UPON THAT ONE SHEET OF PRINTED PAPER
HENRY DUNBAR LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND SEEMED TO REFLECT UPON THIS QUESTION SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE ANSWERED
BUT PRAY REMEMBER THAT I DO NOT COMPLAIN
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MONEY HE MAY HAVE HAD ABOUT HIM WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE DOCTOR SIR--MR CRICKLEWOOD YES--NO--YOU HAVE TOLD ME ALL THAT THERE IS TO TELL I SUPPOSE YES SIR I SHALL GO TO BED
MR DUNBAR STILL PROTESTED AGAINST ANY OFFER OF BAIL
SHE TOLD HIM A GREAT DEAL
THE DOOR OF MISS DUNBAR'S MORNING-ROOM WAS OPEN
MR CARTER NEVER TRAVELLED WITHOUT A RAILWAY RUG AND A POCKET BRANDY-FLASK
OUR PRINCIPAL NEVER GIVES ANYTHING TO TRAMPS YOUR PRINCIPAL MAY GIVE OR KEEP WHAT HE LIKES JOSEPH ANSWERED CARELESSLY
MR DUNBAR WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH HIS HEAD BENT MOODILY UPON HIS BREAST
AND WHEREVER SHE WAS THERE WAS PARADISE IN THE OPINION OF THIS FOOLISH YOUNG MAN
THE CHANGE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HIS MANNER AFTER HE HAD READ MARGARET'S LETTER HAD INSPIRED ME WITH NEW CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND I WAS BETTER ABLE TO AWAIT THE WORKING OUT OF EVENTS
AND PARIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE WONDERFUL CITY OF ENDLESS BOULEVARDS AND PALATIAL EDIFICES THAT IT HAS SINCE GROWN TO BE UNDER THE MASTER HAND WHICH RULES AND BEAUTIFIES IT AS A LOVER ADORNS HIS MISTRESS
BUT HE QUICKLY RELAPSED INTO A GRIM SMILE
I SHALL HAVE--THANKS TO YOUR GENEROSITY AND AS AN ATONEMENT FOR ALL THE SHAME AND MISERY THE WANT AND PERIL AND DISGRACE WHICH I HAVE SUFFERED FOR FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS--A POUND A WEEK SECURED TO ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
STRANGE ISN'T IT THE EFFECT OF THESE LONG SEPARATIONS
HER EYES WERE TEARLESS AND THERE WAS A DESPERATE COURAGE AT HER HEART
WHILE A GENTLEMANLY PORTRAIT OF A COUNTY MEMBER WITH A CORINTHIAN PILLAR AND A CRIMSON CURTAIN GETS NO MORE ATTENTION THAN IF IT WAS A BISHOP'S HALF-LENGTH OF BLACK CANVAS
FOR HE SAID PRESENTLY IN SLOW THICK ACCENTS STRANGLED--AND THE BODY DRAGGED DOWN--TO THE WATER WHO--WHO COULD--HAVE DONE IT AH
IT IS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD GIVE HER A PRESENT PRECISELY AND YOU WON'T EVEN TRUST THE BUSINESS TO A JEWELLER
WELL I GOT UP BEHIND THE FLY AND RIDES A BIT AND WALKS A BIT KEEPIN THE FLY IN SIGHT UNTIL WE COMES TO THE VICTORIER
THERE ARE LANES AND BYWAYS LEADING OUT OF THAT HUMBLE HIGH STREET DOWN TO THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER
YES I AM HIS BROTHER I SHOULD RECOMMEND HIS BEING REMOVED TO THE NEAREST HOTEL
BUT AT THE THIRD PAWNBROKER'S HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE RIGHT TRACK
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH
HE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT HE AND HIS BETROTHED HAD PARTED
I MUST GO SAMPSON CRIED
WHAT WAS THERE IN MY BLOOD THAT SHOULD MAKE ME NOBLE OR GOOD OR STRONG TO STAND AGAINST TEMPTATION
NOTHING BUT HIS CONVICTION OF HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT COULD JUSTIFY HIM IN DESERTING HIS CLIENT
THE CENTRE OF THIS QUADRANGULAR COURT HAD BEEN MADE INTO A GARDEN WHERE TALL HOLLYHOCKS AND PRIM DAHLIAS FLAUNTED IN THE AUTUMN SUNSHINE
I WAS IN LOVE MYSELF ONCE THOUGH I DO SEEM SUCH A DRY OLD CHIP
I REMEMBER THAT
SHE HAD TRIED TO SEE IT
AND IF ONE SPECIES OF DECORATION IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO SHIVERING THAN ANOTHER IT CERTAINLY IS BRASS-WORK IN A STATE OF HIGH POLISH
HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS THAT FASTENED THE LONG FRENCH WINDOW OPENED IT AND ADMITTED MARGARET WILMOT
LOYAL JOCELYNS FIGHTING FOR THEIR KING AGAINST LOW-BORN ROUNDHEAD SOLDIERS HAD HIDDEN THEMSELVES IN THE SPACIOUS CHIMNEYS OR HAD FLED FOR THEIR LIVES ALONG THE SECRET PASSAGES BEHIND THE TAPESTRY
YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES WHEN DID I EVER SAY NO TO ANYTHING YOU ASKED ME LAURA
I DARE SAY YOU FANCY I ACTED CRUELLY TOWARDS YOU ON THAT WRETCHED DAY IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
YOU HAVE ESTATES IN WARWICKSHIRE AND YORKSHIRE A HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE AND HALF A MILLION OF MONEY
AND FORGET THAT YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN ME OR MY MISERABLE STORY MARGARET WILMOT EVEN THIS LETTER DID NOT SHAKE CLEMENT AUSTIN'S RESOLUTION
AND SHE EXPECTED HIS RETURN EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR
AND YET MR CARTER WITH ALL THE AID OF HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE DETECTIVE LINE COULD FIND NO CLUE TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE MAN HE WANTED
MR DUNBAR SAT IN AN EASY-CHAIR BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS STARING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE REFLECTION OF HIS OWN FACE PALE IN THE LIGHT OF THE TALL WAX-CANDLES
HE DID NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE THE MAN THOUGH HE WISHED TO LIKE HIM
BUT HE BELIEVED HIM TO BE INNOCENT OF THE DREADFUL CRIME IMPUTED TO HIM AND HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE THAT INNOCENCE CLEAR TO THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE
I HAD SEEN THE FORCE OF THAT AFFECTION TESTED BY SO MANY CRUEL TRIALS
ALL WERE NEW AND DELIGHTFUL TO MARGARET
THE OLD MAN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HIS HAVING SHOWN MR DUNBAR ALL OVER THE CATHEDRAL
I SHALL NOT LEAVE WINCHESTER WITHOUT THIS FELLOW WILMOT
HE COMMITTED FORGERY I BELIEVE
LADY JOCELYN IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FRANK GENEROUS NOBLE-HEARTED BELOVED BY EVERY CREATURE WITHIN TWENTY MILES RADIUS OF HER HOME AND IDOLIZED BY HER HUSBAND
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SOLEMN NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED GREW AND GATHERED FORCE IN MY MIND AND I FELT THAT I HAD SOMETHING MORE TO DO THAN TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF MARGARET'S CONDUCT TO MYSELF
HOLD YOUR HEAD STILL THAT'S A PRECIOUS DARLING AND DON'T YOU TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT LOOKING YOUR VERY BEST THIS DAY CHAPTER XXIV
A DISCOVERY AT THE LUXEMBOURG XXXVI
FOR IT SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT US NO STEP NEARER TO THE POINT WE WANTED TO REACH HASN'T IT MR AUSTIN CRIED THE DETECTIVE EAGERLY
AND HE HAS TELEGRAPHED TO ME TO GO TO HIM THERE IMMEDIATELY SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THEN YES BUT NOT TO MR DUNBAR INDIVIDUALLY
FOR A WEEK AFTER MY RETURN MR BALDERBY MADE ME AN OFFER WHICH I CONSIDERED AS GENEROUS AS IT WAS FLATTERING AND WHICH I ULTIMATELY AND SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTED
THE PEOPLE RUN AWAY TO SEE THEM TAKE THE DOUBLE LEAP IN THE LANE AND THEN COME TROOPING BACK AGAIN PANTING AND EAGER AS THREE OF THE RIDERS APPEAR AGAIN ROUND ANOTHER BEND OF THE COURSE
I'LL STROLL OVER TO SHORNCLIFFE THIS MORNING AND LOOK IN UPON MR GROGSON--GROGSON I THINK YOU SAID WAS THE AUCTIONEER'S NAME YES SIR
I MENTIONED THE NAME OF DUNBAR TO HIM THE PAINTER SAID
I WAS STILL AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON OF HIS HIGH SPIRITS
FOR I MUST LOOK OVER SOME PAPERS I HAVE AMONGST THE LUGGAGE THAT WAS SENT ON HERE FROM SOUTHAMPTON
THE BANKER'S FACE WAS PALE AND GRAVE AND STERN
TO-DAY TO-DAY OH
HE WOULD GO TO THE ABBEY AT ONCE AND ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF MARGARET'S DELAY
I'M SURE OF THAT FOR TIM BALING WAS DRIVIN IT AND WISHED ME GOOD-NIGHT MR CARTER LEFT THE LISFORD EMPORIUM AND RAN OVER TO THE ROSE AND CROWN WHERE HE SAW THE MAN WHO HAD DRIVEN HIM TO SHORNCLIFFE STATION
IT WAS NOT A COMMON MURDER
TO MARGARET THIS COMFORTABLE JOURNEY IN THE CUSHIONED CORNER OF A FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE RESPECTFULLY WAITED UPON BY THE MAN SHE LOVED POSSESSED AT LEAST THE CHARM OF NOVELTY
THEY HAVE SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO BE DISCOURAGED BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE CASE
BUT I COULDN'T FORGET IT
I DID NOT KNOW HIM AT FIRST--THAT IS TO SAY I DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM AS THE VALET WHO HAD BEEN IN MY SERVICE PRIOR TO MY LEAVING ENGLAND FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT NINE OUT OF TEN OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO PLACE THEMSELVES IN THIS PERILOUS POSITION FIND THE NARROW LINE VERY SLIPPERY AND BEFORE THEY HAVE GONE TWENTY PACES PLUNGE OVERBOARD PLUMP TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS AND ARE OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE BEFORE THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
AND THE WAITER WAS BEGINNING TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT THE FISH
THERE WAS NOTHING IN WHAT HE HAD TO TELL THEM THAT COULD IMPLICATE MR DUNBAR
IT IS RATHER INNOCENCE WHOSE EYELIDS DROP WHEN YOU PEER TOO CLOSELY INTO ITS EYES FOR INNOCENCE IS APPALLED BY THE STERN ACCUSING GLANCES WHICH IT IS UNPREPARED TO MEET
I NEVER SAW SUCH A CHANGE IN ANY ONE BEFORE
BUT SHE WILL ADMIT YOU NO DOUBT
BUT AFTER ALL THERE ARE FEW REAL THINGS THAT IT CAN PURCHASE
THIS WAS MR KERSTALL JUNIOR
A LITTLE GROUP OF GOSSIPS WERE GATHERED IN THE PRIMLY-FURNISHED PARLOUR AND THE TALK WAS LOUD AND ANIMATED
SAWNEY WAS RIGHT ENOUGH THERE HE WENT INTO THE TOWN AND WALKED ABOUT LOOKING AT THE JEWELLERS SHOPS WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED RAPID GLANCE--A GLANCE SO FURTIVE THAT IT ESCAPED OBSERVATION--SO FULL OF SHARP SCRUTINY THAT IT TOOK IN EVERY DETAIL OF THE OBJECT LOOKED AT
IT MAY BE THAT MR CARTER'S KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN USEFULNESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO PRESERVE HIS SELF-RESPECT
QUITE RIGHT
THE MOON GREW BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER IN A CLOUDLESS SKY AS THE FISHING-SMACK SHOT THROUGH THE WATER WHILE THE STEADY DIP OF THE OARS SEEMED TO KEEP TIME TO A WORDLESS TUNE
AND ONE CHILLY SEPTEMBER EVENING WHEN MISS WENTWORTH WAS NOT EXPECTED AT CLAPHAM HE WALKED ACROSS WANDSWORTH COMMON AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LANE IN WHICH GODOLPHIN COTTAGES SHELTERED THEMSELVES UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE SYCAMORES
OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TO ASSIST AT SIR PHILIP JOCELYN'S WEDDING PERHAPS THE FATHER OF THE BRIDE WAS THE PERSON WHO SEEMED LEAST AFFECTED BY THAT DRIZZLING RAIN THAT HOPELESSLY-BLACK SKY
BUT I WILL NOT ACCEPT MY LIBERTY ON SUFFERANCE
AND IF MALICIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD POINT TO YOU AND SAY CLEMENT AUSTIN'S WIFE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A THIEF AND A FORGER I WOULD GIVE THEM BACK SCORN FOR SCORN AND TELL THEM THAT I HONOUR MY WIFE FOR VIRTUES THAT HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES MISSING IN THE CONSORT OF AN EMPEROR FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT MORNING MARGARET'S EYES GREW DIM BUT SHE BRUSHED AWAY THE GATHERING TEARS WITH A RAPID MOVEMENT OF HER TREMBLING HAND
MR DUNBAR FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A LOW EASY-CHAIR AND TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER
FINISHED PICTURES THAT HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SELL
I'M TIRED OF THE LIFE OF A VAGABOND AND I WANT TO LIVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN;--NOT AS YOU DO OF COURSE
MR DUNBAR NEVER TOOK HIS EYES FROM THE DIAL OF HIS WATCH
FOR I KNOW HOW GOOD YOU ARE
THE VEHICLE TRAVELLED VERY SLOWLY FOR THE TRAFFIC WAS CONCENTRATED IN THIS QUARTER BY REASON OF THE STOPPAGE ON LUDGATE HILL AND MR DUNBAR WAS ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE AT HIS LEISURE THE BLACK PRISON-WALLS AND THE MEN AND WOMEN SELLING DOGS'-COLLARS UNDER THEIR DISMAL SHADOWS
THE HOUSE IN WHICH MR KERSTALL THE ENGLISH ARTIST LIVED WAS A GLOOMY-LOOKING BUILDING WITH A DINGY ARCHWAY BENEATH WHICH SIR PHILIP JOCELYN AND HIS WIFE ALIGHTED
YOU'LL BE WANTING YOUR TEA I DARE SAY I DID'NT THINK THERE WOULD BE MUCH IN THEM THE CONSTABLE SAID POINTING CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO THE WET RAGS
NO NO
NO NO
THIS PASSAGE WAS VERY DARK
SHE WAS LAURA JOCELYN NOW
MR DUNBAR WAS USHERED INTO A GREAT SUNNY SITTING-ROOM AT THE DOLPHIN
AND I ACCEPT YOUR GENEROUS OFFER HE LAUGHED AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING LOUDLY BUT NOT HEARTILY--RATHER STRANGELY PERHAPS
WERE THERE TWO HENRY CARTERS IN THE SMALL BAND OF LONDON DETECTIVE POLICE
WHATEVER HIS THOUGHTS WERE THEY ABSORBED HIM SO ENTIRELY THAT HE SEEMED LIKE A MAN WHO WALKS IN HIS SLEEP DOING EVERYTHING MECHANICALLY AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE DOES
AND THEY'D ALL LOSE POOR FELLOWS IF I HUNG BACK AT THE LAST
UNTIL LONG AFTER DARK THAT EVENING HENRY DUNBAR SAT BY THE FIRE SMOKING AND DRINKING AND READING THE MANUSCRIPT VOLUME
SHE GAVE A LITTLE SIGH AFTER SAYING THAT
HENCEFORTH SHE MUST ONLY PLEAD FOR HIM
I NEVER FULLY REALIZED THE NUMBER AND EXTENT OF FEMININE REQUIREMENTS UNTIL A HACK CAB DEPOSITED MY NIECE AND HER DEAL TRAVELLING-CASES AT OUR HALL-DOOR
I THOUGHT I COULDN'T BE MISTAKEN HE WENT INTO THE TICKET-OFFICE WHERE THE CLERK WAS STANDING AMONGST THE CROWD WAITING TO TAKE HIS TICKET
WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK THE CORONER SAID
HE CALLED UPON MISS DUNBAR ON THE 18TH
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THIS PURPOSE HAS BEEN UPPERMOST IN MY MIND EVER SINCE I HEARD OF THAT DREADFUL JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER
THERE WAS NO NEED TO BOLT DOORS AGAINST THIEVES AND VAGABONDS IN SUCH A QUIET TOWN AS SHORNCLIFFE
BUT MR CARTER SENT THE WAITER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY REAL CAUSE FOR ANXIETY THE BANKER SAID IN CONCLUSION
I'M OFF HE SAID BRISKLY
THE MAN WHO LOVES THE WOMAN HE HAS KNOWN AND WATCHED LOVES HER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES HER TO BE THE PUREST AND TRUEST OF HER SEX
YES SHE LOVED HIM
OR PERHAPS IT WOULD BE THOUGHT SCARCELY UNNATURAL IN A LONELY MAN WHOSE ONLY CHILD HAD MARRIED INTO A HIGHER SPHERE THAN HIS OWN
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT OVER THE SAME GROUND TRYING TO FIND SOME LURKING CIRCUMSTANCE NO MATTER HOW UNLIKELY IN ITS NATURE WHICH SHOULD EXPLAIN AND JUSTIFY MARGARET'S CONDUCT
AND LET ME KNOW THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT THE HEIRESS OF A MILLION OR THEREABOUTS IS QUITE SO READILY DISPOSED OF
BENEATH THE SHELTER OF THE OVERARCHING ELMS AMIDST THE RUSTLING OF THE TREMBLING FERNS LAURA DUNBAR AND PHILIP JOCELYN MET VERY OFTEN DURING THAT BRIGHT AUTUMNAL WEATHER
IT WAS A CLARENCE WITH DARK SUBDUED-LOOKING PANELS ONLY ORNAMENTED BY A VERMILION CREST
SHE WENT OUT AT THIS GATEWAY BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY POINT OF EGRESS BY WHICH SHE COULD LEAVE THE PARK WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE KEEPER OF A LODGE
GREAT HEAVEN
AND IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR HOME ALTOGETHER WITH US YOU SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE LESS NEARLY ALLIED TO ME THAN LAURA HERSELF WHEN HE MET ARTHUR AND THE TWO GIRLS AT THE DINNER-TABLE HENRY DUNBAR HAD QUITE RECOVERED FROM THE AGITATION OF THE MORNING AND TALKED GAILY OF THE FUTURE
WHERE THERE WAS A FAINT PERFUME OF PINE WOOD
THREE MINUTES AND A HALF THIS TIME AND LET THE WHITE SET TOLERABLY FIRM THIS LAST REMARK WAS ADDRESSED TO MRS SAWNEY TOM OR RATHER MRS THOMAS TIBBLES--SAWNEY TOM'S NAME WAS TIBBLES--WHO WAS STANDING BY THE FIRE BOILING EGGS AND TOASTING BREAD FOR HER HUSBAND'S PATRON
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT MISS LAURA
THE DIAMONDS WERE BOUGHT BUT THEY WERE NEVER MADE UP THE UNSET DIAMONDS WERE BOUGHT BY MR DUNBAR YES TO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT I BELIEVE
FOR LAURA DUNBAR WAS THERE
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF YOUR COMING TO THIS DOOR
THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASON FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER SENTIMENTS ABOUT HENRY DUNBAR
THE NOBLEMAN WHO MADE THE OFFER TO ARTHUR LOVELL HAD WRITTEN TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR AN IMMEDIATE DECISION
MR THOMAS TIBBLES WAS BY NO MEANS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE TEMPER IN THIS CHILL EARLY MORNING
RELY UPON IT MY GOOD FELLOW I'LL ATONE FOR THE PAST ATONE FOR THE PAST CRIED JOSEPH WILMOT
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE LIGHT IN THE ROOM FOR THE ONLY WINDOW LOOKED INTO A MINIATURE CONSERVATORY WHERE THERE WERE ALL MANNER OF PRICKLY AND SPIKY PLANTS OF THE CACTUS KIND WHICH HAD BEEN THE DELIGHT OF THE LATE OWNER OF WOODBINE COTTAGE
BUT HE IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
THAT IS ALL
AND THEN--THEN THE RICH MAN TREACHEROUS AND COLD-HEARTED IN HIS AGE AS IN HIS YOUTH HAD BEGUILED HIS OLD VALET BY A PRETENDED FRIENDSHIP HAD LURED HIM INTO A LONELY PLACE AND HAD THERE MURDERED HIM
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN SINS FALLING VERY HEAVILY UPON HIS HEAD HAD EMBITTERED HIS NATURE
THAT'S NOT VERY BUSINESS-LIKE IS IT MR AUSTIN
GOING AWAY XXX
THERE WERE THREE MEN ASLEEP UPON THESE SHELVES
HE PUT ON HIS HAT STILL SLOUCHING THE BRIM OVER HIS EYES PAID THE BARBER AND WENT AWAY
NO FURTHER DISCOVERY WAS MADE RESPECTING THE MURDER THAT HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN THE GROVE BETWEEN WINCHESTER AND ST CROSS
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IS A LARGE STAKE TO A POOR MAN
HAVE COMPASSION UPON ME FOR I NEED MAN'S MERCY AS WELL AS THE MERCY OF GOD
HE WAS AN OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY
YES MADGE
THE WAITER REMOVED THE COVER WITH AS LOFTY A FLOURISH AS IF THE SMALL SOLES HAD BEEN THE NOBLEST TURBOT THAT EVER MADE THE GLORY OF AN ALDERMANNIC FEAST
YOU GET A FRESH HORSE HARNESSED IN DOUBLE-QUICK TIME HE SAID AND DRIVE ME TO SHORNCLIFFE STATION WHILE THE HORSE AND FLY WERE BEING GOT READY THE DETECTIVE WENT INTO THE BAR AND ORDERED A GLASS OF STEAMING BRANDY-AND-WATER
BUT I KNOW THAT HE LOVED ME AND HE WAS VERY DEAR TO ME
I SHALL GO MAD IF I AM NOT LEFT ALONE CLEMENT AUSTIN ROSE FROM HIS SEAT NEAR THE BEDSIDE
BUT FOR THE WRETCH HIMSELF SURELY LONG YEARS OF PENITENCE MUST MAKE A BETTER EXPIATION OF HIS GUILT THAN THAT ONE SHORT AGONY--THOSE FEW SPASMODIC THROES WHICH RENDER HIS DEATH SUCH A PLEASANT SPECTACLE FOR A SIGHT-SEEING POPULACE
YOU'LL THINK ME IMPERTINENT PERHAPS BUT I HOPE YOU'LL BELIEVE THAT I'M ONLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MAN ANXIOUS TO DO MY DUTY IN MY OWN LINE OF LIFE AND TO DO IT WITH CONSIDERATION FOR ALL PARTIES
THEY'VE BEEN DRIFTED AWAY INTO ONE OF THE DEEPEST HOLES THERE IS AND THE RATS HAVE BEEN GNAWING AT EM
HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE HE SAID
AND I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE AND PERPLEXITY
MR DUNBAR'S WORDS SEEMED TO EMANATE FROM THE KIND AND GENEROUS BREAST OF A GOOD MAN
MR CARTER WAS RIGHT
THE WINCHESTER MURDER
SIR PHILIP WAS A SPORTSMAN BUT HE DID NOT HUNT IN DREAMS AND HE WAS PREPARED TO HOLD HIS WIFE A GREAT DEAL HIGHER THAN HIS HORSE WHENEVER HE SHOULD WIN THAT PLEASANT ADDITION TO HIS HOUSEHOLD
BUT AS HE WAS AN IDLE PURPOSELESS MAN WITHOUT FRIENDS TO VISIT OR MONEY TO SPEND HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE THE RAILWAY STATION
A COOLING LOTION APPLIED WITH LINEN CLOTHS MUST BE KEPT ON ALL NIGHT
IT WAS A VERY SMALL TREASURE FOR A LOVER TO PRESERVE PERHAPS
AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY XLII
I AM A POOR WEAK FOOL HE SAID QUIETLY
I AM SOMETHING OF SHAKSPEARE'S OPINION
SUCCESS IS THE VERY WINE OF LIFE AND IT WAS SCARCELY STRANGE THAT MR CARTER SHOULD FEEL PLEASED AT HAVING SUCCEEDED IN FINDING A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY BAFFLED HIS COLLEAGUES
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT ELIZABETH MRS MADDEN WAS BUSTLING ABOUT ARRANGING HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S BREAKFAST UPON A LITTLE TABLE NEAR THE BLAZING FIRE
HE PROMISED WELL
I HAVE ALWAYS RIDICULED WHAT PEOPLE CALL LOVE AT SIGHT HE THOUGHT
I AM GOING TO MEET THAT MAN FACE TO FACE HER BREATH CAME IN FAINT GASPS AND THE FIRELIT CHAMBER SWAM BEFORE HER EYES AS SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THAT DOOR AND WENT INTO THE ROOM WHERE HENRY DUNBAR WAS SITTING ALONE BEFORE THE LOW FIRE
THERE'S NO CALL TO FLY AT ME
NONE I AM GOING OUT FOR A STROLL PRESENTLY
HE WAS SITTING ALL THE TIME OF COURSE
DARK THOUGHTS CAME BACK UPON HIS MIND AND THE SHADOWS DEEPENED ON HIS FACE AS HE GAVE ONE RAPID GLANCE ROUND THE FAMILIAR OFFICE
DEAR BRADSHAW WHAT AN INTERESTING WRITER YOU SEEMED TO ME ON THAT DAY
MARGARET'S RETURN
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MURDERED MAN'S CLOTHES HAD ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS IRRECONCILABLE WITH THE IDEA OF HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT
HE WAS A RESPECTABLE HANDSOME-LOOKING GENTLEMAN ADVANCED IN MIDDLE AGE
OR LET ME RATHER SAY HENRY DUNBAR REVEALED NO TASTE IN COMMON WITH THOSE OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE HIGHEST HOPE IN LIFE WAS TO BE HIS SON-IN-LAW
AND THE LOSS OF IT HAD PREYED UPON HIS MIND AND HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SETTLED MELANCHOLY LIKE AND WAS NEVER SEEN TO SMILE THE WOMAN OPENED A DRAWER AS SHE TALKED TO ME AND AFTER TURNING OVER SOME PAPERS TOOK OUT A CARD--A CARD WITH EMBOSSED EDGES FLY-SPOTTED AND DUSTY AND WITH A LITTLE FADED BLUE RIBBON ATTACHED TO IT--A CARD ON WHICH THERE WAS WRITTEN IN THE HAND I KNEW SO WELL AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MISS WILSON OF THE HERMITAGE WOULD GIVE INSTRUCTION IN MUSIC AND SINGING FOR A GUINEA A QUARTER
IT'S HUMILIATING TO AN OFFICER OF MY STANDING IN THE FORCE
AND I SHALL BE GLAD IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME DIRECTLY YOU HAVE ATTENDED TO THE LUGGAGE
THERE WAS GAS LAID ON IN THE MILLIONAIRE'S STABLES AND A LOW JET HAD BEEN LEFT BURNING BY THE GROOM
THE WATER GUSHED OUT OF THE QUAINT DRAGONS MOUTHS RANGED ALONG THE PARAPET OF THE ABBEY ROOF
AM I SORRY FOR HIM
SHE WAS TIRED AND UNHAPPY AND SHE STOOD IN A MELANCHOLY ATTITUDE LOOKING WITH SAD EYES TOWARDS THE GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LANE
THE GIRL IS AN IMPOSTOR
MY FORMER LIFE HAS BEEN SUCH AN UNHAPPY ONE THAT I TREMBLE AT THE THOUGHT OF LINKING IT TO YOURS
AND THOUGH I ASK YOU BOTH WHERE YOU ARE GOING YOU BOTH REFUSE TO SATISFY MY VERY NATURAL CURIOSITY AND LOOK AS SOLEMN AS IF YOU WERE ABOUT TO ATTEND A FUNERAL
I'M ONLY GOING TO LOOK ABOUT ME
HE RECEIVES ME GRACIOUSLY ENOUGH AND TREATS ME WITH POLITENESS
THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING
BUT HE WAS NOT A MAN WHO ALWAYS KEPT HIS PROMISES
THE FROST HAD SET IN FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR
I'M GOING DOWN TO THE RESIDENT MAGISTRATE MR AUSTIN
I'LL TRUST YOU MARGARET SAID JOSEPH WILMOT LOOSENING HIS GRASP UPON THE GIRL'S SHOULDER
AND NOW SIR WITH REGARD TO THE DESIGN OF THE NECKLACE SAID THE MERCHANT WHEN HE HAD FOLDED THE CHEQUE AND PUT IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET
HE MET HER THERE VERY OFTEN
BUT THE GLOOM WAS NOT TO BE PIERCED EVEN BY THE SHARPEST EYES
THE POOR FELLOW AMUSED ME BY OLD MEMORIES OF THE PAST ON THE ROAD BETWEEN SOUTHAMPTON AND THIS PLACE AND WE THEREFORE TALKED VERY LITTLE OF THE PRESENT SAMPSON MUST BE VERY ILL EXCLAIMED MR BALDERBY OR HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RETURNED TO ST GUNDOLPH LANE TO TELL ME WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE MR DUNBAR SMILED
LAURA HAD JUST EMERGED FROM HER BATH ROOM AND HAD PUT ON A LOOSE DRESSING-GOWN OF WADDED BLUE SILK PRIOR TO THE GRAND CEREMONIAL OF THE WEDDING TOILET WHICH WAS NOT TO TAKE PLACE UNTIL AFTER BREAKFAST
HE SUCCEEDS PERHAPS FOR A TIME AND IS TRUSTED AND BEING HONESTLY DISPOSED AT HEART IS HONEST
COUNTRY PEOPLE KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBOURS
HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS PAID THE MONEY FOR HIS SUPPER AND NIGHT'S LODGING TO A SLEEPY SERVANT-GIRL AND LEFT THE HOUSE AS THE CHURCH-CLOCK IN AN OLD-FASHIONED SQUARE HARD BY STRUCK EIGHT
POOR DESOLATE GIRL HE THOUGHT POOR LONELY ORPHAN GIRL BUT HE THOUGHT STILL MORE ABOUT THAT WHICH HE HAD HEARD OF HENRY DUNBAR
THE SAME WAITER WAS LOUNGING IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL
WHEN THE COUNTY GENTRY CAME TO WELCOME HIM TO ENGLAND HE RECEIVED THEM AND THANKED THEM FOR THEIR COURTESY
FOR HE CAN NO LONGER ESCAPE AND SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN SERVANTS HE WILL SCARCELY DARE TO REFUSE TO SEE ME
WHEN ONCE THEY TAKE AN ECCENTRIC TURN THERE'S NO KNOWING WHERE TO HAVE EM MAJOR VERNON SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
BUT I'M REALLY AFRAID THIS IS A CASE IN WHICH THE MURDERER WILL ESCAPE FROM JUSTICE WHY SO BECAUSE YOU SEE SIR THE MAN HAS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO GET OFF
JOHN LOVELL WILL BE THERE TO MEET YOU THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY
HE HAD LOOKED UPON IT AS A CRUEL SCANDAL WHICH HAD PERHAPS ARISEN OUT OF SOME TRIFLING ERROR SOME UNPAID DEBT OF HONOUR
THERE WAS NO PROBABLE MOTIVE WHICH COULD INDUCE HENRY DUNBAR THE VERY PINK OF RESPECTABILITY AND SOLE OWNER OF A MILLION OF MONEY TO RUN THE RISK OF THE GALLOWS
BUT WITH WHATEVER AMBITIOUS DESIGN THE SOJOURNER BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT DINNER IT ALWAYS ENDED SOMEHOW OR OTHER BY HIS ORDERING A CHICKEN A LITTLE BIT OF BOILED BACON A DISH OF CUTLETS AND A TART
BUT THERE'S ONE THING IN WHICH YOU'VE BEEN UNLIKE THE REST OF YOUR SEX AND WHAT'S THAT FATHER YOU'VE SHOWN NO CURIOSITY
SHE FOLDED UP THIS PAPER AND HANDED IT TO MARGARET
I DON'T WANT TO STAY IN SOUTHAMPTON ALL DAY JOSEPH WILMOT RANG AND ORDERED THE TIME-TABLE
AND THE MONEY I'VE HAD TO-DAY IS THE LAST I SHALL EVER RECEIVE FROM THAT QUARTER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAJOR VERNON'S DEPARTURE HENRY DUNBAR RANG THE BELL FOR THE SERVANT WHO ACTED AS HIS VALET WHENEVER HE REQUIRED THE SERVICES OF ONE WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN
TRUST ME MR AUSTIN MY COMPANION SAID
I WISH LAURA TO MARRY HE SAID
AND A BREAKFAST AND MORNING CONCERT ON THE LAWN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE URGENT ENTREATIES OF THE SAME YOUNG LADY
HE HAD NOT TO WAIT LONG
THE MOTIVES THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE OTHER MEN COULD HAVE HAD NO WEIGHT WITH HIM
WIVES SHRIEKING FOR THEIR HUSBANDS
A PERSIAN CARPET COVERED THE CENTRE OF THE FLOOR AND BEYOND ITS FRINGED MARGIN A TESSELLATED PAVEMENT OF COLOURED MARBLES TOOK NEW AND BRIGHTER HUES FROM THE SLANTING RAYS OF SUNLIGHT THAT STREAMED IN THROUGH A WIDE STAINED-GLASS WINDOW UPON THE STAIRCASE
OF COURSE HE DID
I THOUGHT YOU'D FORGOTTEN YOUR PARCEL SIR THE MAN SAID
SHE FOLLOWED HER FATHER INTO THE GARDEN AND WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOOSE BOX WHERE THE HORSE WAS TO BE FOUND
BECAUSE YOU SEE WORKING IN THE TWILIGHT ISN'T MUCH MORE PROFITABLE THAN WORKING IN THE DARK
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS THOROUGHLY AT HOME WITH HIS PATRON
HE RAN ALONG THE PLATFORM LOOKING INTO THE CARRIAGES
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE JEWELS
AND SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS A MODEL OF ALL THAT IS NOBLE AND CHIVALROUS
IT WAS TO BE A VERY QUIET WEDDING
THANK YOU FOR NOTHING AND OTHER SENTENCES OF A DERISIVE CHARACTER
THE SHAME CLEMENT--THINK OF THAT
BLOOD HAS BEEN SHED FOR THE SAKE OF SOME PRIZE SO SMALL SO PALTRY THAT IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR MEN TO BELIEVE THAT ONE HUMAN BEING COULD DESTROY ANOTHER FOR SUCH AN OBJECT
SHE INTERRUPTED HIM BY ASKING FOR MR KERSTALL'S ADDRESS
AND WHEN THE PARCEL HAD SUNK HE WATCHED THE WIDENING CIRCLE UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER TILL IT DIED AWAY
THE DOTING GRANDFATHER HAD TAKEN A DELIGHT IN BEAUTIFYING THE APARTMENTS OCCUPIED BY HIS GIRLISH COMPANION
THERE'LL BE EVERY EFFORT MADE DEPEND UPON IT
I WAS TEMPTED TO DO IT BY ANOTHER
I HAVE WAITED TO SEE MR DUNBAR WELL THAT'S QUEER SAID THE WAITER
FOR A LITTLE JET OF VIVID LIGHT LEAPED UP OUT OF THE SMOULDERING LOG AND LIGHTED THE SCARED FACE OF THE BANKER
THE VERGER LOOKED AT THE WATCH TOO
HIS COMPLEXION HAD FADED TO A DULL LEADEN HUE
I CAN TALK TO YOU COMFORTABLY AFTER DINNER TA-TA THEN OLD BOY
AT A QUARTER TO FIVE THE FLY STOPPED AT THE LODGE-GATES
I SUBMITTED HOWEVER TO TAKE THE THREE DAYS HOLIDAY
NO MY BROTHER SAID LOOKING CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THE CORNET
SHE ONLY KNEW THAT HE CALLED HIMSELF JAMES WENTWORTH
IT AIN'T OFTEN THAT A MURDERER CARES TO STOP LONGER THAN HE'S OBLIGED BY THE SIDE OF HIS VICTIM
THERE WAS NO MOCK SOLEMNITY IN HIS TONE NOW
AND WHEN YOU POOR CHILD TRY TO READ IT TO ME THERE'S SOME DEVIL RISES IN MY BREAST AND SHUTS MY EARS AGAINST THE WORDS
WHICH WAY WILL THE BOY GO
THEN MR HUGH DUNBAR TURNED TO HIS NEPHEW
THERE WERE NO VEHICLES TO BE HAD AT THAT EARLY HOUR OF THE MORNING SO MR CARTER WAS FAIN TO WALK FROM THE QUAY TO THE STATION WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND MR TIBBLES OR TO OBTAIN TIDINGS OF THAT GENTLEMAN
A BRIGHT ARRAY OF GLASS AND SILVER GLITTERED UNDER THE LIGHT OF FIVE WAX-CANDLES IN A SILVER CANDELABRUM
THE GROOM SLEPT IN THE HOUSE NOW BY HIS MASTER'S ORDERS AND THERE WAS NO ONE WITHIN HEARING
TO KNOW ANYBODY WHO KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT JOSEPH WILMOT'S MURDER WAS TO OCCUPY A POST OF SOME DISTINCTION IN WINCHESTER JUST NOW
TELL THIS PERSON MARGARET WILMOT THAT I REFUSE TO SEE HER TO-DAY AS I REFUSED TO SEE HER IN PORTLAND PLACE AND AS I REFUSED TO SEE HER AT WINCHESTER HE SAID DELIBERATELY
HENRY DUNBAR GENERALLY RODE EITHER EARLY IN THE MORNING OR IN THE GREY TWILIGHT AFTER HIS DINNER-HOUR
MARGARET HAS NOT ACTED AS A FREE AGENT
I TOLD HIM IT COULDN'T BE DONE SIR
BUT IT WOULDN'T DO FOR HIS LIPS TREMBLED SO THAT IT WAS PAINFUL TO WATCH HIM
BUT THERE WAS A RISK IN EMPLOYING HIM
REMEMBER THAT I AM A STRANGER TO ENGLISH HABITS
IT WAS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD SIT CALMLY BY THE FIRE WAITING FOR THE COMING OF THE GIRL HE LOVED
CAN I BE OF ANY SERVICE TO YOU SIR HE ASKED RESPECTFULLY
HIS WHITE FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE LANDLORD'S FIXED IN A BLANK STARE
WHO'LL CATCH HER CRIED MR CARTER
AND THAT DEATH HAD ULTIMATELY BEEN CAUSED BY STRANGLING AND SUFFOCATION
THE BELL RANG FOR THE STARTING OF THE TRAIN
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I HAD DREAMT THE SAME DREAM,--THE BRIGHT HAPPY DREAM IN WHICH MY FATHER CAME HOME TO ME THE FOND FOOLISH DREAM IN WHICH I FELT HIS STRONG ARMS FOLDED ROUND ME AND HIS TRUE HEART BEATING AGAINST MY OWN
HE ALSO MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FOR COPENHAGEN--A BLACK SULKY-LOOKING BOAT CHRISTENED VERY APPROPRIATELY THE CROW WITH A BLACK SULKY-LOOKING CAPTAIN WHO WAS LYING ON A HEAP OF TARPAULIN ON THE DECK SMOKING A PIPE IN HIS SLEEP
NO MR BALDERBY I HAVE ONLY BEEN A MAN OF BUSINESS BECAUSE ALL CHANCE OF ANOTHER CAREER WHICH I INFINITELY PREFERRED WAS CLOSED UPON ME FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
WHAT A SHALLOW MISERABLE FOOL
HE HAD NO VISITORS EXCEPT THE SURGEON MR DAPHNEY WHO LIVED IN THE ABBEY AND A GENTLEMAN CALLED VERNON WHO HAD BOUGHT WOODBINE COTTAGE NEAR LISFORD AND WHO NOW AND THEN WAS ADMITTED TO MR DUNBAR'S SITTING-ROOM
I DO
WHAT'S THE MATTER HE ASKED
THOSE SUNDAYS WERE PLEASANT DAYS TO CLEMENT AND THE GIRL WHOM HE HOPED TO WIN FOR HIS WIFE
WHY SHOULD YOU
HE WORE A GREAT COAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER AND MOST PEOPLE FOUND THE WEATHER INSUPPORTABLY HOT
SHALL I SEE AFTER YOUR LUGGAGE YES I SHALL BE GLAD IF YOU WILL DO SO YOU HAVE A SERVANT WITH YOU MR DUNBAR NO MY VALET WAS TAKEN ILL AT MALTA AND I LEFT HIM BEHIND INDEED EXCLAIMED JOSEPH WILMOT
THAT GENTLEMAN WAS STANDING ON THE PLATFORM WATCHING THE PASSENGERS STEP OUT OF THE CARRIAGES AND LOOKING MORE TURNIP-FACED THAN USUAL IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THE PLACE IS PRETTY WELL KNOWN IT WAS NEARLY FIVE O'CLOCK BY THIS TIME
THAT IS THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL--I AM NOT MAD
THE LIVERIES OF THE SERVANTS WERE ALMOST THE SIMPLEST UPON THE COURSE
BUT THE MAN WHO STOOD BY HER SIDE HAD NO WORD OF COMFORT TO SAY TO HER
BUT THE SIGH WAS HABITUAL TO HIM AND HE APOLOGIZED FOR AND EXPLAINED IT SOMETIMES BY REFERENCE TO HIS LIVER WHICH WAS DISORDERED BY FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS IN AN INDIAN CLIMATE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
HE WENT STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE VERY PLACE WHERE--THE MURDER WAS DONE
IT WAS ONE O'CLOCK ON A BRIGHT SUNSHINY DAY AND THE HEART OF MR CARTER THE DETECTIVE BEAT HIGH WITH EXPECTATION OF A GREAT TRIUMPH
BUT THE FAINT STROKES OF LISFORD-CHURCH CLOCK DIED AWAY UPON THE COLD EVENING WIND AND CLEMENT WAS STILL PACING UP AND DOWN AND THE FLY WAS STILL WAITING
FOR HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY THE CARELESS MANNER IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR HAD SPOKEN OF HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER
AND FOR THE THREE AND A HALF WEARY HOURS THAT MUST INTERVENE MR CARTER WAS LEFT TO AMUSE HIMSELF AS BEST HE MIGHT
BUT MISS MACMAHON DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SIGNIFICANT GLANCE
HE HAD SHUNNED HER PRESENCE FROM THE FIRST
AND THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM VERY MUCH THROUGH HER NOSE THAT MR KERSTALL FATHER SAW NO ONE
IF YOU CAME HERE UPON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT WITH A VIEW TO TERRIFY ME OR TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ME YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
A POUND A WEEK
LADY JOCELYN WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE PICTURES YOU HAVE SCATTERED ABOUT IN THIS ROOM MY DEAR FATHER HE SAID IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO OUR TURNING THEM OVER THE OLD MAN CHUCKLED AND NODDED
THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI BY CARAVAGGIO
I SUPPOSE YOU'D LIKE SOME TALLOW-DROPS SIR HE SAID
AH YES
WHY DID YOU TELL THE DECEASED TO JOIN YOU AT THE CATHEDRAL MR DUNBAR MERELY BECAUSE IT SUITED MY HUMOUR AT THE TIME TO DO SO ANSWERED THE ANGLO-INDIAN COOLLY
TO SEEK TO WIN LOVE FROM HIM WAS ABOUT AS HOPELESS AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASK ALMS OF A MAN WHOSE PURSE WAS EMPTY
IF THEN HE DID NOT FLINCH OR FALTER IF SHE SAW INNOCENCE IN HIS FACE SHE WOULD CEASE TO DOUBT HIM SHE WOULD BE CONTENT TO BELIEVE THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD MET HIS UNTIMELY DEATH FROM A STRANGER'S HAND
HENRY DUNBAR DREW BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAKING THAT VERY BRIEF SALUTE TO THE POPULACE
AND SCANTY PATCHES OF WOODLAND WHERE THE HARDY FIRS LOOKED BLACK AGAINST THE GLITTERING WHITENESS OF THE GROUND
IF I HAVE NOT DONE SO DEAR FATHER SHE ANSWERED GENTLY IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE I KNEW YOUR SECRET MUST BE A PAINFUL ONE
ONLY BY INDUCTION WAS THE IDENTITY OF HENRY DUNBAR EVER ESTABLISHED
THE DOCTOR ARRIVED IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES
HAD HE ACTUALLY SET OUT UPON THAT JOURNEY
HE HAD PUT THE MONEY THE KEYS AND THE MEMORANDUM-BOOK IN ONE OF HIS OWN POCKETS
I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN MY BLESSING LAURA HE SAID ALOUD
TO-DAY I CLOSE A VOLUME OF THE ROUGH CARELESS IMPERFECT RECORD WHICH I HAVE KEPT OF MY LIFE
WHEN EVER WAS THE EARNEST REQUEST OF A MILLIONAIRE REFUSED
ONE OF THEM HAD KNELT DOWN UPON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM TO GET A DRINK OF WATER IN THE CROWN OF HIS FELT HAT AND HAD BEEN HORRIFIED BY SEEING THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN LOOKING UP AT HIM IN THE MOONLIGHT THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER THAT BARELY COVERED IT
I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A NURSE AND MY ASSISTANT WILL ALSO REMAIN HERE ALL NIGHT TO SUPERVISE HER MOVEMENTS THE BANKER GROANED ALOUD
HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLASPED HIS TWO HANDS UPON HIS FOREHEAD TRYING TO THINK WHO THE LATE VISITANT COULD BE
PUT ON YOUR SPECTACLES SAMPSON WILMOT HE SAID AND LOOK HARD AT ME AND THEN TELL ME IF I AM A STRANGER TO YOU THE OLD CLERK OBEYED NERVOUSLY FEARFULLY
THE PICTURED FACE BORE NO TRACE OF RESEMBLANCE TO THAT FACE FOR WHICH LAURA WAS LOOKING
WHAT IF HENRY DUNBAR SHOULD HAVE DIED UPON THE PASSAGE HOME
HE REACHED THE STATION THREE MINUTES BEFORE THE TRAIN WAS DUE AND TOOK HIS TICKET
I FELT ALMOST MADDENED WITH THIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND VEXATION
MISS CARPENTER WAS STUPID ABOUT BOOKS AND USED TO CALL CARLYLE NONSENSICAL
THERE IS LITTLE ENOUGH DIFFERENCE AS IT IS PERHAPS HE SAID
THE YOUNG LAWYER HAD HEARD THE STORY OF THE FORGERY VAGUELY HINTED AT BY THOSE WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY
THE PEOPLE AT THE VILLAGE INN TOLD HIM THAT THE OLD MAN HAD DIED AT TWO O'CLOCK UPON THE MORNING OF THE 17TH ONLY A FEW HOURS AFTER HIS BROTHER'S DESERTION OF HIM
DISTINCTION HAD COME TO HIM UNSOUGHT
AND IT WAS ONLY ON A SECOND PRODUCTION OF THE WARRANT THAT MR CARTER OBTAINED THE LOAN OF A WRETCHED SPLUTTERING WICK GLIMMERING IN A DIRTY LITTLE OIL-LAMP
THERE WAS A BED IN A CURTAINED ALCOVE AT THE END OF THE APARTMENT
CHAPTER XIV
HAD HE DONE WRONG IN SEEKING TO BRING ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW BETWEEN MARGARET WILMOT AND HENRY DUNBAR
BUT UNHAPPILY GOOD MEN ARE APT TO FLY INTO PASSIONS AS WELL AS THEIR INFERIORS IN THE SCALE OF MORALITY
AND SHE DID NOT GROW TIRED OF THE PLEASANT HOME THAT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HER
BRING A LAWYER WITH YOU
I DELEGATED ALL OUR ARRANGEMENTS TO MY COMPANION
BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE HEART
BUT IN THAT CASE WHERE HAD SHE GONE
SHE HAD HER WHOLE STOCK OF MONEY WITH HER BUT NOTHING ELSE
WHO COULD REALLY ATTEND TO THE COMMON BUSINESS OF EATING AND DRINKING ON SUCH A DAY AS THIS
I CAN'T SEE THAT ANY GOOD CAN COME OF IT NEVER YOU MIND WHAT COMES OF IT
HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN IN HIS ESTIMATE OF HUMAN NATURE
AND OVER ALL THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT CATHEDRAL BROODS LIKE A SHELTERING WING PRESERVING THE COOL QUIET OF THESE COSY SANCTUARIES
I TOLD YOU AS MUCH HE MURMURED CONFIDENTIALLY
HE MAY HAVE GIVEN THOSE CLOTHES TO HIS OLD VALET THAT'S NOT LIKELY SIR
AND AMONGST THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIS TALK WAS ONE OF THE CONSTABLES--A SHARP CLEAR-HEADED FELLOW--WHO WAS ON THE WATCH FOR ANY HINT THAT MIGHT POINT TO THE SECRET OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DEATH
NOTES FROM A JOURNAL KEPT BY CLEMENT AUSTIN DURING HIS JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER XXXIX
THERE'S A SALE COMES OFF NEXT THURSDAY
AND THE PAPER HAD BEEN BOUGHT THERE--AND IF SO IT WAS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT MARGARET HAD BEEN THERE
THE SPOT UPON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THAT SPOT HAD BEEN DILIGENTLY SEARCHED
MARGARET TOLD US OF HER FATHER'S PENITENCE
I CONSIDER THAT I HAVE BEEN HARSHLY TREATED
BY-AND-BY HE TOOK THE BUNCH OF KEYS FROM HIS POCKET KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE PORTMANTEAU AND EXAMINED ITS CONTENTS
W THIS WAS ALL
HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
BUT THE ENGINE-DRIVER HAD BEEN KILLED AND SEVERAL OF THE PASSENGERS SEVERELY INJURED
AND CONSIDER THIS A LUCKY ESCAPE JOSEPH TURNED UPON THE BANKER WITH HIS FACE ALL IN A CRIMSON FLAME AND HIS EYES FLASHING FIRE
BY THE BYE MISS WENTWORTH EXCLAIMED MRS AUSTIN BREAKING IN UPON CLEMENT'S DISQUISITION ON HIS FAVOURITE CARLYLE'S HERO-WORSHIP I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS DREADFUL MURDER THAT IS MAKING SUCH A SENSATION A DREADFUL MURDER--NO MRS AUSTIN
BUT THE EVIDENCE OF THE TWO MEN TALLIED IN EVERY PARTICULAR
THE HOUSE GOT ON VERY WELL WITHOUT HIS AID
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THE SETTLEMENTS BY-THE-BYE
OF COURSE THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS SO WORDED AS TO GIVE NO CLUE TO THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED
MY MOTHER IS VERY FOND OF YOU
A THIS ADVERTISEMENT WAS AS USELESS AS ITS PREDECESSOR
HE WISHED HER TO MARRY WHOM SHE PLEASED
THE LONGER CLEMENT AUSTIN DELIBERATED UPON THIS BUSINESS THE MORE CERTAINLY HE CAME TO THAT ONE TERRIBLE CONCLUSION
THE LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO HENRY DUNBAR AND SEALED WITH THE OFFICIAL SEAL OF THE BANKING-HOUSE
NOW THAT THE MEETING HAD COME TO PASS HE LOOKED AT HENRY DUNBAR WITH AN EARNEST SCRUTINIZING GAZE AS IF HE WOULD FAIN HAVE DISCOVERED THE SECRET OF THE MAN'S GUILT OR INNOCENCE IN HIS COUNTENANCE
I'LL WRITE TO YOUR MASTER THE MAJOR SAID AFTER A PAUSE
THE ROOMS WERE SMALLER AND SNUGGER THAN THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBERS OCCUPIED BY THE BANKER
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE HIGH STREET AND ENTERED THE SHOP OF A TAILOR AND GENERAL OUTFITTER
YOU LEAVE THIS BUSINESS TO ME MR AUSTIN AND DON'T YOU GO JUMPING AT CONCLUSIONS
HE STILL HOLDS TO HIS PROMISE AND WILL GIVE YOU THE PREFERENCE
I HOPE I AM NOT TOO LATE SIR SHE SAID
IT'S A DOLEFUL WALK TO TAKE ALONE AT THAT TIME OF THE EVENING TO BE SURE THOUGH SOME FOLKS THINK IT'S THE PLEASANTEST WALK IN ALL KYLMINGTON IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT I FOUND MYSELF UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE TREES WHILE THE KYLMINGTON CLOCK WAS STRIKING EIGHT
THE LANDLORD OF THE GEORGE MURMURED A FEW STEREOTYPED PHRASES EXPRESSIVE OF HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE WRONGS OF HENRY DUNBAR AND HIS ENTIRE REPROBATION OF THE MISSING MAN'S CONDUCT
IN THAT CASE THOUGHT THE MAJOR AS HE WENT BACK TO THE RING I SHALL SLEEP AT LISFORD TO-NIGHT
PERHAPS NOT SIR BUT IT MAY BE GOSPEL TRUTH FOR ALL THAT
HE WALKED ALONG THE SHORE UNTIL HE CAME TO A VILLAGE NEAR THE RIVER AND ABOUT A COUPLE OF MILES FROM SOUTHAMPTON
ONE OF THE BANKER'S LEGS WAS BROKEN AND HE HAD RECEIVED A BLOW UPON THE HEAD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM IMMEDIATELY UNCONSCIOUS
I WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER INTO A CONFESSION OF THE TRUTH BY THE GOOD-NATURED JUNIOR PARTNER WHO LIVED NEAR US ON CLAPHAM COMMON AND WHO DROPPED IN SOMETIMES AS HE WENT BY MY MOTHER'S GATE TO WHILE AWAY AN IDLE HALF-HOUR IN SOME POLITICAL DISCUSSION
I WAS A POOR DESOLATE GIRL
I KNOW LAURA DUNBAR--THAT IS TO SAY LADY JOCELYN--AND IT IS TOO HORRIBLE TO ME TO IMAGINE THAT HER FATHER IS GUILTY OF THIS CRIME
YOU HAVE NO OCCASION TO LEAVE THIS PLACE
IT WAS SUCH A FACE AS MIGHT HAVE BELONGED TO THE FAVOURITE OF A POWERFUL KING
THERE ARE ALWAYS ECCENTRIC PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND APPEARANCES ARE VERY APT TO BE DECEPTIVE
AND PEOPLE THINK IT A VERY SMALL THING THAT AFTER HAVING LED A RECKLESS LIFE HE SHOULD DIE A CRUEL DEATH
HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED
FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT
HE HAD A LOOSE BOX BUILT ON PURPOSE FOR THE ANIMAL IN A PRIVATE GARDEN ADJOINING HIS OWN DRESSING-ROOM WHICH LIKE THE REST OF HIS APARTMENTS WAS SITUATED UPON THE GROUND-FLOOR OF THE ABBEY
THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN DRAWN CLOSE UP TO THE BOUNDARY OF THE COURSE AND LAURA SAT AT THE OPEN WINDOW PALE AND ANXIOUS STRAINING HER EYES TOWARDS THE WEIGHING-HOUSE AND THE PADDOCK THE LITTLE BIT OF ENCLOSED GROUND WHERE THE HORSES WERE SADDLED
THE REMAINS WERE REMOVED FROM WINCHESTER TO LISFORD CHURCH WHERE PERCIVAL DUNBAR WAS BURIED IN A VAULT BENEATH THE CHANCEL
I WANT A COMPLETE RIG-OUT FROM HEAD TO HEEL
THE NEXT AND PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT WITNESSES WERE THE TWO LABOURERS PHILIP MURTOCK AND PATRICK HENNESSY WHO HAD FOUND THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN
MAKE IT TWO FIVE PRINCE OF MAUDESLEY THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO RECORD THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN
IT WAS EXHIBITED IN THE ACADEMY SIX-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO--YES BY GAD SIR SIX-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
LAURA RESEMBLES HER MOTHER WHO WAS A LOVELY WOMAN BUT I HAVE HEARD YOUR FATHER SAY THAT THE LOWER PART OF MISS DUNBAR'S FACE--THE MOUTH AND CHIN--REMINDED HIM OF YOURS
EXCEPT WHAT BRIGMAWL DROPPED OUT ONE NIGHT AT SUPPER SOME WEEKS AFTER THE INQUEST ABOUT HIS HAVING NOTICED MR DUNBAR OPENING HIS DESK WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR JOSEPH WILMOT TO COME HOME TO DINNER
THE ROPE AND THE SLIP-KNOT THE TREACHEROUS RUNNING NOOSE HINTED DARKLY AT ORIENTAL EXPERIENCES
SHE FOUND A WAITER LOUNGING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE HOTEL
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THE YOUNG LADY HAS LEFT SHE HAVE LEFT ABOVE A HOUR AGO SHE WENT AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE AN HOUR AGO MORE THAN A HOUR AGO IMPOSSIBLE CLEMENT SAID
IT WOULD BE SOME CONSOLATION SOME SUPPORT TO HAVE HIM WITH HER
BUT I'VE NO DOUBT YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST YES I HAVE DONE MY BEST THE ASSISTANT ANSWERED RATHER INDIGNANTLY
A THRILL OF RAPTURE RAN THROUGH THE BANKER'S VEINS AS HE PLUNGED HIS FINGERS IN AMONGST THE GLITTERING STONES
BUT BUT WHAT
WHY MR HENRY DUNBAR WAS DISMISSED FROM CUSTODY ONLY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND IS GOING UP TO TOWN BY THE EXPRESS THIS NIGHT AND EVERYBODY IN WINCHESTER IS FULL OF THE SHAMEFUL WAY IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN TREATED
MRS MARSTON IS A STRANGER TO ME
YOU ARE FREE TO GO
WE SHALL SAVE TIME BY YOUR GOING
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SOUTHAMPTON WHAT FOR TO MEET HENRY DUNBAR JOSEPH WILMOT'S FACE GREW LIVID WITH RAGE
THE HIGH STREET WAS VERY QUIET A LAMP GLIMMERED HERE AND THERE AND THE PAVEMENTS WERE WHITE IN THE MOONLIGHT
LEARN THE ALPHABET OF THE CASE AND WORK UP INTO THE SYNTAX AND PROSODY I SHOULD LIKE TO HELP YOU IN THIS BUSINESS CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID FOR I HAVE A VITAL INTEREST IN THE ISSUE OF THE CASE YOU'RE RATHER MORE LIKELY TO HINDER THAN HELP SIR MR CARTER ANSWERED WITH A SMILE
I THINK SAWNEY IS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ME TO TRY THAT ON THE FLY CAME ROUND TO THE INN-DOOR WHILE MR CARTER REFLECTED UPON THIS
THEN AS THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF SOME HOURS BEFORE THE STARTING OF ANOTHER HE RE-CROSSED THE WATER AND SET TO WORK TO LOOK FOR HIS MAN
FROM WINDOW-LEDGE AND PORCH FROM GABLE-END AND SHELTERING IVY
IT IS VERY USUAL FOR A WITNESS EVEN THE MOST INDIFFERENT WITNESS GIVING EVIDENCE ABOUT SOME TRIFLING MATTER TO BE CONFUSED TO FALTER AND HESITATE AND CONTRADICT HIMSELF EMBARRASSED BY THE STRANGENESS OF HIS POSITION
HE OPENED HIS EYES WIDELY ENOUGH THIS TIME AND STARTED AT THE HANDSOME FACE BEFORE HIM
SHE WAITED FIVE MINUTES OR SO
IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE YOUNG LAWYER MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE PLEASANT MORNING-ROOM OCCUPIED BY LAURA DUNBAR WHENEVER SHE STAYED IN PORTLAND PLACE
AND SHE SHOWED HIM THE LETTER WHICH WAS DIRECTED TO NORFOLK ISLAND--THAT LETTER IN WHICH THE OLD CLERK ALLUDED TO THE POWER THAT HIS BROTHER POSSESSED OVER HIS LATE MASTER
I SPOKE TO THE CORONER UPON THAT SUBJECT THIS AFTERNOON
THE GIRL HURRIED TO THE DOOR WITH A LIGHT STEP SO LIGHT UPON THE SMOOTH SOLID GRAVEL THAT THE FOOTMAN HEARD NOTHING UNTIL SHE WAS ON THE BROAD STONE STEP UNDER THE PORCH WHEN THE FLUTTERING OF HER SKIRT AS IT BRUSHED AGAINST THE PILLARS ROUSED HIM FROM A SPECIES OF TRANCE OR REVERIE
HIS FRIEND WATCHED HIM WITH VERY MUCH THE SAME MALICIOUS GRIN THAT HAD DISTORTED HIS FACE UNDER THE LAMP-LIT PORCH AT MAUDESLEY
YOU'LL SPILL YOUR WINE SAID MAJOR VERNON
I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE PAST
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR ME IF I HAD LET MARGARET WILMOT GO HER OWN WAY AND CARRY OUT HER SUBLIME SCHEME OF SELF-SACRIFICE
SHE SAT WITH HER ELBOW RESTING ON THE CUSHIONED ARM OF THE CHAIR AND HER HEAD SUPPORTED BY HER HAND
FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF HIS TIME HE WROTE NOW AND THEN COMPLAINING BITTERLY OF HIS FATE
BUT I'VE HEARD THE STORY HINTED AT AMONGST THE CLERKS IN THE DAYS WHEN I WAS ONLY A CLERK MYSELF I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU EVER HEARD THE RIGHTS OF IT SIR SAMPSON WILMOT ANSWERED FUMBLING NERVOUSLY WITH AN OLD HORN SNUFF-BOX AND A RED COTTON HANDKERCHIEF AND I DOUBT IF ANY ONE KNOWS THE RIGHTS OF THAT STORY EXCEPT ME AND I CAN REMEMBER IT AS WELL AS IF IT ALL HAPPENED YESTERDAY--AY THAT I CAN--BETTER THAN I REMEMBER MANY THINGS THAT REALLY DID HAPPEN YESTERDAY LET'S HEAR THE STORY FROM YOU THEN SAMPSON MR BALDERBY SAID
YES WE WANT TO SEE THE PICTURE IF POSSIBLE SHE SAID
HAVE PITY UPON ME THE GIRL SAID IN A HOARSE UNNATURAL VOICE
GOOD MORNING AFTER THIS CLEMENT AUSTIN TOLD MARGARET THAT HE COULD BE OF NO USE TO HER
HENRY DUNBAR GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF
RESPECTABLE BLACK AND A CLEAN SHAVE YOU KNOW SAWNEY
OR TO RIDE OUT UPON THE POWERFUL HORSE HE HAD CHOSEN FROM THE STUD PURCHASED BY PERCIVAL DUNBAR
MR CARTER GAVE A LONG WHISTLE
NOW AND THEN SHE HAS SPOKEN OF HER FATHER
NO CHANGE I SUPPOSE HE SAID
AND YET THERE'S HIS LAMENESS--THAT'LL GO AGAINST HIM AT THE ROSE AND CROWN MR CARTER WAS INFORMED THAT A FLY HAD BEEN ORDERED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT MORNING BY A YOUNG PERSON FROM WOODBINE COTTAGE
NO I WON'T TAKE YOU TO PARIS WITH ME
THERE WAS AN EXAMINATION ABOUT A WEEK AGO WHICH WAS ADJOURNED UNTIL TO-DAY
CLEMENT AUSTIN INSTALLED MARGARET AND THE WIDOW IN A SITTING-ROOM WHICH WOULD HAVE COMFORTABLY ACCOMMODATED ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE
FOR HE HAD A POWERFUL ALLY IN HIS MOTHER WHO ADORED HER SON AND WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO BRING HOME A YOUNG NEGRESS OR A NORTH AMERICAN SQUAW TO THE MATERNAL HEARTH IF SUCH A BRIDE HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO HIS HAPPINESS
THEY WHEELED MR DUNBAR'S BED INTO HIS FAVOURITE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER AND LAID HIM THERE TO DRAG OUT LONG DREARY DAYS AND NIGHTS WAITING TILL HIS BROKEN BONES SHOULD UNITE AND HE SHOULD BE FREE TO GO WHITHER HE PLEASED
THERE IS CONTAMINATION IN ME
IT'LL WORK OUT VERY NEATLY UNLESS I'M ALTOGETHER WRONG
BUT I AM NO FITTING WIFE FOR YOU YOU ARE A NOBLE TRUE-HEARTED WOMAN MARGARET
THE BUSINESS CREATED A CONSIDERABLE SENSATION AND LORD HERRISTON HIMSELF WENT DOWN TO WINCHESTER TO WITNESS THE EXHUMATION OF THE REMAINS OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN BURIED UNDER THE NAME OF JOSEPH WILMOT
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CLARENDON HOTEL
GIVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BOLT AND I'M SATISFIED I TELL YOU I HAVE NO SUCH IDEA IN MY MIND MR DUNBAR ANSWERED WITH INCREASING IMPATIENCE
THAT WHICH TO THE IMPULSIVE GIRL SEEMED PROOF POSITIVE OF HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT WAS VERY LITTLE WHEN WRITTEN DOWN IN A BUSINESS-LIKE MANNER BY SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE'S CLERK
THE MAJOR LISTENED TO EVERY SYLLABLE AND ONLY EDGED-IN A WORD OR TWO NOW AND THEN WHEN THE CONVERSATION FLAGGED OR WHEN THERE WAS A CHANCE OF THE SUBJECT BEING CHANGED
SHE WILL HAVE ALL MY MONEY WHEN I DIE
THE BRIDE THAT THE RAIN RAINS ON
IT'LL BE MY BUSINESS TO SORT EM AND PUT EM SHIP-SHAPE AFTERWARDS
WHY SHOULD JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER BE SO ANXIOUS TO SCREEN HENRY DUNBAR NOW THAT SHE HAS SEEN HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE MURDER
THERE WERE MANY REASONS WHY CLEMENT AUSTIN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE BANKING-HOUSE
WE WANT THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH I KNOW SIR
CALL YOUR MASTER THE YOUTH RETIRED TO OBEY
HE WAS A PROUD MAN AND HE WAS NOT A SOCIABLE MAN
MR CARTER PAID THE MAN AND DISMISSED THE VEHICLE AND WENT ALONE INTO THE LITTLE GARDEN
LITTLE BY LITTLE I WON MY POOR FATHER AWAY FROM SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE
YOU MAY BRING UP SOME FRESH COFFEE JOHN
MR DUNBAR IS HERE
GO TO HER DEAR MOTHER AND TRY AND QUIET HER EXCITEMENT WHILE I GO FOR A MEDICAL MAN YOU THINK SHE IS ILL THEN CLEMENT I DON'T KNOW THAT MOTHER
LAURA DUNBAR WAS A PAMPERED CHILD OF FORTUNE
THE DETECTIVE HAD STARTED FROM SCOTLAND YARD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WITH AN OPEN WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF THE SUPPOSED MURDERER
MR GROGSON THE SHORNCLIFFE AUCTIONEER WILL SELL AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK PRECISELY THE FURNITURE AND LEASE OF THE SNUGGEST LITTLE BOX IN THESE PARTS--WOODBINE COTTAGE IT'S CALLED--A SWEET PRETTY LITTLE PLACE AS WAS THE PROPERTY OF OLD ADMIRAL MANDERS
HE LOST SIGHT OF MR KERSTALL AND COULD NEVER OBTAIN ANY TIDINGS OF THE PICTURE
IT'S BREAKING UP ABOVE THE ELMS YONDER MISS LAURA ELIZABETH SAID
BUT I SHOULD THINK ADDED THE LANDLORD GRAVELY LOOKING RATHER DOUBTFULLY AT HIS GUEST AS HE SPOKE I SHOULD THINK THE LEASE AND FURNITURE PICTURES AND PLATE WILL FETCH A MATTER OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND POUND
NO YOU ARE VERY BOLD PERHAPS I AM
FROM THAT HOUR HE HAUNTED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY
I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE WINCHESTER WITHOUT HAVING SEEN IT
THE BANKER STOPPED SUDDENLY AND WENT BACK TO THE PARLOUR
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF THIS WHISPERED AND HINTED AT OFTEN ENOUGH BEFORE TO-DAY
THE ENTRANCE-HALL OF THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPARTMENTS SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY FOLDING-DOORS THE UPPER PANELS OF WHICH WERE OF GROUND GLASS
ADMIRING THE SPLENDID SHRINES THE SANCTIFIED RELICS OF THE PAST WITH THE DELIGHT OF A SCHOLAR AND AN ANTIQUARIAN
SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE DETECTIVE AND BRUSHED HER HANDKERCHIEF HASTILY ACROSS THOSE TEARFUL EYES
HE HAD MEANT TO DO THIS AND BY-AND-BY WHEN HE HAD BEEN LOST SIGHT OF BY THE WORLD TO HIDE HIMSELF UNDER A NEW NAME AND A NEW NATIONALITY SO THAT IF EVER BY SOME STRANGE FATALITY BY SOME AWFUL INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE THE SECRET OF HENRY DUNBAR'S DEATH SHOULD COME TO LIGHT THE MURDERER WOULD BE AS ENTIRELY REMOVED FROM HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AS IF THE GRAVE HAD CLOSED OVER HIM AND HIDDEN HIM FOR EVER
I CALLED AT THE BANK YESTERDAY CASHED MY CHEQUES ASCERTAINED YOUR ADDRESS
YOUR FATHER HAS GIVEN ME FULL AUTHORITY TO ACT IN THIS BUSINESS MR HUGH DUNBAR SAID
BUT I MIGHT FURNISH HIM WITH THE TEXT FOR AN ELABORATE DISQUISITION ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF ENGLISH LOVERS
I THINK THIS MAN'S POSITION HAS SERVED HIM AS A SHIELD FROM THE VERY FIRST
THEN VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY HE BEGAN TO DROP THE DIAMONDS INTO THE OPEN END OF THE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT
AIN'T YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE YES DEAR BOY ANSWERED THE MAJOR PERFECTLY SATISFIED MORE THAN SATISFIED--FOR THE PRESENT
THE UNBIDDEN GUEST WHO CAME TO LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING
THERE IS A PORTMANTEAU IN MY CABIN AND MY TRAVELLING-DESK
I AM A RICH MAN BUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW RICH I AM AND I WANT TO REALIZE RATHER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY MR BALDERBY BOWED BUT HIS EYEBROWS WENT UP A LITTLE AS IF HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL SOME SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF HIS SURPRISE
HER LIFE HAD BEEN A VERY HARD ONE DARKENED BY THE EVER-BROODING SHADOW OF DISGRACE
THE JUNIOR PARTNER MR BALDERBY A GOOD-TEMPERED MIDDLE-AGED MAN WITH A LARGE FAMILY OF DAUGHTERS AND A HANDSOME RED-BRICK MANSION ON CLAPHAM COMMON HAD NEVER POSSESSED MORE THAN A FOURTH SHARE IN THE BUSINESS
I CAN FIND OUT AT THE ROSE AND CROWN WHETHER ANYBODY DID GO AWAY IN A FLY THE DETECTIVE THOUGHT
HE HAD NO SERVANT WITH HIM AND HIS LUGGAGE CONSISTED ONLY OF A PORTMANTEAU A DRESSING-CASE AND A DESPATCH-BOX
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A VERY LONELY PART OF THE PARK WHERE THERE WERE NO OTHER WITNESSES THAN THE TIMID DEER LURKING HERE AND THERE UNDER THE POOR SHELTER OF A CLUMP OF LEAFLESS ELMS,--IT WAS NOT TILL MAJOR VERNON FELT HIMSELF QUITE ALONE THAT HE GAVE WAY TO THE FULL EXUBERANCE OF HIS SPIRITS
BUT BY-AND-BY WHEN ONE OF THE CLERGYMEN ASKED THE FAMILIAR QUESTION--"_WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO THIS MAN HENRY DUNBAR CAME FORWARD INTO THE LIGHT OF THE WAX-CANDLES AND GAVE THE APPOINTED ANSWER
YES YOU MAY GO NOW--_YOU WHO ONCE WERE THE WOMAN I LOVED
HE SCATTERED THIS ABOUT WITH HIS FOOT DROPPED THE EMPTY MOROCCO CASE INTO HIS POCKET AND WENT UP-STAIRS IN THE MORNING SUNLIGHT
BUT HE DREW A LONG BREATH AND HELD HIS HEAD PROUDLY ERECT AS HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOORS AND WENT IN
TWO LITTLE FEET CARELESSLY THRUST INTO BLUE MOROCCO SLIPPERS PEEPED OUT FROM AMONGST THE FOLDS OF MISS DUNBAR'S DRESSING-GOWN AND ONE COQUETTISH SCARLET HEEL TAPPED IMPATIENTLY UPON THE FLOOR AS THE YOUNG LADY WATCHED THAT PROVOKING RAIN
IN MY PROFESSION A MAN LEARNS THE USE OF HIS EYES
THERE WAS NO LIVING CREATURE EXCEPT MYSELF IN THE CHURCHYARD AS I CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW OF THE TREES ON TO THE FLAT WHERE THE GRASS GREW LONG AMONG THE UNPRETENDING HEADSTONES
IT ANNOYS YOU DEAR FRIEND EH
IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL YOU CAN STAY
LOVE IS NOT METE OUT IN STRICT PROPORTION TO THE MERITS OF THOSE WE LOVE
THEY WOULDN'T COME IN HERE TILL THEY WERE DRESSED AND THEY'VE HAD THEIR HAIR SCREWED UP IN HAIR-PINS ALL NIGHT TO MAKE IT WAVE AND NOW IT'S A WET DAY THEIR HAIR WON'T WAVE AFTER ALL AND THEIR MAID'S GOING TO PINCH IT WITH THE FIRE-IRONS--THE TONGS I SUPPOSE MISS MACMAHON HAD BROWN HAIR WITH A NATURAL RIPPLE IN IT AND COULD AFFORD TO LAUGH AT BEAUTY THAT WAS OBLIGED TO ADORN ITSELF BY MEANS OF HAIR-PINS AND TONGS
VERY EARLY ON THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING THE MAJOR MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE CHURCHYARD
HE LOOKED A VAGABOND CERTAINLY--EVERY INCH A VAGABOND
AND CONSIDERIN THE DEAL OF CONFIDENCE YOU HONOURED ME WITH ABOUT THIS HERE COVE I DON'T SEE AS I COULD HAVE DONE HANYTHINK MORE THEN THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO KEEP WATCH HERE FOR THE STARTING OF THE UP-TRAINS WHILE I GO AND KEEP MY EYE UPON THE STATION AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER SAID MR CARTER THIS JOURNEY TO HULL MAY HAVE BEEN JUST A DODGE TO THROW US OFF THE SCENT AND OUR MAN MAY TRY AND DOUBLE UPON US BY GOING BACK TO LONDON
I'M UNEASY ABOUT HER ABSENCE TOO MOTHER HE SAID I'LL GO AND LOOK FOR HER HE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM BUT HIS MOTHER CALLED TO HIM
THERE WAS NOTHING STIRRING BUT A BANK-OF-ENGLAND FORGERY CASE
JAMES WENTWORTH JINGLED THE MONEY IN HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE RAILWAY STATION
HERE SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE THE MAGISTRATE SAT AT A TABLE WRITING
HE COULD SEE NO DESIGN IN ENGLAND THAT AT ALL SATISFIED HIM NO I DARE SAY NOT ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE I DARE SAY HE'D FIND IT RATHER DIFFICULT TO PLEASE HIMSELF IN THAT MATTER LAURA LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT MR CARTER
WE SHALL BE POORER I SUPPOSE CLEM MRS AUSTIN SAID
SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHAKING HANDS WITH MRS AUSTIN AND CLEMENT WHEN SHE LEFT THEM
MY FRIEND HERE DOESN'T DRINK PORT
BUT THAT MR KERSTALL SON WAS AT HIS SERVICE
PEOPLE WENT IN AND OUT AND LOITERED ABOUT THE PREMISES AND LOUNGED IN THE BAR DRINKING AND TALKING ALL THE MORNING AND THE THEME OF EVERY CONVERSATION WAS THE MURDER THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE GROVE ON THE WAY TO ST CROSS
MAY HEAVEN HAVE PITY UPON HER AND ME CHAPTER XXXIV
AS I RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE LIMP MOROCCO-COVERED VOLUME I ALMOST WONDER AT MY WASTED LABOUR;--THE RANDOM NOTES JOTTED DOWN NOW AND THEN SOMETIMES WITH LONG INTERVALS BETWEEN THEIR DATES MAKE SUCH A MASS OF WORTHLESS LITERATURE
ADDED BY CLEMENT AUSTIN SEVEN YEARS AFTERWARDS CHAPTER I
HE NEVER TOOK OFF HIS HAT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FELLOW-MEN
AND IF THE GIRL'S HEART GREW SICK IT WAS NOT WITH THE FEAR THAT HER FATHER WOULD NOT RETURN TO HER
YOU'LL FIND IT RARE AND COLD ON T WATER AFTER DARK MR CARTER ASSENTED TO THIS PROPOSITION AND HURRIED OFF TO BUY HIMSELF A RAILWAY RUG
THE TWO STALWART YOUNG FISHERMEN RAN ALONG THE QUAY AND ONE OF THEM DROPPED DOWN INTO A BOAT THAT WAS CHAINED TO AN ANGLE IN THE QUAY-SIDE WHERE THERE WAS A FLIGHT OF SLIMY STONE STEPS LEADING DOWN TO THE WATER
ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE'S SUCH A PLACE AS A SERVANTS ALL AND A SERVANTS HENTRANCE BUT THE LANGUID RETAINER WAS TOO LATE
THERE WERE BROKEN MEERSCHAUM-PIPES
I'VE TURNED IT OVER IN MY MIND EVERY WAY
THE RAIN WAS OVER AND THE MOON WAS SHINING IN A CLOUDLESS SKY
MR DUNBAR CAN'T POSSIBLY REFUSE TO SEE YOU I SHOULD THINK MISS THE WAITER WENT UP-STAIRS LOOKING BACK AT MARGARET AS HE WENT
IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE GIRL WHO HAD SO PERSISTENTLY FOLLOWED HIM WHO HAD ONLY LATELY SUCCEEDED IN SEEING HIM
I HAVE SUFFERED QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY ON ACCOUNT OF THIS MAN'S DEATH HE SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND TOOK UP HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING
THERE WAS NO RAIN NOW
SPEAK TO ME MY DARLING
VERY WELL THEN
LORD HERRISTON WAS AN ACTIVE OLD FELLOW
BUT HE LEFT A MESSAGE FOR YOU IN CASE YOU WAS TO COME
MR CARTER MADE A FURTIVE INSPECTION OF EVERY CREATURE WHO WENT BY THE UP-TRAIN AND SAW THAT CONVEYANCE SAFELY OFF BEFORE HE TURNED TO LEAVE THE STATION
BUT WHERE'S MARGARET MRS AUSTIN STARED AGHAST AT HER SON'S QUESTION
SO THAT IT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE TO PICK OUT THE SPOT
YES I AM MR DUNBAR I HAVE BEEN SENT FROM THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE SIR RETURNED JOSEPH
HIS FACE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN BEHIND THE NEWSPAPER
THEY CARRIED HIM TO THE FORESTERS ARMS SIR AS THAT WAS THE NEAREST PLACE TO WHERE THEY FOUND HIM
WHAT WAS IT TO ME THAT MY BREAST SHOULD BE ALL OF A SUDDEN FILLED WITH A TUMULT OF GLAD EMOTIONS AND THUS SHRINK FROM ANY ENCOUNTER WITH MY MOTHER'S HONEST EYES
BEYOND THE GATE THERE WAS A PATHWAY WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE TRUNKS OF THE GREAT ELMS ACROSS THE DRY GRASS
DON'T SIT MEDITATING THERE AS IF YOU WERE A GREAT SPECULATOR BROODING OVER THE STAGNATION OF THE MONEY-MARKET
I AM SURE THAT I SHALL RECOGNIZE MY FATHER'S PORTRAIT IF BY ANY CHANCE IT SHOULD BE AMONGST THEM WE WILL SET TO WORK AT ONCE THEN THE ARTIST SAID BRISKLY
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT HE IS I'M AFRAID IT IS SO SIR
IT WAS NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK BY THE TIME HE HAD DONE THIS
DO YOU MEAN BY COMING ALONGSIDE US HE CRIED
I THINK SAWNEY KNOWS ME TOO WELL FOR THAT HE SAID
I HAVE NO GREAT LOVE FOR MR HENRY DUNBAR FOR I CAN NEVER CEASE TO LOOK UPON HIM AS THE CAUSE OF MY POOR BROTHER JOSEPH'S RUIN
THE BANKER PASSED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD WHICH HE HAD NOT CROSSED FOR FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS UNTIL TO-DAY
HE FORGOT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT SMILED ON HIM
YOU ARE GOING BY THE HALF-PAST NINE O'CLOCK TRAIN YOU SAY MISS WILMOT CLEMENT HAD ONLY SPOKEN THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS A PROUD MAN
NOT ONE OF THESE HAD SEEN JOSEPH WILMOT NOR HAD THERE BEEN HEARD ANY CRY OF ANGUISH OR WILD SHRIEKS OF TERROR
I SHALL GO BACK TO THE GEORGE
I AM A PROUD MAN I WILL NOT SUE IN FORMA PAUPERIS
IT'S TRYING TO LEAVE ENGLAND THAT BRINGS MOST OF EM TO GRIEF AND JOSEPH WILMOT'S AN OLD ENOUGH HAND TO KNOW THAT
THE FEATURES WERE DELICATE AND STATUESQUE IN THEIR FORM
BUT TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE SAW A STRANGE VESSEL WHERE HE EXPECTED TO SEE THE CROW AND IN ANSWER TO HIS EAGER INQUIRIES AMONGST THE IDLERS ON THE QUAY AND THE OTHER IDLERS ON THE BOATS HE WAS TOLD THAT THE CROW HAD WEIGHED ANCHOR HALF AN HOUR AGO AND WAS OVER YONDER
IT WAS A STREET IN WHICH YOU MET DIRTY PORTERS CARRYING SIX FEET OF HIGHLY-BAKED BREAD AND SHRILL OLD WOMEN WITH WONDERFUL BANDANAS BOUND ABOUT THEIR GRISLY HEADS
BAD THOUGHTS COME FAST ENOUGH AT ANY TIME
NO NO YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT EVEN TO A LOATHSOME WRETCH LIKE ME BUT YOU WILL GO AWAY--YOU WILL ESCAPE FROM THEM WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID OF THEM
AND IN THE DUSKY STILLNESS OF THE EVENING WITH THE FAINT ODOUR OF DEWY FLOWERS ROUND ME AND DISTANT STARS SHINING DIMLY IN THAT FAR-OFF OPAL SKY
FORGIVE INDEED
AND MY MOTHER WAS ABOUT THE LAST OF WOMANKIND TO BE WANTING IN TENDERNESS AND COMPASSION FOR ANY ONE WHO HAD NEED OF HER PITY AND WAS WORTHY OF HER LOVE
I SUPPOSE YOU'D BE QUITE CONTENTED IF I WERE TO BUY YOU A SMALL ANNUITY THAT WOULD KEEP YOU STRAIGHT WITH THE WORLD FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
I DO NOT YOU DO NOT
I KNOW THAT RUSTY SCRAPS OF WORN-OUT HARDWARE DEAD BODIES OF CATS AND DOGS OLD SHOES LADEN WITH PEBBLES RANK ENTANGLEMENTS OF VEGETABLE CORRUPTION AND ALL MANNER OF LIKELY AND UNLIKELY RUBBISH WERE DRAGGED OUT OF THE STREAM AND THROWN ASIDE UPON THE BANK
AND ELEGANT MODERN FURNITURE CONTRASTED PLEASANTLY WITH THE ELIZABETHAN CASEMENTS AND CARVED OAKEN CHIMNEY-PIECES
CAN WE PRAY THAT THOSE MEMORIES MAY BE KEPT GREEN
THAT'S ALL SQUARE AND PLEASANT HE ANSWERED
THE FIRST STAGE ON THE JOURNEY HOME IX
I DON'T KNOW WHAT STEPS OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE
NO SOONER HAD THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR CLOSED UPON THE CASHIER THAN HENRY DUNBAR TURNED ABRUPTLY TO HIS JUNIOR PARTNER
HE DRANK A CUP OF TEA BATHED HIS HEAD WITH COLD WATER AND THEN SAT DOWN AT A WRITING-TABLE NEAR THE FIRE
LAURA RUSHED TO FETCH WATER AND AROMATIC VINEGAR FROM HER DRESSING-ROOM
THIS LOVE WHOSE GRADUAL BIRTH WE RARELY WATCH OR RECOGNIZE--THIS LOVE THAT STEALS ON US LIKE THE CALM DAWNING OF THE EASTERN LIGHT STRIKES TO A DEEPER ROOT AND GROWS INTO A GRANDER TREE THAN THAT FAIR SUDDEN GROWTH THAT MARVELLOUS FAR-SHOOTING BUTTERFLY-BLOSSOMING ORCHID CALLED LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IT WAS FROM HENRY MADDISON DUNBAR TO WILLIAM BALDERBY AND IT CONSISTED OF THESE WORDS PRAY COME TO ME DIRECTLY AT THE GEORGE WINCHESTER
MR CARTER PERCEIVED MY EMBARRASSMENT AND WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE ME
I WANT THIS BEARD OF MINE TRIMMED AND ALTERED
HE WAS HEART-WHOLE
THE TIME'S GETTING ON
WERE I A PAINTER I SHOULD BE LIKE CLAUDE MELNOTTE AND PAINT NO FACE BUT HERS
HE IS NEVER ALONE
I DARE SAY YOU WONDER WHY I AM SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS BUSINESS WELL TO TELL THE HONEST TRUTH SIR IT DOES SEEM RATHER OUT OF THE COMMON TO SEE AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU TAKING ALL THIS TROUBLE TO FIND OUT THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF A MURDER COMMITTED GOING ON FOR A TWELVEMONTH AGO
NOT SO MUCH EVEN AS TO WONDER WHETHER THE STROKE HAD BEEN FATAL,--WHETHER THE OLD MAN WAS YET DEAD
I KNEW NOW THAT IT WAS THE FIGURE OF THE NOBLE-HEARTED WOMAN I LOVED--THE FIGURE OF THE HEROIC DAUGHTER WHO HAD FOLLOWED ME TO WINCHESTER AND DOGGED MY FOOTSTEPS IN THE VAIN EFFORT TO STAND BETWEEN HER FATHER AND THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME
SINKING THE PAST
HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT OUT MR CARTER ASKED LOOKING WE FULL IN THE FACE
AND WHEN I WENT HOME FROM THE CITY UPON THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON MY MIND WAS FAR LESS OCCUPIED WITH THE BUSINESS EVENTS OF THE DAY THAN WITH ABSTRUSE SPECULATIONS AT TO THE PROBABILITIES WITH REGARD TO THAT YOUNG LADY'S SKILL UPON THE PIANO-FORTE
HE SAT DOWN I SUPPOSE YES
HE DID NOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE FACILITIES OFFERED BY THAT WONDERFUL ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHICH WAS ONCE FACETIOUSLY CALLED THE ROPE THAT HUNG TAWELL THE QUAKER BECAUSE IN SO DOING HE MUST HAVE TAKEN THE LOCAL POLICE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE AND HE WISHED TO DO HIS WORK QUIETLY ONLY AIDED BY A COMPANION AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER WHOM HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING
AND HOW WAS IT THAT I DID NOT THINK THE WORLD BLANK AND EMPTY
HE TOLD ALL THIS WITH MANY ENCOMIUMS UPON THE RICH MAN'S PLEASANT MANNER
GO MARGARET WILMOT
SO HE SAID YES
THE COLD-HEARTED SCOUNDREL WHO HAD SO CRUELLY BETRAYED HIM
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY HUNGRY FOR I TOOK A VERY SUBSTANTIAL LUNCHEON AT SOUTHAMPTON
THEY HAD A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN THEM THOSE EYES--A SORT OF HUNGRY EAGER LOOK AS IF THE VERY SIGHT OF HIS OLD FOE WAS A KIND OF FOOD THAT WENT SOME WAY TOWARDS SATISFYING THIS MAN'S VENGEFUL FURY
MR DUNBAR HE SAID
AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY HE ORDERED A BROUGHAM AND WAS DRIVEN TO THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
AND IN ALL THE WORLD THERE IS ONLY ONE FAVOUR YOU CAN GRANT ME
WHAT IS THE PENALTY HE MAY SUFFER HERE COMPARED TO THAT THOU CANST INFLICT HEREAFTER
HIS NOSE WAS SMALL HIS EYES LARGE HIS EARS AND NECK LONG
FOR HIS OWN PART ARTHUR LOVELL WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET BACK TO LONDON
WHAT HAD WE FOR DINNER THAT DAY
FLIGHT
BUT IT ALL AMOUNTED TO NOTHING
BUT WHY SHOULD I ASK YOU QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD NOT ANSWER WITHOUT PAIN
I MUST HAVE LEFT THE WRAPPER ON THE TABLE ON THE NIGHT WHEN I RECEIVED THE BOX AND ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAD NO DOUBT PUT IT INTO THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET
THE MURDER OF JOSEPH WILMOT HAD FORMED THE SUBJECT OF MANY A LONG DISCUSSION AMONGST THE TOWNS-PEOPLE AT SHORNCLIFFE AND THE FAMILIAR NAME STRUCK THE SURGEON'S EAR
BUT THAT ATTEMPT WAS A MOST DISMAL FAILURE
WE DID SEE SOMETHING ABOUT THE MURDER IN THE PAPERS BUT DIDN'T TAKE ANY INTEREST IN IT
I WANT TO LOOK IN HIS FACE AND SEE IF HIS EYES CAN MEET MINE YOU SHALL SEE HIM THEN DEAR GIRL
HE COULD FEEL HOW COLD IT WAS EVEN THROUGH HER GLOVE
THEY WOULD STAND BY HIM TO THE DEATH
THE POODLE COLLAR WAS GONE
BUT HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THAT ALMOST BLINDING GLARE
THERE'S NO SUCH WEDDIN'S AS THAT NOWADAYS SIR SAID THE OLD BEADLE WITH A GROAN
THE CROW HAD GOT TOO MUCH OF A START THEY SAID CONSIDERING THAT THE WIND WAS IN HER FAVOUR
IF YOU REFUSE TO SEE THIS PERSON WHO AT ANY RATE CALLS HERSELF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER THEY MAY SAY THEY MAY SAY WHAT ASKED HENRY DUNBAR
THE MAN WHO KNOWING THIS SENT HIS VICTIM BEFORE AN OFFENDED GOD WITHOUT SO MUCH WARNING AS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME TO THINK ONE PRAYER
BUT MY BACKERS ARE POOR PEOPLE AND I CAN'T PUT THEM IN A HOLE
MARGARET LINGERED A LITTLE IN THE AVENUE WATCHING FOR A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH SHE MIGHT HAZARD THIS ATTEMPT
WHY NOT MARGARET I CANNOT TELL YOU THE REASON BUT YOU SHALL TELL ME MARGARET CRIED CLEMENT PASSIONATELY
I SHAN'T BE ABLE TO SEE LORD HERRISTON TO-NIGHT MR DUNBAR SAID HURRIEDLY
ONE OF THEM ORDERED DINNER FOR EIGHT O'CLOCK THE BEST DINNER THE HOUSE COULD PROVIDE
BUT YOU ARE SO DIVIDED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD BY YOUR FATHER'S WEALTH THAT I HAVE FEARED TO SPEAK
MR DUNBAR FOLLOWED THE SERVANT TO THE DINING-ROOM DOOR AND STOOD UPON THE THRESHOLD LISTENING
THE MAN WHO HAD HENRY DUNBAR OR THE SUPPOSED HENRY DUNBAR ARRESTED LAST AUGUST
A WEEK PASSED AND ANOTHER WEEK BEGAN AND STILL HE DID NOT COME
I MIGHT HAVE MADE A BIT OF CHARACTER OUT OF THAT
OR PERHAPS THE WINE I DRANK AT SOUTHAMPTON MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT HE ADDED WITH A LAUGH
THERE'S SCARCELY ENOUGH WIND TO PUFF OUT A FARTHING CANDLE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN SAID
SECRETS ALWAYS MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE NO MORE WAS SAID UPON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS ARRANGED BY-AND-BY THAT MRS AUSTIN AND MARGARET SHOULD PREPARE TO START FOR WARWICKSHIRE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHEN CLEMENT WOULD BE FREED FROM ALL ENGAGEMENTS TO MESSRS
HE WANTED TO TAKE HER AWAY TO THE SOUTHERN REGIONS WHERE HE HAD TRAVELLED SO GAILY IN HIS CARELESS BACHELOR DAYS WHERE HE WOULD BE SO SUPREMELY HAPPY NOW WITH HIS BRIGHT YOUNG BRIDE BY HIS SIDE
HE HELD IT UP OVER THE GRATE AND DRAINED THE OIL
HE WAS ABOUT TO TRUST HIMSELF AMONG SUCH FELLOWS AS THESE IN THE HOPE OF CAPTURING A CRIMINAL WHOSE CHANCES IF ONCE CAUGHT WERE SO DESPERATE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO HESITATE AT ANY MEASURES BY WHICH HE MIGHT AVOID A CAPTURE
IT WAS A STYLISH ESTABLISHMENT AND THERE WAS A LANGUID YOUNG MAN TAKING DOWN THE SHUTTERS WHO APPEARED TO BE THE ONLY PERSON ON THE ESTABLISHMENT JUST AT PRESENT
YOU WHO HAVE THROWN AWAY THE BEAUTIFUL MASK I BELIEVED IN AND REVEALED TO ME THE FACE OF A SKELETON
THE YOUNG PERSON WHO CALLS HERSELF JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER IS INFORMED THAT MR DUNBAR DECLINES TO SEE HER NOW OR AT ANY FUTURE TIME
IF MY WISHES COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY GUINEA HE POSSESSES WOULD BE A SEPARATE SCORPION TO STING AND TO TORTURE HIM HENRY DUNBAR WHISPERED MARGARET TO HERSELF--"HENRY DUNBAR
THE MILLIONAIRE TOUCHED THE BROAD PALM WITH THE TIPS OF HIS GLOVED FINGERS
THERE'S SOMETHING COMING HE CRIED
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T GUESS--I'VE SO MANY OLD FRIENDS
OH FATHER YOU DON'T KNOW--YOU DON'T KNOW
IT WAS VERY CIVIL OF MR BALDERBY TO SEND SOME ONE TO MEET ME--VERY CIVIL INDEED THE ANGLO-INDIAN'S HEAD SANK BACK UPON THE MOROCCO CUSHION OF THE EASY-CHAIR AND HE LOOKED LANGUIDLY AT HIS COMPANION WITH HALF-CLOSED EYES
DO YOU FORGET WHO I AM AND THE TAINT THAT IS IN MY BLOOD
YOU'LL FIND EM GENTLEMANLY HE SAID
AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD DISAPPEAR SOMETIMES FOR A FEW DAYS SOMETIMES FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AT A TIME
A MAN CAME DOWN EXPRESS FROM HOWELL AND JAMES'S TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY WITH A BUNDLE OF PATTERNS
AT HALF-PAST THREE HE WAS IN LONDON
IT SEEMS A HORRIBLE THING PERHAPS FOR A WOMAN TO WISH DETECTION TO OVERTAKE ANY MAN HOWEVER BASE
HE CANNOT DOUBT THE WOMAN HE ADORES
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'D GO AND CUT UP SMOOTH ABOUT IT ANSWERED THE INDIGNANT TIBBLES
I AM GOING TO INDIA LAURA
NEVER YOU MIND THE RAIN MISS LAURA BUT IT'S A BAD OMEN ISN'T IT ELIZABETH ASKED LAURA DUNBAR
MY MOTHER HAS BEEN ALMOST AS MUCH ALARMED AS I HAVE BEEN
IN THE WAITING-ROOM THERE WAS A COKE FIRE VERY RED AND HOLLOW AND A DIM LAMP
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT AUDACIOUS
HE'S THE MAN WHO GAVE HIS EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST
SHE KNEW THAT THE MAN SHE SOUGHT AND HAD SO LONG SOUGHT WITHOUT AVAIL WAS IN THAT ROOM
I'M A COMMERCIAL MAN AND I WANT EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF DIAMONDS THAT SHALL BE WORTH THE MONEY I GIVE FOR THEM TO BREAK UP AND SELL AGAIN
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO BE SURPRISED THAT I SHRINK FROM SEEING MARGARET WILMOT HE SAID
I HAVE NO RIGHT TO FOLLOW HER AGAINST HER OWN WISH HE SAID TO HIMSELF
I LOVE YOU LAURA
MOTHERS WITH ONLY SONS ARE NOT VERY STRONG-MINDED
THE COMFORTABLE ELEGANCE OF MRS AUSTIN'S DRAWING-ROOM THE PEACEFUL QUIET OF THE SABBATH-EVENING WHEN THE CURTAINS WERE DRAWN BEFORE THE BAY-WINDOW AND THE SHADED LAMP BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM
AND THIS MORNING THE HORSE WAS GONE AND THE GRAVEL ALL TRAMPLED UP AND MR DUNBAR'S GOLD-HEADED CANE WHICH THE POOR GENTLEMAN WAS STILL SO LAME IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO WALK FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER WAS LYING BY THE GARDEN-GATE
AND PRESENTLY HE GETS UP HOBBLIN WORSE THAN EVER AND GOES OUTSIDE AND I HEARS HIM MAKIN INQUIRIES ABOUT THE BEST WAY OF GETTIN ON TO EDINBOROUGH BY TRAIN
NODDING IN THE EASY-CHAIR BY THE HEARTH
FATHER YOU WILL NEVER COMPEL ME TO DO THIS PERCIVAL DUNBAR HAD NEVER LOOKED AT HIS SON SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD ENTERED THE ROOM
AND I FLUNG MYSELF BACK IN MY CHAIR WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
I FANCY I COULD VENTURE TO MAKE A PRETTY CORRECT GUESS AT A CERTAIN SECRET OF YOURS MY DEAR LOVELL
AND THIS WAS ALL THAT CAME OF LAURA JOCELYN'S SEARCH FOR HER FATHER'S PORTRAIT
WHICH OF THEM WAS TALKING AS THEY PASSED YOU ASKED THE CORONER
SHE WAS ALMOST AS HELPLESS AS HER SIX-WEEKS OLD BABY
SHE WAS STILL WITHOUT A GOVERNESS
BUT THE LIKENESS WAS A VERY FAINT ONE AND IT WAS FROM HER MOTHER THAT THE GIRL HAD INHERITED HER BEAUTY
PEOPLE IN CALCUTTA WHO COURTED AND ADMIRED THE RICH BANKER HAD BEEN WONT TO PRAISE THE ARISTOCRATIC EASE OF HIS MANNER WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN DISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR DEMONSTRATION OF HIS OWN EMOTIONS AND VERY RARELY RUFFLED BY ANY SYMPATHY WITH THE JOYS OR PITY FOR THE SORROWS OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES
DIDN'T I SEE THE COLOUR FADE OUT OF HER FACE TILL SHE WAS WHITER THAN THE LINEN COLLAR ROUND HER NECK AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT HER ARMS WERE ABOUT ME AND HER HONEST EYES LOOKING UP IN MY FACE AS SHE CRIED I SHALL NEVER LOVE YOU LESS DEAR
HE KNELT DOWN NOW BY THE EDGE OF THE PIER AND TIED ALL THESE STONES TOGETHER IN AN OLD COTTON POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF
HE FELL INTO THE OLD WAY AND TREATED HIS COMPANION WITH THAT HAUGHTY AFFABILITY WHICH A MONARCH MAY BE SUPPOSED TO EXHIBIT TOWARDS HIS PRIME FAVOURITE
MR CARTER SHOOK OFF THE DROWSY INFLUENCE OF HIS LONG SLEEP AND SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET
BUT NOWADAYS GIRLS OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIT DOWN AND DASH AWAY AT THE KEYS LIKE A PROFESSOR
HOW DARED THIS SHABBY-LOOKING MAN WITH CLUMSY BOOTS THAT WERE QUEER ABOUT THE HEELS AND A MANGY FUR COLLAR LIKE THE SKIN OF AN INVALID FRENCH POODLE TO HIS THREADBARE COAT--HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS AUDACIOUS DARED SUCH A LOW PERSON AS THIS LAY HIS DIRTY FINGERS UPON THE SACRED SHOULDER OF HENRY DUNBAR OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY'S BANKING-HOUSE ST GUNDOLPH LANE CITY
I REMEMBER HE ADDED PRESENTLY
AT NINE O'CLOCK MR DUNBAR LEFT THE ROOM TO SEE TO THE PACKING OF HIS THINGS AT A LITTLE BEFORE TEN THE THREE GENTLEMEN DROVE AWAY FROM THE GEORGE HOTEL ON THEIR WAY TO THE STATION
I'VE DREAMT OF THE RACE EVER SO MANY TIMES PHILIP
I SHALL TELL MY MOTHER NOTHING OF WHAT HAS PASSED BETWEEN US THIS DAY EXCEPT THAT WE HAVE PARTED
HE WAS GETTING TIRED BY THIS TIME BUT HE WAS NOT TIRED OF HIS WORK
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF THE PICTURES OH YES IF YOU DO NOT MIND ALL THIS TROUBLE MR KERSTALL BROUGHT DOWN ANOTHER HEAP OF UNFRAMED CANVASES FROM SHELF NUMBER TWO
THE ARCH MAGICIAN WAVED HIS WAND AND ALL THE UNIVERSE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO FAIRYLAND
I SAW THEM AT NIGHT
SHE FOUND IT AT LAST
GOOD NIGHT MAJOR VERNON STALKED AWAY THROUGH THE SNOW
AND WE CANNOT FEEL VERY LIGHT-HEARTED OR HAPPY UPON BLACK WINTRY DAYS WHEN THE LOWERING HEAVENS SEEM TO FROWN UPON OUR HOPES
YOU CAN FIND OUT IF SHE IS REALLY RELATED TO THAT UNHAPPY MAN
HE HAD HEARD THE STORY OF THE FORGERY HINTED AT BUT HE HAD NEVER HEARD ITS DETAILS
BUT HE IS THE SAME MAN HE WAS FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
THE MOTIVE'S WHAT YOU MUST LOOK TO IN THESE CASES SIR
AND WHAT CAN'T HE DO IN THAT TIME IF HE KEEPS HIS WITS ABOUT HIM AND DON'T GO WILD AND FOOLISH LIKE AS SOME OF EM DO WHEN THEY'VE GOT SUCH A CHANCE AS THIS
THE MEDICAL MAN DECLINED TO GIVE ANY POSITIVE STATEMENT ON THIS POINT
THEY SUITED EACH OTHER SO WELL
I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT MY GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY WHEN THE RACE IS OVER THE BELL RANG AND THE SEVEN STARTERS WENT OFF WITH A RUSH
A DANGEROUS MAN ALWAYS--A DANGEROUS MAN WHEN HE WAS LOUD RECKLESS BRUTAL VIOLENT
AND THEN MY MOTHER ASKED ME WHY IN THAT CASE DID I CONSIDER THE LADY SUITABLE,--WHICH QUESTION INCREASED MY EMBARRASSMENT BY TENFOLD
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSURD TO THWART THE MAN WHEN HE WAS WORKING IN MY INTERESTS
THESE EYES ARE UNVARYING IN THEIR COLOUR
I LIKE TO TAKE LIFE EASILY
HE ENTERED THE VILLAGE PUBLIC-HOUSE AT A LITTLE AFTER ONE AND HE STAYED THERE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY DRINKING BRANDY-AND-WATER--NOT IMMODERATELY
I AM GOING TO BED NOW
THE CLERK WHO GAVE JOSEPH WILMOT THIS INFORMATION ASKED HIM HOW HIS BROTHER WAS GETTING ON
LOVE AND DUTY FOUGHT FOR THE MASTERY OF HER PURE SOUL
I WANT TO SEE HOW THE SAME WORLD--SUCH A JUST AND MERCIFUL WORLD AS IT IS--HAS TREATED MY TEMPTER AND BETRAYER HENRY DUNBAR SAMPSON WILMOT TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF
SHE KISSED HER YOUNG MISS AND CRIED OVER HER A LITTLE BEFORE SHE WAS EQUAL TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF THE TOILETTE
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON MARGARET FOUND HER WAY TO A CEMETERY OUTSIDE THE TOWN WHERE UNDER A NEWLY-MADE MOUND OF TURF THE MURDERED MAN LAY
WE STROLLED A LITTLE FARTHER ON AND THEN TURNED AND WENT BACK TOWARDS THE CATHEDRAL
BUT HE TURNED ROUND WITH A GESTURE OF ANGRY IMPATIENCE AS JOSEPH WILMOT FINISHED SPEAKING
THE DETECTIVE GREW DIRTIER AND SLIMIER AND WETTER AS THE DAY WORE ON
I ONLY MET HIM THIS MORNING
IT MAY BE THAT THE SEAL OF OLD-BACHELORHOOD IS ALREADY SET UPON ME AND THAT I AM THAT ODIOUS AND HYPER-SENSITIVE CREATURE COMMONLY CALLED A FIDGET BUT SOMEHOW I COULD NOT FIND A GOVERNESS WHOM I REALLY FELT INCLINED TO CHOOSE FOR MY LITTLE LIZZIE
SINCE IT MUST BE SO HE SAID I WILL SEE THIS IMPORTUNATE WOMAN
MICHAEL KERSTALL WAS AN OLD MAN WHO LOOKED EVEN OLDER THAN HE WAS
THE KNOWING ONES DECLARED THIS MAN WORTHY TO RANK HIGH AMONGST THE BEST OF THEM
MARGARET WENT SOFTLY UP TO THIS CHAIR AND LAID HER HAND UPON THE OAKEN FRAMEWORK
WE SAT LATE IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF THE HERMITAGE
MR DAPHNEY REMOVED HIS PATIENT'S COAT AND WAISTCOAT
YOU'VE FELT A BELT ROUND YOUR MASTER'S WAIST WHEN YOU'VE BEEN LIFTING HIM IN AND OUT OF BED
I KNOW THAT I ALWAYS LIKED HIM HOW LONG WERE YOU IN THE GROVE WITH THE DECEASED NOT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES AND YOU CANNOT DESCRIBE THE SPOT WHERE YOU LEFT HIM NOT VERY EASILY
MR DAPHNEY THE RUGBY SURGEON TOLD HIS PATIENT ALL ABOUT THE ACCIDENT IN SUCH A BLAND PLEASANT WAY THAT ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THE COLLISION OF A COUPLE OF ENGINES RATHER AN AGREEABLE LITTLE EPISODE IN A MAN'S LIFE
SO SUDDENLY THAT HAD THE TWO YOUNG MEN IN THE BOAT BEEN ANYTHING BUT FIRST-RATE WATERMEN THEY AND MR CARTER WOULD HAVE BECOME VERY INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE BRINY ELEMENT AROUND AND ABOUT THEM
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BACK PARLOUR OF THE BANKING-HOUSE XXVII
NEVER OF COURSE
AND IT WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OF CERTAIN REMARKS DROPPED BY HIM THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN ARRESTED
THE MAN-SERVANT AS WAITED ON HIM FOUND THE ROOMS ALL EMPTY THE FIRST THING THIS MORNING
CALLED AT THE CLARENDON THIS MORNING WAS TOLD YOU'D THAT MINUTE GONE OUT
HER FATHER NEVER FORGAVE HER FOR THAT SECRET MARRIAGE
I DARE SAY THE CLERK OF THE WEATHER IS ONE OF THEM RAMPAGIN RADICALS THAT'S ALLUS A GOIN ON ABOUT THE BLOATED ARISTOCRACY AND HE'S DONE IT A PURPOSE TO AGGERAVATE YOU
FOR PITY'S SAKE LET ME IN THE MAN STANDING AT THE WINDOW KNEW THAT VOICE
AND THEN HE HEARD THE CRACKLING OF THE ENVELOPE AS THE GIRL TORE IT OPEN
WHY IT WAS A MR KERSTALL WHO PAINTED PAPA'S PORTRAIT
WILL YOU BRING PUNISHMENT UPON HIS MURDERER
SEND YOUR MESSENGER OFF AT ONCE THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW
PHILIP JOCELYN SAID THAT IN THAT CASE HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE MR KERSTALL JUNIOR
HE PLANTED HIS BRISTLY CHIN UPON HIS FOLDED ARMS AND CLOSED HIS EYES IN A KIND OF DOG-SLEEP
ARTHUR LOVELL PARTED WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL CLIENT AT THE RAILWAY STATION AND DROVE OFF TO THE HOTEL AT WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF STAYING
I SHALL LEAVE FULL DIRECTIONS FOR THE BURIAL OF THIS POOR FELLOW AND AN AMPLE SUM FOR HIS FUNERAL EXPENSES
HE WAS ENDEARED TO LAURA BY THE MEMORY OF A HAPPY CHILDHOOD
INDEED I NEVER DID HENRY DUNBAR MR HUGH SAID VERY SOLEMNLY NINE MEN OUT OF TEN WHO DO WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THINK WHAT YOU SAY YOU THOUGHT
THERE WAS A REVOLTING BRUTALITY IN THIS FACT
I'D A'MOST SOONER BE TRANSPORTED IF IT DON'T HURT MUCH DON'T HURT MUCH EXCLAIMED MR CARTER
THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK CHIMED THE HALF-HOUR AFTER NINE WHILE MR DUNBAR STOOD AT THE OPEN WINDOW LOOKING OUT INTO THE STREET
I CANNOT BE YOUR WIFE SO LONG AS THE SECRET OF THAT CRUEL DEED REMAINS UNKNOWN SHE SAID TO CLEMENT
A SINGLE LINE OF CARRIAGES EXTENDED FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OPPOSITE THE GRAND STAND
THAT'S CERTAIN THE CAPTAIN OF THE CROW SAID THIS WITH AN AIR OF SUBLIME RESIGNATION
IN AMONGST THE DIM BRANCHES OF THE TREES I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING MOVING SOMETHING THAT REMINDED ME OF THE FIGURE I HAD SEEN OPPOSITE THE POST-OFFICE ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
IT IS ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THEM THAT VARIES WITH EVERY EMOTION BUT IN REPOSE THEY HAVE A MOURNFUL EARNESTNESS IN THEIR LOOK A PENSIVE GRAVITY THAT SEEMS TO TELL OF A LIFE IN WHICH THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SHADOW
BUT SHE WAS VERY PALE NOW
THE JUNIOR PARTNER'S EYELIDS DROPPED UNDER THAT STOLEN GLANCE
THE OLD CLERK LOOKED VERY UNEASILY AT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER'S FACE
HE WAS EMINENTLY A MYSTERIOUS MAN AND SEEMED TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE CLOUD OF MYSTERY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM
IF THE BANKER'S MANNER WAS STERN AND MOODY TO-DAY THAT STERN MOODINESS WAS HABITUAL TO HIM
THE MISSES BALDERBY HAVE TAKEN WHAT THEY CALL A GREAT FANCY TO MY WIFE AND THEY SWARM OVER OUR DRAWING-ROOM CARPETS IN BLUE OR PINK FLOUNCES VERY OFTEN ON WHAT THEY CALL SOCIAL EVENINGS FOR A LITTLE MUSIC I FIND THAT A LITTLE MUSIC IS ONLY A SYNONYM WITH THE MISSES BALDERBY FOR A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE
SO THERE WAS NOBODY TO WAIT UPON HIM OR TO WATCH HIM WHEN HE WENT BACK TO THE TAPESTRIED ROOM
COME TO THAT YES THEY FOUND IT BY-AND-BY
I MUST FIND THE MISSING MAN YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER SAID LAURA WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
SIR PHILIP WHO WAS SITTING NEAR THE WINDOW LOOKING ON RATHER LISTLESSLY CRIED WHAT A HANDSOME FACE IT WAS A HANDSOME FACE--A BRIGHT YOUNG FACE WHICH SMILED HAUGHTY DEFIANCE AT THE WORLD--A SPLENDID FACE WITH PERHAPS A SHADE OF INSOLENCE IN THE CURVE OF THE UPPER LIP SHARPLY DENNED UNDER A THICK AUBURN MOUSTACHE WITH POINTED ENDS THAT CURLED FIERCELY UPWARDS
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING DEGRADING IN THE OFFICE THAT DEGRADATION HAD IN NO WAY AFFECTED HIM
AGAINST WHICH THE BRANCHES OF THE ELMS LOOKED SO BLACK AND DENSE I USED TO BEGUILE MYSELF--OR IT MAY BE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE SCENE AND HOUR BEGUILED ME--INTO THE THOUGHT THAT MY SEPARATION FROM MARGARET COULD BE ONLY A TEMPORARY ONE
ARTHUR LOVELL MR BALDERBY AND THE ANGLO-INDIAN SAT IN A LITTLE GROUP APART FROM THE REST
I HEARD YOUR HOUSE SPOKEN OF BY NO LESS A PERSON THAN MR DUNBAR THE GREAT BANKER THE WAITER PRICKED UP HIS EARS
SHE IS PASSIONATELY FOND OF MUSIC I KNOW
HE TOOK THE ROAD LEADING TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND WALKED AT A BRISK PACE HEEDLESS OF THE SNOW WHICH WAS STILL FALLING THICK AND FAST
THE THIRD STROKE OF PARALYSIS HAD COME UPON HIM
PERFECTLY FREE THEN I DON'T SO MUCH WONDER THAT HE WENT EXCLAIMED THE OCCUPANT OF THE COTTAGE STOOPING OVER THE FIRE AND KNOCKING THE ASHES OUT OF HIS MEERSCHAUM
REMEMBER SHE MAY NOT BE SO STRONG-MINDED AS YOU ARE NO NO GASPED MARGARET IN A CHOKING VOICE
AND IT'S YER BOUNDEN DOOTY MISS TO GO BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE DIRECTLY-MINUTE AND MAKE YER STATEMENT THE PORTER COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM SMACKING HIS LIPS WITH AN AIR OF RELISH AS HE SAID THIS
THE OLD CLERK HAD FALLEN FROM HIS SEAT AND LAY IN A MOTIONLESS HEAP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
MARGARET SUBMITTED TO TAKE THE SEDATIVE DRAUGHT SENT BY THE MEDICAL MAN
MARGARET'S ARM HUNG LOOSELY BY HER SIDE AS LIFELESS IN ITS ATTITUDE AS IF IT HAD BELONGED TO THE DEAD
CANNOT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MY NERVES MAY BE NONE OF THE STRONGEST AND THAT I CANNOT ENDURE THE IDEA OF AN INTERVIEW WITH THIS GIRL WHO NO DOUBT BY HER PERSISTENT PURSUIT OF ME SUSPECTS ME OF HER FATHER'S MURDER
SO THEN HE WENT TO JOSEPH IN AN AWFUL STATE OF MIND DECLARING THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY IN A MONTH OR SO FROM HIS FATHER AND THAT IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING JUST TO PRESERVE HIS CREDIT FOR THE TIME AND MEET THE CLAIMS OF THE VULGAR CITY BETTING FELLOWS WHO WERE PRESSING HIM HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE ALL SQUARE AFTERWARDS
THE POOR ABOUT JOCELYN'S ROCK IDOLIZED THE YOUNG LORD OF THE SOIL
WELL I CUTS OUT BY THE SAME DOOR THINKIN MY LAME FRIEND CAN'T BE VERY FAR
GO HOME AND SLEEP UPON THIS
I'M GOING DOWN TO THE CHIEF QUARTERS OF THE COUNTY CONSTABULARY HE SAID
SHE KNEW NO WEARINESS OF THE ROLLING HOURS TO HER THE WORLD SEEMED A PARADISE OF BEAUTY
AND I HAVE THE FEELINGS OF A MAN
THAT'S NUMBER ONE
HE SENT FOR ME TO HIS ROOM
IN THE DAY AND HOUR WHEN HE IS PROUDEST OF THE NEW NAME HE HAS MADE AND THE RESPECT HE HAS WON FOR HIMSELF SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCE ONCE A FRIEND BUT NOW AN ENEMY FALLS ACROSS HIS PATHWAY
HANGING ABOUT THIS WINDY STATION WHICH THE NUMBER OF CRISS-CROSS DRAUGHTS CUTTIN IN FROM OPEN DOORS AND WINDERS WOULD LEAD A HIGNORANT PERSON TO BELIEVE THERE WAS SEVENTEEN P'INTS OF THE COMPASS AT THE VERY LEAST--HANGIN ABOUT TO WATCH TRAIN AFTER TRAIN TILL THERE AIN'T ANYTHING GOIN IN THE WAY OF SARCE AS YEN HAVEN'T GOT TO STAND FROM THE PORTERS
LONG HOURS OF LONELINESS LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND THOUGHTS THAT FROM EVERY DIVERGING POINT FOR EVER NARROWED INWARDS TO ONE HIDEOUS CENTRE HAD DONE THEIR WORK OF HIM
SMIRKING SHEPHERDS SUPPORTED OPEN-WORK BASKETS LADEN WITH TINY ALGERIAN APPLES CHINA ORANGES AND BIG PURPLE HOTHOUSE GRAPES
BY THE LIGHT OF THIS LAMP CLEMENT AUSTIN SAW MARGARET WILMOT COMING TOWARDS HIM SLOWLY
AT THREE O'CLOCK THE INQUEST COMMENCED
ONCE MORE GOOD EVENING THE OLD CLERK BOWED AND LEFT THE ROOM
IF THIS IS A WILD-GOOSE CHASE I'VE BEEN IN WILDER THAN THIS BEFORE TO-DAY AND HAVE CAUGHT MY MAN THE LITTLE FISHING SMACK BEHAVED BRAVELY WHEN SHE GOT OUT TO SEA
IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT IN MAKING THESE EXPLANATIONS TO HIS HUMBLE FRIEND MR CARTER EMPLOYED A TONE THAT IMPLIED NO LITTLE SUPERIORITY AND THAT THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS MANNER WAS TEMPERED BY CONDESCENSION
THERE WAS MANY A DEEP BIT OF WATER BETWEEN WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL AND THE FERNS THE LANDLORD SAID
THE SIGHT OF PLEASANT HOMES MADE THE CASHIER THINK VERY MOURNFULLY OF THE GIRL HE HAD JUST LEFT
I WAS VERY COOL TO HER AT FIRST
IT WAS UPON THIS OCCASION THAT ARTHUR LOVELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE OBSERVED THAT DORA MACMAHON HAD VERY BEAUTIFUL BROWN EYES AND RIPPLING BROWN HAIR AND THE SWEETEST SMILE HE HAD EVER SEEN--EXCEPT IN ONE LOVELY FACE WHICH WAS LIKE THE SPLENDOUR OF THE NOONDAY SUN AND SEEMED TO EXTINGUISH ALL LESSER LIGHTS
NOW AT A STEEPLE-CHASE NOW AT A DINNER-PARTY WHERE LAURA APPEARED WITH SOME FRIENDLY CHAPERON
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER VIRGINAL CANDOUR HER BRIGHT YOUNG LOVELINESS THAT TOUCHED THE NOBLEST CHORDS OF HIS HEART
THE WORD VERY WAS UNDERSCORED
I THINK THAT FLAT AND DARKSOME LAND WHICH WE LOOK UPON OUT OF THE WINDOW OF A RAILWAY CARRIAGE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT MUST BE A WEIRD DISTRICT CONJURED INTO EXISTENCE BY THE POTENT MAGIC OF AN ENCHANTER'S WAND,--A DREARY DESERT TRANSPORTED OUT OF CENTRAL AFRICA TO MAKE THE NIGHT-SEASON HIDEOUS AND TO VANISH AT COCK-CROW
HE ALLUDED NOW AND THEN TO HIS INDIAN REMINISCENCES BUT DID NOT DWELL LONG UPON THIS SUBJECT
AND A GRAVE MAN-SERVANT IN A LINEN JACKET ADMITTED MARGARET INTO THE OAK-PANELLED HALL
ONLY ONCE HAD AFFLICTION COME NEAR HER
FRIGHTENED THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT HE FEARED
NOW YOU'D LIKE TO HELP ME IN THIS BUSINESS I DARE SAY MR AUSTIN
HE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WITH GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AND WITH RATHER A STERN EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE
YOU'VE BEEN THE TRUEST WOMAN THAT WAS EVER BORN UPON THIS EARTH TO MY THINKING
I MUST APPEAL TO MY MOTHER CLEMENT THOUGHT
AN IVORY CRUCIFIX WAS THE ONLY OBJECT UPON THE HIGH OLD-FASHIONED CHIMNEY-PIECE
BUT HE SAW NO MORE OF THE PLEASANT LANDSCAPE,--THE FAIR FIELDS OF WAVING CORN WITH SCARLET POPPIES AND DEEP-BLUE CORN FLOWERS BRIGHT GLIMPSES OF SUNLIT WATER AND DISTANT VILLAGES WITH GREY CHURCH-TURRETS NESTLING AMONG TREES
I NEVER HEARD WILMOT SPEAK OF ANY DAUGHTER
IT IS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NOTRE DAME MADAME IN THE RUE CAILOUX OVER THE OFFICE OF A PARISIAN JOURNAL HE SAID AS HE HANDED THE CARD TO LAURA
POOR GIRL IN HER IGNORANCE OF THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD SHE HAS NO IDEA OF THE DISTANCE SHE WILL HAVE TO WALK MR AUSTIN COULD NOT HELP FEELING VEXED BY MARGARET'S CONDUCT
THE CLERK TOOK A TICKET FOR HIS BROTHER AT THE FIRST STATION THE TRAIN STOPPED AT
IF THERE CAN BE EXPRESSION IN THE TAPPING OF A HAND AGAINST A PANE OF GLASS THERE WAS EXPRESSION IN THAT HAND--THE EXPRESSION OF ENTREATY RATHER THAN OF DEMAND AS IT SEEMED TO THAT WHITE AND TERROR-STRICKEN LISTENER
SHE SAYS HER NAME IS WILMOT--MARGARET WILMOT
MISS WENTWORTH HE SAID I KNOW THAT SOMETHING HAS AGITATED YOU
BY HUNGRY MEN WRESTLING FOR HIS CONVICTION AS A RESULT THAT WILL BRING THEM A GOLDEN REWARD
AND SILKS AND VELVETS GAUZES AND LACES AND ALMOST EVERY COSTLY FABRIC THAT WAS MADE WERE ORDERED FOR MISS DUNBAR'S EQUIPMENT
OUR FIRST PROCEEDING SIR MUST BE TO STRAIGHTEN THIS POOR LEG HE SAID SOOTHINGLY
A VENETIAN SENATOR BY TINTORETTO
SHE STARTED AT SEEING ME BUT DID NOT FAINT
ALL THE BRIGHTEST EVERGREENS IN THE LISFORD GARDENS HAD BEEN GATHERED AS A FITTING SACRIFICE FOR THE YOUNG LADY FROM THE ABBEY LAURA DUNBAR'S FRANK GOOD-NATURE AND RECKLESS GENEROSITY WERE WELL REMEMBERED UPON THIS OCCASION
ARTHUR LOVELL HAD BEEN THINKING OF LAURA AND LAURA'S FATHER THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY FROM LONDON
BUT THEN THAT TRIFLING WAYWARDNESS GAVE JUST THE SPICE THAT WAS WANTING TO THIS GRAND YOUNG LILY
AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT TRAVELLING BY A SLOW TRAIN
A KNIFE HAD BEEN CUNNINGLY INSERTED IN THE OUTER-WALL OF THE SPLENDID CAKE AND A FEW MORSELS OF THE RICH INTERIOR WHICH LOOKED LIKE A KIND OF PORTABLE DAY-AND-MARTIN HAD BEEN EATEN BY ONE OF THE BRIDESMAIDS
AN EASY PREY TO THE EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE
AS THE BOAT GAINED UPON THE VESSEL SHE WAS FOLLOWING MR CARTER TOLD THE TWO YOUNG MEN HIS ERRAND AND HIS AUTHORITY TO CAPTURE THE RUNAWAY
FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR--A POUND A WEEK YES I'LL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER MR DUNBAR
THE PROPRIETOR OF THE SHOP BOWED AND SMILED
I WENT HOME IN TRIUMPH TO MY MOTHER AND TOLD HER THAT I HAD SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN ENGAGING A LADY WHO WAS IN EVERY WAY SUITABLE AND THAT SHE WAS COMING THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO GIVE HER FIRST LESSON
I SHALL BUY THE DIAMONDS MYSELF DIRECT FROM THE MERCHANT-IMPORTERS
AND YET SOMEHOW OR OTHER I CAN'T GET ON WITH HIM NO
SHE DID NOT READ
SHALL I DESCRIBE HER FOR THE NEW ZEALANDER WHEN THE BEST DESCRIPTION MUST FALL SO FAR BELOW THE BRIGHT REALITY AND WHEN THE VERY ACT OF REDUCING HER BEAUTY INTO HARD COMMONPLACE WORDS SEEMS IN SOME MANNER A SACRILEGE AGAINST THE SANCTITY OF THAT BEAUTY
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HUMAN LIFE IN THE TICKET-OFFICE OR THE WAITING-ROOMS
VERY WEAK AND VERY FOOLISH WHEN I THINK THERE CAN BE ANYTHING IN THAT OLD STORY TO TOUCH YOUR HEART MR DUNBAR
AND NEVER REALLY ENJOYED DICKENS HALF AS MUCH AS SHE PRETENDED
I KNOW IT'S VERY FOOLISH OF ME PHILIP SHE SAID BUT I CAN'T HELP BEING FRIGHTENED
DON'T SAY YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ME MR DUNBAR REPEATED THE MAJOR
AND THIS SPLENDID DWELLING-PLACE RENDERED ALMOST SACRED BY LEGENDARY ASSOCIATIONS AND HISTORICAL RECOLLECTIONS WAS NOW THE PROPERTY OF A CERTAIN SIR PHILIP JOCELYN--A DASHING YOUNG BARONET WHO HAD BEEN ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH A HANDSOME FACE FRANK FEARLESS EYES THAT GENERALLY HAD A SMILE IN THEM AND THE KIND OF MANLY FIGURE WHICH THE LATE MR G.P.R
AND I HAD SPECIAL REASON TO REMEMBER THAT CRUEL FAREWELL INTERVIEW AND THE STRANGE SCENE IN THE CORRIDOR AT THE REINDEER ON THE NIGHT OF HER RETURN FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY
HE WAS RESPECTED AND HE WAS FEARED IN HIS HOUSEHOLD
IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT HENRY DUNBAR MIGHT AVOID JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER FROM A NATURAL HORROR OF THE EVENTS CONNECTED WITH HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND
A PARCEL SIR SHE SAID LINGERING A LITTLE
LAURA MIGHT GO WHERE SHE LIKED ALWAYS PROVIDED THAT SHE WENT UNDER THE CARE OF A SUITABLE CHAPERONE
I WON'T DISTURB HER FOR SHE MUST WANT REST AFTER SITTING UP HALF LAST NIGHT CLEMENT CLOSED THE DOOR AS NOISELESSLY AS HE HAD OPENED IT AND THEN WENT SLOWLY TO THE SITTING-ROOM
YOU'D BETTER COME ABOARD HE SAID
GOOD-BYE YOUR PORTMANTEAU'S IN THE CARRIAGE SIR THE SERVANT SAID POINTING TO THE OPEN DOOR OF A FIRST-CLASS COMPARTMENT
BUT YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF RATHER IN THE WRONG BOX BY-AND-BY MY YOUNG LADY WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF COMMITTED TO PRISON FOR PERJURY
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW DEAREST FATHER WHAT A BITTER SORROW THIS CRUEL SEPARATION HAS BEEN TO ME
BUT HE COULD HEAR THE GIRL TALKING TO HER FATHER
HE HAD SAILED FOR CALCUTTA FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS BEFORE AND HAD EVER SINCE BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE OFFICES OF THE INDIAN BRANCH OF THE BANK
BUT IT WAS VERY DARK AND THE NORTH-EASTERLY WINDS WERE BLOWING AMONGST THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES OF GIANT OAKS AND ELMS
RUT HE WAS A GOOD AND A JUST MAN
WHY MARGARET IS WITH YOU IS SHE NOT SHE EXCLAIMED
THE JOURNEY TO KYLMINGTON AND THE HOPE THAT TAKES ME THERE WILL DO ME MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE DRUGS IN MR BAINHAM'S SURGERY
IF MR DUNBAR HAD BEEN IN ANY WAY CONCERNED IN THIS MATTER HE WOULD HAVE MADE A POINT OF SEEING YOU IN ORDER TO SET YOUR SUSPICIONS AT REST
NOT FROM ANY LOVE TOWARDS THE MAN BUT ALWAYS INFLUENCED MORE OR LESS BY THE REFLECTION THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS LAURA'S FATHER
THERE WAS A BRIEF SCRAMBLE A BANGING OF DOORS AND BABEL-LIKE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
THERE WAS NO DISH EVER DEVISED BY MORTAL COOK WHICH THE SOJOURNER AT THE REINDEER COULD NOT HAVE ACCORDING TO THE PRELIMINARY STATEMENT OF THE LANDLORD
ARTHUR LOVELL DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO THE THOUGHTFUL GIRL
PORTLAND PLACE AUGUST 30 1850 THE BANKER TOOK OUT HIS CHEQUE-BOOK WROTE A CHEQUE FOR FIFTY POUNDS AND FOLDED IT IN THE NOTE WHICH HE HAD JUST WRITTEN THEN HE RANG THE BELL AND GAVE THE NOTE TO THE ELDERLY MANSERVANT WHO WAITED UPON HIM
BY-AND-BY HE STOOD AGAINST A WOODEN PILLAR IN A DOORWAY LOOKING AT THE CABS AS ONE AFTER ANOTHER THEY TORE UP TO THE STATION AND DISGORGED THEIR LOADS
I WENT WITH JOSEPH WILMOT THROUGH THE CATHEDRAL YARD AND DOWN TOWARDS ST CROSS
FOR HE NO LONGER SUSPECTED HENRY DUNBAR
THAT WAS MY END AND AIM
THE SLIMY GREEN STUFF AND MUDDY WATER DRIPPED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BASKET AS HE CARRIED IT
IT'S ONLY THREE O'CLOCK
ALL THAT I COULD SAY TO HER WAS SCARCELY ENOUGH TO SHAKE HER RESOLUTION--TO UPROOT HER CONVICTION THAT HER FATHER'S GUILT WAS AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER BETWEEN US
GOOD-BYE LOVELL
SURELY IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITH A LITTLE CLEVER MANAGEMENT TO THROW THE BANKER COMPLETELY OFF HIS GUARD AND TO BRING ABOUT THE LONG-DELAYED INTERVIEW BETWEEN HIM AND MARGARET WILMOT
MY OWN DEAR LOVE
AND HENRY DUNBAR HIMSELF
THE BANKER WATCHED HIS SHABBY ACQUAINTANCE UNTIL MAJOR VERNON WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
LAURA LEFT THE NEWFOUNDLAND ON THE LANDING-PLACE AND WENT BACK TO HER FATHER
THEY'RE BOTH BLIND
HE HAD BEEN STRANGLED SIR
SOMETIMES SHE WORE A COQUETTISH LITTLE HAT WITH A TURNED-UP BRIM AND A PEACOCK'S PLUME
SEVERAL LADIES ALL MORE OR LESS SUNBURNT
THE NEXT UP ISN'T TILL 12.7--I CAN BE SPARED THE PORTER RAN AWAY PRESENTED HIMSELF TO A HIGHER OFFICIAL TOLD HIS STORY AND OBTAINED A BRIEF LEAVE OF ABSENCE
AS YET HE HAD THOUGHT VERY LITTLE OF THE FUTURE LADY JOCELYN
I DON'T THINK SO
DO YOU--DO YOU--SLEEP WELL ASKED MAJOR VERNON IN A WHISPER
QUITE AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAYS
AND THE YOUNG LAWYER WAS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL CLIENT
THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED WAS HENRY DUNBAR
HAVING SENT FOR THIS PERSON LAURA BADE THE DETECTIVE GOOD MORNING AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE VISTA OF ROOMS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL TO THAT BRIGHT MODERNIZED WING OF THE HOUSE WHICH PERCIVAL DUNBAR HAD IMPROVED AND BEAUTIFIED FOR THE GRANDDAUGHTER HE IDOLIZED
THAT LAST LOOK HAD SHOWN CLEMENT AUSTIN A PALE RESOLUTE FACE SOMETHING LIKE THE COUNTENANCE OF A FAIR YOUNG MARTYR GOING QUIETLY TO THE STAKE
SHE HAD PUT ON MOURNING
BUT AS HE WAS VERY RICH PEOPLE READILY OVERLOOKED SUCH SMALL FAILINGS AS SELFISHNESS AND WANT OF HEART AND WERE LOUD IN PRAISE OF THE GRACES OF HIS MANNER AND THE ELEGANCE OF HIS PERSON
I AM VERY POOR COMPANY AND I SHALL BE GLAD TO BE ALONE WITH THE TIMES
YOUR GRAN'PA SPILED YOU MISS LAURA
IT CONSISTED OF THESE FEW WORDS H.D EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS ON OR ABOUT THE 19TH INST PER STEAMER ELECTRA
PALER AND THINNER EH
HE WENT BACK TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM AND KNEELING DOWN BEFORE ONE OF THE OPEN PORTMANTEAUS TOOK OUT EVERY ARTICLE WHICH IT CONTAINED SLOWLY
NOW THE BUSINESS IN WHICH I AM ENGAGED IS--IS RATHER OF A DIFFICULT NATURE AND I WANT LEGAL HELP
AND IT MAY BE ONLY NATURAL THAT IT SHOULD BE SO FOR WE WERE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT WHEN AT LAST THE DAY OF OUR MEETING CAME WE MET LIKE STRANGERS AND THERE WAS A BARRIER BETWEEN US THAT COULD NEVER BE BROKEN DOWN
FATE HAS THROWN HENRY DUNBAR ONCE MORE ACROSS MY PATHWAY
I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AT ONE TIME A VERY SINCERE AFFECTION FOR ME
EVERY HOPE THAT HE HAD CHERISHED IS SWEPT AWAY FROM HIM
MR BALDERBY WHO WAS A GOOD-HEARTED MAN WAS DISTRESSED AT THE IDEA OF SAMPSON WILMOT'S DESOLATION
I'LL JUST THROW MY EYE OVER YOUR PLACE DOWN BELOW HE SAID IF YOU'LL HAND ME A LANTERN THIS REQUEST WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH VERY WILLINGLY
AS HENRY DUNBAR IS COMING HOME IN A FEW DAYS WE MAY AS WELL KNOW THE REAL TRUTH
HE WAS NOT A BAD MAN FOR HE WAS HONEST CONSCIENTIOUS INDUSTRIOUS AND PERSEVERING
YES HE SAID I DINED FIVE HOURS AGO
A CRISIS VERY COMMON TO YOUTH AND VERY LIGHTLY REGARDED BY YOUTH BUT A SOLEMN AND A FEARFUL CRISIS NOTWITHSTANDING
AT PRESENT WE HAVE ONLY TO DO WITH THE DIAMOND-NECKLACE FOR MY DAUGHTER
NOW RUNNING TO THE DRESSING-TABLE TO MAKE SOME NEW ARRANGEMENT ABOUT THE ALL-IMPORTANT WEDDING-TOILET
AND HE HAD HEARD THAT THE EARLY LIFE OF HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN THAT OF A SELFISH SPENDTHRIFT
AND THAT WOULD INDEED BE A SAVAGE BEAST WHICH COULD MOLEST SUCH A PURE AND LOVELY CREATURE CHAPTER VII
MR DUNBAR HAVE GONE SIR AND NOBODY IN THAT HOUSE DON'T KNOW WHY HE WENT OR WHEN HE WENT OR WHERE HE'S GONE
THE BROAD LAWN WAS SODDENED BY THAT PERPETUAL RAIN
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THIS I MUST TELL HIM THE STORY OF MY LOVE AND MY DISAPPOINTMENT
WEST-END DRESSMAKERS WERE COMMUNICATED WITH
THE MAJOR USUALLY SO IMPERTURBABLE GAVE A LITTLE START AT THE MENTION OF THE BANKER'S NAME
HOW ABOUT MR DUNBAR'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE EH THE VALET GAVE AN ELABORATE DESCRIPTION OF HIS MASTER'S LOOKS
PRAY DO NOT THINK ME INTRUSIVE OR IMPERTINENT FOR SAYING SO
HE LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE AS MARGARET APPROACHED HIM
AND A PIE SERVED IN A GOLD DISH WITH LIVE DOVES IN IT EVERY FEATHER OF EM STEEPED IN THE RAREST PERFUME WHICH THEY WAS INTENDED TO SPRINKLE OVER THE COMPANY AS THEY FLEW ABOUT HERE AND THERE
ANYHOW I THINK I HAVE BEEN WISE TO RISK IT AND FOLLOW THE CROW
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE GENTLE BOLT--EH WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN AWAY
PAPA SHE CRIED HOW COLD YOU ARE
IMPOSSIBLE IT MAY BE SO ANSWERED THE FOOTMAN WHO WAS OF AN IRONICAL TURN OF MIND
BUT ALTHOUGH THE ANGLO-INDIAN DID AMPLE JUSTICE TO THE LUNCHEON AND WASHED DOWN A SPATCHCOCK AND A LOBSTER-SALAD WITH SEVERAL GLASSES OF ICED MOSELLE THE REPROBATE ATE AND DRANK VERY LITTLE AND SAT FOR THE BEST PART OF THE TIME CRUMBLING HIS BREAD IN A STRANGE ABSENT MANNER AND WATCHING HIS COMPANION'S FACE
I WONDER WHO PAINTED THAT LOVELY FACE THERE WAS A YOUNG ARTIST HARD AT WORK AT HIS EASEL COPYING A LARGE DEVOTIONAL SUBJECT THAT HUNG NEAR THE PICTURE LAURA ADMIRED
WHEN IT GREW DARK THE MEN LIGHTED A COUPLE OF FLARING RESINOUS TORCHES WHICH MR CARTER HAD SENT FOR TOWARDS DUSK AND WORKED BY THE PATCHES OF FITFUL LIGHT WHICH THESE TORCHES THREW UPON THE WATER
BUT HE ACCEPTED THE PAYMENT WHICH HIS EMPLOYER OFFERED HIM AND AGREED TO DEPART FOR LONDON BY THE TEN O'CLOCK TRAIN
HE COULD NOT HEAR THE NAMES OF THE STATIONS
ALWAYS BROODING BROODING BROODING
PHILIP JOCELYN GENERALLY WENT TO LISFORD UPON HORSEBACK
AND THE YOUNG PERSON WILL DO WELL TO ABANDON THE SYSTEM OF ANNOYANCE WHICH SHE IS AT PRESENT PURSUING
AND WOULD HAVE DESPISED THE EVEN TENOR OF LIFE AND THE MODERATE PROFITS OF A BUSINESS IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
A DIZZY FAINTNESS HAD SEIZED UPON HIM AND THERE WAS A STRANGE BUZZING IN HIS EARS AND UNWONTED CLOUDS BEFORE HIS DIM EYES
AS THE BELL FOR THE UP-TRAIN WAS RINGING A MAN CAME SUDDENLY UPON THE PLATFORM AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
IT IS AT THAT TIME THAT HE IS CALLED UPON TO BE MOST CIRCUMSPECT--TO KEEP GUARD UPON HIS EVERY LOOK HIS SMALLEST WORD HIS MOST TRIVIAL ACTION,--FOR HE KNOWS THAT EVERY LOOK AND ACTION IS WATCHED
THE WINDOWS AND FIREPLACES AT THIS END OF THE HOUSE WERE IN THE TUDOR STYLE
I HAVE COUNTED THE VERY DAYS
YOU'D LIKE LARGE STONES OF COURSE THOUGH THEY EAT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
BUT HE PAID ME TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THE PICTURE SO I HAD NO REASON TO COMPLAIN
BUT THE LITTLE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN SCARCELY HEARD THIS REMONSTRANCE
DEAR PAPA TELL ME YOU ARE GLAD TO COME HOME TO YOUR POOR GIRL
THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN WAS DISTORTED AND BLACKENED BY THE AGONY OF STRANGULATION
I WAS TO COME TO YOU HERE MISS DUNBAR TO TELL YOU NOT TO EXPECT YOUR PAPA FOR SOME FEW DAYS
LAURA SIGHED HEAVILY AT LAST FOR AMONGST ALL THESE PORTRAITS THERE WAS NOT ONE WHICH IN THE LEAST POSSIBLE DEGREE RECALLED THE HARD HANDSOME FACE WITH WHICH SHE WAS FAMILIAR
SOMETIMES HE FOUND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES SITTING ON CAMP-STOOLS AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE TREES SKETCHING EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW IN THE DEEP GLADES AROUND THEM
WOULD SHE BE IN TIME SHE WAS VERY TIRED WHEN SHE CAME AT LAST TO THE IRON GATES AT THE PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE OF MAUDESLEY PARK
HE STATED THAT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE FORESTERS ARMS HE FOUND THE DECEASED QUITE DEAD AND THAT HE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DEAD SOME HOURS
AND I FANCY THAT A DEEPENING SHADOW STEALS OVER HER FACE WHEN SHE MENTIONS THAT NAME
HE WENT TO BED AND FELL ASLEEP FOR HE WAS EXHAUSTED BY THE FATIGUE OF THE DAY AND THE ANXIETY OF THE NIGHT
THOUGH YOU ARE AS KIND AS EVER TO MY LITTLE NIECE WHO MAKES WONDERFUL PROGRESS UNDER YOUR CARE
A PAIR OF CRUTCHES HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM BUT HE HAD NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIS FIRST FEEBLE TRIAL OF THEM
COULD SHE EVER AGAIN LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND SMILE AT ME REMEMBERING THIS
IT'S NOT THAT
I AM A STRANGER IN ENGLAND THE ANGLO-INDIAN SAID
SHE ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD SLOWLY AND SHE NEVER ONCE LOOKED AT ME
MR DUNBAR HAD ONLY BEEN DISCHARGED FROM CUSTODY UPON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AFTER A LONG AND WEARISOME EXAMINATION AND CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESSES WHO HAD GIVEN EVIDENCE AT THE CORONER'S INQUEST AND THAT ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY UPON WHICH THE MAGISTRATE HAD ISSUED HIS WARRANT
THE POOR GIRL IS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM AS SHE HAS NOT SET EYES UPON HIM SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD OF TWO YEARS OLD
THE AWFUL EVENT OF THE PREVIOUS DAY CAST ITS DREADFUL SHADOW UPON THEM
I SHALL MEET HARRY DUNBAR ALONE THE BED-CHAMBER IN WHICH THE SICK MAN LAY OPENED OUT OF A LITTLE SITTING-ROOM
HENRY DUNBAR WAS INFLEXIBLE
AND YET WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM THE LANDLORD SUGGESTED THAT THE MISSING MAN MIGHT HAVE FALLEN DOWN IN A FIT OR MIGHT HAVE LOITERED SOMEWHERE OR OTHER UNTIL AFTER DARK AND THEN LOST HIS WAY AND WANDERED INTO A MILL-STREAM
THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A DARK GREEN PAPER THAT LOOKED LIKE CLOTH
THE WORLD HAD HARDENED HIM
FOR TO THE RAILWAY TRAVELLER IT IS ALL OF NIGHT AFTER DARK
OTHER CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED OTHER WORK HAS ARISEN FOR THEM TO DO AND THEY HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ABANDON AN INVESTIGATION WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS
THAT'S LIBERAL ENOUGH TO START WITH
AND MR CARTER EXAMINED THESE THREE SLEEPERS AS COOLLY AS IF THEY HAD INDEED BEEN THE COFFINED INMATES OF A VAULT
SURELY SHE MIGHT DECEIVE THIS LANGUID FOOTMAN BY AFFECTING TO BE SOME HANGER-ON OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHICH OF COURSE WAS A LARGE ONE
I LIKE THE MODERN PICTURES BEST PHILIP
THE CARRIAGES REACHED THE LITTLE GATE OF LISFORD CHURCHYARD
HE WAS USED TO TAKE HIS NIGHT'S REST IN BRIEF INSTALMENTS AND WAS SNORING COMFORTABLY THREE MINUTES AFTER THE GUARD HAD BANGED-TO THE DOOR OF HIS CARRIAGE
YOU WOULD HAVE BANISHED ME HAD YOU FELT THAT MY LOVE WAS HOPELESS
BUT A CASHIER IN A LONDON BANK HAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO PLAY ANY PART IN LIFE'S HISTORY EXCEPT THAT QUIET ROLE WHICH SEEMS CHIEFLY TO CONSIST IN LOCKING AND UNLOCKING IRON SAFES PEERING FURTIVELY INTO MYSTERIOUS LEDGERS AND SHOVELLING ABOUT NEW SOVEREIGNS AS COOLLY AS IF THEY WERE WALLSEND OR CLAY-CROSS COALS
YES MR AUSTIN I WILL ORDER A FLY FOR YOU THEN
BY HEAVENS HE CRIED ANGRILY I WILL HAVE THIS GIRL REMOVED BY THE POLICE IF HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND HIS HEAD SANK ONCE MORE UPON HIS BREAST
A NAME NEATLY WORKED IN DARK CRIMSON THREAD--A CHRISTIAN AND SURNAME IN FULL
THE MASSIVE CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE OF BLACK OAK WITH CUSHIONS OF GREEN VELVET
UNTIL THE NOISE OF IT GREW HIDEOUS AND INTOLERABLE--A PERPETUAL THUNDER DEAFENING AND BEWILDERING HIM
STOP THAT MAN HE ROARED TO ONE OF THE FISHERMEN
AND LAST OF ALL SHE WANTED A MUSICAL GOVERNESS
FOR THE WATER WHERE HE WAS FOUND WASN'T THREE FOOT DEEP
I WAS GLAD FOR THE SAKE OF THE GUILTY AND MISERABLE CREATURE HIMSELF THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD ESCAPED
FOR WE SHALL BE ABLE TO CATCH THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK EXPRESS HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
IT IS VITALLY NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD HAVE A LEGAL ADVISER TO WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS ON MY BEHALF
BUT WAS TO LEAVE A NOTE WITH THE STATION-MASTER FOR HIS CHIEF'S GUIDANCE CONTAINING INFORMATION AS TO WHAT HE HAD DONE
ON THE TRACK
FATHER SHE SAID I HAVE NEVER KNOWN ONE HOUR'S PEACEFUL SLEEP SINCE THE NIGHT I LEFT THIS ROOM
BOTTLED IT HIMSELF I SUPPOSE
THE TREACHERY WHICH HAD LURED THE VICTIM TO HIS DEATH SEEMED ALMOST LESS HORRIBLE THAN THE DIABOLICAL ART WHICH HAD FIXED UPON THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN THE BLACK STIGMA OF A SUSPECTED CRIME
MEANWHILE HE TOOK A HEARTY BREAKFAST WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY PREPARED BY THE WIFE OF HIS FRIEND AND FOLLOWER AND EXPLAINED THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS BEFORE THEM
SHE GOT OUT AND ASKED ONE OF THE PORTERS TO GET HER A FLY
I THINK WE'RE SAFE TO CATCH HER MR CARTER TOOK A CUPFUL OF RUM AT THE INSTIGATION OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE BUSINESS THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
FOR HOWEVER DUSTY AND STIFLING THE ATMOSPHERE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE MIGHT BE IT WAS BETTER TO BE THERE VICTORIOUS OVER MY SORROW BY MEANS OF MAN'S GRANDEST ALLY IN THE BATTLE WITH BLACK CARE--TO WIT HARD WORK--THAN TO BE LYING ON THE SOFA IN MY MOTHER'S PLEASANT DRAWING-ROOM LISTENING TO THE CHEERY CLICK OF TWO KNITTING-NEEDLES AND THINKING OF MY WASTED LIFE
THERE WAS AN OLD BOX A BATTERED AND DILAPIDATED HAIR-TRUNK WITH A WORN ROPE KNOTTED ABOUT IT
I WAS ONLY MORTAL CLEMENT AUSTIN
IT'S THE STRANGEST CASE THAT EVER CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE BUT IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT CLUE TO IT
AND YOU'VE MY BEST WISHES DEAR BOY
HAVE YOU COME TO BRING ME ANY NEWS OF MY FATHER SHE SAID
FROM THE FIRST HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO LIKE HENRY DUNBAR
IF YOU COULD GET HER TO TALK TO YOU SHE WOULD NO DOUBT BE VERY MUCH BENEFITED
I WENT OVER ALL THIS GROUND AGAIN THEREFORE FOR MR CARTER'S EDIFICATION AND TOLD HIM WORD FOR WORD ALL THAT MARGARET HAD SAID TO ME
NOW AS YOU MAY BE NO MORE INCLINED TO TRUST ME THAN THAT YOUNG WHIPPER-SNAPPER OF YOURS FOR ALL YOU'RE SO UNCOMMON CIVIL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO
AT BASINGSTOKE HE WAS INFORMED THAT AN OLD MAN TRAVELLING WITH HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL
SURELY YOU DO NOT IMAGINE--YOU DO NOT FEAR THAT I IMAGINE NOTHING LADY JOCELYN
BUT HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF GOING TO BED OR EVEN TRYING TO SLEEP
I NEVER DID SEE SUCH A FORGETFUL WOOL-GATHERING YOUNG LADY IN ALL MY LIFE AS YOU ARE THIS BLESSED MORNING MISS DORA THE ABSENT-MINDED YOUNG LADY ROSE SUDDENLY BEWILDERED BY MRS MADDEN'S ANIMATED DESIRE FOR AN INSPECTION OF THE BONNET
THERE WAS SOMETHING SUBLIME IN THE TONE OF THAT ONE WORD--SOMETHING SUPERB IN THE GIRL'S FACE AS HER EYES MET THE HAGGARD GAZE OF THE MURDERER
YOU UNDERSTAND YES SIR THEN YOU CAN GO
THE FORM OF HIS HEAD AND FACE DENOTED FORCE OF INTELLECT
OF COURSE NOT MY DEAR BOY UNLESS YOUR OWN AMBITION TAKES YOU THERE
AND YOU TOLD ME YOU CAME FROM THE OFFICE
FORTUNE WHO CERTAINLY SPOILS SOME OF HER CHILDREN HAD BEEN ESPECIALLY BENEFICENT TO THIS YOUNG MAN
NO POINTED CHINS AND ANGULAR KNEES AND ELBOWS AND FRIZZY RED HAIR--RED SIR AND AS FRIZZY AS A BLACKAMOOR'S--AND I'M TOLD THE YOUNG PEOPLE CALL THAT FEMALE BEAUTY
MR BALDERBY OPENED BOTH LEDGERS AND PLACED THEM BEFORE HIS SENIOR PARTNER
BUT HE MAY BY CHANCE BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME SLIGHT ASSISTANCE MR KERSTALL LEFT HIS VISITORS FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE RETURNED TO SAY THAT HIS FATHER WAS QUITE READY TO RECEIVE SIR PHILIP AND LADY JOCELYN
THE LIPS OF THE MILLIONAIRE WERE AS COLD AS ICE
A VAST DESERT OF BRUSSELS CARPET WITH LITTLE ISLANDS OF CHAIRS AND TABLES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE
THE OLD MAN CHUCKLED AS HIS SON EXHIBITED THE PICTURES AND EVERY NOW AND THEN VOLUNTEERED SOME SCRAP OF INFORMATION ABOUT THESE VARIOUS WORKS OF ART TO WHICH HIS SON LISTENED PATIENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY
WE ARE VERY HAPPY
WE ARE VERY HAPPY
AND I WAS SURPRISED AT THE END OF A WEEK'S TIME TO READ THE ACCOUNT OF A DETECTIVE'S SKIRMISH ON BOARD A SCHOONER SOME MILES OFF HULL WHICH HAD RESULTED IN THE DROWNING OF ONE STEPHEN VALLANCE AN OLD OFFENDER
WE KNOW MR DUNBAR BECAUSE HE'S A GREAT MAN A PUBLIC CHARACTER AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
THE HORRIBLE STAMP OF ASSASSINATION WAS BRANDED UPON THAT RIGID BROW
BUT HE WAS LAME HE CRIED
PERHAPS THIS MAY HAVE HAD SOME INFLUENCE UPON HIS FEELINGS IN THIS HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE FATHER OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
YOU WANT TO SEE MY PICTURES SIR
THE MAJOR RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH A GESTURE OF ENJOYMENT AS HE LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCES OF WEALTH THAT WERE HEEDLESSLY SCATTERED ABOUT THE APARTMENT
AND BEFORE HE HAD DONE MORE THAN SET HIS FOOT UPON HIS NATIVE SOIL HE WAS SEIZED UPON BY OBSTINATE AND PIG-HEADED OFFICIALS AND THROWN INTO A PRISON
REMEMBER THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED LONG IN THE EAST INDIES ARE APT TO BECOME COLD AND LANGUID IN THEIR MANNERS
IT'S A GOOD DODGE A VERY NEAT DODGE AND IF SAWNEY HADN'T BEEN AT THE STATION MR JOSEPH WILMOT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US THE SLIP AS NEATLY AS EVER A MAN DID YET
A FINE PLACE HE EXCLAIMED
ALREADY THE GOOD CITIZENS OF WINCHESTER HAD BEGUN TO HINT THAT THE GROVE NEAR ST CROSS WAS HAUNTED
TWO OR THREE SENSATION LEADERS APPEARED IN SOME OF THE MORNING PAPERS URGING THE BLOODHOUNDS OF THE LAW TO DO THEIR WORK AND TAUNTING THE MEMBERS OF THE DETECTIVE FORCE WITH SUPINENESS AND STUPIDITY
BUT THE BOROUGH WAS SLOPTON-ON-THE-TEES--SLOPTON--YES YES I REMEMBER THAT THE YOUNGER KERSTALL TOOK AWAY THE MEMBER FOR SLOPTON AND PUT ANOTHER PICTURE ON THE EASEL
TWO THOU IS COMFORTABLE HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
SHE HAD LEFT OFF TREMBLING NOW AND CARRIED THE SHADED LAMP AS STEADILY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN BENT ON SOME SIMPLE WOMANLY ERRAND
NOW I SHOULD PREFER THE EVENING AS I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE DEAR CHILD'S LESSONS
MY DEAR CLEMENT SHE SAID AT LAST I'M REALLY GROWING QUITE UNEASY ABOUT MADGE
NOW I'VE UNDERTAKEN THIS AFFAIR AND I WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT CONSCIENTIOUSLY
HE HAD GIVEN THIS SOLEMN PROMISE TO LAURA WHO HAD IN VAIN TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM AGAINST EVEN THIS RACE
THEY'RE ONLY KEPT TO SELL
HE ONLY SPOKE WHEN HIS OLD MASTER ADDRESSED HIM
I HAVE COME TO INQUIRE FOR A LADY WHO TEACHES MUSIC I SAID
BUT THEY TALK ME DOWN AND SAY I WAS MISTAKEN
I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND SAT BY THE FIRE TRYING TO READ A NEWSPAPER BUT UNABLE TO CHAIN MY THOUGHTS TO THE PAGE
THE BANKER
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE PICTURE ON THAT EASEL IS THE PORTRAIT OF MR DUNBAR'S ONLY SON MR KERSTALL THE YOUNGER LOOKED AT LAURA JOCELYN FULL
BEFORE YOU MOVE RIGHT OR LEFT OR SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN YOU MUST BUY ME AN ANNUITY THE BANKER SHOOK OFF HIS COMPANION'S HAND AND TURNED ROUND UPON HIM PALE STERN AND DEFIANT
FOR HE HAD BEEN SILENT AND MELANCHOLY THROUGHOUT THE DRIVE FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY TO LISFORD CHURCH AND HAD STARED AT THEM WITH VACANT INDIFFERENCE WHILE HANDING THEM OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WITH A MECHANICAL KIND OF POLITENESS THAT WAS ALMOST INSULTING
BUT THAT UNCHANGING PALLOR WAS THE ONLY SIGN OF THE MALADY FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED
THE MAN IN THE FUR-LINED COAT SHOWED TWO ROWS OF WOLFISH TEETH BARED TO THE GUMS IN A MALICIOUS GRIN
I HAD TO PERFORM A DUTY TO SOCIETY BY GIVING MY UTTERMOST HELP TOWARDS THE DISCOVERY OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S MURDERER
I'LL RING WHEN I WANT DINNER I SAW THE WAITER'S EYES OPEN TO AN ABNORMAL EXTENT AS HE LOOKED AT THE CONSTABLE AND I SAW A SUDDEN BLANK APPREHENSION CREEP OVER HIS FACE AS HE RETIRED VERY SLOWLY FROM THE ROOM
AND TO THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY TO OFFER A MEASLY HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A GREAT CRIME
SO VERY FEW PEOPLE SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING AMISS WITH THE GRAVE YOUNG MUSIC-MISTRESS
BUT THE ROOM IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR SAT LOOKED THE VERY PICTURE OF COMFORT AND ELEGANCE
THERE ARE PLEASANT GARDENS WHERE THE FLOWERS SEEM TO GROW BRIGHTER IN THE SANCTIFIED SHADE THAN OTHER FLOWERS THAT FLAUNT IN THE UNHALLOWED SUNSHINE
EVEN THE TONES OF HIS VOICE AND HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING BETOKENED A STRENGTH OF WILL THAT VERGED UPON OBSTINACY
AND I DO LOVE YOU DEAR PAPA TRULY AND DEVOTEDLY THOUGH I CANNOT EVEN REMEMBER YOUR FACE AND HAVE NOT SO MUCH AS A PICTURE OF YOU TO RECALL YOU TO MY RECOLLECTION THE LETTER WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND HENRY DUNBAR WAS STILL READING IT WHEN JOSEPH WILMOT CAME INTO THE ROOM
FOR IF HE ISN'T TO BE TRUSTED WITH THE DEAREST FAMILY SECRET THAT EVER WAS KEPT SACRED BY AN HONEST MAN WHY HE'S A SCOUNDREL AND YOU'RE MUCH BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIS HELP
I WILL TELL THEM THAT SHE IS THE NOBLEST AND DEAREST OF WOMEN AND THAT HER HISTORY IS A STORY OF UNPARALLELED VIRTUE AND DEVOTION I SENT A TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE TO MY MOTHER EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
TO RIDE AND HUNT AND DRIVE--TO DO AS SHE LIKED IN SHORT
GOOD NIGHT BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THAT MR BALDERBY COULD SAY CLEMENT AUSTIN STEADILY ADHERED TO HIS RESOLUTION
WHAT MORE IN THE NAME OF FEMININE FRIVOLITY CAN A GIRL WANT
AND AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE HALF-HOUR I WAS ON THE PLATFORM WITH MY TICKET FOR KYLMINGTON IN MY POCKET CHAPTER XLVII
PERHAPS HE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SUSPICIONS THAT HAD ENTERED HIS MIND AFTER THE FIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE BANKER AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD HE SEEN MUCH OF HENRY DUNBAR
BUT HE STILL WENT ON WITH HIS WORK
EVERYBODY WHO LOOKED AT HIM SAW THE CHANGE WHICH THE LAST TEN DAYS HAD MADE IN HIS APPEARANCE
BUT SURELY THIS SUDDEN THRILL OF TRIUMPH AND DELIGHT WHICH FILLED HER BREAST AS CLEMENT SPOKE TO HER MUST BE IN SOME DEGREE AKIN TO LOVE
WHICH THEY'RE ALL TALKIN ABOUT IT AT THE HOUSE SIR AND HOW A POOR INVALID GENTLEMAN WHAT COULD SCARCE STIR HAND OR FOOT SHOULD GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SADDLE HIS OWN HORSE AND RIDE AWAY AT A RAMPAGEOUS RATE
BUT SHE VERY WILLINGLY LEFT THE ROOM WITH LAURA'S OLD NURSE WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE HER MANDATES OBEYED EVEN BY THE WAYWARD HEIRESS OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY
SHE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME IN THE FEARFUL EXCITEMENT OF THIS NIGHT'S WORK THE YOUNG MAN WAS BY NO MEANS PLEASED BY THIS IDEA
THE ADDRESS ON THE CARD WAS NO
HAD MR DUNBAR DETAINED HER AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY AGAINST HER WILL
HE BETRAYED NONE OF THE IMPATIENCE WHICH IS NATURAL TO A MAN WHO IS KEPT WAITING BY ANOTHER
THE FOOTMAN WHO WAS SUFFERING ACUTELY FROM THE COMPLAINT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF CAME OUT OF THE PORCH AND STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS MARGARET STARING AT THE BIRDS AS THEY FLEW WESTWARD
WHEN I SPEAK TO HER SHE DOES NOT ANSWER ME BY SO MUCH AS A LOOK
THE JOCELYNS HAD BEEN HARD RIDERS FOR HALF-A-DOZEN CENTURIES OR SO AND CRACK SHOTS EVER SINCE THE INVENTION OF FIREARMS
HE HAD TAKEN NO HIGH HONOURS AT OXFORD
A NOBLE MANSION IN PORTLAND PLACE
BUT I WILL NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM I WILL NOT ABANDON THE DEAR HOPE THAT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE TO-NIGHT UNTIL YOU TELL ME PLAINLY THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ME
AND THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE RICH MAN SEEMED TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE AS HE REFLECTED UPON IT
AN EASEL STOOD NEAR THE LARGE WINDOW
THE MAN JOSEPH WILMOT WAS HER FATHER
THEY HAD COME TO MAUDESLEY TO ACT AS HER BRIDESMAIDS ACCORDING TO THAT FAVOURITE PROMISE WHICH YOUNG LADIES SO OFTEN MAKE TO EACH OTHER AND SO VERY OFTEN BREAK
SINKING THE PAST VI
HE STOOD IN A CARELESS ATTITUDE PLAYING WITH THE GOLDEN TRINKETS AT HIS WATCH-CHAIN WITH THE HOT AUGUST SUNSHINE STREAMING UPON HIS FACE FROM A BARE UNSHADED WINDOW OPPOSITE HIM
HIS THICK GREATCOAT WAS OF A DARK OLIVE-GREEN AND THE COLLAR TURNED UP OVER HIS EARS WAS OF A SHINY-LOOKING BROWN FUR WHICH TO THE CONFIDING MIND OF THE POPULACE IS KNOWN AS IMITATION SABLE
BUT WHAT MORE LIKELY THAN THAT WILMOT WAS HIS REAL NAME
THE SCHOONER THAT HAD MADE SO LITTLE WAY BEFORE SEEMED NOW TO FLY IN THE FAINT NIGHT-WIND
THE STORY OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE CLOTHES FOUND AT WINCHESTER WAS MADE PUBLIC TOGETHER WITH THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S FLIGHT AND ESCAPE
YOU THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW ALL THE TIME
I GAVE HIM THE LETTER
AND THE ARISTOCRACY OF CLAPHAM REMARKED THAT THE YOUNG PERSON WHOM MRS AUSTIN AND HER SON HAD TAKEN UP WAS REALLY RATHER NICE-LOOKING
I SHALL LEAVE THE CLOTHES IN HIS CARE FOR JOSEPH WILMOT WILL BE TRIED AT THE WINCHESTER ASSIZES
BUT HE SAW NO MORE OF THAT EVER-CHANGING PROSPECT THAN IF HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER
WERE I A POET I SHOULD COVER REAMS OF PAPER WITH WILD RHAPSODIES ABOUT HER BEAUTY
EVERYBODY KNEW WHO MISS DUNBAR WAS AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED TO THE YOUNG BARONET
BUT OF COURSE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE NECESSARY TO YOU
BUT YOU ARE WELCOME TO EXAMINE THE PLACE FROM GARRET TO CELLAR IF THAT'S ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU HE RANG A BELL AS HE SPOKE
BUT JOSEPH WILMOT WAS ONLY A DROP IN THE GREAT OCEAN OF LONDON LIFE
THE DAY IS PAST--THE DAY IS PAST AND GONE--AND THE CHANCE GONE WITH IT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE THEN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IF HIS LOVE HAD BEEN HOPELESS
GET OUT OF THE WAY OR WE SHALL RUN YOU DOWN OH NO YOU WON'T MR SPELSAND ANSWERED ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN FROM THE BOAT
WHAT A HORRIBLY DISMAL MORNING MISS DUNBAR EXCLAIMED
HE MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN HAD HE PLEASED TO DO SO
I HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THE DOOR AS YOU WENT IN AND I HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THE DOOR AGAIN AS YOU CAME OUT AND PLAYING THE SPY UPON ME NOT AT ALL DEAR BOY
HENRY DUNBAR OPENED IT WENT OUT INTO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
GOD SPEED YOU FATHER!--GOD HELP YOU HE IS THE GOD OF SINNERS THOUGHT THE WRETCHED GIRL
PLEASED WITH HER CRIED THE GOOD SOUL
SAWNEY'S GOT THE TRUMP CARDS THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN SO WRAPT UP IN THIS BUSINESS THAT I FORGOT THE DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE TO YOU
BUT I AM STILL MORE ALARMED BY HER MANNER NOW THAT SHE HAS RETURNED
AND THE TRADESMEN WHO HAD SERVED HIM TESTIFIED TO HIS MERITS AS A PROMPT AND LIBERAL PAYMASTER
HE TOLD HOW HENRY DUNBAR HAD LOITERED AT THE DOOR OF THE CATHEDRAL AND AFTERWARDS LINGERED IN THE QUADRANGLE WAITING FOR THE COMING OF HIS SERVANT
YOU HAVE COME TO TELL ME OF SOME NEW TROUBLE SHE CRIED
MY MOTIVE FOR LEAVING THIS HOUSE WHICH IS A KIND OF SECOND HOME TO ME IS NO FRIVOLOUS ONE BELIEVE ME
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A GALVANIC BELT OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT
WHO EVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SUCH A DELICIOUS OLD BRICK HE THOUGHT
I WON'T BE DOWN-HEARTED
HE WANTED TO RUN AWAY AND LOOK FOR MARGARET THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW HOW OR WHERE TO SEEK FOR HER
AND UNLESS YOU ARE A MESSENGER SENT AFTER ME FROM THE OFFICE YOU MUST BE UNDER A MISTAKE
I PLOTTED TO WIN YOUR LOVE
POOR GENTLEMAN HE SAID I DON'T THINK I EVER SEE THE LIKE OF ANYTHING AS COME OVER HIM SO SUDDEN
A BREATH A WHISPER PERHAPS
EVERYTHING WAS VERY ELEGANT VERY SUBDUED AND ARISTOCRATIC
THE LIGHTS WERE BEGINNING TO TWINKLE HERE AND THERE IN THE WINDOWS
BUT THE STERNEST OFFICIALS SMILED WHEN THEY SPOKE OF HIM AND RECALLED THE BOYISH FOLLIES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS NAME
THE RECTOR HIMSELF HAD A COLD IN HIS HEAD AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO OMIT ALL THE N_'S AND M_'S IN THE MARRIAGE SERVICE
I GAVE YOU THE OFFICE JUST NOW HE SAID BECAUSE I THOUGHT IF YOU SPOKE TO ME THAT OLD CHAP WOULD LEAVE OFF TALKING AND I MIGHT MISS SOMETHING THAT WAS ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE DID HE TELL YOU MUCH NO
IF SHE GOES AWAY IN HER PRESENT FRAME OF MIND SHE MAY SPREAD A HORRIBLE SCANDAL AGAINST YOU
WHAT WOULD SATISFY YOU NOW MY GOOD FELLOW I LEAVE THAT FOR YOU TO DECIDE VERY WELL THEN
HULL HULL HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
SUPPOSE WE TRY SHELF NUMBER ONE AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND MR HENRY DUNBAR UP THERE MR KERSTALL JUNIOR MOUNTED UPON A CHAIR AND BROUGHT DOWN ANOTHER HEAP OF CANVASES DIRTIER THAN ANY PREVIOUS COLLECTION
I'M READY TO DO MY DUTY I AM SURE OF THAT SAMPSON WHEN AM I TO START FOR SOUTHAMPTON SIR WELL I THINK YOU'D BETTER GO TO-MORROW SAMPSON
THERE ARE QUAINT OLD COURTYARDS AND SHADOWY QUADRANGLES HEREABOUTS
I HAD BEEN TO THE STATIONER'S SHOP WHICH STILL BORE ABOVE ITS WINDOW THE FADED LETTERS OF THE NAME JAKINS THOUGH THE LAST OF THE JAKINSES HAD LONG LEFT KYLMINGTON
IT WAS VERY DRY WEATHER LAST AUGUST AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER AND THE WATER WASN'T ABOVE HALF AS DEEP AS IT IS NOW IS IT THE SAME DEPTH EVERY WHERE MR CARTER ASKED
AND FOR EVERY DISGRACE THAT HAS EVER FALLEN UPON ME--FOR EVERY SORROW I HAVE EVER SUFFERED--FOR EVERY SIN I HAVE EVER COMMITTED--I LOOK TO ONE MAN AS THE CAUSE MARGARET WENTWORTH HAD RISEN TO HER FEET
HOW FAR IS IT FROM HERE TO WINCHESTER HE ASKED PRESENTLY
WELL HE SAID TAPPING SAWNEY TOM ON THE SHOULDER HE'S GIVEN YOU THE SLIP
OH YES SIR ANSWERED THE WAITER
THE POOR HIGH-BORN LADY LOUISA MACMAHON WAS LEFT MOST DESOLATE AND MISERABLE AFTER THE DEATH OF HER FIRST HUSBAND
AND YET IT WAS ONLY SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE ADJOURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND MISS WENTWORTH WAS NOT DUE UNTIL HALF-PAST SEVEN
THIS MAN WAS HENRY DUNBAR
HOW FAR DO YOU MEAN TO GO I AM PREPARED TO SPEND SOMETHING BETWEEN FIFTY AND EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS THE DIAMOND MERCHANT PURSED UP HIS LIPS REFLECTIVELY
SHE WAS A MERE BABY WHEN SHE LEFT INDIA
HE MUST KNOW THAT YOU AND I CANNOT BE ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE STORY OF HIS YOUTHFUL PECCADILLOES AND HE WILL SCARCELY GIVE HIMSELF AIRS TO US I SHOULD FANCY I DON'T KNOW THAT MR BALDERBY THE CASHIER ANSWERED
ONLY THE HILLS GRAND AND CHANGELESS TOWERED ABOVE THE MISTS AND MADE THE LANDMARKS OF THE SODDENED COUNTRY
BUT I COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BUT MY MOTHER'S DESCRIPTION OF MARGARET'S VISIT
PREVIOUS TO MY DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE I SETTLED UPON HER THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE AND THE YORKSHIRE PROPERTY
OR IT MAY BE THE IDENTICAL LAMP OVER THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE YOU'RE BOUND FOR
I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED OF MYSELF WHEN MY MOTHER REWARDED THIS FALSEHOOD BY A KISS DECLARING THAT I WAS A DEAR CLEVER BOY AND SUCH A JUDGE OF CHARACTER AND THAT SHE WOULD RATHER CONFIDE IN A STRANGER UPON THE STRENGTH OF MY INSTINCT THAN UPON ANY INFERIOR PERSON'S EXPERIENCE
HER LIFE HAD BEEN A HARD ONE AND SHE WAS BETTER ABLE TO HIDE HER SORROWS AND ANXIETIES THAN ANY ONE TO WHOM SUCH A BURDEN HAD BEEN A NOVELTY
THE CHANGE THAT CAME OVER IT WAS SO SUDDEN AND SO AWFUL IN ITS NATURE THAT THE OLD CLERK STARTED BACK AS IF HE HAD SEEN A GHOST
AND YOU LOOK IT
THOSE GLITTERING DROPS THAT LOOKED LIKE FOUNTAIN SPRAY WERE SOME OF THE DIAMONDS BOUGHT BY JOSEPH WILMOT
THROUGHOUT THE DRIVE THE BANKER HAD BEEN IN VERY EXCELLENT SPIRITS SMOKING CHEROOTS AND ADMIRING THE LOVELY ENGLISH LANDSCAPE THE SPREADING PASTURES THE GLIMPSES OF WOODLAND THE HILLS BEYOND THE GREY CATHEDRAL CITY PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE
HE HAD BEEN TORTURED BY THE IDEA THAT THE ANGLO-INDIAN HAD MURDERED HIS OLD SERVANT IN ORDER TO REMOVE OUT OF HIS WAY THE CHIEF WITNESS OF THE CRIME OF HIS YOUTH
ARRESTED XIII
I WISHED TO AVOID SEEING YOU
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S WOOING XXVIII
AND ALL TO BE SEEN FOR NOTHING
SHE NEVER PAUSED OR SLACKENED HER PACE UNTIL SHE REACHED THE LANE LEADING DOWN TO THE WATER
I LOVE YOU
BUT SHE HAD TOLD NO ONE THE MANNER OF THAT DEATH
THREE WHO SUSPECT
MR DUNBAR PROMISED THAT HE WOULD SEE ME AT WINCHESTER
THE WOMAN WHO KEPT IT WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY AND HAD KNOWN CLEMENT AUSTIN IN PERCIVAL DUNBAR'S LIFETIME
PRECISELY
I ALMOST FEAR TO ASK MYSELF WHICH WHERE DID THE DECEASED JOSEPH WILMOT SAY HE LEFT HIS BROTHER SAMPSON MR DUNBAR ASKED THE CORONER
SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHOM HER FRIENDS CALL GUSHING AND SHE CALLED BYRON A LOVE AND SHELLEY AN ANGEL BUT IF YOU TRIED HER WITH A STANZA THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE TO DEATH IN GEMS OF VERSE OR STRINGS OF POETIC PEARLS OR DRAWING-ROOM TABLE LYRICS SHE COULDN'T TELL WHETHER YOU WERE QUOTING BYRON OR BEN JONSON
AND MANTON THE GUNMAKER ONLY SECOND TO DR JENNER AS A BENEFACTOR OF HIS RACE
WRITE DOWN THE ANSWERS AS PLAIN AS YOU CAN
HEAVEN KNOWS I HOPE SHE MAY BE HAPPY HE DID NOT STOP TO MAKE ANY CEREMONIOUS ADIEU TO HIS GUESTS BUT WALKED STRAIGHT TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS
THE ROPE BY WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD BEEN STRANGLED WAS ALSO PRODUCED AND EXAMINED
AND IF THE LIMB WAS SKILFULLY SET THERE WOULD NOT BE THE LEAST FEAR OF CONTRACTION
MOST OF THE REMAINDER IS FLOATING IN EXCHEQUER BILLS THEN YOU CAN REALIZE THE EXCHEQUER BILLS MR BALDERBY WINCED AS IF SOME ONE HAD TRODDEN UPON ONE OF HIS CORNS
AND WILL INSURE ME BREAD EVERY DAY
HOW HENRY DUNBAR WAITED DINNER X
AND HE HAD NO IDEA OF TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THIS GENTLEMANLY-LOOKING CLERK FROM ST GUNDOLPH LANE
SHE MUST HAVE GOT HOME BEFORE ME THE CASHIER THOUGHT
YOU'VE GUESSED RIGHT ENOUGH CHILD EXCEPT THAT YOU'VE OMITTED ONE FACT
MR CARTER QUESTIONED THE GUARDS THE TICKET-COLLECTORS THE PORTERS THE CABMEN
REMEMBER I DO NOT WISH TO BE DISTURBED AGAIN TO-NIGHT YOU WILL WANT NOTHING MORE SIR NOTHING THE MAN RETIRED
HE POINTED OUT THE DOOR AT WHICH HENRY DUNBAR HAD GONE INTO THE CATHEDRAL THE PATHWAY WHICH THE TWO MEN HAD TAKEN AS THEY WENT TOWARDS THE GROVE
3 GODOLPHIN COTTAGES I ASKED THE FIRST PERSON I MET TO DIRECT ME TO GODOLPHIN COTTAGES AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE SECOND TURNING ON MY RIGHT
AND HOW I'VE SEEN MY POOR SCHEMES CRUSHED WHEN I HAD BUILT THEM UP WITH MORE PATIENCE THAN PERHAPS MAN EVER BUILT BEFORE
SHE ROSE AS ARTHUR LOVELL CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SHE LOOKED MORE LIKE A LILY THAN EVER IN HER LONG LOOSE MORNING-DRESS OF SOFT SEMI-DIAPHANOUS MUSLIN
I WILL NOT SEE HER EXCLAIMED MR DUNBAR
THIS IS TUESDAY
I THINK I MAY COUNT ON YOUR STANDING BY ME--EH MY LADS HE ASKED
BUT IF HE HAVE YOU NEEDN'T GLARE AT ME LIKE THAT FOR IT AIN'T NO FAULT OF MINE
THE FOG GOT THICKER AND THICKER IN THE CHURCH AS THE HOUR FOR THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY DREW NEARER AND NEARER AND THE LIGHT OF THE WAX-CANDLES GREW BRIGHTER AS THE ATMOSPHERE BECAME MORE MURKY
I COULD NOT FAIL TO DO SO
I DON'T CARE ABOUT LOOKING AT ANY MORE PICTURES TO-DAY PHILIP SHE SAID
SO SHE MADE NO OBJECTION TO HIS ABANDONING HIS DESK IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
SPEAK TO HER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE
THE STROKE OF DEATH V
THE BANKER NEVER STIRRED FROM HIS DOZE AND EVEN THE DOG AT HIS FEET SLEPT ON
NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE NEW ZEALANDER WHO MAY HAVE NEW AND EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS AS TO FEMALE LOVELINESS AND MAY REQUIRE A BLUE NOSE OR PEA-GREEN TRESSES IN THE LADY HE ELECTS AS THE ONLY TYPE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMANHOOD
SHE IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND PERCIVAL DUNBAR IDOLIZED HER
BUT THE MASTER OF THE CROW WAS A QUEER CHAP ALTOGETHER AND MORE THAN ONE ABSCONDING BANKRUPT HAD SAILED FOR FURRIN PARTS IN THE CROW
BUT I THINK THAT SOUND PROTESTANT THOUGH SHE MAY BE IN EVERY OTHER ARTICLE OF FAITH AMIDST ALL HER PRAYERS THOSE ARE NOT THE LEAST FERVENT WHICH SHE OFFERS UP FOR THE GUILTY SOUL OF HER WRETCHED FATHER
MR DUNBAR DID ONE THING MORE BEFORE HE LEFT THE ROOM
WHO CAN WONDER THEN THAT A CRIMINAL IS GENERALLY A COWARD AND THAT HE BETRAYS HIMSELF BY SOME BLIND FOLLY OF HIS OWN THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SUBJECT AND HAD SPOKEN WITH A STRANGE ENERGY
SHE IS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF MY ONLY SISTER MARIAN LESTER AND HAS BEEN NEWLY IMPORTED FROM SYDNEY WHERE MY SISTER MARIAN AND HER HUSBAND HAVE BEEN SETTLED FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS
IN FACT TO TELL YOU THE HONEST TRUTH SAID THE DETECTIVE WITH A SIMPLICITY OF MANNER THAT WAS REALLY CHARMING
I LOVE YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU LOVE ME
HE WAS COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH SNOW WHEN HE STOPPED BEFORE THE STONE PORCH AND RANG A BELL THAT MADE A CLANGING NOISE IN THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
YOU CAN SEND UP THE DINNER
YOU'LL BE OUT GENERALLY YOU KNOW CLEM MY MOTHER SAID
YOU'LL BE ALTOGETHER WRAPPED UP IN THOSE LETTERS OF YOURS WHICH MUST BE WRITTEN BEFORE THE LONDON POST GOES OUT
CARRIAGES DROVE IN AND OUT OF THE GREAT GATES IN THE PARK AND ALL THE LANDED GENTRY WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF THE ABBEY CAME TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE MILLIONAIRE WHO HAD NEWLY RETURNED FROM INDIA
THE HOPE OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS AND A PLEASANT HOME
FIRST HE LOITERED ABOUT THE QUAYS A LITTLE TAKING STOCK OF THE IDLE VESSELS THE BIG STEAMERS THAT WENT TO LONDON ANTWERP ROTTERDAM AND HAMBURG--THE LITTLE STEAMERS THAT WENT SHORT VOYAGES UP OR DOWN THE RIVER AND CARRIED TROOPS OF SUNDAY IDLERS TO BREEZY LITTLE VILLAGES BESIDE THE SEA
BUT COULD HE REMAIN THERE
AND SAYS SHE WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE CHARGE OF THIS HERE KEY AND BE SO KIND AS TO SHOW ANY ONE OVER THE COTTAGE AS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT WHICH OF COURSE THE COMMISSION IS UNDERSTOOD?--FOR MY MASTER IS LEAVING FOR SOME TIME ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING A SON JUST COME HOME FROM INDIA WHICH IS MARRIED AND SETTLED IN DEVONSHIRE AND MY MASTER IS GOING THERE TO SEE HIM NOT HAVING SEEN HIM THIS MANY A LONG YEAR SHE WAS A VERY CIVIL-SPOKEN YOUNG WOMAN AND WOODBINE COTTAGE HAS BEEN GOOD CUSTOMERS TO US BOTH WITH THE OLD TENANTS AND THE NEW
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE QUESTIONED BY SUCH A JACKANAPES AS THAT SHOPBOY OF YOURS THE LANGUID YOUTH FOLDED HIS ARMS AND ENDEAVOURED TO LOOK FEROCIOUS IN HIS FIERY INDIGNATION
AND I AM NEVER HAPPIER THAN ON THOSE DUSKY SUMMER EVENINGS WHEN WE SIT ALONE TOGETHER IN THE SHADOWY DRAWING-ROOM AND TALK TO EACH OTHER WHILE MARGARET'S SKILFUL FINGERS GLIDE SOFTLY OVER THE KEYS IN WANDERING SNATCHES OF MELODY THAT MELT AND DIE AWAY LIKE THE LOW BREATH OF THE SUMMER WIND END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF HENRY DUNBAR BY M
BUT LAURA DUNBAR WAS TOO INNOCENT TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THOSE EAGER WORDS
IT WAS RATHER A LONG ONE
LITTLE BITS THAT WILL SEEM NOTHING AT ALL TILL YOU PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND READ THEM OFF THE RIGHT WAY
AND SO I WENT OUT AGAIN WITH THE PRESPIRATION STREAMIN DOWN MY FACE AND I WALKED THAT BLESSED TOWN TILL OVER ONE O'CLOCK THIS MORNIN LOOKIN RIGHT AND LEFT AND INQUIRIN AT EVERY PLACE WHERE SUCH A GENT WAS LIKELY TO TRY AND HIDE HISSELF AND PLAYING UP MAG'S DIVARSIONS WHICH IF IT WAS DIVARSIONS TO MAG WAS ONCOMMON HARD WORK TO ME
THEY'RE FOUND HE CRIED
HER HEART IS STILL BEATING WITH A STRANGE VAGUE TERROR WHEN HER LOVER RIDES QUIETLY PAST THE STAND AND THE PEOPLE ABOUT HER CRY OUT THAT THE RACE HAS BEEN NOBLY WON
DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY'S ESTABLISHMENT
BUT MARGARET'S PALE FACE SEEMED A MUTE APPEAL FOR COMPASSION
MR CARTER GNASHED HIS TEETH TOGETHER IN A SILENT FURY
REMEMBER YOU ARE AN ONLY SON
IS THERE ANY USE IN SUCH A JOURNAL AS MINE
ARTHUR LOVELL QUESTIONED THIS PERSON AS TO THE APPEARANCE AND MANNER OF THE MAN HE HAD MET
YES I REMEMBERED THERE WAS A TOWN IN HAMPSHIRE,--A KIND OF WATERING-PLACE I BELIEVED,--CALLED KYLMINGTON
DO YOU CONSIDER IT A GOOD LIKENESS THE YOUNG LAWYER LOOKED AT THE PORTRAIT WITH A TENDER SMILE
AS IT WAS MR CARTER COULD ONLY SEE THAT SHE HAD PRETTY BROWN EYES WHICH SHIFTED LEFT AND RIGHT AS HE LOOKED AT HER
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A SECOND-CLASS RETURN TICKET AND FOR HIS GLASS OF GIN-AND-WATER AT A LONDON TAVERN
AND THE SAME SHADOW THAT HAD CLOUDED IT ONCE DURING THE COURSE OF THE CORONER'S INQUEST RESTED UPON IT NOW
BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN
AND SHE AFTER THE WAY OF WOMANKIND LOVED HIM DEVOTEDLY AND BELIEVED HIM TO BE THE NOBLEST AND MOST BRILLIANT OF MEN
BUT THE DOCTOR--MR CRICKLEWOOD A VERY RESPECTABLE GENTLEMAN SIR--SAYS THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN LYING IN THE WATER HOURS AND HOURS AND THAT THE MURDER HAD BEEN DONE HOURS AND HOURS AGO THE MURDER CRIED HENRY DUNBAR
BAFFLED
LITTLE GROUPS CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN THE BAR DISCOURSING IN SOLEMN UNDER-TONES
THERE WERE FAINT ODOURS OF SOFT SOAP IN THE BED-CHAMBERS WHICH NO AMOUNT OF DRIED LAVENDER COULD OVERCOME
AND WHICH GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT SWELLED INTO THE AWFUL WORD MURDER HENRY DUNBAR HEARD IT AND UNDERSTOOD IT FOR HIS HANDSOME FACE GREW OF A BLUISH WHITE LIKE SNOW IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE LEANED HIS HAND UPON THE OAKEN BALUSTRADE
HE WIPED THEM AWAY WITH HIS PERFUMED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF AS HE SPOKE
CHANGE OF SCENE ACTIVITY HURRYING FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN NEW COUNTRIES AND AMONGST STRANGE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE USUAL INFLUENCE UPON ME
I WISH HE LOVED ME BETTER PERHAPS IF HE LOVED YOU TOO WELL HE'D KEEP YOU INSTEAD OF GIVING YOU AWAY MISS LAURA OBSERVED MRS MADDEN WITH EVIDENT ENJOYMENT OF HER OWN WIT
IF I HADN'T GOOD CAUSE TO REMEMBER THE DATE BECAUSE OF MY OWN TROUBLES I SHOULD REMEMBER IT FOR ANOTHER REASON FOR IT WAS THE WATERLOO YEAR AND CITY PEOPLE HAD BEEN LOSING AND MAKING MONEY LIKE WILDFIRE
HE TRIED TO SPEAK ONCE OR TWICE BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WAS POWERLESS TO FORM THE WORDS THAT WERE IN HIS MIND
STOPPED UPON THE WAY
ALREADY HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN TWICE WITH PARALYSIS AND HE KNEW THAT WHENEVER THE THIRD STROKE CAME IT MUST BE FATAL
AND ONE OF THE WAITERS ATTENDED UPON THE RICH MAN
THE JANUARY WIND HAD BLOWN HER HAIR ABOUT HER FOREHEAD IN LOOSE DISORDERED TRESSES
BUT HE DID NOT PARTICULARLY AFFECT THE SOCIETY OF HENRY DUNBAR
BUT HE STILL STARED AT ME WITH THE SAME RELENTLESS AND STONY GAZE AND HE STILL FINGERED HIS KNEES FOLLOWING UP HIS RIGHT HAND WITH HIS LEFT AS SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY AS IF HE HAD BEEN COMPOSING A FUGUE AFTER THE MANNER OF MENDELSSOHN
MR DUNBAR HAD EXPRESSED A WISH TO GO ABROAD IN SPITE OF HIS BROKEN LEG AND HAD ONLY DESISTED FROM HIS DESIGN OF BEING CONVEYED SOMEHOW OR OTHER FROM PLACE TO PLACE WHEN HE WAS TOLD THAT ANY SUCH IMPRUDENCE MIGHT RESULT IN PERMANENT LAMENESS
AND THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A MAN IS FOR HIM TO SUCCEED IN HIS FIRST CRIME
THAT'S ALL
WAIT FOR THE END MR AUSTIN AND WAIT PATIENTLY
WHAT WORDS CAN PAINT THE EQUAL PLEASURE OF GIVING AND RECEIVING THOSE LESSONS IN THE ART WHICH WAS LOVED ALIKE BY PUPIL AND MASTER
LAURA FELT SOMETHING OF THIS
COAT DARK BLUE CLOTH LINED WITH SABLE
HE NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS DAUGHTER OR THE ANGUISH HIS PROLONGED ABSENCE MIGHT CAUSE HER TO SUFFER
DELICIOUS
THERE WAS A BLACK FOG UPON THIS NOVEMBER DAY AND THE ATMOSPHERE OUT OF DOORS WAS COLD AND BLEAK
AND IF I'D REMAINED IN ENGLAND THE CONNECTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS TO ME
FORGET THE TAINT UPON YOUR DEAD FATHER'S NAME AS FREELY AS I FORGET IT DEAREST
I CAN ONLY SAY AGAIN WHAT I SAID BEFORE MOTHER--TRUST ME THE WIDOW SIGHED AND SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING GESTURE
I MUST GET TO LONDON THE SURGEON AND HIS ASSISTANT REMOVED MR DUNBAR'S CLOTHES
COME SAWNEY DON'T YOU GO TO CUT UP ROUGH ABOUT IT SAID MR CARTER COAXINGLY
THOUGH I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN VERY WELL BE BETTER OFF ANYWHERE THAN YOU ARE HERE HE ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
HER EYELIDS TREMBLED AND SHE HAD THE LOOK OF A PERSON WHOSE SENSES HAD BEEN DAZED BY EXCITEMENT AND CONFUSION
SHE'S THE MOST DETERMINED YOUNG WOMAN I EVER SAW MR DUNBAR'S FACE WAS STILL HIDDEN BY THE NEWSPAPER
ENGLISH BUCKINGHAM MAY HAVE WORN THE SAME INSOLENT SMILE UPON HIS LIPS THE SAME BRIGHT TRIUMPH IN HIS GLANCE WHEN HE WALKED UP TO THE THRONE OF LOUIS THE JUST WITH THE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS DROPPING FROM HIS GARMENTS AS HE WENT ALONG AND WITH FORBIDDEN LOVE BEAMING ON HIM OUT OF AUSTRIAN ANNE'S BLUE EYES
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY IN MY BEHALF SIR HE SAID VERY QUIETLY
THERE YOU WERE SURE ENOUGH
THAT WEALTH CONSISTED OF A SPLENDID ESTATE IN WARWICKSHIRE
THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED NERVOUSLY AS HE GOT OUT OF THE CARRIAGE BEFORE THE MAHOGANY DOORS OF THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
THAT COULD NEVER BE ENDURED AT ANY COST
DON'T TOUCH ME--DON'T COME NEAR ME IT'S JUST LIKE A WOMAN TO TAKE THE BRIBE AND THEN BE SORRY FOR HAVING TAKEN IT I SAID NOTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS
HER FACE FLUSHED HER EYES GREW BRIGHT AND AN OMINOUS SMILE LIT UP HER COUNTENANCE
THEN PULLING HIS BROTHER'S MEMORANDUM-BOOK FROM HIS POCKET HE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT THE LITTLE PACKET OF BANK-NOTES
SO SO WHISPERED JOSEPH WILMOT THIS IS THE JUNIOR PARTNER'S LETTER OF WELCOME TO HIS CHIEF
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM OUT OF THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW
THE EXPRESS GOING NORTHWARDS HAD RUN INTO THE TRAIN FROM SHORNCLIFFE WHICH HAD COME UPON THE MAIN LINE JUST NINE MINUTES TOO LATE
MARGARET'S REFUSAL TO FULFIL HER ENGAGEMENT HAD SET IN MOTION THE MACHINERY BY MEANS OF WHICH THE SECRET OF THIS FOUL MURDER HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
BUT THE MELANCHOLY SHADOW ON HIS FACE CHANGED INTO A GRIM SMILE AS HE GLANCED FROM THE TAPESTRIED WALLS AND CURTAINED WINDOW WITH A GREAT INDIAN JAR OF HOTHOUSE FLOWERS STANDING UPON AN INLAID TABLE BEFORE IT AND FILLING THE ROOM WITH A FAINT PERFUME OF JASMINE AND ALMOND TO THE FIGURE OF HENRY DUNBAR
THE SPECTATORS RECOILED AGHAST WITH INDIGNANT ASTONISHMENT
LAURA STARTED TO HER FEET
SHE COULD SEE THE GENTLEMAN RIDERS GOING IN AND OUT AND THE ONE RIDER ON WHOSE SAFETY HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED MUFFLED IN HIS GREATCOAT AND VERY BUSY AND ANIMATED AMONGST HIS GROOMS AND HELPERS
YOU WILL WANT PLENTY OF MONEY HE SAID THOUGH OF COURSE MR DUNBAR WILL BE WELL SUPPLIED
THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM WERE VERY HAPPY
IT WAS GROWING DUSK AND THE TWILIGHT SHADOWS UPON JOSEPH WILMOT'S FACE MADE IT IN ITS SULLEN GLOOM DARKER EVEN THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
AND THE FIRST THING THIS MORNIN I WAS ON MY BLESSED LEGS AGAIN AND DOWN AT THE QUAY INQUIRIN ABOUT VESSELS AND THERE'S NOTHIN LIKELY TO SAIL AFORE TO-NIGHT AND THE VESSEL AS IS EXPECTED TO SAIL TO-NIGHT IS BOUND FOR COPENHAGEN AND DON'T CARRY PASSENGERS
BUT BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE PUBLIC OFFICES TO THE BACK OF THE HOUSE HE WAS STOPPED BY A GENTLEMANLY-LOOKING MAN WHO CAME FORWARD FROM A DESK IN SOME SHADOWY REGION AND INTERCEPTED THE STRANGER
SHE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
HE REMEMBERED SUCH A ROOM AS THIS LONG AGO ACROSS A DREARY GULF OF FORTY ILL-SPENT YEARS
AND ON REVIVING FROM HIS FAINTING FIT HE LOOKED VERY SUSPICIOUSLY AT HIS ATTENDANTS AND PUT HIS HAND TO THE BUCKLE OF HIS BELT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIMSELF SURE THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH
CAN YOU HEAL MY MOTHER'S BROKEN HEART,--BROKEN LONG AGO BY MY DISGRACE
WHY AS FAR AS THAT GOES THERE WAS NO MORE GROUND FOR SUSPECTING MR DUNBAR--NOT THAT HAS COME OUT YET AT ANY RATE--THAN THERE IS FOR SUSPECTING ME AND THE PORTER SNAPPED HIS FINGERS CONTEMPTUOUSLY
NOT ALONE FOR DORA MACMAHON WAS SOMETIMES WITH HER AND THE FAITHFUL ELIZABETH MADDEN WAS ALWAYS AT HAND TO PLAY PROPRIETY AND TO KEEP A SHARP EYE UPON THE INTERESTS OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS
THAT'S NO MATTER
THE GIRL WAS SCARCELY LESS QUIET THAN HER SLUMBERING COMPANION
HE SAT QUIETLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO AND THEN LOWERED THE WINDOW NEAR HIM AND LET IN A RUSH OF ICY WIND WHEREAT THE BALD-HEADED COMMERCIAL GENTLEMAN TURNED UPON HIM RATHER FIERCELY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND IF HE WANTED TO GIVE THEM ALL INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS BY LETTING IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS TWO DEGREES BELOW ZERO
WHAT THE
I WAS FAIN TO CONFESS WITH MUCH CONFUSION THAT I HAD NOT DONE ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS
IS IT I WHO AM GOING MAD
WHO KNOWS WHAT DARK SUSPICIONS MAY ARISE AFFECTING MY NAME AND HONOUR THE BANKER MADE THIS REMARK IN THE PRESENCE OF FOUR OR FIVE OF THE JURYMEN THE CORONER AND MR CRICKLEWOOD THE SURGEON WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO EXAMINE THE BODY OF THE MAN SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED
THE MAN THROUGH WHOSE RECKLESS SIN MY FATHER LIVED A LIFE THAT LEFT HIM OH
NOTHING COULD PRESENT A STRONGER CONTRAST THAN THE MANNER OF HENRY DUNBAR THE BANKER AND THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ELECTED TO BE CALLED MAJOR VERNON
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN
IT WAS BY HIS CONTRIVANCE THE GIRL HAD BEEN SENT FROM INDIA
EGAD
DON'T LOOK ANXIOUS DEAR MOTHER
AND IF YOU CAN DISPOSE OF THE RAILWAY BONDS TO ADVANTAGE YOU MAY DO SO YOU THINK OF SPENDING I THINK OF REINVESTING THE MONEY
LADY LOUISA DUNBAR HELD HER PLACE IN CALCUTTA SOCIETY FOR TWO YEARS
CLEMENT WAS STARTLED BY THE BLANK WHITENESS OF HER FACE THE FIXED STARE OF HER DILATED EYES
YOU'LL HAVE EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF DIAMONDS AT THEREABOUTS READY FOR ME WHEN I CALL HERE ON THURSDAY MORNING
I SAW HIS FATHER'S DEATH IN THE PAPER LAST MARCH
YOU SIGNED AN ORDER FOR THE TRANSFER OF MY FATHER'S MONEY TO MY ACCOUNT SOME TIME IN LAST SEPTEMBER I DID IN CONCURRENCE WITH MR LOVELL PRECISELY
I MAY FALL IN WITH A BIT OF LUCK PERHAPS
HUMPH MURMURED THE ANGLO-INDIAN PULLING HIS GREY MOUSTACHES WITH A REFLECTIVE AIR
BUT HER FACE WAS STILL AVERTED AND THE TREMBLING HAND WHICH MR AUSTIN WAS HOLDING STRUGGLED TO RELEASE ITSELF FROM HIS GRASP
AND CLEMENT HAD BEEN ADMITTED INTO THE HOUSE AS A BOY AND HAD RECEIVED MUCH NOTICE FROM PERCIVAL
SOLD BY THAT HAZEL-EYED HOUSEMAID WITH HER FACE TIED UP
AND THE PROPRIETOR OF THE GEORGE WISHED TO DO HIM HONOUR
IS IT IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THIS YES SIR GOOD
BUT THE LINEN SHIRT WAS LEFT AND THE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT WORN BY THE BANKER WAS UNDER THIS SHIRT NEXT TO AND OVER A WAISTCOAT OF SCARLET FLANNEL
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY EXACTLY BECAUSE YOU SEE SIR I DIDN'T KEEP NO PARTICULAR COUNT OF THE TIME AND I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO TELL A FALSEHOOD YOU MUST NOT TELL A FALSEHOOD
IN HER EYES I MUST HENCEFORTH APPEAR THE MAN WHO HAD VOLUNTARILY SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO DISCOVER HER FATHER'S GUILT AND TRACK HIM TO THE GALLOWS
I WAS NEVER IN MY LIFE PRESENT AT AN INQUEST
BUT I WAS TIRED OF CATECHIZING THE FAIR ADVERTISERS AS TO THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND WENT OUT ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING FOR A SOLITARY RAMBLE AMONGST THE QUIET SURREY SUBURBS IN ANY LONELY LANES OR SCRAPS OF COMMON-LAND WHERE THE SPECULATING BUILDER HAD NOT YET SET HIS HATEFUL FOOT
IT IS STRANGE HE SAID
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU KNEW ME OF OLD AND WOULD BE WISE ENOUGH TO KEEP A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD WITH ME
I COULD HEAR HIS VOICE BUT I COULDN'T HEAR THE WORDS WHAT TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN MR DUNBAR AND THE DECEASED LEAVING THE CATHEDRAL YARD AND MR DUNBAR RETURNING ALONE THE VERGER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT HENRY DUNBAR
THE ANGLO-INDIAN SMILED A LITTLE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
TELL YOUR EMPLOYER THAT I WILL RETAIN TWO OR THREE OF THESE DESIGNS MR DUNBAR SAID SELECTING THE DRAWINGS AS HE SPOKE
MARGARET'S LETTER XXXVIII
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ONE IN YOUR HAND AH THEN I SUPPOSE I WAS MISTAKEN HE STILL LINGERED IN THE PARLOUR PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES VERY SLOWLY AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE DISMAL BACKYARD WHERE THERE WAS A DINGY LITTLE WOODEN DOOR SET DEEP IN THE STONE WALL
HE WAS PALE
BUT MY MIND WAS FILLED WITH HER IMAGE
HE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE HE MIGHT HEAR HIS DEATH-KNELL FROM THE LIPS HE WORSHIPPED
HE COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF FORMIDABLE-LOOKING WORDS AND FLOURISHES IN IT AND HE FELT PRETTY WELL CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A GENUINE DOCUMENT AND MEANT MISCHIEF
THIS LAST CHARACTERISTIC HAD WON FOR HIM THE SOBRIQUET OF SAWNEY TOM AND HE WAS CONSIDERED WORTH HIS WEIGHT IN SOVEREIGNS ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS WHEN A SIMPLE COUNTRY LAD OR A VERDANT-LOOKING LINEN-DRAPER'S APPRENTICE WAS REQUIRED TO ENACT SOME LITTLE PART IN THE DETECTIVE DRAMA
AND BY DEGREES HER LIGHT FOOTSTEP WAS HEARD LESS AND LESS OFTEN IN THAT LONELY WING OF THE HOUSE WHERE HENRY DUNBAR HAD TAKEN UP HIS ABODE
SO THE ROADS WERE DRY AND HARD ONCE MORE AND THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOFS AND ROLLING WHEELS THE JINGLING OF BELLS THE OCCASIONAL BARKING OF A NOISY SHEEP-DOG AND STURDY LABOURERS VOICES CALLING TO EACH OTHER ON THE HIGH-ROAD TRAVELLED FAR IN THE THIN FROSTY AIR
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHOSE ASHES LAY BURIED UNDER THE SPOT ON WHICH I STOOD
HE DOESN'T NAME ANY PARTICULAR LAWYER
THAT'S ONE QUESTION
PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HAD SAT IN THE PONDEROUS CARVED OAK-CHAIRS
YOU CAN SEND THE CARRIAGE BACK TO THE CLARENDON BY-AND-BY
THE MAIL TRAIN STOPPED AT SHORNCLIFFE WHILE SHE WAS THINKING OF THIS FATAL POSSIBILITY
BUT WHAT OF THAT
BUT WHAT OF THAT
IT WAS RATHER A SLOW OPERATION
HE WAS THANKFUL AS HE THOUGHT THAT SLEEP WOULD BRING TRANQUILLITY AND RELIEF TO MARGARET'S OVERWROUGHT BRAIN
WHY DO YOU ASK ME THIS QUESTION SHE ASKED RATHER HAUGHTILY
A GREAT MANY WERE SAID NEVERTHELESS
I NEVER THOUGHT THOSE BILLS WOULD BE PRESENTED
DO YOU SUPPOSE WHEN A MAN HAS ONLY ONE SON A HANDSOME CLEVER HIGH-MINDED YOUNG FELLOW WHOSE PRESENCE IS LIKE SUNSHINE IN HIS FATHER'S GLOOMY OLD HOUSE--DO YOU THINK THE FATHER WANTS TO GET RID OF THE LAD
I'LL HAVE EVERY INCH OF THE BED OF THE STREAM AND EVERY HIDDEN HOLE IN THE BOTTOM DRAGGED TEN TIMES OVER BEFORE I'LL GIVE IT UP HE SAID TO ME WHEN HE CAME TO ME AT DUSK WITH SOME BRANDY THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY A BOY WHO HAD BEEN FETCHING BEER MORE OR LESS ALL THE AFTERNOON
THROUGHOUT THAT INTERVIEW I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED BY HER PRESENCE AS BY SOME SUBTLE AND MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE STRONGER THAN THE FUMES OF OPIUM OR THE JUICE OF LOTUS FLOWERS
A YOUNG MAN AS WAS IN THE COURT TOLD ME THAT THEM WAS SIR ARDEN'S EXACK WORDS THEY HAD REACHED SIR ARDEN'S HOUSE BY THIS TIME
WHAT IS IT THAT CAN PART US MARGARET MR AUSTIN CRIED
THIS WITH THE EVIDENCE OF A BOY WHO HAD MET THE DECEASED AND HENRY DUNBAR CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE AGAINST THE RICH MAN
BUT THE DAY MAY COME WHEN HE MAY WANT ME
I WAS TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE MADGE
THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE WAS VERY QUIET TO-DAY FOR IT WAS ONLY ON MARKET-DAYS THAT THERE WAS MUCH LIFE OR BUSTLE IN THE QUEER OLD STREETS AND MAJOR VERNON FOUND NO HINDRANCE TO THE BUSINESS THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM FROM LISFORD
ONE OF THE MEN ASKED THE NECESSARY QUESTIONS
THE LOVE THAT BEGINS WITH ESTEEM THAT SLOWLY GROWS OUT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOVED ONE IS SURELY THE PURER AND HOLIER TYPE OF AFFECTION
NAMELESS FRIENDLESS CHARACTERLESS HE HAS TO BEGIN LIFE AFRESH WITH EVERY MAN'S HAND AGAINST HIM
IT WOULD BE ONLY LIKE HIM TO DO IT
SO THE NERVOUS TRAVELLER FOUND NO RESPONSE TO HIS LOOK OF TERROR
I WONDER WHAT HE IS LIKE NOW
LAURA MADE HERSELF VERY MUCH AT HOME WITH HER PARISIAN ACQUAINTANCE
AND EVERYBODY THIS MORNING WAS DISTRACTED LIKE SEARCHIN IGH AND LOW
A GENIAL MATRON BENDING OVER HER WORK
IN THAT LONG HOUR BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S PATIENCE WORE ITSELF ALMOST THREADBARE
MY FRIENDS AT THE CORNER--NOT THE PICCADILLY CORNER BUT THE CORNER OF THE WASTE GROUND AT THE BACK OF FIELD LANE--HAVE DONE ME THE HONOUR TO GIVE ME THE RANK OF MAJOR AND I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULDN'T RETAIN THE DISTINCTION
BY-AND-BY THIS BEGAN TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGED THING
THE DISHES UPON THE TABLE WERE STILL HIDDEN UNDER THE GLISTENING SILVER COVERS
AT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON MISS WILMOT AND HER LOVER LEFT THE REINDEER IN A FLY
SHE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HAD LITTLE SENSE OF HER FATIGUE AND HER JOURNEY WAS BY NO MEANS FINISHED YET
I SHAN'T ASK ANY LEADING QUESTION BUT I SHALL WAIT QUIETLY TILL THE MURDER OF JOSEPH WILMOT CROPS UP IN THE CONVERSATION
SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE HAS CHOSEN TO ARREST ME AND I SHALL ABIDE THE ISSUE OF THAT ARREST IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE JUNIOR PARTNER PROTESTED AGAINST THIS
WHAT IF THE ELECTRA SHOULD BRING NOTHING BUT A SEALED LEADEN COFFIN AND A CORPSE EMBALMED IN SPIRIT
I HAVE SPOKEN TO HER AND SHE HAS REJECTED YOU SHE HAS PSHAW
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY EXCEPT THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FANCIED YOUR MASTER WASN'T QUITE EASY IN HIS MIND AND YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS HAVING BEEN SUSPECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE ABOUT THE WINCHESTER MURDER MR CARTER JOTTED DOWN SOME PENCIL-NOTES IN HIS POCKET-BOOK WHILE MAKING THIS LITTLE SUMMARY OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE VALET
LADY JOCELYN WAS IN MR DUNBAR'S ROOMS A FOOTMAN TOLD HIM
HE REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE CEREMONY STANDING WHERE THE LIGHT SHONE FULL UPON HIS HANDSOME FACE
NO HE CRIED WITH A SUDDEN TONE OF TRIUMPH NOT JOSEPH WILMOT BUT STEPHEN VALLANCE--BLACKGUARD STEEVE THE FORGER--THE MAN WHO ESCAPED FROM NORFOLK ISLAND AFTER MURDERING ONE OF THE GAOLERS--BEATING HIS BRAINS OUT WITH AN IRON IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU VERY PARTICULARLY
THE EASEL STOOD IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE BROAD WINDOW
HE COULD ONLY THINK OF HIS PROBABLE MEETING WITH HENRY DUNBAR
HE IS RECOGNIZED
HE WAS AS MUCH WRAPPED UP AS EVER
HE CONTRIVED TO FIND OUT A GOOD DEAL IN THIS WAY ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL AND THE HABITS OF HENRY DUNBAR IN PARTICULAR
HOW ABOUT THAT?--THE RAILWAY ACCIDENT--THE BROKEN LEG YES SIR THE WOMAN ANSWERED EAGERLY THAT'S THE VERY THING SIR
BUT YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHY IT HAS BEEN SO
YOU SEE YOUR WAY HE TURNED ROUND AND CHECKED MY EAGER CURIOSITY BY A WARNING GESTURE OF HIS UPLIFTED HAND
THE BANKER RETURNED TO HIS SEAT
NOW WHEN A MAN ALLOWS HIMSELF TO PITY A VERY PRETTY GIRL HE PLACES HIMSELF ON A MORAL TIGHT-ROPE
ME AND MY MATE WILL DO IT WON'T US JIM JIM WAS ANOTHER BURLY YOUNG FELLOW IN A BLUE GUERNSEY A FISHERMAN PART OWNER OF A LITTLE BIT OF A SMACK WITH A BROWN MAINSAIL
BETTER PERHAPS IF THIS SHOULD PROVE FATAL JOSEPH MUTTERED
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT HAD BEEN TOO BITTER AND HE HAD NO HEART TO GO OUT AMONGST HARD MEN OF BUSINESS AND BEGIN LIFE AGAIN
WOULD HE BESTOW UPON SIR PHILIP THE INESTIMABLE BLESSING OF THAT DEAR HAND
I RESPECT YOUR BROTHER SAMPSON AND SHALL RETAIN HIM IN MY SERVICE IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
BUT HE WILL NOT REFUSE
HE WAS NOT A VERY PREPOSSESSING PERSON AND HAD A HABIT OF WORKING ABOUT HIS LIPS AND JAWS WHEN HE WAS NEITHER EATING NOR TALKING WHICH WAS FAR FROM PLEASANT TO BEHOLD
HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MAN AND TO MAKE A CONFIDANT AND COMPANION OF HIM AND HE FELL INTO THE SAME MANNER NOW NATURALLY
HALF-A-DOZEN SURGEONS WERE BUSY IN ONE OF THE WAITING-ROOMS AT THE RUGBY STATION WHITHER THE SUFFERERS HAD BEEN CONVEYED AND ONE OF THEM TOOK POSSESSION OF THE BANKER
IF I HAD ASKED FOR REFERENCES AS TO RESPECTABILITY CAPABILITY AND SO FORTH
I KNOW ALL THIS EXCITEMENT HAS WORN YOU OUT NO MOTHER
THE COURSE WAS NOT CROWDED BUT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE SPRINKLING OF SPECTATORS ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROPE--SOLDIERS FROM THE SHORNCLIFFE BARRACKS COUNTRY PEOPLE AND LOITERERS OF ALL KINDS
THE TWO YOUNG MEN WENT INTO A LITTLE PANELLED ROOM LOOTING INTO THE GARDEN A COSY LITTLE ROOM WHICH ARTHUR LOVELL CALLED HIS STUDY
HENRY DUNBAR WAS AMONGST THOSE WHO WERE CARRIED AWAY HELPLESS AND TO ALL APPEARANCE LIFELESS FROM THE RUIN OF THE SHORNCLIFFE TRAIN
BUT HAVING CONCEDED SO MUCH HE SEEMED TO HAVE DONE ALL THAT HIS FRIGID NATURE WAS CAPABLE OF DOING
I AM LEASEHOLD PROPRIETOR OF WOODBINE COTTAGE NEAR LISFORD AND SHORNCLIFFE AND YOU MEAN TO SETTLE IN WARWICKSHIRE I DO HENRY DUNBAR SMILED TO HIMSELF AS HIS FRIEND SAID THIS
AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE STRONG MAN WOULD CRY ALOUD OVER HIS BLIGHTED LIFE AND THE RUIN WHICH HAD FALLEN UPON HIS YOUTH
FOR THEY WERE RICH CITY PEOPLE SIR--ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY--SOMETHING IN THE BANKING-LINE AND THE NAME THE NAME--LET ME SEE--LET ME SEE THE OLD MAN TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD THOUGHTFULLY
AND WHEREVER HE APPEARED THE MAJOR MADE HIMSELF CONSPICUOUS BY MEANS OF A VERY TALL WHITE HAT WITH A BROAD BLACK CRAPE BAND ROUND IT
A RELENTLESS AND DETERMINED MAN
THE MISERY OF ALL THIS KILLED MY MOTHER
THE MEN POINTED TO A DINGY SPECK OUT SEAWARD AS THEY GAVE MR CARTER THIS INFORMATION--A SPECK WHICH THEY ASSURED HIM WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE CROW BOUND FOR COPENHAGEN
AND IT WAS AT THIS DOOR THAT MR DUNBAR STOPPED
AND THAT NOW THOUGH YOU ARE TRULY PENITENT AND SORRY AND HAVE LONG WISHED TO LEAD AN ALTERED LIFE THE WORLD WON'T FORGET OR FORGIVE THAT OLD WRONG
THE OLD MAN NODDED AND SMILED AND CHUCKLED AS SIR PHILIP AND LAURA WERE PRESENTED TO HIM AND POINTED WITH A COURTLY GRACE TO THE CHAIRS WHICH HIS SON SET FOR HIS GUESTS
THE MOST ANCIENT PART OF THE BUILDING WAS THAT VERY NORTHERN WING WHICH MR DUNBAR HAD CHOSEN FOR HIMSELF
THE BREAKFAST EQUIPAGE WAS STILL UPON THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
HE CHOSE NO GAUDY COLOURS OR FLASHILY-CUT VESTMENTS
THE CASHIER CLOSED THE PARLOUR-DOOR AND RETURNED TO HIS DESK IN THE PUBLIC OFFICE
WELL CLEM THE TERMS ARE ALMOST RIDICULOUSLY MODERATE MY MOTHER SAID PRESENTLY
YES THEY'RE GENTLEMANLY THE OLD MAN MUMBLED
COOL HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS CLOSED LIPS
NO HARM SHALL COME OF MY GOING AWAY GIRL
IF I DARED TO PRAY TO YOU TO THINK PITIFULLY OF THAT MOST UNHAPPY MAN WHOSE SECRET IS NOW KNOWN TO YOU I WOULD DO SO
THEN HE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND RETURNED IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES CARRYING WITH HIM ALL THE TOWELS HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FIND IN MY ROOM AND HIS OWN WHICH WERE CLOSE AT HAND
SO ENTIRELY WAS SHE ABSORBED BY HER OWN GLOOMY THOUGHTS THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR A FOOTSTEP APPROACHING FROM THE OTHER END OF THE LANE
HER THICK AUBURN HAIR WAS TWISTED INTO A DIADEM THAT CROWNED HER BROAD WHITE FOREHEAD AND ADDED A COUPLE OF INCHES TO HER HEIGHT
IT WAS NOT TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE LIVERIED SERVANT WHO WAITED UPON HIM CAME TO INFORM HIM THAT HIS DINNER WAS SERVED IN AN ADJOINING CHAMBER THAT MR DUNBAR ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND PUT AWAY THE BOOK IN THE DESPATCH-BOX
I DARE SAY MY MOUTH AND CHIN ARE RATHER HARDER AND STERNER IN THEIR CHARACTER THAN LAURA'S THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SAID UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE LIKENESS
AND TAKE MY WORD FOR IT EVIL CONSEQUENCES ARE SURE TO COME FROM EVIL DEEDS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORY OF THE FORGED BILLS SAID MR AUSTIN THE CASHIER LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AS HE SPOKE
THE WOMAN WHO WAS TO NURSE THE SICK MAN CAME BY-AND-BY AND TOOK HER PLACE BY THE PILLOW
THE PAST WAS YOUR OWN AND YOU MIGHT HAVE FASHIONED IT AS YOU PLEASED
I THOUGHT THIS DREADFUL BUSINESS HAD MADE SUCH A SENSATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT MR DUNBAR BEING MIXED UP IN IT MR DUNBAR CRIED MARGARET LOOKING AT THE SPEAKER WITH DILATED EYES
NO HE COULD NOT IMAGINE THAT
CHAPTER V
HOW DARED HE--A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR AT THE MOST--HOW DARED HE DISCREDIT OR QUESTION ANY ASSERTION MADE BY HENRY DUNBAR
BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD MAN AND MY MEMORY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT USED TO BE
GOOD MORNING MAJOR VERNON HAD RETURNED TO THE ROSE AND CROWN AT LISFORD
DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD STORY OF SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD A GOOSE THAT LAID GOLDEN EGGS
WHY I'D SOONER TAKE A MESSAGE TO ONE OF THE TIGERS IN THE JOOLOGICAL-GARDINGS AT FEEDIN TIME THAN I'D INTRUDE UPON SUCH A GENTLEMAN AS MR DUNBAR WHEN HE'S SITTIN OVER HIS CLARET MR DUNBAR STOPPED TO LISTEN TO THIS CONVERSATION
TO TELL YOU THE HONEST TRUTH I'M NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON DIRECT TO LOOK AFTER THE MISSING GENTLEMAN
THE LANDLORD PASSED HIS GUEST AND RAN DOWN THE STAIRS
SHE SAYS THAT IF YOU REFUSE TO SEE HER SHE WILL WAIT AT THE DOOR OF THIS HOUSE UNTIL YOU LEAVE IT
BUT I LET HER OUT WITH MY OWN HANDS AND I SAW HER GO OUT WITH MY OWN EYES NOTWITHSTANDING THE MAN SHUT THE DOOR BEFORE CLEMENT HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN THE PORCH
THE BLOOD SURGED UP TO MY HEAD AND I STAGGERED BACK AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR
BUT HE ASKED NO FURTHER QUESTION OF THE FARMER
A THUNDERBOLT FALLING UPON THE MOROCCO-COVERED WRITING-TABLE IN MR BALDERBY'S PRIVATE PARLOUR COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN MORE ASTONISHING TO THE JUNIOR PARTNER THAN THIS LETTER WHICH CLEMENT AUSTIN HANDED HIM VERY QUIETLY AND VERY RESPECTFULLY
HE BELIEVED THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT
THE MAJOR FOLLOWED SLOWLY
HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN AFTER THE FINAL STROKE OF PARALYSIS
WHICH THEY DO SAY MRS MANDERS CONTINUED THAT MR DUNBAR HAD LAID OUT NIGH UPON HALF-A-MILLION OF MONEY IN DIAMONDS
SHE IS ALTERED FROM A PRETTY GIRL INTO A PALE HAGGARD WOMAN
I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY TO YOU THERE WAS A TENDERNESS IN THE CASHIER'S VOICE AS HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS THAT BROUGHT THE BLUSHES BACK TO MARGARET'S PALE CHEEKS
YOU'D BETTER GET OUT SAWNEY HE SAID PUTTING HIS HEAD IN AT THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO SPEAK TO HIS COMPANION
IT'S SCARCELY STRANGE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO FOR HE WAS AN ONLY CHILD
MAY I BE PERMITTED TO KNOW YOUR MOTIVE FOR THIS INTRUSION SIR THE BANKER ASKED IN A COLD REPELLENT VOICE LOOKING THE SHABBY INTRUDER FULL IN THE EYES AS HE SPOKE
THE OLD VERGER THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD SO PLEASANT A TASK AS THAT OF EXHIBITING HIS BELOVED CATHEDRAL TO THIS DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN JUST RETURNED FROM INDIA AND READY TO ADMIRE EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HIS NATIVE LAND
THEY MET AGAIN AND AGAIN
BUT EVEN IF SAMPSON WILMOT HAD LIVED TO SPEAK WHAT COULD HE HAVE TOLD
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A PORTER OR PORTRESS
JOSEPH WILMOT OBEYED HIS OLD MASTER AND ORDERED A VERY EXCELLENT LUNCHEON WHICH WAS SERVED IN THE BEST STYLE OF THE DOLPHIN
HAVE TOOK THE SAME AND GO ON WITH HIM DIRECT.--YOURS TO COMMAND T.T MR CARTER LOST NO TIME AFTER PERUSING THIS COMMUNICATION
SHE WAS STANDING AT THE LOW WOODEN GATE OPENING INTO THE LITTLE GARDEN BELOW THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM IN THE DEEPENING TWILIGHT OF THIS SEPTEMBER EVENING
TELL HIM I HAVE BEEN VERY ILL
HIS GAZE WAS FASCINATED BY THE GIRL'S AWFUL PALLOR AND THE STRANGE EXPRESSION OF HER EYES
BUT THE ANGLO-INDIAN DID NOT FLINCH
AND I'VE PAID FOR THE WORK BEING DONE MR CARTER ANSWERED BRISKLY
WHEN HE FINDS THAT I AM SO RESOLUTE AS TO FOLLOW HIM HERE HE WILL NOT REFUSE TO SEE ME THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE DURING A BRIEF WALK WHICH THE LOVERS TOOK IN THE WINTRY DUSK WHILE MRS AUSTIN NODDED BY THE FIRE IN THAT COMFORTABLE HALF-HOUR WHICH PRECEDES DINNER
BUT THIS LASTED ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS
MARGARET EXCLAIMED CLEMENT AS HE APPROACHED THE PLACE WHERE JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER WAS SITTING
HER INFLUENCE OVER HER FATHER MUST BE COMPLETE I THOUGHT OR HE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE CONSENTED TO SURRENDER SUCH A TREASURE AS THE DIAMONDS
THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE WAS THEREFORE FAMILIAR TO MR AUSTIN
IT IS REALLY TOO BAD OF HIM TO TREAT ME IN THIS MANNER
HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOT THE MURDERER OF MY FATHER
SQUARE-TOPPED HELMETS THAT HAD BEEN HACKED BY THE SCIMITARS OF SARACEN KINGS SPIKED CHAMFRONTS THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY THE FIERY BARBS OF HAUGHTY ENGLISH CRUSADERS FLUTED ARMOUR FROM MILAN HUNG AGAINST THE BLACKENED WAINSCOTING IN THE SHADOWY HALL
THEY'D WONDER WHAT DEALINGS YOU AND I COULD HAVE TOGETHER IF YOU WERE TO SHOW YOURSELF IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE IN YOUR PRESENT COSTUME MY FRIEND IS PROUD EXCLAIMED THE MAJOR WITH A MOCK TRAGIC ACCENT
IF I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY YOUR SWEET SMILE YOUR GENTLE WORDS
AT ELEVEN I PUT ON MY HAT AND OVERCOAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE RAIN
YOU'VE ENDURED IT ALL
FOR FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS IT HAD BEEN DELAYED
BUT AFTER THAT NIGHT THE OLD FAITH IN A HAPPY FUTURE CRUMBLED AWAY AND THE IDEA THAT JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER HAD LEFT ENGLAND GREW LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO CONVICTION
BUT I MUST RESPECTFULLY REMIND YOU THAT THE EXPENSES ATTENDANT UPON TAKING POSSESSION OF MY HUMBLE ABODE HAVE BEEN VERY HEAVY
THESE ROOMS ARE HORRIBLY GLOOMY THERE IS A SPARE ROOM UPON THE FLOOR ABOVE THIS SIR VERY WELL
IT WAS SCARCELY A PLACE TO OFFER ANY VERY GREAT ATTRACTION TO THE LORD OF JOCELYN ROCK IN ALL THE GLORY OF HIS EARLY MAN-HOOD
WHEN THEY'RE OVER I'LL COME AND TALK TO YOU
THE SAME MASTER I LOVED WHEN I WAS A BOY
AND HE WAS CONSPICUOUS AMONGST THE CROWD IN THOSE MYSTERIOUS PURLIEUS WHERE THE PLEBEIAN BOOKMEN WHO ARE UNWORTHY TO ENTER THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF TATTERSALL'S MOSTLY DO CONGREGATE IN UTTER DEFIANCE OF THE POLICE
I HAD SO BUILT UPON HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND THINKING THAT WE SHOULD BE NEARER AND DEARER TO EACH OTHER THAN ANY FATHER AND DAUGHTER EVER WERE BEFORE
SOMETIMES HE LIVED UPON HER OWN SLENDER EARNINGS
IS SHE A LIKELY PERSON TO BE GOVERNED BY HER TERROR OF MR DUNBAR
NOTHING THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN WILL LESSEN MY ESTEEM FOR MISS WILMOT I SAID
HIS EYES LOOKED UNNATURALLY LARGE AND UNNATURALLY BRIGHT
I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE SAID TO ME
I'VE BEEN DOWN UPON MY LUCK FOR SOME TIME PAST AND I'VE JUST GOT A BIT OF MONEY
DORA MACMAHON AND THE TWO PALE BRIDESMAIDS WITH AREOPHANE BONNETS THAT HAD BECOME HOPELESSLY LIMP FROM EXPOSURE TO THAT CRUEL RAIN TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE SECOND CARRIAGE
THEY DON'T HAVE A POPULAR MURDER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF WINCHESTER EVERY DAY
IMPOSSIBLE--UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE--SUICIDE ON YOUR PART MY DEAR SIR IF YOU ATTEMPTED IT AND MURDER UPON MINE IF I ALLOWED YOU TO CARRY OUT SUCH AN IDEA
THE DETECTIVE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND FOUND THAT IT WAS HALF-PAST ONE
HE HAD NEITHER BROTHER NOR SISTER TO INTERFERE WITH HIM
WHEN SHE LEFT ME THAT DAY AT SHORNCLIFFE SHE SUFFERED AS CRUELLY AS I COULD SUFFER
I'M QUITE READY TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL IN ANY WAY YOU MAY REQUIRE GET ME A TIME-TABLE THEN AND LET'S SEE ABOUT THE TRAINS
THAT HOUR TO WHICH MARGARET WILMOT HAD LOOKED AS THE GREAT CRISIS OF HER LIFE HAD COME
FROM WHICH MRS GRUMBLETON GATHERS THAT HE HAD NOT TOOK A ORDER FROM MR DUNBAR MAJOR VERNON WHISTLED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF WHEN MRS MANDERS RETIRED AFTER HAVING IMPARTED THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION
I HAVE AN OFFER OF AN ESTATE NORTH OF THE METROPOLIS WHICH I THINK WILL REALIZE CENT PER CENT A FEW YEARS HENCE
HAVING DONE THIS AND SHUT HIS BOOK HE PROWLED SLOWLY THROUGH THE SITTING-ROOM BED-ROOM AND DRESSING-ROOM LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH THE SERVANT CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
BUT AT NINE O'CLOCK HE CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DESPATCH-BOX JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT AND RANG THE BELL
BUT HE SCARCELY ATE HALF A DOZEN MOUTHFULS
THAT QUESTION AROSE IN HIS MIND AND TOOK A VERY SERIOUS FORM
TAKE CARE HOW YOU THREATEN ME
AND WHEN I TOLD HER THAT YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN SHE SEEMED TERRIBLY DISTRESSED
HAD IT COME AT LAST THEN THAT AWFUL MOMENT WHICH HE HAD DREAMED OF SO MANY TIMES--THAT HIDEOUS CRISIS WHICH HE HAD IMAGINED UNDER SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS
I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT IT CAN HAVE BEEN LONGER THANK YOU MR DUNBAR
I DIDN'T SUCCEED IN GETTING A GLIMPSE OF MY OLD FRIEND HENRY DUNBAR CHAPTER XXX
HE TOOK THE RUDDER OUT OF MR CARTER'S HANDS PRESENTLY AND THAT GENTLEMAN ROLLED HIMSELF IN HIS NEW RAILWAY RUG AND LAY DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT WITH ONE OF THE MEN'S OVERCOATS FOR A BLANKET AND THE OTHER FOR A PILLOW AND HUSHED BY THE MONOTONOUS PLASHING OF THE WATER AGAINST THE KEEL OF THE BOAT FELL INTO A PLEASANT SLUMBER WHOSE BLISSFULNESS WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE GRIDIRON-LIKE SENSATION OF THE HARD BOARDS UPON WHICH HE WAS LYING
WHY DO I KEEP THIS RECORD OF A MOST COMMONPLACE EXISTENCE
I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BETTER
ARTHUR LOVELL STOPPED AT PORTLAND PLACE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY AND DINED WITH THE BANKER AND HIS DAUGHTER IN THE EVENING
TIMES HAS CHANGED SIR SAID THE BEADLE TO AN IDLE-LOOKING STRANGER WHO WAS STANDING NEAR HIM
WHILE HE PAUSED THINKING WHAT HE WAS TO DO SOME LUCKY THOUGHT CAME TO HIM FOR HIS FACE BRIGHTENED SUDDENLY WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE
THE PEOPLE ABOUT ME ARE INQUISITIVE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE OVERHEARD SHE WRAPPED HER SHAWL MORE CLOSELY ROUND HER AND WENT OUT OF THE LITTLE GARDEN
EXPECTING TO SEE HER FACE BEAMING WITH SATISFACTION
BUT FOR ALL THIS HE WAS ACTIVE FOR HE ROSE VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
BUT I WON'T TALK--I DAREN'T TALK
I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE WAS WHEN HE WAS BRIGHT AND YOUNG BEFORE THE WORLD HAD HARDENED HIM
BUT DO NOT LET HENRY DUNBAR TRY TO DECEIVE ME
I WILL MISS
READ IT SHE SAID
SHE CLUNG TO THE IDEA THAT SOME INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE WOULD REVEAL THE FACT OF HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS THEREFORE SAFE ON THE YORKSHIRE SIDE
YOUR NEW BONNET'S COME HOME THIS MORNING MISS DORA ELIZABETH MADDEN SAID RATHER SHARPLY
ARTHUR LOVELL LOOKED AT HER WITH A MOURNFUL SMILE
YES HE HAD DONE THIS
THEN HE RETURNED TO MARGARET
AND WHO WAS MOREOVER A CRACK SHOT A RECKLESS CROSS-COUNTRY-GOING RIDER AND A VERY TOLERABLE AMATEUR ARTIST
THERE WAS NO CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN HER ASPECT NO COLD HAUTEUR IN HER EVER-CHANGING FACE
MR DUNBAR CRIED MARGARET IN A CLEAR RESOLUTE VOICE
BUT THAT FIRST FALSE STEP IS THE STARTING POINT UPON THE ROAD THAT LEADS TO THE GALLOWS
I'VE GOT IT ALL AT MY FINGERS'-ENDS AND I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULDN'T MAKE A TRIFLE OUT OF IT
SAMPSON WATCHED THE GLOOMY FACE OPPOSITE TO HIM FOR SOME TIME AND THEN WITH A WEARY SIGH HE DREW HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS FACE AND SANK BACK IN THE CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE
PRAY DON'T TALK ABOUT BROKEN HEARTS AND BLIGHTED LIVES AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
HENRY DUNBAR WELCOMED HIM FREELY AND THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THE POWER TO RESIST TEMPTATION
BUT I LEAVE YOU WITH A HEAVY HEART
OR PERHAPS SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE VERY STRONG OBJECTIONS TO A MATCH BETWEEN HER SON AND A YOUNG LADY WHOSE FATHER HAD SPENT A CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS LIFE IN A PENAL SETTLEMENT
BUT THE DOOR BETWEEN IT AND THE NEXT CHAMBER WAS WIDE OPEN AND MARGARET SAW THE FIRELIGHT SHINING UPON THE FADED TAPESTRY AND REFLECTED IN THE SOMBRE DEPTHS OF THE POLISHED OAK FURNITURE
THAT WAS QUEER BUT I HOPE YOU WON'T THINK ANYTHING OF WHAT I'VE LET DROP SIR SAID THE WAITER HASTILY
NO MY LORD
EXCLAIMS THE POET NOVELIST
MR BALDERBY SAT WITH THE LETTER OPEN IN HIS HANDS STARING AT THE LINES BEFORE HIM AS IF HE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO COMPREHEND THEIR PURPORT
HE WASTED HOUR AFTER HOUR AND DAY AFTER DAY IN GLOOMY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PAST
WOODBINE COTTAGE LISFORD--I SHAN'T FORGET
AND YET BY THE BYE AS THE PICTURE BELONGED BY RIGHT TO MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR AND NOT TO MY FATHER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE MAY HAVE PRESERVED IT UNINJURED THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU--FAR AWAY--WHERE YOU WITH ME SAID JOSEPH WILMOT SLOWLY
HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD NEVER LOOK UPON HER FACE AFTER THAT DAY
HE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH THE BRIGHT GEMS AND LET THEM RUN FROM ONE HAND TO THE OTHER LIKE STREAMS OF LIQUID LIGHT
HE NEVER HAD CONTEMPLATED INTERFERING IN HIS DAUGHTER'S BESTOWAL OF HER AFFECTIONS
AS IT SEEMED TO JOSEPH WILMOT IN THE FIRST TRIUMPH OF BEING ASTRIDE THE ANIMAL ONCE MORE
COME MY MEN DON'T HANG BACK
THEY'RE HIS OWN AND IT'S NOT THEM WE'RE AFTER
DO NOT ADD PERJURY TO THE CRIME YOU HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED HE SAID
I PROMISE YOU THAT
YOU'RE AFRAID TO GIVE ME YOUR CONFIDENCE OUT AND OUT WITHOUT RESERVE
I WANT TO TELL YOU--BUT THE WORDS--THE WORDS--WON'T COME--SOMEHOW SHE POINTED TO HER DRY LIPS WHICH MOVED BUT MADE NO SOUND
NOR OF ANY ONE ELSE ARTHUR LOVELL TOOK THE MILLIONAIRE'S PURSE AND WENT DOWN STAIRS WITH THE WAITER
YES FATHER THE YOUNG MAN ANSWERED GOING INTO THE ROOM
THERE WAS NO VESTIGE OF ANY CAB
MY MEMORY IS AS FRESH TO-DAY AS IT WAS FOUR-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN MY WRONGS WERE ONLY A TWELVEMONTH OLD JOSEPH WILMOT HAD SAID ALL THIS ALMOST AS IF HE YIELDED TO AN UNCONTROLLABLE IMPULSE AND SPOKE BECAUSE HE MUST SPEAK RATHER THAN FROM THE DESIRE TO UPBRAID HENRY DUNBAR
FILL YOURSELF ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE WAITER
THE FACES OF THE TWO MEN WERE OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER BUT ONLY FAINTLY VISIBLE IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE SPLUTTERING OIL-LAMP
THOUGH IT IS ONLY A MONTH SINCE THE EVENING ON WHICH I SAW THE CARD IN THE WINDOW AT WANDSWORTH MARGARET AND I SEEM TO BE OLD FRIENDS
LAURA STARTED TO HER FEET AND HER BRIGHT FACE GREW PALE
WHAT IS HER NAME?--WHO--WHO IS SHE HER NAME IS WILMOT--MARGARET WILMOT I KNOW NO SUCH PERSON ANSWERED THE BANKER HAUGHTILY BUT LOOKING NERVOUSLY AT THE HALF-OPENED DOOR AS HE SPOKE
ONE MEAGRE LITTLE ELDERLY TRAVELLER TURNED RATHER PALE AND LOOKED NERVOUSLY AT HIS FELLOW-PASSENGERS
HE FOUND THE LANDLORD WHO DIRECTED HIM TO THE FAVOURITE SHORNCLIFFE MEDICAL MAN
THERE AMIDST THE STAINS OF MUD AND MOSS I SAW SOMETHING WHICH WAS DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT FROM THEM
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME HE ASKED IN LOW ANGRY TONES
BUT ABOVE ALL IT WAS A STREET IN WHICH YOU WERE SO SHAKEN AND JOSTLED AND BUMPED AND STARTLED BY THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE PAVEMENT THAT YOU HAD VERY LITTLE LEISURE TO NOTICE THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND MISS DUNBAR--LEASTWAYS LADY JOCELYN--WAS SENT FOR EARLY THIS MORNING AND SHE'S AT THE HOUSE NOW SIR WITH HER HUSBAND SIR PHILIP
VERY DECENT QUALITY OF WINE HE SAID VERY DECENT
AS YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE YOUR VALET ABOUT YOU YOU'LL FIND IT AWKWARD SIR THE LANDLORD HAD SAID
CLEMENT WAS THERE AND THREE MEN
THAT'S THE QUESTION INDEED SIR
WHOEVER JOSEPH WILMOT MAY HAVE SOLD THOSE DIAMONDS TO HAS GOT A GOOD BARGAIN YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT AND MEANS TO STICK TO IT
THIS MATTER WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PASS OFF WITHOUT THE CLOSEST INVESTIGATION BELIEVE ME
THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS BOUGHT OVER AND SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF FOR BEING BOUGHT OVER I TOLD MR CARTER THAT I COULD NEVER BRING MYSELF TO BELIEVE THIS
IT HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THOSE DAYS ON WHICH FISH WAS TO BE HAD IN SHORNCLIFFE
ONLY THE GENTLE WAVING OF THE LEAVES THE LONG MELODIOUS NOTE OF A LONELY BIRD AND THE LOW WHISPER OF THE STREAMLET BROKE THE SILENCE
HE HAD WITNESSED THE ARRIVAL OF A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT TRAVELLERS WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY ARRESTED BY A LITTLE OLD MAN WAN AND WIZEN AND NEAR-SIGHTED FEEBLE-LOOKING BUT ACTIVE WHO ALIGHTED FROM A CAB AND GAVE HIS SMALL BLACK-LEATHER PORTMANTEAU INTO THE HANDS OF A PORTER
I FOUND MY FRIEND THE DETECTIVE STANDING IN ONE OF THE SMALLER ENTRANCES OF THE CATHEDRAL IN VERY EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH AN OLD MAN
HE WAS VERY PALE AS HE RODE CITYWARDS IN THE COMFORTABLE BROUGHAM FROM THE CLARENDON
AND THE TRAVELLER COMING A STRANGER TO THE LITTLE TOWN MIGHT FANCY HIMSELF A HUNDRED MILES AWAY FROM BOISTEROUS LONDON
I THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE REVELATION STILL SO NEW TO ME UNTIL MY BRAIN GREW DAZED
LET HE DID NOT FINISH THE SENTENCE FOR THERE WAS A SUDDEN CLAMOUR OF VOICES AND TRAMPLING AND HUBBUB IN THE HALL BELOW
I WAS RELATED TO THAT MOST UNHAPPY MAN
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SMALL FARMERS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPECULATED THEIR MONEY ON ME
I HAVE A VAGUE IDEA THAT I ATE CHERRY TART AND ROAST VEAL FRIED SOLES BOILED CUSTARD AND ANCHOVY SAUCE ALL MIXED TOGETHER
BUT PLEASE PROVIDENCE WE SHALL FIND WHAT WE WANT
SHE WANTED TO BE IN LONDON BY A PARTICULAR TIME
YOU FIND LONDON VERY MUCH ALTERED I DARE SAY MR DUNBAR SAID ARTHUR LOVELL AS HE UNFOLDED THE MORNING PAPER
MR DUNBAR WAS BROUGHT BEFORE SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE AT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS ARREST
TAKE A BASIN OF WATER AND A SPONGE FRED AND WASH THE DUST OFF
THAT GENTLEMAN WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM AND SEEMED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE VERGER'S GLANCE
MR DUNBAR OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY WHO HAS BEEN MISSING SINCE FOUR O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE GENTLEMAN IN THE EASY-CHAIR WAS SMOKING A MEERSCHAUM
THAT MISERABLE AGONIZED HEART WHICH SEEMED LIKE A BLOCK OF ICE IN HER BREAST
THERE WAS THE TRACK OF WHERE IT HAD BEEN DRAGGED ALONG THE GRASS
THEY BELONG OF RIGHT TO HER
AND A WINDING STREAM OF WATER WANDERS IN AND OUT
AND THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE RIDING RIGHT AND LEFT LOOKIN FOR HIM SIR
WHEN HE WAS CLOSE UNDER THE SIDE THE CAPTAIN OF THE CROW FLUNG OUT A ROPE
TO TELL THE TRUTH THE HONEST-HEARTED CREATURE WAS VERY MUCH PLEASED TO FIND THAT HER YOUNG LADY WAS GOING TO BE A BARONET'S WIFE AFTER ALL
YOU SHALL SPEAK THE TRUTH
UNDER THIS PRESSURE THE VALET TOLD ALL HE KNEW ABOUT HIS MASTER'S DEPARTURE WITH VERY LITTLE LOSS OF TIME BY REASON OF DISCURSIVENESS
THAT MARK UPON HENRY DUNBAR'S SHIRT WILL HANG HIS MURDERER THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME MISTAKE I SAID
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW ANXIOUSLY I USED TO LOOK FORWARD TO MY FATHER'S RETURN FROM INDIA AND HOW BITTERLY I FELT THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN I DISCOVERED LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER BE TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT OTHER FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN THE LONG BITTERNESS OF SEPARATION ARE TO EACH OTHER
I GAVE THE DRIVER OF THE HANSOM FIVE SHILLINGS
NOT A BIT OF IT SIR
AFTER THE WEDDING XXVI
IT WAS MR BALDERBY WHO HAD JUST COME FROM ST GUNDOLPH LANE WHERE HE HAD RECEIVED HENRY DUNBAR'S TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH
WHAT IS IT THEN MARGARET I CAN NEVER TELL YOU YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND NEVER SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN AIR OF QUIET RESOLUTION STAMPED UPON HER COLOURLESS FACE
THIS HORSE WAS A MAGNIFICENT CREATURE
YOU'LL CARRY A BLUE BAG
THE LANGUID FOOTMAN CAME IN ANSWER TO CLEMENT'S SUMMONS
I SUPPOSE YOU'D LIKE TO BE WITH ME TO THE END OF THIS BUSINESS
NEXT DOOR BUT TWO FROM MR LOVELL'S THE SOLICITOR'S AND NOT MORE THAN HALF-A-DOZEN YARDS FROM ST GWENDOLINE'S CHURCH MAJOR VERNON AS HE NOW CHOSE TO CALL HIMSELF WALKED FROM LISFORD TO SHORNCLIFFE
I WAS IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT MR CARTER HAD GATHERED FROM THE MAN'S TALK
HE GOT WHAT HE COULD OUT OF HIS FATHER TOWARDS PAYING HIS LOSSES BUT HE COULD NOT GET MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND POUNDS
AFTER CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION IT WAS SETTLED THAT LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING SHOULD TAKE PLACE UPON THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER
THERE WAS A POLITICAL PARTY SIR ROBERT SOMEBODY--BUT NOT SIR ROBERT PEEL--WHO SAID EVERY MAN HAS HIS PRICE NOW DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT MISS WILMOT WOULD TAKE A BRIBE AND HOLD HER TONGUE DO I THINK THAT SHE WOULD TAKE MONEY FROM THE MAN SHE SUSPECTED AS THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER--THE MAN SHE KNEW TO HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY OF HER FATHER
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU MARRIED TO MY DAUGHTER
LET THE CHASTISEMENT OF MAN FALL UPON HIM SO AS THOU WILT ACCEPT HIS REPENTANCE MARGARET SAID JOSEPH WILMOT GRASPING THE GIRL'S ARM ARE YOU PRAYING THAT I MAY BE HUNG
SHE IS RATHER A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL WITH VERY AUBURN PLAITS HANGING IN LOOPS AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
HE HAD THOUGHT THIS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT STRANGERS HAD BEEN BUSY ON THAT SPOT DRAGGING THE WATER--THE DREADFUL WATER THAT HAD SO OFTEN FLOWED THROUGH HIS DREAMS--WITH NOT ONE BUT A THOUSAND DEAD FACES LOOKING UP AND GRINNING AT HIM THROUGH THE STREAM--THE TIDINGS THAT A SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE THERE CAME UPON HIM LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
BUT STILL THEY ARE TO BE HAD IF YOU'VE A FANCY FOR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND MR DUNBAR SHOOK HIS HEAD
IS IT SO FATHER IT IS MARGARET
MARGARET HE SAID VERY GRAVELY PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN FOOLISH AND PRESUMPTUOUS IN THIS BUSINESS
AND SHALL I BE QUOTED AS THE PEPYS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
THREE OF THEM--VERY OLD FADED AND FLABBY--WERE DIRECTED TO JOSEPH WILMOT CARE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NORFOLK ISLAND IN A PRIM CLERK-LIKE HAND
AND I DID THINK OF HER AND PRAY FOR HER WITH AS FERVENT ASPIRATIONS AS EVER ROSE FROM A MAN'S FAITHFUL HEART
LET ME GET BACK AS FAST AS I MAY JOSEPH WILMOT WILL HAVE HAD EIGHT-AND-FORTY HOURS START OF ME HE THOUGHT
BUT I TOOK THE LADIES SINGLY AND CALLED UPON THEM IN THE PLEASANT SUMMER EVENINGS AFTER OFFICE HOURS SOMETIMES WITH MY MOTHER SOMETIMES ALONE
NO MR HUGH ANSWERED AS STERNLY AS BEFORE HE HAS NOTHING TO SAY FOR YOU
THE SMILE THAT TOOK NO RADIANCE FROM A LIGHT WITHIN
IF SO THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT THIS MAN'S CRIME SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
I WAS FRIGHTENED OF MY OWN FATHER
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT SHE HAS GONE THROUGH A MEETING WHICH WAS CERTAINLY CALCULATED TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE EFFECT UPON HER MIND
I ASKED WHO HAD COPIED THOSE SIGNATURES AND YOUR BROTHER CAME FORWARD AND OWNED TO HAVING DONE IT LAUGHING AT HIS OWN CLEVERNESS
THE CARRIAGE CAME ROUND TO THE GRAVEL-DRIVE BEFORE THE PORCH AT THE APPOINTED MOMENT
HE LOOKS A BAD UN THE DETECTIVE MUTTERED AS HE WALKED AWAY
THE MAJOR'S EYES WERE ALMOST DAZZLED BY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THAT PLEASANT CHAMBER
MY DEAREST CLEM,--_I WAS VERY GLAD TO GET YOUR LETTER THIS MORNING ANNOUNCING YOUR SAFE ARRIVAL AT WINCHESTER
I TOLD HIM THE STORY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH MARGARET VERY BRIEFLY GIVING HIM ONLY THE NECESSARY DETAILS
THEN HIS WHOLE FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY A CONVULSIVE TREMBLING AND HIS TEETH CHATTERED VIOLENTLY
I BELIEVE HE TRIED TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING BUT COULDN'T
THE PAST IS A BOND OF UNION BETWIXT US LAURA
THESE COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS INQUISITIVE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE POURED OUT A GLASS OF BRANDY DRANK IT AND THEN DREW ONE OF THE CANDLES TOWARDS HIM
THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NOT LONG COME IN AND THAT THE DRIVER WAS SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE STABLES
I REMEMBER HIM
IT'S HIM HE MUTTERED
THE DREADFUL GRIEF WHICH HAD SO LONG BROODED DARKLY OVER HIS LIFE HAD COME DOWN UPON HIM AT LAST AND THE PANG HAD NOT BEEN SO INSUPPORTABLE AS HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE
A LAD WHO WAS FISHING IN ONE OF THE MEADOWS NEAR THE GROVE WENT WITH US TO SHOW US THE EXACT SPOT
IF HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN SOME MISERABLE STARVING CREATURE WHO IN A FIT OF MAD FURY AGAINST THE INEQUALITIES OF LIFE HAD LIFTED HIS GAUNT ARM TO SLAY HIS PROSPEROUS BROTHER FOR THE SAKE OF BREAD--DETECTIVES WOULD HAVE DOGGED HIS SNEAKING STEPS AND WATCHED HIS GUILTY FACE AND HOVERED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM TILL THEY TRACKED HIM TO HIS DOOM
THE SLOPING ROOFS THE GABLE-ENDS THE QUEER OLD CHIMNEYS THE QUAINT CASEMENT WINDOWS BELONG TO A BYGONE AGE
WILL YOU ASK THE LANDLORD TO COME TO ME MR DUNBAR WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT WHILE THE WAITER WAS GONE UPON THIS ERRAND
ACCIDENT BROUGHT ME INTO THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AT THE VERY HOUR YOU WERE COMING INTO THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
HE HAD RATHER AN UNDECIDED MANNER AND WALKED ONCE OR TWICE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM STOPPING NOW AND THEN AND THEN WALKING ON AGAIN IN AN UNSETTLED WAY
I HAVE NO PITY HE ANSWERED STERNLY
THE EMPTY POCKET-BOOK WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND A FEW PACES FROM THE BODY WAS PRODUCED
EARLY UPON THE MORNING AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL IN LONDON HENRY DUNBAR AND THE YOUNG LAWYER BREAKFASTED TOGETHER IN THEIR SITTING-ROOM AT THE HOTEL
A MAN WHO BEGAN LIFE WITH AN HONEST NAME AND FAIR PROSPECTS BEFORE HIM FINDS HIMSELF CAST BY ONE FATAL ERROR DISGRACED AND BROKEN ON A PITILESS WORLD
NO,--NO CRIED SAMPSON WILMOT AS HIS BROTHER STEPPED AFTER HIM INTO THE CARRIAGE
THE FUNNY MAN BREAKS DOWN IN THE CLIMACTIC VERSE OF HIS GREAT BUFFO SONG
THE HOUSEMAID AT WOODBINE COTTAGE XLIII
A COAT WAISTCOAT AND SHIRT
I AM QUITE SURE FATHER NOTHING CAN TEAR YOUR HEART FROM ME NOTHING IN THIS WORLD WHAT IF I AM NOT WORTHY OF YOUR LOVE I CANNOT STOP TO THINK OF THAT FATHER
AND THEN STAGGERED HEAVILY TO HIS FEET
PEOPLE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO HIS STRANGE MANNERS AND WERE VERY INDULGENT TOWARDS HIS FOIBLES
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE'S EVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE A MYSTERY BETWEEN YOU AND ME IT IS MOTHER
I HAD SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF MARGARET'S CONDUCT AND AT THE SAME TIME HAD SET A BARRIER BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE WOMAN I LOVED
THE LANGUID YOUTH LIFTED HIS NOSE WHICH BY ITS NATURAL CONFORMATION BETRAYED AN ASPIRING CHARACTER AND LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS CUSTOMER
BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COME HERE AND TO TAKE THIS INTEREST IN MY FATHER
TRY TO HURRY THE WORK OF NATURE AND YOU'LL HAVE CAUSE TO REPENT YOUR IMPATIENCE FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR LIFE SO HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THE DECREES OF FATE AND TO LIE DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT UPON HIS BED IN THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER STARING AT THE FIRE OR THE FIGURE OF HIS VALET AND ATTENDANT
THE WAITER WAS MOVING SOFTLY ABOUT THE ROOM
BUT A STRAY OLD WOMAN HOVERING UNDER THE ARCHWAY INFORMED PHILIP JOCELYN THAT MR KERSTALL WAS TO BE FOUND ON THE SECOND STORY
I DON'T SUPPOSE HE LISTENS TO THE PRAYERS OF SUCH AS ME
FATHER I KNEW THEY COULD HAVE ONLY ONE PURPOSE IN COMING TO THAT PLACE
I HOPE YOUR CELLAR ISN'T COLD OH NO SIR
TO THIS HORSE HENRY DUNBAR BECAME SINGULARLY ATTACHED
STUDIES FROM THE LIFE GREY AND CHALKY AND MUSCULAR WITH HERE AND THERE A KNOTTY-LOOKING FOOT OR A LUMPY ARM IN THE MOST UNPLEASANT PHASES OF FORESHORTENING
I WILL THANK YOU TO TELL HER THAT LOVELL
OH YEA I REMEMBER
SHE SMILED TENDERLY AS SHE REMEMBERED HIS BRIGHT BOYHOOD
BUT PRESENTLY HE THREW IT DOWN IMPATIENTLY AND TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT-POCKET
IF IT WERE NOT THAT I LIVE IN PERPETUAL TERROR OF THE DAY WHEN THE DILETTANTE NEW ZEALANDER WILL EDIT THIS MANUSCRIPT I THINK I SHOULD WRITE THAT LOVELY NAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR A PAGE OR SO
THE VERGER WHO WAS ELDERLY AND SLOW CALLED AFTER THEM IN A FEEBLE VOICE AS THEY WENT AWAY
YOU ARE COMFORTABLE IN YOUR POSITION AND YET YOU--OH
TELL ME THAT MAN'S NAME WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HIS NAME MADGE NEVER MIND WHY FATHER
FOUR ABREAST AND THREE BEHIND
IT WANTED FIVE MINUTES TO FOUR WHEN MR DUNBAR AND HIS COMPANION ENTERED THE HANDSOME HALL OF THE GEORGE
I'VE HALF A MIND TO GO ON BOARD AND OVERHAUL HER CHAPTER XLIV
AND THE POOR WRETCH WHO HAD HELPED HIM--THE CLEVER BRIGHT-FACED HIGH-SPIRITED LAD WHO HAD ACTED AS HIS TOOL AND ACCOMPLICE--WAS AS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN AS IF HE HAD NEVER EXISTED
WHAT WAS THAT YOUR MASTER SAID TO YOU IN THE PARLOUR JUST NOW EH
AND I THINK THE RENOWNED PEPYS HIMSELF WAS ONLY A BACHELOR SPOILED
I HAVE NO BETTER ENGAGEMENT NOR HAVE I EVEN A PROSPECT OF ANY ENGAGEMENT YOU HAVEN'T EXCLAIMED THE JUNIOR PARTNER
AMONG THE MEN WHO WERE READY TO LAY AGAINST ANYTHING AND WERE MOST UNPLEASANTLY VOCIFEROUS IN THE DECLARATION OF THEIR READINESS THERE WAS ONE MAN WHO WAS WELL KNOWN TO THE HUMBLER CLASS OF BOOKMEN WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATED WHO WAS KNOWN TO SPECULATE UPON VERY SMALL CAPITAL BUT WHO HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN AS A DEFAULTER
I HAVE NEVER READ IT SINCE I WAS A BOY AND USED TO READ LONG CHAPTERS ALOUD TO MY MOTHER ON QUIET SUNDAY EVENINGS
ONCE WHILE STANDING IN THE PROW OF THE BOAT WITH HIS FACE TURNED STEADILY TOWARDS THAT SPECK IN THE HORIZON MR CARTER THRUST HIS HAND INTO THE BREAST-POCKET OF HIS COAT WHERE THERE LURKED THE NEWEST AND NEATEST THING IN REVOLVERS
IT'S BUSINESS AND I'M READY TO DO ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS
SHE WALKED QUIETLY AWAY AND WENT ONCE MORE TO THE HOUSE OF SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE
HE WENT INTO THE PASSAGE BETWEEN MR BALDERBY'S PARLOUR AND THE PUBLIC OFFICES OF THE BANK
BUT BELIEVE THIS FATHER,--ALWAYS BELIEVE THIS,--THAT WHETHER YOU TRUST ME OR NOT THERE IS NOTHING UPON THIS EARTH STRONG ENOUGH TO TURN MY HEART FROM YOU SHE PLACED HER HAND IN HER FATHER'S AS SHE SPOKE AND HE GRASPED IT SO TIGHTLY THAT HER PALE FACE GREW CRIMSON WITH THE PAIN
BUT I WILL FORGET THE BLOT UPON THE PAST AND HELP YOU TO ACHIEVE REDEMPTION IN THE FUTURE IF MY FATHER HAD MET SUCH A FRIEND SUCH A BENEFACTOR ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT THEN MARGARET WILMOT RELATED THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LAST CONVERSATION BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER FATHER
YOU STOP HERE AND PICK UP WHAT YOU CAN
THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN ROLLED UP VERY TIGHTLY AND THE OUTER GARMENT WAS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE RATS
HER FATHER HAD BEEN MURDERED BY HIS OLD MASTER
I WANT TO SEE HIM
I WANT TO SEE HIM
WHAT SHOULD HENRY DUNBAR WANT WITH JOSEPH WILMOT'S WATCH AND CHAIN AH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ANSWERED MR CARTER
BEING ONLY A CASHIER IN A BANK I CAN DO NOTHING BUT ENSHRINE HER IN THE COMMONPLACE PAGES OF MY DIARY
AN EARNESTNESS AND STEADINESS OF TONE WHICH EXPRESSED MORE DETERMINATION THAN ANY NOISY OR PASSIONATE UTTERANCE COULD HAVE DONE
ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES
WE SHALL BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SORT OF A MAN OUR NEW CHIEF IS TO BE SURE SIR TO BE SURE RETURNED THE OLD CLERK
SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM ON ACCOUNT OF SOME MONEY ARRANGEMENTS OF HER DEAD HUSBAND'S WHO HAD ALWAYS BANKED WITH DUNBAR AND DUNBAR
AND HIS OLD MASTER MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL HIS UNEASINESS
A MURDER THAT HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE SAKE OF THE VICTIM'S LITTLE PROPERTY
NOW YOU CAN COME WITH ME HE WALKED INTO A WAITING-ROOM THE HALF-GLASS DOORS OF WHICH OPENED OUT OF THE OFFICE
MRS GRUMBLETON GAVE CLEMENT ALL THE INFORMATION HE REQUIRED AS TO THE BANKER'S DAILY MOVEMENTS AT THE PRESENT TIME
AND IF IT WAS AGREEABLE WE COULD DRIVE YOU OVER IN A FOUR-WHEEL SHAY
WHAT HAPPENED AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY XXXIII
HE WAS LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM AND REMEMBERING THE DAY UPON WHICH HE HAD LAST SEEN IT
MR CARTER LOOKED AT THE JEWELLERS TILL HE CAME TO ONE WHOSE PROPRIETOR BLENDED THE TRADE OF MONEY-LENDING WITH HIS MORE ARISTOCRATIC COMMERCE
THAT FIRST IMPRESSION WAS NOT A GOOD ONE--NO IT WAS NOT A GOOD ONE
ON NO ACCOUNT
OH IF I DARED--IF I COULD VENTURE--I MUST SPEAK LAURA DUNBAR
THE TRAIN WAS NOT DUE UNTIL A QUARTER PAST
MY BROTHER IS IN A FIT JOSEPH CRIED
I SHALL TAKE CARE TO HAVE YOUR STATEMENT PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE DETECTIVE OFFICER WHO IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THIS AFFAIR
AND WAS RATHER AT A LOSS FOR SMALL-TALK WHEN HE FOUND HIS FEMININE NEIGHBOUR AT A DINNER-TABLE WAS DEEPLY DARKLY BEAUTIFULLY BLUE BUT THE YOUNG BARONET WAS BY NO MEANS A FOOL NOTWITHSTANDING THESE SPORTSMANLIKE PROCLIVITIES
IN PLAIN ENGLISH THE TWO THOU WHICH YOU SO LIBERALLY ADVANCED AS THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF FUTURE BOUNTIES HAS MELTED LIKE SNOW IN A RAPID THAW
BUT THE INDIAN SERVANT THAT BROUGHT YOU OVER WHEN YOU WAS BUT A BIT OF A BABY SAID THAT YOUR PA WAS PROUD AND PASSIONATE
BUT WHO SET THE MARK UPON YOU
BUT WHATEVER THE TRUTH OF THAT AWFUL STORY MIGHT BE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THREW ANY LIGHT UPON THE MYSTERY
BUT THE LADY WHOM I HOPE TO CALL MY WIFE IS POOR AND I HAVE EVERY NECESSITY TO BE A WORKING MAN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE WELL THEN MY DEAR FELLOW IT'S A RIDDLE
IF YOU WANT ME TO BE OF USE TO YOU TRUST ME THOROUGHLY
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO SIR PHILIP AND WAITED TO HEAR WHAT THAT GENTLEMAN REQUIRED OF HIM
BRING ME PEN INK AND PAPER HE SAID
I LOVE MY WIFE'S PLAYING BEST THOUGH THEY ARE KIND ENOUGH TO PERFORM TWENTY-PAGE COMPOSITIONS BY BACH AND MENDELSSOHN FOR MY AMUSEMENT
HENRY DUNBAR ARTHUR LOVELL AND MR BALDERBY WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL
WHAT A DUPE HE HAD BEEN
AND AMONG THEM THEY'D CONTRIVE TO MUDDLE THE CLEAREST HEAD THAT EVER WORKED A DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN CRIMINAL EUCLID
BUT REMEMBER WHATEVER I GIVE IS CONTINGENT UPON HER OWN GOOD CONDUCT AND MUST NOT IN ANY WAY BE TAKEN AS A BRIBE
I UNDERSTOOD HER AGITATION AT HEARING OF MY JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER
WE WERE ON EXCELLENT TERMS
BUT TO ME IT SEEMS A GREAT DEAL MORE LIKE FEAR CHAPTER XVII
BUT EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE OARS STOUTLY PLIED BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN THEY GAINED NO WAY UPON THE CROW FOR THE BLACK SPECK GREW FAINTER AND FAINTER UPON THE HORIZON-LINE AND AT LAST DROPPED DOWN BEHIND IT ALTOGETHER
IT'S COMFORTABLE SAID MAJOR VERNON
INDEED TO BE ROLLED UP IN A RAILWAY RUG IN THE CORNER OF A SECOND-CLASS CARRIAGE WAS TO BE ON A BED OF DOWN AS COMPARED WITH SOME OF HIS EXPERIENCES
AND THE CASHIER HAD ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE GATE AND HAD SOMETIMES LINGERED WITH HER THERE IN THE DUSK PROLONGING SOME CONVERSATION THAT HAD BEEN BEGUN IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
YOU'LL COME AND SEE HIM YES I SHALL BE VERY GLAD
YOU'RE RIGHT MADGE HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU'RE RIGHT MY GIRL
WE ANGLO-INDIANS HAVE RATHER A MAGNIFICENT WAY OF DOING THINGS MR BALDERBY HE CONTINUED WHEN WE TAKE IT INTO OUR HEADS TO DO THEM AT ALL
AND I AM FAIN TO CONFESS THAT UPON THIS OCCASION MRS MADDEN TALKED RATHER MORE FOR THE SAKE OF TALKING THAN FROM ANY OVERFLOW OF ANIMAL SPIRITS
INSIDE THIS FUR COLLAR THE MAJOR WORE A SHAWL-PATTERNED SCARF OF ALL THE COLOURS IN THE PRISMATIC SCALE ACROSS WHICH HIS NOSE LACKED ITS USUAL BRILLIANCY OF HUE BY FORCE OF CONTRAST
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE VERGER NOW WITH A QUIET STEADY GAZE WHICH SEEMED THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO FEAR AND WHO WAS SERENE AND UNDISTURBED BY REASON OF HIS INNOCENCE
FOR IN SOUL AS WELL AS IN ASPECT SHE WAS WORTHY TO BE A QUEEN
FACING THE GAZE OF THE CORONER AND THE JURYMEN
BY-AND-BY MR DUNBAR GOT UP TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR
I HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSURE OUR BEING UNDISTURBED SO LONG AS YOU MAY REMAIN HERE
AND THE REWARD I PROMISED SHALL BE FAITHFULLY PAID TO YOU
HE WAS A COARSE-FEATURED SUNBURNT RUFFIANLY-LOOKING FELLOW
DO YOU KNOW ME SO LITTLE AS TO THINK THAT I WILL PART WITH YOU
SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE WERE EXAMINED I SUPPOSE SAID MR CARTER
CERTAINLY
BUT P'RAPS IF YOU WAS TO MAKE A HOFFER PREVIOUS TO THE SALE THE PROPERTY MIGHT BE DISPOSED OF AS IT STANDS BY PRIVATE CONTRACK I'LL SEE ABOUT THAT ANSWERED MAJOR VERNON
WHEN MR DUNBAR HAS SEEN MORE OF YOU WHEN HE HAS BECOME BETTER ACCUSTOMED TO YOUR SOCIETY THAT HE WILL NEVER BE LAURA ANSWERED IMPETUOUSLY
BUT WITH THE THOUGHT OF WHAT DISHONEST WORK HE MIGHT BE ENGAGED IN DURING HIS ABSENCE
YOU WISH TO KNOW THE FATE OF THIS PORTRAIT OF MR DUNBAR I THINK YOU SAID LAURA ANSWERED THIS QUESTION ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO HER HUSBAND
I HAVE A GOOD MANY ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE AND SHALL BE LATE WILL YOU REQUIRE ASSISTANCE SIR NO
I ASKED
BUT LOR SIR WITHOUT UNFRIENDLINESS TO WILLIAM BRIGMAWL WHICH ME AND BRIGMAWL HAVE BEEN FELLOW-SERVANTS THESE ELEVEN YEAR OUR HEAD-WAITER IS THAT WRAPPED UP IN HISSELF AND HIS OWN CRAVATS AND SHIRT-FRONTS AND GOLD STUDS AND ALBERT CHAIN THAT HE'D SCARCELY TAKE NOTICE OF AN EARTHQUAKE SWALLERING UP HALF THE WORLD BEFORE HIS EYES UNLESS THE MUCK AND DIRT OF THAT EARTHQUAKE WAS TO SPOIL HIS CLOTHES
SHE HAD ARRIVED ONLY FIVE MINUTES AFTER MR DUNBAR ENTERED THE BANKING-HOUSE AND SHE WAITED VERY PATIENTLY VERY RESOLUTELY IN THE HOPE THAT WHEN HENRY DUNBAR RETURNED TO HIS CARRIAGE SHE MIGHT SNATCH THE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HIM OF SEEING HIS FACE AND DISCOVERING WHETHER HE WAS GUILTY OR NOT
HE HAD SEEN DEATH UNDER MANY OF ITS WORST ASPECTS AND THE GRIM KING OF TERRORS HAD LITTLE TERROR FOR HIM
WITH POLITENESS
YOU'VE GOT THOSE LETTERS TO WRITE BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK EH MR AUSTIN SAID THE DETECTIVE AS THE WAITER RE-ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A DECANTER ON A SILVER SALVER
BUT FOR FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS I'VE NEVER HAD A LINE FROM HIM
ARE YOU GOING OUT FATHER THE GIRL ASKED
I'VE HEARD MY GRANDFATHER SAY SO
JOSEPH WILMOT STOPPED SUDDENLY UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE NEAR WHICH MR DUNBAR SAT AND LAYING HIS HAND UPON IT SAID QUIETLY YOU ASKED ME JUST NOW WHO I WAS MR DUNBAR THE BANKER LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE
FOR HIS PRESENCE WAS ALWAYS AGREEABLE TO THE IMPETUOUS GIRL
BUT OH CLEMENT WHEN I SAW THE ALTERATION IN THAT UNHAPPY GIRL MY HEART MELTED ALL AT ONCE AND I COULD NOT SPEAK TO HER COLDLY OR UNKINDLY
I KNOW THAT NEITHER CLEMENT NOR THE MAN THAT WAS WITH HIM LEFT WINCHESTER BY THE TRAIN THAT TOOK ME TO LONDON
HENRY DUNBAR SHUT THE DOOR AND WALKED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
ON THE OTHER HAND SOMETHING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM
THE BARONET AND HIS WIFE THANKED THE ARTIST VERY WARMLY FOR HIS POLITENESS AND PHILIP GAVE HIM A COMMISSION FOR A REPLICA OF THE PICTURE WHICH LAURA HAD ADMIRED IN THE LUXEMBOURG
YOU HAVE KNOWN MY DAUGHTER FOR A LONG TIME I UNDERSTAND BY HER LETTERS YES
BUT I CAN PROCURE THEM FOR YOU IN A DAY OR TWO IF THAT WILL DO THAT WILL DO VERY WELL
THERE WERE DARK PURPLE RINGS ABOUT HIS EYES
BUT THE DASHING YOUNG OFFICER WAS COMPELLED TO SELL HIS COMMISSION AND BEGIN LIFE AFRESH AS A JUNIOR CLERK IN THE CALCUTTA BANKING-HOUSE
HE'D LIKED ME TO HAVE PAINTED HIM LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW OF HIS STATE-COACH SIR BOWING TO THE POPULACE ON LUDGATE HILL WITH THE DOME OF ST PAUL'S IN THE BACKGROUND
NO I ANSWERED RESOLUTELY
AND HE HAD BELIEVED IT EVER SINCE THAT DAY UPON WHICH THE BANKER STOLE LIKE A DETECTED THIEF OUT OF THE HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
BUT ONLY AS SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED HIM HAD HE BEEN INDEED HER BROTHER
DON'T SPEAK TO ME CLEMENT AUSTIN SHE CRIED
SHE WAS INCOHERENT IN HER EXCITEMENT AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS SO AND STRUGGLED TO EXPRESS HERSELF CLEARLY
THIS IS HIS HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF MANY OTHER MEN LIKE HIM AND MARGARET WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THIS MAN
SO NOW THERE WERE THREE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED MR DUNBAR TO BE THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT
I AM SO FEEBLE SO MISERABLY WEAK AND FEEBLE AND I WANT TO BE STRONG
HIS TROUSERS HAD TO BE CUT AWAY FROM HIS BROKEN LEG BEFORE ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
HE WAS SO WELL SATISFIED WITH THE LOOK OF SIR PHILIP JOCELYN AND THE CHESTNUT MARE GUINEVERE THAT HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LAYING THE ODDS AGAINST ALL THE OTHER HORSES AND ALLOWED THE BARONET AND THE CHESTNUT TO RUN FOR HIM
THIS IS THE COURSE THAT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD PLANNED FOR HIMSELF
A NEW LIFE
LET EVERY INCH OF GROUND BETWEEN THIS AND THE FERNS BE SEARCHED AT DAYBREAK TO-MORROW MORNING
THE DINNER-TABLE WAS CLEARED BY-AND-BY AND MRS AUSTIN PRODUCED SOME COLOURED WOOLS AND A PAIR OF IVORY KNITTING-NEEDLES AND SET TO WORK VERY QUIETLY BY THE LIGHT OF THE TALL WAX-CANDLES
THEY MEAN WELL YOU KNOW AND THEY LOOK UPON ME AS PUBLIC PROPERTY
I ONLY WANT YOUR LOVE
I SHOULD SCARCELY THINK IT LIKELY HE WOULD EVER BE CALLED UPON TO ATONE FOR THEM I DON'T KNOW SIR THE OLD CLERK ANSWERED
YOU'VE GIVEN ME A FINE CHASE FOR IT
I WAS SO HARASSED AND TORMENTED BY MY OWN POSITION THAT I COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO GET MYSELF DEEPER INTO THE MIRE BY INTERCEDING FOR YOU
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT A MAN THAT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO YOU BY THOSE WHO KNOW HIM TRUST HIM AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRUST HIM DON'T CONFIDE IN HIM BY HALVES
NOW SAID MR CARTER WE'LL EXAMINE THE BUNDLE HE PUSHED AWAY THE DINNER-TABLE AND DREW FORWARD A SMALLER TABLE
AT LAST HE ASKED THE LAD ONE DAY IF HE'D LIKE TO LEAVE THE BANK AND GO AND LIVE WITH HIM AS A SORT OF CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT AND AMANUENSIS TO WRITE HIS LETTERS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
THERE WAS A SPACIOUS BED-CHAMBER A COMFORTABLE STUDY A DRESSING-ROOM BATH-ROOM AND ANTECHAMBER
AND IT HAS GROWN AND STRENGTHENED IN MY HEART EVER SINCE THAT SUMMER EVENING UNTIL IT LEADS ME HERE TO-NIGHT TO TELL YOU ALL AND TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANY HOPE
SHE WAS VERY MEDITATIVE ABOUT SOMETHING
THE LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN UP TO A PRIVATE ROOM AND THE TWO MEN WALKED AWAY FROM THE HOTEL ARM-IN-ARM
HIS GENEROUS YOUNG HEART WHICH HAD YEARNED TOWARDS LAURA'S FATHER HAD SUNK IN HIS BREAST WITH A DULL CHILL FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE RICH MAN
LOOKED DOWN ALBEMARLE STREET
IT HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THE DISCOVERY TO WHICH MARGARET WILMOT'S LETTER WAS THE FIRST INDICATION--THE DISCOVERY POINTED TO BY EVERY WORD THAT MAN TOLD US LAST NIGHT
WHAT AM I TO DO HE SAID
I THOUGHT THAT WILMOT MIGHT RETURN FROM THE FERNS IN TIME TO GO OVER SOME PORTION OF THE EDIFICE WITH ME
SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER OLD FAVOURITE ARTHUR LOVELL AND SET HERSELF TO WORK TO EXPEDITE THAT MOST IMPORTANT MATTER OF THE WEDDING-GARMENTS
MRS MADDEN WAS SUPERSTITIOUS AS MOST IGNORANT AND SIMPLE-MINDED PEOPLE GENERALLY ARE MORE OR LESS
THERE'S ONLY A FOOTPATH ACROSS THE MEADOWS
IT SURPRISED ME WHEN THE DETECTIVE TALKED OF HIS GUILT AS OPEN TO QUESTION AND YET TO BE PROVED
HE WAS A TRUE JOCELYN--IMPETUOUS MAD-HEADED DARING
THESE ARE SOMEBODY'S CLOTHES SURE ENOUGH THE DETECTIVE SAID
THE DOCTOR DID ALL THAT HIS SKILL COULD DEVISE BUT HE COULD NOT RESTORE CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE PARALYZED BRAIN
UP TO THE TIME OF MARGARET'S APPEARANCE ON THAT BLEAK WINTER'S NIGHT I HAD CHERISHED THE HOPE--OR EVEN MORE THAN HOPE--THE BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD BE REUNITED
AND HOW HE EVER MANAGED TO GET OUT AND ABOUT AND SADDLE HIS HORSE AND RIDE AWAY LIKE THAT WITHOUT BEIN EVER HEARD BY A CREETUR NOBODY HASN'T THE SLIGHTEST NOTION
IT WAS DIRECTED IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND THE ENVELOPE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DEEP BORDER OF BLACK
THERE IS MY HAND UPON IT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AS HE SPOKE AND ARTHUR LOVELL TOOK IT A LITTLE RELUCTANTLY PERHAPS BUT WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS HE COULD
MY FATHER HAS COME SHE EXCLAIMED
BUT BEYOND THIS ACTION WHICH WAS ALMOST INVOLUNTARY HE MADE NO SIGN THAT HE WAS THINKING OF THE DANGER BEFORE HIM
PARDON ME MR DUNBAR SAID THE YOUNG LAWYER
GOOD NIGHT MISS WILMOT GOOD NIGHT MARGARET OPENED THE GATE AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN
THE CLOTHES MARKED WITH THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR MAY NOT HAVE REALLY BELONGED TO HENRY DUNBAR
FOR I BELIEVE YOU LOVE HER VERY SINCERELY
THE BANKER'S MANNER CONVINCED YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE THEN I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR MURDERED MY--MY UNHAPPY FATHER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE TONE OF ANGUISH WITH WHICH MARGARET SPOKE THOSE LAST THREE WORDS
HER FACE I DID NOT SEE AT ALL
WAS SHE NOT AN HEIRESS AND THEREFORE SPECIALLY SENT INTO THE WORLD TO GIVE HAPPINESS TO PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN BORN WITHOUT THAT PLEASANT APPENDAGE OF A SILVER SPOON IN THEIR INFANTINE MOUTHS
YOU WHO HAVE LIFTED THE SILVER VEIL OF IMAGINATION TO SHOW ME THE HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF REALITY
SO I GO AWAY AT LAST HALF HEART-BROKEN
DO YOU KNOW IF THIS IS THE FIRST STROKE HE HAS EVER HAD NO I DO NOT THE SURGEON LOOKED MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN EVER AFTER RECEIVING THIS ANSWER
IT WAS MIDSUMMER TIME AND THE COUNTING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE AND THE PARLOUR IN WHICH--IN VIRTUE OF MY NEW POSITION--I HAD NOW A RIGHT TO WORK SEEMED PECULIARLY HOT AND FROWSY DUSTY AND OBNOXIOUS
AND SHE IS HAPPY WITH HER CHILDREN AND HER HUSBAND IN THE GRAND OLD HOME THAT WAS SO LONG OVERSHADOWED BY THE SINISTER PRESENCE OF THE FALSE HENRY DUNBAR
HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
NO CLOTHES AT ALL RESEMBLING THOSE THAT HAD BEEN SEEN UPON THE PERSON OF THE DEAD MAN HAD BEEN PLEDGED WITHIN FORTY MILES OF THE CATHEDRAL CITY
AND THEN RANG THE BELL
WHAT WAS THAT HE TOLD YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT EH BETTY SHOOK HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO TWIST THE CORNER OF HER APRON IN HER HANDS
THE SHADOWS OF THE QUEER OLD GABLED ROOFS WERE SHARPLY DEFINED UPON THE MOONLIT PAVEMENT
IN THAT CASE SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO PRESENT HERSELF AT THE FRONT DOOR CERTAINLY
SHE MADE A SORT OF PRETENCE AT EATING JUST TO PLEASE HER OLD NURSE WHO FIDGETED ABOUT THE ROOM
SEE DEAR BOY IT'S ALREADY NEARLY TWELVE O'CLOCK YES IF YOU WISH IT MOTHER I'LL GO TO MY ROOM MR AUSTIN ANSWERED QUICKLY
HE DID NOT TELL YOU THEN OH NO
THEN HE WENT BACK TO THE FIREPLACE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR AND GAVE A LONG GROAN
SHE HAD BEEN DRAWING
AND YET THIS WAS SCARCELY STRANGE
HE RARELY SPENT AS MUCH AS THAT
I PSHAW MR LOVELL
HE CAME BACK TO ENGLAND AND WAS SEEN ABOUT LONDON AND WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING CONCERNED IN ALL MANNER OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES FROM CARD-SHARPING TO COINING BUT NOTHING WAS EVER BROUGHT HOME TO HIM
THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ANY ANSWER PERHAPS FOR THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM HAD TO CATCH AN APPOINTED TRAIN AT SHORNCLIFFE STATION WHICH WAS TO TAKE THEM ON THE FIRST STAGE OF THEIR CONTINENTAL JOURNEY
AND MAY HEAVEN FORGIVE YOU DO YOU FORGIVE ME MR AUSTIN NOT YET
THIS WAS ALL CLEMENT AUSTIN WANTED TO KNOW
I WENT INTO THE LITTLE TOWN OF WANDSWORTH THE QUEER OLD-FASHIONED HIGH STREET THE DEAR OLD STREET WHICH SEEMS TO ME LIKE A TOWN IN A DUTCH PICTURE WHERE ALL THE TINTS ARE OF A SOMBRE BROWN YET IN WHICH THERE IS NEVERTHELESS SO MUCH LIGHT AND WARMTH
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PLAY-OR-PAY BETS ARE LAURA DEAR
THE GLORIOUS EXOTIC FLOWER MAY BE WANTING BUT THE STRONG ROOT LIES DEEPLY HIDDEN IN THE HEART
IT WAS A STREET WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH A VIEW TO ACHIEVING THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF INCONVENIENCE OUT OF A MINIMUM OF MATERIALS
YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT I AM A STRANGER IN ENGLAND
AT THREE O'CLOCK THE SAME DAY MR DUNBAR LEFT LONDON FOR MAUDESLEY ABBEY ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DAUGHTER DORA MACMAHON AND ARTHUR LOVELL
AND THEN WENT TO PLAY HIS PART IN THE GRAND BUSINESS OF THE DAY
MR BALDERBY WAS EXAMINED AND SWORE TO THE SPLENDID POSITION WHICH HENRY DUNBAR OCCUPIED AS CHIEF OF THE HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
MR DUNBAR WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS DREW BACK THE GREEN-CLOTH CURTAIN UNBARRED THE HEAVY SHUTTERS AND LET THE GREY MORNING LIGHT INTO THE ROOM
I KNOW HOW TENDER AND TRUE A FRIEND SHE HAS IN YOU
BE SO GOOD AS TO SEE THAT IT IS SENT OFF IMMEDIATELY BY THE SPEEDIEST ROUTE
HE ORDERED A BOTTLE OF SODA-WATER SANK INTO AN EASY-CHAIR AND TOOK UP THE TIMES NEWSPAPER
AH!--HUMPH
ELIZABETH MADDEN WAS WAITING IN THE BRIDE'S DRESSING-ROOM WITH LADY JOCELYN'S TRAVELLING-DRESS LAID IN STATE UPON A BIG SOFA
PRODUCED BY JONATHAN INGRAM AND DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADERS HENRY DUNBAR A NOVEL BY M.E
BUT THAT DISAGREEABLE ELIZABETH WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO GO TO ANY ONE OF THOSE ENTERTAINMENTS
MORE DEARLY THAN HE HAD EVER BEFORE LOVED ANY HUMAN CREATURE
MY POOR FATHER--MY POOR WRONGED UNHAPPY FATHER!--YES WRONGED CLEMENT YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT
BUT YOU ASKED ME WHAT I SAW SIR AND I HAVE TOLD YOU CANDID AND MY GOOD FELLOW YOU'RE PERFECTLY SAFE IN TALKING TO ME THE DETECTIVE ANSWERED HEARTILY
AND AS TO POOR MADGE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A GREAT TREAT TO HER TO GET AWAY FROM HER PUPILS AND HAVE A PEEP AT THE GENUINE COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH THERE ISN'T A SINGLE LEAF UPON THE TREES
THEN I AM TO PUT MYSELF OUT OF THE WAY--AFTER BEING FAGGED AND HARASSED TO DEATH ALREADY ABOUT THIS BUSINESS--AND AM TO SEE EVERY ADVENTURESS WHO CHOOSES TO TRADE UPON THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN IN ORDER TO STOP THE MOUTHS OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF WINCHESTER
THE BANKER LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WITH A FORCED SMILE UPON HIS FACE THAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A NERVOUS CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES ABOUT THE LIPS
THERE IS ONLY ONE CONDITION UPON WHICH I WILL LET YOU GO THIS DAY WHAT IS THAT CONDITION TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN FOOLED BY MY OWN EGOTISM
IT WAS BY NO MEANS WONDERFUL THEN THAT AFTER BECOMING POSSESSOR OF THE UNITED FORTUNES OF HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE HENRY DUNBAR SHOULD KEEP ALOOF FROM A PLACE THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN OBNOXIOUS TO HIM
ARRESTED
I WANTED MR CARTER'S HELP
AND HAVE BREAKFASTED TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE WHICH THE BREAKFAST EKEWPAGE HAVE NOT YET BEEN REMOVED SO MUCH THE BETTER MAJOR VERNON ANSWERED COOLLY
THEY KNEW THAT AS A YOUNG MAN HENRY DUNBAR HAD CONTRACTED THE TASTES AND HABITS OF AN ARISTOCRAT AND THAT IF HE HAD AFTERWARDS DEVELOPED INTO A CLEVER AND SUCCESSFUL MAN OF BUSINESS IT WAS ONLY BY REASON OF THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAD THRUST HIM INTO A POSITION THAT HE HATED
I RAN ALL THE WAY TO WINCHESTER TO THE STATION--I WAS IN TIME FOR A TRAIN WHICH BROUGHT ME TO LONDON--I CAME ON BY THE MAIL TO RUGBY--AND YES YES
BUT SHE LOVED HER BETROTHED HUSBAND TOO DEARLY TO BE BRAVE ON THIS
SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN RATHER REMISS IN HER DUTIES AS DUENNA AND WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF
MORE THAN THIS HE HAD EVERY CHANCE OF BEING ADMITTED ERE LONG TO A JUNIOR PARTNERSHIP UPON VERY EASY TERMS WHICH JUNIOR PARTNERSHIP WOULD OF COURSE BE THE HIGH-ROAD TO A GREAT FORTUNE
HE TOUCHED THE RAGGED AND MUD-STAINED BUNDLE AS CAREFULLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN SOME LIVING THING
HE MADE VERY LIGHT OF A BRACE OF PARTRIDGES AND A BOTTLE OF SPARKLING MOSELLE
A COUPLE OF AYAHS
AND AFTER ALL WHAT UNDER HEAVEN IS STRONGER THAN LOVE
HE IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I MAKE A COMPANION OF HIM
MR DUNBAR FROM THE SUBLIME HEIGHT OF HIS OWN GRANDEUR STOOPED TO BE VERY FRIENDLY WITH HIS OLD VALET AND INSISTED UPON JOSEPH'S SITTING DOWN WITH HIM AT THE WELL-SPREAD TABLE
BUT IT WAS QUITE EMPTY AND THERE WAS NO FIRE BURNING IN THE GRATE
WHICH CRIME IN A YOUNG FEMALE IS TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE ADDED MR CARTER IN AN AWFUL TONE
HE WAS USED TO TAKING HIS SLEEP IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES AND HIS MEALS AT UNUSUAL HOURS WHENEVER AND WHEREVER HE COULD GET TIME TO TAKE HIS FOOD
BUT MR KERSTALL THE YOUNGER PERCEIVED HER ANXIETY AND CAME TO HER RELIEF
ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT OBJECTS UNDER CLOUDLESS SKIES OF ULTRA-MARINE WITH STREAKS OF ORANGE AND VERMILION TO REPRESENT THE SUNSET
SHE TOLD ARTHUR LOVELL OF THIS UNLOOKED-FOR SORROW
I PERSUADED HER TO STOP AND REST
BUT IT WAS NOT HER FATHER
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT THE GIRL CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND LED MR CARTER INTO THE TWO SITTING-ROOMS IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
HENRY DUNBAR HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF PRESENTLY--"HENRY DUNBAR MR DUNBAR DID NOT AGAIN RETIRE INTO THE SHADOW
I LOVE ARTHUR ALMOST AS MUCH--OR PERHAPS QUITE AS MUCH AS IF HE WERE MY BROTHER--SO IT ISN'T STRANGE THAT I SHOULD WISH TO SEE HIM MARRIED TO MY SISTER THE TWO GIRLS MIGHT HAVE SAT TALKING FOR SOME TIME LONGER BUT THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY MISS DUNBAR'S OLD NURSE WHO NEVER FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE SERIOUS BUSINESS OF THE DAY
I SAW A WOMAN JUST NOW TALKING TO YOU IN THE OFFICE
I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY CRUEL THINGS OF YOU
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANY HARM
SHE STRUCK A LUCIFER LIGHTED HER CANDLE AND SAT DOWN WITH THE NEWSPAPER IN HER HAND
I CAN SEE HIM NOW AS HE LOOKED UP AT ME OUT OF THE WATER
I SUPPOSE THE HABIT OF SELLING DIAMONDS HAD MADE HIM RATHER SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE
TELL HER TO COME TO ME TO-MORROW MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK
BUT YOU'LL CONTRIVE TO WRITE DOWN EVERY WORD THAT'S SAID BY THE PEOPLE AT THE GEORGE BEARING UPON THE BUSINESS WE'RE HUNTING UP
ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM THE EAGER CLAMOROUS CURIOSITY WITH WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE REGARDED ANY ORDINARY MAN SUSPECTED OF THE SAME CRIME
HENRY DUNBAR TURNED ROUND AS THE CASHIER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE PARLOUR
ONE OF THE MESSENGERS WAS SENT TO FETCH POOR JOSEPH
SCARCELY SINCE I VERY RARELY READ THESE UNINTERESTING ENTRIES
YOUR BITTERNESS AGAINST HENRY DUNBAR IS VERY PAINFUL TO ME MY DEAR JOSEPH
SHE LOOKED ROUND AT JOSEPH AS HE OPENED THE DOOR
HE WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND THREE YEARS AFTER MR HENRY SAILED FOR INDIA MY BROTHER JOSEPH WILMOT WAS CONVICTED WITH TWO OR THREE OTHERS UPON A CHARGE OF MANUFACTURING FORGED BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE INDEED EXCLAIMED MR BALDERBY
AND WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE BY-AND-BY BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE CLARENDON HIS MANNER BORE AN UNDIGNIFIED RESEMBLANCE TO THAT OF A HALF-BRED CUR WHO CARRIES HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS
AND THERE'S FIVE-AND-TWENTY IN RAILWAY DEBENTURES GREAT WESTERN
WAS HIS JOURNEY TO END IN THAT BRILLIANT CITY OR WAS HE TO GO FARTHER
SHE SHIVERED A LITTLE AND LOOKED RATHER DOUBTFULLY FROM THE BLAZING
IT WAS A QUEER OLD HOUSE WITH A SLOPING ROOF AND GABLE-ENDS OF SOLID OAK ADORNED HERE AND THERE BY GRIM DEVICES CARVED BY A SKILFUL HAND
YOU DO REMEMBER ME THE OTHER MAN REPEATED WITH NO CHANGE IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
SURELY HE WILL TREMBLE WHEN HE KNOWS THAT HIS VICTIM LEFT A DAUGHTER WHO WILL REST NEITHER NIGHT NOR DAY UNTIL SHE SEES JUSTICE DONE SIR ARDEN HAD MENTIONED THE HOTEL AT WHICH HENRY DUNBAR WAS STAYING
HE COULD NOT HELP KNOWING THIS THOUGH HE WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT CONCEIT
AND I THINK HERS MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THESE
THOSE WHO KNEW THE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT CHIEF PARTNER OF THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY WERE IN NOWISE ASTONISHED BY THIS FACT
I'LL CALL FOR THEM AFTER DARK TO-NIGHT HAVING SAID THIS VERY CARELESSLY AND INDIFFERENTLY MR WILMOT LEFT THE SHOP
NO MARGARET HE THOUGHT
I SHOULD GO ON ALONE TO MEET HENRY DUNBAR THE TRAIN REACHED BASINGSTOKE
SHE HAD PITIED HIM FOR HIS SORROWS AND THE WRONGS THAT HAD BEEN DONE HIM
AND OUT OF THOSE TWO TWOS I VERILY BELIEVE I CAN MAKE THE QUEEREST FOUR THAT WAS EVER RECKONED UP BY A FIRST-CLASS DETECTIVE A FAINT FLUSH WHICH LOOKED LIKE A GLOW OF PLEASURE KINDLED ALL OVER MR CARTER'S SALLOW FACE AS HE SPOKE AND HE GOT UP AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM
I DON'T KNOW JOSEPH WILMOT ANSWERED
CHAPTER XIII
I PONDERED THE MATTER SERIOUSLY
AND SHE WENT SO QUIETLY ABOUT HER DAILY DUTIES THAT IT WAS ONLY BY THE SETTLED SADNESS OF HER FACE THE SUBDUED GRAVITY OF HER MANNER THAT PEOPLE BECAME AWARE OF SOME HEAVY GRIEF THAT HAD NEWLY FALLEN UPON HER
HIS DAUGHTER WAS STANDING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HIM
THERE WAS AN EFFLUVIUM OF VITRIOL ABOUT ALL THE BRASS-WORK AND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF BRASS-WORK IN THE REINDEER
HAVE YOU FASCINATED SOME WEALTHY HEIRESS AND ARE YOU GOING TO RETIRE INTO SPLENDID SLAVERY NO SIR
AND THE FEMALE INHABITANTS OF GODOLPHIN COTTAGES WHO GAVE HER GOOD-DAY SOMETIMES AS SHE WENT ALONG THE DUSTY LANE WITH HER WELL-USED ROLL OF MUSIC IN HER HAND DECLARED THAT SHE WAS A LADY BRED AND BORN
BUT ON REACHING THE STATION IT APPEARED THE GENTLEMAN WAS TOO LATE FOR THE TRAIN HE WANTED TO GO BY FOR HE CAME BACK TO THE FLY LIMPING AWFUL AND TOLD THE MAN TO DRIVE TO MANINGSLY
IT WANTED A QUARTER TO EIGHT WHEN HE LEFT HIS ROOM AND WENT TO HIS MOTHER'S DOOR TO INQUIRE ABOUT MARGARET
COLD MEATS RAISED PIES AND OTHER COMESTIBLES WERE LAID OUT UPON THE CARVED-OAK SIDEBOARD
I DO LOVE YOU ARTHUR SHE SAID AS DEARLY AS I SHOULD HAVE LOVED MY BROTHER HAD I EVER KNOWN A BROTHER'S LOVE THE YOUNG MAN BOWED HIS HEAD IN SILENCE
THE LAD HAS ONLY TO ASK IF ANY MESSENGER FROM MR DUNBAR HAS CALLED AT THE FERNS
AND WON'T I HAVE A FINE ACTION AGAINST YOU FOR FALSE IMPRISONMENT,--THAT'S ALL THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE MAN'S TONE OF BRAVADO THAT STAMPED IT GENUINE
IF YOU HAD HAD ONE SPARK OF NATURAL AFFECTION FOR ME YOU COULD NEVER HAVE EATEN THEIR BREAD SAMPSON WILMOT SHOOK HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY
SHE HAD SPOKEN SLOWLY PAUSING BEFORE EVERY FRESH SENTENCE
THAT WAS A HARD CASE WASN'T IT MADGE HARD CRIED THE GIRL WITH HER NOSTRILS QUIVERING AND HER HANDS CLENCHED
FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE TWO MEN PAUSED IN THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC OFFICES AND THE PRIVATE PARLOUR LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
AND I WAS NEVER MORE TO LIFT MY HEAD AMONGST HONEST PEOPLE
HIS SERVANT JEFFREYS ARRIVED AT RUGBY IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY
IT DRIPPED FROM EVERY STONE COPING AND ABUTMENT
BUT WHICH WAS SO SMALL AN ELEMENT IN THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE WOODLAND MEETINGS
THESE ANGLO-INDIANS ARE APT TO BE INDOLENT YOU KNOW AND HE MAY BE ALL THE WORSE FOR THE FATIGUES OF THE OVERLAND JOURNEY
I WANT TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER A DIAMOND-NECKLACE AS A WEDDING PRESENT AND I WANT IT TO BE SUCH AS AN EASTERN PRINCE OR A ROTHSCHILD MIGHT OFFER TO HIS ONLY CHILD
AND I WANT THE NECKLACE TO BE SOMETHING OUT OF THE COMMON
THERE WAS A LABEL PASTED ON THE LID WITH AN ADDRESS WRITTEN IN A BUSINESS-LIKE HAND MR
SHE CAN MAKE HER ARRANGEMENTS ACCORDINGLY
AND IF YOU'LL BRING MARGARET DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL STOP AT THE DEAR OLD REINDEER WHERE YOU USED TO COME MOTHER WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL AND WHERE YOU USED TO GIVE ME SUCH JOLLY DINNERS IN THE DAYS WHEN A GOOD DINNER WAS A TREAT TO A HUNGRY SCHOOLBOY MRS AUSTIN SMILED AT HER SON
I STOOD TO WIN A HATFUL OF MONEY UPON THE LIVERPOOL SUMMER MEETING AND I MADE SURE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE UP THOSE BILLS
TALLOW-DROPS WORK-IN BETTER THAN ANYTHING FOR A NECKLACE WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE TALLOW-DROPS MR HARTGOLD TOOK UP A DIAMOND WITH A PAIR OF PINCERS AND EXHIBITED IT TO THE BANKER
HE WAS QUITE SUBDUED AND SUBMISSIVE BY THIS TIME
AND THEN IN THE HUSHED STILLNESS OF THE HOUSE HENRY DUNBAR HEARD A LIGHT SHOWER OF TORN PAPER FLUTTER DOWN UPON THE POLISHED MARBLE FLOOR
BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANY MORE PARTICULAR COGNOMEN THEY HAD CHRISTENED HIM THE MAJOR
HE WASN'T DROWNED
AMONGST ALL THE THINGS I'VE EVER DREADED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS HIS LEG WAS SET IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY AND IN THE EVENING HE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION WITH THE SURGEON
BUT EVEN THOSE WHO KNEW ME BEST FAILED TO FATHOM THE DEPTH OF THAT SORROW
BUT HER SKETCHING APPARATUS LAY IDLE ON THE LITTLE TABLE BY HER SIDE AND ONE LISTLESS HAND HUNG DOWN UPON HER DRESS WITH A PENCIL HELD LOOSELY BETWEEN THE SLENDER FINGERS
THE HEAT OF THE DAY AND THE WALK TOGETHER WERE TOO MUCH FOR ME
IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE CRY WAS TAKEN UP AND TWO OR THREE HUNDRED VOICES JOINED IN A LOUD HURRAH FOR THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER
HE WENT UP TO LONDON BY THE SAME TRAIN WHICH HE HAD EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE HAD CARRIED JOSEPH WILMOT AND HIS DAUGHTER TWO NIGHTS BEFORE AND AT THE EUSTON TERMINUS HE WORKED VERY HARD ON THAT NIGHT AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY TO TRACE THE MISSING MAN
HE'S SURE TO COME TO THIS DOOR TO LOOK FOR ME--I GAVE HIM PARTICULAR ORDERS TO DO SO HENRY DUNBAR FINISHED HIS CHEROOT AND ANOTHER AND THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK CHIMED THE THREE-QUARTERS AFTER SEVEN BUT JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NOT COME BACK FROM THE FERNS
LAURA JOCELYN ROSE AND LEFT THE TABLE ATTENDED BY THE THREE YOUNG LADIES
THE WHITE LILIES ARE NEVER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN WHEN THEY WAVE CAPRICIOUSLY IN THE SUMMER WIND
REMEMBER SHE HAD NEVER SEEN REAL MISERY
YOU'RE A VAGABOND HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS SET TEETH AND YOU LOOK IT
BUT THERE IS LITTLE SUNSHINE WITHOUT ITS ATTENDANT SHADOW
BUT THEN HE ONLY TRIED TO DO RIGHT IN A SPASMODIC FITFUL KIND OF WAY AND EXPECTED HIS PRAYERS TO BE GRANTED AS SOON AS THEY WERE ASKED AND WAS INDIGNANT WITH A PROVIDENCE THAT SEEMED TO BE DEAF TO HIS ENTREATIES
THE TWO MEN HURRIED OUT TO THE PLATFORM
NO I SHALL NOT GO TO LONDON TO-NIGHT MR DUNBAR SAID
THOUGH MY DAUGHTER MY ONLY CHILD WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR SIXTEEN YEARS IS WAITING FOR ME AT MY TOWN HOUSE
SENT AWAY ON A FALSE TRAIL WHILE THE CRIMINAL GOT OFF AT HIS LEISURE
AS I HAD BEEN WATCHED IN THE STREET ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT I HAD BEEN WATCHED TO-NIGHT IN THE GROVE
BUT HE REMEMBERS NOTHING
HERE HE GOT A BED AND HERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE ELECTRA HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
IF HENRY DUNBAR WAS GRAVE AND SILENT TO-DAY WHY THAT WAS NOTHING NEW
THE CONTENTS OF THE POCKET-BOOK THAT HAD BEEN RIFLED AND THE CLOTHES WHICH HAD BEEN STRIPPED FROM THE CORPSE OF THE VICTIM
I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL ALARMED ABOUT MY FRIEND HE SAID
SHE WILL LET ME TAKE HER AWAY FROM THE COMPANIONSHIP THAT MUST BE LOATHSOME TO HER IN SPITE OF HER DEVOTION
HIS FACE WAS FLUSHED AND HIS NOSTRILS QUIVERED NERVOUSLY
IS THAT YOUR REASON FOR LEAVING US
THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WAS SUNDAY AND ALL THAT DAY THE BANKER OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN READING A MOROCCO-BOUND MANUSCRIPT VOLUME WHICH HE TOOK FROM THE DESPATCH-BOX
HIS CLOTHES IN FACT WERE VERY MUCH OF THE SAME FASHION AS THOSE WHICH JOSEPH WILMOT HAD CHOSEN FOR HIMSELF
I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT MY BUSINESS DOWN THERE BECAUSE I WANT EVERY FACILITY FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
THE PAPER WRAPPER DIRECTED IN THE DEAR HAND I LOVED THE HAND OF MARGARET WILMOT
FOR THE YOUNG MAN FROM THE JEWELLER'S HE SAYS TO MRS GRUMBLETON AT THE WESTERN LODGE HE SAYS YOUR MASTER IS NOT EASY TO SATISFY MA'AM HE SAYS
THE WORLD HAD SEEMED SO BLANK SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS CLEMENT WAS DETERMINED TO WAIT NO LONGER
YOUR FATHER HAS ARRIVED IN ENGLAND SAFELY AND IS WELL AS I BELIEVE
YOU MUST TELL US ONLY WHAT YOU ARE CERTAIN OF THEN I'M NOT CERTAIN SIR YOU ARE NOT CERTAIN THAT MR DUNBAR WAS ABSENT FOR AN HOUR NOT QUITE CERTAIN SIR BUT VERY NEARLY CERTAIN
SHE SIGNED IT WITH HER FATHER'S REAL NAME THE NAME THAT SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN BEFORE THAT DAY
TIME HEALS ALL OLD WOUNDS AND WE LEARN TO FORGIVE OTHERS AS WE HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN--DON'T WE JOSEPH YOU MAY ANSWERED THE REPROBATE FIERCELY
THEN HE SAID SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY I AM AFRAID THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THE LANDLORD FIDGETED WITH HIS PONDEROUS WATCH-CHAIN AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DUBIOUS GESTURE
THERE WAS SOME LOOSE SILVER AND A BUNCH OF KEYS IN THE WAISTCOAT-POCKET AND A WELL-WORN LEATHER-COVERED MEMORANDUM-BOOK IN THE BREAST-POCKET OF THE OLD-FASHIONED COAT
THE GRASS GREW IN THE QUIET QUADRANGLE
I SHALL BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU BY-AND-BY WHEN ALL THIS WEDDING BUSINESS IS OVER THE TWO MEN SEATED THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE UPON THE SPRING CUSHIONS OF THE BANKER'S LUXURIOUS CARRIAGE
FOR FRENCHMEN HAVE A HABIT OF HONOURING THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND MR FREDERICK KERSTALL WAS A NATURALIZED CITIZEN OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC
A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN OF A RENOWN ALMOST UNIVERSAL IN PARIS AND HIS NAME MONSIEUR HE CALLS HIMSELF KERSTALL--FREDERICK KERSTALL
THERE IS AN AIR OF OLD-WORLD QUIET IN THE OLD-FASHIONED STREET THOUGH DASHING VEHICLES DRIVE THROUGH IT SOMETIMES ON THEIR WAY TO WIMBLEDON OR RICHMOND PARK
VERY MUCH INDEED EXCLAIMED MR TIBBLES VAGUELY BUT WITH THE BITTEREST DERISION IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER
JOSEPH WILMOT SEARCHED THE POCKETS IN THE CLOTHES THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF HIS BROTHER'S SENSELESS FORM
THE MODERN SCHOOL OF PAINTING SIR IS SOMETHING MARVELLOUS TO AN OLD MAN SIR
THERE WERE FIVE BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES FOR FIVE POUNDS EACH IN ONE OF THE POCKETS AND A LETTER IN THE OTHER
WHILE I WAS IN PARIS MY FATHER WROTE TO TELL ME THAT HE MEANT TO DELAY THE MAKING OF THE NECKLACE UNTIL HE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO GO ON THE CONTINENT
I THOUGHT OF THE SELF-ABNEGATION THE HEROIC DEVOTION WHICH MADE MARGARET STRONG ENOUGH TO ENDURE SUCH AN EXISTENCE AS THIS
HIS DECLINING TO SEE YOU IS ONLY THE ACT OF A SELFISH MAN WHO HAS ALREADY SUFFERED VERY GREAT INCONVENIENCE FROM THIS BUSINESS AND WHO DREADS THE SCANDAL OF SOME TRAGICAL SCENE CHAPTER XVI
THE GIRL PUT UP HER VEIL AND LOOKED ABOUT HER
BUT I THOUGHT UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD REMAIN UPON THE SPOT IF POSSIBLE UNTIL SOME STEPS SHALL HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR THE FINDING OF THE MURDERER HE DID NOT LIKE TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIS MIND
AND MAY A HAPPIER WOMAN BE TO YOU THAT WHICH I CAN NEVER BE M
YES IT WAS IN INDIA--UP THE COUNTRY ANSWERED THE OTHER
THERE WERE ONLY A FEW PORTRAITS OF YOUNG MEN OF MILITARY ASPECT LOOKING FIERCELY OVER REGULATION STOCKS AND WITH FORKED LIGHTNING AND LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF CANNON-BALLS IN THE BACKGROUND
AND MR CARTER WHO WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF HIS ASSISTANT KNEW FROM THAT SIGN THAT THINGS HAD GONE AMISS
ARTHUR LOVELL AND THE THREE BRIDESMAIDS LINGERED A LITTLE IN THE BLUE DRAWING-ROOM
I WANT A LONG TALK AND A QUIET TALK
THERE WERE PORTRAITS OF STERN CLERICAL GRANDEES AND PARLIAMENTARY NON-CELEBRITIES WITH POPULAR BILLS ROLLED UP IN THEIR HANDS READY TO BE LAID UPON THE SPEAKER'S TABLE AND WITH A TIGHT LOOK ABOUT THE LIPS THAT SEEMED TO SAY THE MEMBER WAS PREPARED TO CARRY HIS MOTION OR PERISH ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE
OH MY GOD WHY WERE THEY DOING THAT CRIED THE MAN DROPPING SUDDENLY ON THE CHAIR NEAREST TO HIM AND WITH HIS FACE LIVID
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM GAVE HIM THE LEAST SCRAP OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION
IN ONE OF THE GREY STONE QUADRANGLES CLOSE UNDER THE CATHEDRAL WALL THE TWO MEN STILL ARM-IN-ARM STOPPED TO MAKE AN INQUIRY ABOUT MR MICHAEL MARSTON OF THE FERNS ST CROSS
AND WHATEVER I DO HENCEFORTH IN THIS BUSINESS I DO SINGLE-HANDED MR CARTER SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON HIS COMPANION
JOSEPH WILMOT ROSE FROM HIS KNEES AFTER EXAMINING THESE THINGS AND SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS
CLEMENT AUSTIN SAW THE SUDDEN CHANGE THAT HAD COME OVER HER COUNTENANCE
THERE WAS A VERY BRIEF INSCRIPTION ON THIS MODEST HEADSTONE
THERE WERE NEW WITNESSES UPON THIS DAY PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED TO HAVING BEEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE GROVE AND IN THE GROVE ITSELF UPON THAT FATAL AFTERNOON AND EVENING
HE IS STAYING AT WINCHESTER
OH NO NO
I CAN HEAR THE TICKING OF THE EIGHT-DAY CLOCK AND I CAN SEE MY MOTHER'S FOND EYES LOOKING UP AT ME EVERY NOW AND THEN
MARGARET ONCE FOR ALL LISTEN TO ME
BUT THEY CAN'T SAY MY PICTURES ARE UNGENTLEMANLY
THERE WERE PICTURES,--SIMPLE WATER-COLOUR SKETCHES,--AND CHEAP ENGRAVINGS ON THE WALLS AND A BUNCH OF FLOWERS ON THE TABLE AND BETWEEN THE MUSLIN CURTAINS THAT SHADOWED THE WINDOW YOU SAW THE BRANCHES OF THE SYCAMORES WAVING IN THE SUMMER WIND
THAT WILL DEPEND UPON CIRCUMSTANCES HE SAID
SHE PITIED HIM AND SHE TRIED TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM IN HER OWN MIND
IN MY VEXATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT I APPEALED ONCE MORE TO THE UNFAILING FRIEND OF PARTED OR PERSECUTED LOVERS THE JUPITER OF PRINTING-HOUSE SQUARE
I'VE JUST BEEN TO SEE LIZZIE AND ELLEN DORA SAID PRESENTLY
YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO SO HE SAID AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THE MAJOR LOOKED AT HIM SHARPLY
SUPPOSE I GIVE YOU TILL THURSDAY THE STONES SHALL BE READY FOR YOU BY THURSDAY SIR VERY GOOD
SO DON'T YOU BE ASHAMED OF TELLING A LOVE-STORY SIR
AMONGST THE SPECTATORS WHO HAD COME TO WITNESS MISS DUNBAR'S WEDDING WAS THE TALL GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGH WHITE HAT WHO WAS KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MAJOR AND WHO HAD EXHIBITED SO MUCH INTEREST WHEN THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR WAS MENTIONED ON THE SHORNCLIFFE RACECOURSE
POOR GIRL POOR CHILD SAID JOSEPH WILMOT
THE VERGER TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM AND FOUND HIM WIPING THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS PERFUMED SILK HANDKERCHIEF
I SHALL RUN DOWN TO SHORNCLIFFE SEE MY OLD FRIEND AND GET HAS ADVICE
THE ANGLO-INDIAN FINISHED HIS LUNCHEON LEFT THE TABLE AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW
IN THIS CASE I THINK THE CRIMINAL WILL BE MOST LIKELY ARRESTED ARTHUR LOVELL CONTINUED STILL DWELLING UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE MURDER
BUT TO HIS OWN SURPRISE SHE LOOKED MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN EVER
MARGARET HAD VERY FEW INTERVALS OF IDLENESS AND THERE WAS A KIND OF MELANCHOLY RELIEF TO HER IN SUCH AN EVENING AS THIS ON WHICH SHE WAS FREE TO THINK OF HER DEAD FATHER AND THE STRANGE STORY OF HIS DEATH
AS HE WOULD PERHAPS BE ABLE TO THROW MUCH LIGHT UPON THE ANTECEDENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS OF THE DEAD MAN
YOU AND JOHN LOVELL OF SHORNCLIFFE WERE THE EXECUTORS TO MY FATHER'S WILL
THE PASSIONATE REVENGEFUL YEARNING OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CRUELLY INJURED AND BETRAYED THE COMMON GREED OF WEALTH ENGENDERED OUT OF POVERTY'S SLOW TORTURE HAD ARISEN RAMPANT IN THIS MAN'S BREAST AT THE SIGHT OF HENRY DUNBAR
WHERE EVERY HERE AND THERE BETWEEN THE LOWER BRANCHES OF THE TREES THERE WAS A BLUE GLIMMER OF STILL WATER-POOLS HALF-HIDDEN UNDER FLAT GREEN LEAVES OF WILD AQUATIC PLANTS WHERE THERE WAS A SOLEMN STILLNESS THAT REMINDED ONE OF THE HOLY QUIET OF A CHURCH AND WHERE SIR PHILIP JOCELYN HAD EVERY CHANCE OF MEETING WITH LAURA DUNBAR
NO MYSTERY SHALL SEPARATE ME FROM THE WOMAN I LOVE CLEMENT PUT MARGARET'S LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WENT STRAIGHT TO SCOTLAND YARD WHERE HE OBTAINED AN INTRODUCTION TO A BUSINESSLIKE-LOOKING MAN SHORT AND STOUTLY BUILT WITH CLOSE-CROPPED HAIR VERY LITTLE SHIRT-COLLAR A SHABBY BLACK SATIN STOCK AND A COAT BUTTONED TIGHTLY ACROSS THE CHEST
HE HAD FOUND OUT ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW AND NOW THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
137,926L
SHE TOLD HIM SO SOMETIMES REGRETFULLY TENDERLY AS SHE SAT BY HIS SIDE WITH HER ARMS TWINED CARESSINGLY ABOUT HIS NECK
THERE'S AN EXPRESS FROM THE NORTH STOPS AT RUGBY AT SIX O'CLOCK SIR
I AM GOING ON TO SOUTHAMPTON TO EXECUTE SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS HE WAS TO HAVE DONE THERE
I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER WEDDING MAY FOLLOW MINE
NOW LISTEN TO ME JOSEPH WILMOT SAID SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY
MY DOG SHALL NEVER GROWL AT YOU AGAIN
JAMES WENTWORTH TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND BRUSHED HIS RUMPLED GREY HAIR FROM HIS FOREHEAD
HE UNFASTENED THE HALF-GLASS DOOR OPENED IT AND WENT OUT INTO THE QUADRANGULAR GARDEN THE QUAINT OLD-FASHIONED GARDEN WHERE THE FLOWER-BEDS WERE PRIMLY DOTTED ON THE SMOOTH GRASS-PLOT IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH THERE WAS A MARBLE BASIN AND THE MACHINERY OF A LITTLE FOUNTAIN THAT HAD NEVER PLAYED WITHIN THE MEMORY OF LIVING MAN
DID HE LOVE HER
IT SEEMS FROM WHAT THE TWO IRISHMEN SAY THAT THE BODY WAS DRAGGED INTO THE WATER BY THE ROPE
HE HAD BETTER COME AT ONCE CLEMENT RETURNED TO THE SITTING-ROOM AND REMAINED THERE WHILE MR VINCENT WENT TO SEE MARGARET
HE HAD THAT MEAL LAID UPON A ROUND TABLE NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ROOM LOOKED A VERY PICTURE OF COMFORT AND LUXURY AS MAJOR VERNON WENT INTO IT FRESH FROM THE BLACK FOGGY NIGHT AND THE LEAFLESS AVENUE WHERE THE BARE TRUNKS OF THE ELMS LOOKED LIKE GIGANTIC SHADOWS LOOMING THROUGH THE OBSCURITY
OH
OH
I HAD EVEN CAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE DETECTIVE'S EXCITEMENT IN THE CHASE
SHE NEED NOT HAVE HAD THAT TROUBLE POOR CHILD HAD I BEEN INCLINED TO GIVE HER INFORMATION
AND OH PHILIP I SHOULD SO LIKE TO SEE THIS OLD MR KERSTALL
AND THEY PAINTED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SIR
HER HUSBAND WAS A VERY OLD FRIEND OF MINE
I WATCHED HIS FACE AS HE PONDERED IN THE HOPE OF SEEING SOME SUDDEN MENTAL ILLUMINATION LIGHT UP HIS STOLID COUNTENANCE
I MUST HAVE LIGHT THE GIRL OBEYED
I REMEMBER NOW HOW COLD AND BRIEF HIS LETTERS FROM INDIA ALWAYS SEEMED
TO BE SURE MY DEAR
SHE KNEW THAT HE ADORED HER YOUNG MISTRESS
A FIGURE THAT HAD NO PLACE IN THE VOLUME WHICH I HAVE JUST CLOSED BUT WHICH IN THE SIX WEEKS INTERVAL BETWEEN MY LAST RECORD AND THAT WHICH I BEGIN TO-DAY HAS BECOME ALMOST AS FAMILIAR AS THE OLDEST FRIENDS OF MY YOUTH
DON'T CALL IT FOLLOWING DEAR FRIEND BECAUSE THAT'S LOW
GOING AWAY MARGARET THE CASHIER CRIED
MR CARTER STUFFED THE SLIMY BUNDLE INTO THIS BASKET AND PUT HIS ARM THROUGH THE HANDLE
AND THEN THE ENGINE GAVE ITS FAREWELL SHRIEK AND RUSHED AWAY
I LOOKED IN VAIN FOR ANY ANSWER
I HAVE THOUGHT THIS ARTHUR AND I HAVE LAIN AWAKE AT NIGHT TORTURING MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
CHAPTER X
IT WILL GET ON EQUALLY WELL WITHOUT MINE
THE GIRL'S LONG GOLDEN HAIR WET FROM THE BATH HUNG IN RIPPLING CONFUSION ABOUT HER FRESH YOUNG FACE
YOU WISH IT WITH ALL MY HEART AND YOU'RE TRUE HE CRIED BENDING DOWN TO GRASP HIS DAUGHTER'S SHOULDER AND LOOK HER IN THE FACE YOU'RE TRUE MARGARET EH?--TRUE AS STEEL
I'LL RING THE BELL IF I CHANGE MY MIND THE WAITER DEPARTED WITH A SIGH
AND THAT FELLOW VALLANCE TOO MUSED MR CARTER TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD GO AND CHUCK HIMSELF INTO THE WATER JUST TO SPITE ME
JOSEPH WILMOT SELECTED THE THINGS HE WANTED AND BEGAN TO SADDLE THE HORSE SUPPORTING HIMSELF ON HIS CANE AS HE DID SO
CHAPTER XXXII
SOME OF THEM WERE UNCERTAIN AS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LETTER H
IT SEEMED VERY HARD THAT THE CHIEF PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY COULD NOT WITH ALL HIS WEALTH BUY A LITTLE GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE TO LIGHT UP HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING
A THOUSAND THANKS MR DUNBAR
WE SHALL PLACE THE LEG IN A CRADLE FROM THE THIGH DOWNWARDS
HERE THE ARCHITECTURE BELONGED TO THE EARLY PLANTAGENET ERA
THAT'S WHAT THEY'D DO
WHY WAS THIS MAN FRIGHTENED OF HIS BEAUTIFUL CHILD?--FOR THAT IT WAS FEAR AND NOT LOVE WHICH HAD BLANCHED HENRY DUNBAR'S FACE THE LAWYER FELT POSITIVE
THE SECRET OF MY WIFE'S HISTORY IS HIDDEN IN OUR OWN BREASTS--A DARK CHAPTER IN THE CRIMINAL ROMANCE OF LIFE NEVER TO BE REVEALED UPON EARTH
THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT DRIFTED THE TWO MEN FAR AWAY FROM THE SCHOONER
THERE AIN'T MANY BITS OF BUSINESS COME OUR WAY BUT WHAT IF YOU SIFT EM TO THE BOTTOM YOU FIND A PETTICOAT
THAT'S WHY THE MAN WHO CAME BACK TO THIS HOUSE AFTER THE MURDER WAS SLOW TO SELECT THE KEY OF THE DESK
CHAPTER XXVII
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE MAY HAVE KEPT PAPA'S PORTRAIT UNTIL THIS VERY DAY AND I SHOULD SO LIKE TO HAVE A PICTURE OF MY FATHER AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND BEFORE THE TROUBLES OF A LONG LIFE ALTERED HIM LAURA SAID RATHER MOURNFULLY
THE DRIVER EXPLAINED TO MR CARTER THAT MANINGSLY WAS A LITTLE VILLAGE THREE MILES FROM SHORNCLIFFE ON A BY-ROAD
A PAIR OF WAX-CANDLES IN ANTIQUE SILVER CANDLESTICKS BURNED UPON A WRITING-TABLE NEAR THE FIREPLACE AND MADE A SPOT OF LIGHT IN THE GLOOMY BED-CHAMBER
IT'S NO USE HE SAID RISING SUDDENLY AND WALKING TO THE WINDOW
MR JOSEPH WILMOT GROWLED OUT AN OATH AND MADE A PLUNGE AT THE YOUNG SHOPMAN
I SANK UNDER MY TRIALS AND FELL LOWER AND LOWER
I AM TOLD SO SIR AND I AM OBLIGED TO BELIEVE IT SIR POOR LAURA LISTENED VERY IMPATIENTLY TO ALL THIS TALK ABOUT PAINTERS AND THEIR PICTURES
HE PAUSED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WATCHING THE MAN'S FACE WITH A THOUGHTFUL COUNTENANCE
THE MASTER OF JOCELYN'S ROCK FELL IN LOVE
MR CARTER PEERED IN AT THE BACK WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE LITTLE CASEMENT HE SAW A VISTA OF EMPTINESS
MY NIECE WAS ALL IN A FLUTTER OF EXPECTATION AND RAN OUT OF THE DRAWING-ROOM WINDOW EVERY NOW AND THEN TO SEE IF THE NEW GOVERNESS WAS COMING
I WONDER IF IT IS HE HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
THE LAST FIGURES IN THE PAGE WERE THESE
AND MY POOR DARLING WILL WANDER WITH HER WRETCHED FATHER INTO SOME REMOTE CORNER OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE SHE WILL BE HIDDEN FROM ME FOR EVER I REMEMBERED WITH UNSPEAKABLE PAIN HOW WIDE THE WORLD WAS AND HOW EASY IT WOULD BE FOR THE WOMAN I LOVED TO BE FOR EVER LOST TO ME
IF I WAS GOING TO BE PARTED FROM PHILIP TO-DAY INSTEAD OF MARRIED TO HIM I DON'T THINK I COULD FEEL MORE MISERABLE THAN I FEEL NOW
HE HAD LEFT HIS OWN AT THE RAILWAY STATION IN SAWNEY TOM'S CUSTODY
BUT I WON'T TROUBLE YOU WITH TECHNICAL DETAILS
PAPA DOES NOT WANT US SHE TOOK THE GREAT FLAPPING EARS OF THE ANIMAL IN HER TWO HANDS AND LED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM
THE KNOCKING STILL SOUNDED
AND PEOPLE DID SAY THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN VERY WEALTHY AND HAD LOST HIS MONEY IN SOME SPECULATION
AND ELIZA JANE BEING A SILLY GIGGLING HUSSEY CAN'T BEAR ME OUT IN WHAT I SAY
UNHAPPILY SOME WOMEN ARE APT TO PREFER PASSIONATE BLUSTERING OTHELLO TO SENTIMENTAL AND METAPHYSICAL HAMLET
THE MAN HAD AN ENTHUSIASTIC LOVE OF HIS PROFESSION
LAURA HE SAID WHY ARE YOU SO SILENT
THAT IS RATHER AWKWARD HE SAID
BUT SHE COULD NOT READ THOUGH THE VOLUME WAS ONE THAT HAD BEEN LENT HER BY CLEMENT AND THOUGH SHE TOOK A PECULIAR PLEASURE IN READING ANY BOOK THAT WAS A FAVOURITE OF HIS
HER MANNER FRIGHTENS ME
I WANT TO GET TO LONDON TO-NIGHT IF POSSIBLE HENRY DUNBAR WALKED AWAY HOLDING HIS HEAD HIGH IN THE AIR AND SWINGING HIS CANE AS HE WENT
WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I FOUND THE DETECTIVE SPLASHING COLD WATER IN MY FACE
MAKE MY BEST COMPLIMENTS TO HERRISTON
YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE EASY ENOUGH
HE WENT THE OTHER WAY TRAMPING THROUGH THE SNOW TOWARDS THE EASTERN GATE OF MAUDESLEY PARK
BUT THOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS QUEENLIKE IT WAS NOT IMPERIOUS
WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE RELAPSED ONCE MORE INTO A REVERIE DURING WHICH I SAT LISTENING TO THE TICKING OF AN EIGHT-DAY CLOCK IN THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE OUR SITTING-ROOM AND THE OCCASIONAL TRAMP OF A PASSING FOOTSTEP ON THE PAVEMENT BELOW OUR WINDOWS
I DON'T KNOW YOU MY GOOD SIR STAMMERED SAMPSON
I AM GOING THERE TO TRY AND DISCOVER SOME TIDINGS OF HER
BUT HIS UNCLE CHECKED HIM
JOSEPH WILMOT WAS A FAVOURITE SERVANT OF MINE FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO
MISS DUNBAR PLACED HERSELF BESIDE HER FATHER AND WOUND HER ARM ABOUT HIS NECK
HE WORE A BEARD AND THICK MOUSTACHE OF GRIZZLED AUBURN
ONLY TOO WELL ONLY TOO WELL
IF THAT TURN-OUT HAD COST YOU FIFTY POUND SIR INSTEAD OF EIGHTEEN POUND TWELVE AND ELEVENPENCE IT WOULD BE WORTH ALL THE MONEY TO YOU
HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH A HOLLOW FIENDISH-SOUNDING LAUGH AND THEN CLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER TILL THE NOISE OF HIS BRAWNY PALMS ECHOED IN THE RUSTIC SILENCE
THEN HE PUT THE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT UNDER HIS PILLOW AND WENT TO BED
LAURA SEES THE SCARLET JACKET RISE FOR A MOMENT AGAINST THE LOW GREY SKY AND THEN FLY ONWARD AND THAT IS ABOUT ALL SHE SEES OF THE DREADED LEAP WHICH SHE HAD LOOKED AT IN FEAR AND TREMBLING THE DAY BEFORE
IT WAS TOO CRUEL TO STAND BY AND UTTER NO WORD OF COMFORT TO THIS SOBBING GIRL
I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULDN'T WIN A LITTLE MONEY UPON HENRY DUNBAR
AND I WILL WAIT FOR YOU THERE I SAID THIS AND I TOLD HIM TO BE AS QUICK AS HE COULD THAT WAS ALL THAT PASSED BETWEEN YOU IT WAS
HIS FACE WAS DEADLY PALE AND THERE WAS A SINGULARLY RIGID EXPRESSION ABOUT HIS MOUTH
GIVING IT UP XLVI
THE RATTLING HANSOM SEEMED A FAIRY CAR THAT WAS BEARING ME IN TRIUMPH THROUGH A REGION OF BRIGHTNESS AND SPLENDOUR
FOR THE OLD VALET ONLY MET HIM AT SOUTHAMPTON TWO OR THREE HOURS BEFORE THE MURDER WAS COMMITTED
WITH THIS FEEBLE LIGHT HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE LOVELY MOONLIGHT AND STUMBLED DOWN INTO A LOW-CEILINGED CABIN DARKSOME AND DIRTY WITH BERTHS WHICH WERE AS BLACK AND DINGY AND ALTOGETHER AS UNINVITING AS THE SHELVES MADE TO HOLD COFFINS IN A NOISOME UNDERGROUND VAULT
I SHAN'T BE AWAY ABOVE AN HOUR I DARE SAY
MR HENRY DUNBAR COMMITTED A GREAT SIN WHEN HE TEMPTED THAT LAD TO WRONG
THE HOUSE WAS A ROOMY OLD PLACE WITH LONG CORRIDORS AND WIDE STAIRCASES
HE BORE THE PAIN WELL ENOUGH BUT HE CHAFED PERPETUALLY AGAINST THE DELAY
IT IS RARELY THAT A MAN WITH ALMOST UNLIMITED WEALTH AT HIS COMMAND FINDS HIMSELF COMPELLED TO COMMIT AN ACT OF VIOLENCE THE MAGISTRATE READ ALOUD MARGARET WILMOT'S DEPOSITION AND THE GIRL SIGNED IT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CLERK
CURSE HIM JOSEPH WILMOT SAT FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED UPON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM BROODING BROODING BROODING
I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOU IF YOUR NERVES ARE NO BETTER THAN THAT WHEN MAJOR VERNON THAT NIGHT LEFT HIS FRIEND HE CARRIED AWAY WITH HIM HALF-A-DOZEN CHEQUES FOR DIFFERENT AMOUNTS MAKING IN ALL TWO THOUSAND POUNDS UPON THAT PRIVATE BANKING-ACCOUNT WHICH MR DUNBAR KEPT FOR HIMSELF IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
I HAVE HAD GOOD REASON TO REMEMBER IT MARGARET WILMOT WAS NOT QUITE ALONE IN HER SORROW
I SAY IT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T TRUSTED ME I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR YOU TO KNOW I SAID
I'VE SO MUCH REASON TO LOOK CHEERFUL HAVEN'T I HE SAID IN THE SAME TONE HE HAD USED WHEN HE HAD DECLARED HIS ACCEPTANCE OF THE BANKER'S BOUNTY
SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY PERHAPS IN SEEING SIR ARDEN HAD NOT THE RAILWAY PORTER IMMEDIATELY DECLARED HER BUSINESS
I SEEM TO REMEMBER SOME OLD RHYME ABOUT THE BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHINES ON AND THE BRIDE THAT THE RAIN RAINS ON LAWS MISS LAURA YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY AS YOU'D BEMEAN YOURSELF BY TAKING ANY HEED OF SUCH LOW RUBBISH AS THAT EXCLAIMED MRS MADDEN
FOR TAKE HIM I SURELY SHALL
THE DRIVER WAS SUMMONED AT MR CARTER'S REQUEST AND FROM HIM THE DETECTIVE ASCERTAINED THAT A GENTLEMAN WRAPPED UP TO THE VERY NOSE AND WEARING A COAT LINED WITH FUR AND WALKING VERY LAME HAD BEEN TAKEN UP BY HIM AT WOODBINE COTTAGE
THEY WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY
START WITH A CONVICTION OF THE MAN'S GUILT AND YOU'LL GO HUNTING UP EVIDENCE TO BOLSTER THAT CONVICTION
YOU KNOW MR LOVELL--MR ARTHUR LOVELL YES SIR
THAT EVERY WORD IS GREEDILY LISTENED TO BY MEN WHO ARE EAGER TO BRING HIS GUILT HOME TO HIM
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERY THING HE SAW
AND A CUSSIN OF HIS MASTER PROMISKRUOUS TO THE SAME ACQUAINTANCE FOR TELE-GRAPHIN FOR HIM TO GO BY SECH A TRAIN
THE RATS HAD BEEN AT WORK
OH NO
BUT THE MAN WHO COMMISSIONED IT SENT IT BACK TO ME FOR ALTERATION
AND HERE THEY SAT TOGETHER FOR UPWARDS OF AN HOUR DISCUSSING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MURDER AT WINCHESTER AND THE CONDUCT OF MR DUNBAR SINCE THAT EVENT
XVII
HE LISTENED FOR AN APOLOGETIC MURMUR FROM THE YOUNG WOMAN
DRINK YOUR WINE WILMOT HE EXCLAIMED
I SHALL BUY THE DIAMONDS MYSELF AND HAVE THEM SET ACCORDING TO MY OWN DESIGN THE BRIDESMAIDS GAVE A LITTLE MURMUR OF DELIGHT
SHE OPENED THE GATE OF THE SIMPLE COTTAGE-GARDEN--THERE WAS NO NEED OF BOLTS OR LOCKS FOR THE FORTIFICATION OF GODOLPHIN COTTAGES--AND WENT UP TO HER OWN LITTLE SITTING-ROOM,--THE ROOM IN WHICH HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER THE SECRET OF HIS LIFE,--THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD SWORN TO REMEMBER THE HENRY DUNBAR
AND THAT PLACES US AT ONCE ON THE FOOTING OF GOOD CUSTOMERS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE BETTER CUSTOMERS
THIS WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT THE VERGER GAVE BEFORE SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE
THE CARPET-BAG CONTAINED A PAIR OF BOOTS A HAT-BRUSH A NIGHT-SHIRT AND A FADED OLD CHINTZ DRESSING-GOWN
NOW LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND PERJURING HER SIMPLE SOUL BY DECLARING THAT IT"--NAMELY THE WINTER SKY--WAS GOING TO CLEAR UP
WHY IT WOULD BE AS MUCH AS MY PLACE IS WORTH TO DO IT
UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES I'M OBLIGED TO BE CANDID
EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO SLOW AND QUIET IN THEIR COURSE THAT I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MYSELF AN OLD MAN OLDER THAN MANY OLD MEN INASMUCH AS I HAD OUTLIVED THE WRECK OF THE ONE BRIGHT HOPE WHICH HAD MADE LIFE DEAR TO ME
AND HE KEPT UP THE SAME SHUFFLING AND THE SAME SLAPPING WHILE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH HIS SUPERIOR IN A DISRESPECTFUL IF NOT DEFIANT MANNER
I HAVE GIVEN YOU NO WEDDING-PRESENT YET BUT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN
HAVE PITY UPON ME AND LET ME GO SHE DREW A PRETTY LITTLE WATCH FROM HER WAIST AND LOOKED AT THE DIAL
HE WAS NOT A PASSIONATE MAN
I DON'T THINK I NEED DETAIN YOU ANY LONGER
LORD YARSFIELD--A VERY OLD CUSTOMER--TALKS OF BUYING AN ESTATE IN WALES
BUT STRONGER THAN THIS FEELING OF SELF-REPROACH WAS HER INDIGNATION AGAINST SIR PHILIP
IT'S A STRANGE QUESTION I KNOW MY LADY--OR IT SEEMS A STRANGE QUESTION--BUT THERE'S MORE IN THE ANSWER THAN YOU CAN GUESS AND I SHALL BE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU IF YOU'LL ANSWER IT CANDIDLY A FAINT FLUSH CREPT OVER LAURA'S FACE AND THE TEARS STARTED SUDDENLY TO HER EYES
FOR EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SUDDEN TERROR THAT THE TRAIN HAD FALLEN OUT OF ITS REGULAR PACE AND WAS CRAWLING SLOWLY ALONG THE RAILS
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU KNOW LAURA MUCH BETTER THAN I DO YOU MAY AS WELL COME WITH ME MR DUNBAR'S LOOKS BELIED THE CARELESSNESS OF HIS WORDS
I KNOW MY WAY THE MAJOR OPENED THE DOOR LEADING TO MR DUNBAR'S APARTMENTS AND WALKED WITHOUT CEREMONY INTO THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER WHERE HE FOUND THE BANKER SITTING NEAR A TABLE UPON WHICH A SILVER COFFEE SERVICE A DRESDEN CUP AND SAUCER AND TWO OR THREE COVERED DISHES GAVE EVIDENCE THAT MR DUNBAR HAD BEEN BREAKFASTING
I HAVE MY CHEQUE-BOOK IN MY POCKET
AND AS SOON AS EVER YOU HEAR ME AND THE LANDLORD OR ME AND THE WAITER AS THE CASE MAY BE WORKING ROUND TO THE MURDER YOU'LL TAKE OUT YOUR DESK AND BEGIN TO WRITE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE NOTES OF THE CONVERSATION I SAID
EVER-DEAREST CLEMENT,--_THE SAD AND MISERABLE SECRET WHICH LED TO OUR PARTING IS A SECRET NO LONGER
YOU REMEMBER THE ORIENTAL BLOKE THAT ALWAYS ASKED WHO IS SHE WHEN HE HEARD OF A FIGHT OR A FIRE OR A MAD BULL BROKE LOOSE OR ANY TRIFLING CALAMITY OF THAT SORT
KYLMINGTON
BUT HE OFFERED HER HIS HAND AND SHE LAID THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS IN HIS BROAD PALM AND WENT WITH HIM TO THE CARRIAGE
GIVING IT UP
THERE WERE INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE PRESENT AMONGST OTHERS SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE ONE OF THE COUNTY MAGISTRATES RESIDENT AT WINCHESTER
AND THEN A DARK FIGURE THAT WAS STRANGE TO HIM CAME BETWEEN HIM AND THAT GENTLE SHADOW AND THRUST THE VISION AWAY WITH A RUTHLESS HAND
MARGARET WILMOT FOUND ONE OF HER PUPILS WAITING IN THE PRETTY LITTLE PARLOUR IN THE COTTAGE AT CLAPHAM AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND LISTEN TO A FANTASIA VERY BADLY PLAYED KEEPING SHARP WATCH UPON THE PUPIL'S FINGERS FOR AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE SHE WAS FREE TO THINK HER OWN THOUGHTS
HE SAW ALL THESE AND STILL FOR EVER AMID A THOUSAND DISTRACTING IDEAS HIS THOUGHTS WHICH WERE BEYOND HIS OWN VOLITION CONCENTRATED IN THE ONE PLAGUE-SPOT OF HIS LIFE AND HELD HIM THERE FIXED AS A WRETCH BOUND HAND AND FOOT UPON THE RACK
BUT MANY STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS WORLD BEFORE NOW
THE DOUBLE DUNBAR WAS STILL ESSENTIAL TO US THOUGH THE LAST OF THE MALE DUNBARS WAS DEAD AND BURIED UNDER THE CHANCEL OF LISFORD CHURCH
HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRUSTED
SHE KNEW ALL MARGARET'S STORY NOW AND SHE SYMPATHIZED WITH MY LOVE AND ADMIRATION FOR JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER
NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE THAT SORROW CLEMENT
HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF FORGERY
EVERY ONE OF THESE CANVAS-BAGS WAS FULL OF LOOSE DIAMONDS
AND IT WAS ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT INFORMATION THAT THE GIRL HAD COME TO ST GUNDOLPH LANE WITH THE DETERMINATION OF SEEING THE MAN WHOM SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER
THE MURDERER OF HENRY DUNBAR HAD ONCE TRIED TO BE HONEST AND HAD PRAYED GOD TO PROSPER HIS HONESTY
AND THAT EVEN YOUR POOR MAR WHICH HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN ANY LIVIN CREATURE UPON THIS EARTH WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM THE SMILE HAD QUITE VANISHED FROM LAURA DUNBAR'S FACE BY THIS TIME AND THE BLUE EYES FILLED SUDDENLY WITH TEARS
TILL MY MIND HAS GROWN SO FULL OF THE DARK PICTURE THAT I HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE CABIN IN THE CRUEL RESTLESS SHIP AND MY FATHER LYING HELPLESS ON A NARROW BED WITH ONLY STRANGERS TO WATCH HIS DEATH-HOUR
THE DINNER-PARTY WAS A VERY CHEERFUL ONE AS FAR AS MR DUNBAR AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE CONCERNED
THE EXCHEQUER BILLS SHALL BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY GOOD
I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING-ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
IF YOU THINK THEY AIN'T GENUINE SEND EM ROUND TO ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBOURS AND GET EM CHANGED JOSEPH WILMOT SAID
I SHALL NOT TROUBLE MYSELF TO SET THEM RIGHT THE WAITER RE-ENTERED THE ROOM AS MR DUNBAR FINISHED SPEAKING
THE MAN WHEELED A WRITING-TABLE TOWARDS THE BANKER
SHE DISCOVERED THAT THE GIRL HAD MORE THAN AN ORDINARY TALENT FOR MUSIC
AND YET WHAT IF BY SO DOING HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ANOTHER CHANCE OF HAPPINESS
SHE HUNG HER HEAD BUT DID NOT ANSWER HIM
BUT THERE WAS NO TRAIN FOR WARWICKSHIRE BEFORE THE SIX-O'CLOCK PARLIAMENTARY AND THERE WAS A SEVEN-O'CLOCK EXPRESS WHICH WOULD REACH RUGBY TEN MINUTES AFTER THAT MISERABLY SLOW CONVEYANCE
THE PAVEMENT SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT THERE HAD JUST BEEN AN OUTBREAK OF THE POPULACE AND THAT THE STONES HAD BEEN RUTHLESSLY TORN UP TO SERVE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BARRICADES AND ONLY VERY CARELESSLY PUT DOWN AGAIN
HIS EYES RAN EAGERLY DOWN THE LONG ROW OF FIGURES BEFORE HIM UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE SUM TOTAL
I SUPPOSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO MY LOOKING ABOUT YOUR HOUSE AND ROUND THE GARDEN AND OUTBUILDINGS
THE OLD CLERK'S EVIDENCE MIGHT BE MOST IMPORTANT IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS
AND SHE WAS A PRETTY LITTLE COUNTRY GIRL AS FRESH AND INNOCENT AS THE DAISIES IN HER FATHER'S PADDOCKS
I MAY AS WELL BURN MISS CARPENTER'S HAIR BY THE WAY
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE GATES AND THEY SHUT BEHIND HIM WITH A LOUD CLANGING NOISE
I SHALL GET THE BILLS BACK INTO MY OWN HANDS BEFORE THEY FALL DUE JOE HE SAID
YOUR MORALS AND YOUR GRAMMAR ARE ABOUT A MATCH MISS BETSY
IT WAS A VERY DULL UNPLEASANT DAY AND I WAS GLAD TO DRAW MY CHAIR TO THE FIRE AND MAKE MYSELF COMFORTABLE WHILE THE WAITER WENT TO FETCH A BOTTLE OF SODA-WATER AND SIXPENN'ORTH OF BEST FRENCH FOR MY COMPANION WHO WAS WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND HIS GRIZZLED EYEBROWS KNOTTED TOGETHER
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE AMONGST BAD MEN WHO WILL HARDEN YOUR HEART
HE HAD NO LOVE FOR HIS BROTHER
AND THAT I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO WISH HIM GOOD MORNING THE DETECTIVE SAID THIS AS HE WENT DOWN STAIRS
I MADE HER TAKE MY ARM AND LEAN UPON IT AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW PATH TALKING UNTIL THE LAST LOW LINE OF LIGHT FADED OUT OF THE DUSKY SKY
WHICH OF YOU WILL CATCH HER FOR A COUPLE OF SOVEREIGNS THE MEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS
AND THEN I AM TO GO ON TO WINCHESTER TAKING A LAWYER WITH ME A LAWYER EXCLAIMED LAURA
I LOITERED IDLY THROUGH THE STREET STARING AT THE SHOP-WINDOWS IN UTTER ABSENCE OF MIND WHILE I THOUGHT WHAT COULD I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT EVENING
HE WAS AN ONLY SON AND HE WAS HEIR TO A VERY COMFORTABLE LITTLE FORTUNE
SIR PHILIP JOCELYN THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD MARRY SOME OF THESE DAYS AND IN THE MEANTIME TROUBLED HIMSELF VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE PRETTY DAUGHTERS OF COUNTRY GENTLEMEN WHOM HE MET NOW AND AGAIN AT RACES AND ARCHERY-MEETINGS AND FLOWER-SHOWS AND DINNER-PARTIES AND HUNTING-BALLS IN THE QUEER OLD TOWN-HALL AT SHORNCLIFFE
I MERELY SAID TO THE DECEASED I SHALL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE CATHEDRAL
YOU DO NOT THINK THE PICTURE HAS BEEN DESTROYED DO YOU LAURA ASKED EAGERLY
THE PENCIL DROPPED FROM BETWEEN HER IDLE FINGERS AND SHE ROSE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE INTRUDER
IT WAS DUSK AND SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED WITH A BLACK STRAW BONNET AND A VEIL OVER HER FACE
AND WITH A BALANCE OF HALF A MILLION OR SO AT ONE'S BANKER'S OR IN ONE'S OWN BANK--WHICH IS BETTER STILL PERHAPS--ONE IS NOT SO BADLY OFF EH MR DUNBAR SIT DOWN AND EAT ONE OF THOSE BIRDS ANSWERED THE BANKER
JUST NOW HOWEVER I HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN CAB-DRIVES LOST OMNIBUSES AND THE PERUSAL OF A FAVOURITE BOOK TO JOT DOWN INASMUCH AS MY MOTHER AND MYSELF HAVE LATELY HAD ALL OUR ACCUSTOMED HABITS IN A MANNER DISORGANIZED BY THE ADVENT OF A LADY
HE WAS RARELY KNOWN TO MISS A RACE
BUT HE DID ALL HE COULD NEVERTHELESS FOR THE UNCONSCIOUS OLD MAN
HE WAS A REDUCED GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SEEN BETTER DAYS
AND TO HER THIS SEEMED QUITE ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD SERVANT
THIS IT THE LAST YOU WILL EVER HEAR OF ONE WHOSE NAME MUST SOUND ODIOUS TO THE EARS OF HONEST MEN
DON'T LET'S HAVE ANY OF THAT FOOLING CRIED A HARSH VOICE FROM THE LITTLE PARLOUR
AND PRESENTLY THE WEDDING-TRAIN CAME UP THE NARROW AISLE AND TOOK THEIR PLACES ABOUT THE ALTAR-RAILS
DID EVER ANYBODY KNOW ANYTHING SO PROVOKING LOR MISS LAURA REJOINED THE SYMPATHETIC MADDEN THERE'S ALL MANNER OF PROVOKING THINGS ALLUS HAPPENIN IN THIS BLESSED WICKED RAMPAGIOUS WORLD OF OURS
I COULD UNDERSTAND ALL NOW
I COULD UNDERSTAND ALL NOW
I COULD UNDERSTAND ALL NOW
FOR I WILL FOLLOW HIM WHEREVER HE GOES UNTIL I LOOK INTO HIS FACE AND SAY THAT WHICH I HAVE TO SAY TO HIM THE GIRL DID NOT SPEAK LOUDLY OR VIOLENTLY
SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL YARD ACROSS WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD GONE ARM-IN-ARM WITH HIS COMPANION
BUT WHEN THE JEWELLER'S AGENT CAME TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS MR DUNBAR COULD FIND NO DESIGN THAT SUITED HIM
THEY DON'T MEAN TO DO ANY WRONG--THEY DON'T INTEND TO ROB ANY BODY OF A SIXPENCE
GRANDPAPA WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME
AND I WILL DO MY UTTERMOST WITH GOD'S HELP TO BRING THIS CRIME HOME TO HIM THE GIRL'S EYES FLASHED WITH A PROUD LIGHT AS CLEMENT AUSTIN FINISHED SPEAKING
EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE TO HIM WHO HAS SWORN TO CONQUER
THE POLISHED OAK WAINSCOTING WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
I KNOW HOW THE WORLD'S USED ME FOR THE LAST FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS
A FRENCH MILLINER WHO LOOKED LIKE A LADY OF FASHION ARRIVED ONE MORNING AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS POOR LAURA HAD TO ENDURE THE SLOW AGONY OF TRYING ON WHILE MRS MADDEN AND DORA MACMAHON DISCUSSED ALL THE COLOURS IN THE RAINBOW AND A GREAT MANY NEW SHADES AND COMBINATIONS OF COLOUR INVENTED BY ASPIRING FRENCH CHEMISTS
BUT YOU ARE VERY CRUEL TO ME TO-DAY
AND THEN I WENT BACK TO THE VICTORIER AND GOT A NIGHT'S LODGIN
YOU COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO CRUEL AS TO DECEIVE ME MARGARET LOOKED UP AT HER LOVER WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE
I DID NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE TO THE FERNS AND I DID NOT MAKE ANY CALCULATION AS TO TIME
ONE BY ONE THE PROSTRATE FORMS WERE BORNE AWAY BY QUIET BEARERS WHO DID THEIR DUTY CALMLY AND FEARLESSLY IN THAT HIDEOUS SCENE OF HAVOC AND CONFUSION
HE HAS BEEN A VOLUNTARY EXILE FROM ENGLAND FOR THE LAST FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS SO I FEAR HE WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME OF DUNBAR
BUT WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE INTO THE HALL AND BAR AND SECHLIKE THERE WASN'T A MORTAL VESTIGE OF THAT MAN TO BE SEEN
HER FATHER BY A HUNDRED TACIT SIGNS REJECTED HER AFFECTION
HIS MASTER MIGHT NEVER HAVE DONE WRONG BUT FOR HIM JOSEPH DID NOT SAY A WORD IN ANSWER TO ALL THIS
THERE WERE A GREAT MANY DINGY PERFORMANCES OF MR KERSTALL SENIOR
THE VERGER SAW US AND SPOKE TO US AS WE WENT BY THE VERGER WHO WAS STANDING AMONGST THE OTHER WITNESSES WAITING TO BE EXAMINED HERE EXCLAIMED AY THAT I DID SIR
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME
THE GREAT MR DUNBAR
WELL SIR IF THAT ORIENTAL POTENTATE HAD LIVED IN OUR TIMES AND BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THE DETECTIVE LINE I'M BLEST IF HE NEED HAVE CHANGED HIS OPINIONS
AN INQUEST HAD BEEN HELD UPON HIS REMAINS SOME DAYS BEFORE AND HE HAD BEEN BURIED BY THE PARISH
THE STEEPLE-CHASE
YOUR HAND UPON IT
I BEG TO TELL YOU MY DEAR SIR THAT I AM UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE SAID OF ME
ON THE TRACK XLIV
JOSEPH WILMOT STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON HIS HEAD AND THEN THE SHADOWS FADED FROM HIS FACE WHICH SUDDENLY BECAME FIXED AND RESOLUTE-LOOKING
FOR THERE WAS NO MURMUR OF VOICES NO SOUND OF ANY ONE MOVING IN THE APARTMENT
WE SHALL NO MORE CATCH T CROW THAN WE SHALL CATCH T DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY UNLESS T WIND CHANGES I DOUBT T WIND WILL CHANGE AFTER DARK ANSWERED THE OTHER YOUNG MAN WHO HAD APPLIED HIMSELF OFTENER THAN HIS COMPANION TO THE STONE-BOTTLE AND TOOK A MORE HOPEFUL VIEW OF THINGS
BUT IT'S NO USE
GREAT WOODEN BARRICADES AND MOUNTAINS OF UPROOTED PAVING-STONES AMIDST WHICH STURDY NAVIGATORS DISPORTED THEMSELVES WITH SPADES AND PICKAXES AND WHEELBARROWS FULL OF RUBBISH BLOCKED THE WAY
THIS MAN MAY HAVE PLAYED ME A TRICK AND GONE OFF FOR SOME PURPOSE OF HIS OWN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT PURPOSE
THE DUKE OF BRUNSWICK HAS PRETTY WELL CLEARED THE MARKET OF THAT SORT OF STUFF
ALL THE WEALTH OF THIS WORLD CANNOT BUY PEACE FOR HENRY DUNBAR OR FORGETFULNESS
THE LIGHTED WINDOWS SHONE OUT UPON THE DARKNESS
BUT HE DREW HIS CASHMERE SHAWL STILL HIGHER UP ABOUT HIS EARS TOOK OUT A GAUDY SCARLET-MOROCCO CIGAR-CASE LIGHTED ANOTHER BIG CIGAR AND THEN STROLLED SLOWLY DOWN THE QUIET WEST-END STREET WITH HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS CONTRACTED INTO A THOUGHTFUL FROWN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT ME
HE WAS A GOOD MAN AS MARGARET HAD JUST DECLARED
YES IT WAS SOMETHING TO BE SPOKEN TO SO KINDLY IN THAT DEEP MANLY VOICE
NOW HIDING IN DIM GROVES OF SPREADING ELMS
LUCKILY MR VINCENT THE SURGEON WAS AT HOME
BUT PHILIP ONLY MADE LIGHT OF HER FEARS AND TOLD HER THE LEAPS WERE NOTHING SCARCELY WORTHY OF THE CHESTNUT MARE'S POWERS
OF ALL THE INNERCENT YOUNG MEN AS EVER WAS EXPOSED TO THE TEMPTATIONS OF THIS WICKED WORLD THERE NEVER WAS SECH A YOUNG INNERCENT AS THAT LAWYER'S CLERK A CARRYIN A BLUE BAG AND A TELLIN A PROMISKRUOUS ACQUAINTANCE LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE GENT IN THE FUR COAT TO HEAR THAT HE'D BEEN TELEGRAPHED FOR BY HIS MASTER WHICH WAS DOWN BEYOND HULL ON ELECTIONEERIN BUSINESS
MR DUNBAR LEANT BACK IN THE CORNER OF HIS COMFORTABLE SEAT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED
IF THE TATERS ISN'T DONE TO HIS LIKIN SIR HE'LL GRUMBLE ABOUT THEM QUITE CIVIL AT FIRST AND THEN HE'LL WORK HISSELF UP LIKE AND TAKE AND THROW THEM AT ME ONE BY ONE AND HIS LANGUAGE GETS WORSE WITH EVERY TATER
HIS ROOM WAS NEAR THOSE OCCUPIED BY HIS MOTHER AND MARGARET MUCH NEARER THAN THE SITTING-ROOM
HE WAS A MAN IN WHOM NO FORCE OF FASHION OR COMPANIONSHIP WOULD EVER ENGENDER THE PEEVISH BLASE_-NESS SO MUCH AFFECTED BY MODERN YOUTH
THE DEAD MAN MUST REST IN HIS GRAVE
SPECIAL HOURS WERE APPOINTED FOR THESE ARTISTIC STUDIES
HIS LAST ACT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT WHICH LAID HIM UP SO LONG WAS TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO LONDON ON PURPOSE TO BUY DIAMONDS FOR A NECKLACE WHICH WAS TO BE HIS WEDDING PRESENT TO ME
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU SATISFACTION
FOR I DREW OUT THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET PRESENTLY AND EMPTIED ITS CONTENTS UPON THE FLOOR IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT MAKE SURE OF THERE BEING NO IMPORTANT PAPER THROWN BY CHANCE AMONGST THEM BEFORE I CONSIGNED THEM TO BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE HOUSEMAID
SHE SHUNS ALL ALLUSION TO HER HOME OR HER PAST HISTORY
LIE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND IT DRY AND BURNING WITH FEVERISH HEAT
STEADY BOY STEADY
HER FOOTSTEPS MADE NO SOUND ON THE THICK TURKEY CARPET
I COULD NOT SAY THAT I HAD ENGAGED HER BECAUSE HER EYES WERE HAZEL AND HER HAIR OF THE SAME COLOUR
I SAW A CARD JUST NOW IN THE HIGH STREET AND AS I AM SEARCHING FOR AN INSTRUCTRESS FOR MY LITTLE NIECE I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF CALLING
HE HEARD THE MAN SPEAK TO MARGARET WILMOT AS HE DELIVERED THE LETTER
AND THOUGH THE MAJOR PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD PRETTY RAPIDLY HE WAS TOO LATE TO WITNESS ITS DEPARTURE
HE HAD CALLED HIMSELF BY A FALSE NAME--BUT LAST NIGHT AFTER HEARING OF THE--THE--MURDER"--THE HORRIBLE WORD SEEMED TO SUFFOCATE HER BUT SHE STILL WENT BRAVELY ON--"I SEARCHED A BOX OF MY FATHER'S AND FOUND THIS SHE TOOK FROM HER POCKET THE LETTER DIRECTED TO NORFOLK ISLAND AND HANDED IT TO THE LAWYER
HE IS THE OUTCAST OF SOCIETY
THERE IS A VERY WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEELINGS OF THE POOR ADVENTURER--WHO BY SOME LUCKY ACCIDENT IS ENABLED TO POUNCE UPON A RICH FRIEND--AND THE SENTIMENTS OF THE WEALTHY VICTIM WHO IS POUNCED UPON
THESE WERE THE THOUGHTS FOR EVER REVOLVING IN MY TIRED BRAIN WHILE I WAITED FOR TIDINGS FROM THE DETECTIVE
HEAVEN KNOWS HOW HE MAY HAVE THREATENED HER
IF THERE'S ANY FAITH TO BE PUT IN THIS SHE WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE ME HOME AT LAST HENRY DUNBAR SAID AS HE DREW THE LETTER OUT OF ITS ENVELOPE
WHO IS IT THAT WANTS TO SEE ME LORD HERRISTON THE GREAT ANGLO-INDIAN STATESMAN
I REMEMBER HIM TOO THE OLD MAN CRIED WITH A TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE
FOR PITY'S SAKE TELL ME THAT IT IS SO AND I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING INVOLUNTARILY DECEIVED ME AND WILL TRY TO CURE MYSELF OF MY FOLLY
IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO SIT DOWN IN THE HALL I'LL GO TO MR DUNBAR IMMEDIATELY
THE HORSE WAS TEARING UP THE WET GRAVEL AND MAKING FURIOUS CHAMPING NOISES IN HIS IMPATIENCE OF ALL THIS DELAY
THE RUSTLING DRESS THE SHADOWY FIGURE MELTING IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE RAIN-BLOTTED LANDSCAPE HAD BELONGED TO MARGARET WILMOT
HIS SUBJECTS WERE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL
IT'S NOT TO BE THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND THE END
IF ARTHUR ACCEPTED THE APPOINTMENT HE WOULD NOT BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE ENGLAND UNTIL THE END OF A TWELVEMONTH AS THE VACANCY WOULD NOT OCCUR BEFORE THAT TIME
TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS SIR PHILIP JOCELYN CAME ACROSS THE COURSE WITH A GREAT SILVER-GILT CUP IN HIS ARMS AND SURROUNDED BY AN ADMIRING THRONG AMONGST WHOM HE HAD JUST EMPTIED HIS PURSE
AND THE VERY FIRST FAVOUR I DEMAND OF YOU WHICH IS ONLY THE GIFT OF THIS CLEVER LITTLE HAND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO REFUSE ME POINT-BLANK HE WAITED FOR A FEW MOMENTS IN THE HOPE THAT MARGARET WOULD SAY SOMETHING
I FIND THE WARWICKSHIRE AIR AGREE WITH ME REMARKABLY WELL HE SAID TO THE LANDLORD AS HE SAT AT BREAKFAST IN THE BAR-PARLOUR UPON THE SECOND DAY AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH HENRY DUNBAR
AS HE RECEDED FROM THE ADVANCING DETECTIVE ONE OF THE FISHERMEN SPRANG TOWARDS HIM FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE DECK
HENRY DUNBAR SMILED
CAN YOU REMOVE THE STAMP OF THE FELON FROM ME AND WIN FOR ME THE POSITION I MIGHT HAVE HELD IN THIS HARD WORLD BUT FOR YOU
HE FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT THESE BOATS THEIR DESTINATION AND THE HOURS AND DAYS ON WHICH THEY WERE TO START AND MADE HIMSELF MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE WATER-TRAFFIC OF THE PLACE IN HALF AN HOUR THAN ANOTHER MAN COULD HAVE DONE IN A DAY
AND BELIEVE ME I SHALL HAVE YOUR INTERESTS AT HEART THROUGHOUT THIS MATTER
I TRIED TO LIVE DISHONESTLY AND I LED A WILD RACKETY DARE-DEVIL KIND OF A LIFE AMONGST MEN WHO FOUND THEY HAD A SKILFUL TOOL AND KNEW HOW TO USE ME
THE GIRL'S FIGURE TALL SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE IMPARTED GRACE AND BEAUTY TO A SHABBY COTTON DRESS AND LINEN COLLAR THAT MANY A MAID-SERVANT WOULD HAVE DISDAINED TO WEAR
WHAT WORDS CAN DESCRIBE LAURA'S PLEADING FACE WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THE SHADOW OF A RUINED CASTLE WOULDN'T AGREE WITH THE CASTLE ITSELF OR THAT A ROW OF POPLARS IN THE DISTANCE INSISTED ON TAKING THAT DIRECTION WHICH OUR TRANSATLANTIC BROTHERS CALL SLANTINDICULAR AND THEN THE CUTTING OF PENCILS AND CRUMBLING OF BREAD AND SEARCHING FOR MISLAID SCRAPS OF INDIA-RUBBER AND MIXING OF WATER-COLOURS AND ADJUSTING OF PALETTES ON THE PRETTIEST THUMB IN CHRISTENDOM OR THE PLANTING A SHEAF OF BRUSHES IN THE DEAREST LITTLE HAND THAT EVER TREMBLED WHEN IT MET THE TENDERLY TIMID TOUCH OF AN AMATEUR DRAWING-MASTER'S FINGERS;--ALL THESE LITTLE OFFICES SO COMMONPLACE AND WEARISOME WHEN A HARD-WORKED AND POORLY-PAID PROFESSOR PERFORMS THEM FOR THIRTY OR FORTY CLAMOROUS GIRLS ON A BURNING SUMMER AFTERNOON IN A GREAT DUST-FLAVOURED SCHOOLROOM WITH BARE CURTAINLESS WINDOWS WERE IN THIS CASE MORE DELICIOUS THAN ANY WORDS OF MINE CAN TELL
THE DAWN
LAURA WENT UP TO HER FATHER TO BID HIM GOOD-BYE
THE FIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN A FATHER AND DAUGHTER AFTER A SEPARATION OF SO MANY YEARS IS ALMOST SACRED IN ITS CHARACTER
THIS APPOINTMENT WOULD AFFORD THE CHANCE OF A NOBLE CAREER TO A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO SEIZE THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY WHICH MEDIOCRITY NEGLECTS BUT WHICH GENIUS MAKES THE STEPPING-STONE TO GREATNESS
AND AMONG THESE OTHER FACES HE SAW THE MANY SEMBLANCES WHICH HIS OWN HAD WORN
HE WAS APT TO LOOK DOUBTFULLY AT GENTLEMEN WITH ROOMY COAT-SLEEVES OR LADIES WITH LONG-HAIRED MUFFS OR FRINGED PARASOLS
LAURA DUNBAR GAVE A LONG DISCONTENTED SIGH AS SHE SEATED HERSELF AT HER FAVOURITE BAY-WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT AT THE DRIPPING TREES UPON THE LAWN BELOW
IS THAT HALL ASKED THE FOOTMAN SATIRICALLY
IF I'M RIGHT YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT WHAT I MEAN
O GOD HOW THAT FACE HAD CHANGED
AT HALF-PAST EIGHT THE DOVER MAIL WOULD LEAVE LONDON BRIDGE STATION
HE MADE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR BEARING OFF MR DUNBAR TO THE NEAREST HOTEL
IT MAY BE THAT THIS MAN COULD DISCOVER HIDDEN MEANINGS IN MARGARET'S WORDS--MEANINGS THAT ARE UTTERLY DARK TO ME
BUT I KNEW TOO WELL THAT IN ALL THE BLACKNESS OF HIS GUILT MARGARET WILMOT WOULD CLING TO HER FATHER AS TRULY AS TENDERLY AS SHE HAD CLUNG TO HIM IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WHEN THE SUSPICION OF HIS WORTHLESSNESS HAD BEEN ONLY A DARK SHADOW FOR EVER BROODING BETWEEN THE MAN AND HIS ONLY CHILD
LET THAT BE TAKEN TO THE YOUNG PERSON IN THE HALL HE SAID
THE CUR FORGOT THE TILL HE MUTTERED
BUT AS TO BRIGMAWL AT AN INQUEST HE'S ABOUT AS MUCH GOOD AS THE POPE OF ROME BUT WHY WAS BRIGMAWL EXAMINED IN PREFERENCE TO ANY ONE ELSE BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW MORE OF THE BUSINESS THAN ANY OF US BEING AS IT WAS HIM THAT TOOK THE ORDER FOR THE DINNER
BUT THEIRS WAS A SUBDUED AND QUIET HAPPINESS THAT HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE UPON THOSE AROUND THEM
IN THAT CASE I THINK WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND THERE'S NO OCCASION FOR ME TO STOP HERE ANY LONGER
THE COAT WAS DARK BLUE CLOTH OUTSIDE MR CARTER OPENED HIS POCKET-BOOK IN ORDER TO ADD ANOTHER MEMORANDUM TROUSERS AND WAISTCOAT SHEPHERD'S PLAID
UNABASHED AND NONCHALANT AS IF HE HAD BEEN STANDING IN A BALL-ROOM THE HERO OF THE HOUR THE ADMIRED OF ALL WHO LOOKED UPON HIM MR DUNBAR STOOD BEFORE THE CORONER AND JURY AND TOLD THE BROKEN HISTORY OF HIS OLD SERVANT'S DEATH
BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR NAME UP IF YOU WISH IT I SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL DO SO CERTAINLY MISS
HE SNATCHED UP THE BOTTLE AND GLASS POURED OUT SOME OF THE BRANDY AND PLACED IT BETWEEN HIS DAUGHTER'S LIPS
IT IS SUCH A NUISANCE TO WRITE MISS WENTWORTH--PRETTY VOICE EXPLAINING THE IMPORTANCE OF A STEADY POSITION OF THE WRIST OR THE DEXTEROUS TURNING OVER OR UNDER OF A THUMB OR SOMETHING EQUALLY INTERESTING
IT IS MY TURN NOW TO CONFIDE IN YOU
THE PRINCE OF DENMARK WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER A FIDGETY HUSBAND PERHAPS BUT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD RECOURSE TO A MURDEROUS BOLSTER AT THE INSTIGATION OF A LOW-BORN KNAVE
I SAW CLEMENT LEAVE THE GEORGE AND TAKE THE WAY TOWARDS THE CATHEDRAL
MONEY SEEMS SUCH A SMALL THING WHEN IT CANNOT BRING US THE PRESENCE OF THOSE WE LOVE
THE OUTER PART OF THE BUNDLE WAS A COAT--A CLOTH COAT KNAWED INTO TATTERS BY THE SHARP TEETH OF WATER-RATS
AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT IF A MAN'S LIFE WAS DESTINED TO BE MISERABLE WINCHESTER WOULD BE A NICE PLACE FOR HIM TO BE MISERABLE IN
I WATCHED HER AS SHE WALKED RAPIDLY ALONG THE NARROW STREET UNTIL SHE TURNED SHARPLY AWAY AT A CORNER AND DISAPPEARED
IT ISN'T LIKELY SHE'LL REMEMBER ME
JOSEPH WILMOT KNELT BESIDE THE STRICKEN MAN
THIS YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN A VERY GREAT FAVOURITE WITH PERCIVAL DUNBAR AND HAD BEEN A CONSTANT VISITOR AT THE ABBEY
I'LL TAKE IT MYSELF WITH THE BROWN-PAPER PARCEL--WHICH WAS A VERY BULKY ONE--UNDER HIS ARM JOSEPH WILMOT LEFT THE TAILOR'S SHOP AND WALKED DOWN TO AN OPEN PIER OR QUAY ABUTTING ON THE WATER
IT WAS NO TIME FOR CEREMONY
BUT THE WORLD SOON TOLD ME ANOTHER STORY
SHE HAD PASSED A WRETCHED NIGHT AT A HUMBLE INN A LITTLE WAY PUT OF THE TOWN AND HAD BEEN DREAMING ALL NIGHT OF HER MEETING WITH MR DUNBAR
HERE SHE TOLD HIM HER STORY
I WAS A FELON A GAOL-BIRD
WE WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER
THE CLOCK OF KYLMINGTON CHURCH WHICH WAS AS MUCH BEHIND ANY OTHER PUBLIC TIMEKEEPER I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED AS THE TOWN OF KYLMINGTON WAS BEHIND ANY OTHER TOWN I HAD EVER EXPLORED STRUCK EIGHT AS I OPENED THE LITTLE WOODEN GATE OF THE CHURCHYARD AND WENT INTO THE SHADE OF AN AVENUE OF STUNTED SYCAMORES WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CHIEF GLORY OF KYLMINGTON
I HAVE RECEIVED MY SENTENCE
I AM SUBJECT TO THESE FAINTING FITS HE SAID WITH A WAN SICKLY SMILE UPON HIS WHITE FACE
HE WAS EAGER TO SEE EVERYTHING AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF EVERYTHING
THE SCENE WAS GAY AND PLEASANT AS A RACE-GROUND ALWAYS MUST BE EVEN THOUGH IT WERE IN THE WILDEST REGIONS OF THE NEW WORLD
ALONE
AND I LINGER A LITTLE PERHAPS ASKING HIM ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND TRYING TO GET MORE AT HOME IN HIS PRESENCE
BUT NOW HE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING IN A NEW LIGHT
NOW IN ONE PLACE NOW IN ANOTHER
HE GOT UP AND WALKED TO THE WINDOW LEANING UPON HIS CANE AS HE WENT
I ALMOST HESITATE TO TELL THIS OLD OLD STORY OVER AGAIN--THIS PERPETUAL STORY OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
THERE WAS NO REPLY EXCEPT THE KNOCKING WHICH GREW LOUDER AND MORE HURRIED
THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT TENDED IN THE LEAST TO IMPLICATE HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN THE LAST PERSON SEEN IN COMPANY WITH THE DEAD MAN AND THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN HIS ASSERTION AND THAT OF THE VERGER RESPECTING THE TIME DURING WHICH HE HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM THE CATHEDRAL YARD
BUT WE ARE DOING ADMIRABLY SIR MR DAPHNEY CONCLUDED
MR DUNBAR MURDERED MY FATHER SHE SAID AFTER THIS HAD BEEN DONE
AND IF LAURA DUNBAR WAS A LITTLE PASSIONATE WHEN YOU TRIED TO THWART HER
IT IS THE WORK OF ONE OF MY FRIENDS
HE WAS A CHEERFUL OLD MAN AND LIFE SEEMED VERY PLEASANT TO HIM
SHUT THAT DOOR SIR HE SAID IMPATIENTLY TO THE CASHIER
I WILL PRAY GOD TO MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO FORGIVE YOU FAREWELL CLEMENT IF MY READERS HAVE SEEN MANFRED AT DRURY LANE LET THEM REMEMBER THE TONE IN WHICH MISS ROSE LECLERCQ BREATHED HER LAST FAREWELL TO MR PHELPS AND THEY WILL KNOW HOW MARGARET WILMOT PRONOUNCED THIS MOURNFUL WORD--LOVE'S FUNERAL BELL FAREWELL CLEMENT ONE WORD MISS WILMOT CRIED MR AUSTIN
I WENT BACK TO MY OLD POST BUT NOT TO REMAIN LONG IN MY OLD POSITION
BECAUSE MR DUNBAR AND THAT YOUNG GENT AS WAS WITH HIM WENT AWAY BAG AND BAGGAGE BY LAST NIGHT'S EXPRESS MARGARET WILMOT GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO EITHER SURPRISE OR INDIGNATION
BUT THEY HOPED IN VAIN
PRESENTLY HE STOPPED SUDDENLY WITH HIS ELBOW LEANING UPON THE CORNER OF THE MANTEL-PIECE OPPOSITE MARGARET AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL'S THOUGHTFUL FACE
I SUPPOSE THE SCIENCE OF DETECTION INCLUDES THE POWER TO GUESS AT THOUGHTS THAT LURK BEHIND EXPRESSIONS WHICH ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES
MR DUNBAR'S PORTRAIT MAY BE AMONGST THEM
DON'T BE TOO HARD UPON ME JOSEPH HE SAID WITH MILD REPROACHFULNESS
SOME WOMAN'S FANCY WHICH A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION WOULD SET AT REST
IF LAURA WANTED BRIDESMAIDS SHE MIGHT HAVE DORA MACMAHON AND ANY PARTICULAR FRIEND WHO LIVED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
I DO NOT SPEAK OF THIS BECAUSE I CARE FOR THE JEWELS
YOU INSIST ON DOING IT ALL YOURSELF I SHALL DO IT FOR LESS MONEY THAN A JEWELLER OH OF COURSE ANSWERED MAJOR VERNON
ONE BY ONE THE DEAD AND WOUNDED WERE EARNED AWAY FROM THE GREAT HEAP OF RUINS
THE DOOR WHICH BELONGED TO MR KERSTALL'S HOUSE OR RATHER THE HOUSE IN WHICH MR KERSTALL LIVED IN COMMON WITH A COLONY OF UNKNOWN NUMBER AND VARIOUS AVOCATIONS WAS OPEN AND SIR PHILIP AND HIS WIFE WENT INTO THE HALL
HIS HEAD WAS TURNED AWAY AND HE WAS BUSY MAKING SOME ALTERATION IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW
FASHIONABLE BUT SCRUPULOUSLY SIMPLE QUIET ALIKE IN COLOUR AND IN CUT
DO YOU REALLY NOW
SHE HAD THE DOG PLUTO WITH HER ALWAYS AND GENERALLY A VOLUME OF SOME NEW NOVEL UNDER HER ARM
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT A CHARACTER
WILLIAM BRIGMAWL HAS BEEN HEAD-WAITER IN THIS HOUSE NIGH UPON THIRTY YEAR
HOW MISERABLE WOULD BE THE ASPECT OF TWO ROWS OF DAMP CHARITY CHILDREN WITH RED NOSES AND NO POCKET-HANDKERCHIEFS
IF HE HAD BEEN A GOOD MAN I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD GRIEVE ME SO MUCH TO REMEMBER HIS CRUEL DEATH
MY DEAR MARGARET WHY DID YOU GET UP SO EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN YOU SO MUCH NEED REST THE GIRL ROSE AND LOOKED AT HER LOVER WITH A GRAVE AND QUIET EARNESTNESS OF EXPRESSION
HE WENT HE SAW LAURA DUNBAR AND SPENT HOUR AFTER HOUR IN HER SOCIETY
THE FOOTSTEP OF A PASSER-BY SOUNDED IN THE QUIET STREET ALMOST AS IT MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED IN THE SOLEMN CATHEDRAL AISLE
YOU CAN TELL HIM WHAT I DID WITH HIS GENEROUS GIFT THERE WAS ANOTHER BRIEF PAUSE
I READ ALL ABOUT THAT WINCHESTER BUSINESS IN THE SUNDAY PAPERS
TO POOR CLEMENT IT SEEMED AS IF THE SURGEON WAS ABSENT NEARLY AN HOUR SO INTOLERABLE WAS THE ANGUISH OF THAT INTERVAL OF SUSPENSE
IT WAS ONE OF THE OLDEST FIRMS IN THE CITY
IF SHE HAD GONE AWAY AT ALL SHE MUST HAVE GONE OUT BY ONE OF THE SMALLER GATES--BY THE LODGE-GATE UPON THE LISFORD ROAD PERHAPS AND THUS BACK TO SHORNCLIFFE
YOU'D BETTER GO AND DRESS
IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES BY THE MINUTE-HAND OF THE ONLY ONE OF THE ORMOLU CLOCKS WHICH MADE ANY PRETENCE OF GOING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AGAIN AND A BURLY-LOOKING MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN WITH A VERY BLACK BEARD AND A DIRTY HOLLAND BLOUSE ALL SMEARED WITH SMUDGES OF OIL-COLOUR APPEARED UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE ADJOINING CHAMBER SURROUNDED BY A CLOUD OF TOBACCO-SMOKE--LIKE A HEATHEN DEITY OR A GOOD-TEMPERED-LOOKING AFRICAN GENIE NEWLY ESCAPED FROM HIS BOTTLE
HE HAS SIR
FOR YOU SHALL NEVER BE SUFFERED TO LIVE AN HONEST LIFE OR HERD WITH HONEST PEOPLE
AND HEAVEN PRESERVE US FROM SUCH DEEDS AS MAKE OUR MEMORIES HIDEOUS TO US
THEIR MEETINGS WERE PURELY ACCIDENTAL OF COURSE AS SUCH MEETINGS ALWAYS ARE BUT THEY WERE NOT THE LESS PLEASANT BECAUSE OF THEIR UNCERTAINTY
TO BE SURE SIR TO BE SURE ANSWERED SAMPSON WILMOT
THE MURDERED MAN'S COFFIN WAS PLACED BESIDE THAT OF HIS FATHER AND A SIMPLE MARBLE TABLET RECORDING THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF HENRY DUNBAR CRUELLY AND TREACHEROUSLY ASSASSINATED IN A GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER WAS ERECTED BY ORDER OF LADY JOCELYN WHO WAS ABROAD WITH HER HUSBAND WHEN THE STORY OF HER FATHER'S DEATH WAS REVEALED TO HER
BUT IT WAS VERY QUIET AS COMPARED TO EPSOM DOWNS OR THE OPEN HEATH AT ASCOT
BUT I THOUGHT HIS HEART WOULD BE TRUE TO ME THROUGH ALL AND THAT EVEN IN HIS HARSHEST MOMENTS HE WOULD LOVE ME DEARLY FOR THE SAKE OF MY DEAD MOTHER HER VOICE BROKE AND SHE SOBBED ALOUD
THIS DECIDES IT HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
BUT HAVE A CARE HOW YOU TAMPER WITH OTHER MEN'S SIGNATURES FOR THE NEXT TIME YOU MAY NOT GET OFF SO EASILY THE LAD TOOK UP HIS HAT AND WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
AND FOR THIRTEEN YEARS I TOILED AMONGST THE WRETCHED GUILTY SLAVES IN NORFOLK ISLAND--THAT WAS THE FAVOURITE PLACE IN THOSE DAYS FOR SUCH AS ME--AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME MY CONDUCT HAVING BEEN APPROVED OF BY MY GAOLERS THE GOVERNOR SENT FOR ME GAVE ME A GOOD-SERVICE CERTIFICATE AND I WENT INTO A COUNTING-HOUSE AND SERVED AS A CLERK
THERE WERE COSTLY TOYS OF FRAGILE SEVRES CHINA THAT HAD BEEN RECEIVED BY ONE OF THE EARLS FROM THE HAND OF THE LOVELY POMPADOUR HERSELF IN THE DAYS WHEN THE MANUFACTURERS OF SEVRES ONLY WORKED FOR THEIR KING AND WERE LIABLE TO FALL A SACRIFICE TO THEIR ART AND THEIR LOYALTY BY THE INHALATION OF ARSENICATED VAPOURS
SHE HAD GROWN DURING THE HOMEWARD VOYAGE
AND HE MUST BE A MORAL BLONDIN IF HE EXPECTS TO WALK WITH ANY SAFETY UPON THE NARROW LINE WHICH ALONE DIVIDES HIM FROM THE GREAT ABYSS CALLED LOVE
YOU TOOK OUT A LETTER THREE TIMES WHILE WE WORE SITTING OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
YOU DON'T MEAN IT UNCLE HUGH
SOONER THAN BE TOOK UP FOR PERJURING I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING I THOUGHT SO SAID MR CARTER
BUT HOW COULD I TELL A DETECTIVE OFFICER MY DEAREST SECRET--THE SAD STORY OF MY ONLY LOVE
SAY FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR JOSEPH WILMOT REPEATED
THE GIRL'S EYES FILL SUDDENLY WITH TEARS AND SHE LEANS BACK IN THE CARRIAGE GLAD TO HIDE HER HAPPY FACE FROM THE CROWD
THE HORSE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH A RUG UPON HIS BACK AND HIS NOSE IN A BAG OF OATS
WELL SIR THE YOUNG LADY,'--MR CARTER CALLED MARGARET A YOUNG LADY THIS TIME AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT HER LETTER HAD REVEALED HER TO HIM AS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM THE ORDINARY CLASS OF FEMALE POPULARLY DESCRIBED AS A YOUNG WOMAN,--'THE YOUNG LADY WAS IN EARNEST WHEN SHE WROTE THAT LETTER SIR HE SAID
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE HAD THOUGHT OF THE BUNDLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM ONLY TO LAUGH AT THE WONDROUS SCIENCE OF DISCOVERY WHICH HAD SLUNK BACK BAFFLED BY SO SLIGHT A MYSTERY ONLY TO FANCY THE WATER-RATS GNAWING THE DEAD MAN'S GARMENTS AND ALL THE OOSE AND SLIME CREEPING IN AND OUT AMONGST THE FOLDS UNTIL THE ROTTING RAGS BECAME A VERY PART OF THE RANK RIVER-WEEDS THAT CRAWLED AND TANGLED ROUND THEM
IT'S FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO,--FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS MONTH SINCE IT ALL HAPPENED
AND YOU'VE SEEN RUIN OVERTAKE ME WHICHEVER WAY I'VE TURNED
WHY THEN DID HE NOT PROPOSE
SHE HURRIED TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND LED HIM OFF TO LOOK AT THE PICTURE
YOU WATCH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD I'LL WATCH THE RIGHT CLEMENT SAID
DEATH HAD CLOSED THE LIPS OF THIS WITNESS
MARGARET WILMOT HAD GONE TO FORCE HERSELF INTO THIS MAN'S PRESENCE IN SPITE OF HIS REITERATED REFUSAL TO SEE HER
I MUST GO BY THIS TRAIN OR I SHALL LOSE A DAY
I THINK MR DUNBAR WAS AWAY AN HOUR ARTHUR LOVELL GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START
PERHAPS AFTER ALL I ONLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS GIRL BECAUSE SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO LONELY AND BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF MYSTERY THERE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT HER LIFE NEVER FOR ONE MOMENT HAD CLEMENT AUSTIN SUSPECTED THAT THIS MYSTERY INVOLVED ANYTHING DISCREDITABLE TO MARGARET HERSELF
HE HEARD THE HOBNAILED SOLES OF THE CHARITY CHILDREN PATTERING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHURCH
WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SLIP QUIETLY PAST THIS MAN AND WALK STRAIGHT TO THE APARTMENTS OF MR DUNBAR UNQUESTIONED UNINTERRUPTED
THE SURGEON KNEW IT AND THOUGHT HIS GOOD ANGEL HAD SENT THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT ACROSS HIS PATHWAY
WE'LL TAKE A STROLL TOWARDS ST CROSS AND GET AN APPETITE FOR DINNER MR DUNBAR SAID AS HE AND HIS COMPANION WALKED ALONG A PATHWAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MOSS-GROWN WALL ACROSS A PATCH OF MEADOW-LAND AND AWAY INTO THE HOLY QUIET OF A GROVE
BITTER FEELINGS DIE OUT OF A MAN'S BREAST AS THE YEARS ROLL BY--DON'T THEY JOSEPH
I ASKED HIM WHY HE WANTED THEM AND WHAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE GAINED BY THE FINDING OF THEM BUT HE ONLY NODDED HIS HEAD SIGNIFICANTLY AND TOLD ME TO WAIT
GET UP AND TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER MARGARET WILMOT ROSE FROM HER KNEES SHUDDERING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER TRYING TO BE CALM--TRYING TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS
MR CARTER TOLD HIS ASSISTANT VERY BRIEFLY THAT HE'D BEEN WASTING HIS TIME AND TROUBLE ON A FALSE TRACK AND THAT HE SHOULD GIVE THE MATTER UP
THAT SIGNATURE MUST BE HONOURED THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE TO SACRIFICE HALF MY FORTUNE TO MEET THE DEMANDS UPON US
THE DILAPIDATED BOOTS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR STOUT WATER-TIGHT WELLINGTONS
AND AS FAR AS MY CONSENT GOES YOU MAY HAVE IT TO-MORROW IF YOU LIKE
IT'S PAST NINE O'CLOCK AND YOU'RE TO BE AT THE CHURCH AT ELEVEN AND PAPA IS TO GIVE ME AWAY MURMURED LAURA IN A LOW VOICE AS SHE SEATED HERSELF BEFORE THE DRESSING-TABLE
THERE WAS ONLY ONE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN THE FIRST-CLASS CARRIAGE IN WHICH MARGARET WILMOT TOOK HER SEAT WHEN THE BRANCH TRAIN FOR SHORNCLIFFE WAS READY
BUT SURELY SUCH A CONSPIRACY MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE I SAID BY-AND-BY
BUT POOR LAURA LOOKED IN VAIN FOR THE FACE SHE WANTED TO SEE--THE HARD COLD FACE AS SHE FANCIED IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN YOUTH
MAY WE SEE THE PICTURES SHE ASKED
MAN AND WOMAN STANDING IN MOURNFUL SILENCE BY YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATHBED
AND THE MAJOR WAS ABLE TO LIVE UPON THE BEST THE ROSE AND CROWN COULD AFFORD AND PAY LIBERALLY FOR ALL HE CONSUMED
NOW THEN SAID MR CARTER TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND LOOK SHARP WELL I WAS WAITIN IN THE SHORNCLIFFE TICKET-OFFIS AND ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER TWO IN COMES THE GENT AS LARGE AS LIFE AND I SEES HIM TAKE HIS TICKET AND I HEARS HIM SAY DERBY ON WHICH I WAITS TILL HE'S OUT OF THE OFFIS AND I TAKES MY OWN TICKET SAME PLACE
I'M AN OLD MAN AND I'VE SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF THE WAYS OF THIS WORLD AND I'VE FOUND THAT RETRIBUTION SELDOM FAILS TO OVERTAKE THOSE WHO DO WRONG MR BALDERBY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
HE SAT BY THE BROAD FIREPLACE WATCHING THE BURNING COALS AND WAITING UNTIL HE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TO TAKE HIS PLACE BY HIS DAUGHTER'S SIDE IN THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO CONVEY THEM BOTH TO LISFORD CHURCH
I WAS SOOTHED SOMEHOW OR OTHER BY THE PECULIAR QUIET OF THE SCENE
I DID NOT THINK A SOLICITOR'S SON WOULD BE WEAK ENOUGH TO INDULGE IN ANY SILLY SENTIMENTALITY
FOR THE PRESENT MARGARET WAS LOST TO ME
THE SUITE OF APARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY PERCIVAL DUNBAR COMPRISED THE GREATER PART OF THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE
THE BANKER HAD FAINTED
THE WEATHER WAS BLEAK AND WINDY AND THERE WERE VERY FEW WANDERERS IN THE HILLY HIGH STREET OF WINCHESTER
BUT CLEMENT AUSTIN DID NOT BESTOW SO MUCH AS ONE GLANCE UPON THE BREAKFAST-TABLE
MOST RESOLUTELY AND AFTER THAT INTERVIEW THE YOUNG LADY CHANGED HER OPINION ALL OF A SUDDEN AND WOULD HAVE IT THAT THE BANKER WAS INNOCENT ASKED MR CARTER
EARLY THE NEXT DAY CLEMENT AUSTIN WALKED TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY IN ORDER TO PROCURE ALL THE INFORMATION LIKELY TO FACILITATE MARGARET WILMOT'S GRAND PURPOSE
HENRY DUNBAR WORE A FASHIONABLE GREATCOAT WITH LOOSE OPEN CUFFS AND IT WAS TOWARDS THESE LOOSE CUFFS THAT MR HARTGOLD'S EYES WANDERED WITH RAPID AND RATHER UNEASY GLANCES
DID HE DANCE
MARGARET'S LETTER
I MEAN THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE YOU MUST FIND GREAT IMPROVEMENTS
AT JOCELYN'S ROCK THE STAMP OF AGE WAS UPON EVERY DECORATION ON EVERY ORNAMENT
I HAD NEVER BEEN IN WINCHESTER BEFORE AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE QUAINT OLD HOUSES THE TOWERING CATHEDRAL THE FLAT MEADOWS AND WINDING STREAMS OF WATER RIPPLED BY THE WIND
I--I--WISH TO HEAR OF THIS
DAY AFTER DAY HE LIVED SECLUDED AND ALONE
WHAT IF IT SHOULD NOT REACH RUGBY UNTIL AFTER THE LONDON EXPRESS HAD LEFT THE STATION
BUT WHEN MARGARET PLAYED AND SANG PEOPLE WERE CHARMED IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT'S AT ALL INCONVENIENT THAT IS TO SAY NOT TO ME BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL THINK IT AN OBJECTION I EAGERLY ASKED THE NATURE OF THIS OBJECTION
I TURNED UP JOSEPH WILMOT'S OWN HISTORY WHILE I WAS MAKING MYSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE DETAILS OF THIS MURDER
YES MR JAKINS'S SUCCESSOR TOLD ME THERE WERE TWO MUSIC-MISTRESSES IN THE TOWN--ONE WAS MADAME CARINDA WHO TAUGHT AT GROVE HOUSE THE FASHIONABLE LADIES SCHOOL
THE HOUSE WAS BUILT ENTIRELY OF STONE
IT'S WELL TO BE RICH SIR IT IS INDEED
THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO
ASK GOD TO BLESS ME FATHER DEAREST THE SOFT TREMULOUS VOICE PLEADED FOR THE SAKE OF MY DEAD MOTHER SHE TRIED TO SEE HIS FACE
WHY DID YOU DO THIS CRUEL THING I WILL TELL YOU WHY THE GIRL ANSWERED SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY
REMEMBER THIS AND KEEP THE SECRET OF THAT PAINFUL STORY ARTHUR LOVELL'S FACE GREW TERRIBLY GRAVE AS HE READ THESE LINES
THOUGH AMANDA'S BLACK EYES GLITTERED LIKE THE STARS IN A MIDNIGHT SKY
HIS DAUGHTER I SUPPOSE
THE MURDERER OF MY FATHER SHE THOUGHT
BUT THE OFFICES WERE WELL LIGHTED BY LOFTY PLATE-GLASS WINDOWS
WHOSE ATMOSPHERE HAD SEEMED MORE SUFFOCATING THAN THE FOETID VAPOURS OF A FEVER-TAINTED DEN IN ST GILES'S
THE ELECTRA IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON THE NINETEENTH HE SAID IN A LOW THOUGHTFUL VOICE ON OR ABOUT THE NINETEENTH
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THESE STREAMS SO DANGEROUS FOR BATHING
I DOUBT IF WE SHALL BE JUSTIFIED IN SETTING THE LEG TO-NIGHT
THE SPARKLING BUBBLES HAD VANISHED FROM THE CLEAR AMBER WINE
GO BACK AND GET ME MY COAT HE SAID TO MARGARET
HAVE THEY NOT PUT THEIR MONEY UPON HIM AND ARE THEY NOT PROUD OF HIM?--PROUD OF HIS HANDSOME FACE WHICH AMID ALL ITS EASY GOOD-NATURE HAS A CERTAIN DASH OF HAUTEUR THAT BEFITS ONE WHO HAS A SPRINKLING OF THE BLOOD OF SAXON KINGS IN HIS VEINS
I LEAVE HER IN YOUR HANDS MOTHER HE SAID
IT WAS CLEMENT WHO HAD INFORMED MARGARET OF MR DUNBAR'S EXPECTED PRESENCE HERE UPON THIS DAY
A WOMAN'S INSTINCT IS SOMETIMES WORTH MORE THAN A MAN'S WISDOM
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED MADGE AND WHAT I MIGHT HAVE HAD PERHAPS IF CLEM HADN'T BEEN WISER THAN HIS SILLY OLD MOTHER
THE CRUTCHES--THEY WERE MADE OF SOME LIGHT POLISHED WOOD AND WERE TRIUMPHS OF ART IN THEIR WAY--LEANED AGAINST A TABLE CLOSE TO THE COUCH AND WITHIN REACH TO THE MAN'S HAND
SURELY I AM NOT SO SILLY AS TO HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED BY HAZEL EYES AND A STRAIGHT NOSE
THE INNER GARMENT--THE FLANNEL SHIRT--WAS IN A VERY TOLERABLE STATE OF PRESERVATION
REMEMBER HE IS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY
GOOD NIGHT
AND HIS HANDS TREMBLED EH ASKED THE DETECTIVE
I AM AN OLD MAN AND I HAVE BEEN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS IN INDIA
AND THEY DO SAY SIR AS MR DUNBAR MUST HAVE BEEN TOOK MAD ALL OF A SUDDEN AND THE DOCTOR WAS IN AN AWFUL WAY WHEN HE HEARD IT
HE HEARD THE SHARP RUSTLING OF THE EVERGREENS AND WET FLOWERS UNDER THE CHILDREN'S FIGURES
NOTHING OF THAT SORT IN MY DAY
YOU CAN COME WITH ME IF YOU LIKE MR CARTER ANSWERED
BUT SHE NEVER WITHDREW HER EYES FROM CLEMENT'S FACE AND HER GLANCE NEVER FALTERED AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM
AND HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
HIS HEALTH HAD BEEN VERY FEEBLE EVER SINCE THE SECOND SHOCK OF PARALYSIS--THAT DIRE AND SILENT FOE WHOSE INVISIBLE HAND HAD STRICKEN THE OLD MAN DOWN AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S WARNING
YOU REALLY MIGHT KNOCK ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER MISS
THINK OF THE HIDEOUS STATE OF THE CRIMINAL'S MIND AFTER THE DEED IS DONE
THEY WENT INTO THE LONG ARCADE BENEATH THE OVER-ARCHING TREES AND THE SOMBRE SHADOWS CLOSED ABOUT THEM AND HID THEM FROM THE WORLD
AND THAT EVEN THE BROOK WHICH RIPPLED THROUGH YOUR BOYISH DREAMS AS YOU LAY ASLEEP AMONGST THE RUSHES ON ITS BRINK HAS DRIED UP FOR EVER
MISS DUNBAR HAD SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE IN THE LOW EASY-CHAIR BY THE WINDOW
YES SIR HE IS VERY MUCH FATIGUED BY YESTERDAY'S BUSINESS AND HE DECLINES TO SEE YOU
THE DEED HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DONE BY SOME SAVAGE WRETCH SOME LOST AND IGNORANT CREATURE HARDENED BY A LONG LIFE OF CRIME AND PREYING LIKE A WILD BEAST UPON HIS FELLOW-MEN
HE MADE NO MENTION OF THAT SUDDEN FAINTNESS WHICH HAD SEIZED UPON THE ANGLO-INDIAN AT THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE CHAPELS
THE BANKER WRITHED UNDER THE TOUCH OF HIS INDIAN ACQUAINTANCE
AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER I HAVE NEVER FOUND MYSELF IN ANY WAY BORED BY NON PIU MESTA OR EVEN THE MAJOR AND MINOR SCALES WHICH AS INTERPRETED BY A JUVENILE PERFORMER ARE NOT ESPECIALLY ENTHRALLING TO THE EAR OF THE ORDINARY LISTENER
THE OLD MAN BRIGHTENED UP AS MUCH AS HIS PAINTINGS AND BEGAN PRESENTLY TO CALL OUT THE NAMES OF THE SUBJECTS
AFTER DOING THIS HE LOST NO TIME IN RE-CROSSING THE WATER AGAIN AND LANDED ON THE YORKSHIRE SIDE OF THE HUMBER AS THE CLOCKS OF HULL WERE STRIKING FOUR
TELL HER THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL WILL DETAIN ME IN WINCHESTER FOR A WEEK
THERE IS NOTHING IN ALL THE WORLD FOR ME EXCEPT THE HOPE OF GOD'S FORGIVENESS FOR YOU
THE SAME DESPATCH-BOX WHOSE CONTENTS HE HAD SO CAREFULLY STUDIED AT THE WINCHESTER HOTEL UPON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER IN THE GROVE
I DON'T HE SAID NO MORE BUT SAT SILENT WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED OVER HIS BREAST
A NEW EXISTENCE HAS BEGUN FOR HER AS WIFE AND MOTHER
REPENT AND WE WILL LAUGH AT YOUR PENITENCE AS A SHALLOW DECEPTION
BUT CLEMENT LIKED THE STEADY LIGHT OF HIS SMALL GREY EYES AND THE DECIDED EXPRESSION OF HIS THIN LIPS AND PROMINENT CHIN
THE LONDON TRAIN REACHED SHORNCLIFFE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
HE GAVE THE TWO YOUNG FISHERMEN THE PROMISED FIVE-POUND NOTE AND LEFT THEM VERY WELL CONTENTED WITH THEIR NIGHT'S WORK INGLORIOUS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN
I DIDN'T SEE THAT HE WAS LAME HE SAID
BUT NO VESTIGE OF THE DEAD MAN'S GARMENTS HAD BEEN FOUND
THE VOLUMINOUS CURTAINS THAT SHELTERED THE WINDOWS AND SHROUDED THE CARVED ROSEWOOD FOUR-POST BED WERE OF A DARK GREEN WHICH LOOKED BLACK IN THE DIM LIGHT
THEREFORE I SHOULD THINK WE MAY BE ABLE TO PLAN AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU AND HIM
IT SEEMS AS IF THE SPIRIT OF THE MURDERED MAN TROUBLED OUR LIVES AND CRIED TO US FOR VENGEANCE CLEMENT THOUGHT
BUT I DON'T LIKE SECRETS CLEM
SHE HELD THE FOLDED NEWSPAPER CLUTCHED TIGHTLY AGAINST HER BREAST
THE DEFIANT SNEER WAS CHANGED INTO A HAUGHTY SMILE
IT WILL BE ONLY WISE TO DENY ME
HE TOOK NOTHING BUT A CUP OF STRONG TEA AND A FEW MOUTHFULS OF DRY TOAST AND THEN PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT
POVERTY MUST INDEED BE A BITTER SCHOOL IF IT HAS PREPARED YOU FOR SUCH DEGRADATION AS THIS THE LONGER CLEMENT THOUGHT OF THE SUBJECT THE MORE CERTAINLY HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT MARGARET WILMOT HAD BEEN EITHER BRIBED OR FRIGHTENED INTO SILENCE BY HENRY DUNBAR
I'LL GO TO A BARBER'S AND GET THAT DONE AND IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MIND EASY ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF THESE GENTLEMEN HE HANDED THE TRADESMAN THREE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES
AND WENT OFF TO INDIA PROMISING TO SEND ME A BILL OF EXCHANGE FOR THE BALANCE BY THE NEXT MAIL
THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO DO SO MOTHER
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU ARE ILL HE WAS ILL
THE DUTY OF TEACHING A WICKED MAN TO REPENT OF HIS SINS
BUT LOR
BUT THE GRINNING FACE OF THE MAJOR THE THIN LIPS WREATHED INTO A MALICIOUS SMILE THE SMALL BLACK EYES GLITTERING WITH A SINISTER LIGHT LOOKED LIKE THE FACE OF A MEPHISTOPHELES
AND MISS DUNBAR HAD WALKED UPON VELVET PILE AND SLEPT BENEATH THE SHADOW OF SATIN CURTAINS FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD OF HER EXISTENCE
ARTHUR LOVELL WENT WITH THEM
BUT AS IT GREW DUSK I VENTURED NEARER AND FOUND OUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THAT THEY HAD NOT FOUND WHAT THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR
SHE TOOK MY HANDS AND PRESSED THEM TO HER POOR PALE LIPS AND THEN HURRIED AWAY SO CHANGED FROM THE BRIGHT MARGARET OF THE PAST THAT A DREADFUL THOUGHT TOOK POSSESSION OF MY MIND AND I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE WAS MAD THE LETTER WENT ON TO SPEAK OF OTHER THINGS
THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN YOU WOULD REGRET YOUR CHOICE
HE MAY COMMIT ANY CRIME IN THE CALENDAR SO LONG AS HIS CRIMES ARE PROFITABLE AND HE IS CONTENT TO SHARE HIS PROFITS WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS
MY PLAN IS TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
JOSEPH--JOSEPH SAID SAMPSON HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU AFTER MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS SEPARATION AND ANY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU OUT OF MY SLENDER MEANS I'LL GIVE FREELY--I WILL INDEED JOSEPH FOR THE MEMORY OF OUR DEAR MOTHER IF NOT FOR LOVE OF YOU
I AM TIRED OF LIVING AT MAUDESLEY AND I WANT TO GET AWAY TO THE CONTINENT
THE TONE OF HER VOICE WOULD HAVE HELPED TO SOME SLIGHT DIAGNOSIS OF HER STATE
THERE WAS PHILIP JOCELYN'S START OF GLAD ASTONISHMENT AND THE BRIGHT SPARKLE IN HIS DARK-BROWN EYES AS HE SAW THE SLENDER QUEENLY FIGURE APPROACHING HIM UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE TREES
BUT IT WAS A NOBLE MANSION NOTWITHSTANDING
HE GOES AND TUMBLES BACK'ARDS INTO THE WATER RATHER THAN LET ME HAVE ANY ADVANTAGE OUT OF HIM THERE WAS NOTHING FOR MR CARTER TO DO BUT TO GO STRAIGHT BACK TO LISFORD AND TRY HIS LUCK AGAIN WITH EVERYTHING AGAINST HIM
TELL ME HIS NAME FATHER SHE REPEATED IMPATIENTLY
IN THE FIRM ARISTOCRATIC HANDWRITING THAT WAS SO FAMILIAR TO THE CHIEF CLERKS IN THE BANKING-HOUSE
BUT WHAT'S A LITTLE RAIN MORE OR LESS TO YOU MISS LAURA WHEN YOU'VE GOT MORE CARRIAGES TO RIDE IN THAN IF YOU WAS A PRINCESS IN A FAIRY TALE WHICH I THINK THE PRINCESS BALTROUBADORE OR WHATEVER HER HARD NAME WAS IN THE STORY OF ALADDIN MUST HAVE HAD NO CARRIAGE WHATEVER OR SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE WALKIN TO THE BATHS
HE HIMSELF LEFT WINCHESTER UPON ANOTHER ERRAND
BUT NO MORE
THEY WALKED UNDER THE SHADOW OF A LOW STONE COLONNADE AND THEN TURNED ASIDE BY THE MARKET-PLACE AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE PRECINCTS OF THE CATHEDRAL
WHEN YOU BLUSHED YOUR BLUSHES WERE THE SIMULATED BLUSHES OF A PROFESSED COQUETTE
THERE'S AN ENGINE COMING HE NEVER FINISHED HIS SENTENCE
WHO COULD HELP LOVING YOU
THE DRAUGHT MR VINCENT HAD SPOKEN OF AS A SEDATIVE TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY POWERFUL OPIATE AND MARGARET SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLUMBER ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER TAKING THE MEDICINE
MY FRIEND CARRIES IT WITH A HIGH HAND AT PRESENT
THIS ARTIST NEVER RETURNED FROM ITALY AND PERCIVAL DUNBAR COULD NEVER FIND OUT HIS WHEREABOUTS OR WHETHER HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE
AND PEOPLE LOOKED WITH INTEREST AT THAT PALE FACE KEEPING SUCH ANXIOUS WATCH AT THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW
HERE HE APPLIED IMMEDIATELY TO THE STATION-MASTER FROM WHOM HE GOT ANOTHER LITTLE NOTE DIRECTED TO HIM BY MR TIBBLES AND VERY MUCH RESEMBLING THAT WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED AT SHORNCLIFFE
TO THE MIND OF SIR ARDEN WESTHORPE THE AGITATION DISPLAYED BY HENRY DUNBAR IN THE CATHEDRAL WAS A VERY STRONG POINT
AND UPON THIS JULY EVENING THERE SEEMED TO BE FLOWERS BLOOMING IN EVERY CASEMENT
THE DRAUGHT FROM THE PASSAGE IS STRONG ENOUGH TO CUT A MAN IN TWO
MARGARET MY PEARL
AS SHE WENT AWAY THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY A FLEECY GREY CLOUD AND THE STREET WAS WRAPPED IN SHADOW
I'VE GOT HIM SHOUTED THE VOICE OF THE FISHERMAN
AND IT WASN'T VERY DIFFICULT TO GUESS THAT THE LETTER HAD SOME BEARING UPON THE BUSINESS THAT HAS BROUGHT US TO WINCHESTER MR CARTER PAUSED AND SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE CHIMNEY-PIECE
WHY DIDN'T YOU LOOK AFTER THE GENTLEMAN WHO STAYED AT HOME
IF YOU LOVE HER AND SHE RETURNS YOUR LOVE MARRY HER AND SHE SHALL HAVE A DOWRY THAT NO GENTLEMAN'S WIFE NEED BE ASHAMED TO BRING TO HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NO ANGER NO IMPATIENCE IN THE BANKER'S VOICE NOW BUT A TONE OF DEEP FEELING
AFTER OFFICE HOURS IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
IT WAS A PEASANT-GIRL'S HEAD VERY EXQUISITELY PAINTED BY A MODERN ARTIST AND THE BARONET APPROVED HIS WIFE'S TASTE
HOW WILL YOU MANAGE FOR MONEY WHERE YOU ART GOING OH I SHALL MANAGE VERY WELL HE HAD GOT INTO THE SADDLE BY THIS TIME NOT WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD COME TO-DAY SHE RAN TO HIM AND FELL UPON HIS BREAST HALF-WEEPING HALF-LAUGHING
MY NEW LIFE WAS SMOOTH ENOUGH AND THERE WAS SO MUCH BUSINESS TO BE GOT THROUGH SO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY VESTED IN MY HANDS--FOR MR BALDERBY WAS GETTING FAT AND LAZY AS REGARDED AFFAIRS IN THE CITY THOUGH UNTIRING IN THE PRODUCTION OF MORE FORCED PINE-APPLES AND HOTHOUSE GRAPES THAN HE COULD CONSUME OR GIVE AWAY--THAT I HAD NOT MUCH LEISURE IN WHICH TO THINK OF THE ONE SORROW OF MY LIFE
HAD I NOT BEEN CHARMED WITH HER ALREADY?)--'WHEN YOU HEAR HER PLAY FOR SHE HAS EXPRESSION AS WELL AS BRILLIANCY
HE IS A FRIEND OF MY FATHER'S AND HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME--INDEED HE OFFERED ME AN APPOINTMENT WHICH I FOUND IT WISEST TO DECLINE
SHE FORGOT THAT I WAS WAITING FOR HER PERHAPS CLEMENT THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
AND IF THE PICTURES ARE HORRIBLE IF HE SHUDDERS AS HE LOOKS AT THEM IF THE SIGHT OF THEM IS WORSE THAN THE PAIN OF DEATH TO HIM HE MUST LOOK NEVERTHELESS
MARGARET WENTWORTH BOWED HER HEAD UPON HER KNEES AND SOBBED ALOUD
AND IF HE EVER DID GET A CHANCE IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM BEFORE THE SINCERITY OF ANY APPARENT REFORMATION HAD BEEN TESTED
TO THINK THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF EVERY NOW AND THEN
AS HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS THIS IS THE TRUTH AND I KNOW IT TO BE THE TRUTH
BUT NO
SHE KNEW THAT ONLY ONE MOTIVE COULD LEAD ME TO THAT PLACE
HERE HE HAD HIS BEARD SHAVED OFF HIS RAGGED MOUSTACHE TRIMMED INTO THE MOST ARISTOCRATIC SHAPE AND HIS LONG STRAGGLING GREY HAIR CUT AND ARRANGED ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DIRECTIONS
THERE WERE VERY STRONG REASONS WHY JOSEPH WILMOT A VAGABOND AND A RETURNED CRIMINAL SHOULD MURDER HIS LATE MASTER IF BY SO DOING HE COULD TAKE THE DEAD MAN'S PLACE AND SLIP FROM THE POSITION OF AN OUTCAST AND A PENNILESS REPROBATE INTO THAT OF CHIEF PARTNER IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR AND COMPANY
I REMEMBER--AH AS LONG AGO AS FORTY YEARS AND MORE--WHEN I WAS A BIT OF A BOY IN PINAFORES THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN MURDERED ON THE TWYFORD ROAD AND THEY DID SAY BUT MR DUNBAR WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO LISTEN TO THE LANDLORD'S REMINISCENCES
PHILIP JOCELYN EXPLAINED HIS BUSINESS AND TOLD THE PAINTER HOW MORE THAN FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE PORTRAIT OF HENRY DUNBAR ONLY SON OF PERCIVAL DUNBAR THE GREAT BANKER HAD BEEN PAINTED BY MR MICHAEL KERSTALL AT THAT TIME A FASHIONABLE ARTIST
DO YOU REMEMBER THE HALF-SHEET OF PAPER I FOUND ON A BLOTTING-PAD IN THE COUNTING-HOUSE ONE DAY
AND HE SENT ME TO CALL UP MASTER AND MASTER HELPED HIM OFF THE HORSE AND TOOK THE HORSE TO THE STABLE
AND I WAS WORSE THAN POOR AND DESOLATE FOR THE STAIN OF MY FATHER'S SHAMEFUL HISTORY BLACKENED MY NAME
I SHAN'T GO AT THE SUBJECT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT AT ONCE
I AM THINKING THAT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT LOVE ME NOT LOVE YOU LAURA
MISS ELIZABETH LESTER BECAME A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY UPON THE FIRST OF JULY AND HAS SINCE THAT TIME CONTINUED TO MAKE HERSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH MY MOTHER AND MYSELF
NO I WON'T SEE THE COTTAGE TO-NIGHT
THE DAY WAS BRIGHT AND CLEAR AND THERE WAS NO LACK OF LIGHT THEREFORE UPON THE PORTRAITS
COULDN'T YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE LONGER
HOWEVER HE HAS BEEN SUSPECTED AND SOME STUPID COUNTRY MAGISTRATE ACTUALLY HAD HIM ARRESTED
THERE WAS A LOW IRON GATE LEADING OUT OF THE QUADRANGLE INTO THE GROUNDS
AND IN THREE MINUTES TIME OUT I GOES MAKIN AS SURE TO FIND HIM IN THE BAR AS I MAKE SURE OF YOUR BEIN CLOSE BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT
THE DOORS WERE OPEN AND THROUGH TWO OR THREE INTERMEDIATE ROOMS THE MAJOR SAW THE TAPESTRIED CHAMBER DARK AND EMPTY
YOU COME FROM THE BANKING-HOUSE I SUPPOSE YES THE DETECTIVE ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE YES LADY JOCELYN I COME FROM THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE MR CARTER WAS SILENT FOR SOME FEW MOMENTS DURING WHICH HIS EYES WANDERED ABOUT THE APARTMENT IN THAT PROFESSIONAL SURVEY WHICH TOOK IN EVERY DETAIL FROM THE COLOUR OF THE CURTAINS AND THE PATTERN OF THE CARPETS TO THE TINIEST PORCELAIN TOY IN AN ANTIQUE CABINET ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE
BUT I NEVER NEVER THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT LOVE ME
THE WIT OF THE PARTY FORGETS HIS BEST ANECDOTE
ARTHUR LOVELL WATCHING THE CASE IN THE INTERESTS OF MR DUNBAR ASKED SEVERAL QUESTIONS OF THE WITNESSES
AND IF SO AT WHAT TIME HE WAS THERE AND AT WHAT HOUR HE LEFT
QUITE DEAD
MR DUNBAR MAY HAVE BEEN UNAWARE OF MY EXISTENCE UNTIL THIS MOMENT
THE ABSENCE OF JOSEPH WILMOT BECAME EVERY MOMENT MORE UNACCOUNTABLE
HER EYES ARE OF THAT RARE HAZEL THAT SOFT GOLDEN BROWN SO RARELY SEEN SO BEAUTIFUL WHEREVER THEY ARE SEEN
YOU WANT TO SEE MR DUNBAR HE SAID
BUT IT'S A LONG TIME AGO JOSEPH--IT'S A VERY VERY LONG TIME AGO
CHAPTER XX
HUMPH!--HA!--AH YES MUTTERED THE DETECTIVE BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HE HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND ON A TABLE NEAR HIS ELBOW WERE ARRANGED THE OPEN DESPATCH-BOX A TALL CRYSTAL JUG OF BURGUNDY WITH A GOBLET-SHAPED GLASS ON A SALVER AND A CASE OF CIGARS
AN HOUR PASSED BY AND HE HAD NOT YET SPOKEN
AND I WOULD GIVE MUCH--AH MISS WENTWORTH YOU CANNOT GUESS HOW MUCH!--IF I COULD BE OF HELP TO YOU IN ANY TIME OF GRIEF OR TROUBLE
SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS THE GATE WAS OPENED
YOU SEEM VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS MISSING GENTLEMAN
YOU'LL NEVER FIND YOUR WAY BY YOURSELF
A NICE EXCUSE FOR SLINKING YOUR WORK EH MY GIRL
OF COURSE THE LOQUACIOUS BEADLE TALKED CHIEFLY OF SIR PHILIP JOCELYN AND THE BANKER'S DAUGHTER
MY POOR MARGARET I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE HATED THAT MAN SO MUCH IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE THOUGHT OF YOU--YOUR LONELY GIRLHOOD--YOUR HOPELESS JOYLESS EXISTENCE--AND ALL THROUGH HIM--ALL THROUGH THE MAN WHO RUINED ME AT THE OUTSET OF MY LIFE
NANTE DINARI NANTE MANJARE AS WE SAY IN THE CLASSICS WHICH I TRANSLATE NO CREDIT AT THE BUTCHER'S OR THE BAKER'S FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE STOP THAT ABOMINABLE SLANG SAID HENRY DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY
HOW MANY--TO WHAT AMOUNT THREE THOUSAND POUNDS THE CORNET REPLIED HANGING HIS HEAD
WHY DID YOU DO THIS MARGARET CLEMENT ASKED AT LAST IN A HEART-RENDING VOICE
PHILIP KNOCKED AND AFTER A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL THE DOOR WAS OPENED BY ANOTHER OLD WOMAN TIDIER AND CLEANER THAN THE OLD WOMEN WHO PERVADED THE YARD BUT LOOKING VERY LIKE A NEAR RELATION TO THOSE LADIES
MARGARET WILMOT HAD PROMISED TO BECOME THE WIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
AND I WENT AFTER HIM AND FOUND OUT WHERE HE WAS--AT THE INN WHERE YOU STAYED WHERE YOU REFUSED TO SEE ME--AND THAT THERE WAS A MAN WITH HIM
SO I SUPPOSE I MUST SAY YES
THERE WAS A DOOR UNDER THIS ARCHWAY AND THERE WAS A YARD BEYOND IT WITH THE DOOR OF ANOTHER HOUSE OPENING UPON IT AND RANGES OF BLACK CURTAINLESS WINDOWS LOOKING DOWN UPON IT AND AN AIR OF DRIED HERBS GREEN-STUFF CHICKENS IN THE MOULTING STAGE AND OLD WOMEN GENERALLY PERVADING IT
IT IS NOT THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME ONLY THAT IS HORRIBLE
BUT HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF EVER AND ANON IN UNDERTONES AND HIS MUTTERINGS HAD RELATION TO HENRY DUNBAR
IT WAS A BOLD GAME TO HAZARD AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN A FEARFULLY PERILOUS AND DIFFICULT GAME TO PLAY AND THE MAN HAS PLAYED IT WELL TO HAVE ESCAPED SUSPICION SO LONG
IF I COULD ONLY GET AWAY FROM THIS PLACE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
YOU ARE INDEED
WHAT THREAT COULD HE USE TO TERRIFY HER I SHOOK MY HEAD HOPELESSLY
THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION
WE SHALL PICK UP ALL MANNER OF INFORMATION IN A PROMISCUOUS WAY IF WE'RE STAYING IN THE HOUSE
GREAT HEAVENS HE CRIED AT LAST
THE BRIDE THAT THE RAIN RAINS ON XXIV
HOW HE STOPPED HALF ASHAMED OF HIS PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM
THE YOUNG LAWYER TRAVELLED ALONG THE LINE STOPPING AT EVERY STATION
GOOD MORNING HE HURRIED OUT OF THE PARLOUR AND INTO A PASSAGE LEADING TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY MR BALDERBY WHO WONDERED AT HIS SENIOR PARTNER'S EXCITEMENT
HENRY DUNBAR STOOD IN THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT INTO THE STREET BELOW WHILE THE BREAKFAST WAS BEING PLACED UPON THE TABLE
THAT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
I NEVER SEE SUCH A FACE IN MY LIFE AS GHASTLY-LIKE AS IF HE'D SEEN A GHOST
MARGARET SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN,--IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD CALLED HIS MOTHER'S PROTEGEE BY HER CHRISTIAN NAME AND THE GIRL LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A SURPRISED EXPRESSION,--"MARGARET THAT WHICH HAPPENED TO-DAY MAKES ME THINK THAT YOUR CONVICTION IS ONLY THE HORRIBLE TRUTH AND THAT HENRY DUNBAR THE SOLE SURVIVING KINSMAN OF THOSE TWO MEN WHOM I LEARNT TO HONOUR AND REVERE LONG AGO WHEN I WAS A MERE BOY IS INDEED GUILTY OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH
IF JOSEPH WILMOT'S NAME IS EVER MENTIONED PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT HE WENT TO AMERICA
I'VE COME TO MAKE A FEW INQUIRIES ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS MAJOR VERNON THE DETECTIVE SAID
I AM COMPELLED TO ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION MR DUNBAR HE SAID PRESENTLY HESITATING A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE
IF THEY SHOULD BE THERE BEFORE ME
HENRY DUNBAR COULD AFFORD TO BUY ALL THE SECRETS THAT EVER WERE KEPT
THE ROOM WAS NEATLY KEPT BUT POORLY FURNISHED WITH THAT OLD-FASHIONED SPINDLE-LEGGED FURNITURE WHICH SEEMS PECULIAR TO LODGING-HOUSES
SHE WAS HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY OF HER FIRST AND PUREST LOVE
IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO FIND AN ANSWER FOR MR DUNBAR'S SPEECH
YOU NEED'NT TROUBLE YOURSELF
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY TOLERABLY ADVANCED IN HER STUDY OF THE PIANO AND MY SISTER WAS ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD CONTINUE THAT STUDY UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF A DULY-QUALIFIED INSTRUCTRESS WHOSE TERMS SHOULD BE MODERATE
THE GOLD AND SILVER REFINERS THE DIAMOND-MERCHANTS AND WHOLESALE JEWELLERS IN THIS QUIET STREET WERE A VERY SUPERIOR CLASS OF PEOPLE AND YOU MIGHT DISPOSE OF A HANDFUL OF GOLD CHAINS AND BANGLES WITHOUT ANY FEAR THAT ONE OR TWO OF THEM WOULD FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE OPERATOR'S SLEEVE DURING THE PROCESS OF WEIGHING
YOU ARE VERY PUNCTUAL MR DUNBAR HE SAID
AND I MUST ADMIT THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP--SOMETHING HOLIER AND HIGHER IN ITS CHARACTER--THE PURE AND UNSELFISH LOVE OF AN HONOURABLE MAN
JOCELYN'S ROCK WAS TEN MILES FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND ONLY ONE MILE FROM THE TOWN OF SHORNCLIFFE
IF YOU DO THINK SO YOU MUST HAVE A VERY SMALL IDEA OF PARENTAL AFFECTION THEN I'LL REFUSE THE APPOINTMENT FATHER GOD BLESS YOU MY BOY EXCLAIMED THE LAWYER
I WAS A GREAT DEAL AT THE ABBEY IN OLD MR DUNBAR'S TIME AND YOU WILL STILL BE MORE OFTEN THERE IN MY TIME I HOPE HENRY DUNBAR ANSWERED COURTEOUSLY
ARTHUR LOVELL LOOKED INTO THE ROOM AS HE PASSED AND SAW HIS FATHER SITTING BY THE FIRE WITH A NEWSPAPER AT HIS FEET
GOOD GRACIOUS ME YOUNG WOMAN EXCLAIMED THE PORTER DO YOU THINK AS I'M GOIN TO SEND SUCH A RAMPAGIN KIND OF A MESSAGE AS THAT TO MR DUNBAR
MISS WILMOT--MARGARET I SAID
I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER ANNOUNCING YOUR JOURNEY TO LONDON AND YOUR DESIRE FOR A PRIVATE INTERVIEW ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON MR BALDERBY SAID AFTER A PAUSE
AND LAURA TELLS ME THAT SHE INFINITELY PREFERS MAUDESLEY TO LONDON
THE OLD VERGER WAS STILL POTTERING ABOUT THE GREY QUADRANGLE SUNNING HIMSELF IN SUCH GLIMPSES OF THE GLORIOUS LIGHT AS FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THAT SHADOWY PLACE WHEN ONE OF THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HIM RETURNED
COME MARGARET
FOUL RIVER-INSECTS CREPT OUT OF THE WEEDS WHICH WERE SO INTERMINGLED WITH THE TATTERED FABRICS THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH ONE SUBSTANCE FROM THE OTHER
BUT GIVE HIM WHAT HE WOULD MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR COULD NEVER GIVE HIS SON ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM FREE OF GAMBLING DEBTS AND LOSSES ON THE TURF
THE STROKE OF DEATH
PRAY DO NOT LET ME BE DISTURBED ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
OR WAS THIS A STORY GOT UP TO THROW HIM OFF THE SCENT
A MAN IN A DARK BLUE COAT WITH A FUR COLLAR YES
I LAURA LOOKED DESPAIRINGLY AT MR KERSTALL THE YOUNGER
THREE TIMES IN THE COURSE OF MY JOURNEY FROM LONDON TO WINCHESTER I HAVE TAKEN MARGARET'S STRANGE LETTER FROM MY POCKET-BOOK AND HAVE READ THE FAMILIAR LINES WITH THE IDEA OF PUTTING ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN MY COMPANION AND PLACING THE LETTER IN HIS HANDS
MARGARET STARTED UP A LITTLE CONFUSED AT THE ADVENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED VISITOR
HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN WHO FULLY APPRECIATES THE POWER OF WEALTH
I TOLD YOU ON THE CONTRARY THAT I CAME HERE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS ORDERED TO MEET YOU INDEED
AND AT NIGHT I SAW THEM BOTH THE MAN AND CLEMENT
HERE MR CARTER WAS INFORMED THAT THE KEY OF WOODBINE COTTAGE HAD BEEN GIVEN UP ON THE EVENING OF THAT VERY DAY ON WHICH HE HAD SEEN JOSEPH WILMOT SITTING IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR
YOU'RE TIRED
AND I FANCIED POOR GIRL THAT SHE HAD PERHAPS KNOWN VERY LITTLE OTHER HAPPINESS AND HER TERMS MOTHER I SAID
WHAT NEXT I WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE FATHER
TO BE SURE TO BE SURE
C
C
C
MARGARET MY MOTHER LOVES YOU
THERE WAS A TRAIN WOULD CONVEY ME FROM WATERLOO TO KYLMINGTON THAT AFTERNOON--A TRAIN THAT WOULD LEAVE WATERLOO AT HALF-PAST THREE
AND OUT OF MY BELIEF IN THE JUSTICE OF HEAVEN THERE GREW UP IN MY MIND THE FAITH IN A HAPPIER LIFE IN STORE FOR MY NOBLE GIRL
THE WATCH DIDN'T OPEN QUITE IN THE USUAL MANNER AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS RATHER AWKWARD IN OPENING IT MY FRIEND THE VERGER TELLS ME
MY DAY'S WORK WILL BE ALL OVER LONG BEFORE THAT AND I'LL TRY AND GET SOMETHING NICE FOR YOUR SUPPER VERY WELL THEN I'LL BE BACK BY TEN O'CLOCK TO-NIGHT
THE WITNESSES SUMMONED WERE THE TWO IRISHMEN PATRICK HENNESSY AND PHILIP MURTOCK WHO HAD FOUND THE BODY IN THE STREAM NEAR ST CROSS
SOME OF THE LADIES WERE ELDERLY AND STERN
ARTHUR LOVELL WATCHING HIM VERY INTENTLY SAW THIS AND WONDERED AT IT
MY SORROW WAS A PART OF MY LIFE
CLEMENT AUSTIN HAD WATCHED HER FAR TOO CLOSELY NOT TO UNDERSTAND HER BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE
IT WAS A STRANGE DOCUMENT TO LIE AGAINST THAT VIRGINAL BOSOM
YOU MUST DO AS MUCH AS THAT FOR ME
THE MAJOR GAVE A PROFOUND SIGH AS HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
I THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR MARGARET SHE SAID
SHALL I DESCRIBE HER,--THE WOMAN WHOM I HAVE ONLY KNOWN FOUR WEEKS AND WHO SEEMS TO FILL ALL THE UNIVERSE WHEN I THINK OF HER?--AND WHEN DO I NOT THINK OF HER
BUT HE FANCIED THAT MR DAPHNEY WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO CARRYING HIS PATIENT IN TRIUMPH TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE UNPROFESSIONAL PUBLIC AND TO THE AGGRAVATION OF RIVAL MEDICAL MEN
HE HAD NOTICED THE CHANGE IN HER COSTUME WHEN SHE PUT ON SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE MOURNING FOR HER DEAD FATHER
HE SLEPT THAT NIGHT AT THE VILLAGE INN WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE DAY AND THE NEXT MORNING WALKED INTO SOUTHAMPTON
THE RICH MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF THE SUITE OF APARTMENTS THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM AND RARELY LEFT HIS OWN ROOMS
BUT IT WENT ON RAINING NEVERTHELESS
BUT YOU CAN ONLY WALK THAT WAY FOR THERE'S GATES AND STILES AND SUCH LIKE YES I KNOW
VERY FITFULLY AS IF THE OLD CLERK'S WEARY SOUL HAD BEEN MAKING FEEBLE STRUGGLES TO BE RELEASED FROM ITS FRAIL TABERNACLE OF CLAY
SHE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN AND HAD NOT YET COME OUT BUT SHE HAD SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF SOCIETY FOR IT HAD BEEN THE DELIGHT OF HER GRANDFATHER TO HAVE HER PERPETUALLY WITH HIM
BUT IF THEY IDLED A LITTLE JUST NOW IN THIS DELICIOUS HONEYMOON-TIME WHEN IT WAS SO SWEET TO BE TOGETHER ALWAYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT DRIVING IN A SLEIGH WITH JINGLING BELLS UPON THE SNOWY ROADS IN THE BOIS SITTING ON THE BALCONY AT MEURICE'S AT NIGHT LOOKING DOWN INTO THE LONG LAMP-LIT STREET AND THE MISTY GARDENS WHERE THE TREES WERE LEAFLESS AND BLACK AGAINST THE DARK BLUE SKY THEY MEANT TO DO THEIR DUTY AND BE USEFUL TO THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES WHEN THEY WERE SETTLED AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
AND AS THIS ONE FELLOW-PASSENGER SLEPT THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY WITH HIS FACE COVERED BY AN EXPANSIVE SILK HANDKERCHIEF MARGARET WAS LEFT FREE TO THINK HER OWN THOUGHTS
NO INDEED
HE WAS READY NOW FOR THE WORST
A COMMON LABOURER WORKING FOR A DAILY WAGE
MY DEAR WILMOT HE SAID IN NO WISE STARTLED BY THE VEHEMENCE OF HIS COMPANION ALL THAT IS SO MUCH SENTIMENTAL TALK
IF MARGARET WILMOT'S FATHER HAD DONE THIS HATEFUL DEED HE MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME THOUGH THE BROKEN HEART OF HIS INNOCENT DAUGHTER WAS A SACRIFICE TO HIS INIQUITY
YOU WILL INHERIT A VERY GOOD PRACTICE AND A COMFORTABLE FORTUNE
ARTHUR LOVELL AND MR DUNBAR WERE IN THE HALL WITH THE TWO CLERGYMEN
SHE DID NOT LOOK UP UNTIL A MAN'S VOICE SAID IN SUBDUED TONES GOOD EVENING MISS WENTWORTH
EVERY SUNDAY SHE DINED WITH MRS AUSTIN
I BEGAN MY TASK IN THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE WAY BY CONSULTING THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS WHERE I FOUND SO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS EMANATING FROM LADIES WHO DECLARED THEMSELVES PROFICIENTS IN THE ART OF MUSIC THAT I WAS CONFUSED AND EMBARRASSED BY THE WEALTH OF MY RESOURCES
THE MARRIAGE-SERVICE WAS COMMENCED
MY MOTHER SUPPORTED ME IN THIS FAITH
HEAVEN GRANT THIS MAY BE LOVE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
WHAT IF--WHAT IF GOADED BY HER PERSISTENCE MADDENED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN GUILT HE SHOULD ATTEMPT ANY VIOLENCE
THE HORSE WAS SADDLED AND BRIDLED IN FIVE MINUTES AND JOSEPH WILMOT LED HIM OUT OF THE STABLE FOLLOWED BY MARGARET WHO STILL CARRIED THE LAMP
YOU HAVE PLAYED THE MAN OF FASHION AND YOUR ARISTOCRATIC ASSOCIATES HAVE LED YOU TO THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF TO-DAY
WELL I'VE KNOWN THE TIME WHEN----BUT NO MATTER LET WHAT IS BROKEN SO REMAIN AS THE POET OBSERVES
HE HAD BETRAYED FEAR IN HER PRESENCE THAT MORNING
TO THIS LAST LOVE IS FAITH
I'M GOING TO ASK YOUR LADYSHIP A QUESTION SAID MR CARTER PRESENTLY LOOKING GRAVELY AND ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY AT THE BEAUTIFUL FACE BEFORE HIM
I KNOW NOW THAT IT WAS SO
I HAVE NO RIGHT TO KEEP THEM NOW SHE SPOKE VERY MOURNFULLY
WHEN SHE TOLD YOU THAT HENRY DUNBAR WAS INNOCENT OF HER FATHER'S MURDER SHE ONLY TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
HE HAS BEEN VISITING IN WARWICKSHIRE AND HE LUNCHED WITH MY FATHER EN PASSANT
HE RAN TO THE LODGE UPON THE LISFORD ROAD AND ASKED THE WOMAN WHO KEPT IT IF A LADY HAD GONE OUT ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW
NOW WHERE'S MR DUNBAR'S MOTIVE FOR MURDERING THIS MAN WILMOT THE SECRET THAT JOSEPH WILMOT POSSESSED BAH MY DEAR SIR
IT'S PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK AND I'M TIRED TO BE SURE
HE HAD MET HIS OLD MASTER THE MAN WHO HAD SO BITTERLY INJURED HIM
I AM ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED
PACK MY PORTMANTEAU AT ONCE JEFFREYS AND ORDER THE CARRIAGE TO BE READY FOR ME AT A QUARTER TO FOUR
BUT IF SO THE COVERING HAD GROWN SHABBY AGAIN
I CAN'T SIT QUIET THIS AFTERNOON
WHEN DID YOU EVER DO ANYTHING THAT WASN'T WISE AND GOOD HER ONLY SON CLEMENT WAS THE GOD OF THIS SIMPLE WOMAN'S IDOLATRY
HE WENT TO LIVE WITH THE CORNET IN THE JANUARY OF THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FABRICATED BILLS WERE PRESENTED AT OUR COUNTER AND WHEN WERE THE BILLS PRESENTED NOT TILL THE FOLLOWING AUGUST SIR
ONE OF THE MEN OPINED THAT THE MASTER HAD GOT A SWELL COVE ON BOARD TO-DAY INASMUCH AS HE HAD SEEN SUCH A ONE HANGING ABOUT THE QUAY-SIDE TEN MINUTES OR SO BEFORE THE CROW SAILED
THE WEDDING-PARTY PASSED OUT OF THE CHURCH-PORCH
I DO NOT THINK THAT IN ALL HIS LIFE PHILIP JOCELYN HAD EVER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CAUSED A PANG OF PAIN OR SORROW TO ANY HUMAN BEING UNLESS IT WAS INDEED TO A CHURLISH HEIR-AT-LAW WHO MAY HAVE LOOKED WITH A SOMEWHAT EVIL EYE UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S VIGOROUS AND HEALTHFUL ASPECT WHICH GAVE LITTLE HOPE TO HIS POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR
HE HAD GIVEN ALL THE TRUTH ALL THE PASSION OF WHICH HIS NATURE WAS CAPABLE TO THE ONE WOMAN WHO HAD POSSESSED THE POWER TO CHARM HIM
HE KNOCKED SOFTLY BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER
WELL MADGE HE ADDED IN A MORE SERIOUS TONE YOU'RE A GENEROUS-MINDED NOBLE-SPIRITED GIRL AND I BELIEVE YOU DO LOVE ME
HEAVEN LEAD ME RIGHT
MY LETTER WOULD HAVE ONLY TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
THAT BRIGHT SUNNY AUGUST MORNING ON WHICH THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN LAY IN THE DARKENED CHAMBER AT WINCHESTER
IT WAS ONLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT THE MEMORY OF THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY RETURNED TO HIM
BUT I WILL NEVER LEAVE MY WEALTH TO A DISHONEST OR DISHONOURABLE MAN AND IT REMAINS FOR YOU TO PROVE WHETHER YOU ARE WORTHY TO INHERIT IT
HE WAS FEEBLE AND HIS HANDS WERE TREMULOUS WITH A PERPETUAL NERVOUS MOTION
I NEVER SAW YOU SO SERIOUS BEFORE EXCEPT AFTER YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH I AM THINKING OF MY FATHER SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE THAT WAS BROKEN BY HER TEARS
COULD SHE EVER AGAIN LOVE ME WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE IN HER MIND
MARGARET SAID MR AUSTIN TRYING TO TAKE HER HAND
THE OTHER WAS MISS WILSON WHOSE TERMS WERE LOWER THAN MADAME CARINDA'S--THOUGH MADAME WASN'T A BIT A FOREIGNER EXCEPT BY NAME--AND WHO WAS MUCH RESPECTED IN THE TOWN
THE LOVELIEST SPOTS ON EARTH ARE THOSE WHERE MAN SELDOM COMES
BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE JUNIOR PARTNER MURMURED HIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HENRY DUNBAR'S POLITENESS
EXCEPT TO WANDER ALONE AMONGST THE SHADY AVENUES OF THE PARK
I MUST FIND HIM AT ANY COST
I WAS IN A VERY IDLE FRAME OF MIND READY TO BE DRIVEN BY ANY CHANCE WIND
YOU GAVE ME THESE WHEN I WAS YOUR BETROTHED WIFE MR AUSTIN
YOU MUSTN'T EXPECT TO FIND MR DUNBAR LIKE YOUR GRAN'PA A SUDDEN CLOUD FELL UPON THE GIRL'S LOVELY FACE
THE RAIN WAS STILL FALLING AS THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE CHURCHYARD
PERHAPS HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT THE WORLD CALLS A GOOD FATHER
HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT CHARM HE FOUND IN THE SHADY SLUMBEROUS OLD STREET THE LOW STONE MARKET-PLACE WITH RUSTY IRON GATES SURMOUNTED BY THE JOCELYN ESCUTCHEON
HE WILL SURELY NEVER BE SO UNWISE AS TO BETRAY HIS TERROR OF ME AND IF HE DOES REFUSE IF HE DOES I'LL INVENT SOME STRATAGEM BY WHICH I MAY SEE HIM
HE WENT AND I FINISHED MY LETTER TO MY MOTHER
BUT HALF OF THE TIME IS GONE AND I'VE HAD A LETTER FROM LORD HERRISTON BY THIS AFTERNOON'S POST
IN THIS AT LEAST HE SHOWED HIMSELF A CONSIDERATE FATHER
WE SHAN'T KNOW THE RESULT OF IT TILL TO-MORROW MARGARET SAT LISTENING TO THESE WORDS WITH A FACE THAT WAS AS WHITE AS THE FACE OF THE DEAD
BUT THEN IT HAPPENED UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE FAITHFUL ELIZABETH WAS VERY STOUT AND RATHER ASTHMATIC
THEY WERE EVEN DISAGREEABLE TO HER FATHER
LET THIS KNOWLEDGE CONTENT YOU AND ALLOW THE SECRET OF THE MURDER TO REMAIN FOR EVER A MYSTERY UPON EARTH GOD KNOWS THE TRUTH AND HAS DOUBTLESS PUNISHED THE WRETCHED SINNER WHO WAS GUILTY OF THAT CRIME AS HE PUNISHES EVERY OTHER SINNER SOONER OR LATER IN THE COURSE OF HIS INEFFABLE WISDOM
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO NOTHING SIR UNTIL TO-MORROW
HENRY DUNBAR ARRIVED IN LONDON A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER MR VERNON LEFT THE ABBEY
IF YOU WISH TO MAKE ANY INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSE I MR DUNBAR WAVED HIS HAND WITH A DEPRECATORY AIR
I DON'T KNOW THE GOSPEL BUT I DO KNOW THE WORLD
THE HORSE PLUNGED HIS HEAD ABOUT HIS MASTER'S SHOULDERS AND SHOOK HIS MANE AND REARED AND DISPORTED HIMSELF IN HIS DELIGHT AT SEEING HIS OLD FRIEND ONCE MORE AND IT WAS ONLY JOSEPH WILMOT'S SOOTHING HAND AND VOICE THAT SUBDUED THE ANIMAL'S EXUBERANT SPIRITS
HE WOULD DIVIDE A CASE OF CHOICE MANILLAS WITH A BEDRIDDEN PENSIONER IN THE UNION OR CARRY A BOTTLE OF THE JOCELYN MADEIRA--THE CELEBRATED MADEIRA WITH THE BROWN SEAL--IN THE POCKET OF HIS SHOOTING-COAT TO DELIVER IT INTO THE HORNY HANDS OF SOME HARD-WORKING MOTHER WHO WAS BURDENED WITH A SICK CHILD
AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING FEVERISH AND UNNATURAL IN THE BANKER'S GAIETY
HENRY DUNBAR WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS OLD VALET
I'LL WORK IT OUT QUIETLY
I TOLD THE DETECTIVE THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN THE MURDERED MAN IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE AND HAD NEVER HEARD HIS NAME UNTIL AFTER THE MURDER
HE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD MARRY AS THE REST OF THE JOCELYNS HAD MARRIED
THESE HAD BEEN USED TO SINK THE BUNDLE BUT WERE NOT SO HEAVY AS TO PREVENT ITS DRIFTING INTO THE HOLE WHERE IT HAD BEEN FOUND
REMEMBER MY BELOVED ONE THIS WEALTH THAT NOW STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND ME MAY NOT ALWAYS BE YOURS
THE BUSINESS HAD GONE ON WITHOUT HIM VERY WELL DURING HIS ABSENCE AND IT WENT ON WITHOUT HIM NOW FOR HIS PLACE IN INDIA HAD BEEN ASSUMED BY A VERY CLEVER MAN WHO FOR TWENTY YEARS HAD ACTED AS CASHIER IN THE CALCUTTA HOUSE
YOU DON'T MIND TRAVELLING BY THE MAIL-TRAIN DO YOU MR AUSTIN THE DETECTIVE SAID PRESENTLY
IT'S A SMALL MATTER AND I'VE MENTIONED IT MANY A TIME BOTH TO WILLIAM BRIGMAWL AND TO OTHERS
CLEMENT COULD NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE IN THE BASENESS OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TRUSTED
NO HE SAID WITH DETERMINATION
HE HAS NEVER SUFFERED FOR THAT ONE FALSE STEP IN LIFE WHICH BROUGHT SUCH RUIN UPON ME
THEN HE WENT BACK TO THEM AND WATCHED MARGARET'S FIGURE GROWING DIM AND DISTANT IN THE GATHERING DUSK AS SHE APPROACHED THE ABBEY
ALL MY FUTURE LIFE SEEMED SPREAD BEFORE ME LIKE AN ENDLESS SERIES OF BEAUTIFUL PICTURES--PICTURES IN WHICH I COULD SEE PHILIP AND MYSELF ALWAYS TOGETHER ALWAYS HAPPY
AND IF HE HAD WANTED TO DIG UP THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CATHEDRAL THEY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE VENTURED TO INTERFERE WITH HIS DESIGN
HE GAVE A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF AS HE THREW THE WASTE SCRAPS OF LEATHER UPON THE TOP OF THE LOW FIRE AND WATCHED THEM SLOWLY SMOULDER AWAY INTO BLACK ASHES
AS IF THE FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS HAD NEVER BEEN
FIRST CAME ON MISS LAURA'S WEDDING-DAY
DO YOU WISH TO SEE MR BALDERBY SIR HE ASKED
SO IN THIS DILEMMA I HAD RECOURSE TO A PIECE OF JESUITRY OF WHICH I WAS NOT A LITTLE PROUD
BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS NOT LISTENING ONLY
I AM READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY WISH TO ASK MR DUNBAR REPLIED VERY QUIETLY
IT HAPPENED THUS THAT THE VERY FIRST WORDS HENRY DUNBAR SAID TO HIS DAUGHTER WERE UTTERED IN A TONE OF ANGER
THE SCARLET LEADS THIS TIME
WE MUST WAIT--WE MUST WAIT
BUT LOW AND STRAGGLING
PEDESTRIANS WHO CHOSE THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN LISFORD AND SHORNCLIFFE WENT IN AT ONE GATE AND OUT AT ANOTHER WHICH OPENED ON TO THE HIGH-ROAD
AND YET PHILIP JOCELYN WENT THERE THREE TIMES A WEEK UPON AN AVERAGE DURING THE PERIOD THAT SUCCEEDED THE BALL AND MORNING CONCERT AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
HE WORKED HIS WAY UP AS YOU KNOW SIR IN THE CALCUTTA COUNTING-HOUSE AND BY SLOW DEGREES ROSE TO BE MANAGER OF THE INDIAN BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST HIM--THE BUNDLE OF CLOTHES THE MARKED GARMENTS OF THE MURDERED MAN--THOSE FATAL GARMENTS WHICH HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DESTROY WHICH HE HAD ONLY BEEN ABLE TO HIDE
IF HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT OLD STORY AT ALL IT WAS ONLY TO REMEMBER THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY BADLY USED BY HIS FATHER AND HIS UNCLE HUGH
THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS HAPPENED TO BE RATHER DULL JUST NOW
I'M GOING UP TO LONDON
THAT MEMORY CANNOT BE SO MUCH WORSE THAN THE REST THAT IT SHOULD BE INEFFACEABLE WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN EFFACED
IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING AND EVEN LONDON LOOKED PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE
HENRY DUNBAR AND ARTHUR LOVELL WALKED ARM-IN-ARM UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
IT WAS A COMMON ROPE RATHER SLENDER AND ABOUT A YARD AND A HALF IN LENGTH
A HANSOM CAB RATTLED ME OFF TO THE STATION
I THEN RETURNED TO THE CATHEDRAL AND YOU WAITED THERE FOR THE DECEASED I DID
HE COULD ONLY THINK OF THIS STRANGE CHANCE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM AFTER FIVE-AND-THIRTY WEARY YEARS
PHILIP JOCELYN CAME OUT OF THE PORCH AND DOWN THE NARROW PATHWAY LEADING TO THE GATE
GOING OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN AT THE DOOR OF HIS MOTHER'S CHAMBER
IF I HAD BEEN A HAPPY MAN WITH NO GREAT TROUBLE WEIGHING UPON MY MIND AND GIVING ITS OWN DULL COLOUR TO EVERY EVENT OF MY LIFE I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY ENTERTAINED BY THE SOCIETY OF MR CARTER THE DETECTIVE
THE SOUTHERN WING OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY OWED ITS ORIGIN TO A MUCH LATER PERIOD
BUT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FOR HER TO DO
THE DETECTIVE'S NAME WAS GIVEN AS HENRY CARTER
I WANT TO GET BACK TO MAUDESLEY HE SAID
HE WAS A MAN WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN THE ASPECT OF A SHABBY-GENTEEL HALF-PAY CAPTAIN AND AN UNLUCKY STOCKBROKER
THE JUNIOR PARTNER WAS SITTING AT AN OFFICE TABLE NEAR THE FIRE WRITING BUT HE ROSE AS THE BANKER ENTERED THE ROOM AND WENT FORWARD TO MEET HIM
AND THE MAN RETURNED TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING RECEIVED AN ORDER AND WITHOUT HAVING EVEN SEEN THE BRILLIANTS WHICH THE BANKER HAD BOUGHT
SO BEAUTIFUL THAT HER PRESENCE WAS LIKE THE SUNLIGHT AND MADE THE MEANEST PLACE SPLENDID
BUT HE SAID NOTHING TO THE WAITER WHO BROUGHT HIM THAT POPULAR BEVERAGE
BUT BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE MAN TO WHOM SUSPICION POINTED HAD THE SUPREME VIRTUES COMPRISED IN A MILLION OF MONEY JUSTICE WORE HER THICKEST BANDAGE AND THE OFFICIALS WHO ARE SO CLEVER IN TRACKING A LOW-BORN WRETCH TO THE GALLOWS HELD ALOOF AND SAID RESPECTFULLY HENRY DUNBAR IS TOO GREAT A MAN TO BE GUILTY OF A DIABOLICAL CRIME THESE THOUGHTS FILLED MY MIND AS I WALKED BACK TO THE GEORGE HOTEL WITH MR CARTER
HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AT THE WAITER WHO WAS STILL HOVERING ABOUT ANXIOUS TO BE USEFUL
BUT HE DID ALL HE COULD TO SAVE THE GIRL FROM THE FATIGUE SHE WAS LIKELY TO ENTAIL UPON HERSELF THROUGH HER OWN FOLLY
BUT THOUGH THE FRESH AIR MADE HIM FEEL FAINT AND DIZZY HE FELT HIMSELF A NEW MAN NOW THAT THE HORSE WAS UNDER HIM--THE BRAVE HORSE THE CREATURE THAT LOVED HIM WHOSE POWERFUL STRIDE COULD CARRY HIM ALMOST TO THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD
DRESDEN-CHINA SHEPHERDESSES IN THE CENTRE OF THE OVAL TABLE HELD UP THEIR CHINTZ-PATTERNED APRONS FILLED WITH SOME FORCED STRAWBERRIES THAT HAD COST ABOUT HALF-A-CROWN APIECE
BUT ALTHOUGH MOSELLE AT HALF-A-GUINEA A BOTTLE COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN A VERY COMMON BEVERAGE TO THE EX-CONVICT HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO APPRECIATION OF THE VINTAGE
I CAN GET YOU PLENTY OF PUPILS MY DEAR MRS AUSTIN SAID
BUT HIS BREATH CAME QUICKER AND HIS FACE GREW VERY PALE
AND LITTLE BY LITTLE WE GREW TO SHUN EACH OTHER TILL AT LAST WE MET LIKE STRANGERS OR SOMETHING WORSE THAN STRANGERS
NOW POINT NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER OF THE MAN THAT WAS MURDERED
THE GIRL CALLED BETSY USHERED THE DETECTIVE INTO A BEDROOM WHICH SHE SAID WAS HER MASTER'S AND WHERE THE OCCUPATION OF THE MAJOR WAS MADE MANIFEST BY DIVERS ARTICLES OF APPAREL LYING ON THE CHAIRS AND HANGING ON THE PEGS AND FURTHERMORE BY A POWERFUL EFFLUVIUM OF STALE TOBACCO AND A COLLECTION OF PIPES AND CIGAR-BOXES ON THE CHIMNEY-PIECE
AND STILL BROODED OVER HIS OWN BLACK THOUGHTS
AS IF JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NEVER BEEN WRONGED BY HIM
I SHOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN SITTING QUIETLY IN A PRIVATE BOX WITH MY RAPID PRECIOUS AGGRAVATING DARLING OLD NURSE TO KEEP WATCH AND WARD OVER ME
I AM UNFIT TO BE THE ASSOCIATE OF AN HONEST MAN MISS WILMOT SAYS TO YOU
ARTHUR LOVELL BREATHED MORE FREELY
MARGARET WAS STANDING WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT SHE HAD PUT ON HER BONNET AND GLOVES AND WAS QUITE READY TO LEAVE THE HOUSE
BUT I TOLD HIM THE NOTION WASN'T PRACTICABLE SIR
WELL THE MAN WAS DEAD SIR
BUT I'VE HAD THE DEVIL'S OWN LUCK ALL THIS YEAR
I THOUGHT IT HAD A PITIFUL LOOK SOMEHOW THAT UNDERSCORING OF THE ADVERB AND SEEMED ALMOST AN APPEAL FOR EMPLOYMENT
WHY DID YOU DO THIS THE YOUNG MAN STAMMERED OUT SOME RAMBLING EXCUSE ABOUT HIS TURF LOSSES DEBTS OF HONOUR WHICH HE WAS COMPELLED TO PAY
THAT LAST SENTENCE RAN THUS
HEREWITH MR DUNBAR FORWARDS THE YOUNG PERSON A SUM OF MONEY WHICH WILL ENABLE HER TO LIVE FOR SOME TIME WITH EASE AND INDEPENDENCE
SHE WANTED HIM TO BE NEAR HER
HA WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO MOST CONFIDENTLY BELIEVE IN THEIR OWN MERITS
MEANWHILE THE FORESTERS ARMS DID MORE BUSINESS THAN HAD BEEN DONE THERE IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN
BY THIS MEANS HE CONTRIVED TO KEEP THE LISFORDIANS CONSTANT TO ONE TOPIC ALL THE EVENING AND THAT TOPIC WAS THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF HENRY DUNBAR
I THOUGHT I BROUGHT A CANE HE SAID
AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT CALL ME WHEN THE SOUP IS COLD
SHE WANTED TO SEE YOU SHE SAID
TO GO HITHER AND THITHER FREE AS THE BUTTERFLIES IN HER CAREFULLY TENDED GARDEN
I THINK MISS DUNBAR LOOKED LOVELIER IN THIS DESHABILLE THAN MANY A BRIDE IN HER LACE AND ORANGE-BLOSSOMS
YOU MUST ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE SORT OF THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
THEY MAY MAKE A CABAL AGAINST ME IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE AND DECLINE TO HANG EM
I SAW NOW THAT THIS STONY GLARE WAS ONLY THE FIXED EXPRESSION OF MR CARTER'S FACE WHEN HE WAS THINKING PROFOUNDLY AND THAT THE RELENTLESSNESS OF HIS GAZE HAD VERY LITTLE RELATION TO THE OBJECT AT WHICH HE GAZED
I LOOKED AT ALL THE NEWEST STONES TILL I CAME AT LAST TO ONE STANDING IN THE OBSCUREST CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE LOW WALL
HENRY DUNBAR WAS A GOOD DEAL THE WORSE FOR THE CLOSE CONFINEMENT WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN THE CATHEDRAL CITY
A GREAT MANY OF THE LISFORDIANS HAD SEEN THE SHABBY STRANGER TAKE HIS SEAT IN HENRY DUNBAR'S CARRIAGE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE GREAT BANKER
SHE TRAVELLED FROM MAUDESLEY ABBEY TO PORTLAND PLACE IN THE COMPANY OF HER NURSE,--A CERTAIN ELIZABETH MADDEN WHO HAD BEEN LADY LOUISA'S OWN MAID BEFORE HER MARRIAGE WITH CAPTAIN MACMAHON AND WHO WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO THE MOTHERLESS GIRL
HE HAD NOT LOOKED AT THE ANGLO-INDIAN
NO ONE NEED SIT UP FOR ME
HE STOOD FACING THE SUNLIGHT
YOU WILL TELL HIM THAT ALL WILL BE READY FOR HIS RECEPTION HERE
MARGARET SPOKE PRESENTLY IN A CLEAR RINGING VOICE THAT VIBRATED THROUGH THE HALL
HE HAD SEEN HIS SENTENCE IN HER INNOCENT FACE
NEW-LAID EGGS IS GOOD FOR THE SPIRITS MY POPPET LAURA DUNBAR SEATED HERSELF IN THE COMFORTABLE ARM-CHAIR BETWEEN THE FIREPLACE AND THE LITTLE BREAKFAST-TABLE
HOW WILL YOU ANSWER PEOPLE WHEN THEY ASK YOU THE NAME OF YOUR WIFE I WILL TELL THEM THAT SHE HAS NO NAME BUT THAT WHICH SHE HAS HONOURED BY ACCEPTING FROM ME
I THOUGHT THAT PAPA MIGHT FALL ILL ON THE VOYAGE HOME AND DIE AND THAT THE SHIP FOR WHOSE SAFE COURSE I PRAYED NIGHT AND DAY MIGHT BRING ME NOTHING BUT THE SACRED REMAINS OF THE DEAD
AT MY MOTHER'S DEATH CAPTAIN TALBOT'S HEART WAS TOUCHED
SHE HAS RETURNED THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
THIS WORK TOOK HIM SO LONG THAT IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN HE HAD QUILTED THE LAST DIAMOND INTO THE BELT
SOMETIMES HE WAS AT HOME FOR WEEKS TOGETHER A PREY TO A FIT OF MELANCHOLY
AND THAT THE LOSS HAD BEEN UNEXPECTED AND WAS VERY BITTER TO BEAR
BESIDES HOW CAN I TELL IN WHAT MANNER THIS LETTER MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
THIS BUSINESS OCCUPIED A VERY LONG TIME AND THE HANDS OF AN ANTIQUE CLOCK UPON A BRACKET IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM POINTED TO MIDNIGHT WHEN THE BANKER SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE AND BEGAN TO ARRANGE AND SORT HIS PAPERS
SHE STILL BELIEVED THAT HE WAS THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER
JOSEPH WILMOT FOLLOWED HER TO THE DOOR AND TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK
IS IT YOU
AND THAT TO SERVE HENRY DUNBAR WAS IN SOME MANNER TO SERVE THE WOMAN HE LOVED
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING FROM THE TREES AND DRIFTING WITH A RUSTLING SOUND ALONG THE DUSTY ROADWAY
THEY WERE ALL THE MORE PLEASANT PERHAPS
I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I NEVER QUARRELLED WITH HIM PERHAPS NOT
I AM AFRAID I STARTLED YOU MISS WILMOT HE SAID
HE FOUND THE WORKS OF THE LATE MR APPERLY MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE LAST NEW IDYL FROM THE PEN OF THE LAUREATE
OH BY THE BYE EXCLAIMED THE DETECTIVE THERE WAS A LETTER WASN'T THERE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND AS I SEARCHED FOR THE LETTER IN MY POCKET-BOOK
IT'S SOMETHING OF A HEART-SHAPED STONE YOU SEE
THE FIRST STAGE ON THE JOURNEY HOME
IT IS TAKEN AS A STRONG PROOF OF A MAN'S INNOCENCE THAT HE SHOULD LOOK YOU FULL IN THE FACE WITH A STEADFAST GAZE WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM WITH SUSPICION PLAINLY VISIBLE IN YOUR EYES
I WANT ANOTHER TWO THOU FRIEND OF MY YOUTH AND PATRON OF MY LATER YEARS
EVEN BEYOND THIS IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT IF YOU KNEW THIS JOSEPH WILMOT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON HIS ANTECEDENTS AND THUS GIVE A CLUE TO THE ASSASSIN
BUT NOT TO-DAY
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM A LITTLE ABSENTLY AS HE RE-ENTERED THE ROOM
HE WAS TALL HIMSELF AND THE HAT MADE HIM SEEM TALLER
I TELL YOU AGAIN I'M A COMMERCIAL MAN AND WHAT I WANT IS GOOD VALUE FOR MY MONEY AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT SIR ANSWERED THE DIAMOND-MERCHANT BRISKLY
AND THE VEHICLE DROVE RAPIDLY AWAY LEAVING THE SPECTATORS IN A RAPTURE OF ADMIRATION AT HENRY DUNBAR'S CONDESCENSION TO HIS SHABBY INDIAN ACQUAINTANCE
BUT HAD THE VILLAIN EVER KNOWN ONE MOMENT'S HAPPINESS SINCE THE COMMISSION OF THAT DEED--ONE MOMENT'S PEACE--ONE MOMENT'S FREEDOM FROM A SLOW TORTURING ANGUISH THAT WAS LIKE THE GNAWING OF A RAVENOUS BEAST FOR EVER PREYING ON HIS ENTRAILS
SO SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE BUSINESS LANGUISHED AND AFTER THE RESEARCHES OF A WEEK WE FOUND OURSELVES NO NEARER A DECISION THAN WHEN FIRST I LOOKED AT THE ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE TIMES SUPPLEMENT
I THINK THAT I KNOW WHY THE MURDERED MAN'S COAT WAISTCOAT AND SHIRT WERE STRIPPED OFF HIM I BEGGED THE DETECTIVE TO TELL ME WHAT HE THOUGHT UPON THIS SUBJECT
MR HENRY DUNBAR WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN IN THOSE DAYS--VERY HANDSOME VERY ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING RATHER HAUGHTY IN HIS MANNERS TO STRANGERS BUT AFFABLE AND FREE-SPOKEN TO THOSE WHO HAPPENED TO TAKE HIS FANCY
I SHOULD ORDER IT OF GARRARD OR EMANUEL
SHE IS ASLEEP POOR SOUL HE THOUGHT
CAN YOU GIVE ME BACK THE FIVE-AND-THIRTY BLIGHTED YEARS OF MY LIFE AND TAKE THE BLIGHT FROM THEM
THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH PARDON ME MR DUNBAR IT IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH
AND THAT HE WILL HAVE PITY UPON YOUR ENEMIES THIS LAST WISH WAS MORE CHRISTIANLIKE THAN NATURAL
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY IN HER FITTING PLACE BENEATH THE SHADOW OF A REGAL CANOPY
IN THE MEANTIME IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRANSACTION IS A BONA FIDE ONE I'LL WRITE A CHEQUE FOR TEN THOUSAND PAYABLE TO YOUR ORDER ON ACCOUNT OF DIAMONDS TO BE PURCHASED BY ME
FOR TEN YEARS PRIOR TO MY FATHER'S DEATH HE TOOK NO ACTIVE PART IN THE BUSINESS
IT IS INDEED SIR
THE TIME HUNG VERY HEAVILY ON MY HANDS BETWEEN THAT TIME AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK
OH MY DEAR IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT MISERY YOUR CONDUCT HAS CAUSED ME HE HELD OUT HIS ARMS BUT TO HIS UNUTTERABLE SURPRISE THE GIRL RECOILED FROM HIM
LAURA HAD BEEN OVER ALL THE GROUND WITH HER LOVER ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND HAD LOOKED FEARFULLY AT THE HIGH RAGGED HEDGES AND THE BROAD DITCHES OF MUDDY WATER
OR HE WAS A MISER PERHAPS--AN ECCENTRIC INDIVIDUAL WHO WORE SHABBY BOOTS AND SHINY HATS FOR HIS OWN LOVE AND PLEASURE
HE SAT BY THE LOW FIRE FOR A LITTLE TIME THINKING WITH A SETTLED GLOOM UPON HIS FACE AND DRINKING BURGUNDY OUT OF A TUMBLER
IT HAPPENED THAT THE 6TH OF NOVEMBER WAS A DAY WHICH SOME TIME SINCE PHILIP JOCELYN WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT IF NOT THE HAPPIEST DAY OF THE YEAR
HE LOVED HER TRULY AND DEVOTEDLY AFTER HIS OWN MAD-HEADED FASHION
I THINK MY FRIEND IS SAFE--I DON'T THINK HE'LL RUN AWAY
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN--AN AMIABLE WOMAN
SELL YOUR COMMISSION GO TO INDIA AND ENTER THE COUNTING-HOUSE OF OUR ESTABLISHMENT IN CALCUTTA AS A JUNIOR CLERK
I THANK YOU HEARTILY FOR HAVING BEEN SO CANDID WITH ME LADY JOCELYN HE SAID
BUT STILL JOSEPH WAS SILENT
FROM WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT HE HAD NO MONEY WITH HIM AND IN THAT CASE HE'LL BE TRYING TO TURN SOME OF THOSE DIAMONDS INTO CASH THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT APPEARED IN THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE TIMES FOR THE NEXT DAY
HE SPOKE OF THE SUDDEN FAINTNESS WHICH HAD COME OVER MR DUNBAR
AMONGST THE PAPERS WHICH HE HAD ARRANGED UPON THE WRITING-TABLE THERE WAS A SMALL SQUARE MOROCCO CASE CONTAINING A PHOTOGRAPH DONE UPON GLASS
I WANT TO LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE FACE OF THE MAN WHOM I BELIEVE TO BE MY FATHER'S MURDERER
HE WILL BE TRACED BY THOSE CLOTHES
YOU HAVE GOT SOME CLUE I SAID
AND I DREADED THIS INTERVIEW ON THAT ACCOUNT
CHAPTER XXXV
SAMPSON WILMOT PASSENGER TO SOUTHAMPTON JAMES WENTWORTH GAVE A LONG WHISTLE
WHEN HE DIED HE HOPED TO BE BURIED BENEATH THE FLAGSTONES OF THAT CITY CHURCH AND TO LIE CHEEK BY JOWL WITH THE GOLD IN THE CELLARS OF THE BANK
THE BELT'S BROKE AND HE'S SUNK HE SHOUTED
IS SHE STILL THE SAME MOTHER HE ASKED
I HAD TAKEN SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT--TO THIS HOUR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I ATE UPON THAT BALMY SUMMER EVENING SO ENTIRELY WAS MY MIND ABSORBED BY THAT BRIGHT HOPE WHICH WAS GROWING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER EVERY MOMENT
TELL MR DUNBAR THAT I SHALL BE GLAD TO SPEAK TO HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES THE MAJOR SAID MAKING AS IF HE WOULD HAVE PASSED INTO THE HALL
I'LL WAGER HE'S LIVING AS QUIET AND RESPECTABLE AS ANY GENTLEMAN EVER LIVED YET MR CARTER WENT ON TO TELL ME THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS AND MORTIFICATIONS
I AM REALLY GETTING ALARMED ABOUT HIM MR DUNBAR WENT ON TO SAY HOW HE HAD PARTED WITH THE MISSING MAN IN THE GROVE ON THE WAY TO ST CROSS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WILMOT WAS TO GO ON TO THE FERNS AND REJOIN HIS OLD MASTER IN THE CATHEDRAL
LOOK HERE NOW THIS GENTLEMAN WANTS TO SEE THE HOUSE AND YOU'RE TO SHOW HIM OVER IT AND OVER THE GARDEN TOO IF HE LIKES--AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT FOR I WANT MY DINNER THE GIRL CURTSEYED IN AN AWKWARD COUNTRIFIED MANNER AND USHERED MR CARTER INTO THE HALL
AND STRANGE TO SAY I FORGOT TO ASK HIM THE QUESTION
BUT I HOPE SHE MAY BE GLAD OF MY COMING BACK--I HOPE SHE MAY BE GLAD HE PUT THE LOCKET AGAIN IN ITS PLACE AND TOOK A LETTER FROM HIS BREAST-POCKET
THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO SYMPATHIZED WITH HER WITH AN EARNEST AND PURE DESIRE TO HELP HER IN HER SORROW
THE GIRL DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM HIM AND LOOKED UP ALMOST PITEOUSLY IN HER FATHER'S FACE
SUPPOSE LAURA DOESN'T LOVE ME AFTER ALL
IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO TAKE ME THERE MR DAPHNEY AND LOOK AFTER ME UNTIL I'VE GOT OVER THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACCIDENT I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO MAKE YOU ANY COMPENSATION YOU PLEASE FOR WHATEVER LOSS YOUR ABSENCE FROM RUGBY MIGHT ENTAIL UPON YOU THIS WAS A VERY DIPLOMATIC SPEECH
THE BILL-BROKERS KNEW THAT HIS ACCEPTANCE WAS A FORGERY
I SEIZED UPON THE ONE CHANCE OF MY MISERABLE LIFE
BUT IF SO HE MUST HAVE FAILED FOR HE WAS SILENT FOR THE REST OF THE DRIVE
HILLOA
AND YET LOOKING BACK NOW I WONDER WHAT I THOUGHT OF AND WHAT IMAGE THERE WAS IN MY MIND THAT COULD MAKE MY FANCIES PLEASANT TO ME
HE OVERCAME IT
TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE DEAR BOY THE DEAR BOY DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY PLEASED AS HE LIFTED HIS EYES TO HIS VISITOR'S FACE
WE WILL TELL MY MOTHER NOTHING OF THE PAST MISS WILMOT CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID EXCEPT THAT WHICH CONCERNS YOURSELF ALONE
EAT A BIT OF PERRIGORGE PIE OR A THIN WAFER OF A SLICE OFF THAT STRASBOG AM MISS LAURA DO NOW
WILL YOU DIRECT ME TO THE HERMITAGE
GENTLEMEN--GENTLEMEN I CRIED HAVE PITY UPON HIM
SHE WAS HEART-BROKEN BY THE LOSS OF THE HANDSOME YOUNG IRISHMAN WHOM SHE HAD FONDLY LOVED
HE LOVED DESDEMONA BECAUSE SHE WAS PRETTY AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH SWEET MAIDENLY GLANCES OF PITY WHEN HE TOLD THOSE PROSY STORIES OF HIS--WITH FULL TRAVELLER'S LICENSE NO DOUBT--OVER BRABANTIO'S MAHOGANY
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT ELIZABETH MADDEN FELT SOME SLIGHT PANGS OF CONSCIENCE WITH REGARD TO HER OWN PART IN THIS SUDDEN FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAD ARISEN BETWEEN LAURA DUNBAR AND PHILIP JOCELYN
BUT WHAT OF THAT UNDYING SERPENT CALLED REMORSE WHICH COILS ITSELF ABOUT THE HEART OF THE MURDERER AND HOLDS IT FOR EVER IN A DEADLY GRIP--NEVER TO BEAT FREELY AGAIN NEVER TO KNOW A PAINLESS THROB OR FEEL A SWEET EMOTION
AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS FINISHED AND HE HAD BOWED FOR THE LAST TIME IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THOSE FRIENDLY BECKS AND WREATHED SMILES WHICH GREETED HIM FROM THE CARRIAGE-WINDOW TILL IT DISAPPEARED IN THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE ARTHUR LOVELL WALKED SLOWLY HOME THINKING OF THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY
MRS AUSTIN LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE AS HER SON RE-ENTERED THE ROOM
SO MUCH FOR JAMES WENTWORTH AND THE CLOTHES HE WORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED AWAY
WHAT'S THE ROW THERE HE DEMANDED FIERCELY
THE REVELATION OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S GUILT LEFT ME FREE TO RETURN TO MY OLD POSITION IN THE HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
YOU'LL HAVE LETTERS TO WRITE YOU WILL
USED TO COME AT ALL HOURS TO SEE YOUR MASTER
WHEN THE MAN WAS GONE HE CAME AND PLANTED HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO ME UPON THE HEARTH-RUG
BUT ME AND ELIZA JANE THE UNDER-CHAMBERMAID WAS IN THE HALL AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN CAME IN YOU SAW THEM BOTH THEN YES SIR AS PLAIN AS I NOW SEE YOU
HE WAS RIGHT IN THE MAIN NO DOUBT
WHAT WAS HE THAT I SHOULD BE SORRY FOR HIM
AS I FOLDED THE PAPER I LOOKED HALF IN ABSENCE OF MIND AT THE STAMP IN THE CORNER
SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL TOO ENTHUSIASTIC AND WERE PREPARED TO ADORE MY LITTLE NIECE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
I AM A STRANGER IN ENGLAND
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE PRIM LITTLE HALL WAS AJAR
THERE WAS LITTLE HOPE THAT THE MYSTERY OF HIS FATE WOULD EVER BE FATHOMED BY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
YOU WILL TRUST HER WILL YOU NOT WILLINGLY WITH MY WHOLE HEART YOU WILL FIND HER A TRUE FRIEND THEY HAD RETURNED TO THE LITTLE GARDEN-GATE BY THIS TIME
LAURA DEAR LAURA HE SAID THIS IS FOOLISH BELIEVE ME
FIND YOUR WAY THERE--I'M GOING THERE NOW AND SHALL BE THERE LONG BEFORE YOU--YOU UNDERSTAND YES
THIS HENRY DUNBAR HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM ENGLAND FOR FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AND NO LIVING CREATURE NOW EMPLOYED IN THE BANK EXCEPT SAMPSON WILMOT HAD EVER SET EYES UPON HIM
THE VERGER WAITED UPON HIS PATRON'S PLEASURE AND LINGERED IN ATTENDANCE UPON HIM THOUGH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE GONE HOME TO HIS TEA WHICH IN THE COMMON COURSE HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN AT FIVE O'CLOCK
AT ANOTHER SHOP HE BOUGHT SOME LARGE NEEDLES HALF-A-DOZEN SKEINS OF STOUT WAXED THREAD A PAIR OF LARGE SCISSORS A COUPLE OF STRONG STEEL BUCKLES AND A TAILOR'S THIMBLE
TO M SO LIKE OTHER APPEALS MADE THROUGH THE SAME MEDIUM
BY-AND-BY HE UNFASTENED THE LOCKET FROM THE CHAIN AND HANDED IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO ARTHUR LOVELL
SHE WAS CRYING NOW REAL TEARS THAT STREAMED DOWN HER PALE CHEEKS AND WETTED THE HANDKERCHIEF THAT COVERED THE LOWER PART OF HER FACE
YOUR FRIEND MIGHT HIDE HIMSELF SOMEWHERE ABOUT YOUR PLACE
BUT THIS AGGRAVATING RAIN BALKED EVERYBODY
THE GIRL STOOD WITH HER ELBOW RESTING UPON THE TOP OF THE GATE AND A DARK SHAWL COVERING HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS
HE HAD A MEMORANDUM-BOOK IN HIS HAND--A GREASY AND GRIMY-LOOKING LITTLE VOLUME WHOSE PAGES HE WAS WONT TO STUDY PROFOUNDLY FROM TIME TO TIME AND IN WHICH HE JOTTED DOWN ALL MANNER OF QUEER HIEROGLYPHICS WITH HALF AN INCH OF FAT LEAD-PENCIL
YOU MUST TURN YOUR BACK UPON THE PAST HENRY
THE SAME PATHWAY BY WHICH THE MURDERED MAN HAD GONE TO HIS DEATH
THERE'S FIFTY THOUSAND IN INDIA STOCK MR BALDERBY ANSWERED AS INDIFFERENTLY AS IF FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS MORE OR LESS WAS SCARCELY WORTH SPEAKING OF
WOULD HE HONOUR SIR PHILIP BY ENTRUSTING HIS DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS TO HIS KEEPING
BUT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP HE WAS ONLY THINKING
SCOTTISH HACKBUTS PRIMITIVE ARQUEBUSES THAT HAD DONE SERVICE ON BOSWORTH FIELD HOMERIC BUCKLERS AND BRAZEN GREAVES JAVELINS CROSSBOWS STEEL-POINTED LANCES AND TWO-HANDED SWORDS WERE IN SYMMETRICAL DESIGN UPON THE DARK AND POLISHED PANELS
IT MAY BE THAT THE BANKER'S FACE GREW A SHADE PALER AFTER THAT CONTEMPLATION
CAN THE DOCTOR COME YES
THREE MEN-SERVANTS
I KNOW--AND YOU ARE A BRAVE GIRL A NOBLE GIRL
A GRIMY BRASS PLATE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE BORE ANOTHER INSCRIPTION TO THE SAME EFFECT
OF COURSE
IF IT WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE KNOCKING AND RINGING AT THE HALL-DOOR INSTEAD OF THAT CAUTIOUS SUMMONS
HAPPILY FOR YOU DETECTION HAS SPEEDILY OVERTAKEN YOU
DO YOU REMEMBER IN YOUR DESPAIR APPEALING TO A LAD WHO SERVED YOU AND WHO LOVED YOU BETTER PERHAPS THAN A BROTHER WOULD HAVE LOVED YOU THOUGH HE WAS YOUR INFERIOR BY BIRTH AND STATION AND THE SON OF A POOR HARD-WORKING WOMAN
ABOARD THERE THAT RESOUNDED OVER THE GREAT EXPANSE OF PLASHING WATER
YES THE GENTLEMAN ANSWERED COOLLY
YOU ARE NOT DECEIVING ME SHE SAID
HE HAD HIS FOOT UPON THE LOWEST STEP AND HIS HAND UPON THE DOOR WHEN THE MAJOR WENT UP TO HIM AND TAPPED HIM LIGHTLY UPON THE SHOULDER
IF HE WAS TOO ILL TO GO ON TO SOUTHAMPTON HE WOULD OF COURSE BE TOO ILL TO RETURN TO LONDON HE SAID WITH SUPREME INDIFFERENCE
HE WAITED TILL THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK STRUCK NINE AND THE STARS WERE BRIGHT IN THE DARK BLUE HEAVEN ABOVE HIM
AND HIS UNCLE HUGH WHO WAS THEN CLOSE UPON FIFTY WAS A CONFIRMED BACHELOR,--SO HENRY CONSIDERED HIMSELF HEIR TO AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE AND HE BEGAN HIS CAREER BY SQUANDERING EVERY FARTHING HE COULD GET I SUPPOSE SAID MR BALDERBY
IT IS MARGARET'S HAND SHE EXCLAIMED
BUT PRIOR TO THAT TIME MR DUNBAR SMILED
HE WALKED THROUGH THE AISLE WITH A CARELESS EASY STEP AND WITH HIS HEAD ERECT LOOKING ABOUT HIM AS HE WENT ALONG
YOU ARE GOING TO MEET HIM SAID JOSEPH IN A HOARSE WHISPER
YOU MUST KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
IS IT A SETTLED THING THAT THIS MAN WHO HAS BEEN FOUND MURDERED IS THE PERSON WHO ACCOMPANIED ME TO THIS HOUSE TO-DAY OH YES SIR
HEAVEN GRANT HE MAY RULE HER WISELY AND GENTLY ON THE 17TH OF AUGUST LAURA AND MRS MADDEN ARRIVED IN PORTLAND PLACE
I HAVE SO LOOKED FORWARD TO HIS COMING HOME
THAT THEY HAD APPEARED IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS AND ON EXCELLENT TERMS WITH EACH OTHER
HE WENT TO SCOTLAND YARD DESPAIRING AND LAID HIS CASE BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES THERE
WAS THERE ANY SUCH FEELING NOT ON MY PART WAS THERE ANY SUCH FEELING ON THE PART OF THE DECEASED MR DUNBAR LOOKED FURTIVELY AT WILLIAM BALDERBY
AND YET JAMES WENTWORTH WAS FOND OF HIS ONLY CHILD AFTER A FASHION OF HIS OWN
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT I MUST TELL YOU A LONG STORY AND WHAT'S WORSE STILL A LOVE-STORY I FELT THAT I BLUSHED A LITTLE AS I SAID THIS AND WAS ASHAMED OF THE FALSE SHAME THAT BROUGHT THAT MISSISH GLOW INTO MY CHEEKS
SHE HAS NOT YET ENTERED WHAT SHE CALLS HER TEENS AND TWO YEARS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE SHE CAN ENTER THEM AS SHE IS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD
BUT HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THAT PROMISE HE HAD SOME CLAIM UPON YOU THEN NO HE HAD NO CLAIM WHATEVER UPON ME REPLIED MR DUNBAR HAUGHTILY
THE MURDERER WAS HENRY DUNBAR
AND I AM TO TAKE YOU BEFORE HIM IMMEDIATELY SIR UPON WHAT CHARGE CRIED ARTHUR LOVELL
THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE UPON LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING MORNING
THE CARRIAGE CONVEYED HIM TO THE SHORNCLIFFE STATION
A DISCOVERY AT THE LUXEMBOURG
LET MISS DUNBAR BE TOLD THAT I SHALL NOT SEE HER AGAIN TO-NIGHT AND THAT I SHALL START FOR MAUDESLEY IN THE COURSE OF TO-MORROW
BUT BEFORE THAT TIME I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT MY FATHER
IF THE MAN AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY IS HENRY DUNBAR THERE MUST BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIM BUT HENRY DUNBAR HAS BEEN AWAY FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS HE HAS
CLEMENT AUSTIN HIRED A ROOMY OLD FLY AND CARRIED OFF HIS COMPANIONS TO THE REINDEER
WHY DID I WANT TO FIND THE CLOTHES WORN BY THE MURDERED MAN
IF THE HEARTLESS ASSASSIN OF THIS WRETCHED MAN WAS SUFFERED TO LIVE AND PROSPER TO HOLD UP HIS HEAD AS THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY THE CHIEF PARTNER IN A GREAT CITY FIRM THAT HAD BORNE AN HONOURABLE NAME FOR A CENTURY AND A HALF A KIND OF PREMIUM WAS OFFERED TO CRIME IN HIGH PLACES
BUT THERE WAS A STEADY FIXED RESOLUTE LOOK IN HER WHITE FACE
TRY TO FORGIVE HIM
AND WITH THAT STALWART ALLY HE FELT HIMSELF EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY
ONLY WAIT AND TRUST ME I WILL MY DEAR BOY MRS AUSTIN SAID PRESENTLY
BUT HE WAITED IN VAIN
YOU MIGHT DO THAT EASILY MUTTERED THE SPORTING GENTLEMAN BELOW HIS BREATH
ROUND HIS WAIST HE WORE THE CHAMOIS-LEATHER BELT WHICH HE HAD MADE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AT THE CLARENDON HOTEL
NEW HOPES MAY BLOOM XXI
NO MAGISTRATE IN HIS SENSES WOULD COMMIT THE ANGLO-INDIAN FOR TRIAL UPON SUCH EVIDENCE AS THIS
BUT SHE OPENED A DOOR AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE AND WENT INTO MRS AUSTIN'S ROOM
UNLESS I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN YOU HAVE A MORE THAN ORDINARY REGARD FOR MY DAUGHTER ARTHUR LOVELL WAS SILENT HIS HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY AND HE LOOKED THE BANKER UNFLINCHINGLY IN THE FACE
THE DISAPPOINTED WAITER LINGERED UPON THE DOOR-MAT
A SILVER WATCH PERHAPS
BUT HIS FATHER DIDN'T THINK THE LIKENESS A GOOD ONE AND SENT IT BACK TO THE ARTIST WHO PROMISED TO ALTER AND IMPROVE IT
ALL THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH ARTHUR LOVELL'S MIND AS HE SAT WITH SAMPSON'S FADED LETTER IN HIS HANDS
I LOOKED AT MY WATCH
LET LIGHTS BE CARRIED THERE AND LET THE PORTMANTEAUS AND PACKING-CASES BE UNSTRAPPED AND OPENED HE HANDED A BUNCH OF KEYS TO THE SERVANT AND FOLLOWED THE MAN OUT OF THE ROOM
THE BILLS WERE DULY HONOURED
I WANT YOU TO COMFORT MY POOR GIRL
I SHALL MAKE LISFORD MY QUARTERS FOR THE PRESENT AND I SHALL FOLLOW UP HENRY DUNBAR CHAPTER XXIII
I NEVER HAD ANY HOPE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED ALONG THE SODDENED ROAD BETWEEN THE GATES OF MAUDESLEY AND THE OLD TOWN THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
HE WAS VERY PALE AND THERE WERE STRANGE HARD LINES ABOUT HIS COMPRESSED LIPS AND A NEW LIGHT IN HIS EYES
AS FOR MYSELF I AM ONLY GRADUALLY GROWING RESIGNED TO THE FACT THAT I AM THREE-AND-THIRTY YEARS OF AGE AND THE UNCLE OF A BOUNCING NIECE WHO PLAYS VARIATIONS UPON NON PIU MESTA AND NON PIU MESTA BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER STRANGE FIGURE IN THE NARROW CIRCLE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE
SO DAY AFTER DAY THE YOUNG MAN BOWED DOWN BEFORE THE GODDESS OF HIS LIFE AND WAS HAPPY--AH FATALLY HAPPY!--IN HER SOCIETY
AND HE TOOK IT AWAY TO ITALY WITH HIM PROMISING TO BRING IT BACK TO LONDON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A YEAR OR TWO OF STUDY
MR FREDERICK KERSTALL CONDUCTED HIS GUESTS DOWN THE DINGY STAIRCASE AND SAW THEM TO THE HIRED CARRIAGE THAT WAS WAITING UNDER THE ARCHWAY
PHILIP JOCELYN WAS NO COX-COMB BUT HE KNEW ALL AT ONCE THAT HE WAS BELOVED AND THAT VERY FEW WORDS WERE NEEDED
IT IS A COMMON THING FOR ANGLO-INDIANS TO BE QUIET AND RESERVED IN THEIR MANNERS AND STRONGLY ADVERSE TO ALL DEMONSTRATIONS OF THIS KIND
AND THE YOUNG LAWYER HAD NO ALTERNATIVE
AND HORSE AND MAN WERE AT THE SERVICE OF THE BANKER AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT
THEY HAVE BEEN TO WINCHESTER
ONE OCTAGONAL TOWER WITH A BATTLEMENTED ROOF STILL STOOD ALMOST AS FIRMLY AS IT HAD STOOD IN THE DAYS OF THE EARLY PLANTAGENETS WHEN REBEL SOLDIERS HAD TRIED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR BATTERING-RAMS AGAINST THE GRIM STONE WALLS
WAIT AND SEE HE SAID
THE FACTS OF THE CASE WERE VERY SIMPLE AND SPEEDILY ELICITED
BUT I SHALL KEEP MY EYE UPON HIM MY FAITH IS STRONG IN TIME AS THE POET OBSERVES
HE DRANK THE SODA-WATER AND BRANDY
AH BUT YES MONSIEUR THE PAINTER ANSWERED WITH ANIMATED POLITENESS
IF THIS IS TRUE NO OBSTACLE ON EARTH SHALL PART US SO LONG AS WE LIVE
OH FATHER,--DEAREST FATHER SHE CRIED SUDDENLY THROWING ASIDE HER WORK AND DROPPING ON HER KNEES BESIDE THE MAN'S CHAIR I DO NOT ASK FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE IF IT IS PAINFUL TO YOU TO GIVE IT
THEN MR HUGH ASKED HIM WHETHER THE FORGED SIGNATURE WAS HIS OWN DOING OR THE WORK OF ANY BODY ELSE
IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU ARE IN ANY WAY DISTRESSED--AND YOU MUST MOST LIKELY NEED ASSISTANCE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS--HE IS QUITE READY TO HELP YOU
SHE DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE AN IMPOSTOR PERHAPS NOT ANSWERED MR DUNBAR HAUGHTILY
EVIDENCE AGAINST MR DUNBAR MISS HE SAID
THIS WAS THE LAST OF MANY DREAMS ALL MORE OR LESS GROTESQUE OR HORRIBLE BUT NONE SO VIVID OR DISTINCT AS THIS
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU VERY SERIOUSLY SIR HE SAID
BUT MR KERSTALL WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN ARRANGE THIS FOR ME MR AUSTIN CLEMENT AUSTIN READILY PROMISED TO BRING ABOUT AN APPARENTLY ACCIDENTAL MEETING BETWEEN MARGARET AND MR DUNBAR AND THIS IS HOW IT WAS THAT JOSEPH WILMOT'S DAUGHTER HAD WAITED IN THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
BUT I WILL NOT BE BORED OR TORMENTED BY ANY MAN ALIVE
IS THIS BUSINESS OF TO-DAY THEN A PART OF YOUR SECRET IT IS ANSWERED THE CASHIER
HE HAD SPOKEN WITH HIS HEAD STILL BENT AND HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
MR CARTER LOOKED AT HIS WATCH WHILE THE GIRL MADE HER CONFESSION
THE FRACTURE OF THE LEG WAS VERY SIMPLE
THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE SCREENED HER IN SOME WISE FROM THE MAN IN THE PORCH WHO NEVER HAPPENED TO ROLL HIS LANGUID EYES TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE WAS STANDING
HUMAN GROANS STIFLED UNDER THE WRECKS OF SHIVERED CARRIAGES
THE NEWSPAPER RECORD TOLD HOW THE MURDERED MAN HAD ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT MET HIS BROTHER AT THE WATERLOO STATION UPON THE AFTERNOON OF THE 16TH OF AUGUST
PROVIDED THAT SHE MARRIED AN HONEST MAN MR DUNBAR GAVE A WEARY KIND OF SIGH AS HE SAID THIS
THE BYSTANDERS REPEATED THIS TO ONE ANOTHER AS THEY FOLLOWED MR DUNBAR AND HIS CUSTODIAN FROM THE STATION LOUDLY INDIGNANT AGAINST THE MINIONS OF THE LAW
I CAN'T LOOK FORWARD
I AM AS IGNORANT AS YOU ARE I SAID
HE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO SELL THEM OF COURSE
YOU ONLY LOVE ME AS A BROTHER LAURA HOW ELSE SHOULD I LOVE YOU SHE ASKED INNOCENTLY
THE BANKER APPEARED SO VERY SELDOM IN PUBLIC THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A KIND OF CURIOSITY ABOUT HIM WHEN HE DID SHOW HIMSELF
NO MISS DUNBAR--NO LADY JOCELYN I HAVE NO NEW TROUBLE TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU
BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT HE LOOKED AT HENRY DUNBAR AS IF SCARCELY KNOWING HOW TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE
HE WILL COME HOME FROM INDIA NOW I DARE SAY AND THE WORLD WILL BE UNDER HIS FEET
WHEN THE LANDLORD AND THE WAITERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT A GOOD DEAL WE BEGIN TO WARM UP AND TAKE A KIND OF MORBID INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS
IT'S A MORIEL IMPOSSIBLE AS YOU CAN LOOK YOUR BEST MY PRECIOUS LOVE IF YOU ENTER THE CHURCH IN A STATE OF STARVATION JUST LIKE ONE OF THEM RESPECTABLE BEGGARS WOT PINS A PIECE OF PAPER ON THEIR WESKITS WITH I AM HUNGRY WROTE UPON IT IN LARGE HAND AND STANDS AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE BRIDGES ON THE SURREY SIDE OF THE WATER
ALL WAS DARK AND QUIET IN THE HOUSE FOR THE MISTRESS OF IT WAS ELDERLY-AND OLD-FASHIONED IN HER WAYS
AND HE TOLD ME THAT MY HEART IS DISEASED AND THAT IF I WISH TO LIVE I MUST AVOID ANY AGITATION ANY SUDDEN EMOTION AS I WOULD AVOID A DEADLY POISON
THE VAGABOND WITH HIS HAT SLOUCHED OVER HIS EYES AND BIG HANDS IN HIS POCKETS STROLLED AWAY FROM THE HIGH STREET DOWN TO A BARBER'S SHOP NEAR THE DOCKS
IT CAME AT LAST
I EXPECTED ANY QUANTITY OF COLD WATER
SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS WITH A RADIANT SMILE AND PUTTING UP HER HANDS DREW HIS FACE ROUND AND PRESSED HER LIPS TO HIS
AND ONCE MORE--GOOD NIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO LONDON YES--TO CASH THE CHEQUES AND MAKE A FEW BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS MR DUNBAR BOLTED THE GREAT DOOR AS THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FRIEND THE MAJOR DIED AWAY UPON THE GRAVELLED WALK WHICH HAD BEEN QUICKLY DRIED BY THE FROSTY WIND
I DID NOT SAY I CAME FROM THE OFFICE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
LAURA PRESSED THE SPEAKER'S COLD HAND
THERE WERE WORN AND SHABBY GARMENTS TUMBLED AND DUSTY THAT HAD BEEN THROWN PELL-MELL INTO THE BOX
PROUD AND SELFISH AND CRUEL THEN--PROUD AND SELFISH AND CRUEL NOW
THAT HAS BEEN ALL SETTLED THE LADIES AND THE YOUNG LAWYER TOOK AN AFTERNOON TEA TOGETHER BEFORE THEY LEFT MAUDESLEY AND WERE ALTOGETHER VERY SOCIABLE NOT TO SAY MERRY
BUT SHE COULD NOT DISPOSSESS HERSELF OF THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS GUILTY
I NEVER SET EYES UPON YOU BEFORE
MY DAUGHTER IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IF SHE IS LIKE THAT SAID THE BANKER
ILL--WORN OUT KNOCKED UP BY OVER-WORK
THE JOURNEY FROM SHORNCLIFFE TO DERBY SEEMED ALMOST ENTIRELY TO CONSIST OF CHANGING HERE AND POOR MR CARTER FELT AS IF HE HAD PASSED A LONG NIGHT IN BEING HUSTLED OUT OF ONE CARRIAGE INTO ANOTHER AND OFF ONE LINE OF RAILWAY ON TO ANOTHER WITH ALL THOSE PAUSES ON DRAUGHTY PLATFORMS WHICH ARE SO REFRESHING TO THE WORN-OUT TRAVELLER WHO WORKS HIS WEARY WAY ACROSS COUNTRY IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT
UNTIL NOW HE HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY ANXIOUSLY
YOU'VE NOT GONE THEN MISS HE EXCLAIMED
I'VE SEEN HIM MANY A TIME IMITATE THE SIGNATURE OF THIS FIRM AND OTHER SIGNATURES UPON A HALF-SHEET OF LETTER-PAPER FOR THE MERE FUN OF THE THING
THERE WAS NOT A RAY OF SUNSHINE IN THE DENSE GREY SKY AND THE FLAT LANDSCAPE BEYOND THE CATHEDRAL SEEMED ALMOST BLOTTED OUT BY THE DRIZZLING RAIN
AND YOU MAY RELY UPON IT I SHALL SUCCEED IN FINDING THE MISSING MAN YOU DO NOT THINK THAT--THAT UNDER SOME TERRIBLE HALLUCINATION THE RESULT OF HIS LONG ILLNESS--YOU DON'T THINK THAT HE HAS COMMITTED SUICIDE NO LADY JOCELYN ANSWERED THE DETECTIVE DECISIVELY THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FROM MY THOUGHTS NOW THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT AND NOW MY LADY MAY I ASK IF YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LET ME SEE MR DUNBAR'S VALET AND TO LEAVE ME ALONE WITH HIM IN THESE ROOMS
THOSE SHARP EAGER BLACK EYES TOOK NOTICE OF EVERYTHING
YOUR POOR FATHER'S MEMORY DECEIVES HIM SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
TO BE SURE SIR HE SAID
THERE'S A WOMAN'S HEART IN THAT LETTER
MY POOR FATHER
AND YOU'VE A RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF IT AS YOU PLEASE
DARLING PAPA SHE CRIED IMPETUOUSLY
MISS WILSON LIVED WITH HER PAPA DID SHE I ASKED
BUT WHO CARES WHAT BECAME OF JOSEPH WILMOT EXCEPT HIS DAUGHTER
GOOD-BYE HE SAID
FROM SUCH A REVERIE AS THIS THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY WAS SUDDENLY AROUSED BY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT KNOCKING AGAINST ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF HIS ROOM--THE WINDOW NEAREST HIM AS HE LAY ON THE COUCH
HE WENT TO HIS DOOM AS THE FOOLISH MOTH FLIES TO THE CANDLE
HIS COMPANION'S READY WIT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD--THE VERY WORST PART OF THE WORLD UNHAPPILY--AMUSED THE LANGUID ANGLO-INDIAN
HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD TEMPER HOWEVER FOR HE HAD WON WHAT HIS COMPANIONS CALLED A HATFUL OF MONEY ON THE STEEPLE-CHASE AND HE STOOD TO WIN ON OTHER RACES THAT WERE TO COME OFF THAT AFTERNOON
BUT I DO LOVE HER NEVERTHELESS MR DUNBAR SPOKE VERY SLOWLY HERE AND STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO PASS HIS HANDKERCHIEF ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AS HE HAD DONE IN THE HOTEL AT WINCHESTER
THE POLICE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THE MURDERER BUT WITHOUT RESULT
COME AND HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST DO THAT'S A DEAR SWEET LOVE AND TRY A NEW-LAID EGG
MRS PARKYN THOUGHT IT BEST TO PREPARE THESE ROOMS FOR YOUR OCCUPATION HENRY DUNBAR LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY ROUND THE SPACIOUS CHAMBER
THERE HE ENTERED A LOW-ROOFED LITTLE PUBLIC-HOUSE VERY QUIET AND UNFREQUENTED ORDERED SOME BRANDY AND COLD WATER OF A GIRL WHO WAS SEATED AT WORK BEHIND THE BAR AND THEN WENT INTO THE PARLOUR,--A LOW-CEILINGED WAINSCOTED ROOM WHOSE WALLS WERE ADORNED HERE AND THERE WITH AUCTIONEERS ANNOUNCEMENTS OF COMING SALES OF LIVE AND DEAD STOCK FARM-HOUSES AND FARMING IMPLEMENTS INTERSPERSED WITH RAILWAY TIME-TABLES
THE SUPERCILIOUS FOOTMAN WHO ADMITTED HIM TO THE HALL SEEMED DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE SHOULD ADMIT HIM ANY FARTHER
YOU'LL FIND EM ALL MORE OR LESS GENTLEMANLY YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T REMEMBER PAINTING THE PORTRAIT OF A MR DUNBAR MR KERSTALL THE YOUNGER SAID BENDING OVER HIS FATHER'S CHAIR AS HE SPOKE
FRIENDLY AS WE ARE I CAN NEVER INDUCE HER TO LET ME SEE HER HOME THOUGH MY MOTHER HAS SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD DO SO
YES SIR
YES SIR
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF IT BEFORE BUT NEVER THE WHOLE TRUTH
MY FATHER KEPT TWO ACCOUNTS HERE I BELIEVE--A DEPOSIT AND A DRAWING ACCOUNT HE DID AND THOSE TWO ACCOUNTS HAVE GONE ON SINCE MY RETURN IN THE SAME MANNER AS DURING HIS LIFETIME PRECISELY
BUT I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT THIS TALK ABOUT THE MURDERED MAN'S MANNER AND APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT AS USELESS AS ANYTHING COULD BE
BUT MR DUNBAR DID NOT CONDESCEND TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE YOUNG MAN'S REMONSTRANCE
AND LOOKED AT IN THIS LIGHT THE RUE CAILOUX WAS A TRIUMPH
I DIDN'T KEEP NO PARTICULAR COUNT OF THE TIME ARTHUR LOVELL HAD TAKEN OUT HIS POCKET-BOOK AND WAS MAKING NOTES OF THE VERGER'S EVIDENCE
HE WAS MORE WARMLY INTERESTED IN A STEEPLECHASE ON SHORNCLIFFE COMMON THAN IN A PAMPHLET ON POLITICAL ECONOMY EVEN THOUGH MR STUART MILL SHOULD HIMSELF BE THE AUTHOR OF THE BROCHURE
GO BACK FOR THE LAMP MARGARET JOSEPH WILMOT WHISPERED
I'M AFRAID MY FATHER'S PICTURE HAS BEEN LOST OR DESTROYED SHE SAID MOURNFULLY
IN ONE OF THESE COTTAGES A YOUNG LADY LIVED WITH HER FATHER
I AM TOLD THERE IS A YOUNG MAN CALLED MILLAIS SIR AND ANOTHER YOUNG MAN CALLED HOLMAN HUNT SIR,--POSITIVE BOYS SIR
I ONLY WANT YOUR LOVE MR DUNBAR DID NOT MAKE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT ENTREATING WHISPER
HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH WHILE DRESSING AND FOUND THAT IT WAS BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
THE PAWNBROKERS AND OTHERS THINK OUR ADVERTISEMENT A PLANT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT CHAPTER XLVI
BUT I TELL YOU I CAN'T
YOU CAN CASH THAT CHEQUE IN THE MEANTIME AND ASCERTAIN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE TO DEAL
AND YET THIS MAN RECALLS HIM TO ME SOMEHOW
I STILL WALKED UP AND DOWN UNDER THE DRIPPING TREES IN THE DARKNESS AS I HAD WALKED IN THE LIGHT
EVERY TENDER WORD YOU HAVE EVER SPOKEN TO ME--EVERY TREMULOUS CADENCE IN YOUR LOW VOICE--EVERY TEARFUL LOOK IN THE EYES THAT HAVE SEEMED SO TRUTHFUL--ALL--IT HAS ALTOGETHER BEEN FALSE--ALTOGETHER A DELUSION--A THE STRONG MAN COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AND SOBBED ALOUD
WHAT SHOULD ANY YOUNG PERSON WANT WITH ME SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU PARTICULARLY SIR
STRANGE MEMORIES CAME BACK TO HIM AS HE LAY STARING AT THE RED CHASMS AND CRAGGY STEEPS IN THE FIRE--MEMORIES OF A TIME SO LONG GONE BY THAT ALL THE PERSONAGES OF THAT PERIOD SEEMED TO HIM LIKE THE CHARACTERS IN A BOOK OR THE FIGURES IN A PICTURE
AND IF HE HAD SEEN FIT TO TURN HER OUT OF DOORS AND ASK HER TO BEG BY HIS SIDE IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY I DOUBT IF SHE WOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED SOME HIDDEN WISDOM LURKING AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS APPARENTLY IRRATIONAL PROCEEDINGS
THERE WAS TO BE NO FUSS NO PUBLICITY
HE HAD WANTED TO GO ABROAD--TO GO UPON A JOURNEY--THAT WAS NO NEW PURPOSE IN HIS MIND
THE WOMAN AT THE LODGE WAS NOT ALONE
BUT TO-NIGHT SHE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM BEFORE THE WIDOW COULD REMONSTRATE WITH HER
I CONFESS THAT I GROANED ALOUD WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED UPON THE MAN AND I FOUND MYSELF ALONE WITH THE DETECTIVE WHO HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT THE LITTLE TABLE AND WAS PORING OVER ONE OF THE SHIRTS OUTSPREAD BEFORE HIM
MARGARET WAS PERHAPS WRONG AFTER ALL AND HENRY DUNBAR MIGHT BE AN INNOCENT MAN
SHE WALKED BY CLEMENT'S SIDE DOWN TO THE PATHWAY BY THE RIVER WHICH WAS LONELY ENOUGH AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT
DO NOT TALK OF REVENGE
I PICKED UP THE SHEET OF PAPER AND FOLDED IT NEATLY
LET THE MARRIAGE TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST WEEK IN NOVEMBER HE SAID
HE IS THE SON OF AN OLD MONSIEUR WHO CALLS HIMSELF ALSO KERSTALL AND WHO HAD MUCH OF CELEBRITY IN ENGLAND IT IS MANY YEARS KERSTALL EXCLAIMED LAURA SUDDENLY
A FAVOURITE MASTIFF STRETCHED FULL LENGTH UPON THE HEARTH
THE MAJOR USUALLY SOMEWHAT SILENT AND MOROSE CONTRIVED TO MAKE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE TO THE JOVIAL FREQUENTERS OF THE COMFORTABLE LITTLE PUBLIC PARLOUR OF THE ROSE AND CROWN
BUT MR DUNBAR IS RARE AND DIFFICULT TO PLEASE IT SEEMS
SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HER MONEY
JUST YOU COME HERE HERE WAS THE WINDOW BEFORE WHICH MR CARTER PLANTED HIMSELF
WHO HAD MY FATHER TO LOVE HIM AND REMEMBER HIM IN ALL THE WORLD BUT ME
BUT WHY ARE YOU SO ANXIOUS TO SEE THIS OLD PORTRAIT OF YOUR FATHER MY DEAR BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHAT HE WAS BEFORE HE WENT TO INDIA
I TRIUMPHED
MR DUNBAR HAD GIVEN ALL NECESSARY DIRECTIONS FOR THE RECEPTION OF HIS SHABBY FRIEND
WHEN ALL WAS OVER AND THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES IN THE VESTRY BEFORE ADMIRING WITNESSES THE SPORTING GENTLEMAN ROSE AND WALKED SOFTLY OUT OF THE PEW AND ALONG ONE OF THE OBSCURE SIDE-AISLES
AND THEN IT HAD COME IN A CALM AND SOLEMN SHAPE IN THE DEATH OF AN OLD MAN WHO ENDED A GOOD AND PROSPEROUS LIFE PEACEFULLY UPON THE BREAST OF HIS BELOVED GRANDDAUGHTER
YOU'LL FIND A COAT LINED WITH FUR ON A CHAIR IN THE BEDROOM HIS DAUGHTER OBEYED SILENTLY AND QUIETLY AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE
AMONGST THEM HE FOUND A MAN WHOSE FACE WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE CABIN-WALL BUT WHO WORE A BLUE COAT AND A TRAVELLER'S CAP OF FUR SHAPED LIKE A TEMPLAR'S HELMET AND TIED DOWN OVER HIS EARS
ALAS
BUT HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MURDERED
POOR CLEMENT FELL ASLEEP AND DREAMT THAT HE MET MARGARET WILMOT BY MOONLIGHT IN THE PARK AROUND MAUDESLEY ABBEY WALKING WITH A DEAD MAN WHOSE FACE WAS STRANGE TO HIM
HE FOLLOWED HER BUT SHE STILL RECOILED FROM HIM AND AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO GRASP HER WRIST SHE SLIPPED BY HIM SUDDENLY AND RUSHED AWAY TOWARDS THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
YOU SHALL NOT GO THUS MARGARET WILMOT HE CRIED PASSIONATELY--"NOT THUS
HE ASKED SOME QUESTIONS OF THE PORTER AND LEFT HIS PORTMANTEAU IN THE MAN'S CARE WHILE HE WENT TO GET HIS TICKET
HE ONLY WANTED THE SACRED WORDS TO BE SPOKEN WHICH MADE LAURA DUNBAR HIS OWN FOR EVER AND FOR EVER
FOR THE FOOTMAN HAD DISTINCTLY DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN HIS MASTER'S VISITOR LEAVE THE HOUSE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ASSAULTING AND BALLYRAGGING ME IN THIS WAY
AND I DO NOT REALLY SEE WHAT GOOD COULD POSSIBLY ARISE OUT OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU
THE LANDLORD OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT UPON THE BROAD LANDING-PLACE FOLLOWED BY MR DUNBAR
I WILL GO TO INDIA HE SAID
BUT I CAN SCARCELY REMEMBER THAT SAD TIME
IS THIS MY TRAIN LOVELL HE ASKED
THE GIRL LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EARNEST QUESTIONING GLANCE
WELL IT IS STRANGE SIR TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT
YOU SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT BY-AND-BY
I WHEELED A COMFORTABLE CHAIR UP TO THE DESK AND BEGAN MY TASK
THIS FACT BECAME UNIVERSALLY KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE PARISH OF LISFORD AND TWO NEIGHBOURING PARISHES BEFORE THE SHADOWS OF NIGHT CAME DOWN UPON THE DAY OF LAURA DUNBAR'S WEDDING AND THE MAJOR WAS RESPECTED ACCORDINGLY
I MUST RIDE LAURA AND RIDE TO WIN TOO MISS DUNBAR KNEW WHAT THIS LAST PHRASE MEANT AND SHE CONJURED UP THE IMAGE OF HER LOVER FLYING ACROSS COUNTRY ON THAT FIERY CHESTNUT MARE WHOSE REPUTATION WAS FAMILIAR TO ALMOST EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN WARWICKSHIRE
MARRIAGE WAS A VERY SOLEMN BUSINESS MR DUNBAR SAID AND IT WOULD BE AS WELL FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE UNDISTURBED BY ANY POMP OR GAIETY ON HER WEDDING-DAY
OH RESERVOIR AS WE SAY IN THE CLASSICS MAJOR VERNON EXTENDED A BRAWNY HAND OF RATHER DOUBTFUL PURITY
AFTER FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS ABSENCE HE WILL BE A PERFECT STRANGER IN ENGLAND AND WILL REQUIRE A BUSINESS MAN ABOUT HIM TO MANAGE MATTERS FOR HIM AND TAKE ALL TROUBLE OFF HIS HANDS
HE HAD AN INSURMOUNTABLE TERROR OF SEEING THIS GIRL BECAUSE HE WAS THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER
I WILL NOT SEE HER
AND HIS PICTURES WERE ALTOGETHER OF THE ORDER WHICH UNSOPHISTICATED PEOPLE ADMIRE AND CALL PRETTY HE WAS A VERY CHEERFUL YOUNG MAN AND PERHAPS THAT CHEERFULNESS WAS THE GREATEST CHARM HE POSSESSED
CLEMENT SAT WITH THE WINDOW DOWN AND THE FROSTY WIND BLOWING FULL UPON HIS FACE AS HE LOOTED OUT FOR MARGARET
MISS LAURA DUNBAR WILL COME UP TO TOWN TO MEET HER FATHER AT THE HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE
HE HAD ENTERED WINCHESTER UPON THAT AUGUST AFTERNOON WITH A FEW SOVEREIGNS AND A HANDFUL OF SILVER IN HIS POCKET AND WITH A LIFE OF POVERTY AND DEGRADATION BEFORE HIM
THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY WAS IN NO WAY IMPROVED BY HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LONDON TO YOUR OLD APARTMENTS AT CLAPHAM OH NO NO HAVE YOU MONEY--MONEY ENOUGH TO LAST YOU FOR SOME TIME YES
BUT NOW NOW THAT I KNEW THE SHAME AND ANGUISH WHICH OUR DISCOVERY MUST INEVITABLY ENTAIL UPON THE WOMAN I LOVED MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AND I HATED MR CARTER FOR HIS ARDENT ENJOYMENT OF HIS TRIUMPH
IF HE HAD BEEN THE VAINEST OF MEN BENT ON NO HIGHER OBJECT IN LIFE THAN THE EMBELLISHMENT OF HIS PERSON HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PARTICULAR OR MORE DIFFICULT TO PLEASE
CLEMENT AUSTIN FELL IN LOVE WITH MARGARET WILMOT
I ONLY KNOW THAT AFTER TEN MINUTES CONVERSATION DURING WHICH SHE WAS PERFECTLY SELF-POSSESSED I OPENED THE LITTLE GARDEN-GATE AGAIN VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY THE LATCH ON ONE HAND AND MY HAT ON THE OTHER AND WENT BACK OUT OF THAT LITTLE PARADISE OF TWENTY FEET SQUARE INTO THE DUSTY LANE
HER TONES HAD NEVER FALTERED
HE WAS VERY PALE
HE WAS VERY PALE
WE WERE YOUNG MEN TOGETHER
THE WINDOWS OF MR DUNBAR'S BEDROOM AND DRESSING-ROOM OPENED INTO A CLOISTERED COURT BENEATH WHOSE SOLEMN SHADOW THE HOODED MONKS HAD SLOWLY PACED IN DAYS THAT WERE LONG GONE
AND THE BLACK-BEARDED GENTLEMAN STANDING BEHIND HIS CHAIR WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MEMBER OF THE PRE-RAPHAELITE BROTHERHOOD
THE TRAIN FROM SHORNCLIFFE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY SMASHED
I SHALL BE VERY BUSY THIS EVENING MR LOVELL SAID HENRY DUNBAR PRESENTLY
HEAVEN IS VERY MERCIFUL
THERE WAS A QUIET EARNESTNESS IN HER VOICE
HAVE YOU NO AMBITION GIRL PLENTY FATHER SHE ANSWERED LIFTING HER EYES FROM HER WORK AND LOOKING AT HIM MOURNFULLY
WE TOOK AN EARLY AND HASTY BREAKFAST
HINDERED BY THE FANCY THAT MR CARTER'S SEARCH WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING SUCCESSFUL
WHICH THE GROOM SAYS HE HAVE RODE RAMPAGEOUS OR THE GRAVEL WOULDN'T BE TORE UP AS IT IS
FOR I KNEW THAT IN A CASE OF THIS KIND EVERY INSIGNIFICANT STEP ENTAILED THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY
HE WILL NOT DARE TO REFUSE YOU CLEMENT AUSTIN SAID
SHE WAS VERY VERY PALE NOW AND TREMBLED VIOLENTLY
BEYOND THIS HOLY SHELTER FAIR PASTURES STRETCH AWAY TO THE FEET OF THE GRASSY HILLS
HIS CLOTHES WERE VERY SHABBY WITH THAT PECULIAR SHINY SHABBINESS WHICH MAKES A MAN LOOK AS IF HE HAD BEEN OILED ALL OVER AND THEN RUBBED INTO A HIGH STATE OF POLISH
IF HENRY DUNBAR WAS PALE HENRY DUNBAR'S LEGAL ADVISER WAS STILL MORE SO
GENEROUS AND OPEN-HANDED WITH MONEY
HE COULD NOT READ
BUT THAT THE BANKER SHOULD RESORT TO A COWARDLY STRATAGEM TO ESCAPE FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GIRL COULD SCARCELY BE ACCOUNTED FOR EXCEPT BY THE FACT OF HIS GUILT
UNTIL THIS MOMENT HIS MIND HAD BEEN RACKED IN AGONIZING DOUBTS
HE WAS SMOKING A CIGAR AND SWINGING HIS GOLD-HEADED CANE LIGHTLY AS HE CAME ALONG
WHEN I WAS ALONE I RENDERED UP MY THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR THE ESCAPE OF JOSEPH WILMOT
DON'T WRITE THEM DOWN FOR THEY'RE OF NO ACCOUNT
DURING ALL THAT TIME IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE WAS ANY CHANCE HOWEVER REMOTE OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S ESCAPE FROM HIS PURSUER
BUT THERE'S ALL MANNER OF HOLES ABOUT
AT ANY SACRIFICE HE MUST BE SAVED FROM THAT
AND YOU'D WISH PERHAPS TO SEE A FEW SPECIMENS HE UNLOCKED ONE OF THE IRON SAFES AS HE SPOKE AND BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF LITTLE PAPER PACKETS WHICH WERE FOLDED IN A PECULIAR FASHION AND WHICH HE OPENED WITH VERY GINGERLY FINGERS
A MAN WEARING A DARK BLUE COAT LINED WITH SABLE AND WALKING VERY LAME MUST BE A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT WHEREVER HE WENT
NOW LISTEN TO ME SAID MR DUNBAR
JOSEPH WILMOT LOOKED ABOUT THE SHOP
AND WE'VE COME DOWN TO SPEND AN IDLE WEEK OR SO AND HAVE A LOOK ABOUT THE PLACE AGAINST NEXT SUMMER
THE MAN WHO HAD FALLEN HEAD-OVER-HEELS IN LOVE WITH THE PRETTY MUSIC-MISTRESS BUT WHO FELT HALF ASHAMED OF HIS SUDDEN AND UNREASONING AFFECTION
I WANT TO SEE THE CAPTAIN WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HIM THAT'S MY BUSINESS ANOTHER MAN WITH A DINGY FACE AND ANOTHER PIPE IN HIS MOUTH LOOKED OVER THE SIDE AND TOOK HIS PIPE FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS TO ADDRESS THE DETECTIVE
THE CANDLES WERE BURNT DOWN AND THE FLAMES FLICKERED SLOWLY OUT IN THE SILVER SOCKETS
WHETHER THIS CHANGE WAS NATURAL TO HIM AND MERELY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE ALTERATION IN HIS HAIR AND BEARD OR WHETHER IT WAS AN ASSUMPTION OF HIS OWN WAS ONLY KNOWN TO THE MAN HIMSELF
WHY DID HE NOT IMMEDIATELY MAKE AN OFFER OF HIS HAND TO LAURA DUNBAR
YES MR WILMOT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU
HE HAD HEARD OF THE BANKER'S INTENDED VISIT TO ST GUNDOLPH LANE AND HAD LOOKED FORWARD WITH STRANGE ANXIETY TO A MEETING WITH THE MAN WHOM MARGARET WILMOT DECLARED TO BE THE MURDERER OF HER FATHER
AS MR CARTER SAID THOSE TWO WORDS FOUR O'CLOCK HIS TEETH MADE A LITTLE CLICKING NOISE UPON THE AMBER MOUTHPIECE OF THE PIPE
ONLY ONE FRIEND THAT WAS AT ALL INTIMATE WITH YOUR MASTER AND THAT WAS A GENTLEMAN CALLED VERNON LATELY COME TO LIVE AT WOODBINE COTTAGE LISFORD ROAD
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE MARGARET WILMOT KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO HAVE FRIENDS REAL AND EARNEST FRIENDS WHO INTERESTED THEMSELVES IN HER WELFARE AND WERE BENT UPON SECURING HER HAPPINESS
AND WE COMES TO HULL AND I SEES HIM GET OUT ON THE PLATFORM AND I SEES HIM INTO A FLY AND I HEARS HIM GIVE THE ORDER VICTORIER HOTEL WHICH BY THIS TIME IT'S NIGH UPON TEN O'CLOCK AND DARK AND WINDY
THERE WAS A SUDDEN COMMOTION ON THE DECK A SIMULTANEOUS SHOUT AS THE MEN RUSHED TO THE SIDE
THIS MAN WAS A REPROBATE
WHY DO I STOP TALKING LIKE THIS
AND IF EVER HE DOES WANT ME EGAD HE SHALL PAY ME MY OWN PRICE AND IT SHALL BE RATHER A STIFF ONE INTO THE BARGAIN CHAPTER XXIX
I MUST ASK YOU TO LOOK ME FULL IN THE FACE MISS WILMOT HE ADDED LAUGHINGLY DRAWING HER TOWARDS HIM AS HE SPOKE
SHE WENT BACK TO HIM CARRYING THE BULKY OVERCOAT AND HELPED HIM TO PUT IT ON IN PLACE OF THE DRESSING-GROWN HE HAD BEEN WEARING
CLEMENT TOOK THE SLENDER HAND IN HIS
S ELECTRIC STEAMERS TO FEEL THE ICY SPRAY DASHING INTO HIS FACE AND TO SEE THE TOWN OF DOVER SHINING LIKE A FLAMING CRESCENT AGAINST THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AND THE CALAIS LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE RISING UP BEHIND THE BLACK EDGE OF THE SEA
IT WON'T SERVE HIS TURN TO RUN AWAY WHILE MAJOR VERNON WENT BACK TO LISFORD HENRY DUNBAR TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE WITH LAURA LADY JOCELYN BY HIS SIDE
IT'S MASTER
HE COULD NOT REMAIN IN THIS MAN'S SERVICE AND YET AT THE SAME TIME PLAY THE SPY UPON HIS ACTIONS AND WORK HEART AND SOUL TO DRAG THE DREADFUL SECRET OF HIS LIFE INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY
WE TALK OF BOOKS
SO MARGARET ASKED THE FIRST PASSER-BY TO DIRECT HER TO THE GEORGE
THE CHURCHYARD WAS DENSELY CROWDED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PATHWAY ALONG WHICH THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM WALKED
YES I AM VERY LATE MOTHER I KNOW HE SAID
BUT SHE WAS NOT ALARMED FOR HIS PERSONAL SAFETY SHE WAS ONLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM
HE PAID A TERRIBLE PENALTY FOR EVERY HAPPY HOUR EVERY DELICIOUS DAY OF SIMPLE AND INNOCENT ENJOYMENT THAT HE HAD SPENT AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
YOU SEE I'M ALL RIGHT MYSELF AND THE MARE'S IN SPLENDID CONDITION;--WELL YOU SAW HER TAKE HER TRIAL GALLOP THE OTHER MORNING AND YOU MUST KNOW SHE'S A FLYER SO I WON'T TALK ABOUT HER
SHE GAVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME AND HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER IN SETTING HER TONGUE IN MOTION UPON THE SUBJECT OF HENRY DUNBAR
THE CHURCHYARD WAS A SQUARE FLAT SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY A LOW STONE WALL BEYOND WHICH THE FIELDS SLOPED DOWN TO THE MOUTH OF A RIVER THAT WIDENED INTO THE SEA AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM KYLMINGTON BUT WHICH HEREABOUTS HAD A VERY DINGY MELANCHOLY LOOK WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT AS IT WAS TO-NIGHT
IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO REMAIN IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION
IT MAY BE A JACK-O'-LANTERN
SAWNEY'S GOT THE CHANCE THIS TIME HE THOUGHT
HE KNELT DOWN ONCE MORE BY THE SIDE OF THE PORTMANTEAU AND TORE OFF THE LABEL WITH HIS BROTHER'S NAME UPON IT
SHE TOOK THE FIRST TRAIN TO WINCHESTER AND REACHED THE STATION TWO HOURS BEFORE NOON
CONTENTS CHAPTER I
WILL BE MET BY MISS LAURA D
IN SINCERE ADMIRATION OF HIS GENIUS AS A DRAMATIC AUTHOR AND POPULAR ACTOR
SHE HAS GIVEN ME NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH HER
THE GIRL'S SAD FACE SEEMED SOFTLY LUMINOUS WITH THE TENDER LIGHT OF PURE AND HOLY THOUGHTS
TO HAVE BEEN HOODWINKED BY A GIRL WHOSE DEVOTION TO THE UNHAPPY WRETCH SHE CALLED HER FATHER HAD TRANSFORMED HER INTO A HEROINE--TO HAVE FALLEN SO EASILY INTO THE TRAP THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HIM BEING ALL THE WHILE PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SENSE OF HIS OWN CLEVERNESS--WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT DEPRESSING TO THE SPIRITS OF A FIRST-CLASS DETECTIVE
THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE FERNS IS THE PATHWAY THROUGH THE GROVE BETWEEN HERE AND ST CROSS
GET INTO MY CARRIAGE AND I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME
CHAPTER XXII
FIRST AS CLERK AFTERWARDS AS CHIEF AND MANAGER
THE BEAUTIFUL FACE WAS IN SHADOW AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
HEAVEN KNOWS TO WHAT AMOUNT SUCH PAPER AS THAT MAY BE IN CIRCULATION
SUPPOSE HE WAS TO SELL ME AND GO IN FOR THE REWARD THE SUPPOSITION WAS NOT A PLEASANT ONE AND MR CARTER LOOKED GRAVE FOR A MINUTE OR SO
WHICH SEEMED ALL IN ONE VOICE THOUGH IT WAS IN REALITY A BLENDING OF MANY VOICES
HE HAD MEANT TO DO THIS AND HAD CALCULATED THAT HIS CONDUCT WOULD BE AT THE WORST CONSIDERED ECCENTRIC
CHAPTER XIX
HE ALWAYS ACTED AS POOR GRANDPAPA'S SOLICITOR
BUT AGAIN I HAD GOOD REASON TO ATTRIBUTE THESE FANCIES TO THE STATE OF MY OWN BRAIN AFTER THAT LONG DAY OF ANXIETY AND SUSPENSE
OH LAURA DEAREST ONE WORD TO TELL ME THAT I MAY HOPE
MARGARET WILMOT LOOKED UP AT HIM AND A PENSIVE SMILE STOLE OVER HER FACE
JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NO DAUGHTER TO MY KNOWLEDGE
VERY MUCH AS HE HAD DONE AT THE WINCHESTER HOTEL
THIS IS HOW CRIMINALS ESCAPE--THIS IS HOW MURDERERS ARE SUFFERED TO BE AT LARGE
OH YES VERY MAGNIFICENT OF COURSE
HE WORKED STEADILY
AND WHILE BEAUTY APPEALS STRAIGHT TO THE EYE OF THE FRIVOLOUS MERIT REQUIRES TO BE APPRECIATED BY THE WISE
A QUEEN HAD SLEPT IN THE STATE-BED IN THE BLUE-SATIN CHAMBER
BUT I MUST SUIT MY CONVENIENCE TO YOURS
HE HAD WONDERED AS HE GOT NEARER AND NEARER TO WINCHESTER WHAT WOULD BE HIS FIRST IMPRESSION RESPECTING MR DUNBAR
MRS MADDEN UNDERSTOOD THEM PERFECTLY
THE WORK WAS NOT EASY AND IT TOOK THE BANKER A VERY LONG TIME TO COMPLETE IT TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION
AND PHILIP JOCELYN AND HIS WIFE WERE AS HAPPY AS TWO CHILDREN IN THIS PARADISE OF BRICK AND MORTAR
I FANCY THAT IF YOU NEVER ASKED THE SECRET OF MY LIFE YOU CAN GUESS IT PRETTY CLOSELY EH HE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT THE GIRL'S FACE
HE LOOSENED HIS CRAVAT UNFASTENED HIS WAISTCOAT AND FELT FOR THE BEATING OF HIS HEART
LOOK THERE MR AUSTIN HE HANDED ME THE WET DISCOLOURED SHIRT AND POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO ONE PARTICULAR SPOT
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT THE WINDOW NEVERTHELESS IF ONE MIGHT JUDGE BY THE DIFFICULTY WHICH MR DUNBAR HAD IN SETTLING IT TO HIS SATISFACTION
SHE HAD A SUPERB CONTRALTO VOICE RICH DEEP AND MELODIOUS
DO WHAT HE WOULD HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF THE MEMORY OF THE MEETING BETWEEN THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER
AND HALF LOST MY HEART TO LUCY SEDWICKE THE SURGEON'S SISTER
THAT TALK ABOUT THE GOLD-CHAIN HAVING CHANGED HANDS MUST BE UTTERLY ABSURD
I HAVE CALLED AGAIN UPON THE SCOTLAND-YARD PEOPLE AND I GAVE THEM A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THE SCENE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
AND HE HEARD HER SIGH NOW AND THEN AS SHE GAVE HER LESSON
DON'T BE IN A HURRY SIR HE SAID GRAVELY
THAT HORRIBLE SOUND WAS FOLLOWED BY A YELL ALMOST AS HORRIBLE
AN INEXPRESSIBLE FEELING OF MELANCHOLY TOOK POSSESSION OF ME AS I THOUGHT OF THIS
ARTHUR LOVELL TURNED THE HANDLE OF THE STREET DOOR AND WENT IN
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S DIARY VII
THAT SOME BRUTAL WRETCH WHO STAINED HIS SOUL WITH BLOOD FOR THE SAKE OF HIS VICTIM'S POOR POSSESSIONS SHOULD STRIP OFF THE CLOTHES OF THE DEAD AND MAKE A MARKET EVEN OUT OF THEM WAS PROBABLE ENOUGH
BUT HE WAS NOT LIKED
THIS WORLD SEEMS VERY HARD SOMETIMES SO HARD THAT IN A DREADFUL INTERVAL OF DULL DESPAIR THE HEAVENS ARE HIDDEN FROM US AND WE CANNOT RECOGNIZE THE ETERNAL WISDOM GUIDING THE HAND THAT AFFLICTS US
CAN YOU GIVE ME BACK THE DEAD
PACK A SMALL PORTMANTEAU WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S INDISPENSABLE BUT PACK NOTHING UNNECESSARY AM I TO GO WITH YOU SIR THE MAN ASKED
THE MAN LOOKED AT HER WITH CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE
WHEN THIS WAS DONE AND WHEN THE TIMES ADVERTISEMENT HAD BEEN INSERTED FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME WITHOUT ELICITING ANY REPLY I GAVE MYSELF UP TO A KIND OF DESPAIR ABOUT MARGARET
I AM NOT GOING VERY FAR SHE LEFT THE STATION BEFORE THE MAN COULD ASK HER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AND WENT OUT INTO THE MOONLIT COUNTRY ROAD ON WHICH THE STATION ABUTTED
WHEN FIRST WE CAME HERE HIS MIND BROODED UPON THAT AND HE SEEMED TO LOOK UPON WHAT HE HAD DONE AS AN IGNORANT SAVAGE WOULD LOOK UPON THE VENGEANCE WHICH HIS HEATHENISH CREED HAD TAUGHT HIM TO CONSIDER A JUSTIFIABLE ACT OF RETALIATION
AND BETWEEN THE RACES PEOPLE WHO WERE STROLLING UPON THE GROUND CONTRIVED TO APPROACH VERY NEAR THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY SAT WRAPPED IN CASHMERE SHAWLS AND HALF-HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT FUR RUG IN LEGITIMATE INDIAN FASHION
FOR LAURA WAS IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS ON ACCOUNT OF HER FATHER'S RETURN AND DORA MACMAHON JOINED PLEASANTLY IN THE CONVERSATION
HE FOLLOWED HER TO THE GATE AND WATCHED HER DISAPPEAR IN THE TWILIGHT
I HAVE WEIGHED WELL THE STEP I AM ABOUT TO TAKE AND I AM QUITE AWARE THAT I SACRIFICE VERY EXCELLENT PROSPECTS IN THROWING UP MY PRESENT SITUATION
IT'LL PLEASE THEM I KNOW MR DUNBAR FROWNED BUT HE BENT FORWARD FOR A MOMENT AND LEANING HIS HEAD A LITTLE WAY OUT OF THE WINDOW MADE A STATELY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S ENTHUSIASM
HENRY DUNBAR STOOD BEHIND HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIS FACE IN SHADOW
AND THEN IN A CONSTRAINED HALF-MECHANICAL WAY WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXCITED THE WONDER OF ANY ONE LESS SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT THAN HENRY DUNBAR TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES
THE BUSINESS THAT BRINGS ME TO LONDON IS AN ENTIRELY PERSONAL MATTER
SO I CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT LAST TO SIT ALONE BY THE DULL FIRE AND WRITE THIS RECORD OF MY DAY'S WORK WHILE CLEMENT AUSTIN SAT IN THE LONELY SITTING-ROOM AT THE GEORGE INN WITH HIS RAPID PEN SCRATCHING ALONG THE PAPER BEFORE HIM A WOMAN WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LAMP-LIT PLATFORM AT RUGBY WAITING FOR THE BRANCH TRAIN WHICH WAS TO TAKE HER ON TO SHORNCLIFFE
I SHALL START FOR PARIS TO-NIGHT JEFFREYS HE SAID TO THIS MAN
I SAT FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS
THE MEMBER FOR SLOPTON-ON-THE-TEES HE SAID AS HIS SON PLACED A PORTRAIT ON THE EASEL
MR DUNBAR PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND STOOD UPON THE THRESHOLD OF HIS DAUGHTER'S CHAMBER
JOSEPH WILMOT SPRANG INTO A SECOND-CLASS CARRIAGE TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE CORNER WITH HIS HAT SLOUCHED OVER HIS EYES WHICH WERE ALMOST HIDDEN BY ITS DILAPIDATED BRIM
SHE HAD FAILED TO SEE THIS ADVERTISEMENT AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS APPEAL MADE TO HER THROUGH THE SAME MEDIUM AND SHE WOULD NO DOUBT FAIL TO SEE ANY OTHER
FOR YOU'RE AN AMATEUR AT THIS KIND OF WORK AND IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THAT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS YOU MAY GO AND SPOIL MY GAME
AND DURING HIS ABSENCE MARGARET SUFFERED WEARISOME AGONIES OF SUSPENSE
I SHALL TRY AND FIND THE CLOTHES THAT WERE STRIPPED OFF THE MAN WHO WAS MURDERED LAST AUGUST CHAPTER XXXIX
I'M NOT WELL AND I WANT CHANGE OF AIR AND SCENE SO I SHALL START FOR PARIS TO-NIGHT
I WROTE DOWN THE WAITER'S LAST REMARK
ONLY ONE HORRIBLE AND GHASTLY SUGGESTION PRESENTED ITSELF TO ARTHUR LOVELL'S MIND
ONE DAY A NEW IDEA FLASHED INTO CLEMENT AUSTIN'S MIND
THE JUNIOR PARTNER OPENED HIS EYES TO THE WIDEST EXTENT AS THE BRILLIANTS WERE DISPLAYED BEFORE HIM AND DECLARED THAT BIG SENIOR'S GENEROSITY WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN PRINCELY
HADN'T YOU BETTER GIVE THEM A BOW MR DUNBAR HE ADDED IN AN UNDERTONE TO THE BANKER
LET ME BE REASONABLE ABOUT MY DEAR LOVE IF I CAN
FOR A CONNECTION OF HIS OWN HAS APPLIED TO HIM FOR THE APPOINTMENT
WHATEVER DEEPER FEELING LAY BENEATH THE PLAYFUL GAIETY OF HER MANNER HAD YET TO BE AWAKENED
BUT BUSINESS-MEN ARE NECESSARILY AS EXACT IN FIGURES AS CALCULATING-MACHINES
I HAVE SAVED MONEY IF YOU SHOULD BE IN WANT OF HELP WILL YOU LET ME HELP YOU WILLINGLY MR AUSTIN
HE DID SIR ANSWERED THE CLERK WHO HAD DISPLAYED CONSIDERABLE EMOTION IN RELATING THIS STORY OF THE PAST
THE CRIES OF MOTHERS WHOSE CHILDREN HAD BEEN FLUNG OUT OF THEIR ARMS INTO THE VERY JAWS OF DEATH
IT'S A GOLD-MINE HE CRIED RUBBING HIS HANDS
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A CLERK
I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY ON ACCOUNT OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSINESS AT WINCHESTER AND I SHALL MOST RESOLUTELY DEFEND MYSELF FROM ANY FURTHER PERSECUTION
THE NOTE WAS NOT A LONG ONE NOR WAS IT ENCUMBERED BY ANY CEREMONIOUS PHRASEOLOGY
BUT I WAS BLINDED THEN BY PRIDE AND ANGER
HE HAD PROMISED TO COME BACK TO HER BY TEN O'CLOCK UPON THE EVENING OF THE 16TH
IS SHE LIKE HER FATHER NO SIR
I UNDERSTOOD THE HINT AND ACCORDINGLY TOOK MY TRAVELLING-DESK TO A SIDE-TABLE NEAR THE FIREPLACE
OR SITTIN IN THE COFFEE-ROOM OF THE HOTEL YONDER WATCHIN AND LISTENIN FOR THE NEXT TRAIN TILL BEIN THERE TO KEEP AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR MASTER IS THE HOLLEREST OF MOCKERIES MR CARTER TOOK HIS IRATE SUBORDINATE TO THE COFFEE-ROOM OF THE STATION HOTEL WHERE MR TIBBLES HAD ENGAGED A BED AND TAKEN A FEW HOURS SLEEP IN THE DEAD INTERVAL BETWEEN THE STARTING OF THE LAST TRAIN AT NIGHT AND THE FIRST IN THE MORNING
AND THEY INSTITUTED A GENTLEMANLY SCHOOL SIR
NOT THAT ANYBODY WOULD TRY TO THWART ME YOU UNDERSTAND IF THEY KNEW THAT I WAS DETECTIVE OFFICER HENRY CARTER OF SCOTLAND YARD
HE HANDED THIS DOCUMENT UP TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE CROW AND THAT GENTLEMAN WHO WAS BY NO MEANS AN ADEPT IN THE UNSEAMANLIKE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF READING AND WRITING TURNED IT OVER AND EXAMINED IT THOUGHTFULLY IN THE VIVID MOONLIGHT
I AM SORRY TO DETAIN YOU SIR HE SAID
I SHALL GO TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY TO-MORROW HENRY DUNBAR SAID
IF YOU WANT TO QUARREL WITH ANYTHING QUARREL WITH THE DOCTRINE OF CHANCES NOT WITH ME HENRY DUNBAR TURNED AWAY WITH A SULKY GESTURE
YES MR LOVELL THOUGHT AGAIN AS HE WATCHED THE RICH MAN'S FACE HIS NERVES MUST BE MADE OF IRON CHAPTER XII
BUT SUCH A BLESSING AS LAURA DUNBAR'S LOVE IS NOT FOR ME
NOT BECAUSE DISCOVERY IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE EFFECTED BY A SLOW AND WEARISOME PROCESS IN WHICH SO FEW MEN HAVE COURAGE TO PERSEVERE
THE LOW BROODING SKY THE DARK AND MURKY ATMOSPHERE AND THAT MONOTONOUS RAIN WOULD HAVE GONE FAR TO DEPRESS THE SPIRITS OF THE GAYEST REVELLER IN ALL THE UNIVERSE
ON THE CONTRARY THE GARB HE ASSUMED WAS IN PERFECT KEEPING WITH THE STYLE OF HIS HAIR AND MOUSTACHE
THE MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF HENRY DUNBAR WAS LYING ON THE TAPESTRIED CUSHIONS OF A CARVED OAKEN COUCH THAT STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE IN HIS SPACIOUS SITTING-ROOM
HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON THE BED AND FELL INTO A HEAVY SLUMBER
AND IF--IF YOU WILL ACCEPT ANY REWARD FOR YOUR EFFORTS I SHALL BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO GIVE ALL YOU CAN ASK
BUT NOT TOWARDS THE CHURCH
OH FATHER SHE EXCLAIMED LIFTING HER HANDS TO HER HEAD AND PUSHING THE LOOSE TANGLED HAIR AWAY FROM HER FACE
MY DEAR LOVE--DO I DARE TO CALL HER THAT ALREADY WHEN FOR ANYTHING I KNOW TO THE CONTRARY THERE MAY BE ANOTHER EVANGELICAL CURATE IN THE BACKGROUND
WHERE THE FEATHERY FERNS TREMBLED WITH EVERY LOW WHISPER OF THE AUTUMN BREEZE
NO MOTHER
THE PAINTER SHRUGGED UP HIS SHOULDERS AND PURSED UP HIS MOUTH THOUGHTFULLY
I HAD ASKED THAT SORDID QUESTION ONLY TO HIDE THE UNREASONING GLADNESS OF MY HEART
MR CARTER THE DETECTIVE LOST NO TIME ABOUT HIS WORK
CARRY YOUR MIND FARTHER BACK
OH CLEMENT SHE SAID DO YOU FORGET WHO I AM
HE LOOKED AT THE REPROBATE'S FACE FOR SOME MOMENTS AND SAID NOTHING
AND HIS TENDER REGARD HIS RESPECTFUL DEVOTION WERE VERY NEW AND SWEET TO THE LONELY GIRL
BUT HE REFUSED TO DO SO
WHY SHE IS GENTLENESS ITSELF VERY LIKELY
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AFTER EXAMINING HIS PATIENT
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING DREAMY NOT TO SAY PENSIVE IN THE ATTITUDE OF HER DROOPING HEAD
IT WAS A LITTLE AFTER NINE O'CLOCK WHEN HE ENTERED THE DOCKS AND THE ELECTRA WAS VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE STEAMING THROUGH THE BLUE WATER UNDER A CLOUDLESS SUMMER SKY
FOR HE HAD BELIEVED AS FIRMLY IN MARGARET WILMOT'S TRUTH AS HE HAD BELIEVED IN THE BLUE SKY ABOVE HIS HEAD
GONE AS NEAT AS EVER A MAN WENT YET HE RAN BACK TO THE FLY AND DROVE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MR HOGSON GROCER AND GENERAL DEALER--THE SHOP OF THE VILLAGE OF LISFORD
ON SUCH OCCASIONS THE BARONET USED TO TIE HIS HORSE TO THE LOWER BRANCH OF AN OLD ELM AND TAKING HIS STAND BEHIND MISS DUNBAR WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HER A LESSON IN PERSPECTIVE WITH OCCASIONAL HINTS TO MISS MACMAHON WHO AS THE YOUNG MAN REMARKED DREW SO MUCH BETTER THAN HER SISTER THAT SHE REALLY REQUIRED VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE
AND THEN BRIGMAWL THE HEAD-WAITER HE GIVE HIS EVIDENCE
FOR AN INTERVAL THAT SEEMED A LONG ONE ALL WAS UNCERTAINTY
YOU'RE A STUPENDOUS FELLOW DEAR BOY
BUT IT IS NOT SO PLEASANT TO COME HOME AND HEAR THAT ALICE IS DEAD AND BURIED
HE USHERED MARGARET INTO A PRIVATE SITTING-ROOM LEADING OUT OF THE HALL AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
I WANT YOU TO GO TO HER MOTHER
AND IT WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO SEE MR CARTER LOLLING IN HIS ARM-CHAIR WITH WHAT HE CALLED THE WINE-CART IN HIS HAND DELIBERATING BETWEEN A FORTY-TWO PORT LIGHT AND ELEGANT AND A FORTY-FIVE PORT TAWNY AND RICH BOUQUET I THINK WE MAY AS WELL TRY NUMBER FIFTEEN HE SAID HANDING THE LIST OF WINES TO THE WAITER AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION
SO THE ONLY TIME SHE CAN POSSIBLY GIVE LIZZIE IS EITHER VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING OR RATHER LATE IN THE EVENING
IT MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AT HENRY DUNBAR'S DICTATION AND UNDER COERCION
THE TENDER INTEREST WHICH I THEN FELT IN YOU WAS THE FIRST MYSTERIOUS DAWN OF LOVE THOUGH I IN MY INFINITE WISDOM PUT IT DOWN TO AN ARTISTIC ADMIRATION FOR YOUR PECULIAR BEAUTY
AND A VERY CLEVER YOUNG LAWYER HE IS I'VE BEEN TOLD SO MUCH THE BETTER ANSWERED CLEMENT FOR I WANT TO CONSULT HIM UPON A LITTLE MATTER OF BUSINESS
IT WAS A STREET IN WHICH PARISIAN DRIVERS CLACKED THEIR WHIPS TO A RUNNING ACCOMPANIMENT OF IMPRECATIONS
AND YET IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL
I KNEW THE STRENGTH OF MY NOBLE GIRL'S LOVE FOR HER REPROBATE FATHER
AND THEN WE SIT TALKING IN THE TENDER SUMMER DUSK OR IN THE SUBDUED LIGHT OF A SHADED LAMP ON THE PIANO
THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN PROUD OF HER FATHER REPROBATE THOUGH HE WAS
IT WAS THE ONLY UNSELFISH ACT OF HIS LIFE THIS PARTING WITH HIS CHILD
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MR CARTER WAS ABLE TO ENTER INTO CLEMENT'S VIEWS AND SEQUESTRATE HIMSELF FOR A SHORT PERIOD FOR THE MORE DELIBERATE INVESTIGATION OF THE WINCHESTER BUSINESS
YOU'RE DRESSED ALL BUT YOUR BONNET
THE FRIEND WAS A MIDDLE-AGED AND MOST RESPECTABLE-LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH A TURNIP-HUED SKIN RELIEVED BY FRECKLES DARK-RED EYES AND PALE-RED HAIR
I RAN IN AMONGST THE TREES
STOPPED UPON THE WAY XXXI
A GOOD MANY YOUNG LADIES WERE EXPRESSLY IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND BY ANXIOUS PAPAS AND MAMMAS WITH A VIEW TO THE CAPTURE OF THE WEALTHY WIDOWER
IT WAS HALF-PAST TWO
THE GOOD MOTHER HAD MADE THIS SACRIFICE WILLINGLY AND WITHOUT COMPLAINT AS SHE WOULD HAVE MADE ANY OTHER SACRIFICE FOR HER DEARLY-BELOVED ONLY SON
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
YOU'D BETTER MAKE YOURSELF SCARCE HE SAID
I'VE HAD IT READY FOR YOU EVER SO LONG
HE WAS AN OFFICER IN THE EAST-INDIA COMPANY'S SERVICE
THE LUGGAGE HAS BEEN SENT OFF JOSEPH WILMOT HAD NOT YET REMOVED HIS HAT
HE HAD PLANNED HIS FLIGHT AND HAD STARTED ON THAT WINTRY AFTERNOON WHEN THE SABBATH BELLS HAD A MUFFLED SOUND AS THEIR SOLEMN PEALS FLOATED ACROSS THE SNOW--HE HAD STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY WITH THE INTENTION OF NEVER AGAIN RETURNING TO MAUDESLEY ABBEY
AND WHY WHEN SHE HAD ONCE SEEN THAT MAN SHE TRIED TO SHIELD HIM FROM INQUIRY AND PURSUIT
YOU SEE LADY JOCELYN IS AFRAID THE LONG ILLNESS AND FEVER AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING MAY HAVE HAD A VERY BAD EFFECT UPON HER POOR FATHER AND THAT HE'S A LITTLE BIT TOUCHED IN THE UPPER STORY PERHAPS;--AND UPON MY WORD ADDED THE DETECTIVE FRANKLY I THINK THIS SUDDEN BOLT LOOKS VERY LIKE IT
IF HENRY DUNBAR THE RICH BANKER HAD BEEN MURDERED THE POLICE WOULD NEVER HAVE RESTED UNTIL THE ASSASSIN HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
BUT UNTIL TO-NIGHT HE HAD ALWAYS COME UNDER HIS MOTHER'S WING TO SEE THE PRETTY MUSIC-MISTRESS
CHAPTER XVIII
BUT EVERY EVENING WHEN IT'S TOLERABLY FINE SHE GOES TO THE CHURCHYARD
HE WENT DOWN TO THE QUAY AND ASCERTAINED THAT NO BOAT HAD CROSSED TO THE LINCOLNSHIRE SIDE OF THE RIVER WITHIN THE LAST HOUR
BUT THEN IF THE CLIMATE SHOULD KILL HER
BUT THEN HE NEED TO EXCUSE HIMSELF TO ME ON ACCOUNT OF THE HURRY OF BUSINESS
BUT IN ALL THIS NEW COMFORT MARGARET WILMOT HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HENRY DUNBAR
HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT THROB LIKE A PRISONER WHO LEAPS AWAY FROM THE FETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN NEWLY LOOSENED
IT WAS SUCH A FACE AS COULD ONLY BELONG TO SOME HIGH FAVOURITE OF FORTUNE DEFIANT OF ALL MANKIND IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN SUPREME ADVANTAGES
HE SAT BREATHING HARD AND QUICK AND STARING AT MR DUNBAR
MINE WAS AWAKENED LAST NIGHT AND I RESOLVED TO SPARE YOU THE MISERY OF BEING MARRIED TO A WOMAN WHO COMES OF SUCH A RACE AS THAT FROM WHICH I SPRING NOTHING COULD BE MORE CALLOUS THAN THE MANNER WITH WHICH MARGARET WILMOT HAD MADE THIS SPEECH
SHE SAW THE BEDROOM WITH THE TALL GLOOMY BEDSTEAD THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE FLICKERING HERE AND THERE
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT LOVE ME BECAUSE I WILL NEVER CAUSE YOU TO BLUSH FOR THE HISTORY OF YOUR WIFE'S GIRLHOOD THAT IS NO ANSWER TO MY QUESTION MARGARET SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN SEATING HIMSELF BY HER SIDE AND TAKING BOTH HER HANDS IN HIS
BUT HE BROKE OUT VIOLENTLY IN THE NEXT INSTANT
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN SUPPLY YOU WITH FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF SUCH DIAMONDS AS YOU MAY REQUIRE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HE SAID
THIS MAN'S NAME WAS SAMPSON WILMOT
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MARGARET WENTWORTH'S FACE SOME SHADE OF EXPRESSION VAGUE AND TRANSITORY IN ITS NATURE THAT BORE A LIKENESS TO HER FATHER
HE HAD QUITE CONQUERED THAT FIERCENESS OF EXPRESSION BY THIS TIME AND SPOKE VERY QUIETLY
AY SIR VERY YOUNG TO BE RUINED FOR LIFE
AND IF HE IS UNKIND TO ME--IF HE DOES NOT LOVE ME SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
THE YOUNG MAN IDOLIZED LAURA
IT'S VERY SELDOM AS I GET GOLD FOR MY TROUBLE SIR
AND LAURA FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE WET WEATHER AS SHE LAID HER LIGHT HAND ON PHILIP JOCELYN'S ARM
MARGARET COULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE PARK THEREFORE BY THE PRINCIPAL ENTRANCE
MR DUNBAR'S CARD-CASE HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE BREAST-POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT AND A GREAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WAITING-ROOM KNEW THAT THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE WHITE LACE AND GREY MOUSTACHE LYING SO QUIETLY UPON ONE OF THE BROAD SOFAS WAS NO LESS A PERSONAGE THAN HENRY DUNBAR OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND ST GUNDOLPH LANE
I COULD SEE THAT HIS SPIRITS HAD RISEN A GREAT MANY DEGREES SINCE THE READING OF THE LETTER
HOW COULD I THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY MAN COULD BE AS CRUELLY DECEIVED AS I HAVE BEEN BY THIS WOMAN I MAY GO NOW MR AUSTIN SAID MARGARET
SHE WAS NOT EXPECTED TO ARRIVE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY AT THE EARLIEST
WHY SHE PLAYS MAGNIFICENTLY CLEMENT
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AMBITIOUS AND THAT SHORNCLIFFE WAS TOO NARROW A SPHERE FOR YOUR AMBITION OR ELSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERTAINED ANY IDEA OF THIS INDIAN APPOINTMENT AND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY IF I REMAIN IN ENGLAND SORRY
DON'T DETAIN ME OR FOLLOW ME SHE PASSED BY HIM AND HURRIED OUT OF THE HOUSE
IT SEEMED THAT THE MURDERER HAD STRIPPED HIS VICTIM FOR THE SAKE OF THE CLOTHES WHICH HE HAD WORN
SHE HAD NO MOTHER AND SHE HAD NOT EVEN THE MEMORY OF HER MOTHER WHO HAD DIED SEVENTEEN YEARS BEFORE LEAVING AN ONLY CHILD OF TWELVE MONTHS OLD FOR JAMES WENTWORTH TO KEEP
HE HAD ALL THE POINTS WHICH AN ARAB PRIZES IN HIS FAVOURITE BARB
THE JURYMEN TALKED A LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER IN SCARCELY AUDIBLE WHISPERS ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS OF THE SURGEON AND THEN WALKED SOFTLY FROM THE DARKENED ROOM
AND HAD BEEN DONE WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS
A PRETTY GAME YOU'VE PLAYED ME HE SAID IN AN INJURED TONE
ON THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS RESOLUTION TOOK A DEFINITE FORM CLEMENT RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MARGARET WILMOT
THE PEOPLE MEAN WELL I DARE SAY
LAURA DUNBAR LAID HER HAND CARESSINGLY UPON THE BANKER'S SHOULDER AS SHE SPOKE
THE DIM MORNING LIGHT WAS GREY IN THE SKY BEFORE SHE MET ANY ONE WHOM SHE COULD ASK TO DIRECT HER TO WOODBINE COTTAGE
BUT THEY ONLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS GRAVELY AND DISMISSED HIM WITH THEIR THANKS FOR HIS INFORMATION
HE HAD BEEN SENT TO INDIA BECAUSE OF A GREAT ERROR WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED IN HIS EARLY YOUTH
THE MAJOR WAS USHERED AT ONCE TO THE TAPESTRIED ROOM WHERE THE BANKER WAS STILL SITTING AT THE DINNER-TABLE
IT WAS NEW TO HER TO SIT QUIETLY LOOKING OUT AT THE LOW MEADOWS AND GLIMMERING WHITE-WALLED VILLAS THE PATCHES OF SPARSE WOODLAND THE DISTANT VILLAGES THE GLIMPSES OF RIPPLING WATER SHINING IN THE WINTRY SUN
BUT HENRY DUNBAR WAS NOT A CLOSE OBSERVER
THE SHARP EYES OF THE MATRON HAD FATHOMED THE YOUNG MAN'S SENTIMENTS LONG BEFORE LAURA DUNBAR DARED TO WHISPER TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS BELOVED
HE MADE A BOLD ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE ACT AND REMOVED TO NORFOLK ISLAND
THAT MEMORY WOULD PASS AWAY THEN AS OTHER MEMORIES HAVE PASSED
MARGARET HAD WAITED VERY PATIENTLY FOR THIS TIME IN WHICH CLEMENT WOULD BE FREE TO GIVE HER ALL HIS HELP IN THAT AWFUL TASK WHICH LAY BEFORE HER--THE DISCOVERY OF HENRY DUNBAR'S GUILT
A PRETTY THING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF YOUR PA HAD COME ALL THE WAY FROM INDIA TO FIND HIS ONLY DAUGHTER GALLIVANTING AT A THEAYTRE MISS DUNBAR LOOKED AT HER OLD NURSE WITH AN ARCH SMILE
THEY WERE ABSENT ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THEN RETURNED A VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST SOME PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN
WHAT IF HE SHOULD GIVE ME THE SLIP
YES ACCORDING TO THE COMMON ACCEPTATION OF THE TERM SHE HAD BEEN SPOILED
I HOPE YOUR SHAWL IS THICK FOR THE DEWS ARE FALLING AND HERE NEAR THE RIVER THERE IS A DAMP MIST ON THESE AUTUMN NIGHTS THE SPEAKER WAS CLEMENT AUSTIN
THE BANKER ASSENTED WILLINGLY ENOUGH TO THE PROPOSITION
EVERYTHING THAT UNLIMITED WEALTH CAN DO TO MAKE A HOUSE BEAUTIFUL HAD BEEN DONE FOR THIS PART OF THE MANSION BY PERCIVAL DUNBAR
THE DETECTIVE ASKED TO SEE MAJOR VERNON AND THE YOUNG WOMAN USHERED HIM INTO A LITTLE PARLOUR AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE WITHOUT EITHER DELAY OR HESITATION
FOR HER NATURE WAS AS JOYOUS AS THAT OF A BIRD WHOSE MUSIC FILLS ALL THE WIDE HEAVEN WITH ONE REJOICING PSALM
NOBLE STAIRCASES WITH BROAD SLIPPERY OAKEN BANISTERS AND SHALLOW STEPS
HAVEN'T I DONE ENOUGH FOR YOU
I WAS FRIGHTENED OF HIM PHILIP
THAT IS NOT MY FATHER'S PORTRAIT NO SAID PHILIP JOCELYN THAT WAS NEVER THE LIKENESS OF HENRY DUNBAR MR FREDERICK KERSTALL SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SIR CRIED MR VERNON'S HOUSEMAID
SHE TRIES TO SOFTEN ME WITH THESE THINGS SOMETIMES--AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE STORY SAID IT WAS WELL FOR THE MOST MISERABLE OF US TO PRAY LORD KEEP MY MEMORY GREEN BUT WHAT IF THE MEMORY IS A RECORD OF CRIME MR DUNBAR
WE WALKED TOGETHER ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE UNDER THE TREES AND I HAD INTENDED TO GO ON TO THE FERNS TO CALL UPON MICHAEL MARSTON'S WIDOW
THREE HOURS AND A HALF FROM LONDON WITH DUE ALLOWANCE FOR DELAYS IN CHANGING CARRIAGES
I HAVE NO FEAR OF HER
WHAT HAPPENED AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY
SIR PHILIP ASKED THIS GENTLEMAN IF HE KNEW THE NAME OF THE ARTIST WHO HAD PAINTED THE PEASANT-GIRL
A MOST MYSTERIOUS EVENT
JOSEPH TOOK THESE THINGS INTO THE SITTING-ROOM CLOSED THE DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO APARTMENTS AND THEN RANG FOR LIGHTS
IF I SHOULD LOSE HER AS I LOST HER MOTHER
AND I SAT QUIET NOT MORE THAN THREE MINUTES AT MOST BECOS YOU SEE I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE FOLLERIN HIM
HIS ATTENDANTS WERE ABLE TO REMOVE HIM FROM ONE CHAMBER TO ANOTHER
THERE WERE DAYS UPON WHICH DIVERS SPECIES OF FISH WERE TO BE HAD IN SHORNCLIFFE BUT THE SOJOURNER AT THE REINDEER RARELY HAPPENED TO HIT UPON ONE OF THOSE DAYS
THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE HE REPLIED
OH IF YOU WOULD ONLY GIVE IT UP FOR MY SAKE MY DARLING MY PET IS THERE ANYTHING I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I COULD DO IN HONOUR
I ONLY ARRIVED THIS MORNING
FOR THE KIND-HEARTED WIDOW GREW EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE ATTACHED TO MARGARET WILMOT
IT WOULD BE TOO BITTER
SHE WORE SHABBY DRESSES AND WAS RARELY KNOWN TO HAVE A NEW BONNET
YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD GIRL MARGARET--A NOBLE GIRL
IN SPITE OF THE MISERABLE WEATHER IN DEFIANCE OF MR DUNBAR'S DESIRE THAT THE WEDDING SHOULD BE A QUIET ONE PEOPLE HAD COME FROM A VERY LONG DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEE THE MILLIONAIRE'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER MARRIED TO THE MASTER OF JOCELYN'S ROCK
BUT WAS HIS LOVE HOPELESS IN THE FUTURE
IF I'M WRONG I'LL KEEP MY THOUGHTS TO MYSELF
AT HALF-AFTER ONE HE GOT INTO THE FLY AND ORDERED THE MAN TO GO BACK TO SHORNCLIFFE STATION
OR CONJURED UP BY SOME CHANCE ALLUSION DROPPED FROM THE LIPS OF STRANGERS SOME COINCIDENCE OF RESEMBLANCE IN A SCENE OR FACE OR TONE OR LOOK
IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN PAPA DEAR SHE SAID IN TONES THAT WERE ONLY LOUD ENOUGH FOR MR DUNBAR TO HEAR
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU
SHE RAN AWAY FROM HER HOME ONE MORNING WAS MARRIED BY STEALTH IN AN OBSCURE LITTLE CHURCH IN THE CITY AND THEN WENT HOME WITH MY FATHER TO CONFESS WHAT SHE HAD DONE
I SWORE TO REMEMBER THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR SHE SAID IN A LOW SOMBRE VOICE
AND I UNDERSTAND FROM HER LETTERS THAT SHE WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE ME
RATHER WET ECHOED LAURA WITH AN AIR OF VEXATION
HE ONLY HEARD THOSE GUTTURAL AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH RAILWAY OFFICIALS ROAR OUT UPON THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT TO THE BEWILDERMENT OF HELPLESS TRAVELLERS
IF HE WAS CALLED UPON TO WORM-OUT CHANCE CLUES TO GUILTY SECRETS IN THE CARELESS CONFIDENCE THAT GROWS OUT OF A FRIENDLY GLASS
THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE GLIMMER OF LIGHT IN THE STREET AS THE MAJOR WALKED ALONG IT
THE DULL STONY LOOK OF HER FACE FILLED CLEMENT'S MIND WITH AN AWFUL TERROR
WELL SAID MR CARTER THERE ISN'T MUCH HERE IS THERE
HE HAD CALLED IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE AND ASKED MR BALDERBY TO GO WITH HIM TO INSPECT THE DIAMONDS HE HAD BOUGHT FOR HIS DAUGHTER
MY SERVANT OUGHT TO BE HERE BY THIS TIME SO HE OUGHT SIR SAID THE VERGER WHO WAS READY TO AGREE TO ANYTHING MR DUNBAR MIGHT SAY
THE BARONET'S FACE WHICH WAS ALWAYS A HANDSOME ONE LOOKED SPLENDID IN THE LIGHT OF HIS HAPPINESS
HEAVEN KNOWS I NEVER WISHED YOU ILL
THE MAN LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT HER
THE VERGER WHO HAD SEEN AND SPOKEN TO THE TWO MEN AND WHO HAD AFTERWARDS SHOWN THE CATHEDRAL TO MR DUNBAR
HIS VOICE HAD GROWN THICK AND HUSKY
THEN AFTER ORDERING DINNER FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU KEEP IT WAITING NEARLY TWO HOURS
WHAT CLOTHES DID MR DUNBAR WEAR WHEN HE WENT AWAY GREY TROUSERS AND WAISTCOAT SMALL SHEPHERD'S PLAID AND HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A GREATCOAT LINED WITH RUSSIAN SABLE A BLACK COAT NO
WHILE THE MAN FOR WHOM I HAD DONE WRONG--THE MAN WHO HAD MADE ME HIS TOOL--TURNED HIS BACK UPON ME AND REFUSED TO UTTER ONE WORD IN MY JUSTIFICATION THOUGH HE WAS IN NO DANGER HIMSELF AND THE LIGHTEST WORD FROM HIS LIPS MIGHT HAVE SAVED ME
NO FATHER DEAR SHE SAID
THE GREATEST WRONG YOU CAN INFLICT UPON ME WILL BE INFLICTED BY YOUR DESERTION
AND IF YOU DON'T HOLD YOUR TONGUE I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR IT HO HO THOUGHT THE DETECTIVE
BUT HE UTTERED NO EXCLAMATION OF HORROR OR SURPRISE
SO FAR AS THE MAN'S HEAD AND FACE WENT THE TRANSFORMATION WAS PERFECT
WELL SAWNEY IT'S A BAD JOB CERTAINLY
BUT THERE IS NO TIME TO SPEAK OF THAT NOW
MARGARET POINTED TO ONE PASSAGE ON THE SECOND PAGE
AND THEN WAS FAIN TO GO ACROSS TO LINCOLNSHIRE ONCE MORE AND WATCH THE DEPARTURE OF THE TRAIN
SUBDUED IN VOICE EASY AND RATHER LISTLESS IN GAIT HAUGHTY AND SELF-POSSESSED IN TONE
THE CONSTABULARY HAD ALREADY BEEN BUSY
WE WENT DOWN THE SLIPPERY OAK-STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE QUIET STREET
BUT HE LEANED HEAVILY UPON THE BRONZE SCROLL-WORK OF THE BANISTER AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP FIERCELY WITH HIS STRONG WHITE TEETH
HE WAS NOT A GREAT PAINTER NOR INDEED WAS THERE ANY ELEMENT OF GREATNESS IN HIS NATURE
BUT IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING AGAINST MR DUNBAR WHY OF COURSE THAT ALTERS THE CASE
BUT HE WAS NOT GOING TO WRITE
YES YES I WILL BRAVE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD DO ANYTHING TO SAVE YOU FROM SHE SHUDDERED AS SHE REMEMBERED WHAT THE DANGER WAS THAT ASSAILED HIM THE HORROR FROM WHICH FLIGHT ALONE COULD SAVE HIM
AND FROM THE TIME OF THOSE FESTIVITIES AT MAUDESLEY ABBEY HE ONLY DREAMED AND THOUGHT OF LAURA DUNBAR
THE GIRL FOLDED THE PAPER AND PUT IT IN HER BREAST
YOU ARE MINE BY RIGHT OF YOUR OWN MOST SACRED PROMISE MARGARET
BUT MY ADVERTISEMENT REMAINED UNANSWERED--NO LETTER CAME FROM MARGARET
AS IF HE FANCIED THERE MIGHT BE SOME SCRAP OF INFORMATION TO BE PICKED UP FROM A WINDOW-BLIND OR A COAL-SCUTTLE OR LURKING MYSTERIES HIDDEN IN A SIDEBOARD-DRAWER
BUT SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER ARE AUTUMNAL MONTHS
BECAUSE IF I DID I SHOULD BETRAY MY INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS AND SPOIL MY GAME
HE CAME BACK AGAIN IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES LOOKING ALMOST AS PALE AS MR DUNBAR
THE LANDLORD OF THE GEORGE AND THE WAITER WHO HAD RECEIVED THE TRAVELLERS AND HAD TAKEN MR DUNBAR'S ORDERS FOR THE DINNER
AT LAST WHEN I WAS COMPLETELY WORN OUT BY MY WEARY DAY MR CARTER CAME TO ME
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY BROTHER JOSEPH EVER DID A DISHONEST ACTION IN HIS LIFE UNTIL HE FORGED THOSE BILLS
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD VISITED THE HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE SINCE HIS RETURN FROM INDIA
THE SOUL WAS GONE ALREADY
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND IT MIGHTN'T
BUT I HAD NOT FINISHED MY WORK YET
IF YOU THINK TO MAKE A FOOL OF ME BY ANY MAUDLIN SENTIMENTALITY YOU MAKE A STILL GREATER MISTAKE
I AM ONLY A WORKING MAN CONTENT TO ACCEPT A SALARY FOR MY SERVICES
THE NURSE STILL SAT BY THE HEAD OF THE BED
THERE HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEPTH OF SNOW YES
YOU NEEDN'T LEAVE US SAMPSON SAID MR HUGH WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIS BROTHER AT THE WRITING-TABLE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MIGHT IT NOT BE POSSIBLE THAT THE BANKER WISHED TO GET RID OF HIS DAUGHTER
THE MAJOR PULLED THE POODLE COLLAR STILL HIGHER ABOVE HIS EARS AND WENT OUT WITH ONLY HIS NOSE EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
SAMPSON WILMOT SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM RESTLESS AND UNEASY WATCHING HIS FIERCE GLOOMY COUNTENANCE
AND THE BREAST BENEATH IT ACHED WITH A SICK COLD PAIN THAT WAS LIKE THE PAIN OF DEATH
THREE OR FOUR MILITARY-LOOKING MEN DRESSED IN LOOSE GARMENTS OF GREY AND NANKEEN COLOUR
HE PEERED INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER GOING FROM MONUMENT TO MONUMENT WITH THE PATIENT TALKATIVE OLD VERGER AT HIS HEELS
THE SUNLIT SUBURBAN ROADS WERE ENCHANTED GLADES
BUT I AM SURE OF IT MARGARET ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD
HER FATHER HAD YIELDED TO HER ENTREATIES WITH A VERY TOLERABLE GRACE AND HE WAS HERE
MASTER DIDN'T SAY NOTHING SIR SHE SAID
SHE WAS A PETTED HEIRESS REMEMBER AND THE WORLD HAD GONE SO SMOOTHLY WITH HER HITHERTO THAT PERHAPS SHE SCARCELY ENDURED CALAMITY OR CONTRADICTION WITH SO GOOD A GRACE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD SHE BEEN A LITTLE NEARER PERFECTION
THIS ROOM WAS A SORT OF SNUGGERY HALF LIBRARY HALF BREAKFAST-PARLOUR AND IT WAS IN THIS ROOM MY MOTHER AND I HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE DIAMONDS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ME
SHE LISTENED TO HIM WHEN HE TALKED TO HER OF THE BOOKS OR THE MUSIC SHE LOVED
AT LAST THERE WAS A SHOUT AND A HEAD APPEARED ABOVE THE WATER ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARDS THE VESSEL
AND EVERY TIME WE CHANGES CARRIAGES WHICH WE DON'T SEEM TO DO MUCH ELSE THE WHOLE TIME I SPOTS MY GENTLEMAN LIMPIN AWFUL AND LOOKIN ABOUT HIM SUSPICIOUS-LIKE TO SEE IF HE WAS WATCHED
I DOUBT BUT WE SHALL HAVE A CHANGE COME DARK HE WAS LOOKING OUT TO WINDWARD AS HE SPOKE
SHE HAD NOT CEASED TO BELIEVE HIM GUILTY OF HER FATHER'S MURDER
AS I PRAYED IN THIS ROOM BEFORE--AS I HAVE PRAYED EVERY HOUR SINCE THAT DREADFUL TIME--I PRAY AGAIN TO-NIGHT
CLEMENT WENT THROUGH THE USUAL FICTION OF DELIBERATION AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE FOR DINNER AND OF COURSE ENDED WITH THE PERENNIAL CHICKEN AND CUTLETS
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO HELP IN HUNTING HIM TO THE GALLOWS MR CARTER LOOKED VERY GRAVE
THE DOG WENT WITH HIS YOUNG MISTRESS SUBMISSIVELY ENOUGH
AND LOOKING FORWARD BY-AND-BY TO A JUNIOR PARTNERSHIP IN THE HOUSE I SERVE
THERE WAS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY THEREFORE IN HIS ABSENCE
THE FACE OF THE CINQ MARS ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF HIS GIDDY EMINENCE WITH A HUNDRED PAIRS OF BOOTS IN HIS DRESSING-ROOM AND QUIET CARDINAL RICHELIEU WATCHING SILENTLY FOR THE DAY OF HIS DOOM
WHEN THE TABLE HAD BEEN CLEARED AND THE TWO MEN LEFT ALONE TOGETHER MAJOR VERNON STRETCHED HIS LONG LEGS UPON THE HEARTH-RUG PLUNGED HIS HANDS DEEP DOWN IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS AND GAVE A SIGH OF SATISFACTION
THE SECOND TURNING ON MY RIGHT TOOK ME INTO A KIND OF LANE OR BY-ROAD WHERE THERE WERE SOME OLD-FASHIONED SEMI-DETACHED COTTAGES SHELTERED BY A ROW OF SYCAMORES AND SHUT IN BY WOODEN PALINGS
IF THEY SHOULD BE TRAVELLING BY THIS TRAIN
CAN YOU SUPPLY ME WITH WHAT I WANT HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
IN SPITE OF OURSELVES WE ARE THE SLAVES OF ATMOSPHERIC INFLUENCES
AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST AS WELL TURN MY EVENING WALK TO SOME ACCOUNT BY CALLING UPON THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE CARD
THE BANKER RETURNED HIS LOOK AS UNFLINCHINGLY AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE AND SPOKE IN A HARD UNFALTERING VOICE AS HE ANSWERED
THE HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS BREAST AFTER THE SCENE OF THE MORNING WEIGHED UPON HIM LIKE THE BURDEN THAT SEEMS TO LIE UPON THE SLEEPER'S BREAST THROUGHOUT THE STRANGE AGONY OF NIGHTMARE
COULD IT BE REALLY POSSIBLE THAT IN THIS SHEET OF PAPER I HAD FOUND A CLUE WHICH WOULD HELP ME TO TRACE MY LOST LOVE
THE MAJOR WENT BACK TO THE ROSE AND CROWN ATE A COMFORTABLE LITTLE DINNER WHICH HE HAD ORDERED BEFORE SETTING OUT FOR SHORNCLIFFE PAID HIS BILL AND MADE ALL ARRANGEMENTS FOR STARTING BY THE FIRST TRAIN FOR LONDON ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
MAKE IT TWO FIVE THIS TIME AND YOUR PETITIONER WILL EVER PRAY C
THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY OBJECT OF VALUE IN THE MANSION THAT HAD NOT A SPECIAL HISTORY ATTACHED TO IT REDOUNDING TO THE HONOUR AND GLORY OF THE ANCIENT HOUSE OF JOCELYN
AND THE MEANEST NATURES KINDLED WITH A FAINT GLOW OF POETRY WHEN THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH HER
LET ME IN
AH GO IT DO WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT HE EXCLAIMED BITTERLY WHEN THE RAILWAY OFFICIAL HAD GIVEN HIM THIS PLEASING INTELLIGENCE
A RECKLESS DARE-DEVIL SCOUNDREL AT WAR WITH SOCIETY AND DEFIANT OF A WORLD HE HATED
YOU CAN BE OF VERY GREAT SERVICE TO ME IF YOU CAN FIND MY FRIEND
BUT HE WAS SLOW TO DO THIS
SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO BE SURROUNDED BY ALL THAT IS REFINED AND BEAUTIFUL
MARGARET CAN LOVE ME VERY LITTLE IN THAT CASE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
I HAD GIVEN HIM MONEY FOR ANY EXPENSES SUCH AS THESE
IF I FIND THAT SHE IS I SHALL SLEEP IN WINCHESTER TO-NIGHT AND DRIVE OVER TO-MORROW MORNING TO SEE HER
MR CARTER CARRIED THE BUNDLE OF CLOTHES TO HIS OWN ROOM AND RETURNED BY-AND-BY BRINGING HIS PORTMANTEAU WITH HIM
IF I DO IT I SHALL TAKE MY OWN TIME ABOUT IT NOT YOURS YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME THEN ASKED THE OTHER RECOILING A LITTLE AND MUCH MORE SUBDUED IN HIS TONE
THE BANKER LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF PERPLEXITY AND THEN ASKED WHERE HE WAS
SHE HAD BEEN PROUD OF HIS GENTLEMANLY BEARING HIS CLEVERNESS HIS AIR OF SUPERIORITY OVER OTHER MEN OF HIS STATION
SIR PHILIP JOCELYN WAS NOT WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED AN INTELLECTUAL MAN
THE TWOPENCE SEEMED A RIDICULOUS ANTI-CLIMAX
THE LIGHT OF A LAMP SUSPENDED FROM THE GROINED ROOF OF THE PORCH SHONE UPON THE TWO MEN'S FACES
CHAPTER XXV
SUCH UTTER DESOLATION HAD DESCENDED UPON HER SINCE HER MISERABLE JOURNEY TO WINCHESTER AND HER USELESS VISIT TO PORTLAND PLACE
THE WANDERING AVON FLOWED THROUGH THIS RUSTIC CHURCHYARD ALONG A WINDING CHANNEL FRINGED BY TALL TREMBLING RUSHES
AND WITH EVERY THOUGHT OF THE PENNILESS REPROBATE THERE WAS INTERMINGLED THE MEMORY OF THE WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE HIM BY HENRY DUNBAR
HIS MIND WAS RACKED BY ANXIETY ABOUT THE MISSING GIRL
THE CARRIAGES ARRIVED AT LAST
BUT WAS IT PROBABLE--WAS IT EVEN POSSIBLE--THAT THE MURDERER WOULD HAVE LINGERED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WITH EVERY CHANCE AGAINST HIM LONG ENOUGH TO STRIP OFF THE GARMENTS OF HIS VICTIM IN ORDER STILL MORE EFFECTUALLY TO HOODWINK SUSPICION
I WONDER WHETHER SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE ME
SHE WAS ALARMED BY YOUR MESSAGE TO MR BALDERBY I SHALL NOT WRITE SAID THE BANKER
AND IN THE MEAN TIME HENRY DUNBAR MAY ARRIVE AT SOUTHAMPTON HURRY ON TO LONDON AND I MAY MISS THE ONE CHANCE OF MEETING THAT MAN FACE TO FACE
AND AS HE IS MOST LIKELY SOME WRETCHEDLY IGNORANT BOOR HE WILL VERY PROBABLY TRY TO SELL THEM WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE SCENE OF THE CRIME I HOPE HE WILL BE FOUND SAID MR BALDERBY FILLING HIS GLASS WITH CLARET AS HE SPOKE
BUT PASSIONATE AND SELF-WILLED
THREE WHO SUSPECT XIX
THAT ONE ERROR THAT ONE WICKED ACT WAS HIS RUIN
I DON'T BELIEVE THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CULPABLE
THE WINE'S RATHER COLD
IN HIS OWN HOUSE SURROUNDED BY PRYING SERVANTS HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ASSAIL THIS GIRL BY SO MUCH AS A HARSH WORD
AND A VERY NICE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HE IS HE'S SETTLED IN SHORNCLIFFE I SUPPOSE WELL I BELIEVE HE IS SIR
HE COULD HAVE BEST SERVED HIS OWN INTERESTS BY STAYING WITH ME
MY FATHER NEVER MET ANY ONE NOBLE ENOUGH TO STRETCH OUT HIS HAND TO THE OUTCAST AND SAY I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE WRONG
YES SIR--BY GAD SIR HIS OFFICIAL ROBES
UPON WHICH THE OLD WOMAN USHERED THE BARONET AND HIS WIFE INTO A SALOON DISTINGUISHED BY AN AIR OF FADED SPLENDOUR AND IN WHICH THE FRENCH CLOCKS AND ORMOLU CANDELABRAS WERE IN THE PROPORTION OF TWO TO ONE TO THE CHAIRS AND TABLES
BUT MADAME HE SAID THIS MONSIEUR KERSTALL'S FATHER IS VERY OLD AND HE HAS CEASED TO PAINT IT IS A LONG TIME
STRANGE TO SAY THIS ARTIST WHOSE NAME I FORGET DELAYED FROM DAY TO DAY PERFORMING HIS PROMISE AND AT THE EXPIRATION OF A TWELVEMONTH LEFT ENGLAND FOR ITALY TAKING THE YOUNG MAN'S PORTRAIT WITH HIM AMONGST A LOT OF OTHER UNFRAMED CANVASES
AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON THE DETECTIVE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE SHORNCLIFFE STATION WHERE HE HIRED A FLY AND DROVE ON POST-HASTE TO LISFORD COTTAGE
MADGE SAID JAMES WENTWORTH THROWING HIS PIPE ASIDE AND LOOKING FULL AT HIS DAUGHTER I SIT AND WATCH YOU SOMETIMES TILL I BEGIN TO WONDER AT YOU
BLESS MY SOUL
MY MOTHER WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A GENTLEMAN A POST-CAPTAIN IN THE ROYAL NAVY WHOSE NAME WAS TALBOT
I CAN'T SEE ANY ONE
IT WAS NO GRIEF TO HER TO TOIL TAKING LONG WEARY WALKS AND GIVING TEDIOUS LESSONS FOR THE SMALL STIPENDS WHICH HER EMPLOYERS HAD THE CONSCIENCE TO OFFER HER
THE JURYMEN STARED AGHAST AT THE CORONER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN AWE-STRICKEN BY HIS IMPERTINENCE TOWARDS THE CHIEF PARTNER OF THE GREAT BANKING-HOUSE OF DUNBAR DUNBAR AND BALDERBY
THE GIRL'S FACE DROOPING OVER HER WORK WAS VERY FAIR
THE POLICE GREW HOPELESS AT LAST
AND WHEN I TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AT HIM THE DROPS OF PERSPIRATION WAS ROLLIN DOWN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE BEADS
MY FRIEND'S A DEEP ONE A CURSEDLY DEEP ONE
HOW IS SHE NOW CLEMENT ASKED
I HAVEN'T THE FINE APPETITE I HAD FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MR GILWOOD HE SAID TO THE LANDLORD WHEN MY MOTHER YONDER WHO HASN'T GROWN FIFTEEN DAYS OLDER IN ALL THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS,--BLESS HER DEAR MOTHERLY HEART!--USED TO COME DOWN TO SEE ME AT THE ACADEMY IN THE LISFORD ROAD AND GIVE ME A DINNER IN THIS DEAR OLD ROOM
ARTHUR LOVELL STILL WATCHING HIM SAW THAT HIS STRONG WHITE HAND TREMBLED A LITTLE AS HIS FINGERS TRIFLED WITH THOSE GLITTERING TOYS HANGING TO HIS WATCH-CHAIN
WOULD TO HEAVEN LAURA THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
WELL HE SAID UNLESS I'M VERY MUCH MISTAKEN I THINK I'VE GOT MY FRIEND THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY YOU DO
PERHAPS THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ADMIRED MARGARET WENTWORTH WOULD HAVE COME NEARER THE MARK IF THEY HAD SAID THAT SHE WAS A LADY BY RIGHT DIVINE OF HER OWN BEAUTIFUL NATURE WHICH HAD NEVER REQUIRED TO BE SCHOOLED INTO GRACE OR GENTLENESS
DO YOU DENY IT JOSEPH WILMOT HE ASKED
A SAD STORY,--A VERY SAD STORY
AND DON'T YOU PRESHUME TO COME TO SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS DURIN GENTLEFOLKS DINNER-HOURS ANOTHER TIME
I WAS ARRESTED FOR FORGERY TRIED FOUND GUILTY AND TRANSPORTED FOR LIFE
HE WALKED ALONG THE AISLE WITH HIS HEAD UP DASHING AND MILLINGTARY-LIKE
WHETHER HE HAD BORNE THE RANK OF AN OFFICER AND HAD SOLD HIS COMMISSION OR HAD BEEN CASHIERED OR HAD DESERTED OR HAD BEEN DRUMMED-OUT OF HIS REGIMENT,--NO ONE PRETENDED TO SAY
NO YOU DON'T
AND HER STATEMENT WAS WRITTEN DOWN AND SIGNED AS UPON THE PREVIOUS DAY
BUT THE CORONER WAS NOT A VERY CLOSE OBSERVER AND MR DUNBAR'S EAGER GLANCE ESCAPED HIM ALTOGETHER
THEY WERE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE-HALL
BUT I CANNOT HOPE FOR SO MUCH MERCY FROM MEN
QUEER-ABOUT THE HEELS OF HIS BOOTS
DO YOU THINK OF RETURNING TO WARWICKSHIRE MR LOVELL OH YES IMMEDIATELY
CHAPTER XXXVI
HE TOOK NO INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY BUT LOUNGED FAR BACK IN THE CARRIAGE AND COMPLAINED VERY MUCH OF THE COLD
AT THE FETE CHAMPETRE THEY MET AGAIN
FATE DARKLY BROODING OVER THESE TWO MEN THROUGHOUT HALF A LONG LIFETIME HAD HELD THEM ASUNDER FOR FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS TO FLING THEM MYSTERIOUSLY TOGETHER NOW
I AM QUITE READY TO SERVE YOU--FOR THE SAKE OF AULD LANG SYNE YES ANSWERED THE MAJOR WITH A SNEER
LISTEN TO ME MARGARET
A DREAMY DROWSY FORGOTTEN CITY WHERE THE ONLY CHANGES OF THE SLOW DAY WOULD BE THE VARYING CHIMES OF THE CATHEDRAL CLOCK THE DIFFERENT TONES OF THE CATHEDRAL BELLS
NOT JOSEPH WILMOT MUTTERED MR CARTER
MY FATHER HAS BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME VERY INDULGENT VERY GENEROUS
DO YOU UNDERSTAND I SHALL PERHAPS WHEN I SEE THE MONEY FOR IT THE LANGUID YOUTH ANSWERED WITH A SNEER
BUT YOU WANTED THE THINGS FOUND AND YOU'VE HAD EM FOUND YES
HE HAD FIRES IN HIS BEDROOM AND DRESSING-ROOM EVERY NIGHT
THUS IT WAS THAT TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE WEEK IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER HIS RETURN FROM INDIA VISITED THE BANKING-OFFICES CLEMENT AUSTIN HANDED A FORMAL NOTICE OF RESIGNATION TO MR BALDERBY
SO FOR THE THIRD TIME HE ESCAPED FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH MARGARET WILMOT
AND MR DUNBAR'S ARMS WERE EMBLAZONED UPON THE BACK
YOU CAN COME INTO THE WAITING-ROOM WITH ME AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN YOUR TICKET THE CLERK STARED AGHAST
AND IN ONE OF THESE A PLEASANT PLACE ENOUGH THERE IS A ROW OF OLD-FASHIONED SEMI-DETACHED COTTAGES STANDING IN SMALL GARDENS AND SHELTERED BY SYCAMORES AND LABURNUMS FROM THE DUST WHICH IN DRY SUMMER WEATHER LIES THICK UPON THE NARROW ROADWAY
AND HE DO SWEAR SO WHEN HE'S IN HIS TANTRUMS
HE WAS EVIDENTLY GROWING RATHER IMPATIENT OF THE OLD CLERK'S RAMBLING TALK
IT'S MISERABLY WET
AS HE HAD BROODED IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE AS HE HAD BROODED IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF THE INN
HE INSISTED UPON MY RETURNING TO THE OFFICE DIRECTLY HE HEARD THE SECRET OF MY RESIGNATION
AND HER LIMBS TREMBLED EVERY NOW AND THEN WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING AND HER WORDS SEEMED TO DIE AWAY AS SHE TRIED TO UTTER THEM
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU VERY PARTICULAR THE CORNET'S JAW DROPPED AND HIS FACE TURNED GHASTLY WHITE AS I SAID THIS
MAJOR VERNON WAS NOT GOING TO CHURCH ON THIS BRIGHT WINTER'S MORNING
AND DON'T YOU FRET YOUR PRECIOUS HEART MY BLESSED MISS LAURA IF THE RAIN IS CONTRAIRY
THE MAJOR LOOKED LIKE A VULGAR-MINDED MEPHISTOPHELES
IT WAS MERELY A COINCIDENCE I ASSURE YOU
BUT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE MEDICINE WAS OFFERED TO HER
I'VE BEEN TALKING OF THINGS THAT ALWAYS SEEM TO SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE
I REALLY AM QUITE ANXIOUS TO SEE THE NEW HEAD OF THE HOUSE
GOOD EVENING MRS AUSTIN SHE TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE BUT HER VOICE FAILED HER
FOR I WILL FOLLOW HIM TO THE END OF THE WORLD
SHE HEARD THE LOW SOUND OF THE LIGHT ASHES FALLING ON THE HEARTH AND THE SHORTING BREATH OF A DOG
HE DID GO SIR,--HE SOLD HIS COMMISSION AND LEFT ENGLAND BY THE ORONOKO
IT HAS ALL BEEN PLACED IN OLD MR DUNBAR'S BED-ROOM SIR THE MAN ANSWERED
FOR LADY JOCELYN WAS STILL ON THE CONTINENT
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF HAVING HIM HE SAID AND THAT'S THE DIAMONDS
HE HAD BEEN A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH THE BROTHERS
THE RUE CAILOUX WAS A VERY QUIET LITTLE STREET--A NARROW WINDING STREET WITH TALL SHABBY-LOOKING HOUSES AND UNTIDY-LITTLE GREENGROCERS SHOPS PEEPING OUT HERE AND THERE
ONCE SHE PUT HER HAND MECHANICALLY TO THE BELT OF HER DRESS AND THEN SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A SIGH AS SHE DREW IT AWAY
HE HAD TEMPTED MY BROTHER TO DO WRONG AND THE LEAST HE COULD HAVE DONE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO TRY TO SHIELD HIM
HE SEEMED TO SHRINK FROM MEETING ANY ONE OR TALKING TO ANY ONE
NOTHING COULD BE FIRMER THAN THE TONE OF THIS LETTER IN SPITE OF ITS PENSIVE GENTLENESS
THERE'S MY HAND UPON IT HE GAVE MARGARET HIS HAND KISSED HER SMOOTH CHEEKS TOOK HIS CANE FROM A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THEN WENT OUT
MARGARET WAS LYING DRESSED IN THE DAMP DRAGGLED GOWN WHICH SHE HAD WORN THAT AFTERNOON UPON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BED
SHE CAME OUT OF MARGARET'S ROOM AND WENT TO MEET CLEMENT
MRS MADDEN WAS INDIGNANT AT THIS UNCEREMONIOUS MANNER OF ARRANGING MATTERS
MY GOOD FELLOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK ME FULL IN THE FACE MR DUNBAR AND TELL ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING THERE THAT REMINDS YOU OF THE PAST HENRY DUNBAR STARTED
HAD OUR RESOURCES BEEN REDUCED WE SHOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER TO PLEASE
SIR PHILIP JOCELYN WALKED ON AIR AS HE QUITTED THE BANKER'S APARTMENTS
BUT YOU MUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND AT ONCE DO YOU WISH ME TO GO TO INDIA FATHER DO I WISH YOU TO GO TO INDIA
CLEMENT AUSTIN'S WOOING
HE WAS NOT CONVINCED
AND HE WALKS INTO THE COFFEE-ROOM AND I MAKES BOLD TO FOLLER HIM
THIS MAN TOLD THE DETECTIVE THAT HE HAD BEEN FETCHED IN THE EVENING BY THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN WHO FETCHED HIM IN THE MORNING AND THAT HE HAD DRIVEN ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WHO WALKED LAME LIKE THE FIRST AND HAD HIS HEAD AND FACE WRAPPED UP A DEAL NOT TO SHORNCLIFFE STATION BUT TO LITTLE PETHERINGTON STATION SIX MILES ON THE RUGBY SIDE OF SHORNCLIFFE WHERE THE GENTLEMAN AND THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS WITH HIM GOT INTO A SECOND-CLASS CARRIAGE IN THE SLOW TRAIN FOR RUGBY
AH YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
I FEAR THAT SHE WILL HAVE BEEN VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU ALL THIS DAY
THE WEDDING-BREAKFAST WAS A VERY SILENT MEAL FOR THE FACE OF THE GIVER OF THE FEAST WAS AS GLOOMY AS THE SKY ABOVE MAUDESLEY ABBEY
BUT MARGARET WILMOT DID NOT CEASE TO REMEMBER MR DUNBAR SHE ONLY WAITED
BUT MR DUNBAR TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS
IT WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND INVOLVED A GREAT DEAL OF FOLDING SORTING AND ARRANGING OF DOCUMENTS WHICH PERHAPS WERE SCARCELY WORTH THE TROUBLE I TOOK WITH THEM
I WILL SPEAK TO HER BEFORE HER FATHER RETURNS HE THOUGHT
BUT I DID NOT KNOW YET WHAT IT WAS THEY WANTED TO FIND BUT THEY FOUND IT GASPED THE GIRL'S FATHER
I CAN WALK SHE SAID
I BEGIN TO DESPAIR OF FINDING MY FATHER'S PORTRAIT SHE SAID
I THINK IT WOULD BE ONLY A PROPER ACT OF GRATITUDE
THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COURSE WHO CARED VERY LITTLE FOR MISS DUNBAR OR HER ANXIETY
I WAS OBLIGED TO HIDE MYSELF--AND TO KEEP AT A DISTANCE FOR CLEMENT WAS THERE ALL DAY
THE PRISONER IS REMANDED
AT DAYBREAK THE NEXT MORNING SHE LEFT THE HOUSE AFTER GIVING A VERY BRIEF EXPLANATION OF HER DEPARTURE TO THE OLD WOMAN WITH WHOM SHE LODGED
SHE WAS SUCH A WOMAN AS MIGHT HAVE SAT BY THE SIDE OF AN ENGLISH KING TO PLEAD FOR ALL TREMBLING PETITIONERS KNEELING ON THE STEPS OF THE THRONE
THERE WAS SOMETHING DISRESPECTFUL NOT TO SAY IRONICAL IN HIS TONE
ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE STOOD MY MOTHER'S WORK-TABLE ON THE OTHER THE DESK AT WHICH I WROTE WHENEVER I WROTE ANY LETTERS AT HOME--A PONDEROUS OLD-FASHIONED OFFICE DESK WITH A ROW OF DRAWERS ON EACH SIDE A DEEP WELL IN THE CENTRE AND UNDER THAT A LARGE WASTE-PAPER BASKET FULL OF OLD ENVELOPES AND TORN SCRAPS OF LETTERS
HE HAD DONE ALL THIS CAUTIOUSLY TAKING CARE TO MAKE SURE EVERY NOW AND THEN THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED
MISS ELIZABETH LESTER SEEMED TO WANT EVERYTHING THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE HUMAN MIND TO IMAGINE OR DESIRE
AT THE MOMENT OF HIS DOING SO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN CAME OUT OF THE WAITING-ROOM
THE TELLING OF THIS THOUGH I TOLD IT BRIEFLY OCCUPIED NEARLY AN HOUR
THIS PERSON IS WITH HIM THE COUNTRY SURGEON GLANCED RATHER SUSPICIOUSLY AT JOSEPH WILMOT
MY DEAR LOVELL IS THAT YOU
BUT SHE TOLD HIM NO MORE
AND YOU'VE FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY FROM WARWICKSHIRE AND TRACED ME STEP BY STEP I SUPPOSE AND TAKEN NO END OF TROUBLE EH
YES THE MEN SAID IT WAS QUEER
IT MAY SEEM LATE IN THE DAY TO BID YOU WELCOME TO THE BANK MR DUNBAR SAID THE JUNIOR PARTNER BUT I DO SO NEVERTHELESS--MOST HEARTILY THERE WAS A FLATNESS IN THE ACCENT IN WHICH THESE TWO LAST WORDS WERE SPOKEN WHICH WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A FALSE COIN WHEN IT FALLS DEAD UPON A COUNTER AND PROCLAIMS ITSELF SPURIOUS
IT HAD BEEN A VERY GRAND PLACE IN THE COACHING-DAYS AND YOU ENTERED THE HOSTELRY BY A BROAD AND PONDEROUS ARCHWAY UNDER WHICH HIGHFLYERS AND ELECTRICS HAD DRIVEN TRIUMPHANTLY IN THE DAYS THAT WERE FOR EVER GONE
THERE WAS A PURSE LYING ON A DRESSING-TABLE WITH SOVEREIGNS GLITTERING THROUGH THE SILKEN NETWORK AND THE GIRL SNATCHED IT UP AS SHE HURRIED AWAY THINKING IN HER INNOCENT SIMPLICITY THAT HER FATHER MIGHT HAVE NOTHING BUT THOSE FEW SOVEREIGNS TO HELP HIM IN HIS FLIGHT
HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN DISHONEST BUT FOR HENRY DUNBAR SHE REMEMBERED WITH BITTER FEELINGS THE ASPECT OF THE RICH MAN'S HOUSE IN PORTLAND PLACE
YOUR DEAR MOTHER WILL BE ALARMED IF YOU ARE VERY LONG ABSENT
THERE WAS GOLDEN PLATE THAT A KING HAD GIVEN TO HIS PROUD YOUNG FAVOURITE IN THOSE FEUDAL DAYS WHEN FAVOURITES WERE POWERFUL IN ENGLAND
THIS TIME HENRY DUNBAR DID NOT SPEAK SO MUCH OF HIS ANXIETY TO GET AWAY UPON THE SECOND STAGE OF HIS CONTINENTAL JOURNEY
IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE KNEW THE STORY OF THE FORGED BILLS
WHEN IT GREW DUSK JOSEPH WILMOT LEFT THE LITTLE INN AND WALKED BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON
YOU'LL FIND ME SUPERINTENDING THE WORK IT WAS ABOUT HALF-PAST EIGHT WHEN MR CARTER LEFT ME
HENRY DUNBAR'S HEAD WAS BENT OVER THE FIRE AND HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN A KIND OF DOZING SLEEP AS MARGARET WILMOT WENT INTO THE ROOM
IDLE PEDESTRIANS HAD STROLLED THROUGH THE GROVE IN THE STILL TWILIGHT
FROM HIS NEW ABODE MR VERNON WAS ABLE TO KEEP A TOLERABLY SHARP LOOK-OUT UPON THE TWO GREAT HOUSES IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD--MAUDESLEY ABBEY AND JOCELYN'S ROCK
NEITHER I NOR ANY RATIONAL CREATURE UPON THIS EARTH ABLE TO READ ENGLISH CHARACTERS COULD HAVE WELL MADE OUT THAT NAME OTHERWISE THAN I MADE IT OUT
THAT FROM THE BRUISES AND MARKS ON THE THROAT AND NECK SOME CONTUSIONS ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND OTHER APPEARANCES ON THE BODY WHICH WITNESS MINUTELY DESCRIBED HE SAID THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF A STRUGGLE HAVING TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN DECEASED AND SOME OTHER PERSON OR PERSONS
IT'S AS WELL TO STICK TO ONE INITIAL ON ACCOUNT OF ONE'S LINEN FROM THE VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF LINEN EXHIBITED IN THE MAJOR'S TOILETTE A MALICIOUS PERSON MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SUCH A THING AS A SHIRT WAS A LUXURY NOT INCLUDED IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S WARDROBE
AND MR BALDERBY PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS ONLY A FORMULA WHICH MR DUNBAR FELT HIMSELF CALLED UPON TO GO THROUGH
THERE IS A YOUNG LADY HERE CLEMENT SAID BREATHLESSLY
HE IS OFTEN AWAY
IT'S A BAD CASE SAID HE
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING MY DEAR BOY CLEMENT LOOKED ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE ANSWERED
I AM SORRY FOR MYSELF AND FOR THE TORTURE WHICH I HAVE CREATED FOR MYSELF
THE VERY MAN HE WANTED GONE--GONE AWAY IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT WHILE ALL THE HOUSEHOLD WAS SLEEPING
YOU SEE IT ALL NOW DON'T YOU SAID MR CARTER
BUT HE SAW VERY LITTLE OF THE MASTER OF MAUDESLEY ABBEY
I SHALL START FOR WINCHESTER TO-MORROW MORNING THEN I'LL GO WITH YOU CLEMENT SAID PROMPTLY
BUT WHAT OF THAT THOUGHT MR VINCENT
SHE DRANK THE SPIRIT EAGERLY
YES I WILL DESCRIBE HER
THE WORTHY INHABITANTS OF LISFORD WERE ALMOST AS MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNPROMISING ASPECT OF THE SKY AS LAURA DUNBAR AND HER FAITHFUL NURSE THEMSELVES
YOU'RE KEEPING SOMETHING BACK THOUGH YOU'VE HALF A MIND TO TRUST ME
OTHER MURDERS WERE COMMITTED AS BRUTAL IN THEIR NATURE AS THE MURDER IN THE GROVE
THE CHARIOT HAD COST NEARLY THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND WAS VERY WELL BUILT
BUT WE CALL IT A TALLOW-DROP BECAUSE IT'S VERY MUCH THE SHAPE OF A DROP OF TALLOW
DEAREST MOTHER DON'T LOOK SO PUZZLED ADDED CLEMENT
PHILIP JOCELYN AND LAURA DUNBAR MET AT THAT DINNER-PARTY WHICH THE MILLIONAIRE GAVE TO HIS FRIENDS IN CELEBRATION OF HIS RETURN
SHE WAS A LITTLE CAPRICIOUS JUST A TRIFLE WAYWARD I WILL CONFESS
THE DETECTIVE ASKED IF THIS WASN'T RATHER A QUEER PROCEEDING
AND THAT TOOTHACHE'S ONLY A JUDGMENT UPON YOU
HIS WIDOW AN ELDERLY LADY WAS STILL LIVING AT THE FERNS
A MAN THAT WALKS LAME THE PAWNBROKER SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT HAPPENED FORTUNATELY THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING OF JOSEPH WILMOT'S ANTECEDENTS OR OF THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO NORFOLK ISLAND
BUT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD CALL UPON HIS WIDOW FROM WHOM I SHOULD NO DOUBT HEAR THE HISTORY OF MY POOR FRIEND'S LAST MOMENTS
HE KNOWS THAT THE SCENT OF BLOOD IS IN THE AIR AND THAT THE BLOODHOUNDS ARE AT THEIR LOATHSOME WORK
AND THEN WHEN THE LESSON IS CONCLUDED MY MOTHER ROUSES HERSELF FROM HER AFTER-DINNER NAP AND ASKS MARGARET TO TAKE A CUP OF TEA AND EVEN INSISTS ON HER ACCEPTING THAT FEMININE HOSPITALITY
GIVE ME YOUR ADDRESS JOSEPH AND I WILL WRITE TO YOU OH YES I DARE SAY ANSWERED HIS BROTHER SCORNFULLY
SIR PHILIP GAVE HIS CARD TO THE OLD WOMAN AND SHE CARRIED IT INTO THE ADJOINING CHAMBER WHENCE THERE ISSUED A GUSH OF TOBACCO-SMOKE AS THE DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS WAS OPENED AND THEN SHUT AGAIN
I AM DISTRACTED BY THIS SERIOUS CALAMITY LAURA LOOKED IMPLORINGLY AT THE DETECTIVE
NOW MR AUSTIN THERE'S A FEW WORDS I MUST SAY BEFORE WE BEGIN BUSINESS
DOWN HE DROPPED UPON THAT BENCH LIKE A STONE
YOU STOP HERE SAWNEY HE ADDED ASIDE TO HIS ATTENDANT
I WANT TO KNOW IF SUCH A PERSON HAS BEEN TO YOU TO-DAY THE DIAMONDS ARE ALL RIGHT ASKED THE PAWNBROKER RATHER NERVOUSLY
ON THE EVENING OF THE 15TH OF AUGUST 1850 THREE MEN SAT TOGETHER IN ONE OF THE SHADY OFFICES AT THE BACK OF THE BANKING-HOUSE IN ST GUNDOLPH LANE
THE WORLD HAS SMILED UPON HIM
I'LL GO AND SEE HOW MISS WILMOT IS NOW THE CASHIER SAID
THE PITEOUS WAIL OF CHILDREN WHO CLUNG WARM AND LIVING TO THE BREASTS OF DEAD MOTHERS MARTYRED IN THAT MOMENT OF DESTRUCTION
I PROMISED MY DEAD FATHER THAT I WOULD REMEMBER THE NAME OF HENRY DUNBAR
IF MY SHOPMAN HAS BEEN IMPERTINENT HE HAS INTERRUPTED JOSEPH
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THE SNOW MAY AFFECT THE ENGINE
WAS I WHO HAD FLIRTED WITH THE MISS BALDERBYS
HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE THE NEXT MORNING AND AT LISFORD CHURCH
I COULD ALMOST HAVE SWORN TO THAT CHAIN BECAUSE OF THE COLOUR OF THE GOLD WHICH WAS A PARTICULAR DEEP YALLER
I MADE THAT PROMISE FOR THE SAKE OF AULD LANG SYNE ANSWERED MR DUNBAR
THE DOOR OF HIS FATHER'S SITTING-ROOM WAS AJAR AND THE LAWYER HEARD HIS SON'S STEP IN THE HALL
MY MOTHER HAS BEEN QUITE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU MISS WENTWORTH SAID CLEMENT AUSTIN
BUT LOR MR AUSTIN IF I COULDN'T LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WATCH YOU AT THE SAME TIME I SHOULDN'T BE WORTH MY SALT TO YOU OR ANY ONE ELSE
I HAVE OTHER DUTIES TO PERFORM
HE HAD NOT BEEN A GOOD FATHER BUT SHE HAD LOVED HIM NEVERTHELESS
BY THE TIME SEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK CLEMENT AUSTIN'S PATIENCE HAD GIVEN UP THE GHOST
YOU ARE A GOOD MAN MR AUSTIN MARGARET WROTE
BUT I CAN'T BE WISE
THAT WILL DEPEND UPON--I DON'T KNOW
WHY IF YOU COULD HAVE A HANGEL IN THE DETECTIVE BUSINESS--WHICH LUCKILY YOU CAN'T FOR THE WINGS WOULD CUT OUT ANYTHING AS MEAN AS LEGS AND BE THE RUIN OF THE PURFESSION--THE TEMPER OF THAT HANGEL WOULD GIVE WAY UNDER WHAT I'VE GONE THROUGH
I HAVE COME TO THIS HOUSE IN SEARCH OF--OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO WENT AWAY LAST NIGHT
AND THREE-FOURTHS OF THE BANK
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER HE WORE A WATCH AND CHAIN HE SAID
BUT THEY ONLY SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS AND SAID THE CIRCUMSTANCES LOOKED QUEER BUT WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO ACT UPON
CALL ME VERNON HE SAID
THE EYES THEMSELVES WERE UNNATURALLY BRIGHT
OR LISTENING TO THE CINDERS FALLING FROM THE GRATE AND THE MOANING OF THE WINTER WIND AMONGST THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE ELMS
HE SPOKE PRESENTLY IN A VERY EARNEST VOICE BUT WITH HIS HEAD STILL TURNED AWAY FROM LAURA
HE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT THE MEANS OF FOLLOWING HIS ASSISTANT AND THE LAME TRAVELLER
MY INDIAN HABITS HAVE UNFITTED ME FOR ANY EXERTION
THE OTHER END HE LEFT OPEN
HAD THE VICTIM BEEN A STRONG MAN HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE RESISTED THE ATTACK AND MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED HIS ASSAILANT TIGHTENING THE FATAL KNOT
FOR THE PERSON WITH WHOM I LODGE IS OLD AND DEAF
THE MAN HELD THE TWO WAX-CANDLES ON THE RIGHT HAND OF THE DETECTIVE AS HE SAT BEFORE THE TABLE
AND THE PAPERS MENTIONED IT VERY FAVOURABLY SIR
YOU'VE SEEN ME TRY FIRST ONE TRADE AND THEN ANOTHER AND FAIL IN EVERY ONE OF THEM
BUT I HAVE A FANCY FOR BUYING THE DIAMONDS UPON PAPER AND HAVING THEM MADE UP AFTER A DESIGN OF MY OWN
I SHOULD WISH YOU TO CHOOSE DIAMONDS OF MODERATE SIZE BUT NOT SMALL
THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH FADED TAPESTRY FROM WHICH GRIM FACES SCOWLED UPON THE LONELY INHABITANT OF THE CHAMBERS
NO NO MISS DUNBAR EXCLAIMED MR BALDERBY ANXIOUS TO REASSURE HER
BUT I WILL GO AND HE DID GO SAID MR BALDERBY
AND THE DEAR DROWSY SLOW TRAINS WITH AN ABSURD GUARD WHO TALKS AN UNINTELLIGIBLE PATOIS AND THE OTHER MAN WHO ALWAYS LOSES ONE'S LUGGAGE
BUT MY MOTHER CANNOT BE INDIFFERENT TO YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND SHE AND I HAVE BOTH PERCEIVED THE CHANGE
I MUST HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH MOSELLE AT LUNCHEON TO-DAY HE SAID LAUGHING OR AT LEAST MY ENEMIES MIGHT SAY SO IF THEY WERE TO SEE ME PUZZLED TO FIND THE KEY OF MY OWN DESK HE HAD OPENED THE BOX BY THIS TIME AND WAS EXAMINING ONE OF THE NUMEROUS PACKETS OF PAPERS WHICH WERE ARRANGED IN VERY METHODICAL ORDER CAREFULLY TIED TOGETHER AND NEATLY ENDORSED
DORA MACMAHON CAME IN PRESENTLY LOOKING VERY PRETTY IN BLUE SILK AND WHITE LACE
SO AT LAST THE INSPECTION WAS ENDED
IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO DO SO THE SOONER YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM THE BETTER FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WISH TO ESCAPE THE HUMILIATION OF BEING TURNED OUT BY THE WAITER AT THE END OF THIS SPEECH JOSEPH WILMOT LOOKED UP FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND AT FIRST MR DUNBAR HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED OF THE CRIME,--THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WAS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS
I PUSHED ASIDE THE LETTER TO MY MOTHER AND WAITED WITH A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE ME
YES THIS IS RUGBY ANSWERED THE SURGEON SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS ALMOST AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID NOW ISN'T THAT DELIGHTFUL YES THIS IS THE QUEEN'S HOTEL RUGBY
IT WAS MARGARET MARGARET HERSELF MOST LIKELY WHO HAD COME TO MY DOOR
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS LAURA DEAREST
YOU'VE SEEN ME KNOCKED DOWN AND DISGRACED WHEREVER I TRIED TO GET A FOOTING
BUT ALL IN A MINUTE HE REELED AS IF HE'D BEEN DEAD DRUNK AND HE WOULD HAVE FELL IF THERE HADN'T BEEN A BENCH HANDY
THE WEDDING WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN LISFORD CHURCH--THAT PRETTY QUAINT OLD CHURCH OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN
AWAKE
A FEW VALUABLE CABINET PICTURES BY THE OLD MASTERS SET IN DEEP FRAMES OF EBONY AND GOLD HUNG AT WIDE DISTANCES UPON THE WALL
I DO SO WANT TO SEE THIS ONE AND TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF IT IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO SO AND YOU ARE OF OPINION THAT MY FATHER TOOK THE PICTURE TO ITALY WITH HIM WHEN HE LEFT ENGLAND MORE THAN FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AGO YES
BUT THE SICK MAN HAD ORDERED A HUGE FIRE TO BE MADE UP--A FIRE THAT PROMISED TO LAST FOR SOME HOURS
THE REST OF THE MEN STOOD BY BREATHLESS EAGERLY WATCHING TWO HEADS BOBBING UP AND DOWN AMONG THE MOONLIT WAVES TWO PAIRS OF ARMS BUFFETING WITH THE WATER
NOT EASILY TO BE DIVERTED FROM ANY PURPOSE HOWEVER LONG THE TIME BETWEEN THE FORMATION OF HIS RESOLVE AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF CARRYING IT INTO EXECUTION
BUT HE TRIED TO CARRY IT OFF WITH A SWAGGER AND FOLLOWED ME INTO MR PERCIVAL DUNBAR'S ROOM
TO LAURA DUNBAR THE WORLD WAS STILL ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL FOR THE DARKER SECRETS OF LIFE HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
BUT OH HOW TERRIBLE IF THIS WERE TRUE--HOW TERRIBLE TO THINK THAT LAURA DUNBAR WAS HENCEFORTH TO LIVE IN DAILY AND HOURLY ASSOCIATION WITH A TRAITOR AND AN ASSASSIN
LIFE SEEMED VERY BLANK TO CLEMENT AUSTIN WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONDON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MARGARET WILMOT'S DEPARTURE FROM THE REINDEER
THE GENIAL KIND OLD MASTER WHO HAD ALWAYS HAD A CHEERFUL FRIENDLY WORD FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS DEPENDANTS
HE IS MUCH BETTER JOSEPH ANSWERED
BUT LAURA JOCELYN SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I SHALL COME BACK EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING HE WALKED INTO THE WAITING-ROOM AND STOPPED THERE SEATED IN THE SAME ATTITUDE THE WHOLE TIME
FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR MR DUNBAR AMUSED HIMSELF BY INSPECTING THE CATHEDRAL
I HAVE LAIN AWAKE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WONDERING WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE BLIGHT THAT HAS BEEN UPON YOU AND ALL YOU HAVE DONE
HE HAD PUT AWAY THE PAST AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN AND CONCENTRATED ALL THE FORCE OF HIS MIND UPON THE ONE IDEA WHICH POSSESSED HIM LIKE SOME STRONG DEMON
YOU MAY AS WELL HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
NOT MUCH CHANGED HE MURMURED
WITHIN A MILE OF WHICH THE TOWERS OF JOCELYN'S ROCK CROWNED THE TALL CLIFF ABOVE THE RUSHING WATERS OF THE AVON
AND I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD PROFIT BY THAT CRIME
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE A FINGER IN THE PIE IF YOU LIKE AS LONG AS YOU'LL ENGAGE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE WHEN I TELL YOU CLEMENT PROMISED TO BE THE VERY SPIRIT OF DISCRETION
HIS UNCLE DIED TEN YEARS AGO AND HE WILL INHERIT THE FORTUNES OF BOTH FATHER AND UNCLE
HENRY DUNBAR'S DEADLY PALLOR--THAT WILD SCARED LOOK IN HIS EYES AS THEY SLOWLY REOPENED AND GLARED UPON LAURA'S ANXIOUS FACE--WERE EVER PRESENT TO THE YOUNG LAWYER'S MIND
THAT LOVING MOTHER WAS READY TO SYMPATHIZE WITH EVERY TROUBLE THAT AFFECTED HER ONLY SON
THE MILLIONAIRE CONTEMPLATED HIS POSSESSIONS
BUT GO WHERE I WOULD I SAW NO SIGN OF HER
DO YOU FORGET THAT LETTER WHICH I SHOWED YOU LONG AGO A LETTER ADDRESSED TO MY FATHER WHEN HE WAS A TRANSPORTED FELON SUFFERING THE PENALTY OF HIS CRIME
HE'S HER FATHER AND I'D KNEEL DOWN LIKE THE LITTLE BOYS IN THE STREETS AND CLEAN HIS BOOTS IF HE WANTED THEM CLEANED BECAUSE HE IS HER FATHER THOUGHT THE YOUNG MAN
THE DETECTIVE WAS USHERED THROUGH THE TWO OUTER ROOMS LEADING TO THAT TAPESTRIED APARTMENT IN WHICH THE MISSING MAN HAD SPENT SO MANY MISERABLE DAYS SO MANY DISMAL NIGHTS
THAT'S THE VERY THING I SAY MYSELF DEAR BOY
THE FISHERMAN IN THE SCARLET GUERNSEY MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES CARRYING A GREAT STONE BOTTLE WITH A TIN DRINKING-CUP TIED TO THE NECK OF IT AND A RUSH BASKET FILLED WITH SOME KIND OF PROVISION
IT IS A CASE IN WHICH MY SERVICES CAN BE OF VERY LITTLE AVAIL HE SAID
HE GOES BY THIS TRAIN
A MAN'S MEMORY SEEMS TO ME LIKE A BOOK OF PICTURES THAT HE MUST BE CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT WHETHER HE WILL OR NOT
AND I DO LOVE YOU JOSEPH--I DO LOVE YOU VERY DEARLY STILL
DON'T YOU BE AFRAID OF TELLING THE STORY BECAUSE IT'S A SENTIMENTAL ONE HE SAID
HE HAS BEEN PAINTING A LITTLE THIS MORNING AND IS IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS ABOUT HIS WORK
FOR HE WAS ALWAYS GRAVE AND SILENT
YOU HAVE BEGUN LIFE AT THE TOP OF THE TREE AND YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO FLING YOUR CHANCES INTO THE GUTTER
THE SIGHT OF THE OPEN HALL-DOOR AND THIS LANGUID FOOTMAN LOLLING IN THE PORCH SUDDENLY INSPIRED MARGARET WILMOT WITH A NEW IDEA
HOW DO YOU MEAN ALTERED ASKED THE BANKER ABSENTLY
CLEMENT RETURNED TO THE REINDEER HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH MARGARET AND MADE ALL ARRANGEMENTS
THE ROBBERY OF THE DEAD MAN'S CLOTHES AND SUCH PROPERTY AS HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ABOUT HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH GAVE A NEW ASPECT TO THE MURDER IN THE EYES OF ARTHUR LOVELL
YES KYLMINGTON WAS IN HAMPSHIRE
SINCE THAT STRANGE SCENE IN PORTLAND PLACE HE HAD SUSPECTED THE BANKER OF A FOUL AND TREACHEROUS MURDER,--THAT WORST AND DARKEST CRIME WHICH FOR EVER SEPARATES A MAN FROM THE SYMPATHY OF HIS FELLOW-MEN AND BRANDS HIM AS AN ACCURSED AND ABHORRED CREATURE BEYOND THE PALE OF HUMAN COMPASSION
