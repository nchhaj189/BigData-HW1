BESIDES HER NARROWNESS OF VISION MRS INCHBALD POSSESSES ANOTHER QUALITY NO LESS CHARACTERISTIC OF HER FRENCH PREDECESSORS AND NO LESS RARE AMONG THE NOVELISTS OF ENGLAND
THEY HAD JUST BEGUN TO PLAY WHEN LORD ELMWOOD CAME INTO THE ROOM--MISS MILNER'S COUNTENANCE IMMEDIATELY BRIGHTENED AND THOUGH SHE WAS IN A NEGLIGENT MORNING DRESS AND LOOKED PALER THAN USUAL SHE DID NOT LOOK LESS BEAUTIFUL
MORE WEARIED THAN REFRESHED WITH HER SLEEP SHE ROSE AT BREAK OF DAY AND REFUSING TO ADMIT OF THE CHANGE OF AN ARTICLE IN HER DRESS SHE PERSISTED TO SIT IN THE TORN DISORDERED HABIT IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DRAGGED AWAY
HE THEREFORE STOOD WHILE HE REPEATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH LORD FREDERICK
MISS WOODLEY WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE HAD CAUGHT THE INFECTION AND COULD NOT UTTER A WORD
WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE WE DON'T KNOW YET SIR
TO ME A COMMON RAKE IS AS ODIOUS AS A COMMON PROSTITUTE IS TO A MAN OF THE NICEST FEELINGS
DORRIFORTH INSTEAD OF BEING CONCERNED AS HE USUALLY WAS AT SEEING HER UNEASY APPEARED ON THE PRESENT OCCASION PROVOKED
MISS WOODLEY ENTERED AS IT WAS TRYING ON AND WAS ALL ASTONISHMENT AT THE ELEGANCE OF THE HABIT AND ITS BEAUTIFUL EFFECT UPON HER GRACEFUL PERSON
SHE FOUND HERSELF MORE THAN ONCE OBLIGED TO SHIFT HER LODGING
LADY ELMWOOD WAS SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF HIS WORDS AND THEIR IMPORT TO MAKE A SIGN AS IF SHE WISHED TO EMBRACE HIM
TIS LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER SAID LORD ELMWOOD AND I RETURN IT TO YOU FOR TWO REASONS SANDFORD TOOK IT AND PUTTING IT UP ASKED FEARFULLY WHAT THOSE TWO REASONS WERE FIRST SAID HE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A RELICK YOU MAY LIKE TO PRESERVE--MY SECOND REASON IS THAT YOU MAY SHEW IT TO HER DAUGHTER AND LET HER KNOW WHY AND ON WHAT CONDITIONS I GRANT HER MOTHER'S REQUEST YOU DO THEN GRANT IT CRIED SANDFORD JOYFULLY
RUSHBROOK FROM THE PERIL WHICH HAD SO LATELY THREATENED HIM WAS NOW IN HIS PERFECTLY COOL AND DISPASSIONATE SENSES
IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO GUESS WHO THIS RIVAL WAS
LORD ELMWOOD AT THIS TIME AND FOR MANY MONTHS BEFORE HAD BEEN DETAINED ABROAD BY A SEVERE AND DANGEROUS ILLNESS WHICH A TOO CAUTIOUS FEAR OF HER UNEASINESS HAD PROMPTED HIM TO CONCEAL
HE HAD SCARCE LEFT THE ROOM WHEN AN OFFICER WAITED UPON HIM WITH A CHALLENGE FROM LORD FREDERICK
THE PLEASURE OF LIVING IN A FINE HOUSE
IT IS MY LORD.--SHE WROTE IT A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED AND ENJOINED ME TO DELIVER IT TO YOU WITH MY OWN HANDS I REFUSE TO READ IT CRIED HE PUTTING IT FROM HIM--AND TREMBLING WHILE HE DID SO
BUT WEAKNESSES OF THIS KIND--AND IT WOULD BE EASY TO PROLONG THE LIST--ARE WHAT EVERY READER OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES WILL NOTICE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND WHAT NO WISE ONE WILL REGARD
HE NOW UNEQUIVOCALLY OFFERED MARRIAGE AND ENTREATED THAT HE MIGHT LAY HIS PROPOSALS BEFORE MR DORRIFORTH BUT THIS WAS POSITIVELY FORBIDDEN
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE MR SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY THAT YOU THINK MY PRESENCE AFFECTED LORD ELMWOOD SO AS TO MAKE HIM MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL
MISS WOODLEY BEHELD THE GLOW OF JOY AND OF GUILT UPON HER FACE AND DID NOT RISE TO GIVE HIM HER SEAT AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN SHE WAS SITTING BY HIS WARD AND HE CAME TO HER WITH INTELLIGENCE
HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD--SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF--TILL MRS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD BEEN AT THE OPERA WITH MISS MILNER CRIED BLESS ME MR SANDFORD ARE YOU NOT WELL YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE US SO EARLY HE REPLIED NO I HAVE A PAIN IN MY HEAD MISS MILNER WHO NEVER LISTENED TO COMPLAINTS WITHOUT SYMPATHY ROSE IMMEDIATELY FROM HER SEAT SAYING I THINK I NEVER HEARD YOU MR SANDFORD COMPLAIN OF INDISPOSITION BEFORE
LORD ELMWOOD SAID MISS MILNER IS VERY GRAVE--HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN PASSING THE EVENING WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVES PERHAPS HE IS MELANCHOLY AT PARTING FROM HER SAID MISS WOODLEY
AND BEING A MAN OF TALENTS WHOM ALL COMPANIES ESPECIALLY HER FRIENDS RESPECTED HE DID NOT BEGIN BY WASTING THAT REVERENCE SO HIGHLY VALUED UPON INEFFECTUAL REMONSTRANCES OF WHICH HE COULD FORESEE THE RECEPTION BUT WAKENED HER ATTENTION BY HIS NEGLECT OF HER
I WILL NOT SUFFER ANY EXPLANATION TO TAKE PLACE BUT LET MY LORD ELMWOOD ACT JUST AS HIS LOVE SHALL DICTATE
NOR WAS HE IN THE CLASS OF THOSE OF THE RELIGIOUS WHO BY SECLUDING THEMSELVES FROM THE WORLD FLY THE MERIT THEY MIGHT HAVE IN REFORMING MANKIND
SANDFORD SEEING HIS EMOTION WAS ANGRY WITH HIMSELF THAT HE HAD INADVERTENTLY MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
BUT HOW LITTLE HE WAS QUALIFIED TO ENFORCE A TENDER PASSION WAS A COMFORTABLE REFLECTION
HE HAD NOT ONCE NAMED HER THAT WAS NOT EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENTLY NO ONE DARED NAME HER TO HIM
IF NOT RECKON BUT AMONG THE MANY DUELS THAT ARE FOUGHT HOW FEW ARE FATAL
HE HOWEVER SEEMED LITTLE TOUCHED WITH HER BEHAVIOUR AND AS AN EXCUSE FOR BREAKING HIS WORD CRIED I BEG YOUR PARDON MADAM BUT I WAS BROUGHT HITHER IN MY ANXIETY TO PREVENT MURDER MURDER EXCLAIMED ALL THE LADIES
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS EVENT AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE HAD TIME TO CALL UP THEIR RECOLLECTION WERE SENT TO A NEIGHBOURING MAGISTRATE
THERE GIVING HIMSELF UP TO THE RAGE OF LOVE OR TO RAGE AGAINST DORRIFORTH FOR THE CONTEMPT HE HAD SHEWN TO HIM HE LEAPED FROM HIS HORSE WHEN MISS MILNER STEPPED FROM HER CARRIAGE AND SEIZING HER HAND ENTREATED HER NOT TO DESERT HIM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INJUNCTIONS OF MONKISH HYPOCRISY DORRIFORTH HEARD THIS STANDING SILENTLY BY WITH A MANLY SCORN UPON HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT IT IS THE MELODRAMA OF A RHETORICIAN AND IN THAT FINE SHE HEARD IT WITH COMPOSURE GENIUS HAS BRUSHED ASIDE THE FORCED AND THE OBVIOUS TO EXPRESS WITH SUPREME DIRECTNESS THE ANGUISH OF A SOUL
AND EVER ASSOCIATING THE IDEA OF MATILDA WITH MISS WOODLEY FELT HIS HEART BOUND WITH A TRIUMPH IT HAD NOT ENJOYED FOR MANY A DAY
HE HOPED SANDFORD MIGHT BE PRESENT AND YET HE WAS NOW ALMOST AS MUCH ASHAMED OF SEEING HIM AS HIS UNCLE WHOM HE HAD SO LATELY OFFENDED
CONFESSIONS ARE SOMETIMES CURIOUSLY DISCREET AND IN THE CASE OF MRS INCHBALD WE MAY BE SURE THAT IT IS ONLY WHAT WAS INDISCREET THAT WOULD REALLY BE WORTH THE HEARING
AND DESTITUTE AS YOU MAY THINK ME OF THE FRIENDSHIP OF LORD ELMWOOD IN THE ARDOUR WITH WHICH RUSHBROOK WAS WAITING TO EXPRESS HIMSELF HE INTERRUPTED HER AND CAUGHT HOLD OF HER HAND
I HAVE BUT A FEW DAYS TO REMAIN WITH HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND WE PART FOR EVER--DURING THOSE FEW DAYS IT IS NOT ONLY MY DUTY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS OR RATHER COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST BUT IT IS ALSO MY WISH TO LEAVE UPON HIS MIND AN IMPRESSION WHICH MAY NOT ADD TO THE ILL OPINION HE HAS FORMED OF ME BUT PERHAPS SERVE TO DIMINISH IT
MORE LIKELY OFFENDED SAID SANDFORD AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THAT LADY HAS SPOKEN OF HER WHO I
YOU MAY I WILL MY LORD AND USE ALL MY PERSUASION TO ENGAGE HIS OBEDIENCE
THE MANAGER IN CONSEQUENCE THOUGHT IT BUT JUSTICE TO ADVANCE THE ACTOR'S SALARY
HER SATISFACTION WAS AS EVIDENT AS EVERY OTHER PERSON'S
AT LENGTH OBSERVING HE ANSWERED MORE NEGLIGENTLY THAN USUAL TO WHAT HE SAID RUSHBROOK TURNED HIS EYES QUICKLY UPON HIM AND CRIED MY LORD ARE YOU NOT WELL YES
IF LORD ELMWOOD OBSERVED THIS HE DID NOT APPEAR TO OBSERVE IT
BUT HER FRIEND KNOWING WHAT SHE FELT EXCLAIMED OH AS IF FOR HER
BUT WITH FAR DIFFERENT SENSATIONS
THESE EMOTIONS WHICH SHE LABOURED TO SUBDUE PASSED HOWEVER THE BOUNDS OF HER INEFFECTUAL RESISTANCE WHEN AT THE TIME OF RETIRING AFTER DINNER HE SAID TO HER IN A LOW VOICE BUT SUCH AS IT WAS MEANT THE COMPANY SHOULD HEAR DO ME THE FAVOUR MISS MILNER TO CALL AT MY STUDY SOME TIME IN THE EVENING
BUT IT IS VERY NATURAL SAID MRS HORTON
BUT MAKING ONE COURAGEOUS EFFORT OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED
NOR DID HIS PATRON EVER TAKE NOTICE OF HIS OCCASIONAL ABSENCE
HE WAS CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN APPEARANCE AND AT THE FALSEHOODS HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FABRICATE IN HIS EXCUSE
THAT DESPAIR SEIZED HER AT ONCE AND GAINING COURAGE FROM IT SHE CRIED WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR IF I DISOBEY MY FATHER'S COMMANDS ONCE MORE?--HE CANNOT USE ME WORSE
AND WOULD HAVE MADE HIM A PERFECTLY UPRIGHT CHARACTER
THUS IT HAS HAPPENED THAT THE NAME OF FANNY BURNEY HAS MAINTAINED ITS PLACE UPON THE ROLL OF ENGLISH NOVELISTS WHILE THAT OF MRS INCHBALD IS FORGOTTEN
AND THUS ANIMATED BY HIS DANGER HE WAS RESOLVED TO PLUNGE BOLDLY AT ONCE INTO THE DEPTH OF HIS PATRON'S ANGER
AND THE SUBJECT WAS DROPPED
MISS MILNER ALL THIS TIME WAS NOT THINKING UPON THOSE SHE HATED BUT ON THOSE SHE LOVED
SEND MISS MILNER'S MAID HITHER SAID HE IMMEDIATELY THE MAN WITHDREW
I WILL NOT COMPLAIN OF ANY HARDSHIP THY COMMANDS REQUIRE SO THOU DOST NOT URGE MY PEN TO PROSTITUTION
THAT FICTION INFINITELY VARIOUS AS IT IS POSSESSES AT LEAST ONE CHARACTERISTIC COMMON TO THE WHOLE OF IT--A BREADTH OF OUTLOOK UPON LIFE WHICH CAN BE PARALLELED BY NO OTHER BODY OF LITERATURE IN THE WORLD SAVE THAT OF THE ELIZABETHANS
THE UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF MR SANDFORD PUT AN END TO IT
NAY RETURNED HE I SAW TWO CHAIRS WITH SEVERAL SERVANTS COME OUT OF THE DOOR AS I DROVE UP BUT WHAT LIVERY I COULD NOT DISCERN WE HAVE HAD NO CREATURE HERE REPEATED MRS HORTON
AS SOON AS SANDFORD PERCEIVED HIS FRIEND'S UNEASINESS THERE MY LORD CRIED HE EXULTINGLY DID I NOT ALWAYS SAY THE MARRIAGE WAS AN IMPROPER ONE
DORRIFORTH FIXED HIS EYES UPON HER WITH SOME TOKENS OF COMPASSION WHILE SANDFORD SEEMED TO EXULT AND BY HIS REPEATED WELCOMES TO THE BARONET GAVE PROOFS HOW MUCH HE WAS REJOICED TO SEE HIM
CHAPTER VIII
CHAPTER VIII
CHAPTER VIII
SHE HERSELF STROVE WITH HER ANGUISH AND REPLIED BUT WITH A FALTERING VOICE I EXPECTED AS MUCH MY LORD THEN MADAM YOU PERHAPS EXPECT ALL THAT I INTEND IN REGARD TO MYSELF SHE REPLIED I SUPPOSE I DO THEN SAID HE YOU MAY EXPECT THAT IN A FEW DAYS WE SHALL PART I AM PREPARED FOR IT MY LORD SHE ANSWERED AND WHILE SHE SAID SO SUNK UPON A CHAIR
IT SHEWS A PRUDENT FORESIGHT WHICH DOES YOU HONOUR--BUT MY DEAR ARE THERE NO DANGERS IN A SINGLE STATE
HE SUCCEEDED--BUT NOT AS HE WISHED
I CANNOT BUT FEEL MYSELF AS HER ADVERSARY--AS ONE WHO HAS SUPPLANTED HER IN YOUR AFFECTIONS--WHO SUPPLIES HER PLACE WHILE SHE IS EXILED A WANDERER AND AN ORPHAN THE EARL TOOK HIS EYES FROM RUSHBROOK DURING THIS LAST SENTENCE AND CAST THEM ON THE FLOOR
HE NOW AND THEN SIGHED HEAVILY--AND CALLED FOR WINE MUCH OFTENER THAN HE WAS ACCUSTOMED
HE HAS BEHELD THE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS OF AN IMPROPER EDUCATION IN THE DESTINY WHICH ATTENDED THE UNTHINKING MISS MILNER.--ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHAT MAY NOT BE HOPED FROM THAT SCHOOL OF PRUDENCE--THOUGH OF ADVERSITY--IN WHICH MATILDA WAS BRED
LADY MATILDA ADDED HE SUFFER ME TO TAKE YOUR HAND AT PARTING AND LET IT BE A TESTIMONY THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE ME FOR A RELATION SHE PUT OUT HER HAND--WHICH HE KNELT TO RECEIVE BUT DID NOT RAISE IT TO HIS LIPS--HE HELD THE BOON TOO SACRED--AND LOOKING EARNESTLY UPON IT AS IT LAY PALE AND WAN IN HIS HE BREATHED ONE SIGH OVER IT AND WITHDREW
DID NOT YOU SAY THAT SHE WAS GLOOMY NOTHING BUT WHAT I THOUGHT--I WAS GOING TO ADD MR SANDFORD WHEN YOU THINK UNJUSTLY YOU SHOULD NOT EXPRESS YOUR THOUGHTS THEN PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER SPEAK AND IT WERE BETTER YOU DID NOT IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TO GIVE PAIN
IT IS FROM A CAUSE FOR WHICH I OFTEN HATE MYSELF SANDFORD READ ON
ON THE MORNING OF THAT DAY SHE WEPT INCESSANTLY
MISS WOODLEY AFTER A SHORT HESITATION REPLIED--"YOUR GUARDIAN AND SO HE IS CRIED MISS MILNER
WHAT AM I TO DO
WHILE HIS FACE WAS AGITATED WITH SHAME WITH PITY WITH ANGER WITH PATERNAL TENDERNESS
UPON THOSE FEATURES WHERE SARCASM REPROACH AND ANGER DWELT TO THREATEN AND ALARM THE SINNER
CHAPTER II
CHAPTER II
CHAPTER II
THEY WERE IN THE FIELDS ALL THE DAY AS USUAL
WHEN DORRIFORTH WITH AN INSTANTANEOUS IMPULSE RUSHED FORWARD AND STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW IN THE FACE
A GENERAL SILENCE ENSUED FOR NEAR THREE MINUTES
FOR YOUR SAKE I WOULD NOT ENDANGER IT FOR THE UNIVERSE
AND THEN MADE IT WITH A FIRMNESS THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE HONOUR TO THE INFLEXIBILITY OF DORRIFORTH HIMSELF
SHE CURTSIED ASSENT AND FLEW TO TELL MATILDA WHAT HAD OCCURRED
AND YET CAME TO NO EXPLANATION WHY
SANDFORD HAD HOWEVER SAID ONE THING TO MISS WOODLEY WHICH GAVE HER A RAY OF HOPE
BUT TO THE MIND OF LORD ELMWOOD THE MERIT WAS INFINITE
HE GAVE HIM EVERY CARE HE COULD BESTOW AND EVEN MUCH OF HIS PERSONAL ATTENDANCE
THE GROUND IS DAMP AND THE AIR COLD YOU ARE NOT WELL INDEED LADY MATILDA SAID RUSHBROOK GAZING UPON HER WITH THE MOST TENDER RESPECT
BUT LOVERS FEARS ARE LIKE THOSE OF WOMEN OBSTINATE AND NO ARGUMENT COULD PERSUADE EITHER HIM OR MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD NOW VENTURED TO COME TO ELMWOOD HOUSE BUT THAT MATILDA'S PEACE OF MIND MIGHT BE FOR EVER DESTROYED BEFORE SHE WAS SET AT LIBERTY
THESE WORDS OF HIS--"_NOT SEE LORD ELMWOOD IN THE MORNING_"--[NEVER AGAIN TO SEE HIM AFTER THIS EVENING WERE LIKE THE KNELL OF DEATH TO MISS MILNER
CHAPTER III
CHAPTER III
CHAPTER III
AND SOON AFTER AS THEY HEARD THE SERVANTS PASS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK SIX MISS WOODLEY WENT TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
WITHIN A FEW DAYS IN THE HOUSE OF LORD ELMWOOD EVERY THING AND EVERY PERSON WORE A NEW FACE
NOT BECAUSE HE LOVED HER BUT BECAUSE SHE SELDOM DID WRONG--UPON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER HE WAS HALF INCLINED TO REPRIMAND HER
MAY
I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO REQUIRE OF YOU MR DORRIFORTH SAID SHE AND THAT IS YOUR PROMISE YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE WHICH I KNOW IS EVER SACRED THAT YOU WILL NOT MEET MY LORD FREDERICK HE HESITATED
AT THE FIRST GLANCE THE OBJECT WAS PRESENTED AND HE BEHELD--_HIMSELF THE RAPID EMOTION OF VARYING PASSIONS WHICH IMMEDIATELY DARTED OVER HIS FEATURES INFORMED MISS WOODLEY THAT HER SECRET WAS DISCOVERED--SHE HID HER FACE WHILE THE TEARS THAT FELL DOWN TO HER BOSOM CONFIRMED THE TRUTH OF HIS SUGGESTION BEYOND WHAT OATHS COULD HAVE DONE
AND YET SHE VERY PROPERLY THINKS IT HER DUTY AS SHE DOES NOT MEAN TO SECLUDE HERSELF BY ANY VOWS TO THE CONTRARY TO BECOME A WIFE--AND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COUNSEL OF HER FRIENDS WILL BE MARRIED WITHIN A VERY FEW WEEKS MISS FENTON MAY MARRY FROM OBEDIENCE I NEVER WILL YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT LOVE SHALL ALONE INDUCE YOU I DO IF YOU WOULD POINT OUT A SUBJECT UPON WHICH I AM THE LEAST ABLE TO REASON AND ON WHICH MY SENTIMENTS SUCH AS THEY ARE ARE FORMED ONLY FROM THEORY AND EVEN THERE MORE CAUTIONED THAN INSTRUCTED IT IS THE SUBJECT OF LOVE
YOU DISAPPROVE MY CONDUCT IT SEEMS SAID LORD ELMWOOD AND IN THAT YOU ARE BUT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD--AND YET AMONG ALL MY ACQUAINTANCE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS DARED TO INSULT ME WITH YOUR OPINION
OFTEN WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD AND A SIGH WOULD HE SAY NO
MATILDA WAS MOVED BUT SHE POSSESSED TOO MUCH OF THE MANLY RESENTMENT OF HER FATHER TO DISCOVER WHAT SHE FELT FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES
IN WHICH LAMENTATION SANDFORD NOW FORGETTING HIS AFFRONT JOINED WITH THE HEARTIEST CONCURRENCE ADDING YOU SIR HAVING NOW OTHER CARES TO EMPLOY YOUR THOUGHTS OUGHT TO INSIST UPON HER MARRYING OR RETIRING INTO THE COUNTRY SHE RETURNED HOME JUST AS THIS CONVERSATION WAS FINISHED AND SANDFORD THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED RANG FOR HIS CANDLE TO RETIRE
I'LL GO BEFORE AND PREPARE HIM FOR YOUR RECEPTION--YOU SHALL NOT SURPRISE HIM--AND I WILL LET HIM KNOW IT IS BY MR SANDFORD'S INVITATION YOU ARE COMING SHE LISTENED WITH A SMILE TO THIS PROPOSAL YET OBJECTED TO THE INDELICACY OF HER WISHING TO SEE HIM AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HIS LEAVE--BUT AS MISS WOODLEY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS INCLINED TO INFRINGE THIS DELICACY OF WHICH SHE HAD SO PROPER A SENSE SHE EASILY PERSUADED HER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST SUSPICIOUS PERSON AND LORD ELMWOOD WAS FAR FROM SUCH A CHARACTER TO SUPPOSE THAT THE PAYING HIM A VISIT AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME COULD BE WITH THE MOST DISTANT IDEA OF REGAINING HIS HEART OR OF ALTERING ONE RESOLUTION HE HAD TAKEN
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS STORY HER FATHER IS DESCRIBED IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE WITH ALL HIS CARES FIXED UPON HER HIS ONLY CHILD--HOW VAIN THESE CARES
AND AS USUAL AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE STEWARD WENT INTO HIS APARTMENT WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS NOTICE
EVEN THAT HUMBLE HOPE WAS SOMETIMES DENIED HIM WHILE SANDFORD SET FORTH THE IMPROPRIETY OF TROUBLING LORD ELMWOOD ON SUCH A SUBJECT AT PRESENT
AND LOOKED WITH THE MOST CURIOUS ATTENTION INTO THOSE BOOKS THAT WERE LAID UPON HIS READING DESK
BUT IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT I MADE HIM THINK UPON HIS DAUGHTER I CANNOT GO TOO OFTEN I DON'T SEE HOW HE CAN DIVIDE THOSE TWO OBJECTS IN HIS MIND REPLIED SANDFORD THEREFORE YOU MUST E'EN VISIT HIM ON AND TAKE YOUR CHANCE WHAT REFLECTIONS YOU MAY CAUSE--BUT BE THEY WHAT THEY WILL TIME WILL STEAL AWAY FROM YOU THAT POWER OF AFFECTING HIM SHE CONCURRED IN THE OPINION AND OCCASIONALLY SHE WALKED INTO LORD ELMWOOD'S APARTMENTS DINED OR TOOK HER COFFEE WITH HIM AS THE ACCIDENT SUITED
THE INTENDED MARRIAGE AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT SHE WAS INDIFFERENT WHETHER IT EVER TOOK PLACE OR NOT
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU BUILD A FOUNDATION FOR JOY UPON THIS SURMISE
HOW HAPPY HOW TRANSPORTING WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT ARRIVAL A FEW MONTHS BEFORE
BALLS PLAYS INCESSANT COMPANY AT LENGTH ROUSED HER GUARDIAN FROM THAT MILDNESS WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TREAT HER
THUS EACH UNDERSTOOD THE OTHER'S LANGUAGE WITHOUT EITHER HAVING UTTERED A WORD
LORD ELMWOOD'S BEHAVIOUR WAS CALCULATED ONLY TO PRODUCE THE LATTER--HE WAS COLD POLITE AND PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
WHEN LOOKING ON THE RING LORD ELMWOOD HAD PUT UPON HER FINGER IN HASTE WHEN HE MARRIED HER SHE PERCEIVED IT WAS A--MOURNING RING
THE RECTITUDE OF HIS OWN HEART WAS A BAR TO THE SUSPICION OF HER'S
FOR IN CASES WHERE THE HEART IS SO IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED AS I BELIEVE SIR EDWARD'S TO BE TASTE OR RATHER REASON HAS NO POWER TO ACT YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MR DORRIFORTH
AND REPEATED AS NEARLY AS HE COULD REMEMBER THE WHOLE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN LORD ELMWOOD AND HIMSELF
AND THAT WAS AN ENTIRE SEPARATION FROM HER GUARDIAN
HE DREADED THE REPULSES HIS ADMONITIONS MIGHT POSSIBLY MEET
AND BEING OF NO IMPORTANCE IN ANY THING ELSE THE MANAGER OF COURSE NOW WHOLLY DISCHARGED HIM--AND THUS ACTUALLY REDUCING HIM TO THE WANT OF A PIECE OF BREAD IN A SHORT TIME HE BECAME A PROPER FIGURE FOR THE PART AGAIN WELCOME THEN THOU ALL-POWERFUL PRINCIPLE NECESSITY
AND WHAT IS THAT SAID MATILDA WITH INDIFFERENCE
AND RUSHBROOK TURNED HIS HORSE AND RODE BACK WITH SANDFORD
BUT WITHOUT ENQUIRING WHAT SHE PROPOSED SHE NEVER SAW HIM WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY ENDEAVOURING TO LOOK MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN SHE WOULD HAVE DESIRED BEFORE ANY OTHER PERSON
EDUCATION IS CALLED SECOND NATURE
BESIDES HOW CAN YOU INDULGE A DISPOSITION THUS UNPITYING
BUT AS IT HAS BEEN MY FATE TO BE USED ILL AND SEVERED FROM ALL THOSE PERSONS TO WHOM MY SOUL HAS BEEN MOST ATTACHED
BUT AS YOUR HEART IS STILL YOUR OWN AND HE SEEMED REJOICED TO FIND IT WAS PERMIT ME TO WARN YOU HOW YOU PART WITH A THING SO PRECIOUS--THE DANGERS THE SORROWS YOU HAZARD IN BESTOWING IT ARE GREATER THAN YOU MAY BE AWARE OF
AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT A MAN TO BE SUSPECTED OF SUBMITTING TO THE EXCESS OF ANY PASSION THUS DID MISS WOODLEY ARGUE LEST HER FRIEND SHOULD BE MISLED BY HER WISHES
AND I HAVE NOT FROM HENCEFORWARD A WISH TO BE REGARDED BY YOU IN ANY OTHER RESPECT THAN AS ONE WHO WISHES YOU WELL THAT YOU EVER BEHELD ME IN THE ENDEARING QUALITY OF A DESTINED AND AN AFFECTIONATE HUSBAND SUCH AS I WOULD HAVE PROVED WAS A DECEPTION UPON MY HOPES
MR SANDFORD ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING OF LEARNING AND A COMPLETE CASUIST YET ALL THE FAULTS HE HIMSELF COMMITTED WERE ENTIRELY--FOR WANT OF KNOWING BETTER
NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR REAL VALUE
I LOVE LADY MATILDA--OR PERHAPS UNACQUAINTED WITH LOVE WHAT I FEEL MAY BE ONLY PITY--AND IF SO PITY IS THE MOST PLEASING PASSION THAT EVER POSSESSED A HUMAN HEART AND I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT FOR ALL HER FATHER'S ESTATES PITY THEN GIVES RISE TO VERY DIFFERENT SENSATIONS--FOR I PITY YOU AND THAT SENSATION I WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE FOR APPROBATION IF YOU REALLY FEEL COMPASSION FOR ME AND I BELIEVE YOU DO CONTRIVE SOME MEANS BY YOUR ANSWERS TO LORD ELMWOOD TO PACIFY HIM WITHOUT INVOLVING ME IN RUIN
NO I WISH YOU WELL;--I WISH YOU HEALTH AND HAPPINESS NO PRAYERS FOR BLESSINGS ON HER NOT EVEN THE WORD FAREWELL ESCAPED HIS LIPS--PERHAPS TO HAVE ATTEMPTED ANY OF THESE MIGHT HAVE CHOAKED HIS UTTERANCE
HAPPY AS MISS MILNER FOUND HERSELF IN HIS COMPANY SHE SAW HIM LEAVE THE ROOM WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION BECAUSE HER HEART WAS IMPATIENT TO GIVE A LOOSE TO ITS HOPES ON THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY
OR OF WEARING FINE CLOATHS
ONCE MORE THEN BOWING TO ITS EMPIRE I SUBMIT TO THE TASK IT ENJOINS
BUT SHE UTTERED NOT A WORD
THIS CONSIDERATION WAS SO WEIGHTY IT RESIGNED RUSHBROOK TO THE SUSPENSE HE WAS COMPELLED TO ENDURE TILL THE MORNING
I PROTEST YOU TERRIFY ME FOR THIS INCONSISTENCY IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF MISS MILNER APPEARED AS IF HER SENSES HAD BEEN DERANGED
YOU AND MR SANDFORD MUST FINISH YOUR DISPUTE IN THE MORNING DISPUTE MADAM SAID SANDFORD I NEVER DISPUTED WITH ANY ONE BENEATH A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY IN MY LIFE
MISS MILNER CONTINUED HER POSITION AND SAID NOTHING--BUT AT THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH WHICH HER FINGERS DID NOT ENTIRELY COVER THERE WERE DISCOVERABLE A THOUSAND DIMPLED GRACES LIKE SMALL CONVULSIVE FIBRES WHICH A RESTRAINED SMILE UPON LORD ELMWOOD'S RETURN HAD SENT THERE
SHALL I GO AND REPOSE MY DISTURBED MIND ON SANDFORD
HE VISITED DORRIFORTH ON THE EVENING OF HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH LORD FREDERICK AND THE NEXT MORNING BREAKFASTED WITH HIM IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
AND AS HE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAPRICIOUS OR INCONSTANT IN HIS TEMPER THEY WERE RESOLUTIONS WHICH NO PROBABLE EVENT COULD SHAKE
NEAR THREE WEEKS SHE HAD NOT NOW PAID A VISIT TO LORD ELMWOOD AND THOUGH TO HERSELF EVERY VISIT WAS A PAIN YET AS MATILDA TOOK A DELIGHT IN HEARING OF HER FATHER WHAT HE SAID WHAT HE DID WHAT HIS ATTENTION SEEMED MOST EMPLOYED ON AND A THOUSAND OTHER CIRCUMSTANTIAL INFORMATIONS IN WHICH SANDFORD WOULD SCORN TO BE HALF SO PARTICULAR IT WAS A DEPRIVATION TO HER THAT MISS WOODLEY DID NOT GO OFTENER
NO SHE HAD BEFORE THEM DIVULGED NOTHING OF WHICH SHE WAS ASHAMED
MISS MILNER HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A FAMILY WHO HAD IMBIBED THOSE OPINIONS THAT SHE WAS CONVINCED OF THEIR EXISTENCE
LIGHT ME TO MY BED-CHAMBER INSTANTLY SAID SHE TO HER MAID WHO WAITED IN THE HALL TO RECEIVE HER
YES MY LORD I AM GLAD OF IT--HE WILL SEE THAT EVERY THING SHE DESIRED IS DONE--SANDFORD IS A GOOD MAN AND WOULD BE A FRIEND TO EVERY BODY HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN INDEED MY LORD THERE WAS NOW A SILENCE.----MR GIFFARD THEN BOWING SAID HAS YOUR LORDSHIP ANY FURTHER COMMANDS WRITE TO SANDFORD SAID LORD ELMWOOD HESITATING AS HE SPOKE AND TELL HIM TO HAVE EVERY THING PERFORMED AS SHE DESIRED
MISS WOODLEY TOO SMILED AT THE PROSPECT BEFORE HER--SHE ESTEEMED LORD ELMWOOD BEYOND ANY MORTAL LIVING--SHE WAS PROUD TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD SAID IN HER PRAISE AND OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING ONCE AGAIN IN HIS COMPANY
FOR MISS WOODLEY BY REPLYING FIRST HAD GIVEN HER TIME TO COLLECT HERSELF
AND RAISING HIS VOICE HE EXCLAIMED IN A RAGE LEAVE MY HOUSE SIR
AND YET YOU EVEN YOU MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY WILL NOT PITY ME MISS WOODLEY PRESSED HER CLOSELY IN HER ARMS AND VOWED THAT WHILE SHE WAS UNHAPPY FROM WHATEVER CAUSE SHE STILL WOULD PITY HER GO TO MR DORRIFORTH THEN AND PREVENT HIM FROM IMPOSING UPON LORD FREDERICK BUT THAT IMPOSITION IS THE ONLY MEANS OF PREVENTING THE DUEL REPLIED MISS WOODLEY
ONE CHILD ONLY WAS THE RESULT OF THEIR UNION THE CHILD WHOSE FUTURE WELFARE NOW OCCUPIED THE ANXIOUS THOUGHTS OF HER EXPIRING FATHER
WITH LESS REGRET I CAN PART FROM YOU THAN IF THIS WERE MY FIRST TRIAL THERE WAS A TRUTH AND A PATHETIC SOUND IN THE UTTERANCE OF THESE WORDS THAT STRUCK RUSHBROOK TO THE HEART--AND HE BEHELD HIMSELF AS A BARBARIAN WHO HAD TREATED HIS BENEVOLENT AND ONLY FRIEND WITH INSUFFERABLE LIBERTY
IN SHORT I'LL VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER MY LORD ELMWOOD IS MARRIED WITHIN A YEAR MISS MILNER WHO LISTENED WITH ATTENTION FEARED SHE WAS IN A DREAM OR DECEIVED BY THE PRETENDED KNOWLEDGE OF MR FLEETMOND WHO MIGHT KNOW NOTHING--YET ALL THAT HE HAD SAID WAS VERY PROBABLE
FOR THE MOMENT SHE CARRIED A MORSEL TO HER LIPS SHE LAID IT ON HER PLATE AGAIN AND TURNED PALER FROM THE VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FORCE HER APPETITE
THOUGH STILL BEAUTIFUL BEYOND DESCRIPTION SHE DOES NOT LOOK EVEN IN PERSON THE SAME
FOR IT IS THAT WHICH I SHALL NEXT INSIST UPON AND TO WHICH YOU CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION SHE REPLIED I HAD RATHER IT SHOULD CONTINUE ON WHAT ACCOUNT CRIED DORRIFORTH
IF SHE IS THE CAUSE OF YOUR DISOBEDIENCE BE ASSURED I SHALL NOT MENTION IT FOR I AM FORBID TO NAME HER AND SURELY AS THAT IS THE CASE I NEED NOT FEAR TO SPEAK PLAINLY TO YOU
I WAS AFRAID I INTRUDED UPON MISS WOODLEY AND A STRANGER YOU DO NOT THEN CONSIDER ME AS A STRANGER LADY MATILDA
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED SITS SANDFORD--HIS HAIR GROWN WHITE--HIS FACE WRINKLED WITH AGE--HIS HEART THE SAME AS EVER.--THE REPROVER THE ENEMY OF THE VAIN THE IDLE AND THE WICKED
IT IS VERY WELL SIR RETURNED HE VEXED TO THE HEART--YET AGAIN WISHING TO SOOTH HIM YOU CERTAINLY MR SANDFORD KNOW WHAT IS FOR THE BEST--YET I ENTREAT YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE NOBLEMAN YOU NAMED I KNOW WHAT IS FOR THE BEST REPLIED SANDFORD AND I WON'T RUSHBROOK BOWED AND IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM
YET IN HER OWN MIND SHE SCARCE HARBOURED A DOUBT THAT ANY THING WOULD THWART THEM
I BEG YOUR PARDON MY LORD SAID LORD ELMWOOD I PROTEST I DID NOT KNOW YOU I OUGHT TO ENTREAT YOUR LORDSHIP'S PARDON RETURNED LORD FREDERICK FOR THIS INTRUSION WHICH AN ACCIDENT ALONE HAS OCCASIONED
BEFORE HE COULD RETURN AN ANSWER SANDFORD CRIED AND WHAT OBJECTION TO A FOREIGNER FOR A WIFE
HE CONSTANTLY REPROVED FAULTS IN OTHERS AND HE WAS MOST ASSUREDLY TOO GOOD A MAN NOT TO HAVE CORRECTED AND AMENDED HIS OWN HAD THEY BEEN KNOWN TO HIM--BUT THEY WERE NOT
MRS HORTON INDEED RETIRED TO HER CHAMBER AT TWO AND LEFT THE GENTLEMEN TO A MORE SERIOUS DISCOURSE
IT HAS BEEN THE DESTINY OF THE WRITER OF THIS STORY TO BE OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT HER LIFE IN WHAT HAS THE LEAST SUITED EITHER HER INCLINATION OR CAPACITY--WITH AN INVINCIBLE IMPEDIMENT IN HER SPEECH IT WAS HER LOT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS TO GAIN A SUBSISTENCE BY PUBLIC SPEAKING--AND WITH THE UTMOST DETESTATION TO THE FATIGUE OF INVENTING A CONSTITUTION SUFFERING UNDER A SEDENTARY LIFE AND AN EDUCATION CONFINED TO THE NARROW BOUNDARIES PRESCRIBED HER SEX IT HAS BEEN HER FATE TO DEVOTE A TEDIOUS SEVEN YEARS TO THE UNREMITTING LABOUR OF LITERARY PRODUCTIONS--WHILST A TASTE FOR AUTHORS OF THE FIRST RANK HAS BEEN AN ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT FORBIDDING HER ONE MOMENT OF THOSE SELF-APPROVING REFLECTIONS WHICH ARE ASSUREDLY DUE TO THE INDUSTRIOUS
YET WITH ALL THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO SANDFORD AND PUT FORTH HIS HAND TO TAKE HIS SANDFORD WITH EVIDENT RELUCTANCE GAVE IT TO HIM
AND THOUGH SHE DID NOT FEEL THE LEAST PARTICLE OF LOVE IN RETURN SHE FELT GRATITUDE IN PROPORTION TO THE INSENSIBILITY WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TREATED BY HER GUARDIAN
SHE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER HER GUARDIAN WAS COME TO SEE HER BUT SHE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO ASK BEFORE HER FRIEND
KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH MISS MILNER THE GAY THE VAIN THE DISSIPATED THE HAUGHTY MISS MILNER SUNK UNDERNEATH THIS KINDNESS AND WEPT WITH A GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE WHICH DID NOT GIVE MORE SURPRISE THAN IT GAVE JOY TO DORRIFORTH
AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP-TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
SHE WISHED TO SPEAK TO LORD ELMWOOD UPON THE SUBJECT AND UNKNOWN TO HER PLEAD HER EXCUSE
COULD HE THEN RETREAT?--HE WISHED HE COULD
MISS WOODLEY STOOD FOR SOME TIME TO CONSIDER WHICH WAY SHE WAS TO GO
THEY INTERCHANGED FORGIVENESS
BUT I'LL NOT STAY TO BE DRIVEN HENCE--FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOUR FATHER WILL SUFFER ANY FRIEND OF YOURS TO CONTINUE HERE AFTER THIS DISOBEDIENCE
AND PUTTING ON AN AIR OF SURLY IMPORTANCE DESIRED,--IF HE HAD ANY BUSINESS WITH HIM THAT HE WOULD CALL IN THE MORNING
BUT THE DELIVERY MADE THEM PASS FOR WIT AS GRACE IN AN ILL-PROPORTIONED FIGURE WILL OFTEN MAKE IT PASS FOR SYMMETRY
SAVE ME FROM PROVOKING HIM PERHAPS TO CURSE ME AND HERE SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TOGETHER WITH THE MOST FERVENT PETITION IN THE DREAD OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
THAT HAS UNDONE HER--I WILL NOT CALL HER YOURS
HIS VISIT WAS TO HIS COUSIN MR DORRIFORTH BUT AS ALL CEREMONIOUS VISITS WERE ALIKE RECEIVED BY DORRIFORTH MISS MILNER AND MRS HORTON'S FAMILY IN ONE COMMON APARTMENT LORD ELMWOOD WAS USHERED INTO THIS AND OF COURSE DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION TO A DIFFERENT SUBJECT
NOR HAD THE PRESENT EARL BEEN NEAR THE PLACE WHERE SHE RESIDED SINCE THE WEEK IN WHICH HER LOVER DIED
I TELL YOU AGAIN THAT NO FAULT CAN BE FOUND WITH HER PERSON BUT IF HER MIND IS DEFECTIVE"--EXCLAIMED DORRIFORTH WITH A SIGH THAT MAY BE IMPROVED AS WELL AS THE PERSON CRIED MISS WOODLEY
BUT HOW ARE YOU TO KNOW HE HAS THESE KIND THOUGHTS IF HE GIVES YOU NO PROOF OF THEM NO MR SANDFORD
DO YOU NOT WISH ME HAPPY YES SHE EXCLAIMED
HOW CAN I JUDGE IF SHE WILL NOT CONFIDE IN ME BUT THUS FOR EVER DECEIVE ME SHE LEANED PALE AS DEATH ON THE SHOULDER OF MISS WOODLEY HER EYE FIXED WITH APPARENT INSENSIBILITY TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WHILE HE CONTINUED HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS IF I KNEW--IF I COULD CONCEIVE THE MEANS HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY OWN HAPPINESS TO HERS MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A SMILE PERHAPS I MAY CALL UPON YOU HEREAFTER TO FULFIL YOUR WORD HE WAS TOTALLY IGNORANT WHAT SHE MEANT NOR HAD HE LEISURE FROM THE CONFUSION OF HIS THOUGHTS TO REFLECT UPON HER MEANING
THEN HOW MY LORD CAN YOU ENCOURAGE ME TO SPEAK ON WHEN THAT WHICH I PERHAPS WOULD SAY MIGHT OFFEND YOU TO HEAR TO WHAT AND WHITHER ARE YOU CHANGING OUR SUBJECT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD
THE MAID ENTERED
THE WALKS WERE MELANCHOLY THE COMPANY INSIPID THE BALL-ROOM FATIGUING--FOR SHE HAD LEFT BEHIND ALL THAT COULD CHARM OR PLEASE HER
HE THEN WITH A DIFFIDENCE NOT AFFECTED BUT MOST POWERFULLY FELT PULLED OFF HIS HAT
NOR COULD ANY THING BUT THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS OPPONENT WAS SLAIN HAVE AT LAST TORN HIM FROM THE FIELD THOUGH HE HIMSELF WAS DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
BECAUSE HE LOVES ME TOO WELL--BECAUSE HIS OWN HAPPINESS IS TOO DEAR TO HIM I BELIEVE HE LOVES YOU REPLIED MISS WOODLEY AND YET THERE IS A DOUBT IF THERE SHALL BE NO LONGER A DOUBT CRIED MISS MILNER I'LL PUT HIM TO THE PROOF FOR SHAME MY DEAR
IF YOU CHUSE IN EVERY CONVERSATION WE HAVE TOGETHER THOUGH THE MOST REMOTE FROM SUCH A SUBJECT TO THINK OF MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST EITHER BANISH YOUR THOUGHTS OR CONCEAL THEM--NOR BY ONE SIGN ONE ITEM REMIND ME OF HER YOUR DAUGHTER DID YOU CALL HER
THEN INDEED YOU DID
IF WE WERE TO INQUIRE HOW IT HAS HAPPENED THAT THE TRUE VALUE OF MRS INCHBALD'S ACHIEVEMENT HAS PASSED OUT OF GENERAL RECOGNITION PERHAPS THE ANSWER TO OUR QUESTION WOULD BE FOUND TO LIE IN THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY WITH WHICH THE MASS OF READERS DETECT AND APPRECIATE MERE QUALITY IN LITERATURE
AS HER SITUATION BECAME HOWEVER LESS ALARMING HER GUARDIAN'S PITY AND AFFRIGHT BEGAN TO TAKE THE COLOUR OF RESENTMENT
NOR DID I SEE HIM AFTER TILL HE WAS IN HIS CARRIAGE
LORD ELMWOOD WAS EXTREMELY AFFECTED AT HIS INDISPOSITION
CERTAINLY RETURNED HE HAD YOU INVITED ME THEN FROM THIS DAY I GIVE YOU A GENERAL INVITATION
IN THE EXERCISE OF THE ARTS INDUSTRY SCARCE BEARS THE NAME OF MERIT
BUT THOSE PRETENSIONS WERE FOUNDED ON THE VAGUE HOPES OF A LOVER ONLY
I MUST ATONE FOR THIS OUTRAGE IN WHATEVER MANNER HE MAY CHOOSE
LEFT THE THEATRE AND DETERMINED THEMSELVES TO REPEAT THIS TILL THEY HAVE ANOTHER COMPANY THESE ADVENTURES WERE DIVERSIFIED BY A JOURNEY TO PARIS UNDERTAKEN IN THE HOPE THAT MR INCHBALD WHO FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT ENGAGEMENTS MIGHT PICK UP A LIVELIHOOD AS A PAINTER OF MINIATURES
I NOW FEEL AS THE REALITY APPROACHES THAT TO BE ADMITTED HERE IS KINDNESS ENOUGH--I DO NOT ASK FOR MORE--I AM NOW CONVINCED FROM WHAT THIS TRIAL MAKES ME FEEL THAT TO SEE MY FATHER WOULD OCCASION EMOTIONS I COULD NOT SURVIVE THE NEXT MORNING GAVE TO MATILDA MORE OBJECTS OF ADMIRATION AND WONDER AS SHE WALKED OVER THE EXTENSIVE GARDENS GROVES AND OTHER PLEASURE GROUNDS BELONGING TO THE HOUSE
SHE LOOKED AT HIM EARNESTLY AS IF TO IMPLY WHAT NOW MY LORD HE ONLY ANSWERED WITH A BOW WHICH EXPRESSED

THIS PLAN HAVING BEEN PROPERLY REGULATED THE NECESSARY LETTER WAS SENT TO BATH AND MISS WOODLEY WAITED WITH PATIENCE BUT WITH A WATCHFUL GUARD UPON THE CONDUCT OF HER FRIEND TILL THE ANSWER SHOULD ARRIVE
AND NOT DARING TO HOPE FOR THE CONSUMMATION OF HIS WISHES BY ANY OTHER MEANS HE SUFFERED HIMSELF TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT AS HIS ONLY RESOURCE
YOU SHALL NOT DARE ME TO DO YOU AN INJURY
WHICH INTIMIDATES AND STRIKES ME DUMB
DISCONCERTED AND MUCH AFFECTED AT HIS SIGHT THEIR FORMER INTIMACY COMING TO HER MIND WITH THE MANY YEARS AND MANY SAD OCCURRENCES PASSED SINCE SHE LAST SAW HIM ALL HER INTENTIONS ALL HER MEDITATED PLANS HOW TO CONDUCT HERSELF ON SUCH AN OCCASION GAVE WAY TO A SUDDEN SHOCK--AND TO MAKE THE MEETING YET MORE DISTRESSING HER VERY FRIGHT SHE KNEW WOULD SERVE TO RECALL MORE POWERFULLY TO HIS MIND THE SUBJECT SHE MOST WISHED HIM TO FORGET
SHE CAME YESTERDAY MORNING RETURNED SANDFORD AND IS AT HER BROTHER'S IN ORMOND-STREET
WHEN MRS HILLGRAVE HAD BEEN SEATED A FEW MINUTES MRS HORTON WHO LOVED INFORMATION EQUALLY WITH THE MOST INQUISITIVE OF HER SEX ASKED THE NEW VISITOR--"IF SHE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO KNOW WHY AT THE MENTION OF MISS MILNER SHE HAD SEEMED SO MUCH AFFECTED THIS QUESTION EXCITING THE FEARS OF DORRIFORTH HE TURNED ANXIOUSLY ROUND ATTENTIVE TO THE REPLY
THIS REFINED TENDERNESS GAVE POOR MISS MILNER THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE AGONY OF HEARING THAT HER FATHER WAS NO MORE EVEN BEFORE SHE WAS TOLD HE WAS NOT IN HEALTH
I BEG PARDON MADAM FOR THIS LONG INTRUSION AND AM AND EVER WILL BE WHILE YOU AND MY LORD'S DAUGHTER ARE SO YOUR AFFLICTED HUMBLE SERVANT ROBERT GIFFARD
SHE IS A CREATURE OF FIERY WILL OF HIGH BEARING OF NOBLE DISPOSITION
YET THE STUDIOUS MANNER WITH WHICH THESE LINES WERE DICTATED THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT AND THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SEEN AND REGARDED BY LADY MATILDA RENDERED THE TASK AN ANXIETY SO PLEASING THAT HE COULD HAVE WISHED IT MIGHT HAVE LASTED FOR A YEAR
THAT WOULD BE HIGHLY UNWORTHY OF HER BUT SOMETIMES WOMEN DO FRET AT SUCH THINGS REPLIED MRS HORTON INNOCENTLY
AND SHE BEGAN BEFORE HER FATHER'S ARRIVAL TO SECLUDE HERSELF IN THE APARTMENTS ALLOTTED FOR HER DURING THE TIME OF HIS STAY
IN SPITE OF HER PRIDE THE DAUGHTER OF LORD ELMWOOD EVEN WEPT AT THE INSULT SHE HAD RECEIVED ON THIS INSIGNIFICANT OCCASION
IT IS UNLUCKY--I AM SORRY FOR IT--BUT I'LL BE AT HOME EARLY IN THE EVENING STAINED WITH HUMAN BLOOD CRIED SANDFORD OR YOURSELF A CORPSE THE LADIES LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS!--MISS MILNER ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND THREW HERSELF AT HER GUARDIAN'S FEET
MISS MILNER DID NOT LIKE MR SANDFORD
THEN DESIRE HER MAID TO CALL HER SAID MRS HORTON TO MISS WOODLEY
SHE COMPLAINED TO MISS WOODLEY WHO ADVISED HER TO HAVE PATIENCE
AS SOON AS SHE BECAME PERFECTLY RECOLLECTED HER FIRST CARE KNOWING THE FRAILTY OF HER HEART WAS TO ENQUIRE WHAT SHE HAD UTTERED WHILE DELIRIOUS
I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED MRS HILLGRAVE
I AM NOT SURE SHE IS RETURNED MRS HORTON
WHERE IS LORD ELMWOOD SAID MISS MILNER--"HE MUST NOT SEE ME NO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE CRIED MISS WOODLEY I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM SEE YOU IN SUCH A DISGUISE FOR THE UNIVERSE AND YET RETURNED THE OTHER WITH A SIGH WHY AM I THEN THUS PLEASED WITH MY DRESS
AND YOU CONTINUED SHE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO CHURCH-MUSIC WILL BE MORE THAN ANY ONE ENCHANTED WITH HEARING THE SOFTER MUSIC OF LOVE WHAT RAVISHING PLEASURES YOU ARE PREPARING FOR ME RETURNED HE--"I KNOW NOT WHETHER MY WEAK SENSES WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM SHE HAD HER EYES UPON HIM WHEN HE SPOKE THIS AND SHE DISCOVERED IN HIS THAT WERE FIXED UPON HER A SENSIBILITY UNEXPECTED--A KIND OF FASCINATION WHICH ENTICED HER TO LOOK ON WHILE HER EYELIDS FELL INVOLUNTARILY BEFORE ITS MIGHTY FORCE AND A THOUSAND BLUSHES CROWDED OVER HER FACE
SHE FOLLOWED UP HER FARCE WITH A SERIES OF PLAYS EITHER ORIGINAL OR ADAPTED WHICH ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION WERE WELL RECEIVED SO THAT SHE WAS SOON ABLE TO RETIRE FROM THE STAGE WITH A COMFORTABLE COMPETENCE
I AM SELDOM NOW AT ELMWOOD CASTLE
THIS UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT THE CASE
AND WITH THIS AND THE FOLLOWING REFLECTION HE RECONCILED--AS MOST BAD MEN CAN--WHAT HE HAD DONE NOT ONLY TO THE LAWS OF HUMANITY BUT TO THE LAWS OF HONOUR
SHE TOLD HER SHE HAD BEEN SHEWN THE GREATEST VARIETY OF BEAUTIFUL AND BECOMING DRESSES SHE HAD EVER BEHELD
AND TO CONVINCE YOU IN HOW HIGH AN ESTIMATION I HOLD HER IN PARTICULAR MY WHOLE FORTUNE IS AT HER COMMAND YOUR ENTIRE ABSENCE FROM THIS HOUSE MY LORD SHE WOULD CONSIDER AS A MUCH GREATER MARK OF YOUR RESPECT A LONG CONVERSATION AS UNINTERESTING AS THIS ENSUED
SHE MADE THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF DORRIFORTH
AND HER DIARY FOR DECEMBER 17 1794 HAS THIS ENTRY:--"DR GISBORNE DRANK TEA HERE AND STAID VERY LATE
BUT WHAT IS THE SUBJECT ON WHICH HE HAS REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH YOUR DESIRES MATRIMONY--HAVE NOT I TOLD YOU NOT A WORD I WISH HIM TO MARRY THAT I MAY THEN CONCLUDE THE DEEDS IN RESPECT TO MY ESTATE,--AND THE ONLY CHILD OF SIR WILLIAM WINTERTON A RICH HEIRESS WAS THE WIFE I MEANT TO PROPOSE
LORD ELMWOOD NOW FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIM WITH A SULLEN CONTEMPT AND RISING FROM HIS CHAIR SAID RUSHBROOK IF YOU HAVE BEEN SO INCONSIDERATE AS TO GIVE AWAY YOUR HEART TELL ME SO AT ONCE AND TELL ME THE OBJECT RUSHBROOK SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
CLOSE BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE ONE HAND SUPPORTING HER HEAD THE OTHER WIPING FROM HER FACE THE COLD DEW OF DEATH BEHOLD LADY ELMWOOD'S DAUGHTER--LORD ELMWOOD'S DAUGHTER TOO--YET HE FAR AWAY NEGLIGENT OF WHAT EITHER SUFFERS
BUT THEN I DID NOT ENGAGE HIM TO THIS BY THE SMALLEST RAY OF HOPE
NO MY LORD NOR WOULD I WERE I IN YOUR SITUATION
THIS RIGID MONITOR AND FRIEND WAS A MR SANDFORD BRED A JESUIT IN THE SAME COLLEGE AT WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD SINCE BEEN EDUCATED BUT BEFORE HIS TIME THE ORDER WAS COMPELLED TO TAKE ANOTHER NAME
THIS WAS THE CASE AT PRESENT--HIS WORDS WOUNDED HER TO THE HEART BUT SHE HAD NOT THE ASPERITY TO REPLY TO THEM AS SHE THOUGHT THEY MERITED AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS
AND HE RESOLVED THOUGH RELUCTANTLY TO APPLY TO HER FATHER FOR HIS CONSENT TO THEIR UNION
THE SUBJECT OF THE MASQUERADE WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP NOR INDEED WAS IT ONCE IN HIS THOUGHTS
DORRIFORTH IS THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW WHO UNITING THE MORAL VIRTUES TO THOSE OF RELIGION AND PIOUS FAITH TO NATIVE HONOUR WILL PROTECT WITHOUT CONTROLLING INSTRUCT WITHOUT TYRANNIZING COMFORT WITHOUT FLATTERING
DID LORD FREDERICK TELL YOU HE SHOULD BE DOWN SANDFORD ASKED OF DORRIFORTH
I SUFFER MORE THAN SHE DOES
BUT IT IS ONE SO LITTLE TO THE SATISFACTION OF MOST READERS THAT THE DEGREES OF MISCONDUCT BY WHICH LADY ELMWOOD FELL ARE NOT MEANT TO BE RELATED HERE
SANDFORD STARED WITH BOTH HIS EYES FULL UPON HIM
AND THOSE AFFECTIONS PAINTED THE TIME SO IRKSOME THAT WAS PAST
BY ALL THE ROUND OF GREAT OR TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHALL BE RELATED
IN YORKSHIRE WE FIND THE INCHBALDS THE SIDDONSES AND KEMBLE RETIRING TO THE MOORS IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS TO PLAY BLINDMAN'S BUFF OR PUSS IN THE CORNER
YOUR LORDSHIP CONTINUED SANDFORD WAS MISTAKEN IN SUPPOSING THAT LADY ELMWOOD LEFT A WILL SHE LEFT NONE NO WILL
MATILDA AND MISS WOODLEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER BUT DID NOT DINE
A RESEMBLANCE TO THE PORTRAIT SHE HAD BEEN SHOWN OF HIM
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THIS ABRUPT PROPOSAL WITH UNEASINESS MISS MILNER TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT IMMEDIATELY CONSENTED
AND I WAS GOING TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON THE CHANGE
TO PREVENT THE CAUSE OF HIS ABSENCE BEING SUSPECTED BY LORD ELMWOOD HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED HIS GROOM ORDERED HIS HORSE AND GIVING THOSE SERVANTS CONCERNED A STRICT CHARGE OF SECRECY WITH SOME FRIVOLOUS PRETENCE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS NOT BEING PRESENT AT BREAKFAST RESOLVING TO BE BACK BY DINNER HE SET OFF THAT NIGHT AND ARRIVED AT AN INN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE FARM AT BREAK OF DAY
SHE RECLINED UPON A SOFA THERE AND THOUGH LEFT ALONE WITH THAT FRIEND A SILENCE FOLLOWED OF HALF AN HOUR
BRUSHED EVERY LAMP OUT WITH THEIR HATS
I DO NOT WANT TO READ THE LETTER SAID MISS WOODLEY
YOU MAY LAUGH AT THESE SENTIMENTS AS ROMANTIC MR SANDFORD BUT IF THEY ARE TO ME THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS NATURAL BUT OF WHAT SERVICE ARE THEY TO BE EITHER TO HER OR TO YOURSELF TO ME THEY ARE PAINFUL AND TO HER WOULD BE BUT IMPERTINENT WERE SHE TO KNOW THEM I SHAN'T INFORM HER OF THEM SO DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO CAUTION ME AGAINST IT I WAS NOT GOING--YOU KNOW I WAS NOT--BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT FROM NO ONE SO WELL AS FROM YOU COULD SHE BE TOLD MY SENTIMENTS WITHOUT THE DANGER OF RECEIVING OFFENCE AND WHAT IMPRESSION DO YOU WISH TO GIVE HER FROM HER BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE HAS ONE SINCERE FRIEND
OF WHICH SHE WAS SO SENSIBLE THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS IT MADE HER WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE INTELLIGENCE
AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST--AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE THE ROOM--SHE FOLLOWED HIM AND CRIED BUT MY LORD HOW SHALL I SEE AGAIN THE UNHAPPY OBJECT OF MY TREACHERY SEE HER REPLIED HE AS ONE TO WHOM YOU MEANT NO INJURY AND TO WHOM YOU HAVE DONE NONE BUT SHE WOULD ACCOUNT IT AN INJURY WE ARE NOT JUDGES OF WHAT BELONGS TO OURSELVES HE REPLIED--"I AM TRANSPORTED AT THE TIDINGS YOU HAVE REVEALED AND YET PERHAPS I HAD BETTER NEVER HAVE HEARD THEM MISS WOODLEY WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING FARTHER BUT AS IF INCAPABLE OF ATTENDING TO HER HE HASTENED OUT OF THE ROOM
HOW MANY SERVANTS LIVE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND ARE FED WITH PLENTY WHILE I STARVE IN A FOREIGN LAND I DO NOT ASK A PARENT'S FESTIVE REJOICING AT HER APPROACH--I DO NOT EVEN ASK HER FATHER TO BEHOLD HER
LORD ELMWOOD DID NOT DROP ONE WORD GIVE ONE LOOK OR USE ONE ACTION THAT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY
WHEN AT LAST HE GOT UP TO DEPART SANDFORD THOUGHT HE PRESSED HIS HAND AND SHOOK IT WITH MORE WARMTH THAN EVER HE HAD DONE IN HIS LIFE
NO TO MY HOUSE IN TOWN WHERE I INTEND TO BE ALL THE WINTER AND WHERE WE SHALL LIVE TOGETHER SHE TURNED HER FACE ON THE PILLOW TO CONCEAL TEARS OF JOY BUT HER SOBS REVEALED THEM
YOU KNEELED TO ME LAST NIGHT I NOW KNEEL TO YOU SHE CRIED KNEEL NEVER DESIRING TO RISE AGAIN IF YOU PERSIST IN YOUR INTENTION
BUT LOOKED WITH A RESIGNATION WHICH FOREBODED HER SORROW GREATER THAN THE SEVEREST REPROACHES WOULD HAVE DONE
WHETHER HE SAW HER EMBARRASSMENT AND WISHED TO RELEASE HER FROM IT OR WAS IN HASTE TO CONCEAL HIS OWN HE LEFT HER ALMOST INSTANTLY
AND MISS MILNER MAY CLAIM RELATIONSHIP WITH MADAME DE CLEVES
LORD ELMWOOD INQUIRING OF THE LADIES HOW THEY HAD PASSED THEIR MORNING MISS MILNER FRANKLY TOLD HIM
A CHICKEN BOILED OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
GAVE HER SOMETHING ELSE
YES--AS HE HEARD YOU WERE ILL HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO COME AND SEE YOU HE IS VERY GOOD SHE ANSWERED AND THE TEAR STARTED IN HER EYES
WITHOUT FEAR OR SHAME HE FOLLOWED SANDFORD INTO HIS CHAMBER AT THE TIME OF HIS RETIRING AND ENTREATED OF HIM WITH ALL THE ANXIETY HE SUFFERED TO EXPLAIN HIS ALLUSION WHEN HE TALKED OF A LOVER AND OF INSOLENCE TO LADY MATILDA
HER APPETITE FORSOOK HER
SINCERE LOVE AT LEAST AMONG THE DELICATE OF THE FEMALE SEX IS OFTEN GRATIFIED BY THAT DEGREE OF ENJOYMENT OR RATHER FORBEARANCE WHICH WOULD BE TORTURE IN THE PURSUIT OF ANY OTHER PASSION
IF YOU IMAGINE THESE THOUGHTS WERE UPON LADY ELMWOOD I WILL NEVER INTRUDE AGAIN
THUS AT ONCE DESTROYING ALL THOSE PLANS OF HAPPINESS WHICH POOR MISS MILNER HAD FORMED
NOW THEN LORD ELMWOOD THIS MOMENT GIVE HER UP FOR EVER OR THIS MOMENT CONSTRAIN HER BY SUCH TIES FROM OFFENDING YOU AS SHE SHALL NOT DARE TO VIOLATE LORD ELMWOOD STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD IN DOUBT AND AGITATION
AND THAT SHOULD HE ONCE RASHLY QUIT HIS HOUSE THE DOORS MOST PROBABLY WOULD BE SHUT AGAINST HIM FOR EVER
BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED IF EVER BREACH OF CONFIDENCE COULD BE TOLERATED I CERTAINLY KNOW NO OCCASION THAT WOULD SO JUSTLY AUTHORISE IT AS THE PRESENT
AND WHEN BY ANY ACCIDENT HE WAS OBLIGED TO MENTION IT IT WAS WITHOUT ANY MARKS EITHER OF SATISFACTION OR CONCERN
SITTING IN HER DRESSING-ROOM ONE FORENOON WITH MISS WOODLEY AND BURTHENED WITH A LOAD OF GRIEF THAT SHE BLUSHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHILE HER COMPANION WAS CHARGED WITH APPREHENSIONS THAT SHE TOO WAS LOATH TO DISCLOSE ONE OF LORD ELMWOOD'S VALETS TAPPED GENTLY AT THE DOOR AND DELIVERED A LETTER TO MISS MILNER
HIS ENEMIES INDEED HINTED THAT HE HAD BUT ENEMIES HE NEVER HARKENED TO
THE EXTREME DISGUST AND HORROR HIS PRESENCE INSPIRED CAUSED MATILDA FOR A MOMENT TO FORGET ALL HER WANT OF POWER HER WANT OF HEALTH HER WEAKNESS
AS THEY ADVANCED IN THEIR DINNER THE EMBARRASSMENT OF MISS WOODLEY AND OF MR SANDFORD DIMINISHED
HAVING IN THESE BOOKS STORE OF COMFORT FOR POOR MATILDA SHE EAGERLY RETURNED WITH THEM
I THOUGHT MY DISINCLINATION TO YOU MIGHT PERHAPS ARISE FROM PREJUDICE--THIS CONVERSATION HAS RELIEVED ME FROM THOSE FEARS AND--I THANK YOU SAYING THIS HE CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AND LEFT RUSHBROOK TO REFLECT ON WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING
THE SAME WORDS WERE REPEATED TO HIM AS TO ME THOUGH FROM HER REASON MATILDA COULD NOT DOUBT OF ANY MISTAKE FROM MR SANDFORD YET HER FEARS SUGGESTED A THOUSAND SCRUPLES
NAY THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TOO RETURNED HE WITH ANXIETY--"YOU SHARE HER CONFIDENCE--YOU ARE PERPETUALLY WITH HER
IMPRESSED WITH THE IDEA OF THE STATE IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HIS ONLY CHILD MISS WOODLEY WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD TO BID HIM FAREWELL WAS PALE TREMBLING AND IN TEARS
YES YES HERE IT IS REPEATED SANDFORD WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND.----HE THEN READ THE PARAGRAPH
SHE HEARD A FOOTSTEP ADVANCING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE HOPED TO HAVE BEEN CONCEALED
TO THE RELIEF OF RUSHBROOK LORD ELMWOOD THAT DAY DINED FROM HOME AND HE HAD NOT THE CONFUSION TO SEE HIM AGAIN TILL THE EVENING
LORD ELMWOOD WHO HAD JOINED THE LADIES WALKED HOME WITH THEM
FOR HER MIND WAS SO TOTALLY ABSTRACTED FROM ANY CONSIDERATION OF THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT DISCERN A SINGLE BLUSH OR CONFUSED GLANCE WHICH THEIR PRESENCE OCCASIONED
BUT NOW HE WATCHED HER AS HE WOULD A CHILD
SHE WAS BURIED IN KENSINGTON CHURCHYARD
BUT AS HE QUITTED IT CALLED OUT MY LORD ELMWOOD IF YOU HAVE ANY DEMANDS ON ME THE EARL INTERRUPTED HIM WOULD YOU MAKE ME AN EXECUTIONER
AFTER ENQUIRING AND BEING TOLD THAT HE WAS GONE DORRIFORTH RETURNED TO HIS OWN APARTMENT
PREVIOUS TO THIS SANDFORD AND HE MET AT DINNER
WITH THESE HOPES HE AGAIN PAID MISS WOODLEY AND HER A VISIT
SHE DID NOT RETURN TO DINNER NOR TILL IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING
SHE SAW IT BEAM EXPECTATION AMAZEMENT JOY ARDOUR AND LOVE.----NAY THERE WAS A FIRE A VEHEMENCE IN THE QUICK FASCINATING RAYS IT SENT FORTH SHE NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN--IT FILLED HER WITH ALARM--SHE WISHED HIM TO LOVE MISS MILNER BUT TO LOVE HER WITH MODERATION
MY TEMPER IS CHANGED OF LATE
MISS MILNER WENT TO THE LOOKING-GLASS BREATHED UPON HER HANDS AND RUBBED THEM ON HER EYES SMOOTHED HER HAIR AND ADJUSTED HER DRESS
AND HAVING BOUNDED HER WISHES BY HER HOPES THE HEIGHT OF HER HAPPINESS WAS LIMITED TO A CONVERSATION IN WHICH NO OTHER BUT THEMSELVES TOOK A PART
HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS
MY LORD I DARE NOT.--THE LAST TIME I NAMED HER TO YOU YOU THREATENED TO ABANDON ME FOR MY ARROGANCE LORD ELMWOOD STARTED.----"MY DAUGHTER
THE FASHIONABLE MRS G GAVE A MASKED BALL
BUT PUT BOTH HIS HANDS INTO HIS BOSOM AND WALKED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM
SINCE YESTERDAY REFLECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME WAS BECOME PAINFUL TO HIM
RUSHBROOK THOUGHT HE SAW HIS UNCLE'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS THEY ENTERED THE AVENUE YET HE DID NOT APPEAR LESS IN SPIRITS
AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
TO SANDFORD IT WAS STILL MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO APPLY
NOTWITHSTANDING HER RESTRICTION ON THE LATTER OCCASION THE RESIDENCE OF HER FATHER IN THAT HOUSE HAD BEEN A SOURCE OF PLEASURE RATHER THAN OF SORROW TO HER
THE LAST AND ONLY REMAINING BRANCH OF HIS FAMILY
HE WAS WITH MY LADY REPLIED THE STEWARD
WHAT INGRATITUDE ASKED MATILDA DO YOU SUPPOSE MR RUSHBROOK IS THE CAUSE THAT MY FATHER WILL NOT SEE ME
FOR YOU HAD STILL I SEE A GENTLEMAN WITH YOU OH
MISS MILNER DID NOT LOOK THAT WAY
SHE DID NOT REFLECT THAT TO THE SEARCHING EYE OF LORD ELMWOOD SHE HAD FAULTS WITH HER UTMOST CARE TO CONCEAL OR OVERCOME THEM SUFFICIENT TO TRY ALL HIS LOVE AND ALL HIS PATIENCE
IS THIS THE END OF ALL OUR HOPES?--OF THY OWN FEARFUL HOPES--AND OF THY MOTHER'S SUPPLICATIONS
THOUGH MISS WOODLEY FOLLOWED HER SO THAT MR SANDFORD WAS LEFT ALONE WITH LORD ELMWOOD AND MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED HIS UNKIND INSINUATIONS WITHOUT ONE RESTRAINT YET HIS LIPS WERE CLOSED FOR THE PRESENT
A SIMPLE STORY IS IN ITS SMALL WAY A DESCENDANT OF THE TRAGEDIES OF RACINE
AND I HOPE YOU FOUND BENEFIT FROM THEM SAID MISS MILNER WITH GREAT KINDNESS AS SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM
AND AS WE WALK THERE TO-DAY AMID THE PRESS OF THE LIVING IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SHE TOO WAS FAMILIAR WITH LEICESTER SQUARE
BEFORE SHE COULD RESOLVE HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND SAID WITH A FORCE AND WARMTH SHE HAD NEVER HEARD HIM USE BEFORE I COMMAND YOU TO STAY AT HOME THIS EVENING AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
AND SHE SAYS IT IS A SIGN I SHALL DIE YOUNG AND IS REALLY MUCH AFFECTED AT IT LORD ELMWOOD TURNED AWAY BEFORE THIS RIDICULOUS SPEECH WAS CONCLUDED
SOMETIMES HE ACCOMPANIED LORD ELMWOOD AT OTHER TIMES HE CAME TO SEE DORRIFORTH ALONE WHO GENERALLY INTRODUCED HIM TO THE LADIES
BUT THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED MORE THAN ALL THE ANGER WITH-HELD HIM
IN NATURE AND ART MRS INCHBALD'S SECOND NOVEL THE CLIMAX OF THE STORY IS TOLD IN A SERIES OF SHORT PARAGRAPHS WHICH FOR BITTERNESS AND CONCENTRATION OF STYLE ARE ALMOST REMINISCENT OF STENDHAL
NAY SHE WILL BE AWAKE I HAVE NO DOUBT RETURNED HER NIECE
ON THEIR ARRIVAL THEY WERE MET EVEN AT THE STREET-DOOR BY LADY MATILDA
AND HE IN HIS TURN REJOICED AS IF HE HAD ALREADY SEEN LADY MATILDA RESTORED TO LIBERTY
AND THIS LAST ASSURANCE OF YOUR KINDNESS IS BEYOND ANY OTHER FAVOUR YOU COULD HAVE BESTOWED
AND SHE THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO ENJOIN SANDFORD TILL HE DID REPEAT IT NOT TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN TO RUSHBROOK HIMSELF
MISS MILNER HAD SCARCE LEFT HER DRESSING ROOM WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TAKING OFF SOME PART OF HER DRESS WHEN DORRIFORTH'S SERVANT CAME TO ACQUAINT HER THAT HIS MASTER WAS ALONE IN HIS STUDY AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HER
KISSES HER MOTHER
HIS LONG-RESTRAINED TEARS NOW BURST FORTH--AND SEEING HER RELAPSING INTO THE SWOON HE CRIED OUT EAGERLY TO RECALL HER
AND AS HE WAS AN EXCELLENT GOOD MASTER A SINCERE FRIEND AND A MOST GENEROUS PATRON NOT ONE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE OR DEPENDANTS WERE HARDY ENOUGH TO DRAW UPON THEMSELVES HIS CERTAIN DISPLEASURE WHICH WAS ALWAYS VIOLENT IN THE EXTREME BY EVEN THE OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF LADY ELMWOOD'S DEATH
IT IS SAID A BOOK SHOULD BE READ WITH THE SAME SPIRIT WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THAT CASE FATAL MUST BE THE RECEPTION OF THIS--FOR THE WRITER FRANKLY AVOWS THAT DURING THE TIME SHE HAS BEEN WRITING IT SHE HAS SUFFERED EVERY QUALITY AND DEGREE OF WEARINESS AND LASSITUDE INTO WHICH NO OTHER EMPLOYMENT COULD HAVE BETRAYED HER
FOR EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD TO THE YOUNG MAN'S ADVANTAGE LITERALLY HAD SLIPPED HER MEMORY
AT LAST TURNING HIMSELF ROUND ON HIS SEAT TOWARDS MISS MILNER WHO SAT LIKE A STATUE OF DESPAIR AT HIS SIDE WILL YOU BREAKFAST WITH US TO-MORROW SAID HE
AND A TEAR HALF STARTING IN HER EYE WAS AN ADDITIONAL SUBJECT OF HER FRIEND'S OBSERVATION
HE HAD HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS FACE AT THE TIME OR SHE WOULD HAVE BEHELD THE AGITATION--THE REMOTEST SENSATIONS OF HIS HEART
THIS FREEDOM INDULGED FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT PERIL BECAME AT LAST LESS CAUTIOUS
AS GIFFARD STOOD TREMBLING WHILE HE RELIEVED HIS LORD FROM THIS HAPLESS BURTHEN HER FATHER HAD TO UNLOOSE HER HAND FROM THE SIDE OF HIS COAT WHICH SHE HAD CAUGHT FAST HOLD OF AS SHE FELL AND GRASPED SO CLOSELY IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY RELEASED.--ON ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THE HAND AWAY HE TREMBLED--FALTERED--THEN BADE GIFFARD DO IT
LORD ELMWOOD RESUMED WHAT
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD PARTED FROM MISS MILNER SINCE HE BECAME HER GUARDIAN AND HE FELT UPON THE OCCASION A RELUCTANCE
AND IT WAS BUT PROBABLE THE OLD PRIEST WOULD MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE SITUATION OF HIM AND OF LADY MATILDA ELMWOOD
MISS WOODLEY THEN RECOLLECTED FOR EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FORGOT IT THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS STILL AT THE DOOR TO CONVEY LORD ELMWOOD FAR AWAY
NOT TO ADMIRE MISS FENTON WAS IMPOSSIBLE--TO FIND ONE FAULT WITH HER PERSON OR SENTIMENTS WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE--AND YET TO LOVE HER WAS UNLIKELY
FERVENTLY ARDENTLY RETURNED HE
WITH ALL THE AUTHORITY AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COUNTRY MAGISTRATE SANDFORD--HIS BACK TO THE FIRE AND THE WITNESSES BEFORE HIM BEGAN WITH THE FOOTMAN
ARE YOU SURE HE DID GRANT IT
IT WAS IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER AND JUST DARK AT THE TIME RUSHBROOK WAS LEFT ALONE YET IN THE AGITATION OF HIS MIND ARISING FROM THE SUBJECT ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN TALKING HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THE HOUSE AND THEREFORE WALKED INTO THE FIELDS
THAT HEAVENLY AID WHICH RELIGION GIVES AND WHICH NOW AMIDST THESE AGONIZING TORTURES CHEERS WITH HUMBLER HOPE MY AFFLICTED SOUL
BUT HERE TO WHAT POINT I MAY LIMIT OR YOU MAY EXTEND THIS KIND OF VENIAL DECEIT MAY SO WIDELY DIFFER THAT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO REMAIN UNACQUAINTED WITH YOUR SENTIMENTS EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE REVEALED THEM TO ME
IS IT YOU
SUCH WERE THE PASTIMES OF MRS SIDDONS BEFORE THE DAYS OF HER FAME
FOR THOUGH HE RETIRED SOME TIME BEFORE HIS NEPHEW WHEN RUSHBROOK PASSED HIS CHAMBER DOOR IT WAS OPEN AND HE NOT IN BED BUT SITTING IN A MUSING POSTURE AS IF HE HAD FORGOT TO SHUT IT
SHE HAD A COMPANION WHOM SHE LOVED WITH AN EQUAL FONDNESS WITH WHICH SHE HAD LOVED HER DECEASED MOTHER
YOU WILL THEN SEE WHAT EFFECT THAT WILL HAVE UPON HIS PRIDE BUT YOU WILL THEN MAKE IT TOO LATE FOR HIM TO BE HUMBLE
FROM THE CONSTANCY OF HIS DISPOSITION SHE DEPENDED THAT SENTIMENTS LIKE THESE WERE NOT TOTALLY ERADICATED
MISS MILNER COVERED WITH SHAME SUNK ON THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY
MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT OF RUSHBROOK OF SANDFORD OF LORD ELMWOOD--BUT WHAT COULD SHE HOPE FROM THE WANT OF POWER IN THE TWO FORMER?--WHAT FROM THE LATTER FOR THE WANT OF WILL
HOWEVER AS I AM NOT A MEMBER OF YOUR CHURCH I SUBMIT TO THE PERSECUTION OF A HERETIC AND I ANSWER--LORD FREDERICK HAS NEITHER MY WORD NOR ANY SHARE IN MY AFFECTIONS SANDFORD DORRIFORTH AND MISS WOODLEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A DEGREE OF SURPRISE THAT FOR SOME TIME KEPT THEM SILENT
AND IS NOT THAT A JUST REASON FOR MY SUSPICIONS BUT IS THERE ONLY ONE MAN IN THE WORLD ON WHOM THOSE SUSPICIONS CAN FIX SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH THE COLOUR MOUNTING INTO HER FACE
DURING WHICH TIME HER GUARDIAN WAS FREQUENTLY THE SUBJECT OF THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATION
AND THOUGH EVERY MOMENT I BREATHED WAS A WISH TO CAST MYSELF AT HIS DAUGHTER'S FEET YET AS I FEARED MISS WOODLEY THAT YOU WERE INCENSED AGAINST ME BY WHAT MEANS WAS I TO PROCURE AN INTERVIEW BUT BY STRATAGEM OR FORCE
AND IT WAS THIS SENSIBILITY WHICH URGED HIM TO FLY FROM ITS MORE KEEN RECOLLECTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE--THIS HE ALLEGED AS THE REASON WHY HE WOULD NEVER PERMIT LADY ELMWOOD OR EVEN HER CHILD TO BE NAMED IN HIS HEARING
AND YET I COULD NOT HAVE SUPPOSED IT IS A SUBJECT WE CANNOT SPEAK ON SANDFORD THEREFORE LET US DROP IT AT THESE WORDS THE DISCOURSE CONCLUDED
IT WAS OF COURSE DISMISSED--AND ONE OF THOSE GREAT INCIDENTS OF DELIGHT WHICH MISS MILNER THAT MORNING TASTED WAS TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SEE THIS VERY CARRIAGE DRIVE FROM THE DOOR UNOCCUPIED
SHE FOUND THERE WERE NO OTHER MEANS TO SUPPORT HER LIFE
IT WAS NEVERTHELESS A SUBJECT TOO DELICATE FOR HIM TO TOUCH UPON IN ANY ONE SENSE--AN INVITATION FOR HER COMPANY ON HIS PART MIGHT CARRY THE APPEARANCE OF SUPERIOR AUTHORITY AND AN AFFECTED CONDESCENSION WHICH HE JUSTLY CONSIDERED AS THE WORST OF ALL INSULTS
IT WAS TO ASK HIM TO BE HIS SECOND;--THE YOUNG EARL STARTED AND WISHED TO CONSULT HIS TUTOR BUT THAT HIS KINSMAN STRICTLY FORBADE
SHE IS DOUBTFUL TO WHICH TO GIVE THE PREFERENCE--ONE HOWEVER RUSHES THE FOREMOST AND CONTINUES SO
FOR AS SHE HAD HERSELF NEVER RECEIVED SUCH A PROOF OF HIS CARE SINCE ALL THEIR LONG ACQUAINTANCE SHE REASONABLY SUPPOSED MATILDA'S READING AND NOT HERS WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS SOLICITUDE
HONOUR IS THE LAW OF THE POLITE PART OF THE LAND
WHAT AN IMMORTAL FIGURE THE DIM MRS HORTON WOULD HAVE BECOME IN THE HANDS OF JANE AUSTEN
BUT INSTEAD OF THE SYMPATHY THIS MIGHT HAVE EXCITED IN SOME DISPOSITIONS MR SANDFORD AFTER CASTING A LOOK AT EACH OF THEM APPEARED IN HIGH SPIRITS
BUT I DID NOT LIKE TO APPEAR UNREASONABLE IN YOUR ABSENCE SANDFORD FIXED HIS INQUISITIVE EYES UPON LORD ELMWOOD TO OBSERVE HIS COUNTENANCE--HE SMILED BUT APPEARED THOUGHTFUL
A BRIEF SKETCH OF IT MAY BE WELCOME TO HER READERS
WHAT DO YOU KNOW MADAM SAID HE SHARPLY
UPON EVERY OCCASION AND UPON EVERY TOPIC EXCEPT THAT OF LADY ELMWOOD AND HER CHILD SANDFORD WAS JUST AS FREE WITH LORD ELMWOOD AS HE HAD EVER BEEN
FOR THEY SAT UP BEYOND THEIR USUAL HOUR TO INDULGE IT
WHICH WAS IN RUSHBROOK'S MIND AN HONOUR THAT RENDERED HIM SUPERIOR TO WHAT HE WAS BEFORE
MISS MILNER AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED ASIDE TO CONCEAL THEIR TEARS
DO NOT REFUSE AN ASYLUM EVEN IN YOUR OWN HOUSE TO THE DESTITUTE OFFSPRING OF YOUR FRIEND
I AM NO LONGER ENGAGED TO MISS MILNER THAN SHE SHALL DESERVE I SHOULD BE--BUT IN MY STRICT OBSERVATIONS UPON HER CONDUCT I WILL TAKE CARE NOT TO WRONG HER AS YOU HAVE DONE MY LORD CALL MY OBSERVATIONS WRONG WHEN YOU HAVE REFLECTED UPON THEM AS A MAN AND NOT AS A LOVER--DIVEST YOURSELF OF YOUR PASSION AND MEET ME UPON EQUAL GROUND I WILL MEET NO ONE--I WILL CONSULT NO ONE--MY OWN JUDGMENT SHALL BE THE JUDGE AND IN A FEW MONTHS MARRY OR--_BANISH ME FROM HER FOR EVER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THESE LAST WORDS IN THE TONE AND FIRMNESS WITH WHICH THEY WERE DELIVERED THAT THE HEART OF SANDFORD RESTED UPON WITH CONTENT--THEY BORE THE SYMPTOMS OF A MENACE THAT WOULD BE EXECUTED
WHO WISHED FROM HIS REGARD TO LADY MATILDA RATHER TO DELAY THAN HURRY THEIR JOURNEY
THE FORLORN STATE OF MISS FENTON OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A SUBJECT FOR COMPASSION BUT SHE KNEW THAT LADY HAD RESIGNATION TO BEAR ANY LOT WITH PATIENCE AND THAT A TRIAL OF HER FORTITUDE MIGHT BE MORE FLATTERING TO HER VANITY THAN TO BE COUNTESS OF ELMWOOD
NO SOONER WERE THE FIRST KIND GREETINGS OVER THAN THE DREAD OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO INFORM THEM OF POSSESSED POOR MATILDA AND MISS WOODLEY SO POWERFULLY THAT ALL THEIR GLADNESS WAS CHANGED INTO AFFRIGHT
GRATEFUL FOR THE SERVICE HE HAD RENDERED THEM MISS WOODLEY AND HER CHARGE PERMITTED HIM TO ENQUIRE OCCASIONALLY AFTER THEIR HEALTH AND WOULD SOMETIMES SEE HIM
NOR WAS THE FORTITUDE OF MATILDA WHICH CAME TO HER ASSISTANCE ON THE FIRST ONSET OF THIS TRIAL SUFFICIENT TO ARM HER WHEN THE MOMENT CAME SHE WAS TO QUIT THE HOUSE--HER FATHER'S HOUSE--NEVER TO SEE THAT OR HIM AGAIN
MRS INCHBALD AND HER COMPANIONS WOULD SET OUT TO WALK FROM ONE SCOTCH TOWN TO ANOTHER
PARTLY THEREFORE TO INDULGE HER HAPLESS COMPANION AND PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS A DUTY MISS WOODLEY ONCE AGAIN PAID LORD ELMWOOD A MORNING VISIT AND STAID DINNER
AND IN A CONTENTION WHAT RIVAL WOULD NOT FALL BEFORE HER
THIS LAST FAVOUR HAD A CLAIM UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S GRATITUDE SUPERIOR TO EVERY OTHER OBLIGATION WHICH SINCE HIS INFANCY HIS BENEFACTOR HAD CONFERRED
NO"----(AND HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN THOU ALL GREAT ALL WISE AND OMNIPOTENT BEING THOU WHOM I HAVE MOST OFFENDED IT IS TO THEE ALONE THAT I HAVE RECOURSE IN THIS HOUR OF TRIBULATION AND FROM THEE ALONE I SOLICIT COMFORT
BUT WHICH THOUGH EAGER AS SHE WAS IN THEIR PURSUIT SHE NEVER PLACED IN COMPETITION WITH THOSE SHE HOPED WOULD SUCCEED--THOSE MORE SEDATE AND SUPERIOR JOYS OF DOMESTIC AND CONJUGAL HAPPINESS
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROSPECTS HIS DEATH POINTED OUT TO HER IT WAS WITH INFINITE JOY SHE HEARD HE WAS RECOVERED
IN PEACE IN CONTENT THOUGH NOT IN HAPPINESS THE DAYS AND WEEKS PASSED AWAY TILL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST WHEN PREPARATIONS BEGAN TO BE MADE FOR THE ARRIVAL OF LORD ELMWOOD
MISS WOODLEY THEREFORE THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO ALLAY THESE ECSTASIES AND REPRESENTED TO HER SHE MIGHT BE DECEIVED IN HER HOPES--OR EVEN SUPPOSING HIS WISHES INCLINED TOWARDS HER THERE WERE YET GREAT OBSTACLES BETWEEN THEM.--"WOULD NOT SANDFORD WHO DIRECTED HIS EVERY THOUGHT AND PURPOSE BE CONSULTED UPON THIS
IN THE LITERAL SENSE TO SUFFER THAT SHE MAY RESIDE AT ONE OF MY SEATS
BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED--SUCH IS THE GRATITUDE OF THE WORLD--AND SUCH IS YOURS MY LORD IF YOU DOUBT MY GRATITUDE GIVE ME A PROOF OF IT HARRY AND I WILL DOUBT NO LONGER UPON EVERY OTHER SUBJECT BUT THIS MY LORD HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS YOUR HAPPINESS LORD ELMWOOD INTERRUPTED HIM
FOR ALTHOUGH MY LORD FREDERICK IS NOT THE VERY MAN I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR YOUR PERFECT HAPPINESS
SHE CAST HER EYES THERE AND SEEING WHERE THE BALL HAD ENTERED THE COAT SLEEVE SHE GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY SCREAM AND SUNK UPON THE SOFA
BUT UNDETERMINED WHETHER TO GO FORWARD OR TO CROSS TO ANOTHER PATH HE STILL WALKED ON TILL HE CAME TOO NIGH TO RECEDE
SUNDAY
MATILDA WHO HAD BEEN TILL THIS TIME WORKING AT HER NEEDLE SEEMINGLY COMPOSED NOW LET HER WORK DROP FROM HER HAND AND SAT FOR A WHILE IN A DEEP REVERIE
MISS MILNER WAS NOT WITH HER FATHER AT THIS AFFECTING PERIOD--SOME DELICATELY NERVOUS FRIEND WITH WHOM SHE WAS ON A VISIT AT BATH THOUGHT PROPER TO CONCEAL FROM HER NOT ONLY THE DANGER OF HIS DEATH BUT EVEN HIS INDISPOSITION LEST IT MIGHT ALARM A MIND SHE THOUGHT TOO SUSCEPTIBLE
BUT WHAT FEMALE IS NOT FOND OF EXPERIMENTS
YOU HAVE HURRIED ME INTO A MISTAKE THAT MIGHT HAVE COST ME MY LIFE OR THE LIFE OF THE MAN YOU LOVE
I THAT HAVE LIVED FOR SO MANY YEARS UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HIM AND ON THE MOST FRIENDLY TERMS AND HE GOING AWAY PERHAPS FOR THESE TEN YEARS PERHAPS FOR EVER I SHOULD THINK IT A DISRESPECT NOT TO SEE HIM TO THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS REMAINING IN THE HOUSE THEN DO YOU GO SAID MISS MILNER EAGERLY
BUT FROM HIS INDIFFERENCE TO ALL I HAVE SAID ON THE OCCASION I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED HER NAME TO HIM
AS HE BOWED IN TOKEN OF OBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS A SHOWER OF TEARS COVERED HIS FACE
BUT IN SOME RESPECTS I AM LIKE ROMAN CATHOLICS
AND YET SAID HE TO HIMSELF IT IS LOVE OF SUCH A KIND AS ARISING FROM CAUSES INDEPENDENT OF THE OBJECT ITSELF CAN SCARCE DESERVE THAT SACRED NAME
SHE COULD NOT GO BACK AND HAD NOT COURAGE TO GO ON
AND TURNING TO THE SERVANT DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR LADY HAD ON YES MADAM REPLIED THE MAN SHE WAS IN MEN'S CLOTHES HOW CRIED LORD ELMWOOD
BUT HOW WAS SHE TO FOLLOW
I WILL NOT SEE ALL THESE QUALITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS DEBASED
IN A TREMULOUS VOICE HE INSTANTLY CRIED WHAT OF HER AND ROSE FROM HIS SEAT
HE INQUIRED IF SHE WAS IN HEALTH SUFFICIENT TO PURSUE HER JOURNEY OR IF SHE WOULD REMAIN WHERE SHE WAS I AM ABLE TO GO WITH YOU SHE ANSWERED INSTANTLY
TWO WHOLE DAYS PASSED IN THE BITTEREST SUSPENSE ON THE PART OF MISS MILNER WHILE NEITHER ONE WORD OR LOOK FROM LORD ELMWOOD DENOTED THE MOST TRIVIAL CHANGE OF THE SENTIMENTS HE HAD DECLARED ON THE NIGHT OF THE MASQUERADE
A LITTLE TIME AFTER ONE OF MISS MILNER'S FOOTMEN CAME IN UPON SOME OCCASION AND MR SANDFORD SAID TO HIM PRAY DID YOU ATTEND YOUR LADY TO THE MASQUERADE YES SIR REPLIED THE MAN
MY DEAR CRIED MISS WOODLEY HOW CAN YOU TALK THUS
SHE WAS NOW IN HER SEVENTEENTH YEAR--OF THE SAME AGE WITHIN A YEAR AND A FEW MONTHS OF HER MOTHER WHEN SHE BECAME THE WARD OF DORRIFORTH
WHETHER TO SPEAK OR TO BE SILENT
LORD ELMWOOD GAZED BY TURNS AT EACH AS EACH DELIVERED THEIR SENTIMENTS--AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL SILENT HE LOOKED BEWILDERED NOT KNOWING WHAT JUDGMENT TO FORM FROM ANY OF THESE SENTENCES
MR SANDFORD WHO CAME WITH LORD ELMWOOD TO THE NEIGHBOURING SEAT ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF MISS MILNER AT HER'S WAS SO SCRUPULOUSLY EXACT IN THE OBSERVANCE OF HIS WORD NEVER TO ENTER A HOUSE OF MISS MILNER'S THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN CALL UPON HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH THERE--BUT IN THEIR WALKS AND AT LORD ELMWOOD'S THE TWO PARTIES WOULD OCCASIONALLY JOIN AND OF COURSE SANDFORD AND SHE AT THOSE TIMES MET--YET SO DISTANT WAS THE RESERVE ON EITHER SIDE THAT NOT A SINGLE WORD UPON ANY OCCASION WAS EVER EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM
SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
AND MR GIFFARD RELATED WORD FOR WORD WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LORD
FOR YOU FREELY CENSURE HER AND YET IMAGINE I WILL SUFFER IT MY LORD REPLIED SANDFORD I AM UNDECEIVED NOW AND SHALL NEVER TAKE THAT LIBERTY AGAIN AS LORD ELMWOOD ALWAYS TREATED SANDFORD WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT HE BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT UPON THIS OCCASION
WITHIN A FEW YEARS I SHALL BE DEAD--AND HOW HAPPY WILL IT THEN BE IF I HAVE RESISTED EVERY TEMPTATION TO THE ALLURING PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE THE HAPPINESS OF A PEACEFUL DEATH OCCUPIED HER CONTEMPLATION FOR NEAR AN HOUR
IN THAT TIME YOU HAVE RUN THE HAZARD OF BEING MURDERED AND WHAT IS WORSE OF BEING EXCOMMUNICATED
NOR EVEN INVENT ONE PROBABLE EXCUSE FOR LEAVING LADY LUNEHAM BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME WHICH WAS THEN AT THE DISTANCE OF TWO MONTHS
DO YOU UPBRAID ME WITH MY RESPECT MY PITY FOR HER
IN WHAT DRESS DID YOUR LADY GO TO THE MASQUERADE ASKED HE AND WITH A LOOK SO EXTREMELY MOROSE IT SEEMED TO COMMAND THE ANSWER IN A SINGLE WORD AND THAT WORD TO BE TRUTH
LORD ELMWOOD WENT EAGERLY TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE AND TAKING UP EACH BOOK EXAMINED MINUTELY WHAT IT WAS
I SAW HIM PASS IN VIOLENT HASTE THROUGH THE HALL
SANDFORD WAS ASHAMED TO SEEM TO NOTICE IT YET HE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HIM TO TAKE A GLASS OF WINE HE TOOK IT--AND FOR ONCE EVINCED HE WAS REDUCED SO LOW AS TO BE GLAD OF SUCH A RESOURCE
HE MUST EITHER BEHOLD HER AND VENTURE HER DISPLEASURE OR BY DIFFIDENCE DURING ONE MOMENT GIVE UP ALL HIS HOPES PERHAPS FOR EVER
AT THE MEETING BETWEEN HIM AND LORD ELMWOOD TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED FOR HIS FINAL ANSWER ON THAT SUBJECT WHICH HAD ONCE NEARLY PROVED SO FATAL TO HIM
FOR GOOD HUMOUR LIKE THE JAUNDICE MAKES EVERY ONE OF ITS OWN COMPLEXION
BUT LEFT HER GUARDIAN AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE AS MUCH AT A LOSS TO DECIDE UPON HER TRUE SENTIMENTS AS HE WAS BEFORE HE HAD THUS SERIOUSLY REQUESTED HE MIGHT BE INFORMED OF THEM
DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN LOVE HIM
THE MOMENT HE ARRIVES IT IS MY RESOLUTION THAT YOU REFUSE TO SEE HIM OR CONSENT TO BECOME HIS WIFE IN ANSWER TO THE ALTERNATIVE THUS OFFERED SHE APPEARED AVERSE TO BOTH PROPOSITIONS
THERE WERE NOT WANTING AMONG HIS MOST FAVOURITE COUNSELLORS SOME WHO PAINTED THE SUPERIOR TRIUMPH AND GRATIFICATION OF FORCE
AND HE ONCE MORE TURNED HIS INQUIRING EYES UPON MISS WOODLEY
HAD YOU BEEN DISPASSIONATE HAD YOU SEEN MISS MILNER'S VIRTUES AS WELL AS HER FAULTS I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED AND BEEN GUIDED BY YOU--BUT YOU SAW HER FAILINGS ONLY AND THEREIN HAVE BEEN EQUALLY DECEIVED WITH ME WHO HAVE ONLY BEHELD HER PERFECTIONS MY OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER MY LORD WOULD HAVE BEEN OF MOST USE TO YOU
FOR WHAT BUT THE FORCE OF A MIRACLE CAN INDUCE HER TO CONTRADICT TO-DAY WHAT BEFORE YOU AND SEVERAL OTHER WITNESSES SHE POSITIVELY ACKNOWLEDGED YESTERDAY DO YOU CALL THAT MIRACULOUS CRIED SANDFORD
OR HAS THIS CONVERSATION ALTERED THEM SHE HESITATED AGAIN THEN ANSWERED--"THIS CONVERSATION HAS ALTERED THEM AND YET YOU CONFIDE IN IT CRIED SANDFORD LOOKING AT HER WITH CONTEMPT
MISS WOODLEY TO WHOM SHE REPEATED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HERSELF HER GUARDIAN AND SANDFORD TOOK THIS MOMENT IN THE AGITATION OF HER SPIRITS TO ALARM HER STILL MORE BY PROPHETIC INSINUATIONS
RELIEVED BY TEARS TOWARDS THE MORNING SHE SINKS INTO A SLUMBER BUT WAKING FINDS THE SAME IMAGES CROWDING ALL TOGETHER UPON HER MIND
DO YOU SUPPOSE I LOVE LORD FREDERICK
CHAPTER IX
CHAPTER IX
CHAPTER IX
CHAPTER IX
AND FREQUENTLY IN THIS CHARMING MANSION WHERE SHE HAD SO OFTEN BEHELD LADY ELMWOOD HER IMAGINATION REPRESENTED MATILDA AS HER FRIEND RISEN FROM THE GRAVE IN HER FORMER YOUTH HEALTH AND EXQUISITE BEAUTY
IT IS MISS MILNER YOUR WARD TO WHOM YOU NEVER REFUSED A REQUEST WHO SUPPLICATES YOU--NOT NOW FOR YOUR NEPHEW RUSHBROOK BUT FOR ONE SO MUCH MORE DEAR THAT A DENIAL----SHE DARES NOT SUFFER HER THOUGHTS TO GLANCE THAT WAY.--SHE WILL HOPE--AND IN THAT HOPE BIDS YOU FAREWELL WITH ALL THE LOVE SHE EVER BORE YOU
BESIDES HIS PURSUIT WAS TROUBLESOME WHILE IT WAS NO TRIUMPH TO HER VANITY WHICH BY THE ADDRESSES OF LORD FREDERICK WAS IN THE HIGHEST MANNER GRATIFIED
IT HAS BEEN FORMED EVER SINCE MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER AND IT CONTINUES THE SAME BUT INSTRUCT ME HOW I AM TO INSPIRE HER WITH CONFIDENCE RETURNED DORRIFORTH
AT DINNER THEY LEARNT THAT LORD ELMWOOD WAS TO GO THAT EVENING TO WINDSOR IN ORDER TO BE IN READINESS FOR THE KING'S HUNT EARLY IN THE MORNING
AT TEN O'CLOCK HE ARRIVED
SHE HAD BESIDES ACQUIRED THE DANGEROUS CHARACTER OF A WIT
FOR IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE I WOULD NOT HAVE SAID WHAT I DID REPLIED MISS MILNER BUT LEFT HIM TO VINDICATE HIMSELF IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I CAN WANT ANY VINDICATION
WITH VOICE AND MANNERS SO SERIOUS SO SOLEMN AND SO FERVENT HE PERFORMED THESE RITES THAT EVERY IDEA OF JEST OR EVEN OF LIGHTNESS WAS ABSENT FROM THE MIND OF ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
AND HAS DESIRED ME TO GIVE OR TO REFUSE IT YOU AT MY OWN PLEASURE O HEAVENS CRIED RUSHBROOK IN TRANSPORT HAS HE HE HAS INDEED--BEFORE MR SANDFORD AND MISS WOODLEY
SO THAT UNTIL YOU COMMAND ME TO LEAVE YOUR HOUSE AS I SUPPOSE YOU WILL SOON DO TO OBLIGE YOUR LADY I WILL CONTINUE ALONG WITH YOU LORD ELMWOOD LIKED HIM SINCERELY AND WAS GLAD THAT HE TOOK THIS RESOLUTION
VERY HAPPY
VERY HAPPY
UPON WHICH WITHOUT THE SMALLEST SALUTATION HE TURNED FROM HIM AGAIN ABRUPTLY AND RUDELY
AND I ASSURE YOU SERIOUSLY THAT IT WAS FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE DESCRIBED HE CAME WITH ME HOME--YET I MUST OWN THAT IF I HAD NOT HAD THIS DESIGN UPON LORD ELMWOOD'S JEALOUSY IN IDEA I WOULD HAVE WALKED ON FOOT THROUGH THE STREETS RATHER THAN HAVE SUFFERED HIS RIVAL'S CIVILITIES
WITHOUT ONE COMMAND RESPECTING HER OR ONE WORD OF ANY KIND
HE SHEWED HER SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL PRINTS WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD JUST RECEIVED FROM LONDON AND APPEARED ANXIOUS TO ENTERTAIN AND GIVE TOKENS OF HIS ESTEEM AND RESPECT FOR HER
I BEG YOUR PARDON--IT CANNOT BE
I BEG PARDON CRIED SANDFORD FOR SPEAKING SO RUDELY TO THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE--I HAVE NO BUSINESS HERE I KNOW
AND THIS FAINT AS IT WAS IN THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF EVERY OTHER HER IMAGINATION PAINTED TO HER AS EXCESSIVE
AND WHOEVER SHE MAY HAVE SELECTED FOR THE GUARDIAN OF HER CHILD HAS MY CONSENT TO ACT AS SUCH.--NOR IN ONE INSTANCE WHERE I MYSELF AM NOT CONCERNED SHALL I OPPOSE HER WILL THE TEARS RUSHED INTO HIS EYES AS HE SAID THIS AND CAUSED THEM TO START IN THE STEWARD'S--OBSERVING WHICH HE STERNLY RESUMED DO NOT SUPPOSE FROM THIS CONVERSATION THAT ANY OF THOSE RESOLUTIONS I HAVE LONG SINCE TAKEN ARE OR WILL BE CHANGED--THEY ARE THE SAME
DID MRS INCHBALD TAKE THE SUGGESTION OF A HEROINE WITH IMPERFECTIONS FROM THE LITTLE MASTERPIECE WHICH ON MORE SIDES THAN ONE CLOSELY TOUCHES HER'S--MANON LESCAUT
AND EACH OF THEM SAW THE OTHER TURN PALE AT THIS DESCRIPTION
IL NE FAUT POINT JUGER DES HOMMES PAR CE QU'ILS IGNORENT MAIS PAR CE QU'ILS SAVENT AND MRS INCHBALD'S KNOWLEDGE WAS AS PROFOUND AS IT WAS LIMITED
BUT WHEN THAT MEETING OCCURRED THOUGH HE OBSERVED SHE TALKED TO HIM WITH LESS RESERVE THAN SHE HAD FORMERLY DONE AND EVEN GAVE SOME PROOFS OF THE NATIVE GOODNESS OF HER DISPOSITION YET SHE SCRUPULOUSLY AVOIDED NAMING LADY MATILDA
AFTER A NIGHT'S REST IN LONDON LESS VIOLENTLY IMPRESSED WITH THE LOSS OF HER FATHER RECONCILED IF NOT ALREADY ATTACHED TO HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE HER THOUGHTS PLEASINGLY OCCUPIED WITH THE REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS IN THAT GAY METROPOLIS--A WILD AND RAPTUROUS PICTURE OF WHICH HER ACTIVE FANCY HAD OFTEN FORMED--MISS MILNER WAKED FROM A PEACEFUL AND REFRESHING SLEEP WITH MUCH OF THAT VIVACITY AND WITH ALL THOSE AIRY CHARMS WHICH FOR A WHILE HAD YIELDED THEIR TRANSCENDENT POWER TO THE WEAKER INFLUENCE OF HER FILIAL SORROW
NO INDEED REPLIED SANDFORD SHAKING HIS HEAD
VAIN HER MANY LOOKS TO HER BOX-DOOR IN HOPES TO SEE IT OPEN--LORD ELMWOOD NEVER CAME
BESIDES SAID SHE TO MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD STILL HER FEARS DO YOU NOT WISH HIS UNCLE SHOULD HAVE A WARMER INTEREST IN HIS CARE THAN DUTY?--IT IS DUTY ALONE WHICH INDUCES MR DORRIFORTH TO PROVIDE FOR HIM
NO HEAVEN FORBID HE REPLIED FOR I LOOK UPON THEM TO BE FORMED FOR EACH OTHER--THEIR DISPOSITIONS THEIR PURSUITS THEIR INCLINATIONS THE SAME
JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO DINNER THEIR BELL GENTLY RUNG AND IN WALKED SANDFORD
HER TEARS WHOLLY OVERCAME HER
AND THIS EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE WAS NOW THE ONLY ENJOYMENT SHE POSSESSED
THIS ACCIDENT HAS GIVEN A THIRD METHOD AND I HAD NOT STRENGTH I HAD NOT COURAGE TO LET IT PASS
RUSHBROOK ANIMATED THOUGH TREMBLING AT HER PRESENCE CRIED LADY MATILDA DO NOT AVOID ME TILL YOU KNOW THAT I DESERVE SUCH A PUNISHMENT SHE IMMEDIATELY SAW WHO IT WAS AND RETURNED BACK WITH A PROPER PRIDE AND YET A PROPER POLITENESS IN HER MANNER
HER HUMOUR IS NOT FAULTY BUT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLIGHT
SHE BEGGED ALSO TO BE ACQUAINTED HOW MR DORRIFORTH FOR STILL SHE CALLED HIM BY THAT NAME SPOKE AND THOUGHT OF THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN HIS DESTINY
THEREFORE LET NOT RELIGION BE NAMED BETWEEN US
WHEN THE CARRIAGE WHICH BROUGHT MISS MILNER STOPPED AT THE INN GATE AND HER NAME WAS ANNOUNCED TO DORRIFORTH HE TURNED PALE--SOMETHING LIKE A FOREBODING OF DISASTER TREMBLED AT HIS HEART AND CONSEQUENTLY SPREAD A GLOOM OVER ALL HIS FACE
LORD ELMWOOD'S LOVE TO HIS WIFE HAD BEEN EXTRAVAGANT--THE EFFECT OF HIS HATE WAS THE SAME
ON THE MORNING OF HER JOURNEY WHEN DORRIFORTH GAVE HIS HAND AND CONDUCTED MISS MILNER TO THE CARRIAGE ALL THE WAY HE LED HER SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER TEARS
HAPPY
THERE ARE NEVERTHELESS SOME ARTICLES UNDER THE FORMER CLASS WHICH OUGHT NOT TO BE ENTIRELY OMITTED
NAY HER OWN REASON TOLD HER THAT SOLEMN VOWS OF EVERY KIND OUGHT TO BE SACRED
BUT HE COULD NOT DO LESS NOR MORE REPLIED SHE
AND EVEN THREATENED HER INVALID WITH SOMETHING WORSE A VISIT FROM LORD MARGRAVE IF SHE CONTINUED OBSTINATE
TO RESEMBLE HER I BELIEVE IS ABOVE YOUR ABILITY THIS WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR COMPOSEDLY--AND POOR MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS GENERALLY A WITNESS OF THESE CONTROVERSIES FELT A DEGREE OF SORROW AT EVERY SENTENCE WHICH LIKE THE FOREGOING CHAGRINED AND DISTRESSED HER FRIEND
THEY REPLIED NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE AT HOME TO DINNER I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE HE DINES SAID SANDFORD
MISS WOODLEY WHO COULD EASILY DISCOVER A VIRTUE ALTHOUGH OF THE MOST DIMINUTIVE KIND AND SCARCE THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING GLASS OF CALUMNY COULD EVER PERCEIVE A FAULT WAS MISS MILNER'S INSEPARABLE COMPANION AT HOME AND HER ZEALOUS ADVOCATE WITH DORRIFORTH WHENEVER DURING HER ABSENCE SHE BECAME THE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE
WILL YOU ACCEPT OF MY SPECIFIC FOR THE HEAD-ACHE
SHE HAS A GREAT SHARE OF SPRIGHTLINESS--AND I THINK I NEVER SAW HER IN BETTER SPIRITS THAN SHE WAS THIS EVENING MY LORD LORD ELMWOOD DID NOT SPEAK
AND WHENEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED HE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAIN HIS ANGER
HAPPY YOUNG MAN CRIED MATILDA
SHE WAS REJOICED ON HEARING HIS VOICE AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR YET THE SOUND MADE HER TREMBLE SO MUCH THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY TOTTER TO THE TABLE
YET IN HIS COUNTENANCE REMAINED A PERFECT REMEMBRANCE OF IT WITHOUT ONE TRAIT OF COMPASSION FOR HIS HELPLESS NEPHEW
DO NOT DOOM ME TO THE LATTER WHETHER THE HEART OF MATILDA SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED COULD SENTENCE HIM TO MISERY THE READER IS LEFT TO SURMISE--AND IF HE SUPPOSES THAT IT COULD NOT HE HAS EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THEIR WEDDED LIFE WAS--A LIFE OF HAPPINESS
YOU HAVE A GREATER RESEMBLANCE OF YOUR FATHER MISS MILNER THAN I IMAGINED YOU HAD FROM REPORT
HE REPLIED BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT A PLAIN MAN YOU SHALL FIND ME IN ALL MY ACTIONS THEN YOUR ACTIONS ARE TO CONTRADICT YOUR APPEARANCE FOR IN WHAT SHE SAID MISS MILNER HAD THE QUALITY PECULIAR TO WITS OF HAZARDING THE THOUGHT THAT FIRST OCCURS WHICH THOUGHT IS GENERALLY TRUTH
FOR THE REST SHE PASSED HER LIFE AMONG ACTOR-MANAGERS AND HUMBLE PLAYWRIGHTS AND UNREMEMBERED MEDICAL MEN
YET NO SOONER WAS IT FINISHED THAN HIS THOUGHTS DESCENDED TO THIS WORLD
FOR ALTHOUGH I AM NOT OF A SUSPICIOUS NATURE YET IN REGARD TO HER AFFECTIONS FOR HIM I CANNOT BUT STILL HAVE MY DOUBTS YOU NEED HAVE NONE MY LORD REPLIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A SMILE OF CONFIDENCE
COME GIVE ME COMMISSION TO REVEAL YOUR PARTIALITY
VERY WELL REPLIED HE
SANDFORD NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PATRON'S APPARENTLY KIND HUMOUR WAS SHOCKED AT THE CONSTRUCTION HE MUST PUT UPON HER APPEARANCE AND CRIED WHAT MISS WOODLEY ARE YOU NOT RECOVERED OF YOUR ILLNESS YET LORD ELMWOOD HOWEVER TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER LOOKS BUT AFTER WISHING HER HER HEALTH WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE HOUSE
IN THE MEAN TIME LORD ELMWOOD AND RUSHBROOK WERE PROCEEDING ON THE ROAD WITH HEARTS NOT LESS HEAVY THAN THOSE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT AT ELMWOOD HOUSE
I WISH I HAD NOT COME HOME YET MISS WOODLEY WAS IN AGONY--SHE SAW LORD ELMWOOD'S EXTREME DISPLEASURE AND DREADED LEST HE SHOULD EXPRESS IT BY SOME WORDS HE COULD NOT RECALL OR SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE--THEREFORE WHISPERING TO HER SHE HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY SHE TOOK HER OUT OF THE ROOM
I LOVE HER FATHER--I LOVED HER MOTHER MORE--BUT I LOVE HER BEYOND EITHER HOLD YOUR LICENTIOUS TONGUE CRIED SANDFORD OR QUIT THE ROOM LICENTIOUS
THUS DID SHE MUSE WHILE THE CAUSE OF HIS DEJECTION THOUGH A MOST SERIOUS ONE AND PATHETICALLY DESCRIBED BY MISS WOODLEY SCARCE ARRESTED HER ATTENTION ONCE
BEAUTIFUL AS SHE HAD APPEARED TO MISS WOODLEY AND TO DORRIFORTH ON THE PRECEDING DAY WHEN SHE JOINED THEM THIS MORNING AT BREAKFAST RE-POSSESSED OF HER LIVELY ELEGANCE AND DIGNIFIED SIMPLICITY THEY GAZED AT HER AND AT EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY WITH ASTONISHMENT!--AND MRS HORTON AS SHE SAT AT THE HEAD OF HER TEA-TABLE FELT HERSELF BUT AS A MENIAL SERVANT
AS LORD ELMWOOD WAS INEXORABLE TO ALL ACCOMMODATION THEIR ENGAGEMENT CONTINUED FOR A LONG SPACE OF TIME
HE APPEARED HOWEVER AT TIMES UNDER THE APPREHENSION THAT THE PROPENSITY OF MAN TO JEALOUSY MIGHT GIVE RUSHBROOK A PANG AT THIS DANGEROUS RIVAL IN HIS LOVE AND FORTUNE--FOR THOUGH LORD ELMWOOD REMEMBERED WELL THE HAZARD HE HAD ONCE VENTURED TO BEFRIEND MATILDA YET THE PRESENT UNLIMITED RECONCILIATION WAS SOMETHING SO UNLOOKED FOR IT MIGHT BE A TRIAL TOO MUCH FOR HIS GENEROSITY TO REMAIN WHOLLY DISINTERESTED ON THE EVENT
AND FROM THE AMPLE VENGEANCE HE HAD OBTAINED UPON THE IRRESISTIBLE PERSON OF THE DUKE IN A SHORT TIME SEEMED TO REGAIN HIS USUAL TRANQUILLITY
SOME COXCOMBS OTHERS MEN OF GALLANTRY SOME SINGLE AND OTHERS MARRIED DORRIFORTH STARTED
AND THE LAST LINE IN WHICH GIFFARD SAID HE KNEW HIS LORDSHIP LOVED HER SHE THOUGHT REPAID HER FOR THE PURPORT OF THE OTHER PART
AT LEAST WE WILL PART ON GOOD TERMS SAID HE--"INDEED MY REGARD FOR HER IS SUCH I CANNOT PART OTHERWISE SHE SOON DISCERNED HIS RETURNING KINDNESS AND IT WAS A GENTLE TIE THAT WOULD HAVE FASTENED HER TO THAT SPOT FOR EVER BUT FOR THE FIRM RESISTANCE OF MISS WOODLEY
LORD ELMWOOD NOW CHEERFUL AND COMPLAINING NO MORE OF THE HEAD-ACHE
AND HERE IS MRS HILLGRAVE CONTINUED SHE--"I BELIEVE MRS HILLGRAVE YOU KNOW MISS MILNER DON'T YOU
MISS MILNER ASKED INQUISITIVELY WHAT SHE SAID THE MAID REPLIED SOFTLY LORD ELMWOOD MADAM WISHES TO COME AND SEE YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS IF YOU WILL ALLOW HIM AT THIS REPLY MISS MILNER STARED WILDLY
A LETTER FROM GIFFARD LORD ELMWOOD'S HOUSE STEWARD TO MISS WOODLEY MADAM MY LORD ABOVE A TWELVEMONTH AGO ACQUAINTED ME HE HAD PERMITTED HIS DAUGHTER TO RESIDE IN HIS HOUSE
STIMULATED HOWEVER BY HIS FRIENDS TO ONE MORE TRIAL IN SPITE OF THE FORMAL DISMISSION HE HAD TWICE RECEIVED HE INTRUDED ANOTHER VISIT ON LADY MATILDA AT THE FARM
MISS MILNER PLAYED ONE CARD FOR ANOTHER
SHE WHO COULD AND WHO DID PARDON MISS MILNER WAS THE PERSON WHO SAW HER PASSION IN THE SEVEREST LIGHT AND RESOLVED UPON EVERY METHOD HOWEVER HARSH TO ROOT IT FROM HER HEART--NOR DID SHE FEAR SUCCESS RESTING ON THE CERTAIN ASSURANCE THAT HOWEVER DEEP HER LOVE MIGHT BE FIXED IT WOULD NEVER BE RETURNED
AM NOT I DISAPPOINTED OF THE BALL YOU DON'T MEAN TO GO THEN SAID MRS HORTON
YET HE TOOK HER HAND AND HELD IT CLOSELY BETWEEN HIS
AND THE CONFIDENCE IN WHICH I NOW ADDRESS MYSELF TO THEE ENCOURAGED BY THAT LONG INTERCOURSE WHICH RELIGION HAS EFFECTED REPAYS ME AMPLY IN THIS ONE MOMENT FOR THE MANY YEARS OF MY PAST LIFE DEVOTED WITH MY BEST THOUGH IMPERFECT EFFORTS TO THY SERVICE CHAPTER XIV
WHEN HE DID HE BOWED WITH REVERENCE AS IF LEAVING THE PRESENCE OF A DEITY AND RETIRED
AND YET EVEN THAT LITTLE WHICH I KNOW TELLS ME WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY PLEADING FOR LORD FREDERICK'S LIFE WAS THE RESULT OF THE MOST VIOLENT AND TENDER LOVE THE LITTLE YOU KNOW THEN MR DORRIFORTH HAS DECEIVED YOU
THEY ALL RODE BACK REJOICING AT THEIR SECOND THOUGHTS AND LEFT HIM TO PURSUE HIS JOURNEY AND PROVE HIS VALOUR BY HIMSELF
DEJECTED THOUGHT SHE WHAT DOES THAT WORD EXACTLY MEAN?--DID I EVER SEE MR DORRIFORTH DEJECTED?--HOW I WONDER DOES HE LOOK IN THAT STATE
HE SEEMED TO FLY LADIES THE DINNER IS WAITING CRIED MRS HORTON AND THEY REPAIRED TO THE DINING ROOM WHERE DORRIFORTH SOON AFTER CAME AND ENGROSSED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION BY HIS DISTURBED LOOKS AND UNUSUAL SILENCE
IT IS MY OFFICE TO PROTECT HER FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEGRADING CHOICE AND I WILL MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE
RUSHBROOK WHO SUSPECTED WHERE SANDFORD WAS GONE AND IMAGINED HE WOULD RETURN THAT DAY TOOK HIS MORNING'S RIDE SO AS TO MEET HIM ON THE ROAD AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW MILES FROM THE CASTLE
HERE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SHE EARNED FOR HERSELF A MEAGRE LIVING UNTIL QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY DELIVERANCE CAME
BE THAT AS IT MAY LORD ELMWOOD COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THIS CHANGE AND ONE MORNING THOUGHT FIT TO MENTION AND TO APPLAUD IT
RUSHBROOK WHO HAD BEEN ALL THE MORNING ELATED WITH THE ADVANCE HE SUPPOSED HE HAD MADE IN THAT LADY'S FAVOUR WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED VEXED AND ANGRY WHEN THIS APOLOGY WAS DELIVERED
DO NOT CROWNED HEADS ALL MARRY FOREIGNERS
WHEN SHE CAME TO THAT SPOT ON THE STAIRS WHERE SHE HAD MET HER FATHER SHE STARTED BACK AND SCARCE KNEW HOW TO PASS IT
AND PERMIT ME TO CALL YOUR CARRIAGE SAYING THIS HE WENT HASTILY AND BECKONED TO THE COACHMAN
WHY WHAT MORE DO YOU KNOW NOTHING MORE THAN I HAVE TOLD YOU SIR
I WAS NOT EVEN THEN SO VERY MUCH THE OBJECT OF YOUR AFFECTIONS--THERE WERE OTHER LADIES YOU LOVED BETTER
AT THE TIME HIS DISORDER WAS AT THE HEIGHT AND HE LAY COMPLAINING OF THE VIOLENCE OF HIS FEVER LORD ELMWOOD TAKING HIS HAND ASKED HIM IF THERE WAS ANY THING HE COULD DO FOR HIM YES YES MY LORD A GREAT DEAL HE REPLIED EAGERLY
BUT HIS LIBERALITY HAD NO OTHER SOURCE THAN FROM HIS PATRON WITH WHOM HE STILL LIVED AS USUAL EXCEPT DURING PART OF THE WINTER WHEN THE EARL RESIDED IN TOWN
AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT REPLY DISTINCTLY SHE REPLIED WITHOUT WEEPING
MR RUSHBROOK SAID MISS WOODLEY THIS INTRUSION IS INSUPPORTABLE
THE MASQUERADE AT THE HONORABLE MRS G----'S THIS EVENING_'--THIS EVENING MY LORD YOU FIND--'_IT IS EXPECTED WILL BE THE MOST BRILLIANT OF ANY THING OF THE KIND FOR THESE MANY YEARS PAST THEY SHOULD NOT PUT SUCH THINGS IN THE PAPERS SAID MRS HORTON TO TEMPT YOUNG WOMEN TO THEIR RUIN THE WORD RUIN GRATED UPON LORD ELMWOOD'S EAR AND HE SAID TO THE SERVANT WHO CAME TO WAIT ON HIM WHILE HE SUPPED TAKE THE SUPPER AWAY HE HAD NOT ATTEMPTED EITHER TO EAT OR EVEN TO SIT DOWN
IT IS OFTEN HEAVY AND POMPOUS SOMETIMES CLUMSY AND INDISTINCT
I AM NOT GIVEN TO ALTER MY RESOLUTIONS MR SANDFORD
BUT MORE OF TAKING CHERRIES FROM HIS HAND AS HE PULLED THEM FROM THE TREE TO GIVE TO HER
NEVER SEE HER--BUT LET HER SOMETIMES LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH YOU
PROVOKED BEYOND BEARING AT SUCH UNFEELING ASSURANCE MATILDA REFUSED TO COME INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS AND MISS WOODLEY ALONE RECEIVED HIM AND EXPRESSED HER SURPRISE AT THE LITTLE ATTENTION HE HAD PAID TO HER EXPLICIT DESIRE
28 STOLE IT
IT ENDANGERS YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR HAPPINESS
BUT LORD ELMWOOD NOW DISGUSTED AT THE SCENE WITHDREW TO THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM AND LEFT SANDFORD TO QUESTION THEM
DORRIFORTH BORE ALL HE SAID WITH THE PATIENCE OF A DEVOTEE BUT WITH THE FIRMNESS OF A MAN
THE TEARS INSTANTLY COVERED HER FACE AND SHE LAID HER HANDS UPON HER HEART AS IF SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BREAK
SHE WAS TERRIFIED BEYOND DESCRIPTION
HE FELT THAT HE DESERVED ALL HE WAS GOING TO SUFFER AND HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES
SHE SOON RECOVERED
THAT SERENITY OF MIND WHICH KEPT HER FEATURES IN A CONTINUAL PLACID FORM THOUGH ENCHANTING AT THE FIRST GLANCE UPON A SECOND OR THIRD FATIGUED THE SIGHT FOR WANT OF VARIETY
HOWEVER WHAT IS IT PERMIT ME TO SPEAK TO YOU UPON THE SUBJECT OF LADY MATILDA SANDFORD MADE NO ANSWER CONSEQUENTLY DID NOT FORBID HIM--AND HE PROCEEDED
AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM THAT I SHALL NEVER ENTER A HOUSE IN WHICH YOU ARE THE MISTRESS NOR ANY HOUSE I AM CERTAIN MR SANDFORD BUT IN WHICH YOU ARE YOURSELF THE MASTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN MADAM
YET THOUGH MISS MILNER AT THOSE TIMES WAS SOFTENED INTO MELANCHOLY SHE BY NO MEANS APPEARED UNHAPPY
BUT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PERIOD RESENTMENT FLEW TO MISS MILNER'S FACE AND SHE DARTED A PIERCING LOOK AT MR SANDFORD WHICH MORE POINTEDLY EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM THAN IF SHE HAD SPOKEN VOLUMES IN HER USUAL STRAIN OF RAILLERY
IT WAS NOT WITH SANDFORD AS IT HAD LATELY BEEN WITH RUSHBROOK UNDER THE DISPLEASURE OF LORD ELMWOOD--TO THE LATTER HE BEHAVED AS SOON AS THEIR DISSENSION WAS PAST AS IF IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED--BUT TO SANDFORD IT WAS OTHERWISE--THE RESENTMENT WHICH HE HAD REPRESSED AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENCE LURKED IN HIS HEART AND DWELT UPON HIS MIND FOR SEVERAL DAYS
BUT BY THE AIR OF SINCERITY WITH WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED SHE WAS CONVINCED HER RECENT BEHAVIOUR TO LORD FREDERICK WAS BUT THE MERE EFFECT OF CHANCE
BUT IF HER GHOST LINGERS ANYWHERE IT IS NOT IN KENSINGTON
YET IN THE STATE OF HUMAN PERFECTION AND HUMAN HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT HAVE FIXED YOUR AFFECTIONS WITH PERHAPS LESS PROPRIETY
IMMOVEABLY FIXED MY LORD
I AM TO DINE AT MR FENTON'S TO-DAY HE REPLIED
AS WE SHALL BE OFF BY SIX OR SOON AFTER SANDFORD WAS NOT GOING ABROAD WITH LORD ELMWOOD BUT WAS TO GO WITH HIM AS FAR AS DOVER
BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE RULED--YOU WOULD NOT SEE CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR NOT SEEING REPLIED HIS LORDSHIP WHEN YOU WERE BLIND
YOU WISH HIM WELL
MATILDA TOO WAS CHEERED BY THIS LETTER FOR SHE EXPECTED SOMETHING WORSE
BUT FOR SOME TIME BEFORE RUSHBROOK WAS CALLED TO THIS PRIVATE AUDIENCE HE HAD BY HIS UNWEARIED ATTENTION ENDEAVOURED TO IMPRESS UPON MATILDA'S MIND THE SOFTEST SENTIMENTS IN HIS FAVOUR
DO YOU SUPPOSE HE DOES NOT I SUPPOSE THAT HE DOES YET I DON'T KNOW IT THEN IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE DOES HOW CAN YOU HAVE THE IMPRUDENCE TO FIND FAULT WITH HER BEFORE HIM I DID NOT
BUT NOT OBSERVING IT WAS HE SHE GRASPED HIS HAND WITH VIOLENCE--YET HE DID NOT SNATCH IT AWAY NOR LOOK AT HER WITH HIS WONTED SEVERITY
BUT IN APPARENTLY GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS HE COULD NOT FORM HIS LIPS TO TELL HIM HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL MATILDA WHO FOR FIVE MONTHS HAD BEEN AT LARGE SECLUDED HERSELF AS SHE WOULD HAVE DONE UPON THE ARRIVAL OF LORD ELMWOOD
FOR UPON HER PENETRATION THAT EVENING ALL HER FUTURE PROSPECTS SHE THOUGHT DEPENDED
AND HIS FRIENDLY SOCIETY THEY NOT ONLY ESTEEMED A SPIRITUAL BUT A TEMPORAL ADVANTAGE AS THE LIBERAL STIPEND HE ALLOWED FOR HIS APARTMENTS AND BOARD ENABLED THEM TO CONTINUE IN THE LARGE AND COMMODIOUS HOUSE WHICH THEY HAD OCCUPIED DURING THE LIFE OF MR HORTON
HE APPLAUDED HIS PUPIL'S VIRTUE IN MAKING THE DISCOVERY AND CONGRATULATED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF SAVING NOT ONLY HIS FRIEND'S LIFE BUT OF PREVENTING THE SCANDAL OF HIS BEING ENGAGED IN A DUEL
ALAS
ALAS
FOR HE FEARED THAT MR DORRIFORTH WOULD NOW THROW HIMSELF UPON THE SWORD OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT A SINGLE FRIEND NEAR TO DEFEND HIM A REBUKE FROM THE EYE OF MISS WOODLEY WHICH FROM THIS DAY HAD A COMMAND OVER MISS MILNER RESTRAINED HER FROM EXPRESSING THE AFFRIGHT SHE SUFFERED FROM THIS INTIMATION
AND STARING ANXIOUSLY IN HIS FACE SEEMED TO ENQUIRE OF HIM SOMETHING ABOUT LORD ELMWOOD AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT ALARM HER
FOR HE HAD MUCH RATHER HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE PIERCING CRIES OF A FEMALE IN THE LAST AGONIES OF DISTRESS THAN THE FATIGUE OF HER SENTIMENTAL HARANGUES OR ELEGANT REPROOFS SUCH AS HE HAD THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND BUT NOT THE CAPACITY TO ANSWER
MISS WOODLEY LOOKED AT HER AS SHE ENTERED AND WAS NEVER SO SHOCKED AT SEEING HER
AND THIS REFERENCE TO THE STEWARD SHE RECEIVED WITH THE UTMOST SATISFACTION THOUGH SHE DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO APPLY TO HIM AS IT PERFECTLY CONVINCED HER OF THE FOLLY OF THE SUSPICIONS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED
NOR SHOULD I DARE TO OFFER YOU EVEN THIS HUMBLE PETITION BUT THAT AT THE TIME YOU RECEIVE IT THERE WILL BE NO SUCH PERSON AS I AM IN EXISTENCE
BECAUSE IT SHEWED A DOUBLE SHARE OF INGRATITUDE TO THE DIVINE CREATOR OF THAT BEAUTY NOW YOU TALK OF ANGELS SAID MISS MILNER I WISH I HAD WINGS
IN WHAT DRESS DO YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW YOUR LADY WHEN YOU ATTENDED AND WENT ALONG WITH HER TO THE MASQUERADE IN MEN'S CLOTHES REPLIED THE MAN BOLDLY AND FIRMLY AS BEFORE
BUT MATILDA LAID FAST HOLD OF HER TO PREVENT THE POSTURE SHE OFFERED TO TAKE AND INSTANTLY ASSUMED IT HERSELF
HE COULD HARDLY SPEAK TO LORD ELMWOOD
AND WHILE THE VISCOUNT'S PENETRATION SMALL AS IT WAS DISCOVERED IN HIS FAIR ONE MORE TO DISCOURAGE THAN TO FAVOUR HIS WISHES
MISS MILNER HAD A HEART AFFECTIONATE TO HER OWN SEX EVEN WHERE SHE SAW THEM IN POSSESSION OF SUPERIOR CHARMS
THIS APPREHENSION OF OFFENDING WITHOUT ONE HOPE OF PLEASING HAD THE MOST AWKWARD EFFECT UPON THE MANNERS OF THE WORTHY BARONET
YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART YOU ARE ONLY ENVIOUS BECAUSE MY LORD ELMWOOD HAS NOT OFFERED HIMSELF TO YOU TO HER SAID SANDFORD AFFECTING AN AIR OF THE UTMOST SURPRISE
LOVE A RAKE A MAN OF PROFESSED GALLANTRY
THE CERTAIN END THAT WOULD BE SO SOON PUT TO THIS PAINFUL DECEPTION ENCOURAGED HER TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT WITH REDOUBLED ZEAL
OFTEN MERELY TO HASTEN ON THE TEDIOUS HOURS THAT INTERVENED SHE VARIED AND DIVERTED THEM WITH THE MANY RECREATIONS HER INTENDED HUSBAND COULD NOT APPROVE
MR SANDFORD FINDING HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH FREQUENTLY PERPLEXED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS WARD AND HE HIMSELF THINKING HER INCORRIGIBLE GAVE HIS COUNSEL THAT A SUITABLE MATCH SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT OUT FOR HER AND THE CARE OF SO DANGEROUS A PERSON GIVEN INTO OTHER HANDS
AND YET SAID SHE I HAVE AT LAST FIXED UPON A VERY PLAIN ONE
WHERE RUSHBROOK STILL REMAINED AND FROM WHENCE HIS LORDSHIP HAD MERELY COME BY ACCIDENT TO LOOK OVER SOME WRITINGS WHICH HE WANTED DISPATCHED TO TOWN
BUT NOW IT WAS FIXED TO A DEGREE WHICH HER EXTRAORDINARY MANNER ONLY COULD OCCASION
IN VAIN FOR THREE LONG DAYS DID MISS MILNER WAIT IMPATIENTLY FOR THIS SUBMISSION
IT WAS HOWEVER A SUBJECT HE SEEMED CAREFULLY TO AVOID SPEAKING UPON
BUT THOUGH HE KNEW THE TIME HE DID NOT KNOW THE EXACT PLACE OF THEIR APPOINTMENT FOR THAT LORD ELMWOOD HAD FORGOT TO ENQUIRE
COULD ANY SUPERNATURAL POWER HAVE ENDOWED HER WITH THE MEANS AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE SHEWN TO HER THE ILLS THAT MUST ARISE FROM SUCH AN EFFECT OF HER CHARMS SHE HAD ASSUREDLY VIRTUE ENOUGH TO HAVE DECLINED THE CONQUEST
SANDFORD IN ORDER TO APPEASE HIM BOWED AND OFFERED TO WITHDRAW HOPING TO BE RECALLED
ALTHOUGH MISS MILNER HAD NOT FORESEEN ANY FATAL EVENT RESULTING FROM THE INDIGNITY OFFERED TO LORD FREDERICK YET SHE PASSED A NIGHT VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
MATILDA WHO HAD WEPT MOANED AND WATCHED DURING THE CRISIS OF HIS ILLNESS WHEN SHE HEARD HE WAS AMENDING EXCLAIMED WITH A KIND OF SURPRISE AT THE NOVELTY OF THE SENSATION AND THIS IS JOY THAT I FEEL
EACH
MR GRIFFITH WAS ENCOURAGING AND THOUGH NO DEFINITE STEPS WERE TAKEN SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY CHARMED WITH HIM TO WRITE OUT HIS NAME AT LENGTH IN HER DIARY WITH THE INSCRIPTION EACH DEAR LETTER OF THY NAME IS HARMONY WAS MR GRIFFITH THE HERO OF THE COMPANY AS WELL AS ITS MANAGER
THAT AT ANY RATE WAS CLEARLY MISS SIMPSON'S OPINION
AFRAID OF BEING SURPRISED OR AFFECTED BY THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH INTO ANY PROMISES WHICH HE MIGHT HEREAFTER FIND THE IMPROPRIETY OF GRANTING
NEITHER DID MISS WOODLEY REGRET THE WANT OF VISITORS BUT FOUND HERSELF FAR MORE SATISFIED IN HER PRESENT SITUATION THAN HER MOST SANGUINE HOPES COULD HAVE FORMED
BUT NEW DIFFICULTIES AROSE HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THE END FOR WHICH HE CAME
BUT AS SHE ENTERED HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND DREW HER TO HIM
A SERVANT ENTERED
NO LORD FREDERICK APPEARS
IN HER SECOND LETTER TO MISS WOODLEY SHE PRAYED LIKE A PERSON INSANE TO BE TAKEN HOME FROM CONFINEMENT AND LIKE A LUNATIC PROTESTED IN SENSIBLE LANGUAGE SHE HAD NO DISORDER BUT HER FRIEND REPLIED THAT VERY DECLARATION PROVES ITS VIOLENCE AND SHE ASSURED HER NOTHING LESS THAN PLACING HER AFFECTIONS ELSEWHERE SHOULD INDUCE HER TO BELIEVE BUT THAT SHE WAS INCURABLE
FOR HIS MANNERS NOT FROM DESIGN BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY TO HIMSELF HAD BEEN SOFTENED SINCE HE BECAME HER GUARDIAN BY THAT TENDER RESPECT WHICH HE HAD UNIFORMLY PAID TO THE OBJECT OF HIS PROTECTION
IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT
MRS HORTON IN A LITTLE TIME WENT TO HERS
I SHALL CALL TO-MORROW ANSWERED LORD ELMWOOD
NEVER EVEN NOW FOR A MOMENT DID HE INDULGE--FOR PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INDULGENCE--THE IDEA OF REPLACING HER EXACTLY IN THE RIGHTS OF HER BIRTH TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF ALL HIS NEPHEW'S EXPECTATIONS
BUT THEN WHY ENCOURAGE HIM TO FOLLOW YOU HITHER MISS MILNER WHY COMMIT A THOUSAND FOLLIES SHE REPLIED IN TEARS EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE YOU THEN PROMOTE THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT ONE SERIOUS INTENTION OF COMPLETING THEM
WHAT MEANS THIS CHANGE SAID HE
AMONG THE MANY CAUSES OF COMPLAINT WHICH SHE GAVE HIM WANT OF OECONOMY IN THE DISPOSAL OF HER INCOME WAS ONE
AND I NOW FIRMLY BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE WELFARE OF YOU BOTH TO BECOME MAN AND WIFE
AS SHE ENTERED THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE THIS SENSATION INCREASED--AND AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE SPACIOUS HALL THE SPLENDID STAIRCASE AND MANY STATELY APARTMENTS WONDER WITH A CROWD OF THE TENDEREST YET MOST AFFLICTING SENTIMENTS RUSHED TO HER HEART
UPON THIS SERIOUS AND CERTAIN CONCLUSION TO THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK DORRIFORTH WAS MORE ASTONISHED THAN EVER AT THE CONDUCT OF HIS WARD
SHE HOWEVER FLATTERED HERSELF THAT WHAT SHE HAD SAID MIGHT BE EXCUSED AS A MISTAKE THE LAPSE OF MEMORY OR SOME OTHER TRIFLING FAULT WHEN HE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH
MR SANDFORD WHATEVER HAS BEEN YOUR OPINION OF ME I TAKE PRIDE TO MYSELF THAT IN MY SENTIMENTS TOWARDS YOU I HAVE ALWAYS DISTINGUISHED YOU FOR THAT HUMANE DISINTERESTED CHARACTER YOU HAVE THIS DAY PROVED HUMANE AND DISINTERESTED REPLIED SANDFORD ARE FLATTERING EPITHETS INDEED FOR AN OLD MAN GOING OUT OF THE WORLD AND WHO CAN HAVE NO TEMPTATION TO BE OTHERWISE THEN SUFFER ME TO CALL YOUR ACTIONS GENEROUS AND COMPASSIONATE FOR THEY HAVE SAVED ME I KNOW YOUNG MAN CRIED SANDFORD INTERRUPTING HIM YOU ARE GLAD AT WHAT I HAVE DONE AND THAT YOU FIND A GRATIFICATION IN TELLING ME YOU ARE
SHE NO LONGER APPLAUDED HER SCHEME OF BRINGING LORD FREDERICK TO THE HOUSE AND TREMBLED LEST ON SOME PRETENCE HE SHOULD DARE TO CALL AGAIN
MISS MILNER HAS BEEN ALMOST OVERTURNED BY THE CARELESSNESS OF A LADY'S COACHMAN IN WHOSE CARRIAGE SHE WAS AND THEREFORE SUFFERED ME TO BRING HER HOME IN MINE I HOPE YOU ARE NOT HURT SAID LORD ELMWOOD TO MISS MILNER BUT HIS VOICE WAS SO MUCH AFFECTED BY WHAT HE FELT THAT HE COULD SCARCE ARTICULATE THE WORDS
BUT FACTS ARE GLARING
HER HEART JUST THEN MELTING WITH TENDERNESS TO ANOTHER WAS PERHAPS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN HERETOFORE
22 SAW MR GRIFFITH'S PICTURE
I CANNOT SEE HIM TURNED OUT OF YOUR HOUSE WITHOUT FEELING FOR HIM WHAT HE ONCE FELT FOR ME LORD ELMWOOD TURNED ASIDE TO CONCEAL HIS SENSATIONS--THEN RAISING HER FROM THE FLOOR HE SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS ASKED OF ME NO ANSWERED SHE IN THE UTMOST IGNORANCE AND WITH THE UTMOST INNOCENCE PAINTED ON HER FACE
BUT IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF ON OUR ARRIVAL ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE PRECIPITATE HE SHOULD PLACE HER AGAIN WITH MISS WOODLEY AT A DISTANCE TO THIS FORCIBLE CONJECTURE THEY SUBMITTED FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN MOST GLADLY SET OUT FOR TOWN
MISS WOODLEY HOWEVER ASSURED HIM SHE BELIEVED HE WOULD HAVE NO CAUSE FOR SUCH A COMPLAINT AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD MADE THE MOST SOLEMN PROMISE NEVER TO COMMIT THE LIKE OFFENCE
AT LENGTH HE TURNED TOWARDS HER AND SAID APPEAL TO YOUR FATHER IN SOME OTHER FORM--IN THAT POINTING AT HER DRESS HE WILL NOT KNOW YOU
MRS HORTON BEGAN TO MAKE TEA WITH A MIND AS INTENT UPON SOMETHING ELSE AS DORRIFORTH'S--SHE LONGED FOR THE EVENT OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING
AND WHOSE HAPPINESS WAS MORE DEAR TO HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS FAULTS THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON
AND NOW HER THOUGHTS WERE ALL PLEASINGLY EMPLOYED HOW SHE SHOULD RENDER NOT ONLY THE LADY HERSELF BUT EVEN ALL HER ATTENDANTS HAPPY IN THEIR NEW SITUATION
1794
LADY ELMWOOD WHO WAS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE MINUTEST CIRCUMSTANCE AS IT PASSED APPEARED TO WAIT THE NEWS OF HER HUSBAND'S DECEASE WITH PATIENCE
YOU MAY REMEMBER HOW TROUBLESOME IT WAS TO CONQUER MY STUBBORN DISPOSITION IN MY YOUTH
AND SHALL I LIVE TO SLEEP UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH MY FATHER MY DEAR REPLIED MISS WOODLEY HAVE NOT YOU BEEN TOLD SO YES SAID SHE BUT THOUGH I HEARD IT WITH EXTREME PLEASURE YET THE IDEA NEVER SO FORCIBLY AFFECTED ME AS AT THIS MOMENT
BUT STILL HIS COUNTENANCE CONTINUED FIXED WITH HIS UNVARIED RESOLVES
FOR SHE SUPPOSED THIS TUMULT WAS SOME EXPERIMENT TO INTIMIDATE HER INTO SUBMISSION
I COULD NOT SLEEP--AND HAVING SOME PAPERS TO LOOK OVER AND TO SET OFF EARLY I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL NOT GO TO BED AT ALL MISS WOODLEY WAS PLEASED AT THE FRANK MANNER IN WHICH HE MADE THIS CONFESSION AND COULD NOT RESIST THE STRONG IMPULSE TO SAY YOU HAVE DONE JUST THEN MY LORD LIKE MISS MILNER FOR SHE HAS NOT BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT MISS WOODLEY SPOKE THIS IN A NEGLIGENT MANNER AND YET LORD ELMWOOD ECHOED BACK THE WORDS WITH SOLICITUDE HAS NOT MISS MILNER BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT IF SHE IS UP WHY DOES NOT SHE COME AND TAKE SOME COFFEE SAID SANDFORD AS HE BEGAN TO POUR IT OUT
BUT A DISCOURSE STILL LESS ADVANTAGEOUS TO POOR MISS MILNER
HAD HE COME PALE AND SICKLY SANDFORD HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM
BUT AS LADY ELMWOOD ANXIOUSLY WISHED THIS PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH SHE ACTED SHOULD BE CONCEALED FROM HIS SUSPICION SHE INCLUDED HER FRIEND MISS WOODLEY IN THE SAME FATE
RUSHBROOK WAS TOO PROUD TO SEEK TO CONCILIATE SANDFORD BY ABJECT CONCESSIONS BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO MEET HIM AS BY ACCIDENT AND MEANT TO TRY WHAT IN SUCH A CASE A SUBMISSIVE APOLOGY MIGHT EFFECT
PIQUED--HEART-BROKEN--FULL OF RESENTMENT AGAINST THE OBJECT OF HER UNEASINESS AND INATTENTIVE TO ALL THAT PASSED A HAND GENTLY TOUCHED HER OWN
YOU KNOW MY RESOLUTION MY DISPOSITION AND TAKE CARE HOW YOU PROVOKE ME
WHILE LORD ELMWOOD HAS BEEN AT HOME I HAVE KEPT AN AWFUL DISTANCE
MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY IN A TONE SO SOFT AND PEACEFUL THAT IT SHOULD HAVE CALMED THE RESENTMENT OF BOTH MY LORD SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ACCOMPANY MISS MILNER
HE FOLLOWED SAYING IN A LOW VOICE DEAR MISS WOODLEY HEAR ME AT THAT JUNCTURE LADY MATILDA WHO WAS IN AN INNER APARTMENT CAME OUT OF IT INTO MISS WOODLEY'S
TOOK BACK THEIR MONEY
AFTER HIS ENTRANCE LORD FREDERICK DID NOT ATTEMPT ONCE TO RESUME HIS SEAT BUT HAVING BOWED MOST RESPECTFULLY TO ALL PRESENT HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
MISS MILNER STRUGGLED TO LOOSE HER HAND SAYING EXCUSE ME FROM REPLYING TO YOU NOW MY LORD IN RETURN HE LIFTED HER HAND EAGERLY TO HIS LIPS AND BEGAN TO DEVOUR IT WITH KISSES
ALL THE RETORTS HE HAD UTTERED CAME NOW TO HIS MEMORY
AND YET EVEN A MOTHER CAN SCARCE CONCEIVE HOW MUCH MORE SHARP THOSE AGONIES WERE ON BEHOLDING--THE CHILD SENT AFTER HER AS THE PERPETUAL OUTCAST OF ITS FATHER
AND PRUDENCE HE CALLED IT NOT TO FORM ANOTHER ATTACHMENT NEAR TO HIS HEART MORE ESPECIALLY SO NEAR AS A PARENT'S WHICH MIGHT AGAIN EXPOSE HIM TO ALL THE TORMENTS OF INGRATITUDE FROM AN OBJECT WHOM HE AFFECTIONATELY LOVED
THE MOMENTS SEEMED TEDIOUS TILL HE CAME HOME TO SUPPER AND YET WHEN SHE REFLECTED HOW SHORT THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING WOULD BE AFTER THAT TIME SHE WISHED TO DEFER THE HOUR OF HIS RETURN FOR MONTHS
MISS WOODLEY WHO FOR SEVERAL WEEKS HAD TREATED HER FRIEND WITH A RIGIDNESS SHE HERSELF HARDLY SUPPOSED WAS IN HER NATURE NOW BEWAILED THAT SHE HAD DONE SO
SHE WOULD HAVE COME AWAY SOONER THAN SHE DID BUT SHE COULD NOT WITH ANY DEGREE OF GOOD MANNERS LEAVE THE COMPANY WITH WHOM SHE WENT
THEY HAVE BEEN RESIGNED THESE FIVE DAYS MY LORD I GIVE YOU JOY SAID MISS MILNER
A SIMPLE STORY CHAPTER I
BUT MISS MILNER PEREMPTORILY FORBADE THIS AND ACKNOWLEDGING TO HER FRIEND EVERY WEAKNESS SHE FELT ON THE OCCASION YET CONCLUDED WITH SOLEMNLY DECLARING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND LORD ELMWOOD HE MUST BE THE FIRST TO MAKE A CONCESSION BEFORE SHE HERSELF WOULD CONDESCEND TO BE RECONCILED I BELIEVE I KNOW LORD ELMWOOD'S TEMPER REPLIED MISS WOODLEY AND I DO NOT THINK HE WILL BE EASILY INDUCED TO BEG PARDON FOR A FAULT WHICH HE THINKS YOU HAVE COMMITTED THEN HE DOES NOT LOVE ME PSHAW
NEVERTHELESS ON THAT FIRST WEDDING-DAY THAT JOYFUL DAY WHICH RESTORED HER LOST LOVER TO HER HOPES AGAIN
AND EVEN AS HE RODE THE SHORT WAY TO LORD ELMWOOD'S IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE FOUND HIS OWN THOUGHTS WERE SO INSUFFERABLE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIS SERVANT
SANDFORD STILL MADE HIS OBSERVATIONS AND BEING UNUSED TO CONCEAL HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE THE PRESENT COMPANY HE SAID BLUNTLY MISS FENTON WAS INDISPOSED THE OTHER NIGHT MY LORD AND YOU DID NOT SEEM HALF THUS ANXIOUS ABOUT HER HAD SANDFORD LAID ALL LORD ELMWOOD'S ESTATE AT MISS MILNER'S FEET OR PRESENTED HER WITH THAT ETERNAL BLOOM WHICH ADORNS THE FACE OF A GODDESS HE WOULD HAVE DONE LESS TO ENDEAR HIMSELF TO HER THAN BY THIS ONE SENTENCE--SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A MOST BENIGN COUNTENANCE AND FELT AFFLICTION THAT SHE HAD EVER OFFENDED HIM
THERE IS BESIDES IN THE TEMPER OF MISS FENTON A SEDATENESS THAT MIGHT WITH LESS HAZARD ENSURE HER SAFETY IN AN UNMARRIED LIFE
I WILL SIR
THIS GENTLEWOMAN'S VISIT INSPIRED MR DORRIFORTH WITH SOME CONFIDENCE IN THE PRINCIPLES AND CHARACTER OF HIS WARD
HE STOLE OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT UTTERING A SYLLABLE--BUT AS HE NEVER RETIRED TO REST BEFORE HE HAD REPEATED A LONG FORM OF EVENING PRAYER WHEN THIS EVENING HE CAME TO THAT PART WHICH SUPPLICATES GRACE FOR THE WICKED HE MENTIONED MISS MILNER'S NAME WITH THE MOST FERVENT DEVOTION
AND YET PERHAPS WITH HIS THOUGHTS MORE ENGAGED UPON THE TRUST WHICH THAT FRIEND HAD REPOSED IN HIM
MISS WOODLEY WAITED ON LORD ELMWOOD AS FORMERLY
THIS INVITATION WAS TO BE LAID BEFORE DORRIFORTH FOR HIS APPROBATION AND THE TWO LADIES WERE TO ENFORCE IT BY EXPRESSING THEIR EARNEST WISHES FOR HIS CONSENT
SHE NOW BEGAN TO FEAR SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR IN DISCOVERING HER AFFECTION AND RESOLVED TO MAKE TRIAL OF A CONTRARY METHOD
LORD ELMWOOD WENT IMMEDIATELY INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE SANDFORD MISS WOODLEY AND MATILDA WERE SITTING AND CRIED WITH AN ANGRY VOICE AND WITH HIS COUNTENANCE DISORDERED RUSHBROOK HAS OFFENDED ME BEYOND FORGIVENESS.--GO SANDFORD TO THE LIBRARY WHERE HE IS AND TELL HIM THIS INSTANT TO QUIT MY HOUSE AND NEVER DARE TO RETURN MISS WOODLEY LIFTED UP HER HANDS AND SIGHED
AND MISS WOODLEY TO WHOM HE FIRST DECLARED THEM SAID EVERY THING POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE HIM OF THEIR FALLACY
AND FELT HER SPIRITS REVIVE BY THE SUPERIOR SUFFERINGS THAT AWAITED HER--FOR HER INCREASING TERRORS ROUSED HER FROM THE DEATH-LIKE WEAKNESS BROUGHT ON BY FATIGUE
TAKE HER THEN CRIED SANDFORD INTO THE COUNTRY AND IF LORD FREDERICK SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THERE IS AN END OF YOUR SUSPICIONS I SHALL NOT EASILY PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO LEAVE TOWN REPLIED HE WHILE IT IS IN THE HIGHEST FASHION YOU CAN BUT TRY RETURNED SANDFORD
AND I AM AFRAID SHE WILL PREPOSSESS YOU WITH THE SAME UNFAVOURABLE SENTIMENTS STILL MATILDA DID NOT SPEAK BUT LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE SAME AIR OF DIGNITY
DORRIFORTH THE PIOUS THE GOOD THE TENDER DORRIFORTH IS BECOME A HARD-HEARTED TYRANT
LORD ELMWOOD BY THIS TIME WAS COMPOSED AND RECEIVED HER WITH A SLIGHT INCLINATION OF HIS HEAD--SHE BOWED TO HIM IN RETURN AND SAID WITH SOME MARKS OF HUMILITY I SUPPOSE MY LORD I HAVE DONE WRONG YOU HAVE INDEED MISS MILNER ANSWERED HE
IT WAS IN VAIN HE TRIED
MISS MILNER TO DO JUSTICE TO HER HEART DID NOT WISH TO BEGUILE DORRIFORTH INTO THE SNARES OF LOVE
YET THE FERVENT AND SOLEMN MANNER IN WHICH HE MADE IT CHEERED HER SPIRITS
NAY IF WE DO QUARREL RESUMED LORD ELMWOOD YOU KNOW IT MUST BE YOUR OWN FAULT
ON WHICH HE OPENED HIS BOOK AND--MARRIED THEM
I HAVE SEEN GRAVE CHARACTERS THERE MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY
HE MAY LOVE YOU TOO WELL TO SPOIL YOU--CONSIDER THAT HE IS YOUR GUARDIAN AS WELL AS YOUR LOVER HE MEANS ALSO TO BECOME YOUR HUSBAND
RUSHBROOK AROSE AND FEELING IN HIS MIND A PRESAGE THAT HE MIGHT NEVER FROM THAT HOUR BEHOLD HIS BENEFACTOR MORE
HINT AT MY AFFECTIONS BEING ENGAGED BUT NOT TO WHOM
WITH ALL THESE SENTIMENTS CROWDING FAST UPON HIS HEART HE STILL READ OR SEEMED TO READ AS IF HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT WAS PASSING
ADDING SHE COULD NEVER BEAR WITH INDIFFERENCE AN UNJUST ACCUSATION TO PROVE THAT MINE WAS UNJUST MADAM REPLIED DORRIFORTH
AND UPON THOSE OCCASIONS MISS MILNER HAS SOMETIMES BROUGHT MISS WOODLEY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COULD MR DORRIFORTH HAVE POSSIBLY FORESEEN THE EARLY DEATH OF THE LAST LORD ELMWOOD IT HAD BEEN MORE FOR THE HONOUR OF HIS RELIGION AS THAT ANCIENT TITLE WOULD NOW AFTER HIM BECOME EXTINCT IF HE HAD PREFERRED MARRIAGE VOWS TO THOSE OF CELIBACY CHAPTER II
AND RISING FROM THE PLACE WHERE SHE SAT SHE CRIED WITH HER VOICE ELEVATED LEAVE ME MY LORD OR I'LL DIE IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR CARE
IF SHE BELONGS TO ANY SCHOOL IT IS AMONG THE FOLLOWERS OF THE FRENCH CLASSICAL TRADITION THAT SHE MUST BE PLACED
SHE HAD NO DOUBT WHO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS WICKEDNESS
HOWEVER MISS MILNER THIS AFFAIR WILL NOT BE SETTLED IMMEDIATELY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT ALL WILL BE AS YOU COULD WISH
THEY ARE WRITTEN IN A JARGON WHICH RESEMBLES IF IT RESEMBLES ANYTHING AN EXECRABLE PROSE TRANSLATION FROM VERY FLAT FRENCH VERSE
THE HEART TO USE THE OLD-FASHIONED PHRASE--THERE IS MRS INCHBALD'S EMPIRE THERE IS THE SPHERE OF HER GLORY AND HER COMMAND
BUT HE WAS NOT AN ILL-BRED MAN
HE ASKED THE SERVANTS SEVERAL TIMES WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE WENT OUT
AND WERE WE APART CONTINUAL APPREHENSIONS WOULD PREY UPON MY MIND THE TEAR STARTED IN HER EYE AT THE EARNESTNESS THAT ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS
I WILL GO TO MY FATHER
SHE NOW LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND LEANED IT ON HER HAND AS SHE SAT BY THE SIDE OF A TABLE--STILL SHE DID NOT SPEAK BUT SEEMED OVERCOME WITH SORROW
THAT SHE WOULD RING FOR HER MAID WHO KNEW HOW TO RELIEVE HER INSTANTLY WITH A FEW DROPS SATISFIED WITH THIS DORRIFORTH LEFT THE ROOM
AND HAD HE NOT SEEN DECLINE OF HEALTH IN THE LOOKS AND BEHAVIOUR OF LADY MATILDA HIS FELICITY HAD BEEN UNBOUNDED
MY LORD WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY FARTHER SAID MISS WOODLEY IN TEARS DEFER TILL THE MORNING--MISS MILNER YOU SEE IS NOT ABLE TO BEAR IT NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY FURTHER REPLIED HE COOLLY--"I HAVE NOW ONLY TO ACT LORD ELMWOOD CRIED MISS MILNER DIVIDED BETWEEN GRIEF AND ANGER YOU THINK TO TERRIFY ME BY YOUR MENACES--BUT I CAN PART WITH YOU--HEAVEN KNOWS I CAN--YOUR LATE BEHAVIOUR HAS RECONCILED ME TO A SEPARATION ON THIS HE WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM--BUT MISS WOODLEY CATCHING HOLD OF HIM CRIED OH
SHE DISLIKED HIM TOO AND THEREFORE SHE SUSPECTED HIM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ANXIETY AND TROUBLE UNDER WHICH MISS WOODLEY HAD LABOURED ALL THE MORNING HER HEART FOR MANY WEEKS HAD NOT FELT SO LIGHT AS IT DID THIS DAY AT DINNER
THE NEXT DAY WAS THE EVE OF THAT ON WHICH HE WAS TO DEPART--OF THE DAY ON WHICH SHE WAS TO BID ADIEU TO DORRIFORTH TO HER GUARDIAN TO LORD ELMWOOD
WHEN FROM INQUIRIES RUSHBROOK FOUND THAT ON HIS APPROACH MATILDA HAD RETIRED TO HER OWN CONFINED APARTMENTS THE THOUGHT WAS TORTURE TO HIM
THERE CAN BE NO FEAR OF MISTAKING MY MEANING
HE LAID HIS COMMANDS UPON HIM NOT TO GO A STEP FROM THE CASTLE
MISS WOODLEY COULD HARDLY SUPPORT THIS HUMBLE REFERENCE TO HER JUDGMENT FROM THE WAN FACE OF THE POOR INVALID AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND WHISPERED YOU SHALL DO WHAT YOU PLEASE IN A FEW MINUTES LORD ELMWOOD WAS INTRODUCED
MRS INCHBALD'S NOVEL IS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE WORLD AT LARGE OR WITH ANY SECTION OF SOCIETY HARDLY EVEN WITH THE FAMILY
THIS AROSE FROM A FAVOUR THAT HE HAD GRANTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER DESIRE THOUGH THAT DESIRE HAD NOT BEEN URGED BUT MERELY INSINUATED
BUT I AM A PROTESTANT YOU KNOW AND IF I HAD DIED SUCH DO YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HEAVEN MOST ASSUREDLY THAT WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED YOU BUT MR SANDFORD DOES NOT THINK SO HE MUST
MISS WOODLEY IS GROWN OLD BUT LESS WITH YEARS THAN GRIEF
WE BEGIN THIS VOLUME AND FIND HER UPON HER DEATH-BED
FORGETTING HIS AUSTERITY AND ALL SHE HAD ONCE TERMED CRUELTIES SHE NOW ONLY REMEMBERED HIS FRIENDSHIP HIS TENDERNESS AND HIS LOVE
THE FARMER UNCERTAIN WHO THIS FEMALE WAS YET WENT TO THE HOUSE SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM AS THE NEAREST WITH THE TALE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN
HA HA MY LORD HALF LAUGHING AND HALF CRYING A WOMAN'S DRESS TO BE SURE MY LORD ON WHICH SANDFORD CRIED CALL THE FOOTMAN UP AND LET HIM CONFRONT HER HE WAS CALLED
MRS INCHBALD CONQUERED HER INFIRMITY OF SPEECH AND THREW HERSELF INTO HER HUSBAND'S PROFESSION
FOR NEVER HAD SHE YET SEEN HER LOOK SO ILL
BUT STILL OF THAT SENSIBLE AND FEELING KIND THAT COULD NEVER SUFFER HIM TO FORGET THE HAPPINESS HE HAD LOST
ONCE SHE CALLED HIM CRUEL--THEN EXCLAIMED HE WAS KIND BUT AT THE END OF SANDFORD'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED THAT SHE WAS HAPPY AND GRATEFUL FOR THE BOON BESTOWED EVEN HER MOTHER HAD NOT A MORE EXALTED IDEA OF LORD ELMWOOD'S WORTH THAN HIS DAUGHTER HAD FORMED
YES RESUMED RUSHBROOK YOU THINK I AM WRONGING HER I THINK YOU INSULT HER EXCLAIMED SANDFORD BY THIS RUDE MENTION OF HER NAME
FOR LORD ELMWOOD STILL RETAINED ENOUGH OF THE SANCTITY OF HIS FORMER STATE TO HAVE YIELDED UP HIS OWN HAPPINESS AND EVEN THAT OF HIS BELOVED WARD RATHER THAN HAVE PLUNGED ONE HEART INTO AFFLICTION BY HIS PERFIDY
AFTER SOME MATURE DELIBERATIONS SANDFORD WAS NOW PREPARING TO GO TO LORD ELMWOOD AT HIS HOUSE IN TOWN AND THERE TO DELIVER HIMSELF THE NEWS THAT MUST SOONER OR LATER BE TOLD
SOMETIMES THE OLD PRIEST INCENSED BEYOND BEARING WAS ON THE POINT OF SAYING TO HIS PATRON HOW IN MY AGE DARE YOU THUS TREAT THE MAN WHOM IN HIS YOUTH YOU RESPECTED AND REVERED SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF ANGER HE FELT THE TEAR HE WAS ASHAMED TO OWN STEAL TO HIS EYE AND EVEN FALL DOWN HIS CHEEK
IF THERE ARE PRAY SEND FOR THEM BEFORE YOU BEGIN YOUR INTERROGATIONS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD--SHE CONTINUED
YES INDEED
CHAPTER V
CHAPTER V
CHAPTER V
CHAPTER V
BUT DO NOT MAKE YOUR VISIT LONG MR RUSHBROOK SHE CONTINUED FOR I WAS JUST THEN THINKING THAT SHOULD LORD ELMWOOD HEAR OF THIS ATTENTION YOU HAVE PAID ME IT MIGHT BE FATAL TO YOU HERE SHE WEPT AGAIN AS BITTERLY AS BEFORE
ALL THE DECLINING ENMITY OF MISS MILNER WAS RENEWED AT THIS BEHAVIOUR AND SUSPECTING SANDFORD AS THE INSTIGATOR OF THE VISIT SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME HER DISPLEASURE BUT GAVE WAY TO IT IN A MANNER SHE THOUGHT THE MOST MORTIFYING
BUT WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE THAT HIS CHEERFULNESS WAS AFFECTED
AND TO SHOW HE DID NOT WISH TO REMIND RUSHBROOK OF WHAT HE HAD DONE HE WAS JUST AS UNCIVIL AS EVER
REAL DELICATE AND RESTRAINED LOVE SUCH AS MISS MILNER'S WAS INDULGED IN THE SIGHT OF THE OBJECT ONLY
IN MY CALENDAR OF LOVE A SOLEMN LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OR A DEVOUT ARCHBISHOP RANKS BEFORE A LICENTIOUS KING MISS WOODLEY SMILED AT AN OPINION WHICH SHE KNEW HALF HER SEX WOULD RIDICULE
HAVING TAKEN THIS RESOLUTION HE LAID THE PLAN OF AN OPEN VIOLATION OF ALL RIGHT
IT IS SO CONTRARY TO MY DESERTS THAT I CANNOT BEAR IT SUSPICION OF YOUR INGRATITUDE!--YOU JUDGE TOO FAVOURABLY OF MY OPINION--IT AMOUNTS TO CERTAINTY THEN TO CONVINCE YOU SIR I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL TELL ME WHO THE LADY IS YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR ME AND HERE I GIVE YOU MY WORD I WILL SACRIFICE ALL MY FUTURE PROSPECTS OF HAPPINESS--ALL FOR WHICH I WOULD WISH TO LIVE--AND BECOME HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS YOU SHALL APPOINT THIS WAS SPOKEN WITH A TONE SO EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR THAT LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED AND WHILE YOU OBEY ME YOU TAKE CARE TO LET ME KNOW IT WILL COST YOU YOUR FUTURE PEACE
AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY YOU HATE ME CONTINUED HE
HER ATTENDANT FOR SOME TIME OBSERVED THE MOST REVERENTIAL AWE
AND SHE KNEW NOT HOW SHE SHOULD DARE TO SPEAK TO OR LOOK ON HIM WITH THAT FREEDOM HER AFFECTION WARRANTED
SANDFORD TOO FIXED HIS PENETRATING EYES UPON HER AS IF HE WOULD LOOK THROUGH HER SOUL BUT FINDING IT PERFECTLY COMPOSED HE CRIED OUT WHY THEN NOT WRITE HIS DISMISSION HERSELF AND SAVE YOU MR DORRIFORTH THE TROUBLE OF ANY FARTHER CONTEST WITH HIM INDEED MISS MILNER SAID DORRIFORTH THAT WOULD OBLIGE ME
NOW LOATHING HER FOR THE DECEPTION SHE HAD PRACTISED MORE THAN HAD SHE RECEIVED HER THUS AT FIRST MATILDA HID HER EYES FROM THE SIGHT OF HER
FLY SHE RESUMED AND PREVENT THE INEVITABLE ILL CONSEQUENCE WHICH WILL ENSUE IF LORD FREDERICK SHOULD BE TOLD THIS FALSEHOOD
AND HAVING URGED HIS REASONS WITH ARGUMENTS WHICH AT LEAST HE COULD NOT REFUTE HE WAS AT LENGTH PREVAILED UPON TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE FIELD WHICH WAS AT THE DISTANCE ONLY OF A FEW MILES AND THE PARTIES WERE TO BE THERE AT SEVEN ON THE SAME EVENING
SHE WOULD THEN DECLARE THAT SHE ONLY HAD ACTED THUS TO TRY THE GOOD MAN'S TEMPER AND THAT IF HE HAD COMBATED WITH HIS FRETFULNESS A FEW MOMENTS LONGER SHE WOULD HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS CLAIM TO CANONIZATION
THAT HE HAD FARTHER UTTERED THE SEVEREST THREATS SHOULD THESE RESTRICTIONS EVER BE INFRINGED
I DON'T BELIEVE UPON MY OWN UNDERSTANDING BUT FROM WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TELL ME AND LET THIS CONVINCE YOU REPLIED DORRIFORTH THAT WHAT WE TEACH IS TRUTH
AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE
NAY MR SANDFORD CRIED MISS MILNER I BELIEVE AFTER ALL MY WORST CRIME IN YOUR EYES IS THAT OF BEING A HERETIC BY NO MEANS--IT IS THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAN APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR FAULTS
SHE CERTAINLY PITIED HIM WHILE SHE THOUGHT OF HIM BUT SHE DID NOT THINK OF HIM LONG
THE JUST CONSTRUCTION SHE PUT UPON HIS LOOKS AND BEHAVIOUR UPON THIS OCCASION KEPT UP HER SPIRITS FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
SANDFORD SAW THIS YOUNG MAN TREATED IN THE HOUSE OF LORD ELMWOOD WITH THE SAME RESPECT AND ATTENTION AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS SON
OH FLY AND PREVENT MY GUARDIAN FROM TELLING HIM SUCH AN UNTRUTH WHAT CAN YOU MEAN REPEATED MISS WOODLEY
FROM WHENCE I PROPOSE PASSING TO THE WEST INDIES IN ORDER TO INSPECT MY POSSESSIONS THERE
VISCOUNT MARGRAVE HAD AN ESTATE NOT FAR DISTANT FROM THE RETREAT LADY ELMWOOD HAD CHOSEN
HER REPLIES HAD ALL THE EFFECT OF REPARTEE NOT BECAUSE SHE POSSESSED THOSE QUALITIES WHICH CAN PROPERLY BE CALLED WIT BUT THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS DELIVERED WITH AN ENERGY AN INSTANTANEOUS AND POWERFUL CONCEPTION OF THE SENTIMENT JOINED WITH A REAL OR A WELL-COUNTERFEITED SIMPLICITY A QUICK TURN OF THE EYE AND AN ARCH SMILE
IS IT NOT CRIED SHE STARTING UP AND LEANING ON HER ELBOW--"THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST GO AWAY--GO FOR EVER AWAY SANDFORD NOW ENTERED
MISS MILNER FOR THAT NIGHT DREAMED LESS OF HER GUARDIAN THAN OF THE MASQUERADE
MY LORD SAID HE BUT HE DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS TASK WITHOUT SUSTAINING THE TREMBLING AND CONVULSION OF HIS WHOLE FRAME MY LORD--WAVING FOR A MOMENT THE SUBJECT OF MY MARRIAGE--PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU THAT WHEN I WAS UPON MY SICK BED YOU PROMISED THAT ON MY RECOVERY YOU WOULD LISTEN TO A PETITION I SHOULD OFFER TO YOU LET ME RECOLLECT REPLIED HE
AWED THUS BY HIS POWER FROM EVERY THING BUT WHAT SHE REALLY WAS SHE NEVER WAS PERHAPS HALF SO BEWITCHING AS IN THOSE TIMID RESPECTFUL AND EMBARRASSED MOMENTS SHE PASSED ALONE WITH HIM
OF THOUGHTS FOR A FUTURE STATE
HE THEREFORE GRAVELY SAID TO HER ONE FORENOON AS HE MET HER ACCIDENTALLY UPON THE STAIRCASE I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME UNPREPARED FOR THE SUDDEN QUESTION SHE BLUSHED AND REPLIED YES."--THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS ENGAGED TO A BRILLIANT ASSEMBLY FOR WHICH HER MILLINER HAD BEEN CONSULTED A WHOLE WEEK
WHEN SHE CAME TO LADY MATILDA AND SANDFORD HAD JOINED THEM THEY TALKED AND DELIBERATED ON WHAT HAD PASSED
BUT LET HER LIVE UNDER HIS PROTECTION
BUT THE OBSCURITY OF MRS INCHBALD'S CAREER HAS NOT OF COURSE BEEN THE ONLY REASON FOR THE NEGLECT OF HER WORK
SHE WAS THE AUTHOR OF ONE OF THE BEST OF DIARIES
YET WHY SHE HAD DONE SO HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
AND IN THE MIDST OF HIS CHAGRIN AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT A SORROW LITTLE THOUGHT OF OCCURRED AND GAVE HIM A PERTURBATION OF MIND HE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
YOU WILL STAY WITHIN THEN ALL THIS DAY SAID MISS MILNER
AND BEFORE THE NEXT DAY AT NOON HIS PLEASANT HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE PARK HIS GARDEN AND HIS ORCHARD WHICH HE HAD OCCUPIED ABOVE TWENTY YEARS WERE CLEARED OF THEIR OLD INHABITANT AND ALL HIS WRETCHED FAMILY
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I NEVER SAW HIM IN BETTER SPIRITS THAT IS WELL SAID MATILDA AND SIGHED A WEIGHT OF FEARS FROM HER HEART
BUT WHATEVER IT IS MY LORD THOUGH YOU DO NOT GRANT IT YET PARDON HIM FOR ASKING PERHAPS YOU WOULD GRANT HIM WHAT HE HAS REQUESTED SAID HER FATHER
TO THE MESSAGE DELIVERED BY THIS GENTLEMAN HE REPLIED SIR AS A CLERGYMAN MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE CHURCH OF ROME I KNOW NOT WHETHER I AM NOT EXEMPT FROM ANSWERING A DEMAND OF THIS KIND
SHE PINCHED HER LIPS CLOSE TOGETHER AND CAST HER EYES ON VACANCY LEST THEIR SIGNIFICANT REGARDS MIGHT EXPOSE HER TO DETECTION
HE DISCOVERS HER SORROW AND IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE DEPARTURE OF LORD FREDERICK FROM THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY IS NOT THE CAUSE
EXPLAIN MADAM EXPLAIN DEAR MY LORD SAID SHE IF YOUR LORDSHIP WILL RECOLLECT YOU MAY JUST HAVE THE SAME KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE RECOLLECT WHAT SAID HE STERNLY
BUT WHILE SHE PAINTED THEM AS LOVERS THE TORTURES OF THE RACK ARE BUT A FEW DEGREES MORE PAINFUL THAN THOSE WHICH SHE ENDURED
SHE APPROACHED MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS STILL IN TEARS WITH SILENCE
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER INSTIGATION MORE POWERFUL THAN THE NECESSITY OF WALKING--IT WAS THE ALLUREMENT OF PASSING ALONG THAT PATH WHERE HE HAD LAST SEEN LADY MATILDA AND WHERE FOR THE ONLY TIME SHE HAD CONDESCENDED TO SPEAK TO HIM DIVESTED OF HAUGHTINESS
LEAVE MY HOUSE INSTANTLY AND SEEK SOME OTHER HOME JUST AS THESE WORDS WERE BEGUN SANDFORD OPENED THE LIBRARY DOOR WAS WITNESS TO THEM AND TO THE IMPLORING SITUATION OF RUSHBROOK
NOT EVEN SPARING THROUGH AN ERRONEOUS DELICACY ANY OF THOSE THREATS HER FATHER HAD DENOUNCED SHOULD SHE DARE TO TRANSGRESS THE LIMITS HE PRESCRIBED--NOR DID HE TRY TO SOFTEN IN ONE INSTANCE A WORD HE UTTERED
ALL WORLDLY VIEWS HERE THROWN ASIDE I ACT AS IF THAT TRIBUNAL BEFORE WHICH I EVERY MOMENT EXPECT TO APPEAR WERE NOW SITTING IN JUDGMENT UPON MY PURPOSE
UNEXPECTED AFFAIRS IN WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME ENGAGED HAD DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION FOR AWHILE FROM THE MARRIAGE OF HIS NEPHEW
FROM HER INFANCY SHE HAD BEEN INDULGED IN ALL HER WISHES TO THE EXTREME OF FOLLY AND STARTED HABITUALLY AT THE UNPLEASANT VOICE OF CONTROL
THEN JUMPED UPON THE STAGE
WHEN MISS WOODLEY TOOK HER LEAVE HE INVITED HER TO DINE WITH HIM AND SANDFORD WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HER
SHE SAW IN THIS LITTLE INCIDENT THE ART OF DISSIMULATION CUNNING AND DUPLICITY IN ITS MOST GLARING SHAPE
HE LOOKED GRAVE BEYOND HIS USUAL GRAVITY AND YET NOT WITH HIS USUAL ILL TEMPER
BUT WILLINGLY AND DELIBERATELY
AND THE YOUNG MAN VAINLY IMAGINED HIS INTENTIONS UPON THAT SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GIVEN UP
RUSHBROOK WAS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE SAME TIME
MISS WOODLEY WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO ROUSE HIM FROM THE DEJECTION INTO WHICH HE WAS CAST OR HE WOULD HAVE SUNK BENEATH IT
BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW TO PARDON A LOVER A RATIONAL ONE I DO--BUT YOU MY LORD ARE NOT OF THAT CLASS WHILE YOU PERSECUTE THE PRETENDED OBJECT OF YOUR AFFECTION DO YOU CALL IT PERSECUTION THAT I ONCE OFFERED HER A SHARE OF MY TITLE AND FORTUNE--AND EVEN NOW DECLARE MY FORTUNE IS AT HER DISPOSAL SANDFORD WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE UNDERSTOOD HIS MEANING--BUT LORD MARGRAVE PROVOKED AT HIS ILL RECEPTION FELT A TRIUMPH IN REMOVING HIS DOUBTS AND PROCEEDED THUS
I THEREFORE CONSULT YOUR OPINION UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH IT SHALL BE MADE MR DORRIFORTH CAN YOU ALLOW NOTHING TO THE MOMENTS OF SURPRISE AND THAT PITY WHICH THE FATE IMPENDING INSPIRED
LORD ELMWOOD WAS PREPARING TO GO ABROAD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING IN FORM THE DISPENSATION FROM HIS VOWS
HE IS BELOVED BY ALL THOSE WHOSE AFFECTION IT WOULD BE MY CHOICE TO POSSESS BEYOND ANY OTHER BLESSING THIS WORLD COULD BESTOW AND YET I QUESTION IF RUSHBROOK IS HAPPY SAID SANDFORD
BUT RETURNED WITH THE BOOK AGAIN AND LAYING IT ON THE TABLE WITHOUT SPEAKING WAS GOING AWAY
THE MUSIC WAS DISCORD--EVERY THING SHE SAW WAS DISGUSTING--IN A WORD SHE WAS MISERABLE
MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY LET BUT HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR ME STILL REMAIN AND I WILL CONSENT TO ANY THING
THUS DOES THE LOVER CONSIDER THE EXTINCTION OF HIS PASSION WITH THE SAME HORROR AS THE LIBERTINE LOOKS UPON ANNIHILATION
BUT IN THE CERTAINTY OF AN AMENDE HONORABLE WHICH MUST HEREAFTER BE MADE HE OVERCAME THE MANY TEMPTATIONS WHICH THE MOMENT OFFERED AND RE-MOUNTING HIS HORSE RODE AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF HIS DISGRACE
BUT NO DOUBT IT WAS THEIR FAULTS THAT MADE THEM POPULAR--THEIR SENTIMENTALITIES THEIR MELODRAMATIC ABSURDITIES THEIR STRANGELY FALSE AND HIGH-PITCHED MORAL TONE
BUT THE HOPE THAT PRIVILEGE INSPIRED WHILE HE STILL HARBOURED ALL THE JUST APPREHENSIONS FOR HIS FATE GAVE BIRTH PERHAPS TO A MORE EXQUISITE SENSATION OF PAIN THAN DESPAIR WOULD HAVE DONE
MISS WOODLEY WAS CAUTIOUS IN HER INDULGENCE
THEY ARE BOTH VERY WELL REPLIED SANDFORD AT LEAST THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN THEY WERE SICK THEY ARE NOT IN SPIRITS I SUPPOSE SAID RUSHBROOK
FOR WERE I TO LET LORD ELMWOOD KNOW WHAT HAS NOW PASSED IT IS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE NOT FOR MINE IF YOU DO NOT YOU SHALL NOT DARE ME TO IT MR RUSHBROOK AND HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT
IN HIS PRESENCE UNSUPPORTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ANY OTHER EVERY GRACE THAT SHE HAD PRACTISED EVERY LOOK THAT SHE HAD BORROWED TO SET OFF HER CHARMS WERE ANNIHILATED
THE WEDDING DAY PRICE ONE SHILLING EACH
DO YOU THINK CONTINUED SANDFORD THE INTELLIGENCE WILL GIVE HER ANY SATISFACTION PERHAPS NOT WILL IT BE OF ANY TO YOURSELF THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD AND SO ALL YOU HAVE BEEN URGING UPON THIS OCCASION IS AT LAST ONLY TO PLEASE YOURSELF YOU WRONG MY MEANING--IT IS HER MERIT WHICH INSPIRES ME WITH THE DESIRE OF BEING KNOWN TO HER--IT IS HER SUFFERINGS HER INNOCENCE HER BEAUTY SANDFORD STARED--RUSHBROOK PROCEEDED
THE THREE OR FOUR DAYS FOR THEIR TEMPORARY ABODE BEING PASSED THEY BOTH RETURNED TOGETHER TO ELMWOOD HOUSE
IN THE COLD NIPPING FROST OF DISAPPOINTMENT SICKNESS OR CONNUBIAL STRIFE THEY WILL FORSAKE THE HOUSE OF CARE ALTHOUGH THE VERY HOUSE WHICH THEY MAY HAVE THEMSELVES BUILT HERE THE EXCRUCIATING ANGUISH OF THE FATHER OVERCAME THAT OF THE DYING MAN
IN A FEW DAYS THEY DEPARTED
BUT WHY GIVE HER THAT TITLE ALREADY MR SANDFORD BECAUSE ANSWERED HE I THINK SHE WILL NEVER HAVE IT BLESS ME MR SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY YOU SHOCK ME I THOUGHT I SHOULD REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE I TOLD IT YOU FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOTHING NEW--HER INDISCRETIONS ONLY I KNOW SHE IS IMPRUDENT SAID MISS WOODLEY--"I CAN SEE THAT HER CONDUCT IS OFTEN EXCEPTIONABLE--BUT THEN LORD ELMWOOD SURELY LOVES HER AND LOVE WILL OVERLOOK A GREAT DEAL HE DOES LOVE HER--BUT HE HAS UNDERSTANDING AND RESOLUTION
EQUIVOCATING AGAIN SIR
DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE INTERVENING PERIOD SHE LIVED IN LODGINGS IN LEICESTER SQUARE--OR LEICESTER FIELDS AS THE PLACE WAS STILL OFTEN CALLED--IN A HOUSE OPPOSITE THAT OF SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS
OH DO NOT LET ME HAZARD BEING ONCE AGAIN TURNED OUT OF HIS HOUSE
SHE IMMEDIATELY SNATCHED IT FROM HIM AND WITHDREW INTO HER CHAMBER
THIS ALARMED POOR MISS WOODLEY
AND FROM THE TEMPORAL POINT OF VIEW MRS INCHBALD'S PLAYS MUST BE REGARDED MERELY AS MEANS--MEANS TOWARDS HER OWN ENFRANCHISEMENT AND THAT CONDITION OF THINGS WHICH MADE POSSIBLE A SIMPLE STORY THAT NOVEL HAD BEEN SKETCHED AS EARLY AS 1777
BUT AS THE ATTENDANTS WERE PRESENT NOTHING PASSED ON EITHER SIDE RESPECTING THE INCIDENT IN THE MORNING
SORROWFUL AND AFFECTING AS THIS INTERVIEW HAD BEEN RUSHBROOK AS HE RODE HOME REFLECTED UPON IT WITH THE MOST INORDINATE DELIGHT
IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE ENGLISH HEROINE IS THE PRECISE CONTRARY OF THE FRENCH ONE
BUT MISS MILNER ENTERED AND PUT AN END TO THE DISCOURSE
BLESS ME MR SANDFORD CRIED MISS MILNER I MEANT NO REFLECTION UPON MISS FENTON'S DISPOSITION
THIS IS A PROPER JUSTIFICATION OF SIR EDWARD--AND WHEN I FALL IN LOVE I BEG THAT YOU WILL MAKE THE SAME EXCUSE FOR ME THEN SAID HE EARNESTLY BEFORE YOUR HEART IS IN THAT STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED EXERT YOUR REASON I SHALL ANSWERED SHE AND NOT CONSENT TO MARRY A MAN WHOM I COULD NEVER LOVE UNLESS YOUR HEART IS ALREADY GIVEN AWAY MISS MILNER WHAT CAN MAKE YOU SPEAK WITH SUCH A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY HE THOUGHT ON LORD FREDERICK WHEN HE SAID THIS AND HE RIVETED HIS EYES UPON HER AS IF TO PENETRATE HER SENTIMENTS AND YET TREMBLED FOR WHAT HE SHOULD FIND THERE
SANDFORD AND HE BOTH REPLIED AT THE SAME TIME YES AND SANDFORD BUT NOT LORD ELMWOOD LOOKED AT MISS MILNER WHEN HE SPOKE
AND THEREFORE WOULD CERTAINLY GIVE TO ALL HE SAID THE OPPOSITE COLOURING
IT MAKES THE POOR MAN HAPPY AS THE RICH THE FOOL BLEST AS THE WISE THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD LOVED WAS EXPRESSED MORE THAN IN WORDS AS HE SAID THIS
GO LEAVE THE ROOM SIR HE INSTANTLY OBEYED
FOR HE MEANS TO GO THERE HIMSELF TO KEEP HER GUARDIAN WITH HER MISS MILNER SEEMED INCLINED TO CONVERSE
WITHOUT THE FRIENDSHIP OF MR DORRIFORTH LIFE WOULD BE A HEAVY BURTHEN INDEED MISS WOODLEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO CONTRIVE SCHEMES FOR THEIR SEPARATION
I DO BELIEVE SAID MISS WOODLEY THAT YOUNG MAN HAS SOME GOOD QUALITIES A GREAT MANY RETURNED SANDFORD MUTTERINGLY
HE HAD BUT FOR SANDFORD FOLLOWED HIS UNCLE AND EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HIS ANGER SOONER THAN HAVE ENDURED THE MOST PIERCING INQUIETUDE WHICH HE WAS DOOMED TO SUFFER TILL THE NEWS ARRIVED OF LADY MATILDA'S SAFETY
WHEN SHE AWOKE INSTEAD OF THE USUAL MELANCHOLY SCENE BEFORE HER VIEW SHE BEHELD HER FATHER AND HEARD THE VOICE OF THE ONCE DREADED LORD ELMWOOD TENDERLY SAYING WE WILL GO NO FURTHER TO-NIGHT THE FATIGUE IS TOO MUCH FOR HER
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DO NOT DISOBEY HIM A SECOND TIME NO DEAR MADAM DON'T CRIED HER WOMAN FOR HE IS LIKE A LION--HE HAS BEEN SCOLDING ME GOOD GOD EXCLAIMED MISS MILNER AND IN A TONE THAT SEEMED PROPHETIC THEN HE IS NOT TO BE MY HUSBAND AFTER ALL YES CRIED MISS WOODLEY IF YOU WILL ONLY BE HUMBLE AND APPEAR SORRY
HE MEANS LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY SAID MISS MILNER CARELESSLY BUT A BLUSH OF SHAME SPREAD OVER HER FACE
BUT HE TRUSTED THE EXTREME WEIGHT WHICH OPPRESSED HIS MIND LEST HE SHOULD MISTAKE THE REAL SENTIMENTS OF A PERSON WHOSE HAPPINESS DEPENDED UPON HIS CORRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THEM WOULD PLEAD HIS EXCUSE
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD APPEAR THUS EASY ADDED HE WITH A SMILE IF I WERE GOING TO BE SHOT AT BY MY LORD FREDERICK VERY WELL CRIED SANDFORD WITH A LOOK THAT EVINCED HE WAS BETTER INFORMED
AS TO THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION SHE WAS NOT ONLY INSENSIBLE BUT WHOLLY INATTENTIVE TO ALL THAT WAS SAID TO HER ON THE SUBJECT
I WILL EVEN SAID HE NOW THAT SHE IS IN MY POWER WIN HER AFFECTIONS--AND WHEN IN FONDNESS HEREAFTER SHE HANGS UPON ME HOW WILL SHE THANK ME FOR THIS LITTLE TRIAL THROUGH WHICH I SHALL HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HAPPINESS THUS DID HE HUSH HIS REMORSE WHILE HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY AT HOME IN EXPECTATION OF HIS PRIZE
HER HEART WAS TOO SUSCEPTIBLE TO BEAR THIS DISRESPECTFUL AND CONTUMELIOUS FROWN FROM THE OBJECT OF HER LONG-DEVOTED CARE AND CONCERN
A TOKEN OF APPROBATION FROM YOU MR DORRIFORTH RETURNED SHE I ALWAYS CONSIDERED WITH HIGH ESTIMATION--BUT YOUR COMMENDATIONS ARE NOW BECOME INFINITELY SUPERIOR IN VALUE BY THEIR SCARCITY
SHE THEREFORE SAT A SILENT SPECTATOR WAITING WITH DREAD FOR THE TIME WHEN SHE WHO NOW SCORNED HER ADVICE WOULD FLY TO HER IN VAIN FOR COMFORT
AND I GIVE YOU MY HONOUR THAT UPON NO PRETENCE WHATEVER WILL I PRESUME TO INTRUDE HERE AGAIN
TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME I DO MY LORD SHE ANSWERED TREMBLING
PERCEIVING A GENTLEMAN SHE STOPPED SHORT AT THE DOOR
BUT IF YOU WILL NOT I MUST ENDEAVOUR MISS WOODLEY WAS LEAVING THE ROOM TO PERFORM THIS GOOD WORK WHEN MRS HORTON IN IMITATION OF THE EXAMPLE GIVEN HER BY DORRIFORTH CRIED NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN--AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
MR DORRIFORTH WITH ALL THOSE PRUDENT ADMONITIONS APPEARS RATHER LIKE A MAN WHO HAS PASSED HIS LIFE IN THE GAY WORLD EXPERIENCED ALL ITS DANGEROUS ALLUREMENTS ALL ITS REPENTANT SORROWS
WHEN LADY ELMWOOD'S OLD AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAW HER YOUTHFUL CHARGE LYING PALE AND SPEECHLESS YET NO FATHER BY TO COMFORT OR SOOTH HER SHE LIFTED UP HER HANDS TO HEAVEN EXCLAIMING WITH A BURST OF TEARS AND IS THIS THE END OF THEE MY POOR CHILD
I OUGHT AND I MEANT TO HAVE GONE ABROAD
TO MISS MILNER NEVER
AND YET AS IF ENRAPTURED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE THIS CONDUCT GAVE TO HIS PROSPECTS
WHEN THE TIME SHE WAS TO SET OUT FOR BATH WAS ONLY TWO DAYS OFF THE BEHAVIOUR OF DORRIFORTH TOOK BY DEGREES ITS USUAL FORM IF NOT A GREATER SHARE OF POLITE AND TENDER ATTENTION THAN EVER
NAY REPLIED HE PERHAPS YOU OUGHT TO STAY HERE TILL YOU ARE BETTER I AM BETTER SAID SHE AND READY TO GO WITH YOU."----HALF AFRAID THAT HE MEANT TO SEND HER FROM HIM
YET BE THE CAUSE WHAT IT WILL SINCE THESE FAULTS HAVE EXISTED I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISAVOW OR EXTENUATE THEM AND I BEG YOUR PARDON
IN THIS HER DISCARDED STATE HE NO LONGER BURTHENED HIS LIVELY IMAGINATION WITH THE DULL THOUGHTS OF MARRIAGE BUT ONCE MORE FORMED THE IDEA OF MAKING HER HIS MISTRESS
DRESSING WITH EXTRAORDINARY PLAINNESS AND OFTEN GOING WITHOUT A FIRE IN WINTER
ON THIS OCCASION THE AUDIENCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM KEMBLE TO MRS INCHBALD EXTINGUISHED ALL THE LIGHTS ROUND THE HOUSE
HE SAW IT AND TO SOFTEN HER STILL MORE WITH THE SENSE OF HIS ESTEEM FOR HER HE INCREASED HIS EARNESTNESS WHILE HE SAID IF YOU WILL TAKE THE RESOLUTION TO QUIT LONDON FOR THE TIME I MENTION THERE SHALL BE NO MEANS OMITTED TO MAKE THE COUNTRY ALL YOU CAN WISH--I SHALL INSIST UPON MISS WOODLEY'S COMPANY FOR BOTH OUR SAKES
BESIDES WILL NOT MY TITLE BE EXTINCT WHOEVER I MAKE MY HEIR
OH TALL ENOUGH OF ALL CONSCIENCE RETURNED SHE
RUSHBROOK WAS PETRIFIED
MRS INCHBALD NO DOUBT OWED MUCH TO RICHARDSON
LORD ELMWOOD IRRITATED BY THIS POSTURE AS A SIGN OF THE PRESUMPTUOUS HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FORGIVEN SUFFERED NOW HIS ANGER TO BURST ALL BOUNDS
FOR AS TO ALL THOSE LITTLE DISPUTES BETWEEN MR SANDFORD AND YOU SAID HE I SHOULD BE PARTIAL IF I BLAMED YOU MORE THAN HIM--INDEED WHEN YOU TAKE THE LIBERTY TO CONDEMN HIM HIS CHARACTER MAKES THE FREEDOM APPEAR IN A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT THAN WHEN HE COMPLAINS OF YOU--AND YET IF HE PROVOKES YOUR RETORTS HE ALONE MUST ANSWER FOR THEM
CAN I GO TO THE LADIES
TO VIOLENT ANGER SUCCEEDED A DEGREE OF INDIFFERENCE STILL MORE FATAL--LADY ELMWOOD'S HEART WAS NOT FORMED FOR SUCH A STATE--THERE WHERE ALL THE TUMULTUOUS PASSIONS HARBOURED BY TURNS ONE AMONG THEM SOON FOUND THE MEANS TO OCCUPY ALL VACANCIES
SANDFORD HAD INDEED PROMISED HIS PROTECTION TO THE DAUGHTER
SHE HELD HIM IN HER ARMS WHILE SHE SAT AT TABLE AND REPEATEDLY SAID TO HIM THOUGH HE HAD NOT THE SENSE TO THANK HER THAT SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE HIS FRIEND THE FIRST EMOTIONS OF RESENTMENT AGAINST DORRIFORTH BEING PASSED SHE RETURNED WITH HER LITTLE CHARGE TO THE FARM HOUSE BEFORE IT WAS LIKELY HIS UNCLE SHOULD COME BACK
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT COMEDIES IN FIVE ACTS
MILDNESS TENDERNESS AND PITY BEAMED TO SUPPORT AND CONSOLE THE PENITENT
AND NOT TILL HALF AFTER FOUR WERE THEY PREVAILED ON TO RETURN
NAY SAID SANDFORD LORD ELMWOOD HAS NOT YET PASSED HIS WORD THAT HE WILL NEVER SEE HER MORE--HE HAS ONLY THREATENED TO DO IT
AS A JESUIT HE WAS CONSEQUENTLY A MAN OF LEARNING
LORD ELMWOOD PROCEEDED
CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER VI
BUT CONFUSION AT THE SUDDEN SURPRISE WAS ON THE FACE OF BOTH PARTIES--HE SAW IT AND LOOKED AT EACH OF THEM BY TURNS WITH A STERNNESS THAT MADE POOR MISS WOODLEY READY TO FAINT
YES SIR A PETTICOAT REPLIED THE WOMAN
ADIEU I'LL GO THIS MOMENT SAID SHE AND ROSE HASTILY
FOR HE MEANT TO BE THE FIRST TO LAY BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD HIS PRETENSIONS AS A SUITOR
AND LORD ELMWOOD ACCOMPANIED BY RUSHBROOK WENT TO A SMALL SHOOTING SEAT NEAR TWENTY MILES DISTANT FROM ELMWOOD CASTLE FOR A WEEK'S PARTICULAR SPORT
AND YET I CANNOT COMMEND THIS SAID SHE
BY MAKING A PRESENT TO THE NURSE SHE READILY GAINED HER CONSENT TO PART WITH HIM FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THE SIGNS OF JOY DENOTED BY THE CHILD ON BEING PUT INTO THE CARRIAGE REPAID HER BEFOREHAND FOR EVERY REPROOF SHE MIGHT RECEIVE FROM HER GUARDIAN FOR THE LIBERTY SHE HAD TAKEN
HERE NO DOUBT THERE IS A TOUCH OF MELODRAMA
DO YOU KNOW MADAM THAT MY LORD IS GOING TO BE MARRIED TO MISS FENTON YES ANSWERED MISS MILNER
WHEN WORD WAS BROUGHT THAT THE CARRIAGE WAS AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS TO CONVEY HER FROM ALL SHE HELD SO DEAR AND SHE SAW BEFORE HER THE PROSPECT OF A LONG YOUTHFUL AND HEALTHFUL LIFE IN WHICH MISERY AND DESPAIR WERE ALL SHE COULD DISCERN
I CANNOT WRITE DISTINCTLY WHAT I WOULD--MY SENSES ARE NOT IMPAIRED BUT THE POWERS OF EXPRESSION ARE
YET SAID AFTER ALL I DARE NOT SEE HIM AGAIN YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE SAID MISS WOODLEY BUT I WILL
AND MISS MILNER LOVED DORRIFORTH WITHOUT ONE CONSCIOUS CHECK TO TELL HER SHE WAS WRONG EXCEPT THAT WHICH CONVINCED HER--HER LOVE WOULD BE AVOIDED BY HIM WITH DETESTATION AND WITH HORROR
BUT THE NATURAL VIVACITY THE GAIETY WHICH REPORT HAD GIVEN TO MISS MILNER WERE SOFTENED BY HER RECENT SORROW TO A MEEK SADNESS--AND THAT HAUGHTY DISPLAY OF CHARMS IMPUTED TO HER MANNERS WAS CHANGED TO A PENSIVE DEMEANOR
BUT NO SOONER WAS HIS FEVER ABATED AND HIS SENSES PERFECTLY RECOVERED FROM THE SLIGHT DERANGEMENT HIS MALADY HAD OCCASIONED THAN THE LIVELY REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT HE HAD HINTED ALARMED HIM AND HE WAS EVEN AFRAID TO LOOK HIS KIND BUT AWFUL RELATION IN THE FACE
FOR THOUGH TO NAME HER GAVE HIM EXTREME PLEASURE YET IT WAS A PLEASURE ACCOMPANIED BY CONFUSION AND PAIN
BUT MISS FENTON HAD OF LATE SHUNNED THEIR SOCIETY AND EVEN IN THEIR COMPANY WAS OF A TEMPER TOO RESERVED EVER TO DISCOVER HER MIND
AND THOUGH HE RECEIVED HER POLITELY WHEN SHE DID PAY HIM A VISIT IT WAS ALWAYS VERY COLDLY
BUT HER PLEASURE WAS IN GREAT MEASURE ECLIPSED BY THE REFLECTION THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PERSON AS MISS FENTON--SHE WISHED SHE HAD BEEN EQUALLY ACQUAINTED WITH HER'S AS WITH MISS MILNER'S HEART AND SHE WOULD THEN HAVE ACTED WITHOUT INJUSTICE TO EITHER
MY LORD IF YOU MEAN TO GO TO THE HOTEL I'LL GO WITH YOU IF YOU PLEASE CRIED SANDFORD OFFICIOUSLY
THE TIME WAS URGENT
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE ELEVATED HIS VOICE AM I THE MASTER HERE YOUR SERVANTS REPLIED SHE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY WILL NOT TELL YOU SO
AND HE NOW WALKED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN THE ROOM LOST IN THOUGHT AND CARE
WITHIN A FEW HOURS LORD ELMWOOD SET OFF ACCOMPANIED BY HIS GUIDE THE FARMER AND OTHER ATTENDANTS FURNISHED WITH EVERY REQUISITE TO ASCERTAIN THE SUCCESS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE--WHILE POOR MATILDA LITTLE THOUGHT OF A DELIVERER NIGH MUCH LESS THAT HER DELIVERER SHOULD PROVE HER FATHER
THE VANITY OF THE WORLD THE FOLLY OF RICHES THE CHARMS OF RETIREMENT AND SUCH TOPICS ENGAGED THEIR DISCOURSE BUT NOT THEIR THOUGHTS FOR NEAR TWO HOURS
HAVE MADE NO PREVIOUS PROMISES NONE ON EARTH MY LORD REPLIED RUSHBROOK CANDIDLY
NOW CONVINCED THERE WAS NONE AS STRENUOUSLY COMMENDED OPEN VIOLENCE;--AND SHELTERED UNDER THE CONSIDERATION THAT THEIR DEPREDATIONS WERE TO BE PRACTISED UPON A DEFENCELESS WOMAN WHO HAD NOT ONE PROTECTOR EXCEPT AN OLD PRIEST THE SUBJECT OF THEIR RIDICULE;--ASSURED LIKEWISE FROM THE INFLUENCE OF LORD MARGRAVE'S WEALTH THAT ALL INFERIOR CONSEQUENCES COULD BE OVERBORNE THEY SAW NO ROOM FOR FEARS ON ANY SIDE AND WHAT THEY WISHED TO EXECUTE WITH CARE AND SKILL PREMEDITATED
AND I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT I WAS MISTAKEN YOU THEN OWN YOU AT FIRST TOLD ME A FALSEHOOD AND YET HAVE ALL THIS TIME KEPT ME IN SUSPENSE WITHOUT CONFESSING IT I WAITED MY LORD TILL YOU SHOULD ENQUIRE YOU HAVE THEN SIR WAITED TOO LONG AND THE FIRE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
AND NOW LORD ELMWOOD'S INQUIETUDE WHICH HE HAD BUT SLIGHTLY NOTICED BEFORE CAME FULL TO HIS OBSERVATION
HE WAS ALWAYS AN OBJECT WHICH ADDED TO MY UNHAPPINESS
THE PRESENT REPRINT IS TAKEN FROM THE FOURTH PUBLISHED IN 1799--BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF THE CHARACTERISTIC PREFACE WHICH AFTER THE SECOND EDITION WAS DROPPED
BUT LADY MATILDA MADE A FULL STOP AND SAID IN THE GENTLEST ACCENTS I HOPE MR RUSHBROOK YOU ARE PERFECTLY RECOVERED IT WAS THE SWEETEST MUSIC HE HAD EVER LISTENED TO
WHO CRIED SHE SHALL PREVENT ME FLYING TO MY FATHER
AND IT SOMETIMES ELATED AT OTHER TIMES DEPRESSED HER
YET AGAIN DO NOT SUFFER ME TO INTERFERE IF THE BREAKING WITH LORD FREDERICK CAN MILITATE AGAINST YOUR FELICITY BY NO MEANS SHE ANSWERED
HE CAUGHT HER AS BY THE SAME IMPULSE HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ANY OTHER PERSON FALLING FOR WANT OF AID
REFLECT UPON HIM TOO IN YOUR MOMENTS OF DISSIPATION AND LET HIS IDEA CONTROUL YOUR INDISCRETIONS--NOT MERELY IN AN HOUR OF CONTRADICTION CALL PEEVISHLY UPON HIS NAME ONLY TO WOUND THE DEAREST FRIEND YOU HAVE THERE WAS A DEGREE OF TRUTH AND A DEGREE OF PASSIONATE FEELING IN THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SPEECH THAT ALARMED SANDFORD--HE CAUGHT UP ONE OF THE CANDLES AND LAYING HOLD OF HIS FRIEND'S ELBOW DREW HIM OUT OF THE ROOM CRYING COME MY LORD COME TO YOUR BED-CHAMBER--IT IS VERY LATE--IT IS MORNING--IT IS TIME TO RISE AND BY A CONTINUAL REPETITION OF THESE WORDS IN A VERY LOUD VOICE DROWNED WHATEVER LORD ELMWOOD OR ANY OTHER PERSON MIGHT HAVE WISHED EITHER TO HAVE SAID OR TO HAVE HEARD
MISS WOODLEY WAS LEANING ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR TO OBSERVE THE GAME AND MR SANDFORD SAT READING ONE OF THE FATHERS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE PLACE
HE FELT HIS MIND BY THE LATE INCIDENT TOO MUCH SOFTENED FOR SUCH HARSHNESS
SHE HAD BEEN TOO FREQUENTLY TOLD THE HIGH VALUE OF THAT BEAUTY AND THOUGHT EVERY MOMENT PASSED IN WASTEFUL IDLENESS DURING WHICH SHE WAS NOT GAINING SOME NEW CONQUEST
AND SANDFORD WHO SELDOM QUITTED HIS APARTMENT WENT FREQUENTLY TO HIS BEDSIDE EVERY TIME WITH THE SECRET HOPE HE SHOULD HEAR HIM ASK TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER--HE WAS EVERY TIME DISAPPOINTED--YET HE SAW HIM SHAKE WITH A CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP THE HAND OF RUSHBROOK AS IF HE DELIGHTED IN SEEING THOSE HE LOVED
THE ENTRANCE OF MR SANDFORD WHO KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS HOWEVER ANOTHER RELIEF
HOW CAME YOU TO DO SO MAD A THING CRIED SANDFORD
SHE REPLIED TO MISS WOODLEY'S LETTER AND DWELT VERY LONG ON THAT SUBJECT WHICH HER FRIEND HAD PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
THOU WHO ART THE INSTIGATOR OF SO MANY BAD AUTHORS AND ACTORS--THOU WHO FROM MY INFANCY SELDOM HAST FORSAKEN ME STILL ABIDE WITH ME
HE RECOVERED BUT LADY ELMWOOD FELL SICK AND LANGUISHED--POSSESSED OF YOUTH TO STRUGGLE WITH HER WOES SHE LINGERED ON TILL TEN YEARS DECLINE BROUGHT HER TO THAT PERIOD WITH WHICH THE READER IS NOW GOING TO BE PRESENTED
I THANK YOU--YOU ARE KIND--YOU ARE CONSIDERATE BE NOT HASTY IN YOUR GRATITUDE
AND ADD THAT I HAVE GIVEN MY WORD IF HE WILL ALLOW ME A SHORT TIME A YEAR OR TWO ONLY I WILL DURING THAT PERIOD TRY TO DISENGAGE THEM AND USE ALL MY POWER TO RENDER MYSELF WORTHY OF THE UNION FOR WHICH HE DESIGNS ME AND THIS IS NOT ONLY YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE--BUT YOUR FIXED DETERMINATION NAY WHY WILL YOU SEARCH MY HEART TO THE BOTTOM WHEN THE SURFACE OUGHT TO CONTENT YOU IF YOU CANNOT RESOLVE ON WHAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED WHY DO YOU ASK THIS TIME OF YOUR UNCLE
FOR TO SPEAK UPON ANY SUBJECT THAT DID NOT ENGAGE THEIR THOUGHTS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT AND TO SPEAK UPON THE ONLY ONE THAT DID HAD BEEN AFFLICTING
SANDFORD HAD CERTAINLY FEWER FEARS THAN EITHER
BUT IT WAS A GRATIFICATION WHICH HER FEARS HER TREMOR HER EXTREME SENSIBILITY WOULD NOT PERMIT HER TO ENJOY
THEY ARE THE SENSATIONS WHICH IMPEL ME TO SPEAK THUS UNDISGUISED EVEN TO YOU MY OPEN--NO EVEN WORSE--MY SECRET ENEMY INSULT ME AS YOU PLEASE MR RUSHBROOK,--BUT BEWARE HOW YOU MENTION LORD ELMWOOD'S DAUGHTER CAN IT BE TO HER DISHONOUR THAT I PITY HER
PRESENTLY AFTER SANDFORD
CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN INFERIORITY IN THESE SUBJECTS OF HER GUARDIAN'S PRAISE MISS MILNER INSTEAD OF BEING INSPIRED TO EMULATION WAS PROVOKED TO ENVY
BY NO MEANS MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY RETURNED SHE--"I HAVE INDEED DONE WITH MY LORD FREDERICK FROM THIS DAY
IT IS BUT TOO REFINED WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY
SHE SAID HER ORDERS WERE TO BE OBEDIENT WHILE SHE HERSELF WAS OBEYED--AT LEAST IN CIRCUMSTANCES SO MATERIAL AS THE LADY'S HEALTH OF WHICH SHE HAD THE CHARGE AS A PHYSICIAN AND EXPECTED EQUAL COMPLIANCE FROM HER PATIENT--FOOD AND FRESH APPAREL SHE PRESCRIBED AS THE ONLY MEANS TO PREVENT DEATH
THE COMPANIONS AND COUNSELLORS OF LORD MARGRAVE WHO HAD SO PRUDENTLY ADVISED GENTLE METHODS IN THE PURSUIT OF HIS PASSION WHILE THERE WAS LEFT ANY HOPE OF THEIR SUCCESS
BUT AS A VARIETY OF CONCERNS REQUIRE MY PRESENCE IN ENGLAND EVERY NECESSARY CEREMONY HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE THEN YOUR LORDSHIP IS NO LONGER IN ORDERS SAID MISS WOODLEY
HE WAS THE PROFESSED LOVER OF MISS MILNER--SHE THE HAPPIEST OF HUMAN BEINGS--MISS WOODLEY PARTAKING IN THE JOY--MR SANDFORD LAMENTING WITH THE DEEPEST CONCERN THAT MISS FENTON HAD BEEN SUPPLANTED
MY LORD WHO WRITES THIS LETTER I WELL KNOW--I WELL KNOW ALSO TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED--I FEEL WITH THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE BOTH OUR SITUATIONS
THE WORDS MURDER AND EXCOMMUNICATION HE HAD LIKEWISE UTTERED
WHICH IT SELDOM FAILS TO DO NEVERTHELESS THE CORRESPONDENCE CONTINUED AND EARLY IN 1772 SOME ENTRIES IN HER DIARY GIVE A GLIMPSE OF HER STATE OF MIND JAN
AND MISS MILNER CONTINUED HE I NOT ONLY ENTREAT BUT COMMAND YOU TO TELL ME--HAVE YOU GIVEN YOUR WORD OR YOUR AFFECTIONS TO LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY THE COLOUR SPREAD OVER HER FACE AND SHE REPLIED--"I THOUGHT CONFESSIONS WERE ALWAYS TO BE IN SECRET
POSSESSED OF STEADINESS TO ACCOMPLISH THE END OF ANY DESIGN ONCE MEDITATED AND OF SAGACITY TO DIRECT THE CONDUCT OF MEN MORE POWERFUL BUT LESS INGENIOUS THAN HIMSELF
DO NOT DEPART MADAM SAID HE WITHOUT HEARING MY APOLOGY FOR BEING HERE THOUGH MATILDA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE HER INFANCY THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO TELL HER WHO IT WAS THAT ADDRESSED HER--HIS ELEGANT AND YOUTHFUL PERSON JOINED TO THE INCIDENT WHICH HAD JUST OCCURRED CONVINCED HER IT WAS RUSHBROOK
ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD SAID DO YOU KNOW SANDFORD I MET MISS WOODLEY THIS MORNING AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR GIFFARD I SHOULD HAVE PASSED HER WITHOUT KNOWING HER--BUT MISS WOODLEY IF I AM NOT SO MUCH ALTERED BUT THAT YOU KNEW ME I TAKE IT UNKIND YOU DID NOT SPEAK FIRST SHE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK EVEN NOW--HE SAW IT AND CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
HE HAD EVEN INQUIRED STERNLY OF GIFFARD ON HIS RETURNING HOME IF MISS WOODLEY HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THE STEWARD GUESSING THE WHOLE OF HIS MEANING ANSWERED YES MY LORD
IS IT LADY ELMWOOD'S WRITING ASKED LORD ELMWOOD EXTREMELY DISCOMPOSED
THEY DINED AND SAID NOTHING EITHER TO PROVOKE OR SOOTH HER
AMONG THE MANY VISITORS WHO ATTENDED AT HER LEVEES AND FOLLOWED HER WHEREVER SHE WENT THERE WAS ONE WHO SEEMED EVEN WHEN ABSENT FROM HER TO SHARE HER THOUGHTS
LET HER DAUGHTER GO THERE
HERE HE HAD TO PASS SANDFORD
SOMETIMES SHE TRIED TO CONSIDER THIS DISREGARD OF HER AS MERELY THE EFFECT OF ILL-BREEDING
BUT WHILE HE WAS THUS OFF HIS GUARD SANDFORD NEVER WAS--AND HAD MISS MILNER BEEN THE DEAREST THING ON EARTH TO HIM HE COULD NOT HAVE WATCHED HER MORE NARROWLY
AND IT WAS AGREED THEY SHOULD
FOR IF HIS UNCLE WAS AT PRESENT UNRESOLVED WHETHER TO FORGIVE OR TO RESENT THIS DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS ANOTHER'S INTERFERENCE MIGHT ENRAGE AND PRECIPITATE HIM ON THE LATTER
WHERE SHE PARTOOK OF NO ONE COMFORT FROM SOCIETY OR FROM LIFE BUT THE STILL UNREMITTING FRIENDSHIP OF MISS WOODLEY
THE NEXT MORNING EARLY MR SANDFORD RETURNED TO ELMWOOD HOUSE BUT WITH HIS SPIRITS DEPRESSED AND HIS HEART OVERCHARGED WITH SORROW
HASTILY RECALLED HIS FORMER COUNTENANCE AND STOPPED THE CONVERSATION
SUCH AS IT IS HOWEVER I GRANT IT
BUT LET THIS BE A WARNING TO YOU HE WAS PROCEEDING WITH THE MOST AUSTERE LOOKS AND POINTED LANGUAGE WHEN OBSERVING THE SHAME AND THE SELF-REPROACH THAT AGITATED HER MIND HE DIVESTED HIMSELF IN GREAT MEASURE OF HIS RESENTMENT AND SAID MILDLY LET THIS BE A WARNING TO YOU HOW YOU DEAL IN FUTURE WITH THE FRIENDS WHO WISH YOU WELL
HIS HABITATION WAS IN THE HOUSE OF A MRS HORTON AN ELDERLY GENTLEWOMAN WHO HAD A MAIDEN NIECE RESIDING WITH HER NOT MANY YEARS YOUNGER THAN HERSELF
YOU ARE MORE TORMENTING TO ME THAN ANY ONE I HAVE ABOUT ME
AND I SWEAR EVER SHALL BE SO WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION NAME THE OBJECT SAID LORD ELMWOOD ANXIOUSLY
BUT MISS MILNER WHO DREADED THE WORD INTERRUPTED THE PERIOD AND EXCLAIMED OH
AND J
AND J
AND J
AND J
AND J
YET SUCH WAS HIS ATTENTION TO THOSE IN POVERTY AND THE MODERATION OF HIS OWN DESIRES THAT HE LIVED IN ALL THE CAREFUL PLAINNESS OF OECONOMY
SHE STARTED AND CRIED COULD LORD ELMWOOD KNOW FOR WHAT HE SENT ME HE DID REPLIED RUSHBROOK--"I BOLDLY TOLD HIM OF MY PRESUMPTUOUS LOVE AND HE HAS GIVEN TO YOU ALONE THE POWER OVER MY HAPPINESS OR MISERY
AFTER SEVERAL EFFORTS TO CONQUER THESE NICE AND REFINED SENSATIONS BUT TO NO PURPOSE SHE AT LAST WENT TO HIS APARTMENT
BUT I AM VEXT TO SEE THAT YOU ARE SORRY YOU HAVE SAID IT ANGRY AT YOUR BEING A HERETIC HE RESUMED--"INDEED I SHOULD BE MUCH MORE CONCERNED TO SEE YOU A DISGRACE TO OUR RELIGION MISS MILNER HAD NOT BEEN IN A GOOD HUMOUR THE WHOLE EVENING--SHE HAD BEEN PROVOKED SEVERAL TIMES TO THE FULL EXTENT OF HER PATIENCE
HER NEXT CARE WAS THAT HER DRESS SHOULD EXACTLY FIT AND DISPLAY HER FINE PERSON TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE--IT DID SO
IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS SHE IS SURE THAT YOU WILL MY LORD THEN MUST THE PERSON BE UNWORTHY OF HER MISS WOODLEY ROSE FROM HER SEAT--SHE CLASPED HER HANDS--EVERY LOOK AND EVERY GESTURE PROVED HER ALTERNATE RESOLUTION AND IRRESOLUTION OF PROCEEDING
FOR THE DISCARDED DAUGHTER OF LORD ELMWOOD CANNOT EXPECT THE SAME PROPOSALS WHICH I MADE WHILE SHE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HER FATHER WHAT PROPOSALS THEN MY LORD ASKED SANDFORD HASTILY
HE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS AND HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A MOST SERIOUS FACE;--SHE IMMEDIATELY CALLED TO MIND THE ASSURANCE HE HAD GIVEN HER THAT HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LORD FREDERICK IN ITS THEN IMPROPER STATE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE AND BETWEEN CHAGRIN AND CONFUSION SHE WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO BEHAVE
THE BLISS ARISING FROM IT I DOUBT NOT IS SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER--BUT BEST NOT TO BE VENTURED FOR IN MY OPINION TILL SOME LITTLE TIME HAVE PROVED THE EMPTINESS OF ALL OTHER
AND AT THIS REPLY HE DID NOT THROW HIM FROM HIM--BUT HE REMOVED HIS HANDS WHICH HAD SUPPORTED HIM SO SUDDENLY THAT THE CHILD TO PREVENT FALLING ON THE FLOOR THREW HIMSELF ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S NECK
WHEN THIS WAS TOLD MATILDA SHE STARTED AND LOOKED JUST AS HER MOTHER AT HER AGE HAD OFTEN DONE WHEN IN SPITE OF HER LOVE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD OFFENDED HIM AND WAS TERRIFIED AT HIS APPROACH
OR IF IT HAD NOT A WORD COULD SHE HAVE GIVEN
SHE SENT A VERBAL ANSWER SHE WAS ENGAGED HE SENT AGAIN BEGGING SHE WOULD NAME HER OWN TIME
BELIEVE ME MISS MILNER THAT IN THE MIDST OF YOUR GAYEST FOLLIES WHILE YOU THUS CONTINUE TO BLUSH I SHALL REVERENCE YOUR INTERNAL SENSATIONS OH
YOU NEED NOT TELL ME THAT MR SANDFORD
I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME I MISTOOK--FOR I HAD BEFORE GIVEN MY WORD THAT I SHOULD PASS IT ABROAD INDEED CRIED HE
THE PURE THOUGHTS THAT DWELL IN HER INNOCENT MIND ARE NOT LESS SENSUAL THAN MINE TOWARDS HER
THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM COULD SO WELL DEFINE THE CAUSE OF THIS OPPRESSION AS MATILDA COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE WEIGHT WHICH OPPRESSED HER'S
ANOTHER INSTANCE OF OBEDIENCE WHICH MISS WOODLEY WAS IMPATIENT HER GUARDIAN SHOULD KNOW
YOU ARE TO BLAME SAID HE TO HIM AND MISS WOODLEY TO WISH BY YOUR ARRIVAL TO DIVIDE WITH LORD ELMWOOD THAT TENDER BOND WHICH TIES THE GOOD WHO CONFER OBLIGATIONS TO THE OBJECT OF THEIR BENEVOLENCE
ONE GREAT INCIDENT HOWEVER TOTALLY REVERSED THE HOPE OF ALL FUTURE ACCOMMODATION
THIS LAST INTELLIGENCE MADE MISS WOODLEY SHUDDER--SHE REPEATED IT HOWEVER TO MISS MILNER WORD FOR WORD
HER SENSES HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY THE PERSON AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LORD FREDERICK SAID MISS WOODLEY TO HERSELF BUT HER UNDERSTANDING COMPELS HER TO SEE HIS FAULTS AND REPROACHES HER PASSION.--AND OH CRIED SHE COULD HER GUARDIAN AND MR SANDFORD KNOW OF THIS CONFLICT HOW MUCH WOULD THEY HAVE TO ADMIRE
IN HER MOMENTS OF LEISURE SHE HAD BEEN TRYING HER HAND UPON DRAMATIC COMPOSITION
BUT SHE WAS NOT PREPARED TO RECEIVE SO POINTED A MARK OF DISAPPROBATION FROM HER YOUNG FRIEND TILL NOW DUTEOUS AND HUMBLE TO HER AS TO A MOTHER AND NOT LESS AFFECTIONATE
FOR HIS POLITENESS WOULD SOMETIMES APPEAR EVEN LIKE THE RESULT OF A SYSTEM WHICH HE HAD MARKED OUT FOR HIMSELF AS THE ONLY MEANS TO KEEP HIS WARD RESTRAINED WITHIN THE SAME LIMITATIONS
IN MY INFANT STATE MY CRUEL FATHER TURNED ME OUT
SHE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE THAT HAUGHTY CHARACTER WHICH HAD INSPIRED SO MANY OF HER ADMIRERS WITH PASSION AND TAKE THE CHANCE OF ITS EFFECT UPON THIS ONLY ONE TO WHOM SHE EVER ACKNOWLEDGED A MUTUAL ATTACHMENT
MISS MILNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD SAID MRS HORTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER
IT WAS SHEWN TO DORRIFORTH
AND IF SHE DID NOT CONFIDE IN YOU WHICH I KNOW AND REJOICE THAT SHE DOES YOU WOULD YET BE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL HER INCLINATIONS I BELIEVE I AM PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM REPLIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A SIGNIFICANCE IN HER VOICE AND MANNER WHICH CONVINCED HIM THERE WAS SOME SECRET TO LEARN
THE TRUTH WAS EARLIER DIVULGED THAN SHE EXPECTED--FOR JUST AS DINNER WAS REMOVED HER FOOTMAN DELIVERED A MESSAGE TO HER FROM HER MILLINER CONCERNING A NEW DRESS FOR THE EVENING--THE PRESENT EVENING PARTICULARLY MARKED
STRACHEY
WITH A TOTAL FORGETFULNESS OF ALL THAT SANDFORD HAD SAID TO PROVOKE THEM
ENCOURAGED NEVERTHELESS BY HER FRIEND IN THE COMMENDABLE DESIRE OF GAINING THE AFFECTIONS OF HIM WHO POSSESSED ALL HER OWN SHE HOWEVER LEFT NO MEANS UNATTEMPTED FOR THE CONQUEST--BUT SHE BEGAN WITH TOO GREAT A CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS NOT TO BE SENSIBLE OF THE DEEPEST MORTIFICATION IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT--NAY SHE ANTICIPATED A DISAPPOINTMENT AS SHE HAD BEFORE ANTICIPATED HER SUCCESS
HER MAID HOWEVER AFTER SOME LITTLE TIME ENTERED THE CHAMBER AND WHISPERED MISS WOODLEY
YET DORRIFORTH WHOSE HEART WAS NOT FORMED AT LEAST NOT EDUCATED FOR LOVE REGARDING HER IN THE LIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP ONLY BEHELD HER AS THE MOST PERFECT MODEL FOR HER SEX
WHAT HAD HE DONE WAS THE FIRST QUESTION TO HIMSELF--"HE HAD OFFENDED SANDFORD."--THE MAN WHOM REASON AS WELL AS PRUDENCE HAD EVER TAUGHT HIM TO RESPECT AND EVEN TO REVERE
SHE UNDERSTOOD HIS THOUGHTS AND GETTING THE BETTER OF HER TEARS APOLOGISED FOR HER WEAKNESS
HER HEALTH AND HAPPINESS ARE IN HIS CARE--MISS MILNER'S ARE IN MINE MR SANDFORD SAID MISS MILNER I AM AFRAID THAT I BEHAVED UNCIVILLY TO YOU LAST NIGHT--WILL YOU ACCEPT OF AN ATONEMENT NO MADAM RETURNED HE I ACCEPT NO EXPIATION WITHOUT AMENDMENT WELL THEN SAID SHE SMILING SUPPOSE I PROMISE NEVER TO OFFEND YOU AGAIN WHAT THEN WHY THEN YOU'LL BREAK YOUR PROMISE DO NOT PROMISE HIM SAID LORD ELMWOOD FOR HE MEANS TO PROVOKE YOU TO IT IN THE LIKE CONVERSATION THE EVENING PASSED AND MISS MILNER RETIRED TO REST IN FAR BETTER SPIRITS THAN HER MORNING'S PROSPECT HAD GIVEN HER THE LEAST PRETENCE TO HOPE
THOUGH HER REST HAD BEEN SOUND IT HAD NOT BEEN REFRESHING--SHE WAS FAR FROM WELL AND SENT WORD OF HER INDISPOSITION AS AN APOLOGY FOR NOT BEING PRESENT AT BREAKFAST
IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO HER OR I WOULD
AT THE SIGHT SHE FLEW FROM THE COMPANY THAT CHANCED TO BE WITH HER AND STOLE TO THE FIRST LONELY CORNER OF THE HOUSE TO CONCEAL HER TEARS--SHE RECLINED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDS AND BEDEWED THEM WITH THE SUDDEN ANGUISH THAT HAD OVERCOME HER
MY LORD TAKE THIS WOMAN'S MARRIAGE VOWS--YOU CAN ASK NO FAIRER PROMISES OF HER REFORM--SHE CAN GIVE YOU NONE HALF SO SACRED HALF SO BINDING
NOR DID HE DENY THAT RESENTMENT CO-OPERATED WITH HIS PRUDENCE
A PASSION COMMENCING INNOCENTLY BUT TERMINATING IN GUILT
DURING THIS INTERIM A TENDER AND COMPLAINING EPISTLE FROM LORD FREDERICK WAS DELIVERED TO MISS MILNER
SHE WAS ONLY ASHAMED THAT WHAT SHE HAD SAID WAS NOT TRUE
ON WHICH SANDFORD TOOK HIS SEAT AGAIN BUT HE STILL FROWNED AND IT WAS MANY MINUTES BEFORE HE CONQUERED HIS ILL HUMOUR
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE INFORMED ME THE GRANT WAS UNDER A CERTAIN RESTRICTION WHICH IF EVER BROKEN I WAS TO SEE HIS THEN DETERMINATION OF WHICH HE ALSO ACQUAINTED ME PUT IN EXECUTION
THUS HE WARNED HER AGAINST SOME AND SELECTED OTHER AUTHORS AS THE MOST CAUTIOUS PRECEPTOR CULLS FOR HIS PUPIL OR A FOND FATHER FOR HIS DARLING CHILD
LORD ELMWOOD AND MISS WOODLEY WERE LEFT ALONE
LOATH TO LEAVE THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS AS TO ENTER THE HOUSE HE REMAINED THERE TILL HE CONSIDERED IT WOULD BE ILL MANNERS IN HIS PRESENT HUMILIATED SITUATION NOT TO SHOW HIMSELF AT THE USUAL SUPPER HOUR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY
AND IF YOU DARE TO GIVE YOUR TONGUE A FREEDOM RUSHBROOK INTERRUPTED HIM--"WHY THEN I BOLDLY SAY AND AS HER FRIEND YOU OUGHT RATHER TO APPLAUD THAN RESENT IT I BOLDLY SAY THAT MY HEART SUFFERS SO MUCH FOR HER SITUATION THAT I AM REGARDLESS OF MY OWN
AND THOUGH I KNELT DOWN TO HIM TO BE HEARD HE HAD NO PITY MATILDA SIGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART AND YET SHE ENVIED THIS POOR MAN WHO HAD BEEN KNEELING TO HER FATHER
BUT THEN TO WHAT PERIL WOULD HE NOT EXPOSE HIMSELF BY SUCH A STEP
A SIMPLE STORY IN FOUR VOLUMES BY MRS
A SIMPLE STORY IN FOUR VOLUMES BY MRS
A SIMPLE STORY IN FOUR VOLUMES BY MRS
A SIMPLE STORY IN FOUR VOLUMES BY MRS
BUT THAT ANY CHANGE INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING HER PASSION WOULD HAVE SERVED ONLY TO INCREASE IT--EVEN A CHANGE TO THE UTMOST POVERTY
SANDFORD AS MUCH AS A HOLY MAN COULD BE WAS ENRAGED AT DORRIFORTH FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE BUT WAS STILL MORE ENRAGED AT HIS WICKEDNESS IN ACCEPTING IT
AND HER SUPPOSED TRIUMPHANT RIVAL WAS TO SANDFORD MORE ODIOUS THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN
AND WILL YOU IN MARRIAGE SHOW ME THAT TENDER LOVE YOU HAVE NOT SHOWN ME YET
SANDFORD THOUGH EXPERIENCED IN THE CRUELTY AND INGRATITUDE OF THE WORLD YET COULD NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BROOK THIS SEVERITY THIS CONTUMELY FROM A MAN FOR WHOSE WELFARE EVER SINCE HIS INFANCY HE HAD LABOURED
AND OH SHE EXCLAIMED COULD I BUT STIMULATE PASSION AGAINST THE COLD INFLUENCE OF PROPRIETY;--DO YOU THINK MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY AND SHE LOOKED WITH SUCH BEGGING EYES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ANSWER AS SHE WISHED DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE UNJUST TO MISS FENTON WERE I TO INSPIRE HER DESTINED HUSBAND WITH A PASSION WHICH SHE MAY NOT HAVE INSPIRED AND WHICH I BELIEVE SHE CANNOT FEEL MISS WOODLEY PAUSED A MINUTE AND THEN ANSWERED NO:"--BUT THERE WAS A HESITATION IN HER MANNER OF DELIVERY--SHE DID SAY NO BUT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WAS AFRAID SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID YES MISS MILNER HOWEVER DID NOT GIVE HER TIME TO RECALL THE WORD OR TO ALTER ITS MEANING BY ADDING OTHERS TO IT BUT RAN ON EAGERLY AND DECLARED AS THAT WAS HER OPINION SHE WOULD ABIDE BY IT AND DO ALL SHE COULD TO SUPPLANT HER RIVAL IN ORDER NEVERTHELESS TO JUSTIFY THIS DETERMINATION AND SATISFY THE CONSCIENCE OF MISS WOODLEY THEY BOTH CONCLUDED THAT MISS FENTON'S HEART WAS NOT ENGAGED IN
SO THE ACQUISITION OF A TITLE AND ESTATE WAS IN MISS MILNER'S EYE AN INESTIMABLE ADVANTAGE TO HER GUARDIAN
TO RELIEVE THE ANXIETY WHICH HER GUARDIAN EXPRESSED SHE ENDEAVOURED TO APPEAR CHEERFUL AND THAT ANXIETY AT LENGTH REALLY MADE HER SO
SOON AFTER DINNER THE LADIES RETIRED
NO MADAM REPLIED HE BUT I UNTHINKINGLY SPOKE OF MY POOR LADY WHO IS DEAD AND GONE MATILDA BURST INTO TEARS
FOR CONSIDER THE ANGUISH THAT IT MAY OCCASION TO MY FRIEND
NEAR FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT TIME JUST AS THE FAMILY WERE GOING TO BED THEY CAME UP TO THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE AND RAPPING VIOLENTLY GAVE THE ALARM OF FIRE CONJURING ALL THE INHABITANTS TO MAKE THEIR WAY OUT IMMEDIATELY AS THEY WOULD SAVE THEIR LIVES
YOU CAN I AM SURE SAY NOTHING BUT WHAT I MUST FORGIVE BUT SHE MADE THIS REPLY WITH A DISTANCE AND A RESERVE VERY UNLIKE THE USUAL MANNERS OF MISS WOODLEY
HERE SANDFORD WITH LITTLE INCONVENIENCE VISITED THEM
IF I MAY JUDGE MISS MILNER THERE ARE MANY MORE TO A YOUNG LADY OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAN IF YOU WERE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A HUSBAND MY FATHER MR DORRIFORTH THOUGHT YOUR PROTECTION SUFFICIENT BUT THAT PROTECTION WAS RATHER TO DIRECT YOUR CHOICE THAN TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR NOT CHOOSING AT ALL
SHE THEREFORE SAID HE HAS SENT FOR YOU
AND AS YOU TEMPTED YOU WILL BE THE MOST LIKELY TO DISSUADE HER
BID THE MAN DRIVE FASTER--IT WILL BE DARK BEFORE WE GET HOME YOU WILL SHOOT TO-MORROW MY LORD CERTAINLY HOW DOES MR SANDFORD DO SIR I DID NOT SEE HIM NOT SEE MR SANDFORD MY LORD
YET LET NOT OUR OVER-SCRUPULOUS READERS BE MISLED AND EXTEND THEIR IDEA OF HER VIRTUE SO AS TO MAGNIFY IT BEYOND THAT WHICH FRAIL MORTALS COMMONLY POSSESS
YES ANSWERED HE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO MISS FENTON YOUR BETROTHED HUSBAND IS A PARTY CONCERNED
HE LOOKED DOWN ON THE CARPET--TWITCHED HIMSELF UPON HIS CHAIR--AND BEGAN TO TALK OF THE WEATHER
HE LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY AND CRIED AH
AND AS LORD ELMWOOD DESIGNED TO LEAVE LONDON SOME TIME IN JUNE HE ADVISED HIM TO GO TO ELMWOOD HOUSE A WEEK OR TWO BEFORE HIM
BUT HE RETURNED AN ANSWER TO RECOMPENCE HER FOR ALL SHE HAD SUFFERED ON THE OCCASION
THAT SHE FLEW FROM THE PRESENT TEDIOUS SOLITUDE TO THE DANGEROUS SOCIETY OF ONE WHOSE WHOLE MIND DEPRAVED BY FASHIONABLE VICES COULD NOT REPAY HER FOR A MOMENT'S LOSS OF HIM WHOSE ABSENCE HE SUPPLIED
FOR HE WAS SURE HE HAD LEFT IT THERE WHEN HE WENT OUT THE SERVANT WITHDREW TO ENQUIRE AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE VOLUME IN HIS HAND AND MISS WOODLEY'S COMPLIMENTS SHE BEGS YOUR PARDON SIR SHE DID NOT KNOW THE BOOK WAS YOURS AND HOPES YOU WILL EXCUSE THE LIBERTY SHE TOOK MISS WOODLEY CRIED RUSHBROOK WITH SURPRISE SHE COMES SO SELDOM INTO THESE APARTMENTS I DID NOT SUPPOSE IT WAS HER WHO HAD IT--TAKE IT BACK TO HER INSTANTLY WITH MY RESPECTS AND I BEG SHE WILL KEEP IT THE MAN WENT
AND ALTHOUGH MISS WOODLEY HAD THE BEST OF DISPOSITIONS AND UPON EVERY OCCASION SPOKE THE STRICTEST TRUTH YET IN RELATING THIS OCCURRENCE SHE DID NOT SPEAK ALL THE TRUTH
MISS WOODLEY AND SHE SAT DOWN THAT DAY TO DINNER IN THEIR RETIRED APARTMENTS WHICH WERE DETACHED FROM THE OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE BY A GALLERY
NEVER PERPLEX HER MIND WITH AN IDEA THAT MAY DISTURB BUT CANNOT REFORM"--WERE HIS LATEST WORDS
I WILL REVEAL TO MR DORRIFORTH WITHOUT HESITATION THE REAL STATE OF YOUR HEART
WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF HIS THUS TRIFLING WITH ME SANDFORD REPLIED MY LORD YOUNG MEN ARE FREQUENTLY ROMANTIC IN THEIR NOTIONS OF LOVE AND THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A SINCERE AFFECTION WHERE THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS DO NOT FIRST POINT OUT THE CHOICE IF HE IS IN LOVE ANSWERED LORD ELMWOOD LET HIM TAKE THE OBJECT AND LEAVE MY HOUSE AND ME FOR EVER
HIS EXCUSES WERE RECEIVED AND THE SUBJECT CEASED
WHO UNSUSPECTING WHY SHE ASKED READILY INFORMED HER THE INTENDED LADY ELMWOOD WAS NO OTHER THAN MISS FENTON
THE ATMOSPHERE IS VAGUE AND NEUTRAL THE ACTION PASSES AMONG ILL-DEFINED SITTING-ROOMS AND THE MOST POIGNANT SCENE IN THE STORY TAKES PLACE UPON A STAIRCASE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DESCRIBED
EVEN HER INFANT DAUGHTER SHE LEFT BEHIND NOR WOULD ALLOW HERSELF THE CONSOLATION OF HER INNOCENT THOUGH REPROACHFUL SMILES--SHE LEFT HER IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER HIS PROTECTION
NOW TOO THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER WAS COME AND IT WAS EXPECTED HER FATHER WOULD SOON QUIT THE COUNTRY
AND MISS MILNER'S EVERY LIMB FELT AGONIZING TORMENT WHEN MISS FENTON COURTED AND BELOVED BY LORD ELMWOOD WAS PRESENT TO HER IMAGINATION
SHE BLUSHED AND HER LOOKS WOULD HAVE CONFIRMED HER GUILTY IF THE UNEMBARRASSED AND FREE TONE OF HER VOICE MORE THAN HER WORDS HAD NOT PRESERVED HER FROM THAT SENTENCE
ONE AUTHOR HE COMPLAINED WAS TOO LIGHT ANOTHER TOO DEPRESSING AND PUT THEM ON THE SHELVES AGAIN
BUT IT WAS NOT COMPLETELY WRITTEN UNTIL 1790 AND NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR
MRS HORTON SECRETLY ENJOYED THIS SCENE THOUGH THE REAL WELL MEANING OF HER HEART AND EASE OF HER CONSCIENCE DID NOT SUFFER HER TO THINK SO
THOSE ASSURED HIM THERE WAS NOTHING TO APPREHEND UNDER THIS HEAD AS FROM THE BEHAVIOUR OF LORD ELMWOOD TO HIS CHILD IT WAS MORE THAN PROBABLE HE WOULD BE UTTERLY INDIFFERENT AS TO ANY VIOLENCE THAT MIGHT BE OFFERED HER
BUT BEFORE HIS COUNTENANCE COULD SATISFY HER HER THOUGHTS WERE CALLED AWAY FROM THAT TRIVIAL MATTER AND AGAIN FIXED UPON LORD ELMWOOD
AND YET THE OBJECT IS AS UNCONSCIOUS OF MY LOVE TO THIS MOMENT AS YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN
LORD ELMWOOD DID NOT STAY UPON THIS VISIT ABOVE THREE HOURS AT ELMWOOD HOUSE
WHEN THE SERVANT CAME UP WITH SOMETHING BY WAY OF SUPPER HE TOLD MR SANDFORD THAT HIS LORD WAS RETURNED FROM HIS WALK AND HAD ENQUIRED FOR HIM
SHE LISTENED SOMETIMES WITH TEARS SOMETIMES WITH HOPE BUT ALWAYS WITH AWE AND WITH TERROR TO EVERY SENTENCE IN WHICH HER FATHER WAS CONCERNED
HE HAD VISITORS WHO PASSED A WEEK OR TWO WITH HIM
AND AS HIS UNCLE'S ESTATE IS NEAR OUR RESIDENCE HE WILL NOT THEN SO EVIDENTLY FOLLOW HER AS HE WOULD IF I COULD INDUCE HER TO GO NOW IT WAS AGREED THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE
THE COLOUR HAD MOUNTED INTO MISS MILNER'S FACE FROM THE WARMTH WITH WHICH SHE HAD DELIVERED HER OPINION AND HIS ACCIDENTAL ENTRANCE AT THE VERY MOMENT THIS PRAISE HAD BEEN CONFERRED UPON HIM IN HIS ABSENCE HEIGHTENED THE BLUSH TO A DEEP GLOW ON EVERY FEATURE--CONFUSION AND EARNESTNESS CAUSED EVEN HER LIPS TO TREMBLE AND HER WHOLE FRAME TO SHAKE
IT WAS PAST TWELVE WHEN LORD ELMWOOD LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND RISING FROM HIS CHAIR WENT UP TO MRS HORTON AND TAKING HER HAND SAID TILL I SEE YOU AGAIN MADAM I SINCERELY WISH YOU EVERY HAPPINESS MISS MILNER FIXED HER EYES UPON THE TABLE BEFORE HER
I MAY HAVE BEEN TOO SEVERE AND ADDED PERHAPS TO HER UNEASINESS
HER HUSBAND WAS THIRTY-SEVEN WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM A ROMAN CATHOLIC LIKE HERSELF AND AN ACTOR WHO DEPENDED FOR HIS LIVING UPON ILL-PAID AND UNCERTAIN PROVINCIAL ENGAGEMENTS
SHE ENTERED GRAVE MAJESTIC AND APPARENTLY SERENE WHILE HER POOR HEART FLUTTERED WITH A THOUSAND DISTRESSING SENSATIONS
SO MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY AS SOON AS THEY MET IN THE APARTMENT YOU DID NOT COME TO US NO ANSWERED HE I WAS SORRY
BY THAT INNOCENCE IN WHICH YOU ONCE LIVED BE COMFORTED--BY THE SORROWS YOU HAVE KNOWN SINCE YOUR DEGRADATION HOPE THAT IN SOME MEASURE YOU HAVE ATONED----BY THE SINCERITY THAT SHONE UPON YOUR YOUTHFUL FACE WHEN I JOINED YOUR HANDS AND THOSE THOUSAND VIRTUES YOU HAVE SINCE GIVEN PROOFS OF TRUST THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN TO DIE THE DEATH OF THE WICKED AS HE SPOKE THESE WORDS OF CONSOLATION HER TREMBLING HAND CLASPED HIS--HER DYING EYES DARTED A RAY OF BRIGHTNESS--BUT HER FAILING VOICE ENDEAVOURED IN VAIN TO ARTICULATE
SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE THROUGH HER SELF-SACRIFICE TO KEEP FROM WANT A LARGE BAND OF POOR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS
THEM TO WHOM SHE HAD SO OFTEN PROTESTED THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST ATTACHMENT TO LORD FREDERICK BUT FROM MOTIVES OF VANITY
AND SO I HAD RATHER COME AND TAKE A BIT WITH YOU MATILDA AS IF SHE HAD SEEN HIS HEART AS HE SPOKE CLUNG ROUND HIS NECK AND SOBBED ON HIS BOSOM
HE WOULD SPURN ME FOR A COWARD
BUT UNTIL HIS LORDSHIP AND I HAVE HAD A PRIVATE CONFERENCE OR YOU CONDESCEND TO DECLARE YOUR SENTIMENTS MORE FULLY IN REGARD TO HIS VISITS I THINK IT MY DUTY TO PUT AN END TO THEM YOU WILL ALWAYS PERFORM YOUR DUTY MR DORRIFORTH I HAVE NO DOUBT WHETHER I CONCUR OR NOT YET BELIEVE ME MADAM I SHOULD PERFORM IT MORE CHEERFULLY IF I COULD HOPE THAT IT WAS SANCTIONED BY YOUR INCLINATIONS I AM NOT MISTRESS OF MY INCLINATIONS SIR OR THEY SHOULD CONFORM TO YOURS PLACE THEM UNDER MY DIRECTION AND I WILL ANSWER FOR IT THEY WILL A SERVANT CAME IN--"LORD FREDERICK IS RETURNED SIR AND SAYS HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SHEW HIM INTO THE STUDY CRIED DORRIFORTH HASTILY AND RISING FROM HIS CHAIR LEFT THE ROOM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE JOY OF MR SANDFORD'S PRESENCE ONCE MORE TO CHEER THEIR SOLITARY DWELLING
HOWEVER TIME AND A SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS MAY ERADICATE MORE TENDER SENTIMENTS I AM SURE NEVER TO LOSE THE LIVELIEST ANXIETY FOR YOUR WELFARE--AND WITH ALL THAT SOLICITUDE WHICH CANNOT BE DESCRIBED I ENTREAT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE FOR MINE--WHEN WE SHALL BE FAR ASUNDER--AND FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR DEAD FATHER'S MEMORY THAT UPON EVERY IMPORTANT OCCASION YOU WILL CALL YOUR SERIOUS JUDGMENT TO DIRECT YOU I AM MADAM YOUR SINCEREST FRIEND ELMWOOD AFTER SHE HAD READ EVERY SYLLABLE OF THIS LETTER IT DROPPED FROM HER HANDS
FOR IN SPITE OF MRS INCHBALD'S ARTIFICIALITIES IN SPITE OF HER LACK OF THAT KIND OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION WHICH SEEMS TO MODERN READERS THE VERY BLOOD AND BREATH OF A GOOD STORY SHE HAS THE POWER OF DOING WHAT AFTER ALL ONLY A VERY FEW INDEED OF HER FELLOW CRAFTSMEN HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO--SHE CAN BRING INTO HER PAGES THE LIVING PRESSURE OF A HUMAN PASSION SHE CAN INVEST IF NOT WITH REALISM WITH SOMETHING GREATER THAN REALISM--WITH THE SENSE OF REALITY ITSELF--THE PAINS THE TRIUMPHS AND THE AGITATIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART
AND THIS LEARNED JESUIT FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT THE MIND OF WOMAN WAS FAR ABOVE OR RATHER BENEATH HIS COMPREHENSION IT WAS SO INDEED--FOR WITH ALL HIS PENETRATION AND FEW EVEN OF THAT SCHOOL HAD MORE HE HAD NOT YET PENETRATED INTO THE RECESSES OF MISS MILNER'S HEART
MY BROTHER GEORGE'S DEATH AND AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH DR GISBORNE--NOT HAPPY
TO LAY HER HEART OPEN AND CREDIT MINE WHEN I DECLARE TO HER THAT I HAVE NO VIEW IN ALL THE ADVICE I GIVE TO HER BUT HER IMMEDIATE WELFARE MR DORRIFORTH YOU KNOW MY OPINION OF THAT LADY REPLIED SANDFORD
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN BY BIRTH AND ONE WHO HAD KEPT THE BEST COMPANY--A MAN OF SENSE AND LEARNING
MISS FENTON LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED HAS A BROTHER WITH HER
IS IT NOT THE PROMISE YOU GAVE ME THEN YOU DO NOT THINK OF ANY CONSEQUENCE YES CERTAINLY IF YOU DO I DO AND MEAN PERHAPS TO MAKE IT OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN IT DESERVES BY BEING OFFENDED WHETHER OR NOT I AM OFFENDED--YOU SHALL FIND I AM AND HE LOOKED SO
FOR AS HE HAD BEFORE GIVEN HIS DAUGHTER IN SOME MEASURE TO HIS CHARGE
ALL HER FORMER AGITATIONS NOW RETURNED
HE HAS MORE POWER THAN I HAVE HE HAS NOT ENOUGH THEN REPLIED EDWARDS FOR HE WAS IN THE ROOM WITH MY LORD WHEN WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU HAPPENED AND DID HE SAY NOTHING ASKED SANDFORD
ACCUSTOMED TO BE AWED BY EVERY SERIOUS LOOK OF HIS SHE YET RESISTED THIS
AND THIS LITTLE BOUNTY JUST OBTAINED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GREATER IN HER MOTHER'S ESTIMATION THAN IT WAS NOW IN HERS
THIS HABIT MAY BECOME SO POWERFUL THAT HE CANNOT THROW IT OFF EVEN IF HIS FORMER RESOLUTIONS SHOULD URGE HIM TO IT
HIS RESIDENCE THERE FROM VARIOUS ACCIDENTS PROLONGED FROM TIME TO TIME TILL NEAR THREE YEARS HAD AT LENGTH PASSED AWAY
AND NO SOONER HAD THE WINE FREELY CIRCULATED THAN THIS WAS ALWAYS THE EXPEDIENT WHICH APPEARED BY FAR THE BEST
IN OUR FORMER CONVERSATION CONTINUED THE EARL I GAVE YOU BUT A WEEK TO DETERMINE--THERE HAS I THINK ELAPSED SINCE THAT TIME HALF A YEAR ABOUT AS MUCH SIR THEN SURELY YOU HAVE NOW MADE UP YOUR MIND I HAD DONE THAT AT FIRST MY LORD--IF IT HAD MET WITH YOUR CONCURRENCE YOU WISHED TO LEAD A BACHELOR'S LIFE I THINK YOU SAID RUSHBROOK BOWED
MISS WOODLEY SOMETHING RECOVERED FROM HER FIRST SURPRISE AND SUFFERINGS--FOR NEVER DID HER SUSCEPTIBLE MIND SUFFER SO EXQUISITELY--AMIDST ALL HER GRIEF AND ABHORRENCE FELT THAT PITY WAS STILL PREDOMINANT--AND RECONCILED TO THE FAULTS OF MISS MILNER BY HER MISERY SHE ONCE MORE LOOKED AT HER WITH FRIENDSHIP AND ASKED WHAT SHE COULD DO TO RENDER HER LESS UNHAPPY MAKE ME FORGET REPLIED MISS MILNER EVERY MOMENT OF MY LIFE SINCE I FIRST SAW YOU--THAT MOMENT WAS TEEMING WITH A WEIGHT OF CARES UNDER WHICH I MUST LABOUR TILL MY DEATH AND EVEN IN DEATH REPLIED MISS WOODLEY DO NOT HOPE TO SHAKE THEM OFF
AND THEY DID NOT EXTEND SO FAR AS TO REACH POOR RUSHBROOK
AND I THINK IF HE LOVES YOU NOW HE HAS YET THE GOOD SENSE TO KNOW THAT HE HAS REASON TO HATE YOU WHAT HAS GOOD SENSE TO DO WITH LOVE RETURNED MISS MILNER--"IF A LOVER OF MINE SUFFERS HIS UNDERSTANDING TO GET THE BETTER OF HIS AFFECTION THE SAME ARGUMENTS WERE GOING TO BE REPEATED
HE YET WISHED FOR THE ALLIANCE HE HAD PROPOSED
THE THIRD LETTER FROM MILNER LODGE BROUGHT THE NEWS OF LORD ELMWOOD'S DEATH
BUT SOME SPIRITS LESS TIMID THAN MINE MIGHT PERHAPS ADVISE YOU TO THE EXPERIMENT NOT FOR WORLDS RETURNED MATILDA NO COUNSEL COULD TEMPT ME TO SUCH TEMERITY--AND YET TO ENTERTAIN THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE I COULD DO THIS IS A SOURCE OF INFINITE COMFORT THIS CONVERSATION LASTED TILL BED TIME AND LATER
BUT THE SAME QUALITY IS TO BE FOUND THROUGHOUT HER WORK
BUT YOU HAVE DONE MORE--YOU HAVE DARED TO VISIT HER--TO FORCE INTO HER PRESENCE AND SHOCK HER WITH YOUR OFFERS OF SERVICES WHICH SHE SCORNS
MISS WOODLEY'S LOVE TO HER FRIEND RENDERED HER LITTLE OTHERWISE
BUT LORD ELMWOOD UNMOVED FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIM WHICH PURSUED HIM WITH ENRAGED LOOKS TO THE END OF THE ROOM
BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP SAW TWO SEDAN CHAIRS GOING OUT OF THIS HOUSE I CANNOT BUT SUSPECT IT MUST BE MISS MILNER AND MY NIECE GOING TO THE MASQUERADE HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY
THAT SHE WILL BE DENIED IT IS IN THIS PLACE PROPER TO REMARK THAT MR MILNER WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH OF ROME BUT ON HIS MARRIAGE WITH A LADY OF PROTESTANT TENETS THEY MUTUALLY AGREED THEIR SONS SHOULD BE EDUCATED IN THE RELIGIOUS OPINION OF THEIR FATHER AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN THAT OF THEIR MOTHER
AT BREAKFAST WHICH HAD JUST BEGUN AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS CHAPTER THE CONVERSATION WAS LIVELY ON THE PART OF MISS MILNER WISE ON THE PART OF DORRIFORTH GOOD ON THE PART OF MISS WOODLEY AND AN ENDEAVOUR AT ALL THREE ON THE PART OF MRS HORTON
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE CLAIMS OF OBLIGATION TO THE FATHER AND TENDER ATTACHMENT TO THE DAUGHTER HIS ILLNESS WAS INCREASED BY THE TORTURES OF HIS MIND AND HE ONCE SINCERELY WISHED FOR THAT DEATH OF WHICH HE WAS IN DANGER TO FREE HIM FROM THE DILEMMA IN WHICH HIS AFFECTIONS HAD INVOLVED HIM
SANDFORD CHOSE THE EVENING RATHER TO STEAL INTO THE HOUSE PRIVATELY THAN BY ANY APPEARANCE OF PARADE TO SUFFER LORD ELMWOOD TO BE REMINDED OF THEIR ARRIVAL BY THE PUBLIC PRINTS OR BY ANY OTHER ACCIDENT
THERE WERE OCCASIONAL VISITS FROM THE NOW TRIUMPHANT MRS SIDDONS
WHO WOULD THINK IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO SLANDER SO UNIMPORTANT A PERSON AS I AM THE MAN WHO HAS THE CHARGE OF MISS MILNER REPLIED LORD FREDERICK DERIVES A CONSEQUENCE FROM HER NO ILL CONSEQUENCE I HOPE MY LORD SAID DORRIFORTH WITH A FIRMNESS IN HIS VOICE AND WITH AN EYE SO FIXED THAT HIS ANTAGONIST HESITATED FOR A MOMENT IN WANT OF A REPLY--AND MISS MILNER SOFTLY WHISPERING TO HIM AS HER GUARDIAN TURNED HIS HEAD TO AVOID AN ARGUMENT HE BOWED ACQUIESCENCE
WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID IT AWAY
WHEN BY THE SUDDEN WINDING OF THE STAIRCASE,--LORD ELMWOOD WAS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HER
HOW LITTLE TO CONDEMN WITH SUCH FRIENDLY THOUGHTS AND WITH THE PUREST INTENTIONS MISS WOODLEY DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE BOTH GENTLEMEN REASON TO BELIEVE A CONTENTION OF THIS NATURE WAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF MISS MILNER'S MIND
AND SHE WAS TO ENTREAT THE LADY TO SEND A PRESSING INVITATION THAT SHE WOULD PASS A MONTH OR TWO AT HER HOUSE
SHE AND MATILDA LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER
NOW LORD ELMWOOD IS GOING AWAY FOR EVER HE IS NOT AFRAID OF YOUR SEEING HIM ONCE AGAIN AND SHE THOUGHT SHE PRAISED HIM BY THIS SUGGESTION
YET THE MORE FAVOURABLE HER OPINION OF HIS MIND AND MANNERS THE MORE HE BECAME AN OBJECT OF HER JEALOUSY FOR THE AFFECTIONS OF LORD ELMWOOD AND HE WAS NOW CONSEQUENTLY AN OBJECT OF GREATER SORROW TO HER THAN WHEN SHE BELIEVED HIM LESS WORTHY
SHE STROVE TO OVERCOME THAT GRIEF AND AFTER A HEAVY SIGH SAT DOWN AS IF RESIGNED TO THE FATE TO WHICH SHE WAS DECREED
AND HAS BEEN SITTING UP WITH MR SANDFORD WAITING FOR YOU SHE WAS WIDE AWAKE IMMEDIATELY
WHY THEN MISS WOODLEY SAID MISS MILNER YOU SHALL HAVE THE PRESENT
MISS MILNER STARTED AT THE SOUND--SO DID HE--BUT SHE HAD NEARLY DROPPED HER CUP AND SAUCER
THOUGH LADY ELMWOOD MY LORD LEFT NO WILL BEHIND HER SHE LEFT A REQUEST A REQUEST SAID HE STARTING IF IT IS FOR ME TO SEE HER DAUGHTER I TELL YOU NOW BEFORE YOU ASK THAT I WILL NOT GRANT IT--FOR BY HEAVEN AND HE SPOKE AND LOOKED MOST SOLEMNLY THOUGH I HAVE NO RESENTMENT AGAINST THE INNOCENT CHILD AND WISH HER HAPPY YET I WILL NEVER SEE HER
BUT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD HAVE THE IMPRUDENCE TO SPEAK A WORD UPON THE SUBJECT WHICH EMPLOYED HER THOUGHTS OR EVEN TO LOOK AS IF SHE THOUGHT OF IT AT ALL
LADY MATILDA ONCE ASKED HIM--"ARE YOU CERTAIN MR SANDFORD YOU MADE NO MISTAKE IN RESPECT TO WHAT LORD ELMWOOD SAID WHEN HE GRANTED MY MOTHER'S REQUEST
THE COMPLAINT OF THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD IN THE SCRIPTURES A LESSON I HAVE STUDIED HAS MADE THIS WISH CLING SO FAST TO MY HEART THAT WITHOUT THE DISTANT HOPE OF ITS BEING FULFILLED DEATH WOULD HAVE MORE TERRORS THAN MY WEAK MIND COULD SUPPORT
THEN AS HE GAZED ON THE EARL CONTEMPLATED THE JOY HE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN IN CLASPING IN HIS ARMS A CHILD LIKE MATILDA WHOSE TENDERNESS REVERENCE AND DUTY HAD DEPRIVED HER OF ALL SENSATION AT HIS SIGHT
FROM HIM THE CARE OF HER EDUCATION HAD BEEN WITH-HELD AS HE KEPT INVIOLATE HIS PROMISE TO HER DEPARTED MOTHER ON THE ARTICLE OF RELIGION AND THEREFORE CONSIGNED HIS DAUGHTER TO A BOARDING-SCHOOL FOR PROTESTANTS WHENCE SHE RETURNED WITH MERELY SUCH IDEAS OF RELIGION AS LADIES OF FASHION AT HER AGE MOSTLY IMBIBE
SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LIFE
AND I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO SEE YOU UPON THIS OCCASION
HE WAS STRUCK WITH THESE SUDDEN SIGNALS
THE FOUR SMALL VOLUMES OF THESE EARLY EDITIONS WITH THEIR LARGE TYPE THEIR AMPLE SPACING THEIR CHARMING FLAVOUR OF ANTIQUITY DELICACY AND REST--MAY BE MET WITH OFTEN ENOUGH IN SECLUDED CORNERS OF SECONDHAND BOOKSHOPS OR ON SOME NEGLECTED SHELF IN THE LIBRARY OF A COUNTRY HOUSE
LORD ELMWOOD AFTER FOUR YEARS ENJOYMENT OF THE MOST PERFECT HAPPINESS THAT MARRIAGE COULD GIVE AFTER BECOMING THE FATHER OF A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER WHOM HE LOVED WITH A TENDERNESS ALMOST EQUAL TO HIS LOVE OF HER MOTHER WAS UNDER THE INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF LEAVING THEM BOTH FOR A TIME IN ORDER TO RESCUE FROM THE DEPREDATION OF HIS OWN STEWARD HIS VERY LARGE ESTATES IN THE WEST INDIES
ALL THE FATAL EFFECTS OF SACRILEGIOUS LOVE
ENCOURAGED BY THE QUESTION AND THE AGITATION OF HIM WHO ASKED IT THE POOR MAN GAVE WAY TO HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH EVERY SIGN OF SORROW I SAW HER MY LORD TAKEN AWAY BY FORCE--TWO RUFFIANS SEIZED AND CARRIED HER AWAY WHILE SHE SCREAMED IN VAIN TO ME FOR HELP AND TORE HER HAIR IN DISTRACTION MAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED THE EARL
BUT WHEN TIME SHALL HAVE ERADICATED BEFORE HE COULD PROCEED FURTHER MATILDA WAS ONCE MORE SUNK INTO DESPONDENCY AND SCARCE ATTENDED TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING
DEAR MR DORRIFORTH DO NOT ASK ME ANY THING ABOUT MISS MILNER--WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS VERY YOUNG
SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SAW LORD ELMWOOD
THE LATTER TURNED AND SEEMED AGAIN TO DESIRE THE PERSON TO RETIRE BUT IN VAIN
AND IF HE SHOULD ASK FOR ME I WILL GLADLY COME YOU KNOW
I AM NOT WELL MR RUSHBROOK SAID MATILDA LANGUIDLY
FOR WHERE WE HOPE FOR NOTHING WE RECEIVE SMALL INDULGENCIES WITH JOY
BUT THE MANNER WAS THE MATERIAL PART
ROSE LATE DRESSED AND READ IN THE BIBLE ABOUT DAVID C."--THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REFERENCES IN HER DIARY TO ANYTHING APPROACHING A RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE DURING MANY YEARS
AND WHEN WE TRANSGRESS AGAINST IT KNOWINGLY WE JUSTLY INCUR OUR PUNISHMENT
AND YET THAT IS BUT TOO LIKELY IF HE PROVOKES ME SIR REPLIED SANDFORD I WILL SPEAK TO HIM YET ADDED LORD ELMWOOD STERNLY DO NOT URGE WHAT YOU SAY FOR MY SAKE BUT FOR HIS--I CAN PART FROM HIM WITH EASE--BUT HE MAY THEN REPENT AND YOU KNOW REPENTANCE ALWAYS COMES TOO LATE WITH ME MY LORD I WILL EXERT ALL THE EFFORTS IN MY POWER FOR HIS WELFARE
SHE WISHES TO DRAW A ROUGH MAN SANDFORD AND SHE DRAWS A RUDE ONE
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD YOUR COMPANY TO-DAY
AS SANDFORD APPROACHED STILL NEARER TO LORD ELMWOOD HE CONTINUED NO MY LORD I KNOW YOU DO NOT SUSPECT ME OF PARTIALITY TO MR RUSHBROOK--HAS ANY PART OF MY BEHAVIOUR EVER DISCOVERED IT YOU NOW THEN ONLY INTERFERE TO PROVOKE ME IF THAT WERE THE CASE RETURNED SANDFORD THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS WHEN I MIGHT HAVE DONE IT MORE EFFECTUALLY--WHEN MY OWN HEART-STRINGS WERE BREAKING BECAUSE I WOULD NOT PROVOKE OR ADD TO WHAT YOU SUFFERED I AM OBLIGED TO YOU MR SANDFORD HE RETURNED MILDLY
NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
AFTER A THOUSAND FEARS MUCH CONFUSION AND EMBARRASSMENT HE AT LENGTH FRANKLY CONFESSED HIS HEART WAS ENGAGED AND HAD BEEN SO LONG BEFORE HIS UNCLE OFFERED TO DIRECT HIS CHOICE LORD ELMWOOD DESIRED TO KNOW ON WHOM HE HAD PLACED HIS AFFECTIONS I DARE NOT TELL YOU MY LORD RETURNED HE INFINITELY CONFUSED
AND BADE HER BUT IT WAS NOT IN A CHEERING TONE NOT BE AFRAID THIS GAVE HER NO CONFIDENCE
NOT SO MUCH TO DEPRECATE THE DOOM HE SAW IMPENDING AS THUS HUMBLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT WAS HIS DUE
AND HAVING NOW NO ESSENTIAL GOOD TO EXPECT HOPE THAT WILL NEVER TOTALLY EXPIRE CLUNG AT THIS CRISIS TO LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SHE HOPED MOST FERVENTLY THE TERMS OF THE LETTER MIGHT NOT BE HARSH BUT THAT LORD ELMWOOD HAD DELIVERED HIS COMMANDS IN GENTLE LANGUAGE
1799
1799
1799
1799
AND THUS THE TIME STOLE AWAY TILL IT WAS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS FROM THE TIME THAT HE HAD ARRIVED
A VERY UNFORTUNATE MAN INDEED MR SANDFORD REPEATED HE ALTHOUGH YOU TREAT MY COMPLAINT CONTEMPTUOUSLY SANDFORD MADE NO REPLY AND SEEMED ABOVE MAKING ONE
NOR DID HE DEEM THIS ONE OF HIS GREATEST FAULTS KNOWING THE DEMAND UPON HIS PARTIALITY FROM ANOTHER OBJECT
NO WONDER THAT AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE IT SHOULD BE GONE
IN VAIN HOWEVER SHE ATTEMPTED TO WALK TO HER GUARDIAN'S APARTMENT--SHE SUNK AS BEFORE AND WAS TAKEN TO A SETTEE WHILE MISS WOODLEY WAS DISPATCHED TO BRING HIM TO HER
THOUGH PERHAPS SUCH AN HONOUR MIGHT CONSTITUTE ONE OF HER FIRST WISHES--SHE BEHAVED TO HER BUT AS SHE CONSTANTLY BEHAVED TO EVERY OTHER HUMAN CREATURE--THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO GAIN THE ESTEEM OF A PERSON POSSESSED OF AN UNDERSTANDING EQUAL TO MISS MILNER'S--SHE HAD PENETRATION TO DISCOVER MISS WOODLEY'S UNAFFECTED WORTH AND WAS SOON INDUCED TO REWARD IT WITH THE WARMEST FRIENDSHIP
IN OUR LAST CONVERSATION DID YOU NOT SAY SO AT FIRST I DID MY LORD--BUT YOU PERMITTED ME TO CONSULT MY HEART MORE CLOSELY
BUT A SUDDEN FROWN FROM DORRIFORTH HAVING PUT AN END TO IT HE RESUMED HIS USUAL POLITENESS AND SAID I WISH YOU WOULD SHEW A BETTER TASTE THAN THUS POINTEDLY TO DISAPPROVE OF SIR EDWARD HOW MR DORRIFORTH CAN YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE PROOFS OF A GOOD TASTE WHEN SIR EDWARD WHOM YOU CONSIDER WITH SUCH HIGH ESTEEM HAS GIVEN SO BAD AN EXAMPLE OF HIS IN APPROVING ME DORRIFORTH WISHED NOT TO FLATTER HER BY A COMPLIMENT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOUGHT FOR AND FOR A MOMENT HESITATED WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE
THIS AFFECTING INTRODUCTION BEING OVER AFTER SOME MINUTES PASSED IN GENERAL CONVERSATION THE CARRIAGES WERE AGAIN ORDERED
YET WHEN HE FOUND HER IN HIS ARMS HE STILL HELD HER THERE--GAZED ON HER ATTENTIVELY--AND ONCE PRESSED HER TO HIS BOSOM
MISS WOODLEY WAS EXCESSIVELY UNEASY AND WITH CAUSE
ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO-DAY
AND THOUGH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BID HER FAREWELL HE DREW HER GENTLY ON ONE SIDE AND SAID WITH THE TENDEREST CONCERN MY DEAR MISS MILNER WE PART FRIENDS?--I HOPE WE DO?--ON MY SIDE DEPEND UPON IT THAT I REGRET NOTHING SO MUCH AT OUR SEPARATION AS HAVING EVER GIVEN YOU A MOMENT'S PAIN I BELIEVE SO WAS ALL SHE COULD UTTER FOR SHE HASTENED FROM HIM LEST HIS DISCERNING EYE SHOULD DISCOVER THE CAUSE OF THE WEAKNESS WHICH THUS OVERCAME HER
THINK WHAT A TASK I UNDERTAKE FOR YOUR SAKE AND HIS WHEN I CONDEMN MYSELF TO EXPLAIN TO HIM YOUR WEAKNESS
AND IN THAT PURSUIT HE WAS MORE RAPID IN HIS SUCCESS THAN EVEN IN PROCURING ESTEEM
WHEREAS OF RELIGIOUS VOWS BROKEN BY A DEVOTEE SHE HAD NEVER HEARD
BUT IN HER OLD AGE HER VIEWS CHANGED
AND THUS THE ONLY PERSONS DEAR TO HER SHE LEFT BUT AT LORD ELMWOOD'S PLEASURE TO BE PRESERVED FROM PERISHING IN WANT
IN THE FEATURES OF HER FATHER SHE WAS PROUD TO DISCERN THE EXACT MOULD IN WHICH HER OWN APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MODELLED
NOT EXACTLY MY LORD--I TOLD YOU BEFORE I DID NOT
THE EARL HOWEVER LOITERED AND DID NOT ONCE SEEM IN HASTE TO BE GONE
BUT IN MY MORE ADVANCED AGE YOU WILL FIND THE TASK TOO DIFFICULT SANDFORD AGAIN REPEATED HE SHOULD NOT PRESUME TO WHICH LORD ELMWOOD AGAIN MADE ANSWER DO NOT SANDFORD AND ADDED FOR I HAVE A SINCERE REGARD FOR YOU AND SHOULD BE LOATH AT THESE YEARS TO QUARREL WITH YOU SERIOUSLY SANDFORD TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD TO CONCEAL HIS FEELINGS
WHICH INCREASED AS HE PARTED FROM HER TO CONVULSIVE SOBS
AND HER SHORTCOMINGS ARE BORN NOT OF WEAKNESS BUT OF EXCESS OF STRENGTH
AS YOU MY LORD FROM HABIT SO OFTEN DO THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT LOVE IS NOT IN MY NATURE NO MORE OF IT MY LORD THAN HABIT COULD VERY SOON EXTINGUISH BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE IT EXTINGUISHED--I WOULD RATHER IT SHOULD MOUNT TO A FLAME FOR I THINK IT A CRIME TO BE INSENSIBLE OF THE DIVINE BLESSINGS LOVE CAN BESTOW THEN YOU INDULGE THE PASSION TO AVOID A SIN?--THIS VERY MOTIVE DETERS MR DORRIFORTH FROM THAT INDULGENCE IT OUGHT TO DETER HIM FOR THE SAKE OF HIS OATHS--BUT MONASTICK VOWS LIKE THOSE OF MARRIAGE WERE MADE TO BE BROKEN--AND SURELY WHEN YOUR GUARDIAN LOOKS AT YOU HIS WISHES ARE NEVER LESS PURE SHE REPLIED EAGERLY THAN THOSE WHICH DWELL IN THE BOSOM OF MY CELESTIAL GUARDIAN AT THAT INSTANT DORRIFORTH ENTERED THE ROOM
BY THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT IT AS WELL AS BY THE ADDRESS SHE KNEW IT CAME FROM LORD ELMWOOD AND LAID IT DOWN UPON HER TOILET AS IF SHE WAS FEARFUL TO UNFOLD IT
NO MY DEAR RETURNED LADY EVANS I NEVER HEARD OF A PAD TO MAKE STRAIGHT AN ILL-SHAPEN DISPOSITION OH YES ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY GOOD COMPANY GOOD BOOKS EXPERIENCE AND THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS MAY HAVE MORE POWER TO FORM THE MIND TO VIRTUE THAN MISS WOODLEY WAS NOT PERMITTED TO PROCEED FOR LADY EVANS RISING HASTILY FROM HER SEAT CRIED I MUST BE GONE--I HAVE AN HUNDRED PEOPLE WAITING FOR ME AT HOME--BESIDES WERE I INCLINED TO HEAR A SERMON I SHOULD DESIRE MR DORRIFORTH TO PREACH AND NOT YOU JUST THEN MRS HILLGRAVE WAS ANNOUNCED
MY SUPERIORS ARE VERY INDULGENT FOR THEY DISPENSE WITH ALL MY DUTIES
EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
THE MISERIES THAT LADY IS PREPARING FOR YOU HUNG UPON HER EARS LIKE THE NOTES OF A RAVEN AND SOUNDED EQUALLY OMINOUS
WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED DORRIFORTH LOOKING WITH CONCERN ON HER DISCOMPOSURE
FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S SAKE HOWEVER SHE THOUGHT IT RIGHT SOMETIMES TO SHEW HERSELF BEFORE HIM
FOR HAD YOU BEEN SO RASH AS TO HAVE RETURNED YOUR OPPONENT'S FIRE NOT ALL MY INTEREST AT ROME WOULD HAVE OBTAINED REMISSION OF THE PUNISHMENT MISS MILNER THROUGH ALL HER TEARS COULD NOT NOW RESTRAIN HER LAUGHTER
THESE LADIES HEARD WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION THAT DINNER HAD BEEN SERVED BUT MET MISS MILNER AT THE TABLE WITH A LESS DEGREE OF PLEASURE THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED
IN CONSEQUENCE HER MELANCHOLY HUMOUR WAS NOW PREDOMINANT
MISS WOODLEY'S OWN SENTIMENTS HAD UPBRAIDED HER BEFORE
THERE WAS ONE OBJECT HOWEVER AMONG ALL SHE SAW WHICH ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION ABOVE THE REST AND SHE WOULD STAND FOR HOURS TO LOOK AT IT
HER BROTHER ON WHOM HER FORTUNE DEVOLVED IF SHE TOOK THIS RESOLUTION WAS EXACTLY OF HER OPINION
SHE RISES LANGUID AND DISORDERED AND AT BREAKFAST ADDS FRESH PAIN TO DORRIFORTH BY HER ALTERED APPEARANCE
BUT MY DEAR MISS MILNER WE WILL TALK UPON SOME OTHER TOPIC AND NEVER RESUME THIS AGAIN--WE DIFFER IN OPINION I DARE SAY ON ONE SUBJECT ONLY AND THIS DIFFERENCE I HOPE WILL NEVER EXTEND ITSELF TO ANY OTHER
THIS WAS AN ESTATE HE RARELY VISITED
EVEN SANDFORD WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO HER BEHAVIOUR AND IN RETURN WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM WISHED HER A GOOD NIGHT TO HER AND MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD NOT BEEN WITNESSES OF THE PRECEDING CONVERSATION WHAT SHE HAD DONE APPEARED OF NO MERIT
BUT MISS MILNER DECLARED BOTH TO HIM AND TO HER FRIEND THAT LOVE HAD AT PRESENT GAINED NO INFLUENCE OVER HER MIND
AND HANGS UPON HER NECK AS IF SHE WISHED TO CLING THERE NOT TO BE PARTED EVEN BY THE GRAVE
BUT HE HAD SO MUCH PITY FOR HIS PRESENT WEAK STATE TO DELAY THAT FURTHER INQUIRY WHICH HE HAD THREATENED BEFORE HIS ILLNESS TO A TIME WHEN HE SHOULD BE ENTIRELY RESTORED
AND HE SEEMED AS IF INCLINED TO LISTEN WHEN SANDFORD CALLED OUT IN A TONE OF VOICE SO HARSH MISS WOODLEY WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"--SHE GAVE A START AND DESISTED
AND HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO REFLECT THAT HE WAS BESTOWING UPON THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS THE TENDEREST PROOF OF HIS REGARD BY ABSENTING HIMSELF ENTIRELY FROM HER SOCIETY
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU PETITIONED FOR I ASKED HIM CRIED RUSHBROOK TREMBLING FOR A WIFE HER HAND WHICH HAD JUST THEN TAKEN HOLD OF HIS IN THE WARMTH OF HER WISH TO SERVE HIM NOW DROPPED DOWN AS WITH THE STROKE OF DEATH--HER FACE LOST ITS COLOUR--AND SHE LEANED AGAINST THE DESK BY WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD
BUT WHICH HE HAD NO DOUBT WOULD BE ACCOMMODATED IN THE MOST AMICABLE MANNER
NOR TILL SUFFERANCE HAD TEMPTED HER BEYOND HER USUAL BOUNDS DID HE REMONSTRATE
I DO NOT INTEND IT REPLIED SHE TREMBLING EXTREMELY
BUT SANDFORD THE MOST WITH WHOM HE HAD NOT SPOKEN FOR MANY DAYS BEFORE HE LEFT THE COUNTRY FOR HIS ALLUSION TO THE WRETCHED SITUATION OF HIS DAUGHTER.--AND SANDFORD WITH HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS NOW SAW HIM TREAT THAT DAUGHTER WITH AN EASY A NATURAL FONDNESS AS IF SHE HAD LIVED WITH HIM FROM HER INFANCY
DO YOU REMEMBER IT OR DO YOU NOT YES MY LORD I DO AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER RUSHBROOK PAUSED AGAIN
DEPEND UPON IT THEN CRIED SANDFORD THAT HER AFFECTIONS ARE ENGAGED
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME I SHALL TALK WITH YOU AGAIN AND I COMMAND YOU TO BE THEN PREPARED TO SPEAK NOT ONLY WITHOUT DECEIT BUT WITHOUT HESITATION HE LEFT THE ROOM AT THESE WORDS AND LEFT RUSHBROOK RELEASED FROM A FATE WHICH HIS APPREHENSIONS HAD BEHELD IMPENDING THAT MOMENT
SHE HAD INDEED WON FOR HERSELF A POSITION WHICH CAN HARDLY BE PARALLELED AMONG THE WOMEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY--A POSITION OF INDEPENDENCE AND HONOUR BASED UPON TALENT AND UPON TALENT ALONE
HE FEARED THAT HE HAD TREATED HER WITH TOO MUCH SEVERITY--HE ADMIRED HER CONDESCENSION ACCUSED HIMSELF FOR HAVING EXACTED IT--HE LONGED TO ASK HER PARDON--HE DID NOT KNOW HOW
AND IF IT HAD BEEN MADE KNOWN AT A LATER IT MUST ONLY HAVE BEEN BY LETTER OR BY THE DEPUTATION OF MR SANDFORD WHO THEY KNEW HAD BEEN ONCE IN THE COUNTRY TO VISIT HER
NOT THAT I CAN FORESEE
THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER APPEARED A FAVOURABLE TIME HAD HE BEEN SO INCLINED TO HAVE RECALLED THIS DECLARATION WHICH HE HAD SOLEMNLY AND REPEATEDLY MADE--SHE WAS NOW DESTITUTE OF THE PROTECTION OF HER OTHER PARENT AND IT BECAME HIS DUTY AT LEAST TO PROVIDE HER A GUARDIAN IF HE DID NOT CHUSE TO TAKE THAT TENDER TITLE UPON HIMSELF--BUT TO MENTION EITHER THE MOTHER OR CHILD TO LORD ELMWOOD WAS AN EQUAL OFFENCE AND PROHIBITED IN THE STRONGEST TERMS TO ALL HIS FRIENDS AND HOUSEHOLD
SANDFORD DURING BREAKFAST BY ACCIDENT CAST A GLANCE UPON MISS MILNER
THE DISTINCTION WHICH BOTH REQUIRED WAS THUS BY HIS SKILFUL MANAGEMENT ALONE PRESERVED
THE NEXT DAY RUSHBROOK DINED ALONE WHILE SANDFORD GAVE HIS COMPANY TO THE LADIES
WHO LIKE HER WOULD LANGUISH IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SOLITUDE THESE THINGS AND A THOUSAND SUCH A THOUSAND TIMES REPEATED SHE STILL LISTENED TO WITH PLEASURE
BLESSED SPIRIT OF MY MOTHER LOOK DOWN AND REJOICE CHAPTER VII
HALF EXPIRING WITH HER SUFFERINGS OF BODY AS WELL AS OF MIND ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NEXT NIGHT AFTER SHE WAS BORNE AWAY MATILDA ARRIVED
HE NEVERTHELESS REPLIED WITH WARMTH DO
BUT THIS HARSH SENTENCE HURRIED HER BEYOND ALL BOUNDS AND SHE AROSE FROM HER SEAT IN THE MOST VIOLENT AGITATION EXCLAIMING WHAT HAVE I DONE TO BE THUS TREATED THOUGH MR SANDFORD WAS NOT A MAN EASILY INTIMIDATED HE WAS UPON THIS OCCASION EVIDENTLY ALARMED
AND THE DEAR-BOUGHT EXPERIMENT OF BEING LOVED IN SPITE OF HER FAULTS A GLORY PROUD WOMEN EVER ASPIRE TO WAS AT PRESENT THE AMBITION OF MISS MILNER
WHERE CAN BE THE JOY THE PRIDE OF INSPIRING A PASSION WHICH FIFTY OTHERS CAN EQUALLY INSPIRE STRANGE CRIED MISS WOODLEY THAT YOU WHO POSSESS SO MANY FOLLIES INCIDENT TO YOUR SEX SHOULD IN THE DISPOSAL OF YOUR HEART HAVE SENTIMENTS SO CONTRARY TO WOMEN IN GENERAL MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY RETURNED SHE PUT IN COMPETITION THE LANGUID ADDRESSES OF A LIBERTINE WITH THE ANIMATED AFFECTION OF A SOBER MAN AND JUDGE WHICH HAS THE DOMINION
AND THEN WALKING WITH A VERY CEREMONIOUS AIR UP TO MISS MILNER SAID HE HOPED SHE WAS PERFECTLY RECOVERED MRS HORTON BEGGED HER TO MIND WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT SHE REPLIED I AM MUCH BETTER SIR HE THEN RETURNED TO SANDFORD AGAIN
AND NO LONGER SUFFERING UNDER THE AGONY OF RESTRAINT SHE GAVE WAY TO HER HUMOUR AND LAUGHED WITH A LIBERTY SO UNCONTROLLED THAT SOON LEFT HER IN THE ROOM WITH NONE BUT THE TENDER-HEARTED MISS WOODLEY A WITNESS OF HER FOLLY
ONE MISFORTUNE HOWEVER INTERFERED WITH HER HAPPINESS--A DEFECT OF UTTERANCE WHICH DURING HER EARLY YEARS RENDERED HER SPEECH SO INDISTINCT AS TO BE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO STRANGERS
PLAYS WRITTEN BY MRS
ON THIS HE PAID HER A COMPLIMENT IN RETURN
DORRIFORTH WAS CONFUSED--BUT THE CONCERN WHICH SHE HAD SO PLAINLY EVINCED FOR HIS GOOD OPINION THROUGHOUT ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN SAYING SILENCED ANY REBUKE HE MIGHT ELSE HAVE GIVEN HER FOR THIS UNWARRANTABLE CHARGE AGAINST HIS FRIEND
AND AS I AM DEBARRED FROM THAT RESOURCE WHAT CAN I DO BUT STAND BEFORE HIM LIKE A GUILTY CREATURE ACKNOWLEDGING MY FAULTS SHE AGAIN ENTREATED HER FRIEND TO GO WITH HER
I THOUGHT SIR RETURNED RUSHBROOK YOU SPOKE LANGUIDLY--I BEG YOUR PARDON I HAVE THE HEAD-ACHE A LITTLE ANSWERED HE:--THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT BRUSHED THE POWDER FROM IT AND AS HE PUT IT ON AGAIN FETCHED A MOST HEAVY SIGH
IN THE LAST-MENTIONED SITUATION SHE WAS SHORTER IN STATURE THAN IN THE FORMER--SHE WAS PALER--SHE WAS THINNER--AND A VERY DIFFERENT CONTOUR PRESIDED OVER HER WHOLE AIR AND ALL HER FEATURES
BUT SHE WAS NOT TO GO UNPROTECTED FOR LONG
FOR PERCEIVING SANDFORD WAS OFFENDED AT WHAT HAD PASSED AS THE ONLY MEANS OF RETRIBUTION HE BEGAN HIMSELF TO LAMENT HER VOLATILE AND CAPTIOUS PROPENSITIES
MORE ESPECIALLY LADY MATILDA WHOSE FORLORN STATE AND INNOCENT SUFFERINGS HAD EVER EXCITED HIS COMPASSION AND CAUSED HIM TO TREAT HER WITH AFFECTION TENDERNESS AND RESPECT
NOR WILL I SUFFER MYSELF TO BE AGAIN PREPOSSESSED IN HER FAVOUR BY YOUR PREJUDICE AGAINST HER--FOR I BELIEVE IT WAS COMPASSION AT YOUR UNKIND TREATMENT THAT FIRST GAINED HER MY HEART I MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD
LORD ELMWOOD CONTINUED
SANDFORD KNEW THE HEARTS OF WOMEN AS WELL AS THOSE OF MEN THOUGH HE HAD PASSED LITTLE OF HIS TIME IN THEIR SOCIETY--HE SAW MISS MILNER'S HEART AT THE FIRST VIEW OF HER PERSON
OR IF THERE WAS ANY TOKEN THAT SHEWED HE REMEMBERED THE CIRCUMSTANCE AT ALL IT WAS THE PUTTING HIS GLASS TO HIS NEPHEW'S WHEN RUSHBROOK CALLED FOR WINE AND DRINKING AT THE TIME HE DID
SANDFORD WENT ON----"I KNOW NO TIE--NO BOND--NO INNOCENCE THAT IS A PROTECTION WHEN YOU FEEL RESENTMENT YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF A HANDSOME PERSON AND WAS WHAT HIS NEIGHBOURS CALLED A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WAS AN EXCELLENT FOX-HUNTER AND AS EXCELLENT A COMPANION OVER HIS BOTTLE AT THE END OF THE CHACE--HE WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS FORTUNE WHERE HIS PLEASURES WERE CONCERNED AND AS THOSE PLEASURES WERE CHIEFLY SOCIAL HIS SPORTING COMPANIONS AND HIS MISTRESSES FOR THESE WERE ALSO OF THE PLURAL NUMBER PARTOOK LARGELY OF HIS WEALTH
NO SOONER HAS SHE DRIVEN AWAY THIS PAINFUL IMAGE THAN SHE IS AGAIN AWAKENED BY BEHOLDING HER GUARDIAN AT HER FEET SUEING FOR PARDON
AS THE CARRIAGE MOVED SLOWLY THROUGH A LANE BETWEEN ELMWOOD CASTLE AND HER OWN HOUSE ON CASTING HER EYES OUT OF THE WINDOW MISS MILNER'S COUNTENANCE WAS BRIGHTENED IN AN INSTANT AND THAT INSTANT LORD FREDERICK ON HORSE-BACK WAS AT THE COACH DOOR AND THE COACHMAN STOPPED
HE WAS GOING TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS
BUT RUSHBROOK WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR TO BE OFFENDED AND HE SENT AGAIN BEGGING HE WOULD ADMIT HIM
THE FEW DAYS THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN THIS AND THEIR LAWFUL MARRIAGE WERE PASSED IN THE DELIGHTFUL CARE OF PREPARING FOR THAT HAPPY DAY--YET WITH ALL ITS DELIGHTS INFERIOR TO THE FIRST WHEN EVERY UNEXPECTED JOY WAS DOUBLED BY THE ONCE EXPECTED SORROW
AND SHE WITH EQUAL CARE AVOIDED HIS
AND FROM WHAT EMOTION SHE COULD NOT TELL SHE STOPPED SHORT HALF RESOLVED TO TURN BACK
AND PRAY MY LORD SAID SHE WHEN DO YOU GO TO FRANCE TO ITALY YOU MEAN;--I SHALL NOT GO AT ALL SAID HE
NOR DO I RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT ITS CONTENTS ARE AND HE HELD IT OUT TO HIM
DID HE SEEM GLAD TO SEE YOU ASKED MATILDA
NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE NOW IMPENDING TO AGITATE HER HEART SHE FELT MORE FORCIBLY ITS EMBARRASSMENT AT MEETING ON TERMS OF EASY INTERCOURSE HIM OF WHOM SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO THINK BUT WITH THAT DISTANT REVERENCE AND FEAR WHICH HIS SEVERITY HAD EXCITED
THIS IDEA WAS NO SOONER FORMED THAN EXECUTED
MISS MILNER DID NOT SUPPOSE HIM SUCH AND SHE TURNED PALE WHEN HIS NAME WAS UTTERED
II
GIFFARD SAYS HE LOVES ME CONTINUED SHE AND DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT YET BE BROUGHT TO FORGIVE ME FORGIVE YOU CRIED SANDFORD
AND AS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WHATEVER SHE PLEASED TO SAY SHOULD BE ADMIRED
WHILE HE ADJOURNED THE COURT TO GO TO DINNER
SHE KNOWS NOT THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE OF RUMINATING NOR WHY SHE DWELLS UPON THAT MORE THAN UPON ALL THE REST BUT IT WILL GIVE PLACE TO NONE
AS SOON AS THEY WITHDREW INTO ANOTHER APARTMENT SHE REMEMBERED MISS WOODLEY
NO ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MORTALS WAS IN MISS WOODLEY'S OPINION BINDING LIKE THAT ENTERED INTO WITH HEAVEN
BUT IT GIVES ME CONCERN TO THINK WE MUST PART THEN LET US BE JOINED CRIED HE FALLING AT HER FEET TILL DEATH ALONE CAN PART US ALL THE SENSIBILITY--THE RESERVE--THE PRIDE WITH WHICH SHE WAS SO AMPLY POSSESSED RETURNED TO HER THAT MOMENT
BUT MISS WOODLEY THE DAY FOLLOWING COMMUNICATED THE INTELLIGENCE OF THIS VISIT TO MR SANDFORD WHO NOT BEING PRESENT AND A WITNESS OF THOSE MARKS OF HUMILITY AND RESPECT WHICH WERE CONSPICUOUS IN THE DEPORTMENT OF MR RUSHBROOK WAS HIGHLY OFFENDED AT HIS PRESUMPTION AND THREATENED IF HE EVER DARED TO FORCE HIS COMPANY THERE AGAIN HE WOULD ACQUAINT LORD ELMWOOD WITH HIS ARROGANCE WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE EVENT
AS MISS WOODLEY WAS DEPRIVED OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF DESIRING RUSHBROOK NOT TO WRITE WHEN HE ASKED HER THE PERMISSION HE PASSED ONE WHOLE MORNING IN THE GRATIFICATION OF FORMING AND WRITING A LETTER TO HER WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE SHEWN TO MATILDA
THE SOCIETY SHE MIXED WITH WAS VARIOUS BUT FOR THE MOST PART OBSCURE
NO REPLIED MISS MILNER SINCE LORD ELMWOOD HAS THOUGHT PROPER TO TAKE HIS LEAVE OF ME WITHOUT EVEN SPEAKING A WORD
IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE PUBLIC PAPERS AND BY THAT MEANS FIRST CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE
AND NOW AGAIN HE WISHED TO LEAVE HER IN THIS SENSELESS STATE THAT NOT REMEMBERING WHAT HAD PASSED SHE MIGHT ESCAPE THE PUNISHMENT
AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT SUMMIT OF HER WISHES WHICH ANNIHILATES HOPE BUT THAT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING MISS WOODLEY AND MR SANDFORD STILL KEPT THIS PASSION IN EXISTENCE
AND HE WAS HURT TO THE GREATEST DEGREE AT THIS RESPECT OR RATHER CONTEMPT SHOWN TO HIM BY HER RETREAT
RUSHBROOK SOON LEARNED THE NEWS THAT MATILDA WAS GONE AND ELMWOOD HOUSE WAS TO HIM A DESERT--HE SAW THERE NO REAL FRIEND OF HER'S EXCEPT POOR SANDFORD AND TO HIM RUSHBROOK KNEW HIMSELF NOW MORE DISPLEASING THAN EVER
YET WITH RESENTMENT ON HIS FACE HE WIPED A TEAR OF JOY FROM HIS EYE FOR THE BOY'S SAKE--HIS FROWN WAS THE FORCE OF PREJUDICE HIS TEAR THE FORCE OF NATURE
OF REFLECTION
HE IS GOING TO BE SECOND TO MR DORRIFORTH WHO MEANS THIS VERY EVENING TO BE KILLED BY MY LORD FREDERICK OR TO KILL HIM IN ADDITION TO THE BLOW THAT HE GAVE HIM LAST NIGHT MRS HORTON EXCLAIMED IF MR DORRIFORTH DIES HE DIES A MARTYR MISS WOODLEY CRIED WITH FERVOUR HEAVEN FORBID MISS FENTON CRIED DEAR ME WHILE MISS MILNER WITHOUT UTTERING ONE WORD SUNK SPEECHLESS ON THE FLOOR
THE AUTHORITY IN HIS LOOKS AS WELL AS IN THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS
ADDING IT IS MY CONCERN FOR LADY MATILDA WHICH MAKES ME THUS INDISPOSED
THAT WAS A SIGN HE WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU WAS IT NOT SAID MATILDA
DO NOT READ IT YET SAID MISS WOODLEY
SHE IS A FLIRT AND A FLIRT NOT ONLY ADORABLE BUT WORTHY OF ADORATION
EXCEPT THAT HIS LORDSHIP TOOK NO KIND OF NOTICE OF HER LADYSHIP THAT APPEARED LIKE LOVE RUSHBROOK WAS ALL UNEASINESS AND ANXIETY TO KNOW THE PARTICULARS OF WHAT HAD PASSED
LORD RAVENSHAW IN CORNWALL AND WHICH AFTER ALL WAS NOT PERFORMED AT SIR THOMAS BERTRAM'S
BUT THOUGH OLD AND A PRIEST I CAN SUBMIT TO THINK I HAVE BEEN IN AN ERROR
AND ALL HIS OVERTURES OF ATONEMENT HE AT THIS TIME FOUND MORE AND MORE INEFFECTUAL
SHE IS NOT GONE THERE HE CRIED
IN WHICH LONG PERIOD SANDFORD WITH ALL HIS PENETRATION COULD NEVER CLEARLY DISCOVER WHETHER HE HAD ONCE CALLED TO MIND THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE
BUT HAUGHTY IMPATIENT IMPERIOUS AND MORE THAN EVER IMPLACABLE CHAPTER VIII
FOR WHEN THE SUBJECT AROSE AS IT FREQUENTLY DID MISS WOODLEY'S UNDISGUISED HEART AND SANDFORD'S UNDISGUISED COUNTENANCE TOLD THEM INSTANTLY
AND SHE RECEIVED HIS FREQUENT APOLOGIES FOR NOT RETURNING WITH A SUSPICION AND RESENTMENT THEY WERE CALCULATED BUT NOT INTENDED TO INSPIRE
THE FATE I HAVE DRAWN UPON MYSELF HE SHALL FIND I CAN BE RESIGNED TO
THESE ARE PLEASURES A LORD ENJOYS BUT IN COMMON WITH HIS VALET
SANDFORD FOLLOWED SLOW BEHIND AS IF HE HAD FOLLOWED AT HER FUNERAL
FOR THEIR OWN GENERATION THEY REPRESENTED A DISTINGUISHED TITLE TO FAME
AND WHAT AGITATED HIM INFINITELY MORE LADY MATILDA WAS WITH THEM
BUT IF HE APPEARED NOT ABSOLUTELY AVERSE TO A RECONCILIATION TO OFFER IT IN SO CAUTIOUS A MANNER THAT IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT FARTHER UNEASINESS ON EITHER SIDE
IF LADY MATILDA RESUMED HE I HAVE OFFENDED YOU AND MUST QUIT YOU WITHOUT PARDON I AM MORE UNHAPPY THAN I SHOULD BE WITH THE LOSS OF YOUR FATHER'S PROTECTION--MORE FORLORN THAN WHEN AN ORPHAN BOY YOUR MOTHER FIRST TOOK PITY ON ME AT THIS LAST SENTENCE MATILDA TURNED HER EYES ON MISS WOODLEY AND SEEMED IN DOUBT WHAT REPLY SHE WAS TO GIVE
FOR HER SAKE--AS I SUPPOSE LORD ELMWOOD MAY HAVE TOLD YOU--I THIS MORNING RASHLY THREW MYSELF INTO THE PREDICAMENT FROM WHENCE YOU RELEASED ME--FOR HER SAKE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH--FOR HER SAKE I HAVE HAZARDED A GREAT DEAL AND AM STILL READY TO HAZARD MORE BUT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE DO NOT RETURNED SANDFORD DRILY
OF THE MAN IN WHOSE JUDGMENT IT WAS MY DELIGHT TO BE APPROVED--ABOVE ALL I HAVE DRAWN UPON MYSELF THE STINGS OF MY CONSCIENCE WHERE SHALL I PASS THIS SLEEPLESS NIGHT CRIED HE WALKING REPEATEDLY ACROSS HIS CHAMBER
AFTER A HESITATION IT IS FAR FROM ME REPLIED HE TO WISH TO BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE PRIVATE SENTIMENTS OF THOSE WHO DESIRE TO WITH-HOLD THEM FROM ME
LORD ELMWOOD SHOOK HIM BY THE HAND AS UPON ALL OTHER MEETINGS
SHE THEREFORE FREQUENTLY WALKED ABOUT THE HOUSE WHILE HE WAS IN IT NOT INDEED ENTIRELY WITHOUT RESTRAINT BUT AT LEAST WITH THE SHOW OF LIBERTY
BE PREPARED TO QUIT LONDON WITHOUT ANY MARKS OF REGRET IN A FEW DAYS SHE BOWED ASSENT
HER EYES LOST THEIR BRILLIANCY HER LIPS SEEMED TO HANG WITHOUT THE POWER OF MOTION HER HEAD DROOPED AND HER DRESS WAS NEGLECTED
AND LORD FREDERICK'S SUPPOSITION WAS NOT VERY ERRONEOUS IF HE MISTOOK THIS GRATITUDE FOR A LATENT SPARK OF AFFECTION
JAN
JAN
AND SUCH A MAN SLIGHTS ME WITHOUT KNOWING IT SHE SAID--FOR SHE HAD NOT DIVED SO DEEPLY INTO THE POWERS OF SIMULATION AS TO SUSPECT THAT SUCH CARELESS MANNERS WERE THE RESULT OF ART
AND YET AS MATILDA PASSED ALONG NEVER TO HER DID THE SUN SHINE SO BRIGHT AS UPON THIS MORNING--NEVER DID HER IMAGINATION COMPREHEND THAT THE HUMAN HEART COULD FEEL HAPPINESS TRUE AND GENUINE AS HERS
THAT CARE I LEAVE TO YOU--AND SHOULD THERE BE ANY COMPLAINTS ON YOU THEY FALL SANDFORD BOWED AND WAS GOING
BUT THIS IMPORTANT SECRET I LONG WISHED AND ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL
WHEN RUSHBROOK HURT AT RECEIVING NO SECOND MESSAGE SAID I AM AFRAID SIR YOU DID VERY WRONG WHEN YOU FIRST TOOK THIS BOOK FROM MISS WOODLEY IT WAS NOT FROM HER I TOOK IT SIR REPLIED THE MAN IT WAS FROM LADY MATILDA SINCE HE HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE RUSHBROOK HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD THE NAME OF LADY MATILDA HE WAS SHOCKED--CONFOUNDED MORE THAN EVER--AND TO CONCEAL WHAT HE FELT INSTANTLY ORDERED THE MAN OUT OF THE ROOM
DORRIFORTH WAS ALL ANXIETY THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER JOURNEY SHOULD BE COMMODIOUS
THE COLOUR ROSE IN HIS FACE--HIS EYE DARTED LIGHTNING--AND HIS HAND WAS LIFTED UP WITH THE EMOTION THAT WORD HAD CREATED
IS THIS YOUR FRIENDSHIP YES--AND THE TRUEST FRIENDSHIP I HAVE TO BESTOW
HE WROTE LETTERS TO SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS AND ONE TO HIS WARD IN WRITING WHICH HE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY PRESERVE THE USUAL FIRMNESS OF HIS MIND
FOR BY THAT NAME ALONE IS HE DEAR TO ME NAY MISS MILNER WITH WHAT RAPTURE DID YOU NOT RECEIVE HIS LOVE AS LORD ELMWOOD BUT UNDER THIS TITLE HE HAS BEEN BARBAROUS
THE MUSES I TRUST WILL PARDON ME THAT TO THEM I DO NOT FEEL MYSELF OBLIGED--FOR IN JUSTICE TO THEIR HEAVENLY INSPIRATIONS I BELIEVE THEY HAVE NEVER YET FAVOURED ME WITH ONE VISITATION
BUT I AM NOT PERMITTED TO TELL HER SO NOR CAN I HOPE MISS WOODLEY YOU WILL SHE REPLIED YOU ARE RIGHT SIR NOR DID SHE REVEAL THIS CONVERSATION WHILE NOT A SENTENCE THAT PASSED EXCEPT THAT WAS OMITTED
THE BELL AT THAT MOMENT RANG FURIOUSLY AND THEY HASTENED THEIR STEPS TO THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT WHERE LORD ELMWOOD WAS
SANDFORD OBSERVED THIS AND WITHOUT RESERVE ADDED TO THE LIST OF HER OTHER FAILINGS HYPOCRISY
MRS HORTON WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE ADDITION THIS ACQUISITION TO HER FAMILY WAS LIKELY TO MAKE TO HER ANNUAL INCOME AND STYLE OF LIVING
NOR DID HE AT THIS TIME FIND HIS DISPOSITION SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE TO EXACT FROM THE YOUNG MAN A COMPLIANCE WITH HIS WISHES AT SO CRUEL AN ALTERNATIVE AS THAT OF BEING FOR EVER DISCARDED
IT WAS THE END OF MAY BEFORE RUSHBROOK WAS ABLE TO PARTAKE IN THE USUAL ROUTINE OF THE DAY--THE COUNTRY WAS NOW PRESCRIBED HIM AS THE MEANS OF COMPLETE RESTORATION
UPON WHICH THAT NOBLEMAN HAVING ANSWERED A FEW QUESTIONS AND GIVEN A FEW SIGNIFICANT HINTS THAT HE WAS ENTRUSTED WITH A SECRET FRANKLY CONFESSED WHAT HE HAD PROMISED TO CONCEAL
THEN SANDFORD TURNING TO LORD ELMWOOD SHOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND CRIED MY LORD I THANK YOU--I THANK YOU VERY KINDLY MY LORD--I SHALL NOW BEGIN TO THINK I HAVE SOME WEIGHT WITH YOU YOU MIGHT INDEED THINK SO DID YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HAVE PARDONED WHAT WAS HIS OFFENCE MY LORD SUCH AS I WOULD NOT HAVE FORGIVEN YOU OR ANY EARTHLY BEING BESIDES HIMSELF--BUT WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING IN HIS BEHALF I RECOLLECTED THERE WAS A GRATITUDE SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THE HAZARDS HE RAN THAT ALMOST MADE HIM PARDONABLE I GUESS THE SUBJECT THEN CRIED SANDFORD
SHE LONGED TO GO UPON THE STAGE
FOR IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE SANDFORD'S SPIRITS WERE UNUSUALLY CAST DOWN
HE APPEARED IN HER EYES AS IN MISS WOODLEY'S THE SAME AS EVER
WHERE'S LADY ELMWOOD MISS WOODLEY SMILED AND ANSWERED--SHE WAS GONE WITH SUCH AND SUCH LADIES TO AN AUCTION
RUSHBROOK JUST NOW MORE HOPELESS THAN EVER OF FORMING AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH LADY MATILDA BEGAN TO GIVE WAY TO SYMPTOMS OF DESPONDENCY
SHE DIED IN AN OBSCURE KENSINGTON BOARDING-HOUSE ON AUGUST 1 1821
NO SOONER WAS THE LONG EXPECTED DEATH OF LADY ELMWOOD ARRIVED THAN HE WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE TO HEAR THAT LADY MATILDA WAS SENT FOR AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY HER FATHER
YET AGAIN HER PITIABLE SITUATION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS COMPASSION AND HER BEAUTEOUS PERSON TO HIS LOVE
MY LORD REPLIED MISS WOODLEY A GOOD DEAL AFFECTED I SINCERELY HOPE MY PRAYERS FOR YOUR HAPPINESS MAY BE HEARD SHE AND MRS HORTON WERE BOTH STANDING AS WELL AS LORD ELMWOOD
SHE WROTE TO MISS WOODLEY TO BEG HER CONTRIVANCE TO REPROACH HER FOR KEEPING THE SECRET SO LONG FROM HER AND TO THANK HER FOR HAVING REVEALED IT IN SO KIND A MANNER AT LAST
NOR COULD THE SECRET HOPE THAT WHISPERED HIM THEIR BLESSINGS MIGHT ONE DAY BE MUTUAL INCREASE THE PLEASURE HE FOUND IN BEHOLDING MATILDA HAPPY
WHEN CHRISTMAS ARRIVED LORD ELMWOOD HAD MANY CONVIVIAL DAYS AT ELMWOOD HOUSE BUT MATILDA WAS NEVER MENTIONED BY ONE OF HIS GUESTS AND MOST PROBABLY WAS NEVER THOUGHT OF
AND I COMMAND YOU AT YOUR PERIL TO DESIST AT MY PERIL
MISS MILNER TAKING MISS WOODLEY WITH HER WENT DIRECTLY TO HER OWN APARTMENT AND THERE EXCLAIMED IN RAPTURE HE IS MINE--HE LOVES ME--AND HE IS MINE FOR EVER MISS WOODLEY CONGRATULATED HER UPON BELIEVING SO BUT CONFESSED SHE HERSELF HAD HER FEARS WHAT FEARS CRIED MISS MILNER
AND GIVING WAY TO THAT IRRITABLE DISPOSITION WHICH SHE HAD SO SELDOM GOVERNED RESOLVED IN SPITE OF HIS INJUNCTIONS TO DIVERT THE MELANCHOLY HOURS CAUSED BY HIS ABSENCE BY MIXING IN THE GAY CIRCLES OF LONDON
LORD ELMWOOD NOW BECAME JUST THE SAME BEFORE HER AS BEFORE OTHERS
BUT HE APPREHENDED MISS WOODLEY'S INTENTION AND EVIDENTLY SHUNNED HER
AND HAD NOT THE WATCHFUL EYE OF MISS WOODLEY STOOD GUARD OVER HER INCLINATIONS SHE HAD PLAINLY DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS ENRAPTURED WITH THE JOY OF SEEING HIM AGAIN HIMSELF AFTER THE DANGER TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED
LORD ELMWOOD WAS SENSIBLE OF THE EMBARRASSMENT HIS PRESENCE GAVE MISS WOODLEY AND UNDERSTOOD THE REPROACHES WHICH SHE SEEMED TO VENT UPON HERSELF IN SILENCE
ALL EXQUISITE OF THEIR KIND FOR EXQUISITE WERE THE FEELINGS OF HER SUSCEPTIBLE HEART
AND DO I ENTERTAIN A HOPE
MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY THEN CRIED MISS MILNER AFTER RECOVERING HERSELF I AM AFRAID YOU WILL NOT FORGIVE ME NO INDEED I WILL NOT RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
AND LOST TO EVERY IMPORTANT COMFORT SHE FELT GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR THIS SMALL ONE
THE APPREHENSIONS TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED KEPT HER TIMID AND DOUBTFUL--SHE FEARED TO SPEAK OR CLASP HIM IN RETURN FOR HIS EMBRACE BUT FALLING ON HER KNEES CLUNG ROUND HIS LEGS AND BATHED HIS FEET WITH HER TEARS.----THESE WERE THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS THAT SHE HAD EVER KNOWN--PERHAPS THE HAPPIEST HE HAD EVER KNOWN
MISS MILNER NOT HAVING SPIRITS TO GO ABROAD PASSED THE EVENING AT HOME
THE DAY AT LENGTH CAME ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD WAS EXPECTED TO DINNER
NEVER WAS THERE A MORE RAPID CHANGE FROM DESPAIR TO HAPPINESS--TO HAPPINESS PERFECT AND SUPREME--THAN WAS THAT WHICH MISS MILNER AND LORD ELMWOOD EXPERIENCED IN ONE SINGLE HOUR
CHAPTER XI
CHAPTER XI
CHAPTER XI
LORD ELMWOOD ASKED MISS MILNER--"IF SHE MEANT TO RIDE THIS DELIGHTFUL DAY WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOMEN SAID SANDFORD DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE TO MRS HORTON THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME WOMEN AS BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS LORD ELMWOOD ASKED MISS MILNER AGAIN--IF SHE TOOK AN AIRING
BUT THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF VIEW SHARED BY DICKENS AND TOLSTOY BY BALZAC AND GEORGE ELIOT FINDS NO PLACE IN MRS INCHBALD'S WORK
TO THE FARM-HOUSE THE PLACE OF MATILDA'S RESIDENCE THERE CAME BESIDES SANDFORD ANOTHER VISITOR FAR LESS WELCOME--VISCOUNT MARGRAVE
TO CALL HER GLOOMY WAS I KNEW TO COMMEND HER BOTH TO HIM AND TO YOU WHO ADMIRE SUCH TEMPERS WHATEVER HER TEMPER IS EVERY ONE ADMIRES IT
BUT NOW MR DORRIFORTH DO NOT FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID FRIGHTEN YOURSELF AND IMAGINE YOUR WARD WORSE THAN SHE REALLY IS--ALL I KNOW OF HER IS MERELY THAT SHE'S YOUNG IDLE INDISCREET AND GIDDY WITH HALF A DOZEN LOVERS IN HER SUITE
YOUR LOOKS TELL ME ITS CONTENTS THEY WILL THEN DISCOVER TO LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED SHE WHAT I FEEL
THIS IS A CONDUCT AGAINST WHICH IT IS MY DUTY TO GUARD YOU AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER DECEIVE EITHER HIM OR YOURSELF
IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW AND SHE FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM AS IF SHE HAD RESOLVED TO DISOBEY HIM
MRS INCHBALD--TO USE THE EXPRESSION OF HER BIOGRAPHER--"WAS ASCERTAINED TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST ORNAMENTS OF HER SEX SHE WAS PAINTED BY LAWRENCE SHE WAS EULOGIZED BY MISS EDGEWORTH SHE WAS COMPLIMENTED BY MADAME DE STAEL HERSELF
MRS INCHBALD HAS TAKEN THIS CHARACTER SHE HAS THROWN IT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A VIOLENT AND ABSORBING PASSION AND UPON THAT THEME SHE HAS WRITTEN HER DELICATE SYMPATHETIC AND ARTIFICIAL BOOK
FOR IT IS WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE THAT I MEET HIM UPON THIS SUBJECT--HE WAS EXTREMELY IMPATIENT AND IMPORTUNATE WHEN HE WAS LAST WITH ME--HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ECCLESIASTICAL SITUATION TO TREAT ME WITH A LEVITY AND ILL BREEDING THAT I COULD ILL HAVE SUFFERED UPON ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAN A COMPLIANCE WITH MY DUTY DICTATE WHAT YOU PLEASE MR DORRIFORTH AND I WILL WRITE IT SAID SHE WITH A WARMTH LIKE THE MOST UNAFFECTED INCLINATION
MY LORD STAID BUT A FEW HOURS YESTERDAY AFTER THE UNHAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE ON WHICH I WRITE TOOK PLACE
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HER CHILD AN ORPHAN TO HAVE FOLLOWED LORD ELMWOOD TO THE TOMB
TO SHIELD HIM FROM DESPONDENCY HE FORMED IN HIS MIND A THOUSAND VISIONS DISPLAYING THE JOYS OF HIS UNION WITH LADY MATILDA
IF I MEAN TO OFFEND YOU MAY I FORFEIT MY LIFE IN ATONEMENT POOR MISS WOODLEY GLAD IN HER SOLITUDE TO SEE ANY ONE FROM ELMWOOD HOUSE FORGOT HIS VISIT WAS AN OFFENCE TILL HE PUT HER IN MIND OF IT
NAY ANSWERED ONE OF THE GUESTS WHO WAS A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHAT DO YOU SAY LADIES--DO YOU THINK MY LORD OUGHT TO GO OUT OF HIS OWN NATION FOR A WIFE AND HE LOOKED AT MISS MILNER FOR THE REPLY
SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND PITY AND HAVING ENDEARED HERSELF TO HIM BY THE MOST AFFECTIONATE WORDS AND CARESSES ON HER BIDDING HIM FAREWELL HE CRIED MOST PITIOUSLY TO GO ALONG WITH HER
IN THIS HOUSE DORRIFORTH HAD LIVED BEFORE THE DEATH OF MR HORTON
ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH HE SENT FOR HIS STEWARD TO HIS STUDY AND AFTER TALKING OF OTHER BUSINESS SAID TO HIM
AFTER THE DEATH OF DR GISBORNE TOO OFTEN VERY UNHAPPY YET MOSTLY CHEERFUL AND ON MY RETURN TO LONDON NEARLY HAPPY
LORD MARGRAVE THOUGH AT SOME DISTANCE FROM HER REMAINED STILL IN HER APARTMENT WHILE HER FEMALE COMPANION HAD STOLEN AWAY
THE RESULT IS THAT WHEN IN MOMENTS OF INSPIRATION SHE RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF HER OPPORTUNITY WHEN MASTERING HER MATERIAL SHE INVESTS HER EXPRESSION WITH THE WHOLE INTENSITY OF HER FEELING AND HER THOUGHT THEN SHE ACHIEVES EFFECTS OF THE RAREST BEAUTY--EFFECTS OF A KIND FOR WHICH ONE MAY SEARCH THROUGH THACKERAY IN VAIN
A WANT OF RECOLLECTION HOWEVER HE BY NO MEANS REGRETTED AS HER WHOLE APPEARANCE CONTRADICTED EVERY SUSPICION HE COULD POSSIBLY ENTERTAIN THAT SHE FAVOURED THE ADDRESSES OF ANY MAN LIVING--AND HAD HE REMEMBERED HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO NAME THE SUBJECT
MISS WOODLEY WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO HEARD THE APPOINTMENT BUT THE ONLY ONE WHO CONCEIVED WITH WHAT SENSATION IT WAS RECEIVED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH GRATIFICATION TO HIS DAUGHTER TO HAVE GONE TO THE TOPMOST WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND HAVE ONLY BEHELD HIS CARRIAGE ENTER THE AVENUE
MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY YOU PROMISED MISS MILNER TO ACCOMPANY HER ONE EVENING TO THE OPERA
LORD ELMWOOD'S CHEERFULNESS HOWEVER ON HIS RETURNING HEALTH AND HIS UNDIMINISHED ATTENTION SOON CONVINCED HIM THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
BUT IF HE DOES NOT ASK FOR ME I WILL NOT--AND PRAY DON'T DECEIVE ME MISS WOODLEY PROMISED HER NOT TO DECEIVE HER
IT WAS A KNOWLEDGE ALSO OF THIS TORPOR IN MISS FENTON'S NATURE FROM WHICH HE FORMED THE PURPOSE OF BREAKING WITH HER
WHICH NO SOONER HAD ESCAPED HIM THAN TO DROWN ITS SOUND HE SAID BRISKLY AND SO YOU TELL ME YOU HAVE HAD GOOD SPORT TO-DAY NO MY LORD I SAID BUT INDIFFERENT TRUE SO YOU DID
LORD ELMWOOD OBSERVED THIS CONDUCT YET HE NEITHER WONDERED OR WAS OFFENDED AT IT--HE HAD PERCEIVED WHAT LITTLE ESTEEM SANDFORD SHOWED HIS NEPHEW FROM HIS FIRST RETURN
THESE WERE ITS CONTENTS
WHILE SHE AROSE ATTENDED BY ONE OF HIS FEMALE SERVANTS FOR WHOM HE HAD SENT TO TOWN TO BRING SUCH CHANGES OF APPAREL AS WERE REQUISITE
AND ALLOWING THAT YOU INSTANTLY WANT JUDGMENT AND I WOULD RATHER WANT JUDGMENT THAN BEAUTY SHE REPLIED AND SO I GIVE UP THE ONE FOR THE OTHER WITH A SERIOUS FACE AS IF PROPOSING A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION DORRIFORTH CONTINUED AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE YOU ARE NOT HANDSOME I SHOULD IF I CONSULTED MY OWN OPINION BELIEVE THAT I WAS NOT
MISS WOODLEY AND MRS HORTON WERE BOTH TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE GOOD DISPOSITION OF HER HEART TO TAKE OFFENCE OR APPEAR TO NOTICE THIS BEHAVIOUR
WITH SENTIMENTS LIKE THESE DORRIFORTH COULD NEVER DISGUISE HIS UNEASINESS AT THE SIGHT OF LORD FREDERICK NOR COULD THE LATTER HELP DISCERNING THE SUSPICION OF THE GUARDIAN AND CONSEQUENTLY EACH WAS EMBARRASSED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER
FOR HE BEGAN A CONVERSATION WITH HIM WHICH THEY VERY SOON RETIRED INTO THE LIBRARY TO TERMINATE
SHE WAS LEAPING FROM HER SEAT IN ECSTASY
EVERYTHING IN PREPARATION FOR THEIR MARRIAGE WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT ELMWOOD HOUSE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS SHE RESOLVED FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE HAD TO REMAIN IN LONDON TO LET NO OCCASION PASS OF TASTING ALL THOSE PLEASURES THAT WERE NOT LIKELY EVER TO RETURN
TO HER QUESTION CONCERNING LORD ELMWOOD SHE ANSWERED IT IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH HE SELDOM SPEAKS--HE APPEARS JUST THE SAME HE EVER DID NOR COULD YOU BY ANY PART OF HIS CONDUCT CONCEIVE THAT ANY SUCH CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE MISS MILNER EXCLAIMED TO HERSELF I AM GLAD HE IS NOT ALTERED--IF HIS WORDS LOOKS OR MANNERS WERE ANY THING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY FORMERLY WERE I SHOULD NOT LIKE HIM SO WELL AND JUST THE REVERSE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE HAD MISS WOODLEY SENT HER WORD HE WAS CHANGED
BUT HAD NOT RELIGION AND SOME OPPOSITE VIRTUES WEIGHED HEAVILY IN THE BALANCE IT WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE DEGENERATED INTO IMPLACABLE STUBBORNNESS
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF UNEXPECTEDLY SEEING LORD FREDERICK HAD TAKEN HIM OFF HIS GUARD AND BEING TOTALLY UNPREPARED HE COULD NOT CONCEAL INDICATIONS OF THE SURPRISE AND OF THE SHOCK IT HAD GIVEN HIM
VERY WELL IF YOU PRESENT ME WITH YOURSELF IT IS ALL THAT I ASK SANDFORD MOVED UPON HIS CHAIR AS IF HE SAT UNEASY
MATILDA COULD NOT BUT FEEL A REGARD FOR HER FATHER'S HEIR IN RETURN FOR THAT WHICH HE HAD SO FERVENTLY DECLARED FOR HER
GOOD FORTUNE
IT WAS UNTHINKINGLY REPEATED EDWARDS
AND IT IS MY RESOLUTION THAT YOU SHALL PART IF YOU WILL NOT CONTRIVE THE MEANS THAT DUTY FALLS ON ME AND WITHOUT ANY INVENTION I SEE THE MEASURE AT ONCE WHAT IS IT CRIED MISS MILNER EAGERLY
FOR AFTER ALL THAT I HAVE DONE FOR MY NEPHEW IT WOULD BE A PITY TO FORSAKE HIM AT LAST
THE ABSOLUTE ORDERS HE RECEIVED FROM THE STEWARD ON HIS FIRST RETURN FROM HIS TRAVELS WERE NEVER TO MENTION HIS DAUGHTER ANY MORE THAN HIS LATE WIFE BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD THE FAULT OF HAVING RUDELY INTRUDED INTO LADY MATILDA'S PRESENCE RUSHED ALSO UPON HIS MIND
WITH AN ANXIOUS DESIRE THAT THE AFFECTION OR ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN LORD FREDERICK AND MISS MILNER MIGHT BE FINALLY DISSOLVED HER GUARDIAN RECEIVED WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION OVERTURES OF MARRIAGE FROM SIR EDWARD ASHTON
MISS WOODLEY I HAVE BEEN COUNTERFEITING INDIFFERENCE TO HIM_--I NOW FIND THAT ALL HIS INDIFFERENCE TO ME HAS BEEN COUNTERFEIT AND THAT WE NOT ONLY LOVE BUT LOVE EQUALLY SUPPOSE THIS ALL AS YOU HOPE--I YET THINK IT HIGHLY NECESSARY THAT YOUR GUARDIAN SHOULD BE INFORMED SERIOUSLY INFORMED IT WAS MERE ACCIDENT FOR AT PRESENT THAT PLEA SEEMS BUT AS A SUBTERFUGE WHICH BROUGHT LORD FREDERICK HITHER NO THAT WILL BE DESTROYING THE WORK SO SUCCESSFULLY BEGUN
COME SAID HE TO HIM AS SOON AS THE DINNER WAS REMOVED LAY ASIDE YOUR BOOK AND BE GOOD COMPANY SANDFORD LIFTED UP HIS EYES UPON HIM--STARED IN HIS FACE--AND CAST THEM ON THE BOOK AGAIN
DO YOU SUPPOSE MY DEAR WE TURNED YOUR SITUATION INTO RIDICULE NO SIR,--BUT THERE IS A SORT OF HUMILIATION IN THE GRIEF TO WHICH I AM DOOMED THAT OUGHT SURELY TO BE TREATED WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF DELICACY BY MY FRIENDS I DON'T KNOW ON WHAT POINT YOU FIX REAL DELICACY
INFORMED OF THE CAUSE OF HER INDISPOSITION HE FOLLOWED MISS WOODLEY WITH A TENDER ANXIETY FOR HER HEALTH AND WITH GRIEF AND CONFUSION THAT HE HAD SO CARELESSLY ENDANGERED IT
SHE EASILY DISCERNED TOO THROUGH ALL THAT POLITENESS WHICH HE ASSUMED--THAT HE WAS NO LONGER THE CONSIDERATE THE FORBEARING CHARACTER HE FORMERLY WAS
HE APPEARED ASHAMED TOO THAT HE HAD BEEN SO FAR PREVAILED UPON AND SAID BY WAY OF EXCUSE FOR MR MILNER'S SAKE I WOULD DO MUCH--NAY ANY THING BUT THAT TO WHICH I HAVE JUST NOW SWORN NEVER TO CONSENT
SANDFORD WAS ANGRY AT THIS LITTLE COMPLIMENT AND CRIED I SHOULD THINK THE SERPENT'S SKIN WOULD BE MUCH MORE CHARACTERISTIC MY LORD CRIED SHE DOES NOT MR SANDFORD USE ME ILL VEXT WITH OTHER THINGS SHE FELT HERSELF EXTREMELY HURT AT THIS AND MADE THE APPEAL ALMOST IN TEARS
BUT HE WAS OUT I SUPPOSE--FOR THEY DID NOT EXPECT YOU AT ELMWOOD HOUSE NO THEY DID NOT IN SUCH CONVERSATION RUSHBROOK AND HIS UNCLE CONTINUED TO THE END OF THEIR JOURNEY
DORRIFORTH RETURNED TO LONDON HEAVILY AFFLICTED FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FRIEND
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEVERITY HE NOW ASSUMED HIS WARD IN THE PROSPECT OF PARTING FROM HIM GREW MELANCHOLY
AND AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED SHE PUT HER FINGERS SULLENLY TO HER LIPS NOR TOUCHED HER KNIFE AND FORK NOR SPOKE A WORD IN REPLY TO ANY THING THAT WAS SAID TO HER DURING THE WHOLE DINNER
BUT AS SHE WOULD NOT OWN THAT SHE DID SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE TO SAY
HOW SHOULD SHE CRIED SANDFORD WHERE EVERY ONE HIDES HIS FACE TILL FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN CONVERSATION SUCH AS THIS THE HOURS PASSED AWAY
BUT I BELIEVE HE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR ENOUGH FOR THAT YOU HAD BETTER DRESS AT THE HOUSE OF THE LADIES WITH WHOM YOU GO SAID MISS WOODLEY
HE SAID BESIDES MANY THINGS OF THE SAME KIND AND ALL WITH THE UTMOST CIVILITY YET NOT WITH THAT WARMTH WITH WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN IN THE MORNING--INTO THAT HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED--HIS COOLNESS WAS THE EFFECT OF REFLECTION
RUSHBROOK HAD NOW GAINED THE POINT OF REMAINING IN THE ROOM
AND OF THE DOOR LEADING TO THE GALLERY THEY HAD A KEY TO IMPEDE ANY ONE FROM PASSING THAT WAY WITHOUT FIRST RINGING A BELL
BUT SURE OF A SECOND DENIAL HE FOLLOWED THE SERVANT WHO TOOK THE LAST MESSAGE AND AS MISS WOODLEY CAME OUT OF HER APARTMENT INTO THE GALLERY TO SPEAK TO HIM RUSHBROOK PRESENTED HIMSELF AND TOLD THE MAN TO RETIRE
AT WHICH MISS MILNER WAS CAPABLE OF SITTING UP--HE WAS WITH HER HOWEVER BUT A VERY SHORT TIME SOME NECESSARY CONCERNS RELATIVE TO HIS LATE KINSMAN'S AFFAIRS CALLING HIM IN HASTE TO LONDON
SOME BOLDLY ADVISED APPLICATION TO THE FATHER IN DEFIANCE TO THE OLD PRIEST
YET INTIMIDATED BY HIS RESPECT AND TENDERNESS FOR LADY MATILDA RATHER THAN BY FEAR OF THE REBUFFS OF HIS COMPANION HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO NAME HER TILL THE RIDE WAS JUST FINISHED AND THEY CAME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF THE HOUSE--INCITED THEN BY THE APPREHENSION HE MIGHT NOT SOON AGAIN ENJOY SO FIT AN OPPORTUNITY HE SAID PARDON ME MR SANDFORD IF I GUESS WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN AND IF MY CURIOSITY FORCES ME TO INQUIRE FOR MISS WOODLEY'S AND LADY MATILDA'S HEALTH HE NAMED MISS WOODLEY FIRST TO PROLONG THE TIME BEFORE HE MENTIONED MATILDA
VERY MUCH RETURNED SHE
BUT WHERE THE MISERY OF HER DAUGHTER PRESENTS ITSELF THE EXPIRING PENITENT WOULD THERE COMBAT THE WILL OF HEAVEN
HER FEARS GIVING BIRTH TO DREAMS TERRIFYING AS HER WAKING THOUGHTS
BUT IF WHETHER BY DESIGN OR BY ACCIDENT I EVER SEE OR HEAR FROM HER THAT MOMENT MY COMPLIANCE TO HER MOTHER'S SUPPLICATION CEASES AND I ABANDON HER ONCE MORE SANDFORD SIGHED
NOR EVER ENQUIRED WHAT MIGHT BE HER OTHER FAILINGS
RUSHBROOK CAST HIS EYES UPON HER AND STOOD MOTIONLESS--HIS LIPS ONLY MOVED
AT FIRST SO SOUND HER SLEEP HAD BEEN THAT SHE HAD A DIFFICULTY IN CALLING TO MIND WHY SHE WAS UNHAPPY
BUT HE FORGAVE IN SANDFORD'S HUMOUR A THOUSAND FAULTS HE WOULD NOT FORGIVE IN ANY OTHER
IT WAS PERSUASIVE IT WAS PERFECT ELOQUENCE
AND WITH A BOSOM TORN BY MORE EXCRUCIATING SENSATIONS THAN THOSE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN TO HIS ADVERSARY
HE THEN HEAVED A SIGH OF CONTENT THAT ALL HAD THUS ENDED
AND THE FIRST TIME THE WORD DORRIFORTH WAS SPOKEN WAS BY A SERVANT WHO WITH ALACRITY OPENED THE DRESSING ROOM DOOR WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY RAPPING AND CRIED MADAM MR DORRIFORTH DORRIFORTH IMMEDIATELY CAME IN AND WENT EAGERLY TO MISS MILNER
THERE WAS YET THAT WHICH ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION BEYOND ANY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO HIMSELF--THE FEATURES OF LORD ELMWOOD--OF WHICH HIS DAUGHTER'S WHOM HE HAD JUST BEHELD HAD THE MOST STRIKING RESEMBLANCE
HIS HEART HAD TAKEN THE MOST DECIDED PART AGAINST HER AND HIS FACE HAD ASSUMED THE MOST SEVERE ASPECT OF REPROACH
AND AFTER SITTING SEVERAL MINUTES AND TALKING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS TO WHICH HIS WARD REPLIED WITH A DEJECTION IN HER VOICE AND MANNER--HE SAID PERHAPS I AM WRONG MISS MILNER BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT YOU ARE LATELY MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL SHE BLUSHED AS SHE ALWAYS DID WHEN THE SUBJECT WAS HERSELF
AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE OFFICIOUS PERSON WHO FORCES EVEN HIS GOOD ADVICE IS NOT AS BLAMEABLE AS THE OBSTINATE ONE WHO WILL NOT LISTEN TO IT
COME MY DEAR MISS MILNER AND FIND IN YOUR ONCE RIGID MONITOR A FAITHFUL CONFIDANTE
AND SEEING HER IN THE SAME DRESS THAT SHE HAD WORN ALL THE DAY TURNED THEM HASTILY AWAY FROM HER AGAIN--NOT WITH A LOOK OF TRIUMPH BUT OF CONFUSION
GO ON SAID MISS MILNER TO THE FOOTMAN DESIRE THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON NO CRIED LORD FREDERICK NOT TILL YOU HAVE TOLD ME WHEN I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN I WILL WRITE YOU WORD MY LORD REPLIED SHE SOMETHING ALARMED
THERE ARE BUT FEW PERSONS WHO EVER FELT THE REAL PASSION OF JEALOUSY BECAUSE FEW HAVE FELT THE REAL PASSION OF LOVE
DORRIFORTH WAS HOLDING HIM FONDLY ROUND THE WAIST AS HE STOOD WITH HIS FEET UPON HIS KNEES
AND IT WILL NOT ONLY BE MY STUDY TO FORM SUCH A SOCIETY AS YOU MAY APPROVE BUT I AM CERTAIN IT WILL BE LIKEWISE THE STUDY OF LADY ELMWOOD HE WAS GOING ON BUT AS IF A PONIARD HAD THRUST HER TO THE HEART SHE WRITHED UNDER THIS UNEXPECTED STROKE
LORD ELMWOOD
TICKETS WERE PRESENTED TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AND FASHION
THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER WAS NOW ARRIVED
AND MISS MILNER FOUND INFINITE GRATIFICATION IN BEING TOLD THAT HER'S WAS A CRUEL CASE AND THAT IT WAS UNJUST AND BARBAROUS TO FORCE SO MUCH BEAUTY INTO CONCEALMENT WHILE LONDON WAS FILLED WITH HER ADMIRERS
BUT ONE I LOOK SO WELL IN THAT YOU WILL HARDLY KNOW ME WHEN I HAVE IT ON YOU ARE SERIOUSLY THEN RESOLVED TO GO SAID MISS WOODLEY IF YOU HEAR NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT FROM YOUR GUARDIAN WHETHER I DO HEAR OR NOT MISS WOODLEY I AM EQUALLY RESOLVED TO GO BUT YOU KNOW MY DEAR HE HAS DESIRED YOU NOT--AND YOU USED ALWAYS TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS AS MY GUARDIAN I CERTAINLY DID OBEY HIM
THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE THAT MOMENT ENDED
BEFORE THE MORNING WAS OVER SHE EXPERIENCED THE EXTREME JOY OF SITTING BY HER FATHER'S SIDE AS THEY DROVE TO TOWN AND OF RECEIVING DURING HIS CONVERSATION A THOUSAND PROOFS OF HIS LOVE AND TOKENS OF HER LASTING HAPPINESS
THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE MISTAKE AND ARE HUMBLED--BUT I ENTREAT YOU TO SPARE THEIR FARTHER TRIAL AND FOR A SINGLE WEEK DO NOT INSULT ME WITH THE OPEN PREFERENCE OF ANOTHER
BUT INSTEAD OF PICTURING EVERY OCCASION OF HER FALL TO COME BRIEFLY TO THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOWED
AND WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY MR DORRIFORTH CONVEYED HER TO HER OWN CHAMBER WITHOUT TAKING HER IN HIS ARMS
HIS INSENSIBILITY TO HER LAMENTATIONS--THE AGITATED LOOKS HE SOMETIMES CAST UPON HER--HER WEAK AND DEFENCELESS STATE ALL CONSPIRED TO FILL HER MIND WITH HORROR
DURING THEIR CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT NOT BY WAY OF CONSOLATION TO HER BUT AS A REPROACH TO LORD ELMWOOD HE ONE DAY ANGRILY EXCLAIMED AND YET NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS PROVOCATION HE HAS NOT COME TO THE DETERMINATION THAT HE WILL THINK NO MORE OF HER--HE LINGERS AND HE HESITATES--I NEVER SAW HIM SO WEAK UPON ANY OCCASION BEFORE THIS WAS JOYFUL HEARING TO MISS WOODLEY
HER EYES FOR A MOMENT BEAMING WITH HOPE AND JOY
WHEN MISS MILNER ARRIVED AT BATH SHE THOUGHT IT THE MOST ALTERED PLACE SHE HAD EVER SEEN--SHE WAS MISTAKEN--IT WAS HERSELF THAT WAS CHANGED
DO YOU EXPECT LORD FREDERICK IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I DO ONE MORE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK MADAM AND TO WHICH I EXPECT A REPLY EQUALLY UNRESERVED
DEAR DEAR SAINT FORGIVE ME
SHE HAD BEEN EDUCATED AT AN ENGLISH BOARDING SCHOOL AND HAD NO IDEA OF THE SUPERIOR AND SUBORDINATE STATE OF CHARACTERS IN A FOREIGN SEMINARY--BESIDES AS A WOMAN SHE WAS PRIVILEGED TO SAY ANY THING SHE PLEASED
YET UPON THE EVE OF THE DAY ON WHICH HIS PATRON WAS TO ARRIVE HE WAS EVIDENTLY CAST DOWN
NOW MR SANDFORD CONTINUED SHE THOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD YOU SPEAK IN HIS FAVOUR AND I ONCE THOUGHT AS INDIFFERENTLY OF MR RUSHBROOK AS YOU CAN DO YET NOW I WILL VENTURE TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU DO NOT THINK HE WISHES LADY MATILDA MUCH HAPPIER THAN SHE IS I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY SO ANSWERED SANDFORD
WHAT IS IT HARRY OH
EVERY VIRTUE WHICH IT WAS HIS VOCATION TO PREACH IT WAS HIS CARE TO PRACTISE
AND EVEN NOW RESUMED MISS MILNER HAVE I NOT CONCEALED IT FROM ALL BUT YOU BY PLUNGING MYSELF INTO A NEW DIFFICULTY FROM WHICH I KNOW NOT HOW I SHALL BE EXTRICATED
AND THIS WAS AGREED UPON
DO YOU FORGET YOUNG MAN HOW SHORT A TIME IT IS SINCE YOU WERE ENTREATED FOR I PROVE THAT I DO NOT WHILE THIS ANXIETY FOR LADY MATILDA ARISES FROM WHAT I FEEL ON THAT ACCOUNT REMOVE YOUR ANXIETY THEN FROM HER TO YOURSELF
THE LADIES AS WELL AS SANDFORD KNEW HIM WELL AND THEY ALL ALMOST AT ONCE ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR HIS LOOKS TOLD THEM SOMETHING DISTRESSFUL HAD BEFALLEN HIM
BUT IN HIS HEART RESOLVED NEVER TO FORGET THE RIDICULOUS AFFRIGHT INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN THROWN
THE RECORD WITH ALL ITS QUAINTNESS PRODUCES A CURIOUS IMPRESSION OF STOICISM--OF A CERTAIN GRIM ACCEPTANCE OF THE FACTS OF LIFE
YOU MISS MILNER I SHOULD SUPPOSE MUST BE A VERY BAD JUDGE OF WHAT IS PLAIN AND WHAT IS NOT HOW SO BECAUSE I AM SURE YOU WILL READILY OWN YOU DO NOT THINK YOURSELF HANDSOME
HE MARRIED LADY ELMWOOD CONTRARY TO HIS DETERMINATION BECAUSE HE LOVED
TO FIND THAT MANY WHO BUT A FEW YEARS BEFORE WERE LEFT IN THEIR BLOOM OF YOUTH AND HEALTH ARE DEAD--TO FIND THAT CHILDREN LEFT AT SCHOOL ARE MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN--THAT SOME WHO WERE LEFT IN RICHES ARE REDUCED TO POVERTY--THAT OTHERS WHO WERE IN POVERTY ARE BECOME RICH--TO FIND THOSE ONCE RENOWNED FOR VIRTUE NOW DETESTED FOR VICE--ROVING HUSBANDS GROWN CONSTANT--CONSTANT HUSBANDS BECOME ROVERS--THE FIRMEST FRIENDS CHANGED TO THE MOST IMPLACABLE ENEMIES--BEAUTY FADED
THE EVENT PROVED HE HAD
BUT ONE OF LORD ELMWOOD'S VALETS WENT UP TO HER AND ANSWERED MADAM MY LORD DESIRES TO SEE YOU BEFORE YOU RETIRE YOUR LORD SHE CRIED IS HE NOT OUT OF TOWN NO MADAM MY LORD HAS BEEN AT HOME EVER SINCE YOU WENT OUT
BUT THE IMPATIENCE TO OBEY IT WAS IN RUSHBROOK SO VIOLENT IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIMSELF AND EXTREMELY TROUBLESOME TO SANDFORD
IT SO HAPPENED AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE IT DID THAT A LAWSUIT CONCERNING SOME POSSESSIONS IN THE WEST INDIES AND OTHER INTRICATE AFFAIRS THAT CAME WITH HIS TITLE AND ESTATE FREQUENTLY KEPT LORD ELMWOOD FROM HIS HOUSE PART OF THE DAY
I GO MISS WOODLEY HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU IMAGINE I WOULD PLAY THE BUFFOON AT A MASQUERADE MISS MILNER'S FACE CHANGED INTO ITS FORMER STATE
A SERVANT CAME--HE ASKED TO SPEAK WITH MISS WOODLEY IF SHE WAS QUITE ALONE HE WAS SHOWN INTO AN APARTMENT AND MISS WOODLEY ENTERED TO HIM
AND WHEN IT IS FOR THE GENERAL GOOD OF RELIGION HIS HOLINESS THINKS IT INCUMBENT ON HIM TO PUBLISH HIS BULL AND REMIT ALL PENALTIES FOR THEIR NON-OBSERVANCE
TIMES ARE CHANGED MR RUSHBROOK SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE--YOU WERE THEN BUT A CHILD YET I LOVE ALL THOSE PERSONS NOW THAT I LOVED THEN REPLIED HE
AS THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE AVENUE TO THE CARRIAGE THAT BROUGHT THEM MATILDA FELT AN AWFUL AND YET GLADSOME SENSATION WHICH NO TERMS CAN DESCRIBE
I LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE PASSION OF A MISTRESS AND WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS OF A WIFE MISS WOODLEY AT THIS SENTENCE SAT DOWN--IT WAS ON A CHAIR THAT WAS CLOSE TO HER--HER FEET COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN HER TO ANY OTHER
AND WHEN I TAKE EVERY THING INTO CONSIDERATION MISS MILNER ADDED HE I REJOICE THAT YOUR SENTIMENTS HAPPEN TO BE SUCH AS YOU HAVE OWNED
I HAVE TAKEN SUCH A RESOLUTION ANSWERED HE YET I BEAR HIM NO ENMITY AS THIS SHORT REPLY INDICATED THAT HE MEANT TO SAY NO MORE NO MORE WAS ASKED
AND THAT HE WAS WILLING TO CONSENT TO HIS WARD'S MARRIAGE WITH HIS NEPHEW IF SHE WOULD CONCUR
MISS MILNER WAS CONFUSED AND MISS WOODLEY IN TORTURE AT THIS PALPABLE AFFRONT TO WHICH DORRIFORTH ALONE APPEARED INDIFFERENT
AND SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU SAID LADY EVANS
AND SHE BECAME A NATIVE BEAUTY WITH THE ARTLESS ARGUMENTS OF REASON ONLY FOR HER AID
THEY WERE MORE LIKE INTIMATIONS THAN SOLEMN DECLARATIONS--FOR THOUGH HE HAD SAID HE WOULD NEVER REPROACH HER FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT SHE MIGHT EXPECT THEY SHOULD PART HE HAD NOT POSITIVELY SAID THEY SHOULD
NOT ANY EVENT THROUGHOUT LIFE CAN ARREST THE REFLECTION OF A THOUGHTFUL MIND MORE POWERFULLY OR LEAVE SO LASTING AN IMPRESSION AS THAT OF RETURNING TO A PLACE AFTER A FEW YEARS ABSENCE AND OBSERVING AN ENTIRE ALTERATION IN RESPECT TO ALL THE PERSONS WHO ONCE FORMED THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
BUT THE FRIEND AND COMFORTER OF THE FORLORN AND MISERABLE
AS THEY WERE ARRANGING THEMSELVES AT THE SUPPER-TABLE DO MISS MILNER SAID MRS HORTON HAVE SOMETHING WARM FOR YOUR SUPPER
YET ONE UNLUCKY MOMENT CANDIDLY THOUGH UNWITTINGLY DIVULGED IT--I FRANKLY OWNED THAT FORTUNE HAVING CHASED AWAY NECESSITY THERE REMAINED NO OTHER INCITEMENT TO STIMULATE ME TO A LABOUR I ABHORRED IT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE POWER OF THE PERSON TO WHOM I CONFIDED THIS SECRET TO SEND NECESSITY ONCE MORE
HER OWN AND HER GUARDIAN'S ACQUAINTANCE AND ADDED TO THEM THE NEW FRIENDSHIPS TO USE THE UNMEANING LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD WHICH SHE WAS CONTINUALLY FORMING CROWDED SO PERPETUALLY TO THE HOUSE THAT SELDOM HAD DORRIFORTH EVEN A MOMENT LEFT HIM FROM HER VISITS OR VISITORS TO WARN HER OF HER DANGER:--YET WHEN A MOMENT OFFERED HE CAUGHT IT EAGERLY--PRESSED THE NECESSITY OF TIME NOT ALWAYS PASSED IN SOCIETY
SHE SAT FOR A MINUTE REFLECTING HOW TO ROUSE HIM FROM THIS COMPOSURE--SHE FIRST THOUGHT OF ATTACKING HIM WITH UPBRAIDINGS
AND EVEN YOUR MOST RESPECTED FATHER COULD HE BEHOLD THE RESIGNATION WOULD CONCUR IN ITS PROPRIETY
LORD ELMWOOD WAS BY NATURE AND MORE FROM EDUCATION OF A SERIOUS THINKING AND PHILOSOPHIC TURN OF MIND
THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS OF MRS INCHBALD'S LIFE WERE PASSED AMID THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STAGE
OR IF THE DELIRIUM GAVE HER A MOMENT'S RECOMPENCE WHAT WERE HER SUFFERINGS HER REMORSE WHEN SHE WAS AWAKENED FROM THE FLEETING JOY BY THE ARRIVAL OF HER HUSBAND
BUT ALAS
BUT ALAS
TWO MONTHS PREVIOUS TO LADY ELMWOOD'S DEATH MISS WOODLEY AND LADY MATILDA WERE TAKING THEIR USUAL WALK IN SOME FIELDS AND LANES NEAR TO THEIR HOUSE WHEN CHANCE THREW LORD MARGRAVE IN THEIR WAY DURING A THUNDER STORM IN WHICH THEY WERE SUDDENLY CAUGHT
IT IS ALWAYS PROPER ANSWERED SANDFORD FOR YOU TO THINK OF HIM THOUGH HE SHOULD NEVER THINK ON YOU SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SAID THAT SHE DID THINK OF HIM BUT SHE FELT AN APPREHENSION OF MENTIONING HIS NAME"--AND SHE WEPT BITTERLY WHILE SHE SPOKE
IT WILL DO HER NO GOOD--BESIDES ADDED HE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER LORD ELMWOOD DOES NOT EXPECT SECRECY ON MY PART
YOU KNOW WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST
SHE SIGHED WITH A KIND OF TREMBLING ECSTASY
THIS INTELLIGENCE HAVING DISPERSED MISS MILNER'S FEARS SHE CONCLUDED UPON DRESSING AT HOME
SOMETIMES THE WHOLE EVENING
ONE OF THE SERVANTS WENT TO THE WINDOW AND ANSWERED MY LORD AND MR SANDFORD MADAM COME BACK TO DINNER AS I LIVE CRIED MRS HORTON
AND WHEREVER I HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE TO YOUR WISHES ATTRIBUTE MY DEMERITS TO SOME INFIRMITY OF MIND RATHER THAN TO A NEGLIGENCE OF YOUR HAPPINESS
DISPENSING AT THE SAME TIME WITH MY EVER SEEING HER AND YOU WILL COMPLY I WILL TILL SHE ENCROACHES ON THIS CONCESSION AND DARES TO HOPE FOR A GREATER
AT HOME I SHALL SEE LORD ELMWOOD AND THAT WILL BE HAPPINESS
AND THOUGH HE DID NOT SAY SO HE WAS AND LOOKED HIGHLY OFFENDED
AND THUS WITH ALL HIS GOOD SENSE WANTED THE SENSE TO FOLLOW THE RULE BELIEVE WHAT YOUR ENEMIES SAY OF YOU RATHER THAN WHAT IS SAID BY YOUR FRIENDS THIS RULE ATTENDED TO WOULD MAKE A THOUSAND PEOPLE AMIABLE WHO ARE NOW THE REVERSE
OF READING
ON THEIR PART THEY REGARDED HIM WITH ALL THAT RESPECT AND REVERENCE WHICH THE MOST RELIGIOUS FLOCK SHEWS TO ITS PASTOR
SHE SAW THE IMPENDING FROWN AND RUSHING TOWARDS HIM TOOK HIS HAND FEARFULLY AND KNELT AT HIS FEET
BUT PERHAPS IN THIS IMPLICIT SUBMISSION TO HIM THERE WAS A DISTANT HOPE THAT THE NECESSITOUS SITUATION OF HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT PLEAD MORE FORCIBLY THAN HIS PARENTAL LOVE
AND WHILE YOU INSULT LORD AND LADY ELMWOOD'S DAUGHTER BY AN INTRUSION LIKE THIS AND THEN RIDICULE HER ABJECT STATE BY MOCKERIES LIKE THESE HE ROSE FROM HIS KNEES INSTANTLY AND INTERRUPTED HER CRYING WHAT CAN I DO
MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD AS TO PROPOSE THAT SHE SHOULD GO WITH HER AND AID HER WITH A WORD OR TWO OCCASIONALLY IN HER EXCUSE
I REMIT THE TIE OF BEING HER PARENT
AND NOT WAITING TO PUT IT ON WENT NIMBLY DOWN THE GREAT STAIRCASE WITH IT HANGING ON HER ARM
TO ME THERE IS SOMETHING VERY EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT HER CONTINUED MRS HORTON FINDING SHE HAD CAUGHT HIS LORDSHIP'S ATTENTION
SALUTED HER AN HONOUR HE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE CONFERRED BEFORE WITH SIGNS OF THE SINCEREST FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION
MISS MILNER DINES AT HOME I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED WHERE I SHALL DINE REPLIED HE TAKING NO NOTICE OF THE CONCLUSION OF HER SPEECH
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT SAID SHE
MRS INCHBALD'S WORLD HAS PASSED AWAY FROM US FOR EVER
BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS IN HIS HAND HE SEEMED DISTRESSED TO KNOW WHAT HE SHOULD DO WITH IT--IN WHAT PLACE TO GO AND READ IT--OR HOW TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST ITS CONTENTS
BUT SAID THAT HE HAD NO FARTHER AUTHORITY FOR THE SUPPOSITION THAN WHAT HIS OBSERVATION HAD GIVEN HIM FOR THAT EVERY EXPLANATION BOTH UPON HIS AND HER SIDE HAD BEEN EVADED
IF NOT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SUPPOSE THAT I WILL DO SO NOW HE WAS GOING TO REPLY WHEN MR SANDFORD SULLENLY INTERRUPTED HIM AND MAKING TOWARDS THE DOOR CRIED WHEN YOU COME TO THE POINT FOR WHICH YOU BROUGHT ME HERE SEND FOR ME AGAIN STAY NOW SAID DORRIFORTH
HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT BUT WENT ON
WHILE NONE BUT MISS WOODLEY KNEW OR HAD THE MOST DISTANT SUSPICION OF THE REAL CAUSE
THEY NEITHER OF THEM REPLIED OR CHANGED THEIR SITUATION
MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD GIVEN SO MANY TEARS TO HER SORROWS BUT NEVER TILL NOW ONE TO HER ANGER HAD A DEEPER SENSE OF THIS INDIFFERENCE THAN OF THE ANGER ITSELF AND TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE SUFFERED LEFT THE ROOM
I BELIEVE IT WOULD COST YOU EVEN YOUR OWN HAPPINESS THAT IS A PRICE I HAVE NOT NOW TO GIVE REPLIED SANDFORD AND BEGAN READING AGAIN
WHOEVER MY LORD ELMWOOD MARRIES SIR SAID MISS WOODLEY HE NO DOUBT WILL BE HAPPY BUT WHAT SAY YOU MADAM ASKED THE VISITOR STILL KEEPING HIS EYES ON MISS MILNER
BUT HEAVEN IS WITNESS TO ALL MY STRUGGLES--NOR WOULD I EVEN TO MYSELF ACKNOWLEDGE THE SHAMELESS PREPOSSESSION TILL FORCED BY A SENSE OF HIS DANGER SILENCE CRIED MISS WOODLEY STRUCK WITH HORROR
TO SEE HER GUARDIAN AT HER FEET STRUCK HER WITH A SENSE OF IMPROPRIETY AS IF SHE HAD SEEN A PARENT THERE
MR SANDFORD PERFECTLY KNEW HOW TO INFLUENCE THE SENTIMENTS AND SENSATIONS OF ALL HUMAN KIND BUT YET HE HAD THE FORBEARANCE NOT TO DRAW ALL HEARTS TOWARDS HIM THERE WERE SOME WHOSE HATRED HE THOUGHT NOT UNWORTHY OF HIS PIOUS LABOURS
AT LENGTH FIXING HER LOOKS UPON HER DAUGHTER AS THEIR LAST DEAR OBJECT SHE WAS JUST UNDERSTOOD TO UTTER THE WORD FATHER I UNDERSTAND YOU REPLIED SANDFORD AND BY ALL THAT INFLUENCE I EVER HAD OVER HIM BY MY PRAYERS MY TEARS AND THEY FLOWED AS HE SPOKE I WILL IMPLORE HIM TO OWN HIS CHILD SHE COULD NOW ONLY SMILE IN THANKS
AND RUSHBROOK BY HIS ENTREATIES NOW GAINED THE INTELLIGENCE WHO THE NOBLEMAN WAS WHO ADDRESSED MATILDA AND ON WHAT VIEWS
BUT NOT TO SEE HIM AT ALL--FOR THAT SHE WAS NOT PREPARED
TO AVOID HER WAS HER FIRST CAUTION AND SHE TOOK THE ONLY METHOD
SANDFORD OBSERVED WITH GRIEF THIS FIRMNESS
CURIOSITY AT LENGTH GOT THE BETTER OF HER FEARS--SHE OPENED THE LETTER AND SCARCE ABLE TO HOLD IT WHILE SHE READ SHE READ THE FOLLOWING WORDS MADAM WHILE I CONSIDERED YOU ONLY AS MY WARD MY FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU WAS UNBOUNDED--WHEN I LOOKED UPON YOU AS A WOMAN FORMED TO GRACE A FASHIONABLE CIRCLE MY ADMIRATION EQUALLED MY FRIENDSHIP--AND WHEN FATE PERMITTED ME TO BEHOLD YOU IN THE TENDER LIGHT OF MY BETROTHED WIFE MY SOARING LOVE LEFT THOSE HUMBLER PASSIONS AT A DISTANCE
AND SHE IN HER TURN WAS AFRAID BY THE TOO SUDDEN MENTION OF HIS NAME TO DISCOMPOSE HER
I AM THE HAPPIEST OF WOMEN IN THE AFFECTION HE HAS PROVED TO ME BUT I WONDER WHETHER IT WOULD EXIST UNDER ILL TREATMENT
I AM GLAD HER REQUEST STOPPED WHERE IT DID
AT THIRTY-FIVE HER COURSE WAS RUN"--A COURSE FULL OF PERILS OF HOPES OF FEARS OF JOYS AND AT THE END OF SORROWS
FOR HE DREADED THAT LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE THEIR NATURAL ANTIPATHY MIGHT BE INCREASED EVEN TO AVERSION
SHE HESITATED A SINGLE INSTANT WHETHER SHE SHOULD OR NOT--THEN WENT A FEW STEPS FURTHER TILL SHE CAME TO THE SECOND LANDING PLACE
RUSHBROOK WITH HIS FEARS ALL VERIFIED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS UNCLE HAD LEFT HIM SAT WITH HIS HEAD RECLINED AGAINST A BOOKCASE AND EVERY LIMB EXTENDED WITH THE DESPAIR THAT HAD SEIZED HIM
AND BY SLEEPING THE TIME WILL PASS AWAY UNPERCEIVED IF I COULD SLEEP MADAM WILL YOU PLAY A GAME OF CARDS MY LORD SAID SANDFORD FOR I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU TILL SHE COMES HOME
AND AT LAST OF LAUGHING AT HIM
WHAT IS ALL THIS CRIED SANDFORD GOING UP TO THEM IN ANGER
THEY LONGED TO SEE IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO LOOK THEM IN THE FACE
AND AS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD SHE BELIEVED INDUCE HER TO RETIRE INTO A CONVENT SHE THOUGHT IT A HAPPY RATHER THAN AN UNHAPPY EVENT
DURING HIS ABSENCE THAT DAY LORD ELMWOOD HAD CALLED SANDFORD APART AND SAID TO HIM,--THAT AS THE MALEVOLENCE WHICH HE ONCE OBSERVED BETWEEN HIM AND RUSHBROOK HAD HE PERCEIVED SUBSIDED HE ADVISED HIM IF HE WAS A WELL-WISHER TO THE YOUNG MAN TO SOUND HIS HEART AND COUNSEL HIM NOT TO ACT AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS NEAREST RELATION AND FRIEND
WHY SORRY
SHALL I GO TO LORD FREDERICK AND HUMBLING MYSELF BEFORE HIM BEG HIS FORGIVENESS
SANDFORD NEVER CAME INTO HER THOUGHTS WHILE THE IMAGE OF LORD ELMWOOD NEVER LEFT THEM
YES TO MY SHAME I LOVE HIM CRIED SHE ALL EMOTION I MEANT TO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE WEAKNESS BECAUSE I SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE DISPLEASING TO YOU--BUT APPREHENSION FOR HIS SAFETY HAS TAKEN AWAY EVERY POWER OF RESTRAINT AND I BESEECH YOU TO SPARE HIS LIFE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT CRIED SANDFORD WITH AN AIR OF TRIUMPH
AYE ELMWOOD CRIED ANOTHER GENTLEMAN AT TABLE YOU'LL BRING HOME I AM AFRAID A FOREIGN WIFE AND THAT I SHAN'T FORGIVE IT IS HIS ERRAND ABROAD I MAKE NO DOUBT SAID ANOTHER VISITOR
HE HAD MADE UNUSUAL PROGRESS IN HIS STUDIES HAD COMPLETED THE TOUR OF ITALY AND GERMANY AND RETURNED HOME WITH THE AIR AND ADDRESS OF A PERFECT MAN OF FASHION--THERE WAS BESIDES AN ELEGANCE AND PERSUASION IN HIS MANNER ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE
THREE
SHE IS NOT HAPPY HE CONSIDERED WITHIN HIMSELF EVERY WORD AND ACTION DECLARES SHE IS NOT
AND ALL SEVERE ADMONITION BEING AT THIS TIME UNNECESSARY EITHER TO EXHORT HER TO HER DUTY OR TO WARN HER AGAINST HER FOLLY SHE WAS EVEN IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR WITH MISS FENTON AND ADDED FRIENDSHIP TO HOSPITALITY
WHAT REMORSE DO I FORESEE PAINTED UPON HIS FACE
THEY DARED NOT ASK A QUESTION AND EVEN BEGAN TO WISH HE WOULD CONTINUE SILENT UPON THE SUBJECT ON WHICH THEY FEARED TO LISTEN
AND NOW MADAM THE REASON OF MY DESIRE TO SPEAK WITH YOU--IS TO KNOW THE MEANS YOU THINK MOST PROPER TO PURSUE IN ORDER TO ACQUAINT LORD FREDERICK THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS LATE REPULSE THERE ARE HOPES OF YOUR PARTIALITY IN HIS FAVOUR DEFER THE EXPLANATION SHE REPLIED EAGERLY
SHE HAD ALL THE BOLDNESS OF INNOCENCE AND IN ADDITION A FORCE OF CHARACTER WHICH BROUGHT HER SAFELY THROUGH THE RISKS SHE RAN
MISS WOODLEY WAS OBLIGED THEREFORE TO ACT TO THE BEST OF HER OWN JUDGMENT ONLY AND LEAVE ALL EVENTS TO PROVIDENCE
FROM BATH SHE PAID SEVERAL VISITS WITH LADY LUNEHAM--ALL WERE ALIKE TEDIOUS AND MELANCHOLY
SOON AFTER BREAKFAST MR SANDFORD WITHDREW TO HIS OWN APARTMENT
AS YOU HAVE NOW HOWEVER FREELY AND POLITELY CONSENTED TO THE MANNER IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT YOU SHALL BREAK WITH HIM I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU A MOMENT LONGER UPON A SUBJECT ON WHICH I HAVE SO FREQUENTLY EXPLAINED MY WISHES BUT CONCLUDE IT BY ASSURING YOU THAT YOUR READY ACQUIESCENCE HAS GIVEN ME THE SINCEREST SATISFACTION I HOPE MR SANDFORD SAID SHE TURNING TO HIM WITH A SMILE I HAVE GIVEN YOU SATISFACTION LIKEWISE SANDFORD COULD NOT SAY YES AND WAS ASHAMED TO SAY NO
DO NOT YOU THEN MR SANDFORD ASKED DORRIFORTH
I WILL HEAR NO MORE COMPLAINTS AGAINST HER BUT I WILL WATCH HER CLOSELY MYSELF--AND IF I FIND HER MIND AND HEART SUCH AS MY SUSPICIONS HAVE OF LATE WHISPERED TOO FRIVOLOUS FOR THAT SUBSTANTIAL HAPPINESS I LOOK FOR WITH AN OBJECT SO BELOVED DEPEND UPON MY WORD--THE MARRIAGE SHALL YET BE BROKEN OFF I DEPEND UPON YOUR WORD
HE THEN SENT FOR ME TO THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND TOLD ME HE SHOULD BE BACK IN TWO DAYS TIME AND ADDED REMEMBER YOUR DUTY THAT DUTY I HOPE MADAM YOU WILL NOT REQUIRE ME TO EXPLAIN IN MORE DIRECT TERMS.--AS SOON AS MY LORD RETURNS I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT HE WILL ASK ME IF IT IS FULFILLED AND I SHALL BE UNDER THE GREATEST APPREHENSION SHOULD HIS COMMANDS NOT BE OBEYED
IN THE MEAN TIME MISS WOODLEY AND MATILDA WERE TALKING OVER THIS TRIFLING OCCURRENCE
FOR HE WAS MORE CONSISTENT IN HIS CHARACTER THAN TO SUFFER THE TENDERNESS HIS DAUGHTER'S PERIL HAD AWAKENED TO DERANGE THOSE PLANS WHICH HE HAD LONG PROJECTED
SIR EDWARD WAS NOT YOUNG OR HANDSOME
OH BY ALL MEANS LET HER LIVE AT ELMWOOD HOUSE TOO
LORD ELMWOOD HAS BEEN WITH YOU MADAM RETURNED SANDFORD VERY FREQUENTLY AND YET MR SANDFORD SAID LORD ELMWOOD INTERRUPTING HIM IT IS NEAR BED-TIME YOUR CONVERSATION KEEPS THE LADIES FROM RETIRING YOUR LORDSHIP'S DOES NOT SAID MISS MILNER FOR YOU SAY NOTHING BECAUSE MADAM I AM AFRAID TO OFFEND BUT DO NOT YOU ALSO HOPE TO PLEASE
NO NO--WE WILL HAVE NO DISTURBING THE DEAD READ HER LETTER THEN SAID SANDFORD AND BID HER REST IN PEACE IF IT IS IN MY POWER RETURNED HE TO GRANT WHAT SHE ASKS I WILL--BUT IF HER DEMAND IS WHAT I APPREHEND I CANNOT I WILL NOT BID HER REST BY COMPLYING
AS SOON AS THE BREAKFAST WAS REMOVED LORD ELMWOOD DREW THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND HOLDING IT TOWARDS SANDFORD SAID THAT MAY BE OF MORE VALUE TO YOU THAN IT IS TO ME THEREFORE I GIVE IT YOU SANDFORD CALLED UP A LOOK OF SURPRISE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE LETTER AGAIN
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR OF HIS RESTORED HEALTH WHEN HE WAS INFORMED HE WAS COMING DOWN TO ELMWOOD HOUSE FOR A FEW WEEKS IN THE STYLE OF ITS MASTER SANDFORD WITH ALL HIS RELIGIOUS AND HUMANE PRINCIPLES COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT IF THE LAD HAD BEEN PROPERLY PREPS WELL OUT OF THE WORLD AS IN IT HE WAS STILL LESS HIS FRIEND WHEN HE SAW HIM ARRIVE WITH HIS USUAL FLORID COMPLEXION
ELIZABETH INCHBALD WAS BORN ON THE 15TH OF OCTOBER 1753 AT STANDINGFIELD NEAR BURY ST EDMUNDS IN SUFFOLK;[1 ONE OF THE NUMEROUS OFFSPRING OF JOHN AND MARY SIMPSON
HE THEREFORE MADE ANSWER ONLY BY HIS LOOKS WHICH WERE FULL OF SUSPICION
I DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND YOU SO LIKE HIM NOR DID I MR DORRIFORTH EXPECT TO FIND YOU ANY THING LIKE WHAT YOU ARE NO?--PRAY WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND ME I EXPECTED TO FIND YOU AN ELDERLY MAN AND A PLAIN MAN THIS WAS SPOKEN IN AN ARTLESS MANNER BUT IN A TONE WHICH OBVIOUSLY DECLARED SHE THOUGHT HER GUARDIAN YOUNG AND HANDSOME
THE POWER DELEGATED BY THE CONFIDENTIAL TO THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THEIR SECRETS MISS WOODLEY WAS THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH TO ABUSE--BUT SHE WAS ALSO THE LAST WHO BY AN ACCOMMODATING COMPLACENCY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE GUILT OF HER FRIEND--AND THERE WAS NO GUILT EXCEPT THAT OF MURDER WHICH SHE THOUGHT EQUAL TO THE CRIME IN QUESTION IF IT WAS EVER PERPETRATED
VERY WELL REPLIED SANDFORD WITH INDIFFERENCE
FOR SHAME
FOR SHAME
THE QUARREL YOU AND YOUR WARD HAD ABOUT THE MASQUERADE WHAT OF THAT
SANDFORD LEFT HIM DETERMINED HOWEVER THAT LORD ELMWOOD SHOULD NOT BE ACCESSORY IN HIS GUILT AND THIS HE DECLARED
THE NEXT TIME HE CAME SHE DID SO ASSURING HIM IT WAS BY HER GUARDIAN'S DESIRE
WHEN PEOPLE EXPECT WHAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO HOPE TIS IMPERTINENT ASSURANCE TO COMPLAIN THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED I HAD A RIGHT TO HOPE SHE WOULD COME ANSWERED RUSHBROOK FOR SHE PROMISED SHE WOULD BUT WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO ASK HER THE RIGHT EVERY ONE HAS TO MAKE HIS TIME PASS AS AGREEABLY AS HE CAN BUT NOT AT THE EXPENCE OF ANOTHER I BELIEVE MR SANDFORD IT WOULD BE A HEAVY EXPENCE TO YOU TO SEE ME HAPPY
AND STARED ABOUT HIM WITH SO VIOLENT AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE THAT IT PARTOOK IN SOME DEGREE OF FEAR
AT PRESENT THERE IS NO ONE WITH HIM TO SHARE IN THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND HE IS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF DISCHARGING THAT DUTY HIMSELF
BUT BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON GIFFARD THE STEWARD TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT UPON HIM AND LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS LORD HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CONSENT HE HAD GIVEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE ADMITTED AT ELMWOOD CASTLE AND UPON WHAT RESTRICTIONS
BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER FROM THE FREQUENT PROOFS HE HAD EXPERIENCED OF HIS OWN INCONSTANCY HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE--AND THIS INTERFERENCE OF HER GUARDIAN THREATENED AN EXPLANATION OR A DISMISSION BEFORE HE BECAME THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIS OWN HEART.--ALARMED CONFOUNDED AND PROVOKED HE REPLIED BY HEAVEN I BELIEVE MR DORRIFORTH LOVES YOU HIMSELF AND IT IS JEALOUSY THAT MAKES HIM TREAT ME IN THIS MANNER FOR SHAME MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS PRESENT AND WHO TREMBLED WITH HORROR AT THE SACRILEGIOUS IDEA
NOR UPON THAT EVENT HAD HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RELIGIOUS VOW OF CELIBACY TO FLY THE ROOF OF TWO SUCH INNOCENT FEMALES AS MRS HORTON AND HER NIECE
AND WITHOUT RISKING THE ONE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT THE OTHER I THINK AT PRESENT THE RISK WOULD BE TOO HAZARDOUS AND SO I WISH YOU A GOOD NIGHT AND HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY
YOU SANDFORD CAN REASON WITH MODERATION
IF UNREPENTED IN THIS WORLD SHE WAS PROCEEDING--BUT THE ANXIETY HER FRIEND ENDURED WOULD NOT SUFFER HER TO BE FREE FROM THE APPREHENSION THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE POSITIVE ASSURANCE OF HER GUARDIAN IF HE AND LORD FREDERICK SHOULD MEET THE DUEL MIGHT STILL TAKE PLACE
AS SOON AS HIS BUSINESS WITH LORD ELMWOOD WAS SETTLED DORRIFORTH RETURNED HOME TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE EVENT WHICH MIGHT ENSUE FROM THIS MEETING
INCHBALD AND PUBLISHED BY G
AND HE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO CONVEY HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCES TO THEIR HOME IN HIS COACH SAFE FROM THE FURY OF THE ELEMENTS
THE SIMPSONS WHO WERE ROMAN CATHOLICS HELD A MODERATE FARM IN STANDINGFIELD AND RANKED AMONG THE GENTRY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ON FIRST SEEING HIM RUSHBROOK BLUSHED AT THE SECRET WITH WHICH HE WAS ENTRUSTED
I AM UNWORTHY OF THEIR SOCIETY
AS HE LAID HIS HAND UPON THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT TO OPEN IT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR BY LORD ELMWOOD'S VOICE HE WAS IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM
SANDFORD HAD BEEN THE TUTOR OF DORRIFORTH AS WELL AS OF HIS COUSIN LORD ELMWOOD AND BY THIS DOUBLE TIE SEEMED NOW ENTAILED UPON THE FAMILY
NOR WAS MISS WOODLEY MUCH LESS AFFECTED--LADY ELMWOOD WAS BEFORE THEIR EYES--MATILDA BEHELD HER IN HER DYING MOMENTS
THE FOURTH EDITION LONDON
THE FOURTH EDITION LONDON
THE FOURTH EDITION LONDON
THE FOURTH EDITION LONDON
AND OBSERVED ACCORDING TO SANDFORD'S PREDICTION THAT TIME WORE OFF THE IMPRESSION HER VISITS FIRST MADE
EVEN LADY MATILDA WAS NOT SO DEAR TO SANDFORD AS HER FATHER--AND HE LOVED HER MORE THAT SHE WAS LORD ELMWOOD'S CHILD THAN FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE
WOULD SHE HAVE THE WICKEDNESS TO IMAGINE WE ARE NOT ALL FRIENDS WITH HER MISS WOODLEY LEFT THE ROOM AND FOUND MISS MILNER ALMOST IN DESPAIR LEST SHE SHOULD HEAR LORD ELMWOOD'S CARRIAGE DRIVE OFF BEFORE HER FRIEND'S RETURN
IS IT A DREAM OR HAVE I SEEN HIM IT IS ALL A DREAM MY DEAR SAID MISS WOODLEY
THE CHARMS OF HER MIND AND OF HER FORTUNE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT BY HIS TUTOR
WHAT WAS YOUR OFFENCE CRIED SANDFORD
I WOULD ALSO HAVE WAITED UPON YOU MADAM AND HAVE DELIVERED MYSELF THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS LETTER
THE CONNOISSEURS IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED SHE MADE A FALSE CADENCE--BUT LORD ELMWOOD WAS NO CONNOISSEUR IN THE ART AND HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT
IT WAS THE HOPE OF SEEING AND CONVERSING WITH HER OF BEING ADMITTED AT ALL TIMES TO HER SOCIETY AS THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE THAT HAD RAISED HIS SPIRITS AND EFFECTED HIS PERFECT CURE BEYOND ANY OTHER CAUSE
HAVE I ANOTHER FRIEND ON EARTH
AND THE LAW OF HONOUR AND OF JUSTICE THOUGH IN THIS ONE INSTANCE CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF RELIGION ENJOINS THAT IF HE DEMANDS MY LIFE IN SATISFACTION FOR HIS WOUNDED FEELINGS IT IS HIS DUE
AND THAT YOU DO NOT REQUIRES MY WARMEST ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS SHE SAT DOWN AS IF OVERCOME BY ILL SPIRITS AND ILL HEALTH
IN HER EARLY AND MIDDLE LIFE SHE HAD BEEN AN INDIFFERENT CATHOLIC
IS THIS THE NIGHT OF THE MASQUERADE SAID HE
WHILE ALL THE DECEIVED PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE RUNNING EAGERLY TO SAVE THEMSELVES PAID NO REGARD TO HER TILL LOOKING FOR THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TERRIFIED THEY PERCEIVED THE STRATAGEM AND THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
WHO CRIED HE
WHEN DORRIFORTH WAS ALONE WITH SANDFORD HE EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT BEFORE HE HAD ONLY HINTED
BUT AS HE DID NOT SEE A FROWN UPON HER FACE HE CAUGHT HOLD OF HER HAND AND SAID PERSUASIVELY DO NOT BE OFFENDED WITH ME
YOU HAVE PRAYED FOR ME MY LORD I MAKE NO DOUBT SAID SHE AND SMILED AS IF THANKING HIM FOR THOSE PRAYERS
SHE THOUGHT SO MUCH UPON THE PROSPECT OF ACCOMPLISHING HER WISHES THAT SHE COULD ADMIT NO OTHER IDEA
BUT NOT TILL HE HAD ENTREATED SHE WOULD DINE THAT VERY DAY WITH HIM AND MR SANDFORD WHO WERE TO DINE WITHOUT OTHER COMPANY
BUT I BELIEVE MY LORD IT IS NOT SANDFORD AS SOON AS LORD ELMWOOD HAD ASKED THE LAST QUESTION RAN HASTILY TO THE TABLE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM TOOK SOMETHING FROM IT AND RETURNED TO HIS PLACE AGAIN--AND WHEN THE MAID SAID IT WAS NOT THE NIGHT OF THE MASQUERADE HE EXCLAIMED BUT IT IS MY LORD IT IS--YES IT IS AND SHEWING A NEWSPAPER IN HIS HAND POINTED TO THE PARAGRAPH WHICH CONTAINED THE INFORMATION
NO SAID MISS WOODLEY IN A LOW VOICE YOU HAVE NOT--SHE IS OFTEN THUS YES SAID MATILDA RAISING HER HEAD I AM FREQUENTLY SO WEAK THAT I CANNOT RESIST THE SMALLEST INCITEMENT TO GRIEF
WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM AND SHE HEARD THE DOOR SHUT AFTER HIM SHE SAID WITH AN INQUISITIVE THOUGHTFULNESS WHAT CAN MAKE GOOD PEOPLE SO SKILLED IN ALL THE WEAKNESSES OF THE BAD
SHE THEREFORE ENQUIRED WHERE HE WAS AND SENT HIM A NOTE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ACQUAINTING HIM WITH IT OFFERING AT THE SAME TIME AN APOLOGY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I DON'T KNOW MY LORD UPON MY WORD
HE CONCERTED WITH TWO OF HIS FAVOURITE COMPANIONS BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS ONE STRUGGLE MORE OF FAIR MEANS THIS WAS TOTALLY AGAINST HIS INCLINATION
STILL DORRIFORTH WAS IN SOME PERTURBATION BUT THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE WAS CONCEALED TILL THE DAY FOLLOWING WHEN ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE COMPANY'S DEPARTURE FROM THE CASTLE MISS MILNER AND MISS WOODLEY WERE DESIRED BY A SERVANT TO WALK INTO A SEPARATE APARTMENT IN WHICH THEY FOUND MR DORRIFORTH WITH MR SANDFORD WAITING FOR THEM
AND IF YOU CAN INFORM ME OF ANY OTHER TELL ME I BESEECH YOU INSTANTLY AND I WILL IMMEDIATELY BE GONE AND PURSUE YOUR DIRECTIONS MISS WOODLEY HESITATED
AND UPON THIS DOUBTFUL MEANING OF HIS WORDS SHE HUNG WITH THE STRONGEST AGITATION OF HOPE AND OF FEAR
AT LENGTH SHE ROSE UP AND FOLLOWED MISS WOODLEY TO THE OTHER APARTMENT
AND I SEE BY HER LOOKS THAT SHE WILL MEAN TO KEEP THEM
AND YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED YOUR MOTHER WHATEVER YOUR FATE SHOULD BE TO SUBMIT WITH PATIENCE YES REPLIED MATILDA AND I AM PREPARED FOR EVERY THING BUT MY FATHER'S REFUSAL TO MY DEAR MOTHER YOUR FATHER HAS NOT REFUSED YOUR MOTHER'S REQUEST REPLIED SANDFORD
AGAINST THAT SHORT EVENING HER TOILET WAS CONSULTED THE WHOLE DAY
BUT BEFORE HE HAD PROCEEDED FAR THE FEW FRIENDS THAT ACCOMPANIED HIM BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE IMPROBABILITY OF THEIR SUCCESS AGAINST A NOBLEMAN SURROUNDED BY SERVANTS WITH OTHER ATTENDANTS LIKEWISE AND PERHAPS EVEN COUNTENANCED BY THE FATHER OF THE LADY WHOM THEY PRESUMED TO TAKE FROM HIM
IT IS IN THE HEART OF THE LONDON THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS LOVED
IF HE OBSERVED HER BLUSHES HE WAS UNSUSPICIOUS OF THE CAUSE AND WENT ON
WHEN MATILDA WAS READY TO JOIN HER FATHER IN THE NEXT ROOM SHE FELT A TREMOR SEIZE HER THAT MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM
LONDON
LONDON
AND YET SAID SHE RECOLLECTING HERSELF AND YET I BELIEVE HIS BEING FAULTLESS WAS THE FIRST CAUSE OF MY PASSION THUS SHE TALKED ON--SOMETIMES IN ANGER SOMETIMES APPARENTLY JESTING--TILL HER SERVANT CAME TO LET HER KNOW THE DINNER WAS SERVED
WHILE WITH EVERY OTHER PERSON SHE WAS THE PRINCIPLE THE CAUSE UPON WHOM A WHOLE PARTY DEPENDED FOR CONVERSATION CARDS MUSICK OR DANCING WITH MR SANDFORD SHE FOUND THAT SHE WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE
WHEN THE SERVANT HAD LEFT RUSHBROOK ALONE THE PERTURBATION OF HIS MIND WAS SO GREAT THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH UNDETERMINED WHETHER TO GO TO BED OR TO RUSH INTO HIS UNCLE'S APARTMENT AND AT HIS FEET BEG FOR THAT COMPASSION UPON HIS DAUGHTER WHICH HE FEARED HE HAD DENIED HER
THOUGH A CHURCHMAN HE BORE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE IMPATIENCE OF ONE OF THE LAITY
BESIDES ONE OF HIS SERVANTS ATTENDED THE CARRIAGE
THERE CRIED LADY EVANS I DESIRE YOU WILL GIVE YOUR OPINION OF HER AND I AM SORRY I CANNOT STAY TO HEAR IT SAYING THIS SHE CURTSIED AND TOOK HER LEAVE
IF SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AGREEABLE RETURNED MISS WOODLEY I DARE SAY SHE WOULD AND SHE LOOKED AT LORD ELMWOOD WHILE SHE SPOKE THOUGH SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY ADDRESS HIM
FOR WHEN HIS ASSISTANCE WAS SUPPLICATED IN DISTRESS HIS ROUGH TONES ALWAYS TOOK A PLAINTIVE KEY
IN LEICESTER SQUARE
COMPARED WITH THE STYLE OF SUCH A MASTER AS THACKERAY IT SINKS AT ONCE INTO INSIGNIFICANCE
MISS MILNER FLEW TO HER GLASS ADJUSTED HER DRESS AND IN HER LOOKS EXPRESSED EVERY SIGN OF PALPITATION--BUT IN VAIN SHE KEEPS HER EYE FIXED UPON THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT
BUT FINDING HER LIFE LEAVING HER FAST SHE RESERVED THIS LAST TOKEN OF LOVE FOR HER DAUGHTER--WITH A STRUGGLE SHE LIFTED HERSELF FROM HER PILLOW CLUNG TO HER CHILD--AND DIED IN HER ARMS
THE SPIRIT OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IS CERTAINLY PRESENT IN THE BOOK BUT IT IS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF FRANCE RATHER THAN OF ENGLAND
TO THOSE WHO SINCERELY LOVE EVERY CHANGE OF SITUATION OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE OBJECT BELOVED APPEARS AN ADVANTAGE
TO BESTOW UPON THAT CHILD HIS AFFECTIONS WOULD BE HE IMAGINED STILL IN SOME SORT TO DIVIDE THEM WITH THE MOTHER
AND WHEN HE SAW BY HER STRUGGLES THAT SHE COULD NOT EAT HE TOOK HER PLATE FROM HER
MR SANDFORD SELDOM SAID MY DEAR TO ANY ONE
BUT HER SOLICITOUS FRIEND GAVE LORD ELMWOOD A LOOK WHICH IMPLIED THAT IT MIGHT BE INJURIOUS TO HER AND HE RETIRED
BUT IT IS CERTAIN HE EXPECTED HE HAD SOME REQUEST TO MAKE WITH WHICH IT MIGHT BE WRONG FOR HIM TO COMPLY AND THEREFORE HE AVOIDED HEARING WHAT IT WAS
WHAT CONFUSION
I AM NO LONGER THE PHILOSOPHER BUT THE RUFFIAN--I HAVE TREATED WITH AN UNPARDONABLE INSULT A YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHOSE ONLY OFFENCE WAS LOVE AND A FOND DESIRE TO INSINUATE HIMSELF INTO THE FAVOUR OF HIS MISTRESS
LUCIFER WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE ANGELS IN PARADISE HOW DO YOU KNOW SAID MISS MILNER
AND AT LENGTH REPRESENTED TO HER HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE NECESSITY THAT MR DORRIFORTH AND SHE NO LONGER SHOULD REMAIN UNDER THE SAME ROOF THIS WAS LIKE THE STROKE OF SUDDEN DEATH TO MISS MILNER AND CLINGING TO LIFE SHE ENDEAVOURED TO AVERT THE BLOW BY PRAYERS AND BY PROMISES
BUT TELL ME OF MY FATHER SAID MATILDA
THE POST MARK DENOTING FROM WHENCE IT CAME THE NAME OF MILNER LODGE WRITTEN ON THE TOP WERE ALL SOURCES OF PLEASURE--AND SHE READ SLOWLY EVERY LINE IT CONTAINED TO PROCRASTINATE THE PLEASING EXPECTATION SHE ENJOYED TILL SHE SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE NAME OF DORRIFORTH
MISS MILNER TOOK UP THE LETTER--LOOKED EARNESTLY AT THE HANDWRITING ON THE OUTSIDE--AT THE SEAL--INSPECTED INTO ITS FOLDS--AND SEEMED TO WISH BY SOME EQUIVOCAL METHOD TO GUESS AT THE CONTENTS WITHOUT HAVING THE COURAGE TO COME AT THE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THEM
EVEN MY PASSION MAY DECLINE IN THAT EXPECTATION THEN--THE FAILURE OF WHICH YOURSELF MUST ANSWER FOR--I WILL REPEAT AS MUCH OF THIS DISCOURSE AS SHALL BE PROPER HERE RUSHBROOK COMMUNICATED HIS HAVING BEEN TO SEE LADY MATILDA FOR WHICH SANDFORD REPROVED HIM BUT IN LESS RIGOROUS TERMS THAN HE GENERALLY USED IN HIS REPROOFS
FOR YOU FIND YOU WOULD BE DECEIVED DID YOU NOT TRUST TO PERSONS WHO KNOW BETTER THAN YOURSELF
THIS CASE HAS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A THEATRICAL ANECDOTE TOLD I THINK BY COLLY CIBBER
HOPE IS EVER APT TO INTERPRET THE SLIGHTEST WORDS TO ITS OWN USE AND A LOVER'S HOPE IS BEYOND ALL OTHERS SANGUINE I NEVER GAVE LORD FREDERICK HOPE BUT YOU NEVER PLUNGED HIM INTO DESPAIR HIS PURSUIT INTIMATES THAT I NEVER HAVE BUT HE HAS NO OTHER PROOF HOWEVER LIGHT AND FRIVOLOUS YOU HAVE BEEN UPON FRIVOLOUS SUBJECTS YET I MUST OWN MISS MILNER THAT I DID EXPECT WHEN A CASE OF THIS IMPORTANCE CAME SERIOUSLY BEFORE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE DISCOVERED A PROPER STABILITY IN YOUR BEHAVIOUR I DO SIR
IGNORANT OF A CERTAIN DECORUM WHICH ATTENDED ALL LORD ELMWOOD'S ACTIONS HE SUSPECTED THAT HIS CHILD MIGHT BE IN WANT
DORRIFORTH ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROPRIETY OF THIS ADVICE BUT LAMENTED THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING HIS WARD AS TO THE QUALITY OF HER LOVER
OR HAD SHE BEEN THE FRAILEST THING ON EARTH HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE HARD UPON HER IN ALL THE ACCOUNTS OF HER CONDUCT HE GAVE TO HER GUARDIAN
BESIDES ATTENDANTS SHE HAD WITH HER A GENTLEMAN AND LADY DISTANT RELATIONS OF HER MOTHER'S WHO THOUGHT IT BUT A PROPER TESTIMONY OF THEIR CIVILITY TO ATTEND HER PART OF THE WAY BUT WHO SO MUCH ENVIED HER GUARDIAN THE TRUST MR MILNER HAD REPOSED IN HIM THAT AS SOON AS THEY HAD DELIVERED HER SAFE INTO HIS CARE THEY RETURNED
SHE STARTED WHEN SHE BEHELD WHO IT WAS
LADY ELMWOOD AT FIRST ONLY UNHAPPY BECAME AT LAST PROVOKED
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONVERSATION HE SAID RUSHBROOK BEGGED FOR TIME I HAVE GIVEN HIM TIME HAVE I NOT CRIED LORD ELMWOOD
YET AS YOU SEEM IN DOUBT AS TO THE REALITY OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD PERHAPS THIS CONFIRMATION OF IT MAY FALL VERY LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST NEWS
AND IN THIS TENDENCY TO MAGNIFY TRIFLES WAS DISCOVERABLE THE NEVER-FAILING SYMPTOM OF ARDENT LOVE
IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THIS HER HEALTH BECAME IMPAIRED FROM THE INDISPOSITION OF HER MIND
YET LORD FREDERICK DOUBTED THE SINCERITY OF THIS AND WOULD STILL HAVE HAD THE DELICACY NOT TO HAVE ENTERED LORD ELMWOOD'S HOUSE HAD HE NOT BEEN ENCOURAGED BY MISS MILNER AND EMBOLDENED BY HIS LOVE
AND TO MR RUSHBROOK WHO FROM HIS CONSCIOUS LOVE ONLY BOWED AT AN HUMBLE DISTANCE SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WITH EVERY LOOK AND GESTURE OF THE TENDEREST ESTEEM
AND ADDED WHAT PAIN IT GAVE HER TO LEAVE THE CHILD BEHIND AS HE HAD AGAIN CRIED TO COME AWAY WITH HER GO FOR HIM THEN TO-MORROW SAID LORD ELMWOOD AND BRING HIM HOME HOME SHE REPEATED WITH SURPRISE
THIS LAST ADVICE SEEMED INSPIRED BY THE AID OF WINE
BUT SUFFER ME TO OWN MY FOLLY TO YOU--TO ENTREAT YOUR SOOTHING FRIENDSHIP TO FREE ME FROM MY WEAKNESS
SOMETIMES HE STRUGGLED TO SUBDUE HIS ANGER BUT OFTENER STROVE TO SUPPRESS TEARS OF PITY FOR HER HAPLESS STATE
LORD ELMWOOD HAD BEEN AWAY HALF THE DAY HAD DINED ABROAD AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO TAKE SOME NOTICE OF HIS RETURN
HE CONTINUED I WAS TO BLAME THAT UPON A NICE PUNCTILIO I LEFT YOU SO LONG WITHOUT MY VISITS AND WITHOUT MY COUNSEL
MATILDA LOOKED IN THIS WOMAN'S FACE AND SEEING SHE BORE THE FEATURES OF HER SEX WHILE HER OWN KNOWLEDGE REACHED NONE OF THOSE WORTHLESS CHARACTERS OF WHICH THIS PERSON WAS A SPECIMEN SHE IMAGINED THAT NONE OF THOSE COULD LOOK AS SHE DID AND THEREFORE FOUND CONSOLATION IN HER SEEMING TENDERNESS
IT WAS HIS DESIGN TO PLEAD TO ARGUE TO IMPLORE NAY EVEN TO THREATEN LONG BEFORE HE PUT HIS THREATS IN FORCE
HER RELUCTANCE HE IMPUTED HOWEVER MORE TO THE KNOWN PARTIALITY OF HER GUARDIAN FOR THE ADDRESSES OF SIR EDWARD THAN TO ANY MOTIVE WHICH DEPENDED UPON HERSELF
AND HER EYE GLANCED AT HIM FULL OF REPROACH
OF HER FATHER SHE DID NOT THINK--SHE DARED NOT--ONE SINGLE MOMENT THAT THOUGHT INTRUDED BUT SHE HURRIED IT AWAY--IT WAS TOO BITTER
AND YET MR SANDFORD SAID SHE IF IT IS SO WHY ARE YOU LESS CHEERFUL THAN YOU WERE
I DO NOT WISH FOR A PRESENT MISS MILNER WHAT NOT FROM ME
LET ME RECOLLECT MYSELF FIRST AND SHE LOOKED WITH A TIMID DOUBT UPON HER FRIEND TO ASK IF IT WAS PROPER
BUT MISS MILNER THOUGHT THAT AN ABODE IN HEAVEN MIGHT BE STILL BETTER THAN ALL THIS AND SHE HAD NO DOUBT BUT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD GO THITHER
INSTEAD OF THE ANGER WITH WHICH HE WAS PREPARED TO BEGIN HIS VOICE INVOLUNTARILY SOFTENED AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE SAID HE BEGAN MY DEAR MISS MILNER SHE EXPECTED HE WAS ANGRY AND IN HER CONFUSION HIS GENTLENESS WAS LOST UPON HER
HE SHOOK ME BY THE HAND REPLIED SANDFORD
BUT IN HIS OWN MIND DETERMINED HOW LONG THIS PATIENCE SHOULD CONTINUE--NO LONGER THAN IT SERVED AS THE MEANS TO PROVE HIS OBEDIENCE AND BY THAT ARTIFICE TO SECURE HIS BETTER RECEPTION AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD
HE LOOKED PROVOKED BEYOND MEASURE
FOR HER GRANDFATHER'S SAKE DO NOT REFUSE THIS--TO THE CHILD OF HIS CHILD WHOM HE ENTRUSTED TO YOUR CARE DO NOT REFUSE IT
HER LADYSHIP HAS LEFT ONE CHILD BY THE EARL A DAUGHTER ABOUT FIFTEEN LORD ELMWOOD HAD SO MUCH FEELING UPON READING THIS AS TO LAY DOWN THE PAPER AND NOT TAKE IT UP AGAIN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES--NOR DID HE TASTE HIS CHOCOLATE DURING THIS INTERVAL BUT LEANED HIS ELBOW ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND
HOW I AM TO IMPRESS HER WITH A SENSE OF THAT WHICH IS FOR HER ADVANTAGE YOU CAN WORK NO MIRACLES REPLIED SANDFORD YOU ARE NOT HOLY ENOUGH AND YET MY WARD ANSWERED DORRIFORTH APPEARS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MYSTERY
FOR THEY WERE NOT OBSERVATIONS OF MY OWN
THEIR PASSIONS FOR EACH OTHER JUST THE SAME--PURE--WHITE AS SNOW AND I DARE SAY NOT WARMER REPLIED MISS MILNER
WHAT AM I TO SAY TO MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR OPINION OF ME
AND AGAIN HE COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM UTTERING HIS INDIGNATION
MR SANDFORD MY LORD CONTINUED THE STEWARD SENT ME WORD OF THE NEWS BUT LEFT IT TO MY OWN DISCRETION WHETHER I WOULD MAKE YOUR LORDSHIP ACQUAINTED WITH IT OR NOT
AND IF YOU HAD CALLED IT SORROWFUL THE EPITHET WOULD HAVE SUITED AS WELL MISS MILNER SAID HER GUARDIAN I DID NOT BRING YOU HERE TO CONTEND WITH MR SANDFORD THEN WHY SIR BRING HIM HITHER
MISS MILNER THIS IS THE OLD ARGUMENT
BEHOLDING HIMSELF SEPARATED FROM HER BY A BARRIER NEVER TO BE REMOVED HE VOWED IN THE DEEP TORMENTS OF HIS REVENGE NEVER TO BE REMINDED OF HER BY ONE INDIVIDUAL OBJECT
AGREEABLE RETURNED SANDFORD ANGRILY--"HAS SHE THEN A QUARREL WITH ANY BODY HERE
GOOD HEAVEN CRIED MISS WOODLEY
GOOD NIGHT SIR SANDFORD BOWED WITH HUMILITY AND THEY WENT TO THEIR SEPARATE BEDCHAMBERS
AND YET I CAN VENTURE TO DECLARE SIR EDWARD WILL NEVER POSSESS AN ATOM OF IT I AM SORRY FOR BOTH YOUR SAKES THAT THESE ARE YOUR SENTIMENTS HE REPLIED
MR SANDFORD
HER CARE BEING EVER EMPLOYED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE LORD FREDERICK HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF IT
I THANK YOU FOR CALLING HIM SO
IT WAS NOT NOW TILL THE EVENING THAT RUSHBROOK HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF RENEWING THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BEEN SO BARBAROUSLY INTERRUPTED
WILL YOU DINE FIRST SAID MISS WOODLEY
BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMETHING IN FAVOUR OF HER CHILD I THINK NOT HE REPLIED
SHE DURING THIS TIME WAS AT THE SCENE OF PLEASURE SHE HAD PAINTED TO HERSELF AND ALL THE PLEASURE IT GAVE HER WAS THAT SHE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD NEVER DESIRE TO GO TO A MASQUERADE AGAIN
IS IT THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE
DORRIFORTH BRED AT ST OMER'S IN ALL THE SCHOLASTIC RIGOUR OF THAT COLLEGE WAS BY EDUCATION AND THE SOLEMN VOWS OF HIS ORDER A ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST--BUT NICELY DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND THE SUPERSTITIOUS PART OF THAT CHARACTER AND ADOPTING THE FORMER ONLY HE POSSESSED QUALITIES NOT UNWORTHY THE FIRST PROFESSORS OF CHRISTIANITY
AND DORRIFORTH'S PECULIAR GRAVITY FREQUENTLY RIGOUR COULD NOT BUT MAKE THEIR WHOLE PARTY LESS CHEERFUL THAN IT HAD BEEN
HIS UNCLE MADE A SLIGHT RETURN TO THE SALUTATION BUT CONTINUED THE RECITAL HE HAD BEGUN TO SANDFORD
FOR GREAT AS HIS COMPASSION FOR HIM WAS IN HIS PRESENT STATE IT WAS NOT OF SUFFICIENT FORCE TO URGE HIM TO GIVE A PROMISE HE DID NOT MEAN TO PERFORM
NOR OUGHT YOU TO DOUBT THE TRUTH OF WHAT I ADVANCE WHEN I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU HAVE NOT THE SMALLEST REASON TO HOPE YOUR LOVE WILL BE RETURNED
AND THE VICISSITUDES OF HER PROSPECT AT LENGTH GAVE TO HER BEHAVIOUR AN AIR OF CAPRICE WHICH NOT ALL HER FOLLIES HAD TILL NOW PRODUCED
THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE ENCOURAGED HER TO LOOK ONCE MORE--AND THEN SHE RIVETED HER EYES UPON HIM
AND AS HE WAS THE PERSON WHO MOST INFLUENCED THE OPINION OF HER GUARDIAN HE BECAME TO HER VERY SOON AN OBJECT NOT MERELY OF DISLIKE BUT OF ABHORRENCE
SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS ATTENTION TO HER BUT HER HEART THANKED HIM FOR HIS ATTENTION TO HIS DAUGHTER
I HOPE THEY WON'T QUARREL SAID MRS HORTON MEANING THAT SHE THOUGHT THEY WOULD
DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
HE THEN LAID IT ON THE TABLE AND BEGAN AGAIN TO UNDRESS
THE MOMENT THE OPERA WAS FINISHED SHE FLEW HASTILY DOWN STAIRS AS IF TO FLY FROM THE SUFFERINGS SHE EXPERIENCED
THOSE HE KEPT FAST CLOSED FOR FEAR LORD ELMWOOD SHOULD PERCEIVE IT MISS WOODLEY WITH ALL HER MINUTE INTELLIGENCE DID NOT HOWEVER ACQUAINT MATILDA THAT RUSHBROOK FOLLOWED HER TO THE WINDOW WHEN THE EARL WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND SANDFORD HALF ASLEEP AT THE OTHER END OF IT AND INQUIRED RESPECTFULLY BUT ANXIOUSLY FOR HER
MATILDA NIMBLY OPENED THE DOOR AND CRIED MR RUSHBROOK I AM COME TO COMFORT YOU THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE SAID HE RISING IN RAPTURE TO RECEIVE HER EVEN IN THE MIDST OF ALL HIS SADNESS
THAT ESTABLISHED HER CLAIM TO CONTEND AT LEAST FOR SUCCESS
OH MISS MILNER CRIED HE WITH A VOICE AND MANNER THAT COULD GIVE LITTLE SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE SAID I AM OVERJOYED AT THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU EVEN THOUGH IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENTAL MEETING SHE WAS EVIDENTLY GLAD TO SEE HIM
RUSHBROOK IN VAIN ENTREATED LORD ELMWOOD
HE SAW HER APPREHENSIONS IN HER DISTRACTED FACE DISHEVELED HAIR AND THE WHOLE OF HER FORLORN APPEARANCE--YET NOTWITHSTANDING HIS FORMER RESOLUTIONS HE COULD NOT RESIST THE DESIRE OF FULFILLING ALL HER DREADFUL EXPECTATIONS
ON BEHOLDING THE PRESENT PARTY IT REQUIRED NOT HIS SAGACITY TO SEE AT THE FIRST VIEW THAT THEY WERE ALL UNEASY
BUT THE OFFENDER DID NOT SO EASILY PARDON HER
BUT UPON HER BROW AND IN EVERY LINEAMENT OF HER FACE WAS MARKED THAT HIS DEATH WAS AN EVENT SHE WOULD NOT FOR A DAY SURVIVE
NO DOUBT THIS KIND OF LIGHTHEARTEDNESS WAS THE BEST ANTIDOTE TO THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING SALUTED WITH VOLLEYS OF POTATOES AND BROKEN BOTTLES AS THE SIDDONSES WERE BY THE CITIZENS OF LIVERPOOL FOR HAVING VENTURED TO APPEAR ON THEIR STAGE WITHOUT HAVING EVER PLAYED BEFORE THE KING
THOUGH VERY SOON AFTER SHE WOULD NOT BUT HAVE HEARD IT FOR THE WORLD
THE COLOUR FLEW TO LORD ELMWOOD'S FACE AS SHE DELIVERED THIS SHORT SENTENCE
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW LORD ELMWOOD DINED FROM HOME FOR IF HE HAD HE SHOULD HAVE DINED IN HIS OWN APARTMENT RUSHBROOK WAS STILL MORE OBLIGED TO HIM FOR ALL THIS
THIS PRECEPTOR HELD WITH A MAGISTERIAL POWER THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS PUPIL'S PASSIONS
ONLY SECOND ME AND I WILL ENTREAT LORD ELMWOOD TO BE RECONCILED--TO SEE AND OWN HER YOUR VANITY WOULD BE EQUAL TO YOUR TEMERITY--_YOU ENTREAT
AT THIS INSTANT A BELL RUNG FROM THE CHAMBER ABOVE
THUS THE READER OF MODERN NOVELS IS INEVITABLY STRUCK IN A SIMPLE STORY BY A SENSE OF EMPTINESS AND THINNESS WHICH MAY WELL BLIND HIM TO HIGH INTRINSIC MERITS
AND AS THIS RECONCILIATION WAS SINCERE THEY EACH WITHOUT RESERVE GAVE THEIR OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT THAT HAD CAUSED THE MISUNDERSTANDING
PERHAPS YOU DON'T REMEMBER LADY ELMWOOD DON'T I CRIED HE OH CLASPING HIS HANDS AND LIFTING UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN SHALL I EVER FORGET HER THAT MOMENT LORD ELMWOOD OPENED THE DOOR
IT WAS NOW AGAIN QUITE NIGHT
HE SAT DOWN WITH THE CONFESSION OF THE OBLIGATION UPON EVERY FEATURE OF HIS FACE
BLESS MY SOUL GEORGE HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING CRIED THE WOMAN
BUT I KNOW YOU DO IT FOR HER GOOD WELL MISS MILNER CRIED DORRIFORTH AND THE MOST CUTTING THING HE COULD SAY SINCE I FIND MY PROPOSAL OF THE COUNTRY HAS PUT YOU OUT OF HUMOUR I SHALL MENTION IT NO MORE WITH ALL THAT QUANTITY OF RESENTMENT ANGER OR RAGE WHICH SOMETIMES BOILED IN THE VEINS OF MISS MILNER SHE WAS YET NEVER WANTING IN THAT RESPECT TOWARDS HER GUARDIAN WHICH WITH-HELD HER FROM EVER UTTERING ONE ANGRY SENTENCE DIRECTED IMMEDIATELY TO HIM
OH SIR SAID HE TO SANDFORD I COME TO INTREAT YOUR INTEREST IN WHAT EDWARDS SAID SANDFORD WITH A MILD VOICE
RECEIVE HER INTO YOUR HOUSEHOLD BE HER CONDITION THERE EVER SO ABJECT
BUT THE RESERVE AND EVEN INDIFFERENCE THAT SHE HAD SO WELL ASSUMED FOR A FEW DAYS AND WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE EFFECTED HER DESIGN SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE TO PERSEVERE IN WITHOUT CALLING LEVITY TO THEIR AID
THEN LOOKING AT MATILDA SAID I'LL TELL YOU SIR SOME OTHER TIME DID YOU NAME ME BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD CRIED SHE EAGERLY AND TERRIFIED
ANOTHER WAS ERRONEOUS AND HE CHANGED IT FOR A BETTER
SHE FELT AN INWARD SHAME AT THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THESE QUALITIES THAT SHE NEVER KNEW BEFORE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED OF ALL HER PRIDE HAD SHE NOT POSSESSED A DEGREE OF SPIRIT BEYOND THE GENERALITY OF HER SEX--SUCH A DEGREE AS EVEN MR SANDFORD WITH ALL HIS PENETRATION DID NOT EXPECT
HE PLACED HIMSELF ON THE SETTEE BY HER AND WITH THE UTMOST TENDERNESS REVERENCE AND PITY ENTREATED HER NOT TO BE CONCERNED AT AN ACCIDENT IN WHICH HE AND HE ALONE HAD BEEN TO BLAME
OF THE MANY RESTLESS NIGHTS THAT MISS MILNER PASSED THIS WAS NOT ONE
IT WAS ON A DARK EVENING IN THE MONTH OF MARCH THAT LADY MATILDA ACCOMPANIED BY SANDFORD AND MISS WOODLEY ARRIVED AT ELMWOOD CASTLE THE MAGNIFICENT SEAT OF HER FATHER
LORD MARGRAVE'S HOUSE TO WHICH HE HAD GONE PREVIOUS TO THIS OCCASION WAS SITUATED IN THE LONELY PART OF A WELL-KNOWN FOREST NOT MORE THAN TWENTY MILES DISTANT FROM LONDON
WHAT HAVE YOU ASKED OF MY FATHER THAT HE HAS DENIED YOU I HAVE ASKED FOR THAT REPLIED HE WHICH IS DEARER TO ME THAN MY LIFE BE SATISFIED THEN RETURNED SHE FOR YOU SHALL HAVE IT DEAR MATILDA
DO NOT FORCE MY TOIL TO LIBELS--OR WHAT IS EQUALLY PERNICIOUS--PANEGYRIC ON THE UNWORTHY
THERE IS NO LOCAL COLOUR IN IT NO COMPLEXITY OF DETAIL NOR VIOLENCE OF CONTRAST
RUSHBROOK THEREFORE BOWED HUMBLY AND WHAT WAS MORE TO HIS ADVANTAGE HE LOOKED HUMBLY
BUT HE RETURNED HOME RESOLVED TO WRITE WHAT HE DURST NOT SPEAK--HE DID SO--HE OFFERED HIS SERVICES HIS PURSE HIS HOUSE--THEY WERE REJECTED WITH CONTEMPT AND A STRONGER PROHIBITION THAN EVER GIVEN TO HIS VISITS
WHEN MISS WOODLEY MADE HER APPEARANCE AT DINNER SANDFORD WHO HAD NOT SEEN HER SINCE THE INVITATION AND DID NOT KNOW OF IT LOOKED AMAZED
AND IF THESE VOLUMES SHOULD BE ATTENDED BY THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED HER OTHER WRITINGS TO THAT DIVINITY AND THAT ALONE SHE SHALL ATTRIBUTE THEIR SUCCESS
AND BEHOLDING IN THAT LITTLE CIRCUMFERENCE A WEIGHT OF FOLLY THAT HE WISHED TO ERADICATE HE BEGAN TO TOIL IN THE VINEYARD EAGERLY COURTING HER DETESTATION OF HIM IN THE HOPE HE COULD ALSO MAKE HER ABOMINATE HERSELF
LADY MATILDA AND SANDFORD WERE BOTH IN THEIR TURNS INFORMED OF THIS TRAIT IN MR RUSHBROOK'S CHARACTER
BUT THAT HAVING YIELDED TO THE SALLIES OF HIS ANGER HE MUST NOW GO THROUGH NUMEROUS OTHER PROBATIONS IF MISS FENTON WAS ADMIRED BY DORRIFORTH BY SANDFORD SHE WAS ADORED--AND INSTEAD OF PLACING HER AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISS MILNER HE SPOKE OF HER AS OF ONE ENDOWED BEYOND MISS MILNER'S POWER OF IMITATION
AND MY IMMEDIATE CARE SHALL BE TO FIND A GENTLEMAN WHO WILL ACCOMPANY ME THE OFFICER WITHDREW AND WHEN DORRIFORTH WAS AGAIN ALONE HE WAS GOING ONCE MORE TO REFLECT BUT HE DURST NOT
DO YOU SAY SHE HAD ON A PETTICOAT SAID SANDFORD TO THE MAN
A SHORT INTERVAL OF SILENCE FOLLOWED DURING WHICH SHE SUFFERED TORTURES FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH HE WOULD NEXT ADDRESS HER--TWO SECONDS GAVE HER THIS REPLY
AND WHEN DORRIFORTH ENTERED THE ROOM JUST BEFORE DINNER POOR HARRY RUSHBROOK WAS INTRODUCED AS THE SON OF A LADY WHO FREQUENTLY VISITED THERE
TO NATURE AND PROVIDENCE HE LEFT THE WHOLE
WHEN DORRIFORTH MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE NEXT DAY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD THROWN FROM HIS HEART A LOAD OF CARES
AND FOR SOME TIME DID NOT PERCEIVE BUT THAT HIS UNCLE WAS PERFECTLY ATTENTIVE
BUT ABOVE ALL--HER FEARS CONFIRMED HER THAT IT WAS HIM
HE HAD BEHELD THIS AND HE HAD HEARD HER INSULTED BY THE LICENTIOUS PROPOSALS OF A NOBLEMAN FROM WHOM THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION TO BE DEMANDED BECAUSE SHE HAD NO FRIEND TO VINDICATE HER HONOUR
HE RETURNED IN THE EVENING SEEMINGLY RECONCILED NOR WAS A WORD MENTIONED OF THE INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED IN THE FORMER PART OF THE DAY
NOW I KNOW;"----AND THEN CHECKED HERSELF AS IF SHE KNEW TOO MUCH
MISS WOODLEY CURTSIED AS SHE FOLLOWED
AND OH
AND OH
FOR THE VOLUME BEING MERELY TAKEN FROM HER AT MR RUSHBROOK'S COMMAND SHE FELT AN INSULT
BUT EVEN THE SERVANT WHO WAITED UPON HER HAD TOO MUCH SENSIBILITY TO TELL HER AND ANSWERED HE DID NOT KNOW MISS WOODLEY HOWEVER SOON LEARNED THE REASON AND GROANING WITH THE PAINFUL SECRET INFORMED HER MR RUSHBROOK ON THAT DAY WAS COME OF AGE MY BIRTH-DAY WAS LAST WEEK REPLIED MATILDA
LORD ELMWOOD PROPOSED A WIFE TO HIM
AND THE WEIGHT OF OBLIGATIONS WITH WHICH HE WAS OPPRESSED MADE HIM LONG FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELIEVE HIMSELF BY EXPRESSIONS
AND SANDFORD ON HIS PART BELIEVING HE HAD FORMED AN ILLIBERAL OPINION OF LORD ELMWOOD'S HEIR THOUGH HE TOOK NO PAINS TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS OPINION WAS CHANGED YET RESOLVED TO MAKE HIM RESTITUTION UPON EVERY OCCASION THAT OFFERED
SHE WAS MISTAKEN--THE MOMENT SHE MENTIONED IT TO LORD ELMWOOD HE DESIRED HER SOMEWHAT STERNLY NOT TO THINK OF BEING THERE SHE WAS VEXED AT THE PROHIBITION BUT MORE AT THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED AND BOLDLY SAID THAT SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY GO SHE EXPECTED A REBUKE FOR THIS BUT WHAT ALARMED HER MUCH MORE HE SAID NOT A WORD
AND THUS BY ACCIDENT AM I COME TO THE TRUTH OF ALL YOUR PROFESSIONS RUSHBROOK KNEW THAT HE LOVED
HE THEN TURNED TO MISS MILNER--"CAN YOU SAY THE SAME BY HIM SHE SPREAD HER HANDS OVER HER EYES AND EXCLAIMED OH HEAVENS I BELIEVE YOU CAN SAY SO RETURNED SANDFORD
AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MRS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA SHE REPLIED NO I THANK YOU MA'AM IN A VOICE SO LANGUID COMPARED WITH HER USUAL ONE THAT DORRIFORTH LIFTED UP HIS EYES FROM THE BOOK
ASK MR RUSHBROOK SAID SANDFORD PREVAIL ON HIM TO SPEAK FOR YOU
AT LENGTH SHE FOUND HERSELF IN LONDON--IN THE HOUSE OF HER GUARDIAN--AND THAT GUARDIAN NO LONGER BOUND TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT ENJOINED TO MARRY
THIS TRIUMPH HOWEVER WAS BUT SHORT--A MONTH ONLY AFTER THE RETURN OF LORD ELMWOOD THE DUKE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER FOR HIS CONDUCT AND WAS LEFT WHERE THEY MET SO DEFACED WITH SCARS AS NEVER AGAIN TO ENDANGER THE HONOUR OF A HUSBAND
TO THIS SANDFORD RECEIVED NO ANSWER
DO NOT IMAGINE BECAUSE YOU SEE ME HERE THAT I APPROVE MY CONDUCT
AND HE PARTED FROM HIS PATRON WITH CONGRATULATIONS UPON HIS WISDOM AND WITH GIVING HIM THE WARMEST ASSURANCES OF HIS FIRM RELIANCE ON HIS WORD LORD ELMWOOD HAVING COME TO THIS RESOLUTION WAS MORE COMPOSED THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE
AND FEARED HE HAD UNDERTAKEN A TASK HE WAS TOO WEAK TO EXECUTE--THE PROTECTION OF A YOUNG WOMAN OF FASHION
SHE WAITED UPON HIM TIMOROUSLY AND WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY DISTASTE AT HIS LATE CONDUCT WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND WITH THE UTMOST WARMTH TO RECEIVE HER
WHY MADAM CRIED SANDFORD LOOKING OVER THE CATALOGUE WHERE HER PURCHASES WERE MARKED BY A PENCIL DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
ITS SUBJECT IS A GROUP OF TWO OR THREE INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INTERACTION FORMS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF THE BOOK
YOU MAY HAVE CAUSE TO RECALL IT I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SAID REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE SAID YOU GRANT LADY ELMWOOD'S REQUEST--YOU CANNOT RECALL THESE WORDS NOR I MY GRATITUDE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST IS RETURNED HE
HIS VOYAGE WAS TEDIOUS
HE HEARD THE CRIES OF A WOMAN IN DISTRESS AND FOLLOWED THE SOUND TILL HE ARRIVED AT A CHAISE IN WAITING AND SAW MATILDA PLACED IN IT BY THE SIDE OF TWO MEN WHO PRESENTED PISTOLS TO HIM AS HE OFFERED TO APPROACH AND EXPOSTULATE
IT IS ON LADY MATILDA'S ACCOUNT YOU HATE ME AND USE ME THUS SANDFORD PUT DOWN THE BOOK HASTILY AND PUT BOTH HIS HANDS BY HIS SIDE
I PROTEST I SAID NOTHING NOTHING
LORD ELMWOOD AT THAT NAME MATILDA STARTED AND CRIED WHERE IS HE
SHOULD I HAVE FELT THE SAME AFFECTION FOR HER HAD SHE BEEN THE CHILD OF OTHER PARENTS
SANDFORD OBSERVED IT AND WAS ALL HUMBLENESS BOTH IN HIS WORDS AND LOOKS IN ORDER TO SOFTEN HIM
AFTER AN ALTERATION IN MY TEETH AND THE DEATH OF DR WARREN--YET FAR FROM UNHAPPY
AND THE SUSPICIONS OF HER GUARDIAN BEING NOW CHANGED TO THE LIBERAL CONFIDENCE OF A DOATING LOVER SHE AGAIN PROFESSED ALL HER FORMER FOLLIES ALL HER FASHIONABLE LEVITIES AND INDULGED THEM WITH LESS RESTRAINT THAN EVER
YOU PROMISED TO HEAR ME MY LORD CRIED RUSHBROOK AND I CLAIM YOUR PROMISE HE NOW SUDDENLY OVERCAME HIS VIOLENCE OF PASSION AND STOOD SILENT AND RESIGNED TO HEAR HIM
HER GUARDIAN MADE AN APOLOGY TO MISS MILNER FOR THE FORM THE CEREMONY OF WHICH HE WAS GOING TO MAKE USE
AND AMONG THE REST VENERATED THOSE OF HIS RELIGION
AT LAST HER IMPATIENT EYE CAUGHT THE WORD THREE LINES BEYOND THE PLACE SHE WAS READING--IRRESISTIBLY SHE SKIPPED OVER THOSE LINES AND FIXED ON THE POINT TO WHICH SHE WAS ATTRACTED
FRANKNESS MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY
YET EVEN THERE HOW MUCH NOW WOULD SHE FIND TO RECOGNIZE
IN THE MORNING SHE FOUND HER FATHER BY THE SIDE OF HER BED
A SILENCE ENSUED
NO NEW MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED I HOPE CRIED RUSHBROOK
UPON THESE PRINCIPLES HE FORMED THE UNSHAKEN RESOLUTION NEVER TO ACKNOWLEDGE LADY MATILDA AS HIS CHILD--OR ACKNOWLEDGING HER AS SUCH--NEVER TO SEE TO HEAR OF OR TAKE ONE CONCERN WHATEVER IN HER FATE AND FORTUNE
I READ NO SUCH THINGS REPLIED SANDFORD AND QUITTED THE ROOM ABRUPTLY
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE LOVES HER NO ANSWERED MISS MILNER
AND WITH ALL HER INVENTION ALIVE ON THE SUBJECT THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ONLY NATURAL ONE THAT SHE COULD FORM
FOR WHERE HE AND I ARE THERE MUST BE CONTENTION I BROUGHT HIM HITHER MADAM OR I SHOULD RATHER SAY BROUGHT YOU TO THIS HOUSE MERELY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRESENT ON THIS OCCASION AND WITH HIS DISCERNMENT RELIEVE ME FROM A SUSPICION THAT MY OWN JUDGMENT IS NEITHER ABLE TO SUPPRESS NOR TO CONFIRM ARE THERE ANY MORE WITNESSES YOU MAY WISH TO CALL IN SIR TO REMOVE YOUR DOUBTS OF MY VERACITY
AND UPON THE DEPARTURE OF SANDFORD HE BEGAN TO BE UNUSUALLY CHEERFUL
MISS MILNER I GIVE YOU I FEAR SOME UNKIND PROOFS OF MY REGARD
THAT IS LADY MATILDA'S BELL SAID MISS WOODLEY
PROFESSIONS I FIND HAVE NO WEIGHT AND ONLY BY THIS OBEDIENCE TO YOUR ORDERS CAN I GIVE A PROOF OF THAT RESPECT WHICH YOU INSPIRE;--AND LET THE AGITATION I NOW FEEL CONVINCE YOU LADY MATILDA THAT WITH ALL MY SEEMING GOOD FORTUNE I AM NOT HAPPIER THAN YOURSELF AND SO MUCH WAS HE AGITATED WHILE HE DELIVERED THIS THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
TO THIS THEN LADY MATILDA WAS CONVEYED--A SUPERB APARTMENT ALLOTTED HER--AND ONE OF HIS CONFIDENTIAL FEMALES PLACED TO ATTEND UPON HER WITH ALL RESPECT AND ASSURANCES OF SAFETY
NOR DID HE NOR PERHAPS COULD HE CONCEAL WHAT HE FELT ALTHOUGH HIS SEVERE OBSERVER MR SANDFORD WAS PRESENT
YOU ARE BOTH IN LEAGUE EXCLAIMED LORD ELMWOOD
DID YOU TELL HER WHAT I LATELY DECLARED TO YOU HE ASKED WITH STILL MORE DIFFIDENCE
YOU SHALL FIND I'LL PERFORM IT.--DO
AND HE DID NOT PERFECTLY RECOVER HIMSELF TILL HE SAW TEARS POURING DOWN HER FACE
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SAID HIS UNCLE WITH A FROWN
MR DORRIFORTH WAS NEARLY RELATED TO ONE OF OUR FIRST CATHOLIC PEERS
NOR CAN IT BE A HARDSHIP TO OBEY THIS COMMAND--SHE CANNOT LAMENT THE SEPARATION FROM A PARENT WHOM SHE NEVER KNEW SANDFORD WAS GOING EAGERLY TO PROVE THE ERROR OF THAT ASSERTION BUT HE PREVENTED HIM SAYING IN A WORD--WITHOUT FARTHER ARGUMENT--IF SHE OBEYS ME IN THIS I WILL PROVIDE FOR HER AS MY DAUGHTER DURING MY LIFE AND LEAVE HER A FORTUNE AT MY DEATH--BUT IF SHE DARES SANDFORD INTERRUPTED THE MENACE PREPARED FOR UTTERANCE SAYING AND YOU STILL MEAN I SUPPOSE TO MAKE MR RUSHBROOK YOUR HEIR HAVE YOU NOT HEARD ME SAY SO
ON WHICH HE RESUMED
WHAT THESE TWO POWERFUL PRINCIPLES BROUGHT ABOUT THE READER WILL JUDGE WHEN HE PERUSES THE FOLLOWING LETTER RECEIVED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING BY MISS WOODLEY
THIS ADVICE WAS RECEIVED WITH DELIGHT AND A LETTER WAS SENT TO MR SANDFORD TO PREPARE FOR MR RUSHBROOK'S ARRIVAL
AND AWED BY HER MANNERS THE FAITHFUL FRIEND OF HER DECEASED MOTHER EXCLAIMED DEAR LADY MATILDA THINK NO MORE ON WHAT I HAVE DONE--DO NOT RESENT IT ANY LONGER AND ON MY KNEES I'LL BEG YOUR PARDON MISS WOODLEY ROSE AS SHE UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS
THE DANGER IN WHICH LORD ELMWOOD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WAS BUT OF SHORT DURATION AND HIS SUDDEN RECOVERY SUCCEEDED
SHE THEN ASKED WHY DID I NOT KEEP HIM LONGER IN SUSPENSE
SANDFORD SATISFIED THAT HE HAD JUDGED RIGHTLY AND YET UNWILLING TO BE TOO HARD UPON A PASSION WHICH HE READILY BELIEVED MUST HAVE HAD MANY NOBLE VIRTUES FOR ITS FOUNDATION NOW GOT UP AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD IN CENSURE THOUGH NOT A WORD IN APPROBATION
SOME COLD DISHES WERE NOW BROUGHT UP FOR SUPPER--MISS MILNER LOST HER DEAL AND THE GAME ENDED
THE WIDOW'S VOW
AND YET HOW COULD HE SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT HIS VISIT HAD PLACED THE DAUGHTER OF HIS BENEFACTOR AS A DEPENDENT STRANGER IN THAT HOUSE WHERE IN REALITY HE WAS THE DEPENDENT AND SHE THE LAWFUL HEIR
BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE VIRTUES IN WHICH SHE WAS THE LEAST PRACTISED
OR WOULD YOU FORCE MR DORRIFORTH I MEAN LORD ELMWOOD TO ANOTHER DUEL WITH MY LORD FREDERICK NO CALL HIM DORRIFORTH ANSWERED SHE WITH THE TEARS STEALING FROM HER EYES
HER KNIFE AND FORK GAVE A SUDDEN SPRING IN HER HAND BUT NO OTHER EMOTION WITNESSED WHAT SHE FELT
THE MORE YOU SLIGHT MY ADVICE THE MORE YOU WANT IT
HE FIRST SPOKE WARMLY IN HIS PRAISE THEN PLAINLY SAID THAT HE BELIEVED SHE POSSESSED THE POWER OF MAKING SO DESERVING A MAN HAPPY TO THE SUMMIT OF HIS WISHES
MUCH LESS BY ONE SO NEAR TO HER AS HER CHILD
THE NEXT DAY TOO AND THE DAY AFTER
HE THEN SET OFF AGAIN FOR THE SEAT HE HAD LEFT
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE REAL TENDERNESS WHICH HE BORE TO THE DAUGHTER OF HIS BENEFACTOR HE WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE COMFORT OF FINDING HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE POSSESSION OF ALL THOSE ENJOYMENTS HE HAD FORFEITED AND FOR A MOMENT LOST
OR IF THEY WERE A LITTLE TIME IN SUSPENCE MISS WOODLEY SOON ARRIVED AT THE CERTAINTY BY INQUIRING OF MR SANDFORD
OR BURSTING WITH RESENTMENT THOUGHT THIS THE MOMENT TO RETALIATE
A REASON I CANNOT GIVE TO LORD ELMWOOD THEN DO NOT GIVE IT TO ME FOR I HAVE PROMISED TO TELL HIM EVERY THING YOU SAY TO ME AND EVERY THING I HAVE SAID ASKED RUSHBROOK HASTILY
AND WHILE WITH APPARENT SATISFACTION SHE ADJUSTED THE PLAN OF HER JOURNEY LIKE THOSE WHO BEHAVE WELL NOT SO MUCH TO PLEASE THEMSELVES AS TO VEX THEIR ENEMIES SHE SECRETLY TRIUMPHED IN THE MORTIFICATION SHE HOPED THAT MR SANDFORD WOULD RECEIVE FROM HER OBEDIENT BEHAVIOUR
PERSONAL RESENTMENT WAS THEREFORE THE CONSTRUCTION HE PUT UPON LORD ELMWOOD'S EMOTION ON ENTERING THE ROOM
THUS ALL PASSED ON AS PEACEABLY AS HE HAD REQUESTED AND MISS MILNER HAD NOT BETRAYED ONE PARTICLE OF FRAILTY
BUT THERE HE WAS DECEIVED--THE LIE ONCE TOLD WAS AS TROUBLESOME AS IN THE CONCEPTION AND ADDED ANOTHER CONFUSION TO THE FIRST
NO MADAM REPLIED HE WITH CONFUSION NOT UNLESS LADY MATILDA GIVES ME PERMISSION SHE SMILED AND POINTED TO A CHAIR--AND ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH RUSHBROOK DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD RECEIVED FROM LORD ELMWOOD NEVER INSPIRED HALF THE GRATITUDE WHICH THIS ONE INSTANCE OF CIVILITY FROM HIS DAUGHTER EXCITED
HEATED HIS DRESS AND HIS HAIR DISORDERED HE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM JUST AS THE DESSERT WAS PUT UPON THE TABLE
SIR EDWARD ASHTON ABOUT THIS TIME ALSO SUBMITTED TO A FORMAL DISMISSION
YET FROM SOME VOLATILE THOUGHT OR SOME QUICK SENSE OF FEELING WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SUBDUE SHE WAS PERPETUALLY ON THE VERGE OF TREATING HIM WITH LEVITY
I CANNOT HELP THINKING BUT IT MUST BE YOUR EXPECTATION OF LORD ELMWOOD WHICH HAS OCCASIONED THIS CHANGE I DON'T KNOW REPLIED SANDFORD CARELESSLY BUT I BELIEVE I AM GROWN AFRAID OF YOUR FATHER
SIX WEEKS HAVE NOW ELAPSED SINCE MISS MILNER HAS BEEN IN LONDON PARTAKING WITH DELIGHT ALL ITS PLEASURES WHILE DORRIFORTH HAS BEEN SIGHING WITH APPREHENSION ATTENDING TO HER WITH PRECAUTION AND PRAYING WITH ZEALOUS FERVOUR FOR HER SAFETY
BUT IF WE ARE CONSPICUOUS ONLY FOR OUR VICE AND FOLLY HAD WE NOT BETTER REMAIN IN POVERTY YOU ARE BENEATH MY NOTICE I TRUST I SHALL CONTINUE SO--AND THAT YOUR LORDSHIP WILL NEVER AGAIN CONDESCEND TO COME WHERE I AM A MAN OF RANK CONDESCENDS TO MIX WITH ANY SOCIETY WHEN A PRETTY WOMAN IS THE OBJECT MY LORD I HAVE A BOOK HERE IN MY POCKET WHICH I AM EAGER TO READ
AND IF HE AND HIS SISTER WILL GO AND YOU WILL ALLOW THEM PART OF YOUR BOX I WILL PROMISE TO COME THIS WAS A CONDITION BY NO MEANS ACCEPTABLE TO HER
MOST WILLINGLY--WAS IT IN MY GIFT IT IS REPLIED HE
FOR HE WAS AS YET A STRANGER NOT ONLY TO THE REAL PROPENSITIES OF HER MIND BUT EVEN TO HER PERSON
TO WHICH AS HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER HE PREVAILED UPON HIS UNCLE WITH WHOM HE RESIDED TO WAIT UPON HER AND OBTAIN A VERBAL REPLY
DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT HIS MARRIAGE IS THE RESULT OF LOVE--IT IS NO MORE THAN A DUTY A NECESSARY ARRANGEMENT AND THIS YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE BY THE WIFE ON WHOM HE HAS FIXED
BUT THOUGH DORRIFORTH MAINTAINED HE WOULD NEVER SEE HIM
AND WHEN HIS VISITS WERE REFUSED HE THREATENED THIS
YET AS THERE WAS NO CAUSE OF INVETERATE RANCOUR ADMIRING HIM TOO AS A MAN WHO MEANT WELL AND BEING BESIDES OF A MOST FORGIVING TEMPER SHE FREQUENTLY FELT CONCERNED THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO HER ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN TO FIND FAULT AS USUAL--AND ONE MORNING AS THEY WERE ALL AFTER A LONG RAMBLE DRAWING TOWARDS HER HOUSE WHERE LORD ELMWOOD WAS INVITED TO DINE SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN DROPPING A TEAR AT SEEING SANDFORD TURN BACK AND WISH THEM A GOOD DAY BUT THOUGH SHE HAD THE GENEROSITY TO FORGIVE AN AFFRONT SHE HAD NOT THE HUMILITY TO MAKE A CONCESSION
IT APPEARED ON EVERY FEATURE EXCEPT HIS LIPS
AND I AM SURE IT WILL BE TO THE YOUNG LADY'S ADVANTAGE IS MISS MILNER TALL OR SHORT ASKED MRS HORTON STILL WISHING FOR FARTHER INFORMATION
BUT UNLUCKILY DORRIFORTH SAID SOON AFTER TO THE CHILD AND NOW TELL ME YOUR NAME HARRY RUSHBROOK REPLIED HE WITH FORCE AND CLEARNESS OF VOICE
THE STEPS APPROACHED QUICKER AND BEFORE SHE COULD RETREAT SHE BEHELD LORD ELMWOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL AND PERCEIVED THAT HE SAW HER
PERHAPS--NOT EVEN READ HER LETTER YES HE HAS READ IT RETURNED SANDFORD
LORD ELMWOOD AND SANDFORD ENTERED
HE HAD NOW A WEEK TO CALL HIS THOUGHTS TOGETHER TO WEIGH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER IMPLICITLY TO SUBMIT TO LORD ELMWOOD'S RECOMMENDATION OF A WIFE OR TO REVOLT FROM IT AND SEE ANOTHER WITH MORE SUBSERVIENCY TO HIS WILL APPOINTED HIS HEIR
LORD ELMWOOD WAS AT HOME BUT HE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED HER NAME
AND YET IF THIS WAS SO THE BORROWING WAS OF THE SLIGHTEST FOR IT IS ONLY IN THE FACT THAT SHE IS IMPERFECT THAT MISS MILNER BEARS TO MANON ANY RESEMBLANCE AT ALL
THE LAW SHALL BE YOUR ONLY ANTAGONIST MATILDA QUITE EXHAUSTED YET UPHELD BY THE SUDDEN TRANSPORT SHE HAD FELT WAS LED BY HER FATHER OUT OF THIS WRETCHED DWELLING--MORE DESPICABLE THAN THE BEGGAR'S HOVEL
A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MISS WOODLEY IN ORDER TO DIVERT THE DISCONSOLATE MIND OF LADY MATILDA AND IN THE HOPE OF BRINGING HER SOME LITTLE ANECDOTES TO CONSOLE HER FOR THAT WHICH HAD GIVEN HER SO MUCH PAIN WAITED UPON LORD ELMWOOD IN HIS LIBRARY AND BORROWED SOME BOOKS OUT OF IT
THE ANXIETY THE FIRMNESS DISCOVERED IN DETERMINING ON THIS UNDERSTANDING SOMEWHAT ALLEVIATED THE AGONY MISS WOODLEY ENDURED AND SHE BEGAN TO HOPE TIMELY ASSISTANCE MIGHT YET BE GIVEN TO HER BELOVED CHARGE
AND HER BLUSHES INCREASED
NO REPLIED MISS WOODLEY NOT FOR THE WORLD IF YOU WILL SEPARATE FROM HIM BY ANY MODE OF YOUR OWN--BUT THAT YOU SHALL SEPARATE IS MY DETERMINATION
HE COULD NOT HAVE LOVED ME MORE I BELIEVE
OF THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD PRETENDED TO LOVE SO PASSIONATELY--EVEN SMILES OF RAPTURE WERE UPON HER FACE THOUGH DORRIFORTH MIGHT BE RETURNED FROM PUTTING HIM TO DEATH
FOR THE PEER HIGHLY INCENSED AT HIS MISTRESS'S REPUGNANCE TO HIM DETERMINED MORE FIRMLY THAN EVER TO CONSULT HIS OWN HAPPINESS ALONE
THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE FULL OF HAZARD AND ADVENTURE BUT THE DETAILS OF THEM ARE UNCERTAIN
BUT ALTHOUGH SHE ACTED THIS CHARACTER WELL--SO WELL THAT EVERY ONE BUT MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT HER IN EARNEST--YET WITH NICE AND ATTENTIVE ANXIETY SHE WATCHED EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT REVIVE HER HOPES OR CONFIRM HER DESPAIR
YOU HAVE NOT PASSED YOUR CHRISTMAS HERE THESE MANY YEARS NO RETURNED YOUR FATHER
MR SANDFORD WAS NOW THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM SHE COULD SPEAK OF MISS MILNER AND THE DELIGHT HE TOOK TO EXPATIATE ON HER FAULTS WAS MORE SORROW TO HER FRIEND THAN NOT TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL
AND WHILE YOU SIR SHE CONTINUED ARE SO INDULGENT AS NOT TO DISTRESS ME WITH THE IMPORTUNITIES OF ANY GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I AM AVERSE I THINK MYSELF EQUALLY BOUND TO RID YOU OF THE IMPERTINENCE OF EVERY ONE TO WHOM YOU MAY HAVE OBJECTION BUT ANSWERED HE REST ASSURED I HAVE NO MATERIAL OBJECTION TO MY LORD FREDERICK EXCEPT FROM THAT DILEMMA IN WHICH YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM HAS INVOLVED US ALL
NAY RETURNED SHE IT IS I HAVE NO DOUBT A LETTER TO BEG MY PARDON BUT HER RELUCTANCE TO OPEN IT PLAINLY EVINCED SHE DID NOT THINK SO
BUT MISS MILNER YOU NEED NOT HAVE HAD ANY APPREHENSIONS OF MY COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY FOR I UNDERSTAND THE SEAT TO WHICH YOUR GUARDIAN MEANS TO GO BELONGS TO YOU
WHEN THE RING WAS WANTING LORD ELMWOOD SUPPLIED IT WITH ONE FROM HIS OWN HAND BUT THROUGHOUT ALL THE REST OF THE CEREMONY APPEARED LOST IN ZEALOUS DEVOTION TO HEAVEN
YOU HAVE EAT NOTHING TO-DAY WITH FEELINGS OF HUMANITY AND APPARENTLY NO OTHER SENSATION--BUT NEVER DID HE FEEL HIS PHILANTHROPY SO FORCIBLE--LORD ELMWOOD SAID LET ME BEG OF YOU MISS MILNER TO HAVE SOMETHING PROVIDED FOR YOU THE EARNESTNESS AND EMPHASIS WITH WHICH THESE FEW WORDS WERE PRONOUNCED WERE MORE FLATTERING THAN THE FINEST TURNED COMPLIMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THERE ARE NO OBJECTS UNWORTHY OUR CARE REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD
HE HAS REPLIED SANDFORD,--"BUT BUT WHAT SIR CRIED LORD ELMWOOD
AND AS SOON AS THE SHOCK HE RECEIVED FROM LADY ELMWOOD'S CONDUCT WAS ABATED AN ENTIRE CALMNESS AND RESIGNATION ENSUED
WE LEFT LADY ELMWOOD IN THE LAST VOLUME AT THE SUMMIT OF HUMAN HAPPINESS
SOME OF THE COMPANY STAID SUPPER WHICH PREVENTED THE EMBARRASSMENT THAT MUST UNAVOIDABLY HAVE ARISEN HAD THE FAMILY BEEN BY THEMSELVES
BUT HER APPEARANCE GAVE AN INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE TO HIS WHOLE MIND AND COUNTENANCE
SHE HAD A QUICK SENSIBILITY WHICH TOO FREQUENTLY DISCOVERED ITSELF IN THE IMMEDIATE RESENTMENT OF INJURIES OR NEGLECT
SURPRISED AT THE SIGHT OF MR SANDFORD IN HER HOUSE MISS MILNER WOULD NOT EXPRESS THAT SURPRISE BUT GOING UP TO HIM WITH ALL THE FRIENDLY BENEVOLENCE WHICH IN GENERAL PLAYED ABOUT HER HEART SHE TOOK HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS AND PRESSED IT WITH A KINDNESS WHICH TOLD HIM MORE FORCIBLY THAT HE WAS WELCOME THAN IF SHE HAD MADE THE MOST ELABORATE SPEECH TO CONVINCE HIM OF IT
BUT ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY TAKING A LONELY WALK HE TURNED THE CORNER OF A GROVE AND SAW IN THE VERY PATH HE WAS GOING SANDFORD ACCOMPANIED BY MISS WOODLEY
HE TURNED TO SANDFORD--THEN PLACING HER BY HIS OWN SIDE AS THE FORM OF MATRIMONY REQUIRES GAVE THIS FOR A SIGN TO SANDFORD THAT HE SHOULD BEGIN THE CEREMONY
ANIMATED ELEGANT EXTREMELY HANDSOME AND POSSESSED OF EVERY ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WOULD CAPTIVATE A HEART LESS SUSCEPTIBLE OF LOVE THAN MISS MILNER'S WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING IMBIBED AN AVERSION TO MATRIMONY HE HEARD WITH BUT LITTLE REGRET THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF HER EVER BECOMING HER FATHER'S HEIR WHILE SUCH AN INFORMATION GAVE HIM THE HOPE OF OBTAINING HER UPON THE TERMS OF A MISTRESS
THE JURY CONSULTED FOR A FEW MINUTES
WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF THE STUDY SHE OPENED IT WITH A TREPIDATION SHE COULD HARDLY ACCOUNT FOR AND ENTERED TO DORRIFORTH THE ALTERED WOMAN SHE HAS BEEN REPRESENTED
WHILE LADY MATILDA WHO WAS ARRANGING HER MUSIC BOOKS UPON THE INSTRUMENT STOPPED FROM HER EMPLOYMENT SUDDENLY WITH HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
AFTER HE HAD INFORMED MRS HORTON AND MR SANDFORD WHO WERE SITTING TOGETHER OF THE CAUSE OF HIS SUDDEN RETURN AND HAD SUPPER ORDERED FOR HIM HE ENQUIRED WHAT COMPANY HAD JUST LEFT THE HOUSE WE HAVE BEEN ALONE THE WHOLE EVENING MY LORD REPLIED MRS HORTON
HER GUARDIAN SEEING HER NEAR FAINTING AND WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM HER FRIEND WAS GOING HIMSELF TO GIVE IT
HIS LORDSHIP NOW ARRIVES IN THE COUNTRY AND CALLS ONE MORNING AT MISS MILNER'S
FOR MATILDA WITH AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING A SEDATENESS ABOVE HER YEARS AND EARLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE MOST PRIVATE CONVERSE BETWEEN LADY ELMWOOD AND MISS WOODLEY WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE FATAL HISTORY OF HER MOTHER
FOR HE SEEMED TO DREAD SEEING LADY ELMWOOD'S HANDWRITING
WHILE YOU CONTINUE UNMARRIED IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN YOUR FATHER'S INTENTION THAT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE UNDER MY IMMEDIATE CARE
HOW DO YOU DO SANDFORD SAID LORD ELMWOOD WITH EXTREME KINDNESS
MR SANDFORD RESUMED LORD ELMWOOD WITH A VOICE AND MANNER SUCH AS HE USED TO PUT ON WHEN NOT ALL THE POWER OF SANDFORD OR OF ANY OTHER COULD CHANGE HIS FIXED DETERMINATION MR SANDFORD MY EYES ARE NOW OPEN TO EVERY FAILING AS WELL AS TO EVERY ACCOMPLISHMENT
CHAPTER XIII
CHAPTER XIII
AND NOW--LEAVING DESCRIPTION--THE READER MUST FORM A JUDGMENT OF HER BY HER ACTIONS
AND THOUGH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT SHE WAS FULL OF APPREHENSIONS
YES SHE REPLIED I HAVE SEEN HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES THE EARL HOPING THE AIR MIGHT BE A MEANS OF RE-ESTABLISHING HER STRENGTH AND SPIRITS NOW LEFT THE ROOM AND ORDERED HIS CARRIAGE TO BE PREPARED
YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
AND UPON YOU THEIR SITUATION THE CARE THE WHOLE MANAGEMENT OF THEM DEPENDS--BUT BE SURE YOU NEVER LET THEM BE NAMED BEFORE ME FROM THIS MOMENT THEN SAID SANDFORD AS THIS MUST BE THE LAST TIME THEY ARE MENTIONED I MUST NOW TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISBURDEN MY MIND OF A CHARGE WHAT CHARGE CRIED LORD ELMWOOD MOROSELY INTERRUPTING HIM
A SECOND EDITION WAS PRINTED IMMEDIATELY AND SEVERAL MORE FOLLOWED
YET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT THAT SO FAR AS QUALITY ALONE IS CONCERNED EVELINA DESERVES TO BE RANKED CONSIDERABLY BELOW A SIMPLE STORY BUT ITS WRITER WAS THE FAMILIAR FRIEND OF THE GREATEST SPIRITS OF HER AGE
THIS SEEMING STRUGGLE WITH HER PASSION ENDEARED HER MORE THAN EVER TO MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WOULD EVEN RISK THE DISPLEASURE OF DORRIFORTH BY HER COMPLIANCE WITH EVERY NEW PURSUIT THAT MIGHT AMUSE THE TIME WHICH ELSE HER FRIEND PASSED IN HEAVINESS OF HEART
BUT AT LENGTH EVERY VIRTUOUS AND PIOUS SENTIMENT THIS MEDITATION INSPIRED SERVED BUT TO REMIND HER OF THE MANY SENTENCES SHE HAD HEARD FROM HER GUARDIAN'S LIPS UPON THE SAME SUBJECT--HER THOUGHTS WERE AGAIN FIXED ON HIM AND SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES
TAKE CARE OF HER THIS INTERRUPTION WAS TORTURE TO RUSHBROOK WHO KEPT CLOSE TO HIS SIDE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A FURTHER EXPLANATION
LADY ELMWOOD HAS PETITIONED ME IN THE NAME OF HER FATHER A NAME I REVERENCE TO GIVE HIS GRANDCHILD THE SANCTION OF MY PROTECTION
AND PERHAPS IN TIME MAKE GOOD BY CHOICE RATHER THAN BY CONSTRAINT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS DYING FRIEND'S SOLE CARE DORRIFORTH WHO CAME POST FROM LONDON TO VISIT MR MILNER IN HIS ILLNESS RECEIVED A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE HIS DEATH ALL HIS INJUNCTIONS AND PROMISED TO FULFIL THEM
BUT THE SENSIBILITY OF MISS MILNER HAD NOW REVERSED THAT PROSPECT INTO PERPETUAL SPRING
AND HER GUARDIAN ACCOMPANIED BY MISS WOODLEY WENT IN HIS CARRIAGE TO MEET HER AND WAITED AT AN INN ON THE ROAD FOR HER RECEPTION
BUT THOSE APPROACHES TO WHAT WAS ESTIMABLE WERE IN THEIR FIRST IMPULSE TOO FREQUENTLY MET AND INTERCEPTED BY SOME DARLING FOLLY
MISS FENTON YOUNG OF EXQUISITE BEAUTY ELEGANT MANNERS GENTLE DISPOSITION AND DISCREET CONDUCT WAS INTRODUCED TO MISS MILNER'S ACQUAINTANCE BY HER GUARDIAN AND FREQUENTLY SOMETIMES INADVERTENTLY HELD UP BY HIM AS A PATTERN FOR HER TO FOLLOW--FOR WHEN HE DID NOT SAY THIS IN DIRECT TERMS IT WAS INSINUATED BY THE WARMTH OF HIS PANEGYRIC ON THOSE VIRTUES IN WHICH MISS FENTON EXCELLED AND IN WHICH HIS WARD WAS OBVIOUSLY DEFICIENT
THE WOMAN HAD RECEIVED NO ORDERS TO CONCEAL WHERE THE LADIES WERE GONE AND YET A SECRET INFLUENCE WHICH GOVERNS THE THOUGHTS OF ALL WAITING-WOMEN AND CHAMBERMAIDS WHISPERED TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO TELL THE TRUTH
WHEN SANDFORD AND THE LADIES LEFT THE NORTH AND CAME TO ELMWOOD HOUSE SO MUCH WERE THEIR THOUGHTS EMPLOYED WITH OTHER IDEAS THAT LORD MARGRAVE DID NOT OCCUPY A PLACE
MISS WOODLEY CLASPED HER FRIEND IN HER ARMS AND CRIED WITH THE TENDEREST AFFECTION AND PITY MY DEAR MISS MILNER BE COMPOSED MISS MILNER SAT DOWN AND WAS SO FOR A MINUTE
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE MAN NOTHING MY LORD REPLIED HE BUT I AM AFRAID I AM GOING TO OFFEND YOU WELL NO MATTER HE ANSWERED CARELESSLY ONLY GO ON AND LET ME KNOW YOUR BUSINESS THE MAN'S DISTRESS INCREASED--AND HE CRIED IN A VOICE OF GRIEF AND AFFRIGHT--"YOUR CHILD MY LORD RUSHBROOK AND SANDFORD STARTED
I WILL GO AWAY FROM HIM DIRECTLY--BUT LET US PART IN FRIENDSHIP--OH
TO ANSWER WHICH WAS THE SOLE EMPLOYMENT OF A SERVANT WHO WAS PLACED THERE DURING THE EARL'S RESIDENCE LEST BY ANY ACCIDENT HE MIGHT CHANCE TO COME NEAR THAT UNFREQUENTED PART OF THE HOUSE ON WHICH OCCASION THE MAN WAS TO GIVE IMMEDIATE NOTICE TO HIS LADY
BUT AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH MODESTY AND DIGNITY IN THE PERSON OF MATILDA THE APPEARANCE OF SO MUCH GOOD WILL AND YET SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION IN HER COMPANION
I SAW HIM THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED DIVINELY--I LONGED TO SPEAK TO HIM MISS WOODLEY CAST BY STEALTH AN EYE OF APPREHENSION UPON LORD ELMWOOD'S FACE AND TREMBLED AT SEEING IT FLUSHED WITH RESENTMENT
BUT THIS KIND OF BARBARISM DID NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF AN ALMOST CHILDISH GAIETY
A CONSTANT ROUND OF VISITS HAVING PREVENTED HIS MEETING HER AT HER FATHER'S THE VERY FEW TIMES HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE SINCE HER FINAL RETURN FROM SCHOOL
NOT ONLY HER COLOUR BUT HER FEATURES BECAME CHANGED
DID I NOT LOVE LADY MATILDA BEFORE I BEHELD HER?--FOR HER MOTHER'S SAKE I LOVED HER--AND EVEN FOR HER FATHER'S
WHEN HE HAD QUITTED THE ROOM WHERE MISS WOODLEY WAS RUSHBROOK TIMID BEFORE HER AS SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE HER BENEFACTOR WENT UP TO HER ALL HUMILITY AND SAID MISS WOODLEY WE OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS
AT LORD ELMWOOD'S HE MET SANDFORD IN THE HALL AND THE SIGHT OF HIM WAS NO LONGER WELCOME--HE KNEW HOW DIFFERENT THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD JUST ADOPTED WERE TO THOSE OF THAT REVEREND FRIEND AND WITHOUT HIS COMPLAINING OR EVEN SUSPECTING WHAT HAD HAPPENED HIS PRESENCE WAS A SUFFICIENT REPROACH
THEY WERE ALL DISAPPOINTED--HE DID NOT UTTER A SYLLABLE
THE MAN SET OUT MEANING AT ALL EVENTS TO ATTEMPT HER RELEASE
BEFORE HER IT WAS SANDFORD'S MEANING TO HAVE CONCEALED HIS THOUGHTS UPON THE SUBJECT AND NEVER TO HAVE MENTIONED IT BUT WITH COMPOSURE
THEN I HAVE ONLY LOST A MAN WHO HAD NO REGARD FOR ME HE MAY HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU NOTWITHSTANDING BUT FOR THE LOVE I HAVE FELT AND DO STILL FEEL FOR MY LORD ELMWOOD I WILL HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN A GREAT REGARD IN RETURN YOU HAVE HIS LOVE I AM SURE BUT IS IT SUCH AS MINE
IT IS NOT IN YOUR POWER TO BESTOW BUT HE HAS TOLD ME IT SHALL BE IN MY POWER
UNUSED AT ANY TIME TO RESIST TEMPTATIONS WHETHER TO REPREHENSIBLE OR TO LAUDABLE ACTIONS SHE YIELDED TO HIS SUPPLICATIONS AND HAVING OVERCOME A FEW SCRUPLES OF MISS WOODLEY'S DETERMINED TO TAKE YOUNG RUSHBROOK TO TOWN AND PRESENT HIM TO HIS UNCLE
I AM INDIFFERENTLY WELL MY LORD REPLIED HE WITH A FACE OF DEEP CONCERN AND A TEAR IN HIS EYE PARTLY IN GRATITUDE FOR HIS PATRON'S CIVILITY AND PARTLY IN REPROACH FOR HIS CRUELTY
THE FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS I AM DOWN IN THE SUMMER SHE MAY EASILY IN THAT EXTENSIVE HOUSE AVOID ME--WHILE SHE DOES SHE LIVES IN SECURITY--WHEN SHE DOES NOT--YOU KNOW MY RESOLUTION SANDFORD BOWED--THE EARL RESUMED
ALONE OR TO HER FRIEND SHE SIGHS AND WEEPS
AND FOR FEAR ANY NOISE SHOULD INTERCEPT EVEN THE SOUND OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN SHE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM MORE SOFTLY THAN USUAL AND MORE SOFTLY TOUCHED EVERY THING SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LAY HER HAND ON
AND MRS HORTON AND MISS WOODLEY HAVING OPPORTUNELY BEGUN A DISCOURSE UPON SOME TRIVIAL OCCURRENCES GAVE HIM TIME TO RECOVER HIMSELF BY DEGREES--YET STILL IT WAS MERELY BY DEGREES
LORD ELMWOOD WAS ALL IMPATIENCE
HE RECOVERED
THE MIRACLE HAD BEEN IF SHE HAD NOT DONE SO--FOR DID SHE NOT YESTERDAY CONTRADICT WHAT SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE DAY BEFORE
THOUGH HER'S WERE SOFTENED BY SORROW WHILE HIS WERE MADE AUSTERE BY THE SELF-SAME CAUSE
WHILE THE HEART OF MISS MILNER OVERFLOWED WITH A GRATITUDE THAT GAVE PLACE TO NO SENTIMENT EXCEPT HER LOVE
WHO UNDERTAKE TO FIND HIM OUT
YOU FLATTER YOURSELF IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FRIEND LORD ELMWOOD THAT YOU REJOICE AND BECAUSE HE HAS ESCAPED A DANGER
AND IF YOU SHOULD NOT SUCCEED NOW AT LEAST FIX THE TIME YOU MEAN TO GO DURING THE AUTUMN AND BE FIRM TO YOUR DETERMINATION BUT IN THE AUTUMN REPLIED DORRIFORTH LORD FREDERICK WILL OF COURSE BE IN THE COUNTRY
BY MERE ACCIDENT MY LORD MISS WOODLEY REPLIED FOR THE CROWD WAS SO GREAT I THINK MY LORD SAID SANDFORD IT WAS VERY LUCKY THAT YOU WERE NOT THERE HAD LORD ELMWOOD BEEN WITH US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD OCCASION FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF ANY OTHER SAID MISS MILNER
DO NOT SUSPECT ME OF THAT WHILE MY HEART WAS ANOTHER'S
DO YOU DARE TO REPLY TO ME EQUIVOCALLY WHEN I HAVE ASKED A POSITIVE ANSWER PERHAPS I AM NOT POSITIVE MYSELF MY LORD
YET HER SENSES PERFECTLY CLEAR AND COLLECTED WHICH SERVED BUT TO SHARPEN THE ANGUISH OF DYING
I AM ON THE CONTRARY GOING TO RELEASE YOU FROM ANY SUCH APPREHENSION FOR THE FUTURE THOSE LAST THREE WORDS HE DELIVERED WITH A COUNTENANCE SO SERIOUS AND SO DETERMINED WITH AN ACCENT SO FIRM AND SO DECIDED THEY PIERCED THROUGH HER HEART
THE SUMMONS FROM LORD ELMWOOD FOR THEIR COMING TO TOWN WAS RECEIVED BY EACH OF THIS PARTY WITH DELIGHT
SHE HAD FELT SOMETHING LIKE AFFRIGHT BEFORE SHE SAW HIM
HAD YOU KNOWN MORE YOU WOULD HAVE JUDGED OTHERWISE I SUBMIT TO THE MERIT OF YOUR REPLY
BUT THIS THE FIRST CALL OF DISSIPATION WOULD CHANGE TO ILL-TIMED RAILLERY OR PEEVISH REMONSTRANCE AT BEING LIMITED IN DELIGHTS HER BIRTH AND FORTUNE ENTITLED HER TO ENJOY
THEN HE SPEAKS WITH SUCH EXQUISITE SENSIBILITY ON THE SUBJECT OF LOVE THAT HE COMMENDS THE VERY THING WHICH HE ATTEMPTS TO DEPRECIATE
THE WISHED-FOR CONSEQUENCE WAS PRODUCED--FOR THOUGH THERE WAS AN INSTINCTIVE RECTITUDE IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF MISS MILNER THAT WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HER WITHOUT OTHER INSTRUCTION WHAT MANNERS TO OBSERVE TOWARDS HER DEPUTED FATHER
NO WILL AT ALL RETURNED HE SURPRISED
MISS FENTON AND MISS WOODLEY ACCOMPANIED HER PART OF THE JOURNEY ABOUT THIRTY MILES WHERE THEY WERE MET BY SIR HARRY AND LADY LUNEHAM
COULD ANY THING BUT A SON HAVE PRESERVED MY TITLE THEN IT IS YET POSSIBLE BY MARRYING AGAIN YOU MEAN
AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT TIME WAS INSUFFICIENT AND HER FATHER NO LONGER TO BE DISSUADED FROM HIS INTENTION SHE SECRETLY SOLD SOME OF HER MOST VALUABLE ORNAMENTS TO SATISFY HIS DEMAND AND SCREEN US FROM ITS CONSEQUENCES DORRIFORTH PLEASED AT THIS RECITAL TOOK MRS HILLGRAVE BY THE HAND AND TOLD HER SHE SHOULD NEVER WANT A FRIEND IS MISS MILNER TALL OR SHORT AGAIN ASKED MRS HORTON FEARING FROM THE SUDDEN PAUSE WHICH HAD ENSUED THE SUBJECT SHOULD BE DROPPED
THIS WAS A WHOLE LENGTH PORTRAIT OF LORD ELMWOOD ESTEEMED A VERY CAPITAL PICTURE AND A PERFECT LIKENESS--TO THIS PICTURE SHE WOULD SIGH AND WEEP
THIS WAS A TRIUMPH SO AGREEABLE TO HER THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY PARDONED THE OFFENCE
ON HIS ENTERING THE ROOM SANDFORD BEHELD THE INQUIETUDE OF HIS MIND AND CRIED HERE IS YOUR GUARDIAN WITH A CRUEL EMPHASIS ON THE WORD
FLED FROM HIS HOUSE NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN TO A HABITATION WHERE HE WAS THE MASTER
FOR HE LOVED HER SINCERELY IF SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM--AND I WISH THEY HAD BEEN BURIED TOGETHER IT IS NOT THEN TOO LATE SAID SANDFORD AND WAS GOING ON--BUT THE OTHER INTERRUPTED HIM
AH MANUEL EXCLAIMS ONE OF HER HEROINES I AM NOW AMPLY PUNISHED BY THE MARQUIS FOR ALL MY CRUELTY TO DUKE CORDUNNA--HE TO WHOM MY FATHER IN MY INFANCY BETROTHED ME AND TO WHOM I WILLINGLY PLEDGED MY FAITH HOPING TO WED
THE MOMENT SHE WAS GONE MR SANDFORD ROSE NIMBLY FROM HIS SEAT RUBBED HIS HANDS WALKED BRISKLY ACROSS THE ROOM THEN ASKED LORD ELMWOOD IN A CHEERFUL TONE WHETHER HE DINED AT HOME TO-DAY THAT WHICH HAD GIVEN SANDFORD CHEERFULNESS HAD SO DEPRESSED LORD ELMWOOD THAT HE SAT DEJECTED AND SILENT
BUT IF IT CONSISTS IN SORROW THE YOUNG MAN GIVES A PROOF HE POSSESSES IT FOR HE SHED TEARS WHEN I LAST HEARD HIM MENTION YOUR NAME I HAVE MORE CAUSE TO WEEP AT THE MENTION OF HIS PERHAPS SO.--BUT LET ME TELL YOU LADY MATILDA THAT YOUR FATHER MIGHT HAVE PREFERRED A MORE UNWORTHY OBJECT STILL HAD HE BEEN TO ME SHE CRIED AN OBJECT OF ENVY
PREFACE
EXCEPT INDEED THE ORDER RECEIVED BY GIFFARD WHICH BEING GIVEN AFTER LORD ELMWOOD WAS IN HIS CARRIAGE AND IN CONCISE TERMS THE DOMESTICS WHO ATTENDED HIM AND FROM WHOM THIS MAN HAD GAINED HIS INTELLIGENCE WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH IT
MR RUSHBROOK IS MY RELATION SHE CRIED IN A PATHETIC VOICE MY COMPANION MY FRIEND--BEFORE YOU LOVED ME HE WAS ANXIOUS FOR MY HAPPINESS AND OFTEN VISITED ME TO LAMENT WITH AND CONSOLE ME
BUT IF A PARENT'S HEART IS VOID I WOULD HAVE IT REMAIN SO TILL ITS LAWFUL OWNER IS REPLACED--USURPERS I DETEST NO ONE CAN TAKE LORD ELMWOOD'S HEART BY FORCE REPLIED HIS DAUGHTER IT MUST I BELIEVE BE A FREE GIFT TO THE POSSESSOR
AND ALL HER CONSOLATION WAS SHE WOULD GO TO THE CHAMBER WINDOW THAT WAS FRONTING THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH HE WAS TO PASS TO HIS CARRIAGE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME AND MOST PROBABLY FOR THE LAST TIME IN HER LIFE BEHOLD HIM THIS DESIGN WAS SOON FORGOT IN ANOTHER:--"SHE WOULD RUSH BOLDLY INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE HE WAS AND AT HIS FEET TAKE LEAVE OF HIM FOR EVER--SHE WOULD LAY HOLD OF HIS HANDS CLASP HIS KNEES PROVOKE HIM TO SPURN HER WHICH WOULD BE JOY IN COMPARISON TO THIS CRUEL INDIFFERENCE IN THE BITTERNESS OF HER GRIEF SHE ONCE CALLED UPON HER MOTHER AND REPROACHED HER MEMORY--BUT THE MOMENT SHE RECOLLECTED THIS OFFENCE WHICH WAS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY SHE BECAME ALL MILDNESS AND RESIGNATION
FOR THE WORLD SHE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN WITH A SPRIGHTLY ACCENT
AND THERE BEING INFORMED IT WAS LADY MATILDA WHOM HE HAD BEHELD THIS INTELLIGENCE JOINED TO THE POWERFUL EFFECT HER SCREAMS HAD ON HIM MADE HIM RESOLVE TO TAKE HORSE IMMEDIATELY AND WITH SOME FRIENDS FOLLOW THE CARRIAGE TILL THEY SHOULD TRACE THE PLACE TO WHICH SHE WAS CONVEYED
THE FIRST PERSON SHE MET WOULD ENQUIRE WHY SHE HAD BEEN WEEPING
THE HEAVINESS WAS REMOVED FROM HER EYES BUT FEAR GRIEF AND SHAME SEIZED UPON HER HEART
STILL I DID NOT CALL TO MIND BUT SAID LADY ELMWOOD SIR WHILE YOU WERE ABROAD.'--AS SOON AS THESE WORDS WERE DELIVERED I SAW MY DOOM IN HIS LOOKS AND HE COMMANDED ME TO QUIT HIS HOUSE AND SERVICE THAT INSTANT I AM AFRAID SAID SANDFORD SHAKING HIS HEAD I CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU YES SIR YOU KNOW YOU HAVE MORE POWER OVER MY LORD THAN ANY BODY--AND PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SAVE ME AND ALL MINE FROM MISERY I WOULD IF I COULD REPLIED SANDFORD QUICKLY
HOW STRANGE IS THIS CRIED MATILDA WHEN MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE ALONE MY FATHER WITHIN A FEW ROOMS OF ME AND YET I AM DEBARRED FROM SEEING HIM
IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER
BUT TO AVOID THE TEMPTATION I WILL NEVER AGAIN COME INTO YOUR COMPANY UNLESS MY FRIEND LORD ELMWOOD BE PRESENT TO PROTECT ME AND HIS CHILD FROM YOUR INSULTS RUSHBROOK ROSE IN YET MORE WARMTH THAN SANDFORD HAVE YOU THE INJUSTICE TO SAY THAT I HAVE INSULTED LADY MATILDA TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL IS IN YOU AN INSULT
THAT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE--UNUSED TO HIDE HIS FEELINGS AT THE NAME OF RUSHBROOK HIS COUNTENANCE WOULD ALWAYS CHANGE AND A SARCASTIC SNEER SOMETIMES A FROWN OF RESENTMENT WOULD FORCE ITS WAY IN SPITE OF HIS RESOLUTION
THE MERITS OF A SIMPLE STORY ARE OF A KIND PECULIARLY CALCULATED TO ESCAPE THE NOTICE OF A GENERATION OF READERS BROUGHT UP ON THE FICTION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
AND HERE DO I VENTURE LIKE A MISSIONARY AMONG SAVAGES--BUT IF I CAN ONLY SAVE YOU FROM THEIR SCALPING KNIVES--FROM THE MISERIES WHICH THAT LADY IS PREPARING FOR YOU I AM REWARDED SANDFORD SPOKE THIS WITH GREAT FERVOUR AND THE OFFENCE OF HER LOVE NEVER APPEARED TO HER IN SO TREMENDOUS A POINT OF VIEW AS WHEN THUS UNKNOWINGLY ALLUDED TO BY HIM
MISS MILNER WITH ALL HER ASSUMED GAIETY AND REAL INSOLENCE HAD NOT HOWEVER THE INSOLENCE TO SEEM AS IF SHE OBSERVED HIM
SHE WEARIED OUT WITH THE TEDIOUS NIGHT'S DISSIPATION AND FAR LESS JOYOUS THAN MELANCHOLY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AS SHE RODE HOME AND CAME HALF ASLEEP OUT OF HER CARRIAGE
MY LORD HAS MET LADY MATILDA REPLIED THE MAN
I SHOULD EVER DEPLORE THE LOSS CRIED MISS MILNER
AND YOU MUST EXCUSE ANY WANT OF ETIQUETTE AT THIS HOUSE WHILE YOU EXCUSE ME MADAM WHAT CAN I HAVE TO COMPLAIN OF SHE APPEARED ABSENT WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING AND TURNING TO MISS WOODLEY SAID DO YOU THINK I HAD BETTER WALK TO-DAY NO MY DEAR ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY
BUT FROM THE ABODE OF RUSHBROOK SHE DERIVED PUNISHMENT ALONE
OLD OR UGLY
THE OECONOMY WHICH SHE HAD LEARNT IN HER EARLY DAYS SHE CONTINUED TO PRACTISE
BUT THE MAGIC WHICH ONCE ENCHANTED AWAY THIS SPIRIT OF IMMUTABILITY WAS NO MORE--LADY ELMWOOD WAS NO MORE AND THE CHARM WAS BROKEN
THEY HAD NOT LEFT THE HOUSE TWO MINUTES WHEN A THUNDERING RAP CAME AT THE DOOR--IT WAS LORD ELMWOOD IN A POST CHAISE
PERHAPS WERE I TO KNEEL TO HIM--KNEEL LIKE OTHER CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AND BEG HIS BLESSING HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT ME YOU MUST NOT TRY SAID SANDFORD MILDLY
AND WHAT ONE FORTUNATE THOUGHT MIGHT SOME TIME BRING ABOUT WAS AN OBJECT MUCH TOO SERIOUS FOR HER TO OVERLOOK
FOR SHE KNEW IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT WITH ALL HIS APPARENT INDIFFERENCE HE COULD EVER SEE HER WITHOUT THINKING FOR A MOMENT ON HIS CHILD
MISS FENTON WAS NOT ONLY A PERSON WHOSE AMIABLE QUALITIES HE ADMIRED BUT SHE WAS SOON TO BE ALLIED TO HIM BY HER MARRIAGE WITH HIS NEAREST RELATION LORD ELMWOOD A YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHOM HE SINCERELY LOVED
IN A LONELY COUNTRY ON THE BORDERS OF SCOTLAND A SINGLE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF A DREARY HEATH WAS THE RESIDENCE OF THE ONCE GAY VOLATILE MISS MILNER
SHE LONGED IMPATIENTLY FOR THE CURTAIN TO DROP BECAUSE SHE WAS UNEASY WHERE SHE WAS--YET SHE ASKED HERSELF SHALL I BE LESS UNHAPPY AT HOME
SHE DID NOT EAT WHAT SHE HAD SO POLITELY TAKEN BUT LAID IT DOWN SOON AFTER
WHAT ASTONISHMENT
SHE REPLIED NO AND BEAUTY CONTINUED SANDFORD WHEN ENDOWED UPON SPIRITS THAT ARE EVIL IS A MARK OF THEIR GREATER THEIR MORE EXTREME WICKEDNESS
WHATEVER PASSION REIGNED THAT INSTANT IT WAS FAVOURABLE TO THE DESIRES OF LORD FREDERICK AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM
SHE DOES NOT KNOW HERSELF WHAT COMPANY SHE IS IN REPLIED HE
YOU TALK INCONSIDERATELY--WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY PROOF I MEAN I WILL DO SOMETHING THAT NO PRUDENT MAN OUGHT TO FORGIVE
AND THIS YOU HAVE NOT DONE INADVERTENTLY
THE MIDNIGHT HOUR A COMEDY
AND MISS WOODLEY PERSUADED HERSELF SHE SAW A TEAR START IN HIS EYE
THE COLOUR SPREAD OVER SIR EDWARD'S FACE--DORRIFORTH WAS CONFOUNDED--AND MR SANDFORD LOOKED ENRAGED
COMPASSION CHANGED HIS LANGUAGE AND SOFTENED ALL THOSE HARSH TONES THAT USED TO DENOUNCE PERDITION
AND LET ME ADVISE YOU NOT TO DEFER THAT MARRIAGE LONG LEST IN THE TIME YOU DISAGREE AND SHE SHOULD REFUSE TO BECOME YOUR LEGAL SPOUSE I THINK THERE IS DANGER RETURNED LORD ELMWOOD AND THEREFORE OUR SECOND MARRIAGE MUST TAKE PLACE TO-MORROW TO THIS THE LADIES OBJECTED AND SANDFORD WAS TO FIX THEIR SECOND WEDDING-DAY AS HE HAD DONE THEIR FIRST
AND IF YOU HAD NOT THAT EXCUSE THERE WOULD BE NONE FOR YOU THEN AT PRESENT THERE IS AN EXCUSE--I THANK YOU MR SANDFORD--THIS IS THE KINDEST THING YOU EVER SAID TO ME
HE HAD SEEN LADY MATILDA THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT BUT HE HAD BEHELD HER CONSIDERABLY ALTERED IN HER LOOKS AND IN HER HEALTH
BELIEVING THAT THROUGH HIS INTERPOSITION IN SPITE OF HIS WARD'S ATTACHMENT HE MIGHT YET BE DEPRIVED OF HER
MR SANDFORD DID IN HIS PRESENCE RETURNED MISS WOODLEY AND YOU MAY GO WITH THE UTMOST DECORUM OR I WOULD NOT TELL YOU SO SHE REQUIRED NO PROTESTATIONS OF THIS BUT READILY FOLLOWED HER BELOVED ADVISER WHOSE KINDNESS NEVER APPEARED IN SO AMIABLE A LIGHT AS AT THAT MOMENT
STILL HAD SHE A HEART INCLINED AND OFTENTIMES AFFECTED BY TENDENCIES LESS UNWORTHY
ACCORDINGLY SHE SAT ALONE OR WITH MISS WOODLEY IN HER OWN APARTMENT AS MUCH AS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CIVILITY WHICH HER GUARDIAN HAD REQUESTED AND WHICH FORBADE HER TOTALLY ABSENTING HERSELF
12 WHEN THIS LETTER WAS BROUGHT TO MISS WOODLEY SHE KNEW WHAT IT CONTAINED BEFORE SHE OPENED IT AND THEREFORE TOOK IT WITH AN AIR OF RESIGNATION--YET THOUGH SHE GUESSED THE MOMENTOUS PART OF ITS CONTENTS SHE DREADED IN WHAT WORDS IT MIGHT BE RELATED
BESIDES THOUGH A PEER LORD MARGRAVE WAS UNUSED TO RANK WITH PEERS
BUT LITTLE COULD BE HOPED FROM THAT
THEN THREW HIMSELF UPRIGHT ON HIS CHAIR AND TOOK A PINCH OF SNUFF UPON THE STRENGTH OF THE EARL'S UNEASINESS
SHE EXPECTED IT WITH RAPTURE BUT BEFORE ITS ARRIVAL SUNK UNDER THE CARE OF EXPECTATION
WHILE HE WAS MR DORRIFORTH AND CONFINED TO A SINGLE LIFE HIS INDIFFERENCE TO HER CHARMS WAS RATHER AN HONOURABLE THAN A REPROACHFUL TRAIT IN HIS CHARACTER AND IN REALITY SHE ADMIRED HIM FOR THE INSENSIBILITY
HOW SHALL I CONTRIVE TO AVOID HIM SAID MISS MILNER IF IN THE EVENING HE SHOULD OFFER TO HAND ME INTO MY CARRIAGE
HAD SHE ON OR HAD SHE NOT ON A COAT ASKED SANDFORD
THEY LIFTED HER UP AND BROUGHT HER TO THE DOOR WHICH ENTERED INTO THE GARDEN
BUT AS SHE FELT A DESIRE TO SEE HIM IN COMPANY OF HIS INTENDED BRIDE FOR SHE FANCIED SHE COULD PERCEIVE HIS SECRET SENTIMENTS COULD SHE ONCE SEE THEM TOGETHER SHE ANSWERED NOT UNGRACIOUSLY YES MY COMPLIMENTS TO MR AND MISS FENTON AND I HOPE THEY WILL FAVOUR ME WITH THEIR COMPANY THEN MADAM IF THEY COME YOU MAY EXPECT ME--ELSE NOT HE BOWED AND LEFT THE ROOM
HE HAD BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IT AND CAME FROM WINDSOR AT THAT LATE HOUR
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF JOY THEY DID NOT SUPPOSE HER FEATURES COULD HAVE WORN
THE INIQUITY OF OBLIVION BLINDLY SCATTERETH HER POPPY AND NOWHERE MORE BLINDLY THAN IN THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS
DO YOU SUPPOSE I TOLD YOU THIS TO MAKE YOU HATE HIM NO THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT REPLIED MATILDA
AND A SURGEON BEING COME TO EXAMINE HIS WOUND HE RETIRED INTO HIS OWN CHAMBER
THIS ATTENTION HAD SOMETHING IN IT SO TENDER SO OFFICIOUS AND YET SO SINCERE THAT IT BROUGHT THE TEARS INTO MISS WOODLEY'S EYES ATTRACTED THE NOTICE OF MR SANDFORD AND THE OBSERVATION OF MRS HORTON
WHAT IS THAT SAID MISS WOODLEY
INSTRUCT ME WHAT I CAN DO TO SHOW MY ESTEEM AND RESPECT RATHER THAN PERMIT ME THUS UNGUIDED TO RUSH UPON WHAT YOU MAY CONSTRUE INTO INSULT AND ARROGANCE MISS WOODLEY WENT TO MATILDA TOOK HER HAND THEN WIPED THE TEARS FROM HER EYES WHILE MATILDA RECLINED AGAINST HER ENTIRELY REGARDLESS OF RUSHBROOK'S PRESENCE
HE TALKED SERIOUSLY OF MARRYING--BUT NOT ME MANY YEARS LATER ONE SEPTEMBER SHE AMUSED HERSELF BY MAKING OUT A LIST OF ALL THE SEPTEMBERS SINCE HER MARRIAGE WITH BRIEF NOTES AS TO HER STATE OF MIND DURING EACH
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN AT A MASQUERADE AND RECEIVED THEM WITH ECSTASY--THE MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE MASQUE BEING AT THE HOUSE OF A WOMAN OF FASHION SHE DID NOT CONCEIVE THERE COULD BE ANY OBJECTION TO HER GOING
IF IT WOULD NOT HE STILL DOES NOT LOVE ME AS I WISH TO BE LOVED--IF IT WOULD MY TRIUMPH MY FELICITY WOULD BE ENHANCED THESE THOUGHTS WERE MERE PHANTOMS OF THE BRAIN AND NEVER BY SYSTEM PUT INTO ACTION
IN ALL THY RIGOUR OH
HE THEN AFTER TAKING LEAVE AND GOING TO THE DOOR--TURNED BACK AND SAID MY LORD IT WAS EASY TO GUESS ON WHAT HE WAS PREPARING TO SPEAK--HIS VOICE FAILED THE TEARS BEGAN TO TRICKLE DOWN HIS CHEEKS HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND COULD PROCEED NO FARTHER
NEVER BE ERASED HE ENDEAVOURED TO RAISE HER SHE PERSISTED TO KNEEL--AND HERE THE AFFRIGHT THE TERROR THE ANGUISH SHE ENDURED DISCOVERED TO HER HER OWN SENTIMENTS--WHICH TILL THAT MOMENT SHE HAD DOUBTED--AND SHE CONTINUED I NO LONGER PRETEND TO CONCEAL MY PASSION--I LOVE LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY HER GUARDIAN STARTED
AND AFTER SOME LITTLE TIME SHE WAS IN THE SAME TRANQUIL STATE THAT SHE ENJOYED BEFORE HE CAME
INQUIRING FOR MISS WOODLEY HE EASILY GAINED ADMITTANCE
MY LORD AND I SUPPED THERE LAST NIGHT AND THAT MADE US SO LATE HOME LORD ELMWOOD ENTERED SOON AFTER AND BOWING TO HIS WARD CONFIRMED WHAT HAD BEEN SAID BY TELLING HER THAT MISS FENTON HAD CHARGED HIM WITH HER KINDEST RESPECTS HOW DOES POOR MISS FENTON LOOK MRS HORTON ASKED LORD ELMWOOD
HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND SAID I THINK MISS WOODLEY MISS MILNER WAS EXTREMELY TO BLAME THOUGH I DID NOT CHUSE TO TELL HER SO BEFORE MR SANDFORD IN GIVING LORD FREDERICK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HER UNLESS SHE MEANS THAT HE SHALL RENEW HIS ADDRESSES THAT I AM CERTAIN REPLIED MISS WOODLEY SHE DOES NOT MEAN--AND I ASSURE YOU MY LORD SERIOUSLY IT WAS BY MERE ACCIDENT SHE SAW HIM YESTERDAY EVENING OR PERMITTED HIS ATTENDANCE UPON HER TO HER CARRIAGE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT HE RETURNED QUICKLY
MY HUSBAND AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS DISTRESSES REPLIED MRS HILLGRAVE OWED A SUM OF MONEY TO HER FATHER AND FROM REPEATED PROVOCATIONS MR MILNER WAS DETERMINED TO SEIZE UPON ALL OUR EFFECTS--HIS DAUGHTER HOWEVER BY HER INTERCESSIONS PROCURED US TIME IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE THE DEBT
AND HIS SUDDEN ABSENCE SO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INTELLIGENCE THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM MISS WOODLEY INCREASED HER UNEASINESS
OTHERS OF HIS COMPANIONS ADVISED SEDUCTION
AND HAD HE NOT LIKE A TRUE LOVER CLUNG FAST TO HOPE WHILE HE COULD PERCEIVE NOTHING BUT DESPAIR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED TO TOWN RATHER THAN BY HIS STAY HAVE PLACED IN A SUBORDINATE STATE THE OBJECT OF HIS ADORATION
6D
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE BEEN TURNED OUT OF HIS HOUSE
YET HE WAS IN REALITY AS SURLY AND AS DISRESPECTFUL IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER AS USUAL
THE DEAR OBJECT OF HER FONDEST HER TRUEST AFFECTIONS WAS AWAY
SHE MUST GREATLY ESTEEM THOSE PATERNAL FAVOURS WHICH YOUR ENTREATIES GAINED HER
A GENERAL SILENCE ENSUED TILL LORD ELMWOOD RESUMING HIS ANGRY TONE CRIED DID YOU HEAR ME MR SANDFORD SANDFORD NOW WITHOUT A WORD IN REPLY MADE FOR THE DOOR--BUT THERE MATILDA IMPEDED HIM AND THROWING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK CRIED DEAR MR SANDFORD DO NOT HOW EXCLAIMED HER FATHER
DO YOU THINK LORD FREDERICK IS GONE THEN WHISPERED MISS MILNER TO MISS WOODLEY.--"I THINK NOT SHE REPLIED.--"GO ASK OF THE SERVANTS DEAR CREATURE AND MISS WOODLEY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
HE THEN ROSE UP--WALKED TWO OR THREE TIMES ACROSS THE ROOM--SAT DOWN AGAIN--TOOK UP THE PAPER--AND READ AS USUAL.--NOR LET THE VOCIFEROUS MOURNER OR THE PERPETUAL WEEPER HERE COMPLAIN OF HIS WANT OF SENSIBILITY--BUT LET THEM REMEMBER THAT LORD ELMWOOD WAS A MAN--A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING--OF COURAGE--OF FORTITUDE--ABOVE ALL A MAN OF THE NICEST FEELINGS--AND WHO SHALL SAY BUT THAT AT THE TIME HE LEANED HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND AND ROSE TO WALK AWAY THE SENSE OF WHAT HE FELT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL AS MUCH AS LADY ELMWOOD DID IN HER LAST MOMENTS
THE COMPASSIONATE THE FEELING THE JUST LORD ELMWOOD AN EXAMPLE OF IMPLACABLE RIGOUR AND INJUSTICE
BUT CAST ON A BED OF SICKNESS AND UPON THE POINT OF LEAVING HER TO HER FATE THOSE FAILINGS AT ONCE RUSHED ON HIS THOUGHT--AND ALL THE PRIDE THE FOND ENJOYMENT HE HAD TAKEN IN BEHOLDING HER OPEN THE BALL OR DELIGHT HER HEARERS WITH HER WIT ESCAPED HIS REMEMBRANCE
IN THE SHORT SPACE OF THAT PERIOD I SHALL HAVE TAKEN MY LEAVE OF YOU--_FOR EVER I SHALL VISIT ITALY AND SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE CONTINENT
WAS THERE NOT THEN SOME REASON FOR HIM TO SUPPOSE HE HAD NO FAULTS
DO NOT LOAD ME WITH THE BURTHEN--WITH THE MIGHTY BURTHEN OF YOUR LOVE FOR HER DO NOT INTERRUPT ME
ONLY BY WALKING A FEW PACES I COULD BE AT HIS FEET AND PERHAPS RECEIVE HIS BLESSING YOU MAKE ME SHUDDER CRIED MISS WOODLEY
WHAT IS IT MAKES WEALTH VALUABLE
AS MR SANDFORD WAS SITTING WITH HER AND MISS WOODLEY ONE EVENING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER A PERSON RANG AT THE BELL AND INQUIRED FOR HIM
YOU MAY COMMAND ME
HE HAD BEEN FOR SO LONG A TIME THE SUPERIOR OF ALL WITH WHOM HE LIVED HAD BEEN SO BUSIED WITH INSTRUCTING OTHERS THAT HE HAD NOT RECOLLECTED THAT HIMSELF WANTED INSTRUCTIONS--AND IN SUCH AWE DID HIS HABITUAL SEVERITY KEEP ALL ABOUT HIM THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAD NUMEROUS FRIENDS NOT ONE TOLD HIM OF HIS FAILINGS--EXCEPT JUST NOW LORD ELMWOOD BUT WHOM IN THIS INSTANCE AS A MAN IN LOVE HE WOULD NOT CREDIT
AND WITHOUT BOWING STOOD RESPECTFULLY SILENT WHILE THE COMPANY PASSED
IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM BY THE SIDE OF AN OLD FASHIONED STOOL KNEELS MISS WOODLEY PRAYING MOST DEVOUTLY FOR HER STILL BELOVED FRIEND BUT IN VAIN ENDEAVOURING TO PRAY COMPOSEDLY--FLOODS OF TEARS POUR DOWN HER FURROWED CHEEKS AND FREQUENT SOBS OF SORROW BREAK THROUGH EACH PIOUS EJACULATION
HE SAID HE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE HIM LOOK SO ILL BEGGED HIM WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS OF A PARENT TO TAKE THE ADVICE OF A PHYSICIAN AND ADDED A THOUSAND OTHER AFFECTIONATE THINGS I DETEST MR RUSHBROOK SAID MATILDA WITH HER EYES FLASHING INDIGNATION
THERE ARE FEW THINGS SO MORTIFYING TO A PROUD SPIRIT AS TO SUFFER BY IMMEDIATE COMPARISON--MEN CAN HARDLY BEAR IT BUT TO WOMEN THE PUNISHMENT IS INTOLERABLE
SUCH WAS THE YOUTHFUL WARM GENEROUS GRATEFUL BUT UNREFLECTING MIND OF RUSHBROOK
WITH A STRICT SCRUTINY INTO HIS HEART HE SOUGHT THIS KNOWLEDGE BUT ARRIVED AT IT WITH A REGRET THAT AMOUNTED TO DESPAIR
AND SHE WOULD SPORT WITH RUSHBROOK LIKE THE MOST HARMLESS CHILD WHILE HE ALL IMPASSIONED COULD WITH DIFFICULTY RESIST TELLING HER WHAT SHE MADE HIM SUFFER
WHATEVER HE MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED IF HE HAD SEEN HER DECORATED AND PREPARED TO BID DEFIANCE TO HIS COMMANDS YET EVEN UPON THAT TRIAL HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENDURED HALF THE PAINFUL SENSATIONS HE NOW FOR A MOMENT FELT--HE FELT HIMSELF TO BLAME
NAY I ASSURE YOU LORD FREDERICK IS SAFE HE RESUMED AND THE DISGRACE OF HIS BLOW WASHED ENTIRELY AWAY BY A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD FROM THIS ARM AND HE LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS LEFT ARM WHICH RESTED IN HIS WAISTCOAT AS A KIND OF SLING
NOT WITH THE APPREHENSION THAT SHE WAS HURT WAS HE THUS AGITATED FOR THE GAIETY OF HER MANNERS CONVINCED HIM THAT COULD NOT BE THE CASE NOR DID HE INDEED SUPPOSE ANY ACCIDENT OF THE KIND MENTIONED HAD OCCURRED
THEY ARE CONFUSED--THEY ARE TRIUMPHANT AT PRESENT
BUT THAT IS AN INTEREST SUB SPECIE AETERNITATIS
NAY FOR SHAME RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
NO REPLIED SANDFORD
BUT WHERE THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LET ME TELL YOU BEAUTY IS SOMETHING MUCH WORSE THAN NOTHING IN MY OPINION RETURNED DORRIFORTH
OR HIMSELF GIVE ME A PROPER REASON WHY HE CANNOT BECAUSE THERE MAY BE FRIENDSHIP WITHOUT FAMILIARITY--AND SO IT IS BETWEEN HIM AND YOU THAT CANNOT BE
THIS IS OPERA NIGHT WILL YOU GO MY LORD ASKED MISS MILNER IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE SEEMED AS IF HE WISHED BUT COULD NOT RESIST IT
AND WHAT YOU FEEL FOR HIM IMAGINE HE FEELS FOR YOU MY DEAR THOUGH MY DEAR IS A TRIVIAL PHRASE YET FROM CERTAIN PEOPLE AND UPON CERTAIN OCCASIONS IT IS A PHRASE OF INFINITE COMFORT AND ASSURANCE
THESE COOL REFLECTIONS TENDING TO THEIR SAFETY HAD THEIR WEIGHT WITH THE COMPANIONS OF THE FARMER
SO HONOUR DELICACY AND THE COMMON TIES OF DUTY MADE HIM APPROVE RATHER THAN CONDEMN HIS ATTENTION TO HER
I AM GLAD YOU ARE RETURNED MY LORD SAID MRS HORTON FOR MISS MILNER WOULD NOT EAT A MORSEL IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I HAD NO APPETITE RETURNED SHE BLUSHING LIKE CRIMSON
TO DETAIL THE PROGRESSION BY WHICH VICE GAINS A PREDOMINANCY IN THE HEART MAY BE A USEFUL LESSON
SHE FREQUENTLY BEGAN IN ONE BUT NOT THREE WORDS COULD SHE UTTER BEFORE HER TONES SUNK INTO DEJECTION
HE FOUND HIMSELF HOWEVER RE-ASSURED BY OVERHEARING THE EARL LAUGH AND SPEAK IN A TONE EXPRESSIVE OF THE UTMOST GOOD HUMOUR TO SANDFORD WHO WAS WITH HIM
FOR SINCE HIS PERILOUS SITUATION WITH LORD ELMWOOD HE WAS SO FULLY CONVINCED OF THE GENERAL PHILANTHROPY OF SANDFORD'S CHARACTER THAT IN SPITE OF HIS CHURLISH MANNERS HE NOW ADDRESSED HIM FREE FROM THAT RESERVE TO WHICH HIS ROUGH BEHAVIOUR HAD FORMERLY GIVEN BIRTH
LOVE THAT PRODUCES WONDERS THAT SEDUCES AND SUBDUES THE MOST DETERMINED AND RIGID SPIRITS HAD IN TWO INSTANCES OVERCOME THE INFLEXIBILITY OF LORD ELMWOOD
SHE THEREFORE AFTER REMAINING CONFINED TO HER APARTMENTS NEAR THREE WEEKS EXCEPTING THOSE ANXIOUS WALKS SHE AND MATILDA STOLE WHILE LORD ELMWOOD DINED OR BEFORE HE ROSE IN A MORNING WENT ONE FORENOON INTO HIS APARTMENTS WHERE AS USUAL SHE FOUND HIM WITH MR SANDFORD AND MR RUSHBROOK
SHE WAS EVEN PREVAILED UPON BY HER PROMISES TO SIT BY HER SIDE AND WATCH TO THROW HERSELF ON THE BED AND SUFFER SLEEP FOR A FEW MINUTES--FOR SLEEP TO HER WAS SUFFERING
MISS WOODLEY WAS EXCEEDINGLY AFFECTED BY THIS EVENT AND SAID LITTLE ELSE ON ANY OTHER SUBJECT
AND THOUGH SHE WISHED NO ILL TO MISS MILNER YET WITH AN INCLINATION BENT UPON SEEING SOMETHING NEW--WITHOUT THE FATIGUE OF GOING OUT OF HER OWN HOUSE--SHE WAS NOT OVER SCRUPULOUS WHAT THAT NOVELTY MIGHT BE
AND HER HANDS TREMBLED AND HER HEART BEAT WITH RAPTURE WHILE SHE WROTE THE ANSWER THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULD NOT BE RECEIVED BY HIM WITH ONE EMOTION LIKE THOSE WHICH SHE EXPERIENCED
YOUR HEART MAY BE DISENGAGED REPEATED HE
BUT AS SHE ONLY LOOKED AND DID NOT SPEAK HE ROSE UP AND SOON AFTER SAID WITH A FRIENDLY TONE HE HAD SELDOM USED IN HER PRESENCE I SINCERELY WISH YOU A GOOD NIGHT AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE MISS MILNER EXCLAIMED HOWEVER MY FATE MAY HAVE BEEN PRECIPITATED BY THE UNKINDNESS OF MR SANDFORD YET FOR THAT PARTICLE OF CONCERN WHICH HE HAS SHOWN FOR ME THIS NIGHT I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO HIM AY CRIED MRS HORTON GOOD MR SANDFORD MAY SHOW HIS KINDNESS NOW WITHOUT ANY DANGER FROM ITS CONSEQUENCES
BUT CONTINUED HE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST WAS NOT ENTIRELY REPLIED MATILDA AND SINCE IT IS GRANTED I AM CARELESS
AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER WHOLE LIFE APPEARED CARELESS WHAT HE MIGHT THINK OF HER BEHAVIOUR:--BUT HER WHOLE THOUGHTS WERE OCCUPIED UPON THE BUSINESS WHICH HAD EMPLOYED THE CHIEF OF HER DAY
BEHOLD ME ALSO--IN MY ALTERED FACE THERE IS NO ANXIETY--NO JOY OR SORROW--ALL IS OVER.----MY WHOLE FRAME IS MOTIONLESS--MY HEART BEATS NO MORE
MISS WOODLEY WISHED TO DIVERT HER THOUGHTS FROM THE OBJECT WHICH COULD ONLY MAKE HER WRETCHED AND AS THEY RODE HOME BY MANY ENCOMIUMS UPON LORD FREDERICK ENDEAVOURED TO INCITE HER TO A REGARD FOR HIM
IT SERVED HIM AS A SECOND WARNING OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION THAT WAS NECESSARY
IN A WORD SHE SAW NO ONE'S MISFORTUNES EQUAL TO HER OWN BECAUSE SHE SAW NO ONE SO LITTLE ABLE TO BEAR MISFORTUNE
TO ALL HER HOPES AT ONCE
NOR WOULD HE EVEN FLATTER THE SUPPOSED AUTHORITY HE POSSESSED OVER HIM BY URGING HIM TO REMAIN IN HIS HOUSE A SINGLE DAY CONTRARY TO HIS INCLINATIONS
YES REPLIED HE IF YOU DESIRE IT THIS SHALL BE HIS HOME--YOU SHALL BE A MOTHER AND I WILL HENCEFORWARD BE A FATHER TO HIM SANDFORD WHO WAS PRESENT LOOKED UNUSUALLY SOUR AT THIS HIGH TOKEN OF REGARD FOR MISS MILNER
MISS WOODLEY SAW HER AS THE GAY WARD OF DORRIFORTH
OVERCOME WITH THE WANT OF REST FOR TWO NIGHTS FROM HER DISTRACTING FEARS AND ALL THOSE FEARS NOW HUSHED
MY LORD SAID SHE WITH A TREMULOUS VOICE PROMISE ME DECLARE TO ME NAY SWEAR TO ME THAT IT SHALL EVER REMAIN A SECRET IN YOUR OWN BREAST AND I WILL REVEAL TO YOU ON WHOM SHE HAS PLACED HER AFFECTIONS THIS PREPARATION MADE LORD ELMWOOD TREMBLE AND HE RAN OVER INSTANTLY IN HIS MIND ALL THE PERSONS HE COULD RECOLLECT IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE BY THOUGHT QUICKER THAN BY WORDS
PAINTING AT THE SAME TIME A THOUSAND BRIGHT HOPES FROM WATCHING EVERY EMOTION OF HIS SOUL AND CATCHING EVERY PROPER OCCASION TO EXCITE OR INCREASE HIS PATERNAL SENTIMENTS
I SHALL SEND FOR MISS WOODLEY TOO IMMEDIATELY CONTINUED HE
MISS WOODLEY TOOK HER AT HER WORD AND HURRIED HER IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE ROOM
AND DETESTED THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY HAD EACH ESCAPED LORD ELMWOOD'S SUSPICION AND PERHAPS ANGER THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS SO DEXTEROUSLY MANAGED
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE COME BACK SAID SANDFORD BUT AT THE PLACE WHERE WE WENT TO DINE ALL THE ROOMS WERE FILLED WITH COMPANY LORD ELMWOOD PUT THE WING OF A FOWL ON MISS MILNER'S PLATE BUT WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY ASKING IF SHE CHOSE ANY
HE IS THE NEXT HEIR--I HAD FORGOT
NOT AT ALL TO-DAY HOW CAME THAT ABOUT MY LORD MISS MILNER PLAYED THE ACE OF DIAMONDS INSTEAD OF THE KING OF HEARTS
AND IN HER FRIEND'S APARTMENT GAVE WAY TO ALL THE LANGUAGE OF PASSION WARMED WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF MEETING ITS RETURN
MISS WOODLEY FOR THE FIRST TIME DISOBEYED THE WILL OF MR SANDFORD
AND YET I THOUGHT HE HELD ME IN HIS ARMS SHE REPLIED--"I THOUGHT I FELT HIS HANDS PRESS MINE.--LET ME SLEEP AND DREAM AGAIN NOW THINKING IT BEST TO UNDECEIVE HER IT IS NO DREAM MY DEAR RETURNED MISS WOODLEY
HE TREMBLED EXTREMELY AND LOOKED PALE
SEWED
HE BEHELD THIS WITH THE RAPTURE AND THE HUMILITY OF A LOVER
NO SHE REPLIED MY HEART IS NOT GIVEN AWAY
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU AND TO WHICH I REQUIRE A SERIOUS AND UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER
MADAM REPLIED THE NOBLEMAN TO BE PLAIN WITH YOU I AM IN LOVE I DO NOT THE LEAST DOUBT IT MY LORD REPLIED MISS WOODLEY
DO YOU WANT AN ADVOCATE BEFORE YOUR GUARDIAN ALONE WHO HAS EVER TREATED YOU WITH TENDERNESS IT IS THAT VERY TENDERNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME
MISS MILNER COULD SCARCE RESTRAIN THE JOY IT GAVE HER
YOU ARE ARRIVED AT THE ZENITH OF PERFECTION IN A WOMAN AND TO ADD ONE QUALIFICATION MORE WOULD BE AN ANTI-CLIMAX OH CRIED RUSHBROOK WITH WARMTH I LOVED HER BEFORE I EVER BEHELD HER LOVED HER CRIED SANDFORD WITH ASTONISHMENT YOU ARE TALKING OF WHAT YOU DID NOT INTEND I AM INDEED RETURNED HE IN CONFUSION I FELL BY ACCIDENT ON THE WORD LOVE AND BY THE SAME ACCIDENT STUMBLED ON THE WORD BEAUTY
MISS MILNER IS WOUNDED AT THE HEART BY THE COLD AND UNKIND MANNERS OF HER GUARDIAN BUT DARES NOT TAKE ONE STEP TO RETRIEVE HIS OPINION
YOU DO NOT_--MR SANDFORD LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED
FOR HE IS AN HONEST GOOD YOUNG MAN AND WOULD NOT TELL A LIE UPON ANY ACCOUNT--WOULD YOU GEORGE LORD ELMWOOD ORDERED MISS MILNER'S WOMAN TO BE AGAIN SENT UP
HE THANKED HER BUT ADDED WITH A SIGH IF I HAVE GIVEN UP CONTENT IN SEARCH OF JOY I SHALL PERHAPS BE A LOSER BY THE VENTURE SOON AFTER THIS HE WISHED THEM A GOOD NIGHT AND RETIRED
SHE ATTEMPTED IN VAIN TO OBTAIN A THEATRICAL ENGAGEMENT
VOID OF RESPECT FOR THOSE CORRODING SORROWS WHICH HAD IMBITTERED SO MANY YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND IN OPEN VIOLATION OF HIS MOST PEREMPTORY COMMANDS
THIS BROUGHT MRS HORTON TO HER RECOLLECTION AND SHE CRIED OH
WITH THESE ALLUREMENTS NO WONDER IF SHE TOOK PLEASURE IN HIS COMPANY--NO WONDER IF SHE TOOK PRIDE IN HAVING IT KNOWN THAT HE WAS AMONG THE NUMBER OF HER DEVOTED ADMIRERS
FOR IF HE IS IN SPIRITS THAT YOU ARE IN THIS HOUSE--SO NEAR HIM--POSITIVELY UNDER HIS PROTECTION--YET HE WILL NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO THINK IT IS THE CAUSE OF HIS CONTENT--AND THE SENTIMENTS HE HAS ADOPTED AND WHICH ARE NOW BECOME NATURAL TO HIM WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS EVER
TO THAT EXPECTATION THEY IN GREAT MEASURE ATTRIBUTED MISS MILNER'S VISIBLE CONTENT
BUT IMMENSELY RICH AND POSSESSED OF QUALITIES THAT MADE HIM WORTHY OF THE HAPPINESS TO WHICH HE ASPIRED
IN THIS HUMILIATING STATE FOR EVEN MANY OF THE DOMESTICS COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THEIR LORD'S DISPLEASURE SANDFORD PASSED THREE DAYS AND WAS BEGINNING THE FOURTH WHEN SITTING WITH LORD ELMWOOD AND RUSHBROOK JUST AFTER BREAKFAST A SERVANT ENTERED SAYING AS HE OPENED THE DOOR TO SOMEBODY WHO FOLLOWED YOU MUST WAIT TILL YOU HAVE MY LORD'S PERMISSION THIS ATTRACTED THEIR EYES TO THE DOOR AND A MAN MEANLY DRESSED WALKED IN FOLLOWING CLOSE TO THE SERVANT
SHE DESCRIBED THE SENTIMENTS SHE HAD READ IN LORD ELMWOOD'S LOOKS
WHEN LORD ELMWOOD HAD BEEN AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT ABOUT SIX WEEKS MR RUSHBROOK HIS NEPHEW AND HIS ADOPTED CHILD--THAT FRIENDLESS BOY WHOM POOR LADY ELMWOOD FIRST INTRODUCED INTO HIS UNCLE'S HOUSE AND BY HER KINDNESS PRESERVED THERE--ARRIVED FROM HIS TRAVELS AND WAS RECEIVED BY HIS UNCLE WITH ALL THE MARKS OF AFFECTION DUE TO THE MAN HE THOUGHT WORTHY TO BE HIS HEIR
BUT WHERE YOU ARE MR DORRIFORTH UNLESS I AM TURNED OUT I SHALL ALWAYS THINK IT MY DUTY TO COME MISS MILNER CURTSIED AS MUCH AS TO SAY HE WAS WELCOME TO COME
FOR THOUGH HE WAS OFFENDED AT HIS WARD'S BEHAVIOUR ON THE OCCASION AND CONSIDERED THAT SHE COMMITTED A FAULT IN TELLING HIM SHE WOULD GO YET HE NEVER SUSPECTED SHE MEANT TO DO SO NOT EVEN AT THE TIME SHE SAID IT MUCH LESS THAT SHE WOULD PERSIST COOLLY AND DELIBERATELY IN SO DIRECT A CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
HE CAST HIS EYES AWAY AGAIN IN CONFUSION
IT IS A SUBJECT RETURNED LADY MATILDA WHICH I DID NOT IMAGINE YOU MR SANDFORD WOULD HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO HAVE MENTIONED LIGHTLY IN YOUR PRESENCE LIGHTLY
THE NEXT DAY THE WHOLE CASTLE APPEARED TO LADY MATILDA THOUGH SHE WAS IN SOME DEGREE RETIRED FROM IT ALL TUMULT AND BUSTLE AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHILE LORD ELMWOOD WAS THERE
BUT THE INTEREST OF HER STYLE DOES NOT LIE IN ITS INTRINSIC MERIT SO MUCH AS IN THE USE TO WHICH SHE PUTS IT
I WOULD RATHER COMPLY WITH HER DESIRES THAN NOT
I HAD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN DOWN CRIED HARRY FEARING NO OTHER DANGER
WOULD YOU PLEASE TO SEE HIS LORDSHIP ASKED HER MAID
IN A SINGLE INSTANCE HOWEVER THIS CALMNESS WAS NEAR DESERTING HIM
SHE HAD A HACKNEY-COACH ORDERED RODE SEVERAL MILES OUT OF TOWN AND RETURNED TO DINNER WITH SO LITTLE REMAINS OF HER SWOLN EYES THAT COMPLAINING OF THE HEAD-ACHE WAS A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR THEM
LORD ELMWOOD LOOKED CONCERNED WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED--MR SANDFORD SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE STARTED--BUT LOOKED MORE SURPRISED THAN ALARMED--HER ALARM WAS AUGMENTED
AND THAT KNOWING HER BEREFT OF EVERY SUPPORT BUT THROUGH HIMSELF THAT IDEA MIGHT FORM SOME LITTLE TIE BETWEEN THEM AND BE AT LEAST A TOKEN OF THE RELATIONSHIP
THIS WAS THE TURNING-POINT OF HER CAREER
I HAVE ONLY TO SAY MY LORD RETURNED RUSHBROOK THAT ALTHOUGH MY HEART MAY BE TOTALLY DISENGAGED I MAY YET BE DISINCLINED TO MARRIAGE MAY
EVEN SO ARDENTLY DID I DESIRE TO RENDER THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU HAPPY THAT THOUGH HE CAME ARMED AGAINST MY LIFE HAD I NOT REFLECTED THAT PREVIOUS TO OUR ENGAGEMENT IT WOULD APPEAR LIKE FEAR AND THE MEANS OF BARTERING FOR HIS FORGIVENESS I SHOULD HAVE REVEALED YOUR SENTIMENTS THE MOMENT I HAD SEEN HIM
WHILE SANDFORD WITH ALL THE DIGNITY OF HIS OFFICIAL CHARACTER DELIVERED THESE WORDS MY LORD WHILE I THOUGHT MY COUNSEL MIGHT SAVE YOU FROM THE WORST OF MISFORTUNES CONJUGAL STRIFE I IMPORTUNED YOU HOURLY AND SET FORTH YOUR DANGER IN THE LIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME
AND AS I FRANKLY CONFESS MY ENVY OF MR RUSHBROOK I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON MY MALICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW BUT A CONSEQUENT CRIME THE SUBJECT NOW TURNED AGAIN UPON LORD MARGRAVE
LORD ELMWOOD'S DEPARTURE TO TOWN FORWARDED THIS HOPE AND FLATTERING HIMSELF THAT THE HUMILIATING STATE IN WHICH MATILDA MUST FEEL HERSELF IN THE HOUSE OF HER FATHER MIGHT GLADLY INDUCE HER TO TAKE SHELTER UNDER ANY OTHER PROTECTION HE BOLDLY ADVANCED AS SOON AS THE EARL WAS GONE TO MAKE SUCH OVERTURE AS HIS WISHES AND HIS VANITY TOLD HIM COULD NOT BE REJECTED
A LETTER ARRIVED--SHE DEVOURED IT WITH HER EYES
YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID SANDFORD ONE DAY TO HER
FOR THEY SERVED TO SOOTH HIS IMAGINATION RACKED WITH SANDFORD'S WRATH AND HIS OWN DISPLEASURE
AND IF SHE EVER FOUND CAUSE FOR GLADNESS SHE FAR OFTENER HAD MOTIVES FOR GRIEF
EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE MADE HIM MORE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRM UNSHAKEN TEMPER OF LORD ELMWOOD AND EVERY DAY WHISPERED MORE FORCIBLY TO HIM THAT PITY GRATITUDE AND FRIENDSHIP STRONG AND AFFECTIONATE AS THESE PASSIONS ARE WERE WEAK AND COLD TO THAT WHICH HAD GAINED THE POSSESSION OF HIS HEART--HE DOUBTED BUT HE DID NOT LONG DOUBT THAT WHICH HE FELT WAS LOVE
HE STOOD SILENT--CONFOUNDED--HOPING THAT HE WAS FORGIVEN--FEARING THAT HE WAS NOT
HE RUSHED FORWARD REGARDLESS OF HIS OPPOSER AND IN GREAT AGITATION CRIED MY LORD IF YOU PLEASE I HAVE BUSINESS WITH YOU PROVIDED YOU WILL CHUSE TO BE ALONE LORD ELMWOOD STRUCK WITH THE INTRUDER'S EARNESTNESS BADE THE SERVANT LEAVE THE ROOM
1798
WHAT WILL THE ABSENCE OF A FEW MONTHS EFFECT SAID SHE PLEADING HER OWN CAUSE
I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD BUT FOR WHAT MY PASSIONS NOW DICTATE CONTINUED HE I WILL NOT ANSWER
BUT HER GUARDIAN WROTE TO HER AND THOUGH IT WAS ON A TOPIC OF SORROW THE LETTER GAVE HER JOY--THE SENTIMENTS IT EXPRESSED WERE MERELY COMMON-PLACE YET SHE VALUED THEM AS THE DEAREST EFFUSIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND AFFECTION
AND EVEN IN THAT CASE HOW SMALL WOULD BE THE LOSS TO SOCIETY IF HE WAS PROCEEDING
AND THE MOST HUMBLE AND INSINUATING VOICE SAID WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO LEAD YOU TO YOUR CARRIAGE SHE WAS AWAKENED FROM HER REVERY AND FOUND LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY BY HER SIDE
HE THOUGHT HER WEEPING WAS A NEW REPROACH TO HIS FRIEND MR SANDFORD AND THAT TO SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE MOVED BY IT WOULD BE A TACIT CONDEMNATION OF HIS FRIEND'S CONDUCT
IF YOU DOUBT MY WORDS OR MY SENSES SAID SANDFORD CALL GIFFARD AND LET HIM INFORM YOU
BUT THAT WAS THE VERY LAST METHOD HIS LORDSHIP HIMSELF APPROVED AS MARRIAGE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE FOLLOWED LORD ELMWOOD'S CONSENT
WHAT TWO ASKED LORD ELMWOOD
THE REPUTATION OF MRS INCHBALD'S CONTEMPORARY FANNY BURNEY IS A CASE IN POINT
HOW EFFECT A RESCUE
HE WENT APPARENTLY SUBMISSIVE BUT THE MOMENT HE SHOWED THIS SUBMISSION HE TOOK THE RESOLUTION OF PAYING A VISIT HIMSELF TO THE FARM AT WHICH LADY MATILDA RESIDED
AT LENGTH TRYING TO ESCAPE THE SNARE INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LED HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE HER ON THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL WHEN HER EYES OPENED AND SHE UTTERED SAVE ME HER VOICE UNMANNED HIM
SERENE AND DIGNIFIED AS IF NO SUCH EXCLAMATION HAD BEEN UTTERED WILLIAM DELIVERED THE FATAL SPEECH ENDING WITH DEAD DEAD DEAD SHE FAINTED AS HE CLOSED THE PERIOD AND WAS CARRIED BACK TO PRISON IN A SWOON
DURING THIS TIME THEY WERE ONCE HOWEVER VERY NEAR BECOMING THE DEAREST FRIENDS IN EXPRESSION AS WELL AS IN SENTIMENT
WHILE SANDFORD SHOOK HANDS WITH THE FARMER A THOUSAND TIMES
IT IS AN AUTHOR WHO SPEAKS SENSE AND REASON--WILL YOU PARDON THE IMPATIENCE I FEEL FOR SUCH COMPANY
EXCEPT INDEED THAT HE WAS LESS THOUGHTFUL AND NOW AND THEN CHEERFUL
TILL A SERVANT CAME INTO THE ROOM AND ASKED MISS MILNER AT WHAT TIME SHE SHOULD WANT THE CARRIAGE
THE MOMENT LORD ELMWOOD STARTED WHICH WAS THE MOMENT HE ENTERED LORD FREDERICK AROSE
BUT WHETHER FROM THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION FROM FEELING HERSELF MORE THAN ORDINARILY OFFENDED BY HER GUARDIAN'S PRAISE OF THIS LADY OR THAT THERE WAS A RESERVE IN MISS FENTON THAT DID NOT ACCORD WITH HER OWN FRANK AND INGENUOUS DISPOSITION SO AS TO ENGAGE HER ESTEEM CERTAIN IT IS THAT SHE TOOK INFINITE SATISFACTION IN HEARING HER BEAUTY AND VIRTUES DEPRECIATED OR TURNED INTO RIDICULE PARTICULARLY IF MR DORRIFORTH WAS PRESENT
SHE HAS NO FIRM GRASP OF THE MASCULINE ELEMENTS IN CHARACTER
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU WILL BE VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH THEM WHEN YOU SEE HOW ELEGANTLY THEY ARE BOUND MY DEAR SAID MRS HORTON WHY HAVE YOU BOUGHT CHINA
DEAR MISS WOODLEY CRIED MISS MILNER WHY PERSUADE LORD ELMWOOD TO PUT ON A MASK JUST AT THE TIME HE HAS LAID IT ASIDE HIS PATIENCE WAS NOW TEMPTED TO ITS HEIGHT AND HE ANSWERED IF YOU SUSPECT ME OF INCONSISTENCY MADAM YOU SHALL FIND ME CHANGED PLEASED THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE AT LAST TO IRRITATE HIM SHE SMILED WITH A DEGREE OF TRIUMPH AND IN THAT HUMOUR WAS GOING TO REPLY
BUT MOST OF ALL SHE WAS ASTONISHED AT HER VENTURING ON SUCH A CHARACTER--FOR THOUGH IT REPRESENTED THE GODDESS OF CHASTITY YET FROM THE BUSKINS AND THE PETTICOAT FESTOONED FAR ABOVE THE ANCLE IT HAD ON A FIRST GLANCE THE APPEARANCE OF A FEMALE MUCH LESS VIRTUOUS
BUT AS THESE WERE FEELINGS WHICH HER PRIDE WOULD NOT SUFFER HER TO DISCLOSE EVEN TO HER FRIEND WHO WOULD HAVE CONDOLED WITH HER THEIR EFFECTS WERE DOUBLY POIGNANT
WHAT SHOULD MAKE A MAN OF SENSE OUT OF TEMPER BUT A WORTHY OBJECT AND HE LOOKED AT MISS MILNER
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS INTRODUCED BOTH TO MISS MILNER AND TO MR DORRIFORTH BUT RECEIVED FROM EACH AN ANSWER SO EXPLICIT THAT LEFT HIS NEPHEW NO LONGER IN DOUBT BUT THAT ALL FARTHER PURSUIT WAS VAIN
SHE NOW COMMENCED HOSTILITIES AGAINST ALL HIS ARGUMENTS HIS LEARNING AND HIS FAVOURITE AXIOMS
TO WHICH HE REPLIED NO BUT I HOPE MR SANDFORD YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO KNOW SAID MISS MILNER
MY LORD SAID HE ON THE STORMY SEA UPON WHICH YOU ARE EMBARKED THOUGH YOU WILL NOT SHUN THE ROCKS THAT YOUR FAITHFUL PILOT WOULD POINT OUT HE WILL NEVERTHELESS SAIL IN YOUR COMPANY AND LAMENT OVER YOUR WATERY GRAVE
HUNG UPON SANDFORD
SHE WAS TOO MUCH EMBARRASSED TO REPLY AND HE CONTINUED WE HAVE ALL MUCH TO PARDON IN ONE ANOTHER
NOT YET NOT YET SHE REPLIED
BUT BEFORE THEY ARRIVED AT THEIR OWN DOOR IT CAME INTO MISS MILNER'S REMEMBRANCE THAT THERE WAS A GRAVE STERNNESS IN THE MANNERS OF HER GUARDIAN WHEN PROVOKED THE RECOLLECTION OF WHICH MADE HER A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE--HER FRIEND WHO KNEW HIM BETTER THAN SHE DID WAS MORE SO
SHE HAD BEEN PASSING THE WHOLE MORNING AT AN AUCTION AND HAD LAID OUT NEAR TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IN DIFFERENT THINGS FOR WHICH SHE HAD NO ONE USE BUT BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SAID TO BE CHEAP--AMONG THE REST WAS A LOT OF BOOKS UPON CHEMISTRY AND SOME LATIN AUTHORS
BUT I AM AN OLD MAN AND THE CHANGES I HAVE BEEN WITNESS TO IN MY LORD'S HOUSE SINCE I FIRST LIVED IN IT HAS ENCREASED MY AGE MANY YEARS
FOR NOTHING UNLESS SHE WAS LOCKED UP SHOULD ALTER THE RESOLUTION SHE HAD FORMED OF BEING THERE TO REMONSTRATE AT THAT MOMENT MISS WOODLEY KNEW WOULD BE IN VAIN--HER COACH CAME TO THE DOOR AND SHE DROVE AWAY
FOR ON YOUR WILL HIS FATE SHALL DEPEND LIKE LIGHTNING SHE FLEW OUT OF THE ROOM
I MYSELF AM TOO HASTY CONTINUED LORD ELMWOOD AND UNHAPPILY TOO MUCH DETERMINED UPON WHAT I HAVE ONCE THOUGH PERHAPS RASHLY SAID TO SPEAK UPON A TOPIC WHERE IT IS PROBABLE I SHALL MEET WITH OPPOSITION
HER FATHER HAVING MADE IT HIS REQUEST THAT SHE MIGHT FOR A TIME AT LEAST RESIDE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER GUARDIAN RECEIVE THE SAME VISITS AND CULTIVATE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS
AND THAT THEIR MARRIAGE WOULD BE SOLEMNIZED AS SOON AS THE MOURNING FOR THE LATE LORD ELMWOOD WAS OVER
AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN OPPOSE YOUR INCLINATION TO REMAIN SINGLE THIS SENTENCE AS IT EXCLUDED THE IDEA OF SOLICITING FOR HIMSELF GAVE HER THE UTMOST PAIN
WELL--HOW DO YOU FIND YOURSELF SAID HE TO HER
SANDFORD NOW WITH A DETERMINED COUNTENANCE WENT COOLLY UP TO LADY MATILDA AND TAKING HER HAND SEEMED RESOLVED TO LEAD HER TO THE CARRIAGE
BUT NOT CANDIDLY--NOR WITH ANY APPEARANCE OF CANDOUR
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO KNOW THAT HIS THREATS ARE GENERALLY THE SAME AS IF THEY WERE EXECUTED YOU ARE VERY GOOD SAID MISS WOODLEY TO ACQUAINT ME OF THIS IN TIME--I MAY NOW WARN MISS MILNER OF IT AND SHE MAY OBSERVE MORE CIRCUMSPECTION BY NO MEANS CRIED SANDFORD HASTILY--"WHAT WOULD YOU WARN HER FOR
AFTER MY NOVEL SIMPLE STORY
FOR THERE ARE BUT TWO PERSONS WHOM SHE HAS LEFT BEHIND HER TO HOPE FOR YOUR PROTECTION AND WHO ARE THOSE TWO CRIED HE HASTILY
HE GAZED WITH WONDER AT HIS UNCLE'S INSENSIBILITY TO HIS OWN HAPPINESS AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE LED HIM TO THE JEWEL HE CAST AWAY THOUGH EVEN HIS OWN EXPULSION SHOULD BE THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE
AND WHEN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LOOK SHE SHUDDERED
SANDFORD SELDOM FOUND FAULT WITH LADY MATILDA
AND AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE WORST PART OF HER SEX INFORMED HIM THAT RELIEF FROM POVERTY WAS THE SURE BARGAIN FOR HIS SUCCESS
BUT THEN HE SENT ME TO A MOTHER--NOW I HAVE NONE
MY LORD HAS DISCHARGED ME FROM HIS SERVICE RETURNED EDWARDS TREMBLING AND THE TEARS STARTING IN HIS EYES I AM UNDONE MR SANDFORD UNLESS YOU PLEAD FOR ME I WILL SAID SANDFORD I WILL AND YET I AM ALMOST AFRAID OF YOUR SUCCESS REPLIED THE MAN FOR MY LORD HAS ORDERED ME OUT OF HIS HOUSE THIS MOMENT
IN THE DUEL WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN LORD FREDERICK AND DORRIFORTH THE LATTER HAD RECEIVED THE FIRE OF HIS ANTAGONIST BUT POSITIVELY REFUSED TO RETURN IT
YOU HAVE BEEN AT MR FENTON'S THIS EVENING I SUPPOSE SAID SANDFORD
WHILE LORD MARGRAVE ALTERNATELY CHERISHED HIS HOPES AND HIS FEARS IN THE COUNTRY RUSHBROOK IN TOWN GAVE WAY TO HIS FEARS ONLY
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO FLY THROUGH THE PARK THIS MORNING YOU WOULD BE TAKEN FOR AN ANGEL IN GOOD EARNEST SAID LORD ELMWOOD
AND THE REMORSE AT HAVING TRANSGRESSED HIS INJUNCTIONS FOR SO TRIVIAL AN ENTERTAINMENT WEIGHED UPON HER SPIRITS AND ADDED TO ITS WEARINESS
SANDFORD WAS NOT SO EASILY RESIGNED OR COMFORTED--HE WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM WHEN THE LETTER WAS SHEWN TO HIM--CALLED IT CRUEL--STIFLED HIS TEARS AND WISHED TO SHOW HIS RESENTMENT ONLY--BUT THE FORMER BURST THROUGH ALL HIS ENDEAVOURS AND HE SUNK INTO GRIEF
MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS BY HER BEDSIDE BEGGED HER NOT TO BE ALARMED ON THAT ACCOUNT AND ASSURED HER SHE KNEW FROM ALL HER ATTENDANTS THAT SHE HAD ONLY SPOKEN WITH A FRIENDLY REMEMBRANCE AS WAS REALLY THE CASE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE DEAR TO HER
HE STARTED AT THE SIGHT OF LORD MARGRAVE
WHILE RUSHBROOK WITH THE MOST NATURAL AND HAPPY LAUGH THAT EVER WAS AFFECTED CRIED NO DON'T TELL MY LORD PRAY MISS WOODLEY SHE WAS MORE CONFUSED THAN BEFORE AND LORD ELMWOOD TURNING TO HIM ASKED WHAT THE SUBJECT WAS
BUT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD--NO FARTHER--AND ONE NEGLECT OF MY COMMANDS RELEASES ME FROM THIS PROMISE TOTALLY WE WILL TAKE CARE SIR NOT TO DISOBEY THEM THEN LISTEN TO WHAT THEY ARE FOR TO YOU I GIVE THE CHARGE OF DELIVERING THEM AGAIN
AT THE END OF A FEW MONTHS AT FARTHEST HE WILL EXPECT ME BACK AND WHERE THEN WILL BE THE MERIT OF THIS SEPARATION IN THAT TIME REPLIED MISS WOODLEY WE MAY FIND SOME METHOD TO MAKE IT LONGER TO THIS SHE LISTENED WITH A KIND OF DESPAIR BUT UTTERED SHE WAS RESIGNED,"--AND SHE PREPARED FOR HER DEPARTURE
AND HE HAS CERTAINLY GIVEN ME THE PROOF I WANTED OF LORD ELMWOOD'S LOVE
AFTER THIS INCIDENT MISS WOODLEY LEFT HER APARTMENTS LESS FREQUENTLY THAN BEFORE--SHE WAS AFRAID THOUGH TILL NOW MISTRUST HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HER HEART SHE WAS AFRAID THAT DUPLICITY MIGHT BE CONCEALED UNDER THE APPARENT FRIENDSHIP OF RUSHBROOK
BY THIS TIME ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE HAD GIVEN LORD FREDERICK TO HER AS A LOVER
THE KIND MISS WOODLEY EJACULATED A SHORT PRAYER TO HERSELF THAT HEAVEN WOULD FORGIVE HER YOUNG FRIEND THE INVOLUNTARY SIN OF RELIGIOUS IGNORANCE--WHILE MRS HORTON UNPERCEIVED AS SHE IMAGINED MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS UPON HER FOREHEAD AS A GUARD AGAINST THE INFECTIOUS TAINT OF HERETICAL OPINIONS
FOR HE STILL FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT FEAR OF HER GUARDIAN'S ANGER OR PERHAPS HIS INTERCEPTION OF THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD SENT WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF HER APPARENT INDIFFERENCE
SHE IS COMING TO TAKE A SHORT WALK
HERE HE RETRACED HIS OWN STEPS REPEATEDLY HIS WHOLE IMAGINATION ENGROSSED WITH HER IDEA TILL THE SOUND OF HER FATHER'S CARRIAGE RETURNING FROM HIS VISIT ROUSED HIM FROM THE DELUSION OF HIS TRANCE TO THE DREAD OF THE CONFUSION AND EMBARRASSMENT HE SHOULD ENDURE ON NEXT MEETING HIM
YES TWO GENTLEMEN ANSWERED THE SON OF LADY EVANS A LAD FROM SCHOOL WHOM MISS MILNER HAD TAKEN ALONG WITH HER
THE TWENTY-NINTH OF OCTOBER ARRIVED
ALTHOUGH HE HAS CERTAINLY MANY INDISCRETIONS BUT WHICH LORD ELMWOOD I SUPPOSE SAID MATILDA LOOKS UPON WITH TENDERNESS NOT UPON ALL HIS FAULTS ANSWERED SANDFORD
I'LL INSTANTLY EXPIRE WITH GRIEF IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE ME ACCUSTOMED TO THE TEARS AND REPROACHES OF THE SEX--THOUGH NOT OF THOSE LIKE HER--HE TREATED WITH CONTEMPT THESE MENACES OF ANGER AND SEIZING HER HAND CARRIED IT TO HIS LIPS
BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I MEAN TO UPBRAID YOU
HER EYES THEN OVERFLOWED WITH TEARS AND IN THE AGONY OF HER MIND NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE DID SHE LAID HER COLD HAND UPON THE PERSON NEXT TO HER--IT HAPPENED TO BE SANDFORD
BUT MISS WOODLEY INTERRUPTED HER BY REQUIRING AN EXPLANATION OF HER CONDUCT AS TO LORD FREDERICK WHOM AT LEAST SHE WAS TREATING WITH CRUELTY IF SHE ONLY MADE USE OF HIS AFFECTION TO STIMULATE THAT OF LORD ELMWOOD
1803
HE HANDED HER TO HER CARRIAGE BOWED LOW AND DISAPPEARED
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY--IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
INDEED THAT OF ITSELF WOULD BE AN OFFENCE I COULD NOT PARDON
AS HIS HEALTH RE-ESTABLISHED HIS WISHES RE-ESTABLISHED ALSO AND WITH HIS WISHES HIS DESPAIR
THE TWO LADIES IN MISS MILNER'S CARRIAGE AND DORRIFORTH IN THAT IN WHICH HE CAME
I BEG YOUR PARDON AND IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW
AND MOST PROBABLY SOME FORTUNATE EXPLANATION MAY PREVENT OUR MEETING AT ALL
YET SHE CONDESCENDED TO EAT--THEY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER TOO IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION BUT IT WAS WITH A RESERVE THAT APPEARED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN QUARRELLING AND FELT SO TO THEMSELVES THOUGH NO SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE HAD HAPPENED
AND THOUGH I DO NOT GIVE YOU THE HOPE THAT I SHALL NOT CENSURE YOUR FOLLY I WILL AT LEAST NOT REPROACH YOU FOR HAVING AT FIRST DENIED IT TO REPEAT THESE WORDS IN WRITING THE READER MUST CONDEMN THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE COULD HESITATE TO OWN HE LOVED IF HE WAS EVEN AFRAID TO NAME THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION
AT THE USUAL HOUR MR DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA:--HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER
THE CONVERSATION WAS CHANGED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND EARLY IN THE EVENING THE PARTY FROM MILNER LODGE RETURNED HOME
WHILE THE HORROR OF DOMESTIC WRANGLES--A FAMILY WITHOUT SUBORDINATION--A HOUSE WITHOUT OECONOMY--IN A WORD A WIFE WITHOUT DISCRETION HAD BEEN PERPETUALLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
SHE LOVED HIM AS HER FRIEND HER COUSIN HER FOSTER-BROTHER BUT NOT AS A LOVER
HER LITTLE HEART EMPLOYED IN ALL THE ENDLESS PURSUITS OF PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAD LEFT HER MIND WITHOUT ONE ORNAMENT EXCEPT SUCH AS NATURE GAVE
MRS HORTON AND MISS FENTON WHO WERE SITTING TOGETHER EXPATIATING ON THE DUPLICITY OF THEIR OWN SEX IN THE INSTANCE JUST BEFORE THEM HAD NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTEREST OF THE DISCOURSE A LONGING DESIRE TO BREAK IT OFF
AND BEFORE HIM SHE WAS UNDER SOME RESTRICTION
PARTED WITH HER AS SHE THOUGHT FOR EVER WITH ALL THE AGONIES WITH WHICH MOTHERS PART FROM THEIR INFANT CHILDREN
AS TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT HAS MADE IMPRESSION ENOUGH ON MY MEMORY TO ENABLE ME TO REPEAT IT I AM GLAD IT HAS NOT AND MY ANSWER TO YOUR UNCLE IS TO BE SIMPLY THAT YOU WILL NOT OBEY HIM I SHOULD HOPE MR SANDFORD THAT YOU WOULD EXPRESS IT IN BETTER TERMS TELL ME THE TERMS AND I WILL BE EXACT RUSHBROOK STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM
SANDFORD WALKED ON SOME PACES BEFORE AND TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE AS HE WENT BY HIM THAN JUST TOUCHING THE FORE PART OF HIS HAT WITH HIS FINGER
ONE OF THEM WAS TO TAKE EVERY PARTICLE OF POWDER OUT OF HER HAIR AND HAVE IT CURLED ALL OVER IN FALLING RINGLETS
MISS WOODLEY ADMIRED THIS DRESS YET OBJECTED TO IT
OH HEAVENS EXCLAIMED MATILDA CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER AND THE TEARS FALLING STILL FASTER
BUT NEVER DURING ALL THIS TIME DID HIS EYE ONCE ENCOUNTER MISS WOODLEY'S
ONE OF HER FRIENDS WAS WILLIAM GODWIN WHO DESCRIBED HER TO MRS SHELLEY AS A PIQUANTE MIXTURE BETWEEN A LADY AND A MILKMAID AND WHO IT IS SAID SUGGESTED PART OF THE PLOT OF A SIMPLE STORY BUT SHE QUARRELED WITH HIM WHEN HE MARRIED MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT AFTER WHOSE DEATH SHE WROTE TO HIM THUS--"WITH THE MOST SINCERE SYMPATHY IN ALL YOU HAVE SUFFERED--WITH THE MOST PERFECT FORGIVENESS OF ALL YOU HAVE SAID TO ME THERE MUST NEVERTHELESS BE AN END TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE FOR EVER I RESPECT YOUR PREJUDICES BUT I ALSO RESPECT MY OWN FAR MORE INTIMATE WERE HER RELATIONS WITH DR GISBORNE--A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE WITH WHOM IN SOME TRAGIC MANNER THAT WE CAN ONLY JUST DISCERN WAS ENACTED HER FINAL ROMANCE
HE WAS AFFECTED BY HER GRIEF
OUTSIDE OF IT HER POWERS ARE WEAK AND FLUCTUATING
NAME THE PERSON IF THERE IS ANY ON WHOM YOU HAVE BESTOWED YOUR HEART
I LOVED MY DECEASED LADY--I LOVE MY LORD--AND I LOVE THEIR CHILD--NAY SO I AM SURE DOES MY LORD HIMSELF
LORD FREDERICK ON FIRST SEEING HER WAS STRUCK WITH HER BEAUTY AND MISS MILNER APPREHENDED SHE HAD INTRODUCED A RIVAL
SHE HAD BEHAVED WITH FORTITUDE THE WHOLE EVENING AND SHE CONTINUED TO DO SO TILL THE MOMENT HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER
WHILE THE AGITATION OF HIS OWN MIND WAS TOO GREAT TO OBSERVE THE RIGOUR OF THIS SENTENCE ON HIS NEPHEW
AND WITH A GENTLENESS THAT DWELT UPON HIS MEMORY BEYOND ALL HER OTHER ENDOWMENTS
FOR SHE FELT A PRESENTIMENT THAT HER GUARDIAN WAS GOING TO UPBRAID HER AND HER HEART WHISPERED THAT HE HAD NEVER YET REPROACHED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE
A REPLY TO THIS FORMAL ADDRESS WAS A REWARD HE WISHED FOR WITH IMPATIENCE BUT HE WISHED IN VAIN
SHE HAD WAITED BY HIS SIDE AND WITH EVERY GOOD PURPOSE HAD PREACHED PATIENCE TO HIM WHILE HE WAS SMARTING UNDER THE PAIN BUT MORE UNDER THE SHAME OF HIS CHASTISEMENT
AND AS MISS WOODLEY HAS DISAPPOINTED ME I MUST HAVE YOUR COMPANY SANDFORD NOW LAID HIS BOOK DOWN UPON THE TABLE
AND MEEKLY SAID TO LORD ELMWOOD HE IS BUT A BOY MY LORD AND DO NOT GIVE HIM THE PUNISHMENT OF A MAN RUSHBROOK NOW SNATCHED HIS HAND FROM SANDFORD'S AND THREW IT WITH HIMSELF UPON HIS NECK
UPON WHICH DORRIFORTH TOOK THE RESOLUTION OF SEEKING ANOTHER SECOND
BUT TO A RELIGIOUS MIND WHAT SOUND IS SO HORRIBLE AS SACRILEGE OF VOWS MADE TO GOD OR TO MAN THE FORMER MUST WEIGH THE HEAVIEST
MRS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF-APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
LORD ELMWOOD AS HE ADVANCED TO THE TABLE BOWED NOT HAVING SEEN THE LADIES SINCE THE MORNING OR MISS MILNER THAT DAY
SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED OF THE PLEASURE SHE EXPECTED IN DINING WITH HIM
SANDFORD WAS PRESENT
SOON AFTER THE DINNER WAS REMOVED LORD ELMWOOD ENTERED
AT ITS CONCLUSION THE TEARS FLOWED FAST DOWN HIS FACE
IT IS THE SENTENCE NOT OF A SPEAKER BUT OF A WRITER
HE PERCEIVED HER FEARS AND REPLIED NAY IF YOU STAY SO SHALL I--AND WHEN I GO I SHALL TAKE YOU ALONG WITH ME TO MY HOUSE TO ELMWOOD HOUSE SHE ASKED EAGERLY
YOUR LORDSHIP IS TALKING REPLIED SANDFORD OF THE PASSION IN ITS MOST REFINED AND PREDOMINANT SENSE
EVERY ONE HAS HEARD OF FANNY BURNEY'S NOVELS AND EVELINA IS STILL WIDELY READ
LORD ELMWOOD WENT HOWEVER EARLIER TO BED THAN ORDINARY OR RATHER TO HIS BED-CHAMBER
WHEN SHE HAD DESCENDED A FEW STAIRS SHE HEARD A FOOTSTEP WALKING SLOWLY UP
NEITHER MISS MILNER NOR MISS WOODLEY ANSWERED
NAY DO NOT LET ME ADD TO YOUR UNEASINESS HE RESUMED WHILE I AM ATTEMPTING TO ALLEVIATE IT
IT SEEMED BUT A VERY SHORT TIME THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST WHEN THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO TAKE LORD ELMWOOD AWAY DROVE TO THE DOOR
SHE CAUGHT HIS PIERCING EYES--HER'S WERE IMMEDIATELY CAST DOWN
FOR YESTERDAY WHEN I AM CONFIDENT HE KNEW THAT MR SANDFORD HAD BEEN TO SEE YOU HE RECEIVED HIM ON HIS RETURN WITH UNUSUAL MARKS OF KINDNESS DID HE SAID SHE--AND AGAIN SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD
SHE THEREFORE LISTENED SHE TALKED AND EVEN SMILED WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY NOR DID THEIR VIVACITY SEEM TO ARISE FROM A MUCH LESS COMPULSIVE SOURCE THAN HER OWN
AND AS SUCH WHOEVER HAS IT HAS A RIGHT TO IT IN THIS MANNER SHE WOULD PLEAD THE YOUNG MAN'S EXCUSE--PERHAPS BUT TO HEAR WHAT COULD BE SAID IN HIS DISFAVOUR FOR SECRETLY HIS NAME WAS BITTER TO HER--AND ONCE SHE EXCLAIMED IN VEXATION ON SANDFORD'S SAYING LORD ELMWOOD AND MR RUSHBROOK WERE GONE OUT SHOOTING TOGETHER ALL THAT PLEASURE IS NOW ECLIPSED WHICH I USED TO TAKE IN LISTENING TO THE REPORT OF MY FATHER'S GUN FOR I CANNOT NOW DISTINGUISH HIS FROM HIS PARASITE'S SANDFORD MUCH AS HE DISLIKED RUSHBROOK FOR THIS EXPRESSION WHICH COMPRISED HER FATHER IN THE REFLECTION TURNED TO MATILDA IN EXTREME ANGER--BUT AS HE SAW THE COLOUR MOUNT INTO HER FACE FOR WHAT IN THE STRONG FEELINGS OF HER HEART HAD ESCAPED HER LIPS HE DID NOT SAY A WORD--AND BY HER TEARS THAT FOLLOWED HE REJOICED TO SEE HOW MUCH SHE REPROVED HERSELF MISS WOODLEY VEXED TO THE HEART AND PROVOKED EVERY TIME SHE SAW LORD ELMWOOD AND RUSHBROOK TOGETHER AND SAW THE FAMILIAR TERMS ON WHICH THIS YOUNG MAN
NOR DID SHE SUPPOSE IF SHE NEVER WENT HE WOULD EVER ASK FOR HER
BUT MY DEAR MISS MILNER LET NOT THIS ALARM YOU
BUT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR HIS RESOLUTIONS OR FOR THE ALTERATION HIS DISPOSITION HAS LATELY UNDERGONE
AFTER LISTENING WITH ANXIETY AND WITH JOY TO ALL SHE TOLD MATILDA LAID HOLD OF THAT HAND WHICH SHE SAID LORD ELMWOOD HAD HELD AND PRESSED IT TO HER LIPS WITH LOVE AND REVERENCE
IN SPITE OF YOUR ELOQUENT PEN SHE WROTE TO HIM WITH A TOUCH OF THAT SHARP AND ALMOST BITTER SENSE THAT WAS ALWAYS HERS MATRIMONY STILL APPEARS TO ME WITH LESS CHARMS THAN TERRORS
BUT HER SUPERIOR SOUL APPEARED ABOVE THOSE EMOTIONS AND THERE WAS MORE INDUCEMENT TO WORSHIP HER AS A SAINT THAN TO LOVE HER AS A WOMAN
AT LEAST THIS WAS THE HAPPY MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH HER SELF-COMPLACENT MIND BEGAN TO SEE HIM
SOMETHING ESSENTIAL SAID HE TO HIMSELF MUST BE CONSIDERED--SOMETHING TO PREPARE HER FOR AN HOUR LIKE THIS
ONE MORNING HOWEVER AS HE WAS ATTENDING HIM IN THE LIBRARY HENRY,"----SAID HIS UNCLE WITH A PAUSE AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS SPEECH WHICH INDICATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE HENRY----YOU HAVE NOT FORGOT THE DISCOURSE I HAD WITH YOU A LITTLE TIME PREVIOUS TO YOUR ILLNESS HENRY HESITATED--FOR HE WISHED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT--BUT IT WAS TOO STRONGLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MEMORY
AND HE MEANT ALSO TO VENTURE AT THE SAME TIME TO KEEP THE PROMISE HE HAD MADE TO HIS DYING LADY--BUT THE NEWS REACHED HIS LORDSHIP BEFORE SANDFORD ARRIVED
I HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND EXPLICIT IN ALL I HAVE SAID
WITH ALL MY HEART SANDFORD AND THEY BOTH WENT OUT TOGETHER BEFORE MISS MILNER RETURNED TO THE APARTMENT
RUSHBROOK WAS OFFICIOUSLY POLITE FOR THAT WAS THE EPITHET SHE GAVE HIS ATTENTION IN RELATING IT TO LADY MATILDA YET SHE OWNED HE HAD NOT THAT FORWARD IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD FORMERLY DISCOVERED IN HIM BUT APPEARED MUCH MORE GRAVE AND SEDATE
DORRIFORTH BEHELD THE DIFFICULTY SHE HAD IN SUSTAINING HERSELF AND WITH THE UTMOST TENDERNESS WENT TOWARDS HER AND SUPPORTING HER SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON--I INVITED YOU HITHER WITH A FAR DIFFERENT INTENTION THAN YOUR UNEASINESS AND BE ASSURED SANDFORD WAS BEGINNING TO SPEAK WHEN DORRIFORTH RESUMED,--"HOLD MR SANDFORD THE LADY IS UNDER MY PROTECTION AND I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT IS NOT REQUISITE THAT YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER AND TO ME FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID YOU ASKED MY OPINION OR I HAD NOT GIVEN IT YOU--WOULD YOU HAVE ME LIKE HER SPEAK WHAT I DO NOT THINK SAY NO MORE SIR CRIED DORRIFORTH--AND LEADING HER KINDLY TO THE DOOR AS IF TO DEFEND HER FROM HIS MALICE TOLD HER HE WOULD TAKE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RENEWING THE SUBJECT CHAPTER XVII
AS HE DARED NOT TOUCH UPON ANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE WAS THE MOST INTERESTED THIS JOINED TO THE RESPECT HE WISHED TO PAY THE LADY TO WHOM HE WROTE LIMITED HIS LETTER TO ABOUT TWENTY LINES
GOOD MORNING LADIES SAID LORD ELMWOOD RISING TO GO AWAY
WEDLOCK WAS NOT THE PLAN WHICH LORD MARGRAVE HAD EVER PROPOSED TO HIMSELF FOR HAPPINESS
YOU MAY DO AN INJURY TO THE VERY PERSON YOU ARE SEEKING TO BEFRIEND--THE VERY MAINTENANCE I MEAN TO ALLOW HER DAUGHTER I CAN WITHDRAW POOR SANDFORD ALL ALARMED AT THIS MENACE REPLIED WITH ENERGY MY LORD UNLESS YOU BEGIN THE SUBJECT I NEVER SHALL PRESUME TO MENTION IT AGAIN I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT BUT OF THAT ALONE WE ARE FRIENDS
PERHAPS FOR US THE MOST MEMORABLE FACT ABOUT MRS INCHBALD'S DRAMATIC WORK IS THAT ONE OF HER ADAPTATIONS FROM THE GERMAN OF KOTZEBUE WAS NO OTHER THAN THAT LOVERS VOWS WHICH AS EVERY ONE KNOWS WAS REHEARSED SO BRILLIANTLY AT ECCLESFORD THE SEAT OF THE RIGHT HON
WHEN SHE HAD--"THERE HE HELD ME IN HIS ARMS SAID SHE AND I THOUGHT I FELT HIM PRESS ME TO HIS HEART BUT I NOW FIND I WAS MISTAKEN AS SANDFORD CAME FORWARD TO HAND HER INTO THE COACH NOW YOU BEHAVE WELL SAID HE BY THIS BEHAVIOUR YOU DO NOT ENTIRELY CLOSE ALL PROSPECT OF RECONCILIATION WITH YOUR FATHER DO YOU THINK IT IS NOT YET IMPOSSIBLE CRIED SHE CLASPING HIS HAND
FRIGHTFUL SUPERSTITIONS STRUCK HER TO THE HEART AND SHE COULD SCARCELY PREVENT FALLING DOWN UNDER THEIR OPPRESSION
IT WAS AN ENTERPRISE IN WHICH HE SUCCEEDED WITH MISS MILNER EVEN BEYOND HIS MOST SANGUINE WISH
IN THE EVENING NO LONGER ABLE TO SUPPORT THE SUSPENSE INTO WHICH HE WAS THROWN
AFTER KNOWING HIS I NEVER SOUGHT ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANOTHER--I DID NOT WISH TO LESSEN THE EXALTED ESTIMATION OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH HE HAD INSPIRED
TILL YOUR RELIGIOUS PRECEPTS REFORMED IT
YOU HAVE POWER TO ACT IN REGARD TO THE PERSONS YOU HAVE MENTIONED
DURING WHICH HE CAREFULLY AVOIDED EXCHANGING A WORD WITH HIM AND GAVE EVERY OTHER DEMONSTRATION OF HIS ANGER
HER WORDS WERE BUT THE WORDS OF OTHERS AND LIKE THOSE OF OTHERS PUT INTO COMMON SENTENCES
DURING THE FEW DAYS THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN HER OPEN CONFESSION OF A PASSION FOR LORD FREDERICK AND THIS PROPOSED PLAN OF SEPARATION THE MOST INTRICATE INCOHERENCE APPEARED IN THE CHARACTER OF MISS MILNER--AND IN ORDER TO EVADE A MARRIAGE WITH HIM AND CONCEAL AT THE SAME TIME THE SHAMEFUL PROPENSITY WHICH LURKED IN HER BREAST SHE WAS ONCE EVEN ON THE POINT OF DECLARING A PASSION FOR SIR EDWARD ASHTON
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY WITH WHAT DELIGHT SANDFORD WAS RECEIVED BY MISS WOODLEY AND THE HAPLESS DAUGHTER OF LADY ELMWOOD EVEN BEFORE HE TOLD HIS ERRAND
NO YOU CANNOT--FOR YOU KNOW YOU DO THINK OF ME AND YOU KNOW YOU HATE ME."--HERE HE DRANK TWO GLASSES OF WINE ONE AFTER ANOTHER
WHICH I CALL NO QUALIFICATION SAID DORRIFORTH RISING FROM HIS CHAIR IN EVIDENT UNEASINESS
MISS WOODLEY NOW ASKED RUSHBROOK TO SIT--FOR TILL NOW SHE HAD NOT
AND FOR BEING HONOURED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF HER FATHER SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH REVERENCE
BUT NOW THE APPEARANCE OF A STRANGER WHOM SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
ENCOURAGED BY THIS SUPPOSITION SANDFORD SAID MY LORD WON'T YOU CONDESCEND TO TAKE YOUR LEAVE OF MISS WOODLEY CERTAINLY SANDFORD REPLIED HE AND SEEMED GLAD OF AN EXCUSE TO SIT DOWN AGAIN
IT WAS HIS INTENTION WHEN HE FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH LORD ELMWOOD'S RESOLUTION TO QUIT HIS HOUSE
YET AGAIN HE FELT ALL THE AWKWARDNESS OF HIS OWN SITUATION
A COMPLIMENT PAID BY HERSELF TO YOU SIR REPLIED LORD FREDERICK HAS AFFECTED YOUR WARD IN THE MANNER YOU HAVE SEEN AS IF SHE BLUSHED AT THE UNTRUTH SAID DORRIFORTH
YET SHE HAD THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THOSE VAGUE HOPES FROM HIS CHILD LEST A DISAPPOINTMENT MIGHT PROVE FATAL
IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CENTURY SHE GRADUALLY WITHDREW FROM LONDON ESTABLISHING HERSELF IN SUBURBAN BOARDING-HOUSES OFTEN AMONG SISTERS OF CHARITY AND DEVOTING HER DAYS TO THE PRACTICE OF HER RELIGION
THE REFLECTIONS OF DORRIFORTH WERE LESS AGREEABLY ENGAGED--CARES DOUBTS FEARS POSSESSED HIS MIND--AND SO FORCIBLY POSSESSED IT THAT UPON EVERY OCCASION WHICH OFFERED HE WOULD INQUISITIVELY ENDEAVOUR TO GAIN INTELLIGENCE OF HIS WARD'S DISPOSITION BEFORE HE SAW HER
FOR GENUINE LOVE WILL MAKE HIM HAPPY IN BANISHMENT IN POVERTY OR IN SICKNESS
BUT THAT IF TIME OR CHANCE SHOULD HAPPILY MAKE AN ALTERATION IN HIS LORD'S DISPOSITION HE WOULD BE THE FIRST WHO WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO REPLACE HIM.--EDWARDS WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
IN THE BREAKFAST AND DINING ROOMS SHE LEANED OVER THOSE SEATS WITH A KIND OF FILIAL PIETY ON WHICH SHE WAS TOLD HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SIT
FOR PRUDENCE HE CALLED IT NOT TO REMIND HIMSELF OF HAPPINESS HE COULD NEVER TASTE AGAIN AND OF INGRATITUDE THAT MIGHT IMPEL HIM TO HATRED
THIS PIOUS CEREMONY MISS MILNER BY CHANCE OBSERVED AND NOW SHEWED SUCH AN EVIDENT PROPENSITY TO BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER THAT THE GOOD LADY OF THE HOUSE COULD NO LONGER CONTAIN HER RESENTMENT BUT EXCLAIMED GOD FORGIVE YOU WITH A SEVERITY SO DIFFERENT FROM THE IDEA WHICH THE WORDS CONVEYED THAT THE OBJECT OF HER ANGER WAS ON THIS OBLIGED FREELY TO INDULGE THAT IMPULSE WHICH SHE HAD IN VAIN BEEN STRUGGLING TO SUPPRESS
AND FOR YOUR SAKE I WILL BEAR ALL WITH PATIENCE--I WILL NOT GROAN I WILL NOT EVEN SIGH AGAIN--THIS TASK I SET MYSELF TO ATONE FOR WHAT I HAVE DARED TO UTTER WHILE LADY MATILDA LABOURED UNDER THIS VARIETY OF SENSATIONS MISS WOODLEY WAS OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING AND ENDEAVOURING TO CALM HER SORROWS--AND LORD ELMWOOD WITH RUSHBROOK WAS READY TO SET OFF
BUT UPON THE TEST THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE--HE HAD CAUGHT HIM SO MUSING MANY A TIME BEFORE
MY LORD DO NOT LEAVE HER IN THIS SORROW--PITY HER WEAKNESS AND FORGIVE IT SHE WAS PROCEEDING
BUT THE MORNING CAME AND HE FOUND ALL HIS PRYING CURIOSITY WAS OF NO AVAIL
MATILDA SOON AFTER SHE WAS PLACED IN THE CARRIAGE WITH LORD ELMWOOD DROPPED FAST ASLEEP
RUSHBROOK ON HIS PART WAS PLEASED WITH THE ASSURANCE HE MIGHT SPEAK WHEN HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
BUT HER TREATMENT OF IT HAS VERY LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HIS METHOD OF MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS AND VAST ACCUMULATION
THE BLOOD MOUNTED TO EVERY PART OF HER SKIN THAT WAS VISIBLE FOR NOT A FIBRE BUT FELT THE SECRET TRANSPORT THAT DORRIFORTH THOUGHT HER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE BEAUTIFUL MISS FENTON
NO YET THE LOVE WHICH IS THE RESULT OF GRATITUDE AND PITY ONLY HE THOUGHT HAD LITTLE CLAIM TO RANK WITH HIS
BUT THE BEAUTY OF LUCIFER CONTINUED SANDFORD IN PERFECT NEGLECT AND CONTEMPT OF HER QUESTION WAS AN AGGRAVATION OF HIS GUILT
AND SO FAR FROM ITS BEING WHAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED SHE HAS GREAT VIVACITY
BUT IT IS A GRATIFICATION I WILL NOT INDULGE YOU WITH--THEREFORE SAY ANOTHER SENTENCE ON THE SUBJECT AND RISING FROM HIS SEAT I'LL LEAVE THE ROOM AND NEVER COME INTO YOUR COMPANY AGAIN WHATEVER YOUR UNCLE MAY SAY TO IT RUSHBROOK SAW BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HIS COUNTENANCE HE WAS SERIOUS AND POSITIVELY ASSURED HIM HE WOULD NEVER THANK HIM MORE
I AM A VERY UNFORTUNATE MAN SAID HE AS SOON AS THE SERVANT WAS GONE WHO BROUGHT THE MESSAGE
HER FRIEND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH LOVE ONLY BY NAME
THE DECEASED MR MILNER ON HIS APPROACHING DISSOLUTION PERFECTLY SENSIBLE OF HIS STATE THUS REASONED WITH HIMSELF BEFORE HE MADE THE NOMINATION:--"I HAVE FORMED NO INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP DURING MY WHOLE LIFE EXCEPT ONE--I CAN BE SAID TO KNOW THE HEART OF NO MAN EXCEPT THE HEART OF DORRIFORTH
BUT THE EXCESS OF HIS LOVE ON THIS NEW OCCASION SUBDUED ALL THE RESOLUTIONS HE HAD FORMED AGAINST THE MARRIED STATE
AND I WILL STAY WITH HIM AGAIN THE STEWARD SENT TO LET THEM KNOW THE COACH WAS WAITING
RUSHBROOK NOW FOUND HIMSELF IN THAT PERILOUS STATE THAT ADMITTED OF NO MEDIUM OF RESENTMENT BUT BY SUCH DASTARDLY CONDUCT ON HIS PART AS WOULD WOUND BOTH HIS TRUTH AND COURAGE
AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH HIS LOOKS HAD ONCE GIVEN HIM NOW FLED FROM HIS FACE
WHILE THIS RIGID ACT WAS EXECUTING BY LORD ELMWOOD'S AGENTS AT HIS COMMAND HIMSELF WAS ENGAGED IN AN AFFAIR OF STILL WEIGHTIER IMPORTANCE--THAT OF LIFE OR DEATH:--HE DETERMINED UPON HIS OWN DEATH OR THE DEATH OF THE MAN WHO HAD WOUNDED HIS HONOUR AND DESTROYED HIS HAPPINESS
BUT THE VISCOUNT WAS MUCH MORE AFFECTED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
BUT SENT IN THEIR DISGUISE NECESSITY WHO BEING THE MOTHER OF INVENTION GAVE ME ALL MINE--WHILE FORTUNE KINDLY SMILED AND WAS ACCESSORY TO THE CHEAT
HER GRATITUDE WAS EXPRESSED IN BLUSHES AND BY ASSURING HIM SHE WAS NOW SO WELL AS TO SUP ON THE DISHES BEFORE HER SHE SPOKE HOWEVER AND HAD NOT MADE THE TRIAL
TOO HAPPY AT THIS TIME TO SUFFER A MORTIFICATION FROM ANY INDIGNITIES HE MIGHT RECEIVE HE SENT HIS SERVANT TO HIM INTO HIS STUDY AS SOON AS HE WAS RETURNED HOME TO BEG TO KNOW IF HE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO WAIT UPON HIM WITH A MESSAGE HE HAD TO DELIVER FROM LORD ELMWOOD THE SERVANT RETURNED--"MR SANDFORD DESIRED HE WOULD SEND THE MESSAGE BY HIM OR THE HOUSE-STEWARD THIS WAS HIGHLY AFFRONTING
WHO I MY LORD
EDUCATED IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY AND INURED TO RETIREMENT FROM HER INFANCY SHE HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR ALL THOSE AMUSEMENTS WHICH A RECLUSE LIFE AFFORDS
BUT I SAID NOTHING TO WARRANT ANY IMPROPER PETITION ITS IMPROPRIETY WAS NOT NAMED MY LORD NO MATTER--THAT YOU MUST JUDGE OF AND ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I WOULD ANSWER WITH MY LIFE WILLINGLY--BUT I OWN THAT I SHRINK FROM YOUR ANGER THEN DO NOT PROVOKE IT I HAVE ALREADY GONE TOO FAR TO RECEDE--AND YOU WOULD OF COURSE DEMAND AN EXPLANATION IF I ATTEMPTED TO STOP HERE I SHOULD THEN MY LORD I AM BOUND TO SPEAK--BUT DO NOT INTERRUPT ME--HEAR ME OUT BEFORE YOU BANISH ME FROM YOUR PRESENCE FOR EVER I WILL SIR REPLIED HE PREPARED TO HEAR SOMETHING THAT WOULD DISPLEASE HIM AND YET DETERMINED TO HEAR WITH PATIENCE TO THE CONCLUSION
THEREFORE ALL FUTURE EXPLANATION IS UNNECESSARY--NOR WILL I PERMIT A WORD OR A HINT ON THE SUBJECT FROM ANY ONE WITHOUT SHEWING MY RESENTMENT EVEN TO THE HOUR OF MY DEATH HE WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST NOW HEARD ME SAY IS ALL A FALSEHOOD HOW MISS MILNER OH MISS WOODLEY RETURNED SHE SOBBING UPON HER BOSOM PITY THE AGONIES OF MY HEART MY HEART BY NATURE SINCERE WHEN SUCH ARE THE FATAL PROPENSITIES IT CHERISHES THAT I MUST SUBMIT TO THE GROSSEST FALSEHOODS RATHER THAN REVEAL THE TRUTH WHAT CAN YOU MEAN CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH THE STRONGEST AMAZEMENT IN HER FACE
BUT WITHOUT ALLOWING ME A JUDGE AT ALL I WILL APPEAL TO THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT WITH ME ARE MRS HORTON AND MR SANDFORD TO BE THE CONNOISSEURS NO
WHEN RUSHBROOK'S VALET CAME TO ATTEND HIS MASTER HE SAID TO HIM I SUPPOSE SIR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED AT THE CASTLE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WHAT CRIED RUSHBROOK
I HAVE STOLEN A WOMAN CERTAINLY SAID HE TO HIMSELF BUT I WILL MAKE HER HAPPIER THAN SHE WAS IN THAT HUMBLE STATE FROM WHICH I HAVE TAKEN HER
AND IT IS PROPER THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO WHOM DORRIFORTH THOUGHT HE DID KNOW AND MENTIONED LORD FREDERICK
SANDFORD'S CHARITY DID NOT EXTEND THUS FAR
REPLY SIR TO THAT QUESTION SHE SAID
MISS WOODLEY CONTINUED WITH HER FRIEND TILL SHE SAW HER ENTIRELY REINSTATED IN HER HEALTH
IT MAY GIVE MR DORRIFORTH A CLEARER KNOWLEDGE WHAT MEANS ARE PROPER TO CONVERT HER FROM EVIL BUT MY DEAR MADAM SHE MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE EVIL OF DISOBEDIENCE
HIS ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY HER DEADLY COUNTENANCE AND HE LOOKED EARNESTLY
AND WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT AFTER LORD ELMWOOD HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK IN HER FACE AND TURNED IT WITH SOME MARKS OF APPREHENSION FOR THE GRIEF HE MIGHT FIND THERE
HE SAW ALL THE DANGERS OF THIS UNDERTAKING BUT NONE APPEARED SO GREAT AS THE DANGER OF LOSING HER HE LOVED BY THE INFLUENCE OF A RIVAL--AND THOUGH SANDFORD HAD NAMED INSOLENCE HE WAS IN DOUBT WHETHER WHAT HAD APPEARED SO TO HIM WAS SO IN REALITY OR WOULD BE SO CONSIDERED BY HER
L
L
REFLECT UPON ALL THE DAYS OF MY PAST LIFE--THE ANXIOUS MOMENTS I HAVE KNOWN AND WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR END
AND YET IMPELLED BY THAT INSTINCTIVE POWER WHICH ACTUATES A PARENT LADY ELMWOOD ON HER DYING DAY HAS NO WORLDLY THOUGHTS BUT THAT OF THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF AN ONLY CHILD
HE KNEW THE LIFE MISS MILNER HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD
WHILE HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY CHILD BY HIS ONCE ADORED MISS MILNER HE REFUSES EVER TO SEE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE TO HER MOTHER'S CRIMES
LORD MARGRAVE REPLIED THE STRANGER WE HAVE NO DOUBT HAS FORMED THIS PLOT--HE HAS FOR SOME TIME PAST BESET THE HOUSE WHERE SHE LIVED
ON THE EVENING OF THE NEXT DAY IT WAS TO BE--SHE WAS UP EARLY BREAKFASTED IN HER DRESSING ROOM AND REMAINED THERE MOST OF THE DAY BUSIED IN A THOUSAND PREPARATIONS FOR THE NIGHT
BUT TO WHICH SHE HAD NO REAL PRETENSIONS ALTHOUGH THE MOST DISCERNING CRITIC HEARING HER CONVERSE MIGHT FALL INTO THIS MISTAKE
ON WHICH THE POOR MAN WHO LIKE THE CHARACTER HE REPRESENTED HAD BEEN HALF STARVED BEFORE BEGAN TO LIVE SO COMFORTABLY HE BECAME TOO PLUMP FOR THE PART
SANDFORD WAS SOON JOINED BY THE LADIES
IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME--SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
TURNING BACK FREQUENTLY AND SPEAKING TO SANDFORD OR TO SOME OTHER PERSON WHO WAS BEHIND HIM AS IF PART OF HIS THOUGHTS WERE LEFT BEHIND AND HE WENT WITH RELUCTANCE
MISS WOODLEY YOU DON'T BEHAVE SO KINDLY TO ME AS YOU USED TO DO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SIR SHE REPLIED VERY GRAVELY
BUT RECOLLECTING HIMSELF MY LORD I WILL OBEY YOUR COMMANDS WHATEVER THEY ARE AND SEIZING HER HAND PULLED IT WITH VIOLENCE--IT FELL--AND HER FATHER WENT AWAY
IT WAS THE MOTHER OF LADY MATILDA CONTINUED RUSHBROOK WHO WAS THIS FRIEND TO ME
I HERE CONTINUED THE EARL TOLERATE THE FIRST UNTRUTH YOU EVER TOLD ME AS THE FALSE ASSERTION OF A LOVER
DORRIFORTH WAS AFFECTED AT THE DESCRIPTION AND SANDFORD URGED MORE THAN EVER THE NECESSITY OF LEAVING TOWN
WAS THERE NOTHING EQUIVOCAL ON WHICH HE MAY GROUND HIS DISPLEASURE SHOULD HE BE TOLD THAT I AM HERE
ACCOMPANYING THE RECITAL WITH HER USUAL TESTIMONIES OF SYMPATHY AND AFFECTION
DID NOT YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD COME IF I HAD I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE COME RETURNED HE BUT I ONLY SAID SO CONDITIONALLY THAT I AM A WITNESS TO CRIED SANDFORD FOR I WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME AND HE SAID IT SHOULD DEPEND UPON MISS FENTON AND SHE WITH HER GLOOMY DISPOSITION SAID MISS MILNER CHOSE TO SIT AT HOME GLOOMY DISPOSITION REPEATED SANDFORD
WHILE EVEN THE GRAVE SANDFORD SMILED AT THE IDEA OF THEIR MEETING
AND WHAT ADDED POIGNANTLY TO HIS CONCERN WAS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUPPLANTED BY MISS MILNER
AS HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME LESS SOUR RUSHBROOK FELL FROM SOME GENERAL TOPICS HE HAD EAGERLY STARTED IN ORDER TO APPEASE HIM AND SAID HOW HARD IS IT TO RESTRAIN CONVERSATION FROM THE SUBJECT OF OUR THOUGHTS
A LOVER OF LADY MATILDA'S REPLIED SANDFORD
HERE UPON MR DORRIFORTH'S RETURN FROM HIS JOURNEY PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE RECEPTION OF HIS WARD
MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD INTERRUPTING HIM WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED IN THE MOST FERVENT SUPPLICATION--"OH
HE NOW PRESSED HER TO TAKE ONE GLASS OF WINE WITH SUCH SOLICITUDE THAT HE SEEMED TO SAY A THOUSAND THINGS BESIDES
BUT ALTHOUGH SHE FELT THUS TRANQUIL IN RESPECT TO WHAT SHE HAD DIVULGED YET SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL EMBARRASSED WITH THE DREAD OF NEXT SEEING LORD ELMWOOD
IN SPITE OF THE PROPENSITY HE FELT TO PASS SO NEAR TO MATILDA COULD HE HAVE KNOWN WHAT CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED THE MOST RESPECTFUL WHATEVER PAINFUL DENIAL IT HAD COST HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE ADOPTED
LIVED WITH HIS BENEFACTOR NOW MADE HER VISITS TO HIM VERY SELDOM
ABOUT NINE IN THE EVENING SANDFORD RANG AT THE BELL AND WAS ADMITTED--NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WELCOME--MATILDA HUNG UPON HIM AS IF HIS RECENT INTERVIEW WITH HER FATHER HAD ENDEARED HIM TO HER MORE THAN EVER
MATILDA WHO HEARD AND SAW SOME PART OF THIS FESTIVITY FROM HER WINDOWS INQUIRED THE CAUSE
AMONGST HER UNPARDONABLE INDISCRETIONS DURING THIS TRIAL UPON THE TEMPER OF HER GUARDIAN WAS THE FREQUENT MENTION OF MANY GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN HER PROFESSED ADMIRERS AND THE MENTION OF THEM WITH PARTIALITY
HOLDS HER TO HER BOSOM
YET AS SOON AS HIS REASON AND AFFECTIONS HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO BREAK WITH MISS FENTON AND MARRY HIS WARD HE BECAME SO DECIDEDLY OF THIS OPINION THAT SANDFORD'S NEVER HAD THE MOST TRIVIAL WEIGHT
I WILL FAITHFULLY PERFORM IT THOUGH MISS MILNER WAS CONSCIOUS THIS DECLARATION COULD NOT IN DELICACY BE EVER ADDUCED AGAINST HIM
SHE WRUNG HER HANDS AND LIFTED UP HER EYES TO HEAVEN IN THE LAST AGONY OF DESPAIR WHEN ONE OF LORD MARGRAVE'S SERVANTS ENTERED HASTILY AND ANNOUNCED LORD ELMWOOD THAT MOMENT HER FATHER ENTERED--AND WITH ALL THE UNRESTRAINED FONDNESS OF A PARENT FOLDED HER IN HIS ARMS
SANDFORD HAD STILL MISS MILNER'S HAND FIXED UPON HIS
MISS WOODLEY IS SEVERE UPON ME MADAM CONTINUED HE SHE JUDGES ME UNKINDLY
BUT THOUGH MISS MILNER ACQUIESCED IN THIS OPINION YET SHE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO FORM THE DETERMINATION THAT SHE WOULD GO
THAT UPON EVERY OCCURRENCE IN LIFE THERE IS A HEART SO DEVOTED TO ALL SHE FEELS THAT SHE NEVER CAN SUFFER WITHOUT THE SYMPATHY OF ANOTHER
MISS WOODLEY AT LENGTH YIELDED THUS FAR THAT AS SOON AS LORD ELMWOOD WAS SET OUT ON HIS JOURNEY TO ITALY WHERE SHE HAD HEARD HIM SAY THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE OBLIGED TO GO SHE WOULD NO LONGER DENY HER THE PLEASURE OF RETURNING
SHE DESIRED ME SAID SANDFORD STILL PRESENTING THE LETTER TO CONJURE YOU TO READ IT FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE LORD ELMWOOD TOOK IT INSTANTLY
IF SHE SAW BY HIS LOOKS BY HIS WORDS OR ASSIDUITIES THAT HE LOVED MISS FENTON SHE FLATTERED HERSELF SHE WOULD NEVER THINK OF HIM AGAIN WITH HOPE
AND NOW SPEAK OUT HIS THOUGHTS FREELY AND HEAR MINE IN RETURN WHY THEN HE BEGS A RESPITE FOR A YEAR OR TWO ON WHAT PRETENCE TO ME IT WAS PREFERENCE OF A SINGLE LIFE--BUT I SUSPECT IT IS--WHAT HE IMAGINES TO BE LOVE--AND FOR SOME OBJECT WHOM HE THINKS YOUR LORDSHIP WOULD DISAPPROVE HE HAS NOT THEN ACTUALLY CONFESSED THIS TO YOU IF HE HAS IT WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY SUCH MEANS THAT I AM NOT WARRANTED TO SAY IT IN DIRECT WORDS I HAVE ENTERED INTO NO CONTRACT NO AGREEMENT ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE FRIENDS OF THE LADY I HAVE POINTED OUT SAID LORD ELMWOOD
SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE THE DEVOTION OF EVERY MAN WHO SAW HER AND NOT TO OBTAIN IT OF THE MAN FROM WHOM OF ALL OTHERS SHE MOST WISHED IT WAS CRUELLY HUMILIATING
AND IN A WAY SO ASSURED OF HIS ACQUIESCENCE THAT IF RUSHBROOK'S LIFE HAD DEPENDED UPON HIS DARING TO DISPUTE HIS BENEFACTOR'S WILL HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO HAVE DONE SO
ENRAGED AND OVERWHELMED WITH SORROW AT THE AFFRONT SHE CRIED FORGETTING EVERY OTHER FRIEND SHE HAD OH
AT LAST MISS MILNER RISING WITH ALACRITY WAS PREPARING TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN DORRIFORTH RAISED HIS VOICE AND IN A TONE OF AUTHORITY SAID MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A KIND OF DOUBT OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD--A SURPRISE WHICH FIXED HER HAND ON THE DOOR SHE HAD HALF OPENED BUT WHICH NOW SHE SHEWED HERSELF IRRESOLUTE WHETHER TO OPEN WIDE IN DEFIANCE OR TO SHUT SUBMISSIVELY
AND AS THE EARL HAD WITH THE UTMOST DEGREE OF INFLEXIBILITY RESISTED ALL HIS GOOD COUNSEL UPON THIS SUBJECT HE RESOLVED IN QUITTING HIM NEVER TO BE HIS ADVISER AGAIN
BUT WITH A DETERMINED LOOK EXPRESSIVE OF THE VENGEANCE THAT SHOULD ENSUE
AND YOU SHALL HAVE AT LEAST A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE SAYS SANDFORD THE NEXT MORNING SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ALONE WITH RUSHBROOK--HE THEN PLAINLY REPEATED TO HIM WHAT LORD ELMWOOD HAD SAID AND SAW HIM LISTEN TO IT ALL AND HEARD HIM ANSWER WITH THE MOST TRANQUIL RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD DO ANY THING TO PRESERVE THE FRIENDSHIP AND PATRONAGE OF HIS UNCLE--BUT MARRY WHAT CAN BE YOUR REASON ASKED SANDFORD--THOUGH HE GUESSED
DURING A SLIGHT DELIRIUM OF HER FEVER MISS WOODLEY'S NAME AND HER GUARDIAN'S WERE INCESSANTLY REPEATED
HE FOUND TOO THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO HOPE
THEREFORE SIR MY LORD I DO NOT PRESUME DO NOT SANDFORD AND WE MAY STILL BE GOOD FRIENDS
CERTAINLY I DO REPLIED MISS WOODLEY
ON HEARING HER BEGIN TO SPEAK SANDFORD HAD STOPPED
HER VIEW OF LIFE IS THE INDOOR SENTIMENTAL VIEW OF THE GREAT AUTHOR OF CLARISSA
THIS BEFORE HE OFFERED HIS HAND TO MISS MILNER HE WAS PERFECTLY CONVINCED WOULD NOT BE THE CASE--EVEN MISS FENTON HERSELF ASSURED HIM THAT HER THOUGHTS WERE MORE UPON THE JOYS OF HEAVEN THAN UPON THOSE OF EARTH
AND TO CONVINCE YOU OF IT I WISH THIS MOMENT TO REQUEST A FAVOUR OF YOU I DARE SAY I SHALL REFUSE IT
MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE AT WORK TOGETHER WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
BUT AS I MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO RESIDE CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY--ANSWER ME CANDIDLY DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE HAPPY THERE FOR AT LEAST THREE PARTS OF THE YEAR AFTER A SHORT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I HAVE NO OBJECTION I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT HE RETURNED EAGERLY FOR IT IS MY EARNEST DESIRE TO HAVE YOU WITH ME--YOUR WELFARE IS DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN
THIS BEHAVIOUR OF MR SANDFORD HAD ITS DESIRED EFFECT--IT HUMBLED HER IN HER OWN OPINION MORE THAN A THOUSAND SERMONS WOULD HAVE DONE PREACHED ON THE VANITY OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY
IN THIS MOMENT OF TREMBLING APPREHENSION FOR EVERY THOUGHT WHICH DARTS ACROSS MY MIND AND MORE FOR EVERY ACTION WHICH I MUST SOON BE CALLED TO ANSWER FOR
WHENEVER HE ADDRESSED HER THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL RESERVE UPON HIS COUNTENANCE AND MORE THAN USUAL GENTLENESS IN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS ALSO AS IT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID AN ESTATE BELONGING TO AN UNCLE OF LORD FREDERICK'S AND MOST OF THE PARTY SUSPECTED THEY SHOULD SOON SEE HIM ON A VISIT THERE
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE IS HERE YES RETURNED MISS WOODLEY WITH A GRAVE VOICE AND MANNER TO MODERATE THAT GLOW OF SATISFACTION WHICH FOR A MOMENT SPARKLED EVEN IN HER LANGUID EYE AND BLUSHED OVER HER PALLID COUNTENANCE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEEMING READINESS WITH WHICH MISS MILNER HAD RESIGNED ALL FARTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH LORD FREDERICK DURING THE SHORT RIDE HOME SHE APPEARED TO HAVE LOST GREAT PART OF HER WONTED SPIRITS
HAVE I EVER REFUSED OBEDIENCE TO YOUR COMMANDS WHENEVER YOU THOUGHT PROPER TO LAY THEM UPON ME
ON THIS COUNTENANCE HIS THOUGHTS WERE POURTRAYED
DURING HIS SHORT CONTINUANCE HERE SANDFORD CAUTIOUSLY AVOIDED HIS PRESENCE
WHY DARES NOT SAID MISS WOODLEY
MISS MILNER ANSWERED SHE HAS BEEN MY BENEFACTRESS AND THE BEST I EVER HAD AS SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED AWAY THE TEARS THAT RAN DOWN HER FACE
AND WHEN AT HOME WOULD OFTEN CLOSET HIM FOR HOURS WITH HIS LAWYERS
AND CHARMED AT THE GOOD SENSE AND PROPER SPIRIT WHICH WERE ALWAYS APPARENT IN THE MANNERS OF SANDFORD HE FELL ONCE MORE INTO THE DESPONDENCY OF NEVER BECOMING TO LADY MATILDA ANY THING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO HIS REPUTATION THAN A HUSBAND
TO DESCRIBE HIS BEHAVIOUR EXACTLY IT WAS THE SAME AS HIS LETTER POLITE FRIENDLY COMPOSED AND RESOLVED
INSTEAD OF SHUDDERING AT THE MENACE LORD ELMWOOD HAD UTTERED SHE SAID SHE DARED HIM TO PERFORM IT HE DARES NOT REPEATED SHE
SHE CONFINED HERSELF AT HOME AND YET BY HER OWN ORDER WAS DENIED TO ALL HER VISITORS
LEAVE THE ROOM SAID LORD ELMWOOD TO THE WOMAN I HAVE DONE WITH YOU SHE WITHDREW
WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF DESPAIR WERE PAST MISS MILNER SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE ONCE MORE IN HOPE
GOOD HEAVEN EXCLAIMED MISS WOODLEY
I ONLY TOLD YOU WHAT WAS RIGHT NAY SAID MISS WOODLEY SHE DOES NOT WEEP FOR THAT--SHE FEARS HER FATHER HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S REQUEST
HE PUT HER PEEVISHLY AWAY CRYING NONSENSE NONSENSE--EAT YOUR DINNER BUT HE DID NOT EAT HIMSELF
SANDFORD TO RELIEVE MISS WOODLEY AND HER LOVELY CHARGE FROM THE SUSPENCE IN WHICH HE HAD LEFT THEM PREPARED TO SET OFF FOR THEIR HABITATION IN ORDER HIMSELF TO CONDUCT THEM FROM THENCE TO ELMWOOD CASTLE AND APPOINT SOME RETIRED PART OF IT FOR LADY MATILDA AGAINST THE ANNUAL VISIT HER FATHER SHOULD PAY THERE
HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY HAVING ALREADY SQUANDERED MINE I DON'T THINK ABOUT YOU RETURNED SANDFORD WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE BOOK
I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE AND DO YOU REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE--AT LEAST TILL YOU ARE FORCED AWAY
BUT THEY ARE FRIENDS ONLY IN THE SUNSHINE OF FORTUNE
AND IF HE WAS UPON WHAT BUT THE MOST ROMANTIC AFFECTION ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD HAD MISS MILNER TO DEPEND
DON'T YOU PERCEIVE THAT HE LOVES ME I DO SAID MISS WOODLEY BUT THAT I ALWAYS BELIEVED
COME SAID HE THIS KISS IS A TOKEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AND HE KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY
AND HE REPLIED WITH THE MOST REVERENTIAL BOW I AM BETTER A GREAT DEAL MA'AM THEN INSTANTLY PURSUED HIS WAY AS IF HE DID NOT DARE TO UTTER ANOTHER SYLLABLE
HER HEART WOULD SOMETIMES WHISPER TO HER WHEN SHE WAS HALF ASLEEP LORD FREDERICK IS BANISHED FROM YOU FOR EVER SHE SHAKES OFF THE UNEASINESS THIS IDEA BRINGS ALONG WITH IT--SHE THEN STARTS AND SEES THE BLOW STILL AIMED AT HIM BY DORRIFORTH
THE HEART ONCE GONE OUR THOUGHTS OUR ACTIONS ARE NO MORE OUR OWN THAN THAT IS HE SEEMED FORCING HIMSELF TO UTTER ALL THIS AND YET BROKE OFF AS IF HE COULD HAVE SAID MUCH MORE IF THE EXTREME DELICACY OF THE SUBJECT HAD NOT PREVENTED HIM
BUT SANDFORD WHO NEVER FELT RESENTMENT BUT AGAINST THOSE IN WHOM HE SAW SOME VIRTUE CALMLY REPLIED MY LORD THE DUKE OF AVON WAS A GENTLEMAN A MAN OF ELEGANCE AND BREEDING
IN A WORD I AM MORE AT MY EASE WHEN I AM AWAY FROM HIM--AND I REALLY BELIEVE ADDED HE WITH A SMILE BUT WITH A TEAR AT THE SAME TIME I REALLY BELIEVE I AM MORE AFRAID OF HIM IN MY AGE THAN HE WAS OF ME WHEN HE WAS A BOY MISS WOODLEY WAS PRESENT
AS ONE READS IT ONE CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT IT IS IF NOT DIRECTLY AND CIRCUMSTANTIALLY AT LEAST IN ESSENCE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL
NO SOONER WAS SHE FALLING INTO A SLEEP THAN A THOUSAND VAGUE BUT DISTRESSING IDEAS DARTED ACROSS HER IMAGINATION
AND ASSUMING A BEHAVIOUR NEITHER TOO MUCH ELATED OR DEPRESSED SHE ADVISED THAT THEY SHOULD HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT YET AS USUAL EXPECT AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST.----AFTER TAKING MEASURES FOR QUITTING THEIR MELANCHOLY ABODE WITHIN THE FORTNIGHT THEY ALL DEPARTED FOR ELMWOOD CASTLE--MATILDA MISS WOODLEY AND EVEN SANDFORD FIRST VISITING LADY ELMWOOD'S GRAVE AND BEDEWING IT WITH THEIR TEARS
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD
IF THERE IS ANY THING WANTING FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF YOUR AND LADY MATILDA'S DEPARTURE YOU HAVE BUT TO ORDER IT AND IT IS AT YOUR SERVICE--I MEAN LIKEWISE ANY CASH YOU MAY HAVE OCCASION FOR
HE ONCE THOUGHT TO FOLLOW HIM AND BEG HIS PARDON
NAY MY LORD CRIED MRS HORTON ANY OF THE OTHER SERVANTS COULD TELL YOU JUST AS WELL WHETHER MISS MILNER IS AT HOME OR GONE OUT PERHAPS NOT REPLIED HE
HE COULD HAVE INTERMINGLED HIS--BUT ASSUMING A GRAVE COUNTENANCE HE COMMANDED HER TO DESIST FROM EXHAUSTING HER SPIRITS
IN THE MORTIFICATIONS OF SLIGHT HE WAS EXPERT
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK FOUR WORDS AND BEFORE SHE THOUGHT OF IT HE ABRUPTLY LEFT THE ROOM
LORD ELMWOOD DID NOT DINE AT HOME AT WHICH MISS WOODLEY REJOICED BUT AT WHICH MR SANDFORD APPEARED HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED
BUT SHE SOON HAD OTHER DISTRACTIONS
SUPPOSE I WAS TO WRITE TO HIM AND ENTREAT HIS FORGIVENESS DO NOT WRITE YET SAID SANDFORD WITH NO CHEERING ACCENT
HE ONCE MORE KINDLY BADE HER ADIEU AND THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY
AND SPEAKING OF HER WITH SEVERITY ONE EVENING WHILE SHE WAS AT THE OPERA HIS MEANING AS HE SAID BUT TO CAUTION HER GUARDIAN AGAINST HER FAULTS LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED THERE IS ONE FAULT HOWEVER MR SANDFORD I CANNOT LAY TO HER CHARGE AND WHAT IS THAT MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD EAGERLY WHAT IS THAT ONE FAULT WHICH MISS MILNER HAS NOT I NEVER REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD HEARD MISS MILNER IN YOUR ABSENCE UTTER A SYLLABLE TO YOUR DISADVANTAGE SHE DARES NOT MY LORD BECAUSE SHE IS IN FEAR OF YOU AND SHE KNOWS YOU WOULD NOT SUFFER IT SHE THEN ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP PAYS ME A MUCH HIGHER COMPLIMENT THAN YOU DO
AT DINNER HE SAID HE SHOULD NOT GO TO ELMWOOD HOUSE THE NEXT DAY AS HE HAD APPOINTED BUT STAY WHERE HE WAS THREE OR FOUR DAYS LONGER
AND HE LOOKS VASTLY WELL MATILDA WEPT WITH JOY TO HEAR IT
SANDFORD HIMSELF INTIMIDATED THROUGH AGE OR BY THE AUSTERE AND MOROSE MANNERS WHICH LORD ELMWOOD HAD OF LATE YEARS ADOPTED
YOU AND MY LORD ELMWOOD HAVE MORE NOW THAN YOU HAVE PLACES TO PUT THEM IN VERY TRUE MRS HORTON--I FORGOT THAT--BUT THEN YOU KNOW I CAN GIVE THESE AWAY LORD ELMWOOD WAS IN THE ROOM AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS CONVERSATION----HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SIGHED
I AM SORRY ANY BODY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE IT WAS A TASK IN EXECUTING WHICH I HAD PROMISED MYSELF EXTREME SATISFACTION--BUT FROM THE FEAR THAT YOUR HEALTH WAS NOT YET STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT WITHOUT SOME DANGER THE BURTHEN OF HOPES WHICH I KNEW WOULD UPON THIS OCCASION PRESS UPON YOU I DEFERRED MY COMMUNICATION AND IT HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED
HE STOOD SILENT WITH AMAZEMENT
GUILTY BUT NOT HARDENED IN HER GUILT HER PANGS HER SHAME WERE THE MORE EXCESSIVE
DURING THE HASTY PREPARATIONS FOR THE EARL'S DEPARTURE SANDFORD RECEIVED FROM MISS WOODLEY THE SAD INTELLIGENCE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
BUT STILL WITH A FIRM ASSURANCE I DECLARE THAT PRUDENCE OUTWEIGHS THEM ALL
THE UNAFFECTED CONCERN THE ATTENTION THE GOOD WILL SHE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS LITTLE INCIDENT WAS THAT WHICH MADE IT REMARKABLE AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK FROM LORD ELMWOOD THE DISPLEASURE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN JUST BEFORE PROVOKED OR RATHER TRANSFORMED IT INTO A DEGREE OF ADMIRATION
THAT I WOULD QUIT THE HOUSE THIS MOMENT NEVER TO RETURN SO THAT SHE SUPPLIED THE PLACE I WITH-HOLD FROM HER GO THEN CRIED SANDFORD
CONTRARY TO MY WILL NO MY LORD I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR APPROBATION AND YOU WISHED FOR MY APPROBATION OF THE VERY OPPOSITE THING TO THAT I PROPOSED
SHE GAVE A SCREAM OF TERROR--PUT OUT HER TREMBLING HANDS TO CATCH THE BALUSTRADES FOR SUPPORT--MISSED THEM--AND FELL MOTIONLESS INTO HER FATHER'S ARMS
THEY WOULD THINK THEMSELVES LUCKY IF THEY COULD CLIMB ON TO A PASSING CART TO ARRIVE AT LAST DRENCHED WITH RAIN PERHAPS AT SOME WRETCHED HOSTELRY
YOU TELL A STORY TO BE SURE SAID MRS HORTON TO THE SERVANT
AND SHE FORESAW THAT NOTHING LESS THAN SOME VERY HUMBLE ATONEMENT ON HER PART WOULD PREVAIL UPON THE HAUGHTY PRIEST TO BE RECONCILED
AT THE TIME OF THEIR EVENING WALK HE EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM ACCOMPANYING THEM AND THEY SAW HIM IN A DISTANT FIELD WITH MR SANDFORD IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
FOR TWO REASONS MY LORD;--IN THE FIRST PLACE YOUR VISITS MIGHT BE DISPLEASING TO LORD ELMWOOD
BUT MY POWER OVER HIM MIGHT HAVE BEEN GREATER STILL
AND HER DRESS ENGROSSED ALL HER CONVERSATION AS SOON AS MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE ALONE
BUT I WILL ENQUIRE INTO THE STATE OF MY MIND AND MAKE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH IT VERY SOON AS THE ANGRY DEMEANOUR OF HIS UNCLE AFFECTED RUSHBROOK WITH FEAR SO THAT FEAR POWERFULLY BUT WITH PROPER MANLINESS EXPRESSED AGAIN SOFTENED THE DISPLEASURE OF LORD ELMWOOD
HE LEFT THEM FOR A MOMENT AND GOING TO A SMALL BOOKCASE IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM TOOK OUT OF IT A BOOK AND RETURNING WITH IT IN HIS HAND SAID LORD ELMWOOD DO YOU LOVE THIS WOMAN MORE THAN MY LIFE HE REPLIED WITH THE MOST HEARTFELT ACCENTS
BUT MISS WOODLEY REFLECTED UPON THE INEVITABLE NECESSITY OF THIS MEASURE BEFORE SHE MADE THE PROPOSAL
BECAUSE IT ENTERTAINS ME FOR SHAME FOR SHAME RETURNED HE
AND AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE BOTH WITHOUT THE SMALLEST MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE EXCEPT THROUGH THE JUSTICE OR COMPASSION OF LORD ELMWOOD
BUT HER UNDERSTANDING--HER KNOWLEDGE OF HIS FIRM AND IMMOVEABLE TEMPER
THE CONFIDENCE THAT SHE REPOSED IN THE PROMISES OF LORD ELMWOOD--THE FIRM RELIANCE SHE HAD UPON HIS DELICACY AND HIS JUSTICE--THE UNABATED KINDNESS WITH WHICH HER FRIEND RECEIVED HER WHILE SHE KNEW THAT NO ONE SUSPICIOUS THOUGHT HAD TAKEN HARBOUR IN HER BOSOM--AND THE CONSCIOUS INTEGRITY OF HER OWN INTENTIONS THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISLED BY HER JUDGMENT ALL COMFORTED HER WITH THE HOPE SHE HAD DONE NOTHING SHE OUGHT TO WISH RECALLED
WHY THEN MADAM RETURNED HE IT IS MY OPINION THAT SUPPOSING WHAT YOUR HUMILITY HAS ADVANCED BE JUST YET SIR EDWARD WILL NOT SUFFER BY THE SUGGESTION
THEN MY LORD,"--(CRIED RUSHBROOK IN THE GREATEST AGITATION OF MIND AND BODY YOUR DAUGHTER THE RESOLUTION LORD ELMWOOD HAD TAKEN AND ON WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD TO HIS NEPHEW NOT TO INTERRUPT HIM IMMEDIATELY GAVE WAY
HE LOVED LADY MATILDA TOO SINCERELY HE LOVED HER FATHER'S HAPPINESS AND HER MOTHER'S MEMORY TOO FAITHFULLY NOT TO BE REJOICED AT ALL HE WITNESSED
HE WAS BROUGHT HOME IN A POST CHAISE AND MATILDA HEARD OF THE ACCIDENT WITH MORE GRIEF THAN WOULD PERHAPS ON SUCH AN OCCASION APPERTAIN TO THE MOST FONDLED CHILD
OR SHOWED BY EVERY WORD AND LOOK WHEN SHE WAS PRESENT THAT SHE WAS STILL LESS IN HIS FAVOUR THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN
TO EVERY OTHER PROSPECT IN HER VIEW THY WILL BE DONE IS HER CONTINUAL EXCLAMATION
MRS INCHBALD'S IS PART AND PARCEL OF HER MATTER
AND GAVE HER GUARDIAN AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING SEVERAL OF THE KINDEST AND POLITEST THINGS UPON HER READY COMPLIANCE
BUT PERHAPS I WAS DECEIVED BY THE BEAUTIES OF HER DISPOSITION CHAPTER III
AND CRIED WOULD YOU BE THE MINISTER OF MY FATHER'S CRUELTY THEN SAID SANDFORD SOLEMNLY TO HER FAREWELL--FROM THIS MOMENT YOU AND I PART
DURING THE ILLNESS OF RUSHBROOK NEWS HAD BEEN SENT OF HIS DANGER FROM THE SERVANTS IN TOWN TO THOSE AT ELMWOOD HOUSE AND LADY MATILDA EXPRESSED COMPASSION WHEN SHE WAS TOLD OF IT--SHE BEGAN TO CONCEIVE THE INSTANT SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD SOON DIE THAT HIS VISIT TO HER HAD MERIT RATHER THAN IMPERTINENCE IN ITS DESIGN AND THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A MORE DESERVING MAN THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED HIM TO BE
YET MILDER AT THIS CRISIS IN HIS TEMPER THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS BEFORE AND KNOWING HE COULD BE NO LONGER IRRITATED UPON THE SUBJECT OF HIS DAUGHTER HE ONCE MORE RESOLVED TO TRUST HIMSELF IN A CONFERENCE WITH RUSHBROOK ON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE
SHE THEREFORE STOOD STILL
SANDFORD WISHED IF POSSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER WOULD UNDERTAKE THE DANGEROUS TASK OF RECALLING TO HIS MEMORY THERE EVER WAS SUCH A PERSON AS HIS WIFE
AS SHE APPROACHED SHE MADE AN INCLINATION OF HER HEAD TO MRS HORTON THEN TO HER GUARDIAN AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN SHE FIRST SAW THEM IN A MORNING--HE LOOKED IN HER FACE AS HE BOWED IN RETURN THEN FIXED HIS EYES UPON THE FIRE-PLACE RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AND BEGAN TALKING WITH MR SANDFORD
IN ALLEVIATION OF THEIR BANISHMENT MISS WOODLEY WITH HER CHARGE HAD NOT RETURNED TO THEIR OLD RETREAT
YES SIR
SANDFORD DINED AS USUAL WITH LORD ELMWOOD
RUSHBROOK WHO AT TWENTY MILES DISTANCE COULD HAVE NO CONJECTURE WHAT HAD PASSED AT ELMWOOD HOUSE DURING THE SHORT VISIT LORD ELMWOOD MADE THERE WENT THAT WAY WITH HIS DOGS AND GUN IN ORDER TO MEET HIM ON HIS RETURN AND ACCOMPANY HIM IN THE CHAISE BACK--HE DID SO--AND GETTING INTO THE CARRIAGE TOLD HIM EAGERLY THE SPORT HE HAD HAD DURING THE DAY
HE WAS THE MAN WHOM DORRIFORTH WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BEFORE ANY OTHER FOR THE HUSBAND OF HIS WARD AND HIS WISHES MADE HIM SOMETIMES HOPE AGAINST HIS COOLER JUDGMENT THAT SIR EDWARD WOULD NOT BE REJECTED--HE WAS RESOLVED AT ALL EVENTS TO TRY THE FORCE OF HIS OWN POWER IN THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION OF HIM
BUT SINCE HIS DARING INTRUSION INTO MY APARTMENTS HE HAS BEEN AN OBJECT OF MY HATRED BUT NOW PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING TO PLEASE YOU CRIED MISS WOODLEY
PERFECTLY SECURE IN THE AFFECTIONS OF THE MAN SHE LOVED HER DECLINING HEALTH NO LONGER THREATENED HER
THE NEWS OF THIS INTENDED JOURNEY WAS OF COURSE SOON MADE PUBLIC
IN THE BOSOM OF MISS WOODLEY ALONE WAS THAT SECRET ENTRUSTED WHICH COULD CALL A BLUSH INTO HER FACE AND BEFORE HER SHE DID FEEL CONFUSION--BEFORE THE GENTLE FRIEND TO WHOM SHE HAD TILL THIS TIME COMMUNICATED ALL HER FAULTS WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT SHE NOW CAST DOWN HER EYES IN SHAME
END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
BUT HEAVEN FORBID--THAT WOULD SINK ME EVEN LOWER THAN I AM SCARCE ABLE TO MOVE SHE ROSE AND LOOKED IN HER GLASS AS IF TO ARRANGE HER FEATURES AND IMPOSE UPON HIM
THE ALTERNATE HOPE AND FEAR WHICH FLUTTERED IN HER HEART GAVE A MORE THAN USUAL BRILLIANCY TO HER EYES AND MORE THAN USUAL BLOOM TO HER COMPLECTION
YOU KNOW MADAM SAID YOUNG EVANS THAT HANDSOME GENTLEMAN WHO HANDED YOU INTO YOUR CARRIAGE AND YOU CALLED MY LORD OH
NOTHING NEW RETURNED HE EXCEPT THE INSOLENCE OF A YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHAT NOBLEMAN CRIED RUSHBROOK
THAT I COULD HAVE LAID IT DOWN THIS MORNING UNSULLIED WITH A CAUSE FOR WHICH IT WILL MAKE BUT INADEQUATE ATONEMENT HIS NEXT REPROACH WAS--"I HAVE OFFENDED AND FILLED WITH HORROR A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WHOM IT WAS MY DUTY TO HAVE PROTECTED FROM THOSE BRUTAL MANNERS TO WHICH I MYSELF HAVE EXPOSED HER AGAIN--"I HAVE DRAWN UPON MYSELF THE JUST UPBRAIDINGS OF MY FAITHFUL PRECEPTOR AND FRIEND
AND FROM THAT TIME THOUGH MISS MILNER'S BEHAVIOUR CONTINUED THE SAME YET HER LOOKS AND HER VOICE WERE TOTALLY ALTERED--FOR THE WORLD SHE COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED CHEERFULLY
A SERVANT CAME IN AND TOLD LORD ELMWOOD THE CARRIAGE WAS AT THE DOOR HE REPLIED VERY WELL BUT THOUGH HE HAD BREAKFASTED HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE
THE FIRST MORNING HE WENT A SHOOTING AND RETURNING ABOUT NOON ENQUIRED OF SANDFORD WHO WAS SITTING IN THE ROOM IF HE HAD TAKEN UP A VOLUME OF PLAYS LEFT UPON THE TABLE
BEFORE DINNER WAS OVER HE WAS HOWEVER MORE HIMSELF BUT STILL HE APPEARED THOUGHTFUL AND DISSATISFIED
MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE
STILL SHE COULD NOT BUT REFLECT THE LONGER HE WAS IN COMING TO THIS DETERMINATION THE MORE IRREVOCABLE IT WOULD BE WHEN ONCE TAKEN
SHE REMAINED COOL
IT WAS OF NO AVAIL--A SERENITY OF MIND COULD ALONE EFFECT WHAT SHE DESIRED
YOU ARE UNJUST SIR IN SAYING SO BEFORE THE TRIAL REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD AND YOUR INJUSTICE SHALL MAKE ME MORE CAUTIOUS LEST I FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE BUT MY LORD MY MIND IS MADE UP MR SANDFORD RETURNED HE INTERRUPTING HIM
AMIDST THE COMPLAINTS THE SORROW AND THE AFFRIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FARM MISS WOODLEY'S SENSATIONS WANTED A NAME--TERROR AND ANGUISH GIVE BUT A FAINT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SHE SUFFERED--SOMETHING LIKE THE APPROACH OF DEATH STOLE OVER HER SENSES AND SHE SAT LIKE ONE PETRIFIED WITH HORROR
BUT MISS MILNER KEPT HER SEAT TILL HIS EYE WAS TURNED UPON HER AND HE MOVED SLOWLY TOWARDS HER
SUCH COMMAND HAS BEAUTY IF UNITED WITH SENSE AND VIRTUE
HE LOOKED AT THE SEAL BUT NOT AT THE DIRECTION
AS SOON AS THE NAME OF MISS MILNER WAS UTTERED SHE LIFTED UP HER HANDS AND THE TEARS STARTED IN HER EYES
AND THEN SAID TO THE STRANGER YOU MAY SPEAK BEFORE THESE GENTLEMEN THE MAN INSTANTLY TURNED PALE AND TREMBLED--THEN TO PROLONG THE TIME BEFORE HE SPOKE WENT TO THE DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SHUT--RETURNED--YET STILL TREMBLING SEEMED UNWILLING TO SAY HIS ERRAND
CHANGED TO WHAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY
ALL WAS RESPECT AND DUTY ON THE PART OF THE DOMESTICS--ALL PATERNAL CARE ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD
FOR WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF HER ARRIVAL IN LONDON SHE HAD MARRIED MR INCHBALD
AND SEEING AND PITYING HIS NEPHEW'S SENSIBILITY HE NOW CHANGED HIS AUSTERE VOICE AND SAID MILDLY BUT FIRMLY I GIVE YOU A WEEK TO CONSULT WITH YOURSELF
MISS WOODLEY SLEPT LITTLE BUT MATILDA LESS--SHE AWAKED REPEATEDLY DURING THE NIGHT AND EVERY TIME SIGHED TO HERSELF I SLEEP IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH MY FATHER
WHILE WE REMAIN HERE THEREFORE LADY MATILDA IS SAFE WITH HER FATHER
MISS WOODLEY FELT SO ACUTELY THE TORMENTS OF HER FRIEND THAT HAD NOT HER REASON TOLD HER THAT THE INFLEXIBLE MIND OF LORD ELMWOOD WAS FIXED BEYOND HER POWER TO SHAKE SHE HAD CAST HERSELF AT HIS FEET AND IMPLORED THE RETURN OF HIS AFFECTION AND TENDERNESS AS THE ONLY MEANS TO SAVE HIS ONCE-BELOVED WARD FROM AN UNTIMELY DEATH
FOR GOD'S SAKE TAKE CARE WHAT YOU ARE DOING--YOU ARE DESTROYING MY PROSPECTS OF FUTURITY--YOU ARE MAKING THIS WORLD TOO DEAR TO ME HER DROOPING HEAD WAS THEN LIFTED UP AND SHE CAUGHT THE EYE OF DORRIFORTH
PERSISTING IN HIS HOPES HE ONE MORNING MET MISS WOODLEY IN THE GARDEN AND ENGAGING HER A LONGER TIME THAN USUAL IN CONVERSATION AT LAST OBTAINED HER PROMISE SHE WOULD THAT DAY DINE WITH HIM AND MR SANDFORD BUT NO SOONER HAD SHE PARTED FROM HIM THAN SHE REPENTED OF HER CONSENT
NOT A SIGN NOT A SYMPTOM APPEARED--NAY LORD ELMWOOD HAD SINCE THE EVENING OF LORD FREDERICK'S VISIT WHICH AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED SEEMED TO AFFECT HIM SO EXCEEDINGLY BECOME JUST THE SAME MAN HE WAS BEFORE THE CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED
BUT REDUCED TO THIS NECESSITY PITY THE MOTIVES THAT HAVE URGED IT MISS WOODLEY DID PITY THEM
GIVE ME YOUR ADVICE TO DELIVER ME FROM THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH SURROUND ME MISS WOODLEY WAS STILL PALE AND STILL SILENT
BUT THE ANSWER WAS HE WAS BUSY THUS WHOLLY DEFEATED IN HIS HOPES OF RECONCILIATION HIS NEW TRANSPORTS FELT AN ALLAY AND THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAINED BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD CAME HE PASSED IN SOLITARY MUSING AND INEFFECTUAL WALKS AND LOOKS TOWARDS THAT PATH IN WHICH HE HAD MET MATILDA--SHE CAME THAT WAY NO MORE--INDEED SCARCE QUITTED HER APARTMENT IN THE PRACTICE OF THAT CONFINEMENT SHE WAS TO EXPERIENCE ON THE ARRIVAL OF HER FATHER
IS SHE HANDSOME OR UGLY I REALLY CAN'T TELL IT IS VERY STRANGE YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE NOTICE I DID TAKE NOTICE BUT I CANNOT DEPEND UPON MY OWN JUDGMENT--TO ME SHE APPEARED BEAUTIFUL AS AN ANGEL
THE DAY FOR HER LEAVING BATH WAS FIXED
BUT IN THIS LAST TOKEN OF HIS FRIEND'S ESTEEM HE STILL WAS RESTRAINED FROM ALL AUTHORITY TO DIRECT HIS WARD IN ONE RELIGIOUS OPINION CONTRARY TO THOSE HER MOTHER HAD PROFESSED AND IN WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN EDUCATED
FOR MYSELF THEN ALL CONCERN WILL BE OVER--BUT THERE IS A CARE THAT PURSUES ME TO THE GRAVE AND THREATENS MY WANT OF REPOSE EVEN THERE
THE FIRST PERSON WHOSE OPINION HE WITH ALL PROPER RESERVE ASKED CONCERNING MISS MILNER WAS LADY EVANS THE WIDOW OF A BARONET WHO FREQUENTLY VISITED AT MRS HORTON'S
IT WILL INVOLVE US ALL IN GREATER DISQUIET THAN WE SUFFER AT PRESENT THEN WHAT HAS INFLUENCED YOU MY DEAR MISS MILNER THAT WHICH IMPELS ALL MY ACTIONS--AN UNSURMOUNTABLE INSTINCT--A FATALITY THAT WILL FOR EVER RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF HUMAN BEINGS
AND WHEN HE DIFFIDENTLY INQUIRED OF HER HEALTH A COLD RESTRAINT OVERSPREAD MISS WOODLEY'S FACE AND SHE LEFT HIM INSTANTLY
AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NEVER FROM THAT HOUR INDULGE REPOSE
SHE CAST HER EYES UPON THE GARDENS TOO--UPON THE FISH PONDS--EVEN THE COACH HOUSES AND ALL THE OFFICES ADJOINING--WHICH AS OBJECTS THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE AGAIN--SHE CONTEMPLATED AS OBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE
THOUGH WHEN IT WAS FIRST POINTED OUT TO HER SHE SHRUNK BACK WITH FEAR AND IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE DARED VENTURE TO CAST HER EYES COMPLETELY UPON IT
HE PASSED HIM AS HASTILY AS HE COULD AND ENQUIRING FOR LORD ELMWOOD DISCLOSED TO HIM HIS ERRAND
EXASPERATED AT SO UNEXPECTED A RECEPTION AND AT THE PAIN OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT RUSHBROOK REPLIED HE TREATED HIM CRUELLY NOR WOULD HE STIR OUT OF HIS ROOM TILL HE HAD RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION THEN BRING YOUR BED REPLIED SANDFORD FOR YOU MUST PASS YOUR WHOLE NIGHT HERE HE FOUND IT VAIN TO THINK OF OBTAINING ANY INTELLIGENCE BY THREATS HE THEREFORE SAID IN A TIMID AND PERSUASIVE MANNER DID YOU MR SANDFORD HEAR LADY MATILDA MENTION MY NAME YES REPLIED SANDFORD A LITTLE BETTER RECONCILED TO HIM
ABOUT THIS TIME LORD MARGRAVE DEPRIVED BY THE SEASON OF ALL THE SPORTS OF THE FIELD FELT HIS LOVE FOR MATILDA WHICH HAD BEEN VIOLENT EVEN THOUGH DIVIDED WITH THE LOVE OF HUNTING NOW TOO STRONG TO BE SUBDUED
I AM ASHAMED TO TELL HIM THE CAUSE OF MY UNEASINESS
HE SAW HER SILENT AND COVERED WITH CONFUSION
YOU CAN'T READ A WORD OF THESE BOOKS CAN'T I MR SANDFORD
MRS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT--MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE--STIRRED THE FIRE--AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
HIS ENDEAVOURS WERE SUCCESSFUL--SHE WAS SOOTHED EVERY TIME HE SPOKE TO HER
HE HURRIED TO TELL THE FALSEHOOD HE THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO TELL THAT THE PAIN AND SHAME MIGHT BE OVER
IN THIS PERPLEXED SITUATION THE COUNTRY AIR WAS RATHER OF DETRIMENT THAN SERVICE TO THE INVALID
IN THE MEAN TIME RUSHBROOK HAPPIER THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR MONTHS INTOXICATED WITH JOY AT THAT VOLUNTARY MARK OF CIVILITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MATILDA FELT HIS HEART SO JOYOUS AND SO FREE FROM EVERY PARTICLE OF MALICE THAT HE RESOLVED IN THE HUMBLEST MANNER TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THE VIOLATION OF DECORUM HE HAD LATELY COMMITTED AGAINST MR SANDFORD
IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHE PAID A VISIT TO HER MARRIED SISTERS IN LONDON WHERE SHE MET ANOTHER ACTOR MR INCHBALD WHO SEEMS IMMEDIATELY TO HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AND TO HAVE PROPOSED
MATILDA WAS EXILED
WHILE SHE WAS STILL IN HER SOLITARY LODGING A THEATRICAL MANAGER NAMED DODD ATTEMPTED TO USE HIS POSITION AS A COVER FOR SEDUCTION
WHERE IS YOUR MISTRESS SAID LORD ELMWOOD
SHE WAS FOND OF WALKING AND RIDING--WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ARTS OF MUSIC AND DRAWING BY THE MOST CAREFUL INSTRUCTIONS OF HER MOTHER--AND AS A SCHOLAR SHE EXCELLED MOST OF HER SEX FROM THE PAINS WHICH SANDFORD HAD TAKEN WITH THAT PART OF HER EDUCATION AND THE SUPERIOR ABILITIES HE POSSESSED FOR THE TASK
THE FAMILY CONSISTED OF FEW PERSONS ALL OF WHOM RAN INSTANTLY TO THE DOORS AND OPENED THEM
IS MY LORD IN A GOOD TEMPER ASKED MISS WOODLEY
AND HIS EXTREME BEAUTY AND ENGAGING MANNERS WANTED NOT THE SORROWS TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN TO GIVE HIM FARTHER RECOMMENDATION TO THE KINDNESS OF HER WHO HAD COME TO VISIT HIM
AND TO HER COMFORT HER FRIEND WAS MUCH LESS SEVERE ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THAN SHE EXPECTED
THE ONE WOULD RATHER LIVE HEREAFTER THOUGH IN ALL THE TORTURES DESCRIBED AS CONSTITUTING HIS FUTURE STATE THAN CEASE TO EXIST
MISS MILNER HAD CONSIDERED THAT THE PERIOD FOR HER TO COUNTERFEIT APPEARANCES WAS DIMINISHED NOW TO A MOST CONTRACTED ONE
BUT HOW UNIMPORTANT HOW WEAK HOW INEFFECTUAL ARE WORDS IN CONVERSATION--LOOKS AND MANNERS ALONE EXPRESS--FOR MISS WOODLEY WITH HER CHARITABLE FACE AND MILD ACCENTS SAYING SHE WOULD NOT FORGIVE IMPLIED ONLY FORGIVENESS--WHILE MRS HORTON WITH HER ENRAGED VOICE AND ASPECT BEGGING HEAVEN TO PARDON THE OFFENDER PALPABLY SAID SHE THOUGHT HER UNWORTHY OF ALL PARDON
MRS HORTON WAS SHOCKED AT THE IRREVERENT MANNER IN WHICH MR SANDFORD WAS TREATED--AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED TO HIM WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE UPON HER FACE HOPING TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE REPROACH
UPON ENTERING THE DINING-ROOM AND SEEING LORD ELMWOOD'S PLACE AT TABLE VACANT SHE STARTED BACK
AND SHE TREMBLED--EITHER WITH SHAME OR WITH RESENTMENT
SHE LANGUISHED AND WAS ONCE IN IMMINENT DANGER
WHEN THE REPORT OF A PISTOL AND A CONFUSED NOISE OF PERSONS ASSEMBLING TOWARDS THE APARTMENT PREVENTED HIM
WHEN TEA WAS BROUGHT MISS WOODLEY ASKED THE SERVANT WHO ATTENDED IF HE HAD SEEN HIS LORD
AND BEARING ON HIS MIND A STILL MORE PAINFUL RECOLLECTION THE BURTHEN OF HIS KIND PATRON'S CONTINUAL DISPLEASURE
AND SO I SHALL FOR EVER BUT YOU MISTAKE MR RUSHBROOK
IN PASSING THROUGH THE HOUSE ON HIS RETURN HOME SANDFORD MET BY ACCIDENT MRS HORTON MISS MILNER AND THE OTHER TWO LADIES RETURNING FROM A SAUNTER IN THE GARDEN
AND NOW MY DEAR MISS MILNER LET NOT AFFECTED RESENTMENT CONTEMPT OR LEVITY OPPOSE THAT SERENITY WHICH FOR THE WEEK TO COME I WISH TO ENJOY
BUT HE MADE NO REPLY
AND IF BY ADVISING HER WE CAN SAVE HER FROM SHE WAS GOING ON YOU MAY CALL IT WICKED MADAM NOT TO INFORM HER OF WHAT I HAVE HINTED AT CRIED HE
NAY THAT IS UNKIND CRIED MISS WOODLEY
THERE IS A SECRET CHARM IN BEING PITIED WHEN THE MISFORTUNE IS BUT IDEAL
I WILL NO LONGER THREATEN TO DISCLOSE A SECRET YOU HAVE TRUSTED ME WITH BUT LEAVE IT TO THE WISDOM OR SENSIBILITY OF HIS HEART WHO IS NOW TO PENETRATE INTO THE HEARTS OF OUR SEX IN SEARCH OF ONE THAT MAY BEAT IN UNISON WITH HIS OWN TO FIND IT OUT
BUT COME MR SANDFORD I WILL DARE DO AS MUCH AS YOU
FOR HE HAD TREATED THE YOUNG MAN TOO UNKINDLY NOT TO DREAD LEST ANY ILL SHOULD BEFALL HIM
AS IF HE THANKED HIM FOR THE JOURNEY WHICH IT WAS LIKELY HE SUSPECTED HE HAD BEEN TAKING
THESE MUTUAL SENTIMENTS WERE DISCOVERABLE IN EVERY WORD AND ACTION WHILE THEY WERE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
HERE IN 1779 SUDDENLY AND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUSLY MR INCHBALD DIED
THEN MISS MILNER SAID DORRIFORTH YOU SEE LORD FREDERICK NO MORE--AND I HOPE I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO APPRIZE HIM OF THIS ARRANGEMENT YOU HAVE SIR SHE REPLIED WITH A COMPLETELY UNEMBARRASSED COUNTENANCE AND VOICE
DO YOU THINK HE RECEIVED A DISPENSATION FROM HIS VOWS TO BECOME THE HUSBAND OF A COQUETTE--A----."--HE WAS GOING ON
BUT ON THIS MISS WOODLEY INTERFERED AND HAVING TAKEN HER HEAD UPON HER ARM ASSURED HIM IT WAS A WEAKNESS TO WHICH MISS MILNER WAS ACCUSTOMED
THEIR JUDGMENT IS SWAYED BY A HUNDRED SIDE-CONSIDERATIONS WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ART BUT HAPPEN EASILY TO IMPRESS THE IMAGINATION OR TO FIT IN WITH THE FASHION OF THE HOUR
SHE THEN SAID WITH SOME RESERVE TELL ME THE PURPORT OF YOUR COMING SIR AND PERHAPS I MAY HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN IT WAS TO SEE LADY MATILDA HE REPLIED OR TO HEAR OF HER HEALTH
NAY DO NOT MISTAKE ME SAID SANDFORD
OUR CONCERN OUR DEVOTION IS PAID TO THE SAME OBJECTS AND ONE COMMON INTEREST SHOULD TEACH US TO BE FRIENDLY SHE MADE NO REPLY.--"WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO WRITE TO YOU WHEN I AM AWAY SAID HE
THIS PUT AN END TO HER DIFFICULTIES BUT IN SPITE OF HER EFFORTS TO AVOID NOTICE HER BEAUTY HAD ALREADY ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND SHE HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A STRANGER WITH WHOM SHE IMMEDIATELY ENTERED INTO CORRESPONDENCE
NEVER FOR HER MOTHER'S SAKE SUFFER MY HEART AGAIN TO BE SOFTENED BY AN OBJECT I MIGHT DOTE UPON
MY WILL IS FIXED THE REQUEST MY LORD REPLIED SANDFORD AND HE TOOK OUT A POCKET-BOOK FROM WHENCE HE DREW SEVERAL PAPERS IS CONTAINED IN THIS LETTER
YOU WOULD KEEP ME IN UTTER IGNORANCE I WOULD FROM A SELF-INTERESTED MOTIVE MR SANDFORD--THAT I MIGHT HAVE A GREATER RESPECT FOR YOU SOME OF THE COMPANY LAUGHED--MRS HORTON COUGHED--MISS WOODLEY BLUSHED--LORD ELMWOOD SNEERED--DORRIFORTH FROWNED--AND MISS FENTON LOOKED JUST AS SHE DID BEFORE
THE DECEPTION PASSED--HIS UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND AT LENGTH HIGHLY PLEASED WITH HIS ENGAGING MANNER AND APPLICABLE REPLIES TOOK HIM ON HIS KNEE AND KISSED HIM WITH AFFECTION
AND HER NIECE WAS TO ACCOMPANY HER
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SEEMING INDIFFERENCE WHILE HIS INDISPOSITION CONTINUED NO SOONER WAS HE RECOVERED SO AS TO RECEIVE THE CONGRATULATIONS OF HIS FRIENDS THAN THERE WAS NO ONE PERSON HE EVIDENTLY SHOWED SO MUCH SATISFACTION AT SEEING AS MISS WOODLEY
ON WHICH TWO MEN RUSHED IN AND WITH THE PLEA OF SAVING LADY MATILDA FROM THE PRETENDED FLAMES CAUGHT HER IN THEIR ARMS AND CARRIED HER OFF
A START OF ASTONISHMENT WHICH HE GAVE ON BEHOLDING HER
LOOK AT MY HORRID HABITATION TOO,--AND ASK YOURSELF--WHETHER I AM AN OBJECT OF RESENTMENT WHILE LORD ELMWOOD READ THIS LETTER IT TREMBLED IN HIS HAND
MISS MILNER WAS ENOUGH RECOVERED TO BE PRESENT AT DINNER THOUGH SHE SCARCE TASTED A MORSEL
BUT ALTHOUGH SHE RECEIVED OVERTURES FROM MANY MEN OF THE FIRST RANK SHE PREFERRED HER GUARDIAN THE PRESENT LORD ELMWOOD THEN MR DORRIFORTH TO THEM ALL--AND IT IS SAID THEIR MARRIAGE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN UNCOMMON SHARE OF FELICITY TILL HIS LORDSHIP GOING ABROAD AND REMAINING THERE SOME TIME THE CONSEQUENCES TO A MOST CAPTIVATING YOUNG WOMAN LEFT WITHOUT A PROTECTOR WERE SUCH AS TO CAUSE A SEPARATION ON HIS RETURN
THEY WERE EQUIVOCAL--FROM SIR CHARLES BUNBURY
AND I REJOICE THEY ARE SUCH AS I CAN GRANT WITH EASE AND HONOUR TO MYSELF
BUT STILL IN HIS ABSENCE MISS MILNER'S GOOD NATURE AND TOTAL FREEDOM FROM MALICE NEVER SUFFERED HER TO UTTER A SENTENCE INJURIOUS TO HIS INTEREST
AND IF IT WERE EVEN HIS WILL THAT HER CHILD SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY AS WELL AS BANISHMENT IT SHOULD BE SO
SANDFORD LOOKED AT HER INQUISITIVELY SIPPED HIS TEA AND SAID HE NEVER MADE TEA TO HIS OWN LIKING MISS MILNER TOOK A CUP BUT HAD SCARCE STRENGTH TO HOLD IT
IN THIS POSTURE OF AFFAIRS THE LETTER OF INVITATION ARRIVES FROM LADY LUNEHAM AT BATH
THEIR APPREHENSIONS WERE FAR MORE FORCIBLE THAN THEIR CURIOSITY
YOU REMEMBER SAID MISS WOODLEY HE TOLD YOU HE SHOULD DINE FROM HOME THIS DID NOT HOWEVER DISMISS HER FEARS AND SHE DISPATCHED TWO SERVANTS DIFFERENT WAYS IN PURSUIT OF HIM ACQUAINTING THEM WITH HER SUSPICIONS AND CHARGING THEM TO PREVENT THE DUEL
AND IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR SUFFERINGS THIS SHALL BE THE EXPEDIENT UNLESS YOU INSTANTLY AGREE TO SOME OTHER GOOD HEAVEN MISS WOODLEY
I LET HIM KNOW I DECLINED WHERE IS SANDFORD ASKED LORD ELMWOOD
YOU KNOW OF NO OTHER MEANS MISS WOODLEY HE CRIED
AND WHEN I RECOVER MY LORD YOU GIVE ME LEAVE TO REVEAL TO YOU MY WISHES LET THEM BE WHAT THEY WILL HIS UNCLE HESITATED----BUT SEEING AN ANXIETY FOR THE ANSWER BY HIS RAISING HIMSELF UPON HIS ELBOW IN THE BED AND STARING WILDLY LORD ELMWOOD AT LAST SAID CERTAINLY--YES YES AS A CHILD IS ANSWERED FOR ITS QUIET
YOU THEN THINK SERIOUSLY OF LORD FREDERICK SUPPOSE I DO WHEREFORE THAT ALAS MISS WOODLEY BECAUSE I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH HIM THAT IS PLAINLY TELLING ME HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH ME I DO NOT KNOW--I CANNOT SPEAK OF MARRIAGE FROM EXPERIENCE ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY BUT I THINK I CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS NOR CAN I SPEAK OF LOVE FROM EXPERIENCE REPLIED MISS MILNER BUT I THINK I CAN GUESS WHAT IT IS BUT DO NOT FALL IN LOVE MY DEAR CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH HER ACCUSTOMED SIMPLICITY OF HEART AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ASKING A FAVOUR THAT DEPENDED UPON THE WILL OF THE PERSON ENTREATED PRAY DO NOT FALL IN LOVE WITHOUT THE APPROBATION OF YOUR GUARDIAN HER YOUNG FRIEND SMILED AT THE INEFFICACIOUS PRAYER BUT PROMISED TO DO ALL SHE COULD TO OBLIGE HER
I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE
AND YET AMIDST OUR DEAREST FRIENDS AND AMONG PERSONS WHO HAVE THE SAME DISPOSITIONS AND SENTIMENTS AS OUR OWN THEIR MINDS TOO FIXED UPON THE SELF-SAME OBJECTS IS THIS CONSTRAINT PRACTISED--AND THUS SOCIETY WHICH WAS MEANT FOR ONE OF OUR GREATEST BLESSINGS BECOMES INSIPID NAY OFTEN MORE WEARISOME THAN SOLITUDE I THINK YOUNG MAN REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE MADE PRETTY FREE WITH YOUR SPEECH TO-DAY AND OUGHT NOT TO COMPLAIN OF THE WANT OF TOLERATION ON THAT SCORE I DO COMPLAIN REPLIED RUSHBROOK FOR IF TOLERATION WAS MORE FREQUENT THE FAVOUR OF OBTAINING IT WOULD BE LESS AND YOUR PRIDE I SUPPOSE IS ABOVE RECEIVING A FAVOUR NEVER FROM THOSE I ESTEEM
BUT BEFORE ANY ACCOMMODATION COULD TAKE PLACE THE PEACE AND COMPOSURE OF THEIR ABODE WERE DISTURBED BY THE ARRIVAL OF SIR EDWARD ASHTON AT LORD ELMWOOD'S WHERE IT APPEARED AS IF HE HAD BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO PURSUE HIS MATRIMONIAL PLAN
WE KNOW IT
AND THOUGH MISS WOODLEY HAD BEHELD THEM TOO MISS MILNER'S FANCY HEIGHTENED THE EXPRESSION OF EVERY GLANCE TILL HER CONSTRUCTION BECAME BY DEGREES SO EXTREMELY FAVOURABLE TO HER OWN WISHES THAT HAD NOT HER FRIEND BEEN PRESENT AND KNOWN IN WHAT MEASURE TO ESTIMATE THOSE SYMPTOMS SHE MUST INFALLIBLY HAVE THOUGHT BY THE JOY TO WHICH THEY GAVE BIRTH THAT HE HAD OPENLY AVOWED A PASSION FOR HER
I THOUGHT SAID SHE I THOUGHT LORD ELMWOOD HAD BEEN DEAD--ARE MY SENSES DISORDERED STILL NO MY DEAR ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY IT IS THE PRESENT LORD ELMWOOD WHO WISHES TO SEE YOU
AND IF YOU CAN RISE SO EARLY--WHY DO MISS MILNER SAID MISS WOODLEY FOR SHE CAUGHT EAGERLY AT THE HOPE OF HER PASSING THIS NIGHT IN LESS UNHAPPINESS THAN SHE HAD FOREBODED PRAY RISE AT THAT HOUR TO BREAKFAST
IN 1796 SHE PUBLISHED NATURE AND ART AND TEN YEARS LATER APPEARED HER LAST WORK--A SERIES OF BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICES PREFIXED TO A LARGE COLLECTION OF ACTING PLAYS
YOU MAY SPARE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF QUOTING THEM HER PRIDE WAS HURT AT THIS BEYOND BEARING
THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT YET DEFINE SAID RUSHBROOK THAT LORD ELMWOOD STRUGGLES WITH
AND THOSE WHO HEARD THEM THOUGHT LITTLE OF THEIR MEANING MORE THAN THAT THEY EXPRESSED HER FEAR OF DYING
FOR HE DID NOT EVEN DARE TO SAY BY WHAT MEANS HE HAD BEHELD HER
BUT I AM NOT TO BE CONTROLLED AS FORMERLY
SHE KNEW IT WAS NOT
YET UNDER THE CARE OF A YOUNG NOBLEMAN IMMERSED IN ALL THE VICES OF THE TOWN WITHOUT ONE MORAL EXCELLENCE BUT SUCH AS MIGHT RESULT EVENTUALLY FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOMENT--UNDER SUCH CARE HE TREMBLED FOR HER HAPPINESS--YET TREMBLED MORE LEST HER HEART SHOULD BE PURLOINED WITHOUT EVEN THE AUTHORITY OF MATRIMONIAL VIEWS
ONE FINDS ONESELF SPECULATING OVER THE AUTHOR WONDERING WHAT WAS HER HISTORY AND HOW MUCH OF IT WAS MISS MILNER'S
I OWN SAID DORRIFORTH STRUCK WITH AMAZE AND NOW TAKING HER FROM HIS FEET WITH A FORCE THAT SHE COULD NOT RESIST I OWN MISS MILNER I AM GREATLY AFFECTED AND WOUNDED AT THIS CONTRADICTION IN YOUR CHARACTER BUT DID NOT I SAY SO CRIED SANDFORD INTERRUPTING HIM
UPON SOME OCCASION THE NEXT DAY'S HUNT WAS DEFERRED
ONCE SHE THOUGHT ON RUSHBROOK AND THOUGHT EVEN HE WOULD BE SORRY FOR HER
PRAY HE WAS EARNESTLY INTENT UPON ASKING A QUESTION BUT WAS PREVENTED BY THE PERSON INTERROGATED
THERE WAS HOWEVER A PALENESS IN HER FACE A DEADNESS IN HER EYE AND A KIND OF PALSY OVER HER FRAME WHICH MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD SEEN HER IN EVERY STAGE OF HER UNEASINESS NEVER HAD SEEN BEFORE
ONE MY LORD I NEED NOT NAME--THE OTHER IS MISS WOODLEY THERE WAS A DELICACY AND HUMILITY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH SANDFORD DELIVERED THIS REPLY THAT LORD ELMWOOD COULD NOT RESENT AND HE ONLY RETURNED MISS WOODLEY--IS SHE YET LIVING SHE IS--I LEFT HER AT THE HOUSE I CAME FROM WELL THEN ANSWERED HE YOU MUST SEE THAT MY STEWARD PROVIDES FOR THOSE TWO PERSONS
BUT IF SHE OBSERVED HIM TREAT HER WITH INATTENTION OR INDIFFERENCE SHE WOULD CHERISH FROM THAT MOMENT THE FONDEST EXPECTATIONS
DO YOU ASSUME THE AUTHORITY OF MY LORD ELMWOOD I DO ON THIS OCCASION
AMIDST ALL THE PERSONS AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE IN LORD ELMWOOD'S MARRIAGE-DESIGNS MISS FENTON WAS PERHAPS AFFECTED THE LEAST--SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO HAVE MARRIED SHE WAS CONTENT TO LIVE SINGLE
SIR EDWARD ASHTON THOUGH NOT INVITED BY MISS MILNER YET FREQUENTLY DID HIMSELF THE HONOUR TO VISIT HER AT HER HOUSE
YET EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS DANGER WHILE FOR DAYS HE LAY IN THE CONTINUAL EXPECTATION OF HIS OWN DEATH NOT ALL THE ENTREATIES OF HIS DEAREST MOST INTIMATE AND MOST RESPECTED FRIENDS COULD PREVAIL UPON HIM TO PRONOUNCE FORGIVENESS OF HIS WIFE OR TO SUFFER THEM TO BRING HIS DAUGHTER TO HIM FOR HIS LAST BLESSING
HE CONTINUED YOUR HEALTH APPEARS PERFECTLY RESTORED AND YET I HAVE OBSERVED YOU TAKE NO DELIGHT IN YOUR FORMER AMUSEMENTS ARE YOU SORRY FOR THAT MY LORD NO I AM EXTREMELY GLAD
FOR HE KNEW HIM WITH WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL TOO WELL NOT TO KNOW THAT HE MIGHT BE PROVOKED INTO YET GREATER ANGER
AND MY DEAR CONTINUED HE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HER ACT BUT UNDER THE DOMINION OF THOSE VOWS TO A HUSBAND OF SENSE AND VIRTUE LIKE HIM AND YOU WILL BE ALL THAT I HIMSELF OR EVEN HEAVEN CAN DESIRE
THAN LIKE ONE WHO HAS LIVED HIS WHOLE TIME SECLUDED IN A MONASTERY OR IN HIS OWN STUDY
OF COURSE NOTHING SIMILAR TO LOVE COULD HAVE BEEN DECLARED AT SO EARLY A PERIOD
MISS WOODLEY SEEING THE DISTRESS OF HER MIND MUCH AS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT ENTREATED NAY IMPLORED OF HER TO PERMIT HER TO BE A MEDIATOR
HAVE I ONE RELATION IN THE WORLD BUT HIM
YET MATILDA'S PERSON SHAPE AND COMPLEXION WERE SO EXTREMELY LIKE WHAT HER MOTHER'S ONCE WERE THAT AT THE FIRST GLANCE SHE APPEARED TO HAVE A STILL GREATER RESEMBLANCE OF HER THAN OF HER FATHER--BUT HER MIND AND MANNERS WERE ALL LORD ELMWOOD'S
PERHAPS NOT TILL THREE IN THE MORNING ANSWERED MRS HORTON
NAY GOVERNED THEM SO ENTIRELY THAT NO ONE COULD PERCEIVE NOR DID THE YOUNG LORD HIMSELF KNOW THAT HE HAD ANY
A DUEL WITH HIS OLD ANTAGONIST WAS THE RESULT OF THIS DETERMINATION
BUT I DO YOU CONDESCEND MR SANDFORD CRIED MRS HORTON IN TALKING SO MUCH TO A YOUNG HEEDLESS WOMAN
AND IN THE LIBRARY SHE TOOK UP WITH FILIAL DELIGHT THE PEN WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN WRITING
PROMISED TO CORRESPOND WITH HER PUNCTUALLY AND TO OMIT NO OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING HER EVERY CONSOLATION SHORT OF CHERISHING HER FATAL PASSION--BUT IN THAT AND THAT ONLY WAS THE HEART OF MISS MILNER TO BE CONSOLED
BUT IF SHE HAS ANY IT RESTS THERE AND NO ONE IS THE BETTER FOR IT PSHAW SAID MISS WOODLEY IT IS TIME FOR US TO RETIRE
IMPLORED HER FORGIVENESS
AND AT LAST AFTER TEN DAYS OF TREPIDATION SHE WAS REDUCED TO APPLY FOR HELP TO HER MARRIED SISTERS
SHE HASTENED HER STEPS AND DID SO--THEN TURNING TO MISS WOODLEY SHE SAID I EXPECTED YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO MR RUSHBROOK
THE MOMENT SHE AWOKE ON MONDAY MORNING THE RECOLLECTION THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS THE LAST DAY SHE WAS EVER AGAIN TO SEE HIM SOFTENED ALL THE RESENTMENT HIS YESTERDAY'S CONDUCT HAD RAISED
I NEVER TILL NOW KNEW WHAT THOSE PERSONS FELT WHO EXPERIENCED JOY NOR DID SHE REPINE LIKE MR SANDFORD AND MISS WOODLEY AT HER FATHER'S INATTENTION TO HER DURING HIS MALADY FOR SHE DID NOT HOPE LIKE THEM--SHE DID NOT HOPE HE WOULD BEHOLD HER EVEN IN DYING
AND FOR THE SAKE OF THIS BELOVED OBJECT HE HAD CONTRARY TO HIS RESOLUTION TAKEN UNDER HIS IMMEDIATE CARE YOUNG RUSHBROOK
RUSHBROOK WALKED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND DID NOT SPEAK FOR SOME TIME--THEN TURNING HIMSELF TO MAKE A REPLY BOTH MATILDA AND MISS WOODLEY WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT HE HAD BEEN SHEDDING TEARS HIMSELF.--HAVING CONQUERED THEM HE SAID I WILL NOT OFFEND YOU MADAM BY REMAINING ONE MOMENT LONGER
LORD FREDERICK LEAVES HIS COMPLIMENTS AND GOES AWAY
AS HE SAT FORMING PLANS HOW TO RETRIEVE THE OPINION ILL AS IT WAS WHICH SANDFORD FORMERLY ENTERTAINED OF HIM HE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM LORD ELMWOOD KINDLY ENQUIRING AFTER HIS HEALTH AND SAYING THAT HE SHOULD BE DOWN EARLY IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK
ADULTERY REASON WOULD PERHAPS HAVE INFORMED HER WAS A MORE PERNICIOUS EVIL TO SOCIETY
HER DEVOTIONS INCREASED WITH HER RETIREMENT
AND NOW BY NO MEANS PLEASED WITH THE COMPANION WITH WHOM SHE WAS LEFT SHE ROSE AND WAS GOING LIKEWISE WHEN RUSHBROOK FIXED HIS SPEAKING EYES UPON HER AND CRIED MISS WOODLEY WILL YOU PARDON ME WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY CERTAINLY SIR
MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY SEEING HIS CONSTERNATION AND TREMBLING LEST HE SHOULD GUESS THE SECRET MY LORD MISS MILNER HAS AGAIN DECEIVED YOU--YOU MUST NOT TAKE HER FROM LONDON--IT IS THAT AND THAT ALONE WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF HER UNEASINESS HE SEEMED MORE AMAZED STILL--AND STILL MORE SHOCKED AT HER DUPLICITY THAN AT HER TORTURE
THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF--AND AS IT WENT MATILDA LEANED HER HEAD FROM THE WINDOW TO SURVEY ELMWOOD HOUSE FROM THE ROOF TO THE BOTTOM
BUT GAVE WAY WHEN ALONE TO A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF MELANCHOLY THAN USUAL
HOW VAIN EVERY PRECAUTION THAT WAS TAKEN FOR HER WELFARE
BUT HE RECOLLECTED LADY MATILDA'S MISFORTUNES WERE TOO SACRED TO BE TALKED OF THUS FAMILIARLY BY THE SERVANTS OF THE FAMILY;--BESIDES IT WAS EVIDENT THIS MAN THOUGHT AND BUT NATURALLY IT MIGHT NOT BE FOR HIS MASTER'S INTEREST THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER SHOULD BE UNITED
ALL FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PUT AN END TO FOR THE PRESENT
A PERFORMER OF A VERY MEAN SALARY PLAYED THE APOTHECARY IN ROMEO AND JULIET SO EXACTLY TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE AUDIENCE THAT THIS LITTLE PART INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS DREW IMMENSE HOUSES WHENEVER THE PLAY WAS PERFORMED
AND WHAT HORSES SERVANTS AND CARRIAGES HE TOOK WITH HIM WAS MINUTELY ASKED AND SO ACCURATELY ANSWERED EITHER BY HIMSELF OR BY MR SANDFORD THAT MISS MILNER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD KNOWN HER DOOM BEFORE TILL NOW HAD RECEIVED NO CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF IT--AND AS CIRCUMSTANCES INCREASE OR DIMINISH ALL WE FEEL THE HEARING THESE THINGS TOLD INCREASED THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR TRUTH
LADY LUNEHAM SENT THEM IMMEDIATE WORD OF THIS AND THEY BOTH HASTENED TO BATH AND ARRIVED THERE JUST AS THE VIOLENCE AND DANGER OF HER DISORDER HAD CEASED
AND SHALL CONTINUE INFLEXIBLE I UNDERSTAND YOU MY LORD REPLIED MR GIFFARD YOUR EXPRESS ORDERS TO ME AS WELL AS TO EVERY OTHER PERSON REMAIN JUST THE SAME AS FORMERLY NEVER TO MENTION THIS SUBJECT TO YOU AGAIN THEY DO SIR MY LORD I ALWAYS OBEYED YOU AND HOPE I ALWAYS SHALL I HOPE SO TOO HE REPLIED IN A THREATENING ACCENT--"WRITE TO SANDFORD CONTINUED HE TO LET HIM KNOW MY PLEASURE AND THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO THE STEWARD BOWED AND WITHDREW
AS THESE PASSIONS ALTERNATELY GOVERNED HER SHE WAS ALTERNATELY IN SPIRITS OR DEJECTED
ON WEDNESDAY LAST DIED AT DRING PARK A VILLAGE IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE RIGHT HONOURABLE COUNTESS ELMWOOD.--THIS LADY WHO HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF FOR MANY YEARS IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD WAS A RICH HEIRESS AND OF EXTREME BEAUTY
THE RECORD OF THESE JOURNEYS THROWS AN INTERESTING LIGHT UPON THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROVINCIAL COMPANIES OF THOSE DAYS
BUT WITH HER GLADNESS TO SEE HER GUARDIAN SAFE SHE HAD FORGOT TO ENQUIRE OF THE SAFETY OF HIS ANTAGONIST
SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT THINKING TO RETURN
AND AS WINTER WAS NOW FAR ADVANCED MISS WOODLEY RETURNED TO HER AUNT'S HOUSE IN TOWN FROM WHENCE MRS HORTON WAS HOWEVER PREPARING TO REMOVE IN ORDER TO SUPERINTEND LORD ELMWOOD'S HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE LATE EARL IN GROSVENOR SQUARE
MISS MILNER WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE READ THE WORDS HE IS DEAD AND INSTANTLY THOUGHT HOW TRANSIENT ARE ALL SUBLUNARY THINGS
FOR THAT SHE ALSO LOVED HIM
AND AS LORD ELMWOOD'S WILL WAS A LAW ALL AROUND SUCH WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WILL KNOWN OR MERELY SUPPOSED
AT LENGTH HE DISMISSED HIS VALET AND SITTING DOWN TOOK THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET
AND IF MISS MILNER WAS TO ASK THE QUESTION IN WHAT WORDS COULD SHE TELL OR IN WHAT MANNER DENY THE TRUTH
BUT THAT SHE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WELL RECOLLECTED--WHEN THE CAUSE CAME TO HER MEMORY SHE WOULD HAVE SLEPT AGAIN--BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
MISS WOODLEY TOO WITH ALL HER BOUNDLESS CHARITY AND GOOD WILL WAS UPON THIS OCCASION INDUCED TO LIMIT THEIR EXCESS
I'LL STAY HERE TILL HE RETURNS--AGAIN THROW MYSELF IN HIS WAY AND THEN I WILL NOT FAINT BUT PLEAD FOR MERCY
WOULD YOU MARRY HER BUT WITH YOUR APPROBATION MY LORD
MISS FENTON IS A MOST AMIABLE YOUNG WOMAN AND WORTHY OF JUST SUCH A HUSBAND AS MY LORD ELMWOOD WILL MAKE HER I AM SURE SAID MISS WOODLEY MISS MILNER THINKS SO--SHE HAS A HIGH OPINION OF MISS FENTON--SHE WAS AT PRESENT ONLY JESTING BUT MADAM A JEST IS A VERY PERNICIOUS THING WHEN DELIVERED WITH A MALIGNANT SNEER
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT DISSIMILARITY OF OPINION WHICH IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE SUBSISTED BETWEEN MISS MILNER AND HER GUARDIAN THERE WAS IN GENERAL THE MOST PUNCTILIOUS OBSERVANCE OF GOOD MANNERS FROM EACH TOWARDS THE OTHER--ON THE PART OF DORRIFORTH MORE ESPECIALLY
BUT HER REASON TOLD HER SHE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR AS HE WAS AWAY
EXTREMELY HAPPY BUT FOR POOR DEBBY'S DEATH
AND OFTEN DID SHE FEEL SO VIOLENTLY INTERESTED IN HIS CAUSE THAT SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN GIVING AN ANSWER HERSELF IN HIS BEHALF--THUS DOING THE DUTY OF AN ADVERSARY WITH ALL THE ZEAL OF AN ADVOCATE
ON ARRIVING AT THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO ABATEMENT OF HER FELICITY
AND MISS MILNER NOW LABOURED UNDER THIS HUMILIATION TO A DEGREE WHICH GAVE HER NO SMALL INQUIETUDE
BUT HE HAD NOT EVEN MENTIONED MISS WOODLEY OF WHOM HE HAD SO LATELY SPOKEN IN THE KINDEST TERMS AND HAD SAID HE SHOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN SEEING HER AGAIN FROM THESE CONTRADICTIONS IN LORD ELMWOOD'S BEHAVIOUR IN RESPECT TO HER IT WAS MISS WOODLEY'S PLAN NEITHER TO THROW HERSELF IN HIS WAY NOR AVOID HIM
ARE HER DESIRES SO UNWARRANTABLE THAT I CANNOT GRANT THEM MISS WOODLEY AGAIN DID NOT SPEAK--AND HE CONTINUED GREAT AS MY FRIENDSHIP IS THERE ARE CERTAINLY BOUNDS TO IT--BOUNDS THAT SHALL SAVE HER IN SPITE OF HERSELF:"--AND HE RAISED HIS VOICE
FOR THE TUMULT OF HER MIND WOULD NOT SUFFER HER TO REMAIN INACTIVE AND SHE WAS ROUZED IN SPITE OF HER WEAKNESS TO ENDEAVOUR TO WARD OFF THE IMPENDING DISASTER
HE FIRST PLEASANTLY REPROACHED THE LADIES FOR NOT OFFERING HIM A PLACE IN THEIR BOX AT THE OPERA
AND AS NO ILL CONSEQUENCES HAD ARISEN FROM ITS PRACTICE HER SCRUPLES GRADUALLY CEASED
HORSES HAY FARMING AND POLITICS WON'T YOU SUP WITH HIM I SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN BEFORE I GO TO BED AND AGAIN TO-MORROW CRIED MATILDA WHAT HAPPINESS HE HAS VISITORS TO-MORROW SAID SANDFORD COMING FOR A WEEK OR TWO THANK HEAVEN SAID MISS WOODLEY HE WILL THEN BE DIVERTED FROM THINKING ON US DO YOU KNOW RETURNED SANDFORD IT IS MY FIRM OPINION THAT HIS THINKING OF YE AT PRESENT IS THE CAUSE OF HIS GOOD SPIRITS OH HEAVENS CRIED MATILDA LIFTING UP HER HANDS WITH RAPTURE
SHE WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE HIM AND PROMISED HERSELF FOR THIS LAST DAY TO NEGLECT NO ONE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING WITH HIM
AND WHENEVER HE ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO HIM GRATITUDE CHOAKED HIS UTTERANCE
TO WHICH SHE REPLIED I DON'T GO OUT TO-NIGHT DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
FOR HER DAUGHTER DID NOT EVEN REMEMBER HIS PROPOSALS SO AS TO REPEAT THEM AGAIN AND MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO CONCEAL FROM HER FRIEND EVERY NEW INCIDENT WHICH MIGHT GIVE HER CAUSE FOR NEW ANXIETIES
THE SERVANTS WHISPERED IT AND SOME OF THE PUBLIC PRINTS HAD EVEN FIXED THE DAY OF MARRIAGE;--BUT AS NO EXPLANATION HAD TAKEN PLACE ON HIS PART DORRIFORTH'S UNEASINESS WAS INCREASED AND HE SERIOUSLY TOLD HIS WARD HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INDISPENSABLY PRUDENT IN HER TO ENTREAT LORD FREDERICK TO DISCONTINUE HIS VISITS
FOR IF IT IS DICTATED BY YOU TO YOU I SHALL SEND THE ANSWER DORRIFORTH WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY OR CASTING A LOOK AT HIM PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND CALLED IN A VERY ANGRY TONE TO THE COACHMAN HOW DARE YOU NOT DRIVE ON WHEN YOUR LADY ORDERS YOU THE SOUND OF DORRIFORTH'S VOICE IN ANGER WAS TO THE SERVANTS SO UNUSUAL THAT IT ACTED LIKE ELECTRICITY UPON THE MAN AND HE DROVE ON AT THE INSTANT WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT LORD FREDERICK WAS IN A MOMENT LEFT MANY YARDS BEHIND
UNDER THE FIRST HE WAS ALL FRIENDSHIP AND TENDERNESS NOTWITHSTANDING MISS MILNER INDULGED HERSELF IN ALL THESE SOFT BEWAILINGS TO HER FRIEND--BEFORE LORD ELMWOOD SHE MAINTAINED A DEGREE OF PRIDE AND STEADINESS WHICH SURPRISED EVEN HIM WHO PERHAPS THOUGHT LESS OF HER LOVE FOR HIM THAN ANY OTHER PERSON
ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS LORD ELMWOOD WENT OUT TWO DAYS FOR A VISIT
I AM NOT SO HARD UPON YOU AS YOUR GUARDIAN
SHE WAS HAPPY RESPECTED FREE
I HAVE KNOWN A JEST DESTROY A LADY'S REPUTATION--I HAVE KNOWN A JEST GIVE ONE PERSON A DISTASTE FOR ANOTHER--I HAVE KNOWN A JEST BREAK OFF A MARRIAGE BUT I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO APPREHENSION OF THAT IN THE PRESENT CASE SAID MISS WOODLEY--WISHING HE MIGHT ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
DETEST MY NAME
BE HER HOST
DREADING TO RETURN WITH HIS DOUBTS UNSATISFIED AND YET AFRAID OF PROCEEDING TO EXTREMITIES THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED INTO PRESUMPTION HE WALKED DISCONSOLATELY ALMOST DISTRACTEDLY ABOUT THE FIELDS LOOKING REPEATEDLY AT HIS WATCH AND WISHING THE TIME WOULD STAND STILL TILL HE WAS READY TO GO BACK WITH HIS ERRAND COMPLEATED
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE BY THE SERVANT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE OFFENCE
IN A WORD EVERY CHANGE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ALL IS TRANSITORY ON THIS SIDE THE GRAVE GUIDED BY A WISH THAT THE REFLECTING READER MAY EXPERIENCE THE SENSATION WHICH AN ATTENTION TO CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE MUST EXCITE
HE KNEW NOT WHETHER TO PROCEED OR TO QUIT THE PATH AND PALPABLY SHUN THEM--TO ONE WHO SEEMED TO PUT AN UNKIND CONSTRUCTION UPON ALL HE SAID AND DID HE KNEW THAT TO DO EITHER WOULD BE TO DO WRONG
IF YOU RESOLVE ON THIS MY DEAR MISS MILNER YOU ARE UNDONE AT ONCE--YOU MAY THUS HURRY YOURSELF INTO A MARRIAGE WITH A MAN YOU DO NOT LOVE AND THE MISERY OF YOUR WHOLE FUTURE LIFE MAY BE THE RESULT
BUT THEN IT WON'T SUIT YOU--IT IS FOR A GENTLEMAN
ON THE DAY HE ARRIVED SHE WEPT--ALL THE NIGHT SHE DID NOT SLEEP--AND THE NAME OF RUSHBROOK AGAIN BECAME HATEFUL TO HER
WHY DID NOT YOU SPEAK TO HIM CRIED SANDFORD--"PRAY DID YOU BID HIM FAREWELL
NO RETURNED SANDFORD SOME PEOPLE CAN PUT ON WHAT LOOKS THEY PLEASE THEN WHILE HE LOOKS SO PALE REPLIED MATILDA AND SO DEJECTED I CAN NEVER FORBEAR SPEAKING TO HIM WHEN WE MEET WHATEVER HE MAY THINK OF IT AND WERE HE AND I TO MEET A HUNDRED NAY A THOUSAND TIMES RETURNED SANDFORD I DON'T THINK I SHOULD EVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN BLESS ME
1792
AND I DARE SAY IT IS MORE THAN YOUR GUARDIAN GIVES YOU CREDIT FOR DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL IT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ACTED CONTRARY TO THAT MISS MILNER REPLIED MRS HORTON AND AFFECTED A TENDERNESS OF VOICE TO SOFTEN THE HARSHNESS OF HER WORDS
HAVING BEEN TOLD THE NEWS HE CAME TO CONDOLE--BUT AT THE SIGHT OF HIM MATILDA WAS TERRIFIED AND CRIED DO NOT REPROACH ME DO NOT UPBRAID ME--I KNOW I HAVE DONE WRONG--I KNOW I HAD BUT ONE COMMAND FROM MY FATHER AND THAT I HAVE DISOBEYED SANDFORD COULD NOT REPROACH HER FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK
AND I DON'T SEE WHY ONE IS NOT AS MUCH TO BE BLAMED IN THAT RESPECT AS THE OTHER I WAS TOO WEAK TO SAY I WISHED HIM HAPPY CRIED MISS MILNER
HER GOOD WISHES DID NOT SUCCEED--YET HE WAS PERFECTLY UNRUFFLED AND REPLIED WITH COOLNESS THE AIR OF THE COUNTRY HAS AFFECTED THE LADY ALREADY--BUT IT IS A COMFORTABLE THING CONTINUED HE THAT IN THE VARIETY OF HUMOURS TO WHICH SOME WOMEN ARE EXPOSED THEY CANNOT BE UNIFORM EVEN IN DECEIT DECEIT CRIED MISS MILNER IN WHAT AM I DECEITFUL
IT DID NOT INDEED APPEAR SO FROM ANY PART OF HIS BEHAVIOUR BUT SHE WAS APPREHENSIVE FOR THE FATE OF MATILDA
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEAL THOSE UNFAVOURABLE SENTIMENTS ENTIRELY FROM MATILDA
AND I COULD OBEY HIM AS A HUSBAND
MY SENTIMENTS THOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE AVOWED THEM WERE LONG AGO FORMED
AND NEVER WOULD ONE WORD OF ANGER PASS ON EITHER SIDE
MANY THINGS HE BORE LIKE A MARTYR--AT OTHERS HIS FORTITUDE WOULD FORSAKE HIM AND HE WOULD CALL ON HER GUARDIAN HIS FORMER PUPIL TO INTERPOSE WITH HIS AUTHORITY
WHATEVER YOUR MEANING HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF IT IS WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED
AND OF LEARNING EITHER FROM MISS WOODLEY THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE THE NEIGHBOURS OR PERHAPS FROM LADY MATILDA'S OWN LIPS THE SECRET WHICH THE OBSTINACY OF SANDFORD HAD WITH-HELD
YOU LIKE HIM BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER LOVES HIM THIS WAS A HARD SENTENCE FOR THE DAUGHTER OF LORD ELMWOOD TO HEAR TO WHOM HER FATHER'S LOVE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PRECIOUS THAN ANY OTHER BLESSING.--SHE HOWEVER CHECKED THE ASSAULT OF ENVY AND KINDLY REPLIED MY MOTHER LOVED HIM TOO MR SANDFORD YES ANSWERED SANDFORD HE HAS BEEN A GRATEFUL MAN TO YOUR POOR MOTHER.--SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE WHEN SHE TOOK HIM INTO THE HOUSE
THE SUCCEEDING CIRCUMSTANCE PROVED SHE WAS MISTAKEN
UNSHAKEN BY THE ARGUMENTS PERSUASIONS AND MENACES OF SANDFORD HE GAVE AN ADDITIONAL PROOF OF THAT INFLEXIBILITY FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN LONG DISTINGUISHED--AND AFTER A DISPUTE OF TWO HOURS THEY PARTED NEITHER OF THEM THE BETTER FOR WHAT EITHER HAD ADVANCED BUT DORRIFORTH SOMETHING THE WORSE
THEN WOULD ASK HER PARDON AND SAY THAT HE REALLY DID NOT RECOLLECT HER WITH SUCH SEEMING SORROW FOR HIS FAULT THAT SHE COULD NOT THINK THE OFFENCE INTENDED AND OF COURSE FELT THE AFFRONT MORE ACUTELY
CHAPTER XIV
I CAME FROM THENCE JUST NOW AND THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM ALL DAY POOR MISS MILNER ON THIS ATE SOMETHING
BUT AS SHE ADMIRED FIRST HER OBJECTIONS AFTER HAD NO WEIGHT
WHO FROM MOTIVES OF DELICACY HAD PERMITTED HER TO SOLICIT AS A FAVOUR WHAT HE COULD HIMSELF MAKE A DEMAND LORD FREDERICK REDDENED WITH ANGER--HE LOVED MISS MILNER
BUT HOW WITHOUT FORFEITING EVERY APPEARANCE OF THAT RESPECT WHICH HE SO POWERFULLY FELT COULD HE ATTEMPT TO ENTER IT?--HE SAW THE INDECORUM RESOLVED NOT TO BE GUILTY OF IT AND YET WALKED ON TILL HE WAS WITHIN BUT A SMALL ORCHARD OF THE DOOR
1802
BUT WHAT GAVE HER PLEASURE BEYOND ANY OTHER ATTENTION WAS THAT AFTER SHE HAD TAKEN BY THE AID OF RUSHBROOK ABOUT A DOZEN VOLUMES FROM DIFFERENT SHELVES AND HAD LAID THEM TOGETHER SAYING SHE WOULD SEND HER SERVANT TO FETCH THEM
RUSHBROOK ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND WITH AN ACCENT AND MANNER THE MOST EXPRESSIVE SAID WE ARE COUSINS LADY MATILDA--IN OUR INFANCY WE WERE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER--WE WERE BELOVED BY THE SAME MOTHER--FOSTERED BY THE SAME FATHER OH CRIED SHE INTERRUPTING HIM WITH A TONE WHICH INDICATED THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
TO SUFFER HER TO ASK FOR A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH LORD ELMWOOD AND IF SHE FOUND HIM INFLEXIBLE TO BEHAVE WITH A PROPER SPIRIT IN RETURN
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE CERTAINLY BUT AN ALARMING PLEASURE TO HAVE KNOWN MRS INCHBALD
BUT THOUGH IT BROKE IN UPON HIS WORDS IT DID NOT ALTER ONE ANGRY LOOK--HIS EYES DARTED AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED WITH INDIGNATION
AT THIRTEEN SHE DECLARED SHE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LIVE LONGER WITHOUT SEEING THE WORLD
FORGIVE HER FAULTS AS THIS OF YOURS REQUIRES TO BE FORGIVEN HAD ANY ONE SAID THIS TO SANDFORD WHOM HE WOULD HAVE CREDITED OR HAD HIS OWN HEART SUGGESTED IT HE WAS A MAN OF THAT RECTITUDE AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS THAT HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO LORD ELMWOOD AND HAVE STRENGTHENED ALL HIS FAVOURABLE OPINIONS OF HIS INTENDED WIFE--BUT HAVING NO SUCH MONITOR HE WALKED ON HIGHLY CONTENTED AND MEETING MISS WOODLEY SAID WITH AN AIR OF TRIUMPH WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND
THERE ARE TICKETS FOR THREE AND YOU CAN THEN HAVE NO OBJECTION MISS MILNER'S BROW WAS IMMEDIATELY SMOOTHED
DO YOU SUSPECT ME OF PARTIALITY TO MR RUSHBROOK SAID SANDFORD ADVANCING NEARER TO THE EARL
AS IT WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN FELICITY UNBOUNDED IT WAS NOW--LANGUAGE AFFORDS NO WORD THAT CAN DESCRIBE LADY ELMWOOD'S SENSATIONS ON BEING TOLD HER LORD WAS ARRIVED AND THAT NECESSITY ALONE HAD SO LONG DELAYED HIS RETURN
AND THUS INSENSIBLY SURPRISED LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HER FATHER IN THE SWEETEST SLUMBER THAT IMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE
BUT AT THIS INSTANT GIFFARD WITH ANOTHER SERVANT PASSED BY THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
BUT WAS RESTRAINED TO PATIENCE BY SANDFORD'S ARGUMENTS AND THREATS
THE REPULSE LORD MARGRAVE RECEIVED DID NOT DIMINISH THE ARDOUR OF HIS PURSUIT
BUT WITH SUCH ADVICE AS YOU WILL HAVE FROM MR SANDFORD MINE WOULD BE BUT ASSUMING
SHE LEANED AGAINST HER MAID AS IF UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF UNDER THOSE FEELINGS AND SAID TO MISS WOODLEY MAKE MY EXCUSE--I CANNOT SEE HIM TO-NIGHT--I AM UNFIT--INDEED I CANNOT MISS WOODLEY WAS ALARMED AT THE IDEA OF GOING TO HIM BY HERSELF AND THUS PERHAPS IRRITATING HIM STILL MORE
SHE WAS PREVENTED THE TRIAL
BY THIS TIME HE HAD INVENTED ONE AND CONTINUING HIS LAUGH SAID MISS WOODLEY MY LORD WILL TO THIS DAY PROTEST THAT SHE SAW MY APPARITION WHEN I WAS A BOY
AND WAS BY HER TAUGHT THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF HER FATHER'S VIRTUES WHICH THEY JUSTLY MERITED
BUT A HAT LYING ON ONE OF THE TABLES GAVE HER A SENSATION BEYOND ANY OTHER SHE EXPERIENCED ON THIS OCCASION--IN THAT TRIFLING ARTICLE OF HIS DRESS SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW HIMSELF AND HELD IT IN HER HAND WITH PIOUS REVERENCE
AND DURING THE WHOLE TIME THEY HAD BEEN AT THEIR NEW ABODE THEY HAD NEVER ONCE HEARD OF HIM
WHILE THE LADIES REMAINED IN THE SAME ROOM WITH DORRIFORTH MISS MILNER THOUGHT OF LITTLE EXCEPT OF HIM
LORD ELMWOOD LAID DOWN THE NEWSPAPER TO ATTEND TO HER
ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD CRIED SPEAK ON SANDFORD--WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF OF YOU MY LORD HE STARTED
SHE THEREFORE RANG THE BELL AND ENQUIRED IF MR DORRIFORTH WAS STILL AT HOME?--THE ANSWER WAS--"HE HAD RODE OUT
DO NOT LET ME DRAW UPON HER ONE OATH MORE OF YOUR ETERNAL DISPLEASURE--I'LL KNEEL TO BEG THAT YOU WILL DROP THE SUBJECT THE INCLINATION HE MADE WITH HIS KNEES BENT TOWARDS THE GROUND STOPPED LORD ELMWOOD INSTANTLY
AND BEING DEVOTED TO THE SPORTS OF THE COUNTRY HE SELDOM QUITTED IT FOR ANY OF THOSE JOYS WHICH THE TOWN OFFERED
AND THE DAY WAS APPOINTED WITH HER SILENT ACQUIESCENCE WHEN SHE WAS TO ARRIVE IN LONDON AND THERE TAKE UP HER ABODE WITH ALL THE RETINUE OF A RICH HEIRESS
BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S
FOR AS I HAVE RESOLVED NEVER TO PERSECUTE YOU IN PITY BE GRATEFUL AND DO NOT PERSECUTE ME MISS MILNER LOOKED WITH SURPRISE THAT ANY THING SO LIGHTLY SAID SHOULD BE SO SERIOUSLY RECEIVED
BUT I WISHED FOR YOU--IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH ME I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A GREAT MANY OTHER THINGS
SHE IMAGINED THAT WHAT HE SAID MIGHT BE CENSURE AND SHE CONTINUED TO TREMBLE THOUGH HE REPEATEDLY ASSURED HER THAT HE MEANT ONLY TO ADVISE NOT UPBRAID HER
WHEN HE ENTERED--THE SIGHT OF HIM SEEMED TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HER AND AFTER THE FIRST GLANCE SHE TURNED HER HEAD AWAY
AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THE RELATIONS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER MISS MILNER HER GUARDIAN AND MISS WOODLEY DEPARTED FOR TOWN
NOR WOULD SHE TASTE A MORSEL OF ALL THE DELICACIES THAT WERE PREPARED FOR HER
THERE IS NO PROBABILITY OF HIS HEARING OF IT MADAM RUSHBROOK REPLIED
BUT NOT HAVING HAD FORBEARANCE TO AVOID AN OFFENCE I WILL NOT CLAIM AN EXEMPTION THAT WOULD ONLY INDEMNIFY ME FROM MAKING REPARATION YOU WILL THEN SIR MEET LORD FREDERICK AT THE APPOINTED HOUR SAID THE OFFICER
YOU CAN BUT TRY SIR MATILDA WAS ALL THIS WHILE BATHED IN TEARS
VIVACITY WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART NO IF IT CAME FROM THENCE I SHOULD ADMIRE IT TOO
SHE DEVOTED HERSELF TO READING AND TO DREAMS OF THE GREAT WORLD
LADY ELMWOOD TURNS TO HER OFTEN AND ATTEMPTS AN EMBRACE BUT HER FEEBLE ARMS FORBID AND THEY FALL MOTIONLESS
MR SANDFORD DID NOT APPEAR THE SAME
NOTHING BEYOND IMPLICATIONS HAVE PASSED BETWIXT HER FAMILY AND MYSELF AT PRESENT
HE FIRST WALKED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN THE ROOM--HE THEN BEGAN TO TAKE OFF SOME PART OF HIS DRESS BUT HE DID IT SLOWLY
FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SINCE MISS FENTON AND MR SANDFORD CAME TO TOWN I HAVE RECEIVED ONE TESTIMONY OF YOUR ESTEEM HAD THESE WORDS BEEN UTTERED WITH PLEASANTRY THEY MIGHT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT OBSERVATION
THE DINNER BEING THAT INSTANT SERVED HE GAVE NO GREATER MARKS OF HIS RESENTMENT THAN CALLING FOR HIS HAT AND WALKING INSTANTLY OUT OF THE HOUSE
SHE HAD ONLY THE CONFIDENCE TO OBSERVE HIM BY STEALTH
WHERE IS HE NOW MR SANDFORD GONE TO TAKE A WALK ABOUT HIS GROUNDS AND I STOLE HERE IN THE MEAN TIME WHAT WAS YOUR CONVERSATION DURING DINNER ASKED MISS WOODLEY
SHE SIGHS SHE TREMBLES AND IS CHILLED WITH TERROR
AND IT WAS AGREED AN APOLOGY SHOULD BE SENT TO MR RUSHBROOK THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD BEEN SUDDENLY INDISPOSED NOR COULD THIS BE SAID TO DIFFER FROM THE TRUTH FOR SINCE WHAT HAD PASSED SHE WAS UNFIT TO PAY A VISIT
WHEN IN 1770 ONE OF HER BROTHERS BECAME AN ACTOR AT NORWICH SHE WROTE SECRETLY TO HIS MANAGER MR GRIFFITH BEGGING FOR AN ENGAGEMENT
SHE FELT HERSELF TREMBLE--SHE IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD NOT ACTED PROPERLY AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
AND DO YOU IMAGINE I HAVE CHANGED MY DETERMINATION
BUT HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS I DO WISH HIM SO FROM MY SOUL AND DO YOU IMAGINE HE DOES NOT WISH YOU SO CRIED SANDFORD
EXCEPT SANDFORD WHO REMAINS MUCH THE SAME AS HERETOFORE
AND AS THIS IS A THEME THE MOST LIKELY OF ANY NAY THE ONLY ONE ON WHICH WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE SUCH AS WE CANNOT FORGIVE TAKE CARE NEVER FROM THIS DAY TO RESUME IT
I KNOW HER WORTH AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
SHE ENQUIRED HOWEVER OF HIS SERVANT HOW HE DID AND WAS REJOICED TO HEAR THAT HIS WOUND WAS BUT SLIGHT--YET THIS ENQUIRY SHE DURST NOT MAKE BEFORE MISS WOODLEY
THESE SENTIMENTS WERE REVERSED ON HIS PART TOWARDS HER--NO JEALOUSY INTERVENED TO BAR HIS ADMIRATION AND ESTEEM--THE BEAUTY OF HER PERSON AND GRANDEUR OF HER MIEN NOT ONLY CONFIRMED BUT IMPROVED THE EXALTED IDEA HE HAD FORMED OF HER PREVIOUS TO THEIR MEETING AND WHICH HIS AFFECTION TO BOTH HER PARENTS HAD INSPIRED
THE DAY ARRIVED ON WHICH SHE WAS TO LEAVE HER LATE FATHER'S SEAT AND FIX HER ABODE AT MRS HORTON'S
OR CAN EVER COMMAND HIM AND ALL HIS FORTUNES TO UNITE FOR HER WELFARE WITHOUT HIS READY HIS IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE AND DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY OF YOUR PROFESSIONS OR ANY OF HER NECESSITIES WOULD EVER PREVAIL UPON HER TO PUT YOU TO THE TRIAL PERHAPS NOT WHAT THEN ARE THE MOTIVES WHICH INDUCE YOU TO WISH HER TO BE TOLD OF THIS RUSHBROOK PAUSED
IN THE DISPOSAL OF THEMSELVES RESUMED HE WITH A LESS VEHEMENT TONE THAT GREAT THAT TERRIFIC DISPOSAL IN MARRIAGE AT WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED WITH FEAR AND DISMAY THERE IS NO ACCOUNTING FOR THE RASHNESS OF A WOMAN'S CHOICE OR SOMETIMES FOR THE DEPRAVITY OF HER TASTE
THEY HAD ONLY ONE MORE INTERVIEW BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE
HER HAIR OF A GOLDEN AUBURN HER EYES FULL AT ONCE OF SPIRIT AND SWEETNESS AND IT WAS ONLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ROMANCE AND DARING WOULD SOON GIVE PLACE TO DISCOMFORT AND ALARM
NOR SHALL ANY OTHER COMPANY BE ADMITTED BUT THOSE WHOM YOU APPROVE I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID HE
AND THEY MADE THEIR FIRST ATTACK BY URGING HIM TO TREAT ON THE SAME LEVEL OF FAMILIARITY THAT HE HIMSELF WAS TREATED MR SANDFORD TO WHOM HE HAD TILL NOW EVER BEHAVED WITH THE MOST PROFOUND TOKENS OF RESPECT
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X
CHAPTER X
THEY BOTH LOVED HIM SINCERELY
WHAT THEN IS TO BE SUBSTITUTED IN THE PLACE OF GENIUS
AND IF THE PERSON ON WHOM HE HAS FIXED HIS AFFECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE IN A SITUATION ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO MY WISHES I MAY PERHAPS CONFIRM HIS CHOICE THAT MOMENT SANDFORD'S COURAGE PROMPTED HIM TO NAME LADY MATILDA BUT HIS DISCRETION OPPOSED--HOWEVER IN THE VARIOUS CHANGES OF HIS COUNTENANCE FROM THE CONFLICT IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE WISHED TO SAY MORE THAN HE DARED
TEASED IF NOT TORTURED BY THIS LORD ELMWOOD STILL BEHAVED WITH A MANLY EVENNESS OF TEMPER AND NEITHER APPEARED PROVOKED ON THE SUBJECT NOR INSOLENTLY CARELESS
AND WHICH MIGHT URGE ME TO EXPRESS MYSELF OF LORD FREDERICK IN A MANNER MY COOLER THOUGHTS WILL NOT WARRANT THERE WAS NOTHING IN YOUR EXPRESSIONS MY DEAR MISS MILNER THE LEAST EQUIVOCAL--IF YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD WHEN YOU PLEADED FOR LORD FREDERICK AS I BELIEVE YOU WERE YOU SAID MORE SINCERELY WHAT YOU THOUGHT
HE TOOK UP HIS HAT WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM INTO THE ROOM AND WAS TURNING TO MISS WOODLEY TO TAKE HIS LEAVE WHEN SANDFORD CRIED MY LORD YOU ARE IN A GREAT HURRY AND THEN AS IF HE WISHED TO GIVE POOR MISS MILNER EVERY MOMENT HE COULD ADDED LOOKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE I HAVE LAID MY GLOVES LORD ELMWOOD AFTER REPEATING TO MISS WOODLEY HIS LAST NIGHT'S FAREWELL NOW WENT UP TO MISS MILNER AND TAKING ONE OF HER HANDS AGAIN HELD IT BETWEEN HIS BUT STILL WITHOUT SPEAKING--WHILE SHE UNABLE TO SUPPRESS HER TEARS AS HERETOFORE SUFFERED THEM TO FALL IN TORRENTS
HIS FIGURE WAS TALL AND ELEGANT BUT HIS FACE EXCEPT A PAIR OF DARK BRIGHT EYES A SET OF WHITE TEETH AND A GRACEFUL FALL IN HIS CLERICAL CURLS OF BROWN HAIR HAD NOT ONE FEATURE TO EXCITE ADMIRATION--YET SUCH A GLEAM OF SENSIBILITY WAS DIFFUSED OVER EACH THAT MANY PEOPLE MISTOOK HIS FACE FOR HANDSOME AND ALL WERE MORE OR LESS ATTRACTED BY IT--IN A WORD THE CHARM THAT IS HERE MEANT TO BE DESCRIBED IS A COUNTENANCE_--ON HIS YOU READ THE FEELINGS OF HIS HEART--SAW ALL ITS INMOST WORKINGS--THE QUICK PULSES THAT BEAT WITH HOPE AND FEAR OR THE GENTLE ONES THAT MOVED IN A MORE EQUAL COURSE OF PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION
WHEN THE THIRD DAY AT DINNER SOME GENTLEMEN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE BEING AT TABLE ONE OF THEM SAID AND SO MY LORD YOU ABSOLUTELY SET OFF ON TUESDAY MORNING THIS WAS FRIDAY
HE WAS ABOUT THIRTY AND HAD LIVED IN THE METROPOLIS NEAR FIVE YEARS WHEN A GENTLEMAN ABOVE HIS OWN AGE BUT WITH WHOM HE HAD FROM HIS YOUTH CONTRACTED A MOST SINCERE FRIENDSHIP DIED AND LEFT HIM THE SOLE GUARDIAN OF HIS DAUGHTER WHO WAS THEN EIGHTEEN
I WAS GOING MY DEAR--BUT DON'T BE CONCERNED--DON'T LET IT VEX YOU WHAT
THEN SAT DOWN TO THE SUPPER TABLE--SUPPED--AND PASSED THE WHOLE EVENING WITHOUT SAYING A SYLLABLE OR EVEN CASTING A LOOK IN REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT HAD PASSED IN THE MORNING
MISS WOODLEY AS THEY RODE ALONG MADE NO ATTEMPTS TO INGRATIATE HERSELF WITH MISS MILNER
SANDFORD THANKED GIFFARD FOR HIS FRIENDLY INFORMATION
UNDER THE FORCE OF THIS ASSAULT AND THE ASTONISHMENT IT EXCITED LORD FREDERICK STAGGERED AND LETTING FALL THE HAND OF MISS MILNER HER GUARDIAN IMMEDIATELY LAID HOLD OF IT AND LED HER INTO THE HOUSE
BUT THERE ARE OBJECTS ON WHOM ALL CARE IS FRUITLESS YOUR LORDSHIP WILL ALLOW I NEVER YET DESPAIRED OF ANY ONE MR SANDFORD AND YET THERE ARE PERSONS OF WHOM IT IS PRESUMPTION TO ENTERTAIN HOPES AND HE LOOKED AGAIN AT MISS MILNER
THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER;--RUSHBROOK EAT SCARCE ANY THING BUT DRANK FREQUENTLY
INDEED IT IS A CERTAIN RELIEF--I'LL FETCH IT INSTANTLY SHE WENT HASTILY OUT OF THE ROOM AND RETURNED WITH A BOTTLE WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM WAS A PRESENT FROM LADY LUNEHAM AND WOULD CERTAINLY CURE HIM AND SHE PRESSED IT UPON HIM WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT WITH ALL HIS CHURLISHNESS HE COULD NOT REFUSE TAKING IT
BUT HIS UNCLE TOOK HOLD OF EACH HAND WHICH HAD TWINED AROUND HIM AND PLACED HIM IMMEDIATELY ON THE GROUND
HE WAS SURPRISED BUT THE NOVELTY PLEASED HIM
WHEN SANDFORD EAGERLY JOINED IN DISCOURSE WHICH RELIEVED HIM FROM THE PAIN OF THE FORMER
BUT STILL HOLDING HER HAND HE CRIED I CANNOT PART FROM HER THEN FEELING THIS REPLY AS EQUIVOCAL HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND CRIED WILL YOU PARDON MY HESITATION
OR DOES SHE SUPPOSE ANY BODY HERE BEARS ENMITY TO HER IS SHE NOT IN PEACE AND CHARITY YES REPLIED MISS WOODLEY THAT I AM SURE SHE IS THEN BRING HER HITHER CRIED SANDFORD DIRECTLY
IN THE STRICT BUT NOT ENLARGED EDUCATION OF MISS WOODLEY IT WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FIRST--AND THE VIOLATION OF OATHS PERSONS OR THINGS CONSECRATED TO HEAVEN WAS IN HER OPINION IF NOT THE MOST ENORMOUS YET AMONG THE MOST TERRIFIC IN THE CATALOGUE OF CRIMES
BUT ALL THE SERVANTS SUPPOSE HER LADYSHIP WILL NOT BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN THERE ANY LONGER THEY ALL SUPPOSE WRONG RETURNED RUSHBROOK HASTILY--"MY LORD LOVES HER I AM CERTAIN AND THIS EVENT MAY BE THE HAPPY MEANS OF HIS TREATING HER AS HIS CHILD FROM THIS DAY THE SERVANT SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHAT YOU MY DEAR RETURNED MISS WOODLEY WHO NOT THREE HOURS AGO HAD THE COURAGE TO VINDICATE YOUR OWN CAUSE BEFORE A WHOLE COMPANY OF WHOM MANY WERE YOUR ADVERSARIES
I KNOW MISS MILNER CONTINUED HE THE WORLD IN GENERAL ALLOWS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN GREAT LATITUDE IN DISGUISING THEIR MIND WITH RESPECT TO THE MAN THEY LOVE
NOR HAVE YOU DISPOSED OF YOUR HEART NO MY LORD REPLIED HE
YES
YES
YES
SHE CAME
WHETHER HIS CONTINUANCE THERE WAS TO SHUN HER OR TO SHUN THE HOUSE FROM WHENCE HE HAD BANISHED HER
HEATED WITH THE WINE HE HAD DRANK AND WHICH SANDFORD ENGAGED ON HIS BOOK HAD NOT OBSERVED NO SOONER WAS HE ALONE THAN HE BECAME BY DEGREES COOL AND REPENTANT
THOUGH THE LADIES WERE ALL PRESENT DORRIFORTH SAID WITHOUT THE SMALLEST RESERVE PERHAPS MISS MILNER YOU MAY THINK I HAVE TAKEN AN UNWARRANTABLE LIBERTY IN GIVING ORDERS TO YOUR SERVANTS TO DENY YOU TO LORD FREDERICK
WITH THAT SAME DISREGARD TO CONSEQUENCES WHICH ACTUATED HIM WHEN HE DARED TO SUPPLICATE LORD ELMWOOD IN HIS DAUGHTER'S BEHALF HE AT LENGTH WENT EAGERLY TO THE DOOR AND RAPPED
WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED LADY EVANS
I WAS SHOWING MY LORD SOME PLANS FOR THE NEW WALKS AND TOLD HIM AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD MANY YEARS AGO APPROVED OF THEM
HE WAS EAGER SHE SHOULD BE HAPPY
HE WOULD NOT LOOK AT MISS MILNER AND WAS DISPLEASED WITH EVERY ONE
HE WAS AT A FARM HOUSE A FEW MILES FROM TOWN
ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER LORD ELMWOOD CAME INTO THE COUNTRY AS HE WAS RIDING ONE MORNING HIS HORSE FELL WITH HIM AND CRUSHED HIS LEG IN SO UNFORTUNATE A MANNER AS TO BE AT FIRST PRONOUNCED OF DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE
MISS MILNER NOW TREMBLED BEYOND ALL POWER OF CONCEALMENT
WHERE
UNFORTUNATELY THE GREATER PART OF WHAT WE SHOULD MOST LIKE TO KNOW OF MRS INCHBALD'S LIFE HAS VANISHED BEYOND RECOVERY
LORD ELMWOOD STOPPED HIMSELF SHORT IN HIS WALK AND SAID TO THE SERVANT YOU DID YES MY LORD REPLIED HE
HE OWNED HIS FAULT BUT NO ELOQUENCE COULD MAKE HIM RECALL THE PROMISE HE HAD GIVEN TO REPAIR THE INJURY
AND TURNING HER HEAD SUDDENLY SAW HER FRIEND'S FACE IMPRINTED WITH SUSPICION AND DISPLEASURE
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIS COMPOSED MIND DISTURBED WITH SUCH A THOUGHT--HIS STEADFAST PRINCIPLES SO MUCH AS SHAKEN BY THE IMAGINATION--NOR OVERWHELM HIM WITH THOSE SELF-REPROACHES WHICH HIS FATAL ATTRACTION UNPREMEDITATED AS IT WAS WOULD STILL HAVE DRAWN UPON HIM
AND SHE VAINLY ENDEAVOURED FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS TO CLOSE HER EYES
HE LISTENED WITH HOPE TO THE PRAISES OF HER FRIEND BUT SAW WITH DESPAIR HOW LITTLE THEY WERE MERITED
HAPPY BUT FOR SUSPICION AMOUNTING ALMOST TO CERTAINTY OF A RAPID APPEARANCE OF AGE IN MY FACE
GIVE ME LEAVE TO POINT OUT AN OBSERVATION WHICH PERHAPS I HAVE TOO FREQUENTLY MADE BEFORE BUT UPON THIS OCCASION I MUST INTRUDE IT ONCE AGAIN
IN THE MOMENT OF DESERTION CONTINUED HE WHICH I NOW PICTURE TO MYSELF WHERE WILL MY CHILD FIND COMFORT
FIRM IN HIS RESOLUTION THE BEAUTIFUL MATILDA WAS AT THE AGE OF SIX YEARS SENT OUT OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND RECEIVED BY HER MOTHER WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS BUT WITH ALL THE ANGUISH OF THOSE PARENTS WHO BEHOLD THEIR OFFSPRING VISITED BY THE PUNISHMENT DUE ONLY TO THEIR OWN OFFENCES
THE WHOLE WORLD IS WELCOME TO HEAR WHAT I SAY AND EVERY DIFFERENT PERSON IS WELCOME TO JUDGE ME DIFFERENTLY DEAR MISS MILNER,"--CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A TONE OF REPROACH FOR THE VEHEMENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN
HE OFFERED TO SPEAK IN MY BEHALF BUT MY LORD INTERRUPTED HIM AND ORDERED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM--HE INSTANTLY WENT SANDFORD NOW OBSERVING THE EFFECT WHICH THIS NARRATION HAD ON THE TWO LADIES LED THE MAN TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS AND THERE ASSURED HIM HE DARED NOT UNDERTAKE HIS CAUSE
AND I FEAR I HAVE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH RUSHBROOK NOW TREMBLED MORE THAN EVER AND LOOKED PALE AS DEATH
SINCE THE DEATH OF THE LATE EARL SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN TOWN
THE JOY HE FELT WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SO NEAR TO THE BELOVED OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY MADE HIM THANK SANDFORD IN HIS HEART FOR THE UNKINDNESS WHICH HAD SENT HIM THITHER
HE WAS BREAKFASTING BY HIMSELF WHEN THE NEWSPAPER THAT FIRST GAVE THE INTELLIGENCE OF LADY ELMWOOD'S DEATH WAS LAID BEFORE HIM--THE PARAGRAPH CONTAINED THESE WORDS
SANDFORD WAS NOW UNDER THE NECESSITY OF BEING IN RUSHBROOK'S COMPANY YET HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE WAS OBLIGED
YET SHE DID NOT SHEW LESS KINDNESS TO THE OBJECT OF THIS VEXATIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE
MISS FENTON OF COURSE WAS AS MUCH IN SORROW AS HER NATURE WOULD PERMIT HER TO BE AND BOTH SANDFORD AND DORRIFORTH IN EXTREME CONCERN UPON HIS LORDSHIP'S ACCOUNT
BUT WRITING TO SANDFORD THIS RESOLUTION HE WAS ONCE MORE REPULSED AND CHARGED AS A MAN OF HONOUR TO FORBEAR TO DISTURB THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE FAMILY BY ANY APPLICATION OF THE KIND
LOVER'S VOWS
THE CARE OF AN ONLY CHILD IS THE GREAT CHARGE THAT IN THIS TREMENDOUS CRISIS I HAVE TO EXECUTE
EVEN MISS WOODLEY WHOSE SPIRITS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME ELATED WITH THE HOPES SHE HAD FORMED ON DRAWING NEAR TO THE TEST FOUND THOSE HOPES VANISHED
BUT SUPPOSING WE COULD KNOW THEM WITHOUT PROOF BUT AS THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE ANSWERED HE I SHALL SUPPOSE TILL PROOF APPEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IN MY CONJECTURES MATILDA LOOKED DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE ARGUMENT SHOULD CONCLUDE IN HER DISAPPOINTMENT
A SIMPLE STORY
A SIMPLE STORY
A SIMPLE STORY
WHY HUSH CRIED MISS MILNER ALOUD THOUGH MISS WOODLEY HAD SPOKEN IN A WHISPER I AM SURE CONTINUED SHE I AM ONLY REPEATING WHAT I HAVE READ IN BOOKS ABOUT NUNS AND THEIR CONFESSORS YOUR CONDUCT MISS MILNER REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD GIVES EVIDENT PROOFS OF THE AUTHORS YOU HAVE READ
IN AN INSTANT HE FOUND MEANS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT BUT THAT OF HIS JOURNEY STILL EMPLOYED THE CONVERSATION
AS SOON HOWEVER AS HE RECOVERED FROM THE SURPRISE INTO WHICH THIS SUDDEN COMMAND HAD THROWN HIM HE RODE WITH SPEED AFTER THE CARRIAGE AND FOLLOWED IT TILL IT ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF MISS MILNER'S HOUSE
FOR SHOULD HE ALLOW IT YOU AT THE EXPIRATION YOUR DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS WILL BE LESS PARDONABLE THAN IT IS NOW WITHIN A YEAR MR SANDFORD WHO CAN TELL WHAT STRANGE EVENTS MAY NOT OCCUR TO CHANGE ALL OUR PROSPECTS
HER GUARDIAN SEES HIS CARRIAGE COMING UP THE AVENUE AND GIVES ORDERS TO THE SERVANTS TO SAY THEIR LADY IS NOT AT HOME BUT THAT MR DORRIFORTH IS
AND THAT BEFORE HE COULD PROCEED A WORD FURTHER HIS UNCLE LEFT THE ROOM HASTILY--AND LEFT RUSHBROOK ALL TERROR FOR HIS APPROACHING FATE
TILL ROMONO THE MARQUIS OF ROMONO CAME FROM THE FIELD OF GLORY AND WITH SUPERIOR CLAIMS OF PERSON AS OF FAME SEIZED ON MY HEART BY FORCE AND PERFORCE MADE ME FEEL I HAD NEVER LOVED TILL THEN WHICH IS THE MORE SURPRISING--THAT ACTORS COULD BE FOUND TO UTTER SUCH SPEECHES OR THAT AUDIENCES COULD BE COLLECTED TO APPLAUD THEM
OR NOT ESCAPING IT WERE LAMENTED WITH A SIGH OF COMPASSION OR A CONTEMPTUOUS FROWN AT SUCH FRIVOLOUS QUALIFICATIONS
NEVER WERE THE FRIENDLY EXPRESSIONS OF HIS UNCLE HALF SO WELCOME TO HIM
IF I FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU MY LORD CONTINUED HE GRATITUDE IS INNATE IN MY HEART AND I MUST ALSO FEEL IT TOWARDS HER WHO FIRST INTRODUCED ME TO YOUR PROTECTION AGAIN THE COLOUR FLEW TO LORD ELMWOOD'S FACE
SHE DREW HER CHAIR AND SAT DOWN WITH AN INDIFFERENCE THAT SAID SHE SHOULD NOT EAT
THIS WAS BUT A COMMON-PLACE CIVILITY SUCH AS IS PAID BY ONE ENEMY TO ANOTHER EVERY DAY
IT WAS HIS DUTY TO FORGIVE RUSHBROOK AND HE DID SO--BUT HE HAD DECLARED HE WOULD NEVER BE AGAIN IN HIS COMPANY UNLESS LORD ELMWOOD WAS PRESENT AND WITH ALL HIS FORGIVENESS HE FOUND AN UNFORGIVING GRATIFICATION IN THE DUTY OF BEING OBLIGED TO KEEP HIS WORD
HE THEN BOWED MOST RESPECTFULLY AND LEFT HER
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF A SIMPLE STORY BY MRS INCHBALD
THE CARRIAGE DROVE UP THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND LORD MARGRAVE ASHAMED TO BE EXPOSED BEFORE HIS ATTENDANTS AND CONVINCED OF THE INUTILITY OF REMAINING ANY LONGER WHERE HE WAS DEPARTED
BUT THE COLDNESS OF THE FORMER AND THE HAUGHTINESS OF THE LATTER STILL KEPT HIM AT A DISTANCE AND AGAIN MADE HIM FEAR TO GIVE ONE ALLUSION TO HIS PURPOSE
HER DECLINING SPIRITS RETURNED AS BEFORE
SO THERE ARE NO TORTURES WHICH A LOVER WOULD NOT SUFFER RATHER THAN CEASE TO LOVE
SHE WAS CHARMED TO SEE HIS LOVE STRUGGLING WITH HIS CENSURE--HIS POLITENESS WITH HIS ANXIETY--AND BY THE LIGHT FRIVOLOUS OR RESENTFUL MANNER IN WHICH SHE TREATED HIS ADMONITIONS SHE TRIUMPHED IN SHEWING TO MISS WOODLEY AND MORE ESPECIALLY TO MR SANDFORD HOW MUCH SHE DARED UPON THE STRENGTH OF HIS AFFECTIONS
FOR TWO DAYS ALL THE SCHEMES HE FORMED ON THAT HEAD PROVED FRUITLESS
I'LL KEEP IT AND GIVE IT TO MY LORD FREDERICK THE FIRST TIME I MEET WITH HIM
ALL I DO IS TO MENTION THEM AGAIN THE GOOD-NATURED MISS WOODLEY WHO SAT WORKING AT THE WINDOW AN HUMBLE BUT AN ATTENTIVE LISTENER TO THIS DISCOURSE VENTURED HERE TO SAY EXACTLY SIX WORDS
OH MISS WOODLEY EXCLAIMS MISS MILNER FORCED AT LAST TO CONFESS TO HER FRIEND WHAT SHE FEELS TOWARDS DORRIFORTH I LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE PASSION OF A MISTRESS AND WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS OF A WIFE NO YOUNG LADY EVEN IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EVER GAVE UTTERANCE TO SUCH A SENTENCE AS THAT
AND WITH YOUR COMPASSION WHICH SHE IS ABOVE DID SHE COMPLAIN TO YOU SHE OR HER FRIEND DID I RATHER SUPPOSE MR SANDFORD THAT YOU HAVE BRIBED SOME OF THE SERVANTS TO REVEAL THIS THE SUSPICION BECOMES LORD ELMWOOD'S HEIR IT BECOMES THE MAN WHO LIVES IN A HOUSE WITH YOU I THANK YOU MR RUSHBROOK FOR WHAT HAS PASSED THIS DAY--IT HAS TAKEN A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND
STILL THOSE SENTIMENTS OR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXPLICITLY DELIVERED
HE RESUMED--"HOW CAN I DOUBT OF A LADY'S VIRTUES WHEN HER COUNTENANCE GIVES ME SUCH EVIDENT PROOFS OF THEM
AND THE UTILITY OF THE MARRIAGE IN PERFECT SUBMISSION TO HIS PRECEPTS HE NEVER PERMITTED HIMSELF TO QUESTION
THIS WAS PAINFUL TO HIM UPON MANY ACCOUNTS
AND HE WAS AT TIMES SO MOVED BY THOSE MARKS OF KINDNESS HE RECEIVED THAT HE WOULD FORM THE INTENTION OF TEARING FROM HIS HEART EVERY TRACE THAT LADY MATILDA HAD LEFT THERE AND AS SOON AS HIS HEALTH WOULD PERMIT HIM OBEY TO THE UTMOST OF HIS VIEWS EVERY WISH HIS UNCLE HAD CONCEIVED
LORD ELMWOOD HAD NOW ALLOWED RUSHBROOK A LONG VACATION IN RESPECT TO HIS ANSWER UPON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE
THIS WAS ANOTHER INDULGENCE
IT WAS TO OFFER HER MY SERVICES--IT WAS MISS WOODLEY TO CONVINCE HER IF POSSIBLE OF MY ESTEEM HAD YOU NO OTHER METHOD SIR SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH THE SAME RESERVE
BUT WHEN WILLIAM PLACED THE FATAL VELVET ON HIS HEAD AND ROSE TO PRONOUNCE SENTENCE SHE STARTED WITH A KIND OF CONVULSIVE MOTION RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK AND LIFTING UP HER HANDS WITH A SCREAM EXCLAIMED OH NOT FROM YOU THE PIERCING SHRIEK WHICH ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS PREVENTED THEIR BEING HEARD BY PART OF THE AUDIENCE
NONE REPLIED HE OR WITH JOY I SHOULD HAVE EMBRACED IT
MISS WOODLEY FELT HERSELF GREATLY RELIEVED
THE SCHEME CAME TO NOTHING AND THE INCHBALDS EVENTUALLY WENT TO HULL WHERE THEY RETURNED TO THEIR OLD PROFESSION
SLIGHT AS WAS THIS SUSPICION IT DID RUSHBROOK INJUSTICE
MISS WOODLEY OBSERVING THIS SAID MR RUSHBROOK LET IT BE A TOKEN WE SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU HEREAFTER THAT I NOW USE THE FREEDOM TO BEG YOU WILL PUT AN END TO YOUR VISIT YOU SEND ME AWAY MADAM RETURNED HE WITH THE WARMEST THANKS FOR THE RECEPTION YOU HAVE GIVE ME
UPON THE SUBJECT OF THIS MARRIAGE SANDFORD MET HIS PATRON WITHOUT HAVING DETERMINED EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY BUT RESTED ON THE TEMPER IN WHICH HE SHOULD FIND HIM
BUT BEFORE WE BID ADIEU TO THE SUBJECT FOR EVER MY LORD--THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WHOM I NAMED TO YOU DO YOU MEAN MISS WOODLEY
AT THIS JUNCTURE MR SANDFORD ENTERED
FOR HIS SAKE I HAVE BORNE A GREAT DEAL--FOR HIS SAKE ALONE HIS DAUGHTER DIED MY WIFE
IN THE ARDOUR OF HIS DESIGNS HE WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MISS MILNER'S--ENTERED THAT HOUSE WHICH HE HAD SO LONG REFUSED TO ENTER AND AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS UPON AGGRAVATED BAD TERMS WITH ITS OWNER
SHE HAD NO WILL SHE SAID BUT WHAT SHE WOULD WHOLLY SUBMIT TO LORD ELMWOOD'S
MISS MILNER WAS VEXT--SHE WAS ALARMED--BUT WAS ASHAMED TO CONFESS THOSE HUMILIATING SENSATIONS EVEN TO MISS WOODLEY--SHE SUPPORTED THEREFORE WHEN IN COMPANY THE VIVACITY SHE HAD SO LONG ASSUMED
AND YET WITH ALL HIS VAST SHARE OF PRUDENCE HE SHALL FORGIVE IT AND MAKE A SACRIFICE OF JUST RESENTMENT TO PARTIAL AFFECTION BUT IF YOU SHOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND HE SHOULD NOT MAKE THE SACRIFICE SAID MISS WOODLEY
HAD SHE BEEN EARLY TAUGHT WHAT WERE THE SACRED FUNCTIONS OF A ROMAN ECCLESIASTIC THOUGH ALL HER ESTEEM ALL HER ADMIRATION HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE QUALITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HER GUARDIAN YET EDUCATION WOULD HAVE GIVEN SUCH A PROHIBITION TO HER LOVE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PRECLUDED FROM IT AS BY THAT BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES A SISTER FROM A BROTHER
I AM SURE YOUR LORDSHIP SAID SHE WITH ALL YOUR SAINTLINESS CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION TO MY BEING PRESENT AT THE MASQUERADE IF I GO AS A NUN HE MADE NO REPLY
TWO WEEKS PASSED AWAY IN THIS KIND OF DISTANT BEHAVIOUR ON BOTH SIDES WITHOUT EITHER OF THEM VENTURING A DIRECT QUARREL AND WITHOUT EITHER OF THEM EXPRESSING EXCEPT INADVERTENTLY THEIR STRONG AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER
SUCH THINGS ARE A PLAY IN FIVE ACTS
ENTRANCED IN THE HAPPINESS OF HER SOCIETY THE THOUGHT OF HIS RIVAL NEVER CAME ONCE TO HIS MIND WHILE HE WAS WITH HER
TO WHICH HOW FEW DO NOT FALL A SACRIFICE
SHE IS ESSENTIALLY A STYLIST--A WRITER WHOSE WHOLE CONCEPTION OF HER ART IS DOMINATED BY STYLISTIC INTENTION
WHILE I MAY POSSIBLY BE SPEAKING OF A MERE PHANTOM THAT HAS LED THIS YOUNG MAN ASTRAY WHATEVER IT BE RETURNED LORD ELMWOOD LET HIM AND HIS FRIENDS WEIGH THE CASE WELL AND ACT FOR THE BEST--SO SHALL I HIS FRIENDS MY LORD?--WHAT FRIENDS OR WHAT FRIEND HAS HE UPON EARTH BUT YOU THEN WHY WILL HE NOT SUBMIT TO MY ADVICE
AND AS PERSONS ENJOY THE REFLECTION OF HAVING IN THEIR POSSESSION SOME VALUABLE GEM THOUGH THEY ARE DETERMINED NEVER TO USE IT SO SHE UPON THIS WAS COMFORTED AND GREW BETTER
APPEARANCE IS AGAINST THEM
AND AS SANDFORD SELDOM DISGUISED HIS FEELINGS TO RUSHBROOK HE WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY SEVERE AND SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
HOW ARE YOU MR SANDFORD SHE RETURNED WITH A SIGH
YOU SHALL HAVE A LETTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER I GET HOME AS IF HE GUESSED WHAT ITS CONTENTS WERE TO BE HE CRIED OUT WITH WARMTH TAKE CARE THEN MADAM HOW YOU TREAT ME IN THAT LETTER--AND YOU MR DORRIFORTH TURNING TO HIM DO YOU TAKE CARE WHAT IT CONTAINS
SHE AND MISS WOODLEY HAD TAKEN AN AIRING TO SEE THE POOR CHILD YOUNG RUSHBROOK
SHE SOON RETURNED AND SAID APART HE IS NOW GETTING INTO HIS CHARIOT
SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MRS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
SANDFORD IMMEDIATELY BADE HIS COMPANIONS GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT THEM
MY LORD SAID SANDFORD BOLDLY TO HIM HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY ENCOURAGEMENT FROM LADY MATILDA TO AUTHORIZE THIS VISIT NONE UPON MY HONOUR MR SANDFORD
AND NOW RESUMED LORD ELMWOOD IN A MORE STERN VOICE LET ME NEVER HEAR AGAIN ON THIS SUBJECT
ONE MORNING HOWEVER AS SHE WAS CROSSING THE LARGE HALL THOUGHTLESS OF DANGER A FOOTSTEP AT A DISTANCE ALARMED HER ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
SHE THEN ROSE:--EVERY ONE WHO WAS PRESENT ATTENTIVE TO WHAT HE WOULD NOW SAY AND HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE WHAT HE SAID HERE CAST THEIR EYES UPON THEM AND LISTENED WITH IMPATIENCE
YOU SHOULD JUDGE HIM BY YOUR OWN HEART
IV-CHAPTER VIII 283 IV-CHAPTER IX 285 IV-CHAPTER X 288 IV-CHAPTER XI 291 IV-CHAPTER XII 293 INTRODUCTION A SIMPLE STORY IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS WHICH FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER HAVE FAILED TO COME DOWN TO US AS THEY DESERVED ALONG THE CURRENT OF TIME BUT HAVE DRIFTED INTO A LITERARY BACKWATER WHERE ONLY THE PROFESSIONAL CRITIC OR THE CURIOUS DISCOVERER CAN FIND THEM OUT
BUT I COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITHOUT SEEING YOUR LORDSHIP ONCE AGAIN WHILE I HAD IT IN MY POWER I THANK YOU HE RETURNED WITH A SIGH--THE HEAVIEST AND MOST INTELLIGENT SIGH SHE EVER HEARD HIM CONDESCEND TO GIVE
THAT WHOLE DAY AND NIGHT WAS PASSED IN SYMPATHETIC GRIEF IN ALARM AT EVERY SOUND LEST IT SHOULD BE A MESSENGER TO PRONOUNCE MATILDA'S DESTINY
THE TEA HAD SCARCE BEEN MADE WHEN A SERVANT CAME WITH MISS MILNER'S COMPLIMENTS AND SHE DID NOT MEAN TO HAVE ANY TEA THE PAMPHLET SHOOK IN DORRIFORTH'S HAND WHILE THIS MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED--HE BELIEVED HER TO BE DRESSING FOR HER EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT AND NOW STUDIED IN WHAT MANNER HE SHOULD PREVENT OR RESENT HER DISOBEDIENCE TO HIS COMMANDS
SHE HAS RECEIVED THE FIRST FOND IMPULSE OF HIS HEART AND HAS HAD THE TRANSCENDENT HAPPINESS OF TEACHING HIM TO LOVE BY NO MEANS RETURNED MISS WOODLEY FINDING NO OTHER SUGGESTION LIKELY TO COMFORT HER
LORD MARGRAVE BLACK AS THIS INCIDENT OF HIS LIFE MUST MAKE HIM APPEAR TO THE READER STILL NURSED IN HIS CONSCIENCE A RESERVE OF SPECIOUS VIRTUE TO KEEP HIM IN PEACE WITH HIMSELF
PERHAPS MISS MILNER SAID DORRIFORTH YOU WILL NOT NOW REPLY TO THOSE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO PUT DID I EVER REFUSE SIR RETURNED SHE WITH A SELF-APPROVING AIR TO COMPLY WITH ANY REQUEST THAT YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY MADE
SOMETIMES HE LEFT THE ROOM HALF DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE--BUT THESE WERE ALL HALF DETERMINATIONS
AND TO HAVE SEEN HER DISTORTED WITH RAGE CONVULSED WITH MIRTH OR IN DEEP DEJECTION HAD BEEN TO HER ADVANTAGE
HE MAY YET HAVE AN HEIR FOR HE WILL CERTAINLY MARRY MARRY CRIED THE BARONET
THE TIME RAN SO SWIFTLY WHILE HE WAS AWAY THAT IT WAS BEYOND THE DINNER HOUR AT ELMWOOD HOUSE WHEN HE RETURNED
I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO ACT AS IF I DID REPLIED SANDFORD
NAY SHAME TO HIM IF HE IS NOT IN LOVE"--ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP FOR WHO BUT A SAVAGE COULD BEHOLD BEAUTY LIKE HER'S WITHOUT OWNING ITS POWER HABIT REPLIED MISS MILNER IS EVERY THING--MR DORRIFORTH SEES AND CONVERSES WITH BEAUTY BUT FROM HABIT HE DOES NOT FALL IN LOVE
AND WILL SHE NOT TO-MORROW DISAVOW WHAT SHE SAYS TO-DAY I WISH THAT SHE MAY REPLIED DORRIFORTH MILDLY FOR HE SAW THE TEARS FLOWING DOWN HER FACE AT THE ROUGH AND SEVERE MANNER IN WHICH SANDFORD HAD SPOKEN AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL FOR HER UNEASINESS
CAN I THEN LEAVE HER TO THE CHARGE OF THOSE WHO THEMSELVES NEVER REMEMBER SUCH AN HOUR WILL COME
WHETHER THIS AROSE FROM PURE MELANCHOLY OR THE STILL LINGERING HOPE OF MAKING HER CONQUEST BY THAT SEDATENESS OF MANNERS WHICH SHE KNEW HER GUARDIAN ADMIRED SHE HERSELF PERHAPS DID NOT PERFECTLY KNOW
WHEN MISS MILNER RETIRED TO HER BED-CHAMBER MISS WOODLEY WENT WITH HER NOR WOULD LEAVE HER THE WHOLE NIGHT--BUT IN VAIN DID SHE PERSUADE HER TO REST--SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED
BY WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS PROMISE NOT TO ENDANGER HIS LORDSHIP'S LIFE AND HAD RECONCILED SANDFORD IN GREAT MEASURE TO HIS BEHAVIOUR--AND SANDFORD NOW HIS RESOLUTION ONCE BROKEN NO LONGER REFUSED ENTERING MISS MILNER'S HOUSE BUT CAME WHENEVER IT WAS CONVENIENT THOUGH HE YET AVOIDED THE MISTRESS OF IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY THE HAND AND SAID TO LORD ELMWOOD MY LORD WHAT'S THE MATTER THAT UNGRATEFUL VILLAIN CRIED HE HAS DARED TO INSULT ME.--LEAVE MY HOUSE THIS MOMENT SIR RUSHBROOK MADE AN EFFORT TO GO BUT SANDFORD STILL HELD HIS HAND
ALL THE DAY WAS PASSED IN ANXIOUS EXPECTATION BY MISS MILNER WHAT WOULD BE THE EVENT OF THE EVENING
AND SANDFORD WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS QUESTION SAID TO THE SERVANT WHO TOOK HIS HORSE SHE HAS COME A LONG WAY THIS MORNING
I CAN'T ANSWER EXACTLY FOR THAT REPLIED HE BUT I KNOW SHE HAD BOOTS ON THEY WERE NOT BOOTS REPLIED THE MAID WITH VEHEMENCE--"INDEED SIR TURNING TO SANDFORD THEY WERE ONLY HALF BOOTS MY GIRL SAID SANDFORD KINDLY TO HER YOUR OWN EVIDENCE CONVICTS YOUR MISTRESS--WHAT HAS A WOMAN TO DO WITH ANY BOOTS IMPATIENT AT THIS MUMMERY LORD ELMWOOD ROSE ORDERED THE SERVANTS OUT OF THE ROOM AND THEN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH FOUND IT WAS NEAR ONE
I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH YOU UPON BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED I WILL SIR AND HER EYES SWAM WITH DELIGHT IN EXPECTATION OF THE INTERVIEW
NOR WILL I EVER THINK OF MARRIAGE OR ANY OTHER JOYFUL PROSPECT WHILE YOU ABANDON THE ONLY CHILD OF MY BELOVED PATRONESS AND LOAD ME WITH RIGHTS WHICH BELONG TO HER HERE RUSHBROOK STOPPED--LORD ELMWOOD WAS SILENT TOO FOR NEAR HALF A MINUTE
AND AS THAT DEPENDED MERELY UPON HIS OBTAINING HER HE CARED NOT BY WHAT METHOD IT WAS EFFECTED
BUT SIR EDWARD WAS EITHER SO UNWILLING TO GIVE PAIN TO THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE OR SO INTIMIDATED BY HER FROWNS THAT HE SELDOM ADDRESSED HER WITH A SINGLE WORD EXCEPT THE USUAL COMPLIMENTS AT ENTERING AND RETIRING
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAIN HE SUFFERED HIS FEVER WAS ONE NIGHT VERY HIGH
SHE DID NOT WEEP BUT SHE CALLED MISS WOODLEY TO COME TO HER WITH A VOICE THAT INDICATED A DEGREE OF AGONY
FOR AS HE WAS NO LONGER AFRAID OF RESENTMENT FROM THE EARL WHATEVER TREATMENT HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT RECEIVE HE WAS DETERMINED THE ANGER OF LADY MATILDA OR OF HER FEMALE FRIEND SHOULD NOT IMPEDE HIS PRETENSIONS
SAYING ONLY HE WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED AND EVEN DEJECTED AT THE LITTLE HOPE THERE WAS OF HIS COUSIN LORD ELMWOOD'S RECOVERY SHORT AND TRIVIAL AS THIS PASSAGE WAS IT WAS STILL MORE IMPORTANT TO MISS MILNER THAN ANY OTHER IN THE LETTER--SHE READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN CONSIDERED AND REFLECTED UPON IT
SUCH REPLIED HE AS THE DUKE OF AVON MADE TO HER MOTHER MISS WOODLEY QUITTED THE ROOM THAT INSTANT
THIS INCONGRUITY OF BEHAVIOUR MISS WOODLEY OBSERVED AND WAS CONFOUNDED--BUT DORRIFORTH IN WHOSE THOUGHTS A SUSPICION EITHER OF HER LOVE FOR HIM OR INDIFFERENCE FOR LORD FREDERICK HAD NO PLACE EASILY RECONCILED THIS INCONSISTENCY AND SAID YOU SEE BY MY COUNTENANCE THAT ALL IS WELL AND THEREFORE YOU SMILE ON ME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT HAS PASSED THIS BROUGHT HER TO THE RECOLLECTION OF HER CONDUCT AND NOW WITH LOOKS ILL CONSTRAINED SHE ATTEMPTED THE EXPRESSION OF AN ALARM SHE DID NOT FEEL
IN THE NAME OF GOD SAID HE TO LADY ELMWOOD OF THAT GOD WHO SUFFERED FOR YOU AND SUFFERING KNEW AND PITIED ALL OUR WEAKNESSES--BY HIM WHO HAS GIVEN HIS WORD TO TAKE COMPASSION ON THE SINNER'S TEARS I BID YOU HOPE FOR MERCY
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS ENFORCED BY MY REQUEST THAT YOU WILL COME TO US AS SOON AS YOU CAN WITH PROPRIETY LEAVE LADY LUNEHAM
ALTHOUGH DORRIFORTH WAS THE GOOD MAN THAT HE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THERE WERE IN HIS NATURE SHADES OF EVIL--THERE WAS AN OBSTINACY WHICH HE HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS TERMED FIRMNESS OF MIND
LORD ELMWOOD'S CARRIAGE DROVE TO HIS DOOR JUST AT THE TIME HER'S DID
BUT I CALL IT A BREACH OF CONFIDENCE--IF IT WAS DIVULGED TO ME IN CONFIDENCE HE WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN
MATILDA HAD THE UNDERSTANDING TO IMAGINE THAT SHE WAS PERHAPS THE OBJECT WHO HAD THUS DEFORMED MR RUSHBROOK AND FREQUENTLY THOUGH HE WAS A STRANGER TO HER AND ONE WHO HAD CAUSED HER MANY A JEALOUS HEART-ACHE FREQUENTLY SHE WOULD SPEAK IN HIS VINDICATION
HE INDEED HAD LITTLE ELSE TO FEAR FROM THE KNOWN FIRM COURAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND THE EXPEDITION WITH WHICH HE UNDERTOOK HIS JOURNEY
HIS RELIGIOUS STUDIES HAD COMPLETELY TAUGHT HIM TO CONSIDER THIS WORLD BUT AS A PASSAGE TO ANOTHER
THE MAN ANSWERED YES MADAM
1797
LORD ELMWOOD HAD DISCOVERED ALL THAT BEAUTY IN MISS FENTON WHICH EVERY COMMON OBSERVER COULD NOT BUT SEE
I DO NOT THINK MY LORD FREDERICK WOULD MAKE THE PASSION APPEAR IN MORE PLEASING COLOURS BY PAINTING ITS DELIGHTS THAN MR DORRIFORTH COULD IN DESCRIBING ITS SORROWS--AND IF HE TALKS TO ME FREQUENTLY IN THIS MANNER I SHALL CERTAINLY TAKE PITY ON LORD FREDERICK FOR THE SAKE OF HIS ADVERSARY'S ELOQUENCE MISS WOODLEY WHO HEARD THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SPEECH WITH THE TENDEREST CONCERN CRIED ALAS
IS IT POSSIBLE I CAN RETURN IMPERTINENCE TO THE LANGUAGE AND MANNERS WHICH MR DORRIFORTH USES
BUT MISS MILNER AND MISS WOODLEY KNEW HIS AGITATION TO ARISE FROM A FAR DIFFERENT CAUSE
IN THE ZEAL OF THOSE SENSATIONS HE LAID HOLD OF HER HAND AND HELD IT BETWEEN HIS--THIS HE DID NOT HIMSELF KNOW--BUT SHE DID
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID SHE I DID NOT KNOW YOU
I AM WEAK I AM VOLATILE I AM INDISCREET BUT I HAVE A HEART FROM WHICH SOME IMPRESSIONS CAN NEVER--OH
JUST AS THE DINNER WAS GOING TO BE REMOVED A LOUD RAP CAME AT THE DOOR--"WHO IS THAT SAID MRS HORTON
BUT VAIN WAS HER BEAUTY
BE THIS AS IT MAY HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY ON THE OCCASION WAS NOT SUSPECTED BY ANY ONE--YET HE PASSED THAT DAY THE SAME AS USUAL
MR SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY DID YOU USE ALL THOSE DROPS MISS MILNER GAVE YOU FOR A PAIN IN THE HEAD YES ANSWERED HE I DID BUT THE QUESTION AT THAT MOMENT SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED HIM
AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM--HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE THE BEHAVIOUR OF A PERSON IN LOVE NO DOUBT ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY
DINNER WAS THEN IMMEDIATELY SERVED AND LORD ELMWOOD APPEARED MUCH IN HIS USUAL SPIRITS
HE ANSWERED AND DID YOU KNOW SOME OF MINE YOU MIGHT THINK THEM EQUALLY UNPARDONABLE SHE TURNED PALE AND COULD NO LONGER GUIDE HER NEEDLE--IN THE FOND TRANSPORT OF HER HEART SHE IMAGINED THAT HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS AMONG THE SENSATIONS TO WHICH HE ALLUDED
HE TREMBLED--WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK HE STAMMERED--HE PERCEIVED HIS FACE BURNING WITH CONFUSION AND THUS ONE CONFUSION GAVE BIRTH TO ANOTHER TILL HIS STATE WAS PITIABLE
IT WAS TOO LATE TO HESITATE WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
AT DINNER MRS HORTON SAID SHE HOPED HE WOULD HOWEVER FAVOUR THEM WITH HIS COMPANY AT SUPPER TO WHICH SANDFORD REPLIED NO DOUBT FOR YOU WILL HARDLY ANY OF YOU SEE HIM IN THE MORNING
SHE MEANS TO BE AT THE BALL IN OPPOSITION TO HER GUARDIAN'S WILL THEN SAID MRS HORTON I'LL NOT BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DETERING HER--IF SHE DOES IT MAY BE FOR THE BEST
THE CHILD OF NATURE
AND THUS EXPOSED YOU TO MISERY MORE BITTER THAN DEATH I AM NOT WORTHY OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP MR DORRIFORTH SAID SHE SOBBING WITH GRIEF AND FROM THIS MOMENT FORSAKE ME NO MADAM NOT IN THE MOMENT YOU FIRST DISCOVER TO ME HOW I CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY THE CONVERSATION APPEARING NOW TO BECOME OF A NATURE IN WHICH THE REST OF THE COMPANY COULD HAVE NO SHARE WHATEVER THEY WERE ALL EXCEPT MR SANDFORD RETIRING
THIS MELANCHOLY INCIDENT PERHAPS AFFECTED MATILDA AND ALL THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED LADY ELMWOOD BEYOND ANY OTHER THAT HAD OCCURRED SINCE HER DEATH
BY COMPLYING WITH THIS REQUEST GIVE ME TO BELIEVE THAT SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN UNDER MY CARE YOU THINK I HAVE AT LEAST FAITHFULLY DISCHARGED SOME PART OF MY DUTY
AND HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON UNDER THE PRETENCE THAT HE COULD NOT LIVE IN THE SMOKE OF LONDON HE SET OUT FOR THE NORTH
AND WHEN IT CAME WAS SO MUCH INDISPOSED AS TO BE OBLIGED TO DEFER HER JOURNEY FOR A WEEK
THEIR MUTUAL GREETINGS WHEN THEY MET WERE UNCEREMONIOUS BUT CORDIAL
THE LADIES ALL OBSERVED HIS CARRIAGE AND SERVANTS
BUT THAT THE READER MAY BE INTERESTED IN WHAT DORRIFORTH SAYS AND DOES IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION OF HIS PERSON AND MANNERS
AND EVEN THEY WERE NOT WHOLLY PRESERVED FROM THE RAVAGES MADE BY ITS RIVAL ART WHILE HER FATHER WAS IN HEALTH HE BEHELD WITH EXTREME DELIGHT HIS ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER WITHOUT ONE FAULT WHICH TASTE OR ELEGANCE COULD HAVE IMPUTED TO HER
THE PART I UNDERTOOK TO PERFORM CRIED SHE IS OVER--I WILL NOW FOR MY WHOLE LIFE APPEAR IN MY OWN CHARACTER AND GIVE A LOOSE TO THE ANGUISH I ENDURE AS DAYLIGHT SHOWED ITSELF--"AND YET I MIGHT SEE HIM ONCE AGAIN SAID SHE--"I MIGHT SEE HIM WITHIN THESE TWO HOURS IF I PLEASED FOR MR SANDFORD INVITED ME IF YOU THINK MY DEAR MISS MILNER SAID MISS WOODLEY THAT A SECOND PARTING FROM LORD ELMWOOD WOULD BUT GIVE YOU A SECOND AGONY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN DO NOT SEE HIM ANY MORE--BUT IF YOU HOPE YOUR MIND WOULD BE EASIER WERE YOU TO BID EACH OTHER ADIEU IN A MORE DIRECT MANNER THAN YOU DID LAST NIGHT LET US GO DOWN AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM
IN WHICH TIME I HOPE TO BECOME ONCE MORE RECONCILED TO THE CHANGE OF STATE I AM ENJOINED--A CHANGE I NOW MOST FERVENTLY WISH COULD BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH
A TENANT OF LORD ELMWOOD'S WHO OCCUPIED A LITTLE FARM NEAR TO THAT WHERE LADY MATILDA LIVED AND WHO WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE HISTORY OF HER'S AND HER MOTHER'S MISFORTUNES WAS RETURNING FROM A NEIGHBOURING FAIR JUST AS THIS INHUMAN PLAN WAS PUT IN EXECUTION
AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN I WAS AFFECTED WITH A WEAKNESS WHICH AROSE FROM ACCIDENT THAT I HAVE BETRAYED INCONSISTENCY YOU THEN ASSERT AGAIN THAT YOU HAVE NO AFFECTION FOR MY LORD FREDERICK NOT ENOUGH TO BECOME HIS WIFE YOU ARE ALARMED AT MARRIAGE AND I DO NOT WONDER YOU SHOULD BE SO
WHEN BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HER MAID HE HAD PLACED HER UPON A SOFA--COVERED WITH SHAME AND CONFUSION FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES BEFORE HER AND EARNESTLY ENTREATED HER FORGIVENESS FOR THE INDELICACY HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN HER PRESENCE AND THAT HE HAD ALARMED HER AND HAD FORGOT THE RESPECT WHICH HE THOUGHT SACREDLY HER DUE SEEMED THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH THEN DWELT UPON HIS THOUGHTS
AND HE WAS EAGER SHE SHOULD SEE THAT HE ENTIRELY FORGAVE HER
AND LOOKING STEDFASTLY AT HIM HE SAID IN THAT STERN MANNER WHICH HE NOW ALMOST INVARIABLY ADOPTED YOU HAVE NO ENGAGEMENTS I SUPPOSE
SHE BADE MRS HORTON IMMEDIATELY GOOD NIGHT
UNGRATEFUL MAN
AND WHATEVER VOWS LORD ELMWOOD HAD POSSIBLY MADE TO ANOTHER SHE JUSTLY SUPPOSED THAT NO WOMAN'S LOVE FOR HIM EQUALLED MISS MILNER'S--IT WAS PRIOR TO ALL OTHERS TOO
MISS MILNER CRIED FOR ANGER
THE OCCASION OF MY REMAINING HERE A WEEK LONGER IS TO SETTLE SOME NECESSARY AFFAIRS AMONG WHICH THE PRINCIPAL IS THAT OF DELIVERING TO A FRIEND A MAN OF WORTH AND OF TENDERNESS ALL THOSE WRITINGS WHICH HAVE INVESTED ME WITH THE POWER OF MY GUARDIANSHIP--HE WILL THE DAY AFTER MY DEPARTURE WITHOUT ONE UPBRAIDING WORD RESIGN THEM TO YOU IN MY NAME
ANOTHER GENTLEMAN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE MADE OVERTURES TO MISS MILNER
WOULD YOU HAVE GONE MY LORD ASKED MISS MILNER HIGHLY DELIGHTED
BUT GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENQUIRE TO WHAT LUCKY ACCIDENT WE MAY ATTRIBUTE THIS ALTERATION YOUR LORDSHIP THEN THINKS ALL MY COMMENDABLE DEEDS ARISE FROM ACCIDENT AND THAT I HAVE NO VIRTUES OF MY OWN PARDON ME I THINK YOU HAVE MANY THIS HE SPOKE EMPHATICALLY
NAY PERHAPS WITH GREATER FORCE SHOULD HE SUSPECT HIS WEAKNESS AS HE CALLS IT ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO THEM IF HE DOES BUT THINK OF ME WITH TENDERNESS CRIED MATILDA I AM RECOMPENSED AND WHAT RECOMPENSE WOULD HIS KIND THOUGHTS BE TO YOU SAID SANDFORD WERE HE TO TURN YOU OUT TO BEGGARY A GREAT DEAL--A GREAT DEAL SHE REPLIED
AND THOUGH HIS AFFECTION HAD SPRUNG FROM THE MOST LAUDABLE MOTIVES YET WAS HE ASHAMED OF IT AS OF A VICE--HE ROSE HE WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM AND HE DID NOT LOOK SANDFORD IN THE FACE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BY MY OWN DESIGN NEVER WILL I SEE HIM AGAIN AND HER TEARS BURST FORTH AS IF HER HEART BURST AT THE SAME TIME
AND NEAR TO THAT HOUR WHEN SHE CAME FIRST TO THE HOUSE
BUT ALTHOUGH MISS WOODLEY WAS THIRTY-FIVE AND IN PERSON EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN YET SHE POSSESSED SUCH AN EXTREME CHEERFULNESS OF TEMPER AND SUCH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FUND OF GOOD NATURE THAT SHE ESCAPED NOT ONLY THE RIDICULE BUT EVEN THE APPELLATION OF AN OLD MAID
INCHBALD WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY G
AS HE HAD AT FIRST AN ESTEEM FOR HER ON THE FOUNDATION OF HIS LOVE FOR LORD AND LADY ELMWOOD
AND HE FELT HE COULD NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM
CHEERFUL CONTENT AND SOMETIMES RATHER HAPPY
HER FRIEND LOVED HER TOO SINCERELY TO BE PREVAILED UPON
THOUGH SANDFORD'S FREQUENT VISITS SOOTHED MATILDA THEY COULD NOT COMFORT HER
DAYLIGHT JUST PEEPED THROUGH THE SHUTTERS OF THE ROOM IN WHICH LORD ELMWOOD AND SANDFORD WERE SITTING WHEN THE SOUND OF HER CARRIAGE AND THE SUDDEN STOP IT MADE AT THE DOOR CAUSED LORD ELMWOOD TO START FROM HIS CHAIR
I AM SORRY TO SEE YOU SO UNEASY MISS MILNER SAID MISS FENTON WITH PERFECT UNCONCERN
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE MY DEAR MISS MILNER HE GENTLY WHISPERED TO SAY WHAT JOY I FEEL THAT YOUR DISORDER HAS SUBSIDED BUT THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IT WAS POSSIBLE TO LOOK WHAT HE FELT AND HIS LOOKS EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS
PRIDE WAS THE FIRST EMOTION HIS PRESENCE INSPIRED--PRIDE WHICH AROSE FROM THE HUMILITY INTO WHICH SHE WAS PLUNGED
MISS WOODLEY'S REPLY WAS A SUMMONS FOR HER TO TOWN UPON SOME PRETENDED BUSINESS WHICH SHE AVOIDED EXPLAINING BUT WHICH ENTIRELY SILENCED LADY LUNEHAM'S ENTREATIES FOR HER STAY
LOST IN THE MAZE OF HAPPINESS THAT SURROUNDED HER MISS MILNER OFTENTIMES ASKED HER HEART AND HER HEART WHISPERED LIKE A FLATTERER YES ARE NOT MY CHARMS EVEN MORE INVINCIBLE THAN I EVER BELIEVED THEM TO BE
THE STORY OF LADY ELMWOOD WAS KNOWN TO LORD MARGRAVE AND AS HE BEHELD HER DAUGHTER WITH A PASSION SUCH AS HE HAD BEEN UNUSED TO OVERCOME HE INDULGED IT WITH THE PROBABLE HOPE THAT ON THE DEATH OF THE MOTHER LORD ELMWOOD WOULD RECEIVE HIS CHILD AND PERHAPS ACCEPT HIM AS HIS SON-IN-LAW
AND SHE RIGOROUSLY ENJOINED HERSELF NOT TO SHRINK FROM THE LITTLE WHICH REMAINED
THE MOST TRIUMPHANT OF THESE PASSAGES IS THE SCENE ON THE STAIRCASE OF ELMWOOD HOUSE--A PASSAGE WHICH WOULD BE SPOILT BY QUOTATION AND WHICH NO ONE WHO HAS EVER READ IT COULD FORGET
I WILL WHILE SHE AVOIDS MY SIGHT OR THE GIVING ME ANY REMEMBRANCE OF HER
HE PAID VISITS HIMSELF FOR SEVERAL DAYS
BUT WERE GONE TO A FARM HOUSE NOT FARTHER THAN THIRTY MILES FROM LORD ELMWOOD'S
THE IDEA OF LOVE NEVER ONCE CAME TO HER THOUGHTS
MY LORD I HAVE BOUGHT YOU A PRESENT SAID SHE
NO--FOR NOT KNOWING ITS CONTENTS I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT MYSELF TOWARDS HIM HERE A SILENCE FOLLOWED
AND HER WORK WAS IMMEDIATELY AND IMMENSELY POPULAR
BUT HIS INTERROGATOR HAD MADE THE TWO ANSWERS INSEPARABLE SO THAT ALL EVASIONS OF THE SECOND RUSHBROOK KNEW WOULD BE FRUITLESS AFTER HAVING AVOWED THE FIRST--AND HOW COULD HE CONFESS THE LATTER
HE WAS READING
THE DISCOURSE AT LENGTH DREW FROM MR DORRIFORTH THIS OBSERVATION
SHE STEPPED SECRETLY INTO THE NORWICH COACH AND WENT TO LONDON
HE COULD NEVER PROCURE EVEN A SIGHT OF HIM
OR LOOK AT HIM BUT WHEN HE COULD NOT HELP IT
BUT HER APPREHENSIONS WERE GROUNDLESS
DORRIFORTH BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE HAD NOT ONLY MADE A SACRIFICE OF HER AFFECTIONS BUT OF HER VERACITY
IS IT TRUE THAT LADY ELMWOOD IS DEAD IT IS MY LORD HIS LORDSHIP LOOKED UNUSUALLY GRAVE AND AT THIS REPLY FETCHED AN INVOLUNTARY SIGH
WILL YOU IN POSSESSING ALL MY AFFECTIONS BEAR WITH ALL MY INFIRMITIES SHE RAISED HIM FROM HER FEET AND BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE BY THE TEARS THAT BATHED HIS HANDS GAVE HIM CONFIDENCE
WHEN THEIR SCHEME WAS MATURE FOR PERFORMANCE THREE OF HIS CHOSEN COMPANIONS AND THREE SERVANTS TRAINED IN ALL THE VILLAINOUS EXPLOITS OF THEIR MASTERS SET OFF FOR THE HABITATION OF POOR MATILDA AND ARRIVED THERE ABOUT THE TWILIGHT OF THE EVENING
THE VERY NEXT DAY A GLOOM OVERSPREAD THEIR BRIGHT PROSPECTS ON MR SANDFORD'S SAYING AS HE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST-ROOM MISS FENTON LADIES DESIRED ME TO PRESENT HER COMPLIMENTS IS SHE IN TOWN ASKED MRS HORTON
SHE WROTE HER MEMOIRS AND SHE BURNT THEM
BUT THIS INJUNCTION WHICH ALL HIS FRIENDS AND EVEN THE SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE WHO ATTENDED HIS PERSON HAD RECEIVED WAS BY MANY PEOPLE SUSPECTED RATHER TO PROCEED FROM HIS RESENTMENT THAN HIS TENDERNESS
AFTER QUITTING LEICESTER SQUARE PROBABLY FOR EVER--AFTER CARING SCARCE AT ALL OR THINKING OF DR GISBORNE
ON HIS RETURN HOME CHEERED WITH THE HUZZAS OF HIS JOVIAL COMPANIONS HE BEGAN TO CONSULT THOSE FRIENDS WHAT SCHEME WAS BEST TO BE ADOPTED FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS DESIRES
THAT LORD ELMWOOD COULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE REAL PETITION WAS WHICH RUSHBROOK MEANT TO PRESENT HIM IS CERTAIN
AS HE REFLECTED ON THIS TO SANDFORD HE FELT THE FIRST TIE OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT--BUT FOR HIS COMPASSION HE KNEW HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT VERY TIME OF THEIR MEETING AT DINNER AWAY FROM ELMWOOD HOUSE FOR EVER
PRINTED FOR G
PRINTED FOR G
PRINTED FOR G
PRINTED FOR G
ON CONSIDERATION I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO SEE MISS WOODLEY AT ANY TIME--I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE HER--DO NOT LET HER BE FRIGHTENED AT ME--TO HER I SHALL BE THE SAME THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SHE IS A GOOD WOMAN MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD PLEASED
BUT SHE WHO AS HIS WARD HAD BEEN EVER GENTLE AND WHEN HE STRENUOUSLY OPPOSED ALWAYS OBEDIENT
SHE ONCE INSINUATED TO HIM TO BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THEM
GO TO HIM IN THE LIBRARY AND HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
GOOD HEAVEN EXCLAIMED HE HOW AM I TO ACCOMPLISH HER WISHES
SHE HAD WRITTEN SOME FARCES AND IN 1784 ONE OF THEM A MOGUL TALE WAS ACCEPTED ACTED AND OBTAINED A GREAT SUCCESS
LORD FREDERICK WHO HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIS INTENDED UNION WITH HIS WARD FOR IT WAS EVEN KEPT A SECRET AT PRESENT FROM EVERY SERVANT IN THE HOUSE IMPUTED THIS DISCOMPOSURE TO THE PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE MIGHT BEAR HIM IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DUEL
OR IF NOT WHILE LORD ELMWOOD BEHELD THE OFFENCE WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT INDIFFERENCE GAVE IT A SANCTION THEY MIGHT IN VAIN OPPOSE
SANDFORD ON HIS PART BEHAVED JUST THE SAME AS EVER
1806
AND IF MY LORD I HAVE PROVED ANY MERIT IN A LATE FORBEARANCE REWARD ME FOR IT NOW
SHE HALTED AS IF SHE FEARED TO APPROACH--HE HESITATED AS IF HE KNEW NOT HOW TO SPEAK
AND MR MILNER MATILDA'S GRANDFATHER HAD BETTER HAVE GIVEN HIS FORTUNE TO A DISTANT BRANCH OF HIS FAMILY--AS MATILDA'S FATHER ONCE MEANT TO DO--SO THAT HE HAD GIVEN TO HIS DAUGHTER A PROPER EDUCATION
ELMWOOD HOUSE OR RATHER CASTLE THE SEAT OF LORD ELMWOOD WAS ONLY A FEW MILES DISTANT FROM THIS RESIDENCE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO PASS GREAT PART OF THE SUMMER THERE WITH HIS TUTOR MR SANDFORD
MATILDA WAS CARRIED TO HER OWN APARTMENTS LAID UPON THE BED AND MISS WOODLEY HASTED TO ATTEND HER AFTER LISTENING TO THE RECITAL OF WHAT HAD PASSED
SHE HOWEVER DECLARED SHE HAD LONG PROGNOSTICATED IT WOULD COME TO THIS AND SHE ONLY THANKED HEAVEN IT WAS NO WORSE WHAT COULD BE WORSE MADAM CRIED MISS MILNER
AT HALF AFTER ELEVEN MISS MILNER'S CHAIR AND ANOTHER WITH MISS WOODLEY TOOK THEM FROM LORD ELMWOOD'S TO CALL UPON THE PARTY WOOD-NYMPHS AND HUNTRESSES WHO WERE TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND MAKE UP THE SUIT OF DIANA
I SAW AND KNEW HIM LORD ELMWOOD LISTENED TO THE LAST PART OF THIS ACCOUNT WITH SEEMING COMPOSURE--THEN TURNING HASTILY TO RUSHBROOK HE SAID WHERE ARE MY PISTOLS HARRY SANDFORD ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND FORGETTING ALL THE ANGER BETWEEN THEM CAUGHT HOLD OF THE EARL'S HAND AND CRIED WILL YOU THEN PROVE YOURSELF A FATHER LORD ELMWOOD ONLY ANSWERED YES AND LEFT THE ROOM
NATURE AND ART THE SECOND EDITION IN TWO VOLUMES PRICE 7S
VOL
VOL
VOL
VOL
AT FIRST HIS FURY THREATENED A RETORT UPON THE SERVANTS AROUND HIM AND WHO REFUSED HIS ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE PUNISHMENT HE HAD RECEIVED
FOR I HAVE CONDESCENDED TO TALK TO HIM IN THE MOST FAMILIAR TERMS TO CONDESCEND MY LORD IS NOT TO BE FAMILIAR THEN COME SIR LET US BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING THROUGH YOU
INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING LORD ELMWOOD AS USUAL SANDFORD POURED OUT A GLASS OF WINE AND DRANK IT
WHY ON MY OBSERVING THAT I THOUGHT MR RUSHBROOK LOOKED PALER THAN USUAL AND APPEARED NOT TO BE IN PERFECT HEALTH WHICH WAS REALLY THE CASE YOUR FATHER EXPRESSED THE GREATEST ANXIETY IMAGINABLE
THEN DON'T MENTION THEM ANY MORE LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT SAID DORRIFORTH
THIS WAS NOT THE WAY TO SECURE THE AFFECTIONS OF LORD ELMWOOD
WHEN THE TIME FOR MISS WOODLEY'S DEPARTURE ARRIVED MISS MILNER ENTREATED EARNESTLY TO ACCOMPANY HER HOME AND MADE THE MOST SOLEMN PROMISES THAT SHE WOULD GUARD NOT ONLY HER BEHAVIOUR BUT HER VERY THOUGHTS WITHIN THE LIMITATION HER FRIEND SHOULD PRESCRIBE
BECAUSE REPLIED SANDFORD I WENT INTO YOUR BED-CHAMBER JUST NOW AND I FOUND YOUR BED MADE
BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT SUCH A STEP WOULD BE MORE PERILOUS TO HER THAN TO ANY OTHER PERSON AS SHE WAS THE MOST DESTITUTE BEING ON EARTH WITHOUT THE BENEVOLENCE OF LORD ELMWOOD
BUT THE THOUGHT OF MATILDA'S FATE--THE IDEA OF AWAKENING IN HIS MIND A SENTIMENT THAT MIGHT IRRITATE HIM AGAINST HIS CHILD WROUGHT MORE FORCIBLY THAN EVERY OTHER EFFORT
AND THAT THE TENDERNESS HE FELT TOWARDS HER AND THE ANXIETY FOR HER HAPPINESS BEFORE HE KNEW HER EXTREME AS THEY WERE WERE YET COOL AND DISPASSIONATE SENSATIONS COMPARED TO THOSE WHICH HER PERSON AND DEMEANOUR HAD INCITED--AND THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BY THE PRECEDING SENTIMENTS HIS HEART WAS SOFTENED PREPARED AND MOULDED AS IT WERE TO RECEIVE THIS LAST IMPRESSION YET THE VIOLENCE OF HIS PASSION TOLD HIM THAT GENUINE LOVE IF NOT THE BASIS ON WHICH IT WAS FOUNDED HAD BEEN THE CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE
NOTHING SAID MRS HORTON I KNOW NOTHING AND SHE LIFTED UP HER HANDS AND SHOOK HER HEAD
MORE LIKELY SIX CRIED SANDFORD
A MAN OF HONESTY AND SOBRIETY AND WITH AN INDIGENT FAMILY OF AGED PARENTS CHILDREN AND OTHER RELATIONS WHO SUBSISTED WHOLLY ON THE INCOME ARISING FROM HIS PLACE
MISS WOODLEY TOO HAD CAUSE TO BE WELL PLEASED
AT LEAST NOT SUSPECTING ANY CAUSE FOR THEIR ABATEMENT RUSHBROOK DID NOT OBSERVE ANY ALTERATION
LORD ELMWOOD HAD ALWAYS BEEN ATTENTIVE TO HER
SO ALL PEOPLE SAY WHO KNOW A GREAT DEAL CRIED SANDFORD AND I SUSPECT THAT IS AT PRESENT YOUR CASE THEN I KNOW MORE THAN I WISH I AM SURE MR SANDFORD RETURNED SHE SHRUGGING UP HER SHOULDERS
COMPARED WITH A SIMPLE STORY EVEN THE NARROW CANVASES OF JANE AUSTEN SEEM SPACIOUS PICTURES OF DIVERSIFIED LIFE
OH LET THIS BE MY ATONEMENT SHE CRIED WITH THE MOST EARNEST SUPPLICATION
I TOO AM WILLING TO PARDON ANY LITTLE DISSIMULATION THAT IS BUT CONSISTENT WITH A MODESTY THAT BECOMES EVERY WOMAN UPON THE SUBJECT OF MARRIAGE
AND IF I SHOULD FAIL CONTINUED HE YET WHILE I LIVE SHE SHALL NOT WANT A FRIEND OR PROTECTOR--ALL AN OLD MAN LIKE ME CAN ANSWER FOR"----HERE HIS TEARS INTERRUPTED HIM
FOR THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE HAD HURT HER SPIRITS TOO MUCH TO SUFFER HER TO LISTEN WITH PLEASURE TO ANYTHING
MISS MILNER TAKING HER BY THE HAND SAID I KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL--I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF ME--AND HOW MUCH YOU HATE AND DESPISE ME
FOR TO HAVE BELIEVED HERSELF THOUGHT OF WITH TENDERNESS BY HER FATHER WOULD HAVE ALONE CONSTITUTED HER HAPPINESS
DO YOU WISH TO SEE HER THOUGH IT WAS THE FIRST WISH OF HIS HEART HE PAUSED AND SAID WILL YOU PLEAD MY EXCUSE AS THE FLIGHT OF STAIRS WAS BUT SHORT WHICH MATILDA HAD TO COME DOWN SHE WAS IN THE ROOM WITH MISS WOODLEY AND MR RUSHBROOK JUST AS THAT SENTENCE ENDED
SHE NOTWITHSTANDING MADE HIM A VERY LOW COURTESY
BUT HAD THE GENIUS OF SANDFORD PRESIDED OVER THIS DISCOVERY IT COULD NOT HAVE INFLUENCED THE MIND OF MISS MILNER TO RECEIVE THE INTELLIGENCE WITH A TEMPER MORE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT WHICH IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE INFORMER TO RECOMMEND
THIS FEMALE AT LENGTH THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO WAIT UPON HER WORTHY EMPLOYER AND INFORM HIM THE YOUNG LADY IN HER TRUST WOULD CERTAINLY DIE UNLESS THERE WERE MEANS EMPLOYED TO OBLIGE HER TO TAKE SOME NOURISHMENT
AND DORRIFORTH'S REPLY GAVE HIM ENTIRE SATISFACTION
SHE DETERMINED TO RESENT HIS TREATMENT
SHE HAD SEVERAL INTERVIEWS WITH HIM ALONE AND THE STORY GOES THAT IN THE LAST SHE SNATCHED UP A BASIN OF HOT WATER AND DASHED IT IN HIS FACE
A PLAY IN FIVE ACTS FROM THE GERMAN OF KOTZEBUE
SHE SAW HER FRIEND WAS PROVIDING HERSELF WITH A WEIGHT OF CARES THAT SHE WOULD SOON FIND INFINITELY TOO MUCH FOR HER STRENGTH TO BEAR--SHE WOULD HAVE REASONED WITH HER BUT ALL HER ARGUMENTS HAD LONG SINCE PROVED UNAVAILING
BUT ON THE EVE OF BEING AT LIBERTY AND ON THE EVE OF MAKING HIS CHOICE SHE WAS OFFENDED THAT CHOICE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY FIXED UPON HER
I CAN'T WAIT WITH PATIENCE TILL THAT TIME ANSWERED LORD ELMWOOD WITH A MOST ANXIOUS SIGH
THOSE INVOLUNTARY SIGHS HOWEVER THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD LONG AGO OBSERVED BECAME STILL MORE FREQUENT
SHE TREMBLED--SHE WAS WHITE AS ASHES AND DEPRIVED OF SPEECH
AND TO PROVE TO HIS WARD THAT HE IS SO MUCH OFFENDED AS NO LONGER TO FEEL THAT EXCESSIVE INTEREST IN HER CONCERNS WHICH HE ONCE FELT HE GIVES AN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WITH INDIFFERENCE--HE DESIRES MISS MILNER WILL DO WHAT SHE HERSELF THINKS PROPER MISS WOODLEY INSTANTLY ACCEPTS THIS PERMISSION WRITES BACK AND APPOINTS THE DAY UPON WHICH HER FRIEND MEANS TO SET OFF FOR THE VISIT
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
SANDFORD TOOK NO NOTICE OF EITHER BUT HAD A BOOK WHICH WAS HIS CUSTOM WHEN HE DINED WITH PERSONS WHOSE CONVERSATION WAS NOT INTERESTING TO HIM LAID BY THE SIDE OF HIS PLATE WHICH HE OCCASIONALLY LOOKED INTO AS THE DISHES WERE REMOVING OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SERVED
AFTER THIS LONG PAUSE THE EARL SAID WITH COMPOSURE BUT WITH FIRMNESS HAVE YOU FINISHED MR RUSHBROOK ALL THAT I DARE TO UTTER MY LORD
1 THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT IS BASED UPON THE MEMOIRS OF MRS INCHBALD INCLUDING HER FAMILIAR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED PERSONS OF HER TIME EDITED BY JAMES BOADEN ESQ.--A DISCURSIVE VAGUE AND NOT UNAMUSING BOOK
YET AS SHE SUFFERED TOO FOR MR SANDFORD THE JOY OF HER FRIEND'S REPLY WAS ABATED BY THE UNEASINESS IT GAVE TO HIM BUT MRS HORTON FELT FOR NONE BUT THE RIGHT REVEREND PRIEST
HE HAD HEARD WITH SURPRISE AND STILL GREATER JOY THAT LORD ELMWOOD HAD ONCE MORE SHUT HIS DOORS AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER
WHERE MY LADY DID NOT TELL ME AND DON'T YOU KNOW NO MY LORD SHE ANSWERED AND WITHOUT BLUSHING
IV
YES--I DO REMEMBER SOMETHING OF IT
NOR WHEN THE CONVERSATION BEGAN WAS THE NAME OF DORRIFORTH ONCE UTTERED--THEY WERE GROWN COOL AND CONSIDERATE SINCE THE DISCOVERY AND BOTH WERE EQUALLY FEARFUL OF NAMING HIM
SHE FELT THE SYMPTOMS OF FAINTING AND EAGERLY SNATCHED A GLASS OF WATER WHICH THE SERVANT WAS HOLDING TO SANDFORD WHO HAD CALLED FOR IT AND DRANK IT OFF;--AS SHE RETURNED THE GLASS TO THE SERVANT SHE BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE TO MR SANDFORD FOR HER SEEMING RUDENESS BUT BEFORE SHE COULD UTTER WHAT SHE INTENDED HE SAID GOOD-NATUREDLY NEVER MIND--YOU ARE VERY WELCOME--I AM GLAD YOU TOOK IT SHE LOOKED AT HIM TO OBSERVE WHETHER HE HAD REALLY SPOKEN KINDLY OR IRONICALLY
FOR IT WAS NO OTHER THAN HE WHOSE PASSION FOR LADY ELMWOOD HAD STILL SUBSISTED AND WHOSE ADDRESS IN GALLANTRY LEFT NO MEANS UNATTEMPTED FOR THE SUCCESS OF HIS DESIGNS;--NO OTHER THAN HE WHO NEXT TO LORD ELMWOOD HAD BEEN OF ALL HER LOVERS THE MOST FAVOURED TO WHOM LADY ELMWOOD SACRIFICED HER OWN AND HER HUSBAND'S FUTURE PEACE AND THUS GAVE TO HIS VANITY A PROUDER TRIUMPH THAN IF SHE HAD NEVER BESTOWED HER HAND IN MARRIAGE ON ANOTHER
MY LORD REPLIED MRS HORTON I SINCERELY WISH YOU HEALTH AND HAPPINESS LIKEWISE HE THEN WENT TO MISS WOODLEY AND TAKING HER HAND REPEATED MUCH THE SAME AS HE HAD SAID TO MRS HORTON
AND AFTER A FEW POWERFUL STRUGGLES SHE OBEYED
THE EARL OF ELMWOOD WAS AT THAT JUNCTURE ANNOUNCED--A CATHOLIC NOBLEMAN JUST COME OF AGE AND ON THE EVE OF MARRIAGE
OR IF THERE WAS I AM PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD NOT RESENT IT
BUT SIR IF YOU KNOW MY RESENTFUL AND RELENTLESS TEMPER YOU SURELY KNOW HOW TO SHUN IT NOT AND SPEAK PLAINLY THEN DISSEMBLE NO I'LL NOT DO THAT--BUT I'LL BE SILENT A NEW PARADE OF SUBMISSION
RUSHBROOK IMMEDIATELY FELL UPON HIS KNEES--"OH
BUT HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY RECALL HER RECOLLECTION BY A RESERVE TOO AWFUL AND A GENTLENESS TOO SACRED FOR HER TO VIOLATE
I UNDERSTAND YOU--UPON EVERY OTHER SUBJECT BUT THE ONLY ONE MY CONTENT REQUIRES YOU ARE READY TO OBEY ME
RUSHBROOK WAS DETAINED AT ELMWOOD HOUSE DURING ALL THIS TIME MORE FROM THE PERSUASIONS NAY PRAYERS OF SANDFORD THAN THE COMMANDS OF LORD ELMWOOD
AND HE WAS HIMSELF A ROMAN CATHOLIC SO THAT HE MUST BE WELL INFORMED ON THE SUBJECT UPON WHICH HE SPOKE
AND AS SOON AS MISS MILNER AND SHE WERE ALONE REPEATED ALL HE HAD REVEALED TO HER
RUSHBROOK HAD BEEN A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND WAS NOW AN EXTREMELY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
NOW I WILL NO LONGER CONTINUED HE HAVE AN ENEMY SUCH AS YOU HAVE BEEN TO HEIGHTEN HER CHARMS WHICH ARE TOO TRANSCENDENT IN THEIR NATIVE STATE
FOR I HAD RATHER HE SHOULD ADMIRE ME THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES AND YET HE IS NOT TO SEE ME IN IT BUT HE WOULD NOT ADMIRE YOU SO DRESSED SAID MISS WOODLEY
SHE HAD INDEED INVOLUNTARY WEAKNESSES BUT NONE WITH WHICH SHE DID NOT STRUGGLE AND IN GENERAL HER STRUGGLES WERE VICTORIOUS
AND IN RECITING EVERY PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE MADE HER CONSIDER THE VOLUMES ALMOST LIKE PRESENTS FROM HER FATHER
YOU GO AWAY WITH YOUR HEART SATISFIED NAY EVEN ELATED IN THE PROSPECT THAT MISS MILNER'S HOPES ON WHICH SHE ALONE EXISTS THOSE HOPES WHICH KEEP HER FROM THE DEEPEST AFFLICTION AND CHERISH HER WITH JOY AND GLADNESS WILL ALL BE DISAPPOINTED
THIS TAUNTING REPROOF FROM SANDFORD MADE LITTLE IMPRESSION UPON MISS MILNER WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALL FIXED ON A SUBJECT OF MUCH MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE OPINION WHICH HE ENTERTAINED OF HER
SIR EDWARD IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ENQUIRED WHAT NEIGHBOURS WERE IN THE COUNTRY AND SHE WITH AN APPEARANCE OF HIGH SATISFACTION NAMED LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY AS BEING HOURLY EXPECTED AT HIS UNCLE'S
AS SOON THEREFORE AS THE SERVANTS WERE ALL WITHDRAWN HE BEGAN
MEANING AT THE SAME TIME TO MENTION MATILDA AS AN OPPONENT FROM WHOM HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
WHERE HE INDEED SOBBED LIKE A BOY
TO HER
AND OF ALL HIS PROVOCATIONS--HER KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WORD LONG SINCE GIVEN TO SANDFORD THAT IF ONCE RESOLVED HE WOULD NOT RECALL HIS RESOLUTION"--THE CERTAINTY OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARRANGED FOR HIS TRAVELS ALL CONVINCED HER THAT BY ANY INTERFERENCE SHE WOULD ONLY EXPOSE MISS MILNER'S LOVE AND DELICACY TO A CONTEMPTUOUS REJECTION
THEN I PITY HIM AND I BELIEVE SAID MISS WOODLEY THAT FROM HIS HEART HE COMPASSIONATES YOU
HER MISS MILNER IS AN ORIGINAL AND BRILLIANT CREATION COMPACT OF CHARM AND LIFE
LADY MATILDA CRIED HE IF YOU KNEW THE SENSATIONS OF MY HEART YOU WOULD NOT TREAT ME WITH THIS DISDAIN WE CAN ONLY JUDGE OF THOSE SENSATIONS MR RUSHBROOK SAID MISS WOODLEY BY THE EFFECT THEY HAVE UPON YOUR CONDUCT
LORD ELMWOOD WAS HURT BEYOND MEASURE
AND A SEVERE WORD OF HIS INSTEAD OF EXASPERATING WAS SURE TO SUBDUE HER
INCHBALD
INCHBALD
INCHBALD
INCHBALD
LORD ELMWOOD WAS THE FIRST WHO ROSE FROM BREAKFAST AND HE DID NOT RETURN TO DINNER
HE WAS NOT MORE THAN TWENTY-THREE
ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD CALLED TO THEM--AND INTO GIFFARD'S HANDS DELIVERED HIS APPARENTLY DEAD CHILD
WHEN SANDFORD ACTED DELIBERATELY HE ALWAYS ACTED UP TO HIS DUTY
IN A LARGE GLOOMY APARTMENT OF THIS SOLITARY HABITATION THE WINDOWS OF WHICH SCARCE RENDERED THE LIGHT ACCESSIBLE WAS LAID UPON HER DEATH-BED THE ONCE LOVELY LADY ELMWOOD--PALE HALF SUFFOCATED WITH THE LOSS OF BREATH
AND GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECALLING IT--BUT AFTER THIS MOMENT IT IS A LIE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN--A LIE TO YOUR FRIEND AND FATHER AND I WILL NOT FORGIVE IT RUSHBROOK STOOD SILENT CONFUSED ALARMED AND BEWILDERED IN HIS THOUGHTS
WHO WAS TO SWEAR TO THE ROBBER
AND THEN AS IF IN COMPLIMENT TO HER HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT;--WITH AN AIR OF RIDICULE HE CRIED I WISH MR DORRIFORTH YOU WOULD GIVE ME ABSOLUTION OF ALL MY SINS FOR I CONFESS THEY ARE MANY AND MANIFOLD HOLD MY LORD EXCLAIMED DORRIFORTH DO NOT CONFESS BEFORE THE LADIES LEST IN ORDER TO EXCITE THEIR COMPASSION YOU SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO ACCUSE YOURSELF OF SINS YOU HAVE NEVER YET COMMITTED AT THIS MISS MILNER LAUGHED SEEMINGLY SO WELL PLEASED THAT LORD FREDERICK WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER REPEATED FROM ABELARD IT CAME AND ELOISA STILL MUST LOVE THE NAME WHETHER FROM AN INATTENTION TO THE QUOTATION OR FROM A CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS WHOLLY INAPPLICABLE DORRIFORTH HEARD IT WITHOUT ONE EMOTION OF SHAME OR OF ANGER--WHILE MISS MILNER SEEMED SHOCKED AT THE IMPLICATION
THE MARRIED MAN A COMEDY PRICE 1S
THE EARL CAME IN EXTREMELY GOOD HEALTH AND SPIRITS BUT APPEARED CONCERNED TO FIND RUSHBROOK LESS WELL THAN WHEN HE WENT FROM TOWN
BUT MR SANDFORD CAN WITNESS THEIR SINCERITY AND HOW LONG THEY HAVE BEEN FIXED FIXED CRIED THE EARL
COME IN AN ELDERLY MAN ENTERED WHO HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS THE HEAD GARDENER AT ELMWOOD HOUSE
SHE EVEN AND IN REALITY DID NOT THINK HIM HANDSOME OR ENGAGING IN HIS MANNERS--SHE THOUGHT HIS GAIETY FRIVOLOUSNESS HIS COMPLAISANCE AFFECTATION AND HIS GOOD HUMOUR IMPERTINENCE
AND OF VIRTUES ACQUIRED TO MAKE OLD AGE SUPPORTABLE THAT FORCIBLE POWER OF GENUINE FEELING WHICH DIRECTS THE TONGUE TO ELOQUENCE HAD ITS EFFECT WHILE SHE LISTENED TO HIM AND SHE SOMETIMES PUT ON THE LOOKS AND GESTURE OF ASSENT--SOMETIMES EVEN SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF CONVICTION
BUT I MAY BE MISTAKEN REPLIED MISS WOODLEY
NAY HE MIGHT PERHAPS EVEN INJURE HER WHOM HE WISHED TO SERVE
YET SHE DID NOT WEEP OR EVEN SIGH
AND ENTERING THE LISTS AS HIS DECLARED ENEMY GIVE TO THE WORLD A REASON WHY HE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER SOVEREIGNTY AS WELL AS THE REST OF HER DEVOTED SUBJECTS
HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE TESTIMONY TO SANDFORD'S OPINION THAT HE WAS BOUND BY TIES MORE SACRED THAN WORLDLY HONOUR BUT WHILE HE OWNED HE WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE DUTY
I COMMEND YOUR PRUDENCE
STRACHEY LONDON HENRY FROWDE 1908 OXFORD
WHAT CRIED MATILDA FRIGHTENED BY THE PREFACE
IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT MR SANDFORD ESTEEMED HER LESS AND LESS EVERY DAY
IN THE WIDE PROSPECT OF SADNESS BEFORE HER MISS MILNER'S FANCY CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ONLY COMFORT WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF
NOR UNDER THIS DESTINY CAN HE HAVE ANY CLAIM TO PITY
I COULD LOVE HIM IF HE HAD A THOUSAND FAULTS
EVEN SANDFORD AND MISS WOODLEY BEGAN TO RECOLLECT QUALIFICATIONS HE POSSESSED WHICH THEY NEVER HAD REFLECTED ON BEFORE AND MISS WOODLEY IN PARTICULAR REPROACHED HERSELF THAT SHE HAD BEEN SO SEVERE AND INATTENTIVE TO HIM
AND ALL YOUR COMMANDS IN THAT RESPECT HAVE BEEN OBEYED HE REPLIED I AM SATISFIED AND TO THE GRIEF OF THE OLD MAN APPEARED REALLY SO
SHE KNEW TOO HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN HER MOTHER'S FRIEND
AS THE BADNESS OF THE WEATHER HAD PREVENTED THEIR USUAL MORNING'S EXERCISE THE LADIES WERE EMPLOYED AT THEIR NEEDLES TILL THE DINNER BELL CALLED THEM AWAY
THE YOUNG EARL ACCUSTOMED IN HIS INFANCY TO FEAR HIM AS HIS MASTER IN HIS YOUTHFUL MANHOOD RECEIVED EVERY NEW INDULGENCE WITH GRATITUDE AND AT LENGTH LOVED HIM AS A FATHER--NOR HAD DORRIFORTH AS YET SHAKEN OFF SIMILAR SENSATIONS
TO EVERY VICE AS WELL AS TO EVERY VIRTUE OF MISS MILNER
FOR LADY MATILDA IS RESOLVED NEVER TO LISTEN TO YOUR PASSION THAT MAN HE REPLIED IS TO BLAME WHO CAN RELINQUISH HIS HOPES UPON THE MERE RESOLUTION OF A LADY AND THAT LADY WOULD BE WRONG REPLIED MISS WOODLEY WHO SHOULD ENTRUST HER HAPPINESS IN THE CARE OF A MAN WHO CAN THINK THUS MEANLY OF HER AND OF HER SEX I THINK HIGHLY OF THEM ALL HE REPLIED
ONE MORNING HE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY BEFORE HER AND MISS WOODLEY TO INTRODUCE AND PRESS THE SUBJECT OF SIR EDWARD ASHTON'S HOPES
SHE IMAGINED ALAS THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WISHED TO ASK HOW MISS MILNER DID BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF THE INDULGENCE
SHE SMILED WITH RIDICULE AT THE CAUTION BUT FINDING IT REPEATED AND IN A MANNER THAT INDICATED AUTHORITY SHE PROMISED NOT ONLY TO MAKE BUT TO ENFORCE THE REQUEST
ON ENTERING THE ROOM THROUGH ALL THE DEAD WHITE OF HER PRESENT COMPLECTION SHE BLUSHED TO A CRIMSON
BUT THE FAMILY CONTINUED AT THE FARM THE ELDER DAUGHTERS MARRYING AND SETTLING IN LONDON WHILE ELIZABETH GREW UP INTO A BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING GIRL
I NO LONGER CONDEMN BUT CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR PASSION
YET THIS CONFIDENCE DID NOT PREVENT HER TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION LEST DORRIFORTH SHOULD COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT
NO--NO--I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF MARRIAGE--AND HENRY RUSHBROOK I SHALL LEAVE MY HEIR
BUT IT IS PROPER THAT AFFECTION SHOULD HAVE SOME SHARE IN HIS BENEVOLENCE--AND HOW HEREAFTER WILL HE BE SO FIT AN OBJECT OF THE LOVE WHICH COMPASSION EXCITES AS HE IS AT PRESENT MISS WOODLEY ACQUIESCED
I THOUGHT SAID LORD ELMWOOD ANGRILY I THOUGHT I HAD GIVEN MY ORDERS UPON THE SUBJECT--DID NOT MY STEWARD WRITE THEM TO YOU HE DID MY LORD SAID SANDFORD HUMBLY BUT I WAS SET OUT BEFORE THEY ARRIVED HAS HE NOT TOLD YOU MY MIND THEN CRIED HE MORE ANGRILY STILL
AND THE MORE SHE RESPECTED HER GUARDIAN'S UNDERSTANDING THE LESS DID SHE CALL IN QUESTION HIS RELIGIOUS TENETS--IN ESTEEMING HIM SHE ESTEEMED ALL HIS NOTIONS
I'LL NOT BE TOO HARD UPON YOU--A HINT FROM ME WILL DO
HIS NAME--OFTEN IN COMPANY WITH THAT OF ANOTHER PHYSICIAN DR WARREN FOR WHOM TOO SHE HAD A PASSIONATE AFFECTION--OCCURS FREQUENTLY AMONG HER PAPERS
AND INDEED THE DELICACY OF THE DECLARATION AFTER THE MANY DENIALS WHICH YOU HAVE NO DOUBT GIVEN HIM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT THERE TO-NIGHT I HAVE SLEPT NO WHERE RETURNED HE
FROM THESE TWO SMALL OCCURRENCES RUSHBROOK WOULD FAIN HAVE EXTRACTED SOMETHING BY WHICH TO JUDGE THE STATE OF HIS MIND
UNEASY REPLIED SANDFORD UNEASY AT ANY TRIAL THIS WORLD CAN SEND
SANDFORD OBSERVING THIS PUT OUT HIS HAND AND TAKING HERS SHOOK IT KINDLY
SOLITUDE THAT FORMERLY CHARMED HIM WOULD AT THOSE MOMENTS HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN DEATH
SHE LONGED TO GO TO LONDON
AND IF HE DOES BUT WITH ALL DEFERENCE TO YOUR OPINION SAID MISS WOODLEY AND WITH ALL DEFERENCE DID SHE SPEAK DON'T YOU THINK MR SANDFORD THAT SECRECY UPON THIS OCCASION WOULD BE WICKED
HE COUGHED--DRANK HIS TEA--ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT--SOMETIMES READ--AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM.--NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
THOUGH SHE FOUND HERSELF MUCH LESS HAPPY THAN WHEN SHE WAS AT BATH BEFORE YET SHE FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT EVEN TO ENJOY ALL THAT PAST HAPPINESS BE AGAIN REDUCED TO THE BEING SHE WAS AT THAT PERIOD
LORD ELMWOOD ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND BROUGHT A CHAIR FOR HER TO SIT DOWN
OR THE DEARER VARIETY OF SPRING SUMMER AND AUTUMN
AND AS HIS MIND WAS ENRICHED WITH EVERY VIRTUE THAT COULD MAKE IT VALUABLE SO WAS HIS FACE ADORNED WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF THOSE VIRTUES--AND THEY NOT ONLY GAVE A LUSTRE TO HIS ASPECT BUT ADDED A HARMONIOUS SOUND TO ALL HE UTTERED
NOR WAS THE DUKE OF AVON WHO BEFORE THE DECEASE OF HIS FATHER AND ELDEST BROTHER WAS LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY AVERSE FROM GIVING HIM ALL THE SATISFACTION HE REQUIRED
BUT IN WHAT MANNER CAN I ACCOMPLISH THE SEPARATION CRIED SHE FOR TILL I MARRY WE ARE OBLIGED BY MY FATHER'S REQUEST TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE MISS MILNER ANSWERED MISS WOODLEY MUCH AS I RESPECT THE WILL OF A DYING MAN I REGARD YOUR AND MR DORRIFORTH'S PRESENT AND ETERNAL HAPPINESS MUCH MORE
AND HER GUARDIAN SO FAR FROM HAVING HIS THOUGHTS INCLINED TOWARDS HER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT PLEADED THIS LOVER'S CAUSE EVEN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN HE HAD PLEADED FOR SIR EDWARD AND LORD FREDERICK
MY LORD SAID SHE I HAVE HAD A VERY AGREEABLE MORNING
THE VERDICT WAS GUILTY SHE HEARD IT WITH COMPOSURE
RUSHBROOK FOLLOWED AND BEGGED WITH ALL THE EARNESTNESS HE FELT TO BE PERMITTED TO ACCOMPANY HIS UNCLE
TO WHICH QUESTION SANDFORD REPLIED BEAUTIFUL--SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFULLY SHE HAS GOT OVER HER UNEASINESS I SUPPOSE THEN SAID MRS HORTON--NOT DREAMING THAT SHE WAS ASKING THE QUESTIONS BEFORE HER NEW LOVER
BUT HAVING STEDFASTLY TAKEN THE RESOLUTION WHICH HE HAD JUST COMMUNICATED HE FOUND THAT RESOLUTION A CERTAIN RELIEF TO HIS MIND
FOR HE HAD NO CONSOLATION TO BESTOW THAT WAS SUITED TO HER MIND--HER FATHER HAD GIVEN NO ONE TOKEN OF REGRET FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
HORSES AND CARRIAGES DRIVING WITH FURY
AND TAKE THIS YOUNG MAN FROM THE DEPTH OF DESPAIR IN WHICH I SEE HE IS SUNK AND SAY YOU PARDON HIM LORD ELMWOOD MADE NO ANSWER--AND RUSHBROOK DRAWING STRONG INFERENCES OF HOPE FROM HIS SILENCE LIFTED UP HIS EYES FROM THE GROUND AND VENTURED TO LOOK IN HIS FACE
IMPOSSIBLE
THEY RETURNED THE SALUTE AND HE WAS GOING UP TO MISS MILNER AS IF TO ENQUIRE OF HER HEALTH WHEN MR SANDFORD LAYING DOWN HIS BOOK SAID MY LORD WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY I HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY REPLIED HE AND WALKING FROM THE CARD-TABLE WENT UP TO HIM
AND LOOKING AT LORD ELMWOOD SAW HIM TURN WHITE AS DEATH
WHAT DRESS DO YOU SAY SHE WENT IN CRIED SANDFORD TO HER
AND UPON COMMUNICATING IT MATILDA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE DARTED UPON HER KIND COMPANION A LOOK OF THE MOST CUTTING REPROACH AND HAUGHTY RESENTMENT
HE LOOKS VERY WELL OUR SERVANT TELLS US SAID MISS WOODLEY
AFTER MANY A SIGH PAID TO THE MEMORY OF HER FATHER MISS MILNER UPON THE TENTH OF NOVEMBER ARRIVED AT THE PLACE HALF-WAY ON HER JOURNEY TO TOWN WHERE DORRIFORTH AND MISS WOODLEY WERE EXPECTING HER
AND NO DISCREET OR RATHER INDISCREET ATTEMPTS TO RETRACT CAN MAKE ME CHANGE THESE SENTIMENTS I AM VERY SORRY SHE REPLIED CONFUSED AND TREMBLING
BUT HAPPILY THE VISCOUNT POSSESSED NO ARTS OF THIS KIND TO AFFECT A HEART JOINED WITH SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING AS MATILDA'S
IF I HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST INSTRUMENTAL TO THIS SORROW,"--SAID RUSHBROOK WITH A FACE AS MUCH AGITATED AS HIS MIND
AND DETERMINED TO BEAR AWAY THAT PRIZE BY FORCE WHICH NO ART WAS LIKELY TO PROCURE
YET SHE WAS CONFIRMED FROM THESE INCREASED SYMPTOMS IN WHAT SHE BEFORE ONLY SUSPECTED THAT LOVE MUST BE THE FOUNDATION OF HER CARE
SHE EMBRACED MISS WOODLEY
BLESS ME MR SANDFORD CAN'T YOU GUESS CRIED MRS HORTON WHO BY THIS TIME WAS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS INTENDED MARRIAGE HE DINES WITH MISS FENTON TO BE SURE NO REPLIED SANDFORD HE IS NOT THERE
MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN
I ONLY DESIRE YOU TO LOVE MISS FENTON
BUT BEFORE HIS LETTER ARRIVED TO SANDFORD SANDFORD ARRIVED IN TOWN
THEY BOTH BECAME SILENT AS THEY APPROACHED THE STREET WHERE THEY LIVED--FOR MISS WOODLEY HAVING ONCE REPRESENTED HER FEARS AND HAVING SUPPRESSED THEM IN RESIGNATION TO MISS MILNER'S BETTER JUDGMENT WOULD NOT REPEAT THEM--AND MISS MILNER WOULD NOT CONFESS THEY WERE NOW TROUBLING HER
SHE TRIES HER HAND AT A HERO RUSHBROOK AND SHE TURNS OUT A PRIG
AND WILL ASSIST YOU WITH ALL MY ADVICE AND MY EARNEST WISHES THAT IT MAY OBTAIN A RETURN THIS LETTER WAS ANOTHER OF THOSE EXCRUCIATING PLEASURES THAT ALMOST REDUCED MISS MILNER TO THE GRAVE
AND THE FERVENCY WITH WHICH HE HAD PRAYED SPOKE IN EVERY FEATURE
HER GUARDIAN LOOKED ASTONISHED
THE MAN HESITATED
UNLESS WHERE THE OFFENCE HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY SUCH EXAMPLES OF DIVINE VENGEANCE SUCH MIRACULOUS PUNISHMENTS IN THIS WORLD AS WELL AS ETERNAL PUNISHMENT IN THE OTHER AS SERVED TO EXAGGERATE THE WICKEDNESS
AND EVERY MOMENT THAT PASSED SHE TREMBLED LEST IT SHOULD BE THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH LORD ELMWOOD SHOULD RESOLVE TO BANISH MISS MILNER FROM HIS HEART
FOR THEY WERE IMPATIENT TO SEE THIS POOR FRAIL BEING WHOM THEY WERE LOADING WITH THEIR CENSURE
SHE VISITED REPEATEDLY WITHOUT SAYING WHERE OR WITH WHOM--KEPT LATER HOURS THAN USUAL--APPEARED IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS--SUNG LAUGHED AND NEVER HEAVED A SIGH--BUT WHEN SHE WAS ALONE
NOR WAS SANDFORD LESS SATISFIED
HE ADVISED MISS WOODLEY TO WRITE A PROPER LETTER TO HIM ON THE SUBJECT
THE NEXT TIME HE SAW HIS BENEFACTOR HE BEGAN TO FEEL A NEW ESTEEM AND REGARD FOR HIM FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S SAKE
WHY ARE YOU NOT AMONG THE REVELLERS MR SANDFORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH AN IRONICAL SNEER--(THE FIRST HER FEATURES EVER WORE)--"PRAY WERE NOT YOU INVITED TO DINE WITH THE COMPANY YES REPLIED SANDFORD
NO MY LORD ANSWERED SANDFORD SHE WISHED EVERY THING TO BE AS YOU WILLED SHE LEFT ME ALL THE TROUBLE THEN YOU MEAN NO GREAT TROUBLE SIR
DO NOT BE SO MUCH ALARMED MY DEAR SAID MISS WOODLEY
THE EXCESSIVE ALARM WHICH MISS MILNER DISCOVERED UPON THIS OCCASION WAS IMPUTED BY THE SERVANTS AND BY OTHERS WHO WERE WITNESSES OF IT TO HER AFFECTION FOR LORD FREDERICK
BUT HER DEAD SILENCE WAS ALMOST AS ALARMING TO SANDFORD AS HER RAGE HAD BEEN
LET NOT THE READER NEVERTHELESS IMAGINE THERE WAS IN THAT ARDENT EXPECTATION ONE IDEA WHICH THE MOST SPOTLESS MIND IN LOVE MIGHT NOT HAVE INDULGED WITHOUT REPROACH
CAN YOU LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND SAY THAT MR SANDFORD
THIS AT FIRST WAS PAINFUL TO HER--BUT RECOLLECTING THAT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS SHE WAS TO MEET HER GUARDIAN ALONE--TO SPEAK TO HIM AND HEAR HIM SPEAK TO HER ONLY--EVERY OTHER THOUGHT WAS ABSORBED IN THAT ONE AND SHE CONSIDERED WITH INDIFFERENCE THE UNEASINESS OR THE ANGER OF HER FRIEND
AND IF AFTER THE LONG ABSENCE WHICH MUST CONSEQUENTLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SHE COULD POSITIVELY AFFIRM THE SUPPRESSION OF HER PASSION WAS THE HAPPY RESULT SHE WOULD THEN TAKE HER WORD AND RISK THE DANGER OF SEEING THEM ONCE MORE RESIDE TOGETHER THIS CONCESSION HAVING BEEN OBTAINED THEY PARTED
AND WHO CAN TELL WHETHER EVEN THERE WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND A SELF-REVELATION
COULD MY POOR FATHER KNOW THE DAYS OF SORROW I HAVE EXPERIENCED SINCE HIS DEATH HOW WOULD HE REPENT HIS FATAL CHOICE OF A PROTECTOR THIS SENTENCE IN WHICH HIS FRIEND'S MEMORY WAS RECALLED WITH AN ADDITIONAL ALLUSION TO HER LONG AND SECRET LOVE FOR HIM AFFECTED LORD ELMWOOD MUCH--HE WAS MOVED BUT ASHAMED OF BEING SO AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CONQUERED THE PROPENSITY TO FORGIVE
FOR HE MUST NOW REGRET BEYOND MEASURE HIS FOLLY IN TAKING PRIEST'S ORDERS THUS DEPRIVING HIMSELF OF THE HOPES OF AN HEIR SO THAT HIS TITLE AT HIS DEATH WILL BE LOST BY NO MEANS REPLIED MR FLEETMOND
HE ONCE AGAIN APPROACHED HER AND AGAIN WAS GOING TO SEIZE HER HAND
SHE WAS HIGHLY OFFENDED AT THIS INSULT AND DECLARED FROM THAT MOMENT SHE BANISHED HIM FROM HER HEART FOR EVER AND TO PROVE THAT SHE SET HIS LOVE AND HIS ANGER AT EQUAL DEFIANCE SHE IMMEDIATELY ORDERED HER CARRIAGE AND SAID SHE WAS GOING TO SOME OF HER ACQUAINTANCE WHOM SHE KNEW TO HAVE TICKETS AND WITH WHOM SHE WOULD FIX UPON THE HABIT SHE WAS TO APPEAR IN AT THE MASQUERADE
ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW
ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW
ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW
ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW
ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW
FOR THOUGH HE SPOKE HASTILY IT WAS RATHER LIKE A MAN FRIGHTENED THAN ASSURED
HE WOULD HAVE GONE PART OF THE WAY WITH HER BUT FOR THE EXTREME ILLNESS OF LORD ELMWOOD IN WHOSE CHAMBER HE PASSED MOST OF THE DAY AND SLEPT IN ELMWOOD HOUSE EVERY NIGHT
FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS HE SUFFERED THE TORMENT OF THESE REFLECTIONS HOPING THAT HE SHOULD COME TO AN EXPLANATION OF ALL HE FELT BY A FORTUNATE MEETING WITH MISS WOODLEY
NOR HAS MISS MILNER HAD VISITORS ASKED HE
THE DEATH OF HER AUNT MRS HORTON HAD LEFT HER SOLELY RELYING ON THE BOUNTY OF LADY ELMWOOD AND NOW HER DEATH HAD LEFT HER TOTALLY DEPENDANT UPON THE EARL--FOR LADY ELMWOOD THOUGH SHE HAD SEPARATE EFFECTS HAD LONG BEFORE HER DEATH DECLARED IT WAS NOT HER INTENTION TO LEAVE A SENTENCE BEHIND HER IN THE FORM OF A WILL
MY DEAR MISS WOODLEY WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE TO PROTECT ME NAY RETURNED LORD MARGRAVE STIFLING A FIT OF LAUGHTER I SHOULD THINK THE OLD PRIEST WOULD BE AS GOOD A CHAMPION AS THE LADY THE REMEMBRANCE OF SANDFORD WITH ALL HIS KINDNESS NOW RUSHED SO FORCIBLY ON MATILDA'S MIND THAT SHE SHED A SHOWER OF TEARS ON THINKING HOW MUCH HE FELT AND WOULD CONTINUE TO FEEL FOR HER SITUATION
AND THOUGH THEY HAD LEFT A LANGUOR UPON HIS FACE CONTENT WAS IN HIS VOICE IN HIS MANNERS IN EVERY WORD AND ACTION
BUT WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THEM BOTH JEALOUSY NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE MIND BUT EVERY FIBRE OF THEIR FRAME
HER FRIEND LOOKED AT HER AS IF TO DISCOVER SOME LURKING WISH ADVERSE TO ALL THESE PROTESTATIONS BUT SHE COULD NOT DISCERN ONE
THAT WHOEVER LORD ELMWOOD MARRIES HE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY RETURNED SHE WITH THE UTMOST COMMAND OF HER VOICE AND LOOKS
I THANK YOU MY LORD DO NOT TORTURE ME WITH THIS SUSPICION
BUT HE HAD NOT SEEN HER THREE TIMES BEFORE HE CALLED HER THE MOST INSUFFERABLE OF HEAVEN'S CREATURES AND VOWED THERE WAS MORE CHARMING VARIATION IN THE PLAIN FEATURES OF MISS WOODLEY
HOW SO CRIED DORRIFORTH EAGERLY WITH HIS OWN EYES MOISTENED WITH JOY NEARLY AS MUCH AS HER'S WERE WITH GRATITUDE
YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED MY LORD SAID MRS HORTON
SHE SAW FROM HER WINDOWS THE SERVANTS RUNNING ACROSS THE YARDS AND PARK
PERHAPS AN ANXIETY FOR HIS WARD'S CONDUCT WAS NOT AMONG THE LEAST
SANDFORD CAST HIS EYES UPON HIM WITH A LOOK OF SURPRISE AND CONTEMPT
THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW HIM AFTER THE RECEIPT OF HIS LETTER WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY--SHE HAD A LITTLE CONCERT OF AMATEURS OF MUSIC AND WAS HERSELF SINGING AND PLAYING WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM
AND DID HE HAND YOU INTO YOUR COACH ASKED LORD ELMWOOD EARNESTLY
HER PLEASANTRY WAS IMMEDIATELY SUPPRESSED AND SHE THREW OPEN THE SASH AND HELD HER HEAD OUT AT THE WINDOW TO CONCEAL THE EMBARRASSMENT THESE LINES HAD OCCASIONED
AND WHENEVER LORD ELMWOOD WISHED TO SHEW A KINDNESS TO MISS MILNER WITHOUT DIRECTING IT IMMEDIATELY TO HER HE TOOK HIS NEPHEW UPON HIS KNEE TALKED TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WAS GLAD THEY HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED IN THE VARIOUS THOUGH DELICATE STRUGGLES FOR POWER BETWEEN MISS MILNER AND HER GUARDIAN THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON A WITNESS TO THESE INCIDENTS WHO DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT ALL WOULD AT LAST END IN WEDLOCK--FOR THE MOST COMMON OBSERVER PERCEIVED THAT ARDENT LOVE WAS THE FOUNDATION OF EVERY DISCONTENT AS WELL AS OF EVERY JOY THEY EXPERIENCED
AND HE AT LENGTH BEHELD THOSE FAULTS IN THEIR TRUE COLOURS THOUGH PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT BY THE PREJUDICE OF MR SANDFORD
THE MOMENT I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT YOUR AFFECTION WAS BUT COUNTERFEITED HE WILL NO LONGER REFUSE ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE THEN AT ALL EVENTS I AM UNDONE EXCLAIMED MISS MILNER FOR THE DUEL IS HORRIBLE EVEN BEYOND EVERY THING ELSE HOW SO RETURNED MISS WOODLEY SINCE YOU HAVE DECLARED YOU DO NOT CARE FOR LORD FREDERICK BUT ARE YOU SO BLIND RETURNED MISS MILNER WITH A DEGREE OF MADNESS IN HER LOOKS AS TO BELIEVE I DO NOT CARE FOR MR DORRIFORTH
LORD ELMWOOD TOO AT THIS TIME WAS LYING DANGEROUSLY ILL OF A FEVER
THE CHILD OF A SISTER ONCE BELOVED WHO MARRIED A YOUNG OFFICER AGAINST HER BROTHER'S CONSENT WAS AT THE AGE OF THREE YEARS LEFT AN ORPHAN DESTITUTE OF ALL SUPPORT BUT FROM HIS UNCLE'S GENEROSITY
WHAT PASSION THUS AGITATED LORD ELMWOOD AT THIS CRISIS IT IS HARD TO DEFINE--PERHAPS IT WAS INDIGNATION AT MISS MILNER'S IMPRUDENCE AND EXULTATION AT BEING ON THE POINT OF REVENGE--PERHAPS IT WAS EMOTION ARISING FROM JOY TO FIND THAT SHE WAS SAFE--PERHAPS IT WAS PERTURBATION AT THE REGRET HE FELT THAT HE MUST UPBRAID HER--PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ONE ALONE OF THESE SENSATIONS BUT ALL OF THEM COMBINED
FOR THE IMPRESSION WHICH THIS INCIDENT HAD MADE WAS DEEP AND NOT EASILY TO BE ERASED
SHE WAS OBLIGED ALSO TO BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME HIS LOVELY CHARGE.--LOVELY BEYOND DESCRIPTION
NO SOONER WAS THE CHAISE WITH ALL ITS ATTENDANTS OUT OF SIGHT THAN LADY MATILDA WAS CONDUCTED BY MISS WOODLEY FROM HER LONELY RETREAT INTO THAT PART OF THE HOUSE FROM WHENCE HER FATHER HAD JUST DEPARTED--AND SHE VISITED EVERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD SO LONG RESIDED WITH A PLEASING CURIOSITY THAT FOR A WHILE DIVERTED HER GRIEF
FOR AS SHE NOW MEANT TO TORMENT HIM BY WHAT SHE SAID SHE NO LONGER CONSTRAINED HERSELF TO SILENCE--AND AS HE HARBOURED THE SAME KIND INTENTION TOWARDS HER HE HAD NO LONGER ANY OBJECTION TO MAKE A REPLY AND THEREFORE ANSWERED NO MADAM IF IT DEPENDED UPON MY PERMISSION YOU SHOULD NOT KNOW NOT ANY THING SIR I DARE SAY
AND MISS MILNER WHOM HE TENDERLY LOVED COULD PUT ON NO CHANGE OR APPEAR IN NO NEW CHARACTER THAT DID NOT FOR THE TIME SHE ADOPTED IT SEEM TO BECOME HER
NOR DO I
BUT HE SEEMED BOTH ASHAMED AND ANGRY THEY DID AND WAS GOING TO THROW THE PAPER UPON THE FIRE--HE HOWEVER SUDDENLY CHECKED HIS HAND AND PUTTING IT HASTILY INTO HIS POCKET WENT TO BED
YES REPLIED SANDFORD AND YOU ARE THE MISTRESS OF IT NOW TILL YOUR FATHER ARRIVES GOOD GOD EXCLAIMED SHE AND WILL HE EVER ARRIVE
THERE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS REPLY AND HIS EMBARRASSMENT SOMETHING WHICH HIS UNCLE DISTINGUISHED FROM A FREE CONCURRENCE
ELMWOOD HOUSE SEPT
SOFTENED BY THE DELICACY OF HER SEX THE EXTREME TENDERNESS OF HER HEART AND THE MELANCHOLY OF HER SITUATION
RUSHBROOK WAS BROUGHT HOME
VANITY DEFINED INTO ALL THE SPECIES OF PRIDE VAIN-GLORY SELF-APPROBATION--AN INORDINATE DESIRE OF ADMIRATION AND AN IMMODERATE ENJOYMENT OF THE ART OF PLEASING FOR HER OWN INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS AND NOT FOR THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS
NOR WOULD HE GIVE THE NEIGHBOURS OR SERVANTS REASON TO SUPPOSE THE DAUGHTER OF THEIR LORD WAS ADMITTED INTO HIS HOUSE IN ANY OTHER SITUATION THAN THAT IN WHICH SHE REALLY WAS PERMITTED TO BE THERE
IT IS TRUE SHE HAD A WEIGHT OF CARE UPON HER HEART EVEN HEAVIER THAN USUAL BUT THE BURDEN HAD OVERCOME HER STRENGTH
EVEN ON THAT VERY DAY AFTER THE SACRED CEREMONY WAS OVER MISS MILNER--(WITH ALL THE FEARS THE TREMORS THE SUPERSTITION OF HER SEX)--FELT AN EXCRUCIATING SHOCK
AND THROUGH HER CARESSES AND OFFICIOUS PRAISES OF HIM FIRST GAVE HIM THAT POWER WHICH HE NOW POSSESSES OVER HIS UNCLE
WE MAY NOT FIND IT CONVENIENT TO MEET THIS MANY A DAY
1795
YET WHATEVER HIS MANNERS NOW WERE THEY DID NOT REMOVE FROM HER RECOLLECTION WHAT THEY HAD BEEN--SHE RECALLED WITH DELIGHT THE ARDOUR WITH WHICH HE HAD FIRST DECLARED HIS PASSION TO HER AND THE THOUSAND PROOFS HE HAD SINCE GIVEN OF ITS REALITY
HIS INCOME WAS BY NO MEANS CONFINED BUT APPROACHING TO AFFLUENCE
FOR NEAR TWO HOURS HE WAS SO.----AT LENGTH AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL FROM SPEAKING DURING WHICH THEY WAITED WITH ANXIETY FOR WHAT HE MIGHT NEXT SAY HE TURNED TO LADY MATILDA AND SAID YOU DON'T ASK FOR YOUR FATHER MY DEAR I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS PROPER SHE REPLIED TIMIDLY
HE HAD GROSSLY OFFENDED THE FIRM FRIEND OF LADY MATILDA BY THE UNRESERVED AND WANTON USE OF HER NAME
AND AS RUSHBROOK AFTER REPLYING WALKED AWAY SANDFORD CALLED TO HER CROSSLY COME COME ALONG BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE PUT OUT HIS ELBOW FOR HER TO TAKE HOLD OF HIS ARM
AND STILL WHERE MY UNWILLINGNESS TO THWART YOUR INCLINATIONS MIGHT NOT HAVE PERMITTED ME TO CONTEND WITH THEM NOT A WORD OF REPLY DID THIS DEMAND
BUT HER FATHER'S IMPLACABILITY CONFOUNDED THEM ALL
LADY ELMWOOD DIED WITHOUT EVER BEING DISTURBED WITH IT
CHAPTER I
CHAPTER I
CHAPTER I
IN ELIZABETH'S EIGHTH YEAR HER FATHER DIED
THE BOY RUSHBROOK IS BECOME A MAN AND THE APPARENT HEIR OF LORD ELMWOOD'S FORTUNE
BUT ON A POSITIVE REFUSAL FROM THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH AN INTRUSION SHE WAS OBLIGED AT LENGTH TO GO BY HERSELF
LORD FREDERICK MAKES PART OF MY AMUSEMENT BUT COULD NEVER CONSTITUTE MY FELICITY MISS WOODLEY SAID DORRIFORTH DO YOU COMPREHEND YOUR FRIEND IN THE SAME LITERAL AND UNEQUIVOCAL SENSE THAT I DO CERTAINLY I DO SIR AND PRAY MISS WOODLEY SAID HE WERE THOSE THE SENTIMENTS WHICH YOU HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED MISS WOODLEY HESITATED--HE CONTINUED
OH DO NOT PAY LORD ELMWOOD'S MOTIVE SO ILL A COMPLIMENT I DO NOT SAY THAT HE IS THE ABSOLUTE CAUSE RETURNED SANDFORD
THE NEXT MORNING EACH BREAKFASTED IN HIS SEPARATE APARTMENTS--MORE COMPANY DINED WITH THEM--IN THE EVENING AND AT SUPPER LORD ELMWOOD WAS FROM HOME
SHE READ PART OF A NEW OPERA PLAYED UPON HER GUITAR MUSED SIGHED OCCASIONALLY TALKED WITH MISS WOODLEY AND SO PASSED THE TEDIOUS HOURS TILL NEAR TEN WHEN MRS HORTON ASKED MR SANDFORD TO PLAY A GAME AT PIQUET AND ON HIS EXCUSING HIMSELF MISS MILNER OFFERED IN HIS STEAD AND WAS GLADLY ACCEPTED
AS SOON AS SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER FIRST ASTONISHMENT AND JOY SHE WROTE TO MISS WOODLEY AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER
AND NOW I HAVE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF ITS EXCESS INSTEAD OF STOOPING TO HIM I WAIT IN THE CERTAIN EXPECTATION OF HIS SUBMISSION TO ME CHAPTER XI
ON WHICH HIS UNCLE SAID TO HIM--"I SHALL POSTPONE EXECUTING YOUR OBEDIENCE TO MY LATE ORDERS TILL YOU THINK FIT ONCE MORE TO PROVOKE THEM--AND THEN NOT EVEN SANDFORD SHALL DARE TO PLEAD YOUR EXCUSE RUSHBROOK BOWED
THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THEY DID NOT EVEN MENTION HIS NAME
SHE WAS BECOME VERY THIN AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID BLOOM THAT USED TO ADORN HER CHEEKS HER WHOLE COMPLEXION WAS OF A DEADLY PALE--HER COUNTENANCE NO LONGER EXPRESSED HOPE OR FEAR BUT A FIXED MELANCHOLY--SHE SHED NO TEARS BUT WAS ALL SADNESS
MISS MILNER IN A LETTER TO HER DISTANT RELATION AT BATH WAS TO COMPLAIN OF THE MELANCHOLY OF A COUNTRY LIFE WHICH SHE WAS TO SAY HER GUARDIAN IMPOSED UPON HER
FOR THE FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE CRIED HE WITH A MANLY SORROW I WISH I HAD NEVER KNOWN HER FATHER NAY SAID MRS HORTON WHO EXPECTED EVERY THING TO HAPPEN JUST AS SHE WISHED FOR NEITHER AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION THE BEST COMPANY OR LONG EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CULTIVATE OR BRIGHTEN THIS GOOD LADY'S UNDERSTANDING NAY SAID SHE I AM SURE MR DORRIFORTH YOU WILL SOON CONVERT HER FROM ALL HER EVIL WAYS DEAR ME RETURNED LADY EVANS I AM SURE I NEVER MEANT TO HINT AT ANY THING EVIL--AND FOR WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL GIVE YOU UP MY AUTHORS IF YOU PLEASE
FOR THOUGH FREQUENTLY TOGETHER THEY WERE NEVER SOCIABLE
NOR DID MISS MILNER SEE HER GUARDIAN AFTER HIS FIRST RETURN FROM THAT ENGAGEMENT BEFORE THE FOLLOWING NOON
AND UPON THIS OCCASION AND FROM HIM IT WAS AN EXPRESSION MOST PRECIOUS
IN MISS MILNER IT WAS SO UNITED
DAYLIGHT NOW NO LONGER PEEPED BUT STARED UPON THEM
HE CONSEQUENTLY BECAME MORE RESERVED AND MORE AUSTERE THAN HE HAD BEEN SINCE HIS FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER
LORD ELMWOOD'S ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BEFORE
MISS MILNER TO AVOID HEARING A REPETITION OF THAT WHICH GAVE HER PAIN EVEN TO RECOLLECT ROSE IN ORDER TO RETIRE INTO HER OWN APARTMENT BUT WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AGAIN TILL SHE RECEIVED THE ASSISTANCE OF LORD ELMWOOD AND HER FRIEND WHO LED HER INTO HER DRESSING ROOM
A FEW MONTHS LATER SHE DID THE GREAT DEED OF HER LIFE
HE FOUND IT COMPOSED TO WHAT IT HAD BEEN BUT STILL STRONGLY MARKED WITH AGITATION
BUT FINDING THIS HAD NOT THE EFFECT OF GAINING COMPLIANCE WITH HER ADVICE SHE VARIED HER MANNERS AND BEGAN BY LESS SUBMISSIVE MEANS TO ATTEMPT AN INFLUENCE
WHEN HE FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT BY WATCHING EVERY LOOK AND MOTION OF LORD ELMWOOD HIS PENETRATION WOULD BE ABLE TO DISCOVER THE STATE OF HIS HEART AND HOW HE MEANT TO ACT
IT WAS NOT A COMMON CHANGE FROM JOY TO SORROW FROM CONTENT TO UNEASINESS WHICH MISS MILNER DISCOVERED--SHE FELT AND SHE EXPRESSED ANGUISH--LORD ELMWOOD WAS ALARMED AND SHOCKED
IN A GREATER DEGREE THAN MOST PEOPLE HE PRACTISED THIS DOCTRINE
TO ENJOY WITH GRATITUDE WHAT HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY SHOULD BESTOW AND TO BEAR WITH SUBMISSION WHATEVER IN ITS VENGEANCE IT MIGHT INFLICT
AMONG THE REST THREE WERE SENT TO MISS MILNER
BUT AS A LOVER I WILL NOT YET THAT IS THE WAY NEVER TO HAVE HIM FOR A HUSBAND AS HE PLEASES--FOR IF HE WILL NOT SUBMIT TO BE MY LOVER I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO BE HIS WIFE--NOR HAS HE THE AFFECTION THAT I REQUIRE IN A HUSBAND THUS THE OLD SENTIMENTS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN PREVENTED A SEPARATION TILL TOWARDS MORNING
AND CERTAINLY IT IS FOR THE HONOUR OF THE CATHOLICS THAT THIS EARLDOM SHOULD CONTINUE IN A CATHOLIC FAMILY
YOUNG AS LADY MATILDA WAS DURING THE LIFE OF HER MOTHER NEITHER HER YOUTH NOR THE RECLUSE STATE IN WHICH SHE LIVED HAD PRECLUDED HER FROM THE NOTICE AND SOLICITATIONS OF A NOBLEMAN WHO HAD PROFESSED HIMSELF HER LOVER
SHE TURNED TO HIM WITH A LOOK OF GRATITUDE
THE INSTANT DORRIFORTH WAS INTRODUCED TO HER BY MISS WOODLEY AS HER GUARDIAN AND HER DECEASED FATHER'S MOST BELOVED FRIEND SHE BURST INTO TEARS KNELT DOWN TO HIM FOR A MOMENT AND PROMISED EVER TO OBEY HIM AS HER FATHER
BUT THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE PUT HER UPON HER GUARD NOT TO EXPRESS THE LIKE AND SHE SAID IN A COOL CONSTRAINED MANNER SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HIS LORDSHIP THE RESERVE WITH WHICH SHE SPOKE GAVE LORD FREDERICK IMMEDIATE SUSPICION WHO WAS IN THE COACH WITH HER AND TURNING HIS HEAD QUICKLY HE MET THE STERN EYE OF DORRIFORTH
AND AT HALF AFTER TEN THE FAMILY WITHOUT ANY VISITOR MET AT SUPPER
FOR SANDFORD AND HE OFTEN STOPPED ON ONE SPOT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AS IF THE INTEREST OF THE SUBJECT HAD SO ENGAGED THEM THEY STOOD STILL WITHOUT KNOWING IT
YOU KNOW NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN RESPECT FOR HIM PREVENTED MY DIVORCING HER
YET THERE IS A FIRST CAUSE STILL TO WHOM I CANNOT HERE FORBEAR TO MENTION MY OBLIGATIONS
AND NOW THOUGH HE MAINTAINS AND I DARE SAY LOVES HER CHILD YET YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU BROUGHT HIM HOME THAT HE WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM IN HIS SIGHT POOR MISS MILNER SAID MISS WOODLEY IN THE MOST PITYING ACCENTS
BUT DORRIFORTH CALLED TO HIM TO STAY AND SAID WITH WARMTH TELL ME MR SANDFORD BY WHAT POWER BY WHAT PERSUASION I CAN PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO CONFIDE IN ME AS HER FRIEND
AFTER FEELING WHOLLY INDIFFERENT ABOUT DR GISBORNE--VERY HAPPY BUT FOR ILL HEALTH ILL LOOKS C
A LETTER FROM LORD ELMWOOD REPLIED MISS MILNER
ORDER BEDS HERE DIRECTLY AND SOME PROPER PERSON TO SIT UP AND ATTEND HER SHE COULD ONLY TURN TO HIM WITH A LOOK OF LOVE AND DUTY
MISS MILNER WAS DISPLEASED AT THE ATTEMPT AND EXCLAIMED WHAT
AT LENGTH DORRIFORTH SAID AND IT IS YOUR FIRM INTENTION NEVER TO BECOME HIS WIFE TO WHICH SHE ANSWERED--"AT PRESENT IT IS AT PRESENT
IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES INDEED SIR THIS IS VERY ODD SAID MRS HORTON
AND AS THAT WAS THE CASE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO CARRY THE CORPSE SO FAR AT THE WORD CORPSE LORD ELMWOOD SHRUNK AND LOOKED SHOCKED BEYOND MEASURE--BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF SAID I AM SORRY FOR IT
HER CHILD WAS TOO YOUNG TO ADVISE HER ON THIS SUBJECT HER FRIEND TOO DISINTERESTED
AND FRIVOLOUS AS IT WAS DREW FROM IT STRONG CONCLUSIONS OF RUSHBROOK'S INSOLENCE AND POWER
JUST HOWEVER AS THE COACH STOPPED AT THE DOOR SHE HAD THE FORECAST AND THE HUMILITY TO SAY WE WILL NOT TELL MR DORRIFORTH THE CHILD IS HIS NEPHEW UNLESS HE SHOULD APPEAR FOND AND PLEASED WITH HIM AND THEN I THINK WE MAY VENTURE WITHOUT ANY DANGER THIS WAS AGREED
HE LOVED HIS SISTER TOO TENDERLY LOVED HER AND YET WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE RESOLUTION AND PASSED HIS WORD THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN--EVEN UPON HER DEATH-BED HE WOULD NOT RETRACT IT--NO ENTREATIES COULD PREVAIL UPON HIM
MR RUSHBROOK CONTINUED MISS WOODLEY REPLIED TO YOUR FATHER THAT HIS INDISPOSITION WAS BUT A SLIGHT NERVOUS FEVER AND HE WOULD DEFER A PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE TILL HE WENT TO LONDON"--ON WHICH LORD ELMWOOD SAID AND WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO BE THERE?"--HE REPLIED WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO I SUPPOSE MY LORD BUT YOUR FATHER ANSWERED I DO NOT MEAN TO GO MYSELF TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS NO INDEED MY LORD SAID MR SANDFORD WITH SURPRISE
NO MISS WOODLEY NOR EVER WILL
MRS HORTON MISS WOODLEY MISS MILNER AND MR DORRIFORTH ACCOMPANIED BY MISS FENTON WHOM MISS MILNER KNOWING IT TO BE THE WISH OF HER GUARDIAN INVITED FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE HER MARRIAGE TO HER COUNTRY SEAT
THE WEEK IN WHICH HE WAS TO COME WAS AT LENGTH FIXED AND SOME PART OF HIS RETINUE WAS ARRIVED BEFORE HIM
AND ONE BEAUTIFUL MORNING ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK SEEING MISS WOODLEY WALKING ON THE LAWN BEFORE THE HOUSE SHE HASTILY TOOK HER HAT TO JOIN HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS DRESSED IN SAID MRS HORTON
AT A DINNER GIVEN BY LORD ELMWOOD SIR EDWARD WAS ANNOUNCED AS AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR
SHE HAD STEPPED BEYOND THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT WHEN PERCEIVING A VISITOR SHE HASTILY WITHDREW
BUT SHE TOLD ME HER LETTER CONCERNED NONE BUT ME TO EXPLAIN PERFECTLY TO MATILDA LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER AND THAT SHE MIGHT PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND UPON WHAT TERMS SHE WAS ADMITTED INTO ELMWOOD CASTLE SANDFORD NOW READ THE LETTER TO HER
THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS WERE AGREED UPON
BUT IN PREPARING TO LEAVE HIS FRIEND HIS PUPIL HIS PATRON AND YET HIM WHO UPON MOST OCCASIONS IMPLICITLY OBEYED HIS WILL THE SPIRITUAL GOT THE BETTER OF THE TEMPORAL MAN AND HE DETERMINED TO STAY LEST IN TOTALLY ABANDONING HIM TO THE PURSUIT OF HIS OWN PASSIONS HE SHOULD MAKE HIS PUNISHMENT EVEN GREATER THAN HIS OFFENCE
EXTREMELY WELL INDEED ANSWERED SANDFORD
AM I TO GIVE HIM ANY REASON FOR YOUR DISOBEYING HIM I TELL YOU AGAIN THAT I DARE NOT NAME THE CAUSE THEN WHY DO YOU SUBMIT TO A POWER YOU ARE ASHAMED TO OWN I AM NOT ASHAMED--I GLORY IN IT.--ARE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR ESTEEM FOR LADY MATILDA OH
A CHEERFUL REPLY FROM HER TO A QUESTION OF MISS WOODLEY'S EMBARRASSED HIM STILL MORE--HE WISHED THAT SHE HAD BEEN SULLEN HE THEN WOULD HAVE HAD A TEMPTATION OR PRETENCE TO HAVE BEEN SULLEN TOO
CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF HER FATHER I DO SIR--BUT I WAS LIKEWISE THE HUSBAND OF HER MOTHER
INSTEAD OF THAT AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY WHICH MISS WOODLEY USED TO EXERT UPON HER SLIGHTEST ILLNESS OR AFFLICTION SHE NOW ADDRESSED HER IN AN UNPITYING TONE AND SAID MISS MILNER YOU HAVE HEARD LORD FREDERICK IS SAFE YOU HAVE THEREFORE NOTHING TO ALARM YOU NOR DID SHE RUN TO HOLD A SMELLING BOTTLE OR TO RAISE HER HEAD
DREW HER TO HIM
LORD MARGRAVE ON WHOM LORD ELMWOOD HAD NOT EVEN CAST A LOOK NOW LEFT THE ROOM
NO CRIED SANDFORD I AM SURE HE DOES NOT
MY LORD REPLIED HE THAT IS WHAT I MUST NOT TELL YOU DEFER IT THEN TILL YOU ARE WELL SAID LORD ELMWOOD
SHE MADE NO ANSWER
SHE MADE NO ANSWER
FOR THE ARDOUR OF SPEAKING BEING OVER HE WAITED HIS SENTENCE WITH LESS CONSTANCY OF MIND THAN HE EXPECTED HE SHOULD
FOR THERE WAS SOMETHING MUCH MORE CONSPICUOUSLY DISTRESSING IN ENTERING WHERE HE ALREADY WAS THAN HAD HIS UNCLE COME IN AFTER HIM
THE STEWARD WAS WITH HIM AND AS THEY CAME UP CLOSE BY HER SIDE GIFFARD OBSERVING HIM LOOK AT HER EARNESTLY SAID SOFTLY BUT SO AS SHE HEARD HIM MY LORD IT IS MISS WOODLEY LORD ELMWOOD TOOK OFF HIS HAT INSTANTLY--AND WITH AN APPARENT FRIENDLY WARMTH LAYING HOLD OF HER HAND HE SAID INDEED MISS WOODLEY I DID NOT KNOW YOU--I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND WHILE HE SPOKE SHOOK HER HAND WITH A CORDIALITY WHICH HER TENDER HEART COULD NOT BEAR--AND NEVER DID SHE FEEL SO HARD A STRUGGLE AS TO RESTRAIN HER TEARS
WHAT LOVER MR SANDFORD?--EXPLAIN THEY WERE NOW ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE
SHE FOR HER PART FLATTERED HERSELF THAT HIS GOING TO WINDSOR WAS INTENDED IN ORDER TO GIVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY OF PASSING THE EVENING AS SHE PLEASED WITHOUT HIS BEING OBLIGED TO KNOW OF IT AND CONSEQUENTLY TO COMPLAIN
NOR WILL I UNDERTAKE TO DECIDE BETWIXT YOU
HE CAUGHT AT THOSE TIMES HER RESPECT HER DIFFIDENCE NAY EVEN HER EMBARRASSMENT
DORRIFORTH SAW HER CONCERN UPON THIS LAST TRIFLING OCCASION WITH A SECRET PLEASURE AND AN ADMIRATION THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXCITED
NO THIS SHUDDERING IS ONLY FRIGHT REPLIED MISS WOODLEY--"SAY TO HIM YOU ARE SORRY AND BEG HIS PARDON I CANNOT SAID SHE IF MR SANDFORD IS WITH HIM THE SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE AND MISS WOODLEY WENT IN
THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAS LATELY LOST HER FATHER MRS HILLGRAVE WAS THE WIFE OF A MERCHANT WHO HAD MET WITH SEVERE LOSSES
BUT HE WILL BEHOLD ME WITH NEGLECT AND THAT WILL BE MISERY
YOU KNOW YOUR POWER OVER HIM AND ALL MAY YET BE WELL SHE TURNED HER SPEAKING EYES UPON HER FRIEND THE TEARS STARTING FROM THEM HER LIPS TREMBLING--"DO I NOT APPEAR SORRY SHE CRIED
MISS WOODLEY WHO HAD BEEN A SILENT OBSERVER FOR SOME TIME NOW THOUGHT A WORD OR TWO FROM HER WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE RATHER THAN TROUBLESOME
WE SHAN'T BREAKFAST BEFORE HALF AFTER SIX CONTINUED HE I DARE SAY
I SHOULD PRESUME TO ADD MY OPINION WHERE YOU MIGHT BEST TAKE UP YOUR ABODE
STILL LORD ELMWOOD PROTRACTED A RESOLUTION THAT HE WAS DETERMINED HE WOULD NEVER BREAK WHEN TAKEN
YES ANSWERED THE OTHER IT WAS THAT I MEANT BY THE JOY IT MIGHT PROBABLY GIVE HIM BEYOND THE POSSESSION OF HIS ESTATE AND TITLE HOW HE MARRIED SAID LADY LUNEHAM HAS HE NOT TAKEN A VOW NEVER TO MARRY YES ANSWERED MR FLEETMOND BUT THERE ARE NO RELIGIOUS VOWS FROM WHICH THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF AT ROME CANNOT GRANT A DISPENSATION AS THOSE COMMANDMENTS WHICH ARE MADE BY THE CHURCH THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS THE POWER TO REVOKE
WHEN MISS MILNER CALLED MISS WOODLEY BACK SAYING STAY YOU WITH ME
AND AS TO HIS PROLONGING HIS STAY THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE SPORT--OR INDEED HAD ANY THING MORE MATERIAL SWAYED HIM WHO COULD PENETRATE WHETHER IT WAS THE EFFECT OF THE LENITY OR THE SEVERITY HE HAD DEALT TOWARDS HIS CHILD
YOU SEEM UNHAPPY MY LORD SAID HE WITH A SMILE
BUT MY HEAD ACHED
BUT STILL HOLDING HIS FINGERS IN THE PAGES HE WAS READING SAID AND WHY ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED OF MISS WOODLEY'S COMPANY
SANDFORD GOING INTO LORD ELMWOOD'S LIBRARY SOON AFTER HIS RELATION HAD LEFT HIM EXPRESSED HIS SURPRISE AT FINDING HE WAS GONE
BUT SANDFORD WITHOUT ATTENDING TO HIM WALKED NEGLIGENTLY INTO THE HALL AND BEFORE THEY ADVANCED MANY STEPS THEY WERE MET BY LORD ELMWOOD
THERE WERE INCESSANT PROPOSITIONS--BUT ALAS
WHEN SHE INTREATED YOUR FATHER TO TAKE HIM
MISS FENTON REPLIED AS TO THAT MY LORD I SEE NO REASON WHY MR DORRIFORTH AND LORD FREDERICK SHOULD NOT NOW BE FRIENDS CERTAINLY SAID MRS HORTON
I LEAVE A CHILD--I WILL NOT CALL HER MINE
ANOTHER COMPLAINT WAS AS USUAL EXTREME LATE HOURS AND OFTEN COMPANY THAT HE DID NOT APPROVE
HE ROSE ON SEEING HIM AND PROCEEDED TO THE SPORT AS BEFORE
HER STYLE IT IS TRUE IS ON THE WHOLE POOR
LORD ELMWOOD WILL SOON RETURN AND WE MAY BOTH OF US BE HURRIED TO TOWN IMMEDIATELY--THEN HOW FOR A TEDIOUS WINTER COULD I ENDURE THE REFLEXION THAT I WAS DESPISED NAY PERHAPS CONSIDERED AS AN OBJECT OF INGRATITUDE BY THE ONLY CHILD OF MY DECEASED BENEFACTRESS MATILDA REPLIED WITH ALL HER FATHER'S HAUGHTINESS DEPEND UPON IT SIR IF YOU SHOULD EVER ENTER MY THOUGHTS IT WILL ONLY BE AS AN OBJECT OF ENVY SUFFER ME THEN MADAM SAID HE AS AN EARNEST THAT YOU DO NOT THINK WORSE OF ME THAN I MERIT SUFFER ME TO BE SOMETIMES ADMITTED INTO YOUR PRESENCE SHE WOULD SCARCE PERMIT HIM TO FINISH THE PERIOD BEFORE SHE REPLIED THIS IS THE LAST TIME SIR WE SHALL EVER MEET DEPEND UPON IT--UNLESS INDEED LORD ELMWOOD SHOULD DELEGATE TO YOU THE CONTROUL OF ME--_HIS COMMANDS I NEVER DISPUTE AND HERE SHE BURST INTO TEARS
A MIND WITH A SPARK OF SENSIBILITY MORE THAN THIS WOMAN POSSESSED COULD NOT HAVE EQUIVOCATED WITH SUCH AN INTERROGATOR BUT HER REPLY WAS SHE WENT IN HER OWN DRESS MY LORD WAS IT A MAN'S OR A WOMAN'S ASKED HE WITH A LOOK OF THE SAME COMMAND
IF SHE HAD HEARD THE DIREST NEWS THAT EVER SOUNDED IN THE EARS OF THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE OF MORTALS THE AGITATION OF HER MIND AND PERSON COULD NOT HAVE BEEN STRONGER--SHE FELT WHILE EVERY WORD WAS SPEAKING A CHILL THROUGH ALL HER VEINS--A PLEASURE TOO EXQUISITE NOT TO BEAR ALONG WITH IT THE SENSATION OF EXQUISITE PAIN
FOR I HAVE SEEN--WHAT I MUST ALWAYS LOVE SANDFORD SIGHED AND LIFTED UP HIS HANDS
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN LORD ELMWOOD AND SANDFORD MET AT BREAKFAST THE LATTER WAS PALE WITH FEAR FOR THE SUCCESS OF LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER--THE EARL WAS PALE TOO BUT THERE WAS BESIDES UPON HIS FACE SOMETHING WHICH EVIDENTLY MARKED HE WAS DISPLEASED
CONSCIOUS OF THIS APPEARANCE AND CONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE FROM WHENCE IT AROSE IT WAS HER DESIRE TO HIDE HERSELF FROM THE ONLY OBJECT SHE COULD HAVE WISHED TO HAVE CHARMED
THE REFLECTION THAT STRUCK HIM FIRST WITH REMORSE AS HE SHUT THE DOOR UPON HIMSELF WAS:--"I HAVE DEPARTED FROM MY CHARACTER--FROM THE SACRED CHARACTER AND THE DIGNITY OF MY PROFESSION AND SENTIMENTS--I HAVE DEPARTED FROM MYSELF
AND WHEN LORD ELMWOOD ASKED HIM IN THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE IF HE DID NOT THINK HIS NEPHEW GREATLY IMPROVED HE LOOKED AT HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND MUTTERED HE COULD NOT SAY HE OBSERVED IT THE COLOUR HEIGHTENED IN MR RUSHBROOK'S FACE UPON THE OCCASION BUT HE WAS TOO WELL BRED NOT TO BE IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR
THACKERAY'S STYLE IS MERE ORNAMENT EXISTING INDEPENDENTLY OF WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
I AM AFRAID YOU DID NOT SEE HOW HE TREMBLED
G
G
G
G
G
G
THAT WILL BE OF NO AVAIL--I PRESENT HER BEFORE YOU AS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF MR MILNER
NOR MUST THEY CAVIL IF ON A NEARER VIEW THEY FIND IT LESS--BUT LET THEM CONSIDER THAT IF SHE HAD MORE FAULTS THAN GENERALLY BELONG TO OTHERS SHE HAD LIKEWISE MORE TEMPTATIONS
I HEAR HIM CALL YOU BY THE HARSHEST NAMES AND BEHOLD HIM FLY FROM YOUR SIGHT FOR EVER AS AN OBJECT OF HIS DETESTATION OH SPARE THE DREADFUL PICTURE.--FLY FROM MY SIGHT FOR EVER
I WILL NO LONGER THINK OF HIM YET COULD SHE HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM WITHOUT JOINING IN THE SAME IDEA MISS FENTON HER ANGUISH HAD BEEN SUPPORTABLE
IN CONSEQUENCE OF LADY MATILDA'S INDISPOSITION MADAM I HAVE VENTURED TO DELAY THIS NOTICE TILL MORNING.--I NEED NOT SAY WITH WHAT CONCERN I NOW GIVE IT OR MENTION TO YOU I BELIEVE WHAT IS FORFEITED
DO YOU SUSPECT YOU SHALL CHANGE YOUR SENTIMENTS WOMEN SOMETIMES DO BUT BEFORE THAT CHANGE CAN TAKE PLACE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WILL BE AT AN END
WITH THIS PARTY MISS MILNER ARRIVED AT HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND FOR NEAR SIX WEEKS ALL AROUND WAS THE PICTURE OF TRANQUILLITY
AND AS THAT HUSBAND I SOLEMNLY SWEAR."----HE WAS PROCEEDING WITH VIOLENCE
YET I CANNOT BUT LAMENT THAT I AM NOT AS WELL INFORMED AS YOU ARE
OR PERHAPS MORE ENDEARING THAN EVER AS IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD BEHELD HIM WITH HOPE
PERFECTLY WELL I THANK YOU RUSHBROOK AND HE LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CARRIAGE
AND AS I NOW DESPAIR OF ENTICING I WILL OBLIGE HIM TO IT--AT LEAST I'LL MAKE THE TRIAL AND KNOW MY FATE AT ONCE WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO INVITE LORD FREDERICK TO THE HOUSE AND ASK MY GUARDIAN'S CONSENT FOR OUR IMMEDIATE UNION
DID YOU SEE HIM
WHILST IN HIS LOOKS YOU BEHELD HIS THOUGHTS MOVING WITH HIS LIPS AND EVER COINCIDING WITH WHAT HE SAID
SHE FELT THE INDECORUM OF THE POSTURE HE HAD CONDESCENDED TO TAKE AND WAS SHOCKED
IN THE NEXT PLACE I KNOW THEY ARE SO TO HIS DAUGHTER UNACCUSTOMED TO BE ADDRESSED SO PLAINLY PARTICULARLY IN A CASE WHERE HIS HEART WAS INTERESTED HE NEVERTHELESS SUBMITTED WITH PATIENCE
SHE RAN OVER WITH HASTE THE ACCOUNT OF LORD ELMWOOD'S STATE OF HEALTH
BUT REPEATEDLY INDULGED THEY WERE PRACTISED BY CASUAL OCCURRENCES
AND AS IT WAS A FAVOUR WHICH HE HAD REFUSED TO THE REPEATED REQUESTS OF MANY OF HIS FRIENDS THE VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION WAS HEIGHTENED
AND HIS ENDEAVOURS TO INSINUATE HIMSELF INTO THE AFFECTIONS OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED MERELY BY NOT GIVING HER OFFENCE EITHER IN SPEAKING TO HER OR LOOKING AT HER FORMED A CHARACTER SO WHIMSICAL THAT IT FREQUENTLY FORCED A SMILE FROM MISS MILNER THOUGH HIS VERY NAME HAD OFTEN POWER TO THROW A GLOOM OVER HER FACE
PRAY AND HE HESITATED WAS SHE BURIED WITH HIM NO MY LORD--SHE EXPRESSED NO SUCH DESIRE
HOWEVER CONTINUED HE YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD THOUGH YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME IN YOUR'S THAT LORD FREDERICK'S LIFE IS SECURE
THE LEAST WONDERFUL CHANGE IS THE DEATH OF MRS HORTON
INDEED I THINK HE DOES AND HE LOOKED AT SANDFORD AS IF HE WAS DISPLEASED
AFTER A SHORT TIME--"YOU ALL APPEAR MELANCHOLY SAID MISS MILNER
SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS THE CAUSE OF HER BEING HURRIED TO THE ELECTION OF A LOVER BEFORE HER OWN MIND COULD WELL DIRECT HER WHERE TO FIX
MR SANDFORD WOULD NOT INVITE YOU IF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DISPLEASE LORD ELMWOOD NOT I REPLIED SANDFORD CHURLISHLY
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CRIED LORD ELMWOOD THAT YOU ARE IN THIS TERROR
YOUR LADYSHIP WAS AT BATH LAST SPRING--YOU KNOW THE YOUNG LADY TO WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF BEING APPOINTED GUARDIAN
UNDETERMINED HOW TO ACT UPON THIS TRIAL WHICH WAS TO DECIDE HIS FUTURE DESTINY RUSHBROOK SUFFERED SO POIGNANT AN UNCERTAINTY THAT HE BECAME AT LENGTH ILL AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THAT WAS ALLOTTED HIM FOR HIS REPLY HE WAS CONFINED TO HIS BED IN A HIGH FEVER
ON WHICH A DINNER A BALL AND SUPPER WAS GIVEN BY LORD ELMWOOD TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURING GENTRY--THE PEASANTS ALSO DINED IN THE PARK OFF A ROASTED BULLOCK SEVERAL CASKS OF ALE WERE DISTRIBUTED AND THE BELLS OF THE VILLAGE RUNG
AND WHY MR SANDFORD CRIED HE
WHEN THE ENGAGEMENT WAS OVER I WAS TOO IMPATIENT TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH HIS SAFETY TO THINK THEN ON GRATIFYING HIM
IF THE CONVERSATION DID NOT EVERY DAY TURN UPON THE SUBJECT OF LORD ELMWOOD'S DEPARTURE--A CONVERSATION HE EVIDENTLY AVOIDED HIMSELF--YET EVERY DAY SOME NEW PREPARATION FOR HIS JOURNEY STRUCK EITHER THE EAR OR THE EYE OF MISS MILNER--AND HAD SHE BEHELD A FRIGHTFUL SPECTRE SHE COULD NOT HAVE SHUDDERED WITH MORE HORROR THAN WHEN SHE UNEXPECTEDLY PASSED HIS LARGE TRUNKS IN THE HALL NAILED AND CORDED READY TO BE SENT OFF TO MEET HIM AT VENICE
FOR COULD AN ENEMY TO WHOM HE WOULD HAVE LISTENED HAVE WHISPERED TO SANDFORD AS HE LEFT LORD ELMWOOD CRUEL BARBAROUS MAN
YET HER LIFE IS NOT DEVOID OF INTEREST
CHAPTER IV
CHAPTER IV
CHAPTER IV
CHAPTER IV
AT LAST RISING BRISKLY AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO IN HASTE WHEN HE DID GO
MRS HORTON AFTER A LITTLE WHILE OBSERVED IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MORNING LORD ELMWOOD SAID HE THOUGHT HE HEARD IT RAIN IN THE NIGHT SANDFORD CRIED FOR HIS PART HE SLEPT TOO WELL TO KNOW AND THEN UNASKED HELD A PLATE WITH BISCUITS TO MISS MILNER--IT WAS THE FIRST CIVILITY HE HAD EVER IN HIS LIFE OFFERED HER
AND WITHOUT RELUCTANCE DRESSED HERSELF AS A WOOD-NYMPH TO ACCOMPANY HER FRIEND
HE HAD ONCE THOUGHT HER BEHAVIOUR IN THIS RESPECT WAS AMBIGUOUS BUT SINCE HER CONFESSION OF A PASSION FOR THAT NOBLEMAN HE HAD NO DOUBT BUT IN THE END SHE WOULD BECOME HIS WIFE
DINED WITH HIM AND RELATED AS HERETOFORE TO THE ATTENTIVE MATILDA ALL THAT PASSED
AND IN THE TIMOROUS EXPECTATION OF HIS COMING HER APPETITE DECLINED AND SHE LOST ALL HER COLOUR
AND AFTER THE MOST DELIBERATE AND DEEP REFLECTION HE CONCLUDED WITH THIS DECISIVE OPINION--HE HAD LOVED LADY MATILDA IN WHATEVER STATE IN WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES
AND HE IS A MAN OF SUCH NICE HONOUR THAT HE WILL NOT INDULGE YOU WITH ANY POWER BEFORE MARRIAGE TO WHICH HE DOES NOT INTEND TO SUBMIT HEREAFTER BUT TENDERNESS AFFECTION THE POLITENESS DUE FROM A LOVER TO HIS MISTRESS DEMANDS HIS SUBMISSION
HE ASKED FOR DORRIFORTH WENT HASTILY INTO HIS APARTMENT AND POURED UPON HIM A TORRENT OF REBUKES
FOR SHE HAD REFUSED BESIDES SIR EDWARD ASHTON MANY OTHERS OF EQUAL PRETENSIONS
THEREFORE SIR IF THAT IS THE REQUEST IT IS ALREADY ANSWERED
HER GUARDIAN THEN HANDED HER OUT OF THE APARTMENT INTO HER COACH WHICH WAS WAITING TO TAKE HER MISS WOODLEY AND HIMSELF HOME
A CHACE MY LORD--I BEG YOUR PARDON--BUT A PACK OF DOGS I UNEXPECTEDLY MET FOR IN THE HACKNIED ART OF LYING WITHOUT INJURY TO ANY ONE RUSHBROOK TO HIS SHAME WAS PROFICIENT
SHE FLED FROM THE PLACE AT HIS APPROACH
AND HER RETIREMENT WAS AT LAST COMPLETE
HE THEREFORE ONLY WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND CONCEALED HIS TEARS
BUT MORE THAN ALL THE THREATENING MANNER IN WHICH THIS RATIONAL AND APPARENTLY CONCILIATING SPEECH WAS UTTERED THE MENACES THE SEVERITY WHICH SAT UPON THE EARL'S COUNTENANCE WHILE HE DELIVERED THOSE MODERATE WORDS MIGHT HAVE INTIMIDATED A MAN WHOLLY INDEPENDENT AND LESS USED TO FEAR THAN HIS NEPHEW HAD BEEN
BUT THAT IS THE WAY--THE PERSON WHO IS OUR FRIEND WE DISTRUST--WHERE A COMMON INTEREST IS CONCERNED WE ARE ASHAMED OF DRAWING ON A COMMON DANGER--AFRAID OF ADVICE THOUGH THAT ADVICE IS TO SAVE US.----MISS WOODLEY SAID HE CHANGING HIS VOICE WITH EXCESS OF EARNESTNESS DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO MAKE MISS MILNER HAPPY ANY THING IN HONOUR MY LORD SHE CAN DESIRE NOTHING FARTHER HE REPLIED IN AGITATION
HOW MUCH DOES THE DIFFERENCE OF EXTERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THE MANNERS BUT EVEN THE PERSONS OF SOME PEOPLE
FAR FROM SEEMING TO RETAIN ANY RESENTMENT AGAINST HIS WARD FOR THE DANGER INTO WHICH HER IMPRUDENCE HAD LED HIM HE APPEARED RATHER TO PITY HER INDISCRETION AND TO WISH TO SOOTHE THE PERTURBATION WHICH THE RECOLLECTION OF HER OWN CONDUCT HAD EVIDENTLY RAISED IN HER MIND
DORRIFORTH ENTERED SOON AFTER IN A MUCH LESS GLOOMY HUMOUR THAN WHEN HE WENT OUT AND TOLD HIS RELATION THAT HE AND THE LADIES WOULD DINE WITH HIM THE NEXT DAY IF HE WAS DISENGAGED
IF IN EVERY OTHER INSTANCE MY CONDUCT HAS BEEN BLAMEABLE HE SHALL AT LEAST IN THIS ACKNOWLEDGE ITS MERIT
IF LORD ELMWOOD WAS NOT DESIROUS MISS MILNER SHOULD CONCLUDE HER VISIT AND RETURN TO HIS PROTECTION IT WAS PARTLY FROM THE MULTIPLICITY OF AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE WAS AT THIS TIME ENGAGED AND PARTLY FROM HAVING MR SANDFORD NOW ENTIRELY PLACED WITH HIM AS HIS CHAPLAIN
BUT SHE DID NOT OBSERVE OR SHE DID NOT FEEL HIS MOROSE TEMPER AS HERETOFORE--HE SEEMED AMIABLE MILD AND GENTLE
I ONLY MEANT TO CENSURE HER TASTE FOR STAYING AT HOME I THINK REPLIED MR SANDFORD A MUCH HEAVIER CENSURE SHOULD BE PASSED UPON THOSE WHO PREFER RAMBLING ABROAD BUT I HOPE LADIES MY NOT COMING SAID LORD ELMWOOD WAS NO INCONVENIENCE TO YOU
IT WAS A PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS DISPOSITION IN HIS INTENDED WIFE WHICH HAD GIVEN TO LORD ELMWOOD'S THOUGHTS ON MATRIMONY THE IDEA OF DREARY WINTER
AND THAT MANLY VOICE FALTERED AS MINE DOES SOMETIMES--HIS PROUD HEART WAS HUMBLED TOO AS MINE IS NOW AND THEN
BUT FINDING IT VAIN TO CONTEND SUBMITTED--NOT HOWEVER WITH A GOOD GRACE
AFTER LORD ELMWOOD HAD RETIRED INTO HIS CHAMBER IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE READ THE LETTER SANDFORD HAD GIVEN HIM
THESE IMPRESSIONS HOWEVER AND OTHERS OF FEAR AND ANXIETY WHICH HER FATHER'S ARRIVAL HAD EXCITED BY DEGREES WORE OFF
HE WAS NOW PERFECTLY WELL FROM HIS FALL AND RECEIVED HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS BUT OF COURSE NOT WITH THAT PECULIAR WARMTH WHICH HE HAD DISCOVERED WHEN HE RECEIVED HER JUST AFTER HIS ILLNESS
MY DEAR AUNT SHE CRIED TO MRS HORTON FOLLOW AND PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO GIVE UP HER DESIGN
WIVES AS THEY WERE AND MAIDS AS THEY ARE
ENTERING THE DRAWING-ROOM ONE EVENING HE STARTED ON SEEING LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY THERE IN EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH MISS MILNER
IN GOOD OR IN ILL HUMOUR
FOR HE THOUGHT IN A CASE LIKE THIS WHAT NATURE WOULD NOT OF HERSELF EFFECT NO ART NO ARGUMENTS OF HIS COULD ACCOMPLISH
FOR AS SOON AS MY LORD FREDERICK IS MADE ACQUAINTED WITH MISS MILNER'S CONFESSION ALL DIFFERENCES MUST BE RECONCILED WHAT CONFESSION ASKED LORD ELMWOOD
BUT NOT A WORD BESIDE
GONE OUT MY LORD SHE REPLIED
SANDFORD HAD ALSO TAKEN HIS PRECAUTIONS
I AM ENGAGED TO DINNER HE REPLIED
MISS MILNER IN LORD ELMWOOD'S DRAWING ROOM SURROUNDED BY LISTENERS BY ADMIRERS FOR EVEN HER ENEMIES COULD NOT LOOK AT HER WITHOUT ADMIRATION ANIMATED WITH APPROBATION AND APPLAUSE--AND MISS MILNER WITH NO GIDDY OBSERVER TO GIVE HER ACTIONS A FALSE ECLAT DESTITUTE OF ALL BUT HER OWN UNDERSTANDING WHICH SECRETLY CONDEMNS HER UPON THE POINT OF RECEIVING CENSURE FROM HER GUARDIAN AND FRIEND ARE TWO DIFFERENT BEINGS
AND THIS WAS BUT NECESSARY AS HER WEAKNESS INCREASED
AND WHO HAPPIER IN THE MARRIED STATE THAN SOME KINGS LORD ELMWOOD DIRECTED HIS EYES TO THE SIDE OF THE TABLE OPPOSITE TO THAT WHERE MISS MILNER SAT
HE CANNOT BE OTHERWISE RETURNED MATILDA IF HE IS A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING HE DOES NOT WANT UNDERSTANDING NEITHER REPLIED SANDFORD
HAPPY WOMAN EXCLAIMED MISS MILNER OF MISS FENTON
HE AFTER CONSIDERATION GAVE THEM FOUR DAYS
AND HE SHALL BE CONVINCED THAT THE WOMAN OF WHOSE WEAKNESS HE HAS HAD SO MANY FATAL PROOFS IS YET IN POSSESSION OF SOME FORTITUDE--FORTITUDE TO BID HIM FAREWELL WITHOUT DISCOVERING ONE AFFECTED OR ONE REAL PANG THOUGH HER DEATH SHOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE THUS SHE RESOLVED AND THUS SHE ACTED
AND AS HE HAD BUT FEW SERVANTS HERE IT WAS A PLACE WHICH HE SUPPOSED WOULD BE LESS THE OBJECT OF SUSPICION IN THE PRESENT CASE THAN ANY OTHER OF HIS SEATS
SHE DARES NOT STAY ALL NIGHT AND YET AFTER GOING SAID SANDFORD IN DEFIANCE TO YOUR COMMANDS I SHOULD SUPPOSE SHE DARED SHE IS IN GOOD COMPANY AT LEAST MY LORD SAID MRS HORTON
AND WHEN SANDFORD JOINED THEM AT DINNER THE EARL WENT WITH HIS USUAL ALACRITY TO HIM AND AS WAS HIS CUSTOM AFTER ANY SEPARATION PUT OUT HIS HAND CHEERFULLY TO TAKE HIS
HE THEN ONCE MORE ASSURED HER LORD FREDERICK'S LIFE WAS SAFE AND WAS QUITTING THE ROOM--BUT WHEN HE RECOLLECTED IN WHAT HUMILIATION HE HAD LEFT HER TURNING TOWARDS HER AS HE OPENED THE DOOR HE ADDED AND BE ASSURED MADAM THAT MY ESTEEM FOR YOU SHALL BE THE SAME AS EVER SANDFORD AS HE FOLLOWED HIM BOWED AND REPEATED THE SAME WORDS--"AND MADAM BE ASSURED THAT MY ESTEEM FOR YOU SHALL BE THE SAME AS EVER CHAPTER XV
THEN SHE THOUGHT OF SOOTHING HIM
LORD ELMWOOD KNEW ON THE OTHER HAND THAT SANDFORD'S FAILING WAS TO THINK ILL OF MISS MILNER--HE PITIED HIM FOR IT AND HE PITIED HER FOR IT--AND IN ALL THE AGGRAVATION WHICH HIS REPRESENTATIONS GAVE TO HER REAL FOLLIES AFFECTION FOR THEM BOTH IN THE HEART OF DORRIFORTH STOOD BETWEEN THAT AND EVERY OTHER IMPRESSION
BUT SOON WITH HER OLD PERTINACITY SHE WAS BACK AT HER WORK SETTLING AT LAST IN LONDON AND BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE COVENT GARDEN COMPANY
AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO OFFER IN RECOMPENSE FOR YOUR DEFECTS IN QUALITIES LIKE THESE MY WEALTH REPLIED HE OPPOSED TO HER INDIGENCE SANDFORD SMILED AND ANSWERED DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT WEALTH CAN BE ESTEEMED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE YOU RESPECTABLE
ON BEING TOLD OF IT BY THE SERVANT HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE APARTMENT AND CRIED OH
IT IS THE PLEASURE OF BEING CONSPICUOUS WHICH MAKES RICHES DESIRABLE
IS LORD FREDERICK THE MAN YOU APPROVE FOR YOUR HUSBAND UPON THIS CLOSE INTERROGATION SHE DISCOVERED AN EMBARRASSMENT BEYOND ANY SHE HAD EVER YET BETRAYED AND FAINTLY REPLIED NO HE IS NOT YOUR WORDS TELL ME ONE THING ANSWERED DORRIFORTH BUT YOUR LOOKS DECLARE ANOTHER--WHICH AM I TO BELIEVE WHICH YOU PLEASE WAS HER ANSWER WHILE SHE DISCOVERED AN INSULTED DIGNITY THAT ASTONISHED WITHOUT CONVINCING HIM
SHE SMILED AT THE WHIMSICALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT SHE TOOK ONE IN RETURN FOR HIS ATTENTION
AND I THOUGHT YOU KNEW I WAS NOT
FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM IN VERY DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES WITH YOUR FATHER HAVE YOU INDEED CRIED MATILDA
DO NOT THINK I REPROVED YOU SAID SANDFORD
YET ONCE BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS NEPHEW RUSHBROOK CROSSED OVER A STILE INTO ANOTHER FIELD AND FOUND HIM SITTING BY THE SIDE OF A BANK HIS GUN LYING BY HIM AND HIMSELF LOST IN THOUGHT
IN THEIR RETIRED APARTMENTS THIS DAY PASSED AWAY NOT ONLY SOBERLY BUT ALMOST SILENTLY
AND ALL OF THEM BEING FIRMLY PERSUADED THIS LAST RECEPTION WOULD PUT AN END TO EVERY FURTHER INTRUSION FROM HIM THEY TREATED HIS PRETENSIONS AND HIMSELF WITH THE CONTEMPT THEY INSPIRED--BUT NOT WITH THE CAUTION THAT WAS REQUISITE
HE ONCE OR TWICE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES AS HE READ AND ONCE LAID THE LETTER DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES
HE THEN MOSTLY STOLE A VISIT TO LADY ELMWOOD.--ON THIS LAST VISIT HE STAID TO SEE HER BURIED
MR SANDFORD WAS WITH HIM AND THEY WERE BOTH COME FROM PASSING THE EVENING AT MR FENTON'S
WHICH YOUR PRESENT INCONSISTENCY OF CONDUCT WILL BUT TOO READILY CONFIRM YOU WOULD NOT PLUNGE ME INTO SO MUCH SHAME INTO SO MUCH ANGUISH CRIED SHE DISTRACTEDLY
29 RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT NOT RECEIVING A LETTER FROM MR INCHBALD
IN DEVOTING CERTAIN HOURS OF THE DAY TO STUDY WITH HIM OTHERS TO MUSIC RIDING AND SUCH AMUSEMENTS MATILDA'S TIME NEVER APPEARED TEDIOUS AT ELMWOOD CASTLE ALTHOUGH SHE RECEIVED AND PAID NO ONE VISIT--FOR IT WAS SOON DIVULGED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD UPON WHAT STIPULATION SHE RESIDED AT HER FATHER'S AND STUDIOUSLY INTIMATED THAT THE MOST PRUDENT AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR OF HER TRUE FRIENDS WOULD BE TO TAKE NO NOTICE WHATEVER THAT SHE LIVED AMONG THEM
THE SEVEREST JUDGE COULD NOT HAVE ARRAIGNED HER CONDUCT FROM THE DAY SHE RECEIVED LORD ELMWOOD'S LETTER TO THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE
MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS WILLING TO HOPE AS SHE WISHED BEGAN TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION
UNDER THIS CONSIDERATION I WISH ONCE MORE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS IN REGARD TO MATRIMONY AND TO HEAR THEM BEFORE ONE OF YOUR OWN SEX THAT I MAY FORM AN OPINION BY HER CONSTRUCTIONS TO ALL THIS SERIOUS ORATION MISS MILNER MADE NO OTHER REPLY THAN BY TURNING TO MR SANDFORD AND ASKING IF HE WAS THE PERSON OF HER OWN SEX TO WHOSE JUDGMENT HER GUARDIAN WAS TO SUBMIT HIS OWN MADAM CRIED SANDFORD ANGRILY YOU ARE COME HITHER UPON SERIOUS BUSINESS ANY BUSINESS MUST BE SERIOUS TO ME MR SANDFORD IN WHICH YOU ARE CONCERNED
PLUNGED HOWEVER TOO DEEP IN HIS PASSION TO EMERGE FROM IT IN HASTE HE MEANT STILL TO VISIT AND WAIT FOR A CHANGE TO HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HE WAS PEREMPTORILY DESIRED BY MR SANDFORD TO DESIST FROM EVER COMING AGAIN
WHEN THE WILL OF HER FATHER WAS MADE KNOWN TO MISS MILNER SHE SUBMITTED WITHOUT THE LEAST RELUCTANCE TO ALL HE HAD REQUIRED
BILLS AND DRAFTS CAME UPON HIM WITHOUT NUMBER WHILE THE ACCOUNT ON HER PART OF MONEY EXPENDED AMOUNTED CHIEFLY TO ARTICLES OF DRESS THAT SHE SOMETIMES NEVER WORE TOYS THAT WERE OUT OF FASHION BEFORE THEY WERE PAID FOR AND CHARITIES DIRECTED BY THE FORCE OF WHIM
I SEPARATE YOU CRIED HE
NOR SHALL I RETURN TO ENGLAND TILL AFTER A FEW YEARS ABSENCE
WHILE MISS MILNER FOLLOWED HIM AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND REPEATED HER THANKS FOR HIS PROTECTION
AFTER SOME MINUTES OF EXPECTATION THE DOOR OPENS AND HER GUARDIAN COMES IN;--SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED
MOREOVER THE SIN OF INFIDELITY IN THE MARRIED STATE IS NOT A LITTLE SOFTENED TO COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS BY ITS FREQUENCY
LORD ELMWOOD WAS A MAN WHO MADE FEW RESOLUTIONS--BUT THOSE WERE THE EFFECT OF DELIBERATION
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION HE FIRST EXPRESSED THE HIGH SATISFACTION THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM BY AT LENGTH REVEALING TO HIM THE REAL STATE OF HER MIND
HER MIND AT THAT TIME IMPRESSED WITH THE MOST POIGNANT SORROW FOR HIS LOSS MADE NO DISTINCTION OF HAPPINESS THAT WAS TO COME
AND EVEN THE FORMALITY OF AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF HIS EQUALS CARRIED ALONG WITH IT A TERROR OR AT LEAST A FATIGUE TO A RUSTIC BARON
THAT YOU HAVE STILL MY FRIENDSHIP MY ADMIRATION AND EVEN MY LOVE I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE EITHER MYSELF OR YOU BY DISAVOWING
IT WILL THEN,"--REPLIED SANDFORD EAGERLY
LAUGHED AT AN ACCIDENT THAT HAD BEFALLEN ONE OF HIS DOGS
THESE EARTHLY AFFECTIONS THAT BIND ME TO HER BY CUSTOM SYMPATHY OR WHAT I FONDLY CALL PARENTAL LOVE WOULD DIRECT ME TO STUDY HER PRESENT HAPPINESS AND LEAVE HER TO THE CARE OF THOSE WHOM SHE THINKS HER DEAREST FRIENDS
AND YET FOR THAT VERY REASON IT IS DELIGHTFUL AND COMES TO US CHARGED WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF EMOTION WHICH IS NONE THE LESS REAL FOR ITS ELABORATION
IN THIS MANNER LORD ELMWOOD WAS FORCED OUT OF THE APARTMENT AND THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT CONCLUDED
WEARIED OUT WITH HOPES WITH FEARS AND AT THE END WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND RAGE SHE SUNK AT ONCE INTO A DEEP SLUMBER

WHILE MISS WOODLEY AND SHE WERE UPON THIS CONVERSATION A NOTE CAME FROM RUSHBROOK TO MISS WOODLEY WHEREIN HE ENTREATED HE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO SEE HER
HE LEARNED FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE INN THAT A LORD WITH A FINE EQUIPAGE HAD VISITED AT THE FARM BUT WHO HE WAS OR FOR WHAT PURPOSE HE WENT NO ONE COULD INFORM HIM
DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISS MILNER ASKED HER FRIEND SEEING HER HOLD IT WITH HER HAND
CONSEQUENTLY RUSHBROOK WAS FOR THAT TIME MASTER OF THE HOUSE
YOU MUST ENDEAVOUR SAID MISS WOODLEY TO FEEL THE DISPOSITION YOU WISH TO MAKE APPEAR I WILL REPLIED SHE I WILL FEEL A PROPER PRIDE--AND A PROPER SCORN OF THIS TREATMENT AND SO DESIROUS WAS SHE TO ATTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THESE SENTIMENTS THAT SHE MADE THE STRONGEST EFFORTS TO CALM HER THOUGHTS IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE IT
IT IS HER NAY STOP WHERE YOU ARE CRIED SANDFORD
LADY MATILDA RESUMED RUSHBROOK IS AN OBJECT THAT WRESTS FROM ME THE ENJOYMENT OF EVERY BLESSING YOUR KINDNESS BESTOWS
THIS IS I SUPPOSE TO ENHANCE THE MERIT OF THE OBLIGATION--BUT I SHALL NOT ACCEPT YOUR ACQUIESCENCE ON THESE TERMS THEN IN DISPENSING WITH IT I HOPE FOR YOUR PARDON DO YOU SUPPOSE RUSHBROOK I CAN PARDON AN OFFENCE THE SOLE FOUNDATION OF WHICH ARISES FROM A SPIRIT OF DISOBEDIENCE?--FOR YOU HAVE DECLARED TO ME YOUR AFFECTIONS ARE DISENGAGED
EVERY FIELD HE PASSED BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO THE HOUSE ON WHICH HIS IMAGINATION WAS FIXED
FAREWELL DORRIFORTH--FAREWELL LORD ELMWOOD--AND BEFORE YOU THROW THIS LETTER FROM YOU WITH CONTEMPT OR ANGER CAST YOUR IMAGINATION INTO THE GRAVE WHERE I AM LYING
HER LIPS COULD NOT UTTER A SENTENCE
DORRIFORTH THE GRAVE THE PIOUS THE ANCHORITE DORRIFORTH BY THEIR FORCE IS ANIMATED TO ALL THE ARDOUR OF THE MOST IMPASSIONED LOVER--WHILE THE PROUD PRIEST THE AUSTERE GUARDIAN IS HUMBLED IF I BUT FROWN INTO THE VERIEST SLAVE OF LOVE
AND NOW HAVING MADE A PREFACE TO EXCUSE YOU SHOULD YOU ONCE MORE REFUSE MINE I SHALL VENTURE TO GIVE IT MY LORD I HAVE NEVER YET REFUSED TO FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE BUT WHERE MY OWN PEACE OF MIND WAS SO NEARLY CONCERNED AS TO HAVE MADE ME CULPABLE HAD I COMPLIED WELL MADAM I SUBMIT TO YOUR DETERMINATIONS
BUT KNOW MR SANDFORD THAT I WILL NOT SUFFER THIS MUCH LONGER
A LOVING AND BELOVED BRIDE
HE SPOKE OF HER IN HER PRESENCE AS OF AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SOMETIMES FORGETTING EVEN TO NAME HER WHEN THE SUBJECT REQUIRED IT
AND THOUGH I AM NOT USED TO SIT UP ALL NIGHT ALL NIGHT REPEATED LORD ELMWOOD
WITH ONE OF THOSE INTERESTING LOOKS WHICH REVEALED THE ANXIETY OF HIS HEART AND YET WITH THAT GRACEFUL RESTRAINT OF ALL GESTICULATION FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE EVEN IN HIS MOST ANXIOUS CONCERNS HE ADDRESSED LADY EVANS WHO HAD CALLED ON MRS HORTON TO HEAR AND TO REQUEST THE NEWS OF THE DAY
WHAT HAVE I SAID CRIED SHE
AND THE DISPOSITION WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO TAKE HIS WARD'S PART WAS LIKELY IN THE END TO PROVE UNFAVOURABLE TO HER
I SHALL BE OVERJOYED TO SEE HER MY LORD--AND TO SEE MR SANDFORD--AND EVEN MR RUSHBROOK DO YOU KNOW HIM SAID LORD ELMWOOD
SHE WHO HAD NEVER BEEN BEYOND THE DREARY RUINOUS PLACES WHICH HER DECEASED MOTHER HAD MADE HER RESIDENCE WAS NATURALLY STRUCK WITH AMAZEMENT AND DELIGHT AT THE GRANDEUR OF A SEAT WHICH TRAVELLERS CAME FOR MILES TO SEE NOR THOUGHT THEIR TIME MISPENT
CHAPTER XVI
SHE DREW A CHAIR AND SAT AT THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF HER DELIGHTED FRIEND
DID I EVER PRETEND THAT I HAD AN ESTEEM FOR YOU THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECEIT MADAM BUT MERELY GOOD MANNERS I NEVER MR SANDFORD SACRIFICED TRUTH TO POLITENESS EXCEPT WHEN THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND YOU THOUGHT IT POLITENESS TO APPEAR SATISFIED AND I WAS SATISFIED TILL I RECOLLECTED THAT YOU MIGHT PROBABLY BE OF THE PARTY--THEN EVERY GROVE WAS CHANGED INTO A WILDERNESS EVERY RIVULET INTO A STAGNATED POOL AND EVERY SINGING BIRD INTO A CROAKING RAVEN A VERY POETICAL DESCRIPTION RETURNED HE CALMLY
MRS HORTON AND MISS WOODLEY WERE BOTH INDEED PRESENT AND LORD FREDERICK WAS TALKING IN AN AUDIBLE VOICE UPON SOME INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS
FILLED WITH THESE THOUGHTS ALL THE TIME OF DINNER HE COULD SCARCE LOOK AT HIS COMPANION WITHOUT TEARS OF GRATITUDE
AND I SHOULD CONCEIVE THE SAME AGAINST ANY OTHER MAN WHERE THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED
THAT IS A HABIT CONTINUED SHE WHICH COVERS A MULTITUDE OF FAULTS--AND FOR THAT EVENING I MAY HAVE THE CHANCE OF MAKING A CONQUEST EVEN OF YOU--NAY I QUESTION NOT IF UNDER THAT INVITING ATTIRE EVEN THE PIOUS MR SANDFORD WOULD NOT OGLE ME HUSH SAID MISS WOODLEY
UNTHINKING WOMAN
BUT YET HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY--THE SUBSEQUENT HUMILITY OF RUSHBROOK HAD TAKEN FROM THE INDISCRETION OF HER SPEAKING TO HIM AND THE EVENT COULD BY NO MEANS JUSTIFY HIS CENSURE
CONVINCED NOW THAT HIS NEPHEW HAD SOMETHING ON HIS MIND WHICH HE FEARED TO REVEAL THE EARL NO LONGER DOUBTED BUT THAT SOME YOUTHFUL ATTACHMENT HAD ARMED HIM AGAINST ANY MARRIAGE HE SHOULD PROPOSE
CONSTANTLY ON THE VERGE OF DISOBEYING MY COMMANDS THAT YOU MAY RECEDE AND GAIN MY GOOD WILL BY YOUR FORBEARANCE
HE DID NOT PROCEED BUT TAKING UP THE LETTER QUICKLY WITH A KIND OF EFFORT IN MAKING THE RESOLUTION BROKE IT OPEN
HE WALKED AGAIN
AND NOW WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE THOUSAND EXHORTATIONS THAT SPOKE IN EVERY FEATURE OF MISS WOODLEY SHE FLEW TO A LOOKING-GLASS TO ADJUST HER DRESS IN A MANNER THAT SHE THOUGHT MOST ENCHANTING
YET THAT PASSION WHICH HAD UNHAPPILY TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER WHOLE SOUL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INSPIRED HAD THERE NOT SUBSISTED AN EARLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SYSTEMS OF DIVINE FAITH
OR SHOULD I HAVE FELT THAT SYMPATHETIC TENDERNESS WHICH NOW PREYS UPON MY HEALTH HAD NOT HER MISFORTUNES EXCITED IT
THE DAUGHTER PERCEIVING THESE INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS HAS HER WHOLE FACE CONVULSED WITH GRIEF
ALL THE SUITE OF A NOBLEMAN
LORD ELMWOOD THEN TURNED TO SANDFORD AND SAID NAY MR SANDFORD YOU NEED ENTERTAIN NO DOUBTS OF ME--I HAVE JUDGED AND HAVE DETER HE WAS GOING TO SAY DETERMINED
SHE KNOWS SHE REFLECTS UPON THIS
SHE FOUND LORD ELMWOOD THERE IN HIS TRAVELLING DRESS STANDING PENSIVELY BY THE FIRE-PLACE--AND AS HE DID NOT DREAM OF SEEING HER HE STARTED WHEN SHE ENTERED AND WITH AN APPEARANCE OF ALARM SAID DEAR MISS WOODLEY WHAT'S THE MATTER SHE REPLIED NOTHING MY LORD
ITS CROWD AND BUSTLE FATIGUED HER--ITS FREEDOM OFFENDED HER DELICACY--AND THOUGH SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS THE FIRST OBJECT OF ADMIRATION IN THE PLACE YET THERE WAS ONE PERSON STILL WANTING TO ADMIRE
AFTER SHE HAD SAT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR CONVERSING WITH THEM ALL THOUGH BUT VERY LITTLE WITH THE LATTER LORD ELMWOOD WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM UPON SOME BUSINESS
YOU MAKE NO ANSWER SIR SAID LORD ELMWOOD AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS FOR HIS REPLY
FOR THEY WERE ASHAMED TO OWN A PARTIALITY IN HIS FAVOUR AND WERE TOO JUST TO BRING ANY ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM
SHE HAD FROM THE FIRST CHERISHED HER PASSION WITHOUT THE MOST REMOTE PROSPECT OF A RETURN--SHE WAS PREPARED TO SEE DORRIFORTH WITHOUT EVER SEEING HIM MORE NEARLY CONNECTED TO HER THAN AS HER GUARDIAN AND FRIEND
FOR THOUGH LORD ELMWOOD HAD ASSURED THE UNCLE OF LORD FREDERICK WHO ONCE WAITED UPON HIM ON THE SUBJECT OF MISS MILNER THAT ALL RESENTMENT WAS ON HIS PART ENTIRELY AT AN END
IN THE BITTEREST ANGUISH SHE FLEW TO PAY HER LAST DUTY TO HIS REMAINS AND PERFORMED IT WITH THE TRUEST FILIAL LOVE WHILE DORRIFORTH UPON IMPORTANT BUSINESS WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO TOWN
ONE MORNING AS SHE SAT TALKING TO LADY LUNEHAM ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS BUT THINKING ALONE ON HIM SIR HARRY LUNEHAM WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN A MR FLEETMOND CAME IN AND THE CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THE IMPROBABILITY DURING THE PRESENT LORD ELMWOOD'S YOUTH THAT HE SHOULD EVER INHERIT THE TITLE AND ESTATE WHICH HAD NOW FALLEN TO HIM--AND SAID MR FLEETMOND INDEPENDENT OF RANK AND FORTUNE IT MUST BE MATTER OF INFINITE JOY TO MR DORRIFORTH NO ANSWERED SIR HARRY INDEPENDENT OF RANK AND FORTUNE IT MUST BE A MOTIVE OF CONCERN TO HIM
SHE DID NOT GO INTO THE COFFEE-ROOM THOUGH REPEATEDLY URGED BY MISS WOODLEY BUT WAITED AT THE DOOR TILL HER CARRIAGE DREW UP
FOR THAT PURPOSE SHE DID NOT BREAKFAST IN HER OWN ROOM AS SHE HAD DONE FOR SEVERAL MORNINGS BEFORE BUT WENT INTO THE BREAKFAST-ROOM WHERE ALL THE FAMILY IN GENERAL MET
MATILDA LISTENED WITH DELIGHT TO THE RECITAL MISS WOODLEY GAVE ON HER RETURN AND MANY TIMES WHILE IT LASTED EXCLAIMED SHE WAS HAPPY BUT POOR MATILDA'S SUDDEN TRANSPORTS OF JOY WHICH SHE TERMED HAPPINESS WERE NOT MADE FOR LONG CONTINUANCE
THE COMFORT WAS A LETTER FROM MISS WOODLEY--A LETTER IN WHICH THE SUBJECT OF HER LOVE WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY BE MENTIONED AND IN WHATEVER TERMS IT WOULD STILL BE THE MEANS OF DELIGHT
THEY OCCASIONALLY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER THROUGH THE EVENING BUT THE SUBJECTS WERE GENERAL--AND THOUGH THEIR MANNERS EVERY TIME THEY SPOKE WERE PERFECTLY POLITE THEY WERE NOT MARKED WITH THE SMALLEST DEGREE OF FAMILIARITY
BY TURNS FEELING THE KEENEST EMOTIONS FROM HOPE AND FROM DESPAIR
A LAUGH OF RIDICULE WAS THE ONLY ANSWER
SHE WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD WHEN HER FATHER WENT ABROAD AND REMEMBERED SOMETHING OF BIDDING HIM FAREWELL
YET FOR A SHORT INTERVAL HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM OR TO REMAIN IN IT
BECAME AS A MISTRESS SOMETIMES HAUGHTY AND TO OPPOSITION ALWAYS INSOLENT
WHAT FOR MR SANDFORD CRIED MATILDA--FOR SANDFORD WHO WAS NOT A MAN THAT REPEATED LITTLE INCIDENTS HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR QUARREL
THOUGH INDEED THAT IS BUT THREE MONTHS AGO AND SHE CAN'T BE MUCH OLDER NOW SHE IS EIGHTEEN ANSWERED DORRIFORTH COLOURING WITH REGRET AT THE DOUBTS WHICH THIS LADY HAD INCREASED BUT NOT INSPIRED
HE WHOM YOU LEFT ILL WHEN YOU CAME HITHER IS DEAD AND WHO IS THE PRESENT LORD ELMWOOD SHE ASKED
BUT HE FOUND THAT HE HAD PROCEEDED TOO FAR TO BE ANY LONGER MASTER OF HIMSELF
HE LAMENTED TO FIND HIMSELF MISTAKEN AND THOUGHT IT PROPER NOW TO CONDEMN HER CAPRICE NOT MERELY IN WORDS BUT IN THE GENERAL TENOR OF HIS BEHAVIOUR
SHE WAS A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN ABSOLUTELY ALONE AND ASTONISHINGLY ATTRACTIVE--"TALL WE ARE TOLD SLENDER STRAIGHT OF THE PUREST COMPLEXION AND MOST BEAUTIFUL FEATURES
PSHAW CONTINUED RUSHBROOK I WANT A COMPANION
SANDFORD ROSE SLOWLY FROM HIS SEAT TO EXECUTE THE OFFICE
SHE CAME HOME AFTER HE HAD RETIRED IN GREAT SPIRITS
IN NATURE AND ART HER ATTEMPTS AT SOCIAL SATIRE ARE SUPERFICIAL AND OVERSTRAINED
LORD ELMWOOD IN HIS TURN BECAME NOT EMBARRASSED BUT ABSENT AND MELANCHOLY
NOW STUPIFIED AND NOW DISTRACTED SHE WALKED ABOUT THE HOUSE INCESSANTLY BEGGING FOR INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACT OR HOW TO FORGET HER MISERY
SHE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO BRISTOL TO SCOTLAND TO LIVERPOOL TO BIRMINGHAM APPEARING IN A GREAT VARIETY OF ROLES BUT NEVER WITH ANY VERY CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS
AND THE CONVERSATION FALLING OF COURSE UPON THE NOBLEMAN WHO HAD JUST TAKEN HIS LEAVE SANDFORD UNWARILY EXCLAIMED I WISH RUSHBROOK HAD BEEN HERE WHO CRIED LADY MATILDA
BUT HE PRESSED HIS SERVICES SO VIOLENTLY AND MY LADY EVANS IN WHOSE COACH I WAS WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED PRESSED ME SO VIOLENTLY TO ACCEPT THEM THAT HE CANNOT EXPECT ANY FARTHER MEANING FROM THIS ACQUIESCENCE THAN MY OWN CONVENIENCE MISS WOODLEY WAS GOING TO REPLY WHEN SHE RESUMED NAY IF YOU INTEND TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG STILL I AM NOT SORRY FOR IT WHEN IT HAS GIVEN ME SUCH CONVINCING PROOFS OF LORD ELMWOOD'S LOVE
AND TO MR DORRIFORTH HE CONCEIVED A GREATER DISLIKE THAN EVER
I AM NOT ONLY PROPER FROM CHARACTER BUT FROM CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE RELIED UPON--MY INTEREST IS SO NEARLY CONNECTED WITH THE INTEREST AND MY HAPPINESS WITH THE HAPPINESS OF MY WARD THAT THOSE PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS MY HONOUR WOULD PROTECT HER AGAINST EVERY PERIL ARISING FROM MY BEING TRUSTED OH
TO HIS WIDOW THE WEEK THAT FOLLOWED WAS ONE OF GRIEF HORROR AND ALMOST DESPAIR
AND THAT GALLANT YOUNG NOBLEMAN DECLARED--"MR SANDFORD HAD USED HIM ILL IN NOT PERMITTING HIM TO ACCOMPANY HIS RELATION
YET PRESERVED THE CONSTANCY NOT TO SHRINK FROM HER RESOLUTION OF SUBMITTING
NO SOONER HAD MISS WOODLEY ENTERED THE ROOM AND DORRIFORTH HAD RESIGNED TO HER THE CARE OF HIS WARD THAN HE FLEW TO THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LEFT LORD FREDERICK NEGLIGENT OF WHAT MIGHT BE THE EVENT IF HE STILL REMAINED THERE
HE THEN TURNED TO LORD ELMWOOD TO SEE IF HE WAS OBSERVING HER APPEARANCE--HE WAS NOT--AND SO MUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS ENGAGED ON HIM ALONE THAT SHE DID NOT ONCE PERCEIVE SANDFORD GAZING AT HER
VAIN ALL HER CARE TO DECORATE THAT BEAUTY
FOR A WHILE BLINDED BY HIS PASSION LORD ELMWOOD ENCOURAGED AND ADMIRED EVERY NEW PROOF OF HER RESTORED HAPPINESS
HER EXTREME HER EXCESS OF JOY ON SUCH A MEETING AND FROM SUCH ANGUISH RESCUED WAS IN PART REPRESSED BY HIS AWFUL PRESENCE
AND THUS SHE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS WHILE LORD ELMWOOD NOW AT THE DOOR BOWED ONCE MORE TO ALL THE COMPANY AND RETIRED
DORRIFORTH BEHELD THIS GROWING INTIMACY WITH ALTERNATE PAIN AND PLEASURE--HE WISHED TO SEE MISS MILNER MARRIED TO SEE HIS CHARGE IN THE PROTECTION OF ANOTHER RATHER THAN OF HIMSELF
LORD ELMWOOD APPEARED AT DINNER IN AN EVEN BUT NOT IN A GOOD TEMPER
I'LL APPEAL TO MISS FENTON AND MISS WOODLEY AND YET I BELIEVE REPLIED SHE WITH A SMILE I BELIEVE THEORY MUST ONLY BE THE JUDGE EVEN THERE THEN FROM ALL YOU HAVE SAID MADAM ON THIS OCCASION I AM TO CONCLUDE THAT YOU STILL REFUSE TO MARRY LORD FREDERICK YOU ARE AND YOU SUBMIT NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN I DO ALL YOU THEN SAID TO ME YESTERDAY WAS FALSE I WAS NOT MISTRESS OF MYSELF AT THE TIME THEREFORE IT WAS TRUTH!--FOR SHAME FOR SHAME AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND MR SANDFORD WALKED IN--HE STARTED BACK ON SEEING MISS MILNER AND WAS GOING AWAY
MUCH LESS WOULD I TAKE ANY UNFAIR MEANS TO BE INFORMED OF THEM
SHE LITTLE FORESAW AT THAT TIME HIS INGRATITUDE AND ITS EFFECTS VERY TRUE SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A HEAVY SIGH
THE BEAUTIFUL THE BELOVED MISS MILNER--SHE IS NO LONGER BEAUTIFUL--NO LONGER BELOVED--NO LONGER--TREMBLE WHILE YOU READ IT!--NO LONGER--VIRTUOUS
CHAPTER VII
CHAPTER VII
CHAPTER VII
ON SUCH AN OCCASION I COULD NOT SURVIVE THE DEATH OF EITHER FOR MY PART HE REPLIED I LOOK UPON MY LIFE AS MUCH FORFEITED TO MY LORD FREDERICK TO WHOM I HAVE GIVEN A HIGH OFFENCE AS IT MIGHT IN OTHER INSTANCES HAVE BEEN FORFEITED TO THE OFFENDED LAWS OF THE LAND
SHE GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT!--SHE REFLECTED WITH STILL MORE
BUT WITH THAT IMPRESSIVE MANNER IN WHICH A MAN NEVER FAILS TO SPEAK TO THE WOMAN HE LOVES BE THE SUBJECT WHAT IT MAY
MISS MILNER OBSERVED BUT OBSERVED WITH INDIFFERENCE THE SENSATIONS OF BOTH--THERE WAS BUT ONE PASSION WHICH THEN HELD A PLACE IN HER BOSOM AND THAT WAS VANITY
YET SO WELL HAD IT BEEN ACTED THAT HE DID NOT FOR AN INSTANT DOUBT ITS TRUTH
ON WHICH SANDFORD TOOK THEM OUT OF HER HAND SAYING PERHAPS YOU HAD RATHER HAVE COFFEE HER LIPS MOVED BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID
AND SHE FETCHED A SIGH IN ANXIOUS EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD CONSENT
ALL AGITATION AND EMOTION SHE IMPLORED HIM TO RISE AND WITH A THOUSAND PROTESTATIONS DECLARED THAT SHE THOUGHT THE RASHNESS OF THE ACTION WAS THE HIGHEST PROOF OF HIS REGARD FOR HER MISS WOODLEY NOW ENTERED
I WISH TO PROVE MY FRIENDSHIP TO MISS MILNER BUT SHE WILL NOT SUFFER ME--AND EVERY STEP THAT I TAKE FOR HER HAPPINESS I TAKE IN THE MOST PERPLEXING UNCERTAINTY MISS WOODLEY SIGHED--BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK
DURING THE WHOLE DAY THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF LADY ELMWOOD OR OF HER CHILD WAS CAUTIOUSLY AVOIDED--AND NOT TILL THE EVENING AFTER SANDFORD HAD RISEN TO RETIRE AND HAD WISHED LORD ELMWOOD GOOD NIGHT DID HE DARE TO MENTION THE SUBJECT
LORD MARGRAVE GLAD OF AN OPPORTUNITY THAT MIGHT APOLOGIZE FOR HIS INTRUSION UPON LADY MATILDA WENT WITH EAGERNESS TO HER APARTMENT AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET CONJURED HER IF SHE WOULD SAVE HIS LIFE AS WELL AS HER OWN TO SUBMIT TO BE CONSOLED
TIME STOLE AWAY AND THE TIME OF GOING TO HER GUARDIAN ARRIVED
SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE BUT WITH STILL MORE OF DIGNITY
THOUGH I AM SURE MR SANDFORD IMAGINED HE THOUGHT OF YOU FOR I SAW A SMILE OVER HIS WHOLE FACE IMMEDIATELY DID YOU MISS WOODLEY YES
DURING ALL THOSE HOLIDAYS SHE WAS UNUSUALLY MELANCHOLY BUT SUNK INTO THE DEEPEST DEJECTION WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THE DAY WAS FIXED ON WHICH HER FATHER WAS TO RETURN TO TOWN
AND SHE BLESSED HEAVEN REPEATEDLY FOR THE SINGULAR FAVOUR OF SHEWING TO HER CLEARLY BY THIS ACCIDENT HIS NEGLIGENCE OF HER SORROWS HIS TOTAL INDIFFERENCE
TO BEGIN WITH THE FIRST FEMALE OBJECT OF THIS STORY
CHAPTER XII
CHAPTER XII
CHAPTER XII
CHAPTER XII
HE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED BY THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS WARD TO REPLY TO SANDFORD
HERE WAS A PARTING NEARLY AS AFFECTING AS THAT BETWEEN HER AND HER GUARDIAN
BUT HE HAD A SECOND CONCERN WHICH WAS THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER TO CONCEAL HOW MUCH HE WAS AFFECTED
HE HAD NEVERTHELESS HIS WHOLE MIND FIXED UPON LADY MATILDA AND HAD PLACED SPIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO INFORM HIM OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE RELATING TO HER SITUATION
MISS FENTON IS ITS OBJECT--HER FORTUNE IS INFERIOR TO YOUR'S HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE LESS HERE THE POWERFUL GLOW OF JOY AND OF GRATITUDE FOR AN OPINION SO NEGLIGENTLY AND YET SO SINCERELY EXPRESSED FLEW TO MISS MILNER'S FACE NECK AND EVEN TO HER HANDS AND FINGERS
AND IN THE NAME OF GOD AND YOUR OWN HAPPINESS SINCE THIS IS THE STATE OF YOU BOTH LET ME PUT IT OUT OF YOUR POWER TO PART LORD ELMWOOD GAZED AT HIM WITH WONDER
I WAS ONLY CAUTIONING YOUR FRIEND NOT TO MAKE LIGHT OF THOSE VIRTUES WHICH IT WOULD DO HER HONOUR TO POSSESS
MISS WOODLEY UNEASY AT HER FRIEND'S BEING THUS FORCED TO GIVE AN OPINION UPON SO DELICATE A SUBJECT ENDEAVOURED TO SATISFY THE GENTLEMAN BY ANSWERING TO THE QUESTION HERSELF
SHE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND ONCE SIGHED HEAVILY
HE SAW HER COUNTENANCE CHANGE--HE LOOKED AT HER STEADFASTLY
FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST
IN SPITE OF HIS PRUDENCE HOWEVER AND HIS DELICACY TOWARDS MATILDA RUSHBROOK COULD NOT LET HIS VALET LEAVE HIM TILL HE HAD INQUIRED AND LEARNED ALL THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
RUSHBROOK THEN RANG FOR HIS SERVANT AND DESIRED HIM TO LOOK FOR THE BOOK ASKING HIM ANGRILY WHO HAD BEEN IN THE APARTMENT
SANDFORD SAID HOW DO YOU DO MY LORD CHEERFULLY IN RETURN
MATILDA WAS ONCE MORE AT LARGE
HE REFUSED TO SHELTER HIMSELF FROM THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE LAYMAN BY THE WALLS OF A CLOISTER BUT SOUGHT FOR AND FOUND THAT SHELTER IN THE CENTRE OF LONDON WHERE HE DWELT IN HIS OWN PRUDENCE JUSTICE FORTITUDE AND TEMPERANCE
THE LIST HAS FORTUNATELY SURVIVED AND SOME OF THE LATER ENTRIES ARE AS FOLLOWS 1791
SHE WAS HALF INCLINED TO MENTION HER TO HIM AND WAS DEBATING IN HER MIND WHETHER SHE SHOULD OR NOT WHEN MR SANDFORD CAME INTO THE ROOM SAYING AS HE ENTERED FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MY LORD WHERE DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT WHY DO YOU ASK SAID HE
HE WISHED IN VAIN--LORD ELMWOOD'S EYES FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR EXPRESSIVE OF REJOICING AT HIS ABSENCE
YOU MAY WISH TO HEAR OF LORD ELMWOOD'S HEALTH AND OF WHAT CHANGES MAY TAKE PLACE IN HIS RESOLUTIONS.--WILL YOU PERMIT ME AT THAT MOMENT A SERVANT CAME AND SAID SIR MY LORD IS IN THE CARRIAGE AND WAITING FOR YOU HE HASTENED AWAY AND MISS WOODLEY WAS RELIEVED FROM THE PAIN OF GIVING HIM A DENIAL
AND BY A HAPPY TALENT OF RIDICULE IN WANT OF OTHER WEAPONS FOR THIS WARFARE SHE THREW IN THE WAY OF THE HOLY FATHER AS GREAT TRIALS OF HIS PATIENCE AS ANY THAT HIS ORDER COULD HAVE SUBSTITUTED IN PENANCE
MY LORD DID YOU KNOW SOME OF THEM I AM AFRAID YOU WOULD THINK THEM UNPARDONABLE THIS WAS SO MUCH TO THE PURPOSE THAT MISS WOODLEY FOUND HERSELF ALARMED--BUT WITHOUT REASON--MISS MILNER LOVED TOO SINCERELY TO REVEAL IT TO THE OBJECT
AND FROM THE EXTREME DESIRE WHICH MR SANDFORD NOW MORE THAN EVER DISCOVERED OF DEPRECIATING HER IN HIS PATRON'S ESTEEM--FROM THE NOW MORE THAN COMMON ZEAL WHICH URGED HIM TO TAKE LORD ELMWOOD FROM HER COMPANY WHENEVER HE HAD IT IN HIS POWER SHE WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT WHILE HIS FRIEND ENTERTAINED SUCH STRONG FEARS OF HIS RELAPSING INTO LOVE SHE HAD REASON TO INDULGE THE STRONGEST HOPES THAT HE WOULD
AND THE TEARS WITHOUT ANY EFFORT EITHER TO IMPEL OR TO RESTRAIN THEM RAN DOWN HER FACE
MATILDA IMMEDIATELY ENTERED THE CHAMBER SHE HAD LEFT AND WITHOUT CASTING A SINGLE LOOK AT MISS WOODLEY BY WHICH SHE MIGHT GUESS OF THE OPINION SHE HAD FORMED OF MR RUSHBROOK'S CONDUCT
MISS MILNER WHOSE HEART WAS A RECEPTACLE FOR THE UNFORTUNATE NO SOONER WAS TOLD THE MELANCHOLY HISTORY OF MR AND MRS RUSHBROOK THE PARENTS OF THE CHILD THAN SHE LONGED TO BEHOLD THE INNOCENT INHERITOR OF HER GUARDIAN'S RESENTMENT AND TOOK MISS WOODLEY WITH HER TO SEE THE BOY
UPON THIS ACCOUNT HE ONCE THOUGHT OF ADVISING MR SANDFORD TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE ELSEWHERE
THE GOOD-NATURED MISS WOODLEY WAS OVERJOYED AT THE EXPECTATION OF THEIR NEW GUEST YET SHE HERSELF COULD NOT TELL WHY--BUT THE REASON WAS THAT HER KIND HEART WANTED A MORE AMPLE FIELD FOR ITS BENEVOLENCE
HER NAME DID NOT HOWEVER COME TO HIS RECOLLECTION--NOR ANY NAME BUT THIS--"MISS MILNER--DEAR MISS MILNER THAT SOUND DID NOT AWAKEN HER
FOR I HAVE SEEN WHAT TO AVOID BUT MINE HAVE BEEN THE MOST GRATIFYING REPLIED HE
DON'T I SAY SO REPLIED HE WARMLY
MISS FENTON WAS THOUGHT A PROPER MATCH FOR HIS COUSIN AND THAT SAME PROPRIETY HAS TRANSFERRED HER TO HIM IT WAS EASY TO CONVINCE MISS MILNER THAT ALL HER FRIEND SAID WAS TRUTH FOR SHE WISHED IT SO
AND YET SO LITTLE IS IT IN THE POWER OF THOSE WE DISLIKE TO DO ANY THING TO PLEASE US THAT FROM THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE SHE FORMED A MORE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF MR RUSHBROOK THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE
THIS APPEARED THE EFFECT OF SENTIMENTS WHICH HER BIRTH AND SITUATION INSPIRED JOINED TO A STUDIED MODE OF RESPECT BEST CALCULATED TO ENFORCE THE SAME FROM HER
EVERY ONE HAS HIS FAULT
HE EMBRACED HIS BRIDE WITH ALL THE TRANSPORT OF THE FONDEST HAPPIEST BRIDEGROOM AND IN RAPTURES CALLED HER BY THE ENDEARING NAME OF WIFE BUT STILL MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD YOU ARE ONLY MARRIED BY YOUR OWN CHURCH AND CONSCIENCE NOT BY YOUR WIFE'S OR BY THE LAW OF THE LAND
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CAUSE FOR YOUR EXULTATION WHICH YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO KNOW--IT IS THAT IN HIS SAFETY SHALL DWELL THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS WARD
BUT I HOPE YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME NOT EXPECT YOU MY LORD CRIED MISS MILNER
WITH THIS PLAN OF CONCEALMENT IN WHICH THE NATURAL MODESTY OF MISS MILNER ACQUIESCED THERE WAS BUT ONE EFFORT FOR WHICH THIS UNHAPPY WARD WAS NOT PREPARED
WHERE IS YOUR MISTRESS REPEATED HE IN A LOUDER VOICE THAN BEFORE
TO DIE WAS A HARD FATE FOR A YOUNG NOBLEMAN JUST IN POSSESSION OF HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND ON THE EVE OF MARRIAGE WITH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
LORD ELMWOOD DID NOT SEEM TO OBSERVE THIS AFFRONT--NOR WAS IT DONE AS AN AFFRONT--IT WAS MERELY WHAT POOR SANDFORD FELT
IT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED ME MISS WOODLEY REPLIED I WAS AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO;--WHEN WE MET FORMERLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE FIRST AND HE OUGHT NOW CRIED SANDFORD ANGRILY--AND THEN ADDED WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE IT IS CERTAINLY PROPER THAT THE SUPERIOR SHOULD BE THE FIRST WHO SPEAKS HE DID NOT LOOK AS IF HE THOUGHT HIMSELF OUR SUPERIOR REPLIED MATILDA
THIS WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL AND YET THIS SHE VENTURED UPON
HE IS DESIRED TO IMAGINE SEVENTEEN YEARS ELAPSED SINCE HE HAS SEEN OR HEARD OF ANY OF THOSE PERSONS WHO IN THE FOREGOING VOLUMES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIS ACQUAINTANCE--AND THEN SUPPOSING HIMSELF AT THE PERIOD OF THOSE SEVENTEEN YEARS FOLLOW THE SEQUEL OF THEIR HISTORY
DID HE SEND FOR ME WERE THE WORDS SHE UTTERED AS SOON AS SHE SAW HER
AT LENGTH HE ANSWERED IN A FAINT VOICE NO I BELIEVE I SHALL NOT DINE AT HOME WHERE IS YOUR LORDSHIP GOING TO DINE ASKED MRS HORTON
SHE THREW HER ARMS ABOUT HER FRIEND THE MOMENT THEY WERE LEFT ALONE AND ASKED WITH ANXIETY WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF HER BEHAVIOUR MISS WOODLEY WHO COULD NOT APPROVE OF THE DUPLICITY SHE HAD BETRAYED STILL WISHED TO RECONCILE HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HER OWN CONDUCT AND REPLIED SHE HIGHLY COMMENDED THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH SHE HAD AT LAST ACKNOWLEDGED HER SENTIMENTS FRANKNESS CRIED MISS MILNER STARTING
AND IS MY FATHER THE MASTER OF THIS HOUSE SHE CRIED--"AND WAS MY MOTHER ONCE THE MISTRESS OF THIS CASTLE HERE TEARS RELIEVED HER FROM A PART OF THAT BURTHEN WHICH WAS BEFORE INSUPPORTABLE
THIS WAS LORD FREDERICK LAWNLY THE YOUNGER SON OF A DUKE AND THE AVOWED FAVOURITE OF ALL THE MOST DISCERNING WOMEN OF TASTE
THE MISTAKE HOWEVER DID NOT FORCE FROM HIM HIS RESPECT
HIS TEMPER IS A GREAT DEAL ALTERED FROM WHAT IT ONCE WAS--HE RAISES HIS VOICE AND USES HARSH EXPRESSIONS UPON THE LEAST PROVOCATION--HIS EYES FLASH LIGHTNING AND HIS FACE IS DISTORTED WITH ANGER UPON THE SLIGHTEST MOTIVES--HE TURNS AWAY HIS OLD SERVANTS AT A MOMENT'S WARNING AND NO CONCESSION CAN MAKE THEIR PEACE
WHEN SHE DIED ASKED HE
AND YET WHETHER HIS FEAR SUGGESTED IT OR NOT SANDFORD THOUGHT HE APPEARED MORE COOL AND RESERVED WITH HIM THAN FORMERLY
MRS INCHBALD'S PLAYS ARE SO BAD THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THEY BROUGHT HER A FORTUNE
SO WEARISOME THAT WHICH WAS STILL TO COME
HE HAD BEEN ANGRY WITH HER HE HAD SHEWN HER THAT HE WAS AND HE NOW BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD NOT
III
AT WHAT HOUR AM I TO EXPECT HER HOME SAID HE
MR SANDFORD HAD BEEN THE FIRST WHO MADE OVERTURES TO HER ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD AND WAS THE FIRST SENT TO ASK HER TO DISPENSE WITH THE OBLIGATION.--SHE RECEIVED BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS WITH THE SAME INSIPID SMILE OF APPROBATION AND THE SAME COLD INDIFFERENCE AT THE HEART
HE WAS CHARMED TO FIND HER DISPOSITION SO TRACTABLE--PROPHESIED TO HIMSELF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF HIS GUARDIANSHIP AND HER ETERNAL AS WELL AS TEMPORAL HAPPINESS FROM THIS SPECIMEN
MISS MILNER'S PRIDE BEGAN TO BE ALARMED
OH MADAM CRIED SANDFORD HE IS GROWN A LIBERTINE NOW AND I WOULD NOT BELIEVE HIS WORD IF HE WERE TO GIVE IT YOU THEN SIR RETURNED DORRIFORTH ANGRILY YOU MAY BELIEVE MY WORD FOR I WILL KEEP THAT WHICH I GAVE TO YOU I WILL GIVE LORD FREDERICK ALL THE RESTITUTION IN MY POWER
REVIVED BY THESE CONJECTURES OF WHICH SOME WERE TRUE AND OTHERS FALSE
WHEN LORD ELMWOOD JOINED THEM HE WELCOMED THEM ALL SINCERELY
AND AS SHE COULD NOT LIKE HIM GOVERN HER ANGER IT FLUSHED IN HER FACE AND ALMOST FORCED HER INTO TEARS
WHO
SHE DID NOT HOWEVER ELOPE WITH HER PARAMOUR BUT ESCAPED TO SHELTER HERSELF IN THE MOST DREARY RETREAT
I WAS NEVER SO UNFIT TO BE LEFT WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP PERHAPS AT PRESENT YOU CAN DISPENSE WITH MINE SAID DORRIFORTH
AND SO THERE IS TO ME SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A SERIOUS FACE AND A HEARTFELT SIGH
AND ALL WITH A CARE AND WATCHFULNESS IN HIS LOOKS AS IF HE HAD BEEN A TENDER-HEARTED BOY AND SHE HIS DARLING BIRD THE LOSS OF WHICH WOULD EMBITTER ALL THE JOY OF HIS HOLIDAYS
BUT THE GREAT PLEASURE HE TOOK IN HIS SOCIETY JOINED TO THE BITTER MORTIFICATION HE KNEW SUCH A PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO HIS FRIEND WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO MAKE IT
SEPARATE THIS MOMENT CRIED SANDFORD OR RESOLVE TO BE SEPARATED ONLY BY--DEATH THE COMMANDING AND AWFUL MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE THIS SENTENCE MADE THEM BOTH TURN TO HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND AS IT WERE PETRIFIED WITH THE SENSATION HIS WORDS HAD CAUSED
BUT I THINK I FEEL MYSELF MORE ATTACHED TO THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT THAN EVER I DID IN MY LIFE YOU IMAGINE THEN MY FATHER THOUGHT OF ME WHEN HE SAID THIS CRIED MATILDA EAGERLY
