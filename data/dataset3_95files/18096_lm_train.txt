A RAILWAY PORTER SAYS TO HIS MATE AS THE TWO GAZE AT THE BACK OF THIS SMALL SWELL WITH HIS CANE AND TOP-HAT WHAT DOES HE SAY BILL WHY HE SAYS HE MUST HAVE A COMPARTMENT TO HISSELF BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET ON WITHOUT HIS SMOKE ANOTHER DRAWING IN A PUNCH OF 1861 POINTS THE SAME MORAL
TOBACCO AS HAS BEEN SAID WAS PRAISED AS WELL AS ABUSED EXTRAVAGANTLY
PARR PERSISTED BUT THE AUTHORITIES AT THE INN WERE FIRM IN THEIR REFUSAL TO ALLOW ANYTHING SO VULGAR AS SMOKING ON THEIR PREMISES WHEREUPON PARR IS SAID TO HAVE EXCLAIMED
ON THIS OCCASION THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE TIME
THE LATTER CARRIED THE DAY BUT THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF MEMBERS RUINED THE CLUB WHICH SOON AFTER CEASED TO EXIST

IN 1805 LAMB WROTE TO WORDSWORTH--"NOW I HAVE BID FAREWELL TO MY SWEET ENEMY TOBACCO
PLEASE YOU TO IMPART YOUR SMOKE VERY WILLINGLY SIR SAYS THE SMOKER
ONE OR TWO OF THEIR WRITERS ABUSED IT ROUNDLY
ABOUT THE TIME THAT LANG'S ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN SIR F.C
NOR DID HE PROBABLY FORESEE HOW SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE TASTE FOR SMOKING EVEN IN THE CIRCLES MOST INFLUENCED BY FASHION WOULD REVIVE
THE INDIANS WERE WISE IN THEIR GENERATION WHEN THEY MADE THE CIRCULATION OF THE PIPE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR POW-WOWS
SCOTT'S REMARK WAS THAT OF A CONTEMPORARY
I KEEP TO MY TOBACCO STILL AS YOU SAY
MAII 1651 IT
THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK ON TOBACCO PUBLISHED A FEW YEARS AGO WROTE--"DR JOHNSON SMOKED LIKE A FURNACE"--A GROTESQUELY UNTRUE STATEMENT--AND ALL HIS FRIENDS GOLDSMITH REYNOLDS GARRICK WERE HIS COMPANIONS IN TOBACCO-WORSHIP REYNOLDS WE KNOW WHEN THEY TALK'D OF THEIR RAPHAELS CORREGIOS AND STUFF HE SHIFTED HIS TRUMPET AND ONLY TOOK SNUFF JOHNSON AND ALL HIS COMPANY TOOK SNUFF AS EVERY ONE IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD AND A GREAT MANY OTHERS OUTSIDE THAT CHARMED CIRCLE DID
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT WILSON IN TELLING THE STORY OF HIS DISSIPATED EARLY LIFE CLASSES SMOKING WITH SINGING HOLLOAING WRANGLING DRINKING TOASTING AND OTHER DIVERSIONS OF JOLLY COMPANIONS THERE IS NO MENTION OF PARSON TRULLIBER'S PIPE BUT THAT PIG-BREEDER AND LOVER CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN A NON-SMOKER
BUT THE TRUTH OF THIS STATEMENT MAY WELL BE DOUBTED
IN THE THIRD CHAPTER FOKER HAS A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH AS HE STROLLS WITH PEN DOWN THE HIGH STREET OF CHATTERIS
HE ALSO QUOTES FROM THE ST DUNSTAN'S WARDMOTE REGISTER OF 1630 SEVERAL CASES OF COMPLAINT AGAINST UNLICENSED TRADERS AND OTHERS
I THINK THE DEVIL'S IN THE GOWN MUTTERED THE CURATE
WHEN HE AND THORNHILL AND THEIR THREE COMPANIONS SET OUT FROM GRAVESEND FOR THE FINAL STAGE UP THE RIVER OF THEIR FAMOUS FIVE DAYS PEREGRINATION WE ARE TOLD THAT THEY HIRED A BOAT WITH CLEAN STRAW AND LAID IN A BOTTLE OF WINE PIPES TOBACCO AND LIGHT AND SO CAME MERRILY UP THE RIVER
IN THE EARLY FORTIES HE ISSUED A GENERAL ORDER NO
THIS LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO JAMES GRANGER AND WAS PUBLISHED IN GRANGER'S CORRESPONDENCE
AND OFTEN WITH PIPES OF TOBACCO
MRS GARBUTT HAD BEEN TWICE MARRIED HER HUSBANDS HAVING BEEN SAILORS DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS
FORREST IN HIS BOOK ON THE INDIAN MUTINY TELLS HOW AT THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW AS THE MONTH OF AUGUST ADVANCED THE TEA AND SUGAR EXCEPT A SMALL STORE KEPT FOR INVALIDS WERE EXHAUSTED
A CLERGYMAN HAS PUT IT ON RECORD THAT WHEN HE WENT IN 1873 AS CURATE-IN-CHARGE TO AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY NORFOLK VILLAGE AT HIS FIRST EARLY CELEBRATION HE ARRIVED IN CHURCH ABOUT 7.45 A.M AND HE SAYS TO MY AMAZEMENT SAW FIVE OLD MEN SITTING ROUND THE STOVE IN THE NAVE WITH THEIR HATS ON SMOKING THEIR PIPES
PERHAPS THE MOST LIKELY SCENE OF RALEIGH'S FIRST EXPERIMENTS IN THE ART OF SMOKING WAS DURHAM HOUSE WHICH STOOD WHERE THE ADELPHI TERRACE AND THE STREETS BETWEEN IT AND THE STRAND NOW STAND
BUT IN THE DAYS WHEN TOBACCO-SMOKING FIRST CAME INTO VOGUE THE SIGNS CHOSEN NATURALLY HAD SOME REFERENCE TO THE TRADE THEY INDICATED AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST USED WAS THE SIGN OF THE BLACK BOY IN ALLUSION TO THE ASSOCIATION OF THE NEGRO WITH TOBACCO CULTIVATION
ONE OF THE FIRST SNUFF-BOXES WAS THE SO-CALLED RAPE OR GRIVOISE BOX AT THE BACK OF WHICH WAS A LITTLE SPACE FOR A PIECE OF THE ROOT WHILST A SMALL IRON RASP WAS CONTAINED IN THE MIDDLE
IT WAS ENTITLED A PLEA FOR THE PIPE
MR COX SAYS
6 IN
IT IS OF COURSE CONCEIVABLE THAT THE PROHIBITION SO FAR AS THE CHURCH AND TRINITY COLLEGE HALL WERE CONCERNED WAS AGAINST THE TAKING OF SNUFF RATHER THAN AGAINST SMOKING
THE DEFTLY HANDLED PINCH PLEASANTLY TITILLATED THEIR NERVES AND THE DEXTEROUS USE OF THE SNUFF-BOX MOREOVER COULD ALSO SERVE THE PURPOSES OF VANITY BY DISPLAYING THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS OF THE HAND AND THE SPLENDOUR OF THE RINGS UPON THE FINGERS
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS ORDERED
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS ADDICTED TO SELF-INDULGENCE LOVED GOOD EATING AND GOOD AND AMPLE DRINKING AND MOREOVER KEPT LATE HOURS A L'ANGLAISE SMOKED HIS PIPE AND DRANK OCEANS OF PUNCH COLERIDGE IN THE BIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA GIVES AN AMUSING ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE OF AN ATTEMPT TO SMOKE IN COMPANY WITH A PARTY OF TRADESMEN
MR HARRY FURNISS IN THE PREFACE TO HIS EDITION OF THACKERAY HAS AN ADMIRABLY TERSE AND PERTINENT PARAGRAPH ON THIS ASPECT OF THE FITZ-BOODLE PAPERS HE SAYS--"NO GENTLEMAN IN THOSE DAYS WAS SEEN SMOKING EVEN A WEED IN THE STREETS
BOSWELL TELLS US THAT ALTHOUGH THE SAGE HIMSELF NEVER SMOKED YET HE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF THE PRACTICE AS A SEDATIVE INFLUENCE
AND IT IS USUALLY ADDED THAT PIPES WERE NOT THEN INVENTED SO THEY SMOKED THE TWISTED LEAF OR CIGARS
SIMILARLY IN BRAMSTON'S MAN OF TASTE VARIOUS FASHIONABLE TASTES ARE DESCRIBED BUT THERE IS NO MENTION OF TOBACCO
THE FIRST AND ONLY IDEA IN WHICH I FOUND HIM LED ASTRAY BY AN ABSTRACT THEORY LATER HIS HOSTESS EXPLAINING TO HIM THE METHOD AND ROUTINE OF LIFE IN AN ENGLISH COUNTRY-HOUSE SAID THAT THE LADIES RETIRED ABOUT ELEVEN WHILE THE GENTLEMEN FINISHED THEIR DAY'S WORK IN THE SMOKING-ROOM--THE SECLUDED APARTMENT--OR ENJOYED A CIGAR AT THE BILLIARD-TABLE
VENNER GOES ON TO GIVE A TERRIBLE CATALOGUE OF THE ILLS THAT WILL BEFALL THE SMOKER WHO USES TOBACCO CONTRARY TO THE ORDER AND WAY I HAVE SET DOWN IT IS A DREADFUL LIST WHICH MAY POSSIBLY HAVE FRIGHTENED A FEW NERVOUS SMOKERS
INSIDE THERE IS A FLAT PIECE OF SHEET-LEAD WITH A KNOB TO KEEP THE TOBACCO PRESSED CLOSE SO THAT IT MAY NOT DRY UP
IN THE GARDEN OF THE YOUGHAL HOUSE BY THE WAY THEY USED TO SHOW THE TREE--PERHAPS STILL DO SO--UNDER WHICH RALEIGH WAS SITTING SMOKING HIS PIPE WHEN HIS SERVANT DRENCHED HIM
THE LATE LADY DOROTHY NEVILL SAID THAT ALTHOUGH CIGARETTES ARE A MODERN INVENTION SHE BELIEVED THAT THEY ALREADY EXISTED IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORM AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN OLD PENINSULAR OFFICERS USED TO SMOKE TOBACCO ROLLED UP TIGHT IN A PIECE OF PAPER
BUT IF THEY ARE NOT LITERALLY TRUE THEY ARE CERTAINLY WELL INVENTED FOR MOST OF THEM CAN BE PARALLELED AND ILLUSTRATED BY LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF UNDOUBTED AUTHENTICITY
IN FACT TO TRACE TOBACCO THROUGH THE PAGES OF PICKWICK IS TO REALIZE VIVIDLY HOW VULGAR IF NOT VICIOUS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT SMOKING WAS CONSIDERED BY THE FASHIONABLE WORLD AND HOW POPULAR IT WAS AMONG THE NOBODIES OF THE UNFASHIONABLE WORLD
THE DOZING SAGES DROP THE DROWSY STRAIN THEN PAUSE AND PUFF--AND SPEAK AND PAUSE AGAIN
WHEN A PINCH WAS WANTED THE ROOT WAS DRAWN A FEW TIMES OVER THE IRON RASP AND SO THE SNUFF WAS PRODUCED AND COULD BE OFFERED TO A FRIEND WITH MUCH MORE GRACE THAN UNDER THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PROCESS WITH THE POCKET-GRATER THE TOBACCONISTS SIGN THAT FOR VERY MANY YEARS WAS IN MOST GENERAL USE WAS THE FIGURE OF A HIGHLANDER WHICH MAY STILL PERHAPS BE FOUND IN ONE OR TWO PLACES BUT WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL AN UNUSUAL SIGHT IN THE STREETS OF LONDON AND OTHER TOWNS SOME FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS AGO
AT LAMBETH PALACE ONE SUNDAY IN FEBRUARY 1672 JOHN EACHARD THE AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS BOOK OR TRACT ON THE CONTEMPT OF THE CLERGY 1670 WHICH MACAULAY TURNED TO SUCH ACCOUNT DINED WITH ARCHBISHOP SHELDON
ANOTHER AND GREATER VICTORIAN GLADSTONE WAS ALSO A NON-SMOKER
THE SELLERS OF TOBACCO NATURALLY HUNG OUT THEIR SIGNS LIKE OTHER TRADESFOLK
AFTER ALL OUR INSTINCTS MAY BE BEST IT IS CLEAR FROM ONE OR TWO REFERENCES THAT LAMB AND COLERIDGE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SMOKE TOGETHER AT THEIR MEETINGS IN EARLY DAYS AT THE SALUTATION AND CAT"--WITH LESS DISASTROUS RESULTS TO COLERIDGE IT IS TO BE HOPED THAN THOSE WHICH FOLLOWED HIS BIRMINGHAM SMOKE AS SET FORTH IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
THERE ARE HINTS OF CHANGE IN THE RECORDS OF CITY AND OTHER COMPANIES
IT WAS PERHAPS THIS SAME POUCH OR CASE WHICH ONCE UPON A TIME FIGURED IN RALPH THORESBY'S MUSEUM AT LEEDS AND IS DESCRIBED BY THORESBY HIMSELF IN HIS DUCATUS LEODIENSIS 1715
SHOP-SIGNS WERE ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF THE STREETS OF OLD LONDON
THE FOLLOWING SONG IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO TAKEN FROM A COLLECTION WHICH WAS PRINTED IN 1660 IS TOUCHED WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME
HOWELL IN ONE OF HIS FAMILIAR LETTERS DATED JANUARY 1 1646 SAYS THAT THE SMOKE OF TOBACCO IS ONE OF THE WHOLESOMEST SENTS THAT IS AGAINST ALL CONTAGIOUS AIRS FOR IT OVERMASTERS ALL OTHER SMELLS AS KING JAMES THEY SAY FOUND TRUE WHEN BEING ONCE A HUNTING A SHOWR OF RAIN DRAVE HIM INTO A PIGSTY FOR SHELTER WHER HE CAUS'D A PIPE FULL TO BE TAKEN OF PURPOSE BUT HERE MR HOWELL IS CERTAINLY DRAWING THE LONG-BOW
SIR NORMAN LOCKYER REFERRING TO A PERIOD ABOUT 1867 MENTIONS MONDAY EVENINGS IN HIS HOUSE WHICH WERE GIVEN UP TO FRIENDS WHO CAME IN SANS CEREMONIE TO TALK AND SMOKE
THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF A WOODEN PIPE I HAVE MET WITH IS DATED 1765--BUT THIS WAS NOT IN ENGLAND
WILLOW-WOOD IS TOO SOFT SO THAT THE PIPES DID NOT LAST LONG
WE OURSELVES DURING THE TIME WE WERE THERE USED TO SUCK IT AFTER THEIR MANER AS ALSO SINCE OUR RETURNE AND HAVE FOUND MAINE
SOME PROJECTED FAR OVER THE NARROW ROADWAY--COMPETITION TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AND CUSTOM IS NO MODERN NOVELTY--SOME WERE FASTENED TO POSTS OR PILLARS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES
THE GROWTH OF CIGAR-SMOKING WAS RAPID
LONDON MARTIN SECKER NUMBER FIVE JOHN STREET ADELPHI FIRST PUBLISHED 1914 PRINTED AT THE BALLANTYNE PRESS LONDON TO J.H.M
SPEECHES WERE MADE AND TOASTS PROPOSED AND ALTOGETHER THE FOUR WHO DESIRED TO HAVE THE GRATIFICATION OF SAYING HEREAFTER THAT WE HAD SMOKED A PIPE IN THE SAME ROOM THAT THE MAN WHO FIRST INTRODUCED TOBACCO SMOKED IN HIMSELF SEEM TO HAVE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEMSELVES
IT WOULD BE EASY TO FILL MANY PAGES WITH THE LIKE TESTIMONIALS AND DENUNCIATIONS ESPECIALLY THE LATTER FROM WRITERS OF THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
IN THAT YEAR A GERMAN SCHOLAR PROFESSOR FRANZ VON HOLTZENDORFF PAID A VISIT TO A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE--HARDWICKE COURT
AN EXAMPLE IN THE COLCHESTER MUSEUM IS MADE OF COPPER AND BRASS WITH EMBOSSED DESIGNS AND INSCRIPTIONS REPRESENTING COMMERCE C ON THE BASE AND LID
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE AMERICAN COLONIES THE USE OF THE CREATURE CALLED TOBACKO WAS BY NO MEANS ENCOURAGED
THE PLANT WAS INTRODUCED INTO EUROPE AS WE HAVE SEEN ABOUT 1560 AND IT WAS UNDER CULTIVATION IN ENGLAND BY 1570
THE HOUSE HAD AS AUBREY TELLS US A LITTLE TURRET THAT LOOKED INTO AND OVER THE THAMES AND HAD THE PROSPECT WHICH IS AS PLEASANT PERHAPS AS ANY IN THE WORLD
THE PIPE IS A FEATURE IN ALL ILLUSTRATIONS OF COGERIAN MEETINGS THE INFLUENCE OF THE COURT WAS WHOLLY AGAINST SMOKING
IN 1659 JAMES BARNES ISSUED A FARTHING TOKEN FROM THE SUGAR LOAF AND THREE TOBACCO ROLLS IN THE POULTRY LONDON
THE BUZZ OF CONVERSATION AND THE SMOKE OF TOBACCO ALIKE FILLED THE ROOMS WHICH WERE THE FORERUNNERS OF THE CLUB-HOUSES OF A MUCH LATER DAY
WE THREE ARE ENGAGED IN ONE CAUSE I SNUFFS I SMOKES AND I CHAWS LARWOOD SAYS THAT A TOBACCONIST IN THE KINGSLAND ROAD HAD THE THREE MEN ON HIS SIGN BUT WITH A DIFFERENT LEGEND
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN EXCAVATIONS WERE BEING MADE AROUND THE FOUNDATIONS OF RALEIGH'S HOUSE AT YOUGHAL A CLAY PIPE-BOWL WAS DUG UP WHICH IN SIZE SHAPE C WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE PIPES IN THE WALLACE EXHIBIT
WITHIN THE LATTER THE DESIGN REPRESENTS THE INTERIOR OF A ROOM WITH TEN GENTLEMEN GATHERED NEAR A ROUND TABLE ON WHICH IS A BOWL OF PUNCH
IT IS ONLY WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT VISITS TO MUSIC-HALLS AND THEATRES OF VARIETIES HAVE BEEN SOCIALLY POSSIBLE TO LADIES
THE CAUSE WHEREFORE FEW RICH MEN'S SONS PROVE DISPUTANTS IN SCHOOLS IS THAT THEIR FATHERS FED ON FLESH AND THEY BEGAT FAT FOOLS
I GAVE MY OPINION WITH GREAT DECISION THAT TOBACCO WHISKY AND ALL SUCH STIMULANTS OR SEDATIVES HAD THEIR FOUNDATION IN NATURE COULD NOT BE ABOLISHED OR RATHER SHOULD NOT AND MUST BE CONTENT WITH THE CHECK OF A WISE REGULATION
THE DEBT CONFESS THOUGH NONE THE LESS THEY LOVE THE GRAPE AND BARLEY WHICH FRENCHMEN OWE TO GOOD NICOT AND ENGLISHMEN TO RALEIGH
AT METHWOLD SUFFOLK THE FOLK IMPROVED UPON THIS
A COOK SHOULD NOT LIVE AT THE BOOT NOR A SHOE-MAKER AT THE ROASTED PIG
THE ANGLER HAVING CAUGHT THE COVETED PRIZE REFILLS HIS PIPE AND WITH THE SATISFIED SENSE OF DUTY DONE AS THE RINGS CURL UPWARD HE REVIEWS THE STRUGGLE AND GLOWS AGAIN WITH VICTORY
A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PIPES OF THE CAROLINE PERIOD WITH THE USUAL SMALL ELONGATED BOWLS WERE FOUND IN 1902 AT CHICHESTER IN THE COURSE OF EXCAVATING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE OLD SWAN INN EAST STREET FOR BUILDING THE PRESENT BRANCH OF THE LONDON AND COUNTY BANK
ON ONE SIDE OF THE JOINT A BOTTLE AND TALL WINE-GLASS ON THE OTHER A PAIR OF LONG CLAY PIPES CROSSED AND A BOWL OF TOBACCO SHOWN IN SECTION THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE IMPLEMENT BEARS THE ENGRAVED NAME OF ITS SURREY MAKER AND THE DATE 1795
OR THE HUMOURS OF OXFORD 1691 SPEAKS INDEED OF UNDERGRADUATES WHO WHEN THEY COULD NOT GET TOBACCO DID MUCH AS THE PARSON OF THORNTON IS REPUTED TO HAVE DONE AS ALREADY RELATED IN CHAPTER II I.E THEY CONDESCENDED TO SMOKE FRAGMENTS OF MATS
THE SOCIETY'S MOTTO WAS HAPPILY CHOSEN--"LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE A FURTHER WITNESS TO THE PREVALENCE OF SMOKING AND TO THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF TOBACCO-SELLERS SHOPS IS CAMDEN THE ANTIQUARY
I WOULD BE LOATH YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE SCANDAL CHARGED UPON THE UNIVERSITIES OF LEARNING CHIEFLY TO SMOKE AND TO DRINK AT OXFORD IN EARLY GEORGIAN DAYS A PROFOUND CALM--SO FAR AS STUDY WAS CONCERNED--APPEARS TO HAVE PREVAILED
BUT WAS AGAIN LED TO USE IT BY THE EXAMPLE OF MY SON A HUSSAR OFFICER AND MY SON-IN-LAW AN OXFORD STUDENT
THE FOLLOWING IS AN ENTRY IN THE MINUTES OF THE FRIENDS MONTHLY MEETING AT HARDSHAW LANCASHIRE
GRADUALLY THE HORN BOX WAS ENSHRINED WITHIN ONE CASE AFTER ANOTHER--USUALLY SILVER LINED WITH VELVET--EACH CASE BEARING INSCRIBED PLATES COMMEMORATING PERSONS OR EVENTS
AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN MR PICKWICK CALLS A CAB AT SAINT MARTIN'S-LE-GRAND THE FIRST CAB IS FETCHED FROM THE PUBLIC-HOUSE WHERE HE HAD BEEN SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE AT ROCHESTER MR PICKWICK MAKES NOTES ON THE FOUR TOWNS OF STROOD ROCHESTER CHATHAM AND BROMPTON WHERE THE MILITARY WERE PRESENT IN STRENGTH AND HENCE THE OBSERVANT GENTLEMAN NOTED--"THE CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO IN THESE TOWNS MUST BE VERY GREAT
THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
LUCAS WHO GIVES IT IN HIS WANDERER IN LONDON AS THE NUMBER OF THE SURVIVORS
AFTER MORNING SERVICE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO REPAIR TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC-HOUSE WHERE HE ENJOYED A MUTTON-CHOP AND POTATOES
AWAY YE FOND ENTHUSIASTS
IF IT OFFEND SAIES TARLTON LET EVERY ONE TAKE A LITTLE OF THE SMELL AND SO THE SAVOUR WILL QUICKLY GOE
DIEU NOUS A DONNE LE TABAC POUR ENDORMIR NOS PASSIONS ET NOS DOULEURS M.A
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE THREE CLASSES TEND TO COMBINE INTO ONE
COME AGAIN SOON TENNYSON'S OWN DEVOTION TO TOBACCO LED ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION TO A PECULIAR AND SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE PROCEEDING
AND IN 1766 MR HOPPIE OF THE OIL JAR
ON TOBACCO"--WHICH SHOWS THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE FLUCTUATION BETWEEN 1604 AND 1615--WHILE IN SEPTEMBER 1621 THE DUTY STOOD AT 9D
MR MUNBY AFTER THIS REFERENCE TO SMOLLETT'S ADVENTURE PROCEEDED TO CLAIM THE HONOUR OF HAVING HELPED TO BRING THE USE OF WOODEN PIPES INTO ENGLAND
IN THE PLATE WHICH SHOWS THE EXECUTION OF THOMAS IDLE IN THE INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS SERIES HOGARTH DEPICTS THE LITTLE HANGMAN SMOKING A SHORT PIPE AS HE SITS ON THE TOP OF THE GALLOWS WAITING FOR HIS VICTIM
AROUND THE TABLE ARE FOUR MEN AND A WOMAN WHILE A BOY APPROACHES CARRYING TWO HUGE MEASURES OF ALE
POSSIBLY SHE WAS NOT A SMOKER AT ALL BUT NEEDED THE TOBACCO FOR SOME MEDICINAL PURPOSE
SMOKING UNFASHIONABLE
VOLUMES OF SMOKE ARE POURING AGAINST THE SURFACE OF THE PICTURE FROM BOTH HIS MOUTH AND THE BOWL OF HIS LONG CLAY PIPE
THESE COUNTRY SMOKING-ROOMS WERE KNOWN IN LATER DAYS AS STONE-PARLOURS THE FLOOR BEING FLAGGED FOR SAFETY'S SAKE
THE HABIT OF SNUFFING HAD LONG BEEN FALLING INTO DESUETUDE
BUT--HE SMOKES TOBACCO
SHE CAME DIVERS TYMES TO HIS SHOPPE TO BUY TOBACCO THERE
SIDGWICK'S PRAISE OF TOBACCO CLASSICALLY DRAPED IN GREEK VERSE OCCASIONALLY OF THE MACARONIC ORDER IS DELIGHTFUL
MR JOHN SMAUKER WHO INTRODUCES SAM WELLER AT THE FRIENDLY SWARRY OF THE BATH FOOTMEN SMOKES A CIGAR THROUGH AN AMBER TUBE"--CIGAR-HOLDERS WERE A NOVELTY
NO ONE CAN GET TOO EXCITED OR OVER-HEATED IN ARGUMENT NO ONE CAN NEGLECT THE OBSERVANCE OF THE AMENITIES OF CONVERSATION WHO TALKS THOUGHTFULLY BETWEEN THE PULLS AT HIS PIPE WHO HAS TO PAUSE NOW AND AGAIN TO REFILL TO STRIKE A LIGHT TO KNOCK OUT THE ASHES OR TO PERFORM ONE OF THOSE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ACTS OF DEVOTION AT THE SHRINE OF ST NICOTINE WHICH FILL UP THE PAUSES AND CONDUCE TO REFLECTION
PUNCH'S POCKET-BOOK FOR 1878 HAD AN AMUSING SKIT ON A LADIES READING-PARTY TO WHICH MR PUNCH ACTED AS COACH AFTER BREAKFAST THE READING LADIES LOUNGED ON THE LAWN WITH CIGARETTES
NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNFASHIONABLENESS OF TOBACCO THERE WERE STILL SOME NOTEWORTHY SMOKERS TO BE FOUND AMONG THE CLERGY
FY
FOR HE HA'S DAILY TRYALL OF MENS NOSTRILS AND NONE IS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HUMORS
BOX FOR 7S
HOGARTH HIMSELF WAS A CONFIRMED PIPE-LOVER
AND ALSO WITH MORE PLAUSIBILITY OF HIS HOME AT YOUGHAL IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
AND SMOKING WAS MADE A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW OF 1672
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SMOKING MAINTAINED ITS HOLD UPON ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY BUT IN THE LATER DECADES THERE ARE DISTINCT SIGNS THAT THE HABIT WAS BECOMING LESS UNIVERSAL
TARLTON'S JESTS APPEARED IN 1611 AND THE STORY IN QUESTION WHICH IS HEADED HOW TARLTON TOOKE TOBACCO AT THE FIRST COMMING UP OF IT RUNS AS FOLLOWS
BUT PROBABLY IT HAD NO GREATER EFFECT THAN THE TERRIBLE CURSE IN THE JACKDAW OF RHEIMS ANOTHER TRACT WHICH MAY BE CLASSED WITH VENNER'S TREATISE WAS THE NEPENTHES OR THE VERTUES OF TOBACCO BY DR WILLIAM BARCLAY WHICH WAS PUBLISHED AT EDINBURGH IN 1614
OF COURSE IN THOSE DAYS NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF SMOKING A PIPE IN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES COLONEL HAROLD MALET AT THE SAME TIME WROTE--"WHEN I WAS A CADET AT SANDHURST IN 1855-58 MILO'S CUTTY PIPES WERE QUITE THE THING AND THE SELECTION BY CADETS OF A GOOD ONE OUT OF A FRESH CONSIGNMENT PACKED IN SAWDUST WAS EAGERLY WATCHED BY THE JOHNS OF COURSE WE WERE IMITATING OUR PARENTS IT WAS NO DOUBT THESE CUTTY PIPES WHICH ARE REFERRED TO IN ONE OF THE SPORTING BOOKS OF ROBERT SURTEES AS THE CLAY PIPES OF GENTILITY IN A PRIVATE LETTER TO ME WHICH I AM PRIVILEGED TO QUOTE COLONEL PRIDEAUX ADDS SOME FURTHER PARTICULARS AS TO THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE OF EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS TOWARDS TOBACCO--PARTICULARS WHICH ARE THE MORE VALUABLE AND INTERESTING AS BEING SUPPLIED FROM PERSONAL RECOLLECTION OF THOSE NOW SOMEWHAT DISTANT DAYS
A TAILOR AT THE LION
THE CHURCHWARDENS ACCOUNTS OF ST PETER'S BARNSTAPLE FOR 1741 CONTAIN THE ENTRY
THE IDEA APPEARS TO BE THAT A PIPE IS VULGAR
NO NEWS OF YOUR BOX
IT WAS IN 1818 THAT LAMB PUBLISHED THE COLLECTION OF HIS WRITINGS IN TWO VOLUMES WHICH CONTAINED THE WELL-KNOWN FAREWELL TO TOBACCO WRITTEN IN 1805 AND REFERRED TO IN THE LETTER OF THAT YEAR TO WORDSWORTH QUOTED ABOVE
LORD FOPLIN SMOKES NOT--FOR HIS TEETH AFRAID
THE GENERALITY OF WHOM CAN NO MORE WRITE A SERMON WITHOUT A PIPE IN THEIR MOUTHS THAN A CONCORDANCE IN THEIR HANDS FROM THE EVIDENCE SO FAR ADDUCED IT MAY FAIRLY BE CONCLUDED I THINK THAT DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SMOKING WAS NOT FASHIONABLE OR INDEED ANYTHING BUT RARE AMONG THE WOMEN OF THE MORE WELL-TO-DO CLASSES WHILE AMONG WOMEN OF HUMBLER RANK IT WAS AN OCCASIONAL AND IN A FEW DISTRICTS A FAIRLY GENERAL HABIT
THESE SERVANTS COPY THE TALK AND STYLE WITH A DIFFERENCE OF THEIR EMPLOYERS
THERE IS OF COURSE AN ELEMENT OF EXAGGERATION IN ALL THIS
BURNAND'S BURLESQUE BLUEBEARD WAS PRODUCED AT THE GAIETY THEATRE
WHILE SIR ROGER'S COMPANION WAS WONDERING WHAT THIS WOULD END IN THE KNIGHT BID HIS JEHU TO STOP BY THE WAY AT ANY GOOD TOBACCONIST'S AND TAKE IN A ROLL OF THEIR BEST VIRGINIA AND WHEN HE VISITED SQUIRE'S NEAR GRAY'S INN GATE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO CALL FOR A CLEAN PIPE A PAPER OF TOBACCO A DISH OF COFFEE A NEWSPAPER AND A WAX CANDLE
THESE VENDORS AFTER DUE EXAMINATION AS TO THEIR FITNESS WERE TO BE PERMITTED ON PAYMENT OF CERTAIN COMPOSITIONS AND AN ANNUAL RENT IN AUGMENTATION OF THE KING'S REVENUE TO SELL TOBACCO IN SMALL QUANTITIES
IN A FEW PROVINCIAL TOWNS A WOODEN HIGHLANDER MAY STILL BE FOUND AT THE DOOR OF TOBACCO SHOPS BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY DESTINED TO EARLY DISAPPEARANCE
FOR TOBACCO 0
AND PUTTING FIRE TO IT THEY DRAW THE SMOAK INTO THEIR MOUTHS WHICH THEY PUFF OUT AGAIN THROUGH THEIR NOSTRILS LIKE FUNNELS ALONG WITH IT PLENTY OF PHLEGM AND DEFLUXIONS FROM THE HEAD THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE UNPLEASANT AND QUITE UNNECESSARY HABIT OF SPITTING WAS COMMON WITH THESE EARLY SMOKERS A SUGGESTION WHICH IS AMPLY SUPPORTED BY OTHER CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE
FROM KENSAL GREEN WAS MR ALFRED MONTGOMERY'S REPLY
THESE ARE LEAVES OF TOBACCO ROLLED UP IN SUCH MANNER THAT THEY SERVE BOTH FOR A PIPE AND TOBACCO ITSELF
REFERRING TO A DEBATE ON JANUARY 7 1656-57 ON AN ATTEMPT TO GO BEHIND THE PREVIOUSLY PASSED ACT OF OBLIVION THE DIARIST RECORDS THAT SIR JOHN REYNOLDS HAD NUMBERED THE HOUSE AND SAID AT RISING THERE WERE 220 AT THE LEAST BESIDES TOBACCONISTS THIS CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST 220 MEMBERS ACTUALLY PRESENT IN THE HOUSE WHEN IT ROSE NOT COUNTING THE TOBACCONISTS OR SMOKERS WHO WERE ENJOYING THEIR PIPES NOT IN THE CHAMBER ITSELF BUT IN SOME CONVENIENTLY ADJOINING PLACE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN A ROOM FOR THE PURPOSE OR MAY SIMPLY HAVE BEEN THE LOBBY REFERRED TO ABOVE IN THE EXTRACT FROM MERCURIUS PRAGMATICUS IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT RICHARD CROMWELL WAS A SMOKER
BUT AT LAST HE WAS SO SICK THAT TWAS THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE DYED
HE TOLD STELLA THAT HE HAD LEFT OFF SNUFF ALTOGETHER AND THEN IN THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE REMARKED THAT HE HAD A NOBLE ROLL OF TOBACCO FOR GRATING VERY GOOD AND IN A LATER LETTER TO STELLA MAY 24 1711 HE ASKED IF SHE STILL SNUFFED AND WENT ON TO SAY IN SENTENCES THAT SEEM TO CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER
IN 1604 KING JAMES I NEWLY COME TO THE THRONE AND FULL OF ICONOCLASTIC FERVOUR AGAINST THE WEED RAISED THE DUTY TO 6S

AT BIRMINGHAM ONE DAY HE DINED WITH A WORTHY TRADESMAN WHO AFTER DINNER IMPORTUNED HIM TO SMOKE A PIPE WITH HIM AND TWO OR THREE OTHER ILLUMINATI OF THE SAME RANK THE REMAINDER OF THE MOVING STORY MUST BE TOLD IN COLERIDGE'S OWN WORDS
WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS NOWADAYS IF SMOKING TAKES PLACE IN CHURCH AT ALL IT CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH INTENTIONAL IRREVERENCE
AND IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOUSE MAY STILL BE SEEN THE REMAINS OF THE MULBERRY TREE UNDER WHICH MR AUSTIN DOBSON SUGGESTS THAT HOGARTH AND FIELDING MAY HAVE SAT AND SMOKED THEIR PIPES TOGETHER IN THE DAYS WHEN GEORGE WAS KING
THE LATE DR NORMAN KERR WHO WAS NO FRIEND TO ORDINARY EVERYDAY SMOKING WROTE
BUT THIS TOBACA I HAVE HAD THIS SIX MONTHS WHICH WAS SUCH AS MY SON BROUGHT HOME BUT SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD NONE
HE TELLS US THAT ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY THE LANDLADIES SUP WITH STRANGERS AND PASSENGERS AND IF THEY HAVE DAUGHTERS THESE ALSO ARE OF THE COMPANY TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS AT TABLE WITH PLEASANT CONCEITS WHERE THEY DRINK AS MUCH AS THE MEN
BUT SMOKING IS NEVER MENTIONED
IT'S BOARD AND LODGING TO ME IS SMOKE MR PICKWICK GLANCES AT THE SPEAKER AND THINKS THAT IF IT WERE WASHING TOO IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTER
THE FRENCHMAN WONDERED AND I LAUGHED AT HIS INTEMPERANCIE IT IS A LITTLE CURIOUS CONSIDERING THE DEVOTION OF LATTER-DAY MEN OF LETTERS TO TOBACCO THAT IN THEIR EARLY DAYS SO MANY OF THE MEN WHO WROTE ON THE SUBJECT ATTACKED THE SOCIAL USE OF TOBACCO WITH VIOLENCE AND VIRULENCE
MR ARTHUR DENMAN F.S.A WRITING IN NOTES AND QUERIES APRIL 17 1909 SAID
IT WOULD SEEM TO BE MORE LIKELY THAT THIS PARTICULAR FIGURE WAS OF UNUSUAL PERHAPS UNIQUE MAKE AND HAD SOME SPECIAL LOCAL OR INDIVIDUAL SIGNIFICANCE WHEREVER OR FOR WHOM IT WAS FIRST MADE AND USED WHICH HAS NOW BEEN FORGOTTEN
THERE IS ONE ENTRY OF PERFUMED TOBACKA 10 OZ
THACKERAY IN THE BOOK OF SNOBS DESCRIBES YOUTHS AT A UNIVERSITY WINE-PARTY AS DRINKING BAD WINES TELLING BAD STORIES SINGING BAD SONGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THE HONOUR IS DIVIDED AMONG SEVERAL CLAIMANTS
AND A PROBLEM WHICH THEY CANNOT SOLVE MAY NOT UNREASONABLY BE REGARDED AS INSOLUBLE
AMERICAN DAUGHTER SIXTEEN NOW OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR SISTERS C
THE AMERICAN INDIANS REPRESENTED UNDER THE FIGURE OF THE VIRGINIAN AND THE NEGROES WERE HOPELESSLY CONFUSED BY THE EARLY TOBACCONISTS WITH RESULTS WHICH WERE SOMETIMES SURPRISING FROM AN ETHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW
EVEN QUAKERESSES SOMETIMES SMOKED
THE OTHER SMOKERS IN JOSEPH ANDREWS ARE THE SURGEON AND THE EXCISEMAN WHO EARLY IN THE STORY ARE FOUND SITTING IN THE INN KITCHEN WITH PARSON BARNABAS SMOKING THEIR PIPES OVER SOME SYDERAND"--THE MYSTERIOUS CUP BEING A MIXTURE OF CIDER AND SOMETHING SPIRITUOUS--AND JOSEPH'S FATHER OLD GAFFER ANDREWS WHO APPEARS AT THE END OF THE STORY AND COMPLAINS BITTERLY THAT HE WANTS HIS PIPE NOT HAVING HAD A WHIFF THAT MORNING
BUT SMOKING AND THE ANNUAL DINNERS WERE LONG ASSOCIATED
TOBACCO WAS SMOKED BY ALL CLASSES AND IN ALMOST ALL PLACES
AND LARGE NUMBERS OF SIGNS WERE HUNG OVER THE DOORS WHILE MANY OTHERS WERE AFFIXED TO THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES

YET NOW I SEE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WALKING ALONGSIDE OF ONE ANOTHER'S SISTERS SMOKING A SHORT PIPE DOWN THE STREET THE GIRLS LIKE IT SAYS NEPOS
EVENTUALLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SIGNS GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED AND THE STREETS WERE NUMBERED
AND THY PRETTY SWELLING CREST WITH MY LITTLE STOPPER PREST AND THE SWEETEST BLISS OF BLISSES BREATHING FROM THY BALMY KISSES
IN THESE RAW MORNINGS WHEN I'M FREEZING RIPE WHAT CAN COMPARE WITH A TOBACCO-PIPE
I'D RATHER IT HAD BEEN SHAG CHARLES LAMB WAS A HEAVY PIPE-SMOKER
AT WHICH TIME HE ORDER'D A SIMPLE FELLOW WHO WAITED TO BRING HIM UP A TANKARD OF OLD ALE AND NUTMEG ALWAYS LAYING ASIDE THE PIPE WHEN HE HEARD HIS SERVANT COMING ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HOWEVER THE PIPE WAS NOT LAID ASIDE IN TIME AND THE SIMPLE FELLOW IMAGINING HIS MASTER WAS ON FIRE AS HE SAW THE SMOKE ISSUING FROM HIS MOUTH PROMPTLY PUT THE FIRE OUT BY SOUSING HIM WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE TANKARD
I DISCOVERED AFTERWARDS THAT THEY HAD BEEN REGULAR COMMUNICANTS AND THAT MY PREDECESSOR ALWAYS DISTRIBUTED THE OFFERTORY TO THE POOR PRESENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SERVICE
ONCE UPON A TIME THE COGERS SWARMED TO A WELL-APPOINTED ROOM WHERE CARPETS COVERED THE FLOORS THE CHAIRS WERE UPHOLSTERED AND THE TABLES HAD FINELY POLISHED MARBLE TOPS
THREEPENCE A PIPE-FULL I WILL HAVE MADE OF ALL MY WHOLE HALF-POUND OF TOBACCO AND A QUARTER OF A POUND OF COLTSFOOT MIXT WITH IT TOO TO EKE IT OUT THE FUMES OF DRIED COLTSFOOT LEAVES WERE USED AS A REMEDY IN CASES OF DIFFICULTY OF BREATHING BOTH IN ANCIENT ROMAN TIMES AND IN TUDOR ENGLAND

DEKKER SUGGESTS PROBABLY WITH TRUTH THAT ONE REASON WHY THE YOUNG GALLANT LIKED TO PUSH HIS WAY TO A STOOL ON THE STAGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE MEWES AND HISSES OF THE OPPOSED RASCALITY"--THE MEWES MUST HAVE BEEN THE SQUEALS OR WHISTLES PRODUCED BY THE INSTRUMENT WHICH WAS LATER KNOWN AS A CAT-CALL--WAS THE OPPORTUNITY SUCH A PROMINENT POSITION AFFORDED FOR THE DISPLAY OF THE BEST AND MOST ESSENTIAL PARTS OF A GALLANT--GOOD CLOATHES A PROPORTIONABLE LEGGE WHITE HAND THE PERSIAN LOCK AND A TOLERABLE BEARD APPARENTLY TOO SERVING-BOYS WERE WITHIN CALL AND THUS LIGHTS COULD EASILY BE OBTAINED WHICH WERE HANDED TO ONE ANOTHER BY THE SMOKERS ON THE POINTS OF THEIR SWORDS
VENNER SAYS THAT TOBACCO IS OF INEFFABLE FORCE FOR THE RAPID HEALING OF WOUNDS CUTS SORES AND SO ON BY EXTERNAL APPLICATION BUT THINKS LITTLE OF ITS USE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
AN ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN THE MORNING POST OF FEBRUARY 20 1913 MAY BE REGARDED AS A SIGN OF THE TIMES
IN THE MORNING HEE FELL TO HIS OLD COURS NOTWITHSTANDING
ON THE EXPOSED SIDE OF THE BAT IS WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO REPRESENT A LOOSE STRIP OF WOOD
THE FOLLOWING STORY WAS TOLD NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO OF THE LATE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE
WHEN OUR GALLANT WENT TO THE THEATRE HE LOVED TO OCCUPY ONE OF THE STOOLS AT THE SIDE OF THE STAGE
THUS THE TRADITION WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN DATES FROM 1708 ONLY HAS OBTAINED TWO LOCAL HABITATIONS--YOUGHAL AND DURHAM HOUSE ON THE ADELPHI SITE
PROBABLY THEY WERE ISSUED IN LONDON SOME TIME BEFORE IT WAS CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO LICENSE DEALERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AMERICAN LADY MARRIED AT SIXTEEN
A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES DESCRIBES IT AS A VERY FINE SPECIMEN IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND ADDS
THE AUTHOR WAS ISAAC HAWKINS BROWNE AND THE POETS IMITATED WERE THE LAUREATE CIBBER PHILIPS THOMSON YOUNG POPE AND SWIFT
THE FELLOW WHO OWNS IT MUST BE WORTH A MINT OF MONEY SAID THE AMERICAN THROUGH HIS CIGAR-SMOKE
RELICS OF THIS TIME MAY STILL BE SEEN IN MANY STATIONS AND ON MANY PLATFORMS IN THE SHAPE OF SOMEWHAT DINGY PLACARDS ANNOUNCING THAT SMOKING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN AND THAT THE PENALTY IS SO MUCH
THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE GALLANTS OF THE RESTORATION COURT SMOKED
THEY SOMETIMES HAD A TOBACCO-STOPPER RIVETED IN NEAR THE AXIS OF THE TONGS AND THUS COULD BE EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER KINDS OF TONGS
MUCH THAT IS FULLY AND WELL TREATED IN SUCH A WORK AS FAIRHOLT'S HISTORY IS IGNORED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES
HAYNE BOUGHT HIS SUPPLIES FROM FOUR OF THE LEADING GOLDSMITHS OF THE CITY WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD DEALINGS WITH THEM IN THEIR OWN SPECIAL WARES ALSO FROM TWO DRAPERS ONE GROCER AND FOUR OTHER TRADESMEN ON A SINGLE OCCASION EACH WHOSE PARTICULAR OCCUPATIONS ARE UNKNOWN
AND THE SAME WRITER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SATIRICAL LETTER TO AN OLD LADY THAT SMOAK'D TOBACCO WHICH SHOWS THAT THE PRACTICE WAS NOT GENERAL FOR THE LETTER BEGINS
FOX SAYS IN HIS JOURNAL I LOOKT UPON HIM TO BEE A FORWARDE BOLDE LAD
BUT JOSHUA SYLVESTER HAD EASILY SURPASSED THIS WHEN HE WROTE HIS TOBACCO BATTERED AND THE PIPES SHATTERED ABOUT THEIR EARES THAT IDELY IDOLIZE SO BASE AND BARBAROUS A WEED OR AT LEAST OVERLOVE SO LOATHSOME A VANITY BY A VOLLEY OF HOLY SHOT THUNDERED FROM MOUNT HELICON 1615
IN THE EVENING AT ANOTHER TAVERN HE SMOKES A PIPE AND DRINKS TWO PINTS OF CIDER WINDING UP THE INANE DAY AT HIS CLUB WHERE HE SMOKES THREE PIPES BEFORE COMING HOME AT TWELVE TO GO TO BED AND SLEEP SOUNDLY
AN ENGLISH WRITER ON THRIFT IN 1676 SAID THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR A MECHANIC TRADESMAN TO GO TO THE COFFEE-HOUSE OR ALE-HOUSE IN THE MORNING TO DRINK HIS MORNING'S DRAUGHT AND THERE HE WOULD SPEND TWOPENCE AND CONSUME AN HOUR IN SMOKING AND TALKING SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS OF THE EVENING IN SIMILAR FASHION
THE TRACING AND RECORDING OF THIS SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE SMOKING-HABIT TOUCHING AS IT DOES SO MANY INTERESTING POINTS AND DETAILS OF DOMESTIC MANNERS AND CUSTOMS HAS BEEN A TASK OF PECULIAR PLEASURE
PERSEVERENCE REPLACED WITH PERSEVERANCE | | PAGE 231
BUT THE ALLEGATION INTRODUCED BY A QUESTION-BEGGING UNDOUBTEDLY THAT SMOKING OCCASIONED DRINKING WAS DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO FACT
SOON CRACKS IN COMMON-ROOM THE SAME OLD JOKES DRINKING THREE GLASSES ERE THREE PIPES HE SMOKES AND WHAT HE DID WHILE CHARLES OUR THRONE DID FILL NEATH GEORGE'S HEIR YOU'LL FIND HIM DOING STILL IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT COUNTRY PARSONS SMOKED
THE FIRST IMITATION IS CALLED A NEW YEAR'S ODE AND CONTAINS THREE RECITATIVES THREE AIRS AND A CHORUS
THE TENTH AND LAST PRECEPT IS THAT YOU GOE NOT ABROAD INTO THE AIRE PRESENTLY IMMEDIATELY UPON THE TAKING OF THE FUME BUT RATHER REFRAIN THEREFROM THE SPACE OF HALFE AN HOURE OR MORE ESPECIALLY IF THE SEASON BE COLD OR MOIST THE SUGGESTION THAT THE SMOKER WHEN HE HAS FINISHED HIS PIPE SHALL WAIT FOR HALF AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE VENTURES INTO THE OUTER AIR IS VERY QUAINT
SOE MUCH MONEY AS WAS FORMERLY WASTED BY THE WEEK IN TO SERVING HIS FAMILY AFTERWARD WEEKLY AMONG THE MANY MEDICINAL VIRTUES ATTRIBUTED TO TOBACCO WAS ITS SUPPOSED VALUE AS A PRESERVATIVE FROM CONTAGION AT TIMES OF PLAGUE
IN CASH--THE REST OF THE VALUE OF THE BOX HE NOTED I FREELY FORGAVE HIM FOR WRITING AT OUR FIRST COMMISSION FOR ME AND FOR COPYING OF ANSWERS AND YE LIKE IN OUR LAW CONCERNS
BY THE HANDS OF SIR RICHARD BURTON THE QUEEN HAD SENT A DAMASK TENT A SILVER PIPE AND TWO SILVER TRAYS TO THE KING OF DAHOMEY
BY THIS LIGHT I WONDER THAT ANY MAN IS SO MAD TO COME TO SEE THESE RASCALLY TITS PLAY HERE--THEY DO ACT LIKE SO MANY WRENS--NOT THE FIFTH PART OF A GOOD FACE AMONGST THEM ALL--AND THEN THEIR MUSICK IS ABOMINABLE--ABLE TO STRETCH A MAN'S EARS WORSE THAN TEN--PILLORIES AND THEIR DITTIES--MOST LAMENTABLE THINGS LIKE THE PITIFUL FELLOWS THAT MAKE THEM--POETS
TOBACCO SERVES TO AIRE HIM AFTER A WASHING I.E A DRINKING-BOUT AND IS HIS ONELY BREATH AND BREATHING WHILE IN ANOTHER A TAVERN IS THE COMMON CONSUMPTION OF THE AFTERNOONE AND THE MURDERER OR MAKER AWAY OF A RAINY DAY
FOR TOBACCO AND FRANKINCENSE BURNT IN THE CHURCH 2S
BARRIERS AND PREJUDICES CRUMBLED AND DISAPPEARED WITH INCREASING RAPIDITY
THIS SPLENDID ROOM IN THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY DAYS OF GAMBLING WAS THE GRAND SUBSCRIPTION ROOM"--THE GAMBLING ROOM OF GEORGIAN TIMES
HE SAYS TO HE'S MISTUS ONE DAY HE SAYS TIS A LONG TIME SAYS HE SENCE I'VE TOOK A HOLIDAY--SO CARDENLY NEX MARNIN HE LAID ABED TILL PURTY NIGH SEVEN O'CLOCK AND THEN HE BRACKFUSTES AND THEN HE GOOS DOWN TO THE SHOP AND BUYS FOWER OUNCES OF BARCA AND HE SETS HISSELF DOWN ON THE MAXON MANURE HEAP AND THERE HE SET AND THERE HE SMOKED AND SMOKED AND SMOKED ALL THE WHOLE DAY LONG FOR SAYS HE TIS A LONG TIME SENCE I'VE HAD A HOLIDAY
THIS LIST OF DEBTS IT APPEARS GIVES THE MOST COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF THE EXPENSES OF A DANDY OF THE COURT OF GEORGE II CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF SWORDS BUCKLES LACE VALENCIENNES AND POINT D'ESPAGNE GOLD AND AMBER-HEADED CANES TAVERN BILLS AND CHAIR HIRE BUT IN ALL THE AMPLE DETAIL OF CAPTAIN POWYS'S LIST OF EXTRAVAGANCES THERE IS NOTHING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATING TO SMOKING
IN NOVEMBER 1789 PARR WROTE TO DR BURNEY
TUPMAN AND SNODGRASS WERE OF THE COMPANY AND SMOKED CIGARS
AND POSITIVE STATEMENTS OF THE AVERSION OF THE BEAUX FROM SMOKING ARE NOT LACKING
THOSE WHO KNEW THOSE CONVENTIONS BUT DISREGARDED THEM AND SMOKED AS AND WHAT THEY PLEASED
THEY ALL NECESSARILY HAVE THE EXAGGERATION OF CARICATURE
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WROTE AGAIN TO HIS SISTERS BUT THIS TIME FROM THE LIBRARY WHERE HE SAYS WE ARE IN A FAR BETTER ATMOSPHERE THAN IN THE SMOKING-ROOM WHENCE I WROTE TO YOU LAST WEEK ONE WONDERS WHY MACAULAY WHO APPARENTLY DID NOT SMOKE HIMSELF AND WHO THOUGH SOMEWHAT MORE TOLERANT OF TOBACCO THAN HIS FATHER ZACHARY MACAULAY EVIDENTLY DID NOT LIKE THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SMOKING-ROOM CHOSE TO WRITE THERE WHEN THE LIBRARY--WHERE HE MUST SURELY HAVE FELT MORE AT HOME--WAS AVAILABLE
ON THE LAST DAY OF 1640 HAYNE PAID MR DRAKES MAN 1S
THEY COVER TWO MONTHS ONLY AND SHOW THAT THE MINISTER WAS A FURIOUS SMOKER
AND GREATLY MUST THEY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE QUAINT AND PICTURESQUE APPEARANCE OF THE STREETS
CONTROVERSIALISTS OF THAT PERIOD REJOICED IN FULL-WORDED TITLES AND IN FULL-BLOODED PRAISE OR ABUSE
ANOTHER CLASS OF SIGN OR EMBLEM WAS REPRESENTED BY THE WOODEN MIDSHIPMAN WHICH MANY OF US HAVE SEEN IN LEADENHALL STREET AND WHICH DICKENS MADE FAMOUS IN DOMBEY AND SON SOMETIMES THE WOODEN FIGURE OF A SAILOR STOOD OUTSIDE PUBLIC-HOUSES WITH SUCH SIGNS AS THE JOLLY SAILOR
ANOTHER CONNOISSEUR PAPER OF 1754 REFERS TO THE CITIZENS COUNTRY-BOXES AS DUSTY RETREATS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS BUILT IN CLOSE CONTIGUITY TO THE HIGHWAY SO THAT THE INHABITANTS COULD WATCH THE TRAFFIC IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYTHING MORE SENSIBLE TO DO WHERE THE WANT OF LONDON SMOKE IS SUPPLIED BY THE SMOKE OF VIRGINIA TOBACCO AND WHERE OUR CHIEF CITIZENS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO PASS THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF EVERY WEEK IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF A VISIT TO VAUXHALL BY A WORTHY CITIZEN WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP THE ENEMY OUT OF ENGLAND
10 JUNE THE SD DAY FOR TOBACCO AND STUFFES 0
SORBIERE WHO HAS BEEN QUOTED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER REMARKED IN 1663 THAT PEOPLE OF QUALITY DID NOT USE TOBACCO SO MUCH AS OTHERS
THIS MAN DREAMED THAT HE WAS TAKING TOBACCO AND THAT THE DEVILL STOOD BY HIM FILLING ONE PIPE UPON ANOTHER FOR HIM
PER LB
PER LB
PER LB
PER LB
THE PROPERLY ACCOMPLISHED GALLANT NOT ONLY PROFESSED TO BE CURIOUSLY LEARNED IN PIPES AND TOBACCO BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF PRICES AND THEIR FLUCTUATIONS OF THE APOTHECARIES AND OTHER SHOPS WHERE THE HERB WAS SOLD AND OF THE LATEST AND MOST FASHIONABLE WAYS OF INHALING AND EXHALING THE SMOKE WAS LIKE MR WELLER'S KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON EXTENSIVE AND PECULIAR IT WAS KNOWLEDGE OF THIS KIND THAT GAINED FOR A GALLANT REPUTATION AND RESPECT BY NO MEANS TO BE ACQUIRED BY MERE SCHOLARSHIP AND LEARNING
ONLY THREE WEEKS
AND IF HE EVER FEELS INCLINED TO WHEN IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT WHY HE LIGHTS HIS PIPE AND VERY SOON SMOKES THE IDEA OF SUCH FOLLY OUT OF HIS HEAD
WHEREAS COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN MADE THAT SOME UNDERGRADUATE MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY ARE IN THE HABIT OF SMOKING AT PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS AND OTHERWISE CREATING ANNOYANCE THEY ARE HEREBY CAUTIONED AGAINST THE REPETITION OF SUCH UNGENTLEMANLIKE CONDUCT THERE WAS PLENTY OF SMOKING AMONG UNDERGRADUATES AT OXFORD IN THOSE DAYS AS MAY BE SEEN IN SUCH BOOKS AS THE ADVENTURES OF MR VERDANT GREEN AND HUGHES'S TOM BROWN AT OXFORD BOTH OF WHICH DATE FROM 1861
MAKE NO MORE STIRRE QUOTH TARLTON THE FIRE IS QUENCHED
IN SOME PLACES OF RESORT THERE ARE NOTICES EXHIBITED WHICH SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT THE SMOKING OF PIPES
SEPT
HIS CARICATURE IN VANITY FAIR REPRESENTS HIM WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH ALTHOUGH HE IS WEARING AN OPERA-HAT BLACK FROCK-COAT BUTTONED UP AND A CLOAK
AND ALL THE BOYS IN THE COFFEE-ROOM RAN TO SERVE HIM
HIGH AND IT DIFFERS FROM THOSE USUALLY MET WITH IN THAT UNDER THE LEFT ARM IS AN IMPLEMENT ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE A CRICKET-BAT
THE SALVATION ARMY DO NOT ENFORCE TOTAL ABSTINENCE FROM TOBACCO AS WELL AS FROM ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AS A CONDITION OF MEMBERSHIP OR SOLDIERSHIP BUT A MEMBER OF THE ARMY MUST BE A NON-SMOKER BEFORE HE CAN HOLD ANY OFFICE IN ITS RANK OR BE A BANDSMAN OR A MEMBER OF A SONGSTER BRIGADE AND IN OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE YET A FEW OF THE UNCO GUID WHO LOOK ASKANCE AT PIPE OR CIGARETTE AS IF IT WERE A DEVICE OF THE DEVIL
THE WOMEN'S CHEST WE ARE TOLD CONTAINED AMONG A HOST OF OTHER GOOD AND USEFUL THINGS BALM SAGE SUMMER SAVOURY HOREHOUND TOBACCO AND ORANGES
CHARLES KEENE'S ATTITUDE WAS THAT OF MANY ARTISTS
TIMES HAVE CHANGED AT ETON SINCE THIS ANTI-TOBACCONIST MARTYR RECEIVED HIS WHIPPING
THEY SOLD MANY THINGS BESIDES COFFEE AND SERVED A VARIETY OF PURPOSES BUT PRIMARILY THEY WERE TEMPLES OF TALK AND GOOD-FELLOWSHIP
NEITHER WALPOLE NOR ANY MEMBER OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HE LIVED WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE SMOKED
IN THIS SAME BOOK THACKERAY SAYS IRONICALLY--"THINK OF THAT DEN OF ABOMINATION WHICH I AM TOLD HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SOME CLUBS CALLED THE SMOKING-ROOM THE SATIRIST WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SMOKING-ROOM AT THE CLUB HE LOVED WELL--THE LITTLE G."--THE GARRICK
PRESENTLY HE PRODUCED A CLAY CHURCHWARDEN PIPE WHICH HE LIGHTED AND SOLEMNLY SMOKED AS HE WALKED PUTTING IT WHEN HE HAD DONE INTO A HOLE AMONG SOME TREE ROOTS AND TELLING MY FATHER THAT HE HAD A CACHE OF PIPES IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE PARISH TO MEET THE EXIGENCIES OF A SUDDEN DESIRE FOR TOBACCO IF THIS STORY DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LIFE OF AN ARCHBISHOP SOME SCEPTICISM ON THE PART OF THE READER MIGHT BE EXCUSED
THOUGH IT IS REALLY FOUNDED ON AND TO NO SMALL EXTENT TAKEN FROM SOME VERSES IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO WRITTEN BY SAMUEL ROWLANDS IN HIS KNAVE OF CLUBS 1611
IN SEPTEMBER 1639 HE SPENT 2D
OTHER PROFESSIONAL MEN SMOKED--WE READ IN FIELDING'S AMELIA OF A DOCTOR WHO IN THE EVENING SMOKED HIS PILLOW-PIPE AS THE PHRASE IS"--AND AMONG THE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF EQUAL OR LOWER SOCIAL STANDING SMOKING WAS AS GENERALLY PRACTISED AS IN THE PRECEDING CENTURY
I HAVE LEFT SIR FRANCIS BURDETT ON HIS LEGS HE WROTE AND REPAIRED TO THE SMOKING-ROOM
THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHYLACTIC POWER OF TOBACCO WAS HOWEVER VERY GENERALLY HELD
ACCORDING TO HIS IDEA CONTINUED THE PROFESSOR EVERY GERMAN HAS THREE NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS SMOKING SINGING AND SABBATH-BREAKING
IT IS QUITE LIKELY IF NOT HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE REVIVAL OF SMOKING IN THE SHAPE OF THE CIGAR WAS DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF BRITISH OFFICERS IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL DURING THE PENINSULAR WAR
AS IN OTHER PERIODS MEN OF LETTERS AND ARTISTS IGNORED THE SOCIAL PREJUDICES AND CONVENTIONS ABOUT TOBACCO AND LAUGHED AT THE ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTIONS DRAWN BETWEEN CIGARS AND PIPES
BURTON BELIEVED IN TOBACCO AS MEDICINE
WHY
ROSSETTI HAD A TEMPORARY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE POET AND IN THE REMINISCENCES WHICH HE PUBLISHED IN 1906 HE TOLD A CURIOUS ANECDOTE CONCERNING HIM WHICH WAS NEW TO PRINT
UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE USE OF CIGARS WAS PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY
CROMWELL ATTACKED THE ROYAL ARMY WITH THE MOST DISASTROUS RESULTS TO THE KING'S CAUSE
FARMER'S SILVER TOBACCO-PIPE IS STILL PRESERVED IN HIS OLD COLLEGE WHILE PORSON'S JAPANNED SNUFF-BOX IS AT TRINITY
THIS NEW SMOKING-ROOM IS A VERY HANDSOME LARGELY BOOK-LINED APARTMENT
HAYNE'S DIARY CONTAINS ONE OR TWO ENTRIES RELATING TO SMOKERS REQUISITES
THERE IS ALSO OF COURSE AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN A FOURTH CLASS OF MEN WHO FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER QUITE APART FROM WHAT FASHION MAY SAY OR DO DO NOT SMOKE AT ALL
PRYNNE IN HIS ATTACK ON THE STAGE DECLARED THAT WOMEN SMOKED PIPES IN THEATRES
GODLEY IN HIS OXFORD IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY GIVES AN EXCELLENT ENGLISH VERSION OF THE LATIN ORIGINAL OF ONE OF THE CHRIST CHURCH CARMINA QUADRAGESMALIA WHICH AFFORDS MUCH THE SAME PICTURE OF THE DAILY LIFE OF AN OXFORD FELLOW IN THE DAYS WHEN GEORGE I WAS KING
THE BALLADS OF THE PERIOD ABOUND IN ROUGH WOODCUTS IN WHICH TAVERN SCENES ARE OFTEN FIGURED WHEREIN PEWTER POTS AND TOBACCO-PIPES ARE SHOWN LYING ON THE TABLE OR IN THE HANDS OR AT THE MOUTHS OF THE MALE CAROUSERS
PA ARE YOU GOING TO SMOKE
THIS IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AND QUOTED AS BY FAIRHOLT AS IF IT WERE A WHOLE-HEARTED DEFENCE OF TOBACCO-TAKING
AT ANOTHER INN A COUNTRY SQUIRE IS DISCOVERED SMOKING HIS PIPE BY THE DOOR AND THE PARSON PROMPTLY JOINS HIM
THE NON-SMOKERS WERE THE MEN OF FASHION AND THOSE WHO FOLLOWED THEM IN PREFERRING THE SNUFF-BOX TO THE PIPE
WHO WHEN AGEN THE NIGHT RETURNS WHEN AGEN THE TAPER BURNS
SIGNS IN THEIR EARLY DAYS WERE NO DOUBT CHOSEN TO INTIMATE THE TRADES OF THOSE WHO USED THEM AND IN THE EASY-GOING OLD-FASHIONED DAYS WHEN IT WAS CONSIDERED THE RIGHT AND NATURAL THING FOR A SON TO BE BROUGHT UP TO HIS FATHER'S TRADE AND TO SUCCEED HIM THEREIN THEY LONG REMAINED APPROPRIATE AND INTELLIGIBLE
HE WAS VERY TALL MEAGRE AND YELLOW WITH A LONG HOOKED NOSE AND TWINKLING EYES
1691
THEN SHE SCREAMS WERY LOUD AND FALLS INTO STERICS
THERE WERE THE LONG CLAYS OR CHURCHWARDENS TO BE SMOKED IN HOURS OF EASE AND LEISURE
HE HAILS THE PIPE AS THE WORK OF PAN AND THE DIVINE SMOKE AS THE BEST AND MOST FRAGRANT OF GIFTS--HEALER OF SORROW COMPANION IN JOY REST FOR THE TOILERS DRINK FOR THE THIRSTY WARMTH FOR THE COLD COOLNESS IN THE HEAT AND A CHEAP FEAST FOR THOSE WHO WASTE AWAY THROUGH HUNGER
THOU ART INDEED THE DRUG A GARDENER WANTS TO POISON VERMIN THAT INFEST HIS PLANTS BUT ARE WE SO TO WIT AND BEAUTY BLIND AS TO DESPISE THE GLORY OF OUR KIND AND SHOW THE SOFTEST MINDS AND FAIREST FORMS AS LITTLE MERCY AS THE GRUBS AND WORMS NOTWITHSTANDING THIS SATIRIC WIPE IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT COWPER WOULD HAVE HAD MUCH SYMPATHY WITH JOHN WESLEY WHO IN HIS DETESTATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER'S SOLACE AT EPWORTH FORBADE HIS PREACHERS EITHER TO SMOKE OR TO TAKE SNUFF
ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT OF THE SAME JOURNAL COLONEL W.F
FROM A LETTER TO THE REV
HIS HIGHNESS ANSWERED WEE WILL CHARGE THEM TO-MORROW MORNINGE MY LORD ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WERE SURE THE ENIMY WOULD NOT FALL ON THEM SOONER
THE ANNOUNCEMENT CREATED NO SMALL STIR AND IT WAS SAID THAT THE OFFERS FOR THE HIGHLANDER RAN UP TO A SURPRISING FIGURE
ARE THEY NOT OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE GENERAL WANT OF THE AGE IN SPITE OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE OLD WOMEN ON THE COMMITTEES
THE MAPLE BLOCK WAS IN CONSTANT USE IN THOSE DAYS WHEN THE MANY PRESENT FORMS OF PREPARED TOBACCO AND VARIED MIXTURES WERE UNKNOWN
AS REGARDS THIS ROOM THE PROFESSOR DRILY REMARKED--"I THOUGHT I HAD NOTICED THAT EVEN THE KEY-HOLE WAS STOPPED UP IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE LADIES DELICATE NERVES FROM EVERY DISAGREEABLE SENSATION AFTER DINNER AGAIN WHEN THE LADIES HAD LEFT THE TABLE THE GENTLEMEN PASSED THE BOTTLES OF PORT SHERRY AND CLARET WITH THE REGULARITY OF PLANETS FROM HAND TO HAND BUT NO ONE DREAMED OF SMOKING
WELL DO I REMEMBER THE IMMENSE CARE WHICH DEVOTEES OF TOBACCO USED TO TAKE WHEN SALLYING FORTH IN THE COUNTRY TO ENJOY IT NOT TO ALLOW THE FAINTEST WHIFF OF SMOKE TO PENETRATE INTO THE HALL AS THEY LIT THEIR CIGARS AT THE DOOR IN 1845 DICKENS WROTE
COX IN HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF OXFORD 1868 OFTEN ADJOURNED TO SMOKE THEIR PIPE IN A LITTLE ROOM OPPOSITE TO THE SENIOR COMMON-ROOM NOW APPROPRIATED TO OTHER USES BUT THEN KEPT AS A SMOKING-ROOM A MR RHODES A ONE-TIME FELLOW OF WORCESTER COLLEGE WHO WAS ELECTED ESQUIRE BEDEL IN MEDICINE AND ARTS IN 1792 HAD A VERY PECULIAR WAY OF ENJOYING HIS TOBACCO
TRICKERY OF ANOTHER KIND IS REVEALED IN A SCENE IN CHAPMAN'S PLAY A HUMOROUS DAY'S MIRTH 1599
IT IS TRUE THAT AS THE SMOKE-WREATHS RING THEMSELVES ABOVE HIS HEAD HIS MIND MAY WANDER OFF INTO DEVIOUS PATHS OF REVERIE AND THE PROBLEM BE UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
THE ARM-CHAIR IN WHICH HOGARTH WAS WONT TO SIT AND SMOKE IS STILL PRESERVED IN HIS HOUSE AT CHISWICK WHICH HAS BEEN BOUGHT AND PRESERVED AS A MEMORIAL OF THE MORALIST-PAINTER
IT HAS EVEN BECOME USUAL FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO SMOKE IN COMMITTEE ROOMS WHEN THE SITTING IS PRIVATE
AFTER HIS MAJESTY HAD SPOKEN ONE LEARNED DOCTOR CHEYNELL WHO IS DESCRIBED BY THE RECORDER ISAAC WAKE THE PUBLIC ORATOR OF THE UNIVERSITY AS SECOND TO NONE OF THE DOCTORS HAD THE COURAGE TO RISE AND WITH A PIPE HELD FORTH IN HIS HAND TO SPEAK BOTH WITTILY AND ELOQUENTLY IN FAVOUR OF TOBACCO FROM THE MEDICINAL POINT OF VIEW PRAISING IT TO THE SKIES SAYS WAKE AS OF VIRTUE BEYOND ALL OTHER REMEDIAL AGENTS
DODSLEY'S COLLECTION CONTAINS A SATIRICAL POEM CALLED A PIPE OF TOBACCO WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN IMITATION OF SIX DIFFERENT POETS
THE WOMEN OF DEVONSHIRE AND CORNWALL WONDER THAT THE WOMEN OF MIDDLESEX DO NOT TAKE TABACCO
CIGARETTES WERE PERHAPS IN FASHION IN 1870
THE LETTER STATES THAT TOBACCO WAS USED ON ITS FIRST INTRODUCTION AS A MEDICINE BUT HAD SINCE BEEN SO LARGELY INDULGED IN AND WAS FREQUENTLY OF SUCH BAD QUALITY AS NOT ONLY TO INJURE THE HEALTH BUT DEPRAVE THE MORALS OF THE KING'S SUBJECTS
DUDLEY THE FOURTH LORD NORTH BEGAN TO SMOKE IN 1657 AND SAYS DR JESSOPP THE HABIT GREW UPON HIM THE FREQUENT ENTRIES FOR PIPES AND TOBACCO SHOWING THAT HE BECAME MORE AND MORE ADDICTED TO THIS INDULGENCE
THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY EXTRAORDINARY MEDICINAL VIRTUES CONTINUED TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIVINE WEED IN SOME LETTERS OF THE APPLETON FAMILY PRINTED SOME TIME AGO FROM THE ORIGINALS IN THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY THERE IS A CURIOUS LETTER UNDATED BUT OF 1652 OR 1653 FROM SUSAN CRANE THE WIDOW OF SIR ROBERT CRANE WHO WAS THE SECOND WIFE OF ISAAC APPLETON OF BUCKMAN VALL NORFOLK
GENERAL MONK TO WHOM CHARLES II OWED SO MUCH IS SAID TO HAVE INDULGED IN THE UNPLEASANT HABIT OF CHEWING TOBACCO AND TO HAVE BEEN IMITATED BY OTHERS
AT THE COFFEE-HOUSE ENTRANCE WAS THE BAR PRESIDED OVER BY THE PREDECESSORS OF THE MODERN BARMAIDS--GRUMBLED AT IN A SPECTATOR AS IDOLS WHO THERE RECEIVED HOMAGE FROM THEIR ADMIRERS AND WHO PAID MORE ATTENTION TO CUSTOMERS WHO FLIRTED WITH THEM THAN TO MORE SOBER-MINDED VISITORS
IT IS OF COURSE WELL KNOWN THAT AUSTRIAN AND RUSSIAN LADIES GENERALLY ARE FOND OF CIGARETTE-SMOKING
A MAN DOESN'T GET DELIRIUM TREMENS EVEN IF HE SMOKES MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR HIM
LADIES WHEN PIPES ARE BROUGHT AFFECT TO SWOON
LADIES WHEN PIPES ARE BROUGHT AFFECT TO SWOON
THERE IS NO ORIGINAL AUTHORITY HOWEVER FOR THE STATEMENT THAT LANE FIRST SMOKED TOBACCO IN ENGLAND AND MOREOVER HE WAS NOT THE FIRST ENGLISH VISITOR TO VIRGINIA TO RETURN TO THIS COUNTRY
HIS PRACTICE WAS TO SNUFF UP CUT AND DRIED TOBACCO WHICH WAS SOMETIMES JUST COLOURED WITH SPANISH SNUFF
BUT BY THE CLOSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY MOST OF THE OLD TRADE SIGNS WHICH FLAUNTED THEMSELVES IN THE STREETS HAD DISAPPEARED
TIS NOT SO GOOD NOW AS I TOOK IT FOR ANOTHER WRITER OF THIS TIME SPEAKS OF ONE PIPE OF TOBACCO SUFFICING THREE OR FOUR MEN AT ONCE THE RICH YOUNG GALLANT CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM HIS TOBACCO APPARATUS OFTEN OF GOLD OR SILVER IN THE FORM OF TOBACCO-BOX TOBACCO-TONGS--WHEREWITH TO LIFT A LIVE COAL TO LIGHT HIS PIPE LADLE FOR THE COLD SNUFFE INTO THE NOSTHRILL AND PRIMING-IRON
LEECH HAD A PICTURE OF A QUIET SMOKE IN PUNCH WHICH DEPICTED FIVE LADIES IN SHORT WIDE SKIRTS AND BLOOMERS IN A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP TWO SMOKING CIGARS AND ONE A PIPE WHILE ONE OF THE INFERIOR ANIMALS BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS SELLING TOBACCO
THE INDIAN WEED RETAINED ITS EMPIRE OVER THE MEN AND WOMEN OF FASHION BY CHANGING ITS FORM
IN THE RECORD OF AN EARLY LIBEL ACTION BROUGHT IN THE COURT OF THE ARCHDEACON OF ESSEX SOME DOMESTIC SCENES OF 1621 ARE VIVIDLY REPRESENTED
OLD DOCTOR PORTMAN MEETS THEM AND REGARDS WITH WONDER PEN'S FRIEND FROM WHOSE MOUTH AND CIGAR CLOUDS OF FRAGRANCE ISSUED WHICH CURLED ROUND THE DOCTOR'S HONEST FACE AND SHOVEL HAT
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BY CIGARETTES DICKENS MEANT NOT WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS SUCH BUT SIMPLY SMALL CIGARS
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT OF SMOKING IN WHAT HOUSE-AGENTS CALL THE RECEPTION-ROOMS THE PRINCIPAL REASON BEING THAT THE OCCUPATION OF THESE ROOMS WAS SHARED BY LADIES AND IT WAS BAD FORM NOT BY THE WAY A CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSION TO SMOKE WHILE IN THE COMPANY OF THE FAIRER HALF OF CREATION
IT WAS IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HIS LIFE THAT TENNYSON TOLD SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT ONE DAY THAT HIS MORNING PIPE AFTER BREAKFAST WAS THE BEST IN THE DAY--AN OPINION BY THE WAY TO WHICH MANY LESS DISTINGUISHED SMOKERS WOULD SUBSCRIBE--WHEN SIR WILLIAM LAUGHINGLY REPLIED THE EARLIEST PIPE OF HALF-AWAKENED BARDS THE COMPANION BURLESQUE LINE THE EARLIEST PIPE OF HALF-AWAKENED BIRDSEYE APPEARS WITH ONE FROM HOMER AND ONE FROM VIRGIL AT THE HEAD OF ARTHUR SIDGWICK'S POEM IN GREEK IAMBICS +TO BAKCHO+ IN ECHOES FROM THE OXFORD MAGAZINE 1890
MEN SMOKE NOWADAYS WHILST THEY ARE OCCUPIED IN WORKING OR HUNTING RIDING IN CARRIAGES OR OTHERWISE EMPLOYED"--WHICH SHOWS HOW THE PREJUDICE AGAINST OUTDOOR SMOKING WAS THEN BREAKING DOWN
THEY SPEAK OF IT AS OF SOME SECRET AWFUL VICE THAT SEIZES UPON A MAN AND MAKES HIM A PARIAH FROM GENTEEL SOCIETY
THE BUTLER THEN APPEARED AND UNDERTOOK TO PROVIDE KNIVES SALT PEPPER-POTS GLASSES SAUCES C AND EVERYTHING NEEDFULL FOR L7
IN THE INVENTORY OF ALL HIS CATTALLES AND GOODS WHICH IS DATED 24 JANUARY 1624 THERE IS INCLUDED IT
IT STILL RETAINS TWO OF THE OLD GAMING TABLES
EVERY THIRD WINDOW IS A PIPE-SHOP AND THEY PRESUMABLY THE PIPES SHOW BY THEIR SPLENDOUR AND VARIETY THE EXPENSIVENESS OF THE PASSION
THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
568 OF THE SPECTATOR
IN MORE FASHIONABLE CIRCLES THE MERE POSSESSION OF A PIPE MIGHT BE LOOKED AT ASKANCE
IT HATH SINGULAR AND CONTRARY EFFECTS IT IS GOOD TO WARM ONE BEING COLD AND WILL COOL ONE BEING HOT
AND CIGARS AND CIGARETTES AND PIPES ARE NOW LIGHTED IN THE LOBBY THE MOMENT THAT THE HOUSE HAS RISEN
O NYMPH OF TRANSATLANTIC FAME WHERE'ER THINE HAUNT WHATE'ER THY NAME WHETHER REPOSING ON THE SIDE OF ORONOCO'S SPACIOUS TIDE OR LISTENING WITH DELIGHT NOT SMALL TO NIAGARA'S DISTANT FALL TIS THINE TO CHERISH AND TO FEED THE PUNGENT NOSE-REFRESHING WEED WHICH WHETHER PULVERIZED IT GAIN A SPEEDY PASSAGE TO THE BRAIN OR WHETHER TOUCHED WITH FIRE IT RISE IN CIRCLING EDDIES TO THE SKIES DOES THOUGHT MORE QUICKEN AND REFINE THAN ALL THE BREATH OF ALL THE NINE FORGIVE THE BARD IF BARD HE BE WHO ONCE TOO WANTONLY MADE FREE TO TOUCH WITH A SATIRIC WIPE THAT SYMBOL OF THY POWER THE PIPE

LE BRETON HOWEVER IN HIS BOOK ON BALZAC--"L'HOMME ET L'OEUVRE"--SAYS
BUT ONE CANNOT HELP FANCYING THAT THE ARCHDEACON'S MEMORY WAS NOT QUITE TRUSTWORTHY
THE COURT-BOOKS OF THE MANOR OF METHWOLD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING ENTRY MADE AT A COURT HELD ON OCTOBER 4 1695
UNTIL AT THE PRESENT DAY TOBACCO-SMOKING IN ENGLAND--BY PIPE OR CIGAR OR CIGARETTE--IS MORE GENERAL MORE CONTINUOUS AND MORE FREE FROM CONVENTIONAL RESTRICTIONS THAN AT ANY PERIOD SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF ITS TRIUMPH IN THE FIRST DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
WE GET A CURIOUS GLIMPSE OF ONE ASPECT OF LIFE THERE IN THE PICTURE WHICH LILLY THE NOTORIOUS ASTROLOGER PAINTS IN HIS STORY OF HIS ARREST IN JANUARY 1661
THE ARCHDEACON WAS WRITING FROM MEMORY--A VERY UNTRUSTWORTHY RECORDER
I HAVE MY THREE SORTS OF TOBACCO IN MY POCKET MY LIGHT BY ME AND THUS I BEGIN
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE A MEMBER OF A CERTAIN CLUB IN THIS CITY WHERE IT IS A STANDING ORDER THAT THE PAPER CALLED THE WORLD BE CONSTANTLY BROUGHT UPON THE TABLE WITH CLEAN GLASSES PIPES AND TOBACCO EVERY THURSDAY AFTER DINNER THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN OF THE TIME FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS AND ENJOYED RURAL SPORTS OF ALL KINDS DRANK ALE AND SMOKED TOBACCO
THIS WAS MADE CLEAR I THINK BY THE LATE DR BRUSHFIELD IN THE SECOND OF THE VALUABLE PAPERS ON MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF SIR WALTER WHICH HE CONTRIBUTED UNDER THE TITLE OF RALEGHANA TO THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE DEVONSHIRE ASSOCIATION
AND DEVONSHIRE GUIDE-BOOKS HAVE ADOPTED THE STORY
PORSON WHEN ASKED FOR AN INSCRIPTION FOR THE BOX SUGGESTED +TO BAKCHO+ PRYME SAYS THAT AMONG THE UNDERGRADUATES OF WHOM HE WAS ONE TOBACCO HAD NO FAVOUR AND AN ATTEMPT OF MR GINKELL SON OF LORD ATHLONE
IN A WORLD OF 1755 THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF A NOISY HEARTY DRINKING DEVIL-MAY-CARE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN IN WHICH IT IS SAID HE MAKES NO SCRUPLE TO TAKE HIS PIPE AND POT AT AN ALEHOUSE WITH THE VERY DREGS OF THE PEOPLE IN A CONNOISSEUR OF 1754 A FINE GENTLEMAN FROM LONDON MAKING A VISIT IN A COUNTRY-HOUSE IS TAKING HIS BREAKFAST WITH THE LADIES IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THEY HAD THEIR TEA FOR SAYS HE I SHOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE PERISHED HAD I STAIED IN THE HALL AMIDST THE JARGON OF TOASTS AND THE FUMES OF TOBACCO WHEN HORACE WALPOLE WAS STAYING WITH HIS FATHER AT HIS NORFOLK COUNTRY-SEAT HOUGHTON IN SEPTEMBER 1737 GRAY WROTE TO HIM FROM CAMBRIDGE
A HEAD
BUT WHAT MAY BE MEANT BY THE CUBAN EBOLITION OR THE EURIPUS IS PERHAPS BEST LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION
THE COLONEL WRITES
ALSO A DAUGHTER
BEFORE DINNER AFTER TAKING A FEW TURNS UP AND DOWN PAUL'S WALK IN THE OLD CATHEDRAL HE MIGHT LOOK INTO THE BOOKSELLERS SHOPS AND PIPE IN MOUTH INQUIRE FOR THE MOST RECENT ATTACK UPON THE DIVINE WEED"--THE CONTEMPORARY TOBACCO LITERATURE WAS ABUNDANT--OR DROP INTO AN APOTHECARY'S WHICH WAS USUALLY A TOBACCO-SHOP ALSO AND THERE MEET HIS FELLOW-SMOKERS
THE MOST FAMOUS OF COUNTRY CLERGYMEN OF THE EARLY GEORGIAN PERIOD IS OF COURSE FIELDING'S LOVABLE AND IMMORTAL PARSON ADAMS
THE EARLIEST REFERENCES FOR THE WORD CIGARETTE IN THE OXFORD DICTIONARY ARE DATED 1842 AND 1843 BUT BOTH REFER TO THE SMOKING OF CIGARETTES ABROAD--IN FRANCE AND ITALY
AND NEXT THE ABSURD CUSTOM BY WHICH YOUNG TRADESMEN AT THEIR FIRST STARTING IN BUSINESS ADDED THEIR OWN SIGNS TO THOSE OF THE MASTERS UNDER WHOM THEY HAD SERVED THEIR APPRENTICESHIP
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS HE SENT CARLYLE--AN INVETERATE SMOKER--A BOX OF CIGARS IN FEBRUARY 1865
BUT SMOKING IS NOT MENTIONED AND IT IS QUITE CERTAIN FROM WILLIS'S SILENCE ON THE SUBJECT--THE DISGUSTING ODOUR WOULD SURELY HAVE DISTURBED HIM--THAT NO SINGLE MEMBER OF THE LARGE DINNER-PARTY DREAMED OF SMOKING OR AT ALL EVENTS ATTEMPTED TO SMOKE
ABRAHAM DE LA PRYME NOTES IN HIS DIARY FOR THE YEAR 1694 THAT WHEN IT WAS RUMOURED IN MAY OF THAT YEAR THAT A CERTAIN HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE OF THE COLLEGES WAS HAUNTED STRANGE NOISES BEING HEARD IN IT SEVERAL SCHOLARS OF THE COLLEGE SAID COME FETCH US A GOOD PITCHER OF ALE AND TOBACCO AND PIPES AND WEE'L SIT UP AND SEE THIS SPIRIT THE ALE WAS DULY PROVIDED THE PIPES WERE LIT AND THE COURAGEOUS SMOKERS SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE HOUSE SITTING SINGING AND DRINKING THERE TILL MORNING BUT ALAS
WINSTANLEY WHO WAS AN ENEMY OF WHAT HE CALLED THIS HEATHENISH WEED AND WHO THOUGHT THE FOLLY OF SMOKING MIGHT NEVER HAVE SPREAD SO MUCH IF STRINGENT MEANS OF PREVENTION HAD BEEN EXERCISED YET HAD TO DECLARE IN 1660 THAT TOBACCO IT SELF IS BY FEW TAKEN NOW AS MEDICINAL IT IS GROWN A GOOD-FELLOW AND FALLEN FROM A PHYSICIAN TO A COMPLEMENT
SOME FOR WANTOWNESSE OR RATHER FASHION SAKE AND OTHER FOR HEALTH SAKE INSOMUCH THAT TOBACCO SHOPS ARE SET UP IN GREATER NUMBER THAN EITHER ALEHOUSES OR TAVERNES ONE RESULT OF THE HERB'S POPULARITY WAS FOUND IN FREQUENT ATTEMPTS BY TRADESMEN OF VARIOUS KINDS TO SELL IT WITHOUT BEING DULY LICENSED TO DO SO
THE ORDINARY SORT MADE USE OF A WALNUT SHELL AND A STRAW"--SURELY A VERY UNSATISFACTORY PIPE
BUT HER PIPE SHE WAS BOUND TO HAVE AND SO MET HER END
THEIR HEARSES I UNDERSTAND ARE WAITING TO TAKE THEM BACK THERE THE MOTION FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE FACILITIES FOR SMOKING WAS DEFEATED BY A MAJORITY OF TWENTY-THREE VOTES AND AS AN INDIRECT RESULT THE MARLBOROUGH CLUB WAS FOUNDED

THE USE OF IT BY SO MANIE OF LATE MEN AND WOMEN OF GREAT CALLING AS ELSE AND SOME LEARNED PHYSITIANS ALSO IS SUFFICIENT WITNESS WHO CAN DOUBT THAT HARIOT IN REPORTING DIRECT TO SIR WALTER RALEIGH SHOWED HIS EMPLOYER HOW TO SUCK IT AFTER THEIR MANER
BUCKMASTER IN HIS REMINISCENCES DESCRIBES THE FAMOUS DEBATING SOCIETY AT COGERS HALL AND SAYS THAT AFTER ONE NIGHT AT THE COGERS IT TOOK THREE DAYS ON A COMMON TO PURIFY YOUR CLOTHES FROM THE SMOKE
ANOTHER SURVIVOR MAY BE SEEN AT THE DOOR OF A SHOP BELONGING TO MESSRS

MINCING LANE 12 DEC
CAN'T IMAGINE
SHIRLEY BROOKS SAID THAT THIS ROOM WHICH WAS REACHED BY A LONG PASSAGE FROM THE STRANGERS DINING-ROOM WAS NOT A CHEERFUL APARTMENT BY DAYLIGHT AND WHEN EMPTY BUT WHICH AT NIGHT AND FULL WAS THOUGHT THE MOST CHEERFUL APARTMENT IN TOWN AT OTHER CLUBS OF MORE FASHION PERHAPS BUT CERTAINLY OF LESS GOOD-FELLOWSHIP SMOKING-ROOMS MADE THEIR WAY MORE SLOWLY
A FEATHER-HEADED GALLANT WHEN IN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES OFTEN FOUND HIMSELF LIKE OTHERS OF HIS TRIBE OF LATER DATE GRAVELLED FOR LACK OF MATTER FOR CONVERSATION AND THE PUFFING OF TOBACCO-SMOKE HELPED TO OCCUPY THE PAUSES
SIR FRANCIS VERE IN THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SERVICES BY SEA AND LAND WHICH HE WROTE ABOUT 1606 MENTIONS THAT ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE AZORES IN 1597 THE EARL OF ESSEX WAITING FOR NEWS OF THE ENEMY AT ST MICHAEL CALLED FOR TOBACCO
ACCORDING TO THIS YARN SIR WALTER USUALLY INDULGED HIMSELF IN SMOAKING SECRETLY TWO PIPES A DAY
THE LATE DUC D'AUMALE WAS A SOCIAL PIONEER IN PIPE-SMOKING
TO FANCY TO ESCAPE DETECTION BY HIDING AROUND THE CORNER OF THE CHURCH
BUT I KNOW OF NO AUTHORITY FOR THIS WIDER STATEMENT
PREPARATIONS WERE DULY MADE TO RECEIVE HIM
THE SAME IDEA RUNS THROUGH THE ALLUSIONS TO TOBACCO IN PICKWICK SMOKING WAS UNDENIABLY VULGAR
YOUNG MEN NEVER SMOKED AT ALL
IN THE CONNOISSEUR OF GEORGE COLMAN AND BONNELL THORNTON FOR INSTANCE THERE IS IN 1754 THE DESCRIPTION OF A CITIZEN'S SUNDAY
THE WORLD MAY WAG AT WILL SO I HAVE MY CIGAR
BUT A SMOKE IN THE BILLIARD-ROOM WAS ONLY ALLOWED IF THAT ROOM WAS NOT NEAR THE DRAWING-ROOM OR IN THE HALL CLOSE BY
FOUR YARMOUTH MEN--OLD SEA-DOGS PERHAPS WHO LOVED THEIR PIPE--WERE IN 1687 FINED 4S
SMOKING WAS UNIVERSAL AMONG THEIR MALE PARISHIONERS FROM THE SQUIRE TO THE LABOURER WHEN HE COULD AFFORD IT SO THAT IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE PARSON WITH LITTLE TO DO AND IN THOSE DAYS NOT TOO MUCH INCLINATION TO DO IT SHOULD BE AS FOND OF HIS PIPE AS THE REST OF THE WORLD AROUND HIM
AND THAT WHEN THEY GAVE THEIR VOTES CONDEMNING THE TWO EARLS THEY WERE STUPID WITH EATING AND YVRES DE TABAC"--DRUNK WITH SMOKING
THEN TO KNOW ALL THE DELICATE SWEET FORMS FOR THE ASSUMPTION OF IT
BUT THESE WERE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF PURITAN FEELING ON THE SUBJECT
THE FRENCH NOVELIST SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE WHO PRAISED TOBACCO WITHOUT USING IT MUCH HIMSELF
AND SO ON AND SO ON
WELL SIR HE WROTE IN DUE COURSE WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND THERE WE WERE JOINED BY AN AMERICAN LADY RESIDING IN THE SAME HOTEL
IN THE AFTERNOON THE GALLANT MIGHT ATTEND WHAT DEKKER CALLS A TOBACCO-ORDINARY BY WHICH MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN MEANT A SMOKING-CLUB OR MORE PROBABLY THE GATHERING AFTER DINNER AT ONE OF THE MANY ORDINARIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ST PAUL'S CATHEDRAL OF TOBACCONISTS AS SMOKERS WERE THEN CALLED TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PIPES AND OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TOBACCO--"WHETHER YOUR CANE OR YOUR PUDDING BE SWEETEST OF COURSE HE OFTEN BRAGGED LIKE JULIO IN DAY'S LAW TRICKES
BURN IN HIS DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF LONDON TOKENS WRITES
THE ATTRACTIONS AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF PROVINCIAL COFFEE-HOUSES WERE MUCH THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE LONDON RESORTS
MR HERBERT PAUL IN HIS PAPER ON THE BISHOP SAYS THAT THOSE WHO WENT TO SEE HIM AT FULHAM ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON ALWAYS FOUND HIM IF THEY FOUND HIM AT ALL LEISURELY CHATTY HOSPITABLE AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT A CARE IN THE WORLD
HE SHOULD BE WELL EXPERIENC'D IN THE WORLD
HIS HEAD WAS CASED IN A WOOLLEN NIGHTCAP OVER WHICH HE WORE A FLAPPED HAT
BUT EVEN THIS WAS NOT ALL
THESE ARE HIS TERMS AND THESE FEW LINES IT MAY BE ADDED GIVE A GRAPHIC PICTURE OF PORSON
MORE THAN ONE WRITER OF RECENT DAYS HAS ABSURDLY MISREPRESENTED JOHNSON AS A SMOKER
TO SMOKE IN HYDE PARK SAID THE LATE LADY DOROTHY NEVILL IN 1907 EVEN UP TO COMPARATIVELY RECENT YEARS WAS LOOKED UPON AS ABSOLUTELY UNPARDONABLE WHILE SMOKING ANYWHERE WITH A LADY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSED AS AN ALMOST DISGRACEFUL SOCIAL CRIME WOMEN DO NOT NOWADAYS SHUN THE SMELL OF SMOKE AS THEY DID IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AS IF IT WERE THE MOST DREADFUL OF ODOURS
LATER AS WE SHALL SEE THEY BECAME MEANINGLESS IN MANY CASES
BUT THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE HAD MUCH EFFECT

WE ARE MASHERS WE ARE AS WE SMOKE OUR CIGAR AND CRAWL ALONG NEVER TOO QUICK
OLD ENGLISH CLAYS SAYS MR T.P
THE CLAY PIPES CALLED ALDERMEN WITH LONGER STEMS THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS TIPPED WITH GLAZE CAME INTO USE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
ALL THE DANDIES OF THE PERIOD WERE CONNOISSEURS OF SNUFF AND IMITATED THE ROYAL MIRROR OF FASHION IN THEIR DEVOTION TO THE SCENTED POWDER
WRITING FROM BOULOGNE TO W.H
WHEN OUR GALLANT WENT TO DINE AT THE ORDINARY ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE TIME HE BROUGHT OUT THESE POSSESSIONS AND SMOKED WHILE THE DINNER WAS BEING SERVED
THE EARLY TRAVELLERS DID SMOKE FOR THEODORE HOOK SATIRIZING THEM AND THE CLUB RULE THAT NO PERSON WAS ELIGIBLE AS A MEMBER WHO HAD NOT TRAVELLED OUT OF THE BRITISH ISLANDS TO A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST 500 MILES FROM LONDON IN A DIRECT LINE WROTE
I SHOWED NO ATOM OF SURPRISE BUT I NEVER WAS SO SURPRISED SO RIDICULOUSLY TAKEN ABACK IN MY LIFE
BESIDES A FEW OLD FARMERS CHURCHWARDENS AND OVERSEERS AND SUCH NOBODY THEN EVER SMOKED BUT LABOURERS AND THE LOWER ORDERS--CADS AS YOU NOW SAY
I HAVE BEEN UNABLE HOWEVER TO FIND EVIDENCE OF SUCH A PROLONGED PERIOD OF FAVOUR
A BURLESQUE POEM OF 1853 IN PRAISE OF AN OLD BLACK PIPE SAYS
WHILE WE ARE IN THE EASTERN COUNTIES WE MAY NOTE THAT IN 1694 THERE DIED AT ELY AN APOTHECARY NAMED HENRY CROFTS WHO OWNED AMONG SOME OTHER UNUSUAL ITEMS IN HIS INVENTORY CASKS OF BRANDY AND TOBACCO WHICH SHOWS THAT EVEN AT THAT DATE WHEN REGULAR TOBACCONISTS SHOPS FOR THE SALE OF TOBACCO HAD LONG BEEN COMMON THE OLD BUSINESS CONNEXION BETWEEN APOTHECARIES AND TOBACCO STILL OCCASIONALLY EXISTED
HE WAS SITTING WITH MY FATHER IN THE TWILIGHT AFTER SOME FAMILY MEAL IN THE OLD HOUSE IN KENSINGTON THACKERAY WAS A CIGAR-SMOKER BUT TENNYSON WAS A DEVOTEE OF THE PIPE
HE WAS THE SON OF AN IRISH EARL AND AN ATTACHE AT OUR EMBASSY IN PARIS
TOM BROWN OFTEN DUBBED THE FACETIOUS BUT TO WHOM A STERNER EPITHET MIGHT WELL BE APPLIED WRITING ABOUT THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY MENTIONS A VINTNER'S WIFE WHO HAVING MADE HER PILE AS MIGHT BE SAID NOWADAYS RETIRES TO A LITTLE COUNTRY-HOUSE AT HAMPSTEAD WHERE SHE DRINKS SACK TOO PLENTIFULLY SMOKES TOBACCO IN AN ELBOW-CHAIR AND SNORES AWAY THE REMAINDER OF HER LIFE
ONE OF THE MOST CURIOUS OF THE EARLY PUBLICATIONS ON TOBACCO IN WHICH AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO HOLD THE BALANCE FAIRLY BETWEEN THE LEGITIMATE USE AND THE LICENTIOUS ABUSE OF THE HERB IS TOBIAS VENNER'S TRACT WITH THE LONG-WINDED TITLE
AND TOBACCO I DID NOT TAKE
1691 SUGGESTED THAT FRIENDS WERE NOT TO SMOKE DURING THEIR LABOUR OR OCCUPATION BUT TO LEAVE THEIR WORK AND TAKE IT PRIVATELY"--A SUGGESTION WHICH CLEARLY PROCEEDED FROM NON-SMOKERS
THE WAX CANDLE WAS OF COURSE A CONVENIENCE IN MATCHLESS DAYS FOR PIPE-LIGHTING
A PAMPHLETEER OF 1609 SAYS
HE CAME HOME VERY SMOKY AND DRINKY LAST NIGHT SAYS HIS SISTER OF HIM
THE OTHER WAS IMPORTED FROM ENGLISH COLONIES--CHIEFLY FROM VIRGINIA
FOR EACH OFFENCE AND IN PORTSMOUTH NOT ONLY WERE FINED BUT TO THEIR SHAME BE IT TOLD SET AS JAIL-BIRDS IN THE PORTSMOUTH CAGE
BELOW ON HIS LEFT IS A LARGE JAR LABELLED VARNISH THE FIGURE OF TIME IS NUDE AND HAS LARGE WINGS
HE DID NOT SMOKE HIMSELF
BEHOLD THE MAN WHO WHEN A GLOOMY BAND OF VILE EXCISEMEN THREATENED ALL THE LAND HELP'D TO DELIVER FROM THEIR HARPY GRIPE THE CHEERFUL BOTTLE AND THE SOCIAL PIPE
AS THE POISON OF TOBACCO ACTS BUT FOR A SHORT TIME I AT LENGTH AWOKE FROM INSENSIBILITY AND LOOKED ROUND ON THE PARTY MY EYES DAZZLED BY THE CANDLES WHICH HAD BEEN LIGHTED IN THE INTERIM
PERHAPS THE BEST REFLECTION OF AND COMMENT UPON THE ATTITUDE OF SOCIETY TOWARDS SMOKING IS TO BE FOUND IN THE IRONICAL SATIRICAL PAGES OF THACKERAY
ANOTHER TRADITION GIVES THE OLD PIED BULL AT ISLINGTON LONG SINCE DEMOLISHED AS THE SCENE OF THE MOMENTOUS EVENT
WILLS IN SEPTEMBER 1854 DICKENS SAYS I HAVE NEARLY EXHAUSTED THE CIGARETTES I BROUGHT HERE AND PROCEEDS TO GIVE DIRECTIONS FOR SOME TO BE SENT TO HIM FROM LONDON
NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE LENGTH OF HIS DAYS TO THE REGULARITY OF HIS HABITS
ON RUSSIAN RAILWAYS IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND A COMPARTMENT LABELLED FOR LADIES WHO DO NOT SMOKE THE NEWSPAPERS REPORTED NOT LONG AGO FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC THAT THE SMART WOMEN OF CHICAGO HAD SUBSTITUTED CIGARS FOR CIGARETTES
AND AT INTERVALS THEREAFTER ADDITIONS WERE MADE TO AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT TO THE BOX AND ITS CASINGS

THE TOBACCO-PIPE WAS POPULAR AMONG EVERY SECTION OF SOCIETY IN THIS COUNTRY IN AN AMAZINGLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME AFTER SMOKING WAS FIRST PRACTISED FOR PLEASURE AND RETAINED ITS ASCENDANCY FOR NO INCONSIDERABLE PERIOD
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR-SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY

SOMETIMES SAYS ADDISON IN HIS TITLE CHARACTER IN THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE PAPER SOMETIMES I SMOAK A PIPE AT CHILD'S AND WHILST I SEEM ATTENTIVE TO NOTHING BUT THE POST-MAN OVER-HEAR THE CONVERSATION OF EVERY TABLE IN THE ROOM AND HERE IS A VIGNETTE OF COFFEE-HOUSE LIFE IN 1714 FROM NO
THERE HE SMOKES HALF A PIPE AND DRINKS A PINT OF ALE
THERE HAVE I SEEN TELL IT NOT TO THE WEST INDIANS BUXTON BLOWING FIRE OUT OF HIS MOUTH
SAT THE LUSTY COAL-HEAVERS QUAFFING LARGE DRAUGHTS OF BARCLAY'S BEST AND PUFFING FORTH VOLUMES OF SMOKE WHICH WREATHED HEAVILY ABOVE THEIR HEADS AND INVOLVED THE ROOM IN A THICK DARK CLOUD THESE GOOD FOLK AND OTHERS OF THEIR KIN HAD NEVER BEEN AFFECTED BY ANY CHANGE OF FASHION IN RESPECT OF SMOKING
THE WOODEN FIGURE OF A NEGRO OR INDIAN WITH GILT LOIN-CLOTH AND FEATHERED HEAD HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AS AN OLD TOBACCONIST'S SIGN
A SINGULAR FEATURE OF THE ENTHUSIASM FOR TOBACCO IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS THE EXISTENCE OF PROFESSORS OF THE ART OF SMOKING
A TOBACCO-PAPER DATING FROM ABOUT THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE BEARS RUDELY ENGRAVED THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO SMOKING AND HOLDING A ROLL OF TOBACCO IN HIS HAND
THIS DID NOT MUCH AFFECT ITS GENERAL USE
HE DIED IN 1863 AND SO HARDLY SAW THE BEGINNING OF A CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF SOCIETY TOWARDS THE PESTILENT WEED
THE PARSON OF THORNTON IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE WAS SO DEVOTED TO TOBACCO THAT WHEN HIS SUPPLY OF THE WEED RAN SHORT HE IS SAID TO HAVE CUT UP THE BELL-ROPES AND SMOKED THEM
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING BY THE USE OF PIPES CIGARS OR CHEROOTS HAS BECOME PREVALENT AMONG THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY WHICH IS NOT ONLY IN ITSELF A SPECIES OF INTOXICATION OCCASIONED BY THE FUMES OF TOBACCO BUT UNDOUBTEDLY OCCASIONS DRINKING AND TIPPLING BY THOSE WHO ACQUIRE THE HABIT
THIS FULSOME FEEDING CLOGGS THE BRAIN AND DOTH THE STOMACH CHOAK BUT HE'S A BRAVE SPARK THAT CAN DINE WITH ONE LIGHT DISH OF SMOAK THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT KING CHARLES SMOKED NOR WHAT HIS PERSONAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS TOBACCO MAY HAVE BEEN

IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THE POET HIMSELF IF HE HAD LEARNED TO SMOKE A SOCIAL PIPE WITH HIS FRIEND BULL
THOMAS DEKKER TO WHOSE PICTURES OF LONDON SOCIAL LIFE AT THE OPENING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WE ARE SO MUCH INDEBTED FOR INFORMATION BOTH WITH REGARD TO SMOKING AND IN RESPECT OF MANY OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST WAS HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF TOBACCO
ON A NEW SPRING TO HIS TOBACKA TONGES THESE WERE THE TONGS USED FOR LIFTING A LIVE COAL TO LIGHT THE PIPE TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED ON A PREVIOUS PAGE
IN CONNECTICUT A MAN WAS PERMITTED BY THE LAW TO SMOKE ONCE IF HE WENT ON A JOURNEY OF TEN MILES BUT NOT MORE THAN ONCE A DAY AND BY NO MEANS IN ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE
THE VARIATIONS IN PRICE OF BOTH SPANISH AND VIRGINIA TOBACCO WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE FREQUENT CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DUTY THEREON
JOHNSTONE PARR'S BIOGRAPHER REFERRING TO HIS HERO'S FAILURE TO OBTAIN PREFERMENT TO THE EPISCOPAL BENCH ABOUT THE YEAR 1804 SAYS--"HIS PIPE MIGHT BE DEEMED IN THESE FANTASTIC DAYS A DEGRADATION AT THE TABLE OF THE PALACE OR THE CASTLE
AT A DINNER WHICH WAS GIVEN AT TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE TO THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER AS CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY WHEN THE CLOTH WAS REMOVED PARR AT ONCE STARTED HIS PIPE AND BEGAN SAYS ONE WHO WAS PRESENT BLOWING A CLOUD INTO THE FACES OF HIS NEIGHBOURS MUCH TO THEIR ANNOYANCE AND CAUSING ROYALTY TO SNEEZE BY THE STIMULATING STENCH OF MUNDUNGUS IT IS SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH SUCH BAD MANNERS AS PARR WAS ACCUSTOMED TO EXHIBIT
OVER A PIPE IS A PHRASE OF MORE MEANING THAN OVER A CIGARETTE DISCUSSIONS ARE BEST CONDUCTED OVER A PIPE
THE CYCLE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS IS COMPLETE
CROKER IN 1831 COMMENTING ON JOHNSON'S SAYING THAT SMOKING HAD GONE OUT SAID
AND IN THE COURSE OF ITS SUCCESSOR SMOKING FELL MORE AND MORE UNDER THE BAN OF FASHION
THREE MEN'S HATS HANG ON PEGS ON THE WALL ALTOGETHER THIS IS AN INTERESTING AND SUGGESTIVE DESIGN BUT HARDLY IN THE TASTE LIKELY TO COMMEND ITSELF TO PRESENT DAY TRADESMEN
AS THIS IS THE ONLY REFERENCE TO TOBACCO IN THE WHOLE OF HIS DIARY IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THORESBY WAS HIMSELF A SMOKER
DEACON AS THE TITLE OF HIS BOOK JUST QUOTED SHOWS WAS VERY FOND OF ALLITERATION AND ONE SENTENCE OF HIS DIATRIBE MAY BE QUOTED
NEGATIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS KIND IS ABUNDANT
A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY DAYS TOWARDS TOBACCO MAY BE FOUND IN CONNEXION WITH RAILWAYS AND RAILWAY TRAVELLING
AND SEVERAL OF THE PEWS IN THE BODY OF THE CHURCH CONTAINED TRIANGULAR WOODEN SPITTOONS FILLED WITH SAWDUST
SIMILAR TRANSFORMATIONS HAVE BEEN WITNESSED IN OTHER CLUBS
MUSICKE TOBACCO SACKE AND SLEEPE THE TIDE OF SORROW BACKWARD KEEP AN INGENIOUS LOVER OF HIS PIPE DECLARED IRONICALLY IN THE SAME YEAR THAT HE HAD FOUND THREE BAD QUALITIES IN TOBACCO FOR IT MADE A MAN A THIEF WHICH MEANT DANGER A GOOD FELLOW WHICH MEANT COST AND A NIGGARD THE NAME OF WHICH IS HATEFUL IT MAKES HIM A THEEFE HE CONTINUED FOR HE WILL STEALE IT FROM HIS FATHER
PEPYS HAS VERY FEW ALLUSIONS TO TOBACCO
AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT PLAGUE ALL KINDS OF NOSTRUMS WERE SOLD AND RECOMMENDED AS PRESERVATIVES OR AS CURES
IT MAKES ME BOTH SAD AND GLAD
SOME OF THE PURITAN COLONISTS IN AMERICA TOOK A STRONG LINE ON THE SUBJECT
ADDICTED TO SMOKING SAD TO SAY THE ROYAL DUKE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH THE CIGAR THAT WAS BECOMING FASHIONABLE BUT ACTUALLY SMOKED A PIPE
GARRICK PRESSED FOR CERTAIN OMISSIONS BUT--"NO DAMN THEM SAID FIELDING IF THE SCENE IS NOT A GOOD ONE LET THEM FIND THAT OUT
IN THE CHIMNEY OF THE ROOM I BELIEVE THERE WAS TWO BUSHELS OF BROKEN TOBACCO PIPES ALMOST HALF ONE LOAD OF ASHES WHAT WOULD THE KING'S GRANDFATHER THE AUTHOR OF THE COUNTERBLASTE HAVE SAID COULD HE HAVE IMAGINED SUCH A SPECTACLE WITHIN THE PALACE WALLS
THIS BOX MADE OF COMMON HORN AND SMALL ENOUGH TO BE CARRIED IN THE POCKET WAS BOUGHT FOR FOURPENCE BY AN OVERSEER OF THE POOR IN THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE AND WAS PRESENTED BY HIM IN 1713 TO THE SOCIETY OF PAST OVERSEERS OF THE PARISH OF ST MARGARET WESTMINSTER
THE EARLIEST MENTION OF THEM IS DATED ABOUT 1670
THE TOBACCO ALSO WAS GONE AND EUROPEANS AND NATIVES SUFFERED GREATLY FROM THE WANT OF IT

A SUSSEX RECTOR THE REV
THE CURLED DARLINGS OF THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE PRETTY FELLOWS OF QUEEN ANNE'S TIME DID NOT FORSWEAR TOBACCO BUT THEY ABJURED SMOKING
NOT ONLY AT PLAYS BUT EVERYWHERE ELSE HE SAYS THE ENGLISH ARE CONSTANTLY SMOKING TOBACCO AND THEN HE PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DID IT
IF YOU ARE A SON OF TOIL GARBED IN YOUR HABIT AS YOU WORK THERE IS NOTHING INCONGRUOUS IN A WELL-SEASONED CLAY OR A NOSE-WARMER WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE YOU CARRY UPSIDE DOWN
YES SAID DICKENS I GENERALLY TAKE A CIGAR AFTER DINNER WHEN I'M ALONE THEREUPON SAID THE YOUNG LADY I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD UN WHEN WE GO UPSTAIRS BUT THE SEQUEL MUST BE TOLD IN THE NOVELIST'S OWN INIMITABLE STYLE
A CONFERENCE FOUNDED ON THE MUTUAL CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO WAS LIKELY NOT AS THE FRIVOLOUS WOULD SAY TO END IN SMOKE BUT TO LEAD TO SOLID AND LASTING RESULTS
THE ALFRED CLUB FOUNDED IN 1808 WHICH LORD BYRON DESCRIBED AS PLEASANT--"A LITTLE TOO SOBER AND LITERARY PERHAPS BUT ON THE WHOLE A DECENT RESOURCE ON A RAINY DAY AND WHICH SIR WILLIAM FRASER CALLED A SORT OF MINOR ATHENAEUM OWED ITS DEATH IN 1855 IF REPORT BE TRUE TO A DISPUTE ABOUT SMOKING
CANON ATKINSON IN HIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK FORTY YEARS IN A MOORLAND PARISH TELLS HOW WHEN HE FIRST WENT TO DANBY IN CLEVELAND--THEN VERY REMOTE FROM THE GREAT WORLD--AND HAD TO TAKE HIS FIRST FUNERAL HE FOUND INSIDE THE CHURCH THE PARISH CLERK WHO WAS ALSO PARISH SCHOOLMASTER BY THE WAY SITTING IN THE SUNNY EMBRASURE OF THE WEST WINDOW WITH HIS HAT ON AND COMFORTABLY SMOKING HIS PIPE
IN THE YEAR 1853 HE WROTE MEERSCHAUMS AND CLAYS WERE THE RULE AT BOTH THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND IN ALL SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE LAND AND THE ART OF MAKING PIPES OF WOOD WAS EITHER OBSOLETE IT HAD NEVER BEEN INTRODUCED OR WHOLLY IN FUTURO
SIGNS OF DECLINE ARE TO BE OBSERVED DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

THE INHALING OF THE SMOKE OF DRIED HERBS FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES WHETHER THROUGH A PIPE-SHAPED FUNNEL OR OTHERWISE HAD NOTHING IN IT AKIN TO THE SMOKING OF TOBACCO FOR BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL PLEASURE AND THEREFORE LIES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK
AND THE MAN WHO SMOKES THINKS LIKE A SAGE AND ACTS LIKE A SAMARITAN XI LATER VICTORIAN DAYS WHEN LIFE WAS ALL A SUMMER DAY AND I WAS UNDER TWENTY THREE LOVES WERE SCATTERED IN MY WAY AND THREE AT ONCE ARE PLENTY

BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU QUILP SMOKES CIGARS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HIS WRETCHED WIFE SITTING PATIENTLY BY FROM SUNSET TILL SOME TIME AFTER DAYBREAK
THIS ACCOUNT FIRST APPEARED IN ONE OF THE VOLUMES OF PENNANT'S TOUR IN WALES BUT THE LATE PROFESSOR ARBER LONG AGO POINTED OUT THAT THE REMARK AS TO THE MODE OF SMOKING BY CIGARS AND NOT BY PIPES WAS SIMPLY PENNANT'S SPECULATION
NOTHING IS PERFECTION NIHIL EST AB OMNI PARTE BEATUM BULL HOWEVER WAS NOT EXCESSIVE IN HIS SMOKING FOR HIS DAILY ALLOWANCE WAS BUT THREE PIPES
HOWEVER HE SENT GIFTS IN RETURN TO HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY AND AMONG THEM WERE A WEST AFRICAN STATE UMBRELLA A SELECTION OF HIGHLY COLOURED CLOTHING MATERIALS AND SOME NATIVE PIPES AND TOBACCO FOR THE QUEEN TO SMOKE
WHEN THE DISCOURSE WAS FINISHED HE KNOCKED THE ASHES OUT OF HIS PIPE REPLACED IT IN HIS SPORRAN RETURNED THE TOBACCO-POUCH OR SPLEUCHAN TO ITS OWNER AND JOINED IN THE PRAYERS WITH DECENCY AND ATTENTION DAVID DEANS HOWEVER DID NOT AT ALL APPROVE THIS IRREVERENCE

YET ALL THEIR CLAIM TO WISDOM IS--A PUFF
BUT IN ENGLAND SUCH DESECRATION HAS BEEN OCCASIONAL ONLY AND QUITE EXCEPTIONAL
WE HEAR THAT THE DAPPER WOODEN HIGHLANDERS WHO GUARD SO HEROICALLY THE DOORS OF SNUFF-SHOPS INTEND TO PETITION THE LEGISLATURE IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE EXCUSED FROM COMPLYING WITH THE ACT OF PARLIAMENT WITH REGARD TO THEIR CHANGE OF DRESS
THE CIRCULAR FLAT ON THE SIDE AWAY FROM THE PROJECTING STOPPER HAS TWO TINY ENGRAVED PICTURES
LET THE READER TURN TO THE CONFESSIONS OF GEORGE FITZ-BOODLE ESQ.--THE FITZ-BOODLE PAPERS FIRST APPEARED IN FRASER'S MAGAZINE FOR 1842--AND HE WILL FIND HOW SMOKING WAS REGARDED AT THAT DATE AND WHAT THACKERAY SPEAKING THROUGH THE PUPPET FITZ-BOODLE THOUGHT OF IT
JUST BEFORE REACHING HEMSTRIDGE FROM MILBORNE PORT AT THE CROSS-ROADS THERE IS A PUBLIC-HOUSE CALLED THE VIRGINIA INN
TO SMOKE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CIT OF THE COUNTRY SQUIRE OF THE CLERGY ESPECIALLY OF THE COUNTRY PARSONS AND OF THOSE OF LOWER SOCIAL STATUS
READERS OF DICKENS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DRAWING BY CRUIKSHANK WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE CHAPTER ON SCOTLAND YARD IN DICKENS'S SKETCHES BY BOZ WHICH WAS WRITTEN BEFORE 1836
NOWADAYS THE INCENSE FROM PIPES AND CIGARS AND CIGARETTES CURLS FREELY ROUND THESE OBSOLETE NOTICES AND HELPS TO MAKE THEM STILL DINGIER
THE MORE FASHIONABLE FOLK OF THE RESTORATION ERA AND LATER BEGAN TO LEAVE OFF IF NOT TO DISDAIN THE SMOKING-HABIT
ALL THE EVIDENCE AGREES THAT WHOEVER TAUGHT RALEIGH IT WAS RALEIGH'S EXAMPLE THAT BROUGHT SMOKING INTO NOTICE AND COMMON USE
AND J DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THACKERAY'S PICTURE AS QUITE TRUE OF THE WINES OF HIS UNDERGRADUATE DAY I.E ABOUT 1850
BUT THE TENDENCY--WITH EXCEPTIONS NO DOUBT--WAS TO RESTRICT THE USE OF TOBACCO TO THE CLERGY TO COUNTRY SQUIRES TO MERCHANTS AND TRADESMEN AND TO THE HUMBLER RANKS OF SOCIETY--TO LIMIT IT IN SHORT TO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES OF THE SOCIAL COMMONWEALTH AS THEN ORGANIZED
THE TASK IN THIS ESPECIAL CASE WAS ONLY THAT OF CHOOSING
SO OTHER MEMBERS LIGHTED UP AND THE PROCEEDINGS WENT ON PEACEFULLY TO THE APPOINTED HOUR OF CLOSING
IN 1702 RICHARD BRONAS TOBACCONIST WAS AT THE HORSE SHOE BREAD STREET
HEARNE THE ANTIQUARY WRITING EARLY IN 1721 SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IN THE GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON OF 1665 NONE OF THOSE WHO KEPT TOBACCONISTS SHOPS SUFFERED FROM IT AND THIS BELIEF NO DOUBT ENHANCED THE MEDICAL REPUTATION OF THE WEED
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIGAR-SMOKING AMONG THOSE CLASSES FROM WHICH TOBACCO HAD LONG BEEN PRACTICALLY BANISHED AND THE NATURAL CONSEQUENT SPREAD DOWNWARDS OF THE USE OF CIGARS--IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVARIABLE LAW OF FASHION--TOGETHER WITH THE CONTINUED DEVOTION TO THE PIPE AMONG THOSE WHOSE LOVE OF TOBACCO HAD NEVER SLACKENED MADE SMOKING A MUCH MORE GENERAL PRACTICE THAN IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME GENERATIONS
THAT THE SILVER PIPE DID NOT SMOKE SO WELL AS HIS OLD RED CLAY WITH A WOODEN STEM
BUT THE LAST DITCH OF THE OLD PREJUDICE HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE CONVENTION WHICH IN CERTAIN PLACES AND AT CERTAIN TIMES ADMITS THE CIGAR AND CIGARETTE OF FASHIONABLE ORIGIN BUT BARS THE ENTRY OF THE PLEBEIAN PIPE--THE PIPE WHICH FOR TWO CENTURIES WAS PRACTICALLY THE ONLY MODE OF SMOKING USED OR KNOWN
AMONG THE MUNICIPAL RECORDS OF EXETER IS THE FOLLOWING NOTE
IN THE SAME COLLECTION THERE ARE SEVERAL PAIRS OF EMBER-TONGS WITH HANDLES OR JAWS DECORATED
EVERY SMOKER KNOWS THE GLOWING TRIBUTE HE PAID TO IT IN HIS NIGHT AND MORNING WHICH APPEARED IN 1841
ALWAYS WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MEN HE'S RISEN AT EIGHT AND GONE TO BED AT TEN
BUT CONSIDERING THE FOPPERY OF THEIR ATTIRE AND MANNERS IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TOBACCO WAS NOT IN FAVOUR AMONG THEM
AMERICAN LADY HAD BEEN SMOKING ALL THE MORNING
IF YOU ARE WEARING A BOWLER HAT AND A LOUNGE SUIT YOU MAY WALK ALONG WITH A BRIAR PROTRUDING FROM YOUR LIPS AND NO ONE WILL THINK ILL OF YOU
I WAS SOON HOWEVER COMPELLED TO RESIGN IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF A GIDDINESS AND DISTRESSFUL FEELING IN MY EYES WHICH AS I HAD DRUNK BUT A SINGLE GLASS OF ALE MUST I KNEW HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT OF THE TOBACCO
A MAN WERE BETTER VISIT FIFTEEN JAILS--OR A DOZEN OR TWO HOSPITALS--THAN ONCE ADVENTURE TO COME NEAR THEM AND THE YOUNG RASCAL WHO AT EACH PAUSE MARKED BY A DASH HAD PUFFED HIS PIPE NO DOUBT BLOWING AN EXTRA LARGE CLOUD WHEN HE SWORE BY THIS VAPOUR TURNS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND SAYS
A LIST OF THE SEA-STORES PUT ON BOARD THE SHIP IN WHICH CERTAIN FRIENDS--SAMUEL FOTHERGILL MARY PEISLY KATHERINE PAYTON AND OTHERS--SAILED FROM PHILADELPHIA FOR ENGLAND IN JUNE 1756 IS STILL EXTANT
AND THEY SIT AND LOOK AT CHARTS OF IT THE PRESENT-DAY SMOKING-ROOM AT THE TRAVELLERS IS A NOBLE APARTMENT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY THE COFFEE-ROOM
SO YT I RECKON I HAVE AS GOOD AS 30S
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE CLOTH MR DOBSON HIS CHURCHWARDEN AND ONE OR TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL FARMERS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE TO WHOM HE INVARIABLY SAID I AM GOING TO READ PRAYERS BUT SHALL BE BACK BY THE TIME YOU HAVE MADE THE PUNCH OCCASIONALLY ANOTHER FARMER ACCOMPANIED HIM FROM CHURCH WHEN PIPES AND TOBACCO"--WITH THE PUNCH--"WERE IN REQUISITION UNTIL 6 O'CLOCK THE SABBATH AFTERNOON THUS SATISFACTORILY CONCLUDED FARMER RETURNED TO COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE AND TOOK A NAP TILL AT NINE HE WENT TO THE PARLOUR OF THE COLLEGE WHERE THE FELLOWS USUALLY ASSEMBLED AND PIPES AND TOBACCO CONCLUDED A WELL-SPENT DAY
A CASE OF OCTAGON SHAPE RECORDS THE TRIUMPH OF JUSTICE AND LORD CHANCELLOR LOUGHBOROUGH PRONOUNCING HIS DECREE FOR THE RESTITUTION OF THE BOX ON MARCH 5 1796
HE SAW SOME GOING SOME COMING SOME SCRIBBLING SOME TALKING SOME DRINKING SOME SMOKING OTHERS JINGLING
IT WAS EXTRAVAGANTLY ABUSED AND EXTRAVAGANTLY PRAISED
IT HAD BEEN HELD HE SAID BY TWO CHAIRMEN THAT SMOKING WAS NOT IN ORDER AT THE PUBLIC SESSIONS OF A STANDING COMMITTEE
WITS RECREATIONS 1640
THE HISTORY OF SMOKING BY WOMEN IS DEALT WITH SEPARATELY IN THE NEXT CHAPTER
THE HABIT WAS PROBABLY FAR FROM GENERAL AMONG WOMEN ALTHOUGH JOSHUA SYLVESTER A DOUGHTY OPPONENT OF THE WEED WAS PLEASED TO DECLARE THAT FOOLES OF ALL SEXES HAUNT IT I.E TOBACCO
IN 1631 EDMOND HOWES WHO EDITED STOW'S CHRONICLES AND CONTINUED THEM ONTO THE END OF THIS PRESENT YEARE 1631 WROTE THAT TOBACCO WAS AT THIS DAY COMMONLY USED BY MOST MEN AND MANY WOMEN ANYTHING LIKE GENERAL SMOKING BY WOMEN IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
THE ARRIVAL OF COFFEE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COFFEE-HOUSES OPENED A NEW FIELD FOR THE VICTORIES OF TOBACCO
AND SOMETIMES WITH COMPANY OF HER ACQUAINTANCE DID TAKE TOBACCO AND DRINCKE BEERE IN THE HALL OF GEORGE THRESHER'S HOUSE SOMETIMES WITH THE SAID GEORGE AND SOMETIMES WITH HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS
THERE IS NO GOOD REASON WHY ANYONE FOR SOCIAL OR ANY OTHER REASONS SHOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT THE REASONABLE USE OF TOBACCO
MILK PUNCH--SMOKING--GHASTLY HEADACHE--FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE OF DESSERT-TABLE NEXT MORNING AND SMELL OF TOBACCO BUT THE SATIRIST IS OFTEN TEMPTED TO BE EPIGRAMMATIC AT THE EXPENSE OF ACCURACY AND THIS PICTURE IS AT LEAST TOO HIGHLY COLOURED
SHE WILL NOT SMOKE YE GODS!)--BUT SHE WILL DRINK AND THE SAME WRITER DESCRIBES TOBACCO AS BY LADIES HATED HATED BY THE BEAUX ALTHOUGH THE FINE LADY MAY HAVE AFFECTED TO SWOON AT THE SIGHT OF PIPES AND BELLES GENERALLY LIKE THE BEAUX MAY HAVE DISDAINED TOBACCO AS VULGAR YET THERE WERE DOUBTLESS STILL TO BE FOUND HERE AND THERE RESPECTABLE WOMEN WHO OCCASIONALLY INDULGED IN A SMOKE
I THINK HE BE DRYLY REPLIED OLD JOSHUA THE SAME WRITER IN HIS COMPANION VOLUME ON THE OLD TIME PARSON MENTIONS THAT THE VICAR OF CODRINGTON IN 1692 FOUND THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY CUSTOMARY FOR PEOPLE TO PLAY CARDS ON THE COMMUNION TABLE AND THAT WHEN THEY CHOSE THE CHURCHWARDENS THEY USED TO SIT IN THE SANCTUARY SMOKING AND DRINKING THE CLERK GRAVELY SAYING WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH THAT SUCH HAD BEEN THEIR CUSTOM FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS ALTHOUGH PROBABLY THE CONDUCT OF THE CODRINGTON PARISHIONERS WAS UNUSUAL IT IS CERTAIN THAT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SMOKING AT MEETINGS HELD NOT IN THE CHURCH ITSELF BUT IN THE VESTRY WAS COMMON
A GENERAL MEETING WAS HELD TO DECIDE THE QUESTION SAYS MR RALPH NEVILL IN HIS LONDON CLUBS WHEN A NUMBER OF OLD GENTLEMEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN SEEN IN THE CLUB FOR YEARS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE STOUTLY DETERMINED TO RESIST THE PROPOSED DESECRATION
TO ME IT HAS BEEN A LABOUR OF LOVE
HE HOPED THAT THE NEXT GIFTS WOULD INCLUDE A CARRIAGE AND PAIR AND A WHITE WOMAN BOTH OF WHICH HE WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH
THIS CHAPTER AND THE NEXT DEAL WITH THE HISTORY OF SMOKING DURING THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS AFTER ITS INTRODUCTION AS A SOCIAL HABIT--ROUGHLY TO 1630
BUT I SAW MANY YEARS AGO A DISTINGUISHED MAN OF LETTERS THE LATE MR FRANCIS TURNER PALGRAVE OF GOLDEN TREASURY FAME WHO WAS AN INVETERATE SMOKER SITTING ON ONE OF THE CANE BENCHES BY THE DOOR OF THE ATHENAEUM CLUB SMOKING A SHORT CLAY PIPE
THACKERAY DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE REALIZED THAT TOBACCO WAS NOT INVADING ENGLAND FOR THE FIRST BUT FOR THE SECOND TIME NOR DID HE FORESEE THAT THE LADIES TO WHOM HE ADDRESSED HIS IMPASSIONED DEFENCE OF SMOKING WOULD NOT ONLY SUBMIT TO THE CONQUEROR BUT WOULD THEMSELVES BE FOUND AMONG HIS JOYOUS DEVOTEES
THE DOCTOR SAID H'M AND SCOWLED AT THE CIGAR
A CORRESPONDENT OF THE TIMES IN 1895 MENTIONED THAT HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM HOW SHE REMEMBERED SEEING SMOKING IN A WELSH CHURCH ABOUT 1850--"THE COMMUNION TABLE STOOD IN THE AISLE AND THE FARMERS WERE IN THE HABIT OF PUTTING THEIR HATS UPON IT AND WHEN THE SERMON BEGAN THEY LIT THEIR PIPES AND SMOKED BUT WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF IRREVERENCE IN AN ESSEX CHURCH ABOUT 1861 A VISITOR HAD POINTED OUT TO HIM VARIOUS NOOKS IN THE GALLERY WHERE SHORT PIPES WERE STOWED AWAY WHICH HE WAS INFORMED THE OLD MEN SMOKED DURING SERVICE
THIS IS CALLED A BUNKO AND BY YE PORTUGALS A CHEROOTA THE CONDEMNATION OF CHEROOT-OR CIGAR-SMOKING AS A MEAN METHOD OF TAKING TOBACCO HAS AN ODD LOOK IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN HABITS AND CUSTOMS
THE STORY IS FAMILIAR--IT MAY BE TRUE--THAT ONE EVENING HE AND TENNYSON SAT IN SOLEMN SILENCE SMOKING FOR HOURS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE AND THAT WHEN THE VISITOR ROSE TO GO CARLYLE AS HE BADE HIM GOOD-NIGHT SAID--"MAN ALFRED WE HAE HAD A GRAUND NICHT
MARSTON WROTE IN 1607
WHEREAS HIS MA^TIE TO PREVENT THE EXCESSE OF THE USE OF TOBACCO AND TO SET AN ORDER TO THOSE THAT REGRATE AND SELL OR UTTER IT BY RETAYLE WHO OBSERVE NOE REASONABLE RATES OR PRIZES PRICES NOR TAKE CARE THAT IT BE WHOLSOME FOR MEN'S BODYES THAT SHALL USE IT HAS CAUSED LETTERS TO BE SENT TO THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF CITTIES AND TOWNS REQUIRING THEM TO CERTIFY IN WHAT PLACES IT MIGHT BE FITT TO SUFFER YE RETAYLEING OF TOBACCO AND HOW MANY BE LICENCED IN EACH OF THOSE PLACES TO USE TRADE
FOR IT WAS HIS OVERBEARING WAY NOT TO ASK FOR LEAVE TO SMOKE BUT TO SMOKE WHEREVER HE WENT WHETHER INVITED TO DO SO OR NOT
HE WROTE OF TOBACCO COLE AND THE PROTESTANT RELIGION THE THREE GREAT BLESSINGS OF LIFE!"--AS STRANGE A JUMBLE AS ONE COULD WISH FOR
BUT ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS OFFERED A PIPE BY A JESTING YOUTH WHO THOUGHT THEREBY TO SHOCK SO SAINTLY A PERSON
TOBACCO IN THOSE EARLIEST DAYS HE SAYS WAS SOLD FOR ITS WEIGHT IN SILVER
FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
IT REPRESENTS AN ELDERLY PARTY AND A FAST ETONIAN SEATED SIDE BY SIDE IN A FIRST-CLASS COMPARTMENT
AND YET FOR WANT OF THIS REGULATION I HAVE SEEN A GOAT SET UP BEFORE THE DOOR OF A PERFUMER AND THE FRENCH KING'S HEAD AT A SWORD-CUTLER'S NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEW EXAMPLES GIVEN ABOVE TOBACCONISTS MORE THAN MOST TRADESMEN SEEM TO HAVE CONTINUED TO USE SIGNS THAT HAD AT LEAST SOME RELEVANCE TO THEIR TRADE
A PENNY WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A MORE USUAL CHARGE FOR A FREQUENT INSCRIPTION ON THE LID WAS
PROBABLY IT AFFORDED HIM SOME SOLACE IN THE DREADFUL MALADY FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED SO LONG EVEN THE STAID QUAKERS SMOKED
AND DAUGHTER AND THE FRENCHMEN HAD IT ALL TO THEMSELVES
FOR THE BARBER IS ILLUSTRATING HIS TALK BY POINTING WITH HIS TWISTED PIPE-STEM TO SIX FRAGMENTS WHICH HE HAS BROKEN FROM THE STEM AND ARRANGED ON THE TABLE IN THE SHAPE OF A CRESCENT
IT HAD FORMERLY BEEN A QUIET OLD-FASHIONED FAMILY HOTEL BUT APPARENTLY WAS NOT FURNISHED WITH A SMOKING-ROOM FOR ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS OF THE CLUB WHEN THEY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE WAS TO BUILD OUT OVER THE LEADS A LARGE AND COMFORTABLE SMOKING-ROOM
THE REVIVAL OF SMOKING AMONG THOSE WHO WERE MOST AMENABLE TO THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND AMONG WHOM CONSEQUENTLY TOBACCO HAD LONG BEEN IN BAD ODOUR CAME BY WAY OF THE CIGAR
SEVENTEENTH--CENTURY LONDON SIGNS WERE THE THREE TOBACCO PIPES TWO TOBACCO PIPES CROSSED AND FIVE TOBACCO PIPES AT EDINBURGH IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE TOBACCONISTS WHO USED TWO PIPES CROSSED A ROLL OF TOBACCO AND TWO LEAVES OVER TWO CROSSED PIPES AND A ROLL OF TOBACCO AND THREE LEAVES
IT RIPENS THE BRAIN IT OPENS THE HEART
BUT THIS WAS SATIRE AND HARDLY HAD MUCH RELATION TO FACT
BUT WHAT QUITE DISGUSTED OUR VISITOR WAS THAT WHEN ONE DRINKS THE HEALTH OF ANY PERSON IN COMPANY THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY DOES NOT PERMIT YOU TO DRINK MORE THAN HALF THE CUP WHICH IS FILLED UP AND PRESENTED TO HIM OR HER WHOSE HEALTH YOU HAVE DRUNK
ASK THE CLUB-HOUSES HAVE THEY SMOKING-ROOMS OR NOT
THE BOOKS MAY BE CONSULTED AND PORSON SHALL DO IT AND HE WILL DO IT
THERE IS DIRECT EVIDENCE TOO BESIDES THE STORY IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS CHAPTER THAT WOMEN DISLIKED THE PREVALENCE OF SMOKING
WELL SO DOES MY GRAND OLD PIPE FOR THE SAKE OF ITS EXCELLENT SAVOUR FOR THE MANY SWEET SMOKES OF THE PAST MY PIPE KEEPS ITS HOLD ON MY FAVOUR THO NOW IT IS BLACKENING FAST BUT ALTHOUGH MANY PIPES WERE SMOKED AT THE UNIVERSITIES THERE WERE OCCASIONALLY TO BE FOUND ODD SURVIVALS OF OLD PREJUDICES
WOMEN GO LARGELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE CEASED TO CONSIDER TOBACCO-SMOKE AS A THING TO BE RIGIDLY AVOIDED AND THEREFORE HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCOMPANYING THEIR MENFOLK
HAYWARDS HEATH
MANY WOMEN IN ENGLAND WHO ARE WELL THOUGHT OF SMOKE
THEY MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE MUCH LONGER CHURCHWARDEN OR YARD OF CLAY WHICH WAS NOT IN VOGUE TILL THE EARLY YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
FOR ONE THING IT LEAVES TOO STRONG AND TOO CLINGING AN ODOUR ON THE CLOTHES
A VISITOR FROM ABROAD MR MURALT A SWISS GENTLEMAN WRITING ABOUT 1696 SAID THAT CHARACTER COULD BE WELL STUDIED AT THE COFFEE-HOUSES
AND SO ON HORSEBACK WITH THOSE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN ON FOOT BESIDE HIM TOOK TOBACCO WHILST I WAS TELLING HIS LORDSHIP OF THE MEN I HAD SENT FORTH AND ORDERS I HAD GIVEN PRESENTLY CAME THE SOUND OF GUNS WHICH MADE HIS LORDSHIP CAST HIS PIPE FROM HIM AND LISTEN TO THE SHOOTING ANOTHER FAMOUS NOBLEMAN LORD HERBERT OF CHERBURY ALL-VIRTUOUS HERBERT

AN AMUSING INCIDENT IS RELATED IN FORSTER'S LIFE OF DICKENS WHICH SHOWS HOW ENTIRELY UNKNOWN WAS SMOKING AMONG WOMEN OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES IN ENGLAND SOME TEN YEARS AFTER QUEEN VICTORIA CAME TO THE THRONE
WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF WEST END CLUBLAND SMOKING EXCEPT IN THE DINING-ROOM WAS EVERYWHERE ALLOWED BY SMOKING IS NO DOUBT HERE MEANT EVERYTHING BUT PIPES WHICH WERE NOT CONSIDERED GENTLEMANLY EVEN AT THE GARRICK CLUB AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SIXTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY THAT CIGARETTE-SMOKING BY WOMEN BEGAN TO CREEP IN

A FLEET STREET TOBACCONIST OF THIS TIME WAS ALSO A DEALER IN WORSTED STOCKINGS

HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT APOTHECARIES SHOPS GROCERS SHOPS AND CHANDLERS SHOPS WERE ALMOST NEVER WITHOUT COMPANY WHO FROM MORNING TO NIGHT WERE STILL TAKING TOBACCO

AT THE ANNIVERSARY FEAST IN 1743 THERE WERE TWO TABLES TO PROVIDE FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GUESTS BEING ABOUT THIRTY AND TWO CORSES TO EACH
BUT HIS DENUNCIATIONS WERE INEFFECTUAL IN BOTH MATTERS--HEADS CONTINUED TO BE ADORNED WITH CURLS OF FOREIGN GROWTH AND PIPE-SMOKE CONTINUED TO ASCEND
IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS EVER A TIME WHEN THE SLANG OF THE DAY WAS NOT CURRENT ON THE LIPS OF YOUNG OXFORD OR THAT SO LONG AS TOBACCO WAS PROCURABLE IT DID NOT FIND ITS WAY INTO COLLEGE ROOMS
THERE WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SOME SMOKERS WHO DISLIKED THE NEW-FANGLED CIGARS
I NEED NOT TELL MY READER THAT LIGHTING A MAN'S PIPE AT THE SAME CANDLE IS LOOKED UPON AMONG BROTHER-SMOAKERS AS AN OVERTURE TO CONVERSATION AND FRIENDSHIP FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SMOKING HAS INDUCED AND FOSTERED A SPIRIT OF COMRADESHIP
IN THE FIFTIES THE PIPES SMOKED WERE MOSTLY CLAYS
THE DEAD PROTECTOR WAS NOT TREATED TOO RESPECTFULLY BY HIS SOLDIERY

TOBACCO WAS CERTAINLY CHEAP IN SCOTLAND
THIS WAS PROBABLY QUITE UNTRUE AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE
THE LONDON SOCIETY OF APOTHECARIES ON AUGUST 15 1655 HELD A MEETING FOR THE ELECTION OF A MASTER AND AN UPPER WARDEN
IT HAS SOMETIMES BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THE COMPANION OF SWIFT'S STELLA MRS REBECCA DINGLEY WAS ADDICTED TO SMOKING
THERE IS A DOUBTFUL OLD LEGEND ABOUT RALEIGH'S FIRST PIPE THE SCENE OF WHICH MAY BE NOT UNFAIRLY LAID AT DURHAM HOUSE WHERE RALEIGH LIVED THE ALE STORY IS MYTHICAL BUT IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT SIR WALTER'S FIRST PIPES WERE SMOKED IN DURHAM HOUSE
NOR MUST THE DELIGHTFUL VERSES BY J.K.S BE FORGOTTEN IN WHICH THE AUTHOR OF LAPSUS CALAMI SINGS OF THE GRAND OLD PIPE AND I'M SMOKING A PIPE WHICH IS FASHIONED LIKE THE FACE OF THE GRAND OLD MAN AND THE QUAINT SIMILARITY OR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PIPE AND GLADSTONE THE GRAND OLD MAN WHEN LAPSUS CALAMI APPEARED IN 1888 IS MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT GROWS HE BLACK IN HIS FACE WITH HIS LABOURS

IF HE ARGUED THERE WERE MEN WHOSE BODIES WERE BENEFITED BY TOBACCO-SMOKE THIS DID NOT SO MUCH REDOUND TO THE CREDIT OF TOBACCO AS IT DID REFLECT UPON THE DEPRAVED CONDITION OF SUCH MEN THAT THEIR BODIES SHOULD HAVE SUNK TO THE LEVEL OF THOSE OF BARBARIANS SO AS TO BE AFFECTED BY REMEDIES SUCH AS WERE EFFECTIVE ON THE BODIES OF BARBARIANS AND INDIANS

SO WAS JOSEPH TUGGS POOR CYMON ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO COULD NEVER SMOKE WITHOUT FEELING IT INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY TO RETIRE IMMEDIATELY AND NEVER COULD SMELL SMOKE WITHOUT A STRONG DISPOSITION TO COUGH CONSEQUENTLY AS THE APARTMENT WAS SMALL THE DOOR CLOSED AND THE SMOKE POWERFUL POOR CYMON WAS SOON COMPELLED TO COUGH WHICH PRECIPITATED THE CATASTROPHE
THE MOST CURIOUS STORY ILLUSTRATING KINGSLEY'S LOVE OF TOBACCO IS THAT TOLD IN THE LIFE OF ARCHBISHOP BENSON BY HIS SON MR A.C
OR HE COULD GO AND SMOKE A CIGAR IN THE POOL-ROOM OR AT ANY ONE OF A DOZEN OTHER PLACES CIGARS WERE THE FASHIONABLE FORM OF SMOKE
SIMILAR MIXTURES OR THE LEAVES OF COLTSFOOT ALONE HAVE OFTEN BEEN SMOKED IN BYGONE DAYS BY FOLK WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TO SMOKE TOBACCO ONLY

AMERICAN LADY IMMEDIATELY LIGHTED HERS
THE HISTORY OF SMOKING BY WOMEN THROUGH VICTORIAN DAYS NEED NOT DETAIN US LONG
THIS TOO WAS DOUBTLESS VIRGINIAN OR COLONIAL TOBACCO
PERHAPS THE MOST CURIOUS THING IN CONNEXION WITH THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF ALLUSIONS TO SMOKING IN THE LITERATURE OF THE PERIOD IS THAT THERE IS NO MENTION WHATEVER OF TOBACCO OR SMOKING IN THE PLAYS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO TAKE A WHIFF THE BATTLE HAD BEGUN THE INCIDENT WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF A PICTURE BY ERNEST CROFTS A.R.A WHICH WAS EXHIBITED AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY IN 1888
LINENDRAPERS HATTERS PAWNBROKERS AND OTHER TRADESMEN ALL USED THE SAME SIGN AT VARIOUS DATES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
SOMETIMES COLTSFOOT WAS MIXED WITH TOBACCO
THE FRENCHMEN SMOKED OF COURSE THEY WERE REALLY MODEST GENTLEMEN AND SEEMED DISMAYED AND DAUGHTER PLAYED FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO WITH A CIGAR CONTINUALLY IN HER MOUTH--NEVER OUT OF IT

ABOUT THE END OF 1906 IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE SHOP WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND THAT THE TIME-WORN FIGURE WAS FOR SALE
IT SEEMS CERTAIN MOREOVER THAT SOME WOMEN AT LEAST SMOKED VERY SOON AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF TOBACCO
BUT WHATEVER SMOKING OF THIS KIND TOOK PLACE WAS MEDICINAL AND NOT SOCIAL

EURIPUS WAS THE NAME IN ANCIENT GEOGRAPHY OF THE CHANNEL BETWEEN EUBOEA NEGROPONT AND THE MAINLAND--A PASSAGE WHICH WAS CELEBRATED FOR THE VIOLENCE AND UNCERTAINTY OF ITS CURRENTS--AND HENCE THE NAME WAS OCCASIONALLY APPLIED BY OUR OLDER WRITERS TO ANY STRAIT OR SEA-CHANNEL HAVING LIKE CHARACTERISTICS

WHEN ONE GEORGE GLAPTHORNE OF WHITTLESEY J.P WAS RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE ISLE OF ELY IN 1654 HIS RETURN WAS PETITIONED AGAINST AND AMONG OTHER CHARGES IT WAS SAID THAT JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION IN A CERTAIN MARTIN'S ALE-HOUSE HE HAD PROMISED TO GIVE MRS MARTIN A ROLL OF TOBACCO AND HAD ALSO UNDERTAKEN TO GRANT HER HUSBAND A LICENCE TO BREW THUS UNDULY INFLUENCING AND CORRUPTING THE ELECTORS
BY WHICH MEANES THE USE THEREOF NOT ONLY PRESERVETH THE BODY FROM OBSTRUCTIONS
THIS IS THE FAMOUS OLD WOODEN HIGHLANDER WHICH STOOD FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS ON GUARD AT A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD
ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT ST MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION
AND HE INTREATS THE OFFICERS COMMANDING REGIMENTS TO PREVENT SMOKING IN THE MESS ROOMS OF THEIR SEVERAL REGIMENTS AND IN THE ADJOINING APARTMENTS AND TO DISCOURAGE THE PRACTICE AMONG THE OFFICERS OF JUNIOR RANK IN THEIR REGIMENTS THE DUKE'S PREJUDICES WERE STRONGER THAN HIS FACTS

AND OF COURSE IF HIS RULING WERE FORMALLY ASKED HE WOULD BE BOUND TO FOLLOW PRECEDENT
LADY DOROTHY NEVILL WHOSE MEMORY COVERED SO LARGE A PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SAID IN THE LEAVES FROM HER NOTE-BOOK WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1907 THAT TO SMOKE IN HYDE PARK EVEN UP TO COMPARATIVELY RECENT YEARS WAS LOOKED UPON AS ABSOLUTELY UNPARDONABLE

SO WAS THE LIEUTENANT
WITH AN EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE FAIR VENNER NOTWITHSTANDING HIS DISLIKE OF THE SAVOUR REFUSES TO CONDEMN TOBACCO UTTERLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CONSIDERS ITS VALUABLE MEDICINAL QUALITIES AND HE GOES SO FAR AS TO GIVE 10 PRECEPTS IN THE USE OF TOBACCO
KING JAMES IN HIS REFERENCE TO THE FIRST AUTHOR OF WHAT HE CALLS THIS ABUSE CLEARLY HAD SIR WALTER RALEIGH IN VIEW AND IT IS RALEIGH WITH WHOM IN THE POPULAR MIND THE FIRST PIPE OF TOBACCO SMOKED IN ENGLAND IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED
HE IS SAID TO HAVE SMOKED A PIPE ON THE MORNING OF HIS EXECUTION BEFORE HE WENT TO THE SCAFFOLD A TRADITION WHICH IS QUITE CREDIBLE

ON THE ASSURANCE HOWEVER THAT THE TOBACCO WAS EQUALLY MILD AND SEEING TOO THAT IT WAS OF A YELLOW COLOUR,--NOT FORGETTING THE LAMENTABLE DIFFICULTY I HAVE ALWAYS EXPERIENCED IN SAYING NO AND IN ABSTAINING FROM WHAT THE PEOPLE ABOUT ME WERE DOING,--I TOOK HALF A PIPE FILLING THE LOWER HALF OF THE BOLE WITH SALT
THINKING IT WAS BUT A DREAM
IT CANNOT THEREFORE BE THAT PIPES ARE BARRED BECAUSE OF A SUPPOSED GREATER EFFECT UPON THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ROOM
IN THIS REPORT HARIOT SAYS OF THE TOBACCO PLANT
TOWARDS THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ONE PETER COCKBURN TRADED AS A TOBACCONIST AT THE SIGN OF THE ABEL DRUGGER IN FENCHURCH STREET AND INFORMED THE PUBLIC ON THE ADVERTISING PAPERS IN WHICH HE WRAPPED UP HIS TOBACCO FOR CUSTOMERS THAT HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN SHOPMAN AT THE SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY--A NOTICE WHICH HAS PRESERVED THE NAME OF ANOTHER TOBACCONIST'S SIGN BORROWED FROM LITERATURE
BUT SO EARLY AS 1655 THERE IS A SIGN OF CHANGE OF CUSTOM--A CHANGE THAT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF RESTRICTING AND LIMITING THE HITHERTO UNBOUNDED FREEDOM GRANTED TO THE USE OF TOBACCO
SMOKING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 193 XIII
SOMETIMES THE TOBACCO-BOX WAS OF IVORY
CLOUDS WERE BLOWN UNDER ARCHIEPISCOPAL ROOFS
BLUE DEVILS FLY BEFORE ITS HONEST BREATH
THEY ARE TOLERANT OF SMOKING IN THEIR PRESENCE IN PUBLIC PLACES IN RESTAURANTS--IN FACT WHEREVER MEN AND WOMEN CONGREGATE--TO A DEGREE THAT WOULD HAVE HORRIFIED EXTREMELY THEIR MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF OTHER COLLECTIONS OF LETTERS OF THE SAME PERIOD--THE SELWYN LETTERS THE DELANY CORRESPONDENCE AND SO ON
IN DESCRIBING IN CONVERSATION THE MANNER IN WHICH A STORY IS SOMETIMES TOLD THE POET SAYS
THE FORM AND MAKE OF THE FIRST PIPE IS A MATTER I DO NOT PROPOSE TO GO INTO HERE
BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS MAJESTY MADE A LENGTHY REJOINDER IN WHICH HE SAID SOME CURIOUS THINGS
IT IS HE SAYS LIKE A FANCY BALL
BYRON IS REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN ANOTHER CIGAR-SMOKER
YET GENTUES MALLABARS C SMOKE THEIRE TOBACCO AFTER A VERY MEANE BUT I JUDGE ORIGINAL MANNER ONELY YE LEAFE ROWLED UP AND LIGHT ONE END HOLDINGE YE OTHER BETWEEN THEIR LIPS
THE YOUNGER LADY'S CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE SHOCKED THE PRIM MAIDS AND MATRONS OF THAT DAY
IT WAS HIS INVARIABLE PRACTICE WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE VISITING TO SMOKE A PIPE AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OUT OF BED
THIS HERO DRAWING TOBACCO FROM HIS POCKET DECLARES THAT IT IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF SEVEN POUNDS WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT ONLY YESTERDAY WAS SEVEN-NIGHT A CONSUMPTION OF SEVEN POUNDS OF TOBACCO IN EIGHT DAYS IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER

HE WAS BRUTALLY OVERBEARING TOWARDS OTHER FOLK AND WOULD ACCEPT NO INVITATION EXCEPT ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE MIGHT SMOKE WHEN AND WHERE HE LIKED
AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY WRITER OLDYS IN HIS LIFE OF SIR WALTER RALEIGH DECLARES THAT TOBACCO SOON BECAME OF SUCH VOGUE IN QUEEN ELIZABETH'S COURT THAT SOME OF THE GREAT LADIES AS WELL AS NOBLEMEN THEREIN WOULD NOT SCRUPLE TO TAKE A PIPE SOMETIMES VERY SOCIABLY BUT THESE STORIES REST ON VAGUE TRADITION AND PROBABLY HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT

ON ONE OCCASION WHEN I HAD TO CALL UPON HIM I FOUND HIM DRINKING RUM AND WATER AND ENJOYING WHAT HE CALLED HIS LUXURY THE FUMES OF TOBACCO NOT THROUGH A PIPE OR IN THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR BUT BURNT IN A DISH SMOKING HAD CERTAINLY NOT DIED OUT AT CAMBRIDGE EVEN AT THE TIME WHEN DENISON WAS AT OXFORD

THE SOCIAL TABOO WAS BY NO MEANS UNIVERSAL--SOME OF THE EXCEPTIONS WILL BE NOTED IN THESE PAGES--BUT SPEAKING BROADLY THE GENERAL ALMOST UNIVERSAL SMOKING OF TOBACCO WHICH HAD BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE EARLIER DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DID NOT AGAIN PREVAIL UNTIL WITHIN LIVING MEMORY

MY DEAR SIR SAID THE GREAT NOVELIST ALL YOUR OBJECTIONS TO TOBACCO ONLY INCREASE THE RELISH WITH WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT CIGAR XIII SMOKING BY WOMEN LADIES WHEN PIPES ARE BROUGHT AFFECT TO SWOON

GOSTANZO IN CHAPMAN'S ALL FOOLS 1605 SAYS
IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH LED TO THE GREAT INCREASE IN PIPE-SMOKING WHICH TOOK PLACE FROM THIS TIME ONWARDS WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BRIAR PIPE
WITH THE REIGN OF QUEEN ANNE TOBACCO HAD ENTERED ON A PERIOD DESTINED TO BE OF LONG DURATION WHEN SMOKING WAS TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT UNDER A SOCIAL BAN

ON WHOSE EVERY PART TRUTH MIGHT SPEND ALL HER VOICE FAME ALL HER ART WAS A SMOKER AS WE KNOW FROM A VERY CURIOUS PASSAGE IN HIS WELL-KNOWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY
A TOBACCONIST NAMED MILWARD LIVED AT THE BLACK BOY IN REDCROSS STREET BARBICAN IN 1742
THE NUMBER OF SHOPS WHERE TOBACCO WAS SOLD IN THE EARLY DAYS OF ITS TRIUMPH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY
WE ARE INFORMED IN THE USUAL STYLE OF SUCH PAGES THAT THE WELL-DRESSED WOMAN HAS BEGUN TO CONSIDER THE LITTLE SMOKING-JACKET INDISPENSABLE THIS JACKET WE ARE TOLD IS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER TO THE BRAIDED VELVET COATS WHICH WERE DONNED BY OUR MASCULINE FORBEARS IN THE DAYS OF LONG DROOPING CAVALRY MOUSTACHES TIGHTLY BUTTONED FROCK-COATS AND FLEXIBLE CANES
HUTTON IN HIS HISTORY OF DERBY SAYS THAT WHEN THAT TOWN WAS VISITED BY THE PLAGUE IN 1665 THAT AT THE HEADLESS-CROSS
AND TO THINK THAT THE TITHING-MAN HAD NO NOSE WHEN HE WAS SO ARGUS-EYED ON WEEKDAYS MANY NEW ENGLAND PURITANS PROBABLY SMOKED AS THEIR FRIENDS IN OLD ENGLAND DID

WITH THIS MAY BE COMPARED THE MACARONIC LINES
IN THE ALE-HOUSE MEN OF THE VARIOUS CLASSES AND OCCUPATIONS ENUMERATED SAYS THE TRAVELLER WOULD SIT PROMISCUOUSLY IN COMMON DIRTY ROOMS WITH LARGE FIRES AND CLOUDS OF TOBACCO WHERE ONE THAT IS NOT USED TO THEM CAN SCARCE BREATHE OR SEE THE ANTIQUARY HEARNE HAS LEFT ON RECORD AN ACCOUNT OF A CURIOUS SMOKING MATCH HELD AT OXFORD IN 1723
THE VICAR FORTHWITH FILLED HIS PIPE AND DRANK VERY CORDIALLY TO MY FRIEND HIS HOST
THE LETTER FURTHER DIRECTS THAT THE LICENSEES SO APPOINTED SHALL BECOME BOUND TO SELL ONLY SOUND TOBACCO--AN ADMIRABLE PROVISION IF A TRIFLE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE--AND TO KEEP GOOD ORDER IN THEIR HOUSES AND SHOPS
WHEN THE LITTLE MONSTER COMES HOME UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER OF THE BOOK AND BREAKS UP HIS WIFE'S TEA-PARTY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN AN ARM-CHAIR--"WITH HIS LARGE HEAD AND FACE SQUEEZED UP AGAINST THE BACK AND HIS LITTLE LEGS PLANTED ON THE TABLE"--WITH A CASE-BOTTLE OF RUM COLD WATER AND A BOX OF CIGARS BEFORE HIM
AT SIMPSON'S FISH ORDINARY AT BILLINGSGATE THESE PIPES WERE ALWAYS PLACED ON THE TABLE AFTER DINNER TOGETHER WITH SCREWS OF SHAG TOBACCO AND A SMOKING PARLIAMENT MOISTENED WITH HOT OR COLD PUNCH ACCORDING TO THE SEASON WAS GENERALLY HELD DURING THE FOLLOWING HOUR
THE SMUG PROPRIETY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENJOY A SMOKE IN PRIVATE IS DELIGHTFUL

WHAT QUEEN VICTORIA WHO HATED TOBACCO AND BANISHED IT FROM HER PRESENCE AND FROM HER ABODES AS FAR AS SHE COULD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AND SAID OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CIGARETTE-SMOKING IS INDULGED IN NOW BY WOMEN IS A QUESTION QUITE UNANSWERABLE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALL SIGNIFICANT AND FOR THE SOCIAL HISTORIAN ARE INVALUABLE
CONCEIVE THIS IN A GREAT HOTEL WITH NOT ONLY THEIR OWN SERVANTS BUT HALF A DOZEN WAITERS COMING CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT

PERNICIOUS WEED
HE WARNED HIS READERS THAT TOBACCO-SMOKE WAS VERY PERNICIOUS UNTO THEIR BODIES TOO PROFLUVIOUS FOR MANY OF THEIR PURSES AND MOST PESTIFEROUS TO THE PUBLIKE STATE MUCH MAY BE FORGIVEN HOWEVER TO THE INTRODUCER OF SO CHARMING A TERM OF ABUSE AS PROFLUVIOUS DEACON'S BOOK TAKES THE FORM OF A DIALOGUE AND AFTER NEARLY 200 PAGES OF ARGUMENT IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE HERB GETS NO MERCY ONE OF THE INTERLOCUTORS A TRADER IN TOBACCO IS SO CONVINCED OF THE INIQUITY OF HIS TRADE AND OF HIS OWN PARLOUS STATE IF HE CONTINUE THEREIN THAT HE DECLARES THAT THE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS WORTH OF THIS BEASTLY TOBACCO WHICH HE OWNS SHALL PRESENTLY PACKE TO THE FIRE OR ELSE BE SENT SWIMMING DOWN THE THAMES MANY GOOD FOLK WOULD SEEM TO HAVE ASSOCIATED SMOKING WITH IDLING
LAMB A FAREWELL TO TOBACCO THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
CONSEQUENTLY MEN HAD EITHER TO INDULGE IN THE PRACTICE OUT OF DOORS OR ELSE AS YOU SAY SNEAK AWAY TO THE KITCHEN WHEN THE SERVANTS HAD GONE TO BED AND PUFF UP THE CHIMNEY
BOTH CUTTIES AND CHURCHWARDENS WERE SMOKED BUT THE LATTER OF COURSE WERE NOT ADAPTED FOR PERSONS ENGAGED IN ACTIVE PURSUITS AND WERE ESSENTIALLY OF WHAT I MAY CALL A SEDENTARY NATURE
IT IS SOMEWHAT SINGULAR THAT THE PURITANS WHO DENOUNCED MOST AMUSEMENTS AND PLEASURES AND WHO FROWNED UPON MOST OF THE OCCUPATIONS OR DIVERSIONS THAT MAKE FOR GAIETY AND THE ENJOYMENT OF LIFE DID NOT AS PURITANS DENOUNCE THE USE OF TOBACCO
HERE HE SITS WROTE COWPER WITH HIS BACK AGAINST ONE BRICK WALL AND HIS NOSE AGAINST ANOTHER WHICH MUST YOU KNOW BE VERY REFRESHING AND GREATLY ASSIST MEDITATION COWPER'S AVERSION FROM TOBACCO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG FOR HE ENCOURAGED HIS FRIEND TO SMOKE IN THE FAMOUS SUMMER HOUSE AT OLNEY WHICH WAS THE POET'S OUTDOOR STUDY
LYTE IN HIS TRANSLATION 1578 OF DODOENS HISTORIE OF PLANTS SAYS OF COLTSFOOT
OTHER WRITERS SPEAK OF BLACK SPICE GALANGA AQUA VITAE SPANISH WINE ANISEEDS AND OTHER THINGS AS BEING USED FOR PURPOSES OF ADULTERATION
IT IS THEN A PERFECT CLOUD OF FUME
FAIRHOLT'S HISTORY OF TOBACCO 1859 AND THE TOBACCO 1857 OF ANDREW STEINMETZ ARE STILL VALUABLE AUTHORITIES--BUT HITHERTO NO ONE HAS TOLD THE STORY OF THE FLUCTUATIONS OF FASHION IN RESPECT OF THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING
AND JONSON IN EVERY MAN OUT OF HIS HUMOUR 1600 SPEAKS OF ONE WHO PRETENDED FAMILIARITY WITH COURTIERS THAT HE TALKED OF THEM AS IF HE HAD TAKEN TOBACCO WITH THEM OVER THE STAGE IN THE LORDS ROOM AMONG THE GENERAL AUDIENCE OF THE THEATRE SMOKING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN USUAL ALSO
LIKE OTHER CHARMERS WOOING THE CARESS MORE DAZZLINGLY WHEN DARING IN FULL DRESS
THERE ARE OCCASIONS SUCH AS IN THE TRENCHES DURING MILITARY OPERATIONS WHEN WORN OUT WITH EXPOSURE AND FATIGUE OR WHEN EXHAUSTED BY SLOW STARVATION WITH NO FOOD IN PROSPECT WHEN A PIPE OR CIGAR WILL BE A WELCOME AND VALUABLE FRIEND IN NEED RESTING THE WEARY LIMBS CHEERING THE FAINTING HEART ALLAYING THE GNAWING HUNGER OF THE EMPTY STOMACH SIR G.W

HE APPEARS TO HAVE SMOKED NOT SO MUCH FOR PLEASURE AS FOR SUPPOSED REASONS OF HEALTH
IN A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MONOGRAMS WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAKERS OF CERTAIN PIPES FOUND IN QUANTITIES AT VARIOUS PLACES BY REFERENCE TO THE FREEMAN AND BURGESS ROLLS AND PARISH REGISTERS
CANDIDATES FOR DEGREES OR GRADUATES TO DISPLAY THEIR PROFICIENCY PUBLICLY MAINTAINED THESES

BUT AMONG HUMBLER FOLK PIPE-SMOKING HAD NEVER GONE OUT EVERY PUBLIC-HOUSE DID ITS REGULAR TRADE IN CLAYS KNOWN AS CHURCHWARDENS AND BROSELEYS AND BY OTHER NAMES EITHER OF FAMILIARITY OR DESCRIPTIVE OF THE PLACE OF MANUFACTURE
TO PROVIDENT WOMEN THIS WILL SEEM NO EVIL INFLUENCE IN MARRIED LIFE
MORTIMER COLLINS WRITING IN 1869 IN A CURIOUS OUTBURST AGAINST THE USE OF TOBACCO BY YOUNG MEN SAID WHEN ONE HEARS OF SLY CIGARETTES BETWEEN FEMININE LIPS AT CROQUET PARTIES THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID SINCE THAT DATE CIGARETTE-SMOKING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AMONG WOMEN AND THE TERM SLY HAS LONG CEASED TO BE APPLICABLE
THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE USE OF TOBACCO FOR SMOKING WAS LARGELY CONFINED TO THE MIDDLE AND HUMBLER CLASSES OF SOCIETY
OH DAMN THEM THEY HAVE FOUND IT OUT HAVE THEY SIMON FRASER LORD LOVAT THE CRAFTY OLD JACOBITE WHO TOOK PART IN THE RISING OF 1745 AND WHO WAS EXECUTED ON TOWER HILL IN 1747 WAS A SMOKER
I KNOW OF NO CERTAIN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY REFERENCE TO THE HIGHLANDER AS A TOBACCONIST'S SIGN
THE DERIVATION OF CIGAR IS NOT ALTOGETHER CLEAR
OLD CUSTOMS DIE HARD WITH COGERS AND THEY STUCK TO THEIR PIPE
SMOKING WAS STILL POPULAR ALSO AT OXFORD
THE OLDER TOBACCONISTS WERE WONT TO ASSERT SAYS LARWOOD THAT THE MAN IN THE MOON COULD ENJOY HIS PIPE HENCE THE MAN IN THE MOON IS REPRESENTED ON SOME OF THE TOBACCONISTS PAPERS IN THE BANKS COLLECTION PUFFING LIKE A STEAM ENGINE AND UNDERNEATH THE WORDS WHO'LL SMOAKE WITH YE MAN IN YE MOONE THE DUTCH AS EVERY ONE KNOWS ARE GREAT SMOKERS SO A DUTCHMAN HAS BEEN A COMMON FIGURE ON TOBACCONISTS SIGNS
HARK YOU MY HOST HAVE YOU A PIPE OF GOOD TOBACCO THE BEST IN THE TOWN SAYS MINE HOST AFTER THE MANNER OF HIS CLASS

IN HIS GARDEN AT NEWPORT PAGNELL BULL SHOWED COWPER A NOOK IN WHICH HE HAD PLACED A BENCH WHERE HE SAID HE FOUND IT VERY REFRESHING TO SMOKE HIS PIPE AND MEDITATE

THE LADIES WHO SO SURPRISED DICKENS WERE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN BUT AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION--THE EARLY FORTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY--ONE OF THE FREAKS OF FASHION AT PARIS WAS THE GIVING OF LUNCHEON PARTIES FOR LADIES ONLY AT WHICH CIGARS WERE HANDED ROUND

SOME OF THEM IN IVORY AND INLAID WOOD MAY BE SEEN AT THE HOTEL CLUNY IN PARIS AND AN ENGRAVING OF SUCH AN OBJECT OCCURS IN ARCHAEOLOGIA VOL
NEITHER HOST NOR GUEST IMAGINED WHAT A REVOLUTION ANOTHER GENERATION OR SO WOULD MAKE IN THESE SOCIAL HABITS

HEE IS THE PIECING COMMONLY OF SOME OTHER TRADE WHICH IS BAWDE TO HIS TOBACCO AND THAT TO HIS WIFE WHICH IS THE FLAME THAT FOLLOWS THIS SMOKE THIS BRIEF CHARACTER IS HARDLY SO POINTED OR SO EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF THE OTHERS IN THE MICRO-COSMOGRAPHIE BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE BISHOP WAS NOT VERY FRIENDLY TO TOBACCO
BISHOP HALL SATIRIZING THE YOUNG MAN OF FASHION IN 1597 DESCRIBES THE DELICACIES WITH WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO INDULGE HIS APPETITE AND ADDS THAT HAVING EATEN HE QUAFFS A WHOLE TUNNEL OF TOBACCO SMOKE
APPERSON I.S.O
IT IS SAYED THAT HE WITH CAPTAIN THOMAS PRICE OF PLASYOLLIN AND ONE CAPTAIN KOET WERE THE FIRST WHO SMOKED OR AS THEY CALLED IT DRANK TOBACCO PUBLICKLY IN LONDON
AND IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT BY THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE SMOKING THOUGH STILL EXTENSIVELY PRACTISED IN MANY CLASSES OF SOCIETY WAS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OUT OF VOGUE AMONG THOSE MOST AMENABLE TO THE DICTATES OF FASHION
IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE IMPROPRIETY OF THEIR CONDUCT
THE APPRECIATIVE LINES RUN THUS
THE CHURCHWARDENS ACCOUNTS OF ST MARY LEICESTER 1665-6 RECORD THE EXPENDITURE--"IN BEER AND TOBACCO FROM FIRST TO LAST 7S
BUT COURTIERS HATE THE PUFFING TUBE--NO MATTER STRANGE IF THEY LOVE THE BREATH THAT CANNOT FLATTER YET CROWDS REMAIN WHO STILL ITS WORTH PROCLAIM WHILE SOME FOR PLEASURE SMOKE AND SOME FOR FAME THE SATIRIST WROTE TRULY THAT AFTER ALL THE FASHIONABLE ABSTAINERS HAD BEEN DEDUCTED CROWDS REMAINED WHO SMOKED AS HEARTILY AS THEIR PREDECESSORS OF A CENTURY EARLIER

SOMETIMES APPARENTLY THEY CHEWED
THE ORIGINAL GARRICK CLUB-HOUSE WAS AT 35 KING STREET COVENT GARDEN WHERE THE CLUB WAS FOUNDED IN 1831
ONE CANNOT IMAGINE THE AUTHOR OF THE COUNTERBLASTE COUNTENANCING THE USE OF TOBACCO UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
TO SMOKE IN THE PRESENCE OF A LADY WAS AN INCONCEIVABLE OUTRAGE
GOOD BOY IN THE SAME POCKET-BOOK ONE OF THE IDEALS OF A WIFE BY A BACHELOR IS--"TO APPROVE OF SMOKING ALL OVER THE HOUSE
CONSIDERING THE RATE AT WHICH STAGE-COACHES NOW TRAVEL I.E IN AND JUST BEFORE 1830
BUT EXCESS IS SELF-CONDEMNED
THE SATIRICAL DEKKER MIGHT CLASS TOBACCONISTS WITH FEATHER-MAKERS COBWEB-LAWNE-WEAVERS PERFUMERS YOUNG COUNTRY GENTLEMEN AND FOOLS BUT HE BEARS INVALUABLE WITNESS TO THE DEVOTION OF THE FASHIONABLE MEN OF THE DAY TO THE COSTLYE AND GENTLEMAN-LIKE SMOAK IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR A MAN TO CARRY A CASE OF PIPES ABOUT WITH HIM
BEFORE THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HOWEVER THE SIGNS WERE CEASING TO HAVE ANY NECESSARY ASSOCIATION WITH THE TRADE CARRIED ON UNDER THEM AND TOBACCONISTS ARE FOUND WITH SHOP-SIGNS WHICH HAD NO REFERENCE IN ANY WAY TO TOBACCO
JUST AT FINMORE'S AN ALEHOUSE THE CONDITIONS WERE THAT ANY ONE MAN OR WOMAN WHO COULD SMOKE OUT THREE OUNCES OF TOBACCO FIRST WITHOUT DRINKING OR GOING OFF THE STAGE SHOULD HAVE 12S
THIS IS THE EARLIEST REFERENCE I HAVE FOUND TO CIGARETTE-SMOKING IN ENGLAND
PERHAPS THE MOST NOTEWORTHY THING ABOUT SMOKING AT THIS PERIOD FROM THE SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW WAS ITS FASHIONABLENESS
THE EXPLANATION IS AS FOLLOWS
THIS STRIP IS NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF THE WIDTH OF THE INSTRUMENT AND EXTENDS UP THE MIDDLE ABOUT TWO-FIFTHS OF THE LENGTH OF THE BODY OF IT
THE BLACK BOY EXISTED AS A SHOP-SIGN BEFORE TOBACCO'S TRIUMPH FOR HENRY MACHYN IN HIS DIARY SO EARLY AS DECEMBER 30 1562 MENTIONS A GOLDSMITH DWELLYING AT THE SENE OF THE BLAKE BOY IN THE CHEEP
IT WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF AFTER-DINNER SMOKING THAT LARGELY HELPED TO KILL THE BAD OLD PRACTICE OF CONTINUED AFTER-DINNER DRINKING
THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE APART FROM JOHNSON'S DICTUM THAT IN THE LATTER PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SMOKING HAD GONE OUT IN MRS CLIMENSON'S PASSAGES FROM THE DIARIES OF MRS LYBBE POWYS WE HEAR OF A BUNDLE OF PAPERS AT HARDWICK HOUSE NEAR WHITCHURCH OXON WHICH BEARS THE UNVARNISHED TITLE DICK'S DEBTS THIS DICK WAS A CAPTAIN RICHARD POWYS WHO HAD A COMMISSION IN THE GUARDS AND DIED AT THE EARLY AGE OF TWENTY-SIX IN THE YEAR 1768
RAMSEY A.R.I.B.A DESCRIBES AS PROBABLY THE FINEST ROOM OF ITS KIND IN LONDON IS THE TEMPLE OF SAINT NICOTINE
I DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ENTER INTO THE ETHICAL PART OF THIS MATTER BUT THIS MUCH I SAY
THAT WAS RESERVED FOR THE SECLUDED APARTMENT AFTER THE LADIES HAD GONE TO BED
THERE ARE FEW RESTAURANTS NOW IN WHICH SMOKING IS NOT ALLOWED AFTER DINNER
IN SHADWELL'S BURY FAIR OF THAT DATE LADY FANTAST SAYS TO HER HUSBAND MR OLDWIT WHO LOVES TO TELL OF HIS EARLY MEETINGS WITH BEN JONSON AND OTHER LITERARY HEROES OF A BYGONE DAY WHILE ALL THE BEAU MONDE AS MY DAUGHTER SAYS ARE WITH US IN THE DRAWING-ROOM YOU HAVE NONE BUT ILL-BRED WITLESS DRUNKARDS WITH YOU IN YOUR SMOKING-ROOM AS MR OLDWIT HIMSELF IN ANOTHER SCENE OF THE SAME PLAY SAYS TO HIS FRIENDS WE'LL INTO MY SMOKING-ROOM AND SPORT ABOUT A BRIMMER THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME EXCUSE FOR HIS WIFE'S REMARK
HE LIVED AT CAMBRIDGE AND THE DONS AND RESIDENTS THERE AS AT OXFORD NOT TO SPEAK OF THE UNDERGRADUATES WERE AS PARTIAL TO THEIR PIPES AS THE MEN WHO WENT OUT FROM AMONG THEM TO BECOME COUNTRY PARSONS AND TO SHARE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE'S LIKING FOR TOBACCO
NOW HE DRAWETH FORTH HIS TINDER-BOX AND HIS TOUCHWOOD AND FALLETH TO HIS TACKLINGS
APIECE
AND IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK THAT EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY THERE ARE PEOPLE IN WHOM A FEELING OF REVERENCE AND DECENCY IS SO FAR LACKING AS TO LEAD THEM TO DESECRATE PLACES OF WORSHIP
ON A FULL NIGHT IT IS GENERALLY THRONGED TOWARDS TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH SMOKERS
ROWLANDSON HIMSELF SMOKED AND SO DID HIS BROTHER CARICATURIST GILLRAY
BUT INSTEAD OF THE SOBER SEDENTARY PIPE THE AMBULATORY CIGAR IS CHIEFLY USED CROKER'S SHREWD SUGGESTION WAS PROBABLY NOT FAR WIDE OF THE TRUTH
AND WHEN DINNER WAS FINISHED SHELDON WE ARE TOLD RETIRED TO HIS WITHDRAWING-ROOM WHILE EACHARD WENT WITH THE CHAPLAINS AND ANOTHER CONVIVE TO THEIR LODGINGS TO DRINK AND SMOAK IF THE RESTORED KING DID NOT HIMSELF SMOKE TOBACCO WAS FAR FROM UNKNOWN AT THE PALACE OF WHITEHALL
MEN AND WOMEN ARE FIGURED TOGETHER BUT IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO FIND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THESE ROUGH CUTS WITH A PIPE IN HER HAND OR AT HER MOUTH
IT IS WELL KNOWN HE WROTE TO THOSE THAT WAIT IN MY CHAMBER THAT THE SHIRTS WAISTCOATS AND OTHER GARMENTS I WEAR NEXT MY BODY ARE SWEET BEYOND WHAT EITHER CAN EASILY BE BELIEVED OR HATH BEEN OBSERVED IN ANY ELSE WHICH SWEETNESS ALSO WAS FOUND TO BE IN MY BREATH ABOVE OTHERS BEFORE I USED TO TAKE TOBACCO WHICH TOWARDS MY LATTER TIME I WAS FORCED TO TAKE AGAINST CERTAIN RHEUMS AND CATARRHS THAT TROUBLE ME WHICH YET DID NOT TAINT MY BREATH FOR ANY LONG TIME THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WAS WRITTEN ABOUT 1645 SO AS LORD HERBERT DID NOT SMOKE TILL TOWARDS THE LATTER PART OF HIS LIFE--HE DIED IN 1648--HE CLEARLY WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK TO TOBACCO IN THE FIRST ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NEW INDULGENCE
HE COMES UP EVERY TERM TO LEARN TO TAKE TOBACCO AND SEE NEW MOTIONS SOGLIARDO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HIRE A PRIVATE ROOM TO PRACTISE IN
BUT HIS NOBLE HOSPITALITY COMBINED WITH HIS HABITS OF SOBRIETY WHETHER TOBACCO FUMIGATED HIS TABLE OR NOT WOULD HAVE FILLED HIS HALL WITH THE LEARNED AND THE GOOD A PORTRAIT OF PARR HANGS IN THE COMBINATION ROOM IN ST JOHN'S CAMBRIDGE
BUT I LOVE HIM I WORSHIP HIM BECAUSE HE SLIT THE THROAT OF THAT BLACKGUARD RALEIGH WHO INVENTED THIS FILTHY SMOKING PROFESSOR BLACKIE IN A LETTER TO HIS WIFE REMARKED
SMOKING IN THE RESTORATION ERA 69 VI
577 WHICH CONTAINED A PARAGRAPH THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED THE HEART OF KING JAMES I
BUT THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT IN SOME RESPECTS AT LEAST--IN HIS ENTHUSIASM FOR SPORT AND LOVE OF ALE AND TOBACCO--WESTERN IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRY SQUIRES OF HIS DAY
HE MENTIONS ISAAC BARROW DR BARLOW OF LINCOLN WHO WAS AS REGULAR IN SMOKING TOBACCO AS AT HIS MEALS AND HAD A HIGH OPINION OF ITS VIRTUES DR ALDRICH AND OTHER CELEBRATED PERSONS WHO FLOURISHED ABOUT THIS TIME AND GAVE MUCH INTO THAT PRACTICE ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN OF THESE CELEBRATED PERSONS WAS GILBERT BURNET BISHOP OF SALISBURY FROM 1689 AND HISTORIAN OF HIS OWN TIMES
THOSE WHO SMOKED PIPES AT CAMBRIDGE CONTINUED TO SMOKE PIPES AFTERWARDS WHATEVER SOCIETY MIGHT DO
THE KING SUMMED UP IN A SPEECH WHICH HOPELESSLY BEGGED THE QUESTION WHILE IT CONTAINED PLENTY OF STRONG DENUNCIATION
AND THE MARQUISSE THEREUPON GOING TO HIS COACH HARD BY AND CALLINGE FOR A PYPE OF TOBACCO BEFORE HE COULD TAKE IT THE ENIMY CHARGED AND INSTANTLY ALL THE PRINCE'S HORSE WERE ROUTED GARDINER EVIDENTLY FOLLOWS THIS ACCOUNT FOR HIS VERSION OF THE STORY IS
IT WAS ABOUT 1859 THAT THE USE OF THE ROOT OF THE WHITE HEATH ERICA ARBOREA A NATIVE OF THE SOUTH OF FRANCE CORSICA AND SOME OTHER LOCALITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING TOBACCO-PIPES WAS INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE ARMIES OF THE PARLIAMENT WERE GREAT SMOKERS FOR THE FINDS OF SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY PIPES ON THE SITES OF THEIR CAMPS HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS
THIS GOOD MAN LIVES STRICTLY BY RULE AND EACH RETURNING DAY NE'ER SWERVES A HAIRBREADTH FROM THE SAME OLD WAY
HIS WIT PLEASED BOTH THE KING AND THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WHOM IT MOVED TO LAUGHTER
THE OLD IRISHWOMEN WHO WERE ONCE A FAMILIAR FEATURE OF LONDON STREET-LIFE AS SELLERS OF APPLES AND OTHER SMALL WARES AT STREET CORNERS WERE OFTEN HARDENED SMOKERS
YOU MUST HAVE OFTEN BEEN SURPRISED SHE CONTINUED THAT WE ENGLISH LADIES HAVE SUCH AN INVINCIBLE REPUGNANCE TO TOBACCO SMOKE BUT THERE IS NO DISPENSATION FROM OUR RULE OF ABSTINENCE EXCEPT IN THOSE ROOMS WHICH MY HUSBAND HAS ALREADY POINTED OUT TO YOU THE PROFESSOR AFTER LUNCHEON WAS PRESSED BY THE SQUIRE--"WHO ON ANY OTHER OCCASION WOULD NEVER WASTE TIME IN SMOKING AND ONLY FILLED HIS SHORT CLAY PIPE AT THE END OF HIS DAY'S WORK"--TO COME TO HIS SMOKING-ROOM
THE OBSERVANT VISITOR TO THE PROMENADE CONCERTS ANNUALLY GIVEN IN THE QUEEN'S HALL LANGHAM PLACE WILL NOTICE THAT BUT ONE SMALL SECTION OF THE GRAND CIRCLE IS RESERVED FOR NON-SMOKERS WHILE SMOKING IS FREELY ALLOWED WITH NO ABSURD BAN ON THE FRIENDLY PIPE IN EVERY OTHER PART OF THE GREAT AUDITORIUM--FLOOR CIRCLE AND BALCONY
BUT ALAS
BUT ALAS
BUT ALAS
A LARGE SNUFF-BOX USUALLY LAY ON THE TABLE BETWEEN THEM AND THEY PUSHED IT ONE TO THE OTHER
PERSONALLY I MUCH DOUBT MR DENMAN'S SUGGESTED EXPLANATIONS OF HIS HIGHLANDER'S CURIOUS IMPLEMENT
THEN CAME THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CIGAR AND THE REVIVAL OF SMOKING IN THE CIRCLES FROM WHICH IT HAD LONG BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY ABSENT
1600 A CURIOUS SCENE TOOK PLACE AT OXFORD IN 1605 WHEN KING JAMES VISITED THE UNIVERSITY
WHO FIRST SMOKED A PIPE OF TOBACCO IN ENGLAND
MRS STIRLING IN THE LETTER-BAG OF LADY ELIZABETH SPENCER-STANHOPE 1913 NOTES THAT LORD ALTHORP WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR ABOUT 1822 AT HOLKHAM THE WELL-KNOWN SEAT OF MR COKE OF NORFOLK LATER LORD LEICESTER AND THAT ON SUCH OCCASIONS HE ENJOYED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE ONLY GUEST BESIDES THE DUKE OF SUSSEX WHO EVER INDULGED IN THE RARE HABIT OF SMOKING
BUT THE PHRASE TO TAKE TOBACCO WAS AT THAT TIME QUITE COMMONLY APPLIED TO SMOKING AND CONSIDERING THE EXTRAORDINARY AND IMMODERATE USE OF TOBACCO SOON AFTER ITS INTRODUCTION IT IS NOT IN THE LEAST INCREDIBLE THAT PIPES WERE LIGHTED AT LEAST OCCASIONALLY EVEN IN SACRED BUILDINGS
THE AUCTIONEER MR STEVENS REMARKED THAT UNFORTUNATELY A PARCHMENT DOCUMENT ABOUT THE PIPE WAS LOST SOME YEARS AGO AND DECLARED IF WE COULD ONLY PRODUCE THE PARCHMENT THE PIPE WOULD FETCH L500 IN THE END HOWEVER IT WAS KNOCKED DOWN AT SEVENTY-FIVE GUINEAS
IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT WHICH WITNESSED COLERIDGE'S ADVENTURE I.E IN 1796 A TOBACCO-BOX WITH A HISTORY WAS THE SUBJECT OF A LEGAL DECISION
ONE DIFFICULTY ABOUT THIS STORY IS THE ALLEGED SECRECY OF RALEIGH'S INDULGENCE IN TOBACCO
BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE MANY MEN OF LETTERS AND ARTISTS WHO DESPISING THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY WERE LARGELY INSTRUMENTAL IN BREAKING DOWN STUPID RESTRICTIONS AND IN OVERCOMING SENSELESS PREJUDICES AND WERE THUS HERALDS OF FREEDOM
MANIE RARE AND WONDERFUL EXPERIMENTS OF THE VERTUES THEREOF
FROM THE EXAMPLES GIVEN IN BURN'S DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF LONDON TOKENS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TOBACCO ROLL WAS A WARM FAVOURITE
BULWER LYTTON MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE BRIAR BUT HE WROTE ENTHUSIASTICALLY OF THE PIPE
THE MAN ON THE LEFT ADVANCES TOWARDS THIS CENTRAL FIGURE HOLDING OUT A PIPE ABOVE WHICH IS THE LEGEND VOULE VOUS DE RAPE ABOVE THE MIDDLE MAN IS NO DIS BEEN BETTER THE THIRD MAN ON THE RIGHT HOLDS OUT ALSO TOWARDS THE CENTRAL FIGURE A TOBACCO-BOX ABOVE WHICH IS THE LEGEND WILL YOU HAVE A QUID A FREQUENT SIGN-DEVICE AMONG DEALERS IN SNUFF WAS THE CROWN AND RASP
MR J.H
SMOKING WAS FROWNED UPON EVEN IN PLACES WHERE HITHERTO IT HAD BEEN ALLOWED
AS FORTH THY CURLING FUMES ARISE THEY SEEM AN EVENING SACRIFICE AN OFFERING TO MY MAKER'S PRAISE FOR ALL HIS BENEFITS AND GRACE
I AM WRITING HERE HE SAYS AT ELEVEN AT NIGHT IN THIS FILTHIEST OF ALL FILTHY ATMOSPHERES
AND HE SMOKES WERY COMFORTABLY TILL SHE COMES TO AGIN WHAT BETTER EXAMPLE COULD THERE BE OF PIPE-ENGENDERED PHILOSOPHY
THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF WHOM LADY DOROTHY HEARD AS HAVING BEEN SEEN SMOKING A CIGAR IN THE PARK WAS THE DUKE OF SUTHERLAND AND THE LADY WHO TOLD HER SPOKE OF IT AS IF SHE HAD BEEN PRESENT AT AN EARTHQUAKE
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
ONE CAPTAIN PHILIP AMADAS ACCOMPANIED CAPTAIN BARLOW WHO COMMANDED ON THE OCCASION OF RALEIGH'S FIRST VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FORMALLY TAKEN POSSESSION OF AND NAMED VIRGINIA IN HONOUR OF QUEEN ELIZABETH
APPARENTLY THEY ARE DISCUSSING THE TAKING OF PORTOBELLO BY ADMIRAL VERNON IN 1739 WITH ONLY SIX SHIPS
I CAN ONLY GUESS THAT THE BAT WAS AT SOME TIME PRIMARILY AN EMBLEM OF A SERGEANT'S OFFICE AND SECONDARILY USED FOR THE INFLICTION OF CHASTISEMENT ON CLUMSY OR DISORDERLY RECRUITS
V SMOKING IN THE RESTORATION PERIOD THE INDIAN WEED WITHERED QUITE GREEN AT NOON CUT DOWN AT NIGHT SHOWS THY DECAY ALL FLESH IS HAY
GEORGE STARTS BY SAYING
TIME WILL SETTLE MY CONSCIENCE TIME WILL RECONCILE ME TO THIS LANGUID COMPANION ENNUI
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO QUILP WHO INSISTED ON HIS FRIEND CONTINUING TO SMOKE WHILE HE INQUIRED
THERE IS NO WARRANT OF ANY KIND FOR SEGAR THE EARLIEST MENTION OF CIGARS IN ENGLISH OCCURS IN A BOOK DATED 1735
AT THE ANNUAL PARISH FEAST HELD AT ST BRIDE'S FLEET STREET LONDON ON MAY 24 1666 THE EXPENSES INCLUDED 3D
ONE OF THEM STANDS UP ON OUR RIGHT AND VOMITS
HE DID NOT MIND A PIPE IN HIS STUDY BUT THE CIGAR WAS AN ABOMINATION TO THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN IN LIKING HIS PIPE WAS FAITHFUL TO THE TRADITIONAL FONDNESS FOR SMOKING OF PARSONS
THE DUKE OF SUSSEX
WHEN TOM OFFERS HIS BOX TO CAPTAIN HARDY THAT WORTHY'S SON SAYS
EARLY GEORGIAN DAYS LORD FOPLING SMOKES NOT--FOR HIS TEETH AFRAID
DICKENS'S LITTLE FIGURE WHICH ADORNED OLD SOL GILLS'S SHOP THRUST ITSELF OUT ABOVE THE PAVEMENT RIGHT LEG FOREMOST WITH SHOE BUCKLES AND FLAPPED WAISTCOAT VERY MUCH UNLIKE THE REAL THING AND BORE AT ITS RIGHT EYE THE MOST OFFENSIVELY DISPROPORTIONATE PIECE OF MACHINERY BUT THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF MANY LITTLE TIMBER MIDSHIPMEN IN OBSOLETE NAVAL UNIFORMS ETERNALLY EMPLOYED OUTSIDE THE SHOP-DOORS OF NAUTICAL INSTRUMENT-MAKERS IN TAKING OBSERVATIONS OF THE HACKNEY-COACHES ALL HAVE DISAPPEARED TOGETHER WITH THE BLACK DOLLS OF THE RAG SHOPS AND MANY OTHER OLD-TIME FIGURES
GROSLEY IN HIS TOUR TO LONDON 1765 SAYS THAT THERE WERE REGULAR CLUBS WHICH WERE HELD IN COFFEE-HOUSES AND TAVERNS AT FIXED DAYS AND HOURS WHEN WINE BEER TEA PIPES AND TOBACCO HELPED TO AMUSE THE COMPANY
TOBACCO WAS SUPPOSED IN THOSE DAYS TO BE GOOD FOR A SURPRISING VARIETY OF AILMENTS AND DISEASES
IT IS CONSIDERED BAD FORM FOR A MAN IN A FROCK-COAT AND SILK HAT TO BE SEEN SMOKING A PIPE IN THE STREETS
FROM WHICH ONE IS INCLINED TO SURMISE THAT THE DOCTOR'S FIRST PIPE WAS NOT AN ENTIRE SUCCESS
A BARREL
BOTH MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE ALL THEIR PIPES OF TOBACCO IN THEIR MOUTHS AND SOE SIT ROUND THE FIRE SMOAKING WHICH WAS NOT DELIGHTFUL TO ME WHEN I WENT DOWN TO TALK WITH MY LANDLADY FOR INFORMATION OF ANY MATTER AND CUSTOMES AMONGST THEM WHAT WOULD KING JAMES HAVE THOUGHT OF THESE DEPRAVED CORNISH FOLK
A PIPE
HE POLITELY REFERS TO THAT GREAT TOBACCONIST THE PRINCE OF SMOAKE AND DARKNESS DON PLUTO
BUT TO TURN FROM THIS WORTHY EXETER CITIZEN TO MORE FAMOUS NAMES
THIS WAS WELL SHOWN IN 1732 WHEN SIR ROBERT WALPOLE PROPOSED SPECIAL EXCISE DUTIES ON TOBACCO AND BROUGHT A BILL INTO PARLIAMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS EXCISEMEN POWERS OF INQUISITION WHICH WERE MUCH RESENTED BY THE PEOPLE GENERALLY
AND WHEN IN 1866 SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WISHED TO BE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM THERE WAS MUCH PERTURBATION THE OLDER MEMBERS BITTERLY OPPOSING THE PROPOSAL
FOR THE HEINOUS OFFENCE OF ALLOWING A BROTHER PARISHIONER TO SMOKE IN HIS HOUSE
FOR TWO OUNCES OF TOBACCO I.E AT THE RATE OF 8S
AND IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT THE CREDIT OR DISCREDIT AS THE READER PLEASES OF BRINGING THEM INTO GENERAL AND ESPECIALLY INTO FASHIONABLE USE HAS BEEN RIGHTLY GIVEN TO LAURENCE OLIPHANT
DR SHIPLEY IN HIS RECENT MEMOIR OF JOHN WILLIS CLARK THE CAMBRIDGE REGISTRARY SAYS THAT EVEN IN THE SEVENTIES OF THE LAST CENTURY THERE WAS AN ELDERLY DON AT CAMBRIDGE WHO ONCE REBUKED A JUNIOR FELLOW WHO WAS SMOKING A PIPE IN THE WILDERNESS WITH THE REMARK NO CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN SMOKES A PIPE OR IF HE DOES HE SMOKES A CIGAR THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS BULL WAS THE SAME PARSON WHO MARRIED LATE IN LIFE AND RETURNING TO HIS CHURCH AFTER A HONEYMOON OF SIX WEEKS PUBLICLY THANKED GOD FOR THREE WEEKS OF UNALLOYED CONNUBIAL BLISS XII SMOKING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SWEET WHEN THE MORN IS GREY
JOREVIN WHOSE RARE BOOK OF TRAVELS WAS PUBLISHED AT PARIS IN 1672 WAS WANDERING IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND ABOUT THE YEAR 1666 AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS JOURNEY STAYED AT THE STAG INN AT WORCESTER WHERE HE FOUND HE HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH THE FAMILY OF HIS HOSTESS
THERE IS A TRADITION THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH HERSELF ONCE SMOKED--WITH UNPLEASANT RESULTS
MOST MEN OF MIDDLE AGE CAN REMEMBER WHEN THE SNUFF-TAKING HIGHLANDER WAS THE USUAL ORNAMENT TO THE ENTRANCE OF A TOBACCONIST'S SHOP
IS IT GOOD BRASS IS IT NICE IS IT FRAGRANT DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE GRAND TURK BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE NUMBER OF SMOKERS HAD SO LARGELY INCREASED AND WAS CONTINUALLY INCREASING SMOKING WAS REGARDED SOCIALLY AS SOMETHING OF A VICE--TO BE PRACTISED IN INCONVENIENT PLACES AND NOT TOO PUBLICLY
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT TOBACCO--F.W
THERE WAS THE LORDS ROOM OVER THE STAGE WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE CORRESPONDED WITH THE MODERN STAGE BOXES THE PRICE OF ADMISSION TO WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A SHILLING WHERE THE PIPE WAS ALSO IN FULL BLAST
THE BEST IN EUROPE T COST ME TEN CROWNES AN OUNCE BY THIS VAPOUR AN AMUSING EXAMPLE OF THE BRAGGING TOBACCONIST IS PICTURED FOR US IN BEN JONSON'S BOBADIL BOBADIL MAY PERHAPS BE SOMEWHAT OF AN EXAGGERATED CARICATURE BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE DRAMATIST IN DRAWING HIM SIMPLY EXAGGERATED THE CHARACTERISTIC TRAITS OF MANY SMOKERS OF THE DAY
I THINK CIGARETTES ARE APT TO PROVE INJURIOUS HE SAID BECAUSE A MAN WILL SMOKE FAR TOO MUCH WHEN HE INDULGES IN THIS FORM OF THE WEED AND BECAUSE I THINK IT IS GENERALLY ADMITTED THAT CIGARETTES ARE APT TO PRODUCE EVIL EFFECTS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE AMOUNT OF TOBACCO WHICH IS APPARENTLY CONSUMED EXCESS CAN EQUALLY BE FOUND AMONG CIGAR AND PIPE-SMOKERS
BUT IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HAD SMOKING NOT BEEN A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG NOBLE LORDS
BUT IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO THE CIGAR AND THE CHANGING ATTITUDE OF FASHION TOWARDS SMOKING
WHEREVER RALEIGH IS KNOWN TO HAVE LIVED OR LODGED WE ARE SURE TO FIND THE TRADITION FLOURISHING THAT THERE HE SMOKED HIS FIRST PIPE
HE RETURNED IN 1586 AND IN 1588 PUBLISHED THE RESULTS OF HIS RESEARCHES IN A THIN QUARTO WITH AN EXTREMELY LONG-WINDED TITLE BEGINNING A BRIEFE AND TRUE REPORT OF THE NEW FOUND LAND OF VIRGINIA AND CONTINUING FOR A FURTHER 138 WORDS
TO CHEW MIGHT BE MANLY BUT IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT SMOKING IS NOT MENTIONED
THAT NO MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DO PRESUME TO SMOKE TOBACCO IN THE GALLERY OR AT THE TABLE OF THE HOUSE SITTING AS COMMITTEES I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE AUTHORITY FOR THIS ORDER MAY BE BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SMOKING WAS PRACTISED IN THE PRECINCTS OF THE HOUSE
LATER VERSIONS TURN THE ALE INTO WATER AND OTHERWISE VARY THE STORY
ANOTHER PROOF OF THE EXTRAORDINARY POPULARITY OF THE NEW HABIT IS TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT BY THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF JAMES I--THE ARCH-ENEMY OF TOBACCO--THAT IS BY 1620 THE SOCIETY OF TOBACCO-PIPE-MAKERS HAD BECOME SO VERY NUMEROUS AND CONSIDERABLE A BODY THAT THEY WERE INCORPORATED BY ROYAL CHARTER AND BORE ON THEIR SHIELD A TOBACCO PLANT IN FULL BLOSSOM
MEN GO LARGELY BECAUSE THEY CAN SMOKE DURING THE PERFORMANCE
WHEN HE AND PARR GOT TOGETHER SUMNER WAS IN THE HABIT OF REFILLING HIS PIPE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BE UNOBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME BEGGING PARR NOT TO DEPART TILL HE HAD FINISHED HIS PIPE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT DETAIN HIM WE ARE TOLD IN THE EVENING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
HE PROVIDES ALL THINGS BUT PIPES TOBACCO CANDLES AND BEER"--WHICH APPARENTLY FELL TO THE LOT OF SOME OTHER CATERER
HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN INVETERATE SMOKER AND WAS CARICATURED WITH A LONG CLAY STUCK THROUGH THE BRIM OF THE SHOVEL HAT ON THE BREADTH OF WHICH KING WILLIAM ONCE MADE REMARK
LAURENCE OLIPHANT WHO WAS BOTH A MAN OF LETTERS AND A MAN OF FASHION IS GENERALLY CREDITED WITH THE INTRODUCTION INTO ENGLISH SOCIETY OF THE CIGARETTE
AT ALL EVENTS TOBACCO WAS NOT BANISHED
IT CORRECTS THE AIR BY FUMIGATION AND IT AVOIDS CORRUPT HUMOURS BY SALIVATION
THERE YOU MIGHT SEE GRAVE WITS WHO SPENDING FARTHINGS FOUR SIT SMOKE AND WARM THEMSELVES AN HOUR THE ALLUSIONS IN THE SPECTATOR TO SMOKING IN THE COFFEE-HOUSES ARE FREQUENT
A FURTHER STEP FORWARD OR BACKWARD ACCORDING TO EACH READER'S JUDGMENT WAS TAKEN ON JULY 21 1913 WHEN SMOKING WAS ALLOWED AT THE SITTING OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON SCOTTISH BILLS--ONE OF THE COMMITTEES WHICH DOES NOT CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS IN PRIVATE
THE WORD BRIER OR BRIAR HAS NO CONNEXION WHATEVER WITH THE PRICKLY THORNY BRIAR WHICH BEARS THE LOVELY WILD ROSE
THE VARINAES KIND DR BRUSHFIELD SUGGESTS WAS OBTAINED FROM VARINA NEAR THE FOOT OF THE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS FORMING THE WEST BOUNDARY OF VENEZUELA AND WATERED BY A BRANCH OF THE ORINOCO RIVER
HE OBJECTED TO THE MEDICINAL USE OF TOBACCO AND QUITE AGREED WITH PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THAT SUCH A USE MUST HAVE ARISEN AMONG BARBARIANS AND INDIANS WHO HE WENT ON TO SAY HAD AS MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE AS THEY HAD OF CIVILIZED CUSTOMS
WILLIS THE AMERICAN AUTHOR OF MANY BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND GOSSIP
I WAS TOTALLY OUT OF CASE TO ATTEND HIS SUMMONS REDOLENT AS I WAS OF TOBACCO
THESE ALE-HOUSES WERE VISITED BY THE INFERIOR TRADESMEN MECHANICS JOURNEYMEN PORTERS COACHMEN CARMEN SERVANTS AND OTHERS WHOSE POCKETS WERE NOT EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF A GLASS OF WINE WHICH APPARENTLY WAS THE MORE USUAL THING TO CALL FOR AT A TAVERN PROPERLY SO CALLED
AT 11 THE RECKONING WAS CALLED FOR AND EACH PERSON PAID 2S THERE WAS CLEARLY NO PREJUDICE AGAINST SMOKING AT CAMBRIDGE
RESPECTABLE FOLK IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED AT THE IDEA OF A PIPE OR A CIGAR BETWEEN FEMININE LIPS
IN THE FRONTISPIECE WHICH HOGARTH DREW IN 1762 FOR GARRICK'S FARCE OF THE FARMER'S RETURN FROM LONDON THE WORTHY FARMER SEATED IN HIS GREAT CHAIR HOLDS OUT A LARGE MUG IN ONE HAND TO BE FILLED WITH ALE WHILE THE OTHER SUPPORTS HIS LONG PIPE WHICH HE IS SMOKING WITH EVIDENT ENJOYMENT
THE FIRST HINTS OF FEMININE SMOKING IN ENGLAND MAY BE TRACED LIKE SO MANY OTHER CHANGES IN FASHION IN THE PAGES OF PUNCH
A PRECISIAN HOWEVER COULD TAKE HIS TOBACCO WITH A DIFFERENCE
YOU COULD NOT EVEN WALK WHILE HOLDING A LONG CHURCHWARDEN IN YOUR MOUTH AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SHORT CLAY WAS MOST FAVOURED BY YOUNG MEN AT SANDHURST AND THE UNIVERSITIES
HIS PLACID DAY ENDED EARLY
IT IS SAID THAT THE LATE SIR JOHN MILLAIS SMOKED A CLAY PIPE IN HIS CARRIAGE WHEN HE WAS PART OF THE FIRST JUBILEE PROCESSION OF QUEEN VICTORIA--A PERFORMANCE IF IT TOOK PLACE WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HORRIFIED HER TOBACCO-HATING MAJESTY
I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE HE GOES ON TO PROPHESY--AND FOR ONCE THE MOST GRATUITOUS OF FOLLIES HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED BY THE EVENT--THAT TOBACCO WILL CONQUER
BENSON
I OBJECTED HE SAYS BOTH BECAUSE I WAS ENGAGED TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH A MINISTER AND HIS FRIENDS AND BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SMOKED EXCEPT ONCE OR TWICE IN MY LIFE-TIME AND THEN IT WAS HERB TOBACCO MIXED WITH ORONOOKO
HE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BEST ROOM AND LEFT WITH THE PROOF ON HIS TABLE

IN A PLAY BY FIELD OF 1618 A FOOLISH NOBLEMAN IS ASKED BY SOME BOON COMPANIONS IN A TAVERN
BUT WITH REGARD TO HABITUAL SMOKING HE WAS A WORTHY FOLLOWER OF KING JAMES THE STRENGTH OF WHOSE LANGUAGE HE SOUGHT TO EMULATE AND EXCEED WHEN HE DENOUNCED THE COMMON TAKING OF TOBACCO BY MOST MEN WHICH TAKE IT AS TINKERS DO ALE"--AS A PLAGUE A MISCHIEF A VIOLENT PURGER OF GOODS LANDS HEALTH HELLISH DEVILISH AND DAMNED TOBACCO THE RUIN AND OVERTHROW OF BODY AND SOUL NO ANTI-TOBACCONIST COULD WISH FOR A MORE WHOLE-HEARTED DENUNCIATION THAN THAT

THERE WAS THE FAMILY TEA-TABLE AND THERE WERE THE ETERNAL CIGARETTES

AMAZING
BY WAY OF RELIEVING MY EMBARRASSMENT ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN BEGAN THE CONVERSATION WITH HAVE YOU SEEN A PAPER TO-DAY MR COLERIDGE SIR I REPLIED RUBBING MY EYES I AM FAR FROM CONVINCED THAT A CHRISTIAN IS PERMITTED TO READ EITHER NEWSPAPERS OR ANY OTHER WORKS OF MERELY POLITICAL AND TEMPORARY INTEREST THIS REMARK SO LUDICROUSLY INAPPOSITE TO OR RATHER INCONGRUOUS WITH THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I WAS KNOWN TO HAVE VISITED BIRMINGHAM AND TO ASSIST ME IN WHICH THEY WERE ALL MET PRODUCED AN INVOLUNTARY AND GENERAL BURST OF LAUGHTER
FOR TOBACCO FOR TWENTY OR MORE ADULTS
AND THAT THOUGH HE LIKED THE TRAYS VERY MUCH HE THOUGHT THEM HARDLY LARGE ENOUGH TO SERVE AS SHIELDS
BUT THE ROYAL FROWN WAS WITHOUT EFFECT
SIR WALTER SCOTT OFTEN SMOKED CIGARS THOUGH HE SEEMS TO HAVE REGARDED IT IN THE LIGHT OF AN INDULGENCE TO BE HALF-APOLOGIZED FOR
THE HIGHLANDER AS HE EXISTED WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AT MANY SHOP DOORS AND AS HE STILL EXISTS AT A FEW WAS AND IS THE SURVIVOR OF MANY SIMILAR WOODEN FIGURES AS TRADE SIGNS
THIS HE DID ALL HIS LIFE BUT AS THE MIXTURE HE TOOK WAS NOT TECHNICALLY SNUFF HE NEVER OWNED THAT HE TOOK SNUFF
IN THOSE DAYS ATLANTIC PASSAGES WERE LONG AND MIGHT LAST FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND PASSENGERS PROVISIONED THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY
I AM NOT IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT IS CALLED A LADIES MAN HAVING CONTRACTED AN IRREPRESSIBLE HABIT OF SMOKING AFTER DINNER WHICH HAS OBLIGED ME TO GIVE UP A GREAT DEAL OF THE DEAR CREATURES SOCIETY
AT THIS PERIOD THERE IS NONE THAT IS GOOD TO BE HAD FOR MONEY

A JEW PEDLAR OR MENDICANT FOREIGNER WITH HIS CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH HAS IT IN HIS POWER TO TURN THE DRAFT OF SWEET AIR INTO A CUP OF BITTERNESS PERHAPS ANGELO'S OBJECTION WAS MORE TO THE QUALITY OF THE CIGAR THAT WOULD BE SMOKED BY A JEW PEDLAR OR MENDICANT FOREIGNER THAN TO THE CIGAR ITSELF

FRIDAY
A MAN MIGHT SMOKE A CIGAR BUT HE MUST NOT TAKE THE ODOUR INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM OF EVEN AN OLD FRIEND
ANOTHER SIGN OF THE COMPLETE CHANGE WHICH HAS COME OVER THE ATTITUDE OF MOST FOLK TOWARDS TOBACCO IS TO BE SEEN IN THE PERMISSION OF SMOKING AT MEETINGS OF COMMITTEES AND COUNCILS WHERE NOT SO LONG AGO SUCH AN INDULGENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS AN OUTRAGE
ON WEDNESDAY APRIL 16 1621 IN THE COURSE OF A DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SIR WILLIAM STROUD WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A WORTHY DISCIPLE OF THAT TOBACCO-HATER KING JAMES I MOVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TOBACCO BANISHED WHOLLY OUT OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT IT MAY NOT BE BROUGHT IN FROM ANY PART NOR USED AMONGST US
MANY OF THE COMMITTEES OF MUNICIPAL COUNCILS AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES NOW PERMIT SMOKING WHILE BUSINESS IS PROCEEDING
TOBACCO IN QUEEN ANNE'S TIME STILL MAINTAINED ITS HOLD OVER LARGE CLASSES OF THE PEOPLE AND WAS STILL DOMINANT IN MOST PLACES OF PUBLIC RESORT
THE ASSERTION HAS BEEN MADE OF HIS BIRTHPLACE HAYES BARTON ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL IF HE EVER VISITED THE PLACE AFTER HIS PARENTS LEFT IT SOME YEARS BEFORE THEIR SON HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH TOBACCO
IN MISS BURNEY'S EVELINA 1778 FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE BOOK THERE IS NO MENTION WHATEVER OF TOBACCO OR OF SMOKING
THE SOLDIERS YEARNED FOR A PIPE AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AND SMOKED DRY LEAVES AS THE ONLY SUBSTITUTE THEY COULD OBTAIN MR L.E.R
HE CANNOT PUT IT THROUGH HIS NOSE HIS LORDSHIP WAS APPARENTLY NOT WELL VERSED IN THE SLIGHTS TAKING TOBACCO WAS CLEARLY AN ACCOMPLISHMENT TO BE STUDIED SERIOUSLY
IF HE HAPPEN ONCE IN A WAY TO HAVE NOTHING SPECIAL TO DO AND PLENTY OF TIME IN WHICH TO DO IT HE NATURALLY FILLS HIS PIPE AS HE DRAWS THE EASY-CHAIR ON TO THE HEARTHRUG AND KNOWS NOT THAT HE IS LONELY

I PRAY SEND MEE SUM THIS WEEKE
THE PRACTICE WAS HEDGED ABOUT AND OBSTRUCTED BY A HOST OF RESTRICTIONS AND CONVENTIONS BUT AS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ADVANCED THE TRIUMPHANT PROGRESS OF TOBACCO BECAME MORE AND MORE MARKED
IT IS THE TORRID ZONE THAT SCORCHES THE FACE AND TOBACCO THE GUNPOWDER THAT BLOWS IT UP THE DRUGGIST-TOBACCONISTS WERE WELL STOCKED WITH ABUNDANCE OF PIPES--THOSE KNOWN AS WINCHESTER PIPES WERE HIGHLY POPULAR--WITH MAPLE BLOCKS FOR CUTTING OR SHREDDING THE TOBACCO UPON JUNIPER WOOD CHARCOAL FIRES AND SILVER TONGS WITH WHICH THE HOT CHARCOAL COULD BE LIFTED TO LIGHT THE CUSTOMER'S PIPE

WHEN THE PROFESSOR ARRIVED HIS HOST THE FIRST GREETING OVER AT ONCE POINTED OUT TO HIM A SECLUDED APARTMENT--THE ONE WHICH HE THOUGHT IT MOST IMPORTANT FOR A GERMAN TO KNOW NAMELY THE SMOKING-ROOM
THE FINEST WERE MADE IN FRANCE AND THE FAVOURITE BRAND WAS FIOLET SAINT OMER I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS KIND IS STILL SMOKED BUT IT WAS MADE OF A SOFT CLAY THAT EASILY COLOURED

THIS STINKING TOBACCO KILLS MEN
IT HAS BOSSES OF LIONS HEADS AT THE ENDS AND A PORTRAIT IN RELIEF ON THE FRONT OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IN HIS PLUMED COCKED HAT
CAMPBELL IN HIS HISTORY OF VIRGINIA SAYS THAT RALEIGH HAVING OFFERED HER MAJESTY SOME TOBACCO TO SMOKE AFTER TWO OR THREE WHIFFS SHE WAS SEIZED WITH A NAUSEA UPON OBSERVING WHICH SOME OF THE EARL OF LEICESTER'S FACTION WHISPERED THAT SIR WALTER HAD CERTAINLY POISONED HER
THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY DIARIST ABRAHAM DE LA PRYME SAYS THAT HE HAD HEARD OF A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER WHO WAS SO PRECISE THAT HE WOULD NOT AS MUCH AS TAKE A PIPE OF TOBACCO BEFORE THAT HE HAD FIRST SAYED GRACE OVER IT GEORGE WITHER ONE OF THE MOST NOTEWORTHY OF THE POETS WHO TOOK THE SIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS CONFINED IN NEWGATE AFTER THE RESTORATION AND FOUND COMFORT IN HIS PIPE
DR FARMER WAS ELECTED MASTER OF EMMANUEL IN 1775
THERE IS A MYTH THAT SIR WALTER RALEIGH LANDED AT PENZANCE QUAY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM VIRGINIA AND ON IT SMOKED THE FIRST TOBACCO EVER SEEN IN ENGLAND BUT FOR THIS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST FOUNDATION

THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF IT OCCURS IN THE JESTS ATTRIBUTED TO RICHARD TARLETON THE FAMOUS COMIC PERFORMER OF THE ELIZABETHAN STAGE WHO DIED IN 1588--THE YEAR OF THE ARMADA

THERE IS MUCH WISDOM IN ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON'S REMARKS IN VIRGINIBUS PUERISQUE"--"LASTLY AND THIS IS PERHAPS THE GOLDEN RULE NO WOMAN SHOULD MARRY A TEETOTALLER OR A MAN WHO DOES NOT SMOKE
IN THIS DIARY COVERING THE YEARS 1631-43 THERE ARE SOME FORTY ENTRIES CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF WHAT IS ALWAYS SAVE IN ONE CASE CALLED TOBACKA THESE ENTRIES GIVE VALUABLE INFORMATION AS TO THE PRICES OF THE TWO CHIEF KINDS OF TOBACCO
A LARGE WAINSCOTED UNCARPETED PLACE WITH TABLES COVERED WITH GREEN BAIZE AND WRITING MATERIALS
AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE INDEED IF THE OWNER OF THE NOBLE HOUSE DID NOT OFTEN SMOKE A CONTEMPLATIVE PIPE IN THE WINDOW OF THAT PLEASANT TURRET
HACKWOOD WE LEARN THAT THE JOVIAL PARTY CONSISTED OF WILLIAM HONE GEORGE CRUIKSHANK JOSEPH GOODYEAR AND DAVID SAGE WHO JOINTLY SIGNED A HUMOROUS MEMORANDUM OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS ON THE OCCASION FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT EACH OF US SMOKED A PIPE THAT IS TO SAY EACH OF US ONE OR MORE PIPES OR LESS THAN ONE PIPE AND THE UNDERSIGNED GEORGE CRUIKSHANK HAVING SMOKED PIPES INNUMERABLE OR MORE OR LESS AND THAT SEVERAL POTS OF PORTER IN AID OF THE SAID SMOKING WERE CONSUMED FOLLOWED BY BOWLS OF NEGUS MADE FROM PORT WINE 3S
GOOD FRIENDS AND GOOD SMOKERS BOTH PREFACE THIS IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF SMOKING IN THIS COUNTRY FROM THE SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW
THE MOST SURPRISING CLAIM PERHAPS IS THAT OF PENZANCE FOR WHICH THERE IS REALLY NO EVIDENCE AT ALL
THEY HAD THEIR SMOKING-ROOMS TOO
MANY INSTANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED OF THE FINDING OF PIPES RESEMBLING THOSE USED FOR TOBACCO-SMOKING IN ELIZABETHAN TIMES IN POSITIONS AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD SEEM TO POINT TO MUCH GREATER ANTIQUITY OF USE THAN THE FORM OF THE PIPES SUPPORTS
EVELYN FEWER STILL
GRANGER LONG AGO REMARKED THAT MOST OF THE EMINENT DIVINES AND BISHOPS OF THE DAY CONTRIBUTED VERY PRACTICALLY TO THE PAYMENT OF THIS REVOLUTIONARY DEBT BY THEIR LARGE CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO
THE ANTI-TOBACCONISTS AMONG THOSE PRESENT FEW OF WHOM WERE MEN MUST HAVE SUFFERED BY THE PRACTICE
THIS BAT HAS A GILT KNOB TO THE HANDLE AND ON THE SHOULDER OF IT ARE THREE CHEVRONS IN GOLD WITHOUT DOUBT A SERGEANT'S STRIPES
ONE HAS A CIGAR IN HIS HAND AND IS BLOWING A CLOUD OF SMOKE WHILE THE OTHER IS SELECTING A WEED THE HOST IS JUST LIGHTING HIS CIGAR AS THE MAID ENTERS WITH A TRAY OF DECANTERS AND GLASSES AND WITH DISGUST WRITTEN PLAINLY ON HER FACE
PENNANT WRITING IN 1791 DESCRIBES HOW THESE MEN HUNG OUT THEIR FREQUENT SIGNS OF A MALE AND FEMALE HAND CONJOINED WITH THE LEGEND WRITTEN BELOW
AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE JACOBITE UPRISING OF 1745 THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT MADE WAR ON SCOTTISH NATIONALITY AND AMONG OTHER MEASURES THE WEARING OF THE HIGHLAND DRESS WAS FORBIDDEN BY PARLIAMENT
ANOTHER EARLY EXAMPLE OF THE STORY OCCURS IN BARNABY RICH'S IRISH HUBBUB 1619 WHERE A CERTAIN WELCHMAN COMING NEWLY TO LONDON AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SEEING A MAN SMOKING EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITH A BOWLE OF BEERE WHICH HE HAD IN HIS HAND
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT NOT A FEW OF THE DRUGGISTS WHO SOLD TOBACCO WERE GREAT RASCALS
THE EXPLANATION DOUBTLESS IS THAT THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING WAS SO VERY GENERAL AND SO MUCH A MATTER OF COURSE AMONG MEN OF ALL RANKS AND OF ALL OPINIONS THAT THE MOUTHS OF PURITANS WERE CLOSED SO TO SPEAK BY THEIR OWN PIPES
WE WONDER THAT IN CERTAIN PLACES IT SHOULD BE COMMON FOR WOMEN TO TAKE TABACCO
THIS WAS ISSUED IN 1764--HOGARTH'S LAST PUBLISHED WORK
IT LOOKS CARELESS AND WHAT IS WORSE AFFECTED
WE AGREE THAT ANY PERSON THAT IS TAKEN SMOAKEINGE TOBACCO IN THE STREET SHALL FORFITT ONE SHILLINGE FOR EVERY TIME SO TAKEN AND ITT SHALL BE LAWFULL FOR THE PETTY CONSTABBLES TO DISTRANE FOR THE SAME FOR TO BE PUTT TO THE USES ABOVESAID I.E TO THE USE OF THE TOWN WEE PRESENT NICHOLAS BAKER FOR SMOAKEINGE IN THE STREET AND DOE AMERCE HIM 1S THE SAME RULE IS REPEATED AT COURTS HELD IN THE YEARS 1696 AND 1699 BUT NO OTHER FINE IS MENTIONED AT ANY SUBSEQUENT COURTS

MISS COURTNEY WRITING IN THE FOLK-LORE JOURNAL 1887 SAYS
THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF SMOKING IN LATER VICTORIAN DAYS IS MARKED BY THE TRIUMPH OF THE CIGARETTE
TO 13S
IN 1812 THE AUTHORITIES OF SION COLLEGE ORDERED THAT COFFEE AND TEA BE PROVIDED IN THE PARLOUR FOR THE VISITORS AND INCUMBENTS AND IN THE COURT ROOM FOR THE CURATES AND LECTURERS
ANOTHER BOOKSELLER TRADED AT THE BLACK BOY IN PATERNOSTER ROW IN 1712
AND SIR GREY PALMES SAID THAT IF TOBACCO BE NOT BANISHED IT WILL OVERTHROW 100,000 MEN IN ENGLAND FOR NOW IT IS SO COMMON THAT HE HATH SEEN PLOUGHMEN TAKE IT AS THEY ARE AT PLOUGH PERHAPS THIS TERRIBLE PICTURE OF A PLOUGHMAN SMOKING AS HE FOLLOWED HIS LONELY FURROW DID NOT IMPRESS THE HOUSE SO MUCH AS SIR GREY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD
PIPE-SMOKING WAS UNFASHIONABLE--THAT IS TO SAY WAS NOT PRACTISED BY MEN OF FASHION AND WAS FOR THE MOST PART REGARDED AS LOW OR PROVINCIAL--FROM THE TIME NAMED UNTIL WELL INTO THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA
COWPER RETURNED IT TO HIM WITH THE WELL-KNOWN RHYMED EPISTLE DATED JUNE 22 1782 AND BEGINNING
LATER HIS TOBACCO COMBINED WITH INSOLENCE TO HIS TOBACCO-HATING COLONEL CONDUCTED HIM OUT OF THE ARMY INTO THE RETIREMENT OF CIVIL LIFE
RESOLVING NEVER TO MEDDLE MORE WITH IT
XV TOBACCONISTS SIGNS I WOULD ENJOIN EVERY SHOP TO MAKE USE OF A SIGN WHICH BEARS SOME AFFINITY TO THE WARES IN WHICH IT DEALS ADDISON SPECTATOR APRIL 2 1711
IT IS TRADITIONALLY SAID TO HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY THE FIGURE-HEAD OF A WAR VESSEL WHICH WAS WRECKED ON THE ALDERNEY COAST
IN PUCK WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THAT YEAR OUIDA--WHO IS HARDLY AN UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHORITY ON THE WAYS AND CUSTOMS OF FASHIONABLE FOLK THOUGH SHE LOVED TO PAINT FANCY PICTURES OF THEIR SAYINGS AND DOINGS--PICTURES THE ROW
COOPER ARE EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AS MOST OF THEM ARE BRANDED WITH THE MAKER'S INITIALS
WHENCE THEY HUMBLY HOPE THAT THEY SHALL NOT BE PUT TO THE EXPENSE OF BUYING NEW CLOATHS THIS IS NOT A VERY HUMOROUS PRODUCTION BUT AT LEAST IT BEARS WITNESS TO THE COMMON OCCURRENCE IN 1746 OF THE HIGHLANDER'S FIGURE AT THE SHOPS OF SNUFF AND TOBACCO-SELLERS
WE NEED NOT TROUBLE ABOUT THE LIBEL ACTION BUT TWO OF THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE WERE A CERTAIN GEORGE THRESHER WHO SOLD BEER AND TOBACCO AT HIS SHOPP IN ROMFORD AND A GOOD FRIEND AND CUSTOMER OF HIS NAMED ELIZABETH SAVAGE WHO SAD TO SAY WAS DESCRIBED AS MUCH GIVEN TO STRONGE DRINCKE AND TOBACCO IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL ON JUNE 8 1621 MISTRESS SAVAGE HAD TO TELL HER TALE PART OF WHICH IS REPORTED AS FOLLOWS
WHILE AT THE END OF FETTER LANE A FEW YEARS LATER JOHN NEWLAND TOBACCONIST WAS TO BE FOUND AT THE KING'S HEAD ADDISON IN THE TWENTY-EIGHTH SPECTATOR APRIL 2 1711 TOOK NOTE OF THE SEVERANCE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN SIGN AND TRADE AND OF THE ABSURDITY THAT THE SIGN NO LONGER HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE
HE SAYS
VARIOUS PLACES ARE TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RALEIGH'S FIRST PIPE
WHAT MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE COULD THERE BE FOR THE THOUGHTFUL CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO THAN AMONG THE BOOKS
THIS POUCH CONTAINS SEVERAL CLAY PIPES
THE LORDS OF THE COUNCIL TO THE CHAMBER
NOBODY RAISED THE FORMAL POINT OF ORDER
A WORLD OF 1754 POKES FUN AT THE PRETTY YOUNG MEN WHO TAKE PAINS TO APPEAR MANLY
THE WRITER OF THE MORNING POST ARTICLE REMARKED WITH MUCH FORCE AND GOOD SENSE THAT APART FROM SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT THERE IS A CERTAIN AFFINITY BETWEEN PIPES AND CLOTHES
5D
ASKED THE PRINCE WHAT HE WOULD DO
BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND DIRECT EVIDENCE THOUGH THERE ARE SUNDRY TRADITIONS AND ALLUSIONS WHICH SUGGEST THAT THE PRACTICE WAS NOT UNKNOWN
IF HE HAVE A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE HE JUST AS NATURALLY ATTACKS IT OVER A PIPE
THEY MAY HE SAYS HAVE TOLD BAD STORIES AND SUNG BAD SONGS AS THACKERAY SAYS IN HIS BOOK OF SNOBS I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I NEVER HEARD EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT CERTAINLY THERE WAS NOISE AND THERE WAS SMOKE--PLENTY OF IT
A GOOD FELLOW FOR HE WILL GIVE THE SMOAKE TO A BEGGAR
RETURN YE DAYS WHEN ENDLESS PLEASURE I FOUND IN READING OR IN LEISURE
I SHOULD SAY THAT THE BOX IS MUCH SMALLER THAN ANY OTHERS I HAVE EVER SEEN NO INFORMATION AS TO THE USE OF THIS CURIOUS BOX WAS FORTHCOMING FROM ANY OF THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS CORRESPONDENTS OF NOTES AND QUERIES
THE TWO CAPTAINS REACHED ENGLAND IN SEPTEMBER 1584 BRINGING WITH THEM THE NATIVES OF WHOM KING JAMES I IN HIS COUNTER-BLASTE TO TOBACCO SPEAKS AS SOME TWO OR THREE SAVAGE MEN WHO WERE BROUGHT IN TOGETHER WITH THIS SAVAGE CUSTOME I.E OF SMOKING
THEY KNOW NO OTHER WAY HERE FOR THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TOBACCO-PIPE THROUGHOUT NEW SPAIN CHEROOTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN KNOWN SOMEWHAT EARLIER
I HAVE MADE DELAVAL PROMISE TO SEND ME SOME BRAZIL TOBACCO FROM PORTUGAL FOR YOU MADAM DINGLEY IN DECEMBER SWIFT WAS EXPRESSING HIS HOPE THAT DINGLEY'S TOBACCO HAD NOT SPOILED THE CHOCOLATE WHICH HE HAD SENT FOR STELLA IN THE SAME PARCEL
MISSON THOUGH HE GOES ON TO PHILOSOPHIZE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF SMOKING BY THE ENGLISH CLERGY UPON THEIR THEOLOGY
THE PRACTICE OF SELLING TOBACCO IN SMALL PAPER PACKETS WAS COMMON AND MORALISTS NATURALLY HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE FATE OF AN AUTHOR'S WORK WHEN THE LEAVES OF HIS BOOKS FOUND THEIR ULTIMATE USE AS WRAPPERS FOR THE WEED

WHEN A CERTAIN YOUNG JOHN JAMES WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE OF QUEEN'S 1778 TO 1781 HE AND HIS CORRESPONDENTS SPOKE SEVERELY OF THE MISERABLE CONDITION OF FELLOWS WHO UNDER THE LIBERAL PRETENCE OF EDUCATING YOUTH SPEND HALF THEIR LIVES IN SMOKING TOBACCO AND READING THE NEWSPAPERS ABOUT 1800 THE OLDER OR MORE OLD-FASHIONED OF THE FELLOWS AT NEW COLLEGE NOT LIKING THE THEN NEWLY INTRODUCED LUXURY OF TURKEY CARPETS SAYS MR G.V

ONE NEED NOT BE MUCH SURPRISED AT ANY INSTANCE OF LACK OF REVERENCE IN ENGLISH CHURCHES DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND A FEW INSTANCES CAN BE GIVEN OF CHURCH SMOKING IN THAT ERA
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THIS CRUEL AFFLICTION NEVER ATTEMPTED THE PREMISES OF A TOBACCONIST A TANNER OR A SHOEMAKER WHATEVER GROUND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHYLACTIC EFFECT OF SMOKING THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS FIRMLY HELD
WHAT A SERMON WE HAD HERE LAST SUNDAY DICKENS AND HIS TWO DAUGHTERS--"WHO WERE DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY AS WE AGREED AFTERWARDS"--DINED BY INVITATION WITH THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

IN 1720 THE SOCIETY IN MEMORY OF THE DONOR ORNAMENTED THE LID WITH A SILVER RIM
MUCH ABSURDITY WAS WRITTEN IN GLORIFICATION OF THE MEDICINAL AND THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES OF TOBACCO BUT A MORE SENSIBLE NOTE WAS STRUCK BY SOME LAUDERS OF THE WEED
CONVERSATION THERE WAS NONE SAYS J ONLY A NOISE
THE TURK'S HEAD IN GERRARD STREET WAS THE MEETING-PLACE FOR A KNOT OF WORTHIES PRINCIPALLY SONS OF ST LUKE OR THE CHILDREN OF THESPIS AND MOSTLY VOTARIES OF BACCHUS AS THE OLD FENCING-MASTER WHO LOVED A LITTLE FINE WRITING DESCRIBES THEM

IN A SHORT TIME THE ATMOSPHERE BECAME DENSE THE DESSERT AND THE WINE CAME TO AN END AND IT WAS CHAPEL TIME MERCIFULLY ONE STORY CLARK TELLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ATTEMPT TO SMOKE

IN THE CHARACTER OF A DRUNKARD HE SAYS
C'NASTER
WHERBY THEIR BODIES ARE NOTABLY PRESERVED IN HEALTH AND KNOW NOT MANY GREEVOUS DISEASES WHEREWITHALL WEE IN ENGLAND ARE OFTENTIMES AFFLICTED SO FAR HARIOT'S REPORT REGARDED TOBACCO FROM THE MEDICINAL POINT OF VIEW ONLY
NO MAN OPENS HIS WARE WITH GREATER SERIOUSNESSE OR CHALLENGES YOUR JUDGEMENT MORE IN THE APPROBATION
AND THEN ACCORDING TO MURPHY HE RETIRED TO THE GREEN-ROOM WHERE DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE PLAY HE SMOKED HIS PIPE AND DRANK CHAMPAGNE
SUCH USE OF TOBACCO WAS CONSIDERED LOW AND WAS CONFINED TO THE CLASSES OF SOCIETY INDICATED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER
HE PRESENTED HIS FRIEND THE SPECTATOR THE SILENT GENTLEMAN WITH A TOBACCO-STOPPER MADE BY WILL WIMBLE TELLING HIM THAT WILL HAD BEEN BUSY ALL THE EARLY PART OF THE WINTER IN TURNING GREAT QUANTITIES OF THEM AND HAD MADE A PRESENT OF ONE TO EVERY GENTLEMAN IN THE COUNTY WHO HAD GOOD PRINCIPLES AND SMOKED
BUT THEY ARE NOT VERY STRONG AND WILL PROBABLY DISAPPEAR ONE OF THESE DAYS
MR HOLDEN MACMICHAEL IN HIS PAPERS ON THE LONDON SIGNS SAYS
AMONG THEM MAY BE NAMED CARMEN SYLVA THE POETESS--QUEEN OF ROUMANIA THE DOWAGER TSARITSA OF RUSSIA THE LATE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA KING ALFONSO'S MOTHER FORMERLY QUEEN-REGENT OF SPAIN THE DOWAGER QUEEN MARGHERITA OF ITALY AND EX-QUEEN AMELIE OF PORTUGAL
THE LATE MR FREDERICK GALE IN A COLUMN OF TOBACCO REMINISCENCES WHICH HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GLOBE NEWSPAPER IN 1899 SAID THAT AT VILLAGE OUTDOOR FESTIVALS OF THE THIRTIES AND EARLY FORTIES RESPECTABLE ELDERLY FARMERS AND TRADESMEN WOULD SIT ROUND A TABLE ON WHICH WAS AN AUTOMATIC SQUARE BRASS TOBACCO-BOX OF LARGE DIMENSIONS INTO WHICH THE SMOKERS DROPPED A HALFPENNY AND THE LID FLEW BACK AND THE PUBLICAN TRUSTED TO THE SMOKER'S HONOUR TO FILL HIS PIPE AND CLOSE THE BOX WHEN THE PIPES WERE FILLED THEY WERE LIGHTED BY MEANS OF TINDER-BOX AND FLINT AND A STABLE LANTHORN SUPPLIED BY THE OSTLER
IN MARKHAM'S LIFE OF THE GREAT LORD FAIRFAX THERE IS A LIVELY ACCOUNT OF HOW THE DUKE THEN MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE WITH HIS BROTHER CHARLES CAVENDISH DROVE IN A COACH AND SIX TO THE FIELD OF MARSTON MOOR ON THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE BATTLE
WHY MAN I'VE SMOKED IN THE DINING-ROOM OF EVERY NOBLEMAN IN ENGLAND
BUT MR FITZ-BOODLE'S EXPERIENCES AND REFLECTIONS THROW MUCH LIGHT ON THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF SMOKING IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
HIS MY UNCLE TOBY IS AMONG THE IMMORTALS AND TOBY WITHOUT HIS PIPE IS UNIMAGINABLE
A CONVERSE VIEW OF SMOKING MAY BE SEEN IN IZAAK WALTON'S LIFE OF SIR HENRY WOTTON WHO DIED IN 1639
HE IS CHURCHWARDEN AT HOME AND CAN'T SMOKE ANYTHING BUT A LONG CLAY WITH WHICH THE OLD SAILOR WAS ACCORDINGLY SUPPLIED
THE SMELL OF TOBACCO WAS ALWAYS THE SAME
AND THOSE WHO NEITHER KNEW NOR CARED WHETHER SUCH CONVENTIONS EXISTED OR WHAT FASHION MIGHT SAY BUT SMOKED AS AND WHAT AND WHEN AND WHERE THEY PLEASED
HE SAID IT WAS A VERY GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GENUINE ARTICLE
BULL SMOKED ORINOCO TOBACCO WHICH HE CARRIED IN ONE OF THE TOBACCO-BOXES WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WERE MUCH MORE COMMONLY USED THAN POUCHES AND THIS BOX ON ONE OCCASION HE ACCIDENTALLY LEFT BEHIND HIM AT OLNEY
GRAY'S TESTIMONY BY NO MEANS STANDS ALONE
IN 1732 THERE WAS A TOBACCO ROLL IN FINCH LANE ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CORNHILL OVER AGAINST THE SWAN AND RUMMER TAVERN IN 1766 MRS FLIGHT TOBACCONIST CARRIED ON HER BUSINESS AT THE TOBACCO ROLL
AND DINED UNTAX'D UNTROUBLED UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF OUR PIOUS FOUNDER WARTON AND ANOTHER OXFORD SMOKER OF SOME DISTINCTION--THE REV
AND WHICH IT RETAINED WITH GOOD REASON AS LONG AS IT STOOD I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ON WHAT AUTHORITY SIR JOHN CULLUM COULD HAVE MADE THE ASSERTION THAT THE ROOM WAS CALLED THE SMOKING-ROOM FROM SO EARLY A DATE AS THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
YES HE'S COMFORTABLY OFF AGREED THE OTHER
WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAR FROM THE DAYS WHEN A COMMITTEE MAN COULD DECLARE THAT NO GENTLEMAN SMOKED TO THE TIME WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THE LARGE SMOKING-ROOM AT BROOKS'S IS ONE OF THE FINEST ROOMS IN ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS AND EXCLUSIVE OF CLUBS
AND IN FIVE MINUTES THE ROOM WAS A CLOUD OF SMOKE WITH US FOUR IN THE CENTRE PULLING AWAY BRAVELY WHILE AMERICAN LADY RELATED STORIES OF HER HOOKAH UPSTAIRS AND DESCRIBED DIFFERENT KINDS OF PIPES

THE DISCUSSION NEEDLESS TO SAY BEING CONDUCTED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE COUNTERBLASTE TO TOBACCO WAS NOT FAVOURABLE TO THE HERB
IN THE FIRST TWO OR THREE DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SMOKING REACHED ITS NADIR
IT HAD BECOME HE SAYS A POINT OF GOOD-FELLOWSHIP AND HE THAT WOULD REFUSE TO TAKE A PIPE AMONG HIS FELLOWS WAS ACCOUNTED PEEVISH AND NO GOOD COMPANY YEA HE CONTINUES WITH RISING INDIGNATION THE MISTRESS CANNOT IN A MORE MANNERLY KIND ENTERTAIN HER SERVANT THAN BY GIVING HIM OUT OF HER FAIR HAND A PIPE OF TOBACCO SMOKING WAS SOON AS COMMON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN LONDON
THEIR CHEWING TOBACCO NOT ONLY OFFENDS BUT MAKES US APPREHENSIVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE POOR THINGS WILL BE SICK AS THEY CERTAINLY WELL DESERVED TO BE
ANOTHER PLACE MAKING A SIMILAR CLAIM IS HEMSTRIDGE ON THE SOMERSET AND DORSET BORDER
THEN THERE'S THE MISCELLANY HE WRITES AN APRON FOR STELLA A POUND OF CHOCOLATE WITHOUT SUGAR FOR STELLA A FINE SNUFF-RASP OF IVORY GIVEN ME BY MRS ST JOHN FOR DINGLEY AND A LARGE ROLL OF TOBACCO WHICH SHE MUST HIDE OR CUT SHORTER OUT OF MODESTY AND FOUR PAIR OF SPECTACLES FOR THE LORD KNOWS WHO THE TOBACCO WAS CLEARLY NOT FOR SMOKING BUT FOR DINGLEY TO OPERATE UPON WITH THE SNUFF-RASP AND SO SUPPLY HERSELF WITH SNUFF--A LUXURY WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS AS MUCH ENJOYED AND AS UNIVERSALLY USED BY WOMEN AS BY MEN
THE RASPS FOR OBTAINING THIS RAPE CONTINUES LARWOOD WERE CARRIED IN THE WAISTCOAT POCKET AND SOON BECAME ARTICLES OF LUXURY BEING CARVED IN IVORY AND VARIOUSLY ENRICHED
UNDER THE FAMOUS BLUE LAWS OF 1650 IT WAS ORDERED BY THE GENERAL COURT OF CONNECTICUT THAT NO ONE UNDER TWENTY-ONE WAS TO SMOKE--"NOR ANY OTHER THAT HATH NOT ALREADY ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO THE USE THEREOF AND NO SMOKER COULD ENJOY HIS PIPE UNLESS HE OBTAINED A DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATE THAT TOBACCO WOULD BE USEFULL FOR HIM AND ALLSO THAT HE HATH RECEIVED A LYCENSE FROM THE COURTE FOR THE SAME BUT THE UNHAPPY SMOKER HAVING PASSED THE DOCTOR AND OBTAINED HIS LICENCE WAS STILL HARASSED BY RESTRICTIONS FOR IT WAS ORDERED THAT NO MAN WITHIN THE COLONY AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE ORDER SHOULD TAKE ANY TOBACCO PUBLICLY IN THE STREETT HIGHWAYES OR ANY BARN-YARDES OR UPPON TRAINING DAYES IN ANY OPEN PLACES UNDER THE PENALTY OF SIX-PENCE FOR EACH OFFENCE AGAINST THIS ORDER THE INGENUITIES OF PETTY TYRANNY ARE INEFFABLE
YET THY TRUE LOVERS MORE ADMIRE BY FAR THY NAKED BEAUTIES--GIVE ME A CIGAR HOW FAR THESE LINES REALLY REPRESENT THE POET'S OWN SENTIMENTS AND WHETHER HE HABITUALLY SMOKED EITHER CIGAR OR PIPE IS ANOTHER MATTER
SYER CUMING HAS VENTURED TO INFER THAT ALMOST EVERY PERSON WHO VENTURED FROM HOME INVOKED THE PROTECTION OF TOBACCO THESE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY PIPES WERE LARGELY MADE IN HOLLAND OF PIPE-CLAY IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND--TO THE DISGUST AND LOSS OF ENGLISH PIPE-MAKERS
IN THE WHOLE SIXTEEN VOLUMES OF WALPOLE'S CORRESPONDENCE AS SO ADMIRABLY EDITED BY MRS TOYNBEE THERE IS SCARCELY A MENTION OF TOBACCO
ON THE LID OF THE BOX IS PAINTED A KEG OF TOBACCO AND TWO CLAY PIPES
IT WAS SMOKED FREELY IN THE STREETS
THIS MAN ACCORDING TO DEFOE NEVER USED ANY PRESERVATIVE AGAINST THE INFECTION OTHER THAN HOLDING GARLIC AND RUE IN HIS MOUTH AND SMOKING TOBACCO WHEN EXCAVATIONS WERE IN PROGRESS EARLY IN 1901 PREPARATORY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF KINGSWAY AND ALDWYCH THEY INCLUDED THE REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM THE BURYING-GROUNDS OF ST CLEMENT DANES AND ST MARY-LE-STRAND

AND THAT NO WINE BE AT ANY TIME CARRIED INTO THE COURT ROOM NOR ANY INTO THE HALL AFTER COFFEE AND TEA SHALL HAVE BEEN ORDERED ON THAT DAY THE USE OF TOBACCO FOR SMOKING AS I HAVE SAID HAD REACHED ITS NADIR--IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD THAT IS TO SAY--BUT THE DAWN FOLLOWS THE DARKEST HOUR AND THE REVIVAL OF SMOKING WAS AT HAND THANKS TO THE CIGAR
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY EXHILARATING IN BEING CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR WITH RAPIDITY
BUTLER WAS IN DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT TO GO AND CONSULTED HIS CLERK ALFRED ON THE MATTER
TOBACCO WAS STILL THE SYMBOL OF GOOD-FELLOWSHIP
THE WEEK-END HABIT WAS STRONG AMONG LONDON TRADESMEN IN THOSE DAYS

AND NIGHT IS SO EVIDENTLY BOUGHT OVER HE CAN'T BE A VERY UPRIGHT JUDGE
YET ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES WAS THE PERMISSION GIVEN NOT SO VERY LONG AGO TO THE DRIVERS OF TAXI-CABS TO SMOKE WHILE DRIVING FARES--A DEVELOPMENT REGARDING WHICH THERE MAY WELL BE TWO OPINIONS
SKINNER'S ON HOLBORN HILL OF THE FRONT OF WHICH THERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION IN THE ARCHER COLLECTION IN THE PRINT DEPARTMENT OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHERE THE BLACK BOY AND TOBACCO-ROLLS ARE DEPICTED OUTSIDE THE PREMISES THE BLACK BOY INDEED CONTINUED IN USE BY TOBACCONISTS UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS WELL ADVANCED

IN SOME VERSES PREFIXED TO AN EDITION OF SKELTON'S ELINOUR RUMMING WHICH APPEARED IN 1624 THE GHOST OF SKELTON WHO WAS POET-LAUREATE TO KING HENRY VIII WAS MADE TO SAY THAT HE CONSTANTLY SAW SMOKING
DIVINE IN HOOKAS GLORIOUS IN A PIPE WHEN TIPP'D WITH AMBER MELLOW RICH AND RIPE
BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT DRYDEN SMOKED
CIGARETTES WERE PRACTICALLY UNHEARD OF IN ENGLAND AND OUTSIDE ONE'S PRIVATE SMOKING-ROOM PIPES WERE TABOOED
NOR CAN I GO MUCH TO COUNTRY-HOUSES FOR THE SAME REASON THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED
SHAKESPEARE'S ABSOLUTE SILENCE ABOUT TOBACCO FORBIDS US TO ASSUME THAT HE SMOKED
PAGE 31 SAYS THAT HE HAS THREE SORTS OF TOBACCO IN HIS POCKET WHICH PROBABLY MEANS THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY TO MIX FOR SMOKING PURPOSES TOBACCO OF THE THREE USUAL KINDS--ROLL OR PUDDING LEAF AND CANE
ACCORDING TO THIS SATIRIST THE OCCUPATION OF THE MAGDALEN FELLOW WAS TO DRINK LOOK BIG SMOKE MUCH THINK LITTLE CURSE THE FREEBORN WHIG FROM WHICH IT MAY NOT UNREASONABLY BE SURMISED THAT THE AUTHOR WAS A TORY
FOR INSTANCE TO TAKE A FEW EXAMPLES FROM THE LATE MR HILTON PRICE'S LISTS OF SIGNS OF OLD LONDON FROM CHEAPSIDE AND ADJACENT STREETS IN 1695 JOHN ARUNDELL TOBACCONIST WAS AT THE WHITE HORSE WOOD STREET
SO YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE YOUR FORTY SHILLINGS NOW TOBACCO WAS ALWAYS POPULAR IN THE ARMY
MAKE CHIMNEYS A YOUR FACES BUT MANY WOMEN VIEWED TOBACCO DIFFERENTLY AS WE SHALL SEE IN THE CHAPTER ON SMOKING BY WOMEN MOREOVER THIS GOOD WOMAN HERSELF IN THE EPILOGUE TO THE BURLESQUE INVITES THE GENTLEMEN WHOM SHE HAS BEFORE ABUSED FOR SMOKING TO COME TO HER HOUSE WHERE SHE WILL ENTERTAIN THEM WITH A POTTLE OF WINE AND A PIPE OF TOBACCO HENTZNER THE GERMAN TRAVELLER WHO VISITED LONDON IN 1598 SPEAKS OF SMOKING BEING CUSTOMARY AMONG THE AUDIENCE AT PLAYS WHO WERE ALSO SUPPLIED WITH FRUITS SUCH AS APPLES PEARS AND NUTS ACCORDING TO THE SEASON CARRIED ABOUT TO BE SOLD AS WELL AS ALE AND WINE HE WAS STRUCK WITH THE UNIVERSAL PREVALENCE OF THE TOBACCO-HABIT
QUITE A PLACE ISN'T IT SAID THE AMERICAN

THE USE OF TOBACCO SPREAD WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY AMONG ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY
IT HATH AN OFFENSIVE SMELL TO SOME AND IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN ANY PERFUME TO OTHERS
THIS SAME SUSSEX SQUIRE BOUGHT A POUND OF TOBACCO IN DECEMBER 1685 FOR 20D WHICH SEEMS DECIDEDLY CHEAP AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR A 5 LB

THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING OUT OF DOORS WHICH THE EARLY VICTORIANS HELD IN PARTICULAR ABHORRENCE BECAME COMMON--AT LEAST SO FAR AS CIGARS AND CIGARETTES WERE CONCERNED
PRESUMABLY THE RECTOR BOUGHT THE MORE EXPENSIVE SPANISH TOBACCO AND THE SQUIRE THE CHEAPER VIRGINIAN
MISS JEKYLL IN HER DELIGHTFUL BOOK ON OLD WEST SURREY FIGURES AN EXAMPLE OF THESE OLD PUBLIC-HOUSE TOBACCO-BOXES WHICH IS MADE OF LEAD
PARR IS REPORTED TO HAVE ONCE ASKED LAMB HOW HE COULD SMOKE SO MUCH AND SO FAST AND LAMB IS SAID TO HAVE REPLIED--"I TOILED AFTER IT SIR AS SOME MEN TOIL AFTER VIRTUE BUT IF ALL ACCOUNTS ARE TRUE PARR FAR OUTSMOKED LAMB
IN THE STAGE-COACH OR COUNTRY INN-YARD IS SHOWN AN OLD WOMAN SMOKING A PIPE IN THE BASKET OF THE COACH
MY PEOPLE LIKE LONG HYMNS
CARLYLE AS EVERY ONE KNOWS WAS A GREAT SMOKER
IN HIS NICOTINE AND ITS RARIORA MR A.M

BUT HER MAJESTY IN A SHORT WHILE RECOVERING MADE THE COUNTESS OF NOTTINGHAM AND ALL HER MAIDS SMOKE A WHOLE PIPE OUT AMONG THEM THE QUEEN HAD NO SELFISH DESIRE TO MONOPOLIZE THE NOVEL SENSATIONS CAUSED BY SMOKING
TO BE SURE HE CONTINUED IT IS A SHOCKING THING BLOWING SMOKE OUT OF OUR MOUTHS INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S MOUTHS EYES AND NOSES AND HAVING THE SAME THING DONE TO US
WHEN MR PICKWICK AND SAM LOOK IN AT OLD WELLER'S HOUSE OF CALL OFF CHEAPSIDE THEY FIND THE BOXES FULL OF STAGE COACHMEN DRINKING AND SMOKING AND AMONG THEM IS THE OLD GENTLEMAN HIMSELF SMOKING WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE AFTER HAVING GIVEN HIS SON VALUABLE PARENTAL ADVICE MR WELLER SENIOR REFILLED HIS PIPE FROM A TIN BOX HE CARRIED IN HIS POCKET AND LIGHTING HIS FRESH PIPE FROM THE ASHES OF THE OLD ONE COMMENCED SMOKING AT A GREAT RATE A LITTLE LATER WHEN MR PICKWICK HUNTS UP PERKER'S CLERK LOWTEN AND JOINS THE JOVIAL CIRCLE AT THE MAGPIE AND STUMP HE FINDS ON HIS RIGHT HAND A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECKED SHIRT AND MOSAIC STUDS WITH A CIGAR IN HIS MOUTH WHO EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE NEWCOMER DOES NOT FIND THIS SORT OF THING DISAGREEABLE NOT IN THE LEAST REPLIED MR PICKWICK I LIKE IT VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH I AM NO SMOKER MYSELF I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO SAY I WASN'T INTERPOSES ANOTHER GENTLEMAN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
AND IN THE SAME PLAY BY THE WAY WE ARE TOLD THAT A PIPE OF RICH SMOAK WAS SOLD FOR SIXPENCE
AT THE END OF ANY DAY'S OCCUPATION ESPECIALLY ONE OF PLEASURABLE TOIL--WHETHER IT BE SHOOTING OR HUNTING OR WALKING OR WHAT NOT--WHAT CAN BE PLEASANTER THAN TO LET THE MIND MEANDER THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY'S PROCEEDINGS OVER A PIPE
AND AMONG THE BONES WERE FOUND A COUPLE OF THE CURIOUS TOBACCO-PIPES CALLED PLAGUE-PIPES BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN USED AS A PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTION BY THOSE WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO BURY THE DEAD

CELIA FIENNES WHO TRAVELLED ABOUT ENGLAND ON HORSEBACK IN THE REIGN OF WILLIAM AND MARY TELLS US THAT AT ST AUSTELL IN CORNWALL ST AUSTINS SHE CALLS IT SHE DISLIKED THE CUSTOME OF THE COUNTRY WHICH IS A UNIVERSAL SMOAKING
IN THE SECOND OF THE ELECTION SERIES--THE CANVASSING FOR VOTES 1755)--A BARBER AND A COBBLER SEATED AT THE TABLE IN THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER ARE BOTH SMOKING LONG PIPES
DOAENT YE
BUT ACCORDING TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT WHEN RUPERT TOLD HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BATTLE THE DUKE BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS COACH LIT HIS PIPE AND MAKING HIMSELF VERY COMFORTABLE FELL ASLEEP THE ORIGINAL AUTHORITY HOWEVER FOR THE WHOLE STORY IS TO BE FOUND IN A PAPER OF NOTES BY CLARENDON ON THE AFFAIRS OF THE NORTH PRESERVED AMONG HIS MSS
THERE IS A HIGHLANDER OF OAK IN THE COSTUME OF THE BLACK WATCH STILL STANDING I BELIEVE IN THE DOORWAY OF A TOBACCO SHOP AT ST HELIERS JERSEY

IT IS SOMETIMES STATED THAT AT THIS TIME SMOKING WAS GENERALLY PRACTISED IN SCHOOLS AND THAT AT A STATED HOUR EACH MORNING LESSONS WERE LAID ASIDE AND MASTERS AND SCHOLARS ALIKE PRODUCED THEIR PIPES AND PROCEEDED TO SMOKE TOBACCO
BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE MAKES NO MENTION OF COFFEE-HOUSES
A FIRE OF WOOD BURNS IN THE GRATE
IN THAT DELIGHTFUL BOOK OF PICTURES AND GOSSIP CONCERNING OLD HOUSEHOLD AND FARMING GEAR AND OLD-FASHIONED DOMESTIC PLENISHINGS OF MANY KINDS CALLED OLD WEST SURREY MISS JEKYLL FIGURES TWO PAIRS OF OLD EMBER-OR BRAND-TONGS
HE SPOKE OF THE USE OF TOBACCO AS AN UNCLEANLY AND UNWHOLESOME SELF-INDULGENCE AND DESCRIBED SNUFFING AS A SILLY NASTY DIRTY CUSTOM THE LONDON CLERGY SEEM TO HAVE SMOKED AT ONE TIME AS A MATTER OF COURSE AT THEIR GATHERINGS AT SION COLLEGE THEIR HEADQUARTERS
THE CIGAR AND THE CIGARETTE WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES OF SOCIETY AND THEIR USE HAS SPREAD DOWNWARD

THE HOT PIPES AND SMOULDERING MATCHES STAINED THE TABLE TOPS AND BURNT THE CARPETS SO THAT THEY HAD THE OPTION OF ABANDONING EITHER THE PIPE OR THE QUARTERS
THEIR SWEARING IS ALMOST AS SHOCKING AS IT WOULD BE IN THE OTHER SEX
IT IS NOT LIKELY HOWEVER THAT CIGAR-SMOKING WILL BECOME POPULAR AMONG WOMEN
AND THE COMING OF THE CIGARETTE COMPLETED WHAT THE CIGAR HAD BEGUN
THIS WAS AN INFREQUENT MATERIAL FOR TOBACCO-PIPES BUT THERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES IN MUSEUMS
ONE INFERENCE AT LEAST MAY BE FAIRLY DRAWN I THINK FROM THIS DOCUMENT AND THAT IS THAT SMOKING WAS VERY POPULAR NORTH AS WELL AS SOUTH OF THE TWEED
ON ONE OCCASION AS REPORTED BY A MEMBER OF THE FIRM THAT PRINTED THE MAGAZINE A PROOF HAD BEEN LOST AND THE POET WAS INFORMED THAT THE ARTICLE MUST GO TO PRESS NEXT DAY UNCORRECTED
MR DITCHFIELD IN HIS ENTERTAINING BOOK ON THE PARISH CLERK TELLS A STORY OF A LINCOLNSHIRE CURATE WHO WAS A GREAT SMOKER AND WHO LIKE PARR WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RETIRE TO THE VESTRY BEFORE THE SERMON AND THERE SMOKE A PIPE WHILE THE CONGREGATION SANG A PSALM

HERE WERE ASSEMBLED BACHELORS MASTERS AND DOCTORS OF MUSIC OF THE UNIVERSITY--NO PROFESSIONALS WERE EMPLOYED--WHO PERFORMED VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC TO THEIR MUTUAL GRATIFICATION THOUGH APPARENTLY NOT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE VISITOR WHO RECORDS HIS OPINION THAT THE MUSIC WAS VERY POOR IT LASTED HE SAYS TILL 11 P.M THERE WAS BESIDES SMOKING AND DRINKING OF WINE THOUGH WE DID NOT DO MUCH OF EITHER

IN ANOTHER OF THE SKETCHES THE AMUSING TUGGS'S AT RAMSGATE WHEN POOR CYMON TUGGS IS HID BEHIND THE CURTAIN HALF DEAD WITH FEAR HE HEARS CAPTAIN WATERS CALL FOR BRANDY AND CIGARS--"THE CIGARS WERE INTRODUCED
THE TOBACCO-TONGS WERE MORE PROPERLY CALLED EMBER-OR BRAND-TONGS
I DESIRE THAT HEE MAY GIVE HIS ACCOUNT FOR THE TOBACCO AS SHOWING HOW CLOSELY SIR WALTER'S NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IT LONG AFTER HIS DEATH DR BRUSHFIELD QUOTES THE FOLLOWING ENTRY FROM THE DIARY OF THE GREAT EARL OF CORK
IT MAY PERHAPS BE INTERESTING TO COMPARE WITH THESE PRICES FROM WHICH APPARENTLY IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT NEAR GLASGOW TOBACCO COULD BE BOUGHT FOR SOME 5D
PEERS AND SQUIRES AND PARSONS AND PEASANTS ALIKE SMOKED
BUT THE PROBABILITIES ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF ITS CONNEXION WITH CIGARRA THE SPANISH NAME FOR THE CICADA THE SHRILLY-CHIRPING INSECT FAMILIAR IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE SUBJECT OF FREQUENT ALLUSIONS BY THE ANCIENT WRITERS OF GREECE AND ROME AS WELL AS BY MODERN SCRIBES
BOY DRY A LEAF QUIETLY THE BOY TELLS HIM THERE'S NONE IN THE HOUSE SIR TO WHICH THE WORTHY HOST REPLIES SOTTO VOCE DRY A DOCK LEAF BUT THE DINER'S POTATIONS MUST HAVE BEEN POWERFUL IF THEY HAD LEFT HIM UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TASTE OF TOBACCO AND THAT OF DRIED DOCK-LEAF
AT HIS FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE IN THE INN KITCHEN HE CALLS FOR A PIPE OF TOBACCO BEFORE TAKING HIS PLACE AT THE FIRESIDE
THE CUSTOM IS BEFORE YOU FILL TO PUT A PENNY IN THE TILL
THIS HE DID BEFORE THE SERMON WHILE THE CONGREGATION WERE SINGING A HYMN AND APPARENTLY BOTH PARTIES WERE PLEASED FOR PARR WOULD SAY
THE ACCOMPLISHED SHIFT PROMISES A WOULD-BE PUPIL IN THE ART OF TAKING TOBACCO THAT IF HE PLEASES TO BE A PRACTITIONER HE SHALL LEARN IN A FORTNIGHT TO TAKE IT PLAUSIBLY IN ANY ORDINARY THEATRE OR THE TILTYARD IF NEED BE IN THE MOST POPULAR ASSEMBLY THAT IS THE TILTYARD ADJOINED WHITEHALL PALACE AND WAS THE FREQUENT SCENE OF SPORTS IN WHICH QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK THE GREATEST DELIGHT
IT DIDNA BECOME A WILD INDIAN HE SAID MUCH LESS A CHRISTIAN AND A GENTLEMAN TO SIT IN THE KIRK PUFFING TOBACCO-REEK AS IF HE WERE IN A CHANGE-HOUSE THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT WAS 1737
THE FORMER WAS SOON FINISHED
OTHER WELL-KNOWN MEN OF THE LATE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WERE TOBACCONISTS IN THE OLD SENSE OF THE WORD
A SMOKING-JACKET WAS WORN IN THE PLACE OF THEIR ORDINARY EVENING COAT AND THEIR WELL-OILED MASSIVE HEAD OF HAIR WAS PROTECTED BY A GORGEOUSLY DECORATED SMOKING-CAP
A LITTLE LATER THEY WERE TOO COMMON AND TOO MUCH FREQUENTED TO BE OVERLOOKED
HE PRESENTLY CALLS A FOOTMAN WHO COMES WITH A TRAY AND SUGAR-TONGS PICKS UP THE OFFENDING BRIAR WITH THE TONGS AND CARRIES IT OFF WITH AN AIR OF INEFFABLE DISGUST UNDERGRADUATES LIKE MEN OF LETTERS DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE CONVENTIONAL ATTITUDE OF SOCIETY TOWARDS TOBACCO AND PIPES MAINTAINED THEIR POPULARITY IN COLLEGE ROOMS
AS THE PRICE OF A POUND OF TOBACCO
WRITING IN THE TIME OF CHARLES II HE SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD HIS GRANDFATHER SAY THAT AT FIRST ONE PIPE WAS HANDED FROM MAN TO MAN ROUND ABOUT THE TABLE

EXTRACTS FROM THE FINANCIAL DIARY OF THIS GOOD MAN WHOSE NAME WAS JOHN HAYNE AND WHO WAS AN EXTENSIVE DEALER IN SERGES AND WOOLLEN GOODS GENERALLY AS WELL AS IN A SMALLER DEGREE OF COTTON GOODS ALSO WERE PRINTED SOME YEARS AGO WITH COPIOUS ANNOTATIONS BY THE LATE DR BRUSHFIELD
AT THE TIME OF THE DREADFUL VISITATION OF 1665 ALL THE BOYS AT ETON WERE OBLIGED TO SMOKE IN SCHOOL EVERY MORNING
THE PRINCE REGENT WAS DEVOTED TO SNUFF BUT DISDAINED TOBACCO
THERE IS SCARCE A DAY PASSES HE WROTE BUT A TRADESMAN GOES TO THE ALE-HOUSE OR TAVERN TO SMOKE WITH SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AND THEREFORE PUBLIC HOUSES ARE NUMEROUS HERE AND BUSINESS GOES ON BUT SLOWLY IN THE SHOPS
AFTER SUPPER THE POOR MAN SADLY LAMENTS THAT HE CANNOT HAVE HIS PIPE BECAUSE HIS WIFE WITH SOCIAL AMBITIONS DEEMS THAT IT IS UNGENTEEL TO SMOKE WHERE ANY LADIES ARE IN COMPANY AGAIN IN THE CONNOISSEUR'S RIVAL THE WORLD FOUNDED AND CONDUCTED BY EDWARD MOORE THERE IS A LETTER IN THE NUMBER DATED FEBRUARY 19 1756 FROM A CITIZEN WHO SAYS
THAT WISE COUNSELLOR ASKED TO LOOK AT THE BISHOP'S LETTER AND THEN SAID
HER DEATH WAS CAUSED BY THE ACCIDENTAL IGNITION OF HER CLOTHES AS SHE WAS LIGHTING HER PIPE AT THE FIRE

I KNOW HIS PRICE WHEN HE BARGAINS WITH ME

GILES MOORE RECTOR OF HORSTED KEYNES SUSSEX MADE A NOTE IN HIS JOURNAL AND ACCOUNT BOOK IN 1665 OF TOBACCO FOR MY WYFE 3D AS FROM OTHER ENTRIES IN MR MOORE'S ACCOUNT BOOK WE KNOW THAT TWO OUNCES COST HIM ONE SHILLING WE MAY WONDER WHAT MRS MOORE WAS GOING TO DO WITH HER HALF-OUNCE
I WAS YESTERDAY IN A COFFEE-HOUSE NOT FAR FROM THE ROYAL EXCHANGE WHERE I OBSERVED THREE PERSONS IN CLOSE CONFERENCE OVER A PIPE OF TOBACCO
COLTON REV
GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS
A TRAVELLER IN SPANISH AMERICA NAMED COCKBURN WHOSE NARRATIVE WAS PUBLISHED IN THAT YEAR DESCRIBES HOW HE MET THREE FRIARS AT NICARAGUA WHO HE SAYS GAVE US SOME SEEGARS TO SMOKE
JOHN NEWTON WAS A SMOKER AND SO WAS COWPER'S OTHER CLERICAL FRIEND THAT LEARNED AND ABLE DISSENTER THE REV
SWINBURNE ON THE OTHER HAND DETESTED TOBACCO AND EXPRESSED HIMSELF ON THE SUBJECT WITH CHARACTERISTIC EXTRAVAGANCE AND VEHEMENCE--"JAMES I WAS A KNAVE A TYRANT A FOOL A LIAR A COWARD
IN THE EXTRAORDINARY RECORD OF INANITY WHICH ADDISON PRINTED AS THE DIARY OF A CITIZEN IN THE SPECTATOR OF MARCH 4 1712 THE DEVOTION OF THE WORTHY RETIRED TRADESMAN TO TOBACCO IS EMPHASIZED
NO FELLOW CAN FALL IN LOVE WHEN HE HAS CONTINUALLY A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
I HAVE HEARD SOME OF OUR OLD YEOMEN NEIGHBOURS SAY THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO MALMESBURY OR CHIPPENHAM MARKET THEY CULLED OUT THEIR BIGGEST SHILLINGS TO LAY IN THE SCALES AGAINST THE TOBACCO II TOBACCO TRIUMPHANT
WHEN I MATRICULATED AT OXFORD AT THE EASTER OF 1858
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE REDUCTION OF THE DUTY ON CIGARS FROM 18S
IN THE BOOK OF SNOBS MAJOR WELLESLEY PONTO GOES TO SMOKE A CIGAR IN THE STABLES--PONTO HAD NO SMOKING-ROOM--WITH LORD GULES WHO IS DESCRIBED AS A VERY YOUNG SHORT SANDY-HAIRED AND TOBACCO-SMOKING NOBLEMAN WHO CANNOT HAVE LEFT THE NURSERY VERY LONG LATER PONTO AND GULES RESUME SMOKING OPERATIONS
IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I QUOTED FROM ADDISON'S DIARY OF A RETIRED TRADESMAN IN THE SPECTATOR OF 1712
I LAUGH AT THE DOMINION OF CUSTOM IN THIS AND MANY THINGS
EACH FOR SMOKING TOBACCO AROUND THE END OF THE MEETING-HOUSE
HYNDMAN IN HIS RECORD OF AN ADVENTUROUS LIFE SAYS THAT WHEN HE WAS LIVING AS A PUPIL ABOUT THE YEAR 1860 WITH THE RECTOR OF OXBURGH HIS FELLOW-PUPILS INCLUDED EDWARD ABBOTT OF SALONICA WHO POOR FELLOW WAS BATTERED TO PIECES BY THE TURKS WITH IRON STAVES TORN FROM PALINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TURCO-SERVIAN WAR
THE PERIODICAL PUBLICATIONS OF A GENERATION OR SO LATER PAID THE GREAT ESSAYIST THE FLATTERY OF IMITATION IN THIS RESPECT AS IN OTHERS
PRIDE STANDING SENTINELL AT THE DOOR DENYED ENTRANCE AND CAUSED THEM TO RETREAT INTO THE LOBBY WHERE THEY USED TO DRINK ALE AND TOBACCO THERE IS A CURIOUS ENTRY IN THOMAS BURTON'S DIARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF CROMWELL'S PARLIAMENT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY THEN HAVE BEEN THE LUXURY OF A MEMBERS SMOKING-ROOM
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST EVEN AN APPROXIMATE DATE
IT YIELDS A BITTER OIL AND IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS FEBRIFUGAL PROPERTIES
THE SAME REGISTER OF 1630 RECORDS THE PRESENTMENT OF TWO MEN OF THE SAME FAMILY NAME--THOMAS BOURINGE AND PHILIP BOURINGE--"FOR KEEPING OPEN THEIR SHOPS AND SELLING TOBACCO AT UNLAWFUL HOURS AND HAVING DISORDERLY PEOPLE IN THEIR HOUSE TO THE GREAT DISTURBANCE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS AND NEIGHBOURS NEAR ADJOINING THE RAM ALLEY FLEET STREET MENTIONED ABOVE WAS NOTORIOUS IN SUNDRY WAYS
IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A FAIR INFERENCE FROM THE WORDING OF THIS PROHIBITION THAT WHEN THE KING WAS NOT AT CAMBRIDGE GRADUATES AND SCHOLARS AND STUDENTS COULD RESUME THEIR LIBERTY TO RESORT TO INNS TAVERNS ALE-HOUSES AND TOBACCO-SHOPS AND PRESUMABLY TO TAKE TOBACCO IN ST MARY'S CHURCH WITHOUT QUESTION
HE PROBABLY FOUND SOME RELIEF IN TOBACCO FROM THE SEVERE INTERNAL PAINS WITH WHICH FOR MANY YEARS HE WAS AFFLICTED
IF THE ESSAYIST DISCONTINUED OR MODIFIED HIS SMOKING HABITS HE MADE UP FOR IT BY DEVOTION TO SNUFF--A DEVOTION WHICH HIS SISTER SHARED
AND A FAMILIAR ANECDOTE REPRESENTS HIM AS USING FOR THE PURPOSES OF A TOBACCO-STOPPER IN A FIT OF ABSENT-MINDEDNESS THE LITTLE FINGER OF A LADY SITTING BESIDE HIM WHOM HE ADMIRED BUT THE TRUTH OF THIS LEGEND IS OPEN TO DOUBT
IN THE WELL-KNOWN DESCRIPTION OF THE FAMOUS COUNTRY SQUIRE MR HASTINGS WHO WAS REMARKABLE FOR KEEPING UP OLD CUSTOMS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WE READ OF HOW HIS HALL TABLES WERE LITTERED WITH HAWKS HOODS BELLS OLD HATS WITH THEIR CROWNS THRUST IN FULL OF PHEASANTS EGGS
BROWNING ALSO SMOKED BUT NOT I THINK A PIPE
AMONG OTHER WELL-KNOWN MEN OF STANDING AND FASHION WHO WERE SMOKERS ABOUT THIS PERIOD MAY BE NAMED LORD ELDON LORD STOWELL BROUGHAM LORD CALTHORP AND H.R.H
WHEN TENNYSON WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE AT CAMBRIDGE 1828-30 HE AND HIS COMPANIONS ALL SMOKED
NOTHING I WARRANT YOU
IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO EVADE SO ABSURD A REGULATION AS THIS
A PAST OVERSEER WHO DETAINED THE BOX IN 1793 HAD TO GIVE IT BACK AFTER THREE YEARS OF LITIGATION
14
A HEAD AND FOR THIS MODEST SUM THE THIRTY CONVIVES ENJOYED ELEVEN GALLONS OF RED OPORTO ONE OF WHITE LISBON AND THREE OF MOUNTAIN TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF TWO POUNDS OF TOBACCO AT 3S
FOUR MEN WERE PRESENTED FOR SELLING ALE AND TOBACCO UNLICENSED AND FOR ANNOYING THE JUDGES OF SERJEANTS INN WHOSE CHAMBERS ARE NEAR ADJOYNING TWO OTHER MEN ONE OF THEM HAILING FROM THE NOTORIOUS RAM ALLEY WERE PRESENTED FOR ANNOYING THE JUDGES AT SERJEANTS INN WITH THE STENCH AND SMELL OF THEIR TOBACCO WHICH LOOKS AS IF THE JUDGES WERE OF KING JAMES'S MIND ABOUT SMOKING
TOBACKA-PIPES FROM THE VARIOUS ENTRIES IN THE DIARY RELATING TO THE PURCHASE OF TOBACCO IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NO SHOP IN EXETER DEVOTED SPECIALLY OR EXCLUSIVELY TO THE SALE OF THE WEED
THEY USE TO TAKE THE FUME OR SMOKE THEREOF BY SUCKING IT THROUGH PIPES MADE OF CLAIE INTO THEIR STOMACKE AND HEADE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THEN AS SINCE THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY WERE LITTLE REGARDED BY MANY ARTISTS AND MEN OF LETTERS
MR STEINMETZ IN HIS BOOK ON TOBACCO PUBLISHED IN 1857 REMARKED THAT NO WAY OF USING TOBACCO HAD MADE A MORE STRIKING ADVANCE IN ENGLAND WITHIN THE PRECEDING TWENTY YEARS THAN CIGARS
PUBLIC OR AT LEAST FASHIONABLE TASTE HAD BEGUN TO CHANGE AND NASH CORRECTLY INTERPRETED AND LED IT
AND HERE THEY SAT HE SAYS TAKING THEIR PUNCH AND SMOKING THE PREVAILING CUSTOM OF THE TIME ABOUT THE SAME TIME CIRCA 1790 AN EVENING RESORT FOR PURPOSES MOSTLY VICIOUS WAS THE FAMOUS DOG AND DUCK IN ST GEORGE'S FIELDS
IN HIS PENCILLINGS BY THE WAY WRITING IN JULY 1833 WILLIS DESCRIBES THE PREVALENCE OF SMOKING IN VIENNA AMONG ALL THE NATIONALITIES THAT THRONGED THAT COSMOPOLITAN CAPITAL
TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SIGNS MAY BE DETECTED OF SOME WANING IN THE UNIVERSAL POPULARITY OF TOBACCO
IT MAY FAIRLY BE CONCLUDED I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH ABOUT 1860 THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN OCCASIONAL CIGARETTE-SMOKER IN ENGLAND LIKE THE EDWARD ABBOTT OF MR HYNDMAN'S REMINISCENCES YET IT WAS NOT UNTIL A LITTLE LATER DATE THAT THE SMALL PAPER-ENCLOSED ROLLS OF TOBACCO BECAME AT ALL COMMON AMONG ENGLISHMEN
SMOKING UNFASHIONABLE CONTINUED
THERE ARE MANY COLOURS IN THE RAINBOW
WHEN ROBERT EARL OF ESSEX AND HENRY EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON WERE TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON IN WESTMINSTER HALL ON FEBRUARY 19 1600-1 THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHO WITH THE JUDGES FORMED THE COURT IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR OF THE TIME BEHAVED IN A REMARKABLE AND UNSEEMLY MANNER
AND TO SMOKE THE NEWFANGLED CIGAR WAS WORSE
BUT HERE IT MAY BE NOTED THAT MOST OF THE OLD INTOLERANCE OF TOBACCO HAS DISAPPEARED
BY ONE WHO SMOKES IT I SHOULD LIKE SAID THE WRITER PIPE-MEN OF ALL DEGREES TO ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THE TIME HAS NOT REALLY ARRIVED TO ENTER A PROTEST AGAINST THE CONVENTION WHICH FORCES THE PIPE INTO A POSITION OF INFERIORITY AND EXALTS TO A PINNACLE OF UNDESERVED PRE-EMINENCE THE CIGAR AND STILL MORE THE CIGARETTE
PRIDEAUX ALSO REPLYING TO A QUERY OF MINE WROTE
HOGARTH WAS FOND OF INTRODUCING THE PIPE INTO HIS PLATES
HE CONTINUES WITH MORE BOMBAST IN PRAISE OF THE MEDICINAL VIRTUES OF THE HERB--VIRTUES WHICH WERE THEN VERY FIRMLY AND WIDELY BELIEVED IN--AND IS REPLIED TO BY COB THE ANTI-TOBACCONIST WHO WITH EQUAL EXAGGERATION ON THE OTHER SIDE DENOUNCES TOBACCO AND DECLARES THAT FOUR PEOPLE HAD DIED IN ONE HOUSE FROM THE USE OF IT IN THE PRECEDING WEEK AND THAT ONE HAD VOIDED A BUSHEL OF SOOT
NOT SO VERY LONG AGO IT WAS CONSIDERED UNSEEMLY TO SMOKE A PIPE AT ALL IN THE STREET UNLESS YOU BELONGED TO THE HUMBLER ORDERS WHO INHALE THEIR NICOTINE THROUGH THE STEM OF A CLAY AND EXPECTORATE WITH A GREATER SENSE OF FREEDOM THAN OF RESPONSIBILITY AT A FEW CLUBS THERE ARE STILL SOME CURIOUS AND RATHER UNMEANING RESTRICTIONS
UPON WHICH HAVING FILLED ONE FOR MY OWN USE I LIGHTED IT AT THE LITTLE WAX CANDLE THAT STOOD BEFORE THEM
THE STATEMENT NOT VERY GRAMMATICALLY EXPRESSED THAT THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING WAS ITSELF A SPECIES OF INTOXICATION WAS ABSURD ENOUGH
THE LONG ROOM SAYS ANGELO IF I MAY DEPEND ON MY MEMORY WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND ALL THE BENCHES WERE FILLED WITH MOTLEY GROUPS EATING DRINKING AND SMOKING ANGELO ALSO MENTIONS THE PICNIC SOCIETY A CELEBRATED RESORT OF FASHION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHERE THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO NEVER PENETRATED
6D.--WHICH WAS CHEAPER STILL
THE EARLIEST REFERENCE TO SUCH A PRACTICE OCCURS IN 1590 WHEN POPE INNOCENT XII EXCOMMUNICATED ALL SUCH PERSONS AS WERE FOUND TAKING SNUFF OR USING TOBACCO IN ANY FORM IN THE CHURCH OF ST PETER AT ROME
WILLIAM CROWE WHO WAS PUBLIC ORATOR FROM 1784 TO 1829--ARE BOTH SAID TO HAVE BEEN LIKE PRIOR RATHER FOND OF FREQUENTING THE COMPANY OF PERSONS OF HUMBLE RANK AND LITTLE EDUCATION WITH WHOM THEY WOULD DRINK THEIR ALE AND SMOKE THEIR PIPES
AND BURNAND'S BURLESQUE INCLUDED A DUET WITH THE REFRAIN
IN ENGLAND IT WOULD SEEM AS IF SOME OF THE EARLY SMOKERS IN THE FULNESS OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE NEW INDULGENCE WENT SO FAR AS TO SMOKE IN CHURCH
THE MENFOLK--WILSON ADAMS AND JOSEPH--HAVE TO SPEND THE NIGHT SEATED ROUND THE FIRE BUT APPARENTLY ADAMS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEKS THE SOLACE OF TOBACCO
THERE WERE OCCASIONAL SURVIVALS WHICH ARE TO BE FOUND TO THIS DAY SUCH AS THE BARBER'S POLE ACCOMPANIED SOMETIMES BY THE BRASS BASIN OF THE BARBER-SURGEON THE GLORIFIED CANISTER OF A GROCER OR THE GOLDEN LEG OF A HOSIER
THESE ENTRIES AND MANY OTHERS OF SIMILAR IMPORT SHOW THAT AT FEASTS AND AT SOCIAL AND CONVIVIAL GATHERINGS OF ALL KINDS TOBACCO MAINTAINED ITS ASCENDANCY
IT SEEMS TO HAVE GROWN OUT OF HEARNE'S RECORD OF THE PRACTICE AT ETON

UNIVERSITY MEN USED TO BE RATHER PARTICULAR ABOUT THE PIPES THEY SMOKED
MANY TRYED CONTINUES HEARNE AND TWAS THOUGHT THAT A JOURNEYMAN TAYLOUR OF ST PETER'S IN THE EAST WOULD HAVE BEEN VICTOR HE SMOKING FASTER THAN AND BEING MANY PIPES BEFORE THE REST
HE SELDOM WORE A COAT BUT GENERALLY APPEARED IN A PLAID GOWN AND WAS ALWAYS SEEN WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH JOHN ELIOT THE NOBLE PREACHER AND MISSIONARY TO THE INDIANS WARMLY DENOUNCED BOTH THE WEARING OF WIGS AND THE SMOKING OF TOBACCO

THE LATE BISHOP MANDELL CREIGHTON OF LONDON WAS AN INCESSANT SMOKER OF CIGARETTES
BUT HIS REPUTATION WAS THEN GREAT AND HE TRADED UPON IT
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A REPRESENTATION OF THE TOBACCO PLANT ITSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE NATURAL AND COMPREHENSIVE SIGN THAN ONE PARTICULAR PREPARATION OF THE HERB YET REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PLANT WERE RARE WHILE THOSE OF THE COMPRESSED TOBACCO KNOWN AS PUDDING OR ROLL IN THE FORM OF A TOBACCO ROLL AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE VERY FREQUENTLY USED AS SIGNS

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS QUITE INTELLIGIBLE
PIPES WERE AND ARE STILL LOOKED AT ASKANCE IN MANY PLACES WHERE THE SMOKING OF CIGARS AND CIGARETTES IS FREELY ALLOWED AND FASHION FROWNED ON THE PIPE IN STREET OR PARK
AND THEY BLEW THE SMOAK OF TOBACCO A THING WHICH THEY KNEW HIS MAJESTY HATED IN HIS SACRED MOUTH THROWING THEIR BROKEN PIPES IN HIS WAY AS HE PASSED ALONG TIME BROUGHT ITS REVENGES

UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SMOKING WAS VERY COMMON AMONG THE HARD-WORKING WOMEN OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND THE SCOTTISH BORDER
MANY PIPES DISPLAY ON THE HEELS VARIOUS FORMS OF LINES HATCHED AND MILLED WHICH WERE PERHAPS THE EARLIEST MARKS OF IDENTIFICATION ADOPTED BY THE PIPE-MAKERS

PARR WAS NOT A MODEL SMOKER
BUT AS KING CHARLES HATED THE WEED COURTIERS MAY HAVE FROWNED UPON ITS USE
GONZALES IN HIS VOYAGE TO GREAT BRITAIN 1731 SAYS THAT THE USE OF TOBACCO WAS VERY UNIVERSAL AND INDEED NOT IMPROPER FOR SO MOIST A CLIMATE HE TELLS US THAT THOUGH THE TAVERNS WERE VERY NUMEROUS YET THE ALE-HOUSES WERE MUCH MORE SO

BEN JONSON THE ALCHEMIST THE DRUGGISTS AND OTHER TRADESMEN WHO SOLD TOBACCO IN ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DAYS HAD EVERY PROVISION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THEIR NUMEROUS CUSTOMERS
AND ON THAT OF THE TILL THE FOLLOWING DOGGEREL LINES
EARLY GEORGIAN DAYS 99 VIII
IF SOME WITNESSES MAY BE BELIEVED SMOKING HAD ALMOST DIED OUT EVEN AT OXFORD
THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
PERHAPS THE MOST ABSURD AND UNMEANING OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT REMAIN IS THAT WHICH AT CERTAIN TIMES AND IN CERTAIN PLACES ADMITS THE SMOKING OF CIGARS AND CIGARETTES AND FORBIDS THE SMOKING OF PIPES
OF WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT THE VERY HIGH PRICE OF 15S
BUT THE NUMBERS OF THESE MISGUIDED FOLK BECOME FEWER EVERY YEAR
I PRAY THEE MINE HOST GIVE US A POT AND A TOST AND LET US DRINKE ALL TOGETHER THE SCENE IS A TAVERN INTERIOR
WILLIAM PENN THE FOUNDER OF PENNSYLVANIA PURCHASED A TRACT OF LAND AND 300 PIPES WERE INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLES GIVEN IN THE EXCHANGE THE FRENCH TRAVELLER SORBIERE WHO VISITED LONDON IN 1663 DECLARED THAT THE ENGLISH WERE NATURALLY LAZY AND SPENT HALF THEIR TIME IN TAKING TOBACCO
IMAGES OF THIS KIND SOMETIMES STOOD AT THE DOOR OR IN MANY CASES WERE PLACED ON BRACKETS OR SWUNG FROM THE LINTELS
A LITTLE LATER IN THE BOOK THE READER FINDS HIM WHEN ENCAMPED IN THE BACK PARLOUR OF THE OLD MAN'S SHOP SMOKING PIPE AFTER PIPE AND COMPELLING THAT KNAVISH ATTORNEY SAMPSON BRASS TO DO THE SAME

AND THIS PERFORMANCE WAS TERMED KEEPING OR HOLDING AN ACT
BUT COMING DOWN ONE MORNING TO THE PARLOUR I FOUND AS THE ROOM WAS SMALL AND CONFINED THAT THE SMELL WAS UNPLEASANT AND LAID ASIDE THE USE OF THE NICOTIAN WEED FOR MANY YEARS
THE FIRST THING I SAID ON ENTERING THE PUBLIC ROOM WAS--'WHAT A DELIGHTFUL THING THE SMELL OF TOBACCO IS IN A WARM ROOM ON A WET NIGHT
AFTER SPENDING AN EVENING WITH OXFORD BOLINGBROKE POPE AND SWIFT IT IS RECORDED THAT HE WOULD GO AND SMOKE A PIPE AND DRINK A BOTTLE OF ALE WITH A COMMON SOLDIER AND HIS WIFE IN LONG ACRE BEFORE HE WENT TO BED SOME OF PRIOR'S POEMS AS THACKERAY CAUSTICALLY REMARKS SMACK NOT A LITTLE OF THE CONVERSATION OF HIS LONG ACRE FRIENDS
TARLTON AS OTHER GENTLEMEN USED AT THE FIRST COMMING UP OF TOBACCO DID TAKE IT MORE FOR FASHION'S SAKE THAN OTHERWISE AND BEING IN A ROOME SET BETWEEN TWO MEN OVERCOME WITH WINE AND THEY NEVER SEEING THE LIKE WONDERED AT IT AND SEEING THE VAPOUR COME OUT OF TARLTON'S NOSE CRYED OUT FIRE FIRE AND THREW A CUP OF WINE IN TARLTON'S FACE
AND FOR A NEEDE TO RIDE PRETTIE AND WELL A CURIOUS FEATURE OF TOBACCO-MANNERS AMONG FASHIONABLE SMOKERS OF THE PERIOD WAS THE PRACTICE OF PASSING A PIPE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AFTER THE FASHION OF THE LOVING CUP THERE IS A SCENE IN GREENE'S TU QUOQUE 1614 LAID IN A FASHIONABLE ORDINARY WHERE THE LONDON GALLANTS MEET AS USUAL AND ONE SAYS TO A COMPANION WHO IS SMOKING
LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
SIR WALTER RALEIGH INTRODUCED TOBACCO INTO ENGLAND AND WHEN SMOKING IT IN THIS COUNTRY SAID TO HIS SERVANT MASTER RIDLEY WE ARE TO-DAY LIGHTING A CANDLE IN ENGLAND WHICH BY GOD'S BLESSING WILL NEVER BE PUT OUT
IT IS OF THE ORDINARY SHAPE HE WROTE BUT DIFFERS FROM ANY I HAVE PREVIOUSLY SEEN IN THIS RESPECT THAT IT WORKS WITH A SIXPENCE AND NOT WITH A PENNY OR HALFPENNY
HE HAD A FANCY FOR TAKING TOBACCO IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE FASHIONABLE MODE OF TAKING SNUFF
5S
HE GOES ON IN BURLESQUE STRAIN TO SPEAK OF THE JOYS OF TOBACCO WHEN HE LIES IN IDLENESS BY THE STREAMS IN BREATHLESS SUMMER COMFORTED BY A BATH JUST TAKEN OR WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE IS WORN OUT BY REVISING ENDLESS EXERCISES UNDERLINING THE MISTAKES IN RED AND ALLOTTING MARKS OR WEIGHED DOWN BY THE WISE MEN OF OLD--THUCYDIDES SOPHOCLES EURIPIDES THE IDEAS OF PLATO WILES OF PINDAR FEARFULLY CORRUPT STROPHE OF CHORUS WONDROUS GUESSES OF TEUTONS AND FANCIES OF PHILOLOGISTS WHEN MEN SWOON IN THE INEXPLICABLE WANDERINGS OF THE ENDLESS EXAMINATION OF HOMER WHEN THE BRAIN REELS AMONG SUCH TOIL--THEN HE HAILS THE PIPE HELP OF MORTALS AND HASTENS TO KINDLE SACRIFICES AT ITS ALTARS AND REJOICES AS HE TASTES ITS SMOKE
I CAN REMEMBER VAGUELY ON ONE OCCASION THROUGH A CLOUD OF SMOKE LOOKING ACROSS A DARKENING ROOM AT THE NOBLE GRAVE HEAD OF THE POET LAUREATE
ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM COMPARATIVELY EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THERE WERE TO BE FOUND HERE AND THERE WOMEN WHO SMOKED
BUT WHY THE VERY WOMEN
BEN JONSON HAS GIVEN US AN AMUSING PICTURE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF GALLANTS ON THE ELIZABETHAN STAGE IN HIS CYNTHIA'S REVELS IN THIS SCENE A CHILD THUS MIMICS THE OBTRUSIVE BEAU
MOREOVER THE SUPPER BEING FINISHED THEY SET ON THE TABLE HALF A DOZEN PIPES AND A PACKET OF TOBACCO FOR SMOKING WHICH IS A GENERAL CUSTOM AS WELL AMONG WOMEN AS MEN WHO THINK THAT WITHOUT TOBACCO ONE CANNOT LIVE IN ENGLAND BECAUSE SAY THEY IT DISSIPATES THE EVIL HUMOURS OF THE BRAIN ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO M
POPE FOR AWHILE ATTENDED THE SYMPOSIUM AT BUTTON'S COFFEE-HOUSE WHERE ADDISON WAS THE CENTRE OF THE COTERIE--HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS SITTING WITH THEM TILL TWO IN THE MORNING OVER PUNCH AND BURGUNDY AMID THE FUMES OF TOBACCO--BUT SUCH A WAY OF LIFE DID NOT SUIT HIS SICKLY CONSTITUTION AND HE SOON WITHDREW
IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL DUTY OF 2D
IT IS ENGRAVED WITH THE USUAL LINES EXCEPT THAT THE USER IS ASKED TO PUT SIXPENCE IN THE TILL AND THEN TO SHUT DOWN THE LID UNDER PENALTY OF A FINE OF A SHILLING
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN OUR EASTERN COUNTIES SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME CURIOUS IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHERE TOBACCO SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE SMOKED
AS CONCERNING THE SMOKE HE SAYS IT MAY BE TAKEN MORE FREQUENTLY AND FOR THE SAID EFFECTS BUT ALWAYS FASTING AND WITH EMPTIE STOMACK NOT AS THE ENGLISH ABUSERS DO WHICH MAKE A SMOKE-BOXE OF THEIR SKULL MORE FIT TO BE CARRIED UNDER HIS ARME THAT SELLETH AT PARIS DUNOIR A NOIRCIR TO BLACKE MENS SHOOES THEN TO CARIE THE BRAINE OF HIM THAT CAN NOT WALKE CAN NOT RYDE EXCEPT THE TABACCO PYPE BE IN HIS MOUTH HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS ONCE IN COMPANY WITH AN ENGLISH MERCHANT IN NORMANDY--"BETWEENE ROWEN AND NEW-HAVEN"--WHO WAS A MERRY FELLOW BUT WAS CONSTANTLY WANTING A COAL TO KINDLE HIS TOBACCO
THE ORIGINAL SMOKING-ROOM OF THE ATHENAEUM CLUB WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN 1824 THE PRESENT BUILDING BEING ERECTED IN 1830 WAS A MISERABLE LITTLE ROOM DR HAWTREE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCING THAT NO GENTLEMAN SMOKED THE ORIENTAL CLUB WHEN BUILT IN 1826-27 CONTAINED NO SMOKING-ROOM AT ALL
WHEN YOU HAVE FILLED WITHOUT DELAY CLOSE THE LID OR SIXPENCE PAY ONE OF THESE OLD BRASS PENNY-IN-THE-SLOT TOBACCO-BOXES WAS INCLUDED IN THE EXHIBITION OF WELSH ANTIQUITIES HELD AT CARDIFF IN THE SUMMER OF 1913
SAM WELLER'S FATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE PHILOSOPHICALLY
A WRITER NAMED DEACON PUBLISHED IN 1616 A QUARTO ENTITLED TOBACCO TORTURED IN THE FILTHY FUMES OF TOBACCO REFINED
AND SOMETIMES SHEE HATH HAD A JOINT OF MEAT AND A COPLE OF CHICKENS DRESSED THERE
IN THE BELFAST MUSEUM THERE IS A CAST IRON TOBACCO-PIPE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG
THEN HE GOES ON TO BRAG OF ITS QUALITY--YOUR RIGHT TRINIDADO--AND TO ASSERT THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE INDIES WHERE THE HERB GROWS AND WHERE HE HIMSELF AND A DOZEN OTHER GENTLEMEN HAD FOR THE SPACE OF ONE-AND-TWENTY WEEKS KNOWN NO OTHER NUTRIMENT THAN THE FUME OF TOBACCO
HAPPY THRICE AND THRICE AGEN HAPPIEST HE OF HAPPY MEN IMITATIONS THREE AND FIVE PRAISE THE LEAF IN LESS HAPPY STRAINS THOUGH NUMBER FIVE HAS A LINE WORTH NOTING FOR OUR PURPOSE IN WHICH TOBACCO IS SPOKEN OF AS BY LADIES HATED HATED BY THE BEAUX THE SIXTH SINKS TO RIBALDRY
THERE ARE ALSO ONE OR TWO REFERENCES IN THE EARLY DRAMATISTS
SUBLIME TOBOCCO
WHEN THAT WAS OVER THE YOUNGER OF OUR ENTERTAINERS BROUGHT OUT A CIGAR-BOX AND GAVE ME A CIGAR MADE OF NEGROHEAD SHE SAID WHICH WOULD QUELL AN ELEPHANT IN SIX WHIFFS
THE BEAUX WITH THEIR FULL WIGS--THEY CARRIED COMBS OF IVORY OR TORTOISESHELL IN THEIR POCKETS WITH WHICH THEY PUBLICLY COMBED THEIR FLOWING LOCKS--THEIR DANDY CANES AND SCENTED LACED HANDKERCHIEFS WERE NOT THE MEN TO ENJOY THE FLAVOUR OF TOBACCO IN A PIPE
BEST VIRGINNEA IN A LETTER TO HIS DAUGHTER ELIZABETH DATED 21 JANUARY 1705 THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THIS SAME DEALER WHOM HE DESCRIBES AS ADAM BODDEN BACCONIST IN GEORGE YARD LUMBER LOMBARD STREET THE ALLUSION IS WORTH NOTING AS A VERY EARLY INSTANCE OF THE COLLOQUIAL TRICK OF ABBREVIATION FAMILIAR IN LATER DAYS IN SUCH FORMS AS BACCY AND BACCA AND THEIR COMPOUNDS
THE PAPER OF TOBACCO WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT IS NOW VULGARLY CALLED A SCREW OF TOBACCO
IN 1733 A SATIRE WAS PUBLISHED VIOLENTLY ATTACKING THE FELLOWS OF VARIOUS COLLEGES
MRS SKINNER OF THE OLD-ESTABLISHED TOBACCONIST'S OPPOSITE THE LAW COURTS IN THE STRAND POSSESSED ABOUT THE YEAR 1890 TWO SIGNS OF THE BLACK BOY APPERTAINING NO DOUBT TO THE OLD HOUSE OF MESSRS
THE WOMAN IS PLAINLY A CONVIVIAL SOUL
THE CIGAR DEALT THE SNUFF-BOX ITS DEATH-BLOW AND THE CIGARETTE WAS CHIEF MOURNER AT ITS FUNERAL
AND FOR DISCOURSE IN MY FAIR MISTRESS'S PRESENCE I DID NOT AS YOU BARREN GALLANTS DO FILL MY DISCOURSES UP DRINKING TOBACCO AND IN BEN JONSON'S EVERY MAN OUT OF HIS HUMOUR 1600 FASTIDIOUS BRISK A NEAT SPRUCE AFFECTING COURTIER SMOKES WHILE HE TALKS TO HIS MISTRESS
ANOTHER IN THE SAME COLLECTION WITH A SIMILAR MEANING BUT OF MORE ELABORATE DESIGN SHOWS THE THREE MEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE HAVING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND IN HIS MOUTH A PIPE FROM WHICH SMOKE IS ROLLING
KNOCKDUNDER'S PIPE ACCORDING TO SCOTT WAS MADE OF IRON
IT WAS FROM HIM THAT DR SUMNER LEARNED TO SMOKE
THE ONLY CONCLUSION THE OBSERVER CAN COME TO IS THAT THE FASHIONABLE ATTITUDE TOWARDS PIPES IS ONE OF THE LAST RELICS OF THE OLD SOCIAL ATTITUDE--THE ATTITUDE OF GEORGIAN AND EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS--TOWARDS SMOKING OF ANY KIND
BRING ME MY BILL THE LEARNED DOCTOR EXAGGERATED NO DOUBT AS REGARDS THE FACILITIES GIVEN HIM FOR SMOKING
THE BILL WAS DEFEATED IN 1733 AND GREAT AND GENERAL WERE THE REJOICINGS
AN EXAMPLE IN THE SHIRBURN BALLADS LIES BEFORE ME
NA NA LADDIE I'VE COME IN HERE FOR A SMOKE MA'SEL THE DARLINGTON AND STOCKTON TIMES IN 1856 RECORDED THE DEATH ON DECEMBER 10 AT WALLBURY IN THE NORTH RIDING OF YORKSHIRE IN THE 110TH YEAR OF HER AGE OF JANE GARBUTT WIDOW
DUNTON IN THAT ATHENIAN ORACLE WHICH WAS A KIND OF EARLY FORERUNNER OF NOTES AND QUERIES ALLUDED TO PIPE-SMOKING BY THE GOOD WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE WEST MISSON THE FRENCH TRAVELLER WHO WAS HERE IN 1698 AFTER REMARKING THAT TABACCO IS VERY MUCH USED IN ENGLAND SAYS THAT THE VERY WOMEN TAKE IT IN ABUNDANCE PARTICULARLY IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES
THERE IS AN HERBE WHICH IS SOWED A PART BY ITSELFE AND IS CALLED BY THE INHABITANTS VPPOWOC
MOTHER IMMEDIATELY LIGHTED HER CIGAR
THIS PIPE IS ALMOST COLOURED
IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT HE SMOKED
IN TABACCO THERE IS NOTHING WHICH IS NOT MEDICINE THE ROOT THE STALKE THE LEAVES THE SEEDS THE SMOAKE THE ASHES THE DOCTOR GIVES SUNDRY DIRECTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING TOBACCO--"TO BE USED IN INFUSION IN DECOCTION IN SUBSTANCE IN SMOKE IN SALT BUT BARCLAY CLEARLY DOES NOT SYMPATHIZE WITH ITS INDISCRIMINATE USE FOR PLEASURE
G.L.A
ONE DAY ABOUT THE YEAR 1860 THE FUTURE ARCHBISHOP WAS WALKING WITH THE RECTOR OF EVERSLEY IN A REMOTE PART OF THE PARISH ON A COMMON WHEN KINGSLEY SUDDENLY SAID--"I MUST SMOKE A PIPE AND FORTHWITH WENT TO A FURZE-BUSH AND FELT ABOUT IN IT FOR A TIME
I AM GOING TO LEAVE OFF TOBACCO AND THEN WE MUST THRIVE
THAT IT IS A MOST EXCELLENT PRESERVATIVE BOTH EXPERIENCE AND REASON DO TEACH
THE ACTION OF THE FIRST CHAPTERS OF THACKERAY'S PENDENNIS PASSES EARLY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
IT WAS YEARS AFTER THIS THAT HE MET MACREADY AT TALFOURD'S AND BY WAY PROBABLY OF SAYING SOMETHING TO SHOCK MACREADY
IN SANDWICH AND IN BOSTON THE FINE FOR DRINKING TOBACCO IN THE MEETING-HOUSE WAS 5S
AT QUEENS THE COMBINATION-ROOM IN TENNYSON'S TIME HAD STILL A SANDED FLOOR AND THE TABLE WAS SET HANDSOMELY FORTH WITH LONG CHURCHWARDENS'"--AS THE POET TOLD PALGRAVE WHEN THE TWO VISITED CAMBRIDGE IN 1859
I COULD LAY IT ASIDE TO-MORROW
THROUGH JAMES'S REIGN MUCH DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED ABOUT THE IMPORTATION OF SPANISH TOBACCO AND THE OUTCOME OF THIS MAY PROBABLY BE SEEN IN THE PROCLAMATIONS ISSUED BY THE KING IN HIS LAST TWO YEARS FORBIDDING THE IMPORTATION BUYING OR SELLING TOBACCO WHICH WAS NOT OF THE PROPER GROWTH OF THE COLONIES OF VIRGINIA AND THE SOMERS ISLANDS THESE PROCLAMATIONS WERE SEVERAL TIMES CONFIRMED BY CHARLES I THE LATEST BEING ON JANUARY 8 1631
MOST MEN UNBEND OVER A PIPE EVEN IF THE BOOK IS AN ACCOMPANIMENT
AND CIGARETTES HAD BEEN USED BY MEN FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE IT BEGAN TO BE WHISPERED THAT HERE AND THERE A LADY--WHO WAS USUALLY CONSIDERED DREADFULLY FAST FOR HER PAINS--WAS ACCUSTOMED TO VENTURE UPON A CIGARETTE
IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM JOHN WATTS AN ALDERMAN OF LONDON WROTE
AND SO MAY SMOKE-INHALING BULL BE ALWAYS FILLING NEVER FULL THE ALLUSION IN THESE VERSES TO A SATIRIC WIPE REFERS TO A PASSAGE IN THE POEM ENTITLED CONVERSATION WHICH COWPER HAD WRITTEN IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR 1781
TOBACCO IS ONCE MORE TRIUMPHANT
BUT ON ANOTHER OCCASION IN THE SAME YEAR EACH OF THESE MEN WHO PRESUMABLY WERE ALE-HOUSE KEEPERS HAD TO PAY 30S.--A SUBSTANTIAL SUM CONSIDERING THE THEN VALUE OF MONEY--FOR THE SAME OFFENCE AND FOR SUFFERING PARISHIONERS TO SMOKE IN HIS HOUSE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHY A PUBLICAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN FINED AN ADDITIONAL 10S
IT WAS PROBABLY SOME INCONVENIENT APARTMENT OF NO ACCOUNT
A CURIOUS AND POPULAR VARIETY OF TOBACCO-BOX OFTEN TO BE FOUND IN RURAL INNS AND ALE-HOUSES WAS MADE SOMEWHAT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NOW EVERYWHERE FAMILIAR AUTOMATIC MACHINES
IT IS UNCERTAIN WHEN LICENCES WERE FIRST ISSUED FOR THE SALE OF TOBACCO
IL NE SE SOUTIENT QU'A FORCE DE CAFE THOUGH HE WOULD SIT WORKING AT HIS DESK FOR TWENTY-FIVE HOURS RUNNING
OTHER UNCOMMON FEATURES ARE THAT THE MONEY PORTION IS SHALLOW AND THAT THE PART FOR THE TOBACCO EXTENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BOX
WHEN THE NEWS REACHED DERBY ON APRIL 19 IN THAT YEAR THE DEALERS IN TOBACCO CAUSED ALL THE BELLS IN THE DERBY CHURCHES TO BE RUNG AND WE MAY BE SURE THAT THIS RATHER UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE WAS HIGHLY POPULAR
THE FASHIONABLE DISLIKE OF TOBACCO-SMOKE APPEARS IN THE PAGES OF ANOTHER DESCRIPTIVE WRITER--THE ONCE WELL KNOWN N.P
IT SHOWS THE COAL-HEAVERS SITTING ROUND THE FIRE SHOUTING OUT SOME STURDY CHORUS AND SMOKING LONG CLAYS
WHEN MR PICKWICK IS TAKEN TO THE HOUSE OF NAMBY THE SHERIFFS OFFICER THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE FRONT PARLOUR ARE FRESH SAND AND STALE TOBACCO SMOKE ONE OF THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM IS A MERE BOY OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY WHO THOUGH IT WAS YET BARELY TEN O'CLOCK WAS DRINKING GIN AND WATER AND SMOKING A CIGAR AMUSEMENTS TO WHICH JUDGING FROM HIS INFLAMED COUNTENANCE HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF PRETTY CONSTANTLY FOR THE LAST YEAR OR TWO OF HIS LIFE TOBACCO-SMOKE PERVADES THE FLEET PRISON
BUT TOBACCO WHIFFES MADE THEM LEAVE HIM TO PAY ALL IN THE EARLY DAYS OF SMOKING THE SMOKER WAS VERY GENERALLY SAID TO DRINK TOBACCO
RODE FOR A STOMACH AND INSPECTED AT ANNUAL BOTTLINGS CORKS SELECTED
AND WHY SHOULD THEY WONDER AT IT
THE ST ALPHEGE ACCOUNTS FOR 1739 HAVE THE ENTRY--"ORDERED THAT THERE BE NO SMOAKING NOR DRINKING FOR THE FUTURE IN THE VESTRY ROOM DURING THE TIME BUSINESS IS DOING ON PAIN OF FORFEITING ONE SHILLING ASSENTION DAY EXCEPTED FROM THIS IT WOULD SEEM FAIR TO INFER 1 THAT THERE WAS NO OBJECTION TO THE LIGHTING OF PIPES IN THE VESTRY AFTER THE BUSINESS OF THE MEETING HAD BEEN TRANSACTED
DURING THE EXPERIENCE OF A LONG LIFE HOWEVER CONTINUED GRONOW I NEVER KNEW BUT ONE PERSON OF WHOM IT WAS SAID THAT SMOKING WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH
WE LEARN FROM THE INVALUABLE GUNNING THAT AT CAMBRIDGE ABOUT 1786 SMOKING WAS GOING OUT OF FASHION AMONG THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMBINATION-ROOMS EXCEPT ON THE RIVER IN THE EVENING WHEN EVERY MAN PUT A SHORT PIPE IN HIS MOUTH I TOOK GREAT PAINS HE ADDS TO MAKE MYSELF MASTER OF THIS ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT I NEVER SUCCEEDED THOUGH I USED TO RENEW THE ATTEMPT WITH A PERSEVERANCE WORTHY OF A BETTER CAUSE ABOUT THE SAME TIME DR FARMER WAS MASTER OF EMMANUEL AND THE MASTER WAS AN INVETERATE SMOKER
OTHER MEN OF LETTERS OF THE TIME WERE ZEALOUS ADHERENTS OF THE PIPE
DEAN HOLE
HENRY S
FROM FOUR TO SIX
BUT THERE IS NO PIPE FOR HER AND SUCH PROVISION WAS NO DOUBT UNUSUAL
IT WAS ON A COGNATE OCCASION IN JESUS COLLEGE IN WHICH COBBLERS WAX PLAYED A PROMINENT PART THAT DR CORRIE DISMISSED THE CULPRIT AFTER A SEVERE LECTURE WITH THESE ADMIRABLE WORDS
IN GOOD FAITH A PIPE OF EXCELLENT VAPOUR THE OWNER OF THE PIPE THEN EXPLAINS THAT IT IS THE BEST THE HOUSE YIELDS WHEREUPON THE OTHER IMMEDIATELY DEPRECIATES IT SAYING AFFECTEDLY
AND A BOX OF PIPES WAS AMONG THE MISCELLANEOUS STORES
ON THIS OCCASION AFTER THE LUNCHEON INTERVAL TWO MEMBERS ENTERED THE COMMITTEE ROOM SMOKING ONE A CIGARETTE THE OTHER A CIGAR
CIGARETTE-SMOKING NOW SO POPULAR WAS THEN ALMOST UNKNOWN AND ABBOTT WHO ALWAYS SMOKED THE FINEST TURKISH TOBACCO WHICH HE ROLLED UP INTO CIGARETTES FOR HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST DEVOTEE OF THIS HABIT I ENCOUNTERED FAIRHOLT IN HIS BOOK ON TOBACCO WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1859 MENTIONS CIGARETTES AS BEING SMOKED IN SPAIN AND SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA BUT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THEIR USE IN THIS COUNTRY
ITS LINES SAYS MISS JEKYLL FILL ONE WITH THE SATISFACTION CAUSED BY A THING THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE ART AND SKILL OF A TRUE ARTIST THESE HOMELY TONGS ARE FASHIONED WITH A FINE EYE FOR SYMMETRY AND INDEED FOR BEAUTY OF DESIGN AND PERFECT FITNESS FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE
THIS IS DATED ABOUT 1630
HALL WHO BECAME A HEAVY SMOKER IS SAID TO HAVE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT INTERVALS IN THE SERVICE
THERE ARE IT IS TRUE A FEW CONVENTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS LEFT
BUT I AM VEXED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE
AND THE JUSTICE IS AN OLD FRIEND MOREOVER TOBACCO IN ANY FORM WAS SUSPECT
O RARE BEN BRADLEY
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH PIPES WERE PRESENTED BY COLONISTS IN AMERICA TO THE INDIANS
THROUGHOUT JOSEPH ANDREWS THE PARSON SMOKES AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY
IF ONE CONTEMPORARY WRITER MAY BE BELIEVED SOME OF THESE EARLY SMOKERS ACQUIRED THE ART OF EMITTING THE SMOKE THROUGH THEIR EARS BUT A HEALTHY SCEPTICISM IS PERMISSIBLE HERE
MR MATTHEW LIVINGSTONE WHO HAS CALENDARED THIS DOCUMENT SAYS THAT THE KING THEREIN PROCEEDS IN ORDER TO PREVENT SUCH INJURIOUS RESULTS OF THE USE OF TOBACCO TO APPOINT SIR JAMES LESLIE AND THOMAS DALMAHOY TO ENJOY FOR SEVEN YEARS THE SOLE POWER OF APPOINTING LICENSED VENDORS OF THE COMMODITY
IT BEING CONSIDERED THAT THE TOO FREQUENT USE OF SMOKING TOBACCO IS INCONSISTENT WITH FRIENDS HOLY PROFESSION IT IS DESIRED THAT SUCH AS HAVE OCCASION TO MAKE USE THEREOF TAKE IT PRIVATELY NEITHER TOO PUBLICLY IN THEIR OWN HOUSES NOR BY THE HIGHWAYS STREETS OR IN ALEHOUSES OR ELSEWHERE TENDING TO THE ABETTING THE COMMON EXCESS ANOTHER LANCASHIRE MONTHLY MEETING PENKETH UNDER DATE 18TH 8TH MO
AFTER RUMMAGING THE LEATHERN PURSE WHICH HUNG IN FRONT OF HIS PETTICOAT HE PRODUCED A SHORT TOBACCO-PIPE MADE OF IRON AND OBSERVED ALMOST ALOUD I HAE FORGOTTEN MY SPLEUCHAN--LACHLAN GANG DOON TO THE CLACHAN AND BRING ME UP A PENNYWORTH OF TWIST SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO-POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
SOME OF THEM ARE MARKED 200 DOLLARS THE STREETS REEK WITH TOBACCO-SMOKE
THEY SMOKED AFTER MEALS HE OBSERVED AND CONVERSED FOR A LONG TIME
DEATHY REPLACED WITH DEATHLY | | PAGE 133
EVEN AT TABLE HE SAYS WHERE THEY SERVE DESSERTS THEY DO BUT SHOW THEM AND PRESENTLY TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING EVEN TO THE TABLECLOTH
HE HAS DESCENDED TO SING ITS PRAISES IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE BY 1762 AS WE SHALL SEE SMOKING WAS QUITE UNFASHIONABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS THAT A POET COULD DESCEND SO LOW AS TO SING THE PRAISES OF TOBACCO
HOGARTH IN THE EARLIER PERIOD OF HIS CAREER AS AN ENGRAVER ENGRAVED MANY SHOP-BILLS AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS USUALLY ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THOUGH THE ATTRIBUTION HAS BEEN DISPUTED
BUDDING WITS THOUGHT THEMSELVES HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED IF THEY COULD OBTAIN THE HONOUR OF BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE A PINCH FROM IT
WIGS SOON COVERED NEARLY EVERY CLERICAL HEAD FROM THE BENCH OF BISHOPS DOWNWARDS
AND HAWKINS HEARD HIM SAY ON ONE OCCASION THAT INSANITY HAD GROWN MORE FREQUENT SINCE SMOKING HAD GONE OUT OF FASHION WHICH SHOWS THAT EVEN JOHNSON COULD FALL A VICTIM TO THE POST HOC PROPTER HOC FALLACY
THE BOX WAS FULL OF CIGARETTES--GOOD LARGE ONES MADE OF PRETTY STRONG TOBACCO
FOR WHEN ONE TAKES IT EITHER BY CHEWING IT IN THE LEAF OR SMOAKING IT IN THE PIPE THE HUMORS ARE DRAWN AND BROUGHT FROM ALL PARTS OF THE BODY TO THE STOMACH AND FROM THENCE RISING UP TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOBACCONIST AS TO THE HELME OF A SUBLIMATORY ARE VOIDED AND SPITTEN OUT WHEN PLAGUE WAS ABROAD EVEN CHILDREN WERE COMPELLED TO SMOKE
WHILE AT YET ANOTHER TIME A FELLOW CAME INTO CHURCH WITH A POT OF BEER AND A PIPE AND REMAINED SMOKING IN HIS OWN PEW UNTIL THE END OF THE SERMON GOING TO CHURCH AT HAYES IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXCITING EXPERIENCE
A SPANISH LEXICOGRAPHER OF AUTHORITY SAYS THAT THE CIGAR HAS THE FORM OF A CICADA OF PAPER AND ON THE WHOLE IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE LIKENESS OF THE ROLL OF TOBACCO-LEAF TO THE CYLINDRICAL BODY OF THE INSECT CIGARRA WAS THE REASON THAT THE CIGARRO WAS SO CALLED
ABSURD OLD CONVENTIONS AND RIDICULOUS RESTRICTIONS HAD TO GIVE WAY OR WERE BROKEN THROUGH IN EVERY DIRECTION
ACCORDING TO MALTBY PORSON ONCE REMARKED THAT WHEN SMOKING BEGAN TO GO OUT OF FASHION LEARNING BEGAN TO GO OUT OF FASHION ALSO--WHICH SHOWS WHAT NONSENSE A LEARNED MAN COULD TALK
THE SMOKING OF TOBACCO IN ENGLAND SEEMS FROM THE FIRST TO HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE A MATTER OF PLEASURE THAN OF HYGIENE
BUT TO EXPLORE THAT LITTLE SECTION OF POPULAR MEDICINE WOULD BE FOREIGN TO MY PURPOSE
GRONOW RELATES THAT ONCE WHEN A LIGHT SEVRES SNUFF-BOX WHICH LORD PETERSHAM WAS USING WAS ADMIRED THE NOBLE OWNER REPLIED WITH A GENTLE LISP--"YES IT IS A NICE SUMMER BOX--BUT WOULD CERTAINLY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR WINTER WEAR THE WELL-KNOWN PURVEYOR WHO BOUGHT THE PRINCE REGENT'S CELLAR OF SNUFF AND WHO BOUGHT ALSO LORD PETERSHAM'S STOCK WAS THE FRIBOURG OF FRIBOURG AND TREYER WHOSE WELL-KNOWN OLD-FASHIONED SHOP AT THE TOP OF THE HAYMARKET WITH A BOW-WINDOW ON EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR STILL GIVES AN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FLAVOUR TO THAT THOROUGHFARE
A GERMAN GENTLEMAN WHO VISITED CAMBRIDGE IN JULY AND AUGUST 1710 REMARKED THAT IN THE GREEKS COFFEE-HOUSE IN THAT TOWN IN THE MORNING AND AFTER 3 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON YOU COULD MEET THE CHIEF PROFESSORS AND DOCTORS WHO READ THE PAPERS OVER A CUP OF COFFEE AND A PIPE OF TOBACCO
YEARS BEFORE HE HAD HELD THE CURACY OF SWAVESEY ABOUT NINE MILES OUT OF CAMBRIDGE WHERE HE REGULARLY PERFORMED THE DUTY
IF MEN FIND IT SUCH A PLEASURE TO SMOKE WHY SHOULDN'T WOMEN
VERY TIRED WITH WRITING THE PRELUDE IF HE HAD EVER FELT TIRED BY WRITING POETRY
THE 1843 QUOTATION IS FROM A BOOK BY MRS ROMER IN WHICH SHE SAYS--"THE BEGGARS IN THE STREETS HAVE PAPER CIGARS CALLED CIGARETTES IN THEIR MOUTHS THE WORDING HERE WOULD SEEM TO SHOW THAT CIGARETTES WERE NOT THEN FAMILIAR TO ENGLISH PEOPLE
THE PIPE WITH SOLEMN INTERPOSING PUFF MAKES HALF A SENTENCE AT A TIME ENOUGH
THREE HEARTS IF OFFERED WITH A GRACE ONE THINKS NOT OF REFUSING
COLTON WAS IN SUCCESSION RECTOR OF TIVERTON AND VICAR OF KEW BUT ON LEAVING KEW BECAME A WINE-MERCHANT IN SOHO
WHILE SMOKING ANYWHERE WITH A LADY WOULD IN THE EARLIER DAYS HAVE BEEN CLASSED AS AN ALMOST DISGRACEFUL SOCIAL CRIME
VII SMOKING UNFASHIONABLE
THEY ARE DESCRIBED BY TOM BROWN AS A CHARMING PHILLIS OR TWO WHO INVITED YOU BY THEIR AMOROUS GLANCES INTO THEIR SMOAKY TERRITORIES ADMISSION COST LITTLE
BUT HE ADMITS INIQUITY CORNER AS THE SPACE AT THE EAST END ON EACH SIDE OF THE ALTAR WAS CALLED MAY OCCASIONALLY HAVE EFFECTUALLY SHELTERED CARD-PLAYING
THE TRADITION IS CRYSTALLIZED IN THE STORY OF THE SCHOOLBOY WHO BEING ASKED WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SIR WALTER RALEIGH REPLIED
TABLES DICE CARDS AND STORE OF TOBACCO-PIPES
BURTON WAS A MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENTS OF OLIVER AND RICHARD CROMWELL FROM 1656 TO 1659 AND MADE A PRACTICE--FOR WHICH HISTORICAL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN AND ARE MUCH HIS DEBTORS--OF TAKING NOTES OF THE DEBATES AS HE SAT IN THE HOUSE
LATER VICTORIAN DAYS 179 XII
HE MADE CHOICE OF ONE WITH A NOD OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FILLED HIS PIPE LIGHTED IT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS PISTOL-FLINT AND SMOKED WITH INFINITE COMPOSURE DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THE SERMON
THEIR TITLES ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR STYLE
IF YOU WANTED TO SMOKE WHEN TRAVELLING YOU HAD EITHER TO CONTRIVE TO GET A COMPARTMENT TO YOURSELF OR TO ARRANGE TERMS WITH YOUR FELLOW-TRAVELLERS
THE EARLIEST REFERENCE TO SUCH USE MAY BE FOUND IN BEN JONSON'S BARTHOLOMEW FAIR 1614 WHERE IN THE FIRST SCENE HUMPHREY WASPE SAYS
IT IS AGREEABLE WITH MIRTH OR SADNESS WITH FEASTING AND WITH FASTING
AFTER ITS FAILURE LAMB WROTE TO HAZLITT--"WE ARE DETERMINED NOT TO BE CAST DOWN
THEY WERE LONG OR OVAL AND WERE USUALLY MADE OF BRASS
AND THE SMELL WHICH PERVADES THE STREETS MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY DELICIOUS TO THOSE WHO ARE EXTREMELY FOND OF SMOKING ON THE EVENING OF THE ELECTION AT EATANSWILL TUPMAN AND SNODGRASS RESORT TO THE COMMERCIAL ROOM OF THE PEACOCK INN WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS REDOLENT OF TOBACCO-SMOKE THE FUMES OF WHICH HAD COMMUNICATED A RATHER DINGY HUE TO THE WHOLE ROOM AND MORE ESPECIALLY TO THE DUSTY RED CURTAINS WHICH SHADED THE WINDOWS HERE AMONG OTHERS WERE THE DIRTY-FACED MAN WITH A CLAY PIPE THE VERY RED-FACED MAN BEHIND A CIGAR AND THE MAN WITH A BLACK EYE WHO SLOWLY FILLED A LARGE DUTCH PIPE WITH MOST CAPACIOUS BOWL
ONE SECTION OF THE MEMBERS WISHED FOR AN IMPROVED SMOKING-ROOM--THEY CALLED THE EXISTING ROOM WHICH WAS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE--AN INFAMOUS HOLE"--WHILE THE MORE OLD-FASHIONED AND MORE INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS OBJECTED TO ANY IMPROVEMENT
WE MAY SHREWDLY SUSPECT THAT THE PORTRAIT OF WESTERN IS SOMEWHAT OVER-COLOURED AND CANNOT FAIRLY BE TAKEN AS TYPICAL
THE AFFAIR HAPPENED IN ST MARY'S CHURCH AT NOTTINGHAM WHEN ARCHBISHOP BLACKBOURN OF YORK WAS THERE ON A VISITATION
GEORGE WITHER 1588-1667 THE YEAR 1660 THAT RESTORED CHARLES II TO HIS THRONE RESTORED A GAIETY AND BRIGHTNESS NOT TO SAY FRIVOLITY OF TONE THAT HAD LONG BEEN ABSENT FROM ENGLISH LIFE
MONOGRAMS AND DESIGNS WERE STAMPED OR MOULDED UPON THE BOWLS AND ON THE STEMS BUT MORE GENERALLY UPON THE SPUR OR FLAT HEEL OF THE PIPE
NUMBER FOUR CONTAINS EVIDENCE OF THE DISTASTE FOR SMOKING AMONG THE BEAUX IN THE LINES
YOU ARE IN A CONFUSION OF WINE AND ROARING AND HUNTING AND TOBACCO AND HEAVEN BE PRAISED YOU TOO CAN PRETTY WELL BEAR IT BUT GRAY HAD NO OBJECTION TO TOBACCO
NO MENTION IN PRINT OF A SMOKING-ROOM HAS BEEN FOUND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OXFORD DICTIONARY EARLIER THAN 1689
AND IN 1698 THEY ISSUED A PAPER DEALING IN GREAT DETAIL WITH MATTERS OF DRESS AND DEPORTMENT
IN A LETTER TO MONSIEUR DE ROHAN THE AMBASSADOR DECLARED THAT WHILE THE EARLS AND THE COUNSEL WERE PLEADING THEIR LORDSHIPS GUZZLED AND SMOKED
THE LATE LADY DOROTHY NEVILL WHO LIVED TO SEE THE NEW TRIUMPH OF TOBACCO SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT THE GREATEST MINOR CHANGE IN SOCIAL HABITS WHICH SHE HAD WITNESSED WAS THAT IN THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED TOWARDS SMOKING WHICH IN HER YOUTH AND EVEN LATER WAS EXCEPT IN CERTAIN WELL-DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDED AS LITTLE LESS THAN A HEINOUS CRIME LADY DOROTHY REMARKED THAT SMOKING-ROOMS IN COUNTRY HOUSES WERE ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN"--BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE CORRECT AS WE SHALL SEE IN THE EXPERIENCES OF PROFESSOR VON HOLTZENDORFF TO BE MENTIONED DIRECTLY--AND THAT SUCH GENTLEMEN AS WISHED TO SMOKE AFTER THE LADIES HAD GONE TO BED USED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO GO EITHER TO THE SERVANTS HALL OR TO THE HARNESS-ROOM IN THE STABLES WHERE AT NIGHT SOME SORT OF ROUGH PREPARATION WAS GENERALLY MADE FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATION
ON THE OCCASION OF THE ACCESSION OF JAMES I 1603 WHEN LONDON WAS GIVEN UP TO REJOICING AND REVELRY WE ARE TOLD THAT TOBACCONISTS I.E SMOKERS FILLED UP WHOLE TAVERNES KING JAMES HIMSELF IS AN UNWILLING WITNESS TO THE POPULARITY OF TOBACCO
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HE GOES ON TO DESCRIBE HIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PRACTICE OF SMOKING IN WORDS THAT SUGGEST THE PLEASURABLE NATURE OF THE EXPERIENCE
NOW THIS MAGNIFICENT APARTMENT WITH ITS SPLENDID BARRELLED CEILING WHICH A WELL-KNOWN ARCHITECTURAL WRITER MR STANLEY C
NEPOS PRODUCING SHORT CLAY SEE HERE UNCLE
QUEEN ELIZABETH'S SECRETARY OF STATE SIR ROBERT CECIL WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A SMOKER
ACCORDING TO AN INTERVIEW WITH A CHICAGO HOTEL PROPRIETOR THE FAIR SMOKERS SELECT THEIR CIGARS AS MEN DO EITHER BLACK AND STRONG OR LIGHT ACCORDING TO TASTE HOW IN THE WORLD ELSE COULD THEY SELECT THEM
FOR IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE OF LADIES OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER I NEVER SAW A WOMAN--NOT A BASKET WOMAN OR A GIPSY--SMOKE BEFORE THIS LAST REMARK IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT

IN TAVERNS OF COURSE THE CHURCHWARDEN--BELOVED OF CARLYLE AND TENNYSON--WAS USUALLY SMOKED TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF SHANDYGAFF
HIS SHOP IS THE RANDEVOUS OF SPITTING WHERE MEN DIALOGUE WITH THEIR NOSES AND THEIR COMMUNICATION IS SMOAKE

ONE OF THE LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS HOWEVER IN THE FASHION PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS IS THE ADVENT OF SMOKING JACKETS FOR LADIES
THE ONLY MENTION MADE OF TOBACCO BY RALEIGH HIMSELF OCCURS IN A TESTAMENTARY NOTE MADE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HIS EXECUTION IN 1618
WHILE AT KEW HE IS SAID TO HAVE KEPT CIGARS UNDER THE PULPIT WHERE HE SAID THE TEMPERATURE WAS EXACTLY RIGHT
AY DE MI WE ARE SUCH STUFF GONE WITH A PUFF THEN THINK AND SMOKE TOBACCO IN THE LATER YEARS OF HIS LIFE SPENT AT BRANTWOOD RUSKIN'S GUESTS FOUND THAT SMOKING WAS NOT ALLOWED EVEN AFTER DINNER

IT HAS ENGRAVED ON THE SIDES THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF ITS OWNER--"BARNABAS BARKER WYVENHOE ESSEX THE SIMILAR BOXES LATER MADE IN ENGLAND USUALLY HAD EMBOSSED ORNAMENTATION
I SEE SIR THERE IS A CRUMB OF TOBACCO IN IT
THE EARLIEST NOTICES OF CIGARS IN ENGLISH BOOKS OCCUR IN ACCOUNTS OF TRAVEL IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL AND IN THE SPANISH COLONIES AND IN SUCH NOTICES THE PHONETIC SPELLING OF SEGAR OFTEN OCCURS
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK I HAVE HAD IT
LATER HE PRINTED AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES A TRANSLATION OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THIS COUNTRY IN 1878
BEN JONSON HAS LET US INTO SOME OF THEIR SECRETS OF ADULTERATION--THE TREATMENT OF THE LEAF WITH OIL AND THE LEES OF SACK THE INCREASE OF ITS WEIGHT BY OTHER ARTIFICIAL ADDITIONS TO ITS MOISTURE WASHING IT IN MUSCADEL AND GRAINS KEEPING IT IN GREASED LEATHER AND OILED RAGS BURIED IN GRAVEL UNDER GROUND AND BY LIKE DEVICES
ONE WAS IMPORTED FROM SPANISH AMERICA WHICH UP TO 1639 HAYNE CALLS VARINAES AND AFTER THAT DATE SPANISH
AND BY AT LEAST 1830 THEY WERE BEING FREELY IF PRIVATELY SMOKED
BUT JOHNSON DID NOT SMOKE AND I DOUBT WHETHER ANY OF THE OTHERS DID
IT IS SAID IN ITS EARLIER DAYS TO HAVE BEEN A COUNTRY HOUSE OF SIR WALTER'S AND ACCORDING TO LEGEND IT WAS IN HIS DINING-ROOM IN THIS HOUSE THAT HE HAD HIS FIRST PIPE
FAST ETONIAN WELL OLD BOY I MUST HAVE MY SMOKE

IT MAY STILL BE OCCASIONALLY SEEN AT THE PRESENT TIME IN THE FORM OF THE TWIST WITH ALTERNATE BROWN OR BLACK AND YELLOW COILS WHICH UP TO QUITE A RECENT DATE WAS A TOLERABLY FREQUENT ADORNMENT OF TOBACCONISTS SHOPS BUT IS NOW RARE
IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT DICKENS SPEAKS OF THE THREE WORTHIES AS PROFESSED SMOKERS A REMARK WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SUCH DARE-DEVILS MEN WHO WOULD TAKE CIGARS AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND FOR ENJOYMENT AND NOT MERELY OUT OF A COMPLIMENTARY ACQUIESCENCE IN SOME ONE ELSE'S WISH WERE COMPARATIVELY RARE
YOUR CONDUCT SIR IS WHAT A CHRISTIAN WOULD CALL PROFANE AND A GENTLEMAN VULGAR AT OXFORD IN NOVEMBER 1859 THE VICE-CHANCELLOR AND PROCTORS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WHICH SHOWS THAT AN OCCASIONAL OUTBREAK OF BAD MANNERS MIGHT HAPPEN ON THE ISIS AS ON THE CAM

I HOPE YOU HAVE IT AND ARE THIS MINUTE DRINKING THE CHOCOLATE AND THAT THE SMELL OF THE BRAZIL TOBACCO HAS NOT AFFECTED IT THE EXPLANATION OF ALL THIS TOBACCO FOR MISTRESS DINGLEY IS TO BE FOUND IN SWIFT'S LETTER TO STELLA OF OCTOBER 23 1711
DR SUMNER HEAD MASTER OF HARROW WHO DIED IN 1771 WAS DEVOTED TO HIS PIPE
AND OCCASIONALLY A GALLANT WOULD HAVE LOOKING-GLASS SET IN HIS BOX SO THAT WHEN HE TOOK IT OUT TO OBTAIN TOBACCO HE COULD AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A VIEW OF HIS OWN DELECTABLE PERSON
WE ARE MASHERS YOU BET WITH THE LIGHT CIGARETTE AND THE QUITE IRREPROACHABLE STICK NOWADAYS THE CIGARETTE IS IN SUCH UNIVERSAL USE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THUS TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF MAN SANE OR INANE
MEANWHILE HE SMOKES AND LAUGHS AT MERRY TALE OR PUN AMBIGUOUS OR CONUNDRUM QUAINT BUT THE POOR SHILLINGLESS WRETCH CAN ONLY DOZE AT HOME IN GARRET VILE AND WITH A WARMING PUFF REGALE CHILL'D FINGERS
MEN IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS TOBACCO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DIVISIBLE INTO THREE CLASSES--THOSE WHO RESPECTED AND FOLLOWED AND OBEYED THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY AND THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKED OR DID NOT SMOKE IN ACCORDANCE THEREWITH
MUMFORD TOBACCONIST WAS AT THE FAULCON LAURENCE LANE
BUT HE COULD NOT SAY WHETHER THE APOTHECARIES GROCERS AND CHANDLERS SHOPS WHERE TOBACCO WAS ALSO SOLD WERE INCLUDED IN THAT NUMBER
THE COURT-BOOKS OF THE SKINNERS COMPANY OF LONDON SHOW THAT IN PREPARATION FOR THEIR ANNUAL ELECTION DINNER IN 1694 THE COOK APPEARED BEFORE THE COURT AND PRODUCED A BILL OF FARE WHICH WITH SOME ALTERATIONS WAS AGREED TO
REES IN HIS DIARY OF THE SAME SIEGE NOTED--"I HAVE GIVEN UP SMOKING TOBACCO AND HAVE TAKEN TO TEA-LEAVES AND NEEM-LEAVES AND GUAVA FRUIT-LEAVES INSTEAD WHICH THE POOR SOLDIERS ARE ALSO CONSTANTLY USING THE NEEM-TREE IS BETTER KNOWN PERHAPS AS THE MARGOSA
THE CAPTAIN WAS A PROFESSED SMOKER
BUT THE STORY WAS A STOCK JEST LONG BEFORE IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH RALEIGH
WHEN KING JAMES I WAS ABOUT TO VISIT CAMBRIDGE THE VICE-CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY PUT FORTH SUNDRY REGULATIONS IN CONNEXION WITH THE ROYAL VISIT IN WHICH MAY BE FOUND THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE
THESE WERE SENTIMENTS WORTHY OF KING JAMES
NOW I PRAY GENTLEMEN WHAT GOOD DOES THIS STINKING TOBACCO DO YOU
FORSTER SAYS THAT DICKENS LIVED TO HAVE LARGER AND WIDER EXPERIENCE BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH TO STARTLE AS WELL AS AMUSE HIM IN THE SCENE DESCRIBED THE WORDS CIGAR AND CIGARETTE ARE USED INDIFFERENTLY BY THE NOVELIST BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR FROM THE DESCRIPTION AND FROM THE NUMBER SMOKED BY THE LADY IN AN HOUR OR TWO THAT IT WAS A CIGARETTE AND NOT A CIGAR PROPERLY SO CALLED WHICH WAS NEVER OUT OF HER MOUTH
AND THE CITY OF EXETER HAVING MADE A RETURN THE LORDS SENT A LIST OF THOSE WHICH ARE TO BE LICENSED AND ORDER THAT NO OTHERS BE PERMITTED TO SELL IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY OF SOMERSET THE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE SENT PRESENTMENTS TO THE COUNCIL IN 1632 OF PERSONS WITHIN THE HUNDRED OF MILVERTON AND KINGSBURY WEST THOUGHT FIT TO SELL TOBACCO BY RETAIL
THE FIRST HOUSE WAS OPENED IN ST MICHAEL'S ALLEY CORNHILL IN 1652
THE GOOD FOLK AT METHWOLD MAY HAVE BEEN ADEPTS AT PETTY TYRANNY BUT SUCH AN ABSURD REGULATION MUST SOON HAVE BECOME A DEAD LETTER
HIS MAJESTY KINDLY SUGGESTED THAT DOCTORS WHO BELIEVED IN TOBACCO AS A REMEDIAL AGENT SHOULD TAKE THEMSELVES AND THEIR MEDICINE OF POLLUTION OFF TO JOIN THE INDIANS
IT ABATES HUNGER AND YET WILL GET ONE A GOOD STOMACH
A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES IN 1897 SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS A BOY HE KNEW AN OLD CALVINIST MINISTER WHO USED TO SMOKE A DRIED MIXTURE OF THE LEAVES OF HOREHOUND YARROW AND FOAL'S FOOT INTERMINGLED WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF TOBACCO
ANGELO SAYS THAT THEY WOULD SOMETIMES MEET AT SUCH RESORTS OF THE LOW AS THE BELL THE COAL HOLE OR THE COACH AND HORSES AND WOULD ENTER INTO THE COMMON CHAT OF THE ROOM SMOKE AND DRINK TOGETHER AND THEN SOMETIMES EARLY SOMETIMES LATE SHAKE HANDS AT THE DOOR--LOOK UP AT THE STARS SAY IT IS A PRETTY NIGHT AND DEPART ONE FOR THE ADELPHI THE OTHER TO ST JAMES'S STREET EACH TO HIS BACHELOR'S BED BUT OUTSIDE THE FASHIONABLE WORLD PIPES WERE STILL IN FULL BLAST AND IN MANY PLACES OF RESORT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AS BECLOUDED WITH TOBACCO-SMOKE AS IN EARLIER DAYS
AS I WALKED BETWEEN WESTMINSTER HALL AND THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL AND SO THOROW THE CITIE WHERE I SAW AND DID PITTY MY COUNTRY MEN'S CASES WITH FIERY-SMOKE FACES SUCKING AND DRINKING A FILTHIE WEEDE STINKING TOBACCO-SELLING WAS SOMETIMES CURIOUSLY COMBINED WITH OTHER TRADES
CLARKSON HIS BIOGRAPHER RELATES THAT ON ONE OCCASION PENN CALLED TO SEE SOME OLD FRIENDS AT BURLINGTON WHO HAD BEEN SMOKING BUT WHO IN CONSIDERATION FOR HIS FEELINGS HAD PUT THEIR PIPES AWAY
IT INCLUDES ALL SORTS OF EATABLES AND DRINKABLES IN ASTONISHING QUANTITIES
THE STORY WAS FIRST ASSOCIATED WITH RALEIGH BY A WRITER IN 1708 IN A MAGAZINE CALLED THE BRITISH APOLLO
BUT THEY DID NOT SMOKE
IT IS NOT YET HOWEVER UNIVERSAL
SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS SAID TO HAVE SMOKED IMMODERATELY
POYNTZ'S PARKE AT ACTON TOOKE A PIPE OF TOBACCO WHICH MADE THE LADIES QUITT IT TILL HE HAD DONE BUT THIS OBJECTION WHETHER GENERAL OR NOT SOON VANISHED FOR AS WE HAVE SEEN IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER THE GALLANT OF ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN DAYS MADE A PRACTICE OF SMOKING IN HIS LADY'S PRESENCE
SIR JAMES MURRAY IN THE GREAT OXFORD DICTIONARY GIVES THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING EXTRACT FROM AN UNPUBLISHED MS
URSULA THE PIG-WOMAN AND REFRESHMENT-BOOTH KEEPER IN BARTHOLOMEW FAIR IN BEN JONSON'S PLAY OF THAT NAME SAYS TO HER ASSISTANT
WISHING YOU TO MAKE STORE THEREOF FOR I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO HAVE THE LIKE I HAVE SENT YOU OF TWO SORTS
APPARENTLY THIS MODEST ALLOWANCE OF A DAILY EVENING PIPE WAS THE EXTENT OF MILTON'S INDULGENCE IN TOBACCO
HOURS 10 11 AND 12 SMOAKED THREE PIPES OF VIRGINIA
LONG BEFORE HIS DEATH IN 1618 IT HAD BECOME FASHIONABLE AS WE SHALL SEE IN ALL RANKS OF SOCIETY
FARTHER ON WHEN THE HOSPITABLE MR WILSON TAKES THE WEARY WAYFARERS IN PARSON ADAMS LOSES NO TIME IN FILLING HIMSELF WITH ALE AS FIELDING PUTS IT AND LIGHTING HIS PIPE
THE FASHIONABLE WAY WAS TO EXPEL THE SMOKE THROUGH THE NOSE
ABOVE HIS HEAD IS A CROWN
FROM 1820 TO 1830 HE WAS EDITOR OF THE NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE AND IS REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN SO VERY UNBUSINESSLIKE IN HIS METHODS THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS DIFFICULTY IN GETTING PROOFS CORRECTED AND RETURNED IN GOOD TIME
A BRIEF AND ACCURATE TREATISE CONCERNING THE TAKING OF THE FUME OF TOBACCO WHICH VERY MANY IN THESE DAYES DOE TOO LICENCIOUSLY USE
HE WAS TAKEN TO WHITEHALL AT NIGHT AND KEPT IN A LARGE ROOM WITH SOME SIXTY OTHER PRISONERS TILL DAYLIGHT WHEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDROOM WHICH HE SAYS I THOUGHT TO BE HELL
THERE ARE STILL SOME PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON'S DELUSION THAT SMOKING PROMOTES DRINKING ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE PROVES THE CONTRARY AND HISTORIC EVIDENCE ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS DRINKING AFTER DINNER SHOWS THAT IT WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CIGAR FOLLOWED BY THAT OF THE CIGARETTE WHICH ABSOLUTELY KILLED THE OLD BAD AFTER-DINNER HABITS
ANOTHER FOREIGN VISITOR TO ENGLAND THE ABBE LE BLANC WHO WAS OVER HERE ABOUT 1730 FOUND ENGLISH CUSTOMS RATHER TRYING
AMONG THEM IS THE WARNING TO TAKE HEED OF BEING OVERCOME WITH STRONG DRINK OR TOBACCO WHICH MANY BY CUSTOME ARE BROUGHT INTO BONDAG TO THE CREATURE THE ABERDEEN FRIENDS THEMSELVES A LITTLE LATER WERE GREATLY CONCERNED AT THE INCREASING INDULGENCE IN SUPERFLUOUS APPARELL AND IN VAIN RECREATIONS AMONG THE YOUNG ONES
SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN ARE SMOKING TOBACCO IN LONG PIPES
TO 4S
IT IS NOT SO VERY LONG AGO THAT AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER HEARD A WORKING-MAN COURTEOUSLY ASK A SCOTTISH FISH-WIFE WHO HAD ENTERED A SMOKING-COMPARTMENT OF THE TRAIN WHETHER SHE OBJECTED TO SMOKING
BUT THE APOTHECARIES WERE THE MOST USUAL SALESMEN AND THEIR SHOPS AND THE ORDINARIES WERE THE CUSTOMARY DAY MEETING-PLACES FOR THE MORE FASHIONABLE SMOKERS
AND IF SMOKING WERE PERMITTED ON SUCH OCCASIONS--AS SHIFT'S BOASTING PROMISES WOULD APPEAR TO INDICATE--THEN IT MAY BE REASONABLY INFERRED THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH DID NOT ENTERTAIN THE OBJECTIONS TO THE NEW PRACTICE THAT HER SUCCESSOR KING JAMES SET FORTH WITH SUCH VEHEMENCE IN HIS FAMOUS COUNTERBLASTE TO TOBACCO THERE IS HOWEVER NO POSITIVE EVIDENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER TO SHOW WHAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE VIRGIN QUEEN TOWARDS TOBACCO REALLY WAS
DEPEND UPON IT IT CONTAINS GOOD MATTER TO LAMB A BOOK READ BEST OVER A PIPE
TOBACCO'S A MUSICIAN AND IN A PIPE DELIGHTETH IT DESCENDS IN A CLOSE THROUGH THE ORGAN OF THE NOSE WITH A RELISH THAT INVITETH THESE ARE MERELY A FEW EXAMPLES OF BOTH THE PRAISE AND THE ABUSE WHICH WERE LAVISHED UPON TOBACCO AT THIS EARLY STAGE IN THE HISTORY OF SMOKING
THE FIRST PIPES OF TOBACCO SMOKED IN ENGLAND 11 II
THE VULGAR THING FALLS UPON THE FLOOR AND TOM IS ASHAMED TO CLAIM HIS PROPERTY AND SO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS OWNERSHIP OF A PIPE
THE YARD OF CLAY IS PROVIDED GRATIS FOR MEMBERS AND IT IS TO ITS ALMOST UNIVERSAL USE SAYS MR PETER RAYLEIGH IN HIS BOOK ON THE COGERS AND FLEET STREET THAT COGERS OWE THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE PRESENT QUARTERS
SOME OF THE REFERENCES TO WOMEN SMOKERS OCCUR IN CURIOUS CONNEXIONS
THIS ROLL REPRESENTED WHAT WAS CALLED SPUN OR TWIST TOBACCO
WE KNOW ALSO THAT THE ROUNDHEAD SOLDIERS SMOKED IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DID THEM NO CREDIT
WITH THESE AIDS TO VANITY ARE A CASE OF TOBACCO-PIPES VALUED AT FOURPENCE HALF AN OUNCE OF TOBACCO VALUED AT SIXPENCE AND THREE PENCE IN COIN OR AS IT IS QUAINTLY WORDED IN MONEY AND GOLDE SATIRISTS OF COURSE MADE FUN OF THE SMOKER'S POCKETFUL OF APPARATUS
HE IS SAID HOWEVER ON ONE OCCASION WHEN KING EDWARD AS PRINCE OF WALES DINED WITH HIM IN DOWNING STREET TO HAVE TOYED WITH A CIGARETTE OUT OF COURTESY TO HIS ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST
A PARTICULARLY ABSURD RULE THAT MAINTAINS ITS GROUND HERE AND THERE IS THAT WHICH FORBIDS SMOKING IN THE LIBRARY OF A CLUB
THE LATE JOSEPH KNIGHT WHO REVIEWED ROSSETTI'S VOLUMES IN THE ATHENAEUM VOUCHED FOR THE TRUTH OF THIS RELATION WHICH HE HAD HEARD NOT ONLY FROM WOOLNER BUT ALSO FROM TENNYSON'S BROTHER SEPTIMUS
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
THE LATE KING EDWARD AT THAT TIME PRINCE OF WALES IS SAID TO HAVE SYMPATHIZED STRONGLY WITH THE DEFEATED MINORITY AT WHITE'S AND TO HAVE INTERESTED HIMSELF IN THE FOUNDATION OF THE MARLBOROUGH
OFTEN HE CONTINUES--THE VERSES MAY BE ROUGHLY TRANSLATED--OFTEN WHEN I AM IN ALPINE SOLITUDES TIED IN A CHAIN TO A FEW COMPANIONS CLINGING TO THE ROPE WHILE BARBARIANS LEAD THE WAY CARRYING IN MY HANDS AN ICE-AXE +KRUSTALLOPLEGA CHERSIN AXINEN PHERON+ AND BREATHLESS CRAWLING UP THE SNOW-COVERED PLAIN--THEN WHEN GROANING I REACH THE SUMMIT EITHER PULLED UP OR ON FOOT HOW HAVE I RESTED ON MY BACK ON THE ROCKS CHARMING MY SOUL WITH THY DIVINE CLOUDS

IN HIS LETTER OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT CARLYLE WROTE--"DEAR RUSKIN YOU HAVE SENT ME A MAGNIFICENT BOX OF CIGARS
AND THIS COMING TO MR DISNEY'S EARS HE FORBAD THEM BEING BROUGHT THITHER AND WITH A BECOMING SPIRIT REMONSTRATED WITH THE ARCHBISHOP UPON THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT AT THE SAME TIME TELLING HIS GRACE THAT HIS VESTRY SHOULD NOT BE CONVERTED INTO A SMOKING-ROOM ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MR DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING--HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
HIS GRACE OF NEWCASTLE WOKE UP LEFT HIS COACH AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BEING ACCORDING TO HIS DUCHESS THE LAST TO RIDE OFF THE FATAL FIELD LEAVING HIS COACH AND SIX BEHIND HIM
IT IS SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT THAT DICKENS IN THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP 1840 MAKES THAT REPULSIVE DWARF QUILP SMOKE CIGARS
WHEN YOU HAVE FILLED WITHOUT DELAY SHUT DOWN THE LID OR SIXPENCE PAY A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES IN 1908 MENTIONED THAT HE POSSESSED TWO OF THESE OLD PENNY-IN-THE-SLOT TOBACCO-BOXES AND HAD COME ACROSS ANOTHER IN A DEALER'S SHOP OF A SOMEWHAT PECULIAR MAKE ABOUT WHICH HE WISHED TO GET INFORMATION
THE OLD WOMAN SAID THE JOURNAL HAD DWINDLED INTO A SMALL COMPASS BUT SHE WAS FREE FROM PAIN RETAINING ALL HER FACULTIES TO THE LAST AND ENJOYING HER PIPE
BUT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THIS INDISCRIMINATE AND UNNECESSARY USE OF THE SIGN THERE EXISTED A CONTINUOUS ASSOCIATION OF THE BLACK BOY WITH THE TOBACCO TRADE
SMOKING FASHIONABLE AND UNIVERSAL 25 III
OVER A PIPE WHY THE WORDS BRING UP INNUMERABLE PLEASANT ASSOCIATIONS
I SAW HEE HAD A FLASHY EMPTY NOTION OF RELIGION
A CUSTOMER AT AN ORDINARY SAYS
IN 1699 MR BRUTTON TOBACCONIST WAS TO BE FOUND AT THE THREE CROWNS UNDER THE ROYAL EXCHANGE
SMOKING IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSERTED WAS NEVER PRACTISED COMMONLY IN ENGLISH CHURCHES
IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF CHARLES I WRITTEN BY DR GEORGE BATES PRINCIPAL PHYSICIAN TO HIS MAJESTY AND TO CHARLES II ALSO WE READ THAT WHEN THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT PRESIDED OVER BY BRADSHAW CONDEMNING THE KING TO DEATH BY SEVERING HIS HEAD FROM HIS BODY HAD BEEN READ THE SOLDIERS TREATED THE FALLEN MONARCH WITH GREAT INDIGNITY AND BARBARITY
GEORGE THRESHER KEPT A SHOPPE IN ROMFORD AND SOLD TOBACCO THERE
THE LEAVES THEREOF BEING DRIED AND BROUGHT INTO POWDER
THE LATTER CLAUSE ADDS MR LIVINGSTONE WOULD ALMOST SUGGEST THAT THE TOBACCO WAS TO BE SOLD FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES,"--AS I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WAS--"AND THAT THE SMOKERS WERE PROBABLY IN THE HABIT AT THEIR SYMPOSIUMS OF USING EVEN AS THEY MAY STILL I DARE SAY OTHER INDULGENCES NOT SO SOOTHING IN THEIR EFFECTS AS THE COVETED WEED"--A SUGGESTION FOR WHICH THERE SEEMS LITTLE FOUNDATION IN THE CLAUSE TO WHICH MR LIVINGSTONE REFERS
WELL THAT IS AT LEAST SOMETHING FOR WHICH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE PATHS OF REVERIE ARE THE PATHS OF PLEASANTNESS AND PEACE AND PROBLEMS CAN USUALLY AFFORD TO WAIT
MR H.M
AFTER SATIRIZING FIRST THE MONSTROUS CONJUNCTIONS IN SIGNS OF DOG AND GRIDIRON CAT AND FIDDLE AND SO FORTH
A PLACE ON THE BOX OR FRONT OF A PRIME SET-OUT IS INDEED A CONSIDERABLE TREAT
AND NO DOUBT THE SINGULARITY OF HIS SMOKING APPARATUS WAS OF A PIECE WITH THE SINGULARITY OF HIS ATTIRE
0 NINETEEN POUNDS WORTH OF TOBACCO CONSIDERING THE THEN VALUE OF MONEY WAS NO SMALL STOCK FOR A MERCER-TOBACCONIST TO CARRY
THE USE OF THE WORD IN CONNEXION WITH TOBACCO MAY LIKE THAT OF EBOLITION HAVE SOME REFERENCE TO FURIOUS SMOKING BUT THE MEANING IS NOT CLEAR
THE TRAVELLERS ARE IN PALL MALL AND SMOKE CIGARS SO COSILY AND DREAM THEY CLIMB THE HIGHEST ALPS OR ROVE THE PLAINS OF MOSELAI THE WORLD FOR THEM HAS NOTHING NEW THEY HAVE EXPLORED ALL PARTS OF IT
AND SHEE AND THEY AND SOME OTHER OF HER FREINDS HAVE DINED THERE TOGETHER AND PAID THEIR SHARE FOR THEIR DINNER SHEE BEING MANY TIMES MORE WILLING TO DINE THERE THAN AT AN INNE OR TAVERNE ELIZABETH WAS EVIDENTLY OF A SOCIABLE TURN AND THOUGH SHE TURNED HER NOSE UP AT A TAVERN THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE FESTIVE DINNERS AT MR THRESHER'S SHOPP WHERE MISTRESS SAVAGE INDULGED HER TASTE FOR ALE AND TOBACCO AND SIMILAR PLEASURES AT AN INN OR TAVERN
A ROLL OF TOBACCO IT MAY BE NOTED WAS A COMMON FORM OF PAYMENT TO THE FLEET PARSONS FOR THEIR SCOUNDRELLY SERVICES
BUT WHEN HEE CAME TO TAKE HIS PIPE HEE HAD SUCH AN APPREHENSION THAT THE DEVILL DID INDEED STAND BY HIM AND DOE THE OFFICE AS HEE DREAMED THAT HEE WAS STRUCK SPEECHLESS FOR A TIME AND WHEN HEE CAME TO HIMSELF HEE THREW HIS TOBACCO IN THE FIRE AND HIS PIPES AT THE WALLS
BUT GOOD AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT SEEMS TO BE LACKING
IT MAY FURTHER BE ADDED THAT THOUGH THE USE OF TOBACCO WAS KNOWN AND PRACTISED ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE FOR SOME TIME BEFORE SMOKING BECAME COMMON IN ENGLAND--IT WAS TAKEN TO SPAIN FROM MEXICO BY A PHYSICIAN ABOUT 1560 AND JEAN NICOT ABOUT THE SAME TIME SENT TOBACCO SEEDS TO FRANCE--YET SUCH USE WAS EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES
BY 1830 SMOKING HAD SO FAR COME IN AGAIN THAT A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WERE SMOKERS
IN LATER DAYS MANY AND VARIOUS ADDITIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE MANY COVERINGS OF THE BOX RECORDING PUBLIC EVENTS OF INTEREST
IN THE WEST INDIES IT HATH DIVERS NAMES ACCORDING TO THE SEVERALL PLACES AND COUNTRIES WHERE IT GROWETH AND IS USED
TOBACCO WHATEVER ITS ENEMIES MAY HAVE SAID OR MAY YET SAY IS THE FRIEND OF PEACE THE FOE OF STRIFE AND THE PROMOTER OF GENIALITY AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP
THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED WAS TOLD LONG AFTERWARDS IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN DECEMBER 1773 BY JOHN DISNEY RECTOR OF SWINDERBY LINCOLNSHIRE THE GRANDSON OF THE MR DISNEY WHO AT THE TIME OF THE ARCHBISHOP'S VISIT TO ST MARY'S WAS INCUMBENT OF THAT CHURCH
THE LATTER HAS A CIGAR IN ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER OFFERS COINS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR
THIS OVAL BOX WELL FILLED WITH BEST TOBACCO FINELY MILLED BEATS ALL ANTICYRA'S PRETENCES TO DISENGAGE THE ENCUMBERED SENSES
TASTE THIS SNUFF SIR HARRY SAYS THE DUKE TIS GOOD RAPPEE REPLIES SIR HARRY RIGHT STRASBURGH I ASSURE YOU AND OF MY OWN IMPORTING SAYS THE KNOWING DUCAL VALET
A TOBACCONIST HAD A SHOP UPPON WAPPING WALL IN 1667 AT THE SIGN OF THE BLACK BOY AND PELICAN OTHER SIGNIFICANT EARLY TOBACCONISTS SIGNS WERE SIR WALTER RALEIGH THE VIRGINIAN AND THE TOBACCO ROLL SIR WALTER AS THE REPUTED INTRODUCER OF TOBACCO WAS NATURALLY CHOSEN AS A SIGN AND HIS PORTRAIT ADORNS SEVERAL SHOP-BILLS IN THE BANKS COLLECTION
IN TOWNLEY'S WELL-KNOWN TWO-ACT FARCE HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS 1759 THE SERVANTS TAKE THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES TITLES AND APE THEIR WAYS
HIS GRACE WAS IN A VERY BAD HUMOUR
TOBACCO HAD ALWAYS FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN THE PROVISION FOR TRADE FEASTS
AND FROM THE MINUTES OF THIS MEETING WE LEARN THAT BY GENERAL CONSENT IT WAS FORBIDDEN HENCEFORWARD TO SMOKE IN THE COURT ROOM WHILE DINING OR SITTING UNDER PENALTY OF HALF A CROWN
NEWCASTLE STROLLED TOWARDS HIS COACH TO SOLACE HIMSELF WITH A PIPE
HUNGARIANS POLES CROATS WALLACHIANS JEWS MOLDAVIANS GREEKS TURKS ALL DRESSED IN THEIR NATIONAL AND STINKING COSTUMES PROMENADE UP AND DOWN SMOKING ALL AND NONE EXCITING THE SLIGHTEST OBSERVATION
AH HE WAS A VERY SING'LAR MARN--A VERY SING'LAR MARN INDEED SOME MEN SEEM TO ACT UPON MARK TWAIN'S PRINCIPLE OF NEVER SMOKING WHEN ASLEEP OR AT MEALS AND NEVER REFRAINING AT ANY OTHER TIME
ANOTHER WITNESS TO THE DONS LOVE OF TOBACCO IS THOMAS WARTON
PUT OUT HER STOMACH FOLDED HER ARMS AND WITH HER PRETTY FACE COCKED UP SIDEWAYS AND HER CIGARETTE SMOKING AWAY LIKE A MANCHESTER COTTON MILL LAUGHED AND TALKED AND SMOKED IN THE MOST GENTLEMANLY MANNER I EVER BEHELD
SHE CERTAINLY SMOKED SIX OR EIGHT
LANE IS SAID TO HAVE GIVEN SIR WALTER RALEIGH AN INDIAN PIPE AND TO HAVE SHOWN HIM HOW TO USE IT
THE MARKET-PEOPLE HAVING THEIR MOUTHS PRIMED WITH TOBACCO AS A PRESERVATIVE BROUGHT THEIR PROVISIONS
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE SMOKE OF HERBS AND LEAVES OF VARIOUS KINDS WAS INHALED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN EUROPE GENERALLY LONG BEFORE TOBACCO WAS EVER HEARD OF ON THIS SIDE THE ATLANTIC
SIR SAMUEL GARTH 1660-1718 AFTER KING WILLIAM III WAS SETTLED ON THE THRONE THE SUM OF L600,000 WAS PAID TO THE DUTCH FROM THE ENGLISH EXCHEQUER FOR MONEY ADVANCED IN CONNEXION WITH HIS MAJESTY'S EXPEDITION AND THIS AMOUNT WAS PAID OFF BY TOBACCO DUTIES
BUT WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS INDEED THE ONCE ABUNDANT TOBACCONISTS SIGNS HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM OUR STREETS AS COMPLETELY AS THE EMBLEMS AND TOKENS OF OTHER TRADES
THACKERAY SIGNIFICANTLY MAKES RAWDON CRAWLEY A SMOKER--THE ACTION OF VANITY FAIR TAKES PLACE IN THE FIRST TWO DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
BUT THE PRACTICE CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN COMMON
MAY FOR THIS THE BOWL STILL UNEXCISED REJOICE THY HONEST SOUL
MRS ALICE MORSE EARLE IN HER INTERESTING BOOK ABOUNDING IN CURIOUS INFORMATION ON THE SABBATH IN PURITAN NEW ENGLAND SAYS THAT THE USE OF TOBACCO WAS ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE SABBATH WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE MEETING-HOUSE WHICH SINCE AT THAT DATE ALL THE HOUSES WERE CLUSTERED ROUND THE CHURCH-GREEN WAS EQUIVALENT TO NOT SMOKING IT AT ALL ON THE LORD'S DAY IF THE LAW WERE OBEYED
IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD THE SNUFF-BOX WAS ALL-POWERFUL
ONE OF THESE JUVENILE SMOKERS A CERTAIN TOM ROGERS YEARS AFTERWARDS DECLARED TO HEARNE THE OXFORD ANTIQUARY THAT HE NEVER WAS WHIPPED SO MUCH IN HIS LIFE AS HE WAS ONE MORNING FOR NOT SMOKING
A HAMPER
AT THE ATHENAEUM THE ONLY SMOKING-ROOM USED TO BE A COMBINED BILLIARD-AND SMOKING-ROOM IN THE BASEMENT
THIS IS A DIGRESSION HOWEVER WHICH HAS CARRIED US FAR AWAY FROM THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
COWPER APPRECIATED SNUFF BUT DID NOT CARE FOR SMOKING AND WHEN HE WROTE TO UNWIN DESCRIBING HIS NEW-MADE FRIEND IN TERMS OF ADMIRATION HE CONCLUDED--"SUCH A MAN IS MR BULL
AND WHEN HE GOES INTO THE INN GARDEN WITH THE HOST WHO IS WILLING TO TRUST HIM BOTH HOST AND PARSON LIGHT THEIR PIPES BEFORE BEGINNING TO GOSSIP
VIII SMOKING UNFASHIONABLE CONTINUED
AND WHAT A NUMBER THERE ARE BESIDES HE ADDS THAT DOE KEEPE HOUSES SET OPEN SHOPPES THAT HAVE NO OTHER TRADE TO LIVE BY BUT BY THE SELLING OF TOBACCO RICH SAYS HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT A LIST HAD BEEN RECENTLY MADE OF ALL THE HOUSES THAT TRADED IN TOBACCO IN AND NEAR ABOUT LONDON AND THAT IF A MAN MIGHT BELIEVE WHAT WAS CONFIDENTLY REPORTED THERE WERE FOUND TO BE UPWARDS OF 7000 HOUSES THAT LIVED BY THAT TRADE
THE NUMBER OF 7000 SEEMS VERY LARGE AND IS PERHAPS EXAGGERATED
SNUFF-TAKING WAS UNIVERSAL IN THE FASHIONABLE WORLD AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
IN 1663 THE COMPANY OF TOBACCO-PIPE MAKERS PETITIONED PARLIAMENT TO FORBID THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PIPE CLAY SINCE BY THE MANUFACTURE OF PIPES IN HOLLAND THEIR TRADE IS MUCH DAMAGED FURTHER THEY ASKED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THEIR CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT SO AS TO EMPOWER THEM TO REGULATE ABUSES AS MANY PERSONS ENGAGE IN THE TRADE WITHOUT LICENCE THE COMPANY'S REQUEST WAS GRANTED
IF SAM'S MOTHER-IN-LAW FLIES IN A PASSION AND BREAKS HIS PIPE HE STEPS OUT AND GETS ANOTHER
PENDENNIS WHEN HE COMES HOME THE FIRST TIME FROM OXBRIDGE BRINGS WITH HIM A LARGE BOX OF CIGARS OF STRANGE BRAND WHICH HE SMOKES NOT ONLY ABOUT THE STABLES AND GREENHOUSES WHERE THEY WERE GOOD FOR HIS MOTHER'S PLANTS AND WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY PLACES TO WHICH A MAN WHO WISHED TO SMOKE SHOULD BETAKE HIMSELF BUT IN HIS OWN STUDY WHICH RATHER SHOCKS HIS MOTHER
A BOX OF PIPES THE PROVIDENT SAMUEL WAS WELL FOUND FOR A LONG VOYAGE
FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND JUST TIME ENOUGH TO INFORM HIM OF THE CONFUSED STATE OF MY FEELINGS AND OF THE OCCASION
LET SOME ONE HE EXCLAIMS BRING BRYANT AND MAY'S FIRE WHICH STRIKES A LIGHT ONLY IF RUBBED ON THE BOX +ENENKATO TIS PUR BRUANTOMAIKON+ +KAUSAI D ADUNATON ME OUCHI PROS KISTE TRIBEU+ AND TAKING THE BEST AND BLACKEST BOWL AND PUTTING ON PERSIAN SLIPPERS SITTING ON THE SOFTEST COUCH I WILL LIGHT MY PIPE WITH MY FEET ON THE HEARTH AND I WILL CAST ASIDE ALL MORTAL CARE
THE SPANIARDES GENERALLY CALL IT TOBACCO
MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS SMOKED SOMETIMES APPARENTLY TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO CAUSE SCANDAL AMONG THEIR BRETHREN
GILES MOORE OF HORSTED KEYNES IN 1656 AND AGAIN IN 1662 PAID 1S
LATER AGAIN WHEN THE COUPLE O SAWBONES THE MEDICAL STUDENTS BEN ALLEN AND BOB SAWYER MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE THEY ARE DISCOVERED IN THE MORNING SEATED BY MR WARDLE'S KITCHEN FIRE SMOKING CIGARS
AT PRESENT HOWEVER ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE OPEN AND THE ROOM IS PURE ENOUGH FROM TOBACCO TO SUIT MY FATHER HIMSELF IN JULY 1832 HE AGAIN DATED A LETTER TO HIS SISTERS FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SMOKING-ROOM
BUT WICKED BACKSLIDERS EXISTED POOR SLAVES OF HABIT WHO WERE IN DUXBURY FIXED 10S
AND FOR WIVELISCOMBE MR HANCOCK SAYS IN HIS BOOK ON THAT OLD TOWN A MERCER AND A HOSIER WERE SELECTED
IN THAT ADMIRABLE BURLESQUE COMEDY BY BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER THE KNIGHT OF THE BURNING PESTLE 1613 THE CITIZEN'S WIFE ADDRESSING HERSELF EITHER TO THE GALLANTS ON THE STAGE OR TO HER FELLOW-SPECTATORS SITTING AROUND HER EXCLAIMS
HE SAID THIS WITH A SUAVITY AND A SMILE WHICH DISARMED ANY POSSIBLE OBJECTOR
OF COURSE IT WAS AT ONCE SUGGESTED THAT WOMEN WHO WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO IMITATE MASCULINE ATTIRE AND TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THE USUAL CONVENTIONS OF FEMININE DRESS WOULD NATURALLY SEEK TO IMITATE MEN IN OTHER WAYS ALSO
AND DRINKING THAT AGAINE FIE SAYES THE OTHER WHAT A STINKE IT MAKES
THEY MAY STILL BE FOUND IN SOME FARMHOUSES AND COUNTRY COTTAGES WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN RAIDED BY THE AGENTS OF DEALERS IN ANTIQUE FURNITURE AND IMPLEMENTS BUT EXAMPLES ARE RARE
AT LAST HE FINISHED HIS PIPE AND BEGAN TO PUT ON THE BLACK GOWN BUT ITS FOLDS WERE TROUBLESOME AND HE COULD NOT GET IT ON
DEKKER IN JAMES I'S TIME SPEAKS OF ROLL TOBACCO
SIR LEWIS STUKELY SOLD ALL THE TOBACCO AT PLIMOUTH OF WHICH FOR THE MOST PART OF IT I GAVE HIM A FIFT PART OF IT AS ALSO A ROLE FOR MY LORD ADMIRALL AND A ROLE FOR HIMSELF
THE FLORIDIANS WHEN THEY TRAVEL HAVE A KINDE OF HERBE DRYED WHICH WITH A CANE AND AN EARTHEN CUP IN THE END WITH FIRE AND THE DRIED HERBS PUT TOGETHER DO SMOKE THORO THE CANE THE SMOKE THEREOF WHICH SMOKE SATISFIETH THEIR HUNGER AND THEREWITH THEY LIVE FOURE OR FIVE DAYS WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINKE SMOKING WAS THUS CERTAINLY KNOWN TO HAWKINS IN 1565 BUT MUCH RELIANCE CANNOT BE PLACED ON THE STATEMENT IN THE STOW OF 1631 THAT HE FIRST MADE KNOWN THE PRACTICE IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THAT STATEMENT APPEARS IN NO EARLIER EDITION OF THE CHRONICLES MOREOVER AS OPPOSED TO THE ALLEGATION THAT TOBACCO WAS NOT USED BY ENGLISHMEN IN MANY YEARS AFTER 1565 THERE IS THE REMARK BY WILLIAM HARRISON IN HIS CHRONOLOGIE 1588 THAT IN 1573 THE TAKING IN OF THE SMOKE OF THE INDIAN HERBE CALLED TOBACCO BY AN INSTRUMENT FORMED LIKE A LITTLE LADELL WHEREBY IT PASSETH FROM THE MOUTH INTO THE HEAD AND STOMACH IS GRETLIE TAKEN UP AND USED IN ENGLAND THE LITTLE LADELL DESCRIBES THE EARLY
THE FEMININE SMOKING-JACKET OF TO-DAY IS WORN WITH ENTRANCING LITTLE EVENING OR SEMI-EVENING FROCKS AND REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN A CLOAK AND A COAT BEING EXQUISITELY DRAPED AND FASHIONED OF THE SOFTEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE OF THE SEASON'S BEAUTIFUL FABRICS THERE ARE STILL MANY GOOD PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO ARE SHOCKED AT THE IDEA OF WOMEN SMOKING
THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR A GALLANT WERE DESCRIBED BY ANOTHER WRITER IN 1603 AS TO MAKE GOOD FACES TO TAKE TOBACCO WELL TO SPIT WELL TO LAUGH LIKE A WAITING GENTLEWOMAN TO LIE WELL TO BLUSH FOR NOTHING TO LOOKE BIG UPON LITTLE FELLOWES TO SCOFFE WITH A GRACE
THE PIPE WAS OF WOOD CONSTRUCTED IN FOUR PIECES OF STRANGE SHAPE RUDELY CARVED WITH DOGS HEADS AND FACES OF RED INDIANS
HE APPLIED TO RUPERT SAYS MARKHAM FOR ORDERS AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF HIS OWN MOST NOBLE PERSON AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BATTLE THAT NIGHT AND THAT HE HAD BETTER GET INTO HIS COACH AND GO TO SLEEP WHICH HE ACCORDINGLY DID BUT THE DECISION AS TO BATTLE OR NO BATTLE DID NOT REST WITH PRINCE RUPERT
THEY HAVE BROKEN DOWN MANY BARRIERS AND IN MANY PLACES AND UNDER MANY AND DIVERS CONDITIONS THE PIPE HAS FOLLOWED TRIUMPHANTLY IN THEIR WAKE
AFTER A WHILE HE RANG THE BELL AND SAID I COULD DO THIS MUCH BETTER IF I HAD A PIPE THEREUPON PIPE AND TOBACCO WERE PROCURED AND TAKEN IN TO HIM
FOR WHICH WHAT CAN I SAY IN ANSWER
THE REAL DUKES AND SIR HARRYS TOOK SNUFF WITH A GRACE BUT THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING SO LOW AS TO SMOKE AND THEIR MENSERVANTS FAITHFULLY APED THEIR PREFERENCES AND THEIR AVERSIONS
AND IF HE GIVES CONTENT THEN TO HAVE L8
THE MENSERVANTS--THE DUKES AND SIR HARRYS--OFFER ONE ANOTHER SNUFF
IN THE RULES OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AT CHIGWELL ESSEX WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN 1629 IT IS PRESCRIBED THAT THE MASTER MUST BE A MAN OF SOUND RELIGION NEITHER A PAPIST NOR A PURITAN OF A GRAVE BEHAVIOUR AND SOBER AND HONEST CONVERSATION NO TIPPLER OR HAUNTER OF ALEHOUSES NO PUFFER OF TOBACCO A WORTHY DERBYSHIRE MAN NAMED CAMPBELL IN HIS WILL DATED 20 OCTOBER 1616 LEFT ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD GOODS TO HIS SON ON THIS CONDITION THAT YF AT ANY TIME HEREAFTER ANY OF HIS BROTHERS OR SISTERS SHALL FYND HIM TAKEING OF TOBACCO THAT THEN HE OR SHE SO FYNDING HIM SHALL HAVE THE SAID GOODS"--A TESTAMENTARY ARRANGEMENT WHICH SUGGESTS TO THE FANCY SOME AMUSING STRATEGIC EVASIONS AND MANOEUVRES ON THE PART OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGATEE AND HIS WATCHFUL RELATIONS
HERE IS FITZ-BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT--"WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
THE POORE SORT OF INHABITANTS VIZT
IN A LIST OF SEA STORES PUT ON BOARD A VESSEL CALLED BY THE UN-QUAKER-LIKE NAME OF THE CHARMING POLLY WHICH BROUGHT A PARTY OF FRIENDS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC FROM PHILADELPHIA IN 1756 WE FIND IN SAMUEL FOTHERGILL'S NEW CHEST
PARR IS SAID ON ONE OCCASION TO HAVE CALLED FOR A PIPE AFTER TAKING A MEAL AT A COACHING-INN CALLED THE BUSH AT BRISTOL WHEN THE WAITER TOLD HIM THAT SMOKING WAS NOT ALLOWED AT THE BUSH
THE BEAUX OF THE TIME DID NOT SMOKE
IN FIELDING'S AMELIA A WOMAN OF THE LOWEST CHARACTER IS SPOKEN OF AS SMOKING TOBACCO DRINKING PUNCH TALKING OBSCENELY AND SWEARING AND CURSING"--WHICH ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE ALL CAREFULLY NOTED BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO THE ORDINARY RESPECTABLE FEMALE
BUT THE STORY SHOWS THE PREJUDICE AGAINST SMOKING WHICH WAS FOUND IN MANY PLACES AS A RESULT OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD TOWARDS TOBACCO
10D IN THOSE OF ST ALPHEGE LONDON WALL FOR 1671 THERE ARE THE ENTRIES--"FOR PIPES AND TOBACCOE IN THE VESTRY 2S AND FOR A GROSSE OF PIPES AT SEVERALL TIMES 2S IN THE NEXT CENTURY HOWEVER THE PRACTICE WAS MODIFIED
WELL HE WAS A VERY SING'LAR MARN WAS MASS PILBEAM A VERY SING'LAR MARN
IT WAS BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THAT AN ATTIC STORY WAS ADDED TO THE BUILDING AND SMOKERS CAN NOW REACH MORE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS BY MEANS OF A LIFT PUT IN WHEN THE ALTERATIONS WERE MADE IN 1900
IN BEN JONSON'S EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR FOR INSTANCE WHICH WAS FIRST ACTED IN 1598 SIX YEARS BEFORE KING JAMES BLEW HIS ROYAL COUNTER-BLASTE COB THE WATER-BEARER SAYS THAT HE WOULD HAVE ANY MAN OR WOMAN THAT SHOULD BUT DEAL WITH A TOBACCO-PIPE IMMEDIATELY WHIPPED
A BET WAS MADE BY ONE UNDERGRADUATE AND TAKEN BY ANOTHER THAT AT WHATEVER TIME HOWEVER EARLY THE DEAN MIGHT BE VISITED IN HIS OWN DEN HE WOULD BE FOUND SMOKING
A CONTEMPORARY PAINTING OF A GROUP OF PURITAN DIVINES OVER THE MANTELPIECE OF PARSON LOWELL OF NEWBURY SHOWS THEM WELL PROVIDED WITH PUNCH-BOWL AND DRINKING-CUPS TOBACCO AND PIPES
WEDNESDAY
THEIR DRINKING AND RAKING ONLY MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE OLD MAIDS
A CONTEMPORARY PAMPHLETEER SAYS THAT IN THE SHOW OF THAT YEAR WERE TWO EXTREME GREAT GIANTS EACH OF THEM AT LEAST 15 FOOT HIGH THAT DO SIT AND ARE DRAWN BY HORSES IN TWO SEVERAL CHARIOTS MOVING TALKING AND TAKING TOBACCO AS THEY RIDE ALONG TO THE GREAT ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT OF ALL THE SPECTATORS AMONG THE GUESTS AT A WEDDING IN LONDON IN 1683 WERE THE LORD MAYOR SHERIFF AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE--THE AFTERWARDS NOTORIOUS JEFFREYS--AND OTHER BIGWIGS EVELYN RECORDS WITH GRAVE DISAPPROVAL THAT THESE GREAT MEN SPENT THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON TILL 11 AT NIGHT IN DRINKING HEALTHS TAKING TOBACCO AND TALKING MUCH BENEATH THE GRAVITY OF JUDGES WHO HAD BUT A DAY OR TWO BEFORE CONDEMNED MR ALGERNON SIDNEY ALTHOUGH SMOKING WAS GENERAL AMONG PARSONS YET ATTACKS ON TOBACCO WERE OCCASIONALLY HEARD FROM PULPITS

WHEN CALM AROUND THE COMMON ROOM I PUFF'D MY DAILY PIPE'S PERFUME
THIS INDIAN WEED IS GOOD INDEED PUFF ON KEEP UP THE JOKE TIS THE BEST TWILL STAND THE TEST EITHER TO CHEW OR SMOKE THE BILL BEARING THIS SIGN IS IN BANKS'S COLLECTION 1750
THESE PIPES HAVE BEEN DUG UP FROM TIME TO TIME IN NUMBERS SO LARGE THAT ONE ANTIQUARY MR H
WAS PAID FOR BUTTER CHEESE BREAD CAKES BEERE AND TOBACCO AND TOBACCO PIPES AT THE GOEING OF THE ROUNDS OF THE TOWNE ON THE OCCASION OF A SIMILAR PERAMBULATION OF THE PARISH BOUNDARIES IN 1714-15 THE CHURCHWARDENS PAID FOR BEER PIPES AND TOBACCO CAKES AND WINE
IT IS A GREAT SOOTHER A PLEASANT COMFORTER
IT WILL MAKE ONE REST THAT WANTS SLEEP AND WILL KEEP ONE WAKING THAT IS DROWSIE
ROSSETTI TOLD ON THE AUTHORITY OF WOOLNER HOW IN THE COURSE OF A TRIP WITH FRIENDS TO ITALY TOBACCO SUCH AS TENNYSON COULD SMOKE GAVE OUT AT SOME PARTICULAR CITY WHEREUPON THE POET PACKED UP HIS PORTMANTEAU AND RETURNED HOME BREAKING UP THE PARTY
SOME THEREIN WERE SLEEPING OTHERS SWEARING OTHERS SMOAKING TOBACCO
THIS SECESSION MUST HAVE BEEN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT OF THE BISHOPS OF WHOM AT ONE TIME MANY WERE MEMBERS BUT WHO LEFT IT IS SAID BECAUSE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILLIARD-TABLE
IN ONE OR TWO A HANDLE TERMINATES IN A HOOK BY WHICH THEY COULD BE HUNG UP WHEN NOT REQUIRED FOR USE
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE HIM A GLASS OF ABSINTHE
RULE II WAS EVERY MEMBER SHALL FILL HIS PIPE OUT OF HIS OWN BOX
ONE OF THE AIRS WILL SUFFICE AS A SAMPLE
THIS WAS IN THE OCCUPATION OF SIR WALTER FOR TWENTY YEARS 1583-1603 AND HE WAS PROBABLY RESIDENT THERE WHEN HARIOT RETURNED FROM VIRGINIA TO MAKE HIS REPORT AND INSTRUCT HIS EMPLOYER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A PIPE
THERE IS A COPY OF THE BILL IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND IN THE CATALOGUE OF THE PRINTS AND DRAWINGS IN THE NATIONAL COLLECTION MR STEPHENS THUS DESCRIBES IT
IT RAN THUS
THE FAMILIAR PLATE OF A MODERN MIDNIGHT CONVERSATION SHOWS A PARSON IN SURPLICE AND WIG SMOKING LIKE A FURNACE WHILE HE LADLES PUNCH FROM A BOWL--PROBABLY MEANT FOR A PORTRAIT OF THE NOTORIOUS ORATOR HENLEY
IN 1752 IT WAS NOTED THAT A SERMON HAD BEEN PREACHED AFTER A FUNERAL TO A NOISY CONGREGATION ON ANOTHER OCCASION SAYS THE REGISTER THE RINGERS AND OTHER INHABITANTS DISTURBED THE SERVICE FROM THE BEGINNING OF PRAYERS TO THE END OF THE SERMON BY RINGING THE BELLS AND GOING INTO THE GALLERY TO SPIT BELOW
A FEW HOURS LATER WHEN THE PARSON FANNY AND THEIR GUIDE ARE DRIVEN BY A STORM OF RAIN TO TAKE SHELTER IN A WAYSIDE ALE-HOUSE ADAMS IMMEDIATELY PROCURED HIMSELF A GOOD FIRE A TOAST AND ALE AND A PIPE AND BEGAN TO SMOKE WITH GREAT CONTENT UTTERLY FORGETTING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE SAME INN AFTER MRS SLIPSLOP HAS APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED ADAMS SMOKES THREE PIPES AND TAKES A COMFORTABLE NAP IN A GREAT CHAIR SO LEAVING THE LOVERS JOSEPH AND FANNY TO ENJOY A DELIGHTFUL TIME TOGETHER
FORM OF THE TOBACCO-PIPE WITH SMALL AND VERY SHALLOW BOWL
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO IMAGINABLE REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SMOKED OPENLY
AND TO THEM MAY BE COMMENDED THE COMMON-SENSE WORDS OF BISHOP BOYD-CARPENTER FORMERLY OF RIPON WHO ARRIVED IN NEW YORK EARLY IN 1913 TO DELIVER A SERIES OF LECTURES AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY
SMOKING IN THE DINING-ROOM AFTER DINNER IS NOW SO GENERAL THAT PEOPLE ARE APT TO FORGET THAT THIS PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT IS OF NO GREAT AGE
BARRY'S ORIGINAL PLAN FOR THE TRAVELLERS CLUB ERECTED IN 1832 SHOWS NO SMOKING-ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR
SHIFT A PROFESSOR OF THE ART IN JONSON'S PLAY PUTS UP A BILL IN ST PAUL'S--THE RECOGNIZED CENTRE FOR ADVERTISEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OF EVERY KIND--IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO TEACH ANY YOUNG GENTLEMAN NEWLY COME INTO HIS INHERITANCE WHO WISHES TO BE AS EXACTLY QUALIFIED AS THE BEST OF THE ORDINARY-HUNTING GALLANTS ARE--"TO ENTERTAIN THE MOST GENTLEMANLIKE USE OF TOBACCO
HE SMOKED TOO MUCH--REGRETTED IT--BUT CONTINUED TO SMOKE NOT WISELY BUT TOO WELL
MISSON THE WOMEN OF DEVON AND CORNWALL MIGHT WONDER WHY THE WOMEN OF MIDDLESEX DID NOT TAKE TOBACCO IT IS CERTAIN THAT LONDON AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD DID CONTAIN AT LEAST A FEW FEMALE SMOKERS
NOR HAS THE PRACTICE BY ANY MEANS YET DIED OUT
I FOR MY PART DO NOT DESPAIR TO SEE A BISHOP LOLLING OUT OF THE ATHENAEUM WITH A CHEROOT IN HIS MOUTH OR AT ANY RATE A PIPE STUCK IN HIS SHOVEL-HAT THE FLIGHT OF FANCY IN THE LAST SENTENCE HAS HARDLY YET BEEN FULFILLED
IN THIS PRODUCTION RICH DECLARES THAT EVERY FELLOW WHO CAME INTO AN ALE-HOUSE AND CALLED FOR HIS POT MUST HAVE HIS PIPE ALSO FOR TOBACCO WAS THEN A COMMODITY AS MUCH SOLD IN EVERY TAVERN INN AND ALE-HOUSE AS WINE ALE OR BEER
TOBACCO SAVE IN THE DISGUISE OF SNUFF WAS TABOOED
WON'T YOU CATCH IT WHEN MA COMES HOME FOR MAKING THE CURTAINS SMELL ANOTHER WITNESS TO THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF CIGAR-SMOKING IS CAPTAIN GRONOW THE AUTHOR OF THE WELL-KNOWN REMINISCENCES GRONOW SAYS THAT THE FAMOUS SURGEON SIR ASTLEY COOPER ON ONE OCCASION PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS FOND OF SMOKING CAUTIONED HIM AGAINST THAT HABIT TELLING HIM THAT IT WOULD SOONER OR LATER BE THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH
MORNING IS A GIRL AND CAN'T SMOKE--SHE'S NO EVIDENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
SO THERE ARE MANY TASTES IN PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY TOBACCO IS SAID TO HAVE INVADED EVEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ITSELF
OF COURSE WHAT ONE MIGHT DO IN THE COUNTRY AND WHAT ONE MIGHT DO IN TOWN WERE TWO QUITE DIFFERENT THINGS
THIS IS RIGHT AND INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH
BUT WHETHER SIR WALTER HAD ANY AUTHORITY IN FACT FOR THIS CHARACTERISTIC PERFORMANCE OF KNOCKDUNDER OR NOT IT IS CERTAIN THAT ANY SUCH OCCURRENCE IN A SCOTTISH KIRK MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RARE
MR A.D
SOME OF THE APOTHECARIES WHOSE SHOPS WERE IN MOST REPUTE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE TOBACCO KEPT TOOK PUPILS AND TAUGHT THEM THE SLIGHTS AS TRICKS WITH THE PIPE WERE CALLED
AND IT IS SIGNIFICANT OF HOW SMOKING OUT OF DOORS WAS THEN REGARDED THAT DICKENS GOING ON TO DESCRIBE SAWYER IN DETAIL REFERS TO THAT SORT OF SLOVENLY SMARTNESS AND SWAGGERING GAIT WHICH IS PECULIAR TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHO SMOKE IN THE STREETS BY DAY SHOUT AND SCREAM IN THE SAME BY NIGHT CALL WAITERS BY THEIR CHRISTIAN NAMES AND DO VARIOUS OTHER ACTS AND DEEDS OF AN EQUALLY FACETIOUS DESCRIPTION APPARENTLY IN 1836 THE ONLY PERSON WHO WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SEEN SMOKING IN THE STREET WAS OF THE KIND NATURALLY INCLINED TO DO THE OTHER OBJECTIONABLE THINGS MENTIONED
HAD YOU IT IN THE HOUSE
IT IS TERSER AND MORE TO THE POINT THAN MOST PANEGYRICS
THE MARQ
ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON CHID RALPH FOR MISLAYING MY TOBACCO-BOX
AND THAT PIPES AND TOBACCO BE NOT ALLOWED
CHURCHMAN INFORMS ME THAT IT BELONGED TO HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ESTABLISHED THE BUSINESS IN IPSWICH IN 1790 AND HE BELIEVED IT WAS QUITE A HUNDRED YEAR OLD AT THAT TIME ONE OF THE EARLIEST KNOWN EXAMPLES OF THESE HIGHLANDERS AS TOBACCONISTS SIGNS IS THAT WHICH WAS PLACED AT THE DOOR OF A SHOP IN COVENTRY STREET WHICH WAS OPENED IN 1720 UNDER THE SIGN OF THE HIGHLANDER THISTLE AND CROWN THIS IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A FAVOURITE PLACE OF RESORT OF THE JACOBITES
TOBACCO-SMOKING WAS ADVANCING VICTORIOUSLY ALL ALONG THE LINE
I HAVE LIGHTED MY PIPE MORE THAN ONCE WITH THE WRITINGS OF A PRELATE ADDISON AND STEELE SMOKED AND SO DID PRIOR WHO SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A WEAKNESS AT TIMES FOR LOW COMPANY
A VERY THIN LINE THUS SEPARATES THE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER ITSELF FROM THE CONQUERING WEED
PRESENTLY HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HISSING AND WHEN GARRICK CAME IN AND EXPLAINED THAT THE AUDIENCE HAD HISSED THE SCENE HE HAD WISHED TO HAVE MODIFIED ALL FIELDING SAID WAS
AS FIRST TO GIVE IT THE MOST EXQUISITE PERFUME
6D SPRIGS OF JUNIPER PITCH AND SWEETE WOOD IN COMBINATION WITH INCENSE WERE OFTEN USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
I HAVE A VERY NEAT LITTLE GENUINE SPECIMEN OF THE OLD TOBACCONIST'S SIGN OF A 42ND HIGHLANDER WITH HIS MULL IT IS 3 FT
IN PUCK 1870 OUIDA REPRESENTED ONE OF HER BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MEN VY BRUCE AS MURMURING IDLEST NONSENSE TO LILIAN LEE AS HE LIGHTED ONE OF HIS CIGARETTES FOR HER USE"--BUT LILIAN LEE WAS A COCOTTE
MET MR NISBY THERE
ANGELO GIVES SOME LIVELY PICTURES OF SCENES OF THIS KIND IN THE LONDON OF ABOUT 1780
YES A PLEASANT PLACE ENOUGH RETURNED THE ENGLISHMAN
IN THE NOW VACANT KITCHEN EVEN SO LATE AS 1861 THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING WAS STILL MUCH THE SAME IN SOME QUARTERS
IT HAS OFTEN BEEN STATED THAT CAPTAIN WILLIAM MIDDLETON OR MYDDELTON SON OF RICHARD MIDDLETON GOVERNOR OF DENBIGH CASTLE A CAPTAIN PRICE AND A CAPTAIN KOET WERE THE FIRST WHO SMOKED PUBLICLY IN LONDON AND THAT FOLK FLOCKED FROM ALL PARTS TO SEE THEM
WHILE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX WAS A REPRESENTATION OF OLIVER CROMWELL LEANING AGAINST A POST A GALLOWS-TREE OVER HIS HEAD AND ABOUT HIS NECK A HALTER TIED TO THE TREE WHILE BESIDE HIM WAS PICTURED THE DEVIL WIDE-MOUTHED

THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT TOBACCO WHICH MAKES A MAN BEAT HIS WIFE OR ASSAULT HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW--RATHER THE REVERSE IN FACT FOR TOBACCO IS A SOOTHER AND A QUIETENER OF THE PASSIONS AND MANY A MAN I DARESAY HAS BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING RASH THINGS IN THE WAY OF RETALIATION WHEN HE HAS LIT HIS PIPE AND HAD A GOOD THINK OVER HIS AFFAIRS

TOBACCO TRIUMPHANT
IF TABACCO HE SAYS WERE USED PHYSICALLY AND WITH DISCRETION THERE WERE NO MEDICAMENT IN THE WORLDE COMPARABLE TO IT
MAYBE THE TRUTH IS THAT ONE PIPE IS WHOLESOME TWO PIPES TOOTHSOME THREE PIPES NOISOME FOUR PIPES FULSOME FIVE PIPES QUARRELSOME AND THAT'S THE SUM ON'T
SIGNS OF REVIVAL 137 X
THE TRUTH PROBABLY IS THAT WHOEVER ACTUALLY SMOKED THE FIRST PIPE IT WAS RALEIGH WHO BROUGHT THE PRACTICE INTO COMMON USE
AS ALSO THE RARE COROLLARY AND PRACTICE OF THE CUBAN EBOLITION EURIPUS AND WHIFF WHICH HE SHALL RECEIVE OR TAKE IN HERE AT LONDON AND EVAPORATE AT UXBRIDGE OR FARTHER IF IT PLEASE HIM TAKING THE WHIFF IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER A SWALLOWING OF THE SMOKE OR A RETAINING IT IN THE THROAT FOR A GIVEN SPACE OF TIME

THE SUGAR LOAF WAS THE PRINCIPAL GROCER'S SIGN AND SO WHEN IT IS FOUND IN COMBINATION WITH THE TOBACCO ROLL AT THIS TIME IT MAY REASONABLY BE ASSUMED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THE BUSINESS WAS A GROCER WHO WAS ALSO A TOBACCONIST
YET I CANNOT ACCOUNT WHY A THING WHICH REQUIRES SO LITTLE EXERTION AND YET PRESERVES THE MIND FROM TOTAL VACUITY SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT JOHNSON DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF TO THINK OF HOW MUCH THE VAGARIES OF FASHION ACCOUNT FOR STRANGER VICISSITUDES IN MANNERS AND CUSTOMS THAN THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SMOKING-HABIT
WHOSE PERSONALITY COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO HIM UTTERED THE REMARKABLE WISH THAT THE LAST BREATH HE DREW IN MIGHT BE THROUGH A PIPE AND EXHALED IN A PUN
EVEN IN OUR OWN DAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OBSERVED SMOKING--NOT DURING SERVICE TIME BUT IN PASSING THROUGH THE BUILDING--IN CHURCH IN SOME OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN STATES AND NEARER HOME IN HOLLAND
IT HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THAT THE ELIZABETHAN GALLANT WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE MOST FASHIONABLE METHODS OF INHALING AND EXHALING THE SMOKE OF TOBACCO

THEY HAVE PIPES ON PURPOSE MADE OF CLAY INTO THE FURTHER END OF WHICH THEY PUT THE HERB SO DRY THAT IT MAY BE RUBBED INTO POWDER
KING JAMES I IN HIS FAMOUS COUNTER-BLASTE TO TOBACCO HINTED THAT THE HUSBAND BY HIS INDULGENCE IN THE HABIT MIGHT REDUCE THEREBY HIS DELICATE WHOLESOME AND CLEANE COMPLEXIONED WIFE TO THAT EXTREMITIE THAT EITHER SHEE MUST ALSO CORRUPT HER SWEETE BREATH THEREWITH OR ELSE RESOLVE TO LIVE IN A PERPETUALL STINKING TORMENT HIS MAJESTY'S STYLE WAS FORCIBLE IF NOT ELEGANT
I THINK YOU CAN GO APART FROM CIGARETTE-SMOKING HOWEVER THE USE OF TOBACCO GREW STEADILY DURING THE LATER VICTORIAN PERIOD
PENALTIES FOR OFFENCES OF THIS FANCIFUL KIND WERE NOT COMMON IN ENGLAND
FOR MY BOX
AND IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL INDEED WHETHER A SINGLE PARSON PUT HIS PIPE OUT

ANOTHER ELIZABETHAN WHO IS OFTEN SAID TO HAVE SMOKED THE FIRST PIPE IN ENGLAND IS RALPH LANE THE FIRST GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WHO CAME HOME WITH DRAKE IN 1586

WALTER THORNBURY IN HIS HAUNTED LONDON REFERRING TO THE STORY OF THE SERVANT THROWING THE ALE OVER HIS SMOKING MASTER SAYS
BUT AFTER DUE ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN MADE FOR A FEW MINOR RESTRICTIONS OF THIS KIND THE FACT REMAINS THAT SMOKING HAS TRIUMPHED SOCIALLY ALL ALONG THE LINE IN CLUBLAND
HE'S NO GOOD-FELLOW THAT'S WITHOUT
SINCE THE EARLY DECADES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SMOKING HAS NEVER BEEN SO GENERALLY PRACTISED NOR SO SMILED UPON BY FASHION AS IT IS AT THE PRESENT TIME
IN 1832 WE HEAR OF TENNYSON BEING IN LONDON WITH HIM AND SMOKING ALL THE DAY LADY RITCHIE IN TENNYSON AND HIS FRIENDS SAYS
AT A SMOKING CONCERT WHERE FEW PIPES ARE SMOKED ANYONE LOOKING ATHWART THE SMOKE OF BURNING WEEDS CAN AT ONCE REALIZE HOW MUCH GREATER IS THE VOLUME OF SMOKE FROM CIGARS AND CIGARETTES THAN WOULD RESULT FROM THE SMOKING OF A LIKE NUMBER OF PIPES
AT THE MEETINGS OF THE APOSTLES"--THE LITTLE GROUP OF FRIENDS WHICH INCLUDED THE FUTURE LAUREATE--"MUCH COFFEE WAS DRUNK MUCH TOBACCO SMOKED DONS SMOKED AS WELL AS UNDERGRADUATES

BUT IN THE NEXT YEAR THEY AGAIN FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COME TO PARLIAMENT SHOWING THE GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR TRADE SINCE THEIR INCORPORATION 17 JAMES I AND THEIR THREATENED RUIN BECAUSE COOKS BAKERS AND ALE-HOUSE KEEPERS AND OTHERS MAKE PIPES BUT SO UNSKILFULLY THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO DISESTEEM
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY A COMMON DEVICE WAS THREE FIGURES REPRESENTING A DUTCHMAN A SCOTCHMAN AND A SAILOR EXPLAINED BY THE ACCOMPANYING RHYME
THE TOBACCO ROLL EITHER ALONE OR IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS WAS ONE OF THE COMMONEST OF EARLY TOBACCONISTS SIGNS AND WAS IN CONSTANT USE FOR A COUPLE OF CENTURIES

DR BURNEY WHEN A SCHOOLBOY AT CHESTER WAS EXTREMELY CURIOUS TO SEE SO EXTRAORDINARY A MAN SO WHEN HANDEL WENT THROUGH THAT CITY IN 1741 ON HIS WAY TO IRELAND YOUNG BURNEY WATCHED HIM NARROWLY AS LONG AS HE REMAINED IN CHESTER AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HAD THE FELICITY OF SEEING THE GREAT MAN SMOKE A PIPE OVER A DISH OF COFFEE AT THE EXCHANGE COFFEE-HOUSE WHICH WAS UNDER THE OLD TOWN HALL THAT STOOD OPPOSITE THE PRESENT KING'S SCHOOL AND IN FRONT OF THE PRESENT TOWN HALL
AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE CENTURY AND IN QUEEN ANNE'S TIME THE TENDENCY WAS FOR TOBACCO TO GO OUT OF FASHION
IN THE 1631 EDITION OF STOW'S CHRONICLES IT IS STATED THAT TOBACCO WAS FIRST BROUGHT AND MADE KNOWN BY SIR JOHN HAWKINS ABOUT THE YEAR 1565 BUT NOT USED BY ENGLISHMEN IN MANY YEARS AFTER THERE IS ONLY ONE REFERENCE TO TOBACCO IN HAWKINS'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS TRAVELS
NOW MRS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
AN AMERICAN TOURIST BEGAN TALKING ONE DAY TO A QUIET-LOOKING MAN WHO WAS SMOKING OUTSIDE AN INN ON THE CHATSWORTH ESTATE AND TAKING THE MAN FOR THE INN-KEEPER EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION OF THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE'S DOMAIN
HE TELLS US THAT A MAN COULD NOT HEARTILY WELCOME HIS FRIEND WITHOUT AT ONCE PROPOSING A SMOKE
THERE IS NO OTHER REFERENCE TO TOBACCO FOR HER IN THE JOURNAL AND ACCOUNT BOOK
IT REQUIRES NO EFFORT OF THE FANCY TO PICTURE THESE THREE MEN SHAKESPEARE BACON AND RALEIGH AS LOUNGING IN A WINDOW OF DURHAM HOUSE PUFFING THE NEW INDIAN WEED FROM SILVER BOWLS DISCUSSING THE HIGHEST THEMES IN POETRY AND SCIENCE WHILE GAZING ON THE FLOWER-BEDS AND THE RIVER THE DARTING BARGES OF DAME AND CAVALIER AND THE DISTANT PAVILIONS OF PARIS GARDEN AND THE GLOBE THIS IS A PURE EFFORT OF THE FANCY SO FAR AS BACON AND SHAKESPEARE ARE CONCERNED
THE TASTE FOR SMOKING HOWEVER HAS REVIVED PROBABLY FROM THE MILITARY HABITS OF EUROPE DURING THE FRENCH WARS
A LB IN 1829 HAD ITS EFFECT IN MAKING CIGARS MORE POPULAR
I WONDER IF I COULD GET A LOOK AT THE OLD CHAP SAID THE STRANGER AFTER A SHORT SILENCE
TENNYSON AND HIS FRIENDS SMOKED THEIR PIPES AS THEY HAD ALWAYS DONE--AND OLD-FASHIONED CLAY PIPES TOO
BUT THEY WERE A VALUABLE DISCOVERY AND THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S FRIENDS BOUGHT THEM EAGERLY AT EIGHTEENPENCE APIECE THIS EXPERIMENT IN THE DIRECTION OF WOODEN PIPES WAS INTERESTING AND DESERVES TO BE REMEMBERED
AT THE QUARTERLY MEETING OF ABERDEEN FRIENDS IN 1692 A WEIGHTY PAPER CONTAINING SEVERAL HEADS OF SOLID ADVYCES AND COUNSELLS TO FRIENDS SENT BY IRISH QUAKERS WAS READ
THIS MAN CONCEIVED AND WROUGHT OUT THE IDEA OF MAKING PIPES OF WILLOW-WOOD CUTTING THE BOWL OUT OF A THICK STEM AND THE TUBE OUT OF A THINNER ONE GROWING FROM THE BOWL SO THAT THE WHOLE PIPE WAS IN ONE PIECE
AND HOWEVER LITTLE ENTHUSIASM THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AT OXFORD IN THOSE DAYS FOR LEARNING AND STUDY THERE WAS PLENTY OF LIFE IN POLITICAL ANIMOSITIES
THE GREATEST OF CLERICAL TOBACCONISTS OF LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY DATE WAS THE ONCE FAMOUS DR PARR
I SHOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I AM INDEBTED TO MR VERNON RENDALL EDITOR OF THE ATHENAEUM FOR A NUMBER OF VALUABLE REFERENCES AND SUGGESTIONS
AND SIMILAR EXPENDITURE WAS COMMON AMONG BOTH LONDON AND PROVINCIAL COMPANIES
AND MANY OLD TOBACCO PAPERS SHOW A BLACK BOY OR SOMETIMES TWO SMOKING
SOME SO-CALLED DRUGGISTS IT MAY BE SHREWDLY SUSPECTED DID MUCH MORE BUSINESS IN TOBACCO THAN THEY DID IN DRUGS
WHY SHOULD IT BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF VULGARITY OF PLEBEIANISM TO INHALE TOBACCO-SMOKE THROUGH THE STEM OF A BRIAR AND THE HALL-MARK OF GOOD BREEDING TO FINGER A CIGAR OR DALLY WITH THAT TRIVIALITY AND TRAVESTY OF THE ADORATION OF MY LADY NICOTINE--A CIGARETTE TO THESE QUESTIONS THERE CAN BE BUT ONE ANSWER
IN 1651 THE CHESTER COMPANY OF BARBERS SURGEONS WAX AND TALLOW CHANDLERS--A REMARKABLY COMPREHENSIVE ORGANIZATION--PAID FOR SACK BEERE AND TOBACCO AT THE TALBOT ON ST LUKE'S DAY OCTOBER 18 ON THE OCCASION OF A DINNER GIVEN TO THE COMPANY BY ONE RICHARD WALKER
THEN CAME SMOKE
THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM THE FEAR OF THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO-SMOKE WAS EXTRAORDINARY
WHICH FROM EAST TO WEST CHEERS THE TAR'S LABOURS OR THE TURKMAN'S REST
COUNTRY-FOLK NOWADAYS OFTEN LIGHT THEIR PIPES IN THE OLD WAY BY PICKING UP A LIVE COAL OR IN IRELAND A FRAGMENT OF GLOWING PEAT FROM THE KITCHEN FIRE WITH THE ORDINARY TONGS AND APPLYING IT TO THE PIPE-BOWL
FOR A LONG TIME IT HAD BEEN CONFINED IN THIS COUNTRY TO THE RICHER CLASS OF SMOKERS BUT WHEN HE WROTE IT WAS IN UNIVERSAL USE THE WONDER IS THAT WITH SO MANY MEN SMOKING CIGARS THE OLD DOMESTIC AND CLUB RESTRICTIONS AS PILLORIED IN THACKERAY'S PAGES WERE MAINTAINED SO LONG
JOHN NEWTON MAY 28 1782 SMOKING HAS GONE OUT SAID JOHNSON IN TALK AT ST ANDREWS ONE DAY IN 1773
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HABIT MADE SMOKING UNFASHIONABLE
THE ACCOUNT OF HOW THE BLIND POET PASSED HIS DAYS AFTER HIS RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC OFFICE WAS FIRST TOLD BY HIS CONTEMPORARY RICHARDSON AND HAS SINCE BEEN REPEATED BY ALL HIS BIOGRAPHERS
HOGARTH'S SUBSCRIPTION TICKET FOR THE PRINT OF SIGISMUNDA WAS TIME SMOKING A PICTURE 1761 IT REPRESENTS AN OLD MAN SITTING ON A FRAGMENT OF STATUARY AND SMOKING A LONG PIPE AGAINST A PICTURE OF A LANDSCAPE WHICH STANDS UPON AN EASEL BEFORE HIM
I GENERALLY AM EATING MY DINNER ABOUT THE TIME I SHOULD DETERMINE IT
THE MOST FASHIONABLE LOUNGE YOU HAVE BUT IT IS A REPUBLIC FOR ALL THAT THERE SHE SAYS COULD BILL JACOBS LEAN AGAINST A RAIL WITH A CLAY-PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND A TERRIER UNDER HIS ARM CLOSE BESIDE THE EARL OF GUILLIADENE WITH HIS CIGARETTE AND HIS EYE-GLASS AND HIS POOLE-CUT HABILIMENTS THIRTY YEARS OR MORE AGO THE LATE ANDREW LANG WROTE AN ARTICLE ENTITLED ENCHANTED CIGARETTES WHICH BEGAN--"TO DREAM OUR LITERARY PROJECTS BALZAC SAYS IS LIKE SMOKING ENCHANTED CIGARETTES BUT WHEN WE TRY TO TACKLE OUR PROJECTS TO MAKE THEM REAL THE ENCHANTMENT DISAPPEARS--WE HAVE TO TILL THE SOIL TO SOW THE WEED TO GATHER THE LEAVES AND THEN THE CIGARETTES MUST BE MANUFACTURED WHILE THERE MAY BE NO MARKET FOR THEM AFTER ALL
MADAM THO THE ILL-NATUR'D WORLD CENSURES YOU FOR SMOAKING BROWN ADVISED HER TO CONTINUE THE INNOCENT DIVERSION BECAUSE FIRST IT WAS GOOD FOR THE TOOTHACHE THE CONSTANT PERSECUTOR OF OLD LADIES AND SECONDLY IT WAS A GREAT HELP TO MEDITATION WHICH IS THE REASON I SUPPOSE HE CONTINUES THAT RECOMMENDS IT TO YOUR PARSONS
HE PROCEEDS TO CALCULATE WHAT THE ANNUAL EXPENDITURE ON SMOKE MUST BE

FROUDE IN ONE OF HIS SHORT STUDIES QUOTES A LEGEND TO THE EFFECT THAT RALEIGH SMOKED ON A ROCK BELOW THE MANOR HOUSE OF GREENAWAY ON THE RIVER DART WHICH WAS THE HOME OF THE FIRST HUSBAND OF KATHERINE CHAMPERNOWNE AFTERWARDS RALEIGH'S WIFE
AND I HAD HIS STEEL BOX WITH THE BARGAIN AND FULL OF SMOAKE APPARENTLY MR HILL'S SECRETARIAL LABOURS WERE VALUED AT 20S
SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY AS A TYPICAL COUNTRY SQUIRE WAS NATURALLY A SMOKER
SMOKING IN CHURCH 225 XV
ONE OF THESE WAS THE POET CAMPBELL
WHENEVER ANYBODY COUNTERBLASTS TO-DAY AGAINST TOBACCO I FEEL AS DID MY OLD FRIEND WILKIE COLLINS WHEN SOMEBODY TOLD HIM THAT TO SMOKE WAS A WRONG THING
MUNBY POINTED OUT THAT SMOLLETT IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS DATED MARCH 18 1765 GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS JOURNEY FROM NICE TO TURIN DESCRIBES HOW HE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN BROVIS AND ON THE TOP THEREOF MET A QUIXOTIC FIGURE WHOM HE THUS PICTURES
NUMBER TWO TAKES A WHIFF OR TWO AND COURTEOUSLY SAYS
OF DR ALDRICH WHO WAS DEAN OF CHRIST CHURCH OXFORD AND WHO WROTE A CURIOUS CATCH NOT MORE DIFFICULT TO SING THAN DIVERTING TO HEAR TO BE SUNG BY FOUR MEN SMOAKING THEIR PIPES AN ANECDOTE HAS OFTEN BEEN RELATED WHICH ILLUSTRATES HIS DEVOTION TO THE WEED
FROM THE COURT TO THE COTTAGE FROM CHILDHOOD TO DOTAGE BOTH THOSE THAT ARE SICK AND THE HEALTHY
THE FIGURE WAS USUALLY MADE WITH A SNUFF MULL IN HIS HAND--THE HIGHLANDER BEING ALWAYS CREDITED WITH A GREAT LOVE AND A GREAT CAPACITY FOR SNUFF-TAKING
ONE MAN IS SMOKING FURIOUSLY WHILE ON THE TABLE LIE THREE OTHER PIPES--ONE FOR EACH MAN--AND SUNDRY POTS AND GLASSES
HE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT MOST SMOKERS REGARD AS THE BEST PIPE OF THE DAY--THE AFTER-BREAKFAST PIPE
IN DAYS WHEN THE NUMBERING OF HOUSES WAS UNKNOWN THE USE OF SIGNS WAS INDISPENSABLE FOR IDENTIFICATION
BUT SOME AT LEAST OF THESE FINDS WILL NOT BEAR THE INTERPRETATION WHICH HAS BEEN PUT UPON THEM AND IN OTHER CASES THE PRESENCE OF PIPES COULD REASONABLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR OTHERWISE THAN BY ASSOCIATING THEM WITH THE ANTIQUITY CLAIMED FOR THEM
IT IS SAID THAT THESE BLUE LAWS ARE NOT AUTHENTIC
THE ANECDOTE WHICH YOU MENTION WROTE THE MR DISNEY OF SWINDERBY IS I BELIEVE UNQUESTIONABLY TRUE
IN MAY 1913 A WOMAN WHO WAS CHARGED WITH DRUNKENNESS AT THE WEST HAM POLICE COURT LAID THE BLAME FOR HER CONDITION ON HER PIPE
A NIGGARD FOR HE WILL NOT PART WITH HIS BOX TO AN EMPEROR A CHARACTER IN ONE OF CHAPMAN'S PLAYS 1606 CALLS TOBACCO THE GENTLEMAN'S SAINT AND THE SOLDIER'S IDOL A LITTLE-KNOWN BARD OF 1630--BARTEN HOLIDAY--WROTE A POEM OF EIGHT STANZAS WITH CHORUS TO EACH IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO IN WHICH HE SHOWED WITH A TOUCH OF BURLESQUE THAT THE HERB WAS A MUSICIAN A LAWYER A PHYSICIAN A TRAVELLER A CRITIC AN IGNIS FATUUS AND A WHIFFLER I.E A BRAGGART
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PIPE-SMOKERS AMONG THE WOMEN OF THE POORER CLASSES
AMONG A HUNDRED OTHER THINGS TREATED WITH MINUTEST PARTICULARITY THE DESIRE IS EXPRESSED THAT ALL IDLE AND NEEDLESS SMOAKING OF TOBACCO BE FORBORN WILLIAM PENN DID NOT LIKE TOBACCO AND WAS OFTEN ANNOYED BY IT IN AMERICA
BUT IS NOT HE A FRUGAL MAN THAT ON A LEAF CAN DINE
APPARENTLY THE VULGAR BRANGHTONS WERE NOT VULGAR ENOUGH TO SMOKE
THE LATEST HISTORIAN OF LUTTERWORTH SAYS THAT THE GREAT PUFFS OF TOBACCO SMOKE WITH WHICH HE TENNYSON MELLOWED HIS THOUGHTS PROVED INSUFFERABLE TO HIS HOST AND HE WAS ACCORDINGLY TURNED OUT INTO MR ELMHIRST'S WORKSHOP IN THE GARDEN WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE BECAME THE BIRTHPLACE OF ONE OF THE GEMS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE ABOUT 1842 WHEN TENNYSON OFTEN DINED AT THE OLD COCK BY TEMPLE BAR AND AT OTHER TAVERNS THE PERFECT DINNER FOR HIS TASTE SAYS HIS SON WAS A BEEF-STEAK A POTATO A CUT OF CHEESE A PINT OF PORT AND AFTERWARDS A PIPE NEVER A CIGAR WHEN THE KINGSLEYS PAID THE TENNYSONS A VISIT ABOUT 1859 CHARLES KINGSLEY SO THE LAUREATE TOLD HIS SON TALKED AS USUAL ON ALL SORTS OF TOPICS AND WALKED HARD UP AND DOWN THE STUDY FOR HOURS SMOKING FURIOUSLY AND AFFIRMING THAT TOBACCO WAS THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT HIS NERVES QUIET THE LATE LAUREATE ALFRED AUSTIN ONCE ASKED TENNYSON AFTER READING A PASSAGE IN DOROTHY WORDSWORTH'S JOURNAL THAT WILLIAM HAD GONE TO BED
LITTLE WORK WAS DONE BUT MUCH TOBACCO WAS SMOKED
THIS OLD-FASHIONED HABIT MUST NOW BE PRETTY RARE THE CHIEF LEGITIMATE OBJECTION TO CIGARETTE SMOKING WAS WELL STATED SOME YEARS AGO BY THE LATE DR ANDREW WILSON
YET SO ENAMOURED OF THE NAME OF A GENTLEMAN THAT HE WILL HAVE IT THOUGH HE BUYS IT
EARLY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TOBACCO-SMOKING HAD REACHED ITS NADIR FROM THE SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW
HE SMOKED A LITTLE JACOBEAN CLAY PIPE IN HIS SKY-PARLOUR OVERLOOKING THE STRAND AND DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT THINK OR NOT THINK ABOUT THAT OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT
LOOK OVER THE WIDE WORLD HE SAYS TO THE LADIES AND SEE THAT YOUR ADVERSARY HAS OVERCOME IT
BUT WHAT WE WOULD SO WEAK IS MAN LIES OFT REMOTE FROM WHAT WE CAN HE DESCRIBES THE BOX AND ITS CONTENTS IN LINES WHICH SHOW NOT ONLY TOLERANCE BUT APPRECIATION OF TOBACCO FROM WHICH IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO INFER THAT COWPER'S FIRST VIEW OF HIS FRIEND'S SMOKING-HABIT AS A DRAWBACK--AS SHOWN IN HIS LETTER TO UNWIN QUOTED ABOVE--HAD BEEN MODIFIED BY NEIGHBOURHOOD AND CUSTOM
IN THE THIRD PLACE I WOULD ENJOIN EVERY SHOP TO MAKE USE OF A SIGN WHICH BEARS SOME AFFINITY TO THE WARES IN WHICH IT DEALS
THEY HAD FIRST SILVER PIPES
APPERSON
THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS CHAPTER INCLUDED BOTH THE CRIMEAN WAR AND THE INDIAN MUTINY AND EVERY ONE KNOWS HOW THE SOLDIERS IN THE CRIMEA AND IN INDIA ALIKE CRAVED FOR TOBACCO AS FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST OF LUXURIES AND HOW EVEN AN OCCASIONAL SMOKE CHEERED AND ENCOURAGED AND SUSTAINED SUFFERING HUMANITY
ABEL DRUGGER WAS A TOBACCO-MAN I.E A TOBACCO-SELLER IN BEN JONSON'S PLAY OF THE ALCHEMIST 1610 SO THAT IT IS NOT VERY SURPRISING TO FIND THE NAME USED OCCASIONALLY AS A TOBACCONIST'S SIGN
ONE OF THE LEARNED DOCTORS TOOK THE GERMAN VISITOR TO THE WEEKLY MEETING OF A MUSIC CLUB IN ONE OF THE COLLEGES
THE POET TOOK HIS FRUGAL SUPPER AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND AT NINE HAVING SMOKED A PIPE AND DRUNK A GLASS OF WATER HE WENT TO BED
BUTT
A FEW FOLK STILL CLING TO THIS SPELLING--THERE WAS A SEGAR-SHOP IN THE STRAND TILL QUITE RECENTLY AND I SAW THE NOTICE SEGARS THE OTHER DAY OVER A SMALL TOBACCO-SHOP IN YORK--WHICH HAS NO AUTHORITY AND ON ETYMOLOGICAL GROUNDS IS INDEFENSIBLE
LATER GEORGIAN DAYS 119 IX
MANY ROYAL LADIES OF EUROPE CONTEMPORARIES OF QUEEN VICTORIA AND HER SON HAVE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING CONFIRMED SMOKERS
I THINK NOT SAID THE POET BUT TIRED WITH THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF TOO MUCH SMOKING KINGSLEY'S DEVOTION TO SMOKE SEEMS TO HAVE SURPRISED TENNYSON WHO WAS NO LIGHT SMOKER HIMSELF
THE PIPE WHICH HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SMOKED ON THE EVENING BEFORE HIS EXECUTION TOGETHER WITH HIS SNUFF-BOX AND A CANVAS TOBACCO-BAG WERE FOR MANY YEARS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF COGERS THE FAMOUS DEBATING SOCIETY OF FLEET STREET
A VALUED CORRESPONDENT TELLS ME THAT HE KNOWS A HOUSE WHERE TOBACCO IS STILL KEPT OUT OF THE DINING-ROOM AND SMOKE INDULGED IN ELSEWHERE AFTER WINE
NEXT DOOR BUT ONE TO ST CHRISTOPHER'S CHURCH THREADNEEDLE STREET THE SHOP-BILL OF RICHARD LEE WHO SOLD TOBACCO ABOUT 1730 AT YE GOLDEN TOBACCO ROLL IN PANTON STREET NEAR LEICESTER FIELDS IS AN ELABORATE PRODUCTION
THE GOOD WOMAN SLOWLY PRODUCED A WELL-SEASONED CUTTY PIPE AND AS SHE BEGAN TO CUT UP A FILL FROM A RANK-SMELLING TOBACCO REPLIED
HE WAS PROBABLY NOT A SMOKER HIMSELF FOR HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT IN OTHER RESPECTS THE COFFEE-HOUSES ARE LOATHSOME FULL OF SMOKE LIKE A GUARDROOM AND AS MUCH CROWDED HE FURTHER OBSERVED THAT IT WAS COMMON TO SEE THE CLERGY OF LONDON IN COFFEE-HOUSES AND EVEN IN TAVERNS WITH PIPES IN THEIR MOUTHS
IN HIS JOURNAL JULY 4 1829 HE NOTED--"WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY BIT OF DINNER AND WAS IN A QUIET WAY SMOKING MY CIGAR OVER A GLASS OF NEGUS ADAM FERGUSON COMES WITH A SUMMONS TO ATTEND HIM TO THE JUSTICE CLERK'S WHERE IT SEEMS I WAS ENGAGED
REJECT NOT MY LETTER THOUGH IT IS REDOLENT OF CIGARS AND GENUINE PIGTAIL
THE SIXTH IS THAT YOU DRINK NOT BETWEEN THE TAKING OF THE FUMES AS OUR IDLE AND SMOAKIE TOBACCONISTS ARE WONT"--THERE MUST BE NO ALLIANCE IN SHORT BETWEEN THE PIPE AND THE CHEERFUL GLASS
HE GAVE A DIPLOMATIC REPLY
ON THE WALL HANGS TWO PICTURES
WE MAKE THE GIANTS FIRST AND THEN DO NOT KILL THEM SCOTT'S REMARK THAT LOCKHART SMOKED WHEN AN OXFORD STUDENT RATHER DISCREDITS ARCHDEACON'S DENISON'S STATEMENT QUOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THAT SMOKING WAS VERY GENERALLY UNKNOWN IN OXFORD IN 1823-24
THE PLATE OF THE DISTREST POET 1736 SHOWS FOUR BOOKS AND THREE TOBACCO-PIPES ON A SHELF
AND IN ANOTHER PLACE ADDRESSES TOBACCO AS THOU BEGGARLY MONARCHE OF INDIANS AND SETTER UP OF ROTTEN-LUNGD CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS AND PROCEEDS IN A LIKE STRAIN OF ABUSE
MOST OF THESE PERISHED WITH THE OCCASION THAT CALLED THEM FORTH
AFTER THAT A SECOND AND A THIRD PIPE WITHOUT THE LEAST CONCERN AS IT IS SAID TO HAVE DONE ABOVE A YEAR AGO A CHILD OF TWO YEARS OF AGE SMOKING THREE PIPES IN SUCCESSION IS A PICTURE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT AS TRUE
HERE TOOK PLACE NOT ONLY TILTING PROPERLY SO CALLED BUT ROPE-WALKING PERFORMANCES BEAR AND BULL-BAITING DANCING AND OTHER DIVERSIONS WHICH HER MAJESTY HELD IN HIGH FAVOUR
HE HAD A CELLAR OF SNUFF WHICH AFTER HIS DEATH WAS SOLD SAID JOHN BULL AUGUST 15 1830 TO A WELL-KNOWN PURVEYOR FOR L400 LORD PETERSHAM FAMOUS AMONG DANDIES MADE A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF SNUFFS AND SNUFF-BOXES AND WAS CURIOUS IN HIS CHOICE OF A BOX TO CARRY
THE OLDEST METHOD OF TAKING SNUFF SAYS LARWOOD IN THE HISTORY OF SIGNBOARDS WAS TO SCRAPE IT WITH A RASP FROM THE DRY ROOT OF THE TOBACCO PLANT
AMONG THE DOCUMENTS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF SCOTLAND THERE IS A LETTER PATENT UNDER THE GREAT SEAL OF CHARLES I IN 1634 GRANTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CORRECTING THE IRREGULAR SALES AND RESTRAINING THE IMMODERATE USE OF TOBACCO IN SCOTLAND
CAMPBELL SENT WORD THAT HE WOULD LOOK IN IN THE MORNING AND CORRECT IT
IN TRUTH OUR WONDERMENTS ARE VERY PLEASANT THINGS AND WITH THAT SAGE AND SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION TO HIS CATECHISM WE MAY LEAVE M
MEMBERS SOMETIMES OBJECTED TO AND PROTESTED AGAINST THIS NOTE-TAKING BUT BURTON QUIETLY WENT ON USING HIS PENCIL AND THOUGH HIS SUMMARIES OF SPEECHES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ARGUMENT AND SENSE SUFFERING BY COMPRESSION HE HAS PRESERVED MUCH VERY VALUABLE MATTER
MOTHER GAVE IN SOON--I THINK SHE ONLY DID IT OUT OF VANITY
IN ANY CASE THE ENTIRE ABSENCE OF ANY ALLUSIONS WHATEVER TO SMOKING IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM IN OUR PRE-ELIZABETHAN LITERATURE OR IN MEDIAEVAL OR EARLIER ART IS SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT FROM THE SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW SMOKING DID NOT THEN EXIST
BUT SMOKING MUST BE IN THE STUDY
MACAULAY HAS DRAWN FOR US THE NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE PICTURE OF THE SMOKING-ROOM OF THE OLD HOUSE OF COMMONS--BEFORE THE FIRE OF 1834--IN A LETTER TO HIS SISTER DATED IN THE SUMMER OF 1831
BUT WHEN A YOUNG SNOB WENT SO FAR AS TO LIGHT A CIGAR THERE HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF FINISHING IT IN THE COUNTRY FOR HE WAS RUSTICATED
TOBACCO-SMOKE ALWAYS CAUSED BRASS GREAT INTERNAL DISCOMPOSURE AND ANNOYANCE
BUT ALL HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM LONDON STREETS SAVE TWO--I SAY TWO ON THE AUTHORITY OF MR E.V
IT SHOWS THE DUKE LEANING OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE WINDOW WITH HIS PIPE IN HIS HAND
EVELYN DESCRIBING CROMWELL'S SUPERB FUNERAL SAYS THAT THE SOLDIERS IN THE PROCESSION WERE DRINKING AND TAKING TOBACCO IN THE STREETS AS THEY WENT WHETHER THE USE OF TOBACCO PREVAILED AS GENERALLY AMONG THE CAVALIER FORCES IS LESS CERTAIN
I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE RUN MAD O THE BLACK BOY IN BUCKLERSBURY THAT TAKES THE SCURVY ROGUY TOBACCO THERE LATER THE BLACK BOY LIKE OTHER ONCE SIGNIFICANT SIGNS BECAME MEANINGLESS AND WAS USED IN CONNEXION WITH VARIOUS TRADES
THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT PEPYS EVEN SMOKED WHICH CONSIDERING HIS PROFICIENCY IN THE ARTS OF GOOD-FELLOWSHIP IS PERHAPS A LITTLE SURPRISING
WHATEVER KEEPS A MAN IN THE FRONT GARDEN WHATEVER CHECKS WANDERING FANCY AND ALL INORDINATE AMBITION WHATEVER MAKES FOR LOUNGING AND CONTENTMENT MAKES JUST SO SURELY FOR DOMESTIC HAPPINESS NOTHING IS MORE MARKED IN THE CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS TOBACCO THAN THE REVOLUTION WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN WOMAN'S VIEW OF SMOKING
THE VICAR OF LANCASTER AT HIS EASTER VESTRY MEETING IN 1913 COMPLAINED OF BANK-HOLIDAY VISITORS TO THE PARISH CHURCH WHO ATE THEIR LUNCH SMOKED AND WORE THEIR HATS WHILE LOOKING ROUND THE BUILDING
X EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS SCENT TO MATCH THY RICH PERFUME CHEMIC ART DID NE'ER PRESUME THROUGH HER QUAINT ALEMBIC STRAIN NONE SO SOVEREIGN TO THE BRAIN
THE PIPE RENDERS ITS SERVICE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND YET REMAINS--A STEADFAST COMPANION
THE ESSAYIST GOES ON TO SAY
BUT USED IN MODERATION WHAT EVILS LET ME ASK,"--I AGAIN QUOTE DR ANDREW WILSON'S CALM GOOD SENSE--"ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE TRAIN OF THE TOBACCO-HABIT
OLD PARTY REALLY SIR,--I AM THE MANAGER OF THE LINE SIR--I MUST INFORM YOU THAT IF YOU PERSIST IN SMOKING YOU WILL BE FINED FORTY SHILLINGS SIR
SURE HIS THROAT IS ON FIRE THE SMOKE FLYETH SO FAST FROM HIS MOUTH IT MAY BE NOTED BY THE WAY THAT THE GALLANT HAD NO HESITATION ABOUT SMOKING IN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES
AND THE WHOLE ROOM STINKING OF TOBACCO LIKE A DUTCH SCOOT OR A BOATSWAIN'S CABIN
BUT THERE WERE SIGNS OF CHANGE IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS AS WE HAVE SEEN AND SMOKING HAD TO A LARGE EXTENT CEASED TO BE FASHIONABLE
BUT THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CIGARS AND CIGARETTES ONLY SHALL BE SMOKED
I HAVE TRIED TO CONFINE MYSELF STRICTLY TO THE CHANGES IN THE ATTITUDE OF SOCIETY TOWARDS SMOKING AND TO SUCH HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL SIDELIGHTS AS SERVE TO ILLUMINATE THAT THEME
IT WAS ONLY IN LARGE HOUSES THAT A BILLIARD ROOM COULD BE FOUND AND EVEN IN A BILLIARD ROOM A PIPE OR CIGAR WAS TABOO IF LADIES WERE PRESENT WHILE SMOKING-ROOMS COULD NO MORE BE FOUND IN MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSES THAN BATH-ROOMS
OH TO HAVE A HUSBAND WITH A MOUTH CONTINUALLY SMOKING WITH A BUSH OF FURS ON THE RIDGE OF HIS CHIN READIE STILL TO FLOP INTO HIS FOAMING CHOPS TIS MORE THAN MOST INTOLERABLE AND SIMILAR INDICATIONS OF DISLIKE TO SMOKING COULD BE QUOTED FROM OTHER PLAYS
THE LIST OF PRICES AND NAMES GIVEN BY WIMBLE A SNUFF-SELLER ABOUT 1740 AND PRINTED IN FAIRHOLT'S HISTORY OF TOBACCO CONTAINS EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF RAPPEE--ENGLISH BEST ENGLISH FINE ENGLISH HIGH-FLAVOURED COARSE LOW SCENTED COMPOSITE C
ONE OF THE MARKED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GALLANT--THE BEAU OR DANDY OR SWELL OF THE TIME--WAS HIS DEVOTION TO TOBACCO
SMOKING BY WOMEN 205 XIV
EARLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY A BOOKSELLER AT THE SIGN OF THE BLACK BOY ON LONDON BRIDGE WAS ADVERTISING DEFOE'S ROBINSON CRUSOE
PEN GOES FROM BAD TO WORSE DURING HIS UNIVERSITY DAYS AND SAD TO SAY ONE SUNDAY IN THE LAST LONG VACATION THE WRETCHED BOY INSTEAD OF GOING TO CHURCH WAS SEEN AT THE GATE OF THE CLAVERING ARMS SMOKING A CIGAR IN THE FACE OF THE CONGREGATION AS IT ISSUED FROM ST MARY'S
YET GOING ON TO DESCRIBE A JOURNEY TO HASTINGS SITTING ON THE ROOF IN FRONT BESIDE AN ACQUAINTANCE HE SAYS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENJOYMENT OF DASHING ALONG ANECDOTE AND JEST GOING MERRILY ON WE HAD THE ANNOYANCE OF A COXCOMB PERCHED ON THE BOX INFECTING THE FRESH AIR WHICH HEAVEN HAD SENT US WITH THE SMOKE OF HIS ABOMINABLE CIGAR WHICH LOOKS AS IF HIS REAL OBJECTION WAS TO CIGARS AS SUCH
