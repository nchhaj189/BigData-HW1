SPRINKLE WITH THE PARMESAN CHEESE AND SERVE VERY HOT FROM A CHAFING DISH
HERE ARE WINES FROM THE SLOPES OF AETNA SPARKLING AND SWEET
AROUND AT 168 O'FARRELL STREET JUST OPPOSITE THE ORPHEUM THEATRE IS TAIT-ZINKAND RESTAURANT OR AS IT IS MORE POPULARLY KNOWN TAIT'S JOHN TAIT IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT HERE HE HAVING MADE REPUTATION AS CLUB MANAGER AND THEN AS MANAGER OF THE CLIFF HOUSE

ASIDE FROM ITS ODDITIES IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST PLACES FOR A GOOD MEAL FOR BAB HAD THE ART OF CATERING DOWN TO A NICETY
BY OLIVER CHEF OF THE RESTAURANT DES BEAUX ARTS PARIS IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE FINDS BOTH THE IMPORTED AND THE DOMESTIC PASTE AND FREQUENTLY ONE HEARS THE ASSERTION THAT THE IMPORTED IS THE BETTER
YOU CANNOT MISS IT FOR IT HAS A PICTURE OF FIORINI HIMSELF AS A SIGN AND ON IT HE TELLS YOU THAT IF YOU EAT HIS PASTE YOU WILL GET TO BE AS FAT AS HE IS
WHEN IN A SAN FRANCISCO RESTAURANT YOU ARE ASKED WHAT SORT OF OYSTER YOU WILL HAVE AND YOU SEE THE FAMILIAR NAMES ON THE MENU CARD REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE TRANSPLANTED OYSTERS AND HAVE LOST MUCH OF THEIR FLAVOR IN THE TRANSPLANTING OR ELSE THEY ARE OYSTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND HAVE THEREBY LOST THEIR FRESHNESS
YOU NOW HAVE THE WIDEST RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES BOTH AS TO VIANDS AND AS TO PRICE
THIS WAS DESTROYED BY THE FIRE AND ALL THE WORKS OF ART LOST
IT IS UNCONSCIOUS HUMOR ON PART OF THE ORCHESTRA CONSEQUENTLY IS ALL THE MORE EXCRUCIATING
COOL AND FREEZE
TO ALL THESE AND MANY MORE THE LATIN QUARTER OF SAN FRANCISCO POSSESSED A CHARM THEY COULD FIND NOWHERE ELSE AND IF ONE DESIRE TO BRING A SADDENED LOOK TO THE FACES OF MANY NOW LIVING ELSEWHERE IT IS BUT NECESSARY TO TALK OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN BOHEMIA WAS ON TELEGRAPH HILL IN SAN FRANCISCO
1898 AND 1904
THE FRUITCAKE DEVELOPED INTO PRESSED DARK MEAT OF CHICKEN WITH AN ICING OF PRESSED AND GLAZED WHITE MEAT OF THE SAME FOWL
FRY THEM IN OLIVE OIL
SOME CALL IT AN OUTRAGE AND ASK FOR LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE
GO A LITTLE FURTHER UP BROADWAY AND YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE SIGNS CHANGING FROM SPANISH TO FRENCH AND IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THEM YOU WILL KNOW THAT HERE YOU WILL BE GIVEN A DINNER FOR TWENTY-FIVE CENTS ON WEEK DAYS AND FOR THIRTY-FIVE CENTS ON SUNDAYS
NEXT TO IT IS COPPA'S BUT IT IS NO LONGER RUN BY COPPA
PUT INTO THE OVEN AGAIN AND COOK FOR HALF AN HOUR BASTING FREQUENTLY WITH THE ORIGINAL BRINE
TO THIS ADD THE MEAT AND GIBLETS AND A PINT OF WHITE BROTH
COVER THIS FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN POUR OVER IT THE REST OF THE SOUP
WINE IS EXTRA
THEY NOT ONLY ATTRACTED ATTENTION BY THEIR LOUDNESS AND OUTRE ACTIONS BUT THEY CALLED NOTICE BY PELTING OTHER DINERS WITH MISSILES OF BREAD
A CUP OF HOT COFFEE WHILE DRESSING SERVED TO GET US WIDE-AWAKE AND WE WERE OFF TO SEE THE FISH COME IN
NOT ONLY IS THIS TRUE OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY BUT THEIR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF COOKING AND FOOD VALUES BRINGS ABOUT A WASTE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS CALLED THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IT IS A TRITE BUT NEVERTHELESS TRUE SAYING THAT A FRENCH FAMILY COULD LIVE WELL ON WHAT AN AMERICAN FAMILY WASTES
SOME ARE FOR SOUPS SOME FOR SAUCES AND ALL FOR SPECIAL EDIBILITY
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND KEEP ON ICE
THESE ROOMS WERE MOST LAVISH IN THEIR DECORATION THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURE BEING THAT THEY WERE ALL MADE OF DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOODS HIGHLY POLISHED
LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE-HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT
MANY COMPLEX RECIPES COULD BE GIVEN AND SOME OF THESE WILL APPEAR IN THE PART OF THE BOOK DEVOTED TO RECIPES BUT WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE RECIPES MENTIONED IT CAN READILY BE SEEN THAT IT TAKES LITTLE PREPARATION TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY
THE SLIGHTLY COPPERY TASTE OF THE CALIFORNIA OYSTERS GIVES A PIQUANCY TO THE FLAVOR OF THE OMELET THAT CAN BE OBTAINED IN NO OTHER WAY AND THOSE WHO ONCE ATE OF ARBOGAST'S CALIFORNIA OYSTER OMELET INVARIABLY CALLED FOR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
BUT THE STEPPING ACROSS THE STREET AND ONE PASSES FROM ONE LAND TO THE OTHER FINDING ALL THE PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AS INDELIBLY FIXED AS IF THEY WERE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
TO SOME GOOD FRIEND
LIEUTENANT JOHN DERBY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN WESTERN AUTHORS OF THAT DAY MADE IT HIS HEADQUARTERS
ONE-THIRD MAYONNAISE TWO-THIRDS CHILI SAUCE SMALL QUANTITY CHOPPED ENGLISH CHOW-CHOW A LITTLE WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE AND MINCED TARRAGON SHALLOTS AND SWEET PARSLEY
SIMILAR TO BRAUNEBERGER
SIMILAR TO BRAUNEBERGER
THIS IS THE WAY HE WROTE THE RECIPE FOR RISOTTO MILANAISE
SPRINKLE WITH PARMESAN CHEESE
AT THAT TIME THERE GREW UP A MUSHROOM CROP OF SO-CALLED RESTAURANTS IN COLUMBUS AVENUE CLOSE TO BARBARY COAST SUCH AS CAESAR'S THE FOLLIES CABARET JUPITER AND EL PARADISO WHERE SPACE WAS RESERVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR FOR DANCING
NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A PICTURE TO BRING A SENTIMENT OF THE OCEAN TO THE MIND
FROM STRINGS SO THIN AS TO APPEAR ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LADY'S LITTLE FINGER TO INDIVIDUAL SAUSAGES AS LARGE AS THE THIGH OF A GIANT THEY HANG IN FESTOONS CRAWL OVER BEAMS LIE ALONG SHELVES DECORATE COUNTERS PEEP FROM BOXES ON THE FLOOR AND INVITE YOU TO TASTE THEM IN THE SLICES THAT LAY ON THE BUTCHER'S BLOCK
THERE IS ALSO A SWEET TAMALE MADE WITH RAISINS OR PRESERVES
AGAIN IN THE AUTOMOBILE TO COPPA'S WHERE CHICKEN PORTOLA WAS SERVED WITH GREEN PEAS
WHEN THE CHILIES ARE FRIED TURN THE REMAINDER OF THE BATTER INTO THE TOMATOES AND BOIL TWENTY MINUTES THEN TURN THIS SAUCE OVER THE PEPPERS
THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE BOHEMIANISM OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE TELLING YOU ABOUT IT IN A BOOK THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEVOTED TO THE BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO TAKE CHARGE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS DO AS YOU PLEASE AND GO AS FAR AS YOU LIKE THAT IS A WIDE ORDER GENERAL
HERE HAVE CONGREGATED THE WORLD'S GREATEST CHEFS AND WHEN ONE EXCLAIMS IN ECSTASY OVER A WONDERFUL FLAVOR FOUND IN SOME DINGY RESTAURANT LET HIM NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE LEARN THAT THE CHEF WHO CONCOCTED THE DISH BOASTS ROYAL DECORATION FOR TICKLING THE PALATE OF SOME EPICUREAN RULER OF FOREIGN LAND
IT IS ALWAYS STRICTLY FRESH AND BOOKED TO SUIT THE MOST FASTIDIOUS TASTE
ONE PINT CHICKEN STOCK OR VEAL ONE TABLESPOONFUL LEMON JUICE ONE-EIGHTH TEASPOON PEPPER ONE LEVEL TEASPOON SALT
PETER JOB PALACE OF ART POP FLOYD RECEPTION SANGUINETTI'S TEHAMA HOUSE THREE TREES TORTONI THOMPSON'S VITICULTURAL ZINKAND'S END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S BOHEMIAN SAN FRANCISCO BY CLARENCE E
HE HAD VERY GOOD SERVICE AND THE BEST OF COOKING AND FOR MANY YEARS HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS MEN GATHERED THERE AT LUNCHEON IN LIEU OF A CLUB
HE CATERED TO A CLASS OF MEN WHO KNEW GOOD LIQUORS AND HIS PLACE WAS A GREAT RESORT FOR CHILDREN OF WHOM HE WAS FOND AND WHO WENT THERE TO SEE THE ANIMALS
IT HAS DONE DUTY IN DESCRIBING ALMOST EVERY FORM OF LICENSE AND LICENTIOUSNESS
IT IS BUT A STEP ACROSS A STREET FROM AMERICA INTO JAPAN THEN ANOTHER STEP INTO CHINA
HERE MEALS WERE SERVED TO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN THE LATTER BEING ATTRACTED BY THE ARTISTIC DISPLAY AND UNIQUE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE
OR YOU MAY ORDER ANYTHING IN THE MARKET AND YOU WILL FIND IT COOKED THE BEST WAY ONE OF THE SPECIALTIES OF JACK'S IS FISH FOR WHICH THE RESTAURANT IS NOTED
LINE THE BOTTOM OF A MOLD WITH SULTANA RAISINS WHICH HAVE BEEN SOAKED IN SHERRY WINE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
IN THESE ROOMS GUESTS WERE SERVED WITH THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDED BY DISCREET DARKEYS
MACARI MEANS FINE EXCELLENT AND THE SUPERLATIVE IS MACARONI A FAMOUS ITALIAN GOURMET CONSTANTLY DESIRED NEW DISHES TO PLEASE HIS TASTE AND ONE DAY HIS CHEF CARRIED TO HIM SOMETHING THAT WAS UNUSUAL
FINE FOR ROAST BEEF
ALL ITALIAN RESTAURANTS SERVE THE PASTE AS A RELEVE RATHER THAN AS AN ENTREE WHICH IT USUALLY FOLLOWS PRECEDING THE ROAST IN THE DINNER
PROBABLY THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHINATOWN IS THAT OF THE HANG FAR LOW COMPANY AT 723 GRANT AVENUE
WE DO NOT PROPOSE TO DISCUSS THIS PHASE OF BARBARY COAST AS THAT IS NOT A PART OF BOHEMIANISM
IT IS SAID OF HIS TURKEYS THAT THEIR FLAVOR WAS OF SUCH EXCELLENCE THAT ONE OF THE GOURMANDS OF THAT DAY MICHAEL REECE WOULD ALWAYS ORDER TWO WHEN HE GAVE A DINNER--ONE FOR HIS GUESTS AND ONE FOR HIMSELF
OVER IN ONE CORNER OF THE STIFLING ROOM ON A RAISED PLATFORM SAT TWO OILY AND FAT NEGROES MAKING THE PLACE HIDEOUS WITH THEIR RIBALD SONGS AND THE TWANGING OF A GUITAR AND BANJO
SWEETEN TO TASTE
THEN FOLLOWED SAKI IN LITTLE ARTISTIC BOTTLES AND SAKI CUPS THAT HOLD NOT MUCH MORE THAN A DOUBLE TABLESPOONFUL
AS IT IS IN GERMANY WHEN YOU SEE AUGUST DO NOT FAIL TO PRONOUNCE IT OWGOOST IN REPOSE YOU INVOLUNTARILY SAY THAT IS IF YOU UNDERSTAND GERMAN MIR IST ALLES AN WHICH IS THE GERMAN EQUIVALENT OF I SHOULD WORRY WHEN AUGUST IS IN ACTION YOU IMMEDIATELY GET A THIRST THAT NOTHING BUT A STEIN OF COLD BEER WILL QUENCH
EVERYBODY AROUND THEM AND WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT SPEAKS ITALIAN
LOBSTER IN MINIATURE CRAWFISH OR ECRAVISSE HAS NEVER BEEN VERY POPULAR IN SAN FRANCISCO PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER DELICATE CRUSTACEANS THAT ARE MORE EASILY HANDLED YET THE CRAWFISH GROWS TO PERFECTION IN PACIFIC WATERS AND IMPORTATION'S OF THEM FROM PORTLAND OREGON ARE BECOMING QUITE AN INDUSTRY
ADD CHERVIL AND TARRAGON
PUT IN THE CHICKEN ONION AND ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA OYSTERS BACK INTO THE BROTH AND SEASON WITH SALT PEPPER JUICE OF A LEMON BRUISED CLOVE OF GARLIC CHOPPED GREEN PEPPER AND A PINCH OF RED PEPPER
THE SAND OR HARD SHELL OR AS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED LITTLE NECKS ARE NEXT IN CHOICENESS AND THEN COME THE PISMO BEACH CLAMS NOTED FOR THEIR FLAVOR AND ENORMOUS SIZE
PUT THE GARNISHING AROUND THE FILLETS AND PUT ON ICE TO GET IN JELLY
RUB TOGETHER AND PASS THROUGH A FINE SIEVE
HERE IS THE PART OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT FIRST FELT THE RESTORATION IMPULSE AND THIS WAS THE FIRST PART OF SAN FRANCISCO REBUILT AFTER THE GREAT FIRE AND IN ITS REBUILDING IT RECOVERED ALL OF ITS FORMER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH IS MORE THAN CAN BE SAID OF ANY OTHER PART OF THE REBUILT CITY
I SMILE BACK AND WISH THEM WELL
BEAT THE EGGS TO A FROTH AND STIR IN THE ONION CHOPPED FINE
LET US WALK FIRST ALONG GRANT AVENUE AND DO A LITTLE WINDOW SHOPPING
ONION SOUP CUT FOUR LARGE ONIONS IN LARGE PIECES AND PUT THEM IN SIX OUNCES OF BUTTER WITH PEPPER AND SALT
YOU MAY THICKEN THE TERRAPIN WITH THE FOLLOWING MIXTURE
PUT ON THIS SALT AND PEPPER AND SPRINKLE WITH A LITTLE FLOUR AND THEN A LAYER OF CRACKERS
POSSIBLY OUR POINT OF VIEW WILL NOT COINCIDE WITH THAT OF OTHERS BUT WHILE THERE ARE DOZENS OF OTHER BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS THERE IS BUT ONE HEIDELBERG INN
POUR THE BISQUE QUITE HOT INTO THE TUREEN IN WHICH HAVE BEEN PLACED THE CRAWFISH TAILS AND SEND TO THE TABLE
RALSTON DETERMINED THAT THE CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE SHOULD HAVE A HOTEL COMMENSURATE WITH ITS IMPORTANCE
OFTEN ONE DESIRES SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THIS IS EASY TOO AND YOU CAN CONSERVE YOUR BRAIN ENERGY AND GET THE MOST FOR THE LEAST MONEY BY SEEING THE PROPRIETOR OR MANAGER OF THE RESTAURANT AND TELLING HIM THAT YOU WISH TO GIVE A LITTLE DINNER
OYSTERS A LA CATALAN TAKE ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER TWO TEASPOONFULS GRATED EDAM OR PARMESAN CHEESE FOUR TABLESPOONFULS CATSUP ONE-HALF TEASPOONFUL WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE TWO TABLESPOONFULS CREAM MEAT OF ONE GOOD-SIZED CRAB CUT FINE AND TWO DOZEN OYSTERS
A FLANK STEAK PERHAPS PREPARED EN CASSEROLE AND YOU WOULD HAVE A FINE DISH FOR HALF THE MONEY
PRODUCED BY DAVID A
REMARKABLE FOR ITS RICH AND VELVETY SOFTNESS
THEN YOU WILL HAVE A RESTAURANT THAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT WHEREVER PEOPLE SIT AT MEAT
THAT IS FAIRLY GOOD AS A CLAM SOUP BUT IT IS NO MORE CHOWDER THAN A MEXICAN SOUP APPROACHES A CRAWFISH BISQUE
TAKE CORN MEAL AND WORK INTO IT A LUMP OF BUTTER THE SIZE OF AN EGG ADDING BOILING WATER AND WORKING CONSTANTLY UNTIL IT MAKES A PASTE THE CONSISTENCY OF BISCUIT DOUGH
YOU WILL GET YOUR OWN BREAKFASTS WHEN AND HOW YOU WANT THEM
THE EXTREMES ARE RARITIES AND SOMETIMES DUTY AND BURDEN ARE SYNONYMOUS
MAKE A STOCK OF ONE SOUP HEN OR CHICKEN BONES AND FIVE POUNDS OF VEAL BONES IN THE USUAL MANNER WITH CARROTS ONIONS PARSLEY BAY LEAVES SALT AND PEPPER
MASH THE CLOVE OF GARLIC RUBBING THOROUGHLY IN A MORTAR AND ON THIS PUT THE BUTTER AND FLOUR MIXING WELL TOGETHER AND GRADUALLY ADDING THE SALT AND MINIONETTE PEPPER AND STIR IN TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF CREAM
OUT BY MARSHALL SQUARE BY THE CITY HALL WAS GOOD FELLOW'S GROTTO STARTED BY TECHAU WHO AFTERWARD BUILT AND RAN THE TECHAU TAVERN
LIGHT AND PLEASANT
WHILE COOKING ADD A PINT OF MEAT STOCK A LITTLE BUTTER AND SOME ANISE SEED
YOU WILL FIND ARTISTS SCULPTORS AND WRITERS OF VERSE IN EMBRYO AND IF YOU REMAIN LONG ENOUGH IN THE ATMOSPHERE YOU MAY SEE AS WE HAVE SOME OF THESE EMBRYONIC THINKERS ACHIEVE FAME THAT BECOMES NATION WIDE
ALL HAVE BROUGHT WITH THEM RECIPES AND TRADITIONS SOME DATING BACK FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS OR EVEN THOUSANDS TO THE DAYS BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA WAS BORN
ALL OF THESE PLACES OR AT LEAST RESTAURANTS WITH THESE NAMES ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE
THESE PLATES CONTAINED WHAT APPEARED TO BE CAKE ONE SEEMING TO BE ANGEL FOOD WITH ICING AND THE OTHER FRUIT CAKE WITH THE SAME COVERING
FIRST CAME THE APPETIZERS IN FORM OF THIN SLICES OF SALAMI AND OF A PECULIAR MEXICAN SAUSAGE SO EXTREMELY HOT WITH CHILI PEPINO AS TO IMMEDIATELY CALL FOR A DRINK OF CLARET TO ASSUAGE THE BURNING
MUSSELS MARINIERE THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE MUSSELS AND THEN PUT THEM IN A DEEP PAN AND POUR OVER THEM HALF A GLASS OF WHITE WINE
IT IS NOT AT ALL DIFFICULT TO HAVE A DINNER WITHOUT WINE THAT COSTS TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS A PLATE AND WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE MORE NORMAL DINNERS UNLESS YOU CONFINE YOURSELF TO ONE OR TWO DISHES YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU FAR EXCEED IN PRICE THE TABLE D'HOTE DINNERS OF EQUAL GASTRONOMIC VALUE
BY THE TIME WE FINISHED WITH PALADINI'S FISH WE FELT READY FOR BREAKFAST AND TOOK A CAR DOWN TO DAVIS AND PACIFIC STREET WHERE WE FOUND BAZZURO'S SERVING BREAKFAST TO DOZENS OF MARKET GARDENERS WHO HAD FINISHED THEIR UNLOADING AND THERE WHILE PARTAKING OF THE FRESH FISH WE HAD BROUGHT FROM FISHERMEN'S WHARF WE SAW ANOTHER PHASE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S EARLY MORNING LIFE
HOCHHEIMER
SHE COOKS FROM DAYLIGHT UNTIL DARK AND STOPS COOKING ONLY WHEN SHE IS AT CHURCH IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HER DOMESTIC AND RELIGIOUS DUTIES DOMINATED HER LIFE AND SHE KNEW BUT TWO THINGS--TO PLEASE HER GOD AND TO CARE FOR HER FAMILY AND WITHOUT QUESTION IF OCCASION DEMANDED THE PLEASURE OF HER FAMILY TOOK PRECEDENCE
HERE WERE SOME OF THE FINEST PAINTINGS AND MARBLE CARVINGS TO BE FOUND IN THE CITY TOGETHER WITH BEAUTIFUL HAMMERED SILVER PLAQUES AND CUPS
THEIR FLAVOR IS MORE DELICIOUS THAN THAT OF ANY HAM YOU HAVE TASTED SINCE YOU USED TO GET THE OLD-TIME GENUINE COUNTRY SMOKED HAMS
LIPS LINGER LOVINGLY OVER SUCH NAMES AS THE VALLEJOS THE PICOS AND THOSE OTHER SPANISH FAMILIES WHO SPREAD THEIR HOSPITALITY WITH SUCH WONDROUS PRODIGALITY THAT THEIR OPEN WELCOME BECAME A BY-WORD IN ALL PARTS OF THE WEST
THIS WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE TYPE KNOWN AS FRENCH RESTAURANTS AND NUMEROUS CONVIVIAL PARTIES OF MEN AND WOMEN FOUND ITS PRIVATE ROOMS CONVENIENT FOR RENDEZVOUS
SAN FRANCISCO HAS CALLED TO THE WORLD FOR ITS BEST AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN SO PROMPT THAT NO COUNTRY HAS FAILED TO SEND ITS TRIBUTE AND GIVE THE BEST THOUGHT OF THOSE WHO CATER TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO KNOW
NOTHING BUT A PORTERHOUSE OR TENDERLOIN STEAK OR A KIDNEY CHOP WILL DO
ALL THEY KNEW OF MEATS WAS CONFINED TO ORDINARY POULTRY I
IT DEVELOPED THAT THE SHREDDED MASS ON TOP WAS THE MEAT OF THE LOBSTER WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED LEAVING THE SHELL-FISH IN PERFECT FORM
IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT IN THE USE OF ALL FLAVORS AND CONDIMENTS THERE MAY BE AN INTEMPERANCE THERE LYING THE ROOT OF MUCH OF THE BAD COOKING
THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS
IN O'FARRELL STREET THE DELMONICO WAS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE FRENCH RESTAURANTS UNTIL THE FIRE
BUT YOU HAVE THE REAL ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS ENHANCED BY THE MOTTOES IN DECORATION AND THE FLAGONS STEMS AND PLAQUES THAT ADORN THE PILLARS AS WELL AS TYPICAL GERMAN ENVIRONMENT
HERE IS STILL THE MEMORY OF BRET HARTE AND MARK TWAIN
IN A LARGE STEWPAN PLACE THE SALT PORK CUT INTO SMALL DICE AND LET THIS FRY SLIGHTLY OVER A SLOW FIRE UNTIL THE BOTTOM OF THE STEWPAN IS WELL GREASED
MANY PEOPLE FROM THE RESIDENTIAL PART OF THE CITY AND MANY VISITORS AT THE HOTELS WENT THERE AS A PART OF SLUMMING TRIPS BUT THE REAL SENTIMENT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE YOUNG GIRL WHEN SHE SANG OUT IS EVERYBODY HAPPY SANGUINETTI STILL HAS HIS RESTAURANT AND THERE IS STILL TO BE FOUND THE PERSPIRING DARKEYS PLAYING AND SINGING THEIR IMPOSSIBLE MUSIC AND A CROWD STILL CONGREGATES THERE BUT IT IS NOT THE OLD CROWD FOR THIS LIKE ALL THINGS ELSE IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS CHANGED AND INSTEAD OF THE OLD-TIME ASSEMBLAGE OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE LACK OF CONVENTION CAME FROM THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THERE IS NOW A CROWD OF YOUNG AND OLD PEOPLE WHO PATRONIZE IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD IT IS SO BOHEMIAN THRIFTY HOTEL GUIDES TAKE TOURISTS THERE AND TELL THEM IT IS THE ONLY REAL BOHEMIAN RESTAURANT IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WHEN THE OUTLANDERS SEE THE ANTICS OF THE PEOPLE AND LISTEN TO THE RIBALD JESTS AND BAD MUSIC OF THE DARKEYS THEY GO BACK TO THEIR HOTELS AND TELL WITH BATED BREATH
TAGLIARINI DES BEAUX ARTS COOK ONE POUND OF TAGLIARINI IN BOILING WATER TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES THEN DRAW OFF THE WATER
BEAT THE YOLKS OF EGGS IN A SAUCEPAN GRADUALLY POURING THE COOKED SAUCE UPON THEM
THIS APPEARED TO BE COVERED WITH SHREDDED COCOANUT AND WHEN IT WAS PLACED BEFORE THE HOST FOR SERVING HE WAS AT LOSS FOR NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO
APPEALING FROM ITS ROMANTIC SURROUNDINGS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORY AND ATTRACTIVE THROUGH ITS COMBINATION OF DASHING WAVES AND BEAUTIFUL BEACH EXTENDING MILES IN ONE DIRECTION WITH THE RUGGED ENTRANCE TO GOLDEN GATE IN THE OTHER WITH THE MYSTERIOUS FARALLONES IN THE DIM DISTANCE THE CLIFF HOUSE MAY WELL BE CLASSED AS ONE OF THE GREAT BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO
YOU WILL THEN BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE A VARIETY OF GOOD FISH
SERVE WITH STRAWS
ONE OF THESE IS THE RENDEZVOUS OF ANARCHISTS WHO GATHER EACH EVENING AND DISCUSS THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD AND HOW TO REGULATE THEM
THE BOHEMIAN WAY TO HAVE YOUR CLAMS IS TO GO TO THE SHORE OF BOLINAS BAY OR SOME OTHER EQUALLY RETIRED SPOT AND HAVE A CLAM BAKE OR ELSE TAKE A POT ALONG WITH THE OTHER INGREDIENTS AND HAVE A GOOD CLAM CHOWDER
YOU CAN SPEND DAYS IN THESE STORES FINDING SOMETHING NEW ALL THE TIME
IN A RESTAURANT ONE EVENING A NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN WERE SEATED CONSPICUOUSLY AT A TABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
DRY AND OF MAGNIFICENT BOUQUET
CHATEAU LATOUR BLANCHE
THEN CAME THE SOUP WHICH WE EXPERIENCED ONES ALWAYS PASSED OVER
TO SPEAK OF BOHEMIAN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAY NOTHING OF THE OLD HOFFMAN SALOON ON SECOND AND MARKET STREETS WOULD BE LIKE THE PLAY OF HAMLET WITH HAMLET LEFT OUT
WE ASKED HIM WHOM TO TIP AND HOW MUCH TO GIVE AND HE GOT US OUT OF OUR DIFFICULTY AND WE FOUND THAT THE TIPS AMOUNTED TO ABOUT AS MUCH FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK AS WE HAD BEEN HELD UP FOR IN ONE DAY AT THE WALDORF-ASTORIA
SOME OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE BOHEMIAN AFFAIRS WE KNOW OF HAVE BEEN FULL DRESS GATHERINGS CAREFULLY PLANNED AND DELIGHTFULLY CARRIED OUT
THE HIGH COST OF LIVING HAS NOT REACHED THIS THRIFTY PEOPLE WITH THEIR INBORN KNOWLEDGE OF THE VALUES OF FOODS
CHRISTIAN GOOD AT WASHINGTON AND KEARNY BIG JOHN AT MERCHANT STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND SANSOME MARSHALL'S CHOP HOUSE IN THE OLD CENTER MARKET AND JOHNSON'S OYSTER HOUSE IN A BASEMENT AT CLAY AND LEIDESDORFF STREETS WERE ALL NOTED PLACES AND MUCH PATRONIZED THE LATTER LAYING THE FOUNDATION OF ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST FAMILIES MARTIN'S WAS MUCH PATRONIZED BY THE OLD COMSTOCK CROWD AND THIS WAS THE FAVORITE DINING PLACE OF THE LATE WILLIAM C
FOLLOW THE RULE OF NEVER DISTURBING A COOKING EGG OR A SLEEPING CHILD
THEN TOO ALL NIGHTS ARE NOT THE SAME AT RESTAURANTS
THAT THIS IS NOT A FACT IS BECAUSE AMONG THE EARLIEST CORNERS TO CALIFORNIA AFTER IT PASSED FROM MEXICAN HANDS TO THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES WERE FRENCH AND ITALIAN COOKS AND THE BON VIVANTS OF BOTH LANDS WHO WANTED THEIR OWN STYLE OF COOKING
WHEN THESE WERE ALL SUPPLIED THE REST OF THE FISH AND CRABS WERE TAKEN UP TO THE WHARF AND PUT ON THE COUNTERS OF THE FREE MARKET WHERE THEY WERE SOLD AT PRICES MOST TEMPTING
THIS IS BEST MIXED IN SHALLOW BOWL OR SOUP PLATE
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT DURING THE MEAL WHICH LASTED FROM SEVEN UNTIL PAST MIDNIGHT SAKI WAS SERVED CONSTANTLY YET NO ONE FELT ITS INFLUENCE IN MORE THAN A SENSE OF INCREASED EXHILARATION
POLENTI FOR THE GRAVY
ITEM--SIX HEARTY APPETITES TO BE APPEASED
YOUR LUNCHEONS AND DINNERS CAN BE GOTTEN IN YOUR ROOMS OR AT THE RESTAURANTS JUST AS YOU ARE INCLINED
THEY WERE UPPER CLASS ITALIANS EXCEEDINGLY POLITE AND APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY FOR INTRUDING UPON US
MIX THE FLOUR AND BUTTER TO A SOFT PASTE WITH A LITTLE CREAM AND STIR IN WITH THE OYSTERS ADDING SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE
WE HAVE HERE THE VERY BEST TEA THIS MAY BE TAKEN AS A SAMPLE OF WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN VISITING CHINATOWN'S RESTAURANTS AND WHILE WE CONFESS TO HAVING SOME EXCELLENT DISHES SERVED US IN CHINATOWN OUR PREFERENCE LIES IN OTHER PATHS OF ENDEAVOR
THESE MEN WERE ALL INDIVIDUALISTS AND THEIR INDIVIDUALISM HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THEIR OFFSPRING TOGETHER WITH INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION
TAKE A QUARTER OF A POUND OF RIPE DARK ROQUEFORT CHEESE AND RUB WITH A PIECE OF BUTTER THE SIZE OF A WALNUT UNTIL SMOOTH ADDING A TEASPOONFUL OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE AND A WINEGLASSFUL OF SHERRY WITH A PINCH OF PAPRIKA RUBBING UNTIL IT IS SMOOTH
SLOWLY STEW THIS IN A LITTLE BEEF STOCK AND A LITTLE MILK STIRRING CONSTANTLY FOR ONE HOUR
TAKE THE LOWLY CORN MEAL FOR INSTANCE
WHEN A FAMILIAR AIR WAS SOUNDED THE ENTIRE GATHERING JOINED IN CHORUS AND WHEN SUCH TUNES AS THERE'LL BE A HOT TIME IN THE OLD TOWN TONIGHT CAME THE PLACE WAS PANDEMONIUM
WITH ENTREES SERVE CLARETS OR OTHER RED WINES SUCH AS SWISS BORDEAUX HUNGARIAN OR ITALIAN WINES
TIE THE ENDS TOGETHER WITH STRIPS OF FINE HUSK AND PUT IN BOILING WATER FOR TWENTY MINUTES
ADD FIVE WINEGLASSFUL OF OLD ALE PLACE OVER THE FIRE AND STIR UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY BLENDED AND MELTED
HERE WAS THE RENDEZVOUS OF SAILOR MEN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR HERE THEY FOUND COMPANIONSHIP AND JOVIALITY
SHRIMPS ALIVE AND ACTIVE CRAYFISH CLAMS SQUID AND SIMILAR SEA FOOD WAS IN PROFUSION AND SOLD AT PRICES ON A PARITY WITH THAT OF THE FISH
BUT TO GET BACK TO OUR TALK ABOUT FISH AND WHERE TO GET IT PREPARED AND COOKED THE BEST
HERE IS ABSOLUTE FREEDOM FROM IRKSOME CONVENTIONALITY OF OTHER PEOPLE AND NONE OF THE NEAR BOHEMIANISM OF SO MANY PLACES CLAIMING THE TITLE
VIN DE GRAVES
AFTER IT IS BURNED OUT YOU HAVE A FINE DESSERT WE BOUGHT THE MACAROONS AND STRAWBERRIES ON THE WAY HOME AND DID NOT EVEN WAIT FOR DINNER TIME TO TRY IT
WE HAVE MADE IT A RULE WHENEVER WE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING NEW ON THE BILL OF FARE TO ORDER IT ON THE THEORY THAT WE ARE WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING ONCE AND IN THIS WAY WE HAVE GREATLY ENLARGED OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD THINGS
THE FULL FLAVOR OF THE CRAWFISH IS BEST OBTAINED IN A BISQUE AND THE BEST RECIPE FOR THIS IS BY THE FAMOUS CHEF FRANCATELLI WHO BOASTS HAVING BEEN THE HEAD OF THE CUISINE OF QUEEN VICTORIA
CHOP FINE ONE ONION AND ONE GREEN PEPPER SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER
IN THE EARLIER DAYS THE GRILLS BOTH THAT FOR GENTLEMEN AND THAT FOR LADIES WERE NOTED FOR THEIR MAGNIFICENT SERVICE AND THEIR WONDERFUL COOKING
IF YOU WISH TO GO BEYOND THESE THERE IS NO LIMIT EXCEPT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE
MIX ALL TOGETHER THOROUGHLY WITH PLENTY OF PEPPER AND SALT AND MAKE INTO A LOAF
WHEN THE REST OF THE STOCK IS BOILING POACH IT IN THE FILLETS OF SAND-DAB THEN REMOVE FROM THE FIRE AND LET GET COLD
THE PUP WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS FROGS LEGS A LA POULETTE
RICARDO HAD BUT ONE EYE BUT HE COULD SEE THE WANTS OF HIS PATRONS MUCH BETTER THAN MANY OF THE LATER DAY WAITERS WHO HAVE TWO
IT WAS SUCH A DINNER AS HAS BEEN ACCORDED TO FEW
IT WAS A TABLE D'HOTE DINNER SERVED WITH A BOTTLE OF DAGO RED FOR FIFTY CENTS
THESE ARE THE RECIPES AS HE WROTE THEM FOR US
BURGANDY MAY ALSO BE SERVED AT ANY OF THE LATER COURSES
NOW YOU LOOK AROUND WITH WIDER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE EYES AND NOW YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THESE STRANGE FOREIGN QUARTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO
MANY A FIT OF ACUTE STOMACH TROUBLE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO SOME FOOD THAT WAS EITHER BAD OR BADLY PREPARED WHEN THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS THE FACT THAT A COCKTAIL HAD BEEN TAKEN JUST PRIOR TO EATING OYSTERS
ONE WOULD MAKE THE SALAD ANOTHER THE MAIN DISH AND OTHERS DO VARIOUS FORMS OF SCULLERY WORK AND IN THE END WE WOULD HAVE A MEAL THAT WOULD OFTEN PUT TO BLUSH THE EFFORTS OF MANY OF THE RENOWNED CHEFS
AT THE GROTTO THERE IS A WONDERFUL VARIETY BUT THE QUANTITY IS AT THE MINIMUM BECAUSE THERE TOO THEY WILL HAVE NO FISH THAT HAS BEEN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OUT OF THE WATER
MUSHROOM SAUCE MINCE THE STALKS OR ANY SPARE PIECES OF MUSHROOMS FINE PUT IN A STEWPAN WITH A LITTLE BROTH SOME CHOPPED PARSLEY YOUNG ONIONS BUTTER AND THE JUICE OF A LEMON OR INSTEAD OF THE LATTER THE YOLK OF AN EGG BEATEN UP IN CREAM
ITEM--TWO CANS OF REED BIRDS FROM CHINA EACH CONTAINING TWELVE OF THE LITTLE BIRDS AS LARGE AS YOUR THUMB
THIS IS THE WAY WE CARRIED OUT THE DINNER EVERYTHING BEING ARRANGED IN ADVANCE
PUT A LAYER OF MACAROONS IN A DISH AND THEN A LAYER OF STRAWBERRIES COVER THESE WITH SUGAR AND THEN ANOTHER LAYER OF MACAROONS AND STRAWBERRIES AND SUGAR UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL YOU WANT
ADD A SMALL BOUQUET OF HERBS AND SIMMER FOR AN HOUR THEN STRAIN
THEY ARE EVERYWHERE AND OF ALL SIZES AND AGES IN SUCH RECKLESS PROFUSION THAT YOU NO LONGER WONDER IF THE WORLD IS TO BE DEPOPULATED THROUGH THE COMING OF THE FAD OF EUGENICS
POSSIBLY THE MOST FAMOUS DISH OF THE OLD PALACE WAS THIS ONE OF OMELET WITH CALIFORNIA OYSTERS AND IT WAS PREPARED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
AFTER A SHORT WAIT DURING WHICH THE SAKI BOTTLES CIRCULATED FREELY ONE OF THE WOMEN CAME IN BEARING ALOFT A LARGE SILVER TRAY ON WHICH REPOSED A MAMMOTH CRAYFISH OR CALIFORNIA LOBSTER
IMPRESS OF MEXICO RUNNING THROUGH ALL THE FABRIC OF SAN FRANCISCO'S HISTORY IS THE THREAD OF MEXICAN AND SPANISH ROMANCE AND TRADITION CARRYING US BACK TO THE VERY DAYS WHEN THE TROOPER SENT OUT BY PORTOLA FIRST SET EYES ON THE GREAT INLAND SEA NOW KNOWN AS SAN FRANCISCO BAY
WHENEVER I GO ANYWHERE I FIND PERSONS IN HUMBLE SITUATIONS WHO SMILE AT ME AND WISH ME WELL
WE HAVE VISITED A NUMBER OF PASTE FACTORIES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE FOUND THEM ALL SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN WITH THE BEST OF MATERIALS IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PASTES
IT WAS BOHEMIA'S SWAN SONG SUNG BY THOSE TO WHOM SAN FRANCISCO HELD MORE THAN PLEASURE--MORE THAN SENTIMENTALITY
CHICKEN SAUTE ITALIAN STYLE WITH GREEN PEAS
WE ASKED BRENTI WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS MOST FAMOUS DISH AND LIKE ALL OTHER PROPRIETORS HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID WITH HANDS EMPHASIZING HIS WORDS
FOG MIST WAS STEALING ALONG THE MARIN SHORE AND HIDING GOLDEN GATE WHEN WE ARRIVED AND THE RAYS OF THE SUN TOOK SOME TIME TO MAKE A CLEAR PATH OUT TO SEA
BOTH THESE DISHES MIGHT BE TERMED GLORIFIED HASH
PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN AT THE OTHER RESTAURANTS MENTIONED BUT ONE CERTAINLY GETS THE BEST THERE IS PREPARED IN THE BEST WAY
HEAT THE BUTTER AND STIR IN WITH THE LOBSTER AND WINE THEN PLACE THIS IN A STEWPAN OR CHAFING DISH AND COOK FOR EIGHT MINUTES
IT IS AS FOLLOWS
BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE GRAND FIESTAS THAT THE FINEST AND MOST PALATABLE DISHES WERE TO BE FOUND
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE ABALONE IS TOUGH AND UNPALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEFT MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHOWDER OR A LA NEWBERG
ROLL THIS TOGETHER AND LAY ON THEM OTHER HUSKS UNTIL THE TAMALE IS OF THE SIZE DESIRED
WHEN DONE DISH IN CLOSE ORDER AND FILL CENTER WITH TOULOUSE RAGOUT AS FOLLOWS
OVER THESE POUR SOME RUM AND SET FIRE TO IT
GOOD AROMA
YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT SO MANY THINGS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IMPORTANT ARE REALLY NOT AT ALL WORTH WHILE
HERE ARE CONGREGATED THE MOST NOTED OF THE LIVELY RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY SAN FRANCISCO
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW BEGINNING TO WAKE UP TO THE FACT THAT THE PREPARATION OF FOOD IS SOMETHING MORE THAN A NECESSARY EVIL AND FROM THE OLD COOKING CLASSES OF OUR COMMON SCHOOLS HAS DEVELOPED THE CLASSES IN DOMESTIC SCIENCE THAT WHICH WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED DRUDGERY NOW BEING ELEVATED TO AN ART AND DIGNIFIED AS A SCIENCE
ROMANEE
ZABAIONE
BROILED SPRING CHICKEN
HAVE READY FIVE TOMATOES STEWED AND PUT IN TWO DOZEN RIPE OLIVES WITH A SMALL CLOVE OF GARLIC MASHED
TO SERVE SLICE ABOUT HALF AN INCH THICK AND FRY IN OLIVE OIL OR BUTTER TO A LIGHT BROWN

THE MUD CLAM IS GOOD FOR CHOWDER BUT NOT SO GOOD AS EITHER OF THE OTHER VARIETIES MENTIONED
AFTER PIERRE'S UNTIMELY DEATH THE RESTAURANT WAS MERGED WITH BERGEZ AND FRANK'S AND IS NOW IN BUSH STREET ABOVE KEARNY
YOU WILL FIND ALL THE STRANGE FOODS AND ALL THE INCONSEQUENTIALS THAT GO TO MAKE THE SUM OF MEXICAN HAPPINESS AND IF YOU CAN GET SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE IN ACQUAINTANCE YOU WILL FIND THAT NOT ONLY WILL THEY TALK FREELY TO YOU BUT THEY WILL TELL YOU THINGS ABOUT MEXICO THAT NOT EVEN THE HEADS OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN WASHINGTON ARE AWARE OF
SAUTERNE
GOOD AROMA AND FLAVOR
ITEM--ONE CASE OF IMPORTED ITALIAN VIN D'ORO SPUMANTI
HERE WAS THE MOST MAGNIFICENT BAR IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IN CONNECTION WAS A RESTAURANT THAT CATERED TO PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY KNEW GOOD THINGS BUT ORDERED THEM
IN PINE STREET ABOVE MONTGOMERY WAS THE VITICULTURAL A RESTAURANT THAT HAD GREAT VOGUE OWING TO THE EXCELLENCE OF ITS COOKING
GO THERE AND YOU WILL LEARN WHY SAN FRANCISCO IS A BOHEMIAN CITY
POP SULLIVAN OR BILLY SULLIVAN ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF FAMILIARITY OF THE ACQUAINTANCE BOASTED OF THE FACT THAT FROM THE DAY THIS PLACE OPENED UNTIL HE SOLD THE DOORS WERE CLOSED BUT ONCE THE KEYS HAVING BEEN THROWN AWAY ON OPENING DAY
PUT THIS PUREE INTO A SOUP POT AND FINISH BY INCORPORATING THEREWITH THE CRAWFISH BUTTER AND SEASON WITH A LITTLE CAYENNE PEPPER AND THE JUICE OF HALF A LEMON
THE RECEPTION ON THE CORNER OF SUTTER AND WEBB STREETS WHICH CONTINUED UP TO THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOTED FOR ITS TERRAPIN SPECIALTIES BUT IT WAS RATHER MALODOROUS AND LADIES WHO PATRONIZED IT USUALLY WENT IN THROUGH THE WEBB STREET ENTRANCE TO KEEP FROM BEING SEEN
OH WE HAVE SO MANY FINE DISHES WE FINALLY GOT HIM TO SELECT THE ONE PRIZED ABOVE ALL OTHERS AND THIS IS WHAT CHEF SCHEILER GAVE US
COOKS ARE RUSHED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY DO NOT GIVE THE CARE TO THEIR PREPARATION THAT THEY TAKE PRIDE IN ON OTHER NIGHTS CONSOLING THEMSELVES FREQUENTLY WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT PATRONS DO NOT KNOW OR APPRECIATE THE HIGHEST FORM OF GASTRONOMIC ART
LAZZARINI UNDERSTANDS THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COOKING AND SOME OF THE DISHES HE PREPARES ARE SO UNUSUAL THAT ONE GOES AGAIN AND AGAIN TO PARTAKE OF THEM
VIN D'ORO SPUMANTI
TAKE A LITTLE OF THAT OIL AND PUT IN ANOTHER PAN WITH A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND AGAIN COOK FISH IN THIS ADDING HALF A GLASS OF DRY WHITE WINE
GO THERE AND YOU WILL FIND THE ROOT OF BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS
OF THESE THERE WERE BUT THREE MODES OF COOKING--FRYING STEWING AND BAKING SOMETIMES BOILING
NOW GO A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE CORNER CROSS THE STREET AND ENTER THE STORE OF THE COSTA BROTHERS
EDWORDS 1914 DEDICATION TO WHOM SHALL I DEDICATE THIS BOOK
THE GOURMET TASTED IT CRIED OUT MACARI TASTED AGAIN THREW OUT HIS ARMS IN DELIGHT AND CRIED MACARONI WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS WONDERFUL DISH YOU HAVE NAMED IT
WHITE AND GOLD PILLARS WITH TWINING IVY REACHING TO THE OLD GOLD AND ROSE MURAL AND CEILING EMBELLISHMENTS SEEM OUT OF PLACE IN A RESTAURANT THAT IS DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CATERING TO LOVERS OF FISH
IS THERE A LAND WHERE THE MAGIC OF THAT NAME HAS NOT BEEN FELT
FILLMORE BECAME THE GREAT BUSINESS STREET OF THE CITY NOW IN ASHES AND HERE WERE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST RESTAURANTS OF ANY PRETENSIONS THE LOUVRE BEING FIRST TO OPEN AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAD THE OLD-TIME APPEARANCE
REMOVE THE MEAT DRAIN AND FRY TO LIGHT BROWN WITH TWO SLICES OF ONION
WITH BOTH THE OMELET AND THE REED BIRDS SERVE VIN D'ORO
MALAGA
A GOOD RULE TO FOLLOW WHEN DINING AT ANY OF THE RESTAURANTS IS
ABALONE'S ARE A UNIVALVE THAT HAS BEEN MUCH IN VOGUE AMONG THE CHINESE BUT HAS SELDOM FOUND PLACE ON THE TABLES OF RESTAURANTS OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY IN PREPARING THEM AS THEY ARE TOUGH AND INSIPID UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
TAKE THE SIMPLE MATTER OF SAUSAGE FOR INSTANCE
BEAT TWO EGGS SEPARATELY AND ADD TO THE CLAMS
FOR THE MUSH
THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLIE'S FASHION THE FIRST IN SUTTER STREET NEAR KEARNY AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SUTTER SERVE WELL-COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH
PUT THE POT OVER THE FIRE AND WHEN THE ONIONS ARE BROWNED STIR IN SOME WHITE WINE OR MARSALA AND THEN PUT IN THE SNAILS
IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ORDER
AND WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN INTO ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES AND SHOWN THE DOUBLE DOORS AND THE MANY CONTRIVANCES USED TO PREVENT POLICE INTERFERENCE WITH THE INNOCENT GAMES OF FAN TAN AND THEN WERE SHOWN THE SECRET UNDERGROUND PASSAGE LEADING FROM ONE OF THE GAMBLING HOUSES TO THE STAGE OF THE GREAT CHINESE THEATRE TWO BLOCKS AWAY THEY WENT HOME READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING TOLD THEM ABOUT THE WAYS THAT ARE DARK AND TRICKS THAT ARE VAIN FOR THEY WERE SURE THE HEATHEN CHINEE WAS PECULIAR CHINESE RESTAURANT LIFE NEVER APPEALED TO BOHEMIANS AND WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ENTERTAIN VISITORS WITH A TRIP TO A CHINATOWN RESTAURANT THE ORDINARY SERVICE WAS OF TEA AND RICE CAKES SERVED FROM LACQUERED TRAYS IN GAUDY ROOMS AND THE ADMIRING VISITORS COULD WELL IMAGINE THEMSELVES IN FAR OFF CATHAY THEN CAME THE FIRE AND CHINATOWN WITH THE REST OF THE DOWN-TOWN PORTION OF SAN FRANCISCO PASSED AWAY
THE TWO FAMOUS AND WORLD-KNOWN DISHES OF THIS CLASS OF COOKING ARE TORTILLAS AND TAMALES
BUT A FEW STEPS AWAY IS THE GREAT FRUIT MARKET OF THE EARLY MORNING AND HERE TONS OF THE FINEST FRUITS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE HUNDREDS OF WAGONS THAT CROWD THE STREET TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT TAKES ALL THE INGENUITY OF EXPERIENCED POLICEMEN TO KEEP CLEARWAY FOR TRAFFIC
FRUIT
FRUIT
ONE GOES THERE ONCE THROUGH CURIOSITY AND FINDS HIMSELF IN A ROOM THAT HAS ALL THE APPEARANCE OF THE INTERIOR OF A BARN WITH CHICKENS AND PIGEONS STRUTTING AROUND HARNESS HANGING ON PEGS AND HAY IN MANGERS AND ALL THE FARMING UTENSILS AROUND TO GIVE IT THE VERISIMILITUDE OF COUNTRY
WALK ALONG THE STREETS ON THE SIDE OF TELEGRAPH HILL AND ONE CAN WELL IMAGINE HIMSELF TRANSPORTED TO A SUNNY HILLSIDE IN ITALY FOR HERE HE HEARS NO OTHER LANGUAGE THAN THAT WHICH CAME FROM THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
DOWN IN WASHINGTON STREET JUST OFF COLUMBUS AVENUE IS THE VESUVIUS AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT OF LOW PRICE BUT EXCELLENT COOKING
COPPA BECAME FINANCIALLY INJURED BY THIS VENTURE AND WAS FORCED TO TAKE A PARTNER IN HIS OLD RESTAURANT AND FINALLY GAVE UP HIS SHARE AND WENT BEYOND THE CITY LIMITS AND OPENED THE POMPEIIAN GARDEN ON THE SAN MATEO ROAD AND THERE WITH HIS HEROIC LITTLE WIFE TRIED TO REBUILD HIS SHRUNKEN FORTUNES LEAVING THE HISTORIC RESTAURANT WITH ITS STRING OF BLACK CATS AND ITS MEMORABLE PICTURES ON THE WALLS TO LESS SKILLED HANDS
CAPTAIN CROPPER AN OLD MARYLANDER HAD A RESTAURANT THAT WAS MUCH PATRONIZED BY GOOD LIVERS AND IN ADDITION TO THE USUAL SOUTHERN DISHES HE SPECIALIZED ON TERRAPIN A LA MARYLAND SENDING BACK TO HIS NATIVE STATE FOR THE FAMOUS DIAMOND-BACK TERRAPIN
IT WAS BUT A FEW HOURS LATER WHEN ALL THAT PART OF THE CITY WAS A MASS OF SEETHING FLAMES AND IN THE RUINS THAT LAY IN THE WAKE OF DEVASTATION WAS THIS MAGNIFICENT HOSTELRY
ONE NEEDS TO SPEND A DAY IN THE ITALIAN QUARTER OF SAN FRANCISCO TO COME TO A FULL REALIZATION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF EVEN THE POOREST ITALIAN FAMILY AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY OF THE BETTER CLASS
LIGHT BREAD HEAVY BREAD GOOD BREAD SOFT BREAD HARD BREAD DELICATE BREAD EACH HAVING ITS ESPECIAL USE AND ALL SATISFYING TO DIFFERENT APPETITES
WE HAD ENTERTAINED ONE OF THE EXPOSITION COMMISSIONERS FROM A SISTER STATE AND HE WAS SO WELL PLEASED WITH WHAT HE HAD LEARNED IN A GASTRONOMIC WAY THAT HE SAID TO US
PUT SIX TABLESPOONFULS OF THE MIXTURE INTO A BOWL AND ADD AN EGG WELL BEATEN
SPAGHETTI OR RAVIOLI
IN CALIFORNIA STREET JUST BELOW DUPONT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSE BOASTED A GREAT CHEF IN THE PERSON OF JOHN SOMALI WHO IN LATER YEARS OPENED THE MAISON RICHE A FAMOUS RESTAURANT THAT WENT OUT OF EXISTENCE IN THE FIRE OF 1906
IF YOU WISH FISH IN ANY WAY OR OF ANY KIND YOU WILL MAKE NO MISTAKE IN ASKING FOR IT AT ANY OF THE FRENCH OR ITALIAN RESTAURANTS OR AT THE SHELL FISH GROTTO AND IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT REGARDING WHAT TO ORDER JUST TAKE THE PROPRIETOR INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE TELL HIM YOU ARE A STRANGER IN THE CITY AND ASK HIM TO SERVE YOU FISH THE BEST WAY HE PREPARES IT
SLICE AND SERVE WITH THE SAUCE OVER IT
MEXICAN RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE A DELUSION AND UNSATISFACTORY
OYSTERS A LA POULETTE ONE-HALF CUP BUTTER THREE TABLESPOONS FLOUR YOLKS OF THREE EGGS
TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE BUON GUSTO IN BROADWAY
HERE YOU WILL SEE THE MAKING OF RAVIOLIS BY THE HUNDRED AT A TIME
WHILE THIS IS TRUE IT IS WELL TO BE ABLE TO ORDER YOUR DINNER FOR IT FREQUENTLY OCCURS THAT ONE DOES NOT CARE TO GO THROUGH THE HEAVY COURSE DINNER PROVIDED TABLE D'HOTE
WHAT IS THE LIMIT OF PRICE AND HOW MANY WILL BE IN THE PARTY JUST SIX
PUT IN TWO OUNCES OF UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE AND MELT OVER HOT WATER
THE CURIOSITY OF THE TOURIST IS AN AVAILABLE ASSET TO CHINATOWN AND WITH QUEER HOUSES AND QUEERER ARTICLES ON SALE THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF UNINITIATED TO KEEP THE GUIDES BUSY BUT FROM A CITY OF MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND ORIENTALS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENLIGHTENED CITY--AN ASIATIC CITY THAT HAD ITS OWN LAWS AND EXECUTED ITS CRIMINALS WITH THE MOST UTTER DISREGARD FOR AMERICAN LAWS IT HAS CHANGED INTO ONE OF THE MOST LAW-ABIDING PARTS OF THE GREAT CITY
IT WAS SUNDAY NIGHT AND THE PLACE WAS STEVE SANGUINETTI'S WITH ROISTERERS IN FULL SWING AND EVERY TABLE FILLED AND DOZENS OF PATRONS WAITING ALONG THE WALLS READY TO TAKE EACH SEAT AS IT WAS EMPTIED
PROBABLY STEVE DID NOT WANT IT WASTED
SPANISH RICE SLICE TOGETHER THREE GOOD-SIZED ONIONS AND THREE SMALL GREEN PEPPERS
IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS CONDITION BORN ON THE SLOPES OF TELEGRAPH HILL THAT WE ARE DRAWN OUT OF DEPRESSING INFLUENCES OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND FIND A WORLD OF PLEASURE INNOCENT AND EDUCATIONAL THE INSPIRATION FOR WHICH HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS OF LATINA SINCE THE DAYS OF EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE WHICH INSPIRATION IS STILL A POWER FOR GOOD BECAUSE IT TAKES PEOPLE OUT OF THEMSELVES AND PLACES THEM WHERE THEY CAN LOOK WITH UNDERSTANDING AND SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF PERCEPTION
AMONG THE PRE-FIRE RESTAURANTS OF NOTE WERE SEVERAL ITALIAN PLACES WHICH APPEALED TO THE BOHEMIAN SPIRIT THROUGH THEIR GOOD COOKING AND ABSENCE OF CONVENTIONALITY TOGETHER WITH THE INEXPENSIVENESS OF THE DINNERS
WHEN DONE TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE SAUCE
SEE HERE IS A WINDOW FULL OF BREAD
BAB'S HAD A METEORIC CAREER AND WAS WORTHY OF MUCH LONGER LIFE BUT BABCOCK HAD TOO HIGH AN IDEALIZATION OF WHAT SAN FRANCISCO WANTED
SHRIMPS AND CRABS WERE THEN SO PLENTIFUL THAT THEIR PRICE WAS NEVER CONSIDERED
OF THESE CAMPI'S IN CLAY STREET BELOW SANSOME WAS THE MOST NOTED AND THE PRIMITIVE STYLE OF SERVING COMBINED WITH HIS EXCELLENT COOKING BROUGHT HIM FAME
COOK UNTIL MIXTURE FORMS A SOFT BALL WHEN TESTED IN COLD WATER
IN OUR JUDGMENT THE WORD COMES FROM THE FRENCH BON HOMME FOR SURELY THE BOHEMIAN IS A GOOD MAN WHATEVER MAY BE THE DERIVATION THE FACT REMAINS THAT NOT TO ALL IS GIVEN THE PERCEPTION TO UNDERSTAND NOR THE EYES TO SEE AND THEREIN LIES ONE OF THE DANGERS OF WRITING SUCH A BOOK AS THIS
FOURTEEN OF THEM IN ALL FROM THE LONG STICKS OF GRISSINI TO THE GREAT SLID LOAVES WEIGHING MANY POUNDS
AND WHY SHOULD SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ACHIEVED THIS DISTINCTION IN THE MINDS OF THE GOURMETS
ROLL TWO SLICES OF DRIED BREAD TO CRUMBS AND MIX WITH THE BEATEN EGGS
CLARET
GERMAN WINES ARE OF LIGHTER CHARACTER AND ARE GENERALLY TERMED RHEIN WINES
DINING IS AN ART AND ITS PLEASURE IS GREATLY ENHANCED BY A KNOWLEDGE OF FOODS COOKING SERVING NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND COMBINATIONS OF BOTH FOODS AND WINES
IN FACT THE PASTE THAT COMES FROM ITALY IS NEITHER SO GOOD IN TASTE NOR IS IT SO CLEAN IN THE MAKING
PUT IN THE OVEN AND BROWN TO A GOLDEN COLOR
COLOR WITH THE CATSUP AND SEASON WITH PAPRIKA AND CHILI POWDER
STIR THIS CONSTANTLY UNTIL IT BOILS THEN ADD A TRUFFLE TWO DOZEN MUSHROOMS CHOPPED FINE A DASH OF WHITE PEPPER AND THEN THE DICE OF CHICKEN
PUT THE MIXTURE INTO THE SHELL OF THE COCOANUT USING THE CUT-OFF TOP AS A COVER AND CLOSE TIGHTLY WITH A COVERING OF PASTE AROUND THE JOINTURE TO KEEP IN THE FLAVORS
WHEN READY TO COOK ROLL THEM IN BREAD CRUMBS AND FRY IN OLIVE OIL
ZABAIONE BEAT TOGETHER HARD FOR SIX MINUTES SIX EGGS AND FOUR TEASPOONFULS OF POWDERED SUGAR IN A DOUBLE BOILER AND PLACE OVER A GENTLE FIRE NEVER CEASING TO WHIP UNTIL THE CONTENTS BECOME STIFF ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN A COFFEE SPOON UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
TO THE PRESENT LET BOHEMIA BOW
SPANISH MODE OF COOKING RICE IS SAVORY AND MOST PALATABLE AND MRS VALLEJO'S RECIPE FOR THIS IS AS FOLLOWS
THAT WILL INCLUDE THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE YOU TWO AND MYSELF AND WIFE
BETWEEN ARE DINNERS TO SUIT ALL TASTES AND POCKETBOOKS
IT IS OFFENSIVE TO SENSITIVE NOSTRILS AND VITIATES THE TASTE WHEN THUS USED BUT WHEN PROPERLY ADDED TO CERTAIN FOODS IT GIVES AN INTANGIBLE FLAVOR WHICH NEVER FAILS TO ELICIT PRAISE
ORDINARILY WE KNOW OF BUT THREE KINDS--PORK SAUSAGE FRANKFURTER AND BOLOGNA--NEITHER VERY APPETIZING OR APPEALING EXCEPT SOMETIMES THE PORK SAUSAGE FOR BREAKFAST
IT IS A BIG GROCERY STORE AND WHILE YOU WILL NOT FIND THE SAUSAGE AND MYSTIFYING MASS OF FOOD PRODUCTS IN SUCH LAVISH DISPLAY AND PROFUSENESS AS IN THE PREVIOUS PLACE IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU WILL FIND THIS EVEN MORE INTERESTING FOR IT IS ON A DIFFERENT PLANE
PUT IN CHOPPING BOWL AND CHOP NOT TOO FINE
SOME PASS IT BY EVERY DAY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT
MAMA KNOWS NOTHING BUT COOKING AND GOING TO CHURCH
THEN CAME A SERVICE OF SOUP FOR WHICH THIS RESTAURANT IS FAMOUS FOLLOWED BY A COMBINATION SALAD WITH WHICH WAS SERVED A BOTTLE OF PONTET CANET
SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIA LAYS NO CLAIM TO PERSUASIVE FRUIT BUT IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN ONE BREATHES IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS MYTHICAL WORLD IT LEAVES AN UNREST THAT IS ONLY APPEASED BY A RETURN TO WHERE THE WHISPERING WINDS TELL OF ENCHANTED LAND WHERE YOU GET THE BEST THERE IS TO EAT SERVED IN A MANNER THAT ENHANCES ITS FLAVOR AND ESTABLISHES IT FOREVER IN YOUR MEMORY APPENDIX HOW TO SERVE WINES A FEW HINTS REGARDING THE PROPER SERVING OF WINES MAY NOT BE AMISS AND WE GIVE YOU HERE THE CONSENSUS OP OPINION OF THE MOST NOTED GOURMETS WHO HAVE MADE A STUDY OF THE BEST RESULTS FROM COMBINATIONS
YOU SEE NEW CANNED GOODS
PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND A CLERK WHO CAN SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH BUT IF YOU CANNOT EITHER OF THE COSTA BROTHERS WILL BE GLAD TO SHOW YOU THE COURTESY OF ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
WHEN THE CRY OF GOLD RANG AROUND THE WORLD ADVENTUROUS WANDERERS OF ALL LANDS ANSWERED THE CALL AND DURING THE YEAR FOLLOWING MARSHALL'S DISCOVERY TWO THOUSAND SHIPS SAILED INTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY MANY TO BE ABANDONED ON THE BEACH BY THE GOLD-MAD THRONG AND IT WAS IN SOME OF THESE DESERTED SAILING VESSELS THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S RESTAURANT LIFE HAD ITS INCEPTION
OVER THE FILLET MIGNON POUR STUFFED PIMENTOES COVERED WITH A SAUCE MADE OF FRESH MUSHROOMS SAUTEED SEC OVER WHICH HAS BEEN POURED A LITTLE CHATEAUBRIAND SAUCE
GARNISH THE BOWL WITH PARSLEY AND IN THE CENTER PUT HARD BOILED EGGS STUFFED WITH CAPERS
THIS IS NOT SO DIFFICULT AS IT APPEARS WHEN YOU ARE READING IT AND IF YOU WISH TO HAVE SOMETHING EXTRA FINE TAKE THE NECESSARY TIME AND PATIENCE AND PREPARE IT
TO THE STREETS RUNNING UP FROM COLUMBUS AVENUE UNTIL THEY ARE SO STEEP THAT ONLY GOATS AND BABIES CAN PLAY ON THEM WITH SAFETY
IN ORDINARY UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE AMERICAN COOKING AND FOREIGN COOKING AND TO ONE ACCUSTOMED TO PLAIN AMERICAN COOKING ALL VARIANTS AND ALL ADDITIONS OF SPICES HERBS OR UNUSUAL CONDIMENTS IS CLASSED UNDER THE HEAD OF FOREIGN
IN THE FRENCH STORES YOU WILL FIND PRESERVED COCKSCOMBS SNAILS MARVELOUS BLOOD SAUSAGES WITH NUTS IN THEM RARE CHEESES PREPARED MEATS IN JELLIES AND HUNDREDS OF DELICACIES UNKNOWN TO YOU
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
ONE CANNOT WELL SPEAK OF THE BARBARY COAST WITHOUT BRINGING INTO CONSIDERATION THE SOCIAL EVIL FOR HERE WAS CONCENTRATED DOZENS OF THE POOR UNFORTUNATES OF THE UNDERWORLD COMPELLED TO EKE OUT MISERABLE EXISTENCE THROUGH PLAYING ON THE FOIBLES AND VANITIES OF MEN OR SEEK OBLIVION IN A SUICIDE'S GRAVE
JOHANNISBERGER SCHLOSS
PATE DE FOIE GRAS--TRUFFLES ON TOAST
SOME ITALIAN RESTAURANTS IS EVERYBODY HAPPY
BREAKFAST OVER THE FISHERMEN TURNED TO THE EXPECTANT CROWD AND BEGAN TAKING NOTICE OF THE PITIFUL OFFERINGS OF COIN
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND A LITTLE SUGAR TO TASTE
THE ORIGINAL MARCHAND BEGAN BUSINESS IN A LITTLE ROOM IN DUPONT STREET BETWEEN JACKSON AND WASHINGTON WHICH DISTRICT AT THAT TIME HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN OVER TO THE CHINESE AND HE COOKED OVER A CHARCOAL BRAZIER IN HIS WINDOW IN VIEW OF PASSING PEOPLE WHO WERE ATTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY AND RETAINED BY THE GOOD COOKING
GARLIC FOR INSTANCE IS A FLAVOR AND NOT A FOOD YET MANY OF THE LOWER CLASS FOREIGNERS EAT IT ON BREAD MAKING A MEAL OF DARK BREAD GARLIC AND RED WINE
THE COOKING IS GOOD AND THE VARIETY WHAT THE MARKET AFFORDS
TAGLIARINI TORTILINI MACARONI SPAGHETTI CAPELLINI PERCATELLI TAGLIATELLI AND ALL THE SEVENTY AND TWO OTHER VARIETIES
THIS AGGREGATION OF CUISINAIRE GATHERED WHERE IS TO BE FOUND A MOST WONDERFUL VARIETY OF FOOD PRODUCTS IN HIGHEST STATE OF EXCELLENCE HAS MADE SAN FRANCISCO THE MECCA FOR LOVERS OF GUSTATORY DELIGHTS AND THIS IS WHY THE NAME OF SAN FRANCISCO IS KNOWN WHEREVER MEN AND WOMEN SIT AT TABLE
IN DEFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT ALL BUT OUR JAPANESE FRIEND WERE UNACCUSTOMED TO CHOPSTICKS FORKS WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AS WELL AS THE LITTLE STICKS THAT THE ORIENTALS USE SO DEFTLY
FREDERICK WISHED SOME BREAD AND HIS CHEF SENT HIM IN A LOAF THAT WAS OF UNUSUAL COLOR AND FLAVOR
HE EMULATED THE PARISIAN RESTAURANTS IN ODDITIES ONE OF HIS ROOMS BEING PATTERNED AFTER THE FAMOUS CABARET DE LA MORT AND ONE DINED OFF A COFFIN AND WAS LIGHTED BY GREEN COLORED TAPERS AFFIXED TO SKULLS
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF RECIPES FOR COOKING THE VARIOUS PASTES AND EACH ONE IS SAID TO BE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE OTHERS IF YOU CAN IMAGINE SUCH A THING
MAKE THE FOLLOWING MIXTURE AND SPREAD OVER EACH FILLET OF SOLE
THE PLACE WAS PATRONIZED ALMOST SOLELY BY THE ITALIAN FISHERMEN WHO NOT ONLY KNOW HOW TO CATCH A FISH BUT HOW IT OUGHT TO BE COOKED
WITH ROASTS SERVE CHAMPAGNE OR ANY OF THE SPARKLING WINES
ADD TO THESE ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC MASHED ONE MEDIUM-SIZED ONION CHOPPED FINE ADD BREAD CRUMBS SUFFICIENT TO STIFFEN THE MASS CHOPPED PARSLEY CELERY AND HERBS TO TASTE
THE RIGHT WAY ONE OFTEN WONDERS HOW CERTAIN DISHES ARE COOKED AND WE SHALL TELL YOU THE RIGHT WAY IT IS HOPED THAT WHEN YOU READ WHAT IS HEREIN WRITTEN SOME OF OUR PLEASURE MAY BE IMPARTED TO YOU AND WITH THIS HOPE THE STORY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIANISM IS PRESENTED
UNCLE TOM'S CABIN TONY OAKES THE HERMITAGE AND CORNELIUS STAGG'S WERE NOTED ROAD-HOUSES WHERE FINE MEALS WERE SERVED BUT THESE ARE SCARCELY TO BE CONSIDERED AS SAN FRANCISCO BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS
WHEN COOL REMOVE THE MEAT FROM THE BONES REJECTING THE SKIN
TO THE BON VIVANT THE GRILLS OF THE PALACE HOTEL CONTAINED MORE TO ENHANCE THE JOY OF LIVING THAN ANYWHERE ELSE AND HERE THE CHEFS PRIDED THEMSELVES WITH PROVIDING THE BEST IN THE LAND PREPARED IN SUCH PERFECT WAYS AS TO MAKE A MEAL AT THE PALACE THE PERFECTION OF GASTRONOMIC ART
AUGUST IS THE PRIDE OF THE HEIDELBERG INN AT 35 ELLIS STREET
WHEN DONE PUT IN A SOUP TUREEN AND SERVE
JULE IS ONE OF THE NOTED RESTAURATEURS OF THE CITY HAVING ATTAINED HIGH CELEBRITY BEFORE THE FIRE
HAVE READY A PILE OF THE SOFT INNER HUSKS OF GREEN CORN AND ON EACH HUSK SPREAD A LUMP OF DOUGH THE SIZE OF A WALNUT INTO A FLAT CAKE COVERING THE HUSK
ACCORDING TO THE PURISTS HERE YOUTH OF BOTH SEXES WAS DEBAUCHED LOSING BOTH MONEY AND SOULS
MOST FAMOUS OF ALL THE OLD OYSTER HOUSES WAS MANNINGS AT THE CORNER OF PINE AND WEBB STREETS
AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED IN THE OLD FIOR D'ITALIA WELL ILLUSTRATES THIS SPIRIT OF CAMARADERIE AS IT SHOWS THE GOOD-FELLOWSHIP THAT THEN OBTAINED
THE PACIFIC CRAB IS PECULIAR AND WHILE IT HAS NOT THE GIGANTIC CLAWS SUCH AS ARE TO BE SEEN ON THOSE IN THE PARISIAN AND LONDON MARKETS ITS MEAT IS MUCH MORE DELICATE IN FLAVOR AND THE DISHES OF CRAB PREPARED BY ARTISTS OF THE GASTRONOMIC PROFESSION IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE MORE SAVORY THAN THOSE FOUND ELSEWHERE
FISHERMEN'S WHARF IS WHERE THE INDEPENDENT FISHERMEN BRING THEIR CATCHES TO SAN FRANCISCO BUT IT IS NOT WHERE THE CITY'S GREAT SUPPLY COMES IN
THEY TURNED THEIR STEPS OUT TOWARD THE PRESIDIO HUNTED AMONG THE ITALIAN REFUGEES AND THERE FOUND COPPA--HE OF THE WONDERFUL BLACK CATS AND IT TOOK LITTLE PERSUASION TO INDUCE HIM TO GO BACK TO HIS RUINED RESTAURANT AND PREPARE A DINNER SUCH AS HAD MADE HIS PLACE FAMOUS AMONG ARTISTS WRITERS AND OTHER BOHEMIANS IN THE DAYS WHEN SAN FRANCISCO WAS CARE-FREE AND HELD HER ARMS WIDE OPEN IN WELCOME TO ALL THE WORLD
MIX ALL WELL TOGETHER IN A BOWL AND ADD MAYONNAISE SAUCE AND A LITTLE WHIPPED CREAM
THIS DINNER INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM THE AUTOMOBILE TO THE TIPS COST BUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE IN THE PARTY
THE DIFFERENCE IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE OF CHEAP BEEF OR MUTTON AND THE DEARER CHICKEN
CHATEAU GRILLE
THE INGREDIENTS ARE SO NUMEROUS AND SO VARIED WITH OCCASION THAT ONE IS TEMPTED TO IMAGINE THEM MADE OF THE TABLE LEAVINGS AND THAT IS NOT AT ALL PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE
ALL LENDING ALMOST MYSTIC CHARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING QUEER LITTLE RESTAURANTS WHERE RARE DISHES ARE SERVED AND WHERE ONE FEELS THAT HE IS IN FOREIGN LAND EVEN THOUGH HE BE IN THE CENTER OF A HIGH REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN CITY
HERE THEY EVEN AS WE WERE TAUGHT SOMETHING OF THE ART OF COOKING
AFTER BEING ON VIEW FOR A FEW MINUTES IT WAS REMOVED AND SOON THE HANDMAIDENS APPEARED WITH THINLY SLICED RAW FISH SERVED WITH SOY SAUCE
THIS RESTAURANT BOASTS A GOOD CHEF AND THE FOOD IS THE FINEST THE MARKET AFFORDS
RECENTLY THERE CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH HIS WIFE AN ACTOR WHOSE NAME USED TO BE ALMOST A HOUSEHOLD WORD AMONG THEATER-GOERS AND WHEN WE SAY THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER ALL YOU OLD TIMERS WILL KNOW WHOM WE MEAN
THEN ADD THREE CHICKEN LIVERS WHICH HAVE BEEN CHOPPED SMALL AND FRIED ONE SLICED TRUFFLE ONE RED PEPPER CHOPPED FINE AND A LITTLE PARMESAN CHEESE
WELSH RAREBIT TAKE ONE POUND OF MILD AMERICAN CHEESE AND PUT IN SAUCEPAN
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNTRY TO SEE WINE MAKING
THEY COMBINE KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD VALUES WITH THE ART OF PREPARATION AND HAVE A RESULTANT MEAL THAT IS TASTY FULL FLAVORED AND NOURISHING AT A MINIMUM OF EXPENSE
THIS IS OUR SUGGESTION
IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE GREAT VARIETY COMES FROM INDIVIDUAL TASTES IN CUTTING OR ROLLING
THERE IS NO GREATER POSSIBILITY OF INTEREST THAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE STORES OF SAN FRANCISCO'S LATIN QUARTER AND WE MEAN BY THIS THE STORES THAT CATER TO THE PEOPLE OF THE QUARTER
THE SAME SPIRIT HAS CARRIED THE HOTEL THROUGH STRESS OF STORM AND IT STANDS NOW ALMOST AS A MONUMENT TO THE ENERGY OF JAMES WOODS ITS MANAGER
OUT OF THE BANK OF WHITE CAME GLIDING THE HEAVY POWER BOATS OF THE SICILIAN AND CORSICAN FISHERMEN WHILE FROM OFF SHORE WERE THE GHOSTLY LATEEN RIGGED BOATS OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN FISHING UP THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS THEIR YARDS ASLANT TO CATCH THE FAINT MORNING BREEZE
IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A FACT THAT IN BARBARY COAST VICE FLAUNTED ITSELF IN RECKLESS ABANDON BEFORE THE EYES OF THE WORLD SHOWING THOSE THINGS USUALLY CONCEALED BEHIND WALLS AND UNDER COVER OF THE DARKNESS
SEVEN KINDS OF FISH
WHETHER IT BE IN THE MAGNIFICENT WHITE AND GOLD DINING ROOM OR THE OLD TAPESTRY ROOM THAT HAS BEEN REMODELED INTO A DINING ROOM OR IN THE ELECTRIC GRILL BELOW STAIRS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME
ASSORTED FRUITS AND CAKES
WITH WATER LET THIS SIMMER FOR TWO HOURS MAKING A STRONG BROTH WITH A LITTLE VEAL TWO OUNCES OR MORE SLICE AN ONION INTO RINGS WHICH PLACE IN THE BOTTOM OF A STEWPAN WITH AN OUNCE OF BUTTER
PLACE THIS IN AN OVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN SERVE
LOOK CLOSELY AT IT AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT IT IS NOT LIKE THE BREAD YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO
BEFORE BUSINESS IN THE DOWN-TOWN DISTRICT WAS REORGANIZED AND WHILE THE WORK OF REMOVING THE TANGLED MASSES OF DEBRIS WAS STILL IN PROGRESS THE MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO CALLED ITS MEMBERS TOGETHER IN ITS ANNUAL BANQUET AND THIS BANQUET WAS HELD IN THE BASEMENT OF THE HOTEL ST FRANCIS THE CRUMBLING WALLS AND CHARRED AND BLACKENED TIMBERS HIDDEN UNDER A MASS OF BUNTING AND FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
COFFEE ROYAL TAKE OF THE BEST MOCHA COFFEE ONE PART OF THE BEST JAVA COFFEE TWO PARTS
I SHALL GIVE YOU SOLE EDWARD VII
AT FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKS AS IF YOU WERE IN ANY ONE OF THE AMERICAN GROCERY STORES OF DOWN-TOWN BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION REVEALS THE FACT THAT THESE CANNED GOODS AND THESE BOXES AND JARS HOLD PECULIAR FOODS THAT YOU ARE UNACCUSTOMED TO
IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT
OF RICH COLOR AND GOOD FLAVOR
BUT THE TRUE BOHEMIAN HAS A WAY OF FORGETTING TO MEET OBNOXIOUS PERSONAGES AND AS A RULE IS MORE CHOICE IN THE SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES THAN THE VAUNTED 400 WITH THE BOHEMIAN BUT ONE THING COUNTS
THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF GOODNESS IN FISH IS FRESHNESS AND IT IS ALWAYS FRESH IN SAN FRANCISCO MARKETS AND ALSO IN THE RESTAURANTS
WHEN CREAMY AND BOILING HOT DROP IN THE OYSTERS
TAKE SIX EGGS ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA OYSTERS ONE SMALL ONION ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF FLOUR SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE
TO INCREASE THEIR ANIMATION TO BOISTEROUSNESS
PROBABLY THE MOST UNIQUE PLACE OF THE PIONEER AND POST-PIONEER ERAS WAS THE COBWEB PALACE AT MEIGGS'S WHARF RUN BY QUEER OLD ABE WARNER
LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER
HEAT THE OYSTERS IN THEIR OWN LIQUOR TO A BOILING POINT THEN DRAIN AND ADD THE DRESSING MIXING LIGHTLY
PRESERVED VEGETABLES AND FISH AND MEATS IN OIL
YOU SEE STRANGE-LOOKING FLAT HAMS AND ARE TOLD THAT THEY ARE ITALIAN HAMS AND IF YOU BUY SOME YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY CUT THE HAM THE WRONG WAY AND INSTEAD OF SLICING IT ACROSS THE GRAIN THEY CUT IN VERY THIN SLICES DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BONE
HERE THEY HAD THEIR DOMICILE AND HERE THEY FOREGATHERED IN THE LITTLE RESTAURANTS WHOSE CLAIMS TO MERIT LAY CHIEFLY IN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE RARELY VISITED BY OTHER THAN THE ITALIANS OF THE QUARTER AND THESE BOHEMIANS WHO LIVED THERE
WE PRESERVED ONE WRITTEN BY AN UNKNOWN BOHEMIAN
TO ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE IDEA OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIANISM LET US DIVIDE ITS HISTORY INTO FIVE ERAS
A PECULIAR FLAVOR IS GIVEN TO IT THROUGH THE ADDITION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF BURNED WINE
ON TOP OF EACH SUCCESSION OF LAYERS PUT A LITTLE OF THE MIXTURE
SHRIMP CREOLE TAKE THREE PINTS OF UNSHELLED SHRIMPS AND SHELL THEM ONE-HALF PINT OF CREAM TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF BUTTER TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF FLOUR TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF CATSUP ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY PAPRIKA CHILI POWDER AND PARSLEY
THE NUMBER OF KINDS OF PASTE IS MOST ASTONISHING AND ONE WONDERS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY KINDS AND WHAT IS DONE WITH THEM
POUR A TABLESPOONFUL OF OLIVE OIL IN AN OMELET PAN AND IN THIS FRY THE PEPPERS AND ONION TO A LIGHT BROWN
ACCORDING TO ONE OF OUR ITALIAN FRIENDS THE STORY RUNS THIS WAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT THERE ARE SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM THAT OUR ANSWER WAS DIFFICULT BUT WE FINALLY STOPPED AT CHICKEN PORTOLA IT WAS THEN THAT THE OLD SMILE CAME BACK TO COPPA'S FACE
YOU NOW FIND YOURSELF SURROUNDED WITH SAUSAGES FROM FLOOR TO CEILING AND FROM SIDE WALL TO SIDE WALL ON BOTH CEILING AND FLOOR AND SUCH SAUSAGE IT IS
OTHERS WILL PREFER THE MOUNTAIN TROUT
THIS WAS THE CASE WITH US ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE OVER AT 1549 STOCKTON STREET NEAR WASHINGTON SQUARE AT THE GIANDUJA
ON TOP OF THIS PLACE THE BEATEN WHITE OF EGG AND GRATED NUTMEG
FISHERMEN'S WHARF LIES OVER AT NORTH BEACH AT THE END OF MEIGGS'S WHARF WHERE THE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAVE THEIR STATION AND TO REACH IT ONE TAKES EITHER THE POWELL AND NORTH BEACH CARS OR THE KEARNY AND NORTH BEACH CARS AND AT THE END OF EITHER WALKS TWO BLOCKS
OFTEN CHARLIE TELEPHONES US THAT HE HAS DISCOVERED A NEW DISH AND HURRIES US OVER TO PASS JUDGMENT ON IT
AS YOU SIT EITHER IN CURTAINED ALCOVE OR AT THE COMMON TABLE IN THE MAIN ROOM LITTLE ANDREA WILL VISIT YOU WITH HIS CAT
HERE ARE WINES FROM GRAPES GROWN ON THE WARM SLOPES OF VESUVIUS AND BROUGHT TO EARLY PERFECTION BY THE UNDERGROUND FIRES
WE HAVE NOT ROOM TO SHOW THEM ALL IN RESPONSE TO OUR INQUIRY REGARDING THE NUMBER OF KINDS OF PASTE MADE BY ITALIANS HE SAID THERE WERE MORE THAN SEVENTY-FIVE
MINT JULEP BRUISE SEVERAL SPRIGS OF MINT IN A MIXING GLASS WITH PULVERIZED SUGAR
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE CHICKEN DOCTOR
THOSE TO WHOM ONLY THE SURFACE OF THINGS IS VISIBLE ARE PRONE TO EXPRESS WONDER AT THE LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE SAN FRANCISCAN FOR HIS HOME CITY
ADD ONE OUNCE OF BUTTER AND HALF A CUP OF RICH MILK
WE ASKED COPPA WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS BEST DISH AND HE GAVE US THE IRISHMAN'S REPLY BY ASKING ANOTHER QUESTION
SCHWAN THE ELEGANT ART OF DINING BOHEMIAN SAN FRANCISCO ITS RESTAURANTS AND THEIR MOST FAMOUS RECIPES THE ELEGANT ART OF DINING BY CLARENCE E
BOIL UNTIL SOFT AND LET COOL OFF IN ITS OWN BROTH
LATER BLANCO OPENED A FINE RESTAURANT IN MASON STREET BETWEEN TURK AND EDDY REVIVING THE OLD NAME OF THE POODLE DOG AND HERE ALL THE OLD TRADITIONS HAVE BEEN REVIVED
IF YOU READ THIS AND THEN HURRY OFF TO A SPECIFIED RESTAURANT WITH THE EXPECTATION OF FINDING THE BOHEMIAN ATMOSPHERE IN EVIDENCE YOU ARE APT TO BE DISAPPOINTED FOR FREQUENTLY IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE YOUR OWN BOHEMIAN ATMOSPHERE
HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SERVING ADD A CAN OF TOMATOES OR AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF FRESH ONES AND A PINT OF SHRIMPS BOILED AND SHREDDED
AT ALL OF THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN RESTAURANTS SMALL FRY IS COOKED TO PERFECTION
SMALL FISH OR WHITE BAIT WENT BY QUANTITY TEN CENTS SECURING ABOUT HALF A GALLON
HERE WAS THE INSPIRATION OF MANY A GOOD BOOK AND MANY A FAMOUS PICTURE WHOSE INCEPTION CAME FROM THOUGHTS THAT CRYSTALLIZED AMID THESE SURROUNDINGS AND HERE MANY A NEEDY BOHEMIAN STRUGGLED THROUGH THE LEAN DAYS WITH THE HELP OF THESE KIND-HEARTED LATINA
FISH ENTREE ROAST AND DESSERT WERE SERVED IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH THE BLACK COFFEE MA TANTA CHANGED FROM SERVITOR TO HOSTESS AND SAT WITH HER GUESTS AND DISCUSSED THE TOPICS OF THE DAY ON EQUAL TERMS
HOW ABUSED IS THE WORD
GO ALONG BROADWAY WEST OF GRANT AVENUE AND THEN AROUND THE CORNER ON STOCKTON AND YOU WILL SEE STRANGE SIGNS AND PERHAPS YOU WILL NOT KNOW THAT FONDA MEANS RESTAURANT OR THAT TIENDA MEANS A STORE

SERVE ON HOT PLATE WITH A DASH OF PAPRIKA
POP FLOYD RECENTLY KILLED BY HIS BARTENDER IN AN ALTERCATION HAD A PLACE DOWN IN CALIFORNIA STREET MUCH PATRONIZED BY BUSINESS MEN
WHILE WHIPPING ADD THREE WINE-GLASSFULS OF MARSALA AND ONE LIQUEUR GLASS OF MARASCHINO BRANDY
WE BELIEVE THAT EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL SHOULD JUDGE FOR HIM OR HERSELF CONSIDERING OURSELVES FORTUNATE THAT OUR IDEAS AND TASTES ARE HELD IN COMMON
THE POODLE DOG THE PUP DELMONICO'S JACQUES FRANK'S THE MINT BERGEZ FELIX AND CAMPI'S ARE THE CONNECTING LINKS BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE PIONEER DAYS

CHOP THE SWEET PEPPER AND TOMATO FINE AND MIX WITH THEM THE BRUISED AND MASHED GARLIC
FELIX IN MONTGOMERY STREET BETWEEN CLAY AND WASHINGTON AND THE POODLE DOG-BERGEZ-FRANKS IN BUSH STREET BETWEEN KEARNY AND GRANT AVENUE
IT WAS MADE THE RIGHT WAY AND WE ADVISE YOU TO TRY IT FOR IT IS SIMPLE AND LEAVES A MOST DELICIOUS MEMORY
ADD A LITTLE BUTTER AND SALT TO TASTE
DAYLIGHT CAME EARLY AND IT WAS JUST FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN WE BEGAN PREPARATIONS
HERE ARE WINES WHOSE TASTE IS SO DELICIOUS THAT YOU WONDER WHY IT IS THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOT TALKING ABOUT IT AND DRINKING IT
ONE OF THE LITTLE OUT-OF-THE WAY RESTAURANTS OF THE ITALIAN QUARTER IS THE LEON D'ORO AT 1525 GRANT AVENUE AND IT IS ONE OF THE SURPRISES OF THAT DISTRICT
CARRIAGES DROVE DIRECTLY INTO THE BUILDING FROM THE STREET AND THE OCCUPANTS WENT BY ELEVATOR TO SOUNDPROOF ROOMS ABOVE WHERE THEY WERE SERVED BY DISCREET WAITERS
THE KITCHEN WAS PRESIDED OVER BY OLD BILLY JACKSON AN OLD-TIME SOUTHERN DARKEY WHO MADE A SPECIALTY OF FRIED CHICKEN CREAM GRAVY AND CORN FRITTERS
ANOTHER FAVORITE RECIPE OF MRS VALLEJO WAS SPANISH BEEFSTEAK PREPARED AS FOLLOWS
FRITTO MISTO
THE GOVERNOR OF MY STATE IS COMING AND I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE HIM A DINNER THAT WILL OPEN HIS EYES TO SAN FRANCISCO'S POSSIBILITIES
BUT IT FREQUENTLY OCCURRED THAT THE GREAT RULER PERMITTED HIS APPETITE TO OVERCOME HIS JUDGMENT AND HE WOULD EAT SO HEARTILY OF THE FOOD FIRST SET BEFORE HIM THAT WHEN LATER AND MORE DELICIOUS DISHES CAME TO THE TABLE HE WAS UNABLE TO DO THEM JUSTICE
THE PROPRIETOR NOTICED US AND WITH A CHARACTERISTIC SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS SAID
LET STAND FOR TEN MINUTES AND THEN PUT IN A DASH OF JAMAICA RUM
FOR MEAT CHICKEN PORK AND VEAL ARE CONSIDERED THE BEST
AS A FITTING CLIMAX FOR THIS EVENING WE DIRECTED THE CHAUFFEUR TO DRIVE TO THE CLIFF HOUSE WHERE OVER A BOTTLE OF KRUG WE TALKED IT ALL OVER AS WE WATCHED THE DANCING AND LISTENED TO THE SINGING OF THE CABARET PERFORMERS
LACRIMA CHRISTI
THEN ADD A LUMP OF FRESH BUTTER ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND SPRINKLE LIBERALLY WITH GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONING TO TASTE WITH PEPPER AND SALT
MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN GATHERING THIS INFORMATION AND NAUGHT IS WRITTEN IN MALICE NOR THROUGH FAVORITISM OUR EXPRESSIONS OF OPINION BEING UNBIASED BY FAVOR OR COMPENSATION
IN THE FAMILY OF EACH OF THESE SPANISH GRANDEES WERE CULINARY SECRETS KNOWN TO NONE EXCEPT THE SENORA DE LA CASA AND TRANSMITTED BY HER TO HER SONS AND DAUGHTERS
POSSIBLY IT IS BEST EXPLAINED OR EXCUSED WHICHEVER WAY YOU WISH TO CALL IT BY ONE OF GOUVERNEUR MORRIS'S CHARACTERS IN A RECENT STORY WHO SAYS
TAKE FROM THE FIRE
THE COOKING WAS TRULY MEXICAN FOR IT INCLUDED THE USUAL MEXICAN DISREGARD FOR DIRT
BUT AT THAT IT IS NOT A PLEASANT THING TO CONTEMPLATE
PLACE THESE PIECES ON A MEAT BOARD AND SPRINKLE LIBERALLY WITH FLOUR
AT THE CLIFF HOUSE THREE TIMES DESTROYED BY FIRE AND THREE TIMES REBUILT THE CLIFF HOUSE STANDS ON A ROCKY PROMONTORY OVERLOOKING THE SUNDOWN SEA WHERE SAN FRANCISCO'S BEACH IS LAVED BY THE WAVES OF THE OCEAN
WHEN DONE THIS SHOULD BE THICK ENOUGH TO BE EATEN WITH A FORK
ALL ITALIAN RESTAURANTS SERVE FISH WELL
SET AWAY IN COLD PLACE UNTIL NEEDED
HOW YOU COOK IT SAY DA LADY
SOLARI'S CRAB LOUIS TAKE MEAT OF CRAB IN LARGE PIECES AND DRESS WITH THE FOLLOWING
TURN THE CHICKEN UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY BROWNED AND ADD FINELY CHOPPED GREEN PEPPERS
THESE CURIOS WERE PILED INDISCRIMINATELY EVERYWHERE AND THERE WERE BOXES AND BARRELS PILED WITH NO REGARD WHATEVER FOR REGULARITY
TAKE THE FRIED CHICKEN A HAM BONE STRIPPED OF MEAT FOR FLAVOR A TABLESPOONFUL OF CHOPPED THYME OF ROSEMARY TWO BAY LEAVES A SPRIG OF TARRAGON AND BOIL IN FOUR QUARTS OF WATER UNTIL THE MEAT LOOSENS FROM THE BONES
DRAIN THE RICE AND PUT IN A SAUCEPAN ADDING A LITTLE BROTH HALF A CUP AT A TIME TO KEEP FROM BURNING AND ADD STIRRING CONSTANTLY THE OTHER INGREDIENTS COOKING ALL TOGETHER UNTIL THE RICE IS DONE
WE HAVE SO MANY FINE DISHES OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT BUT WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE VERY BEST THERE IS NO ONE THE VERY BEST I COULD GIVE YOU TWO LET IT BE TWO THEN WAS OUR IMMEDIATE REJOINDER AND HERE IS WHAT HE GAVE US AS THE BEST RECIPES OF THE GIANDUJA
STRAIN THIS INTO THE CORN AND COCOANUT AND ADD ONE SPRING CHICKEN CUT IN FOUR PIECES
IT REPRESENTED A GREAT GROTTO UNDER THE OCEAN AND HERE THRONGS GATHERED NIGHTLY TO DANCE AND EAT UNTIL THE POLICE COMMISSIONERS CLOSED ALL OF THESE RESORTS AS WELL AS BARBARY COAST

ADD MORE STOCK AND MILK AND LET COOK SLOWLY FOR ANOTHER HOUR
BY THAT WE DO NOT MEAN THE THIN WATERY STUFF THAT IS SERVED IN MOST OF THE RESTAURANTS AND CALLED CLAM CHOWDER JUST BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE MADE EVERY FRIDAY
HERE IS SERVED A SIX COURSE DINNER FOR FIFTY CENTS AND THE MENU CARD IS TYPICAL OF THIS CLASS OF RESTAURANTS
WE WANTED TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT BUT NOT WHAT MOST AMERICANS THINK IS RIGHT WE WERE AT A HOTEL WHERE ONLY FRENCH WERE USUALLY GUESTS AND IN ORDER TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE TOOK THE PROPRIETOR INTO OUR CONFIDENCE AND EXPLAINED TO HIM OUR DILEMMA
HE OWNED A HORSE NAMED NICHOLAS BUT COMMONLY CALLED NICHO AND WHEN THE CHEF APPEARED BEFORE HIM TO RECEIVE HIS CENSURE FOR SENDING IN DISTASTEFUL BREAD FREDERICK THREW THE LOAF AT HIS HEAD EXCLAIMING BON POUR NICHOL FROM THIS IT RECEIVED ITS NAME WHICH HAS BECOME CORRUPTED TO PUMPERNICKEL AFTER THE DOORS ARE OPEN TO YOU YOU WILL FIND NOT ONLY MANY NEW STORIES BUT YOU WILL LEARN OF CUSTOMS UNUSUAL AND DISCOVER THEIR ORIGIN DATING BACK TO THE DAYS WHOSE HISTORY REMAINS ONLY IN FOLK LORE
HOW DID THEY LIVE WHEN AT HOME THIS IS WHAT WAS SAID TO US ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OLD DAYS AND THE OLD PEOPLE
IT IS JUST THE SAME TO THEM AS IT WAS ACROSS THE OCEAN FOR THEY HEAR THE SAME DIALECT AND HAVE THE SAME CUSTOMS
WHEN WE ORDER A SPECIALLY PREPARED DINNER WITH OUR SUGGESTIONS AS TO ITS COMPOSITION AND SERVICE WE TIP THE HEAD WAITER THE CHEF THE WAITER AND THE BUS BOY
IT SEEMS TO BE A NATURAL THING YET LIKE ALL THINGS IT HAD A BEGINNING AND THIS IS THE WAY IT BEGAN ACCORDING TO A GOOD FRIEND WHO TOLD IT TO US
WE GIVE IT JUST AS IT WAS

ON THE BARBARY COAST MUCH HAS BEEN SAID AND MORE PRINTED REGARDING SAN FRANCISCO'S BARBARY COAST--MUCH OF TRUTH AND MUCH MYTHICAL
PUT IN A LARGE POT A PINT OF VIRGIN OLIVE OIL FOUR LARGE ONIONS AND EIGHT CLOVES OF GARLIC ALL CHOPPED FINE AND A SMALL BUNCH OF PARSLEY CHOPPED FINE
EVEN AT THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE EVERYTHING FOR GRANTED OR TO ACCEPT EVERY SUGGESTION FOR YOU MAY MEET WITH THE ITALIAN VEGETABLE DEALER WHO IS SO EAGER TO PLEASE HIS CUSTOMERS THAT HE PRETENDS A KNOWLEDGE HE DOES NOT POSSESS
TO MIX IT PROPERLY ONE MUST KNOW THE PROPER VALUES OF HERBS AND CONDIMENTS AND THIS RECIPE IS THE RESULT OF MUCH DISCRIMINATING STUDY
NEVER SERVE MORE THAN ONE GLASS OF ANY LIQUEUR
A WINE OF HIGH REPUTE
SINCE ITS CLOSING IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE HAZARDOUS FOR WOMEN TO WALK ALONE AT NIGHT IN THE ONLY LARGE CITY IN THE WORLD THAT ALWAYS HAD THE REPUTATION OF GUARDING ITS WOMANKIND

IF THIS IS NOT SATISFACTORY I CAN GIVE YOU A MEAT OR A SALAD OR A SOUP RECIPE WE CONSIDERED IT SATISFACTORY AND HERE IT IS
STIR THE MIXTURE FIVE MINUTES
CHATEAU MARGAUX
THEY CAME FROM THE FACTORIES CANNERIES SHOPS AND DRAYS AND AFTER A WEEK OF HEART-BREAKING WORK THIS WAS THEIR ONE RELAXATION AND THEY ENJOYED IT TO THE FULL
THE SALAD OF MODERN TABLES WAS REPLACED BY AN ENCHILADA AND THEN CAME EITHER CHILI CON CARNE OR CHILI CON POLLE ACCORDING TO THE DAY OF THE WEEK SUNDAYS HAVING AS THE EXTRA ATTRACTION THE CHILI CON POLLO OR CHICKEN WITH PEPPER
POUR ON THE WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE AND SHERRY JUST BEFORE SERVING
COOK UNTIL SOFT AND THEN ADD THIS TO THE BROTH WITH A FEW DRIED MUSHROOMS
CUT SOME PINEAPPLE AND PIMENTOES INTO DICE
SOME SAY IT IS A NUISANCE AND SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
HERE WERE GARDENERS WHO CAME IN THE DARKNESS OF EARLY MORNING TO SUPPLY HUCKSTERS SMALL TRADERS AND A FEW THRIFTY PEOPLE WHO KNEW OF THE CHEAPNESS AND IN COLUMBO MARKET THEY DROVE THEIR GREAT WAGONS AND DISCHARGED THEIR DAY'S GATHERING OF VEGETABLES OF ALL KINDS
THE EXCUSE MOST FREQUENTLY HEARD IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE RESTAURANT HABIT AND FOR LIVING IN COOPED-UP APARTMENTS IS THAT THE WIFE WANTS TO GET AWAY FROM THE BURDEN OF THE KITCHEN AND DRUDGERY OF HOUSEWORK
IT WILL READILY BE SEEN THAT THE ELEGANT ART OF DINING IN SAN FRANCISCO MEANS MUCH MORE THAN THE SITTING AT TABLE AND PARTAKING OF WHAT IS PUT BEFORE YOU
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS RESTAURANTS OF THE EARLY 70S WAS THE MINT IN COMMERCIAL STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY WHERE THE PRESENT RESTAURANT OF THE SAME NAME IS LOCATED
WE WENT TO THAT RESTAURANT FOR DINNER ONE EVENING AND THE PROPRIETOR KNOWING OUR INTEREST IN HUMAN NATURE STUDIES SHOWED US TO A LITTLE TABLE IN THE BACK PART OF THE ROOM WHERE WE COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW OF ALL THE TABLES
ANDREA SPEAKS ITALIAN SO FLUENTLY AND SO RAPIDLY THAT IT GIVES YOU THE IMPRESSION OF A QUICK RUSHING STREAM OF PURE WATER TUMBLING OVER THE STONES OF A STEEP DECLIVITY
WITH HUNDREDS OF RESTAURANTS TO SELECT FROM EACH SPECIALIZING ON SOME PARTICULAR DISH OR SOME PECULIAR MODE OF PREPARATION ONE OFTEN BECOMES BEWILDERED AND TURNS TO FAMILIAR NAMES ON THE MENU CARD RATHER THAN VENTURE INTO FIELDS THAT ARE NEW OF STRANGE AND RARE DISHES WHOSE UNPRONOUNCEABLE NAMES OF THEMSELVES FREQUENTLY ARE SUFFICIENT TO DISCOURAGE THOSE UNACCUSTOMED TO THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COOKING PRACTICED BY THOSE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SPENT DEVISING MEANS OF TICKLING FASTIDIOUS PALATES OF A CITY OF GOURMETS
WASTE IN PREPARATION IS BUT THE MILDEST FORM OF WASTE
YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
THE BOHEMIAN REQUIRES NO PRESCRIBED RULES FOR HIS OR HER INNATE GENTILITY PREVENTS THOSE THINGS SOCIETY GUARDS AGAINST
WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
AFTER COFFEE SERVE A LIQUEUR
LET US NOW LOOK AT THE MENU OF THE $3.50 DINNER WITHOUT WINE
IT IS REALLY SOMETHING TO ELICIT WONDER WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITIES OF A TABLE D'HOTE DINNER IN SOME OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS
HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL THE ARTICLES OF HOUSEHOLD USE THAT ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE HEART OF MEXICO AND THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS DESPITE THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES
TABLES AND CHAIRS ARE CRUDE IN THE EXTREME AND OLD-TIME LANTERNS ARE USED FOR LIGHTING
IT IS STILL MADE IN THAT MANNER IN THE HEART OF MEXICO AND WE COULD TELL A STORY OF HOW WE SAW THIS DONE ONE NIGHT IN THE MIDST OF A DENSE TROPICAL FOREST WHILE MULETEERS AND MOZAS OF A GREAT CARAVAN SAT AROUND THEIR LITTLE CAMPFIRES WHOSE FITFUL LIGHT SERVED TO INTENSIFY THE WEIRD APPEARANCE OF THE SHADOWS OF THE INDIANS AS THEY PASSED TO AND FRO AMONG THEIR PACKS BUT THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR SUCH STORIES
IT WAS NOTED FOR OYSTERS A LA POULETTE PREPARED AFTER THE FOLLOWING RECIPE
ALL OF THE RESTAURANTS MENTIONED SERVE GOOD TABLE D'HOTE DINNERS GIVING AN ASTONISHING VARIETY OF FOODS FOR THE MONEY AND IT IS ALL COOKED AND SERVED IN A MANNER THAT LEAVES NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
THE USE OF GARLIC SO MUCH DECRIED AS PLEBEIAN IS THE SECRET OF SOME OF THE FINEST DISHES PREPARED BY THE HIGHEST CHEFS
PONTET CANET
FISH IN THEIR VARIETY PROBABLY THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTION ASKED US BY THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO IS
FREDERICK THE GREAT WAS A LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND HIS CHEF TOOK PRIDE IN PROVIDING NEW AND RARE DISHES FOR HIS DELECTATION
IT MATTERS NOT WHETHER YOU TAKE THEIR THIRTY-FIVE CENT LUNCHEON OR ORDER A MOST ELABORATE MEAL YOU WILL FIND THAT THE SERVICE IS JUST WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE
REINA CABOT MIX AT TABLE AND SERVE ON HOT TOASTED BENT'S BISCUIT
OH IT IS ONLY NINE O'CLOCK AND WE'VE GOT ALL NIGHT IT WAS A CLEAR FRESH YOUNG VOICE FULL OF THE JOY OF LIVING AND CAME FROM A YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE CAREFREE AIR SEEMED TO SAY OF HER EXISTENCE AS OF THE NIGHT WE'VE GOT ALL LIFE BEFORE US THE VOICE THE HEALTHFUL FACE AND VIGOROUS FORM THE VERY LIVE AND JOYOUS EXPRESSION WERE ALL SIGNIFICANT OF THE TIME AND PLACE
A SPECIALTY THERE IS FISH WHICH IS ALWAYS BROUGHT FRESH FROM THE NEARBY CLAY STREET MARKET AS ORDERED CONSEQUENTLY IS PERFECT
RISOTTO ALA MILANAISE ONIONS CHOP FINE--MARROW AND LITTLE BUTTER--RICE--SAFFRON--CHICKEN BROTH--WEN COOK ADD FRESH BUTTER AND PARMESAN CHEESE SEASONED WHAT WAS EMBODIED IN THE WORDS WEN COOK WAS THE ESSENTIAL OF THE RECIPE AND HERE IS THE WAY WE GOT IT
PUT TOGETHER THREE TABLESPOONFULS OF CHOPPED COCOANUT MEAT AND TWO EARS OF FRESH GREEN CORN TAKEN FROM THE COB
THAT IT MAY BE PROTECTED FROM VULGARIANS SOCIETY PRESCRIBES CONVENTIONAL RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH LIKE MORALS CHANGE WITH ENVIRONMENT
IT IS ALL PERFECT BECAUSE IT IS MADE PERFECT BY GOOD MANAGEMENT
TOAST TWELVE SQUARE CRACKERS AND ON EACH PLACE TWO REED BIRDS AND SERVE TWO ON EACH OF SIX HOT PLATES
IT WAS SEVERAL STORIES HIGH AND EACH STORY CONTAINED PRIVATE ROOMS
IN EITHER INSTANCE OUR ADVICE IS IF THE WAITER GETS CONFIDENTIAL AND OFFERS HIS ASSISTANCE YOU WILL CERTAINLY MISS SOMETHING IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT HIS GOOD OFFICES
SO WELL WAS THIS PLACE PATRONIZED AND SO EXORBITANT THE PRICES CHARGED THAT TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH WAS NOT CONSIDERED AN IMPOSSIBLE RENTAL
HE IS NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK ITALIAN BUT THAT MAKES NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE WITH HIM FOR HE TALKS WITHOUT EVER EXPECTING AN ANSWER
CHATEAU LAFITTE
SCALLOPS OF SWEETBREAD PARBOIL THE SWEETBREADS AND THEN GLAZE IN REDUCED ALLEMANDE SAUCE
CADENASSO MARTINEZ AND MANY OTHERS KNOW THESE SLOPES AND LOVE THEM
CELERY VICTOR TAKE SIX STALKS OF CELERY WELL WASHED
WITH A WOODEN CORRUGATED MALLET BEAT THE FLOUR INTO THE STEAK
AT SUCH TIMES WAITERS BECOME CARELESS AND SOMETIMES FAMILIAR
NOT ALWAYS IS IT THE ARTISTIC COMBINATION OF FAMOUS CHEF THAT BRINGS GREATEST DELIGHT FOR WE HAVE AS FREQUENTLY HAD PLEASURE OVER A SUPPER OF SOME SIMPLE DISH IN THE ATTIC ROOM OF A GOOD FRIEND
SCRAPPLE TAKE A YOUNG PIG'S HEAD AND BOIL IT UNTIL THE FLESH DROPS FROM THE BONES IN WATER TO WHICH HAS BEEN ADDED TWO GOOD-SIZED ONIONS QUARTERED FIVE BRUISED CLOVES OF GARLIC ONE BAY LEAF SWEET MARJORAM THYME ROSEMARY A LITTLE SAGE SALT AND PEPPER
IT HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DINE
WE DISCOVERED LATER THAT OUR JAPANESE FRIEND WAS OF THE FAMILY OF THE EMPEROR AND WAS HERE ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION
WE HAVE MADE OUR OWN INVESTIGATION AND GIVEN OUR OWN IDEAS
FRITTO MISTO LAMB CHOPS AND BRAINS BREADED--SWEETBREADS--ESCALLOP OF VEAL--FRESH MUSHROOMS--ITALIAN SQUASH WHEN IN SEASON--ASPARAGUS OR CAULIFLOWER FRIED IN FRESH BUTTER--DIPPED IN BEATEN EGGS--LIME JUS FRITTO MISTO MEANS FRIED MIXTURE AND THE RECIPE AS WE FINALLY ELUCIDATED IT IS AS FOLLOWS
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A HARD AND FAST RULE REGARDING HOW MUCH TO GIVE A WAITER
LET SET AND THEN REPEAT
THIS IDEA IS BORN OF THE THOUGHT THAT ALL THINGS FROM EUROPE ARE BETTER THAN THE SAME MADE IN AMERICA
DARBEE IMMEL HAVE CATERED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN OYSTERS FOR MANY YEARS AND AFTER THE FIRE THEY OPENED THE SHELL FISH GROTTO IN O'FARRELL STREET BETWEEN POWELL AND MASON STREETS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW DISTINCTIVE FISH RESTAURANTS OF THE COUNTRY
THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE AND NECESSARY DEBT CONTRACTED TO OPEN THE PLACE WAS TOO MUCH AND THOMPSON HAD TO GIVE UP HIS INTEREST
IN BARBARY COAST WE HAVE SEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL DANCING THAN ON ANY STAGE OR IN THE FAMOUS MOULIN ROUGE OR JARDIN MABILE OF PARIS
IN THE HEART OF ITALY WHAT A RELIEF IT IS SOMETIMES TO HAVE A GOOD WAITER SAY
AH
IT IS ALSO SAID THAT OUR WELL-BELOVED BOHEMIAN RAFAEL WEILL STILL HOLDS MEMORIES OF THE OLD CALIFORNIA HOUSE OF WHICH HE WAS AN HABITUE AND FROM WHOSE EXCELLENT CHEF HE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THE ART AND SCIENCE OF COOKING AS EVIDENCED BY THE BREAKFASTS AND DINNERS WITH WHICH HE REGALES HIS GUESTS AT THE PRESENT DAY
GRILLED MUSHROOMS SKIN AND REMOVE STALKS FROM LARGE FRESH MUSHROOMS AND LAY ON A DISH WITH A LITTLE FINE OLIVE OIL PEPPER AND SALT OVER THEM FOR ONE HOUR
EVERYONE KNOWS THE STAPLE WAYS OF PREPARING OYSTERS AND EVERY CHEF LOOKS UPON THE OYSTER AS THE SOURCE OF NEW FLAVORS IN MANY DISHES BUT TO OUR MIND THE BEST WAY WE HAVE FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS AT A LITTLE RESTAURANT DOWN IN WASHINGTON STREET BEFORE THE FIRE
WHEN READY TO SERVE DECORATE AROUND THE DISH WITH ANY KIND OF SALAD YOU LIKE AND WITH BEETS CAPERS OLIVES AND MARINATED MUSHROOMS
SPRINKLE WITH PARMESAN CHEESE AND PUT SLICES OF LEMON AROUND IT
THESE THREE RECIPES ARE GIVEN BECAUSE THEY ARE SIMPLE AND EASILY PREPARED
ONE OF THE SPECIAL DAINTIES SERVED WERE THE HOFFMAN HOUSE BISCUITS LIGHT AND FLAKY SUCH AS COULD BE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE
CAPRETTO AL FORNO CON INSALLATA
VICE WAS THERE--YES
WITH THE IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING YEARS THE HORDE OF GOLD HUNTERS WAS AUGMENTED BY THOSE WHO BROUGHT NECESSITIES AND LUXURIES TO EXCHANGE FOR THE YELLOW METAL GIVEN UP BY THE STREAMS FLOWING FROM THE MOTHER LODE
IN THE MEXICAN STORES YOU WILL FIND A SAUSAGE THAT GIVES A DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR TO ANYTHING IT IS COOKED WITH AND IT IS WHEN YOU SEE THESE SAUSAGES THAT YOUR EYES BEGIN TO BE OPENED
TAKE THE REMAINDER OF THE CRAWFISH AND ADD THERETO THREE ANCHOVIES WASHED FOR THE PURPOSE AND ALSO THE CRUSTS OF FRENCH ROLLS FRIED TO A LIGHT BROWN COLOR IN BUTTER
ONE OF THE PARTNERS HERE WAS CARL ZINKAND WHO RAN THE OLD ZINKAND'S BEFORE THE FIRE
SERVE ON HOT PLATTER
IN FACT THEIR KNOWLEDGE WAS CONFINED TO THE LEAST HEALTHFUL AND LEAST NUTRITIOUS MODES OF PREPARATION AND COOKING
BUT WITH THE CHANGED CONDITIONS THERE HAS COME A CHANGE IN THE RESTAURANT LIFE OF THE QUARTER AND NOW A NUMBER OF PLACES HAVE BEEN OPENED TO CATER TO AMERICANS AND ON EVERY HAND ONE SEES CHOP SUEY SIGNS AND CHINESE NOODLES IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT ONE SELDOM SEES A CHINAMAN EATING IN THE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO AMERICANS
GRADUALLY POUR BOILING STOCK ON THIS MIXTURE AND SIMMER FOR TEN MINUTES
WE HAVE BEEN GOING THERE FOR YEARS AND STILL RUN ACROSS NEW THINGS
CHABLIS
BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THEIR COOKING IS MUCH ALIKE SO MUCH SO IN FACT AS TO BE INDISTINGUISHABLE EXCEPT BY DIFFERENT NAMES FOR SIMILAR DISHES AND FREQUENTLY THESE ARE THE SAME
DROP TABLESPOONFULS OF THIS MIXTURE INTO HOT FAT TURN AND COOK FOR SUFFICIENT TIME TO COOK THROUGH THEN DRAIN ON BROWN PAPER AND SERVE
ALL WERE NOTED FOR THEIR GOOD DINNERS AND REMARKABLY LOW PRICES
I KNOW THAT YOU SIT BY YOUR COZY FIRE WHEN SHADOWS CROWD THE ROOM AND MY SOUL RESPONDS TO AN OLD DESIRE TO ROAM THROUGH THE VELVETY GLOOM SO STEALTHILY STEALING SOFTLY SHOD MY SPIRIT IS HURRYING THENCE TO THE LURE OF AN ANCIENT MYSTIC GOD WHOSE MAGNET IS INTENSE WHERE I KNOW YOUR SOUL TOO ROAMS IN FUR FOR I HEAR IT CALL WITH A THROATY PURR FROM THE SHADOWY BACKYARD FENCE
THIS IS A MOST DELICIOUS DISH AND CAN BE VARIED BY USING FINELY GROUND MEAT TO STUFF THE PEPPERS INSTEAD OF THE CHEESE
LET US RAISE ON HIGH OUR GLASSES TO ETERNITY--THE EVER-LIVING NOW
BEFORE SERVING ADD A SMALL TABLESPOONFUL OF PURE FRENCH BRANDY TO EACH CUP
FRY TO LIGHT BROWN
OUT OF NOTHING IT IS SURPRISING WHAT A GOOD MEAL YOU CAN GET UP SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE TO EAT LET US GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
EACH DISTINCTIVE AND FULL OF FOREIGN LIFE AND ANIMATION AND EACH BREATHING AN ATMOSPHERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH THE PARENT STOCK CAME
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO ORDER AND DO NOT CARE TO COUNT THE COST WHEN YOU ORDER PROBABLY THE BEST DINNER AT THESE RESTAURANTS CAN BE HAD AT EITHER BLANCO'S OR THE POODLE DOG
FRY THE STEAK IN A PAN WITH OLIVE OIL
TO US THEY WERE THE LAST WORD IN VULGARITY BUT TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PLACE BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD IT WAS SO BOHEMIAN THEY WERE IDEAL AND SHE REMARKED TO HER COMPANION
MAKE A BROWN SAUCE OF ONE-THIRD BEEF BROTH THICKENED WITH MELTED BUTTER AND FLOUR AND TWO-THIRDS TOMATO SAUCE AND POUR THIS OVER THE TAGLIARINI
THE SPECIALTY OF THE HOF BRAU IS ABALONE'S AND THEY HAVE AS A FEATURE THIS SHELL FISH COOKED IN SEVERAL WAYS
ONE COULD GO TO THIS PLACE JUST ON THE THEORY THAT ONE IS WILLING TO TRY ANYTHING ONCE BUT ASIDE FROM ITS PICTURESQUE OLD COUPLE AND ITS DANTESQUE APPEARANCE IT OFFERED NOTHING TO INDUCE A RETURN UNLESS IT WAS TO ENTERTAIN A FRIEND
MANY PEOPLE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO WILL WISH TO CONSERVE THEIR FINANCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THEY WILL WISH TO ENJOY LIFE IN THEIR APARTMENTS
SAUTE THESE IN A FRYING PAN WITH CLARIFIED BUTTER ON A HOT FIRE
THEN ADD SALT PEPPER AND LEMON JUICE
SERVE EITHER HOT OR COLD
THEIR CHOPS WERE ALWAYS FRIED AS THEY KNEW NOTHING OF THE DELICATE FLAVOR IMPARTED BY BROILING
OMELET A LA PERUQUIER TAKE FIVE EGGS AND BEAT UNTIL VERY LIGHT
CHICKEN BROTH WITH ITALIAN PASTE
SOLES WITH WINE TAKE FILLETS OF SOLE AND POUND LIGHTLY WITH BLADE OF KNIFE THEN SOAK THEM TWO HOURS IN BEATEN EGGS SEASONED WITH SALT AND PEPPER
BURGANDY
THE CITY THAT WAS PASSES TIMES CHANGE AND WE CHANGE WITH THEM IS WELL EVIDENCED BY THE RESTAURANT LIFE OF THE PRESENT DAY SAN FRANCISCO
IF THERE IS ANYTHING FUNNIER THAN A GERMAN ORCHESTRA TRYING TO PLAY RAG-TIME MUSIC WE HAVE NEVER HEARD IT
SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF DINING IN SAN FRANCISCO MAY BE UNDERSTOOD WHEN WE TELL YOU OF A PROGRESSIVE DINNER
IN THE EARLY 50S AND 60S THE MOST NOTED PLACES WERE NOT CONSIDERED RESPECTABLE ENOUGH FOR LADIES AND AT RESTAURANTS LIKE THE THREE TREES IN DUPONT JUST ABOVE BUSH STREET LADIES WENT INTO LITTLE PRIVATE ROOMS THROUGH AN ALLEY
WHETHER IT BE IN THE BROAD GLARE OF NOON-DAY SUN OR UNDER THE DAZZLING BLAZE OF MIDNIGHT LIGHTS SAN FRANCISCO EVER HOLDS OUT HER ARMS WIDE IN WELCOME TO THOSE WHO SEE MORE IN LIFE THAN THE DULL ROUTINE OF WORKING EACH DAY IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY GAIN SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE THEM TO WORK AGAIN ON THE MORROW
LUNA'S BROUGHT FAME TO SAN FRANCISCO AND IN MORE THAN ONE NOVEL OF SAN FRANCISCO LIFE IT WAS FEATURED
TAKE ONE PEACH PEELED AND MINCE WITH A DOZEN MACAROONS ADDING THE YOLK OF AN EGG AND HALF AN OUNCE OF SUGAR
WE ASKED ONE OF THE MANAGERS AT THE HANG FAR LOW WHAT HE WOULD ORDER IF HE WISHED TO GET THE BEST DISH PREPARED IN THE RESTAURANT AND HE WAS EVEN MORE EMPHATIC IN HIS SHRUGS THAN THE FRENCH OR ITALIAN MANAGERS
COURTESY UNFAILING GOOD-FELLOWSHIP ALWAYS IN TUNE AND LAVISH HOSPITALITY MARKED THE DAYS OF THE DONS--THOSE WONDERFULLY CONSIDERATE HOSTS WHO ALWAYS PLACED A PILE OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS ON THE TABLE OF THE GUEST CHAMBER IN ORDER THAT NONE MIGHT GO AWAY IN NEED
ONE OF THE BEST OF THE GERMAN WINES
W
GOURMETS SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSE OFFERED SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND IT BECAME A FAMED RESORT
OF THESE THERE IS NO MORE TASTY AND SATISFYING DISH THAN SPANISH EGGS PREPARED AS FOLLOWS
LET IT BE SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND DO NOT LET THE COST INTERFERE
A BREATH OF THE ORIENT SAN FRANCISCO'S WORLD-FAMED CHINATOWN LIKE THE REST OF THE CITY IS CHANGED SINCE THE BIG FIRE AND THE CHINATOWN OF TODAY IS BUT A REMINISCENCE OF THE OLD ORIENTAL CITY THAT WAS SET IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST THRIVING OCCIDENTAL METROPOLIS--THE CITY THAT WAS
AT EACH PLACE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LACQUER TRAY ABOUT TWELVE BY EIGHTEEN INCHES A PAIR OF CHOPSTICKS A FORK AND A TEASPOON
THROUGH THE FOG OF CENTURIES DIM AND DENSE I SOMETIMES SEEM TO SEE THE SHADOWY LINE OF A BACKYARD FENCE AND A FELINE SHAPE OF ME
SOME KNOW NOT THE LANGUAGE THAT ADMITS ENTRANCE
WHAT IS CHINA STYLE
THEN DIP THE CHICKEN INTO WELL-BEATEN EGGS AND COVER WITH BREAD CRUMBS
NOW FOR A LITTLE BOHEMIANISM OF A DIFFERENT SORT
MIX WELL AND ADD THE CREAM AND THEN THE CRAB MEAT
IN FACT MANY OF THE MODERN DANCES THAT HAVE BECOME THE VOGUE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EVEN BEING CARRIED TO EUROPE HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN PACIFIC STREET DANCE HALLS
BOTH OF THESE SAVOR OF THE OLD TYPE OF FRENCH RESTAURANTS CATERING TO A CLASS OF QUIET SPENDERS WHO CAREFULLY GUARD THEIR INDISCRETIONS
WITH THE EXTENSION OF HIS FAME HE FOUND HIS ROOM TOO SMALL AND HE RENTED A COTTAGE AT BUSH AND DUPONT STREET BUT HIS BUSINESS GREW SO RAPIDLY THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO MOVE TO MORE COMMODIOUS QUARTERS AT POST AND DUPONT AND LATER TO A MUCH LARGER PLACE AT GEARY AND STOCKTON WHERE HE ENJOYED GOOD PATRONAGE UNTIL THE FIRE DESTROYED HIS PLACE
HIS DUCKS ARE ALWAYS COOKED SO AS TO ELICIT HIGH PRAISE
BARBARY COAST WAS A PART OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIANISM BECAUSE OF ITS UNCONVENTIONALITY FOR YOU KNOW THERE IS CONVENTIONALITY EVEN IN VICE
IT IS THIS THAT MAKES SAN FRANCISCO THE HOME OF BOHEMIA AND WHETHER IT BE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AS ONE RISES TO GREET THE FIRST GRAY STREAKS OF DAWN OR AS THE SUN DROPS THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE TO ITS OCEAN BED SO SLOWLY THAT IT SEEMS LOTH TO LEAVE
SEVERAL VARIETIES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE MARKETS THE BEST AND RAREST BEING THE LITTLE ROCK CLAMS THAT COME FROM AROUND DRAKE'S BAY JUST ABOVE THE ENTRANCE TO GOLDEN GATE
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN MUCH OF CHINATOWN THAT SAVORED OF BOHEMIANISM BUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE VOGUE FOR VISITORS TO MAKE A TRIP THROUGH ITS MYSTERIOUS ALLEYS PEERING INTO THE FEARSOME DARK DOORWAYS LISTENING TO THE OMINOUS SLAMMING DOORS OF THE CLUBS AND SHUDDERING IN A DELIGHTFUL HORROR AT THE RECUMBENT OPIUM SMOKERS POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THE INDUSTRIOUS GUIDE
WE HAVE GIVEN DINNERS WHERE THE TIPS AMOUNTED TO FULLY HALF AS MUCH AS THE DINNER ITSELF AND WE FELT THAT THIS PART OF THE EXPENSE BROUGHT US THE GREATEST PLEASURE
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN IMMENSE TUREEN OF SOUP HELD ALOFT IN THE HANDS OF MA TANTA AND AGAIN EACH WAS HIS OWN WAITER
IT SPECIALIZED ON BEEFSTEAKS
OF THE OLD MEXICAN RESTAURANTS THOSE OF US WHO CAN LOOK BACK TO THE DAYS OF A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO REMEMBER OLD FELIPE AND MARIA THE MEXICAN COUPLE WHO KEPT THE LITTLE PLACE IN THE ALLEY BACK OF THE OLD COUNTY JAIL OFF BROADWAY
WE ASKED DAUVILLER WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS MOST DELICATE SALAD AND HE GAVE US THIS RECIPE
BUT IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY
HERE HAVE LIVED MANY WHOSE NAMES ARE NOW KNOWN TO FAME AND TO NAME THEM WOULD BE ALMOST LIKE A DIRECTORY OF WORLD RENOWNED ARTISTS AND WRITERS
ONE FOUND ONE'S SELF TALKING AND LAUGHING WITH THE PEOPLE ABOUT AS IF THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS
EACH PERSON MUST USE HIS OR HER OWN JUDGMENT
TAKE TWO CANS OF CHINESE REED BIRDS OPEN THEM AND TAKE THEREFROM THE TWO DOZEN BIRDS CONTAINED THEREIN
YOU THINK THAT SURELY THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE
WITH THE FIRE BOTH OF THE RESTAURANTS WENT OUT OF EXISTENCE AND THE OLD PROPRIETOR OF THE POODLE DOG HAVING DIED PIERRE AND A PARTNER NAMED PON BOUGHT THE PLACE AND FOR A YEAR OR SO AFTER THE FIRE IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST FRENCH RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY
ORDINARILY WE THINK OF ONE--SPAGHETTI--OR POSSIBLY TWO INCLUDING MACARONI
IN A TUREEN PLACE SLICES OF BREAD SPRINKLED WITH TWO TABLESPOONFULS OF PARMESAN CHEESE
SPANISH CHICKEN PIE CUT UP A CHICKEN AND BOIL UNTIL TENDER
THE CASUAL VISITOR CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE ENCHANTMENT THE MYSTERY THE WITCHERY THAT HOLDS ONE
THE GENTLEMAN WHO SAW OUR LIGHT SAW ANOTHER AND RUSHED OFF TO A BARBER SHOP AND GOT FOUR MORE EGGS
ONE EVENING TWO OF OUR YOUNG FRIENDS CAME OVER TO TELL US THEIR SWEET SECRET AND WITH THEM WAS ANOTHER YOUNG LADY
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU DESIRE THE BEST SERVICE AFFORDED IN ANY RESTAURANT DO NOT SELECT SATURDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT BUT IF YOU WILL LAY ASIDE YOUR DESIRE FOR PERSONAL COMFORT IN SERVICE AND WISH TO STUDY CHARACTER THEN TAKE SATURDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT FOR YOUR VISIT
NEVER DRINK ANY HARD LIQUORS SUCH AS WHISKY BRANDY GIN OR COCKTAILS WITH OYSTERS OR CLAMS AS IT IS LIABLE TO UPSET YOU FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
ONE GOOD-SIZED ONION ONE TOMATO ONE SWEET PEPPER ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE TEASPOONFUL OF FLOUR HALF A GLASS OF SHERRY A PINCH OF ROSEMARY ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC PAPRIKA SALT AND MINIONETTE PEPPER
DRAIN AND WIPE DRY AND DUST OVER WITH FLOUR AND SET ASIDE
DO NOT STIR THIS WHILE COOKING AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS BURNING IT SHOULD BE COOKED OVER AN ASBESTOS COVER
ONE WONDERS HOW A FULL COURSE DINNER ENTIRELY OF FISH CAN BE PREPARED BUT IF YOU WILL GO TO THE SHELL FISH GROTTO YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS DONE AND DONE WELL AT THAT
ARRANGE THEM IN AN EARTHENWARE DISH
EVEN NOW WHEN WE GO TO COPPA'S WE HAVE A LITTLE FEELING OF FEAR LEST WE OFFEND HIM BY NOT EATING ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIM THAT WE ARE PLEASED
IT HELD FOR THEM CLOSE-KNIT TIES THAT NOTHING LESS THAN A WORLDSHAKING CATACLYSM COULD SEVER--AND THE CATACLYSM HAD ARRIVED
THE OLD BALDWIN HOTEL WHICH STOOD WHERE THE FLOOD BUILDING NOW STANDS AT THE CORNER OF MARKET AND POWELL AND WHICH WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE SOME FOURTEEN YEARS AGO WAS THE FAVORITE RESORT OF MANY OF THE NOTED MEN OF THE WEST AND THE GRILL HAD THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE BEST IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THAT TIME
THE AUTOMOBILE CARRIED US THEN OVER TO BROADWAY AND AT THE FIOR D'ITALIA OUR TABLE WAS WAITING AND HERE WE WERE SERVED WITH SAND-DABS AU GRATIN AND A SMALL GLASS OF SAUTERNE
HOR D'OUVRES--FOUR KINDS
BROWN THE FLOUR IN THE BUTTER AND ADD THE MILK UNTIL IT IS THICKENED
BRAUNEBERGER
IT IS A WELL RECOGNIZED MEDICAL FACT THAT MUCH OF THE ILLNESS OF AMERICANS ARISES FROM TWO CAUSES IMPROPER FOOD AND IMPROPER EATING METHODS
TO THE BEST OF ALL BOHEMIAN COMRADES MY WIFE
TERRAPIN A LA MARYLAND CUT A TERRAPIN IN SMALL PIECES ABOUT ONE INCH LONG AFTER BOILING IT
THEY ARE LIVELY ALWAYS WITH MUSIC AND GAY THRONGS AND SERVE GOOD FOOD
PREPARE A BATTER MADE AS FOLLOWS
IF YOU ARE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY YOU MIGHT DO AS WE DID ON OUR FIRST TRIP TO PARIS
FIFTY CENTS PAID THE BILL AND A TIP OF FIFTEEN CENTS TO RICARDO MADE HIM AS HAPPY AND AS PROFUSE WITH HIS THANKS AS THE PRESENT DAY WAITER ON RECEIPT OF HALF A DOLLAR
POULET A LA NAPOLI CUT AND TRIM A CHICKEN AS FOR FRICASSEE
TIN BUCKETS NEWSPAPERS BAGS RAGS AND EVEN SCOOPED HANDS WERE HELD DOWN EACH CONTAINING SUCH COIN AS THE OWNER POSSESSED AND IN RETURN CAME BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF FISH
FIRST APPEARED MA TANTA WITH A GREAT BOWL OF SALAD WHICH SHE PASSED AROUND EACH PATRON HELPING HIMSELF
SOAK A DOZEN DRIED MUSHROOMS IN A LITTLE WATER UNTIL SOFT THEN CHOP FINE AND DRAIN
HERE WERE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN JUST RETURNED FROM THEIR VARIOUS PICNICS ACROSS THE BAY TO THEIR ONE GREAT EVENT OF THE WEEK--A SUNDAY DINNER AT SANGUINETTI'S
AS THE DAY WORE ON THE EARLY BUYERS WERE REPLACED BY THOSE WHO KNEW OF THE FREE FISH MARKET AND CAME TO GET GOOD SUPPLIES FOR THEIR MONEY
WHERE DO WE FIND SO MANY STRANGE CHARACTERS AND HAPPENINGS
IN CLASS WITH JOHANNISBERGER
HOW FEW PEOPLE ARE THERE FOR INSTANCE WHO KNOW THAT ONE SHOULD NEVER DRINK ANY HARD LIQUOR LIKE WHISKY BRANDY OR GIN WITH OYSTERS
HE OPENED A RESTAURANT WHICH IMMEDIATELY ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND GAINED GOOD REPUTATION FOR ITS SERVICE AND ITS COOKING
THE SECOND IS
HERE WERE BOARDING-HOUSE KEEPERS UNMISTAKABLE ANYWHERE BOHEMIANS IN HARD LUCK WHO REMEMBERED THAT THEY COULD GET GOOD FOOD HERE AT A MINIMUM OF PRICE AND CAME NOW WHILE ON THE DOWN TURN OF THE WHEEL
IT ALSO SAVES AN EXHIBITION OF IGNORANCE REGARDING THE DISHES FOR IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE WAITER AND HE WILL BRING THE BEST THERE IS ON THE DAY'S MENU AND WILL SERVE IT PROPERLY
ORDINARILY WHEN CHINESE RESTAURANTS ARE MENTIONED BUT TWO DISHES ARE THOUGHT OF--CHOP SUEY AND CHOW MAIN
BUT THE SAME FOOD PREPARED EQUALLY WELL IS TO BE FOUND IN A NUMBER OF LESS PRETENTIOUS PLACES
EVERYONE WHO LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE THE FIRE REMEMBERS RICARDO HE OF THE ONE EYE WHO SERVED SO WELL AT LUNA'S ON VALLEJO AND DUPONT STREETS
THE AMOUNT OF THE TIP IS ALWAYS A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT DEPENDENT UPON THE SERVICE RENDERED AND THE WAY IT IS RENDERED
CUT A YOUNG TURKEY INTO SMALL PIECES AND BOIL WITH SHALLOTS AND SALT
IT IS THE IDEAL METHOD FOR THOSE WHO WISH A GOOD DINNER AND WHO HAVE NOT THE INCLINATION OR THE KNOWLEDGE TO ORDER A SPECIAL DINNER
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE CUISINAIRE MOST INDELIBLY STAMPED ON THE TASTE OF THE OLD SAN FRANCISCAN WOULD THEREFORE BE OF EITHER SPANISH OR MEXICAN ORIGIN
IT IS MUCH AS IF ONE OF OUR BEST RESTAURANTS WERE TO ADVERTISE HASH AS ITS SPECIALTY
IF ONE LIKES NOISE AND DISTRACTION WHILE EATING SUCH PLACES ARE GOOD TO PATRONIZE
YOUR THOUGHTS AT ONCE RUN TO STEAKS AND CHOPS AND FRIED POTATOES
HAVE SEAWEED AND KELP IN PLACE OF IVY AND A FISH NET OR TWO CAUGHT UP IN THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WITH HERE AND THERE A STARFISH OR A CRAB--NOT TOO MANY FOR PROFUSENESS IN THIS SORT OF DECORATION IS AN ABOMINATION
SERVE HOT FROM CHAFING DISH
IF THEY BUT KNEW IT THEIR AFFECTATION AND THEIR IGNORANCE IS THE HALL MARK OF LOW CASTE
WHERE FISH COME IN IT WAS VERY EARLY ONE MORNING
WHERE THEY SERVED FISH AND OYSTERS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THE OWNERS WERE THE CHEFS AND THEY WERE FROM THE ISLAND OF CATALAN OFF THE COAST OF ITALY
A SOUND DELICATE WINE WITH A FLAVOR RESEMBLING RASPBERRY
IT WAS NOTED FOR ITS SOUTHERN COOKING AND WAS THE FAVORITE RESORT OF W
ANOTHER SHELL FISH MUCH IN VOGUE AMONG THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS IS MUSSELS WHICH ARE FOUND TO PERFECTION ALONG THE COAST
IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GET WELL WITHIN THE INNER CIRCLE OF BOHEMIANISM BUT AFTER YOU HAVE ARRIVED YOU HAVE THE PASSWORD AND ALL DOORS ARE OPEN TO YOU
PROPRIETOR AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD ACCOMPANIED US TO THE DOOR WITH MANY BOWS AND GESTICULATIONS WISHING US BEST OF LUCK AND WE WENT BACK TO OUR HOMES IN THE DESOLATED CITY WITH THE FEELING OF HAVING BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FAIRYLAND OF THE ORIENT
THERE IS A GOOD CHEF AND THE PLACE HAS QUITE A VOGUE AMONG LOVERS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT
BUT TO TELL YOU OF ALL THE INTERESTING ARTICLES TO BE FOUND IN THESE ITALIAN AND FRENCH AND MEXICAN STORES WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH AND EVEN THE STOREKEEPERS WOULD BE AT A LOSS FOR WORDS TO EXPLAIN THEM
HERE ARE STORES MARKETS FISH AND VEGETABLE STALLS BAKERIES PASTE FACTORIES SAUSAGE FACTORIES CHEESE FACTORIES WINE PRESSES TORTILLA BAKERIES HOTELS PENSIONS AND RESTAURANTS
HOW DO YOU COOK IT WAS OUR QUESTION
GRATE SEVEN LARGE EARS OF CORN SEASON WITH SALT AND PUT A LAYER IN A GREASED BAKING PAN THEN CHICKEN THEN THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WITH A LITTLE OF THE GRAVY
LOBSTER SERVED COLD WITH MAYONNAISE OR BROILED LIVE LOBSTER ARE MOST FREQUENTLY CALLED FOR AND WHILE THEY ARE BOTH EXCELLENT WE FIND SO MANY OTHER WAYS OF PREPARING THIS CRUSTACEAN THAT WE RARELY TAKE THE COMMON VARIETY OF LOBSTER DISHES INTO CONSIDERATION
OMELET CELESTINE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE BOURGEOISE FRENCH THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM THE PEASANT DISTRICT OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY
I'VE SEEN YOUR EYES WITH A GREENISH GLINT
THESE WERE SPROUTING BEANS LENTILS PEAS AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS WITH WHICH WE WERE UNFAMILIAR
WHEN THIS IS COOKED POUR IT OVER THE LOBSTER AND LET ALL COOK TOGETHER FOR THREE MINUTES
THE HOF BRAU HOWEVER IS LESS DISTINCTIVELY GERMAN AS THE GREATER NUMBER OF ITS PATRONS ARE AMERICANS
PUT A LAYER OF FROZEN CREAM THEN RAISINS CONTINUING UNTIL ALL IS USED
PROBABLY NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT HAS BEEN SO INSTRUMENTAL IN GIVING TO PEOPLE OF OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AN ERRONEOUS IDEA OF SAN FRANCISCO
ALICE FALLSTAFF
THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS PREPARED AT THE OLD PUP RESTAURANT ONE OF THE NOTED RESTAURANTS BEFORE THE FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE CHANGED CONDITIONS
THEIR SPECIALTY WAS CALLED OYSTERS A LA CATALAN AND THEIR RECIPE WHICH IS GIVEN CAN BE PREPARED EXCELLENTLY IN A CHAFING DISH
LET ALL COME TO A BOIL
THE TROUBLE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT IS THAT THE REST OF THE MENU DOES NOT COME UP TO THE FISH STANDARD BUT IF YOU DESIRE A SIMPLE LUNCHEON OF FISH THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO GET IT
SPRING CHICKEN SAUTE
ONE OFTEN WONDERS HOW THE PASTES CAME TO BE SO MANY AND HOW THEY RECEIVED THEIR NAMES
IF OUR FRIENDS THINK OF A NEW STORY THEY SAVE IT UP UNTIL OUR NEXT COMING AND TELL US SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS HAS A BEARING ON BOHEMIA
THERE ARE TWO GOOD METHODS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OF THE FISH OF SAN FRANCISCO
A WONDERFUL VARIETY OF CHEESES
WE MAKE IT A RULE TO WITHHOLD THE TIP FROM A CARELESS OR INCONSIDERATE WAITER AND ALWAYS ADD TO THE TIP A WORD OF COMMENDATION WHEN THERE HAS BEEN EXTRA GOOD SERVICE
SOME OF THESE ARE SO ELABORATE IN THEIR PREPARATION THAT THEY COST EVEN IN THAT INEXPENSIVE PART OF THE CITY SEVENTY CENTS A POUND AND THE VARIETY IS ALMOST AS INFINITE AS THAT OF THE PASTES
TIPPING TO OUR MINDS IS THE OIL THAT MAKES THE WHEELS OF LIFE RUN SMOOTHLY
SEASON TO TASTE AND COOK THE JULIENNE INGREDIENTS WITH SOME OF THE STOCK
ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS WAYS OF PREPARING SHRIMP IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS SHRIMP CREOLE A LA ANTOINE SO NAMED AFTER THE FAMOUS NEW ORLEANS ANTOINE BY A CHEF IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO HAD REGARD FOR THE NEW ORLEANS CATERER
CARAMEL SAUCE BUTTER THE INSIDE OF A SAUCEPAN
CROSS ANOTHER STREET AND YOU ARE IN MEXICO CLOSE NEIGHBOR TO FRANCE
FRY ALL TOGETHER UNTIL THOROUGHLY BROWN WHICH WILL TAKE SOME TIME
SO IT GOES UNTIL ONE FEELS THAT HE HAS BEEN AROUND THE WORLD IN AN AFTERNOON
OF COURSE HE WASHES HIS FEET BEFORE HE GETS INTO THE WINE TUB
SEPARATE THE MEAT FROM THE BONES AND CHOP FINE
FOREWORD NO APOLOGIES ARE OFFERED FOR THIS BOOK
REMEMBER ALSO THAT THE WORLD IS A LOOKING GLASS
WITH THE WELL-KNOWN PRODIGAL AND WASTEFUL HABITS OF AMERICA THE AMERICAN WHO LEARNS THE USE OF HERBS USUALLY MAKES THE INITIAL MISTAKE OF PUTTING IN THE FLAVORING HERBS WITH TOO LAVISH A HAND AND IT IS ONLY AFTER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF PROPER COMBINATIONS IS OBTAINED
MOISTEN ALL WITH HALF A CUP OF WHITE WINE AND SPRINKLE WITH SUGAR
CARE-FREE SAN FRANCISCO
HERE THE FAMED LACRIMA CHRISTI BOTH SPUMANTI AND FRESCO SAID TO BE THE FINEST WINE MADE IN ALL ITALY AND THE SPUMANTI HAVE THE UNUSUAL QUALITY FOR AN ITALIAN WINE OF BEING DRY
BUT SOMETIMES YOU WILL NOT BE TIRED OR YOU WILL WISH TO GET UP A LITTLE LATE SUPPER AFTER THEATRE AND IT IS THEN THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD OF THE OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED BY HAVING YOUR OWN KITCHEN ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT YOU CAN CARRY OUT YOUR TASTES AND COOK SOME OF THE STRANGE AND NEW FOODS THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED IN YOUR RAMBLES THROUGH THE FOREIGN QUARTERS
THE GOOD TRAVELER WANTS TO TIP PROPERLY NEITHER TOO LITTLE NOR TOO MUCH THEREBY GETTING THE BEST SERVICE FOR IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THE PLEASURE OF A TRIP DEPENDS UPON THE SERVICE RECEIVED
WAIT A BIT
WHY SHOULD THEY LEARN ANYTHING ELSE THEY SAY
THE ELDER SONS AND DAUGHTERS ATTENDED TO THE WANTS OF THOSE WHO FANCIED ANY OF THE CURIOS DISPLAYED IN THE LONG SHOWCASE THAT EXTENDED FROM THE DOOR TO THE REAR OF THE ROOM
NOW ADD ONE SCANT CUP OF RICE STIRRING CONSTANTLY AND INTO THIS PUT A PINCH OF SAFFRON THAT HAS BEEN BRUISED
CREOLE GUMBO SOUP TAKE TWO YOUNG CHICKENS CUT IN PIECES ROLL IN FLOUR AND FRY TO LIGHT BROWN
HERE ARE STILL WINES AND THOSE THAT SPARKLE
IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER GENTLEMAN ENTERED AND OUR COMPANIONS AT ONCE BEGAN FRANTIC GESTICULATIONS AND CALLED HIM TO OUR TABLE WHERE ROOM WAS MADE AND ANOTHER COVER LAID
AS YOU LOOK AROUND YOU NOTE ANOTHER THING
TAKE THE SEEDS OF THE PEPPERS ONE SMALL WHITE ONION AND TWO TOMATOES AND GRIND ALL TOGETHER INTO A PULP ADD A LITTLE SALT AND LET COOK TEN MINUTES
PUT THE COCOANUT INTO A PAN WITH WATER IN IT AND SET IN THE OVEN WELL HEATED FOR ONE HOUR BASTING FREQUENTLY TO PREVENT THE COCOANUT'S BURNING
WE DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THE RESTAURANT WAS BUT HAD HEARD OF SUCH A PLACE AND WHEN WE RECEIVED WORD THAT WE WOULD BE PERMITTED TO HAVE A DINNER THERE WE INVITED A NEWSPAPER FRIEND WHO WAS IN THE CITY FROM NEW YORK TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHER FRIENDS AND THE JAPANESE WHO WAS THE EDITOR OF THE SOKO SHIMBUN
IT IS ALSO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE WAY OF GETTING A GOOD DINNER
WITH THE PASSING OF THE QUEUE CAME THE ADOPTION OF THE AMERICAN STYLE OF DRESSING AND MUCH OF THE PICTURESQUENESS OF THE OLD CHINATOWN HAS DISAPPEARED
HERE ARE THE CORSICANS WITH THEIR PECULIAR IDEAS OF THE VENDETTA AND THE CHEAPNESS OF LIFE IN GENERAL AND THE SICILIANS AND GENOESE AND MILANESE
THAT OUR OPINION DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH THAT OF OTHERS DOES NOT CONCERN US IN THE LEAST FOR WE ARE PLEASED ONLY WITH THAT WHICH PLEASES US AND NOT THAT WITH WHICH OTHERS SAY WE OUGHT TO BE PLEASED
REMEMBER THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE LATIN QUARTER THESE THINGS ARE ALL USUAL CONSEQUENTLY THEY THINK YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS THEY DO AND WILL VOLUNTEER NO INFORMATION REGARDING THEM
IN WASHINGTON STREET JUST OFF COLUMBUS AVENUE IS BONINI'S BARN MAKING GREAT PRETENSE THROUGH AN UNIQUE IDEA
FRY IT SAY MY PARTNER
TAKE ONE-HALF CUP OF RICE AND BOIL IT UNTIL NEARLY DONE THEN DRAIN IT WELL AND ADD IT TO THE FRYING ONIONS AND PEPPERS
SOME SAY IT IS AN EXTORTION AND REFUSE TO PAY IT
WHEN CLAUS SPRECKELS BUILT THE TALL SPRECKELS BUILDING PIERRE AND HIS PARTNER OPENED THE CALL RESTAURANT IN THE TOP STORIES
CLOS DE VOGEOT
IN ORDER THAT THOSE WHO COME WITHIN OUR GATES AND MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE RESIDED HERE IN BLINDNESS FOR YEARS MAY KNOW WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO EAT AND THAT THEY MAY CARRY AWAY WITH THEM A KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO PREPARE SOME OF THE DISHES PLEASING TO THE TASTE AND NOURISHING TO THE BODY THAT HAVE SPREAD SAN FRANCISCO'S FAME OVER THE WORLD WE HAVE DECIDED TO SET DOWN THE RESULT OF OUR EXPERIENCE AND STUDY OF OUR BOHEMIAN POPULATION AND THEIR WAYS AND ALSO TELL WHERE TO FIND AND HOW TO ORDER THE BEST SPECIAL DISHES
LET US LIVE AS OLD TIME PASSES
MIX ALL WELL TOGETHER AND WITH THIS FILL THE HALF PEACHES
HERE ARE ITALIANS OF ALL AGES SEXES AND CONDITIONS OF SERVITUDE FROM THE PADRONE TO THE BOOTBLACK WHO WORKS FOR A PITTANCE UNTIL HE OBTAINS ENOUGH TO START HIMSELF IN BUSINESS
THREADING THEIR WAY IN AND OUT BETWEEN THE WHEELS AND THE HEELS OF HORSES WERE MEN AND WOMEN ALL LOOKING FOR BARGAINS IN FOOD
1892 1899 AND 1904
1893
AND WHILE YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE MUSIC YOU CAN ENJOY SUCH FOOD AS IS TO BE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR IT IS DISTINCTLY HEIDELBERGIAN
THE TORTILLA ON THE OTHER HAND IS MADE NOW EXACTLY AS IT WAS MADE BY THE MEXICAN INDIAN WHEN THE SPANISH FOUND THE COUNTRY
BUT THESE ARE THE SIGNS YOU WILL SEE AND WHEN YOU GO INSIDE YOU WILL HEAR NOTHING BUT THE GENTLE SPANISH OF THE MEXICAN SO TONED DOWN AND SO CHANGED THAT SOME OF THE CASTILIANS PROFESS TO BE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT
YOU SEE THE QUEER SHAPES OF BREAD AND NOTE THE NUMEROUS KINDS OF CAKES AND PASTRY THAT YOU NEVER SAW OR HEARD OF BEFORE
PIERRE SPECIALIZED IN FISH COOKED WITH WINE AND AS A FAVOR TO HIS PATRONS HE WOULD GO TO THE KITCHEN AND PREPARE THE DISH WITH HIS OWN HANDS
OF ALL VARIETIES TWO RANK FIRST IN THE ESTIMATION OF GOURMETS BUT OF COURSE THAT IS PURELY A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
THE BEST VARIETIES ARE
HERE THE STREETS ARE ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AT NIGHT AND THRONGED WITH PEOPLE FOR HERE IS THE RESTAURANT AND THEATRE DISTRICT PROPER OF THE CITY
AS IT IS IN MEATS SO IT IS IN ALL FOODS
WASTE CONSEQUENT UPON LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD VALUES IS THE WASTE THAT IS DOUBLY EXPENSIVE FOR IT NOT ONLY WASTES FOOD BUT IT ALSO WASTES THE SYSTEM WHOSE ENERGY IS EXHAUSTED IN TRYING TO ASSIMILATE IMPROPER ALIMENTATION
FLOWING NECKTIES SUCH AS ARE AFFECTED BY PARISIAN ART STUDENTS WERE WORN BY THE MEN
WHILE THERE IS A DISTINCTIVE GERMAN ATMOSPHERE AT THE RATHSKELLER OF THE GERMAN HOUSE THE PLACE IS TOO FAR OUT TO GATHER SUCH NUMBERS AS CONGREGATE AT EITHER THE HEIDELBERG OR THE HOF BRAU BUT ONE CAN GET THE BEST OF GERMAN COOKING HERE AND SPLENDID SERVICE AND FOR A QUIET LITTLE DUTCH SUPPER WE KNOW OF NO PLACE THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE YOU BETTER THAN THE RATHSKELLER
WE FIND THAT ITALIAN POLENTI SPANISH TAMALE PHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE AND SOUTHERN DARKEY CRACKLING CORN BREAD ARE BUT VARIANTS OF THE PREPARATION OF CORN MEAL IN DELECTABLE FOODS
OTHER BURGUNDIES ARE
FILLET OF ENGLISH SOLE SAUCE TARTARE
PUT THIS IN A STEWPAN AND SET IT OVER A SLOW FIRE TO SIMMER FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THEN RUB IT THROUGH A SIEVE WITH CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE INTO A BASIN CONTAINING ICE WATER
SO EARLY THAT ONE OF US STRENUOUSLY PRETENDED SLEEP WHILE THE OTHER GAVE URGENT REMINDER THAT THIS WAS THE DAY WE WERE TO GO TO FISHERMEN'S WHARF
A LARGE AND ORNATE BAR EXTENDED ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE IMMENSE ROOM AND TABLES WERE PLACED ABOUT THE ROOM AND IN A BALCONY THAT RAN ALONG ONE SIDE
ICE CREAM OR RUM OMELET
LAZZARINI HE WITH THE BIG VOICE PRESIDES OVER THE TINY KITCHEN IN THE REAR OF THE ROOM DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND FAMILY AFFAIRS
MONTEREY BAY IS ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S SOURCES OF SUPPLY CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE A GREATER VARIETY OF FISH IN OUR MARKETS THAN ARE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE
SEASON WITH SALT AND SERVE
BEAT ALL TOGETHER AND POUR AROUND THE MUSHROOMS
DO YOU WISH TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT CONDITIONS IN MEXICO
CLARENCE E
CHAMBERTIN
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT ALL THAT WAS SET BEFORE US BUT JAPANESE CUSTOM FORBIDS SUCH A BREACH OF ETIQUETTE AS AN INDICATION THAT THE FOOD WAS NOT PERFECTION CONSEQUENTLY THE SERVING MAIDS APPEARED BEARING SIX CARVED TEAK BOXES AND PLACED ONE AT EACH PLATE
BOHEMIANISM IS THE PROTEST OF NATURALISM AGAINST THE TOO RIGID AND OFT-TIMES ABSURD RESTRICTIONS ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY
PORT
ADD TO THE PAN ONE-HALF GLASSFUL OF WHITE WINE AND PUT IN THE OVEN FOR TWENTY MINUTES
IN HIS POMPEIIAN GARDEN COPPA STILL MAINTAINS HIS OLD REPUTATION FOR MOST TASTY VIANDS AND LIBERAL PORTIONS AND IF ONE DESIRE TO FIND THE TRUE BOHEMIAN RESTAURANT OF SAN FRANCISCO TODAY ONE THAT APPROACHES THE OLD SPIRIT OF THE DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE HE NEED BUT GO OUT TO COPPA'S AND WHILE HE WILL NOT HAVE HIS EYES REGALED BY THE QUAINT DRAWINGS WITH WHICH THE OLD-TIME ARTISTS DECORATED THE WALLS NOR THE HURRYING FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE CEILING TO THE FAMOUS CENTER TABLE WHERE SAT SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST NOTABLE BOHEMIANS ON THEIR VISITS TO SAN FRANCISCO NOR THE FRIEZE OF BLACK CATS AROUND THE CORNICE NOR THE BOHEMIAN VERSE WRITTEN UNDER INSPIRATION OF DAGO RED HE WILL FIND THE SAME OLD COOKING DONE BY COPPA HIMSELF
IT IS EASY TO PASS FROM A RARE FLAVOR THAT MAKES A MOST SAVORY DISH TO A TASTE OF MEDICINE THAT SPOILS A DINNER
TURN ANOTHER CORNER AFTER LEAVING FIORINI'S AND LOOK DOWN INTO A BASEMENT
DRESS WITH SPRIGS OF MINT AND SPRINKLE WITH POWDERED SUGAR
SPRINKLE WITH CHOPPED PARSLEY AND LET COOK FIVE MINUTES
CHICKEN PORTOLA A LA COPPA TAKE A FRESH COCOANUT AND CUT OFF THE TOP REMOVING NEARLY ALL OF THE MEAT
OYSTER SALAD TO A SOLID PINT OF OYSTERS USE A DRESSING MADE AS FOLLOWS
AT THE GIANDUJA AT UNION AND STOCKTON STREETS ONE IS CERTAIN TO GET FISH COOKED WELL AND THAT IT IS PERFECTLY FRESH
SAN FRANCISCO'S LATIN QUARTER IS APPEALING ENTICING AND HYPNOTIZING
MASH TWO CLOVES OF GARLIC AND MIX WITH A LITTLE MINCED PARSLEY
OF COURSE YOUR WINES AND COCKTAILS WILL BE EXTRA AND THESE MUST BE RECKONED IN THE COST
PROBABLY AT NO PLACE IN SAN FRANCISCO CAN ONE FIND GAME COOKED BETTER THAN AT JACK'S 615 SACRAMENTO STREET
AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS OCCURRED UNTIL FINALLY AT A TABLE SUITED FOR FOUR NINE OF US WERE EATING LAUGHING AND TALKING TOGETHER WE BEING TAKEN INTO THE COMRADESHIP WITHOUT QUESTION
ST JULIEN
IN EUROPE THIS STAGE WAS REACHED MANY GENERATIONS AGO AND THERE IT IS NOW AN ART WHICH HAS ELEVATED THE PRIMITIVE PROCESS OF FEEDING TO THE ELEGANT ART OF DINING
REMOVE QUICKLY AND DIP AGAIN IN THE BATTER AND THEN AGAIN IN THE LARD WHERE IT IS TO REMAIN UNTIL FRIED A LIGHT GOLDEN BROWN KEEPING THE PEPPERS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH THE BOILING LARD
IT WAS OPEN--YES
IF YOU WISHED TO STAY THERE IN COMFORT YOU HAD TO BE ONE OF THEM AND DIGNITY HAD TO BE LEFT OUTSIDE OR IT WOULD MAKE YOU SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT YOU WOULD CARRY IT OUT TO AN ACCOMPANIMENT OF LAUGHTER AND JEERS OF THE REST OF THE DINERS
LUNA'S DINNERS WERE A FEATURE OF THE OLD SAN FRANCISCO
OVER IN THE LITTLE ITALIAN AND FRENCH SHOPS YOU WILL FIND SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL SAUSAGES THAT MIND CAN CONCEIVE OF
RALSTON
FOLLOWING THIS CAME THE SECOND SERVICE OF TEA THIS TIME IN CUPS OF A RARE YELLOW COLOR AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGN WITH SIMILAR TEAPOT
SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRE BLANCO FORMERLY CONNECTED WITH THE OLD POODLE DOG OPENED A PLACE IN O'FARRELL STREET BETWEEN HYDE AND LARKIN CALLING IT BLANCO'S DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST RESTAURANT IN THE CITY AND IT IS STILL ONE OF THE NOTED PLACES
SLICE TWO ONIONS INTO FOUR TABLESPOONFULS OF OLIVE OIL TOGETHER WITH A TABLESPOONFUL OF DICED BACON FRIED IN OLIVE OIL ADD ONE CHOPPED GREEN PEPPER HALF A DOZEN TOMATOES STEWED WITH SALT AND PEPPER ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC AND COOK ALL TOGETHER UNTIL IT THICKENS
HERE IS SERVED SUCH A VARIETY OF STRANGE DISHES THAT ONE HAS TO BE A BRAVE BOHEMIAN INDEED TO PARTAKE WITHOUT QUESTION
THIS PLACE IS NOW RUNNING AS THE PORTOLA-LOUVRE
CHAMPAGNES
MONEY POSITION PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND EVEN BRAINS ARE OF NO AVAIL IF THERE BE THE BAR SINISTER--UNFIT
PACK IN ICE AND SALT TWO HOURS AND SERVE WITH CARAMEL SAUCE
ORDINARILY ONE CAN IMAGINE NOTHING MORE REPULSIVE THAN A DISH OF RAW FISH BUT WE WERE TEMPTED AND DID EAT AND FOUND IT MOST DELICIOUS DELICATE AND WITH A FLAVOR OF RAW OYSTERS
A TIP SHOULD ALWAYS DEPEND UPON THE SERVICE RENDERED
FRANCATELLI THE GREAT CHEF WHO WAS AT THE HEAD OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S KITCHEN BOASTS PROUDLY OF HIS DIPLOMA FROM THE PARISIAN COLLEGE OF COOKING
THE LAND OF BOHEMIA BOHEMIA
HERE YOU WILL FIND BETTER AND FRESHER FOOD SUPPLIES THAN IN ANY OF THE SIMILAR PLACES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY AND THE PRICE IS GENERALLY ONE-THIRD LESS
PUT THE EGGS INTO AN OMELET PAN OVER A SLOW FIRE
WE SUPPOSE IT IS ALL IN THE POINT OF VIEW AND OUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING EXCEPT SUPERFICIALITY IN THE ORDINARY CHINESE RESTAURANTS FREQUENTED BY AMERICANS AND THOSE NOT SO FREQUENTED ARE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE AVERAGE CHINAMAN'S DISREGARD FOR DIRT AND THE USUAL NICETIES OF FOOD PREPARATION
GO INSIDE AND YOU WILL FIND THAT FIORINI CAN TALK JUST ENOUGH ENGLISH TO MAKE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD WHILE HIS GOOD WIFE HIS SOLE ASSISTANT CAN NEITHER SPEAK NOR UNDERSTAND ANY BUT HER NATIVE ITALIAN
OLD PERSONALITIES HAVE PASSED AWAY AND OLD CUSTOMS HAVE DEGENERATED
HAVE THE YOLKS OF EGGS WELL BEATEN AND ADD TO THEM THE CREAM AND LOBSTER FAT STIR WELL AND THEN STIR IN A TEASPOONFUL OF FLOUR
WHEN SOLARI OPENED HIS RESTAURANT AT 354 GEARY STREET WHERE HE CONTINUES TO ATTRACT GOOD LIVERS BY THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS COOKING HE AT ONCE ACHIEVED FAME WHICH HAS NEVER WANED

CHEESES FROM ITALY THAT ARE MADE FROM GOATS MILK ASSES MILK COWS MILK AND MARES MILK AND ALSO CHEESES FROM SPAIN MEXICO GERMANY SWITZERLAND AND ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE CHEESE EVEN INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES
YOU CAN BE A BOHEMIAN AND HAVE THE VERY BEST SORT OF LIVING IN YOUR OWN ROOM FOR LESS THAN HALF THE MONEY IT WILL TAKE TO LIVE AT THE HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS AND WE ARE SURE MANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HOW TO DO IT
THE FRONTISPIECE OF THIS BOOK IS FROM ONE OF THE FEW EXISTING IF NOT THE ONLY ONE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PLACE
THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT ERAS TO THE HISTORY OF THE PALACE HOTEL THE FIRST BEING FROM 1876 TO 1890 THE SECOND FROM 1890 TO 1906 AND THE THIRD FROM 1906 TO THE PRESENT DAY
CHICKEN COUNTRY STYLE CUT A CHICKEN IN EIGHT PIECES AND DROP THEM INTO SOME COLD MILK SEASONING WITH SALT
ITALIAN WINES ARE MOSTLY RED THE MOST NOTED IN CALIFORNIA BEING CHIANTI AND ITS CALIFORNIA PROTOTYPE

OLIVES
GARNISH THE TOPS WITH HARD BOILED EGGS SLICED AND CAPERS AND RIPE OLIVES FROM WHICH THE STONES HAVE BEEN REMOVED
RHEIN AND MOSELLE
OUR TABLE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO SEAT FOUR COMFORTABLY AND PRESENTLY AS THE ROOM BECAME CROWDED THE PROPRIETOR WITH MANY EXCUSES ASKED IF HE COULD SEAT TWO GENTLEMEN WITH US
IF YOU WERE EVER IN PALERMO AND WENT INTO THE LITTLE SIDE STREETS YOU SAW THE STRINGS OF MACARONI SPAGHETTI AND OTHER PASTES DRYING IN THE SUN WHILE CHILDREN AND DOGS PLAYED THROUGH AND AROUND IT GIVING YOU SUCH A DISTASTE FOR IT THAT YOU HAVE NOT EATEN ANY ITALIAN PASTE SINCE
YOU NOW TAKE COGNIZANCE OF MANY THINGS THAT HERETOFORE ESCAPED YOUR OBSERVATION
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT IN THE HIGHER CLASS OF RESTAURANTS BUT THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES WHEN YOU MUST REMEMBER YOU ARE MAKING A STUDY OF HUMAN INTEREST AND NOT GETTING A MEAL AND YOU MUST LEAVE YOUR FASTIDIOUSNESS AND SQUEAMISHNESS AT HOME
TO CAP THE CLIMAX THE JAPANESE STRIPPED THE ROOM OF ITS BOUNTEOUS DECORATION OF CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND PILED THEM INTO OUR ARMS AND WE WENT HOME LOADED WITH FOOD AND FLOWERS
AT THE CORNER OF MARKET AND EDDY STREETS IS THE ODEON DOWN IN A BASEMENT WITH DECORATIONS OF MOST GARISH ORDER
1892
IT IS THEIR DREAM AND WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH IT OR THEM
OEUFFS AU SOLIEL POACH EIGHT FRESH EGGS THEN TAKE THEM OUT AND PLACE IN COLD WATER UNTIL COOL
IN ANOTHER FRYING PAN AT THE SAME TIME FRY THREE GOOD-SIZED ONIONS AND THREE GREEN PEPPERS
SIMMER IN THE COVERED KETTLE FOR ONE HOUR AND SET ASIDE TO COOL
AMID BRIGHT LIGHTS STREETS CENTERING AROUND POWELL FROM MARKET UP TO GEARY MAY WELL BE TERMED THE GREAT WHITE WAY OF SAN FRANCISCO IF NEW YORK WILL PERMIT THE PLAGIARISM
TO NONE OF THESE FOR FROM THEM CAME NOT THE INSPIRATION
THIS WAS ON THE CORNER OF FILLMORE AND ELLIS AND HAD LARGE PATRONAGE IT BEING CROWDED NIGHTLY WITH MEN AND WOMEN WHO SEEMED TO FORGET THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAD BEEN DESTROYED
BEAUTIFUL FRESH SAND-DABS BUT AN HOUR OR TWO OUT OF THE WATER WERE FIVE CENTS A POUND WHILE SEA BASS FRESH COD MACKEREL AND SIMILAR FISH WENT AT THE SAME PRICE
WHAT I WANT IS SOMETHING UNUSUAL IT HAS BEEN TOLD US THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR GOT BACK HOME HE TRIED TO TELL SOME OF HIS FRIENDS ABOUT THAT DINNER BUT THEY TOLD HIM HE HAD ACQUIRED THE CALIFORNIA HABIT OF TALKING WIDE
THERE WERE ROOMS DECORATED TO REPRESENT VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND IN EACH ROOM YOU COULD GET A DINNER OF THE COUNTRY REPRESENTED
WHEN YOU VISIT SAN FRANCISCO YOU ARE DESIROUS OF SO ARRANGING YOUR FINANCES THAT YOU MAY SEE THE MOST FOR THE LEAST OUTLAY OF MONEY
FOR INSTANCE YOU WILL BE SERVED WITH AN EXCELLENT PASTE AT A FRENCH RESTAURANT BUT IF YOU WANT IT AT ITS BEST YOU WILL GET IT AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT
DEIDESHEIMER
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT YOU WILL THINK THE RESTAURANT HAS CHANGED HANDS BETWEEN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
ONE CAN ALMOST IMAGINE HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE FAMOUS RATHSKELLERS OF OLD HEIDELBERG--NOT AT THE SCHLOSS OF COURSE FOR HERE YOU CANNOT LOOK DOWN ON THE WEISER AS IT FLOWS BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT WINE STUBE ON THE HILL
OUR FIRST CUP WAS TAKEN STANDING IN DEFERENCE TO A JAPANESE CUSTOM WHERE ALL DRANK TO THE HOST
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GO THERE AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES
ACCOMPANYING THIS WAS A GLASS OF KRUG AND THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A GLASS OF ZABAIONE FOR DESSERT
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PORTOLA-LOUVRE AT 15 POWELL STREET IS THE MODERNIZED TECHAU TAVERN NOW KNOWN AS TECHAU'S HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER-THEATRE HOURS
THESE MENUS WILL GIVE A GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF DINNERS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED
SO FAR AS THE RESTAURANT IS CONCERNED THE FOOD IS A LITTLE BELOW THE AVERAGE OF ITALIAN RESTAURANTS
LET IT COOK AWHILE THEN ADD A FINELY CHOPPED CLOVE OF GARLIC AND A LITTLE SAGE
THEIR LACK OF CONVENTIONALITY DOES NOT TEND TO BOORISHNESS
PUT ALL IN A DOUBLE BOILER AND COOK UNTIL IT ALL IS AS THICK AS SOFT CUSTARD ABOUT SIX MINUTES STIRRING CONSTANTLY
THE CUISINE IS OF THE BEST AND THE CHEFS RANK AT THE TOP OF THEIR ART
HERE ARE GERMAN FAMILIES FROM GROSSFADER AND GROSSMUTTER DOWN TO THE NEWEST GRANDCHILD SITTING AND ENJOYING THEIR BEER AND LISTENING TO SUCH MUSIC AS CAN BE HEARD NOWHERE ELSE IN SAN FRANCISCO AS THEY EAT THEIR SANDWICHES OF LIMBURGER OR MORE DAINTY DISHES ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTES
PLACE ALL IN A STEWPAN AND ADD A SMALL LADLEFUL OF DRAWN BUTTER SAUCE AND THE JUICE OF A LEMON
IT WAS SERVED COLD WITH A PECULIAR SAUCE
FROWN AND YOU GET BLACK LOOKS
CHOP AN ONION A CLOVE OF GARLIC AND SOME PARSLEY FINE AND PUT IN THE PAN TOGETHER WITH A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER
THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS
VERY GOOD TOO
BOTH SERVE GOOD SPANISH DINNERS AT REASONABLE PRICES
TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT THE SHELVES FILLED WITH BOTTLES OF WINE
AS BEFORE MENTIONED IF YOU WISH A TABLE D'HOTE DINNER COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF SEA FOOD YOU CAN GET IT AT THE SHELL FISH GROTTO FOR ONE DOLLAR
TOM COD ROCK COD FRESH MACKEREL AND FRESH COD WHITE BAIT AND BONED SMELT ALL ARE EXCELLENT FISH BUT WERE WE TO ATTEMPT TO TELL OF ALL THE FISH TO BE FOUND HERE WE WOULD HAVE TO REPRODUCE A PISCATORIAL DIRECTORY
A TUB OF WATER WAS BROUGHT IN AND IN THIS WAS SWIMMING A LIVE FISH APPARENTLY OF THE CARP FAMILY
STRANGE DRIED VEGETABLES AND DELICACIES UNHEARD OF
OTHERS HAVE BEEN IMPROMPTU NEITHER THE HOUR THE PLACE NOR THE DRESS BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
I HEAR THE GROWL AND YOWL AND HOWL OF EACH NOCTURNAL FIGHT AND THE THROATY STIR HALF CRY HALF PURR OF PASSIONATE DELIGHT AS SEEKING AN AMOROUS RENDEZVOUS MY ANCIENT BROTHERS GO STEALING THROUGH THE PURPLE GLOOM OF NIGHT
WE PRONOUNCE IT GOOD
THIS IS ONE OF THE GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANTS OF THE LATIN QUARTER
THE OLD COPPA RESTAURANT IN MONTGOMERY STREET BECAME A MEMORY AND ON ITS ASHES CAME THE NEW ONE LOCATED IN PINE STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY STREETS AND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THIS REMAINED THE IDOL OF BOHEMIA UNTIL CHANGED CONDITIONS DROVE THE TIDE OF PATRONAGE FAR UP TOWARD POWELL ELLIS EDDY AND O'FARRELL STREETS
CHICKEN PORTOLA
WITH REVERENCE WE THINK OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE EARLY SAN FRANCISCO
BUT THERE IS OTHER MUSIC--SOMETIMES NEITHER INSPIRING NOR BEAUTIFUL WHEN HEARD IN A GERMAN RATHSKELLER--THE MUSIC OF RAG TIME
IF THIS SOUND EGOTISTICAL WE ARE SORRY FOR IT IS NOT MEANT IN THAT WAY
HERE SOME OF OUR MOST PLEASANT EVENINGS HAVE BEEN SPENT AND WE NEVER FEAR TO GO ON ACCOUNT OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY BE EMBARRASSED OR INCONVENIENCED THROUGH LACK OF SOMETHING TO EAT OR DRINK FOR HE IS NEVER AT A LOSS TO PREPARE SOMETHING DAINTY AND APPETIZING FOR US AND IT REALLY SEEMS SOMETIMES THAT HE MAKES A MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
ALL THE TIME HE SAY FRY IT ONE DAY A LADY SHE COME INTO DA STORE AN SHE SEE DA BIG BUCKET OF RIPE OLIVES
THIS DINNER MUST BE ORDERED THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE
IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT DISH TO PREPARE AND IF YOU CANNOT GET IT AT ANY OF THE RESTAURANTS AND WE ARE SURE YOU CANNOT TRY IT AT HOME SOME TIME AND SURPRISE YOUR FRIENDS WITH A DISH TO BE FOUND IN ONLY ONE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD
TO OBVIATE THIS HE ORDERED HIS CHEF TO PREPARE EACH DAY A LIST OF WHAT WAS TO BE SERVED AND TO SHOW THEIR ROTATION DURING THE MEAL AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER THE FIRST MENU CARD WAS WRITTEN
TOO MANY AMERICANS WHEN THEY TRAVEL DESIRE TO APPEAR IMPORTANT AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS IS BY BUYING THE SUBSERVIENCY OF MENIALS WHO LAUGH AT THEM BEHIND THEIR BACKS
AND BY THE WAY MANY OF THE GOOD DISHES OF BOHEMIA ARE THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT RATHER THAN DESIGN
BUT NEITHER IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE FINE DISHES SERVED TO CHINESE EPICURES
THAT YOU CAN CHANGE EXISTENCE INTO LIVING
SULTANA ROLL ADD THE BEATEN YOLKS OF SEVEN EGGS TO ONE PINT OF BOILING MILK ONE CUP OF SUGAR ONE-HALF TEASPOONFUL OF VANILLA ONE-QUARTER TEASPOONFUL OF ALMOND EXTRACT
PUT IN A SMALL GLASS OF MARSALA WINE TOMATO SAUCE AND FRENCH MUSHROOMS AND LET SIMMER FOR TEN MINUTES
OF ALL THE WAYS OF COOKING CLAMS CHOWDER TAKES PRECEDENCE AS A RULE AND IT IS GOOD WHEN MADE PROPERLY
SERVE ON A NAPKIN AND GARNISH WITH PARSLEY AND POTATOES DUCHESSE
WHEN WE COOK CHINA STYLE EVERYTHING IS MORE BETTER
BE THAT AS IT MAY THEY ALL ARE GOOD WITH MANY OTHERS FOLLOWING CLOSE IN CHOICE
IT HAS BEEN SO MISUSED AS TO BRING THE VERY WORD INTO DISREPUTE
OYSTER OMELET FOR TWO
WHEN HE WAS HERE IN THE YEARS LONG GONE BY IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO GO TO THE OLD CALIFORNIA MARKET SELECT WHAT HE DESIRED TO EAT THEN TAKE IT TO THE RESTAURANT AND HAVE IT COOKED AND THE OLD ATMOSPHERE CAME BACK TO HIM ON HIS RECENT ARRIVAL AND HE REVIVED THE OLD CUSTOM
THAT WONDERFUL CITY WHERE YOU GET THE BEST THERE IS TO EAT SERVED IN A MANNER THAT ENHANCES ITS FLAVOR AND ESTABLISHES IT FOREVER IN YOUR MEMORY WERE ONE TO WRITE OF SAN FRANCISCO AND OMIT MENTION OF ITS GUSTATORY DELIGHTS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD PROTEST FOR IN SAN FRANCISCO EATING IS AN ART AND COOKING A SCIENCE AND HE WHO KNOWS NOT WHAT SAN FRANCISCO PROVIDES KNOWS NEITHER ART NOR SCIENCE
ADD ONE TABLESPOONFUL OF FLOUR TO THE WINE AND COOK TO A CREAM THEN POUR OVER THE EGGS
THE WHOLE WAS DELICATELY FLAVORED WITH A PECULIAR SAUCE
COOK A FEW MINUTES
AROUND LITTLE ITALY SAN FRANCISCO HOLDS NO MORE INTERESTING DISTRICT THAN THAT LYING AROUND THE BASE OF TELEGRAPH HILL AND EXTENDING OVER TOWARD NORTH BEACH EVEN AS FAR AS FISHERMAN'S WHARF
CHATEAU LA ROSE
FEW THERE ARE WHO HAVE THE HEART TO MAKE MERRY AMID CRUMBLING RUINS OF ALL THEY HELD DEAR IN THE MATERIAL WORLD
AT THE GIANDUJA YOU WILL FIND SAND-DABS AU GRATIN TO BE VERY FINE
THEIR FEASTS WERE EVENTS OF CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND LONG PREPARATION AND THOSE WHOSE MEMORIES CARRY THEM BACK TO THE EARLY DAYS RECALL BOUNTEOUS LOADING OF TABLES WHEN FESTAL OCCASION CALLED FOR DISPLAY
TO WHOM THEN
THOMPSON ENLISTED OTHERS TO JOIN WITH HIM IN OPENING A MAGNIFICENT PLACE UNDER THE NEW FLOOD BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF POWELL AND MARKET STREET BUT THROUGH FAULTY UNDERSTANDING OF FINANCIAL POWER THOMPSON WAS COMPELLED TO GIVE UP HIS INTEREST AND THE PLACE AFTERWARD CLOSED
SOME SERVE BOTH WHITE AND YELLOW AND OTHERS SERVE BUT THE CHINESE AND A FEW FAVORED WHITE FRIENDS
IT IS NOT NEARLY SO INTERESTING TO LOOK AT BUT IT GIVES A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT COMES OUT OF THE SEA EVERY DAY TO SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
SERVE ON HOT PLATES
RICH WITH DELICATE FLAVOR AND EXCELLENT BOUQUET
THE TWO YOUNG LADIES AND THE YOUNG MAN PREPARED THE TABLE AND THE OTHER LADY AND THE TWO GENTLEMEN SET ABOUT GETTING A MEAL
AT THE TWO MENTIONED ONE PAYS FOR THE SURROUNDINGS AS WELL AS FOR THE FOOD AND SOMETIMES THIS IS WORTH PAYING FOR
HEREIN LIES THE SECRET OF A GOOD TABLE-PROPER COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS AND PROPER VARIATION AND SELECTION OF THE PROVISIONS TOGETHER WITH PROPER PREPARATION AND COOKING OF THE FOOD
ICE CREAM OR FRIED CREAM
CLARETS ARE VALUED FOR THEIR FLAVOR AND FOR THEIR TONIC PROPERTIES
IN THE GRAVY PUT A TUMBLERFUL OF CREAM AND A PINCH OF PAPRIKA MIX WELL AND LET IT COOK FOR TEN MINUTES UNTIL IT GETS THICK THEN STRAIN AND POUR OVER THE CHICKEN AND SERVE
IF THE KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD VALUES WERE WITH YOU YOU WOULD GET THE LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE NOURISHING CUTS
ON A LARGE HUSK PUT SEVERAL TABLESPOONFULS OF CHOPPED MEAT WITH OLIVES
SOME FAR MORE INTERESTING GATHERINGS HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOMS OF BOHEMIAN FRIENDS
SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA SEPTEMBER 22 1914
LET THESE BOIL VERY QUICK FOR TWELVE MINUTES KEEPING THE PAN TIGHTLY COVERED
IN ADDITION TO ABALONE'S THE HOF BRAU MAKES A SPECIALTY OF LITTLE OREGON CRAWFISH
PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY-FIVE OF THE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
THE FOLLOWING WINES MAY BE CONSIDERED THE BEST TYPES
SOME OF THE BEST ARE
AS YOU WONDER YOU PEEP TIMIDLY IN THE DOOR AND THEN WALK IN FROM SHEER AMAZEMENT
OF COURSE ALL THIS REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT IS EASILY ACQUIRED AND IT ADDS TO THE ZEST OF LIFE TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WHICH LIFTS EATING FROM THE PLANE OF FEEDING TO THAT OF DINING
AS THE MALE HUMAN WAS LARGELY DOMINANT IN NUMBERS IT WAS BUT NATURAL THAT THEY SHOULD GATHER TOGETHER FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND HERE BEGAN THE BOHEMIAN SPIRIT THAT HAS MARKED THE CITY FOR ITS OWN TO THE PRESENT DAY
AMERICAN PRODIGALITY AND ASININITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE ABUSE OF TIPPING
IN THE MARKETS ARE FISH FROM ALL PARTS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN FROM THE TROPICS TO FAR NORTH IN THE ARCTICS WHILE DENIZENS OF THE WATERS ALL THE WAY BETWEEN ADD TO THE VARIETY
THIS WAS DISTINCTLY GERMAN IN APPOINTMENTS AND COOKING AND WAS THE BEST OF ITS KIND IN THE CITY
DURING THE DAY ITS TERRACES ARE FILLED WITH VISITORS FROM ABROAD WHO MAKE THIS A PART OF THEIR ITINERARY AND HERE AS THEY DRINK IN THE WONDROUS BEAUTY OF THE SCENE SPREAD BEFORE THEM PARTAKE OF WELL PREPARED AND WELL SERVED DISHES SUCH AS MADE BOTH THE CLIFF HOUSE AND SAN FRANCISCO WELL AND FAVORABLY KNOWN AND WHOSE FAME IS NOT BOUNDED BY THE CONTINENT
BACK AGAIN TO THE HEART OF THE CITY AND WE STOPPED AT RAGGI'S IN MONTGOMERY STREET NEAR COMMERCIAL WHERE WE HAD A GLASS OF BRANDY IN WHICH WAS A CHINOTTI A PECULIAR ITALIAN PRESERVED FRUIT WHICH IS SAID TO BE A CROSS BETWEEN A CITRON AND AN ORANGE THEN AROUND THE CORNER TO GOUAILHARDOU RONDEL'S THE MARKET CAFE WHERE FROM A PLAIN PINE TABLE AND ON SANDED FLOOR WE HAD OUR COFFEE ROYAL
YET WHEN ALL IS CONSIDERED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAIN AMERICAN COOKING AND WHAT IS TERMED FOREIGN COOKING IS BUT THE PROPER USE OF CONDIMENTS AND SEASONING COMBINED WITH PROPER VARIETY OF THE FOOD SUPPLY FROM THE MARKETS
IN THE CENTER OF THE DOUGH PUT A TEASPOONFUL OF THE CHOPPED MEAT WITH MINCED OLIVE
IT HAS BEEN THE CLOAK OF DEBAUCHERY AND THE EXCUSE FOR SEX DEGRADATION
NEXT CAME THE THIRD SERVICE OF TEA THIS TIME IN A DEEP RED WARE
THE SECOND RECIPE WAS FOR FRITTO MISTO AND HE WROTE IT AS FOLLOWS
HAVING ALWAYS HEARD THAT ORIENTALS TURNED MENUS TOPSY-TURVY WE WERE NOT AT ALL SURPRISED WHEN THE LITTLE SERVING WOMEN BROUGHT TO EACH OF US TWO SILVER PLATES AND SET THEM ON OUR TRAYS
SPRINKLE THESE WITH A LITTLE LIME JUICE AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN IN BUTTER ADDING SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE
THIS PLACE BECAME NOTED FOR ITS ROAST BEEF AND ALSO FOR ITS CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE WHICH WAS SAID TO BE OF MOST EXCELLENT FLAVOR
TO REMOVE THE SNAILS USE SMALL WOODEN TOOTHPICKS
THICKEN WITH BREAD AND ADD TWO OR THREE SMALL GREEN PEPPERS AND AN ONION SLICED FINE
AT THE GIANDUJA AS AT ALL OTHER ITALIAN RESTAURANTS NOT MUCH AFFECTED BY AMERICANS YOU WILL FIND AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCONVENTIONALITY THAT IS DELIGHTFUL TO THE BOHEMIAN
CONTINUE MAKING THESE LAYERS UNTIL ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE PLACED IN THE STEWPAN AND THEN POUR ON THE TOP SUFFICIENT WATER TO JUST SHOW
UNDER THE PHELAN BUILDING AT O'FARRELL AND MARKET WAS THE OLD LOUVRE IN WHICH PLACE ONE COULD GET GERMAN COOKING BUT IT WAS NOT A PLACE THAT APPEALED TO THOSE WHO KNEW GOOD SERVICE
IN THE PRE-FIRE DAYS THERE WERE MANY PLACES WHICH PAID ESPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE COOKING OF THE CRAB AMONG THEM BEING THE COBWEB PALACE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND GOBEY'S
MEMORIES ON THE MORROW
THERE IS BUT ONE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE CLAM CHOWDER AND THAT IS EITHER TO MAKE IT YOURSELF OR CLOSELY SUPERINTEND THE MAKING AND THIS IS THE WAY TO MAKE IT
POUR INTO A DOUBLE BOILER CONTAINING BOILING WATER IN LOWER PART OF UTENSIL
ONE CAN WELL IMAGINE BEING IN A CAVE OF FLESH YET IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT SAUSAGE IS BUT A PART OF THE STRANGE EDIBLE THINGS TO BE HAD HERE
MODESTY PREVENTS US GIVING IT MORE THAN THE NAME OF SCRAPPLE IT IS PREPARED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER DIFFERING FROM THAT MADE IN PHILADELPHIA
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS OF SERVING SHRIMPS AND THEY ARE ALSO MUCH USED TO GIVE FLAVOR TO CERTAIN FISH SAUCES
DRY ON A CLOTH AND DIP IN A BATTER OF FLOUR MIXED WITH EQUAL QUANTITIES OF ALE AND WATER TO THE CONSISTENCY OF DOUBLE CREAM
SOME OF THEM STILL CARRY THE NAMES AND MEMORIES OF THE OLD DAYS
PASTE MAKES WASTE IN AN ITALIAN GROCERY STORE WE NOTICED A GREAT VARIETY OF PASTES IN BOXES ARRANGED ALONG THE COUNTER AND BEGAN COUNTING THEM
IF WE WERE TO ATTEMPT EVEN TO ENUMERATE THE VARIOUS HERBS SPICES FLAVORINGS DELICACIES AND PASTES TO BE FOUND IN A WELL REGULATED ITALIAN SHOP IT WOULD TAKE MANY PAGES OF THIS BOOK YET EVERY ONE OF THESE ARTICLES HAS ITS OWN INDIVIDUAL AND PECULIAR USE AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ARTICLES AND HOW TO USE THEM IS WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMERICAN AND FOREIGN COOKING
MIX IN A SAUCEPAN OVER A FIRE WITHOUT BROWNING A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER A TABLESPOONFUL OF FLOUR THEN ADD HALF A PINT OF CREAM
CHANGE THE INTERIOR OF THE PLACE ENTIRELY BY HAVING AROUND THE WALLS A SERIES OF LARGE GLASS AQUARIA WITH AS MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH SWIMMING ABOUT AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET
POUND ALL THESE THOROUGHLY TOGETHER AND THEN PUT THEM INTO A STEWPAN WITH THE BROTH THAT HAS BEEN RESERVED IN A BASIN AND HAVING WARMED THE BISQUE THUS PREPARED RUB IT THROUGH A SIEVE INTO A FINE PUREE
LET IT COME TO A NEAR BOIL AND ADD HALF A GLASS OF DRY SHERRY AND SERVE
IT IS WHEN THE MARTIAL STRAINS OF DE WACHT AM RHEIN ARE HEARD FROM THE ORCHESTRA WHICH OF ITSELF IS AN INSTITUTION THAT THE TRUE CAMARADERIE OF THE PLACE IS APPRECIATED FOR THEN GUESTS WAITERS BARKEEPERS AND EVEN THE EAGLE-EYED GRAY-HAIRED MANAGER JOIN IN THE SWELLING CHORUS AND YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND WHY GERMAN SOLDIERS ARE INSPIRED TO MARCH TO VICTORY WHEN THEY HEAR THESE STIRRING CHORDS
TO US BOHEMIANISM MEANS THE NATURALISM OF REFINED PEOPLE
WE ASKED CHEF VICTOR HERTZLER WHAT HE CONSIDERED HIS BEST RECIPE AND HIS ANSWER WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
LET THEM COOK WELL AND THEN PUT IN SERVING DISH
IF YOU WERE ESPECIALLY PLEASED YOU GAVE THE DARKEYS TEN CENTS NOT BECAUSE YOU ENJOYED THE MUSIC BUT JUST BECAUSE THE ONE MERIT OF SANGUINETTI'S BEFORE THE FIRE WAS THE FACT THAT ALL THE REGULAR CUSTOMERS WERE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL
IF OUR KNOWLEDGE GOES A LITTLE FARTHER WE THINK ALSO OF TAGLIARINI WHICH IS THE ITALIAN EQUIVALENT OF NOODLES AS IT IS MADE WITH EGGS
THEY WERE STRICTLY MEXICAN FROM THE UNPALATABLE SOUP MEXICANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE GOOD SOUP TO THE DULCE SERVED AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEAL
IN FACT WE RATHER LIKE IT
PLACE THE CELERY IN A VESSEL AND STRAIN THE BROTH OVER IT
STIR FOR TWENTY MINUTES UNTIL A FOAM RISES THEN TAKE OUT AND WASH THOROUGHLY UNTIL THE WATER RUNS CLEAR
WE HAVE ENJOYED WONDERFUL BOHEMIAN DINNERS IN RESTAURANTS BUT THE OTHER DINERS WERE NOT AWARE OF IT
FIVE KINDS OF SALAD
AMONG THESE WERE THE BUON GUSTO THE FIOR D'ITALIA LA ESTRELLA CAMPI'S AND THE GIANDUJA
CUT IN SMALL PIECES ONE AND ONE-HALF POUNDS EACH OF COLD ROAST VEAL AND COLD BOILED TONGUE AND ADD TO THESE AND THE HERRINGS SIX BOILED POTATOES HALF A DOZEN SMALL CUCUMBER PICKLES AND TWO SMALL BOILED BEETS ALL CUT UP AND TWO RAW APPLES THREE BOILED CARROTS AND ONE LARGE BOILED CELERY ROOT ALL MINCED
BAKE SLOWLY FORTY-FIVE MINUTES
NEGRO'S AT 625 MERCHANT STREET NEAR THE HALL OF JUSTICE HAS QUITE A FOLLOWING OF THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS ATTACHES THEM TO THE COURTS AND WHILE MANY CLAIM THIS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST OF ITS CLASS WE BELIEVE THE CLAIM TO BE BASED LESS ON GOOD COOKING THAN ON THE FACT THAT THE HABITUES ARE INTIMATE MAKING IT A PLEASANT RESORT FOR THEM
CLAMS AND ABALONE'S WE CANNOT DISPOSE OF THE SHELL FISH OF SAN FRANCISCO WITHOUT A WORD OR TWO ABOUT CLAMS FOR CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PLACE WHERE THEY ARE IN GREATER VARIETY AND BETTER FLAVOR
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE WHEN YOU WENT TO A RESTAURANT AND ORDERED FISH OR OYSTERS THE WAITER INVARIABLY PUT BEFORE YOU EITHER A PLATE OF CRAB SALAD OR A DISH OF SHRIMPS WITH WHICH YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO AMUSE YOURSELF WHILE THE MEAL WAS BEING PREPARED
BARBERS USE EGGS AND THEY MUST BE FRESH ONES IN SHAMPOOING AND OUR FRIEND REMEMBERED IT
HERE IN MONTGOMERY STREET BETWEEN JACKSON AND PACIFIC WAS THE RENDEZVOUS OF PIONEERS AND HERE THE SOCIETY OF CALIFORNIA PIONEERS HAD ITS INCEPTION RECEIVING IMPRESSIONS FELT TO THE PRESENT DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND CALIFORNIA HISTORY
AT EACH SERVING SOME ONE DRANK TO SOME ONE ELSE THEN A RETURN OF THE COMPLIMENT WAS NECESSARY
SPANISH BEEFSTEAK CUT THE STEAK INTO PIECES THE SIZE DESIRED FOR SERVING
WE ASKED FOR THE RECIPE THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE VERY BEST IN THE RESTAURANT AND HIRSCH WITH A SHRUG OF HIS SHOULDERS SAID
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELICIOUS DISHES HE PREPARED AND THE WONDERFUL RECIPES THE QUANTITY SERVED WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE POSSESSED OF ENORMOUS CAPACITY INDEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY AT THE END OF THE MEAL THAT HE HAD EATEN ALL THAT WAS GIVEN HIM
DRESS ON A SMALL ROUND PLANK ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER DECORATED WITH A BORDER OF MASHED POTATOES
ADD TWO CUPS OF LIGHT BROWN SUGAR AND MIX WELL
WE HAVE VISITED THE COAST MANY TIMES AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND BEYOND THE UNCONCEALED LICENSE OF OPEN CARESSES WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING SHOCKING TO OUR MORAL SENSE THAT EQUALED WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN BROADWAY NEW YORK OR IN SOME OF THE MOST FASHIONABLE HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
THESE MAY BE CONSIDERED THE MOST PROMINENT OF THE PASTES THE OTHERS BEING VARIANTS IN THE MAKING AND CUTTING EACH SERVING A SPECIAL PURPOSE IN COOKING SOME BEING FOR SOUPS OTHERS FOR SAUCES AND OTHERS FOR DRESSING FOR MEATS
BUT FOR REAL INTEREST ONE MUST GET BACK TO THE SLOPE OF TELEGRAPH HILL
IT WAS ALL FREE AND EASY AND NOBODY TOOK OFFENSE AT ANYTHING SAID OR DONE
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO BUY THEM A DRINK IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE ARE BOHEMIANS AND NEAR-BOHEMIANS AND IF YOU ARE LIKE THE YOUNG WOMAN MENTIONED YOU ARE APT TO MISS THE REAL AND TAKE THE IMITATION FOR THE GENUINE ARTICLE
THAT IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO TRY NEW THINGS
THEN THERE IS SOLE BOTH IN THE FILLET AND REX AS PREPARED AT JULE'S UNDER THE MONADNOCK BUILDING
IT IS THE MOST DELICIOUS WAY CHICKEN WAS EVER COOKED THIS IS THE RECIPE AS COPPA GAVE IT TO US HIS LITTLE WIFE STANDING AT HIS SIDE AND GIVING NOW AND THEN A SUGGESTION AS COPPA'S MEMORY HALTED
DO NOT OTHER CITIES HAVE EQUALLY AS GOOD CHEFS AND DO NOT THE PEOPLE OF OTHER CITIES HAVE EQUALLY AS FINE GASTRONOMIC TASTE
BEFORE TAKING FROM THE PAN ADD HALF A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER AND SERVE ON A HOT PLATE
IN THE REAR ROOM WHICH WAS REACHED BY A DEVIOUS PATH THROUGH THE DEBRIS HE HAD A BAR WHERE HE SERVED THE FINEST OF IMPORTED LIQUORS FRENCH BRANDY SPANISH WINES ENGLISH ALE ALL IN THE ORIGINAL WOOD
WE HAVE CONSIDERED OURSELVES FORTUNATE IN BEING TAKEN INTO THE CONFIDENCE OF ONE OF THE DESCENDANTS OF SENORA BENICIA VALLEJO AND HONORED WITH SOME OF HER PRIZE RECIPES WHICH FIND PLACE IN THIS BOOK NOT AS THE FAMOUS RECIPE OF SOME BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS BUT AS THE TRIBUTE TO THE SPIRIT OF THE LAND THAT MADE THOSE BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS POSSIBLE
MIX BUTTER AND OLIVE OIL AND HEAT IN A FRYING PAN AND INTO THIS PUT THE SLICES OF CORN MEAL FRYING TO A LIGHT BROWN
WHAT IS PROVIDED IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE BILL OF FARE AS IT WAS SERVED US
THEY SERVE TABLE D'HOTE DINNERS BUT YOU CAN ALSO GET SPANISH DISHES ON SPECIAL ORDER
AS SOON AS THE COLORED CRAWFISH BUTTER IS BECOME FIRMLY SET THROUGH THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER TAKE IT OUT AND PUT IT INTO A SMALL BASIN AND SET IN THE REFRIGERATOR UNTIL WANTED
NOTHING IN THE PLACE INDICATES ITS CHARACTER EXCEPT THE BIG LOBSTER IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING
HE STRUGGLED AGAINST HARD TIMES AND AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING HE WITH HIS WIFE THEIR SON AND HIS WIFE ARE GIVING THE OLD-TIME DINNERS AND TRYING TO MAKE THE VENTURE A SUCCESS
IT WAS PREPARED AS FOLLOWS
DANCING SINGING AND MUSIC--ALL THAT IS EMBODIED IN THE WINE WOMEN AND SONG OF THE POETS WAS TO BE FOUND THERE BUT IT WAS OPEN AND HAD NONE OF THE VEILED SUGGESTION TO BE FOUND IN PLACES CONSIDERED AMONG THE BEST
SO FAR AS EATING WAS CONCERNED THAT WAS NOT ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WHEN DISCUSSING SANGUINETTI'S
BOTH OF THESE RESTAURANTS ARE OF THE OLD FRENCH TYPE AND ARE HIGH CLASS IN EVERY RESPECT
UNDER THE MONADNOCK BUILDING IN MARKET STREET NEAR THIRD IS JULE'S WELL LIKED AND WELL PATRONIZED BECAUSE OF ITS GOOD COOKING AND GOOD SERVICE
THIS IS THE RECIPE OF ERNEST ARBOGAST THE CHEF FOR MANY YEARS OF THE OLD PALACE
AS ONE GOES UP WITH THE SCALE OF PRICES IN THE RESTAURANTS THAT CHARGE $1 $1.25 $1.50 $2 $2.50 AND $3 FOR THEIR DINNERS IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE DIFFERENCE LIES CHIEFLY IN THE VARIETY FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE AND FROM THE SURROUNDINGS AND SERVICE
IN NEW YORK CITY THEY HAVE WHAT THEY ARE PLEASED TO CALL LOBSTER PALACES BUT THERE IS NOT A RESTAURANT IN THAT GREAT METROPOLIS THAT COULD APPROACH THE DELMONICO OF SAN FRANCISCO IN ITS SPLENDID SERVICE AND ITS CUISINE ARRANGEMENTS
TO THE BEATEN YOLKS ADD ONE POUND OF GRANULATED SUGAR BEATING UNTIL FULLY BLENDED AND VERY LIGHT
THEY ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE TO THE BLUE POINT BUT LACK THE FLAVOR
WHAT IS TRUE OF GARLIC IS ALSO TRUE OF THE MANY HERBS THAT ARE USED
AT THE HEIDELBERG INN ONE NEED NEVER FEAR OBTRUSIVENESS ON THE PART OF OTHER VISITORS FOR HERE EVERYBODY ATTENDS STRICTLY TO HIS OR HER OWN PARTY ENJOYING A CAMARADERIE THAT HAS ALL THE GENUINE WHOLE-SOULED COMPANIONSHIP FOUND ONLY WHERE GERMAN FAMILIES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONGREGATE TO SEEK RELAXATION FROM THE TOIL AND WORRY OF THE DAY
AS YOU GO OUT INTO THE STREET YOU BLINK AT THE TRANSFORMATION FOR YOU HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY
SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF THE INTERIOR OF THE AQUARIUM IN BATTERY PARK IN NEW YORK
IT WAS A LITTLE RAMSHACKLE BUILDING EXTENDING BACK THROUGH TWO OR THREE ROOMS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF OLD CURIOS SUCH AS COMES FROM SAILING VESSELS THAT GO TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD
EELS COME FROM CHINA AND THEY ARE COOKED CHINA STYLE TOO
TAKE HALF A POUND OF RED PEPPERS SCALDED AND SEEDED AND GRIND FINE WITH BLACK PEPPERS CELERY SEED CLOVES ALLSPICE AND MUSTARD ABOUT HALF A TEASPOONFUL OF EACH AND ADD TO THIS SOME OF THE BROTH IN WHICH THE TURKEY WAS COOKED
HERE ARE WINES FROM THE COLDER SLOPES OF MOUNTAINS
TORTELLINI WITH FUNGI A FUNGHETTO
WHERE FISH ABOUND ACCORDING TO DAVID STARR JORDAN ACKNOWLEDGED WORLD AUTHORITY ON FISH THERE IS GREATER VARIETY OF FISH IN MONTEREY BAY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
IN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY COOKING IS A DUTY USUALLY CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE NECESSARY EVILS OF EXISTENCE AND FOOD IS PREPARED AS IT IS USUALLY EATEN--HASTILY--SOMETHING TO FILL THE STOMACH
THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU FOR THE COOK KNOWS AND NOBODY ELSE
THE TEHAMA HOUSE WAS THE RENDEZVOUS OF ARMY AND NAVY OFFICERS AND HIGH STATE OFFICIALS
THE TRUE LOBSTER IS NOT FOUND IN THE PACIFIC ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND SO FAR EFFORTS AT TRANSPLANTING HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
WE DISCOVERED HIM ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD ON DISPLAY A VEGETABLE THAT WAS STRANGE TO US
A GOOD DINNER OF SEVEN OR EIGHT COURSES WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED COULD BE HAD IN THESE PLACES FOR FIFTY CENTS
PUT IN THE CORN MEAL GRADUALLY UNTIL IT MAKES A STIFF MUSH THEN COOK FOR HALF AN HOUR WITH THE MEAT
THE AMOUNT OF THE TIP DEPENDS FIRST ON THE SERVICE SECOND ON THE AMOUNT OF THE BILL AND THIRD ON THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE SERVED
AT THE NEW BUON GUSTO YOU WILL FIND A MOST EXCELLENT CIPPINO WITH POLENTI AND IF YOU HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THIS WE ADVISE YOU TO TRY IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
WHILE WE WERE TALKING IT OVER AND MAKING PLANS FOR THE WEDDING ANOTHER FRIEND DROPPED IN BECAUSE HE SAID OUR LIGHT LOOKED INVITING AN HOUR OR SO OF TALK AND THEN ONE OF US SIGNALED TO THE OTHER AND RECEIVED THE SHOCKING SIGNAL BACK THERE'S NOT A THING TO EAT IN THE HOUSE THIS CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF THE LARDER IN WHICH ALL JOINED WITH THE FOLLOWING RESULT
AMID A DIN ALMOST DEAFENING BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED WITH SUCH CELERITY THAT IN THREE HOURS THE STREETS WERE CLEARED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES SOLD AND ON THEIR WAY TO DISTANT STANDS AND THE TIRED POLICEMEN LEANING AGAINST FRIENDLY WALLS RECUPERATING AFTER THE STRENUOUS WORK OF KEEPING ORDER IN CHAOS
POSSIBLY THEY WILL SMILE AT YOUR IGNORANCE WHEN YOU ASK THEM QUESTIONS BUT DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK FOR THEY ARE COURTEOUS AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIND OUT THINGS AND LEARN WHAT ALL THESE NEW EDIBLES ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE GOOD FOR
SALAD
SALAD
WITH THIS IS SERVED A PINT OF GOOD TABLE WINE
CUT IN JULIENNE ONE STALK OF CELERY ONE GREEN PEPPER ONE CUCUMBER TWO OR THREE TOMATOES DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE
GREATER ALCOHOLIC STRENGTH AND OF FINE FLAVOR
CHOP ONE LARGE ONION FINE
WHEN WE WERE SEATED IN CAME TWO LITTLE JAPANESE WOMEN IN FULL NATIVE COSTUME BEARING A SERVICE OF TEA
FINE STRIPED BASS FROM THE OCEAN OR BLACK BASS FROM THE FRESH WATER TAKES HIGH PLACE IN PREFERENCE
COOK SLOWLY FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND THEN STRAIN
CHILI REINAS ROAST LARGE BELL PEPPERS UNTIL THE SKIN TURNS BLACK
SOLE EDWARD VII CUT THE FILLETS OUT OF ONE SOLE AND LAY THEM FLAT ON A BUTTERED PAN AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER
THE FRENCH PEASANT STYLE CAME A LITTLE LATER BEGINNING IN A LITTLE DINING ROOM OPENED IN WASHINGTON STREET JUST ABOVE KEARNY BY A FRENCH WOMAN WHOSE NAME WAS A CAREFULLY GUARDED SECRET
THEN CAME A DESSERT OF UNUSUAL FLAVOR AND APPEARANCE FOLLOWED BY PRESERVED GINGER AND FRUIT
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO LET THE EMPTIED BOTTLES REMAIN ON THE TABLE UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE MEAL AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY SHOWING
SAN FRANCISCO AND THE PALACE HOTEL WERE ALMOST SYNONYMOUS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IT WAS CONCEDED BY TRAVELERS THAT NOWHERE ELSE WAS THERE A HOSTELRY TO EQUAL THIS GREAT HOTEL
EITHER VEAL OR PORK MAY BE USED INSTEAD OF CHICKEN
CHICKEN JAMBALAYA CUT A YOUNG CHICKEN INTO SMALL PIECES AND STEW UNTIL TENDER HAVING THE MEAT COVERED WITH THE BROTH WHEN DONE
LOMBARDI'S WAS OF THE SAME TYPE BUT HIS PRICE WAS BUT TWENTY-FIVE CENTS FOR A COURSE DINNER IN MANY RESPECTS THE EQUAL OF THE OTHERS
THE FACT IS THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS WOULD BE FAR LESS INTERESTING WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY CAN SECURE THE DELICACIES IMPORTED BY THESE FOREIGN STOREKEEPERS TO SUPPLY THE WANTS OF THEIR PEOPLE
FIRST WE WENT THROUGH THE MARKET FROM END TO END AND ALL THE SIDE AISLES SPYING OUT THE LAND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ENUMERATE WHAT WE SAW
A LIGHT PLEASING AND WHOLESOME WINE
RAISE THE FILLETS FROM THE BONE SKIN AND PARE NICELY AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PAPRIKA
GRAFFENBERG
CHATTERING MONKEYS AND PARROTS WERE HANGING AROUND THE KITCHEN PEERING INTO POTS AND FINGERING VIANDS AND THEY SERVED TO ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM MYRIADS OF COCKROACHES THAT SWARMED ABOUT THE WALLS
LET ALL SIMMER BUT NOT BOIL OR LET COLOR
MIXED FRUITS
LET THIS SIMMER GENTLY AND THEN CAREFULLY BREAK ON TOP THE NUMBER OF EGGS DESIRED
AMONG THE RESTAURANTS DESERVING OF SPECIAL MENTION IN THIS DISTRICT ARE THE TWO SOLARIS
THE GRILL OF THE OLD PALACE HOTEL WAS ALSO OF HIGHEST ORDER AND THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE LADIES GRILL WHICH WAS THEN AS NOW NOTED FOR ITS ARTISTIC PREPARATION OF A WONDROUS VARIETY OF GOOD THINGS
IT DIFFERS FROM SCRAPPLE IN THAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE MIXED IN A SAUCE AND POURED OVER THE MUSH INSTEAD OF BEING MIXED IN THE MEAL
THE CUPS AND SAUCERS WERE OF A MOST DELICATE BLUE AND WHITE WARE WITH TEAPOT TO MATCH
WITH COFFEE SERVE KIRCH FRENCH BRANDY OR FINE CHAMPAGNE
FILL THE GLASS WITH ICE AND POUR OVER IT A JIGGER OF WHISKY
LET IT BOIL BRISKLY FOR FIVE MINUTES ONLY THEN SET ON THE BACK OF THE STOVE FIVE MINUTES
PUT INTO A COFFEEPOT THE COFFEE MIXTURE AND ADD FOUR LARGE CUPS OF BOILING WATER STIRRING CONSTANTLY
THEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE ROASTING PAN AND PUT IT INTO A CASSEROLE AFTER SPRINKLING IT WITH TWO OUNCES OF FLOUR
HERE ARE LABELS THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WINES THAT YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD OF
GREEN SALAD WITH FRENCH DRESSING
THEY ALSO HAVE AS THE CHEF IN CHARGE OF THE ABALONE DISHES HERBERT FORMERLY CHEF FOR ONE OF THE YACHT CLUBS OF THE COAST WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE THE ONLY PROPER RECIPE FOR MAKING ABALONE'S TENDER
WOODS WERE HERE FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD EACH BEING DISTINCTIVE
ACCORDING TO AN ITALIAN FRIEND WHO VOUCHES FOR THE FACT IT RECEIVED ITS NAME FROM AN EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE
ADD THE YOLKS OF TWO EGGS AND LET COOK TWO MINUTES
EACH HERB HAS A PECULIAR QUALITY AS A STOMACHIC AND IT MUST BE AS DELICATELY MEASURED AS IF IT WERE A MEDICINE
FIORINI FOR INSTANCE AT A POINT A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE COSTA BROTHERS
WHAT IS TRUE OF THE STORES IS ALSO TRUE OF THE VEGETABLE STANDS THE MEAT SHOPS THE FISH STALLS AND BAKERIES
SOMALI'S SPECIALTIES WERE ROAST TURKEY CHATEAUBRIAND STEAK AND COFFEE FRAPPE
ABOUT DINING TABLE D'HOTE IS THE FEATURE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S RESTAURANT LIFE
THE FOLLOWING DON'TS ARE ADDED TO THE RECIPE
HERE YOU CAN GET A GOOD DINNER FOR ONE DOLLAR OR IF YOU PREFER IT THEY HAVE A FISH DINNER DE LUXE FOR WHICH THEY CHARGE TWO DOLLARS
NOISE WAS RATHER INVITED THAN FROWNED UPON AND THE ONLY LINE DRAWN REGARDING CONDUCT WAS THE THROWING OF BREAD
CRACKLING CORN BREAD IS THE FIRST STEP AND HERE WE FIND THAT THE DARKIES OF THE SOUTH FOUND GOOD USE FOR THE REMNANTS OF THE PORK AFTER LARD WAS TRIED OUT AT HOG-KILLING TIME BY MIXING THE CRACKLINGS WITH THEIR CORN MEAL AND MAKING A PONE WHICH THEY COOKED BEFORE AN OPEN FIRE ON A HOE BLADE THE FIRST OF THIS BEING CALLED CRACKLIN HOE CAKE GOOD SCRAPPLE IS ONE OF THE FINEST BREAKFAST DISHES THAT WE KNOW DURING THE WINTER AND WHEN PREPARED AFTER THE RECIPE GIVEN HERE IT PRECEDES ALL OTHER FORMS OF SERVING CORN MEAL
COPPA EMULATED THE NEW IDEA BY FITTING OUT A GORGEOUS BASEMENT ROOM AT THE CORNER OF KEARNY AND JACKSON WHICH HE CALLED THE NEPTUNE PALACE

BEFORE THE MEAL WAS OVER SEVERAL OF US BECAME QUITE EXPERT IN USING THE CHOPSTICKS
ITS SPECIALTY WAS MARROW ON TOAST AND BROILED MUSHROOMS AND GAME
THEY DO NOT FIND IT NECESSARY TO PUSH EXHILARATION TO INTOXICATION
THE FOLLOWING MENU WILL GIVE SOME IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO THIS AFTER A BRISK RIDE OUT THROUGH GOLDEN GATE PARK YOU HAVE THE GREAT SAUCE APPETITE AND WITH A POT OF STEAMING COFFEE WHOSE AROMA RISES LIKE THE INCENSE TO THE SEA GODS YOU WILL FEEL THAT WHILE YOU HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD GOOD BREAKFASTS BEFORE THIS YOU KNOW THAT NOW YOU ARE HAVING THE BEST OF THEM ALL

DESIRING TO OBSERVE IN FITTING MANNER A BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY WE ASKED A JAPANESE FRIEND IF HE COULD SECURE ADMISSION FOR A LITTLE PARTY AT A RESTAURANT NOTED FOR SERVING NONE BUT THE HIGHEST CLASS JAPANESE
THAT WE CANNOT PRINT THEM ALL IN A VOLUME OF THIS SIZE IS OUR REGRET BUT ANOTHER BOOK NOW IN PREPARATION WILL CONTAIN THEM TOGETHER WITH OTHER TALKS ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO'S FOREIGN QUARTERS
OH HE'S ONE FINE COOK
YOU BEGIN TO LEARN OF THE MANY USES OF OLIVE OIL IN COOKING AND IN FOOD PREPARATION
DO THEY DESIRE ANY SPECIAL DELICACY FROM THEIR HOME DISTRICT THEY NEED BUT GO TO THE NEAREST ITALIAN GROCERY STORE AND GET IT FOR THESE STORES ARE SUPPLIED DIRECT FROM GENOA OR NAPLES
TAKE OFF HALF SHELLS AND PLACE THE MUSSELS IN A CHAFING DISH AND POUR OVER THEM BECHAMEL SAUCE AND THEN ADD SUFFICIENT MILK GRAVY TO COVER
THICKEN A LITTLE AND THEN SIMMER IN THIS THE STALKS AND PEELINGS OF A QUARTER OF A POUND OF MUSHROOMS AND THE CHICKEN THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PREPARED AND DUSTED WITH FLOUR
BUT THEY ARE HARMLESS ANARCHISTS IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR HERE THEY HAVE NO WRONGS TO REDRESS SO THEY SIT AND DRINK THEIR FORBIDDEN ABSINTHE AND DREAM THEIR DREAMS OF FIRE AND SWORD WHILE THEY TALK IN WHISPERS OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO TO THE CROWNED HEADS OF EUROPE
A VERY RARE AND COSTLY WINE OF RICH RUBY COLOR WITH A DELICATE BOUQUET
THE MYTHICAL LAND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT WEBSTER GIVES NO RECOGNITION IN HIS DICTIONARY TO THE LAND OF BOHEMIA OR THE OCCUPANTS THEREOF THE LAND EXISTS PERHAPS NOT IN A MATERIAL WAY BUT CERTAINLY MENTALLY
GO TO THE WHARVES AND SEE THEM COME AND AND GO TO THE WHOLESALE MARKETS DOWN IN CLAY STREET BELOW MONTGOMERY

WITH HOR D'OURVES SERVE VERMOUTH SHERRY MARSALA OR MADEIRA WINE
BIRTH OF THE FRENCH RESTAURANT FRENCH IMPRESSION CAME STRONGLY ABOUT THIS TIME AND THE POODLE DOG OF PARIS HAD ITS PROTOTYPE AT BUSH AND DUPONT STREETS
TWO RAW YOLKS OF EGGS TWO BOILED YOLKS OF EGGS ONE OUNCE OF BUTTER ONE OUNCE CORN STARCH
SOMETHING ABOUT COOKING COOKING IS SOMETIMES A PLEASURE SOMETIMES A DUTY SOMETIMES A BURDEN AND SOMETIMES A MARTYRDOM ALL ACCORDING TO THE POINT OF VIEW
WE ATE THE SOUP AND SALAD AND FOUND IT GOOD AND THEN MADE TENTATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE CAKE TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE WE DISCOVERED THE ANGEL FOOD TO BE FISH AND THE ICING WAS SHREDDED AND PRESSED LOBSTER
HERE ONE CAN GET THE FINEST ITALIAN PEASANT MEAL IN THE CITY AND MANY OF THE ITALIAN MERCHANTS AND BANKERS STILL GO THERE FOR THEIR LUNCHEONS EVERY DAY PREFERRING IT TO THE MORE PRETENTIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS
AT THE GIANDUJA YOU GET THE TWO PRIME ESSENTIALS TO A GOOD MEAL--GOOD COOKING AND EXCELLENT SERVICE
SNAILS A LA BORDELAISE PUT TEN POUNDS OF SNAILS IN A COVERED BARREL AND KEEP FOR TEN DAYS
TORTELLINI DI BOLOGNA SOUP
HERE ARE REPRESENTED THE NATIONS OF EARTH IN SUCH DISTINCTIVE COLONIES THAT ONE MIGHT WELL IMAGINE HIMSELF POSSESSED OF THE MAGIC CARPET TOLD OF IN ARABIAN NIGHTS TALES AS HE IS TRANSPORTED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY
BROIL ON A GRIDIRON OVER A CLEAR SHARP FIRE AND SERVE THEM WITH THE FOLLOWING SAUCE
NO SLUMMING PARTY WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT A VISIT TO THE COAST AFTER CHINATOWN'S MANUFACTURED HORRORS HAD BEEN SHUDDERED AT
IT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE FACT THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOTEL ST FRANCIS WAS UNDAUNTED IN THE FACE OF ALMOST OVERWHELMING DISASTER
BOHEMIAN SAN FRANCISCO
UP TO THE TIME OF THE CLOSING OF BARBARY COAST MOLESTATION OF WOMEN ON THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO WAS ALMOST UNHEARD OF
THE ITALIAN MOTHER HAS BUT TWO THOUGHTS--HER GOD AND HER CHILDREN AND IT IS TO CARE FOR HER CHILDREN THAT SHE HAS BROUGHT FROM HER NATIVE LAND THE KNOWLEDGE OF COOKERY AND OF THOSE THINGS THAT HELP TO PUT LIFE AND STRENGTH IN THEIR BODIES

NOW GOING A STEP UP IN THE SCALE WE COME TO THE $1.50 DINNER AS FOLLOWS
ADD ONE CUP OF HOT SOUP STOCK STIRRING CONSTANTLY
AT 6:30 WE CALLED AT THE ROOMS OF THE GOVERNOR IN THE PALACE HOTEL AND HAD SERVED THERE DRY MARTINI COCKTAILS WITH RUSSIAN CAVIAR ON TOASTED RYE BREAD
TO THIS ADD ONE GILL OF FRENCH BRANDY OR ONE-HALF PINT OF GOOD WHISKY
IF BUT THE FOOD VALUE BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THEN ONE WILL BE AS WELL PLEASED WITH THE FIFTY-CENT DINNER AS HE WILL BE AT THE HIGHER PRICED MEALS BUT IF LIGHT AND MUSIC AND BRILLIANT SURROUNDINGS ARE DESIRED THEN ONE MUST PAY FOR THEM AS WELL AS FOR THE MEAL HE EATS
GOOD AND STRONG
DON'T SUBSTITUTE CORN STARCH AND MILK FOR CREAM
YOU SEE WE HAVE FISH FINS THEY ARE VERY GOOD
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME OUR THEATRICAL FRIENDS HAD TASTED SAND-DABS FOR THIS FISH HAS COME TO SAN FRANCISCO MARKETS ONLY IN RECENT YEARS AND THEY DECLARED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY FISH FIT TO BE EATEN
STRAIN OFF THE LIQUOR AND BOIL WITH CORN MEAL ADDING THE CHOPPED MEAT
THERE IS LITTLE OF THE OBNOXIOUS POSING THAT ONE FINDS IN RESTAURANTS OF THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS FOR WHILE ITALIANS IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER LATINS ARE NATURAL BORN POSEURS THEY ARE NOT OFFENSIVE IN IT BUT RATHER IMPRESS YOU WITH THE SAME FEELING AS THE ANTICS OF A CHILD
AFTER ONE EATS TAGLIARINI OR RAVIOLI ONE FEELS LIKE PARAPHRASING THE DARKEY AND SAYING GO WAY SPAGHETTI YO DONE LOS YO TASE THEN COMES TORTELINI WHICH LIKE RAVIOLI COMBINES PASTE WITH MEAT AND SPINACH
TAKE THE REST OF THE CHICKEN WITH THE GIBLETS AND CHOP SMALL
ESCALLOP OF VEAL CAPER SAUCE
AT JACK'S STRIPED BASS COOKED IN WINE IS WHAT WE THINK THE BEST OF THE FISH TO BE FOUND IN THE MARKET OR AT THE RESTAURANTS COOKED THAT WAY
LAZZARINI ALSO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF SNAILS AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH TRYING WHILE YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THE UNUSUAL THINGS TO EAT
TAKE THAT OF P
CUT UP AND FRY IN CHICKEN FAT TWO ONIONS TWO GREEN PEPPERS STIRRING IN ONE AND ONE-HALF TABLESPOONFULS OF FLOUR
YET IT AS TRULY EXISTS AS ANY OF THE LANDS TOLD OF IN OUR CHILDHOOD FABLES AND FAIRY STORIES
CUT AROUND THE STEM AND REMOVE THE SEED AND COARSE VEINS
IT IS ALSO WELL TO BEAR IN MIND THAT IT IS NOT IN THE LARGEST STORES THAT YOU FIND THE GREATEST VARIETY WHEN IT COMES TO ODD AND NEW GOODS
HERTZLER HAS ANOTHER RECIPE WHICH HE PRIZES GREATLY AND WHICH HE CALLS CELERY VICTOR AND THIS IS THE RECIPE WHICH HE GAVE US
MUCH ROMANCE ATTACHED TO PIERRE IT BEING GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT HE BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FRENCH FAMILY BECAUSE OF HIS EDUCATION HIS UNFAILING COURTESY HIS READY WIT AND HIS GENTILITY
THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE OUTSIDE TO INDICATE THAT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A RESIDENCE BUT WHEN WE WERE USHERED INTO THE LARGE FRONT ROOM WE FOUND IT BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH IMMENSE CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND GLITTERING WITH SILVER AND CUT GLASS ON A MAGNIFICENTLY ARRANGED TABLE
THE FOLLOWING RECIPE FOR TAMALES WAS GIVEN US BY LUNA
WHEN READY FOR COOKING TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE BRINE AND PUT IN A ROASTING PAN
TIPO CHIANTI MADE BY THE ASTI COLONY
THE BEST VINTAGE YEARS ARE AS FOLLOWS
DIP THE PIECES OF CHICKEN INTO THE BATTER UNTIL WELL COATED AND SET ASIDE UNTIL IT IS COLD
CHICKEN IN A SHELL INTO A KETTLE CONTAINING A QUART OF WATER PUT A YOUNG CHICKEN ONE SLICED ONION A BAY LEAF TWO CLOVES A BLADE OF MACE AND SIX PEPPER-CORNS
OF COURSE OUR FRIENDS IN PORTLAND WILL TAKE EXCEPTION TO THIS BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT NOWHERE EXCEPT IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE SO MANY RESTAURANTS BECOME FAMOUS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY PREPARE THE CRAB
HE PROTESTED THAT THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD THINGS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAME JUST ONE AS BEING THE BEST
HERE WAS EMPHASIZED THE SPIRIT OF BOHEMIAN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST MERRY AND ENJOYABLE OF FEASTS EVER HELD IN THE CITY
INSTEAD OF ORDERING THESE BY THE DOZEN YOU ORDER THEM BY THE HUNDRED IT BEING NO DIFFICULT TASK TO EAT AN HUNDRED AT A MEAL ESPECIALLY WHEN PREPARED IN A PEPPER ROAST
THESE ARE MOST DELICIOUS IN FLAVOR AND SHOULD NEVER BE EATEN OTHERWISE THAN RAW
IT IMMEDIATELY HARDENS FORMING A DELICIOUS CARAMEL COVERING TO THE ICE CREAM
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PASTE FACTORIES ALL GOOD AND ALL CLEAN
WE DRINK ALONE TO WHAT WILL LAST
THOMPSON'S WAS ANOTHER PLACE THAT WAS TOO ELABORATE FOR ITS PATRONAGE AND AFTER A VARIED EXISTENCE FROM THE OLD OYSTER LOAF TO A CAFETERIA THOMPSON WAS COMPELLED TO LEAVE FOR OTHER FIELDS AND SAN FRANCISCO LOST A SPLENDID RESTAURATEUR
FOR THOSE WHO LIKE GERMAN DISHES AND GERMAN COOKING IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE HEIDELBERG INN FOR BOTH THE HOF BRAU IN MARKET JUST ABOVE FOURTH STREET AND THE GERMAN HOUSE RATHSKELLER AT TURK AND POLK STREETS ARE GOOD PLACES WHERE YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANT
WHEN THICK ADD TWO AND A HALF CUPS OF THICK CREAM
STIR ALL TOGETHER AND BAKE UNTIL BROWN
ONE MAY ALWAYS REST ASSURED THAT WHEN HE GETS A FISH IN ONE OF THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS IT IS PERFECTLY FRESH FOR THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT AN ITALIAN DEMANDS IN EATING AND THEY ARE FRESH FISH AND FRESH VEGETABLES
AS ORIGINALLY PREPARED THE TAMALE WAS MADE FOR CONVEYANCE HENCE THE WRAPPINGS OF CORN HUSK
OLD PIERRE OF LATER DAYS WHO WAS FOUND DEAD OUT ON THE COLMA ROAD SOME TWO YEARS AFTER THE FIRE OF 1906 WAS A WAITER AT THE POODLE DOG WHEN IT STARTED AND BY SAVING HIS TIPS AND MAKING GOOD INVESTMENTS HE WAS ABLE TO OPEN A SIMILAR RESTAURANT AT STOCKTON AND MARKET WHICH HE CALLED THE PUP
CLAM CHOWDER TAKE ONE QUART OF SHELLED SAND CLAMS TWO LARGE POTATOES TWO LARGE ONIONS ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC ONE SWEET PEPPER ONE THICK SLICE OF SALT PORK ONE-HALF POUND SMALL OYSTER CRACKERS ONE-HALF GLASS SHERRY ONE TABLESPOONFUL WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE ONE TOMATO SALT AND PEPPER
TRUE MANY OF THE OLD NAMES HAVE BEEN RETAINED OR REVIVED BUT THERE IS NOT FELT THE OLD SPIRIT OF CAMARADERIE
TELL HIM HOW MANY WILL BE IN THE PARTY AND GIVE HIM THE AMOUNT YOU WISH TO SPEND
SAN FRANCISCANS BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND TRANSIENT ARE A PLEASURE-LOVING PEOPLE AND DINING OUT IS A DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF THEIR PLEASURE
WE DOUBT IF IT CAN BE HAD ANYWHERE IN SAN FRANCISCO NOW UNLESS YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH KNOWN TO HAVE IT PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE
TAKE ONE LOAF OF STALE BREAD CRUMBS MOISTEN AND SQUEEZE AND ADD THREE TABLESPOONFULS OF GRATED CHEESE THREE CLOVES OF GARLIC BRUISED ONE ONION CHOPPED FINE SEVERAL SPRIGS OF PARSLEY CHOPPED FINE A LITTLE CELERY AND HALF A CUP OF OLIVE OIL
SWEET AND OF FINE BOUQUET AND FLAVOR
ENTERING THE PLACE ONE CAME INTO THE HOME LIFE OF THE LUNA FAMILY AND REACHED THE DINING ROOM THROUGH THE PARLOR WHERE MRS LUNA BUSY WITH HER DRAWN WORK AND ALL THE LITTLE LUNAS AND THE NEIGHBORS AND THEIR CHILDREN FOREGATHERED IN THE WINDOW SPACES BEHIND THE TORN NOTTINGHAM CURTAINS WHICH PARTIALLY CONCEALED THE INTERIOR FROM PASSERS ON THE STREET
THE VEIN OF HUMOR OF IRREPRESSIBLE EFFERVESCENCE OF SPIRIT BORN OF BOHEMIANISM GAVE TO THESE EATING PLACES HIGH SOUNDING NAMES AND MANY WERE COVERED WITH WITTY SIGNS WHICH LAUGHED IN THE FACE OF FATE
IT IS A PECULIARITY OF THE SPANIARD THAT HE DOES NOT WISH TO BE CLASSED AS A MEXICAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE MEXICAN IS ANGRY IF HE BE CALLED A SPANIARD
IN PLACE OF BREAD THEY SERVED TORTILLAS WHICH WERE ROLLED AND USED AS A SPOON OR FORK IF ONE WERE SO INCLINED
THE BACK PART OF THE PLACE WITH ENTRANCE ON SECOND STREET WAS DIVIDED OFF INTO LITTLE ROOMS WITH TABLES LARGE ENOUGH FOR FOUR
IT WAS THE BUON GUSTO
HAVING SEEN WE WERE TOLD TO GO AND SELECT WHAT WE WISHED TO HAVE FOR OUR DINNER AND THEN THE SELECTION BEGAN AND THERE WAS A FEAST OF BUYING FISH MEATS VEGETABLES AND DELICACIES OF ALL SORTS EVEN TO FRENCH PASTRY
AN AUTOMOBILE WAS IN WAITING AND AT SEVEN O'CLOCK WE WERE SET DOWN AT FELIX'S IN MONTGOMERY STREET WHERE A TABLE WAS READY FOR US AND ON IT WERE SERVED SALAMI OF VARIOUS KINDS ARTICHOKES IN OIL AND RIPE OLIVES
HE SPECIALIZED IN OYSTERS AND MANY OF HIS DISHES HAVE SURVIVED TO THE PRESENT DAY
WE MEAN NO DEROGATION OF SAN FRANCISCO'S RESTAURANTS WHEN WE SAY THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S HIGHEST FORM OF BOHEMIANISM IS RARELY IN EVIDENCE IN RESTAURANTS
WE HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS A LITTLE APARTMENT WHERE HE HAS KEPT BACHELOR'S HALL FOR MANY YEARS
ITALIAN RISOTTO SOAK TWO LEVEL TEACUPS OF RICE
THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN O'FARRELL STREET JUST ABOVE FILLMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE
THREE HOURS BEFORE COOKING POUR THE SHERRY OVER THE LOBSTER MEAT AND LET IT STAND UNTIL READY TO COOK
IN FACT THE CLAM IS THE ONLY BIVALVE OF THIS PART OF THE COAST THAT HAS A DISTINCTIVE AND GOOD FLAVOR
OF COURSE THESE ARE NOT THE ENTIRE MENUS BUT OF ALL THE WELL-PREPARED DISHES THESE ARE THEIR BEST
ITALIAN TURTA CUT VERY FINE THE TENDER PART OF ONE DOZEN ARTICHOKES
COVER AND LET SIMMER FOR THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES
LET ONE QUART OF FRESH MILK COME TO A BOIL AND POUR OVER THE YOLK OF EGG AND SUGAR STIRRING CONSTANTLY UNTIL WELL BLENDED
PUT IN SHALLOW PANS AND LET COOL
THE ABORIGINE PREPARED HIS CORN ON A STONE METATE AND MADE IT INTO CAKES BY PATTING IT WITH THE HAND THEN COOKED IT ON A HOT STONE BEFORE AN OPEN FIRE
HERE ARE CHEESES IN WONDERFUL VARIETY
TAKE A LAMB CHOP A PIECE OF CALF BRAIN ONE SWEETBREAD A SLICE OF VEAL A FRESH MUSHROOM SLICED ITALIAN SQUASH A PIECE OF ASPARAGUS OR OF CAULIFLOWER AND DIP THESE INTO A BATTER MADE OF AN EGG WELL BEATEN WITH A LITTLE FLOUR
STIR ALL OVER THE FIRE UNTIL THE OKRA IS THOROUGHLY WILTED THEN REMOVE THE LARGER BONES AND LET COOK THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR BEFORE SERVING
NO DRINK OF JOY OR SORROW
IN NEW YORK WE WERE MUCH IMPRESSED WITH THE STRESS THEY LAID ON THE SERVING OF SPAGHETTI AND ONE RESTAURANT WENT SO FAR AS TO ADVERTISE DINNERS GIVEN UNDER THE SPAGHETTI VINE IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS THE ONLY PASTE THEY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
A DESERT WINE OF GOOD FLAVOR AND FINE AROMA
AUSTRIAN BURGUNDY IS ONE OF THE FINEST WINES POSSESSING RICH FLAVOR AND FINE PERFUME
BARSAC
AN EVENING SPENT IN HEIDELBERG INN IS ONE REPLETE WITH CHARACTER STUDY THAT CANNOT BE EXCELLED ANYWHERE IN SAN FRANCISCO--AND THIS MEANS THAT EVERYBODY THERE IS WORTH WHILE AS A STUDY FROM THE LITTLE BALD-HEADED WAITER HEME AND THE BIG IMPOSING WAITER AUGUST TO THE HERR DOCTOR WHO COMES TO FORGET THE SERIOUS SURGICAL CASE THAT HAS BEEN WORRYING HIM AT THE HOSPITAL
IT COSTS THEM NOTHING CONSEQUENTLY THEY CAN ACT ON IT OR NOT AND IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
FOR INSTANCE HOW FEW OF US KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE MENU CARD
AT LEAST WE SUPPOSE THE BABIES ARE AS ACTIVE AS THE GOATS FOR THE SIDES OF THE HILL ARE ALIVE WITH THEM
ALL YOU CAN SEE FROM THE STREET AS YOU PASS AROUND THE CORNER FROM MARKET IS A SIGN AND SOME STAIRS LEADING DOWN INTO A BASEMENT BUT DO NOT DRAW BACK JUST BECAUSE IT IS A BASEMENT RESTAURANT FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL MISS ONE OF THE VERY FEW REAL BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO
ALL OF THESE NAMES ARE STILL TO BE SEEN OVER RESTAURANTS AND THEY ARE STILL IN THAT CLASS JULE'S POSSIBLY BEING BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE FIRE
IN THIS SAME DISTRICT IS THE MINT IN COMMERCIAL STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY STREETS
CLAM FRITTERS TAKE TWO DOZEN CLAMS WASHED THOROUGHLY AND DRAINED
WHILE BOILING PUT INTO THIS A HANDFUL OF RAISINS HANDFUL OF BLANCHED ALMONDS POUNDED HALF A LEMON SLICED THIN A FEW CLOVES A PINCH OF CINNAMON AND A LITTLE HORSERADISH
COPPA HAS MANY WONDERFUL DISHES TO SERVE AND HE DELIGHTS SO MUCH IN YOUR APPRECIATION THAT HE IS ALWAYS FEARFUL SOMETHING IS WRONG IF YOU FAIL TO DO FULL JUSTICE TO HIS MEAL
AS A HUMAN INTEREST STUDY IT WAS BETTER THAN A STUDY OF FISH
MEET US AT THE CALIFORNIA MARKET WAS THE TELEPHONE MESSAGE THAT CAME TO US AND WE WERE THERE FOR WE KNEW THAT SOMETHING GOOD WAS IN STORE FOR US
ANCHOVIES SALAMI NOTE THAT IT IS THE SAME AS ABOVE
TAKE THE WINGS DRUMSTICKS THIGHS AND TWO PIECES OF THE BREAST AND STEEP THEM IN COLD WATER HALF AN HOUR
JULE'S THE FLY TRAP THE ST GERMAIN AND THE COSMOS LAID CLAIM TO DISTINCTION THROUGH THEIR INEXPENSIVENESS UP TO THE TIME OF THE FIRE
TO US CAME COPPA IN TEARS
FROM FAR OUT AROUND THE FARALLONES FROM UP AROUND THE POTATO PATCH WITH ITS MOURNFUL FOG BELL CONSTANTLY TOLLING FROM DOWN THE COAST AS FAR AS MONTEREY BAY WHERE FISH ARE IN SUCH ABUNDANCE THAT IT IS SAID THEY HAVE TO GIVE A SIGNAL WHEN THEY WANT TO TURN AROUND FROM UP THE RIVERS COME FISH TO THE MAN WHO HAS GROWN FROM THE OWNER OF A SMALL SAIL BOAT TO BE THE POWER WHO CONTROLS PRICES OF ALL THE FISH THAT GO TO THE MARKETS OF THE CITY
OF COURSE IF ONE DESIRE TO LEARN VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING FOOD IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP BOTH EYES OPEN AND TO ASK MANY QUESTIONS SEEKING THE INFORMATION THAT SOMETIMES COMES FROM UNLOOKED FOR SOURCES
SMELT HERRING FLOUNDER SOLE ALL WENT AT EQUALLY LOW PRICES AND AS EACH BUYER SECURED HIS ALLOTMENT HE WENT HURRYING OFF THROUGH THE MIST AS SILENTLY AS THE FLOATING GULLS
SOFT-VOICED RITA WITH HER DEMURE AIR AND HER RESEMBLANCE TO EVANGELINE WITH HER CROSSED APRON STRINGS AND DELICATE FEATURES TAKES YOUR ORDER AND SOON COMES THE BOOMING SOUND FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE RANGE THAT ANNOUNCES TO ALL PATRONS AS WELL AS TO SOME WHO MAY BE IN THE VICINITY ON THE STREET THAT YOUR ORDER IS READY AND THEN EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE EATING
ONE WONDERS AT A TABLE D'HOTE DINNER OF SIX OR SEVEN COURSES FOR TWENTY-FIVE CENTS OR EVEN FOR HALF A DOLLAR AND ONE ACCUSTOMED TO BUYING MEATS FISH VEGETABLES AND FRUITS AT THE EXORBITANT PRICES CHARGED AT MOST OF THE MARKETS AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STANDS NOW SEES WHY THE THRIFTY FOREIGNER CAN MAKE AND SAVE MONEY WHILE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CAN HARDLY KEEP MORE THAN TWO JUMPS AHEAD OF THE SHERIFF
COMBINATION SALAD
IT IS SAID OF THE ISLANDS OF THE SOUTH SEAS THAT WHEN ONE EATS OF CERTAIN FRUIT IT CREATES SUCH A LONGING THAT THE MIND IS NEVER CONTENT UNTIL ANOTHER VISIT IS MADE
SALT TO TASTE
YOU SEE BOXES OF DRIED HERBS AND BEGIN TO REALIZE WHY YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO REPRODUCE CERTAIN FLAVORS YOU HAVE TASTED IN RESTAURANTS
CURIOS OF ALL SORTS WERE DISPLAYED ON THE WALLS AND AMONG THEM WERE MANY QUEER WOOD GROWTHS SHOWING ODD SHAPES AS WELL AS ODD COLORINGS
YOU WILL FIND DELIGHT AND EDUCATION IN VISITING THE MARKETS AND THE FOREIGN STORES WHERE ALL THE STRANGE AND UNUSUAL FOODS OF ALL NATIONS ARE TO BE FOUND
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPANISH AND MEXICAN COOKING IS LARGELY A MATTER OF SENTIMENT
THIS HETEROGENEOUS CONGLOMERATION WAS COVERED WITH YEARS OF DUST AND COBWEBS HENCE THE NAME
IN BOHEMIA WE SOMETIMES FIND IT WELL TO OVERLOOK SOILED TABLE NAPERY SANDED FLOOR OR UNTIDY APPEARANCE
WHEN DONE SERVE IN THE PAN BY PLACING IT ON A PLATTER WITH A NAPKIN UNDER IT
CHATEAU FILHOT
IT HAS TAKEN US YEARS OF PATIENT RESEARCH TO LEARN HOW THESE CHEFS PREPARE THEIR COMBINATIONS OF FISH FLESH FOWL AND HERBS IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT PUT THEM DOWN GIVING RECIPES OF DISHES WHOSE MEMORIES LINGER IN THE MINDS OF WORLD WANDERERS AND TO WHICH THEIR THOUGHTS REVERT WITH A SIGH AS THEY PARTAKE OF UNSATISFACTORY VIANDS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER COSMOPOLITAN CITIES
FIRST WE HAVE THE OLD SPANISH DAYS THE DAYS BEFORE THE GRINGO CAME THEN REIGNED CONVIVIALITY HELD WITHIN MOST DISCREET BOUNDS OF CONVENTION AND IT WOULD BE A MISNOMER INDEED TO CALL THE PRE-PIONEER DAYS OF SAN FRANCISCO BOHEMIAN IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD
INTO THESE WE ARRANGED THE FOOD THAT WAS UNCONSUMED AND WHEN WE WENT AWAY WE CARRIED IT WITH US
HE REPLIED
TO FREDERICK THE GREAT IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED THE NAMING OF THE GERMAN BREAD NOW CALLED PUMPERNICKEL
THIS PLACE WAS THE BEST PATRONIZED OF ALL THE BOHEMIAN RESORTS OF THE CITY UP TO THE TIME OF THE FIRE
IN THIS VENTURE PIERRE HAD A PARTNER TO WHOM HE SOLD OUT A FEW YEARS LATER AND THEN HE OPENED THE TORTONI IN O'FARRELL STREET WHICH BECAME ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE PRE-FIRE RESTAURANTS ITS TABLE D'HOTE DINNERS BEING CONSIDERED THE BEST IN THE CITY
ARTISTIC JAPAN WE WISH IT WERE IN OUR POWER TO DESCRIBE A CERTAIN DINNER AS SERVED US IN A JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED THE GREAT FIRE
THE GRAPES ARE POURED INTO A BIG TUB AND A BURLY MAN TAKES OFF HIS SHOES AND SOCKS AND EMULATES THE OXEN OF BIBLICAL TIMES WHEN IT TREADED OUT THE GRAIN
PLEASURE-LOVING SAN FRANCISCO
HERE IS WHERE KEITH HAD HIS EARLY STUDIO
HAVE A DISH OF WELL BOILED AND DRY RICE AND SERVE WITH TWO OR THREE TABLESPOONFULS IN EACH SOUP PLATE
A FINE FAT CRAB FOR WHICH YOUR MARKET MAN WOULD CHARGE YOU FORTY CENTS WAS SOLD FOR TEN
TAKE SOME DRY MONTEREY CHEESE GRATED FINE AND WITH THIS FILL THE PEPPERS CLOSING THE END WITH A WOODEN TOOTHPICK
EGGS WITH WINE PUT THREE CUPFULS OF RED WINE INTO A CASSEROLE AND ADD THREE TABLESPOONFULS OF SUGAR RIND OF HALF A LEMON RAISINS AND SWEET ALMONDS BLANCHED AND CHOPPED
STIR THE MIXTURE FOR ONE AND ONE-HALF MINUTES
HAUT SAUTERNE
BUT IF YOU INVESTIGATE A LITTLE DEEPER YOU WILL LEARN THAT THESE HAMS WERE NOT PUT UP IN ITALY AT ALL BUT THAT IT IS A SPECIAL BRAND THAT IS PREPARED IN VIRGINIA FOR THE ITALIANS
IN A HOT FRYING PAN PLACE THE BIRDS IN THE GREASE THAT COMES AROUND THEM AND HEAT THEM THROUGH
WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR US TO DEPART THE ENTIRE SEVEN ROSE AND STOOD BOWING AS WE PASSED FROM THE RESTAURANT
BOTH ARE INSTITUTIONS OF THE PLACE AND ONE IS PRONE TO WONDER HOW A CAT CAN HAVE SO MUCH PATIENCE WITH A LITTLE BOY
HE SERVED NO ORDINARY LIQUOR OF ANY SORT SAYING THAT IF ANYBODY WANTED WHISKEY THEY COULD GET IT AT ANY SALOON
LAMB CHOPS MARINADE SOAK KIDNEY LAMB CHOPS IN THE FOLLOWING MIXTURE FOR TWELVE HOURS AND THEN BROIL
DIP IN BREAD CRUMBS AND FRY IN BUTTER UNTIL A LIGHT BROWN
BOIL CORN MEAL UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY DONE AND THEN COOL IT UNTIL IT CAN BE CUT IN SLICES FOR FRYING
THE RECIPE FOR THIS AS PREPARED BY THE IRON HOUSE IS STILL EXTANT AND WE ARE INDEBTED TO A LADY WHO WAS A LITTLE GIRL WHEN THAT RESTAURANT WAS WANING WHOSE MOTHER SECURED THE RECIPE
THE POODLE DOG HAS A HOTEL ATTACHMENT WHERE ONE MAY GET ROOMS OR FULL APARTMENTS
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOFT SPOT IN OUR HEARTS FOR THE HOTEL ST FRANCIS AND IT IS HERE THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS FELT A MOST PLEASURABLE EMOTION WHEN SEEKING A PLACE WHERE GOOD THINGS ARE SERVED
VIRGINIA EGG NOG BEAT SEPARATELY THE YOLKS AND WHITES OF TEN EGGS THE YOLKS TO A SOFT CREAM
PLACE THESE IN A PAN CONTAINING HOT OLIVE OIL AND SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER
THAT IS BUT A FEW OF THEM
WE ASKED JULES DAUVILLER THE PRESENT CHEF OF THE PALACE FOR THE RECIPE OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED THE BEST DISH NOW PREPARED AT THE PALACE AND HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE US TWO AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHICH WAS THE BEST AND MOST DISTINCTIVE
WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR ORDER A MESSENGER IS DISPATCHED TO THE MARKET AND USUALLY HE BRINGS THE FISH ALIVE AND THE CHEF PREPARES IT IN ONE OF HIS MANY WAYS FOR HE IS SAID TO HAVE MORE SECRETS ABOUT THE COOKING OF FISH THAN ONE WOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR ONE BRAIN TO CONTAIN
MAKE A LITTLE BROTH WITH VEAL BONE A SMALL PIECE OF BEEF A PIG'S FOOT NECK FEET AND GIZZARD OF CHICKEN
SALAMI AND ANCHOVIES
HE OPENED THE PLACE UNDER THE FLOOD BUILDING AFTER THE FIRE IN MOST MAGNIFICENT STYLE TAKING IN TWO PARTNERS
FOOTE AND OTHER PROMINENT SOUTHERNERS
IF TOO STIFF TO DROP FROM A SPOON ADD THE STRAINED LIQUOR OF CLAMS
THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO NEED A LITTLE ADVICE ON HOW TO GET THE BEST OUT OF LIFE AND WE ARE GOING TO WHISPER A FEW WORDS TO ALL SUCH AS THESE WE HAVE MENTIONED
THERE ARE DRIED VEGETABLES AND DRIED FRUITS SUCH AS WERE NEVER DREAMED OF IN YOUR LIMITED EXPERIENCE AND EVEN THE GROCER HIMSELF THE SMILING AND COSMOPOLITAN VERGA CONFESSES THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL OF THEM
TURN THE CORNER AND WALK ALONG GRANT AVENUE TOWARD THE HILL
WHEN READY TURN INTO THIS THE BEATEN EGGS AND COOK UNTIL DONE
1882 1890 1898 AND 1900
NEITHER COULD THEY APPROACH THE ROMANCE THAT ALWAYS SURROUNDED THE O'FARRELL STREET RESTAURANT
THESE ARE USUALLY SERVED BORDELAISE AND MAKE QUITE A PLEASANT CHANGE WHEN ONE IS SURFEITED WITH OTHER SHELL FISH BUT THE BEST RECIPE IS
WHILE THE SPANISH DID NOT IMPRESS THEIR COOKING ON SAN FRANCISCO IT IS THE CUISINE OF THE LATIN RACES THAT HAS GIVEN TO IT ITS GREATEST GASTRONOMIC PRESTIGE AND THERE STILL REMAINS FROM THOSE VERY EARLY DAYS RECIPES OF THE FAMOUS DISHES WHICH HAD THEIR BEGINNINGS EITHER IN SPAIN OR MEXICO
FROM THIS WE COME TO THE ORDERED DINNER AND HERE IS WHERE YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIAL DESIRES COME IN
LOVERS OF THE NIGHT LIFE KNOW IT WELL FOR IT IS THE DESTINATION OF MANY AN AUTOMOBILE PARTY
NOW ABOUT THIS WHISPER
TO SOME PLEASANT COMPANION
PETER JOB SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY AND OPENED A RESTAURANT WHERE SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO LADY PATRONS AND SHORTLY AFTER THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT IN KEARNY STREET DID THE SAME
POLENTI PROPERLY PREPARED IS A DISH THAT REQUIRES MUCH LABOR AND SCARCELY REPAYS FOR THE TIME AND EXERTION SPENT IN ITS MAKING
THE UNREFINED GET EVERYWHERE EVEN INTO THE DRAWING ROOMS OF ROYALTY CONSEQUENTLY WE MUST EXPECT TO MEET THEM IN BOHEMIA
BAKE IN A HOT OVEN TEN MINUTES AND POUR OVER ZABAIONE AND SERVE
WE NEED BUT SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS QUESTION FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS YET EVEN NOW WE MEET WITH SURPRISES IN THE WAY OF NEW DELICACIES AND MODES OF USING HERBS AND SPICES IN FOOD PREPARATION
SOFT AND MILD
I DO SO LOVE TO ASSOCIATE WITH REAL BOHEMIANS LIKE THESE
JUST BEFORE YOU TURN OFF BROADWAY INTO GRANT AVENUE AFTER PASSING THE FIOR D'ITALIA THE BUON GUSTO THE DANTE AND IL TROVATORE RESTAURANTS WE COME TO A MOST INTERESTING WINDOW WHERE IS DISPLAYED SUCH A VARIETY OF SAUSAGES AS TO MAKE ONE WONDER AT THE INVENTIVE GENIUS WHO THOUGHT OF THEM ALL
IF YOU DESIRE IT AT COPPA'S ON YOUR VISIT TO SAN FRANCISCO YOU WILL HAVE TO TELEPHONE OUT TO HIM IN ADVANCE UNLESS HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING BACK TO THE CITY WHICH HE CONTEMPLATES SO THAT HE CAN PREPARE IT FOR YOU AND TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT YOU WILL NEVER REGRET DOING SO
COUNT THE DIFFERENT KINDS
IN A SEPARATE KETTLE COOK IN HOT OIL ONE SLICED ONION ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC A LITTLE PARSLEY ONE BELL PEPPER ONE TOMATO A SMALL PIECE OF CELERY AND A CARROT
AROUND AND OVER THESE PLAYED BEARS MONKEYS PARROTS CATS AND DOGS AND WHATEVER SORT OF BIRD OR ANIMAL THAT COULD BE ACCOMMODATED UNTIL IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL MENAGERIE
INTO THIS PUT TWO DOZEN LARGE OYSTERS AND LET COOK UNTIL EDGES CURL UP AND SERVE HOT
EARLY ITALIAN IMPRESSION ALMOST COINCIDENT WITH THE OPENING OF THE IRON HOUSE AN ITALIAN NAMED BAZZURO TOOK POSSESSION OF ONE OF THE STRANDED SAILING VESSELS ENCUMBERING THE BAY AND ANCHORED IT OUT IN THE WATER AT THE POINT WHERE DAVIS AND PACIFIC STREETS NOW INTERSECT
IN THE GENUINE TAMALE THE INTERIOR IS THE SAUCE AND MEAT THAT GOES WITH THE CORN MEAL WHICH IS ALTERNATELY LAID WITH THE HUSKS AND WHEN MADE THE ENDS ARE TIED WITH FINE HUSK
HERE EXTENDING NORTH FROM JACKSON STREET TO THE BAY ARE CONGREGATED ITALIANS FRENCH PORTUGUESE AND MEXICANS EACH IN A DISTINCT COLONY AND EACH MAINTAINING THE LIFE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND IN SOME INSTANCES THE COSTUMES OF THE PARENT COUNTRIES AS FULLY AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR NATIVE LANDS
VINTAGE YEARS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF WINES
AN ITALIAN GIRL SAID TO US ONE DAY
ALMOST ALL OF THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS WILL GIVE YOU CRAB IN MANY FORMS AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD
BOIL SIX LARGE CHILI PEPPERS IN A LITTLE WATER UNTIL COOKED SO THEY CAN BE STRAINED THROUGH A FINE STRAINER AND ADD TO THIS THE CHOPPED CHICKEN WITH SALT TO TASTE AND A LITTLE CHOPPED PARSLEY
ADD HALF A CUP OF COLD WATER COVER TIGHTLY AND LET STAND SEVERAL HOURS
SQUAB WITH LETTUCE
THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE CALL OF THE WIND AND OF THE SEA AND OF THE AIR IS THE INSPIRATION THAT MAKES SAN FRANCISCO THE PLEASURE-GROUND OF THE WORLD
IT IS MACARONI TIPS AND TIPPING TIPPING IS VARIOUSLY DESIGNATED
BEAT THE BUTTER AND FLOUR TOGETHER UNTIL SMOOTH AND WHITE
SPRINKLE WITH CHOPPED PARSLEY AND SERVE WITH SQUARES OF TOAST OR CRACKERS
TO THE TAGLIARINI ADD A HANDFUL OF MUSHROOMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SLICED AND FRIED IN BUTTER
HENCE COMES THE BOHEMIANISM BORN OF INDIVIDUALITY AND INDEPENDENCE
WHEN THE WINE BOILS BREAK THE EGGS INTO IT AS IN POACHING EGGS
A BREAKFAST IN THE LADIES GRILL WITH AN OMELET OF CALIFORNIA OYSTERS TOAST AND COFFEE WAS A MEAL LONG TO BE REMEMBERED
ONE OF US MADE AN OMELET OF THE FIVE EGGS THE ONION AND THE GREEN PEPPER WITH CRUMBS OF BREAD AND THIS IS THE RECIPE
AFTER THE FIRE ONE OF THE EARLIEST RESTAURANTS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THAT PART OF THE CITY WAS BAZZURO'S AT THE SAME CORNER AND IT IS STILL RUN BY THE FAMILY WHO TOOK CHARGE AFTER THE DEATH OF THE ORIGINAL PROPRIETOR
HIS RECIPE IS LONG AND ITS PREPARATION REQUIRES MUCH PATIENCE BUT THE RESULT IS SUCH A GASTRONOMIC MARVEL THAT ONE NEVER REGRETS THE TIME SPENT IN ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT
BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC--MUSIC THAT HAS MELODY AND RHYTHM AND SOOTHING CADENCES GO TO THE HEIDELBERG INN AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING
SAN FRANCISCO'S COSMOPOLITANISM IS PECULIAR TO ITSELF
HE SHOWED THIS ONE EVENING WHEN HE HAD FILLED A LITTLE PARTY OF US TO REPLETION BY HIS LAVISH PROVISION FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND NATURE REBELLED AGAINST ANYTHING MORE
THIS MUST BE SERVED VERY COLD AND YOU MAY SERVE MAYONNAISE SAUCE ON THE SIDE
UNDER OUR NEW CONDITIONS THESE ALWAYS APPEAR ON THE BILL WHEN ORDERED AND IF THEY BE NOT ORDERED THEY DO NOT APPEAR FOR THEY NOW ARE MADE TO INCREASE THE INCOME
AMONTILLADO MONTILO AND OLOROSA SHERRIES
TAMALES BOIL ONE CHICKEN UNTIL THE MEAT COMES FROM THE BONES
ON THE OIL POUR SUFFICIENT WATER TO COVER THE MEAT AND ADD THE ONIONS AND PEPPERS LETTING ALL SIMMER FOR A FEW MINUTES
IT WAS BUILT OF HEAVY SHEET IRON THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT AROUND THE HORN IN A SAILING VESSEL AND CATERED WELL BECOMING FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE MOST FAMED RESTAURANT OF THE CITY
THE PLACE IS STILL IN EXISTENCE AND GOOD SERVICE AND GOOD FOOD IS TO BE HAD THERE BUT IT HAS LOST ITS BOHEMIAN ATMOSPHERE
WHEN THE STEAK IS COOKED SUFFICIENTLY PUT IT TO ONE SIDE OF THE PAN AND LET THE OIL RUN TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER GOOD THINGS TO ORDER IF YOU LIKE BUT WE HAVE DISCOVERED NOTHING THAT MAKES SO COMPLETE A BREAKFAST AS THIS
SELECT A TABLE NEXT TO ONE OF THE WESTERN WINDOWS AND ORDER A BREAKFAST THAT IS SERVED HERE BETTER THAN ANY PLACE WE HAVE TRIED
HAVE A PAN OF BOILING LARD READY AND AFTER DIPPING THE STUFFED PEPPER INTO THE BATTER DIP IT INTO THE LARD
ABOVE ALL YOU WILL FIND A JOY OF INVENTION AND WILL BE SURPRISED AT THE DELECTABLE DISHES YOU CAN PREPARE AT A MINIMUM OF COST
MUCH COULD BE WRITTEN OF THESE OLD-TIME RESTAURANTS AND AS WE WRITE STORY AFTER STORY AMUSING INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE COME TO MIND EACH INDICATIVE OF THE PERIOD WHEN TRUE BOHEMIANISM WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CITY THAT WAS
SLICE AND FRY BROWN TWO LARGE ONIONS AND ADD TWO HEAPING QUARTS OF SLICED OKRA AND ONE CUT UP POD OF RED PEPPER
UNDER THE ST ANN BUILDING AT EDDY AND POWELL STREETS WAS THE LOUVRE STARTED AND MANAGED BY CARL ZINKAND WHO AFTERWARD OPENED THE PLACE IN MARKET ABOVE FOURTH STREET CALLED ZINKAND'S
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO THE FEW THINGS IN YOUR LIMITED EXPERIENCE
THE CALIFORNIA OYSTER PROPER IS VERY SMALL AND IT HAS A PECULIAR COPPERY TASTE WHICH BON VIVANTS DECLARE ADDS TO ITS PIQUANCY
FOUR KINDS OF PASTE
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR MORE THAN A WEEK YOU WILL FIND THAT A LITTLE APARTMENT FURNISHED READY FOR HOUSEKEEPING WILL GIVE YOU OPPORTUNITY TO BE INDEPENDENT AND FREE
THE EARLIER BOATS WERE MOORED AND ON THE DECKS FIRES WERE BURNING IN CHARCOAL BRAZIERS ON WHICH THE FISHERMEN COOKED THEIR BREAKFASTS OF FISH AND COFFEE WITH THE HEAVY BLACK LOAVES OF BREAD FOR WHICH THEY SEEM TO HAVE SPECIAL FANCY
FOR INSTANCE ONE WOULD NOT ASK FOR SAUER BRATEN ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT A GERMAN RESTAURANT
EVIDENTLY THE RECIPE FOR WHAT IS CONSIDERED BEST IN BOTH OF THE SOLARI RESTAURANTS CAME FROM COMMON OWNERSHIP FOR EACH OF THESE PLACES GAVE IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR ITS BEST RECIPE THE FOLLOWING
WE HAD SAND-DABS MUNIER CHATEAUBRIAND WITH MUSHROOMS ITALIAN SQUASH FRIED IN OIL WITH A FLAVOR OF GARLIC FRENCH PASTRY AND COFFEE TOGETHER WITH SOME GOOD CALIFORNIA TIPO CHIANTI ALL FLAVORED WITH SUCH A STREAM OF REMINISCENCE THAT WE FORGOT THAT SUCH THINGS AS CLOCKS EXISTED
COPPA'S WALLS WERE ALWAYS ADORNED WITH STRANGE CONCEITS OF THE ARTISTS AND WRITERS WHO FREQUENTED HIS PLACE AND AFTER A PICTURE OR A BIT OF VERSE HAD REMAINED UNTIL IT WAS TOO FAMILIAR SOME ONE ERASED IT AND REPLACED IT WITH SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS BETTER
EVEN FANCY DISHES SUCH AS OYSTERS KIRKPATRICK WOULD BE BETTER IF MADE OF THE EASTERN OYSTER NOT WHAT THEY CALL THE EASTERN OYSTER HERE FOR THAT IS A MISNOMER BUT THE OYSTERS THAT GROW IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
HERE YOU FIND THE DELICACIES AND THE NICETIES OF ITALIAN LIVING
JULE'S IS FAMOUS FOR HIS REX SOLE
WHEN THE EGGS BEGIN TO STIFFEN POUR THE OYSTERS OVER AND TURN THE OMELET TOGETHER
OF ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS THEY HAVE EVER SEEN AND IT IS ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF THEIR LIMITED EXPERIENCE
TO ME THE SYSTEM HAS NEVER BEEN AN ANNOYANCE BUT A DELIGHTFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF TACT AND JUDGMENT WE LOOK UPON TIPPING AS A PART OF EXPENSE TO BE CALCULATED UPON NECESSARY TO INSURE GOOD SERVICE NOT ONLY NOW BUT IN THE FUTURE AND IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE COMPUTED IN THE EXPENSE OF A TRIP OR A DINNER
AT THE HOTEL ST FRANCIS ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 18 1906 ONE OF US STOOD IN THE DOORWAY OF THE HOTEL ST FRANCIS AND WATCHED APPROACHING FIRES THAT CAME FROM THREE DIRECTIONS
THE WISE ONES LOOK AT IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
IT IS SAID THAT THE STYLE NOW CALLED OYSTERS KIRKPATRICK IS BUT A VARIANT OF MANNING'S OYSTER SALT ROAST AT THE CORNER OF CALIFORNIA AND SANSOME STREETS WHERE NOW STANDS THE BANK OF CALIFORNIA WAS THE TEHAMA HOUSE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE CITY'S EARLY HOSTELRIES WHOSE RESTAURANT WAS FAMED FOR ITS EXCELLENCE
FLAVOR WITH VANILLA AND POUR WHILE HOT OVER EACH SERVICE OF THE ROLL
IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS CONSIDERED A FEAT OF GORMANDIZING TO GO THROUGH ONE OF COPPA'S DINNERS AND EAT EVERYTHING SET BEFORE YOU FOR ONE DOLLAR
WHILE THESE THREE RESTAURANTS ARE OF SIMILAR TYPE NEITHER HAS THE PRE-FIRE ATMOSPHERE
IT WAS MORE THAN A TRIBUTE TO THE DAYS OF OLD--IT MARKED THE PASSING OF THE OLD SAN FRANCISCO AND THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW
THE HOF BRAU RESTAURANT IS NOW MAKING A SPECIALTY OF ABALONE'S BUT IT TAKES SENTIMENT TO SAY THAT ONE REALLY FINDS ANYTHING EXTRA GOOD IN THEM
SINCE THE FIRST CLIFF HOUSE WAS ERECTED THIS HAS BEEN A PLACE FAMOUS THE WORLD OVER BECAUSE OF ITS SCENIC BEAUTY AND ITS OVERLOOKING THE SEAL ROCKS WHERE CONGREGATE A LARGE HERD OF SEA LIONS DISPORTING MUCH TO THE EDIFICATION OF THE VISITORS
HIS PRICES ARE MODERATE AND HIS COOKING AND VIANDS OF THE BEST AND WILL SATISFY THE MOST CRITICAL OF THE GOURMETS
IT IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED THAT BOTH OF THESE ARE THE PRODUCT OF MEXICO BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE
PUT A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER IN A FRYING PAN AND INTO THIS PUT THE ONION AND MARROW AND FRY TO A DELICATE BROWN
A BARE RECITAL OF THE TERMS OF THE RECIPE CANNOT BRING TO THE UNINITIATED EVEN A SUSPICION OF THE DELIGHTFUL AROMA THAT COMES FROM THE COCOANUT WHEN ITS TOP IS LIFTED NOR CAN IT GIVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF THE DELICACY OF THE SAVOR ARISING FROM THE COMBINATION OF THE COCOANUT WITH YOUNG CHICKEN
THIS WILL MAKE A MOST DELICIOUS DESSERT DISH
OVER NORTH BEACH WAY WE ASKED THE CHEF OF A LITTLE RESTAURANT HOW HE COOKED CRAB
THIS IS TO BE SERVED WITH CHICKEN OR VEAL
AND IF SUCH DREAMS BEGUILE
BEAT WELL TWO EGGS AND ADD TO THEM HALF A GILL EACH OF CREAM AND VINEGAR HALF TEASPOONFUL MUSTARD CELERY SEED SALT EACH ONE-TENTH TEASPOONFUL CAYENNE AND A TABLESPOONFUL OF BUTTER
DURING ALL THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE THE ONLY DAY IT WAS CLOSED WAS THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL OF SULLIVAN'S MOTHER
THESE TUGS BRING IN THE CATCHES OF DOZENS OF SMALLER BOATS MANNED BY FISHERMEN WHO ARE TOILING OUT BEYOND THE HEADS AND UP THE TWO GREAT RIVERS
A GOOD VARIETY WITH PLEASING FLAVOR AND AROMA
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE HOW YOU WERE DRESSED NOR HOW DIGNIFIED YOU TRIED TO BE IT WAS ALL ONE WITH THE CROWD AROUND THE TABLES
SAKI IS THE JAPANESE WINE MADE OF RICE AND IS TAKEN IN LIBERAL QUANTITIES

IT DEPENDS SO LITTLE ON ENVIRONMENT THAT IT MEANS NOTHING AND SO MUCH ON COMPANIONSHIP THAT IT MEANS ALL
THEY LIVE TWICE AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY AT HALF THE COST
TO SPEAK OF SEEING BARBARY COAST BROUGHT FURTIVE LOOKS AND LOWERED VOICES AS IF CONTAMINATION EVEN FROM THE THOUGHT WERE POSSIBLE
THERE IS NOW A RESTAURANT IN GEARY STREET NEAR MASON WHICH HAS ON ITS WINDOWS IN VERY SMALL LETTERS MICHAEL FORMERLY OF AND THEN IN BOLD LETTERING MARCHANDS BUT MICHAEL HAS NEITHER THE ART NOR THE VIANDS THAT MADE MARCHANDS FAMOUS AND HE IS CONTENT TO SAY THAT HIS MOST FAMOUS DISH IS TRIPE--JUST PLAIN PLEBEIAN TRIPE
SANG THE SWAN SONG IN THE LATTER PART OF APRIL 1906 WHEN THE FIRE-SWEPT STREETS PRESENTED THEIR MOST FORBIDDING ASPECT AND WHEN THE ONLY MOVING FIGURES TO BE SEEN AFTER NIGHTFALL WERE ARMED SOLDIERS GUARDING THE LITTLE REMAINING OF VALUE FROM DEPREDATIONS OF SKULKING VAGABONDS A NUMBER OF THE OLD BOHEMIAN SPIRITS GATHERED AT THE CORNER OF MONTGOMERY AND COMMERCIAL STREETS AND GAZED THROUGH THE SHATTERED WINDOWS INTO THE OLD DINING ROOM WHERE THEY HAD HELD MANY A ROYAL FEAST
BUT FOR A MOST PLEASANT VISIT TO THE CLIFF HOUSE ONE SHOULD CHOOSE THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AND GO OUT WHEN THE AIR IS BLOWING FREE AND FRESH FROM THE SEA THE WAVES CRESTING WITH AMBER UNDER THE MAGIC TOUCH OF THE EASTERLY SUN
EVERYTHING HE SAY FRY IT IN ANOTHER VEGETABLE STAND WE FOUND AN ITALIAN GIRL WHOSE SOFT LISPING ACCENT PRONOUNCED HER A GENOESE AND SHE DIFFIDENTLY SUGGESTED A FINE ITALIAN DESSERT A FINE DESERT YOU TAKE MACAROONS AND STRAWBERRIES
WITH THE BONE OF THE SAND-DAB WELL CLEANED MAKE A STOCK WITH ONE BOTTLE OF RIESLING JUICE OF ONE LEMON AND SEASONING
RICH AND GOOD
A LITTLE SHOP BARELY LARGE ENOUGH TO TURN AROUND IN BETWEEN COUNTER AND WALL MAY HAVE ENOUGH OF INTEREST TO ENTERTAIN YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HERE THE PRICES WILL BE REMARKABLY LOW FOR THESE PEOPLE HAVE SO LITTLE OF THE OUTSIDE TRADE THAT THEY HAVE NOT LEARNED TO ADD TO THEIR PRICES WHEN THEY SEE AN AMERICAN FACE COMING
WE MUST SAY THAT THE FINEST FISH WE HAVE EATEN IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS NOT IN THE HIGH-PRICED RESTAURANTS AT ALL BUT IN A LITTLE DINGY BACK ROOM DOWN AT FISHERMEN'S WHARF WHERE THERE WAS SAND ON THE FLOOR AND ALL THE SOUNDS OF THE KITCHEN WERE AUDIBLE IN THE DINING ROOM
HAS BEAUTIFUL COLOR AND DELICATE FLAVOR
COOK THE PEELED MUSHROOMS IN THE REMAINING SAUCE BEFORE THE LAST THICKENING AND SERVE IN GRAVY BOAT TO POUR OVER THE CHICKEN
THE NEXT COURSE WAS A MIXTURE OF IMMATURE VEGETABLES SERVED IN A SORT OF SAUTE

HIS RECIPE FOR THIS WAS AS FOLLOWS
WHEN IN DOUBT ORDER A TABLE D'HOTE DINNER
DELMONICO RAISIN SAUCE BROWN BUTTER IN A SKILLET AND STIR IN A TEASPOONFUL OF FLOUR FORMING A SMOOTH PASTE
CARCIOFFI ALL'INFERNO
HERE TOO COMES A MARKED INCREASE IN THE COST
YOU WILL BE LET INTO FAMILY SECRETS OF THE ALIEN QUARTERS AND WILL LEARN OF HOPES ASPIRATIONS AND DESIRES THAT WILL STARTLE YOU WITH THEIR STRANGENESS
THE TAMALE HAD ITS ORIGIN IN SPAIN AND WAS CARRIED TO MEXICO BY THE CONQUISTADORS AND TAKEN UP AS A NATIONAL DISH BY THE NATIVES AFTER MANY YEARS
LACRIMA CHRISTI SPUMANTI

A GOOD BOHEMIAN DINNER SOMETIMES PEOPLE DESIRE TO GIVE A DINNER AND ARE AT LOSS AS TO THE PROPER TIME TO SERVE WINES
FROM OUR STORE WE HAVE SELECTED THE FOLLOWING AS BEING WELL WORTH TRYING
NAMES OF SOME OF THEM ARE ACCIDENTS AS IS ILLUSTRATED BY MACARONI
CHICKEN A LA LEON D'ORO CUT A SPRING CHICKEN INTO PIECES
PLACE THE FRIED CORN MEAL IN A PLATTER IN LAYERS SPRINKLING EACH WITH GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE SALT AND PEPPER
BUT THAT DOES NOT BOTHER HER IN THE LEAST FOR SHE CAN MAKE SIGNS AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THEM EVEN BETTER THAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE ENGLISH OF HER HUSBAND
PUT THE PIECES IN A SAUTE PAN WITH TWO OUNCES OF SWEET BUTTER SALT PEPPER A VERY LITTLE CELERY SALT A PINCH OF PAPRIKA
WITH THESE CAME BOWLS OF SOUP SERVED IN LACQUER WARE MADE OF GLUTINOUS NESTS OF SWALLOWS AND ALSO A SALAD MADE OF SHARK FINS
SOME FOOD VARIANTS VARIANTS OF FOOD PREPARATION SOMETIMES TYPIFY NATIONALITIES BETTER EVEN THAN VARIANTS OF LANGUAGE OR CLOTHING
PACIFIC COAST OYSTERS FAIL IN SIZE FLAVOR AND COOKING WHEN COMPARED WITH THE LUSCIOUS BIVALVE OF THE ATLANTIC SO FAR AS THE ORDINARY FORMS OF PREPARATION IS CONCERNED
LAY THEM FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO MARINADE IN A GLASS OF WHITE WINE WITH SWEET HERBS
THERE IS MUCH MISCONCEPTION REGARDING BOTH SPANISH AND MEXICAN COOKING FOR IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS A FACT THAT ALL MEXICAN AND SPANISH DISHES ARE SO FILLED WITH RED PEPPER AS TO BE UNPALATABLE TO THE NORMAL STOMACH OF THOSE TRAINED TO WHAT IS CALLED PLAIN AMERICAN COOKING CERTAIN DISHES OF MEXICAN AND SPANISH ORIGIN OWE THEIR FINE FLAVOR TO DISCRIMINATING USE OF CHILI CALIENTE OR CHILI DULCE BUT MANY OF THE BEST DISHES ARE ENTIRELY INNOCENT OF EITHER
FRY IT THEN HIS PARTNER SHOUTED HIS LAUGHTER AND DERISION
DEMI TASSE
DEMI TASSE
BUT WAIT A MINUTE
UP IN THE SECOND STORY ON A LARGE BUILDING YOU MAY SEE A SIGN THAT TELLS YOU MEALS WILL BE SERVED AND ROOMS PROVIDED
AROUND THE CORNER LIES ITALY AND FROM ITALY YOU PASS TO LOMBARDY AND ON TO GREECE
HERE ONE HAD TO DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON SENTIMENT OR RATHER SENTIMENTALITY TO BE PLEASED
ALL BECAUSE YOU DARE TO BREAK AWAY FROM CONVENTIONALITIES WHICH MAKE SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECT IGNORANCE OF HOW TO LIVE BECAUSE THEY IMAGINE IT IS AN EVIDENCE OF REFINEMENT
SPANISH DINNERS OF GOOD QUALITY ARE TO BE HAD AT THE MADRILENA AT 177 EDDY STREET AND AT THE CASTILIAN AT 344 SUTTER STREET
CHATEAU YQUEM
QUAJATALE EN MOLE THIS IS MEXICAN TURKEY IN RED PEPPER A FAVORITE BANQUET DISH
IT SO HAPPENED THAT THERE WERE TWO BROTHERS AND AS SOMETIMES OCCURS BROTHERS DISAGREED WITH THE RESULT THAT FRED SOLARI WITHDREW AND OPENED A RESTAURANT AT GEARY AND MASON JUST A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE ORIGINAL PLACE
IN THE NEW BUON GUSTO RESTAURANT IN BROADWAY THEY COOK POLENTI TO PERFECTION AND WHEN IT IS SERVED WITH CIPPINO IT LEAVES NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
CHEESE
TAKE PARSLEY AND ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC CHOPPED FINE AND A CAN OF FRENCH MUSHROOMS CUT IN QUARTERS AND FRY IN BUTTER THEN ADD ENOUGH GRAVY TO POUR OVER THE FRIED CORN MEAL
THE PROPER PRONUNCIATION OF THIS IS AS IF IT WERE SPELLED ZHAN-DU-YA
A WHITE SAUTERNE OF EXQUISITE BOUQUET
QUEER FISH PICKLED AND DRIED
SHE WAS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE AS MA TANTA MY AUNT HER COOKING WAS CONSIDERED THE BEST OF ALL IN THE CITY AND HER PATRONS SAT AT A LONG COMMON TABLE NEAT AND CLEAN TO THE LAST DEGREE
E CHICKENS AND TURKEYS AND TO BEEF VEAL PORK AND MUTTON
IF ONE INVESTIGATE CLOSELY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS PART OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS AND STILL UNDERSTAND NO OTHER LANGUAGE THAN THAT OF THEIR NATIVE HOME
STRAIN THE SAUCE AND THICKEN WITH FLOUR UNTIL IT IS OF THE CONSISTENCY OF A RATHER THIN BATTER
HERE YOU DO NOT FIND OBTRUSIVE WAITERS BRUSHING IMAGINARY CRUMBS FROM YOUR CHAIR WITH OBSEQUIOUS HAND NOR OVER ZEALOUS STEWARDS SOLICITOUS OF YOUR FOOD'S QUALITY
THERE IS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS MOST PLEASING AFTER HAVING EXPERIENCED THOSE OTHER RESTAURANTS WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE THE BUSINESS OF ALL THE REST OF THE GUESTS TO KNOW JUST WHAT YOU ARE EATING AND DRINKING
WITH THEM ALSO CAME COOKS TO PREPARE DELECTABLE DISHES FOR THOSE WHO HAD PASSED THE FLAP-JACK STAGE AND DESIRED THE GOOD THINGS OF LIFE TO REPAY THEM FOR THE HARDSHIPS PRIVATIONS AND DEARTH OF WOMAN'S COMPANIONSHIP
IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD-WIDE FAME
SPEECH MANNERS CUSTOMS COSTUMES AND RELIGIONS CHANGE WITH STARTLING RAPIDITY AND AS YOU ENTER INTO THE LIFE OF THE NATION YOU FIND THAT EACH HAS BROUGHT THE BEST OF ITS GASTRONOMY FOR YOUR DELECTATION
THERE IS NO IRKSOME ESPIONAGE ON THE PART OF OTHER PATRONS ALL OF WHOM ARE THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING STRICTLY TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND THE AFFAIRS OF OTHER DINERS ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO THEM
THEN WE HAVE TURTLE BROUGHT FROM CHINA DIFFERENT FROM THE TURTLE THEY HAVE HERE AND WE COOK IT CHINA STYLE
SOME OF THESE ARE FROM CHEFS IN RESTAURANTS AND HOTELS SOME FROM MEN AND WOMEN OF THE FOREIGN COLONIES AND SOME FROM GOOD FRIENDS WHO LENT THEIR AID IN OUR PLEASURABLE OCCUPATION
RAVIOLI A LA GENOESE AND SPAGHETTI WITH MUSHROOMS
ROOSTING ON PILES AND LINING THE WATER'S EDGE ON EVERYTHING THAT SERVED TO GIVE FOOTHOLD WERE COUNTLESS SEAGULLS ALL WAITING FOR THE BREAKFAST THEY KNEW WAS COMING FROM THE DISCARDED FISH AND FIT COMPANIONS WERE THE WOMEN WITH SHAWLS OVER THEIR HEADS IRREVERENTLY CALLED MUD HENS AND OLD MEN IN DILAPIDATED CLOTHING WHO SAT ALONG THE STRINGERS OF THE WHARF SOME WITH BASKETS SOME WITH BUCKETS AND OTHERS WITH LITTLE PAPER BAGS IN WHICH TO PUT THE FISH WHICH THEY COULD GET SO CHEAPLY IT MEANT A MEAL FOR THEM WHEN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT
YOU WILL ALWAYS GET A GOOD MEAL FOR THE LEAST OUT LAY OF MONEY AND LEAST EXPENDITURE OF THOUGHT
ITALIAN SALAD SOAK TWO SALT HERRINGS IN MILK OVER NIGHT AND THEN REMOVE THE BONES AND SKIN AND CUT UP IN SMALL PIECES
BUT MANY OF THE HARDY PIONEERS WERE OF ENGLISH AND AMERICAN STOCK AND PREFERRED THE PLAINER FOODS OF THEIR OLD HOMES TO THE HIGHLY SEASONED DISHES OF THE LATIN CHEFS AND TO CATER TO THIS GROWING DEMAND THE NEVADA WAS OPENED IN PINE STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY

NOW AS BEFORE THE FIRE WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESTAURANT CITY OF THE WORLD--A CITY WHERE HOME LIFE IS SUBORDINATED TO THE CONVENIENCE OF APARTMENT DWELLING AND RESTAURANT MEALS-BUT THE OLD-TIME BOHEMIAN FINDS NEITHER THE SAME ATMOSPHERE NOR THE SAME RESTAURANTS
ALL WERE COARSE LOUD AND MUCH IN EVIDENCE
COVER TIGHTLY AND LET COOK GENTLY FOR HALF AN HOUR
ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED AUTHORITY THE FINEST FISH THAT SWIMS IS THE SAND-DAB SOME GOURMETS HOWEVER WILL TAKE ISSUE WITH HIM ON THIS AND SAY THE POMPANO IS BETTER
CUT A BEEF MARROW INTO SMALL DICE AND STIR IT WITH THE CHOPPED ONION
AS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT DISH IT CAN WELL BE MADE TO SERVE AS A FULL MEAL ESPECIALLY WHEN TAGLIARINI IS PREPARED AFTER THE FOLLOWING RECIPE
VISITORS HAVE OFTEN EXPRESSED WONDER AT THE VARIETY OF FOODS AND DELICATE FLAVORS IN SAN FRANCISCO RESTAURANTS AND POSSIBLY THIS BRIEF EXPLANATION MAY GIVE SOME COMPREHENSION OF WHY SAN FRANCISCANS ALWAYS WANT TO GET BACK TO WHERE THEY CAN GET SOMETHING TO EAT TOLD IN A WHISPER SURELY THE OLD BOHEMIANS OF SAN FRANCISCO DID NOT SPEND ALL THEIR TIME IN RESTAURANTS
WHEN DONE STRAIN THEM AND DRAIN THE CHICKEN
THOSE WHO MADE THE CITY THE HOME OF BOHEMIA--AND IT IS WITH THIS FEELING THAT WE NOW COME TO DISCUSS THE BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF THE NEW SAN FRANCISCO
WHAT VULGARITIES ARE PERPETRATED IN THY NAME
A HEAVIER WINE WITH GOOD BOUQUET AND FINE FLAVOR
BEAT THE YOLKS AND WHITES OF SIX EGGS SEPARATELY THEN MIX AND STIR IN A LITTLE FLOUR TO MAKE A THIN BATTER
PLANKED FILLET MIGNON TRIM SOME SELECT FILLET MIGNON OF BEEF ABOUT FOUR OUNCES OF EACH NICELY
ALL THE HASTE WE MADE WAS ON THE STREETS AND WHEN WE FINISHED OUR COURSE AT THE FIOR D'ITALIA WE WHIRLED AWAY OVER TOWARD NORTH BEACH TO THE GIANDUJA WHERE HAD BEEN PREPARED ESPECIALLY FOR US TAGLIARINI WITH CHICKEN LIVERS AND MUSHROOMS AND BECAUSE OF ITS SUCCESS WE HAD A BOTTLE OF LACRIMA CHRISTI SPUMANTI THE ENJOYMENT OF WHICH DELAYED US
THE OLD TIMER HOWEVER CRACKED THE SHRIMP'S NECK PINCHED ITS TAIL AND OUT POPPED A DELICIOUS BONNE BOUCHE WHICH ADDED TO THE JOY OF THE MEAL AND INCREASED THE APPETITE
SOME OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE MEALS WE HAVE EATEN HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOMS AND APARTMENTS OF OUR BOHEMIAN FRIENDS AND THESE MEALS WERE PREPARED GENERALLY BY EACH ONE PRESENT DOING HIS OR HER PART IN MAKING IT A SUCCESS
BUT DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE EXHAUSTED THE WONDERS OF LITTLE ITALY WHEN YOU HAVE LEFT THE STORES FOR THERE IS STILL MORE TO SEE
THIS RECIPE BY THE WAY IS A GOOD ONE TO USE IN A CHAFING DISH SUPPER
PUT THE CHEESE AND BUTTER INTO A DOUBLE BOILER AND WHEN MELTED SMOOTH ADD THE CATSUP AND WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE
WHEN COLD PRESS THE BROTH OUT OF THE CELERY WITH THE HAND GENTLY AND PLACE ON A PLATE
HE TOOK US TO A DWELLING HOUSE IN O'FARRELL STREET HAVING GIVEN PREVIOUS NOTICE OF OUR COMING
OLD AND NEW PALACE ONE CANNOT WELL WRITE A BOOK ON BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF SAN FRANCISCO WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE GREAT HOTEL WHOSE HISTORY IS SO INTIMATELY INTERTWINED WITH THAT OF THE CITY SINCE 1873 WHEN WILLIAM C
THIS HOWEVER MAY BE PREPARED AT ANY TIME AND IS ALWAYS A GOOD MEAL
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE PREJUDICED BY THE SENTIMENT OF THE SURROUNDINGS AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT EXACTLY IN POSITION TO BE GOOD JUDGES
WASH IN COLD WATER AND RUB OFF THE BLACKENED SKIN
MERGING THE POST-PIONEER ERA WITH THE PRE-FIRE ERA CAME THE MAISON DOREE WHICH BECAME FAMOUS IN MANY WAYS
ITALIAN FECUNDITY IS APPARENT EVERYWHERE AND THE FARTHER UP THE STEEP SLOPE OF THE HILL YOU GO THE MORE CHILDREN YOU SEE
HERE IS ONE OF THE PRIMITIVE WINE PRESSES OF ITALY AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SOME IRREVERENT PEOPLE CALL THE RED WINE OF THE ITALIANS CHATEAU LA FEET YOU HAVE BUT TO WATCH THE PROCESS OF ITS MAKING IN THESE TELEGRAPH HILL WINE HOUSES
YOU GAVE THE WAITER A TIP OF FIFTEEN CENTS OR TWO BITS AS YOU FELT LIBERAL AND HE WAS SATISFIED
IT IS WHEN ONE GOES TO THESE PLACES IN THE MORNING AND SEES THE CHEAPNESS OF THESE FOODS THAT HE CAN UNDERSTAND IN A SMALL WAY WHY IT IS THAT SO MANY ITALIAN RESTAURANTS CAN GIVE SUCH GOOD MEALS FOR SO LITTLE MONEY
IT IS ALSO WELL TO REMEMBER NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAIN DISHES ARE AT THEIR BEST AT CERTAIN RESTAURANTS
CLAM FRITTERS WHEN PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE RECIPE GIVEN HEREIN IS ONE OF THE BEST METHODS OF PREPARING THE CLAM AND IT HAS THE PECULIARITY OF BEING SO TASTY THAT ONE FEELS THAT THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH COOKED
BUT ONE RESTAURANT IN THE CITY DEALS EXCLUSIVELY WITH SEA FOOD AND EVEN THERE ONE IS ASTONISHED AT AN OVERLOOKED OPPORTUNITY
COFFEE
BUT THERE WAS THE ATTRACTION OF LIGHT AND LIFE AND LAUGHTER THAT DREW CROWDS NIGHTLY
HERE ALSO WAS FIRST SERVED CHICKEN IN THE SHELL THE DISH FROM WHICH SO MANY LATER RESTAURANTS GAINED FAME
THESE CHEESES ARE OF ALL SIZES AND ALL SHAPES FROM THE GREAT ROUND FLAT CHEESE THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE IN COUNTRY GROCERY STORES TO THE QUEER-SHAPED CACIOCAVALLO WHICH LOOKS LIKE AN INDIAN CLUB AND IS EATEN WITH FRUIT
ON THE BLACKENED WALLS MIGHT STILL BE SEEN SCARRED PICTURES FRINGED BY A ROW OF BLACK CATS ALONG THE CEILING
WINES FROM PARMA AND FROM SICILY AND PALERMO WHERE THE WARM ITALIAN SUNSHINE HAS BEEN THE ARCH-CHEMIST TO BRING PERFECTION TO THE FRUIT OF THE VINE
TWO KINDS OF SOUP
WHEN THE GRINGO CAME TO ITS PIONEER DAYS MUCH OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BOHEMIAN SPIRIT IS DUE
YOU WILL DISCOVER BETTER ARTICLES AT LESS PRICES AT THE LITTLE ITALIAN FRENCH MEXICAN OR CHINESE STORES AND STALLS THAN CAN BE HAD IN THE MOST ARISTOCRATIC STORES IN THE CITY
BOTH ARE GOOD THE LATTER HAVING ADDITIONAL WINES AND DELICACIES
IN SAN FRANCISCO PROBABLY MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE UNITED STATES NOT EVEN EXCEPTING NEW ORLEANS THIS ART HAS FLOURISHED FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE RESULT THAT THE AVERAGE SAN FRANCISCAN IS DISAPPOINTED AT THE FOOD SERVED IN OTHER CITIES OF HIS COUNTRY AND ALWAYS LONGS FOR HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT EVEN AS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL LONGED FOR THE FLESH POTS OF EGYPT
THIS BRINGS US TO THE CRUX OF BOHEMIANISM
CHEESE AND BLACK COFFEE
SIMMER FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN ADD ONE GLASS OF SHERRY WINE WHICH REDUCE TO HALF BY BOILING
POUR INTO TALL GLASSES OR CUPS AND SERVE EITHER HOT OR COLD
SMILE INTO IT AND IT SMILES BACK
HE HAS AN OLD-STYLE FRENCH TABLE D'HOTE DINNER WHICH HE SERVES FOR $1.25 INCLUDING WINE
THE RECIPE FOR THESE IS AS FOLLOWS
BOHEMIA OF THE PRESENT SAN FRANCISCO'S CARE-FREE SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF 1906 WERE COLD
PUT A POUND OF LARD IN A SKILLET AND WHEN BOILING PUT IN THE MIXTURE WITH THE TURKEY AND LET COOK TEN MINUTES SENDING IT TO THE TABLE HOT
INDEED THEY DID NOT LIVE ALL THEIR TIME IN RESTAURANTS
OUR TOAST NOT TO THE FUTURE NOR TO THE PAST
THE OLD DEFINITION OF BOHEMIAN WAS A VAGABOND A WAYFARER POSSIBLY THAT DEFINITION MAY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BE TRUE OF THE PRESENT-DAY BOHEMIAN FOR HE IS A MENTAL VAGABOND AND A MENTAL WAYFARER
EQUALLY UNIQUE YET OF HIGHER STANDARD WAS THE PALACE OF ART RUN BY THE HACKETT BROTHERS IN POST STREET NEAR MARKET
THE FAVORED ONES WHO ASSEMBLED THERE WILL ALWAYS HOLD THAT DINNER IN MOST AFFECTIONATE MEMORY AND TO THIS DAY NOT ONE THINKS OF IT WITHOUT THE CHOKING THAT COMES FROM OVER-FULL EMOTION
AFTER SOAKING FOR A FEW MINUTES DRY THE CHICKEN IN FLOUR AND LAY IN A FRYING PAN IN GOOD BUTTER
COLD FILLET OF SAND-DABS PALACE SELECT SIX NICE FRESH SAND-DABS
THIS IS A SPANISH DISH HAVING BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY BY THE EARLY SPANISH EXPLORERS AND ADOPTED BY THE INDIAN TRIBES WITH WHOM THEY CAME IN CONTACT
THESE PEOPLE HAVE STUDIED GASTRONOMY AS A SCIENCE AND THEY HAVE IMPARTED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE RESULT THAT THE BOHEMIAN SPIRIT ENTERS INTO OUR VERY LIVES AND OUR MINDS ARE BROADENED AND OUR VIEWS OF LIFE AND OUR IDEAS HAVE A WIDER SCOPE
IN HOT OLIVE OIL FRY THE CHICKEN UNTIL A GOLDEN BROWN
WITH SOUP AND FISH SERVE WHITE WINES SUCH AS RHEIN WINE SAUTERNE OR WHITE BURGUNDY
TAKE ONE-HALF POUND OF SWEET BUTTER THREE OUNCES OF CHOPPED SALTED ALMONDS ONE-FOURTH POUND OF CHOPPED FRESH MUSHROOMS A LITTLE CHOPPED PARSLEY THE JUICE OF A LEMON SALT PEPPER AND A LITTLE GRATED NUTMEG
THIS BREAKFAST WILL CONSIST OF BROILED BREAST OF YOUNG TURKEY SERVED WITH BROILED VIRGINIA HAM WITH A SIDE DISH OF CORN FRITTERS
TEXAS TOMMY THE GRIZZLY BEAR AND MANY OTHERS WERE FIRST DANCED HERE AND SOME OF THE FINEST TEXAS TOMMY DANCERS ON EASTERN STAGES WENT FROM THE DANCE HALLS OF SAN FRANCISCO'S BARBARY COAST
BEAT THE YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS AND MIX THEM WITH A TABLESPOONFUL OF THE SOUP AND POUR THIS OVER THE BREAD AND CHEESE
POUR THIS OVER SLICES OF DELICATELY BROWNED TOAST SERVING HOT
IT IS BECAUSE AT SOME TIME OR OTHER I HAVE TIPPED THEM
IN FACT IF ONE WERE SQUEAMISH ABOUT SUCH THINGS SANGUINETTI'S WAS NO PLACE FOR HIM OR HER
REVERTING TO THE ORIGINAL RECIPE
A LIGHTER CLARET WITH GOOD BOUQUET
WASH AND DRY TWO CUPS OF RICE AND PUT INTO THE SOUP AND COOK UNTIL THOROUGHLY DONE AND MODERATELY DRY TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES SERVE HOT OR COLD
AND WHEN YOU ARE PLEASED I CATCH THE HINT OF A PURR IN YOUR THROAT AND FACE
AMONG THE GOOD BOHEMIANS WHO LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO AS A CHILD WHEN IT WAS IN THE POST-PIONEER DAYS AND WHO HAS ENJOYED THE GOOD THINGS OF ALL THE FAMOUS RESTAURANTS IS MRS EMMA STERETT WHO HAS GIVEN US THE FOLLOWING RECIPE FOR CLAM FRITTERS WHICH WE CONSIDER THE MOST DELICIOUS OF ALL WE HAVE EVER EATEN AND WHEN YOU TRY THEM YOU WILL AGREE WITH US
THEN I WONDER IF YOU ARE DREAMING TOO OF TEMPLES ALONG THE NILE WHERE YOU YOWLED AND HOWLED AND LOVED AND PROWLED WITH MANY A SENSUOUS WILE AND BORROWED THE GRACE YOU OWN TODAY FROM THAT OTHER LIFE IN THE FAR-AWAY
WILL YOU LET ME BRING YOU THE BEST THERE IS IN THE HOUSE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND USUALLY WHEN THAT IS THE CASE YOU ARE NOT VERY HUNGRY
NOW FOLLOWED THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE
THERE ARE THREE THINGS IN WHICH AN EASTERNER WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THESE ARE OYSTERS
WHERE CAN WE GET THE BEST FISH WITH SAN FRANCISCO'S WONDERFUL NATURAL ADVANTAGES AS A FISH MARKET ONE IS SOMETIMES SURPRISED THAT MORE ATTENTION IS NOT GIVEN TO PREPARING FISH AS A SPECIALTY
IS A GOLDEN WINE OF MOST AGREEABLE COLOR AND AROMA
IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE MEAT AND YOU THINK THAT OF COURSE IT IS THE BEST AND MOST NOURISHING
ON EVERY HAND ONE COULD FIND LITTLE EATING PLACES ESTABLISHED IN THE STREETS SOME MADE OF ABANDONED BOXES OTHERS OF DEBRIS FROM THE BURNED BUILDINGS AND SOME IN VACANT BASEMENTS AND LITTLE STORE ROOMS WHILE A FEW ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS IMPROVISED WHEELED DINING ROOMS AND WENT FROM ONE PART OF THE CITY TO ANOTHER SERVING MEALS
IT WAS ONLY NATURAL THAT THE EARLY SAN FRANCISCANS SHOULD FOREGATHER WHERE GOOD CHEER WAS TO BE FOUND AND THE OLD EL DORADO HOUSE AT PORTSMOUTH SQUARE WAS REALLY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE FIRST BOHEMIAN RESTAURANT OF THE CITY
THEN PUT IN A TUB WITH A HANDFUL OF SALT AND A QUARTER OF A GALLON OF VINEGAR
SERVE ON A HOT DISH
THAT IS MY OWN IDEA
WE HAVE MET WITH MANY WELL EDUCATED AND WELL RAISED MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE GASTRONOMIC KNOWLEDGE WAS SO LIMITED AS TO BE APPALLING
MARSALA
FIRST LET US GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTY UNDER WHICH WE SECURED THESE RECIPES BY PRINTING THEM JUST AS HE WROTE THEM DOWN FOR US AND THEN WE SHALL ELABORATE A LITTLE AND SHOW THE RESULT OF SKILLFUL QUESTIONING
PROBABLY NOWHERE IN SAN FRANCISCO COULD ONE GET LOBSTER BETTER SERVED THAN IN THE OLD DELMONICO RESTAURANT OF THE DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE
IT WAS IN PARIS THAT A WORLD TRAVELER SAID TO US
1896 AND 1904
FIORINI WILL TELL YOU THAT EACH KIND HAS ITS DISTINCTIVE USE
THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT WE STEAL THE HOURS FROM THE NIGHT TO LENGTHEN OUR DAYS BECAUSE THE GRAY WHISPERING WRAITHS OF FOG HOLD FOR US THE VERY BREATH OF LIFE
THIS PLACE WAS IN A BASEMENT AND HAD MUCH VOGUE AMONG POLITICIANS AND THOSE CONNECTED WITH THE CITY GOVERNMENT
OVER THIS POUR COMMON BROTH UNTIL COVERED AND BRING SLOWLY TO BOILING POINT
ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNED DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DEL MONTE IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
ACCEPTING LUNA'S AS THE BEST TYPE OF THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT OF THE DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE OUR INQUIRY DEVELOPED THE FACT THAT THE DISH ON WHICH HE SPECIALIZED WAS CHILI REINAS AND THIS IS THE RECIPE HE USED IN THEIR PREPARATION
LATER WHEN THE LAND WAS FILLED IN BAZZURO BUILT A HOUSE AT ALMOST THE SAME SPOT AND OPENED HIS RESTAURANT THERE CONTINUING IT UP TO THE TIME OF THE GREAT FIRE IN 1906
IT IS A LONG STEP FROM PLAIN CORN MEAL MUSH TO SCRAPPLE WHICH WE CONSIDER THE HIGHEST AND BEST FORM OF PREPARING THIS SORT OF DISH BUT ALL THE INTERMEDIATE STEPS COME FROM A DESIRE TO PLEASE THE TASTE WITH A CHANGE FROM SIMPLE CORN MEAL
SPRINKLE SOME FINELY CHOPPED GREEN PEPPERS ON TOP AND SERVE VERY COLD
THEN ADD ONE CUP OF CREAM BRING TO A BOIL AND THICKEN WITH TWO YOLKS OF EGGS MIXED WITH A HALF CUP OF CREAM
IT HAS SINCE BEEN REOPENED UNDER THE NAME OF THE PORTOLA-LOUVRE WHERE NOW CROWDS ASSEMBLE NIGHTLY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND WITNESS CABARET PERFORMANCES
YOU MOVE WITH A FELINE GRACE
RUDESHEIMER SCHLOSS
ROAST CHICKEN WITH CHIFFON SALAD
THE RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY THAT APPROACH NEAREST THE OLD BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF PRE FIRE DAYS OF THE FRENCH CLASS ARE JACK'S IN SACRAMENTO STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY
TO THE UNINITIATED VISITOR THE SHRIMPS SO SERVED WERE ALWAYS SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY AND AFTER A FEW FUTILE EFFORTS TO GET AT THE MEAT THEY GENERALLY GAVE IT UP AS TOO MUCH WORK FOR THE LITTLE GOOD DERIVED
PERHAPS YOU WANT A MEAL
SERVE CHATEAUBRIAND SAUCE IN A BOWL
DON'T USE FROZEN POULTRY
THEY HAVE ALL THIS BUT WITH THEM IS LACKING ATMOSPHERE WHERE DO WE FIND SUCH ROMANTICISM AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
SIMILAR TO CHAMBERTIN AND OFTEN CALLED THE KING OF BURGANDY
MANY RESTAURANTS USE CRAB MEAT FOR FLAVORING OTHER DISHES BUT OF ALL THE RECIPES FOR COOKING CRAB WE HAVE FOUND NONE THAT WE CONSIDER SO GOOD AS THAT OF GOBEY'S
IS IT NOT COOKED JUST RIGHT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT WE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A LIMIT TO CAPACITY AND THAT HE HAD FED US WITH SUCH BOUNTIFUL HAND WE COULD EAT NO MORE
STIR IN HALF A GLASS OF SHERRY AND SERVE IN COCKLE SHELLS
SEASON WITH SALT FRESH GROUND BLACK PEPPER CHERVIL AND ONE-QUARTER WHITE WINE VINEGAR WITH TARRAGON TO THREE-QUARTERS OF BEST OLIVE OIL
PEACHES A LA PRINCESSE HALVE SIX FINE PEACHES NOT TOO RIPE AND PLACE IN SAUCEPAN WITH CONCAVE SIDE UP
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE FOLLOWING TYPICAL MENU FOR A DOLLAR DINNER SERVED AT THE FIOR D'ITALIA AND COMPARE IT WITH THE FIFTY-CENT DINNER JUST MENTIONED
CUT THE MEAT INTO SMALL DICE
STRIPED BASS A LA LIVORNAISE
SOMETIMES ONE WANTS A SIMPLE DISH OR PERHAPS TWO AND IT IS WELL TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THEM AND HOW TO ORDER THEM
AS THEY SLIPPED THROUGH THE LEADEN WATER TO THEIR MOORING AT THE WHARF WE COULD SEE THE DECKS AND HOLDS PILED WITH FISH AND CRABS
WHEN MADE TENDER EITHER BY THE CHINESE METHOD OF POUNDING OR BY STEEPING IN VINEGAR THEY SERVE THE PURPOSE OF CLAMS BUT HAVE NOT THE FINE FLAVOR
PEASANT STYLE OF SERVING WAS FOLLOWED
YET WITHAL THE CITY WHERE LIBERTY NEVER MEANS LICENSE AND WHERE BOHEMIANISM IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH BOORISHNESS
SOME SAY IT IS A NECESSARY EVIL AND SUFFER IT
SOME HAVE NOT THE PERCEPTION TO SEE IT
ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS WHEN SOME GERMAN SOCIETY OR CLUB IS GIVING A DANCE OR HOLDING A MEETING AT THE GERMAN HOUSE THE RATHSKELLER IS THE MOST TYPICAL GERMAN PLACE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IF YOU GO AT SUCH A TIME YOU WILL GET ALL THE ATMOSPHERE YOU WILL DESIRE AS WELL AS THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDS IN THE WAY OF GOOD VIANDS
TO SEE THAT WE HAD TO GO ALONG THE DOCKS UNTIL WE CAME TO THE BROADWAY WHARF WHERE PALADINI THE HEAD OF THE FISH TRUST UNLOADS HIS TUGS OF THEIR TONS AND TONS OF FISH
SPANISH EGGS EMPTY A CAN OF TOMATOES IN A FRYING PAN
IN STORES AND RESTAURANTS FREQUENTED BY AMERICANS THEY CATER TO AMERICAN TASTES AND LOSE MUCH OF THE FOREIGN FLAVOR
BECAUSE OF A MISCONCEPTION OF AN IDEA IT HAS SUFFERED MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
LET THE WHOLE STAND IN A BAIN MARIE OR CHAFING DISH UNTIL QUITE HOT
POSSIBLY HIS BEST DISH IS THE FOLLOWING
IN THE REBUILDING THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTIES CONCLUDED TO GIVE THE QUARTER A MORE CHINESE ASPECT AND PAGODA LIKE STRUCTURES ARE NOW TO BE FOUND IN ALL PARTS OF THE SECTION
CAN'T WE GET ACQUAINTED WITH THEM SURE WAS THE RESPONSE
LITTLE ITALY'S CHARM HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BY ARTISTS AND WRITERS AND MANY OF THEM BEGAN THEIR CAREERS WHICH LED TO FAME AND FORTUNE IN LITTLE CHEAP ROOMS ON TELEGRAPH HILL
IN EUROPE THIS FACT WAS RECOGNIZED AND GENERALLY KNOWN SO LONG AGO THAT THE STUDY OF FOOD VALUES AND PREPARATION FOR PROPER ASSIMILATION IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF EVERY WOMAN'S EDUCATION AND TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS THIS BECOME RAISED TO A SCIENCE THAT SCHOOLS AND EVEN COLLEGES IN COOKING ARE TO BE FOUND IN MANY PARTS OF ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY
OF GOOD FLAVOR
FOR TEN CENTS TWO PEOPLE CAN HAVE A DINNER OF TAGLIARINI THAT IS AT ONCE NOURISHING AND SATISFYING IN FLAVOR
HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET THAT WHICH TAKES THE REST OUT OF RESTAURANT AND PUTS THE DIN IN DINNER
IN EITHER OF THESE RESTAURANTS YOU WILL BE SERVED WITH THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDS COOKED THE RIGHT WAY IN CLAY STREET OPPOSITE THE CALIFORNIA MARKET IS THE NEW FRANK'S ONE OF THE BEST OF THE ITALIAN RESTAURANTS AND MUCH PATRONIZED BY ITALIAN MERCHANTS
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DESIRE A DELICATE ENTREE YOU WILL GET THE BEST AT A FRENCH RESTAURANT
IT IS WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITIES THAT A SHOCK COMES FROM THE ENVIRONING DECORATIONS
AS THE ODOR OF THE COOKING FISH CAME UP FROM THE WATER THE WAITING GULLS AND MEN AND WOMEN MOVED A LITTLE CLOSER
STRAIN THE SAUCE THROUGH A FINE COLLANDER AND ADD A FEW RAISINS A PIECE OF HONEY CAKE OR GINGER SNAPS AND THE MEAT OF ONE FRESH TOMATO
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN WHAT THE MEXICANS THEMSELVES REALLY THINK ABOUT AFFAIRS DOWN IN THAT DISTURBED REPUBLIC
ONE OF THE EARLY RESTAURANTS ESTABLISHED AFTER THE FIRE WAS BLANCO'S AT 857 O'FARRELL STREET AND LATER BLANCO OPENED THE POODLE DOG IN MASON STREET JUST ABOVE EDDY
HERE ARE SOME FROM THE SLOPES OF VESUVIUS OR AETNA WITH INBORN KNOWLEDGE OF THE GRAPE AND OF WINE MAKING
WHEN THE RICE TAKES ON A BROWN COLOR ADD SLOWLY CHICKEN BROTH AS NEEDED UNTIL THE RICE IS THOROUGHLY COOKED
AFTER A STRENUOUS DAY OF SIGHT-SEEING YOU WILL SCARCELY FEEL LIKE GETTING UP A GOOD MEAL CONSEQUENTLY THEN YOU WILL FOLLOW THE IDEAS SUGGESTED IN THIS BOOK AND VISIT THE VARIOUS RESTAURANTS THUS OBTAINING A VARIETY BOTH IN FOODS AND IN INFORMATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL NATURE
