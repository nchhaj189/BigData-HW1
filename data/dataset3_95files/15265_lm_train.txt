ZORA LOOKED UP ALMOST HAPPILY--STANDING POISED ON HER FEET AS IF TO TELL OF STRENGTH AND PURPOSE
HER ARMS TWIRLED AND FLICKERED AND BODY AND SOUL SEEMED QUIVERING AND WHIRRING IN THE POETRY OF HER MOTION
IT'S ME COLONEL SHE SAID
OUT THROUGH THE WOOD BLES AND ZORA HAD COME TO THE BROAD RED ROAD
SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF EARNING THIS BY TEACHING ONE OR TWO OF HER SPECIALTIES IN SOME PRIVATE SCHOOL NEAR NEW YORK OR BOSTON OR EVEN IN A WESTERN COLLEGE
HER SHADOWY FIGURE DARTING IN AND OUT AMONG THE TRUNKS TILL THEY CROSSED THE TREE BRIDGE MOVED EVER NOISELESSLY AHEAD
AND THEY NESTLED TOGETHER AMID THE BIG BLACK ROOTS OF THE OAK LAUGHING AND TALKING WHILE THEY ATE
FIRST HE SPOKE THEIR RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE AND SPOKE IT WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE AND AUTHORITY
FOR THAT REASON WE'RE PLANNING A TRUST TO INCLUDE THE RAISING AND MANUFACTURING OF COTTON IN AMERICA
I WAS JUST A VOICE FROM NOWHERE CALLING TO HIM
WE'RE STRIVING BY MAIN FORCE TO PREVENT THIS AND HERE COME YOUR DAMNED NORTHERN PHILANTHROPISTS TO PLANT SCHOOLS
THE TROUBLE WITH NEW TEACHERS WHO COME IS THAT LIKE YOU THEY CANNOT SEE BLACK FOLK AS HUMAN
FOR WASHINGTON IS ITSELF AND SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES
SHE KNEW SHE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE BUT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO NOTE HOW MUCH UNTIL SHE SAW THE STARE--ALMOST THE RECOIL--OF HER HUSBAND THE MUTTERED EXCLAMATION THE STUDIED ALMOST OVERDONE WELCOME
ELSPETH MERELY GRUNTED UNGRACIOUSLY WHILE EYEING THE WHITE WOMAN WITH SUSPICION
HIS FORM WAS COMMANDING HIS VOICE DEEP AND MUSICAL AND HIS EARNESTNESS TERRIBLY EVIDENT
WHY WAS SHE RESTLESS AND VAGUELY ILL AT EASE SO OFTEN THESE DAYS
MONEY TO BUY A SCHOOL FARM
SHE RUSHED THROUGH THE SWAMP
A SLIGHT PAUSE ENSUED
WELL I MUST GET TO TOWN HE FINALLY ANNOUNCED
THE YOUNG ONE A RASCAL
HOW DARES THE BLACK PUPPY TO IGNORE A CRESSWELL ON THE HIGHWAY
IT WAS SO LITTLE--SO LITTLE BESIDE WHAT THIS WOMAN SQUANDERED THE INSISTENT KNOCKING WAS REPEATED LOUDER THAN BEFORE
MISS SMITH FOUND HER SITTING BY THE WINDOW GAZING BLANKLY TOWARD THE SWAMP
OTHER AND STRONGER VOICES GATHERED THEMSELVES TO IT UNTIL TWO HUNDRED WERE SINGING A SOFT MINOR WAIL THAT GRIPPED THE HEARTS AND TINGLED IN THE EARS OF THE HEARERS
THE TEN-THOUSAND-DOLLAR MORTGAGE HAD BUT THREE MORE YEARS AND THAT WOULD END ALL
I'VE GOT IT ALL FIXED
I SHOULD NOT LIKE--TO KILL YOU HE LOOKED AT HER LONG AND STEADILY AS HE PASSED TO HIS DESK
IS IT READY ZORA INQUIRED HELEN
OF COURSE YOU KNOW HOW IT IS IN THE SOUTH CRESSWELL PURSUED THE OPENING HAVING BEEN SO EASILY ACCOMPLISHED
IT WAS ZORA'S CENTRE FOR HER SETTLEMENT-WORK
AFTER ALL IT MIGHT NOT RAIN HE ARGUED AS THEY JOGGED TOWARD TOWN
MARRY HER HIS VOICE CAME SLOW AND FIRM
FRANKLY MRS VANDERPOOL I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN YOU FOR THIS TASK OF HUMAN EDUCATION
HE MET MR EASTERLY COMING IN AND GREETED HIM EFFUSIVELY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEGRO OF TODAY AT ALL
YES A PAUSE
THEY WALKED SILENTLY DOWN THE ROAD TOGETHER--THE OLD FAMILIAR ROAD
IT SHOWED THAT THE CRESSWELLS WERE STILL INTIMATE AND THE CRESSWELLS WERE BOUND TO HIM AND HIS INTERESTS BY STRONG TIES
SHE ASKED HERSELF WHY SHE HAD BEEN SO FOOLISH
MY OWN PEOPLE I AM NOT ASKING YOU TO HELP OTHERS
AMID THIS MIGHTY HALO AS ON CLOUDS OF FLAME A GIRL WAS DANCING
AT OTHER TIMES SHE CLOTHED MISS SMITH'S CLEAR-CUT CORRECT SPEECH IN SOFTER SOUTHERN ACCENTS
NOW IF WE HAD ITALIANS WE MIGHT DO IT YES AND IN A FEW YEARS THEY'D OWN THE COUNTRY THAT'S RIGHT
ARE YOU THE--ER--THE MAN WHO HAD A LETTER TO THE SENATOR YES SIR LET ME SEE IT
THERE WERE YET OTHERS--AND AT THE SIGHT OF THESE BLES STOOD STRAIGHTER AND BREATHED LIKE A MAN
AND THROW THE REST OF OUR CAPITAL AFTER THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WE'VE ALREADY LOST YES AND YOU WERE FOOL ENOUGH TO CONSENT WAIT FATHER--AND DON'T GET EXCITED
HE SHUDDERED AS ONE WHO SEES BEFORE HIM A COLD BLACK POOL WHITHER HIS PATH LEADS
IT SEEMED SO DARK AN ENDING TO SO BRIGHT A DREAM
HE WAS SURE THE ANSWER STOOD THERE IN TEERSWELL'S BITING VULGAR ENGLISH
YOU INTRODUCE ME AND LET ME MAKE MYSELF SOLID
TO FACE THE PROSCRIPTION THE INSULT THE LAWLESS HATE OF THE SOUTH AGAIN--NEVER
I PROMISE YOU CREDIT TO ANY REASONABLE AMOUNT SAID MR TAYLOR I BELIEVE IN COTTON--THE PRESENT PRICE IS ABNORMAL AND MR TAYLOR KNEW WHEREOF HE SPOKE FOR WHEN HE SENT A CIPHER DESPATCH NORTH COTTON DROPPED TO EIGHT AND A HALF
BUT BLES MISSED THIS
THE PREACHER WAS JONES A BIG MAN FAT BLACK AND GREASY WITH LITTLE EYES UNCTUOUS VOICE AND THREE MANNERS
THEN TOO I INSIST THAT IT'S JOLLY TO FOOL THEM DON'T YOU HATE THE DECEPTION SHE CHUCKLED AND PUT HER HEAD TO ONE SIDE
WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE JUDGE
THE PLAN GREW AND SUCCEEDED AND GREY MADE HIS MILLIONS
THIS JUDGE IS THE POOR WHITE YOU OPPOSED IN THE LAST PRIMARY WITHIN A WEEK THE CASE WAS CALLED AND THEY FILED INTO THE COURTROOM
IT WAS NOT WISE TO START EDUCATING THESE NEGROES AND GETTING THEM DISCONTENTED JUST NOW
OH THIS WAS LIFE
THUS THE BEAUTIFUL CLOTH CAME TO ZORA'S ROOM AND WAS SPREAD IN A GLOSSY CLOUD OVER HER BED
OPEN THE DOOR
IT DID NOT LOOK CLEAN BUT ZORA WAS RAVENOUS
THEN HER HAIR--THAT GREAT DARK MASS OF IMMOVABLE INFINITELY CURLED HAIR--BEGAN TO BE SUBDUED AND TWISTED AND COMBED UNTIL WITH STEADY PAINS AND STUDY IT LAY IN THICK TWISTED BRAIDS ABOUT HER VELVET FOREHEAD LIKE SOME SHADOWED HALO
I TELL YOU IT'S GOT TO COME
HOW SUDDENLY THE SEEKER SAW
HER SENSES SLEPT SAVE HER SLEEPLESS EYES
ZORA SHE PRESENTLY BROKE INTO THE GIRL'S ABSORPTION HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE TWENTY-FOUR THE EDUCATION OF ALWYN MISS CAROLINE WYNN OF WASHINGTON HAD LITTLE FAITH IN THE WORLD AND ITS PEOPLE
EMMA'S WAS THE PURE SOUL WHICH SHE MUST OFFER UP TO GOD
BUT I'LL BE GOING TO TOWN AGAIN SOON THE YOUNG LADY SHOWED THAT SHE WAS ANNOYED
SHE TURNED QUICKLY INTO THE SWAMP AND WAITED LOOKING TOWARD THE SCHOOL
WHATEVER LITTLE BEGINNINGS OF FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING HAD ARISEN NOW QUICKLY DISAPPEARED
NOT UNTIL YOU'VE MADE YOUR PILE
UP FROM SERVILITY AND MENIAL SERVICE HE WAS STRUGGLING TO CLIMB TO MONEY AND POWER
HE POINTED HER CARELESSLY TO THE OFFICE IN THE BACK PART
HIS THIN FACE WAS PALE BUT HIS GRAY EYES BURNED WITH THE FIRE OF A ZEALOT
ZORA REALIZED HOW HUMAN THEY WERE AND HOW LIKE THEIR PROBLEMS WERE TO HERS
WELL WE'LL DINE NEXT TUESDAY AND WE'LL HAVE THE CREAM OF OUR WORLD TO MEET YOU HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH
THEY CREPT UP HER LITTLE LIMBS SWIRLED ROUND HER BREASTS AND GLEAMED GREEN AND SLIMY ALONG HER SHOULDERS
JUST WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED WAS HARD TO SAY
THEN STALKS SHOOT UP WITH THREE OR FOUR LEAVES
YES--HOW ABOUT MRS GREY'S EDUCATION SCHEMES
MULES WITH SADDLES
MAY I FORGET GOD WHEN I VOTE FOR TRAITORS AND SLAVE-HOLDERS THE DISCUSSION WAXED WARM AND MISS WYNN TURNED AWAY AND SOUGHT MISS JONES
A NOTE WOULD BE UNWISE
YES INDEED--IF ONLY WE COULD GET DECENT RETURNS FOR IT WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS A MOST VALUABLE CROP SHE TURNED TO HIM INQUIRINGLY
IT NEARLY TOUCHED THE FLOOR
FOR THE TIME BEING SHE WAS SILENT
HE WOULD EXPECT TO BE GREETED WITH RAISED HAT BUT BLES BIT HIS LIPS AND PULLED DOWN HIS CAP FIRMLY
A LAND WHERE ALL THINGS FLOATED IN STRANGE CONFUSION BUT WHERE ONE THING STOOD STEADFAST AND THAT WAS LOVE
MISS TAYLOR LOOKED AT THEM THEN AT MISS SMITH
ANY--ER--INFORMATION--OF COURSE MISS TAYLOR GOT OUT HER NOTES
THEY WERE CHARMINGLY DEFERENTIAL IN THE MATTER OF DROPPED HANDKERCHIEFS BUT TYRANNICAL OF OPINION
OTHERWISE HE WAS THOROUGHLY PRESENTABLE ACCORDING TO THE STRICTEST WASHINGTON STANDARD
FROM THREE SEPARATE SOURCES THE NAME OF ALWYN POPS UP
MEANTIME ALL THINGS WERE ARRANGED FOR A DOUBLE WEDDING AT CRESSWELL OAKS
THEY SWEPT INTO THE AVENUE AND OUT AGAIN THEN UP 14TH STREET WHERE TURNING FOR SOME STREET OBSTRUCTION THEY PASSED A THRONG OF CARRIAGES ON A CROSS STREET
NO--BUT I WANT TO
IF YOU MUTTS THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT THESE BIG BLOKES AT THEIR OWN GAME OF CHEATING NIGGERS YOU'RE DAFFY
SHE DID LOOK LIKE A MAN WITH HER HAT AND COAT AND SHORT HAIR
COME HE WENT INTO THE LARGE CENTRAL HOUSE AND INTO THE LIVING-ROOM THEN OUT ON THE PORCH BEYOND WHICH LAY THE KITCHEN
FROM A RAPID SURVEY MRS CRESSWELL SAW A BLACK SILK STOCKING A BIT OF LACE A TAILOR-MADE GOWN AND A HEAD WITH TWO FULL BLACK EYES THAT WAITED IN CALMLY POLITE EXPECTANCY
THE DOOR OPENED SOFTLY AND UPON THE THRESHOLD STOOD ZORA
THEY HAVE SWEET VOICES AND THEY CAN'T DOFF THEIR UNIFORM
THEN SHE READ IT AFTER HIM ACCURATELY WITH MORE PERFECT EXPRESSION
IT NEEDS A ROOF HE WHIMSICALLY TOLD HER WHEN HIS DAY'S WORK WAS DONE
BELIEVE ME WE APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST A FEW MORE WORDS AND MR CRESSWELL AFTER BENDING COURTEOUSLY OVER HER HAND WITH A DEFERENCE NO NEW ENGLANDER HAD EVER SHOWN WAS RIDING AWAY ON HIS WHITE MARE
DOWN IN THE DARKER PLACES GLEAMED THE MISTY GLORY OF THE DOGWOOD
ALL AT ONCE SHE STOOD STRAIGHT
YES SHE WOULD TOO AFFIRMED THE GIRL AND THEN SHE PAUSED STILL INTENTLY WATCHING HIM
THIS IS MY DUTY
IT WAS ALL WONDERFUL MAGIC TO THE COUNTRY BOY AND HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS AND FILLED HIS LUNGS AND CRIED
SHE NOTED WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST THE YOUNG COLORED WOMAN WHO WAS WATCHING HER FROM THE SIDEWALK
IN THAT THOUGHT-LIFE MORE AND MORE HER REAL LIVING CENTRED
LAST YEAR WHEN YOU PEOPLE CURTAILED COTTON ACREAGE AND WAREHOUSED A BIG CHUNK OF THE CROP YOU GAVE THE MILL MEN THE SCARE OF THEIR LIVES
IF HE COULD BUT FIGHT
LEAVE THE COLORED OUT OF ACCOUNT AS LONG AS THEY ARE DISFRANCHISED
BUT A HUNDRED SEEMED ABSURD
BUT ONCE ENTERED UPON THE GAME IT DROVE HIM TO FEAR AND FRENZY
SHE WAS A WOMAN OF UNUSUAL PERSONAL CHARM BUT HER OWN INTEREST AND AFFECTIONS WERE SELDOM STIRRED
SHE'LL BE REASONABLE WON'T SHE AND PLACATE THE CRESSWELLS
PRESENTLY THE OLD BLACK CABIN LOOMED BEFORE HER WITH ITS WIDE FLAPPING DOOR
I'M NOT A SCHOOL-GIRL BUT A GROWN WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF CARING FOR MYSELF
BUT WHAT DID I SAY SO FUNNY BLES WAS NOW LAUGHING OUTRIGHT
I SEE A WAY IN WHICH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS CAN HELP ME AND MINE AND CLEAR UP MORE MILLIONS THAN ALL OF US CAN SPEND
YOU CAN DEPEND ON TAYLOR OF COURSE ADDED THE LAWYER
AT ANY RATE SAID MR EASTERLY DRILY MR VANDERPOOL'S FIRST STEP TOWARD PARIS LIES IN GETTING THE NORTHERN NEGROES TO VOTE THE REPUBLICAN TICKET
WHY YES--NOT DIRECTLY--BUT ZORA USED TO SPEAK OF IT BLES LOOKED UP QUICKLY
CRESSWELL DROOPED A BIT AFTER EATING HESITATED AND REFLECTED
HER PEOPLE WERE SLOW TARDY BUT THEY WOULD NOT THUS FORGET HER AND DISAPPOINT HER WITHOUT SOME GREAT CAUSE
IF IT STAYED THERE--"MY GOD HE FELT A FAINTNESS STEALING OVER HIM BUT HE BEAT IT BACK AND GULPED DOWN ANOTHER GLASS OF FIERY LIQUOR
THUS FROM THE GRAVE OF YOUTH AND LOVE AMID THE SOFT LOW SINGING OF DARK AND BOWED WORSHIPPERS THE ANGEL OF THE RESURRECTION ROLLED AWAY THE STONE
AFTER THAT WE CHOP OUT THE WEAK STALKS AND THE STRONG ONES GROW TALL AND DARK TILL I THINK IT MUST BE LIKE THE OCEAN--ALL GREEN AND BILLOWY
ALL HER CAREFULLY LAID PLANS SEEMED ABOUT TO BE THWARTED AND HER CASTLES WERE LEANING TOWARD RUIN
I HOPE HE DIDN'T
IT WAS GOD'S OWN CAUSE AND YET BANG
AT THE WORST IT'S SAFER THAN THE DAMNED FOOLISHNESS SHE HAS IN MIND SO IT HAPPENED THAT JOHN TAYLOR WENT SOUTH TO LOOK AFTER LARGE INVESTMENTS AND AS MR EASTERLY EXPRESSED IT TO BRING BACK FACTS NOT DREAMS HIS INVESTMENT MATTERS WENT QUICKLY AND WELL AND NOW HE TURNED TO HIS WIDER AND BIGGER SCHEME
IT'S FINE COTTON AND SHE RAISED IT
BE BRAVE
MANY CAME TO SEE ZORA'S TWIN BALES AS THEY LAY HANDLING THEM AND QUESTIONING WHILE COLONEL CRESSWELL GREW PROUD OF HIS POSSESSION
I'M CLEAN OUT OF ANYTHING TO READ
HER BUXOM COMELINESS WAS SPIRITUALIZED
WHERE WAS THE GIRL--THE SOUL THAT HAD CALLED HIM
NOT WILLING TO WORK LONG FOR THE VISION BUT LEAPING AT IT RASHLY BLINDLY WITH A DEEP-SEATED SENSE OF DUTY WHICH SHE MADE A SOURCE OF OFFENCE BY PREENING AND PARADING IT AND FORCING IT TO ILL-TIMED NOTICE
HE WAS PROMPT TO THE MINUTE AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY THE FIRST GUEST
SHE MOVED SWIFTLY CARRYING A BASKET ON HER ARM
BUT HIS MANNER HAD CHANGED
HE LAUGHED
I DON'T ASK ANYTHING
A NEW BOY SHE MUSED
SHE FELT THE WILD YEARNING TO HELP THEM BEATING IN HER EARS AND BLINDING HER EYES
SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD LOOKED ON HER HUSBAND AS A MEANS NOT AN END
ALWYN ON THE OTHER HAND NEEDED A WIFE
DID COLORED PEOPLE ATTEND THE BALL
SLOWLY THE SUN WAS DARKENED AND PLAINTIVE MURMURINGS PULSED THROUGH THE WOOD
SHE STILL WAS PASSIONATELY INDEPENDENT AND QUEER TENDENCIES MERELY HAD BECOME MANIFEST SOME DOMINANT
I AM NOT PREJUDICED AS MY PARENTS WERE BUT I AM FORESIGHTED
SHE POUNCED UPON MISS SMITH THE MINUTE THAT LADY ENTERED THE OFFICE
EXTRA AND HEART-STRAINING EFFORT HAD BEEN NEEDED TO RAISE THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ADDITIONAL FOR INTEREST MONEY ON THE MORTGAGE LAST YEAR
THE CRIMSON FIRE FLASHED IN ZORA'S EYES AS SHE PASSED THE OVERSEER
THEN WHY DO THEY GO THE ZEST OF THE SEARCH PERHAPS NO SAID ZORA AS SHE NOISELESSLY LEFT THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR
IN THE PARLOR AND HAVE THE SERVANTS ASTOUNDED AND TALKING
HE WOULD GET RID OF TODD MEANTIME
THEY AGREED IN THE DAINTINESS OF THINGS THE ELEGANCE OF DETAIL
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE TOWN AND COUNTRY QUICKLY BEGAN TO CHANGE
WELL IF YOU DON'T WANT TO UNDERTAKE IT ALL RIGHT ZORA LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY ACROSS THE FIELD MR MAXWELL HAS A BIT OF LAND SHE BEGAN MEDITATIVELY
GOOD-MORNING MR CRESSWELL AND MR CRESSWELL AGAIN SAID MR TAYLOR HELPING HIMSELF TO A STRAIGHT-BACKED CHAIR
THERE WAS TRAMPING OF FEET ON THE CABIN FLOOR AND LOUD VOICES AND SINGING AND CURSING
CONTRARY TO HER PURITAN NOTIONS SHE FRANKLY SOUGHT TO BEAUTIFY HERSELF
SHE SWUNG ACROSS THE TREE AND A LOW DELIGHTED CRY BUBBLED ON HER LIPS
STAMPING ONE FOOT ANGRILY HE STRODE JAUNTILY OUT OF THE WOOD TOWARD THE BIG ROAD
IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN HE WORKS HARD A WHILE AND THEN THROWS UP THE JOB
IT WAS A SHREWD MOVE HE SAID
ZORA LEANED HER HEAD BACK WEARILY WATCHING THE LACED BLACK BRANCHES WHERE THE STAR-LIGHT FLICKERED THROUGH--AS COLDLY STILL AND IMMOVABLE AS SHE HAD WATCHED THEM FROM THOSE GNARLED ROOTS ALL HER LIFE--AND SHE MURMURED BITTERLY THE WORLD-OLD QUESTION OF DESPAIR
HE KNEW THAT MRS GREY HELPED MISS SMITH'S SCHOOL AND SUPPOSED SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO
YOU MUST KNOW SETTLEMENT-WORK AND REFORM MOVEMENTS
SHE WAS NOW PENNILESS AND IN A SENSE HELPLESS
THE COLONEL'S VOICE SOUNDED IMPATIENTLY IN THE FRONT HALL
WON'T YOU COME MR ALWYN AND MR ALWYN SAID THAT HE WOULD
WISH I HAD A CIGAR FOR YOU BUT I DON'T SMOKE DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY WHISKEY HANDY NO I DON'T DRINK WELL WHAT THE DEVIL--OH WELL FIRE AWAY NOW SEE HERE
GIVEN THE PICTURE THEY WOULD CHOOSE THE SAME FRAME--BUT THEY WOULD NOT CHOOSE THE SAME PICTURE
THERE CAME A LONG SLOW-GROWING SILENCE
THE WHOLE SQUARE SEEMED LOAFING AND LOLLING--THE WHITE WORLD PERCHED ON STOOPS AND CHAIRS IN DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS
IT SEEMS THAT TOLLIVER GOT CAUGHT TIGHT IN THE COTTON CORNER AND THAT CRESSWELL THROUGH JOHN TAYLOR OFFERED HIM TWICE WHAT HE HAD AGREED TO SELL TO ME FOR AND HE TOOK IT
I AM GOING TO MARRY HER
MARY WAS HAPPY AND VIVACIOUS AND NOTED THE GIRL'S RAPID DEVELOPMENT
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT
YET ZORA WOULD TAKE NO MONEY FROM BLES AND WORKED EARNESTLY AWAY
ALL ABOUT HE MET NEW DEFERENCE AND NEW FRIENDS
I'M NOT FITTED FOR EITHER OF THOSE HIGH OFFICES
HE LOOKED AT THE SCRAWNY IRON MAN OPPOSITE WHO HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIS PRESENCE
ZORA WAS CURLED IN A CHAIR WITH A BOOK
SHE LOVES TO READ AND I GUIDE HER WHILE SHE KEEPS ME UP ON THE LATEST STUFF
HE FOLLOWED EAGERLY BUT CAUTIOUSLY
YES GRANDFATHER SHE FALTERED
THERE WAS SOME TALK OF A STRIKE BUT COLTON THE NEW SHERIFF DISCOURAGED IT
A DESPERATE RESOLVE TO FIND SOME WAY UP TOWARD THE LIGHT IF NOT TO IT FORMED ITSELF WITHIN HER
HARRY CRESSWELL WOULD SOON BE COMING DOWNSTAIRS
ALL NIGHT SARAH SMITH LAY THINKING AND ALL DAY SHE THOUGHT AND DREAMED
ELEVEN O'CLOCK--TWELVE--ONE--CHIMED THE DEEP-VOICED CLOCK WITHOUT BEFORE ALWYN WENT TO BED
IT WAS PITY SHE HAD SEEN THERE NOT LOVE
THERE PULSED A GLORY IN THE AIR
BUT MISS SMITH STOPPED HIM
THIS SMITH SCHOOL PARTICULARLY HAS NEARLY RUINED OUR PLANTATION
IT WAS THE SINGING OF THE BIG MEETING IN THE CHURCH FAR AWAY
WAIT--WAIT
HE DOESN'T FIT ANY OF MY CATEGORIES AND I SUSPECT THAT I DON'T FIT HIS
I'M SO GLAD I MENTIONED THE MATTER
BELOW MARY TAYLOR LINGERED ON THE PORCH IN STRANGE UNCERTAINTY
A BIRD IN THE HAND YOU KNOW
HE WAS STUDIOUSLY SCRUPULOUSLY POLITE IN PRIVATE AND IN PUBLIC DEVOTED
ZORA GAVE NO SIGN OF HAVING SEEN HER
TO BE SURE HE IS
WELL THERE WAS ONE THING
INVOLUNTARILY THE BOY GAVE A GASPING CRY AND AWOKE TO SWAMP AND NIGHT AND FIRE WHILE A WHITE FACE DRAWN RED-EYED PEERED OUTWARD FROM SOME HIDDEN THRONG WITHIN THE CABIN
MISS TAYLOR WAS A LITTLE STARTLED
I WROTE EACH DAY SOMETIMES TWICE SENDING BITS OF VERSE QUOTATIONS REFERENCES ALL SAYING THE SAME THING
HOW WOULD SHE TAKE IT
MY FRIENDS HE SAID TOUCHING HIS FINGER-TIPS AND USING BLANK VERSE IN A MINOR
NO SHE REPLIED SIMPLY
SHE WAS A STRONG WOMAN LITHE AND VIGOROUS LIVING IN THE OPEN AIR AND USED TO WALKING
I--I AM TO BE THE MOTHER OF A CHILD TWENTY-NINE A MASTER OF FATE THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT MISS WYNN SENATOR SMITH WAS SAYING BUT THAT THE SCHOOLS OF THE DISTRICT WILL BE REORGANIZED AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION ABOLISHED SHE ADDED
NOT A MAN WAS THERE WHOM SHE HAD NOT HELPED AND ENCOURAGED NOR WHO HAD NOT PERFECT FAITH IN HER
SHE IS GONE
WE'VE GOT TO VOTE THE NIGGERS JOHN TAYLOR LAUGHED
THE SUN WAS SIFTING BLOOD-RED LANCES THROUGH THE TREES
WHY GREAT JEHOSHAPHAT
THERE HE LAY A WHILE TREMBLING AND AT LAST DRIFTED INTO DREAMLESS SLEEP
THEN AGAIN THE AIR SEEMED SUDDENLY FILLED WITH THAT GREAT AND AWFUL CRY
NO OF COURSE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER
LOOK AT THE MONKEY
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN THE UNDER-WORLD BUT INTELLECTUALLY NOT BY PERSONAL CONTACT
NO LONGER THE MIRAGE AND SEMBLANCE OF WEALTH THE MEMORY OF OPULENCE THE SHADOW OF HOMAGE WITHOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF POWER--NO
HARK HE CRIED HARSHLY
THE WHIP WAS WHIRRING IN THE AIR AGAIN
HELEN CRESSWELL STOOD THERE RADIANT
IT MIGHT NOT RAIN BUT THE SAFEST THING WOULD BE TO WORK AT THOSE DYKES SO HE STARTED FOR SPADE AND HOE
HE MUST WAIT A FEW WEEKS FOR THEM TO PICK THE COTTON--THEN THE END
I'M GOING BACK SOUTH TO WORK FOR MY PEOPLE WHEN THE OLD CAREWORN LOOK STOLE ACROSS MRS VANDERPOOL'S FEATURES
AS SHE DANCED SHE SANG
IF NOW YOU COULD DROP A WORD HERE AND THERE BUT WHY SHOULD I ASKED MRS VANDERPOOL
TAYLOR REPLIED BRIEFLY
SHE STARTED THINKING OF COTTON--BUT AT ONCE SHE PULLED HERSELF BACK TO THE OTHER ASPECT
ARE YOU WALKING SHE ASKED
I CAME FOR THE SEED YOU PROMISED US--THE COTTON-SEED THE HAG WHEELED AND APPROACHED HIM SWIFTLY GRASPING HIS SHOULDERS AND TWISTING HER FACE INTO HIS
HE HAS A SISTER TEACHING IN THE SOUTH--YOU KNOW OF COURSE
SHE GROANED AS SHE READ OF THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE WORLD AND SAW HER OWN VANISHING REVENUES
UNCONSCIOUS RAPT THEY STEPPED OUT INTO THE BIG ROAD SKIRTING THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP
IT IS VERY LONG
WAS THERE AFTER ALL SOME NIGGER-LOVING CONSPIRACY BACK OF THE COTTON COMBINE
BUT FIRST AMERICA
OH SHE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY REMEMBERING
I DID NOT GIVE HIM THE CREDIT SHE DECLARED REPEATING IT
THE CABIN CROUCHED RAGGED AND BLACK AT THE EDGE OF BLACK WATERS
AUNT RACHEL WAS ILL AND EMMA WENT DAILY TO ATTEND HER
THEY SEEMED TO THINK AN ALLIANCE WITH NORTHERN MILLIONS AN HONOR FOR CRESSWELL BLOOD AND THE COLONEL THUMPED THE NEARER BALE VIGOROUSLY
THE INTERESTS OF HER CHARGES WERE ALWAYS UPPERMOST IN HER MIND
HER HEAVY HAIR HAD BURST ITS FASTENINGS AND LAY IN STIFFENED STRAGGLING MASSES BENDING RELUCTANTLY TO THE BREEZE LIKE CURLED SMOKE
I MAY START A CRUSADE FOR NEGRO RIGHTS DON'T BELIEVE IT
THERE HAD BEEN SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT READING ALOUD BETWEEN THEM SOME EVENINGS AGO AND THIS BOOK REMINDED HER OF THEM
SHE MUST OF COURSE GO OVER AND SEE DEAR SARAH SMITH
HOW MUCH
REMEMBERING SOME FORMER SNUBS HIS MANNER WAS LORDLY
THE SUN WAS HANGING JUST ABOVE THE TALLEST TREES OF THE SWAMP WHEN MISS TAYLOR WEARY WITH THE DAY'S WORK CLIMBED INTO THE BUGGY BESIDE BLES
THE NEW WHITE PHYSICIAN IN TOWN JUST FRESH FROM SCHOOL IN ATLANTA BECAME INTERESTED AND HELPED WITH ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS
NO BLACK MAN ORDINARILY CAN SELL HIS CROP WITHOUT A WHITE CREDITOR'S CONSENT ALWYN FUMED
HE AROSE HEAVILY
SHE WENT TO HER ROOM AND SAT DOWN IN THE DARK
THEY HAD WATCHED HIS LIPS MOVE HAD SCANNED EAGERLY HIS DRESS AND THE GOWNED AND DECORATED DIGNITARIES BESIDE HIM
SO THEY PASSED EACH OTHER BY MR CRESSWELL TO TOWN BLES TO THE SWAMP APPARENTLY IGNORANT OF EACH OTHER'S VERY EXISTENCE
YOU AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE BIGGEST PLANTERS COME IN ON THE GROUND-FLOOR OF THE TWO-BILLION-DOLLAR ALL-COTTON COMBINE
I KNOWS SHE SAID WITH IMPISH GLEE LAUGHING LOW MUSIC
EVEN HER DEFECTS--THE HARD-HELD TEMPER THE DEEPLY ROOTED DISLIKES--CAUGHT THEIR IMAGINATION
WHY NOT SHE ASKED
BUT WHEN HE FOUND WE WAS GOIN AWAY HE LOOKED UP SOME MORE DEBTS HOW MUCH I DON'T KNOW ZACTLY--MORE'N A HUNDRED DOLLARS
TO THIS END HE HAD RECOURSE TO TWO SOURCES OF HELP--JOHNSON AND THE WHITES IN TOWN
NOW TOM BE CALM
THEN HE TURNED AND WENT AS HE HAD COME HIS HEAVY FEET CRASHING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH ON AND ON FAINTER AND FAINTER AS TO THE END OF THE WORLD
SOMEHOW HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS PLANTED OVER THERE SHE ASKED ALTHOUGH SHE REALLY DIDN'T CARE
WITH A REVEL OF SHOUTING AND NOISE THE MUSIC SUDDENLY CEASED
IN THE FIRST CARRIAGE WERE MRS GREY AND MRS VANDERPOOL MR CRESSWELL AND MISS TAYLOR
WITH POVERTY WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE FIRST WHITE WALLS OF THE NEW SCHOOL HOME
THAT'S JUST IT DEAR MISS SMITH,--JUST IT
SHE HAD CAUSE TO BE EXTREMELY HAPPY SHE TOLD HERSELF THIS MORNING AND YET SHE WAS PUZZLED TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WAS NOT
ZORA HE WHISPERED I'VE GOT A PLAN WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED STILL WITH BOWED HEAD
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS LOLLING LUXURIOUSLY BUT MRS GREY WAS A LITTLE STIFF FROM LONG TRAVEL AND SAT UPRIGHT
BENEATH THE CLOTHES BENEATH THE BEAUTY OF THE SILVER FLEECE TILL HER FINGERS CLUTCHED AND TORE THE ENVELOPE
BROWN
TODD'S REVIVED BLAIR BILL IS TOO GOOD A THING FOR NIGGERS
THEY'D CRUCIFY ANY SAVIOUR THUS HALF CONSCIOUSLY SENATOR SMITH SALVED HIS CONSCIENCE WHILE HE EXTRACTED A CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM HIS NEW YORK MAIL
SHE SAW NEITHER MISS TAYLOR NOR THE LONG STRAIGHT ROWS OF DESKS AND FACES
HE SMILED AND CONTINUED
SHE WAS GLAD AND SHE CHOKED BACK THE SOB THAT STRUGGLED AND FOUGHT IN HER THROAT
BUT--IT SEEMS TO ME--THAT'S THE MODERN IDEA OF TAKING CULTURE TO THE MASSES FRANKLY THEN THE MODERN IDEA IS NOT MY IDEA
AND THEN TOO FOR NEW TEACHERS
WHEN THE NEW LABOR OFFICIALS TOOK CHARGE OF THE COURT AND THE BREAK OCCURRED BETWEEN COLONEL CRESSWELL AND HIS SON-IN-LAW TAYLOR FOUND THAT SEVERAL DAMAGE-SUITS WERE LIKELY TO COST HIM A CONSIDERABLE SUM
FINDING THAT HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME SHE DETERMINED TO TELL HIM--IT WAS SO GOOD TO BE DOING SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
I DON'T WANT YOUR OLD GIFTS SHE ALMOST HISSED
THE LADIES WERE IN THE PARLOR WHERE THE FEMALE EASTERLYS WERE PROSTRATING THEMSELVES BEFORE MRS VANDERPOOL
YES HE LEANED TOWARD HER
SHE KNEW AS SHE ASKED--BECAUSE SHE HAD WANTED ALL NOT A PART--EVERYTHING LOVE RESPECT AND PERFECT FAITH--NOT ONE THING COULD SHE SPARE THEN--NOT ONE THING
AND KILL THE PLANTATION SYSTEM OH MAYBE SOME TIME OF COURSE
THERE WAS A STUDY TABLE AND A SMALL BOOKSHELF HOLDING A FEW BOOKS ALL SIMPLE AND CLEAN
MY FATHER WAS PRESIDENT
WELL ASKED CRESSWELL MAINTAINING HIS COMPOSURE BY AN EFFORT HOW ARE THINGS GREAT RETURNED TAYLOR
ACTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SNEERED CRESSWELL FOR HE COULD NOT IMAGINE ANY ONE UNWELCOME AT A NEGRO BALL
THEN WITH AN AWFUL FLASH OF ENLIGHTENMENT SHE REALIZED WHAT HER LIE MIGHT MEAN AND HER HEART PAUSED
THE GIRL STARED
YOU ARE GOING TO MARRY THE MAN THAT SOUGHT ZORA'S RUIN WHEN SHE WAS YET A CHILD BECAUSE YOU THINK OF HIS ARISTOCRATIC POSE AND PRETENSIONS BUILT ON THE POVERTY CRIME AND EXPLOITATION OF SIX GENERATIONS OF SERFS
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS NOW SEE
I'M A SOUTHERNER AND I HONOR THE OLD ARISTOCRACY YOU REPRESENT
YOUR TIE QUITE ATTRACTED ME SHE SAID
SHE BADE HIM GOOD-NIGHT CHEERILY AND THEN STOLE AWAY TO THE WOOD CROUCHING BENEATH THE GREAT OAK AND BITING BACK THE GROANS THAT TREMBLED ON HER LIPS
IT IS CERTAINLY NICE FOR THEM TO KNOW WHAT A CLEAN PLACE IS COMMENTED MRS GREY
BUT WHO
PERFECTLY
STUFF SHE QUERIED BLANKLY
HE CARRIED IT TO ZORA IN THE WOOD AND UNROLLED IT BEFORE HER EYES THAT DANCED WITH GLAD TEARS
HE LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY THEN INTERRUPTED SAYING KINDLY
YOU CAN HAVE IT FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU GIT THE CASH IN A WEEK WITH A MUTTERED OATH HE RODE ABRUPTLY OFF
THE MONEY WAS READY BUT MR TOLLIVER SEEMED BUSY OR HESITATING
THEORETICALLY SHE HAD ALWAYS TREATED IT WITH DISDAINFUL EASE
I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT SO RICH BUT THAT MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED FAINTLY
DON'T YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO INTERFERE WITH COLONEL CRESSWELL'S TENANTS HE STATED THE DEALERS ATTITUDE AND ALWYN SAW LIGHT
BUT SHE ALSO LOOKED SWEET AND GOOD WITH THAT PECULIAR INNOCENCE WHICH PEERS OUT UPON THE WORLD WITH CALM ROUND EYES AND SEES NO EVIL BUT DOES METHODICALLY ITS SIMPLE EVERYDAY WORK
MISS SMITH WOULD JIM DO TO DRIVE NO SHARPLY
THE GIRL STARED AT MISS SMITH IN HONEST IF UNPARDONABLE AMAZEMENT
HER THICK CRISP HAIR WAS FROWSY AND RUMPLED AND THE LONG CURVES OF HER BARE YOUNG ARMS GLEAMED IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE GLOWING WITH VIGOR AND LIFE
BY THE BYE I MET SOME CHARMING ALABAMA PEOPLE LAST WINTER IN MONTGOMERY--THE CRESSWELLS
THEY HAD NOT UTTERLY DEPARTED HOWEVER BUT CAME CROWDING BACK IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT
BUT THEY CAN'T BEAT COTTON AND SAY JOHN TAYLOR YOU'RE MY FRIEND CRESSWELL STRETCHED HIS HAND ACROSS THE DESK AND AS HE BENT FORWARD THE PISTOL CRASHED TO THE FLOOR
SHE TOO STOPPED AND SOON SAW WHOM HE WAS WATCHING
I DON'T BELIEVE IN STANDING ON STUPID CEREMONY CRESSWELL THANKED HER WITH QUIET CORDIALITY AND SUGGESTED THAT WHEN HE WAS DRIVING BY HE MIGHT PICK HER UP IN HIS GIG SOME MORNING
WELL TOM SHE RESPONDED GIVING HIM A LANGUID HAND
ZORA SITTING SHADOWED ON THE FARTHER BALE DREW BACK HER HAND QUICKLY AT THE CONTACT AND STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
I--I SHE CHOKED AND FALTERED AND HE DREW FARTHER AWAY--"I BEGAN RUNNING AWAY AND THEY HUNTED ME THROUGH THE SWAMPS
THEY'RE TALKING OF THE COMING CAMPAIGN SAID MISS WYNN
ZORA THE CRY SEEMED WRUNG FROM HIS HEART BY CONTRITION
LOOK ROUND YOU SHE TOLD HIM OF THE VISITORS
AND TOO CULTURE AND WORK--WERE THEY INCOMPATIBLE
OH HE WAS AN INNOCENT--A BLIND BABY--THE JOKE AND LAUGHING-STOCK OF THE COUNTRY AROUND WITH YOKELS GRINNING AT HIM AND PALE-FACED DEVILS LAUGHING ALOUD
BE A MAN ALWYN STRAIGHTENED UP AND FELT HIS DOUBTS GOING
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS BOTH ASHAMED AND GRATEFUL
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS SAFE SIR
AND I'SE GOT A LITTLE SHACK DAR AND A BIT OF LAND WHAT I'SE TRYING TO BUY OF COLONEL CRESSWELL YAS'M OF DE CUNNEL AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN BUYING IT GOING ON TEN YEAR NOW
HELEN HAD A GOOD CRY AND THEN CAME A WILD RUSH TO GET JOHN TAYLOR'S CLOTH READY
CONGRESS WOULD BE WELL REPRESENTED AND THE BOOM FOR CRESSWELL AS AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE WAS ALMOST VISIBLE IN THE AIR
I DIDN'T NEED YOU
THERE CAME AN AWFUL PLEADING IN HER EYES
AIN'T NO CHANCE BETWIXT HERE AND DANVILLE AS I KNOWS ON ZORA VIEWED HER PLIGHT WITH A CERTAIN DISMAY--TWELVE HOURS WITHOUT FOOD
IT'S AS BAD AS THE EDUCATION BILL BUT YOUR WIFE IS ENCOURAGING IT AND WE THOUGHT YOU WERE BACK OF IT CRESSWELL STARED IN BLANK AMAZEMENT
BUT ZORA EAGERLY SURVEYED THE PROSPECT
CERTAINLY NOT
SHE HAD LONG OUTGROWN THE BOY AND GIRL AFFECTION
A MAN WHO WOULD BE GREAT AS THE WORLD COUNTED GREATNESS RICH HIGH IN POSITION POWERFUL--WONDERFUL BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS BLACK
FOR THEIR FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD THE WONDER OF THE SWAMP
TWENTY-SEVEN THE VISION OF ZORA HOW ZORA FOUND THE LITTLE CHURCH SHE NEVER KNEW
SIT DOWN HERE AND REST SHE LOOKED AT HIM UNWAVERINGLY
IN A MOMENT A DOZEN MEN WERE ON HIM AND HE APPEALED AND EXPLAINED IN VAIN--THE GUN WAS DAMNING EVIDENCE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SHE SAID
HER FACE HAD FLAMED CRIMSON AND THEN WENT DEAD WHITE
WHAT MRS CRESSWELL FORGOT MRS VANDERPOOL SENSED UNERRINGLY
THEY WERE FAR AWAY
ICE SHE WHISPERED
THIS COURSE TO HER HUSBAND'S FORMER PARTNER AND PRESENT EXECUTOR MR EDWARD EASTERLY WAS NOT ONLY FOOLISH BUT WICKED AND INCIDENTALLY DISTINCTLY UNPROFITABLE TO HIM
WELL SEE CRESSWELL AND PUT IT TO HIM STRONG
AFTER THAT THE WAY IS CLEAR MRS VANDERPOOL MUSED
AND COTTON SHE ASKED
IS THAT AN EXCUSE FOR SAYING IT THE FACTS OUGHT TO BE KNOWN YES BUT OUGHT YOU TO TELL THEM IF NOT I WHO SOME ONE WHO IS LESS USEFUL ELSEWHERE AND WHOM I LIKE LESS CARRIE HE HAD BEEN INTENSELY EARNEST
SHE HESITATED
I THINK THERE'S TWO BALES TWO BALES
THEN HE STUMBLED OVER A RUG AND SAVED HIMSELF ONLY TO STEP ON MISS JONES'S SILKEN TRAIN
THEY MISSES ME THESE DAYS BECAUSE THEY IS SHADOWY THINGS THAT SING AND SMELL AND BLOOM IN DARK AND TERRIBLE NIGHTS MISS TAYLOR STARTED UP
GIVE UP YOUR WANTS
THE BUYING OF THE SWAMP 316 THIRTY-FOUR
BUT HE WON'T LIE AND I NEEDED HIM
YES THAT WILL MAKE ABOUT TWO BALES OF LINT
BUT MRS VANDERPOOL SAW HER AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT THE TALL TRAGIC FIGURE THAT LEANED SO DOLOROUSLY BESIDE THE FREIGHT CAR
ONE OF THE POOR WHITES WHO HAD STRUGGLED UP AND FAILED
ZORA DON'T DENY THAT YOU TOOK MY PIN FROM THE DESK THIS AFTERNOON THE TEACHER COMMANDED SEVERELY
SHE WAS BLUE-EYED AND GOLDEN-HAIRED
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
FARMERS OF SOUTH SMASH EFFORT TO BEAR MARKET
THE NIGHT SEEMED ALL FOOTSTEPS AND WHISPERS
DESPITE HERSELF SHE SMILED AGAIN
THEN THERE WAS THE FACT OF THEIR COLOR
BUT I AM AFRAID THAT WILL NOT BE MUCH MISS WYNN HESITATED
IT TYPIFIED HAPPINESS
PERHAPS A MORTGAGE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ENDOWMENT
THEY CHATTED ALONG INDIFFERENTLY OF THE CROPS HER BROTHER'S NEW BABY THE PROPOSED MILL
IT'S ALL PICKED SIR BUT WHERE IS IT IF YOU'LL SEND A WAGON SIR BUT THE COLONEL HARDLY WAITED
HE REFUSES TO WORK A YEAR OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS COLONEL CRESSWELL PAID HIS FINE AND TOOK HIM IN CHARGE
MRS CRESSWELL WOULD SAUNTER DOWN OF MORNINGS
SEND COTTON TO TWELVE CENTS
THE SWAMP WAS LIVING VIBRANT TREMULOUS
I DO NOT KNOW
ONCE CONVINCED OF THIS SHE LET HER IMAGINATION PLAY AND SAW THE LINE EVEN WHERE IT DID NOT EXIST
IT WAS ON THE CONTRARY MOST EXTRAORDINARY
OTHERWISE SHE SHUDDERED AT THE SMOOTH LIE AND CLASPED HIM CLOSER PUTTING HER CHEEK TO HIS
SHE ROSE WITH A START FOR THERE WAS WORK TO DO
IN THE FIELD OF THE SILVER FLEECE ALL HER POSSIBILITIES WERE BEGINNING TO FIND EXPRESSION
LIFT UP YOUR HEADS THEN YE GATES OF PREJUDICE AND HATE AND LET THE KING OF GLORY COME IN
I HATE HIM
SHE THOUGHT OF THE NOISY FLAMING CABIN AND THE DARK SWAMP
IT IS STATED ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT THE WIDOW OF THE LATE MULTIMILLIONAIRE JOB GREY WILL ANNOUNCE A LARGE AND CAREFULLY PLANNED SCHEME OF NEGRO EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH AND WILL RICHLY ENDOW SCHOOLS IN SOUTH CAROLINA GEORGIA ALABAMA LOUISIANA AND TEXAS CRESSWELL FINALLY THRUST HIS FOOD AWAY
ZORA TOOK IT OUT SILENTLY AND OPENED IT AND THE BEAUTY OF IT LIGHTENED THE ROOM
AND THEY WEPT TOGETHER
HE TOO HAD TURNED TO HER AS HE SAW HER COME FROM ZORA'S HOME
YOU HAVE NO WIFE AND BABIES DEPENDANT ON YOU
GOOD-AFTERNOON BLES"--USING HIS FIRST NAME TO SHOW HIM HIS PLACE AND THEN INWARDLY RECOILING AT ITS NOTE OF FAMILIARITY
SHE TURNED SLOWLY AND SMILED
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN ASKED ZORA
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THIS RELIGIOUS REVIVAL IN HER DAYS OF HURRIED PREPARATION AND THE PREACHER HAD USED HER ABSENCE AND APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AGAINST HER AND HER WORK
WELL NOW WE THINK YOU'RE JUST THE MAN TO TAKE THE STUMP DURING SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER AND CONVINCE THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THEIR REAL INTERESTS I DOUBT IF I COULD SIR
SHE LAUGHED
NOW THAT IT WAS HIGH THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO AND MANY SURRENDERED TO THE TRUST
I'M FAR TOO POOR
A HUNDRED OR MORE SHOTS RANG OUT
THAT SHADOWY WORLD-IN-WORLD WITH ITS ACCUSING SILENCE ITS EMPHATIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY
BUT SHE HAS LOYALTY AND PLUCK
YOUR HEART IS GOOD BUT YOU NEED STRONG PRACTICAL ADVICE
IN FACT SAID CRESSWELL GRAVELY THE CHIEF CRITICISM I HAVE AGAINST YOUR NORTHERNERS SCHOOLS FOR NEGROES IS THAT THEY NOT ONLY FAIL TO ENLIST THE SYMPATHY AND AID OF THE BEST SOUTHERNERS BUT EVEN REPEL IT THAT IS VERY WRONG--VERY WRONG COMMENTED THE ENGLISHMAN WARMLY A SENTIMENT IN WHICH MRS GREY HASTENED TO AGREE
TO SOME SUCH A REVELATION OF GRACE AND WOMANLINESS IN THIS HOYDEN THE GENTLE SWELLING OF LANKNESS TO BEAUTY OF LOWLINESS TO SHY SELF-POISE WAS A SUDDEN JOY TO OTHERS A MERE BLINDNESS
THE LABORERS GOT TOGETHER AND AT THE NEXT ELECTION THEY MADE A CLEAN SWEEP JUDGE SHERIFF TWO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE REGISTRARS OF VOTES
LOOKS LIKE A MASCOT
CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MR EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
ENTERING HER MOTOR SHE DROVE NEAR THE ADDRESS AND THEN PROCEEDED ON FOOT
SHE MOTIONED ZORA AWAY AND STRETCHING HER HANDS PALMS UPWARD TO THE SKY CRIED WITH DRY AND FEAR-STRUCK GASP
THIS HE ANNOUNCED IS JONES THE BAPTIST PREACHER--BEGGING AH LADY,"--IN MELLOW UNCTUOUS TONES--"I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE POOR BLACK FOLKS WOULD DO WITHOUT MR CRESSWELL--THE LORD BLESS HIM SAID THE MINISTER SHOVING HIS HAND FAR DOWN INTO HIS POCKET
HOW MUCH MORE BOODLE DO THEY WANT THAT'S WHAT'S BOTHERING US ANNOUNCED A MEMBER
WHAT WOULD THEY SAY IF HE FAILED TO GET THE OFFICE
DREAMS VAGUELY--"DREAMS
THE LABORERS FOUND THAT THEIR POLITICAL POWER GAVE THEM LITTLE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE AS LONG AS THE THREATENING CLOUD OF NEGRO COMPETITION LOOMED AHEAD
SHE HURRIED TO THE WILLARD HOTEL AND WATCHED WALKING UP AND DOWN THE OPPOSITE SIDEWALK
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS ABOUT HER A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE THAT HE DID NOT LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH WOMEN
SHE WOULD LET BYGONES BE BYGONES
A VERY TOUCHING LETTER TOO ABOUT THE POOR BLACKS
WILL YOU GO SOUTH WITH MR CRESSWELL
THEN HE AWOKE TO THE LIGHTED CHURCH AND THE MOVING WELL-DRESSED THRONG
THE SILVER FLEECE HOW WAS IT
NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF-HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY--NO NOT EVEN THAT
FORGOT ALL ABOUT MARY JOHN TAYLOR AFTER A LITTLE DESULTORY TALK FOLLOWED HIS HOST UP-STAIRS
EARLY DECEMBER FOUND THE CRESSWELLS DOMICILED IN A SMALL HOUSE IN DU PONT CIRCLE WASHINGTON
I THINK NOT
SHE HAD EXPECTED HIS FATHER
THE TRIAL PROCEEDED AND ZORA STATED HER CONTENTION
WHY DREAMS AIN'T--NOTHING OH YES THEY IS SHE INSISTED HER EYES FLAMING IN MISTY RADIANCE AS SHE SAT STARING BEYOND THE SHADOWS OF THE SWAMP
NEGROES MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT ALL AND BEEN RICH
HE HAD BEEN JUDGING AND WEIGHING HER FROM ON HIGH LOOKING DOWN UPON HER WITH THOUGHTS OF UPLIFT AND DEVELOPMENT
THERE WAS NOTHING UNJUST ABOUT SUCH A COURSE HE ARGUED FOR NEGROES ANYWAY WERE TOO LAZY AND SHIFTLESS TO BUY THE LAND
THE INNOCENCE AND WONDER OF THE CHILD AND IN THEIR PLACE HAD GROWN UP SOMETHING TO HIM INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND OCCULT
BUT HARRY APPARENTLY WAS AS CONTENT AS EVER WITH DOING NOTHING
EVEN HIS INEXPERIENCED EYE COULD DISCERN THAT MISS WYNN WAS VERY POPULAR AND THAT MOST OF THE MEN WERE RIVALS FOR HER ATTENTIONS
STILL THINKING OF GOING ARE YOU SAM ASKED CRESSWELL CARELESSLY WHEN THE SERVANT APPEARED
SHE MOTIONED THE BOY AND GIRL AWAY TO THE THICKET AT THE EDGE AND STOOD STILL AND BLACK IN THE MIDST OF THE CLEARED ISLAND
WELL THEN
WHERE HAD SHE KNOWN HIM
SHE SORTED PAPERS DUSTED THE BUREAU HUNG A CURTAIN
THE SUN WAS SINKING FAST
WHAT PIN SHE RETURNED UNMOVED
I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHE DISPUTED DISAPPEARING IN THE WOOD AND RETURNING WITH A PINE-KNOT
WHAT MUST HE PAY FOR SUCCESS
HE FELT AGAIN THE WARM QUIVER OF HER BODY
ONE DAY NOT LONG SINCE HE HAD MET A COLORED PERSON WHO PERSONIFIED HIS PERPLEXITY CONCERNING NEGROES
IT WAS A SCHOOL OF WORK AND LOVE
SHE MUST PAY THE UTTERMOST FARTHING
LETTER AFTER LETTER CAME FROM OLD FRIENDS OF THE SCHOOL FULL OF CONGRATULATIONS BUT NO MONEY
HER ROOM IS ONE OF THE BEST AND FILLED WITH BOOKS AND BRIC-A-BRAC
NO SHE INVOLUNTARILY REPLIED REGRETTING THE WORD THE MOMENT SHE HAD UTTERED IT
WHY WHAT'S THERE THE SWAMP SHE SAID MYSTERIOUSLY
HE HEARD MISS SMITH CALLING HOWEVER
NEVER SHE GASPED
YET THE GIRL WALKED STEADILY ON
WHAT IS TODD'S BILL ASKED HARRY CRESSWELL DARKENING
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE WHEN I TOLD HIM SHE CONCLUDED
PLEASE RUN AND TELL THEM OF THE LEGACY SHE BEGGED
YES SAID BLES AND THEN MORE QUICKLY--"IT IS THE CHRIST CHILD--GOD'S BABY GOD IS THE FATHER OF ALL THE LITTLE BABIES AIN'T HE BLES WHY YES--YES OF COURSE
THEN ONCE WELL BEGUN HER BUSY EAGER MIND FLEW WITH A RAPIDITY THAT STARTLED
THE COLONEL SAT UP
ZORA SHOOK HERSELF FROM THE TRANCE-LIKE HORROR AND PASSED HER HANDS ACROSS HER EYES TO DRIVE OUT THE NIGHTMARE
THE GREEN AND WHITE OF THE COTTON BILLOWED AND FOAMED ABOUT HER BREASTS
THEN TOO ZORA WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN THAT TIME WHAT THERE IS ALWYN'S CAREER AND MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKED INTO ZORA'S EYES
BLES TOO WAS THINKING
MY BROTHER WANTS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE COUNTY MR CALDWELL AND I AM ONLY A TEACHER AND DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT CONDITIONS HERE AH
WE'SE LIGHTER AND CUNNINGER
HE SCANNED CURIOUSLY PLATO'S REPUBLIC GORKY'S COMRADES A CYCLOPAEDIA OF AGRICULTURE BALZAC'S NOVELS SPENCER'S FIRST PRINCIPLES TENNYSON'S POEMS
HE WAS EVIDENTLY FEELING FOR THE SYMPATHY OF HIS AUDIENCE AND WHILE THEY WERE NOT ENTHUSIASTIC THEY WARMED TO HIM GRADUALLY AND HE CERTAINLY WAS STRONGLY IMPRESSING THEM
WITH A HALF-DOZEN OF YOUNGER ONLOOKERS SHE UNHITCHED TEAMS AND RODE ACROSS THE LAND CALLING AT THE CABINS
THE PARTY CAME IN LAUGHING AND CHATTING
IT'S A REPUBLICAN BILL TO BE SURE
SHE WALKED PLACIDLY TO THE TABLE WHERE SHE TOOK UP A HANDFUL OF COLD CORN-BREAD AND MEAT AND THEN WENT OVER AND CURLED UP BY THE FIRE
THE SUM SEEMED FABULOUS AND HE WAS IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN
BUT NO BUTS ABOUT IT
IF WE CAN MAKE BLES DO SOME FOOL TALKING AND GET IT INTO THE PAPERS HE'LL BE DITCHED AND I'LL BE REGISTER GREAT SHOUTED TEERSWELL
THEY ARE CAPITALIZED AT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT ONLY EARNEST BUT EXPERT
I HADN'T NOTICED IT SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE LAY THE WAY
THE JUDGE FELT IMPELLED TO BE OVER-GRUFF
WHAT IS THE MATTER ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL REPEATED
DO FOOLS LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE SALVATION HE SNEERED HOLDING OFF THE HEADLINES AND GLANCING AT THEM
THEY MURDER BURN AND MAIM US OH--OH MOANED THE PEOPLE SWAYING IN THEIR SEATS WHEN WE CRY THEY MOCK US
A TINY BEDROOM WAS DISCLOSED WITH ONE BROAD WINDOW LOOKING TOWARD THE SWAMP
SHE CARRIED A BIG RED-SEALED BUNDLE
HE COULD ONLY CLASP HER HAND TIGHTLY AND AGAIN DOWN THEY RACED THROUGH THE WOOD
YOU ARE DARK AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT MISS WYNN AND HER SET RATHER--WELL PREFERRED THE LIGHTER SHADES OF COLORED FOLK MISS WYNN LAUGHED LIGHTLY
IS IT YO'S YES GROANED THE MULTITUDE
WILLINGLY WILLINGLY HER VOICE DROPPED ABRUPTLY TO A TREMULOUS WHISPER
JOHN TAYLOR HAD CAREFULLY MENTIONED SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A PRICE HE WAS WILLING TO PAY AND PERHAPS MORE WAS CRESSWELL BACK OF TAYLOR
HE FROWNED AND RODE ON
WE DON'T JUST BLURT INTO THE NEGRO PROBLEM
IN FAVORABLE SURROUNDINGS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ARISTOCRAT AND AN EPICURE
THREE MISS MARY TAYLOR MISS MARY TAYLOR DID NOT TAKE A COLLEGE COURSE FOR THE PURPOSE OF TEACHING NEGROES
AND BESIDES THAT GOOD MISS SMITH HAS GONE AND GRAFTED A NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE ON A TROPICAL HEART AND--DEAR ME!--BUT IT'S A GORGEOUS MISFIT
MRS CRESSWELL HAD JUST HAD A BIT OF NEWS WHICH ONLY HE WOULD FULLY APPRECIATE
MR CRESSWELL LOOKED CLEAN-CUT AND HANDSOME AND MISS TAYLOR SEEMED COMPLACENT AND RESPONSIBLE
AND WHAT ESPECIALLY PUZZLED HER WAS THAT THIS HAD NOT HAPPENED BEFORE
YOU WILL GO ON THE FINANCE COMMITTEE TOMORROW
BUT--BUT BLES SHE FALTERED
WAS NOT EVERYTHING CLEAR
COME IN HE INVITED HER
BUT HE WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND COLONEL CRESSWELL'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH MR EASTERLY OPENED HIS EYES TO THE BENEFICENT IDEALS OF NORTHERN CAPITAL
WE'LL NEVER GET OUR RIGHTS IN THIS LAND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE HAD EJACULATED SHOCKED
SHE REALIZED THAT THERE WERE DEPTHS TO THIS MATTER THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND HER IRRITATION INCREASED
I'LL TELL MISS SMITH MARY TAYLOR SUDDENLY FELT HERSELF A JUDGE OF CHARACTER
HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND CLENCHED HIS HANDS
HE THOUGHT HE SAW THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAD BEEN A THORN IN HIS FLESH EVER SINCE TOLLIVER IN A FIT OF RAGE HAD SOLD LAND FOR A NEGRO SCHOOL
I'VE BEEN WAITING THIRTY YEARS ROBERT SHE SAID WITH FEELING AND HE HUNG HIS HEAD
I MUST HAVE NODDED OVER MY BOOK,"--LOOKING TOWARD THE LITTLE VERANDAH AT THE FRONT OF THE UPPER HALL WHERE HER EASY CHAIR STOOD WITH HER BOOK
SHE MIGHT EVEN STAY TO THE WEDDING IF THE NEW PLANS MATURED
EIGHTEEN THE COTTON CORNER ALL OVER THE LAND THE COTTON HAD FOAMED IN GREAT WHITE FLAKES UNDER THE WINTER SUN
IF ELSPETH CHOSE TO SIGN A CONTRACT OF WORK FOR HER TO-MORROW IT WOULD MEAN SLAVERY JAIL OR HOUNDED RUNNING AWAY
EASTERLY GREETED SMITH QUIETLY
BUT HER FACE WAS A MASK
STOCKINGS WERE SMOOTHER
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO CONTEMPLATE HELEN'S MARRIAGE IN DISTANT PROSPECT BUT THE SUDDEN ALMOST PEREMPTORY DESIRE FOR MARRYING AT EASTERTIDE A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AWAY WAS ABSURD
UNGAINLY AND ALWAYS IN A DESPERATE UNACCOUNTABLE HURRY
SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS CHANGED BUT SHE DID NOT QUITE REALIZE HOW CHANGED UNTIL NOW AS SHE STOOD AND GAZED
I CAN DO NOTHING SHE BEGAN
NOW I OFFERED HER HUSBAND THE FRENCH AMBASSADORSHIP PROVIDED SHE'D KEEP THE SOUTHERNERS FEELING GOOD TOWARD US
THAT IS I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
THE TRAIN PULLED AWAY ITS HOARSE SNORTING WAKING VAGUE ECHOES IN THE FOREST BEYOND
HE STARED AT HER HELPLESSLY
HE WAS NO MORALIST BUT HE HAD HIS CODE AND HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND COLONEL CRESSWELL
ALL AT ONCE SHE HATED HIM AND HATED HIS ARISTOCRATIC REPRESSION
WHY WAS IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR TAYLOR HE CONCLUDED
SHE SAT NOT FOUR FEET FROM HIM LEANING AGAINST THE GREAT TREE HER EYES NOW LANGUOROUSLY ABSTRACTED NOW ALERT AND QUIZZICAL WITH MISCHIEF
H'M HE REFLECTED DEPRECATINGLY WIPING HIS BROW
HOWDY ZORA ZORA LOOKED
THE DORMITORIES WERE NEAT AND THE LADIES EXPRESSED GREAT PLEASURE IN THEM
SHE IS SO FAR BENEATH HIM HOW SO SHE IS A BOLD GODLESS THING
NEGROES SHE SAID HAVE BEEN REGISTERS OF THE TREASURY AND RECORDERS OF DEEDS HERE IN WASHINGTON AND DOUGLAS WAS MARSHAL
SHE KNEW NONE OTHER WITH THE SAME BUILD THE BRAINS THE GIFTS THE ADORABLE YOUTH
MR EASTERLY EYED HIM
WELL MR ALWYN SAID THE SENATOR HEARTILY YOU DELIVERED THE GOODS THANK YOU SIR
WELL HE WAS HAPPY
BLES STARTED IN ANGER THEN PAUSED IN SHIVERING DOUBT
BLES ALWYN THE FOOL--AND THE MAN
THE COTTON MANUFACTURERS COMBINE WAS ALL BUT A FACT
WHY HOW DO YOU DO ROBERT HOW DO YOU DO MISS SMITH WELL ARE YOU GETTING THINGS IN SHAPE SO AS TO ENTER SCHOOL EARLY NEXT YEAR ROBERT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
LOVE 128 FIFTEEN
HER OWN SILLY MISAPPREHENSION THE INFATUATION OF ALWYN FOR ZORA HER THOUGHTLESS--NO VINDICTIVE--BETRAYAL OF HIM TO SOMETHING WORSE THAN DEATH
PARIS SHE KNEW,--WONDERFUL HAUNTING PARIS
THE CROP IS EXCELLENT AND SMALL SCARCELY TEN MILLION BALES HE DECLARED
HARDLY ADVISABLE RETURNED DR BOLDISH SERIOUSLY IN OUR FRIEND'S PRESENCE,"--WITH A GLANCE TOWARD CRESSWELL
AND IF HE DOESN'T SHE LOOKED OFF ACROSS THE SWAMP AND WAS SILENT
BUT IN THIS WORLD NOT PERHAPS SO MUCH WITH HARRY AS WITH OTHERS OF HIS SET THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE GRAVELY INCLINED HEAD THE DEFERENTIAL SMILE AND CEREMONIOUS ACTION THE LIGHT CLEVER CONVERSE HAD SOUNDED STRANGELY HOLLOW ONCE OR TWICE WHEN SHE HAD ESSAYED TO SOUND THEM AND A CERTAIN FEAR TO LOOK AND SEE POSSESSED HER
YOU ARE A CRESSWELL EVEN IF YOU HAVE CAUGHT HARRY UP TO SOME OF HIS DEVILTRY,"--SHE STARTED,--"AND GOT MIFFED ABOUT IT
HE HASN'T DARED MISS SMITH WENT GENTLY ON
MAYBE SHE WAS RIDING THE DEVIL'S HORSE AND THESE WERE THE YAWNING GATES OF HELL BLACK AND SOMBRE BENEATH THE COLD DEAD RADIANCE OF THE MOON
WHY HAD HE NOT STOOD HIS GROUND
LAST NIGHT FOR THE SECOND TIME SHE HAD IRRITATED HIM
SHE LAUGHED A LOUD MIRTHLESS LAUGH THAT CAME POURING LIKE A SOB FROM HER DEEP LUNGS
SINCE SUFFICIENT LAND WAS CLEARED ALREADY FOR HIS PURPOSES AND MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WITH CONSTERNATION A HERD OF CATTLE GRAZING IN ONE FIELD ON SOME EARLY GREEN STUFF AND HEARD A DROVE OF HOGS IN THE SWAMP
SHE INTENDED GRADUALLY AND TACTFULLY TO RELIEVE HER HUSBAND OF CARE CONNECTED WITH HIS PUBLIC LIFE SO THAT BEFORE HE REALIZED IT SHE WOULD BE HIS GUIDING SPIRIT AND HIS INSPIRATION
HE THREW DOWN HIS PAPER AND THE HOT BLOOD SANG IN HIS EARS
THE SHERIFF RODE BY SCOWLING AND HUNTING FOR SOME POOR BLACK RUNAWAY WHEN HE SAW WHITE CHILDREN IN THE NEGRO SCHOOL AND WHITE WOMEN WHOM HE KNEW WERE MILL-HANDS LOOKING ON
TODD'S CIVIC CLUB IS RAISING THE MISCHIEF
YOU'VE GOT FOUR OTHER PRETTIER ONES--I COUNTED THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE YES IT DOES--FOLKS AIN'T GOT NO RIGHT TO THINGS THEY DON'T NEED THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ZORA AND YOU KNOW IT
WHAT DID HE CARE
OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE CAUGHT THE CURVE OF HER GOWN AND AS SHE SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HIM THE SUGGESTION OF A FAINT PERFUME
ONLY THIS LITTLE BABY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER FATHER YES I KNOW ONE LIKE THAT SHE SAID,--AND THEN SHE ADDED SOFTLY
OL MAN TOLLIVER WAS POWERFUL MAD WHY AUNT RACHEL IT'S SLAVERY CRIED THE LADY IN DISMAY
THEY'RE WORTH TEN DOLLARS--TAKE EM FOR A DOLLAR ZORA SAT STILL KEEPING HER EYES ON THE WINDOW
AT ANY RATE I HAVE LITTLE CHOICE
A LUXURY WHICH IN LATER YEARS THE ENDLESS PUSH OF DETAILS HAD DENIED HER
NO THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THEY HAVE LOST
YET SHE MUSED SHE WAS HERSELF TO BLAME
P'SH
HE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS I
SHE'S GIVING HERSELF TOO MANY DAMNED AIRS
SCHOOL WAS OUT BUT THE SUN WAS STILL HIGH AS BLES HURRIED FROM THE BARN UP THE BIG ROAD BESIDE THE SOFT SHADOWS OF THE SWAMP
LONG AND LOW THEY TALKED FAR INTO THE SOFT SOUTHERN NIGHT
THEN SHE ATTRIBUTED IT TO HER SEX
I DECLARE
YOU WONDER-WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED SOFTLY
HOW DO MISS ZORA--MR ALWYN I SURE IS GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR
TOLLIVER WAS SUSPICIOUS AND MOVED TO DELAY MATTERS
CATCHING HIMSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN ON THE POINT OF SPEAKING TO HER AND URGING YET EVER AGAIN HOLDING HIMSELF BACK AND BOWING IN SILENT RESPECT TO THE DIGNITY OF HER LIFE
BUT ZORA EYED HER CALMLY WITH SOMETHING LIKE DISDAIN
FOR YONDER WHERE THE BLACK EARTH OF THE SWAMP HEAVED IN A FORMLESS MOUND SHE FELT THE BLACK ARMS OF ELSPETH RISING FROM THE SOD--GIGANTIC MIGHTY
AND THEN TIMIDLY
TIGHTENING UP ON THE TENANTS ASKED TAYLOR
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT IS HAPPENING YOU MUST KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO KNOW WHAT MAY HAPPEN SAID MRS VANDERPOOL
I HARDLY KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO MENTION IT BUT YOUR SCHOOL THIS CHARMING YOUNG LADY DISARMED HIS TRUCULENT SPIRIT AND THE USUALLY COLLECTED AND DETERMINED YOUNG MAN WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO PROCEED
OUTSIDE THE DOOR CAME VOICES--THE DRESSMAKER'S TONES HELEN'S SOFT DRAWL AND MRS VANDERPOOL'S FINISHED ACCENTS
IT WAS AN OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE SMITH SCHOOL OF A LEGACY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TOGETHER WITH THE CRESSWELL HOUSE AND PLANTATION
SLOWLY THE BLOOD CREPT OUT OF HIS WHITE FACE LEAVING IT WHITER AND WENT SURGING AND POUNDING IN HIS HEART
SHE HAD CHOSEN HER MULE LONG BEFORE--A BIG BLACK BEAST SNORTING OVER HIS PILE OF CORN,--AND GLIDING UP TO HIM SHE GATHERED HIS SUPPER INTO HER SKIRT FOUND A STOUT HALTER AND FED HIM SPARINGLY AS HE FOLLOWED HER
THE COLONEL COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS
TO SEE ALL THAT TIMBER AND PRIME COTTON-LAND GOING TO WASTE
DO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE I COULD MOULD HER INTO A LADY IF SHE WERE NOT BLACK MARY CRESSWELL LAUGHED
YES SHE ACKNOWLEDGED POLITELY FEW OF US CAN AFFORD MAIDS AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT USUALLY ARRANGE FOR THEM
GIVE UP YOUR PLEASURES
IT WAS A RISK BUT THE RETURNS WOULD BE ENORMOUS--SHE MUST DO IT
SEARCHING DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF HER TRUNK SHE DREW FORTH THAT FILMY CLOUD OF WHITE--SILK-BORDERED AND HALF FINISHED TO A GOWN
YOU MUST HAVE NEIGHBORS
AS THE TWO WHITE RIDERS APPROACHED THE BUGGY ONE SAID TO THE OTHER
UP AND DOWN THEY PASSED TO AND FRO LOOKING AND GLIDING LIKE SHEETED GHOSTS
SHE WOULD NOT FALL INTO THE PIT OPENING BEFORE HER
FEW NOTICED THE CHANGE MUCH
FOR HER TO CONCLUDE TO TREAT BLES ALWYN AS A MAN DESPITE HIS COLOR WAS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS TO THINK MR CRESSWELL A CRIMINAL
WHY--WHY EVERY CHANCE SHE PROTESTED AND WHERE THERE'S NONE MAKE A CHANCE MISS TAYLOR SAYS"--MISS SMITH'S HEART SANK
THIRTY-EIGHT ATONEMENT THREE MONTHS HAD FLOWN
WHO THE BLACK MAN WHOSE WOOLLY HEAD IS FILLED WITH IDEAS OF RISING
I THINK I WANT TO TRY A COLORED MAID SHE TOLD THE CRESSWELLS LAUGHINGLY AS THEY DROVE HOME
SHE WORKED OVER IT FAITHFULLY AND LOVINGLY IN EVERY SPARE HOUR AND IN LONG NIGHTS OF DREAMING
NOW I DON'T KNOW THE YOUNG MAN MIND YOU SAID THE SENATOR
NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILLION
WANDERING NEGROES AND EVEN WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST DEPTHS--AND MALARIA--SEE YOU TREMBLE NOW BUT NOT FROM MALARIA SHE SLOWLY RETURNED
FORGET YOURSELVES AND YOUR PETTY WANTS AND BEHOLD YOUR STARVING PEOPLE
BUT SHE STOOD A PATHETIC FIGURE FADED WORN YET WITH UNMISTAKABLE TRACES OF BEAUTY IN HER GOLDEN FACE AND SOFT BROWN HAIR
SHE DID NOT REPLY
BUT AT THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION SHE MUST CRUSH HIM RUTHLESSLY AND AT THE SAME TIME POINT THE PATH OF DUTY
IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY AND YET HE PERSISTED IF I WERE SURE OF ITS SOURCE I WOULD KNOW MY GROUND BETTER AND--MY OBLIGATION TO YOU WOULD BE GREATER SHE LAUGHED AND GLANCED TOWARD ALWYN
SUCH EMPTINESS OF LIFE AND AIM HAD TO BE FILLED AND IT WAS FILLED
WILL YOU--MARRY ME BLES L'ENVOI LEND ME THINE EARS O GOD THE READER WHOSE FATHERS AFORETIME SENT MINE DOWN INTO THE LAND OF EGYPT INTO THIS HOUSE OF BONDAGE
CAN'T LET YOU HAVE ANY TILL WE SEE HOW YOUR COTTON COMES OUT I JUST WANTED A BIT
THEY MUST BE CRUSHED AND CRUSHED QUICKLY
HOW LARGE IS YOUR PLACE ABOUT TWENTY ACRES AND WHAT WERE YOU TO PAY FOR IT FOUR HUNDRED HAVE YOU GOT THE DEED YES'M BUT I AIN'T FINISHED PAYING YET
THE WINTER STARTED IN SEVERELY AND IT WAS EASY TO FILL TWO PRIVATE CARS WITH MEMBERS OF THE NEW NEGRO EDUCATION BOARD RIGHT AFTER THANKSGIVING
TOWARD DARK SHE WALKED SLOWLY OUT THE GATE AND UP THE HIGHWAY TOWARD THE CRESSWELL OAKS
TAYLOR ON THE OTHER HAND HAD A HORROR OF A LIE NEVER DRANK NOR PLAYED GAMES OF CHANCE BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS SPECULATION AND IN THE BUSINESS GAME HE WAS UTTERLY RUTHLESS AND RESPECTED NO ONE
A VISION TO HIM OF DARK AND PLEADING EYES THAT HE CONSTANTLY SAW BESIDE HER COOL KEEN GLANCE
WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE AND TRAINING AND SOME CAPITAL IT IS THE WILDEST NONSENSE TO THINK YOU CAN LEAD YOUR PEOPLE OUT OF SLAVERY
A LITTLE MOCKING SMILE CAME AND SAT UPON HER LIPS
THE SENTIMENT OF JOINING WITH THE NEGROES DID NOT SEEM TO AROUSE THE BITTER RESENTMENT HE EXPECTED
THEN SHE BEGAN TO EXCUSE
HER GOWN WAS TOO HANDSOME HER GLOVES TOO SPOTLESS HER AIR HAD HAUTEUR ENOUGH TO BE ALMOST IMPUDENT IN THE OPINION OF MOST WHITE PEOPLE
AN OLD CHIMNEY LEANED DRUNKENLY AGAINST IT RAGING WITH FIRE AND SMOKE WHILE THROUGH THE CHINKS WINKED RED GLEAMS OF WARMTH AND WILD CHEER
IT WAS ONE THING FOR HER TO BE A TACTFUL HOSTESS PLEASING HER HUSBAND AND HIS GUESTS
WITHOUT A WORD HE TOOK IT AND AGAIN HIS HANDS FLEW HEAVENWARD
THEN SUDDENLY A PANIC SEIZED HER
AH THAT SPLENDID STRENGTH OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD--IF ONLY SHE HERSELF HAD IT
THE QUESTIONS THE DOUBTS THE UNCERTAINTY WITHIN HIM WERE CLAMORING FOR UTTERANCE
THEY DON'T WANT TRUTH OR PROGRESS
I'VE GAMBLED ON CARDS AND ON HORSES
THE MURDERERS
AND WHY DO YOU HATE IT YES--YOU'LL BE NEAR SHE ADMITTED
OUT OF THE NIGHT CAME VOICES AND LAUGHTER AND THE SOUND OF WHEELS AND GALLOPING HORSES
HE SEEMED SOMEHOW A PART OF THE FEW THINGS IN THE WORLD--LITTLE AND UNIMPORTANT PERHAPS--THAT COUNTED AND STOOD FIRM AND SHE SHOOK HIS HAND CORDIALLY NOT MINDING THE STARING OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT
SHE HELD UP HER TICKET AND HE SNATCHED IT FROM HER MUTTERING SOME DIRECTION
A FEW PICTURES WERE ON THE WALLS--A MADONNA A SCENE OF MAD CAREERING HORSES AND SOME SAD BABY FACES
BUT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PICK A NEW MAN
WHAT DOES DE GOOD BOOK SAY
IT WAS A FACE SHE DID NOT KNOW
AND SO BARE SO BITTER BARE
I DON'T WORK
IN VAIN DID HE TRY TO STUDY THE MATTER THROUGH
TAYLOR LOOKED AT THE PAPER BLANKLY AND THEN AT CRESSWELL AND SOME INKLING OF THE IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO NATURES LEAPT IN BOTH THEIR HEARTS
MASTER GIMME A CHRISTMAS GIFT THE LORDS OF THE SOIL STOOD ROUND GAUGING THEIR COTTON MEASURING THEIR MEN
I FORGOT IT SIS
HE THANKED HER CORDIALLY AND HURRIED TOWARD THE DINING-HALL MEETING COLONEL CRESSWELL ON HORSEBACK JUST AS HE TURNED INTO THE SCHOOL GATE
HE TOO HAD MADE MILLIONS--NOT AS MANY AS GREY BUT A FEW
ASK MISS HELEN TO COME DOWN SAID MR CRESSWELL
SO HE BEGAN TO DROP IN AT HIS LODGINGS AND TONIGHT INVITED HIM TO THE BETHEL LITERARY
HUSH MISS WYNN COMMANDED AND THEY JOINED THE GROUP ABOUT THE PIANO
THEY TRAMPED INSOLENTLY THROUGH THE SCHOOL GROUNDS BUT THERE WAS NO SHRED OF EVIDENCE UNTIL THEY CAME TO ROB'S CABIN AND FOUND HIS GUN
THIS VERY NIGHT BEFORE THE MORNING PAPERS CAME OUT SHE MUST EXPLAIN
THE RIGHT SORT OF NEGRO--ONE LIKE STILLINGS--APPOINTED TO A REASONABLE POSITION WOULD DO BOTH OPINED CRESSWELL
WHAT DOES MISS WYNN DO FOR A LIVING THE GIRL TITTERED
THE SHERIFF WAS ANGRY AND MISTRUSTFUL
BUT MOST OF THE TOWN CRIED JOYFULLY IT'S THE NEW COTTON-MILL JOHN TAYLOR'S HEAD TEEMED WITH NEW SCHEMES
THE CONNECTION OF COTTON-RAISING AND ITS RAW MATERIAL IS TOO CLOSE TO RISK A MANUFACTURING TRUST THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE PRACTICAL CONTROL OF THE RAW MATERIAL
WE WANT TO CENTRE HERE AGENCIES TO MAKE LIFE BETTER
A FEW MINUTES LATER SHE WENT TO HER DESK AND SAT THERE SO LONG THAT SHE STARTED AT HEARING THE CLOCK STRIKE NINE
PERSONALLY SHE WAS INCLINED TO SPEND HER MONEY IN BETTERING THE WORLD RIGHT OFF IN SUCH WAYS AS MIGHT FROM TIME TO TIME SEEM ATTRACTIVE
BUT HER REPLY WAS UTTERED UNHESITANTLY
THEN WITH CREAKING AND STRAINING OF WAGONS FOUR GREAT BLACK MULES DASHED INTO SIGHT WITH TWELVE BURSTING BALES OF YELLOWISH COTTON LOOMING AND SWAYING BEHIND
BUT AS YET SHE WAS STILL A GIRL WITH A NEW SHYNESS AND COMELINESS AND A BOLD SEARCHING HEART
AT LAST HE AROSE
THE MASSES AND WORK IS THE TRUTH ONE MUST FACE AND CULTURE AND WORK QUITE INCOMPATIBLE I ASSURE YOU MY DEAR SHE STRETCHED HER SILKEN LIMBS LAZILY WHILE MISS TAYLOR SAT SILENTLY STARING AT THE WATERS
OR IF SHE HAD SPOKEN ZORA'S EARS HAD NOT BEEN TUNED TO UNDERSTAND
HARRY SHE TRIED TO SAY AS HE LOOKED UP
I'VE BEEN FIRED AND I'M DAMNED GLAD OF IT
HE TAKES HER HOME FROM THE TREBLE CLEF
STRUGGLING BLINDLY GROPING IN HALF FORMED PLANS FOR A WAY
I'M A WHITE MAN AND I PLACE THE LOWEST WHITE MAN EVER CREATED ABOVE THE HIGHEST DARKEY EVER THOUGHT OF
IF YOU CAN PROVE TO US THAT CONDITIONS ARE AS YOU SAY WE'RE IN FOR IT GOOD
THEN SHE REMEMBERED
YOU KNOW I HAVE A SALARY NOW HE PRODUCED A RING WITH A SMALL DIAMOND CLUSTER
AND OF THE MIGHTY CRESSWELLS WHOM MISS SMITH SO EVIDENTLY DISLIKED
I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE SAID
DON'T BE ANGRY
SAID HARRY
STRANGERS GREETED HIM FAMILIARLY ON THE STREET
COME--EAT SHE CRIED
BUT--WELL YOU KNOW CARRIE WYNN BETTER THAN I DO
WHOSE WORK IS THIS SENATOR SHE ASKED
HIS SISTER INSTALLED ONCE AGAIN FOR A FEW DAYS IN HER OLD ROOM AT THE SCHOOL UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS CONFERRING ABOUT EMMA'S LEGACY AND SHE WAS GLAD
LOOK AT THIS COTTON HE EJACULATED
COLONEL I'VE GOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE DID NOT MENTION THE OTHER NINE
SHE DECIDED THAT SILK EMBROIDERY MUST EMBELLISH THE SKIRT
I'SE CALLED
SHE FELT AGAIN THE OLD MOTHERLY INSTINCT TO BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME THE NEW PUPIL
SHE FELT THAT IN SOME WAY SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DREADFUL SITUATION AND SHE WANTED DESPERATELY TO SAVE MATTERS FROM FINAL DISASTER
IT SITS AND LISTENS TO THE NIGHT BUT EVEN AS SHE NESTLED TO HIM HAPPILY THERE CAME THE HARSH THUNDER OF HORSES HOOFS BEATING ON THEIR EARS
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
HE MUST APPRECIATE HER EFFORTS
BUT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HER INCLINATIONS LAY WAS QUITE CLEAR TO HIM
THEN SHE TOLD SOMETHING OF WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND READ OF THE WORLD'S NEWER WAYS OF HELPING MEN AND WOMEN
THERE'S BUT ONE WAY TO BREAK IT AND THAT'S TO ALLEGE MISUNDERSTANDING ON YOUR PART CRESSWELL WINCED
HE BELONGED IN HIS MIND TO THAT YOUNGER CLASS OF HALF-EDUCATED BLACKS WHO WERE IMPUDENT AND DISRESPECTFUL TOWARD THEIR SUPERIORS NOT EVEN TOUCHING HIS HAT WHEN HE MET A WHITE MAN
MRS CRESSWELL WAS ENTHUSIASTIC AND VOLUBLE FOR THE BIT OF SCULPTURE AND IT FINALLY WON THE VOTE FOR THE FIRST PRIZE
HE FELT HIMSELF HOAXED AND CHEATED AND HE MEANT TO HAVE HIS REVENGE
NOT SINCE THE WAR HAD A PROMINENT SOUTHERNER REPRESENTED AMERICA AT A FIRST-CLASS FOREIGN COURT
BUT NOW THAT THEY WERE SETTLED IN WASHINGTON THE ELECTION OVER AND CONGRESS IN SESSION IT REALLY SEEMED TIME FOR WORK AND LIFE TO BEGIN IN DEAD EARNEST AND NEW ENGLAND MARY WAS DREAMING MIGHTY DREAMS AND GOLDEN FUTURES
HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING AT THE LITTLE LETTER
SHE WAS AFRAID OF HERSELF
HER CHEEKS WERE MORE BRILLIANT FOR SHE HAD TOUCHED THEM WITH ROUGE
THE DAYS FLEW BY AND THE MOON DARKENED
THE SCHOOL WENT ON
THE DYING OF THE DAY SOOTHED THEM ALL INSENSIBLY
HE WAS RISING HE WAS MAKING VALUABLE SPEECHES HE WAS BECOMING A SOCIAL POWER AND HIS ONLY HANDICAP WAS HIS PLAIN AND OVER-AMBITIOUS WIFE
DO YOU KNOW NO ONE IN TOWN ONE OR TWO OF MY FELLOW CLERKS AND MR STILLINGS
BLES SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY SHALL I TELL YOU OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE HE GLANCED AT HER AGAIN
AND YET AS HE DREW NEAR HUGE HANDS HELD HIM BACK AND HEAVY WEIGHTS CLOGGED HIS FEET
SHE IDLY FINGERED A NEW BOOK ON THE TABLE AND THEN PUT IT DOWN SHARPLY
YES THEY IS
I THINK SO TOO ZORA AGREED
WILL YOU COME TO HEAR ME HE ASKED
ZORA SAID NOTHING BUT GLIDED IN AND STOOD IN THE SHADOWS
REMEMBER THAT WE GET AFTER ALL LITTLE EDUCATION FROM BOOKS
THE WAIL OF BLACK MILLIONS SWEEPS THE AIR--EAST AND WEST THEY CRY HELP
SHE THOUGHT OF MR AND MRS TODD AND THE OLD DREAM GLOWED FAINTLY AGAIN
OF COURSE MRS VANDERPOOL WE'LL PROBABLY WIN
THE MATTER UNDER DISCUSSION WAS THE COTTON-GOODS SCHEDULE OF THE NEW TARIFF BILL ABOUT WHICH REALLY HE KNEW A LITTLE
THIS MAN EVIDENTLY HAD INSIDE INFORMATION
EVEN GOT A NORTHERN WALK--I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT SHE WAS A LADY NEITHER OF THE GENTLEMEN EVER DREAMED HOW LONG HOW HARD HOW HEART-WRINGING WAS THAT WALK FROM THE GATE UP THE WINDING WAY BENEATH THEIR CARELESS GAZE
IT'S ROB AND JOHNSON
CASE POSTPONED SAID THE COURT
WHO'S A-FEARED OF THE DARK
TO THE NEGROES HE WAS A WHITE FOLK'S NIGGER TO BE DESPISED AND FEARED
OF COURSE I KNOW HE'S A NEGRO
WHAT IS THE WORLD LIKE ASKED ZORA
SUCH APPARITIONS WERE FEW ABOUT THE COUNTRY LANDS
THE SINGING STOPPED BUT HE CAME STRAIGHT ON TILL HE REACHED ZORA'S SIDE AND THEN HE WHIRLED AND SPOKE
YES MA'AM ARE YOU GOING BACK THERE WHEN YOU FINISH I DON'T KNOW I THINK YOU OUGHT TO--AND WORK FOR YOUR PEOPLE YES MA'AM SHE STOPPED PUZZLED AND LOOKED ABOUT
THEN IN SHEER WEARINESS THE ANGER DIED WITHIN HIS SOUL LEAVING BUT ASHES AND DESPAIR
ABOVE HER SAILED THE SAME GREAT STARS
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT BUT POSSIBLE
DAT WAS COTTON YOU KNOW THE CRESSWELLS THEN KNOW DEM
MISS SMITH SOON BEGAN TO LOOK ON THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME UNEASINESS
QUICK
I'SE SEEN EM I'SE HEARD EM CAUSE MY MAMMY IS A WITCH THE BOY WOULD SIT AND WATCH HER WONDERINGLY AS SHE LAY CURLED ALONG THE LOW BRANCH OF THE MIGHTY OAK CLINGING WITH LITTLE CURVED LIMBS AND FLYING FINGERS
I REALLY DON'T KNOW SHE PRESENTLY CONFESSED
THINK THIS OVER
THE RESULT WAS THAT WHILE MRS CRESSWELL WAS GIVING LARGE AND BRILLIANT PARTIES TO THE WHOLE SOUTHERN CONTINGENT MRS VANDERPOOL WAS ENGINEERING EXCLUSIVE DINNERS WHERE OLD NEW YORK MET STATELY CHARLESTON AND GOSSIPED INTERESTINGLY
AT FIRST IN SHEER EXHAUSTION PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SHE LAY AND MOANED
I'M GOING TO MENTION FRANCE AT THE SAME TIME MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED AND LEANED BACK IN HER CARRIAGE
THE CRESSWELLS I THINK
HAD IT BEEN REAL
LOOK AT THAT HE SAID FINALLY
WHY DID YOU SEND YOUR EXHIBIT WHEN YOU KNEW IT WAS NOT WANTED BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO WE DID NOT ASK FOR COLORED PEOPLE YOU ASKED ALL SOUTHERN-BORN PERSONS
AT NOON BLES WOULD RUN DOWN AND THEY WOULD LINGER UNTIL HE MUST HURRY BACK TO DINNER
IN THE SILENCE MISS SMITH CONTINUED
THEN GREY STOPPED
AND THEN TOO I BELIEVE THERE IS TALK OF ABOLISHING THE SCHOOL-BOARD AND CONCENTRATING POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT PRECISELY SAID MISS WYNN
SHE ROSE ABRUPTLY TO HER FEET AND HE STARTED UP
SHE SAW HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF BLACK MEN AND WOMEN
MEN STOPPED SPENDING BUSINESS GREW DULL AND MILLIONS OF EYES WERE GLUED TO THE BLACKBOARDS OF THE COTTON-EXCHANGE
NO SIR
SHE WAS IN DREAMLAND
SILENT FOOTSTEPS CREPT HITHER AND YONDER
FOR A LONG TIME SHE STOOD QUIETLY LOOKING IN
FROM AFAR THERE SEEMED TO COME THE ECHO OR THE ANSWER TO THE CALL
DON'T BE ALARMED
SHE ENTERED A SIDE DOOR AND LISTENED
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT HE SAID
HAVE YOU BEEN IN YOUR SITTING-ROOM AND THEN NOT WAITING FOR A REPLY HE STRODE TO THE DOOR
OR WAS HE HAPPY
THE GAUNT SPEAKER TURNED AGAIN TO THE PEOPLE
HIS WIFE PLACED EVERY TEMPTATION TO KNOWLEDGE BEFORE HIM EVEN INSPIRING SENATOR SMITH TO ASK HIM TO DEFEND THAT SCHEDULE AGAINST THE LOW-TARIFF ADVOCATE
THIRTY-SEVEN THE MOB WHEN EMMA BERTIE'S CHILD CAME HOME AFTER A TWO YEARS COURSE OF STUDY SHE HAD PASSED FROM GIRLHOOD TO YOUNG WOMANHOOD
A HEAVY MASS OF HAIR CLUNG MOTIONLESS TO HER WIDE FOREHEAD
ALL THIS SHE SOON FORGOT UNDER THE CADENCE OF HARRY CRESSWELL'S PLEASANT VOICE AND THE CARESSING TOUCH OF HIS ARM
ZORA LOOKED LONG AND SEARCHINGLY
THE WATERS YAWNED MURKILY BELOW
FOLLOW ME HE SHOUTED
CRESSWELL ON THE ONE HAND WITH HIS USUAL SELFISHNESS TOOK HIS RISING POPULARITY AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND AS THE FRUITS OF HIS OWN WORK
HE CLOSED HIS EYES A SPACE AND THEN OPENED THEM
THE AWAKENED CHILD SAT UP AND STARED WITH WIDE BLUE EYES
WHERE AND WHAT MARK IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
MARY WAS PUZZLED
HER FACE WAS PALE AND DRAWN AND THERE WERE LITTLE WRINKLES BELOW HER SUNKEN EYES
DISTINCT DIRECT
THEN SHE TURNED
BOTH WERE IN THE MIDST OF THAT MIGHTY CHANGE FROM YOUTH TO WOMANHOOD AND MANHOOD
YES HE CRIED PRAY SAM COLLINS YOU BLACK DEVIL
MISS SMITH CONTEMPLATED HER SADLY
HE SAT UP WITH A START
HE OPENED HER BOUDOIR DOOR GENTLY AND SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM RADIANT CLOTHED IN SILK AND LACE HER HAIR LOOSENED
SUMDRICH IS CHAIRMAN BY COURTESY BUT YOU'LL HAVE THE REAL POWER
I SUPPOSE YOU HEAR FROM THE SCHOOL HE VENTURED AFTER A PAUSE
THE YOUNG MAN LAUGHED AWKWARDLY AND STROLLED AWAY
YOU WERE BORN IN ICE SHE RETORTED ADDING A BIT MORE TENDERLY IN CLEAR STRONG ICE
I'LL LOOK HIM OVER AND SEE IF HE'S WORTH ZORA--WHICH I GREATLY DOUBT MRS CRESSWELL PURSED HER LIPS AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT
ALL THIS SHE WAS THINKING AND WEAVING
TO BE SURE SHE KNEW NO PEOPLE BUT MRS VANDERPOOL KNEW ENOUGH TO EVEN THINGS
SIX SAID THE WHEEL--HIS FINGER QUIVERED--"AND A HALF HELL YELLED TAYLOR
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE HEAVENS CHILD
HOW HE HAD DECIDED TO GO BACK SOUTH HE DID NOT KNOW
I GUESS TYLOR HAS BEEN PAID OFF SAID BLES BUT MISS TAYLOR WAS TOO DISGUSTED TO ANSWER
AND OF ALL PEOPLE ROBERT YOUR PEOPLE NEED TRAINED INTELLIGENCE TO COPE WITH THIS PROBLEM OF FARMING HERE
WHAT COULD BE WORSE THAN DEATH
THE SOUTH WAS GETTING DARKER AND DARKER
NO NO--NO CARRIAGE
HE MET HER WITH TENDER SOLICITUDE AND SHE WAS GLAD TO FEEL HIS ARM BENEATH HERS
AND IF YOU LEARN READ IT SHE COMMANDED
THEN SHE SAID DELIBERATELY
HE HAD CHOSEN THE RIGHT--BUT THE RIGHT WAS INEFFECTIVE IMPOTENT ALMOST LUDICROUS
I CANNOT SUPPORT YOU IN IDLENESS YOU KNOW YES MASTER HARRY THE OTHER RETURNED WITH CONCILIATORY EAGERNESS
HELLO ELISE GROWLED ONE BIG BLUE-COAT
SHE OPENED THE BACK DOOR AND LED THE OLD WOMAN TO THE OFFICE
THE SALARY WAS MEAGRE AND THE WORK HARD
THE COTTON NOW GROWING WAS PERHAPS NOT SO UNIFORMLY FINE AS THE FIRST ACRE OF SILVER FLEECE BUT IT WAS OF UNUSUAL HEIGHT AND THICKNESS
HOW MUCH--FARTHER WILL IT DROP HE ASKED HARSHLY
OFTEN SHE FELL SUPPERLESS TO SLEEP WITH TWO GREAT TEARS CREEPING DOWN HER TIRED CHEEKS
GIT THE GROUND--GIT THE GROUND
NOW HE ABRUPTLY SHOT A GLANCE AT CRESSWELL
HER SERVANTS LIKED HER AND THE TENANTS COULD COUNT ON HER SPASMODIC ATTENTIONS IN TIME OF SICKNESS AND TROUBLE
NIGGER LABOR IS TOO WORTHLESS OH
HE WAS ALMOST CROUCHING FOR A SPRING AND NO SOONER HAD THE SPEAKER WITH A REALLY FINE APOSTROPHE TO INDEPENDENCE AND REASON IN VOTING SAT DOWN THAN BLES WAS ON HIS FEET WALKING FORWARD
YOU'RE CRAZY BUT TAYLOR SMILED A SLOW THIN SMILE AND PUT AWAY HIS PAPERS
ZORA YES
THE CRY OF THE NAKED WAS SWEEPING THE WORLD AND YONDER IN THE NIGHT BLACK MEN WERE ANSWERING THE CALL
BUT AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THEY RODE ON LEAVING THE KIND FACE AGAIN BEAMING AND DIMPLING
I'VE BEEN LOOKING UP THINGS AND THERE ARE THREE POINTS YOU'D BETTER STUDY
COME TO THE DRESSMAKER I'M DYING TO TRY THIS ON--NOW
THEY WERE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT CANDY AND FLOWERS BUT THOUGHTLESS ABOUT FEELINGS AND INCOME
BUT IF THE GENERAL PLEASURE WAS OWING TO ANY ONE PERSON PARTICULARLY IT WAS TO MR HARRY CRESSWELL
THOSE ARE NOT GREAT ENOUGH FOR MR ALWYN
BUT BLES STRUCK BY A THOUGHT PAUSED
WITH A NOD A HALF-FORMED WORD A COMMENT BEGUN WHICH SHE FINISHED BLES FROWNED
DID YOU NOTICE HOW UNHEALTHY THE CHILDREN LOOKED
THEN MISS SMITH SAID SLOWLY
A MOMENT THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER
ONE DESPERATE STRUGGLE A WHIRL OF BLOOD AND THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD RISE TO CRUSH HIM AND HIS PEOPLE
AND SHE SAW TOO THE WHITE MAN
SHE RUSHED INTO HER DRESSING-ROOM AND CALLED HER MAID
MR BOCOMBE GROPED WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION TO FIND THE POCKET FOR HIS NOTE-BOOK
BUT THERE WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH BUSINESS IN THE ARRANGEMENT TO SUIT THE COLONEL
HE HAD BEEN LAUGHING INCONTINENTLY
MRS CRESSWELL WAS MORE UNSATISFIED THAN USUAL
ARE YOU WILLING TO TRY WHY YES SIR
THEY VISIT SENATOR SMITH'S TOGETHER
BY SUBTLE TEMPTINGS SHE GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT PLENTY LAY BEYOND THE DARK WATERS AND QUICKLY SWINGING HERSELF TO HIS BACK SHE STARTED TO RIDE HIM UP AND DOWN ALONG THE EDGE OF THE LAGOON PETTING AND WHISPERING TO HIM OF GOOD THINGS BEYOND
IT WAS NOT A SONG AT ALL PERHAPS BUT A CONFUSED WHIZZING AND MURMURING AS OF A THOUSAND ILL-TUNED BUSY VOICES
AT FIRST IT SEEMED ACCIDENTAL THE LUCK OF LIFE
SHE ALWAYS ROUSED HOSTILITY AS SHE ENTERED
IT WAS SHAMEFUL
HE GLARED AT HER
PARTLY WITH ITS USUAL HEARTLESSNESS PARTLY WITH THAT CYNICAL AND DEADENING RESERVE FUND WHICH IT HAS TODAY FOR ITS DARKER PEOPLES
ALWYN HAD BEEN CUT TO THE QUICK AND HIS REPLY WAS A STRAIGHT OUT DEFENCE OF NEGRO RIGHTS AND A CALL TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO REDEEM ITS PLEDGES
THERE WERE NO LITTLE FLASHES OF ANGER NOW NO POUTINGS NOR SWEET RECONCILIATIONS
THE LAND IS WORTH YOU KNOW AT LEAST FIFTY DOLLARS AN ACRE NOT MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS I FEAR WHY YOU WANTED SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR POORER LAND LAST YEAR
BUT I'LL LEARN TO READ AND JUST SEE IT WILL BE HARD WORK HE WARNED
NOT THE GREAT HAPPINESS--THAT WAS GONE FOREVER--BUT ILLUMINATION ATONEMENT AND SOMETHING OF THE POWER AND THE GLORY
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU DO HE ASKED
THERE'S GOING TO BE RACING OUT AT THE PARK THIS EVENING SAID HARRY
THE OFFICE WORK WENT ON METHODICALLY
WITH YOUR FINE VOICE AND TALENT FOR DRAWING A DOGGED LOOK SETTLED ON ROBERT'S YOUNG BRIGHT FACE AND THE SPEAKER PAUSED
HE WANTED INFORMATION VERY DEFINITE INFORMATION ABOUT TOOMS COUNTY COTTON
IT WAS A PROPOSAL A LITTLE TOO DARING FOR THEM A BIT TOO FAR BEYOND THEIR EXPERIENCE
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS RIGHT
AT ANY RATE CULTURE AND THIS WORK WERE
HE WROTE THE CRESSWELLS TENTATIVELY EXPECTING NO REPLY OR AN EVASIVE ONE
BUT ON BLES AS HE RAISED THE BUGGY TOP IT FELT HOT AND FIERY
AND WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A LOW MOAN OF PAIN
HE DID NOT PUT THIS IN WORDS TO MRS GREY--HE WAS ONLY HEAD CLERK IN HER LATE HUSBAND'S OFFICE--BUT HE BECAME WATCHFUL AND THOUGHTFUL
YOU DAMNED SCOUNDREL THE JUDGE RAPPED FOR ORDER AND FIDGETED IN HIS SEAT
YOU COME AGAIN NEXT SATURDAY THEN SADLY SHE WATCHED THE RAGGED OLD SLAVE HOBBLE AWAY WITH HIS CHERISHED PAPERS HE GREETED THE YOUNG MAN AT THE GATE AND PASSED OUT WHILE THE LATTER WALKED BRISKLY UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED
HE HAD TO RESPECT JOHN TAYLOR'S UNDOUBTED ABILITY
THAT'S VOTED BAD FORM
IN DUMB DESPAIR HE DROPPED BESIDE HER AND GATHERED HER IN HIS ARMS
NOT RIGHT OFF SHE SAID GENTLY
ONE SAW IT EASILY ALMOST SUDDENLY IN ALWYN'S SUNDAY SUIT VIVID NECKTIES AND AWKWARD FADS
MRS GREY WAS HORRIFIED
THERE WAS AN UNMISTAKABLE NOTE OF ENTHUSIASM IN HER VOICE
GEORGIA IS A LARGE STATE,"--TENTATIVELY
WHO'S THAT I DON'T KNOW--IT'S A GIRL--I HE GRIPPED HER TILL SHE WINCED
AT LAST THEY CAME TO WHAT SEEMED THE END
MY FRIENDS RAVE--REALLY I'M THE MOST BLESSED OF WOMEN
THERE WAS NO FLINCHING OF HER SPIRIT
SHE SAUNTERED OVER TO HER FATHER KISSED HIM AND HUNG OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR
THE GOOD OF OTHERS IS OUR TRUE GOOD
IT'S THE CRESSWELLS WE WANT WELL MARY WAS VERY DUBIOUS THEY ARE--THE MOST IMPORTANT SEVEN THE PLACE OF DREAMS WHEN SHE WENT SOUTH LATE IN SEPTEMBER MARY TAYLOR HAD TWO DEFINITE BUT ALLIED OBJECTS
BUT COULDN'T YOU HIRE SOME GOOD WORKERS NIGGERS WON'T WORK
ALL THAT DARK EARTH HEAVED IN MIGHTY TRAVAIL WITH THE BURSTING BOLLS OF THE COTTON WHILE BLACK ATTENDANT EARTH SPIRITS SWARMED ABOVE SWEATING AND CROONING TO ITS BIRTH PAINS
MISS SMITH SUGGESTED A DRIVE TO TOWN--BLES COULD TAKE HER IN THE TOP-BUGGY AFTER SCHOOL--AND SHE COULD CONSULT SOME OF THE MERCHANTS AND BUSINESS MEN
WITH A LOW AND FEARFUL MOAN THE OLD WOMAN LURCHED SIDEWAYS THEN CRASHED LIKE A FALLEN PINE UPON THE HEARTHSTONE
YOU WILL MARRY THIS MAN--BUT HEAVEN HELP YOU IF YOU DO SO IT WAS THAT ON THIS DAY WHEN SHE SOMEHOW FELT HE WOULD SPEAK HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS FILLED HER WITH SUDDEN PANIC
THE LAGOON LAY THERE BEFORE HER PRESENTLY GLEAMING IN THE DARKNESS--COLD AND STILL AND IN IT SWAM AN AWFUL SHAPE
YET THE IMPOSING BUILDING DID NOT LOOK SORDID
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN SHE SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE STORY HAD SUNK DEEPLY
HE WAS WORTH WATCHING SHE CONCLUDED
OF COURSE IT ISN'T--I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FARMING
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH PEOPLE
THE KNOWLEDGE MADE HIM SUSPICIOUS
AND NOW TODAY SHE LAY REPEATING THEM MECHANICALLY GRASPING VAGUELY AT THEIR MEANING
HE WAS CHEWING AN ENORMOUS QUID OF TOBACCO THE JUICE OF WHICH HE DISTRIBUTED GENEROUSLY AND HAD HAD JUST LIQUOR ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM JOLLY
IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO THIS DAY SHE RECALLED SINCE SHE FIRST CAME TO THIS BROAD LAND OF SHADE AND SHINE IN ALABAMA TO TEACH BLACK FOLKS
SHE AWOKE IN WASHINGTON TO NEW FAIRYLANDS AND WONDERS
THERE SEEMS TO BE MARRYING AND GIVING IN MARRIAGE LAUGHED MRS VANDERPOOL
YOU FAILED PURSUED JOHN TAYLOR BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET THE BANKS AND THE BIG MERCHANTS BEHIND YOU
TODAY BOTH MET EACH OTHER ALMOST EAGERLY
THEN I'LL GO TO CRESSWELL AND SAY DANGEROUS NIGGER JUST AS I TOLD YOU HE'LL BEGIN TO MOVE THINGS
SHE POINTED IMPRESSIVELY ROOFWARD
IT'S MORE THAN HE'S DONE FOR ME THIS THREE-MONTH
WHEN HE DID APPROACH A GROUP AND LISTEN THEY SEEMED SPEAKING OF THINGS FOREIGN TO HIM--USUALLY OF PEOPLE HE DID NOT KNOW THEIR HOMES THEIR DOINGS THEIR DAUGHTERS AND THEIR FATHERS
SWIFT NEGOTIATIONS ENSUED AND A MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FARMERS LEAGUE WAS HELD IN MONTGOMERY
CRESSWELL IS IN WITH SMITH--BOTH DIRECTORS IN THE BIG COTTON COMBINE--AND SMITH WILL CALL ALWYN DOWN
BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT AND SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
MISS TAYLOR--MR ALWYN--AND WITH A BACKWARD CURVING OF HER NECK MR TEERSWELL AND SO ON
CRESSWELL'S BIG HOUSE AND YONDER TO THE WEST THE SCHOOL HE STARTED JOYFULLY
I DOESN'T SEE HE RETURNED REFLECTIVELY WIPING HIS BROWS AS HOW I CAN RIGHTLY SPARE YOU ANY TIME
THAT WILL NEVER DO
HE HAD MONEY ENOUGH AND HE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER
IF YOU LIKES IT IT AIN'T WORK DECLARED ZORA
THEY COULDN'T YES EVEN HURTS LIKE THIS
ALL YON GOLDEN FLEECE IS JASON'S NOW HE REPEATED
WOULD NOT COMRADESHIP ON THE BASIS OF THE NEW FRIENDSHIP WHICH SHE INSISTED ON BE THE DEATH OF LOVE AND THOUGHTS OF LOVE
OUR ADVANTAGE IS PLAIN AND JOHN TAYLOR GUARANTEES THE THING WHO'S JOHN TAYLOR SNORTED THE COLONEL
HE COULD ALMOST SEE THE BEAUTIFUL SILVER FLEECE BEDRAGGLED DROWNED AND ROLLING BENEATH THE BLACK LAKE OF SLIME
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT THE MAN WENT OUT AND THE SENATOR TURNED TO HIS DESK THEN PAUSED AND SMILED
YOU MUST CORRESPOND WITH MY BROTHER MR CRESSWELL SHE GRAVELY OBSERVED
WE WON'T GIT FREE THIS YEAR MISS SMITH NOT THIS YEAR SHE CONCLUDED PLAINTIVELY
A SMOOTH MARBLED FLOOR AND A GREAT THRONG WHOSE SILENT EYES LOOKED CURIOUSLY UPON HER
I DON'T KNOW HUMAN NATURE WELL ENOUGH AND I CAN'T TALK TO RICH WHITE FOLKS THE WAY THEY EXPECT US TO TALK IT WOULDN'T BE HYPOCRISY ZORA
IF SHE WAS NOT CAREFUL BUT WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ASKED HER HUSBAND
AH SAID MR VANDERPOOL
OUT FROM SOME FASTNESS OF THE WOOD CREPT ZORA
COME ON SHE MOCKED AND JOINED THEM
BREATHLESS SHE LISTENED DROPPING HER SEWING AND LEANING FORWARD EAGER-EYED
THEY WOULD COME WELL FED AND IMPRESSED WITH THE CHARMING HOSPITALITY OF THEIR HOSTS AND RATHER MORE THAN WILLING TO SEE THROUGH THOSE HOST'S EYES
IT WAS UPPER EARTH AND--HER HUSBAND BECKONED
HE GIVES COTTON TO CLOTHE YOU CORN TO EAT DEVOTED FRIENDS TO TEACH YOU
MARY TAYLOR ALONE OF THE COMMITTEE TOOK HER COMMISSION SO SERIOUSLY AS TO BE ANXIOUS TO BEGIN WORK
BOTH THE SHERIFF AND COLONEL CRESSWELL STARED AT HER
I LOOK UPON MR CRESSWELL'S VISIT TODAY AS ALMOST PROVIDENTIAL
HE STRETCHED HIS HAND OUT AND TAKING HERS HELD IT LIGHTLY TILL SHE QUIVERED AND DREW AWAY BENDING AGAIN OVER HER SEWING
UNTIL ONE DAY--IT WAS AFTER A SOUTHERN RAIN AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS TWINKLING THROUGH THE MORNING--ALL THE FLEECE WAS IN FLOWER--A MIGHTY SWAYING SEA DARKLING RICH AND WAVING AND UPON IT FLECKS AND STARS OF WHITE AND PURPLE FOAM
SHE WOULD PROTECT ALL BLACK GIRLS
THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE SAID LITTLE ABOUT THE NEGRO REVOLT AND AFFECTED TO IGNORE IT
IT'S THE GREY MONEY YOU KNOW THAT IS BACK OF US THAT'S JUST WHAT CONFOUNDS ME DECLARED THE PERPLEXED YOUNG MAN
MINE HER EYES MET HIS
FOR THE TIME OF HOEING WAS AT HAND
THE SHERIFF SCOWLED
PLANTATION MELODIES I SUPPOSE ARE MORE YOUR SPECIALTY HE SAID WITH A SLIGHT CADENCE
SIMPLY THE WORDS
EASTERLY WAS DISGUSTED
THEY'RE SELLING US OUT HE MUTTERED SAVAGELY
ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY--BIG PLANTER--NEAR WHERE MY SISTER TEACHES H'M--WELL WE'LL WATCH HIM AND SAY AS EASTERLY WAS TURNING AWAY YOU KNOW CONGRESSMAN SMITH I SHOULD SAY I DID WELL MRS GREY SEEMS TO BE DEPENDING ON HIM FOR ADVICE IN DISTRIBUTING SOME OF HER CHARITY FUNDS EASTERLY APPEARED STARTLED
NOW OUR WORK IS TO FORCE AMENDMENTS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BILL EFFECTIVE DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD JUST THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS INTEREST AND GET OUT
THEN THERE'S A NEW YOUNG LAWYER WHO WANTS HARRY CRESSWELL'S SEAT IN CONGRESS
NOT THAT SHE OBJECTED TO NEGROES AS HUMAN BEINGS--QUITE THE CONTRARY
HER GARMENTS TWINED AND FLEW IN SHADOWY DRAPINGS ABOUT THE PERFECT MOULDING OF HER YOUNG AND DARK HALF-NAKED FIGURE
BUT MEN AND WOMEN MUST LEARN TO BEAR HURTS IN THIS WORLD NOT HURTS LIKE THIS
I--ER--MEANT TO ASK IF COLONEL CRESSWELL IN SIGNING THIS PAPER MEANT TO SIGN A CONTRACT TO SELL THIS WENCH TWO HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND HE SAID HE DID REITERATED TAYLOR
HE KNEW IT AND HE TRIED TO WAGE IT COOLLY AND WITH METHOD
BUT I WANT THE CHILD--DIFFERENT DON'T YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT THE WOMAN QUIVERED AGAIN BUT SHE ANSWERED STEADILY
YOU'LL FIND THE BEST PEOPLE THERE HE SAID
DAY AFTER DAY BLES AND ZORA VISITED THE FIELD
FROM HER WINDOW SHE COULD SEE CRESSWELL'S STRAIGHT SHOULDERS AS HE RODE TOWARD TOWN AND BEYOND HIM A BLACK SPECK IN THE ROAD
WHEN SHE CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL SHE BOUGHT AN EVENING PAPER
MISS TAYLOR NOTICED HIS RIDING BREECHES AND LEGGINGS HIS WHITE LINEN AND WHITE CLEAN-CUT HIGH-BRED FACE
ZORA I'VE HAD SOMETHING ON MY MIND FOR A LONG TIME AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU HAD THOUGHT OF THE SAME THING WHAT IS IT BLES AND EMMA WHAT OF THEM THEIR LIKING FOR EACH OTHER ZORA BENT A MOMENT AND CAUGHT UP THE FOLDS OF THE FLEECE
HE HEARD A RUSTLE OF DEPARTING FEET BENEATH HIS WINDOW THEN A PAUSE AND A FAINT HALLOO
THE OTHER LANDLORDS SCARCELY LISTENED
HE LAUGHED GAYLY
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE DOOR OPENED AND A YOUNG LADY ENTERED
WASHINGTON WAS HIS FIRST GREAT CITY AND IT SEEMED A NEVER-ENDING DELIGHT--THE STREETS THE BUILDINGS THE CROWDS
THEY STOLE TOWARD HER WITH STEALTHY HANDS AND CLAW-LIKE TALONS
A DARK GREEN SILENCE LAY ABOUT THEM LIT BY MIGHTY CRIMSON GLORIES BEYOND
DID HE KNOW OF THE MORTGAGE TOO
SHE HAD NO CHILDREN FEW NEAR RELATIONS A HUSBAND WHO WENT HIS WAY AND STILL WAS A GENTLEMAN
ADDING FOOT-RESTS TO MAKE THE CLIMBING EASY PEEP-HOLES EAST AND WEST A BIT OF CARPET OVER THE BARK AND ON THE ROUGH MAIN TRUNK A LITTLE PICTURE IN BLUE AND GOLD OF BOUGEREAU'S MADONNA
BUT HE HAS FOUR THOUSAND A YEAR AND SENSE ENOUGH TO KEEP IT
YOU SEE ZORA THE MORE YOU KNOW THE MORE YOU CAN DO YES AND IF YOU ARE DETERMINED I WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE TAUGHT
WITHOUT A LAWYER BLES ALWYN STARED HIS AMAZEMENT
AND YET THERE CAME A NIGHT--A STUDENT'S SOCIAL--WHEN WITH A CERTAIN SUDDENNESS THE WHOLE SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PUPILS REALIZED THE NEWNESS OF THE GIRL AND EVEN BLES WAS STARTLED
THE DEBBILS DAT CRAWL
THE CHILDREN WILL BE KEPT IN THE COTTON FIELDS
AMERICAN COTTON-SPINNING SUPREMACY IS BUILT ON CHEAP COTTON
BUT TO BE NEGRO OR DARKENING TOWARD IT UNMISTAKABLY MEANS PERPETUAL HANDICAP AND CRUCIFIXION WHY NOT THEN ADMIT THAT YOU DRAW THE COLOR-LINE BECAUSE I DON'T
HER ABUNDANT HAIR WAS GONE
THE ROOM WAS A UNITY
FOR IT IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN MAIDENS RUN FROM LOVERS
IF RIGHT IS ON NEITHER SIDE OR SIMULTANEOUSLY ON BOTH THEN WAR IS NOT ONLY HELL BUT DAMNATION MRS GREY LOOKED SHOCKED AND MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY DEN SAID ZORA
PA ARE YOU GOING TO TOWN TODAY YES HONEY CAN I GO I'M GOING IN AN HOUR OR SO AND BUSINESS AT THE BANK WILL KEEP ME UNTIL AFTER LUNCH I DON'T CARE I JUST MUST GO
THE TRIAL WAS ALL SHE HAD ANTICIPATED AND POSSIBLY A BIT MORE
TO INSTALL TENANTS
TO REPLACE THE DAINTIEST OF TRAINED EXPERTS WITH THE MOST BAFFLING SEMI-BARBARIAN WELL
SHE WAS TROUBLED AND AGAIN A QUESTION EAGERLY HOVERED ON HER LIPS
BUT SHE WAS HUNGRY AND SHE ATE HEARTILY THEN LEANED BACK DREAMILY AND LISTENED TO MR CRESSWELL'S SMOOTH SOUTHERN R_'S ADDING A WORD HERE AND THERE THAT KEPT THE CONVERSATION GOING AND BROUGHT A GRAVE SMILE TO HIS PALE LIPS
ZORA HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU TELL LIES DON'T YOU YES SHE SAID SLOWLY
YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY ME SHE LOOKED AT HIM QUEERLY
THE SILVER FLEECE SHE MURMURED
THE VARIOUS CAUSES ADVOCATED BY THE CIVIC CLUB FELT THE IMPETUS OF THE AGGRESSIVE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION
TO TAKE CARRIE'S HAND AND TOGETHER FACE THE WORLD AND STRUGGLE AGAIN TO NEWER FINER TRIUMPHS--ALL THIS WOULD BE VERY CLOSE TO ATTAINMENT OF THE IDEAL
HERE SUDDENLY CAME AN EARNEST VOICE ADDRESSED BY SINGULAR CHANCE TO HER OF ALL THE WORLD
FLAMING PINE TORCHES BURNED ABOVE THE DEVOTEES
I MUST HAVE PASSED IT IN THE NIGHT I HATE IT CRIED THE GIRL HER LIPS TENSE
NO NEGRO STARVED ON THE CRESSWELL PLACE NEITHER DID ANY ACCUMULATE PROPERTY
MOREOVER SHE SAID ABOUT THAT SAME DATE I'M LIABLE TO LOSE MY POSITION AS TEACHER HE LOOKED AT HER QUICKLY AND SHE EXPLAINED THE COMING REVOLUTION IN SCHOOL MANAGEMENT
IN FACT THAT WAS MY FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH SO MUCH THE BETTER
HE STAMMERED FOR A PRETTY SPEECH BUT DID NOT FIND IT BEFORE SHE CONTINUED
I NEED YOU ZORA SHE SAID
POVERTY--UNCLOTHED WINELESS POVERTY TO DIG AND TOIL LIKE A NIGGER FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND TO GIVE UP HORSES AND CARRIAGES AND WOMEN
THE SILVER FLEECE WAS NOT HERS
I WANT TO MAKE THESE CHILDREN FULL-FLEDGED MEN AND WOMEN STRONG SELF-RELIANT HONEST WITHOUT ANY IFS AND ANDS TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT INSISTED MISS SMITH
HE KNEW WHEN IT WAS DIPLOMATIC TO FORGET HIS GRAMMAR AND ASSUME HIS DIALECT
WHY WE JUST HAVE TO CARRY THEM AND CARE FOR THEM LIKE CHILDREN
HE WAS LIGHT BROWN AND SHE WAS YELLOW
POSSIBLY A RATHER BEWILDERING NIGHT IN BROADWAY WAS EXPRESSING ITS INFLUENCE
HE BRUNG A PART OF DEM HERE AND HERE HIS SON DE FATHER OF DIS COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS BORN
IF SHE HAD COME TO YOU AS SHE DID TO ME YESTERDAY WITH HER THEORY THAT ALL THAT SOUTHERN NEGROES NEEDED WAS TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE GOOD SERVANTS AND LAY BRICK I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HER BLES TRIED TO INTERJECT
DID YOU MAKE THAT PIN SHE ASKED
YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT TO KEEP THE DARKIES DOWN FOREVER DO YOU NO I DON'T MAXWELL SLOWLY ADMITTED
I DOUBT IF WE SHALL HAVE TIME MRS GREY RETURNED AS THEY WALKED ON
THE GIRLS KNEW
BUTT IN
WORK FOR OTHERS
CAN IT BE BLES ALWYN SHE SAID THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THE SORT OF GIRL SHE IS HE RAISED HIS HANDS AND WARDED OFF HER WORDS DUMBLY AS SHE TURNED TO GO ALMOST FRIGHTENED AT THE HAVOC SHE SAW
SHE GLANCED ABSENTLY AT THE BOYS
YES THIS IS IT--GOOD-BYE--I MUST WAIT--WHAT IS YOUR NAME I HAVEN'T ANY NAME ANSWERED THE WOMAN SUSPICIOUSLY
I COULD NOT BE SO INHOSPITABLE AS TO SEND YOU AWAY HUNGRY AT THIS TIME OF DAY MISS TAYLOR SAT DOWN IN A COMFORTABLE LOW CHAIR FACING THE REFRESHING BREEZE AND FEASTED HER EYES ON THE SCENE
NO SHE MURMURED
WAS NOT THIS ANGRY BEATING RAIN THIS DULL SPIRITLESS DRIZZLE THIS WILD WAR OF AIR AND EARTH BUT FORETASTE AND PROPHECY OF RUIN AND DISCOURAGEMENT OF THE UTTER FUTILITY OF STRIVING
FROM TWO SIDES FROM LANDLORD AND WHITE LABORER CAME RENEWED OPPRESSION OF BLACK MEN
FINALLY THE CLERGYMAN AND MR BOCOMBE MRS GREY AND MRS VANDERPOOL AND MISS TAYLOR STARTED FOR THE SCHOOL WITH HARRY CRESSWELL ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER LUNCH
LATE THAT NIGHT THE GIRL LAY CLOSE IN MISS SMITH'S MOTHERLY EMBRACE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT
CRESSWELL WALKED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE WINDOW SWEPT BACK THE CURTAIN AND LOOKED TOWARD THE DARKNESS AND THE SWAMP
AND SECONDLY HE HAD SPENT ALL THE MONEY ON HER THAT HE INTENDED TO AT PRESENT AND HE WANTED HER TO GO TO WORK
HE TURNED BACK AND STOOD REGARDING HER WITH SORROWFUL EYES AND UGLY MOUTH
YES SAID BLES SIMPLY
SHE FELT WELL
SHALL I RESIGN AND BEG OR GO TILTING AT WINDMILLS
WE'LL JUST WORK IT TO THE INCH--JUST LOVE IT INTO LIFE SHE CONSIDERED THE MATTER INTENTLY
NOW I'M GOING TO ARRANGE TO ENDOW THIS SCHOOL WITH AT LEAST--AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
HE KNEW THE WELL-DRESSED MAN WITH HIS MILK-WHITE FACE AND OVERBEARING WAY
TRAVELLING WITH MRS VANDERPOOL THERE WAS ALWAYS A DAINTY LUNCH TO BE HAD AT CALL
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
BUT SHE SAID NO WORD SITTING NESTED AMONG THE GREENWOOD WITH PASSIONATE PROUD SILENCE UNTIL HE HAD SUED LONG FOR PEACE
ZORA SOFTLY BENT AND PASSED HER COOL SOFT HAND OVER HER FOREHEAD
TOGETHER THEY SUMMONED THE SHERIFF AND THE LOCAL MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
WELL YOU WILL DROP THIS BILL AND THE CIVIC CLUB FROM NOW ON WHY BECAUSE I SAY SO HE RETORTED EXPLOSIVELY TOO ANGRY TO EXPLAIN FURTHER
AND AS FOR CULTURE APPLIED TO THE MASSES YOU UTTER A PARADOX
SHE HAD STRUGGLED AND FOUGHT FOR HER BUT THE FORCES OF THE DEVIL HAD TRIUMPHED
FOR WAS HE NOT A CRESSWELL
HE SPOKE AT A BIG MEETING LAST NIGHT AT THE METROPOLITAN CHURCH
BUT THE SEED HE VENTURED
BUT HOW DO THEY HOPE TO MAKE MR ALWYN BLUNDER TOO EASILY I FEAR--UNLESS YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL
ELSPETH
ELSPETH
ELSPETH
ELSPETH
HAD SHE BEEN COMPELLED TO EARN A LIVING SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OR MANIPULATOR OF MEN
THEY WERE SUCH AS KNOW BEAUTY BY CONVENTION ONLY AND FIND IT LIP-RINGED HOOP-SKIRTED TATTOOED OR CORSETTED AS TIME AND PLACE DECREE
THEN WE CAN SELL IT AND SEND YOU TO SCHOOL SHE SAT SILENTLY BENT FORWARD TURNING THE PICTURE IN HER MIND
THE YOUNG LAWYER STARTED TO REFUSE TO TOUCH THE CASE UNTIL HE SAW--OR DID ZORA ADROITLY MAKE HIM SEE?--A CHANCE FOR EVENTUAL POLITICAL CAPITAL
IT ANSWERED FEW OF HIS QUESTIONS ARGUED WITH NONE OF HIS DOUBTS AND MADE NO MENTION OF ZORA
NO NOT THAT--ANOTHER PAPER
THUS TO BOTH PARTIES CAME THE UNCOMFORTABLE SPECTRE OF THE BLACK MEN AND BOTH SIDES WENT TO WORK TO LAY THE GHOST
ALTOGETHER THEY WERE DELIGHTFUL BUT CLOYING
AND MANY OF THE OTHER TEACHERS SAW NO BEAUTY ONLY A STRANGENESS THAT BROUGHT A SMILE
THE SACRIFICE MUST BE VAST
HERE IS A CHILD IN WHOM THE FOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT DEEP ARE SUDDENLY BROKEN UP
YOU CAN'T GET IT CLEARED HE SAID
BUT IT IS NOT SO MUCH IN THE GENERAL THEORY OF NEGRO EDUCATION AS IN ITS PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS WHERE OUR CHIEF DIFFERENCES WOULD LIE
BANG IT CRACKED INTO THE NIGHT
BEAR AND STAND STRAIGHT
SO IT WAS THAT THE FLEECE ROSE AND SPREAD AND GREW TO ITS WONDERFUL FLOWERING
BUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO SIDE-TRACK IT
SHE MUST GO AWAY
NOW SHE COULD FACE THE WORLD
I MADE NINETY-THREE IN THE EXAMINATION FOR A TREASURY CLERKSHIP AND NO APPOINTMENT
EASTERLY CONTINUED TO STARE AT HIS SUBORDINATE WITH A SORT OF FASCINATION WITH THE AWE THAT ONE FEELS WHEN GENIUS UNEXPECTEDLY REVEALS ITSELF FROM A SOURCE HITHERTO REGARDED AS ENTIRELY ORDINARY
HARRY TRUSTED TO THE NOVELTY OF HIS FATHER'S NEW WEALTH TO MAKE THE LATTER COMPLACENT
AND SO SHE HUNTED WORK EAGERLY
SHE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD DO SOMETHING FOOLISH IF SHE DID NOT WIN THIS BATTLE
SHE DID NOT STRUGGLE--SHE DROPPED HER HANDS LISTLESSLY WEARILY AND STOOD BUT HALF CONSCIOUS AS THE DOOR OPENED AND MR HARRY CRESSWELL ENTERED THE DIMLY LIGHTED ROOM
THEY USUALLY RIDE TO TOWN ABOUT THIS TIME BUT ALREADY MISS TAYLOR HAD DESCRIED THE BROWN AND TAWNY SIDES OF THE SPEEDING HORSES
YET THE SACRIFICE THE READJUSTMENT WAS HARD
SHE WAS LOOKING WORRIED BUT HOPEFUL OF THE NEW ENDOWMENT WHEN I LEFT THE SENATOR HELD OUT HIS HAND
HIS HEART IS SET ON IT
SHE NEVER THOUGHT OF APPEAL TO COURTS FOR COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND HIS SON WAS BAILIFF
SO HE SQUARED HIS JAW AND CHEATED ZORA DELIBERATELY IN THE MATTER OF THE CUT TIMBER
DO YOU KNOW THEM SHE ASKED ONE DAY AS THEY WERE LOUNGING IN WICKER CHAIRS ON THE VANDERPOOL PORCH
I'M TRYING NOW OSTENSIBLY FOR A CHIEF-CLERKSHIP UNDER BLES AND I'M PRETTY SURE OF IT
FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT OF HER LIFE SHE SAW HERSELF CLEARLY
I HATE IT BLES DON'T YOU HATE WHAT KILLING ANY OF IT
ON THIS POINT THEREFORE THERE ENSUED SPIRITED ARGUMENTS AND MUCH CORRESPONDENCE AND BOTH HER BROTHER AND HER LOVER EVINCED CHARACTERISTIC INTEREST IN THE PLANNING
CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL 244 TWENTY-SEVEN
SHE DID NOT MENTION THESE THINGS TO HER HUSBAND
AFTER THAT HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD EVICT ZORA IMMEDIATELY
HER VACILLATION PROMPTLY VANISHED AND SHE RESOLUTELY MOUNTED THE STEPS
CLOTHED IN A MIGHTY CALM YET SUBTLY MASTERFULLY VEILING BEHIND ITSELF DEPTHS OF UNFATHOMED MISERY AND WILD REVOLT
IN HER EYES LAY SLUMBERING THE MADNESS OF LONG AGO
AND MARY TAYLOR WAS VERY HAPPY
THE WORK WILL NOT BE HARD AND YOU CAN TRAVEL AND SEE THE WORLD AND LIVE WELL
AND THEN THE GIRL CROUCHED AT HER FEET AND TOLD THE DREAM AND THE STORY
NOT VERY MUCH SAID MR CRESSWELL DRILY
SEE HERE INTERRUPTED MRS VANDERPOOL
WAS THIS RAIN BEATING DOWN AND BACK HER LOVE FOR HIM OR HAD SHE NEVER LOVED
BUT--BUT HOW ARE--ALL ABRUPTLY SAM HOOKED HIS ARM INTO ALWYN'S AND PULLED HIM WITH HIM DOWN THE STREET
ISN'T BLES DEVELOPING SPLENDIDLY SHE SAID TO MISS SMITH ONE AFTERNOON
COME MY DEAR SHE SAID IT'S THE PROBLEM AGAIN THEY SAUNTERED AWAY TOWARD A RING OF LAUGHTER
NEXT MORNING MISS WYNN RATHER REPENTED HER HASTY INVITATION BUT OF COURSE NOTHING COULD BE DONE NOW
BUT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIS NECK WITH A JOYFUL HALF HYSTERICAL CRY
ABOUT ZORA
EVIDENTLY SHE WAS COMING TO HER KINGDOM
HERE IT WAS THAT SHE MADE HER MISTAKE
HOW HE ASKED DOUBTFULLY
BUT--YOU SEE JOHN I DON'T JUST KNOW WHETHER ONE COULD COOEPERATE WITH THE CRESSWELLS OR NOT--ONE HEARS SUCH CONTRADICTORY STORIES OF THEM
I THOUGHT BUT BLES WAS ALREADY TURNING
I'LL HAVE NO MORE OF YOUR LOAFING ABOUT MY PLACE AWAITING NO REPLY THE COLONEL ALREADY HALF ASHAMED OF HIS VEHEMENCE STORMED OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AND CLIMBED UPON HIS BAY MARE
GOD HAD TURNED IT STRAIGHT AGAIN
THE RECITAL BROUGHT TO HER NEW ENGLAND MIND MANY QUESTIONS OF POLICY AND PROPRIETY
THE DEAD MILLIONAIRE HAD BEGUN HIS FORTUNE BY BUYING AND SELLING COTTON--TRAVELLING IN THE SOUTH IN RECONSTRUCTION TIMES AND SENDING HIS AGENTS
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU THAT WAS CORRALLING THE NIGGERS AGAINST US HE EXCLAIMED
WELL WE HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DRINK SAID THE CHAIRMAN
ITS SILKEN FIBRES CRAMPED AND CLOSE SHONE YELLOW-WHITE IN THE SUNLIGHT
IT WILL RUIN OUR CAMPAIGN FOR THE FARMERS LEAGUE JOHN TAYLOR LOOKED AT CRESSWELL
THESE NIGGERS MUST HAVE A LESSON AND BEFORE NINE NEXT MORNING FULLY HALF THE GROWN MEMBERS OF THE SAME MOB NOW SWORN IN AS DEPUTIES RODE WITH HIM TO SEARCH THE SETTLEMENT
SHE DID NOT EXPECT THIS BUT SHE ASKED THE PORTER
I TELL YOU FATHER THE CODE OF THE SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN WON'T WORK IN WALL STREET AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY--THERE ARE NO SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN GROWLED HIS FATHER
TO HER ALL THINGS MEANT SOMETHING--NOTHING WAS AIMLESS NOTHING MERELY HAPPENED
NO MA'AM HE MUMBLED
NOW SEE HERE I'LL TREAT YOU AS WELL AS ANYBODY AND YOU KNOW IT I BELIEVE SO SIR ACKNOWLEDGED ZORA IN A TONE THAT BROUGHT A SUDDEN KEEN GLANCE FROM TAYLOR
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT WHITE PEOPLE HAD SUCH TROUBLES
WELL ARE YOU ALL MOVED AUNT RACHEL SHE INQUIRED CHEERFULLY
SO I USED THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAY ITS OWN INTEREST AND HELP RUN THE SCHOOL
AND IF HIS AUDIENCE FELT THAT GREAT DEPTH OF EMOTION THAT WELLED BENEATH HIS QUIET ALMOST HESITATING ADDRESS IT WAS NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID SAY BUT BECAUSE TOO OF THE UNSPOKEN STORY THAT LAY TOO DEEP FOR WORDS
HE STARED AT HER
OH I RECKON HE WILL IF HE'S A GOOD GOD BECAUSE HE'D KNOW THAT LIES LIKE THAT ARE HEAPS BETTER THAN BLABBING THE TRUTH RIGHT OUT
NOT ONLY WAS THE DOOR TO THE SMOKER STANDING OPEN BUT A WHITE PASSENGER WAS IN HER CAR SITTING BY THE CONDUCTOR AND PUFFING HEARTILY
VAGUELY SHOCKED HE GREW SO SILENT THAT SHE NOTICED IT AND CONCLUDED SHE HAD SAID TOO MUCH
THEY HAVE SELECTED BISHOP JOHNSON
HE GREETED BLES AND THE TEACHER COLDLY AND MOVED ON IN NERVOUS HASTE
BUT IN SOME RESPECTS THEIR LIVES MUST FLOW IN TWO STREAMS
LIQUOR BEGAN TO APPEAR AND HAPPY FACES GREW RED-EYED AND SODDEN AS THE DANCES WHIRLED
SHE LAID HER HAND GENTLY UPON HIS SHOULDER
OLD MRS GREY HAS BEEN TO SEE ME AND SHE HAS ANNOUNCED HER INTENTION OF ENDOWING FIVE COLORED SCHOOLS YOURS BEING ONE
ALL THIS HE IMPARTED TO JOHN TAYLOR TO WHICH THAT GENTLEMAN LISTENED CAREFULLY
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU TALK WITH THAT ALWYN NIGGER SHE WAS SILENT
IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOUR HUSBAND MIGHT LIKE SOMETHING POLITICAL
THEY AVOIDED EACH OTHER'S EYES
ZORA THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
UNSELFISHNESS IS SACRIFICE--JESUS WAS SUPREME SACRIFICE AMEN SCREAMED A VOICE IN YOUR DARK LIVES HE CRIED WHO IS THE KING OF GLORY
SHE RECOMMENDS HIM FOR THE CAMPAIGN WHAT TEERSWELL AGAIN EXPLODED
MISS SMITH SLOWLY CLOSED HER LETTER-FILE BUT DID NOT LOOK UP
SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UPON THE BLACK AND FLEECE-STREWN EARTH AND WRITHED
TO-MORROW WITH THE RISING SUN THEY WOULD BEGIN AGAIN
SCHOOL HAD CLOSED FOR THE YEAR AND BLES WITH THE CARRYALL WAS JUST TAKING MISS TAYLOR TO THE TRAIN WITH HER TRUNK AND BAGS
NO ORDINARY ATONEMENT WOULD DO
ONLY THE LITTLE THINGS IS DIFFERENT--AND I LIKE THE LITTLE STRANGE THINGS SPRING RIPENED TO SUMMER
WE WANT A LITTLE HOSPITAL WITH A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN AND TWO OR THREE NURSES
HE WOOED HER--WHETHER CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT SHE WAS ALWAYS UNCERTAIN--WITH EVERY QUIET ATTENTION AND SUBTLE DEFERENCE WITH A DEVOTION SEEMINGLY QUITE TOO DELICATE FOR WORDS
WHAT ELSE HE ASKED PAUSING WITH THE STEAMING DRINK POISED ALOFT
MISS TAYLOR WAS SOON STARVING FOR HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP FOR THE LIGHTER TOUCHES OF LIFE AND SOME OF ITS WARMTH AND LAUGHTER
SHE GREW OLDER QUIETER TALLER HE HUMBLER MORE TENDER AND REVERENT AS THEY TOILED TOGETHER
I THOUGHT PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED ACRES TWO HUNDRED ACRES
EARNEST THINGS
BUT NO COMPLAINT PASSED HER LIPS
I DO NOT WANT MONEY
BUT WHEN PEOPLE WERE SUDDENLY THRUST BEYOND THEIR NATURAL STATION FILLED WITH WILD IDEAS AND IMPOSSIBLE AMBITIONS IT MEANT TERRIBLE DANGER TO SOUTHERN WHITE WOMEN
SHE GLANCED AT THE HEAD-LINES--"PROMINENT NEGRO POLITICIAN CANDIDATE FOR HIGH OFFICE AT HANDS OF NEW ADMINISTRATION
PROMISE YOU WON'T TELL YES HE ANSWERED
AND HE SAW ONLY THE FLUTTER OF HER GOWN AND WAVED
THE SENATOR MADE A MEMORANDUM AND SAID
I THANK GOD HE GAVE YOU TO ME--JUST A LITTLE TIME SHE HESITATED AND WAITED
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER SIMPLY MONEY THAT HE WANTED BUT POWER
A PRAISE THAT PIQUED AS WELL AS PLEASED HIM BECAUSE IT IMPLIED A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO IT
I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP OUT THE NECESSARY SPICE OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD WAS ADDED TO THE PARTY BY MISS TAYLOR AND MISS CRESSWELL TOGETHER WITH THE SILENT MISS BOLDISH
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO HALT THE NEGRO THEN AND THERE AND TELL HIM A FEW PLAIN TRUTHS
HE WANTED THE PROTECTION OF A GOOD WOMAN AND SOMETIMES AGAINST THE CLEAR WHITENESS OF HER LETTERS SO JOYOUS AND GENEROUS EVEN IF A BIT PRIM AND DIDACTIC HE SAW A VISION OF HIMSELF REFLECTED AS HE WAS AND HE FEARED
RECEIVING NEITHER SHE WALKED WITH DIGNITY UP THE STAIRS
IT SEEMED AN EASY ALMOST AN OBVIOUS THING TO PROMISE AT THE TIME
AT LAST SHE HAD BROACHED A PHASE OF THE PROBLEM UPON WHICH HE COULD DILATE WITH FERVOR
HARRY CRESSWELL THE CRESSWELLS FATHER AND SON WERE AT BREAKFAST
I HAVE SHOWN HIM HIS PLACE
TO THAT FLAT-HEADED NO SHE COOLLY INTERRUPTED TO THE REGISTER OF THE TREASURY THE MAN WAS TOO DUMBFOUNDED TOO OVERWHELMED FOR COHERENT SPEECH
THAT REMINDS ME ELSPETH IS SENDING HER GIRL THERE WHAT'S THAT AN ANGRY GLEAM SHOT INTO THE YOUNGER MAN'S EYE
WOULD THEY FALL
OF COURSE THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE KEPT REPEATING TO HERSELF GREETING THE TEACHERS ABSENTLY--"FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN ON THE PORCH SHE WAS SUDDENLY AWARE OF THE AWAITING BOY
NO HE SAID
NO HE SAID
IT WAS ALL RIGHT SHE SUPPOSED
MULES MUNCHING GOLDEN EARS OF CORN AND MULES DROOPING THEIR HEADS IN SORROWFUL MEMORY OF BETTER DAYS
ZORA SHRANK BACK INTO THE SHADOWS AND LISTENED
BUT MR CRESSWELL DARKENED WITH ANGER
A CRESSWELL MARRIED IN COTTON HELEN WAS ALMOST IN TEARS LEST THE PARIS GOWN BE DELAYED AND SURE ENOUGH A CABLEGRAM CAME AT LAST SAYING THAT THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF THE GOWN BEING READY BY EASTER
THE DAY WAS WARM AND LANGUOROUS AND THE LAST PALE MIST OF THE SILVER FLEECE PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS
AS SHE PUT THE SEALED ENVELOPE IN HER TRUNK HER HAND CAME IN CONTACT WITH A LONG UNTOUCHED PACKAGE
LET THE DEBTS PILE UP
A MOMENT ALWYN STOOD WITHOUT AND LOOKED BACK
AS SHE HAD HOPED HE WAS WAITING FOR HER WHEN SHE REACHED HOME
BUT I DOUBT IF THE WAY TO GET NEGRO RIGHTS IS TO VOTE FOR THOSE WHO TOOK THEM AWAY I AGREE WITH YOU PERFECTLY SAID BLES
WITHIN AROSE NOISY SHOUTS LOUD SONGS AND RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
MISS WYNN I HAVE A MAID--SUCH AN INTELLIGENT GIRL
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HURRIED INTO THE SCHOOL BUILDING CLOSING THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
CRASH!_"--THE DOOR WAVERED SPLINTERED AND DROPPED UPON THE FLOOR
PEANUTS BLES SPECIFIED
YOU SHOULD NOT WANDER HERE ALONE--IT IS DANGEROUS WHY DANGEROUS SHE ASKED
WHY THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING
I HAVE HESITATED BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK OR EXPLAIN TO--TO--A GOOD WOMAN HE FELT HER ARM TIGHTEN ON HIS AND HE CONTINUED
WANT TO GO I WAS GOING TO HEAR AN ART LECTURE AT THE CLUB MARY RETURNED AND GREW THOUGHTFUL
I SAW HIM COME UP--HE MUST HAVE ENTERED
BUT SOMEHOW IN THE LONG DARK WANDERINGS WHICH SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE HABIT OF TAKING AT NIGHTFALL SHE STOOD ONE EVENING BEFORE IT
WHEREUPON HARRY CRESSWELL INTRODUCED JOHN TAYLOR WHO REPRESENTED THIRTY MILLIONS OF SOUTHERN BANK STOCK
WHEN COTTON FELL THE LANDLORDS SQUEEZED THE RATIONS AND LOWERED THE WAGES
FORGETTING HER INFORMAL ATTIRE SHE OPENED THE DOOR FEARING SOME MISHAP
LET CRESSWELL TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE THING
WHAT'S THE MERE COLOR OF A HUMAN SOUL'S SKIN SHE HAD CRIED TO A WELLESLEY AUDIENCE AND THE AUDIENCE HAD APPLAUDED WITH ENTHUSIASM
I'M GOING TO JOIN WITH YOU TO CRUSH THIS YANKEE AND PUT THE NIGGERS IN THEIR PLACES
SOMETHING HAD TO BE SAID
AND NOW BEYOND THIS INSENSIBLY THEY WERE DRIFTING TO A SILENTER MIGHTIER MINGLING OF SOULS
EDUCATED BUT GOOD FOR NOTHING
TOWN 23 FIVE
MISS TAYLOR REDDENED
THE BAND CRASHED AND BLARED
THEN COMING ROUND BACK OF HIS CHAIR SHE PLACED HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK
WHAT IS THE MATTER BLES SHE ASKED
I USE THE WORLD
TO BE AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE JOHN VANDERPOOL ESQ THE FIRST FEELING OF TRIUMPH THRILLED FAINTLY AGAIN UNTIL THE LOW VOICE OF ZORA STARTLED HER
THE MOVEMENT BECAME STRONG ENOUGH TO CALL MR EASTERLY DOWN FROM NEW YORK
HE FEARED RAIN
ZORA CAME GENTLY FORWARD AND SLIPPED HER ARMS LOVINGLY ABOUT THE OTHER WOMAN'S NECK
AS THE DAY WORE ON ZORA FOUND HERSELF STRANGELY WEARY
DR BOLDISH NATURALLY THE APPOINTED SPOKESMAN LOOKED HELPLESSLY ABOUT AND WHISPERED TO MRS VANDERPOOL
WHERE DOES THIS ROAD COME OUT SHE ASKED AT LAST
WHAT OF THE MORNING
SHE SAT DREAMING OF IT HERE WITH ROWS OF DARK FACES BEFORE HER AND THE SINGSONG WAIL OF A LITTLE BLACK READER WITH HIS HEAD ASLANT AND HIS PATCHED KNEEPANTS
WORSE AND BETTER HE REPLIED SMILING CYNICALLY
SHE STOOD VERY STILL AND LIFTED UP HER EYES
WHAT
MRS CRESSWELL SAT DOWN LIMPLY
HE HAD STOOPED LOW TO THIS YANKEE SCHOOL-MA'AM LOWER THAN HE HAD EVER STOOPED TO A WOMAN
STRONG MEASURES ARE NEEDED
BUT IT'S A LUXURY FEW OF US NEGROES CAN AFFORD
MONEY TO BUY TENANTS TO LIVE ON IT
THE CAMPAIGN 230 TWENTY-SIX
AN HOUR LATER MISS SMITH LOOKED IN THEN SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LIGHTLY AND LEFT
MISS JONES'S SMILE OF PARDON WAS WINTRY
I'LL THINK IT OVER A STIR IN THE PARLOR INDICATED DEPARTURE
THE VEIL OF COLOR AND RACE STILL HUNG THICKLY BETWEEN HER AND HER PUPILS
YOU MAKE HER AN EQUAL
FOR OF COURSE IF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION GOES I LOSE MY PLACE SHE LIFTED HER HEAD AND STARED ALONG THE AVENUE
WITH PEACEFUL SOCIAL CONDITIONS THE RETURNS WILL BE LARGE MRS GREY HEARD THIS DELICATE FLATTERY COMPLACENTLY
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN PARIS TWO MONTHS LATER THEY PARTED SIMPLY KNOWING WELL IT WAS FOREVER
THEY LIGHTED IT AND ITS SMOKY FLAME THREW WAVERING SHADOWS ABOUT
NOW I AS A MATTER OF AESTHETIC BEAUTY PREFER YOUR BROWN-VELVET COLOR TO A JAUNDICED YELLOW OR EVEN AN UNCERTAIN CREAM
IT WAS THE WAY AND IT WAS OPENING BEFORE HER BECAUSE THE TALISMAN LAY IN HER TRUNK
SOON AS POSSIBLE SAM MADE HIM WAIT A HALF-HOUR FOR THE SAKE OF DISCIPLINE AND THEN BROUGHT FATHER AND SON
ENGAGED GASPED MRS VANDERPOOL
THE LONGER SHE THOUGHT THE MORE BEWILDERED SHE GREW
PUT THE CHILD LABOR BILL FIRST AND WE'LL WORK THE PRESS
BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN YOU'RE EDUCATED YOU WON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THE SWAMP I WANTS TO LIVE HERE ALWAYS BUT NOT AT ELSPETH'S NO-O--NOT THERE NOT THERE AND A TROUBLED QUESTIONING TREMBLED IN HER EYES BUT BROUGHT NO ANSWERING THOUGHT IN HIS FOR HE WAS BUSY WITH HIS PLANS
THE DARK BROWN VELVET OF HER SKIN PULSED WARM AND TREMULOUS WITH THE UPRUSHING BLOOD AND IN THE MIDNIGHT DEPTHS OF HER GREAT EYES FLAMED THE MIGHTY FIRES OF LONG-CONCEALED AND NEW-BORN LOVE
DE SON--I KNOWED HIM WELL--HE HAD A TOUSAND NIGGERS AND TEN TOUSAND ACRES AFORE DE WAR WERE THEY KIND TO THEIR SLAVES OH YAAS YAAS MA'AM DEY WAS CAREFUL OF DE'RE NIGGERS AND WOULDN'T LET DE DRIVERS WHIP EM MUCH AND THESE CRESSWELLS TODAY OH DEY'RE QUALITY--HIGH-BLOODED FOLKS--DEY'SE LOST SOME LAND AND NIGGERS BUT LORDY NUTTIN CAN BUY DE CRESSWELLS DEY NATURALLY OWNS DE WORLD ARE THEY HONEST AND KIND OH YAAS MA'AM--DEY'SE GOOD WHITE FOLKS GOOD WHITE FOLK OH YAAS MA'AM--COURSE YOU KNOWS WHITE FOLKS WILL BE WHITE FOLKS--WHITE FOLKS WILL BE WHITE FOLKS
PERHAPS THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE LAY SEALED WITHIN THE ENVELOPE HE FINGERED
HOWDY UNCLE JIM HOWDY SON
ATTEMPT TO KILL A WHITE MAN ANY WITNESSES NONE EXCEPT THE VICTIM AND I SAID ZORA COMING FORWARD
YOU STOLE IT
HE MUST AT LEAST SEE THE GRAVE OF HIS HOPE AND ZORA'S AND OUT OF IT RESURRECT NEW LOVE AND STRENGTH
HE COULD NOT GRASP IT
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER FOR A YEAR YOU OLD DEVIL THE HAG WHIMPERED AND SNARLED
MRS VANDERPOOL HEARD MISS WYNN'S STORY NEXT DAY WITH SOME INWARD DISMAY
MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKED SURPRISED BUT MISS SMITH ADDED
THERE WAS CRAFTILY ADVANCED MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND RIOT IN THEIR HEARTS
THUS IT HAD HAPPENED THAT MISS TAYLOR CAME TO LAKE GEORGE FOR HER VACATION AFTER THE FIRST YEAR AT THE SMITH SCHOOL AND SHE AND MISS SMITH HAD SILENTLY AGREED AS SHE LEFT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER NOT TO RETURN
HE PICTURED THEIR SIN AND NEGLECT
BELTS SERVED A BETTER PURPOSE
SUDDENLY THE HORROR OF THE SWAMP WAS UPON HER
I SORT OF THOUGHT EDUCATION WOULD IMPROVE THINGS IN THE SOUTH HE COMMENTED UNMOVED
HER OWN HEART VOICED ALL HE DID NOT SAY AND PLEADED FOR HIM TO HER OWN CONFUSION
OF COURSE WE CANNOT THINK OF KEEPING HER MISS SMITH PURSED HER LIPS OFFERING HER FIRST EXPRESSION OF OPINION
HELEN WAS APPEALING TO MRS VANDERPOOL
BUT I'VE GOT JUST OODLES OF WORK WHAT
HARRY WAS IN A TIGHT PLACE--GAMBLING AS USUAL--AND I GAVE HIM A LUMP SUM IN LIEU OF ALL CLAIMS
IT WAS THE SUM SHE WANTED
SHE THINKS ME AN UNUSUALLY CLEVER PERSON WHO BY A PROCESS OF THOUGHT NOT UNLIKE HER OWN HAS ARRIVED AT VERY SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS BUT--BUT OBJECTED BLES IF THE TIME SPENT CAJOLING FOOLS WERE USED IN CONVINCING THE HONEST AND UPRIGHT THINK HOW MUCH WE WOULD GAIN VERY LITTLE
FOR HELEN WAS DECKED IN PARISIAN SPLENDOR WHILE MARY WAS GOWNED IN THE FLEECE
BUT SHE IS UNNATURALLY FORWARD TOO BRIGHT MISS SMITH AMPLIFIED
ORDER MY TRAP HE FINALLY DIRECTED
NOW YOUR FRIEND MISS WYNN"--ALWYN STARTED--"IS EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS HE HANDED HER LETTER TO THE YOUNG MAN AND POINTED OUT THE WORDS
HE READ THE PAGE
THEY LOOKED AT THE LAND EXAMINED THE PROPOSED FARM SITES AND VIEWED THE LIVING-ROOM AND DORMITORY IN THE HOUSE
THE CUTTING MUST BEGIN AT ONCE THEY ALL AGREED
MRS CRESSWELL HE BEGAN HURRIEDLY THERE'S A MATTER--A PERSONAL MATTER OF WHICH I HAVE WANTED TO SPEAK--A LONG TIME--I THE DINNER-BELL RANG AND HE STOPPED VEXED
THE OLD-STYLE NEGRO POLITICIANS ARE NO MATCH FOR THEM AND THE CROWD OF OFFICE-HOLDERS ARE RATHER BEWILDERED
WHAT'S YOUR NAME BLESSED ALWYN HE ANSWERED AND THE PASSING TEACHERS SMILED
SHE CUDDLED INTO A LITTLE HEAP NURSING HER KNEES AND ANSWERED SLOWLY
BUT WHY LONELY
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THAT SWAMP CLEARED HOW SELL IT TO SOME FOOL DARKEY SELL IT
IT'S THE BIGGEST CORNER IN YEARS BUT HOW'S COTTON TICKER SAYS SIX AND THREE-FOURTHS CRESSWELL SAT DOWN ABRUPTLY OPPOSITE TAYLOR LOOKING AT HIM FIXEDLY
YOU WOULD FAR BETTER GO BACK TO ALABAMA"--PAUSING AND LOOKING AT THE YOUNG MAN KEENLY--"BUT YOU WON'T--YOU WON'T--NOT YET AT ANY RATE AND BLES SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY
BE GOOD
ROBERT YOU MAY SUCCEED
BUT SHE CANNOT BE DRIVEN
BACK BY THE PLACE OF THE SILVER FLEECE THEY WANDERED ACROSS THE BIG ROAD UP TO THE MANSION
SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF INSTINCTIVELY AND THOUGHT OF SOME REMARK THAT WOULD RESTORE PROPER RELATIONS
SHE SEEMED TO BE RIDING OUT OF DREAMLAND ON SOME HOBGOBLIN BEAST
MRS CRESSWELL HAD SEEN HER AND HAD TALKED TO HER AND WATCHED HER
GOOD-BYE AND THE DARK GROANING DEPTHS OF THE CABIN SWALLOWED HER
AND LONG PENDENT STREAMINGS OF MOSS-LIKE TEARS DRIPPED FROM TREE TO EARTH
WILL YOU GO SURE THING
A MOMENT ZORA LOOKED DOWN UPON HER MOTHER
THE PREACHER FIDGETED AND COUGHED BUT DARED NOT ACTUALLY INTERRUPT FOR THE PEOPLE WERE LISTENING BREATHLESS TO A KIND OF STRAIGHTFORWARD TALK WHICH THEY SELDOM HEARD AND FOR WHICH THEY WERE HUNGERING
HE SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE SO IMPORTANT THAT NEGROES WOULD NOT THINK OF LEAVING THEIR PARTY AGAIN MRS VANDERPOOL TOOK PAINS TO REPEAT ZORA'S WORDS TO MR EASTERLY
THEY TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND MARCHED HIM TOWARD TOWN
OH THAT'S A SWELL PLACE SHE SAID
AND WHAT'S BEYOND THE SWAMP SHE CROUCHED BESIDE HIM AND WHISPERED IN EAGER TENSE TONES
THEY CLUTCHED AT HER SKIRTS
THE WEAK AND THE IGNORANT OF ALL RACES HE DESPISED AND HAD NO PATIENCE WITH THEM
DO THEY GET THAT--TEN CENTS AN HOUR ASKED MISS TAYLOR
MARY HAS THAT ALWYN NIGGER BEEN HERE THIS AFTERNOON MR CRESSWELL WAS COMING UP-STAIRS CARRYING HIS RIDING WHIP
THEN IN QUICK FRENZY SHOTS FLEW
SLOWLY AND LIGHTLY MISS SMITH SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT ZORA AND NODDED AND SMILED A PERFECT UNDERSTANDING
WE MUST NOT OFFEND THE SOUTH AND WE MUST PLACATE THE NEGROES HE SAID
YOU'RE OLD-FASHIONED
THE SENATORS PROTECTED THEIR FRIENDS IN THE CRUSH
SHE DID NOT SEE MRS VANDERPOOL ARRIVING FROM NEW ORLEANS
ZORA OPENED IT
ALL THIS FINE FRENZY WAS USELESS AND HE KNEW IT
WORKED OUT AND NOT WORTH FIVE DOLLARS AN ACRE SNAPPED THE COLONEL
AND FOR A SECOND TIME THAT MORNING A VISION OF HIS OWN YOUTH DIMMED HIS EYES
I MEANT TO MAKE HIM SEE THAT HE COULD YIELD WITHOUT GREAT COST
I AM PLEADING WITH YOU TO HELP YOURSELVES
THE WAY WHERE ZORA SAT UP IN BED AND LIFTED A GRAY AND STRICKEN FACE
NO NEVER IF HE'S BLACK AND NOT ALWAYS WHEN HE'S WHITE AND HE STALKED AWAY
SHE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
I DON'T WANT IT SHE DECLARED
REALLY THOUGH I SUSPECT I OUGHT TO TELL MISS SMITH HE LOOKED A LITTLE PERPLEXED
YET IN THEIR SILENCES THEIR WALKS AND THEIR SITTINGS THERE WAS A COMPANIONSHIP A GLOW A SATISFACTION AS CAME TO THEM NOWHERE ELSE ON EARTH AND THEY WONDERED AT IT
HE CRAVED THE MADNESS OF ALCOHOL IN HIS VEINS TILL HIS DELICATE HANDS TREMBLED OF MORNINGS
I KNEW YOU'D BE GLAD GLAD
PROBABLY HE WOULD BEAT ROUND THE BUSH SEEKING FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT
YOU MUSTN'T GO TOO BUT THE BLACK GIRL DREW PROUDLY BACK
ELSPETH AND THE GIRL TALKED AND LAUGHED COARSELY AND THE NIGHT WORE ON
HER ADVISER IN THIS LINE HOWEVER IS SMITH AND HE BELONGS TO US WHAT SMITH WHY THE MAN WHO'S GOING TO BE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY
SHE MIXED HIS SALAD AND SELECTED HIS WINE
THE HOTEL EMPLOYEES THINK HER PERFECT
HE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BOWER THAT HE HAD BUILT HER IN THE COTTON FIELD
FOR THIRTY YEARS SHE HAD SOWN THE SEED PLANTING HER LIFE-BLOOD IN THIS WORK THAT HAD BECOME THE MARROW OF HER SOUL
AND SOME IS LITTLE AND BROAD AND BLACK AND THEY YELLS THE BOY WAS LISTENING IN INCREDULOUS CURIOSITY HALF MINDED TO LAUGH HALF MINDED TO EDGE AWAY FROM THE BLACK-RED RADIANCE OF YONDER DUSKY SWAMP
HE FOLLOWED LAUGHING CALLING PLEADING
A FRIEND SENT ME SOME MONEY
SOMETHING OF HERSELF SOMETHING DEARER THAN SELF WAS GONE FROM HER FOREVER AND AN INFINITE LONELINESS AND SILENCE AS OF ENDLESS YEARS SETTLED ON HER SOUL
WELL THERE I WAS WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IDLE ON MY HANDS PAYING TEN PER CENT ON IT AND GETTING LESS THAN THREE PER CENT
I WANT TO DO THE BEST THING BUT I'M PUZZLED
YET SHE BABBLED ON TREMBLINGLY
HE WAS A GREAT VIRILE BOY REQUIRING A SIMPLE AFFECTIONATE MATE
THEN WHEN THE WIND FELL MURMURING AWAY THE CLOUDS GREW BLACKER AND BLACKER AND RAIN IN LONG SLIM COLUMNS FELL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN TO EARTH DIGGING ITSELF INTO THE LAND AND THROWING BACK THE RED MUD IN ANGRY FLASHES
TO REFUSE TO WORK FOR THE CRESSWELLS MEANT TROUBLE FOR THE SCHOOL AND PERHAPS ARREST FOR HERSELF
OH I HAVE WAYS OF FINDING THINGS OUT
BUT HE GLANCED FURTIVELY AT HER SHORT HAIR
THERE WAS A FELLOW STILLINGS WHOM ALWYN HAD INTRODUCED AND WHOM SHE HAD HEARD OF
ON THE OTHER HAND THE FATHER INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
BUT HE DID NOT SLEEP
I WILL NOT WORRY YOUR HONOR BY A LONG ARGUMENT TO PROVE THIS BUT JUST CALL ONE OF THE WITNESSES WELL KNOWN TO YOU--MR JOHN TAYLOR OF THE TOOMSVILLE MILLS TAYLOR LOOKED TOWARD THE DOOR AND THEN SLOWLY TOOK THE STAND
ONLY DURING THE DAYLIGHT SUNDAYS DID ITS MURMUR DIE TO A SIBILANT HISS
THEY WERE A MOTLEY CROWD RAGGED SWAGGERING JOLLY
THE POETRY OF THE THING BEGAN TO SING WITHIN HER AWAKENING HER UNPOETIC IMAGINATION AND SHE MURMURED
BUT THERE WAS ONE PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HIS CODE OF HONOR DID NOT COVER AND HE SAW NO INCONGRUITY IN THE OMISSION
WHAT'S THE CHARGE HERE SAID THE JUDGE POINTING TO AUNT RACHEL'S BOY
THE COMPANY NOW BEGAN TO GATHER AND SOON THE DOUBLE PARLOR HELD AN ASSEMBLAGE OF TWENTY-FIVE OR THIRTY PERSONS
BLES PEEPED IN--THERE WAS NOT ROOM TO ENTER
NO SAID HE FINALLY IT IS NOT NECESSARY ALWAYS TO TELL ALL THE TRUTH
SHOULD SHE ATTEMPT TO GO INTO THIS PICTURE SHOW SHE WOULD BE DENIED ENTRANCE
NONSENSE HE INDIGNANTLY REPUDIATED THE MEASURE
REMEMBER THAT THE SLAVERY OF YOUR PEOPLE WAS NOT NECESSARILY A CRIME
BUT I DON'T LOVE EMMA
THE DRESSMAKER WAS RIPPING AND SNIPPING AND SOON THERE LAY REVEALED BEFORE THEM--THE PARIS GOWN
I--HOPE I'M NOT TOO BLUNT
BUT JUST THEN THE CROWD PUSHED THEM APART AND SHOT THEM ALONG AND MRS CRESSWELL FOUND HERSELF CLINGING TO HER HUSBAND AMID TWO GREAT WHIRLING VARIEGATED THRONGS OF DRIVING WHITE-FACED PEOPLE
BUT EVEN AS SHE CRIED A FLASH AND TREMOR SHOOK THE SOUTH
THE PLACE SOON FILLED WITH A LAZY TOBACCO-CHEWING THRONG OF WHITE MEN
HUGE BONFIRES BLAZED AND CRACKLED UNTIL AT LAST A WIDE BLACK SCAR APPEARED IN THE THICK SOUTH SIDE OF THE SWAMP WHICH WIDENED AND WIDENED TO FULL TWENTY ACRES
SHE KNEW IT WOULD RING UP-STAIRS IN HIS ROOM BUT SHE USUALLY ANSWERED IT FOR HE DISLIKED TO
HE POINTED WITH ONE SWEEP OF HIS LONG ARM TO THE QUIVERING MASS OF GREEN-GOLD FOLIAGE THAT SWEPT FROM SWAMP TO HORIZON
I WANT TO BE BETTER KNOWN AMONG INFLUENTIAL NEGROES
AT ANY RATE THE EDUCATIONAL BILL MUST BE KILLED RIGHT OFF
HE EDGED OVER TO JOHN TAYLOR AND SPOKE TO HIM
ZORA'S WAY 309 THIRTY-THREE
IT IRRITATED HIM UNREASONABLY
ALL SAVE PERHAPS MR SMITH UNBENT THE ENGLISHMAN ESPECIALLY AND THE VANDERPOOLS WERE MOST GRACIOUS
HE HAD BEEN PROMISED THE BACKING OF THE WHOLE SOUTHERN DELEGATION IN HIS SCHEMES
SHE SAW TYPES OF ALL NATIONS AND ALL LANDS SWIRLING BENEATH HER IN HUMAN BROTHERHOOD AND A GREAT WONDER SHOOK HER
THAT WAS THE SILVER FLEECE
WHEN WILL YOU GO ZORA WHEN YOU LEAVE FOR THE SUMMER MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKED OUT UPON THE BEAUTIFUL CITY
SHE AND COLONEL CRESSWELL LUNCHED RATHER SILENTLY
BUT HIS HANDS WERE TIED--MANACLED
FOR A LONG TIME THE GIRL HAD GIVEN HERSELF UP TO THE SHEER DELIGHT OF MOTION
SYKES--JIM SYKES--THAT'S ME YES I'VE HEARD OF YOU MR SYKES
ROBERT WHERE IS THE LAND CRESSWELL OFFERS YOU IT'S ON THE TOLLIVER PLACE THE TOLLIVER PLACE YES HE IS GOING TO BUY IT MISS SMITH DISMISSED THE BOY ABSENTLY AND SAT DOWN
SHE PASSED ON AND HEARD HER HUSBAND'S PETULANT VOICE IN HER EAR
WITH CHARACTERISTIC DECISION SHE BEGAN HER PLANS AT ONCE
QUICK REWARD AND PROMOTION WERE ESSENTIAL TO HARRY'S SUCCESS
NONSENSE GIRL
THEN SILENCE AND FOOTSTEPS WANDERING FURTIVELY ABOUT
IF A MAN HAD ABILITY AND PUSH TAYLOR WAS WILLING AND ANXIOUS TO OPEN THE WAY FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH HE WERE BLACK
THEN SHE PRESSED ON MORE SWIFTLY AND FED MORE SCANTILY UNTIL FINALLY WITH THE MOONLIGHT POURING OVER THEM AT THE BLACK LAGOON ZORA ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE ANIMAL INTO THE STILL WATERS
BUT HE FELT HE HAD PREACHED ENOUGH
AND YET--MORE INTERESTING THEN WITH A PUZZLED LOOK
THEY WERE APPROACHING THE MAIN ROAD AGAIN WHEN THERE CAME A FLUTTERING AS OF A GREAT BIRD BEATING ITS WINGS AMID THE FOREST
IF YOU WILL WITHDRAW I WILL PAY YOU ANY REASONABLE SUM THANK YOU
SHE HESITATED LOOKING FOR SOME WAY OF ESCAPE
NOT BETTER--NOT BETTER THAN SHE KNOWS BUT JUST AS GOOD IN--LYING AND STEALING AND--AND EVERYTHING BLES SMILED
THE RICH MRS GREY WAS AT THE CRISIS OF HER FORTUNES
DU BOIS 1911 A.C
BUT HE HAD SIMPLY POINTED THE WAY AND THE WAY WAS HUMAN
MARY TAYLOR HAD CHARGE OF THE OFFICE THAT MORNING WHILE MISS SMITH SHUT UP IN HER BEDROOM WENT LABORIOUSLY OVER HER ACCOUNTS
THEN SUDDENLY HE BETHOUGHT HIM AGAIN OF THAT VISION OF THE NIGHT--THE WAVING ARMS AND FLYING LIMBS OF THE GIRL AND HER GREAT BLACK EYES LOOKING INTO THE NIGHT AND CALLING HIM
JUST TOLERABLE HONEY BLESS DE LORD
YES SIR I SUPPOSE SO WE MIGHT PAY THE RAILROAD FARE THANK YOU SIR
IT WOULD BE BUT A DAY OR SO LATE GETTING TO NEW YORK
ALWYN'S ABSURD CONSCIENCE AND QUIXOTIC IDEAS WERE DIFFICULT TO COPE WITH
BRETHREN HE BEGAN THE PLAN'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR TALKIN BUT YOU CAN'T WORK IT
I THOUGHT IT BUT RIGHT TO LET YOU KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH
SHE REACHED UP AND TOOK DOWN A WELL-WORN BOOK
EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE CAME TO THE SCHOOL
THESE NIGGERS ARE MIGHTY EXTRAVAGANT
GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT UNDERGROUND ON THE ROOTS--LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO YES AND WE--WE DON'T PICK COTTON STALKS EXCEPT FOR KINDLING I MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING OF HEMP
YES YOU IS--EVERYBODY'S FEARED OF OLD ELSPETH
IF YOU STRIKE THEY'LL GET YOUR JOBS SURE
KILL THE NIGGERS AND THEY CAME ON WITH A RUSH
HUSH HE GASPED
THE DELAY AND SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AMONG THE LITTLE FOLKS HAD UPSET THINGS CONSIDERABLY THERE BUT AT THE SIGHT OF THE VISITORS AT THE GATE MISS SMITH RANG THE BELL
YOU DO THE REST--SEE WHO'LL BE THE COMMITTEE ASKED CRESSWELL
LET'S SEE WE'VE GOT HE FIGURED WHILE THE WHEEL WHIRRED--"7--7-1/2--8--8-1/2 CRESSWELL LISTENED STAGGERED TO HIS FEET HIS FACE CRIMSON AND HIS HAIR WILD
OVER AND OVER SHE WHISPERED TO HERSELF
NOW THE TRAMP OF FOOTSTEPS COULD BE HEARD AND CLEARER AND THICKER THE GRATING AND BOOMING OF VOICES UNTIL SUDDENLY FAR UP THE PIKE A BLACK MOVING MASS WITH GLITTER AND SHOUT SWEPT INTO VIEW
LISTEN
BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT IT WAS THE NEGROES THEMSELVES WHO STIRRED THE SOUTH TO THIS DEMAND NOT AT ALL
WHAT WAS THE USE OF TRYING FOR ANYTHING
THE POINT IS MR CRESSWELL NEVER INTENDED--NEVER DREAMED OF SELLING THIS WENCH LAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS DOOR
THEY SAW ITS HUMOR AND ITS CROWDING ITS BIZARRE EFFECTS AND UNWONTED PAGEANTRY
NOW ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE OFFENDING THE SOUTHERNERS IN THREE WAYS
THEN AS THE MEETING BROKE UP AND MRS CRESSWELL CAME FORWARD TO SPEAK TO ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL MANAGED TO FIND HERSELF NEAR MISS WYNN AND TO BE INTRODUCED
SHE RAISED THE RECEIVER AND STARTED TO SPEAK WHEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD BROKEN INTO THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION
NOW MISS SMITH SHE BEGAN--BUT MISS SMITH LOOKED AT HER AND SAID STERNLY SIT DOWN MARY TAYLOR SAT DOWN
TWENTY-EIGHT THE ANNUNCIATION THE NEW PRESIDENT HAD BEEN INAUGURATED
WIND OF THE ESTRANGEMENT FLEW OVER TOWN QUICKLY
WE CAN'T SHE SAID
BUT WHERE IS IT SHE ASKED
SOME DEVILS IS BIG AND WHITE LIKE HA'NTS
IN A WORLD OF BOOKS BUILDED THOUGHTFULLY FOR HER BY MRS VANDERPOOL AND BEFORE THAT BY MISS SMITH
HER HANDS NEVER WAVERED AND HER EYES MET HIS STEADILY AND GRAVELY
BUT SAKES ALIVE
MARY TAYLOR HER HEAD IN A WHIRL CAME FORWARD
KERCHIEFED AUNTIES GIGGLING BLACK GIRLS SAFFRON BEAUTIES AND LOAFING WHITE MEN
HOW THE DEVIL THE COLONEL WAS FORGETTING HIS GUESTS BUT HARRY INTERVENED
SO THE DAYS PASSED
AFTER ALL SHE KNEW LITTLE OF THIS STRANGE FAITH OF THEIRS--HAD LITTLE BELIEF IN ITS MUMMERY
MRS GREY ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE EASTERLYS AND JOHN TAYLOR FOR THE WEEK-END
SHE WAS NOW SO OLD AND AGAIN SO MUCH A CHILD AN EAGER QUESTIONING CHILD THAT THERE SEEMED ABOUT HER INNOCENCE SOMETHING HOLY
COME OUT FROM IT
SHE THREW BACK HER HEAD RAISED THE LIQUOR TO HER LIPS PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF MISS SMITH
BUT SHE COULD NOT SEE THE SMILE ON MR CRESSWELL'S LIPS NOR DID SHE HEAR HIM REMARK TWICE WITH SEEMING IRRELEVANCE THE DEVIL THE RIDER BEING CLOSER TO IT RECOGNIZED IN MARY TAYLOR'S BLACK SPECK BLES ALWYN WALKING TOWARD HIM RAPIDLY WITH AXE AND HOE ON SHOULDER WHISTLING MERRILY
WHY SHOULD NOT HE GO BACK TOO
AND EACH AT TIMES WONDERED IN PAINFUL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IF THE OTHER CARED
SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS A SIDE-WORLD NOT AN UNDER-WORLD
I WAS A CHILD
WHY I THOUGHT SAID MRS GREY THAT YOU SOUTHERNERS RATHER DISAPPROVED--OR AT LEAST MR CRESSWELL INCLINED HIS HEAD COURTEOUSLY
SHE HAD DREAMED THAT SHE WOULD HELP--UNKNOWN UNSEEN--AND PERHAPS SHE HAD HELPED A LITTLE THROUGH MRS VANDERPOOL
IT WAS HER DUTY HER HERITAGE
THEN THERE WAS ZORA
IT'S A MISTAKE HE SUPPLEMENTED
GOD'S SORT MRS VANDERPOOL--NOT THE SORT THAT THINK OF THE WORLD AS ARRANGED FOR THEIR EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT AND COMFORT WELL I DO WANT TO COUNT MISS SMITH BENT FORWARD--NOT A BEAUTIFUL POSE BUT EARNEST
WITHOUT A WORD SHE SLIPPED BEHIND THE PILLARS AND RAN DOWN AMONG THE OAKS AND SAUNTERED OUT UPON THE BIG ROAD
THE SUN BEHIND THE SWAMP WAS CRIMSONING THE WORLD
THE POWER WILL BE DELEGATED TO A SINGLE WHITE SUPERINTENDENT THE VERTICAL LINE IN CAROLINE WYNN'S FOREHEAD BECAME PRONOUNCED
THE EDUCATION OF ALWYN 218 TWENTY-FIVE
BLES KEPT LOOKING AT THE SKIES
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS THE SENATOR READ THE CLIPPING
AWFULLY BUSY HE SAID BUT I'VE BEEN READING UP ON THE NEGRO PROBLEM SINCE YOU MENTIONED THE MATTER TO ME LAST WEEK MR CRESSWELL AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND IT THOROUGHLY
EVERYBODY SEEMED CRANING AND LISTENING AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMBARRASSMENT AND A SENSE OF HALF-VEILED HOSTILITY IN THE AIR
I CREEPS IN MONGST THE DREAMS
IN THE DEPTHS OF MRS VANDERPOOL'S HEART SOMETHING STRANGE--NOT NEW BUT VERY OLD--STIRRED
HE WAS IRRITATED WITH THIS DEVILISH NEGRO PROBLEM
HE WAS KEPT WAITING A FEW MOMENTS WHILE SENATOR SMITH THE CHAIRMAN AND ONE OTHER MEMBER OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE HAD A WORD
SOME COMPROMISE WAS IMPERATIVE WHICH WOULD SAVE HER THE PLEASURE OF MR CRESSWELL'S COMPANY AND AT THE SAME TIME LEAVE OPEN A WAY OF FULFILLING THE WORLD'S DUTY TO THIS BLACK BOY
THEN SHE WENT UP TO HER MIRROR AND LOOKED LONG AND KNEW
IT WILL RUIN THE PLANS OF THE COMBINE TO PUT THIS AMENDED CHILD LABOR BILL THROUGH
THREE IN ALL--TWO WHITE AND ONE COLORED AND WILL THEY ALL BE REPRESENTED YES OF COURSE MRS CRESSWELL
SHE'LL THINK I HAVE SIMPLY GONE FOR A LONG WALK AND SOON THEY WERE SPEEDING DOWN THE SILENT ROAD BREATHING THE PERFUME OF THE PINES
BUT IF SHE WERE ESPECIALLY INVITED
CRESSWELL WATCHED HIM UNCOMFORTABLY AS HE RODE AWAY AND AGAIN A FEELING OF DOUBT STIRRED WITHIN HIM
BUT EVEN IF THEY DO ALLY THEMSELVES OUR WAY IS EASY
AN ELECTRIC TICKER WAS DRUMMING AWAY IN ONE CORNER A TELEPHONE RINGING ON THE DESK AND MESSENGER BOYS HOVERED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AND RACED TO AND FRO
WITH A QUICK BOUND SHE ALMOST FELL INTO THE FIRST ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
HE AROSE STARTLED QUICKLY GATHERED HIS BUNDLE AND LOOKED AROUND HIM
SHE HAD FELT AN INCONQUERABLE AVERSION FOR THE EVIL HAG
THE SPECTACLED WHITE MAN LEANED OVER TO STILLINGS
AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE--SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS--SIR JAMES CREIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CREIGHTON MR AND MRS VANDERPOOL MR HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MR CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY--A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
HER MOTHER IS BAD
SHE DID NOT ANALYZE IT
THE GLOWING WARMTH OF THIS CLOTH OF COTTON CAUGHT THE EYE OF BLES AND HE BOUGHT THE GOWN FOR A DOLLAR AND A HALF
THE WEAVING OF THE SILVER FLEECE 182 TWENTY-ONE
BLES FORGOT THE MAN
NO DARK MAN EVER ENTERED THEIR HOUSE
JEWELS YOU KNOW DEAR WERE NEVER MEANT FOR WHITE FOLK
DO YOU GO TO SCHOOL SHE INQUIRED OF THE BLACK BOY WHO HELD THE HORSE HER MIEN SYMPATHETIC AND INTERESTED
AND HERE AM I ALMOST HELPLESS
WE'D BETTER WAIT MISS SMITH STARTED UP AT THE TIMID KNOCKING AND RUBBED HER EYES
MEANTIME HER BRAIN WAS BUSY
SHE STOOD TALL AND STILL AND THE LITTLE GOLDEN-HAIRED GIRL STILL SOBBED IN HER GOWN
THE NEW YOUNG PHYSICIAN RECOMMENDED ZORA'S INFIRMARY AS THE ONLY NEAR PLACE THAT OFFERED A CHANCE FOR THE CHILD'S RECOVERY
BY LEGAL RIGHT IT WAS HERS BUT SHE KNEW HE WOULD CLAIM HALF TREATING HER LIKE A MERE TENANT
I I KNOW YOU DID LAUGHED THE SENATOR BUT THE JUDGE GOT ORDERS FROM HIGHER UP SHREWD MR TEERSWELL REMARKED MISS WYNN SAGELY
THE OPPRESSION AND FEAR OF THE SWAMP REDOUBLED IN MARY TAYLOR
SHE HEARD NO SOUND BEHIND HER BUT KNEW HE WAS THERE AND BRACED HERSELF
BUT THERE WAS A WHITE MAN WAS HE WHITE AND A BLACK WOMAN
CULTURE AND--SOME MASSES AT LEAST--WERE NOT TO BE LINKED
IT SEEMED TO HER TOO AWFUL FOR THIS FOOLISH FELLOW THUS TO THROW HIMSELF AWAY
BUT PERHAPS TOO SHREWD
THEN SHE SAID DREAMILY
YET HOW SHOULD SHE DO IT
SHE WANTED TO RUN AND DANCE AND SING BUT BLES WANTED ZORA THIS TIME SHE HEARD THE CALL BUT DID NOT HEED IT
THIRD PLACE WHITE FOLKS WON'T LOW IT
THIS LAND HERE AS I HAVE SAID IS THE RICHEST AROUND
SUCH MEN COULD NEVER THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
I DON'T LIKE TO WORK SHE MUSED
ALWYN WANTED MRS CRESSWELL'S JUDGMENT AND ADVICE
NEVER KNOW HOW SHE WORKED AND PLANNED SAVE PERHAPS AT LAST IN THAT SUPREME MOMENT AS SHE PASSED HER SOUL WOULD CRY TO HIS REDEEMED AND HE WOULD UNDERSTAND
THINK OF IT
SHE SEIZED A SOFT BROAD-BRIMMED HAT AND UMBRELLA AND WALKED OUT
WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU DOING HERE?--SLEEPING WHEN YOU OUGHT TO BE AT WORK
SHE FELT IN TOUCH EVEN IF DIMLY AND SLIGHTLY WITH GREAT INDUSTRIAL MOVEMENTS AND SHE FELT TOO LIKE A DISCERNING PIONEER IN PHILANTHROPY
THEN CAME ZORA'S LETTER SIMPLE AND BRIEF BUT BREATHING YOUTH AND STRENGTH OF PURPOSE
JOHN TAYLOR HAD PROSPERED SINCE SUMMER
HE HAD NEGLECTED HER
IT'S WRONG THROUGH AND THROUGH
HE PURPOSED GOING INTO BUSINESS NEITHER FOR HIS OWN HEALTH NOR FOR THE HEALING OR CLOTHING OF THE PEOPLES BUT TO APPLY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD'S NAKEDNESS AND OF BLACK MEN'S TOIL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO BRING HIMSELF WEALTH
TURNING HE GALLOPED BACK TO TOWN
IT WILL COST YOU FIFTY DOLLARS AN ACRE HE SAID FINALLY
THE OBVIOUS STEP OF COURSE WOULD BE TO SET HIM AT WORK
COULD I HELP SHE ASKED ALMOST TIMIDLY
OF COURSE HE CONTINUED YOU'RE NORTHERN BORN AND YOU HAVE BEEN A TEACHER IN THIS SCHOOL AND FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM US IN SOME WAYS
MISS TAYLOR WAS ON HER MORNING WALK WHEN SHE SAW HIM SPINNING DOWN THE ROAD AND BOTH EXPRESSED SURPRISE AND PLEASURE AT THE MEETING
THE SHRIEK OF THE MUSIC WAS DROWNED BENEATH THE THUNDER OF STAMPING FEET
I COURT THE MEETING AND SEEING
THE DEVIL DANCED IN HIS VEINS AND BURNED IN HIS FOREHEAD
IT ROSE SHADOWY THERE IN THE PALE CONCOURSE SWAYING IN GHOSTLY BREEZES
THE WHITE MAN RAISED A CRADLE TO DASH IT INTO THE FLAMES
AND WITH GOOD CROPS FOR THREE YEARS WE'D BE ALL RIGHT
HELLO JACK WHAT'S THIS AND HE PEERED AT MRS CRESSWELL WHO SHRANK BACK
WHY HAD SHE ASKED FOR HER
BANG WHO'S THAT IT'S ME LET'S RUSH THROUGH AND FIRE THE HOUSE AND LEAVE A PA'CEL OF NIGGERS BEHIND TO SHOOT YOUR LIGHTS OUT
INDEED--ALTHOUGH HE WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT--HE WAS GETTING LONESOME HOMESICK AMID THE MYRIAD MEN OF A BUSY CITY
THEY SAT DOWN AND TALKED OF GENERALITIES
SHE SAT IN HER OFFICE LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE LAND
BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD SHE FOUND HERSELF ALL AT ONCE INTENTLY LISTENING
I KNEW IT
MRS CRESSWELL WALKED SLOWLY TO THE DOOR AND STEPPED OUT
HE LAID HIS HAND A MOMENT LIGHTLY UPON HER HEAD
YES--HE'S FAIR HE WOULDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LITTLE GIRL THAT DID WRONG WHEN SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS WRONG HER FACE LIGHTENED AND SHE HELD HIS HANDS IN BOTH HERS AND SAID SOLEMNLY AS THOUGH SAYING A PRAYER
YES I THOUGHT SO
NOW I KNOW THE DISADVANTAGES AND WRONGS WHICH BLACK MEN IN THIS LAND ARE SUFFERING
SHE CONSIDERED THE MATTER A MOMENT
SHE SAW HOW HIGH AND CLEAR A LIGHT SARAH SMITH FOR THIRTY YEARS AND MORE HAD CARRIED BEFORE THEM
WITH THE VEILING DEATH HAD COME INTO HER HEART
I AM SURE MISS SMITH DOES NOT MEAN QUITE ALL SHE SAYS--SHE IS TIRED AND NERVOUS
ONLY YONDER TO THE EASTWARD LAY THE WAY OUT
THEN SHE RUSHED BACK BURSTING INTO THE ROOM
COLONEL CRESSWELL HAD PREVENTED THE TOLLIVER LAND SALE ONLY TO BE INVEIGLED HIMSELF INTO ZORA'S SCHEME WHICH NOW BEGAN TO WORRY HIM
YOU REMEMBER OUR VISIT TO SENATOR SMITH YES WELL IT GOT THE JUDGE HIS REAPPOINTMENT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD HE DESERVED IT DIDN'T HE I DESERVED IT SHE SAID LUXURIOUSLY HUGGING HER KNEE AND SMILING
BUT HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND HE TRIED AGAIN
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD FOUND THIS COMPROMISE AND SHE WROTE MRS GREY SUGGESTING A CHAIN OF ENDOWED NEGRO SCHOOLS UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF TRUSTEES COMPOSED OF NORTHERN BUSINESS MEN AND LOCAL SOUTHERN WHITES
A SMOOTH GREEN LAWN AND BEDS OF FLOWERS A VISTA OF BROWN FIELDS AND THE DARK LINE OF WOOD BEYOND
AT A SIDE ENTRANCE LIQUOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON SALE--MEN WERE DRINKING AND WOMEN TOO
THEY WERE TOILING FOR MEN
SHE SWEPT BETWEEN THE COUPLE LIKE A GUST GRIPPING THE CHILD'S ARM TILL SHE PALED AND ALMOST WHIMPERED
ZORA SAT SLOWLY DOWN AS HE GOT UP AND LEFT
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S ACTUALLY SLATED FOR THE PLACE HE'S SURE OF IT UNLESS SOMETHING TURNS UP WELL WHO'D HAVE DREAMED IT TEERSWELL MIXED ANOTHER STIFF DRAM
HER DREAM HAD BEEN A POST-GRADUATE COURSE AT BRYN MAWR
THEN HE AROSE
SIX COTTON THE CRY OF THE NAKED WAS SWEEPING THE WORLD
DO YOU THINK THE PLANTATION SYSTEM CAN BE MAINTAINED WITHOUT LABORERS
ZORA DID NOT MOVE
I BEG YOUR PARDON--DO SIT DOWN--I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS ONE EASIER
WE NEED THE POLITICAL STRENGTH OF THE SOUTH SAID EASTERLY
HE WAS CERTAIN HE KNEW THE TEACHERS OF ALL THE WHITE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY
WHAT TIME MEET US AT THE WILLARD BY NINE
AND HIGGINS YOU SCAMP--AH MR SANDERS--WELL GENTLEMEN AND LADIES THIS SURE IS GWINE TO BE A GOOD COTTON SEASON
ZORA APPEARED TO HER IN A NEW AND GLORIFIED LIGHT--A VIGOROUS SELF-SACRIFICING WOMAN
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE PUT IT IN JUST THAT WAY BUT THE VISION CAME VERY CLOSE TO SPELLING HEAVEN TO HER MIND
ALONG THE PIKE HE FLEW AND UP THE PLANTATION ROADS
AND THEN SHE CONTINUED I TELEPHONED THE JUDGE'S WIFE THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE HER ON A MATTER OF URGENT BUSINESS
THAT IMPUDENT NEGRO ALL NIGHT SHE DREAMED AND ALL DAY,--ESPECIALLY WHEN TRIM AND IMMACULATE SHE SAT IN HER CHAIR AND LOOKED DOWN UPON FIFTY DARK FACES--AND UPON ZORA
SLOWLY BUT WITH INFINITE PATIENCE SHE BROKE ONE STRAND AFTER ANOTHER OF THE BARBED-WIRE FENCING WATCHING THE WHILE THE SUN GROW GREAT AND CRIMSON AND DIE AT LAST IN MIGHTY SPLENDOR BEHIND THE DIMMER WESTWARD FORESTS
IT WAS THE CHRISTMAS--NOT CHRISTMAS-TIDE OF THE NORTH AND WEST BUT CHRISTMAS OF THE SOUTHERN SOUTH
THAT IS THE TROUBLE WITH YOU NEGROES
SUPPOSE AFTER ALL THIS GREY GIFT--BUT SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH SHARPLY JUST AS A WET SPLASH OF RAIN STRUCK UPON HER FOREHEAD
A SINGLE SELF AS AN END IS AND OUGHT TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
THEY HAD ARRIVED--THEY WERE MEN--THEY FILLED HIS MIND'S IDEAL--HE FELT LIKE GOING UP TO THEM AND GRASPING THEIR HANDS AND SAYING AT LAST BROTHER AH IT WAS GOOD TO FIND ONE'S DREAMS WALKING IN THE LIGHT IN FLESH AND BLOOD
SHE COULD NOT HELP BUT THINK THAT IN MOST OTHER THINGS THEY WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM HER AS IN COLOR
I HAVE COME FOR A MORTGAGE
AT THE SAME TIME MARY TAYLOR HAD COME TO SOME OTHER DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS
WHICH IS BETTER TO BE CRUSHED BY THE TRUST OR TO ESCAPE AT THEIR EXPENSE EVEN IF THAT ESCAPE INVOLVES UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTIONS ON THE PART OF ONE OF THEM
HE HASTENED TOWARD THE CRESSWELL MANSION AND GLANCED ANXIOUSLY UP THE ROAD
ONE LONG BROWN ARM TENDER WITH CURVINGS BALANCED THE COTTON
SHE GROPED FOR NEW WAYS TO TEACH COLORED BRAINS AND MARSHAL COLORED THOUGHTS AND THE RESULT WAS PUZZLING BOTH TO TEACHER AND STUDENT
ONE LEG WAS CRIPPLED AND HE HOBBLED PAINFULLY
SHE LOVED IT
THEN QUICKLY RECOVERING HERSELF SHE STARTED HASTILY TO WITHDRAW IT BUT THE WOMAN'S FINGERS CLOSED AROUND THE DARKER ONES AND MRS VANDERPOOL'S EYES BECAME DIM
YOU NASTY BRUTE THIRTY-TWO ZORA'S WAY ZORA WAS LOOKING ON HER WORLD WITH THE KEENER VISION OF ONE WHO BLIND FROM VERY SEEING CLOSES THE EYES A SPACE AND LOOKS AGAIN WITH WIDER CLEARER VISION
HE GLANCED FURTIVELY BACKWARD AND HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT BOUND
AND YET THEY SHOULD NOT KILL HER
IT MATTERED NOT WHAT THE PROVOCATION WHAT THE DESPERATE CAUSE
WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
A DEBATING CLUB--OLDEST IN THE CITY
THE DREAMS SHE CRIED
THE SICKENING THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS TRUE
THEN MR MAXWELL HAS TEN THOUSAND ACRES AND MR TOLLIVER A THOUSAND MISS TAYLOR WROTE RAPIDLY
SHE SAW RUIN AHEAD--TO THINK OF A BLACK GIRL TAKING A PRIZE AT AN ALL-SOUTHERN ART EXHIBIT
SO WAS HER BROTHER ONLY DIFFERENTLY
HE GLANCED AT MISS WYNN BESIDE HIM THERE IN THE DIMLY LIGHTED PARLOR
WOULD ROB BECOME A TENANT WHEN SHE ASKED
ZORA STARTED FORWARD
SANE FOLK FORGET
SHE POINTED TOWARD THE CRESSWELL OAKS AND HE TURNED AWAY
ABRUPTLY THERE CAME A PEREMPTORY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
STRANGE IN NUMBER NOT IN KIND
WHERE SHALL I PUT THESE MISS SMITH LOOKED AROUND
ALWAYS HE HAD BEEN HOLDING HER DARK LITTLE HANDS TO LEAD HER OUT OF THE SWAMP OF LIFE AND ALWAYS WHEN IN SENSELESS ANGER HE HAD HALF FORGOTTEN AND DESERTED HER THIS VISION OF ELDER BROTHERHOOD HAD STILL REMAINED
IN THE QUEST OF THE SILVER FLEECE THERE IS LITTLE I WEEN DIVINE OR INGENIOUS
SOME LANGUID ASSURED SOUTHERN LADIES PERILOUSLY GOWNED WITH VEILED DISDAIN FOR THIS INTERLOPING NORTHERNER AND HER STRONG MIND
JUST WHAT IS YOUR PLAN ASKED TAYLOR QUITE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW
AUNT ELSPETH HE BEGAN ZORA AND I ARE GOING TO PLANT AND TEND SOME COTTON TO PAY FOR HER SCHOOLING--JUST THE VERY BEST COTTON WE CAN FIND--AND I HEARD"--HE HESITATED,--"I HEARD YOU HAD SOME WONDERFUL SEED YES SHE MUMBLED I'SE GOT THE SEED--I'SE GOT IT--WONDER SEED SOWED WID THE THREE SPELLS OF OBI IN THE OLD LAND TEN TOUSAND MOONS AGO
THE GAUNT FANATIC TOWERED OVER HIM
I CAN PAY MY WAY HE RETURNED
I'LL GET HIS ADVICE AND THEN--I MEAN TO CONDUCT THE CASE MYSELF ZORA CALMLY CONCLUDED
WITH THE OTHER TEACHERS SHE HAD LITTLE COMMERCE
HE THOUGHT HER ASHAMED OF IT AND DELICATELY REFRAINED FROM GOING
MY WIFE HE GASPED
RIGHT ALWAYS TRIUMPHS
SHE DETERMINED TO SLEEP NO MORE
WE HEARD THE GREAT CRY IN THE NIGHT AND ELSPETH SAYS IT IS THE END IT DID NOT OCCUR TO MARY TAYLOR TO QUESTION THIS MYSTICISM
SAM STILLINGS HE EXCLAIMED DELIGHTEDLY AND WAS SOON GRASPING THE HAND OF A SLIM WELL-DRESSED MAN OF PERHAPS THIRTY WITH YELLOW FACE CURLING HAIR AND SHIFTING EYES
YET HOEING WAS MURDER--THE RUTHLESS CUTTING AWAY OF TENDERER PLANTS THAT THE STURDIER MIGHT THRIVE THE MORE AND GROW
BY A STREAK OF EXTRAORDINARY LUCK YOU HAVE GAINED THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF NEGROES IN AMERICA
IT WOULD CERTAINLY DO NO HARM AND IT MIGHT ELECT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT
THE BLACK BELT IS PRIMITIVE AND THE LANDLORD WIELDS THE POWER
IS THIS ABOUT THIS SHE ASKED POINTING ALTERNATELY TO READING AND PICTURE
THE NEXT MORNING HE RECEIVED NOTICE OF HIS APPOINTMENT TO A CLERKSHIP IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AT A SALARY OF NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS
YOU SURELY REMEMBER THAT AWFUL SCARLET DRESS
TAYLOR INSISTED THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE WAS CARELESSNESS WHILE THE MILL HANDS ALLEGED CRIMINAL NEGLECT ON HIS PART
SHE EXTENDED HER HANDS LANGUIDLY THEN FEELING SO UTTERLY TIRED LET HER EYELIDS DROP AND FELL ASLEEP
THE REVOLT DEEPENED WITHIN HER
MUST SHE LIVE FOREVER IN THIS AGONY?--AND THEN SHE HEARD THE DOOR BANG AND MR CRESSWELL'S GRUFF VOICE WELL WHERE IS HE?--HE ISN'T IN THERE MARY CRESSWELL FELT THAT SOMETHING WAS GIVING WAY WITHIN
SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ALL BUT SOME THINGS SHE TICKET"--THE TONE WAS HARSH AND ABRUPT
SHE WAS TO GET ALL POSSIBLE BUSINESS INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CRESSWELLS AND SHE WAS TO INDUCE MISS SMITH TO PREPARE FOR MRS GREY'S BENEVOLENCE BY INTERESTING THE LOCAL WHITES IN HER WORK
SHE DID NOT LOOK UP BUT KNELT THERE SILENT DRY-EYED TILL THE LAST RUSTLE OF HIS GOING DIED IN THE NIGHT
NOR WAS THIS WHOLLY HER FAULT
WE'D HALF PROMISED THAT TO CALDWELL HE OBJECTED
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT'S AWAY OVER YONDER HE ANSWERED
HER DARK ROUND AND BROAD-BROWED HEAD AND STRANGELY BEAUTIFUL FACE WERE POISED ALMOST DEFIANTLY CROWNED WITH A MISTY MASS OF WAVELESS HAIR AND LIT BY THE VELVET RADIANCE OF TWO WONDERFUL EYES
OF COURSE THE CLUB WAS AN AFFAIR WITH MORE OF GOSSIP THAN OF INTELLECTUAL EFFORT BUT TODAY LARGELY THROUGH HER OWN SUGGESTION AN ART TEACHER OF EUROPEAN REPUTATION WAS GOING TO LECTURE AND MARY PREFERRED IT TO THE COMPANY OF THE RACE TRACK
HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT HE ASKED
SHE WAS PERPLEXED AND UPSET AND STOOD HESITATING A MOMENT WHEN SHE HEARD A WELL-KNOWN VOICE
UNDER THE CARE OF THE LITTLE HOSPITAL AND THE GENTLE NURSE THE CHILDREN IMPROVED RAPIDLY AND IN TWO WEEKS WERE OUTDOORS PLAYING WITH THE LITTLE BLACK CHILDREN AND EVEN CREEPING INTO CLASSROOMS AND LISTENING
SHE HAD BEEN CALLED SUDDENLY TO TOWN WELL MY DEAR I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN THE GIRL WAS ANGRY
IN UNCHARTED WASTES OF SEA
SHE TURNED BACK
HE WATCHED HER SILENTLY TILL WAKING FROM HER DAYDREAM SHE ABRUPTLY ASKED
A LITTLE WAGON-ROAD ENTERED THE WOOD AND DISAPPEARED
SO THE CHAUFFEUR TOOK HER HOME
THIRTY-FOUR THE RETURN OF ALWYN BLES ALWYN STARED AT MRS HARRY CRESSWELL IN SURPRISE
WHO WAS HE TO STAND AND JUDGE THIS UNSELFISH WOMAN
STUFF YOU--AND NOT STUFF BUT EDUCATION WILL BE YOUR NATURAL THEME
I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF I UNDERSTOOD--IF I WASN'T MRS CRESSWELL GOT ANGRILY TO HER FEET
BUT THE WEEK WAS FULL OF PLANNING AND JOURNEYING AND TALKING
WAS THIS--"NELL'S
SHE WOULD HIDE IT IN THE SWAMP
IF SHE TOOK HIM UP TO HER OWN SITTING-ROOM THE SERVANTS WOULD THINK HE WAS DOING SOME WORK OR FETCHING SOMETHING FOR THE SCHOOL
YOU ARE A STRANGER HE ASKED PLEASANTLY AND BLES LIKED HIM
THE COTTON COMBINE THEN APPEALED TO HIM OVERPOWERINGLY--TO HIS PASSION FOR WEALTH TO HIS PASSION FOR GAMBLING
ZORA HE STAMMERED FORGIVE ME
THE NEXT AFTERNOON MRS CRESSWELL WENT DOWN TO A WHITE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT OF WHICH CONGRESSMAN TODD HAD SPOKEN WHERE A MEETING OF THE CIVIC CLUB WAS TO BE HELD
TWENTY-THREE THE TRAINING OF ZORA I DID NOT KNOW THE WORLD WAS SO LARGE REMARKED ZORA AS SHE AND MRS VANDERPOOL FLEW EAST AND NORTHWARD ON THE NEW YORK-NEW ORLEANS LIMITED
AND THEN--THE SILVER FLEECE THAT NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME BLES ENTERED ZORA'S HOME
WE'LL PLANT COTTON MILLS BESIDE THE COTTON FIELDS USE WHITES TO KEEP NIGGERS IN THEIR PLACE AND THE FEAR OF NIGGERS TO KEEP THE POORER WHITES IN THEIRS THE COLONEL LOOKED THOUGHTFUL
SHE HAD BEGUN TO READ OF THE LIVES AND DOING OF THOSE CALLED GREAT AND IN HER MIND A PLAN WAS FORMING
HE SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND A NEW FRIEND
IT'S THE LORD'S WORK
THE TARIFF WILL TAKE MOST OF THE SESSION OF COURSE
ALWYN WAS NEW CLEAR AND SINCERE AND THE BLACK FOLK HUNG ON HIS WORDS
THEY MIGHT GO IN THERE SHE SAID POINTING TO A DOOR
PERHAPS THIS SOP WILL DO FOR A LONG TIME ALWYN SAT MOTIONLESS WHILE THE SENATOR SAID NOTHING
THE OLD MAN ROSE PAINFULLY TO HIS FEET SWAYED AGAINST THE CABIN AND CLUTCHED OFF HIS CAP
BUT HE HAD NOT MEANT ANYTHING
SOME CONTINUED MISS WYNN TAPPING HER BOOT ON THE CARPET SOME--WAIT ON TABLE THE SENATOR SLOWLY PUT THE PAPER IN HIS POCKET
THEY WANTED AS FIRM A HOLD ON THE SCHOOL PROPERTY AS POSSIBLE
COLTON HE ASKED ARE YOU SENDING ANY OF YOUR WHITE CHILDREN TO THE NIGGER SCHOOL YET WHAT YELLED COLTON
HE SAID IT WOULD LOOK BETTER
WE HAD A HASTY CONFERENCE AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF YOUR CREDIT COLONEL CRESSWELL GREW PALE
EVERYTHING
WHEN SHE REACHED HOME STILLINGS WAS THERE AND THEY TALKED EARNESTLY
HE WAS A MAN WHO FROM THE DAY HE FIRST WHEEDLED HIS BLACK MAMMY INTO SUBMISSION DOWN TO HIS THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR HAD SELDOM KNOWN WHAT IT WAS VOLUNTARILY TO DENY HIMSELF OR CURB A DESIRE
BLES TOOK IT AND THEN REMEMBERED
WE'D TRY TO PAY THAT TOO COLONEL CRESSWELL CONSIDERED
NOW HAVEN'T YOU A GIRL ABOUT HERE WHO WOULD DO NO DECLARED HARRY DECISIVELY BUT HIS SISTER SUGGESTED THAT SHE MIGHT ASK MISS SMITH AT THE COLORED SCHOOL
WHY THEY'LL DO AS THEY PLEASE WITH US BOSH
OF COURSE MARY TAYLOR HASTENED TO ENCOURAGE THIS TURN OF THE CONVERSATION THERE ARE MANY POINTS ON WHICH MISS SMITH AND I DISAGREE BUT I THINK EVERYBODY ADMIRES HER WORK MRS GREY WANTED PARTICULARS
I DID NOT GIVE HIM THE CREDIT
HIGHER AND HIGHER THE BLACK STILL WATERS ROSE ROUND THE GIRL
BUT ONE DOESN'T EASILY GIVE UP GOOD SERVANTS
ALWYN SHE SAID SHARPLY I SHALL REPORT ZORA FOR STEALING
PERHAPS--WAS NOT COTTON STILL RISING?--A WHOLE ROUND MILLION
IT'S THE OTHER BALL CRIED MRS VANDERPOOL AND AMID LAUGHTER SHE ADDED LET'S GO IT WAS--THE OTHER BALL
HE WENT AND GREETED HER
NO BUT I WANT TO KNOW MRS VANDERPOOL GAVE A SATISFIED NOD
THE COST OF THE LAND THE BACK DEBTS OF THE TENANTS--NO POSSIBLE CROPS COULD PAY FOR THEM
SHE COULD THEN WRITE HER LETTER AND MAIL IT THERE
CANCEL HIS DEBT AND GIVE HIM TEN DOLLARS FOR CHRISTMAS COLONEL CRESSWELL GLOWED AS IF HE WERE FULL OF THE SEASON'S SPIRIT
ESSENTIALLY MRS VANDERPOOL WAS UNMORAL
CONSEQUENTLY SHE KNEW THE DINNER WOULD BE GOOD
THE WHITE SMOKER NOW HAD FEW OCCUPANTS BUT THE WHITE TRAIN CREW PROCEEDED TO USE THE COLORED COACH AS A LOUNGING-ROOM AND SLEEPING-CAR
THE MILL TRUST OF THE NORTH WAS AT LAST A FACT
THEN SUDDENLY A MAN SWUNG AROUND THE CORNER SWEARING IN BITTER RAGE
A TUGGING AND DRAGGING A DULL BLOW THAT SET THE CABIN QUIVERING
UNDOUBTEDLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR THEY WOULD CAPTURE HARRY CRESSWELL'S SEAT IN CONGRESS
IT WAS AN HOLY THING WHICH PROFANE HANDS HAD STOLEN
FOR LONG MONTHS HE DID NOT MEET HER UNTIL ONE DAY HE SAW HER DEEP EYES FIXED LONGINGLY UPON HIM FROM A THICKET IN THE SWAMP
ZORA WAS TROUBLED WHEN THE CHILD CAME
WHILE THEN HE HOPED FOR HIGH PRICES HE ADVISED THE FARMERS LEAGUE TO BE ON GUARD
BUT HE HAD COME PREPARED FOR ACQUIESCENCE
SHE WAS SUCH A WOMAN SHE WOULD HAVE BLES MARRY
THEN GRADUALLY THE PAIN OF INJURY STUNG HER WHEN THE BLOOD FLOWED FULLER
AYE AND HE MIGHT BE MARRIED TO MORE MILLIONS
THE DYING OF ELSPETH 171 TWENTY
THEN THE TALK WANDERED TO GENERAL MATTERS--THE RAIN THE TREES THE PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT AND INEVITABLY--THE NEGRO
WHY TAYLOR IT'LL KNOCK THE COTTON TRUST TO HELL DON'T GET EXCITED SAID TAYLOR JUDICIALLY
IN THIS WAY HE MADE HIS THOUSANDS
QUITE PICTURESQUE OBSERVED MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKING AT THE TALL SLIM GIRL SWAYING TOWARD THEM WITH A PILED BASKET OF WHITE COTTON POISED LIGHTLY ON HER HEAD
THE ARISTOCRACY
IT WAS LIKE A BREATH OF AIR FROM THE REAL WORLD THIS HOUR'S CHAT WITH A WELL-BRED GENTLEMAN
HE FELT ALL THIS AS THE STIRRING OF A MIGHTY FORCE BUT KNEW NOT WHAT HE FELT
WELL YOU'LL REPENT IT
VANDERPOOL DROPPED SENATE REFUSES TO CONFIRM TODD INSURGENTS MUSTER ENOUGH VOTES TO DEFEAT CONFIRMATION OF PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE RUMORED REVENGE FOR MACHINE'S DEFEAT OF CHILD LABOR BILL AMENDMENT
THE COLONEL LAUGHED FRANKLY TELLING COLTON JOHN TAYLOR'S PHILOSOPHY ON THE RACE PROBLEM,--HIS WILLINGNESS TO LET NEGROES VOTE
WAS CRESSWELL PLAYING A SHREWD GAME
NEW YORK YES
GEORGIA MA'AM AND WAS SILENT
A STATELY KINDLY OLD MAN WITH A TEMPER AND MUCH FAMILY PRIDE
WHO WAS PUTTING HER TO BED AND SMOOTHING THE PILLOW
DARK LITTLE HEADS AND HANDS BOBBED BY AND SOFT VOICES CALLED
BLES ALWYN HAD HURRIED THROUGH HIS DINNER DUTIES AND HASTENED TO THE OAKS
THEY LIVE ON NOTHING AND TAKE ANY KIND OF TREATMENT AND THEY KEEP WAGES DOWN
SHE KNEW THAT BLES HAD INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS WHO HAD URGED HIS PREFERMENT
WHEN COTTON ROSE AGAIN UP WENT THE NEW SPRING RENT CONTRACTS
THE WHITE BYSTANDERS HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM ENTHUSIASTIC AND ONE MAN--HE WAS A NORTHERN SPINNER--SPOKE OUT PLAINLY
CHEAP COTTON IS BUILT ON CHEAP NIGGERS
WHY MR CRESSWELL HOW CAN YOU CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING ELSE--NO NORTHERNER DREAMS MR CRESSWELL SIPPED HIS WINE SLOWLY
HE TOOK THE PAPER AND READ IT INTENTLY
WHAT A WORLD IT WAS AND AFTER ALL HOW FAR WAS THIS BLACK BOY WRONG
THEN GLANCING UP TOWARD THE CRESSWELL FIELDS HE SAW TWO WHITE MEN WATCHING THEM
TAYLOR STRAIGHTENED UP SWITCHED ON THE PORCH LIGHT AND TOOK A BUNDLE OF PAPERS FROM HIS COAT POCKET
WE'VE GOT WHIPS CHAIN-GANGS AND--MOBS IF NEED BE--NO IT'S THE NEGRO WHO WANTS TO CLIMB UP THAT WE'VE GOT TO BEAT TO HIS KNEES TAYLOR COULD NOT FOLLOW THIS REASONING
MRS
HER LETTERS INTIMATED VERY STRONGLY HER INTENTION NOT TO RETURN TO MISS SMITH'S SCHOOL
YET IF SHE STEPPED INTO THIS HOTEL TO REST EVEN WITH FULL PURSE SHE WOULD BE POLITELY REFUSED ACCOMMODATION
I'SE GOIN UP TO TALK TO OLD MISS SO AM I BUT I JUST SEE AUNT RACHEL GOING IN
SHE USED TO TEACH SCHOOL BUT SHE DON'T DO NOTHING NOW
IF WE ONLY HAD A MULE HE SIGHED
THERE WERE VARIOUS SETS OF FIGURES READ BY THE WORKERS
THE WOMAN WITH THE BABY ALONE RESPONDED
YOU HEAR ME AND HE DEPARTED FOR THE TRAIN
NOVEMBER CAME AND FLEW AND STILL THE UNEXHAUSTED FIELD YIELDED ITS FROTHING FRUIT
IT CAME OVER HER ALL AT ONCE THAT THIS ONE GREAT ALL-ABSORBING THING MEANT NOTHING TO THE GAUNT TIRED-LOOK WOMAN BEFORE HER
HE THOUGHT HOW SHE WOULD COMPLETE A HOUSE--SUCH A HOME AS HIS PROSPECTIVE FOUR OR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR COULD EASILY PURCHASE
I'M DRIVING ROUND THROUGH THE OLD PLANTATION HE EXPLAINED
SLOWLY BLES HITCHED UP
JUST THIS ONCE--HARRY--I BUT THE DOOR BANGED TO AND HE WAS GONE
BUT ZORA WENT ON
IN MOST MATTERS OF COMMERCE BETWEEN MEN HE WAS PUNCTILIOUS TO A DEGREE ALMOST ANNOYING TO TAYLOR
SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM AGAIN BUT DROPPED HER HANDS AND STARED DREARILY UP INTO THE CLEAR SKY WITH ITS SHINING WORLDS
SHE SAT WITH FOLDED HANDS AND THE OLD DREAMY LOOK IN HER EYES
IT MIGHT RAIN ONLY AN HOUR OR SO BUT SUPPOSE IT SHOULD RAIN A DAY--TWO DAYS--A WEEK
THEY TALKED OF THE CAMPAIGN AND VARIOUS MATTERS UNTIL AT LAST EASTERLY SAID
OF THE SKY WHICH ALONE STOOD STEADFAST AMID WHIRLING CHANGE
AND THE WHOLE STORE CLERKS AND CUSTOMERS STOOD AT ATTENTION FOR MISS TAYLOR WAS YET NEW TO THE COUNTY
HE WAS A TALL THIN HATCHET-FACED BLACK MAN CLEAN SHAVEN AND WELL DRESSED A LAWYER BY PROFESSION
THEY WERE WELL DRESSED AND WELL APPEARING MEN AND WOMEN WHO WALKED UPRIGHT AND LOOKED ONE IN THE EYE AND SEEMED LIKE PERSONS OF AFFAIRS AND MONEY
THE SILVER FLEECE SHE ECHOED IN BEWILDERMENT
HELENE WITHOUT HER CAP AND APRON WAS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR A LADY AND WHILE I WAS IN NEW ORLEANS A FRENCH CONFECTIONER MARRIED HER UNDER SOME SUCH DELUSION
HIS SOUL GROANED WITHIN HIM
BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT
SO FOR HARRY CRESSWELL THE DAY BURST FLAMED AND WANED AND THEN SUDDENLY WENT OUT LEAVING HIM DULL AND GRAY
IT DOES NO GOOD IT ONLY MAKES TROUBLE AND ENEMIES MRS CRESSWELL STOPPED FOR THE COLORED WOMAN HAD GONE QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM AND IN A MOMENT THE MAID ENTERED AND STOOD READY
SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND ENTER AND COME UP-STAIRS
SUPPOSE NOW--SUPPOSE HE SHOULD LOSE THE APPOINTMENT BUT YOU SAY THAT'S SURE UNLESS SOMETHING TURNS UP BUT WHAT CAN TURN UP WE MIGHT TURN SOMETHING WHAT--WHAT--I TELL YOU MAN I'D--I'D DO ANYTHING TO DOWN THAT NIGGER
BEFORE THAT MOTIONLESS FATEFUL FIGURE CROUCHED A SLIGHTER SMALLER WOMAN DISHEVELLED CLUTCHING HER BREAST
YOU--YOU--ORNERY HOUND OF HELL
SAY HE ROUGHLY OPENED UP I'VE GOT TO SELL SOME LAND AND THEM DAMN CRESSWELLS ARE AFTER IT
YOU ARE TRYING TO TREAT THESE FUNNY LITTLE MONKEYS JUST AS YOU WOULD YOUR OWN CHILDREN--OR EVEN MINE
HE WATCHED IT GREEDILY
THAT IS JUST MY ATTITUDE
HOW WHITE SHE IS
TO BE SURE HE WAS TALKING COTTON
BUT ZORA'S EYES DID NOT SEE HER
HE WAS FULL OF THINGS TO SAY OF MIGHTY MATTERS TO DISCUSS
SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MR CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
WITH A BOUND HE WAS BESIDE HER
ALL YON IS JASON'S WHAT SHE ASKED PUZZLED
BUT I MUST SEE THE SENATOR--COULDN'T I GO IN WITH YOU
I WANT YOU TO COUNT AND I WANT TO COUNT TOO
WITH QUICK INTUITION SHE SUGGESTED A SOUTHERN EXHIBIT WITH SUCH SOCIAL PRESTIGE BACK OF IT AS TO IMPRESS THE COUNTRY
A WISTFUL LONGING WAS STEALING INTO HER HEART
THAT GOING AWAY MAY MAKE OR RUIN HER
WHO EVER HEER'D OF SUCH WORKING LAND ON SHARES YOU DO IT FOR WHITE FOLKS EACH DAY WHY NOT FOR YOURSELVES ALWYN POINTED OUT
A WOMAN BRUSHED BY HER AND LOOKED HER IN THE FACE
THEIR PREJUDICES ARE CRUEL ENOUGH BUT THERE ARE JOINTS IN THEIR ARMOR
HOWEVER I'LL BEAR WHAT YOU SAY IN MIND CRESSWELL FOUND MR EASTERLY IN MRS VANDERPOOL'S PARLOR AND THAT GENTLEMAN WAS ANNOYED AT THE NEWS
IS SMOKING ALLOWED IN HERE IT AIN'T NON O MY BUSINESS HE FLUNG BACK AT HER AND MOVED AWAY
BUT I THINK I THANK THEM FOR IT I DON'T
CRESSWELL LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR HIS FACE HAD GONE WHITE AGAIN AND HE SPOKE SLOWLY TO STILL THE TREMOR IN HIS VOICE
ONCE A YOUNG BROWN GIRL WITH BOUNDLESS FAITH IN WHITE FOLKS WENT TO A JUDGE'S OFFICE TO ASK FOR AN APPOINTMENT WHICH SHE DESERVED
WELL WELL
WELL WELL
WHO IS YOU THAT DARES TO SET AND WAIT FOR THE LORD TO DO YOUR WORK THEN IN SUDDEN FURY YE GENERATION OF VIPERS--WHO KIN SAVE YOU HE BENT FORWARD AND POINTED HIS LONG FINGER
HIS NAME IS ALWYN SENATOR SMITH LISTENED AS HE OPENED THE LETTER FROM CAROLINE WYNN
ONE THING ALONE HELD HIM BACK
I COULD FIND IT ASLEEP SHE ANSWERED SKIPPING SURE-FOOTED ONWARD
DOWN IN THE SWAMP AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARED SPACE HAD RISEN A LOG CABIN
JUST WHAT SHE MEANT TO DO SHE DID NOT KNOW BUT SOMEHOW SHE MUST SAVE HER HUSBAND AND HERSELF FROM EVIL
HER SKIN WAS DARKLY TRANSPARENT AND HER EYES LOOKED OUT FROM VELVET VEILS OF GLOOM
IT WAS HERE THAT ZORA SAW HIM AS SHE CAME UP FROM HER HOUSE
MISS SMITH WAS MORE PATIENT WITH BLACK FOLK THAN WITH WHITE
BUT A NEW BOND HELD THEM
FULLY A HALF-HOUR LATER ROB HURRIED IN
A THICK GREEN RAG-CARPET COVERED THE FLOOR
BUT MISS SMITH SAT WHITE AND RIGID WITH THE FIRST OPENED LETTER IN HER HAND
FAR AWAY A FLAME AS OF A BURNING CABIN AROSE AND A WILDER LOUDER YELL GREETED IT
NOTHING
ALL THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE SHE FLITTED TILL GRADUALLY THE BLACK FOLK CAME TO KNOW HER AND IN SILENT DEFERENCE TO SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCE THEY GAVE HER THE TITLE OF WHITE FOLK CALLING HER MISS ZORA
WHAT A PRICE BLES LEANED ON HIS HOE AND CONSIDERED
HE STRODE FORWARD AND THE WOOD ROSE DARKLY GREEN ABOVE HIM
THINK OF IT!--THE BIGGEST TRUST NEXT TO STEEL WHY NOT BIGGER ASKED TAYLOR IMPERTURBABLY PUFFING AWAY
WE NEED EACH OTHER
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT HE AWKWARDLY RESPONDED TURNING SLOWLY AWAY
HE DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS THE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH
IF YOU DON'T HURRY YOU'LL BE LATE TO BREAKFAST SHE SAID WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE
THEY WOULD BE IN A HURRY TO RETURN TO SOME SOCIAL FUNCTION AND WOULD GIVE HER WORK BUT CASUAL ATTENTION
THEY ARE POOR WHITES
BEWARE OF DEM DAT WORSHIPS DEBBILS
HE HESITATED THEN IMPELLED BY SOME STRANGE POWER LEFT THE HIGHWAY AND SLIPPED INTO THE FOREST OF THE SWAMP SHRINKING YET FOLLOWING THE SONG HUNGRILY AND HALF FORGETTING HIS FEAR
THERE WAS BUT ONE PLACE THEN FOR THESE TWO SOULS TO MEET
MISS SMITH TURNING TO THE TEACHER AS I TOLD YOU THEY'RE COMBINED AGAINST US IN TOWN AND WE MUST BUY IN MONTGOMERY
IT WAS A FACT SO INSISTENT SO FATAL SHE ALMOST SAID AT TIMES THAT SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE IT
SENATOR SMITH REGARDED HIM AGAIN
WELL HE'S A FAITHFUL NIGGER AND NEEDS ENCOURAGEMENT
AND YET IT WAS NOT FOR IN THE CHILD OF OTHER DAYS ZORA SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DAWNING WOMAN
SHE WOULD PROTECT THIS GIRL
TO STAND IN THAT GREAT AUDIENCE AND SAY MY PEOPLE FIRST AND LAST
SIT DOWN
SHE PRESENTED A CARD
BUT IT WAS WELL-GLOVED AND SOMEHOW THE FANCY STRUCK HIM THAT IT WAS A COLD HAND AND NOT ALWAYS SYMPATHETIC IN ITS TOUCH
WHY NO HE RETURNED SHARPLY
IT WAS DANGEROUS--BUT SHE THREW A VEIL OVER HER HAIR AND OPENED THE DOOR
WHEN THE RABBITS TRIED THE TENDER PLANTS SHE WATCHED HOURS TO DRIVE THEM OFF AND CATCHING NOW AND THEN A PULSING PINK-EYED INVADER SHE TALKED TO IT EARNESTLY
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK QUIT
PERHAPS THEY TOO ARE SEARCHING FOR THE WAY AND THE TEARS BLINDED HER EYES
OF COURSE AFTER YOUR ART EXHIBIT AND THE SCENE OF LAST NIGHT MARY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO LIVE LONGER TOGETHER SHE STARED AT HIM UTTERLY AGHAST--VOICELESS AND NUMB
A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE BURST FROM HER LIPS
DON'T STIR UP NEEDLESS TROUBLE
LOOK LIKE A FOOL DO I HE MUSED
NIGGER WANTS TO TALK WITH YOU ANNOUNCED HIS CLERK
TEERSWELL NODDED AND SAID
SHE WAS RUMPLED AND MUDDY WITH FLYING HAIR AND THICK WALKING SHOES AND THE AIR OF BUSTLE AND VIGOR WHICH HAD CREPT INTO HER BLOOD THIS LAST MONTH
THEY WERE STRANGERS NOT ONLY IN ACQUAINTANCE BUT BECAUSE OF A CURIOUS COLDNESS AND ALOOFNESS THAT MADE THEM CEASE TO SEEM HIS OWN KIND
SHE KNEW THAT ZORA HAD REFUSED TO MARRY BLES AND THIS AGAIN SEEMED FITTING
IF THIS WENT ON THE DAY WOULD SURELY COME WHEN NEGROES FELT NO RESPECT OR FEAR WHATEVER FOR WHITES
THE BOYS TOUCHED THEIR HATS AND MURMURED SOMETHING INDISTINCTLY
SHE GLANCED TOWARD THE SWAMP
BUT NOW THE FIRE WAS THE FIRE OF THE WORLD
IT IS BERTIE'S
TO PUT THE MONEY IN A NORTHERN SAVINGS BANK AT THREE PER CENT INTEREST
SHE LOVED HIM AND SHE DELIBERATELY PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND LIFTED HER FACE TO BE KISSED
SHE HALF SLIPPED ON HALF WOUND ABOUT HER THE WHITE CLOUD OF CLOTH STANDING WITH PARTED LIPS LOOKING INTO THE LONG MIRROR AND GLEAMING IN THE FADING DAY LIKE MIDNIGHT GOWNED IN MISTS AND STARS
BACK IS SHE
STRENGTH AND AMBITION AND INARTICULATE LOVE WERE FIGHTING WITHIN HIM
LIFE IS SIN AND SIN IS SORROW
FOR THIS WAS THE IDLE TIME OF THE YEAR
I'LL PUT STUFF INTO HIM THAT'LL MAKE HIM WAVE THE BLOODY SHIRT AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THE BETHEL LITERARY--SEE
WELL WHAT ELSE SHE BEGAN AND THEN CHANGED
FAR UP THE ROAD SHE COULD SEE DOTTED HERE AND THERE THE LITTLE DIRTY CABINS OF CRESSWELL'S TENANTS--THE CRESSWELL DOMAIN THAT LAY LIKE A MIGHTY HAND AROUND THE SCHOOL READY AT A WORD TO SQUEEZE ITS LIFE OUT
BUT DO YOU KNOW I LIKE THE GIRL
MARY CRESSWELL DID NOT GET HOME UNTIL NEARLY DINNER TIME
THEY FORGET THAT ZORA IS NOT TO BE ANNIHILATED BUT STUDIED AND UNDERSTOOD AND THAT BLES IS A YOUNG MAN OF EIGHTEEN AND NOT A CLOD BUT THAT HE SHOULD DARE MARY BEGAN BREATHLESSLY
DIG IT--PET IT AND WE'LL SEE WHAT WE'LL SEE AND SHE DISAPPEARED
WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED ACRES IT WAS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT THIS LADY HAD BEEN BORN IN NEW ENGLAND
NINETEEN THE DYING OF ELSPETH RICH
BOTH FROM WHAT SHE RECOUNTED AND WHAT SHE COULD NOT TELL HE GATHERED THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STORY AND IT BEWILDERED HIM
THE BOY REMAINED SILENT
SHE MUST KNOW
THREE TIMES HE MURMURED AND HIS EYES BURNED INTO THE SHADOWS WHERE THE GIRL TREMBLED
AND ALL THE WORLD WAS SUNSHINE AND PEACE
SHE COULDN'T TELL HIM THAT HE WOULD NEVER GET ONE AT THE PRESENT RATE
HER WORK HAD RECEIVED SPECIAL COMMENDATION THAT AFTERNOON AND SHE HAD BEEN ASKED TO TAKE THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLICITY
A LOVED ONE A REGULAR ONE BUT SOMEHOW NOT AS THE REALITY AND PROSE OF LIFE UNLESS--SHE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT--HIS LIFE WAS ALL INDULGENCE
SHE WAS LONELY AND RESTLESS AND NATURALLY DRAWN TOWARD THE SCHOOL
IT QUIVERED TREMBLED AND THEN LAY CRAMPED DEAD AND STILL IN MASSIVE HARD SQUARE BUNDLES TIED WITH IRON STRINGS
ZORA 33 SIX
BLES LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE THEN SILENTLY TURNED INTO THE SWAMP
IT SEEMED TO ZORA THAT HIS DISCOURTESY WAS ALMOST FORCED
GIVE HIM A CHANCE AND I'LL WARRANT HE'LL DEVELOP ALL THE DESIRABLE TRAITS OF A FIRST CLASS OFFICE-HOLDER EASTERLY HESITATED
BUT WOULD SHE MAKE A SATISFACTORY MAID
HERE NOW IS STILLINGS WHO HELPED ON THE CAMPAIGN
HELEN WAS A CONTENTED WIFE AND MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS FITTED FOR THE POSITION AND HAPPY IN IT
BUT--WELL MRS CRESSWELL HAD LITTLE INCLINATION FOR SLUMMING
HE HEARD HER VOICE AS BEFORE FLUTTERING LIKE A BIRD'S IN THE FULL SWEETNESS OF HER UTTER MUSIC
IS THERE ANY WATER NEAR HE ASKED
HERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE
HERE I WAS PLAYING AN ALLURING GAME ON THE SIDE AND MY DEAR TOM TRANSFORMS IT INTO A STRUGGLE FOR BREAD AND BUTTER
THE OLD MAN'S A FOOL
WITHOUT A WORD SHE BOUNDED UP AND FLITTED OFF LIKE A BROWN BIRD GLEAMING DULL-GOLDEN IN THE SUN GLANCING IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES TILL SHE PAUSED ABOVE A TINY BLACK POOL AND THEN CAME TRIPPING AND SWAYING BACK WITH HANDS HELD CUPWISE AND DRIPPING WITH COOL WATER
JOHN TAYLOR HE ANNOUNCED TO SAM JERKILY THRUSTING OUT A CARD
I'M BUSY NOW DEAR BUT YOU GO UP TO YOUR LITTLE ROOM AND READ AND I'LL CALL ZORA QUIETLY OBEYED
AND TODAY AFTER HE HAD TAKEN MISS TAYLOR HOME AND SUPPED HE CAME OUT IN THE TWILIGHT UNDER THE NEW MOON AND WHISTLED THE TREMULOUS NOTE THAT ALWAYS BROUGHT HER
SHE KNEW WHERE THE FIRST LEAVES WERE BURSTING WHERE TINY FLOWERS NESTLED AND WHERE YOUNG LIVING THINGS LOOKED UPWARD TO THE LIGHT AND CRIED AND CRAWLED
WHAT WILL YOU SAY IN YOUR SPEECH SHE ASKED HIM THAT NIGHT AS HE ROSE TO GO
AND HERE IS THE GIRL BEAUTIFUL UNPROTECTED
THEN I WAS TEMPTED--AND FELL SHE PAUSED AND ZORA TOOK BOTH HER HANDS IN HER OWN
GO DOWN TO THE SOUTH WHERE WE WRITHE
ZORA GATHERED UP THE CLOTHES AND THINGS AND SHADED THE WINDOWS GLANCING THE WHILE DOWN ON THE STREET
ALONE IN THE GREAT BROAD SPACES SHE KNEW SHE COULD FIGHT IT DOWN AND COME BACK AGAIN COOL AND IN CALM AND DEADLY EARNEST TO LEAD THESE CHILDREN TO THE LIGHT
TEN O'CLOCK CAME AND ELEVEN
I WENT TO MR CRESSWELL AND ASKED HIM TO SELL ME TWO HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND
AND YET EVEN THEY PIQUED HIM AND SPURRED HIM LIKE THE SIGHT OF AN UNTRAINED COLT
MRS VANDERPOOL LAID ASIDE HER LITTLE MOCKERY AND MET THE SITUATION BRAVELY
YOU ARE TALL AND BEND LIKE GRASSES ON THE SWAMP HE SAID
YES SAID ZORA SMILING IN TURN
WANT TO SEE MR CRESSWELL
I GOES THERE SOMETIMES
ALWAYS--TELL--THE TRUTH SHE REPEATED SLOWLY
THE GOLDEN FLEECE--IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKENED
FIRST THERE'S ENGLAND--AND ALL EUROPE
SHE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED AT HERSELF
THE COTTON CORNER 162 NINETEEN
BY THE WAY WHAT DID THAT LETTER SAY ABOUT A SISTER SAYS HE'S GOT A SISTER OVER AT THE NIGGER SCHOOL WHOM PERHAPS WE KNOW
THE LAST BILL RAN TEN YEARS
BUT COLONEL CRESSWELL REPLIED
HERE I SHALL LIVE ESPECIALLY WAS HE ATTRACTED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE
BUT I HOPE YOUR SOUL WILL BURN IN HELL FOREVER AND FOREVER THEY PROCEEDED DOWN THE PLANTATION ROAD BUT ZORA COULD NOT SPEAK
EVERYTHING WAS GOOD ALL THINGS WERE HAPPY AND THESE TWO WERE HAPPIEST OF ALL
THEY WERE HER DREAM-CHILDREN AND SHE TENDED THEM JEALOUSLY
TO-MORROW THEY WOULD START UP-COUNTRY TO SOME BACKWOODS BARONY IN THE KINGDOM OF COTTON AND WORK TILL CHRISTMAS TIME
SHE LOOKED AT HIM DOUBTFULLY WITH SOME DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HIS HEARING HAD APPARENTLY SHARED SO LITTLE OF THE JOY OF HER TELLING
BUT ZORA WAS STRIDING UP AND DOWN THE HALLS THE BLOOD SURGING IN HER EARS
I WILLED HIS CHILDREN ALL THE REST EXCEPT TWO OR THREE LEGACIES
THE LOVE OF THIS BOY AND GIRL BLOSSOMING AS IT HAD BENEATH HER TENDER CARE HAD BEEN A SACRED WONDERFUL HISTORY THAT REVIVED WITHIN HER MEMORIES OF LONG-FORGOTTEN DAYS
ALONG BESIDE IT EVER RUNS THAT DARK AND HAUNTING ECHO
WELL SHE MUST AND WOULD HAVE THE PIN AND SHE STARTED FOR ELSPETH'S CABIN
HE OPENED IT
WHEN MRS VANDERPOOL SUGGESTED THE NAME OF MISS WYNN TO MRS CRESSWELL AMONG A DOZEN OTHERS FOR SPECIAL INVITATION THERE WAS NOTHING IN ITS SOUND TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE REST OF THE NAMES AND THE INVITATION WENT DULY
IN A FEW MINUTES HE HAD A DOZEN COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS IN HIS HAND
THEN SHE RETURNED TO THE OFFICE AND THREW MISS TAYLOR'S COMPLAINT INTO THE WASTE-BASKET
STANDING BACK IN THE SHADOW OF A FRONT WINDOW HE WAITED
EACH MAN IS GOING TO PROMISE US SO MANY DAYS WORK A YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK OTHERS TO HELP--THE WOMEN AND GIRLS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN--THEY WILL ALL HELP CAN YOU PUT TRUST IN THAT SORT OF HELP WE CAN WHEN ONCE THE COMMUNITY LEARNS THAT IT PAYS DOES YOU OWN THE LAND ASKED JOHNSON SUDDENLY
IT WOULD SURELY INVOLVE SOME OTHER IMPORTANT CONCESSION TO THE SOUTH MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKED UP AND AN INTERJECTION HOVERED ON HER LIPS
MANY MOVED FORWARD TO SAY A WORD TO THE SINGERS AND PLAYERS STILLINGS STEPPED ASIDE TO A GROUP OF MEN AND BLES WAS LEFT MISERABLY ALONE
YOU MUST FORGIVE ME SHE PLEADED PLAINTIVELY
THE PRESIDENT STOOD READY TO SEND HER HUSBAND'S APPOINTMENT AGAIN TO THE SENATE WHENEVER EASTERLY COULD ASSURE HIM OF FAVORABLE ACTION
SOME ONE IS ON THE STEPS
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND THE MEN LEANED FORWARD TO LISTEN
HE WAS TIRED
I--I MUST GO NOW GASPED ZORA AS THE CARRIAGE SWEPT AWAY
AT THE SAME TIME THE OPPRESSED BLACKS AND SCOWLING MILL-HANDS COULD NOT HELP RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE SAME INARTICULATE THOUGHT WHICH NO ONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO VOICE
SHE WAS SORRY FOR MRS VANDERPOOL AND SORRY FOR MISS SMITH
IT CAME FROM THE GREAT EASTERLY MILLS IN NEW ENGLAND AND WAS RED--A VIVID RED
THE COTTON CROP WAS SHORT AND POOR BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RAIN
MRS GREY WAS DELIGHTED
SATURDAY DAWNED COOL AND CLEAR
SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT MR CRESSWELL WAS TREATING HER ABOUT AS HE TREATED HIS WINE--AS AN INDULGENCE
SHE WAS TASTEFULLY GOWNED IN A WAY TO SET OFF HER BLONDE BEAUTY AND HER DELICATE ROUNDED FIGURE
SHE FORGOT HER WEAKNESS AND PICKING HER WAY ACROSS THE BRIDGE STOOD STILL AMID THE COTTON THAT NESTLED ABOUT HER SHOULDERS CLASPING IT LOVINGLY IN HER HANDS
THE GREAT DAY CAME
IT SEEMS THAT HE IS ENGAGED TO A WASHINGTON SCHOOL-TEACHER AND SMITH SAYS SHE HAS HIM WELL IN HAND
FORTHWITH MARY TAYLOR RECEIVED AN INTIMATION FROM HER BROTHER THAT VAST INTERESTS DEPENDED ON HER SUMMER VACATION
THERE SEEMED NO ANALOGY THAT SHE KNEW
A GREAT-VOICED GIANT BROWN AND BEARDED DROVE PAST THEM ROARING A HYMN
WOULD THIS WOMAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACT AND RESPECT HIM ACCORDINGLY
THEY'VE TOOK MY MULE NOW THEY'RE BURNING MY THINGS TO MAKE ME SIGN A CONTRACT AND BE A SLAVE
IT WAS SO GENUINE THAT IT NEEDED EXPLANATION
THE BOY THAT ENTERED THE DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH EMERGED A MAN A SILENT MAN AND GRAVE WORKING FURIOUSLY AND HAUNTING DAY AND NIGHT THE LITTLE WINDOW ABOVE THE DOOR
TOO MUCH GOES IN WAGES
SHE WAS RIGHT BEHIND HIM THE CENTRE OF A GROUP
THE BUNDLE WITH HIS EARTHLY TREASURE HAD HUNG HEAVY AND HEAVIER ON HIS SHOULDER
THERE AIN'T NOTHING BUT DREAMS--THAT IS NOTHING MUCH
OH YES--HE WILL SEE YOU IN A MOMENT BLES WAS RETURNING THE LETTER TO HIS POCKET WHEN HE HEARD A VOICE ALMOST AT HIS EAR
OUTSIDE HERSELF THERE WAS LITTLE IN WHICH SHE TOOK VERY GREAT INTEREST AND HER INTEREST IN HERSELF WAS NOT ABSORBING
DR BOLDISH SAT DOWN AMID A SILENCE A SHADE MORE INTENSE THAN THAT WHICH HAD GREETED HIM
SHE REACHED THE BACK LANDING JUST IN TIME TO SEE COLONEL CRESSWELL'S HEAD RISING UP THE FRONT STAIRCASE
CONGRESSMEN'S WIVES WERE RARE AT THE CIVIC CLUB
BUT ALWYN HIS OWN MIND FULL SPOKE FIRST AND RAPIDLY
MUCH CHILD LABOR AND THE LACK OF PROTECTIVE DEVICES MADE ACCIDENTS PAINFULLY FREQUENT
AND YET THAT WOMAN HAD SAT RIGHT HERE ALOOF IMPERTURBABLE LISTENING ONLY COURTEOUSLY
HE COOLED AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD FLARED UP
LIVING JUST COMES FREE LIKE--LIKE SUNSHINE STUFF
AND YOU MAY REPORT YOURSELF TO MISS SMITH TONIGHT FOR DISRESPECT TOWARD A TEACHER EIGHT MR
TAKE HER OUT TAYLOR PROMPTLY DIRECTED
WITH IT TOO CAME A COOLER CALCULATING INTUITION THAT FRANKNESS ALONE WOULD WIN HER NOW
THE GIRL WAS A WOMAN WELL-ROUNDED AND POISED TALL STRAIGHT AND QUICK
YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING
THE SCRAPING OF A FIDDLE AND WHINE OF AN ACCORDION
THE--DEVIL COMMENTED MR HARRY CRESSWELL TO HIMSELF
IT WAS WHEN ZORA CROWDING INTO THE VILLAGE COURTHOUSE TO SEE IF SHE COULD NOT HELP AUNT RACHEL'S ACCUSED BOY FOUND HERSELF BESIDE A GAUNT OVERWORKED WHITE WOMAN
HE WAS GROWING TO BE A BIG FINE BRONZE GIANT AND MARY WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM
CHILD
MISS TAYLOR LEANT FORWARD ALL INTEREST
WE SOUTHERNERS MY DEAR MRS GREY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VARIETY OF REPUTATIONS AND HE TOLD AN ANECDOTE THAT SET THE TABLE LAUGHING
ZORA MISS SMITH HESITATED AND GRIPPED THE BOOK WITH THIN WHITE FINGERS I'M AFRAID--I ALMOST KNOW THAT THIS SCHOOL IS DOOMED THERE LAY A SILENCE IN THE ROOM WHILE THE TWO WOMEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S SOULS WITH STARTLED EYES
I BEG PARDON--ER--MISS SMITH NO--I'M SORRY
MARY TAYLOR CRESSWELL STANDING IN HER MORNING ROOM AND LOOKING OUT ON THE FLOWERS OF THE SQUARE TOLD HERSELF THAT FEW PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HAD CAUSE TO BE AS HAPPY AS SHE
POOR THINGS SHE WHISPERED
LONG LONG AGO DOWN THERE IN THE GREAT PAIN-SWEPT SHADOWS OF UTTER AGONY WHERE EARTH SEEMED SLIPPING ITS MOORINGS
SEEING HIM WATCHING ALWYN SHE PAUSED IN THE SHADOW AND WAITED FEARING TROUBLE
SUDDENLY BACK BEHIND THERE IN THE DARKNESS A SHRIEK SPLIT THE NIGHT LIKE A SUDDEN FLASH OF FLAME--A GREAT RINGING SCREAM THAT CRACKED AND SWELLED AND STOPPED
NO WHITE MAN UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES WILL HELP ENFORCE SUCH A BARGAIN AGAINST PREVAILING PUBLIC OPINION BUT IF WE CANNOT TRUST TO THE JUSTICE OF THE CASE AND IF YOU KNEW WE COULDN'T WHY DID YOU TRY BECAUSE I HAD TO TRY
IS IT?--IS IT CHIRPED THE BIRDS
SHE TOLD HIM OF HER YOUTH AND TRAINING HER AMBITIONS HER DISAPPOINTMENTS
THE MEN IN POWER IN TOOMSVILLE NOW ARE NOT THE LANDLORDS OF THIS COUNTY
WHAT WOULD THE INTEREST BE SHE ASKED
BUT MASTER HARRY THEY AIN'T DOING ME RIGHT BOUT MY CABIN--I JUST WANTS TO SHOW YOU HE GOT OUT SOME DIRTY PAPERS AND STARTED TO HOBBLE FORWARD WINCING WITH PAIN
MARY A PAUSE THEN AN ANSWER
SHE WAS TALLER AND THINNER THAN FORMERLY DARKLY TRANSPARENT OF SKIN AND HER DARK EYES SHONE IN STRANGE AND DUSKY BRILLIANCE
THE PLACE OF DREAMS 53 EIGHT
WHERE YOU FROM GEORGIA WHERE'S THAT HE LOOKED AT HER IN SURPRISE BUT SHE SEEMED MATTER-OF-FACT
HE WHEELED TOWARD THE GIRL AND CAUGHT ONLY THE UNCERTAIN FLASH OF HER GARMENTS--THE WOOD WAS SILENT AND HE WAS ALONE
WAS THE CHILD BORN DEAD WORSE THAN DEAD THEN FAINT AND FAINTER WHISPERINGS
HAD ZORA THOUGHT OF THEM
SO IN A MANNER VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE HE HAD INTENDED TO ASSUME HE CONTINUED
NO ONE USES THIS ROOM ZORA CAUGHT HER BREATH SHARPLY BUT SAID NOTHING
HIS FATHER ST JOHN CRESSWELL WAS SIXTY WHITE-HAIRED MUSTACHED AND GOATEED
THEN AFAR IN FRONT A CURLED CLOUD OF WHITE DUST AROSE AND OUT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF GALLOPING HORSES
BUT SOMEHOW HE GOT THE DISTANT IMPRESSION THAT MISS WYNN HAD LITTLE FAITH IN TRUTH AND GOODNESS AND LOVE
HER BEAUTY WHILE NOT STARTLING WAS YOUNG AND FRESH AND FIRM
THINGS OF IMPORTANCE
LET'S THINK
HIS WORDS SNAPPED IN NERVOUS ENERGY AND RANG IN AWFUL EARNESTNESS
MISS TAYLOR WAS TIRED AND THE HASTILY SCRIBBLED LETTER WHICH SHE DROPPED INTO THE POST IN PASSING WAS NOT AS CLEARLY EXPRESSED AS SHE COULD WISH
THE NEGROES ARE NOT THEN VERY EFFICIENT EFFICIENT SNORTED MR CALDWELL
NOT IF SARAH SMITH COULD SAVE HER SHE RESOLVED AND STARED OUT THE WINDOW WHERE THE PALE RED DAWN WAS SENDING ITS FIRST RAYS ON THE WHITE-PILLARED MANSION OF THE CRESSWELLS
I TELL HIM HIS SOUL IS FIBROUS HE MENTIONED YOUR BEING HERE AND I THOUGHT I'D DROP OVER AND WELCOME YOU TO THE SOUTH THANK YOU RETURNED MISS TAYLOR REDDENING WITH PLEASURE DESPITE HERSELF
SHE WHISPERED
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT SHE SAID METHODICALLY FOR JASON WAS A BRAVE ADVENTURER I THOUGHT HE WAS A THIEF OH WELL--THOSE WERE OTHER TIMES THE CRESSWELLS ARE THIEVES NOW MISS TAYLOR ANSWERED SHARPLY
SHE RANG THE BELL ASKING THE TRIM BLACK MAID
DID YOU GET THAT NOVEL FOR ME HARRY?"--EXPECTANTLY REGARDING HER BROTHER
WHEN NO ONE THOUGHT
THE SENSE OF LOSS--OF UTTER LOSS--LAY HEAVY UPON HER
I'LL THINK IT OVER AND HE WENT OUT
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR SMITH SAID TO MR EASTERLY
NOW DODGING POLICEMEN NOW ACCOSTING THEM FAMILIARLY
NOT UNTIL I LEARN MORE
THE SOIL WAS VIRGIN AND BLACK THICKLY COVERED OVER WITH A TANGLE OF BUSHES VINES AND SMALLER GROWTH ALL BRILLIANT WITH EARLY LEAVES AND WILD FLOWERS
NO SOONER DID SHE SEE EMMA THAN SHE WAS SURE THAT THIS WAS THE IDEAL WIFE
AFTER THAT HE WOULD MARRY SOME ONE ELSE OF COURSE
NOW DEAR DON'T TAKE THIS TOO MUCH TO HEART
THEY'SE JUST A-DYING TO HEAR ME SO ZORA SPOKE SIMPLY BUT CLEARLY
THE SENATOR AMPLIFIED
EVERYTHING WAS READY BY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE DOOR OPENED SOFTLY
IN ONE MOMENT SHE LIVED IT ALL AGAIN--THE RED CABIN THE MOVING OAK THE SOWING OF THE FLEECE AND ITS FEARFUL REAPING
NOW HERE EVERY_THING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING
ZORA WAS PERCHED IN A TREE SINGING SOFTLY AND BENEATH A FAT BLACK MULE WAS FINISHING HIS BREAKFAST
TAYLOR EAGERLY INQUIRED AFTER THE CLOTH AND FOLLOWED THE LADIES TO ZORA'S ROOM ADJOINING MRS VANDERPOOL'S TO SEE IT
THE GREAT ROOTS TWINED IN ONE UNBROKEN SNARL CLUNG FRANTICALLY TO THE BLACK SOIL
HE CONSIDERED THE MATTER
HE MARVELLED AT THE SUBTLETY OF HER MIND AND SHE AT THE RELENTLESSNESS OF HIS
DREAMS--DREAMS--IT'S ALL DREAMS HERE I TELLS YOU BLES FROWNED AND STOOD IRRESOLUTE
THE FULL HORROR OF THE THING BURST UPON HER
I HADN'T NOTICED IT--BUT HERE'S MY AGENT THE SPECTACLED MAN ENTERED WITH A MASS OF DOCUMENTS
BUT DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY WADED UNTIL AT LAST TURNING THE ANIMAL'S HEAD WITH A JERK AND GIVING HIM A SHARP STROKE OF THE WHIP SHE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE ISLAND
HE HAD CALCULATED ON HER GETTING THIS LETTER YESTERDAY FORGETTING THAT THEIR MAIL WAS FETCHED ONCE A DAY FROM THE TOWN FOUR MILES AWAY
BUT--WELL THINGS MUST CHANGE COLTON ROSE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
HAD SHE HERSELF HUNG IT BEFORE HER SOUL OR HAD THEY HIDDEN TIMIDLY BEHIND ITS OTHER SIDE
MR BOCOMBE GOT OUT HIS NOTE-BOOK AND WROTE FURIOUSLY THEREIN
SHE STOOD BARE-HAIRED AND HESITATING IN THE PALE GREEN LIGHT OF THE DARKENED MORNING
IT WAS NOT EVERY ONE THAT COULD STAND STILL AND WELL
IF IT KILLED HIS OLD AND NEW-BORN DREAM OF LOVE WELL AND GOOD
WHO'S GOING TO TEND THIS LAND ASKED THE PRACTICAL CARTER
ON THE OTHER HUGGING THE BLAZE HUDDLED A FORMLESS HEAP WREATHED IN COILS OF TOBACCO SMOKE--ELSPETH ZORA'S MOTHER
BUT OUR RAW MATERIAL IS PERFECTLY SAFE--FARMS GROWING SMALLER FARMS ISOLATED AND WE FIXING THE PRICE
THE GIRL TRIED AGAIN
FIND SOME CRESSWELLS THERE--BIG PLANTATIONS--RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
HE SAW HER TWINKLING LIMBS A-DANCING AS ONCE HE SAW THEM DANCE IN A HALO OF FIRELIGHT
YOUR SERVANT MISTRESS HE SAID WITH A SWEEPING BOW AS HE STRODE TOWARD THE SWAMP
OF COURSE I'VE GOT MY EYES ON THE EUROPEAN SITUATION AND FEELERS OUT
HE WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT HE WANTED THIS WOMAN INTENSELY
MISS WYNN GATHERED BOOKS ABOUT HER AND IN THE DAYS OF APRIL AND MAY SHE AND ALWYN READ UP ON EDUCATION
THIS IS AN OFFICE COLORED MEN HAVE HELD FOR YEARS AND IT IS QUITE AMBITIOUS ENOUGH FOR THEM
SLIGHT STRAIGHT STRONG FULL-BLOODED SHE HAD DREAMED HER LIFE AWAY IN WILFUL WANDERING THROUGH HER DARK AND SOMBRE KINGDOM UNTIL SHE WAS ONE WITH IT IN ALL ITS MOODS
ITS ECHOING ANSWER SCREAMED AFAR AND THEY HEARD THE RAUCOUS VOICE OF ELSPETH BEATING IN THEIR EARS
I KNOWED DEM AFORE DEY WAS BORN THEY ARE--WEALTHY PEOPLE DEY ROLLS IN MONEY AND DEY'SE QUALITY TOO
AT THE DOOR OF HER HOME THEREFORE AFTER A WALK OF UNUSUAL INTEREST SHE SAID
THEN THE ONE PROTECTING INSTINCT OF HIS CLAN GRIPPED HIM
YET PERHAPS--WHO CAN TELL?--GOD HAS ESPECIALLY SET YOU TO THIS TASK
GOD NEVER KNOWED YOU AND THE DEVIL OWNS YOUR SOUL THERE LEAPT FROM HIS LIPS A DENUNCIATION SO LIVID SPECIFIC AND IMPASSIONED THAT THE PREACHER SQUATTED AND BOWED THEN FINALLY FELL UPON HIS FACE AND MOANED
THE COTTON ON HER HEAD SHIVERED AND DROPPED IN A PURE MASS OF WHITE AND SILVERY SNOW ABOUT HER LIMBS
AND WHO COULD FURNISH THAT ILLUMINATION BETTER THAN ZORA THE CALM METHODICAL ZORA WHO KNEW THEM SO WELL
SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO TELL HOW OUT OF THE DREAM HAD STEPPED THE DREAMER INTO THE REALNESS OF THINGS
STARTING NOISILY AND CONFIDENTLY AND THEN GOING MORE SLOWLY QUIETLY WARILY AS THE SILENCE OF THE FLAME BEGAN TO TELL ON THEIR HEATED NERVES
THE BALES WERE LOADED INTO THE EXPRESS CAR
THAT'S OFF IS IT OFF CRIED TEERSWELL DELIGHTEDLY
BUT--I'M SORRY SHE'S WHITE--BLES WHAT'S PURITY--JUST WHITENESS BLES GLANCED AT HER AWKWARDLY BUT SHE WAS STILL STARING WIDE-EYED AT THE PICTURE AND HER VOICE WAS EARNEST
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST HIM WELL SAID HARRY SLOWLY HE WANTS TO MARRY HELEN HIS FATHER GREW APOPLETIC
SEEK JESUS
HE EASED HER BURDEN TO THE GROUND AND THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER HE NERVOUS AND EAGER
YOU BRUTE
THE REPUBLICAN BOSS WAS TURNING TO HER FOR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
COTTON WAS MERCHANDISE
THE FACE OF THE TOWN BEGAN TO CHANGE SHOWING A RAGGED TUBERCULOUS LOOKING SIDE WITH DINGY HOMES IN SHORT AND HOMELY ROWS
TWELVE THE PROMISE MISS SMITH SAT WITH HER FACE BURIED IN HER HANDS WHILE THE TEARS TRICKLED SILENTLY THROUGH HER THIN FINGERS
WHERE WAS THAT BLACK AND FLAMING CABIN
WE'LL THANK GOD IT HAS BEGUN THOUGH THANK GOD ZORA REVERENTLY REPEATED
BUT HE DETECTED TONIGHT A NEW TONE IN HIS CLERK SOMETHING ALMOST AUTHORITATIVE AND SELF-RELIANT
DRINK SHE CRIED DRINK AND FORGET IN A MOMENT ZORA SPRANG FORWARD AND SEIZED THE BURNING LIQUID IN BOTH HANDS
THE DAUGHTER WAS TAKING HER COFFEE AND ROLLS UP STAIRS IN BED
LEARN THOSE HE SAID
NOT BECAUSE MR CRESSWELL DID NOT SHARE HIS WORK BUT BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE HAD NO WORK NO DUTIES NO CARES
BUT SHE THE OUTCAST CHILD OF THE SWAMP WHAT WAS THERE FOR HER TO DO IN THE GREAT WORLD--HER THE BURDEN OF WHOSE SIN BUT THEN CAME THE VOICE OF THE PREACHER
ANGER STRUGGLED BACK OF SURPRISE BUT BEFORE IT BURST FORTH SILENTLY THE COLONEL TURNED AND MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORD WENT SLOWLY INTO THE HOUSE AND SLAMMED THE DOOR
THE MOMENTS FLEW
B
B
WE MUST GET MARRIED--BEFORE CHRISTMAS ZORA HE PRESENTLY AVOWED NOT LOOKING AT HER
THE PAIN OF THE THIRST TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND
BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
HE WHISPERED TO THE JUDGE
MISS TAYLOR PAUSED
THIS EXPERIENCE AND THE PERSISTENCE OF MR TAYLOR INDUCED MR EASTERLY TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD THE LARGER PROJECT
SUCH A LOAD AS CRESSWELL'S STORE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
SHE TOOK ANOTHER SIP OF HER COFFEE AND TURNED THE PAGE
SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF HER NOW AND THEN BUT TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HER FOR TEN YEARS
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL MORNING SAID THE SCHOOL-TEACHER AND THE GLOW ON HER FACE SAID EVEN MORE
HE BEGAN TALKING ABRUPTLY WITH A QUICK SIDE-GLANCE AT MARY IN WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT A GLEAM OF SURPRISED CURIOSITY
HERE AND SHE THRUST A BILL INTO THE WOMAN'S HAND
HE HAD ALWAYS CALLED HER CHILD--BUT NOW IN THE INWARD ILLUMINATION OF THESE DARK DAYS HE KNEW HER AS NEITHER CHILD NOR SISTER NOR FRIEND BUT AS THE ONE WOMAN
ZORA BLES SHE CHOKED BUT HER VOICE CAME STRONGER I KNOW--ALL
FOR OVER A YEAR NOW I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE LAW OF THE CASE AND SHE POINTED TO HER LAW BOOKS
OUR ENTERPRISE SIR THEY SAID TO THE STRANGERS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS LOCALLY INVESTED
DO YOU EXPECT TO BUY THAT LAND FOR FIVE DOLLARS AN ACRE OH NO SIR
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LAST NIGHT A GREAT SPEECH I HEAR A FOOL SPEECH--THAT SPEECH COST HIM I CALCULATE BETWEEN TWENTY-FOUR AND FORTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS POSSIBLY HE'S SATISFIED WITH HIS BARGAIN POSSIBLY
WHERE SHOULD SHE RECEIVE HIM
WHEN FINALLY THEY WERE SETTLED IN NEW YORK AND SAT HIGH UP ON THE FIFTH AVENUE FRONT OF THE HOTEL GRADUALLY THE INARTICULATE QUESTIONING FOUND WORDS ALBEIT STRANGE ONES
NO LOVE IS WORTH A WHOLE LIFE ZORA TURNED AWAY WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
TODAY SEEMED DOUBLY GLORIOUS FOR BLES HAD SPOKEN OF THEIR MARRIAGE
FOUR TOWN JOHN TAYLOR HAD WRITTEN TO HIS SISTER
SHE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE
SHE GAVE MRS VANDERPOOL A SEARCHING LOOK
YOU SEE MAMMY'S PAPPY WAS A KING'S SON AND KINGS DON'T WORK
LET THEM BE A SORT OF NEGRO EDUCATION STEERING-COMMITTEE
SO HERE IT WAS CHRISTMAS TIME AND SARAH SMITH'S CASTLES LAY ALMOST IN RUINS ABOUT HER
I MISJUDGED YOU COLONEL CRESSWELL
FOR IT WAS GOD A COLD AND MIGHTY GOD WHO HAD GIVEN IT TO BLES--HER BLES
ONE WAS BLES ALWYN A TALL BLACK LAD
AND SO YOU CAN'T LEAVE NO'M HE SAY HE'LL SELL US OUT AND PUT US IN DE CHAIN-GANG IF WE GO
SHE WAS SURROUNDED WITH WEALTH AND ABOVE ALL SHE WAS IN THAT ATMOSPHERE OF ARISTOCRACY FOR WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS YEARNED
WHEREAS I WAS BLIND NOW I SEE MRS VANDERPOOL GAVE A LITTLE HELPLESS GESTURE
TAKE IT AS IT IS
BUT WHAT I WANT IS AN ESTIMATE OF YOUR LOWEST CASH PRICES CASH YES SIR CRESSWELL THOUGHT A WHILE
WITH THAT IN MIND HE HAD STRIVEN TO IMPRESS HER HOPING THAT SHE MIGHT TRUST HIS JUDGMENT IN LATER YEARS
HE BOWED AS MRS CRESSWELL LEFT AND THEN DID NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH BECAUSE IN THIS CASE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW
BUT I WANT BLES SHE PAUSED AND STARTED AGAIN
ZORA SAW THE THRONG FROM AFAR AND HESITATED
THEIR MANNER TOWARD EACH OTHER BY DEGREES GREW SHYER AND MORE THOUGHTFUL
DEY'SE GOOD BOYS DEY IS GOOD TO DE'RE OLD MAMMY BUT DEY'SE HIGH STRUNG AND DEY GITS FIGHTING AND DRINKING AND--AND--LAST SATURDAY NIGHT DEY GOT TOOK UP AGAIN
SHE DID NOT COME DOWN TO DINNER AND IN THE EVENING THE DOCTOR WAS CALLED
HE HAD FORESEEN
THE TRANSFER OF THE TOLLIVER LAND HAD NOT YET BEEN EFFECTED
SHE DID NOT PLAN TO STEP IN AND DEMAND A SHARE
HE FORGOT THE FRIEND HE WAS TO MEET
I DON'T LIKE IT DECLARED HARRY CRESSWELL TOSSING THE LETTER BACK TO HIS FATHER
I DON'T LIKE WORK--DO YOU MISS TAYLOR WINCED WONDERING IF THE GIRL WERE LYING AGAIN
HE DREW OUT HIS NOTE-BOOK
THE PEOPLE LAUGHED AND PUSHED
THE OTHER'S BROWS DREW UP
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME OUT JOHN ALL RIGHT WHISPERED TAYLOR
THE BREAKFAST BELL JANGLED
YOU KNOW STATISTICS SHOW DRAT STATISTICS MISS SMITH HAD FLASHED IMPATIENTLY
SLOWLY A SORT OF FATAL INACTION SEIZED HER
WE ARE GOING TO DEED IT TO A BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THOSE TRUSTEES ARE TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE ONES WHO BUY THE SMALL FARMS WHO'S GOING TO GET WHAT'S MADE ON THIS LAND ASKED SANDERS
THEN GRADUALLY HER INTELLIGENCE HER COOL WIT AND SELF-POSSESSION WOULD CONQUER AND SHE WOULD GO GRACEFULLY OUT LEAVING A RATHER BEWILDERED AUDIENCE BEHIND
THE KING HIMSELF AS A BLACK MAN ALMOST ROSE FROM THE TANGLED EARTH AT THEIR SIDE
ZORA CRIED HELEN IN ECSTASY
VERY GOOD
THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE BLACK VOTERS IN PIVOTAL NORTHERN STATES YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE IN REVOLT
THE DAY PASSED
MISS SMITH HOWEVER REMAINED PROVOKINGLY SILENT SO MISS TAYLOR ESSAYED FURTHER
WHY SHARPLY
HE WALKED HIS ROOM GRIPPING HIS HANDS PEERING THROUGH THE MISTY WINDOWS TOWARD THE SWAMP--RAIN RAIN RAIN NOTHING BUT RAIN
OH I BEG PARDON BUT MISS WYNN WANTED A WORD ON ANOTHER MATTER THE SENATOR TURNED TO MISS WYNN
UP FROM THE SWAMP LAND CAME THE CHILDREN CRYING AND MOANING
FROM A WHIRLING EDDY MRS VANDERPOOL WAVED AT THEM AND THEY RESCUED HER
HE HAD ACTED TOO CAVALIERLY IN THIS CIVIC CLUB MESS HE CONCLUDED AND YET HE WOULD NOT BACK DOWN
EVER MET HIM YES WELL--SO LONG JUST A MOMENT THE STATESMAN STAYED THE FINANCIER
KEEP HIM IN DEBT BUT LET HIM DRAW WHAT HE WANTS AUNT RACHEL H'M THEY'RE WAY BEHIND AREN'T THEY
LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
SHE FOUND THE NEGRO YOUTH QUICKER SURER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IN HIS ANSWERS THAN THOSE SHE QUESTIONED ELSEWHERE AND SHE GAINED REAL ENJOYMENT FROM HER LONG TALKS WITH HIM
STILLINGS WAS A TYPE
THEIR INTERESTS ARE IDENTICAL
I SHALL HOPE TO SEE YOU IN WASHINGTON GOOD-DAY MRS VANDERPOOL RETURNED ABSENTLY
ABRUPTLY THE AIR THE DAY THE SCENE ABOUT HER SUBTLY CHANGED
IT IS GOING FIRST TO PAY FOR THE LAND THEN TO SUPPORT THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL AND THEN TO FURNISH CAPITAL FOR INDUSTRIES JOHNSON SNICKERED
THEN WHAT
BLACK FOLKS IS WONDERFUL HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE MEANT
PANTING AND CURSING HE FLASHED HIS HUGE REVOLVER--"_BANG
WHEN THEY CAME TO ATLANTA ZORA STARED AND WRINKLED HER BROWS
BEWARE THE EBIL ONE HE SHOUTED AND THE MULTITUDE MOANED
SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED THE LONELINESS THE FEAR AND WILD RUNNING THROUGH THE DARK
HE SERVED THEM WITH DOG-LIKE FAITH ASKING NO REWARD AND FOR WHAT HE GAVE IN REVERENCE TO THEM HE TOOK BACK IN CONTEMPT FOR HIS FELLOWS--"NIGGERS HE APPLIED THE EPITHET WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN THE COLONEL HIMSELF COULD EXPRESS
WHAT'S A MAID WHY A WOMAN WHO HELPS OTHERS HELPS FOLKS THAT THEY LOVE
WELL LEAVE IT HERE AND I'LL SEE TO IT BUT YOU SEE SIR MISS SMITH IS SO METHODICAL
THEN BLES SAT DOWN BESIDE ZORA FACING THE FIELDS AND GRAVELY TOOK HER HAND
IN A MOMENT SHE HAD SLIPPED HER HAND AWAY AND WAS SCRAMBLING UPON THE TREE TRUNK
BUT IT DOESN'T DOES IT NO
YONDER GREAT BALES OF COTTON YELLOW-WHITE IN ITS SOILED SACKING PILED IN LOFTY DUSTY MOUNTAINS LAY LISTENING FOR THE TRAIN THAT TWICE A DAY RAN OUT TO THE GREATER WORLD
SHE WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH THE JOY AND ABANDON OF THE SCENE--LIGHT LAUGHTER HUGE GUFFAWS HANDSHAKES AND GOSSIPINGS
WHY HAD HE NOT KNOWN--NOT SEEN BEFORE
IT'S A RISK TAYLOR OF COURSE AND WE'LL LET THE OLD LADY TAKE THE RISK
COTTON IS GOING UP OF COURSE IT'S GOING UP
THE WHITE WOMAN SHRANK BACK
SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL AND SHE APPEARED TO BE FRAGILE
AND YET LOOK UP TO YOU SHE MURMURED
THEY WANT US TO REVIVE THE FARMERS LEAGUE HE FIERCELY DEMANDED
THERE EVEN CAME WHISPERS TO HIS EARS THAT HE HAD SOLD OUT TO THE LANDLORDS AND THERE WAS ENOUGH TRUTH IN THE REPORT TO SCARE HIM
DAILY THE DARK LITTLE CLOUD OF SCHOLARS ROSE UP FROM HILL AND VALE AND SETTLED IN THE WHITE BUILDINGS
WHY BLES SHE EXCLAIMED IMPETUOUSLY STARTING TO HOLD OUT HER HAND
MR EASTERLY WAS NOT AT HOME IN MRS VANDERPOOL'S PRESENCE
NEVER FOR HER HAD A FALL OPENED AS GLORIOUSLY
IF THE LATTER WHAT WAS HIS GAME
I THOUGHT I MIGHT PAY THAT DOWN AND THEN PAY THE REST FROM THE CROPS WHO'S GOING TO WORK ON THE PLACE ZORA NAMED A NUMBER OF THE STEADIEST TENANTS TO WHOM SHE HAD SPOKEN
BEHIND WHERE THE SUN COMES UP OH NO THEN IT AIN'T SO FAR SHE DECLARED
SHE TOOK NO HINTS AND GAVE NO INFORMATION AND WHEN ONCE HE HAZARDED SOME POINTED QUESTIONS SHE TURNED ON HIM ABRUPTLY OBSERVING ACIDLY
A MOMENT THEIR EYES LOOKED DEEP INTO EACH OTHER'S--A TIMID STARTLED GLEAM IN HERS
AN IMPUDENT NEGRO HE VOICED HIS DISGUST
THEN BANG
TODAY THEY LIVED FOR HER IN FLESH AND BLOOD
HE KNEW NOT WHETHER TO JEER OR WONDER
HER WORK TOOK BUT LITTLE OF HER TIME AND LEFT HOURS FOR READING AND THINKING
IT CAN EASILY MEAN TWO MILLION TO YOU IN FIVE YEARS AND THE OTHER PLANTERS THEY COME IN FOR HIGH-PRICED COTTON UNTIL WE GET OUR GRIP AND THEN THE QUIET QUESTION SEEMED TO INVOKE A VISION FOR JOHN TAYLOR
I WANTED TO GO IN THE TRAP--TAKE ME COAXED HIS SISTER
THE SECOND SPEECH WHICH ALWYN MADE AT THE BETHEL LITERARY WAS AS STILLINGS FORESAW A REPLY TO THE STINGING CRITICISMS OF CERTAIN COLORED PAPERS ENGINEERED BY TEERSWELL WHO SAID THAT ALWYN HAD BEEN BRIBED TO REMAIN LOYAL TO THE REPUBLICANS BY A SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR OFFICE
MISS SMITH EYED HER GRIMLY THEN SLOWLY STEPPED BACK
WE ARE GIVING THE SOUTH THE WASHINGTON SCHOOLS AND KILLING THE EDUCATION BILL IN RETURN FOR THIS SUPPORT OF SOME OF OUR MEASURES AND THEIR ASSENT TO ALWYN'S APPOINTMENT
MARY TAYLOR WAS PERPLEXED AND IN SOME INDEFINITE WAY AMAZED
I THOUGHT I WAS RIGHT
THEN HE STARTED
BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY--JUST ELEMENTARY WORK JOHN HAD MET THIS OBJECTION WITH HUMPH AS HE LEFT FOR HIS OFFICE
BACK SHE SANK WITH A SIGH AND LAY STARING AT THE CEILING--A GAUNT FLAT SAD-EYED CREATURE WITH WISPS OF GRAY HAIR HALF-COVERING HER BALDNESS AND A FACE FURROWED WITH CARE AND GATHERING YEARS
IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM TILL NOW THAT ZORA WAS SPEAKING BETTER AND BETTER ENGLISH
THE NEGRO PAPERS WERE QUIETLY SUBSIDIZED AND THEY BEGAN TO RIDICULE AND REPROACH THE NEW LEADERS
WHAT'S THIS STUFF ABOUT THE CIVIC CLUB HE BEGAN SHARPLY
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE SMITH WOMAN SUCH A SCARE THAT SHE'LL KEEP HER HANDS OFF OUR NIGGERS AND HARRY CRESSWELL RODE AWAY
BUT THERE ARE MORE--MANY MANY MORE--WORLDS ON WORLDS OF THINGS--YOU HAVE NOT DREAMED OF SHE STARED AT HIM OPEN-EYED AND A WONDER CREPT UPON HER FACE BATTLING WITH THE OLD ASSURANCE
HIS ANGER CHOKED HIM
WE WON'T WORK ANY MORE TODAY THEN CRIED ZORA HER EAGERNESS BETRAYING ITSELF DESPITE HER EFFORTS TO HIDE IT
THEN SOME ONE SLIPPED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS AND SOON WATCH-FIRE AFTER WATCH-FIRE FLICKERED AND FLAMED IN THE NIGHT AND THEN BURNED VIVIDLY SENDING UP SPARKS AND BLACK SMOKE
THE UPPER CLASSES OF NEGROES ON THE OTHER HAND HE STILL OBSERVED FROM AFAR
AND HERE BLES STOPPED AND MISS TAYLOR ENTERED
A TEAR WANDERED DOWN HIS BROWN CHEEK
I HEARD SOME RUMORS
SHE MUST SEND EMMA UP TO HELP AND AS SHE STARTED TOWARD THE SCHOOL SHE GLANCED TOWARD THE CRESSWELL OAKS AND SAW THE ARM-CHAIR OF ITS MASTER ON THE PILLARED PORCH
YOU WOULD BE SERVING IN A GREAT CAUSE
NOTHING SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY
WE ARE NOT GOING TO QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF THE FORM--THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE
WHIRLING THE MOB FLED TILL IT STRUCK THE ROAD IN TWO CONFUSED SURGING MASSES
THEY EYED HER RESPECTFULLY AND WITH ONE OF THEM SHE TALKED A LITTLE AS HE AWKWARDLY FINGERED HIS CAP
HIS CREDIT HAD PULLED THE THING THROUGH
IT IS UNINTERESTING MURMURED HER HUSBAND PREPARING FOR A NAP
I CERTAINLY WANT THESE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP AS FAR AS THEY CAN ALTHOUGH MISS SMITH AND I WOULD DIFFER AS TO THEIR POSSIBILITIES
SHE DID NOT STOP AT THE OUTSTRETCHED ARM OF THE CLOAKMAN BUT GLIDED QUICKLY UP THE STAIRS TOWARD A VISION OF HANDSOME WOMEN AND STRAINS OF MUSIC
NO I DON'T SUPPOSE HER SCHOOL IS
HE WAS TALL BLACK AND GAUNT PART BALD WITH TUFTED HAIR AND A COWED AND FURTIVE LOOK WAS IN HIS EYES
SOME TIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU SHE GLANCED AT HER WATCH IN SURPRISE AND AROSE HASTILY
BRING THE MONEY AND WE'LL FIX THE THING UP THE MONEY IS HERE SAID ZORA TAKING AN ENVELOPE OUT OF HER BOSOM
ZORA HE WHISPERED
ZORA SHE SAID SLOWLY I'VE BEEN GOING TO TELL YOU EVER SINCE YOU CAME BUT I HADN'T THE COURAGE
SHE WENT DOWN TO SEE HIM--HE MIGHT BE A CONSTITUENT--AND FOUND A SMIRKY BROWN MAN VERY APOLOGETIC
SHE SOMETIMES EATS WITH YOU--IS YOUR COMPANION IN FACT WHAT OF IT
IF YOU'LL HELP ME I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU STILLINGS AROSE AND CAREFULLY OPENING THE HALL DOOR PEERED OUT
THERE WAS NO PLACE WITHIN A MILE WHERE SHE WAS ALLOWED TO EAT
HE BELIEVED HE HAD DISCOVERED A DEEP-LAID SCHEME OF THE ARISTOCRATS TO CULTIVATE FRIENDLINESS BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS AND THEN USE BLACK VOTERS TO CRUSH THE WHITES
ALL HER BRILLIANT FANCY WOVE ITSELF ABOUT THEM
IT GAVE YOU NOBLE FRIENDS LIKE MR CRESSWELL HERE A RESTLESS STIRRING AND THE BATTERY OF EYES WAS TURNED UPON THAT IMPERTURBABLE GENTLEMAN AS IF HE WERE SOME STRANGE ANIMAL
TWO THOUSAND WOULD BUY A HALF DOZEN DESIRABLE TENANTS BY PAYING THEIR DEBTS TO THEIR PRESENT LANDLORDS
SHE LOOKED AT HIM WIDE-EYED AND SAID IN A VOICE HOARSE WITH HORROR AND LOATHING
WHO EVER HEER'D TELL OF SUCH A THING
SHE REALIZED HER MISTAKE AND PROMISED TO RETRIEVE IT DURING THE WEEK
MARY RETURNED TO THE OLD SCENES WITH MINGLED FEELINGS
GOOD LORD HE EJACULATED
AFTER HIS LAST INDISCREET TALK SHE HAD VENTURED DEFTLY TO REMONSTRATE AND SHE WELL REMEMBERED THE CONVERSATION
PERHAPS SHE ANSWERED
YOU CANNOT HAVE THE PRIZE SHE ALMOST SNAPPED
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN WITHIN THE GATES BEFORE AND SHE LOOKED ABOUT THOUGHTFULLY
THE MOB 364 THIRTY-EIGHT
NO--NO--I DO NOT THINK YOU DO MEAN THAT HE PAUSED AND THE ENGLISHMAN BENT FORWARD
LONG STRAIGHT OR CURLING ROWS OF PLOUGHERS PASSED BY WITH STEAMING STRUGGLING MULES WITH WHIPS SNAPPING AND THE YODLE OF WORKERS OR THE SHARP GUTTURAL GROWL OF OVERSEERS AS A CONSTANT ACCOMPANIMENT
SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY HE RAN
THERE CAME A LOUDER KNOCKING AND A VOICE
HE SAW THE HORSE COMING IN HIS PATHWAY AND STEPPING ASIDE IN THE DUST CONTINUED ON HIS WAY NEITHER LOOKING NOR SPEAKING
THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO TELL
THEY'RE BEGINNING TO PLOUGH UP THE LAND FOR THE COTTON-CROP HE EXPLAINED
HOARSE STACCATO CRIES AND PEALS OF LAUGHTER SHOOK THE OLD HUT AND AS THE BOY STOOD THERE PEERING THROUGH THE BLACK TREES ABRUPTLY THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A FLOOD OF LIGHT ILLUMINED THE WOOD
IT'S BUILT ON IGNORANCE THEFT AND FORCE AND I WISH TO GOD WE HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO OVERTHROW IT AND TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
PUT IT THERE SIR SAID HE
SHE LEANED BACK AND LOOKED LEISURELY AT THE HEADINGS
CRESSWELL SAT UP
DO YOU MEAN IT YES BLES WHY BECAUSE I AM SELFISH AND--SMALL NO YOU ARE NOT
WHEN LOVE WAS SHAKEN ALL THINGS MOVED BUT NOW AT LAST FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE SEEMED TO KNOW THE REAL AND MIGHTY WORLD THAT STOOD BEHIND THAT OLD AND SHAKEN DREAM
IT WAS SIMPLY SOME ONE NAMED STILLINGS TO SEE MR CRESSWELL
AND AFTER ALL I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET AS MANY TENANTS AS I'D NEED
YET WHAT IT WOULD BE AND WHAT SHE EXPECTED SHE DID NOT KNOW
ONCE BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT OLD MAN
GOD
GOD
I GOT A MARK OF NINETY-THREE WHAT!--AND NO APPOINTMENT THE SENATOR WAS INCREDULOUS
NO OWNED INDEED THEN THERE WAS A HITCH
THAT'S IN CIVIL-SERVICE AND YOU MUST TAKE THE EXAMINATION I HAVE SIR SO
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS OF COURSE YOU CANNOT HELP US YOUR SPIRIT IS ADMIRABLE MISS SMITH SHE HAD SAID VERY SOFTLY
HE LAUGHED TOO
YET HE GREW MORE AND MORE RESTLESS
HAVING CERTAIN SCHEMES IN MIND HE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE SMITH SCHOOL WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE ALABAMA COTTON-BELT
YOU HAVE BLUNDERED INTO THE LIVES OF TWO LOVING CHILDREN AND SENT ONE WANDERING AIMLESS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND THE OTHER MOANING IN YONDER CHAMBER WITH DEATH IN HER HEART
YOU'LL HAVE TO EARN A LIVING DO YOU WORK FOR PAY I WORK TO EARN A LIVING SAME THING I RECKON AND IT AIN'T TRUE
ELSPETH'S IS AN AWFUL PLACE SHE AFFIRMED SOLEMNLY
AT ANY RATE WHO WAS BETTER
LET MY PEOPLE GO O INFINITE ONE LEST THE WORLD SHUDDER AT THE END END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE QUEST OF THE SILVER FLEECE BY W
IT'S ME THEN MUTTERING AND WANDERING NOISES AND SILENCE AGAIN
SUCH A COURSE WAS IN COLTON'S MIND DANGEROUS MONSTROUS AND UNNATURAL
ALL WAS READY FOR THE GREAT DAY
AND SHE WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
ZORA WAS NOT SURE THAT IT HAD BEEN WISE TO TELL THEIR SECRET
HE WAS BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF THE NARROWNESS AND STRAIGHTNESS OF HIS BLACK WORLD AND RED ANGER FLASHED IN HIM EVER AND AGAIN AS HE FELT HIS BONDS
IF THE FORMER HOW FAR COULD THEY TRUST HIM
MARY TAYLOR STIRRED IN HER SEAT UNDER AN INVOLUNTARY IMPULSE TO HELP BUT CRESSWELL TOUCHED THE HORSE
THEY WERE USED TO ASKING ONE'S COLOR AS ONE ASKS OF HEIGHT AND WEIGHT
HE BENT TO ENTER THE DOOR AND THEN UPLIFTING HIMSELF AND STRETCHING HIS GREAT ARMS HIS PALMS TOUCHED THE BLACKENED RAFTERS
HE HIMSELF FELT AN IMPATIENT LONGING FOR THE HAVEN OF A HOME
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY HE SAID AS THE LIGHT FLARED AND WENT OUT
I THOUGHT YOU WENT TO CHICAGO CRIED BLES
GOOD-MORNING MISS TAYLOR MARY WHO WAS WONT TO TEACH THIS WOMAN--SO LATELY A CHILD--SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR WORDS TO ADDRESS HER NOW
ZORA HE YODLED AND SHE WAVED HER APRON
AFTER A TIME THE OLD WOMAN ROSE AND HOBBLED TO A BIG BLACK CHEST
HEAVENLY FATHER WAS MAN EVER BEFORE SET TO SUCH A TASK FIGHT
BUT HE STEPPED SLOWLY BACK--"BUT BLES--YOU SAID--WILLINGLY--YOU SAID--IF--IF SHE KNEW HE THUNDERED BACK IN LIVID ANGER
YOU DON'T OWN WHAT YOU DON'T NEED AND CAN'T USE
CRESSWELL STRODE CARELESSLY ON ANSWERING HIM WITH GOOD-NATURED TOLERANCE
BUT THERE ARE A FEW SO DEPRAVED THAT IT WOULD BE SUICIDAL TO TAKE THEM INTO THIS SCHOOL
HARRY CRESSWELL LOOKED UPON THIS TRANSFORMATION WITH AN AMUSED SMILE BUT THE COLONEL SAW IN IT SIMPLY EVIDENCE OF DANGEROUS OBSTINACY IN A BLACK GIRL WHO HITHERTO HAD REFUSED TO WORK
AND ALL AT ONCE FOUND HIMSELF CONFRONTING A PARADISE
I'VE GAMBLED--BEFORE
WE'VE GOT TO SEND THAT ZORA RIGHT AWAY INDEED"--THE OBSERVATION WAS NOT EVEN INTERROGATORY
THE CARRIAGE WAS IN FRONT OF THE STORE AND SHE WAS BOUND FOR THE STORE
MISS TAYLOR WAS SURE ZORA WAS LYING AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD LIED TO HER ON OTHER OCCASIONS
YOU WISH TO GET ABOVE YOUR PLACES AND FORCE YOURSELVES WHERE YOU ARE NOT WANTED
THE VOICES OF ROB'S WIFE AND CHILDREN COULD BE HEARD BEHIND THE TWO MEN AS THEY WERE HURRIED ALONG AT A DOG TROT
HE BENT TO HER FIERCELY
THE RETURN OF ALWYN 328 THIRTY-FIVE
HE CARRIED HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND BOWED WITH GRAVITY AND DIGNITY
SHE MUST KEEP IT AND WAIT
THEN HE BEGAN TO BE ESPECIALLY ANNOYING
BUT ABOVE IT FLEW THE FIRST SWEET MUSIC BIRDLIKE ABANDONED AND THE BOY CREPT CLOSER
SHE LOOKED AT ZORA DISAPPROVINGLY WHILE ZORA LOOKED AT HER QUITE IMPERSONALLY BUT STEADILY
BUT THEIR PEOPLE KNEW THEIR RECORD AND DISCOUNTED THEM
HIS FEELINGS FOR HER WERE NOT AS YET DEFINITE EXPRESSED OR GRASPED
SHE WAS QUIET ASTUTE QUICK AND DIPLOMATIC--EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT NEGROES WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
WHAT DO THE COLORED PEOPLE WANT AND WHO CAN BEST INFLUENCE THEM IN THIS CAMPAIGN SHE CURLED UP ON THE OTTOMAN AND CONSIDERED
AT ANY RATE SAID CRESSWELL WE CAN ALL AGREE ON HELPING THESE POOR VICTIMS OF OUR QUARREL AS FAR AS THEIR LIMITED CAPACITY WILL ALLOW--AND NO FARTHER FOR THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE VERY SOON AFTER DINNER CHARLES SMITH EXCUSED HIMSELF
WITHOUT FURTHER WORD SLOWLY SHE AROSE AND WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT INTO THE SWAMP
I WANT YOU TO TAKE HER I HAVE NO PLACE FOR ONE SO YOUNG
YOU WANT TO BE
HE WAS BENT ON RETIRING AND JUST AS HE HAD SET THE DATE A YEAR HENCE HE INADVERTENTLY DIED
I ONLY WANT A LITTLE VOLUNTARY WORK ON THEIR PART HE LOOKED RELIEVED FROWNED THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE AUDIENCE AND LOOKED AT HIS BRIGHT GOLD WATCH
HE HAD THE BUILD AND LOOK OF THE FANATIC
HARRY CRESSWELL WAS SITTING OPPOSITE AND BENDING OVER AN IMPUDENT BLUE-AND-BLONDE BEAUTY
IT STRUCK MADLY AND SHARPLY AND THEN DIED AWAY TO UNEASY MURMURING
IT MIGHT RAIN
DESPITE THIS ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS MENTAL AGGRESSIVENESS SHE WAS UNUSUALLY PRESENTABLE AND ALWAYS WELL-GROOMED AND PLEASANT OF SPEECH
THAT HE SHOULD EVER MARRY HER WAS BEYOND POSSIBILITY
HERE WAS A COLLEGE-GIRL WHO COULD DIRECT HER PHILANTHROPIES AND HER ETIQUETTE DURING THE SUMMER
SHE HAD TALKED LONG AND IN DEADLY EARNEST
AND THEN WITH ONE GRIP SHE SEIZED THE OAK WHILE THE GREAT HAND OF ELSPETH TWISTED AND TORE HER SOUL
IT WAS ANOTHER FOR HER TO AIM OPENLY AT SOCIAL LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE
I WILL GIVE IT ALL UP--EVERYTHING
HE SAT IN THE BACK OF THE HALL TENSE ALERT NERVOUS
BUT BY THERE ROB LET MILLIE COME WITH ME--WE'LL SEE MISS SMITH
OH NO I WANT NO COLLECTION AT ALL
YES--THAT IS BEST SIGHED MRS VANDERPOOL
AND ANY DAY AFTER YOU GET ALL YOUR LESSONS I THINK MISS TAYLOR WILL EXCUSE YOU AND LET YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM AND READ MISS TAYLOR IT TRANSPIRED WAS MORE THAN GLAD
IT TOOK MUCH EFFORT BUT AT LAST THE CRESSWELL PARTY ESCAPED AND ROLLED OFF IN THEIR CARRIAGES
GREAT HEAVENS
GREAT HEAVENS
GREAT HEAVENS
IN THE ANNUAL EXHIBIT OF THE CORCORAN ART GALLERY A SOUTHERN GIRL HAD NEARLY WON FIRST PRIZE OVER A WESTERN MAN
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SHE ASKED
A MOMENT THE BEAST SNORTED AND PLUNGED
WHEN HE WENT TO THAT LITTLE LUNCH WITH OLD MRS GREY HE WAS NOT SURE THAT HE WANTED HIS SISTER TO LEAVE THE COTTON-BELT JUST YET
IT WAS LUNCH TIME
HARRY CRESSWELL LAID HIS HAND ON HIS FATHER'S ARM AND SAID QUIETLY
SHE CAME TO HIM FRANKLY AND GREETED HIM HER GLADNESS SHINING IN HER EYES YET LOOKING NOTHING MORE THAN GLADNESS AND SAYING NOTHING MORE
YOU KNOW WE WEAK WOMEN ARE SO IMPRACTICAL AS MY POOR JOB SO OFTEN SAID
DEATH AND PAIN PAY FOR ALL GOOD THINGS SHE HOED AWAY SILENTLY HESITATING OVER THE CHOICE OF THE PLANTS PONDERING THIS WORLD-OLD TRUTH SADDENED BY ITS RUTHLESS CRUELTY
ZORA PAUSED UNCERTAINLY AND SURVEYED THE ROOM
WE'LL GET THIS COMMITTEE WHICH TAYLOR SUGGESTS APPOINTED AND SEND IT ON A JUNKET TO ALABAMA
THEY FELT THE HEAVY TREAD OF A GREAT COMING BODY
DO SOMETHING
YES MISS
NO--NO--BUT THEN--I'LL NOT TELL YOU--I--AH A SPASM OF PAIN SHOT ACROSS HIS FACE AND HE LAY BACK WHITE AND STILL
AFTER ALL WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE
DE SEED DONE SOWED
SHE STOPPED AND BATHED IN A POOL AND COMBED HER CLOSE-CLUNG HAIR THEN ENTERED SILENTLY TO BREAKFAST
BUT THEY ALSO BROUGHT INFORMATION--DISJOINTED AND INCOMPLETE TO BE SURE--WHICH MIGHTILY INTERESTED MR TAYLOR AND SENT HIM TO ATLASES ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND CENSUS-REPORTS
HER FACE AND ZORA'S WERE A PANTOMIME FOR THE GODS
LONG DAYS SHE LAY AND SAT AND WALKED BESIDE THOSE VAST AND SPEAKING WATERS TILL AT LAST SHE KNEW THEIR VOICE AND THEY SPOKE TO HER AND THE SEA-CALM SOOTHED HER SOUL
AT LAST HE FOUND IT
I SHALL SPEAK TO HER
HE DID NOT SMILE
IT WAVERED ON THE AIR AND ALMOST BROKE THEN SWELLED IN SWEET LOW MUSIC
DE CUNNEL SAY AS HOW I OWES HIM TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS STILL AND I CAN'T SEE IT
I WON'T LIE ANY MORE AND I WON'T STEAL--AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN STARTLED WISTFULNESS--HE REMEMBERED IT IN AFTER YEARS
THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP-EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOLLS
MISS SMITH POINTED TO A PAPER
THE SEASON HAD BEEN QUITE WET ENOUGH PARTICULARLY DOWN ON THE SWAMP LAND AND BUT YESTERDAY BLES HAD VIEWED HIS DYKES WITH APPREHENSION FOR THE BLACK POOL SCOWLED ABOUT THEM
ON THE STEP OF THE CABIN FRAMED IN THE BLACK DOORWAY STOOD ZORA
AND HE THE ONE MUST CRINGE AND BEAR IN SILENCE LEST THE WORLD CRASH ABOUT THE EARS OF HIS PEOPLE
OH ONE THING
NOW I TAKE IT THE CRESSWELLS WOULD OBJECT TO INSTRUCTING THEM IN FRENCH AND IN DINNER ETIQUETTE AND TEA-GOWNS AND SO IN FACT WOULD I
HIS BLACK FOLKS MANNER VOLUBLE IMPORTANT CONDESCENDING
HE MAY BE HONEST OFFERED SENATOR SMITH CONTEMPLATING THE DOOR ALMOST WISTFULLY
FULL OF GOOD-NATURED LAUGHTER BUT QUITE UN-AMERICAN IN THE BEAUTIFUL MODULATION OF THEIR SPEAKING TONES
THIS WAS THE THING POOR BLIND BLES WAS TRYING TO ATTACK BY APPEALS FOR JUSTICE NONSENSE
HIS HANDS SHOOK
HIS VALET KNOCKED
OUT FELL THE HEAVY BALES THOUSAND UPON THOUSAND MILLION UPON MILLION UNTIL THEY SETTLED OVER THE SOUTH LIKE SOME VAST DULL-WHITE SWARM OF BIRDS
YOUR FRIENDS MR ALWYN HE SAID ADJUSTING HIS GLASSES HAVE A RATHER HIGH OPINION OF YOU
WITH A SWING OF HER ARM SHE PULLED THE GREAT OAKEN DOOR TO AND DROPPED THE BAR INTO ITS PLACE
THEN AFTER A PAUSE
BUT HERE HE WAS UNGAINLY IT MIGHT BE BUT QUITE DOCILE DRAWING THE PICTURE OF A POWER-LOOM FOR MISS CRESSWELL WHO SEEMED REALLY INTERESTED
SHE WAS SPRUNG FROM AT LEAST THREE GENERATIONS OF RESPECTABLE MULATTOES WHO HAD LEFT A LITTLE COMPETENCE WHICH YIELDED HER THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR
SLOWLY HE TURNED AWAY BUT WITH A QUICK MOTION SHE STOOD IN HIS PATH
IT'LL ALL COME OUT RIGHT
I KNEW IT ALL SHE RETORTED
I HAD A TELEGRAM FROM TAYLOR THIS MORNING AFTER YOU LEFT
A SHARP CRY AROSE FAR OFF DOWN TOWARD THE SWAMP AND THE SOUND OF GREAT FOOTSTEPS COMING COMING AS FROM THE END OF THE WORLD
THE BOY SHRANK BEFORE IT BUT STOOD HIS GROUND
GOOD-BYE INCLINED TO BE A LITTLE NASTY ASKED TAYLOR
HER BROWN SKIN INVITED A DIFFERENT ASSUMPTION
MISS TAYLOR LOOKED INTO THE VELVET BLACKNESS OF HERS AND WONDERED WHAT THEY VEILED
NO NO BUT IN GENERAL ALONG THE LINES WHICH THEY COULD APPROVE
IT WAS NOT A SONG OF JOY
NO WAS THE CURT REPLY
HOW SHE NEEDED SUCH A STRONG CLEAR-EYED HELPER IN THIS CRISIS OF HER WORK
GOOD-EVENING
SHE KNEW FROM EXPERIENCE WITH HER BROTHER THAT A WOMAN MUST PROVE HER USEFULNESS TO A MAN BEFORE HE WILL ADMIT IT AND EVEN THEN HE MAY BE SILENT
THEN SLOWLY HE TURNED AND CAME BACK
THEY WERE BOTH WONDERING AT IT THIS MORNING AS THEY WATCHED THEIR COTTON
SHE WENT INTO THE SMALL DIM ROOM AND LAYING THE COTTON-CHECK ON THE DESK STOOD WAITING
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHERS WHITE AND BLACK WHO WANT YOUR JOBS THE MENTION OF BLACK PEOPLE AS COMPETITORS FOR WAGES WAS LIKE A RED RAG TO A BULL
BLES SHE MUSED,--NOW WHO WOULD THINK OF NAMING A BOY BLESSED SAVE THESE INCOMPREHENSIBLE CREATURES HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
THE NEWS OF THE GREAT REVIVAL SPREAD AND MEN AND WOMEN CAME POURING IN
TO HIM COLONEL CRESSWELL GAVE A FEW PREGNANT DIRECTIONS
YOU WISHED TO SEE--CAROLINE WYNN YES WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MRS CRESSWELL GROPED FOR HER PROPER CUE BUT THE BROWN LADY MERELY OFFERED A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN SILENTLY
NO HE ANSWERED
HE PLACED EVERY OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF GETTING TENANTS FOR THE SCHOOL LAND
EXCHANGE CLOSED SAID TAYLOR
MARY MARY COLONEL CRESSWELL'S VOICE BROKE SUDDENLY IN UPON THEM
I WILL DO IT WAS THE LADY'S FIRM ASSURANCE
SORRY SIS BUT I'M GOING THE OTHER WAY I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID MISS CRESSWELL EASILY AS SHE SETTLED DOWN TO ANOTHER CHOCOLATE
SHE LOOKED AT HIM
AND MARY TAYLOR WAS CERTAINLY LOVELY IN SPITE OF THAT ASSUMPTION OF CLEVERNESS OF WHICH THE COLONEL COULD NOT APPROVE
THEN SILENTLY THE SOUTH GRIPPED ITSELF AND PREPARED FOR BATTLE
IT CALLS FOR MORE
THERE WERE TO COME IN FUTURE DAYS ALL THE OLD DOUBTS AND SHIVERINGS THE OLD RESTLESS CRY
CAUSE WE AIN'T WHITE AND WE CAN'T DO NOTHIN LIKE THAT TYLOR WAS ASLEEP AND SNORING AND THE OTHERS LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT EACH OTHER
GAZING FROM THE WINDOW SHE COMPARED THE LANDS SHE PASSED WITH THE LANDS SHE KNEW
LET THE BOARDERS COMPLAIN AND THE TEACHERS GOSSIP--ZORA WAS COMING
WHO WAS HE TO FALTER WHEN SHE CALLED
AS A RESULT CONTINUED MISS WYNN I HAVE A CHECK FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FINISH OUR COOKING-SCHOOL AND BUY A CAST OF MINERVA FOR THE ASSEMBLY-ROOM
THEY HEARD THE WHISPERING SWISH-SWISH OF FALLING SEED
HERE SHE WAS AN AMERICAN GIRL BY BIRTH AND BREEDING A DAUGHTER OF CITIZENS WHO HAD FOUGHT AND BLED AND WORKED FOR A DOZEN GENERATIONS ON THIS SOIL
SHE TOLD HOW LONG HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER HAD SERVED THE CRESSWELLS AND SHOWED HER RECEIPT FOR RENT PAID
HE WAS FIGHTING THE BATTLE OF HIS COLOR AND CASTE
THE TREES BENT CURIOUSLY AND STRANGE BREATHINGS WERE UPON THE BREEZES
FOR THIS REASON I TRUST YOU WILL HANDLE YOUR NEGRO PHILANTHROPIES JUDICIALLY AS I KNOW YOU WILL
NO BETTER GUARDIAN OF HER PHILANTHROPIES COULD BE FOUND THAN THESE SAME CRESSWELLS
THEY TURNED TO HIM INCREDULOUSLY
SHE'S LOOSE IN NEW YORK--A REGULAR MOB IN NEW ORLEANS--AND--HARK!--BY GOD
WHEN NO ONE ELSE HAD THE RIGHT
JUST A LITTLE CHICKEN FO YOU AND A FEW AIGS OH YOU ARE SO THOUGHTFUL SARAH SMITH'S WAS A GRATEFUL HEART
WHAT WAS NELL'S
YES AND THEIR HEADS--SMALL AND NARROW--NO BRAIN CAPACITY
HARRY SILENTLY SURVEYED THEM FROM THE DOOR AND HIS FACE LIGHTED WITH A NEW THOUGHT
THE VISION OF ZORA 254 TWENTY-EIGHT
THEN SUDDENLY HE ANNOUNCED
HE ATE HIS SOUP IN SILENCE WHEN SHE DESCANTED ON VARIOUS BENEVOLENT SCHEMES
AFTER ALL THEY NEVER WERE FAR APART EVEN IN SLAVERY DAYS
PSHAW ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL UTTERED IMPATIENTLY
HE WOULD HOWEVER WARN HIM TO MAKE NO FURTHER SPEECHES LIKE THAT OF LAST NIGHT
THE DOOR OPENED AND THEY CAME IN
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER
AND THEN BETWEEN HIM AND HER LIPS A DARK AND SHADOWY FACE
THERE WAS A DISQUIETING RELENTLESS ELEMENT IN THIS UNIMPASSIONED MAN'S TONE
THE CATASTROPHE CAME SUDDENLY
MR GREY HAD SO SUCCESSFULLY MANIPULATED THE COTTON MARKET THAT WHILE BLACK MEN WHO MADE THE COTTON STARVED IN ALABAMA AND WHITE MEN WHO BOUGHT IT FROZE IN SIBERIA HE HIMSELF SAT HIGH ON A THRONE OF ROYAL STATE THAT FAR OUTSHONE THE WEALTH OF ORMUZ OR OF IND NOTWITHSTANDING THIS HE DIED EVENTUALLY LEAVING THE BURDEN OF HIS WEALTH TO HIS BEWILDERED WIFE AND HIS BUSINESS TO THE ASTUTE MR EASTERLY
THE OLD MAN MUST BE HARD PRESSED TO SELL TO THE CRESSWELLS
GOOD--GOOD-EVENING SHE SAID STRAIGHTENING HERSELF
HE WAS MAKING MONEY
HE WAS MAKING MONEY
HE WAS MAKING MONEY
BRILLIANT-EYED
BUT SUCH MATTERS ARE MORE DIFFICULT AND SLOWER OF ADJUSTMENT OVER THERE--SO DAMNED MUCH LAW AND GOSPEL BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE WHAT'S THAT YOU ARE PLANNING TO COMBINE AND CONTROL THE MANUFACTURE OF COTTON YES BUT HOW ABOUT YOUR RAW MATERIAL
WOULD HE BE AMENABLE TO HER TRAINING AND BECOME WORLDLY WISE
WITH RELUCTANT FAREWELL BLES TURNED HOME
THE GIRL TREMBLED A LITTLE BUT PLODDED RESOLUTELY ON UNTIL THE DIM SILVER DISK OF THE HALF-MOON BEGAN TO GLIMMER THROUGH THE TREES
ZORA SHIVERED AND A GRAYISH HORROR MOTTLED THE DARK BURNING OF HER FACE
HE WAS HELPING HER FROM THE CARRIAGE WITH SMILING EYES AND HER INNOCENT BLUE EYES WERE FASTENED ON HIM
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS QUITE UPSET
CLOSER AND CLOSER THEY PRESSED THE SILKEN FLEECE
DURING THE PROGRAMME BLES APPLAUDED VOCIFEROUSLY EVERY NUMBER THAT PLEASED HIM WHICH IS TO SAY EVERY ONE--AND STAMPED HIS FEET UNTIL HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO HIMSELF
HIS MASTER'S VOICE ALWYN IS ORDERED TO EAT HIS WORDS OR GET OUT WATCH HIM DO IT GRACEFULLY THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS ETC
MEANTIME THERE OCCURRED TO THE BOY THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION OF CLOTHES
NONE OF THEM DISCERNED THE HANDWRITING OF DESTINY
THE PROPOSAL CAUGHT THE IMAGINATION OF THE SOUTHERN SET
AWFULLY INTERESTING HE SAID AWFULLY
SHE DID NOT DO THE THINGS VERY WELL AND SHE BROKE SOME CHINA BUT SHE WORKED EARNESTLY AND QUICKLY AND THERE WAS NO THOUGHT OF PAY
THEN THINGS BEGAN TO GO WRONG
BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE ENCOUNTERING OPPOSITION FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED SOURCE THE LADY WAS RECEPTIVE AND THE SPEAKER CONCLUDED
BUT FOR THE CHILD,--SHE ISN'T TO BLAME THE OLDER WOMAN WAVERED
VERY POORLY ANSWERED ZORA SADLY
YOU MUST HURRY BLES
HE MIGHT BE SEVENTY EIGHTY OR EVEN NINETY--INDEED THERE WAS ABOUT HIM THAT INDEFINABLE SENSE OF AGE--SOME SHADOW OF ENDLESS LIVING
YELL JACK TOLLIVER YOU SNEAKING SCAMP T'WIL THE LORD TELL UNCLE BILL WHO RUINED HIS DAUGHTER
HIS HANDS IF THEY TOUCHED HER WERE SOFT AND TENDER AND YET HE GAVE A CURIOUS IMPRESSION OF STRENGTH AND POISE AND WILL
SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM AS A BOY--AN OLD STUDENT A SORT OF CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT
BUT SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO ATTEMPT IT AND SHE SAID ALOUD HALF MOCKINGLY
ALL WOMEN KNOW
TALK WITH THOMPSON
HER FACE WENT SUDDENLY GRAY
BUT HE BROUGHT THE WORD ZORA DON'T TALK CANT
THEY SHOULD NOT ENSLAVE HER
SLOWLY BUT SURELY THE GIRL HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF IN THIS NEW WORLD
IN THE PRIVATE VIEW AND AWARD OF PRIZES WHICH PRECEDED THE LARGER SOCIAL FUNCTION THE JURY HESITATED LONG BETWEEN THE OUTCASTS AND A PAINTING FROM GEORGIA
ESPECIALLY WAS THERE ONE FROM NEW ORLEANS TALL AND DARK BUT IT WAS NO CALLER
THERE WAS A BLACK MAN WALTZING WITH A WHITE WOMAN--NO SHE WAS NOT WHITE FOR MARY CAUGHT THE CREAM AND CURL OF THE GIRL AS SHE SWEPT PAST
BLES I AM ASHAMED TO HEAR YOU TALK SO OF YOUR NEIGHBORS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE WHITE BUT BLES CONTINUED
THE TALK AND LAUGHTER GREW LOUD AND BOISTEROUS AND THE RED FIRE GLARED IN THE NIGHT
SHE HOPPED TO THE TREE
SLOWLY ZORA FORGOT HER BLOOD AND PAIN
IN THIS HE WAS BUT FOLLOWING THE TEACHING OF HIS HIGHEST IDEAL LATELY DECEASED MR JOB GREY
AND ZORA STRAINED HER EYES NORTHWARD THROUGH THE NIGHT
TODAY MARY WAS GOING NORTH
HOW FOOLISH OF HER NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS
ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS HINTED NOT ONCE BUT MANY TIMES THAT THE CRESSWELLS WERE WELL ENOUGH BUT WHO WAS THAT UPSTART WIFE WHO PRESUMED TO TAKE SOCIAL PRECEDENCE
SHE FENCED FOR TIME
SATURDAY MORNINGS THEY WOULD GO TO THE SWAMP AND WORK TOGETHER AND SOMETIMES MISS SMITH STEALING AWAY FROM CURIOUS EYES WOULD COME AND SIT AND TALK WITH THEM AS THEY TOILED
THE SENATOR WAS LATE THIS MORNING
THESE PEOPLE WERE SO SLOW--NOW A NEW ENGLAND BOY WOULD HAVE ANSWERED AND ASKED A HALF-DOZEN QUESTIONS IN THE TIME I--I DON'T KNOW HE FALTERED
NOT MUCH DRILY
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE YOU CHOSEN AS HIGH SCHOOL COMMENCEMENT ORATOR ME
AFTER THE MIRACLE OF THE BURSTING BOLLS WHEN THE LAND WAS BRIGHTEST WITH THE PILED MIST OF THE FLEECE AND WHEN THE CRY OF THE NAKED WAS LOUDEST IN THE MOUTHS OF MEN A SUDDEN CLOUD OF WORKERS SWARMED BETWEEN THE COTTON AND THE NAKED SPINNING AND WEAVING AND SEWING AND CARRYING THE FLEECE AND MINING AND MINTING AND BRINGING THE SILVER TILL THE SONG OF SERVICE FILLED THE WORLD AND THE POETRY OF TOIL WAS IN THE SOULS OF THE LABORERS
FATAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTH AND BAD FOR THE COTTON COMBINE
WHY SHOULD THE TRUST NONSENSE FATHER--WHAT'S THE USE OF UNDERSTANDING
YET HE MANAGED TO STAY WITH HER QUITE HAPPILY
BUT HE'S STRONGLY RECOMMENDED WHAT SHALL WE OFFER HIM ASKED THE CHAIRMAN
SHE WAS MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EMMA AND BLES WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MANY DIFFICULTIES
I'M A CRESSWELL YET NELL A CRESSWELL AND A GEN HE SWAYED
BUT OF COURSE HE HAS NO CHANCE WHY IT'S CIVIL-SERVICE ISN'T IT IT IS
I KNOWS MORE THAN THEY DO NOW--A HEAP MORE IN SOME WAYS YOU DO
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN IN HER CABIN
BLACK MEN AND WHITE WOMEN CANNOT TALK TOGETHER CASUALLY IN THE SOUTH AND SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR THE NORTH HAD PUT NOTIONS IN ALWYN'S HEAD
THANKS
HE OUGHT TO MARRY SOME GOOD GIRL--NOT ZORA BUT SOME ONE
NOTICE HOW SOME SLEPT WHEN DR BOLDISH WAS SPEAKING
COULD SHE PASS OH THEY MIGHT THINK HER SPANISH BUT IT'S A SNOBBISH PLACE AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP ALL HER FRIENDS YES FREDDIE COULD SCARCELY VISIT THE REST WAS LOST
SOME WHITE AND SWAGGERING AND LIBERAL WITH TOBACCO-JUICE
HE SET HIS POWERFUL VOICE AND THE FRENZY OF HIS HEARERS TO CRUSH HER
WHY HE'S THE MAN THAT'S WAITING SAM IS IT
THEN HIS PARTNER STILLINGS WORKED THE IMPUDENT NEGRO TEACHER ARGUMENT ON CRESSWELL UNTIL CRESSWELL WAS WILD TO GET THE SOUTH IN CONTROL OF THE SCHOOLS BUT WHAT DO TEERSWELL AND STILLINGS WANT THEY WANT BLES ALWYN TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT IS A TRIFLE CRYPTIC MISS WYNN MUSED
I RECKON I'VE BEEN MIGHTY BAD WITH YOU AND YOU ALWAYS SO GOOD TO ME
HUNGER AND PALE MURDER
YOU ARE REFRESHING SHE SAID
OH YES I'VE MET MISS WYNN WHY HERE IS MISS WYNN NOW BLES TURNED
HE DARED NOT THINK WHAT A LONG HEAVY RAIN MIGHT DO TO THE WONDERFUL ISLAND OF COTTON WHICH NOW STOOD FULLY FIVE FEET HIGH WITH FLOWERS AND SQUARES AND BUDDING BOLLS
HE WAS SPECTACLED WITH BUSHY EYEBROWS AND A SLEEPY LOOK
BUT TONIGHT HE WAS MOVED AS GREATLY AS HIS HEARERS HAD BEEN AND THAT WAS DANGEROUS
BUT HOW HAD IT BEEN SAVED
HEAVEN IS MY HOME
THE SHOPS AND LIGHTS AND NOISE
THEY WENT OVER THE MATTER CAREFULLY AND THE LAWYER ACQUIRED A RESPECT FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
AND WE'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS WON'T WE YES SHE SAID AT LAST SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY AND ANOTHER BRIEF MOMENT THEY STOOD STILL
FOUND MYSELF CALLED THROUGH MONTGOMERY JUST AFTER I GOT YOUR WIRE
AND ZORA WROTE
SUDDENLY FORGETTING HER TROUBLE SHE BUBBLED WITH LAUGHTER AND LEAPING UP CLAPPED HER HANDS
THEY WERE THE ROCK FOUNDATION
WHEN I WAS A BABY I LOVED YOU BUT THAT IS LONG AGO
GOOD-NIGHT ALL SHE CALLED BUT SHE BOWED TO MR TEERSWELL
HOW'S THE SCHOOL GETTING ON HE ASKED SUDDENLY
IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND YET WHY SO SUDDENLY HAD THE THREADS OF LIFE LET GO
AND THEN SEEING THE HALF-FORMED QUESTION YES AND YOU NEED ME
MEANTIME MISS TAYLOR HAD MISSED HER BROOCH AND SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN
THEY TOOK OFF THEIR COATS STRETCHED THEMSELVES ON THE SEATS AND EXCHANGED JOKES
FOR MARY AND HER BROTHER HAD GONE NORTH HELEN HAD GONE TO BED AND THE COLONEL WAS IN TOWN
THE CLERK WAS NEW AND ANXIOUS TO SELL
SHE SOUGHT THE WAY BUT WHAT WAY AND WHITHER SHE DID NOT KNOW SHE DARED NOT DREAM
AND YET SHE FOUND HERSELF TODAY NO NEARER HER GOAL THAN WHEN FIRST SHE MARRIED
I THINK I MIGHT BE OF SERVICE IN THIS MATTER OF THE EXAMINATION AND THEN PERHAPS I'D GET A CHANCE TO SAY A WORD FOR MYSELF I'D BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU COME SAID BLES CORDIALLY
YET SHE LOOKED DIFFERENT
THEY CAME HEADLONG GUIDED BY PINE-TORCHES WHICH THREW THEIR WHITE AND HAGGARD FACES INTO WILD DISTORTION
BY THE BYE SIS THERE'S A YOUNG LADY OVER AT THE NEGRO SCHOOL WHOM I THINK YOU'D LIKE BLACK OR WHITE A YOUNG LADY I SAID
A FEAR STARTED WITHIN HIM AND SOMETHING ELSE
THEY ARE JUST HUMAN--BUT OH
WELL THEN THERE REMAINS RAW COTTON
THEY GET TOO DAMNED MANY SIDE ISSUES
THE MORE TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT THE SURER THE VICTORY SHE LAUGHED AT HIS EARNESTNESS
THE COLONEL SAID NOTHING
THIS LAND WAS WORTH ONLY TEN DOLLARS AN ACRE A DECADE AGO HE SAYS
THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED BEHIND HIM AND HE WHEELED AROUND
SHE HAD HAD A BUST ACCEPTED BY THE CORCORAN ART GALLERY ONCE AND WHEN THEY FOUND SHE WAS COLORED THEY RETURNED IT
SHE HAD BEEN HERE FOUR MONTHS AND YET EVERY MOMENT UP TO NOW SHE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN VIVIDLY ALMOST PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS A WHITE WOMAN TALKING TO BLACK FOLK
WOMEN WITH BUNDLES AND CHILDREN MEN WITH GUNS TOTTERING OLD FOLKS WIDE-EYED BOYS AND GIRLS
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE FACTS HE ASKED SUDDENLY
IF COTTON FELL TO SIX HE HADN'T A CENT ON EARTH
A RAPID RIDE EVEN NOW MIGHT SECURE HIGH OFFICE FOR ALWYN AND MAKE CRESSWELL AMBASSADOR
THE YELLOW SUNSHINE BEAT FIERCELY AROUND AND UPON HIM AS HE STUMBLED INTO THE HIGHWAY LURCHED ACROSS THE MUD-STREWN ROAD AND PANTED UP THE PORCH
HERE'S YOUR RECEIPT THE BLOW HAD FALLEN
IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THE UNPLEASANT THINGS THAT KEPT HAPPENING BUT THE CONTINUED APPREHENSION OF UNKNOWN POSSIBILITIES
THE REPLY THAT CAME AFTER SOME DELAY WAS ALMOST CURT
SOME GOOD AND PURE WOMAN WHO WOULD HELP AND UPLIFT AND SERVE HIM
WHO HAD RUSHED THE NEWS TO THIS WOMAN
BUT I'VE GOT ANOTHER RING ALREADY SHE SAID
THE OLD MAN WAS DISCOVERED SITTING BEFORE HIS CABIN WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
THERE WAS MRS GREY COMFORTABLE AND BEAMING MR EASTERLY WHO THOUGHT THIS A GOOD BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY AND HIS FAMILY
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER PLANS SHE NEEDED BLES ALWYN'S CONSTANT COOPERATION
BUT I'VE GOT TO DO JUST A LITTLE BUT ZORA WAS ADAMANT
CAREFUL HE WARNED STRUGGLING AFTER HER UNTIL SHE DISAPPEARED AMID THE LEAVES
TOO TRIFLING TO STICK TO A JOB AND FULL OF NORTHERN NONSENSE GROWLED THE COLONEL
THE CHANGE IN ZORA HOWEVER HAD BEEN NEITHER CATACLYSMIC NOR REVOLUTIONARY AND IT WAS YET FAR--VERY FAR--FROM COMPLETE
SHE MUST NEVER FALL LOWER
BUT HE WAS BURIED IN HIS PAPER FROWNING
SHE LAID THE PIN ON THE DESK AND ON SUDDEN IMPULSE SPOKE AGAIN TO THE GIRL AS SHE ARRANGED HER NECK TRIMMINGS
SHE WOULD GO INTO THE WORLD AND FIND--NOT LOVE BUT THE THING GREATER THAN LOVE
HE HAD HALF MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THIS WAS THE PROPER TIME TO CALL ON MISS WYNN
DRINK SHE CRIED
ZORA HIDE IT AND KEEP IT IF YOU WANT IT
I WAS A-FEARED IT WAS A LONG WAY OFF
YES HE CALMLY ADMITTED
YES SOMETIMES I DO
OUT OF IT FILED A STREAM OF MEN--SOME BLACK AND SHACKLED
I SUPPOSE THE NEXT BIT OF EXCITEMENT WILL BE IN THE INAUGURATION SHE SAID TO MRS VANDERPOOL
SO IT RAINED FOR ONE LONG WEEK AND SO FOR SEVEN ENDLESS DAYS BLES WATCHED IT WITH LEADEN HEART
WE SORELY NEED A NATIONAL BALL-ROOM SHE SAID
DREAMS 5 TWO
THE SUN WAS SETTING
WHO WAS CARING FOR HER AND WHAT WAS SHE DOING
BREAKING HIS LABOR CONTRACT ANY WITNESSES I HAVE THE CONTRACT HERE ANNOUNCED THE SHERIFF
I SHALL BE AT HOME AT EIGHT TONIGHT IT SEEMED TO BLES AN EXCEEDINGLY SILLY THING TO DO--CALLING ON A BUSY MAN WITH NO ERRAND
I--I DON'T THINK YOU PERHAPS UNDERSTOOD ME MR TAYLOR HE GASPED
HE DISTRUSTED HIMSELF
OH I DON'T KNOW
SUPPOSE MR ALWYN SHOULD TAKE THIS OCCASION TO MAKE A THOROUGH DEFENCE OF THE PARTY BUT--WILL HE THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN SENATOR SMITH POINTED OUT RISING AND THE REAL REASON OF THIS INTERVIEW
IT'S COME
HIS WHITE FOLKS MANNER SOFT HUMBLE WHEEDLING
RATHER IN THE FIELDS AT THE PLOUGH AND IN THE KITCHEN
BUT WITHIN HER SOUL SANG SOME NEW SONG OF PEACE
NOT THE END SHE SPOKE CONFIDENTLY
THE DRONE OF THE READER HUSHED
BLACK GIANTS AND PIGMIES WERE THERE
AND BEHIND HER LAY THE FIELD OF DREAMS
WELL WRITE ONE HE INDULGENTLY ASSENTED
YONDER LIES THE SILVER FLEECE SPREAD ACROSS THE BROWN BACK OF THE WORLD
BUT SHE WON'T HURT YOU--YOU'S GOT THE SPELL AND WHEELING AGAIN SHE WAS BACK AT THE FIRE
NOW THAT HAIR WAS FADED AND FALLING SO FAST THAT AT LAST THE DOCTOR ADVISED HER TO CUT IT SHORT
MUD DOESN'T HURT MUCH
NONE SUSPECTED A POSSIBLE INTRUSION OF THE ETERNAL RACE ISSUE FOR NO NEGROES WERE ALLOWED IN THE CORCORAN EXHIBIT OR SCHOOL
SHE MUST OFFER THIS UNSULLIED SOUL UP UNTO GOD IN MIGHTY ATONEMENT--BUT HOW
SHE BELIEVED IT WRONG TO ENCOURAGE THE AMBITIONS OF THESE CHILDREN TO ANY GREAT EXTENT
WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST THE DIFFICULTY OF ELECTING OUR MAN I THOUGHT THAT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION IT WAS
THREE TIMES THE MAN PASSED HIS HANDS WAVE-LIKE ABOVE THE DEAD
MARY CRESSWELL WORKED WITH REDOUBLED ENERGY AND FOR NEARLY A WEEK HARRY STAID AT HOME NIGHTS AND STUDIED
IN TRUTH I NEED IT
I CAN DO IT SAID ZORA WHO WAS IN THE ROOM
SO ZORA PAID NO ATTENTION BUT SAT STILL AND THOUGHT
AND ABOVE ALL HER OWN NORTHERN BIRTH AND PRESUMABLY PRO-NEGRO SYMPATHIES
THEN AS BONFIRE AFTER BONFIRE MET THEIR GAZE THEY MOVED SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY AND AT LAST SENT A VOLLEY OF BULLETS AT THE FIRES
AND THE GIRL'S EYES GLEAMED WITH A WILD NEW JOY
COMPANIONSHIP AND LOVE THERE WAS AND SHE TOLD HERSELF ALWAYS WOULD BE
HE WAS GETTING NERVOUS
I HAVE NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION
THEY WERE HE WAS SURE AS DISSOLUTE AND WEAK AS THEIR PARENTS BUT THEY WERE SHREWDER AND MORE ASPIRING
RISING PRICE OF COTTON YOU MEAN HARRY CORRECTED
PITY AT THE PERFECTLY USELESS STRUGGLE TO RAISE THE UNRAISABLE A WONDER AT CERTAIN SIGNS OF RISING
WAS ELSPETH NOW AT PEACE
YES SHE SAID CRISPLY
SHE WROTE TWO NOTES AND POSTED THEM AS SHE WENT OUT TO WALK
ALL THIS WAS NEW TO HELEN CRESSWELL AND SHE LIKED IT
THEY'RE GETTING BIGGER ALMIGHTY FAST AND THERE'S A BIG COTTON-LAND MONOPOLY IN SIGHT
WHAT'S THAT ASKED BLES
YOU ARE SIMPLY A FOOL
WHO WILL CRY
SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS
TEERSWELL WHO WAS SPEAKING AFFECTED NOT TO NOTICE THEM AND CONTINUED
I--I THINK I UNDERSTAND HE GRAVELY SAID AT LAST
HIS CHANCE TO DO AND THEREBY TO BE HAD NOT COME
THE RESULT WAS CURIOUS
BUT HOW?--HOW
BUT ZORA'S FACE AGAIN WAS MASKED
THEN HE CLOSED THE DOOR SOFTLY AND WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD HER
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DELICIOUS LANGUOR IN THE LATE LINGERING FALL OF ALABAMA THAT SUITED HER PERFECTLY
WE WANT ALL SORTS OF INDUSTRIES
STILL SHE TRIED EVERY LURE AND SET FALSE STORIES GOING AMONG THE NEGROES EVEN WHEN I SOUGHT TO RESCUE ZORA
MRS GREY ACQUIESCED GLADLY AND ANNOUNCED HER PLAN EVENTUALLY WRITING MISS SMITH OF HER DECISION TO SECOND HER NOBLE EFFORTS IN HELPING THE POOR COLORED PEOPLE AND SHE HOPED TO HAVE THE PLAN UNDER WAY BEFORE NEXT FALL
I DID IT--I SUDDENLY HE ROSE AND STOOD ERECT AND HIS WILD EYES STRICKEN WITH DEATH STARED FULL UPON EMMA
HUMANITY WAS NEAR AND REAL
IT WAS HER NEIGHBOR TOLLIVER--A GAUNT YELLOW-FACED WHITE MAN RAGGED ROUGH AND UNKEMPT
WE PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE WE GET ENOUGH TO RUN THE SCHOOL AS IT HAS BEEN RUN
I MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE DISAGREEMENT INTERRUPTED MR CRESSWELL HESITATINGLY
WHAT FOR SHE ASKED LOOKING AT THE LETTERS DISDAINFULLY
WOULD BLES CARE IF I TOLD SHE ASKED DOUBTFULLY
SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS IN GLEE
THEY FOUND THEIR HOSTESS GAY AND ENTERTAINING
CURSE ME O GOD IF I LET ME LOSE HER AGAIN AND GOD REMEMBERED THIS IN AFTER YEARS
ABOUT THIS TIME EASTERLY JOINED HIM AND POINTED OUT A NEW ROAD--THE BUYING AND SELLING OF STOCK IN VARIOUS COTTON-MILLS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES
THE DARKIES SAY WE'VE DESERTED THEM MRS VANDERPOOL LAUGHED
SO AFTER SIX ENDLESS MONTHS MARY CRESSWELL WALKED INTO HER WASHINGTON HOME AGAIN
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HER TO BROOD AND THEN RESTLESSLY TO SEEK RELIEF IN CONSULTING THE ONE PERSON NEAR WHO KNEW HER STORY
BUT THE VAST VICARIOUS SUFFERING FOR THE EVIL OF THE WORLD
SHE WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THESE POOR BEASTS OF BURDEN TO BE DECENT IN THEIR TOIL
IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HIS APARTMENT IN THE NEW YORK HOTEL WAS NOT SATISFACTORY OR HIS BREAKFAST UNPALATABLE
THEY SAY YOU USED TO TEACH DARKIES
NOT UNTIL THE STARS OF MIDNIGHT HAD SWUNG TO THE ZENITH DID THEY START DOWN THROUGH THE SWAMP
THOSE BLACK FOLK IN WHOM HE RECOGNIZED THE OLD SWEET-TEMPERED NEGRO TRAITS HAD ALSO LOOSER UGLIER MANNERS THAN HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FROM WHICH HE SHRANK
I MAY OPEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND
THAT NIGHT TEERSWELL CALLED ON HIM IN HIS MODEST LODGINGS WHERE OVER HOT WHISKEY AND WATER THEY TALKED
HE PUZZLES ME
HE RATHER THOUGHT THAT HE DID
INTO HER FIRST DESPAIR HAD CREPT IN ONE FIERCE MOMENT GRIM DETERMINATION
AT FIRST I DID
IT WAS A COMBINATION WHICH SHE FELT SHE NEEDED
ONCE IN JOHN TAYLOR'S BROADWAY OFFICE HE OPENED THE SUBJECT ABRUPTLY--THE MORE SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HE FELT A RESENTMENT AGAINST TAYLOR FOR CERTAIN UNNAMED OR PARTIALLY VOICED ASSUMPTIONS
BEWARE OF DEM DAT CALLS EBIL GOOD
WHAT DID HE EVER DO
FREED FROM MONEY CARES PRAISED FOR HIS GENERALSHIP IN THE COTTON CORNER ABLE TO ENTERTAIN SUMPTUOUSLY HE WAS AGAIN A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE OLDER SCHOOL AND SO IN HIS ENVIED ELEMENT
ONE CONSIDERATION ALONE KEPT THEM FROM SHRINKING AWAY AND THAT WAS ZORA'S INFLUENCE
COME SHE SAID I'LL TAKE THE CLOTHES HOME THEN WE'LL GO"--SHE GLANCED AT HIM--"DOWN WHERE THE DREAMS ARE AND LAUGHING THEY HURRIED ON
I WANTED TO COME MISS ZORA BUT I WAS AFEARED
DROPPING THE BROOCH INTO HIS HAND SHE WHEELED AND FLED TOWARD THE CABIN
LISTEN TILL I TELL YOU OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEN SHE TOO HEARD THE STORY OF JASON
THE NEXT AFTERNOON JOHN TAYLOR WAS SITTING BESIDE HELEN CRESSWELL ON THE PORCH WHICH OVERLOOKED THE TERRACE AND WAS ON THE WHOLE THINKING LESS OF COTTON THAN HE HAD FOR SEVERAL YEARS
NOT IN PRAYING BUT IN WORKS
NOW TO BUSINESS SHE SAID BRISKLY
THERE'LL BE A BRIGHT MOON TONIGHT VENTURED BLES
BUT MISS WYNN DID NOT PROPOSE TO BE STRANDED ON THE NEGRO PROBLEM
ESPECIALLY WAS SHE STARTLED AT SEEING ZORA A MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND APPARENTLY HIGH IN FAVOR
IT LOWERED THREATENINGLY
THE ATMOSPHERE OF MRS GREY'S ORNATE COTTAGE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE VANDERPOOLS
NO DON'T PUT YOUR CLEAN WHITE HANDS UPON ME NELL TILL I WASH MINE
THEN SHE ADDED PLEASANTLY
I OUGHT TO HAVE CUT DOWN THE TEACHING FORCE TO THE BAREST MINIMUM AND GONE NORTH BEGGING--BUT I COULDN'T
YOUR HONOR MY CASE IS SIMPLE AND WITH YOUR HONOR'S PERMISSION I WISH TO CONDUCT IT MYSELF
THE FARTHER BOY COUGHED AND BLES RAISED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT HER
IT WILL COST SOMETHING SAID ZORA
THE CRESSWELLS AND WITH IT CAME A SUDDEN DESIRE NOT TO MEET THEM--JUST THEN
SLOW SLOW
THEY WERE ALL WELL-DRESSED AND LEISURELY FAIRLY GOOD LOOKING AND THEY SAID THE SAME WORDS AND DID THE SAME THINGS IN THE SAME WAY
THE DREAMS AND LEAPING AHEAD SHE DANCED ALONG THE SHADOWED PATH
MISS SMITH TURNED AROUND VERY METHODICALLY AND TOOK HER HAND
ABOVE ALL BE THRIFTY AND SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT COMPLAIN AND WHINE AT YOUR APPARENT DISADVANTAGES
THEY WENT UP THE PATH TOGETHER AND PARTED DIFFIDENTLY HE WATCHING HER FLIT AWAY WITH SORROWFUL EYES A LITTLE DISTURBED AND PUZZLED AT THE BURDEN HE HAD VOLUNTARILY ASSUMED BUT NEVER DREAMING OF DRAWING BACK
TODAY TOM YOU'RE AN INSUFFERABLE CAD AND I--WELL I'M TOO MUCH LIKE YOU TO HAVE TWO OF US IN THE SAME FAMILY BUT STILLINGS HE BURST FORTH ALMOST IN TEARS
IF HE HAD THOUGHT SHE WOULD PAY I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE SIGNED THE PAPER COLONEL CRESSWELL WENT RED THAN PALE AND LEANING FORWARD BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT HE HURLED
THE BLACK BOY TOO WENT HIS WAY IN SILENT BURNING RAGE
NEXT CAME THIS NEWS OF MRS GREY'S PROBABLE CONDITIONS
YES FATHER HE STARTED UP THE FRONT STAIRWAY AND ZORA HURRIED UP THE NARROW BACK STAIRS ALMOST OVERTURNING A SERVANT
THEN THE YOUNG MAN ROSE UNSTEADILY
AS THE BLACK PORTER PASSED HER SHE SAID GENTLY
GOD CALLS
THEN THE ENTERTAINMENT STRAIGHTWAY LOST ALL ITS CHARM
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO MISS WYNN HOLDING A CRUMPLED NOTE AND HIS VOICE FALTERED A LITTLE
WHEN NO ONE CARED SHE HAD HOVERED OVER HIS SOUL AS SOME DARK GUARDIAN ANGEL
MRS CRESSWELL--THIS IS A PERSONAL AFFAIR SHE REDDENED ANGRILY
HE AND HIS SON--A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO THE NAME--HOLD SOME FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES
TWO HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN ROSE AND PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO HELP ZORA
THE HARD HUMAN WHITE SEEMED TO GLOW AND LIVE AND RUN A MAD GAMUT OF THE SPECTRUM FROM MORN TILL NIGHT FROM WHITE TO BLACK
HOW COULD SHE FIND OUT
WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR--"LITERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND--OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
THINGS FITTED TOGETHER AS IF THEY BELONGED TOGETHER
WELL SHE MUST BEGIN AGAIN
I SENT HER
THEY WERE DOGGED AND IMPATIENT AND THEY COULD SUGGEST NO REMEDY
THERE NOW
NO FATHER THIS IS THE SITUATION--THREE GOOD CROPS IN SUCCESSION WILL WIPE OFF OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND LEAVE US FACING ONLY LOW PRICES AND A SCARCITY OF NIGGERS
NOW LET ME TELL YOU
THIS LEFT HER ILL-SHAPED HEAD EXPOSED AND EMPHASIZED THE SUNKEN HOLLOWS OF HER FACE
OTHERS HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE--THEY SEEMED STRANGE AND ALIEN--SHARPER QUICKER AND AT ONCE MORE OVERBEARING AND MORE UNSCRUPULOUS
AN HOUR AGO IT SEEMED THAT THIS LAST BLOW MUST HAVE KILLED HER
SHE'S VERY LATE
IT HAD SEEMED INDEED RATHER FINE IMPARTING AS IT DID AN OLD-FASHIONED FLAVOR
SHE FUMBLED WITH HER CANE
YE--ES--I RECKON HE SLOWLY RETURNED
NO HE ANSWERED SLOWLY
HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO HEAR THE CALL FOR PROSPECTIVE TENANTS
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD TO HELP THE THIEVING JASON SHE LOOKED AT HIM SEARCHINGLY
I DO NOT BLAME YOU BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT DO IT
AND SO DID THE CITY AT FIRST TO ME STILL
IT WAS CEILED IN DARK YELLOW PINE WITH FIGURED DENIM ON THE WALLS
IT WOULD IF WE RAN IT WE YES--WE SOUTHERNERS UM!--I SEE--THERE'S LIGHT
DURING THE SPRING LONG NEGOTIATIONS WERE ENTERED INTO BY MISS SMITH TO BUY THE FIVE MEN
AS THE FALL PROGRESSED MASS-MEETINGS WERE HELD IN WASHINGTON AND THE SMALL TOWNS
SHE MUST WRITE ALWYN'S SPEECH
THE NEGROES THE NEGROES YES
BUT I PRESUME NOT SOMETHING POLITICAL YES
HE ISN'T FAIR
WON'T YOU COME IN SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE PARLOR WHERE SHE SAT DOWN
OH MY PEOPLE SHE ALMOST SOBBED
WEEP MAY HAYNES FOR THAT BABY BUT THE WOMAN'S SHRIEK DROWNED HIS WORDS AND HE WHIRLED FULL ON THE PREACHER STAMPING HIS FEET AND WAVING HIS HANDS
YES I DID IMMENSELY--I HOPE I DIDN'T DISTURB YOU
CAN'T TELL HE SAID FRAID NOT MUCH THOUGH HE GLANCED THROUGH A TELEGRAM
ONLY OCCASIONALLY A WANDERING BREEZE SEARCHING THE HIDDEN PLACES OF THE SWAMP OR THE CALL AND SONG OF NIGHT BIRDS JARRED THE STILLNESS
MISS TAYLOR WONDERED A LITTLE AT THE BOUNTY OF SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY
AS ALREADY SOMETHING OF THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD HAD FOUND QUESTION AND ANSWER IN HER SOUL AND AS SHE BEGAN TO REALIZE HOW THE WORLD HAD WAXED OLD IN THOUGHT AND STATURE SO NOW IN THEIR LAST DAYS A SENSE OF THE POWER OF MEN AS SET OVER AGAINST THE IMMENSITY AND FORCE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS BECAME REAL TO HER
MY FATHER SET GREAT STORE BY BLACKS AND WAS A LEADING ABOLITIONIST BEFORE HE DIED MR TAYLOR WAS THINKING FAST
I FOUGHT FOR MY FREEDOM
HE AROSE WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR
THESE DAYS WERE DAYS OF ALTERNATE HOPE AND DOUBT WITH BLES ALWYN
SEE THE JUDGE BEGAN THE LAWYER AND THEN REMEMBERED AS HE WAS OFTEN FORCED TO DO THESE DAYS WHO WAS JUDGE
I MUST GO SHE SAID BEFORE MARY COULD SPEAK
MISS SMITH IS ENGAGED THIS MORNING
ON ON IT CAME UNTIL IT SWUNG INTO SIGHT
THE MERCHANT TO WHOM HE WENT LAST LAUGHED
I'VE GOT THE NEGRO SECRET SOCIETIES BACKING ME AND--I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU--THE SOLID SOUTHERN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION
A BUSINESS MAN TWO FASHIONABLE LADIES THREE COLLEGE GIRLS A GRAY-HAIRED COLORED WOMAN AND A YOUNG SPECTACLED BROWN MAN AND THEN TO HER SURPRISE MRS VANDERPOOL AND ZORA
HOW GOES THE GREAT BATTLE FOR BLACK MEN'S RIGHTS
YOU WILL NEVER LEARN
WHY IS YOU TRYING TO MAKE DIS OLE WORLD BETTER
IS THIS A NEW GAG MRS CRESSWELL LOOKED DOWN AT HERSELF INVOLUNTARILY AND SMILED WANLY
YOU KNOW THAT WE COULD NOT GIVE THE PRIZE TO A--NEGRO WHY NOT THAT IS QUITE IMMATERIAL
THESE NEW-BORN GREEN THINGS HIDDEN FAR DOWN IN THE SWAMP BEGOTTEN IN WANT AND MYSTERY WERE TO HER A LIVING WONDERFUL FAIRY TALE COME TRUE
BIG STORES AND SMALL WIDE-WINDOWED NARROW STORES
ALL THE NEIGHBORS BEHAVED AS IF HER EXCUSE OF ILL-HEALTH WERE SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR HER RETURN SOUTH TO ESCAPE THE RIGORS OF A NORTHERN WINTER
THE PRESSES CREAKED AND GROANED
NOW ABOUT THIS CHILD LABOR BILL
HIGH NOON FOUND ZORA PEERING DOWN THE HIGHWAY UNDER HER SHADING HAND BUT NO SOUL IN SIGHT
HE'S TWENTY NOW AND BIG WHIPPED HIM MISS SMITH REPEATED
PERHAPS--BUT THERE WAS A DOUBT
HE WONDERED HOW FAR IT WAS
AFTER ALL HE KEPT SAYING TO HIMSELF WHAT GUARANTEE WHAT KNOWLEDGE HAD HE THAT THIS WAS NOT A DAMNED YANKEE TRICK
THE RED SCARF BURNED UPON HER NECK
HIGGINS AND SANDERS CAME TOGETHER--DIRTY APOLOGETIC AND FURTIVE
IT WAS HOT SORE WORK
THEN SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER BARE BROWN FEET AND TORN GOWN
CRESSWELL MENTIONED STILLINGS AS A GOOD INOFFENSIVE NEGRO WHO KNEW HIS PLACE AND COULD BE KEPT TRACK OF
YES GRUMBLED EASTERLY
IS THAT YOU MR COLE
NORTH I DON'T DOUBT BUT THE UNSELFISH WORK SHE DOES--THE UTTER SACRIFICE OH WELL WE'LL OMIT ALABAMA AND ADMIT THE EXCEPTION WELL HERE IN WASHINGTON--THERE'S YOUR FRIEND THE JUDGE WHO HAS BEFRIENDED YOU SO AS YOU ADMIT SHE LAUGHED AGAIN
THEY ROLLED BY BALTIMORE AND PHILADELPHIA AND SHE TALKED OF EVERY-DAY MATTERS
I'M AFTER THE CLOTHES SHE EXPLAINED
CAROLINE WYNN SEEING THE ROCKS FOR WHICH HER POLITICAL CRAFT WAS HEADED ADROITLY STEERED SEVERAL NEWSPAPER REPORTS INTO THE WASTE BASKET BUT STILLINGS SAW TO IT THAT A CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT WAS IN THE COLORED AMERICAN AND THAT A COPY OF THIS PAPER WAS IN CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL'S HANDS
THERE'S SOMETHING DOING HERE
WELL CARRIE HE CRIED EAGERLY
HE SLOWLY PLODDED ON IN BITTER SILENCE TOWARD THE SWAMP
ON THE PORCH AND HAVE MR MAXWELL RIDE UP
TOWARD JOHN TAYLOR HE PERCEPTIBLY WARMED
BUT BEFORE THE MOB ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE JOHNSON FEELING THAT HIS SAFETY LAY IN INFORMING THE WHITE FOLKS HAD CRAWLED WITH HIS GUN INTO THE SWAMP
TO ZORA'S MIND THIS BEAUTIFUL BALED FIBRE WAS HERS
I'M GLAD TO HEAR HE'S ENTERING POLITICS NO I SHALL DO SOME EARLY HOUSE HUNTING IN WASHINGTON SAID MRS CRESSWELL RISING AS MR EASTERLY WAS ANNOUNCED
ISN'T THAT YOUR IDEA MISS SMITH NOT EXACTLY THE LADY REPLIED OR AT LEAST I SHOULDN'T PUT IT JUST THAT WAY
THE OLD WOMAN HURRIED INTO THE BACK GATE JUST AS THE OLD MAN APPEARED TO THE SOUTHWARD ON THE ROAD
MISS WYNN WAS COOLLY BUTTONING HER GLOVE
BLES HURRYING DOWN IN THE MORNING WITH NEW TOOLS AND NEW DETERMINATION STOPPED AND STARED IN BLANK AMAZEMENT
THE FAR AWAY LOOK WAS IN HER EYES AND THEY WERE SHINING
SLOWLY A GREAT CRY ROSE AND SWEPT THE ISLAND
THEN IN SUDDEN NEW FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD TAKEN HIS HAND AND LED HIM THROUGH THE SWAMP SHOWING HIM ALL THE BEAUTY OF HER SWAMP-WORLD--GREAT SHADOWY OAKS AND LIMPID POOLS LONE NAKED TREES AND SWEET FLOWERS
TAYLOR WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HE THRUST THE CLIPPING AT HIM
LOOKING AT HIM SHE SAID
THE BEST PRELIMINARY TO HER PURPOSE WAS SHE KNEW TO SPEAK FRANKLY OF HERSELF AND THAT SHE DID
WHAT'S THE USE MISS SMITH--WHAT OPENING IS THERE FOR A--A NIGGER WITH AN EDUCATION MISS SMITH WAS SHOCKED
A MASTER OF FATE 271 THIRTY
MR EASTERLY FOUND IT COMPARATIVELY EASY TO OVERTHROW THE CORNER BUT THE FLURRY MADE SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS TIMID AND THE TRUST AGREEMENT WAS POSTPONED UNTIL A YEAR LATER
AND SHE BELIEVED THAT THE LOCAL WHITE ARISTOCRACY HELPED BY NORTHERN PHILANTHROPY SHOULD TAKE CHARGE OF SUCH GRADUAL CHANGES
SOME MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR FIELD HANDS ON A HOLIDAY--BUT NOT MANY
THAT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL SIGHED MISS TAYLOR WISTFULLY SINKING TO THE GROUND AND CLASPING HER HANDS ABOUT HER KNEES
AND IF SO HE MUST SPEAK TODAY
SHE FELT THE COLD BODY WHENCE THE WANDERING WRECKED SOUL HAD PASSED
NOW WHAT'S HIS GAME HE ASKED HELPLESSLY
AS IT WAS SHE VIEWED THE HUMAN SCENE WITH DETACHED AND CYNICAL INTEREST
WHO WAS DOING IT
THEN TOO SHE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SHE HAD HAD NOTHING TO EAT
ALTHOUGH I OUGHT TO ADD THAT HE DID NOT THINK THE GIRL WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO PAY
THE WORLD STRETCHED ON AND ON UNTIL IT SEEMED MERE DISTANCE AND SHE SUDDENLY REALIZED HOW VAST A THING IT WAS AND SPOKE
WITH ONE WILD EFFORT THE MAN HURLED HIMSELF OUT THE DOOR AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DARKNESS
OH FATHER IT'S NOBODY BUT EMMA--LITTLE EMMA--BERTIE'S CHILD--THE MULATTO GIRL
ROBERT HERE YOU ARE ALMOST FINISHED AND MY HEART IS SET ON YOUR GOING TO ATLANTA UNIVERSITY AND FINISHING COLLEGE
MORE AND MORE THEREFORE THE WORK MET MISS TAYLOR'S APPROVAL AND SHE TOLD MRS GREY SO
SHE ANSWERED DULLY GROPING FOR WORDS FOR SHE WAS TIRED
A TERM OF FOUR YEARS ABROAD HOWEVER MIGHT BRING HARRY CRESSWELL BACK IN TIME FOR GREATER ADVANCEMENT
SHE STOOD ABOVE HER IN HER SILKEN MORNING-GOWN HER BROWN AND GRAY SPRINKLED HAIR RISING ABOVE THE PALE STRONG-LINED FACE
HE WAS AN INTRUDER
BANG HARD KNUCKLES WERE BEATING UPON THE DOOR BELOW
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT COST AS MUCH AS TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT A THOUSAND DOLLARS YES SIR
THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS--ONE THING
MRS GREY LOOKED HELPLESSLY AT HER COMPANIONS
HE FANCIED ZORA CARED LESS FOR HIS COMPANY AND HE GAVE HER LESS AND THEN WAS PUZZLED TO FIND TIME HANGING SO EMPTY SO WRETCHEDLY EMPTY ON HIS HANDS
SO INVOLUNTARILY ALMOST SHE HAUNTED THE COTTON STOREHOUSE FLITTING LIKE A DARK AND SILENT GHOST IN AMONG THE WORKMEN GREETING THEM WITH HER LOW MUSICAL VOICE WARDING THEM WITH THE COLD MAJESTY OF HER EYES
HE CAUGHT IT LIGHTLY AND SMILED SORROWFULLY INTO HER EYES
HIS EYES STRAYED TO THE PORCH WHERE HIS PRETTY SISTER SAT LANGUIDLY AND THEN TOWARD THE SCHOOL WHERE THE OTHER SISTER LIVED
NEXT MORNING THE LONG SHINING WIRES OF THAT GREAT BROADWAY WEB TREMBLED AND FLASHED AGAIN AND COTTON WENT TO TEN CENTS
CAN'T RAISE WAGES GENTLEMEN AND CAN'T LESSEN HOURS
OF COURSE SHE MANAGED TO CONTINUE WE ARE VERY SORRY THAT WE CANNOT RECEIVE IT INDEED
HE WENT HOME AND TOLD ZORA AND SHE LISTENED WITHOUT SURPRISE
BUT THERE WAS NO FEELING NO PASSION NO LOVE
AND UNDERNEATH THE LAND LAY CAREFULLY DRAINED AND BLACK
ON THE WAY UP TOWN SHE CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE CHANCE OF SUCCESS
THE BALANCE IS FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT DOLLARS SAID MISS SMITH
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER SLIGHT TIRED SCRATCHED BUT UNDAUNTED STRIVING BLINDLY TOWARD THE LIGHT WITH STANCH UNFALTERING FAITH
BLES SHE SAID PRIMLY HAVE YOU ABSOLUTELY NO SHAME HE BRACED HIMSELF AND RAISED HIS HEAD PROUDLY
HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
SHE IS A FACT IN MY WORLD
AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HE STILL SAT SILENT ELBOW ON KNEE ABSENTLY FLICKING THE JOGGING HORSE AND STARING AHEAD AT THE HORIZON
HE IS KNOWN ONLY AS A SELFISH MILLIONAIRE WHO THINKS MORE OF HORSES THAN OF MEN CARELESSLY MRS VANDERPOOL THREW THE PAPER TO THE FLOOR AND BIT HER LIPS AS THE ANGRY BLOOD DYED HER FACE
BUT FRANKLY I CANNOT MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE IN IT
BUT SHE ADOPTED THEM FROM READING AND CONVERSATION AFTER HESITATING FOR A YEAR BEFORE SUCH PUZZLING CONTRADICTIONS AS BLES ALWYN AND HARRY CRESSWELL
WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER IN THESE DAYS THEY FOUND LESS TO TALK ABOUT AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SILVER FLEECE WHICH IN MAGIC WILFULNESS OPENED BOTH THEIR MOUTHS THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR COMPANIONSHIP LITTLE MORE THAN A SERIES OF AWKWARD SILENCES
BUT MR CRESSWELL YOU SURELY BELIEVE IN SCHOOLS LIKE MISS SMITH'S DECIDEDLY RETURNED MR CRESSWELL WITH ENTHUSIASM IT HAS DONE GREAT GOOD MRS GREY WAS GRATIFIED AND MURMURED SOMETHING OF MISS SMITH'S SACRIFICE POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
SHE STARTED ALMOST GUILTILY AND AGAIN A SENSE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER POSITION REDDENED HER FACE AND NECK
HE LAUGHED IN THE BOLD COURAGE OF DAY AND STRETCHED HIMSELF
THIS IS NOT A REBUKE BUT A CLUMSY WARNING
I WANTS A LITTLE HOME TO DIE IN MISS SMITH'S THROAT SWELLED
HE PAUSED AND SMILED AT HIM
MISS TAYLOR STOPPED HIM FOR HE LOOKED INTERESTING AND MIGHT ANSWER SOME OF HER BROTHER'S QUESTIONS
SHE THOUGHT OF HARRY CRESSWELL AND THE TALE HE TOLD HER IN THE SWAMP
HOW OFTEN HAD SHE HEARD THAT DEADENING PHRASE IN THE LAST YEAR!--"THAT THERE'S NO USE
IT COST FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR TO RUN THE SCHOOL AND THIS SUM SHE RAISED WITH INCREASINGLY GREATER DIFFICULTY
A HUSH FELL ON THE THRONG
A MOMENT MARY HESITATED TOO AND THEN TURNED RESOLUTELY TO GREET HER
THE FOREST TREMBLED AS BY SOME MIGHTY MAGIC SWAYING AND FALLING WITH CRASH ON CRASH
WE SIMPLY CAN'T KEEP THE COST OF COTTON DOWN TO A REMUNERATIVE FIGURE WITH NIGGERS GETTING SCARCER AND DEARER
YOUR SERVANT MA'AM AND THE SWAMP SWALLOWED HIM
THAT'LL BE NICE
ZORA NEVER FORGOT HOW THEY FOUND THE FIRST WHITE FLOWER IN THAT GREEN AND BILLOWING SEA NOR HER LOW CRY OF PLEASURE AND HIS GAY SHOUT OF JOY
FROM SUCH A FATE SHE WOULD SAVE ZORA AND BLES
HE DETERMINED NOT TO LET THE BAD FEELINGS GO TOO FAR AND WHEN A PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING ACCIDENT TO A LITTLE GIRL TOOK PLACE HE SHOWED MORE THAN HIS USUAL INTEREST AND OFFERED TO CARE FOR HER
SHE IS IS SHE HE EXCLAIMED
SOMETIMES BLES HELPS ME ADDED MISS SMITH GUILEFULLY
SHE KNEW SHE WAS TAKING A CRITICAL STEP
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING
BERTIE SHE CRIED AS SHE SEIZED THE MOTHER OF LITTLE EMMA BY THE ARM
PERHAPS--I DO ZORA
THERE SHE FOUND GOD AFTER A SEARCHING THAT HAD SEARED HER SOUL
OTHER CHILDREN DOCTOR YOU MUST HAVE NO OTHER CHILDREN MR CRESSWELL WHY BECAUSE THE SINS OF THE FATHERS ARE VISITED UPON THE CHILDREN UNTO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION SLOWLY SOFTLY SHE CREPT AWAY
TODD JUST LET FALL SOMETHING OF A COMBINATION AGAINST US IN CONGRESS--KNOW ANYTHING OF IT NOT DEFINITELY
MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS TEN AND LEFT ME TO HER TENDER MERCIES
AT THE SAME TIME SHE LAID TEN DOLLARS OF HER FIRST HARD-EARNED MONEY IN HIS HANDS
IT PAYS TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED
NOW GO THIRTY THE RETURN OF ZORA I NEVER REALIZED BEFORE JUST WHAT A LIE MEANT SAID ZORA
WHOM DO YOU THINK THAT'S FOR HELEN HELEN HE RAISED HIS HAND IN THREATENING ANGER
ALL THE SCHOOL-MA'AM IN HER LEAPED TO HIS TEACHING
SHE DID NOT RETURN THE GREETING BUT HE FOUND HER PAUSING AT THE GATE
MISS SMITH TRIED NOT TO NOTICE THE CHANGE
NOW IF THE SECURITY WERE AMPLE I THINK PERHAPS YOU MIGHT GET THIS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MISS SMITH GREW WHITE
EVERY YEAR I HAVE TO PINCH EM CLOSER AND CLOSER
ZORA FROZE WATCHING THE DOOR WIDE-EYED WHILE THE FIRE FLAMED REDDER
NO--DON'T TALK--I'M BAD--BUT I'VE GOT A LITTLE GIRL MISS SMITH TEN YEARS OLD AND--AND--I'M AFRAID FOR HER
SHE WAS STAYING WITH THE COLONEL AT CRESSWELL OAKS
BUT TO THE LEFT AND AT THE END OF THE PORCH WAS A SMALL BUILDING
BUT HE WAS DOING IT MECHANICALLY AND FROM LONG HABIT AND WAS REALLY THINKING HOW CHARMING A GIRL HELEN CRESSWELL WAS
THE BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
A STRAIGHT DESK OF ROUGH HEWN WOOD STOOD IN THE CORNER BY THE WHITE-CURTAINED WINDOW AND A COUCH AND TWO LARGE EASY-CHAIRS FACED A TALL NARROW FIREPLACE OF UNEVEN STONE
BUT CAN'T WE FORCE THEM TO IT ONLY BY POLITICAL POWER AND THEY'VE JUST WON A CAMPAIGN THEY WON IT BY NEGRO VOTES AND THE NEGRO WHO SECURED THE VOTES IS EAGER FOR THIS BILL
CHIEFLY NOTICEABLE HOWEVER TO A STRANGER IN THE VAST VARIETY OF COLOR IN SKIN WHICH IMPARTED TO THE THRONG A PIQUANT AND UNUSUAL INTEREST
BUT TAYLOR WHO HAD JUST SUCCESSFULLY STOPPED A SUIT FOR DAMAGES TO THE INJURED BOY MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF WORKING FOR WAGES AND SHE HAS NOT THE SERVANT'S HUMILITY
SHE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER ALWYN COULD DO THE WORK OR NOT
MARY CRESSWELL WALKED SLOWLY ON FLUSHING AND PALING BY TURNS
I HAVE FOUND THE WAY SHE CRIED JOYOUSLY
AT THE EDGE OF THE ORGY STOOD ZORA WILD-EYED AND BEWILDERED MAD WITH THE PAIN THAT GRIPPED HER HEART AND HAMMERED IN HER HEAD CRYING IN TUNE WITH THE FRENZIED MUSIC--"THE END--THE END ABRUPTLY SHE RECOGNIZED A FACE DESPITE THE WRECK AND RUIN OF ITS BEAUTY
THEN HE RODE TO TOWN AND TOLD TAYLOR AGAIN OF HIS FEARS OF A LABOR MOVEMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE WHITES AND BLACKS
TOO HIGH FOR US TO FLY MRS CRESSWELL WINCED
I'VE MADE MY WILL WHY--WHY SHE STAMMERED
I'SE BEEN TO JEDGE GREY--I USE TO TOTE HIM ON MY KNEE HONEY--I'SE BEEN TO HIM TO PLEAD HIM NOT TO LET EM GO ON DE GANG CAUSE YOU SEE HONEY AND SHE STROKED THE GIRL'S SLEEVE AS IF PLEADING WITH HER TOO YOU SEE IT DONE RUINS BOYS TO PUT EM ON DE GANG MISS TAYLOR TRIED HARD TO THINK OF SOMETHING COMFORTING TO SAY BUT WORDS SEEMED INADEQUATE TO CHEER THE OLD SOUL
SHOULD HE BE ONE
HE LEANED AGAINST HIS HOE AND TALKED HALF DREAMILY--WHERE HAD HE LEARNED SO WELL THAT DREAM-TALK
HE FIDGETED THEN SPOKE RAPIDLY
THERE ARE SCORES THOUSANDS PERHAPS MILLIONS SUCH I ADMIT
SLOWLY WITH NO WORD THE INTRUDERS TURNED AND WENT SILENTLY AWAY LEAVING BUT ONE LATE COMER WHO PRESSED FORWARD
HOW ABOUT FIGHTING FOR EXERCISE SHE SUGGESTED
THEY JUST THINKS THEY RULE
BUT HE GOT OVER THAT AND YOU STRAIGHTENED HIM OUT FINALLY
NOW OUR PLAN IS TO TAKE NO CHANCES
THE END OF ZORA'S HOPES
THIS MAN WITHOUT DOUBT REPRESENTED MONEY
OUGHT I TO TELL
I WANT NO PRAYERS SHE CRIED I WILL NOT PRAY
THE COTTON MILL 339 THIRTY-SIX
WITH OTHERS HE DID NOT SPEAK
HE HAD FARED FORTH TO BECKONING HANDS AND LURING AND TO THE EAGER HUM OF HUMAN VOICES AS OF SOME GREAT SWELLING MUSIC
WITH TREMBLING HANDS SHE DREW THE SILVER FLEECE ROUND HER
THE LAND 350 THIRTY-SEVEN
ONLY THE CLERK WAS THERE AND HE WAS CLOSING
AND WHILE SHE DID NOT TRY TO REGAIN THE AFFECTION SHE STROVE TO ENTHRALL HIS INTELLECT
BUT SHE WAS CONTENT FOR SHE WAS ALMOST ALONE
WHY IN ABRUPT RECOGNITION IT IS OUR VENUS OF THE ROADSIDE IS IT NOT MARY SAW IT WAS ZORA
FOR EXAMPLE SHE HAD NOT OBJECTED TO WINE AT DINNER
OH TEMPORARILY JOHN TAYLOR ADMITTED
I MUST GO
I MUST GO
MARY TAYLOR FLUSHED AND MRS GREY CRIED FRANKLY
GOD IS DONE SENT ME TO OFFER YOU ALL SALVATION HE CRIED WHILE THE PEOPLE WEPT AND WAILED
I AM A SCHOOL-TEACHER SENATOR SMITH AND LIKE ALL THE REST OF US I AM DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEW SCHOOL-BOARD BUT YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT COMMITTEE ATTENDS TO THOSE THINGS SAID THE SENATOR HASTILY
NEW COTTON SHOOK GLIMMERED AND BLOSSOMED IN THE BLACK FIELDS AND OVER ALL THE SOFT SOUTHERN SUN POURED ITS AWAKENING LIGHT OF LIFE
HAVE YOU SEEN SENATOR SMITH YET MISS WYNN ASKED AFTER A FEW WORDS OF CONGRATULATION
COLONEL CRESSWELL WILL BE AWAY THEN SHE PAUSED ABRUPTLY
IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SUCH A MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO WITH MRS GREY'S PHILANTHROPIES--AT LEAST IN HIS PRESENT POSITION
SHE STARTED UP AND HER EYE FELL UPON A LETTER LYING ON HER BUREAU
IT'S MY LEG AGAIN MASTER HARRY--THE LEG WHAT I HURT IN THE GIN LAST FALL HE ANSWERED UNEASILY
IT WAS SO LOW AND CALM IT CAME AS THOUGH JOURNEYING FROM GREAT DISTANCES AND WEARY WITH TRAVEL
THEN ALWYN WOULD GO WEARILY AWAY VEXED OR DISAPPOINTED OR MERELY SAD AND BOTH WOULD TURN TO THEIR WORK AGAIN
MY GOD TAYLOR HE GASPED
THE AXE TOO IN SOME INDISTINCT WAY FELT GOOD IN HIS HAND
SHE NEITHER LOOKED NOR STIRRED BUT KEPT WHISPERING TO HERSELF WITH SOMETHING LIKE AWE
HE'S NOWHERE DOWNSTAIRS HE WAVERED AND SCOWLED
SHE WOULD NOT TURN OVER THE DIRECTION OF THE SCHOOL OR THE DIRECTION OF THE EDUCATION OF THESE PEOPLE TO THOSE WHO WERE MOST OPPOSED TO THEIR EDUCATION
ZORA COME RIGHT OUT OF THIS
THE UNINITIATED CANNOT EASILY PICTURE TO HIMSELF THE MENTAL ATTITUDE OF A FORMER SLAVEHOLDER TOWARD PROPERTY IN THE HANDS OF A NEGRO
HARRY CRESSWELL DROPPED HIS EYES AND ON MRS VANDERPOOL'S LIPS THE SMILE DIED
I CAN'T THINK IT RIGHT OR WISE TO REPLACE THE OLD ARISTOCRACY BY NEW AND UNTRIED BLOOD AND IN A SUDDEN OUTBURST--"BUT BY GOD SIR
HE HAD NOT AND SHE SHOWED HIM A SOFA PILLOW
DEN DE BOYS DONE GOT IN DAT TROUBLE AND HE PAID THEIR FINES WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WELL ONE WAS A-GAMBLING AND THE OTHER STRUCK THE OVERSEER WHAT WAS A-WHIPPIN HIM WHIPPING HIM!"--IN HORRIFIED EXCLAMATION QUITE AS MUCH AT AUNT RACHEL'S MATTER-OF-FACT WAY OF REGARDING THE MATTER AS AT THE DEED ITSELF
BUT HE HAD LEFT HER ON HER KNEES IN THE DIRT WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND SOMEHOW HE HAD EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SOME CORRESPONDING MENTAL ATTITUDE
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
WHERE IS SHE
MR CRESSWELL SHE SAID SERIOUSLY I KNOW VERY WELL THAT IT WOULDN'T DO FOR YOUR SISTER TO CALL HERE AND I SHA'N'T MIND A BIT COMING BY TO SEE HER FIRST
MARY HIS VOICE ABRUPTLY STRUCK A NEW NOTE
WITH HER FOLK HARD WORK AND INFLEXIBLE DUTY WERE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE
SHE KNEW THE SUSPICIOUS TEMPER OF THE TOWN WHITES
IT IS TOO BAD THAT YOUR WORK DEPRIVES YOU OF THE SOCIETY OF PEOPLE OF YOUR CLASS
BUT ON THE FIRST SUNDAY IT WOKE TO SUDDEN MIGHTY LIFE
SHE MUST BE PAID WELL FOR IT COLONEL CRESSWELL GLANCED AT HIM WITH SOMETHING BETWEEN CONTEMPT AND ASTONISHMENT ON HIS FACE
THE HARVEST IS WAITING
SHE SENT THE GIRLS HOME AT DUSK AND THEN SEATED HERSELF MISERABLY UNDER THE GREAT OAK
MISS HELEN WILL BE DREADFUL SORRY BUT SHE AND THE COLONEL HAVE JUST GONE TO TOWN--I BELIEVE HER AUNTY AIN'T WELL MR CRESSWELL LOOKED ANNOYED
THE BUILDINGS COST FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO GIVE TO THE NIGGERS AND CHINAMEN HE SNORTED TO JOHN TAYLOR AND STRODE UP AND DOWN THE VERANDA
SECOND PLACE YOU CAN'T GET IT WORKED
WHEN HE CAME IN HE GLANCED AT THE MORNING PAPER BEFORE LOOKING OVER HIS MAIL AND THE LIST OF HIS CALLERS
YOUR LITTLE HANDS ARE MUCH TOO FRAIL FOR WORK THEY MUST GROW LARGER THEN AND SOON YOUR FEET ARE FAR TOO SMALL TO TRAVEL ON THEY'LL TRAVEL ON TO YOU--THAT'S FAR ENOUGH YOUR LIPS--YOUR FULL AND PURPLE LIPS--WERE MADE ALONE FOR KISSING NOT FOR WORDS THEY'LL DO FOR BOTH HE LAUGHED IN UTTER JOY AND TOUCHED HER HAIR WITH LIGHT CARESSING HANDS
IT HAD SEEMINGLY BOUNDED FORWARD IN A NIGHT AND IT MUST BE HOED FORTHWITH
I DON'T DESERVE IT I RECKON TWO YEARS WITH HARRY WAS WORTH ABOUT THAT MUCH HE RETURNED GRIMLY
AT ALL HAZARDS HE MUST WIN AND HE CAST THE DIE
THE RED FLAME OF THE FIRELIGHT SET THE GOLD TO DANCING IN HER HAIR
TWENTY-TWO MISS CAROLINE WYNN BLES ALWYN WAS SEATED IN THE ANTEROOM OF SENATOR SMITH'S OFFICE IN WASHINGTON
A FEW GOOD PICTURES WERE ON THE WALLS AND MRS CRESSWELL WAS EXAMINING ONE WHEN SHE HEARD THE SWISH OF SILKEN SKIRTS
DOWN IN THE BOTTOMS WEST OF THE SWAMP A MAN AND WOMAN WERE FIGURING PAINFULLY ON AN OLD SLATE
SHE FROWNED
BUT SHE WAS SLIGHT ALMOST SCRAWNY AND HER BEAUTY WAS GONE FOREVER
SHE WAS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED BUT HER MIND WAS CLEAR
HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO SHE WENT OUT AND PARADED THE STREETS WATCHING THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HAPPY ENOUGH TO BE BUSY
AT LAST HOWEVER SHE SAID HAPPILY TO ZORA
WELL BEGAN MR EASTERLY
BLES SOUGHT TO GUIDE THE OLD WOMAN BUT HE FOUND SHE KNEW THE WAY BETTER THAN HE DID
NOT ONLY ARE THE NEGROES ENTHUSED BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS DAILY LETTERS FROM PROMINENT WHITES THE STRONG INFLUENCE IS NAMED VANDERPOOL EASTERLY DRILY REMARKED
IN THE MIDST OF THIS PURSUIT THE TRUTH OCCURRED TO HER--ZORA HAD STOLEN IT
THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE
THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE
IT MUST BE IN MY ROOM
WE ARE YOU KNOW IN THE MIDST OF A RATHER WARM PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN CONTINUED MR EASTERLY
AND AS SHE STOOD THERE AWED WITH THE MYSTICAL UNION OF A DEAD LOVE AND A LIVING NEW BORN SELF THERE CAME DRIFTING IN AT THE WINDOW FAINTLY THE SOFT SOUND OF FAR-OFF MARRIAGE MUSIC
HE KNEW THAT GREY WAS POOR AND LESS KNOWING THAN HE SIXTY YEARS AGO
AND NOW THE COUNTRY TOWN OF TOOMSVILLE LIFTED ITSELF ABOVE THE COTTON AND CORN FRINGED WITH DIRTY STRAGGLING CABINS OF BLACK FOLK
THEN SLOWLY ALMOST PAINFULLY SHE TOOK THE PATH BACK TO THE FIELD OF THE FLEECE AND REACHING IT AFTER LONG LONG MINUTES BEGAN MECHANICALLY TO PICK THE COTTON
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN GET A LUNCH SEARCH ME HE ANSWERED LOUNGING INTO A SEAT
WITH SWAYING WHIRLING FIGURES MUSIC AND LAUGHTER AND ALL THE HUMAN FUN OF GAYETY AND CONVERSE
AND YET HARRY MY BOY THIS COTTON-GROWING BUSINESS IS GETTING IN A PRETTY TIGHT PINCH
ALWYN TURNED SLOWLY AWAY
PITY SURGED AND FOUGHT IN HIS BREAST
HELL
THE SENATOR HAD NOT COME IN YET AND THERE WERE OTHERS WAITING TOO
I HAVE FOOD AND CLOTHES
SO THE WORLD WAS HAPPY AND THE FACE OF THE BLACK-BELT GREEN AND LUXURIANT WITH THICKENING FLECKS OF THE COMING FOAM OF THE COTTON
BUT TEACH THEM HOW TO HANDLE A HOE AND TO SEW AND COOK
WE'LL LOOK IT OVER TO-MORROW THEY TURNED PRESENTLY TO WHERE THEY COULD SEE THE CRESSWELL OAKS WAVING LAZILY IN THE SUNLIGHT AND THE WHITE GLEAM OF THE PILLARED BIG HOUSE A PAUSE AT THE CRESSWELL STORE WHERE MR CRESSWELL ENTERED AFFORDED MARY TAYLOR AN OPPORTUNITY FURTHER TO EXTEND HER FUND OF INFORMATION
HERE ARE THINGS FOR YOU TO WEAR SHE POINTED OUT OPENING THE BUREAU AND HERE IS THE BATH-ROOM SHE LEFT THE GIRL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR
WHY WAS SHE DRIFTING IN VAST WATERS
ZORA KISSED HER
IT WAS IN THE LOFTY WAITING-ROOM OF THE WASHINGTON STATION WHERE ALWYN HAD COME TO MEET A FRIEND
A MOMENT SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED BACK
A MOMENT SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED BACK
AT FIRST IN THE DIM GLORIES OF THE HONEYMOON THIS SEEMED BUT PART OF HIS DELICATE COURTESY TOWARD HER AND IT PLEASED HER DESPITE HER THRIFTY NEW ENGLAND NATURE
ONLY I THINK IF YOUR BROTHER KNEW HE WILL KNOW IN A VERY FEW WEEKS
SHE FELT THAT OVERPOWERING FANATICISM BACK WITHIN HER RAGING RESTLESSLY
IT CALLED AND I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT WAS HER TALISMAN NEW-FOUND
MARY OF SCOTLAND AND JOAN OF ARC HELD HER DARK HANDS IN THEIRS AND KINGS LIFTED UP THEIR SCEPTRES
IT'S A CRUEL FALSEHOOD HE MOANED
DESPITE HERSELF MISS TAYLOR CAUGHT THE ALLEGORY AND HALF WHISPERED LO
IT WAS DISTINCTIVELY DISCONCERTING TO COLONEL CRESSWELL TO FIND HARRY QUITE IN FAVOR OF EARLY NUPTIALS AND TO LEARN THAT THE SOLE OBJECTION EVEN IN HELEN'S MIND WAS THE IMPROBABILITY OF GETTING A WEDDING-GOWN IN TIME
THEN TO THE MAN
SHE HEARD DROWSILY AND DREAMED THAT IT WAS THE NAILING UP OF ALL HER DOORS
THAT'S THE REASON I'M HERE
BY A SUPERHUMAN MIRACLE SHE HAD RISEN AND SEATED HERSELF ABOVE HIM
SHE DISMISSED HIM
SHE WAS PAYING HIGH FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TALKING BUT IT HAD TO BE SAID
OUT OF A NEBULOUS CLOUDLAND SHE SEEMED TO STEP
COME IN SHE COMMANDED BRIEFLY MOTIONING THE WOMAN TO A CHAIR
BUT HARRY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I RECKON I'LL MAKE THE BARGAIN ALL RIGHT
HOW IS MY SISTER HE ASKED ABSENTLY
BUT SHE WAS NO LONGER DREAMING NOW
AND AS SHE CHANTED DEEP HARSH TONES CAME BOOMING THROUGH THE FOREST
MR EASTERLY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN STATE COMMITTEE OF NEW JERSEY HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO DISCIPLINE MR SMITH PRETTY SEVERELY FOR CERTAIN SOCIALISTIC VOTES IN THE HOUSE AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS FUTURE CAREER WAS UNCERTAIN
BLES SHE SAID THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN LAYING A PRETTY SHREWD TRAP FOR YOU WHAT HE ASKED ABSENTLY
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT SAID COLONEL CRESSWELL CHEERILY FOR THIS TO HIS MIND WAS EVIDENCE OF SENSE ON THE PART OF THE NEGROES
HE NOTED MRS VANDERPOOL AND THOUGHT HER TOO THIN AND PALE
SOCIAL EQUALITY CANNOT BE FORCED
AND--JUST AS CERTAINLY--HER HUSBAND DIDN'T
DON'T WE OWN THE MILL
IT'S MANIPULATION AND SPECULATION IN NEW YORK SAID COLONEL CRESSWELL AND THE FARMERS LEAGUE MUST BEGIN OPERATIONS THE LOCAL PAPER SOON HAD AN EDITORIAL ON OUR DISTINGUISHED FELLOW CITIZEN COLONEL CRESSWELL AND HIS EFFORTS TO REVIVE THE FARMERS LEAGUE
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU KNOW ANY ONE WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH ANY NUMBER OF THESE NORTHERN DARKIES CONTINUED MR EASTERLY
WE'SE KNOWN US ALL OUR LIVES TWO THE SCHOOL DAY WAS BREAKING ABOVE THE WHITE BUILDINGS OF THE NEGRO SCHOOL AND THROWING LONG LOW LINES OF GOLD IN AT MISS SARAH SMITH'S FRONT WINDOW
E
AND THE BUILDINGS WERE SO TALL AND SILENT AGAINST HEAVEN
SHE GREETED HIM BRIEFLY AND ASKED HIM IN
THICK MEMORIES OF SOME FORGOTTEN PAST CAME PILING IN UPON HER
NO SOONER DID SHE KNOW HERSELF WELL OUT OF HIS SIGHT THAN SHE DROPPED LIGHTLY DOWN BESIDE THE PATH LISTENING INTENTLY UNTIL THE LAST ECHO OF HIS FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY
WHO'S THAT NIGGER WITH ONE OF THEM NIGGER TEACHERS WELL THEY'LL STOP THIS DAMN RIDING AROUND OR THEY'LL HEAR SOMETHING AND THEY RODE SLOWLY BY
ZORA SHE SAID EVENLY WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO CLASS WHEN I CALLED I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAID ZORA LOOKING AT HER FULL-EYED AND TELLING THE HALF-TRUTH EASILY
OF COURSE SHE WAS SIMPLY A BLACK GIRL BUT SHE WAS AN EDUCATED WOMAN WHO KNEW THINGS ABOUT THE CRESSWELL PLANTATIONS THAT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO AIR IN COURT
I'LL DRIVE BY AND SEE HE SAID CARELESSLY
WHY HAD SHE ASKED FOR THIS GIRL
I--I WAS JUST GOING ON AN ERRAND FOR MISS SMITH SHE CRIED
I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM
SUCH AN EXAMPLE BEFORE THE TENANTS OF THE BLACK BELT WOULD BE FATAL
BUT MARK WHAT I SAY A NIGGER WILL PRESUME ON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT AND YOU MUST KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACE
HE PICTURED HER HUDDLED THERE IN THE SWAMP IN THE CHEERLESS LEAKY CABIN WITH WORSE THAN NO COMPANIONS
HE TOOK A PRIMER FROM HIS POCKET AND LIGHTING A MATCH SHOWED HER THE ALPHABET
BUT ZORA WAS TOO TIRED TO NOTICE MUCH AND SHE WAS DOZING WEARILY WHEN SHE FELT A TOUCH ON THE ARM AND FOUND THE PORTER IN THE SEAT BESIDE HER WITH HIS ARM THROWN FAMILIARLY BEHIND HER ALONG THE TOP OF THE BACK
NOT NEARLY SO BEAUTIFUL
STRANGE CARVEN BEASTS GAZED ON FROM A SETTING OF RICH BARBARIC SPLENDOR AND SHE HERSELF--THE LIAR--LAY IN RAGS BEFORE THE GOLD AND IVORY OF THAT LOFTY THRONE WHEREON SAT ZORA
COLORED WOMEN WOULD LOOK AS WELL AS THAT HE ARGUED WITH THE CLOTHES AND WEALTH AND TRAINING
THE AWAKENING WAS THE WORK OF DAYS AND WEEKS
BUT THERE LAY A LIGHT IN HER EYES
I WAS READING AND I FORGOT SHE SAID
MARY SLIPPED STRAIGHT ACROSS TO HIM AND LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE
WHO'S IT BLES THE MOTHER OF GOD HE ANSWERED REVERENTLY
IT'S ONLY A BLOCK
AT ANY RATE IT WAS THE ONLY TANGIBLE OFFERING AND MARY CRESSWELL SILENTLY DETERMINED TO WORK FOR IT
HE EXPRESSED AGAIN HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AT HIS SISTER'S ABSENCE
SHE SWAYED AND WOULD HAVE CRASHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE IF JUST THEN SHE HAD NOT SEEN AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE HALL NEAR THE BACK STAIRS ZORA AND ALWYN EMERGE CALMLY FROM A ROOM CARRYING A BASKET FULL OF CLOTHES
DEN IT WAS A BALE AND A HALF TO THE ACRE ON STALKS DAT LOOKED LIKE YOUNG BRUSHWOOD
WAS NOT ALL HER LIFE SIMPLY THE WANT OF HIM?--WHY HAD SHE NOT BOUND HIM TO HER WHEN HE HAD OFFERED HIMSELF
WILL YOU HEAR
WHEREUPON MISS WYNN COMPOSED HERSELF WAVED GAYLY AT A PASSING ACQUAINTANCE AND MATCHED SOME RIBBONS IN A DEPARTMENT STORE
SHUT UP ALWYN STARTED AGAIN
AND SOCIETY MISS TAYLOR ARGUED ONE MUST HAVE EVEN IN ALABAMA
H'M I SEE HE OWNED
YET IT WAS DONE
INDEED SHE HAD FOUND LYING CUSTOMARY IN THIS COMMUNITY AND SHE HAD A NEW ENGLAND HORROR OF IT
MARY CRESSWELL HAD LISTENED BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE HER WORLD SEEMED SO SMALL AND SORDID AND NARROW SO TRIVIAL THAT A SENSE OF SHAME SPREAD OVER HER
IS THAT YOU SMITH WELL THIS IS EASTERLY
A LAMB FOR THE SLAUGHTER BUT HE PATIENTLY LISTENED TO HIM PLEAD FOR PARTY SUPPORT AND INFLUENCE FOR HIS BILL TO PROHIBIT GAMBLING IN FUTURES
ALL YOU SAY MAY BE TRUE
THE WOMEN WHOM HE BENT ABOVE IN LANGUID VEILED-EYED HOMAGE FEARED LEST THEY LOVE HIM AND WHAT WORK WAS TO OTHERS GAMBLING WAS TO HIM
THEY PAID HER COMPLIMENTS WHICH SHE DID NOT BELIEVE AND THEY DID NOT EXPECT HER TO BELIEVE
MISS SMITH SEIZED UPON IT AS AN OMEN OF SALVATION
SLOWLY ZORA'S HANDS FELL AND HER EYES BLINKED AS THOUGH WAKING FROM SOME AWFUL DREAM
EACH DAY AFRAID OF SOME LAST PARTING EACH NIGHT TRIUMPHANT--IT WAS STILL THERE
BUT MISS SMITH PLUNGED INTO HER SUBJECT
BUT HE FETCHED NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SCISSORS TOO
INDEED
WHAT'S THE MATTER ROB SHE ASKED
THE LONG SHADOWS OF THE SWAMP SWEPT SOFT COOLNESS ON THE RED ROAD
MRS VANDERPOOL CONSIDERED
AS FOR HERSELF ONCE SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE MARRIAGE AND PAID THE MORTGAGE ON THE SCHOOL OUT OF HER LEGACY SHE WOULD GO ABROAD AND IN TRAVEL SEEK FORGETFULNESS AND HEALING
THE RHYTHM OF THEIR STAMPING THE SHOUT OF THEIR VOICES AND THE WILD MUSIC OF THEIR SINGING SHOOK THE NIGHT
THE TRUST IS GOING THROUGH CAPITALIZATION AT A BILLION
SHE HAD UNWITTINGLY MADE THE INTIMACY AND HE WAS BUT A NEGRO LOOKING ON EVERY WHITE WOMAN AS A GODDESS AND READY TO FAWN AT THE SLIGHTEST ENCOURAGEMENT
MARY WAS BUSY WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND SHE DID NOT NOTICE THE OTHER WOMAN'S MANNER
I'LL BE IN EARLIER TONIGHT HE DECLARED
CRESSWELL AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND CAME SLOWLY TO THE WIDE FLAT DESK WHERE TAYLOR WAS WORKING FEVERISHLY
I THINK IT WAS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS
SHE WAS WHITE AND SANDY-HAIRED
POOR LITTLE CHRIST-BABY BLES HESITATED AND BEFORE HE FOUND WORDS ZORA WAS SAYING
SHORT CROP AND BIG DEMAND COTTON IS GOING UP AND THEN IT'S GOING TO FALL I DON'T BELIEVE IT I KNOW IT
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE COME ON
SHE GLANCED OUT FROM HER SEAT ON THE UPPER VERANDAH OVER THE FRONT PORCH AND SAW ALWYN COMING
BEFORE SUNRISE TOOLS WERE IN THE SWAMP AXES AND SAWS AND HAMMERS
BUT ZORA DEIGNED NO ANSWER
MISS TAYLOR HURRIED OUT FORGETTING HER PIN
STILL HELEN WAS QUERULOUS
SHE CORRESPONDS WITH HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN
ARE KISSES ILLEGAL HERE SHE ASKED BEFORE THE HORSES STARTED TURNING THE BATTERY OF HER EYES FULL UPON HIM
BUT THAT WOULD RIGHT ITSELF IN TIME SHE WAS SURE
CREEPING TOWARD THEM DOWN THE ROAD ROLLED A DARK SQUAT FIGURE
HERE OPINIONS DIFFERED WIDELY
SHE HAD NOT MEANT TO LISTEN BUT NOW TO HER DESPERATE LONGING TO KEEP HIM HOME WAS ADDED A NEW MOTIVE
YOU'RE A CRESSWELL AND YOU MUST HOLD YOURSELF TOO HIGH TO MISTER A NIGGER OR LET HIM DREAM OF ANY SORT OF EQUALITY HE SPOKE PLEASANTLY BUT WITH A CERTAIN SHARP INSISTENCE THAT STRUCK A NOTE OF FEAR IN MARY'S HEART
HER DRESS AND TASTE IN ADORNMENT HAD BEEN MRS VANDERPOOL'S FIRST CARE AND IT LED TO A CURIOUS TRAINING IN ART AND SENSE OF BEAUTY UNTIL THE LADY NOW AND THEN FOUND HERSELF LEARNER BEFORE THE QUICK SUGGESTIVENESS OF ZORA'S MIND
HE MAY HELP
A MAN OWED THE WORLD SUCCESS
IT IS AN EVIL PLACE AND HAS MEANT EVIL FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND FOR ME
IT WOULD BE FATAL TO GIVE SUCH A MAN OFFICE AND INFLUENCE
IT SEEMED THAT MR VANDERPOOL HAD GONE HUNTING AND HIS WIFE HAD NOT YET ARISEN
COME MOVE ON HE BRUSQUELY ORDERED
IT IS MEANINGLESS THE WOMAN'S CYNICISM WAS LOST UPON ZORA OF COURSE BUT IT POSSESSED THE SALUTARY EFFECT OF STIMULATING THE GIRL'S THOUGHTS ENCOURAGING HER TO DISCOVER FOR HERSELF
A SILENCE FELL LIKE A LIGHTNING FLASH ON THE ROOM AS THAT WHITE FACE PEERED IN AT THE DOOR
THEN YOU HAVE STOLEN IT AND YOU ARE A THIEF STILL ZORA APPEARED TO BE UNIMPRESSED WITH THE HEINOUSNESS OF HER FAULT
WORK WITH HIM
THIS GIRL ON THE OTHER HAND JUST LOUNGED AND LISTENED WITH AN AMUSED SMILE OR ASKED THE MOST CHILD-LIKE QUESTIONS
BIRTH PAINS AND THE STUPOR OF DEATH
WHY MAN THE TRANSFER OF A HUNDRED MILLIONS OF STOCK WOULD GIVE ME CONTROL OF THE COTTON-MILLS OF AMERICA
I LOVE--SOME ONE ELSE HER HEART BOUNDED AND AGAIN WAS STILL
FINALLY THE JUDGE PLUCKED UP COURAGE
I HAVE HAD A--FULL DAY HE EXPLAINED TO MRS GREY
THEN TOO YOU ARE A CRESSWELL NOW SHE SMILED BITTERLY
THE TELEPHONE RANG
BUT AT YONDER FOUNTAIN THE CLERK WOULD ROUGHLY REFUSE TO SERVE HER
HERE AM I SEND ME ZORA ROSE AND WALKED UP THE AISLE
MISS TAYLOR SAW IT
THE PALE BOY-FACE OF ONE WITH SOFT BROWN EYES GLARED UP SIGHTLESS TO THE SUN
BUT HERE THERE IS NO PEACE
THIS YEAR THEY STARTED HIGH AGAIN
AH MY PEOPLE
HE SAW LONG SNAKES SLITHERING ACROSS HIS PATH AND FEAR-STRUCK BEASTS FLEEING BEFORE HIS COMING
THEN THE FIRM REPLY MRS GREY I THANK YOU BUT I CANNOT ACCEPT YOUR OFFER SARAH SMITH'S VOICE WAS STRONG THE TREMOR HAD LEFT HER HANDS
OH NO THEY ARE TOO SHREWD TO ASK THAT
THAT VERY MORNING MISS WYNN HAD TELEGRAPHED BLES ALWYN
THEN HE PAUSED AGAIN STILL BEYOND ARM'S-LENGTH LOOKING AT HER WITH FEAR-STRUCK EYES
MISS SMITH AND MISS TAYLOR WHO WERE SORTING THE MAIL HEARD THEM SINGING AS THEY CAME UP OUT OF THE SWAMP
THEN THERE WAS THE CHANCE OF GETTING THE SWAMP CLEARED FOR ALMOST NOTHING
I CEASED MY VISITS
SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT INTENDED TO WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE
HE HAD SPOKEN ALMOST HARSHLY TO HER AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST BROOD OR WORK TODAY
SHE TURNED IMPATIENTLY FROM THE WINDOW WITH A FEELING OF LONELINESS
SHE HAD KEPT IT SECRET FROM HIM UNTIL NOW OUT OF PERVERSENESS OUT OF HER LOVE OF MYSTERY AND SECRETS
YOU HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN WHAT YOU WERE WAITING FOR--ISN'T THAT SO SIS HELEN REGARDED HER BROTHER THROUGH HER VEILING LASHES
AND THEN THEY CAME
TODAY SHE WAS STRONGER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SITTING UP LOOKING LISTLESSLY OUT ACROSS THE WORLD--A QUEER WORLD
IF HE WERE THE ONLY ONE IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
AND WITH THIS WENT MENTAL CHANGE
THERE BELOW WAS THE GATHERING OF THE WORLDS
HAVE I GOT A LITTLE OF THE YEAR'S WAGE COMING TO ME OR MORE CARELESSLY AND CRINGINGLY
SHE WROTE TWO LETTERS AND THEN CURLED UP TO HER NOVEL AND CANDY
HAVE YOU MANY SETTLEMENTS SHE INQUIRED
AND THEN LIKE A WAITING STORM THE TORRENT OF HER GRIEF SWEPT DOWN UPON HER
SHE FROZE AND COULD NOT MOVE
SIS I'LL CABLE TO PARIS TODAY
ZORA SAT HIDDEN AND ALONE IN SILENT ECSTASY
MEAN
THEIR STORES WERE CROWDED THEIR SCALES GROANED THEIR GINS SANG
POSSESSED BY THE SPIRIT OF HER VISION SHE WOULD CHANT LOW-VOICED TREMULOUS MISCHIEVOUS
THE SMITH SCHOOL WAS EVIDENTLY A SEVERE THORN IN THE FLESH OF THIS MAN
I HAVE NOW DECIDED TO SEND YOU TO MY HOME IN ALABAMA TO MY FATHER OR YOUR BROTHER
WELL YOU'RE A QUEER ONE
SHE LONGED FOR REST
THEN I TRIED TO GET THE LAND BUT TOLLIVER KEPT PUTTING ME OFF AND FINALLY I LEARNED THAT COLONEL CRESSWELL HAD BOUGHT IT
THE TIME WAS RIPE FOR CHANGE
LAYING ASIDE HER DRESS SHE DRAPED HER SHIMMERING CLOTH ABOUT HER DRAGGING HER HAIR DOWN IN A HEAVY MASS OVER EARS AND NECK UNTIL SHE SEEMED HERSELF A BRIDE
THE FIRST IS THE GIFT OF GOD THE SECOND IS THE VISION OF GENIUS BUT THE THIRD IS THE REWARD OF HONESTY
THE SILVER FLEECE WAS GOLDEN FOR ITS PRICES WERE FLYING ALOFT
MISS SMITH WHO DO YOU THINK HAS BEEN HERE SHE BURST OUT ENTHUSIASTICALLY
THERE WAS NO STEP TO THE PLATFORM HER BAG WAS HEAVY AND THE PORTER WAS BUSY HELPING THE WHITE FOLKS TO ALIGHT
HE HAD ESTIMATED THE CURRENT MARKET PRICES ACCORDING TO THE MONTGOMERY PAPER YET THE PRICES IN TOOMSVILLE WERE FIFTY TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT HIGHER
A WELL-MEANING WOMAN AMBITIOUS BUT CURIOUSLY NARROW
WHEN HE OPENED THEM AGAIN A WHITE FIGURE WAS COMING UP THE AVENUE OF THE OAKS
THE MEETING WAS IN THE BIG ROOM OF ZORA'S HOUSE AND AUNT RACHEL CAME EARLY WITH HER CHEERY VOICE AND SMILE WHICH FADED SO QUICKLY TO LINES OF SORROW AND DESPAIR AND THEN TWINKLED BACK AGAIN
WOULD IT NOT BE WORTH A FIGHT SUGGESTED MRS VANDERPOOL WITH A LITTLE HEIGHTENING OF COLOR IN HER PALE CHEEK
AND A MAN IN ADDITION
CREDIT AND NOT CASH IS THE CURRENCY OF THE BLACK BELT
THERE WILL STILL BE SLAVERY AND OPPRESSION ALL AROUND US
THEN STANDING BESIDE THE FIREPLACE WITH THE WHITE STILL CORPSE BETWEEN HER AND THE DOOR SHE TOOK UP HER AWFUL VIGIL
BUT WHEN HE ENTERED THE DOORS OF HIS LODGING-PLACE AND GATHERING HIS MAIL SLOWLY MOUNTED THE STAIRS THERE CAME THE BATTLE OF HIS LIFE
HIS DEVOTION TO AN IDEAL WHICH SHE THOUGHT SO UTTERLY UNPRACTICAL AROUSED KEEN CURIOSITY AND ADMIRATION
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO ACT DISHONESTLY WOULD YOU HE ASKED
THIS IS STILL ANOTHER AND UNCOVERING HER HAND SHE SHOWED A RING WITH A LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND
HARD PRESSED HE DECIDED AND HURRIED TO THEM
SHE FELT INCLINED TO FLUTTER BUT GRIPPED HERSELF
WASN'T WHAT I SAID TRUE HE HAD ASKED
QUITE WORTH WATCHING AND PERHAPS WORTH GUIDING
IN THE MORNING SHE CAME DOWN EARLY DESPITE SOME DAWDLING OVER HER TOILET
WE MUST GET LAND TO RENT AND ARRANGE SOMEHOW THE MOTHER SOBBED THE CRADLE--WAS BABY'S WITH AN OATH THE WHITE MAN DASHED THE CRADLE INTO THE FIRE AND THE RED FLAME SPURTED ALOFT
FRANKLY THERE IS A STRONG GROUP OF YOUR OLD FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS FORMING AGAINST YOU
SHE DID NOT LOVE THE GIRL BUT SHE WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED IN HER
EACH BAND MISTOOK THE OTHER FOR THE ARMED NEGROES AND THE LEADERS YELLED IN VAIN
DON'T SHAKE HANDS WITH NIGGERS IT WAS RECURRING FLASHES OF TEMPER LIKE THIS TOGETHER WITH EVIDENCES OF DUBIOUS COMPANY AND A GROWING FONDNESS FOR LIQUOR THAT DROVE MARY CRESSWELL MORE AND MORE TO FIND SOLACE IN THE WORK OF CONGRESSMAN TODD'S CIVIC CLUB
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
WE'RE BUYING IT AND IT'S PART PAID FOR ALREADY THE DISCUSSION BECAME GENERAL
HIS HORSE WAS REEKING WITH SWEAT AS HE STAGGERED AGAIN INTO THE SCHOOL-YARD
FROM THE RADIANT GIRL WHOM CRESSWELL HAD MET THREE YEARS EARLIER THE CHANGE WAS STARTLING AND YET THE CONTRAST SEEMED EVEN GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR HER GLORY THEN HAD BEEN HER ABUNDANT AND ALMOST GOLDEN HAIR
I HAVEN'T A SINGLE SPARE WORKER SHE DECLARED
A FEW OF THEM WITH BRAINS WILL HELP US RULE THE REST WITH MONEY
ONE BULLET FLEW HIGH AND SANG THROUGH A LIGHTED WINDOW
SEE HERE HE THUNDERED HANDING THE LAWYER THE NOTICE OF THE INJUNCTION
WHY I'M RATHER--BLACK SHE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE BUT SAID REFLECTIVELY
HE HAD STUCK IT OUT
WHEN ALWYN ACCOMPANIED HER HOME THAT NIGHT MISS WYNN SET HERSELF TO KNOW HIM BETTER FOR SHE SUSPECTED THAT HE MIGHT BE A COMING MAN
HE WHEELED AND LEAPT TOWARD THE DRIPPING SHELTER IN THE TREE
THEN ONE DAY ZORA WHISPERED
HE FELT THE BASKET PAUSE AND HE GLANCED UP
THEY WERE SIMPLY COPYING THE WHITE WORLD
NO HE SAID TO THE COMMITTEE FROM THE NEW MILL-WORKERS UNION
SOFTNESS AND DAINTINESS SILK AND LACE AND GLIMMERING FLESH BELONGED TO WOMEN IN HIS MIND AND HE DESPISED AMAZONS AND BUSINESS WOMEN
MRS CRESSWELL GAVE THEM NO AUTHORITY TO SIGN HER NAME SHE'S BEEN VERY ACTIVE SMITH PERSISTED AND NATURALLY WE WERE ALL ANXIOUS CRESSWELL BIT HIS LIP
YAS'M HIT'S SLAVERY SHE AGREED
THEY ARE GETTING IMPUDENT AROUND HERE
JUST AS THE FINAL CLAUSES OF THE COMBINE AGREEMENT WERE TO BE SIGNED THERE APPEARED A SHORTAGE IN THE COTTON-CROP AND PRICES BEGAN TO SOAR
ZORA SENSED FULLY THE SITUATION
AND I CAME TO TELL YOU SENATOR SMITH THAT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE BACK OF THIS ATTACK UPON THE SCHOOLS ARE NO FRIENDS OF YOURS MISS WYNN EXTRACTED FROM HER RETICULE A TYPEWRITTEN PAPER
THE COLONEL CAME OUT SMILING TOO WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HANDS
YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IN THE COUNTRY WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT TIES THE WELL-BALANCED MISS WYNN FOR A MOMENT LOST HER APLOMB BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT
I SAW YOU ENJOYED THE CONCERT MR ALWYN SHE SAID AND ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES RIPPLED AUDIBLY
A HUMAN EYE IS A WONDERFUL THING WHEN IT SIMPLY WAITS AND WATCHES
MRS GREY THOUGHT THE COOKING-SCHOOL VERY NICE
THE KIND AND GROWTH OF THE TREES
I'M THINKING SHE MURMURED OF BUYING THE SWAMP THIRTY-THREE THE BUYING OF THE SWAMP IT'S A SHAME ASSERTED JOHN TAYLOR WITH SOMETHING LIKE REAL FEELING
AND I DON'T WANT TO BOARD IN--I WANTS TO BE FREE HE LOOKED AT HER CURLED DOWN SO EARNESTLY AT HER PUZZLING TASK AND A PITY FOR THE MORE THAN MOTHERLESS CHILD SWEPT OVER HIM
IT WAS A LARGE TWISTED THING WITH ONE LOW FLYING LIMB THAT CURLED OUT ACROSS ANOTHER TREE AND MADE A MIGHTY SEAT ABOVE THE WATERS
SOMETIMES AND ZORA SOMETIMES YOU STEAL--YOU STOLE THE PIN FROM MISS TAYLOR AND WE STOLE MR CRESSWELL'S MULE FOR TWO DAYS YES SHE SAID FAINTLY WITH A PERPLEXED WRINKLE IN HER BROWS I STOLE IT WELL ZORA I DON'T WANT YOU EVER TO TELL ANOTHER LIE OR EVER TO TAKE ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU SHE LOOKED AT HIM SILENTLY WITH THE SHADOW OF SOMETHING LIKE TERROR FAR BACK IN THE DEPTHS OF HER DEEP EYES
HE FELT LIKE STOPPING THESE PEOPLE AND CRYING
ZORA HAD A SMALL LOG HOSPITAL ERECTED WITH FOUR WHITE BEDS A PRIVATE ROOM AND AN OFFICE WHICH WAS ALSO EMMA'S BEDROOM
IN THAT TIME WHAT HAD HAPPENED
OF COURSE YOU ARE HE WHISPERED TENDERLY HIDING HER LITTLE HANDS IN HIS
ZORA HE SAID WE'LL MAKE IT THE FINEST BALE EVER RAISED IN TOOMS
GOOD-EVENING HONEY
DEFTLY TWISTING AND INTERTWINING THE BRANCHES OF TREE AND BUSH HE WOVE A CANOPY OF LIVING GREEN THAT SHADOWED THE CURIOUS NEST AND WARDED IT SNUGLY FROM WIND AND WATER
THE HORSES FLEW BY THEIR HOOF-BEATS DYING IN THE DISTANCE
IT WAS--IT COULDN'T BE--SURELY IT WAS MR HARRY CRESSWELL RIDING THROUGH THE GATEWAY ON HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE MARE
HE LAUGHED AT IT AND INDIGNANTLY DENIED IT
HERE TOO WAS WORK--A STRANGE STRONG SOUL CRUELLY STRICKEN IN HER YOUTH
I DID NOT THINK YOU WERE INTERESTED DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THIS CHILD LABOR BUSINESS WAS OPPOSED TO MY INTERESTS DEAR I DID NOT DREAM IT
THE OTHER TOWNS WERE REPLICAS OF TOOMSVILLE
JOHN TAYLOR REMOVED HIS COAT LIGHTED A BLACK CIGAR AND ELEVATED HIS HEELS
SHE STARTED UP
IF IT FAILED WOULD NOT THEY FAIL
WHY HAD SHE NOT BOUND HIM TO HER
THEN THE MASS DIVIDED INTO TWO WINGS AND SLOWLY ENCIRCLED THE FENCE OF FIRE
WHY I DON'T KNOW,"--THE ANSWER WAS DELIBERATE
EVIDENTLY SOMETHING ABOUT HIS STANDARDS WAS WRONG
THEY HAD STOLEN THE SILVER FLEECE
WITH MONEY AND LEISURE MRS STILLINGS HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN NEW YORK AND BOSTON THE TRAINING SHE HAD BEEN DENIED IN WASHINGTON ON ACCOUNT OF HER COLOR
THE PRECEPTRESS OF THE STRUGGLING SCHOOL FOR NEGRO CHILDREN MERELY EVINCED PATIENCE FOR THE YOUNGER WOMAN'S FERVENCY
AND IF IT WERE
THE BOYS IS PLUMB MAD BUT I'SE A-PLEADIN WITH EM NOT TO DO NOTHIN RASH BUT--BUT I THOUGHT THEY HAD ALREADY STARTED TO WORK A CROP ON THE TOLLIVER PLACE YES'M DEY HAD
THE PASTIME COST HIM FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MISS TAYLOR WAS PERPLEXED BUT EAGER
ZORA SHE HAD TO CALL TWICE FOR ZORA WITH WIDENED EYES WAS READING THE WASHINGTON POST
IT WAS FOOLISH FROM THE FIRST--THAT BLACK COUNTRY GENTLY MISS WYNN CHECKED HIM
MY POOR LITTLE PEOPLE
HAVE YOU SEEN THE EASTERLYS THE LADIES LEFT THEIR CARDS--THEY ARE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
MISS MARY SUDDENLY SAT UP THREW A HASTY GLANCE INTO THE GLASS AND FELT THE BACK OF HER BELT
AND SINGING AND CHANTING THE THRONG POURED OUT UPON THE BLACK HIGHWAY WAVING THEIR TORCHES
SEE THE WASHER-WOMAN IN RED HE WHISPERED
HER BROTHER CAME OUT OF THE OFFICE NODDED CASUALLY FOR THEY HAD LITTLE INTERCOURSE THESE DAYS AND RODE AWAY
FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL OTHER MEETINGS FIVE MEN TOOK COURAGE--THREE OF THE BEST AND TWO OF THE WEAKEST
FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE FELL UPON THEIR KNEES WHEN THE HUGE BLACK PREACHER UNCOATED RED-EYED FRENZIED STRETCHED HIS LONG ARMS TO HEAVEN
I'VE STAYED OUT ALL ALONE HEAPS O NIGHTS HE LOOKED AT HER WITH A CURIOUS AWE
WON'T YOU TAKE A STAND ON SOME OF THESE PROGRESSIVE MATTERS--THIS BILL OR THE CHILD LABOR MOVEMENT OR LOW TARIFF LEGISLATION MR SMITH LISTENED BUT SHOOK HIS HEAD
MISS WYNN THOUGHT HIM DELIGHTFULLY BASHFUL
NOW SHE FEARED THE COLONEL WAS SUSPICIOUS AND HER HEART SANK
THE HOUSE WAS A WHITE OBLONG BUILDING OF TWO STORIES
HE HAD PAPERS POSTERS PROGRAMMES AND LETTERS
JUST AS ONE MUST ASSOCIATE WITH ONE'S MAIDS AND CHAUFFEURS AND DRESSMAKERS--CORDIALLY AND KINDLY BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE BUT--BUT DEAR MRS VANDERPOOL YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR CHILDREN TRAINED THAT WAY WOULD YOU CERTAINLY NOT MY DEAR
SHE ROSE BEFORE THEM LIKE A SPECTRAL VENGEANCE
A SMALL CABIN ON THE TOWN'S RAGGED FRINGE WAS CROWDED TO SUFFOCATION
HE TRIED TO SHAKE OFF THIS FEELING BUT IT CLUNG AND AT LAST IN SHEER DESPERATION HE PROMISED TO GO OUT OF A NIGHT WITH A FELLOW CLERK WHO RATHER BOASTED OF THE PEOPLE HE KNEW
THE IDLERS BLACK AND WHITE CLUSTERED ROUND GAZING AT IT AND FINGERING IT WITH REPEATED EXCLAMATIONS OF ASTONISHMENT
ELEVEN THE FLOWERING OF THE FLEECE ZORA OBSERVED MISS SMITH IT'S A GREAT BLESSING NOT TO NEED SPECTACLES ISN'T IT ZORA THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
MR
MR
AND OH MISS SMITH
MRS CRESSWELL TURNED AND RECOGNIZED HIM WITH GENUINE PLEASURE
THE PREACHER PAUSED A MOMENT THEN STARTED BOLDLY FORWARD WITH UPRAISED HANDS
HE'S A FAKIR MAYBE SAID ZORA SERENELY AND QUIETLY
I KNOW IT DOES
THEY ARE VERY HUMAN THESE MEN ESPECIALLY THE LABORERS
HE THREW UP HIS HANDS IN THE OLD WAY AND HALLOOED
HIS CANE SLIPPED ALONG THE IRON BANDS SUDDENLY AND THE OLD MAN LURCHING FORWARD CLUTCHED IN SPACE TO SAVE HIMSELF AND TOUCHED A HUMAN HAND
IT'S AT YOUR HOME WHERE MY SISTER MARY TAUGHT GREAT SCOTT
WAS IT NOT THE KING'S HIGHWAY
HERE WAS A PLACE HOWEVER FOR SPEECH AND HE SPOKE ALMOST ROUGHLY
NO VOWS WERE GIVEN NONE ASKED FOR
THE CHILD LABOR BILL MUST EITHER GO THROUGH UNAMENDED OR BE KILLED
THE CROWD INCREASED UNTIL THE WONDERFUL SPELL OF THOSE DARK AND UPTURNED FACES PULSED IN HER BLOOD
THE ROUGH GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS SILENTLY PUT ASIDE
THE IDEA OF A WOMAN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND ARGUE ABOUT THINGS MEN KNEW
BUT HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING IN TONES ALMOST CONFIDENTIAL
I CAN'T COME JUST NOW--BUT PRETTY SOON WHY
SHE PUSHED THEM SLOWLY ON AND TURNED ASIDE TO LET THE ANGER THE IMPOTENT FUTILE ANGER RAGE ITSELF OUT
YOU CAN'T NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHERE IS IT
TO TELL IT WELL TO TELL IT BEAUTIFULLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH
IT WAS EMMA BERTIE'S CHILD
THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY LEFT HIM AS THE VISION OF CARRIE WYNN HAD LEFT HIM ALONE A MERE CLERK AN INSIGNIFICANT COG IN THE GREAT GRINDING WHEEL OF HUMDRUM DRUDGERY
THEY'RE DEAD OPPOSITE MUTUALLY CONTRADICTORY ABSOLUTELY TAYLOR CHECKED HIM
WITH A START OF FEAR MRS CRESSWELL RUSHED OUT INTO THE HALL AND CLOSED THE DOOR
MRS VANDERPOOL GAVE HER A LONG SEARCHING LOOK
ONLY SHE HOPED THE COMMUNION WOULD BE ON TASTES NEARER HERS THAN THOSE HE SOMETIMES MANIFESTED
HAD HE SEEN A HAUNT
HE KNEW HIM ONLY AS A RICH PHILANTHROPIST WHO HAD HELPED THE NEIGHBORHOOD GUILD IN WASHINGTON--ONE OF TODD'S HOBBIES
HE HAD HATED TO OBTRUDE HIS TROUBLES ON MRS CRESSWELL WHO SEEMED SO TORN IN SOUL
BUT GIVE IT UP CARRIE
DO YOU THINK--BY GOD SIR!--THAT I'D BETRAY SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN TO BUT HARRY'S HAND AND IMPASSIVE MANNER RESTRAINED HIM
BUT A WHITE MAN IN THE CONDUCTOR'S SEAT WHISPERED SOMETHING AND THE ROW SUDDENLY STOPPED
AND SOMEHOW SHE AND ZORA WOULD FIND A WAY
WHEN SCHOOL-TIME CAME THERE WAS NOT YET MONEY ENOUGH FOR COTTON-PICKING WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED
THEN TOO SHE LIKED THE HOUSE AND ITS APPOINTMENTS
IT WAS A DESOLATE BIT OF THE CRESSWELL MANOR A TINY CABIN NEW-BOARDED AND BARE IN FRONT OF IT A BLAZING BONFIRE
MASTER WHAT HAVE I EARNED
BUT THESE ARE NOT MY CHILDREN THEY ARE THE CHILDREN OF NEGROES
SHE WAS THE SORT OF WOMAN SHE HERSELF MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF SHE HAD NOT MARRIED
WHEN THE TIME COMES HE ANNOUNCED DELIBERATELY I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ON SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS
HE WAS A YOUNG LIGHT-BROWN BOY HIS MANNER OBSEQUIOUS
AS IF ANY ONE OF US WERE WORTH A LIFE
THE LANDLORDS ON THE CONTRARY WERE LOSING POWER AND PRESTIGE AND THEIR FARM LABOR DESPITE STRENUOUS EFFORTS WAS DRIFTING TO TOWN ATTRACTED BY NEW AND INCIDENTAL WORK AND HIGHER WAGES
ALREADY A CERTAIN WARMTH AND GLOW HAD STOLEN INTO THE AIR AND THE SWAMP WAS CALLING ITS CHILD WITH LOW SEDUCTIVE VOICE
SOMEHOW HE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THE WORLD AS LONELY BEFORE
YET SHE FOUND HERSELF BENDING EVERY ENERGY TO PULL THIS MAN DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF TIME-SERVERS AND EVEN AS SHE FAILED FEELING SOMETHING LIKE CONTEMPT FOR HIS STUBBORNNESS
BUT SHE MEANT IT FIERCELY
AS A RESULT THERE CAME TO THE EXHIBIT A LITTLE GROUP CALLED THE OUTCASTS WHICH WAS REALLY A MASTERLY THING AND SENT THE DIRECTOR SIGNOR ALBERNI INTO HYSTERICAL COMMENDATION
COLONEL CRESSWELL SAT IN HIS CHAIR ON THE PORCH ALONE
DIDN'T YOU SEE HER WHILE SHE WAS HERE
LEAGUE BEATS TRUST
SHE SAW THE LONG GNARLED FINGERS OF THE TOUGH LITTLE TREES AND THEY LOOKED LIKE THE FINGERS OF ELSPETH DOWN THERE BENEATH THE EARTH PULLING AGAINST THE BOY
THEY WERE VERY NEAR EACH OTHER DURING THESE DAYS AND YET THERE WAS EVER SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM
IS THAT SO CRIED MRS GREY JOYFULLY
BEFORE HER STOOD THIS TALL BLACK GIRL QUIETLY RETURNING HER LOOK
MILLIE'S BEEN SICK SINCE THE LAST BABY DIED AND I HAD TO NEGLECT MY CROP TO TEND HER AND THE OTHER LITTLE ONES--I DIDN'T MAKE MUCH
BUT I'M GOING TO WORK FOR IT WHO'S GWINE BEGAN SIMPSON BUT STOPPED HELPLESSLY
SLOWLY AND THICKLY HE SPOKE WORKING HIS TREMBLING HANDS
THE ENDLESS GOING AND COMING OF MEN
NEW POINT OF VIEW TO ME
GENTLEMAN IS ASKING IF YOU FORGITS IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT SIR SAID SAM
SHE HAD LEARNED FROM SENATOR SMITH THAT THE LADY TOOK SPECIAL INTEREST IN ALWYN
CRESSWELL STRODE UP
TREAT ALWYN WELL AND CALL ON MISS WYNN AS USUAL--SEE IT'S A HARD PILL--BUT ALL RIGHT LEAVE THE REST TO ME
WHERE DID YOU GET IT HE ASKED
NOT THAT MARY TAYLOR DID NOT BELIEVE IN MISS SMITH'S WORK SHE WAS TOO HONEST NOT TO BELIEVE IN EDUCATION
BUT SHE TURNED QUICKLY AWAY
THIS IS AN AUSPICIOUS DAY
THERE WERE THOUGHTS AND VAGUE STIRRINGS OF UNREST IN THIS MASS OF BLACK FOLK
NOT THAT SHE WOULD COME TO IT VACANT-MINDED BUT RATHER AS A TRAINED WOMAN STARVED FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND WANTING SOMETHING OF THE BEAUTY AND EASE OF LIFE
GOD COULD NOT BE SO CRUEL
THIS IS BETTER
WHAT SCHOOL OLD MISS SCHOOL MISS SMITH'S SCHOOL YES THE TONE WAS DISDAINFUL
DID YOU EVER COME CRESSWELL INVITED
THE PRESIDENT WAS A BROWN WOMAN WHO SPOKE EASILY AND WELL AND INTRODUCED THE MAIN SPEAKER
TO CRESSWELL A MAN WHO HAD CHEATED THE WHOLE SOUTH OUT OF MILLIONS BY A SERIES OF MISREPRESENTATIONS OUGHT TO REGARD THIS LITTLE FALSEHOOD AS NOTHING
DO YOU DANCE AND LAUGH AND HEAR AND SEE NOT
BUT I WAS SO HURRIED IN LEAVING THAT I DIDN'T LOOK CAREFULLY AND THE WILD THOUGHT SURGED IN HER SUPPOSE IT WAS MORE
NO'M AND WE AIN'T GWINE TO MOVE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL ARRANGED IT WAS GLOOMILY BUT DE OLE CUNNEL HE WON'T LET US GO THE LISTENER WAS INSTANTLY SYMPATHETIC
I'VE BEEN FEARING IT
THE VOICES OF THE HANDS AND HOSTLERS GREW FAINTER AND THINNER IN THE DISTANCE OF PURPLE TWILIGHT UNTIL THE LAST OF THEM DISAPPEARED
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY PENETRATION SHE CRIED
DON'T THEY EVER GET THERE FEW ARRIVE SAID MRS VANDERPOOL
HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE HANDWRITING
SHE ASKED IF $500,000 WOULD DO IT
IT IS TOO SOCIALISTIC
POOR CHILD SHE GASPED AS SHE SAW THE BOY FLYING IN WILD TERROR OVER THE FIELDS WITH HUE AND CRY BEHIND HIM
HAD HE DREAMED
ADD TO THIS A MAN BRED TO BE AGREEABLE AND OUTDOING HIS TRAINING AND A PRETTY GIRL GAY WITH NEW-FOUND COMPANIONSHIP--ALL THIS IS APT TO MAKE A MORNING WORTH REMEMBERING
THEY BELIEVE IN EDUCATION ALL RIGHT BUT THEY AIN'T IN FOR TRAINING LAWYERS AND PROFESSORS JUST YET
THEY WERE RATHER THE ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH ALL THINGS OCCURRED AND WERE FELT AND JUDGED
COULD IT BE THAT THIS NEGRO HAD DARED TO MISUNDERSTAND HER--HAD PRESUMED
BUT IT BROUGHT MARY TAYLOR BACK TO A SENSE OF THINGS AND UNDER A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE SPOKE
YOUR SUCCESS LAST YEAR MADE YOU INDISPENSABLE TO OUR PLANS OUR SUCCESS LAUGHED COLONEL CRESSWELL RUEFULLY THINKING OF THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LOST AND THE MORTGAGE TO COVER IT
TAYLOR LOOKED PUZZLED
THEN WE MUST ESCAPE HER HE SAID GAYLY
IT WAS INTERESTING
I--I WILL COME--IN A MOMENT AND MRS CRESSWELL HURRIED OUT
WHAT WOULD ELSPETH DO
AND MISS WYNN ADDED A TOUCH OF SPICE BY SEVERAL PERTINENT QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS
IT WAS A FEARFUL PLACE IN THE RAIN
OUR STOCK OF CHAIRS IS LIMITED IT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE A CASUAL MEETING RECEIVE THIS SOCIAL STAMP
HERE NOW WAS NO PROTECTION
IT WAS SIMPLY IGNORANT PRESUMPTION AND SHE MUST CORRECT HIM FIRMLY BUT GENTLY LIKE A CHILD
BUT FRANKLY THE DECIDING FACTOR WAS THE DEMAND OF THE SOUTH IS THERE ANYTHING IN WASHINGTON THAT THE SOUTH DOES NOT ALREADY OWN SENATOR SMITH SMILED THINLY
YON WAY'S NICEST SHE SAID
TO JOHN TAYLOR MRS GREY'S DISPOSAL OF THE INCOME WAS UNBELIEVABLE BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE MEMORY OF A MIGHTY MAN
THEN HE CAME BACK AND SEATING HIMSELF CLOSE TO TEERSWELL PUSHED ASIDE THE WHISKEY
THAT'S ALL AND SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN DESPAIRINGLY AND STARED AT THE DULL SWAMP
WHAT HAD SHE SAID AND HINTED TO MARY
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
INDEED THEY HAVE SO ENGINEERED IT THAT THE PARTY CHIEFS EXPECT FROM YOU A DEFENCE OF THEIR DROPPING OF THE EDUCATIONAL BILL WHAT YES AND PROBABLY YOUR NOMINATION WILL COME BEFORE THE SPEECH AND CONFIRMATION AFTER BLES WALKED THE FLOOR EXCITEDLY FOR A WHILE AND THEN SAT DOWN AND SMILED
HE HAD NO IDEA HOWEVER THAT SHE MEANT TO ENDOW THE SCHOOL OR ENTERTAINED WHOLESALE PLANS FOR NEGRO EDUCATION
THE COLD SWEAT OOZED ON HIS FACE
MISS TAYLOR WAS VERY TIRESOME AND WAS FOREVER DOING AND SAYING SILLY THINGS
SHE DID NOT WINCE NOR CRY OUT
BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN SHE DIMLY SAW A COUPLE SAUNTERING ALONG THE ROAD BUT SHE HARDLY NOTICED THEIR WHITE FACES UNTIL THE LITTLE VOICE OF THE GIRL RAISED TIMIDLY GREETED HER
WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE BASEMENT OF THE GREAT CHURCH WAS FILLING WITH A THRONG OF MEN AND WOMEN
WE'VE NOT HEARD THE LAST OF THIS BUT ROB TOSSED HIS HEAD BELLIGERENTLY
MUST SHE LIVE
NOW HE MUST GET RID OF HIS COMPANY--BEFORE ZORA RETURNED
SHE SAW AGAIN THE GNARLED AND BLACK AND CLAW-LIKE FINGERS OF ELSPETH GRIPPING AND DRAGGING HER DOWN
BUT GOD IN HEAVEN HELP YOU IF YOU DO FINISHED MISS SMITH CALMLY
IF HE GETS THE APPOINTMENT HE'LL LET THE BILL DROP I SEE--EVERYBODY IS RAISING HIS PRICE IS HE
COME HONEY HE SHOUTED YOU'SE A'DREAMING
HE DID NOT SEE HER IN THESE SEVEN DAYS
I--I WAS SO AFRAID--SOMETIMES--THAT I WASN'T SHE WHISPERED LIFTING UP TO HIM HER EYES STREAMING WITH TEARS
BUT MRS VANDERPOOL SHE PROTESTED IS IT RIGHT
HARRY CRESSWELL 66 NINE
I'SE HUNGRY SO'M I ANSWERED THE BOY FUMBLING AT HIS BUNDLE
HER WHOLE BODY GREW TENSE ALERT
INTO THE FIRE SHE THRUST PINE-KNOTS
I'VE BEEN WAITING I'M SORRY--BUT I'VE BEEN--CONVERTED AND SHE TOLD HER STORY
INDEED YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN MY LAST THOUGHT--YOU SEEM TO ME--I SPEAK PLAINLY--A WORLDLY WOMAN
THE SUN BURNED FIERCELY UPON THE YOUNG COTTON PLANTS AS THE SPRING HASTENED AND THEY LIFTED THEIR HEADS IN DARKER WILDER LUXURIANCE
SHE EYED HIM CRITICALLY
WHY NO SHE ANSWERED LYING INSTINCTIVELY BEFORE SHE QUITE REALIZED WHAT HER LIE MEANT
WELL I RECKON YOU'D BE A-FEARED IF YOU WAS CAUGHT OUT IN THE BLACK DARK ALL ALONE POOH SHE SCOFFED AND HUGGED HER KNEES
AT FIRST SHE POUNCED UPON HIM IN MIRTHFUL ALMOST IMPISH GLEE TEASING AND MOCKING AND HALF SCARING HIM DESPITE HIS FIFTEEN YEARS OF YOUNG MANHOOD
SHE HEARD A BIRD SINGING FAR DOWN IN THE SWAMP
SHE FELT THE ATMOSPHERE THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED
YOU WON'T AFFIRMED BLES
AND AGAIN AS THE DOCTOR CHEERILY TURNED TO GO SHE SOUGHT TO REPEAT THE OLD QUESTION
WOULD THE BOYS HELP HER SOME TIME TO CLEAR SOME SWAMP LAND
IT ISN'T THE BOODLE CROWD THAT'S HOLLERING BUT A NEW SET AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
MILL IS JUST STARTED AND NOT YET PAYING EXPENSES
INVOLUNTARILY ZORA'S HAND CREPT OUT PROTECTINGLY AND LAY A MOMENT OVER THE WHITE JEWELLED FINGERS
THIS IS BUT A LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD AND YET MANY PEOPLE PASS HERE IN THIRTY YEARS
YOU HAVE BLUNDERED INTO THIS LIFE WORK OF MINE AND WELL NIGH RUINED IT
SLOWLY WONDERFULLY FOR THEM HEAVEN BENT IN THESE DYING DAYS OF THE YEAR AND KISSED THE EARTH AND THE TREMOR THRILLED ALL LANDS AND SEAS
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT HE CONFESSED AFTER A WHILE
LOVE AND SERVE THEM
COME LET'S BE HONEST AND POOR--AND FREE SHE REGARDED HIM A MOMENT SEARCHINGLY THEN A LOOK HALF QUIZZICAL HALF SORROWFUL CAME INTO HER EYES
MATTERS SIMMERED ON IN THIS WAY AND THE ONLY PARTY WHOLLY SATISFIED WITH CONDITIONS WAS JOHN TAYLOR AND THE FEW YOUNG SOUTHERNERS WHO SAW THROUGH HIS EYES
BUT HE OBJECTED THAT THERE WAS THE REGULAR COLLECTION AND TWO OR THREE OTHER COLLECTIONS A BAPTISM A MEETING OF THE TRUSTEES
THE DAMNED SOUTHERN UPSTART GROWLED TEERSWELL FORGETTING STILLINGS BIRTH-PLACE
HER BROWN HAIR WAS ALMOST GOLDEN
MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE SHE HAD BEEN NOT A LITTLE DISMAYED BY THE OUTLOOK AND HAD PROTESTED AGAINST HIS BLUNT INSISTENCE
SHE BENT ABOVE THE VERDANT TENDERNESS AND KISSED IT
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO DIE SHE SAID NOTHING
THE GUEST THEMSELVES DID NOT NOTICE THIS
AN ODD FANCY CAME TO HIM
BESIDES THEY HELD EACH CERTAIN PROMISES OF SOCIAL PRESTIGE
IT WASN'T EVEN ONE AGAINST MANY ELSE HOW WILLINGLY SWINGING HIS AXE WOULD HAVE STOOD HIS GROUND BEFORE A MOB
SHE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED EVEN IN GUESSING THE SOURCE OF MRS VANDERPOOL'S INTEREST IN ALWYN AND WITHOUT THAT HER APPEAL WAS BUT BLIND GROPING
I MIGHT WANT TO EDUCATE SOME GIRLS BUT NOT GIRLS LIKE ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL GLANCED AT MR CRESSWELL SMILING TO HERSELF
MRS VANDERPOOL MEANTIME RODE THOUGHTFULLY OUT OF TOWN TOWARD CRESSWELL OAKS
THERE WAS NO DREAM OF FORGIVENESS OF PURIFICATION OF RE-KINDLED LOVE
SHE HEARD NEITHER THE DRONE OF THE SPELLERS NOR DID SHE HEAR MISS TAYLOR SAY ZORA SHE HEARD AND SAW NONE OF THIS
SHE THOUGHT OF THE FLITTING GHOSTS THAT AWFUL NIGHT IN WASHINGTON
WHY SHOULD WE WHO HAVE SACRIFICE THE SUBSTANCE FOR THE SHADOW YOU SEE THE JUDGE HAS GOT THE SUBSTANCE LAUGHED TEERSWELL
I KNOW--I HAVE SINNED AGAINST THE LIGHT AND THE BLOOD OF YOUR POOR BLACK PEOPLE IS RED ON THESE OLD HANDS
THEN I GAVE JOHN TAYLOR--YOU NEEDN'T LOOK
THE LUST OF FINANCIAL DOMINION HAD GRIPPED HIS SOUL AND HE HAD A VISION OF A VAST TRUST OF COTTON MANUFACTURING COVERING THE LAND
I THINK THOUGH I'D TRY IT IF--IF I COULD BE SURE YOU'D TREAT ME FAIRLY AND THAT I'D GET THE LAND IF I PAID FOR IT COLONEL CRESSWELL REDDENED A LITTLE AND JOHN TAYLOR LOOKED AWAY
EVIDENTLY THE WOMAN BELIEVED SHE HAD NO CASE AND WAS WEAKENING
IT WAS TOO FAR FOR WORDS BUT THE SCENE LAY STRANGELY CLEAR AND SHARP-CUT IN THE GREEN MYSTERY OF THE SUNLIGHT
EXACTLY TAYLOR BLANDLY ADMITTED
THE RED WATERS OF THE SWAMP GREW SINISTER AND SULLEN
IMITATION OF COURSE AND SO HE RATTLED ON NOTING NOT THE SILENCE OF THE OTHERS
BLES RUSHED TO THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP AND STOOD THERE IRRESOLUTE
BUT STILL SHE STROVE UNTIL HE WAS CONTENT AND LAUGHING
TWICE SHE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT CHOOSE
SHE WOULD TELL HARRY TO ASK HIM--SHE DID NOT OFTEN SEE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE MUST ASK HIM NOW AND SHE AROSE UNSTEADILY AND SWAYED NOISELESSLY ACROSS THE FLOOR
A WEEK AFTER THE FUNERAL OF COLONEL CRESSWELL JOHN TAYLOR DROVE OUT TO THE SCHOOL AND WAS CLOSETED WITH MISS SMITH
A WOMAN STOOD THERE WHO SHRANK AND COWERED AS IF USED TO BLOWS
ZORA'S EYELIDS DROOPED HER UPPER LIP QUIVERED
HE COMPOSES HIMSELF LOOKS DEATH IN THE EYE AND SPEAKS SOFTLY ON THE CHANCE
DREAMS HE LOOKED AT HER PUZZLED
THIN TO EMANCIPATION
ZORA MURMURED AN INDISTINCT RESPONSE
BUT MY ADVICE TO YOU IS--FINISH YOUR EDUCATION DEVELOP YOUR TALENTS AND THEN COME TO YOUR LIFE WORK A FULL-FLEDGED MAN AND NOT A HALF-IGNORANT BOY I'LL THINK OF IT RETURNED THE BOY SOBERLY
NO MISS SMITH VENTURED
MORE THAN THAT I HAVE NOW A WEALTHY FRIEND
IF JUDGE HAYNES IS REAPPOINTED TO THE SCHOOL-BOARD I SHALL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO TEACH IN THE M STREET HIGH SCHOOL SHE SAID SLOWLY
AMONG OTHERS WAS ONE RELATING TO CHILD LABOR ANOTHER THAT WOULD EFFECT CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE TARIFF AND A PROPOSED LAW PROVIDING FOR A COTTON BALE OF A SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE CUSTOMARY--THE LAST CONSTITUTING A PARTICULARLY CLEVER ARTIFICE WHICH UNDER THE GUISE OF CONVENIENCE IN HANDLING WOULD NECESSITATE THE INSTALLATION OF ENTIRELY NEW GIN AND COMPRESS MACHINERY TO BE SUPPLIED OF COURSE BY THE TRUST
SLOWLY ELSPETH WITH QUIVERING HANDS UNWOUND THE BLACK AND SNAKE-LIKE OBJECT THAT ALWAYS GUARDED HER BREAST
BACK TO A SIMPLER PRIMAL DAY WHEN SHE HERSELF WHITE FRAIL AND FETTERED STOOD BEFORE THE DUSKY MAGNIFICENCE OF SOME BEJEWELLED BARBARIAN QUEEN AND SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY HERSELF
THEY WOULD NEVER BE AS NEAR AS ONCE THEY HAD BEEN FOR HE HAD STEPPED INTO THE WORLD
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS A WELLS OF BOSTON AND ENDURED LAKE GEORGE NOW AND THEN DURING THE SUMMER FOR HER HUSBAND'S SAKE ALTHOUGH SHE REGARDED IT ALL AS RATHER A JOKE
ALREADY THE MINISTER HAD SPIED HER TALL FORM AND FEARED HER POWER
SHE PUT BOTH HER HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID AS SHE KISSED HIS LIPS
WHEN ALL WAS OVER THE AUDIENCE ROSE LEISURELY AND STOOD IN LITTLE KNOTS AND EDDIES LAUGHING AND TALKING
I SEE--THEY ARE NOT PARTIAL TO US THERE BLES WAS GLAD TO HEAR HER SAY US SHE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE
HEREIN LAY ALL HER EARLY WILDNESS AND STRANGENESS
THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND LAUGHED AND JOKED AND IF THEY DID NOT SMOKE THEY CARRIED THEIR LIGHTED CIGARS
A PARTING OF WAYS 293 THIRTY-TWO
SHE FELT NO ANGER SHE SIMPLY WONDERED WHAT HE FEARED
THE GENTLEMAN SPOKE OF SENATOR SMITH AND BLAMED AND RIDICULED HIM
WHY YOU'VE FOUND SOME THINGS WORTH KNOWING IN THIS WORLD HAVEN'T YOU ZORA YES SHE ADMITTED
DURING THE AFTERNOON SHE SENT TO TOWN FOR OIL-CLOTH AND BADE THE BLACK CARPENTER AT MISS SMITH'S MAKE A CEDAR BOX TIGHT AND TARRED
IN TIME ZORA CAME TO STAY OFTEN AT MISS SMITH'S COTTAGE AND TO LEARN NEW AND UNKNOWN WAYS OF LIVING AND DRESSING
AND THE CAT AND OLD BILLY--AH BUT THE WORLD WAS A LONELY THING SO WIDE AND TALL AND EMPTY
FARMING DON'T SEEM TO BE YOUR SPECIALTY THE WORD WAS OFTEN ON MISS TAYLOR'S LIPS AND SHE RECOGNIZED IT
YET HERE WAS THIS RATHER UNUSUAL YOUNG WOMAN ASKING MRS VANDERPOOL TO USE HER INFLUENCE IN MAKING ALWYN BOW TO THE YOKE
HOW IS SHE AND WHERE ZORA MURMURED SOME ANSWER
I HAVE FIGURED OUT ABOUT WHAT THESE THINGS WILL COST
THEN THE TABLE SWAYED GENTLY TO AND FRO
LONG LOW SPACIOUS OVERHUNG WITH OAK AND PINE
WELL DAUGHTER IF THIS CROP SELLS AT TWELVE CENTS I'LL BE ON MY FEET AGAIN AND I WON'T HAVE TO SELL THAT LAND TO THE NIGGER SCHOOL AFTER ALL
BUT NOW SUDDENLY SHE LEAPT TO HER FEET
SLOWER SUBTLER BUT MORE STRIKING WAS THE CHANGE IN ZORA AS SHE BEGAN TO EARN BITS OF PIN MONEY IN THE OFFICE AND TO LEARN TO SEW
HER HAND CLOSED ALMOST CARESSINGLY ON A RUSTY POKER LYING ON THE STOVE NEARBY
SHE LEERED AT THEM
SHE APPEALED TO THEM
EMMA IS A GOOD GIRL
CRESSWELL INTERRUPTED BEFORE HE WAS HALF THROUGH
THERE WERE SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS BUT THE KNOT OF SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN ABOUT MRS CRESSWELL DECLARED EMPHATICALLY THAT IT MUST BE A SOUTHERNER
SHE TALKED OF COOPERATION AND REFUGES AND OTHER EFFORTS
SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LESS ORNAMENTAL POSITION THAN THE AMBASSADORSHIP BUT THERE WERE NO OTHER OPENINGS
H'M--WELL THEN AND JOHN TAYLOR WENT INTO A BROWN STUDY WHILE CRESSWELL PUFFED IMPATIENTLY AT A CIGARETTE
WELL WHAT IS IT OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT ASKED TO SIT BUT SHE STOOD WITH HER HANDS CLASPED LOOSELY BEFORE HER AND HER EYES HALF VEILED
MISS SMITH I WANTS A PENNY PENCIL MISS SMITH IS YO GOT A SPELLER FO TEN CENTS MISS SMITH MAMMY SAY PLEASE LEMME COME TO SCHOOL THIS WEEK AND SHE'LL SHO PAY SATA'DAY YET THE LITTLE VOICES THAT SUMMONED HER BACK TO EARTH WERE LESS CLAMOROUS THAN IN OTHER YEARS FOR THE SCHOOL WAS FAR FROM FULL AND MISS SMITH OBSERVED THE FALLING OFF WITH GRAVE EYES
I PROMISED THE BOY GO ON GO ON--WHY MR TAYLOR AND THE LITTLE BOY BURST INTO TEARS WHILE HE WAS HURRIED OUT
ATLANTA
GIVE HER A COUPLE OF DOLLARS--NOT A CENT MORE JIM SYKES SAY HARRY HOW ABOUT THAT DARKY SYKES CALLED OUT THE COLONEL
DON'T YOU LOVE TO BE FRANK AND OPEN SHE NARROWED HER EYELIDS
THEN SHE HESITATED
LARGE AND LARGER CROWDS GREETED HIM UNTIL HE WAS THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN A HALF DOZEN GREAT NEGRO MASS-MEETINGS IN THE CHIEF CITIES OF THE COUNTRY CULMINATING IN NEW YORK THE NIGHT BEFORE ELECTION
SHE LOOKED HIM OVER AT LEISURE AND SIGHED AT HIS TIE
THE BOY WHEELED BLINDLY AND FLED IN TERROR STUMBLING THROUGH THE SWAMP HEARING STRANGE SOUNDS AND FEELING STEALTHY CREEPING HANDS AND ARMS AND WHISPERING VOICES
SHE HAD BEEN TALKING--JUST TALKING
NOT YET HERE MISS WYNN INTERPOSED
THEY WERE HER HOPE AND SHE WORSHIPPED THEM
BLACK MEN AND MULES HAD STAGGERED BENEATH ITS BURDEN WHILE DEEP SONGS WELLED IN THE HEARTS OF MEN
SHE SEEMED TO FEEL RATHER THAN HEAR HIS PRESENCE AND SHE INQUIRED SOFTLY
I DON'T CARE RETURNED MADAME
THEN HE ROSE
NEVERTHELESS MISS SMITH LED HER TO THE ROOM
THEN EVEN AS SHE PARTIALLY AWOKE SHE LAY STILL WITH CLOSED EYES FEELING THE SHADOW OF SOME GREAT BURDEN YET DARING NOT TO ROUSE HERSELF AND RECALL ITS EXACT FORM
THEY GREETED MISS SMITH CORDIALLY
I RAISED IT IN THE SWAMP ZORA REPLIED QUIETLY IN A DEAD VOICE
SHE FELT SUDDENLY VERY YOUNG AND VERY HELPLESS--SHE WHO HAD SO JAUNTILY SET OUT TO SOLVE THIS MIGHTY PROBLEM BY A WAVING OF HER WAND
THE SWEAT OOZED ON HIS FOREHEAD
GOING GENTLY IRRESISTIBLY BUT NOT YET AT THE REALIZED GOAL
EARLY NEXT MORNING BLES SLIPPED DOWN AND IMPROVED THE NEST
SHE SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT THE BLACK WOMAN'S WAIST AND BEGAN
NEXT INSTANT SHE WAS STAGGERING ALONG THE PATH WHITHER ZORA POINTED
YOU HAVE BEEN TO ELSPETH'S CABIN
WAS IT ALL STRAIGHT OR DID THE WHOLE MOVE CONCEAL A TRICK
IT WOULD TAKE STRONG INFLUENCE TO PULL HIM THROUGH AND IF THAT STRONG INFLUENCE WERE FOUND SAID MRS VANDERPOOL THOUGHTFULLY
THERE WAS REPRESENTATIVE TODD AND SOMEBODY NAMED ALWYN--NOBODY OF IMPORTANCE
BY AND BY WHILE THE FAMILY WAS AT LUNCH SHE FOLDED THE SILVER FLEECE CAREFULLY AND LOCKED IT IN HER NEW TRUNK
THEY WERE A COMFORTABLE AND SOMETIMES MERRY PARTY
SUPPOSE HE SHOULD DEFEND THE EDUCATION BILL AND CRITICISE THE PARTY ASKED MISS WYNN
SHE HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS OF POWER SAVE THE MOTIVE FOR DOING ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
SHE SMILED AND SAID SWEETLY WON'T YOU SIT BUT DESPITE ALL THIS HER MIND SEEMED LEAPING BACKWARD A THOUSAND YEARS
I'LL SEE TO THIS COTTON MARY TAYLOR'S SMILE HAD REWARDED HIM
MR TEERSWELL WAS HANDSOME AND INDOLENT WITH INDECISION IN HIS FACE AND A CYNICAL VOICE
HERE AM I--SEND ME AND THEN SHE WALKED OUT
HE STARTED UP FOR THE SECRETARY WAS SPEAKING TO HIM
HE WAS BUSINESS MANAGER OF THE SCHOOL AND WAS DOING WELL BUT SHE WANTED TO POINT OUT TO HIM THE LARGER FIELD
MISS JONES--MR ALWYN OF SHE PAUSED A SECOND--"ALABAMA
ZORA I WANT MY PIN BLES STARTED AND STARED
WAIT TILL JIM GETS ON THE BENCH HE GROWLED
SHE DID NOT LAUGH OR MOCK SHE SIMPLY SAT AND WATCHED AND WONDERED
BLACK FIFTEEN COUNTRY-BRED STRONG CLEAR-EYED
GOOD-EVENING SAID BLES CHEERILY
HE WRITHED IN SOUL
AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IMPROVEMENTS BUT THE COLONEL AROSE
HE WAS NOT ONE TO KEEP UP THE STRAIN OF EFFORT A LONG TIME
I WAS GOING TO STEAL THE SEED SHE SAID
HAVEN'T I A RIGHT TO HAVE A GUN YES YOU HAVE ROB
TAYLOR CALLS THINKING THE MATTER OVER SAID HARRY CRESSWELL TO HIS FATHER I'M INCLINED TO ADVISE DRAWING THIS TAYLOR OUT A LITTLE FURTHER THE COLONEL PUFFED HIS CIGAR AND ONE EYE TWINKLED THE LID OF THE OTHER BEING AT THE MOMENT SUGGESTIVELY LOWERED
THEY SAW EACH OTHER ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT AND WHISTLE AND SMILE FADED
NAME IT MR CRESSWELL SMILED AND LEFT
ZORA RECEIVED IT IN SUCH MOTIONLESS SILENCE THAT MARY WONDERED AT HER WANT OF FEELING
BUT HOW CAN I KNOW I'LL GET YOU SOME BOOKS TO-MORROW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WISTFULLY
I WANT YOU TO WORK THE NEGRO POLITICAL SITUATION DIRECTED THE SENATOR AND BRING ME ALL THE DATA YOU CAN GET
MISS SMITH ASKED FOR IT LONG AGO
THE GIRL A NINNY WAS MISS SMITH'S SUCCINCT AND ACID CLASSIFICATION OF THE COUNTY'S FIRST FAMILY
I MAY AGREE THAT A BOY SHOULD LEARN HIGHER ARITHMETIC YET OBJECT TO HIS LOAFING IN PLOUGH-TIME
AND THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION OF ALWYN AS TREASURER WILL RAISE A HOWL FROM VIRGINIA TO TEXAS THERE IS SOME STRONG INFLUENCE BACK OF ALWYN SAID SENATOR SMITH
SHE HAD AT FIRST ALL THE INSIGNIA OF SUCCESS
HOPE YOU'LL PARDON THIS UNEXPECTED VISIT
SHE REACHED OUT AND TOOK THE WHITE STILL HANDS IN HERS AND OVER THE LADY'S FACE AGAIN FLITTED THAT STRICKEN LOOK OF AGE
YOU SHA'N'T GO
IT IS A GREAT NO AND IT KILLS THINGS
WHAT ZORA CONSIDERED
ZORA WALKED ABOUT SOFTLY AND LOOKED WHILE MISS SMITH QUIETLY SEARCHED ON DESK AND BUREAU PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE GIRL
EMMA AND TWO OTHER GIRL HELPERS WERE ON THE TIP-TOE OF EXPECTANCY
ON THE WHOLE THE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY ENJOYED THEMSELVES FROM THE MOMENT THEY DREW OUT OF JERSEY CITY TO THE AFTERNOON WHEN IN FOUR CARRIAGES THEY ROLLED BENEATH THE CURIOUS EYES OF ALL TOOMSVILLE AND SWEPT UNDER THE SHADOWED RAMPART OF THE SWAMP
AND WHATEVER THE FINISHED PICTURE MAY LACK OF COMPLETENESS THIS LACK IS DUE NOW TO THE STORY-TELLER NOW TO THE ARTIST BUT NEVER TO THE HERALD OF THE TRUTH
AND ZORA WHAT WAY DO YOU SEEK
IT'S ALL RIGHT RETURNED MISS SMITH
I'M NOT YET OVER THE HABIT COME
ZORA LOOKED SHARPLY AT HER
SHE OFTEN HIDES THERE
SHE CHUCKLED DRILY
AYE FACE IT BOLDLY--WHAT
WHY IN GOD'S NAME--WILL YOU THROW YOURSELF AWAY ON--ON SUCH A--YOU'RE JOKING--YOU SHE MOTIONED HIM TO A CHAIR
THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM CORDIALLY AND THEY STOPPED A MOMENT TO TALK WHILE THE HIDING WOMAN WATCHED
IS ALL WELL WITH YOU MR ALWYN SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
YOU HAD BETTER TALK TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE JEFFERSON BANK HE SAID POLITELY
NOW SAID MRS GREY TURNING ABOUT WE HAVEN'T BUT JUST A MOMENT AND WE WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT YOUR WORK SHE SMILED GRACIOUSLY UPON MISS SMITH
I TELL YOU BOYS WHERE THE TROUBLE LIES
PROUD CONQUERING FULL-BLOODED AND DEEP BOSOMED--A PASSIONATE MOTHER OF MEN
HE WAS FAINTLY GRASPING THE WIDER FULLER WORLD AND ITS THOUGHTS AND ASPIRATIONS
IN THE MORNING SHE PREPARED MRS VANDERPOOL'S BREAKFAST WITH UNUSUAL CARE
OF COURSE CONTINUED CRESSWELL I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NO PERSONAL DESIRE TO DABBLE IN PHILANTHROPY OR CONDUCT SCHOOLS OF ANY KIND
SUCH PROPERTY BELONGED OF RIGHT TO THE MASTER IF THE MASTER NEEDED IT
ZORA WALKED ON
MRS CRESSWELL AT FIRST DEMURRED
BLES SHE CRIED HOW CAN I GROW PURE HE LOOKED AT HER LISTLESSLY
ONLY SHE ADDED SEVERELY YOU MUSTN'T KEEP SAYING IT'S WICKED TO LIE CAUSE IT AIN'T
SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED
I AM A TEACHER IN THE M STREET HIGH SCHOOL SHE SAID AND WE HAVE SOME INTELLIGENT BOYS THERE WHO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH YES SAID THE SENATOR
I DID NOT MAKE IT
ALWYN THEN UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN THE LAND SCHEME
AND THEN WITH FOX-LIKE CAUTION SHE GUIDED HER PRIZE THROUGH THE LABYRINTHINE WINDINGS OF THE SWAMP
ALL CHANGE AWAY YONDER AT THE SCHOOL NEAR TOOMSVILLE MISS SMITH SAT WAITING FOR THE COMING OF ZORA ABSENTLY ATTENDING THE DUTIES OF THE OFFICE
THE BOY STARTED TO STORM AND DEMANDED PAY WHILE THE CONDUCTOR GLARED AT HER
HEREIN LAY AS YET HALF HIDDEN DIMLY SENSED AND ALL UNSPOKEN THE POWER OF A MIGHTY ALL-COMPELLING LOVE FOR ONE HUMAN SOUL AND THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE SOULS OF MEN
POOR CHILD
HE STIFFENED SLIGHTLY BUT PERCEPTIBLY LIKE A MAN CLICKING THE BUCKLES OF HIS READY ARMOR AND TWO TOWNSWOMEN WHO LISTENED GRADUALLY TURNED THEIR BACKS BUT REMAINED NEAR
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A BOARD OF FRIENDS OF THE SCHOOL
FOR A MOMENT SHE THOUGHT OF WRITING ALWYN NOT TO CALL
NO I'M NOT ENJOYING MYSELF SAID BLES TRUTHFULLY
BUT HE SAID NOTHING
THEN THE GIRL STILL MOTIONLESS--STILL LOOKING MISS TAYLOR THROUGH AND THROUGH--SAID WITH SLOW DELIBERATENESS
AND WHY NOT HE REGARDED HER EARNESTLY
AND YET OTHERS HAD SUDDENLY EXPLODED HURTLING HUMAN FRAGMENTS TO HEAVEN AND TO HELL
HE THRUST IT ASIDE FROM HIS SECRETARY'S VIEW AND LOOKED AT HIS LIST AS HE RANG THE BELL
CLEVER BUT NOT TRUE TO LIFE HE SAID
THE MEN SCARCELY SAW HER AND THE LADIES RAN TO HER FOR HELP IN ALL SORTS
SHE HELD HER BURNING HEAD--WAS NOT EVERYTHING PLAIN
WELL UNCLE JIM WHY AREN'T YOU AT WORK CALLED CRESSWELL FROM THE ROADSIDE
AND CLOSING HER EYES SHE FELL ASLEEP
IT WAS NEARLY NINE
THEY SEEMED ALMOST AT TIMES LIKE BLACK WHITE PEOPLE--STRANGERS IN WAY AND THOUGHT
ON YONDER STREET-CAR THE CONDUCTOR MIGHT RESERVE HIS POLITENESS FOR WHITE FOLK
DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'D LOOK AT THAT BLACK WELL SEE HERE SAID THE ASTUTE STILLINGS CHECKING THE DETAILS UPON HIS FINGERS
SHE HAD ALWAYS PICTURED HERSELF AS DIRECTING HER HUSBAND'S WORK
I ONLY WISH I COULD FEEL AS YOU DO
BUT THE FUNDS CONTINUED TO DWINDLE UNTIL SARAH SMITH ASKED HERSELF
SHE IS IN DEBT TO THE CRESSWELLS AND THEY ARE PRESSING THE CLAIM TO HER SERVICE
I KNOW THEY LOVE EACH OTHER
YOU MEAN THE COLORED NEWSPAPERS I PRESUME THE SAME WITH TEERSWELL'S CLEVER ARTICLES
WELL SHORTLY NOW FOR THAT TALK--READY AND QUITE FORGETTING MISS CRESSWELL HE BOLTED INTO THE PARLOR
THE SILENCE OF A DAY SINKING TO SLEEP
I UNDERSTOOD IT HAD TAKEN THE FIRST PRIZE MRS CRESSWELL WAS AGHAST
AND IT WAS WHAT MRS VANDERPOOL REMARKED TO ZORA AS ZORA WAS COMBING HER HAIR ON THE WEDNESDAY AFTER ELECTION
MRS VANDERPOOL REMEMBERED MRS STILLINGS PERFECTLY AND SHE WALKED THAT EVENING THROUGH UNOBTRUSIVE THOROUGHFARES AND CALLED ON MRS STILLINGS
THEN THE COMPARISONS BECAME INFINITE ENDLESS
NOTING THE FORMATION OF THE COTTON
THROUGH HER OPERA-GLASSES MARY SCANNED THEIR HAIR
BLES CAUGHT HER HAND
THE SWELLING OF HER HEART WITH INARTICULATE WONDER
AND SO IT WAS THAT THE VISION ZORA SAW IN THE SWAMP HAD BEEN REAL ENOUGH AND ALWYN FELT STRANGELY DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN NO SIGN OF GREETING ON RECOGNITION
I AM SURE YOU WILL BE HAPPIER THERE HE ROSE
THE CHAIRMAN PRODUCED CIGARS
COMMON PEOPLE TRIUMPH A MAN IS INDUCED TO BITE OFF HIS OWN NOSE AND THEN TO SING A PAEAN OF VICTORY
THEY'RE COMING HE CRIED
SHE WAS DRIFTING AWAY FROM HIM IN SOME INTANGIBLE WAY TO AN UPPER WORLD OF DRESS AND LANGUAGE AND DEPORTMENT AND THE NEW THOUGHT WAS PAIN TO HIM
THE GREAT REFUSAL 146 SEVENTEEN
ALL DAY WHITE MEN PASSED BACK AND FORWARD THROUGH THE CAR AS THROUGH A THOROUGHFARE
GOOD-BYE IN LESS THAN A WEEK THE STOREHOUSE WAS FULL AND TENANTS WERE AT WORK
HE HELPED HIS FATHER SOMETIMES WITH THE PLANTATIONS BUT HE HELPED SPASMODICALLY AND PLAYED AT WORK
THIS CAN NOT BE THE END SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE WOULD COME SALVATION
WAIT JUST A MINUTE AND SOON BLES WAS SHAKING SENATOR SMITH'S HAND
I'M NOT GOING AND HE SHUT OUT THE GLOW
THEN ALL AT ONCE A SENSE OF HIS UTTER UNWORTHINESS OVERWHELMED HIM
SHE FASCINATED HIM
THE WOMAN CONTEMPLATED BLES IN MOMENTARY PERPLEXITY THEN BOWING IN TURN LEFT
CALLED SHE REPEATED VAGUELY
PRECISELY THAT SIDE OF THE THING APPEALED TO HER BROTHER
SHE RAN INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND PLUNGED INTO HER TRUNK
SHE DISCOVERED THAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN KNEW THINGS THAT SHE COULD TALK BOOKS AND THAT SHE WAS RATHER PRETTY
BUT IT MAKES IT HARD ALREADY
SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HARRY CRESSWELL'S BUGGY AND A SCURRYING AT THE FRONT DOOR
SHE DREAMED AND SANG OVER THAT DARK FIELD AND AGAIN AND AGAIN APPEALED TO HIM
WHAT'S THAT HE ASKED
THERE ARE A MILLION COTTON FARMS IN THE SOUTH HALF RUN BY COLORED PEOPLE AND HALF BY WHITES
MEANTIME IN THE OFFICE OF SENATOR SMITH TOWARD WHICH MR EASTERLY WAS MAKING HIS WAY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE HAD BEEN CLOSETED THE DAY BEFORE
I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T TAKE NO PIN PERSONS WHO WILL LIE AND STEAL WILL DO ANYTHING WHY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE DO ANYTHING THEY WANTS TO AND YOU KNEW THE PIN WAS MINE I SAW YOU A-WEARING OF IT ADMITTED ZORA EASILY
I'M AFRAID WE'RE LATE ALREADY THE REMARK CREATED MILD CONSTERNATION
FOR A SPACE ZORA WATCHED HIM AND ONCE SHE STARTED AFTER HIM BUT CAME SLOWLY BACK AND SAT BY THE FIRE-PLACE
CAREFUL THERE GO ON DAMN YE THERE'S SOME ONE BY YON FIRE NO THERE AIN'T SEE THE BUSHES MOVE BANG
IT WAS A FACE COLD AND MASK-LIKE REGULAR AND COMELY
SHE MUST REACH CRESSWELL'S MANSION BEFORE CRESSWELL DID AND WITHOUT HIM SEEING HER
IN HER IMPETUOUS HOPE HER DEEP ENTHUSIASM AND HER STRONG WILL
WELL NOW WHEN THE SCHEME OF MAKING ALWYN TREASURER CAME UP THEY DETERMINED TO APPOINT A SOUTHERN WHITE REPUBLICAN AND GIVE ME A PLACE UNDER ALWYN
IT WOULD MAKE JUST THE DASH OF COLOR I NEED IN MY NEW PILLOW YOU MAY HAVE IT AND WELCOME
YES I AM SHE REPLIED WITH UNMISTAKABLE POSITIVENESS
THE BLACK WORLD FILTERING DOWN FROM DOORWAYS TO SIDE-WALK AND CURB
THEY SHOUTED CLAPPED AND WAVED WHILE HE SAT IN BLANK AMAZEMENT AND WAS WITH DIFFICULTY FORCED TO THE ROSTRUM TO BOW AGAIN AND AGAIN
IF SHE HAD WANTED HIM--AND AH GOD
I DON'T TRY
BUT SHE LISTENED GLADLY FOR WITHOUT SHE HEARD THE SOLEMN BEATING OF THE SEA THE MIGHTY RHYTHMIC BEATING OF THE SEA
IT WAS THE LADY NEXT TO HIM AND SHE WAS COLORED
MOREOVER HE WAS SURE THAT IT WAS MISS TAYLOR WITH WHOM THIS BOY HAD BEEN TALKING SO LONG AND FAMILIARLY IN THE COTTON-FIELD LAST SPRING--AN OFFENCE DOUBLY HEINOUS NOW THAT HE HAD SEEN MISS TAYLOR
THIS SUMMER PROMISED TO BE UNUSUALLY LONESOME FOR HER AND SHE WAS MEDITATING A RETREAT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS NORTH SHORE WHEN SHE CHANCED TO MEET MARY TAYLOR AT A MISCELLANEOUS DINNER AND FOUND HER INTERESTING
IN HER IMAGINATION THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE HALF DOZEN GLEAMING BUILDINGS PERCHED ALOFT SEEMED PORTENTOUS--BIG WITH THE DESTINY NOT SIMPLY OF A COUNTY AND A STATE BUT OF A RACE--A NATION--A WORLD
WHAT DID YOU DISAGREE ABOUT SHE ASKED BLUNTLY
OBEDIENTLY HE BENT OVER THE LITTLE HANDS THAT SEEMED SO SOFT AND THIN
BUT IF THEY COULD NOT BE HAD EASTERLY DECLARED IT WOULD BE GOOD POLITICS TO NOMINATE CRESSWELL AND GIVE HIM REPUBLICAN SUPPORT
BUT--WE'RE NOT--ER--EXACTLY WELCOMED
LET'S GET A BIT OF IT AND HIDE IT HERE IN THE SWAMP AND COMB IT AND TEND IT AND MAKE IT THE BEAUTIFULLEST BIT OF ALL
ALWYN STRUCK HIM AS A WELL-BALANCED FELLOW AND HE THOUGHT HE DESERVED THE OFFICE
BUT I'M QUITE THROUGH TRYING TO TURN NATURAL SERVANTS INTO MASTERS OF ME AND MINE
ON HER PART MISS CRESSWELL WAS VASTLY AMUSED
I WANT YOU PARTICULARLY AT ANOTHER TIME SHE MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED HIS ANXIETY BUT TODAY SHE WAS AGITATED
SHE HELD THE CODE OF HER SOCIAL SET WITH SPORTSMANLIKE HONOR
HE BOUGHT AN ARMFUL OF BOOKS AND A DESK AND PLUNGED DESPERATELY TO WORK
THERE CAME A SILENCE IN THE COURT
YOU'RE CRAZY AND SHE STROLLED OUT TO THE PORCH EXCHANGED SOME REMARKS WITH A PASSING SERVANT AND THEN NESTLED COMFORTABLY INTO A HAMMOCK
I HAVE THAT ON THE BEST AUTHORITY SAID ONE
THE WHOLE FIELD WAS WAVING AND SHIVERING IN THE SUNLIGHT
BUT MAIDENS SHOULD ALSO COME BACK AND WHEN AFTER THE LAPSE OF MANY MINUTES MARY DID NOT REAPPEAR HE FOLLOWED HER FOOTSTEPS TO THE SWAMP
I PROMISED--AND--I LIED
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW AND I THOUGHT THAT--THAT PURITY WAS JUST WANTING TO BE PURE HE GROUND HIS TEETH IN FURY
WE PROPOSE TO OWN THE COTTON BELT OF THE SOUTH COLONEL CRESSWELL STARTED INDIGNANTLY FROM HIS SEAT
HERE IN THE SHADOW OF THE WOOD SHE LINGERED
WITH HARRY IT WAS DIFFERENT
GREAT PILES THAT CHALLENGED HEAVEN AND HOMES CROWDED ON HOMES TILL ONE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE FULL OF LIVING THINGS
YOU NEVER HAD A WITCH FOR A MAMMY--DID YOU NO WELL THEN YOU SEE I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND SEE THINGS FOR YOU ZORA HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY YOU MUST LEARN TO READ WHAT FOR SO THAT YOU CAN READ BOOKS AND KNOW LOTS OF THINGS DON'T WHITE FOLKS MAKE BOOKS YES--MOST OF THE BOOKS POOH
WHAT OF IT SHE DEMANDED
THEY TURNED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND PASSED THROUGH LONG STRETCHES OF PLOUGHED AND TUMBLED FIELDS AND OTHER FIELDS BROWN WITH THE DEAD GHOSTS OF PAST YEARS COTTON STANDING STRAGGLING AND WEATHER-WORN
LONG ECHOING CRIES LEAPT TO AND FRO
STILLINGS LOOKED INTO THE GLASS AND SCOWLED
OH YES
THE GREATEST OFFICE EVER HELD BY A NEGRO IN AMERICA--GREATER THAN DOUGLASS OR BRUCE OR LYNCH HAD HELD--A LANDMARK A LIVING EXAMPLE AND INSPIRATION
HE MURMURED SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING WET AND DREW UP AT THE TOOMSVILLE BANK
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY MY SISTER WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU BUT OH I REALIZE THE--DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T MIND RIDING BY SOME DAY--IT'S EMBARRASSING TO SUGGEST THIS BUT YOU KNOW MISS TAYLOR WAS PERFECTLY SELF-POSSESSED
HE SAID WHAT ZORA WANTED TO SAY WITH TWO GREAT DIFFERENCES
OH NO HE ANSWERED DEFTLY
AND ALREADY SHE WAS ACQUIRING THAT POISE OF THE HEAD AND A MANNER OF DIRECTING THE SERVANTS WHICH SHOWED HER BORN TO THE PURPLE
WHAT EXCLAIMED BLES ALOUD
ZORA ECHOED THE CRY FAINTLY
SHE MADE HERSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS SHE COULD AND TRIED TO PUT THE MATTER FROM HER MIND
SHE HEARD THE HEAVY FOOTSTEPS CRASHING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH--COMING COMING AS FROM THE END OF THE WORLD
BUT MISS WYNN WAS ATTRACTED BY THE PERSONALITY OF BLES ALWYN
CONTINUALLY SUCH THOUGHTS WERE SURGING THROUGH HIS BRAIN AND THEY WERE RIOTING THROUGH IT AGAIN AS HE SAT WAITING IN SENATOR SMITH'S OFFICE
NO ONE COULD MEET DAILY A HUNDRED OR MORE OF THESE LIGHT-HEARTED GOOD-NATURED CHILDREN WITHOUT FEELING DRAWN TO THEM
IT LAY IN SOME GREAT TWISTED CLOUD AND IN THAT BLACK NET GOWN OF MINE ZORA WAS SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT
AND THERE AGAIN THE BLACK MEN SANG LIKE DARK EARTH-SPIRITS FLITTING IN TWILIGHT
YET IT WAS FAR AND HE FEARED AND RAN WITH STARTLED EYES
BUT I COULD HARDLY AFFORD TO GIVE UP MY POSITION WE'LL ARRANGE FOR A LEAVE OF ABSENCE THEN I'LL TRY SIR WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT AS PAY I SUPPOSE MY SALARY WOULD STOP I MEAN IN ADDITION TO THAT OH NOTHING SIR
OF MORNINGS ZORA WOULD HURRY THROUGH HER LESSONS AND GET EXCUSED TO FLY TO THE SWAMP TO WORK AND DREAM ALONE
SOME ARE WHISPERING THAT YOU BROUGHT HER IN PURPOSELY TO FORCE SOCIAL EQUALITY
WHY SHOULD YOU SPOIL THIS BLACK GIRL AND PUT IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS INTO HER HEAD
SHE SETTLED HERSELF ALMOST LUXURIOUSLY AND BEGAN THE STORY OF JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS
BUT EMMA IN HER UNEMOTIONAL WAY WAS A BORN NURSE AND DID MUCH GOOD AMONG THE SICK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SHE WILL TELL THE TRUTH AND ALL WILL BE WELL HIS MIND SAID
THIS YANKEE TAYLOR IS A NIGGER-LOVER
HIS HANDS GOT IN THE WAY AND HE FOUND NO NATURAL NOOK IN ALL THOSE WIDE AND TASTEFULLY FURNISHED ROOMS
UNLESS THEN TANGIBLE RESULTS CAME AND CAME QUICKLY HE WAS LIABLE TO RELAPSE INTO OLD HABITS
WHY ZORA ASKED MISS SMITH CALMLY
IN YONDER STORE NOTHING HINDERED THE CLERK FROM BEING EXCEPTIONALLY PERT
THEN IT CAME
WHAT IS THE MATTER ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL INQUIRED FOR SHE SEEMED TO SEE IN THE GIRL'S FACE AND CARRIAGE SOME SUBTLE CHANGE
A SENSE OF HIS SMALLNESS AND NARROWNESS OF HIS PRIGGISH BLINDNESS ROSE LIKE A MOCKERY IN HIS SOUL
ON CAME THE DRESSMAKER'S FOOTSTEPS--THEN HER DOOR WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY BURST OPEN
THE BEST PEOPLE ALL ATTEND BLES HESITATED
WHAT WAS--AND THERE WAS FEAR IN HER HEART
NO ZORA SHE SAID THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANT MORE THAN HIM AND SOMETHING YOU CAN HAVE WHAT ASKED THE WONDERING GIRL
NO THOUGHT OF YOU BUT AS A TEACHER HAS YET ENTERED HIS DEAR SIMPLE HEAD
HE TALKED THIS INCESSANTLY INTO GREY BUT GREY CONTINUED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD
NOW THEN IF WE CAN GET THE BANKS WHOLESALE MERCHANTS AND BIGGEST PLANTERS INTO LINE WE CAN CONTROL THE COTTON CROP BUT OBJECTED HARRY CRESSWELL WHILE THE BANKS AND THE LARGE MERCHANTS MAY BE POSSIBILITIES DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO TRY TO GET PLANTERS INTO LINE YES I DO
SOME OF THE INTEREST WAS SELFISH FOR ZORA WAS GOING TO BE A PERFECT MAID
I'M SURE HE BEFORE SHE COULD FINISH AN OVERSEER RODE UP
I AM FROM ALABAMA HE BEGAN EARNESTLY AND I KNOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THEN HE TOLD OF GOVERNMENT AND CONDITIONS IN THE BLACK BELT OF THE LYING OPPRESSION AND HELPLESSNESS OF THE SODDEN BLACK MASSES
NEVER MIND ZORA
YOU CAN FINISH THE FIRST YEAR WITH THIS MONEY BLES ASSURED HER DELIGHTED AND THEN NEXT YEAR YOU MUST COME IN TO BOARD
SOMEONE MENTIONED HER NAME AND ONE OR TWO GLANCES OF INTEREST AND EVEN CURIOSITY WERE THROWN HER WAY
AND SEE HERE NEXT WEEK COTTON CHOPPING BEGINS--YOU'LL GO TO THE FIELDS OR TO THE CHAIN-GANG
WE'VE GOT EM BEHIND US--WITH BIG CHUNKS OF STOCK AND A SIGNED IRON-CLAD AGREEMENT
HER LITTLE HANDS GROPED AND WANDERED OVER HIS CLOSE-CURLED HAIR AND SHE SOBBED DEEP VOICED
IT WAS NO DEED BUT A COMPLICATED CONTRACT BINDING THE TENANT HAND AND FOOT TO THE LANDLORD
THEY WENT OUT AGAIN AND WANDERED DOWN NEAR THE OLD LAGOON
THEY WERE A CHEAP PLAIN PAIR BUT DAINTY AND THEY FITTED WELL
HE TALKED OF LITTLE CHILDREN
SILENTLY HE KISSED HER LIPS
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM ASKED THE COLONEL SHARPLY
I'M--PURE SHE SAID WITH A STRANGE LITTLE BREAKING VOICE AND GESTURE
DON'T YOU SEE THE TWO SCHEMES CAN'T MIX
SHE TOO HAD FELT THAT THE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS OF ALWYN AND MRS CRESSWELL WERE INDISCREET BUT SHE HOPED THAT THEY HAD ATTRACTED NO ONE ELSE'S ATTENTION
WELL I VOLUNTEERED ADVICE ONCE IN THIS CASE AND I SHA'N'T REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT SOON SAID CRESSWELL LAUGHING
YES SHE SAID SLOWLY WE MUST HELP HIM AND AFTER HE RISES HE WILL MARRY WHOM THE WOMAN HE LOVES RETURNED ZORA QUIETLY
A SMALL GROUP OF EDUCATED NEGROES ARE TRYING TO INDUCE THE REST TO PUNISH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR NOT PROTECTING THEM
ONCE IT HAD VIGOR TO SING THE SONG OF THE MILL KNEW NO RESTING
WHY MISS TAYLOR
YET HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE RESTLESS UNHAPPY
BUT WHAT HAD HE THOUGHT
HIS BOUNTY SURROUNDS YOU--THE TREES THE FIELDS THE GLORIOUS SUN
I'M SURE IT'S BLES
HE WENT ON
THE CANAL WENT STRAIGHT A HUNDRED YARDS THROUGH STUBBORN SOIL AND IT WAS OOZING NOW WITH SLIMY WATERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REPRESENT NOR JUST HOW INFLUENTIAL THEY ARE WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU ASKED SENATOR SMITH
THEY LIKED THE SAME VOICE BUT NOT THE SAME SONG
BUT HERE IN ALABAMA BROUGHT CLOSELY AND INTIMATELY IN TOUCH WITH THESE DARK SKINNED CHILDREN THEIR COLOR STRUCK HER AT FIRST WITH A SORT OF TERROR--IT SEEMED OMINOUS AND FORBIDDING
MRS CRESSWELL ROSE TO HER FEET
SHE WOULD GLANCE UP THE DOOR WOULD OPEN SOFTLY AND JUST HERE SHE DID GLANCE UP AND ALL THE SCHOOL GLANCED WITH HER
I REMEMBER NOW VERY WELL WELL I WANTS TO SEE MR HARRY VERY MUCH
YOU'SE WORKING AND I'SE GOING TO WORK BUT--ZORA--YOU'RE NOT USED TO SUCH WORK AND I AM
SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD SAT A GREAT DIM INJUSTICE WHICH HAD VEILED THE LIGHT BEFORE HER YOUNG EYES JUST AS SHE RAISED THEM TO THE MORNING
SHE SIGHED HE WATCHING HER EAGERLY
I'LL PICK COTTON CAN YOU COURSE I CAN IT'S HARD WORK SHE HESITATED
HE MUST NOT FIND HER HERE--NOT HERE
THE TREBLE CLEF GIVES A CONCERT AND EVERYBODY THAT'S ANYBODY WILL BE THERE THEY MET AGAIN THE FOLLOWING EVENING AND PROCEEDED TO THE CHURCH
THE COTTON LAY IN SILKEN HANDFULS CLEAN AND SHIMMERING WITH THREADS FULL TWO INCHES LONG
HE IS THE WORLD
THE WIDE BASKETS POISED ALOFT FOAMED ON THE ERECT AND SWAYING BODIES OF THE DARK CARRIERS
THE WORKERS DROPPED THEIR TOOLS
YOU KNOW I LOVED HER DEARLY AS A BOY--HOW DEARLY I HAVE ONLY JUST BEGUN TO REALIZE
ZORA I NEED SOME ONE TO HELP ME--TO DO MY HAIR AND SERVE MY COFFEE AND DRESS AND TAKE CARE OF ME
BUT COULD SHE DO IT
HE HAD NOT SEEN HER SINCE THAT MOMENT AT THE BALL AND HE WAS STARTLED AT THE CHANGE
YET ALL WAS NOT LOST IF HER HUSBAND CONTINUED TO BELIEVE IN HER
DOWN WHERE THE TOOMSVILLE-MONTGOMERY HIGHWAY DIPPED TO THE STREAM THAT FED THE CRESSWELL SWAMP SQUATTED A SQUARE BARN THAT SLEPT THROUGH DAY AND WEEKS IN DULL INDIFFERENCE
SHE WAS A BORN LEADER WEDDED TO A GREAT CAUSE
SHOW OFF
WELL REPORTED EASTERLY HANGING UP THE RECEIVER WE MAY LAND HIM
SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES AND BURIED HER FACE IN THE FILMY FOLDS OF THE SILVER FLEECE
SOME CAUTIOUS FLIERS ON THE MARKET GAVE HIM ENOUGH SURPLUS TO SEND HIS SISTER MARY THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL OF HIS COUNTRY HOME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND AFTERWARD THROUGH WELLESLEY COLLEGE
SHE KNEW THAT HARRY CRESSWELL WAS NOT ALL HE SHOULD BE AND SHE KNEW TOO THAT MANY OTHER MEN WERE NOT
AFTER ONE LOOK AT THAT SORROW-STRICKEN FACE MARY TURNED AWAY
HE SENT FOR THE SHERIFF AND RECEIVED HIM AT THE OAKS IN HIS MOST RESPECTABLE STYLE FILLING HIM WITH GOOD FOOD AND WARMING HIM WITH GOOD LIQUOR
BUT HERE COME THE LADIES HE WENT FORWARD AT ONCE BUT JOHN TAYLOR DREW BACK
BUT THE GIRL IS--NOTORIOUS ON THE LOVERS THE WORDS FELL LIKE A BLOW
TWO WEEKS LATER FOUND ALWYN ON THE TRAIN FACING SOUTHWARD IN THE JIM CROW CAR
BUT I DON'T WANT US TO BE THE ONLY ONES THAT COUNT
WE VEIL IT A LITTLE AND LAUGH AS LIGHTLY AS WE CAN
I DON'T COUNT ALL WHITE MEN MY EQUALS I ADMIT HE RETURNED WITH DIGNITY BUT I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WHITE MAN AND A NIGGER COLTON STRETCHED OUT HIS MASSIVE HAND
FOLLOW ME THE HOUR WAS HALFWAY BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN BUT NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE LEAPT FRENZIEDLY TO THEIR FEET
ZORA YOUR PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO WORK AND WORK STEADILY AND WORK HARD SHE STOPPED FOR SHE WAS SURE ZORA WAS NOT LISTENING
THE DRIVERS AND HELPERS WERE LOLLING AND LAUGHING AND SINGING BUT MISS TAYLOR DID NOT HEAR NOR SEE
SHE TOOK THE WOMAN'S ARM AND WALKED WITH HER
MOREOVER IN MATTER OF PROPRIETY I DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE USUALLY FOUND MY IDEAS TOO LAX--RATHER THE OPPOSITE THERE THERE DEAR
MR CRESSWELL HOWEVER LOOKED AT A BATH-ROOM AND SMILED
JUST THEN COLONEL CRESSWELL RODE UP BEHIND AND GREETED HER
SHE BEGAN AGAIN RAPIDLY
THROUGH YONDER DOORWAY HAD TROOPED AN ARMY OF HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF BRIGHT AND DULL LIGHT AND DARK EAGER AND SULLEN FACES
FOR YONDER WAS ZORA POISED WAITING
IF SHE PASSED THEM SHE WOULD SEE SOMETHING--SHE ALWAYS SAW SOMETHING--THAT WOULD SEND THE RED BLOOD WHIRLING MADLY
YOU SEE I SAW THE BUILDINGS AND FORGOT THE MEN
MANY MEN MORE WOMEN AND GREATER AND GREATER THRONGS OF CHILDREN
OH HARRY
OH HARRY
YOU'RE TOO EASY FATHER
WITHOUT A LAWYER IN COURT ZORA
I AM THERE SHE RETURNED WITH UNMISTAKABLE SIMPLICITY OF ABSOLUTE CONVICTION
I KNOWS A HEAP OF TINGS IN DIS WORLD AND IN DE NEXT THIS IS A GREAT COTTON COUNTRY DEY DON'T RAISE NO COTTON NOW TO WHAT DEY USED TO WHEN OLD GEN'REL CRESSWELL FUST COME FROM CAROLINA
SUDDENLY SHE BECAME AWARE OF HER LONG SILENCE AND THE SILENCE OF THE BOY
IT WAS A FULL MONTH AFTER SCHOOL HAD BEGUN WHEN THEY TOGETHER BACK IN THE SWAMP SHADOWED BY THE FOLIAGE BEGAN TO FASHION THE WONDERFUL GARMENT
USUALLY WHILE HE PLAYED AT LOVING WOMEN GROVELLED
THE HAND OF ELSPETH WAS GONE BUT THE SONG WAS STILL THERE
SO AM I
IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BY'"--THE SENATOR DID NOT READ THE NAME
GOOD
GOOD
HER EYES GREW OLD AND TIRED
AND SINGERS SAID MARY TAYLOR
HE THOUGHT OF CRESSWELL'S BITTER WORDS
HER FRENCH MAID ON WHOM SHE HAD DEPENDED ABSOLUTELY FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE HAD LEFT HER
BUT THE SEPARATION FROM HER HUSBAND AND AMERICA WOULD BE FOREVER
YES SHE WOULD SHOW BLES THE PLACE THAT VERY NIGHT
SAY THERE'S A NEGRO CLERK IN THE TREASURY NAMED ALWYN I KNOW HIM--I HAD HIM APPOINTED GOOD
HE TURNED AND TOOK UP A CIRCULAR ISSUED BY THE CIVIC CLUB GIVING A CAREFUL ACCOUNT OF THEIR ENDEAVORS TO AMEND AND PASS THE CHILD LABOR BILL
IT'S THE BEST LAND ABOUT HERE AND ABOUT THE ONLY LAND YOU CAN BUY--I WOULDN'T SELL IT TO ANYBODY ELSE SHE STILL HESITATED
AND YET SHE WAS A NEGRO SHE HAD GIVEN HIM VALUABLE INFORMATION WHICH HE HAD SOUGHT IN VAIN ELSEWHERE AND THE EVENT PROVED IT CORRECT
A WHITE MAN WAS TOSSING INTO THE FLAMES DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES--A FEATHER BED A BEDSTEAD TWO RICKETY CHAIRS
SHE BIT HER LIP CRUELLY
I TRIED TO SENATOR SMITH THOUGHTFULLY LOOKED HIM OVER AND DREW OUT THE LETTERS
NINE O'CLOCK CAME AND NO ONE WITH IT
WHEN SHALL I BEGIN THE CHAIRMAN CONSULTED HIS CALENDAR
HER FORM IS PERFECT HER HEIGHT IS REGAL HER SKIN IS SATIN AND MY JEWELS FOUND A RESTING PLACE AT LAST
THE LAWN WAS WELL TENDED AND THE FLOWERS
WHERE WAS THE POOR SPOILED WOMAN
HE COULD CONCEIVE OF NO FINER STARTING-PLACE BUT HE SAID NOTHING
HE HEARD THE HOOFS OF HORSES AGAIN
MRS VANDERPOOL TO BE FRANK I KNOW SOME EXCELLENT INVESTMENTS THAT YOUR INFLUENCE IN THIS LINE WOULD HELP
SHE WAS FAT AND BLACK HOODED AND APRONED WITH GREAT ROUND HEAD AND MASSIVE BOSOM
MISCHIEVOUS SECRETIVE BROODING
THE WORDS LEAPED AND FLEW FROM HIS LIPS AS HE LASHED THE THRONG WITH BITTER FURY
IT WAS DARK AND HAUNTING AND EVER AND AGAIN ROSE LONELY NIGHT CRIES
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE CRESSWELLS ASKED FOR A LITTLE OF THE POLITICAL PIE THE COLONEL SMILINGLY OPENED
THAT LAST DROP MEANS LIABILITIES OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO US HE SAID SLOWLY
YOU MEAN YOUSE GWINE TO GIT YO LIVIN OFF IT YES ANSWERED ALWYN
SHE HAD ASKED EMMA ONCE IF SHE LIKED BLES AND EMMA HAD REPLIED IN HER INNOCENT WAY OH SO MUCH AS FOR BLES HE WAS OFTEN SAYING WHAT A DEAR CHILD EMMA WAS
IN TOWN ALWYN WENT TO ALL THE CHIEF MERCHANTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND RECEIVED TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE PRACTICALLY THE SAME ESTIMATE
IT WAS MUCH AS THOUGH SHE WERE TALKING TO SOME ONE FROM ANOTHER WORLD--AN OUTSIDER
HE PRESENTLY BOUNDED TO HIS FEET
ONE OR TWO MEETINGS WERE HELD AND THE FLAME OF RACIAL PREJUDICE WAS STUDIOUSLY FANNED
NEVER BE UTTERLY DESPICABLE IN THE EYES OF THE MAN SHE HAD LOVED
GET A LAWYER HE ORDERED
AND YOU ARE STILL FRIENDLY WITH HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
BY GOD IF YOU WANT TO MAKE LOVE GO TO THE SWAMP HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS WHILE AN ASHY PALENESS STOLE BENEATH THE DARK-RED BRONZE OF ZORA'S FACE
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE SHE DEMANDED EYEING THE BASKET
WELL SHE ASKED IN THAT BRUSQUE MANNER WHEREWITH HER NATURAL TIMIDITY WAS WONT TO MASK HER KINDNESS
WHEN SHE HAD AN OFFER TO TEACH IN THE SOUTH JOHN TAYLOR HURRIED HER OFF FOR TWO REASONS
THAT MRS GREY IS GOING TO GET RID OF SOME OF HER SURPLUS CASH--IS GOING TO ENDOW SOME NIGGER SCHOOLS TAYLOR DRILY RETORTED
BUT SHE DID NOT CARE MUCH AND BUT FEEBLY WARDED THE BLOWS AWAY FOR SHE WAS VERY TIRED
THIS IS MY UNIVERSITY ZORA EXPLAINED SMILING AT HIS INTERESTED SURVEY
AND THAT WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE SILVER FLEECE
SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE LOUNGE AND HER FINGERS CREPT ALONG THE CUSHIONS
THE FORM OF ELSPETH BLURRED THE NIGHT DIMLY FAR OFF ALMOST DISAPPEARING AND THEN GROWING BLACKER AND LARGER
WHAT A FIELD OF COTTON
I AM AT MY WITS END
THE COLONEL SCOWLED FOR IT WAS ALL CLEAR TO HIM NOW
SLOWLY HER EYES GREW WIDE
THE NEXT DAY MISS SMITH SAID TO HER WHEN SHE CAME IN
WHAT FOR WHAT FOR SHE ANSWERED
ALWYN WAS STARING MOODILY AHEAD
HARRY SHE ASKED AGAIN AS HE SLIPPED ON HIS COAT
MR CRESSWELL KNEW THE NEGRO BY SIGHT AND DISLIKED HIM
SUCH A BUSINESS-LIKE PROPOSITION FROM NEGROES SURPRISED HIM
WON'T YOU TRY PLEADED THE YOUNGER
WHILE SHE WHO HAD AIMED SO HIGH HAD FALLEN PITEOUSLY
BUT IF SHE WENT THERE WHAT WOULD SHE SEE AND DO AND WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO BECOME SUCH A WOMAN AS MISS SMITH PICTURED
YET ALWYN VENTURED TO VOICE DOUBTS
I SUPPOSE SHE SAID THAT YOU FURNISH COOKS FOR THE COUNTY LARGELY SAID MISS SMITH
SEE HERE
SEE HERE
SEE HERE
SEE HERE
WHERE HAD MRS CRESSWELL SEEN HER BEFORE
BUT ZORA STILL STOOD SILENT IN THE SHADOW OF THE SILVER FLEECE HEARING AND YET NOT HEARING
THEY WERE AT SUPPER NOW HE WHISPERED--THE FATHER AND OLD MOTHER AWAY BACK YONDER BEYOND THE NIGHT
BESIDES COTTON FELL A LITTLE TODAY--ELEVEN TO TEN AND THREE-FOURTHS
THEY DON'T NEVER WORK
SHE MUST ATONE
IT'S BURIED
THE CHILDREN HAD GATHERED QUIETLY ALMOST TIMIDLY AND BEFORE THE DISTINGUISHED COMPANY REALIZED IT THEY TURNED TO MEET THAT BATTERY OF FOUR HUNDRED EYES
SHE HAD WISHED TO ABSORB HIM AND HIS WORK FOR HER OWN GLORY
SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING TO DESCEND GRACIOUSLY BUT AUTHORITATIVELY UPON SOME SHRINKING GIRL BUT THIS WOMAN NOT ONLY SEEMED TO ASSUME EQUALITY BUT ACTUALLY LOOKED IT
HE CONSENTED TO DO SO AND SIGNED THIS CONTRACT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SON-IN-LAW JUST THEN JOHN TAYLOR CAME INTO THE COURT AND CRESSWELL BECKONED TO HIM
BUT HE SPOKE COLDLY
WHAT YOU RUN FOR SHE ASKED WITH DANCING MISCHIEF IN HER EYES
THUS HE FORMULATED HIS QUESTIONS AS HE WENT HALF TIMID AND FEARFUL IN PUTTING THEM AND YET DETERMINED TO KNOW
AND YET HE WENT HOME AND SAT DOWN AND WROTE A LONG LETTER TO MISS SMITH
LET'S HAVE HIM UP WHEN THE SUB-COMMITTEE MEETS TO-MORROW BLES ALWYN HURRIED UP TO SENATOR SMITH'S OFFICE HOPING TO HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT THE SCHOOL
THAT'S WHAT I'M TEACHING THESE CHILDREN HERE--TO COUNT AND NOT TO BE LIKE DUMB DRIVEN CATTLE
BUT FROM THE OFFER THAT CAME TO TEACH NEGROES--COUNTRY NEGROES AND LITTLE ONES AT THAT--SHE SHRANK AND INDEED PROBABLY WOULD HAVE REFUSED IT OUT OF HAND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER QUEER BROTHER JOHN
ZORA MOVED ABOUT AMONG THE MEN WHISPERING AND EXPLAINING
WHERE'S ZORA SOME ONE YELLED WITH AN OATH
IT HAD BEEN A HARD BEGINNING WITH SUSPICION AND SQUALOR AROUND
THEY'RE THE LOWEST-DOWN ORNRIEST--BEGGING YOUR PARDON--GOOD-FOR-NOTHING LOAFERS YOU EVER HEARD OF
MEET ME IN NEW YORK SAY--LET'S SEE THIS IS MARCH TENTH--WELL MAY THIRD YOUNG CRESSWELL WAS THINKING RAPIDLY
SHE COLLECTED STATISTICS FOR SEVERAL OF THE COMMITTEE WROTE LETTERS INTERVIEWED A FEW PERSONS AND FELT HERSELF GROWING IN USEFULNESS AND IMPORTANCE
MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED
MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED
HER OWN EYES SOFTENED HER GRIP BECAME A CARESS BUT HER HEART WAS HARD
SHE SHRANK STILL FARTHER BACK AND A SHADOW SWEPT THE DOOR
BUT THE WORLD DOESN'T THE WORLD YES THE WORLD
SHE SAT DOWN
MRS VANDERPOOL WATCHED HER A WHILE
WE ARE GOING TO WIN EASILY BUT OUR MAJORITY IN CONGRESS FOR CERTAIN MATTERS WILL DEPEND ON THE ATTITUDE OF SOUTHERNERS AND YOU USUALLY SPEND THE WINTERS IN WASHINGTON
AND THEN SHE WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WAS NO ORDINARY SCENE
AND SIGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF TO-MORROW'S DRUDGERY SHE DETERMINED TO CONSULT MISS SMITH IN THE MORNING
MR SMITH SNAPPED HIS FINGERS AND RANG THE BELL
THERE IS A MAN--A COLORED MAN--WAITING TO SEE YOU IN THE BACK HALL BUT I GUESS HE CAN WAIT UNTIL AFTER LUNCH THEY ATE LEISURELY
YOU MEAN THE SMITHS OF BOSTON ASKED MISS JONES
MRS VANDERPOOL RECOGNIZED AND GREETED THE GIRL AS MISS WYNN
SHE WOULD UNHINDERED DEVELOP TO A BRILLIANT SUMPTUOUS WOMANHOOD
SHE MUST GO DOWN AND MEET HIM AT BREAKFAST AND TALK FRANKLY WITH HIM
OF COURSE WE'VE GOT TO LET HER PLAY WITH HER INCOME AND THAT'S CONSIDERABLE
IT LOOKED WARM AND SHE WAS COLD
AND WHAT SHALL YOU DO SHE ASKED
OH MURMURED MISS TAYLOR
WHY ZORA QUICKLY ASKED
NOT ONLY IN FRAMING NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN OUR OWN INTERESTS BUT ALWAYS IN STATE LAWS
HE WAS NOT YET INURED TO THE WAYS OF HIGH FINANCE AND THE PROGRAMME OF THE COTTON BARONS AS UNFOLDED THAT DAY LAY HEAVY ON HIS MIND DESPITE ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY
BUT HE WOULD NOT SELL ANY MORE SHE WAS SURE EVEN NOW WHEN THE PROMISE OF WEALTH FACED THE SCHOOL
SHE'S PLAYING A BIGGER POLITICAL GAME THAN I LAID OUT FOR HER
THEN SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY THRILLED WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF MRS VANDERPOOL'S CHECK
I--I THINK WHEN OUR PEOPLE HE HESITATED
HE HAD SAT HELPLESS AND INACTIVE IN THE GRIP OF GREAT AND SHADOWED HANDS AND THE THING WAS AS YET INCOMPREHENSIBLE
THE GIRL HAD BITTERLY RESENTED HER EXPERIENCES AT FIRST
HE SHUDDERED BUT FOR A MOMENT HE COULD NOT STIR
HE WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS EXALTATION
BUT DON'T BE FOOLISH--HIDE IT
I'SE CALLED ON THE BED THE CHILD SMILED IN ITS DREAMING
ZORA DID NOT GO FAR
YOU WILL HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED SAID THE MAN
WHAT ELSE COULD SHE HAVE DREAMED
THE CAR SEEMED CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE BUT STRANGELY SHORT
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER WAGES THAN YOU EVER GOT
IN NEW AND INTRICATE WAYS WITH SOFT SHADOWINGS AND COVERINGS SHE WOVE IN THAT WHITE VEIL HER OWN STRANGE SOUL AND MRS VANDERPOOL WATCHED HER CURIOUSLY BUT IN SILENCE
ALL DAY SATURDAY AND PART OF SUNDAY THEY WORKED FEVERISHLY
DE SEED DONE SOWED TEN MR
MOSTLY I DREAMS
SOME HAD OLD STEPS ABOVE THE WORN CLAY SIDE-WALKS AND SOME WERE FLUSH WITH THE GROUND
A MONTH AGO SHE HAD NOT DREAMED THAT HUMAN INTEREST IN ANYBODY WOULD TAKE SO STRONG A HOLD UPON HER AS HER LIKING FOR ZORA HAD DONE
WHY WAS THE PUZZLE OF LIFE SUDDENLY SO INTRICATE WHEN BUT A LITTLE WEEK AGO SHE WAS READING IT AND ITS BEAUTY AND WISDOM AND POWER WERE THRILLING HER DELIGHTED HANDS
BUT I'VE DABBLED A BIT IN SCULPTURE INDEED MRS VANDERPOOL REVEALED A MILD INTEREST AND MISS WYNN WAS COMPELLED TO DEPART WITH LITTLE ENLIGHTENMENT
LONG THEY SAT UNTIL THE SILENCE CREPT INTO BLES'S FLESH AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND HE TOUCHED ZORA'S CLASPING IT
IN THE HUT NIGHT FLED WITH WILD SONG AND REVEL AND DAY DAWNED AGAIN
THE NIGHT WAS BALMY AND STILL
MCCLURG CO
BUT,"--PRESENTLY,--"HOW CAN WE SELL IT WITHOUT THE CRESSWELLS KNOWING WE WON'T TRY
HE HAD THE VOICE THE PRESENCE THE IDEAS AND ABOVE ALL HE WAS INTENSELY IN EARNEST
A SELF-MASTERY
BUT IT WAS BUILT ON A MOAN CRIED MISS SMITH TO HERSELF PASSIONATELY AND SHE WOULD NOT LOOK ROUND ANY MORE BUT STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD WHERE SHE SAW OLD COLONEL CRESSWELL SMOKING AND READING ON THE VERANDAH
THROUGH RED AND SOMBRE BROWNS PALE AND BRILLIANT YELLOWS DEAD AND LIVING BLACKS
IN TOWN MISS SMITH ROSE
ALL RIGHT HE CALLED AND IN A MOMENT WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND OUT INTO THE NIGHT
ONLY HER EYE FOLLOWED THE CROOKED LINE OF THE CRESSWELL BLUE BLOOD ON HIS MARBLE FOREHEAD AS SHE LOOKED DOWN FROM HER GREATER HEIGHT
IT'S NAUSEATING--SENSELESS
AGAIN SHE SAID MAKING HIM POINT OUT EACH WORD
IN HER WORLD THERE WAS LITTLE CALCULATION OF MONEY
BUT WOULD HE AS SUCH EVER COMMAND THE LOVE AND RESPECT OF THIS NEW AND INEXPLICABLE WOMAN
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SIT HIDDEN IN THE FOREST LISTENING AND GLIMPSING AND THINKING THINKING TILL HER HEAD WHIRLED AND THE WORLD DANCED RED BEFORE HER EYES TODAY SHE ROSE WEARILY FOR IT WAS NEAR NOON AND STARTED HOME
NINE THE PLANTING ZORA LOOKED DOWN UPON BLES WHERE HE STOOD TO HIS KNEES IN MUD
YOU ARE PLANNING TO PUT OUR PLOUGH-HANDS ALL TO STUDYING GREEK AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CORNER THE COTTON CROP--ROT JOHN TAYLOR CARESSED HIS LEAN JAW
LET'S SEE THE SUNSET IN THE SWAMP SHE SAID SUDDENLY
THERE WAS HIS FATHER TOO TO RECKON WITH
I WANT TO GET TO WORK MISS SMITH LAID A KINDLY HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
IF MAXWELL CALLS BY ABOUT THAT LUMBER TELL HIM I'LL SEE HIM IN TOWN AND AWAY HE WENT
SHE WAS NOW A PEON BOUND TO A MASTER'S BIDDING
IT BEATS STEEL COLONEL CRESSWELL CHUCKLED
A SORT OF TERROR SHOOK HIM UNTIL HE HEARD THE DISTANT SONGS OF BLACK FOLK IN THE FIELDS
IT WAS EVIDENTLY A REPORTER AND THE MAID WAS ADMITTING HIM
WHY--MISS SMITH SHE FALTERED
ALL THIS LAY IN ITS DARKNESS
HERE MISS ZORA WILL CARRY ON HER WORK AND THE SCHOOL WILL RUN A MODEL FARM WITH YOUR HELP
BUT DRIFTING MERELY--NOT ARRIVED
WHERE IS SHE IN TOOMS COUNTY ALABAMA--IN MR TAYLOR CONSULTED A REMOTE MENTAL POCKET--"IN MISS SARA SMITH'S SCHOOL WHY HOW FORTUNATE
WELL I MUST BE GOING WHAT IS--I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT APPOINTED AMBASSADORS TO BE SURE BUT WE APPOINT PRESIDENTS LAUGHED MR EASTERLY
AND WHY NOT BE HAPPY ANSWERED MRS VANDERPOOL AMUSED BAFFLED SPURRED FOR THE TIME BEING FROM HER CHRONIC ENNUI
YES EVERY DAY THEY STRAGGLED IN
YES I DESIRE IT VERY MUCH--THANK YOU YOU'LL GET AN APPOINTMENT TO-MORROW MORNING AND THE SENATOR ROSE
I'M GOING TO TROUBLE YOU TO SEE ME TO MY DOOR
THE DAMNED THIEVES THEY'SE STOLE A YEAR'S WORK--THE WHITE BUT SOME ONE CALLED HUSH UP SANDERS
I--WELL I THINK OF HER FUTURE IT'S WRONG TO TREAT HER AS YOU DO
NEARLY EVERY ONE MENTIONED A CANDIDATE AND THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEMED TO REFRAIN FROM MOTIVES OF PERSONAL MODESTY
SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH HER WIDE BLUE EYES
PERHAPS SHE WORE HER MANNERS JUST A TRIFLE CONSCIOUSLY
ELSPETH ZORA SPRANG TO HER FEET ALERT FEARFUL
BLES WAS BEWILDERED AND SILENT AND HIS GREAT UNDYING SORROW SANK ON HIS HEART WITH SICKENING HOPELESS WEIGHT
WHERE WAS NELL'S
BUT TELL ME MORE ABOUT COTTON HIS EYES LIGHTED FOR COTTON WAS TO HIM A VERY REAL AND BEAUTIFUL THING AND A LIFE-LONG COMPANION YET NOT ONE WHOSE FRIENDSHIP HAD BEEN COARSENED AND KILLED BY HEAVY TOIL
I CANNOT AFFORD A LAWYER AND I DO NOT THINK I NEED ONE CRESSWELL'S LAWYER SMILED AND LEANED BACK
BUT ROBERT FARMING DOESN'T CALL FOR LESS INTELLIGENCE THAN OTHER THINGS
MRS CRESSWELL DID NOT NOTICE HER BUT SHE PAUSED WITH A START OF RECOGNITION AT THE SIGHT OF THE MAN
SHE STILL REFUSED TO BOARD FOR THAT WOULD COST MORE THAN SHE COULD PAY YET AND SHE WOULD ACCEPT NO CHARITY
AND YET AGAIN A BROWN GIRL WITH EXACTLY MISS CRESSWELL'S AIR AND YONDER MISS WILLIAMS WITH ZORA'S WISTFUL WILLFULNESS
ONE BY ONE SHE CONSIDERED THE MEN SHE KNEW AND BY A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION FINALLY ARRIVED AT BLES ALWYN
SHE HAD DINNER PREPARED FOR COOKING IN THE YARD
BEYOND ALL THIS THE RAISING OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SATISFY THE MORTGAGE SEEMED SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE AND MISS SMITH SAT IN FATAL RESIGNATION AWAITING THE COMING DAY
CRESSWELL DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO REPLY
IT'S A WONDER I ESCAPED TOTAL RUIN
TWENTY-FIVE THE CAMPAIGN MR EASTERLY SAT IN MRS VANDERPOOL'S APARTMENTS IN THE NEW WILLARD WASHINGTON DRINKING TEA
STILL COLONEL CRESSWELL WAITED BUT ZORA WAITED NO LONGER
THEY'RE NOT RELATED I HEARD THAT MCGHEE OF ST PAUL WILL BE IN THE CITY NEXT WEEK WITH HIS DAUGHTER YES AND THE BENTLEYS OF CHICAGO BLES PASSED ON
MAMMY SHE WHISPERED--WITH BATED BREATH--"MAMMY ELSPETH OUT OF THE NIGHT CAME A WHISPERED ANSWER
IMMEDIATELY HER FACE LIGHTED AND HER LIPS PARTED BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
COLONEL CRESSWELL SAW TO BOTH MATTERS
NEVER HEARD OF IT BUT SENATOR SMITH BEGAN AND PAUSED
HE TOOK HER BAG AND CARRIED IT TOWARDS THE GATE WHICH MADE THE OBSERVERS BREATHE EASIER SEEING HIM IN SERVILE DUTY
MR TAYLOR SAID THE LAWYER CARELESSLY WERE YOU PRESENT AT THIS TRANSACTION YES DID YOU SEE COLONEL CRESSWELL SIGN THIS PAPER YES WELL DID HE INTEND SO FAR AS YOU KNOW TO SIGN SUCH A PAPER I DO NOT KNOW HIS INTENTIONS DID HE SAY HE MEANT TO SIGN SUCH A CONTRACT TAYLOR HESITATED
EVERYBODY IS GOING GOING SHE MURMURED
YOU SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THE GIFTS OF THE LORD
BUT THE SHERIFF TALKED
ISN'T THE CENSUS BUILDING WRETCHED I DO NOT KNOW SMILED MISS WYNN
MISS TAYLOR TOLD HIM
OUT OF IT SHE BROUGHT AN OLD BAG OF COTTON SEED--NOT THE WHITE-GREEN SEED WHICH BLES HAD ALWAYS KNOWN BUT SMALL SMOOTH BLACK SEEDS WHICH SHE HANDLED CAREFULLY DIPPING HER HANDS DEEP DOWN AND LETTING THEM DROP THROUGH HER GNARLED FINGERS
NOW THERE WAS MRS VANDERPOOL--SHE TOILED NOT NEITHER DID SHE SPIN AND YET
MRS VANDERPOOL GAVE IT TO ME TO USE IN HELPING THE COLORED PEOPLE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT WELL THAT'S JUST WHAT I CAME TO SEE YOU ABOUT
AT PRESENT FOUR SOUTHERN VOTES WERE NEEDED TO CONFIRM VANDERPOOL
WE RECOGNIZE THE GOOD YOU ARE DOING BUT WE DO NOT WANT IT MORE THAN OFFSET BY UTTER LACK OF DISCRIMINATION IN CHOOSING YOUR MATERIAL CERTAINLY NOT--HAVE WE MISS MARY FALTERED
TAYLOR CALLS 84 ELEVEN
BUT BACK OF IT ALL MISS SMITH SAT HALF HOPELESS
ARE YOU HAPPY RETORTED ZORA LOOKING HER OVER CAREFULLY FROM SILKEN STOCKINGS TO GARDEN HAT
NOW THE WEALTH WAS REAL COLD HARD DOLLARS AND IN PILES
FOR ME THE WOMAN QUICKLY REPLIED
I'M MANOEUVRING TO GET THE SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN INTO LINE
THE SHERIFF TURNED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE REAR
THE TREES CRASHED AND THE STUMPS GROANED AND CREPT UP INTO THE AIR THE BRAMBLES BLAZED AND SMOKED
MRS GREY BROKE IN BEAMING
SHE HAD NOT KNOWN SHE HAD SCARCELY SEEN A CHILD OF HER OWN AGE UNTIL BLES ALWYN HAD FLED FROM HER DANCING IN THE NIGHT AND SHE HAD SEARCHED AND FOUND HIM SLEEPING IN THE MISTY MORNING LIGHT
YOU SEE SENATOR SHE SAID CIVIL-SERVICE RULES ARE NOT ALWAYS IMPERVIOUS TO RACE PREJUDICE THE SENATOR FROWNED
I DON'T KNOW
SHE COMPARED HERSELF WITH HELEN CRESSWELL
RESCUE YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD--FREE YOURSELVES--FREE YOURSELVES AND FROM THE SWAYING SOBBING HUNDREDS BURST A GREAT AMEN THE MINISTER'S DUSKY FACE GREW MORE AND MORE SOMBRE AND THE ANGRY SWEAT STARTED ON HIS BROW
THEY WOULD NOT THEY COULD NOT WORK WITHOUT DRIVING
BOTH ROLES SHE LIKED
DEY HAS TO WORK MR CRESSWELL WON'T ALLOW WILL TO GO TO SCHOOL THIS TERM MR TOLLIVER DONE PUT SAM IN THE FIELD AND SO MISS SMITH CONTEMPLATED MANY EMPTY DESKS
SHE KNEW HE WOULD NOT OBJECT BUT SHE SHRANK FROM HIS RIDICULE
BUT TODAY HE MUST SPEAK ALTHOUGH TIME PRESSED
THE JUDGE AND SHERIFF WERE BOTH ELECTED BY MILL-HANDS WHO HATE CRESSWELL AND TAYLOR
WE'LL SEE THAT ON SUCH COMMITTEE YOU SOUTHERNERS GET WHAT YOU WANT--CONTROL OF NEGRO EDUCATION THAT SOUNDS FAIR
SHE HEARD THE DRESSMAKER'S VOICE AND THEN HER STEP UPON THE STAIR
FRIEND OF MINE
GIVE EM YOUR GREEK--AND STUDY COTTON
BUT DO YOU KNOW NOW I BELIEVE I PREFER IT HE LOOKED SO HORRIFIED THAT SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING
HE REALIZED THAT IN BLES AND ZORA HE WAS DEALING WITH A YOUNGER CLASS OF EDUCATED BLACK FOLK WHO WERE LEARNING TO FIGHT WITH NEW WEAPONS
SHE HELPED HERSELF TO A CHOCOLATE AND CALLED OUT MUSICALLY
HIS HOSTESS WAS SAYING RATHER CARELESSLY
THE COUPLE UNCLASPED SHAMEFACEDLY AND THE YOUNG MAN LIFTING HIS HAT STARTED TO STAMMER AN APOLOGY
SHOW HER SHE SAID
WELL AT LEAST PLENTY OF CHILDREN PLENTY BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES ASKED MRS GREY
WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICE OF ALWYN'S MANHOOD WOULD BE HER HUSBAND'S APPOINTMENT TO PARIS
BOWING COURTEOUSLY HE WAITED COLDLY AND CALMLY FOR HER TO GO
BY AND BY LOUD LAUGHTER AND TRAMPING CAME FROM THE ROAD--A SOUND OF NUMEROUS FOOTSTEPS
TO BESPEAK HIS APPRECIATION AND SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE
IT'S ALL SO PRETTY BUT IT MUST BE SO THAT WHAT'S LEFT WILL BE PRETTIER OR AT LEAST MORE USEFUL BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE SO
GET OUT
WHERE'S--NELL'S THE WOMAN FROWNED
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO WITH ALABAMA COTTON CRIED JOHN TAYLOR IN TRIUMPH
WHY--NO YOU REMEMBER I WORKED FOR MR HARRY AND SERVED YOU-ALL LUNCH ONE DAY OH YES--WHY YES
WE MUST ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT BE BOUGHT BY A FEW OFFICES THAT'S ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR YOU TO TALK TEERSWELL
YOU LIVE OVER SOUTH OF THE SWAMP YES MA'AM THAT'S ME
HELEN PURSED HER LIPS AND PETULANTLY TAPPED THE FLOOR WITH HER FOOT
SOMEWHERE WAY DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF HER NATURE THE PRIMAL TIGER AWOKE AND SNARLED
ONCE ON THE FOREMOST CAR SHE LEANED BACK AND LOOKED
BUT THERE'S THE SOUTH TO RECKON WITH
ABRUPTLY HE SAT UP AGAIN AND PEERED DOWN THE OAKS
HER HANDS FELL LIMPLY AND THE HORROR FLAMED IN HER WET EYES
HER EYES FLASHED
SIT DOWN--THERE'S A GOOD BOY I SAID
HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
NOW--ER--LET'S SEE--OH YES
HOW TO THE WANDERER THE WAY WAS OPENED
SHE WAS EDUCATED EVEN CULTURED YET SHE TAUGHT NEGROES
PARTICULARLY WAS COLONEL CRESSWELL STIRRED TO ACTION
THE FLOWERING OF THE FLEECE 99 TWELVE
THE TEASING OF HIS FELLOWS THE COMMON LOVE-GOSSIP OF THE SCHOOL YARD SEEMED FAR DIFFERENT FROM HIS PLIGHT
THE PRESENT BILL WILL LAST LONGER OR I LOSE MY GUESS--'SPECIALLY IF SMITH IS IN THE SENATE
THUS HE HESITATED KNOWING THAT HIS DUTY LAY CLEAR
HIS BUSINESS METHODS WERE SUCH AS A CRESSWELL COULD NEVER STOOP TO
THERE WAS IN HER WALKING STANDING SITTING A SIMPLE DIRECTNESS WHICH MRS VANDERPOOL SENSED AND MET
ZORA WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO WHEN YOU GROW UP ZORA CONSIDERED
THE WOMAN STAGGERED AND OFFERED HER GLASS
A RED LIVERY-STABLE FACED THEM AND ALL ABOUT THREE SIDES OF THE SQUARE RAN STORES
FORTUNATELY SAID MR VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS YES INDEED CRESSWELL AGREED
A MIGHTY QUESTIONING AROSE WITHIN A QUESTIONING AND A YEARNING
POOR CHILD!--RUNNING TO THE PENITENTIARY--TO SHAME AND HUNGER AND DAMNATION SHE REMEMBERED THE RECTOR IN MRS VANDERPOOL'S LIBRARY AND HIS QUESTION THAT REVEALED UNFATHOMABLE DEPTHS OF IGNORANCE
AT THE NORTH IN THE WHITE CHURCHES SHE ENJOYED THE BEAUTY OF WALL WINDOWS AND HYMN LIKED THE VOICE AND SURPLICE OF THE PREACHER
EDUCATED MEN OF EARNESTNESS AND ABILITY MIGHT STEM THE TIDE
LET'S SEE
THE ANNUNCIATION 263 TWENTY-NINE
THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
BUT--I DON'T UNDERSTAND MISS SMITH--WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT MY OFFER BECAUSE YOU ASK ME TO PUT MY SCHOOL IN CONTROL OF THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF BLACK FOLK AND IN PARTICULAR I OBJECT TO MR CRESSWELL SAID MISS SMITH SLOWLY BUT VERY DISTINCTLY BECAUSE HIS RELATION TO THE FORCES OF EVIL IN THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SUCH THAT HE CAN DIRECT NO SCHOOL OF MINE MRS VANDERPOOL MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR AND MR CRESSWELL BOWING SLIGHTLY FOLLOWED
ALSO THE BILL REORGANIZING THE SCHOOL BOARD HAD PASSED
HE WAS GLAD TO FIND MRS CRESSWELL THERE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME--DOES YOU MRS CRESSWELL SAID STILLINGS
SO THERE WE ARE
MARY CRESSWELL SPED HER DEPARTING GUESTS WITH A DISTINCT PURPOSE IN MIND
CRUSHED HALF-SPIRITED AND BLIND
THREE MEN THREW UP THEIR HANDS AND TUMBLED LIMPLY IN THE DUST WHILE THE MAIN BODY RUSHED PELLMELL TOWARD TOWN
WE'LL SEE THAT SMITH DOES WHAT CRESSWELL WANTS BUT TAYLOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
AS MRS VANDERPOOL COULD THINK OF NOTHING LESS BORING SHE CONSENTED TO DINE
OF COURSE ANSWERED CRESSWELL
FOURTEEN LOVE THE RAIN WAS SWEEPING DOWN IN GREAT THICK WINDING SHEETS
HAVE A SISTER WHO IS--ER--DEVOTING HERSELF TO TEACHING THEM HE SAID
NOT SIMPLY TO MR EASTERLY BUT IN A SENSE TO HIS SPIRITUAL HEIR JOHN TAYLOR
PALE FLUSHED AND BRILLIANT IN SILKEN RAGS
WILFULLY SHE DEPARTED FROM THE SET PATTERN AND SEWED INTO THE CLOTH SOMETHING OF THE BEAUTY IN HER HEART
THERE WERE CARELESSLY GOWNED WOMEN AND MEN SMART AND SHABBY BUT NONE OF THEM WERE THINKING OF CLOTHES NOR EVEN OF ONE ANOTHER
JUST THEN MRS GREY DROVE UP IN HER NEW RED MOTOR
YOU HAVE COME HERE TO SPEAK TO ME OF THAT--THAT SHE CHOKED AND BLES THOUGHT HIS WORST FEARS REALIZED
HIT'S HOT AIN'T IT
NOT SORROW FOR HERSELF FOR OF THAT SHE HAD TASTED THE UTTERMOST
SHE ALL AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD--PERHAPS READ THE RIDDLE IN THE DARK MELANCHOLY EYES THAT SO STEADILY REGARDED HER
HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE--HIS AND ZORA'S--MUST BE RUINED
IT SET HIS HEAD IN A WHIRL
THE TWENTY ACRES OF CLEARED SWAMP LAND ATTENDED TO BY THE VOLUNTARY LABOR OF ALL THE TENANTS WAS SOON BEARING A MAGNIFICENT CROP
BLES LOOKED UP AND SAW THE BLEEDING HANDS
MECHANICALLY HE SEARCHED FOR HIS MAIL AND UNDID THE LATEST NUMBER OF THE COLORED AMERICAN
HE COULD HEAR THE WHISTLE OF BIRDS AND THE SOBBING OF THE BREEZE IN THE SHADOWING OAKS
HE FELT VERY DISTINCTLY THAT MRS VANDERPOOL WAS NOT PARTICULARLY DESIROUS OF HIS COMPANY NOR THAT OF HIS FAMILY
FORM A BIG COMMITTEE OF NORTHERN BUSINESS MEN LIKE YOURSELF--PHILANTHROPISTS LIKE VANDERPOOL AND SOUTHERNERS LIKE CRESSWELL
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOU HE SAID AFTER A SILENCE
COLONEL CRESSWELL STARED AT THEM AND ZORA INSTINCTIVELY PUT UP HER HAND AND FASTENED HER DRESS AT THE THROAT
A STRANGE STARTLING THOUGHT FLASHED THROUGH HER BRAIN
A THOUSAND THINGS HE HAD FORGOTTEN SURGED SUDDENLY TO LIFE
SHE STOOD LOOKING AT THE CLOSED DOOR A MOMENT
WELL YOU WATCH THE FARMERS LEAGUE AND NOTE ITS SUCCESS AND METHODS COUNSELLED JOHN TAYLOR HIS TONE AND MANNER UNCHANGED
WHY NOT BRING THEM INTO THE TRUST POSSIBLY LATER
SHE BOUGHT A FEW TRIFLES AND THEN APPROACHED HER MAIN BUSINESS
SHE HAD HER STREAK OF THRIFT AND WANTED HER BUSINESS CAPACITY RECOGNIZED
WE'VE GOT NO CONTRACT WITH THE WENCH SO DON'T DALLY WITH HER BUT HARRY SAID FIRMLY QUIETLY
YET HERE HIS ZORA,--HIS POOR DISAPPOINTED CHILD--WAS IMPRISONED
THE SOUTH HAS DISFRANCHISED NEGROES AND LYNCHED A FEW
OH I MEANT GREAT ACTIVE CITIES AND BUILDINGS MYRIADS OF PEOPLE AND WONDERFUL SIGHTS YES--BUT BACK OF IT ALL WHAT IS IT REALLY
COTTON FELL TO SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS AND THE MUTTERED PROTEST BECAME ANGRY DENUNCIATION
THE GIRL'S LANGUAGE CAME TO BE MORE AND MORE LIKE MRS VANDERPOOL'S
IT MIGHT BE WISE TO ENLIST THEM
BUT IF NOT
THEN SHE ANSWERED THE QUERY HERSELF
THE MILL DIRECTORS MEET TODAY
SHE WAS AS MRS CRESSWELL NOTICED A YOUNG WOMAN ONCE PRETTY PERHAPS AND A LITTLE OVER-DRESSED
HE INQUIRED CAREFULLY INTO THE CASE AND EXAMINED THE PAPERS
IT SEEMED TO DEVOUR CHILDREN SITTING WITH ITS MYRIAD EYES GLEAMING AND ITS BLACK MAW OPEN DRAWING IN THE PALE WHITE MITES SUCKING THEIR BLOOD AND SPEWING THEM OUT PALER AND EVER PALER
HE THOUGHT OF THAT FIRST RED NIGHT AND THE YELLING AND SINGING AND WILD DANCING
THE IDIOMS AND ERRORS WERE DROPPING AWAY
WITHOUT A WORD UNCLE ISAAC SANK UPON THE FLOOR AND LAY STILL
IMPULSIVELY SHE MOVED FORWARD WITH HANDS THAT WANTED TO STRETCH THEMSELVES IN APPEAL
HER SMALL FEET AND SLENDER ANKLES WERE BLACK AND BARE
WHY HE CHALLENGED STURDILY
AND THEN--THEN I RECKON I'D HAVE GONE BACK AND BEEN--AS THEY ALL ARE--BUT YOU CAME BLES--YOU CAME AND YOU--YOU WERE A NEW GREAT THING IN MY LIFE AND--AND--YET I WAS AFRAID I WAS NOT WORTHY UNTIL YOU--YOU SAID THE WORDS
ALL THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL TO MRS GREY AND UNUSUALLY INTERESTING TO MRS VANDERPOOL
OH NO NO,--BUT TO ADVERTISE JUST NOW A BIG SCHEME OF NEGRO EDUCATION WOULD DRIVE THE CRESSWELLS THE FARMERS LEAGUE AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS SOUTH DEAD AGAINST US
BUT I'LL BE SO NEAR HE EXPLAINED
THEN AT LAST ONE HALF-GROWN BOY HURRIED BY
REALLY MR EASTERLY I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT SUCH MATTERS AND CARE LESS
PSHAW
ALL THE MORE REASON FOR MOLLIFYING HIM
SHE EXPECTS SOME PAPERS OR RECEIPTS WELL IT'S TOO LATE TONIGHT POSSIBLY YOU COULD SIGN A SORT OF RECEIPT AND LATER CRESSWELL LAUGHED
SHE AWOKE WITH A START IN HER OWN BED
SOMEHOW THE OLD DREAM-LIFE WITH ITS GLORIOUS PHANTASIES HAD COME SILENTLY BACK RICHER AND SWEETER THAN EVER
WHAT'S THE USE IT SEEMED TO HER THAT EVERY BREEZE AND BRANCH WAS INSTINCT WITH SYMPATHY AND MURMURING WHAT'S THE USE SHE WONDERED VAGUELY WHY AND AS SHE WONDERED SHE KNEW
YOU SEE I'M NOT USED TO HEARING SUCH SINGING MR TEERSWELL COMPELLED TO LISTEN LAUGHED DRILY
THEY TOO WERE HUMAN
BETTER GO EASY AND SUGGEST A WAITING-GAME BEFORE SHE GOES IN HEAVY BUT MISS SMITH NEEDS MONEY THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE PROMPTED
CHOOSE THEN WHITE OR BLACK
THOUGHT YOU WERE HOEING COTTON BLES LAUGHED AND CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD
SHE WAS THINKING RAPIDLY--WAS THIS THE WAY
HOW MUCH HAD MRS CRESSWELL EVER KNOWN OF ZORA
I THINK I AM READY TO GO SHE GASPED
WHITE CURTAINS ADORNED IT AND WHITE HANGINGS DRAPED THE PLAIN BUREAU AND WASH-STAND AND THE LITTLE BED
A MOMENT SHE LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR THEN OPENED IT SLIGHTLY
FURTHER ON THEY OVERTOOK A TALL YOUNG YELLOW BOY WALKING AWKWARDLY BESIDE A HANDSOME BOLD-FACED GIRL
ZORA SAT STROKING THE LINED HANDS
SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN QUICK BREATHLESS FEAR
FROM THE OTHER SIDE THE WORDS CAME DISTINCTLY AND CLEARLY
SHE WAS TO MAKE HER LIFE AN ENDLESS SACRIFICE
THERE IT WAS COLORED HIGH SCHOOLS CLOSE--VICIOUS ATTACK ON REPUBLICAN PARTY BY NEGRO ORATOR SHE LAID THE PAPER ASIDE AND SLOWLY FINISHED HER COFFEE
GUESS I'LL TURN IN MARY CRESSWELL TURNED TO SEE HER HUSBAND AND HIS COMPANIONS ASCENDING THE STEPS OF THE QUIET MANSION
BUT CRESSWELL INTERRUPTED HIM
MEN AND WOMEN MUST EXERCISE JUDGMENT IN THEIR INTERCOURSE AND"--SHE GLANCED SHARPLY AT MISS TAYLOR--"MY DEAR YOU YOURSELF MUST NOT FORGET THAT BLES ALWYN IS A MAN FAR UP THE ROAD CAME A LOW LONG MUSICAL SHOUTING
I HOPE JOHN'S WELL THE TRUTH IS CONFESSED CRESSWELL IT WAS A BUSINESS MATTER--COTTON YOU KNOW JOHN IS NOTHING BUT COTTON
THEN BLES SAT UP AND STARED POLITELY BUT STEADILY BACK
SHE'S HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SOUTHERNERS ALL RIGHT
THERE WAS SOME COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MUCH MAIL BUT MARY WAS ADMITTED TO KNOWLEDGE OF NONE OF THESE
SHE WOULD NEVER BE ATTUNED TO IT THOROUGHLY FOR SHE WAS SET FOR DIFFERENT MUSIC
TAKE HER IF YOU CAN GET HER--IT IS I FEAR HER ONLY CHANCE
NOW THEY STUMBLED ON HIDDEN ROOTS
THEN SHE SAT UP RESOLUTELY AND TURNED TO THE BOOK
HER DARK EYES WERE FULL UPON HIM AND HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEIR DEPTHS THAT BROUGHT HIM TO HIMSELF AND MADE HIM REALIZE HIS BLUNDER
DOING SO WAS NOT PLEASANT BUT IT APPEALED TO HER CYNICISM AND MOCKING SENSE OF PLEASURE
BUT--BUT YOU SEE--IT HURTS SO I KNOW IT HURTS DEAR
FOR THANKS TO YOUR POLITICAL ACTIVITY MY OWN POSITION IS GONE BUT HE'S A--A DAMNED RASCAL WOUNDED SELF-CONCEIT WAS NOW GETTING THE UPPER HAND
THEN SLOWLY AND SILENTLY THE MASS OF WOMEN AND MEN WERE SUCKED INTO THE STREETS OF THE TOWN LEAVING BUT BLACK EDDIES ON THE CORNERS TO THROW BACKWARD GLANCES TOWARD THE BARE TOWERING PINE WHERE SWUNG TWO RED AND AWFUL THINGS
AND YOU GRADUATED I SUPPOSE AND ALL THAT NO BLESS ADMITTED A LITTLE SADLY AS HE TOLD OF HIS COMING NORTH AND OF SENATOR SMITH'S INFLUENCE
HE ENTERED WITH A SIGH
FOR THE WEDDING-DRESS THE EXPLANATION ACCOMPANIED THE PACKAGE THAT MARY TAYLOR HAD A SIMILAR PIECE IN THE NORTH
FIVE THOUSAND WAS NEEDED FOR THE LAND AND AT LEAST ANOTHER THOUSAND FOR REPAIRS
WHY--WHY THE IDEA SHE SPUTTERED
SHE FELT OUT OF THE WORLD SHUT IN AND MENTALLY ANAEMIC
THE HAND ON HIS ARM WAS NOT SO SMALL
IT LEFT HIM SHORN POWERLESS AND IN MORAL REVOLT
AND THEN TOO AFTER HE MENTIONED--MR ALWYN'S NAME I WANTED TO HEAR
HIS ENTRANCE WAS A BREEZE AND A ROAR
MISS WYNN HAD KEPT A VIGIL ALMOST AS LONG
THERE WERE BUSINESS REASONS ARISING FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE FALL JOHN TAYLOR HAD TELEGRAPHED
HE ARGUED TO HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS ABSURD AND YET HE KNEW THAT HE WAS LONGING FOR HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP
YES SIR HE ANSWERED AND THEY FELL TO TALKING
BUT HE SAW AND REALIZED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A PANG--SOMETHING HAD GONE
NOW MR CRESSWELL THE THING IS IN YOUR HANDS
BUT MARY TAYLOR PROCEEDED AROUND HER CIRCUMSCRIBED CIRCLE
A YOUNG BOYISH FELLOW GOLDEN-FACED AND CURLY STOOD WITH CLENCHED FISTS WHILE A WOMAN WITH TEAR-STAINED EYES CLUNG TO HIM
HE GAVE HER ONE OF HIS RARE SWEET SMILES AND RISING BEFORE SHE REALIZED HIS INTENT HE HAD KISSED HER HANDS AND WAS GONE
TWENTY THE WEAVING OF THE SILVER FLEECE THE SILVER FLEECE DARKLY CLOAKED AND GIRDED LAY IN THE COTTON WAREHOUSE OF THE CRESSWELLS NEAR THE STORE
THE MATTER SEEMED TOO DELICATE AND SACRED AND HE ALWAYS HAD AN AWFUL DREAD LEST SOMETIME SOMEWHERE A CHANCE AND FATAL WORD WOULD BE DROPPED A BREATH OF EVIL GOSSIP WHICH WOULD SHATTER ALL
FROM AN AMUSING PASTIME SHE HAD COME TO BE A COMPANION AND THOUGHT-MATE
THEY'RE ALL THAT WAY MISS TAYLOR LOOKED UP A LITTLE PUZZLED AND BECAME AWARE OF A BATTERY OF EYES AND EARS
IF HE BALKS RAISE TO FIFTY DOLLARS BUT NO MORE THEY SUMMONED THE YOUNG MAN
YOU KNOW ME
ZORA HOWEVER LEAPT TO HER FEET AND FLED INTO THE NIGHT WHILE THE HAG SCREAMED AFTER HER AND CURSED
THE ROOM WAS MOST INTERESTING FURNISHED IN UNIMPEACHABLE TASTE
BUT THAT WILL COST MONEY RESPONDED EACH OF THE DOZEN BIG LANDLORDS WHO COMPOSED THE COMMITTEE
HELEN WAS IN RAPTURES BUT HER CONSCIENCE PRICKED HER
SHE WAS SEARCHING FOR THE WAY GROPING FOR THE THREADS OF LIFE SEEKING ALMOST WILDLY TO UNDERSTAND THE FOUNDATIONS OF UNDERSTANDING PITEOUSLY ASKING FOR ANSWER TO THE PUZZLE OF LIFE
HE HAD REGARDED TAYLOR HITHERTO AS A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO THE BUSINESS--HAD RELIED ON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ROUTINE HIS JUDGMENT AND HIS HONESTY
THE SORROW IN HER HEART WAS NEW AND STRANGE
THEN CAME THE LONG DRONE AND SING-SONG OF THE PREACHER WITH ITS SHARP WILDER CLIMAXES AND THE ANSWERING AMENS AND SCREAMS OF THE WORSHIPPERS
IN THE MORNING THE PARTY WOULD COME
WE JUST WILL GET IT DONE--SOMETIME HIS MOUTH CLOSED WITH DETERMINATION
MISS WYNN READ THE LETTER AFTER ALWYN'S DEPARTURE WITH A DISTINCT THRILL WHICH WAS SOMETHING OF A LUXURY FOR HER
THIS COLORED WOMAN WAS DOUBTLESS SOME POOR DESERVING CREATURE
THE CRISIS SEEMED DRAWING NEAR
AFTER HIS FIRST START OF SURPRISE AT SEEING HER AT THE TABLE CRESSWELL UTTERED NOTHING IMMEDIATELY SAVE THE COMMONPLACES OF GREETING
DID HIS ARISTOCRATIC AIR PREVENT HIS SUCCUMBING TO THE LURE OF MILLIONS AND PROMISING THE INFLUENCE OF HIS FATHER AND THE WHOLE FARMER'S LEAGUE TO THE NEW PROJECT
SHE STILL RAN AND ROMPED IN THE WOODS AND DREAMED HER DREAMS
THEN AN IDEA OCCURRING TO HER SHE CONDUCTED THE CONVERSATION BY DEVIOUS PATHS TO TIES AND ASKED ALWYN IF HE HAD HEARD OF THE FAD OF COLLECTING TIES
THEY RUIN OUR WOMEN AND DEBAUCH OUR CHILDREN--WHAT SHALL WE DO
SHE ESPECIALLY TRIED IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF OPENING SCHOOL TO GLEAN AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE CONCERNING THE COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY THE CRESSWELLS
BUT HIS WORDS HAD NO REFERENCE TO ANYTHING IN WHICH SHE WAS INTERESTED
NO OF COURSE YOU COULD NOT
SHE HAD BROUGHT THIS RICH AND RARE-APPARELLED LADY UP HERE YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT WAS MORE PRIVATE AND HERE SHE HAD POURED FORTH HER NEEDS
TO HER INTENSE SATISFACTION IT WAS FAR MORE THAN THIS
THE GOLDEN GREEN OF THE FIRST LEAVES DARKENED AND THE PLANTS SPRANG FORWARD STEADILY
BUT REALLY THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO SAY OR TO LOOK AT
BUT HE ANSWERED FRANKLY
ONCE I WAS
SHE BELIEVED THEY SHOULD BE SERVANTS AND FARMERS CONTENT TO WORK UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS UNTIL THOSE CONDITIONS COULD BE CHANGED
I AM MISS TAYLOR I CANNOT SHARE MISS TAYLOR'S SORROW RETURNED MR CRESSWELL GRAVELY FOR I BELIEVE I HAVE THE HONOR OF SOME CORRESPONDENCE WITH MISS TAYLOR'S BROTHER MR CRESSWELL SEARCHED FOR THE LETTER BUT DID NOT FIND IT
BUT SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COTTON AND LAND WERE AT STAKE
COME TO JESUS
THERE WAS LITTLE SHE KNEW OF HER DUTIES BUT LITTLE TOO THAT SHE COULD NOT LEARN WITH A DEFTNESS AND DIVINATION ALMOST STARTLING
WE MAY LAND HIM HE REPEATED
AND NOW HE SAID MISS WYNN WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SHE LOOKED AT HIM
SHE THOUGHT OF THE GOLDEN SHEEN OF THE COTTON AND THE COLD MARCH WINDS OF NEW ENGLAND
THE PROGRAMME ATTRACTED MISS TAYLOR
THE VEIL HUNG THICK SOMBRE IMPENETRABLE
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HE ASSERTED
IN SILENCE THEY RODE ON
I LOVE NIGHT HER EYES GREW SOFT
HE SAID SOMETHING IN A LOW TONE TO ZORA AND DROVE AWAY FROWNING
THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH IS IT
GO WAY HONEY YO LOS YO TAS'E THE DRESS WAS PLAIN AND FITTED EVERY CURVING OF A HEALTHY GIRLISH FORM
SHE MUST BE TRUE
CAN YOU NOT STOP AND SEE SOME OF THE CLASSES SARAH SMITH KNEW IN HER HEART THAT THE VISIT WAS A FAILURE STILL SHE WOULD DO HER PART TO THE END
STILL I INSIST
A WILD FEAR STRUGGLED WITH HIS ANGER BUT HE KEPT REPEATING NO NO AND THEN AT ANY RATE SHE WILL TELL ME THE TRUTH SHE HAD NEVER LIED TO HIM
HE FORGOT EVERYTHING BUT THE FIELD OF THE SILVER FLEECE
HE HAD A WOMAN'S PREMONITIONS IN FULFILLING HER WISHES
ON THE WAY SHE MET THE OLD WOMAN IN THE PATH BUT GOT LITTLE SATISFACTION
WHO'S THAT ASKED THE COLONEL SHADING HIS EYES
THEN WITHOUT A WORD SHE SLIPPED DOWN-STAIRS GLIDED INTO THE SWAMP AND SPED AWAY TO THE ISLAND
BUT EVER THE GROUND LAY AN UNRELIEVED BLACK BENEATH THE BRIGHT SUN AND THEY WOULD GO RELUCTANTLY HOME AGAIN TODAY THERE WAS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE AND ZORA LABORED STEADILY AND EAGERLY NEVER PAUSING AND GAINING IN DEFTNESS AND CARE
WE SHALL SELL A FEW TWENTY-ACRE FARMS BUT KEEP ONE CENTRAL PLANTATION OF ONE HUNDRED ACRES FOR THE SCHOOL
IN THE RICH WALL STREET OFFICES OF GREY AND EASTERLY BROKERS MR TAYLOR AS CHIEF AND CONFIDENTIAL CLERK SURVEYED THE WORLD'S NAKEDNESS AND THE SUPPLY OF COTTON TO CLOTHE IT
BUT SHE GLANCED WESTWARD AND THE FIERCE LOOK FADED
ZORA LOOKED BACK AT HIM AND THE PARAMOUNT MISSION OF HER LIFE FORMED ITSELF IN HER MIND
BUT THE WORLD DOES
HER HUSBAND IS MR STILLINGS REGISTER OF THE TREASURY MRS CRESSWELL SAW LIGHT AS SHE TURNED TO GO DOWN THE STEPS
AMID A SILENCE SHE SAW IN THE LITTLE GROVE THAT STILL STOOD THE CABIN OF ELSPETH TREMBLE SIGH AND DISAPPEAR AND WITH IT FLEW SOME SPIRIT OF EVIL
THE GIRL HOWEVER WAS OBVIOUSLY IMPRESSED AND PLEASED BY HIS EVIDENCE OF INTEREST WHATEVER ITS NATURE
SOFT JOY CREPT TO HER FACE AGAIN AND SHE SAT ONCE MORE DREAMING
ONE TENSE MOMENT PULSED THROUGH ALL THE SWAMP
NOW ABOUT THE NIGGERS THE CHAIRMAN HAD ASKED
SHE SAW THE SCULPTURED GLORIES OF PHIDIAS MARBLED AMID THE SPLENDOR OF THE SWAMP
COTTON WAS CURRENCY
HE NOTICED IT BUT WENT ON
THE PRICE HE HAD PAID WAS HIGH
MEANTIME THE NEGRO MUST STRENGTHEN HIMSELF AND BRING TO THE ALLIANCE AS MUCH INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC STRENGTH AS POSSIBLE
AND THEN--MY GOD
TOWARD NIGHT A DUMB DESPAIR SETTLED UPON HER
THEY WOULD REST
THE COLONEL GLANCED OVER IT CARELESSLY THEN MOVED AWAY
THERE WAS LESS OF COMRADESHIP BUT THE LITTLE MEANT MORE
I MAY CONVERT
HER BENT AND UNTRAINED BACK PAINED AND THE SOFT LITTLE HANDS BLED
AT LAST HE DREW A LONG BREATH REMARKING INDEFINITELY
HE WAS GROWING DOUBTFUL OF HIS OWN ESTIMATE OF WOMEN
SHE HAD THE FORM AND CARRIAGE
WE WERE TOO CAREFUL TO ALLOW THAT
I SAW HIM ON THE LAWN THERE WAS A SUSPICIOUS LACK OF WARMTH IN THIS BRIEF AFFIRMATION
THIS IS THE TALE OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM AND HOW THIS MIGHTY GOVERNMENT GETS RID OF BLACK MEN WHO KNOW TOO MUCH BUT BLES TRIED TO PROTEST
WHOSE IS THAT HE DEMANDED APPREHENSIVELY
PERHAPS THE SECRET NEWSPAPER WORK THE PERSONAL ADVICE OF EMPLOYERS AND FRIENDS AND THE LIBERAL DISTRIBUTION OF CASH WOULD HAVE DELIVERED A LARGE PART OF THE NEGRO VOTE TO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE
AND YET IN HER HEART LAY THE AWFUL DOUBT--AND THE WORDS KEPT RINGING IN HER EARS
ONLY IN A WHOLE WORLD OF SELVES INFINITE ENDLESS ETERNAL WORLD ON WORLDS OF SELVES--ONLY IN THEIR VAST GOOD IS TRUE SALVATION
NOW HERE STILLINGS WENT ON YOU STOW ALL THAT JEALOUSY AND HEAVY TRAGEDY
COLTON WAS SUSPICIOUS
YES NO HE PRESSED HER WITH YOUR BARGAIN WHAT BARGAIN SHE PARRIED
DR BOLDISH POINTED OUT THE LOAFERS AT THE STATIONS ESPECIALLY THE BLACK ONES
ALL AT ONCE THE SWAMP CHANGED AND CHILLED TO A DULL GRAYNESS
NEVERTHELESS THE TWO WERE USUALLY SEEN IN PUBLIC TOGETHER AND ALTHOUGH SHE OFTEN SHOWED HER QUIET MASTERY OF THE SITUATION SELDOM HAD SHE SNUBBED HIM SO OPENLY AS AT THE TREBLE CLEF CONCERT
BLES DARKENED PAINFULLY REALIZING THAT THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN JUST BEHIND HIM
SHE FACED HIM AND HE FLINCHED AS FROM SOME DESCENDING BLOW
SOME WERE STAGGERING OTHERS CURSING AND YET OTHERS SINGING
WE'VE GOT THINGS IN OUR HANDS
IT WAS A SINGLE LOW BLACK ROOM SMOKE-SHADOWED AND DIRTY WITH TWO DINGY BEDS AND A GAPING FIRE-PLACE
FROM THAT DAY ON THEY WALKED TOGETHER IN A NEW WORLD
IT WILL BE A FINE ADVERTISEMENT OF OUR PLANTATION AND EVIDENTLY HE HAS A SURPRISE IN STORE FOR US THE COLONEL AFFECTED TO HESITATE BUT NEXT MORNING THE SILVER FLEECE WENT TO TOWN
YOUR RENT AND RATIONS WITH THE FIVE YEARS BACK DEBT,"--HE MADE A HASTY CALCULATION--"WILL BE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
YES--YES HE SAID WITH UNCOMFORTABLE HASTE
ZORA CAME QUICKLY TO THE SCHOOL AND ASKED FOR ALWYN
A PITY SURGED IN HIS HEART
FROM THESE SOUTHERNERS YES FROM THEM
FOR THIS REASON I'VE HUNTED YOU UP
THE STATE OF THE ROADS
YOU WILL NOT USE THE WORLD AS IT IS BUT INSIST ON ACTING AS IF IT WERE SOMETHING ELSE I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WELL THERE IS THE WIFE OF MY JUDGE
GOOD-DAY
THE PAPERS WERE SILENT
IN A MOMENT BLES FELT THE SUBTLE ANTAGONISM OF THE GROUP
NOW MY IDEAL IS A SET OF NEGRO SCHOOLS WHERE THE WHITE TEACHERS COULD KNOW THE CRESSWELLS WHY YES FALTERED MISS TAYLOR
TO RISE WHEN HE WOULD EAT WHAT HE CRAVED AND DO WHAT THE PASSING FANCY SUGGESTED HAD LONG BEEN HIS DAY'S PROGRAMME
THE WORLD THE GREAT MYSTERIOUS WORLD THAT STRETCHED BEYOND THE SWAMP AND INTO WHICH BLES AND THE SILVER FLEECE HAD GONE--DID IT LEAD TO THE WAY
YOU MEAN YOU CAN PAY WHAT WE ASK WHY YES
TAYLOR COULD NOT SEE ANY GREAT DANGER
HELEN HAD ALL A CHILD'S NAIVE LOVE FOR BEAUTIFUL AND DAINTY THINGS AND A WEDDING-GOWN FROM PARIS HAD BEEN HER LIFE DREAM
IN ONE SENSE IT'S GOOD ADVICE HE ADMITTED
HE INTENDED TO HAVE A WIFE LIKE THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS
WE'LL CONSIDER THIS MATTER CAREFULLY
SAY THAT'S A GOOD POINT
IF HE COULD BUT LET GO THE ELEMENTAL PASSIONS THAT WERE LEAPING AND GATHERING AND BURNING IN THE EYES OF YONDER CAGED AND DESPERATE BLACK MEN
GREAT AS THE NEGRO PROBLEM MIGHT BE AS A WORLD PROBLEM IT LOOKED SORDID AND SMALL AT CLOSE RANGE
SHE REVIEWED HER CONDUCT
THANKS TO HIS WIFE THE SPEECH WAS UNUSUALLY INFORMING AND WELL PUT AND THE FACT THAT A PROMINENT FREE-TRADER SPOKE THE SAME AFTERNOON GAVE IT PUBLICITY WHILE MR EASTERLY SAW TO THE PRESS DESPATCHES
PARTICULARLY WE MUST GET THEM INTO LINE TO OFFSET TODD'S FOOLISHNESS
WE WANT TO KEEP THIS HUNDRED ACRES FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND NOT SELL IT
I FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT MRS VANDERPOOL
AND THERE'S LITTLE FAIRIES THERE THAT HOP ABOUT AND SING AND DEVILS--GREAT UGLY DEVILS THAT GRABS AT YOU AND ROASTS AND EATS YOU IF THEY GITS YOU
NEW YORK CITY AUGUST 15 1911 THE AUTHOR ONE DREAMS NIGHT FELL
SHE WAS A LADY YET SHE WAS BLACK--THAT IS BROWN
MARY--MARY
THE BRETHREN IS A-GETTIN MIGHTY ONPATIENT TO HEAR ME HE PULLED DOWN HIS CUFFS REGARDING HER DOUBTFULLY
NO HOPE
SOMEWAY SHE KNEW NOT JUST HOW SHE FOUND HERSELF TELLING HIM OF THE CRISIS IN HER LIFE BEFORE SHE REALIZED
DEEP WITHIN HER SHE DISCOVERED AT TIMES A PASSIONATE LONGING TO BELIEVE IN SOMEBODY
HE HAD BEEN TOO LONG UNTETHERED
HER FACE LOOKED SMALLER AND HER MASSES OF HAIR BROUGHT LOW ABOUT HER EARS HEIGHTENED HER GHOSTLY BEAUTY
HE CAME DOWN TO HER SLOWLY WITH FIXED HUNGRY EYES THREADING HIS WAY AMID THE FLEECE
IT IS ALL RIGHT--ALL RIGHT BUT MORE AND MORE ABOVE THE DOUBT AND BEYOND THE UNREST ROSE THE GREAT END THE MIGHTY IDEAL THAT FLICKERED AND WAVERED BUT EVER GREW AND WAXED STRONG UNTIL IT BECAME POSSIBLE AND THROUGH IT ALL THINGS ELSE WERE POSSIBLE
ZORA KNEW HIS INTENTION
DAMN IT
HIS EYES WERE BLOOD-SHOT HIS CHEEKS SUNKEN AND HIS BREATH CAME IN PAINFUL GASPS
ZORA WAS SILENT AT FIRST
HE HAD BOUGHT HER IN TOWN AT CHRISTMAS TIME A PAIR OF WHITE SATIN SLIPPERS PARTLY TO TEST THE SMALLNESS OF HER FEET ON WHICH IN YOUNGER DAYS HE HAD RALLIED HER AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE HAD MENTIONED A POSSIBLE WHITE DRESS
NOW SAID ALWYN WE WOULD BEST SELL WHILE PRICES ARE HIGH ZORA LAUGHED AT HIM FRANKLY
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN ALWYN INTENDS TO MARRY MISS WYNN YOU LIE THE OTHER SUDDENLY YELLED WITH AN OATH OVERTURNING HIS TUMBLER AND STRIDING ACROSS THE FLOOR
SHE HAD A REAL TALENT FOR SCULPTURE AND HAD STUDIED CONSIDERABLY
SHE TRIED TO THINK IT OUT
AND THEN AS HE CAME CASTING IT SUDDENLY TO THE WINDS IN TEARS AND LAUGHTER SHE SWAYED AND DROPPED QUIVERING IN HIS ARMS
I MIGHT ROT HERE FOR ALL SHE CARES
WE MAY HAVE TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AND A FEW MORE MINOR OFFICES THAN USUAL
MARY CRESSWELL STOOD FROZEN
THE SHARPNESS OF MISS SMITH'S JOY DID NOT LET HER DWELL ON THE PROPOSED BOARD OF TRUST
MY TRANSOM WAS OPEN
SHE HASN'T LEARNED ANYTHING IN TWENTY YEARS BUT SURELY YOU DIDN'T JOIN HER IN ADVOCATING THAT TEN MILLION PEOPLE BE MENIALS OH NO
ONE CAUGHT HIS EYE
THE VOICES GREW FAINTER AND FAINTER--ALL THE WORLD RECEDED SUDDENLY FAR AWAY
IT IS THE BEST LAND IN THE COUNTY WHEN IT'S CL'ARED INTERRUPTED JOHNSON AND SIMPSON LOOKED ALARMED
THE TALK CAME AROUND TO THE FAILURE OF THE SENATE TO CONFIRM MR VANDERPOOL AND IT WAS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD NOT FORCE THE ISSUE
ALL THIS CAROLINE WYNN THOUGHT OF AND THEN SMILED
MRS CRESSWELL WAITING FOR HIM WAS ALMOST PANIC-STRICKEN
YOU SEE I SPEAK FRANKLY I CAN STAND IT SENATOR I BELIEVE YOU CAN
THE TALL PINES LOST THEIR SLIMNESS AND STOOD IN WIDE BLURRED BLOTCHES ALL ACROSS THE WAY AND A GREAT SHADOWY BIRD AROSE WHEELED AND MELTED MURMURING INTO THE BLACK-GREEN SKY
AND SUPPOSE I HAD BLES THREW OUT HIS ARMS HELPLESSLY
LONG SHE HAD WRESTLED WITH THEM AS THEY TWISTED AND TURNED AND KNOTTED THEMSELVES AND SHE WORKED AND TOILED SO HARD AS SHE LAY THERE TO MAKE THE THING CLEAR--TO UNDERSTAND
IT SEEMED SENSELESS AND UNREASONABLE AND YET SO STRANGELY SO THAT SHE WAS AT A LOSS TO ASK QUESTIONS
YOU SAW WHAT HE DID TO ME AND I'M WARNING YOU IN TIME COLTON'S GLASS DROPPED
ALL THE ROADS IN THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN LINED WITH WAGONS--A MILLION WAGONS SPEEDING TO AND FRO WITH STRAINING MULES AND LAUGHING BLACK MEN BEARING BUBBLING MASSES OF PILED WHITE FLEECE
BUT LET'S THINK IT OUT
THEN HER NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE STEPPED IN
BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN
TO MARY TAYLOR IT HAD THE FASCINATION OF A PUZZLE WHOSE OTHER SIDE SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN PARTIALLY STUDYING
SHE FELT A SORT OF PERSON PROPRIETORSHIP IN HER AND WHEN AT LAST THE QUICKENED PULSE DIED TO ITS REGULAR HEALTHY BEAT SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AND KNEW
THEN IF YOU WILL USE YOUR INFLUENCE FOR THE PART WITH THE SOUTHERNERS I CAN CONFIDENTLY PREDICT FROM FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS SOJOURN IN PARIS MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED AND CALLED HER MAID AS MR EASTERLY WENT
THE WENCH DON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH ANYHOW
HE'S SECRETLY ENCOURAGING AND HELPING THEM
DON'T YOU WANT TO COME UP AND HELP ME LOOK THEY WENT UP TO THE CLEAN BARE ROOM WITH ITS WHITE IRON BED ITS COOL SPOTLESS SHADES AND SHINING WINDOWS
BUT HE HESITATED
BLES SHOWED HIS LIST OF NEEDED SUPPLIES--SEEDS MEAT CORN-MEAL COFFEE SUGAR ETC
BEFORE HER LAY THE LETTER READ A DOZEN TIMES
WHY IN A SURPRISED TONE
HER MIND SEEMED VERY CLEAR
AT THIS MOMENT MRS VANDERPOOL RISING FROM A GALA DINNER IN THE BRILLIANT DRAWING-ROOM OF HER LAKE GEORGE MANSION WAS READING THE EVENING PAPER WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD PUT INTO HER HANDS
BUT IT HAD BEEN HUMAN
REALLY NOW HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE DISTRESSING INCREASE IN CRIME AMONG YOUR PEOPLE SHE SWUNG INTO THE GREAT ROAD TREMBLING WITH THE WOE OF THE WORLD IN HER EYES
MRS GREY'S HEART WARMED TO THE SIGHT OF HELEN IN HER MOMENTS OF SPASMODIC CARING FOR THE SICK AND AFFLICTED ON THE ESTATE
IT DOES NOT FLY WITH SUNLIGHT SHE SAID QUICKLY WITH AN UPWARD GLANCE
IF IT GOES TO SIX HE KEPT MURMURING WE'RE RUINED--IF IT GOES TO SIX--IF TICK SOUNDED THE WHEEL AND THE SOUND REVERBERATED LIKE SUDDEN THUNDER IN HIS EARS
UNDERNEATH THIS CALM HOWEVER THE ACTIVITY WAS REDOUBLED
BUT HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO HAND MAXWELL A THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND NOW OH GOD
THE RAIN-DROPS WERE STILL DRIPPING AND GLEAMING FROM THE TREES FLASHING BACK THE HEAVY YELLOW SUNLIGHT
NOW BLES SHE BEGAN SINCE WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER CAN WE NOT WORK TOGETHER AS GOOD FRIENDS SHE SPOKE SIMPLY AND FRANKLY WITHOUT APPARENT EFFORT AND TALKED ON AT LENGTH OF HER WORK AND VISION
DO YOU LIVE ABOUT HERE SHE ASKED
SO TONIGHT SHE SLIPPED AWAY STOPPED AND LISTENED TILL SHE HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE PIKE AND THEN FLEW HOMEWARD
THE GOLD OF THE SUNLIGHT FADED TO A SICKLY GREEN AND THE EARTH WAS BLACK AND BURNED
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
CRESSWELL LOST NO TIME IN CALLING ON SENATOR SMITH AND POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT BLES ALWYN WAS A DANGEROUS NEGRO
IF AS SHE FEARED HE SHOULD SUSPECT HER ON ACCOUNT OF THIS NEGRO WOMAN AND QUARREL WITH HER BUT HE MUST NOT
SACRIFICE
HE REACHED THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT AND ZORA STARTED
SHE BROUGHT THE MORNING PAPER INTO THE DINING-ROOM AND SAT DOWN WITH IT SIPPING HER COFFEE
THERE WAS NO CORDIALITY IN THE LATTER'S GREETING BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE CALLER'S ERRAND HER ATTENTION WAS AT ONCE ARRESTED AND HELD
SHE DID NOT KNOW
SHE DID NOT KNOW
SHE SAW A DINGY LUNCHROOM MARKED COLORED BUT SHE HAD NO TIME TO GO TO IT FOR HER TRAIN WAS READY
BUT BEFORE YES BEFORE MY GOD SHE KNEW THE END HAD COME
THERE WAS NO TANGIBLE REASON WHY AND YET TODAY SHE HAD SHUT HERSELF IN HER DEN
SHE HAD FELT A STRANGE INTEREST IN HER--A PECULIAR HUMAN INTEREST SINCE SHE FIRST SAW HER AND AS SHE SAW HER AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON
DEATH AND PAIN SHE MURMURED
BUT IT'S A MIGHTY BIG EXPERIMENT AND IT MAY GO AWRY NOT WITH BRAINS AND MONEY TO GUIDE IT
I BELONG TO THE CIVIC CLUB AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH IT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME HIS RESENTMENT GREW AS HE PROCEEDED
HERE PULSED THE VERY LIFE AND BEING OF THE LAND
IT WON'T DO SHE OBJECTED
MOREOVER YOU SENT ME A PERSONAL LETTER MRS CRESSWELL WAS SURE THAT THIS WAS A LIE AND WAS THOROUGHLY INCENSED
THE PRESIDENT WAS COMING AND MOST OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HIGH OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND ALL THE SOCIAL LEADERS
THE CONDUCTOR HAD ALREADY APPROPRIATED TWO SEATS FOR HIMSELF AND THE NEWSBOY ROUTED OUT TWO COLORED PASSENGERS AND USURPED TWO OTHER SEATS
SHE WAS A HORRIBLE THING--FILTHY OF BREATH DIRTY WITH DRIBBLING MOUTH AND RED EYES
I AM TRYING ALL THE TIME BUT THERE ARE MORE THINGS THAN MY WEAK STRENGTH CAN DO
THE WORLD WAS HIS
BUT BEFORE HE ANSWERED THEY BOTH FORGOT
FOR HERE WALKED HER GHOST AGAIN
THIS BEGINNING WAS A BIT OMINOUS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED
AGAIN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MRS GREY MRS GREY WAS A PICTURE OF THE MOST EMPHATIC SURPRISE AND MR CRESSWELL MOVED TO THE WINDOW
AT THE MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE TURNED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET HER
THAT IS I BELIEVE YOU SENT A GROUP TO THE ART EXHIBIT YES IT WAS GOOD--VERY GOOD MISS WYNN SAID NOTHING BUT SAT CALMLY LOOKING AT HER VISITOR
MRS VANDERPOOL'S VERY FIRST CAUTIOUS INQUIRIES BY WAY OF THE BACK STAIRS BROUGHT GRATIFYING RESPONSE--FOR DID NOT ALL BLACK WASHINGTON KNOW WELL OF THE WORK IN SCULPTURE DONE BY MRS SAMUEL STILLINGS NEE WYNN
SENATOR SMITH WAS UNCONVINCED
I'D MARRY CARRIE--BUT HOW CAN I HELP YOU THIS WAY
BUT MY POINT IS SIMPLY THIS
WHEN HE LEARNED ALL THE PARTICULARS OF ALWYN'S VISIT TO SENATOR SMITH AND HIS CORDIAL RECEPTION HE JUDGED IT BEST TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THIS YOUNG MAN AND HE FORTHWITH INVITED BLES TO ACCOMPANY HIM THE NEXT NIGHT TO THE FIFTEENTH STREET PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
THE WHOLE STREET WAS A LIVING INSULT TO HER
THE MILL-HANDS WERE MORE AND MORE OVERWORKED AND UNDERPAID AND HATED THE NEGROES FOR IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LEADERS DIRECTIONS
THEY SPRAWLED ABOUT AND SMOKED DRANK AND BOUGHT CANDY AND CHEAP GEWGAWS
ONE THING ALONE LAY IN HER WILD FANCY LIKE A GREAT AND WONDERFUL FACT DRAGGING THE DREAM TO EARTH AND ANCHORING IT THERE
FROM THE CRESSWELLS AND THE MAXWELLS AND OTHERS CAME LOADS OF CLOTHES FOR WASHING AND MENDING
MY GOD HER SILENT SOUL WAS SHRIEKING WITHIN WHY DOESN'T THE COWARD AND THEN THE COWARD DID
BUT I MEAN THAT I AM HERE TO LEARN FROM THOSE WHOSE IDEAS OF RIGHT DO NOT AGREE WITH MINE TO DISCOVER WHY THEY DIFFER AND TO LET THEM LEARN OF ME--SO FAR AS I AM WORTHY MARY TAYLOR WAS NOT UNAPPRECIATIVE OF MISS SMITH'S STERN HIGH-MINDEDNESS BUT HER HEART HARDENED AT THIS TO HER MISDIRECTED ZEAL
YOU ARE WORSE FATHER SHE ASKED
NO OF CLEVELAND
THEN SHE REALIZED THAT HALF OF IT WAS CUT OFF FOR THE WHITE SMOKERS AND AS THE DOOR SWUNG WHIFFS OF THE SMOKE CAME IN
HER FAVORITE GAME JUST NOW IS NEGRO EDUCATION AND SHE'S PLANNING TO GO IN HEAVY
AS THE COLONEL AND JOHN TAYLOR WERE THUS CONFERRING ZORA APPEARED COMING UP THE WALK
THAT'S TOO BAD HE SAID
AT THE SIGHT OF THE LADY SHE DREW SUDDENLY BACK AND STOOD MOTIONLESS REGARDING MISS TAYLOR SEARCHING HER WITH WIDE BLACK LIQUID EYES
ZORA STEPPED INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT
SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF GREETINGS
WE GET BACK OUR LAND AND HE MAKES GOOD WAGES FOR HIS WORK BUT IN THE TENTH CASE--SUPPOSE HE SHOULD STICK TO IT OH,"--EASILY WE COULD GET RID OF HIM WHEN WE WANT TO
WELL NOW IF ALWYN SHOULD ACT UNWISELY AND OFFEND THE SOUTH SOMEBODY ELSE STANDS IN LINE FOR THE APPOINTMENT AS TREASURER SHE ASKED IN SURPRISE
MEANTIME WE'LL BUY BUT TAYLOR HERE ARE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OFFERED AT SIX AND THREE-FOURTHS I TELL YOU TAYLOR CRESSWELL HALF AROSE
JUST HERE AGAIN SHE WAS PUZZLED
SHE SAID QUICKLY
I AM MORE AND MORE IMPRESSED MRS GREY WITH YOUR WISDOM IN PLACING LARGE INVESTMENTS IN THE SOUTH
BUT AT ANY RATE HAVE A SEAT A MOMENT OUT HERE ON THE VERANDAH MISS TAYLOR
BUT STILL T IS THE SPORT TO SEE THE ENGINEER HOIST BY HIS OWN PETAR BLES MUSED AND SHE WATCHED HIM COVERTLY
DON'T THROW THE DIRT TOO HIGH THERE SHE BEGGED
THE SENATOR'S EYES DROPPED AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND FOR THE SECOND NOTE
THEN OF A SUDDEN UP FROM THE DARKNESS CAME MUSIC
WELL HURRY AS THEY STOOD TOGETHER THE WHITE WOMAN DEEMED THE MOMENT OPPORTUNE
IT'S STUCK ALMOST IN OUR FRONT YARD
THEN TWO THOUSAND WOULD BE WANTED FOR NEW TEACHERS AND A CARPENTER SHOP--TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
THAT'S WHAT I SAID I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW SHE ANSWERED STIFFLY
SHE WAS LOST FOREVER
HE SAYS THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS A VOODOO WOMAN AND THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE DEACONS VOTED THAT THE MEMBERS MUSTN'T HELP YOU AND DO THE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SHE ASKED IN CONSTERNATION
IT FLATTERED HIS VANITY
I'SE GETTING OLD HE EXPLAINED AND I AIN'T GOT NOBODY TO TAKE CARE OF ME
HE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO BE SIMPLY HUMAN A LEARNER AND A FOLLOWER
AT LAST HE SAW HER COMING SWINGING DOWN THE ROAD LITHE AND DARK WITH THE BIG WHITE BASKET OF CLOTHES POISED ON HER HEAD
THEN HER HANDS QUIVERED
YOU JUST BEAR HEAVY ON IT--COOEPERATE WITH THE CRESSWELLS WHY YES
SHE WAS TO REVIVIFY THE MANHOOD IN HARRY CRESSWELL AND ALL THIS FOR NO RETURN NO PARTNERSHIP OF SOUL--ALL WAS TO BE COMPLETE SACRIFICE AND SINKING SOUL IN SOUL
CAREFUL
BUT MISS WYNN'S GREETING WAS SO QUIETLY CORDIAL THAT HIS EMBARRASSMENT SOON FLED
TAYLOR PAID HIM SLIGHT COURTESY
IT WAS THE APPROACH OF A WOMAN WHO KNEW HOW THE WORLD TREATED WOMEN WHOM IT RESPECTED
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY BUT HE ASKED FOR AN APPOINTMENT
NOT FOR YOUR SALVATION BUT THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD THE AUDIENCE GAVE A LOW UNEASY GROAN AND THE MINISTER IN WHOSE PULPIT THE STRANGER PREACHED STIRRED UNEASILY
OH I THOUGHT YOU SAID I MEANT OUR BALL OH SAID MRS VANDERPOOL IN TURN
I WOULD NOT MIND A THOUSAND OR SO TO TRAIN A GOOD COOK FOR THE CRESSWELLS OR A CLEAN AND FAITHFUL MAID FOR MYSELF--FOR HELENE HAS FAULTS--OR INDEED DEFT AND TRACTABLE LABORING-FOLK FOR ANY ONE
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY KNOW MUCH SHE CONCLUDED
WELL I MUST HURRY--GOOD DAY WHILE BLES ALWYN IN THE OUTER OFFICE WAS WAITING AND MUSING A LADY CAME IN
GO TO HIM TODAY
I HAD TO PAY MAXWELL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO GET THAT OLD DARKY AND HIS BOYS TURNED OVER TO ME AND ONE OF THE YOUNG ONES HAS RUN AWAY ALREADY HARRY LIGHTED A CIGARETTE
NOW THIS ATTITUDE WAS BEING REVOLUTIONIZED
COLONEL CRESSWELL WITH THE PERVERSITY OF THE SIMPLE-MINDED HAD TAKEN THE SUDDEN BETTERING OF THEIR FORTUNES AS HIS OWN DOING
I SHALL NOT FORGET MISS WYNN--NOR HER FRIENDS AND HE BOWED GLANCING AT ALWYN
FINALLY HE POINTED TO LINCOLN'S PICTURE AND TO SUMNER'S AND MENTIONED OTHER WHITE FRIENDS
ACROSS BROAD FIELDS AND BACK AGAIN OVER TO THE BARTON PIKE AND ALONG THE SWAMP
WILL YOU MARRY ME SHE LOOKED AT HIM CALMLY WITH INFINITE COMPASSION
IT WAS RESTFUL AND BEAUTIFUL FROM THE CHEERFUL PINE BLAZE BEFORE WHICH MISS SMITH WAS SITTING TO THE SQUARE-PANED WINDOW THAT LET IN THE CRIMSON RAYS OF GATHERING NIGHT
THE OBJECT OF HIS WATCHING WAS FRANKLY STATED TO HIMSELF AND TO HIS WORLD
THE WENCH WAS ALWAYS ELUDING AND MOCKING HIM THE BLACK DEVIL
THEN TOO HE MISSED THE LOUD BUT HEARTY GOOD-NATURE OF WHAT HE HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIS PEOPLE TO BE SURE A MORE EXPERIENCED OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE NOTED A LIVELY EXCITABLE TROPICAL TEMPERAMENT SET AND CAST IN A COLD NORTHERN MOULD AND YET FLASHING FIRE NOW AND THEN IN A SUDDEN ANOMALOUS OUT-BURSTING
SHE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STAIRS
WHAT DID SHE THINK
THOMPSON SAYS HE'S A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE NEGROES
THE FARMERS LEAGUE CAN DO THE CORNERING AND HOLD IT FOR HIGHER PRICES LORD SON
BANG PERSISTED THE HARD KNUCKLES
THEY DON'T REALLY RULE
SHE NEEDS NOT EXACTLY AFFECTION--SHE WOULD ALMOST RESENT THAT--BUT INTELLIGENT INTEREST AND CARE
WE ALL NEED MONEY AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO NEED MRS GREY'S MORE THAN MISS SMITH DOES AT PRESENT MISS TAYLOR FOUND THE LAKE GEORGE COLONY CHARMING
BUT AND HER FACE FELL I CAN'T GET MONEY ENOUGH TO BOARD IN
YOU'LL MARRY HIM AND BUT MISS TAYLOR LEAPT TO HER FEET WITH BLAZING CHEEKS
ELSPETH IS SICK REPLIED ZORA
MRS CRESSWELL POURED OUT THE NEWS
HIS HEART SAID
I THOUGHT I'D COME OVER AND SEE ABOUT GETTING MY SUPPLIES AT YOUR STORE THAT'S ALL RIGHT
SO SHE LOOKED ON THE WORLD ABOUT HER WITH NEW EYES
THE DISPLAY OF WEALTH AND SPLENDOR HAD A TOUCH OF THE BARBARIC
THEY HAD AN AUTOMOBILE AND FOUR SERVANTS AND THE HOUSE WAS FURNISHED LUXURIOUSLY
IN FACT HE HAD NOT DECIDED
THE THING MUSTN'T STOP HERE SHOUTED SHERIFF COLTON
I CAN'T WORK AS I ONCE COULD AND DE OVERSEERS DEY DRIVES ME TOO HARD
ONCE HE DISCOVERED HIMSELF STANDING BY A MARBLE STATUE OF A NUDE WOMAN AND HE EDGED AWAY
DO YOU THINK THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF CORNERING COTTON AND BUYING THE BLACK BELT IF THE NIGGERS ARE UNWILLING TO WORK UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS
WHO HE DEMANDED
ANYTHING ON YES--BIG SPREE AT NELL'S
YOU'VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT EXPENSES THAT I THOUGHT I'D SEND THIS WORD ON
NO LIVING SOUL HAD EVER RAISED IN HER SO DEEP AN AFFECTION AND YET SHE KNEW NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE COST WAS GREAT SHE WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE ZORA FOR PARIS
WHY NOT GO SEE HIM
SHE WAS VERY SOLEMN AS THEY RODE ON AND NIGHT CAME DOWN WITH DREAMS
IF I WERE YOU I'D THINK LESS OF ZORA AND MORE OF HER WORK GRADUALLY IN HIS SPIRITUAL PERPLEXITY ALWYN TURNED TO MARY CRESSWELL
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE AND AS SHE THOUGHT SHE CREPT FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FEARFUL FACE PITYINGLY
HE GREETED BLES WITH A COMPREHENSIVE WAVE OF THE HAND
IN FRONT WAS THE HIGH PILLARED PORCH SEMI-CIRCULAR EXTENDING TO THE ROOF WITH A BALCONY IN THE SECOND STORY
YET EVEN THEN HIS HAND TREMBLED AND THAT CURIOUS DOUBT CAME CREEPING BACK
SHE ONLY SAID
SHE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT SHE HAD FOLLOWED HIM TO SAVE HIM NOT TO BETRAY HIM
MISS WYNN WALKED SLOWLY UP PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE
I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL HE STARED AT THE LINES
THEY WERE SCANNING THE EARTH
HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE TURNED ON HIS PILLOW
HARRY CRESSWELL PAUSED A SECOND AND SWEPT HER FULL LENGTH WITH HIS EYE--HER PROFILE THE LONG SUPPLE LINE OF BOSOM AND HIP THE LITTLE FOOT
SHE MUST BE SENT TO BOARDING-SCHOOL SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY
TEERSWELL GLANCED AT HIM
ANSWER ME HE WHISPERED IN A VOICE HARD WITH ITS TIGHT HELD SOBS
YES THEY IS DEVILS DOWN YONDER BEHIND THE SWAMP SHE WOULD WHISPER WARNINGLY WHEN AFTER THE FIRST MEETING HE HAD CREPT BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN HALF FASCINATED HALF AMUSED TO GREET HER
HE ORDERED WHISKEY AND TAKING PAPER AND PENCIL BEGAN TO FIGURE DRINKING AS HE FIGURED
YOU KNOW--I WANT HIM_--I WANT NOTHING ON EARTH BUT HIM--AND HIM I CAN'T EVER HAVE THE OLDER WOMAN DREW HER DOWN TENDERLY
SOMEHOW IT LOOKED LIKE THE SWAMP ONLY LESS BEAUTIFUL
IT IS NO CRIME THEN HE NOTED THE EXPRESSION ON HER FACE AND PAUSED
AFTER ALL ZORA NO MAN IS QUITE WORTH A WOMAN'S SOUL
THE THING WAS TOO BIG FOR HIS IMAGINATION
IS IT FAIR
IT'S ALL UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE THE SCHOOL WHICH HE HAD COME TO REGARD AS ON ITS LAST LEGS SOMEHOW STILL CONTINUED TO FLOURISH
BLES ALMOST THOU PERSUADEST ME--TO BE A FOOL
MR ALWYN AS YOU KNOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO GET THE NEGRO VOTE IN THIS CAMPAIGN
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUT TONIGHT HE LAUGHED AWKWARDLY
THE MORNING WAS SPLENDID WITH THAT FIRST DELICIOUS LANGUOR OF THE SPRING WHICH BREATHES OVER THE SOUTHLAND IN FEBRUARY
YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED SOBS WERE RISING AND SHAKING HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT SHE DROVE THEM BACK AND GRIPPED HER BREASTS WITH HER HANDS
HE ARRAYED THE ARGUMENTS SIDE BY SIDE
HERE IN LESS THAN A WEEK GO TWO PLOUGH-HANDS--AND NOW THIS GIRL THE OLD MAN SMILED
HOW IS YOU TOLERABLE HOW ARE YOU POORLY SON POORLY--AND WORSER IN MIND
AND THEN TO DRAIN THE LAST DROP HIS HANDS TOUCHED HERS AND THE SHOCK OF FLESH FIRST MEETING FLESH STARTLED THEM BOTH WHILE THE WATER RAINED THROUGH
WHAT HE NEEDED WAS A SUPERIOR PERSON LIKE HERSELF
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS RISKING HIS WHOLE PRIVATE FORTUNE TO HOLD THE PRICE OF COTTON AND SOME EFFORT SEEMED TO BE NEEDED FOR COTTON DROPPED TO NINE CENTS WITHIN A WEEK
MRS GREY WANTED TO HEAR THE INCIDENT BUT THE YOUNG MAN WAS POLITELY RELUCTANT
PERHAPS IN THE SWAMP SAID MRS VANDERPOOL LIGHTLY LOOKING UP AT THE SOMBRE TREES THAT LINED THE LEFT
SHE LOOSENED HER DRESS AT THE NECK AND FLEW ON
IT IS THE SILVER FLEECE SAID ZORA AND MRS VANDERPOOL KISSED HER AND WENT
MRS CRESSWELL FOUND HERSELF TAKING PART
IN ITS MIDST ROSE A DARK SLIM AND QUIVERING FORM
NO MORE TALK
IF HE REPRESENTS MONEY AND HAS MONEY AND IF THE TRUST HAS REALLY GOT THE GRIP HE SAYS IT HAS WHY IT'S A CASE OF CRUSH OR GET CRUSHED AND WE'LL HAVE TO JOIN THEM ON THEIR OWN TERMS
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND NODDED TO THE TWO BOYS AT WORK IN A YOUNG COTTON FIELD
HE PAUSED UNCERTAINLY AT A PARTING OF THE PATHS CRYING
NOW AGAIN CONTINUED JOHN TAYLOR
SHE WAS NOT EASILY MOVED BUT THAT SPEECH HAD MOVED HER
SHE WALKED ON WORLDS AND WORLDS OF WORLDS AND HEARD THERE IN HER LITTLE ROOM THE TREAD OF ARMIES THE PAEANS OF VICTORY THE BREAKING OF HEARTS AND THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES
I'M--I'M A HALF A MILLION AHEAD--GREAT HEAVENS THE TICKER WHIRRED 8-3/4--9--9-1/2--10 THEN IT STOPPED DEAD
WE'VE GOT THE STOCK SO PLACED THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A POPULAR UPHEAVAL CAN SEND ANY CHILD LABOR BILL THROUGH CONGRESS IN SIX YEARS
I USED TO TEACH COLORED PEOPLE SHE WATCHED THIS NEW GROUP GATHER
THEN YOU CARE--FOR ME YES HE BENT FORWARD AND CAST THE DIE
SHE WAS TIRED
NO MISS TAYLOR THEY JOINED THE OTHERS AND ALL WERE TURNING TOWARD THE CARRIAGE WHEN A FIGURE COMING DOWN THE ROAD ATTRACTED THEM
A LONG TIME AFTERWARD SHE FOUND HERSELF LYING IN BED AWAKE CONSCIOUS CLEAR-MINDED
LIARS HAVE NO PLACE IN HEAVEN AND HEAVEN IS DOUBTLESS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE--BUT OH ZORA
PAPER SAYS THE CROP IS LARGER THAN THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE SAID TOLLIVER AND ADDED THERE'LL BE NO PAINTING THIS YEAR HE LOOKED TOWARD THE SMITH SCHOOL AND THOUGHT OF THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAITING
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE HAD DARED DREAM A FORBIDDEN DREAM
YOU SEE MARY'S GOWN WILL LOOK MISERABLY COMMON BESIDE IT THE DRESSMAKER WAS VOLUBLE
I REGARD ZORA AS A VERY UNDESIRABLE PERSON FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
ALL OF US
ALL OF US
REALLY THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF INTRIGUE IN THIS CITY ALMOST FRIGHTENED HER AS SHE WALKED DEEPER INTO THE MIRE
THE OLD WOMAN WAS SHORT BROAD BLACK AND WRINKLED WITH YELLOW FANGS RED HANGING LIPS AND WICKED EYES
THEY NO LONGER LIGHTLY CLASPED HANDS
SHE LISTENED FOR THE CRACK OF DOOM
BUT YOU SEEMED VERY FRIENDLY WITH SENATOR SMITH WHO INTRODUCED IT
SHE WENT TO WORK TACTFULLY SEEMING TO NOTE NO CHANGE IN HIS MANNER TOWARD HER
BUT SHE DID NOT
THE RAIN SWEPT DOWN IN LAUGHING BUBBLING SHOWERS AND LAVED THEIR THIRSTY SOULS AND ZORA HELD HER BEATING BREAST DAY BY DAY LEST IT RAIN TOO LONG OR TOO HEAVILY
I'D SOONER HAVE NIGGERS NOW SEE HERE ARGUED TAYLOR YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT--DAY'S GONE BY FOR ARISTOCRACY OF OLD KIND
AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT CONSIDER THE EASTERLYS AND THE TAYLORS AND SUCH FOLK AS THE SOCIAL EQUALS OF THE CRESSWELLS AND HIS PREJUDICE ON THIS SCORE MUST STILL BE RECKONED WITH
HIS FATHER IT WAS WHO HAD BUILT THE LAKE GEORGE COTTAGE
LEAGUE HOLDS THREE MILLION BALES AND CONTROLS FIVE
AND AT ANY RATE WE'VE GOT TO TRY IT
THE ROAD TURNED NOW AND FAR AWAY TO THE EASTWARD ROSE THE FIRST STRAGGLING CABINS OF THE TOWN
TO SUPPLY THE REST OF THE INTEREST AND THE DEFICIT IN THE RUNNING EXPENSES FROM OUR BALANCE AND TO SEND YOU NORTH TO BEG ZORA SHOOK HER HEAD
ON THE WHOLE MR EASTERLY WAS GLAD OF HIS PARTNER'S DEFINITE WITHDRAWAL SINCE HE LEFT HIS CAPITAL BEHIND HIM UNTIL HE FOUND HIS VAST PLANS ABOUT TO BE CIRCUMVENTED BY MRS GREY WITHDRAWING THIS CAPITAL FROM HIS CONTROL
IT IS SO LATE AND WET AND YOU'RE TIRED TONIGHT--DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BETTER SLEEP IN YOUR LITTLE ROOM ZORA SAT STILL
HARRY CRESSWELL WENT TO MONTGOMERY
HER LOVE COME BACK HER STOLEN DREAM COME TRUE
THAT MILL'S ABOUT KILLED HIM SHE SAID
TIGHTER AND TIGHTER THE REINS GREW ON THE BACKS OF THE BLACK TENANTS
OF COURSE I SUPPOSE THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
WE WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO IMPROVE IT SUPPOSE WE DIDN'T WANT IT IMPROVED THAT'S WHAT SOME SAID
BUT HE CONTINUED
ZORA WATCHED IT GO AND HER HEART SWELLED AND DIED WITHIN HER
BETTER SEE IF YOU CAN RUN IT DOWN
WHEN HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR FELLOWSHIP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A STRANGE DILEMMA
COME LET'S GO BACK TO POOR DEAR MISS SMITH SUGGESTED MARY
THE QUEST OF THE SILVER FLEECE A NOVEL W.E.B
HE FELT IN THE DARK THOUSANDS OF HIS KIND ABOUT HIM A MIGHTY CALLING TO DEEDS
HE HAD HER NOTES HER SUGGESTIONS HER HINTS BUT SHE HAD NO INTIMATION OF WHAT HE WOULD FINALLY SAY
SO PASSED A YEAR AND THERE CAME THE TIME WHEN HER WAYWARD TEASING AND THE ALMOST PAINFUL THRILL OF HER TALE-TELLING NETTLED HIM AND DROVE HIM AWAY
OUR PROPERTY IS THEREFORE CONSERVATIVELY VALUED AT TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
STILLINGS IS A GOOD MAN ADMITTED SMITH
AND SEE THAT NONE IS STOLEN
THE FORM OF THE OLD WOMAN SUDDENLY LOOMED BLACK ABOVE THEM HOVERING A MOMENT FORMLESS AND VAST THEN FADING AGAIN AWAY AND THE SWISH-SWISH OF THE FALLING SEED ALONE ROSE IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
ABOUT ITS STORES ITS PEOPLE--ESPECIALLY ITS PEOPLE
SHREWD MR STILLINGS THE SENATOR CORRECTED
YOU JOIN THE OTHERS AND DON'T WAIT FOR ME AND I WILL BE ALONG DIRECTLY MRS GREY WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO ESCAPE AND MR BOCOMBE GOT A CHANCE TO TALK
BUT BESIDE AND AROUND AND ABOVE ALL THIS LIKE SUBTLE PERMEATING ETHER WAS--ZORA
BUT WHILE SHE SPOKE THE GIRL MERELY STARED AT HER IN STONY SILENCE
INSTEAD OF THIS MISS SMITH WAS CHEERFULLY EXPANDING THE WORK HIRING NEW TEACHERS AND ESPECIALLY SHE HAD BROUGHT TO HELP HER TWO YOUNG NEGROES WHOM HE SUSPECTED
EDUCATED NEGRO LABOR MIGHT BE WORTH MORE TO NEGROES BUT NOT TO THE COTTON COMBINE
HE'S EIGHTEEN NOW--QUITE A MAN AND MOST INTERESTING TO TALK WITH H'M--VERY"--DRILY
THEY SAW ONE CLASS RISING FROM BENEATH THEM TO POWER AND THEY TIGHTENED THE CHAINS ON THE OTHER
AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU PAID A YEAR I GEN'RALLY PAYS BOUT THREE BALES OF COTTON A YEAR DOES HE FURNISH YOU RATIONS ONLY SUGAR AND COFFEE AND A LITTLE MEAT NOW AND THEN WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO A YEAR I DOESN'T RIGHTLY KNOW--BUT I'SE GOT SOME PAPERS HERE MISS SMITH LOOKED THEM OVER AND SIGHED
I KNOWS THAT--I KNOWS IT AND I AIN'T SHIRKING
SO THEY TALKED ON UNKNOWING THAT FAR UP THE ROAD THE CRESSWELL COACHES WERE WHEELING ALONG WITH PRECIOUS BURDENS
BUT AT LAST SHE SANK INTO THE CHAIR AGAIN AND SAT DRY-EYED WONDERING WHO HAD CONCEIVED THIS WORLD AND MADE IT AND WHY
AND THEN I CAME TO SEE THE PEOPLE AND SUDDENLY I KNEW THE CITY WAS LIKE THE SWAMP ALWAYS RESTLESS AND CHANGING AND MORE BEAUTIFUL SUGGESTED MRS VANDERPOOL SLIPPING HER ARMS INTO HER LOUNGING-ROBE
YOU COULD RECOMMEND THIS DEAL THEN COULD YOU--TO YOUR OWN FRIENDS TO MY OWN FAMILY ASSERTED JOHN TAYLOR LOOKING AT HARRY CRESSWELL WITH SUDDEN INTEREST
THE FIRST PART OF THE QUERY DID NOT BOTHER HER
HE WOULD REMEMBER TO HIS DYING DAY ONE AWFUL SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT AS OF A SOUL TORMENTING AND TORMENTED
CRESSWELL'S LAWYER SAW ONLY THIS BLACK WOMAN--NO OTHER LAWYER OR SIGN OF ONE APPEARED TO REPRESENT HER
YOU'LL SPEND THE NIGHT OF COURSE CAN'T POSSIBLY--MUST CATCH THAT NEXT TRAIN BACK BUT WE MUST TALK FURTHER THE COLONEL INSISTED
THE WORLD WAS GOING WELL WITH THE COLONEL
DOES YOU WANT--A COLLECTION HE QUESTIONED SUSPICIOUSLY FOR HE COULD IMAGINE FEW OTHER REASONS FOR TALKING
THE DRESSMAKER WAS IN DESPAIR
IF YOU SIT THUS BROODING YOU'LL GO CRAZY DO CRAZY FOLKS FORGET NONSENSE ZORA MISS SMITH RIDICULED THE GIRL'S FANTASTIC VAGARIES
MISS TAYLOR FELT RATHER THAN HEARD THEIR WORDS AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
GOOBERS ANSWERED THE SMALLER BOY
I TOLD MY FATHER BUT HE IN LAZY INDIFFERENCE DECLARED THE PLACE NO WORSE THAN ALL NEGRO CABINS AND DID NOTHING
THE DEMAND FOR COTTON AT HIGH PRICES USUALLY FELL OFF RAPIDLY AND HE HAD HEARD RUMORS OF CURTAILED MILL PRODUCTION
THE WOMAN CRIED AND THE YELLOW MAN RAISED HIS ARM THREATENINGLY
AS HE ENTERED CRESSWELL'S PLANTATION STORE THREE DAYS LATER A COLORED WOMAN WITH A LITTLE BOY TURNED SADLY AWAY FROM THE COUNTER
I BEG PARDON HE SAID GRINNING
HE WAS OUR MASTER AND ALL THE OTHER GIRLS THAT GATHERED THERE DID HIS WILL
NOT ON MY CALLING-LIST SAID MRS VANDERPOOL AND THEN SHE ADDED MORE THOUGHTFULLY
BUT THE COTTON GLOWED CRIMSON IN THE FAILING SUN
YOU RECOMMENDED HIM HIGHLY I KNEW OF HIM SLIGHTLY IN THE SOUTH AND I HAVE WATCHED HIS CAREER HERE IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO HAVE THAT CAREER SPOILED NOW BUT IS IT NECESSARY
I SUPPOSE THAT ONE WAS RIGHT AND ONE WAS WRONG NO SAID CRESSWELL BOTH WERE RIGHT I THOUGHT THE ONLY EXCUSE FOR FIGHTING WAS A GREAT RIGHT
CHANGE CARS SHE SCRAMBLED OUT
SHE WOULD NOT DARE
SEND ME EXPRESS TWO BALES BEST COTTON YOU CAN GET THE COLONEL READ THE MESSAGE
SOMETHING IN HER HEAD WAS READY TO SNAP
SHE SAT TODAY WITH HER DARK GOLD PROFILE TOWARD ZORA AND THE GIRL LOOKED AND WAS GLAD
WHO KNEW THAT NO SUCH TREATMENT WOULD BE THOUGHT OF IN HER CASE
FURTHERMORE WHILE NOT PRECISELY PRETTY SHE WAS GOOD-LOOKING AND INTERESTING AND SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE MARKS AND INSIGNIA OF GOOD BREEDING
THEN TOO SHE DID NOT KNOW ALL THESE MATTERS AND KNEW NO ONE WHO DID
HE TURNED SLOWLY TO HIS CHEERLESS HOUSE SHUDDERING AS HE ENTERED THE UNINVITING PORTALS
SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN OF THE ENDOWMENT FOR WHICH SHE HAD HOPED SO DESPERATELY DURING A QUARTER OF A CENTURY--NO ONLY FOR THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUY THE LONG NEEDED NEW LAND
WOULD SHE COULD SHE LAY ASIDE HER PRIDE AND CYNICISM HER DAINTY WAYS AND LITTLE EXTRAVAGANCES
JUDGE A FRIEND IS EXPECTING ME AT TWO IT WAS THEN HALF-PAST ONE WOULD I NOT BEST TELEPHONE STEP RIGHT INTO THE BOOTH SAID THE JUDGE QUITE INDULGENTLY MISS WYNN LEANED BACK AND BLES FELT HIS HEART SINKING
AND SAM CAN'T YOU FIND US A SANDWICH AND SOMETHING COOL
WHEN CAROLINE WYNN HEARD OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY CONVERSATION HER AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS
CERTAIN I'M NOT
SHE FELT A CLOSENESS AND A TREMOR A CERTAIN BROODING TERROR IN THE LANGUID SOMBRE WINDS
SIXTEEN THE GREAT REFUSAL ALL NIGHT MISS SMITH LAY HOLDING THE QUIVERING FORM OF ZORA CLOSE TO HER BREAST STARING WIDE-EYED INTO THE DARKNESS--THINKING THINKING
SLOWLY AND MYSTERIOUSLY IT LOOMED BEFORE HER--THAT SQUAT AND DARKSOME CABIN WHICH SEEMED TO FITLY SET IN THE CENTRE OF THE WILDERNESS BESIDE ITS CRAWLING SLIME
SHE GLANCED AT HER MEMORANDUM AGAIN TO SEE IF SHE WAS MISTAKEN
MR CRESSWELL HAS OFFERED ME FORTY ACRES OF GOOD LAND MISS SMITH LOOKED DISHEARTENED
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LAZY SHIFTLESS AND CRIMINAL NEGROES YOU FEARED HANG IT NO
THE SUN ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL IT BLAZED AT HIGH NOON
YOU'LL NEED TO GET IT PICKED RIGHT OFF HE SUGGESTED
GOOD-MORNING SHE SAID A LITTLE STIFFLY
I'M SAFE TAYLOR ASSURED HIM
EVERYBODY BUT HE KNEW--POOR BLIND DEAF MOLE STUPID JACKASS THAT HE WAS
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE THE SILENT JACKSON SPOKE UP
WE CAN'T QUITE FORGET THAT CAN WE NO I SUPPOSE NOT MISS TAYLOR ADMITTED A LITTLE HELPLESSLY
SIT DOWN REPEATED MISS SMITH HARSHLY
IT LOOKED LIKE SUCH A DOWNPOUR
YOU WAS A-FEARED HE BRIDLED
AND THAT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE WHERE IS SHE NOW MISS SMITH GLANCED OUT AT THE DARKENING LANDSCAPE AND THEN AT HER WATCH
AFTER ALL WHICH WAS WORSE--A CRESSWELL OR AN ALWYN
COTTON 42 SEVEN
I SAW SPLENDID MATERIAL FOR COOKS AND MAIDS AND PLOUGH-BOYS ADDED CRESSWELL
HE'S VERY STRONG
THE DIRTY STOVE WAS GLOWING WITH PINE-WOOD AND THE JUDGE SAT AT A DESK
ARE THEY NOT HARD WORKING HONEST PEOPLE YES MA'AM YET THEY ARE SLAVES--DUMB DRIVEN CATTLE BUT THEY HAVE NO EDUCATION AND YOU HAVE A SMATTERING
BUT WE OWN THE SOUTH AND PART OF THE PRICE IS PUTTING THE COLORED SCHOOLS OF THE DISTRICT IN THE HANDS OF A SOUTHERN MAN AND DEPRIVING US OF ALL VOICE IN THEIR CONTROL PRECISELY MISS WYNN
SHE CAME TO MISS SMITH SLOWLY AND PUT HER HANDS UPON HER SHOULDERS WITH ALMOST A CARESS
I KNEW IT SHE WHISPERED IN MINGLED TEARS AND JOY
A THRILL RAN THROUGH HIM AS HE FELT AGAIN THE WEIGHT OF A LITTLE HAND AND SAW BESIDE HIM THE DARK BEAUTIFUL EYES OF A GIRL
GRADUALLY AN UNDEMONSTRATIVE FRIENDSHIP SPRANG UP BETWEEN THE PALE OLD GRAY-HAIRED TEACHER AND THE DARK YOUNG BLACK-HAIRED GIRL
AND THEY CRIES AND CALLS
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE--AND UNTHINKABLE EVEN IF POSSIBLE
HE WAS SMILING SLIGHTLY BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE SIGNED HER NAME GRIMLY IN A LARGE ROUND HAND SARAH SMITH THIRTEEN MRS
THEN OF A SUDDEN THE UPROAR STOPPED AND THE RINGING OF AXES AND GRATING OF SAWS AND TUGGING OF MULES WAS HEARD
WITHIN LAY FOUR LINES OF WRITING--NO MORE--NO ADDRESS NO SIGNATURE
THE LEADING LAND-OWNERS SHE BEGAN SORTING THE NOTES SEARCHINGLY I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WELL COLONEL CRESSWELL IS OF COURSE OUR GREATEST LANDLORD--A HIGH-BRED GENTLEMAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL
I KNOWS MOST OF EM BETTER DAN DEY KNOWS DEMSELVES
HE LOOKED WORN AND WHITE AND TIRED BUT HE LAUGHED HER CONCERN LIGHTLY OFF
SHE HAD WORKED HARD
THE BUTLER MET THEM ALL OBEISANCE
THE THING WAS TOO VAST
OR WAS THE ELF-GIRL REAL
SEE HERE LET'S TALK TO EASTERLY ABOUT THIS THEY WENT INTO THE NEXT OFFICE AND AFTER A WHILE GOT AUDIENCE WITH THE TRUST MAGNATE
AND I KNOW THE WAY OUT HOW A COTTON MILL IN TOOMSVILLE WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT BRING IN WHITES BUT I DON'T WANT POOR WHITE TRASH
BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE KNEW THE WORLD
MRS VANDERPOOL WROTE A CHECK
AND I WANT TO SHOP AND CALL ON DOLLY'S FRIEND--SHE'S GOING SOON ALL RIGHT
MR CALDWELL SEEMED TO BE RIGHT FOR COTTON ROSE TO TEN CENTS A POUND--TEN AND A HALF--ELEVEN--AND THEN THE SOUTH BEGAN TO SEE VISIONS AND TO DREAM DREAMS
I HELPED BRING HER UP MYSELF AND DID ALL I COULD FOR HER AND SHE--SHE IS PURE
YOU ARE RIGHT ZORA
EVEN MAMMY WAS AFEARED
HE HAD SEEN MANY OTHERS THAT VERY DAY SWALLOW THE GOLDEN BAIT AND PROMISE EVERYTHING
THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL
THE EARTH STEAMED
SHE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT IN THIS PLEASANT LITTLE CHAT THE FACT OF THE BOY'S COLOR HAD QUITE ESCAPED HER
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND I DON'T JUDGE NO BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS HELP SEEING AND MEETING IT LAUGHED MISS TAYLOR
IN HER DIREST NEED HE HAD DESERTED HER
I'M NOT A SPEAKER
I'M AFRAID MISS SMITH DOES NOT APPROVE OF US WHITE SOUTHERNERS BUT YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU CAN'T EVEN ADVISE HER OH NO
NO IT WAS ONE AGAINST A WORLD A WORLD OF POWER OPINION WEALTH OPPORTUNITY
GOOD-MORNING
THEY HAD HOWEVER AN EARNEST CONSULTATION WITH JOHN TAYLOR
BEADS OF SWEAT GATHERED ON CRESSWELL'S FOREHEAD
AFTER ALL HE WAS ENTERING THIS HIGHER DARK WORLD WHOSE EXISTENCE HAD PIQUED AND PUZZLED HIM SO LONG
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE MANACLED BOY WAS LED INTO COURT AND THE WOMAN SUDDENLY TURNED AGAIN TO ZORA
LET ME DO IT HIS EYES FELL BEFORE THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER REBUKE
AFTER HER HOBBLED OLD SYKES
HE'S JUST FROM THE SOUTH AND I HAPPENED TO READ OF HIM THIS MORNING--SEE HERE MR EASTERLY READ AN ACCOUNT OF THE SPEECH AT THE BETHEL LITERARY
THEN FINDING ALL WELL SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND SLEPT
COME HERE HE PEERED INTO HER WHITE YOUNG FACE
WHERE WELL--THERE'S MISS SMITH SHE GETS A SALARY DOESN'T SHE A VERY SMALL ONE ABOUT AS LARGE AS SHE COULD EARN
THEN AT LAST ILLUMINATION DAWNED UPON HER BLINDNESS
EITHER THEY WERE DEALING WITH A FOOL OR ELSE A VERY ASTUTE POLITICIAN
HIS FATHER APPROACHED
BUT THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE AND SHE LEAPED TO ACTION
FOR THE FLEECE WAS GOODLY AND GLEAMING AND SOFT AND MEN DREAMED OF THE GOLD IT WOULD BUY
THE SITUATION IS THIS HE SAID
DOWN THE COURTHOUSE STEPS THE SHERIFF WITH WINCHESTER ON SHOULDER WAS BRINGING THE LAST PRISONER--A CURLY-HEADED BOY WITH GOLDEN FACE AND BIG BROWN FRIGHTENED EYES
BUT I DID NOT BELIEVE SUCH--DECEPTION THE BLOOD RUSHED TO CRESSWELL'S FACE
HE WAS SO GRACIOUS AND KINDLY AND HE KNOWS MY BROTHER
THE PAPER TREMBLED IN HER JEWELLED HANDS
I REMEMBER AND HE RAN ON ENDLESSLY NOW TO THIS ONE NOW TO THAT NOW TO ALL HIS LITTLE EYES ALL THE WHILE DANCING INSINUATINGLY HERE AND THERE
BUT CRESSWELL HAD HIMSELF WELL IN HAND
CRESSWELL WENT OUT ON THE HIGH-PILLARED PORCH UNTIL THE TRAP APPEARED
PLEASE SIT DOWN SHE REPEATED WITH HER SOFTEST CHARM NOT DREAMING THAT OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL WHITE PERSONS DID NOT ASK THIS GIRL TO SIT IN THEIR PRESENCE
YOU SEE HIS APPOINTMENT MEANT MINE WELL WHAT OF IT--DIDN'T LISTEN SHE CUT IN A LITTLE SHARPLY
AT ANY RATE I SAY GO AND SO HOWSOEVER RELUCTANTLY SHE HAD GONE
IT WAS HIS PUNISHMENT
WHY HAD THEY STOLEN FROM HER
THEN SOMEBODY WILL CORNER IT THE FARMERS LEAGUE WON'T STAND PRECISELY
I'SE LIVED HERE A HUNDRED YEARS HE ANSWERED
IN THREE NOTES DUE IN TWELVE TWENTY-FOUR AND THIRTY-SIX MONTHS INTEREST AT EIGHT PER CENT HELD BY THE COLONEL SNORTED HIS AMAZEMENT AND HARRY CRESSWELL CUT IN
WE'LL HAVE UNLIMITED CREDIT BUT--BUT STUTTERED THE BEWILDERED COLONEL I DON'T UNDERSTAND
BUT THE SUN HAD SAVED THE BEST AND THE PRICE HAD SOARED
NO SPONTANEITY EITHER--RATHER LANGUID DID YOU NOTICE
BUT SOON HE WOULD COME SEARCHING FOR HE CAME EACH HOUR AND SHE PRESSED HER LITTLE HANDS AGAINST HER BREAST TO STILL THE BEATING OF HER HEART AND THE BURSTING WONDER OF HER LOVE
BUT THE OWNER WAS A HARD AND IGNORANT WHITE MAN HATING NIGGERS ONLY A SHADE MORE THAN HE HATED WHITE ARISTOCRATS OF THE CRESSWELL TYPE
GOOD-BYE MISS SMITH STOOD A LONG TIME IN THE DOORWAY WATCHING THE FADING FIGURE AND VAGUELY TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE HAD STARTED TO DO WHEN THE SHARP STACCATO STEP OF A MULE DREW HER ATTENTION TO A RIDER WHO STOPPED AT THE GATE
MISS TAYLOR LEANED BACK AND WATCHED IT DREAMILY TILL A SENSE OF OPPRESSION GREW ON HER
MISS TAYLOR LAY BACK LISTLESSLY AND DRANK THE SOFT WARM AIR OF THE LANGUOROUS SPRING
MRS GRESSWELL SAT DOWN IN OPEN-MOUTHED ASTONISHMENT
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TALK TO THE BIG GIRLS AND PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN
MEN REELED TO SINGING WOMEN'S ARMS BUT ABOVE THE ROAR ROSE THE SONG OF THE VOICE OF ZORA--SHE GLIDED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM STANDING TIP-TOED WITH SKIRTS THAT CURLED AND TURNED
AND SANDERS HOW'S HIS COTTON GOOD AND A LOT OF IT HE'S TRYING TO GET AWAY
AND THEN WITH A FLUTTER SHE WAS BESIDE HIM AGAIN LAUGHING IN HIS EARS AND CRYING WITH MOCKING VOICE
OF NEGLECT AND SUFFERING OF THE SINS OF OTHERS THAT BOWED YOUNG SHOULDERS OF THE GREAT HOPE OF THE CHILDREN'S FUTURE
HE GREW PAINFULLY EMBARRASSED AND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING WAS AWKWARDLY SELF-CONSCIOUS
YES--I'LL TRY I'LL TRY
AH NELL DON'T SHRINK
I DO NOT KNOW ADDED MRS CRESSWELL I MAY BE WRONG AND--I HOPE I'M NOT GLAD THEN THERE LEAPT TO HER MIND A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION WHICH HAD TO DO WITH HER OWN CURIOUS SITUATION
I ESPECIALLY PICKED OUT THIS ALWYN BECAUSE HE WAS SOUTHERN AND TRACTABLE AND SEEMED TO HAVE SENSE ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW TO SAY WELL WHAT WE WANTED TO SAY WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT DRAWLED MRS VANDERPOOL HE WAS SIMPLY HONEST THE SOUTH WON'T STAND IT CRESSWELL DECISIVELY AFFIRMED
JOHN TAYLOR HAS JUST WRITTEN ME THAT HE'S STARTING MILLS AT TOOMSVILLE AND THAT HE DEPENDS ON UNRESTRICTED LABOR CONDITIONS AS WE MUST THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CARDS AND SUCH
THEY SEEMED SO HAPPY
HER MONEY TOO WAS TO HER AN EVER WORRYING MYSTERY AND SURPRISE WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF ALWAYS SCHEMING TO HUSBAND SHREWDLY AND SPEND PHILANTHROPICALLY--A DIFFICULT COMBINATION
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS FURTHER SURPRISED
ON THE NIGHT OF THE GATHERING AT MISS WYNN'S BLES DRESSED WITH CARE HESITATING LONG OVER A NECKTIE BUT AT LAST CHOOSING ONE WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED AND WHICH PLEASED HIM PARTICULARLY
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TIRED AND WANT TO BE ALONE YOU CAN COME UP HERE ZORA SAID MISS SMITH CARELESSLY
HER FEW LONG BLACK TEETH HUNG LOOSELY LIKE TUSKS AND THE FOLDS OF FAT ON HER CHIN CURLED DOWN ON HER GREAT NECK
THEN HER LOW BIRDLIKE LAUGHTER WOULD RISE AND RING THROUGH THE TREES
HE DID NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER AND SHE WAS EQUALLY RETICENT
BUT ALWYN IS BETTER
HE COULD NO LONGER ENDURE THIS SILENCE
HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND SOMBRE-HUED WITH A CARVEN FACE AND THICK GRAY HAIR
MOREOVER AND MISS TAYLOR'S VOICE GATHERED FIRMNESS DESPITE MISS SMITH'S INSCRUTABLE EYE MOREOVER I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THE DISPOSITION--INDEED THE PLAN--IN CERTAIN QUARTERS TO HELP THIS WORK MATERIALLY DEPENDS VERY LARGELY ON YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MEET THE ADVANCES OF THE SOUTHERN WHITES HALF WAY SHE PAUSED FOR A REPLY OR A QUESTION
WORK IS THE ONLY CURE FOR SUCH PAIN BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO DO--NOTHING I WANT TO DO--NOTHING WORTH DOING--NOW THE SILVER FLEECE THE GIRL SAT UPRIGHT
NAMELY MY APPOINTMENT SHE GAZED REFLECTIVELY OUT OF THE WINDOW
YOU WERE HAPPY TO MEET YOUR PEOPLE AND WHERE HE SAID ONE WORD YOU SUPPLIED TWO
FOR A MOMENT SOMETHING OF THE VISION OF COTTON WAS MIRRORED IN HER MIND
THE SHUDDER OF DEATH SHOOK HIS SOUL AND HE PASSED
BLES HANDED THE CARD TO THE SECRETARY WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY BUT THE SECRETARY DETAINED HIM
MISS TAYLOR EXPRESSED HER PLEASURE AT THE PROSPECT
SOMEWHAT TO MISS TAYLOR'S SURPRISE MISS SMITH SAID NOTHING UNTIL THEY WERE PARTING FOR THE NIGHT THEN SHE ASKED
BUT EVEN THIS DID NOT MOVE ZORA
SHE HAD BEEN TO CHURCH MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT UNDER THE SERMONS AND CEREMONIES SHE HAD ALWAYS SAT COLDLY INERT
THEN TOO THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS ARGUMENT
MANY THOUGHT SO AND HASTENED TO SELL
BUT I LOVE YOU AND YOU CAN MAKE ME GOOD PERHAPS NO OTHER APPEAL WOULD HAVE STIRRED MARY TAYLOR
I DO NOT BELONG IN THIS WORLD WHERE RIGHT AND WRONG GET SO MIXED
SLAVERY OF SOUL AND BODY AWAITS HER AND I AM POWERLESS TO PROTECT HER
AROUND THIS SCHOOL HOME AS AROUND THE CENTRE OF SOME LITTLE UNIVERSE HAD WHIRLED THE SORROWFUL SORDID LAUGHING PULSING DRAMA OF A WORLD
I BORROWED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
NEXT THING WROTE TAYLOR TO EASTERLY IS TO REDUCE COST OF PRODUCTION
AFAR THE SHRIEK OF THE MONTGOMERY TRAIN WAS HEARD ACROSS THE NIGHT MINGLING WITH THE WAIL OF A WAKEFUL BABE
AND WHERE DO WE COME IN THAT'S BUSINESS AFFIRMED JOHN TAYLOR
THERE WAS BUT ONE PLACE IN ALL THE EARTH FOR THEM TO MEET AND THAT WAS YONDER IN THE SILVER FLEECE
SHE WAS AN ELDERLY LADY IN THOSE UNCERTAIN YEARS BEYOND FIFTY AND HAD BEEN LEFT SUDDENLY WITH MORE MILLIONS THAN SHE COULD EASILY COUNT
THE PRICE IS BOUND TO GO UP COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS HESITANT EVEN DOUBTFUL
AFTER LUNCH HE WAS SURE THAT HE DID NOT WANT HER TO LEAVE
THE EMPTY NIGHT WAS CLOSING ALL ABOUT HIM HERE IN A STRANGE LAND AND HE WAS AFRAID
BUT MRS VANDERPOOL WAS CURIOUS AS TO THE CAUSE OF CRESSWELL'S ANGER
THEN SOMETHING LIKE AMUSEMENT LURKED A MOMENT IN HER EYE AND SHE QUIETLY PRESENTED BLES TO HER FRIENDS WHILE STILLINGS HOVERED UNNOTICED IN THE OFFING
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO DO WELL HERE IN WASHINGTON GENERAL PHILANTHROPY NO SPECIAL HER EYES WERE BRIGHT WITH MEANING
HE PLANNED TO STUDY AND ARRANGED WITH A PROFESSOR AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY TO GUIDE HIM
AND A WIDE BLACK PATCH OF RICH LOAM BROADENED AND BROADENED TILL IT KISSED ON EVERY SIDE BUT THE SHELTERED EAST THE BLACK WATERS OF THE LAGOON
AND THEN FINALLY SHE TOLD THEM OF THE LAND SHE WAS BUYING FOR NEW TENANTS AND THE HELPING HANDS SHE NEEDED
YES WITH POLITE INTEREST
WHEN IT GROPES AND TRIES TO ADJUST ONE WITH THE OTHER AND THROUGH THEM TO GIVE TO THE INNER DEEPER SELF FINER AND FULLER EXPRESSION
THERE MUST BE A DIFFERENCE ALWAYS ALWAYS
THE SUN FELL FAST
WHATEVER THEY WANT THEY WON'T GET SHE SAID DECISIVELY
I'VE LEFT YOUR GATE GAPING OH DON'T MIND
IF HIS INTENSE BELIEF HAPPENED TO BE POPULAR ALL RIGHT
AT LAST MISS SMITH SAID RISING STIFFLY
I FOUND EM AND I DASSEN'T SELL EM OPEN SEE
COLONEL CRESSWELL STOOD BY THE DOOR HIS HAT ON HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
ONE WAS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU OH FATHER SHE CRIED
SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT HE WOULD AND YET--THERE WAS A CERTAIN STEADFAST LOOK IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS EYES THAT MIGHT PROVE TO BE SHEER STUBBORNNESS
COULD I TRUST YOU WITH A HUMAN SOUL ASKED MISS SMITH ABRUPTLY
SHE ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING PERT AS YOU PLEASE THAT SHE COULDN'T TOTE CLOTHES ANY MORE--SHE HAD TO STUDY DAMN IT
SHE KNOWS QUITE TOO MUCH
AT HER THEY STARED AND MADE COMMENTS AND ONE OF THEM CAME AND LOUNGED ALMOST OVER HER SEAT INQUIRING WHERE SHE WAS GOING
HE WAS SHREWD WILLING TO STOOP TO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO WIN
I BEG PARDON DOES THE MISS WYNN LIVE HERE WHO GOT THE PRIZE IN THE ART EXHIBITION MRS CRESSWELL TURNED IN AMAZEMENT
AT LEAST A BALE TO THE ACRE ALWYN ESTIMATED AND THE COLONEL MENTALLY DETERMINED TO TAKE TWO-THIRDS OF THE CROP
DID SHE INTEND TO EXHIBIT
THIS TOO WAS THE TIME OF BIG CHURCH MEETINGS
THE TERROR OF THE SWAMP WAS UPON HIM
A KNOCKING CAME AT THE DOOR
SHE WANTED HER TO BE HANDSOME WELL DRESSED EARNEST AND GOOD
SHE'S TURNED--THERE'LL BE THE DEVIL TO PAY NOW A MESSENGER BURST IN AND TAYLOR SCOWLED
AND ABOVE ALL HIS PULPIT MANNER LOUD WILD AND STRONG
A SUGGESTION TO BLES THAT HE MIGHT PROFITABLY EXTEND HIS ACQUAINTANCE SENT HIM TO A CERTAIN TAILOR SHOP KEPT BY A FRIEND OF HERS
THE MARRIAGE MORNING 191 TWENTY-TWO
THEN SHE HANDED IT BACK
SHE HATED TO SEEM SO AND HAD FOR SOME TIME PRIDED HERSELF ON EMANCIPATION FROM NARROW NEW ENGLAND PREJUDICES
THEY TALKED LONG ABOUT THEIR FIRESIDES AND HERE ZORA BEGAN TO SIT AND LISTEN OFTEN SPEAKING A WORD HERSELF
ENOUGH--ENOUGH
SO IT WAS THE WEEK AFTER MARY TAYLOR'S RIDE THAT FOUND HIM AT CRESSWELL'S FRONT DOOR THIN EAGLE-EYED FAIRLY WELL DRESSED AND RADIATING CONFIDENCE
ARE YOU--IN A HURRY MISS SMITH HE ASKED
ONE LEG WAS SWATHED IN RAGS AND HIS EYES AS HE RAISED THEM WORE A COWED AND FURTIVE LOOK
SO AM I ADDED MRS VANDERPOOL SUPPRESSING A YAWN
HER INTERCOURSE WITH MISS SMITH WAS ONLY FORMAL BUT HER INTEREST IN ZORA'S WORK GREW
THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH WE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU AND THAT IS BY ENLIGHTENING YOU UPON POINTS CONCERNING WHICH THE NATURE OF YOUR POSITION--BOTH AS TEACHER AND SOCIALLY--MUST KEEP YOU IN THE DARK
WELL I'LL LET YOU KNOW HE SAID
JOHN TAYLOR LOOKED OUT ON THE PORCH TOO
IN TIME THEY WOULD GROW TO SWEET COMMUNION
SECOND THE BANKS AND WHOLESALE HOUSES IN THE SOUTH CAN CONTROL THE COTTON OUTPUT IF THEY WORK TOGETHER
AN LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS BIGGER'N COMMON CAUSE I HURT MY LEG WORKING AT THE GIN AND HAD TO HAVE SOME MEDICINE WHY AS FAR AS I CAN SEE MR SYKES YOU'VE PAID CRESSWELL ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS
COULD SHE BE BROUGHT BACK TO A USEFUL LIFE
POOR TODD HE MUSED
COLONEL CRESSWELL HE SAID I HAVE CHARGE OF THE BUYING FOR THE SCHOOL AND OUR TENANTS THIS YEAR AND I NATURALLY WANT TO DO THE BEST POSSIBLE
NO--WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU I WANT WORK--I'LL DO ANYTHING NO YOU'LL DO ONE THING--BE A CLERK AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF IN YOU YOU WILL THROW UP THAT JOB IN A YEAR AND START AGAIN I'D LIKE AT LEAST TO TRY IT SIR WELL I CAN'T HELP YOU MUCH THERE
COTTON SIR HARRY CRESSWELL BENT OVER IT
OH THAT DOESN'T CONCERN US TAYLOR
WHY ARE YOU DAFT
HE PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HER SHOULDERS AND MURMURED
SHE SAW THE TEARS THAT GATHERED BUT DID NOT FALL
HE'S GOING TO ELSPETH'S HE SAID
AND SHE SOMEHOW HAD ALWAYS COUNTED ON THE COURTESIES OF LIFE AS ADDED TO THEM MAKING THEM SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL
SHE HAD SAT SUDDENLY UPRIGHT
WHAT KIND OF A WOMAN WAS ZORA NOW
SHE ROSE TREMBLING AND LISTENED
HELP
I COULDN'T FIND THE WAY--AND I WANTED TO FORGET PEOPLE IN HELL DON'T FORGET WAS THE MATTER-OF-FACT COMMENT
IT WAS NOT A WORK TO HER LIKING BUT THE DIE WAS CAST AND SHE REFUSED TO CONTEMPLATE DEFEAT
BUT IT WILL NOT DO THE IMMEDIATE HARM THAT THE AMENDED CHILD LABOR BILL WILL DO WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED CRESSWELL FROWNING AGAIN
DELICIOUS
NEXT MORNING ZORA CAME EASILY INTO MRS VANDERPOOL'S LIFE
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS HERE SHE SAID SPEAKING COARSELY
SHE HAD SELDOM SEEN ELSPETH
COULD ANYTHING HAVE BEEN MORE THOUGHTFUL AND KNIGHTLY
YES AND THEN THERE'S MRS VANDERPOOL'S CHECK HOW MUCH IS THAT ZORA PAUSED
BUT OTHERS--A MAN'S A MAN ISN'T HE HE PERSISTED
SHE KNEW HOW PROUD COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS OF IT AND HOW DAILY HE HAD VISITORS TO SEE IT AND FINGER THE WIDE WHITE WOUND IN ITS SIDE
OH I DON'T KNOW REPLIED MR BOCOMBE
THERE WAS YOUNG CRESSWELL
ONE IS PAID FOR IT I WOULDN'T WORK FOR PAY BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO CHILD
THIS THING IS GOING TOO FAR
BUT MISS WYNN WAS PERVERSE AND INTERRUPTED
PERHAPS THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION
FIRST HE SAID GET AN INJUNCTION ON THE COTTON--THEN GO TO COURT AND TO INSURE THE MATTER HE SLIPPED OVER AND SAW THE JUDGE
SHE MUST BE JUST
ZORA QUIETLY CLOSED THE DOOR
THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SUDDEN UNSPOKEN FEAR OF FAILURE
SHE'S JUST MARRIED
WOULD UNCLE ISAAC HELP HER BUILD A LOG HOME
NO AUNTY THE CLERK WAS TELLING HER CALICO IS TOO HIGH
NO ONE COULD CROSS THE THRESHOLDS OF THE CABINS AND NOT SEE THE OLD AND WELL-KNOWN PROBLEMS OF LIFE AND STRIVING
IF HE HAD MRS VANDERPOOL WOULD HAVE MEANT LITTLE TO ALWYN--"'IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BY BLANK THAT THE FUTURE ALLEGIANCE OF THE NEGRO VOTE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MIGHT BE INSURED BY GIVING TO SOME PROMINENT NEGRO A HIGH POLITICAL POSITION--FOR INSTANCE TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES'--SALARY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS INTERPOLATED SENATOR SMITH--"'AND THAT ALWYN WOULD BE A POPULAR AND SAFE APPOINTMENT FOR THAT POSITION THE SENATOR DID NOT READ THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE WHICH RAN
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOMETHING MORE THAN GENERAL POLICY OR EVEN RACIAL PREJUDICE--SOMETHING PERSONAL--IN HIS VEHEMENCE
YET A VAST VISION SANK ON HER WEARY SPIRIT--THE VISION OF A DARK CLOUD THAT DROPPED AND DROPPED UPON HER AND LAY AS LEAD ALONG HER STRAINING SHOULDERS
A SUBTLE AIR AS OF ONE LOOKING FROM GREAT AND UNREACHABLE HEIGHTS DOWN ON THE DAWN OF THE WORLD
AND MOREOVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT ALTOGETHER ORDINARY
CRESSWELL FROWNED
DO YOU HEAR THE BODIES CREAKING ON THE LIMBS
THANK YOU SIR HE SAID
S'POSE IT SHOULDN'T COME UP AFTER ALL AND HE WOULD LAUGH AND SAY THAT OF COURSE IT WOULD COME UP
ZORA AND ALWYN GATHERED THEIR TENANTS CROPS GINNED THEM AT THE CRESSWELLS GIN AND CARRIED THEIR COTTON TO TOWN WHERE IT WAS DEPOSITED IN THE WAREHOUSE OF THE FARMERS LEAGUE
WITH PEACE AND CARE SHE WOULD FIND HERSELF FOR SHE IS STRONG
SHE GOSSIPED WITH OLD HERODOTUS ACROSS THE EARTH TO THE BLACK AND BLAMELESS ETHIOPIANS
YES MA'AM
SHE LET ME HAVE MY WAY AND ENCOURAGED THE BAD IN ME
SHE WAS STANDING STILL AND LISTENING WITH A HUGE BASKET OF THE PILED FROTH OF THE FIELD UPON HER HEAD
THEN CAME THE SURPRISE OF THE EVENING FOR BLES ALWYN
THE GOLDEN SUN WAS POURING FLOODS OF GLORY THROUGH THE SLIM BLACK TREES AND THE MYSTIC SOMBRE POOLS CAUGHT AND TOSSED BACK THE GLOW IN DARKER DULLER CRIMSON
NO MISS SMITH SANK INTO A CHAIR AND MOISTENED HER DRY LIPS
BEFORE THEM LAY A LONG ISLAND OPENING TO THE SOUTH ON THE BLACK LAKE BUT SHELTERED NORTH AND EAST BY THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH OF THE BLACK SWAMP AND THE RAMPART OF DEAD AND LIVING TREES
ALL HAD A GENERAL SENSE OF DILAPIDATION--SAVE ONE THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPOSING A THREE-STORY BRICK
ZORA SHOOK HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY
HAVE I PAID MY OLD DEBTS TO YOU
BENEATH THE CREAMY PILE OF THE OLD CAPITOL AND FACING THE NEW LIBRARY HE HAD STOOD ALOFT AND LOOKED DOWN ON A WAVING SEA OF FACES--BLACK-COATED JOSTLING EAGER-EYED FELLOW CREATURES
I HAVE CAME WITH MESSAGES FROM THE HOST TO YOU WHO GUARD THE MOUNTAIN TOPS APPARENTLY THEY WERE NOT DISCUSSING OR CARING ABOUT THE PROBLEM HE GREW DISGUSTED AND WAS EDGING TOWARD THE DOOR WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED HIS HOSTESS
CROPS WERE LAID BY AND PLANTING HAD NOT YET BEGUN
OH SHE UTTERED TWICE BUT WITH DIFFERENCE CADENCE
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE OFFICE THEN SHE SAW HIS FACE AND HESITATED
THE INCREASING SMELL OF TOBACCO SMOKE STARTED HER COUGHING
OF COURSE SAID MISS SMITH DRILY SLOWLY FOLDING HER NAPKIN OF COURSE THE ONLY PEOPLE HERE ARE THE CRESSWELLS OH YES SAID MISS TAYLOR INVITINGLY
FOR YEARS NOW TOM TEERSWELL HAD BEEN HER ESCORT
SOMETIMES I LIES SHE REFLECTED PENSIVELY AND SOMETIMES I DON'T--IT DEPENDS MISS TAYLOR FORGOT HER COLLAR AND FINGERED THE PIN ON THE DESK
I BEG YOUR PARDON HE TURNED AND STARTED
UP FROM THE GROUND OF THE DROWSY CITY ROSE PALE GRAY FORMS
THEN I'LL COME TOO ZORA ANNOUNCED POSITIVELY AND HE HAD TO PROMISE FOR HER SAKE TO REST
THERE WAS ANOTHER COLORED PORTER ON THIS AND HE WAS VERY POLITE AND AFFABLE
THE GIRL MOANED IN HER FITFUL SLEEP AND MISS SMITH SOOTHED HER
POVERTY--THAT WAS WHAT THOSE FIGURES SPELLED
HIS THREAT TO LET BLACKS AND WHITES WORK TOGETHER
THE ONLY WAY TO GET DECENT WORK OUT OF SOME NIGGERS IS TO LET THEM BELIEVE THEY'RE BUYING LAND
BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WHISKEY AND HARRY AT TIMES APPEARED TO BECOME JUST A BIT TOO LIVELY--NOTHING EXCESSIVE OF COURSE BUT HIS EYES AND THE SMELL AND THE COLOR WERE A LITTLE TOO SUGGESTIVE
AND LOVE WAS KING
YES YES INDEED
WE OUGHT TO BEAT THAT NIGGER UP BUT ZORA ASKED HIM ABOUT THE NEW BABY AND HE WAS SOON DEEP IN CHILD-LORE
THAT HAD BEEN SETTLED LONG SINCE--THERE WHERE THE TALL DARK PINES WAN WITH THE SHADES OF EVENING CAST THEIR HAUNTING SHADOWS ACROSS THE SILVER FLEECE AND HALF HID THE BLOOD-WASHED WEST
NO HOUSE THIS YEAR I FEAR QUOTH MR MAXWELL BITTERLY
IF HE DID MAKE THE SPEECH DEMANDED IT WOULD BE LIKE A DOG OBEDIENT TO HIS MASTER'S VOICE
SUPPOSE THIS WORLD WERE FULL YET OF THINGS SHE DID NOT KNOW NOR DREAM OF
OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND HESITATIONS OF CHILDHOOD THEY HAD STEPPED SUDDENLY INTO MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD WITH FIRM FEET AND UPLIFTED HEADS
THEY MAY ACCOMMODATE YOU--HOW MUCH WOULD YOU WANT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MISS SMITH REPLIED
OF COURSE AND THAT IS JUST WHAT MR CRESSWELL WANTS
IN THE WORLD LIES OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL HELP YOU ZORA ROSE ABRUPTLY AND MRS VANDERPOOL FEARED WITH A TIGHTENING OF HEART THAT SHE HAD LOST THIS STRANGELY ALLURING GIRL
THE ONLY THING THAT THREATENS IT IS CHILD-LABOR LEGISLATION IN THE SOUTH THE TARIFF AND THE CONTROL OF THE SUPPLY OF COTTON
THE LIABILITIES OF THE CRESSWELLS ALREADY AMOUNTED TO HALF THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY AT A FAIR MARKET VALUATION
HER HALF-SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AT THE SUDDEN DUTY OF WELCOMING THE GREAT ARISTOCRAT OF THE COUNTY GAVE A PIQUANCY TO HER PRETTINESS
A MIGHTY HALF-CONFESSED HALF-CONCEALED STRIVING FOR UNKNOWN THINGS
MR GREY THE TAILOR GAVE BLES SOME POINTS ON DRESSING AND MADE HIM SOUTHERN FASHION A FROCK-COAT FOR DRESS WEAR THAT SET OFF HIS FINE FIGURE
WHY SHOULD HE POSE AS BETTER THAN HIS FELLOWS
THEN YOU SEE ZORA IF YOU STAY HERE YOU'LL NEED A NEW HOUSE AND YOU'LL WANT TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL YES A BEAUTIFUL GREAT CASTLE HERE IN THE SWAMP SHE DREAMED
CRACK
ZORA HE SAID I WANT YOU TO DO ALL THIS--FOR ME I WILL IF YOU WANTS ME TO SHE SAID QUIETLY BUT WITH SOMETHING IN HER VOICE THAT MADE HIM LOOK HALF STARTLED INTO HER BEAUTIFUL EYES AND FEEL A QUEER FLUSHING IN HIS FACE
VAINLY HE STRUGGLED FOR THE WORD
HIS SMOOTH TONES STARTLED HER
BUT NOT LONG--NOT LONG
IN RETURN FOR THIS SHE WILL GRADUALLY LEARN TO SERVE AND SERVE LOYALLY
HE SUGGESTS AN EIGHTEEN-HUNDRED-DOLLAR CLERKSHIP FOR YOU THE SENATOR GLANCED UP KEENLY AND OMITTED TO STATE WHAT STILLINGS SUGGESTED FOR HIMSELF
THE COLONEL WAS STILL EXCITED
AND I'M GOING TO STOP THAT SCHOOL PUTTING NOTIONS INTO THEIR HEADS IN THREE SHORT MONTHS THE MILL AT TOOMSVILLE WAS OPEN AND ITS WHEELS WHIZZING TO THE BOUNDLESS PRIDE OF THE CITIZENS
ALTHOUGH JUST WHY A WOMAN SHOULD WANT TO GO THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INEXPLICABLE TO JOHN TAYLOR AND HE WAS STILL UNCERTAIN AS TO THE WISDOM OF HIS CHARITY
WELL TO BE BRIEF I'M ENGAGED TO MR STILLINGS WHAT
WAS THERE A CHANGE SUDDEN CATACLYSMIC
AND HARRY CRESSWELL LED HIS WIFE TO A LITTLE OASIS OF SOUTHERN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
SHE SAT IN A BACK SEAT AND SAW WITH UNSEEING EYES
FOR MANY DAYS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF WEALTH THE NEW DUTIES THE STREET SCENES AND THE CITY LIFE KEPT HIM MORE THAN BUSY
BUT WHAT OF THAT
BUT THE GODS OF LOWER BROADWAY THOUGHT OTHERWISE
WE ARE TO VISIT THE SCHOOL THIS MORNING YOU KNOW SHE REMINDED THE OTHERS LOOKING AT HER WATCH
I THINK THAT AS SOON AS I CAN MAKE UP MY MIND TO SPARE HER I'LL TAKE HER TO FRANCE AND MARRY HER OFF IN THE COLONIES WELL THAT'S POSSIBLE
WELL MR ALWYN WASHINGTON IS A BAD PLACE TO START IN THE WORLD BLES LOOKED SURPRISED AND INCREDULOUS
LYING ALONG THE EARTH LIKE HUGE BRONZE EARTH-SPIRITS SITTING AGAINST TREES CURLED IN DENSE BUSHES
BUT NOW NOW SOMEBODY ELSE WAS RECEIVING HIS GRATITUDE
WHO'S SPEAKING HE ASKED BLES AND BLES TOLD HIM
DARK FEAR SWEPT HER DRAWN FACE
A FEW HOURS LATER THE YOUNG PHYSICIAN ARRIVED HASTILY IN A CAB TO TAKE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO TOWN
IF THEY MUST APPOINT DARKIES WHY CAN'T THEY GET TRACTABLE ONES LIKE MY NIGGER STILLINGS STILLINGS SHE REPEATED
I KNEW THAT HIS APPOINTMENT WOULD COST YOU THE EMBASSY--UNLESS BLES WAS TEMPTED AND SHOULD FALL
TEN BANKS CONTROL THESE EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE--ONE OF THESE IS THE JEFFERSON NATIONAL OF MONTGOMERY OF WHICH YOU ARE A SILENT DIRECTOR COLONEL CRESSWELL STARTED
ARE YOU SURE OF THE PATH ZORA HE ONCE INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY
SHE TREMBLED AT ITS BEAUTY AND FELT A VAGUE INNER YEARNING AS IF SOME SUBTLE MAGIC OF THE WOVEN WEB WERE TRYING TO TELL HER ITS STORY
THE SUN BURNED IN THE HEAVENS
A LADY WITH GOLD BROWN FACE AND STRAIGHT HAIR STOOD BEFORE HER WITH PLEASANT SMILE
HE EVEN INJECTED A LITTLE GRUFFNESS INTO HIS TONE
OF COURSE I DON'T BELIEVE ALL THEIR TALK BUT I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW SHE TALKED A WHILE LONGER THEN FLUTTERED FURTIVELY AWAY
SHE'S ARRANGING FOR A BOARD OF TRUST ETC
MR ALWYN THE LINE BETWEEN VIRTUE AND FOOLISHNESS IS DIM AND WAVERING AND I SHOULD HATE TO SEE YOU LOST IN THAT MARSHY BORDERLAND
HE'D GO SEE HER AND PET HER A BIT BUT BE FIRM
SHE SAW THE DRUNKEN GOTHS REEL UPON ROME AND HEARD THE CARELESS NEGROES YODLE AS THEY GALLOPED TO TOOMSVILLE
ONE LEERED AT THE GIRL AND SHE LAUGHED BACK WHILE THE YELLOW BOY STRODE SULLENLY AHEAD
YES THERE WAS NEED OF A MANAGER FOR THE NEW FARM AND SETTLEMENT
BUT A CONTRASTING THOUGHT OF THE WHITE BED MADE HER TIMID AND SLOWLY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
THERE WHERE THE FIRST LONG NOTE OF NIGHT LAY SHOT WITH BURNING CRIMSON BURST IN SUDDEN RADIANCE THE WIDE BEAUTY OF THE MOON
MEASURED BY THE SQUAT CABIN SHE SEEMED IN HEIGHT COLOSSAL
BUT ABOUT THE PRICES SAID ALWYN FOLLOWING HIM
MIDWAY BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES LAY THE SALLOW PASTOR OF THE CHURCH THE CREAMY MISS WILLIAMS THE GOLDEN YELLOW OF MR TEERSWELL THE GOLDEN BROWN OF MISS JOHNSON AND THE VELVET BROWN OF MR GREY
VERY WELL SHE DECLARED HER DECISION AND THEY HANDED HER THE PRELIMINARY PAPERS
WELL YOU'RE BUSY YOU SEE
IN THE AFTERNOON BLES WENT TO TOWN WITH THE SCHOOL WAGON
NIGHT CAME SLOWLY AND SHE FELL TO DREAMING UNTIL THE CRY CAME CHARLOTTE
THEY COULD ONLY BLAME THE MILL FOR THEIR TROUBLES
ALWYN NOTICED NOTHING
IT WASN'T MAN AGAINST MAN OR HE WOULD HAVE DRAGGED THE PALE PUPPY FROM HIS HORSE AND RUBBED HIS FACE IN THE EARTH
AS MRS VANDERPOOL WENT IN TO LUNCH REACTION AND LINGERING DOUBTS CAME TROUPING BACK
HE WAS DEVELOPING INTO A MOST EFFECTIVE SPEAKER
THE SHERIFF HAS BEEN STIRRING UP THE WORST ELEMENTS IN THE TOWN LATELY AND THE MILLS PAY OFF TONIGHT WELL SHE SAID QUIETLY WE MUST PREPARE HE LOOKED AT HER HIS FACE AGLOW WITH ADMIRATION
THE CROP THROUGHOUT THE LAND WAS SHORT THAT YEAR FOR PRICES HAD RULED LOW LAST SEASON IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY OF THE COMBINE
THEY PLAYS
AND NOW I'M WONDERING WHETHER I HAVE A JEWEL OR--A WHITE ELEPHANT PROBABLY NEITHER REMARKED HARRY CRESSWELL DRILY
SAM STILLINGS BECAME HIS SHADOW
MRS VANDERPOOL LIKED THE SOUTH AND WAS AMUSED AT THE TRIP AND HAD INDUCED MR VANDERPOOL TO COME BY STORIES OF SHOOTING
TIS THY MARRIAGE MORNING SHINING IN THE SUN TWO WHITE AND WHITE-SWATHED BRIDES WERE COMING SLOWLY DOWN THE GREAT STAIRCASE OF CRESSWELL OAKS AND TWO WHITE AND BLACK-CLOTHED BRIDEGROOMS AWAITED THEM
HE WAS TALL THIN COLD AND TIRELESS AND HE MOVED AMONG THE WATCHERS OF THIS WORLD OF TRADE
HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF US--HE WORKS AND FOOLS US ALL NIGHT MISS SMITH HEARD MUTTERINGS OF THIS BITTERNESS AND THE NEXT DAY THE GIRL WALKED HER ROOM LIKE A TIGRESS,--TO AND FRO TO AND FRO ALL THE LONG DAY
GO LONG NOW--HIT AIN'T A THING THEN CAME A PAUSE THE OLD WOMAN SLIDING INTO THE PROFFERED SEAT WHILE OVER HER GENIAL DIMPLED SMILE THERE DROPPED A DULL VEIL OF CARE
CONTEMPT SLOWLY SUCCEEDED ANGER AND HOPE SOON TRIUMPHED OVER ALL
MEANTIME JOHN TAYLOR'S TROUBLES BEGAN TO INCREASE
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THOSE FINE BALES OF COTTON THAT CAME OUT OF THERE SEVERAL SEASONS AGO THE COLONEL SMOKED PLACIDLY
SHE'S PLANNING TO CALL SOME DAY--SHALL YOU BE AT HOME CERTAINLY NOT HARRY
HER DINNERS BECAME OF REAL POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND HER HUSBAND FIGURED MORE AND MORE AS A LEADING SOUTHERNER
WHAT A WONDERFUL CROP IT IS MARY HAD FALLEN PENSIVE
HIS LITTLE HORDE OF MONEY WAS TIGHTLY WADDED IN HIS SOCK AND THE SCHOOL LAY HIDDEN SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY IN THE SHADOWS
ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE-PLACE SAT THE YELLOW WOMAN YOUNG WITH TRACES OF BEAUTY HOLDING THE WHITE CHILD IN HER ARMS
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER GIFT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIS HOUSE AND PLANTATION
BLES WHERE WAS HE
ZORA SEWS BEAUTIFULLY ADDED MRS VANDERPOOL
HARRY CRESSWELL APPARENTLY HAD WRITTEN NOTHING HOME OF THEIR QUARREL
HE COULD HEAR HER NOW AND HEAR THAT WONDROUS SAVAGE MUSIC
IT TURNED OUT QUITE AS MISS WYNN HAD DESIGNED
MISS SMITH SLOWLY AROSE SHIVERING A BIT AND WONDERING WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE RAPPING AT THAT TIME IN THE MORNING
NO YOU WEREN'T EITHER INTERRUPTED HARRY WITH A LAUGH THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY
YET TODAY HE FROWNED AS HE STOOD POKING ABSENTLY WITH HIS CANE AT THE BALED FLEECE
BUT TO THE GIRL WHO STOOD AT THE END LOOKING OUTWARD TO DARKNESS THOSE ECHOES ROARED LIKE THE CRACK OF DOOM
WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE HIM ARRESTED FOR WHAT
WITH RAVENOUS APPETITES THE DARK HALF-FAMISHED THRONG FELL UPON THE FOOD AND THEN IN UTTER WEARINESS STRETCHED THEMSELVES AND SLEPT
THUS RINGED WITH FLAMING SILENCE THE SCHOOL LAY AT THE EDGE OF THE GREAT BLACK SWAMP AND WAITED
HE FELT THE MIDNIGHT EYES OF THE GIRL--HE SAW THE TWISTED OOZING MOUTH OF THE HAG BLUE-BLACK AND HIDEOUS
YES--YOU ARE SO DELIGHTFULLY PRIMITIVE
YET WHEN IT CAME--SOMEHOW IT FAILED TO STUN
THIS RAIN MIGHT STAY FOR DAYS
SHE WAS WHITE AND SILENT BUT SHE DID NOT TREMBLE
ZORA STARTED
ALL THE TRUTH SHE ASKED
I'LL EARN MINE SHE SAID
AND SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE BACK BEYOND HERSELF HER BETTER SELF LONGED TO FIND HERSELF DEFEATED
SHE WENT TO THE RACK AND TAKING HIS LONG HEAVY OVERCOAT SLIPPED IT ON
MOREOVER SHE ARGUED HE HAD NOT HAD A FAIR CHANCE
H'M--WELL,--SEE HERE SMITH WE MUST GO A LITTLE EASY THERE
NOT EXTREMELY COLORED BUT UNDOUBTEDLY COLORED WITH WAVING BLACK HAIR LIGHT BROWN SKIN AND THE FULLER FACIAL CURVING OF THE DARKER WORLD
SHE KNEW HOW THE GIN HAD BEEN CLEANED FOR ITS PRESSING AND HOW IT HAD BEEN BALED APART AND CAREFULLY COVERED
THE SMALLER BOY JUST SNORTED WITH IRREPRESSIBLE LAUGHTER AND BOLTED ACROSS THE FIELDS
HE WAS TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE NEW TRUST AND SUNDRY FAVORABLE MEASURES WERE ALREADY DRAFTED AND REPOSING IN THE SAFE OF THE COMBINE'S LEGAL DEPARTMENT
BUT I'M TIRED OF WAITING
BLES SLIPPED HIS ARM PROTECTINGLY AROUND ZORA GLANCING FEARFULLY ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS
HE DREW HER QUICKLY TO HIM IN FEAR AND THE COACH LURCHED AND TURNED AND LEFT THEM FACING FOUR PAIRS OF EYES
MARY TAYLOR LOOKED UP INTO ZORA'S FACE THEN PAUSED IN AWE
TIS THY MARRIAGE MORNING SHINING IN THE SUN UP FLOATED THE SONG OF THE LITTLE DARK-FACED CHILDREN AND ZORA LISTENED
BANG
BANG
BANG
BANG
BANG
BANG
BANG
SHE CAUGHT THE MAN'S SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE TALL WHITE PILLARS OF THE MANSION AND SHE FLED DEEPER INTO THE FOREST WITH THE HUSH OF DEATH ABOUT HER AND THE SILENCE WHICH IS ONE GREAT VOICE
THE NOISE OF PRAYER AND SINGING FILLED THE SABBATH DAWN
THE BOY FORGOT HIMSELF AND ALL THE WORLD BESIDES
COULD I BUY A LUNCH FROM THE DINING-CAR SHE INQUIRED
NOT VERY AND AS THEY MOVED TOWARD THE DINING-ROOM MARY CHANGED THE SUBJECT
SHE WAS RATHER TAKEN BACK THEREFORE TO BE REGARDED AS AN EXPERT ON THE PROBLEM
BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE THOUGHT IN THIS ROOM AND THAT'S GRAVE AND SERIOUS ENOUGH TO SUIT EVEN YOU AND QUITE YOUR DAILY TOPIC BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AH THERE'S THE RUB
I'M GOING TO MAKE CLOTH LIKE THAT RIGHT IN THIS COUNTY SOME DAY AND HE CHUCKLED GAYLY
AT EARLY DAWN WHEN THE MEN RELAXED FROM THE STRAIN OF THE NIGHT'S VIGIL ALWYN BRIEFLY COUNSELLED THEM
MISS--MISS SMITH SHE GASPED OVERWHELMED WITH DISMAY A PICTURE OF WOUNDED PRIDE AND CONSTERNATION
YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR FROM HER SOON
THE COLOR OF THE SCENE WAS WONDERFUL
SHE LOOKED SO ALOOF AND UNAPPROACHABLE SO HANDSOME AND SO ELEGANT
STILLINGS SEEMED WILLING TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE TIME TO HIM
ZORA HE GASPED HOW--HOW DID YOU DO IT SHE ONLY SMILED AND SANG A HAPPIER MEASURE PAUSING ONLY TO WHISPER
THEN FOR A MOMENT SHE GREW DIZZY AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WAS STANDING STILL AND THE SWAMP IN SOLEMN GRANDEUR MARCHING PAST--IN SOLEMN MOCKING GRANDEUR
THE WATERS ROARED AND GURGLED IN THE STREAMS AND ALONG THE ROADSIDE
NOT THE WILD LIGHT SONG OF DANCING FEET BUT A LOW SWEET MELODY OF HER FATHERS FATHERS WHEREUNTO ALWYN'S OWN DEEP VOICE FELL FITLY IN MINOR CADENCE
IN THOSE EYES LURKED THE TIRED LOOK OF THE BEWILDERED AND THE DISAPPOINTED
I PROPOSE GOING NORTH AND LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER THOROUGHLY
I SOMETIMES WISH SHE BEGAN AT LENGTH I HAD A BRIGHT-EYED GIRL LIKE YOU TO HELP ME FIND AND PLACE THINGS ZORA MADE NO COMMENT
I THANK YOU--GOOD-BYE SHE SAID BRIEFLY AT THE DOOR AND WAS GONE
IT'S A DAMNED LIE HE WHEELED ABOUT AND TORE INTO THE SWAMP
MARY TAYLOR FILLED HER LUNGS LIFTED HER ARMS ALOFT AND TURNING STEPPED INTO THE DEEP SHADOW OF THE SWAMP
OR IF THE SENATOR WAS BUSY HE WOULD MERELY SEND IN HIS CARD
THAT WAS WHAT THEY SPELLED
YOU POOR BRAVE CHILD AND SHE SHIVERED WITH JOY
THE YARD WAS ONE WIDE GREEN AND GOLDEN PLAY-GROUND AND ALL DAY THE MUSIC OF CHILDREN'S GLAD CROONING AND THE SINGING OF GIRLS WENT ECHOING AND TREMBLING THROUGH THE TREES AS THEY PLAYED AND SEWED AND WASHED AND WORKED
IF MARY CRESSWELL HAD ATTEMPTED LESS SHE WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE
THE PLANTING 74 TEN
WHAT ABOUT JOHNSON CALLS THE HEAD CLERK
YES I COULD LEAVE AND YOU WILL I DON'T KNOW BUT THE PLACE LOOKS--EVIL IT IS EVIL AND YET YOU WILL STAY ZORA'S EYES WERE NOW FIXED FAR ABOVE THE WOMAN'S HEAD AND SHE SAW A HUMAN FACE FORMING ITSELF IN THE VAST RAFTERS OF THE FOREST
JUST HOW SHE SENSED THIS MRS VANDERPOOL COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED NOR COULD ZORA
HE'S DRUNK AGAIN AND THEY SAY HE'S BEEN STEALING
I WONDER IF I'M SELLING MY BIRTHRIGHT FOR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASE OF DOUBT DO IT BUT THERE'S THE DOUBT
IF HE'S BLUFFING OR THE THING LOOKS WEAK WE'LL WAIT IT ALL ENDED AS MATTERS USUALLY DID END IN HARRY'S HAVING HIS WAY
HERE WAS HER MOST HAUNTING FAILURE THIS GIRL WHOM SHE FIRST HAD SEEN TWELVE YEARS AGO IN HER WONDERFUL GIRLISH COMELINESS
HE WAS FOOLISHLY GLAD TO SEE THE FORMER CRESSWELL BUTLER WHOM HE HAD KNOWN BUT SLIGHTLY
THIS HE ANNOUNCED QUIETLY IS FROM A MAN OF GREAT POWER AND INFLUENCE WHO HAS THE EAR OF THE NEW PRESIDENT HE SMOOTHED OUT THE LETTER PAUSED BRIEFLY THEN READ ALOUD
GRADUALLY AS HE BECAME USED TO THE OFFICE ROUTINE AND IN THE HOURS WHEN HE WAS WEARY OF STUDY HE BEGAN TO FIND TIME HANGING A LITTLE HEAVILY ON HIS HANDS
SOON SHE WAS AWARE THAT SCHOOL HAD BEEN DISMISSED AND SHE LEISURELY GATHERED UP HER BOOKS AND ROSE
WHY I HAD A COLORED SERVANT-GIRL ONCE LAUGHED MRS VANDERPOOL BY WAY OF CLIMAX WHO SPENT HALF HER WAGES IN PIANO LESSONS THEN MARY TAYLOR WHOSE CONSCIENCE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE SAID
GOOD CROPS EVEN FOR TWO YEARS WOULD LEAVE US FAIRLY WELL OFF YOU MEAN IT WOULD RELIEVE YOU OF THE PRESENT STRINGENCY AND PUT YOU FACE TO FACE WITH THE FALLING PRICE OF COTTON AND RISING WAGES WAS JOHN TAYLOR'S DRY ADDENDUM
IT'S A CINCH ARE YOU SURE TAYLOR SURVEYED HIM WITH A NARROWED LOOK
HERE STOOD A BLACK MAN WITH A WHITE MAN'S VOICE AND YONDER A WHITE WOMAN WITH A NEGRO'S MUSICAL CADENCES
MISS SMITH LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE
THIS WAS THE ATONEMENT FOR THE UNFORGIVEN SIN
THE CRIMSON LIGHT FELL FULL UPON THE WARM AND VELVET BRONZE OF HER FACE--HER MIDNIGHT EYES WERE AGLOW HER FULL PURPLE LIPS APART HER HALF HID BOSOM PANTING AND ALL THE MUSIC DEAD
GO DOWN TO PHARAOH AND SMITE HIM IN GOD'S NAME
HE PAUSED FOR NEITHER PATH NOR WAY BUT WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE SCHOOL RUNNING IN MIGHTY STRIDES YET GENTLY LISTENING TO THE MOANS THAT STRUCK DEATH UPON HIS HEART
BLES SHE CALLED FAINTLY BUT DID NOT TURN HER HEAD
WELL NIGGER WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT HE GROWLED INSOLENTLY
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THERE WAS LOTS TO LEARN HE ASKED ONCE
THE CASTE WAY OF THINKING IN THE SOUTH BOTH AS APPLIED TO POOR WHITES AND TO NEGROES HE SIMPLY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED
UNITE AND KEEP BLES WAS PUZZLED
WHY HELLO SAM
THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE ELSE HERE TO CONFIDE IN
DON'T LET THE BLACKS MEDDLE IN POLITICS SAID DR BOLDISH
SHE CAME THUS INTO THE ROOM WHERE SAT MISS SMITH STRANGELY PALLID BENEATH HER DUSKY SKIN
HE AND HARRY WERE BOTH EYING THE GIRL INTENTLY
THESE CONCLUSIONS SHE DID NOT PRETEND TO HAVE ORIGINATED
ALL OF WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE THE CALLER'S APPRAISING INSPECTION
ON THE RIGHT WAS A BROAD VERANDAH LOOKING TOWARD A WIDE LAWN WITH THE MAIN ROAD AND THE RED SWAMP IN THE DISTANCE
SHE REQUIRED HIM TO WAIT ON HER QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE--TO ADJUST HER PILLOWS HAND HER THE BON-BONS AND HUNT FOR HER LOST FAN
PERHAPS NO ONE WHO HAD NOT KNOWN THE CHILD AND THE GIRL AS HE HAD WOULD HAVE NOTED ALL THIS
SHE'S JILTED ME--AND I--AND I I DON'T SEE AS IT'S ALL UP YET STILLINGS TRIED TO REASSURE HIM
WHY WORRY WITH MORE MR EASTERLY HALF EXPECTED THIS AND HE DETERMINED TO DELIVER HIS LAST SHOT ON THE RUN
WELL ZORA WHAT HAVE YOU THERE HE ASKED
LOOKING DOWN INTO HER SOUL ZORA DISCERNED ITS INNOCENCE AND THE FRIGHT SHINING IN THE CHILD'S EYES
THE HAND OF ELSPETH WAS REACHING FROM THE GRAVE TO PULL HER BACK
BUT AT LAST SHE WAS SURE THAT BEYOND CHANCE AND WOMANHOOD IT WAS THE COLORLINE THAT WAS HEMMING HER IN
SOME WHITE AND SHAVEN AND STIFF
YES MA'AM SHE FINALLY REPLIED
VERY WELL HE ACQUIESCED AS HE PASSED SLOWLY OUT
SHE LOOKED AGAIN AT HER MEMORANDUM AND AT THE HOUSE
BLES WAS THINKING
HE UNBUTTONED HIS COLLAR THAT HE MIGHT GET MORE AIR
YET SOMEHOW THE STRUGGLE THEN WITH ALL ITS HELPLESSNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT HAD NOT SEEMED SO BITTER AS TODAY
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO LATE
IT'S YOURS CARRIE
THIS IS THE END HE HURLED THE THOUGHT ASIDE AND CRASHED THROUGH THE BARRIER
BUT I WAS BORN IN FIRE
HE THOUGHT A WHILE
SHE HATED IT AND DESPISED IT BUT HER PRIDE WAS IN ARMS AND HER ONE GREAT LIFE FRIENDSHIP IN THE BALANCE
DO YOU KNOW MY PEOPLE
SHE STOOD UNCERTAINLY AND LOOKED AT THE OPENING AND CLOSING DOOR
BE JOYFUL
WE'VE CORNERED THE MARKET ALL RIGHT--CORNERED IT--D'YE HEAR CRESSWELL
HAD YOU HEARD MR TAYLOR SAID HE HAD HEARD AND HE HURRIED ON
THEN THE VAST WELTER OF HUMANITY DISSOLVED AND STREAMED HITHER AND THITHER GAPING AND LAUGHING UNTIL NIGHT WHEN THOUSANDS POURED INTO THE RED BARN OF THE CENSUS SHACK AND ENTERED THE ARTIFICIAL FAIRYLAND WITHIN
OF BALZAC AND HER OWN DUMAS
HE KNEW WHERE SHE WAS--WHERE SHE MUST BE WAITING
BUT HOW SHALL WE HELP HIM MAKE HIM TREASURER OF THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT SACRIFICING HIS MANHOOD OR BETRAYING HIS PEOPLE I CAN DO THAT SAID MRS VANDERPOOL SLOWLY
SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT BEFORE HE SAID SLOWLY
THIS MAN WAS STARTLINGLY DIFFERENT
SEEKING SOCIAL EQUALITY HATING WHITE PEOPLE AND SCHEMING TO MAKE TROUBLE
TODAY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE ZORA SENSED THE VAST UNORGANIZED POWER IN THIS MASS AND HER MIND WAS LEAPING HERE AND THERE SCHEMING AND TESTING WHEN VOICES ARRESTED HER
A NEW SONG WAS RISING ON THE AIR
EASTERLY'S RIGHT HE BEAMED THE STOCK OF THE COTTON COMBINE HE PAUSED AT THE SILENCE AND LOOKED UP
THE MERE MENTION OF THE THING WAS TO HER SO PREPOSTEROUS--NO LOATHSOME SHE KEPT REPEATING
CONGRESSMEN TODD URGED MRS CRESSWELL TO STAY AFTER THE DISCUSSION AND ATTEND A MEETING OF THE MANAGERS AND WORKERS OF THE WASHINGTON SOCIAL SETTLEMENTS
THE THING I'M AFRAID OF HE SAID IS THAT CRESSWELL AND HIS GANG WILL SWING IN THE NIGGERS ON US HOW DO YOU MEAN LET EM VOTE BUT THEY'D HAVE TO READ AND WRITE SURE WELL THEN SAID TAYLOR IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING COLTON EYED HIM SUSPICIOUSLY
WELL ALL HER CLOTHES HAVE ARRIVED OR REMAINED AT A SIMPLICITY AND VIVIDNESS THAT IS--WELL--IMMODEST DOES SHE THINK THEM IMMODEST WHAT SHE THINKS IS A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM YOU MEAN WELL YES THEY PAUSED A MOMENT
MISS SMITH HE GASPED AND THEN--DARKNESS
WHAT A MARVELLOUS FIELD
WE MUST DRIVE THEM MORE
THEY KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT OR WE SQUEEZE EM AND BUY THE LAND
SLOWLY INTERMITTENTLY THE MURMURING SWELLED TILL IT GREW DISTINGUISHABLE AS YELLING CURSING AND SINGING INTERMINGLED WITH THE CRASH OF PISTOL-SHOTS
BUT TONIGHT AFTER SCHOOL WHEN HE MET HER ON THE BIG ROAD WITH THE CLOTHES SHE WOULD TAKE HIM AND SHOW HIM THE CHOSEN SPOT
THE PAPER IN MRS VANDERPOOL'S HANDS FELL QUICKLY TO HER LAP AND SHE GAZED ACROSS THE TOILET-TABLE
AS HE CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR THERE SEEMED TO COME FAINTLY UP FROM THE SWAMP A LOW ULULATION LIKE THE PROLONGED CRY OF SOME WILD BIRD OR THE WAIL OF ONE'S MOURNING FOR HIS DEAD
I KNOW SENATOR SMITH BUT SLIGHTLY BUT I DO KNOW HIS SISTER WELL DROPPING TO SIMPLE NARRATIVE HE TOLD OF MISS SMITH AND OF HIS COMING TO SCHOOL
YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BRONZES ASKED MRS VANDERPOOL
I SIMPLY LISTENED WELL THERE WAS NO HARM IN THAT
ONE NEVER KNEW
NAUGHTY NAUGHTY BRER RABBIT AND THEN SHE WOULD SHOW IT WHERE SHE HAD GATHERED PILES OF FRAGRANT WEEDS FOR IT AND ITS FELLOWS
AND NOW WHEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD SHE WOULD SEE THE WOMAN WHO WAS TO MARRY BLES ALWYN
AND THEN BRIGHTENING HE ASKED GAYLY
HAD MRS STILLINGS HEARD OF THE NEW ART MOVEMENT
BUT THE OTHER GOWN WHERE IS IT ASKED THE DRESSMAKER LOOKING ABOUT
HE WOULD HELP
ALL RIGHT A HORROR CREPT OVER MARY CRESSWELL
SOME HAD CAUGHT KINDLED AND FLASHED TO AMBITION AND ACHIEVEMENT
SHE MURMURED A QUICK WORD AND STOOD STRAIGHT AND TALL WITH HER EYES SQUARELY ON THE LADY
COME LET'S GO THEY TROOPED NOISILY DOWN-STAIRS AND CRESSWELL WALKED UNCEREMONIOUSLY BETWEEN A BLACK MAN AND HIS PARTNER
THE BOY'S EYES FOLLOWED HIM AS HE WHIPPED UP THE HORSE
I KNEW HOW I'D HAVE TO EXPLAIN AND PLEAD AND I JUST COULD NOT
NO BLES--NO--ALL GIRLS DO NOT KNOW
IT CANNOT END LIKE THIS
HE JOKED AND WRESTLED WITH THE PORTER AND ON EVERY OCCASION PUSHED HIS WARES AT ZORA INSISTING ON HER BUYING
I LIVE--I LOVE
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CALL LATER
COMMITTEE WON'T MEET TONIGHT HARRY SO
MISS SMITH SHE SAID
WE'SE KNOWN US ALL OUR LIVES AND--BEFORE AIN'T WE HE HESITATED
WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WHAT HAD HAPPENED
PERHAPS THE WOMAN WAS A DOMESTIC
COME ON HONEY SHE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND GRIPPED HIS HAND AS ONE DROWNING GRIPS ANYTHING OFFERED--GRIPPED TILL HE WINCED
THE NIGGERS NEED A LESSON HE MUTTERED AS HE UNSTEADILY BADE HIS HOST GOOD-BYE
NO SOONER IN THIS BRIEF MOMENT DID SHE SEE HERSELF HONESTLY THAN HER OLD HABITS SWEPT HER ON TUMULTUOUSLY
BUT ZORA WAS LOOKING AT HER CALMLY AGAIN
THEN HER FACE CLOUDED
IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT THEY MARCHED NOISILY THROUGH THE STREETS
DURNED IF I DON'T THINK THESE WHITE SLAVES AND BLACK SLAVES HAD OUGHT TER GIT TOGETHER SHE DECLARED
HO
ZORA LOOKED IT OVER LEISURELY AND TRIED IT ON
SHE DID NOT BELIEVE IT
SHE REMEMBERED THAT BEYOND THIS LITTLE WORLD IT STRETCHED ON AND ON--HOW FAR SHE DID NOT KNOW--BUT ON AND ON IN A GREAT TREMBLING SEA AND THE FOAM OF ITS MIGHTY WATERS WOULD ONE TIME FLOOD THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
IN HER FINGERS FLUTTERED A CHECK FOR--_TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY THAT THE TWO WOMEN WERE SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO TALK MATTERS OVER SANELY
HER SKIN WAS CLEAR AND HEALTHY AND HER WHITE DRESS--HAPPY COINCIDENCE!--HAD BEEN LAUNDERED THAT VERY MORNING
DE DEBBILS WHAT FORGITS GOD HELP HIM LORD CRIED THE MULTITUDE
WHAT WAS HE TO HER
EVIDENTLY THE SENATOR WAS BUSY FOR HIS WAITING-ROOM WAS FULL
IT SAVORED GROSSLY OF BARGAIN AND SALE
MOST OF THESE WHITE FOLK--BELIEVE ME BOY SHE SAID CARESSINGLY,--"ARE FOOLS AND KNAVES
THE PRESIDENT WALKED THROUGH SMILING
IN THE FALL HARRY CRESSWELL WAS DECLARED ELECTED
HE SPENT NO COURTESY ON THE NIGGER TEACHER BUT SAT IN HIS SADDLE AND CALLED HER TO THE GATE AND SHE WENT
WHAT CAN I DO SWEAR THAT CRESSWELL DIDN'T MEAN TO SIGN THIS SAID THE LAWYER QUICKLY AS HE AROSE TO ADDRESS THE COURT
SHE HAD NOT DREAMED THE TOLLIVER PLACE WAS FOR SALE
WITH A STRUGGLING AND TEARING IN HIS THROAT HE TRIPPED AND FELL FAINTING UNDER THE SILENT OAKS
IT WAS A MESALLIANCE OF A SORT THAT PRICKED HIM TENDERLY
AH MR ALWYN HE SAID AFFABLY
HE RECEIVED HER KISS COLDLY AND MARY'S HEART SANK
MISS SMITH STILL SYSTEMATICALLY SNUBBED HIM WHEN HE BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF ZORA
SHE PAUSED IN SUDDEN CERTAINTY THAT THERE LAY THE ANSWER TO HER DOUBTS AND MISTRUST
AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF HER WORDS
COLONEL CRESSWELL INSPECTED ALL THE CROPS DAILY WITH A PROPRIETARY AIR THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NATURAL HAD THESE FOLK BEEN SIMPLY TENANTS AND AS SUCH HE PERSISTED IN REGARDING THEM
SHE SLOWLY UNDRESSED IN THE DARK AND HEARD THE RUMBLING OF THE COTTON WAGONS AS THEY SWAYED TOWARD TOWN
INDEED IT WAS HIS OWN QUIET SUGGESTION THAT MADE JOHN TAYLOR HURRY MATTERS
I'M SO GLAD
AND YET WHY SHOULD SHE HESITATE
SLIM STRAIGHT AS A PINE MOTIONLESS WITH ONE LONG OUTSTRETCHED ARM POINTING TO WHERE THE PATH SWEPT ONWARD TOWARD THE TOWN
PLANNING TO CIRCLE AROUND THEM DRAWING HIS NETS CLOSER AND TRYING THEM AGAIN LATER
BANG AGAIN WENT THE HARD KNUCKLES DOWN THERE AT THE FRONT
HE WAS TALL AND BIG AND STRONG AS ANYTHING AND WHEN HE SPOKE THE TREES SHOOK AND THE STARS FELL
HER HOME WAS OUT OF DOORS THE CABIN OF ELSPETH HER PORT OF CALL FOR TALKING AND EATING
STILLINGS TOLD HIM
HE WENT BACK TO HIS WORK BUT EARLY IN THE MORNING THE THOUGHT OF IT LURED HIM AGAIN
OPPOSITE HER TO THE SOUTHWARD BUT TOO FAR FOR SIGHT AN OLD MAN CAME OUT OF THE LOWER CRESSWELL PLACE SKIRTING THE SWAMP
SHE SPED AT LAST THROUGH THE OAKS UP THE TERRACES AND SLOWING DOWN TO AN UNSTEADY WALK STAGGERED INTO THE HOUSE
OVER THE DEAD SHE SPREAD A CLEAN WHITE SHEET
WHO IS HE HE ASKED
WHY YES--THAT IS I LIKE SOME KINDS OF WORK WHAT KINDS BUT MISS TAYLOR REFUSED TO HAVE THE MATTER MADE PERSONAL AS ZORA HAD A DISCONCERTING WAY OF POINTING ALL THEIR DISCUSSIONS
HE MEANT TO BE ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT SOME DAY
WHAT MISS WYNN SAID TO HERSELF
THEY SEEMED TO KNOW PEOPLE INTIMATELY WHO LIVED FAR AWAY
ALL TO THEM ARE EITHER IMPOSSIBLE ZORAS OR ELSE LOVABLE BLESSINGS
HE KEPT THINKING WHAT A MISTRESS OF A MANSION SHE WOULD MAKE
WHERE TO MADAME ASKED THE CHAUFFEUR
I HATE TO LEAVE YOU BUT--IT CALLS MRS VANDERPOOL HELD THE DARK GIRL CLOSE AND BEGAN CRAFTILY
THE CHILD ON THE BED TURNED ITSELF MURMURING UNEASILY IN ITS DREAMS
THEN TOO CORNERING THE COTTON MARKET HERE MEANS THE WHIP-HAND OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD
A DOZEN HANDS CLAPPED A DEVIL'S TATTOO
AND WHEN HE REPORTED FOR WORK HIS CHIEF AND FELLOW CLERKS TOOK UNUSUAL INTEREST IN HIM
I WAS SO AFRAID HE WOULD MISS IT AND THINK THAT RIGHT DIDN'T WIN IN LIFE THAT I WROTE HIM YOU WROTE HIM
CRESSWELL HAD WORKED CAREFULLY AND WITH CAUTION
HER CABIN BECAME A RENDEZVOUS FOR DRINKING AND CAROUSING
THERE WAS NO PRIDE OF ACHIEVEMENT IN HER MANNER NO GLADNESS
SEND IT SHE COUNSELED WITH STRANGELY CONTRADICTORY FEELINGS OF ENTHUSIASM AND ADDED
I WONDER WHERE
ALL THIS IN TURN--BUT NOW AND FIRST THE INNOCENT GIRLHOOD OF THIS DAUGHTER OF SHAME MUST BE RESCUED FROM THE DEVIL
THE PROSPECTS SEEMED MOST ALLURING
NEVER FEAR
HE HAD NOT SEEN HER FALTER YET BENEATH HIS GLANCES OR TREMBLE AT HIS TOUCH
SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAN FROTH IN THE TALK OF A BOLT IN THE NORTHERN NEGRO VOTE
CAME AND GATHERED THE FRAIL AND WHITE-HAIRED WOMAN IN HER ARMS
OF COURSE HE CONCEDED THEY'LL EVENTUALLY GET TOGETHER
HE GULPED IN DESPAIRING ANGER AND HIT THE STAID OLD HORSE THE SMARTEST TAP SHE HAD KNOWN ALL SUMMER
OF COURSE THE COLORED PEOPLE HAD THEIR OWN BALL
CERTAINLY I'LL FETCH YOU A LUNCH--PLENTY OF TIME AND HE DID
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO SEE SENATOR SMITH ABOUT HAVE YOU HAD THE CIVIL-SERVICE EXAMINATIONS YES
SHE WAS WORKING
SHE ESSAYED SOME GAY GREETING BUT HE INTERRUPTED HER
THEN TURNING HE REMINDED THEM OF THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY
AND LAYING ASIDE HER BOOK SHE WAITED WITH A MARKED CURIOSITY
IT'S THE NIGGERS
COURT'S JUST OUT PURSUED MR CALDWELL AND THEM NIGGERS HAVE JUST BEEN SENT TO THE GANG--YOUNG ONES TOO
QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY HER CYNICISM CREPT TO THE FORE UNTIL IN WORD AND TONE SHE HAD ALMOST SCOFFED AT MANY THINGS THAT ALWYN HELD TRUE AND DEAR
YET INVOLUNTARILY THEIR HANDS FELL APART
A JAGGED STONE IN THE BOY'S HAND STRUCK TRUE AND THE OVERSEER PLUNGED WITH A GRUNT INTO THE BLACK FURROW
BUT THEY KNOW THINGS THAT GIVE THEM POWER AND WEALTH AND MAKE THEM RULE NO NO
SHE WAS SUDDENLY ALIVE FROM HAIR TO FINGER TIP
HARRY SHE PLEADED JUST THIS ONCE--FOR ME HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF HALF IMPATIENTLY AND ROSE GLANCING AT THE CLOCK
THE RIOT OF THIRST AND THE ORGIES OF SUCH RED AND BLACK CABINS AS ELSPETH'S CROUCHING IN THE SWAMP
CONVENTIONAL BUT GRACEFUL IN DRESS
THE CHILD FURTIVELY UNCOVERED HER FACE AND LOOKED AT THE STRANGER
WE SAUNTER TO IT SIDEWAYS TOUCH IT DELICATELY BECAUSE"--HER FACE BECAME A LITTLE GRAVER--"BECAUSE YOU SEE IT HURTS BLES STOOD THOUGHTFUL AND ABASHED
NEITHER PERHAPS REALIZED YET THAT THIS WAS LOVE BUT IT NEEDED MRS CRESSWELL WAS SURE ONLY THE LIGHTNING-FLASH AND THEY WOULD KNOW
THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF SAM STILLINGS AND SENT FOR HIM
YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED OUR LANGUAGE YET
SO MUCH MUST MEAN SOMETHING SHE PROTESTED
SOUTHERN COUNTRY NEGROES WERE RARE IN HER SET BUT HERE WAS A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE AND KEENNESS COUPLED WITH AN AMAZING FRANKNESS AND MODESTY AND PERCEPTIBLY SHADOWED BY SORROW
HE MENTIONED ONE OR TWO BITS OF NEWS FROM THE PAPER UPON WHICH SHE COMMENTED WHILE DAWDLING OVER HER EGG
THE NEGROES ARE SWEET ON YOU AND HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU KNOW
THE DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO DELIVER THIS COTTON TO ZORA CRESSWELL HE DIRECTED
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT ANY ONE CAN ADVISE A BLACK MAN TO VOTE THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET AN ELDERLY MAN TURNED TO THEM
I'M GOING TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN RIGHT HERE
AT LAST ALL WAS STILL
ANIMATED IN MOVEMENT
THE CHILD SLEPT ON
YOU ARE HERE AT WASHINGTON WITH THESE NEGRO OFFICE-HOLDERS AT YOUR BACK
SHE LISTENED BENDING FORWARD HER EYES GLUED TO THE SPEAKER'S LIPS AND LETTING NO WORD DROP
THE DEFT QUIET BUTLER BROUGHT OUT A LITTLE TABLE SPREAD WITH THE WHITEST OF CLOTHS AND LAID WITH THE BRIGHTEST OF SILVER AND FOUND A DAINTY LUNCH
SHE PUSHED HER BONNET BACK
I HAVE NONE RETURNED ZORA RISING
OH THESE PEOPLE
NO HE SAID STURDILY
VERY SHIFTLESS--AND THAT SINGING
CRESSWELL GLANCED UP QUIZZICALLY AT MISS TAYLOR
JOHN TAYLOR CUT IN SHARPLY
THE EVENING PASSED VERY PLEASANTLY
IT SEEMED VERY NATURAL
CANDIDLY COLTON HE CONCLUDED I BELIEVE IN ARISTOCRACY
MY PARENTS DID SHE SAID SIMPLY
THESE ARE THE TWO BALES YOU SENT ME WOVEN WITH A SILK WOOF NO ONE PARTICULARLY NOTICED THAT ZORA HAD HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM
SHE GLIMPSED ALL THIS WITH PARTED LIPS AND THEN SIGHED IMPATIENTLY
I MEAN WHAT WORK WORK
UNLESS RELIEF COMES SOMEHOW--WELL WE'LL JUST HAVE TO QUIT
THIS COUNTY YOU KNOW IS MOSTLY BLACK MRS GREY DID NOT CATCH THE POINT
A WONDER IN HIS
SHE WISHED NEITHER FOOD NOR WORDS ONLY TO BE ALONE
HARRY CRESSWELL WAS NOT A BAD MAN--ARE THERE ANY BAD MEN
IS IT FAIR--TO THE CHILDREN YES IT IS HE CRIED VEHEMENTLY
EMMA
HE THOUGHT OF ZORA TELLING HOW SHE STAYED OUT NIGHTS
AS MISS SMITH KNELT BESIDE HER ONE NIGHT TO MAKE HER SIMPLE PRAYER ZORA SAT SUDDENLY UPRIGHT WHITE-SWATHED DISHEVELLED WITH FURY IN HER MIDNIGHT EYES
MRS VANDERPOOL LOOKED UP QUICKLY
I WOULDN'T RECKON IT AS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS INSISTED THE COLONEL
IT WAS DARK WHEN THE COTTON CAME
I'LL MAKE ELSPETH TAKE THAT GIRL OUT OF SCHOOL IF I HAVE TO HORSE-WHIP HER AND I'LL WARN THE SCHOOL AGAINST FURTHER INTERFERENCE WITH OUR TENANTS
DON'T YOU SEE HE SAID ANGRILY THAT THAT WILL RUIN OUR PLANS FOR THE COTTON COMBINE YES I DO REPLIED SMITH
NOT FLAMBOYANT AND DECLAMATORY BUT TENSE STACCATO POINTED
SHE WAS PROPOSING TO HIM A PLAN OF WIDE SCOPE--A BOLD REGENERATION OF THE LAND
BUT JOHN TAYLOR WAS NOT THE MAN TO WAIT WEEKS WHEN A PURPOSE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS OR HOURS
DO YOU KNOW SHE PURSUED I'M A LITTLE AFRAID OF ONE THING SO AM I OH YOU'VE NOTED IT TOO?--HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THAT IMPOSSIBLE GIRL ZORA MISS SMITH GAVE HER A SEARCHING LOOK
WE CAN'T KEEP A MAID OR A PLOUGH-BOY ON THE PLACE BECAUSE OF THIS DEVILISH SCHOOL
SHE DID NOT ANTICIPATE ANY IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING WITH THE LABORING WHITES BUT SHE KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY IT WOULD BE INEVITABLE
WE CONTROL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS OF THAT CAPITALIZATION
A TREMOR SHIVERED IN HIS LIMBS AS HE STARED DARKLY AT THE SWAMP
WELL YOU SEE MISS TAYLOR IT'S LIKE THIS
THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-TWO VOTES CAST BUT THE SHERIFF ADDED A CIPHER
WHO'S THAT THUNDERED THE COLONEL MORE ANGRY AT HIS INVOLUNTARY FRIGHT THAN AT THE INTRUSION
WITHIN THE CABIN ELSPETH HEARD
DRAWING HER SHAWL ABOUT HER SHE HURRIED DOWN THE HIGHWAY
I BELIEVE IN YOU
HE SAT DOWN HEAVILY IN THE CHAIR OPPOSITE AND TRIED QUIETLY TO REGAIN HIS SELF-CONTROL
CAN'T I HAVE THE GIRL ZORA MRS VANDERPOOL AT LAST INQUIRED
SHE WAS A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY-THREE FAIR AND RATHER DAINTILY MOULDED
IT WAS AN OLD SQUARE BRICK-AND-STUCCO BUILDING SOMBRE AND STILTED AND VERY DIRTY
IN FACT AN HONEST MAN IN POLITICS EVEN IF HE IS BLACK PIQUES MY CURIOSITY
CONTENTS THE QUEST OF THE SILVER FLEECE NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR 3 ONE
I DON'T SMOKE SAID BLES APOLOGETICALLY
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE THE CRESSWELLS SHE ASKED
HE NOT ONLY HAD A STRONG PERSONAL DISLIKE FOR ALWYN BUT HE REGARDED THE PROMISE TO HIM OF A HIGH OFFICE AS A MENACE TO THE SOUTH
THE MEN WILL BE CHEATED AND THE WOMEN ZORA PAUSED AND HER EYES GREW HARD
BUT NOW I SEE
THE NORTH IS NO PLACE FOR NIGGERS
I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE CRESSWELLS WOULD BE DELIGHTED AND WITH THE TEACHERS OF IT WHY NOT?--PROVIDED OF COURSE THEY WERE--WELL GENTLEFOLK AND ASSOCIATED ACCORDINGLY BUT ONE MUST ASSOCIATE WITH ONE'S PUPILS OH CERTAINLY CERTAINLY
A BODY OF PEACEFUL WHITES PASSING THROUGH THE BLACK SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FIRED ON FROM AMBUSH AND SIX KILLED--NO THREE KILLED--NO ONE KILLED AND TWO SEVERELY WOUNDED
THE MAN NOTED THE NAME AND WENT QUIETLY OUT
BUT HE HAD HOPED FOR A CRASH EVEN EARLIER
THIS POLICEMAN'S BUSINESS WAS TO KEEP BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN THEIR PLACES
THIRD WATCH THE SOUTHERN FARMERS LEAGUE OF BIG LANDLORDS MR EASTERLY THREW AWAY HIS CIGAR AND SAT DOWN
HE REGARDS ITS PASSAGE AS A SORT OF VINDICATION OF HIS DEFENCE OF THE PARTY YES NOW THE PARTY HAS DROPPED THE BILL FOR GOOD AND ALWYN DOESN'T LIKE IT
WE BUY OUR STOCK ON TIME AND YOU CAN JUST AS WELL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AS NOT
EVEN COLONEL CRESSWELL EXPANDED UNDER THE GENIAL INFLUENCES AND WHILE HIS HEAD STILL PROTESTED HIS HEART WAS GLAD
THE HALF MOCKING ANSWER THAT ROSE INVOLUNTARILY TO HER LIPS WAS CHECKED
THE SCHOOL
BUT I STILL--BELIEVE IN THE WORLD YOU ARE YOUNG YET MY FRIEND SHE LIGHTLY REPLIED
SPLENDID DRAUGHTSMAN A MAN WAS SAYING AND PASSED AT THE HEAD OF THE CROWD
YOU GO ALONG WITH THE LADIES HARRY ADDED
WHY DID YOU SPEAK SO TO MISS TAYLOR HE ASKED REPROACHFULLY
SHE SHOOK OFF THE PHANTASY,--AND YET HOW WELL THE GIRL STOOD
YOU KNOW TOM WE'RE ALL MORE OR LESS RASCALLY--EXCEPT ONE EXCEPT WHO HE ASKED QUICKLY
THERE'S A WHITE WOMAN AND HE THREW A STARTLED LOOK AT MARY AND HURRIED BY
THEY'LL GET ONE THEY'LL REMEMBER NOW SEE HERE COLTON,--NOTHING RASH THE COLONEL CHARGED HIM WARNINGLY
WAS DEATH THE WAY--THE WIDE DARK WAY
SHE SAW HIM SURVEYING HER AND SHE SMILED AT HIM
DON'T ATTEMPT TO FIGHT WITH HIM
CAN'T WE KEEP WAGES WHERE WE LIKE BY THREATENING TO BRING IN NIGGER LABOR NO YOU CAN'T PERMANENTLY MAXWELL DISPUTED FOR THEY SOMETIME WILL CALL YOUR BLUFF LET EM CALL SAID TAYLOR AND WE'LL PUT NIGGERS IN THE MILLS WHAT EJACULATED THE LANDLORDS IN CHORUS
THEY SEEMED TRANSFORMED REVIVIFIED CHANGED
HE'S BEEN IN TO SEE ME SEVERAL TIMES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW
THAT IS MA'AM,"--WHY WAS HE SAYING MA'AM LIKE A CHILD OR A SERVANT?--"I KNOW HIS SISTER AND HAVE A LETTER FOR HIM DO YOU LIVE IN WASHINGTON SHE INQUIRED
THEY TOUCHED ON THE WEATHER AND SETTLEMENT WORK
WHAT MEANT THIS SUDDEN ASSUMPTION OF WARMTH AND AMIABILITY
AN OLD MAN LED THE BAND--TALL MASSIVE WITH TUFTED GRAY HAIR AND WRINKLED LEATHERY SKIN AND HIS EYES WERE THE EYES OF DEATH
HE SEEMED HANDSOMER THAN EVER
BLES DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO FEEL RELIEVED OR PROVOKED OR DISAPPOINTED AND BY WAY OF COMPROMISE FELT SOMETHING OF ALL THREE
NEVER BEFORE WAS SUCH A MAGNIFICENT BEGINNING A FULL MONTH AHEAD OF OTHER COTTON
AND BESIDES I HAVEN'T ROOM FOR IT IN MY TRUNKS OF A SUDDEN SHE LEANED DOWN AND WHISPERED TO ZORA
HE WAS PLANNING TO MAKE MORE AND HE HAD SOMETHING TO PET WHICH SEEMED TO HIM EXTRAORDINARILY PRECIOUS AND VALUABLE
YES AND ZORA SHE IS NOT THERE MUCH NOW SHE STAYS AWAY BUT IF SHE ESCAPES WHY NOT YOU SHE WANTS TO ESCAPE AND YOU I DON'T WANT TO THIS STUBBORN DEPRAVITY WAS SO DISTRESSING THAT SARAH SMITH WAS AT AN UTTER LOSS WHAT TO SAY OR DO
THE MEETING NEVER GOT BEYOND A CERTAIN CONSTRAINT
YOU TAKE THIS FROM ME
THE SMILE FADED SLOWLY AND THE RED BLOOD MOUNTED TO HIS FOREHEAD
FOR ONE SHE LOVES THERE IS NOTHING SHE WOULD NOT DO
GOOD-MORNING GOOD-MORNING SHE HESITATED
THE SERVANTS WAITED ON MISS ZORA GLADLY
IT WOULD NOT BE UNPLEASANT
WHY NOT
MISS TAYLOR WAS NO ORDINARY PICTURE
WHEN COTTON ROSE THE TENANTS HAD ALREADY SOLD THEIR COTTON
COME HERE SHE SAID WITH A SUDDEN TURN AND THEY JOINED AN ABSORBED GROUP IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION
MEANWHILE THE MEN ABOVE-STAIRS LINGERED IN THE COLONEL'S OFFICE--THE OLDER ONE PERTURBED AND SPUTTERING THE YOUNGER INSISTENT AND IMPERTURBABLE
IT GREW AND SPREAD SLOWLY ON THE HORIZON UNTIL IT BECAME A FAT OLD BLACK WOMAN HOODED AND APRONED WITH GREAT ROUND HIPS AND MASSIVE BOSOM
THROWING UP THE WINDOW HE DRANK IN THE SPRING BREEZE AND STARED AT THE CITY HE ONCE HAD THOUGHT SO ALLURING
TREMBLINGLY SHE SWAYED TO HER FEET A HAGGARD AWFUL SIGHT
I EXPECT HE WAS HUNGRY AND THEY WHEELED OUT OF THE SQUARE
BUT THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION UNTIL MONEY WAS EARNED
THIS IS POSITIVELY UNCANNY
ZORA WALKED ALONE TO THE VAULTED STATION
SHE'S A WELLESLEY GRADUATE SAID TAYLOR FINALLY
WELL NOW THAT'S JUST MY IDEA SAID MRS GREY THAT THESE SCHOOLS SHOULD FURNISH TRAINED SERVANTS AND LABORERS FOR THE SOUTH
THIS WAS CALDWELL'S EMPORIUM
GOD OWNS IT AND I'M GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO HIM WITH A SWIFT MOTION SHE WHIPPED THE PIN FROM HER POCKET AND RAISED HER ARM TO HURL IT INTO THE SWAMP
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE STOOD THERE--STRANGELY ALMOST UNCANNILY BUT STARTLINGLY BEAUTIFUL WITH HER RICH DARK SKIN SOFTLY MOULDED FEATURES AND WONDERFUL EYES
AND YET HE DARED NOT QUESTION THE AWFUL SHAPE THAT SAT SOMEWHERE COLD AND STILL BEHIND HIS SOUL
THE CHRISTMAS WAS COMING AND ALL THE SOUTHERN WORLD WAS BUSY
MARY TAYLOR WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH IMPATIENT ANGER--AND ANGER INTENSIFIED BY A CONVICTION OF UTTER HELPLESSNESS TO COPE WITH ANY STRAINED OR UNUSUAL SITUATIONS BETWEEN HERSELF AND THESE TWO
THE VERY NEXT DAY TAYLOR SENT OUT A SECOND CASE A CHILD WHO HAD BEEN HURT SOME TIME BEFORE AND WAS NOT RECOVERING AS SHE SHOULD
OF COURSE SENATOR BLES READ WE EXPECT MR ALWYN TO BE THE NEXT REGISTER OF THE TREASURY BLES LOOKED UP IN AMAZEMENT BUT THE SENATOR REACHED FOR A THIRD LETTER
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO LEAD YOUR PEOPLE AND HERE YOU STAND BLINKING AND HESITATING
IT WAS NOT THE FESTIVAL OF THE CHRIST CHILD BUT A TIME OF NOISE AND FROLIC AND LICENSE THE GREAT PAY-DAY OF THE YEAR WHEN BLACK MEN LIFTED THEIR HEADS FROM A YEAR'S TOILING IN THE EARTH AND HAT IN HAND ASKED ANXIOUSLY
NO--EXCEPT THAT HE WAS APPOINTED AND CONFIRMED AT LAST WELL THEY HAD ONLY ARRIVED IN FRANCE WHEN HE DIED OF APOPLEXY
DOWN DOWN SHE SLIPPED TOWARD THE BLACK SLIME OF THE SWAMP AND THE AIR ABOUT WAS HORROR--DOWN DOWN TILL THE CHILLY WATERS STUNG HER KNEES
PERHAPS SAID MRS STILLINGS AS SHE BROUGHT OUT SOME SPECIMENS OF HER WORK
CAN YOU BE READY BY ELEVEN SHE CONSIDERED
ALWYN LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND AT ZORA BUT SHE GAVE NO SIGN UNTIL THEY HEARD A ROLLICKING SONG OUTSIDE AND TYLOR BURST INTO THE ROOM
THE HAT FELL OFF BUT SHE LET IT GO
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND HE SUGGESTED I COULD INTRODUCE MY SISTER TO YOU I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED ANSWERED MISS TAYLOR READILY
YOU REALLY MUST BE CAREFUL ABOUT TRUSTING YOURSELF WITH THESE HALF DRUNKEN NEGROES WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER NOT TO GIVE THEM DRINK MR CRESSWELL AND LET YOUR NEIGHBOR SELL THEM POISON AT ALL HOURS
NOW I WANT TO MORTGAGE IT FOR"--SHE HESITATED--"FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS SILENT BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID
I WANT TO DESPISE YOU DID HE UNDERSTAND
BUT JOHN TAYLOR WAS NOT TO BE DIVERTED
FOR A WEEK OR MORE ZORA SLIPPED IN EVERY DAY AND PERFORMED THE LITTLE TASKS THAT MISS SMITH LAID OUT
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING BUT I KNOW HOW AND WHY AND FROM WHAT AND TO WHAT
DO YOU S'POSE MAMMY'S THE WITCH SHE ASKED DUBIOUSLY
IT'S ZORA--THE GIRL WHO WENT NORTH WITH MRS VANDERPOOL TAYLOR ENLIGHTENED HIM
I'VE COME TO SCHOOL ANSWERED A TALL BLACK BOY WITH A BUNDLE
MRS GREY WOULD GET SUSPICIOUS AND THE DEVIL BE TO PAY
SO STILLINGS ASSURES CRESSWELL AND HIS FRIENDS I SEE MISS WYNN SLOWLY ACKNOWLEDGED
HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BLES NO MA'AM HE SAID EAGERLY
AND I KNOWS JUST THE PLACE SHE CRIED EAGERLY LOOKING AT HIM WITH A FLASH OF THE OLD TEASING MISCHIEF--"DOWN IN THE HEART OF THE SWAMP--WHERE DREAMS AND DEVILS LIVES UP AT THE SCHOOL-HOUSE MISS TAYLOR WAS MUSING
AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO HUMAN SOUL
I'LL ADMIT IT'S OUR GAME TO DELAY THIS AS LONG POSSIBLE IT MUST BE DELAYED FOREVER SIR CAN'T BE WAS THE TERSE RESPONSE
GLAD TO SEE YOU
SHE'S GIVEN TO WANDERING BUT USUALLY SHE IS HERE BEFORE THIS TIME I SAW HER IN TOWN THIS AFTERNOON SAID MRS VANDERPOOL
MONEY IS RATHER SCARCE JUST NOW MISS SMITH
IT EVIDENTLY DIDN'T MRS VANDERPOOL INTERJECTED
ESPECIALLY WAS THIS TRUE OF A CIRCUMSCRIBED RATHER EXCLUSIVE SET WHICH CENTRED AROUND THE VANDERPOOLS OF NEW YORK AND BOSTON
THEN HE SAID
MISS MARY TAYLOR 16 FOUR
A LITTLE SHARP--BUT TRACTABLE
YET SHE DID NOT HESITATE BUT FROM THAT MOMENT SET HERSELF TO HER NEW LIFE TASK
THE CAUSE WAS OBVIOUSLY THE UNEXPECTED SUCCESS OF THE NEW FARMERS LEAGUE AMONG THE COTTON-GROWERS
IT WAS TO HER A STRANGE NEW THING TO SEE A FELLOW OF LIKE YEARS WITH HERSELF AND SHE GRIPPED HIM TO HER SOUL IN WILD INTEREST AND NEW CURIOSITY
HE WAS PROFOUNDLY INTERESTED IN THE COTTON-BELT AND THERE SHE MIGHT BE OF SERVICE TO HIM
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE VANDERPOOLS SHE ASKED
NO INDEED SHE ANSWERED
IT WOULD OFFEND THEIR BACKERS OR SHALL I SAY THEIR TOOLS THE SOUTHERNERS
HE WAS FOLLOWING CRESSWELL AT THE SIDE BUT JUST A LITTLE BEHIND HAT IN HAND HEAD ASLANT AND TALKING DEFERENTIALLY
IT'S GOING TO RUIN THE WHOLE LABOR SYSTEM
HE WAS SPENDING SUNDAY WITH HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND BOTH OVER THEIR AFTER-DINNER CIGARS WERE GAZING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE SWAMP
YET SHE THOUGHT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THAT WAS PAIN
THE BELL RANG AND SHE WAS A LITTLE STARTLED AT THE FRIGHT THAT STRUCK HER HEART
BUT SHE WAS SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT HER WORK AND SHE HAD NOT AS YET PERFECTED IN HER OWN MIND ANY THEORY OF THE WORLD INTO WHICH BLACK FOLK FITTED
I'M A PLAIN MAN
GOD WILLED IT
SHE WALKS WELL SHE OBSERVED
HE PUT IT ASIDE ANGRILY AND GLANCED UP
THAT WOULD BE ONE THOUSAND DOWN AND NINE THOUSAND TO PAY WITH INTEREST SAID CRESSWELL
THE HEAVENS FLAMED SCARLET IN HIS EYES AND HE SCREAMED
BERTIE SHE BEGAN BROKENLY
WHILE ALL ABOUT THE MAD WILD SINGING ROSE AND FELL AND TREMBLED TILL HIS HEAD WHIRLED
I'D LIKE THAT IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF AFFECTION SAID MISS TAYLOR FIRMLY
GOOD-DAY GENTLEMEN BUT THE CHAIRMAN WAS STILL PUZZLED
OF COURSE THERE WAS THE OLDER SET OF OFFICE-HOLDERS AND ROUNDERS
HE WAS ASKED TO HELP
HE KNOWS AND WON'T TELL
AND RIGHT AMONGST THEM THE SUN WHEN HE'S TIRED O NIGHT WHISPERS AND DROPS RED THINGS CEPT WHEN DEVILS MAKE EM BLACK THE BOY STARED AT HER
THE COLONEL REDDENED
SHE SEEMED BUT HALF-CLOTHED AND HER WARM DARK FLESH PEEPED FURTIVELY THROUGH THE RENT GOWN
HE WAS IN THE BARN AND SHE HURRIED THERE
SILENTLY AND DISMALLY THE HALF-DEAD FOREST WITH ITS GHOSTLY MOSS LOWERED AND DARKENED AND THE BLACK WATERS SPREAD INTO A GREAT SILENT LAKE OF SLIMY OOZE
ALREADY IT'S HALF GONE AND WHEN THE REST GOES THEN WILL COME THE END WITHOUT THE GREAT RED SUN PAUSED A MOMENT OVER THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP AND THE LONG LOW CRY OF NIGHT BIRDS BROKE SADLY ON THE TWILIGHT SILENCE
IT WAS ODD TO BEHOLD HARRY CRESSWELL SO DISTURBED
HER QUIETNESS HER QUICKNESS HER YOUNG STRENGTH WERE LIKE A SOOTHING BALM TO THE TIRED WOMAN OF FASHION AND WITHIN A WEEK SHE HAD SUNK BACK CONTENTEDLY INTO ZORA'S STRONG ARMS
PREACHER JONES HAS BEEN TALKING EVERYWHERE AGAINST YOU
YES WE ARE SHE INSISTED
BUT EVEN BEYOND THIS SHE STOOPED TO NO INTRIGUE BECAUSE NONE INTERESTED HER
THE WORLD WAS AGAINST HER AND AGAIN SHE SAW THE FINGERS OF ELSPETH--THE LONG BLACK CLAW-LIKE TALONS THAT CLUTCHED AND DRAGGED HER DOWN--DOWN
WHERE'S YOUR LAWYER HE ASKED SHARPLY OF ZORA
SHE DID NOT TRY TO BUY A PULLMAN TICKET ALTHOUGH THE JOURNEY WAS THIRTY-SIX HOURS
PERHAPS TOO HE MIGHT BE MADE TO SHOW SOME INTEREST
BEHIND IT THE NIGHT SKY WAS TINGED WITH BLOOD
ROUND ABOUT TIED TO THE WELL-GNAWED HITCHING RAILS WERE ROWS OF MULES--MULES WITH BACK CLOTHS
ISN'T IT MR CRESSWELL ASKED MRS GREY
I'LL THINK IT OVER AND SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT
THOUGHT I'D BETTER DROP OVER AT HARRY'S SUGGESTION THEY MOVED TO THE VERANDAH AND SAT DOWN OVER WHISKEY AND SODA WHICH TAYLOR REFUSED AND PLUNGED INTO THE SUBJECT WITHOUT PRELIMINARIES
SHE HEARD ITS HUMAN VOICE AND SOUGHT TO CRY ALOUD
ITS OOZING MUD AND FETID VAPORS ITS CLINGING SLIMY DRAPERIES,--HOW THEY TWINED ABOUT THE BONES OF ITS VICTIMS AND CHILLED THEIR HEARTS
AND SHE ROSE AND WALKED THE ROOM SLOWLY FAST AND FASTER
IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE HAD HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE--BUT WHERE
YOU'RE GOING ANYHOW
HER FACE WAS DULL AND HEAVY AND HOMELY HER OLD EYES SORROWFUL
ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK A BUGGY DROVE UP AND CARTER AND SIMPSON CAME IN--CARTER A SILENT STRONG-FACED BROWN LABORER WHO LISTENED AND LOOKED AND SIMPSON A WORRIED NERVOUS MAN WHO SAT STILL WITH DIFFICULTY AND COMMENCED MANY SENTENCES BUT DID NOT FINISH THEM
THE TOLLIVER GIRLS HAD SIMPLE DRESSES MADE EMBROIDERY WAS ORDERED FROM TOWN AND SOON THERE WOULD BE THE GARDENS AND COTTON FIELDS
IN OTHER WAYS TOO ZORA WHEN HE MET HER WAS TO HIM A NEW CREATURE
THE UNREGULATED FIRE OF ENERGY AND DELICACY OF NERVOUS POISE WITHIN HIM CONTINUALLY HOUNDED HIM TO THE VERGE OF EXCESS AND SOMETIMES BEYOND
NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE END OF THE SUMMER CAME AND THE ONLY OPENING FACING HER WAS THE TEACHING OF CHILDREN AT MISS SMITH'S EXPERIMENT IN THE ALABAMA SWAMPS IT MUST BE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MISS TAYLOR WAS DISAPPOINTED
THE PRESIDENT WAS THERE AND COLONEL CRESSWELL AND ONE OTHER LOCAL DIRECTOR
SHE THOUGHT OF ELSPETH'S CABIN
IT BELONGED--SHE ROSE HASTILY
I THINK HE IS
AND HANGING FROM SHOULDER TO ANKLE IN FORMLESS CLINGING FOLDS BLAZED THE SCARLET GOWN
NO IT HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
SHE KNEW LITTLE OF CLOTHES AND CARED LESS
THE GIRL WAS EMMA AND BESIDE HER SMILING STOOD A HALF-GROWN WHITE MAN
WITH TWINED HANDS AND ARMS AND LIPS EVER AND AGAIN SEEKING THEIR MATES THEY WALKED THE LEAFY WAY
THE BOY WEARILY DROPPED HIS HEAVY BUNDLE AND STOOD STILL LISTENING AS THE VOICE OF CRICKETS SPLIT THE SHADOWS AND MADE THE SILENCE AUDIBLE
MARY TAYLOR YOU ARE A FOOL
IT IS NOT FOR US TO QUESTION THE WISDOM OF THE ALMIGHTY BUT TO BOW HUMBLY TO HIS WILL
YES HER FINGERS WORKED NERVOUSLY
SEPARATE THE LEADERS THE TALENTED THE PUSHERS OF BOTH RACES FROM THEIR MASSES AND THROUGH THEM RULE THE REST BY MONEY BUT COLONEL CRESSWELL SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE FACT IS FATHER HE WAS SAYING AS YOU YOURSELF HAVE SAID ONE BAD CROP OF COTTON WOULD ALMOST RUIN US BUT THE PROSPECTS ARE GOOD WHAT ARE PROSPECTS IN MARCH
AND AFTER LISTENING TO HER HALTING UNCERTAIN REMARKS HE SUGGESTED TO HER CERTAIN MATTERS WHICH IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO BELIEVE WHEN MRS GREY TALKED TO HER
HIS FACE BROUGHT BACK UNUTTERED THINGS THAT MADE HIS HEART BEAT FASTER AND A YEARNING SURGE WITHIN HIM
NOW IF ALWYN FAILS TO LAND I'VE GOT NO CHANCE FOR THE BIGGER PLACE BUT I'VE GOT A GOOD CHANCE TO BE REGISTER ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PLAN
AS A MATTER OF FACT COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS AN HONEST MAN
DU BOIS
ZORA WATCHED IT WEIGHED RECEIVED THE COTTON CHECKS AND ENTERED THE STORE
WHY HAD HE NOT KNOWN
WE GOT OVER HALF THE CROP AND WE CAN SEND PRICES TO THE NORTH STAR--YOU--WHY I FIGURE IT YOU CRESSWELLS ARE WORTH AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ABOVE LIABILITIES THIS MINUTE AND JOHN TAYLOR LEANED BACK AND LIGHTED A BIG BLACK CIGAR
WOULD ZORA MAKE ONE OR WOULD THIS BLOW SEND HER TO PERDITION
MISS TAYLOR HE SAID I WANT TO TALK TO YOU--I HAVE WANTED TO FOR--A YEAR HE GLANCED AT HER
WE'RE DEPENDING ON YOU TO PULL THE PARTY OUT OF AN AWKWARD HOLE AND HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIS CALLER
AND NOW FOR THE SEED HE INTERRUPTED JOYOUSLY
ONE MAY BE CHINESE SPANIARD EVEN INDIAN--ANYTHING WHITE OR DIRTY WHITE IN THIS LAND AND DEMAND DECENT TREATMENT
SHE SAW THE LOVE IN HIS EYES AND HE SAW RISING IN HERS SOMETHING THAT MADE HIS HEART BOUND
SHE SAID AGAIN AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF A HUNDRED TIMES THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND JUST WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED
BUT NOW SINCE THE FLASH OF THE IMMINENT TRAGEDY AT CRESSWELL OAKS HAD CLEARED THE AIR WITH ALL ITS HURT A FRANK UNDERSTANDING HAD BEEN MADE POSSIBLE
IT WAS SIMPLY AN EXTRA DIMENSION IN THEIR WORLD WHEREBY TO CLASSIFY MEN
YOU MUST REST QUIETLY NOW AND WITH A NOD HE PASSED INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO TALK WITH HER HUSBAND
THE FARMERS LEAGUE LEASED THREE WAREHOUSES AT SAVANNAH MONTGOMERY AND NEW ORLEANS
SHE TASTED THE MUD AND COMFORT OF THICK OLD LONDON AND THE WHILE WEPT WITH JEREMIAH AND SANG WITH DEBORAH SEMIRAMIS AND ATALA
BEYOND THESE KNOWN AND DEFINITE DISCRIMINATIONS LAY THE UNKNOWN AND HOVERING
YOU'D LET A NIGGER VOTE WHY YES IF HE HAD SENSE ENOUGH THERE AIN'T NO NIGGER GOT SENSE OH PSHAW TAYLOR EJACULATED WALKING AWAY
SLOWER AND SLOWER HE RAN MORE AND MORE THE THOUGHTS CROWDED HIS HEAD
EASTERLY HAD LONG AND SATISFACTORY INTERVIEWS WITH SEVERAL SENATORS WHILE THE TODD INSURGENTS WERE LOSING HEART AT THE PROSPECT OF CHOOSING BETWEEN VANDERPOOL AND CRESSWELL
IF HE WISHED IT HE MUST DECIDE IMMEDIATELY
THAT'S THE DEVIL WITH WOMEN
MARY CRESSWELL LEANED FORWARD
SHE TURNED DESPERATELY TO THE GRUFF CONDUCTOR
THE PLACE WAS HERS
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH TWINKLING EYES
IS SHE VERY SICK YES--SHE HAS BEEN CALLED SOLEMNLY RETURNED THE DARK YOUNG WOMAN
LOOK HERE HE ANGRILY OPENED UPON THEM IF YOU NIGGERS WANT TO MEET AROUND KEEP OUT OF THIS HOUSE
AND WHAT I DON'T KNOW YOU AND YOUR FATHER DO
THE OUTS THE REFORMERS THE WHOLE TENDENCY TO CONCENTRATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SO ON
HE LOOKED INCREDULOUS
SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU MEET AND TALK WITH MY SISTER MRS GREY
WE LEAVE THAT TO OUR WHITE FRIENDS
WHERE WHO IS IT AND PALE CROWDING FACES BLURRED THE LIGHT
PROBABLY SHE WAS FOR THE NAME ON THE DOOR WAS STILLINGS
I ASKED YOU WHAT IT MEANT TO BE PURE BLES AND--AND YOU TOLD--AND I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH WHAT IT MEANT!--WHAT IT MEANT HE REPEATED IN THE LOW TENSE ANGUISH
GROUPS OF DARK LITTLE CHILDREN PASSED THEM AS THEY NEARED THE SCHOOL STARING WITH WIDE EYES AND GREETING TIMIDLY
ALWYN OF ALABAMA WHY IT'S BLES SHE SAID HER FACE LIGHTING AS HIS DARKENED
HAVE I SHOCKED YOU SHE SAID AS THEY WENT TOWARD THE DOOR
HE SAID I'LL COME WHEN YOU DIE--I'LL COME WHEN YOU DIE AND TAKE THE CONJURE OFF YOU AND THEN HE WENT AWAY ON A BIG FIRE SHUCKS THE BOY WOULD SAY TRYING TO EXPRESS SCORNFUL DISBELIEF WHEN IN TRUTH HE WAS AWED AND DOUBTFUL
ONE MAN ABOVE MEN WHOM SHE COULD RESPECT BUT WOULD NOT MARRY AND ONE MAN LIKE ALL MEN WHOM SHE WOULD MARRY BUT COULD NOT RESPECT
EMMA'S COURSE IN NURSE-TRAINING HAD BEEN SIMPLE AND SHORT AND THERE WAS NO RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
I'M OFFERING TO LET YOU IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR--_NOW_--NOT NEXT YEAR OR YEAR AFTER MR TAYLOR HAVE YOU ANY MONEY IN THIS EVERYTHING I'VE GOT WELL THE THING IS THIS WAY
THERE SWELLED A RHYTHMICAL CHANTING WILDER AND MORE PRIMITIVE THAN SONG
HE BENT OVER HER NERVOUSLY EAGERLY AND SHE LAID DOWN HER SEWING AND SAT SILENT AND PASSIVE WITH DARK BURNING EYES
ALL THIS CONFIRMED SO MANY CONVICTIONS OF HERS
BUT THE OLD WOMAN BROKE DOWN AND SOBBED
I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WERE USING OUR LANGUAGE OR OTHERS SHE'S REALLY UNUSUAL AND SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND THINGS
ALL THE WEEK ITS DOORS WERE FILLED WITH THE COMING AND GOING OF MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN
HE OBEYED LIKE ONE IN A TRANCE
THERE LAY THE DEAD UPON THE HEARTH WITH THE FIRELIGHT FLASHING OVER HER A BLOATED HIDEOUS TWISTED THING DISTORTED IN THE RIGOR OF DEATH
EASTERLY WAS DUE IN A HALF-HOUR
THIS WAS THE SHRINE OF THE BAPTISTS--SHRINE AND ORACLE CENTRE AND SOURCE OF INSPIRATION--AND HITHER ZORA HURRIED
BUT THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WHITE PEOPLE STUFF
HE CONTINUED TO HOLD HER HAND TIGHTLY AND HIS OWN PACE NEVER SLACKENED
GOOD GRACIOUS SHE THOUGHT
OF BITS OF EMPTY EARTH THAT SHOOK THEMSELVES HERE AND THERE LOOSE FROM THEIR BURDEN OF MEN AND LAY NAKED IN THE COLD SHINING SUNLIGHT
GET ME THE TREASURY ON THE TELEPHONE IN A MOMENT THE BELL RANG
PLAIN-SPEAKING WAS THE ONLY COURSE AND MARY IF A LITTLE COMPLACENT PERHAPS IN HER FRANKNESS WAS SINCERE IN HER PURPOSE
I KNOW MISS TAYLOR DON'T THINK MUCH OF US
YES HARRY CALMLY REPLIED
DAMN IT--I WISH WE'D GOT ANOTHER MILLION BALES
THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE FRONT PAGE BUT A DIVORCE A REVOLUTION AND A NEW TRUST
NOT ONE OF THESE LITTLE THINGS ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH MORE THAN A GLANCE BUT TOGETHER THEY BECAME MIGHTY PORTENTOUS
DO YOU KNOW THE MAN THAT STANDS READY TO GOBBLE UP EVERY INCH OF COTTON LAND IN THIS COUNTRY AT A PRICE WHICH NO TRUST CAN HOPE TO RIVAL JOHN TAYLOR'S INTEREST QUICKENED
IT'S PROBABLY WHISKEY HE ASSURED HIS COMPANION IN AN UNDERTONE
WHY SHOULD HE BE ELBOWED INTO THE ROADSIDE DUST BY AN INSOLENT BULLY
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH MORE ATTENTION
THEY KNEW NOT WHAT OR WHY THEY ANSWERED BUT OBEYED THE IRRESISTIBLE CALL WITH HEARTS LIGHT AND SONG UPON THEIR LIPS--THE SONG OF SERVICE
UP TO THE TIME OF MARY TAYLOR'S ARRIVAL THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE VANDERPOOLS AND MRS GREY HAD BEEN A MATTER CHIEFLY OF SMILING BOWS
ON THE STEPS STOOD JOHN TAYLOR AND HELEN CRESSWELL HAND IN HAND AND THEY ALL SMILED AT EACH OTHER
WE'LL WALK BY IT IF YOU WANT TO AND MARY CRESSWELL WALKED IN ANOTHER WORLD
ALL NIGHT THERE WAS COMING AND GOING IN THE CABIN
WELL THERE ARE OF COURSE VARIOUS PARTIES BACK OF THE CHANGE
MRS CRESSWELL PICKED IT UP CURIOUSLY
THERE CAME GRADUALLY A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE TOWN
SHE HAD OFTEN DREAMED OF HER AND HAD SET A HIGH IDEAL
HE DID NOT WANT THEM LIKE THE WHITES--SO COLD AND FORMAL AND PRECISE WITHOUT HEART OR MARROW
THERE IS A GIRL ZORA WHO HAS JUST ENTERED WHO--I MUST SPEAK CANDIDLY--WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE HERE
HER HEART CRIED UP ON THE WORLD'S FOUR CORNERS OF THE WAY AND TO IT CAME THE VISION SPLENDID
STRAINED WHISPERS AROSE
HE KICKED THE GATE OPEN RATHER VICIOUSLY DID NOT STOP TO CLOSE IT AND RODE STRAIGHT ACROSS THE LAWN
WHEN THEY ROLLED UP TO THE HOMESTEAD UNDER ITS FAMOUS OAKS THE HOUR WAS PAST ONE
ALL THIS CAME MUCH MORE SLOWLY AND SPASMODICALLY THAN ONE TELLS IT
THE COLONEL--ZORA ALREADY FORGOTTEN--RODE UP TO THE CRESSWELL OAKS PONDERING DARKLY
THE SNAKE--WHAT IS HE NEARLY AS BAD AS YOU I'LL ADMIT
A MISERY DARKENED HER FACE AND THE LIGHT DIED FROM HER EYES YET SHE LOOKED AT HIM BRAVELY AND HER VOICE CAME LOW AND FULL AS FROM AFAR
AND WHY DOES SHE HOLD A LILY IT STANDS FOR PURITY--SHE WAS A GOOD WOMAN WITH A BABY ZORA ADDED SLOWLY
NOW THAT THE WEB WAS WEAVING ITS LAST MESH IN EARLY JANUARY HE HAUNTED MONTGOMERY AND ON THIS DAY WHEN IT SEEMED THAT THINGS MUST CULMINATE OR HE WOULD GO MAD HE HASTENED AGAIN DOWN TO THE PLANTERS HOTEL AND WAS QUICKLY USHERED TO JOHN TAYLOR'S ROOM
AND THERE IT WAS WITH A CARTOON
HE VIEWED THE OTHER SIDE
ONCE HOWEVER IT CAME OUT FLATLY
CRUELTY POVERTY AND CRIME SHE HAD LOOKED IN THE FACE THAT MORNING AND THE HURT OF IT HELD HER HEART PINCHED AND QUIVERING
SHE WAS READING WELL AND WRITING SOME
MY PEOPLE?--MY PEOPLE SHE MURMURED HALF TO HERSELF
HE SAYS WE OWES HIM BUT DIDN'T YOU SETTLE AT CHRISTMAS YAS'M
WIRE ME SENATOR SMITH PRESENTED THE MATTER BLUNTLY TO CRESSWELL AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM
IT SEEMED FIT THAT A DEEP GROAN OF PAIN SHOULD GATHER ITSELF FROM THE MYSTERIOUS DEPTHS OF THE SWAMP AND DROP LIKE A PALL ON THE BLACK PORTAL OF THE CABIN
WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO WHAT GOOD
HE CAME OFFERING AN OLIVE BRANCH FROM THE WHITE ARISTOCRACY TO THIS WORK
ZORA LOOKED DISAPPOINTED AND FIGURED OUT THE MATTER SLOWLY
HE PACED THE ROOM FITFULLY
WHAT CAN A HALF-TAUGHT BLACK GIRL DO IN THIS WILDERNESS HER HEART ANSWERED BACK
HOW MUCH OF IT HE ASKED FINALLY
SHE LAY BACK AND CLOSED HER EYES AND FELL LIGHTLY ASLEEP
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE LIKED IT AND PUTTING IT IN HER POCKET WENT OUT TOO
I THINK MISS SMITH YOU ARE MAKING A VERY GRAVE MISTAKE
BUT THE LAST PLANTATION WAS YET TO BE PASSED
IT MUST BE STOPPED AT ALL HAZARDS
SHE REMEMBERED WITH WHAT INTEREST SHE HAD ALWAYS READ OF THIS LITTLE THREAD OF THE WORLD
REMEMBER THAT GOD DID NOT CREATE MEN EQUAL BUT UNEQUAL AND SET METES AND BOUNDS
MISS SMITH WAS LOOKING AT HER OWN SKIES AND DESPITE THE PROMISED SUNRISE THEY LOOMED DARKLY
ADDING AS SHE ROSE BUT THEY OWN US BODY AND SOUL SHE HURRIED OUT OF THE DINING-ROOM WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK
THEY GLANCED QUICKLY AT EACH OTHER AND EACH WONDERED IF THE OTHER HAD SHARED HIS THOUGHT
NO MORE CONSIDERATION--KILL IT AND KILL IT NOW
HE MUST AGAIN LOOK INTO THE MYSTERY OF HER GREAT EYES
BUT ZORA'S HAND WAS ON HIS SHOULDER
THERE CAME NO WORD AS THE MAN MOVED SLOWLY AWAY
IN NO FACT OR PICTURE HAVE I CONSCIOUSLY SET DOWN AUGHT THE COUNTERPART OF WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN OR KNOWN
DIVIDE AND CONQUER NONSENSE
BUT ALREADY THE PEOPLE WERE GATHERING WITH FRIGHTENED ANXIOUS DESPERATE FACES
TRY HIM AT TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS A SPEECH
SO AT LAST IT CAME TO EASTER MORNING
A VAGUE RESENTMENT ROSE IN HIM
ALL THE WHILE THE WALLS ROSE STRAIGHT ABOUT HER AND NARROW
I'LL--LOOK THIS UP
MRS VANDERPOOL TO WHOM IT SEEMED TOO FAMILIAR FOR COMMENT HAD SAID NO WORD
SUDDENLY SHE LEANED OVER
SHE HAD HIS FAVORITE DISHES
THEY WERE TRYING TO TEMPT HER
SHE DID NOT SEEM TO SEE HER MAID NOR THE WHITE AND SATIN MORNING-ROOM
HER HUMILIATION AFTER THE EPISODE AT CRESSWELL OAKS HAD BEEN COMPLETE
HER HAND GROPED TOWARD HIM
ALL THE LATENT MOTHER IN HER BROODED OVER THEM
IT WAS THE SAME OLD TALE OF BLIND RECEIPTS FOR MONEY ON ACCOUNT"--NO ITEMS NO BALANCING
AS SHE GAZED THAT ODD MIRAGE OF OTHER DAYS HAUNTED HER AGAIN
SEVERAL TIMES HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH AND FROWNED
IT'S BOUND TO PASS
COLONEL CRESSWELL I'M THINKING OF RAISING SOME MONEY FROM A MORTGAGE ON OUR SCHOOL PROPERTY THE COLONEL'S FACE INVOLUNTARILY LIGHTED UP
HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN IT IN THE WILD EXCITEMENT OF THE COTTON CORNER
THEY'LL STAMPEDE SOON
SAME THING APPLIES TO THE TARIFF
POOH
THE RAGING OF COLONEL CRESSWELL'S ANGER NOW TURNED AGAINST JOHN TAYLOR AS WELL AS THE NEGROES
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE IS TO BE INVITED TO MAKE THE PRINCIPAL ADDRESS TO THE GRADUATES OF THE COLORED HIGH-SCHOOL BUT SHE OBJECTED
THEN YOU CAN LEAVE THE PLACE ZORA SHE EXCLAIMED GLADLY
DELICATELY TOO BUT GRADUALLY THE COMPANIONSHIP OF BLES AND ZORA WAS GUIDED AND REGULATED
PRECISELY AND THUS POSTPONE THE DECISION NO MR CRESSWELL
THERE SHE LAY--WET BEDRAGGLED MOTIONLESS GRAY-PALLID BENEATH HER DARK-DRAWN SKIN HER BURNING EYES SEARCHING RESTLESSLY FOR SOME LOST THING HER LIPS A-MOANING
BLES--HITCH UP HE WAS VEXED
ALWYN WENT STRAIGHT TOWARD THE HOUSE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE OAK AVENUE
IT WAS A PLAN CAREFULLY STUDIED OUT LONG THOUGHT OF AND READ ABOUT
WE TRIED TO COMBINE AGAINST MANUFACTURERS IN THE FARMERS LEAGUE OF LAST WINTER
COLONEL CRESSWELL WHO DREW THIS CONTRACT OF SALE THE BLACK GIRL DID IMPOSSIBLE SHE CERTAINLY DID--WROTE IT IN MY PRESENCE WELL IT'S MIGHTY WELL DONE YOU MEAN IT WILL STAND IN LAW IT CERTAINLY WILL
YOU WOULD HAVE TRIED TO SHOW HER AND WOULD HAVE FAILED MISERABLY
ON SATURDAY SATURDAY IS MY REALLY BUSY DAY DON'T YOU KNOW
I'M GOING TO WASHINGTON THIS WINTER
SORROW IS BORN OF SELFISHNESS AND SELF-SEEKING--OUR OWN GOOD OUR OWN HAPPINESS OUR OWN GLORY
HE WAS SOON TIRED OF THE STRANGE COMPANY AND HAD TURNED TO GO HOME WHEN HE MET A NEWCOMER IN THE DOORWAY
SHE LAY PANTING AND SWEATING ACROSS THE BENT AND BROKEN ROOTS OF THE OAK
MOAN SISTER MAXWELL FOR THE BACKBITING YOU DID TODAY
WHERE DO YOU TEACH ASKED MR CALDWELL
THERE WAS A CERTAIN GRIM POWER BENEATH THE GREYS MAHOGANY AND VELVETS THAT THRILLED WHILE IT APPALLED
WHILE JOHNSON MOVED TOO OBJECTING AND HINTING
IT IS PARTIALLY CLEARED CONTINUED ALWYN AND OUR PLAN IS TO SELL OFF SMALL TWENTY-ACRE FARMS YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING ON TWENTY ACRES BEGAN JOHNSON BUT TYLOR LAID HIS HUGE HAND RIGHT OVER HIS MOUTH AND SAID BRIEFLY
WE'LL SCARE THEM WITH A VISION OF NIGGERS IN THE MILLS COLONEL CRESSWELL WAS NOT SO EASILY WON OVER TO THE NEW SCHEME
I FIND OUT ABOUT YOU AND MY SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE ARE WIDE AND UNERRING
NELL--NELL
ACCORDINGLY THE TAYLORS ARRIVED A WEEK BEFORE THE WEDDING AND THE HOME TOOK ON A FESTIVE AIR
AND CARRIE WYNN--POOR CARRIE WITH HER PRIDE AND POSITION DRAGGED DOWN IN HIS RUIN
BOTH PARTIES ARE BACK OF IT AND PUBLIC OPINION IS AROUSED
ZORA YES BLES YOU--YOU TOLD ME--YOU WERE--PURE SHE WAS SILENT BUT HER BODY WENT ALL A-TREMBLE
HERE YOU JIM TAKE THE BIG MULES AND DRIVE LIKE--WHERE'S THAT WENCH BUT ZORA WAS ALREADY STRIDING ON AHEAD AND WAS FAR UP THE RED ROAD WHEN THE GREAT MULES GALLOPED INTO SIGHT AND THE LONG WHIP SNAPPED ABOVE THEIR BACKS
ZORA WAS NOT MEANT FOR MARRYING
WHO IS IT AND WHAT DO YOU WANT PLEASE MA'AM
THE GIRL WAS STILL SILENT AND THE HORSE STOPPED
FEW PEOPLE WERE BUSIER THAN BLES AND ZORA
TO MARRY HIM OH NO
PRODUCED BY SUZANNE SHELL MARTIN PETTIT AND THE PG ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET
I TOLD YOU THAT HE SHOULD BE APPOINTED AND REMAIN A MAN
THIRTY-ONE A PARTING OF WAYS WAS THE CHILD BORN DEAD WORSE THAN DEAD SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE MARY CRESSWELL HAD HEARD THESE WORDS
I DO HOPE THE THING CAN BE MANAGED BUT WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULTIES MRS VANDERPOOL INTERRUPTED
SHE HAD TO LIVE AND DANCE AND SING
HE KNEW NO PRETTY SPEECHES HE CERTAINLY DID NOT MEASURE UP TO HER STANDARD OF BREEDING AND YET SOMEHOW HE WAS A GENTLEMAN
HE WAS TOO YOUNG AND HEADY
BRER RABBIT--POOR LITTLE BRER RABBIT DON'T YOU KNOW YOU MUSTN'T EAT ZORA'S COTTON
ALWAYS HE WOULD GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY BACK ALONG THE PATH BEHIND HIM
THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT THE BRAINS OF THE NATION WHY NOT MAKE A SPEECH ON THE SUBJECT SHE SUGGESTED
I'LL--I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO AUNT RACHEL--I MUST DO SOMETHING MURMURED MISS SMITH HASTILY AS THE WOMAN DEPARTED AND AN OLD BLACK MAN CAME LIMPING IN
AND SO THESE TWO CHILDREN GREW WITH IT INTO THEIRS
AT FIRST WITH SUSPICIOUS ALOOFNESS BUT GRADUALLY MELTING UNDER ZORA'S TACT UNTIL THEY SAT AND TALKED WITH HER AND TOLD THEIR TROUBLES AND STRUGGLES
AND SO AGAIN THEY SAT AND WAITED AND WAITED SAYING NO WORD
THE SUDDEN REACTION THE REVULSION OF HER AGITATED FEELINGS LEFT HER BREATHLESS
HE STEPPED FORWARD UNTIL SHE COULD ALMOST TOUCH HIM
HE HAD LEFT HER TO GO TO DESTRUCTION AND EXPECTED THAT SHE WOULD
SHE RUSHED IN TO MISS SMITH AND FOUND HER SITTING THERE--STRAIGHT UPRIGHT COMPOSED IN ALL SAVE THAT THE TEARS WERE STREAMING DOWN HER FACE AND SHE WAS MAKING NO EFFORT TO STOP THEM
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE FIRST TIME PERHAPS ZORA GAVE HER LIFE A PECULIAR HUMAN INTEREST
IT WAS NOT A SONG OF SORROW
SHE WOULD POINT OUT THE GREATER CAREER BEFORE HIM IF ONLY HE WOULD BE A MAN
LIKE A BROODING MOTHER ZORA HAD WATCHED IT
I'LL SEND HER TO YOU TOMORROW SHE SAID QUIETLY
A LIGHT SHOWER FLEW UP FROM THE SOUTH LINGERED A WHILE AND FLED LEAVING A FRAGRANCE IN THE AIR
BLES FOLLOWED DEBATING JUST WHAT HE OUGHT TO SAY HOW FAR HE MIGHT VENTURE TO ACCOMPANY HER WHAT--BUT SHE EASILY SETTLED IT ALL
THEN THE MISCHIEF DANCED IN HER EYES AND A SONG BUBBLED ON HER LIPS
HE CAUGHT AN UNFAMILIAR NOTE IN HIS VOICE AND A WILD DESIRE TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF BEFORE THIS WOMAN CLAMORED IN HIS HEART
SEE WHAT I'VE BOUGHT
HE CLENCHED HIS HANDS MURDER IN HIS HEART
I KNOW ONE THING LIKE THE MAN IN THE BIBLE
SHE HAD PROMISED ZORA THAT BLES SHOULD RECEIVE HIS REWARD ON TERMS WHICH WOULD NOT WOUND HIS MANHOOD
AND MY BROTHERS THEY ARE NOT ALL DEAD YET
BUT ONE SHE HAD KNOWN LONG ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD
YOU SEE I MIGHT GIVE IT TO THE SCHOOL BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT I'D LIKE TO BUY SOME LAND FOR SOME OF THE TENANTS I'VE GOT NO LAND TO SELL SAID THE COLONEL
YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE PRETTY WELL THEN I KNOWS DEM ALL
BUT WHAT HE DON'T KNOW OF THIS CASE I THINK I DO
YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY WHEN MR EASTERLY CALLED YES REPLIED MRS VANDERPOOL FAINTLY
TEN PER CENT SHE STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND COLONEL CRESSWELL SPOKE UP
HE LET IN SOME EAGER OUTSIDE CAPITAL TO THE SAFER MANUFACTURING SCHEME AND WITHDREW A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF MRS GREY'S MONEY
THEREFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO HESITATE
QUICKLY FINISHING HER TOILET SHE HURRIED DOWN TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS FOR THEY WERE ALONE THAT NIGHT
ZORA WAS SCARCELY SEATED WHEN THAT STRANGE SIXTH SENSE OF HERS TOLD HER THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED AND IT NEEDED BUT A SIDE-GLANCE FROM MRS VANDERPOOL TO INDICATE WHAT IT WAS
YES THERE WERE SIGNS OF TASTE AND WEALTH
USED TO BE ONE OF OUR SERVANTS--YOU REMEMBER
MARY SAID HE TO HIS SISTER AS HE FINALLY ROSE TO GO TELL ME ABOUT THE CRESSWELLS MARY EXPLAINED TO HIM AT LENGTH THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER KNOWING MUCH ABOUT THE LOCAL WHITE ARISTOCRACY OF TOOMS COUNTY AND THEN TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD HEARD
OH NO
OH NO
HUMAN POWER CAN NOT STAY THE DASHING TORRENT OF FEAR-INSPIRED HUMAN PANIC
MR ALWYN I BELIEVE YES SIR AND MY FRIEND MISS WYNN THE SENATOR GLANCED AT MISS WYNN AND SHE BOWED DEMURELY
BUT HIS SON IGNORED THE REMARK AND THE FATHER CONTINUED
TO WHICH MRS VANDERPOOL ADDED
HE TOOK A DEEP DRAUGHT
ZORA TURNED BACK STEADILY TO HER ROOM AND LOCKED HERSELF IN
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR BEING BROUGHT BACK TO THE SCHOOL TO GREET MISS SMITH AND BREAK THE NEWS OF THE COMING OF THE PARTY
SHE HAD DREAMED THAT IT WAS ALL HERS SINCE THAT NIGHT OF DEATH AND CIRCLING FLAME WHEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SOUL TO SOUL
HIS HEART BOUNDED IN SUDDEN FEAR
FOR MARY CRESSWELL WITH THE RESTLESSNESS AND UNHAPPINESS OF AN UNEMPLOYED WOMAN WAS TRYING TO ATONE FOR HER FORMER BLUNDERS
HE STRUGGLED WITH HIS VOICE BUT IT GRATED AND CAME HOARSE AND HARD FROM HIS QUIVERING THROAT
WAIT SHE CRIED SHORTLY AND BEGAN TO DRESS
SHE KNEW
HE WAS VERY OBSERVANT
TO WORK IN THE FIELDS MEANT ENDLESS TOIL AND A VISTA THAT OPENED UPON DEATH
THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE BETRAYED INTO SOME SHOW OF CONSIDERATION FOR A BLACK WOMAN
THEN COME LITTLE FLECKS HERE AND THERE AND THE SEA IS ALL FILLED WITH FLOWERS--FLOWERS LIKE LITTLE BELLS BLUE AND PURPLE AND WHITE AH
HITHERTO TOWN AND COUNTRY HAD BEEN RULED BY A FEW GREAT LANDLORDS BUT AT THE VERY FIRST ELECTION COLTON AN UNKNOWN OUTSIDER HAD BEATEN THE REGULAR CANDIDATE FOR SHERIFF BY SUCH A MAJORITY THAT THE BIG PROPERTY OWNERS DARED NOT COUNT HIM OUT
THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION AND SNICKERING IN THE COURTROOM
AM I
WE CAN
WE CAN
BLES ALWYN AROSE NEXT MORNING AND EXAMINED THE SKY CRITICALLY
FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD
DO YOU KNOW HOW ASKED THE DRESSMAKER
MISS WYNN WAS RIGHT WHY ZORA DID HELENE ATTEND THE BALL FOUR YEARS AGO BUT ZORA MUST YOU FOLK APE OUR NONSENSE AS WELL AS OUR SENSE YOU FORCE US TO SAID ZORA
I SPECK HE NEEDED IT BUT HE'S A GROWN MAN MISS SMITH URGED EARNESTLY
IT'S PRECISELY THESE LEADERS OF THE NEGROES THAT WE MUSH CRUSH HE INSISTED
IT DIED AWAY AND ROSE AGAIN
IT SOUNDED WONDERFUL
PERHAPS--IF THE WATER HAD BUT DRAINED FROM THE COTTON!--IT WAS SO STRONG AND TALL
YOU MUST GET TO THE FIELD TO-MORROW,"--HIS HABITUALLY CALM UNFEELING POSITIVENESS LEFT NO GROUND FOR OBJECTION
SHE KEPT TOYING WITH THE PIN AND ZORA WATCHED HER
AFTER SOME DAYS THEY LET HER SIT BY THE WINDOW AND SHE SAW BLES PASS BUT DREW BACK TIMIDLY WHEN HE LOOKED
HERE BOYS BUT ZORA HAD COME FORWARD INTO THE SPACE WHERE THE SUNLIGHT OF THE WIDE FRONT DOORS POURED IN UPON THE COTTON BALES
BLES ALWYN MET HER AT THE TRAIN
SHE COULD NOT TELL MISS SMITH HER TROUBLES ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW MISS SMITH MUST SUSPECT
SHE HEARD A CALLING IN THE SWAMP AND THE SHADOW OF ELSPETH SEEMED TO HOVER OVER HER CLAIMING HER FOR HER OWN DRAGGING HER DOWN DOWN
HELEN CRESSWELL WAS TWENTY SMALL AND PRETTY WITH A SLIGHTLY LANGUID AIR
MRS GREY LOOKED SURPRISED
AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND SAID THE LEGISLATOR
YOU CAN'T
ELSPETH WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVORITE SERVANT AND MY OWN MAMMY
AND THEN--GREAT GOD IN HEAVEN
BLES STARTS FOR MONTGOMERY ALWYN LOOKED UP
IS IT YOU LITTLE WIFE COME BACK TO ACCUSE ME
SHE HAD BEEN HERE--HERE IN WASHINGTON
SHE STEPPED BACK SCANDALIZED
SHE CAN TALK MUCH BETTER THAN MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND THEN SHE PIQUES MY CURIOSITY
BUT HE GAVE A LOUD PROTESTING SNORT AND BALKED
SHE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE TEMPTATION YET THE LARGER AMOUNT WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS DESIRABLE TO HER AS THE SMALLER AND SHE KNEW THAT THEY KNEW IT
PRETTY SOON THE DARKY WILL BE HOLDING US UP
THEN HE HAD BROUGHT THIS NOVEL AND--WELL SHE HAD BALKED AT THE SECOND CHAPTER AND HE HAD KISSED HER AND CALLED HER HIS LITTLE PRUDE SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE A PRUDE
TODAY THE CRESSWELLS WERE ALMOST MILLIONAIRES
HAVE YOU HIRED A MAID ASKED HELEN
THERE HAD BEEN NO FORMAL DIVORCE AND SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED THERE NEVER WOULD BE
AT LAST OF ONE GRAY MORNING WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILLEST THEY CAME AND TOLD HIM SHE WILL LIVE AND HE WENT OUT UNDER THE STARS LIFTED HIS LONG ARMS AND SOBBED
HE MUST EVICT ZORA'S TENANTS AS SOON AS THE CROPS WERE PLANTED AND HARVESTED
THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED
I--I--DON'T UNDERSTAND HE STAMMERED
I GUESS MY COURAGE WAS GONE
AND THEN THERE'S YOUR SISTER BY JOVE
THE PROMISE 108 THIRTEEN
IT'S QUITE UNNECESSARY
NOT ME WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DON'T KNOW YET I WISH I COULD SEE A NIGGER HARK STEALTHY STEPS WERE APPROACHING A GLINT OF STEEL FLASHED BEHIND THE FIRE LIGHTS
NEITHER DO I SAID HARRY WHO DETECTED YIELDING IN HIS FATHER'S TONE
THEY CAN EASILY HURRY THE THING ALONG HELEN WAS DELIGHTED
IF WE ONLY COULD GROANED THE COLONEL
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HER THE TWO ARE NOT QUITE THE SAME OF COURSE NOT
A FEW MORE DETAILS SETTLED AND SOME MORE WHISKEY CONSUMED AND TEERSWELL WENT HOME AT MIDNIGHT IN HIGH SPIRITS
HE LOOKED AND HARKENED STARTING AT HIS OWN HEARTBEATS AND FEARING MORE AND MORE THE LONG DARK FINGERS OF THE NIGHT
HE WAS BLACK WITH ANGER
MRS VANDERPOOL HAD HARDLY REACHED THE OAKS BEFORE MISS SMITH WAS DRIVING TOWARD TOWN
HAD SHE MET THIS STATELY CEREMONY WITH ENOUGH BREEDING TO SHOW THAT SHE TOO WAS SOMEBODY
YET EVER AND ALWAYS THERE WERE TENSE SILENT WHITE-FACED MEN MOVING IN THAT SWARM WHO FELT NO POETRY AND HEARD NO SONG AND ONE OF THESE WAS JOHN TAYLOR
ALL HIS DARKNESS WAS SUDDEN LIGHT
IT IS THE ONLY WAY WELL PERHAPS FOR US--BUT NOT FOR A BOY LIKE BLES AND A GIRL LIKE ZORA TRUE
THE CRY OF DEATH IS IN THE AIR
SHE PLUNGED IN
IN REALITY--PRIDE FORBADE HER TO ADMIT IT--SHE FEARED IT WAS A CALL OF SOME OF HARRY'S FRIENDS
I THINK IT'S JUST A BLUFF
I'LL MAKE HER WORK
ARE YOU BLIND
HOW LONG BEFORE THE STALKS WILL BE READY TO CUT SHE ASKED CARELESSLY
WITHIN MRS VANDERPOOL WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED AT HERSELF
THEY HANGS THERE LIKE BIG FLOWERS DRIPPING DEW AND SUGAR AND BLOOD--RED RED BLOOD
THE WHISPERING AND FLITTING OF WILD THINGS AND THE WINGING OF FURTIVE BIRDS
BUT NOW IT WAS DIFFERENT
ZO-RA
LIFE RAN VERY SMOOTHLY AND COURTEOUSLY
ON CAME THE GALLOPING HORSES
I WISH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE A SOUTHERNER AND A CHRISTIAN AND AN HONEST MAN TO TREAT NIGGERS AND DAGOES AND WHITE TRASH LIKE MEN AND BE BIG ENOUGH TO SAY TO HELL WITH CONSEQUENCES COLONEL CRESSWELL STARED AT HIS NEIGHBOR SPEECHLESS WITH BEWILDERMENT AND OUTRAGED TRADITIONS
HE BURST INTO HER VIEW WITH THE FURY OF A BEAST RENDING THE WOOD AWAY AND TRAMPLING THE UNDERBRUSH REELING AND MUTTERING UNTIL HE SAW HER
SUPPOSE SUCH A CONJUNCTION SHOULD COME TO PASS
IT DOESN'T COME OUT WHERE DOES IT GO IT GOES TO ELSPETH'S WHY WE MUST TURN BACK IMMEDIATELY
SHE TRIED TO REMEMBER BUT COULD NOT
FULL OF GREAT AND AWFUL VISIONS STEEPED BODY AND SOUL IN WOOD-LORE
THERE WAS BUT ONE RESOURCE--SHE MUST KEEP THE MATTER OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS AND SEE STILLINGS WHOM SHE NOW REMEMBERED WELL
A VEILING OF THE SELF EVEN IN INTIMATE TALK
LITTLE FRIGHTENED ANIMALS FLED FOR SHELTER
AND ZORA FORGOT TIME AND OCCASION
WHAT ON EARTH SHALL I TALK ABOUT THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN SUGGESTED THE LADY
HE RECEIVED HER WITH COURTESY OFFERED A CHAIR LAID ASIDE HIS CIGAR AND ESSAYED SOME GENERAL REMARKS ON COTTON WEATHER
IT REMINDS ME OF THE SWAMP SHE SAID
IF YOU MAKE A GOOD DEPOSIT I'LL THROW OFF TEN PER CENT WHICH IS ALL OF MY PROFIT THANK YOU SAID ALWYN BUT HE LOOKED OVER THE ACCOUNT AND FOUND THE WHOLE BILL AT LEAST TWICE AS LARGE AS HE EXPECTED
BUT FROM THE LOVE SHE KNEW TO BE SO NEAR HER HEART SHE RECOILED IN PERTURBATION
OH I SHA'N'T WORK
COTTON WAS CONVERSATION
I NEED YOU AND I KNOW YOU NEED ME
THE BOY CROUCHED AND SNARLED AND AGAIN THE WHIP HISSED AND CRACKED
IN THE MORNING HE PEERED OUT AS THE CAVALCADE APPROACHED AND NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE RECOGNIZED COLTON THE SHERIFF AND SIGNALLED TO HIM CAUTIOUSLY
IT IS NOTHING
ZORA HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE BUT A WEEK WHEN A LARGE EXPRESS PACKAGE WAS RECEIVED FROM JOHN TAYLOR
THIS COLD CALM THAT HID HELL AND ITS FIRES
HE SHOULD HAVE A GREAT POSITION FOR THIS WHY CERTAINLY MRS VANDERPOOL AGREED AND THEN CURIOUSLY
ONE DAY WHEN ZORA WAS HELPING MISS SMITH IN THE BEDROOM SHE PAUSED WITH HER ARMS FULL OF CLOTHES FRESH FROM THE LAUNDRY
BUT AT LEAST I HAVE BEEN HONEST
HE WAS A MIGHTY MAN BLACK AND WHITE-HAIRED AND HIS EYES WERE THE EYES OF DEATH
THERE WERE MULES AND HORSES AND OXEN WAGONS AND BUGGIES AND CARTS
I--I HOPED HE BEGAN HESITATINGLY THAT PERHAPS I MIGHT GET A PROMOTION BUT I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF A FIRST-CLASS CLERKSHIP H'M SENATOR SMITH LEANED BACK AND TWIDDLED HIS THUMBS STARING AT ALWYN UNTIL THE HOT BLOOD DARKENED HIS CHEEKS
AND AS THEY FLEW TOWARD THE TOWERING RAMPARTS OF NEW YORK SHE SAT UP BIG WITH THE TERROR OF A NEW THOUGHT
NOW HE WAS A POLITICIAN--BUT NOTHING ELSE
AFTER THAT WE DON'T CARE
IT'S EXTRA COTTON--SAY FIFTEEN CENTS A POUND--ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS--SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS TO YOU--H'M HE TOOK A NOTE-BOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET PUSHED HIS HAT BACK ON HIS HEAD AND PAUSED TO RELIGHT HIS CIGARETTE
FROM THE PEASANT TOILING IN RUSSIA THE LADY LOLLING IN LONDON THE CHIEFTAIN BURNING IN AFRICA AND THE ESQUIMAUX FREEZING IN ALASKA
THESE MEN AND WOMEN OF HER CHILDHOOD HAD HITHERTO WALKED BY HER LIKE SHADOWS
SHE LISTENED TO DEMOSTHENES AND WALKED THE APPIAN WAY WITH CORNELIA--WHILE ALL NEW YORK STREAMED BENEATH HER WINDOW
GET TOGETHER WITH THE NIGGERS AND HOLD UP THIS WHOLE CAPITALIST GANG
I UNDERSTAND YOU DO AND THAT YOU MADE AN UNUSUALLY FINE SPEECH ON THE SUBJECT THE OTHER NIGHT THANK YOU SIR THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN BLES HAD EXPECTED AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED
AS JOHN AND MARY TAYLOR HAD NO SUITABLE HOME THEY WERE TO COME DOWN AND THE TWO BRIDES TO GO FORTH FROM THE CRESSWELL MANSION
MRS CRESSWELL EASILY FELL INTO THE HABIT OF WALKING BY HERE EACH DAY COMING DOWN THE AVENUE OF OAKS ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
FIFTEEN REVELATION HARRY CRESSWELL WAS SCOWLING OVER HIS BREAKFAST
I'M ONLY SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO HARRY MADE HASTE TO PLACATE THE RISING TIDE OF WRATH
WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY HE MADE SOME EXCUSE AND STARTED TO TOWN WHILE MR CRESSWELL WENT TO THE TELEPHONE
IT MEANS HE STAMMERED GROPING FOR MEANINGS--"IT MEANS BEING GOOD--JUST AS GOOD AS A WOMAN KNOWS HOW SHE WHEELED QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND ASKED HIM EAGERLY
SHE HAD TRIED TO ASK THE GREY OLD DOCTOR BUT HE SOOTHED HER LIKE A CHILD EACH DAY AND LEFT HER LYING THERE
ALL THE RICH BLACK GROUND WAS SPRINKLED WITH TENDER GREEN
NOT SINCE I KNEW YOU BLES--NEVER NEVER SINCE I SAW YOU SINCE--SINCE HE GROANED--"CHRIST
SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF WILLING TO SACRIFICE ALMOST ANYTHING FOR ZORA
SHE AND THE OTHERS LIKE HER BUT WHERE HAVE YOU SENT THEM TO HELL MARY TAYLOR STARTED UNDER THE SHOCK
TO HIM A WHITE MAN WAS AN ARCHANGEL WHILE THE CRESSWELLS HIS FATHER'S MASTERS STOOD FOR GOD
REVELATION 134 SIXTEEN
THE VERY NEXT DAY ZORA CHOSE TO SHOW BLES OVER HER NEW HOME AND GROUNDS AND TO SPEAK FRANKLY TO HIM
HARRY WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR WHY YES--IF IT IS SOMETHING I WANT VERY VERY MUCH WELL ALL RIGHT IF HARRY I FEEL A LITTLE--HYSTERICAL TONIGHT AND--YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME WILL YOU HARRY STANDING THERE SHE SAW THE TABLEAU IN HER OWN MIND AND IT LOOKED STRANGE
MISS WYNN SAT LOST IN THOUGHT AND TEERSWELL BESIDE HER FUMED
BUT HE'S SUCH AN EXCEPTIONAL RASCAL
IN YOURS SHE IS A PROBLEM TO BE STATED STRAIGHTENED AND SOLVED
WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO YOUTH AND RESOLUTION LET THE SHABBINESS INCREASE
THAT WOULD MEAN FROM TWENTY-FIVE TO FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
IT WAS EIGHTEEN LITTLE MONTHS AGO THAT SHE HAD RIDDEN UP TO THE WORLD WITH WIDENING EYES
DON'T BE FOOLISH HE GROWLED
WAS MISS CRESSWELL AT HOME MARY REDDENED
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU A MOMENT COLONEL SHE ASKED
WHY MISS TAYLOR I WAS ALARMED FOR YOU
SHE OPENED HER EYES
HE'S A MAN AND A HUMAN ONE AND IF YOU KEEP ON MAKING MUCH OVER HIM AND TALKING TO HIM AND PETTING HIM HE'LL HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERPRET YOUR MANNER IN HIS OWN WAY--THE SAME THAT ANY YOUNG MAN WOULD BUT--BUT HE'S A--A A NEGRO
IF HE COULD THUS STIR MEN AND NOT BE HIMSELF SWAYED SHE MUSED HE WOULD BE--INVINCIBLE
DR BOLDISH OF ST FAITH'S RICH PARISH TO BE ONE OF THE PARTY AND AT THE LAST MOMENT TEMPLE BOCOMBE THE SOCIOLOGIST CONSENTED TO JOIN
BUT HE WENT ON TENSELY WITH FLYING WORDS
TWO OR THREE SMALL COTTON CORNERS BROUGHT HIM HIS TENS OF THOUSANDS
DO YOU EVER TELL LIES ZORA YES DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IS A WICKED BAD HABIT WHY BECAUSE GOD HATES THEM HOW DOES YOU KNOW HE DOES ZORA'S TONE WAS STILL IMPERSONAL
COLONEL CRESSWELL HIMSELF CAUGHT THE CONVERSATION AND IT STRUCK HIM WITH A CERTAIN DISMAY
I AM SIMPLY TRYING TO MAKE CLEAR TO YOU WHY YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL
SHORTLY AFTERWARD THEY WERE APPROACHING THE CRESSWELL MANSION WHEN THE YOUNG MAN REINED IN THE HORSE
WHERE YOU GOING SAY HE WHISPERED ANOTHER TIME DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY THESE GOLD SPECTACLES
BUT STILLINGS CONTINUED SMOOTHLY
SOME IS LONG AND SHINY LIKE CREEPY SLIPPERY SNAKES
THE END OF EVERYTHING
I'M SURE I DON'T MEAN TO AND--I HOPE GOD WILL FORGIVE ME ZORA SOFTENED
HE SKIRTED THE ISLAND SLOWLY STOPPING NEAR ZORA'S OAK
IT IS--MY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION ZORA SMILED AND THANKED HER
SLOWLY SHE CAUGHT HER MOTOR AND FELL WEARILY BACK ON ITS CUSHIONS
ZORA HE ANNOUNCED ONE MORNING UNDER THEIR FOREST OAK YOU MUST GO TO SCHOOL SHE EYED HIM SURPRISED
COOL QUIET AND GENTLEMANLY AS HE WAS BY RULE OF HIS CLAN THE ICE WAS THIN AND UNDERNEATH RAGED UNAPPEASED FIRES
SOME GLOWING DIMLY HAD PLODDED ON IN A SLOW DUMB FAITHFUL WORK WORTH WHILE
WHEN I THOUGHT THE ENDOWMENT SURE I MORTGAGED THE SCHOOL IN ORDER TO BUY TOLLIVER'S LAND
THE OTHER POISED BALANCED THE SLIM SWAYING BODY
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHO DESERVE MORE AND I DON'T SOMEHOW LIKE THE IDEA OF SEEMING TO HAVE WORKED HARD IN THE CAMPAIGN SIMPLY FOR MONEY OR FORTUNE
TEERSWELL DROPPED IN LATER AND BROUGHT HIS FRIEND STILLINGS
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT COLONEL CRESSWELL WILL ATTACH OUR COTTON FOR RENT AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES THE WAREHOUSE BUT IT'S OURS NOTHING IS OURS
THE COLONEL DID NOT STIR OR REMOVE HIS CIGAR
THEN A GIRL LITHE DARK BROWN AND TALL LEAPED LIGHTLY INTO THE PATH WITH GREETINGS ON HER LIPS FOR BLES
SHE ONLY HEARD THE PRATTLE OF THE BIRDS IN THE WOOD FAR DOWN WHERE THE SILVER FLEECE WOULD BE PLANTED
GOT MY LETTER YES HERE ARE THE THREE BILLS
BUT I CAN WORK AND I WILL--FOR THE WONDER THINGS--AND FOR YOU SO THE SUMMER YELLOWED AND SILVERED INTO FALL
WHY MISS CRESSWELL I--I JOHN TAYLOR FORSOOK SOCIAL AMENITIES AND PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER
A MAN CAME TO HIM A WHITE-FACED MAN WITH SLIGHTLY CURLING CLOSE GRAY HAIR AND HIGH-BRED ASCETIC COUNTENANCE
SHE HAD THOUGHTS AND NOTIONS OF THE WORLD WHICH WERE TO HIS SOUTHERN TRAINING HARDLY FEMININE
I DON'T SUPPOSE TAYLOR KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
THERE CAME WELLING TO HER LIPS A FLOOD OF THINGS THAT SHE WOULD KNOW
LATER MR EASTERLY TALKED A WHILE ON ROUTINE BUSINESS SAYING AS HE TURNED AWAY
MRS CRESSWELL HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOSSIP NO--WHAT THAT WYNN WOMAN THEY SAY IS A NIGGER
THEN WITHOUT WARNING SHE APPEARED IN THE COTTON-FIELD BESIDE BLES AND PICKED
YOUR EYES ARE DARKNESS DRESSED IN NIGHT TO SEE YOU BRIGHTER DEAR SHE SAID
YES WITH PLEASURE SHE SAID MOVING AWAY--AT FIRST VERY FAST AND THEN MORE AND MORE SLOWLY UP THE LANE WITH A PUZZLED LOOK ON HER FACE
HOW AM I TO KNOW THIS IS TRUE FOLLOW IT UP AND SEE HE MUSED
MISS SMITH WAS INVITED POLITELY INTO THE PRIVATE PARLOR
THE CONCENSUS OF SOUTHERN OPINION WAS THAT THE JUDGMENT HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND MRS CRESSWELL WAS CONVINCED OF THIS
HE IS COMING TO VISIT THE CRESSWELLS AND MISS TAYLOR SAILED TRIUMPHANTLY UP THE STAIRS
HER COMING SOUTH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOLELY FOR REASONS OF HEALTH AND HER APPEARANCE MADE THIS EXCUSE PLAUSIBLE
SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED
COLONEL CRESSWELL HAD NOTICED HER HESITATION AND THOUGHT OF IT AS HE SETTLED TO HIS CIGAR AGAIN
TODAY WAS THE LAST IN TOWN
SHE MUST LIFT IT SHE KNEW THOUGH IT WERE BIG AS A WORLD AND SHE PUT HER STRENGTH TO IT AND GROANED AS THE PORTER CRIED IN THE GHOSTLY MORNING LIGHT
WHERE HAD SHE LIVED THAT SHE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE BEFORE
EVERY DAY CAME THE CALL FOR MORE MORE--THIS GREAT GROWING THIRST TO KNOW--TO DO--TO BE
SUPPOSE YOU HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS FOR ONE WEEK FROM TODAY ALL RIGHT AND BLES ROSE
BUT SEE HERE
STILL INDIGNANT AND SURPRISED THE COLONEL LIFTED HIS VOICE SHARPLY
WELL--PARDON ME
IT'S COME!--THE SILVER FLEECE MISS SMITH WAS STARTLED
SUPPOSE HE ASKED CAROLINE WYNN TO HELP HIM IN THIS CASE
GOOD-NIGHT ALWYN ENTERED
THE SOUTH IS CLAMORING FOR A FIRST CLASSY EMBASSY APPOINTMENT
THE GIRL SHIVERED BUT STOOD ALOOF
BUT NEVER TELL ANYTHING THAT ISN'T THE TRUTH NEVER NEVER EVEN IF IT HURTS ME EVEN IF IT HURTS
THE GIRL DID NOT SHRINK BUT SHE PAUSED
DON'T FAIL
TREAT POOR ZORA A LITTLE MORE LOVINGLY AND BLES A LITTLE LESS WARMLY
WHAT'S OVER THERE HE ASKED POINTING NORTHWARD
WE GO AND COME AGAIN JUST AS WE WANTS TO
HE WROTE A SHORT LETTER WITH HIS OWN HAND AND SENT IT TO POST
THEN FAILURE MEANT BUT LITTLE NOW IT SEEMED TO MEAN EVERYTHING
I SHA'N'T DO IT SHE SAID
HARRY CRESSWELL ONLY SMILED DIMLY AND LOOKED INTERESTED
THRUSTING HER HAND IN HER POCKET IT CLOSED UPON HER HUSBAND'S CARD-CASE
YOU SEE MISS SMITH IS A SISTER OF A FRIEND OF OURS CONGRESSMAN SMITH OF NEW JERSEY AND SHE HAS JUST WRITTEN TO ME FOR HELP
I WAS WARNED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO SEE YOU SENATOR SMITH BUT I WOULD COME
SEE HERE I WANT LUNCH FOR TWO AT ONE O'CLOCK THE DIRECTIONS THAT FOLLOWED WERE EXPLICIT AND GIVEN WITH A PARTICULARITY THAT MADE SAM WONDER
IT'S WHERE THE DREAMS LIVES SHE WHISPERED
I MUST WALK OF COURSE HOWEVER SHE COULD NOT REFUSE TO LET HIM GO AT LEAST HALF-WAY OSTENSIBLY TO TELL HER OF THE COMING OF HER BROTHER
YOU SEE I TALKED AGAINST THAT VERY THING MISS WYNN'S EYES WIDENED
WHO THEN SHOULD BE NOMINATED
HE HAD TRIED INDEPENDENCE AND PHILANTHROPY AND FAILED
NO--DAMN IT!--OUTSIDE MILLS ARE LOW
A BROWN WELL-APPEARING YOUNG WOMAN OF NOTABLE SELF-POSSESSION
MRS VANDERPOOL STROLLED ALONE TO THE SCHOOL AND SAW SARAH SMITH
FOR A MOMENT ZORA PAUSED AND HER NOSTRILS QUIVERED
MISS SMITH STARTED FOR SHE WAS THINKING OF ZORA AT THAT VERY INSTANT
HOW DARE YOU SHE SCREAMED BESIDE HERSELF
SMITH WOULD KICK
ONLY MAXWELL WAS SILENT
HONEY HE SAID TREMBLINGLY I B'LIEVE WE CAN DO IT--IF COTTON GOES TO TWELVE CENTS WE CAN PAY THE MORTGAGE TWO MILES NORTH OF THE SCHOOL AN OLD BLACK WOMAN WAS SHOUTING AND WAVING HER ARMS
WHETHER YOU'RE SUITED TO IT OR NOT I DON'T YET KNOW BUT I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO SEE YOU SETTLED HERE IN A DECENT HOME WITH A FAMILY RUNNING A FARM
BUT--WOULDN'T THAT BE DIFFICULT WHY SHOULD IT BE I MEAN WOULD THE CRESSWELLS APPROVE OF EDUCATING NEGROES OH EDUCATING
REALLY NOW YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE IS A DANGER OF--OF AMALGAMATION DO YOU HE SANG
THIS NIGGER WENCH WROTE OUT SOME ILLEGIBLE STUFF AND COLONEL CRESSWELL SIGNED IT TO GET RID OF HER
THE WORLD WAS PEACEFUL
FAR OFF SHE HEARD THE YODLE OF THE GANGS OF PEONS
THE WOMAN WAS STRUGGLING WITH A CRIPPLED CHILD AND ZORA TURNING LIFTED HIM CAREFULLY FOR THE WEAK MOTHER WHO THANKED HER HALF TIMIDLY
ECHO OF THE SPIRIT OF AN OLDER DAY MISS SMITH SEEMED TO HER TO BE CRAMPED AND PARALYZED IN AN ARMOR OF PREJUDICE AND SECTIONALISMS
BESIDES THERE WAS THE ENDOWMENT
NO THEY ASK ONLY TO BE REGISTER AND ASSISTANT REGISTER OF THE TREASURY
BEHOLD THE SUPREME SACRIFICE THAT MAKES US CLEAN
BLES WALKED TOWARD THE SCHOOL
THE TROUBLE IS YOU SEE COLONEL CRESSWELL THE PRICE IS HIGH AND THE INTEREST HEAVY
I THINK I SHALL SEE IT THROUGH FROM SPEECH TO BALL YES I DO USUALLY MISS WYNN ASSERTED ADJUSTING HER FURS
IT WAS MONEY MONEY ALWAYS MONEY
WHAT WAS WASHINGTON AND WHAT WAS THIS FINE TALL QUIET RESIDENCE
THE SWEAT POURED FROM HIS FOREHEAD
THE CLEFT BETWEEN THE OLD SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY AND THE PUSHING NEW SOUTHERNERS
AS IT WAS SHE BEGAN WELL
HIS HEAD WAS BUSY WITH NEW THOUGHTS AND HIS LIPS WERE WHISTLING MERRILY FOR TODAY ZORA WAS TO SHOW HIM THE LONG DREAMED OF SPOT FOR THE PLANTING OF THE SILVER FLEECE
HARRY CRESSWELL DID NOT VOICE HIS MIND FOR HE WAS NOT WHOLLY DISPOSED TO WELCOME WHAT WAS THERE
AT ALL EVENTS SHE CONCLUDED THIS IS NO OPPRESSED PEOPLE AND SAUNTERING AWAY FROM THE REST SHE NOTED THE SMILES OF AN UNDERSIZED SMIRKING YELLOW MAN WHO HURRIED BY WITH A HANDFUL OF DOLLAR BILLS
SHE'S A PRETTY SHREWD PROPOSITION AND UNDERSTANDS THAT ALWYN'S ONLY CHANCE NOW LIES IN KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT
ZORA STOOD RIGID AND GRAY
THE GIRL WAS STARING SILENTLY AT THE MADONNA
COLONEL CRESSWELL LOOKED UP IN AMAZEMENT AND THE LAWYER DROPPED HIS GLASSES
WE CAN DEAL WITH THEM
BUT HE WENT ON
THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE NEED OF MR TODD'S EDUCATIONAL BILL
IT'S DE BOYS AGAIN HONEY SHE RETURNED SOLEMNLY
THE SENATOR WILL WANT TO SEE YOU I KNOW
WHO WOULD WIN--THE WITCH OR JASON
SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO RING BUT THE DOOR FLEW SILENTLY OPEN AND A MAN-SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HER
SHE WAS A PUZZLE TO HIM
SHE FOUGHT HER WAY WITH A DOGGED PERSISTENCE THAT BROUGHT WORD AFTER WORD OF PRAISE AND INTEREST FROM BLES
ESPECIALLY I MUST GET IN MISS WYNN'S SET SO THAT BOTH OF US CAN WATCH HER AND ALWYN AND MAKE HER FRIENDS OURS I'LL DO IT--SHAKE AND STILLINGS PUT HIS OILY HAND INTO TEERSWELL'S NERVOUS GRIP
SIX AND ONE-HALF CLICKED THE MACHINE
CAROLINE WYNN DEEMED IT A PART OF THE WHITE WORLD'S EDUCATION TO PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS LIKE THIS
WHILE MR EASTERLY STILL REGARDED TAYLOR'S LARGER TRUST AS CHIMERICAL SOME OCCURRENCES OF THE FALL MADE HIM TAKE A RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE TOWARD IT
YES SIR--SUCCESS
I AM A PERSON AND I AM SOUTHERN BORN
ONE BOY WITH THE INIMITABLE DRAWL OF THE RACE PUSHED BACK HIS ICE-CREAM AND ADDRESSED IT WITH A MOURNFUL HEAD-SHAKE
MISS SMITH WATCHED HER GO
BUT YOU SEE DEY WERE ARRESTED AND THEN CUNNEL CRESSWELL TOOK EM AND LOWED THEY COULDN'T LEAVE HIS PLACE
YOU CAN WHEEL THE PLANTERS INTO LINE--WILL YOU DO IT JOHN TAYLOR BENT FORWARD TENSE BUT COOL AND STEEL-LIKE
DID SHE WANT HIM TO FIND HER
HE HAD FAILED
IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN ONE WOULD THINK SHE RESPONDED
HE'S A FINE HONEST FELLOW VERY WELL
AND AS SHE SENSED THE HOT BREATH OF HIM SHE FELT HERSELF PURRING IN A HALF HEARD WHISPER
DO YOU KNOW--I'VE WONDERED IF--QUITE UNCONCIOUSLY IT IS YOU
IT WAS CERTAIN
DO YOU MEAN TO INTIMATE THAT MR ALWYN'S APPOINTMENT IS HELD UP BECAUSE HE IS COLORED I DO WELL--WELL THE SENATOR RANG FOR A CLERK
SHE HESITATED AND STARTED TO TURN AWAY
ZORA I AM SELFISH I KNOW BUT FIVE YEARS TRULY IS NONE TOO LONG
HE LOOKED AT HER AND SHE WAVERED SLIGHTLY UNDER HIS BLACK EYES
SHE SAW TOO HOW THAT THE LIGHT HAD NOT SIMPLY SHONE IN DARKNESS BUT HAD LIGHTED ANSWERING BEACONS HERE AND THERE IN THESE DULL SOULS
THEY SAY HE TALKED TO NOBODY ELSE AT HER PARTY
UNDERWEAR WAS DAINTIER
OR HAD IT BEEN SOME WITCH-VISION OF THE NIGHT COME TO TEMPT AND LURE HIM TO HIS UNDOING
BUT AS TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO COULD INFLUENCE THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE GETTING OR ABOUT TO GET WHAT THEY WANTED--THERE WAS A QUESTION
AND TOO THERE WAS MINGLED A VAGUE SENSE OF HAVING LOWERED HERSELF TO TOO FAMILIAR FELLOWSHIP WITH THIS--THIS BOY
SHE OUGHT NOT TO PASS THESE STUDENTS WITHOUT A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT OR INSTRUCTION
OF HER BROTHER WHO APPARENTLY NOTED NOTHING OF LEAVES AND WINDS AND SEASONS
NOT SIMPLY HERE BUT SHE HESITATED--"IN ENGLAND--IN FRANCE WILL IT TAKE LONG ZORA ASKED SMOOTHING THE LADY'S HAIR
HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OVERWHELM BOTH WITH AN UNFORGETTABLE REPRIMAND
AS SHE SLEPT AN OLD WOMAN CAME TOILING UP THE HILL NORTHWARD FROM THE SCHOOL AND OUT OF THE EASTWARD SPUR OF THE CRESSWELL BARONY
OUTSIDE THE WEATHER WAS GUSTY AND LOWERING WITH A CHILL IN THE AIR
CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL'S WIFE HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE AND TODD THINKS THEY'VE GOT THE SOUTH WITH THEM CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL'S WIFE EASTERLY'S FACE WAS ONE GREAT EXCLAMATION POINT
EVERY FOURTH OF A CENT FALL MEANT--HE FIGURED IT AGAIN TREMBLINGLY--MEANT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE OF LIABILITIES
SHE WAS SORRY SHE HAD SAID IT
BUT COULD SHE LIVE
HOW PRETTY SHE SAID TAKING IT AND LOOKING AT IT
A BITTERNESS DAWNED IN HER EYES
JUST AS I TURNED AWAY FROM HIM BACK TO MY PEOPLE I WAS TO HELP HIM TO THE HIGHEST
IT BEWILDERED ME WHEN I FIRST READ THE NEWS EARLY THIS MORNING
HERE JOHNSON THE FAITHFUL NIGGER WAS OF INCALCULABLE ASSISTANCE
BUT THEY DON'T GIT ME
SHE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY SO I TOLD HER $750,000 WOULD BE BETTER--$150,000 APIECE
NOW WHAT THE DEVIL DOES THIS MEAN I'M AFRAID SAID SENATOR SMITH THAT IT MAY MEAN AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF CRESSWELL'S FRIENDS TO BOOST HIM FOR THE FRENCH AMBASSADORSHIP
SAKES ALIVE CRIED MISS SMITH THROWING A SHAWL ABOUT HER AND LEANING OUT THE WINDOW
APPROACHING YOU AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LANDOWNERS OF ALABAMA ON A CONFIDENTIAL MATTER'--H'M--H'M--'A COMBINATION OF CAPITAL AND POWER SUCH AS THIS NATION HAS NEVER SEEN'--'COTTON MANUFACTURERS AND COTTON GROWERS
NO NEVER
THERE WERE HUSKY BIG-LIMBED YOUTHS AND BOLD-FACED LOUD-TONGUED GIRLS
SOON THE OFFICERS AND THE SPEAKER OF THE EVENING APPEARED
THAT IS AN AVERAGE WAGE TODAY THEY LOOK LAZY SAID MRS GREY
LET THE MILL-HANDS HAVE THE OFFICES
ALL THAT HAD FLOWN
SHE KNEW THAT IN HER PART OF THE COUNTRY ON THAT DAY THE BLACK POPULATION MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WERE GATHERED IN GREAT GROUPS
I WONDER WHY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE AND NOT THINGS IT'S PEOPLE IN THE SWAMP ASSERTED ZORA DREAMILY SMOOTHING OUT THE PILLOWS OF THE COUCH LITTLE PEOPLE I CALL THEM
SUCCESSFUL
HAVE I MADE MY CLOTHES AND FOOD
I HOPE I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR
SO HE MERELY REINED HIS HORSE TO THE BETTER PART OF THE FOOT-PATH AND RODE ON
GREY GIVES A DINNER 122 FOURTEEN
REALLY IT ISN'T WORTH WHILE PEERING BACK OF THINGS
THE OTHER TEACHERS WERE INDISTINCT PERSONALITIES ALWAYS VERY BUSY AND VERY TIRED AND TALKING SCHOOL-ROOM WITH THEIR MEALS
OH THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT OF COURSE
THERE ARE SO MANY AHEAD OF ME AND I AM IN A HURRY TO GET TO MY SCHOOL
BY THE WAY I LEARN FROM MISS SMITH THAT THE BOY BLES ALWYN IN WHOM ZORA WAS SO INTERESTED IS A CLERK IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON INDEED
SHE PRECEDED HIM UP-STAIRS TO THE SITTING-ROOM WHERE LEAVING THE DOOR AJAR SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND WAITED
A FEELING OF DESPERATION CAME OVER HER
A GREAT WHITE FOAM WAS SPREAD UPON ITS BROWN AND GREEN
HE SIGHED AND LYING BACK CLOSED HIS EYES AND THE BREATH CAME EASIER
WAS IT NOT A RATHER DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT
BEFORE SHE FELL ASLEEP SHE HAD DETERMINED TO HAVE A TALK WITH MRS VANDERPOOL
BUT MONEY WAS NEEDED TO DEVELOP AND RUN IT
SHE TURNED THE LEAVES TILL SHE CAME TO A PICTURE WHICH SHE STUDIED INTENTLY
IN THE SWAMP THE HIDDEN ISLAND LAY SPADED AND BEDDED AND BLES WAS THROWING UP A DYKE AROUND THE EDGE
NOW WHAT DO YOU KNOW SHE ASKED FINALLY ABOUT NEGROES--ABOUT EDUCATING THEM MR TAYLOR OVER HIS FISH WAS ABOUT TO DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF ANY SORT ON THE SUBJECT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE RECOLLECTED HIS SISTER AND A SUDDEN GLEAM OF LIGHT RADIATED HIS MENTAL GLOOM
BUT SHE FLASHED THROUGH THE LIGHTED DOORWAY AND WAS GONE FOLLOWED BY THE OATH AND SHOUTS FROM THE APPROACHING MEN
OF COURSE THERE'LL BE CONSIDERABLE TRAVELLING THE CHAIRMAN VENTURED LOOKING REFLECTIVELY OUT OF THE WINDOW
I'M GOING TO SET THE SHERIFF BEHIND THESE LAZY NIGGERS SAID THE COLONEL
THE TOWN POURED OUT TO GREET THEM--"THE MURDERERS
THE SECRETARY HESITATED A LITTLE WHEN THE TWO STARTED IN BUT MISS WYNN'S AIR WAS SO QUIETLY ASSURED THAT HE YIELDED
BLES SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY AND THEY WENT SILENTLY IN TO THEIR PEOPLE
MISS CAROLINE WYNN 199 TWENTY-THREE
YOU WERE WROUGHT UP TONIGHT NERVOUS--WILD
THAT COTTON MUST BE OURS HARRY--ALL OF IT
ALL THE VACATION DAYS BLES WORKED ON THE FARM AND ZORA READ AND DREAMED AND STUDIED IN THE WOOD UNTIL THE LAND LAY WHITE WITH HARVEST
BUT WE'D BETTER SEND HIM THE TWO PRIZE BALES
SHE SUPPLIED A SUB-COMMITTEE UPON WHICH HE WAS SERVING--NOT DIRECTLY BUT THROUGH HIM--WITH FIGURES WITH REPORTS BOOKS AND PAPERS SO THAT HE RECEIVED SPECIAL COMMENDATIONS
ALWYN AND ALWYN ALONE REALLY KNEW
I WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY SOUL COUNTS--WHITE BLACK AND YELLOW--ALL
AFTER SCHOOL HE WOULD GO AGAIN WORKING WHILE SHE WAS BUSY IN MISS SMITH'S OFFICE AND RETURNING LATER WOULD LINGER AWHILE TO TELL ZORA OF HIS DAY WHILE SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HER LITTLE TASKS
WHEN MISS SMITH FINISHED SHE HAD PAUSED AND FLICKING HER GLOVE MY DEAR MISS SMITH SHE SAID SOFTLY WITH A TONE THAT JUST ESCAPED A DRAWL--"MY DEAR MISS SMITH YOUR WORK IS INTERESTING AND YOUR FAITH--MARVELLOUS
MISS SMITH COULD SMELL IT YET AS SHE WENT DOWN THIS MORNING
CAROLINE WYNN SCRUTINIZED MRS VANDERPOOL BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SPEAKING WITH MR EASTERLY AND MR EASTERLY WAS A FIGURE OF POLITICAL IMPORTANCE
ELSPETH THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD IS NOT LONG DEAD
MRS GREY TALKED TO YOU MUCH YES ABOUT DARKY SCHOOLS YES WHAT DOES SHE INTEND TO DO I THINK SHE WILL AID MISS SMITH FIRST DID YOU SUGGEST ANYTHING WELL I TOLD HER WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT COOEPERATING WITH THE LOCAL WHITE PEOPLE THE CRESSWELLS YES--YOU SEE MRS VANDERPOOL KNOWS THE CRESSWELLS DOES EH
SUCH UNBELIEVABLE HERESY FROM A NORTHERNER OR A NEGRO WOULD HAVE BEEN NATURAL
THERE WAS A BIT OF FRIED CHICKEN BREAST SOME CRISP BACON BROWNED POTATOES LITTLE ROUND BEATEN BISCUIT AND ROSE-COLORED SHERBET WITH A WHIFF OF WINE IN IT
ITS EYES WERE WET WITH PAIN AND ANGER
THERE WAS NOT TO BE SURE ALL THE LUXURY THAT SHE WAS USED TO IN HER NEW YORK MANSION BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN FINISH ABOUT IT AN ELEGANCE AND STAID OLD-FASHIONED HOSPITALITY THAT APPEALED TO HER TREMENDOUSLY
SILENTLY THEY CONTEMPLATED THE LAND
BUT THEY'RE ALL ALIKE HER FACE GREW HARD
A HARSHER SHRILLER NOTE STRUCK IN AS OF MANY AND RUDER VOICES
HE KEPT ASKING
AT THE SAME TIME I RECOGNIZE THE INJUSTICE AND I HAVE COME TO SAY THAT IF YOU WILL WITHDRAW YOUR EXHIBIT YOU WILL BE GIVEN A SCHOLARSHIP IN A BOSTON SCHOOL I DO NOT WISH IT WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT I WAS NOT AWARE THAT I HAD ASKED FOR ANYTHING MRS CRESSWELL FELT HERSELF GETTING ANGRY
ALWYN ARRIVED AT WASHINGTON JUST AS THE MORNING PAPERS HERALDED THE SWEEPING REPUBLICAN VICTORY
WE MUST ALL LEARN SHE REPLIED WITH PENETRATION AND SO THEIR FRIENDSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED
YET SOMETHING HOLDS THEM APART AFRAID TO SHOW THEIR LOVE
WHAT YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM IS THE VOICE OF YOUR OWN SOUL BUT ZORA MERELY SMILED
A LOVE AFFAIR"--SHE PALED WITH SOMETHING LIKE FEAR--"AND I"--SHE STARTED TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT--"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ZORA ABOUT ZORA SHE GASPED WEAKLY
THIS MARRIAGE--OR RATHER THESE MARRIAGES--WERE NOT TO HIS LIKING
WE CAN'T TOUCH POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH
IT WAS SPRING AGAIN AND ZORA SAT IN THE TRANSFORMED SWAMP--NOW A SWAMP IN NAME ONLY--BENEATH THE GREAT OAK DREAMING
SHE'S A NURSE NOW AND I ASKED TO HAVE HER COME AND ATTEND YOU OH HE SAID OH HE LOOKED AT THE GIRL CURIOUSLY
OF COURSE MARY REFLECTED FROWNING AT THE FLOWERS--OF COURSE THIS MUST ALWAYS BE SO WHEN TWO HUMAN BEINGS ARE THROWN INTO NEW AND INTIMATE ASSOCIATION
SHE HAD A HARD TASK BEFORE HER
YOU'RE TRYING ON SOMETHING--HOW PRETTY AND BECOMING
THE SUN THE SWAMP
LIKE A HUNTED THING THE GIRL TURNED AND TWISTED IN THOUGHT AND FACED EVERYWHERE THE BLANK IMPOSSIBLE
IT LAY UNCUT AND SHIMMERING COVERED WITH DIM SILKEN TRACERY OF A DELICACY AND BEAUTY WHICH BROUGHT AN EXCLAMATION TO ALL LIPS
SHE HANDED OVER A TELEGRAM JUST RECEIVED FROM JOHN TAYLOR
TAYLOR ESPYING HIM LEAPT TO HIS FEET AND HAULED OUT HIS WATCH
BLES ALWYN THE FOOL YES SHE SLOWLY AGREED
SHE FELT IMPELLED TO GO FORWARD AND ASK--WHAT
ZORA WAS DREAMING AGAIN
NO I MEAN RUN THE SCHOOL TO SUIT THEIR IDEAS
HE WAS ASKED TO BE CO-WORKER--NAY IN A SENSE TO BE A FOLLOWER FOR HE WAS IGNORANT OF MUCH
SOME IS LITTLE AND BROAD AND BLACK AND THEY YELLS CHANTED THE GIRL
ZORA HESITATED
THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF
AFTER HE HAD GONE SHE WALKED SLOWLY TO ZORA'S ROOM AND OPENED THE DOOR
HE WAS TALL BLACK AND GAUNT PARTLY BALD WITH TUFTED HAIR
SHE SAT DOWN AND STARED DEATH IN THE FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
WHY YES SIR--IF YOU CAN SPARE ME SPARE YOU YOU BLACK RASCAL
ALL AT ONCE FROM FLOOR TO ROOF THE WHOLE SCHOOL-HOUSE WAS LIGHTED UP SAVE A DARK WINDOW HERE AND THERE
THE ALABAMA SENATORS WERE FIRMLY SEATED FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS AND THE GOVERNORSHIP HAD BEEN CAREFULLY ARRANGED FOR
HE GNAWED HIS MUSTACHE FOR ALREADY HIS QUICK CHANGEABLE NATURE WAS FEELING THE REBOUND FROM GLORY TO MISERY
AFTER ALL WHY SHOULD HE CARE
BUT HOW ABOUT THE SMITH SCHOOL
MONEY TO SEND EMMA OFF TO SCHOOL
HAS JOHN WRITTEN YOU SHE BEAMED SUDDENLY
SHE NEVER ASKED BLES TO HER HOME--TO THAT MYSTERIOUS BLACK CABIN IN MID-SWAMP
IT IS--BUT I MARVEL AT YOUR PENETRATION I MEAN IT IS MOVING--ALWAYS MOVING THE SWAMP SEEMED TO ME UNEARTHLY STILL YES--YES CRIED ZORA EAGERLY BRUSHING BACK THE RUMPLED HAIR
BUT FROM THIS UNDERTAKING MARY UNCONSCIOUSLY RECOILED
IT'S QUITE HEROIC OF COURSE BUT IT'S SHEER MADNESS AND I DO NOT FEEL I OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE IT
MRS VANDERPOOL HAD A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE OF BEING JUDGED OF BEING WEIGHED,--AND THERE AROSE WITHIN HER AN IMPULSE TO SELF-JUSTIFICATION
THE GRAY EYES TOOK ON THE FARAWAY LOOK OF A SEER
BUT THE OLD MAN SLOWLY DROPPED THE GIRL'S HAND AND LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH LIPS HALF SMILING
ABRUPTLY THE MUSIC FELL
THERE CAME A LOW KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
SHE WONDERED HOW SHE HAD DONE HER PART--HAD SHE BEEN TOO EAGER AND SCHOOL-GIRLISH
SHE WOULD CALL ON HER IMMEDIATELY AND BY AN OFFER OF ABUNDANT HELP INDUCE HER TO WITHDRAW QUIETLY
I MIGHT SPEAK AFTER YOU'RE THROUGH SHE SUGGESTED
FOR THESE A PRIZE OF A LONG-TERM SCHOLARSHIP AND OTHER SMALLER PRIZES WERE OFFERED
OUT OF PROTECTION OF WOMANHOOD AS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT SHE MUST BUILD RAMPARTS AGAINST CRUELTY POVERTY AND CRIME
BUT NO
BUT NO
GOD IS DONE SENT ME HE DECLARED IN PASSIONATE TONES TO PREACH HIS ACCEPTABLE TIME
SHALL I TRY IN ADDITION TO REFORM
YOU AIN'T BEEN NEAR BIG MEETIN'--AND--AND--YOU AIN'T SAVED HE HURRIED ON
HIS RESPECT SAID SARAH SMITH AND I KNOW THE WAY TWENTY-ONE THE MARRIAGE MORNING MRS VANDERPOOL WATCHED ZORA AS SHE CAME UP THE PATH BENEATH THE OAKS
DOESN'T CRESSWELL KNOW THIS OF COURSE
RUMATIZ IS KIND O BAD AND AUNT RACHEL AIN'T SO YOUNG AS SHE USE TER BE AND WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TOWN AFOOT THIS TIME OF DAY THE FACE FELL AGAIN TO DULL CARE AND THE OLD EYES CREPT AWAY
MISS TAYLOR TURNED UNEASILY IN HER BED AND JERKED THE BED-CLOTHES ABOUT HER EARS
THERE WAS A REAL SINCERITY IN THE TONE
ONE NIGHT A DEVIL COME TO ME ON BLUE FIRE OUT OF A BIG RED FLOWER THAT GROWS IN THE SOUTH SWAMP
WHO IS DIS WHAT TALKS OF DOING THE LORD'S WORK FOR HIM
IT WAS NEARLY A WEEK LATER BEFORE ALWYN APPROACHED HIM AGAIN
THEN SHE SIGHED AND SMILED AND BEGAN TO PLOT ANEW
THE PRESENT AMBASSADOR IS OLD AND--WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT AS I SAY IT'S POSSIBLE
GOOD-AFTERNOON AS MRS VANDERPOOL DROVE HOME SHE RELATED THE TALK TO ZORA
HE SPOKE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT HIS HEARERS SIGHED AND THEN SPRANG INTO A WHIRLWIND OF APPLAUSE
THE STORIES ESPECIALLY SHE DEVOURED--TALES OF STRANGE THINGS AND COUNTRIES AND MEN GRIPPED HER IMAGINATION AND CLUNG TO HER MEMORY
BUT HE AVOIDED THE LADY'S INQUIRING EYES
WE MUST LOSE NO FURTHER TIME BUT THERE'S NO TRAIN FROM TOOMSVILLE TONIGHT BUT THERE'S ONE FROM BARTON IN THE MORNING AND BARTON IS ONLY TWENTY MILES AWAY IT IS A LONG WALK ALWYN THOUGHT A WHILE SILENTLY
ZORA STOOD WIPING THE BLOOD FROM HER HANDS AND STARING AT BLES
AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MR TODD WAS USHERED OUT
SHE REDDENED DREW HERSELF UP AND THEN DROPPING HER PRIMNESS RIPPLED WITH LAUGHTER
WHO'S THAT A HARSH VOICE CRIED
WHY HAD NEITHER MARY NOR JOHN TAYLOR MENTIONED THIS
BUT DIDN'T YOU SAY THEY WERE ENGAGED I THINK THEY ARE
ABOUT HOW MUCH ASKED THE COLONEL
IT IS--TO NEGROES AND MANUFACTURERS BUT NOT TO PLANTERS BUT WHY DON'T THE PLANTERS DO SOMETHING WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH NEGROES HIS TONE WAS BITTER
I HAVE IT SAID TAYLOR
GENTLEMEN IT'S THE BIGGEST IDEA OF THE CENTURY
BUT HER HANDS WORKED NERVOUSLY AND WHEN HE THREW A BOOK WITH A PICTURE OF A MAN AND HALF-DRESSED WOMAN DIRECTLY UNDER HER EYES SHE TOOK IT AND DROPPED IT OUT THE WINDOW
MISS SMITH IS YO GOT JUST A DRAP OF COFFEE TO LEND ME
HIS MENTAL HORIZON WAS BROADENING AS HE PREPARED FOR THE COLLEGE OF NEXT YEAR
HE PAUSED ASTONISHED
ZORA SOUNDED MRS CRESSWELL'S VOICE
GOD KNEW
IT'S THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP AND WE MUST TAKE IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP GOOD OLD METHODS
YOU WROTE DIFFERENTLY AND HE OBEYED YOU NO
SOON SHE SAW WITH A CERTAIN GRIM SATISFACTION ZORA AND BLES EMERGING FROM THE SWAMP ENGAGED IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH A GREAT SPIDER SAT WEAVING HIS WEB
IT WAS HER FIRST LARGE CITY
THE GRATEFUL MOTHERS CAME OUT TWICE A WEEK AT LEAST
OUR LAND IS AS YOU KNOW GENTLEMEN WORTH AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
TEERSWELL RUSHED IN
HELEN AND HARRY SAID NOTHING OF THE CABLEGRAM TO THE PARIS TAILOR AND HELEN TOOK NO STEPS TOWARD HAVING THE CAMBRIC DRESS MADE NOT EVEN WHEN THE WEDDING INVITATIONS APPEARED
BUT I LET YOU THINK I WAS GIVING UP THE EMBASSY WHEN I NEVER INTENDED TO SHE SPOKE COLDLY YET ZORA KNEW
I EXPECTED A GREAT THING OF YOU--A SACRIFICE
BENEATH HER WAS AN ORDINARY PRETTY BALL--FLOWERED SILKED AND RIBBONED
I SEE THERE ARE NONE ON THE VINES YET
OWLS HOOTED IN THE FOREST
THE VINES AND BUSHES FOUGHT BACK WITH THORN AND BRAMBLE
YET SHE FOUND NEARLY ALL CAREERS CLOSED TO HER
SHE LAY STILL--DEAD
WELL IT WAS HER BLINDNESS AND SHE MUST RIGHT IT QUIETLY AND QUICKLY WITH HARD RUTHLESS PLAINNESS
I HELPED IN THE CAMPAIGN
SERIOUSLY THOUGH HE CONTINUED WE ARE NOT AS BLACK AS THE BLACKS PAINT US ALTHOUGH ON THE WHOLE I PREFER THAT HELEN SHOULD MARRY--A WHITE MAN THEY ALL GLANCED AT MISS CRESSWELL WHO LAY SOFTLY BACK IN HER CHAIR LIKE A WHITE LILY GLEAMING AND BEJEWELLED HER PALE FACE FLUSHING UNDER THE SCRUTINY
WHO'S THIS ASKED MISS TAYLOR
EXCUSING HIMSELF FROM HIS GUESTS HARRY CRESSWELL CAME INTO THE OFFICE
A PASSING BAND OF CONTRACT HANDS CALLED TO HER MOCKINGLY AND ONE BLACK GIANT LAUGHING LOUDLY GRIPPED HER HAND
THE PARIS OF CLOVIS AND ST LOUIS
BUT THE SILVERED GLORY OF THE MOON GREW FAINTER AND FAINTER AND EACH NIGHT IT ROSE LATER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE WORLD--EVERYTHING--SEEMED WRONG
THE GREAT TREES IN THEIR REGULAR CURVING ROWS MUST HAVE BEEN PLANTED MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY AGO
I HAVE NOT BEEN A GOOD MAN--MARY
THE GIRL'S GREETING WAS BRIEF ALMOST CURT BUT UNINTENTIONALLY SO AS ONE COULD EASILY SEE FOR BACK IN HER EYES LURKED AN IMPATIENT HUNGER
HE WALKED ON THINKING
MR CRESSWELL WON'T GIVE ME NONE AT THE STORE AND I'SE JUST STARVING FOR SOME SAID AUNT RACHEL FROM OVER THE HILL
WHO IS VANDERPOOL ANYHOW
I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU GENTLEMEN ARE IN THE COTTON BUSINESS FOR MAKING MONEY
WELL SHE HAD DONE HER DUTY AND SLOWLY SHE NESTLED BACK AND WATCHED THE FAR-OFF GREEN AND GOLDEN RADIANCE OF THE COTTON
THIS IS DEMOCRACY FOR YOU SAID HE WIPING HIS BROW
HE ROSE
HOW THEY WOULD SILENTLY HOOT AND JEER AT THE UPSTART WHO SUDDENLY CLIMBED SO HIGH AND FELL
IT IS BECAUSE THE WORLD THINKS ANY TRAINING GOOD ENOUGH FOR A FARMER THAT THE SOUTHERN FARMER IS TODAY PRACTICALLY AT THE MERCY OF HIS KEENER AND MORE INTELLIGENT FELLOWS
MORNING AND EVENING DAY AND NIGHT IT CROONED ITS RHYTHMIC TUNE
AND I BELIEVE I KNOW ONE SUCH MAN
IS YOU AFEARED HONEY HE SAW IN HER EYES SWEET YEARNINGS BUT COULD SPEAK NOTHING
ARE YOU DUMB
THE TRAINING OF ZORA 210 TWENTY-FOUR
SHE HAS GONE BACK NOW THEN THE GATE OPENED THE CROWD SURGED THROUGH SWEEPING THEM APART AND NEXT MOMENT HE WAS ALONE
SHE TRIED TO FOLLOW THE THIRD-READER LESSON WITH HER FINGER BUT PERSISTENTLY OFF SHE WENT DREAMING TO SOME EXQUISITE LITTLE PARLOR WITH ITS GREEN AND GOLD THE CLINK OF DAINTY CHINA AND HUM OF LOW VOICES AND THE BLUE LAKE IN THE WINDOW
BLES HANDED IT SILENTLY TO MISS TAYLOR
SHE WANTED TO SAY MORE--TO EXPLAIN TO ASK TO HELP
BUT IT HAPPENS THAT I HAVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON HAND WHICH WE PREFER HOWEVER TO LOAN IN ONE LUMP SUM
HE STARTED OFF AND HESITATED
ITS UNWRAPPING BROUGHT A CRY OF PLEASURE FROM THE LADIES
PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T MIND TAKING ME WHEN YOU CALL ALWYN REACHED FOR HIS HAT
WE BLACK FOLKS IS GOT THE SPIRIT
BUT PERHAPS ZORA WAS THE CHOSEN ONE
BIGGER BUT JOHN TAYLOR WAS DEAD IN EARNEST
OLD GEN'RAL CRESSWELL HAD NIGGERS AND ACRES NO END BACK DERE IN CAROLINA
DR BOLDISH WAS VERY HOARSE MR EASTERLY WAS GOING TO LOOK OVER SOME PLANTATIONS WITH COLONEL CRESSWELL AND MR BOCOMBE WAS ENGROSSED IN A NOVEL
THIS IS NOT THE END
SO ONE DAY IN TOWN HE DROPPED INTO CALDWELL'S EMPORIUM AND GLANCED HESITANTLY AT CERTAIN READY-MADE DRESSES
THEY WERE IN NO SENSE HER SORT OF FOLK
I BEGS PARDON MISTRESS--I BEGS PARDON
AND IT TAKES A LOT TO MAKE MAMMY AFEARED CAUSE SHE'S A WITCH AND CAN CONJURE
WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME MONEY--DO YOU KNOW WHY A FLASH OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS PASSED OVER THE GIRL'S FACE
THE VOICES OF MEN AND CHILDREN MINGLED WITH THE SNORTING OF ANIMALS AND THE CRACKING OF WHIPS
AND WITH RHYTHMIC SOUND AND SWING THE MIGHTY THRONG WAS DANCING
THE GRAY AND DRIZZLE OF DECEMBER WAS PAST AND THE HESITATION OF JANUARY
SHE ASKS SMITH TO MAKE HIM REGISTER
THINKING OF SENDING JESSIE TO BRYN MAWR BLES HEARD MISS JONES SAYING
I BLAME THE WORLD I AM THE WORLD MRS VANDERPOOL UTTERED HARSHLY THEN SUDDENLY LAUGHED
NO REVEALING WORD WAS SPOKEN
A LONG LOW DISTANT MOAN SEEMED TO SOUND UPON THE BREEZE AND AFTER IT CAME MARY TAYLOR
HE DIDN'T NOTICE TEERSWELL AS HE PASSED OUT
WHO IS IT THE BEST WOMAN IN ALL THE WORLD ZORA AND IS"--SHE STRUGGLED AT THE WORD MADLY--"IS SHE PURE SHE IS MORE THAN PURE THEN YOU MUST MARRY HER BLES I AM NOT WORTHY OF HER HE ANSWERED SINKING BEFORE HER
TONIGHT BLES CAME TO THE CABIN AND HE AND ZORA AND ELSPETH SAT SILENTLY AROUND THE FIRE-PLACE WITH ITS MEAGRE EMBERS
WHAT A CRAZY MUDDLE THE WORLD WAS
THE DEAD TRUNK OF A FALLEN TREE LAY STRAIGHT IN FRONT TORN AND TWISTED ITS TOP HIDDEN YONDER AND MINGLED WITH IMPENETRABLE UNDERGROWTH
THE COLONEL DISMOUNTED DESPITE HER PROTEST AND WALKED BESIDE HER
EVERY BIT
NOT CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY BUT IN GREAT BLURRED CLOUDS OF THOUGHT OF THINGS AS SHE SAID SLOWLY
MY GOD--IT WALKS--LIKE MY WIFE--I TELL YOU--SHE HELD HER HEAD SO--WHO IS IT HE HALF ROSE
I HAVE SEEN THE CRISIS APPROACHING FOR SOME TIME AND THE NEGRO BUSINESS SETTLES IT HE CONTINUED
BUT IF HIS OWN DESPAIR WAS GREAT HIS PAIN AT THE PLIGHT OF ZORA MADE IT ALMOST UNBEARABLE
IT NEVER DOES SAVE BY ACCIDENT I DO NOT THINK THAT IS QUITE SO ZORA PONDERED ALOUD AND I AM A LITTLE PUZZLED
MULES HITCHED TO LONG WAGONS BUGGIES AND RICKETY GIGS
BUT PSHAW!--HE POURED HIMSELF A GLASS OF BRANDY--WAS HE NOT RICH AND YOUNG
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO LITTLE THINGS PERHAPS PLACING A HAND GENTLY UPON ZORA'S SHOULDER SHE POINTED OUT A FEW ODD TASKS AND LEFT THE GIRL BUSILY DOING THEM
SHE BLUSHED AGAIN AT THE SHAME OF IT
HIS WIFE AND BABIES WERE ENJOYING LIFE AND HERE WAS THIS FOOL TRIAL TO UPSET MATTERS
TAKE NO THOUGHT BOUT DE MORROW
AND SINCE RIDICULOUS LAWS SAFEGUARDED THE PROPERTY IT WAS PERFECTLY PERMISSIBLE TO CIRCUMVENT SUCH LAWS
NEXT YEAR IT MIGHT HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE REGULAR INCOME AND THUS CUT OFF TWO TEACHERS
THE TOWN OF A SATURDAY NO LONGER BELONGED TO A HAPPY CARELESS CROWD OF BLACK PEASANTS BUT THE BLACK FOLK FOUND THEMSELVES ELBOWED TO THE GUTTER WHILE UGLY QUARRELS FLASHED HERE AND THERE WITH A QUICK ARREST OF THE NEGROES
SWEET POTATOES HOE-CAKE AND BUTTERMILK AND A HOG TO BE BARBECUED
AND THE TRUST HAD LEARNED A THING OR TWO ABOUT SOUTHERN GENTLEMEN
THE HALF MILLION WHITE FARMS ARE OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY FIVE THOUSAND WHOLESALE MERCHANTS AND THREE THOUSAND BIG LANDOWNERS OF WHOM YOU COLONEL CRESSWELL ARE AMONG THE BIGGEST WITH YOUR FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THIS SCHOOL WHEN I DIE WITH TREMBLING FINGERS SHE HAD SAT DOWN TO FIGURE HOW MANY TEACHERS MUST BE DROPPED NEXT YEAR WHEN HER BROTHER'S LETTER CAME AND SHE SLIPPED TO HER KNEES AND PRAYED
AND BLES--WAS MISS TAYLOR DECEIVED?--OR WAS HE CHUCKLING
THERE THERE COLONEL CRESSWELL DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME
THEN HE INQUIRED ABOUT ONE OR TWO OTHER PERSONS
HIDE YOUR GUNS WHY BLUSTERED ROB
ALL THIS LAY GROWING AND DEVELOPING
THE ROOMS OF THE COTTAGE WERE CLEAN AND LIGHT SUPPLIED WITH BOOKS AND PICTURES SIMPLE TOYS AND A PHONOGRAPH
ON HE TOILED IN MAD HASTE STRUGGLING TOWARD THE ROAD AND LOSING IT UNTIL FINALLY BENEATH THE SHADOWS OF A MIGHTY OAK HE SANK EXHAUSTED
MONEY TO FURNISH THEM RATIONS
I COULD NOT HELP IT
IT'S USELESS
THE POLISHED SHELL OF HIS CLAN REFLECTED CONVENTIONAL LIGHT EVEN MORE CAREFULLY THAN FORMERLY BECAUSE THE SHELL WAS COLD AND EMPTY
NO INDEED
NEITHER THE BOW THE LIFTED HAT NOR EVEN THE CONVENTIONAL TITLE OF DECENCY
NEGROES WOULD STEAL EVERYBODY SAID
HARRY WANTS TO GO TO CONGRESS THE JUDGE HESITATED
THE NEXT DAY NINE AND A HALF WAS THE QUOTATION AND MEN BEGAN TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND ASKED QUESTIONS
THE SKY WAS FLASHING TO DULL AND PURPLISH BLUE AND OVER ALL LAY THE TWILIGHT HUSH AS THOUGH GOD DID NOT CARE
WELL I AIN'T CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL WAS STIRRED TO HIS FIRST POLITICAL ACTIVITY BY THE HINT GIVEN HIM THROUGH STILLINGS
A LITTLE CHOKING CRY BURST FROM HER THROAT HER KNEES TREMBLED SO THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN
FOR A WHILE MARY TAYLOR SAT VERY QUIETLY
WHEN MRS HARRY CRESSWELL CALLED A MONTH OR SO LATER THE TALK NATURALLY INCLUDED MENTION OF ZORA
SHE WAS STRONG
FIRST IT WAS A LONG GAME AND HARRY CRESSWELL WAS NOT TRAINED TO WAITING AND SECONDLY IT WAS A GAME WHOSE INTRICACIES HE DID NOT KNOW
HER GARMENTS TWINED AND FLEW AROUND THE DELICATE MOULDING OF HER DARK YOUNG HALF-NAKED LIMBS
I'LL TRADE WITH YOU NOW FOR ANOTHER I HAVE DONE THE EXCHANGE WAS SOON MADE MISS WYNN TYING THE NEW ONE HERSELF AND STICKING A SMALL CARVED PIN IN IT
SHE HAD IDEALIZED FOR HER OWN USES A VERY HUMAN MAN WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN FULL OF SIN AND FAULT
MY HANDS ARE FULL OF OTHER MATTERS BUT IT'S PRECISELY THE ADVICE OF SUCH DISINTERESTED MEN THAT PHILANTHROPIC WORK NEEDS MR VANDERPOOL URGED
YOU SEE
HE TOLD STILLINGS SO AND TOLD HIM ALSO OF THE EVENING AND THE DISCUSSION
COME SHE SAID MRS GREY WE'LL TALK THIS MATTER OVER AGAIN LATER
NEXT DAY SENATOR SMITH HELD MISS WYNN'S LETTER UNOPENED IN HIS HAND WHEN MR EASTERLY ENTERED
BUT THE DAMNED SCOUNDREL WOULDN'T DARE HE DELIBERATELY PLACED HIS HAND IN HIS RIGHT-HAND HIP-POCKET AND THREW OPEN THE DOOR
WE'VE BEEN TOO MILD AND DECENT
I'VE GOT A LITTLE MONEY THAT MRS VANDERPOOL GAVE ME AND SOMEHOW WE MUST GET MORE
THAT'S THE MIRACLE OF IT--SHE'S THAT DEFT AND QUICK AND QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL
THEN HE TURNED TO ALWYN
TO BE SURE SHE MURMURED BUT WHAT SORT OF FOLKS GOD'S SORT OH WELL BUT MISS SMITH HAD THE BIT IN HER TEETH AND COULD NOT HAVE STOPPED
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP IN THIS SCHOOL A GIRL WHO NOT ONLY LIES AND STEALS BUT IS POSITIVELY--_IMMORAL MISS SMITH SMILED WHOLLY UNMOVED
TAYLOR DID NOT LOOK UP
PLAYFULLY HE CELEBRATED ALL HER BEAUTY UNCONSCIOUS OF TIME AND PLACE
I TELL YOU IT IS A DAMNED YANKEE TRICK HE WAS A MAN OF THIRTY-FIVE SMOOTH AND WHITE SLIGHT WELL-BRED AND MASTERFUL
THERE WERE PLENTY WHO COULD FAIL AND STUMBLE AND GIVE MULTIPLE EXCUSES
BLES WAS FULL OF HIS PLANS
NOW SEE HERE SAID COLONEL CRESSWELL THERE'S PRACTICALLY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH AND TIME PRICES
I THOUGHT IT WAS--CRESSWELL'S SHE SAID
BUT AS SHE WENT TO BED IN HER LITTLE WHITE ROOM SHE SAT WONDERING SADLY
GIVE UP ALL TO THE WEAK AND WRETCHED OF OUR PEOPLE
WHY DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS HE ASKED SUDDENLY
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN AS A CLERK AND I HAVEN'T SUCCEEDED YET
SITTING SHADED BENEATH THE STARS WHILE NEARBY BLINKED THE DROWSY LIGHTS OF THE GIRLS DORMITORY
THE DRESSMAKER WAS ON THE EDGE OF REBELLION
I BELIEVE THE REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO DO MORE TO DEFEND THEM AND I'M SATISFIED THEY WILL
AND HE SAT UP IN SUDDEN DETERMINATION AND LO
HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE OFFICIALS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE
THE WIND SCREAMED IN THE ANCIENT CRESSWELL OAKS AND SWIRLED ACROSS THE SWAMP IN LOUD WILD GUSTS
MARY TAYLOR LIKED IT ALTHOUGH SHE FOUND THE VANDERPOOL ATMOSPHERE MORE SUBTLY SATISFYING
THERE WAS NO PASSENGER EXCEPT ZORA
AS THE SPEAKER PROGRESSED A WHITE MAN CAME IN AND SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM
BY THE WAY THOUGH IF YOU DO GO TO THE SCHOOL IT WON'T HURT TO SEE THIS TAYLOR'S SISTER AND SIZE THE FAMILY UP PSHAW
I DID NOT CHOOSE IT
SHE BENT AND ROSE--HESITATED--SEEMED TO PLEAD
THE DIFFERENCE IS I THINK THAT THERE I KNOW HOW THE STORY WILL COME OUT
IT WAS MARY CRESSWELL AND SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM
SHE SILENTLY GATHERED UP HER SKIRTS AND WALKED QUICKLY AND CAREFULLY AWAY
COME UP TO THE HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON SHE SAID
AT LAST WITH A SIGH SHE AROSE TO HER FEET
THINK OF THE SERVILE BLACK FOLK THE HALF AWAKENED RESTLESS WHITES THE FAT LAND WAITING FOR THE HARVEST THE MASSES PANTING TO KNOW--WHY THE BATTLE IS SCARCELY EVEN BEGUN YES I GUESS THAT'S SO MARY BEGAN TO COMPREHEND
BUT ONE THOUGHT HELD AND BURNED HIM
WHICH WOULD THE SOUTH PREFER--TODD'S EDUCATION BILL OR ALWYN'S APPOINTMENT IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF CRESSWELL THAT THE SMALLER MATTER OF STILLINGS INTRIGUE SHOULD INTEREST HIM MORE THAN TODD'S MEASURE OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING
HE SAW THE HUGE FORM OF THE SHERIFF LOOM LIKE AN EVIL SPIRIT A MOMENT ON THE RISE OF THE ROAD AND SINK INTO THE NIGHT
IT'S TOO VALUABLE TO SELL THAT'S JUST IT
BEYOND THIS AND THEIR HAIR THERE WAS LITTLE TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM A MODERN GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN
THEY LOOKED OUT TOGETHER INTO THE DARKENING TWILIGHT
SHE SAW THE ACT
WHAT DAMNED MUMMERY IS THIS HE CRIED AND SNATCHING AT THE SHEET DRAGGED IT FROM THE BLACK DISTORTED COUNTENANCE OF THE CORPSE
THE OLD WOMAN WAS BENDING OVER THE FIRE STIRRING SOME SAVORY MESS AND A YELLOW GIRL WITH A WHITE BABY ON ONE ARM WAS PLACING DISHES ON A RICKETY WOODEN TABLE WHEN ZORA SUDDENLY AND NOISELESSLY ENTERED THE DOOR
GOOD-BYE BLES SHE SAID SLOWLY
THEY FELT AND SAW THE COLD WHITE MIST RISING SLOWLY FROM THE GROUND AND WATERS GROWING BLACKER AND BROADER
THEY ARE USED TO SEEING US EITHER SCARED OR BLINDLY ANGRY AND THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO HANDLE US THEN BUT AT OTHER TIMES IT IS HARD FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING BUT MEET US IN A HUMAN WAY BUT ZORA THINK OF THE CONTACT OF THE COURT THE HUMILIATION THE COARSE TALK ZORA PUT UP HER HAND AND LIGHTLY TOUCHED HIS ARM
IN A CLOSE ELECTION THE NEGROES OF NEW YORK OHIO INDIANA AND ILLINOIS CHOOSE THE PRESIDENT WHAT'S THE MATTER WELL BUSINESS INTERESTS HAVE DRIVEN OUR PARTY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE SOUTH
A WOMAN HURRYING OUT OF THE WESTWARD SWAMP UP THE PATH THAT LED FROM ELSPETH'S SAW HIM AND SHRANK BACK HASTILY
THAT WOULD BUY THE LAND TO BE SURE
BOTH SIDES WERE HONEST AND SINCERE ALL THROUGH THE DINNER MR SMITH HAD BEEN PREOCCUPIED AND TACITURN
MISS SMITH HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU MISS SMITH'S HAND TREMBLED A BIT
HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH MEN WAS NOT WIDE BUT IT WAS THOROUGH SO FAR AS HER OWN CLASS WAS CONCERNED
AFTER MISS TAYLOR CAME THERE HAD BEEN CALLS AND CASUAL INTERCOURSE TO MRS GREY'S GREAT GRATIFICATION AND MRS VANDERPOOL'S MINGLED AMUSEMENT AND ANNOYANCE
AROUND HER HUMMED THE SAME HOARSE CITY
AND THEN REDOUBLED SILENCE
COME AND GET WHAT YOU WANT--ANY TIME HE CALLED BACK
CRESSWELL READ IT THEN THREW IT ASIDE
THERE ARE A THOUSAND COTTON-MILLS IN THIS COUNTRY HALF OF THEM IN THE SOUTH ONE-FOURTH IN NEW ENGLAND AND ONE-FOURTH IN THE MIDDLE STATES
AND SECONDLY HE SEEMED TO KNOW EACH ONE THERE PERSONALLY AND INTIMATELY SO THAT HE SPOKE TO NO INCHOATE THRONG--HE SPOKE TO THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND THEY LISTENED AWESTRUCK AND FEARSOME
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND SHE PREFERRED TO SHARE THE LOT OF HER PEOPLE
IN THE SOUTH THE CRIES CONTORTIONS AND RELIGIOUS FRENZY LEFT HER MIND UNTOUCHED
HIS THEME WAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE NEGRO HIS ARGUMENT WAS COOL CAREFULLY REASONED AND PLAUSIBLE
SHE CAME UP NOW AND THEN AND SORTED THE LINEN AND PILED THE BASKETS FOR HER GIRLS
THEN HOARSE IRON THROATS WERE FILLED WITH FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF WHITE-FLEECED BLACK-SPECKED COTTON FOR THE WHIRLING SAWS TO TEAR OUT THE SEED AND FLING FIVE THOUSAND MILLION POUNDS OF THE SILKEN FIBRE TO THE PRESS
I GUESS IF HE WANTS IT TO GO ON HE'LL FIND A WAY
MRS VANDERPOOL IS RIGHT SHE CONFIDED TO THE NIGHT WITH SOMETHING OF THE AWE WITH WHICH ONE SUDDENLY COMPREHENDS A HIDDEN ORACLE
MR EASTERLY HAD DISCOVERED THAT HIS CHIEF CLERK'S SENSE AND EXECUTIVE ABILITY WERE INVALUABLE AND JOHN TAYLOR WAS SLATED FOR A SALARY IN FIVE FIGURES WHEN THINGS SHOULD BE FINALLY SETTLED NOT TO MENTION A GENEROUS SLICE OF STOCK--WATERY AT PRESENT BUT WARRANTED TO RIPEN EARLY
AND HE'D BEEN STARVING ON A BARE COUPLE OF THOUSAND AND TRYING TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES
OF COURSE IT WAS LONG AND WIDE
THE DISCUSSION THUS BEGUN AT MISS WYNN'S DID NOT END THERE
THE SAME GRIM EXCITEMENT THAT SENDS SMALLER SOULS HUNTING FOR BIRDS AND RABBITS AND LIONS HAD SENT THEM HUNTING THE ENEMIES OF MANKIND
HE MUST RUN--RUN AWAY FROM THIS WORLD AND FAR OFF IN SOME FREE LAND BEAT BACK THIS PAIN
ZORA LOOKED COLDLY DOWN UPON THE CHILD
SOMEHOW SHE HAD MISSED THE WAY TODAY
I NEED SOME READY MONEY SHE CONTINUED TO KEEP FROM CURTAILING OUR WORK INDEED I HAVE GOOD PROSPECTS IN A YEAR OR SO"--THE COLONEL LOOKED UP SHARPLY BUT SAID NOTHING--"AND SO I THOUGHT OF A MORTGAGE MONEY IS PRETTY TIGHT WAS THE COLONEL'S FIRST OBJECTION
YOU'LL HARDLY MISS ANY WORK ZORA DOES HE SAID
I HATES IT MIGHTY BAD TOO CAUSE I WANTED DE LITTLE CHILLENS IN SCHOOL
WITH HER BIT OF PROPERTY AND BRILLIANT PARTS SHE HAD HAD MANY SUITORS BUT THEY HAD BEEN REFUSED ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR REASONS SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE EXPLAINED
YES SIR GROWN ON MY PLACE BY MY NIGGERS SIR HE ASSURED THEM
THUS BEGAN IN THE DARK SWAMP THAT PRIMAL BATTLE WITH THE WORD
IT WAS ON THE EVE OF THE GREAT PARTY CONVENTIONS AND THE NEXT NIGHT SAM STILLINGS CAME AROUND TO GET SOME CRUMBS FROM THIS ASSEMBLY OF THE INNER CIRCLE INTO WHICH ALWYN HAD BEEN SO UNACCOUNTABLY SNATCHED AND OUTSIDE OF WHICH DESPITE HIS ENDEAVORS STILLINGS LINGERED AND SEEMED DESTINED TO LINGER
THE PHYSICAL CHANGE OF THESE THREE YEARS WAS MARVELLOUS
LESS THAN AN HOUR LATER HER HUSBAND ENTERED AND SHE WENT QUICKLY TO HIM
MRS STILLINGS DID NOT INTEND TO EXHIBIT AS SHE WAS SURE SHE WOULD NOT BE WELCOME
A WORD TO THE TAILOR GUARDED AGAINST THE LEAST SUSPICION OF INTRIGUE ENTERING BLES'S HEAD
GOOD-AFTERNOON AND SHE HAD RUSTLED GENTLY DOWN THE NARROW STAIRS LEAVING AN ALL BUT IMPERCEPTIBLE SUGGESTION OF PERFUME
THERE WOULD BE MRS GREY AND MARY TAYLOR MRS VANDERPOOL WHO HAD LEFT HER SO COLDLY IN THE LURCH BEFORE AND SOME OF THE CRESSWELLS
ARE YOU MEN FOOLS OR RASCALS
THEN TURNING CLASPED IN PASSIONATE EMBRACE THE CHILD WHOSE HEAD WAS HID IN ZORA'S GOWN
THE COLONEL AND HIS SON DROVE TO TOWN AND CONSULTED THE JUDGE
BUT THE MONEY
WOULD SHE GO
TALL DULL TREES STARTED DOWN UPON THE MURKY WATERS
HE FELT THE COMING OF SOME GREAT CALAMITY THE END OF A DREAM
EVERYBODY LIKES SOME KINDS OF WORK SHE INSISTED
MR TAYLOR WHO HAD NOT WAITED ON ANYBODY SINCE HIS MOTHER DIED AND NOT MUCH BEFORE FOUND A QUITE INEXPLICABLE PLEASURE IN THESE LITTLE DOMESTICITIES
HE HAD MOVED OUT OF EARSHOT AND WAS WAITING BY THE WINDOW
THIS MRS VANDERPOOL EASILY ASCERTAINED AND A CERTAIN SENSE OF JUSTICE COMBINED IN A CURIOUS WAY WITH HER POLITICAL INTRIGUE TO BRING ABOUT THE UNDOING OF MARY CRESSWELL
THIS MEANT A LONG DETOUR OF THE SWAMP TO APPROACH THE OAKS FROM THE WEST
SENATORS AND MILLIONAIRES
NOW IF I GET THE JOB HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY ASSISTANT LIKE IT
NOW DEAR DON'T MEAN MORE THAN I DO
THE TEACHERS KNEW
MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MRS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
HE HESITATED
IT WILL BE A LITTLE COSTLY THIS YEAR TOO SUGGESTED THE SHERIFF TENTATIVELY
I WAS THINKING YOU MIGHT SELL A BIT OF THE SWAMP CRESSWELL AND TAYLOR GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND THE COLONEL RE-LIT HIS CIGAR
HE WOULD HAVE SEEN LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE PLAIN ELEGANCE YONDER WHILE HERE HE SAW A JAPANESE VASE THAT COST NO CENT LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS
THEN A NAMELESS EXALTATION ROSE WITHIN HIS HEART
WHETHER I CAN YET SAVE IT GOD ALONE KNOWS
TO SEE THIS MIND STAND FIRM ON PRINCIPLE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SHE BELIEVED MEN NEVER STOOD
YET SHE HAD A CURIOUSLY SWEET WAY
SOON IT WOULD BE BURIED IN THE SWAMP WHENCE IT CAME
HE TOOK HIS HAT AND STARTED DOWN-TOWN
CRESSWELL AND STILLINGS HAD A LONG CONFERENCE AND WHEN STILLINGS HASTENED AWAY HE COULD NOT FORBEAR CUTTING A DISCREET PIGEON-WING AS HE ROUNDED THE CORNER
BUT ABOVE LAY THE VISION OF HER SCHOOL REDEEMED AND ENLARGED ITS FUTURE SAFE ITS USEFULNESS BROADENED--SMALL WONDER THAT TO SARAH SMITH THE FUTURE HAD SEEMED IN NOVEMBER ALMOST GOLDEN
WELL HE EJACULATED LOOKING QUICKLY UP AT EASTERLY
IT ISN'T WORTH THE COST
AT EVERY CABIN HE WHISPERED A WORD AND LEFT BEHIND HIM GREY FACES AND WHISPERING CHILDREN
FROM THE DARK BROWN OF ALWYN WHO WAS CUSTOMARILY ACCOUNTED BLACK TO THE PALE PINK-WHITE OF MISS JONES WHO COULD PASS FOR WHITE WHEN SHE WOULD AND FOUND HER GREATEST DIFFICULTIES WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO PASS FOR BLACK
NO SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN BEGAN THE COLONEL
THE LAND IS LEGALLY OURS AND HE HAS NO RIGHT TO OUR COTTON YES BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT NO MAN LIKE COLONEL CRESSWELL REGARDS A BUSINESS BARGAIN WITH A COLORED MAN AS BINDING
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO RISK
THE COMBINATION WAS SO FAR AS SHE HAD OBSERVED BOTH RARE AND TEMPORARY AND SHE WAS DISPOSED TO WATCH IT IN THIS CASE PURELY AS A MATTER OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY
SHE WAS TOO FULL OF HER OWN CARES AND TROUBLES AND SHE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD OF WILLING AND SYMPATHETIC EARS INTO WHICH TO POUR HER THOUGHTS
AND BESIDES HELEN WAS A CRESSWELL AND IT WAS TO BE EXPECTED AND SO FORTH
THE WORLD HAD DEALT CRUELLY WITH THE YOUNG DREAMS AND YOUTHFUL AMBITIONS OF THE GIRL
HE TURNED TO HER SUDDENLY AND SAID
SHE HAD ALWAYS NOTED HOW POLITE CONDUCTORS WERE TO HER AND MRS VANDERPOOL--WAS IT SIMPLY BECAUSE MRS VANDERPOOL WAS EVIDENTLY A GREAT AND RICH LADY
THEN WE'LL THINK FURTHER STILLINGS YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL BUT YOU'RE A GENIUS AND TEERSWELL FAIRLY HUGGED HIM
LET YOUR AMBITION BE TO SERVE RATHER THAN RULE TO BE HUMBLE FOLLOWERS OF THE LOWLY JESUS WITH AN UPWARD GLANCE THE REV
HE MEANT TO RENT HER THE LAND AND SIGN A RECEIPT FOR RENT PAID IN ADVANCE
ZORA I BELIEVE YOU'RE CRAZY SHE CRIED
BUT IT NEVER FELL
IT'S JUST AS I SAID GROWLED COLONEL CRESSWELL IF YOU DON'T WATCH OUT OUR WHOLE PLANTATION SYSTEM WILL BE RUINED AND WE'LL BE GOVERNED BY THIS WHITE TRASH FROM THE HILLS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY SIGHED CALDWELL THE MERCHANT
GOD IS GOOD HE WILL NOT LET IT HURT MUCH HE'S A FAIR GOD AIN'T HE SHE MUSED SCANNING THE EVENING SKY
GREY GIVES A DINNER THE HON
IT WAS A GREAT TEMPTATION
I'SE THOUGHT IT ALL BEFORE
COLONEL CRESSWELL MADE A SUDDEN RESOLVE
FAR DOWN IN THE FIELD OF THE FLEECE ZORA LAY CURLED BENEATH A TALL DARK TREE ASLEEP
ALL ROUND THE ROOM STOPPING ONLY AT THE FIREPLACE RAN LOW SHELVES OF THE SAME YELLOW PINE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND MAGAZINES
FOR INSTANCE ALL THESE NEGROES ARE AS YOU KNOW OF WRETCHEDLY LOW MORALS
HERE WAS A UNIQUE THING AND SHE CLIMBED TO HER BEDROOM AND STARED AT THE STARS
HE HATES ALL EVIL BUT WHY IS LIES EVIL BECAUSE THEY MAKE US DECEIVE EACH OTHER IS THAT WRONG YES ZORA BENT FORWARD AND LOOKED SQUARELY INTO MISS TAYLOR'S BLUE EYES
YOU MAY FIND YOUR LANDLORD HONEST AND THE WAY CLEAR
I'M PLAYING A BIG GAME--A TREMENDOUS ONE
WHY YES--YES OF COURSE THERE WAS A LONG TENSE SILENCE
THE AROMA OF COFFEE AND ROASTING MEAT ROSE IN THE DIM COOL SHADE
MISS SMITH WAS NOT TO BE EASILY QUESTIONED ON THE SUBJECT
SHE'S A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL SAUCE THAT STIRS MY RAPIDLY FAILING MENTAL APPETITE
MY FATHER WRITES ME THAT THEY ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF EXPECTING MONEY RIGHT OFF--IS THAT TRUE
I SUPPOSE HE THINKS WE DINE THERE OCCASIONALLY THE OLD MAN CHUCKLED
HARRY CRESSWELL LEFT ALONE RANG THE BELL FOR THE BUTLER
THE ROAD SWUNG PAST THE IRON WATERING TROUGH TURNED SHARPLY AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE PERT COTTAGES AND A STATELY HOUSE OLD AND FADED OPENED INTO THE WIDE SQUARE
THEN A POLICEMAN CAME BY AND LOOKED AT HER
HE BELIEVED IN AN ARISTOCRACY OF TALENT ALONE AND SECRETLY DESPISED COLONEL CRESSWELL'S PRETENSIONS OF BIRTH
TEERSWELL WAS FURIOUS AND BEGAN TO PLOT VENGEANCE
THEN SHE CAME IN GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM
WHEN ZORA LEFT COLONEL CRESSWELL'S ABOUT NOON THAT SUNDAY SHE KNEW HER WORK HAD JUST BEGUN AND SHE WALKED SWIFTLY ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS CALLING HERE AND THERE
I DID BUT GOIN INTO POLITICS--HAVING ENTERED THE POLITICAL FIELD I CAME HERE
IT SEEMED INDEED A HOPELESS TASK
QUICKLY SHE UNFASTENED THE PIECES OF THE FENCE LED THE ANIMAL THROUGH AND SPLICED THEM AGAIN
THE SMALL MILLS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BUY COTTON WHEN IT WAS LOW BECAUSE CRESSWELL WAS CORNERING IT IN THE NAME OF THE FARMERS LEAGUE
I HEARD ALL HE SAID
HE PAUSED HOWEVER IN HIS THOUGHT
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER UNTIL MRS CRESSWELL'S PLAN FOR AN ALL-SOUTHERN ART EXHIBIT IN WASHINGTON THAT MRS VANDERPOOL IN A FLASH OF INSPIRATION SAW HER CHANCE
THEY LIVE WHERE THEY PLEASE AND DO AS THEY PLEASE CRESSWELL EXPLAINED
THE BENIGN OLD JUDGE WITH HIS SAINTLY FACE AND WHITE HAIR SUGGESTED THAT SHE LAY ASIDE HER WRAPS AND SPEND THE AFTERNOON BLES AROSE TO HIS FEET
SWALLOWING HARD MISS SMITH SPOKE
BENDING SHE LISTENED HER EYES SHINING HER LIPS APART HER BOSOM FLUTTERING AT THE WELL-KNOWN STEP
THEN BEGAN TOO THAT LONG AND SUBTLE CHANGE WHEREIN A SOUL UNTIL NOW UNMINDFUL OF ITS WRAPPINGS COMES SUDDENLY TO CONSCIOUSNESS OF BODY AND CLOTHES
HOW PRACTICAL HE SAID
MR ALWYN SHE SAID GRACIOUSLY RISING
THE SUN BLAZED
ONCE OUT OF HEARING SHE THREW AWAY HER HAT AND BENDING FORWARD RAN THROUGH THE SWAMP
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
I BELIEVE IN SILENCE AT TIMES AH
THE SUN WAS STRONG AND HIGH THE MORNING FRESH AND VIGOROUS
THE DIRT THE SMELL THE SQUALOR
THERE'S DYNAMITE IN THIS RACE PROBLEM FOR AMATEUR REFORMERS BUT FORTUNATELY YOU HAVE AT HAND WISE AND SYMPATHETIC ADVISERS IN THE CRESSWELLS MRS GREY AGREED ENTIRELY
REMEMBER ZORA--NOT A WORD AND ALL THIS TO ZORA SEEMED NO SURPRISE
SHE FELT IT NOW AND SHIVERED IN THE WARM BREEZE
SHE WAS BLACK AND LITHE AND TALL AND WILLOWY
HOW GOOD AND COOL THE WATER FELT
YOU SEE MY PLAN WAS ALL SO SPLENDID
I WONDER WHAT I SHALL MAKE OUT OF HER QUERIED MRS VANDERPOOL
THERE IS NO WAY
JOHNSON HE INFORMED THE OTHERS HAS SNEAKED OVER TO CRESSWELL'S TO TELL OF THIS MEETING
SO LONG AS SHE WAS UNCERTAIN OF HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD HER IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACT
MRS GREY'S DECISION WAS DUE IN NO LITTLE WAY TO MARY TAYLOR'S REPORTS
OR RATHER IF SHE IS DRIVEN IT MAY ROUSE IN HER THE DEVIL INCARNATE
SHE STOOD LIKE STONE WITHOUT A QUIVER
HER FACE WAS HEAVY AND HOMELY UNTIL SHE LOOKED UP AND LIFTED THE DROOPING CHEEKS AND THEN KINDLY OLD EYES BEAMED ON THE YOUNG TEACHER AS SHE CURTSIED AND CRIED
MONEY SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO MISS SMITH
I CAN'T SEND THE CHILLUNS DIS TERM MISS SMITH
WHY HAD IT NOT OCCURRED TO HER BEFORE IN HER BLINDNESS
HERE ARE CENSUS FIGURES HE SAID COMMERCIAL REPORTS AND LETTERS THEY PORED OVER THEM A HALF HOUR
IT'S A LIE
SHE STOPPED ON HER WAY TO THE DOOR TO ADMIRE A BRONZE STATUETTE AND FIND TIME TO THINK
OH I SEE
THE FOOLISH PHANTASY PASSED WITH THE SECOND OF TIME THAT BROUGHT IT AND MRS VANDERPOOL'S EYES DROPPED AGAIN TO HER PAPER TO THOSE LINES THE PRESIDENT HAS SENT THE FOLLOWING NOMINATIONS TO THE SENATE
I'M INTERESTED IN ALWYN
HEREAFTER I'LL SEND THE CLOTHES DOWN
SOME OF THEM MAY--MOST OF THEM WON'T
BUT TO MISS TAYLOR
MR BOCOMBE COUNTED THEM AND ESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF WORK LOST AT TEN CENTS AN HOUR
THEREFORE HE MUST SUCCEED AND SUCCEED AT ONCE
THINK AND WALK--AND REST SHE CONCLUDED
SEVENTEEN THE RAPE OF THE FLEECE WHEN SLOWLY FROM THE TORPOR OF ETHER ONE WAKENS TO THE MISTY SENSE OF ETERNAL LOSS AND THERE COMES THE EXQUISITE PRICK OF PAIN THEN ONE FEELS IN PART THE HORROR OF THE ACHE WHEN ZORA WAKENED TO THE WORLD AGAIN
HE APPEALS TO ME
THEY WERE GENTLEMEN
I KNOWS WHERE IT IS AND I DON'T FEAR CONJURE YOU MUSTN'T STEAL ZORA SAID BLES GRAVELY
BUT I DID NOT LISTEN LIKE A LOG BUT POSITIVELY AND ELOQUENTLY
I DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS AND HURRYING UP A WEDDING-GOWN HE GROWLED
IT WAS LONG SINCE SHE HAD SLEPT IN THE DAYTIME AND SHE WAS ANNOYED AT SUCH LAZINESS
MR EASTERLY HEARD THE MATTER CAREFULLY AND WAVED IT ASIDE
THE CONGRESSMAN MADE AN EXCELLENT SPEECH
THE POOR WHITES SAW A CHANCE TO WIN TAYLOR'S INFLUENCE AND THE SHERIFF APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY
THE SWAMP THE ETERNAL SWAMP HAD BEEN DRAINED IN ITS DEEPEST FASTNESS
WHOSE CHILD IS THIS QUERIED MARY CURIOUSLY
NOW WHERE IS THAT PAPER ZORA POINTED SILENTLY TO THE COMPLAINT
THUS A LOW AND WIDE CATHEDRAL ALL GREEN AND SILVER IN THE STAR-LIGHT LAY PACKED WITH A LIVING MASS OF BLACK FOLK
THE SAME COMPANY BUT NOT THE SAME CONVERSATION
HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER
NOW THEY ENTERED THE SLIME
GOOD-BYE--COME AGAIN SHE BOWED HIM GRACIOUSLY OUT AND PAUSED TO TAKE THE MAIL FROM THE BOX
WE MUST HAVE LAND--OUR OWN FARM WITH OUR OWN TENANTS--TO BE THE BEGINNING OF A FREE COMMUNITY MISS SMITH THREW UP HER HANDS IMPATIENTLY
MRS GREY'S CHEF WAS HIGH-PRICED AND EFFICIENT AND HER BUTLER WAS THE ENVY OF MANY
THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU MISS SMITH
FOR HERSELF SHE ASKED NOTHING ONLY HIS WORD HIS CONFIDENCE HIS PROMISE TO TRY
ONLY NOW AND THEN WHEN THEIR EYES MET SUDDENLY OR UNTHINKINGLY A GREAT KINDLING FLASH OF FLAME SEEMED STRUGGLING BEHIND SHOWERS OF TEARS UNTIL IN A MOMENT SHE SMILED OR SPOKE AND THEN THE DROPPING VEIL LEFT ONLY THE FRANK OPEN GLANCE UNWAVERING SOFT KIND BUT NOTHING MORE
THEY WERE BENT TO THE CHASE SCENTING THE GAME KNOWING THE INFINITE MEANING OF THEIR HUNT AND THE GLORY OF VICTORY
SLOWLY HE LIGHTED A CIGARETTE OPENED THE GREAT LEDGER AND COMPARED THE COTTON-CHECK WITH IT
OR WAS IT SIMPLY A BRUTE FACT REGARDLESS OF BOTH OF THEM
SHE FOUND HERSELF SHRINKING AWAY AND GRIPPING HERSELF LEST THEY SHOULD PERCEIVE
GOOD-BYE--ZORA HE SOBBED AND WAS GONE
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN REAL
HE WAS NEARLY SEVEN FEET HIGH AND BROAD-SHOULDERED YELLOW WITH CURLING HAIR AND LAUGHING BROWN EYES
MEANTIME COLONEL CRESSWELL'S LAWYER WAS ON HIS FEET AND HE ADOPTED HIS MOST IRRITATING AND CONTEMPTUOUS MANNER
THE PLAIN UNWELCOME TRUTH WAS THAT HER HUSBAND HAD NO GREAT INTERESTS IN LIFE IN WHICH SHE COULD FIND PERMANENT PLEASURE
THE HONEST AND UPRIGHT ARE A SAD MINORITY
THIS SYSTEM CAN'T LAST ALWAYS--SOMETIMES I THINK IT CAN'T LAST LONG
WHAT'S YOUR NAME BUDDY--I'SE ONE OF AUNT RACHEL'S CHILLUNS AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE BUDDY I LIVES WITH GRANNY ON DE UPPER PLACE WELL I'LL SEE AUNT RACHEL AND ASK HER TO SEND YOU TO SCHOOL WON'T DO NO GOOD--SHE DONE AST AND MR CRESSWELL HE SAY HE AIN'T GOING TO HAVE NO MORE OF HIS NIGGERS BUT MR CRESSWELL CAME OUT JUST THEN AND WITH HIM A BIG FAT AND GREASY BLACK MAN WITH LITTLE EYES AND SOFT WHEEDLING VOICE
HE SIMPLY WROTE A CHECK AND THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
IT WOULD BE SHIPPED AT THE EARLIEST CONVENIENCE BUT IT COULD HARDLY CATCH THE NECESSARY BOAT
LAY NOT THESE WORDS ASIDE FOR A MOMENT'S PHANTASY BUT LIFT UP THINE EYES UPON THE HORROR IN THIS LAND;--THE MAIMING AND MOCKING AND MURDERING OF MY PEOPLE AND THE PRISONMENT OF THEIR SOULS
OF COURSE
CRESSWELL LOOKED AT HER AS SHE ENTERED THE LIBRARY WHERE HE WAS WAITING AND SMOKING
I TELL YOU MR EASTERLY I OBJECT--IT MUSTN'T GO THROUGH HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
WHEN OUR PEOPLE MEET WE OUGHT TO TALK OF OUR SITUATION AND WHAT TO DO AND MISS WYNN CONTINUED TO SMILE
SHE PRAISED THEIR WAY OF ADOPTING CHILDREN INTO THEIR OWN HOMES
WHITE PEOPLE RULE HERE JOHN TAYLOR FROWNED AND LOOKED A LITTLE PUZZLED
MANY FACTORS WERE INVOLVED THAT WERE QUITE FOREIGN TO THE OLDER WOMAN'S NATURE AND TRAINING
WHERE CAN WE GET LAND WITH CRESSWELL OWNING EVERY INCH AND BOUND TO DESTROY US ZORA SAT HUGGING HER KNEES AND STARING OUT THE WINDOW TOWARD THE SOMBRE RAMPARTS OF THE SWAMP
THE FIGHT WAS BECOMING A LITTLE TOO DESPERATE EVEN FOR HER STEADY NERVES
THE WORLD WAS GOLDEN WITH JASMINE AND CRIMSON WITH AZALEA
IN THE LONG RUN PUBLIC OPINION DETERMINES ALL WAGE BUT IN MORE PRIMITIVE TIMES AND PLACES PRIVATE OPINION PERSONAL JUDGMENT OF SOME MAN IN POWER DETERMINES
SHE WAS SURE HE WOULD FAIL IN THE END AND SHE WANTED HIM TO FAIL
HE HEARD THAT SHE WAS DOWN-STAIRS AND RAN TO MEET HER WITH BEATING HEART
FIRST COTTON FARMS ARE NOT GETTING SMALLER
MRS VANDERPOOL WAS AMUSED
IT WAS NOT THE SOFT ROLLICKING LAUGHTER OF BLACK MEN BUT THE KEENER MORE METALLIC SOUND OF WHITE MEN'S CRIES AND BLES ALWYN PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD LOOKED BACK AND HESITATED BUT DECIDED AFTER A MOMENT TO GO HOME AND TO BED
THE WHITE OPERATORE IN YONDER TOWN HAD BUT TO FLASH THE NEWS NEGROES KILLING WHITES TO BRING ALL THE COUNTRY ALL THE STATE ALL THE NATION TO RED VENGEANCE
HE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN CAME SLOWLY ONWARD DOGGEDLY DRUNKENLY WITH TORN CLOTHES FLYING COLLAR AND RED EYES
BUT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT HIS ILL-TEMPER WAS DUE TO A PARAGRAPH IN THE MORNING PAPER
THE SCHOOL 12 THREE
MISS SMITH STOOD FOR A MOMENT AND CLOSED HER EYES UPON A VISION
BUT SUPPOSE THEY DO FOR INSTANCE
TO BE SURE MR TAYLOR HAD BUT A MODEST SALARY AND NO FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS BUT HE HAD KNOWLEDGE AND BUSINESS DARING--EFFRONTERY EVEN--AND THE DETERMINATION WAS FIXED IN HIS MIND TO BE A MILLIONAIRE AT NO DISTANT DATE
EVERYTHING OUGHT TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL PERHAPS IT OUGHT TO BE SO ADMITTED BLES BUT IT ISN'T ISN'T IT SO--ANYWHERE I RECKON NOT
AND YET BLES WAS SURPRISED FOR EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT HER--HER VOICE HER BEARING THE SET OF HER GOWN HER GLOVES AND SHOES THE WHOLE IMPRESSION WAS--BLES HESITATED FOR A WORD--WELL WHITE YES--YES MA'AM HE STAMMERED BECOMING SUDDENLY CONSCIOUS THAT THE LADY HAD NOW A SECOND TIME ASKED HIM IF HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH SENATOR SMITH
THE WOMAN PEERED AT HER DOUBTINGLY
THEN SHE LOOKED DOWN TO THE NEW EDGE OF THE SWAMP BY THE OLD LAGOON AND SAW BLES ALWYN STANDING THERE
THAT SAMUEL STILLINGS HAD BEEN NOMINATED AND CONFIRMED AS REGISTER OF THE TREASURY AND THAT MR TOM TEERSWELL WAS TO BE HIS ASSISTANT
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD SEEN THE TEARS IN HIS EYES
THE HUM OF VOICES AND THE BUSY MOVEMENTS OF INDUSTRIOUS TEACHERS FILLED THE DAY
THE STEEL TRUST OWNS ITS IRON MINES OF COURSE--MINES COULD BE MONOPOLIZED AND HOLD THE TRUST UP
BUT I DO NOT KNOW MR ALWYN I THOUGHT YOU DID
THERE WAS JUST THE TOUCH OF EARLY AUTUMN CHILL IN THE AIR WITHOUT THAT MADE BOTH THE FIRE AND THE TABLE WITH ITS SOFT LINEN GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AND TWINKLING GLASSES A WARMING SATISFYING SIGHT
HER HEART WAS WRUNG
THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE COTTON SCHEDULE MEETS TONIGHT--VERY IMPORTANT
OF COURSE THOUGH THAT MAY NOT APPEAL TO YOU AND I CAN ONLY BEG YOUR GOOD OFFICES IN CHARITY IF--IF YOU SEE YOUR WAY TO HELP US
THEN EASTERLY AROSE
CHARACTERISTICALLY SHE STARTED DRAMATICALLY AND LARGELY
AND WHY ARE YOU AFRAID FOR HER THE MEN THERE ARE BEGINNING TO NOTICE HER WHERE AT ELSPETH'S DO YOU STAY THERE NOW YES WHY HE WANTS ME TO MUST YOU DO AS HE WANTS YES
A LONG SILENCE
THE CRESSWELLS IN THEIR NEW WEALTH THE MAXWELLS AND TOLLIVERS IN THE NEW PINCH OF POVERTY STRETCHED LONG ARMS TO GATHER IN THE TENANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN
I'M ALWAYS LOSING MY GLASSES AND THEY GET DIRTY AND--OH DEAR
BUT IF SHE TALKED AGAIN OF MERE MEN WOULD THESE DEVOTEES LISTEN
BUT SHE SAID NOTHING MORE AND NODDING TO HIS POLITE BOW DEPARTED
THEY ARE LAZY SAID MR CRESSWELL
OF LOUIS THE GREAT AND NAPOLEON III
THE JOY OF THE TWO SO MADLY CRAVED EXPRESSION THAT THEY BURST INTO SINGING
SHE DISMISSED THE GIRL WITH A KISS AND STOOD STILL A MOMENT CONSIDERING
ZORA AS FOR SOME LOST SOUL
HE HARDLY WAITED FOR RECOGNITION FROM THE SLIGHTLY ASTONISHED PRESIDENT BUT FAIRLY BURST INTO SPEECH
FIND OUT FOR US JUST WHAT THIS REVOLT IS HOW FAR IT GOES AND WHAT GOOD MEN WE CAN GET TO SWING THE DARKIES INTO LINE--SEE VERY GOOD THE SENATOR ACQUIESCED
SHE MUST MAKE HERSELF LEADER OF THE SOUTHERN SET IN WASHINGTON AND CONCENTRATE ITS WHOLE FORCE ON THE APPOINTMENT OF HARRY CRESSWELL AS AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE
THE DAMNED YANKEES HE SNEERED
YOU ARE NOT FOOLISH FOR THE FOOLISH LEARN
WE'LL LOOK THIS YOUNG MAN UP HE DECIDED
SENATOR SMITH LOOKED AT THE TALL STRAIGHT BLACK MAN WITH HIS SMOOTH SKIN AND FRANK EYES
DON'T ASK
THE RAPE OF THE FLEECE 154 EIGHTEEN
HE WAS WORTH TRYING AT ANY RATE
YOU MIGHT MAKE A GOOD COOK OR A MAID I HATE COOKING
HE AND THE INNER CIRCLE WENT OVER MATTERS CAREFULLY
THERE IS NO EARTHLY USE STRIVING FOR SUCH BLOCKHEADS
THEN HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE PRICES INDUCED THE PRICES TO FOLLOW HIM
BUT SHE WAS WONDERING JUST WHAT SPECTACLES HAD TO DO WITH THE COMPLAINT SHE HAD BROUGHT TO THE OFFICE FROM MISS TAYLOR
THE FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OF THE TOLLIVER PLANTATION WHICH THE SCHOOL NEEDED SO SADLY FOR ITS FARM AND COMMUNITY
SHE GLANCED DOWN THE COLUMN
THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER
SHE LOOKED AT HIM--A LONG FIXED PENETRATING LOOK WHICH REVEALED MORE THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THEN TURNED AWAY AND WENT SLOWLY UP-STAIRS
I TRIED TO GET THE BANK TO TAKE THE MONEY BACK BUT THEY REFUSED
THEN CAME JOHNSON
YES SAID MRS VANDERPOOL
I'LL SEND OH NO
WE TURN UP THE EARTH AND SOW IT SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS
THERE SHE LIVED AND WITH HER A HALF-DOZEN ORPHAN GIRLS AND CHILDREN TOO YOUNG FOR THE BOARDING DEPARTMENT OF THE SCHOOL
FIRST LET MR EASTERLY GET SMITH EASTERLY TURNED TO THE TELEPHONE
BUT PSHAW
WE ARE IN DEBT AS YOU KNOW FORTY-NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO DOLLARS AND TWELVE CENTS RESPONDED TAYLOR
BLES SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK
THEN TOO DID NOT BLES PRAISE HER WITH A HAPPY SMILE AS TOGETHER DAY AFTER DAY THEY STOOD AND WATCHED THE BLACK DIRT WHERE THE SILVER FLEECE LAY PLANTED
RACE IS UNDOUBTEDLY DYING OUT
SHE WAS BRILLIANT AND WELL-TRAINED
SHE KNEW THAT EVERY STEP MUST BE THE KEEN PRICKLE OF AWAKENING FLESH
HE IS NO GOD OF MINE
A HARSH LOW MURMURING CROON THAT SHOOK THE VILLAGE RANGED AROUND ITS OLD SQUARE OF DILAPADATED STORES
UNTYING THE STRIPS OF CLOTH HE OPENED HIS BOX AND DISCLOSED CHICKEN AND BISCUITS HAM AND CORN-BREAD
HER SOUND COMMON SENSE RALLIED TO HER AID
HE SEEMED AN ORDINARY RATHER PRIGGISH OPINIONATED COUNTRY BOY AND I WROTE AND SAID--OH I SAID THAT THE WORLD IS THE WORLD
GO AHEAD HE CONCURRED
IF ANY ONE GOES IT MUST BE ME
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL SAID ZORA
SMITH SURPRISED GOT OUT A COPY AND EXPLAINED
SHE WANTED TO BE FREE
FIRST PLACE THE LAND AIN'T YOURS
ZORA SAT THINKING
OUTSIDE THERE WAS MUCH TRAMPLING AND SWEARING
THE OFFICE LOOKED DOWN FROM THE CLOUDS ON LOWER BROADWAY AND WAS SOFT WITH VELVET AND LEATHER
SEE THOSE BOYS OVER THERE
AS COLONEL CRESSWELL COUNTED OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SCHOOL NOTES AND DEPOSITED THEM BESIDE THE MORTGAGE HE SMILED GRIMLY FOR HE SAW THE END
IT WAS MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE AND THREW A STARTLED GLANCE UPWARD TO THE TWISTED BRANCHES OF THE OAK THAT BENT ABOVE SIFTING DOWN SUNSHINE ON HIS BROWN FACE AND CLOSE CURLED HAIR
THEN A DISTANT GUN-SHOT WOKE THE ECHOES
IS--IS ANYTHING THE MATTER SHE ASKED NERVOUSLY
MR CRESSWELL EXPLAINED
WITH ONE OR TWO FURTHER PERFUNCTORY QUESTIONS AND A HASTY EXPRESSION OF THANKS SHE ESCAPED INTO THE AIR
WELL WHY HAS HE NO APPOINTMENT
PERHAPS SHE HAD BEEN INDISCREET IN THUS MAKING A CONFIDANT OF HIM IN HER TROUBLE
ONCE HE FELL HEADLONG BUT WITH A GREAT WRENCH HELD HER FROM HARM AND MINDED NOT THE PAIN THAT SHOT THROUGH HIS RIBS
WITH THAT HAIR IT HAS ARTISTIC POSSIBILITIES
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN SHE SAID GRACIOUSLY
THE DEAD LEATHERED BRONZE OF THE OTHER WAS CARVED IN PITEOUS TERROR
INTERESTED IN DARKIES YOU SEE HE CONCLUDED AND LOOKS TO YOU TO TELL THINGS
COME IS YOU
A LOUD QUICK KNOCK AT THE DOOR--A PAUSE--AN OATH AND A CRY
HE HAD EXPRESSED HIMSELF STRONGLY TO MRS GREY LAST NIGHT AT DINNER AND HAD REINFORCED HIS ARGUMENT BY A POINTED LETTER WRITTEN THIS MORNING
NEVERTHELESS HE NEEDED MRS VANDERPOOL'S INFLUENCE JUST NOW AND HE WAS WILLING TO PAY CONSIDERABLE FOR IT
BUT YOU COULDN'T PLANT IT WITH A SUDDEN SHRILLNESS IT WOULD KILL YOU BUT BLES TRIED TO OBJECT BUT SHE WAVED HIM AWAY
WITH THIS VERDICT THE HOUSE AGREED
IS IT WRONG ASKED ZORA TO MAKE BELIEVE YOU LIKES PEOPLE WHEN YOU DON'T WHEN YOU'SE AFEARED OF THEM AND THINKS THEY MAY RUB OFF AND DIRTY YOU WHY--WHY--YES IF YOU--IF YOU DECEIVE THEN YOU LIES SOMETIMES DON'T YOU MISS TAYLOR STARED HELPLESSLY AT THE SOLEMN EYES THAT SEEMED TO LOOK SO DEEPLY INTO HER
YES ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE PLUNGE DEEPER IN DEBT AND BETRAY OUR FRIENDS WE MAY COME OUT MILLIONAIRES OR--PAUPERS PRECISELY SAID HARRY CRESSWELL CALMLY
WE'SE BOTH CRAZY AIN'T WE SHE RETURNED WITH A SIMPLICITY THAT LEFT THE TEACHER HELPLESS
COLONEL CRESSWELL NEXT DAY STALKED ANGRILY INTO HIS LAWYERS OFFICE
IT MUST BE STOPPED DECLARED CRESSWELL
BUT FROM A SOUTHERNER WHOSE FATHER HAD OWNED FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES--IT WAS INCREDIBLE
I DO WISH SHE COULD ATTEND YOUR BALL SEEING HER BLUNDER SHE PAUSED
BUT SENATOR SMITH BROKE IN TAKING UP AT ONCE THE PARAMOUNT INTEREST
I WAS GOING TO HELL SHE WHISPERED TREMBLING
MANIFESTLY THEN MRS VANDERPOOL'S TASK WAS TO DISCREDIT THE CRESSWELLS WITH THE SOUTHERNERS
STILL EMMA PROBABLY THINKS YOURS IS THE PRIOR CLAIM KNOWING OF COURSE NOTHING OF FACTS
THERE LAY A BOLT OF SILKEN-LIKE CAMBRIC OF WONDROUS FINENESS AND LUSTRE MARKED
SHE TOOK THE PEN AND GLANCED AT MR CRESSWELL
HE DIDN'T DO HIS WORK RIGHT AND HE WHIPPED HIM
COLONEL CRESSWELL IS PRESIDENT OF THE FARMERS LEAGUE
IT IS ALL TOO SHORT FIVE YEARS
IT'S A JEWEL SHE DECIDED
I WAS TEMPTED TO TAKE HER TO THE BOX AT THE OPERA AND LET NEW YORK BREAK ITS IMPUDENT NECK MARY WAS SHOCKED
HE WAS GOING TO RETIRE AND EAT PEANUTS HE SAID WITH A CHUCKLE
LIKE OTHER ANIMALS MARY TAYLOR OPENED HER LIPS TO REBUKE THIS LEVITY WHEN SUDDENLY THE COACHMAN CALLED OUT AND THE HORSES SWERVED AND THE CARRIAGE'S FOUR OCCUPANTS FACED A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN EMBRACING HEARTILY
THEY'VE BEEN VERY MUCH TOGETHER--HIS TAKING HER TO HER CHARGES BRINGING HER BACK AND ALL THAT
IGNORANT LABOR WAS NOT IDEAL BUT IT WAS WORTH TOO MUCH TO EMPLOYERS TO LOSE IT NOW
I UNDERSTAND IT WILL BE UNUSUALLY ELABORATE RETURNED MRS VANDERPOOL A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE TURN
IT WAS SATURDAY AND DARK
AND WHEN SHE TURNED WITH OVERFLOWING HEART TO THANK THE PREACHER HE HAD LEFT THE PLATFORM AND SHE FOUND HIM IN THE YARD WHISPERING DARKLY WITH TWO DEACONS
THERE WAS AN ALLUREMENT ABOUT THIS ALL-PERVASIVE NAME
HAVE YOU A YOUNG MAN NAMED ALWYN ON YOUR ELIGIBLE LIST
THERE WERE OTHER COLORED ORATORS WITH VOICE PRESENCE AND ELOQUENCE
THEY EXCHANGED A FEW POLITE PHRASES FENCING DELICATELY TO TEST THE OTHER'S WRIST AND INTEREST
THEN REINING IN HIS HORSE HE STOPPED IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES AND WATCHED ALWYN
MEANTIME THIS CHILD LABOR BILL IS DIFFERENT
A GANG OF COLORED SECTION HANDS GOT ON DIRTY AND LOUD
IT WAS NO SIN THAT ALWYN HAD DONE
YOU CAN MAKE HER A PERFECT MAID BUT SHE CAN NEVER BE MUCH MORE IN AMERICA SHE IS A PERFECT MAID NOW
SHE DID NOT KNOW MUCH NOW BUT SHE HAD LEARNED HOW TO FIND THINGS OUT
TELL ZORA MISS SMITH AT LAST MANAGED TO SAY
I SEE HE GROANED
WELL IF THERE AIN'T AUNT RACHEL
MR CHARLES SMITH AND JOHN TAYLOR WERE BOTH TOO BUSY TO GO BUT BRONCHIAL TROUBLE INDUCED THE REV
CALL UP THE TREASURY
NOT EVERYTHING OF COURSE BUT A GREAT DEAL
IT ISN'T WORTHY OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE IT WAS MORE THAN INTELLIGENT--IT WAS TRUE ZORA--LISTEN CHILD
I'M HAND IN GLOVE WITH ALWYN
MUST I STUDY FIVE YEARS MRS VANDERPOOL THREW BACK HER HEAD
THE DECISION WE HAVE COME TO IS THIS SAID HARRY CRESSWELL
BUT WHO GAVE IT TO YOU MR STILLINGS WAS THE SOFT REPLY
I FIND BUT ONE FAULT WITH YOU SHE SAID
THE NEWS WOULD REACH THE PAPERS AND BE BLAZONED TO-MORROW
THIS IS WHAT THEY MUST ENDURE--MY POOR PEOPLE AT LYNCHBURG A NEWSBOY BOARDED THE TRAIN WITH HIS WARES
SADLY SOILED YET BEAUTIFUL
ZORA ALMOST FORGETTING THE WEDDING STOOD BEFORE THE MIRROR
THE EARTH STAGGERED BENEATH HIM AS HE STUMBLED ON
TOGETHER THEY COUNTED AND CALCULATED
PERHAPS EVEN ABOUT--BUT HE STOPPED WITH A SIGH AND SAT DOWN IN THE ANTE-ROOM
THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED REPRESENTATIVE TYPES
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE MONOPOLIZE THE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE MANUFACTURE OF COTTON AND USE THE FIRST TO CLUB EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS INTO SUBMISSION EASTERLY STARED AT HIM
S'LONG GOOD-BYE SHE SLOWLY HALF GUILTILY REPLACED THE RECEIVER
THE MUD SPLASHED AND SUNLIGHT GLISTENED
PRETTY BIG HINDRANCES YOU SAY
ALL THE DAY THAT WAS THEIRS THEY WORKED PICKING THE SILVER FLEECE--PICKING IT TENDERLY AND LOVINGLY FROM OFF THE BROWN AND SPENT BODIES WHICH HAD SO UTTERLY YIELDED LIFE AND BEAUTY TO THE FULL FRUITION OF THIS LONG AND SILKEN TENDRIL THIS WHITE BEAUTY OF THE COTTON
SHE KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND ANSWERED THE CALL
YET AS THE SPACE WIDENED BETWEEN THEM EACH FELT A MORE VINDICTIVE ANGER FOR THE OTHER
THEY GLARED IN VAGUE RED AND SHADOWY BRILLIANCE WAVING AND QUIVERING AND THROWING UP THIN SWIRLING COLUMNS OF BLACK SMOKE
JOHNSON WAS WHAT COLONEL CRESSWELL REPEATEDLY CALLED A FAITHFUL NIGGER HE WAS ONE OF THOSE CONSTITUTIONALLY TIMID CREATURES INTO WHOM THE SERVILITY OF HIS FATHERS HAD SUNK SO DEEP THAT IT HAD BECOME SECOND-NATURE
OH HERE A THOUGHT CAME
BLES DID NOT KNOW YET THAT SHE WAS DOWN
HE RAISED HIS HAT
I THINK I MAY SAY YES MR CRESSWELL AGREED
AROUND THEM THE GRAY AND DEATH-LIKE WILDERNESS DARKENED
IT WAS NOT PLEASANT TO GO INTO OPEN COURT AND ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF OVER-REACHED BY A NEGRO
HE MAY HELP US
AUNT RACHEL DID NOT OFFER TO DISPUTE HER DECLARATION
WITH US YONDER THERE IS WRONG BUT WE CALL IT WRONG--MOSTLY
SHE HAD COME PAINFULLY TO REALIZE THAT IF SHE WAS TO HAVE A CAREER SHE MUST MAKE IT FOR HERSELF
ALL DAY THEY HAD BEEN GATHERING STREAMING IN SNAKE-LIKE LINES ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS IN WELL-BRUSHED BRILLIANT ATTIRE HALF FANTASTIC HALF CRUDE
THE GINS WERE STILL ROARING AND SPITTING FLAMES AND SMOKE--FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM IN TOWN AND VALE
NO--FIVE YEARS IS NOT LONG
SHE WAVERED A MOMENT THEN THE ANSWERING LIGHT SPRANG TO HER FACE
THE TOUCH WAS TOO LIGHT THE MEANING TOO ELUSIVE FOR ALWYN TO GRASP ALWAYS THE POINT OF ATTACK
IN BLANK DISMAY ZORA CAME BACK TO HER SENSES
TO-MORROW IS SATURDAY AND I'LL WORK ALL DAY
THEY WHEELED COMFORTABLY DOWN THE ROAD LEAVING THE SOMBRE SWAMP WITH ITS BLACK-GREEN TO THE RIGHT AND HEADING TOWARD THE GOLDEN-GREEN OF WAVING COTTON FIELDS
THEN SLOWLY FROM THE FAR CORNER ROSE A THIN VOICE TREMULOUSLY
BUT BY GRACE OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM I CANNOT AFFORD TO MARRY A MAN--HARK
BLES COULD NOT INFORM HIM BUT STILLINGS COULD AND DID
THIS IS THE BLACK SEA HE SAID POINTING TO THE DULL CABINS THAT CROUCHED HERE AND THERE UPON THE EARTH WITH THE DARK TWINKLING OF THEIR BLACK FOLK DARTING OUT TO SEE THE STRANGERS RIDE BY
DR BOLDISH LOOKED INDIGNANT AND MR BOCOMBE DOVE AFTER HIS NOTE-BOOK
YOU'D BETTER GO NOW
HE'S THE ONLY SOUTHERNER WITH MONEY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE POSITION AND THERE'S BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF QUIET TALK I UNDERSTAND IN SOUTHERN CIRCLES BUT IT'S TREASON EASTERLY SHOUTED
KEEP YOUR--YOUR PHILANDERING TO THE WOODS OR I SHALL HAVE YOU ARRESTED HE SAID SLOWLY HIS FACE COLORLESS HIS LIPS TWITCHING WITH ANGER
AND WHEN WE CAN BE OF REAL SERVICE LET US KNOW
I'D BE GLAD TO DO THE WORK THE CHAIRMAN NEARLY CHOKED
THE ENDOWMENT FAILED AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE--PERHAPS I WAS TOO STUBBORN BUT ZORA'S EYES SNAPPED NO AND MISS SMITH CONTINUED
SHE STARTED TO OPEN THE SUBJECT AGAIN TODAY
SHE TOOK THE RECEIPT CALMLY AND WALKED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS
THE THINGS SHE EXHIBITED REALLY HAD MERIT AND ONE CURIOUSLY ORIGINAL GROUP APPEALED TO MRS VANDERPOOL TREMENDOUSLY
I HAD IT DONE IN EASTERLY'S NEW JERSEY MILLS ACCORDING TO AN OLD PLAN OF MINE
HOW WELL SHE REMEMBERED HER COMING THE FIRST REFLECTION OF YONDER GILDED DOME AND THE SOARING OF THE CAPITOL
BUT MR CRESSWELL WAS STARING AT THE END OF HIS CIGAR
AND BLES KNOWS SHE THINKS OF HIM AND YOU AND I'M CONVINCED IF YOU SAY THE WORD THEY'D LOVE AND MARRY ZORA WALKED SILENTLY WITH HER TO THE DOOR WHERE LOOKING OUT SHE SAW BLES AND EMMA COMING FROM AUNT RACHEL'S
SHE WOULD SHOW HIM THAT THEY HAD NOT FAILED
DEEPER AND DEEPER THEY PENETRATED INTO THE DARK WATERS
WOULD YOU LIKE IT BUT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ALL THESE THINGS RETURNED ZORA SLOWLY
TRUE
THESE ARE FOLKS MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED INDULGENTLY
HE WAS ABOUT TO DON THIS LATTER CLOAK WHEN ZORA APPROACHED WITH A REQUEST BRIEFLY TO ADDRESS THE CONGREGATION
THE RETURN OF ZORA 283 THIRTY-ONE
HE SEEMED TO HAVE SLIPPED AND LOST HIS BEARINGS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS SIMPLE WORLD WERE ROLLING CURIOUSLY ABOUT
MRS GREY SAW THE LIGHT ON THE COLUMNS TOO AS SHE LAY LAZILY IN HER SOFT WHITE BED
BUT HE DID NOT FEEL QUARRELSOME AT THE MOMENT AND THERE WAS AFTER ALL NOTHING VERY TANGIBLE TO JUSTIFY A BERATING
SHE STOOD ON THE ISLAND ETHEREAL SPLENDID LIKE SOME TALL DARK AND GORGEOUS FLOWER OF THE STORIED EAST
SHE STROVE AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THAT GRIPPING TWISTING PAIN--THAT AWFUL HAND--UNTIL THE SHRIEK CAME AND SHE AWOKE
WHO IS HE WE JUST CALL HIM OLD PAPPY--HE'S A PREACHER AND SOME FOLKS SAY A CONJURE MAN TOO AND WHO IS ELSPETH SHE LIVES IN THE SWAMP--SHE'S A KIND OF WITCH I RECKON LIKE--LIKE LIKE MEDEA YES--ONLY--I DON'T KNOW AND HE GREW THOUGHTFUL
BUT I THINK WE CAN HAVE YOUR PROTEGEE LOOK ON FROM THE GALLERY
HE GREW TO IT GRADUALLY INWARDLY REVOLTING FEELING ALWAYS A GREAT LONGING TO TAKE THIS WOMAN AND MAKE HER NESTLE IN HIS ARMS AS SHE USED TO
NEXT DAY HE HAD RETURNED TO THE SUBJECT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND MRS CRESSWELL FORGOT TWO PITFALLS
NO MISS SMITH IS IN THERE NOW
THEY FORMED A PICTURESQUE GROUP
THEY KNEW NOT
WHY BLES WHAT'S THE MATTER CALLED MISS SMITH AS THE HORSE STARTED FORWARD
GRADUALLY TRANSFER MILLS SOUTH EASTERLY ARGUED THAT THE LABOR WAS TOO UNSKILLED IN THE SOUTH AND THAT TO SEND NORTHERN SPINNERS DOWN WOULD SPREAD LABOR TROUBLES
BUT--HE EYED HER AGAIN
MRS CRESSWELL FELT IRRITATED
AND THAT ISN'T ALL CAME SAM STILLINGS UNCTUOUS VOICE
AND YET--YET AFTER THIS,--DON'T YOU SEE?--I CANNOT STAY HERE MRS VANDERPOOL AROSE AND WALKED OVER TO HER
IT WAS A MOST AGREEABLE COUPLE OF HOURS
SHE SAW HERSELF STANDING DIM WITHIN THE SHADOWS DIRECTING THE GROWING POWER OF A MAN
THE HOURS PASSED
I SUSPECTED THAT SHE WAS--NOT WHAT SHE OUGHT TO BE
THE COLONEL SAUNTERED OUT AND FOUND BLES ALWYN WAITING
SLOWLY AND WARILY THEY THREADED THEIR WAY
COULD I WAIT IN THE BACK HALL MARY STARTED TO HAVE HIM WAIT IN THE FRONT HALL BUT SHE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND HAD HIM SHOWN BACK
LOOK YONDER HE POINTED ACROSS THE SQUARE TO THE COURT-HOUSE
TWENTY-SIX CONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL THE ELECTION OF HARRY CRESSWELL TO CONGRESS WAS A VERY SIMPLE MATTER
MRS VANDERPOOL DID NOT READILY GIVE UP HER PLEA FOR ALWYN AND BADE ZORA GET MR SMITH ON THE TELEPHONE FOR DISCUSSION
USE THIS IN YOUR WORK SHE SAID
SHE WAS SINCERELY PLEASED AT SEEING HIM
IT'LL BRING MY SEAT TOO NEAR THE EARTH HE LOOKED UP
IN HER BRAIN DANCED ALL THE DREAMS AND VISIONS OF CHILDHOOD
IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE ORIGINAL CAUSE OF HER WHOLE LIFE PUNISHMENT LAY IN HER PERSISTENT MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE BLACK PEOPLE AND THEIR PROBLEM
HE FROWNED AS HE NOTED THE FOOTPRINTS POINTING TO ELSPETH'S--WHAT DID MARY TAYLOR WANT THERE
THE HOT DUSTY QUADRANGLE STRETCHED IN DREARY DEADNESS TOWARD THE TEMPLE OF THE TOWN AS IF DOING OBEISANCE TO THE COURT-HOUSE
THEY OWE ME A LOT OF MONEY SAID THE COLONEL
EVERY COLOR WAS HERE
UNDER THE OLD POLITICAL REGIME IT HAD BEEN AN EASY MATTER TO AVOID SERIOUS DAMAGE-SUITS FOR THE ACCIDENTS IN THE MILL
SHE DOES NOT REALIZE WHAT USE THEY ARE MAKING OF HER PASSING INTEREST HE HURRIED AWAY AND SENATOR SMITH FELT A BIT SORRY FOR MRS CRESSWELL WHEN HE RECALLED THE EXPRESSION ON HER HUSBAND'S FACE
HE DON'T KNOW MUCH LAW I'M AFRAID
SHE'S AS WHITE AS THE LILY BLES
THEY FLIES AND CREEPS AND CRAWLS SLIPPERY-LIKE
IF YOU OBJECT TO MEETING THE COLORED PEOPLE MRS CRESSWELL BLUSHED
HE THOUGHT OF ZORA AGAIN
THERE WAS WATSON MISS WYNN DID NOT PAUSE
ALL RIGHT UNCLE JIM HE SAID
NOR DID THE ANCIENT WITCH BY WORD OR LOOK AGAIN GIVE THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
UP THE ROAD TO THE EASTWARD THAT RAN PAST THE SCHOOL WITH THE MORNING SUN AT HIS BACK STRODE A YOUNG MAN YELLOW CRISP-HAIRED STRONG-FACED WITH DARKLY KNIT BROWS
THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO MAKE A DEPOSIT HERE AND GET THINGS WHEN YOU WANT THEM
HER HANDS DROPPED SHE STOOD VERY STILL WITH DRAWN FACE GRAYISH-BROWN BOTH HANDS UNCONSCIOUSLY OUT-STRETCHED AND THE COTTON SWAYING WHILE DEEP DOWN IN HER EYES DIMLY SLOWLY A HORROR LIT AND GREW
MR CALDWELL TOLD COLONEL CRESSWELL THAT HE CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TWELVE-CENT COTTON
EDUCATING OR RATHER TRYING TO EDUCATE NIGGERS WILL MAKE THEM RESTLESS AND DISCONTENTED--THAT IS SCARCE AND DEAR AS WORKERS
THIRTY-SIX THE LAND COLONEL CRESSWELL STARTED ALL THE MORE GRIMLY TO OVERTHROW THE NEW WORK AT THE SCHOOL BECAUSE SOMEWHERE DOWN BENEATH HIS HEART A PITY AND A WONDER WERE STIRRING
ELSPETH STOOD IN THE PATH THAT WOUND DOWN TO THE COTTAGE AND WITHOUT A WORD ZORA DROPPED THE BASKET AT HER FEET
COLD AND DREAMLIKE WITHOUT HER SHUT TEETH HELD BACK SEETHING FIRES WITHIN AND A SPIRIT OF REVOLT THAT GATHERED WILDNESS AS IT GREW
IT WAS A SIMPLE BUT PLEASANT AUDITORIUM NEARLY FILLED WITH WELL-DRESSED PEOPLE
OF COURSE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE HOVERING DOUBT AS TO WHETHER HE REALLY WANTED HER OR NOT
EITHER BRIDEGROOM LOOKED GLADLY AT THE FLOW OF HIS SISTER'S GARMENTS AND ALMOST DARKLY AT HIS BRIDE'S
THE SPEECH WAS A SOFTENED ENGLISH PURELY AND ON THE WHOLE CORRECTLY SPOKEN--SO MUCH SO THAT IT SEEMED AT FIRST ALMOST UNFAMILIAR TO BLES AND HE EXPERIENCED AGAIN THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF BEING AMONG STRANGERS
IT--IT WOULD BE DECIDEDLY THE PROPER THING HE MURMURED AND WE COULD OF COURSE INVITE MISS SHE SAW THE DIFFICULTY AND INTERRUPTED HIM
I KNOW THE LAW AND MOST OF THE DECISIONS
MRS VANDERPOOL I NEED YOUR AID MRS VANDERPOOL SMILED POLITELY AND MURMURED SOMETHING
THEY ENTERED THE BALCONY AND SAT DOWN
FIRST HER BROTHER ATTACKED HER NOT SIMPLY ON COTTON BUT TO HER GREAT SURPRISE ON NEGRO EDUCATION
HASTILY WIPING HER EYES AUNT RACHEL ROSE
YES MY DEAR SAID MR MAXWELL WHOSE LANDS LAY NEXT TO THE CRESSWELLS ON THE NORTHWEST YES IF COTTON GOES TO TWELVE OR THIRTEEN CENTS AS SEEMS PROBABLE I THINK WE CAN BEGIN THE NEW HOUSE"--FOR MRS MAXWELL'S CHERISHED DREAM WAS A PILLARED MANSION LIKE THE CRESSWELLS MR TOLLIVER LOOKED AT HIS HOUSE AND BARNS
SHE HAD BOUGHT JANE ADDAMS NEWER IDEALS OF PEACE AND HE HAD YAWNED OVER IT UNDISGUISEDLY
SLOWLY AGAIN SHE DRIFTED TOWARD UNCONSCIOUSNESS
THE SONG PROCEEDED WITH LESS ASSURANCE SLOWER AND LOWER TILL IT STOPPED AND THE SINGER DROPPED TO THE GROUND WATCHING HIM WITH WIDE EYES
SLOWLY THE HOPELESSNESS AND BITTERNESS OF IT ALL CAME BACK IN A GREAT WHELMING FLOOD
THERE WAS NO NEED TO THINK THE THING OVER--SHE HAD THOUGHT IT OVER--AND SHE LOOKED INTO MRS GREY'S EYES AND WITH GATHERING TEARS IN HER OWN SAID
IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF--BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
ALWYN HAS BEEN WORKING LIKE A BEAVER FOR THE NATIONAL EDUCATION BILL
HIS ARM SHOT OUT AND HE POINTED STRAIGHT AT ZORA
THE COTTON FOR WHICH THEY HAD MADE DEBTS WAS STILL FALLING IN VALUE
IT WOULD MAKE A PRETTY MORNING-DRESS BUT HELEN HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN DISLIKE TO THE THOUGHT OF IT
DID JOHN THINK SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO
OPEN THIS DOOR DAMN YOU A MOMENT OF WAITING AND THEN THE KNOCKING CAME AGAIN FURIOUS AND LONG CONTINUED
TODD ASKS
MR CRESSWELL EXPECTS FRIENDS TO DINNER WHAT A MAGNIFICENT INTELLIGENCE OFFICE REMARKED MR BOCOMBE FOR FURNISHING SERVANTS TO THE NATION
SHE REMEMBERED MISS SMITH'S WARNING OF YEARS BEFORE--AND HE HAD BEEN NORTH SINCE AND ACQUIRED NORTHERN NOTIONS OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY
I'D MAKE A POOR BEGGAR
SHE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER COMING TO THIS HOUSE
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN MY HAIR-DRESSER'S FACE WHEN I TOLD HER TO DO IT UP
NONSENSE HE SPURNED THE SUGGESTION
SHE HAS GONE BACK NOW"--BACK TO THE SUN AND THE SWAMP BACK TO THE BURDEN
IT'S A DAMNED LIE HE SHOUTED TO THE TREES
THE OLD HORSE JOGGED LAZILY ON AND BLES SWITCHED HIM UNAVAILINGLY
CRESSWELL MIGHT GAMBLE AND DRINK AND LIE LIKE A GENTLEMAN BUT HE WOULD NEVER WILLINGLY CHEAT OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A WHITE MAN'S FINANCIAL NECESSITIES
I SPITS ON THE WORLD
ZORA BENEATH HER APPARENT FRANKNESS WAS IMPENETRABLE AND HE FELT THAT SHE CAREFULLY AVOIDED HIM ALTHOUGH SHE DID IT SO DEFTLY THAT HE FELT RATHER THAN OBSERVED IT
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE DINNER FOR YOU SAID MISS WYNN FINALLY AND ALWYN GREW HOT WITH PLEASURE
OF COURSE MRS VANDERPOOL I SEE HOW IT IS
THEN LEAVING THE CABIN ON HER RIGHT AND THE SCENE OF THEIR TOIL ON HER LEFT SHE CUT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE SWAMP SKIRTED THE BIG ROAD AND IN A HALF-HOUR WAS IN THE LOWER MEADOWS OF THE CRESSWELL PLANTATIONS WHERE THE TIRED STOCK WAS BEING TURNED OUT TO GRAZE FOR THE NIGHT
HOUR AFTER HOUR DAY AFTER DAY SHE LAY BURIED DEAF AND DUMB TO ALL ELSE
FOLLOW THEM AND AT NOON COME TO THE OFFICE--WAIT
THIS WAS THE THOUGHT THAT AWAKENED HARRY CRESSWELL TO A SENSE OF ENDLESS WELL-BEING
THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ANSWERED SLOWLY
WHY IT'S A THRONE HE LAUGHED
HE'S A DAMNED SCOUNDREL
TRULY HER CHEEKS WERE GLOWING AND HER EYES BRIGHT BUT HE DISAPPROVED
PRAY FOR THE CORN YOU STOLE THURSDAY THE BLACK FIGURE MOVED
AND I SAY FRANKLY YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT NOW IF WE WEREN'T CONVINCED YOU WERE TOO FAR INVOLVED AND THE LEAGUE TOO DISCOURAGED TO REPEAT THE DOSE NOW LOOK HERE SIR BEGAN COLONEL CRESSWELL FLUSHING AND DRAWING HIMSELF ERECT
THE WHOLE CROWD WAS NOT THERE YET--PERHAPS YOU KIN SAY JUST A WORD BEFORE THE SERMONT HE FINALLY YIELDED
THEY SHALL CONFIRM HIM SHE WHISPERED IF I HAVE TO MORTGAGE MY IMMORTAL SOUL AND SHE RANG UP LONG DISTANCE ON THE TELEPHONE
IT WAS NO TUNE NOR MELODY IT WAS JUST FORMLESS BOUNDLESS MUSIC
SHE TALKED INTERESTINGLY AND LISTENED SYMPATHETICALLY TO HIM
THERE WAS AMONG MANY OTHERS A LETTER FROM SENATOR SMITH
IT WAS NEITHER THE BEAUTIFULLY MISCHIEVOUS FACE OF THE GIRL NOR THE PAIN-STRICKEN FACE OF THE WOMAN
HE FEARED NOT
THEY IS ALL LITTLE FUNNY DARK PEOPLE
I'VE GAMBLED--FOR MONEY--AND--WOMEN--BUT BUT NOT ON COTTON HEY
ALWAYS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN VEILED FROM THESE FOLK
HIS MENTAL ATTITUDE TOWARD ZORA HAD ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF GUIDANCE GUARDIANSHIP AND INSTRUCTION
ZORA SHE FALTERED WILL YOU LEAVE ME ZORA ANSWERED YES IT WAS A SOFT YES A YES FULL OF PITY AND REGRET BUT A YES THAT MRS VANDERPOOL KNEW IN HER SOUL TO BE FINAL
THERE WAS A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST A CRY AND A WILD SCRAMBLE AS THE WHITE AND ANGRY FACES OF MEN AND BOYS GLEAMED A MOMENT AND FADED
DON'T BE SARCASTIC I HEARD YOU
THIS CONDITION WAS PATENTLY THE RESULT OF THE COTTON CORNER AND THE SUBSEQUENT MANIPULATION
SHE HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING
I SAY WHITE BUT THEY'LL RULE US--OUT-VOTE US--MARRY OUR DAUGHTERS WARMLY OBJECTED THE COLONEL
THAT LEAVES YOU TWENTY-FIVE IN OUR DEBT
ALL THE WHILE THE GREATER QUESTIONS WERE BEATING AND CURLING AND BUILDING THEMSELVES BACK IN HER BRAIN AND ABOVE ALL SHE WAS WONDERING WHY NO ONE HAD TOLD HER BEFORE OF ALL THIS MIGHTY WORLD
SHE WAS IN MANY RESPECTS AN INEXPERIENCED GIRL
WELL WAIT A MOMENT
IN THEIR MIDST WIDE-EYED AND LAUGHING ALMOST HYSTERICALLY MARCHED ZORA
MR EASTERLY CALLS THIS AFTERNOON
BUT THE DAY WAS BALMY THE WAY WAS BEAUTIFUL
SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE SENATE HAD REJECTED ALWYN'S NOMINATION
HE GRASPED HIS HOE AND STARTED BRISKLY TO WORK
JOHN TAYLOR LEFT THE CONFERENCE BLITHELY
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THE MULE AGAIN SWAM THE SLIMY LAGOON AND DISAPPEARED TOWARD THE CRESSWELL FIELDS
I DON'T THINK I QUITE GRASP ALL THIS HE SAID AS HE SHOOK HANDS
I GUESS WE'LL WORRY ALONG WITH HER A LITTLE WHILE ANYHOW SHE SAID
ZORA MOTHERED HER MISS SMITH FOUND HER PLENTY TO DO AND BLES THOUGHT HER A GOOD GIRL
WHICH BEING INTERPRETED WHISPERED MISS WYNN MEANS THAT BRYN MAWR DRAWS THE COLOR LINE WHILE WE AT TIMES SURMOUNT IT THEY MOVED ON TO ANOTHER GROUP
ALL THESE SHE PLACED SADLY AND GENTLY INTO THE DEAD PAST
HE WAS CORRECTLY DRESSED AND THE WHITE SHIRT SET OFF THE COMELINESS OF HIS BLACK FACE IN COMPELLING CONTRAST
MAY I VENTURE TO ASK A FAVOR OF YOU CERTAINLY HE RESPONDED
SO HUMAN MARY TAYLOR ROSE UP STIFFLY AND MUMBLED A BRIEF GOOD-NIGHT
SHE WAS THIRSTY WITH THE WALK
DAZZLED HE CREPT FORWARD BEWILDERED FASCINATED UNTIL WITH ONE LAST WILD WHIRL THE ELF-GIRL PAUSED
HER EYES WENT DREAMING
THE FAT PREACHER COWERED GRAY AND TREMBLING
SHE LIKED HIM FRANKLY UNDISGUISEDLY
AND OVER YONDER BEHIND THE SWAMPS IS GREAT FIELDS FULL OF DREAMS PILED HIGH AND BURNING
SO IT WAS THAT THE BEWILDERED BLACK SERF DAWDLED IN LISTLESS INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND
SHE TOOK THE BOOK AND WITH A NOD WAS GONE
SHE WAS RETURNING FROM WITNESSING THE MARDI GRAS FESTIVITIES AT NEW ORLEANS AND AT THE URGENT INVITATION OF THE CRESSWELLS HAD STOPPED OFF
SHE HAD HEARD WITH UNEASINESS OF CRESSWELL'S RENEWED CANDIDACY FOR THE PARIS AMBASSADORSHIP AND SHE SET HERSELF TO BLOCK IT
YOU KNOW IT'S MORTGAGED AND MISS SMITH HAS HAD TO USE THE MORTGAGE MONEY FOR YEARLY EXPENSES THE COLONEL SMILED GRIMLY
HE DID NOT HOLD HER HE DID NOT OFFER THE FAREWELL KISS BUT STOOD STARING AT THE ROAD AS SHE WALKED INTO THE SWAMP
IN VAIN HER SHREWD NEW ENGLAND REASON ASKED
HERE SHE WAS DOING SOME WORK TWICE AS WELL AND TWICE AS FAST AS THE CLASS AND OTHER WORK SHE WOULD NOT TOUCH BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT HER CLASSIFICATION IN SCHOOL WAS NEARLY AS DIFFICULT AS HER CLASSIFICATION IN THE WORLD AND MISS TAYLOR REACHED UP IMPATIENTLY AND REMOVED THE GOLD PIN FROM HER STOCK TO ADJUST IT MORE COMFORTABLY WHEN ZORA SAUNTERED PAST UNSEEING UNHEEDING WITH THAT CURIOUS GLIDING WALK WHICH MISS TAYLOR CALLED STEALTHY
TO HIS SURPRISE THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY
IT IS TOO LOW
SILENCE FELL DEEP AND SOFT
BEYOND THE COTTON WAREHOUSE SMOKED THE CHIMNEYS OF THE SEED-MILL AND THE COTTON-GIN
WILL YOU EAT WITH ME YES SHE SAID AND WATCHED HIM WITH EAGER EYES
YOU SEE CONTINUED MISS SMITH JUST AS SOON AS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSPECTIVE ENDOWMENT WAS SENT BROADCAST BY THE PRESS THE DONATIONS FROM THE NORTH FELL OFF
WHY WERE HER EYES WET TODAY AND HER MIND ON THE SILVER FLEECE
TWO GREAT STORM-SWEPT EYES LOOKED INTO HIS OUT OF A WORLD OF INFINITE PAIN AND HE DROPPED HIS HEAD IN HESITATION AND SHAME AND KISSED HER HAND
SO DID I ZORA GLANCED AT HER QUICKLY
THAT OLD NIGGER JIM SYKES OVER ON THE LOWER PLACE SIR AIN'T SHOWED UP AGAIN THIS MORNING CRESSWELL NODDED
THIS WAS SACRIFICE
THE GIRL WAS ALL AT ONCE TRANSFIGURED--ANIMATED GLOWING LOVELY
DAT'S WHY I COME OVER HERE TO TALK WID YOU WHERE IS THE DEED HE HANDED IT TO HER AND HER HEART SANK
LET'S GO OVER MATTERS CAREFULLY SHE PROPOSED
YES SIR WHAT DO YOU DO I TEACH AND NURSE AT THE SCHOOL GOOD
THERE WAS NO TIME IN SHORT
THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN GREW TO LOVE THIS BUSY THOUGHTFUL WOMAN AND ZORA'S FEARS WERE QUIETED
IT WAS NOT THE COMING OF THE THOUGHTLESS CARELESS GIRL OF FIVE YEARS AGO WHO HAD MARCHED A DOZEN TIMES UNTHINKING BEFORE THE FACES OF WHITE MEN
SHE HAD EXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS OF COURSE
STILLINGS ROSE AND DEPARTED
BUT THEY DID NOT AGREE ALWAYS AS TO THE THINGS THEMSELVES
SOME OF THE LISTENERS WONDERED
THEN FIGURE WHAT IT MIGHT DO IN THE HANDS OF--LET US SAY FRIENDS WHO'S RUNNING IT A COLONEL CRESSWELL IS ITS HEAD AND HAPPENS ALSO TO BE THE FORCE BEHIND IT
WHY HE SAID AT LENGTH AREN'T YOU PROMOTING IT NO WAS THE REPLY
HE ADMIRED THE DASHING AND HANDSOME MISS EASTERLY BUT SHE SCARED HIM AND MADE HIM ANGRILY AWKWARD
THE DARK WOODWORK OF THE OLD ENGLISH WAINSCOTING GLOWED WITH THE CRIMSON FLAMING OF LOGS IN THE WIDE FIREPLACE
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH SUDDENLY THE WORLD WAS STAGGERING AND FALTERING ABOUT HIM
BUT SHE WANTS NOT ONLY HER HUSBAND'S APPOINTMENT BUT THIS DARKEY'S TOO BUT THAT'S BEEN DECIDED HASN'T IT PUT IN SMITH
WELL WELL HE SAID HIS AIR HALF PREOCCUPIED HALF UNCONCERNED I SUPPOSE SO--AND YET"--HE READ THE LETTER AGAIN ALOUD
DRESSES HUNG STRAIGHTER
WELL SIR I'VE COME TO SCHOOL HUMPH--WE CAN'T TEACH BOYS FOR NOTHING THE BOY STRAIGHTENED
SLOWLY QUIETLY HIS HAND MOVED BACK UNTIL IT GRASPED THE HILT OF THE BIG COLT'S REVOLVER THAT WAS EVER WITH HIM--HIS THIN WHITE HAND BECAME SUDDENLY STEADY AS IT SLIPPED THE WEAPON BENEATH THE SHADOW OF THE DESK
SAM GLANCED AT HIM
I WANT MR COLE
SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO SPEND THE SUMMER WITH MRS GREY AT LAKE GEORGE AND SUCH A SUMMER!--SILKEN CLOTHES AND DAINTY FOOD MOTORING AND GOLF WELL-GROOMED MEN AND ELEGANT WOMEN
THE PROMINENT NEGROES WERE CAREFULLY CATALOGUED WRITTEN TO AND PUT UNDER PERSONAL INFLUENCE
WON'T YOU JOIN ME THE INVITATION IS TEMPTING SHE HESITATED
THEN LIFTING THE HAT WHICH HE HAD NEGLECTED TO REMOVE IN CROSSING THE HALL HE BOWED IN STATELY GRACE
SHE FELT AT ONCE A DESPERATE DESIRE TO KNOW THIS GIRL BETTER AND TO ESTABLISH HER OWN AUTHORITY
THE TUMULT AND WAR WITHIN HER FLED AND A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS SENT THE HOT TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER CHEEKS
ALREADY LUSTFUL EYES WERE IN WAIT AND THE CHILD WAS TOO IGNORANT TO PROTECT HERSELF
FROM LONG LINES OF HUNGRY MEN FROM PATIENT SAD-EYED WOMEN FROM OLD FOLK AND CREEPING CHILDREN WENT UP THE CRY CLOTHES CLOTHES FAR AWAY THE WIDE BLACK LAND THAT BELTS THE SOUTH WHERE MISS SMITH WORKED AND MISS TAYLOR DRUDGED AND BLES AND ZORA DREAMED THE DENSE BLACK LAND SENSED THE CRY AND HEARD THE BOUND OF ANSWERING LIFE WITHIN THE VAST DARK BREAST
THERE STANDING STRAIGHT AND TALL HE GLARED DOWN UPON HER
WITH STARTLED EYES SHE CAUGHT THE IMPUDENT HEADLINES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED MRS CRESSWELL AND THEN IN A MOMENT IT FLASHED UPON HER
DON'T YOU SEE YOU'RE PLANNING TO CUT OFF YOUR NOSES
THE DRESSMAKER TOO WAS WREATHED IN SMILES
THE PURPLE OF ITS FLOWERS MINGLED WITH THE SILVER RADIANCE OF TENDRILS THAT TREMBLED ACROSS THE HURRYING THRONG LIKE THREADS OF MISTS ALONG LOW HILLS
ONE CONDITION IS THAT MY FRIEND MR CRESSWELL HERE AND THESE OTHER GENTLEMEN INCLUDING SOUND NORTHERN BUSINESS MEN LIKE MR EASTERLY SHALL HOLD THIS MONEY IN TRUST AND EXPEND IT FOR YOUR SCHOOL AS THEY THINK BEST MR CRESSWELL WOULD BE THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE ASKED MISS SMITH SLOWLY WITH WHITE FACE
SHE NOTED EVERYTHING FROM THE INFINITELY TWISTED CRACKLED DEAD AND GRAYISH-BLACK TO THE PILED MASS OF RED GOLDEN SUNLIGHT
YET SHE MUST GO ON NATURALLY AND EASILY BOLDLY BUT CIRCUMSPECTLY AND PLAY A DARING GAME WITH TWO POWERFUL MEN
DONE CRIED TAYLOR
THE YOUNG MAN SAT IN A CORNER DREAMING
IS YOU AFEARED HONEY SHE WHISPERED
NOW A RIDE OF AN EARLY SPRING MORNING IN ALABAMA OVER A LEISURELY OLD PLANTATION ROAD AND BEHIND A SPIRITED HORSE IS AN EVENT TO BE ENJOYED
NO ZORA QUIETLY ANSWERED NOT QUITE BUT TOMORROW MORNING EARLY AS SOON AS SHE WAS ALONE AGAIN SHE SAT DOWN AND CONSIDERED
I'LL ATONE
MARY TAYLOR REGARDED HER IN PERPLEXED DESPAIR
BUT IN AWFUL EARNESTNESS SHE TURNED TOWARD THE FUTURE
THEY WANT TO KEEP NIGGERS DOWN I DON'T BELIEVE IT
AS MR SMITH DREW NEAR MRS GREY'S MURRAY HILL RESIDENCE HIS FACE HAD MELTED TO A CYNICAL SMILE
HER DARK EYES SHONE BLUE
IF YOU HAD WANTED A PIN AND ASKED ME I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU THE GIRL BLAZED
SHE HAD BEEN SO USED TO LECTURING THE OLDER WOMAN THAT THE SUDDEN SUMMONING OF HER WELL KNOWN STERNNESS AGAINST HERSELF TOOK HER BREATH AND SHE SAT AWKWARDLY LIKE THE SCHOOL GIRL THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR MISS SMITH TO SPEAK
THE WORLD MUST STAND IN WONDER BEFORE THIS CLEVER WOMAN SINKING HER SOUL IN ANOTHER AND RAISING HIM BY SHEER WILL TO THE HIGHEST
THEN MISS TAYLOR BRACED HERSELF MENTALLY AND TOOK THE WAR INTO AFRICA
HIRED ASKED SOME ONE
INDEED IN ALL THINGS HE WAS IN HER EYES A GENTLEMAN IN THE FINE OLD-FASHIONED ARISTOCRACY OF THE TERM
IT'S ONE OF DUNN'S BOYS SAID BLES
A PRETTY TOUGH PROPOSITION FOR CLEARING AND PLOUGHING SAID BLES WITH PRACTISED EYE
YOU SEE IT'S BARELY POSSIBLE FOR INSTANCE THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN THE FRENCH AMBASSADORSHIP
LARGER AND LARGER ONES WERE PROJECTED AND MORE AND MORE ALWYN WAS PUSHED TO THE FRONT
THOUGHT MISS TAYLOR
AND HE TO HER WAS ALWAYS TWO MEN
I GUESS I COULD GET OFF
HERE YOU!--LOAFING AGAIN DAMN YOU SHE SAW THE BLACK WHIP WRITHE AND CURL ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF THE PLOUGH-BOY
OUR?--WAS OUR RIGHT
THE VERY SLIGHTS AND HUMILIATIONS OF PREJUDICE HE TURNED TO HIS ADVANTAGE
WE RAISE CONSIDERABLE COTTON BUT NOT NEARLY WHAT WE OUGHT TO
MY IDEA IS THAT THIS SCHOOL SHOULD FURNISH MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN WORK AND EARN AN HONEST LIVING TRAIN UP FAMILIES ARIGHT AND PERFORM THEIR DUTIES AS FATHERS MOTHERS AND CITIZENS YES--YES PRECISELY SAID MRS GREY THAT'S WHAT I MEANT I THINK THE WHITES CAN ATTEND TO THE DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP WITHOUT HELP OBSERVED MR CRESSWELL
ALWYN WAS VISIBLY GRATEFUL AS WELL AS SURPRISED
SHE SAW LITTLE OF ZORA PERSONALLY BUT SHE SAW HER GIRLS AND LEARNED MUCH OF HER PLANS
AND YET TO BE A MAN
THEREFORE ARE READY TO PIT YOURSELF AGAINST THE ORGANIZED PLANTATION SYSTEM WITHOUT CAPITAL OR EXPERIENCE
YES THE NAME OF CONGRESSMAN PETER SMITH WAS QUITE FAMILIAR
BUT IT'S PRETTIEST WHEN THE BOLLS COME AND SWELL AND BURST AND THE COTTON COVERS THE FIELD LIKE FOAM ALL MISTY SHE BENT WONDERING OVER THE PALE PLANTS
A BIT DOUBTFUL AND UNCERTAIN
A SOB STRUGGLED IN HIS THROAT
GAZED STRAIGHT INTO THE VERY EYES OF HIS DREAMING
NO ONE WOULD WONDER AT HER BEING THERE
I'M GOING TO HAVE A FEW FRIENDS IN NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT
ENOUGH TO MARRY ME SHE ANSWERED VERY CALMLY AND CERTAINLY
IN TOWN RUMOR SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE
SOMEHOW ZORA SEEMED TOO UNUSUAL AND STRANGE FOR HIM--TOO INHUMAN AS MARY CRESSWELL JUDGED HUMANITY
WE CONTROL THE GREY MILLIONS
MR CRESSWELL STRUCK HIS MARE A VICIOUS BLOW AND DASHED TOWARD TOWN
THE OLD CRONE THREW AN EPITHET AFTER HER
SHE REMEMBERED HAVING HEARD ABOUT IT
AND YET AS SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE DARK FACE HOT WITH ENTHUSIASM IT ALL SEEMED SOMEHOW MORE THAN RIGHT
AND YET HE WAS SO KIND AND GOOD AND WHEN HE CAME IN AT EVENING HE BENT SO GALLANTLY FOR HIS KISS AND LAID FRESH FLOWERS BEFORE HER
SHE HAD DROPPED THE IMPISH MISCHIEF OF HER WAY AND UP FROM BENEATH IT ROSE A WISTFUL VISIONARY TENDERNESS
THE GIRL WAS LATER THAN USUAL AND SHE WAS MOMENTARILY EXPECTING TO SEE HER TALL FORM MOVING LANGUIDLY UP THE WALK
JUST THEN TOO ZORA CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM AND FOR A MOMENT HESITATED THEN CAME ON
IN THOSE DAYS FOR THESE TWO SOULS EARTH CAME VERY NEAR TO HEAVEN
I--ER--CAME
TODAY AS SHE CAME BACK SHE BROUGHT NEWS THAT COLONEL CRESSWELL WHO HAD BEEN UNWELL FOR SEVERAL DAYS WAS WORSE
SHE SAW WITH A SWELLING OF PITY THE DRAWN AND STRICKEN FACE OF HER OLD FRIEND AND SHE STARTED UP
TWO WHITE MEN CAME RIDING BY
IS THERE A PERSON NAMED CAROLINE WYNN LIVING IN THIS HOUSE THE GIRL SMILED AND HESITATED
ONCE UNDER OBLIGATION TO HIM HER SERVICES WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE
ZORA HELPED HIM UNTIL HE CAME TO THE BLACK OAK AT THE WESTERN EDGE
I KNOW WHO'S BACK OF THIS--IT'S THAT NIGGER WE SAW TALKING TO THE WHITE WOMAN IN THE FIELD THE OTHER DAY WELL DON'T WORK YOURSELF UP
PERHAPS I MIGHT GO NORTH AND--BEG SHE SHIVERED
IT WAS FULL OF HER PEOPLE AND SHE WAS VERY VERY LONELY
IT IS A GRAVE CONTINUED THE SENATOR OF AMBITIONS AND IDEALS
THEY OR RATHER MR VANDERPOOL'S CONNECTIONS WERE OF OLD DUTCH NEW YORK STOCK
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GRIN AND BEAR IT A WHILE BUT GET BACK AT THE DARKIES WHENEVER YOU CAN
IT WORKED A RAPID TRANSFORMATION IN THE SERVANT'S MANNER WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE HER
WHAT SHALL I TELL MISS SMITH
THE CHILDREN SANG MERRILY IN THE BROWN-WHITE FIELD
I'VE DONE WHAT I COULD
WHETHER OR NOT CAROLINE WYNN WOULD EVERY MARRY HIM WAS A PERENNIAL SUBJECT OF SPECULATION AMONG THEIR FRIENDS AND IT USUALLY ENDED IN THE VERDICT THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD IT--THAT IT WAS FINANCIALLY IMPOSSIBLE
SHE DID NOT KNOW BUT SOMETHING TO STILL THIS WAR IN HER BOSOM
I'M NOT SAYING HE WILL FATHER
WE CAN BUY THESE NEGROES OFF WITH A LITTLE MONEY AND A FEW SMALL OFFICES
HE AROSE AT TEN DINED AT SEVEN AND WENT TO BED BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE
BLES SHE BEGAN DIDACTICALLY WHERE ARE YOU FROM HE GLANCED ACROSS AT HER AND ANSWERED SHORTLY
TEERSWELL HE WHISPERED YOU KNOW I WAS WORKING TO BE REGISTER OF THE TREASURY
THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH EVEN THEN THE LINE WOULD BE DRAWN SOMEHOW
FOR HIS SISTER TAYLOR HAD A FEELING OF SUPERIORITY THAT WAS ALMOST CONTEMPT
THEN HE LEFT HER FOR IT WAS ALREADY FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON AND HE SPOKE AT EIGHT
SHE WALKED TO TOWN TO THE STATION
AIN'T YOU GOT NO MONEY HE ASKED
BUT DID HE DESIRE HER AS A WIFE
THEY JUST GOT THINGS--HEAVY DEAD THINGS
IT MATTERS NOW HOW STRAIT THE GATE HOW CHARGED WITH PUNISHMENT THE SCROLL
ATONEMENT 371 THE QUEST OF THE SILVER FLEECE TO ONE WHOSE NAME MAY NOT BE WRITTEN BUT TO WHOSE TIRELESS FAITH THE SHAPING OF THESE CRUDER THOUGHTS TO FORMS MORE FITLY PERFECT IS DOUBTLESS DUE THIS FINISHED WORK IS HEREWITH DEDICATED NOTE HE WHO WOULD TELL A TALE MUST LOOK TOWARD THREE IDEALS
GOOD-MORNING SHE SAID WITH A SOFT DRAWL
THE TOIL WAS BEYOND EXHILARATION--IT WAS SICKENING WEARINESS AND PANTING DESPAIR
I USED TO THINK A LIE A LITTLE THING A CONVENIENCE
THEN HIS MIND FLEW OFF AGAIN
DO YOU KNOW ME THE GIRL SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM
I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE HEARD EVIL RUMORS
ONE MATTER INDEED DID WORRY HER
MRS CRESSWELL'S PERPLEXITY INCREASED
HE MUST KNOW MORE ABOUT THE GIRL
WHY NOT TAKE THIS YOUNG MAN IN HAND AND MAKE A NEGRO LEADER OF HIM--A PROTAGONIST OF TEN MILLIONS
IT WAS HUMAN MUSIC BUT OF A WILDNESS AND A WEIRDNESS THAT STARTLED THE BOY AS IT FLUTTERED AND DANCED ACROSS THE DULL RED WATERS OF THE SWAMP
SHE HEARD THE SOFT RAISING OF A WINDOW AND THE CLOSING OF A DOOR
I'M AN OLD WOMAN AND I'VE SEEN MANY THINGS
TO THEM THIS PECULIAR SPECTACLE OF THE MARKET PLACE WAS OF UNUSUAL INTEREST
IS THE CONGRESSIONAL BUSINESS VERY HEAVY HE LAUGHED SO HILARIOUSLY THAT SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WHICH HE OBSERVED
SHE STAGGERED TOWARD THE WOMAN'S OUTSTRETCHED ARMS
MR CALDWELL HIMSELF HURRIED FORWARD
THE REST IS GATHERED FROM THE CRUMBS OF DIVES TABLE THEN HE SAW THE TWINKLE IN HER EYES
NO BLES THIRTY-FIVE THE COTTON MILL THE PEOPLE OF TOOMSVILLE STARTED IN THEIR BEDS AND LISTENED
SHE SAW ALWYN SWING ALONG THE ROAD TO THE SCHOOL DINING-ROOM WHERE HE HAD CHARGE OF THE STUDENTS AT THE NOONDAY MEAL
MARY TAYLOR AGAIN ALONE SAT DOWN AT A TURN IN THE PATH JUST OUT OF SIGHT OF THE HOUSE AND WAITED
THEN MISS TAYLOR SAID ABSENTLY
I WAS SURE IT WAS COMING BUT I WANTED TO GIVE COLONEL CRESSWELL EVERY CHANCE
THROUGH HIM I EARN MY BREAD AND BUTTER
I DO NOT BLAME YOU SAID ZORA GENTLY
ALL THIS HE DESIRED--ARDENTLY DESIRED
ARE YOU WITH HIS BARGAIN QUICKLY
THE STREET WAS A PROMINENT ONE THE BLOCK ONE OF THE BEST THE HOUSE ALMOST PRETENTIOUS
I'VE MADE A MILLION OR SO MYSELF HE ADDED REFLECTIVELY
WHY HAD THEY NOT LET HER SEE THE CHILD--JUST ONE LOOK AT ITS LITTLE DEAD FACE
AND SHE BEGAN A LONG JOURNEY TO REACH HER WINDOW AND CHAIR--A LONG LONG JOURNEY
YET HE REFLECTED WHY NOT
BUT--BUT--COME
YES--I RECKON SHE DRAWLED PRETTILY SWINGING HER FOOT AND WATCHING THE TREE-TOPS ABOVE THE DISTANT SWAMP
BUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN LOVES JUSTICE AND RIGHT AND HE IS THE ONE TO WHOM I APPEAL WITH FRANKNESS AND TRUTH
I'VE GOT A LITTLE MONEY ZORA HE SAID QUICKLY
THERE'S A YOUNG CLERK IN THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT NAMED ALWYN WHO HAS BRAINS
IT WAS THAT WASHINGTON GIRL THEN
THEN HE KEENLY SCRUTINIZED THE YOUNG WOMAN AND SHE STEADILY RETURNED HIS REGARD
THE RESULT WAS TWO-FOLD
A SCREAM STRUGGLED IN HER BREAST HER FINGERS RELAXED AND THE BIG BEAST STRETCHING HIS CRAMPED NECK ROSE IN ONE MIGHTY PLUNGE AND PLANTED HIS FEET ON THE SAND OF THE ISLAND
MRS VANDERPOOL JUST RETURNED FROM A SHOPPING TOUR BURST INTO LAUGHTER
THAT'S SO BUT LOOK HERE
I WILL COME TO-MORROW SAID ZORA
IT'S COME ZORA REGARDED HER COLDLY AND STOOD AT BAY
BUT SHE TOSSED HER HEAD AND HER EYES GREW SCORNFUL
A MOMENT THE MISTS IN HER EYES SHUT OUT THE SHADOWS OF THE SWAMP AND THE ROARING IN HER EARS MADE A SILENCE OF THE WORLD
MR CRESSWELL SAYS THEY OWN ALMOST NO LAND HERE
CRESSWELL AROSE
MRS VANDERPOOL GLANCED INVOLUNTARILY AT HER GOWN AND SMILED AS SHE DID IT
I SENT FOR HIM
WE WANT A COOPERATIVE STORE FOR BUYING SUPPLIES
MRS GREY WAS A PORTLY WOMAN INCLINED TO THINK MUCH OF HER DINNER AND HER CLOTHES BOTH OF WHICH WERE ALWAYS RICH AND COSTLY
IT HELD HER BY A GROWING FASCINATION AND SHE WAS ANXIOUS FOR THE OLDER WOMAN TO AMPLIFY
MR TEERSWELL NODDED EASILY AND TURNED AWAY CONTINUING HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE LADIES
SHE REMEMBERED HOW FORGOTTEN YEARS AGO SHE HAD OFTEN GONE A DAY WITHOUT EATING AND THOUGHT LITTLE OF IT
WE'RE ALL TALKING OF IT ALL THE TIME SHE SAID
SHE WAS NOT SURE
THE BEST WAY HE DECLARED IS TO GO TO MONTGOMERY AND GET A FIRST-CLASS LAWYER AND JUST FIGHT THE THING THROUGH
BY HIS HELP SHE MADE OUT THAT LAST YEAR HIS TOTAL BILL AT CRESSWELL'S STORE WAS PERHAPS FORTY DOLLARS
I RECKON YOU'RE RIGHT
HIS APPARENT SUCCESS HAD BEEN TOO SUDDEN TOO OVERWHELMING AND WHEN HE HAD FACED THE CRISIS HIS HAND HAD TREMBLED
I WAS APPOINTED BUT BLES ASKED COLDLY
IT BROUGHT BACK SOMETHING OF THE OLD UNEASINESS AND SUSPICION
THESE MEN ARE NOT POLITICIANS NOR POPULAR LEADERS BUT THEY HAVE INFLUENCE AND ARE USING IT
SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP ALMOST WITHOUT RELIGION SAVE SOME FEW MYSTIC REMNANTS OF A HALF-FORGOTTEN HEATHEN CULT
THE PIN IS MINE
THAT IS BEST HE SAID AND THEN HE ADDED SLOWLY I WOULD NOT LIKE YOU EVER TO DESPISE ME SHE ANSWERED SHARPLY
AT LAST THERE CAME A DAY WHEN THEY LET HER WALK DOWN TO THE PORCH AND SHE FELT THE FLICKERING OF HER STRENGTH AGAIN
IS THAT ALL NO SIR
THE FELLOW'S IMPUDENCE WAS SURE TO INCREASE AND THEN
THE DARK OF THE MOON BOY THE DARK OF THE MOON--THE FIRST DARK--AT MIDNIGHT BLES COULD NOT WRING ANOTHER WORD FROM HER
BUT EVER AND ANON HE GLANCED CURIOUSLY BACK
WAS SHE PRETTY HE ASKED
NO SHE HAD ALWAYS REJECTED IT
HE ORDERED BOOKS FROM THE NORTH HE SUBSCRIBED FOR FINANCIAL JOURNALS HE RECEIVED SPECIAL TELEGRAPHIC REPORTS ONLY TO TOSS THEM AWAY CURSE HIS VALET AND CALL FOR ANOTHER BRANDY
THREE THOUSAND POUNDS HE ANNOUNCED IN A CARELESS TONE
BUT WHY PROLONG THE THING YOU SEE SHE'S GOT YOUR COTTON TIED BY INJUNCTION I DON'T SEE HOW SHE DID IT EASY ENOUGH
HE HASTENED AFTER HER BUT SHE FLEW FAST AND FASTER
A WILD TERROR GRIPPED HER
BUT STILLINGS WAS A PATIENT RESOLUTE MAN BENEATH HIS DEFERENTIAL EXTERIOR AND HE SAW IN BLES A STEPPING STONE
I'LL STICK EM INTO THE CHAIN-GANG EVERY CHANCE I GET ON THE OTHER HAND INSPIRED BY FRIGHT THE GRIP OF THE LANDLORDS ON THE BLACK SERFS CLOSED WITH STEADILY INCREASING FIRMNESS
DOES HE HE ASKED SMILING
THE COLONEL SAW HER TOO AND WAS UNEASY FOR HE KNEW THAT MISS SMITH HAD A SHARP TONGUE AND A MOST DISCONCERTING METHOD OF ARGUMENT WHICH HE AS A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN COURTEOUS TO ALL WHITE FEMALES EVEN IF THEY DID EAT WITH NIGGERS COULD NOT PROPERLY ANSWER
HE'LL BE PASSING THROUGH MONTGOMERY THE FIRST OF NEXT MONTH AND PROPOSES CALLING I'LL WIRE HIM TO COME SAID HARRY PROMPTLY
HOW YOU KNOW HE ASKED AT LAST SKEPTICALLY
LET'S SEE--YOUR RENT AND RATIONS ELSPETH PAYS NO RENT SHE SAID SLOWLY BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR
CONSEQUENTLY HE MADE OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK WITH MRS CRESSWELL WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT HOPING SHE WOULD BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF ZORA OF HER OWN ACCORD
COLONEL CRESSWELL AND MR TOLLIVER HAD THEM ALL CHARGED WITH LARGE SUMS OF INDEBTEDNESS AND THESE SUMS HAD TO BE ASSUMED BY THE SCHOOL
IF HE SHOULD ATTACK THE PARTY BUT HE WOULDN'T CRIED MISS WYNN WITH A START THAT BELIED HER CONVICTION
AND YET SOMEHOW SITTING THERE ALONE IN THE FIRELIGHT SHE FELT GLAD FOR ONCE THAT SHE HAD RISEN ABOVE INTRIGUE
STRIVE--WORK--BUILD--HEW--LEAD--INSPIRE
AS AN INVESTMENT HE DID NOT CONSIDER MARY A SUCCESS
BUT HE WENT
YES'M PLEASE HE SAID
INDEED IT IS A DEEP ETHICAL QUERY IS IT NOT HOW FAR ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BEAR BLACK CHILDREN TO THE WORLD IN THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE
THIS HE PUT INTO JOHN TAYLOR'S HANDS TO INVEST IN THE SOUTH IN BANK STOCK AND INDUSTRIES WITH THE IDEA OF PLAYING A PART IN THE FINANCIAL SITUATION THERE
THIS IS MY SCHEME
AND YET ONCE IN THE HANDS OF THESE PAST-MASTERS OF DEBT-MANIPULATION WOULD HER SCHOOL BE SAFE
WITH A SNARL A CROWD OF SOME HALF-DOZEN WHITE FACES RUSHED FORWARD WAVERED AND STOPPED
SO I CAME TO YOU TO SAY--TO SAY YOU MUSTN'T PAY THE PRICE AND I LIED SAID MRS VANDERPOOL
ABOVE ALL FLEW THE DREAM THE PHANTASY THE MEMORY OF THE PAST THE VISION OF THE FUTURE
PERSONALLY I'M AT SEA
ENTER IT UNDER THE NAME OF WYNN IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL INVITATIONS TO THE ART EXHIBIT NUMBERS OF SPECIAL ONES WERE ISSUED TO PROMISING SOUTHERN AMATEURS WHO HAD NEVER EXHIBITED
I'M GOING HE SAID
MISS WYNN PLACED HER HAND LIGHTLY ON BLES'S ARM AND FOR A MOMENT HE PAUSED
HIS NEIGHBORS REGARDED IT WITH DISCONCERTING EQUANIMITY
SHE WELCOMED HIM CORDIALLY MADE A LITTLE MUSIC FOR HIM AND SERVED TEA
THEY LASHED THEIR MULES AND DRANK THEIR WHISKEY AND ALL NIGHT THE PILED FLEECE SWEPT BY MARY TAYLOR'S WINDOW FLYING--FLYING TO THAT FAR CRY
NONE NOTICED ALL
HE PROPOUNDED A DOZEN QUESTIONS SHARP SEARCHING QUESTIONS AND HE WANTED THE ANSWERS TOMORROW
DEAR GOD HOW FLAT THE WORD FELL
YOU KNOW BLES USED TO IMAGINE HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH YOU JUST AS HE DID AFTERWARD WITH MISS WYNN MISS--WYNN YES THE WASHINGTON GIRL
IF YOU DON'T GET THE NIGGERS FIRST THEY'LL USE EM AS A CLUB TO THROW YOU DOWN
MRS VANDERPOOL LAY IN THE QUIET DARKENED ROOM WITH A PUZZLED SMILE ON HER LIPS
A SCORE OF VOICES YELLED AND LAUGHED
AND HE CALLS ON HER EVERY NIGHT TEERSWELL SAT DOWN LIMPLY
THEY DON'T ZACTLY BELIEVE IT BUT THEY HAS TO LOW THAT YOU DIDN'T SAY MUCH BOUT RELIGION WHEN YOU TALKED
THEY WOULD NOT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
SLOWLY WONDERFULLY THE FLOWERS SPREAD--WHITE BLUE AND PURPLE BELLS HIDING TIMIDLY BLAZING LUXURIANTLY AMID THE VELVET LEAVES
NOR WAS THIS UNNATURAL
SURELY THERE MUST BE MANY FRIENDS OF OUR RACE WILLING TO STAND FOR THE RIGHT AND SACRIFICE FOR IT SHE LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY ALMOST MOCKINGLY
WHERE ZORA
HER EYES SHIFTED UNEASILY
CRESSWELL SUBSCRIBED TO A CLIPPING-BUREAU AND TASTED THE SWEETS OF DAWNING NOTORIETY AND MRS CRESSWELL ARRANGED A SELECT DINNER-PARTY WHICH INCLUDED A CABINET OFFICER A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR TWO MILLIONAIRES AND THE LEADING SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN
NOTHING OF THE SORT
DOES ONE APPEAL TO THE RED-EYED BEAST THAT THROTTLES HIM
SHE DID NOT MOVE BUT LIFTED BOTH HER DARK HANDS WHITE WITH COTTON
OH BY THE BYE SAID MR CRESSWELL FROWNING AND HESITATING OVER THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS ERRAND'S PURPOSE THERE WAS ONE MATTER"--HE PAUSED
THERE HAD BEEN GOOD AND BAD HONEST AND DECEPTIVE FRANK AND FURTIVE
I HATES YOU THE TEACHER IN MISS TAYLOR STROVE TO REBUKE THIS UNCONVENTIONAL GREETING BUT THE WOMAN IN HER SPOKE FIRST AND ASKED ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW IT WHY FIVE ZORA ZORA CHILD OF THE SWAMP WAS A HEATHEN HOYDEN OF TWELVE WAYWARD UNTRAINED YEARS
SHE DID NOT CARE
THE DASHING YOUNG MISS EASTERLY WAS MORE TO HIS TASTE
HUMPH
ON THIS SIDE LAY SUCCESS
LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE THUNDERED OUT OF THE BARN ON THE BLACK MARE
BLES SHE SAID QUIETLY IT IS REPORTED THAT A TOOMSVILLE MOB WILL BURN THE SCHOOL TONIGHT BLES STOOD MOTIONLESS
IT WAS GOING TO BE EASIER THAN HE SUPPOSED
SHE LAY IN THE STUPOR OF HER LAST MORNING NAP AFTER A NIGHT OF HARROWING WORRY
AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF MARY TURNED TO MISS SMITH
OH SEND ALWYN'S BACK I HAVE
THERE SAID MR CRESSWELL
EVEN THERE THINGS ARE MIXED SHE LOOKED SADLY AT MRS VANDERPOOL AND THE FEAR THAT HAD BEEN HOVERING BEHIND HER MISTRESS'S EYES BECAME VISIBLE
YOU SURE IS PRETTY DIS EVENING WHY AUNT RACHEL HOW ARE YOU THERE WAS GENUINE PLEASURE IN THE GIRL'S TONE
DRIVE ON JOHN MISS TAYLOR FELT THAT HER WORST SUSPICIONS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED
AND ZORA SAT ABOVE THEM ON A HIGH RICH-SCENTED PILE OF LOGS
AIN'T THAT ALL NO
THEN TOO HE DID NOT WANT TO BE TOO INFLEXIBLE FOR ALL OF HIS PEOPLE KNEW ZORA AND LIKED HER
THE TRUST HAS GOT MONEY AND CREDIT ENOUGH TO FORCE IT DOWN WELL WHAT THEN THE COLONEL GLARED
IS IT?--IS IT WHISPERED THE DEVILS WITHIN
ZO-RA O--O--OH ZORA HE SAW FAR BEHIND HIM TOWARD THE SHADOWS OF THE SWAMP AN OLD WOMAN--SHORT BROAD BLACK AND WRINKLED WITH FANGS AND PENDULOUS LIPS AND RED WICKED EYES
MIND YOU--IF YOU CAN PERSUADE HER
NEVER--NEVER AGAIN HE SLOWLY ANSWERED HER
IF IT IS I WANT IT STOPPED
YET THIS CHILDISH FRIENDSHIP WAS SO NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE A THING TO HER THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT
TAYLOR WE'RE READY--GO SOUTH AND JOHN TAYLOR ROSE SHOOK HANDS SILENTLY AND WENT
WANTS TO BORROW MORE MONEY I PRESUME HE WENT DOWN-STAIRS AFTER FIRST HELPING HIMSELF TO A GLASS OF WHISKEY AND THEN GALLANTLY KISSING HIS WIFE
IS THAT WOMAN'S BROTHER GOING TO SPEND THIS MONEY
THE ROOM BOWED AND WHIRLED ABOUT
IT'S A LIE SHE CRIED WITH HOARSE EARNEDSTNESS THE WAY NOWHERE
TO CONTINUE IN SCHOOL MEANT CHARITY YET SHE HAD NOWHERE TO GO AND NOTHING TO GO WITH
THIS WAS ESPECIALLY THE CASE WITH THE NATIONAL EDUCATION BILL AND THE AMENDMENT TO THE CHILD LABOR BILL
YOU'RE TIRED OUT SO IS YOU WAS HER REPLY
CHANGE AT CHARLOTTE HE SNAPPED AS HE WENT ON
IT WAS WELL
GOOBERS UNCOMPREHENDINGLY
SHALL I MAKE HIM AN ENEMY
HE HAD SCARCELY REACHED THE HIGHWAY AND RIDDEN A QUARTER OF A MILE OR SO WHEN HE SPIED BLES ALWYN HURRYING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARD THE CRESSWELL OAKS
AND THEN WITH BLARE OF BAND AND PRANCING OF HORSES HE HAD BEEN WHIRLED DOWN THE DIP AND CURVE OF THAT LONG AVENUE WITH ITS MEDLEY OF MEANNESS AND THRIFT AND HURRY AND WEALTH UNTIL SWINGING SHARPLY THE DIM WALLS OF THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE BEFORE HIM
NO--NOT BETTER THAN SHE KNOWS BUT JUST AS GOOD SHE TREMBLED HAPPILY
NOW I WONDER WHERE THEY GOT THE MUSIC
AND YET SHE SEEMED TO SEE SOME POINTS OF PENETRATION
SHE SMILED
THEN PRETTY SOON THERE COMES A SORT OF GREENNESS ON THE BLACK LAND AND IT SWELLS AND GROWS AND AND--SHIVERS
SHE SPOKE A LANGUAGE DIFFERENT FROM HIS AND SHE HAD SHOWN A DISCONCERTING WAY IN THE FEW TIMES WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN WITH HER OF LETTING THE WEIGHT OF THE CONVERSATION REST ON HIM
THE LITTLE SHE HAD SEEN OF RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE HAD NOT MOVED HER GREATLY SAVE ONCE YONDER IN WASHINGTON
AND THEY MARVELLED
BUT ABOVE ALL AND IN ALL RUSHING THROUGH PILED AND FLYING BOUND AND BALED--WAS COTTON
JUST A FLURRY I RECKON
IT'S NONE O MY BUSINESS OF COURSE
IT WAS NOT ULTRA-FASHIONABLE BUT IT HAD WEALTH AND LEISURE AND SOME BREEDING
DR BOLDISH WAS BEGINNING TO TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN A SILENCE FELL
DO YOU KNOW MR VANDERPOOL HAS DEVELOPED A QUITE UNACCOUNTABLE LIKING FOR THE IDEA OF BEING AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE DEAR ME MILDLY EXCLAIMED MR EASTERLY HELPING HIMSELF LIBERALLY TO CAKES
IF ALL THESE FOLK WERE LIKE POOR STUPID DOCILE JENNIE IT WOULD BE SIMPLER BUT WHAT EARTHLY SENSE WAS THERE IN TRYING DO TO ANYTHING WITH A GIRL LIKE ZORA SO STUPID IN SOME MATTERS SO STARTLINGLY BRIGHT IN OTHERS AND SO STUBBORN IN EVERYTHING
WHAT'S THIS NIGGER CHARGED WITH DEMANDED THE JUDGE WHEN THE FIRST BLACK BOY WAS BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM
THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT HE ADMITTED BUT WHAT CAN WE DO
WELL--I HE BEGAN LAMELY
IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THAT ALL OVER THE WORLD IS IT IT'S WORSE AFFIRMED MISS WYNN QUIETLY POSITIVE
BUT SHE LIFTED HER HEAD
SHE SILENT PASSIVE BUT HER EYES RESTLESS
WELL THE BATTLE'S OVER ISN'T IT NO IT'S JUST BEGUN JUST BEGUN ECHOED MARY IN AMAZEMENT
SHE APPEALED TO MISS TAYLOR'S RUDDIER AND DAINTIER VISION BUT DIMLY AND DISTANTLY AS SOME MEMORY OF THE PAST
ONE IS SURE TO BE DISAPPOINTED THEN WHAT'S THE USE OF SEEING THE WORLD WHY ONE MUST LIVE
WELL OF ALL THINGS BLES--ER--AH--MR ALWYN
SURELY THIS WAS NO NETHER WORLD
AT DINNER SHE TRIED ALL HER POWERS ON HIM
THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH TOBACCO SMOKE
THE MEETING HAD OVERFLOWED THE CHURCH AND SPREAD TO THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP
I THOUGHT YOU WAS A MAN SHE SAID
MR CRESSWELL HALTED AND STARED
WE'LL JUST TAKE IT TO THEM AND GIVE THEM HALF LIKE THE OTHER TENANTS BUT THE SWAMP IS MORTAL THICK AND HARD TO CLEAR WE CAN DO IT ZORA HAD SAT STILL LISTENING
YES HE FINALLY ANSWERED
BECAUSE HE HESITATED AND HIS CHEEKS GREW HOT
SHE SAW WITH SOME LONG INNER SIGHT A VAST HALL WITH MIGHTY PILLARS
WE FLY RIGHT THROUGH THEM
WHO HAD PUT THE VEIL THERE
WITH THE WORK OF ALWYN HOWEVER ALL DOUBT DISAPPEARED AND THERE WAS LITTLE REASON FOR DENYING THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT WALKED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF AN UNKNOWN GEORGIA NEGRO LITTLE PAST HIS MAJORITY
AS SHE CAME IN FULL VIEW OF THE DOOR SHE PAUSED
A FEW BLACKS WHISPERED IN ONE CORNER
HER HEAD SWAM AGAIN AND THE BLOOD FLASHED IN HER EYES
IT WAS AN ANNIVERSARY AND PERHAPS SHE STILL REMEMBERED THAT MOMENT THAT SUPREME MOMENT BEFORE THE MOB
ALWYN WAS WATCHING HIM WHEN A FAINT NOISE CAME TO HIM ON THE EASTERN BREEZE--A LOW RUMBLING MURMUR
TICKETS WHERE CAN WE BUY THEM NOT ON SALE WAS THE CURT REPLY
WHERE NOW ZORA HE CRIED
YAS'M
YAS'M
THEN EASTERLY PROPOSED BUYING CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CERTAIN LARGE MILLS AND GRADUALLY CONSOLIDATING THEM
FOR A WHILE SHE RAN EASILY AND SWIFTLY
NOT UNTIL THEN DID ZORA STEAL FORTH FROM HER HIDING-PLACE
THEY MET ONLY LAST NIGHT BUT I DID NOT GO
SHE WAS A LITTLE LATE AND A HUSH GREETED HER
WITH A SATISFIED SMILE HARRY CRESSWELL HAD SEEN THE NORTHERN GIRL DISAPPEAR TOWARD THE SWAMP
THE SILVER FLEECE HAD RETURNED TO HER
AND DAT'S WHAT I COMES TO ASK YOU ABOUT GOODNESS ME
HE BEGAN TO WHISPER AMONG HIS FRIENDS
SHE EXPLAINED HER BUSINESS
BUT NOT FOR YEARS
HIS HAND WAS IRON AND HE RAISED IT SLIGHTLY
WHY NOT GO BACK TO THE SOUTH WHERE SHE HAD GONE
MISS SMITH REPRESENTED THE OLDER NEW ENGLAND OF HER PARENTS--HONEST INSCRUTABLE DETERMINED WITH A CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WORSHIPPED AND UTTERLY UNSELFISH
THE THIN BLOODLESS LIPS FORMED A SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING PLEASANT
DON'T FORGET THE MAN DEAR SHE REMINDED HIM
HE NOT ONLY FETCHED HER FLOWERS BUT FLOWERS THAT CHIMED WITH DAY AND GOWN AND SEASON--ALMOST WITH MOOD
YES--SHE FELT FORCED TO CLOSE THE BARGAIN
THAT FARMING IS THE ONLY THING WE OUGHT TO TRY TO DO AND I RECKON SHE THINKS THERE AIN'T MUCH CHANCE EVEN THERE ROBERT FARMING IS A NOBLE CALLING
GREY HESITATED BUT EASTERLY PUSHED HIM ON AND HE MADE HIS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
ALWYN MUST BE WARNED
MOREOVER AS A BLACK WOMAN FIGHTING A HOPELESS BATTLE WITH LANDLORDS I'LL GAIN THE ONE THING LACKING WHAT'S THAT THE SYMPATHY OF THE COURT AND THE BYSTANDERS PSHAW
BUT MRS CRESSWELL FOUND HER PERFECT AND BEGAN TO SCHEME TO MARRY HER OFF
HE HAD SOLD THE SCHOOL ITS FIRST LAND TO PIQUE THE CRESSWELLS
THE WORD CONCEALS SO MUCH
WHEN THE EVENING CAME AND THE STUDENTS WERE MARCHING AND THE TEACHERS SAVE MISS SMITH WERE SITTING RATHER PRIMLY APART AND COMMENTING SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT WHITE-BODIED AND WHITE-LIMBED BUT DARK AND VELVET-ARMED HER FULL NECK AND OVAL HEAD RISING RICH AND ALMOST BLACK ABOVE WITH ITS DEEP-LIGHTED EYES AND CROWN OF SILENT DARKLING HAIR
WHEN IT CAME BACK TO HER AS COME IT MUST SHE CRIED WITH CLENCHED HANDS IT WOULD BRING HAPPINESS
MY GOD THEN AT LENGTH SHE SAID TO ZORA
A SYSTEM OF WAREHOUSES AND WAREHOUSE CERTIFICATES WAS PROPOSED
AFTER THEY WERE GONE SHE CAME BACK AND CLOSED THE DOORS
HE CALLED IN A SPECTACLED MAN WITH BUSHY EYEBROWS AND A SLEEPY LOOK
I'VE ENGAGED ZORA LAUGHED MRS VANDERPOOL LIGHTLY
SHE HAD ALREADY RECOGNIZED THAT WHILE HER TASTES AND HER HUSBAND'S WERE MOSTLY ALIKE THEY WERE ALSO STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT IN MANY RESPECTS
WE'LL PUT THE COTTON INSPECTION BILL THROUGH IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE SESSION--SEE
GRANDFATHER HE REPEATED SOFTLY
I'LL DO IT NELL
MY NAME IS WYNN LOWERING HER VOICE SLIGHTLY AND LEANING TOWARD HIM
THE DEVIL WITHIN WAS TOO FOND OF TAKING THE BIT IN HIS TEETH
WHY THAT'S THE SUBJECT UP TONIGHT STILLINGS DECLARED AND MISS WYNN WILL BE SURE TO BE THERE
AND ZORA CAME JUST AS THE SUN THREW ITS LAST CRIMSON THROUGH THE BLACK SWAMP
SITTING BACK HE EYED THE YOUNG MAN
ANOTHER HOUR FLEW BY BEFORE ZORA HURRIED DOWN
I KNOWS WHERE THE SUN RISES AND I KNOWS WHERE IT SETS SHE LOOKED UP AT ITS GLEAMING SPLENDOR GLINTING THROUGH THE LEAVES AND NOTING ITS HEIGHT ANNOUNCED ABRUPTLY
HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS EXPECTING INDEED RATHER HOPING TO FIND TAYLOR IMPATIENTLY STRIDING TO AND FRO WATCH IN HAND
SHE BOWED AND SMILED LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST AND SURPRISE
AGAIN MRS VANDERPOOL LAUGHED BUT AFTER TEA SHE WANDERED IDLY DOWN THE ROAD
BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKETH AWAY SIN
NO SHODDY UPSTARTS DEM BUT BORN TO PURPLE LADY BORN TO PURPLE
WHEN THE SERVANT WENT OUT AND CLOSED THE DOOR SHE PAUSED A MOMENT CONSIDERING WHETHER TO OPEN BY APPEAL OR EXPLANATION
THEN IT MEANT DISAPPOINTMENT TO A SCORE OF RAGGED URCHINS NOW IT MEANT TWO HUNDRED BOYS AND GIRLS THE SPIRITS OF A THOUSAND GONE BEFORE AND THE HOPES OF THOUSANDS TO COME
MARY CRESSWELL PAUSED A MOMENT IN TRIUMPH LOOKING BACK AT THE DARKENED HALL WHEN A LITTLE WOMAN FLUTTERED UP TO HER AND WHISPERED
YET NOW HE WAS ALONE
WHY NOT SEND ZORA
WE WANT A COTTON-GIN AND SAW-MILL AND IN THE FUTURE OTHER THINGS
SHE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO RECEIVE THE CHECK BUT SHE HAD NOT EXAMINED IT
I LOWED VICTUALS WOULD FETCH YOU GRUMBLED THE HAG
HE LOOKED HIMSELF OVER RUEFULLY AND DROPPING HIS AXE SAT DOWN BESIDE HER ON A GREAT LOG
THEY HAD GREAT DEEDS IN MIND
NO SOONER WAS HARRY CRESSWELL'S TELEGRAM AT HAND THAN HE HASTENED BACK FROM SAVANNAH STRUCK ACROSS COUNTRY AND THE WEEK AFTER HIS SISTER'S RIDE FOUND HIM STRIDING UP THE CARRIAGE-WAY OF THE CRESSWELL HOME
YOU HAVE PLENTY AND ONE CAN'T EXPECT YOUR SERVICES OR INFLUENCE FOR NOTHING
SHE GOT OUT HER WEDDING-DRESS AND ALTHOUGH IT HUNG LOOSELY THE MAID DRAPED THE SILVER FLEECE BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT HER
PERHAPS SHE WAS A LITTLE MORBID THAT SHE WOULD FAIL OF RECOGNITION AS A LADY
HE CAUGHT THE WHITE FLUTTER OF HER DRESS AND SMILED INDULGENTLY AS HE WATCHED AND WAITED AND LIGHTLY PUFFED HIS CIGARETTE
FAINT AFAR NEARER AND NEARER AND EVER MIGHTIER ROSE A SONG OF MYSTIC MELODY
HE SAW NOTHING BUT A CROWD OF QUEER LOOKING PEOPLE DOING THINGS THEY WERE NOT MADE TO DO AND APPEARING ABSURDLY HAPPY OVER IT
AND WHAT SHE DREAMED THERE IN THE GOLDEN DAY SHE DARED NOT FORMULATE EVEN TO HER OWN SOUL
AMBASSADORSHIPS COME--HIGH SHE SAID WITH A CATCH IN HER VOICE
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS AND HIS LIPS BREATHED--"ZORA HE TURNED HASTILY TO HIS DESK AND LOOKED AT THE OTHER PIECE OF MAIL--A SINGLE SEALED NOTE CAREFULLY WRITTEN ON HEAVY PAPER
IF YOU DON'T GO I WAIT
IF COTTON GOES TO TWELVE CENTS WE CAN PAY OUT AND BE FREE AND SHE THREW HER APRON OVER HER HEAD AND WEPT GATHERING HER CHILDREN IN HER ARMS
THERE WAS HAPPINESS AND HOPE AGAIN IN THE CABINS AND HOPE AND--IF NOT HAPPINESS AMBITION IN THE MANSIONS
THE NEWLY ELECTED JUDGE HAD NOT YET TAKEN HIS SEAT AND CRESSWELL'S WORD WAS STILL LAW IN THE COURT
THE TOPS OF YOUNG TREES HAD BEEN BENT DOWN AND INTERLACED TO FORM A COVERING AND BENCHES TWINED TO THEIR TRUNKS
WHAT NEW FORCE WAS HE LOOSENING AGAINST HIS BLACK FOLK--HIS OWN BLACK FOLK WHO HAD LIVED ABOUT HIM AND HIS FATHERS NIGH THREE HUNDRED YEARS
SHE THOUGHT OF MISS WYNN WHO HAD JILTED ALWYN AND GIVEN HER HERSELF A VERY BAD QUARTER OF AN HOUR
I KNOW WHAT SLAVERY IS
SWIFT SILENT MESSENGERS HURRIED IN AND OUT AND MR EASTERLY DECIDING THE TIME WAS RIPE CALLED HIS HENCHMAN TO HIM
BUT HE PURSUED THE SUBJECT
THEY NEED A LESSON AND BY GAD
DID GOD ASK THAT TOO
HE WAS ANXIOUS FOR AN ALLIANCE
ONCE OUT OF THE CLUTCH OF THE CRESSWELLS--WELL I THINK WE CAN HAVE A COAT OF PAINT AND HE LAUGHED AS HE HAD NOT LAUGHED IN TEN YEARS
THE KALEIDOSCOPIC PANORAMA OF A WORLD'S DOING THE MYRIAD FORMS AND FACES THE TALK AND LAUGHTER OF MEN
HE WAS RAGING WITH IMPATIENCE SHE RETURNED
HE SAYS SHE'S UTTERLY DEPRAVED SAID THAT DID HE MISS SMITH WATCHED HER WITH TRANQUIL REGARD
THE BLACK MAN STOPPED WITH HUMILITY BEFORE THE TRAP AND SWEPT A PROFOUND OBEISANCE
AND HE WAS FOR SLEEP AND TEMPERANCE AND THE WOOING OF A WOMAN HAD PUT A TINGE IN HIS MARBLE FACE SMOOTHED THE PUFFS BENEATH HIS EYES AND GIVEN HIM A MORE DISTINGUISHED BEARING AND A FIRMER HAND
THE MEN BECAME RESTLESS AND JOHNSON BEGAN TO EDGE AWAY TOWARD THE LOWER HALL
HE MUST SEE
FOR THE TIME OF COTTON-PLANTING WAS COMING
EVEN IF WHITE FOLKS DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THEY KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS FROM US AND WE OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNOW THIS APPEALED TO HER SOMEWHAT
BLES SLOWLY SAT DOWN AGAIN AND AFTER A PAUSE SAID THANK YOU SHE LOOKED UP QUICKLY BUT HE SEEMED QUITE SERIOUS AND GOOD-NATURED
WHAT'S A SHAME ASKED COLONEL CRESSWELL
NO BUT IT IS MINE WHY IS IT YOURS BECAUSE IT WAS GIVEN TO ME BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT
SILENCE AND RENEWED MURMURING ENSUED AND THE SOUND OF HIGH VOICES IN DISPUTE
SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING TO SEE MR CRESSWELL ABOUT THE CUT TIMBER ON HER LAND
ZORA LISTENED LEAPT TO HER FEET AND STARTED TO THE DOOR
TO BE SURE
AND ESPECIALLY AMERICA
THE SILVER FLEECE LAY LIKE A MIGHTY MANTLE ACROSS THE EARTH
THE DARK MYSTERY OF THE SWAMP SWEPT OVER HER
SHE HAD DREAMED THE DETAILS OF DOING THIS SO LONG THAT IT SEEMED ALREADY DONE AND SHE COULD IMAGINE NO OBSTACLE TO ITS REALIZATION
COLONEL CRESSWELL AND HIS SON IN THESE DAYS HAD A LONG AND EARNEST CONVERSATION PERFORATED HERE AND THERE BY EXPLOSIONS OF THE COLONEL'S WRATH
I WANT JUSTICE MRS CRESSWELL AROSE AND HER FACE WAS WHITE
TO SAY CALMLY NO
HAPPILY SHE CROONED BACK A LOW MOTHER-MELODY AND WAITED
THE COTTON INSPECTION BILL--OUR CHIEF MEASURE--MUST BE SLIPPED THROUGH QUIETLY BY SOUTHERN VOTES WHILE IN THE TARIFF MIX-UP WE MUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF COTTON
SHE SNIFFED THE CHILLING AIR AND WAS SURE SHE CAUGHT SOME LINGERING PERFUME FROM MRS VANDERPOOL'S GOWN
IT HAD BEEN OF THAT BLONDE WHITE-AND-PINK TYPE THAT FADES IN A FLASH AND ITS GOING LEFT HER BODY FLATTENED AND ANGULAR HER SKIN DRAWN AND DEAD WHITE HER EYES SUNKEN
