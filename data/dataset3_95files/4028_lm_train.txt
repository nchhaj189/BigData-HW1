UPON MY ARRIVAL IN ROME I WENT TO WORK IN THE SHOP OF THE MASTER-GOLDSMITH SANTI
YOU ARE THE POPES PRISONER. I ANSWERED
THEN BREAKING INTO ONE OF HIS MALIGNANT LAUGHS AND WAGGING HIS HEAD HE TURNED TO THE DUKE AND SAID
IN THE MIDST OF THIS TUMULT THE INNKEEPER SCREAMED OUT
LIKE THAT I REMAINED FROM DAWN UNTIL THE NINETEENTH HOUR WHEN THEY BROUGHT MY FOOD
YET I PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND TOLD MYSELF THAT THESE MEDALS HAD WON ME SO MUCH CELEBRITY THAT ANY POPE WHO WAS ELECTED WOULD GIVE ME WORK TO DO AND PERADVENTURE BRING ME BETTER FORTUNE
WHEN I GOT TO ROME I DISMOUNTED AT THE PALACE OF CARDINAL DE MEDICI AND HAVING OBTAINED AN AUDIENCE OF HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP PAID MY RESPECTS AND THANKED HIM WARMLY FOR MY RECALL
THEREFORE I ACCEPTED COMMISSIONS FROM SEVERAL NOBLEMEN
IN SPITE OF HIS WORDS AND FENCING HE RECEIVED A FLESH WOUND IN THE MOUTH
UNWONTED AND APPALLING TERROR ASTONISHED EVERY ONE AND ME MORE EVEN THAN THE REST
BUT INASMUCH AS GOD DOES SOMETIME MERCIFULLY INTERVENE HE SO ORDERED THAT NEITHER THEY NOR I DID ANY HARM TO ONE ANOTHER
THIS AFFAIR LED ME TO PLAY MORE THAN I WAS USED TO DO
THEY WERE DELIGHTED AND THE DUKE SAID TO THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN
AND WHAT IS MORE I TELL YOU THAT JUST BECAUSE OF YOU I WILL NOT SET HAND FURTHER TO MY PIECE
THOSE WHO REMAINED UPRIGHT PLIED BOTH HANDS WITH ALL THEIR FORCE GIVING IT ME WITH HAMMERS CUDGELS AND ANVIL
FOR YOUR SAKE WE WILL LEAVE HIM QUIET
LXI MEANWHILE I WAS ADVANCING WITH MY GREAT STATUE OF MEDUSA
AT THAT TIME YOU WERE IN THIS CASTLE OF SANT ANGELO AND WERE EMPLOYED AS BOMBARDIER
PATIENCE PATIENCE, SEVERAL TIMES
I WILL NOT DO TO YOU WHAT YOU DESERVE
LUCAGNOLOS WAS A HUGE SILVER PIECE USED AT THE TABLE OF POPE CLEMENT INTO WHICH HE FLUNG AWAY BITS OF BONE AND THE RIND OF DIVERS FRUITS WHILE EATING
AND SO IN THE END I USED TO CHEER UP A LITTLE WITH MY FRIEND AND DROVE AWAY AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE SOME FEW OF THE GLOOMY THOUGHTS WHICH WEIGHED UPON ME
THE PROVOST OF PARIS WAS THEN IN POSSESSION OF IT FROM HIS MAJESTY
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THE ANCIENTS WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF ANATOMY AND THEREFORE THEIR WORKS ABOUND IN MISTAKES. I KEPT SILENCE AND PAID NO HEED TO WHAT HE WAS SAYING
WE WERE THEN IN THE FIRST YEARS OF POPE GIULIO DE MONTI
WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT AND LEFT THE HOUSE I SET MYSELF TO MAKING A LITTLE MODEL OF WAX IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW THE JEWEL WOULD LOOK WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED
NOW HE IS SATISFIED WITH GOING ABOUT AND TALKING BIG AND THINKS I AM AFRAID OF HIM
SO I RETURNED WITH A BLITHE HEART TO FINISH MY PERSEUS
FOR ONE LIKE HIM I LEARNED BUT NOW WHOD CRY TO ME AS BY BETHESDAS SHORE
THE FIRST WHICH COMES TO HAND IS THIS
ONLY LISTEN TO THE NOISE THEYRE MAKING
THERE I SOUGHT OUT MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI CLERK OF THE CAMERA AND BASTIANO VENEZIANO THE PAINTER
AND TELL HIM FROM ME TO JOIN MY SERVICE AND THAT I WILL FIND WORK ENOUGH BY THE DAY FOR HIM TO DO IN HIS OTHER TRADE. THEN STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND HE GAVE HIM A HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS OF THE CAMERA IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID
IF LOVE STILL SWAY THE BLEST LOOK DOWN ON HIM THOU HERE DIDST LOVE AND VIEW THESE TEARS THAT MOURN MY LOSS NOT THY GREAT GOOD
I HAVE IN ROME A SHOP OPEN WITH JOURNEYMEN AND A PRETTY BUSINESS
I EXPLAINED ALL THE DEVICES I HAD USED IN FIRING
MEANWHILE I COMPLETED MY WORK IN A STYLE WHICH DID ME THE GREATEST CREDIT
I HAD REACHED THE END OF THE STREET AND WAS MAKING TOWARD THE PALACE WHEN MY HABIT BEING ALWAYS TO TURN THE CORNERS WIDE I OBSERVED THE CORSICAN GET UP AND TAKE HIS STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
ALL THE SAME WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I ALSO DESCENDED FROM THE FORTRESS AT THAT VERY SPOT. IN SO SAYING THE POPE SPOKE THE TRUTH
SOLLEVATI IT MAY MEAN HALF-RISEN FROM THEIR SEATS NOTE 2
WE TOLD HIM FREQUENTLY THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO GO TO HIM
MY DRAWING AND MY FINE STUDIES IN MY CRAFT AND MY CHARMING ART OF MUSIC ALL WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THE DIN OF THAT ARTILLERY
ON THE CONTRARY I HELD THE CARDINAL FOR MY VERY GOOD PATRON
2 THIS ANIMAL THEN REFERRED TO MADAME DETAMPES FOR ADVICE UPON THE MATTER AND SHE ORDERED HIM TO SUMMON GIROLAMO BELLARMATO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME
FOR IF YOU HAD TAKEN THE VALUE OF A WHOLE TIARA I AM QUITE READY TO PARDON YOU. THEREUPON I ANSWERED
HE WAS SO PUT OUT BY THE WORDS HIS MASTER FLUNG AT HIM THAT HE SAID HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME OR KNOW WHO I WAS
FOR THOUGH THEY ARE CALLED ANGELS HERE SHALL YE SEE THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THE MALE GENDER. THEN WITH A LOUD VOICE HE ADDED
BUT NOW THAT GOD HAS OVERRULED THE MALIGN INFLUENCES OF THE STARS AND SAVED ME FOR YOUR HOLINESS I HUMBLY BEG YOU ANOTHER TIME NOT TO LET YOURSELF SO EASILY BE STIRRED TO RAGE AGAINST ME. THE POPE HAD STOPPED FROM LOOKING AT THE MEDALS AND WAS NOW LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO WHAT I SAID
WHILE THIS DEBATE WAS BEING CARRIED ON I WENT TO BARGAIN FOR THREE HORSES WHICH I WANTED ON MY TRAVELS
THE SOONER I ESCAPE FROM THIS EARTHLY PRISON THE HAPPIER SHALL I BE
STILL I BORE IT GREATLY AGAINST THE GRAIN AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE REFLECTING THAT I COULD HARDLY FIND SO SUITABLE A SUBJECT FOR MY ART AS SHE WAS
BENVENUTO YOU HAVE ONLY TO GIVE A LITTLE SURFACE TO YOUR STATUE. THEN HE TURNED TO HIS ATTENDANTS PRAISING MY PERFORMANCE AND SAYING
THAT ACCURSED WOMAN SEEMED BORN TO BE THE RUIN OF THE WORLD
WELL CONSIDERING THE SORES ARE SO NEW AND HAVE NOT YET BEGUN TO STINK AND THAT THE REMEDIES WILL BE TAKEN IN TIME YOU NEED NOT BE TOO MUCH AFRAID FOR I HAVE GOOD HOPES OF CURING YOU. WHEN HE HAD PRESCRIBED FOR ME AND GONE AWAY A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE CALLED GIOVANNI RIGOGLI CAME IN WHO FELL TO COMMISERATING MY GREAT SUFFERING AND ALSO MY DESERTION BY MY COMRADE AND SAID
IT HAPPENED TO JUT OUT SCARCELY FOUR FINGERS
SBIETTA RECEIVED ME IN HIS OWN HOUSE WITH SUCH ATTENTIONS AND SUCH HONOURS AS A DUKE MIGHT COVET
3 THUS I FLUNG OFF IN A PASSION TELLING HIM THAT I WOULD SOON SHOW HIM THAT I SPOKE TRUTH
BUT MESSER ANTONIO ALSO SENT ME FOOD
I SAID NO! THEN SHE ADDED
THE MIRROR WAS IN THE FORM OF A WHEEL
AND THE AIR BLAZED WITH LIGHTNINGS GOETHE TAKES IT AS I DO ABOVE
THIS FRIAR KEPT PERPETUALLY REMINDING ME THAT I WAS IN NO WISE BOUND TO OBSERVE FAITH WITH THE CASTELLAN SINCE I HAD BECOME A PRISONER
DURING THIS I SAID TO MY YOUNG MEN
SEE THAT YOU PUT THESE LINES EACH DAY WHERE I CAN SEE THEM
FAREWELL! I TURNED MY HORSE AND LEFT THEM WEEPING
LOCK ME WELL UP AND KEEP GOOD WATCH ON ME
MAESTRO GIACOPO SAID I WAS IN FLORENCE
HE AFFECTED TO PAY LITTLE ATTENTION
HAVING MADE THIS ESTIMATE AND PUT ALL THINGS IN ORDER I LOOKED OUT A PAIR OF PINCERS WHICH I HAD ABSTRACTED FROM A SAVOYARD BELONGING TO THE GUARD OF THE CASTLE
THEN HE DEPARTED SAYING
I BEGAN IT IN WAX
I TOLD HIM THAT THE ONE WHO HAD BORNE THE CROSS DESERVED THE RECOMPENSE
AND I AM THIS MAN. THEN WE EACH OF US DREW OUR SWORDS WITH SPIRIT
AT THE MOMENT OF MY ARRIVAL I COULD HEAR THAT HE AND HER MOTHER WERE TALKING ABOUT ME
THEN THE BOY TOLD US AGAIN THAT BUT FEW REMAINED AND THOSE WERE AT A DISTANCE
DURING HIS ABSENCE HE WISHED ME TO MAKE A MODEL FOR THAT FAIR FOUNTAIN OF HIS IN THE RICHEST STYLE I COULD INVENT SEEING HE DELIGHTED IN THAT RESIDENCE MORE THAN IN ANYTHING ELSE IN HIS WHOLE REALM
THE HORRIBLE AFFRONT HALF MADDENED ME WITH FURY
THE MAJORDOMO ANSWERED
BENVENUTO I AM ACTING FOR YOUR WELFARE
BUT WE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT HIM THE CASTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
THERE WE TOOK UP QUARTERS AND AT NIGHTFALL THERE ARRIVED A FLORENTINE COURIER NAMED BUSBACCA
WHILE I WAS UTTERING THESE WORDS THE KING KEPT GAZING INTENTLY ON THE VASES AND FROM TIME TO TIME SHOT A TERRIBLE GLANCE AT ME
SEE THAT HE OBTAINS THE SAME SALARY AS THE REST OF YOU
AND WHEN PIERO WAS BANISHED HE ENTRUSTED HIM WITH MANY AFFAIRS OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE
YET BEING NOWADAYS BUT NEEDY BANKRUPT POTENTATES WE WILL AT ANY RATE GIVE HIM BREAD ENOUGH TO SATISFY HIS MODEST WISHES. I LET THE POPE RUN ON TO THE END OF HIS RHODOMONTADE 3 AND THEN ASKED HIM FOR A MACE-BEARERS PLACE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE VACANT
THEREUPON I RECOVERED COMMAND OF MY FACULTIES AND THANKED GOD THAT HIS GOODNESS HAD WITHHELD ME FROM SO GREAT AN ACT OF VIOLENCE
LXXXIV FOUR DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN I WAS ATTACKED WITH VIOLENT FEVER ATTENDED BY EXTREME COLD
ON PERCEIVING THAT THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH MY WORK AND BEING COMMISSIONED TO EXECUTE THE JUPITER IN SILVER OF THE HEIGHT ABOVE DESCRIBED I INTRODUCED THE TWO YOUNG MEN AND SAID THAT I HAD BROUGHT THEM WITH ME OUT OF ITALY TO SERVE HIS MAJESTY
THIS PASSED ON THE DAY OF CORPUS DOMINI 1539
I BELIEVE THAT DEVIL WILL SACK PARIS ONE OF THESE DAYS. THE KING ANSWERED WITH SOME ANGER THAT I WAS ONLY QUITE RIGHT TO DEFEND MYSELF FROM THE LOW RABBLE WHO PUT OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF MY SERVING HIM
HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT SAYING THAT HIS MAJESTY HAD SO ORDERED
THEREFORE MY POWERFUL PRINCE SEEING HOW THE MEN TO WHOSE CARE THAT WORK WAS ENTRUSTED IN THEIR WANT OF TASTE AND WISDOM TOOK MICHEL AGNOLOS MARBLE AWAY FROM HIM AND GAVE IT TO BANDINELLO WHO SPOILT IT IN THE WAY THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS OH
THE ENCOUNTER WAS SOON OVER
IF THEN I LIKED TO RETURN TO FRANCE AND OCCUPY MY CASTLE SHE WOULD SUPPLY ME WITH ALL THE CONVENIENCES I COULD ASK FOR PROVIDED ONLY I CARED TO ENTER HER SERVICE
DEAR GOSSIP I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO INJURE THAT POOR GIRL
THIS INCIDENT WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT I THOUGHT IT WELL TO RELATE IT BEFORE FINISHING THE HISTORY OF THINGS OUTSIDE MY ART THE WHICH IS THE REAL OBJECT OF MY WRITING
SO I WENT TO FIND MESSER AMBRUOGIO WHO HAD HEARD THE WHOLE OF THE AFFAIR OF THE BARGELLO AND HAD BEEN IN CONCERT WITH MY ENEMIES TO BRING ME BACK TO ROME AND HAD SCOLDED THE BARGELLO FOR NOT LAYING HANDS ON ME
BUT BECOMING AWARE OF MY MISDOING I OPENED THEM WIDE AND GAZING STEADFASTLY AT THE SUN EXCLAIMED
TO ALL APPEARANCES HE HAS BROKEN A LEG AND WE DONT KNOW WHETHER HE IS GOING. THE CARDINAL EXCLAIMED AT ONCE
NO SOONER DO THEY OBSERVE THAT THEY ARE GETTING SOME ADVANTAGE IN THE SUIT THAN THEY FIND THE MEANS TO SELL IT
IN THIS WAY WE PASSED THE FIRST FOUR HOURS OF THE NIGHT
THIS MAN WHO TELLS HERE THE STORY OF HIS LIFE WAS A MURDERER AND A BRAGGART INSOLENT SENSUAL INORDINATELY PROUD AND PASSIONATE
ONE DAY HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY HANDED ME SEVERAL POUNDS WEIGHT OF SILVER AND SAID
THE SORE WAS STILL OPEN WITH A PLUG OF LINT INSIDE IT AND A PLASTER ABOVE WHEN I WENT OUT RIDING ON A LITTLE WILD PONY
THE CASTELLAN OUT OF HIS MIND AS HE WAS HAD HIMSELF CARRIED TO THE POPE
THE KING WILL NEVER FIND HIS EQUAL AND OUR CARDINAL WANTS TO CHEAPEN HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE A LOAD OF WOOD. THIS WAS MESSER LUIGI ALAMANNI WHO SPOKE TO THE ABOVE EFFECT AS I WAS AFTERWARDS INFORMED
I BOWED WITH EVERY PROTESTATION OF HUMILITY
AND UPON THIS THEY AGREED
AND WHEN THEY HAD MINUTELY RELATED THE WHOLE MATTER HE MADE AT FIRST AS THOUGH HE WOULD GIVE WAY TO PASSION BUT AFTERWARDS HE PUT CONTROL UPON HIMSELF AND LAUGHED BECAUSE THERE WERE THEN IN THE PRESENCE CERTAIN LORDS AND CARDINALS MY FRIENDS WHO HAD WARMLY ESPOUSED MY CAUSE
YOUR VICTUALS COLD ARE BROUGHT WITH SORRY NEWS BY SOME BASE GROOM OF PRATO-SOLDIER NOW-DRUGGIST OF OLD
OH MY DEAR SON THE PLAGUE IN THIS TOWN IS RAGING WITH IMMITIGABLE VIOLENCE AND I AM ALWAYS FANCYING YOU WILL COME HOME INFECTED WITH IT
THE PRIEST ONE EVENING MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND BADE ME FIND A COMRADE OR NOT MORE THAN TWO
CECCHINO HOWEVER EXPLAINED MATTERS AND BUSIED HIMSELF IN HELPING THE SWOONING WOMAN WHO SOON COME TO
THESE TWO PIECES OF WORK ON WHICH I HAD SPENT UPWARDS OF TWO MONTHS BROUGHT ME IN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS
BUT FOR YOUR SAKE I SHOULD BE SORRY IF THROUGH HER YOU COME TO BREAK YOUR NECK. UPON THESE WORDS HE VOWED AND PRAYED TO GOD THAT IF EVER HE BUT SPOKE WITH HER HE MIGHT UPON THE MOMENT BREAK HIS NECK
BUT TO BLAB ABOUT MY NEIGHBOURS PRIVATE MATTERS,--NEVER
ON APPLYING TO MEN OF LEARNING THEY TOLD ME THAT THESE RINGS WERE WORN AS AMULETS BY FOLK DESIROUS OF ABIDING WITH MIND UNSHAKEN IN ANY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE WHETHER OF GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNE
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT IF I WERE TO COME WITH MY MEDICINE I COULD BLOW BREATH UP THROUGH HIS GUTS 4 AND BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE FOR YOU? BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT THE POOR YOUNG FELLOW WAS GOING AWAY WEEPING HE CALLED HIM BACK AND GAVE HIM AN OIL WITH WHICH TO ANOINT MY PULSES AND MY HEART TELLING HIM TO PINCH MY LITTLE FINGERS AND TOES VERY TIGHTLY AND TO SEND AT ONCE TO CALL HIM IF I SHOULD REVIVE
THE WORK WAS EXECUTED IN WHITE STUCCO ON A BLACK STONE
IT IS MY BUSINESS TO REMAIN NEUTRAL AND NOTHING ELSE. I WAS RETIRING AS QUICKLY AS I COULD WHEN THE POPE HIMSELF CALLED ME BACK
THEN THE POPE ASKED HIM IF HE FELT EQUAL TO PRODUCING A PIECE IN THAT STYLE
AT THAT TIME I FASHIONED A SILVER HEARTS-KEY CHIAVAQUORE AS IT WAS THEN SO CALLED
ONLY IF I WOULD NOT HARBOUR HER SON I MIGHT SQUARE ACCOUNTS BY PAYING HER A HUNDRED CROWNS
THIS CALCULATION IS THE VERY LOWEST
THIS MAN WAS THE SON OF A PEASANT AT TERRANUOVA IN VALDARNO
I BADE HIM BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR THAT I WAS BENT ON LEARNING AND HOPED BY MY ACQUIREMENTS TO BRING HIM BACK BOTH PROFIT AND HONOUR BEFORE LONG
AMONG THE MIGHTY DEAD HE HAD NO PEERS NOR SHALL EARTH SEE HIS LIKE IN MY BELIEF
THEY HAD FOR NEIGHBOUR IN THE NEXT HOUSE A MAN CALLED STEFANO GRANACCI WHO HAD SEVERAL DAUGHTERS ALL OF THEM OF REMARKABLE BEAUTY
BUT I SOON PERCEIVED THAT THE AMBASSADOR HAD COUNTERMINED ME
IN GODS TRUTH I TELL THEE THOU THAT MAKEST IT THY BUSINESS TO HOLD NO MAN IN REGARD THAT WERE IT NOT FOR DECENCY AND ORDER I WOULD HAVE THEE CHUCKED TOGETHER WITH THY WORK THERE OUT OF WINDOWS. ACCORDINGLY WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE POPE HAD BECOME NO BETTER THAN A VICIOUS BEAST MY CHIEF ANXIETY WAS HOW I COULD MANAGE TO WITHDRAW FROM HIS PRESENCE
VII
BENVENUTO I FORBID YOU TO SPEAK
AND WE ALL SAT DOWN AND SUPPED TOGETHER WITH MIRTH AND GLADNESS LAUGHING OVER THOSE GREAT BLOWS WHICH FORTUNE STRIKES FOR GOOD AS WELL AS EVIL AND WHICH WHAT TIME THEY DO NOT HIT THE MARK ARE JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT HAPPENED
AND OFTENTIMES WE CAME HOME LADEN WITH A CARGO OF THE FATTEST PIGEONS
AND HE PROMISED TO DO SO WHEN THE FIRST FLUSH OF MY FAVOUR WITH THE POPE HAD PASSED AWAY
IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE HAPPENED TO MENTION MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI LED THERETO BY A DRAWING I HAD MADE FROM A CARTOON OF THAT DIVINEST PAINTER
QUICK QUICK BRING THE VASE. I WHO WANTED TO ACT AT LEISURE AND NOT TO GIVE UP TO HIM SAID THAT I DID NOT MEAN TO BE SO QUICK
SINCE MY STARS HAD SENTENCED ME TO DIE I THOUGHT IT NO BAD BARGAIN TO ESCAPE FROM LIFE SO EASILY
SO I BLUSHED AND SAID
PARTICINO THE WOOD-CARVER HAD THE GATE OF SANTO NICCOLò
BENINTENDI RETORTED IT WAS IDIOTIC NONSENSE ADDING POX TAKE THEM, AND OTHER PRETTY FLOWERS OF SPEECH
HE PAID ME VERY BADLY
PAULINO WAS THE BEST-MANNERED THE MOST HONEST AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOY I EVER SAW IN MY WHOLE LIFE
THEN UPON ENTERING HIS PRESENCE I KISSED HIS KNEE AND HE RECEIVED ME VERY GRACIOUSLY
MESSER TRAIANO ALICORNO
IN ORDER THEN TO GAIN MY SECRET THE FRIAR NOW MADE LIGHT OF THESE ASSERTIONS AVERRING THAT PERSONS WHO HAVE GAINED SOME CREDIT BY THEIR ABILITIES ARE WONT TO TALK BIG OF THINGS WHICH IF THEY HAD TO PUT THEIR BOASTS IN ACTION WOULD SPEEDILY DISCREDIT THEM AND MUCH TO THEIR DISHONOUR
THEREFORE HE MUST CERTAINLY ARRANGE FOR COMMITTING ME TO SOME ONE WHO WOULD APPRECIATE ME BETTER BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO RUN A FARTHER RISK OF LOSING ME
5 THIS MAN SAID
SEVERAL ITALIAN NOBLEMEN TO WIT SIGNOR PIERO STROZZI THE COUNT OF ANGUILLARA THE COUNT OF PITIGLIANO THE COUNT OF MIRANDOLA AND MANY OTHERS GAVE ME EMPLOYMENT ALSO
FRATE ALESSIO DISGUISED ME LIKE A FRIAR AND GAVE ME A LAY BROTHER TO GO WITH ME
PRAY ASSIST THE PURCHASE
THE MULE WAS TROTTING VERY QUICKLY AND THE MAN WAS TALKING TO THE SOLDIERS IN THE TRENCHES
BUT WHILE INDULGING SUCH DESIRES I MADE NO SHOW OF THEM
I AM ONLY AFRAID THAT WE SHALL NEVER SEE IT FINISHED
MY LORD A FAITHFUL SERVANT OF HIS PRINCE WHO TRIES TO ACT RIGHTLY AND IS WILLING TO PUT UP WITH ANY SORT OF BAD TREATMENT PROVIDED ONLY THAT POOR LADY HAVE HER HEARTS DESIRE! THE DUKE TIRED OF THE RIBALD FELLOW EITHER TO RECOMPENSE THE CUFFS WHICH HE HAD DEALT HIM OR FOR THE DUCHESS SAKE WHOM HE WAS EVER MOST INCLINED TO GRATIFY CRIED OUT
THE ONE THING OF THE KIND WHICH OCCURS TO ME IS THIS
VASARI CALLS THIS EMINENT ENGRAVER OF GEMS MICHELINO
THEN I WROTE TO MY OLD FATHER TELLING HIM THE NEWS WHICH SO AFFECTED HIM WITH EXTREME JOY THAT A SUDDEN FIT OF ILLNESS TOOK HIM AND WELL-NIGH BROUGHT HIM TO DEATHS DOOR
3 THIS I BEGAN
AND WHILE I WAS ENGAGED IN DRAWING AND MODELLING THAT MIRACLE WHICH I HAD SEEN UPON THE MORNING OF ALL SAINTS DAY HE SENT HIS NEPHEW PIERO UGOLINI TO SHOW ME CERTAIN JEWELS
OFTEN THEN THOSE SOLDIERS TOLD ME THAT I OUGHT TO ESCAPE AND THAT THEY WOULD AID AND ABET ME KNOWING AS THEY DID HOW GREATLY I HAD BEEN WRONGED
TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS I SHOT A WILD PIGEON IN A CLEFT HIGH UP BEHIND THE PALACE
SO THE VASE CAME ONCE MORE INTO MY HANDS AND I PROMISED TO PUT IT FORTHWITH IN ORDER WHICH INDEED I DID
THEREFORE WHATEVER HE LOOKS AT BE THE THING SUPERLATIVELY EXCELLENT BECOMES IN HIS UNGRACIOUS EYES AS BAD AS CAN BE
AND PLAY ME NO MORE OF YOUR GAMES I BEG
WE OFTEN HELD SUCH CONVERSATIONS
BENVENUTO DO NOT MIND YOUR STATUE HAVING BEEN UNCOVERED BECAUSE THESE MEN ARE ONLY WORKING AGAINST THEMSELVES
I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD THE GREATEST WISH TO OBLIGE MY LORD AS HIS AFFECTIONATE AND FAITHFUL SERVANT BUT THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ARTS OF FLATTERY
INDEED I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY DAYS IN THAT GREAT SUFFERING
BUT I HAD ALREADY JUMPED TO MY FEET
AND TURNING TO ONE OF HIS JOURNEYMEN A FLORENTINE CALLED GIANNOTTO GIANNOTTI WHO HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS WITH HIM HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
I STABBED HIM IN THE BREAST PIERCING DOUBLET AND JERKIN THROUGH AND THROUGH TO THE SHIRT WITHOUT HOWEVER GRAZING HIS FLESH OR DOING HIM THE LEAST HARM IN THE WORLD
I BEGAN TO LAUGH AND SAID THAT GOD HAD PROTECTED THEM ALREADY FOR THAT I WAS A MAN TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST WHOEVER TRIED TO DO THEM HARM
YOUR EXCELLENCY CAN FIND MULTITUDES OF MEN WHO ARE ABLE TO BUILD YOU CITIES AND PALACES BUT YOU WILL NOT PERHAPS FIND ONE MAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE A SECOND PERSEUS. THEN I TOOK MY LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING OR DOING ANYTHING FARTHER
NOW IM BECOME FINE GOLD SUCH GOLD AS NONE FLINGS LIGHTLY TO THE WIND FIT FOR THE BEST WORK EYES SHALL EER BEHOLD
THEN HE CALLED ME INTO HIS CHAMBER AND ASKED ME HOW MUCH GOLD WAS WANTED FOR THE SALT-CELLAR
ACCORDINGLY I WENT BACK TO THE INN AND CALLED OUR HOST WHO TOLD ME HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH US AND THAT WE MIGHT GO TO JERICHO
AND AFTER WE HAD TALKED AWHILE ABOUT SUCH MATTERS HE ASKED IF I HAD ANYTHING WORTH SEEING AT MY HOUSE AND NEXT INQUIRED WHEN I SHOULD LIKE HIM TO COME
THE SERVICE OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY BRINGS ME BACK ELSE I SHOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE STAYED SOME FEW DAYS LONGER ON MY JOURNEY THROUGH THAT LOVELY COUNTRY. WELL AND WHAT GOOD NEWS HAVE YOU? SAID HE
AND HE FANCIED THAT MINE WOULD BE FOUR OR FIVE CROWNS DI MONETA 1 I FOR MY PART STUNNED AND STIFLED BY HIS CRIES AND BY THE LOOKS AND SMILES OF THE BYSTANDERS FIRST PEEPED INTO MY PACKET
ON ONE SIDE I WORKED LITTLE FAWNS IN HALF RELIEF WITH SOME WILD BOARS AND OTHER GAME IN LOWER RELIEF
I TOOK HIM UP SOMEWHAT SHARPLY WITH THESE WORDS
IN 1532 WHEN HE CHANGED THE FLORENTINE CONSTITUTION
LET BENVENUTO GET HIS GRACE WITHOUT THE PRISON AND SEE THAT HIS MOTO PROPRIO IS MADE OUT IN DUE FORM. AS SOON AS THE DOCUMENT HAD BEEN DRAWN UP HIS HOLINESS SIGNED IT
WHY HE EFFECTED NO DIVERSION WHILE THE IMPERIAL TROOPS WERE MARCHING UPON ROME AND WHY HE DELAYED TO RELIEVE THE CITY WAS NEVER PROPERLY EXPLAINED
SO HE BEGAN IN THIS WISE
HE DIED AT FLORENCE MAY 13 1571 AND WAS BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF THE ANNUNZIATA IN THAT CITY
HE HAD REFUSED TO LEAVE THE PALACE OF ST PETER EARLIER BEING UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT HIS ENEMIES WOULD EFFECT THEIR ENTRANCE INTO ROME
CXX THE GOOD CASTELLAN USED FREQUENTLY TO SEND MESSENGERS TO FIND OUT SECRETLY WHAT I WAS DOING
AMONG MANY BRONZE MEDALS I OBTAINED ONE UPON WHICH WAS A HEAD OF JUPITER
WHEN HE HAD INSPECTED THEM WITH MINUTE ATTENTION HE UTTERED THESE SPIRITED WORDS WHICH CLOTHED MY SOUL WITH A FALSE HOPE
BUT THE GATES OF ROME WERE NOT YET SHUT
I AM COME TO DO TO YOU THAT WHICH YOU DID TO ME SO MANY MONTHS AGO. HE BURST OUT LAUGHING EMBRACED AND KISSED ME AND BEGGED ME FOR THE COUNTS SAKE TO KEEP QUIET
ON BEHOLDING IT MESSER GABRIEL CESANO WAS THE FIRST TO LIFT HIS VOICE UP AND TO CRY
295
I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY SHE URGED ME SO PERSISTENTLY TO EAT
AFTER WATCHING US AT WORK A WHILE SHE TURNED TO ME WITH THE UTMOST GRACIOUSNESS AND SHOWED ME A NECKLACE OF LARGE AND REALLY VERY FINE PEARLS
I COULD HARDLY STIR BECAUSE OF MY BROKEN LEG
1 THERE WAS A RAGGED STABLE-BOY ABOUT HALF A SLEEP WHO CRIED OUT TO ME
HE ALSO TRIED TO PERSUADE ME TO ASSIST HIM IN CONSECRATING A BOOK BY MEANS OF WHICH WE SHOULD EXTRACT IMMEASURABLE WEALTH SINCE WE COULD CALL UP FIENDS TO SHOW US WHERE TREASURES WERE WHEREOF THE EARTH IS FULL
IT WAS THE VERY MAN WHO HAD SO INCONSIDERATELY TOLD MY FATHER HE MEANT TO MARCH ME OUT INTO THE COUNTRY WITH THE LANCES
NOBODY CAN TELL HOW HIS TWO LEGS ARE ATTACHED TO THAT VILE TRUNK
WHERE IS THAT ONION-STEW OF YOURS
INDEED I WOULD GLADLY HAVE PAID FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS DOWN TO HAVE AVOIDED THAT APPEARANCE IN COURT
XLIII ALL THIS WHILE I WAS ENGAGED IN PUTTING MY DOOR TOGETHER WITH ITS SEVERAL APPURTENANCES
2 HER REAL NAME WAS JEANNE
GIACOMO RASTELLI WAS A NATIVE OF RIMINI BUT WAS POPULARLY KNOWN AS OF PERUGIA SINCE HE HAD RESIDED LONG IN THAT CITY
HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD FIND THINGS OF GREATER BEAUTY AND NOT LESS EXCELLENT THERE
AMONG THEM WAS MAESTRO JACOMO OF PERUGIA A MOST EXCELLENT AND ABLE SURGEON
THEN WE WILL STAY IN IT WITHOUT THEM UNLESS MY MANHOOD HAS DESERTED ME. I PUT SPURS TO MY HORSE AND WHEN I WAS WITHIN FIFTY PACES DISMOUNTED AND MARCHED BOLDLY FORWARD WITH MY PIKE
AND SINCE IT TOOK HIM SEVERAL HOURS I FINISHED A GOOD PIECE OF MY NEPTUNES HEAD
YOU THEN WILL HEAR WHAT THE SCHOOL THINKS
IN THE LUNETTE ABOVE I PLACED A FEMALE FIGURE LYING IN AN ATTITUDE OF NOBLE GRACE
INDEED HE HAD ALREADY BEEN INFORMED THAT THE POPE GREATLY REGRETTED HAVING LET ME GO
AND WE WHO WERE POUNDED BLACK AND BLUE SCRAMBLED AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON OUR HORSES
IN TRUTH HAD I BELIEVED HIM TO BE SO UTTERLY FEEBLE I SHOULD NOT HAVE CONCEIVED THE NOTION OF BRANDING HIM WITH SUCH INFAMY AS I AM GOING TO RELATE
ERCOLE GONZAGA CREATED CARDINAL IN 1527
I SHALL LEAVE ORDERS WITH MY FACTOR TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU MAY WANT. HE THEN DEPARTED AND I REMAINED SORELY DISSATISFIED AND MORE THAN ONCE I WAS UPON THE POINT OF TAKING MYSELF OFF WITHOUT LICENSE
THIS FURNISHED THEM WITH MATTER FOR REJOICING AND ME WITH SATISFACTION
IN THIS WAY MY GUN AT THE END OF THE GAME STOOD ME MORE IN PROFIT THAN IN LOSS
WE LAY ONE NIGHT AT A PLACE ON THIS SIDE CHIOGGIA ON THE LEFT HAND AS YOU GO TOWARD FERRARA
THE LIFE OF HIMSELF WHICH CELLINI WROTE WAS DUE TO OTHER MOTIVES THAN THOSE WHICH PRODUCED ITS CHIEF COMPETITORS FOR FIRST PLACE IN ITS CLASS
HERE IT IS TIED JUST AS I ARRANGED IT BEFORE I LEFT MY HOUSE. MY GOSSIP DEEMED THAT I HAD BEEN A BAD TRAVELLING COMPANION TO HIM BECAUSE I RESENTED AFFRONTS AND DEFENDED MYSELF AGAINST FOLK WHO WOULD HAVE DONE US INJURY
IF GOD AND MY GOOD CAUSE TOGETHER WITH MY OWN STRENGTH OF BODY AND MIND POSSESS THE WILL AND THE POWER YOU SHALL NOT MAKE ME ABLE TO HAVE WHAT YOU SAY. SO SAYING I LEAPT INTO THE BOAT AND TURNING MY PIKES POINT AGAINST THEM ADDED
THE OTHER GUIDE REFUSED TO TROUBLE HIMSELF BY RENDERING ANY ASSISTANCE
THAT RASCAL THE PRIEST HIS BROTHER ENTERED INTO SIMILAR ENGAGEMENTS
ON REFLECTION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TOO MUCH METAL FLOWED INTO YOU MOULD
THE GUN WAS AN ARQUEBUSO A RUOLA WHICH HAD A WHEEL TO COCK IT
AND THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS MY PROPER RECOMPENSE FOR SUCH A MASTERPIECE BUT ONLY AS A KIND OF GRATUITY
CONSEQUENTLY THEY COULD BY NO MEANS ALLOW THE POPES PLAN TO BE CARRIED OUT
THE CARDINAL HOWEVER HAD BEEN WARNED AND PRESENTLY WITHDREW
GIANGIACOMO REPLIED
INDEED I REASONED THAT IF I COULD ESCAPE IMPRISONMENT AND LET THE STORM PASS OVER I SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN MATTERS TO THE KING BY LETTER SETTING FORTH THE TRAP WHICH HAD BEEN LAID TO RUIN ME BY THE MALICE OF MY ENEMIES
AT THIS I RAISED MY HANDS TO HEAVEN EXCLAIMING
IN RETURN HE BESTOWED UPON THE CARDINAL AN ABBEY WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND CROWNS A YEAR AND EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REWARDING ME TOO
HE LEFT ROME APRIL 1 1537
THESE LETTERS OF NATURALISATION TOGETHER WITH THE PATENT FOR THE CASTLE I BROUGHT WITH ME WHEN I RETURNED TO ITALY
THEY EXPECTED HIM TO BE EXTREMELY GRATIFIED WITH THEIR COMMUNICATION BUT IT TURNED OUT JUST THE CONTRARY
HE FOUGHT BRAVELY FOR FLORENCE IN THE SIEGE
I HAVE COME TO FLORENCE TO ENLIST AS MANY YOUNG MEN AS I CAN
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID IN ITALIAN
THE MAJORDOMO WAS HER CRONY AND I MIGHT REST ASSURED THAT SHE COULD WORK HIM TO HER LIKING PROVIDED I PAID DOWN THE HUNDRED CROWNS
THIS WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE COLOSSUS ABOVE P
I SWEAR BY THE SACRAMENTS WHICH I CARRY ON MY PERSON FOR I WAS CONSECRATED BISHOP TWO DAYS SINCE THAT THE POPE HAS SET YOU FREE AND PARDONED YOU AND IS VERY SORRY FOR YOUR ACCIDENT
1 THIS ABLE MAN IN THE COURSE OF HIS OTHER PRACTICE UNDERTOOK THE MOST DESPERATE CASES OF THE SO-CALLED FRENCH DISEASE
THEN HE SAID TO PAULINO
AFTER WE HAD EATEN THE SALADS ON SOME COMMON PLATTERS AND THEY WERE PREPARING TO SERVE THE BOILED MEAT EACH GUEST RECEIVED A PORRINGER FOR HIMSELF
MA CHE IO GUARDASSI BENE CHE C THIS IS PERHAPS
THEN MY GOOD FATHER SAID THAT SUCH EXCELLENT PARTS AS I POSSESSED WOULD BE THE GREATEST VENGEANCE I COULD TAKE FOR THE INSULTS OF HIS ENEMIES
LXXIV CARDINAL CORNARO ON HEARING OF THE AFFAIR DESPATCHED THIRTY SOLDIERS WITH AS MANY PARTISANS PIKES AND ARQUEBUSES TO BRING ME WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO HIS QUARTERS
WHEN BOZZA AND PEDIGNONE CAME I ALWAYS TOLD THEM TO GIVE IT A WIDE BERTH SO AS NOT TO DIRTY AND SPOIL IT FOR ME
FRANCESCO MARIA DELLA ROVERE DUKE OF URBINO COMMANDED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AS GENERAL OF THE CHURCH AND WAS NOW ACTING FOR VENICE
I ANSWERED THAT I MEANT TO CARRY THE MONEY MYSELF
AS I HAD NOW FOR MANY YEARS BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE MANNERS OF THE ROMAN COURT I CONCEIVED THAT SOME ONE HAD DONE ME A BAD TURN
I DO NOT BID YOU NOT TO COME NOR DO I BID YOU TO DISOBEY THE DUKE
AND HAVING KISSED ANGELICA WE PARTED SHE WITH TEARS AND I WITH LAUGHTER AND OFF AT ONCE I SET FOR ROME
THEY CAME FROM PONTE VECCHIO THE ONE AN OLD MAN OF SIXTY YEARS THE OTHER A YOUNG FELLOW OF EIGHTEEN
MATTERS BEING THUS ARRANGED I RECEIVED DAILY VISITS AND GENEROUS OFFERS FROM MANY GREAT LORDS AND GENTLEMEN
AH ME
AH ME
AH ME
THEN WHILE MY SHOP WAS BEING OPENED AND SWEPT OUT I PUT MY CAPE ON TO GO ABROAD AND TAKE THE AIR
SO I CARRIED IT HOME AND SENT AT ONCE TO INVITE SEVERAL OF MY BEST FRIENDS
ACCORDINGLY I SET HAND TO IT AND IN TWELVE DAYS I FINISHED IT IN THE FORM OF A FLEUR-DE-LYS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE ORNAMENTING IT WITH LITTLE MASKS CHILDREN AND ANIMALS EXQUISITELY ENAMELLED WHEREBY THE DIAMONDS WHICH FORMED THE LILY WERE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN EFFECT
BUT THE DOCTORS FORBADE IT SAYING THAT I TOOK IF IT WITH THE FEVER ON ME I SHOULD NOT HAVE A WEEK TO LIVE
WHAT PLEASANT AND FRIENDLY TERMS MY BOYS ARE ON WITH YOU! NOTE 1
HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD GRANT ME SOMETHING OF FAR GREATER CONSEQUENCE
THE SUPPER WAS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT CONCERT OF DELIGHTFUL MUSIC VOICES JOINING IN HARMONY WITH INSTRUMENTS
I AIMED SOME SWIVELS AND FALCONETS AT POINTS WHERE I SAW IT WOULD BE USEFUL AND KILLED WITH THEM A GOOD NUMBER OF THE ENEMY
THERE IN THAT LARGE EXTENT OF SPACE IT SHOWED SO BRAVELY THAT BANDINELLO COMING THROUGH THE GARDEN OF THE INNOCENTS TO LOOK AT IT WAS COMPELLED IN SPITE OF HIS EVIL AND MALIGNANT NATURE TO PRAISE IT HE WHO NEVER PRAISED AUGHT OR ANY ONE IN ALL HIS LIFE
I TOLD MESSER BACCIO TO BEG ME FROM THE DUKE
ONLY THAT LUCK WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HIM
AND I WOULD HAVE YOU DO THIS TO-DAY RATHER THAN TO-MORROW. NOTE 1
GO THEN AND MAKE ME A FINE MODEL. HE HAD ALL THE JEWELS SHOWN ME AND THEN I WENT OFF LIKE A SHOT 3 TO SET MYSELF TO WORK
BUT WHEN CARDINAL ORSINI 3 BECAME AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD HE BEGAN TO EXPOSTULATE WITH THE POPE PROTESTING THAT THE THING BY NO MEANS OUGHT TO HAPPEN SEEING THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF CONCLUDING AN ACCOMMODATION AND THAT IF THE GENERALS WERE KILLED THE RABBLE OF THE TROOPS WITHOUT A LEADER WOULD STORM THE CASTLE AND COMPLETE THEIR UTTER RUIN
I CAN GIVE IT FOR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CROWNS
SO I THRUST MY HAND INTO MY PURSE AND PAID THEM ALL TO THEIR FULL SATISFACTION
THE FANCY TOOK ME ON ONE DAY TO WRITE
BUT I ENJOYED THE GREATEST SATISFACTION OF MY CURIOSITY IN SUCH MATTERS
THIS FILLED ME WITH A GLAD ASTONISHMENT AND I EXCLAIMED
THINGS STOOD SO ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE SERVANT ALWAYS SUING FOR HIS WIFES DOWER THE MASTER PUTTING HIM OFF WITH PRETEXTS BUT ASSURING THE WOMAN THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY REVENGE HER FATHERS MURDER
THIS IS THE THIEF WHO BROKE INTO MY SHOP AND ROBBED IT
522
I PUT SPIRIT INTO MY COMRADE RAFFAELLO DA MONTELUPO THE SCULPTOR WHO HAD ALSO LEFT HIS POST AND HID HIMSELF ALL FRIGHTENED IN A CORNER WITHOUT STIRRING FOOT OR FINGER
LUIGI HAVING TALKED OF ME AND OF HIS GREAT OBLIGATIONS TO ME WITH MESSER GIOVANNI THE LATTER EXPRESSED A WISH TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND
AT ANOTHER TO CUT THE THROATS OF FOUR FINE HORSES WHICH HE HAD IN THE STABLE
THIS MESSER LATINO WHO HAD A PRETTY BIG DASH OF THE FOOL IN HIS COMPOSITION BETHOUGHT HIM OF FURNISHING THE POPE WITH A NEW IDEA WHICH WAS HOWEVER WHOLLY OF HIS OWN INVENTION
WHEN HE WAS GONE MY BROTHER LOST BLOOD SO COPIOUSLY FOR NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO STOP IT THAT HE WENT OFF HIS HEAD AND KEPT RAVING ALL THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT ONCE WHEN THEY WANTED TO GIVE HIM THE COMMUNION HE SAID
THEY PLUMED THEMSELVES EXCEEDINGLY WHEN THEY SAW YOUNG MEN OF MY SORT COMING TO STUDY IN THEIR PALACES
I IMPLORED THIS MESSER ANDREA TO ASK THE CARDINAL NOT TO GIVE ME UP TO THE POPE BUT TO LET ME ACT ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
4 NOW WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER
I HAD NOT MEANT TO KILL HIM
CHANCING TO PASS ONE DAY BEFORE MY SHOP HE SAW A LOT OF DRAWINGS WHICH I HAD LAID UPON THE COUNTER AND AMONG THESE WERE SEVERAL DESIGNS FOR LITTLE VASES IN A CAPRICIOUS STYLE WHICH I HAD SKETCHED FOR MY AMUSEMENT
MESSER DURANTE DURANTI PREFECT OF THE CAMERA UNDER PAUL III WHO GAVE HIM THE HAT IN 1544 AND THE BISHOPRIC OF BRESCIA AFTERWARDS
THE ANCIENTS NEVER HAD SUCH MEDALS MADE FOR THEM AS THESE. WHILE HE AND THE OTHERS WERE INSPECTING THEM TAKING UP NOW THE DIES AND NOW THE MEDALS IN THEIR HANDS I BEGAN TO SPEAK AS SUBMISSIVELY AS I WAS ABLE
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU AWARD IT TO THE ONE WHO HAS DESERVED IT YOU WILL ACQUIRE GREAT GLORY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WILL EMPLOY YOUR TREASURE WELL WHILE ARTISTS WILL BELIEVE THAT YOU APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR BUSINESS. NO SOONER HAD I FINISHED SPEAKING THAN THE DUKE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND BEGAN TO MOVE AWAY
AND WHEN THE MAN ARRIVED HE MADE US BOTH APPEAR BEFORE HIM AND COMMISSIONED EACH OF US TO FURNISH A DESIGN FOR MOUNTING AN UNICORNS HORN THE FINEST WHICH HAD EVER BEEN SEEN AND WHICH HAD BEEN SOLD FOR 17,000 DUCATS OF THE CAMERA
DO THEY IMAGINE WHEN THEY HEAP THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FAVOURS ON ME THAT I AM NOT AWARE THEY ARE DONE TO BETRAY ME? THE WORTHY YOUNG MAN ANSWERED
WHEREAS MY INTELLIGENT DOCTOR DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD SUFFER NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE AND WOULD BE VERY WELL ABLE TO USE HER RIGHT HAND
TRAITORS
I NOW BEGAN TO SHOW MYSELF MORE OFTEN THAN I HAD RECENTLY BEEN DOING
THERE HALF HIDDEN HE HEARD EVERYTHING THE FOLK WERE SAYING OF MY STATUE
WHILE I WAS FIRING A CANNON SHOT REACHED ME WHICH HIT THE ANGLE OF A BATTLEMENT AND CARRIED OFF ENOUGH OF IT TO BE THE CAUSE WHY I SUSTAINED NO INJURY
OR DO YOU WANT UPON GOOD FRIDAY TO FORCE US BOTH INTO A SCANDAL? HE ANSWERED THAT GOOD FRIDAY OR THE DEVILS FRIDAY WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM AND THAT IF I DID NOT TAKE MYSELF AWAY HE WOULD FELL ME TO THE GROUND WITH A SPONTOON WHICH HE HAD TAKEN UP--ME AND THE ARQUEBUSE I HAD MY HAND ON
I FOUND THAT THE BLOCK HAD TWO HOLES PENETRATING TO THE DEPTH OF A QUARTER OF A CUBIT AND TWO GOOD INCHES WIDE
THAT BEFORE TWO OR THREE DAYS AT THE LONGEST HAVE PASSED BY YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER DUKE MUCH WORSE PERHAPS THAN HE WHO NOW HAS LEFT YOU. 3 THE FOLLOWING DAY BETTINI CAME TO MY SHOP AND SAID
THE GOOD KING APPEASED HER BY REPLYING THAT THE SOLE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT WAS TO ADMINISTER SUCH A SCOLDING AS SHOULD MAKE ME TREMBLE IN MY SHOES
BUT WHEN I WANTED TO STAND UP I DISCOVERED THAT MY RIGHT LEG WAS BROKEN THREE INCHES ABOVE THE HEEL
AND IN AN INSTANT THE SAME CLEAR AND OPEN VOICE SAID TO ME
THIS AGREEABLE GENTLEMAN OBSERVED ME SO ATTENTIVELY THAT HE MADE ME BASHFUL AND SELF-CONSCIOUS
FOR THOUGH MY MODEL WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED YET THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS EXCELLENCY WOULD ENABLE HIM TO COMPREHEND PERFECTLY HOW IT WAS LIKELY TO LOOK WHEN FINISHED
WHAT REMAINED OF THE OVAL I FILLED IN WITH LUXURIANT ORNAMENTATION
I AM INDEED AWARE OF HAVING PERFORMED FOR HIM FAR MORE THAN I UNDERTOOK
GOING THEN ACCORDING TO HIS WONT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIS DEAR MADAME DETAMPES THIS LADY SAW THAT ALL HER INFLUENCE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIVERT HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE
THESE PROPOSALS HE MADE ON THE PART OF THE QUEEN
I HAD JUST BEEN TOLD THAT HE HAD BOASTED OF THE INSULT WHICH HE FANCIED HE HAD PUT UPON ME
LUCAGNOLO TOOK PART IN THE VALUATION ESTIMATING AND PRAISING IT FAR ABOVE MY OWN OPINION
FOR IT WAS THUS HE ARGUED
PEARLS ARE BUT FISHES BONES WHICH IN THE COURSE OF TIME MUST LOSE THEIR FRESHNESS
I FOUND THEM ALL AT TABLE THE DUKE AND DUCHESS DINING IN A PRIVATE APARTMENT
LXVI IT HAPPENED ONE DAY CLOSE ON THE HOURS OF VESPERS THAT I HAD TO GO AT AN UNUSUAL TIME FOR ME FROM MY HOUSE TO MY WORKSHOP
THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
ACCORDINGLY BETHINKING ME FIRST OF MY OWN SAFETY AND IN THE NEXT PLACE OF MY HONOUR I FILLED MY POCKETS WITH THE JEWELS AND GAVE THE GOLD-PIECE INTO THE CUSTODY OF MY WORKMEN AND THEN DESCENDED BAREFOOT FROM THE BACK-WINDOWS AND WADED AS WELL AS I COULD UNTIL I REACHED MONTE CAVALLO
WITH HIS FINE AND TRULY PRINCELY MANNER HE RECEIVED ME LIFTING HIS RIGHT HAND IN WHICH HE HELD AS SUPERB A PEAR-GRAFT AS COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN
BENVENUTO DO YOUR BEST TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND HAVE NO CONCERN FOR ANYTHING ELSE. A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS I OBTAINED AN AUDIENCE OF THE DUKE WHO RECEIVED ME WITH A KIND OF GRUDGING GRACE AND ASKED ME WHAT I HAD BEEN DOING AT ROME
FOR ON THE INSTANT WHEN HE LEAVES THE PLACE HIS ENEMIES WILL SEND US TO THE DEVIL
THIS LODGING SHE OCCUPIED SOME TIME AND HE USED TO BRING HER FORTH AT WHILES WITH SECRECY AT NIGHT
AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AT ABOUT TEN HE FLUNG THE REST DOWN AND SAID TO ME WHO WAS STANDING AT A DISTANCE
STRIKE SPURS TO YOUR HORSES AND LET US GALLOP TO STAGGIA WITHOUT STOPPING
THEN HE ROSE FROM TABLE AND TURNING TO ME SAID
MAKE OFF
NOTHING IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD OR BY CRAFTSMAN THAT I HAVE SEEN APPROACHED THE DIVINE BEAUTY OF THEIR WORKMANSHIP
AND ASCANIO ALSO BADE ME ENJOY MYSELF WITHOUT UNEASINESS SINCE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE WOULD LET ME KNOW AT ONCE
AND HAVING DONE THE LATTER TO DIEGO THE BOY BLUSHED DEEPLY WHICH IMMENSELY ENHANCED HIS BEAUTY
FOR THESE GOLDSMITHS ONE MUST MAKE DRAWINGS FOR SUCH FINE THINGS AS THAT. I TURNED ROUND UPON HIM IN A MOMENT AND CRIED OUT THAT I DID NOT WANT HIS DRAWINGS FOR MY ART BUT THAT I HOPED BEFORE VERY LONG TO GIVE HIS ART SOME TROUBLE BY MY DRAWINGS
BUT WHEN THE HOUR FOR DINNER WAS ALREADY PAST THEY BETOOK THEMSELVES TO THEIR SEVERAL AFFAIRS AND MY MEAL WAS ALSO SERVED ME
HE BEGAN THUS
SO THEN I BEGAN TO EXHIBIT IT TO EVERY ONE WHO HAD THE MIND TO SEE IT
FOR HE SENT TO ME IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR HOLINESS DEPARTURE AND WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF HE CALLED MY WORK A STEW OF ONIONS AND TOLD ME HE WOULD SEND ME TO COMPLETE IT IN A GALLEY
OUT WITH YOU SHAMEFUL STRUMPET
THE GATES OF JUSTICE HOLY AND AUSTERE WOULD ROLL ASUNDER AND RUDE IMPIOUS RAGE FALL CHAINED WITH SHRIEKS THAT SHOULD ASSAIL THE SKIES
THUS ENDED THAT MOST AGREEABLE SUPPER-PARTY AND EACH OF US RETURNED TO HIS OWN DWELLING AT THE CLOSE OF DAY
IT SAYS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHETHER HIS FEATURES ARE THOSE OF A MAN OR OF SOMETHING BETWEEN A LION AND AN OX
AND FARNESE GETTING WIND OF THE POPES WILL SUMMONED PIETRO CHIAVELLUZI WITH A LOT OF HORSES AND MANAGED TO CORRUPT SOME OF THE CASTLE GUARDS WITH MONEY
YOU HAVE A THOUSAND REASONS ON YOUR SIDE
BENVENUTO WE WILL MAKE YOU ABLE TO HAVE IT. TO WHICH I ANSWERED
AND A LITTLE BEFORE VESPERS I NOTICED SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TRENCH ON MULEBACK
HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HOUSE OF SIGNOR PIER LUIGIS WIFE WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN COMPANY WITH THE DUCHESS OF WHOM I SPOKE ABOVE
IF I HAVE CONSORTED WITH HER AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION I HAVE ONLY DONE THE SAME AS YOU FOLK OF OTHER NATIONS DO. HE DEMURRED
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES
BEHOLD YE OF WHAT SORT ARE THE ANGELS OF PARADISE
THIS THREW HIM INTO MUCH CONCERN AND HE IMPLORED ME AT LEAST TO DESIGN THE REVERSE FOR HIS MEDAL WHICH WAS TO BE A PEGASUS ENCIRCLED WITH A WREATH OF MYRTLE
WHY DONT YOU SPEAK ABOUT MY DESIGN? I RETORTED
IN THE END HOWEVER I SUCCEEDED
NOW MESSER ANTONIO FELT A CERTAIN SHAME FOR HIS BEHAVIOUR
AND I BACKED MY CAUSE WITH THE SAME SPIRIT TILL I GOT MYSELF PAID
WHEN HE HAD DINED I WAS SHOWN INTO A ROOM WHERE I FOUND HIS MAJESTY IN THE COMPANY OF A VERY FEW PERSONS
THE MAN REPLIED GESTICULATING WITH THOSE SPIDERY HANDS OF HIS IN A SHRILL GNATS VOICE
THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA LOOKED ME IN THE FACE AND LET ME UNDERSTAND THAT HE RECOGNISED THE MODEL AS THE SAME WHICH I HAD MADE FOR HIM IN ROME
TRAITORS THIS DAY IS THE DAY ON WHICH I MEAN TO MURDER YOU ALL. FATHER MOTHER AND SISTERS THINKING THE LAST DAY HAD COME THREW THEMSELVES UPON THEIR KNEES SCREAMING OUT FOR MERCY WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
THEY WERE COVERED WITH EARTH AND RUST AND EACH OF THEM LACKED EITHER HEAD OR HANDS OR FEET
E LARIA ERA BIANCHISSIMA PERHAPS THIS OUGHT TO BE
THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY PAYMENT FOR THE DIES AND THE MASTER OF THE MINT BORE ME A GRUDGE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE THEM CHEAPER
IT WAS JUST PAST NOON WHEN SOME OF THE KINGS TREASURERS BY NO MEANS FRIENDS OF MINE MADE A VISIT TO MY CASTLE
AND FINDING THAT I SUCCEEDED TO MY SATISFACTION I EXECUTED SEVERAL PIECES
AT THOSE WORDS FELICE FLUNG HIS ARMS AROUND MY NECK PROTESTING THAT HE WANTED NOTHING BUT TO HAVE ME AS HE WISHED ALIVE WITH HIM
MINIATO WAS NOTARY TO THE FLORENTINE SIGNORIA
JEAN DE MONTLUC BROTHER OF THE CELEBRATED MARSHAL BISHOP OF VALENCE A FRIEND OF MARGARET OF NAVARRE AND LIKE HER A PROTECTOR OF THE HUGUENOTS
JOHN THE BAPTIST TO THE RACK FOR ANY TRIFLING PECCADILLO
THIS STRUCK ME PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF A WORTHY OLD MAN WHO HAS BEEN LIVING FOR MANY YEARS AT VICCHIO AND WHOSE WIFE BAKES BREAD FOR SALE
HE HAS HIT THE MARK BETTER THAN WE DID IN THIS MATTER
I WENT TO SEE MY FARM WHICH PLEASED ME MUCH
THE SERVING-MAN GOT INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT HE MADE AS THOUGH HE WOULD PUT ONE HAND TO HIS SWORD WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE THREATENED TO BREAK THE SHOP OPEN
HAVING ARRANGED IT THUS TO MY MIND I WENT WITH IT TO FOUNTAINEBLEAU WHERE THE KING WAS THEN RESIDING
HE WAS CALLED MAESTRO MILIANO TARGHETTA
I BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN A THOUSAND SONNETS WERE PUT UP IN ABUSE OF THAT DETESTABLE PERFORMANCE
I HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUTTING AWAY THE PROPERTY I COULD NOT CARRY AND FOR CHARGING THE LIGHTER ARTICLES TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY UPON MYSELF AND SERVANTS
HE ESCAPED UNDER PAROLE WHICH HE GAVE ME
FOR THE DUKE AFTER GIVING LATTANZIO GORINI ORDERS TO DISCHARGE THEIR WAGES AT THE END OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS GREW TIRED AND WITHDREW THIS SUBSIDY
SO THEN WHAT I EARNED WITH GODS GRACE AND THE WORLDS SUFFICED ME AND BY COINING FALSE MONEY I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO MUCH
FOR IF YOU GO BACK TO FLORENCE YOU WILL LOSE ALL THAT YOU HAVE GAINED IN FRANCE AND WILL EARN NOTHING THERE BUT ANNOYANCES
HE RECEIVED ME WITH THE HIGHEST MARKS OF HONOUR AND ESTEEM
AND LAUGHING HER WHORISH ARTS TO SCORN I TURNED TO THE BOY IN HER PRESENCE AND SAID THESE WORDS
THERE IS IN FLORENCE AT THIS DAY A MAN WELL ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A STATUE AND WHO IS THEREFORE HIGHLY CAPABLE OF JUDGING IT. HE MEANT BANDINELLO CAVALIERE OF S
THE TIME WAS NOW COME FOR HIM TO SHOW THE PRUDENCE OF A MAN
THERE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FATHER WHO WAS CALLED NICCOLAIO DA VOLTERRA A TRUMPETER OF THE SIGNORY HE SAID O PIERO MY DEAR PUPIL I AM SORELY GRIEVED AT YOUR MISCHANCE
IN REPLY TO THESE LAMENTABLE COMPLAINTS THE DUCHESS SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED
FOR SHE AND THAT CECCHINO BUTI KEPT RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FUSS AND HURRY
I WILL REJOIN YOU IN A FEW MOMENTS. WHILE I WAS PASSING ONWARD DON GARZIA THEN QUITE A LITTLE FELLOW PLUCKED ME BY THE CAPE AND PLAYED WITH ME AS PRETTILY AS SUCH A CHILD COULD DO
HE SAID THEN
AT LAST THEN I RESOLVED ON TAKING THE WOOD AGAINST THE ADVICE OF THE FIRST PHYSICIANS IN ROME
ONLY THE GREAT CENTRAL TOWER EXISTED
3 THROUGH INTERCOURSE TOGETHER SUCH LOVE GREW UP BETWEEN US THAT DAY OR NIGHT WE NEVER STAYED APART
AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO THROW ME DOWN THE OUBLIETTE OF SAMMABO
HE IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO USE MERCURY IN THE CURE OF SYPHILIS A DISEASE WHICH WAS DEVASTATING ITALY AFTER THE YEAR 1495
I OFTENTIMES KEPT SAYING TO HIS EXCELLENCY
FIRST OF ALL THE TWO GOOD OLD MEN AGREED UPON THE MARRIAGE
THE JAIL HAS CRAMMED HIS BRAINS SO FULL OF WIT THEYLL DANCE NO MORRIS TO UPSET THE WIGHT
WHEN WE CAME INTO THE HALL HE WALKING FIRST I FOLLOWING HE SPEAK TO THIS EFFECT
ACCORDINGLY THAT BEAST WENT OFF AND TOOK HIS BAD LUCK WITH HIM
NEVER ONE FRIENDLY WORD
BRING THIS THING HERE
AND THIS WAS ALL I WANTED
REMARKABLE FOR FACILITY AND EXCELLENT IN DESIGN
THE POISON, QUOTH I WORKED SO WELL THAT WHEREAS BEFORE I TOOK IT I HAD PERHAPS BUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO LIVE I VERILY BELIEVE NOW THAT IT HAS HELPED ME TO MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BY BETTERING MY CONSTITUTION
WHEN ONE MORNING THE MAJORDOMO OF HIS OWN ACCORD SENT VERY HUMBLY TO ENTREAT MY PRESENCE AND OPENED A LONG PEDANTIC ORATION IN WHICH I COULD DISCOVER NEITHER METHOD NOR ELEGANCE NOR MEANING NOR HEAD NOR TAIL
AFTER MAKING ITS CLAY TUNIC FOR THAT IS THE TERM USED IN THIS ART AND PROPERLY ARMING IT AND FENCING IT WITH IRON GIRDERS I BEGAN TO DRAW THE WAX OUT BY MEANS OF A SLOW FIRE
WOE IS ME
FOR SOME WHILE AFTERWARDS I DID NOT WORK AT THE NARCISSUS BUT PUSHED MY PERSEUS FORWARD UNDER ALL THE DIFFICULTIES I HAVE DESCRIBED
THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT COMPEL A BLIND MAN TO EXECUTE SUCH THINGS AS THESE. RAISING HIS VOICE STILL HIGHER THE POPE SHOUTED
1 TAKE IT AND MAKE A FINE VASE. NOW I DID NOT CHOOSE TO NEGLECT MY PERSEUS AND AT THE SAME TIME I WISHED TO SERVE THE DUKE SO I ENTRUSTED THE METAL TOGETHER WITH MY DESIGNS AND MODELS IN WAX TO A RASCAL CALLED PIERO DI MARTINO A GOLDSMITH BY TRADE
THEN I ADDED
FOR IN THIS PROFESSION I HOPE TO MAKE HIM THE GREATEST MAN OF THE WORLD IF GOD PROLONGS HIS LIFE. TO THESE WORDS ONE OF THE OLD COUNSELLORS MADE ANSWER
WHEN I HAD STRUCK THESE FOUR SORTS I BEGGED THE DUKE TO MAKE OUT MY APPOINTMENTS AND TO ASSIGN ME THE LODGINGS I HAVE MENTIONED IF HE WAS CONTENTED WITH MY SERVICE
WHEN MAESTRO FRANCESCO SAW THAT THE POISON HAD EXERTED ALL ITS STRENGTH BEING INDEED INSUFFICIENT IN QUANTITY TO OVERCOME MY VIGOROUS CONSTITUTIONS HE SAID ONE DAY
HIS OTHER SON MY BROTHER CECCHINO HAD AS I SAID BEFORE BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE RUDIMENTS OF LATIN LETTERS
WHEN THE MONEY CAME THE POPE GAVE IT TO ME WITH HIS OWN HAND AND BEGGED ME IN THE MOST WINNING TERMS TO LET HIM HAVE IT FINISHED IN HIS OWN DAYS ADDING THAT THIS SHOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
ALL MEN, HE HELD WHATEVER BE THEIR CONDITION WHO HAVE DONE ANYTHING OF MERIT OR WHICH VERILY HAS A SEMBLANCE OF MERIT IF SO BE THEY ARE MEN OF TRUTH AND GOOD REPUTE SHOULD WRITE THE TALE OF THEIR LIFE WITH THEIR OWN HAND. THAT HE HAD DONE MANY THINGS OF MERIT HE HAD NO MANNER OF DOUBT
AND LIKEWISE HONEST MEN WHO POSSESS SOME TALENT EXERCISE IT TO FAR NOBLER PURPORT WHEN THEY HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO LIVE ABUNDANTLY
THUS IT WILL NOT SERVE US IN THIS WORLD TO BE MERELY MEN OF HONESTY AND TALENT
AND POMONA WANTING TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR SILLY TALK TURNED RESTLESSLY UPON HER CHAIR FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER
BUT WHILE EVERY ONE IS NATURALLY BOUND TO FEEL MORE GOODWILL FOR HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN THAN FOR OTHERS STILL ONE OUGHT TO CONSIDER MATURELY WHAT LANGUAGE IT IS RIGHT AND PROPER TO USE WHEN SPEAKING OF A POPE
THEY FOUND ME ON MY KNEES
THE WEAPON PASSED RIGHT THROUGH HIS THROAT
NOTARIES AND WITNESSES ARE COMING
THIS WAS A DELIGHTFUL JOURNEY EXCEPT THAT WHEN WE REACHED PALISSA 1 A BAND OF VENTURERS TRIED TO MURDER US 2 AND IT WAS ONLY BY GREAT COURAGE AND ADDRESS THAT WE GOT FREE FROM THEM
FINDING HIM AT WORK UNHARMED AND WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER THE MESSENGER WENT BACK AND TOLD THE POPE WHO TURNED ROUND TO POMPEO AND SAID
THIS MADE HIS MAJORDOMO NO LESS CONTINUALLY EAGER TO DEVISE SOME TRAP FOR MAKING ME BREAK MY NECK
I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THAT OUR SOCIETY COUNTED GIULIO ROMANO THE PAINTER AND GIAN FRANCESCO BOTH OF THEM CELEBRATED PUPILS OF THE MIGHTY RAFFAELLO DA URBINO
MANY PERSONS OF DIVERS SORTS WHO KNEW THEM ASSURED ME THAT MY SECURITY WAS EXCELLENT
RECOGNISING SOME WHO WERE APPROACHING I CALLED OUT
IN THE MEANTIME HIS ANGER AND MY FEAR SUBSIDED
THESE ARE NEITHER THE WORDS NOR THE THOUGHTS OF A MADMAN BUT RATHER OF A SOUND AND WORTHY FELLOW. WITHOUT DELAY HE ORDERED HIS SECRETARY TO TAKE IT TO THE POPE AND PLACE IT IN HIS OWN HANDS ADDING A REQUEST FOR MY DELIVERANCE
AT LENGTH THE KING ARRIVED
IN THIS WAY WE PASSED SEVERAL EVENINGS AND THEN THE DUKE COMMISSIONED ME TO RESTORE THE STATUETTES
ON BEING ASKED BY HER WHAT I THOUGHT OF THEM I SAID IT WAS IN TRUTH A VERY HANDSOME ORNAMENT
IN 1540 HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF DUKE COSIMO AND DIED IN 1553
NOW SINCE YOU ARE A JEWELLER AND GOLDSMITH BY TRADE POPE CLEMENT BEING PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH YOU AND HAVING BY HIM NO ONE ELSE OF YOUR PROFESSION CALLED YOU INTO HIS SECRET COUNSELS AND MADE YOU UNSET ALL THE JEWELS OF HIS TIARAS MITRES AND RINGS
THE CARDINAL RETORTED ON THE SPOT
MY WORKPEOPLE AT THIS TIME WHO WERE PRETTY NUMEROUS INCLUDED BOTH SCULPTORS AND GOLDSMITHS
AND WHEN WE REACHED THE PLACE OF MEETING THE COMPANY HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED AND EVERYBODY CAME FORWARD TO GREET ME
SO THEN BEING THOROUGHLY RESOLVED I TURNED MY FACE TOWARD THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
THERE WE MET A NUMBER OF EXILES WHO STARED AT US AS THOUGH THEY WISHED TO MAKE US SPEAK WITH THEM
WELL THEN I DESIGNED PATTERNS OF THIS KIND AND FILLED THEM IN WITH GOLD AS I HAVE MENTIONED
BEFORE I LEFT THE POPE LAST NIGHT WE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING FAR SUPERIOR. TO THESE FIRST WORDS I ANSWERED WITHOUT ALLOWING HIM TO PROCEED FARTHER
BETTINI WAS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF BUONARROTI AND A CONSIDERABLE PATRON OF THE ARTS
I ALLOWED SEVERAL DAYS TO ELAPSE UNTIL I THOUGHT THEIR TEARS WERE DRIED AND THEN I BETOOK MYSELF TO PISA
PAIX PAIX SATAN ALLEZ PAIX THE LINE IN DANTE TO WHICH CELLINI ALLUDES IS THE FIRST OF THE SEVENTH CANTO OF THE INFERNO HIS SUGGESTION IS BOTH CURIOUS AND INGENIOUS
BOTH OF MY SERVANTS ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK WERE EQUALLY WELL TREATED
HE MARRIED FRANCESCA SALVIATI THE AUNT OF DUKE COSIMO
MESSER BASTIANO OF VENICE A MOST EXCELLENT PAINTER AND I WERE ADMITTED TO THEIR SOCIETY
I BADE ASCANIO REMEMBER WHAT GREAT BENEFITS I HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM AND THAT UP TO THE PRESENT HE HAD BEEN A MERE THOUGHTLESS LAD
IT WAS A MIRACLE TO OBSERVE THAT NOT ONE FRAGMENT REMAINED IN THE ORIFICE OF THE CHANNEL AND THAT NOTHING WAS WANTING TO THE STATUE
ONE CAN SEE THAT HIS HEART IS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIS WORK
AFTERWARDS I WROTE TO MAESTRO GIACOPO BEGGING HIM BY NO MEANS WHETHER FOR GOOD OR EVIL TO WRITE TO ME AGAIN
THEN I SOUGHT OUT THE OTHER FELLOW WHO HAD BROUGHT THE SUIT AND USED HIM ALSO IN SUCH WISE THAT HE DROPPED IT
AND SO I WENT AWAY
IN MY ENTHUSIASM I STROVE TO ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR IF YOU STICK TO YOUR OWN FANCIES YOU WILL RUN YOUR HEAD AGAINST A WALL. WHILE HE WAS UTTERING THESE WORDS HIS LORDS IN WAITING HUNG UPON THE KINGS LIPS SEEING HIM SHAKE HIS HEAD FROWN AND GESTICULATE NOW WITH ONE HAND AND NOW WITH THE OTHER
I SAID I HAD NO MONEY TO LEND BUT THAT IF HE LIKED TO JOIN ME I WOULD PAY HIS EXPENSES AS FAR AS LYONS
GIULIO ROMANO WENT TO PAINT FOR THE MARQUIS OF MANTUA
THIS IS A PIECE WHICH IT WILL TAKE THE LIVES OF TEN MEN TO FINISH
TO THIS I REPLIED THAT MY HONOUR WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO DO SO
LXXXIII WHEN I RETURNED TO BED I FELT SO AGITATED THAT I COULD NOT GET TO SLEEP AGAIN
HOWEVER LIGHT WAS WANTING
I AM AMUSING MYSELF BY WATCHING THIS WORTHY YOUNG MAN AT HIS DRAWING
THE MAN TURNED OUT TO BE THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WHO WAS CARRIED THROUGH THE TRENCHES TO A CERTAIN TAVERN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHITHER IN A SHORT WHILE ALL THE CHIEF FOLK OF THE ARMY CAME TOGETHER
TRIBOLO STOOD TREMBLING WITH FEAR AND NUDGED ME TO KEEP QUIET LEST THEY SHOULD DO SOMETHING WORSE TO US
BUT I PERCEIVING THAT THEY OFFERED NO RESISTANCE AND THAT HE WAS STRETCHED FOR DEAD UPON THE GROUND THOUGHT IT TOO BASE A THING TO TOUCH THEM
I WAS VERY BADLY PAID
IT SEEMS ALMOST A SIN TO LET AN ARTIST OF HIS ABILITIES WASTE HIS TIME. THE KING REPLIED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WELL AND TOLD HIM TO ARRANGE WITH ME ALL THINGS FOR MY SUPPORT ACCORDING TO MY WISHES
THE DECEASED POMPEO HAD LEFT THREE THOUSAND DUCATS AS DOWRY TO AN ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER OF HIS
IT WAS ENCLOSED BY A THICK HEDGE OF THORNS IN WHICH I HID MYSELF STANDING UPRIGHT AND WAITING TILL THE WOMAN CAME BACK WITH LUIGI
O PAGOLO MY SON DID THE SPONTOON THEN PIERCE THROUGH YOUR ARMOUR? NO, HE REPLIED FOR I PUT MY SHIRT OF MAIL IN THE VALISE THIS MORNING. SO THEN I SUPPOSE ONE WEARS CHAIN-MAIL IN ROME TO SWAGGER BEFORE LADIES BUT WHERE THERE IS DANGER AND ONE WANTS IT ONE KEEPS IT LOCKED UP IN A PORTMANTEAU
THIS WORTHY MAN BADE ME COME INTO HIS SHOP AND AT ONCE GAVE ME WORK TO DO AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS MAN&OELIG;UVRE WHICH I REPEATED TWICE THE SOLDIERS WERE THROWN INTO SUCH DISORDER THAT BEING MOREOVER ENCUMBERED WITH THE SPOILS OF THAT GREAT SACK AND SOME OF THEM DESIROUS OF ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOUR THEY OFTENTIMES SHOWED A MIND TO MUTINY AND TAKE THEMSELVES AWAY FROM ROME
WHEN WE CAME INTO THE PRESENCE I LOST NO TIME IN EXHIBITING THE GOLDEN PLATE UPON WHICH I HAD AS YET CARVED NOTHING BUT MY FIGURE OF GOD THE FATHER
JACOPO NARDI WAS THE EXCELLENT HISTORIAN OF FLORENCE A STRONG ANTI-MEDICEAN PARTISAN WHO WAS EXILED IN 1530
I RAN STORMING DOWN THE STAIRCASE
I WILL MENTION ANOTHER KIND OF GEM
AFTERWARDS HE WOULD TAKE THEM ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AT THE SAME TIME
ON THE INSTANT I DECIDED UPON BLOODSHED
HAVING MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCOMPLISH THE WHOLE AFFAIR WITH THIS MANS AID I NOW LET THE DUKE KNOW THAT BANDINELLO WAS LYING AND THAT I COULD GET ON FAMOUSLY WITHOUT HIS WORKPEOPLE
WHEN AT LAST WE GOT TO LAND WE HAD TO CLIMB THAT MOUNTAIN FOR TWO MILES AND IT WAS MORE TROUBLESOME THAN GETTING UP A LADDER
WE CONSTRUCTED AN ADMIRABLE LITTLE FURNACE FOR THE CASTING OF THE BRONZE GOT ALL THINGS READY AND BAKED OUR MOULDS
I COMPLAINED OF SOME ABOMINABLE ACTS OF INJUSTICE DONE TO ME BY MESSER ALFONSO QUISTELLI MESSER JACOPO POLVERINO OF THE EXCHEQUER AND MORE THAN ALL BY SER GIOVANBATTISTA BRANDINI OF VOLTERRA
YET WHEN A MAN HAS COME TO KNOW WHAT HE IS WORTH AFTER GAINING SOME ACQUIREMENTS AND WISHING TO AUGMENT THE GLORY OF HIS TOWN AND OF HIS GLORIOUS PRINCE IT IS QUITE RIGHT THAT HE SHOULD GO AND LABOUR ELSEWHERE
NOW THE HEADS OF THE FAMILIES ON BOTH SIDES TOOK PART IN IT AND THE FIRE KINDLED SEEMED TO THEM SO THREATENING THAT THEIR HOUSES WERE LIKE TO PERISH UTTERLY
AND STILL THEY KEPT ON URGING US TO HELP THEM
THEN WE SET SPURS TO OUR HORSES AND LEFT MESSER CHERUBINO AND THE MILANESE TO FOLLOW AT THEIR LEISURE
EXCUDEBAT PETRUS GALTERIUS LUTECIæ PARISIORUM PRID
THEN QUITE ANGRY HE SAID HE WOULD USE FORCE TO MAKE ME TAKE THEM
THE BOATMEN SHOUTED ONE TO THE OTHER CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE
LUCAGNOLO WHO WAS BURNING TO COMPARE HIS PACKET WITH MINE BURST INTO THE SHOP
THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CITY AND DROVE CLEMENT INTO THE CASTLE OF S
OTHERS WERE COMING ONE BY ONE TO EXPLAIN THEIR SEVERAL CAUSES TO THE JUDGE
AND BADE ME ARM MYSELF BEFOREHAND WITH THE ANSWER I SHOULD GIVE
1 THE INFINITE TROUBLES BROUGHT UPON ME BY MY EVIL FORTUNE CAUSED ME TO OMIT THE MENTION OF HIM AT AN EARLIER DATE
WHEN THAT POOR MAN POPE CLEMENT WANTED TO MAKE TERMS WITH THOSE THIEVES OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY WHO HAD ROBBED ROME AND INSULTED THE CHURCH A CERTAIN CESARE ISCATINARO IF I RIGHTLY REMEMBER HIS NAME CAME TO NEGOTIATE WITH HIM
THEN HE TOLD ME IN DETAIL HOW I HAD TO BEHAVE AND THE WORDS I HAD TO SAY
THE POPE SWELLED WITH RAGE BUT SAID NOTHING
PURSUING THE WAY TO OUR LODGING FOR THE NIGHT WE SHOWED OUR SCRATCHES AND BRUISES TO EACH OTHER
IT IS TRUE ALSO THAT I HAD COMMITTED HOMICIDES BUT HIS VICAR HAD CALLED ME FROM MY NATIVE CITY AND PARDONED ME BY THE AUTHORITY HE HAD FROM HIM AND FROM THE LAWS
WHILE I WAS STANDING THERE AND TALKING ONE OF THEM NAMED GHERARDO GUASCONTI THEIR COUSIN HAVING PERHAPS BEEN PUT UP TO IT BY THEM LAY IN WAIT TILL A BEAST OF BURDEN WENT BY
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE YOU FIX THEM IN ONE OF MY APARTMENTS WHERE THEY WILL BE PRESERVED WITH THE RESPECT DUE TO THEIR SINGULAR ARTISTIC QUALITIES. I OPPOSED THIS PLAN WITH MANY FORCIBLE ARGUMENTS
IT WAS A CAMEO ENGRAVED WITH HERCULES BINDING CERBERUS OF THE TRIPLE THROAT
THE ITALIANS RECKONED TIME FROM SUNDOWN TILL SUNDOWN COUNTING TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
MY BENVENUTO THE DESIGN OF MESSER LUIGI AND THAT OF MESSER GABRIELLO PLEASE ME BOTH SO WELL THAT I KNOW NOT HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
AND I HAD A SIMILAR JACKET AND WAISTCOAT MADE FOR CENCIO
I FASHIONED THE STEEL DIES FOR STAMPING THIS MEDAL IN MY OWN HOUSE
GO THEN WITH MIND AT REST TO TAKE YOUR PLEASURE AND DIVERT YOUR SPIRITS
WHILE SPEAKING OF THE MODEL I SAID BEFORE HOW I HAD REPRESENTED SEA AND EARTH SEATED WITH THEIR LEGS INTERLACED AS WE OBSERVE IN THE CASE OF FIRTHS AND PROMONTORIES
THIS GIFT IS VERY DEAR TO ME
ATTEND TO YOUR HEALTH AND TAKE ALL THINGS FOR THE BEST
DURING THOSE DAYS THE POPE SENT FOR ME AND LEADING CAUTIOUSLY IN CONVERSATION TO THE TOPIC OF THE COINS ASKED ME AT THE FITTING MOMENT
AND SO I WENT ON LABOURING INCESSANTLY AT ALL OF THEM
KNOWING THAT THIS IS THE SEAT OF CHRIST I ENTERTAINED THE REASONABLE BELIEF THAT WHEN SOME TEMPORAL PRINCE SOUGHT TO INFLICT ON ME A MORTAL INJURY I MIGHT HAVE RECOURSE TO THIS HOLY CHAIR AND TO THIS VICAR OF CHRIST IN CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD SURELY UPHOLD MY CAUSE
I SHALL NOT BE ALIVE TOMORROW. THEY TRIED TO ENCOURAGE ME ARGUING THAT MY ILLNESS WOULD PASS OVER SINCE IT CAME FROM EXCESSIVE FATIGUE
FOR THOUGH SHE HAS DONE ME THIS ABOMINABLE WRONG I PARDON HER WITH ALL MY SOUL
I HAD LIVED VERY HANDSOMELY IN PARIS AND THEREFORE THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF COSTLY HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE
THIS WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING I LIFTED FROM BENEATH UNCOVERING THE HANDSOME GENITAL MEMBERS OF THE GOD
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD GATHERED THE SENSE OF MY ARGUMENTS BEFORE HE CAME UP TO WHERE WE STOOD
I TOLD HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO LET ME CONCEAL THE JEWELS ABOUT HIS OWN PERSON WHICH WOULD BE MUCH LESS DANGEROUS THAN CARRYING THEM IN THE GOBLET
AND GOING OFF HIS FELLOWS ALSO LAUGHED AND WAGGED THEIR HEADS WITH MANY OTHER INSOLENT GESTURES
NOT YEARS OR MONTHS I SAY BUT ONLY A FEW WEEKS WILL PASS BEFORE THIS DIRTY INGRATITUDE OF YOURS SHALL PLUNGE YOU INTO RUIN. TO THESE WORDS ANSWERED PIERINO AND SAID
I PRAY AND COMMAND YOU FOR THE LOVE OF ME TO PACK OFF AND GO THITHER
WHEN I SHOWED IT TO THE JEWELLERS ONE OF THE BEST AMONG THEM WHO WAS CALLED RAFFAEL DEL MORO TOOK THE DIAMOND IN HIS HAND AND SAID TO GAIO
THESE THINGS HE SAID WITH SUCH ODD WAGGINGS OF THE HEAD THAT WE NEVER STOPPED FROM LAUGHING AND SO PURSUED OUR JOURNEY MIRTHFULLY TO FLORENCE
SO CARRY OUT THE DESIGN WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU. TO THESE BRAVE WORDS I ANSWERED AS GENTLY AS I COULD AND SAID
MEANWHILE I INFORMED MY FRIEND WHAT KIND OF TRICK I HAD PLAYED OUR HOST AND SHOWED HIM SPECIMENS OF THE BED-COVERS AND OTHER THINGS WHICH THREW HIM INTO SUCH A QUAKING FRIGHT THAT HE ROARED OUT TO THE BARGEE
TAKE YOUR ARMS AND GO AWAY
AND WHEN I FOUND HIM WELL DISPOSED FOR WHAT I WANTED I ENTREATED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO DISMISS ME IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT SO THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE TO WASTE THE FEW YEARS IN WHICH I SHOULD BE FIT TO DO ANYTHING
SAVE ME, AND WANTED TO THROW HIMSELF UPON MY NECK
COME TAKE YOURSELVES OUT OF MY SIGHT AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU A THOUSAND TIMES
WHEN I FIRED MY GUNS THEY HURTLED DOWN LIKE MAD OCCASIONING ALL SORTS OF UNEXPECTED MISCHIEF IN THE TRENCHES
FOR ONE OF THEM IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE AND THE DAY PERCHANCE WILL COME WHEN THE OTHER WILL BE FOUND THE CAUSE OF SOMETHING EVEN WORSE. HE THEN BEGGED ME IF I SHOULD BE ASKED NOT TO SAY THAT HE WAS WITH ME WHEN I FIRED THE GUN
GET ME REMOVED FROM HERE AT ONCE FOR I HAVE BUT FEW HOURS TO LIVE. THEY HAD ACQUAINTED ME WITH THE WHOLE EVENT WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING IN BRIEF WORDS BEFITTING SUCH OCCASION
HIS ADMIRAL WAS DIRECTED TO COMMAND THE CITIZENS TO OBEY ME UNDER PAIN OF HIS DISPLEASURE
NOTE 8
NOTE 8
NOTE 8
NOTE 8
GIANGIACOMO TOLD HIM MY NAME IN FULL
RECAPTURED FIND THE PRISON TEN TIMES WORSE
AND MEANWHILE I GAVE MY WHOLE MIND TO MY STUDIES
IT WENT OFF OF ITSELF
HE COAXED AND ENTREATED ME TO GIVE IT HIM
HOWEVER AFTER COMING TO TERMS WITH THEIR VALIANT CAPTAIN GIAN DI URBINO 4 THEY WERE ULTIMATELY COMPELLED AT THEIR EXCESSIVE INCONVENIENCE TO TAKE ANOTHER ROAD WHEN THEY CHANGED GUARD
IS NOT THIS BENVENUTO THE MAN WHOM I HAVE SO WARMLY DEFENDED WHOM I KNOW OF A SURETY TO BE INNOCENT AND WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY WRONGED
LAURA BATTIFERRA AMMANATOS WIFE WAS A WOMAN OF IRREPROACHABLE CHARACTER WHOM CELLINI HIMSELF PRAISED IN A SONNET
1 THIS POEM I MEAN TO INSERT IN ITS PROPER PLACE
I WILL BE SURE TO REMIND YOU. THEN THEY DEPARTED AND IN ADDITION TO THE THINGS I HAD BEGUN I NOW TOOK THE MODEL OF THE FOUNTAIN IN HAND AT WHICH I WORKED ASSIDUOUSLY
I USED FREQUENTLY TO PASS THE NIGHT WITH HER
FOR IF HE FOUND HIMSELF A RICH MAN HE MIGHT HAVE INVESTED HIS MONEY IN ITALY AND THE MOMENT SOME CAPRICE TOOK OF HIM HE WOULD HAVE DECAMPED WITHOUT HESITATION
MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST EXCELLENT MAN CAME FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A DAY
SO WHEN I RETURNED FROM THE FARM WHICH IS TWO MILES DISTANT FROM VICCHIO TOWARD THE ALPI 2 I MET THE PRIEST WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME WITH HIS CUSTOMARY POLITENESS
IT IS YOU THAT SAY IT AND NOT I
AND INASMUCH AS I HAD NOT MONEY ENOUGH TO TAKE ME HOME RESPECTABLY I THOUGHT I WOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF THIS AND GIVE IT BACK AGAIN WHEN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD OFFER
IT IS TRUE THAT I FELT THE VICTUALS SCRUNCH BENEATH MY TEETH
AND THEY GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A FORMAL PROCEEDING DONE INDEED AT THE KINGS ORDERS BUT WHICH HAD NOT ANY GREAT SIGNIFICANCE
HE WAS A PERSON OF GREAT SAGACITY AND DID WISELY TO GET OUT OF ROME
WHILE I WHO INCLINED TO BELIEVE PARTLY IN THEIR MURDEROUS ATTACK RESOLVED THAT I WOULD DEFEND MYSELF WITH COURAGE
HERE IS THE MASTER! WHEN I SAW THE PAIR ADVANCING OVERCOME WITH FRIGHT THEIR CLOTHES IN DISORDER NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY SAID NOR LIKE PEOPLE IN A TRANCE WHERE THEY WERE GOING IT WAS ONLY TOO EASY TO GUESS WHAT THEY HAD BEEN ABOUT
THE GENTLEMEN HOWEVER WERE NOT AS YET QUITE AT THEIR EASE
THOUGH I WAS QUITE AS FRIGHTENED AS THE REST OF THEM I TRIED TO SHOW IT LESS AND INSPIRED THEM ALL WITH MARVELLOUS COURAGE
I WILL LISTEN PATIENTLY TO ANY ARGUMENT YOU CAN POSSIBLY PRODUCE IN EXPLANATION OF YOUR STATEMENT WHICH MAY CONVINCE ME OF ITS PROBABILITY. I SAID IN ANSWER
AND INSTEAD OF GIVING US MONEY FOR HE HAD NONE HE BESTOWED ON US HIS BLESSING
YOU GALLOWS-BIRD
BUT IT SEEMED THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME WAS THE SAME AS WHAT HAPPENS TO UNLUCKY PEOPLE IN THE STREET WHEN A STONE FALLS FROM SOME GREAT HEIGHT UPON THEIR HEAD AND KILLS THEM
I HAD SO MANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE UPON MY HANDS THAT IF I KILLED HIM I COULD HARDLY HOPE TO SAVE MY LIFE
THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RECOLLECTION MAKES CELLINI MORE THAN USUALLY INCOHERENT ABOUT THIS EPISODE
THE TRUTH IS THAT I HAD ARRANGED TO ELOPE WITH THE GIRL FOR A YEAR TO FLORENCE UNKNOWN TO HER MOTHER
ALL THE WHILE THAT WE WERE GOING TOWARD OUR HOUSES IN THE BANCHI HE KEPT SAYING THAT TWO OF THE DEVILS HE HAD SEEN IN THE COLISEUM WERE GAMBOLING IN FRONT OF US SKIPPING NOW ALONG THE ROOFS AND NOW UPON THE GROUND
IN HIS SERVICE I GAINED MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND GOLDEN CROWNS THE YEAR. WITH THESE AND SUCH LIKE WORDS I CUT THEIR CEREMONIES SHORT THANKING THEM FOR THE HIGH PRAISES THEY HAD BESTOWED UPON ME WHICH WERE INDEED THE BEST REWARD THAT ARTISTS COULD RECEIVE FOR THEIR LABOURS
THE NOISE WE MADE BROUGHT THE NEIGHBOURS OUT WITH LIGHTS
THERE IS NO NEED TO SPEND MONEY IN COURIERS FOR YOU KNOW THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN
IF ANY MAN YOU LIKE TO NAME HAD ORDERED A PALACE OR A HOUSE TO BE BUILT HE COULD WITH JUSTICE TELL THE MASTER-MASON:I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GO ON WORKING AT MY HOUSE OR PALACE; AND AFTER PAYING HIM HIS LABOUR HE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISMISS HIM
TOGETHER WITH THIS MAN THEY DETECTED A METAL-FOUNDER OF THE MINT
WHEREFORE WHEN I PROPOSED TO PAY FOR THE HORSES WHICH WERE TO COST FIVE HUNDRED DUCATS THEIR OWNER ANSWERED
YOU ARE CERTAINLY IN THE WRONG THERE MY LORD
IV ANDREA CELLINI WAS YET ALIVE WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS OLD AND HE HAD PASSED HIS HUNDREDTH
MICHEL AGNOLO FOLLOWED AND ON ENTERING THE ROOM AND LOOKING ROUND HE EXCLAIMED
ON THIS OCCASION HE LEFT THE SONNET OF MESSER BENEDETTO VARCHI WHICH RUNS AS FOLLOWS
SO HE HAD BEEN WITH ME SOME MONTHS
HIS OWN BEST QUALITIES INDEED WERE DERIVED FROM THE ADMIRABLE MANNER OF ROSSO WHO BY THIS TIME HAD DIED
GIROLAMO DE ROSSI KNOWN IN LITERATURE AS A POET AND HISTORIAN OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
SO THAT THEIR MANNERS WERE AN OFFENCE TO GOD AND A DISGRACE TO THE CITY OF SIENA
THEN WRITE TO ME AND HAVE NO FURTHER CARE ABOUT YOUR THINGS. I DID AS HE ADVISED
THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NEVER GONE THAT WAY ABOUT THE BUSINESS
SEE FOR FURTHER PARTICULARS SYMONDS RENAISSANCE IN ITALY VOL
1 THE BOY WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AND I TWO YEARS OLDER
IT HAPPENED THAT THE CASTELLAN WAS ALSO TAKING THE AIR THERE
VERY VIVID TOO IS THE IMPRESSION WE RECEIVE OF THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
I WAS RESIGNED AND BLESSED THE WORLD AND ALL THE YEARS WHICH I HAD PASSED IN IT
WHEN THE KING WAS INFORMED OF THIS HE SENT WORD THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE THEIR MINDS TO LEARNING AND NOT TRY TO TEACH THEIR MASTER
I ANSWERED THAT OF COURAGE FOR THE TASK I HAD NO LACK AND THAT I HAD SEEN HOW DIES WERE MADE BUT THAT I HAD NOT EVER MADE ANY
IT WAS THUS THAT THE WONDERFUL CUPOLA AND THE LOVELY DOORS OF SAN GIOVANNI HAD BEEN PRODUCED TOGETHER WITH THOSE MULTITUDES OF HANDSOME EDIFICES AND STATUES WHICH MADE A CROWN OF ARTISTIC GLORY FOR THEIR CITY ABOVE ANYTHING THE WORLD HAD SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF THE ANCIENTS
OH GO AND REPORT THE WHOLE THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE POPE
THE DUKE AT THIS POINT MOVED AWAY AND PROCEEDED THROUGH SOME GROUND FLOOR ROOMS WHILE BANDINELLO FOLLOWED
BUT FINDING THAT IT WOULD TAKE RATHER LONG TO CARRY IT OUT IN THIS WAY I RESOLVED UPON ANOTHER EXPEDIENT ESPECIALLY AS NOW A WRETCHED LITTLE STUDIO HAD BEEN ERECTED BRICK ON BRICK SO MISERABLY BUILT THAT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF IT GIVES ME PAIN
BUT FOR HIS GENUINE EMOTION HE FOUND SPURIOUS VEHICLES OF UTTERANCE
I DID NOT MERELY EXPECT HIM TO DISCHARGE HIS DEBT BUT ALSO TO SHOW ME FAVOUR AND ASSIST IN PLACING ME IN THAT GREAT MONARCHS SERVICE
MI FECE UNA POLIZZA A POLIZZA WAS AN ORDER FOR MONEY PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL WITH OUR CHEQUE LXX I LEFT NAPLES BY NIGHT WITH MY MONEY IN MY POCKET AND THIS I DID TO PREVENT BEING SET UPON OR MURDERED AS IS THE WAY THERE
WHAT DISPLEASURE HAVE YOU GIVEN TO THAT RASCAL OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI? I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME
BENVENUTO YOU WOULD DO WELL TO ACT AS I ADVISE YOU. THEN SHE TURNED HER BACK AND LEFT ME
THE NECROMANCER ASSURED ME THAT OFTEN AS HE HAD ENTERED MAGIC CIRCLES HE HAD NEVER MET WITH SUCH A SERIOUS AFFAIR AS THIS
WHEN I SAW HOW COLDLY THINGS WERE GOING FORWARD I BEGAN TO FEEL DISMAYED
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE WELL TO CONFESS ME BEFORE
MARIA NOVELLA THOSE VIRTUOUS FRIARS OF THE NUNZIATA UNANIMOUSLY TOLD ME TO PLACE IT IN THEIR CHURCH AND LET ME MAKE MY GRAVE ACCORDING TO MY WILL AND PLEASURE
I HAVE A MIND TO POSSESS THESE PEARLS
MICHEL AGNOLO DESERVES MORE THAN YOU HAVE PROMISED AND I WILL BESTOW ON HIM STILL GREATER FAVOURS. TO THIS LETTER HE SENT NO ANSWER AND I COULD SEE THAT THE DUKE WAS MUCH OFFENDED WITH HIM
AMONG OTHERS I HAD TO SUPPLY ALL THE ORNAMENTS OF GOLD AND JEWELS FOR THE WIFE OF SIGNOR GIEROLIMO ORSINO FATHER OF SIGNOR PAOLO WHO IS NOW THE SON-IN-LAW OF OUR DUKE COSIMO
MY JOY ON GREETING THE OLD MAN WAS SO INTENSE THAT WHILE HE EMBRACED AND KISSED ME I THOUGHT THAT I MUST DIE UPON THE SPOT
AT LAST IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THEY REFUSED TO FOLLOW
IT WAS NOT NEEDFUL THAT I SHOULD PLACE IN THEIR EXCELLENCIES HANDS WHAT I HAD ALWAYS FRANKLY LEFT TO THEM FROM THE FIRST DAYS WHEN I UNDERTOOK THEIR SERVICE
I WAS CHARGED WITH LIGHTING THE BEACONS AND FIRING THE GUNS FOR THIS PURPOSE
I DO NOT WISH HIM TO PRACTISE ANY ART BUT PLAYING AND COMPOSING
34
THIS LAWSUIT TORMENTED ME BEYOND MEASURE AND TOOK UP SO MUCH OF MY TIME THAT I OFTEN THOUGHT OF DECAMPING IN DESPAIR FROM THE COUNTRY
MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED
AND SO BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER WROUGHT ME MUCH PROFIT AND MORE CREDIT AND IN BOTH OF THEM I CONTINUED TO PRODUCE THINGS OF MARKED ORIGINALITY
1 HE SENT WORD TO ME THROUGH MESSER&HELLIP LIVING&HELLIP STREET THAT I MIGHT NOW DO WHAT I LIKED WITH MY MODEL SINCE HE HAD WON THE MARBLE
BUT I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY LABORIOUS AND WELL-TRAINED STUDIES THAT I HOPE TO WIN THE PALM EVEN AGAINST THE GREAT MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI FROM WHOM AND FROM NO ONE ELSE I HAVE LEARNED ALL THAT I KNOW
THE MAN I CHOSE WAS BERNARDO SALITI WHO EXECUTED HIS COMMISSION ADMIRABLY
WHAT GOD SHALL HAVE ORDAINED THAT WILL YOU DO AND NOT A JOT OR LITTLE MORE. WHERETO THE SAME MAN REPLIED THAT FOR CERTAIN GOD HAD ORDAINED AS HE HAD SPOKEN
1 SO LONG AS SODERINI REMAINED IN FLORENCE HE SHOWED THE UTMOST GOOD-WILL TO MY FATHER
IT IS THAT YOU CANNOT BRING YOUR GREAT GIFTS TO LIGHT BY YOUR OWN STRENGTH ALONE
ACCORDINGLY HE COMMISSIONED A CERTAIN LITTLE DEVIL OF A CORSICAN SOLDIER IN HIS SERVICE TO DO THE TRICK AS CLEVERLY AS HE COULD
NOW THE ADMIRAL HAD BEEN APPOINTED THROUGH MADAME DETAMPES INFLUENCE RATHER THAN FROM ANY PROOF OF HIS ABILITY FOR HE WAS A MAN OF LITTLE TALENT
2 BUT ALSO BECAUSE MY ADVERSARIES HAD BEEN TO THE HOUSES OF THOSE MAGISTRATES AND HAD TALKED WITH ALL OF THEM IN PRIVATE WHILE I INEXPERIENCED IN SUCH MATTERS HAD NOT SPOKEN TO ANY OF THEM TRUSTING IN THE GOODNESS OF MY CAUSE
WHEN WE REACHED ROME I PUT MYSELF UNDER A MASTER WHO WAS KNOWN AS IL FIRENZUOLA
3 I WILL NOT ADD FURTHER PARTICULARS
NOW THE CHOIR WAS BY BANDINELLO AND I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ENRICH HIS BAD WORK WITH MY LABOURS
TELL HIS HOLINESS THAT HE HAS DEPRIVED HIMSELF AND NOT ME OF THE MINT AND THAT HE WILL BE DOING THE SAME WITH REGARD TO THOSE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH HE SPEAKS
AND THUS IT RAN FOR SOME MONTHS
TELL THEM THAT I AM HUDDLING MY CLOTHES ON AND WILL COME OUT TO THEM IN MY SHIRT. SUPPOSING IT WAS A TRAP LAID TO MURDER ME AS HAD BEFORE BEEN DONE BY SIGNOR PIER LUIGI I SEIZED AN EXCELLENT DAGGER WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND WITH THE LEFT I TOOK THE SAFE-CONDUCT
WE SHALL FIND WHEN WE COME TO CELLINIS SERVICE UNDER DUKE COSIMO THAT PRINCES SPENT MUCH OF THEIR TIME IN THIS PLACE
I BROKE AWAY UPON THE RIGHT HAND AND GOT THROUGH SOME HEDGES MAKING MY YOUNG MEN AND BUSBACCA TAKE THAT WAY
BUT I BEGGED HIM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TO STOP TALKING SEEING I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO COMPOSE MYSELF ALONE IN QUIET
ANTONIO LANDI WAS A FLORENTINE GENTLEMAN MERCHANT AND AUTHOR
THE OTHER COULD CLAIM NOBLER BIRTH BUT HIS NAME HAS ESCAPED ME
BUT WHEN MY MOULD IS MORE THAN HALF FULL AS I EXPECT FROM THIS MIDDLE POINT UPWARDS THE FIRE ASCENDING BY ITS NATURAL PROPERTY THEN THE HEADS OF PERSEUS AND MEDUSA WILL COME OUT ADMIRABLY
MY COMPANIONS WANTED TO BEGIN THE FRAY AT ONCE
WHAT WOULD OUR FRIENDS SPEAK OF US TO-MORROW IF HAVING LEFT FOR ROME WE HAD NOT PLUCK TO GET BEYOND SIENA? THEN THE GOOD TASSO SAID I SPOKE THE TRUTH
AND BENVENUTO SHALL I BE THIS DAY TO YOU
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED I MADE MY MIND UP THAT THEY MUST HAVE ADMINISTERED A DOSE OF SUBLIMATE IN THE SAUCE WHICH WAS VERY WELL MADE AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE INASMUCH AS SUBLIMATE PRODUCES ALL THE SYMPTOMS
THIS PLACE WAS WORTH SIX GOLDEN CROWNS A MONTH IN ADDITION TO THE DIES WHICH WERE PAID AT THE RATE OF A DUCAT FOR THREE BY THE MASTER OF THE MINT
THE REASON WAS AS FOLLOWS
BEFORE I TOOK LEAVE OF HIS HOLINESS WE HAD AGREED ON EVERY DETAIL AND CALCULATED THE PRICE OF THE WORK
1 AND EACH ONE OF YOU SHALL LIVE TO I SEE IT EXECUTED A HUNDRED TIMES MORE RICHLY THAN THE MODEL
HE REPLIED THAT I WAS HIS GOOD SON BUT THAT THE OTHER WHOM HE THOUGHT TO HAVE LOST HAD BEEN FOUND AGAIN
BUT DO NOT FORGET TO SEND A COUPLE OF LINES BY WAY OF MEMORANDUM AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME. I WROTE FOUR LINES THAT VERY DAY IN WHICH I THANKED HIS EXCELLENCY FOR EXPECTED FAVOURS AND GAVE THESE TO MESSER SFORZA WHO PLACED THEM IN THE DUKES HANDS
I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL SUCCEED WITH YOUR JUPITER BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT PROVIDED SUFFICIENT VENTS BENEATH FOR THE AIR TO CIRCULATE
IT IS OUR PART TO INVENT AND YOURS TO EXECUTE
THIS STUNG ME TO THE QUICK AND I EXCLAIMED
ENOUGH THAT I WAS CRUELLY WRONGED AT THE WILL OF A RICH CITIZEN ONLY BECAUSE HE MADE USE OF THAT SHEPHERD-FELLOW
FOR EVEN AS HIS MAJESTY WAS WONT TO SHOWER REWARDS AND FAVOURS UPON MEN OF PARTS AND VIRTUE SO DID HE EVER CHASTISE THE TROUBLESOME
2 I WHO WAS THE HOST OF THOSE GREAT ARTISTS AND MEN OF WORTH TAKING THE INSULT TO MYSELF SLIPPED OUT QUIETLY WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED AND WENT UP TO HIM
CONSEQUENTLY WE HAD TO JOURNEY AFTER IT THROUGH PLACES WHERE SOMETIMES THERE WERE SCARCELY TWO HOUSES TO BE FOUND
FOR I HEARD HIM SAY
THE FIRST OF THESE WHICH CAUSED ME THE GREATEST ANXIETY WAS THAT SEEING ME SPEND SO LONG A TIME UPON MY STATUE THE DUKE HIMSELF MIGHT GET DISGUSTED
TAKE YOUR GOOD ARMS AND COME WITH ME
TAKE HEED YOU DO NOT GO! HALF TERRIFIED I THEN FOLLOWED HIM TO THE PALACE
IT WAS THE LIONS PAW BUT INSTEAD OF A LILY I MADE THE LION HOLD AN AXE WITH THE FIELD OF THE SCUTCHEON QUARTERED
THE DIAMOND ALONE PRESERVES ITS TRENCHANT QUALITIES
PLACE ME BETWEEN YOU AND TAKE ME AS YOUR PRISONER WHERE YOU LIKE. THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN WITH THE MOST PERFECT MANNERS BURST OUT LAUGHING AND PUT ME BETWEEN THEM
NOR COULD I DISCOVER ANY REASONABLE GROUND FOR HOPE THAT I MIGHT PROSPER IN THE FUTURE WITH MY PRINCE AND PATRON
LEO X HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS DUKEDOM AND GIVEN IT TO A MEDICEAN PRINCE
BUT THE POPE TOOK UP MY CAUSE WITH SPIRIT
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS
THIS ASSERTION IS WELL SUPPORTED BY CONTEMPORARY LETTERS OF CARO AND ALAMANNI
THEREFORE I HAVE ALREADY DESIGNED ONE AND IF IT IS YOUR PLEASURE I WILL AT ONCE EXHIBIT MY CONCEPTION. THE KING TURNED WITH A LIVELY MOVEMENT OF SURPRISE AND PLEASURE TO THE LORDS IN HIS COMPANY--THEY WERE THE KING OF NAVARRE THE CARDINAL OF LORRAINE AND THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA--EXCLAIMING AS HE DID SO
I WAS SUMMONED INTO ONE OF THE GREAT HALLS OF THE PAPAL CASTLE A PLACE OF MUCH DIGNITY
HE HAD LIVED SOME YEARS IN NAPLES AND BEING ENDOWED WITH GREAT CHARMS OF PERSON AND PRESENCE HAD BEEN THE LOVER OF A NEAPOLITAN PRINCESS
BUT I ADDED
HE WAS ASSASSINATED ON SEPTEMBER 10 1547
YET COMPELLED BY NECESSITY UNWILLING TO LOSE THE FAVOUR OF SO GREAT A PRINCESS I TOOK THOSE CONFOUNDED PEARLS SORELY AGAINST MY INCLINATION AND WENT WITH THEM OVER TO THE OTHER ROOM WHITHER THE DUKE HAD WITHDRAWN
I CARRIED WITH ME THE WAX MODEL WHICH I HAD MADE IN ROME AT THE CARDINAL OF FERRARAS REQUEST
2 THEREUPON I LAUGHED AND AS I SAID NOTHING MESSER ALBERTO BENDEDIO WHO WAS A HAUGHTY MAN FLEW INTO A RAGE AND SAID
CI WHILE I WAS ENGAGED IN PROSECUTING MY AFFAIRS WITH SO MUCH VIGOUR THERE ARRIVED A LETTER SENT POST-HASTE TO ME BY THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS BENVENUTO OUR DEAR FRIEND,-DURING THESE LAST DAYS THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING HERE MADE MENTION OF YOU AND SAID THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU IN HIS SERVICE
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF NOTHING ELSE BUT HOW TO GIVE YOU A REVERSE WORTHY OF HIS EXCELLENCY. THE DUKE LAUGHED A LITTLE AND LOOKING AT LORENZO SAID
I HAD IT IS TRUE MURMURED AGAINST MY LOT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SO FAR AS HUMAN LAWS GO MY DEPARTURE FROM THE WORLD IN THIS WAY WOULD BE TOO UNJUST
YOUR BENVENUTO WILL GET MUCH MORE HONOUR AND PROFIT IF HE DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE GOLDSMITHS TRADE THAN TO THIS PIPING. THESE WORDS MADE MY FATHER ANGRY SEEING THAT I TOO HAD THE SAME OPINION AS PIERO THAT HE FLEW INTO A RAGE AND CRIED OUT AT HIM
THIS TAVERN HAD FOR SIGN A SUN PAINTED BETWEEN TWO WINDOWS OF A BRIGHT RED COLOUR
HE ENJOYED GREAT REPUTATION AND WAS PRAISED BY VARCHI IN A SONNET FOR HIS MASTERY OF EMBROIDERY
THESE CREATURES ARE ALL INFERIOR TO US AND WHAT YOU SEE IS ONLY SMOKE AND SHADOW
AS FOR THE TRIFLING HONOURS WHICH I HAVE GAINED FOR MY HOUSE UNDER THE WELL-KNOWN CONDITIONS OF OUR PRESENT WAYS OF LIVING AND BY MEANS OF MY ART ALBEIT THE SAME ARE MATTERS OF NO GREAT MOMENT I WILL RELATE THESE IN THEIR PROPER TIME AND PLACE TAKING MUCH MORE PRIDE IN HAVING BEEN BORN HUMBLE AND HAVING LAID SOME HONOURABLE FOUNDATION FOR MY FAMILY THAN IF I HAD BEEN BORN OF GREAT LINEAGE AND HAD STAINED OR OVERCLOUDED THAT BY MY BASE QUALITIES
AS THESE MAY BE DESCRIBED BRIEFLY I WILL NOT HERE OMIT THEIR MENTION IN ORDER TO EXPOSE THE SHAMELESSNESS OF SUCH INGRATITUDE
NOW THAT GOD HAS SENT ME SO MAGNIFICENT A PATRON I HOPE TO PERFORM FOR HIM A MULTITUDE OF GREAT AND SPLENDID MASTER-PIECES. I BELIEVE IT  SAID THE KING AND ROSE FROM TABLE
I TOOK WITH ME MY SERVANT BERNARDINO OF MUGELLO
WE AGREED TO CALL IN SER PIERFRANCESCO BERTOLDI NOTARY AT THE MERCANTANZIA
THIS MAN BECAME AN OUTLAW AND WAS FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY CARDINAL COLONNA THEN AT WAR WITH CLEMENT VII
TRIBOLO STOPPED BEHIND ALL HUDDLED UP UPON HIS HORSE LOOKING THE VERY IMAGE OF FROST
OH HOW FAR MORE HAPPY AM I THUS THAN I WAS THEN! THE PERSONS WHO HEARD ME SPEAK THESE WORDS REPORTED THEM TO THE CASTELLAN
THEREFORE I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR DRAWING IS NO BETTER THAN YOUR STATUES. WHEN HE SAW THE AMUSED EXPRESSION ON THE DUKES FACE AND THE CUTTING GESTURES OF THE BYSTANDERS HE LET HIS INSOLENCE GET THE BETTER OF HIM AND TURNED TO ME WITH THAT MOST HIDEOUS FACE OF HIS SCREAMING ALOUD
WHEN AT LAST I VENTURED TO RELAX MY RIGID DIET I FOUND MYSELF AS WHOLLY FREE FROM THOSE INFIRMITIES AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN BORN AGAIN
HE SENT AGAIN TO ASK THROUGH DON DIEGO WHETHER I WOULD NOT GIVE ASCANIO BACK THE CLOTHES HE HAD RECEIVED FROM ME
THIRDLY THE MEDUSA CAST BY ME IN BRONZE HERE NOW BEFORE YOUR EXCELLENCYS EYES THE EXECUTION OF WHICH WAS A GREATER TRIUMPH OF STRENGTH AND SKILL THAN ANY OF MY PREDECESSORS IN THIS FIENDISH ART HAVE YET ACHIEVED
THE MESSENGER NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT ME AND HEARING WHAT SPLENDID OFFERS HAD BEEN MADE ME BY THE KING BEGGED MY PARDON OVER AND OVER AGAIN
LXXXII THE MISERABLE BARGAIN I HAD MADE WITH BINDO ALTOVITI LOSING MY BUST AND LEAVING HIM MY CAPITAL FOR LIFE TAUGHT ME WHAT THE FAITH OF MERCHANTS IS
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE GREAT PERIL HAD BEEN THUS AVERTED HE TOOK THE OCCURRENCE FOR A GOOD AUGURY
PRATI SO FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT WAS AN OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE BORGO AND THE BRIDGE OF S
YET YOU MUST KNOW THAT WE HAD NO ILL-WILL AGAINST HIM. THESE WORDS HE SPOKE BECAUSE OF THE CARDINALS WHO WERE AROUND HIM AND HAD LISTENED TO THE ELOQUENCE OF THAT BRAVE-SPIRITED LADY
SHALL I THEN FORSWEAR FLORENCE AND FRANCE THROUGH THEM FOR EVERMORE
THE FELLOW BEGAN TO BAWL OUT IN HIS RUSTIC WAY
AND HE DID THIS BY THE HAND OF THAT GIOVANNI OF PRATO THE DRUGGIST THEN SOLDIER IN THE CASTLE WHOM I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
HE WHO CAUSED THEM TO BUILT THEY SAY WAS JULIUS CæSAR IN CONCERT WITH SOME NOBLE ROMANS WHO WHEN FIESOLE HAD BEEN STORMED AND TAKEN RAISED A CITY IN THIS PLACE AND EACH OF THEM TOOK IN HAND TO ERECT ONE OF THESE NOTABLE EDIFICES
BUT FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS WHICH I RECEIVED BELONG TO HIS HOLINESS AND I AM READY TO RETURN THEM
BUT FOR MY PRESENT LACHES I SNAP MY FINGERS AT YOUR GALLEYS
I SAW THAT LETHAL HERALDRY DECLINE FROM HEAVEN LIKE LIGHTNING AMONG PEOPLE VAIN
FOR JUST AT THAT MOMENT FOUR SOLDIERS WITH DRAWN SWORDS SPRANG OUT FROM ANTEAS LODGING AND OBLIGED ME TO SET HAND TO MY OWN SWORD TO DEFEND MY LIFE
IF WHAT YOU SAY WERE THE TRUTH I RUN NO RISK OF HAVING TO SUBMIT TO CORPORAL PUNISHMENT SINCE THE AUTHORITY OF THE LAW WAS SUSPENDED DURING THAT SEASON
THEN HE TURNED TO GIOVANNI
WHEREFORE HIS HOLINESS TOGETHER WITH THE BOOK PRESENTS ME ALSO AND ATTACHES ME TO YOUR MAJESTY IN ORDER THAT I MAY COMPLETE THE WORK
AND WHEN HE SAW MY DRAWINGS AND THE THINGS WHICH I WAS MAKING HE SAID
BUT I SAID THAT A CERTAIN MAESTRO GIOVANNI OF CASTEL BOLOGNESE HAD JUST COME TO ROME VERY INGENIOUS IN THE ART OF MAKING MEDALS OF THE SORT I MADE IN STEEL AND THAT I THIRSTED FOR NOTHING MORE THAN TO COMPETE WITH HIM AND TAKE THE WORLD BY STORM WITH SOME GREAT MASTERPIECE WHICH I HOPED WOULD ANNIHILATE ALL THOSE ENEMIES OF MINE BY THE FORCE OF GENIUS AND NOT THE SWORD
SIRE THIS IS AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING
SINCE WE ARE HERE AND DRAW OUR LIVELIHOOD FROM HIM IT IS OUR DUTY TO GO WITH HIM AND BEAR HIM OUT SO LONG AS WE HAVE LIFE TO EXECUTE WHAT HE PROPOSES
GO IN PEACE
XLII I LEFT THE JUPITER THERE MEANING TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING
3 THERE DOWN THE MARGINS I WAS WONT TO NOTE EACH TORMENT GRIM THAT CRUSHED ME LIKE A VICE
WOULD GOD MOST BLESSED FATHER THAT IT MAY TURN OUT AS YOU SAY
BUT IF NOT HE DID NOT MIND AND ASCANIO SHOULD NOT WANT FOR CLOTHES
2 I REPLIED THAT I DESIRED NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE THAN TO COMPLETE THE BEAUTIFUL WORK I HAD BEGUN
EXAMINING THE SUBSTANCE WITH MY EYES I SAW THAT IT WAS SO
2 THE SORCERER ON HIS SIDE WENT ON URGING
AGNOLO IN TIME AND PLACE LIKE THIS WE MUST NOT YIELD TO FRIGHT BUT DO THE UTMOST TO BESTIR OURSELVES
WHEN I FELT HIM I WENT ALOFT AND NEVER STAYED FROM FIRING TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER
AND WHAT IS MORE I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT YOU COMMENDED ME HIGHLY WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED
THEN TURNING TO ALBERTACCIO HE SAID
FOR THOUGH THEY WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING IN THEIR OWN WAY I WISH TO KEEP BOTH SPACE AND WORDS FOR MY ART WHICH HAS BEEN MY CHIEF INDUCEMENT TO WRITE AS I AM DOING AND ABOUT WHICH I SHALL HAVE ONLY TOO MUCH TO SAY
TAKE THAT RING COWARD FROM YOUR FINGER AND MARRY HER THAT I MAY GET SATISFACTION FROM YOU AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO YOUR DESERTS. HE REPLIED AT ONCE
IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE WAS PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE WITH BOLDNESS AND DONNINO HAD NOT EVIDENCE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE ACCUSATION
AT THESE WORDS THE DUCHESS SMILED A LITTLE AND SAID
NOW I HAD OFFERED MY CRUCIFIX TO S
AT THAT TIME THE OUTER WALLS HAD NOT BEEN BUILT AROUND THE CASTLE
A JEWELLER FROM MILAN IN THE PAPAL SERVICE HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT WHEN THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN
I CARRIED THE WHOLE TO THE POPE WITH THE CHRIST IN WAX AND MANY OTHER EXQUISITE DECORATIONS WHICH GAVE HIM COMPLETE SATISFACTION
MY LADY I HAVE TAKEN IN HAND FOR MY PLEASURE ONE OF THE MOST LABORIOUS PIECES WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN PRODUCED
SO I ANSWERED
LVII WHILE THE WORKSHOP FOR EXECUTING MY PERSEUS WAS IN BUILDING I USED TO WORK IN A GROUND-FLOOR ROOM
I PROFESS MYSELF A CONNOISSEUR AND UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL INDEED. I REPLIED
HE SET IT UP IN HIS STUDY WHICH WAS VERY RICHLY ADORNED WITH ANTIQUITIES AND OTHER WORKS OF ART
THIS I DID
HOWEVER I PURSUED MY COURSE AS USUAL
AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN SOLD BY A VENETIAN CARDINAL UNDER PAPAL GUARANTEE FOR THE PRICE OF A BISHOPRIC THE POPE A ROMAN AND A FARNESE AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE SCRATCHED WITH IMPIOUS HANDS THE FACE OF THE MOST SACRED LAWS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOVERED ME
I WAS AHEAD OF THE WHOLE COMPANY AND WE WAITED TO SEE THE HORSE PLUNGE HEADLONG
ILL ADD NO MORE
THEY ARE GOOD NEWS I BRING
AFTER SETTING THINGS IN ORDER THERE I PROCEEDED TO THE OTHER LITTLE GATE OF ARNO WHERE I FOUND A CAPTAIN FROM CESENA THE MOST POLITE WELL-MANNERED MAN I EVER KNEW IN THAT PROFESSION
THEN I SET MY HAND ALSO TO A LARGE DIRK WHICH I ALWAYS WORE FOR MY DEFENCE AND CRIED OUT
THE PORTA CASTELLO WAS THE GATE CALLED AFTER THE CASTLE OF S
BUT SHE GETTING WIND OF THIS LEFT ROME SECRETLY ONE NIGHT AND WENT OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF NAPLES
SO I MADE BOTH DRAWING AND MODEL FOR THE PIECE
WE THEN SAT DOWN TOGETHER TO BREAKFAST
BISHOP OF FORLIMPOPOLI IN 1537 AND OF JESI IN 1540
THE NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT SLEEP AND I KEPT WEARYING FOR THE DAY IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT MY RESOLUTION
BENVENUTO IF ONE GAVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD YOU HAVE THE HEART TO FLY? I SAID IF HE WOULD SET ME AT LIBERTY I FELT QUITE UP TO FLYING DOWN TO PRATI AFTER MAKING MYSELF A PAIR OF WINGS OUT OF WAXED LINEN
ON MEETING WE MADE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE MOST PASSIONATE AFFECTION
ON THIS I WENT TO HIM WITHOUT THE PIECE
AND AFTER DIVIDING THE MONEY BETWEEN THE EIGHT OF US AND GIVING ME MY SHARE HE SAID TO ME
AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY THE DUCHESS WANTED ME TO PLACE THE MATTER IN HER HANDS
HOWEVER HE DID NOT COME TO VISIT ME THAT DAY
THE KNAVE ANSWERED
HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY GAVE ME NOTHING TO DO WHILE I WAS BRINGING TO PERFECTION ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT MASTER-PIECES EVER EXECUTED IN THIS WORLD
THOUGH I TOOK NOTICE OF THIS I PAID IT NO ATTENTION ONLY REMARKING THAT ALL THINGS ACTED AS THEIR NATURE PROMPTED
BUT I NOTICED A STONE JUST BENEATH THE DOOR WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO BE VERY FIRMLY FIXED
THEN I LOST ALL PATIENCE AND EXCLAIMED
XCIX ABOUT THIS TIME THE GREAT BLOCK OF MARBLE ARRIVED WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR THE NEPTUNE
1 WHEN HE SAW WHAT I WAS DOING HE USED FREQUENTLY TO EXCLAIM
DRAGGING MYSELF FROM THE MISERABLE LAIR IN WHICH I LAY I PUT SOME CLOTHES ON FOR IT HAD BEGUN TO BE COLD
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY MESSER BARTOLOMMEO CONCINO 1 ONE OF THE DUKES SECRETARIES AND AMONG THE CHIEFEST CAME TO ME AND SAID WITH SOMEWHAT OF A BULLYING AIR
NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY. AFTER THIS I SHUT MYSELF UP AT HOME WORKING DAY AND NIGHT NOT EVEN SHOWING MY FACE IN THE PALACE
NOW MY PIPE WHICH RUNS SIX CUBITS TO THE STATUES FOOT AS I HAVE SAID IS NOT THICKER THAN TWO FINGERS
BUT BEING NOT QUITE EASY THAT I MIGHT NOT BEGIN ANOTHER LECTURE SHARPER THAN THE LAST HE PRAISED MY MEDALS AND SAID THEY GAVE HIM THE GREATEST SATISFACTION BUT THAT HE SHOULD LIKE ANOTHER REVERSE MADE ACCORDING TO A FANCY OF HIS OWN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO STAMP THEM WITH TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS
WHAT I RETORTED IN WORDS WORTHY OF SUCH A RASCAL NEED NOT HERE BE REPEATED
NICHOLAS DE NEUFVILLE LORD OF VILLEROY
BUT WHEN TOBBIA CAME TO SHOW HIM WHAT HE HAD DONE HE WAS VERY DISCONTENTED AND GREATLY REGRETTED THAT HE HAD BROKEN WITH ME BLAMING ALL THE OTHER MANS WORKS AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAD INTRODUCED THEM TO HIM
CARDINAL CIBO WAS IN THE PRESENCE AND THE POPE NARRATED TO HIM THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MY DISPUTE WITH THE BISHOP
AT THE SAME TIME THEY TOOK GOOD CARE LEST THE DUKE SHOULD PERCEIVE WHAT THEY WERE AFTER
BUT NO SOONER HAD HE SEEN ME THAN HE SHOWED SIGNS OF SURPRISE AND INTIMATED THAT I MIGHT GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS
THEY ALSO TOLD THE SAME TO ME
THIS COMPELLED ME TO REST AWHILE AND I BATHED MY HANDS IN MY OWN URINE
MERCY MY FATHER
TAKING IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT I WAS JEERING HIM HE CRIED OUT
I PREFER TO DWELL ON MATTERS OF GREATER MOMENT
MY LORD THAT IS NOT MY NAME
BUT IF YOUR EXCELLENCY DEIGNS TO GRANT ME A FAVOUR WHICH IS WHOLLY BLAMELESS I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF IT
1 ACCORDINGLY I SET HAND WITH MARVELLOUS GOOD-WILL TO THIS PIECE OF PLATE AND WAS ACCOMMODATED WITH A PART OF HIS WORKSHOP BY A MILANESE NAMED MAESTRO GIOVAN PIERO DELLA TACCA
IN THE MEANTIME I USED TO GO EVERY DAY TO TAKE MY MUSIC LESSON AND IN A FEW WEEKS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THAT ACCURSED ART
YOUR HOLINESS WILL DO WELL SINCE YOU DO NOT CARE TO GIVE IT ME TO BESTOW IT ON A MAN OF TALENT WHO DESERVES IT AND NOT UPON SOME FAT IGNORAMUS WHO WILL SPEND HIS TIME SCRATCHING HIS PAUNCH IF I MAY QUOTE YOUR HOLINESS OWN WORDS
HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED UPON THE POPES TIARAS
LET US HASTE INSIDE AND PUT THE MONEY AWAY
HE EXACTED A FORMAL PROMISE TO THIS EFFECT AND BADE ME PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE I LEFT THE CITY
FOR HAD I DONE EVERY SIN IN THE WORLD I WAS YET IN PERFECT SAFETY IN HIS LITTLE CELL
FOR NOT MANY YEARS AGO A YOUNG MAN CALLED LUCA CELLINI A BEARDLESS YOUTH FOUGHT WITH A SOLDIER OF EXPERIENCE AND A MOST VALOROUS MAN NAMED FRANCESCO DA VICORATI WHO HAD FREQUENTLY FOUGHT BEFORE IN SINGLE COMBAT
SOFFIONI THE CANNON BEING LIKE TUBES TO BLOW A FIRE UP
WHILE I STOOD REVOLVING THESE THOUGHTS IN MY MIND I HELD IN MY HAND SOME FLIMSY PARTICLES OF THE REPUTED DIAMOND WHICH OF A TRUTH I FIRMLY BELIEVED TO BE SUCH
NEITHER THE NOTARY NOR ANY OTHERS WHO HEARD OF THE AFFAIR KNEW THAT HE WAS A RELATIVE OF THOSE TWO ROGUES
TURNING HIS FACE ROUND TO ME HE CALLED OUT THRICE-FAREWELL FAREWELL! AND WITH THE LAST WORD THAT MOST VALIANT SPIRIT PASSED AWAY
WE ENJOYED OUR MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP DURING ALL THE YEARS I STAYED IN PARIS AND OFTEN DID WE EXULT TOGETHER ON BEING ABLE TO ADVANCE IN ART AND KNOWLEDGE AT THE COST OF THAT SO GREAT AND ADMIRABLE PRINCE OUR PATRON EACH IN HIS OWN BRANCH OF INDUSTRY
THIS AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED
BUT AS HE TURNED ROUND VERY SUDDENLY THE BLOW FELL UPON THE POINT OF HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND BROKE THE BONE
NEVERTHELESS LIKE THE NOBLE SOUL HE WAS AND TRULY WORTHY OF HIS ROYAL STATION HE JUDGED RIGHTLY THAT THE CARDINAL HAD ACTED THUS IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR RATHER THAN FROM ANY CLEAR PREVISION OF DISTRESSED FINANCES IN SO VAST A REALM
I APPLIED MYSELF TO FINISHING HIS JEWEL
QUEL BENE MAY MEAN THE HAPPINESS OF HIS FRIENDSHIP NOTE 3
I TOLD HIM THAT THIS WAS THE SOLE DESIRE I HAD AND THAT IF I COULD BUT SEE THE SUN ONCE ONLY I SHOULD DIE CONTENTED
NOW WHEN I SAW HOW GREATLY THEY WERE TAKEN WITH THE PIECE I BEGAN TO THANK THEM WITH A TOUCH OF HUMOUR SAYING THAT IF THEY HAD NOT REFUSED ME THE MARBLE FOR THE NEPTUNE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE UNDERTAKEN SO ARDUOUS A TASK THE LIKE WHEREOF HAD NOT BEEN ATTEMPTED BY ANY SCULPTOR BEFORE ME. IT IS TRUE, I ADDED THAT THIS CRUCIFIX HAS COST ME HOURS OF UNIMAGINABLE LABOUR
UP WITH YOU
YOU MUST REMEMBER PRINCE THAT STATUES ON A LARGE SCALE ARE QUITE A DIFFERENT DISH OF SOUP FROM LITTLE FIGURES
I HAD ALREADY RIDDEN ABOUT TWO MILES AND DURING THAT SHORT TIME HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO REVISIT ANY OF THOSE PARTS WHERE I WAS KNOWN
I BEGGED HIM TO SEND ME WITH IT TO THE EMPEROR AS HE HAD PROMISED
HE DID SO BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE WAITED TILL THE MORNING THE DECEIT HE WISHED TO PRACTISE ON ME MUST HAVE FAILED
AS IT PLEASED GOD GIOVANNI NOTICED ONE OF THESE GIRLS WHO WAS NAMED ELISABETTA
HE MADE ME SHOW IT HIM AND PRAYED ME IF I PARTED WITH IT TO GIVE HIM THE REFUSAL
MADAME DETAMPES SAID BOLDLY
THE DUCHESS THEN SAID THAT EVEN AS SHE HAD PROTECTED HIM IN LIFE SO WOULD SHE PROTECT HIM IN THE GRAVE AND THAT ALBEIT HE WAS DEAD I NEED NEVER TRY TO GET THAT BLOCK OF MARBLE
YET WOULD TO GOD THAT I UNDERSTOOD SO NOBLE AN ART AS YOU ALLUDE TO
IT WAS BACCIO DAGNOLO WHO ALTERED BRUNELLESCHIS PLAN FOR THE CUPOLA
ALL THAT I HAVE WRITTEN IS THE PURE TRUTH
AROUND IT WERE SEVEN CIRCULAR PIECES ON WHICH WERE THE SEVEN VIRTUES CARVED AND JOINED OF IVORY AND BLACK BONE
AT DAYBREAK THEY BEGAN QUITE QUIETLY TO BREAK INTO THE PIT OF THE FURNACE
ONE SOLID AND ROUNDED LA ANIMA WHICH STOOD AT A SHORT INTERVAL WITHIN THE FORMER AND REGULATED THE INFLUX OF THE METAL
IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR ROMAN GENTLEMEN TO HIRE BRAVI FOR THE DEFENCE OF THEIR PALACES WHEN ANY EXTRAORDINARY DISTURBANCE WAS EXPECTED AS FOR EXAMPLE UPON THE VACATION OF THE PAPAL CHAIR
THE POPE IN CONSEQUENCE BEGAN TO REGARD ME WITH STILL GREATER FAVOUR BECAUSE HE SAW THAT I DISCHARGED MY FUNCTIONS AS INTELLIGENTLY AS THE TASK DEMANDED
FIRST IT SEEMS HE MADE A SOLID CLAY MODEL SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN THE BRONZE WAS MEANT TO BE
WHOEVER WANTED TO INJURE THIS MAN HAS DONE HIM A GREAT SERVICE
BUT SINCE I HAD NOT YET CONSTRUCTED MY OWN FURNACE I EMPLOYED THAT OF MAESTRO ZANOBI DI PAGNO A BELL-FOUNDER
HE GROOMED MY HORSE GARDENED AND SOON ESSAYED TO HELP ME IN THE WORKSHOP WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT BY DEGREES HE LEARNED THE ART QUITE NICELY
HE ONLY REPLIED WITH A SORT OF SMILE
AND THEY BELIEVING WHAT HE SAID JUMPED OUT AND DROVE THE DOG OFF WITH MUCH TROUBLE
I KNOW ALL THAT YOU WANT OF ME. MESSER RUBERTO PUCCI THEN BEGAN
BUT IF YOU WANT IT EARLIER I WILL ACT ACCORDING TO YOUR WISHES
HOWEVER I ENTIRELY DEFEATED BOTH THESE EXPECTATIONS
ONE OF YOU HAS HIS FIRST BEARD AND THE OTHER IS JUST GETTING IT
THIS BROUGHT ME TO THE POPES MIND AND HE SPOKE OF ME IN THE VERY HIGHEST TERMS ADDING THAT IF HE KNEW WHERE I WAS HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET ME BACK
THE FELLOW WHO WAS HAUGHTY BOLD AND SPIRITED REPLIED THAT HE MEANT TO DO JUST WHAT HE LIKED
I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ABSTAIN FROM HINTING WHAT I REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE STONE
WHEREUPON I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND WENT OFF WITH THEM WHILE MORE THAN AS MANY OF THE YOUNG MEN BORE ME COMPANY

4 NO ONE ELSE HAD BEEN TO ME OF ANY GOOD
THEY MADE AS THOUGH THEY WOULD RESORT TO VIOLENCE
THAT I SHOULD RUN MY HEAD AGAINST A WALL IF I PRESUMED TO OPPOSE HIM AND THAT VILLEROIS HAD GIVEN HIM AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT HE WAS DOING
UPON WHICH HE WAS SEIZED WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO COME
THIS WAS FRANCESCO BROTHER TO CARDINAL MARCO CORNARO
THIS WAS FRANCESCO BROTHER TO CARDINAL MARCO CORNARO
THESE WERE THE CAUSES OF MY HAVING THERE PRODUCED SO MANY MASTERPIECES IN SO SHORT A SPACE OF TIME
HE DIED IN 1566
UPON WHICH I MADE NEW DESIGNS ACCORDING TO MY OWN CONCEPTION AND ACCORDING TO THE IDEAL OF ART
I WAS GREATLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY ONE PARTICULAR ANNOYANCE
AND WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE ABLE TO STRIKE THE BEAUTIFUL DIES WHICH YOU HAVE MADE FOR ME? THEN I SAID
I MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED FREE OF EXPENSE WITH THE CARDINAL OR WITH THAT OTHER TRAIN OF HIS BUT I CHOSE TO TAKE MY OWN WAY BY MYSELF
LVII WHEN THE POPE TOOK HIS JOURNEY TO BOLOGNA HE LEFT CARDINAL SALVIATI AS LEGATE OF ROME AND GAVE HIM COMMISSION TO PUSH THE WORK THAT I WAS DOING FORWARD ADDING
AFTER A FEW DAYS I FINISHED MY MODEL AND TOOK IT TO THE POPE ONE MORNING WHEN MESSER TRAIANO MADE ME WAIT TILL HE HAD SENT FOR MICHELETTO AND POMPEO BIDDING THEM MAKE HASTE AND BRING THEIR DRAWINGS
IT TOOK ME EIGHT DAYS TO COMPLETE HIS LIKENESS
A VILLAGE IN THE CASTENINO
FOR THE STONE WAS AN EMERALD OF SUCH GOOD COLOUR THAT THE MAN WHO BOUGHT IT FROM ME FOR TENS OF CROWNS SOLD IT AGAIN FOR HUNDREDS AFTER SETTING IT AS A FINGER-RING
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD GIVEN MY PAROLE TO THE CASTELLAN WHO WAS SUCH A WORTHY MAN AND HAD DONE ME SUCH KIND OFFICES
LX ABOUT THIS TIME BERNARDONE BALDINI 1 BROKER IN JEWELS TO THE DUKE BROUGHT A BIG DIAMOND FROM VENICE WHICH WEIGHED MORE THAN THIRTY-FIVE CARATS
SO I REINED IN FOR A MOMENT WHILE A SHOWER OF HAIL BEGAN TO FALL WITHOUT A DROP OF WATER
I MEAN MYSELF TO GO ABOUT A MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS WITHOUT YOU WHICH FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE HAD IT IN MY MIND TO DO. OUR ROOM ADJOINED THAT OF THE SECRETARY
BATTISTA SAVELLI OF A GREAT ROMAN HOUSE WAS A CAPTAIN OF CAVALRY IN THE PAPAL SERVICE AFTER 1530
O BENVENUTO
O BENVENUTO
O BENVENUTO
THEN I AIMED TO STRIKE HIM IN THE FACE
YOU MAY CUT HIM TO PIECES BUT HE WILL CERTAINLY KILL A LOT OF YOU AND PERHAPS WILL ESCAPE YOUR HANDS AFTER DOING ALL THE MISCHIEF HE IS ABLE. SO MATTERS CALMED DOWN
BUT THEY BADE ME NOTE WELL THAT NOTE 2
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU CHOOSE AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU. I REPLIED
HAVING TAKEN BACK THE STONE I OFFERED IT AGAIN TO HIS EXCELLENCY ADDING THAT THE DIAMOND AND I WERE AT HIS SERVICE
FOR WHEN I SET DIES FOR THE MINT EACH MORNING BEFORE DINNER I PUT AT LEAST THREE CROWNS INTO MY POCKET
MY NAME IS WELCOME
I HAVE SEEN THE NECKLACE AND THEY DO NOT PLEASE ME. THEN I ADDED
XCIII WHEN TWO MORE DAYS HAD PASSED AND THE CHORUS OF PRAISE WAS EVER ON THE INCREASE I RESOLVED TO GO AND PRESENT MYSELF TO THE DUKE WHO SAID WITH GREAT GOOD-HUMOUR
HE SAID THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THIS
I SAID THAT MY INDISPOSITION WOULD FURNISH A SOUND EXCUSE SINCE HIS MAJESTY SEEING HOW THIN AND PALE I WAS WOULD VERY READILY BELIEVE AND ACCEPT IT
LET ME INFORM YOUR SACRED MAJESTY, I THUS BEGAN THAT THE WHOLE OF THIS MODEL IS SO EXACTLY MADE TO SCALE THAT IF IT SHOULD COME TO BEING EXECUTED IN THE LARGE NONE OF ITS GRACE AND LIGHTNESS WILL BE SACRIFICED
I WOKE HIS COURAGE UP AND HE AND I ALONE TOGETHER SLEW SO MANY OF THE ENEMIES THAT THE SOLDIERS TOOK ANOTHER ROAD
I AM THAT MAN. ON THIS I RAISED MY HAND STRUCK HIM IN THE FACE AND SAID
TAKE THE LAD BACK COURAGEOUSLY AND I WILL COME WITH YOU. I HAD PREPARED MYSELF AND WAS PACING UP AND DOWN THE SHOP WAITING FOR THE BELL TO VESPERS
MY NOBLEMAN WAS ATTENDED BY THIRTY BRAVE FELLOWS ALL WELL ARMED
AFTER THE THUNDER THE HEAVENS MADE A NOISE SO GREAT AND HORRIBLE THAT I THOUGHT THE LAST DAY HAD COME
NAY INDEED I HAD TURNED MY BACK ON HIM
LXXII I HAD IT BROUGHT AT ONCE IN TO MY STUDIO AND BEGAN TO CHISEL IT
I KEEP HER PRINCIPALLY FOR MY ARTS SAKE SINCE I CANNOT DO WITHOUT A MODEL
1 TOGETHER WITH THE CHIMæRA A NUMBER OF LITTLE STATUETTES LIKEWISE IN BRONZE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT
THEN I SET MYSELF TO COUNTERFEIT THESE HEADS AND PLACE THEM ON THE HOLDFASTS
YOU ARE THE MAN WHO HAD ME OUSTED FROM MY PLACE AT THE PALACE PAYING ME BACK WITH THAT BLACK INGRATITUDE WHICH IS THE USUAL RECOMPENSE OF GREAT BENEFITS
BUT LET THE REST OF HIS LIFE BEAR WITNESS HOW VIRTUOUSLY I HAVE BROUGHT HIM UP
WHEREUPON SERRISTORI MEETING ME ONE MORNING AFTER THEY HAD COME OUT UPON THE PIAZZA DELL ANNUNZIATA CRIED ALOUD WITHOUT THE LEAST REGARD TO CONSEQUENCES
THINKING OF THE GRIEF WHICH MY GOOD FATHER MIGHT BE FEELING FOR ME I WROTE HIM THAT I WAS SOJOURNING WITH A VERY EXCELLENT AND HONEST MAN CALLED MAESTRO ULIVIERI DELLA CHIOSTRA AND WAS WORKING WITH HIM AT MANY GOOD THINGS OF BEAUTY AND IMPORTANCE
UPON ADVANCING FARTHER I DISCOVERED THAT THE OTHER HEAD THAT NAMELY OF PERSEUS HAD SUCCEEDED NO LESS ADMIRABLY
CONSIDER THEREFORE WHETHER I COULD HAVE CROSSED THE FRONTIER WITH THOSE THREE GREAT VASES WHICH TOGETHER WITH THEIR CASES WERE A WHOLE MULES BURDEN
HE IS AS GOOD AS HE IS HANDSOME. I HAD BY THIS TIME ACQUIRED A TRIFLE OF ASSURANCE MIXED HOWEVER WITH SOME HONEST BASHFULNESS
HE CURSED HIS ART AND THOSE WHO TAUGHT IT HIM VOWING THAT THENCEFORTH HE WOULD NEVER WORK AT LARGE PLATE BUT GIVE HIS WHOLE ATTENTION TO THOSE BROTHEL GEWGAWS SINCE THEY WERE SO WELL PAID
THEN WE MOUNTED TWO HORSES WHICH WERE WAITING THERE FOR US AND WENT BY NIGHT TO SIENA
ARCHBISHOP OF MILAN AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN
HE WROTE WELL WAS GRACEFUL IN MANNERS AND OF SURPRISING PERSONAL BEAUTY
TO COSIMO DE MEDICI
I AM CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY CAUSE OF THIS GREAT TROUBLE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO ME IS CARDINAL SALVIATI
II IN ADDITION TO THESE THINGS THE CARDINAL ORDERED ME TO MAKE THE MODEL FOR A SALT-CELLAR
THE BYSTANDERS OPENLY DECLARED AGAINST HIM HOLDING HIM FOR A LOUT AS INDEED HE WAS AND ME FOR A MAN AS I HAD PROVED MYSELF
FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF POPE GIULIOS ILLUSTRIOUS MEMORY WHO CONFERRED AN OFFICE OF THE SAME KIND UPON BRAMANTE THAT MOST ADMIRABLE ARCHITECT. IMMEDIATELY ON FINISHING THIS SPEECH I MADE MY BOW AND WENT OFF IN A FURY
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN THE CORSICAN SHOWED THAT HE HAD NOT PLUCK ENOUGH TO DO THE BUSINESS AS HE PROMISED SIGNOR PIER LUIGI ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY GAVE ORDERS TO HAVE ME TAKEN MERELY TO STOP THE MOUTH OF POMPEOS DAUGHTER WHO WAS ALWAYS CLAMOURING TO KNOW WHERE HER DOWER HAD GONE TO
IN HIS HAND FOR INSTANCE HE HELD A LASH WITH THREE BALLS ATTACHED TO CHAINS
AFTERWARDS I TOOK A WALK THROUGH VICCHIO--THE MARKET HAD JUST OPENED--AND NOTICED HOW ALL THE INHABITANTS FIXED THEIR EYES UPON ME AS ON SOMETHING STRANGE
MY FATHER WHO WAS ALSO IN THE HOUSE RAN UP WHEN HE HEARD MY SCREAMS AND IN HIS STUPEFACTION COULD NOT THINK HOW TO PREVENT THE VENOMOUS ANIMAL FROM KILLING ME
NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH I KEPT MY CONSCIOUSNESS A TERRIBLE OLD MAN USED TO COME TO MY BEDSIDE AND MAKE AS THOUGH HE WOULD DRAG ME BY FORCE INTO A HUGE BOAT HE HAD WITH HIM
BELOW THIS GODDESS IN THE PART WHICH REPRESENTED EARTH I COLLECTED THE FAIREST ANIMALS THAT HAUNT OUR GLOBE
BUT SHE REMAINED AN UNACCOUNTABLY LONG TIME ABSENT
FOR THESE DESERTS THEN HE TOLD DUKE ALESSANDRO THAT I HAD ABUSED HIS EXCELLENCY AND HAD BRAGGED I MEANT TO BE THE FIRST TO LEAP UPON THE WALLS OF FLORENCE WITH HIS FOES THE EXILES
WHEN I COULD RAISE MY HEAD A LITTLE FROM THE BOLSTER WHICH WAS AT THE END OF FIFTEEN DAYS ALTHOUGH I WAS UNABLE TO WALK UPON MY FEET I HAD MYSELF CARRIED TO THE PALACE OF THE MEDICI AND PLACED UPON THE LITTLE UPPER TERRACE
5 WHO SHALL MATTIO YIELD OUR PAIN RELIEF
THEY WERE DISBANDED IN MARCH 1527
WE CHOOSE TO HAVE IT SO. I REPLIED THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE SO AND THAT I DID NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE IT SO
IN SUCH MATTERS ONE IS ALWAYS CERTAIN TO LOSE WHILE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE GAINED. HIS FATHER SPOKE TO LIKE PURPOSE
THE NAME OF CESANO IS WELL KNOWN IN THE LITERARY CORRESPONDENCE OF THOSE TIMES
ON THE INSTANT I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND ASKED IF HE BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TIDINGS
I TOO HAVE COME TO ANGER WITH MY MOTHER
ANGELO
ANGELO
ANGELO
ANGELO
ANGELO
I THINK THAT IT EXCEEDED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DUCATS OF THE CAMERA
WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THE MATTER AND SAW NOT HOW TO FLY I DID MY BEST TO CROUCH INTO THE HEDGE
FOR IT IS CUSTOMARY IN FRANCE TO HAVE BUT ONE GODFATHER AND TWO GODMOTHERS
FRANCESCO PENNI SURNAMED IL FATTORE AIDED RAPHAEL IN HIS ROMAN FRESCOES AND WAS MUCH BELOVED BY HIM
THEN HE COMMANDED ME TO MAKE THE MODEL FOR A BROAD DOUBLOON OF GOLD UPON WHICH HE WANTED A NAKED CHRIST WITH HIS HANDS TIED AND THE INSCRIPTION ECCE HOMO THE REVERSE WAS TO HAVE A POPE AND EMPEROR IN THE ACT TOGETHER OF PROPPING UP A CROSS WHICH SEEMED TO FALL AND THIS LEGEND
2 WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE CARDINAL WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME POPE LEO RECEIVED MY FATHER VERY KINDLY
CONSEQUENTLY ALTHOUGH I KNEW I SHOULD NOT GET THE MARBLE FOR THE REASONS ABOVE NARRATED I HOPED TO HAVE IT SOON COMPLETED AND TO DISPLAY IT ON THE PIAZZA SIMPLY FOR MY SATISFACTION
ON HEARING THESE WORDS HE JUMPED UPON A WINDOW-SEAT IN THE HALL THERE AND DEFIED ME TO REPEAT WHAT I HAD SAID
THIS LED ME TO CHOOSE THE ATTITUDE WHICH MAY BE NOTICED IN MY STATUE AVOIDING THE HOLES AND KEEPING MY FIGURE FREE FROM THEM
LITTLE BY LITTLE I FELT MY VITAL FORCES WANING UNTIL AT LAST MY VIGOROUS TEMPERAMENT HAD BECOME ADAPTED TO THAT PURGATORY
AND THIS TOGETHER WITH THE ATTENTIONS OF THOSE TWO RASCALS DISPOSED ME TO SET OUT ONE WEDNESDAY WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A DOUBLE HOLIDAY FOR MY COUNTRY-HOUSE AT TRESPIANO
THE CARDINAL DE MEDICI WENT TO ROME AND WAS ELECTED POPE AGAINST THE EXPECTATION OF EVERYBODY
THEREFORE YOU ARE BUT LOSING YOUR TIME AND TROUBLE. THEY REPLIED THAT IF THEIR WORK PROVED A FAILURE THEY WOULD PAY BACK THE MONEY I HAD GIVEN ON ACCOUNT AND RECOUP ME FOR CURRENT EXPENSES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SHE PAID ME EVERY KIND ATTENTION WHICH WAS POSSIBLE
RECOMMEND YOUR SOUL TO GOD FOR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN. WITHOUT BUDGING FROM HIS SEAT HE CALLED THREE TIMES
ALL WITH ONE VOICE CONTENDED WHICH SHOULD PRAISE IT MOST
THE BEAST WAS CAPITAL AS A RETRIEVER SINCE HE BROUGHT ME EVERY SORT OF BIRDS AND GAME I SHOT BUT HE ALSO SERVED MOST ADMIRABLY FOR A WATCHDOG
HAVING AT THIS TIME WORKED WITH MANY DIFFERENT PERSONS IN FLORENCE I HAD COME TO KNOW SOME WORTHY MEN AMONG THE GOLDSMITHS AS FOR INSTANCE MARCONE MY FIRST MASTER
XXVII IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AT THIS PERIOD AN ACTION WAS BROUGHT AGAINST ME IN PARIS BY THE SECOND LODGER I HAD OUSTED FROM MY CASTLE WHO PRETENDED THAT ON THAT OCCASION I HAD STOLEN A LARGE QUANTITY OF HIS EFFECTS
IF HE HAD THE LEAST THING TO COMPLAIN OF FROM THOSE BRUTES OF FRENCHMEN HE WAS TO LET ME HEAR AT ONCE BECAUSE I WOULD TAKE POST AND FLY FROM ANY PLACE IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF NOT ONLY TO DISCHARGE THE GREAT OBLIGATIONS UNDER WHICH I LAY TO THAT GOOD KING BUT ALSO TO DEFEND MY HONOUR
AND FROM MESSER LORENZO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT HE IS PREPARING AN ADMIRABLE REVERSE FOR THAT MEDAL WHICH YOU WANT TO MAKE. I HAD LEFT FULL DIRECTIONS TO PETRO PAGOLO THE ROMAN ABOVE MENTIONED HOW HE HAD TO USE THE DIES
AFTERWARDS WHEN YOU HAVE CONFESSED AND COMMUNICATED YOU SHALL PRESENT YOURSELF TO ME AGAIN AND IT WILL BE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. WHEN I PARTED FROM THE POPE MESSER GIACOPO AND THE ARCHBISHOP APPROACHED AND THE POPE SPOKE TO THEM IN THE HIGHEST TERMS IMAGINABLE ABOUT ME
AND ON MY FURNISHING HIM WITH DETAILS HE LISTENED AS ATTENTIVELY AND GRACIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE
WITH THIS IN MY HAND THEN I ANNOUNCED MY PRESENCE TO HER NURSE AND SHOWED THE GIFT WHICH I HAD BROUGHT HER MISTRESS
I VALUED IT AT 800 CROWNS
THE YOUNG MAN TOOK MY REFUSAL OF THIS MISERABLE VEST SO ILL THAT HE TOLD ME HE WANTED TO GO HOME TO TAGLIACOZZO
AND ALL THIS WHILE I POINTED MY ARTILLERY BY DAY UPON THE PLACES WHERE MISCHIEF COULD BE DONE
I HAVE THOUGHT IT BEST TO TRANSLATE THE PHRASE LITERALLY
IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE COURTESIES I ALWAYS TOOK HIM FROM THE INN TO LODGE WITH ME WHEN HE CAME INTO FLORENCE OFTEN INVITING A RELATIVE OR TWO WHO HAPPENED TO ATTEND HIM
1 WANTING TO MAKE USE OF HIS LODGING I TURNED HIM OUT BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TROUBLE
I ENTERED THE SERVICE OF YOUR EXCELLENCY AS SCULPTOR GOLDSMITH AND STAMPER OF COIN
AT LEISURE WE SHALL HEAR IF WHAT YOU SAY IS SO. THEN PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE ME HEARING I ADDED
WE HAVE COME TO SEE YOU I AND BENVENUTO WHOM I LOVE LIKE MY OWN BROTHER
AND BEING INTIMATE WITH MY MASTER HE DAILY VISITED HIS HOUSE
THIS SCHOOL WAS THE COLLEGIO DEI MAESTRI DI BELLE ARTI IN FLORENCE WHO HAD HITHERTO KNOWN OF CELLINI MAINLY AS A GOLDSMITH
I SPRANG UPON THE GUNWALE AND HIT HIM SUCH A BLOW THAT IF HE HAD NOT TUMBLED BACKWARD I MUST HAVE PIERCED HIS BODY
HIS BROTHER NICKNAMED IL GATTA, WAS A CLEVER CLERK BUT HAD SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY IN MANAGING THE PROPERTY OF TOMMASO GUADAGNI A VERY WEALTHY MERCHANT
AND WHEN I NOTICED THAT I SET ABOUT TO DO MY UTMOST BY MYSELF ALONE
HE HAD FLUNG HIMSELF UPON A SETTEE AND WAS SLEEPING
HERE NEVER LANGUISH HONEST MEN AND TRUE EXCEPT BY PLACEMENS FRAUD MISGOVERNMENT JEALOUSIES ANGER OR SOME SPITEFUL CREW
HE CAME TO ROME IN 1517 WAS SHUT UP WITH CLEMENT IN THE CASTLE OF S
HIS BURLESQUE CAPITOLI ARE PRINTED WITH THOSE OF BERNI AND OTHERS
IN FORMER YEARS I KEPT THE FEAST AMONG THE PLEASURES AND THE FRAILTIES OF THE WORLD
BERTINO ALDOBRANDI WAS LIFTED FROM THE GROUND SERIOUSLY INJURED
AND I MAY OBSERVE THAT IF YOUR EXCELLENCY DOES NOT GIVE IT TO THE SCULPTOR WHO DESERVES IT THIS WILL NOT WRONG THE MAN SO MUCH BUT WILL REFLECT GREAT DISCREDIT UPON YOURSELF SINCE THE LOSS AND SHAME WILL FALL ON YOU
I EXCLAIMED THAT IF THE DUKE GAVE ME TEN THOUSAND CROWNS I SHOULD NOT BE PAID ENOUGH AND THAT IF I HAD EVER THOUGHT THINGS WOULD COME TO THIS HAGGLING I SHOULD NOT HAVE SETTLED IN HIS SERVICE
I DID THIS FOR THE BEST
IO ALI POSSA SOFFIARE IN CULO NOTE 5
FROM THEM I LEARNED THAT THE CLAY WAS GOOD ENOUGH BUT HAD NOT BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD BY DONATELLO INASMUCH AS I COULD SEE THAT HIS PIECES HAD BEEN CAST WITH THE VERY GREATEST TROUBLE
I WELL REMEMBER TO HAVE INSPECTED ALL THE BEST WORKS AND BY THE GREATEST MASTERS OF ALL ITALY BUT I NEVER SET MY EYES ON ANYTHING WHICH STIRRED ME TO SUCH ADMIRATION. THESE WORDS THE KING ADDRESSED IN FRENCH TO THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WITH MANY OTHERS OF EVEN WARMER PRAISE
THEN I TURNED TO ALESSANDRO AND CECCHINO AND BADE THEM DISCHARGE THEIR ARQUEBUSES SHOWING THEM HOW TO AVOID BEING HIT BY THE BESIEGERS
WE WILL TRAVEL BACK TOGETHER! AND CONSIDERED THE AFFAIR SETTLED
THEN I SENT IT INTO FRANCE ADDRESSED TO THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA
BY COLOSSUS CELLINI MEANS THE FOUNTAIN WITH THE GREAT STATUE OF MARS
NOW THIS FELLOW HAD SOME SONS OF VERY BAD MORALS AND REPUTE
ACCORDING TO ONE READING THE SENSE WOULD BE
MY LORD YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY OUGHT NOW TO EMPLOY ANOTHER ADMIRABLE DEVICE
THEN HE INTRODUCED US INTO THE CIRCLE WHICH HE HAD RECONSTRUCTED WITH ART MORE ADMIRABLE AND YET MORE WONDROUS CEREMONIES
WHEN WE WERE AT TABLE SHE SAT BETWEEN ME AND BACHIACCA
VILLEROIS FROM WHOM THE ORDER PASSED TO M
I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW MESSER FRANCESCO THAT I COULD SAY MUCH WHICH WOULD PROVE IRREFRAGABLY AND MAKE YOU ADMIT THAT SUCH WAYS OF ACTING AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED AND USED ARE NOT IN VOGUE AMONG RATIONAL ANIMALS
AND COMMANDED THE TREASURER TO PRESENT ME WITH A DIAMOND UP TO THREE HUNDRED CROWNS IN VALUE
I VERILY BELIEVE THAT A FINER DOOR COULD NOT BE MADE FOR PARADISE ITSELF. WHEN HE HAD CEASED SPEAKING ALTHOUGH HIS SPEECH HAD BEEN ENTIRELY IN MY FAVOUR I AGAIN THANKED HIM RESPECTFULLY REPEATING HOWEVER MY REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO TRAVEL
ON REACHING FLORENCE I ONLY STOPPED TO DRAW OFF MY RIDING-BOOTS AND HURRIED TO THE PALACE
NOW THE NECROMANCER BEGAN TO UTTER THOSE AWFUL INVOCATIONS CALLING BY NAME ON MULTITUDES OF DEMONS WHO ARE CAPTAINS OF THEIR LEGIONS AND THESE HE SUMMONED BY THE VIRTUE AND POTENCY OF GOD THE UNCREATED LIVING AND ETERNAL IN PHRASES OF THE HEBREW AND ALSO OF THE GREEK AND LATIN TONGUES
FANCY ONE HUNDRED FOR EACH SEPARATE ILL
THE OTHER TWO OF US HAD TO LOOK AFTER THE FIRE AND THE PERFUMES
THATS THE WAY TO TREAT COWARDLY THIEVES OF YOUR SORT; AND WHEN THEY WANTED TO MAKE A MOVE UPON ME TRUSTING TO THEIR NUMBERS I WHOSE BLOOD WAS NOW WELL UP LAID HANDS TO A LITTLE KNIFE I HAD AND CRIED
LET YOUR HANDS DECLARE WHAT MAN YOU ARE. HE GAVE ME A VERY FINE PIECE OF SILVER PLATE TO WORK ON FOR A CARDINAL
ANGELO IN 1527 AND DIED IN 1529 AFTER HIS RETURN TO SPAIN
THIS WAS THE CASTLE OF LE PETIT NESLE ON THE SITE OF WHICH NOW STANDS THE PALACE OF THE INSTITUTE
NICCOLò REMIND HIS EXCELLENCY THAT POPE CLEMENT WANTED TO DO AS MUCH TO ME BEFORE AND QUITE AS UNJUSTLY
I HAVE SEEN OF HIS SOME PAXES IN HALF RELIEF AND SOME CHRISTS A PALM IN LENGTH WROUGHT OF THE THINNEST GOLDEN PLATES SO EXQUISITELY DONE THAT I ESTEEMED HIM THE GREATEST MASTER IN THAT KIND I HAD EVER SEEN AND ENVIED HIM MORE THAN ALL THE REST TOGETHER
PLANT THIS PEAR IN YOUR GARDEN. TO THESE WORDS I REPLIED WITH A DELIGHTED GESTURE
HE BORE THE ASPECT OF DIVINE BENIGNITY WITH SUCH FAIR GRACE THAT THE MIND OF MAN COULD NOT CONCEIVE THE THOUSANDTH PART OF IT
HE BORE THE NAME OF M
2 MY RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN IN AN INSTANT
AND THENCE HAVING PERFORMED MY DEVOTIONS PURSUED THE JOURNEY TO ROME
BENVENUTO YOU WOULD DO BETTER TO REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE. I ANSWERED THAT I WANTED BY ALL MEANS TO REGAIN MY HOLD ON ROME
MY LORD THIS EXACTLY ILLUSTRATES THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE SO OFTEN TOLD YOUR EXCELLENCY
CONSEQUENTLY WHILE THE POPE WAS THERE THE PRISONERS USED TO BE SHUT UP WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS
BELOW THE DIAMOND I HAD PLACE THREE CHILDREN WHO WITH THEIR ARMS UPRAISED WERE SUPPORTING THE JEWEL
AND AS GOD WILLED IT I HAVE BESTOWED MY GIFT AND LABOUR UPON ONE WHO IS FAR MORE WORTHY OF THEM
AND WHEN I WANTED TO GIVE SECURITY FOR LEAVE TO WALK ABOUT THE CASTLE HE REPLIED THAT THOUGH HE COULD NOT TAKE THAT SEEING THE POPE SET TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE UPON MY AFFAIR YET HE WOULD FRANKLY TRUST MY WORD BECAUSE HE WAS INFORMED BY EVERY ONE WHAT A WORTHY MAN I WAS
IF THOSE WINDOWS WERE ABOVE INSTEAD OF BENEATH THE WHOLE COLLECTION WOULD SHOW TO GREATER ADVANTAGE AND YOUR PORTRAIT PLACED AMONG SO MANY MASTERPIECES WOULD HOLD ITS OWN WITH CREDIT. NO SOONER HAD MICHEL AGNOLO LEFT THE HOUSE OF BINDO THAN HE WROTE ME A VERY KIND LETTER WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS
DURING THE FOLLOWING DAYS AFTER LEAVING SOLOSMEO AT HIS WORK IN MONTE CASSINO I CAME ONE MORNING TO BREAKFAST AT THE INN OF ADANAGNI
AND IF I AM DISCOVERED I RUN RISK OF BEING CUT TO PIECES
I HAVE ALSO THE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN YOU BECAUSE I OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE PIOUS AND RELIGIOUS WHICH IS A THING THAT PLEASES ME
AND BOTH WERE INTENDED FOR THE COUNCIL-HALL IN THE PALACE OF THE SIGNORY
BENVENUTO IS A FELLOW WHO ESTEEMS HIS OWN GREAT TALENTS BUT SLIGHTLY AND US LESS
2 THAT PRINCE COMMISSIONED ME TO MAKE A MODEL FOR A RELIQUARY TO HOLD THE BLOOD OF CHRIST WHICH THEY HAVE THERE AND SAY WAS BROUGHT THEM BY LONGINUS
ON HIS SAYING YES THE POPE TOLD HIM TO FOLLOW IT OUT EXACTLY
HE CAME TO MY SHOP AND COMMISSIONED ME TO MAKE A GOLDEN MEDAL TO BE WORN IN THE HAT
LXXI NOT MANY DAYS HAD PASSED BEFORE MY MEDAL BEING FINISHED I STAMPED IT IN GOLD SILVER AND COPPER
FRANZESI WAS A CLEVER ITALIAN POET
THESE WORDS I REPEATED TO THE POPE ASKING HIM IF HE WISHED ME TO DELIVER THEM IN THAT WAY
WHEREFORE I BEGAN TO MURMUR AND COMPLAIN INDIGNANTLY CURSING THE UNHAPPY DAY WHICH BROUGHT ME TO FLORENCE
THE RESULT WAS THAT AT THE END OF FIFTY DAYS I WAS CURED AND AS SOUND AS A FISH IN THE WATER
THAT IS A BRAVE FELLOW AND HIS EXPLOIT IS SOMETHING MARVELLOUS
SO I BEG YOU MY DEAR BENVENUTO TO PRAISE THEM TO HIM AS HIGHLY AS YOU CAN. AT THESE WORDS I DISCLOSED MY MIND TO THE DUCHESS WITH ALL THE RESPECT I COULD AND ANSWERED
THAT IS THE PANTHEON
I HAD ALSO ACCUSTOMED MY YOUNG MEN TO CARRY SHIRTS OF MAIL AND HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THE ROMAN WHO WHILE WE WERE IN ROME TOGETHER HAD NEVER LEFT IT OFF SO FAR AS I COULD SEE
A PUPIL OF ANDREA DEL SARTO WHO WENT WITH HIM TO FRANCE AND SETTLED THERE
4 IF TO THE HOSPITAL I COME AND FAIR FIND THE ANNUNZIATA LIMNED
YET IN AN EVIL HOUR HE SENT ME STONES SAND AND LIME ENOUGH TO BUILD PERHAPS A PIGEON-HOUSE WITH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT
IT WAS BUILT IN A TRIANGLE RIGHT UP AGAINST THE CITY WALLS AND WAS OF SOME ANTIQUITY BUT HAD NO GARRISON
FRANCESCO DA SAN GALLO THE SCULPTOR CALLED IL MARGOLLA GOT THE GATE OF SANTA CROCE
IN THIS WAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE FAR BETTER WHO DESERVES THE COMMISSION
THEREFORE I APPEAL TO YOU FOR JUSTICE. THESE WORDS I REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE CONTINUALLY CALLING OUT
THERE WAS NO MOONSHINE BUT THE LIGHT OF A FAIR OPEN HEAVEN
WHY DO YOU ASK ME? BECAUSE MY LORD ON SUCH A DAY AT SUCH AN HOUR IN A CORNER OF MERCATO NUOVO ANTONIO LANDI THE SON OF VITTORIO BEGGED ME TO INDUCE YOUR EXCELLENCY TO BUY IT AND AT MY FIRST QUESTION HE ASKED 16,000 DUCATS FOR THE DIAMOND
QUANTO PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO READ QUANDO-WHEN NOTE 4
I WILL TELL YOU WHY I DO NOT CARE ANY LONGER TO LOOK AT VASES
THEN I FOUND COMFORT AND FELL PRESENTLY ASLEEP
AND MUTTERING THREATS BETWEEN MY TEETH I TOOK MYSELF OFF NOT WITHOUT GREAT INWARD SATISFACTION
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE HEARD NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THIS? HE THEN INFORMED ME THAT THE MAN HAD KEPT IT VERY DARK AND HAD OBTAINED THE KINGS COMMISSION WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SINCE HIS MAJESTY AT FIRST WOULD NOT CONCEDE IT
NEXT THERE IS SOMETHING IN ITSELF THAT WILL MAKE YOU RIGHT ELOQUENT A BOLD BRAVE SPARK BIG WITH HIGH-SOARING THOUGHTS FOR GOOD AND ILL
THE LITTLE HUSSY AND HER MOTHER FELL TO WEEPING WHILE I SHOUTED TO THE JUDGE
BUT NOW I TURNED BACK BURNING WITH FURY AND MEANING TO PLAY MY PART THIS TIME IN EARNEST
THE CARDINAL ANSWERED THAT IT WAS FAR BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL THE KING SHOULD THINK OF IT HIMSELF AND THAT I OUGHT TO SHOW MYSELF AT TIMES TO HIS MAJESTY WHILE HE WAS AT TABLE
NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOW WHAT STUFF WE ARE MADE OF
THIS VERSION IS IN ISO LATIN1 WITH 8 BIT ACCENTS AND IS ALSO SUPPLIED IN A SINGLE FILE HTML VERSION
SHE THEN DESIRED ME TO FASTEN IT UPON HER BREAST AND HANDED ME A LARGE PIN WITH WHICH I FIXED IT AND TOOK MY LEAVE IN HER GOOD FAVOUR
CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE DUKE HE BEGAN THUS
AND AS FOR DYING I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT DIE I MUST
BENVENUTO THIS DIAMOND IS WORTH TWO THOUSAND DUCATS MORE THAN WITH THE FOIL OF MILIANO. I REJOINED
I HAVE BROUGHT FROM ITALY THE GREATEST MAN WHO EVER LIVED ENDOWED WITH ALL THE TALENTS. NOTE 1
THE SILVER AND EVERYTHING PERTAINING TO THEM NOTE 2
AND TWO OF MY SERVANTS HAVING MADE ME COMFORTABLE FOR THE NIGHT WENT TO SLEEP IN THE ANTECHAMBER
HE COLLECTED THE REMNANTS OF THE BANDLE NERE AND GAVE THEM OVER TO ORAZIO BAGLIONI WHO CONTRIVED TO ESCAPE FROM S
I WENT ON TREATING MYSELF ACCORDING TO THEIR METHODS BUT DERIVED NO BENEFIT
SO THEN ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS HAVING OBSERVED HIM PAY ME SOME REMARKABLE ATTENTIONS I ENTERED INTO THE AFFAIR OF SBIETTA AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
I MUST BEG YOU TO EXCUSE ME FOR I CANNOT SUP WITH YOU
HE TOLD ME TO HAVE NO FEAR
WHILE I WAS ENGAGED IN DOING THIS IT CROSSED MY MIND THAT EXACTLY ON THAT VERY SPOT I HAD ASSASSINATED POMPEO
THIS ANIMAL HAD BEEN LENT ME FOR THE JOURNEY TO LYONS BY THE BISHOP OF PAVIA WHO WAS NOW ONCE MORE INSTALLED IN MY CASTLE
NOW IN ADDITION TO THE DEEDS OF CONTRACT I HAD A DECLARATION WRITTEN BY SBIETTAS OWN HAND IN WHICH HE BOUND HIMSELF BEFORE WITNESSES TO PAY ME OVER THE YEARLY INCOME I HAVE MENTIONED
LEANING THERE AGAINST THE BATTLEMENTS THE UNHAPPY MAN COULD SEE HIS POOR HOUSE BEING SACKED AND HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN OUTRAGED
THOUGH THE WORKS HE HAD COMMISSIONED WERE NOT YET BEGUN. BUT THIS INVOLVES AN AWKWARD USE OF THE WORD DIPOI XLVII AFTER RETURNING TO HIS PALACE HE CALLED TO MIND THE WORDS I HAD SPOKEN IN OUR PREVIOUS INTERVIEW SOME OF WHICH WERE SO EXCESSIVELY HUMBLE AND OTHERS SO PROUD AND HAUGHTY THAT THEY CAUSED HIM NO SMALL IRRITATION
THEN I TURNED TO THEM AND SAID
UN DI QUELI ARROVELLATI SCOTENDO LA CRESTO DELLO ARRONZINATO CAPPUCCIO SEE ABOVE P
THEN SHE BADE ME ASK FOR MY REWARD WHATEVER I LIKED
WHY DOES NOT THE MAN COME FORWARD WHO HAS TO PRONOUNCE MY DOOM? THE GUARD REPLIED
THIS MADE MY YOUNG MEN AND ATTENDANTS ESPECIALLY FELICE KEEP THE SECRET OF THE SHEETS IN ALL LOYALTY
BUT ON THIS POINT THE POPE TOOK ADVICE AND THEN TOLD ME I MUST FIRST OBTAIN PARDON FOR THE HOMICIDE AND THIS I SHOULD GET AT THE HOLY MARIES DAY IN AUGUST THROUGH THE CAPORIONI OF ROME
I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE THE MONEY SO I SENT IT BACK TO HIM BY THE SAME HAND SAYING AT A LATER TIME TO BINDO
I WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE WORK
BUT WE SAW THE GALLEYS SETTING OUT TO SEA
THEN I MADE MY SUIT TO HER AND PRAYED HER TELL THE DUKE THAT I WAS GETTING SMALL ASSISTANCE FOR SO GREAT A WORK
INSOMUCH THAT IN A SHORT SPACE OF TIME THE WHOLE COLISEUM WAS FULL OF A HUNDREDFOLD AS MANY AS HAD APPEARED UPON THE FIRST OCCASION
SHE WAS BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND OF A BRUNETTE COMPLEXION
BUT THE THORNS PRICKED AND HURT ME GOADING ME TO MADNESS LIKE A BULL
MORE THAN THREE LONG HOURS PASSED AND YET I DID NOT REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS
SIGNOR ORAZIO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED GENERAL OF THE FLORENTINES
TAKE BACK YOUR JEWELS BENVENUTO
WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD DISCHARGE THE DEBT BY MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF THREE CROWNS
E PRIMATICCIO
WHEN THE SUN APPEARED ABOVE OUR HORIZON HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
THEN HE BEGAN TO FUMBLE WITH HIS FINGERS AT THEM AND HAVING FELT THEM A SHORT WHILE HE FETCHED A DEEP SIGH AND SAID TO HIS ATTENDANTS THAT HE WAS MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT ME BUT THAT IF GOD GAVE HIM BACK HIS HEALTH HE WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT
BESIDES ONE HAD TO CONSIDER THAT I HAD PUT A VEIL UPON MY STATUE TO CONCEAL ITS FAULTS
ON THIS I SUDDENLY GAVE UP ALL WISH TO GO BACK TO HIM
THE CLEOPATRA IS THAT RECUMBENT STATUE OF A SLEEPING ARIADNE OR BACCHANTE NOW IN THE VATICAN
XLIX I OBEYED THE CARDINAL AND RETURNED TO PARIS WHERE I MADE EXCELLENT CASES FOR MY THREE SILVER VASES AFTER THE LAPSE OF TWENTY DAYS I BEGAN MY PREPARATIONS AND PACKED THE THREE VASES UPON A MULE
THIS THING IS NOT LIKE THE MINT WHICH IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO TAKE AWAY
THE OTHER ASKED MINE HOW IT HAD HAPPENED WITH HER AND WHO WERE HER FRIENDS AND HOW LONG SHE HAD BEEN SETTLED IN ROME AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE KIND
BUT HE NEVER HIT IT
ONCE NOTWITHSTANDING I TOOK AND PROPPED A WOODEN POLE I FOUND THERE IN POSITION LIKE A TRAP
BUT SINCE THE WALL ENDED IN A SHARP RIDGE I HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO DRAG THE POLE UP AFTER ME
SO WHILE HE WENT ON BULLYING I TUCKED THE PIECE BENEATH MY CAPE AND MUTTERED UNDER MY BREATH
AND I BEGAN TO COMPOSE MY FOILS
YOU COWARDS DO YOU NOT OBSERVE HOW THOSE FOUR GENTLEMEN HAVE TAKEN BOAT BEFORE US AND ARE GOING ON THEIR WAY WITH LAUGHTER
THE DUKE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS REALLY GOING SAID NOTHING FURTHER
FROM THE COMMENCEMENT TO THE MIDDLE AND THE ENDING EVERYTHING THAT I HAD DONE HAD BEEN PERFORMED TO MY GREAT DISADVANTAGE
HE ACQUIRED GREAT WEALTH AND HONOUR AT THE COURT OF DUKE COSIMO AND WAS GRANDFATHER OF THE NOTORIOUS MARéCHAL DANCRE
AND IF IT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR FEET THAT YOU SHIRK THE JOURNEY WE WILL FIND A RETURN HORSE FOR ROME WHICH WILL DEPRIVE YOU OF THE EXCUSE. ACCORDINGLY I HIRED A HORSE
THEN SHE SAID THAT I HAD VERY NEARLY HIT THE MARK AND ASKED ME WHETHER I FELT CAPABLE OF SETTING THE STONES REALLY WELL
MY POOR AFFLICTED FATHER WENT TO THE EIGHT THREW HIMSELF UPON HIS KNEES AND PRAYED FOR MERCY FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNG SON
HE HELD NAPLES AGAINST ORAZIO BAGLIONI IN 1528 AND DIED BEFORE SPELLO IN 1529
MY FATHER TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING HIM WITH SOME MEANING WORDS IN ORDER TO MARK HIS REVENGE RELYING ON THE FAVOUR WHICH ORAZIO BAGLIONI SHOWED ME
I CONTRACTED CLOSE FRIENDSHIP WITH SIGNOR GABBRIELLO CESERINO AT THAT TIME GONFALONIER OF ROME AND EXECUTED MANY PIECES FOR HIM
HE THEN INQUIRED WHAT METHODS I SHOULD USE
COULD YOU KNOW WHAT RAGE CAME OVER ME WHEN FOR SUCH ROGUES THE JAIL RELAXED HER HOLD
MY FATHER IN THOSE TIMES FASHIONED WONDERFUL ORGANS WITH PIPES OF WOOD SPINETS THE FAIREST AND MOST EXCELLENT WHICH THEN COULD BE SEEN VIOLS AND LUTES AND HARPS OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT CONSTRUCTION
AND AS YOUR HOLINESS KNOWS THAT I AM DILIGENT IN MY ART I BEG THAT I MAY BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF IT. THE POPE REPLIED
MY FATHER WOULD NOT LET HIM GIVE ME WAGES LIKE THE OTHER APPRENTICES
O GOD OF HEAVEN
I TOLD THE STORY TO THE COUNT
ON ARRIVING AT THE OPENING OF THE STREET WHICH LEADS TO SANT AGNOLO I TURNED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF SAN PIERO
GIOVANNI NEVER ENTERED MY PRISON WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING OFFENSIVE TO ME
A THOUSAND CROWNS, I ANSWERED
MY LORD THIS ONLY GRIEVES ME THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY IS LOSING A SERVANT THAN WHOM YOU MAY PERCHANCE FIND MEN MORE VALIANT IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS BUT NONE MORE LOVINGLY AND LOYALLY DEVOTED TO YOUR SERVICE THAN I HAVE BEEN. THE DUKE BADE HIM DO ALL HE COULD TO KEEP ALIVE
THE YOUTH HAD NO ACQUAINTANCES AND WAS THEREFORE QUITE UNKNOWN
THESE FOUR ARE PRECIOUS STONES AND THESE IT IS QUITE RIGHT TO PURCHASE. WHEN I HAD THUS SPOKEN THE DUCHESS SHOWED SOME SIGNS OF IRRITATION AND EXCLAIMED
MY SKILL IN USING THE SWORD MADE THEM THINK I WAS A SOLDIER RATHER THAN A FELLOW OF SOME OTHER CALLING
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS CHAPTER OPENS THE IMPERIALIST ARMY UNDER THE CONSTABLE OF BOURBON WAS MARCHING UPON ROME IN 1527
TO PLEASE MY FATHER I WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND PLAYED THE CORNET AND THE FLUTE WITH ONE OF HIS BROTHERS WHO WAS NAMED GIROLAMO SEVERAL YEARS YOUNGER THAN THE SAID PIERO A VERY WORTHY YOUNG MAN AND QUITE THE CONTRARY OF HIS BROTHER
GIVING ME LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION MEANWHILE TO HIS AMBASSADOR AVERARDO SERRISTORI
THE WOMAN AFTERWARDS TOLD ME THAT ONLY MY SISTER LIPERATA HAD ESCAPED AND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH A PIOUS LADY NAMED MONA ANDREA DE BELLACCI
THIS RAISED HIS HOLINESS TO A HIGH PITCH OF MERRIMENT AND GLADNESS ALL THE MORE BECAUSE HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DRINK FREELY ONCE A WEEK AND WENT INDEED TO VOMIT AFTER HIS INDULGENCE
WHEN WE CAME TO THE CAMOLLIA GATE I AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE POSTMASTER BY THE INDICATIONS GIVEN ME
OTHERWISE WE MUST BE ENEMIES
ANOTHER POINT HATH PASSED INTO MY MIND WHICH IVE NOT TOLD THEE LUCA
TO INCREASE MY ANXIETIES THE WORKSHOP TOOK FIRE AND WE WERE AFRAID LEST THE ROOF SHOULD FALL UPON OUR HEADS
SO I REMAINED THERE UNDER GUARD
AT THAT TIME THE BARGELLO ARRIVED WITH A LARGE PART OF HIS GUARD AND HAD ME REPLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH BROUGHT ME ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO THE PRISON
1 IT WAS BUONARROTIS HABIT TO BANTER ALL WHO WERE DRAWING THERE
YOU WILL REMEMBER MY LORD THAT THE MARBLE WHICH BANDINELLO USED FOR HIS HERCULES AND CACUS WAS QUARRIED FOR OUR INCOMPARABLE MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI
THE MAN EXCUSED HIMSELF BY SAYING THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO IN THE FACE OF THE SAFE-CONDUCT WHICH I HELD
IN WHOSE HANDS HAVE I LEFT MY PROPERTY MY CASTLE
SO HO
AH UNHAPPY MAN
I ANSWERED THAT HE NEED NOT TAKE THOUGHT FOR A PAIR OF LITTLE STRAPS SINCE I COULD MAKE HIM AS MANY BIG ONES AS HE LIKED
I REPLIED THAT IF SHE WAS DISPOSED TO COME WITH ME I WOULD GIVE UP TO HER KEEPING THE TWO HUNDRED DUCATS I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE VICEROY
MOST BLESSED FATHER FROM THE TIME OF THE SACK UP TO THIS HOUR I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONFESS OR TO COMMUNICATE BECAUSE THEY REFUSE ME ABSOLUTION
I LEFT THE HINGES ATTACHED TO THEIR DOOR-POSTS AT TOP AND BOTTOM BY MEANS OF SOME OF THE SAME NAILS THAT I HAD DRAWN
IT WILL BE ENOUGH IF I PARTAKE OF IT BY THE DIVINE VIRTUE OF THE EYESIGHT WHEREBY IT SHALL BE TRANSMITTED INTO MY IMMORTAL SOUL WHICH ONLY PRAYS TO HIM FOR MERCY AND FORGIVENESS. HAVING SPOKEN THUS THE HOST WAS ELEVATED
BENVENUTO IS THE GLORY OF OUR ART AND IT IS ONLY DUE THAT WE SHOULD DOFF OUR CAPS TO HIM AND TO HIS FOILS. THEN GAIO SAID
SO PRITHEE TAKE THEM TO THE DUKE AND PRAISE THEM UP TO THE SKIES
THE SOLE CAUSE OF MY MISFORTUNE WAS THAT I SINNED BY TAKING A LITTLE BROTH THIS MORNING HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO BREAK MY FAST WITH. IN SPITE OF THE GREAT PERIL WE WERE IN WE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING A LITTLE AT THE DONKEY AND HIS SILLY SPEECHES
WE MUST DO SOMETHING TO HELP THIS LEG FOR I DONT KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT LONGER. THE GOOD FELICE WITHOUT A WORD LEAPT FROM HIS HORSE AND GATHERING SOME THISTLES AND BITS OF STICK BEGAN TO BUILD A FIRE
NOR DID HE CEASE ONCE ALL THAT NIGHT UNTIL THE DAY BROKE
WHILE THE FURNACE WAS WORKING I NEVER LEFT OFF WATCHING HOW TO ANNOY OUR ENEMIES
SIR COME UP BUT COME ALONE AND THEN COME AS YOU LIKE. THE GENERAL WHO WAS A MAN OF MIGHTY PRIDE STOOD STILL A MOMENT AND THEN SAID ANGRILY
SOULS LIVELY GRACEFUL LIKE TO GODS BELOW
THEY MEANWHILE CONTINUED LOADING ME WITH COMPLIMENTS UNTIL AT LAST I PRAYED THEM FOR KINDNESS SAKE TO LEAVE THE PIAZZA IN MY COMPANY BECAUSE THE FOLK WERE STOPPING AND STARING AT ME MORE THAN AT MY PERSEUS
OH IF YOUR HOLINESS HAS PARDONED HIM AND SET HIM FREE AT MY DISPOSAL WHAT WILL THE WORLD SAY OF YOU AND ME? THE POPE ANSWERED
GOOD SIR YOU KNOW ME
THEN AFTER GIVING ME ANOTHER SHARP REBUKE THEY SENT US TO THE CHANCELLOR
THOUGH I CALL THEM SATYRS THEY SHOWED NOTHING OF THE SATYR EXCEPT LITTLE HORNS AND A GOATISH HEAD
ILL SEND YOU TO A GALLEY AND THEN PERHAPS YOULL HAVE THE GRACE 2 TO GO ON WITH YOUR LABOUR. THE BESTIAL MANNERS OF THE MAN MADE ME A BEAST TOO
NOW IN THE UFFIZZI
THROUGH HIM WHO HEARD THY PSALM THOSE FOES SHALL PERISH EACH AND ALL IN STRIFE WHILE THOU REMAINEST HAPPY FREE AND CALM BLESSED BY OUR SIRE IN HEAVEN ON EARTH FOR LIFE! NOTE 1
I NEVER SPEAK ABOUT HIM AND THE BEAST IS PERPETUALLY CAUSING ME ANNOYANCE
WHEN HE SAW THE EFFECT HIS TALENTS HAD PRODUCED UPON MY MIND HE THOUGHT OF YET ANOTHER METHOD
AID FROM THE DUKE OF URBINO 1 NEVER CAME
AND THOUGH HE TOOK THE THIRD PART OF MY GAIN SINCE I WAS A JOURNEYMAN FOR SUCH IS THE CUSTOM OF THE TRADE TWO-THIRDS FALL TO THE WORKMAN AND ONE-THIRD TO THE MASTERS OF THE SHOP YET INCONSIDERATE ENVY HAD MORE POWER IN HIM THAN AVARICE
YET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE HAD MET WITH ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR EXECUTION
GO AND GIVE BACK TO BERNARDONE WHAT YOU HAVE OF HIS
HE SENT FOR ME AND ASKED ABOUT IT
NOW HIS POST AT COURT GAVE HIM AUTHORITY WITH THE CHIEF-CONSTABLES AND ALL THE OFFICERS IN THE POOR UNHAPPY TOWN OF FLORENCE
IT SO HAPPENED ON ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS WHILE I WAS GETTING SOME LITTLE CHISELS INTO TRIM TO WORK ON THE NARCISSUS THAT A VERY FINE SPLINTER OF STEEL FLEW INTO MY RIGHT EYE AND EMBEDDED ITSELF SO DEEPLY IN THE PUPIL THAT IT COULD NOT BE EXTRACTED
HE CONTINUED TO PERSUADE ME BY ARGUING THAT LATIN SCHOLARSHIP WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE AND THAT IF HE WANTED HE COULD HAVE FOUND PLENTY OF GOOD LATINISTS
HOWEVER TO PREVENT YOUR THINKING THAT I WANT TO SAVE MYSELF THE TROUBLE OF SO SLIGHT A MATTER I WILL GLADLY SKETCH YOU SOMETHING
HE SPRANG UP DROPPED HIS SWORD HALF-STUNNED WITH THE GREAT PAIN AND TOOK TO FLIGHT
SUCH AN EVENT AS THE SACK OF ROME IS DESCRIBED BECAUSE BENVENUTO HIMSELF FOUGHT IN IT
THEN AFTER SHEDDING SOME TEARS FOR FATHER SISTER HUSBAND AND A LITTLE SON WHOM SHE HAD LOST SHE BEGAN TO GET THE SUPPER READY
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PIECES OF EVIDENCE REGARDING WHAT WENT ON INSIDE THE CASTLE DURING THE SACK OF ROME
IN HIS ABSENCE I AM OBLIGED TO ACT FOR HIM. WE ALL BEGGED HIM TO STAY BUT COULD NOT ALTER HIS DETERMINATION
ON EVERY DAY THAT FOLLOWED THE CASTELLAN SENT TO KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING AND SAYING
YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO EXECUTE A SALT-CELLAR AND VASES AND BUSTS AND DOORS AND A HEAP OF OTHER THINGS WHICH QUITE CONFOUND ME WHEN I CONSIDER HOW YOU HAVE NEGLECTED MY WISHES AND WORKED FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF YOUR OWN
ALBEIT YOUR RAYS MAY BLIND ME I DO NOT WISH TO LOOK ON ANYTHING AGAIN BUT THIS! SO I STAYED AWHILE WITH MY EYES FIXED STEADILY ON HIM
BUT I BELIEVE I CAUGHT IT FROM THAT FINE YOUNG SERVANT-GIRL WHOM I WAS KEEPING WHEN MY HOUSE WAS ROBBED
MEANWHILE THE NOBILITY OF ROME YOUNG OLD AND ALL SORTS CAME TO VISIT ME
UPON THIS FEELING MYSELF STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THAT DEVIL OF A FRIAR I RESPONDED THAT I ALWAYS MADE A PRACTICE OF PROMISING IN WORDS LESS THAN I COULD PERFORM IN DEEDS
AMONGST OTHERS TO THE MOST EXCELLENT DUKE OF FERRARA AND PRETENDED THAT HE HAD GOT THEM FROM A GREAT LORD IN ROME BY TELLING THIS NOBLEMAN THAT IF HE WANTED TO BE CURED HE MUST GIVE HIM THOSE TWO VASES
THIS EXPEDIENT SUCCEEDED AND EVERY ONE COULD NOW PERCEIVE THAT MY BRONZE WAS IN MOST PERFECT LIQUEFACTION AND MY MOULD WAS FILLING
NAY I CANNOT REMEMBER A DAY IN MY WHOLE LIFE WHEN I DINED WITH GREATER GLADNESS OR A BETTER APPETITE
THE LATTER WAS A SOLDIER AND BOZZA A SERVING-MAN
THEN HE BADE ME TAKE IT BACK TO MY HOUSE SAYING HE WOULD TELL ME AT THE PROPER TIME WHAT I SHOULD HAVE TO DO WITH IT
THOSE WORDS ARE NOT MEANT FOR WELL-DOERS
ANGELO AND SENT AS HOSTAGE TO THE IMPERIAL ARMY
DO YOU THINK HE IS THE DEVIL THAT SO MANY OF US SHOULD BE AFRAID OF HIM
UPON THIS THE DUKE BEGAN SPEAKING TO THE DUCHESS AND SAID
THE MATTER WAS AT ONCE REPORTED TO THE POPE WHO CRIED IN A GREAT FURY
AND THE OLD MAN THEIR LEADER SAID TO ME
I WAS AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH
FOR BOTH REASONS I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK ALTHOUGH I TOLD THE DUKE POLITELY THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY ORDERED
BENEATH HER WERE THE HANDSOMEST LIVING CREATURES WHICH THE EARTH PRODUCES
WELL AFTER THE DEED WAS DONE HE CAME TO FIND ME AND I SAID TO HIM
SOME HAVE EVEN BEEN KNOWN TO GIVE A LAWSUIT IN DOWRY WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS TO MEN WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OUT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS
BENVENUTO BEGIN SOME CONVERSATION WITH ME ON A SUBJECT WHICH SHALL SEEM IMPORTANT AND DO NOT STOP TALKING SO LONG AS THE MARQUIS REMAINS IN THIS ROOM. THEN HE TOOK TO WALKING UP AND DOWN AND THE OCCASION MAKING FOR MY ADVANTAGE I WAS VERY GLAD TO DISCOURSE WITH HIM UPON THE METHODS I HAD USED TO TINT THE STONE
AFTERWARDS I PUT ON THE CLAY AND WHEN THAT WAS MODELLED BAKED IT
NEXT THEY HAVE BUCKLED SPURS UPON HIS HEELS AND PUT THE BRIDLE FREELY IN HIS HANDS AND TURNED HIM OUT UPON A MAGNIFICENT FIELD FULL OF FLOWERS AND FRUITS AND ALL DELIGHTFUL THINGS
A FLORENTINE BANISHED IN 1530 FOR HAVING BEEN IN ARMS AGAINST THE MEDICI
103
THEN THEY BEGAN TO MAKE EXCUSES CRYING
NICCOLò DE PERICOLI A FLORENTINE WHO GOT THE NICKNAME OF TRIBOLO IN HIS BOYHOOD WAS A SCULPTOR OF SOME DISTINCTION
I WAS COMPLETELY CLOTHED IN MAIL WITH BIG BOOTS AND A GUN IN MY HAND
HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS ENGAGED UPON THE FABRIC OF S
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW THE HUSBAND OF MY SISTER ARRIVED
HE ANSWERED ON THE INSTANT
I THEN ADDRESSED MYSELF TO THE TASK OF EXPOSITION
CELLINI REFERS TO THE RENEWAL OF HOSTILITIES IN MAY 1542
UPON THE PLINTH I INTRODUCED FOUR LITTLE ROUND BALLS OF HARD WOOD MORE THAN HALF HIDDEN IN THEIR SOCKETS LIKE THE NUT OF A CROSSBOW
VAS ELECTIONIS THIS PIECE OF MONEY GAVE FAR MORE SATISFACTION THAN THE MODELS OF MY COMPETITORS
BANDINELLO RECEIVES TWO HUNDRED CROWNS A YEAR
MY LADY AND SOLE MISTRESS I HAVE NO OTHER DESIRE THAN TO SERVE YOU LOYALLY AND WITH THE STRICTEST OBEDIENCE
THEREFORE I GLADLY PRESENT IT TO YOU AS A GIFT. 1 AFTER SPEAKING TO THIS EFFECT I PRAYED THEM BEFORE THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE TO DEIGN TO FOLLOW ME INTO THE GROUND-FLOOR OF MY DWELLING
BUT AS IT WAS A VERY DELICATE AFFAIR HE NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN EMPLOYING THEM
THEN I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAID I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO DO SO WHEN I HAD RECEIVED THE MONEY
AND INDEED THE TORRE DI NONA WAS A SUSPICIOUS PLACE IT BEING ONE OF THE WORST CRIMINAL PRISONS IN ROME
MARK THIS FOR I AM CERTAIN OF IT THAT ON THE DAY OF ALL SAINTS THE DAY UPON WHICH I WAS BORN IN 1500 ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER AT FOUR HOURS AFTER NIGHTFALL ON THAT DAY WHICH IS COMING YOU WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD ME FROM THIS GLOOMY DUNGEON
AND YET HE WANTED ME TO RETURN IF ONLY THIS COULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT WITHOUT CONCESSIONS ON HIS PART
NOW TAKE CARE OF YOUR BENVENUTO FOR HE IS CURED
IT IS ONLY OWING TO MY INTELLIGENT INSIGHT INTO MEANS AND APPLIANCES THAT THE STATUE TURNED OUT AS IT DID
AND WHEN THEY STILL HEARD NOTHING HE PULLED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER BY THE ARM TILL HE ROUSED THEM AND BARKING FURIOUSLY RAN BEFORE TO SHOW THEM WHERE HE WANTED THEM TO GO
I HAD MADE AND WAS MAKING SOME THINGS FOR HIM WHICH HAD BROUGHT US WELL ACQUAINTED
THE DUKE MADE ANSWER HALF IN ANGER
THEN I WENT TO VISIT MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI AND REPEATED WHAT I HAD WRITTEN FROM FLORENCE TO HIM IN THE DUKES NAME
AND THERE I WENT TO SEE IT
I HAVE A GOOD MIND NOT TO COME UP AGAIN AND TO DO QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT WHICH I INTENDED TOWARD YOU. I REPLIED THAT JUST AS I WAS PUT THERE TO DEFEND MY NEIGHBOURS I WAS EQUALLY WELL ABLE TO DEFEND MYSELF TOO
MESSER GABRIELLO CESANO WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE AS UGLY AND DISPLEASING AS THE OTHER WAS AGREEABLE
IF I HAD OFFERED SOME TRIFLING OPPOSITION THE FELLOW WOULD NOT HAVE INSTALLED HIMSELF AS HE HAD DONE
THE PASTE MY HURRYING THOUGHTS COULD HARDLY FLOAT
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT COMPANION
THEIR ADVERSARY IF HE NEGLECT TO PRODUCE AS MANY ON THE OTHER SIDE BEING PERHAPS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CUSTOM IS CERTAIN TO HAVE THE VERDICT GIVEN AGAINST HIM
BUT IT WAS THE YOUNG ROMAN MACARONI WHO FIRST PUT HEART INTO THE COMPANY
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WAS COMPOSED BETWEEN 1558 AND 1566 BUT IT BRINGS THE RECORD DOWN ONLY TO 1562
WE HAD I MUST ADMIT THE MOST CAPITAL BEDS NEW IN EVERY PARTICULAR AND AS CLEAN AS THEY COULD BE
ALL THESE THINGS I BEHELD ACTUAL CLEAR AND VIVID AND KEPT RETURNING THANKS TO THE GLORY OF GOD AS LOUD AS I WAS ABLE
IO CHE NON POTEVO STARE ALLE MOSSE XXXIX AFTER I HAD MELTED DOWN THE GOLD I TOOK IT TO THE POPE WHO THANKED ME CORDIALLY FOR WHAT I HAD DONE AND ORDERED THE CAVALIERINO TO GIVE ME TWENTY-FIVE CROWNS APOLOGISING TO ME FOR HIS INABILITY TO GIVE ME MORE
SO NOTICING THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT ILL IF I SPOKE THE TRUTH I MADE MY MIND UP TO UPHOLD HIM IN HIS FALSE OPINION AND HANDING BACK THE DIAMOND SAID
IT SEEMS THAT BY ISCONTRO CELLINI MEANT VISCOUNT
THE MASTER OF THE WARDROBE WAS AT THAT TIME GIOVANNI ALEOTTI
YOU WILL HAVE HAD A LESSON FOR NEXT TIME. BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE
WAR HAD BROKEN OUT IN 1521 BETWEEN CHARLES V AND FRANCIS I WHICH DISTURBED ALL EUROPE AND INVOLVED THE STATES OF ITALY IN SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS
SO THEN MY BENVENUTO YOUR GOOD LOOKS DID NOT DECEIVE ME AS A LETTER FROM YOUR FATHER WHICH HAS COME INTO MY HANDS GIVES ME ASSURANCE WHICH PROVES HIM TO BE A MAN OF NOTABLE HONESTY AND WORTH
1 AND WHILE WE WERE EXCHANGING COMPLIMENTS THE DIAMOND WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED CAUGHT HIS EYE
IT WAS A COMMISSION FROM A MAN CALLED RAFFAELLO LAPACCINI
I SHALL NOT FAIL BY NIGHT OR DAY TO THINK AND DO EVERYTHING I CAN IN THE POPES SERVICE
I AM VERY SORRY THAT THE MONEY WAS SO LITTLE
DONT SEND FOR ME AGAIN FOR I WONT APPEAR NO NOT IF YOU SUMMON ME BY THE POLICE. AFTER THIS THE GOOD CARDINAL TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO LET ME KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO GO ON WORKING AND TO BRING HIM WHAT I WAS DOING TO LOOK AT
I MAY ADD THAT DURING THE TIME OF THAT STRICT ABSTINENCE I PRODUCED FINER THINGS AND OF MORE EXQUISITE INVENTION THAN AT ANY OTHER PERIOD OF MY LIFE
HE MARVELLED TO FIND HOW MANY PIECES I HAD ADVANCED AND WITH WHAT EXCELLENT RESULTS
I BEGAN TO CONSIDER THAT THE ANGEL OF MY VISION SPOKE THE TRUTH
IN REPLY I NARRATED THE WHOLE STORY OF THE NEPTUNE AND THE FOUNTAIN AND THE GREAT WRONG DONE ME BY THE DUCHESS
BUT I EXPLAINED MY REASONS SO FULLY AND CLEARLY THAT THE CARDINAL PERCEIVED MY DRIFT
HE RELATED THE MATTER TO THE CARDINAL AND PAINTED ME AS BLACK AS THE DEVIL IN HELL
WHAT IS IT THOU HAST DEIGNED THIS DAY TO SHOW ME! WHILE I WAS GAZING AND EXCLAIMING THUS THE CHRIST MOVED TOWARD THAT PART WHERE HIS RAYS WERE SETTLED AND THE MIDDLE OF THE SUN ONCE MORE BULGED OUT AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE
THIS WAS ONE OF THE THREE COUNCILS CREATED BY CLEMENT VII
WHILE THEN THE DUKE WAS INSPECTING AMMANATOS MODEL I RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE THAT HE SEEMED BUT LITTLE PLEASED WITH IT
THIS IS THE COUNTERSIGN OF MY DELIVERANCE! THEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT A PERSON OF MUCH INTELLIGENCE BEGAN TO SAY
THE KING WHO WAS EXCEEDINGLY GENEROUS REPLIED
BUT I TOLD THEM HOTLY THAT I WAS QUITE ABLE TO CONDUCT MY QUARRELS TO AN END BY MYSELF AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF STOUTER FIGHTERS THAN I WAS
AND THIS HE DID
AFTERWARDS WHEN WE REGAINED OUR INN WE FOUND LAMENTONE THERE
AND IF I HAD CASH ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TO ROME I WOULD NOT TURN BACK TO LOCK THE DOOR OF THAT WRETCHED LITTLE WORKSHOP I CALL MINE. TO THESE WORDS I REPLIED THAT IF THAT WAS ALL THAT KEPT HIM IN FLORENCE I HAD MONEY ENOUGH IN MY POCKETS TO BRING US BOTH TO ROME
LXVI I NOW STAYED AT HOME AND WENT RARELY TO THE PALACE LABOURING WITH GREAT DILIGENCE TO COMPLETE MY STATUE
HOWEVER HE KEPT PASSING SOMETIMES IN FRONT AND SOMETIMES BEHIND PERPETUALLY REPEATING THAT HE WOULD HAVE US STOP AT HIS HOSTELRY
THAT IS DIEGO FROM WHOM UNTIL THIS DAY I NEVER ASKED FOR ANY KIND OF FAVOUR
THE THOUGHT GAVE SATISFACTION AND SEVERAL PERSONS HAVE SINCE AVAILED THEMSELVES OF MY DEVICE
YET IT STRUCK ME THAT HE EXPOSED HIS OWN MIND TOO MUCH
WHEN I HAD EXPLAINED MY CAUSE TO THE MAGISTRACY THEY ALL WITH ONE VOICE RULED THAT SBIETTA SHOULD GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY EXCEPT FEDERIGO DE RICCI WHO WAS THEN EMPLOYING THE FELLOW HIMSELF
I ANSWERED THAT I BEGGED HIS HOLINESS TO LET ME BREATHE A LITTLE AFTER THE GREAT ILLNESS I HAD SUFFERED AND FROM WHICH I WAS NOT AS YET WHOLLY FREE ADDING THAT I WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT ALL THE HOURS IN WHICH I COULD WORK SHOULD BE SPENT IN HIS SERVICE
TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS CATARACTS FELL ON BOTH MY EYES
WHAT FOLLOWS HAS BEEN SO CAREFULLY ERASED POSSIBLY BY CELLINIS OWN HAND IN THE AUTOGRAPH THAT IT IS ILLEGIBLE
HOWEVER WE PASSED ONWARD TO THE PRESENCE OF THE RASCALLY PRIEST WHO SPOUTED OUT A TORRENT OF SUCH LANGUAGE AS ONLY PRIESTS AND SPANIARDS HAVE AT THEIR COMMAND
I HAD TO JOIN THE PIECES
THE NURSE MADE HER REPORT IN FULL TO MADAME WHO RETORTED SCORNFULLY
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE SENT FOR ME AT HIS DINNER-HOUR
NOTE 9
NOTE 9
AT LAST I RESOLVED TO MAKE OFF DREADING TO TEMPT MY EVIL FORTUNE LEST THIS SHOULD BRING ME TO THE GALLOWS
YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE ACCOMPANYING EMBLEMS INDICATE PHILOSOPHY AND HER ATTENDANT BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
THIS WAS AFTER I HAD LAIN FOUR MONTHS UPON MY BACK IN BED WITH MY LEG BROKEN AND HAD SO OFTEN DREAMED THAT ANGELS CAME AND MINISTERED TO ME THAT AT THE END OF THOSE FOUR MONTHS THE LIMB BECAME AS SOUND AS THOUGH IT NEVER HAD BEEN FRACTURED
PLEASE TO REFLECT THAT THE FRENCH ARE PEOPLE OF NO CULTURE AND WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE EXCELLENCE OF BENVENUTOS WORK
THIS CROWN HAD A CROSS UPON ONE SIDE WITH SOME LITTLE CHERUBIM AND ON THE OTHER SIDE HIS EXCELLENCYS ARMS
PAULINO WITH THE GRACE AND BEAUTY WHICH BELONGED TO HIM SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
IT CHANCED THAT JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET WE MET
ON ANOTHER OCCASION I LODGED MESSER LUIGI ALAMANNI AND HIS SONS FOR SOME MONTHS
CELLINI CALLS THESE PLATES BANDELLE CIX WELL TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF MY BED
THE PROCURATOR-FISCAL WAS THEN BENEDETTO VALENTI
THEY SAY THAT DURING THAT FAINTING-FIT I FLUNG MYSELF ABOUT AND CAST BAD WORDS AT MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI TO WIT THAT HE CAME TO ROB ME AND NOT FROM ANY MOTIVE OF CHARITY AND OTHER INSULTS OF THE KIND WHICH CAUSED HIM TO BE MUCH ASHAMED
YET WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT HE NEVER TOOK ANY DECIDED PART IN POLITICS AND BELONGED TO A FAMILY OF MEDICEAN SYMPATHIES
AND ON HEARING THIS SENTENCE THE MEANING OF THAT PHRASE USED BY DANTE CAME INTO MY MEMORY WHEN HE AND HIS MASTER VIRGIL ENTERED THE DOORS OF HELL
I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY. WHEN HE SAW THE FIRMNESS OF MY RESOLUTION HE TURNED WITH SOME IRRITATION AND EXCLAIMED
GOD RENDERED ME ABLE TO BRING THEM UP AS I HAVE DONE
I CHOSE TO STRIKE AN AGREEMENT THROWING ON THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY AND PROMISING SEVERAL CROWNS ABOVE THE PRICE THEY BARGAINED FOR
DO NOT LOOK AT THEM OR TALK TO THEM IF YOU CARE TO GO BACK TO FLORENCE. SO WE STAYED AND SAW THE DUKE RETURN
RICCIARDO DEL BENE OUR FLORENTINE BURGHER AND A GREAT MERCHANT IN PARIS
I GAVE THE LAD A KICK AND AS MY GOOD LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT HIM WITH MY FOOT EXACTLY IN THE FORK BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND SENT HIM SPINNING SEVERAL YARDS SO THAT HE CAME STUMBLING UP AGAINST THE KING PRECISELY AT THE MOMENT WHEN HIS MAJESTY ARRIVED
THIS FELLOW IS ONE OF THE FLORENTINES WHO KNOW SOMETHING AND YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO KNOW NOTHING. THEN I RECOGNISED THE MAN AND TURNED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
AND I HEARD LUIGI SAYING
DANNEBAULT WHICH IN OUR TONGUE IS MONSIGNOR DANIBALLE
RAFFAELLO DA MONTELUPO IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY CALLS HIM CATTINARO AND RELATES HOW WHEN HE CAME ONE DAY INTO THE CASTLE TO NEGOTIATE A TREATY HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM BY ONE OF OUR ARQUEBUSIERS. THIS CONFIRMS WHAT FOLLOWS ABOVE
HE EXECUTED LARGE PLATE ONLY
THE BISHOP OF PAVIA THAT IS TO SAY MONSIGNORE DE ROSSI BROTHER OF THE COUNT OF SAN SECONDO ALSO ARRIVED
THEY TOOK ME STRAIGHTWAY TO CASTLE AND LOCKED ME IN AN UPPER CHAMBER IN THE KEEP
I TOO AM WILLING TO REFER MYSELF TO YOU AND SHALL BE SATISFIED WITH YOUR DECISION. THEREUPON GIROLAMO COMPOSED A LETTER WITH MUCH SKILL AND GREATLY TO MY HONOUR FIXING THE SUM WHICH THE DUKE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ME AT 3500 GOLDEN CROWNS IN GOLD
WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE GREAT OBLIGATIONS WHICH THIS ANNIBALE OWED MY FAMILY MY RAGE GREW TO SUCH A PITCH THAT TURNING WHOLLY TO EVIL AND BEING ALSO BY NATURE SOMEWHAT CHOLERIC I WAITED TILL THE MAGISTRATES HAD GONE TO DINNER
THEY REPLIED TO MY BODY WITH EXCUSES DRAWN FROM ALL THAT THEY HAD SUFFERED
MANY OF MY FRIENDS CROWDED IN TO BEHOLD THE MIRACLE OF THE RESUSCITATED DEAD MAN AND AMONG THEM PEOPLE OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE
SECONDLY SO GREAT A DONATION WOULD HAVE EXPOSED YOU TO THE RISK OF LOSING BENVENUTO ALTOGETHER
BORN IN 1491 HE WAS AT THIS EPOCH TUSCAN CONSUL IN ROME
MOREOVER I WILL DEFRAY HIS EXPENSES UNTIL HIS CAPRICE OF MINE HAS LEFT ME. THE CARDINAL CAME HOME AND SENT THE CANDIDATE FOR THIS BISHOPRIC ON THE SPOT TO INFORM ME THAT THE POPE WAS RESOLVED TO HAVE ME BACK BUT THAT HE MEANT TO KEEP ME IN A GROUND-FLOOR ROOM IN HIS PRIVATE GARDEN WHERE I COULD RECEIVE THE VISITS OF MY FRIENDS AS I HAD DONE IN HIS OWN HOUSE
ALLUSION TO THE ANGEL WHO VISITED HIM IN PRISON
XXX THE PLAGUE HAD BY THIS TIME ALMOST DIED OUT SO THAT THE SURVIVORS WHEN THEY MET TOGETHER ALIVE REJOICED WITH MUCH DELIGHT IN ONE ANOTHERS COMPANY
WE SHALL HEAR MUCH MORE OF HIM FROM CELLINI IN THE COURSE OF THIS NARRATIVE
LET FIVE HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS BE GIVEN AT ONCE TO BENVENUTO. THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THEM UP ASKED WHO THE POPES MAN WAS WHO HAD SPOKEN TO THE EMPEROR
THE FORMER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID
BUT SINCE IT IS NOT IN THE NATURE OF FIRE TO DESCEND AND I MUST FORCE IT DOWNWARDS SIX CUBITS BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS I ASSURE YOUR EXCELLENCY UPON THIS MOST CONVINCING GROUND OF PROOF THAT THE FOOT CANNOT POSSIBLY COME OUT

IF YOU WANT THEM COME FOR THEM BEFORE THEY GO WITH ME TO PRISON. NOW CATTIVANZA HAD A WAY OF PUTTING HIS NEIGHBOURS TO THE PUSH NOT CARING TO HAZARD HIS OWN PERSON
BUT YOU WILL NOW LOSE BOTH YOUR HONOUR AND YOUR PROFIT
I ONLY THREW ALL HIS FURNITURE OUT OF DOORS
THAT WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
AND IF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT HE MEANS TO DO IT LET HIM HAVE ALL THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS HE MAY ASK FOR. THE GOVERNOR REPLIED
CVI AT THIS TIME 1 THE DUKE WENT TO MAKE HIS TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO SIENA AND AMMANATO HAD GONE THERE SOME MONTHS EARLIER TO CONSTRUCT THE ARCHES
XLVI I WAS STILL WORKING IN THE SHOP OF RAFFAELLO DEL MORO
WOE IS ME THAT HE HAS FLOWN AWAY WHEN HE PROMISED NOT TO FLY! THE POPE SAID LAUGHING
BUT HE KEEPS IT JEALOUSLY FROM ALL EYES IN ORDER THAT THE DUKE MAY NOT GET WIND OF IT FEARING HE SHOULD IN SOME WAY BE DEPRIVED OF HIS TREASURE. WHILE SPINNING OUT THIS LENGTHY YARN MESSER ALFONSO DID NOT LOOK AT ME BECAUSE WE WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED
HE ADOPTED PROTESTANT OPINIONS AND WAS BEHEADED AND BURNED IN ROME AUGUST 1567
IN ITS OWN PROPER PLACE I SHALL RELATE HOW THOUGH HE HAD THESE STATUES EXCELLENTLY CAST HE OBTAINED A RESULT QUITE CONTRARY TO HIS IMAGINATION
1 HE WAS AN ITALIAN IN THE KINGS SERVICE AND PRACTISED THE SAME ART AS WE DID WITH REMARKABLE ABILITY
I SHOULD NOT HAVE FINISHED MY UNDERTAKINGS IN A HUNDRED YEARS
MY BENVENUTO HERE HAS TOLD ME THAT IF I PURCHASE THIS NECKLACE I SHALL BE THROWING MY MONEY AWAY INASMUCH AS THE PEARLS ARE NEITHER ROUND NOR WELL-MATCHED AND SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE FADED
THAT VERY DAY MEETING HIM IN THE BANCHI HE DEMANDED HIS MONEY RATHER ROUGHLY AS HIS WONT WAS
WHEN THESE WORDS PASSED BETWEEN US WE WERE WALKING ROUND THE KEEP OF THE CASTLE
FOR WHAT YOU SAY IS THE TRUTH AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THE DUCHESS TOSSED HER HEAD DEFIANTLY AND MUTTERED I KNOW NOT WHAT ANGRY SENTENCES
XXIX THE PLAGUE WENT DRAGGING ON FOR MANY MONTHS BUT I HAD AS YET MANAGED TO KEEP IT AT BAY
ON CASTING THIS PIECE IT CAME OUT ADMIRABLY
THIS IS A COPY FROM A LITTLE SILVER GOBLET OF SUCH AND SUCH WEIGHT WHICH I MADE AT SUCH AND SUCH A TIME FOR THAT CHARLATAN MAESTRO JACOPO THE SURGEON FROM CARPI
SEEING THAT ROME IS FLOWING AT THE TIBER FERRARA IS FLOWING AT THE PO LYONS IS FLOWING AT THE SAONE PARIS IS FLOWING AT THE SEINE AND YET THE NAMES OF ALL THESE TOWNS ARE DIFFERENT AND HAVE COME TO THEM BY OTHER WAYS
AFTER SWEEPING UP I MADE MY BED AS DAINTILY AS I COULD LAYING FLOWERS UPON IT WHICH A SAVOYARD USED TO BRING ME NEARLY EVERY MORNING
VI AS I HAVE SAID MY FATHER WAS THE DEVOTED SERVANT AND ATTACHED FRIEND OF THE HOUSE OF MEDICI
CELLINI IN THE NARRATIVE OF HIS SECOND FRENCH JOURNEY EXPLAINS THAT THESE VENTURIERI WERE A NOTABLE CREW OF VERY DARING BRIGANDS IN THE LYONESE PROVINCE
IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE RAISED A BROKEN LANCE ON HIGH
I WILL HOWEVER COME QUICKLY TO THE POINT AT ISSUE
HE TOLD ME TO DO AS I LIKED
THE SIGN OF ITS APPROACH WAS THAT HE KEPT CONTINUALLY TALKING OR RATHER JABBERING TO NO PURPOSE
ACCORDINGLY NEXT DAY IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION WITH THE DUKE HE ALLUDED TO MYSELF DECLARING THAT IF HIS EXCELLENCY HAD NO OBJECTION THE QUEEN WOULD TAKE ME INTO HER EMPLOY
MY LORDS GRANT ME THE FAVOUR OF BEING ALLOWED TO SAY FOUR MORE WORDS IN MY DEFENCE. THE FISCAL WHO WAS A FAR MORE REASONABLE AGENT OF POLICE THAN THE GOVERNOR TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
HE KEPT INDEED ENTICING ME TO PUSH THIS JOB FORWARD BY DAYTIME ALSO
ON THESE ACCOUNTS I FELT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THEY HAD GIVEN ME SUBLIMATE IN THAT VERY DISH
I WAS ILL ABOUT TWO MONTHS DURING WHICH TIME MY FATHER HAD ME MOST KINDLY TREATED AND CURED ALWAYS REPEATING THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I GOT WELL AGAIN IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT HEAR ME PLAY A LITTLE
LIFE GLORY VIRTUE MEASURELESS HATH MADE SUCH GRACE WORTH BEAUTY BE THROUGH ME DISPLAYED THAT FEW CAN RIVAL NONE SURPASS ME QUITE
ON THE SPOT THIS INSTANT YOU SHALL TAKE HIM TO YOUR HOUSE. THEN HAVING GIVEN EXPRESS ORDERS TO THIS PURPOSE HE ROSE FROM TABLE
CXXI I MEANWHILE CONTINUED TO PRAY AS USUAL AND TO WRITE MY CAPITOLO AND EVERY NIGHT I WAS VISITED WITH THE GLADDEST AND MOST PLEASANT DREAMS THAT COULD BE POSSIBLY IMAGINED
CXVII THE CASTELLAN MEANWHILE ILL AND AFFLICTED AS HE WAS HAD HIMSELF TRANSPORTED TO MY PRISON AND EXCLAIMED
SO I BEG YOUR HOLINESS TO TELL ME WHO THE MAN IS
AND WHEN MY OTHER WORKMAN WENT TO HELP HIM HIS HORSE ALSO A BLACK-COLOURED ANIMAL SLIPPED TOWARDS THE LAKE AND HELD ON BY SOME SHRUB WHICH OFFERED BUT A SLIGHT SUPPORT
HAVING FIRM CONFIDENCE IN GOD IT WAS MY DUTY TO AWAIT
I TOOK IT ACCORDINGLY AND HE WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH IT
AND SO IN LIEU OF REWARD HIS PLACE IN THE PALACE WAS TAKEN FROM HIM BY JACOPO SALVIATI UPON THAT MANS ELECTION AS GONFALONIER
WISHING TO BE OF SERVICE TO ME HE TOLD THE POPE THAT I HAD SAVED THE CITY MORE THAN A THOUSAND CROWNS OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY HEAVY RAIN ON THE OCCASION WHEN THE DUCHESS MADE HER ENTRANCE INTO ROME
NOW GOD IS VERY OFTEN MERCIFUL TO MADMEN
1 I ANSWERED WILLINGLY AND IN DETAIL
IN UN CERTO BEL MODO SVOLTO THAT MEANS
AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I WILL HELP MYSELF
TAKE THIS DIAMOND AS A REMEMBRANCE OF HIS EXCELLENCY TO ADORN THE UNIQUE ARTISTS HAND WHICH HAS PRODUCED A MASTERPIECE OF SO SINGULAR MERIT. WHEN DAY BROKE I EXAMINED THE RING AND FOUND THE STONE TO BE A MISERABLE THIN DIAMOND WORTH ABOUT TEN CROWNS
DECREE THAT EVERY ONE WHO LIKES SHALL MAKE A MODEL IN CLAY EXACTLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE MARBLE HAS TO BE
NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST. THEN HE TURNED TO MAESTRO BERNARDINO AND SAID
I NEXT BETOOK MYSELF TO THE CARDINAL OF LORRAINE AND MADE HIM A PRESENT OF THE VASE ONLY PETITIONING HIS EMINENCE TO MAINTAIN ME IN THE KINGS GOOD GRACES
MY LORD THIS IS A STATUE IN GREEK MARBLE AND IT IS A MIRACLE OF BEAUTY
ONE OF THEM IS ALIVE NOW AND A BISHOP
MY LORD IF I TELL YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY THE TRUTH I SHALL MAKE A MORTAL FOE OF THE DUCHESS
HE TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD REPENT AND DEPARTING IN ANGER HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH ALL THE MASTERS OF THE ART
WE PUT OUR CANNON IN ORDER AT THE COMMAND OF SANTACROCE AND WAITED FOR THE SIGNAL
AS I HAVE JUST SAID HE BADE ME TO GET READY ON THE SPOT AND TAKE THE JOURNEY BY THE COMMON POST
I REPLIED THAT THESE WERE NOT THE TIMES NOR WAS I IN THE PLACE TO WEAR SUCH CLOTHES
LORENZO YOU SHALL GIVE HIM THE REVERSE AND HE SHALL DO IT HERE AND SHALL NOT GO AWAY. LORENZO TOOK HIM UP AT ONCE SAYING
THERE IS GOOD REASON ON THE OTHER HAND TO FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THIS RIGHT FOOT SO FAR BELOW AND AT A DISTANCE FROM THE REST. WHEN HE HEARD THESE WORDS THE DUKE TURNED HALF IN ANGER TO SOME GENTLEMEN IN WAITING AND EXCLAIMED

OF THESE PEOPLE WE CAN TRACE THE BISHOP OF VASONA
PERHAPS BERNARDO SABATINI
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH A MAN WHO WOULD DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST A HUNDRED
THE APOLLO IS THE FAMOUS BELVEDERE APOLLO OF THE VATICAN
THE FELLOW WERE ALL OF THEM IN THEIR SHIRTS
HE REPEATED A FEW OF THEM IN THE PRESENCE OF MADAME DETAMPES AND MONSIGNOR DI SAN POLO A GREAT BARON OF FRANCE
WHERE I WROTE WAS IN THE BOOK OF ONE OUR KITH AND KIND
WHAT PRINCE IS THERE WHO WILL PROTECT ME FROM THIS INFAMOUS ASSASSINATION
OUR HOST TOLD ME NOT TO GO ON BOTHERING HIS BRAINS BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED TO DO AS HE HAD SAID
THEREAT THE GOVERNOR ASSUMING HIS POLICE-COURT STYLE OF THREATENING AND BULLYING BEGAN TO SAY
IF HE IS DEAD I AM MORE SORRY THAN YOU ARE
THE CARDINAL HAVING BROKEN FAITH WITH ME AND SUCH SCURVY WORDS HAVING BEEN SPOKEN I SHOULD MAKE MY MIND UP ONCE FOR ALL TO TAKE NO FURTHER TROUBLE WITH THE FERRARESE
SO I COLLECTED FIFTY YOUNG MEN OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE AND WE TOOK UP OUR QUARTERS IN HIS PALACE WITH GOOD PAY AND EXCELLENT APPOINTMENTS
HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN MURDERED IF HE HAD STOPPED
HEAVENS MASTER
THEREFORE WHEN THE DUCHESS SAW ME SHE CALLED FOR ME BY MESSER SFORZA
THE POPE SENT TO TELL HIM TO COME TO ROME
HE RECEIVED ME WITH THE TENDEREST CARESSES AND TOOK IT VERY ILL THAT I HAD NOT DISMOUNTED AT HIS HOUSE
BUT THE SATYRS WHO DOTED ON HIM HAD STEELED HIS PERSON ROUND WITH COASTS OF MAIL AND SUCH-LIKE VILLAINOUS DEFENCES
HERE THE KING WANTED A FIGURE PLACED TO REPRESENT THE GENIUS OF FONTAINEBLEAU
CARPANI STATES THAT BETWEEN MAY AND NOVEMBER 1527 ABOUT 40,000 PERSONS DIED OF PLAGUE IN FLORENCE
AND MARGUERITE DE VALOIS HIS WIFE
IF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY WAS SATISFIED I SHOULD VERY WILLINGLY RETURN TO FRANCE
HE HAD A ROOM PREPARED FOR ME WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO GRAND FOR A CARDINAL AND ALWAYS INSISTED ON MY TAKING MY MEALS BESIDE HIM
1 OWING TO HER FATHERS CARELESSNESS SHE HAD BEEN TREATED BY AN IGNORANT QUACK-DOCTOR WHO PREDICTED THAT THE POOR CHILD WOULD BE CRIPPLED IN THE WHOLE OF HER RIGHT ARM IF EVEN NOTHING WORSE SHOULD HAPPEN
ACCORDINGLY NO SOONER WAS IT SEEN THAN EVERY ONE DECIDED IN MY FAVOUR
IPPOLITO DESTE SON OF ALFONSO DUKE OF FERRARA
CLEAR HE CRIED UPON EARTHS SOD LIVE LONGER THOU
HE WOULD SEE THEM LIBERALLY ATTENDED TO
IN THE NEXT PLACE THE BAS-RELIEFS WOULD HAVE TO STAND TOO LOW BENEATH THE PROPER LINE OF VISION
AFTERWARDS HE SHOWED BY NODS AND GESTURES OF APPROVAL THAT IT PLEASED HIM
EACH DAY THAT FOLLOWED I MADE AN ATTACK WITH STONES PIKES AND ARQUEBUSES FIRING HOWEVER WITHOUT BALL
I RESERVED THE SAME SUM FOR MYSELF TOGETHER WITH THE DIAMOND THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
2 ACCORDINGLY THE MATCH CAME OFF
GOSSIP TRIBOLO YOU NEED NOT TIE YOUR SWORD UP FOR YOU HAVE NEVER LOOSED IT; AND THIS I SAID AT RANDOM BECAUSE I NEVER ONCE HAD SEEN HIM ACT THE MAN UPON THAT JOURNEY
NOW I TOO HAVE A GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE CHILDREN WHICH I BRING FORTH FROM MY ART
YET SINCE REMORSE AVAILS NOT IM CONTENT AS ERST I CAME WELCOME TO GO ONE DAY HERE IN THE FLOWER OF THIS FAIR TUSCAN LAND
THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND THOUGHT HE MUST BE MAD BECAUSE HE WENT ON HOWLING
MATTERS STANDING THUS I TOLD MY FATHER HOW SIGNOR ORAZIO HAD APPOINTED ME CAPTAIN AND THAT I OUGHT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF ENLISTING MY COMPANY
DUKE THIS MARBLE IS ALL CRACKED BUT I SHALL CARVE SOMETHING FROM IT IN SPITE OF THAT
THERE WAS NOTHING HE WOULD NOT GLADLY HAVE DONE TO HARM ME BUT HE MADE NO OPEN DEMONSTRATION OF HIS MIND
AND SINCE I STILL FELT STRONGLY AGITATED I ROSE AT LAST FROM TABLE SAYING THAT I WANTED TO GO AND GET NEW CLOTHES OF BLUE SILK AND STUFF FOR HIM AND ME
THIS BROUGHT THE BISHOP TO PARIS WHENCE HE RETURNED TO ITALY IN 1545
I NEVER HAD A BETTER ASSISTANT THAN HE PROVED
TWO DAYS AFTERWARD I BROUGHT SOME DRAWINGS WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY HAD COMMISSIONED FOR GOLD-WORK HE WANTED TO GIVE HIS WIFE WHO WAS AT THAT TIME STILL IN NAPLES
HE DESIGNED THE HARBOUR OF HAVRE
BESIDES I DID NOT CARE TO BE ORDERED ABOUT SO HAUGHTILY BY A MAN I HAD NEVER SEEN OR SPOKEN TO
THEY SERVED THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF DRAWING OFF THE WAX WHEREBY A SPACE WAS LEFT FOR THE MOLTEN BRONZE TO ENTER AND ALSO OF FACILITATING THE PENETRATION OF THIS MOLTEN METAL BY ALLOWING A FREE ESCAPE OF AIR AND GAS FROM THE OUTER MOULD
A PUPIL OF RAFFAELLO DA URBINO CALLED GIAN FRANCESCO AND COMMONLY KNOWN AS IL FATTORE WAS A PAINTER OF GREAT ABILITY
PROBABLY METACARPAL BONES
THIS MELTED AND ISSUED THROUGH NUMEROUS AIR-VENTS I HAD MADE
THREATS AND RECRIMINATIONS WERE FLUNG ABOUT
HE COULD NOT ENDURE TO SEE SO MUCH MONEY GOING TO THE POPE AND WENT ABOUT THE STREETS CRYING
THE GIRL WAS TEN YEARS OF AGE AND IN HER COMPANY I RETURNED THANKS TO GOD AND S
4 WHEN HE NOTICED THAT I TOO PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THIS PRETTY INSTRUMENT HE PUT IT IN MY HANDS SAYING THAT HE KNEW HOW MUCH PLEASURE I TOOK IN SUCH THINGS AND ADDING THAT I MIGHT CHOOSE FOR EARNEST OF HIS PROMISES AN ARQUEBUSE TO MY OWN LIKING FROM THE ARMOURY EXCEPTING ONLY THIS ONE PIECE
I ANSWERED THAT THE POWER AND GOODNESS OF GOD ARE NOT BOUND TO STAND IN AWE BEFORE THE MALIGN FORCES OF INIQUITY
WHEN MY SERVANTS ASKED FOR THEM I BADE THEM HOLD THEIR TONGUES SAYING I HAD GIVEN THE SHEETS TO SOME OF THOSE POOR SOLDIERS
YET ONE MUST NEEDS LIVE LIKE OTHERS
AND WHEN I WAS ALONE AND OBSERVED THAT NONE OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE WATCHING ME IN THE FIRE OF MY ANGER I LEFT THE PALACE RAN TO MY SHOP SEIZED A DAGGER AND RUSHED TO THE HOUSE OF MY ENEMIES WHO WERE AT HOME AND SHOP TOGETHER
PETERS AND THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT HIM FROM LEAVING ROME
IO NE AREI FATTE VENDETTE A MISURA DI CARBONE XCIII I WENT ON WORKING AT MY BOOK AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I TOOK IT TO THE POPE WHO WAS IN GOOD TRUTH UNABLE TO REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING IT GREATLY
AND THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA TOLD HIS MAJESTY THAT I WAS COME
A SMALL TUSCAN COIN
3 BUT WHAT PARTICULARLY WEIGHED UPON MY MIND WAS THAT I DID NOT CHOOSE TO LEND THE LIGHT OF MY COUNTENANCE IN THAT ILLUSTRIOUS SPHERE TO SOME MISERABLE PLUME-PLUCKED SCARECROW
LIVING AS WE DO IN A CITY OF THIEVES WE OUGHT TO BE UPON OUR GUARD BY DAY AND NIGHT
I WANT TO HELP AND DEFEND HIM
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND AT THE POINT OF PERIL WE HAVE REACHED TRUTH MUST BE SPOKEN
I HAD LOADED A MULE WITH MY BAGGAGE INCLUDING THE CASE WHICH HELD THE CARDINALS JUG AND BASIN
THEN I RECKONED UP THE QUANTITY WHICH WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR MY PURPOSE
AND WHEN ALL THE DAUGHTERS HAD BEEN PORTIONED OFF THE SONS AFTER THEIR FATHERS DEATH DIVIDED WHAT REMAINED
3 THE MAN HAPPENED TO BE VERY POOR AND THE DIAMOND WAS WORTH PERHAPS SOME SCORES OF CROWNS
IN THE PRESENCE OF US ALL THIS GAIO BEGAN TO TALK AND SAID
NOT BEING HOWEVER YET RECOVERED FROM THAT TERRIBLE ILLNESS I GAVE MYSELF FREQUENT RELAXATION BY GOING OUT ON FOWLING EXPEDITIONS WITH MY FRIEND FELICE
SO I WHEELED ROUND AND RETURNED AT A GALLOP TO WHERE I FOUND MY COMRADES TAKING REFUGE IN A FIR-WOOD
IN ADDITION HE WILL PAY YOU FOR ALL THE WORKS YOU DO FOR HIM
HE WILL SERVE YOU ADMIRABLY AND CERTAINLY HE DOES NOT STAND IN NEED OF SKETCHES BY ME
HO
AFTERWARDS HE INQUIRED ABOUT THE WORK I HAD BEEN DOING FOR HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY
YET I SHOULD LIKE TO OBSERVE THE ORDINANCES OF OUR HOLY MOTHER CHURCH
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOUNTAIN I SET A PEDESTAL PROJECTING SOMEWHAT ABOVE THE MARGIN OF THE BASIN AND UPON THIS A NUDE MALE FIGURE OF THE RIGHT PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE DESIGN AND OF A VERY GRACEFUL FORM
WE ENJOYED OUR LIVES TOGETHER IN THAT PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS
YET HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DISAGREEABLE IN PERSONAL INTERCOURSE
AND THIS MAN ALSO WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THE ROW ADVISED FRANCESCO TO BRING ASCANIO BACK TO ME
THEN IT DISSOLVED AND I WAS CARRIED BACK TO MY DARK LAIR
BUT AFTER HE HAD REMAINED AWAY TWO HOURS BY THE CLOCK HE RETURNED WITHOUT ARMED MEN BRINGING ONLY A COUPLE OF LADS TO ASSIST MY MOVEMENTS
FOR FORTUNE ALWAYS COMES UPON US IN NEW WAYS QUITE UNFORESEEN BY OUR IMAGINATION
LXIX I HAPPENED TO HAVE IN MY PURSE A DIAMOND WHICH I SHOWED ABOUT AMONG THE GOLDSMITHS
I HAD NEARLY BROUGHT MY WORK TO ITS COMPLETION WHEN THE EMPEROR ARRIVED AND NUMEROUS TRIUMPHAL ARCHES OF GREAT MAGNIFICENCE WERE ERECTED IN HIS HONOUR
THE FIRST OF THESE WAS IN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN HALF-RELIEF LIFTING ONE HAND TO SUPPORT THE CORNICE AND HOLDING A THICK CLUB IN THE OTHER
IF A POOR COURIER EMPLOYED ON AFFAIRS OF NATIONAL CONSEQUENCE HAS FALLEN SHORT OF MONEY IT IS THE DUTY OF A MAN LIKE YOU TO ASSIST HIM. THEN HE ADDED THAT HE WAS CARRYING THINGS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE FROM MESSER FILIPPO STROZZI
THE FIRST CAST I TOOK IN MY FURNACE SUCCEEDED IN THE SUPERLATIVE DEGREE AND WAS SO CLEAN THAT MY FRIENDS THOUGHT I SHOULD NOT NEED TO RETOUCH IT
THE PLAGUE WAS RAGING WITH INDESCRIBABLE FURY
BUT IF HE IS REALLY BENT ON FINISHING IT HIMSELF LET HIM NAME A CERTAIN TIME
ALLUSION TO HIS PREVISION OF THE CASTELLANS DEATH
AND INTO THESE ARABESQUES ONE MAY EXCELLENTLY WELL INSERT THE FIGURES OF LITTLE BIRDS AND DIFFERENT ANIMALS BY WHICH THE GOOD TASTE OF THE ARTIST IS DISPLAYED
BUT SINCE NO OPPORTUNITY HAS PRESENTED ITSELF AS YET FOR DESCRIBING MY MOST NOTABLE PERFORMANCES I SHALL WAIT TO REPORT THEM IN THEIR PROPER PLACE BEFORE VERY LONG
1 I SPOKE HOWEVER WITH THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA SAYING I HAD BROUGHT SOME MODELS WHICH HIS MAJESTY HAD ORDERED AND BEGGING HIM IF HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IN A WORD WHEREBY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT THEM
I PRAY YOU THEREFORE NOT TO IMPORTUNE HIM ABOUT THIS TRIFLE WHICH WOULD BE NO TRIFLE TO HIM OWING TO HIS WANT OF PRACTICE. I THANKED THE DUKE FOR HIS KIND WORDS BUT BEGGED HIM TO LET ME RENDER THIS TRIFLING SERVICE TO THE DUCHESS
SHE REMARKED THAT I DREW TOO WELL FOR A GOLDSMITH
AND WHEN I HAD CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY WERE NOT CONCEIVED ON A RIGHT METHOD HE SAID
THE THING IS TOO DISGRACEFUL
FURTHERMORE WE FIND THAT THERE ARE CELLINIS OF OUR STOCK IN RAVENNA THAT MOST ANCIENT TOWN OF ITALY WHERE TOO ARE PLENTY OF GENTLE FOLK
THE WHOLE COMPOSITION PRODUCED AN INDESCRIBABLY FINE EFFECT
THAT PRELATE WAS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MAN EXTREMELY RICH BUT DIFFICULT TO PLEASE
I WILL DO SO. THEN PUTTING MY FOOT IN THE STIRRUP IN HIS PRESENCE I SET OFF UPON MY TRAVELS WITHOUT FURTHER LEAVE-TAKING
NOW THE DIAMOND IS NOT A POISON IN ANY TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD BUT ITS INCOMPARABLE HARDNESS ENABLES IT UNLIKE ORDINARY STONES TO RETAIN VERY ACUTE ANGLES
THEY WERE SO NICELY ARRANGED THAT A CHILD COULD PUSH THE STATUE FORWARD AND BACKWARDS OR TURN IT ROUND WITH EASE
MY MOTHER WAS MADONNA ELISABETTA DAUGHTER TO STEFANO GRANACCI
PROBABLY YOU THINK I HAVE NOT THE MONEY TO PAY YOU
HE LEFT MY SISTER STILL YOUNG WITH SIX GIRLS OF ALL AGES ON MY HANDS
SO THAT HE THREW UP THE COMMISSION IN DESPAIR
CONCERNING THE ARMS THEY SAY THAT THESE ARE BOTH STRETCHED OUT WITHOUT ONE TOUCH OF GRACE OR ONE REAL SPARK OF ARTISTIC TALENTS JUST AS IF YOU HAD NEVER SEEN A NAKED MODEL
THEN THE OTHER GUIDE WHO HAD DONE NOTHING CAME UP AND DEMANDED TO BE REWARDED ALSO
310
1 HE HAD A SISTER NAMED FAUSTINA MORE BEAUTIFUL I VERILY BELIEVE THAN THAT FAUSTINA ABOUT WHOM THE OLD BOOKS GOSSIP SO
HE IS TOO GRIEVED FOR YOU AND SHEDS TEARS. THEN I CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME OF MESSER BENEDETTO DA CAGLI 1 AND CRIED
AS IT IS NO PART OF MY PURPOSE TO INCLUDE IN THIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY SUCH THINGS AS ANNALISTS RECORD I HAVE OMITTED THE COMING OF THE EMPEROR WITH HIS GREAT HOST AND THE KINGS MUSTERING OF HIS WHOLE ARMY
ACCORDINGLY BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER OF US WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE UPON OUR LIPS BENT OUR HEADS IN GRIM EARNEST TO THE WORK WHICH BOTH WERE NOW DESIROUS OF ACCOMPLISHING
THEN I BROUGHT THE MODEL SUCCESSFULLY TO A CONCLUSION WITHOUT CARING WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE TO EXECUTE IT IN MARBLE SINCE I KNEW THE DUCHESS WAS RESOLVED I SHOULD NOT GET THE COMMISSION
BENVENUTO RETURN THANKS TO GOD FOR YOU HAVE WON THE BATTLE
IF I LOSE COURAGE AND MY FEEBLE FORCES FAIL THEN IS THE GREAT MIGHT OF GOD MANIFESTED WHICH DESCENDS UNEXPECTEDLY ON THOSE WHO WRONGFULLY INJURE THEIR NEIGHBOURS OR NEGLECT THE GRAVE AND HONOURABLE CHARGE THEY HAVE RECEIVED FROM HIM
THOSE COWARDS YONDER FOUR AGAINST ONE MAN ALONE HAD NOT PLUCK ENOUGH TO CAPTURE A THOUSAND GOLDEN CROWNS IN METAL WHICH HAVE ALMOST BROKEN THIS ARM OF MINE
HE HAD HEARD OUR CONVERSATION AND WHEN THE KING ROSE HE SPOKE IN MY FAVOUR TO THIS PURPORT AS I AFTERWARDS WAS INFORMED
ST AUGUSTINES AIM WAS RELIGIOUS AND DIDACTIC PEPYS NOTED DOWN IN HIS DIARY THE DAILY EVENTS OF HIS LIFE FOR HIS SOLE SATISFACTION AND WITH NO INTENTION THAT ANY ONE SHOULD READ THE CIPHER IN WHICH THEY WERE RECORDED
SEEING MY DESIGNS INTERRUPTED AND MY LIFE IN PERIL I RESOLVED TO FACE THE GUARD
THE REASON OF THIS WAS THAT THE TRAIN OF THE KING DRAGS ITSELF ALONG WITH NEVER LESS THAN 12,000 HORSE BEHIND IT
ATLAS HAD THE HEAVEN UPON HIS BACK MADE OUT OF A CRYSTAL BALL ENGRAVED WITH THE ZODIAC UPON A FIELD OF LAPIS-LAZULI
IF THE PEARLS ARE AS RARE AS YOU CERTIFY I SHOULD NOT HESITATE ABOUT THEIR PURCHASE PARTLY TO GRATIFY THE DUCHESS AND PARTLY TO POSSESS THEM SEEING I HAVE ALWAYS NEED OF SUCH THINGS NOT SO MUCH FOR HER GRACE AS FOR THE VARIOUS USES OF MY SONS AND DAUGHTERS. WHEN I HEARD HIM SPEAK THUS HAVING ONCE BEGUN TO TELL FIBS I STUCK TO THEM WITH EVEN GREATER BOLDNESS
WELL WOULD IT BE FOR ME IF I WENT WITH HIM TO CONSECRATE THE BOOK SINCE THIS WOULD AVERT THE PERIL THAT MENACED ME AND WOULD MAKE US BOTH MOST FORTUNATE
I TOO GREW SOMEWHAT GLORIOUS
AND AT TWENTY-TWO OCLOCK THE MAN WHO BROUGHT IT RETURNED ALL IN A SWEAT FOR HE HAD RUN THE WHOLE WAY MONSIGNOR HAVING AGAIN ASKED FOR IT TO SHOW TO CERTAIN OTHER GENTLEMEN
HE MIGHT GIVE THAT UP TO ME AND ITS VALUE BEING PROBABLY ABOUT TEN CROWNS I WOULD SUPPLY HIM WITH TWENTY-FIVE ON THE SECURITY
WHEN I FELT HOW GREATLY AND HOW WRONGFULLY I HAD BEEN BETRAYED AND SAW A WORK WHICH I HAD GAINED WITH MY GREAT TOIL THUS STOLEN FROM ME I MADE MY MIND UP FOR A SERIOUS STROKE OF BUSINESS AND MARCHED OFF WITH MY GOOD SWORD AT MY SIDE TO FIND BOLOGNA
GOOD BROTHER BENEDETTO DONT FLY INTO A RAGE WITH ME FOR I HAVE DONE YOU NO HARM NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE AFFAIRS OF YOURS
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MESSER BENVEGNATO HAD NOT ANTICIPATED
1 MESSER GIULIO LOST NO TIME IN SPEAKING OF ME TO THE DUKE IN TERMS OF THE WARMEST PRAISE
BUT NOTICING IN WHAT SLIGHT ESTEEM I AM HELD I HAVE HAD NO MIND TO COME BACK AND MAKE AN OFFER OF MYSELF KNOWING THAT I SHALL NEVER LACK FOR BREAD WHITHERSOEVER I MAY GO
UPON THIS I RETORTED WITH INSULTING LANGUAGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I WANT YOU TO GUARD MY PROPERTY FROM BEING STOLEN AND NOT TOUCH IT YOURSELF
ONLY IT GRIEVES ME WHEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT PRECIOUS TIME IN VANITY IVE SPENT THE WIND IT BEARETH MANS FRAIL THOUGHTS AWAY
HE TOOK THE SONNET AND HAVING READ IT MORE THAN ONCE EXCLAIMED
ADDING THAT IF HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP SUFFERED ME TO STAY I SHOULD GAIN ONE FRIEND THE MORE IN MY HOUR OF NEED
PIETRO CARNESECCHI WAS ONE OF THE MARTYRS OF FREE-THOUGHT IN ITALY
SET ME THE JEWEL AFTER THE FASHION YOU HAVE SKETCHED AND KEEP FOR ME THE OLD GOLD IN WHICH IT IS NOW SET. ON THIS THE ROMAN LADY OBSERVED
THE KING IN THE COURSE OF A LONG CONVERSATION COMPLAINED THAT THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA TO WHOSE CARE HE HAD ENTRUSTED ME NEVER GAVE A THOUGHT TO MY AFFAIRS
FEEL HERE
THE DUCHESS WOULD NOT TAKE THE CRUCIFIX AS A GIFT
AND ONCE MORE SEEK THE CELL WHEREIN I RACK FOR RAGE BOTH HEART AND MIND
BARBAROUS WRETCH
HOWEVER THAT DID NOT DISMAY ME
AMONG OTHERS I HAD TO MAKE HIS PONTIFICAL SEAL OF THE SIZE OF THE HAND OF A BOY OF TWELVE
25
I MEANWHILE HAVING BROUGHT THIS PART OF THE COLOSSUS ALMOST TO COMPLETION LEFT IT ALONE AND INDULGED MY VANITY A BIT BY EXPOSING IT TO SIGHT
NOT A YEAR PASSED BUT HE GOT SOME SUCH HYPOCHONDRIAC NOTIONS INTO HIS HEAD
THEN I PUT MY THUMB-NAIL TO THE ANGELS OF ITS FACETS TOOK IT FROM THE RING CLEANED IT UP A LITTLE AND HANDED IT TO THE VICEROY
PERHAPS YOU NEVER HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT BEFORE
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE MAGNIFICENT PIERO SODERINI WAS ELECTED AND MY FATHER CONTINUED IN HIS OFFICE OF MUSICIAN SODERINI PERCEIVING HIS WONDERFUL TALENT BEGAN TO EMPLOY HIM IN MANY MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS AN ENGINEER
I HAD JUST COME TO THE AUGUSTINES--NOW THIS WAS A VERY PERILOUS PASSAGE AND THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED PACES DISTANT FROM MY DWELLING YET THE LODGING IN THE CASTLE BEING QUITE AS FAR REMOVED INSIDE NO ONE COULD HAVE HEARD MY VOICE IF I HAD SHOUTED--WHEN I SAW FOUR MEN WITH FOUR SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS ADVANCING TO ATTACK ME
SER BENEDETTO DID THE BEST HE COULD TO EXCUSE HIMSELF SWORE THAT HE HAD PAID THE GOLDSMITH AND SAID HE HAD NO POWER TO CURB THE RAGE OF MADMEN
I HAVE MENTIONED ONE. I SAID
SUCH WAS THE VIRTUE OF THE WORMWOOD THAT I IMMEDIATELY REGAINED MY SCATTERED FACULTIES
THIS IS A MOST COURAGEOUS YOUNG MAN
NONE SUCH HOWEVER WERE TAKEN WITH ME WHO HAD THE LICENSE TO GO WHERE I LIKED EVEN AT THOSE TIMES ABOUT IT PRECINCTS
MEANWHILE A CERTAIN BACCIO BETTINI 2 WHO HAD AN UGLY BIG HEAD LIKE A BUSHEL CAME UP AND BEGAN TO BANTER ME IN THE SAME WAY ABOUT DUKES CALLING OUT
AND I THRUSTING MY NECK FORWARD WHERE THE CASK HAD FALLEN HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAYING
WHEN WE HAD GONE TEN MILES ON THE PO WE SIGHTED THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD GOT INTO A SKIFF AND CAUGHT US UP
I HAD FIVE EXCELLENT JOURNEYMEN AND IN ADDITION TO THE GREAT PIECE I WAS ENGAGED ON SEVERAL JOBS
I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD COME THEREIN THAT WAY SOLELY IN ORDER TO CLEAR MY CHARACTER
NO SOONER HAD I BEEN LOCKED IN THAN I WENT ABOUT EXPLORING MY PRISON
NO SOONER HAD I SET EYES ON THEM THAN I EXCLAIMED
FOR THE BONE COMING INTO VIOLENT CONTACT WITH THE BALL AND NOT BEING ABLE TO BEND HAD SNAPPED AT THAT POINT
WHEREUPON THE POPE BADE THE MAN WRITE AND TELL ME TO RETURN TO HIM
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR HOUSE FREE OF CHARGES. AFTER THIS HE SIGNED A RESCRIPT UNDERNEATH THE PETITION I HAD DRAWN UP AND WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS PRESERVED AMONG MY PAPERS
WHEN THEY CAME TO JUPITER AND HAD DUG BUT SCARCELY TWO CUBITS THEY SENT UP SUCH A YELL THEY AND THEIR FOUR WORKMEN THAT IT WOKE ME UP
XLI ON THE ENTREATY OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER I REMAINED AT FLORENCE THOUGH MY OWN INCLINATION LED ME TO RETURN TO ROME
FEELING THEN THAT WE HAD COME WELL OUT OF A GREAT PERIL WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OUR PRAYERS TO GOD AND MISERERES HAD HELPED US MORE THAN WE COULD HAVE HELPED OURSELVES
BUT I WAS FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO TOUCH A FARTHING IN ORDER TO SECURE MY CREDIT AND CONVINCE THE DUKE I WAS NOT PROMPTED BY AVARICE
EVERYBODY IN MY HOUSE WAS BUSILY EMPLOYED SO THAT THE UNEXPECTED ENTRANCE OF HIS MAJESTY TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
WHEREFORE I KNEW THAT I COULD NOT ESCAPE UPON THAT SIDE
LITTLE BY LITTLE IT INCREASED IN SIZE UNTIL THE STONES MIGHT BE COMPARED TO BALLS FROM A CROSSBOW
MOREOVER HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED JUSTLY AND I AGAINST ALL EQUITY
WHO SHALL FORBID THE SAD EXPENSE OF TEARS
POPE CLEMENT BY THIS HAD SENT TO DEMAND ASSISTANCE FROM THE DUKE OF URBINO WHO WAS WITH THE TROOPS OF VENICE
SHE ASKED WHITHER HE WAS BOUND ADDING THAT SHE WOULD ACCOMPANY HIM
KNOWEST THOU WHO LENT THEE THAT BODY WHICH THOU WOULDST HAVE SPOILED BEFORE ITS TIME? I SEEMED TO ANSWER THAT I RECOGNIZED ALL THINGS PERTAINING TO ME AS GIFTS FROM THE GOD OF NATURE
THE HOUSE IN VIA CHIARA WITH SOME OTHER TRIFLES FELL TO THE SHARE OF ONE OF THE SAID SONS WHO HAD THE NAME OF ANDREA
MY YOUNG MEN WERE ADVISING ME TO FLY
WHEN HE KNEW THAT I WAS FIRMLY RESOLVED TO GO MUTTERING BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND LIMPING AS WELL AS HE COULD HE CAME ON BEHIND ME VERY SLOWLY AND AT A GREAT DISTANCE
THIS REVIVED HOPE IN ME
HE WORKED THEM HOWEVER RATHER AT A LOSS THAN PROFIT
AND AS FOLK SAID HE GOT BUT LITTLE OF THE MONEY SINCE HIS LORDSHIP LAID HIS HANDS ON IT AND HAD THE MIND TO USE IT
BANDINELLI WAS A KNIGHT OF S
MONTELUPO WAS ALSO A GUNNER AND COMMANDED TWO PIECES
COME AND SPEAK A WORD IN DEFENCE OF THE STATUE. IN REPLY TO THIS APPEAL SO KINDLY MADE ME BY THE DUKE I SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
TO ANOTHER GENTLEMAN MONSIGNOR DI MARMAGNA THE TREASURER OF LANGUEDOC HE LEFT THE DUTY OF MOLESTING ME
AND SO STUDYING THE WORST THAT I COULD DO AGAINST HIM I SELECTED A GERFALCON WHICH I HAD AT HAND
HE STRUCK LEO XS COINS
NOT A WHOLE MONTH HAD BEEN COMPLETED AFTER THIS SCENE BEFORE THE MAN PIERINO HAPPENED TO BE BUILDING A VAULT IN A HOUSE OF HIS WHICH HE HAD IN THE VIA DELLO STUDIO
AND THIS DAY WAS A FESTIVAL
1 I PARTED COMPANY WITH SIGNOR IPPOLITO GONZAGA WHO TOOK THE ROUTE FOR MIRANDOLA WHILE I DIVERGED UPON THE ROAD TO PARMA AND PIACENZA
I CHOSE HER HOUSE FOR REFUGE BECAUSE I WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD COME WITH THAT GREAT PRINCESS FROM FLORENCE WERE TARRYING THERE
VIII
1 I WOULD TREASURE THAT SO LONG AS I LIVED IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS EXCELLENCY TOGETHER WITH THE HONOURABLE MESSAGE HE HAD SENT ME
THEREFORE I CRAVE YOUR PARDON
CROCE
SEE BOCCACCIO DECAM GIOR
YET I RAN A NARROW RISK OF COMING TO GRIEF AT MONTE RUOSI
HE THEN SAID BEWARE, AND ADDED
I REPLIED THAT I WOULD LIGHT A CANDLE AT THAT CROSS WHICH SHOULD I HOPED MAKE HIM TO BE THE FIRST TO WEEP HIS FOLLY
IT IS ENOUGH FOR US TO HAVE FOUND THE PROPERTY WHICH WE HAD LOST
ONE DAY SHE GAVE HER MOTHER THE SLIP AND CAME TO SEE ASCANIO AT NIGHT
HOWEVER HE DIED
BUT THE DUKE APPARENTLY WISHES TO MAINTAIN HIS GEM IN CREDIT
VASARI IN HIS LIFE OF BANDINELLO GIVES A CURIOUS CONFIRMATION OF CELLINIS VERACITY BY REPORTING THIS QUARREL WITH SOME OF THE SPEECHES WHICH PDSSED BETWEEN THE TWO RIVAL ARTISTS
ANTONIO UBERTINI CALLED IL BACHIACCA A BROTHER OF CELLINIS FRIEND IN ROME
WHEN I REACHED THE HOUSE OF THE TREASURER I FOUND THAT HE HAD THE MONEY LAID OUT BEFORE HIM AND WAS SELECTING THE BEST PIECES AS THE KING HAD ORDERED
THINK HOW THY LIFE DID FLIT
I AFFIRM MOST EMPHATICALLY THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY COULD NOT PAY ME WITH MORE GLORIOUS COIN NOR ADD FROM ANY TREASURY A WEALTH SURPASSING THIS
IN HIS COMPANY CAME A CERTAIN MATIO FRANZESI 2 AND THIS MAN ALSO APPEARED TO BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR MY DEATH NOT INDEED BECAUSE HE WOULD INHERIT ANYTHING FROM ME BUT BECAUSE HE WISHED FOR WHAT HIS MASTER SEEMED TO HAVE SO MUCH AT HEART
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I HAD GIVEN MYSELF UP FOR DEAD WHEN I SAW THE TERROR OF THE NECROMANCER
HIS RIGHT NAME HOWEVER WAS FRANCESCO PRIMATICCIO
NOW MY WORKPEOPLE AND SERVING-MEN WERE OBLIGED TO CLOSE MY SHOP AT THE ORDER OF THE CARDINALS SANTI QUATTRO 1 AND CORNARO WHO TOLD ME OPENLY THAT THE POPE WOULD NOT HEAR OF SETTING ME AT LARGE AND THAT THE GREAT FAVOURS SHOWN ME BY KING FRANCIS HAD DONE FAR MORE HARM THAT GOOD
THE VERSES RAN AS FOLLOWS HERE LIETH BERNARDONE ASS AND PIG SPY BROKER THIEF IN WHOM PANDORA PLANTED ALL HER WORST EVILS AND FROM THENCE TRANSPLANTED INTO THAT BRUTE BUACCIOS CARCASS BIG. 2 BOTH THE INCIDENT AND THE VERSES WENT THE ROUND OF THE PALACE GIVING THE DUKE AND DUCHESS MUCH AMUSEMENT
THE LIEUTENANT THEN SUBMITTED THAT SOME SMALL FORCE WOULD HAVE TO BE EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE
I AM A POOR GOLDSMITH WHO SERVE WHOEVER PAYS ME
XVI BEING VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE HAD SEEN THE KING RETURNED TO HIS PALACE AFTER BESTOWING ON ME TOO MANY MARKS OF FAVOUR TO BE HERE RECORDED
LXXXVI WHEN EIGHT DAYS HAD COME AND GONE MY AMENDMENT WAS SO SLIGHT THAT LIFE ITSELF BECAME ALMOST A BURDEN TO ME
5 EVERY EVENING I USED TO HOLD LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CARDINAL IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HIS LORDSHIP ADVISED ME TO REMAIN AT AN ABBEY OF HIS IN LYONS AND THERE TO ABIDE AT EASE UNTIL THE KING RETURNED FROM THIS CAMPAIGN ADDING THAT HE WAS GOING ON TO GRENOBLE AND THAT I SHOULD ENJOY EVERY CONVENIENCE IN THE ABBEY
THE CASE IS THIS
THE CLEVER SURGEON PAID ME VERY WELL AND YET THE HONOUR WHICH THE VASES BROUGHT ME WAS WORTH A HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH
WHEN I HEARD THIS ARGUMENT I LAUGHED ALOUD AND THEN TOLD RUBERTA TO GO AND SEE HOW CATERINA WAS SINCE I SHOULD LIKE TO EMPLOY HER AGAIN WHILE FINISHING THE WORK I HAD ON HAND
AT LIONE I RESTED FOUR DAYS AND HAD MUCH PLEASANT INTERCOURSE WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS THERE
INDEED HE COULD NOT BUY OBEY THE CALL
AND I BEING EAGER TO SEE THE WORLD WENT WITH GOOD GRACE
THE CARDINAL CAME AT LEAST TWICE A DAY TO SEE ME BRINGING WITH HIM MESSER LUIGI ALAMANNI AND MESSER GABRIEL CESANO
AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT I AM POSSESSED OF FREE-WILL AND IF I COULD EXERT THE FAITH OF A SAINT I AM SURE THAT THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN WOULD BEAR ME FROM THIS DUNGEON AND RELIEVE ME OF ALL MY AFFLICTIONS YET INASMUCH AS GOD HAS NOT DEEMED ME WORTHY OF SUCH MIRACLES I CONCLUDE THAT THOSE CELESTIAL INFLUENCES MUST BE WREAKING THEIR MALIGNITY UPON ME
AND A SWORD BECOMES HIM BETTER THAN A FRIARS FROCK
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE PAINTER WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE WHOLE MATTER CAME IN AND THE BISHOP BADE HIM GO AND TELL ME THAT IF I DID NOT BRING THE VASE AT ONCE HE WOULD MAKE MINCEMEAT OF ME
HE WAS A GREAT CONNOISSEUR IN THE ARTS OF DESIGN
AND WHEN I WISHED TO ASSIGN HIS APARTMENTS TO SOME OF MY GERMAN WORKMEN THE FELLOW REFUSED TO LEAVE THE PLACE
FOR THEY RETIRED STEP BY STEP SAYING AMONG THEMSELVES IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE
I ONLY GATHERED FROM IT THAT HE PROFESSED HIMSELF A GOOD CHRISTIAN WISHED TO BEAR NO MAN MALICE AND ASKED ME IN THE DUKES NAME WHAT SALARY I SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT
THE KING ACCEPTED HIS PROPOSAL AND GAVE HIM THE INTRODUCTIONS HE REQUIRED
IF YOU EMPLOY HIM ON SO GREAT AN UNDERTAKING YOU WILL OF NECESSITY DEPRIVE YOURSELF OF THOSE OTHER THINGS ON WHICH YOUR HEART IS SET
AVEVA DATO A GUARDIA LA LATTUGA AI PAPERI XXXIV IF I DID NOT CONFESS THAT IN SOME OF THESE EPISODES I ACTED WRONGLY THE WORLD MIGHT THINK I WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THOSE IN WHICH I SAY I ACTED RIGHTLY
1 OPEN IT AND LET US SEE WHAT IT CONTAINS. WHEN I HAD OPENED THE BOX I CRIED TO THE DUKE
FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD I WILL BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SAY. THEN LOADING ME WITH MARKS OF FAVOUR HE ADDED
THE BUILDING WAS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
I BEGGED HIS HOLINESS TO BESTOW THIS LITTLE THING ON ME MEANWHILE BY WAY OF EARNEST
BUT I LAUGHED AT HIM AND TOOK MY LEAVE IN THE COMPANY OF A PAINTER WHOM I FOUND THERE
FOR WHEN AT LAST I HEARD THEM CAPTAIN SANDRINO MONALDI 1 HAD ENTERED AND I HEARD HIM SAYING
SO INTENSE WAS THE ANXIETY THAT I SEEMED TO LOSE MY EYESIGHT AND TOLD THEM THEY THEMSELVES MUST UNLOCK THE CHEST AND SEE HOW MANY OF THE POPES GEMS WERE MISSING
I REPLIED THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE
HE HAD IT ALSO IN HIS MIND TO MAKE ME PAY THE COSTS WHICH THE LATE CASTELLAN POOR MAN REMITTED IN MY FAVOUR
IN THE END YOU WILL DISCOVER WHICH OF US HERE IS THE GREATEST VILLAIN. THE COUNTRY-FELLOW WHEN HE SPOKE THOSE WORDS SMILED WITH AN EVIL KIND OF SNEER AND JERKED HIS HEAD AS THOUGH TO SAY
LISTEN FOR A MOMENT AND AFTERWARDS JUDGE WHICH OF US KNOWS BEST WHAT HE IS SAYING. THEN TURNING TO MESSER ALBERTO WHO WAS A MAN OF GREAT GRAVITY AND TALENT I BEGAN
WHERETO THE POPE REJOINED
BENVENUTO THE PAINTER BOLOGNA HAS OBTAINED COMMISSION FROM THE KING TO EXECUTE YOUR GREAT COLOSSUS AND ALL THE ORDERS PREVIOUSLY GIVEN AS ON YOUR BEHALF HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO HIM
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PASSAGE WHICH HAS NOT I THINK BEEN PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY CELLINIS TRANSLATORS
ONE OF THE SERVANTS ALSO WHO HAD DRAWN HIS SWORD FELL DOWN TOGETHER WITH HIS MASTER AND WOUNDED HIM BADLY IN THE HAND
FROM THAT PLACE ONWARD I HAD NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER ESPECIALLY AS I MADE A POINT OF TRAVELLING A FEW MILES IN FRONT AND THE BEST MEN OF THE RETINUE KEPT A GOOD WATCH OVER ME
DO NOT EXPECT MOST REVEREND MONSIGNOR IF YOU ORDER IT TO GET IT IN YOUR LIFETIME
COME HERE WITH YOUR WORK
BEFORE I TAKE YOU OUT OF ITALY I WANT YOU TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU COME TO FRANCE
THEN I TOOK MY WAY ALONG A VERY FAIR ROAD THROUGH A FOREST HOPING TO MAKE AT LEAST FORTY MILES THAT DAY AND REACH THE MOST OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE I COULD
IT IS CERTAIN THAT IF I HAD BEEN CUNNING ENOUGH TO SECURE BY CONTRACT ALL I WANTED FOR MY WORK I SHOULD NOT HAVE INCURRED THE GREAT TROUBLES WHICH CAME UPON ME THROUGH MY OWN FAULT
THE FIRST THING HE SAW ON COMING INTO THE GREAT HALL WAS MYSELF WITH A HUGE PLATE OF SILVER IN MY HAND WHICH I WAS BEATING FOR THE BODY OF MY JUPITER
I FIRST LAID DOWN AN OVAL FRAMEWORK CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN HALF A CUBIT--ALMOST TWO-THIRDS IN FACT
COME WITH ME AND THOU SHALT SOON BEHOLD. IN MY HAND I HAD A PONIARD AND UPON MY BACK A COAT OF MAIL
HAVING UP TO THIS DATE DONE NOTHING OF THE SORT I CONFERRED WITH CERTAIN OLD MEN EXPERIENCED IN THAT ART AT PARIS AND DESCRIBED TO THEM THE METHODS IN USE WITH US IN ITALY
ALL THIS WAS REPORTED TO ME
TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY I MAINTAINED THE CONVERSATION AND TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT BINDO ALTOVITIS BUST
THIS PERSONAGE CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED
COSIMO WAS ELECTED DUKE UPON THE 9TH OF JANUARY 1537
IT CUT LIKE A RAZOR
BE OF GOOD CHEER MY BENVENUTO FOR I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE UNTIL I SEE YOU RESTORED TO HEALTH. I TOLD HIM NOT TO COME TOO CLOSE SINCE IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME
XLVII MY BROTHER AT THIS PERIOD WAS ALSO IN ROME SERVING DUKE ALESSANDRO ON WHOM THE POPE HAD RECENTLY CONFERRED THE DUCHY OF PENNA
AND SO I REMAINED HERE MUCH TO MY REGRET
THE DUKE SMACKED THEM WITH SEVERAL HEARTY BOXES AND IN ORDER TO GET RID OF HIM STRUCK RATHER HARDER THAN HIS WONT WAS
AND THUS IT WAS BY PURE SKILL IN THE ART THAT I FILLED SUCH HEAVY BAGS
HE TOOK THEM AND RECOGNISING AT ONCE THEIR MASTERY OF ART LOOKED MESSER PIETRO IN THE FACE AND SAID
NOW SEE YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
AFTER HAVING WELL CONSIDERED IT FOR SOME TIME ALWAYS WITH GREATER SATISFACTION HE BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
THEY CONTINUED THROUGHOUT CELLINIS LIFE TO LIVE ON TERMS OF INTIMACY WITH HIM
3 AT MONTE RUOSI WE JOINED THE COMPANY WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS POPE JULIUS II
THAT HONEST FELLOW WAS EXCELLENT IN ALL HIS DEALINGS WITH SOLDIERS ESPECIALLY WITH THE MILITIA WHO ARE FOR THE MOST PART RUSTICS
THIS TASSO WAS A MOST EXCELLENT CRAFTSMAN THE BEST I BELIEVE WHO EVER LIVED IN HIS OWN BRANCH OF ART
UPON THIS THE DUCHESS WITH SOME ANGER OBSERVED THAT SHE VERY WELL KNEW WHAT I MEANT AND BADE ME NEVER MENTION THAT BLOCK OF MARBLE IN HER PRESENCE SINCE SHE DID NOT LIKE IT
WHEN HE HEARD THESE CHOLERIC WORDS HE TURNED UPON ME IN STERN ANGER AND EXCLAIMED
HE MADE ME PRESENTS OF KIDS CHEESE CAPONS FRESH CURDS AND MANY SORTS OF FRUITS UNTIL I BEGAN TO BE ALMOST ASHAMED OF SO MUCH KINDNESS
THE RESULT WAS THAT IN MY IRRITATION I MORE THAN ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO MAKE OFF WITHOUT ASKING LEAVE
BEFORE I TOOK HORSE ONE THOUSAND CROWNS WERE PAID ME PARTLY FOR MY SALARY AND PARTLY ON ACCOUNT OF MONIES I HAD DISBURSED
I HAVE SHOWN YOU THAT I CANNOT DO WHAT I DO NOT WANT AND WHAT I HAD THE POWER TO DO I HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO DO. THEN I CALLED FOR TRIBOLO THE BOATMAN AND LAMENTONE TO EMBARK
2 WHEN THE POPE SET EYES ON ME HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY GLAD
XVIII I WENT OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF SANTA MARIA NOVELLA AND STUMBLING UP AGAINST FRA ALESSIO STROZZI WHOM BY THE WAY I DID NOT KNOW I ENTREATED THIS GOOD FRIAR FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TO SAVE MY LIFE SINCE I HAD COMMITTED A GREAT FAULT
HE WENT WHILE A VERY YOUNG MAN TO ROME AND THEN SETTLED AT FLORENCE
LET THE DUKE IF HE WANTS TO EMPLOY MY TALENTS GIVE ME THE MIDDLE DOOR OF THE CATHEDRAL TO PERFORM IN BRONZE
BUT SINCE I DO NOT CARE TO BE TOO PROLIX OR TO EXHIBIT MYSELF OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF MY PROFESSION I WILL OMIT THE LARGER PART OF THEM ONLY TOUCHING UPON THOSE I CANNOT WELL NEGLECT WHICH SHALL BE THE FEWEST IN NUMBER AND THE MOST REMARKABLE
LET US GO HOME AS SOON AS WE CAN FOR THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE HERE
WITHOUT FURTHER PROVOCATION HE RETORTED THAT I WAS A DONKEY
FAIR BOY TELL YOUR MASTER THAT HE IS A GREAT AND ABLE ARTIST AND THAT I BEG HIM TO BE WILLING TO HAVE ME FOR A FRIEND AND NOT TO ENGAGE IN AUGHT ELSE. THE MISSION OF THAT VIRTUOUS AND MARVELLOUS LAD CAUSED ME THE GREATEST JOY
O MOST REVEREND MONSIGNOR I HAVE NOT GOT MY ONION-STEW READY NOR SHALL I MAKE IT READY UNLESS YOU GIVE ME ONIONS TO CONCOCT IT WITH. AT THESE WORDS THE CARDINAL WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A DONKEY THAN A MAN TURNED UGLIER BY HALF THAN HE WAS NATURALLY
I SAID THEN TO PAGOLO
WHEREAS A BOX ON THE EAR IN THE NEW MARKET CARRIES A FINE OF TWENTY-FIVE CROWNS WHILE A BLOW COSTS LITTLE OR NOTHING
LORENZO DE MEDICI AND PIETRO HIS SON WHO HAD A GREAT LIKING FOR HIM PERCEIVED LATER ON THAT HE WAS DEVOTING HIMSELF WHOLLY TO THE FIFE AND WAS NEGLECTING HIS FINE ENGINEERING TALENT AND HIS BEAUTIFUL ART
DURING THIS HURLY-BURLY SOME OF THE SOLDIERS AND CAPTAINS WOUNDED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN ARMS
BUT IF SOME ONE CAME TO KILL YOU PRIEST AS YOU ARE YOU WOULD DEFEND YOURSELF AND IF YOU KILLED HIM THE SANCTITY OF LAW WOULD HOLD YOU JUSTIFIED
LOOK YOU HOW NATURE HAS TAKEN PRECISELY WHAT SHE WANTED NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
I MADE THEM A RESPECTFUL BOW AND RETURNED TO FLORENCE BURNING WITH EAGERNESS TO SET HANDS UPON MY MODEL
LXXVI NO SOONER HAD I GOT TO BED THAN I ORDERED MY SERVING-MAIDS TO CARRY FOOD AND WINE FOR ALL THE MEN INTO THE WORKSHOP
YOU ARE A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING RASCAL
I HAD THE FIRST DOCTORS OF ROME CALLED IN AMONG WHOM WAS FRANCESCO DA NORCIA A PHYSICIAN OF GREAT AGE AND OF THE BEST REPUTE IN ROME
HIS WORK REMAINED UNFINISHED
THE PONT DU CHANGE REPLACED BY THE PONT NEUF
ONE TIME HE THOUGHT HE WAS AN OILJAR
NO ONE BUT YOU COULD HAVE PERFORMED THEM. SO HE MADE ME REACH MY HAND FORTH AND SAID
THIS MAN AND THAT SHE MENACED WHILE SHE CRIED
ONE CAN SEE CLEARLY THAT HE HAS A PASSION FOR LABOUR
THEN I FELL TO EATING WITH THE SAME STOUT HEART FOR MY SALVATION AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY PREPARED FOR MY PERDITION
THE MEN OBEYED AND BROUGHT ME TO THE CASTLE WHENCE I HAD ESCAPED
I DID NOT HOWEVER NEGLECT TO GRATIFY MY GOOD FATHER FROM TIME TO TIME BY PLAYING ON THE FLUTE OR CORNET
XXIII MY ILL-LUCK WILLED THAT I WAS NOT WIDE-AWAKE ENOUGH TO PLAY THE LIKE COMEDY WITH MADAME DETAMPES
THIS GAVE HER AS MUCH ANNOYANCE AS IT GAVE ME PLEASURE
I WENT TO SEE HIM
MOST BLESSED FATHER YOUR HOLINESS IS SENDING THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT INTO FRANCE
AND SINCE THE SOLDIERS CALLED HIM CECCHINO DEL PIFFERO 1 HIS REAL NAME BEING GIOVANFRANCESCO CELLINI I WANTED TO ENGRAVE THE FORMER BY WHICH HE WAS COMMONLY KNOWN UNDER THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF OUR FAMILY
THE WEATHER WAS VERY COLD
HOW SHE DID SO IS MIXED UP WITH THE HISTORY OF A YOUNG MAN CALLED LUIGI PULCI WHO HAD RECENTLY COME TO ROME
HE WAS TALL STOUT AND FAT AND OF AN EXTREMELY SEVERE COUNTENANCE
1 THUS THEN WE FIND
I WENT OFF AT ONCE BECAUSE HIS LORDSHIP HAD SPOKEN OF WANTING TO ORDER SEVERAL BIG SILVER VASES
I HAD MOREOVER GOT MY STOMACH OUT OF ORDER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT FOR THE SPACE OF FOUR MONTHS AS I VERILY BELIEVE I HARDLY ATE ONE WHOLE LOAF OF BREAD IN THE WEEK
MESSER GIOVANNI SHOWED SIGNS TOO EVIDENT OF LOVING HIM IN A DISHONOURABLE WAY
ON THE ROAD WE MET WITH SOME ANNOYANCES BUT NOT OF ANY GREAT MOMENT
THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS AND IS DATED JULY 15 1544
BEING THEN REFRESHED IN STRENGTH AND SPIRITS I ATTACKED THE GREAT STATUE OF MARS WHICH I HAD SET UP SOLIDLY UPON A FRAME OF WELL-CONNECTED WOODWORK
BUT YOU MUST ALSO KNOW THAT HE INSULTED THE DUKE AND NOT ME
7 I FOUND HIM WITH ONE BERNARDONACCIO 8 A GOLDSMITH WHO DID NOT TREAT HIM WELL
KNOWING THEREFORE THAT I COULD NOT ENJOY THE DELICACIES OF YOUR ROYAL TABLE I WILL STAY AND TALK WITH YOU WHILE YOUR EXCELLENCY IS SUPPING
CARDINAL DE MEDICI WAS VERY ANGRY
BENVENUTO I AM YOUR FRIEND! TO THIS I ANSWERED
HOWEVER I ASKED ADVICE OF MESSER GADDI AND HE REFERRED TO A WRETCHED DOCTOR-FELLOW HE EMPLOYED 1 WHO ASKED ME IF I HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED
IT WAS THE LARGEST THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN
I COULD NOT MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FIRST POSTMASTER BUT PERSISTED IN MY PURPOSE TO PRESS FORWARD AND ENDURE AN ANXIOUS LIFE AT FLORENCE
ONE WAS THAT I CUT MY GROOVES MUCH DEEPER AND WITH WIDER TRENCHES IN THE STEEL
THIS I DID THEN
HE WOULD CONTINUE MY ALLOWANCE OF TWO HUNDRED CROWNS A YEAR WHILE THEY WERE TO SUPPLY THE REST OUT OF THEIR FUNDS
HE AMASSED A LARGE FORTUNE WHICH WHEN HE DIED AT FERRARA ABOUT 1530 HE BEQUEATHED TO THE DUKE THERE
WHEN THE KING SAW SO MANY FINISHED THINGS BEFORE HIM HE EXCLAIMED TO MADAME DETAMPES
THAT THE TIARA SEEMS TO WEEP FOR RAGE UPON YOUR HEAD
WE FIND HIM GODFATHER TO ONE OF CELLINIS CHILDREN
CELLINI CONFUSES JESI WITH FORLIMPOPOLI
MESSER LUIGI RUCELLAI ALSO SENT WITH MARVELLOUS PROMPTITUDE AND COURTESY TO PUT HIS SERVICES AT MY DISPOSAL AS DID MANY OTHER GREAT FOLK OF HIS STATION
AND HE SAYS THAT YOUR HOLINESS IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE
NOW VILLEROIS WAS A MAN OF THE HIGHEST TALENT EXCEPTIONALLY DISTINGUISHED IN ALL POINTS AND POSSESSED OF VAST WEALTH
THERE WAS ONE GIOVAN BATTISTA SURNAMED IL TASSO A WOOD-CARVER PRECISELY OF MY OWN AGE WHO ONE DAY SAID TO ME THAT IF I WAS WILLING TO GO TO ROME HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO JOIN ME
AND SO THE LEASE WAS DRAWN FOR FIVE YEARS
THE LABOUR WAS MORE THAN I COULD STAND
HAVING NO MORE AT MY DISPOSAL I COULD NOT EXECUTE OTHERS
SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
BUT I REPEAT THAT YOUR WORK SEEMS TO ME AS THOUGH IT WOULD NEVER BE FINISHED. WHETHER THE DUKE HEARD SOMETHING OF THIS ENCOUNTER OR WHATEVER THE CAUSE WAS HE BEGAN AGAIN AS USUAL
THAT EVIL FELLOW MY MORTAL FOE MESSER PIER FRANCESCO RICCI MAJORDOMO OF THE DUKE TOOK GREAT PAINS TO FIND OUT HOW THE AFFAIR HAD GONE
THIS TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF ART WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO MICHEL AGNOLO MADE THE DIVINE MASTER GIVE SUCH PRAISES TO MY WORK THAT I FELT INCREDIBLY INSPIRED FOR FURTHER EFFORT
HE TOLD THE KING THAT WHEN HIS MAJESTY HAD ONCE SET EYES UPON THOSE MARVELLOUS WORKS HE WOULD THEN AND NOT TILL THEN BE ABLE TO CRITICISE THE ARTS OF DESIGN SINCE EVERYTHING WHICH HE HAD SEEN BY US MODERNS WAS FAR REMOVED FROM THE PERFECTION OF THE ANCIENTS
HE ON HIS SIDE CAME CLOSER TO THE WALL AND WHEN WE WERE NOW WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER I PERCEIVED BY HIS GESTURES THAT HE HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO DO ME MISCHIEF AND SEEING ME ALONE THUS THOUGHT HE SHOULD SUCCEED
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR THE EIGHT IN AN EXTRAORDINARY MEETING CAUSED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL BANS WHICH EVER WERE HEARD OF TO BE PUBLISHED AGAINST ME ANNOUNCING HEAVY PENALTIES AGAINST WHO SHOULD HARBOUR ME OR KNOW WHERE I WAS WITHOUT REGARD TO PLACE OR TO THE QUALITY OF MY PROTECTOR
LXXXVIII WHEN I REACHED ROME AND HAD ENJOYED THE COMPANY OF MY FRIENDS AWHILE I BEGAN THE DUKES MEDAL
THIS EXCELLENT WORKMAN LIKE LUCAGNOLO ROUSED IN ME SOME HONEST RIVALRY ALTHOUGH THE ART HE PRACTISED IS FAR REMOTE FROM THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOLD-SMITHERY AND CONSEQUENTLY LAUTIZIO WAS NOT SKILLED IN MAKING ANYTHING BUT SEALS
HE OWNS SOME GOOD PROPERTY AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT A MILE
WHEN HE FOUND THEY PAID NO HEED TO HIS LOUD BARKING HE DRAGGED THEIR BED-CLOTHES OFF
LXXX WHEN I REACHED ROME I WENT TO LODGE IN BINDO ALTOVITIS HOUSE
AND AFTER RUBBING A LITTLE BACON FAT INTO HER WORST WOUNDS THEY ATE WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE MEAT TOGETHER
HAVE YOU ONLY JUST LEARNED THAT THERE IS NO REMEDY AGAINST DEATH
FOR I SHALL THEN BE ABLE TO GIVE SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AS WILL MAKE HIM MARVEL. THIS BAD TURN HAD BEEN DONE ME BY GIORGETTO VASSELLARIO OF AREZZO 2 THE PAINTER
HE RESPONDED BY TELLING ME HOW HER MAJESTY OF FRANCE WAS MOST EAGER TO COMPLETE THE MONUMENT OF HER HUSBAND HENRI II AND HOW DANIELLO DA VOLTERRA 1 HAD UNDERTAKEN A GREAT EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN BRONZE BUT THE TIME HAD ALREADY ELAPSED IN WHICH HE PROMISED TO PERFORM IT AND THAT A MULTITUDE OF THE RICHEST ORNAMENTS WERE REQUIRED FOR THE TOMB
I REPLIED THAT I HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM I SHOULD CARRY IT OUT FOR ONE WHO WAS WORTHY OF IT
WHILE HE WAS STILL PURSUING HIS CURE HE NEVER OMITTED HIS STUDIES AND I PROVIDED HIM WITH BOOKS ACCORDING TO THE MEANS AT MY DISPOSAL
THERE I BEHELD THE MEN WHOM I HAD LEFT EREWHILE IN SUCH HIGH SPIRITS STANDING STUPEFIED AND DOWNCAST
STILL UP TO THIS TIME SBIETTA HAD NOT PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE
AND THE ROCKS WERE PARTLY ENAMELLED PARTLY LEFT IN GOLD
CAL
WITH TIME LITTLE BY LITTLE MY FACULTIES RETURNED AND I PERCEIVED THAT I WAS OUTSIDE THE CASTLE AND IN A FLASH REMEMBERED ALL MY ADVENTURES
THEY SHOW THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE BENT IN AN ANGLE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN BROKEN
ASK THE DUKE
MY FILIAL PIETY OFTEN MADE ME GIVE HIM THAT CONTENTMENT AND INDUCE ME TO PRETEND THAT I ENJOYED THE MUSIC TOO
IF YOU OFFER ANY RESISTANCE TO WHAT I SHALL PROPOSE UPON THE SLIGHTEST WORD YOU UTTER I WILL STAB YOU TILL YOUR GUTS RUN OUT UPON THIS FLOOR. HE ANSWERED
BUT NICCOLò BENINTENDI SHOUTED
THEN WE DINED TOGETHER JOYFULLY
IT WAS THE VERY MAN WHO HAD ABUSED HIM SO RUDELY AND WHO SWORE THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SENT INTO THE COUNTRY WITH THE LANCES
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I TOLD AMMANATOS MESSENGER I HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED IT WOULD TURN OUT THUS
SO THAT THE ORB REMAINED QUITE CLEAR WITHOUT ITS RAYS AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE IT WITH VAST DELIGHT
YOU FOLLOWING THE IMPULSE OF YOUR OWN MIND ONLY HAD A THOUSAND GOLDEN DUCATS TOLD OUT FOR ME TO EXECUTE THE PIECE WITHAL THANKING ME IN ADDITION FOR MY HINT
PYXES LIKE THIS ONE OF TOBBIAS WILL SUIT THEIR TASTE WELL AND THESE TOO CAN BE FINISHED QUICKER
THOU KNOWEST THAT MY OBJECT IN THIS JOURNEY IS ONLY TO CARRY ALMS TO SIX POOR MISERABLE VIRGINS AND THEIR MOTHER MY OWN SISTER
AND THE BALL STRIKING THE ARCH OF THE DOOR AND GLANCING BACKWARDS WOUNDED HIM IN THE THROAT SO THAT HE FELL DEAD TO EARTH
AND NOT KNOWING HOW ELSE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM THIS ENTANGLEMENT HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING GIVEN SUCH AN ORDER
2 THEY WERE RICHLY CHASED SO FAR AS THAT SORT OF WORK ADMITS
I HAD LEFT MY LINES SOME LITTLE WAY BEHIND
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MEANING OF COMPARE CON RISERVO DI TRE ANNI CELLINI ELSEWHERE USES THE EQUIVALENT TERM PATTO RESOLUTIVO SEE TASSI VOL
I KNOW THOSE TWO MEN THERE VERY WELL
THEN THE IMPUDENT BAGGAGE ENTERED INTO PLAIN AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAILS REGARDING ALL THE FILTH SHE LYINGLY ACCUSED ME OF
GO AND ASK BENVENUTO IF HIS COLOSSAL STATUE IS FAR ENOUGH FORWARD FOR HIM TO GRATIFY US WITH A GLANCE AT IT. MESSER GIANSTEFANO DISCHARGED THIS EMBASSY WITH GREAT TACT AND IN THE MOST COURTEOUS TERMS
I SACRIFICED MY PAY FOR HIS PORTRAIT TOGETHER WITH THE BRONZE AND WE ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD KEEP MY MONEY AT 15 PER CENT
AND HE JUDGED IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED
CELLINI ONLY SPOKE THE TRUTH ON THIS OCCASION
1 TAKING MESSER GIOVANNI AND ME APART HE TOLD US THAT THE CARDINAL HAD REPORTED TO HIM WHAT THE POPE SAID AND THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF HELPING ME OUT OF THE SCRAPE
ADVANCED TOWARD CHAMPAGNE AND THREATENED PARIS WHILE THE ENGLISH WERE BESIEGING BOULOGNE
I MADE ASCANIO AND PAGOLO GUARDIANS OF MY CASTLE AND ALL MY PROPERTY INCLUDING TWO LITTLE VASES WHICH WERE ONLY JUST BEGUN
THIS I FOUND TO BE TRUE
NOT BEING AWARE THAT HE WAS THEIR CLOSE RELATIVE I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT ARBITRATOR AND THEREFORE PLACED MYSELF ALSO ABSOLUTELY IN HIS HANDS
AT THIS DISPUTE BETWEEN US THERE WERE PRESENT THE TREASURERS AND OTHER GENTLEFOLK COMMISSIONED BY THE KING TO SUPERINTEND MY PROCEEDINGS
I NEVER LEFT HIS SIDE UNTIL SOME BRAVE SOLDIERS CAME FROM THE GATE SAN GALLO AND RESCUED ME FROM THE RAGING CROWD
THEN TURNED TO ONE OF HIS GENTLEMEN CALLED MESSER PIER ANTONIO PECCI OF SIENA ORDERING HIM TO TELL THE BARGELLO NOT TO TOUCH ME
THIS EXCELLENT MAN WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
FOR THIS IS NOT USUAL IN TURKISH WORK
PRIMATICCIO TOGETHER WITH ROSSO INTRODUCED ITALIAN PAINTING INTO FRANCE
BENVENUTO OH
FOR THE DIAMOND I WAS PAID ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CROWNS AND NO MORE
HE DIED IN 1558 AGED SIXTY-FIVE YEARS
IN THE GUILD OF THE GOLDSMITHS THEY HAD THREE BIG SHOPS AND DROVE A THRIVING TRADE
OH HOW WILL GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME AND MY SINS IF I DO NOT PARDON THOSE WHO HAVE DONE ME THE GREATEST INJURIES
HE OUGHT NEVER TO STOP WORKING. THEN HE TURNED TO ME WITH A BEAMING COUNTENANCE AND TOLD ME THAT HE GREATLY LIKED THE PIECE AND WISHED ME TO EXECUTE IT IN GOLD
ACCORDINGLY I CALLED MY ELDER SERVANT CENCIO 1 HE WAS THE MAN I TOOK INTO THE NECROMANTIC CIRCLE AND BADE HIM TO GO AND SEE WHO THE MADMAN WAS THAT KNOCKED SO BRUTALLY AT THAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT
NOW THE DUCHESS HAD SENT TO SEE WHAT HIS EXCELLENCY WAS DOING AND HER PAGE BROUGHT BACK THIS ANSWER
CII SIGNOR PIER LUIGI THE POPES SON HAD WELL CONSIDERED THE LARGE SUM FOR WHICH I STOOD ACCUSED
THEY HAVE OBTAINED THIS NAME OF GROTESQUES AMONG THE MODERNS THROUGH BEING FOUND IN CERTAIN SUBTERRANEAN CAVERNS IN ROME BY STUDENTS OF ANTIQUITY
AND HOW FAR MORE HE THEN WHO RECEIVED THE PROVOCATION I HAVE HEARD OF? WHEN MY SAFE CONDUCT HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT I BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE HIM AND WAS TREATED WITH THE UTMOST FAVOUR
AND IN THE END THEY SHUT THEIR ROOMS TIGHT
IN THE EXCESS OF HIS JOY IT SEEMED A THOUSAND YEARS TO MY FATHER TILL HE SHOULD MEET THE MEMBER OF THE EIGHT WHO HAD INSULTED HIM
I SAID THAT A HUNDRED CROWNS OF GOLD APIECE WOULD BE QUITE PROPER AND THAT I WOULD MAKE THEM EARN THEIR WAGES WELL
203 NOTE
BUT I THINK THE VERSION IN MY SENSE IS MORE TRUE BOTH TO ITALIAN AND TO CELLINIS SPECIAL STYLE
I GAVE HIM ONLY ONE WORD BACK FOR ANSWER WHICH WAS THAT--I KNEW ALL
BUT BY BUACCIO HE GENERALLY MEANS BACCIO BANDINELLI
NOW HE POSSESSED SEVERAL PAIRS OF PINCERS AMONG WHICH WAS ONE BOTH BIG AND HEAVY
GRATTARE IL CORPO WHICH I HAVE TRANSLATED SCRATCH YOUR PAUNCH IS EQUIVALENT TO TWIRL YOUR THUMBS NOTE 2
BUT WHEN I HAD ARRANGED THE WHOLE MACHINE AND WAS APPROACHING TO PUT IT IN MOTION JUST AT THE MOMENT OF MY SETTING MY HAND TO IT I WAS SEIZED BY AN INVISIBLE POWER AND FLUNG FOUR CUBITS FROM THE SPOT IN SUCH A TERROR THAT I LAY HALF DEAD
11 THE CRUEL CHIEF WAS HE OF ROBBERS BROOD WORST OF THE WORST AMONG A GANG OF KNAVES
BUT I TOLD THEM THAT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO MEDITATE THIS STEP IN SOLITUDE ALTHOUGH I VERY MUCH INCLINED TO THEIR OPINION
BUT AS GOD HAS PROMISED TO THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM IT TURNED OUT EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO HER CALCULATIONS
THIS INDEED WAS OBVIOUS BECAUSE HE HAD ACQUIRED NO SKILL IN THE ARTS
THE NEXT MORNING I SAW ASCANIO WORKING AT SOME TRIFLES IN WIRE AT HIS MASTERS SIDE
SO THEY BORE ME TO TORRE DI NONA SUCH IS THE NAME OF THE PLACE AND PUT ME IN THE CONDEMNED CELL
AND DEEMING I HAD SHOWN MYSELF A MAN OF TALENT INDULGED A BOASTFUL HUMOUR
BUT HE SHOWED THE STRONGEST DESIRE TO HAVE THE WORK DONE AND THE MOST PERFECT WILLINGNESS TO ARRANGE PRELIMINARIES
AND WHEREAS HE HAD FORMERLY GIVEN ORDERS THAT THEY SHOULD SEE I DID NOT FLY FROM ROME HE NOW TOLD THEM TO LOOK WELL ABOUT AND HAVE NO HEED OF ME SEEING HE WAS ILL-DISPOSED TO ANGER ME AND IN THIS WAY RUN THE RISK OF LOSING ME
I WANT YOU AND NOT THEM
LOOK AT THAT BOX WHICH HAS BEEN SENT ME BY MY LORD STEFANO OF PALESTRINA
AFTER INSPECTING THIS MOST SPLENDID BLOCK I MEASURED IT IN EVERY DIRECTION AND ON RETURNING TO FLORENCE MADE SEVERAL LITTLE MODELS SUITED TO ITS PROPORTIONS
HE ASKED WHO I WAS USING TERMS LIKE THESE
MESSER PIER ANTONIO REPLIED THAT HE WAS VERY ILL AND THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY BE EVEN WORSE
ONCE MORE HIS EXCELLENCY BEGAN TO ADDRESS ME WITH THE GREATEST COURTESY
HE WAS NOT GOING TO BREAK HIS WORD
GO AND COME BACK AGAIN FOR OF A TRUTH YOU PLEASE ME
IS NOT THIS BOAT ENGAGED FOR US? YES, SAID LAMENTONE
HE WAS VERY EAGER TO HAVE IT AND USED TO SEND FOR ME TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO INSPECT IT
THIS HINT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME AND NEXT MORNING I HAD RECOURSE TO ARMS
AND I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF
GO THEN AND MAKE A DESIGN YOURSELF AND I WILL SEE IF IT SATISFIES ME. ACCORDINGLY I MADE TWO DESIGNS ACCORDING TO THE RIGHT PRINCIPLES FOR FORTIFYING THOSE TWO GATES AND TOOK THEM TO HIM
AND OUR ADMIRABLE LIONARDO HAD CHOSEN TO DEPICT A BATTLE OF HORSES WITH THE CAPTURE OF SOME STANDARDS IN AS DIVINE A STYLE AS COULD POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED
SO THAT AT LAST HE WORE ME OUT
PUGNAL PISTOLESE IT CAME IN TIME TO MEAN A CUTLASS
SO THEN RAISE YOUR EYES. WHEN HE HAD RAISED THEM HE CRIED OUT
THE BREADTH WAS ABOUT TWELVE PACES
2 WE ARE ALL INDIGNANT
WHEREAS WHAT BANDINELLO SAID IS BUT A PORTION OF THE EVIL OUT OF WHICH HE IS COMPOSED. THE DUKE LISTENED WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT
4 MY BELOVED FRIEND DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER OF LEAVING ME AND THAT COME WHAT MIGHT IN LIFE OR DEATH HE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT WAS HIS DUTY TOWARD A FRIEND
HE REPLIED THAT FOR A FIRST ESSAY HE SHOULD LIKE ME TO PRODUCE A PERSEUS
IF I DID NOT PAY YOU I SHOULD BE AN UTTER ROGUE. I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO HEAR HIM SPEAK IN THAT WAY
WHILE INSPECTING THESE THINGS IT CAME INTO HIS HEAD THAT THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA HAD FULFILLED NONE OF HIS PROMISES TO ME EITHER AS REGARDED A PENSION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THAT IN THE SPACE OF ONE MONTH YOU WILL BE WHERE SHE IS? THEN ONCE MORE HE PRAYED ME TO STAND FIRM BY HIM BECAUSE THE LEGIONS WERE A THOUSANDFOLD MORE THAN HE HAD SUMMONED AND WERE THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL THE DENIZENS OF HELL
AND AT LAST I HAD THEM LOCKED OFF AND GAINED THEREBY THEIR DEEP ILL-WILL
THE MEDICI HERE MENTIONED WERE LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT AND HIS SON PIETRO WHO WAS EXPELLED FROM FLORENCE IN THE YEAR 1494
1 IT MARCHES WITH MY PROPERTY OF LA FONTE
SO I RETURNED TO CORNAROS PALACE AND A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE CARDINAL FARNESE WAS ELECTED POPE
AND ALTHOUGH I WAS STAYING IN HIS HOUSE HE WAS NEVER GOOD-HUMOURED BUT ALWAYS SURLY
BUT THAT CASE IN WHICH I SAID I HAD SO MANY JEWELS AND OTHER LIES IS ALL FULL OF CAVIARE. ON HEARING THIS I COULD NOT HOLD FROM LAUGHING
HAPPENING TO SPEAK ONE DAY WITH THE GOOD KING ABOUT MY MATTERS SHE ABUSED ME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE SWORE IN ORDER TO APPEASE HER HE WOULD TAKE NO MORE HEED OF ME THENCEFORWARD THAN IF HE HAD NEVER SET EYES UPON MY FACE
THE POPE HAD SENT FOR HIM TO GIVE ORDERS ABOUT SOME JEWELS
BUT LET NONE EVER LAUGH AT THE PROGNOSTICATIONS OF ANY WORTHY MAN WHOM HE HAS WRONGFULLY INSULTED
THERE HE CAN ATTEND TO HIS RECOVERY AND I WILL NOT PREVENT ANY OF HIS FRIENDS FROM COMING TO VISIT HIM
AT THAT TIME THE KING CAME TO PARIS
HOWEVER IT WAS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE TO MAKE A LARGER
THIS AND OTHER CAUSES MADE HER HATE THE VERY SIGHT OF ME
AND THERE WERE OTHER ORNAMENTS BESIDES WHICH MADE A VERY BEAUTIFUL EFFECT
EVERY DAY I USED TO RIDE OUT ALONE ALONG THE SEASHORE WHERE I DISMOUNTED AND FILLED MY POCKETS WITH ALL SORTS OF PEBBLES SNAIL SHELLS AND SEA SHELLS OF GREAT RARITY AND BEAUTY
IN THE NEXT PLACE YOU KNOW THAT POOR YOUNG GIRL CATERINA
SO I HAD TO CUT INTO THE WOOD
THEY MADE THEIR MINDS UP TO HAVE THE LAW OF ME AND CONSULTED A NORMAN ADVOCATE WHO ADVISED THEM TO DECLARE THAT I HAD USED THE GIRL AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION
CELLINI MEANWHILE HAD A RIGHT TO PRIZE IT SINCE IT REVEALED TO HIM WHAT FRIENDSHIP WAS PREPARED TO UTTER AFTER HIS DECEASE
THE PEASANTS USED TO SELL THINGS OF THIS SORT TO THE TRADERS FOR A MERE TRIFLE
ALL THIS HAPPENED ON THE LAST DAY OF OCTOBER IN DAUPHINé AT A CASTLE THE NAME OF WHICH I DO NOT REMEMBER
NICCOLò DA MONTE AGUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINO FOR IT
YET OH
WHETHER LED BY HIS OWN SUSPICIONS OR BY THE ADVICE OF OTHERS I CANNOT SAY
GIO MARIA DEL MONTE SANSOVINO WAS ELECTED POPE WITH THE TITLE OF JULIUS III IN FEBRUARY 1550
THE LITTLE I HAD TO DO THERE COULD BE DONE BY HIMSELF WITHOUT THROWING MONEY AWAY ON OTHER PEOPLE
AND THUS HE WENT ON CONVERSING FOR SOME TIME VERY PLEASANTLY
THE DEATH OF THE CASTELLAN WAS DRAWING NEAR
BUT PRAY TELL ME AT LEAST HOW MUCH YOU PAID IN ORDER THAT I MAY LEARN TO UNDERSTAND IT ACCORDING TO THE WAY OF YOUR EXCELLENCY. THE DUKE ROSE AND WITH A LITTLE SORT OF ANGRY GRIN REPLIED
CARADOSSO BEGAN TO MAKE ME ONE BUT DID NOT FINISH IT
HER HUSBAND BY REASON OF DIVERS CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CITY HAD LOST EMPLOYMENT FROM HIS TRADE
I MOUNTED WITH AN ARQUEBUSE UPON THE SADDLE-BOW WOUND UP IN READINESS TO FIRE IF NEED WERE
WE HAD CLIMBED A LITTLE WAY WHEN ASCANIOS HORSE AN EXCELLENT BEAST OF HUNGARIAN RACE MADE A FALSE STEP
AND NOW THAT I AM HERE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE FINISHED HALF THE JOURNEY. AND SO BEING OF ONE ACCORD WE PURSUED OUR WAY TOGETHER SAYING OH WHAT WILL OUR OLD FOLKS SAY THIS EVENING? WE THEN MADE AN AGREEMENT NOT TO THINK MORE ABOUT THEM TILL WE REACHED ROME
IT IS FOUND WRITTEN IN CHRONICLES MADE BY OUR ANCESTORS OF FLORENCE MEN OF OLD TIME AND OF CREDIBILITY EVEN AS GIOVANNI VILLANI WRITES THAT THE CITY OF FLORENCE WAS EVIDENTLY BUILT IN IMITATION OF THE FAIR CITY OF ROME
INDEED THE EMPEROR COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SMILING AT HIM
MEANWHILE AS I COULD NOT DO EVERYTHING ALONE I LOOKED ABOUT FOR WORKMEN IN ORDER TO PUT THE BUSINESS QUICKLY THROUGH
HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO RELY UPON I REMAINED IN DESPAIR AND MISERY
ON THEIR ARRIVAL WE WERE INTRODUCED AND MICHELETTO AND POMPEO IMMEDIATELY UNROLLED THEIR PAPERS WHICH THE POPE INSPECTED
TWAS HE SUBDUED MY CRUEL FORTUNES SPITE
AT FIRST I THOUGHT OF LOPPING OFF AN ARM OF HIS
SEE PLON P
TO PROVE THAT THIS IS SO LOOK HERE
FOR HIS HOLINESS HAD ORDERED ANOTHER COIN OF THE VALUE OF TWO CARLINS ON WHICH HIS OWN PORTRAIT WAS STAMPED WHILE THE REVERSE BORE A FIGURE OF CHRIST UPON THE WATERS HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO S
NO SOONER HAD HE GOT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH THAN THE DIRTY PIG LET FLY FOUR CRACKS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FROM SAN MINIATO
THIS MADE HER GRUMBLE WITH REDOUBLED SPITE
PASSATOJACCI NOTE 3
HERE SHOW ME YOUR SKETCH! IT WAS A SINGLE UNICORNS HEAD PROPORTIONED IN SIZE TO THE HORN
HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT
FELICE WHO LOVED ME MOST AFFECTIONATELY RAN WEEPING AND CRYING
I SAW IT AND RAN UP TO IT AND LAID MY HANDS UPON IT
1 FOR MY GREAT KING AS I HAVE SAID I HAD BEEN WORKING STRENUOUSLY AND THE THIRD DAY AFTER HE RETURNED TO PARIS HE CAME TO MY HOUSE ATTENDED BY A CROWD OF HIS CHIEF NOBLES
1 POPE CLEMENT HAD SENT TO GET SOME TROOPS FROM GIOVANNI DE MEDICI AND WHEN THEY CAME THEY MADE SUCH DISTURBANCES IN ROME THAT IT WAS ILL LIVING IN OPEN SHOPS
TO THIS I REPLIED THAT I HAD NOT DONE FOR HIM AS MUCH AS I DESIRED BUT ONLY WHAT I COULD AND THAT IT WAS THE DUTY OF HUMAN BEINGS TO BE MUTUALLY SERVICEABLE
YOU EXCEED THE BOUNDS OF DECENCY
MY LORD I ENTREAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO LEND A PATIENT HEARING WHILE I SPEAK FOUR WORDS IN YOUR SERVICE. HE TOLD ME TO SAY ALL I WANTED AND THAT HE WOULD LISTEN
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN CIVILITIES WHICH MADE ME DO FAR BETTER WITH THIS BASTION THAN WITH THE OTHER
SPRINGING UPON MY FOLLOWERS THE ONE WHO HAD THE SPONTOON SMOTE PAGOLO THE ROMAN FIRST ABOVE THE LEFT NIPPLE
AS FOR THE SALT-CELLAR I THOUGHT IF MY MEMORY DOES NOT BETRAY ME THAT YOUR MAJESTY ON ONE OCCASION ORDERED ME TO MAKE IT OF YOUR OWN ACCORD
SO I TOOK MY CAPE UP AND BEFORE I LEFT THE SHOP I TURNED TO AN IMAGE OF CHRIST WITH SOLEMN REVERENCE AND CAP IN HAND PRAYING AS THUS
AND HIS TEMPER RISING HE EXCLAIMED
THEY ROSE AT ONCE WITH GENIAL ASSENT LEFT THE WORKSHOP AND ON ENTERING THE HOUSE BEHELD MY LITTLE MODEL OF THE NEPTUNE AND THE FOUNTAIN WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN BY THE DUCHESS
I MIGHT LEAVE IT WITHOUT FARTHER THOUGHT TO HIM AND EVEN IF I CHOSE MIGHT SET OFF AT ONCE BECAUSE HE WOULD ACT FOR THE BEST IN MY INTEREST WITH THE KING
ALL THE REST OF MY TIME I WOULD GIVE TO MUSIC ONLY WITH THE VIEW OF SATISFYING HIS DESIRE
THE WORK IS MINE AND SINCE IT HAS BEEN GIVEN ME I DO NOT CHOOSE TO PUT WHAT IS MY OWN TO HAZARD. TO THIS I RETORTED
MY BENVENUTO YOU KNOW THAT I AM ACTING IN YOUR INTEREST
FOR HEAVENS SAKE MR TREASURER LET ME HAVE BUT ONE GLASS OF WINE AND A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD
I BADE HIM STAND BACK ELSE ID MURDER HIM
REFLECT UPON IT MY LADY
I THREW THE SHEATH AWAY AND WITH THE PONIARD CUT A PIECE OF THE LINEN WHICH I HAD LEFT
IT MADE FOR MY GOOD FORTUNE THAT I TOOK THIS BASKET AND NOT A BAG
THEREUPON THE FELLOW CALLED OUT THAT I MIGHT PAY THEM OUT OF MY OWN POCKET
SO I MOUNTED MY HORSE AND WITH TWO SERVANTS TO ATTEND ME RETURNED TO THE CASTLE WHERE I ALL BUT CAUGHT PAGOLO AND THAT LITTLE WRETCH CATERINA IN FLAGRANTE NO SOONER HAD I REACHED THE PLACE THAN THAT FRENCH BAWD HER MOTHER SCREAMED OUT
PROBABLY DOMENICO IACOBACCI WHO OBTAINED THE HAT IN 1517
WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF PERSEUS AND SAID IT HAD NOT COME OUT PERFECT JUST AS I PREVIOUSLY WARNED HIS EXCELLENCY I SAW AN EXPRESSION OF WONDER PASS OVER HIS FACE WHILE HE RELATED TO THE DUCHESS HOW I HAD PREDICTED THIS BEFOREHAND
BUT AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID I HAD BECOME SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH TROUBLES OF THIS SORT THAT I WAS INCAPABLE OF FEAR AND NOTHING ANY LONGER COULD DISTURB ME
I HAD NOT SPOKEN TWICE IN MY LIFETIME TO THAT LITTLE SIMPLETON OF A CARDINAL DE GADDI
PEOPLE WHO WERE ANYWHERE ELSE BUT WHERE WE WERE COULD NOT HAVE FORMED THE LEAST IMAGINATION OF WHAT IT WAS
HE IS ALIVE BUT YOU SHALL DIE THIS MINUTE. THEN RAISING HIS HAND HE STRUCK TWO BLOWS WITH THE SCIMITAR BOTH AT THE FELLOWS HEAD
BROTHER THIS IS THE GREATEST SORROW AND THE GREATEST TRIAL THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY LIFE
BUT DURING THOSE DISCOURSES I CONTRIVED TO MAKE A GOOD MEAL
MOST BLESSED FATHER BENVENUTO IS BUT YOUNG
AND YET YOU HAVE KILLED MEN ENOUGH HERE! I REPLIED
WHEN THIS RECEPTION WAS OVER WE FOUND THE WHOLE ROOM FULL OF SONNETS WHICH EVERY MAN OF US HAD MADE AND SENT TO MICHEL AGNOLO MY LAD BEGAN TO READ THEM AND READ THEM ALL ALOUD SO GRACEFULLY THAT HIS INFINITE CHARMS WERE HEIGHTENED BEYOND THE POWERS OF LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE
IN RETURN I NEVER RAISED MY EYES TO LOOK AT HIM NOR ANSWERED WORD FOR WORD
IT IS BEAUTIFULLY REPRESENTED BY TWO PHOTOGRAVURES IN PLONS GREAT BOOK ON CELLINI
AT THE END OF THOSE GREAT TROUBLES THE KING CAME TO TAKE HIS EASE AWHILE IN PARIS
I WAS TERRIBLY DISGUSTED TO FIND THERE WAS NO EXIT FROM THIS TRAP
AFTER THE CAPTURE OF TUNIS THE EMPEROR PASSED THROUGH PARIS WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW KING FRANCIS 1 WHO WANTED TO PRESENT HIM WITH SOMETHING WORTHY OF SO GREAT A POTENTATE
DOMENICO POGGINI AND GIANPAGOLO HIS BROTHER WHO ARE PRESENT WILL CONFIRM MY WORDS
THIS HAD BEEN CONSIGNED TO ME TOGETHER WITH THE FARM ABOVE MENTIONED WHICH BEARS THE NAME OF DELLA FONTE
BENVENUTO YOU ARE A GREAT FOOL
WHOSO HATH GOTTEN THE POOR FOLK IN BAN ID MAKE HIM LEARN THOSE LESSONS OF THE JAIL
ONLY THINK MADAM ALL THE TIMES THAT HE HAS COME TO ME OR THAT I HAVE COME TO HIM HE HAS NEVER ONCE ASKED FOR ANYTHING
I ASSURE YOU THAT BEFORE I CARRY MY COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE KING I SHALL DEFEND MY RIGHT IN THE WAY HIS MAJESTY GAVE ME ORDERS TWO DAYS SINCE TO DO
WE POSSESS HIS SONNETS OF THE PERSEUS
I TOO SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE FLIGHT
MADDENED BY THE PAIN HE SWORE LOUDER THAN ALL THE REST IN HIS PERUGIAN JARGON CRYING OUT
I WENT TO SIENA WISHING TO LOOK UP A CERTAIN WORTHY MAN CALLED MAESTRO FRANCESCO CASTORO
HE SET THE WORK UP BADLY AND MOREOVER CEASED TO LABOUR AT IT SO THAT I LOST MORE TIME THAN IF I HAD TAKEN IT IN HAND MYSELF
AND THIS ALONE OUGHT TO SUFFICE THEM
5 BUT IF I COMPLETED IT ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE THEN I WAS WILLING TO HAVE IT VALUED AND TO BE PAID ONE THOUSAND CROWNS LESS THAN THE ESTIMATE MADE BY EXPERTS
THEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
WHEN HE DREW UP HE SAID
AFTER SUNRISE MY WORKMEN WENT INTO THE SHOP AND SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN BROKEN OPEN AND ALL THE BOXES SMASHED
AND IN GODS GOOD TIME I WILL RENDER YOU PROOF OF THIS
THINKING HE HAD CONVINCED ME LUCAGNOLO REPLIED
BUT I BEGGED HIM TO PROCURE FOR ME AN AUDIENCE WITH THE CASTELLAN FOR I MEANT TO EXPLAIN FRANKLY HOW THE MATTER STOOD WHICH WAS OF FAR MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN THEY IMAGINED
LESS THAN THIS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT WITH THESE EYES OF MINE AND IN THAT THRONE OF GOD
YOU HAVE BEEN LAUGHING OVER WHAT I FEAR MAY MAKE YOU WEEP
HE HAD HOWEVER DECIDED TO DO ONE OR OTHER OF TWO THINGS-EITHER TO HAVE ME ASSASSINATED OR TO HAVE ME TAKEN UP BY THE BARGELLO
AND HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HIS OLD FLAME PANTASILEA
WHEN POMPEO HAD STOOD THERE TIME ENOUGH TO SAY TWO AVE MARIAS HE LAUGHED DERISIVELY IN MY DIRECTION
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO AID YOU! I REPLIED
BESIDES AS IT WAS GOOD FRIDAY I IMAGINED THAT THE MADNESSES OF MADMEN MIGHT BE GIVING THEMSELVES A HOLIDAY
HOWEVER I MADE MY MIND UP TO DISOBEY THEIR ORDERS OBSERVED THE SAME DIET AS I HAD FORMERLY ADOPTED AND AFTER DRINKING THE DECOCTION FOUR DAYS WAS WHOLLY RID OF FEVER
DESPATCH MY BUSINESS QUICKLY
SO I FELT SURE 2 THAT HE WOULD ESCAPE WITHOUT MISCHIEF
MANY A TIME I HAD IT IN MY SOUL TO CAST MYSELF AWAY FOR LOST
BUT YOUR BANDINELLO GOT OUT OF IT ONLY TWO FIGURES BOTH ILL-EXECUTED AND BUNGLED IN THE WORST MANNER
HE ASSURED THEM THAT THE JOB WOULD BE AS EASY AS SUCKING A FRESH EGG
WITH ALL MY HEART I THANK YOU AND TAKE GOOD LEAVE OF YOU
THEREUPON MESSER DURANTE ADVANCED IN SO GRACELESS A MANNER AND DELIVERED HIS SPEECH WITH SO MUCH OF BRESCIAN LINGO MUMBLING HIS WORDS OVER IN HIS MOUTH THAT ONE NEVER SAW OR HEARD ANYTHING WORSE
AND THAT IF THEIR LORDSHIPS THOUGHT I HAD I ACKNOWLEDGED MYSELF TO BE MOST AMPLY REWARDED
MY LADY
HE GOT THE HAT IN 1534 AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
THIS INDUCED OUR ADVERSARIES WHEN THEY SAW THEIR PASSAGE COVERED BY MY GUNS TO LOAD THE ROOF OF A CERTAIN HOUSE ONE NIGHT WITH THIRTY GABIONS WHICH OBSTRUCTED THE VIEW I FORMERLY ENJOYED
NOT EVEN THIS DISMAYED ME
WHILE I WAS THUS TERRIBLY AFFLICTED I BEHELD THE FIGURE OF A MAN ENTER MY CHAMBER TWISTED IN HIS BODY INTO THE FORM OF A CAPITAL S
I WAS WELL ARMED WITH SHIRT AND SLEEVES OF MAIL AND HAVING MY SWORD AND DAGGER AT MY SIDE MADE OFF ALONG THE STREET AS QUICK AS MY TWO LEGS WOULD CARRY ME
OH GLORIOUS THY VIRTUE
A POPULAR BALLAD OF THE TIME
THIS IS THE FAMOUS GIORGIO VASARI A BAD PAINTER AND WORSE ARCHITECT BUT DEAR TO ALL LOVERS OF THE ARTS FOR HIS ANECDOTIC WORK UPON ITALIAN ARTISTS
BUT THE BEST THAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME WOULD BE TO DRIVE THAT MISERABLE MATTIO FROM MY SIDE WHO IS LAUGHING AT MY AFFLICTION AFTERWARDS IF YOUR LORDSHIP DEIGNS TO VISIT ME AGAIN LET ME BEG YOU TO COME WITH MESSER ANTONIO ALLEGRETTI OR WITH MESSER ANNIBAL CARO OR WITH SOME OTHER OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHED FRIENDS WHO ARE PERSONS OF QUITE DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE AND DISCRETION FROM THAT BEAST. THEREUPON MESSER GIOVANNI TOLD MATTIO IN JEST TO TAKE HIMSELF OUT OF HIS SIGHT FOR EVER
FOR THEY ALL AGREED IN BLESSING MY HANDS 1 JUDGING THAT POMPEO HAD DONE ME TOO GREAT AND UNFORGIVABLE AN INJURY AND MARVELLING THAT I HAD PUT UP WITH HIM SO LONG
THE POISON FROM THE BAD AIR OF THOSE MARSHES FIRST ATTACKED THE CARDINAL WHO WAS TAKEN WITH A PESTILENTIAL FEVER AFTER A FEW DAYS AND DIED AT THE END OF A BRIEF ILLNESS
THEN WHEN I BEGAN TO FIRE THE RAIN STOPPED AND AT THE FOURTH DISCHARGE THE SUN SHONE OUT
MAESTRO DELLE STAMPE DELLA ZECCA I
HE SAYS THAT YOU MUST BRING YOUR WORK TO ME HERE AND THAT AFTER I HAVE SEEN IT PUT INTO A BOX AND SEALED I MUST TAKE IT TO HIM
AND SO SOLOSMEO AND I WENT ON OUR WAY SINGING TOWARD MONTE CASSINO INTENDING TO PURSUE OUR JOURNEY THENCE IN COMPANY TOWARD NAPLES
BUT THIS TIME THE CONTRACT WAS DRAWN UP AND SIGNED
AND VERY MUCH TO MY OWN PLEASURE I USED IT SEVERAL TIMES BY THE WAY PERFORMING INCREDIBLE FEATS BY MEANS OF IT
PAGOLO
THE PAPAL DATARIO WAS THE CHIEF SECRETARY OF THE OFFICE FOR REQUESTS PETITIONS AND PATENTS
MARIA NOVELLA EVEN THOUGH THE OVERSEERS OF THE FABRIC CAME AND BEGGED ME FOR THE CRUCIFIX
WHILE HE WAS YET A LAD AND LIVING IN FLORENCE THEY USED IN CERTAIN PLACES OF THE CITY TO MEET TOGETHER DURING THE NIGHTS OF SUMMER ON THE PUBLIC STREETS
VI FOR MORE PARTICULARS ABOUT THIS ARTIST
I BEGAN AT ONCE TO SPEAK
AND WHILE I WAS DEVOUTLY UTTERING THIS PSALM TO GOD THERE FELL A STONE SO HUGE THAT IT SMASHED THE THICK BRANCHES OF THE PINE UNDER WHICH I HAD RETIRED FOR SAFETY
I SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO DO ALL THIS
I ASKED THE APPRENTICE WHAT HAD BECOME OF MY LAD CENCIO AND WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM IN ATTENDANCE ON ME
HE HAD CHOSEN FOR HIS ACCOMPLICE A REGISTRAR NAMED LUIGI A PADUAN WHO WAS IN THE CASTELLANS SERVICE
AND I HAD DONE MY BEST TO GET MY BROTHER OUT OF THE FRAY BY CALLING TO HIM
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT
THIS WAS THE LARGER TRAIN
TAKE GOOD CARE AND DO NOT FAIL TO COME FOR THE DUKE IS WAITING FOR YOU. IN THIS WAY I CONTINUED ALWAYS WITH THE SAME INCONVENIENCES TO PUT IN AN APPEARANCE ON SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE EVENINGS
I REPLIED THAT I ENTREATED HIM TO DO ME THE FAVOUR OF COMING
AND SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM I NOTICED THAT HIS EYEBALLS WERE ROLLING IN A FRIGHTFUL MANNER ONE LOOKING ONE WAY AND THE OTHER IN ANOTHER
THE HAIRS WERE LONG AND THE WORM WAS VERY UGLY SPECKLED OF DIVERS COLOURS GREEN BLACK AND RED
LIFTING HIS RIGHT HAND HE WAS IN THE ACT OF GIVING THE BENEDICTION
AND ON ITS BEING EXHIBITED TO THE TRADE THE GOLDSMITHS PRAISED ME AS THE BEST YOUNG CRAFTSMAN OF THEIR ART
INTRODUCTORY NOTE AMONG THE VAST NUMBER OF MEN WHO HAVE THOUGHT FIT TO WRITE DOWN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN LIVES THREE OR FOUR HAVE ACHIEVED MASTERPIECES WHICH STAND OUT PREEMINENTLY
SAY TOO THAT I SHALL REWARD HIM IN A WAY WHICH WILL ASTONISH HIM
WHICH CAVERNS WERE FORMERLY CHAMBERS HOT-BATHS CABINETS FOR STUDY HALLS AND APARTMENTS OF LIKE NATURE
BEING ONE DAY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION THEY TOUCHED UPON THE SACK AND THE DEFENCE OF THE CASTLE
2 THESE TWO TOGETHER THEN BEGAN TO INSINUATE THAT THEY HAD SEEN MY MODEL AND DID NOT THINK ME UP TO A WORK OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY IMPORT
THE ITALIAN IS APPOSTò CHE PASSASSI UNA SOMA THE VERB APPOSTARE HAS THE DOUBLE MEANING OF LYING IN WAIT AND ARRANGING SOMETHING ON PURPOSE
WHEREUPON I SPOKE WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO ADVISED ME TO BE OFF AT ONCE
ON THE EVENING OF THAT FEAST-DAY THEN I MADE MY MIND UP TO ESCAPE COME WHAT MIGHT
I MADE ANSWER THAT IN MY HOUSE LIVED MY WIDOWED SISTER AND SIX GIRLS OF HOLY LIFE AND THAT I WANTED NOBODY ELSE THERE
IN THE BACKGROUND I HAD SHOWN PART OF A TEMPLE WHERE WAS DISCORD CHAINED WITH A LOAD OF FETTERS
IN THIS WAY MY PRINCES YOU WILL BE FAR BETTER SERVED AND WILL NOT DISCOURAGE OUR SCHOOL OF ARTISTS
I SHALL NOT TRY TO ROB YOU OF EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND DUCATS AT ONE GO BUT SHALL RATHER SEEK TO EARN THEM BY MY INDUSTRY
FAUSTINA BELONGING TO MY FRIEND I WOULD NOT HAVE TOUCHED HER FOR ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE CEREMONIES THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD COME TO SICILY AND OFFERED TO MAKE TERMS WHICH SHOULD CONTENT ME
THIS WORK TO WHICH THE DUKE HAS PUT ME WILL LAST SEVERAL MONTHS
AFTER OUR MEAL I RECEIVED VISITS FROM THE SEVERAL MEN WHO HAD ASSISTED ME
DID YOU NOT SEND TO TELL ME BY YOUR JOURNEYMAN FRANCESCO THAT IF I WISHED TO WORK IN MARBLE YOU WOULD GIVE ME A BLOCK
1 FOR JUST AS GIVING DIAMONDS A TINT IS THE MOST DELICATE AND DIFFICULT THING IN THE JEWELLERS ART SO IS MILIANO THE GREATEST JEWELLER THAT EVER LIVED AND THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT DIAMOND TO TINT. I REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL THE GREATER GLORY FOR ME TO COMPETE WITH SO ABLE A MASTER IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT PROFESSION
THEN I WILL TAKE MY BIG TWO-HANDED SWORD AND GO WITH YOU WHITHERSOEVER YOU LIKE. WE WENT INSIDE TO SECURE THE GOLD
HE HAD DRUNK HIS BELLYFUL OF WATER AND WAS WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING DROWNED
HE BEGAN TO TALK TO ME IN ITALIAN SAYING HE HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO EXECUTE SEVERAL GREAT WORKS AND THAT HE WOULD SOON GIVE ORDERS WHERE I WAS TO LABOUR AND PROVIDE ME WITH ALL NECESSARIES
BUT I ASK EVERY ONE TO CONSIDER IN WHAT A GRIEVOUS PLIGHT I FOUND MYSELF
SORELY AGAINST MY WILL HAVING TO DRAG MYSELF AWAY FROM THE SPOT I TURNED TO MY ASSISTANTS ABOUT TEN OR MORE IN ALL WHAT WITH MASTER-FOUNDERS HAND-WORKERS COUNTRY-FELLOWS AND MY OWN SPECIAL JOURNEYMEN AMONG WHOM WAS BERNARDINO MANNELLINI OF MUGELLO MY APPRENTICE THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS
AFTERWARDS HE ADDED
CONSEQUENTLY I PAID NO HEED TO THAT
PRAY MY SON DONT GO! BUT THE LAD WITHOUT HEEDING ANY ONE RAN DOWN THE STAIRS
HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY MY VERY DEAR FRIEND LUCA MARTINI WHO PASSED THE LARGER PORTION OF THE DAY WITH ME
IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ONE DAY WE WERE LED TO TALK ABOUT THE ART OF NECROMANCY
OUT WITH YOU OUT WITH YOU
NOW TOUCHING THE PEDESTALS I HAVE TO SAY THAT I MADE THEM BECAUSE I JUDGED THEM NECESSARY TO THE STATUES
LII THE POPE HAD SENT ME ALL THOSE PRECIOUS STONES EXCEPT THE DIAMOND WHICH WAS PAWNED TO CERTAIN GENOESE BANKERS FOR SOME PRESSING NEED HE HAD OF MONEY
WHERETO I ANSWERED THAT YOU HAD PROMISED ME WHENEVER I SENT FOR YOU TO SERVE HIS MAJESTY THAT YOU WOULD COME AT ONCE
ESCAPE FROM THAT RASCAL OF A POPE AND THAT BASTARD HIS SON FOR BOTH ARE BENT ON HAVING YOUR LIFE BY VILLAINY. I HAD HOWEVER MADE MY MIND UP RATHER TO LOSE MY LIFE THAN TO BREAK THE PROMISE I HAD GIVEN THAT GOOD MAN THE CASTELLAN
SO THAT I GLORY IN TRACING MY DESCENT FROM MEN OF VALOUR
WHILE WE WERE THUS TALKING HIS EXCELLENCY WAS IN HIS WARDROBE LOOKING AT A REMARKABLE LITTLE GUN THAT HAD BEEN SENT HIM OUT OF GERMANY
THE FEES OF THIS OFFICE WHICH WAS ALSO CALLED DATARIO BROUGHT IN A LARGE REVENUE TO THE PAPACY
2 AND WHEN I WAS NEAR THE HOUSE I SHOT SOME BIRDS WITH MY ARQUEBUSE
IT IS TRUE THAT THE GREAT DELIGHT I TOOK IN THIS EXERCISE BID FAIR TO WITHDRAW ME FROM MY ART AND STUDIES
ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE NOT FOUND HERE QUITE EVERYTHING YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO LOOK FOR YET PUT YOUR MIND TO REST
BY ADROITLY USING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY HE BRIBED THE PERSON IN WHOSE HANDS IT WAS AND BROUGHT IT WITH HIM TO THESE PARTS
AND THOSE IN WHOM I PLACED THE MOST CONFIDENCE WERE JUST THE MEN WHO PLAYED MOST TRAITOROUSLY
THE TUSCANS AND THE ROMANS MAKE A BETTER CHOICE BECAUSE THEY IMITATE THE LEAVES OF THE ACANTHUS COMMONLY CALLED BEARS-FOOT WITH ITS STALKS AND FLOWERS CURLING IN DIVERS WAVY LINES
HENRI DALBRET II
ANAGNI WHERE BONIFACE VIII
THE SECOND WAS PAGOLO A ROMAN OF SUCH HUMBLE ORIGIN THAT HE DID NOW KNOW HIS OWN FATHER
MINUTES SEEMED YEARS TO ME TILL I HAD PUT MY THINGS IN ORDER WHICH I DID IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
I PERFORMED MY TASK IN THE SPACE OF SOME THREE HOURS AND GAVE IT A FINE AIR OF ELEGANCE
WHEN POPE CLEMENT HEARD WHAT I HAD DONE HE SENT AT ONCE TO CALL FOR ME AND INQUIRED INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCE
IF YOU WOULD FAIN BY WORTHY DEEDS BE KNOWN SEEK TO BE PRISONED WITHOUT CAUSE LIE LONG AND FIND NO FRIEND TO LISTEN TO YOUR MOAN
ALTOGETHER RECKONED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWELVE SWORDS
I WHO HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE MATTER GREETED HIM MOST KINDLY ACCORDING TO MY CUSTOM TO WHICH COURTESY HE REPLIED WITH INSULTS
THE WOMAN CONFESSES HER GUILT
THAT NIGHT WE OBTAINED NO ANSWER
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE ROSE ANGRILY FROM HIS SEAT AND SAID TO ME IN ITALIAN
3 HE WAS AN ENGINEER FROM SIENA AT THAT TIME IN DIEPPE WHICH IS RATHER MORE THAN A DAYS JOURNEY DISTANT FROM THE CAPITAL
I HAVE RETAINED CELLINIS SPELLING OF NAMES UPON THIS JOURNEY
BUT SINCE HE WORE HIS BEARD SHORT AFTER THE VENETIAN FASHION I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN MODELLING A HEAD TO MY OWN SATISFACTION
HE NEGOTIATED THE ELECTION OF THE DUKE OF ANJOU TO THE THRONE OF POLAND
NOTE 12
1 MY PARTNER HAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ASKED HIM FOR SOME MONEYS WHICH WERE DUE FOR CERTAIN LITTLE RINGS CONFIDED TO SER BENEDETTO
WHEN THEY WERE FINISHED WE TOOK THEM TO THE POPE
SO WHEN I FOUND IT OF THAT KIND AND QUALITY I FELT CERTAINLY DISINCLINED TO RECOMMEND ITS ACQUISITION
AT THAT TIME THIS WORTHY MAN WOULD GLADLY HAVE GRANTED ME MY LIBERTY BECAUSE HE FANCIED THAT THE GREAT WRONG DONE TO ME WAS A MAIN CAUSE OF HIS DEATH
WHILE RESUMING MY WORK AND PUSHING MY STATUE FORWARD I RACKED MY BRAINS TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE DUKES MANNER
CORNARO BADE HIM FOR THAT DAY MAKE AS THOUGH HE HAD ALREADY TALKED WITH ME
HOW MANY A TIME MY CHEEK MUST GROW BLANCHED BY THOSE LILIES
THEIR FATHER STUNG TO FURY BY THE SCOLDING OF THAT RESPECTABLE GENTLEMAN POURED OUT A VOLLEY OF ABUSIVE BLASPHEMIES AND LEVELLED HIS SPONTOON SWEARING HE WOULD MURDER ME
FRANCIOTTO ORSINI WAS EDUCATED IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF HIS KINSMAN LORENZO DE MEDICI
THE POOR POPE IN DESPAIR SEEING HIMSELF ASSASSINATED BOTH INSIDE THE CASTLE AND WITHOUT SAID THAT HE LEFT THEM TO ARRANGE IT
I ANSWERED THAT THE RING HIS EXCELLENCY HAD GIVEN ME WAS WORTH ABOUT TEN CROWNS AND THAT THE WORK I HAD DONE FOR HIM WAS WORTH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED
THE CARDINAL SENT ME WORD NOT TO EAT THE FOOD PROVIDED FOR ME BY THE POPE
ACCORDINGLY AFTER THIS DINNER HE SET OFF WITH MADAME DE TAMPES THE CARDINAL OF LORRAINE AND SOME OTHER OF HIS GREATEST NOBLES AMONG WHOM WERE THE KING OF NAVARRE HIS COUSIN AND THE QUEEN HIS SISTER
NOW YOUR METHOD OF WORKING AND YOUR DESIGNS ARE WORTHY RATHER OF A SCULPTOR THAN A GOLDSMITH
AND SO MAKING A GOOD CALCULATION I HIT MY MARK
MEANWHILE LET HIM LOOK TO HIS BEHAVIOUR AND FINISH MY COMMISSIONS. 2 THE FOLLOWING EVENING TWO HOURS AFTER SUNDOWN I MET MESSER BARTOLOMMEO VALORI 3 AT THE CORNER OF THE MINT
THE KING WAS VASTLY AMUSED BUT I FELT COVERED WITH CONFUSION
SO I BROUGHT HIM AWAY FROM THERE AND TAUGHT HIM MINUTELY HOW TO STRIKE COINS FROM THOSE DIES
HE THEN NOT HAVING THE SPIRIT TO LAY HANDS ON ME CRIED OUT
THIS CAUSED MONSIGNOR SALAMANCA TO REPENT THAT HE HAD HECTORED OVER ME
FOR ONE HOUR AND A HALF EACH DAY I GOT A LITTLE GLIMMERING OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THAT UNHAPPY CAVERN THROUGH A VERY NARROW APERTURE
I THOUGHT THAT WHILE HE WAS INSPECTING THE CHALICE I MIGHT TELL HIM OF MY PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENTS
ANNIBALE CARO WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WRITERS OF ITALIAN PROSE AND VERSE IN THE LATER RENAISSANCE
I NOTICED THAT HE CARRIED SWORD AND DAGGER AND WAS SITTING ON A BIG CHEST WITH HIS ARM ROUND CATERINAS NECK
ON THIS THE CARDINAL REPLIED
AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED THESE I TOOK THEM TO A CITY WHICH BELONGED TO THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE CART TURNED UP
SO THEN LEAVING HOME WITH MY FATHERS BLESSING I MOUNTED MY GOOD HORSE AND RODE OFF ON IT TO MANTUA
I TOOK THE PRECAUTION OF DISCHARGING MY ARTILLERY JUST BEFORE HE CAME IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE
LXXIX A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS WE SET OUT ON OUR RETURN TO FLORENCE
I THANKED HIS MAJESTY FOR FREEING ME FROM PRISON SAYING THAT ALL PRINCES UNIQUE FOR GENEROSITY UPON THIS EARTH AS WAS HIS MAJESTY LAY UNDER SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS TO SET FREE MEN OF TALENT AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WERE INNOCENT AS I WAS
1 AND I TOOK IT WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS DISCIPLINE AND RULES OF ABSTINENCE THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF
I RESUMED MY MARCH CRAWLING ALWAYS ON ALL FOURS AND MAKING FOR THE PALACE OF THE DUCHESS WIFE OF DUKE OTTAVIO AND DAUGHTER OF THE EMPEROR
BUT WHEN I REACHED THE MAN AND RAISED MY EYES I SAW HIM UNARMED RIDING A SORRY MULE OR RATHER DONKEY AND HE HAD WITH HIM A BOY OF TEN YEARS OLD
AND WHEN I PAID HIM MY RESPECTS I TOOK THE PIECE WITH ME
THE LOMBARDS FOR EXAMPLE CONSTRUCT VERY BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS BY COPYING THE LEAVES OF BRIONY AND IVY IN EXQUISITE CURVES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY AGREEABLE TO THE EYE
ON MY ARRIVAL THE POPE HAD MY COPE-BUTTON BROUGHT AND I IN THE MEANTIME DREW FORTH MY CHALICE
THE FIRST AND THE ONE I LIKED BEST WAS ASCANIO FROM TAGLIACOZZO IN THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES
SO I KEPT MY HAND UPON MY SWORD AND STOOD EYEING HIM ASKANCE
HEARING THIS I STOOD A WHILE ON GUARD AND MADE NO ANSWER BEING FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO ENGAGE MYSELF
THEN THEY SAID TO ME
HE WAS ATTENDED BY HIS MADAME DETAMPES HIS SON THE DAUPHIN AND THE DAUPHINéSS TOGETHER WITH THE KING OF NAVARRE HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW MADAME MARGUERITE HIS DAUGHTER 2 AND SEVERAL OTHER GREAT LORDS WHO HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY MADAME DETAMPES TO SPEAK AGAINST ME
ACCORDINGLY I TOOK UP A LITTLE KNIFE AND A FEW OF THOSE PARTICLES AND PLACED THEM ON AN IRON BAR OF MY PRISON
JUST ABOUT THAT TIME THE DEVILRIES OF WAR BETWEEN THE EMPEROR AND KING HAD BEEN STIRRED UP AGAIN SO THAT I FOUND HIM MUCH HARASSED BY ANXIETIES
UNLESS YOU MAKE IF FOR THE KING TO WHOM I MEAN TO TAKE YOU I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WILL MAKE IT FOR ANOTHER MAN ALIVE. THEN HE SHOWED ME LETTERS IN WHICH THE KING UNDER ONE HEADING BADE HIM RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BRINGING BENVENUTO WITH HIM
AND HAVING NO REPUTATION FOR CHASTITY SHE CONTRIVED TO CARESS THE LAD MORE PERHAPS THAN WAS QUITE SEEMLY WHICH MADE ME NOTICE THAT HE BEGAN TO VISIT HER MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HIS WONT HAD BEEN
AT TIMES THE POOR MAN DETAINED ME FOR FOUR OR FIVE STRICKEN HOURS WITHOUT EVER LETTING ME CEASE TALKING
CARDINAL CIBO SENT FOR ME AND AFTER SOME TIME SPENT IN AGREEABLE CONVERSATION GAVE ME THE ORDER FOR A LARGE VASE BIGGER THAN SALAMANCAS
WAS IT NOT YOUR DUTY TO INSPECT THE RECORD OF THE JEWELS WHICH HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY INSCRIBED BY THIS APOSTOLIC CAMERA THROUGH THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION WITH TRIBOLO HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD NO WORK TO GIVE HIM AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT HE MIGHT CALL AGAIN
THERE WERE HOWEVER PRESENT AT THE COMPETITION CERTAIN MILANESE GENTLEMEN OF THE FIRST CONSEQUENCE WHO SAID
I LIKE A YOUTH WITHOUT EXPERIENCE RETORTED ON MY POOR AFFLICTED PARENT
LOOK GRANDPAPA AT MY PRETTY LITTLE CRAB. WHEN HE RECOGNISED THAT THE CREATURE WAS A SCORPION HE WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING DEAD FOR THE GREAT FEAR HE HAD AND ANXIETY ABOUT ME
HE HOWEVER GREW MORE OBSTINATE IN HIS OFFICIOUSNESS AND WROTE ME ANOTHER LETTER SO EXTRAVAGANTLY WORDED THAT IF IT HAD BEEN SEEN I SHOULD HAVE GOT INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE
THE DUKE BOUGHT IT FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PITTI IN 1565
1 THE POISON WAS TO WORK SLOWLY PRODUCING ITS EFFECT AT THE END OF FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
BARTOLOMMEO OR BACCIO VALORI A DEVOTED ADHERENT OF THE MEDICI PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN FLORENTINE HISTORY
I HAD BEEN RECKONING THAT HIS EXCELLENCY WOULD TREAT ME WITH THE SAME KINDNESS OR EVEN GREATER AS BEFORE I LEFT FOR ROME
I MIND TO DO JUST THE OPPOSITE AND TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN SO MUCH THAT THEY SHALL BE ABLE TO SUCCOUR YOURS. TO THIS MY FATHER ANSWERED
ONLY PROMISE NOT TO KILL ME AND I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU COMMAND. THE NOTARIES AND WITNESSES ARRIVED
AND THESE MEN WOULD HAVE HAD ME SENT TO PRISON AND PUNISHED WITHOUT TOO CLOSE A RECKONING
ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHEN I HAD RUN AWAY FROM MY FATHER I WENT TO THIS GOOD MAN AND STAYED SOME TIME WITH HIM WORKING AT THE GOLDSMITHS TRADE UNTIL MY FATHER SENT FOR ME BACK
AND SOME GENTLEMEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAPPENED TO BE AT MY SHOP CALLED MY ATTENTION SAYING
FIASCHINO CAME AT ONCE TO SEE ME AND DECLARED WITH VEHEMENT EXPOSTULATIONS THAT THE DUKE WOULD TAKE IT VERY ILL IF I REFUSED A PRESENT HE HAD MEANT SO KINDLY
WHAT SHALL WE HEAR TO-MORROW WHICH THIS PORTENT HAS ANNOUNCED? I ANSWERED
IF YOUR HOLINESS WERE TO DEPRIVE BENVENUTO OF THE MINT PERHAPS HE WOULD TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO COMPLETE THE CHALICE. TO THIS THE POPE ANSWERED NO
DURING OUR INDISPOSITION WE WENT ABOUT INSPECTING THE DOMAIN
I EARNED IT BY THE TALENTS I DISPLAYED AND YOU ARE ROBBING ME OF IT MERELY BY YOUR IDLE TALKING. NOTE 1
XXI AT THE END OF A MONTH AND A HALF THE KING RETURNED TO PARIS
YOU SAY WELL AND HERE UPON THE SPOT I WILL MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT I MEAN HIM TO DO. THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN
I HAD NO ASSISTANTS EXCEPT SOME LITTLE SHOPBOYS AMONG WHOM WAS ONE OF GREAT BEAUTY
THERE DOST THOU GAZE ON HIS BEATITUDE WHO MADE OUR UNIVERSE AND FINDEST TRUE THE FORM OF HIM THY SKILL FOR MEN EXPRESSED. NOTE 1
AT THAT TIME BOLOGNA OF WHOM I HAVE ALREADY SAID SO MUCH HAD BROUGHT FROM ROME HIS STATUES AND HAD CAST THEM VERY CAREFULLY IN BRONZE
I HAD NOT POCKETED ONE PENNY OF THE MONEY NOR HAD I RECEIVED ANY REWARD FOR MY COMPLETED WORKS
UPON THE ROAD NOTICING THE MARBLE AS HE PASSED THE CARDINAL PRAISED IT HIGHLY INQUIRING OF HIS EXCELLENCY FOR WHAT SCULPTOR HE INTENDED IT
XCIV IN GODS NAME THEN I LEFT FLORENCE CONTINUALLY SINGING PSALMS AND PRAYERS IN HIS HONOUR UPON ALL THAT JOURNEY
DONT SHOW YOURSELF AGAIN UPON MY PREMISES. I REMINDED HIM OF THE MONEY HE OWED ME
THE STRENGTH OF HIS RAYS AS IS THEIR WONT FIRST MADE ME CLOSE MY EYES
ACCORDINGLY THE DEED WAS EXECUTED TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY WERE TO PAY ME A RENT OF SIXTY-FIVE CROWNS IN TWO HALF-YEARLY INSTALLMENTS DURING THE TERM OF MY NATURAL LIFE
ALAS ALAS
FROM THE FINE PHYSIOGNOMY AND BODILY SYMMETRY WHICH I OBSERVED IN THIS YOUNG MAN I PREDICT THAT HE WILL ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE SAYS AND THINK THAT HE WILL EVEN GO BEYOND IT. THE POPE PUT IN
SO THE MATTER WAS POSTPONED TILL ANOTHER OCCASION AND I SET OFF AGAIN AT ONCE FOR PARIS
THERE WAS ALSO NO REASON WHY I SHOULD VISIT THE PROPERTY BECAUSE SBIETTA ONLY SOLD IT TO ME FOR THE INCOME
HE MARRIED IN EARLY LIFE A DAUGHTER OF PIERO DE MEDICI
FOR THOUGH SEVERAL OF MY COMRADES WERE DEAD I SURVIVED IN HEALTH AND FREEDOM
I TOOK THE DIES IN HAND DESIGNING A S
CONSEQUENTLY ONE DAY AFTER DINNER HE HAD ME SENT FOR IN THE NAME OF SIGNOR PIER LUIGI
AND FOR THE REST BADE ME BE OF GOOD CHEER
YIELDING MYSELF UP TO BLIND RAGE I SEIZED HER BY THE HAIR AND DRAGGED HER UP AND DOWN MY ROOM BEATING AND KICKING HER TILL I WAS TIRED
THIS MAN WAS TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT RASCALLY GANG WHO HAD WISHED TO SEE ME HANGED
CROSSING THE SEINE I THEN TOOK A SMALL HAND-BASKET WHICH ONE OF MY COUSINS A NUN HAD GIVEN ME ON MY JOURNEY THROUGH FLORENCE
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN THAT I WENT TO MANTUA WHERE I WAS VERY KINDLY RECEIVED AND STAYED THERE SEVERAL YEARS
THEREUPON HE REPLIED
THEREAT THE POPE RAISING HIS HAND AND MAKING A LARGE OPEN SIGN OF THE CROSS UPON MY FACE TOLD ME THAT HE BLESSED ME AND THAT HE GAVE ME PARDON FOR ALL MURDERS I HAD EVER PERPETRATED OR SHOULD EVER PERPETRATE IN THE SERVICE OF THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH
ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS MADE ME DEVISE A PLEASANT TRICK FOR THE INCREASE OF MERRIMENT AND THE DIFFUSION OF MIRTH IN OUR SOCIETY
I TOLD THE CARDINAL THAT SINCE I WAS AWARE HIS MAJESTY HAD PUT ME UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP IF HE GAVE ME LEAVE I FELT READY TO DEPART AND PROMISED TO RETURN UPON THE SMALLEST HINT FROM HIS REVERENCE
GO UP THITHER BY THYSELF. QUITTING HIS SIDE I ASCENDED THE STAIRS BACKWARDS AND GRADUALLY BEGAN TO COME WITHIN THE REGION OF THE SUNLIGHT
THE HAIL NOW GREW TO THE SIZE OF BIG LEMONS
AFTER I HAD SENT MY LETTER THAT TRAITOR THE PERUGIAN WORKMAN DEVISED A PIECE OF MALICE AGAINST ME WHICH SUCCEEDED AT ONCE OWING TO THE AVARICE OF POPE PAOLO DA FARNESE BUT ALSO FAR MORE TO THAT OF HIS BASTARD WHO WAS THEN CALLED DUKE OF CASTRO
NOW THERE WAS AMONG THEM MY DEAREST COMRADE NAMED ALBERTACCIO DEL BENE OWN BROTHER TO ALESSANDRO AND ALBIZZO WHO IS NOW A VERY RICH MAN IN LYONS
PROPERLY LE MOINE BOURRU THE GHOST OF A MONK DRESSED IN DRUGGET BURE LE PETIT NESLE HAD A BAD REPUTATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE MURDERS SAID TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED THERE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY BY QUEEN JEANNE WIFE OF PHILIP V
HE HAD FOUR OTHER FELLOWS OF LIKE KIDNEY WITH HIM WHO CRIED OUT TO MAFFIO
YOU ARE TO KNOW MY LORDS THAT IT IS NOW SOME TWENTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST CAME TO ROME AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SENT TO PRISON HERE OR ELSEWHERE. ON THIS THAT CATCHPOLE OF A GOVERNOR CALLED OUT
THIS BEING MY FIRM PURPOSE I HAD NO INTENTION TO ASK LEAVE OF THE DUKE OR ANYBODY BUT TO DECAMP AS QUICKLY AS I COULD
WHAT WITH THE STONE THE IRON FRAME TO HOLD IT UP AND THE WAGES IT HAS COST ME ABOVE THREE HUNDRED CROWNS
LET ONE BE FAMED AS BAD AS MORTAL MAY SEND HIM IN JAIL TWO SORRY YEARS TO PINE HELL COME FORTH HOLY WISE BELOVED ALWAY HERE SOUL FLESH CLOTHES THEIR SUBSTANCE GROSS REFINE
THE GOOD KING GUESSING WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BUSINESS MADE NO ANSWER
3 DIVIDE THESE SO THAT HE MAY TAKE HIS SHARE. WHEN GIANGIACOMO LEFT THE POPE HE CAME TO US AND RELATED IN DETAIL ALL THAT THE POPE HAD SAID
MESSER GABRIELLO CESANO ALSO SPOKE EXCEEDINGLY WELL TO THE SAME PURPOSE
HE HAD BEEN INVESTED WITH THE DUCHY OF CASTRO IN 1537
HAPPENING TO LOOK INTO THE FIRE HE SPIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE MOST BURNING FLAMES A LITTLE CREATURE LIKE A LIZARD WHICH WAS SPORTING IN THE CORE OF THE INTENSEST COALS
SEND THE GOVERNOR TO HIM TO FIND OUT WHO HELPED HIM TO ESCAPE
XIII THE AFFRONTS AND INSULTS I RECEIVED MADE ME HAVE RECOURSE TO THE KING BEGGING HIS MAJESTY TO ESTABLISH ME IN SOME OTHER PLACE
TO BEGIN THEN
THE CHAMBERLAINS TWITCHED ME BY THE MANTLE AND SENT ME AFTER
I PASSED A HAPPY DAY PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE DUKES MESSAGE AND ALSO BECAUSE THE FOLK KEPT POINTING ME OUT AS SOMETHING MARVELLOUS AND STRANGE
I TELL YOU THEREFORE PLAINLY
AND INDEED THEY WERE MORE LIKE TO HAVE EXCOMMUNICATED ME SINCE I COULD WITH DIFFICULTY COME TO MYSELF AGAIN THE EARTH DOING ME MORE MISCHIEF THAN THE BLOW
AND ALBEIT THE PROMISED REWARD HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN ME MY ONE ANXIETY IS TO REMAIN IN HIS MAJESTYS OPINION THAT MAN OF PROBITY AND HONOUR WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
IT HAPPENED ON THE EVENING OF A CERTAIN FEAST-DAY THAT THE CASTELLAN WAS SERIOUSLY INDISPOSED
THE TORRE DI NONA WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PRISONS IN ROME USED ESPECIALLY FOR CRIMINALS CONDEMNED TO DEATH
HE ACTED FOR MANY YEARS AS SPANISH VICEROY OF MILAN
HE SUPPLIED HER WITH PERFUMED WATERS WHICH WERE EXCELLENT FOR THE COMPLEXION AND HITHERTO UNKNOWN IN FRANCE
THEY TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT HE HAD SPOKEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN MY PRAISE
YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN AS VIRTUOUS GOOD AND WORTHY A MAN AS WAS EVER BORN AND YOU HAVE NOT DEGENERATED FROM HIM
THIS MAN WAS A MEMBER OF A VERY NOBLE FLORENTINE FAMILY
AS GOD WILLED THE DUKE AND THE DUCHESS HEARD ABOUT IT
THE COURT WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS EXCELLENT ORCHESTRA AND THEATRICAL DISPLAY OF ALL KINDS
AFTER SCALING THE ROOF I TOOK ONE END OF MY LINEN ROLL AND ATTACHED IT TO A PIECE OF ANTIQUE TILE WHICH WAS BUILT INTO THE FORTRESS WALL
I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THAT I ENTERED THE SERVICE OF HIS MAJESTY IN THE YEAR 1540 WHICH WAS EXACTLY THE YEAR IN WHICH I REACHED THE AGE OF FORTY
THE POPE WHO HAD HEARD THE WHOLE HISTORY AND I MUST ADD THAT THE DOCTORS HAD ALREADY GIVEN THE CASTELLAN OVER SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
ALSO THAT MY ART ITSELF WOULD SUFFER AND NOT ATTAIN THE MARK I AIMED AT FOR HIS MAJESTY
I SHALL BE SURE TO CATCH HIM. HE HAD PASSED SEVERAL NIGHTS IN THIS FRENZY AND HAD WORN OUT ALL HIS SERVANTS WHEREOF I RECEIVED FULL INFORMATION THROUGH DIVERS CHANNELS BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THE SAVOYARD WHO WAS MY FRIEND AT HEART
LOOK HERE
THE POPE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SEE IT AND THAT IF HE THEN FOUND ME UNFIT FOR THE PURPOSE HE SHOULD LOOK AROUND FOR ONE WHO WAS FIT
HE TOLD ME THAT IF I WISHED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT PERIL I HAD BETTER GO WITH HIM OTHERWISE I RAN SOME RISK OF MY LIFE
112 ANDANDO A TRIBOLARE LA VITA TUA NOTE 2
SEEING WHICH I TOOK ONE OF THE MATCHES AND GOT THE ASSISTANCE OF A FEW MEN WHO WERE NOT OVERCOME BY THEIR EMOTIONS
IT IS ALL THE SAME TO THIS FELLOW WHETHER HE LIVES OR DIES AND BEHOLD HE IS MORE FIERY THAN WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH
HE SPENT THE LATTER PORTION OF HIS LIFE IN THE SERVICE OF THE FARNESI
AND EACH THOUGHT THAT HE HAD VERY WELL ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS
HIS HOLINESS REMARKED
IT SO CHANCED THAT I HAD BEEN UPON THE SPOT ALONE AND WITHOUT ARMS
BROTHER I DO NOT WISH TO STAY HERE LONGER FOR THESE FELLOWS WILL END BY MAKING ME DO SOMETHING TREMENDOUS WHICH MAY CAUSE THEM TO REPENT OF THE ANNOYANCE THEY HAVE GIVEN ME. THEN HE KICKED OUT BOTH HIS LEGS-THE INJURED LIMB WE HAD ENCLOSED IN A VERY HEAVY BOX-AND MADE AS THOUGH HE WOULD FLING IT ACROSS A HORSES BACK
BY THIS TIME A CROWD HAD GATHERED ROUND TO HEAR THE QUARREL
XIV
AND THAT EVENING AT THE FIRST LODGING WE CAME TO SETTLED OUR ACCOUNTS TOGETHER
SOME TIME OR OTHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BESTOW ON BENVENUTO A GOOD THING PERHAPS MORE SUITABLE TO HIM THAN THIS WOULD BE. THEN THE POPE TURNING TO MESSER BARTOLOMMEO VALORI TOLD HIM
FOR MESSER DURANTE SEE ABOVE P
THE KING LAUGHED AT THE MATTER AND MADE ME OUT NEW LETTERS-PATENT TO SECURE ME FROM FURTHER MOLESTATION
GOD PERHAPS HAD HEARD THE PRAYERS THEY KEPT CONTINUALLY MAKING AND MEANT TO RID THEM IN THIS MANNER OF THOSE IMPIOUS SCOUNDRELS
SO NOW WHEN HE RECEIVED ME WITH SUCH RUDENESS
AND THEN HE PRAYED ME FOR GODS LOVE USING THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOW WITH TEARS IN THE TONE OF HIS VOICE
AND HE SAYS THAT IF YOU DO NOT OPEN AT ONCE HE WILL KNOCK THE DOOR DOWN
THE KNAVE WHO SERVES HATH ORDERS STRICT AND COOL TO LIST NO WORD YOU UTTER GIVE YOU NAUGHT SCARCELY TO OPE THE DOOR
SO THEN, HE SAID THOU HAST CONTEMPT FOR HIS HANDIWORK THROUGH THIS THY WILL TO SPOIL IT
AND THE POPE PRAISED ME IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AMONG WHOM WAS THE FELLOW LATINO JUVENALE WHOM I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
THE BOOK IS ACCEPTABLE TO ME AND SO ARE YOU
GO MY BENVENUTO
HAVING TAKEN THEM SEVERAL TIMES TO THE PLACE HIS EXCELLENCY SENT WORD BY MESSER CESARE THE KEEPER OF HIS WARDROBE THAT I SHOULD LEAVE THEM THERE
HAD IT BEEN FINISHED I SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE FACT A THOUGHT
AT THE VERY LEAST WHEN THIS ITALIAN HEARS WHAT YOU ARE AFTER HE WILL PAY DOWN SEVERAL HUNDRED DUCATS KNOWING HOW GREAT THE DANGER IS AND HOW HEAVILY THAT OFFENCE IS PUNISHED IN FRANCE. UPON THIS THEY WERE AGREED
THIS LUCA BY HIS OWN VALOUR WITH SWORD IN HAND OVERCAME AND SLEW HIM WITH SUCH BRAVERY AND STOUTNESS THAT HE MOVED THE FOLK TO WONDER WHO WERE EXPECTING QUITE THE CONTRARY ISSUE
AT THE SAME TIME THE CASTELLAN MOST CERTAINLY DID HIS UTMOST TO ASSIST ME
BUT ONLY I WAS PUNISHED BY HAVING TO PAY THE FOUR MEASURES OF MEAL
I HAD CONFIDED WHAT I WAS DOING ABOUT THEM TO HIM ALONE BEGGING HIM TO KEEP MY SECRET
HE DUCKED HIS HEAD SO THAT THE MUD HIT HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SKULL
BUT THE DUKES ATTENTIVE CHAMBERLAIN ARRANGED WITH MESSER ALBERTO THAT I SHOULD GET NO HORSES THEN
BENVENUTO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO ROME LEAVE ME A SUM OF FIFTEEN DUCATS TO PAY FOR MY LYING-IN AND THEN I WILL TRAVEL AFTER YOU. I TOLD THE OLD HARRIDAN THAT I WOULD VERY GLADLY LEAVE HER THIRTY IF SHE WOULD GIVE ME MY ANGELICA
DURING MANY MONTHS I HAVE HEARD NOTHING TO THE CONTRARY
CVII THE CASTELLAN WAS SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN SICKNESS WHICH CAME UPON HIM EVERY YEAR AND DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WITS
ONOFRIO PANVINIO TELLS THIS STORY OF PAUL III.S IMPRISONMENT AND ESCAPE BUT PLACES IT IN THE PAPACY OF INNOCENT VIII
I STOOD UPON MY GUARD AGAINST THEM
FOR I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN PLEASURE IN KEEPING FINE WEAPONS
SOME REVOLUTION MUST CERTAINLY HAVE OCCURRED IN FLORENCE. SO WE SUPPED AGREEABLY
AS SOON AS HE ESCAPED MY CLUTCHES HE RAN AWAY WITHOUT CAPE OR CAP AND FOR TWO DAYS I DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS AND TOOK NO CARE TO FIND HIM
ONE WOULD THINK YOU HAD NO EYES
BY THIS LITTLE JOB I EARNED A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY
THE ALPI ARE HIGH MOUNTAIN PASTURES IN THE APENNINES
HAVING REACHED ROME I GOT MYSELF AT ONCE IN READINESS TO WORK AND WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND AGAIN A SILVER BASIN WHICH I HAD BEGUN FOR THE CARDINAL BEFORE I WAS IMPRISONED
WHEN BANDINELLO BECAME AWARE OF THIS HE SET TO WORK WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AT THE COMPLETION OF HIS PIETà AND PRAYED THE DUCHESS TO GET FOR HIM THE CHAPEL OF THE PAZZI FOR HIS MONUMENT
O MY FATHER I HAVE SOUGHT AND LOVED THAT GIRL AND NOT THEIR MONEY
THEREUPON MY BLOOD WAS UP AND I CRIED
E HAD DIED OF THE PLAGUE
NOT ONLY WAS THE STYLE OF THIS HEAD EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL BUT NATURE HAD HERE FAR SURPASSED ART
CV THIS MAN HAD BEEN ARRESTED AS A LUTHERAN
BUT BECAUSE MATTIO WENT ON LAUGHING THE JOKE TURNED TO EARNEST FOR MESSER GIOVANNI WOULD NOT LOOK UPON HIM AGAIN BUT SENT FOR MESSER ANTONIO ALLEGRETTI MESSER LUDOVICO AND MESSER ANNIBAL CARO
TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THESE WORDS I NEED ONLY REMIND YOUR EXCELLENCY OF DONATELLO AND THE GREAT LIONARDO DA VINCI IN THE PAST AND OF OUR INCOMPARABLE MICHEL ANGELO BUONARROTI IN THE PRESENT
AND I TELL YOU THAT I DO NOT MEAN TO DELAY BEYOND TO-MORROW. ON HEARING THIS MOST WELCOME ASSURANCE I TURNED ALL THE FORCES OF MY SOUL AND BODY TO GOD FERVENTLY OFFERING UP THANKS TO HIM
AND WITH THIS MANIFESTATION OF SUBMISSIVENESS I EMPLOYED EVERY LIKELY MEANS OF PACIFYING HIS RESENTMENT
MANY UNTOWARD THINGS CAN I REMEMBER SUCH AS HAPPEN TO ALL WHO LIVE UPON OUR EARTH
MOREOVER IF HE SHOULD LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS ADMINISTER THESE FIVE REMEDIES ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND SEND FOR ME FOR I WILL COME AT ANY HOUR OF THE NIGHT
IPPOLITO THE CARDINAL WAS THE BASTARD OF GIULIANO DUKE OF NEMOURS SON OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
MASTER PARDON ME
SO I COULD NOT ADMIT THAT I DESERVED DEATH ACCORDING TO THE DISPENSATION UNDER WHICH MAN DWELLS HERE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THE FORM OF DRINKING TOGETHER AND EXCHANGING KISSES
HIS RECITATIONS WERE SO ADMIRABLE THAT THE DIVINE MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI THAT PRINCE OF SCULPTORS AND OF PAINTERS WENT WHEREVER HE HEARD THAT HE WOULD BE WITH THE GREATEST EAGERNESS AND DELIGHT TO LISTEN TO HIM
I RELATED ALL I HAD BEEN DOING
IT WAS I WHO UNREWARDED FOR THIS ACT BETOOK MYSELF WITH VIGOUR TO THE GUNS WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY THE CANNONEERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE ORDNANCE
MY LORD WHAT I TOLD YOU IS THE TRUTH
YOU CANNOT GO WRONG
I WAS SO ABSORBED AND ENAMOURED BY MY WORK THAT I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT ANGELICA OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND BUT GAVE MY WHOLE SELF UP TO IT
TO THE FORMER I CONFIDED THE PRECIOUS STONES TO KEEP IN SAFETY
BUT I PROMISE YOU WELL THAT YOU HAVE STIRRED A SNAKE UP WHICH WILL STING YOU AND SERVE YOU RIGHT! THEN HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO CARDINAL DE MEDICI AND COMMISSIONED HIM TO LOOK AFTER ME ADDING THAT HE SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LET ME SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS
ON MY RETURN THE SURGEON USED IT AND BEGAN TO WORK WITH SO GENTLE A HAND THAT SHE FELT NO PAIN AND IN A SHORT WHILE THE OPERATION WAS OVER
WHILE I WAS WORKING AT THIS PIECE MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI CAME OFTENTIMES TO SEE IT
THE MAN HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN THE LIGHT CAVALRY BUT AFTERWARDS HAD JOINED THE ARQUEBUSIERS AS ONE OF THE BARGELLOS CORPORALS
I HAVE KEPT HIM IN PRISON AT THE REQUEST OF SOME OF MY PEOPLE SINCE HE IS A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT IN HIS BEHAVIOUR
AFTER I HAD SLEPT ABOUT AN HOUR FELICE CAME HOME AND ASKED THE BOY HOW I WAS GETTING ON
THIS MESSAGE SO IRRITATED THE POPE THAT HE MADE HIS MIND UP TO KEEP ME A PRISONER FOR LIFE
THUS AT LENGTH WE REACHED OUR LODGING IN THE WILDERNESS
WHILE TRAVELLING I MET A SCULPTOR OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO WAS GOING TO SAN GERMANO TO FINISH THE TOMB OF PIERO DE MEDICI AT MONTE CASSINO
PHE PHE SATAN PHE PHE ALé PHE 1 NOW I HAD LEARNED THE FRENCH TONGUE WELL
I CLIP THE FOLK WHO HARM THEE WITH THESE SHEARS! THAT WORTHY ONE THEN ON MY BROW WROTE WIDE WITH PETERS PEN WORDS WHICH-FOR HE BADE SHUN TO SPEAK THEM THRICE-WITHIN MY BREAST I HIDE
ACCORDINGLY THIS FELLOW ON THE EVENING AFTER I HAD BROUGHT THE MEDAL AT ONE HOUR PAST NIGHTFALL HANDED ME A RING WITH A DIAMOND OF SHOWY APPEARANCE AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS ON THE PART OF HIS MASTER
AND WITHOUT REQUESTING MY ATTENDANCE CARRIED AND PRESENTED THEM TO THE KING
THESE THINGS ARE NEAR SANTA CROCE
THE KING TOOK THIS VERY ILL FOR HE HAD REQUESTED THE CARDINAL TO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT
XXXIII NOW MESSER GIOVANNI BOUGHT HIS FAVOURITE A VERY FINE BLACK HORSE FOR WHICH HE PAID 150 CROWNS
AT THE END OF THE YEAR MY MASTER ULIVIERI HAD OCCASION TO GO TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SELL CERTAIN GOLD AND SILVER SWEEPINGS WHICH HE HAD
3 THIS GENTLEMAN I REMOVED FROM HIS HOTEL AND TOOK HIM TO MY CASTLE ASSIGNING HIM IN LIKE MANNER HIS OWN SUITE OF APARTMENTS WHERE HE SOJOURNED MANY MONTHS WITH SERVING-MEN AND HORSES
HAVE NO FEAR BUT OPEN! THE BARGELLO VITTORIO AND THE OFFICERS SPRANG INSIDE AT ONCE THINKING THEY COULD EASILY LAY HANDS UPON ME
I WHO HAD TAKEN HIS PERSISTENCE IN THE MATTER STILL MORE ILL MADE NO REPLY BUT SWALLOWED DOWN MY IRRITATION
PIERO STROZZI WAS AT THIS TIME IN VALDICHIANA
THEN I WENT TO POGGIO A CAIANO WHERE THE DUKE AND DUCHESS WERE STAYING WITH THEIR SON THE PRINCE
ACCORDINGLY HE CALLED HIS CLERK AND WHILE THE SAFE-CONDUCT AS BEING READ HE SHOWED BY SIGNS TWO OR THREE TIMES THAT HE MEANT TO HAVE ME SECURED BY HIS OFFICERS
WHEN YOU TOOK ME BACK I SAID I WISHED TO REMAIN WITH YOU MY LIFETIME AND SO I HAVE IT IN MY MIND TO DO. I TOLD HIM THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME CONSENT
BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE SAME GOOD STYLE THEY RECOGNISED IN PERSEUS AND YET THEY HAD HEAPED RICHES ON THE MAN
FIRENZE LE MONNIER 1853
THEREFORE I WOULD RATHER NOT INSPECT ANY OBJECTS OF THE KIND FOR FEAR OF SPOILING THE UNIQUE IMPRESSION I RETAIN OF THAT
AND SO AFTER THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS HE CAME IN THE MISERABLE PLIGHT WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN TO ME AGAIN IN ROME BESEECHING ME FOR GODS SAKE TO HELP HIM
THE ORDER HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR ONE HOUR AFTER SUNSET
3 NOTE 1
3 NOTE 1
3 NOTE 1
3 NOTE 1
3 NOTE 1
TO YOU I HAVE TURNED PRECISELY WHAT BELONGS TO YOU
THE DUKE BIDS ME TELL YOU THAT IF YOU WANT YOUR DISMISSAL HE WILL GRANT IT
AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS I RETURNED TO FLORENCE WHERE THAT FELLOW PIERINO WHO HAD BEEN MY FATHERS PUPIL WAS GREATLY MORTIFIED BY MY RETURN
I FOLLOWED AFTER AND IN FOUR STEPS CAUGHT HIM UP WHEN I LIFTED MY DAGGER ABOVE HIS HEAD WHICH HE WAS HOLDING VERY LOW AND HIT HIM IN THE BACK EXACTLY AT THE JUNCTURE OF THE NAPE-BONE AND THE NECK
COME BROTHER I WILL TAKE YOU WHERE IM SURE YOUD NEVER GUESS
IF YOU COULD ONLY EXECUTE THIS LITTLE MODEL BENVENUTO WITH THE SAME PERFECTION ON A LARGE SCALE IT WOULD BE THE FINEST PIECE IN THE PIAZZA. I REPLIED
EQUALLY ENRAGED ON MY SIDE I ANSWERED THAT EVERY BIRD SANG ITS OWN NOTE
HIS ENTREATIES AND ARGUMENTS PERSUADED ME TO TAKE HIM ON THE JOURNEY IN THE MANNER HE PROPOSED
WHEN I REACHED THE AGE OF FIFTEEN I PUT MYSELF AGAINST MY FATHERS WILL TO THE GOLDSMITHS TRADE WITH A MAN CALLED ANTONIO SON OF SANDRO KNOWN COMMONLY AS MARCONE THE GOLDSMITH
I WENT UPSTAIRS TOOK OUT A LITTLE KNIFE AS SHARP AS A RAZOR AND CUT THE FOUR BEDS THAT I FOUND THERE INTO RIBBONS
ON REACHING THE GATE I FELT PITY FOR MY COMRADE AND WAITED FOR HIM AND TOOK HIM ON THE CRUPPER SAYING
SPENT A LARGE PART OF HIS LIFE IN FRANCE
BY THE NEXT I WISHED TO PERSONIFY THE WHOLE ART OF DESIGN INCLUDING SCULPTURE PAINTING AND ARCHITECTURE
IT WAS A WARM AND PLEASANT SEASON
THESE TROOPS ENTERED ROME IN OCTOBER 1526
3 HE WAS IN HIS ROOM ENGAGED IN STUDIES
AS SOON AS I KNEW THIS I COMPLAINED TO SIGNOR DON FRANCESCO THE DUKES SON WHO WAS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARD ME AND TOLD HIM HOW THEY HAD DISCLOSED MY STILL IMPERFECT STATUE
THE TWO MEN CAME UPON A COMMON UNDERSTANDING TO HIM AND SAID
THIS PECCI PASSED INTO THE SERVICE OF CATERINA DE MEDICI
BUT IT CLEARLY MEANS MEN ARMED WITH LANCES AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SIGNORY
HE WAS MOREOVER SO FAIR A PERSON THAT EVERY ONE WHO ONCE SET EYES ON HIM SEEMED BOUND TO LOVE HIM BEYOND MEASURE
AMONG THE MANY WHO DID SO WERE TWO GENTLEMEN DEPUTED BY THE VICEROY OF SICILY 2 TO OUR DUKE ON PUBLIC BUSINESS
ONE OF THEM IN THE MIDDLE WAS IN FULL RELIEF THE OTHER TWO IN HALF-RELIEF
AND THE DIAMOND BEING SOMEWHAT THIN THE JOB OF SETTING IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT GREAT DELIBERATION
I TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT IF I EVER HEAR THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN ONE SINGLE WORD ABOUT THIS WORK OF MINE I WILL KILL YOU LIKE A DOG
WELL THEN THIS FELLOW BROKE INTO THE SHOP WHERE HE FOUND A QUANTITY OF LITTLE THINGS IN GOLD AND SILVER
ON THE OTHER I BUILT BUT CASTLES IN THE AIR
NOW SINCE THE MEDAL WAS EXECUTED WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL THE VALUERS OF THE TRADE SET A FAR HIGHER PRICE ON IT THAN HE HAD THOUGHT OF
THEY REPRESENTED THE TAKING OF PISA BY THE FLORENTINES
I BEGAN AT ONCE TO SHOUT ALOUD
I COVERED THE BASKET WITH MY CAPE DREW MY SWORD AND SEEING THAT THEY WERE PUSHING HOTLY FORWARD CRIED ALOUD
HE ASKED ABOUT THE MODEL I HAD MADE FOR MY STATUE
TAKE FLOWER-DE-LUCES STALK BLOSSOM ROOT TOGETHER
XXV I HAD A TENNIS-COURT IN MY CASTLE FROM WHICH I DREW CONSIDERABLE PROFIT
I ORDERED THE FERRARESE WORKMAN CHIOCCIA TO COME WITH ME AND MADE A SERVANT FOLLOW WITH MY HORSE
HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD DO WHAT HE THOUGHT FIT AND THAT I HAD PERFORMED MY PART OF THE BUSINESS
TASSO WAS AN ABLE ARTIST MENTIONED BOTH BY VASARI AND PIETRO ARETINO
OH WHAT A FATE IS THIS OF MINE WHICH FORCES ME TO TAKE THIS JOURNEY
AND MY ANSWER WAS BECAUSE THE MARVELLOUS FRAMEWORK OF HIS BODY WAS SPOILED AND DEAD
TO-MORROW I SHALL GIVE YOU MONEY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR YOUR JOURNEY HOME
IT IS CALLED ARGENTANA AND IS DISTANT SEVERAL DAYS JOURNEY FROM PARIS
LXVII ABOUT THIS TIME A YOUNG FELLOW CALLED FRANCESCO THE SON OF A SMITH MATTEO LEFT BANDINELLOS EMPLOYMENT AND INQUIRED WHETHER I WOULD GIVE HIM WORK
AND ALTHOUGH THE MAJORDOMO HAD INFORMED THEM OF THE WHOLE PROCEEDINGS THEIR EXCELLENCIES DEEMED MY PERFORMANCE FAR MORE STUPENDOUS AND ASTONISHING WHEN THEY HEARD THE TALE FROM MY OWN MOUTH
NOW TO RETURN TO WHAT I CAUSED TO BE ENGRAVED UPON MY BROTHERS TOMB
1 HE WAS FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND A PERSON OF EXCESSIVE AFFECTATION
BUT HE SAID NO MORE THAN THIS
ONE DAY ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS I MOUNTED A NICE NAG I HAD PUT A HUNDRED CROWNS IN MY PURSE AND WENT TO FIESOLE TO VISIT A NATURAL SON OF MINE THERE WHO WAS AT NURSE WITH MY GOSSIP THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY WORKPEOPLE
LIONS FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HAD ALWAYS BEEN KEPT IN PART OF THE PALAZZO VECCHIO
AWARE WHAT MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE HE BEGGED THE BUTLER WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE BISHOPS PLATE TO TAKE IT TO THE MASTER WHO HAD MADE IT FOR HIM TO MEND AND PROMISED TO PAY WHAT PRICE HE ASKED PROVIDED IT WAS SET TO RIGHTS AT ONCE
I WAS TERRIFIED AND WANTED TO RETIRE
FOR PRECISELY WHEN I CAME UP TO THE CORNER HE WAS LEAVING THE SHOP AND HIS BRAVI HAD OPENED THEIR RANKS AND RECEIVED HIM IN THEIR MIDST
WHEN I REACHED IT I FOUND IT SHUT
BUT AFTER THEY HAD GONE TO BED I STOLE AWAY THE LITTLE SERVING-GIRL WHO WAS QUITE A FRESH MAID AND WOE TO HER IF HER MISTRESS HAD KNOWN OF IT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE NO CAUSE NOW TO TALK ABOUT HIM
I DEVOTED MUCH STUDY AND ATTENTION TO THIS WORK AND IT WON ME THE GREATEST HONOUR
IF HE TREATED ME TO LANGUAGE WITH WHICH MY EARS WERE UNFAMILIAR I WOULD NOT GO AT ALL
MY BROTHER HAD ACQUIRED THE RUDIMENTS OF LATIN BUT WAS STILL SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT YET RELISH THE TASTE OF VIRTUOUS EMPLOYMENT BUT PASSED HIS TIME IN DISSIPATION NOTE 1
MAY THE PLAGUE CATCH YOU AND ALL WHO DARE TO THINK I SHALL NOT FINISH IT! SO I WENT HOME WITH DESPAIR AT HEART TO MY UNLUCKY PERSEUS NOT WITHOUT WEEPING WHEN I REMEMBERED THE PROSPERITY I HAD ABANDONED IN PARIS UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THAT MARVELLOUS KING FRANCIS WHERE I HAD ABUNDANCE OF ALL KINDS AND HERE HAD EVERYTHING TO WANT FOR
THE ANNOYANCES ARISING FROM THAT LAWSUIT BEING AS I JUDGED NOW SETTLED DOWN
HE WAS OF A NOBLE VENETIAN HOUSE
YOU SEE THE ENEMIES ARE MOUNTING AND OUR MEN ARE IN FLIGHT. ALESSANDRO IN A PANIC CRIED
THE POPE WHO WAS AN EXCELLENT CONNOISSEUR OBSERVING THIS MISTAKE APPROVED OF NONE OF THEM
I HAVE TRANSLATED THE WORD BRIGATA BY FAMILY ABOVE BECAUSE I FIND CELLINI IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS ALLUDING TO HIS FAMILY AS LA MIA BRIGATINA NOTE 7
I AM DELIGHTED THAT BENVENUTO HAS HAD THIS TRIFLING SATISFACTION WHICH WILL SPUR HIM ON TO THE DESIRED CONCLUSION WITH MORE SPEED AND DILIGENCE
ONLY I FELT VERY GLAD TO UNDERGO THIS LABOUR HOPING TO MAKE THE DUCHESS WHO WAS AFTER ALL A PERSON OF INTELLIGENCE AS INDEED I HAD THE MEANS OF OBSERVING AT A LATER PERIOD REPENT OF HAVING DONE SO GREAT A WRONG BOTH TO THE MARBLE AND HERSELF
AND I FELT AS THOUGH OF A TRUTH I WERE IN PARADISE THE WHOLE YEAR I STAYED AT PISA WHERE I NEVER PLAYED THE FLUTE
FOR WHILE I WAS MAKING THE BASIN I THOUGHT THERE OUGHT TO BE A SALTCELLAR TO MATCH IT
MARK SIRS THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS POOR YOUNG MAN WHO HAS ACCUSED HIMSELF OF HAVING GIVEN A BOX ON THE EAR UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN A BLOW
DO YOU THEN TAKE ME FOR A MADMAN? I REJOINED
THIS AUGMENTED MY FEAR FOR I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE FALLING INTO AN AMBUSCADE WHICH WOULD HAVE CUT ME OFF IN FRONT AS WELL AS REAR
BUT FOR I FIND AT EVERY COIGN OBSCURE BASE LILIES WHICH SPREAD HOOKS WHERE FLOWERS SHOULD BLOW NEEDS MUST I FEAR LEST THESE TO RUIN LURE
SUPPLY ME WITH THE AID I NEED
SO I WENT ON TALKING ABOUT MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI
SEE BIANCHI P
SEE BIANCHI P
SEE BIANCHI P
I WENT UP TO THE ANGEL WHERE I HAD MY LODGING AND COULD LOCK THE DOOR SO AS TO BE FREE FROM INTERRUPTION
HE PLEASANTLY ADDED
LVIII IN MY ANXIETY THAT NOTHING SHOULD GO WRONG I SENT FOR TWO HAND-LABOURERS TO CLEAR MY GARDEN OF RUBBISH
THE ITALIAN FOR STRAPS COREGGE HAS A DOUBLE MEANING UPON WHICH CELLINI PLAYS
THE GALLERY AT BOLOGNA HAS A FINE SPECIMEN OF HIS PAINTING
YES, HE SAID IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOUSE WHICH BELONGS TO YOU
TRIBOLO WHO WAS THE MOST TIMOROUS MAN THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN KEPT ON SAYING
FELICE WHO THOUGHT HE HAD DONE WONDERS IN RESTORING ME NEVER LEFT MY SIDE
COME AND COMPARE THE PRICE OF YOUR JEWEL WITH THE PRICE OF MY PLATE. I SAID THAT HE MUST LEAVE THINGS AS THEY WERE TILL THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE I HOPED THAT EVEN AS MY WORK IN ITS KIND WAS NOT LESS EXCELLENT THAN HIS SO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW HIM QUITE AN EQUAL PRICE FOR IT
BUT AN OPPORTUNITY OF MENTIONING MY DAUGHTER HAVING ARISEN I AVAILED MYSELF OF IT SO AS NOT TO INTERRUPT THE NARRATIVE OF MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
I OUGHT TO ADD THAT I HAD TOLD CHIOCCIA NOT TO LET THE GIRL OR HER MOTHER LEAVE THE HOUSE SINCE I MEANT TO DEAL WITH THOSE TROLLOPS AFTER I HAD DISPOSED OF THEIR BULLY
SO I TURNED TO VINCENZIO ROMOLI AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE THE FUMIGATION AT ONCE
AND WE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED DURING OUR YOUTH IN ROME AND FLORENCE
SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND CALLED OUT TO FELICE TO DRIVE AWAY THE OLD MAN ON THE MOMENT WHO KEPT TORMENTING ME
WHEN I APPEARED AGAIN BEFORE THE KING AND UNCOVERED MY PIECE HE CRIED OUT IN ASTONISHMENT
I TOLD HIM TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD FOR I SHOULD DO HIM NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED I CRIED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE
AND AFTER THIS SAN GALLO USED HIS INFLUENCE SO STRENUOUSLY AGAINST HIM THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE VERGE OF STARVATION HAD NOT I PITIED HIS CONDITION AND LENT HIM SOME SCORES OF CROWNS TO LIVE UPON
OF A SURETY THESE ARE TOO GREAT EXPLOITS FOR ONE MAN ALONE
THIS DISTRICT OF THE CENTRAL APENNINES WAS ALWAYS FAMOUS FOR WITCHES POISONERS AND SO FORTH
DONT YOU SEE ALL THOSE FINE BRONZES FROM THE ANTIQUE BEHIND THERE
JUST AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE BEGAN TO SING AGAIN AND MADE SIGNS TO ME TO FOLLOW
THESE WORDS AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNED HAD BEEN PUT INTO VASARIS LIPS BY THAT EXCELLENT FELLOW 3 OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI WHO WANTED TO REVENGE HIMSELF FOR THE DUKES IRRITATION AGAINST HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE COINAGE AND MY DEPARTURE FROM FLORENCE
HAVING NOW FASTED TWO FULL HOURS BEYOND MY USUAL HOUR FOR SUPPING I FELL TO WITH HEARTY APPETITE
THIS MADE HIM INVITE ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND I AGREED
BUT I STOPPED THEM CRYING OUT
I WOULD TO GOD THAT OUR CITY HAD PLENTY OF THIS SORT INSTEAD OF THE PRESENT DEARTH OF THEM. NOTE 1
OH HEAVENS
THERE IS ONE MOST IMPORTANT MATTER BENVENUTO WHICH MEN OF YOUR SORT THOUGH FULL OF TALENT OUGHT ALWAYS TO BEAR IN MIND
SO I PASSED MY PAROLE AND HE GRANTED ME CONVENIENCES FOR WORKING AT MY TRADE
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
THEREUPON I FELL AGAIN UPON MY KNEES AND THANKED HIM FOR THE SAFE-CONDUCT HE HAD GIVEN ME SAYING AT THE SAME TIME THAT I SHOULD GO BACK WITH IT TO SERVE MY DUKE IN FLORENCE WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME SO IMPATIENTLY
I MADE GESTURES AND DIRECTED THEM TO LAND US ON THE FARTHER SHORE
THE DUKE REPLIED AT ONCE
MOST BLESSED FATHER WE BEG YOU FOR HEAVENS GRACE TO GIVE US UP THAT UNFORTUNATE MAN
XLVIII THE KING HAD NOW MADE PEACE WITH THE EMPEROR BUT NOT WITH THE ENGLISH AND THESE DEVILS WERE KEEPING US IN CONSTANT AGITATION
X THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA SAW THAT THE KING HAD BEEN VASTLY PLEASED BY MY ARRIVAL
TO THESE I ADDED IN WAX WHAT WAS WANTING FOR THE BASEMENT OF THE CROSS
AND WHEN WE CAME NEAR THE BANCHI AND OUR OWN HOUSE MY LITTLE HORSE WAS GOING IN AN AMBLE AT A FURIOUS SPEED
I HOWEVER AM BUT A POOR HUMBLE CREATURE WHO NEITHER HAVE THE POWER NOR THE INTELLIGENCE TO PERPLEX MY WITS WITH ANYTHING SO ADMIRABLE. WHEN I HAD FINISHED THIS SPEECH THE DUKE AND HIS ATTENDANTS COULD CONTROL THEMSELVES NO LONGER BUT BROKE INTO SUCH SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER THAT ONE NEVER HEARD THE LIKE
THIS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM PLYING HIS PROFESSION OF SCULPTOR
ON THE EVE OF MY PROJECTED DEPARTURE I TOLD MY FAITHFUL FRIEND FELICE TO MAKE FREE USE OF ALL MY EFFECTS DURING MY ABSENCE
WHATS THE REASON THEY GIVE THEMSELVES SUCH BEASTLY AIRS AND WILL NOT TALK TO US? TRIBOLO KEPT BEGGING ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE WHILE LAMENTONE TOLD THEM THAT WE HAD NOT THE SAME PERMISSION AS HE HAD
I WANTED TO BEGIN TO SPEAK
AND THOUGH SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE HE RECEIVED THE ORDER HE HAS NOT YET MADE ANY SIGN OF COMMENCING IT. I ANSWERED IN SURPRISE
ANY OTHER SORT OF STONE OR GLASS MINGLED WITH THE FOOD HAS NOT THE POWER TO ATTACH ITSELF BUT PASSES ONWARD WITH THE VICTUALS
AT THE SAME TIME HE GAVE ME ORDERS UNDER PAIN OF HIS DISPLEASURE NOT TO LEAVE FERRARA WITHOUT DULY INFORMING HIM
WHEN THE FEVER FELL UPON ME I RESOLVED ON HAVING RECOURSE AGAIN TO THE WOOD
HOWEVER I ASKED HIS EXCELLENCY WHAT HE WANTED ME TO SAY
ALSO BECAUSE SHE HAD TAKEN ME INTO FAVOUR THROUGH SOMETHING WHICH THE CASTELLAN HAD SAID IN MY BEHALF
MY EXAMINERS WERE FIRST THE GOVERNOR OF ROME CALLED MESSER BENEDETTO CONVERSINI OF PISTOJA 1 WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME BISHOP OF JESI
LXXXVII DURING THOSE DAYS SOME ANTIQUITIES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE COUNTRY ROUND AREZZO
AND SINCE HIS DIVINE MAJESTY HAD NOT DEEMED ME WORTHY OF BEHOLDING THE SUN EVEN IN A DREAM I BESOUGHT HIM TO LET ME KNOW THE CAUSE OF MY PUNISHMENT
NOT WITHOUT GREAT TROUBLE I SUCCEEDED IN PLACING IT AGAINST THE WALL AND THEN SWARMED UP IT BY THE FORCE OF MY ARMS UNTIL I REACHED THE TOP
CONSEQUENTLY I HAD EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAYING ALL I WANTED SINCE IT WAS THE DUKES CUSTOM TO RIDE FOUR MILES OUT OF LIVORNO ALONG THE SEA-COAST TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS ERECTING A LITTLE FORT
THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE HAD THE MOST INTENSE DESIRE TO SEE OR LEARN SOMETHING OF THIS ART. THERETO THE PRIEST REPLIED
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
I ANSWERED
LATER ON THEY GAVE ME A WELL APPOINTED BEDROOM WHERE I WENT TO REST IN A BED OF THE MOST PERFECT CLEANLINESS
GIVING UP ALL THOUGHTS OF FLORENCE EXCEPT WHAT CONCERNED THE SETTLEMENT OF MY SISTERS AND NIECES AFFAIRS I MADE PREPARATIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THEM AS WELL AS I COULD WITH THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY I HAD BROUGHT AND THEN TO RETURN TO FRANCE AND NEVER SET MY FOOT IN ITALY AGAIN
SO WE ALL ATTENDED THE DUKE UNTIL HE REACHED A CERTAIN CHAMBER WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF WITH BANDINELLO AND ME STANDING AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT
AND I WILL MYSELF GIVE YOU MORE BESIDES WHICH SHALL SURPASS THEM FAR IN VALUE. WITH THESE AGREEABLE WORDS THEY LEFT ME AND I REMAINED HIGHLY SATISFIED
WHEN HE TRIED TO TURN THE MATTER INTO JEST ON THIS EXPOSURE OF HIS BASENESS I SHOWED HIM A LETTER OF EXCHANGE FOR FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS UPON RICCIARDO DEL BENE
2 ON THIS ACCOUNT I RETIRED TO A GOOD SNUG HOUSE BEHIND THE BANCHI WHERE I WORKED FOR ALL THE FRIENDS I HAD ACQUIRED
SEVERAL BOILS APPEARED ON MY LEFT ARM TOGETHER WITH A CARBUNCLE WHICH SHOWED ITSELF JUST BEYOND THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND WHERE IT JOINS THE WRIST
THE POPE NOTICED THIS AND CRIED
I SWEAR BY GOD THAT I WILL TAKE AS LONG IN PAYING HIM AS HE HAS LAGGED IN MAKING IT. WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS EXCEEDINGLY PUT OUT AND FELL TO CURSING ALL SPAIN AND EVERY ONE WHO WISHED WELL TO IT
I KNOW THAT YOURS ARE CROWNS AND ARE SO IN GOOD SOOTH
THE CARDINAL HOWEVER PREVENTED HIM TELLING HIS MAJESTY THAT HE WAS GOING AHEAD TOO FAST SINCE I HAD AS YET PRODUCED NOTHING FOR HIM
THE TIME WAS DRAWING NIGH NOW FOR THE POPE TO TRAVEL TOWARD BOLOGNA
I SHALL FLING THE MAN WHOM YOU HAVE PUT UPON ME OUT OF WINDOWS IF I DO NOT SEE A WARRANT UNDER THE KINGS OWN HAND AND SEAL. AFTER THIS SPEECH THE TREASURER WENT OFF THREATENING AND GRUMBLING AND I REMAINED DOING THE SAME WITHOUT HOWEVER BEGINNING THE ATTACK AT ONCE
AND EACH AND ALL MADE PROFFER OF THEIR OWN LIFE TO SAVE MINE
AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A PERSON OF HIS TALENTS HE ORDERED MORE THAN THIRTY DRAWINGS TO BE MADE ALL DIFFERING IN THEIR DETAILS FOR THE PIECE THE POPE HAD COMMISSIONED
THEN HE TOLD ME TO OBSERVE THE BEAUTY OF ITS GREAT FACETS
I KNOW THAT IF YOU CHOOSE YOU WILL GET IT QUICKLY FINISHED. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS NOT WILLING TO MAKE IT THERE BUT PROMISED WITHOUT FAIL TO TAKE IT IN HAND WHEREVER I MIGHT STOP TO WORK
AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN TRAVERSED WE STOPPED AT A PLACE WHICH IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY IS CALLED VALDISTA
UPON THIS I GAVE MYSELF UP WITHOUT DOUBT AS DEAD AND IN MY SORROW HAD RECOURSE WITH PIOUS HEART TO HOLY PRAYERS
DON JUAN DE VEGA
IF GOD BUT GRANT ME TO EXECUTE MY WORK I HOPE BY ITS MEANS TO ANNIHILATE ALL MY SCOUNDRELLY ENEMIES
HEARING WHAT I HAD TO SAY WHICH I TOOK GOOD CARE THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HE IMMEDIATELY ESPOUSED MY CAUSE AND BADE FIRENZUOLA PAY ME
WHEN THIS WAS OVER THEY REQUESTED ME TO PAY THE MONEY DUE TO THEM AND THE SURPLUS I HAD PROMISED
AFTER I HAD PAID HIM THE RESPECTS DUE TO KINGS HE BOWED HIS HEAD WITH A GRACIOUS SMILE
THOUGH NUMBERS OF THEM ARE HANGED EVERY DAY IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY DID NOT CARE
BUT I REFRAINED FROM SAYING MORE THAN THESE TWO WORDS
AND WHEN THEY WERE ALONGSIDE THAT IDIOT PIERO BENINTENDI SANG OUT TO ME
I WAS TOLD THIS BY MESSER ALBERTO BENDEDIO IN FERRARA WHO WITH GREAT OSTENTATION SHOWED ME SOME EARTHENWARE COPIES HE POSSESSED OF THEM
LXXIX BEFORE LEAVING HOME I DIRECTED MY WORKPEOPLE TO PROCEED ACCORDING TO THE METHOD I HAD TAUGHT THEM
I WAS QUITE EXHAUSTED AND HAD MOREOVER FLAYED THE INSIDE OF MY HANDS WHICH BLED FREELY
THE DEMOCRATIC OR ANTI-MEDICEAN PARTY IN FLORENCE AT THAT TIME WHO ADHERED TO THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES OF FRA GIROLAMO SAVONAROLA DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY WEARING THE LONG TAILS OF THEIR HOODS TWISTED UP AND TURNED ROUND THEIR HEADS
THEN I BEGAN TO LAY ON WOOD BY DEGREES AND KEPT IT BURNING TWO WHOLE DAYS AND NIGHTS
SO WHEN WE RENEWED OUR ACQUAINTANCE IN FLORENCE WE CAME TOGETHER WITH MUCH MUTUAL SATISFACTION
TUTTA LA DIVOZIONE DI ROMA IT IS NOT VERY CLEAR WHAT THIS EXACTLY MEANS
I MADE HER REPEAT HER DEPOSITION THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION
MAESTRO FRANCESCO ADDED
1 HAVE YOU GOT IT READY? I ANSWERED
AND BEING A PERSON OF STUDIOUS HABITS HE LEFT HIS HOME BUT SELDOM
BOTH PARENTS CITIZENS OF FLORENCE
SO BID HIM BE OF GOOD COURAGE. IN DUE COURSE MESSER SFORZA DISCHARGED THIS GLORIOUS EMBASSY WHICH CONSOLED ME GREATLY
THEN I RAN DOWN TO THE BOAT WITH SOME PIECES OF THE BED-COVERS 2 IN MY POUCH AND BADE THE BARGEE START AT ONCE WITHOUT DELAY
HE REPLIED THAT HE GLADLY ACCEPTED BOTH GIFTS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE ALL THE CONVENIENCES I ASKED FOR PUT AT MY DISPOSAL
THIS IS LORENZINO DE MEDICI THE MURDERER OF ALESSANDRO WHO WAS HIMSELF ASSASSINATED BY TWO TUSCAN BRAVI IN 1548
THIS NAME THEN I HAD CUT IN FINE ANTIQUE CHARACTERS ALL OF WHICH WERE BROKEN SAVE THE FIRST AND LAST
AND FOR THIS REASON WHERE A SLOW FIRE IS WANTED AS IN THE CASE OF GUN-FOUNDRY ALDER OR PINE IS PREFERRED
HE MADE THE TOMB FOR GIANGIACOMO DE MEDICI IL MEDIGHINO IN THE CATHEDRAL OF MILAN
AND WITH HIS WONTED PRESUMPTION MUFFLED UP IN IGNORANCE SAID
A LITTLE LATER HE ARRANGED TO LEAVE FOR FRANCE WITHOUT ME
AND WHEN THE EVENING CAME WHILE THE ARMY WAS MARCHING INTO ROME THROUGH THE TRASTEVERE POPE CLEMENT APPOINTED A GREAT ROMAN NOBLEMAN NAMED ANTONIO SANTACROCE TO BE CAPTAIN OF ALL THE GUNNERS
HEARING WHICH NOTE I SAID
HE WAS PRECEDED BY TWO TORCHES AND WAS GOING IN HASTE TO THE POPE WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM
THE LETTER OF NATURALISATION EXISTS
2 THEN THEN CAME POESY WITH FIERY CALL INTO MY CARCASS BY THE WAY METHOUGHT WHENCE BREAD GOES FORTH-THERE WAS NONE ELSE AT ALL
FOR THE FERRARESE ARE A VERY AVARICIOUS PEOPLE GREEDY OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS MONEY HOWEVER THEY MAY LAY THEIR HANDS ON IT
JUST THEN THE FATHER OF THE LAD WENT BY WHO WAS PHYSICIAN TO THE CARDINAL IACOACCI 1 AND LIVED AS MEMBER OF THAT PRELATES HOUSEHOLD
WHAT WORKED MOST UPON HIS MIND WAS THAT BOTH OF THEM COMBINED TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
THE FIRST THING I FOUND WAS THAT THE HEAD OF MEDUSA HAD COME OUT MOST ADMIRABLY THANKS TO THE AIR-VENTS
EVERYBODY WAS ASTONISHED THAT I SHOULD HAVE COME OUT OF PRISON AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE THROUGH SUCH INDESCRIBABLE AFFLICTIONS
HE HAD NO INTENTION OF GIVING THE MAN MORE THAN WHAT HAD BEEN AGREED ON FOR HIS SERVICES AS GUIDE
MY POOR BROTHER GAVE VENT TO A BELLOW WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD TEN MILES AWAY
GO FIND BENVENUTO IN HIS SHOP AND TREAT HIM WITH ALL THE COURTESIES OF WHICH YOUR IGNORANT AND BRUTAL NATURE IS CAPABLE AND TELL HIM THAT IF HE IS WILLING TO FINISH THAT PIECE FOR A RELIQUARY TO HOLD THE CORPUS DOMINI WHEN I WALK IN PROCESSION I WILL ALLOW HIM THE CONVENIENCES HE WANTS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE IT
56
THE SAID MANNO LEFT MY SERVICE AND WAS RESOLUTELY BENT ON KILLING HIM
XXXIV THE WHOLE WORLD WAS NOW IN WARFARE
HEARING WHAT THE DUKE HAD SAID I WENT TO THE DUCHESS AND TOOK HER SOME SMALL BITS OF GOLDSMITHS WORK WHICH GREATLY PLEASED HER EXCELLENCY
SHE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE
LOOK THERE
WHEN WILL YOU EVER FINISH MENDING UP THOSE STATUETTES
HOWEVER THIS SHALL NOT MAKE ME CAST IN YOUR TEETH THE INSATIABLE GREEDINESS IDIOTCY AND GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGNESS OF YOUR PREDECESSORS
AND SOON THE WHOLE FLOWER OF THE YOUNG MEN OF THE BANCHI OF ALL NATIONS EXCEPT THE MILANESE CAME CROWDING IN
IT SEEMS THAT THE PERSON WHO INFORMED HIS EXCELLENCY PRAISED THEM ABOVE THEIR MERIT USING TERMS LIKE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE ANCIENTS, AND SO FORTH
MESSER BARTOLOMMEO REPROVED ME SAYING THAT THIS WAS NOT THE WAY IN WHICH ONE OUGHT TO REPLY TO THE ADVANCES OF A POPE
WHEN WE HAD FIRED TWO ROUNDS APIECE I CREPT CAUTIOUSLY UP TO THE WALL AND OBSERVING AMONG THE ENEMY A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CONFUSION I DISCOVERED AFTERWARDS THAT ONE OF OUR SHOTS HAD KILLED THE CONSTABLE OF BOURBON
ALL AT ONCE HE CRIED
REFLECTING THEN THAT BLOWS ARE NOT DEALT BY CONTRACT AND THAT SOME DISASTER MIGHT ENSUE I RESOLVED TO WREAK MY VENGEANCE BY ANOTHER METHOD
AND TAKING US BY THE HAND INTRODUCED US ONE BY ONE INSIDE IT
THE SISTINE CHAPEL IN THE VATICAN
FOR CELLINI HIMSELF IS AN EPITOME OF THAT CENTURY
FOR THE DUKE HAD SENT ME THE PLATES FROM HIS OWN BANQUET TOGETHER WITH SOME FAMOUS WINE
THE GOOD KING TOO IF HE ONCE GREW ANGRY MIGHT BRING ME INTO MISCHIEF FOR MANY OF MY ACTS IN SELF-DEFENCE
2 THIS CARTOON WAS THE FIRST MASTERPIECE WHICH MICHEL AGNOLO EXHIBITED IN PROOF OF HIS STUPENDOUS TALENTS
BUT I WILL REFRAIN FOR FEAR OF BEING PROLIX
THOU KNOWEST THAT I HAVE EXACTLY REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY AND THAT UP TO THIS HOUR I WAS NEVER THREATENED WITH A PRISON FOR ANY OF MY ACTIONS
MY FATHER SENT HIM HIS FOUR PROPHETIC VERSES
THE TWO BRONZE HEADS WERE FINISHED
THIS IS THE FAMOUS TUSCAN BRUTUS WHO MURDERED ALESSANDRO
THE DUKE PROTESTING THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THESE MATTERS PERFECTLY AND WAS QUITE AWARE WHAT COULD BE DONE
IT IS THE NATURE OF GOOD DOGS TO DIVINE AND FORETELL THE MISCHANCE COMING ON THEIR MASTERS
OF THIS PERHAPS ENOUGH IS NOW SAID
BUT ON OUR WISHING TO DISEMBARK THE BOATMEN WOULD HEAR NOTHING OF IT
I RECEIVED THE SILVER AND BEGAN MY STATUE OF JUPITER
WHEN HE HEARD THE REMARK HE LOOKED AT HIS SWORD AND CRIED OUT
I HAVE HERE TRANSLATED THE ITALIAN ANIMA LITERALLY BY THE ENGLISH WORD SOUL
AND AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO THIS POINT
BUT THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING EVEN FOR THAT GREAT COMMANDER WITHOUT A PARAGON IN HIS TIMES IN THE ART OF WAR AND ALSO WITHOUT A PARAGON IN HIS MISFORTUNES
I PRAY THEE BY THY BIRTH BY THY DEATH UPON THE CROSS AND BY THY GLORIOUS RESURRECTION THAT THOU WILT DEIGN TO LET ME SEE THE SUN IF NOT OTHERWISE AT LEAST IN DREAMS
WHAT SPIRIT TELLS THEM TO YOU? THEN HE INFORMED ME THAT COSIMO DE MEDICI THE SON OF SIGNOR GIOVANNI WAS MADE DUKE
I HAD SECURED THE ATTACHMENT OF ALL THE GUARDS AND MANY SOLDIERS OF THE CASTLE
1 WHEN I ASKED FOR CERTAIN OTHER OF MY BOOKS I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD HAVE NO MORE AND THAT I HAD GOT TOO MANY ALREADY
THEN I TURNED UPON THE OTHERS BOLDLY WITH MY SWORD
FOR ALL THY DEALINGS I THANK THEE WITH MY WHOLE HEART. THIS GREAT SORROW WENT NIGH TO DEPRIVING ME OF REASON
WHILE I WAS GETTING THESE THINGS READY WE BROUGHT THE LITTLE VASE AND OVAL BASIN TO COMPLETION WHICH HAD BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS IN HAND
WHAT GOD GIVES ME IS ALWAYS DEAR TO ME; AND WHEN HE OPENED THE SWADDLING CLOTHES HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES THE UNEXPECTED MALE CHILD
ILLUSTRIOUS ARTIST I MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF THE THREE HORSES. I REPLIED
LOOK WELL AFTER YOURSELF
NEXT I BEGGED HIM TO PACK UP THE FURNITURE OF MY HOUSE AND KEEP ACCOUNT OF IT WITH HIS USUAL LOVING-KINDNESS
AND FEW WERE THE SHOTS OF MINE THAT MISSED THEIR MARK
LXX WHILE I WAS THUS PLEASANTLY ENGAGED IN ENTERTAINING THE DUKE A PAGE HAPPENED TO LEAVE THE WARDROBE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT BANDINELLO ENTERED
THOSE DEVILS THE GERMAN GENTLEMEN LEADING THEIR LITTLE HORSES BY THE BRIDLE ACCOMPLISHED MIRACLES OF AGILITY
DID YOU NOT KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO DISPLEASE THE DUKE
IT OUGHT INDEED TO BE CALLED A LOBBY BECAUSE WHAT WE MEAN BY LOGGIA IS OPEN AT ONE SIDE
IT CAME FROM A MAN CALLED MAESTRO GIACOPINO DELLA BARCA
SEE THAT YOU DO NOT COME BACK WITHOUT IT. LXVIII MANY DAYS HAD ELAPSED DURING WHICH I HAD NOT SHOWN MY FACE IN THE PALACE WHEN THE FANCY TOOK ME TO GO THERE ONE MORNING JUST AS THE DUKE WAS FINISHING HIS DINNER
1 I TOLD THEM WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE OF MY ILLNESS AND SAID THAT I HAD WISHED TO LET BLOOD BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ADVISED AGAINST IT
THE LATTER HAD A METAL POINT ENDING IN A LARGE BALL WHICH HAD CAUSED THE FRACTURE OF MY LEG
IN ORDER THAT HIS EXCELLENCY MIGHT PERCEIVE HOW EARNESTLY I WISHED TO WORK FOR HIM I HAD ALREADY CHOSEN A CONVENIENT HOUSE IN A QUARTER MUCH TO MY LIKING
HE WILL SERVE YOUR EXCELLENCY VERY WELL TILL I RETURN WITH YOUR MEDAL FINISHED TO REMAIN FOR EVER IN YOUR SERVICE
THE KING ANSWERED IN ANGER THAT HE MEANT TO BESTOW HIS PROPERTY ON WHOM HE PLEASED AND ON A MAN WHO WOULD SERVE HIM SEEING THAT HE GOT NOTHING FROM THE OTHER
ROBERTO PUCCI WAS ANOTHER OF THE DEVOTED MEDICEAN PARTISANS WHO REMAINED TRUE TO HIS COLOURS
WE SHALL MEET ANOTHER TIME. I ANSWERED
BUT AS I SUPPOSE YOUR EXCELLENCY IS JOKING I WILL ADD NO MORE. HE REPLIED THAT FAR FROM JOKING HE MEANT SOLEMN EARNEST
THIS HORSE SEEMS TO ME TEN TIMES MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAN THE LITTLE PORTRAIT ON WHICH YOU HAVE BESTOWED SO MUCH PAINS
THIS WILL OBLIGE ME TO DEPART FROM FLORENCE AND MY ENEMIES WILL BEGIN AT ONCE TO POUR CONTEMPT UPON MY PERSEUS WHICH I HAVE ANNOUNCED AS A MASTERPIECE TO THE MOST NOBLE SCHOOL OF YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
AND WHAT I HAD DONE HAD ALL BEEN DONE IN DEFENCE OF THE BODY WHICH HIS MAJESTY HAD LENT ME
THEN I BEGAN
HE WANTED TO HAVE A MEDAL MADE WITH ATLAS BEARING THE WORLD UPON HIS SHOULDERS AND APPLIED TO MICHEL AGNOLO FOR A DESIGN
THE NECROMANCER APPEALED FOR MY SUPPORT ENTREATING ME TO STAND FIRM BY HIM AND TO HAVE ASSAFETIDA FLUNG UPON THE COALS
NOW HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST TO KEEP MY TEMPER FOR THREE DAYS
THIS CIRCULAR EMINENCE GOES ROUND THE CASTLE AND SURVEYS BOTH PRATI AND THE TOWN OF ROME
LXII WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE ROGUERY AND POWER OF THAT EVIL-MINDED PEDANT I JUDGED IT BEST TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH TO HIS INFERNAL MACHINATIONS
FOR SOME STUPID SOLDIERS HAD FILLED MY MOUTH WITH EARTH IMAGINING THAT BY SO DOING THEY WERE GIVING ME THE SACRAMENT
FELICE MY PARTNER WAS ALWAYS AT MY SIDE RENDERING THE GREATEST SERVICES WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE MAN TO GIVE ANOTHER
THE FOLK KEPT ON ATTACHING SONNETS TO THE POSTS OF THE DOOR WHICH WAS PROTECTED WITH A CURTAIN WHILE I GAVE THE LAST TOUCHES TO THE STATUE
ANGUILLARA AND PITIGLIANO WERE FIEFS OF TWO SEPARATE BRANCHES OF THE ORSINI FAMILY
AT THE END OF THIS SPEECH THE KING TURNED TOWARD ME WITH A LIVELY GESTURE AND A JOYOUS COUNTENANCE SAYING SO LET IT THEN BE DONE. AFTER THAT HE DEPARTED HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE HAD SEEN THERE
LATER ON SHE WAS AGAIN WITH CHILD AND GAVE BIRTH TO A GIRL WHOM THEY CALLED COSA AFTER THE MOTHER OF MY FATHER
ACCORDINGLY I STRENGTHENED MY HEART AND WITH ALL THE FORCES OF MY BODY AND MY PURSE EMPLOYING WHAT LITTLE MONEY STILL REMAINED TO ME I SET TO WORK
LAMENTONE TOLD NICCOLò BENINTENDI THAT HE HAD BEHAVED VERY ILL
THEN WHAT THE SORCERER HAD SAID FLASHED ALL AT ONCE UPON MY MIND
AFTERWARDS THEY SEARCHED AMONG THEIR DEAD AND WOUNDED AND SAW THAT NOT A SINGLE MAN WAS INJURED
HE WAS THE MOST REDOUBTABLE YOUNG MAN I EVER KNEW AND THE MOST HIGH-SPIRITED AND LOVED ME LIKE HIMSELF
WHAT MUST I DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ASCEND SO HIGH THAT I MAY GAZE UPON THE SPHERE OF THE SUN HIMSELF? HE POINTED OUT SOME HUGE STAIRS WHICH WERE ON MY RIGHT HAND AND SAID TO ME
YET ACCORDING TO MY HABIT I MADE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY AND ADAPTED MYSELF TO CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE
AT THIS INSTANT IF YOU CONDESCEND TO MY REQUEST I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY ALWAYS THANKING GOD AND YOUR MAJESTY FOR THE HAPPY HOURS WHICH I HAVE PASSED IN SERVING YOU. XLVI THE KING STRETCHED FORTH HIS OWN HANDS AND RAISED ME VERY GRACIOUSLY
AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
IN THE OREFICERIA CELLINI GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THESE FOILS WERE MADE AND APPLIED
A WELL-MADE ARTICLE OF THE KIND FETCHES A HUNDRED OR MORE THAN A HUNDRED CROWNS
I RETURNED THE SAME EVENING TO PARIS
LET US ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT AND WE SHALL BE FRIENDS
MEANWHILE I CONTRIVED BY MEANS OF A PUPIL OF RAFFAELLO DA URBINO TO GET AN ORDER FROM THE BISHOP OF SALAMANCA FOR ONE OF THOSE GREAT WATER-VESSELS CALLED ACQUERECCIA WHICH ARE USED FOR ORNAMENTS TO PLACE ON SIDEBOARDS
JAMES OF COMPOSTELLA
THEN I CLEANED IT WELL AND TINTED IT AFRESH WITH MY OWN
AND AT THE SAME TIME THE KING SAID
1 AND WHEN HE ENTERED HE SAID
THE FELLOW TO THIS ANSWERED ME IN FRENCH THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING
THE WHOLE HAD SUCH RICHNESS AND GOOD KEEPING THAT EVERY ONE WHO BEHELD IT EXPRESSED ASTONISHMENT AT THE FORCE OF THE DESIGN AND BEAUTY OF INVENTION AND ALSO AT THE DELICACY 2 WITH WHICH THESE YOUNG MEN WORKED
I OUGHT TO NARRATE THE REASONS WHY I HAD TAKEN THIS PORTRAIT
BENVENUTO DUKES EXPECT TO BE ANSWERED
I COMPLAINED OF THIS TO THE DUKE WHO WHEN HE SAW HOW THE MATTER STOOD TOOK IT VERY ILL AND SAID TO ME
I WILL ALLOW HIM A PENSION OF AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED CROWNS WHEN HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE ABBEY. HE NEVER GAVE ME ANYTHING
HE DIED IN 1570
MY LORD I KNOW HOW VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE IN ME
ENVIERS
THEN BEING DELIVERED FROM THAT FIENDISH FURY MY SPIRITS ROSE AND I SAID TO MYSELF
THE PRIEST WHO KEPT HIS FACE TURNED TO GOD AND HIS BACK TO ME THAT PRIEST WAS S
YET KNOWING THAT MALICIOUS FOES OUT OF THEIR ENVIOUS HEARTS HAVE PLAYED SOME KNAVISH TRICK AGAINST ME I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT TRUTH WILL PREVAIL
AND IT IS SAID THAT A CERTAIN LIONE A GOLDSMITH OF AREZZO MY GREAT ENEMY WAS COMMISSIONED TO POUND IT
THEN I RECOMMENCED
FRIEND BENVENUTO WAX IS EASY TO WORK IN
AND IF YOU SEE THAT HE HAS A MIND FOR IT WE WILL CONTRIVE THAT HE SECURES IT. ANTONIO PROFESSED GREAT CONFIDENCE IN BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE THE BARGAIN FOR THE JEWEL AT THAT PRICE
MOST BLESSED FATHER IF I DO NOT WORK IT TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MODEL LET IT BE AGREED BEFOREHAND THAT YOU PAY ME NOTHING. WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE NOBLEMEN MADE A GREAT STIR CRYING OUT THAT I WAS PROMISING TOO MUCH
THE MORNING WHEN I TOOK IT THEY MIXED IT WITH ALL I HAD TO EAT
MOST BLESSED FATHER I KNOW THE VIOLENT TEMPER OF THIS YOUNG MAN
IT WAS THE 8TH OF MAY AND THE SNOW UPON THEM LAY IN MASSES
A NATIVE OF FANO
S
S
SYMONDS RENAISSANCE IN ITALY VOL
I COULD NOT INDEED DO MUCH FEELING MYSELF IMPRISONED SO UNJUSTLY
BE UNDER NO CONCERN
MARIA DEL FIORE 4 TELLING THEM TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH ME
WHILE I WAS SITTING IN THE STREET WITH SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS POMPEO WENT BY ATTENDED BY TEN MEN VERY WELL ARMED
ITS BRILLIANCY WAS DUE TO ITS OWN EXCELLENCE
IT SO HAPPENED THAT JUST WHEN THIS WAS BEING PAID TO HIM IN FLORENCE HE STUMBLED UPON ONE OF THOSE RADICALS WHO WERE IN THE EIGHT AT THE TIME WHEN I GOT INTO THAT LITTLE TROUBLE THERE
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED DRESSING SHE WENT OFF BLASPHEMING AND CURSING ALL ITALIANS IN THE KINGS SERVICE AND SO RETURNED WITH TEARS AND MURMURS TO HER HOME
THE CASTLES BELL MUST BREAK ERE I WITH STRAIN THENCE ISSUED
THE SERVANT IN QUESTION TOLD ME THAT THE POPE WAS BEING PESTERED EVERY DAY BY MONSIGNOR DI MORLUC WHO KEPT ASKING FOR MY EXTRADITION ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH KING
THE STONE IS WORTH UPWARDS OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CROWNS WHEREAS WE VALUED IT AT BARELY TWELVE THOUSAND. THE OTHERS JEWELLERS TURNED TO HIM AND SAID
I WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IT HIM BUT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO BE SO HAUGHTY WITH A POPE
WHAT THERE IS OF GOOD IN ME YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO BEHOLD NOR CAN YOU TOUCH IT
HIS NEXT COMMUNICATION WOULD CONTAIN FULL DETAILS RESPECTING ALL THAT HE HAD PROMISED
THIS SALVIATI AND THE DE NOBILI MENTIONED AFTERWARDS OCCUPIED A DISTINGUISHED PLACE IN FLORENTINE ANNALS AS PARTISANS OF THE MEDICI
THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE FINEST AND MOST DIFFICULT CURES WHICH WAS EVER HEARD OF
THE CARDINAL WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME
TOGETHER WITH THIS BASIN I HAD BEGUN A VERY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE JUG
WHEN THE KING REPEATED IT HE SAID TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH MADAME DETAMPES
AFTERWARDS HE SUMMONED ME THROUGH HIS CHAMBERLAIN THE BOLOGNESE NOBLEMAN I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED WHO LET ME IN HIS OWN MODEST MANNER UNDERSTAND THAT HIS HOLINESS KNEW ALL BUT WAS VERY WELL INCLINED TOWARD ME AND THAT I HAD ONLY TO MIND MY WORK AND KEEP QUIET
HE WAS A FAITHFUL AND ABLE MINISTER OF CLEMENT
WHILE THESE WERE ON THEIR WAY I CLOTHED MY PERSEUS WITH THE CLAY WHICH I HAD PREPARED MANY MONTHS BEFOREHAND IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE DULY SEASONED
HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO ASK ME WHETHER I HAD EVER HAD A FANCY TO FLY
AND SO PIERO LEFT HIM WITHOUT COMING TO ANY CONCLUSION
1 THUS ACQUAINTANCE SPRANG UP BETWEEN ME AND LUIGI PULCI
THEN HE CAME TO MY HOUSE AND I CONDUCTED HIM THROUGH CERTAIN ROOMS UPON THE BASEMENT WHERE I HAD PUT THE WHOLE OF MY GREAT DOOR TOGETHER
YOU MUST KNOW THAT IT PAINS ME TO POINT OUT THE FAULTS OF YOUR STATUE
BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY IT WAS TO HIS MISFORTUNE
NOR DOES HE SEEM TO BE RESTING UPON BOTH AS SCULPTORS WHO KNOW SOMETHING OF THEIR ART HAVE OCCASIONALLY SET THE FIGURE
YOU WOULD DO FAR BETTER TO RETURN TO FRANCE WHERE YOU ARE RICH AND WELL KNOWN
SO I ACCEPTED HIS PROPOSAL WITH GOODWILL
NEXT THEY HAVE BIDDEN HIM NOT TO CROSS CERTAIN INDICATED LIMITS
IT WAS AFTERWARDS REPORTED TO ME THAT THE POPE HAS SAID
I HAVE TO REPORT A COUPLE OF WORDS MORE FROM THE POPE TO YOU AND THEN I WILL EXECUTE THE ORDERS GIVEN ME
IT WAS HIS MAJESTYS OWN PROPERTY AND CALLED THE LITTLE NELLO
THE WORD I HAVE TRANSLATED PYXES IS CIBORII VESSELS FOR HOLDING THE EUCHARIST
CELLINI PRAISES THIS MAN HOWEVER IN THE PREFACE TO THE OREFICERIA NOTE 3
ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR USED THOSE INJURIOUS TERMS MORE INSOLENTLY THAN WAS DECENT
V WHILE WE WERE MAKING OUR ESCAPE THE SONS OF THE DEAD MAN RAN TO THE DUKE OF MELFI AND BEGGED FOR SOME LIGHT HORSEMEN TO CATCH US UP AND TAKE US PRISONERS
THIS BEING GRANTED HE TOOK THE WOMEN BY THE HAND AND ARRANGED THEM ALL UPON THE INNER SIDE WITH MY FAIR IN THE CENTRE
BEING OVER AND ABOVE CONVINCED THAT MY PERFORMANCES MUST FAR EXCEED WHAT I PROMISED

AND WHEN I SHOWED IT TO HIM IT PLEASED HIM EXTREMELY
THE ONLY ADVANTAGES I HAD ENJOYED THERE WERE THE SOCIETY OF CARDINAL SALVIATI AND THE CARDINAL OF RAVENNA AND THE FRIENDSHIP OF SOME INGENIOUS MUSICIANS
YOU SEE THAT I AM AIDING MYSELF. THEN I LET MYSELF GO GENTLY BY DEGREES SUPPORTING MYSELF WITH THE SINEWS OF MY ARMS UNTIL I TOUCHED THE GROUND
MESSER ANTONIO WHO WAS CERTAINLY NOT COGNISANT OF THE PLOT AGAINST MY LIFE STIRRED UP A GREAT NOISE AND DEMANDED TO SEE THE POUNDED STONE BEING ALSO PERSUADED THAT IT WAS A DIAMOND
AND SO IN A WORK LIKE THIS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND OCCASION FOR NATURAL BRAGGING WHICH IS OF DIVERS KINDS AND THE FIRST IS THAT A MAN SHOULD LET OTHERS KNOW HE DRAWS HIS LINEAGE FROM PERSONS OF WORTH AND MOST ANCIENT ORIGIN
OU! THREE OR FOUR TIMES WHILE HE POURED HIS MONEY ON THE COUNTER WITH A GREAT NOISE
GO TO REST AND HAVE NO FURTHER FEAR! THE MEANING OF THIS WAS THAT THE CASTELLAN AFTER GIVING THE MOST CRUEL ORDERS FOR MY DEATH SUDDENLY COUNTERMANDED THEM AND SAID
EACH BULKY LOUT GROWS LIGHT LIKE GOSSAMERE
I AM NOW TAKING TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF REVENGE
HE WAS FOR MANY YEARS THE TRUSTED SECRETARY AND DIPLOMATIC AGENT OF PAUL III
ACCORDINGLY I HAD MY JUG AND BASIN PACKED UP AFTER SHOWING THEM TO THE DUKE
THAT HE TALKED AFTER THE FASHION OF THE HOVELS HE CAME FROM
I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE MAD
THEY DID NOT ALLOW ME A KNIFE HOWEVER AND SO IT WAS NO EASY MATTER TO COMMIT SUICIDE
IN THE YEAR 1539 CHARLES V OBTAINED LEAVE TO TRAVERSE FRANCE WITH HIS ARMY ON THE WAY FLANDERS
AND THEN I TURNED MY WHOLE HEART TO GOD DEVOUTLY ENTREATING HIM TO DEIGN TO TAKE ME INTO HIS KINGDOM
I DO NOT CHOOSE TO BUY THEM. WHY MY LORD WILL NOT YOUR EXCELLENCY GRATIFY ME BY BUYING THEM? BECAUSE I DO NOT CARE TO THROW MY MONEY OUT OF THE WINDOW. THE DUCHESS RECOMMENCED
THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
THE ZINGARA MAY BE A STATUE OF DIANA FORMING PART OF THE BORGHESE COLLECTION
THE CAVALIERE BANDINELLO GOT THE GATE OF SAN FRIANO
FOR WE BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT LUIGI HAD NEW SUITS OF SILK AND VELVET EVERY MORNING AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE ABANDONED HIMSELF ALTOGETHER TO BAD COURSES
STILL HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO GO AWAY WITHOUT FINDING SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR SCOLDING
1 UPON THIS MANY OF MY ACQUAINTANCES CAME TO ME AND SAID
AT THE SAME TIME I CRIED TO LIONARDO WHO WAS SHRIEKING FOR SUCCOUR JESUS
BENVENUTO I THOROUGHLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU TELL ME
THE DOCTORS WHEN THEY SAW THE FIT COMING ON HIM AND HIS OLD SERVANTS GAVE HIM ALL THE DISTRACTIONS THEY COULD THINK OF
IF I UNDERSTAND THE OBSCURE LINES OF THE ORIGINAL CELLINI WANTED TO KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BY THIS EPIGRAM--BOTH BERNARDONE AND HIS SON BACCIO
WHEN YOU SEE ME DRAW MY DIRK THROW YOURSELVES UPON THOSE SERVING-MEN AND KILL THEM IF YOU CAN
UNTIL LATELY BOTH OF THESE MASTERPIECES STOOD TOGETHER THERE WITH THE PERSEUS OF CELLINI
THESE EXCELLENT MEN WENT FORTHWITH AND PERFORMED THEIR EMBASSY
THE WORD I HAVE TRANSLATED MASSACRED ABOVE IS ASSASSINATO IT OCCURS FREQUENTLY IN ITALIAN OF THIS PERIOD AND INDICATES THE EXTREMITY OF WRONG AND OUTRAGE
I GOT THE MONEY FROM NICCOLò AND THEN WENT TO FETCH TRIBOLO WHOM I FOUND READY TO START
THUS I ENCOURAGED AND PUT HEART INTO MYSELF AND BURIED IN OBLIVION ALL THE INJURIES WHICH POMPEO HAD DONE ME
WHEN HE WAS CURED THE EIGHT WHO HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED OUT ADVERSARIES AND BANISHED THEM FOR A TERM OF YEARS SENT US ALSO INTO EXILE FOR SIX MONTHS AT A DISTANCE OF TEN MILES FROM FLORENCE
AS IT WAS UNWITTINGLY I GAVE THE FELLOW A GREAT FRIGHT
ON THE OTHER HAND IF I PERSISTED IN MY COURSE I WAS GIVING THE GAME UP TO MY ENEMIES AND FURNISHING THEM WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO DO ME MISCHIEF
DONT ASK THE POPE FOR GOLD UNLESS YOU MEAN TO DRIVE HIM INTO SUCH A FURY AS WILL RUIN YOU. I SAID
BY RETURNING I MIGHT PUT A STOP TO THEIR INTRIGUES
ACCORDINGLY WHEN THESE THINGS CAME INTO MY MIND I DECIDED FOR THE ROUTE TO FLORENCE
BUT ALL THE SAME HE LEARNED MY LESSON WELL BY HEART WITH KEEN INTELLIGENCE
FROM THIS PERIL I SAVED HIM BY KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH UPON HIM DAY AND NIGHT
THERE I BEGAN IN GODS NAME TO WORK AND FASHIONED FOUR LITTLE WAXEN MODELS ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF A CUBIT EACH IN HEIGHT
NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
I BET A BOTTLE OF THAT EXCELLENT GREEK WINE PALOMBO THE HOST KEEPS THAT IF IT KEEPS QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO POINT MY GOOD BROCCARDO SO I USED TO CALL MY GUN I WILL HIT IT IN THAT PORTION OF ITS HEAD WHICH IT IS SHOWING. SO I AIMED MY GUN ELEVATING MY ARMS AND USING NO OTHER REST AND DID WHAT I HAD PROMISED WITHOUT THINKING OF THE CARDINAL OR ANY OTHER PERSON
SOME TIME AFTERWARDS I SOUGHT TO MEND MY SHATTERED HEALTH AND WITH THIS VIEW I BETOOK MYSELF TO SHOOTING WHEN THE WINTER CAME IN
ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN ALTERING A CERTAIN CONDUIT PERTAINING TO A CISTERN AND THERE ISSUED FROM IT A GREAT SCORPION UNPERCEIVED BY THEM WHICH CREPT DOWN FROM THE CISTERN TO THE GROUND AND SLANK AWAY BENEATH A BENCH
BUT SEE THAT YOU PURGE FIRST AND THEN GO FORWARD WITH THE LOTION. THE POPE GAVE ME SOME KIND WORDS AND SO I WENT AWAY HALF SATISFIED
FOR MAFFIO THEIR OFFICER HAD MADE SOME OF THEM TURN BACK TO TAKE UP THE CORPORAL MY BROTHER KILLED
SO I TURNED WITH HASTY STEPS TO REGAIN THEM
AND AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IN ROME ALL THE MISERABLE PEOPLE WHO USED HIS OINTMENT ARE CRIPPLED AND IN A DEPLORABLE STATE OF HEALTH
NOW THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE AND SHOP FACED THE BANCHI BUT THE BACK WAS SEVERAL YARDS HIGHER BECAUSE IT TURNED TOWARD MONTE GIORDANO
THE MEAT WAS TASTED FOR ME NOW WITH GOOD GRACE AND NO NEED FOR ALTERCATION
CELLINI ALLUDES OF COURSE TO THE SACRISTY OF S
THE LOINS SEEM TO BE MODELLED FROM A BAG OF LANKY PUMPKINS
THE CARDINAL WHO WAS A VERY KINDLY LISTENER SHOWED EXTREME SATISFACTION WITH THE DESIGNS WHICH THESE TWO ABLE MEN OF LETTERS HAD DESCRIBED IN WORDS
AND THUS I SHALL PERFORM FAR GREATER AND MORE GLORIOUS REVENGES THAT IF I HAD VENTED MY RAGE UPON ONE SINGLE FOE. HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
1 HE REPLIED UPON THE INSTANT
I SHOULD LIKE YOUR EXCELLENCY TO KNOW THAT THE RASCALITIES OF BERNARDONE COMPEL ME TO ASK AS A FAVOR HOW MUCH THAT BIG DIAMOND WITH THE CROPPED POINT COST YOU
XX WHILE I WAS WORKING AT THIS PIECE LUCAGNOLO OF WHOSE ABILITY I HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN SHOWED CONSIDERABLE DISCONTENT TELLING ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT I MIGHT ACQUIRE FAR MORE PROFIT AND HONOUR BY HELPING HIM TO EXECUTE LARGE PLATE AS I HAD DONE AT FIRST
I WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
ACCORDINGLY HE WENT OFF ON HIS OWN BUSINESS AND I BEGAN WITH MY BASTION
TO MAKE AN O I DIPPED THE SPLINTER THRICE IN THAT THICK MUD
BUT NOW MY FORMER PURPOSE TO FULFIL AND SING THE DUNGEONS PRAISE WITH HONOUR DUE FOR THIS ANGELIC TONGUES WERE SCANT OF SKILL
FOR THE REST YOU NEED HAVE NO ANXIETY BUT MAY PURSUE YOUR JOURNEY WITH A LIGHT HEART. I HANDED OVER THE VASES IMMEDIATELY TWO OF THEM BEING MY OWN PROPERTY TOGETHER WITH THE SILVER AND MUCH ELSE BESIDES
I REMEMBER THAT I GAVE YOU EXPRESS ORDERS TO MAKE ME TWELVE SILVER STATUES
HE FORGETS THAT HE HAS SAID ABOVE THAT IT WAS OFFERED HIM BY LANDI FOR 17,000 DUCATS
I WAS PRESENT AT THESE TRANSACTIONS
RETURNING THANKS TO GOD THEREFORE WE ENTERED LYONS IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY AND TARRIED THERE EIGHT DAYS
AT PORTOFERRAIO
AS I HAVE REMARKED ABOVE HE HAD WITH HIM A SERVANT OF HIS WHO CAME FROM URBINO AND HAD LIVED MANY YEARS IN HIS EMPLOYMENT RATHER AS VALET AND HOUSEKEEPER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
AND WHEN HE CAME ATTENDED BY THE TWO ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN I PRODUCED THE MODEL I HAD MADE IN WAX
XCIV I HAD FORMED THE RESOLUTION AS I SAID A SHORT WHILE BACK TO GO TOWARD FRANCE
INTO THIS SAME GALLERY I TOOK MY JUPITER
THE POPE HOWEVER REFUSED AND SENT FOR ME AT ONCE AND TOLD ME I HAD SPOKEN WELL BUT THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE USE OF A BOOK OF HOURS OF OUR LADY WHICH WAS MARVELLOUSLY ILLUMINATED AND HAD COST THE CARDINAL DE MEDICI MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND CROWNS
FOR MY PART I WAS READY TO EXECUTE A GREAT NUMBER OF BRONZE BAS-RELIEFS WITH APPROPRIATE DECORATIONS
I FREQUENTLY RECEIVED VISITS ALSO FROM THE GENERAL ORAZIO BAGLIONI WHO WAS VERY WELL AFFECTED TOWARD ME
THEN WHEN I SAW THAT I HAD SURPASSED HIM I WENT ABOUT TO SURPASS MYSELF AND PRODUCED A FOIL BY NEW PROCESSES WHICH WAS A LONG WAY BETTER THAN WHAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE
THIS TURNED ITS BACK TO ME AND KEPT ITS FACE DIRECTED TO THE MADONNA AND THE CHRIST
WHILE HE LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND THE CONSTABLES SCRAMBLED OFF IN DISORDER AS FAST AS THEY WERE ABLE LEST A PAIR TO MY BROTHER SHOULD ARRIVE UPON THE SCENE
UPON THIS HE LOOKED ME HARD IN THE FACE AND SAID WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE
AND WHEN HE HAD GIVEN ME TEN GOLDEN CROWNS I BADE HIM REMOVE A FEW HAIRS FROM MY CHIN WHICH WERE THE FIRST DOWN OF MY MANHOOD
HE WAS A SOLDIER OF RIENZO DA CERI WHO WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE THAT WE WERE MAKING GAVE VENT TO A STRING OF OPPROBRIOUS SARCASMS UPON THE FOLK OF FLORENCE
HE BADE ME REMAIN IN HIS SERVICE AND PROMISED HE WOULD GIVE ME MORE THAN I DEMANDED
AND IF THE DUKE WERE TO KNOW OF YOUR BRAWLING HE WOULD HAVE YOU HANGED
WE MEANWHILE CONTINUED TALKING VERY AGREEABLY AND SUPPING
APPEARING THUS BEFORE THEM THEY CRIED OUT
WHEN MESSER GIULIANO BECAME AWARE OF THIS HE TOOK ME DOWN AT ONCE TO FONTANA BILIO 4 AND BROUGHT ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING WHO GRANTED ME A WHOLE HOUR OF VERY GRACIOUS AUDIENCE
IN MY FIRST FURY I WANTED TO STRIKE AT THE MALE
AND WHEN HE FOUND THAT I WAS PREPARED TO FORTIFY THE TOWN WITH EXPEDITION ON A SOUND PLAN HE GAVE EXPRESS ORDERS THAT ALL MY SUGGESTIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT
THE CASTELLAN WHEN THESE THINGS WERE REPORTED TO HIM SENT ME ANOTHER MATTRESS
THIS ANDREA CELLINI WAS VERY WELL VERSED IN ARCHITECTURE AS IT WAS THEN PRACTISED AND LIVED BY IT AS HIS TRADE
SO THEY LEFT ME IN THEIR CUNNING TO ENTERTAIN THE LADY WHILE THEY KEPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND
ACCORDINGLY I TOOK MY LEAVE AND HAD THE BLUE CLOTH CUT TOGETHER WITH A HANDSOME JACKET OF BLUE SARCENET AND A LITTLE DOUBLET OF THE SAME
THEREFORE IF IT IS AS YOU SAY I SHALL ALWAYS RECEIVE YOU WITH THE SAME KINDNESS AS HERETOFORE. TO THIS I ANSWERED
CHE GNENE AVVIASSE NOTE 3
AND THOUGH I WAS TOO MUCH GIVEN TO PLEASURE OWING TO THAT ACCURSED MUSIC I NEVER NEGLECTED TO DEVOTE SOME HOURS OF THE DAY OR NIGHT TO STUDY
CONSIDERING THAT HE WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD OR THEREABOUTS THE CHILDS GRIEF WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL
A GOOD DRAUGHTSMAN CAN NEVER PRODUCE BAD WORKS
SO THE SERVANT RAN UP TO HIS ROOM AND WOKE HIM CRYING
THIS MAN SUPERINTENDED THE CASKS AND CISTERNS
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS HE DIED THERE IN PANTISILEAS LODGINGS DISCHARGING THUS THE VOW HE REGISTERED SO HEARTILY TO HEAVEN
THE COMMOTION WHICH THE AFFAIR MADE WAS ENORMOUS AND LASTED A LONG WHILE
THESE WERE THE SPECIAL PATRONS OF THE MEDICEAN FAMILY BEING PHYSICIAN-SAINTS
THE DOCTORS WHO WERE CALLED IN CONSULTATION TREATED HIM WITH MEDICAMENTS BUT COULD NOT DECIDE TO AMPUTATE THE LEG WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE SAVED HIM
I HAD MADE A LIFE-SIZED BUST IN BRONZE OF BINDO ALTOVITI 1 THE SON OF ANTONIO AND HAD SENT IT TO HIM AT ROME
ACCORDINGLY I FASHIONED FOUR TINY CHILDREN IN THE ROUND AND FOUR MASKS WHICH FIGURES COMPOSED THE HOOP
SO THAT BY THE TIME I HAD FINISHED THE CLAY MODELS OF JUPITER VULCAN AND MARS AND HAD BEGUN TO GET THE SILVER STATUE FORWARD MY WORKSHOP MADE ALREADY A GRAND SHOW
FIRE FIRE
SEE ABOVE BOOK I P
WHEN I SAW THEM THUS DISMAYED MY HORSE BEING AN INTELLIGENT ANIMAL I ARRANGED THE BRIDLE ON HIS NECK AND TOOK THE END OF THE HALTER WITH MY LEFT HAND
3 BY HIM I WAS ACCOMMODATED WITH ALL THAT I REQUIRED IN THE MOST GRACIOUS WAY IMAGINABLE
ON THE DEATH OF GIOVANNI DE MEDICI IN LOMBARDY THE POPE AT THE ADVICE OF MESSER JACOPO SALVIATI DISMISSED THE FIVE BANDS HE HAD ENGAGED
2 AT LENGTH I FELT SURE THAT IT WAS ADMIRABLY FIXED AND THAT THE FILLING-IN OF THE PIT AND THE PLACING OF THE AIR-VENTS HAD BEEN PROPERLY PERFORMED
THE YOUNG MEN WHO WERE PRESENT WERE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED
UPON THAT I RETURNED TO THE MAGNIFICENT MESSER PIETRO WHO AFFECTED TO BE IGNORANT OF THE AFFAIR AND ONLY BEGGED ME WITH MARKS OF KINDNESS TO REMAIN IN PADUA
ON THIS I BADE HIM KNOW THAT I COULD SAY AND DO THINGS TO HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT LIKE AND THEREFORE HE HAD BETTER MIND HIS BUSINESS AND LET US ALONE
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER SMELT A PRISON UP TO THE AGE I THEN HAD OF THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS
AND FOR ADVICE TO SUCH AS DO NOT KNOW SWEAR THAT WITHOUT IT NONE CAN LABOUR WELL
SO I WAS DETERMINED TO SEEK BETTER FORTUNE IN A FOREIGN LAND AND WISHED TO LEAVE ROME WITHOUT COMPANY OR LICENSE
HEAVENS
THE WHOLE ROOM RANG WITH LAUGHTER AND ASTONISHMENT IN THE MIDST OF WHICH MICHEL AGNOLO ASSUMING A FIERCE ASPECT CALLED OUT FOR LEAVE TO INFLICT ON ME THE PENANCE HE THOUGHT FIT
TRUSTING TO MY BOOTS WHICH CAME HIGH UP THE LEG I PUT ONE FOOT FORWARD
I WAS ALSO REPAID WHAT I HAD SPENT UPON BUSBACCA
MICHEL AGNOLO IN HIS CARTOON PORTRAYED A NUMBER OF FOOT-SOLDIERS WHO THE SEASON BEING SUMMER HAD GONE TO BATHE IN ARNO
THAT YOU LOOK LIKE A TRUSS OF STRAW WITH CLOTHES ON AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN YOU EXCEPT GOOD LUCK. THESE WORDS REPORTED BY A MAN WHO KNEW MOST EXCELLENTLY HOW TO SAY THEM HAD SUCH FORCE THAT THEY GAINED CREDIT WITH THE POPE
AS IT MOVED SMOOTHLY FORWARDS MY CUNNING IN ITS TURN WAS AMPLY REWARDED FOR THIS GENTLE MOTION MADE THE FIGURE SEEM ALIVE
THEREFORE I FELT MYSELF AS IT WERE LURED ONWARD BY A GLEAM OF IDLE EXPECTATION
BUT I SHALL PASS SUCH MATTERS BRIEFLY BY LEST THEY HINDER ME FROM TELLING THINGS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
HE DIED IN 1571 AGED SIXTY-NINE YEARS
MAESTRO FRANCESCO THEN GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM MY ROOM AND CARRIED TO ONE OF THE HILLS THERE ARE IN ROME
CELLINI REFERS TO THE FAMOUS GIOVANNI DELLE BANDE NERE WHO WAS KILLED IN AN ENGAGEMENT IN LOMBARDY IN NOVEMBER 1526 BY THE IMPERIALIST TROOPS MARCHING TO THE SACK OF ROME
BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WHEN YOU HAD BECOME AWARE OF THE IRREPARABLE ACT BY WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE WRONGED YOURSELF IN CUTTING OFF FROM YOU A SERVANT SUCH AS EVEN NOW YOUR HOLINESS HATH SAID HE IS I AM SURE I REPEAT THAT BEFORE GOD AND THE WORLD YOU WOULD HAVE FELT NO TRIFLING TWINGES OF REMORSE
UNDER HIS MANTLE THE LAD CARRIED A FIRST-RATE SWORD AND A SPLENDID COAT OF MAIL
YET WISHING TO KEEP THEM IN EXPECTATION AND TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF COMING BACK HE CAUSED AN ANGRY LETTER TO BE WRITTEN TO ME BY HIS TREASURER MESSER GIULIANO BUONACCORSI A BURGHER OF FLORENCE
BUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE OPENED THIS VILE WAY OF DEALING DO YOU THE WORST YOU CAN IN YOUR TURN
I DO NOT WRITE THESE THINGS IN ANY WORLDLY SPIRIT OF BOASTING BUT ONLY TO RETURN THANKS TO GOD MY DELIVERER IN SO MANY TRIALS
OTHERS MORE INCREDULOUS CAME TO OBSERVE THE PHENOMENON AND WHEN THEY WERE UNABLE TO DENY THE FLASHING OF THE STATUES EYES THEY TOO DECLARED THEIR CREDENCE IN A SPIRIT--NOT GUESSING THAT THERE WAS A SPIRIT THERE AND SOUND YOUNG FLESH TO BOOT
4 THE DUKE RETURNED TO FLORENCE BUT SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING MY MODEL
AND THESE HE EXPOUNDED WITH SUCH LUCIDITY AND LEARNING THAT HIS COMMENT WAS EVEN FINER THAN THE TEXT
THAT I NEVER RECEIVED FROM THE CHURCH ANYTHING BUT WOUNDS AND STONINGS AT THAT EPOCH OF THE SACK
TO THIS MISSHAPEN HAG I SHOUTED
VIII AT THAT TIME I HAD A BROTHER YOUNGER BY TWO YEARS A YOUTH OF EXTREME BOLDNESS AND FIERCE TEMPER
THEN WE ALL OF US FELL TO ENJOYING THE ABUNDANCE OF OUR HOSTS WELL-FURNISHED TABLE
NOW THAT I AM AWARE YOU HAVE NOT YET ACQUIRED THEM IT IS RIGHT NAY MORE IT IS MY DUTY TO UTTER WHAT I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE REFRAINED FROM SAYING NAMELY THAT MY MATURE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ENABLES ME TO DETECT VERY GRAVE FAULTS IN THE PEARLS AND FOR THIS REASON I COULD NEVER ADVISE YOUR EXCELLENCY TO PURCHASE THEM. SHE REPLIED
BENVENUTO DO NOT BE UNEASY
DO NOT HOWEVER LET HIM IMAGINE THAT WHEN HIS PERSEUS SHALL BE FINALLY EXPOSED TO VIEW FROM ALL SIDES FOLK IN GENERAL WILL BE SO LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES
AND IT HAD ON THE REVERSE SIDE A VERY FINE DESIGN OF SOME LITTLE FIGURES IN THE SAME STYLE
THE DOG STROVE SO VIOLENTLY TO TEAR THE FELLOW TO PIECES THAT THE CONSTABLES WERE MOVED TO PITY
AND THEN WE SET UP CANVAS TENTS LIKE GIPSIES AND SUFFERED AT TIMES VERY GREAT DISCOMFORT
BUT WHAT GRATIFIED ME MOST AND INSPIRED ME WITH MOST HOPE OF THE DUKES SUPPORT WAS THAT THE ARTISTS SCULPTORS AND PAINTERS ALIKE ENTERED INTO THE SAME GENEROUS COMPETITION
FINDING THAT SHE WOULD NOT TAKE HER LEAVE AND BEING DRIVEN TO HIS WITS ENDS TO CONCEAL HER LIKE A PERSON OF RESOURCES HE HIT AT LAST UPON THE PLAN OF INSTALLING HER INSIDE THE STATUE
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MY WORK SHOULD BE VALUED AT ITS PROPER WORTH WHEN THERE IS NOT A MAN IN FLORENCE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING IT? THAT INCREASED HIS IRRITATION
ACCORDINGLY UPON THE DAY OF CORPUS DOMINI WHILE THE POPE WAS GOING IN PROCESSION FARNESE GOT INTO A BASKET AND WAS LET DOWN BY A ROPE TO THE GROUND
SUCH ARABESQUES ARE CALLED GROTESQUES BY THE IGNORANT
THIS SONNET IS SO INSIPID SO UNTRUE TO CELLINIS REAL PLACE IN ART SO FALSE TO THE FAR FROM SAINTLY CHARACTER OF THE MAN THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE DECLINED TRANSLATING IT HAD I NOT OBSERVED IT TO BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT TECHNICAL AND CONVENTIONAL INSINCERITY WHICH WAS INVADING ITALY AT THIS EPOCH
IT CHANCED THAT KEEPING MY EARS OPEN I THOUGHT I HEARD A SORT OF SUBDUED TITTERING IN THE STREET BELOW
SO I AM COME TO CRAVE YOUR ASSISTANCE AND TO BEG YOU TO NAME FOR HER SUCH DOWRY FROM MY ESTATE AS YOU MAY THINK SUITABLE. THE LIGHT-HEADED MAN HARDLY LET MY GOOD FRIEND FINISH WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BEFORE HE PUT IN QUITE AT RANDOM
LXVIII WHEN SOLOSMEO HAD INSPECTED HIS AFFAIRS AT MONTE CASSINO WE RESUMED OUR JOURNEY
THE CORSICAN INFLUENCED BY AVARICE HOPED TO GAIN THE WHOLE SUM OF MONEY WITHOUT RISK AND IMAGINED HIMSELF CAPABLE OF CARRYING THE MATTER THROUGH ALONE
AND THE BODY GAVE THEM HOPE OF BETTER FORTUNE
OF FARNESE I SHALL SAY NOTHING HERE BECAUSE IT WILL APPEAR IN ITS PROPER PLACE HOW WELL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HAD KILLED HIM
TWO OF YOU TAKE STICKS AND BEAT THE DOG OFF
6527
NEXT I MADE DIES FOR HALF-GIULIOS ON WHICH I STRUCK THE FULL FACE OF SAN GIOVANNI IN SMALL
OPERAI DI S
MEANWHILE HE SAID HE HAD COMMISSIONED THE MASTER OF THE MINT A CERTAIN CARLO ACCIAIUOLI AND THAT I MIGHT GO TO HIM FOR ALL THE MONEY THAT I WANTED
THIS WAS A MAGNIFICENT TOPAZ
AFTER IT IS OVER PERHAPS WE SHALL BE GLAD TO TAKE A GLASS. THEN I OPENED THE MATTER IN THIS WAY
AND FIRST I TINTED THE DIAMOND WITH MILIANOS FOIL
LET YOUR HOLINESS INQUIRE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN AND YOU WILL FIND THE TRUTH OUT. HE SAID
THE SIENESE SCULPTOR MICHEL AGNOLO OF WHOM I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SPEAKING WAS AT THAT TIME MAKING THE MONUMENT OF THE LATE POPE ADRIAN
SO THEN THEY WENT AND CAME AGAIN FROM VENICE
BUT HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT THE TERMS ON WHICH I STOOD TOWARD THAT LADY MADE ME A LITTLE MORE CIRCUMSPECT THAN I WAS WONT TO BE I SHOULD HAVE OUSTED HIM AT ONCE
31
AND THEN NOT MAINLY AS STATESMEN OR WARRIORS BUT AS CONNOISSEURS AND PATRONS OF ART
HE SAID MOREOVER THAT FOUR HUGE GIANTS HAD APPEARED WHO WERE STRIVING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INSIDE THE CIRCLE
I DID NOT CARE TO CHARGE MY GUN WITH MORE THAN A SINGLE BALL
HAVE PATIENCE MY DEAR BENVENUTO FOR I WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER REWARD FOR YOUR VIRTUES THAN THE THOUSAND CROWNS WHICH GAIO TELLS ME YOUR WORK IS WORTH. ON THIS I TOOK MY LEAVE
IS WRITTEN BY CELLINI IN HIS OWN HAND
HAVING RECEIVED THIS SUM I RETURNED WITH A LIGHT HEART AND SATISFIED TO PARIS
IT WAS THE CUSTOM AT THAT EPOCH TO ADDRESS PRINCES BY THE TITLE OF SIGNORE OR VOSTRA SIGNORIA GENTLEMEN ARMIGERI HAD THE TITLE OF MESSER SIMPLE SER WAS GIVEN TO PLEBEIANS WITH SOME CIVIL OR ECCLESIASTICAL DIGNITY
I NOW HAD MY OPPORTUNITY FOR LAUGHING AT THEM AND SAYING
WHEN THE PRELIMINARIES WERE COMPLETED HE MADE THE ENTRANCE INTO THE CIRCLE
FOR I AM REALLY FAINTING FOR WANT OF FOOD
NOW GRANT ME MY PERMISSION PRINCE
THE ANIMAL WAS CALLED TORNON BECAUSE IT WAS A GIFT FROM THE CARDINAL TORNON
AND IF THE DUKE LIKES TO HAVE IT SO? I ANSWERED
A FIRST HAIL WAS SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN PELLETS FROM A POPGUN AND WHEN THESE STRUCK ME THEY HURT CONSIDERABLY
AND SINCE YOU HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST ON EASY TERMS HIS COMMANDS NOW ARE THAT EITHER YOU SHOULD GIVE US UP HIS PIECE OR THAT WE SHOULD TAKE YOU TO PRISON. THEREUPON I LOOKED THEM VERY CHEERFULLY IN THE FACE REPLYING
SINCE I DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CAUSE OF THIS-I IMAGINED THEY WERE PAYING ME WITH BASTARD COIN FOR THE MANY KINDNESSES I HAD SHOWN THEM-I CONCEIVED THE THOUGHT OF OPENING A WORKSHOP OF MY OWN IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD
1 I HAD INVITED THEM WITHOUT RESTRAINT OR CEREMONY TO THE PLACE OF OUR MEETING AND THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING AND JOKING AS IS NATURAL WHEN A CROWD OF MEN COME TOGETHER TO MAKE MERRY ON SO GREAT A FESTIVAL
I WISHED HOWEVER TO KEEP MYSELF IN FAVOUR WITH THE DUCHESS
AND DO AS YOU HAVE PROMISED
IT HAPPENED THAT SHE WAS DELIVERED ON A NIGHT OF ALL SAINTS FOLLOWING THE FEAST-DAY AT HALF-PAST FOUR PRECISELY IN THE YEAR 1500
THEY BELONGED TO SEVERAL NATIONS ITALIAN FRENCH AND GERMAN
COME ANCORA IO AVEVO FATTO SECONDO LUSANZA CHE PROMETTAVA QUELL ARRABBIATA STAGIONE I AM NOT SURE THAT I HAVE GIVEN THE RIGHT SENSE IN THE TEXT ABOVE
THE JAIL CONTAINS ALL ARTS IN ACT AND TRUST
AND THE JEWELLERS ON THEIR SIDE HAD NOT SHOWN THEM HOW
IT SEEMS THAT MY ALLOWANCE MADE BY WAY OF CHARITY DID NOT SUFFICE FOR THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILY
AND ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT EARNED SUCH A FATE HE GAVE HIM FULL LIBERTY AND LICENSE
WHEN ASCANIO ENTERED I GAZED AT THE WHOLE COMPANY WITH EYES OF RAGE AND FRANCESCO PALE AS DEATH BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
I ALSO SAID THAT I HAD MORE TO DO IN ROME THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME
SOME TECHNICAL TERMS REQUIRE EXPLANATION IN THIS SENTENCE
AND YET I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE STUPID TO FAIL OF SUCH A MADCAP BAGATELLE
THEN TOO HOW MANY ORNAMENTS OF SILVER GOLD AND JEWELS HOW MANY MODELS AND COINS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO ESTEEMED HAVE I NOT MADE FOR HOLY CHURCH
YOU ARE A MAN OF ABILITY
THERE WAS IN ROME ANOTHER MOST EXCELLENT CRAFTSMAN OF ABILITY WHO WAS A MILANESE NAMED MESSER CARADOSSO
THE FIRST MAN I ATTACKED WAS THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAD SUED ME
BUT AS HE WAS A VERY WORTHY MAN HE REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY TO HAVE FOUND ME ALIVE
WHILE I WAS BEING ENTERTAINED IN THIS WAY THE GOVERNOR RETURNED TO THE POPE AND REPORTED ALL THAT I HAD SAID
I DREW A LITTLE DAGGER WITH A SHARPENED EDGE AND BREAKING THE LINE OF HIS DEFENDERS LAID MY HANDS UPON HIS BREAST SO QUICKLY AND COOLLY THAT NONE OF THEM WERE ABLE TO PREVENT ME
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE I WAS BORN MY FAMILIARITY WITH THEM HAS MOVED ME TO SET THEM DOWN HERE
GO QUICKLY AND FLING HIM INTO THAT DEEPEST OF THE SUBTERRANEAN DUNGEONS WHERE THE PREACHER FOIANO WAS STARVED TO DEATH
TO THESE WORDS THE COURIER REPLIED THAT HE WOULD GO WITH ME SINCE HE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE FOR TO GIVE UP THE GOBLET WOULD NOT BE TO HIS HONOUR
MY GOOD FATHER DRIVEN TO DESPAIR BY THIS FIXED IDEA OF MINE PLACED ME IN THE WORKSHOP OF CAVALIERE BANDINELLOS FATHER WHO WAS CALLED MICHEL AGNOLO A GOLDSMITH FROM PINZI DI MONTE AND A MASTER EXCELLENT IN THAT CRAFT
THE REASON OF MY JOURNEY WAS AS FOLLOWS
AT LAST IN ORDER TO END THE FEVER OF THIS IRRESOLUTION I DETERMINED TO TAKE THE POST FOR FLORENCE
WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF TO HIS EXCELLENCY HE RECEIVED ME WITH MUCH HONOUR
NEXT HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER SAYING
SO I REPLIED THAT I DID NOT HAPPEN TO HAVE BY ME THE PROPER TOOL FOR CLEANING UP HIS RING 1 AND THAT HE HAD BETTER GO TO ANOTHER GOLDSMITH
MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO LET BLOOD AS SOON AS DAY BROKE
AND WHEN HE CAME ACROSS THE MAN HE SAID
ONLY LOOK HOW MUCH OF GOLD SILVER AND JEWELS YOU HAVE HERE
THEN I BROUGHT THE KNIFES POINT WITH A SLOW STRONG GRINDING PRESSURE TO BEAR UPON THE STONE AND FELT IT CRUMBLE
MESSER DURANTE 1 HIS CHAMBERLAIN WAS BIDDEN TO BRING THEM THROUGH THE LOWER GALLERIES OF THE PALACE AND THERE TO GIVE THEM TO THE EMPEROR REPEATING CERTAIN WORDS WHICH HIS HOLINESS DICTATED TO HIM
AND SECONDLY I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT GET THE CHALICE. THE TWO MILANESE OBSERVING THE POPE INDISPOSED TOWARDS ME AT LAST SO FAR PREVAILED THAT HE DEPRIVED ME OF THE MINT AND GAVE IT TO A YOUNG PERUGIAN COMMONLY KNOWN AS FAGIUOLO
HERE ONE LIVES IN QUITE A DIFFERENT FASHION
AND I ASSURE YOU THAT IF YOU REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN ME I FEEL MYSELF THE MAN TO SETTLE MATTERS
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE BODY IS LEANING FORWARD MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF A CUBIT WHICH ALONE IS THE GREATEST AND MOST INSUPPORTABLE FAULT COMMITTED BY VULGAR COMMONPLACE PRETENDERS
HE WAS GIROLAMO SCHIO OR SCHEDO A NATIVE OF VICENZA THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT AND CONFESSOR OF CLEMENT VII WHO OBTAINED THE SEE OF VAISON IN THE COUNTY OF AVIGNON IN 1523 AND DIED AT ROME IN 1533
I WAS VERY WILLING AND ORDERED A HANDSOME COLLATION FOR THEIR ENTERTAINMENT
LXII NO SOONER HAD THE GOVERNOR RETURNED TOGETHER WITH THE PROCURATOR FROM THE PALACE THAN HE SENT FOR ME AND SPOKE TO THIS EFFECT
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PUT TOGETHER EIGHTY PEARLS WHICH COULD SHOW BETTER THAN THESE DO IN A NECKLACE
3 HE TOLD ME I WAS ALWAYS JOKING BUT THAT HE MUST REALLY GO BACK FOR HIS STRAPS
SHE WANTED THE MARBLE FOR BANDINELLO ADDING
NOW AM I CONVINCED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER. I RETORTED
NONE OF THEM SPOKE A WORD BUT THEY REFERRED MY PRAYER TO THE UNFORTUNATE CASTELLAN WHO HAD MADE INQUIRIES CONCERNING WHAT I SAID
WHEN THESE THINGS HAD BEEN CUT OUT I WENT TO SEE THE POPE WHO TOLD ME TO SPEAK WITH MESSER AMBRUOGIO
TELL HIM TO MIND HIS HEALTH AND WHEN HE IS RECOVERED WE WILL MAKE IT UP TO HIM FOR ALL HIS TROUBLES. THOSE TWO EXCELLENT MEN RETURNED AND TOLD ME THE GOOD NEWS THEY WERE BRINGING FROM THE POPE
NEXT DAY HAVING MADE MY PREPARATIONS I WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF THE DUKE WHOM I FOUND IN THE PALACE OF THE PAZZI AT THAT TIME INHABITED BY THE WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF SIGNOR LORENZO CIBO
WHAT I AM NOW TELLING YOU I SAY IN SELF-DEFENCE
AND BESIDE THEIR BRINGING NO LESS HONOUR THAN LARGE SILVER PLATE THERE WAS ALSO MORE PROFIT TO BE MADE BY THEM
I RENEWED MY INTIMACY WITH FRANCESCO DI FILIPPO
HE RECEIVED ME WITH MUCH COURTESY AND ORDERED THAT WATER SHOULD BE BROUGHT FOR ME TO WASH MY HANDS BEFORE EATING
IT IS NOT YOU WHO GIVE THEM ME
THEN I TRACKED SOME OF THE YOUNG BIRDS AND EVERY OTHER DAY KILLED ONE WHICH FURNISHED US WITH ABUNDANCE OF MEAT OF SUCH EXCELLENT QUALITY THAT WE SHOOK OUR SICKNESS OFF
CITIES AND GREAT PALACES ARE BUILT WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF DUCATS. I REJOINED
THIS CARDINAL AND POPE WAS GIULIO A NATURAL SON OF GIULIANO LORENZO DE MEDICIS BROTHER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED IN THE PAZZI CONSPIRACY YEAR 1478
THIS WAS THE FAMOUS FRANçOIS DE TOURNON MADE CARDINAL IN 1530 AND EMPLOYED AS MINISTER BY FRANçOIS
BANDINI BEARS A DISTINGUISHED NAME IN FLORENTINE ANNALS
HIS MANNER SHOWED CLEARLY THAT IT GAVE HIM GREAT SATISFACTION
DURING THE SHORT SPACE OF TIME I HAD TO LIVE I BEGGED HIM TO ALLOW ME ONE LOAF A DAY FROM HIS OWN STORES SEEING THAT I HAD RESOLVED TO EAT NOTHING WHICH CAME FROM THEM
HE WAS LIVING LIKE A LORD AND EXECUTING A GREAT WORK FOR THE DUKE OUTSIDE THE CITY GATES IN A PLACE CALLED DEL TE
IT WAS THEN REGISTERED AT THE CAPITOL
1 THEN I SHALL RETRACE MY STEPS BY SAN FRANCESCO DELLA VERNIA AND STILL WITH THANKS TO GOD RETURN LIGHT-HEARTED TO YOUR SERVICE. THE DUKE REPLIED AT ONCE WITH CHEERFUL KINDNESS
NEXT MORNING A PIECE OF MARBLE WAS BROUGHT TO MY HOUSE
THAT MORSEL OF ITS HEAD IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR ME TO SHOOT IT BY IF IT ONLY STAYS TILL I CAN POINT MY GUN. THE GENTLEMEN PROTESTED THAT EVEN THE MAN WHO INVENTED FIREARMS COULD NOT HIT IT
WHEREAS IF YOU SEND TO ASK AFTER HER OR VISIT HER SHE WILL GIVE HERSELF AIRS AND KEEP AWAY. ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING CATERINA CAME TO OUR DOOR AND KNOCKED SO VIOLENTLY THAT BEING BELOW I RAN TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS A MADMAN OR SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD
BUT SINCE THE PROVOST MADE NO USE OF THE CASTLE HIS MAJESTY PERHAPS MIGHT GRANT IT ME TO EMPLOY IN HIS SERVICE
IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS MAY IT 5 NEVER VEX US MORE! ATTRACTED BY THIS DISPUTE A NEIGHBOUR PUT HER HEAD OUT FROM WHOM I LEARNED THAT MY FATHER AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE HAD DIED OF THE PLAGUE
THE PRINCE WAS DON FRANCESCO THEN AGED TWELVE
SHE HAD BEEN ABOVE AND NOW DESCENDING TO THE GROUND-FLOOR ASKED MADONNA PORZIA WHAT SHE WAS DOING THERE
MOREOVER MY TEETH BEGAN TO PERISH IN MY MOUTH
DO YOUR UTMOST TO OBEY MY COMMANDS
POPES HAVE AUTHORITY TO LOOSE AND BIND THE WHOLE WORLD AND WHAT THEY DO IS IMMEDIATELY RATIFIED IN HEAVEN
ARGENTAN THE CITY OF THE DUCHY OF ALENCON
ALWAYS SINGING AND LAUGHING WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT OUR DESTINATION
PERHAPS ALL THE AFFECTION AND REVERENCE I HAVE FOR THE CITY OF ROME, OR MERELY ALL MY TIES IN ROME. LXXXII ON THE JOURNEY TO ROME I CARRIED WITH ME THAT HANDSOME ARQUEBUSE WHICH THE DUKE GAVE ME
AND WHEN THE WORMWOOD WAS WELL SOAKED HE LAID IT ON MY BREAST JUST WHERE THE BRUISE WAS VISIBLE TO ALL
3 I VERY GLADLY SET MYSELF TO THE TASK AND IN A FEW WEEKS I FINISHED MY MODEL WHICH WAS ABOUT A CUBIT HIGH IN YELLOW WAX AND VERY DELICATELY FINISHED IN ALL ITS DETAILS
HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE GIFT AND PRAISED ME AS NO ARTIST WAS EVER PRAISED BEFORE
WHEN I SAW THAT HE WAS SO INCLINED TO LABOUR I ASKED WHETHER HE WOULD ENTER MY SERVICE AND WE AGREED UPON THE SPOT
THEN I SEARCHED THE SPOT WELL AND JUDGED AND ASCERTAINED THAT I HAD SUSTAINED NO INJURY OF CONSEQUENCE THERE
PEOPLE INDEED SAID THAT WHEN A TREATY OF PEACE WAS AFTERWARDS CONCLUDED MADAME DETAMPES WHO TOOK MORE PART IN IT THAN ANYBODY ELSE BETRAYED THE KING
AND FROM WHAT I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED HE WAS THE MAN WHOM I HAD FIRST NOTICED ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE REST
FEAR NOT VILE COWARD
IN THIS PHRASE VARY AND THE MEANING IS NOT QUITE CLEAR
AND WHEN I HAD HEARTENED UP MYSELF I CONTINUED READING IN THE BIBLE AND MY EYES BECAME SO USED TO THAT DARKNESS THAT I COULD NOW READ FOR THREE HOURS INSTEAD OF THE BARE HOUR AND A HALF I WAS ABLE TO EMPLOY BEFORE
AT THE LAST JUST WHEN HE WAS TAKING LEAVE I POINTED OUT UPON THE LAWN OF THE CASTLE THAT GREAT GIANT WHICH ROUSED HIM TO HIGHER ASTONISHMENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS HE HAD INSPECTED
THE SUBSTANCE WAS AS FOLLOWS
4 QUITTING OUR POSITION ON THE RAMPARTS WE CROSSED THE CAMPO SANTO AND ENTERED THE CITY BY ST PETERS
THERE IS INDEED GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE KINGS MISTRESS IN HER JEALOUSY OF THE DAUPHIN AND DIANE DE POITIERS PLAYED FALSE AND ENABLED THE IMPERIALISTS TO ADVANCE BEYOND EPERNAY
THEN I SOFTENED HIS TEMPER BY SUGGESTING THAT IF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY DID NOT CARE TO HAVE THE DOOR BEGUN TWO PULPITS HAD ANYHOW TO BE MADE FOR THE CHOIR AND THAT THESE WOULD BOTH OF THEM BE CONSIDERABLE WORKS WHICH WOULD CONFER GLORY ON HIS REIGN
THEY SAY THAT JOVE USED IT WITH GANYMEDE IN PARADISE AND HERE UPON THIS EARTH IT IS PRACTISED BY SOME OF THE GREATEST EMPERORS AND KINGS
AFTERWARDS HAVING CONFIDENCE IN YOU HE ORDERED YOU TO SEW THEM INTO HIS CLOTHES
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DECREE FOR WHICH I WAITED SEVERAL MONTHS I HAD HIM THROWN INTO PRISON
I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY ALL I KNOW. NOW SUBSEQUENTLY TO THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE DUCHESS I HAD BEEN TOLD BY SOME ONE POSSIBLY A ROGUE THAT HE HAD HEARD HOW THE DUKE SAID UPON SOME OCCASION WHICH OFFERED ITSELF
NOW I HAD TAKEN WITH ME TO SERVE AS GUIDE A YOUNG WORKMAN IN MY EMPLOY WHO CAME FROM BAGNO AND WAS CALLED CESARE
LET US GO TO ALBERTACCIO DEL BENES HOUSE
AND AT LAST JUST AT THE SAME HOUR AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY SHE IRRITATED ME TO SUCH A PITCH THAT I GAVE HER THE SAME DRUBBING
IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH THE FELLOW HAD HE NOT CALLED FOR HELP TO CERTAIN TAILORS PRAYING THEM FOR GODS SAKE TO SAVE HIM FROM A MAD DOG
FOR ALL THIS WHILE IVE FELT AS THOUGH MY GUTS WERE IN THE SAUCEPAN. I MADE ANSWER
THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS THAT WHILE I WAS CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS UP THOSE STEPS A SERVANT OF CARDINAL CORNARO RECOGNIZED ME
AND HERE ART EQUALLED NATURE
NEVER IMAGINING THAT THE MATTER STOOD PRECISELY AS THE DUKE AVERRED WE LAUGHINGLY MADE LIGHT OF HIS SUPPOSED CREDULITY
FOR THESE THE PROPER NAME IS THEREFORE MONSTERS AND NOT GROTESQUES
AT BOLOGNA WHERE IN 1529 HE HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM THE IMPERIAL CROWN
4
WE SPOKE MANY WORDS OF COURTESY ON BOTH SIDES
IT PLEASED HIM EXCEEDINGLY
BUT WHEN I RETURNED TO VICCHIO THE PRIEST SER FILIPPO SAID TO ME
BUT THE HONOUR OF FIRING THE ARQUEBUSE WHICH BROUGHT HIM DOWN CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR
WHEREFORE THEN MUST MY INNOCENCE BE MADE TO PAY THE DEBTS OF WHOM I DO NOT EVEN KNOW
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY BUSINESS TO PATCH UP STATUES THAT BEING THE TRADE OF BOTCHERS WHO DO IT IN ALL CONSCIENCE VILLAINOUSLY ILL
AND AFTER PAYING HIS WAGES I TOLD HIM HE MUST LEAVE MY SERVICE
HIS BROTHER WAS A SOLDIER OF GIOVANNI DELLE BANDE NERE AND DUKE ALESSANDRO
FOR THOUGH I DID SO ONLY TO REVISIT FLORENCE MY SWEET BIRTHPLACE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CHARITABLY SUCCOUR MY SIX NIECES THIS GOOD ACTION AS I WELL PERCEIVED HAD BEEN THE BEGINNING OF MY GREAT MISFORTUNE
I COMPLAINED TO THE DUKE OF THE ANNOYANCE WHICH THE BRUTE GAVE ME AND BEGGED HIM TO ALLOW ME SOME OF THE LABOURERS FROM THE OPERA
ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE HOUNDS AND DIVERS DOGS OF THE CHASE OF SEVERAL SPECIES SUCH AS MAY BE SEEN IN THAT FAIR FOREST WHERE THE FOUNTAIN SPRINGS
CELLINI ALWAYS WRITES IT AS ABOVE
YOU MUST KNOW MY LADY THAT I WOULD NOT SELL IT FOR TWO THOUSAND GOLDEN DUCATS
INDEED THERE GREW IN ME SO GREAT A SPIRIT TO DO WELL THAT TO THIS EVENT I ATTRIBUTED WHAT WILL AFTERWARDS BE RELATED OF MY PROGRESS
XCVI ABOUT THAT TIME I WAS VERY INTIMATE WITH GIROLAMO DEGLI ALBIZZI 1 COMMISSARY OF THE DUKES MILITIA
ASCANIO TROUBLED BY HIS QUARTAN AND I BY A SLOW FEVER WHICH I FOUND IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO THROW OFF
THIS MAN WAS CALLED SGUAZZELLA
THE FARFA MENTIONED BELOW IS A VILLAGE OF THE SABINE HILLS
MESSER DURANTE CAME FORWARD AND ROBBED ME OF MY FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS
WHEN THE TOWING-HORSES HAD BEEN HARNESSED TO THE CABLE I ORDERED THE PEOPLE NOT TO STIR BEFORE I RETURNED FOR I HAD LEFT A PAIR OF SLIPPERS IN MY BEDROOM
ALL THIS HAPPENED IN MY CASE AND THINKING IT A MOST DISGRACEFUL BREACH OF JUSTICE I MADE MY APPEARANCE IN THE GREAT HALL OF PARIS TO DEFEND MY RIGHT
HE WAS WILLING AND SO WE MADE OUR BARGAIN
THE NEIGHBOURS THEREFORE TOOK TO CLIMBING THEIR HOUSE-ROOFS AND CROWDS CAME ON PURPOSE TO ENJOY THE SPECTACLE
QUI MI FACCIA MEMORIA DI QUEL BENE
GOD PRESERVE ME FROM EVER THINKING OF SUCH A THING
THE DUCHESS WHO WAS PRESENT FROWNED AND SAID
THAT WORTHY MAN MAESTRO FRANCESCO DA NORCIA REDOUBLED HIS EFFORTS AND BROUGHT ME EVERY DAY FRESH REMEDIES TRYING TO RESTORE STRENGTH TO MY MISERABLE UNSTRUNG FRAME
GIROLAMO BELLARMATI A LEARNED MATHEMATICIANS AND MILITARY ARCHITECT BANISHED FROM SIENA FOR POLITICAL REASONS
THE DOOR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN HUNG UPON HINGES WITH PLATES NAILED INTO THE POSTS
THE FOG PREVENTED ME FROM BEING CERTAIN WHETHER HE WAS ON HORSEBACK OR ON FOOT
THEN I BEGGED HIM TO GRANT ME THE FAVOUR OF LEAVING ME WHERE I WAS AND TOLD HIM OF THE GREAT COURTESY WHICH CORNARO HAD SHOWN ME
THEY EXCLAIMED
DON FRANCESCO DE BOBADILLA
THEN WE ORDERED DINNER
BUT AS IT IS BUT WATER I KNOW WELL THAT THEY HAVE NO MORE PLEASURE THAN WE HAVE IN DROWNING THERE. THE LAKE WAS FIFTEEN MILES LONG AND ABOUT THREE BROAD
NOTHING SEEMS TO BE KNOWN ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HIS IMPRISONMENT IS MENTIONED IN A LETTER OF CAROS UNDER DATE 1540
I FOUND MY FRIEND AND HE WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME
THESE TOYS HATH GLORY FOR HER NURSLING WROUGHT
I TOO RECOGNISED A LITTLE RING
THIS EVENTUALLY CAUSES DEATH
HE ANSWERED THAT ANY TIME WOULD DO FOR HIM AND I THAT I WAS ALWAYS READY
ON IT BECOMING CLEAR THAT SHE RETURNED MY AFFECTION HER MOTHER PERCEIVED HOW THE MATTER STOOD AND GREW SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
FOR YOU WILL GET NOTHING FROM ME BEYOND THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS
BEING THEN CONVINCED THAT THE TRICK PROCEEDED FROM HIS ROGUE OF A TREASURER I GAVE THE RING TO A FRIEND OF MINE BEGGING HIM TO RETURN IT TO THE CHAMBERLAIN FIASCHINO AS HE BEST COULD
TO WHICH I ANSWERED
THEY SAY TOO THAT HERCULES HAS ONE OF HIS FEET UNDERGROUND WHILE THE OTHER SEEMS TO BE RESTING ON HOT COALS. NOTE 1
OF THE FLORENTINE PAINTER II ROSSO OR MAITRE ROUX THIS IS THE FIRST MENTION BY CELLINI
WHEN I RETURNED TO MY LODGING I FOUND LETTERS FROM THE CARDINAL DE MEDICI IN WHICH HE TOLD ME TO COME BACK POST-HASTE TO ROME AND TO DISMOUNT WITHOUT DELAY AT THE PALACE OF HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP
I REPLIED THAT I SHOULD COMPLETE MY WORK WITH GREATER DILIGENCE AND APPLICATION THAN ANY I HAD YET ATTEMPTED BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST HOPE OF HAVING ANY REWARD WHATEVER FROM THE POPE
MICHEL AGNOLO MADE THIS ANSWER
AND WHEN WE REACHED THE APARTMENTS OF THE POPE HE BEING KNOWN THERE AND I EXPECTED WE WERE AT ONCE ADMITTED
I CHOSE ONE OF MY SHOP-LADS WHO WAS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND INVITED VINCENZIO ROMOLI AGAIN
YOU SEE THAT I HAVE RECAPTURED YOU! YES, SAID I BUT YOU SEE THAT I ESCAPED AS I TOLD YOU I WOULD
THE DUKE AND HIS ATTENDANTS PREPARED THEMSELVES TO LISTEN
WHAT HAVE YOU COME TO DO HERE
I HAD WALKED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PACES WHEN PILOTO THE GOLDSMITH MY VERY GOOD FRIEND CAME UP AND SAID
FOR I WAS ALIVE WITH PLENTY OF MONEY A FELLOW TO WAIT ON ME AND A GOOD HORSE
I WILL ADDUCE SO SOUND AN ARGUMENT THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY SHALL PERCEIVE THE FULL FORCE OF IT. SO I BEGAN
MORE THAN TWO MONTHS PASSED THUS
IN HIS ROOM REMAINED HIS BROTHER MESSER ANTONIO UGOLINI WHO HAD INFORMED THE DECEASED GOVERNOR THAT I WAS DULY RELEASED
I HAD ALREADY MADE THREE LITTLE FIGURES OF GOLD IN THE ROUND ABOUT A PALM HIGH
BENVENUTO I AM CONVINCED THAT THE DUKE WILL SHOW YOU A DIAMOND WHICH HE SEEMS DISPOSED TO BUY
HIMSELF HAD HEARD ME SPEAK SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH THAT HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK I SHOULD WHEN PUSHED TO PROOF END IN A DISHONOURABLE FAILURE
SOME OF THE STONES AND BRICKS OF THE VAULT WHICH FELL WITH HIM BROKE BOTH HIS LEGS
WELL DID I KNOW THAT IT WAS YOU YOU WHO PUT OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF MY CHERISHED WISH
LORENZO DESIGNED BY MICHEL ANGELO WITH THE PORTRAITS OF THE MEDICI AND STATUES OF DAY NIGHT DAWN AND TWILIGHT
ELSE SHALL I SHOW MYSELF A BRUTE BEAST THERE
LVI I CONTINUED TO WORK FOR THE POPE EXECUTING NOW ONE TRIFLE AND NOW ANOTHER WHEN HE COMMISSIONED ME TO DESIGN A CHALICE OF EXCEEDING RICHNESS
HE GAVE ME TEN DAYS FOR THESE PREPARATIONS
AND I VERY OFTEN WHEN I MET THEM PAID THE LATTER SEVERAL TIMES AS MANY GOLDEN CROWNS AS THEY HAD GIVEN GIULIOS FOR SOME OBJECT
NOW BENVENUTOS RETORT WAS SO SWAGGERINGLY INSOLENT THAT IT AMOUNTED TO THROWING DOWN A CARTEL
SEEING THEN THAT HE COULD NOT SAP MY HONOUR BY THE SUBTLE AND INGENIOUS SOPHISTRIES HE SO ELOQUENTLY DEVELOPED THE FRIAR HIT UPON ANOTHER WAY OF TEMPTING ME
THAT THUS IS WAS CAN VERY WELL BE SEEN AND CANNOT BE DENIED BUT THE SAID BUILDINGS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF ROME
BENVENUTO HAS OUTDONE THE FOIL OF MILIANO. GAIO UNWILLING TO BELIEVE IT TOOK THE DIAMOND AND SAID
THEN HE BROKE OUT INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER AND SAID
IN THIS WAY FINALLY YOU WILL NOT THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY NOR DISCOURAGE A BAND OF ARTISTS THE LIKE OF WHOM IS NOT TO BE FOUND AT PRESENT IN THE WORLD AND WHO FORM THE GLORY OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY. THE DUKE LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST GRACIOUSNESS
BUT THAT IF I GAVE THEM LEAVE TO ACT UPON THEIR OWN PRINCIPLES THEY WOULD BRING THE BRONZE OUT AS CLEAN AND PERFECT AS THE CLAY
1 AND THOUGH THESE HAVE A CERTAIN GRACE THEY DO NOT YIELD SO LASTING A PLEASURE AS THE PATTERNS WHICH WE USE
WHICH INDEED DID AFTERWARDS HAPPEN
TWO OR PERHAPS THREE DAYS AGO A WOMAN AND A GIRL CAME BACK TO A HOUSE IN MY NEIGHBOURHOOD
HOWEVER THE FOLK KEPT US ASUNDER
IT WAS THE AGE OF MICHELANGELO AND IN THE THRONG OF GREAT ARTISTS WHICH THEN FILLED THE ITALIAN CITIES CELLINI WAS NO INCONSIDERABLE FIGURE
FURTHERMORE I REMEMBERED WHAT THE PRIEST HAD SAID ABOUT SBIETTAS DOING SUCH A FINE STROKE OF BUSINESS BY THE SALE OF HIS FARM TO AN OLD MAN FOR LIFE WHO COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO SURVIVE A YEAR
THIS I DID UPON A CIRCULAR PIECE OF BLACK STONE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LITTLE TRENCHER
EIGHT YEARS HAD THEREFORE NOW ELAPSED
I WAS BEGINNING TO HANKER AFTER THE ADVENTURE MORE THAN HE DID
THE GIULIO WAS A COIN OF 56 ITALIAN CENTIMES OR 8 TUSCAN CRAZIE WHICH IN FLORENCE WAS ALSO CALLED BARILE OR GABELLOTTO BECAUSE THE SUM HAD TO BE PAID AS DUTY ON A BARREL OF WINE
A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THIS HE OBTAINED HIS PLACE AGAIN AMONG THE FIFERS
ALBEIT JUST THEN I FELT AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN MASSACRED I SENT FOR ONE OF MY COUSINS CALLED MAESTRO ANNIBALE THE SURGEON FATHER OF MESSER LIBRODORO LIBRODORI DESIRING THAT HE SHOULD GO BAIL FOR ME
THE BOAT IS ENGAGED FOR US AND NO ONE ELSE AND IT GRIEVES ME TO THE HEART THAT I AM NOT ABLE TO HAVE THEIR COMPANY. AT THESE WORDS A BRAVE YOUNG MAN OF THE MAGALOTTI FAMILY SPOKE OUT
I OUGHT THEREFORE TO THINK MYSELF OF SOME ACCOUNT SEEING SHE HELD ME FOR HER MORTAL ENEMY
AT THIS TIME I BEGAN COMPOSING A CAPITOLO IN PRAISE OF MY PRISON RELATING IN IT ALL THE ACCIDENTS WHICH HAD BEFALLEN ME
AND MUCH ADMIRATION WAS ROUSED IN ME BY THAT EXTRAORDINARY MAN THE VERY IMAGE OF PLUTO WHO LISTENED WITH MARKED ATTENTION FIRST TO ONE AND THEN TO THE OTHER ANSWERING EACH WITH LEARNING AND SAGACITY
I ALSO REMEMBERED MY COUSINS WHO WERE NUNS IN VITERBO THE ONE ABBESS AND THE OTHER CAMERLINGA 2 AND WHO HAD THEREFORE THAT RICH CONVENT UNDER THEIR CONTROL
HE LAUGHED ME IN THE FACE AND SAID THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO THINK OF IT AT THE END OF THREE YEARS
PRINCE PERHAPS I HAVE MADE HIM TOO MANY PROMISES. HE REPLIED
AND THUS IN SOOTH SHALL IT BE
AH
AH
OH
I NEVER HAD AN ARTIST WHO PLEASED ME MORE NOR ONE WHO DESERVED BETTER TO BE WELL REWARDED
UPON THE DEATH OF THIS URBINO MICHEL AGNOLO WROTE A TOUCHING SONNET AND A VERY FEELING LETTER TO VASARI
AND SEEING MY WORK FINISHED I FELL UPON MY KNEES AND WITH ALL MY HEART GAVE THANKS TO GOD
THEREUPON I TURNED ROUND TO OUR GUIDES AND ORDERED THEM TO HELP THE BRUTE ADDING THAT I WOULD SEE THEM PAID
THAT IS FRANK THE FIFERS SON
AND WHERE MY OWN POWER COULD NOT REACH TWAS HE WHO RESCUED THEM AGAINST YOUR EXPECTATION OUT OF YOUR VIOLENT HANDS. ON LEAVING THE MAN HE WROTE ME ALL THIS STORY BEGGING ME FOR GODS SAKE TO PRACTISE MUSIC AT TIMES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT NOT LOSE THE FINE ACCOMPLISHMENT WHICH HE HAD TAUGHT ME WITH SUCH TROUBLE
THE POPE REGARDED IT WITH STUPEFACTION AND EXCLAIMED
IF I WERE IN THAT YOUNG MANS BODY I SHOULD GO OFF WITHOUT ASKING LEAVE. MADONNA PORZIA REPLIED THAT VIRTUES RARELY ARE AT HOME WITH VICES AND THAT IF I DID SUCH A THING I SHOULD STRONGLY BELIE MY GOOD LOOKS OF AN HONEST MAN
ADIEU MON AMI, WHICH IS A PHRASE NOT OFTEN USED BY KINGS
FOR THOUGH POVERTY IS OFTENTIMES THE CAUSE OF BRINGING MEN TO DEATH ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN THE VERY CAUSE OF MY SALVATION
VASARI SAYS HE CAME TO PARIS IN 1541
GIULIO LIVED TO BECOME POPE CLEMENT VII TO SUFFER THE SACK OF ROME IN 1527 AND TO MAKE THE CONCORDAT WITH CHARLES V
HE BADE ME LOOK AROUND THE ROOM AND SAID
MY DEAR FELICE AND I WENT TOWARD FLORENCE IN A PAIR OF BASKETS
QUESTO SI è COME PASSARE IN FRA LE PICCHE NOTE 2
BUT THIS HAD NO EFFECT OF SHAKING MY DETERMINATION
AND AS THEIR TRENCHES WERE LESS THAN A STONES-THROW RIGHT BELOW US I WAS ABLE TO INFLICT CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE ON THEM WITH SOME USELESS MISSILES 2 OF WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL PILES FORMING THE OLD MUNITION OF THE CASTLE
ACCORDINGLY I TOOK IT
BUT NOW THAT HE HAD KEPT HIM TWO DAYS WITHOUT INFORMING ME I WAS RESOLVED HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HIM
AFTER THE MUSIC WAS OVER A CERTAIN AURELIO ASCOLANO 6]REMARKABLE FOR HIS GIFT AS AN IMPROVISATORY POET BEGAN TO EXTOL THE WOMEN IN CHOICE PHRASES OF EXQUISITE COMPLIMENT
IT WAS MY PURPOSE TO FINISH IT AND THEN TO BID FAREWELL TO FLORENCE
WHEN I RETURNED TO MY SHOP THE CORSICAN INFORMED ME THROUGH AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF HIS AND MINE THAT I NEED NOT BE ON MY GUARD AGAINST HIM SINCE HE WISHED TO BE MY GOOD BROTHER
HE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND SAID HE WAS WILLING BUT THAT HE DID NOT WISH ME TO SERVE AND THAT I MUST MAKE SOME ARRANGEMENT WITH THE OTHER MACE-BEARERS TO BE EXEMPTED
AND IF YOU SAY A PATERNOSTER LET IT BE SAN GIULIANOS. 2 THEN I DROVE THE WHOLE LOT FORTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER LAMMING INTO THEM WITH FIST AND FOOT
HE SAYS TRUE-HE SAYS TRUE
BEHOLD YOUR BOX THEN WHICH HAS BEEN OPENED AND INSPECTED BY HIS HOLINESS. I LIFTED UP MY VOICE AT ONCE AND SAID
THE ERMO IS MORE CORRECTLY EREMO AND VERNIA IS ALVERNIA
ACCORDINGLY I FORMED MY RESOLUTION AND BEGAN
THESE WORDS WERE IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT ME BY A PAGE OF CARDINAL FERRARA CALLED IL VILLA WHO SAID HE HAD HEARD THE KING UTTER THEM
I FOUND HIM AFTER HIS EXCELLENCYS DINNER IN THE HALL OF THE CLOCK
MY DEAR BEATRICE ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH WHAT I OFFERED? SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WAS NOT
AND THE ADVENTURE YOU ARE ON IS NOT ESTEEMED BY MEN OF COURAGE LIKE YOURSELF. MEANWHILE I ALSO WAS LOOKING BLACK AS THUNDER AND EACH OF US HAD CHANGED COLOUR
MONSIGNOR SEND ME TO THE GALLEYS WHEN IVE DONE DEEDS WORTHY OF THEM
HE SHOWED MY LITTLE VASES TO SEVERAL PERSONS OF QUALITY
SO THAT WHAT WITH HIS LUDICROUS MILANESE JARGON AND HIS SILLY WAY OF TALKING HE GAVE US SO MUCH MATTER FOR MIRTH THAT INSTEAD OF BEMOANING OUR ILL-LUCK WE COULD NOT HOLD FROM LAUGHING AT EVERY WORD HE UTTERED
THE FELLOW LIVED IN A HOUSE NEAR A PLACE CALLED TORRE SANGUIGUA NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING OF ONE OF THE MOST FASHIONABLE COURTESANS IN ROME NAMED SIGNORA ANTEA
AND CERTAIN REMNANTS OF THE COLOSSEUM AND THE BATHS CAN YET BE TRACED
FELICITA AND HIS EXCELLENCY WAS PROCEEDING TO THE PALACE
THE THOUGHT CONSOLES ME THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN; AND QUITTING THEIR PRESENCE HE CAME TO VISIT ME TOGETHER WITH A YOUNG MAN OF MY OWN AGE CALLED PIERRO DI GIOVANNI LANDI-WE LOVED ONE ANOTHER AS THOUGH WE HAD BEEN BROTHERS
WHEN THE CASTELLAN RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE HE SENT TO CHEER ME UP AND FURNISHED ME WITH WRITING MATERIALS AND WAX AND CERTAIN LITTLE WOODEN INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED IN WORKING WAX ADDING MANY WORDS OF COURTESY WHICH WERE REPORTED BY ONE OF HIS SERVANTS WHO BORE ME GOOD-WILL
AND UPON THIS GROUND WISHING TO SUGGEST THE INTERMINGLEMENT OF LAND AND OCEAN I MODELLED TWO FIGURES CONSIDERABLY TALLER THAN A PALM IN HEIGHT WHICH WERE SEATED WITH THEIR LEGS INTERLACED SUGGESTING THOSE LENGTHIER BRANCHES OF THE SEA WHICH RUN UP INTO THE CONTINENTS
GO WHERE YOU CHOOSE
I AM AT YOUR DISPOSAL HERE TO DO WHATEVER YOU SHALL ORDER. THEN I SAID
YET MY PERSEUS BEING ALL BUT FINISHED I DID NOT LIKE TO LEAVE WITHOUT EXPOSING IT TO PUBLIC VIEW
V MY FATHER BEGAN TEACHING ME TO PLAY UPON THE FLUTE AND SING BY NOTE
WE DISMOUNTED AT THE HOUSE OF MY POOR SISTER WHO TOGETHER WITH HER HUSBAND OVERWHELMED US WITH KIND ATTENTIONS
BUT IF THOU WILT GRANT ME TO BEHOLD IT WITH THESE MORTAL EYES OF MINE I ENGAGE MYSELF TO COME AND VISIT THEE AT THY HOLY SEPULCHRE. THIS VOW AND THESE MY GREATEST PRAYERS TO GOD I MADE UPON THE 2ND OF OCTOBER IN THE YEAR 1539
AT PRESENT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TREAT THE CASE WITH OTHER REMEDIES
LIV BEING NOW INFLAMED WITH A GREAT DESIRE TO BEGIN WORKING I TOLD HIS EXCELLENCY THAT I HAD NEED OF A HOUSE WHERE I COULD INSTALL MYSELF AND ERECT FURNACES IN ORDER TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN CLAY AND BRONZE AND ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SEPARATE REQUIREMENTS IN GOLD AND SILVER
IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT BINDO WAS STANDING AT HIS DOOR WHEN MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI THE SCULPTOR PASSED BY
AND IN A FEW DAYS HE SHOULD HEAR WHERE I WAS
FOR IF HE DOES HE SHALL BE PAID THE VALUE FIXED ON IT BY MEN OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS ART
THIS IS PROBABLY THE PRECIOUS MODEL NOW EXISTING IN THE BARGELLO PALACE AT FLORENCE IN MANY POINTS MORE INTERESTING THAN THE COMPLETED BRONZE STATUE UNDER THE LOGGIA DE LANZI
ILL TELL THEE A GREAT MARVEL
1 AT THE UTMOST HAZARD OF OUR LIVES WE SUCCEEDED IN SURMOUNTING THOSE TWO ALPINE RIDGES
HE GAVE ME ORDERS AT ONCE TO STRIKE DIES FOR HIS COINAGE
HE WAS A GREAT JURIST
NOW IT PLEASED GOD THAT ON THE INSTANT OF ITS EXPOSURE TO VIEW A SHOUT OF BOUNDLESS ENTHUSIASM WENT UP IN COMMENDATION OF MY WORK WHICH CONSOLED ME NOT A LITTLE
THEY ARGUED THAT ACCORDING TO MY METHOD NO SUCCESS COULD BE EXPECTED AND IT WAS A PITY TO WASTE SUCH FINE MODELS
AFTERWARDS I SENT HIM AWAY HAVING ALMOST CERTAIN HOPE OF MY RECOVERY
ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRESENT TIME WHEN ALL MENS THOUGHTS ARE OCCUPIED WITH WAR AND NOT WITH THE BAGATELLES OF OUR PROFESSION. I REPLIED THAT I HAD BROUGHT MONEY ENOUGH TO TAKE ME BACK TO ROME AS I HAD COME TO PARIS AND THAT THIS WAS NOT THE PROPER RETURN FOR THE PAINS I HAD ENDURED FOR HIM AND THAT NOW I BEGAN TO BELIEVE WHAT MAESTRO ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO SAID OF HIM
ACCORDINGLY DEAR BROTHER I ENTREAT YOU TO BE MY HELPER
ALL THE REST OF THEIR BODY FROM THE MIDDLE BACKWARDS RESEMBLED A FISH AND THE TAILS OF THESE CREATURES WERE AGREEABLY INTER-WOVEN
TELL HIM TO WAIT. ON HEARING THIS I CLOTHED MYSELF WITH PATIENCE WHICH OF ALL THINGS I FIND THE MOST DIFFICULT
WHEREUPON MESSER LUIGI TOLD HIS MAJESTY SO MUCH ABOUT MY PERSONAL QUALITIES AS WELL AS MY ART AND SPOKE SO FAVOURABLY THAT THE KING EXPRESSED A WISH TO KNOW ME
THROUGH THE GAP THUS MADE I CREPT INTO THE TOWN
WHILE FROM THE GARDEN SUCH A STORM OF WIND AND RAIN KEPT BLOWING IN THAT IT PERCEPTIBLY COOLED THE FURNACE
HAVE YOU COME TO WORK OUT THE TIME YOU PROMISED ME? HE ANSWERED YES AND THAT HE MEANT NEVER TO LEAVE ME
HE SAT AMONG THE FORTY-EIGHT SENATORS OF ALESSANDRO AND WAS MADE A CARDINAL BY PAUL III
THE MAN WHO CAME HAD THE TITLE AND BEHAVIOUR OF A CATCH-POLL
THE DUKE WHO CERTAINLY WAS AT ALL TIMES A MAN OF GREAT ABILITY WENT ROUND THE CITY HIMSELF UPON A TOUR OF INSPECTION AND WHEN HE HAD MADE HIS MIND UP HE SENT FOR LATTANZIO GORINI ONE OF HIS PAYMASTERS
WAS IT NOT YOUR BUSINESS BEFORE YOU TOOK ME UP TO FIND OUT WHAT I HAD DONE WITH THOSE EIGHTY THOUSAND DUCATS
TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN? WHILE FELICE WAS CUDGELLING AND SHE SCREAMING I WAS IN A DREAM
HOWEVER I DO NOT CARE TO IMITATE HIS MASTER BANDINELLO WHO ALWAYS WANDERED FROM THE SUBJECT IN HIS TALK
SO THEY SENTENCED ME TO PAY FOUR MEASURES OF FLOUR WHICH WERE TO BE GIVEN AS ALMS TO THE NUNNERY OF THE MURATE
CERTAINLY THE POPE HAD NO UNWILLINGNESS TO RELEASE ME THEN
I KISSED HIS HANDS
BUT PERCEIVING THAT THEY CAME TO NOTHING HE GAVE UP HIS ATTEMPT AS DESPERATE AND SPOKE IN SOMEWHAT MILDER TONES AFTER THIS WISE
LXI AFTER THE LAPSE OF THREE DAYS ON A THURSDAY THERE CAME TO ME TWO FAVOURITE CHAMBERLAINS OF HIS HOLINESS
ACCORDINGLY I DISMISSED MY WORK PEOPLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TWO ITALIANS WHOM I SET TO MAKING TWO BIG VASES OUT OF MY OWN SILVER
MANY JOURNEYMEN WERE NOW IN MY EMPLOY
IF THEN YOU ARE CONTENTED WITH THAT YOUR SALARY IS SETTLED. I AGREED UPON THESE TERMS ADDING THAT WHAT I MIGHT EARN IN ADDITION BY THE MERIT OF MY PERFORMANCES COULD BE GIVEN AFTER THEY WERE SEEN
1 YOUR HOLINESS WILL REMEMBER HOW THE MALICIOUS AND LYING TONGUE OF MY BITTER ENEMY SO EASILY AROUSED YOUR ANGER THAT YOU ORDERED THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE ME TAKEN ON THE SPOT AND HANGED
THE PIECE ITSELF IS MINE AND WITH IT I SHALL DO WHAT I THINK BEST. POMPEO RAN OFF TO REPORT MY SPEECH TOGETHER WITH SOME BITING WORDS WHICH IN MY RIGHTEOUS ANGER I HAD LET FLY AT HIMSELF
THEY TOLD ME THIS AT TWENTY
WITH CAUSE OR WITHOUT CAUSE SEE YOU NEVER STRIKE ANY ONE OF MY FAMILY OR ELSE ILL MAKE YOU FEEL HOW I CAN STRIKE MYSELF. HE BANDIED WORDS WITH ME WHICH MADE ME JUMP ON HIM AND GIVE HIM THE SEVEREST DRUBBING WITH BOTH FISTS AND FEET THAT HE HAD EVER FELT
ACCORDINGLY UPON THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL WITHOUT SOLICITATION UPON MY PART HE CAME OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO MY HOUSE
HE FOR HIS PART UNDERTOOK TO DO THE TALKING AND PROMISED TO SETTLE THE MATTER TO THEIR HONOUR
SO THEN YOU DO NOT LIKE ME TO ACT AS THE ATTORNEY OF YOUR EXCELLENCIES AND TO DO MY UTMOST TO ENSURE YOUR BEING BETTER SERVED
WE HAD BEEN SPEAKING FOR A LONG WHILE WHEN THE DUKE WHO WAS IN A ROOM ADJACENT HEARD MY VOICE AND CONDESCENDED VERY GRACIOUSLY TO SEND FOR ME
ALMS ID THEN BESTOW MORN AFTER MORN ON BLIND FOLK LAME AND POOR
1 SO THEY HAD HIM REMOVED FROM THAT POST
ONLY I ENTREATED HIM TO TAKE THE KEYS I GAVE HIM AND TO RETURN THE GEMS AND GOLD IN MY DRAWERS TO SUCH AND SUCH PERSONS WHOSE NAMES HE WOULD FIND INSCRIBED UPON MY MEMORANDUM-BOOK
YET ALL THESE ENDEAVOURS WERE APPARENTLY INSUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THE OBSTINACY OF MY MALADY SO THAT THE PHYSICIANS WERE IN DESPAIR AND AT THEIR WITS ENDS WHAT TO DO
2 NOW OAK-WOOD OF THAT KIND HEATS MORE POWERFULLY THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF TREE
JUST THEN I MET WITH FEDERIGO GINORI A YOUNG MAN OF A VERY LOFTY SPIRIT
NOW I HAD RESOLVED IN THE HEAT OF MY DESPAIR IF I MET BANDINELLO WHO WENT EVERY EVENING TO A FARM OF HIS ABOVE SAN DOMENICO THAT I WOULD HURL HIM TO DESTRUCTION
SO MICHEL AGNOLO STOOD UP AND SAID IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO KISS THE FEET OF THE POPE AND THE CHEEKS OF ANGELS
THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO SAVE WERE HIS WRITINGS WORTH MANY SCORES OF CROWNS
HE BEGAN TO ASK ME WHAT I WAS ENGAGED UPON AND TOLD ME TO GO ON WORKING
I THEREFORE BEING A MAN AND NOT A MONK WAS NOT GOING TO BREAK THE SIMPLE AND LOYAL WORD WHICH I HAD GIVEN
CONSEQUENTLY AFTER HAVING KEPT ME EIGHT WHOLE DAYS IN PRISON THEY SENT ME UP FOR EXAMINATION IN ORDER TO PUT AN END IF POSSIBLE TO THE AFFAIR
LET US GO TO SEE THIS MAN WHO WORKS MIRACLES. SO WHEN HE DEPARTED THEY STAYED BY ME AND ONE MADE ME OFFERS OF KINDNESS AND ANOTHER MADE ME PRESENTS
I HAVE FASTED SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING UP TO THE PRESENT MOMENT AT THE DOOR OF MADAME DETAMPES
I MUST SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BOYS FIGURE SO EXCELLENTLY WROUGHT AND IN SO FINE A STYLE AMONG ALL THE ANTIQUES I HAVE INSPECTED
AND THOUGH SHE DECLARED SHE WAS MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME I REMAINED STEADFAST IN MY LOYALTY
I SAID THAT I SHOULD MUCH LIKE TO DO SO AND BEGAN BEFORE HER EYES TO MAKE A LITTLE SKETCH FOR IT WORKING ALL THE BETTER BECAUSE OF THE PLEASURE I TOOK IN CONVERSING WITH SO LOVELY AND AGREEABLE A GENTLEWOMAN
SINCE THE CARDINAL HAD MADE HIM NO PROVISION WE MUST DO SO AND ALL THE MORE BECAUSE THE MAN HIMSELF IS SO SLOW AT ASKING FAVOURS--TO CUT IT SHORT I MEAN TO HAVE HIM WELL PROVIDED FOR
HE WAS GOING A FEW PACES BEFORE THE COURIER BUSBACCA TO WHOM ASCANIO HAD GIVEN HIS LANCE TO CARRY FOR HIM
MARIA DEL FIORE
CELLINI CALLS THIS MAN HIS BITTER FOE AND RIVAL BUACCIO OR THE GREAT OX BLOCKHEAD INSTEAD OF BACCIO WHICH IS SHORTENED FOR BARTOLOMMEO
AFTERWARDS HE APPOINTED MY FRIEND VINCENZIO TO THE ORDERING OF THE PERFUMES AND THE FIRE AND WITH HIM AGNOLINO GADDI
I WOULD BIND MYSELF BY CONTRACT TO RECEIVE NO REMUNERATION UNLESS I PRODUCED SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE FINEST OF THE BAPTISTERY DOORS
THOSE MEN THERE HAVE FOUND THE RIGHT WAY TO BRING SHAME UPON THEMSELVES! A CROWD OF GREAT LORDS PRESSING ROUND THE POPE POINTED OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY MODEL AND THE DRAWINGS
HOWEVER WHEN THE RIDERS APPROACHED I FOUND THEY WERE A MESSENGER FROM THE KING AND MY LAD ASCANIO
AND EVER AS THE EARTH GREW HIGHER I INTRODUCED ITS PROPER AIR-VENTS WHICH WERE LITTLE TUBES OF EARTHENWARE SUCH AS FOLK USE FOR DRAINS AND SUCH-LIKE PURPOSES
AS TO WHETHER HE WAS A MAN OF TRUTH THERE IS STILL DISPUTE AMONG SCHOLARS
IN TAVOLA A FACCETTE AND IN PUNTA THE WORD I HAVE TRANSLATED CROPPED IS ISCHERICATO WHICH WAS PROPERLY APPLIED TO AN UNFROCKED OR DEGRADED ECCLESIASTIC
2 OTHER BASTIONS AND GATES WERE ASSIGNED TO DIVERS ENGINEERS WHOSE NAMES I DO NOT RECOLLECT NOR INDEED AM I CONCERNED WITH THEM
AND THOUGH THE JOB COST ME SOME TROUBLE I ENJOYED IT
I HAD INDEED BEEN WORRIED INTO DOING SO BY A CERTAIN MILANESE CALLED PAGOLO ARSAGO
OF SUCH PIECES I MADE VERY MANY AND FOUND THEM EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO WORK
BUT ABOUT A MILE FARTHER ON WE CAME UPON A SCENE OF DEVASTATION WHICH SURPASSED WHAT WE HAD SUFFERED AND DEFIES DESCRIPTION
FOR I HAD LAID THE WAX ON AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD COME OUT IN BRONZE AS PERFECTLY AS THE MEDUSA
SHE IMAGINED I HAD DISCLOSED THOSE PARTS OF THE STATUE TO INSULT HER
UPON THIS THE POPE LAUGHED ALOUD
WHEN I WAS ALONE I BEGAN TO SING A DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI A MISERERE AND IN TE DOMINE SPERAVI DURING THE WHOLE OF THAT FIRST DAY OF AUGUST I KEPT FESTIVAL WITH GOD MY HEART REJOICING EVER IN THE STRENGTH OF HOPE AND FAITH
PRINCES WHO PUT HEART AND COURAGE IN THEIR SERVANTS AS YOUR MAJESTY DOES BY DEED AND WORD RENDER UNDERTAKINGS OF THE GREATEST MAGNITUDE QUITE EASY
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT MY FATHER APPEARED TO ME IN A DREAM AND BEGGED ME WITH TEARS OF TENDEREST AFFECTION FOR GODS LOVE AND HIS TO ENTER UPON THIS ENGAGEMENT
SO BEWARE AND KEEP A QUIET TONGUE IN YOUR HEADS. TO HIM I SAID IN ITALIAN
YOU LAZY LUBBERS IF YOU DONT PACK OFF FROM THERE AND IF BUT A MANS CHILD AMONG YOU DARES TO TOUCH THE STAIRCASE I HAVE GOT TWO CANNON LOADED WHICH WILL BLOW YOU INTO POWDER
THIS WAS IN 1512 WHEN LORENZOS TWO SONS GIULIANO AND GIOVANNI AFTERWARDS POPE LEO X CAME BACK THROUGH THE AID OF A SPANISH ARMY AFTER THE GREAT BATTLE AT RAVENNA
DONATELLOS JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES
AND WHILE I GAZED IN ECSTASY I SHOUTED
O BLESSED JESUS
SO THEN TAKING THE THING RATHER ILL THAN OTHERWISE HE SHOT A FURIOUS GLANCE UPON ME AND CRIED HAUGHTILY
WOULD TO GOD THAT YOU HAD KILLED THOSE TWO RASCALS
AND THIS I DID WITH THE FULLEST SATISFACTION SEEING THEY EXACTLY SUITED MY OWN FANCY
AND WHEN I NOTICED THAT MINE PLEASED HIM FAR BETTER I DREW FORTH FROM MY BOSOM A PATIENT 2 IN WHICH I PRAYED FOR THE POST OF STAMP-MASTER 3 IN THE MINT
WHEN THEREFORE I CHANCED TO MEET A WATER-CARRIER DRIVING HIS DONKEY LADEN WITH FULL BUCKETS I CALLED THE FELLOW AND BEGGED HIM TO CARRY ME UPON HIS BACK TO THE TERRACE BY THE STEPS OF SAN PIERO ADDING
WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE THAT WORTHLESS VILLAIN WAS I FOUND THE DOOR AJAR AND ENTERED
2 CONSEQUENTLY WHILE I WAS PRESSING MICHEL AGNOLO WITH ARGUMENTS HE COULD NOT ANSWER HE TURNED ROUND SHARPLY TO URBINO AS THOUGH TO ASK HIM HIS OPINION
AND SEEING THAT HE DID NOT ANSWER I TOOK MY WAY TOWARD THE GATE OF ROME
E ASS-OX ANE-ET-BO NOTE 3
YET I MADE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY AND BORE MY ADVERSE FORTUNE WITH AS LIGHT A HEART AS I WAS ABLE
THE HORSE HAD NOT GONE MANY PACES WHEN I MET THEM RIDING TOWARD ME AND ASKED IF THEY WERE HURT
I WHO INCLINE TO THE GOOD ONLY DISCERN THE TRUTH WITH PURER SENSE
ON THIS THE FELLOW CRAVED FOR MERCY PROMISING TO GIVE BACK WHATEVER HE POSSESSED OF MINE
THEY DELIBERATED ON THE MATTER AND CHARGED MICHELE WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
THE POPE FELT SOME SHAME AND GAVE ORDERS THAT ALL THE RECORDS OF THE JEWELS SHOULD BE DILIGENTLY SEARCHED
IT CHANCED THAT A LIGHT-BRAINED SWAGGERING YOUNG FELLOW PASSED BY
SO I COMPOSED FOUR VERSES AND STUCK THEM UP IN AN ANGLE OF THE CHURCH WHERE PEOPLE GO TO EASE THEMSELVES
BUT AT LAST I PRESENTED MYSELF ONE EVENING AND OFFERED THE TWO VASES FOR THE KINGS INSPECTION
I ALSO FOUND ROOM FOR SOME ENAMELLED FRUITS AND CONNECTING LINKS SO THAT THE STONE AND SETTING WENT UNCOMMONLY WELL TOGETHER
YOU MUST KNOW MY LORD THAT THE NATURE OF FIRE IS TO ASCEND AND THEREFORE I PROMISE YOU THAT MEDUSAS HEAD WILL COME OUT FAMOUSLY
THOUGH SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS SIGNED TO GIOVANNI NOT TO TELL CECCHINO HE CRIED OUT LIKE A MADMAN HOW IT WAS THAT BERTINO ALDOBRANDI HAD BEEN KILLED BY THE GUARD
BUT WE HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THAT FRENCH JUDGES USED THE SAME IMPRECATIONS WHEN INTERRUPTED IN THE THIRTEENTH AS THEY DID IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY OR THAT WHAT CELLINI HEARD ON THIS OCCASION WAS MORE THAN AN ACCIDENTAL SIMILARITY OF SOUNDS STRIKING HIS QUICK EAR AND AWAKENING HIS LIVELY MEMORY
IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO DESCRIBE THAT LITTLE JOURNEY IN DETAIL
IN THE PRESENT COURT SBIETTA WOULD NOT HAVE A FEDERIGO DE RICCI TO SUPPORT HIM A MAN WILLING FOR THE BRIBE OF A COUPLE OF FATTED KIDS WITHOUT RESPECT OF GOD OR OF HIS HONOUR TO BACK SO INFAMOUS A CAUSE AND DO SO VILE A WRONG TO SACRED JUSTICE
SO THAT OUR COMPANY OF ARTISTS WAS WELL-NIGH ALTOGETHER BROKEN UP
MANCARE DI UNA SìPAZZA COSA THE PAZZA COSA MAY BE THE SUPPER-PARTY OR THE CORNACCHIA NOTE 4
LET THE WORLD THEN TAKE NOTICE WHEN FORTUNE HAS THE WILL TO RUIN A MAN HOW MANY DIVERS WAYS SHE TAKES
1 ADDING THAT IF WE PUT UP AT HIS INN HE WOULD TREAT US MOST KINDLY FOR THE REASON THAT WE BOTH WERE FLORENTINES
THEREUPON ONE OF THOSE RADICAL FELLOWS SHAKING THE CREST OF HIS TWISTED HOOD STOOD UP AND ADDRESSED MY FATHER WITH THESE INSULTING WORDS
ACCORDINGLY I WAS FORCED TO YIELD WITH THE BEST GRACE I COULD
SIGNOR PIER LUIGI FELT ALSO THAT HE HAD ACTED ILL
FINDING THAT THE REMEDIES OF HIS PHYSICIANS AVAILED NOTHING IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO GOD AND THEREFORE DECREED THE DISCHARGE OF ALL DEBTS TO HIS SERVANTS
WHEN HE GOT AT HIM HE TORE THE CAPE OFF HIS BACK
WHEN THE LONGED-FOR DAY ARRIVED I BETOOK ME TO THE PALACE
THIS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY SO THAT MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE FACT
THEREAT I PRESENTED MY ARMS BOLDLY CALLING ALOUD
THE GUIDE SHOUTED IN GERMAN THAT IF THE FOLK OF THOSE PARTS SAW ME THEY WOULD PUT ME TO DEATH
THOUGH HE PRAISED THEM BOTH HE SAID THAT ONE OF THEM PLEASED HIM BETTER THAN THE OTHER
BENVENUTO DESERVES TO BE MADE MUCH OF FOR HIS PERFORMANCES DO NOT MERELY RIVAL BUT SURPASS THE ANTIQUE. IN REPLY TO THIS MADAME DETAMPES OBSERVED THAT MY JUPITER WOULD NOT MAKE ANYTHING LIKE SO FINE A SHOW BY DAYLIGHT
LIX THE DUCHESS ALSO TREATED ME WITH EXTRAORDINARY GRACIOUSNESS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN PLEASED IF I HAD WORKED FOR HER ALONE FORGETTING PERSEUS AND EVERYTHING BESIDES
LET GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT
AND I BELIEVE THE REASON OF THIS IS THAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY LENDS TOO READY AN EAR TO MY CALUMNIATORS OR ELSE INDEED THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY ART. HE HARDLY LET ME CLOSE THE SENTENCE WHEN HE BROKE IN
FOR CELLINIS USE OF TRIBULARE OR TRIBOLARE SEE LIB
I AM THE LEAST OF ALL ITALIANS IN ITALY AND YET I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO YOU IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT I HAVE THE HEART TO DO AND WILL DO IF YOU UTTER A SINGLE FURTHER WORD, ADDING OTHER TERMS OF MENACE AND ABUSE
WE GIVE UP TO YOU THIS PRISONER
2 THESE ARE THE TRUE ARMS OF THE CELLINI
AT THE END OF THIS TIME GIOVANNIS WIFE MISCARRIED OF TWO BOYS THROUGH THE UNSKILFULNESS OF THE DOCTORS
INNOCENZIO CIBO MALASPINA ARCHBISHOP OF GENOA AND NEPHEW OF LORENZO DE MEDICI
O GENTLE SPRITE
THIS WORD ABOUT THE PRISON WHEN I REMEMBERED WHAT I HAD ENDURED IN ROME STRUCK SUCH TERROR INTO ME THAT I WHEELED MY HORSE ROUND BRISKLY AND FOLLOWED THE KINGS MESSENGER
AND I COMMANDED HER TO EXPLAIN PRECISELY HOW I HAD CONSORTED WITH HER
FOR I SHALL EASILY BE ABLE TO MEND WHAT IS LACKING
THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE FEAST OF OUR SAN GIOVANNI ONE OR TWO DAYS BEFORE
BENVENUTO BENVENUTO YOU ARE GOING ABOUT TO MAKE ME TREAT YOU AS YOU DESERVE. YOU WILL TREAT ME WITH HONOUR AND COURTESY IF YOU WISH TO ACT AS I DESERVE. TAKING ME UP AGAIN HE CRIED
GIVE ORDERS
MY BENVENUTO I SHOULD LIKE TO RECONCILE YOU WITH PIERMARIA SBIETTA. I REPLIED THAT NOBODY COULD SETTLE THE AFFAIRS BETWEEN US EXCEPT THE LORDS COUNSELLORS
BUT THE POPE PERCEIVING THEIR DRIFT SCOLDED THEM AND INSISTED THAT I SHOULD GO ON WORKING
THIS CAPTAIN WAS A SPANIARD WHO PLAYED A VERY CONSIDERABLE FIGURE IN THE WAR DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF AT THE CAPTURE OF GENOA AND THE BATTLE OF LODI IN 1522 AND AFTERWARDS ACTING AS LIEUTENANT-GENERAL TO THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
44 GIVES TO THIS MAN THE CHARACTER OF A PRESUMPTUOUS CONCEITED SIMPLETON
WHAT HE WANTED WAS TO BRAG BEFORE THE GOVERNOR OF HAVING IN HIS YOUTH BEEN SPIRITED AND BRAVE
THEN ON THE STONE I SAW STRANGE LUSTRE SHINE
ASCANIO MEANWHILE HAD GONE TO FIND HIS FATHER WHO HAD COME TO ROME FROM TAGLIACOZZO HIS BIRTHPLACE
AND I TOO HERE IN MY OWN BIRTHPLACE FAMOUS AS THE SCHOOL OF EVERY ART AND SCIENCE
ON THE ROAD THIS MAN NEVER STOPPED ASKING ME WHAT I MEANT TO DO WITH MYSELF AND WHAT MY OWN TERMS REGARDING THE APPOINTMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN
HE WAS CALLED GIANFRANCESCO AND WAS A BANDSMAN BUT WAS FAR MORE NATURALLY GIVEN TO MEDICINE THAN TO MUSIC
THE BOY HAD STUCK HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES EXCLAIMING
THEREUPON I SAID THAT WHAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR HER WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR ME
BUT RAIN HAD FALLEN SCORES OF YEARS UPON THE STONE FILTERING SO DEEPLY FROM THE HOLES INTO ITS SUBSTANCE THAT THE MARBLE WAS DECAYED
JACOPO CARRUCCI DA PANTORMO WAS NOW AN OLD MAN
FOR HIM CONSULT CELLINIS OREFICERIA XXVII AT THAT TIME WHILE I WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY-THREE THERE RAGED A PLAGUE OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY VIOLENCE THAT MANY THOUSANDS DIED OF IT EVERY DAY IN ROME
HE WAS THE CHIEF AMONG THE ROMAN GOLDSMITHS AND HAD BEEN FIRENZUOLAS MASTER
3 IF I SPEAK OUT IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY WORTHY FELLOWS AS ARE HERE IT IS BECAUSE I DO NOT WISH YOUR EXCELLENCY TO BELIEVE WHAT BERNARDONE TELLS YOU. WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
ON BEHOLDING THE BOATS UPON THAT LAKE I TOOK FRIGHT
THEREFORE I HAD TO ACCEPT THE THREE HORSES AND WITH THEM WE BEGAN OUR JOURNEY
I SHALL YET MAKE YOU A MARVELLOUS MUSICIAN AGAINST THE WILL OF ALL OR ANY ONE WHO MAY DESIRE TO PREVENT ME. TO THIS PIERO ANSWERED AND SPOKE THE TRUTH
AND BENVENUTOS SHOES ARE WORTH MORE THAN THE EYES OF ALL THOSE OTHER BLOCKHEADS. SO HAVING THANKED HIS HOLINESS I WENT BACK REJOICING ABOVE MEASURE TO MY WORK
BUT I HATED HIS DIRTY VICES AND FRANKLY TAXED HIM WITH THEM
I TOOK MUCH PLEASURE IN MUSIC AND AMUSEMENTS OF THE KIND
I USED TO PLAY TREBLE IN CONCERT WITH THE MUSICIANS OF THE PALACE BEFORE THE SIGNORY FOLLOWING MY NOTES
THEY ARE NOT PEARLS OF THE QUALITY AND GOODNESS YOU AFFIRM
AND THESE EXCELLENT RELATIONS CONTINUED BETWEEN US UNTIL THE PLANS WHICH HE AND HIS BROTHER SER FILIPPO HAD IN MIND WERE FULLY MATURED
ALTHOUGH I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD ADD A TRIFLE TO MY LABOUR I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED BECAUSE I COULD NOW PROVE TO THE DUKE HOW WELL I UNDERSTOOD MY BUSINESS
BUT WHEN I SAW THAT SHE WAS DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT PLACE THEM ON THE PEDESTAL WHERE THEY NOW STAND I WAITED TILL NEXT DAY AND WENT TO THE PALACE ABOUT TWENTY-TWO OCLOCK
HE SAVED HIS REGISTRAR FROM THE GALLOWS AND GAVE ME THE SAME FREEDOM AS I HAD BEFORE
FOR THE GRANT OF THE CASTLE SEE IBID P
IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY OWN AFFAIRS
THIS KINDLY GENTLEMAN TOOK BACK MY MESSAGE TO THE DUKE WHO CAME WITH PLEASURE
HE FURTHER REMINDED ME THAT LAWSUITS HAD A CERTAIN WAY OF DRAGGING ON AND THAT I COULD EMPLOY THE TIME FAR BETTER UPON SOME MASTERPIECE OF ART WHICH WOULD BRING ME NOT ONLY GREATER HONOUR BUT GREATER PROFIT TO BOOT
MY LORDS IF I WERE TO GIVE THE WORK TO HIS HOLINESS I SHOULD BE GIVING WHAT IS MINE AND NOT HIS AND AT PRESENT I HAVE NO INTENTION TO MAKE HIM THIS GIFT
ONE OF THE ROOMS IN THE PALAZZO VECCHIO SO CALLED BECAUSE THE FAMOUS COSMOGRAPHICAL TIMEPIECE MADE ABOUT 1484 FOR LORENZO DE MEDICI BY LORENZO DELLA VOLPAIA STOOD THERE
YOUVE NO CLOAK OR SHAWL
TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON WE ALL SAT DOWN TO SUPPER IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS
MY LORD IF YOU WILL UNDERTAKE TO PAY SOME WORKPEOPLE I AM READY TO STRIKE COINS FOR YOUR MINT AND MEDALS WITH YOUR PORTRAIT
I AM QUITE WILLING TO TELL YOU IF BEING THE MAN OF WORTH I TAKE YOU FOR YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO SAY THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU. I GAVE THE PROMISE AND HE PROCEEDED
AFTER WAITING SOME TIME I GREW TIRED AND MY HEAT COOLED
WHEN I WAS AWARE OF THIS I USED TO PULL ONE OUT AS THOUGH IT WERE A WEAPON FROM A SCABBARD WITHOUT ANY PAIN OR LOSS OF BLOOD
HE GRANTED IT IN MOST OBLIGING TERMS AND BADE ME RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO COMPLETE HIS PERSEUS
I WOULD LEAVE THE SEVEN MONTHS OF MY SALARY WHICH WERE DUE AND HIS MAJESTY MIGHT CONDESCEND TO PAY ME WHEN I REQUIRED MONEY FOR MY RETURN JOURNEY
IT SEEMS THAT THE LAST WORDS SPOKEN FROM THE KING BY MONSIGNOR DI MORLUC HAD BEEN TO THIS EFFECT NAMELY THAT THE POPE OUGHT TO HAND ME OVER TO THE ORDINARY JUDGES OF THE COURT
HE PROMISED TO DO AS I ASKED
SO THE DOG ABANDONING ALL HOPE OF AID FROM SUCH RASCALS SET OUT ALONE AGAIN ON HIS ADVENTURE
587
THIS MESSAGE WAS REPORTED BY DON DIEGO BUT IT ONLY MADE FRANCESCO LAUGH
IT WAS FROM HIM I STOLE THE PINCERS WHICH I USED IN ORDER TO DRAW OUT THE NAILS FROM THE HOLDFASTS OF THE HINGES
HE WAS A DEVOTED ADHERENT OF THE MEDICI
AT THAT TIME MESSER ALFONSO QUISTELLO WAS STILL ALIVE AND CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
HE WAS GREATLY ANNOYED AND EXCLAIMED
HIS LEFT HAND HELD THE GLOBE OF THE WORLD
THERE MY FATHER RECEIVED HIM MOST AFFECTIONATELY AND LOVINGLY PRAYED HIM UNKNOWN BY ME NOT TO INSIST ON TAKING ME AGAIN TO PISA
THE SEA WAS A MAN AND IN HIS HAND I PLACED A SHIP ELABORATELY WROUGHT IN ALL ITS DETAILS AND WELL ADAPTED TO HOLD A QUANTITY OF SALT
IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLETED WHEN HE DIED
WHEN WE CAME ONCE MORE TO THE PLACE APPOINTED THE NECROMANCER MADE JUST THE SAME PREPARATIONS ATTENDED BY THE SAME AND EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE DETAILS
BUT THE JOB WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN IN HAND IS MORE DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT THAN YOU IMAGINE AND MAY PERADVENTURE TURN OUT THE WRONG WAY FOR YOU
CIPOLLATA LITERALLY A SHOW OF ONIONS AND PUMPKINS
MY LORD I AM COME TO SHOW YOU A MOST SPLENDID NECKLACE OF PEARLS OF THE RAREST QUALITY AND TRULY WORTHY OF YOUR EXCELLENCY
NOW THE DUKE WHO WAS TOO MUCH INCLINED TO CREDIT HIS ASSERTIONS ENCOURAGED THE FELLOW TO SPEAK THUS AND THOUGHT IN HIS OWN HEART THAT THINGS WOULD GO AS HE HAD PROPHESIED BECAUSE THAT ENVIOUS CREATURE BANDINELLO NEVER CEASED INSINUATING MALICE
THIS IS THE REVERSE OF THAT VILE TYRANTS MEDAL WHICH YOUR LORENZINO DE MEDICI PROMISED YOU. THEN HE ADDED
HE RETURNED TO FLORENCE IN 1548
THEN HE WALKED ALL ROUND IT STOPPING AT EACH OF THE FOUR POINTS OF VIEW EXACTLY AS THE RIPEST EXPERT WOULD HAVE DONE
NO SOONER HAD I GOT INSIDE THAN SOME MASTIFF DOGS SET UPON ME AND BIT ME BADLY
WHEN ROSSO SET EYES ON ME HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED SUDDENLY AND HE EXCLAIMED
IF YOU WANT ME ALIVE TOUCH ME AS YOU DID BEFORE AND THREATEN THE OLD MAN FOR HE IS AFRAID OF YOU. AT THESE WORDS SOME OF THE FOLK WERE TERRIFIED KNOWING THAT I WAS NOT RAVING BUT TALKING TO THE PURPOSE AND WITH ALL MY WITS
FOR I CONSIDERED THAT THE SPLENDID FAVOURS OF HIS EXCELLENCY HAD AMPLY RECOMPENSED MY PAINS WHEREAS THAT PALTRY STONE INSULTED THEM
I THEN PROCEEDED TO REMARK THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BROUGHT THE MAGNIFICENT SCHOOL OF FLORENCE TO SUCH A PITCH OF EXCELLENCE ONLY BY STIMULATING COMPETITION AMONG ARTISTS IN THEIR SEVERAL BRANCHES
SO SPLENDID IN THEIR ACTION THAT NOTHING SURVIVES OF ANCIENT OR OF MODERN ART WHICH TOUCHES THE SAME LOFTY POINT OF EXCELLENCE
AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
AT THIS HE FLEW INTO A RAGE AND SAID
NOW AT LAST I KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF HIS HOLINESS AND YOU HIS MINISTERS. WHILE I WAS DELIVERING THIS SPEECH THEY SAT AND LISTENED IN ASTONISHMENT
AND ON RECEIVING THE PERMISSION HE ERECTED HIS PIETà WITH GREAT HASTE
PRESENTING HIMSELF TO THE CARDINAL HE RELATED HOW CARDINAL DE MEDICI HAD SENT FOR BENVENUTO AND WANTED TO BE HIS PROTECTOR
HAVE NO FEAR
BUT AS REGARDS MY DELIVERANCE FROM THIS DUNGEON THE DAY WILL NOT END BEFORE YOU COME TO FETCH ME OUT
THAT I TOO HAD FARED ACCORDING TO THE WONT OF THAT APPALLING SEASON, I
YOU MAY RECKON ON NEVER HAVING ANY DISPUTES WITH ME. WHILE WE WERE THUS TALKING I NOTICED THAT HE LOOKED ME HARD IN THE FACE WHICH COMPELLED ME TO ADDRESS HIM THUS
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKES TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID
CARDINAL ORSINI WAS ABSOLUTELY FOR HAVING ME HANGED OR PUT TO DEATH
UPON THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHICH WAS THE 3RD OF OCTOBER I WOKE AT DAYBREAK PERHAPS AN HOUR BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN
THE PAYMENTS HAD ALWAYS BEEN MADE THROUGH TWO NOTARIES AND ONE OF HIS MAJESTYS TREASURERS
AND IF THE MATERIAL HAD BEEN ANYTHING BUT GOLD I COULD VERY EASILY HAVE DONE SO MYSELF
ASCANIO MEANWHILE ESCAPED TO TAGLIACOZZO TO HIS HOME THERE WHENCE HE WROTE BEGGING A THOUSAND TIMES MY PARDON AND ACKNOWLEDGING HIS WRONG IN ADDING TROUBLES TO MY GRAVE DISASTER
COUNTING PAGOLO AND ASCANIO AND A SERVANT WE WERE FOUR MEN WITH FOUR VERY GOOD HORSES
ALSO THAT THOUGH THE TWO LAST FINGERS MUST REMAIN SOMEWHAT WEAKER THAN THE OTHERS THIS WOULD BE OF NO INCONVENIENCE AT ALL TO HER
NEVERTHELESS HE RECEIVED ME WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS AND WISHED TO INSPECT THE MEDALS AND THE DIES
THEY ANSWERED
GO THEN AND TELL HIM I INSIST ON HAVING THE MARBLE EVEN AGAINST HIS WILL
TO THIS GIULIO REPLIED
AFTER A FEW WORDS THEY DREW THEIR WEAPONS AND THE FOUR BOYS SO HARRIED THE GUARD THAT IF CAPTAIN CATTIVANZA HAD BUT SHOWN HIS FACE WITHOUT SO MUCH AS DRAWING THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PUT THE WHOLE PACK TO FLIGHT
OREFICERIA CAP
OF A TRUTH THIS IS A MARVELLOUS EXPLOIT. THEN PIER LUIGI BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
ON FURTHER THINKING I RECOLLECTED HOW OFTEN THAT WIFE OF SBIETTA HAD TEASED ME IN A HUNDRED WAYS TO PARTAKE MORE FREELY OF THE SAUCE
AWAY WITH YOU FOR THIS MAN HERE ALONE WAS KILLING YOU! HE ASKED
AND ON THE MOMENT OF MY ARRIVAL THE TWO WOMEN WERE LAUGHING WITH THEIR ADVOCATE
ACCORDINGLY HE PUT THE MATTER INTO THE HANDS OF THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR S
CROSSES TEARS
ME NE FACEVA LA CREDENZA NOTE 3
1 HE ASKED ME WHO I WAS AND WHAT WAS MY PROFESSION
THE SIGHT OF THESE THINGS FILLED ME WITH PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM
HE BORE THE NAME OF DIEGO HAD A HANDSOME FIGURE AND A COMPLEXION OF MARVELLOUS BRILLIANCY
HE DREW THEM AT THE VERY MOMENT THE ALARM IS SOUNDED AND THE MEN ALL NAKED RUN TO ARMS
THIS FELLOW WHEN HE NOTICED MY BOLD FRONT AND THAT I WAS MARCHING ON HIM WITH WEAPON IN HAND QUICKENED HIS PACE AND GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH
ACCORDINGLY I MADE MY MIND UP TO USE A PORTION OF THE SECOND ROLL OF LINEN WHICH I HAD THERE
SINCE I DID THIS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THE GOLD WAS WELL SHUT IN AND I CARRIED IT MORE CONVENIENTLY THAN IF THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN A BAG
AND THEY CONTRIVED THAT A CERTAIN FAVOURITE OF SIGNOR PIER LUIGI THE POPES SON SHOULD ASK HER HAND IN MARRIAGE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS MASTER
PERCEIVING THAT I HAD A LENGTHY PIECE OF BUSINESS ON MY HANDS I SENT FOR A CERTAIN PIETRO PAGOLO FROM MONTE RITONDO IN THE ROMAN DISTRICT WHO HAD BEEN WITH ME FROM HIS BOYHOOD IN ROME
AN IRON SPIKE WHICH WAS IN THE LOCK OF MY MUSKET TORE MY RIGHT HAND
THE WORD IS BOCCHE SO I HAVE TRANSLATED IT BY MOUTHS BUT CELLINI CLEARLY MEANT THE GAPING CLAWS OF THE SCORPION
THE MAGISTRATES HAD ME SUMMONED
AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT A PAINTER WHO WAS INTIMATE WITH MICHEL AGNOLO CALLED GIULIANO BUGIARDINI BROUGHT ME THE DRAWING OF ATLAS
HE SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED THE CAPTAINCY OF THE BANDE NERE AND DIED FIGHTING NEAR NAPLES IN 1528
AND THE DUKE GAVE ORDERS WHILE I WAS AT WORK UPON IT THAT WHENEVER I WENT TO TAKE HIS PORTRAIT I SHOULD BE ADMITTED
AND SO WITHOUT REMOUNTING I RAN HOME LAUGHING TO HAVE COME UNHURT OUT OF AN ACCIDENT ENOUGH TO BREAK MY NECK
FOR I AM SURE TO SEND HER AND HER MOTHER AND HER FELLOW TO THE GALLOWS
WHEN I SAW HIM DETERMINED TO DO SOME ACT OF BESTIAL VIOLENCE I POINTED THE MUZZLE OF MY ARQUEBUSE WITH THE OBJECT ONLY OF KEEPING HIM AT A DISTANCE
VARCHI IN HIS STORIA FLORENTINA LIB
HE WAS CLEMENTS COMMISSARY TO THE PRINCE OF ORANGE DURING THE SIEGE
AND FORASMUCH AS THEY WERE SINGING AND PLAYING FROM THE BOOK MY BEAUTY BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO SING HIS PART
YET IT TURNED OUT THAT I HAD DONE THE WORST FOR MYSELF BECAUSE ALBEIT SHE HAD HARBOURED SOME ANGRY FEELINGS TOWARD ME SHE HAD IN HER A CERTAIN WAY OF DEALING WHICH WAS GENEROUS
I ANSWERED THEM THAT I HAD MADE MY MIND UP QUITE WELL WHAT I WISHED TO DO
PERCHANCE THOULT URGE
BUT THAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAD BEEN IMPOSED AT HIS ELECTION WHICH WOULD HOLD HIM BACK FROM KICKING UP HIS HEELS AT HIS OWN PLEASURE
3 THERE WE SHALL BE IN SAFETY. THE WOUNDED MILANESE GROANED OUT
THEN TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAID
I COULD NOT DRESS MYSELF BUT WHAT THEY TURNED INSIDE OR OUT TO MY GREAT TORMENT
FOR WHEN THE COURT IS COMPLETE IN TIMES OF PEACE THERE ARE SOME 18,000 WHICH MAKES 12,000 LESS THAN THE AVERAGE
THESE WILL BE NEITHER JABBERINGS NOR NONSENSE AS YOU HAVE IT BUT SHALL FORM A CHAIN OF ARGUMENTS TO ANSWER WHICH YOU WILL BE FORCED TO TAX THE UTMOST OF YOUR WITS
AND IT WAS MY INTENTION BEFORE LEAVING FLORENCE TO MAKE SOME ARRANGEMENT FOR ALL OF HIS DAUGHTERS
THEREFORE I REFER MY CAUSE ENTIRELY TO GOD KNOWING THAT HE HATH EVER DEFENDED ME FROM THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO DO ME MISCHIEF
ON ARRIVING THERE THE SIGHT OF THEM FILLED ME WITH SUCH SWEETNESS AND SUCH GLADNESS THAT I WEPT ABUNDANTLY
IT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THOSE MAGISTRATES WHO SENTENCED ME WAS NOW AGAIN A MEMBER OF THE BOARD
AMONG THEM ALL MESSER ANTONIO SANTACROCE LAMENTED GREATLY EXCLAIMING
MEANWHILE I CARRIED MINE TO MADONNA PORZIA WHO LOOKED AT IT WITH ASTONISHMENT AND TOLD ME I HAD FAR SURPASSED MY PROMISE
ACCORDINGLY I FOLLOWED THE COURT
TAKE THY CLOTHES BENVENUTO RISE AND GO
YOU MUST KNOW THAT I HAVE GIVEN OUR SISTER LIPERATA AWAY AGAIN IN MARRIAGE AND SHE HOLDS IT FOR ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE DEAD. ON OUR WAY WE TOLD EACH OTHER ALL THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURES WE HAD MET WITH
ONE DAY ASCANIO TOOK TO BEATING ONE OF OUR LITTLE SHOPBOYS WHO WHEN I CAME HOME FROM OUT OF DOORS COMPLAINED TO ME WITH TEARS THAT ASCANIO HAD KNOCKED HIM ABOUT WITHOUT ANY CAUSE
MOTHER MOTHER HELP ME! THOUGH I HAD COME THERE FULLY DETERMINED TO TAKE HIS LIFE HALF MY FURY EBBED AWAY WHEN I HEARD THIS IDIOTIC EXCLAMATION

THERE WAS IN THE PRESENCE A CERTAIN MESSER TOMMASO OF PRATO HIS HOLINESS DATARY
WHEN I HAD FINISHED THE MEDAL TO MY LIKING AND SHUT IT IN ITS LITTLE BOX I SAID TO THE DUKE
I CONSENTED TO EVERYTHING SENT FOR THE VELVET SETTLED ITS PRICE AND PAID FOR IT
SO LET ME HAVE AUTHORITY TO GIVE HIM A SOUND RATING AFTER MY OWN FASHION. THE POPE TOLD HIM TO DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH WORDS THOUGH HE WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE MATTERS WORSE
WILL YOU SUFFER THIS FAR MORE SPLENDID BLOCK ALTHOUGH IT BELONGS TO BANDINELLO TO REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THAT MAN WHO CANNOT HELP MANGLING IT INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO SOME ARTIST OF TALENT CAPABLE OF DOING IT FULL JUSTICE
PIER LUIGI FARNESE WAS NOT FORMALLY INVESTED WITH THE DUCHY OF PARMA AND PIACENZA UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1545
AFTERWARDS UPON EXAMINING MY WORK HIS COUNTENANCE CLEARED AND HE BEGAN TO PRAISE ME BEYOND MEASURE SAYING THAT I HAD DONE A VAST AMOUNT IN A SHORT TIME
IT HAPPENED THUS
MICHELANGELO HIMSELF HE KNEW AND ADORED
AND ASSUREDLY I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IF MY FRIENDS HAD NOT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE SEEING I SHOULD LOSE MY MONEY AND PERHAPS ROME TOO A SECOND TIME FORASMUCH AS BLOWS CANNOT BE MEASURED AND THAT WITH THE AGREEMENT I HELD OF HIS I COULD AT ANY MOMENT HAVE HIM TAKEN UP
AND THUS WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE DESCENDED FROM A MAN OF WORTH
I COULD HAVE GOT HIM FIVE THOUSAND CROWNS IN GOLD. ONE DAY WHEN I WENT TO THE PALACE SHE REPEATED THESE SAME WORDS TO ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MESSER ALAMANNO SALVIATI 2 AND LAUGHED AT ME A LITTLE SAYING THAT I DESERVED MY BAD LUCK
I AM SORRY THAT YOU ARE COME SO LATE
WITH MANY OTHER PHRASES OF LIKE TENOR ALL OF WHICH IMPLIED THE PRICE WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED
FOR I WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO YOU WITHOUT FAIL. THE CASTELLAN THEN ADDED SPEAKING TO THE POPE
THAT OF TOBBIA WAS IN THE FORM OF A CANDLESTICK THE HORN BEING STUCK IN IT LIKE A CANDLE AND AT THE BASE OF THE PIECE HE HAD INTRODUCED FOUR LITTLE UNICORNS HEADS OF A VERY POOR DESIGN
I MAY INFORM YOU THAT WE HAVE AGREED WITH THE DUKE OF URBINO THAT HE SHOULD GUARD THE PASS
AND WHEN I HAD MADE ENOUGH IN MY OPINION TO CLEAR THE GREAT HEIGHT OF THE CENTRAL KEEP OF SANT ANGELO I TOLD MY SERVANTS THAT I HAD GIVEN AWAY WHAT I WANTED
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE WORK HE WILL GIVE YOU PLENTY
IT HAPPENED AS WAS NATURAL AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-NINE THAT I HAD TAKEN INTO MY SERVICE A GIRL OF GREAT BEAUTY AND GRACE WHOM I USED AS A MODEL IN MY ART AND WHO WAS ALSO COMPLAISANT OF HER PERSONAL FAVOURS TO ME
THIS FELLOW BENVENUTO GOES ABOUT BOASTING THAT I HAVE PROMISED HIM A PIECE OF MARBLE. I TOOK HIM UP AT ONCE
AND THOUGH MY REMEMBRANCE MAY BE BUT A TRIFLE I DEEMED IT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP HIM ALWAYS IN MY HEART
I RODE AT HER SIDE UPON A PRETTY LITTLE HORSE OF MINE MAKING SIGNS TO MY SERVANT THAT HE SHOULD KEEP SOMEWHAT APART WHICH GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY OF DISCUSSING THINGS THAT ARE NOT SOLD BY THE APOTHECARY
ARE YOU NOT A CHRISTIAN
IF I HAD NOT SEEN FOUR GERMAN GENTLEMEN WITH THEIR FOUR HORSES EMBARKING IN ONE OF THE SAME SORT AS OURS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SET MY FOOT IN IT
YET REASON MADE ITSELF HEARD
HE ALSO PRAYED ME TO INVITE SBIETTAS WIFE TO SIT DOWN WITH US
DIED
BUT SUCH AS YOU SAY IT WAS I MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF IT AND GIVE YOU MY FULL PARDON
QUELLA SUA SMANIA DI PAROLE NOTE 4
ALL THESE THINGS INSPIRED IN ME MORE AWE THAN THE IMPERIAL MAJESTY
I HAD SET SPURS TO MY HORSE AND WHILE HE WAS GALLOPING HAD CHARGED AND GOT MY ARQUEBUSE IN READINESS AGAIN
THIS AFFAIR COST ME SEVERAL SCORES OF CROWNS
THE EMPEROR WAS HEARD TO SAY
AND MY BALL WHEN IT STRUCK HIM BROKE UPON THE BLADE AND ONE COULD SEE THE FELLOW CUT IN TWO FAIR HALVES
YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE OF IT. AFTER I HAD THUS EXPOUNDED THESE CONVINCING ARGUMENTS TOGETHER WITH MANY MORE OF THE SAME KIND WHICH IT WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO SET DOWN HERE THE DUKE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND DEPARTED WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY
AFTERWARDS TAKE COMFORT REPOSE AND RECOVER. I BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING AND RELATED THE WHOLE STORY EXACTLY AS IT HAD HAPPENED GIVING HIM THE MOST MINUTE COUNTERSIGNS DOWN TO THE WATER-CARRIER WHO BORE ME ON HIS BACK
IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD JOB TO KILL THAT GUNNER! UPON THIS I TURNED TWO FALCONETS TOWARD THE STAIRCASE WITH MIND RESOLVED TO LET BLAZE ON THE FIRST MAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO COME UP
REPRESENTATIONS IN HIS FAVOUR AS BEING A MAN OF GREAT ABILITY WERE MADE TO THE CARDINAL WHO SUSPENDED THE EXECUTION OF THE SENTENCE AND WROTE TO THE POPE SAYING THE BEST GOLDSMITH IN THE WORLD HAD COME INTO HIS HANDS SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR COINING FALSE MONEY BUT THAT HE WAS A GOOD SIMPLE FELLOW WHO COULD PLEAD IN HIS EXCUSE THAT HE HAD TAKEN COUNSEL WITH HIS CONFESSOR AND HAD RECEIVED AS HE SAID FROM HIM PERMISSION TO DO THIS
THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE THAT IF I HAD CONSULTED MY OWN PALATE I COULD NOT HAVE WISHED FOR EITHER MORE OR LESS
THAT IS HE FINDS EVERYWHERE IN ITALY THE ARMS OF THE FARNESI
HAVING MADE MY PREPARATIONS I CALCULATED HOW MUCH MONEY I SHOULD NEED FOR CERTAIN AFFAIRS OF MY OWN AND SENT ALL THE REST TO ASSIST MY POOR FATHER
MY GOOD FATHER ANSWERED THE LETTER AT ONCE IN WORDS LIKE THESE
HE OBTAINED THE HAT IN 1492
HOWEVER I MADE STILL GREATER IN MY TRADE OF GOLDSMITH
AND NOTICING THAT THE POPE TALKED OF ME WITH SO MUCH AFFECTION AND WARMTH HE PUT IN HIS WORD
THESE MEN OF QUALITY WHEN THEY COMPARED MY PIECE WITH THAT OF THE FAMOUS CARADOSSO DECLARED THAT MINE WAS BY FAR THE BETTER EXECUTED AND MORE BEAUTIFUL AND BADE ME ASK WHAT I LIKED AS THE REWARD OF MY TROUBLE
1 THE DUKE WHO OFTEN CAME TO INSPECT IT WAS SO ANXIOUS LEST I SHOULD NOT SUCCEED WITH THE BRONZE THAT HE WANTED ME TO CALL IN SOME MASTER TO CASE IT FOR ME
THEREFORE I MUST LOSE NO TIME BUT TRAVEL WITH THE POST
THEN AS I HAD ALMOST MADE MY MIND UP TO SHOOT NO MORE THAT TIME WE WERE RETURNING BRISKLY TOWARD ROME
THE DATARY BEGAN TO PUT IT IN HIS POCKET SAYING
ON MY TAKING OFF MY HAT HE STOPPED AND CALLED ME AND REPORTED IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER ALL THE MESSAGES THE POPE HAD SENT ME
YOU ARE FARTHER FROM YOUR OBJECT THAN JANUARY FROM MULBERRIES. THE POOR MAN UTTERLY DISCOURAGED LOOKED ABOUT AT ONCE FOR ANOTHER HUSBAND FOR HIS GIRL
1 AND INASMUCH AS THE BAD AIR OF PISA HAD GIVEN ME A TOUCH OF FEVER I WENT WITH THE FEVER HANGING STILL ABOUT ME IN MY MASTERS COMPANY BACK TO FLORENCE
AND SINCE I WAS VERY WELL MOUNTED AND WELL ARMED WITH SHIRT AND SLEEVES OF MAIL AND CARRIED AN EXCELLENT ARQUEBUSE UPON MY SADDLE-BOW I WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE BRUTALITY AND VIOLENCE WHICH THAT MAD BEAST WAS SAID TO BE POSSESSED OF
FOR BY THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE FINISHED THAT WORK OF YOURS I WILL MAKE HASTE TO HAVE FINISHED THIS VASE WHICH I TOOK IN HAND WHEN YOU DID THE JEWEL
AN HOUR AFTER NIGHTFALL THEY LEFT ME
MATTIO DEL NAZARO TOOK THE OCCASION OF SOME FEAST-DAY TO INVITE ME AND MY WORKPEOPLE TO AN ENTERTAINMENT IN A GARDEN
THE RINGS WERE BROKEN
IN MY GREAT ASTONISHMENT I SEEMED TO SEE IN THIS THE HAND OF GOD ARRANGING AND CONTROLLING ALL
WAS OUTRAGED TO THE DEATH BY THE FRENCH PARTISANS OF PHILIP LE BEL
WHEREFORE OBSERVING THAT HIS HOLINESS HAD NEVER THOUGHT AGAIN OF GIVING ME ANYTHING AND KNOWING THAT A POST IN THE PIOMBO WAS VACANT I ASKED FOR THIS ONE EVENING
THE FORMALITIES WERE ACTS AND CUSTOMS OF THE COURT WHICH DID NOT CONCERN OBEDIENCE TO THE KING
AND FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS ARE STILL OWING TO ME AT THE PRESENT DATE WHICH IS NIGH UPON THE END OF 1566
THERE WAS AT THAT TIME IN ROME A VERY ABLE ARTIST OF PERUGIA NAMED LAUTIZIO WHO WORKED ONLY IN ONE DEPARTMENT WHERE HE WAS SOLE AND UNRIVALLED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
AS TO FLYING THE GOD OF NATURE HAD GIFTED ME WITH A BODY WELL SUITED FOR RUNNING AND LEAPING FAR BEYOND THE COMMON AVERAGE AND THAT WITH THE TALENTS I POSSESSED FOR MANUAL ART I FELT SURE I HAD THE COURAGE TO TRY FLYING
I BEGAN AT ONCE AND SPOKE
OH IF MY SOULS DESIRE HAD BEEN SET ON LUCRE I COULD HAVE STAYED IN FRANCE WITH THAT GREAT MONARCH FRANCIS WHO GAVE ME A THOUSAND GOLDEN CROWNS A YEAR FOR BOARD AND PAID ME IN ADDITION THE PRICE OF ALL MY LABOUR
PRINCE THIS BENVENUTO OF YOURS IS A TERRIBLE MAN! THE DUKE RESPONDED
IF THIS IS THE KINGS WILL WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY AGAINST IT
I KNOW VERY WELL INDEED WHAT YOU WANT AND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
OH UNFORTUNATE BUT WORTHY MAN YOU HAVE NO MORE TIME TO GO ON SLEEPING FOR ONE IS WAITING HERE TO GIVE YOU EVIL NEWS. I ANSWERED
THEREUPON I FELT THAT I HAD WON THE VICTORY IN A NASTY ENCOUNTER
THE WORD IN CELLINI IS OVOLATORE DI ZECCA
COME TELL ME BENVENUTO HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YONDER SPLENDID HEAD OF MEDUSA SO HIGH UP THERE IN THE GRASP OF PERSEUS SHOULD EVER COME OUT PERFECT? I REPLIED UPON THE INSTANT
ON EACH SIDE OF HER WAS AN ANGEL WHOSE BEAUTY FAR SURPASSES MANS IMAGINATION
AS REGARDS THE DOOR IT WAS MY IMPRESSION THAT AFTER WE HAD CHANCED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER YOUR MAJESTY GAVE ORDERS TO YOUR CHIEF SECRETARY M
THERE FLOWED INTO MY SOUL SO POWERFUL A DELIGHT FROM THESE REFLECTIONS UPON GOD THAT I TOOK NO FURTHER THOUGHT FOR ALL THE ANGUISH I HAD SUFFERED BUT RATHER SPENT THE DAY IN SINGING PSALMS AND DIVERS OTHER COMPOSITIONS ON THE THEME OF HIS DIVINITY
FOR THAT MORNING WE HAD DINED MORE THAN AN HOUR LATER THAN USUAL
VASARI CONFIRMS THIS STATEMENT
ON WITH YOU ON WITH YOU AS QUICK AS YOU CAN! AND NEVER THOUGHT HIMSELF QUITE SAFE UNTIL WE REACHED THE GATES OF FLORENCE
WE KNOW NOT FOR WHAT CRIMES YOU HOLINESS HAS KEPT HIM SO LONG IN PRISON
FOR I KNEW VERY WELL WHO HE WAS
LATER ON HE BEGAN TO HINT IN VERY MODEST TERMS THAT HE SHOULD GREATLY LIKE ME TO TAKE HIS PORTRAIT
TO THESE WORDS OF HIS HOLINESS A GENTLEMAN VERY PRIVATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM NAMED MESSER LATINO JUVINALE MADE ANSWER THAT I WAS IN HIDING FOR A MURDER COMMITTED ON THE PERSON OF ONE POMPEO OF MILAN AND SET FORTH WHAT COULD BE ARGUED FOR MY JUSTIFICATION IN THE MOST FAVOURABLE TERMS
BUT BEAR IN MIND THESE WORDS OF PROPHECY
I TOO WAS PAID ON THIS OCCASION YET I NEVER OBTAINED WHAT STILL STOOD OUT UPON MY PERSEUS
FIRE THEN ONLY FIRE! TAKING NO MORE THOUGHT ABOUT IT I STRUCK THE SUN IN THE CENTRE EXACTLY AS I SAID I SHOULD
THE YOUNG MAN IN QUESTION BEGAN TO FREQUENT THE COURT OF ROME WHERE HE SOON FOUND A SITUATION AND ENROLLED HIMSELF IN THE SUITE OF A BISHOP A MAN OF EIGHTY YEARS WHO BORE THE TITLE OF GURGENSIS
FOR IF BENVENUTO COMES BACK AND FINDS I HAVE NOT DESPATCHED HIS BUSINESS I THINK THAT HE WILL MURDER ME. THUS LAUGHING HIS EXCELLENCY ASKED TO BE REMINDED
WHEN WE HAD GONE ABOUT FOUR MILES IT BEGAN TO STORM UPON THE LAKE AND OUR OARSMEN ASKED US TO HELP IN ROWING
THIS HAD SO ANNOYED ME THAT NOT A SINGLE MOUTHFUL WHICH I ATE HAD TASTED WELL
LEONE SON OF FILIPPO STROZZI KNIGHT OF JERUSALEM AND PRIOR OF CAPUA WAS LIKE HIS BROTHER PIERO A DISTINGUISHED FRENCH GENERAL
I TURNED ROUND AND SEEING HIM UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE BEGGED HIM TO COME GENTLY SINCE THE PLACE WAS VERY DANGEROUS
BUSBACCAS NERVES HAD BEEN QUITE SHAKEN BY THE DAYS ADVENTURES
HE HAD NOT YET BEEN MADE A KNIGHT
IT IS THE BARGELLO AND ALL HIS GUARD
LXV I BELIEVE HAVE ALREADY NARRATED HOW DOMENICO AND GIOVANPAGOLO POGGINI GOLDSMITHS AND BROTHERS WERE AT WORK IN THE DUKES WARDROBE UPON SOME LITTLE GOLDEN VASES AFTER MY DESIGN CHASED WITH FIGURES IN BAS-RELIEF AND OTHER ORNAMENTS OF GREAT DISTINCTION
SINCE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE OR WILLING TO OBEY THE DIRECTIONS I GAVE YOU OBEY ME NOW THAT I AM WITH YOU TO CONDUCT MY WORK IN PERSON
3 OUR DUKE WHO GREATLY DELIGHTED IN GEMS THOUGH HE WAS NOT A SOUND JUDGE OF THEM HELD OUT GOOD HOPES TO THE ROGUE BERNARDACCIO THAT HE WOULD BUY THIS STONE
ANGELO ALLORI CALLED IL BRONZINO ONE OF THE LAST FAIRLY GOOD FLORENTINE PAINTERS WON CONSIDERABLE DISTINCTION AS A WRITER OF BURLESQUE POEMS
CELLINI HERE ALLUDES TO THE SISTINE CHAPEL AND TO THE VILLA FARNESINA IN TRASTEVERE BUILT BY THE SIENESE BANKER AGOSTINO CHIGI
THEN WHEN WE HAD MOUNTED TO THE KEEP THEY LEFT ME SHUT UP IN A DUNGEON OPENING UPON A LITTLE COURT THERE IS THERE
IF I ACT LIKE A MAN OF HONESTY I SHALL STAND IN NO FEAR. I REPLIED
NO SOONER WAS THE FURNACE READY THAN I WENT TO WORK WITH ALL DILIGENCE UPON THE CASTING OF MEDUSA THAT IS THE WOMAN TWISTED IN A HEAP BENEATH THE FEET OF PERSEUS
SO THEN AVOIDING ALL COMMERCE WITH PEOPLE IN MY TERROR OF THE PLAGUE I USED TO PUT A FOWLING-PIECE ON MY BOY PAGOLINOS SHOULDER AND HE AND I WENT OUT ALONE INTO THE RUINS
AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE BEING PRESENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED I MADE THEM STAY TO SUPPER AND ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY KEEPING MY LEG IN SPLINTS BENEATH THE BED-CLOTHES
MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO DO ONE OF THE BLOODIEST DEEDS WHICH I HAD EVER ATTEMPTED IN MY LIFE
EACH TIME HE HEARD ME I USED TO MAKE HIS TEARS FALL ACCOMPANIED WITH DEEP-DRAWN SIGHS OF SATISFACTION
THEY ALL KEPT ME WELL EMPLOYED SO THAT I EARNED PLENTY OF MONEY
TO THE POOR YOUNG MEN WHO WERE ALL DISMAYED I SAID FOR ANSWER
THE LABOUR WAS ENORMOUS
IT WAS LUCKY FOR US THAT WHENEVER WE TALKED ABOUT THAT MILANESE DONKEY WE LAUGHED AS MUCH AS OUR MISFORTUNES MADE US WEEP SO THAT WE KEPT LAUGHING AND CRYING BOTH AT THE SAME MOMENT
IT WAS VERY LARGE AND LEFT IN A WILD STATE FOR ABOUT A MILE OF OPEN GROUND HAUNTED TOO BY MULTITUDES OF PEACOCKS WHICH BRED AND NESTED THERE LIKE WILDFOWL
I REPLIED THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD INDUCE ME TO TAKE PRAISE FROM BANDINELLO SEEING THAT THIS BAD MAN SPEAKS ILL OF EVERYBODY. MY WORDS WERE CARRIED TO THE DUKE
SO PROVIDING ME WITH COMPANY HE SET ME ON THE WAY TO NAPLES
THIS I ATTEMPTED TO DISLODGE
OBEY ME TO THE LETTER
AND ALSO BECAUSE I FEARED LEST THOSE WHO HAD THE POWER MIGHT PLAY ME SOME WORSE TRICK
HEREBY IT MAY BE SEEN HOW THE POWER AND GOODNESS OF GOD NEVER LEAVE UNPUNISHED ANY SORT OR QUALITY OF MEN WHO ACT UNJUSTLY TOWARD THE INNOCENT
AND WHEN THE CONSTABLE OF BOURBON KNEW THERE WERE NO TROOPS IN ROME HE PUSHED HIS ARMY WITH THE UTMOST ENERGY UP TO THE CITY
AND IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE WHAT A DIN WE MADE BETWEEN US
WHEN MAESTRO FRANCESCO APPEARED AND SAW MY GREAT IMPROVEMENT AND THE SERVANT-GIRL IN TEARS AND THE PRENTICE RUNNING TO AND FRO AND FELICE LAUGHING ALL THIS DISTURBANCE MADE HIM THINK THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY MUST HAVE HAPPENED WHICH HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF MY AMENDMENT
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE CONSUMMATE JUDGE OF THESE THINGS
ACCORDINGLY MY ENEMY BEGAN TO BE AFRAID OF ME AND ENGAGED SOME NEAPOLITAN SOLDIERS TO DO TO ME WHAT HE WAS DREADING I MIGHT DO TO HIM
I THEREFORE KEPT THE MEDAL AND GOT NOTHING FOR MY PAINS
HEAR YOU WHAT THEY HAVE REPLIED
INDEED I SHOULD FAR MORE LIKELY HAVE TURNED TAIL
THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT ONLY THE COURIER MIGHT TALK TO THEM AND NO ONE ELSE UNDER PENALTY OF INCURRING THE SAME BANISHMENT AS THEY HAD
THEN SEIZED WITH SUDDEN ANGER AND A VEHEMENT EMOTION I BEGAN AGAIN TO ADDRESS HIM
I WILL DO IT AS QUICKLY AS I CAN AND I HOPE TO DO SOMETHING THAT SHALL MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD WONDER. THE DUKE WHO HELD HIM SOMETIMES FOR A FOOL AND SOMETIMES FOR A COWARD TURNED ABOUT IN BED AND LAUGHED AT HIS BRAGGING WORDS
AND THIS PROVES THAT A PROVERB I HAVE SOMETIMES HEARD SPOKEN IS TRUE WHICH RUNS AS FOLLOWS GOD SEND US EVIL THAT MAY WORK US GOOD. THE DUKE LISTENED TO MY STORY THROUGH MORE THAN TWO MILES OF TRAVEL KEEPING HIS ATTENTION FIXED AND ONLY UTTERING
AND NOW THE DAWN HAD RISEN OVER ME AND I FELT MYSELF IN DANGER
I REPLIED THAT IF I WERE A LATIN SCHOLAR I SHOULD BE VERY WILLING TO DO WHAT HE SUGGESTED
THE SCUDA AND THE DUCATO AT THIS EPOCH WERE RECKONED AT 7 LIRE THE LIRA AT 20 SOLDI NOTE 2
THE TIME HAD NOW COME FOR ME TO USE IT
PONDERING DAY AND NIGHT WHAT I COULD RENDER FOR MY OWN PART IN DEFENCE OF HOLY CHURCH AND HAVING NOTICED THAT THE ENEMY CHANGED GUARD AND MARCHED PAST THROUGH THE GREAT GATE OF SANTO SPIRITO WHICH WAS WITHIN A REASONABLE RANGE I THEREUPON DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO THAT SPOT
I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST WHEN I TOLD THE DUCHESS THAT I COULD NOT COMPROMISE AFFAIRS WHICH WERE NO LONGER IN MY HANDS SEEING I HAD INFORMED THE DUKE THAT I SHOULD GLADLY ACCEPT WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO GIVE ME
ON REACHING THE SPOT I FOUND THEM LOOKING LIKE THE GUARDIANS OF CHRISTS SEPULCHRE IN A PICTURE DOWNCAST AND TERRIFIED
XXXV WELL TO RETURN TO CATERINA
BUT COULD YOU TELL ME WHICH OF THOSE MEN KILLED HIM FOR ME? 1 GIOVANNI SAID YES THAT IT WAS A MAN WHO HAD A BIG TWO-HANDED SWORD WITH A BLUE FEATHER IN HIS BONNET
WHEN I ARRIVED AT FLORENCE I HOPED TO FIND MY DEAR FATHER AND KNOCKING AT THE DOOR A HUMP-BACKED WOMAN IN A FURY SHOWED HER FACE AT THE WINDOW
I SENT IN MY PETITION TO WHICH HE REPLIED IN LARGE AND AMPLE TERMS
SEE BELOW BOOK II
I MOULDED THEM IN CLAY AND SET THEM WELL UP ON IRONS
WHEREUPON I WENT TO HIM AT ONCE TAKING MY MODELS WITH ME AND MY TWO PRENTICES ASCANIO AND PAGOLO
THE MAN WHO SUFFERED FROM A FLUX OF WORDS BEGAN ONE OF HIS LONG YARNS AND WENT ON TALKING TILL AT THE LAST WHEN I SAW HIM TIRED OUT I MERELY SAID THAT HE MIGHT BRING ME TO THE POPE WHEN HE SAW FIT
HE ENTERED ROME WITH EXTRAORDINARY POMP THE DESCRIPTION OF WHICH I LEAVE TO OTHERS SINCE I MEAN TO TREAT OF THOSE THINGS ONLY WHICH CONCERN MYSELF
THEY WERE SO MUCH DELIGHTED THAT EACH OF THESE PRINCES LAVISHED ENDLESS PRAISES ON IT AND ALL THE LORDS AND GENTLEFOLK OF THEIR SUITES JOINED IN CHORUS
CXI DURING THIS WHILE ALL ROME WAS IN AN UPROAR
HOWEVER I ESCAPED THAT DANGER AND RETURNED TO THE RAGE AND FURY OF THE GUNS PURSUING MY WORK THERE WITH ALL THE ABILITY AND EAGERNESS THAT I COULD SUMMON
THEN I DISCOVERED THAT THE CAP OF THE FURNACE HAD BLOWN UP AND THE BRONZE WAS BUBBLING OVER FROM ITS SOURCE BENEATH
MOST EXCELLENT MY LORD UPON THE PIAZZA ARE NOW STANDING WORKS BY THE GREAT DONATELLO AND THE INCOMPARABLE MICHEL ANGELO THE TWO GREATEST MEN WHO HAVE EVER LIVED SINCE THE DAYS OF THE ANCIENTS
AND ONE DAY AMONG OTHERS WHEN HE WAS ANNOYING ME I GOT MORE ANGRY THAN USUAL AND CLENCHING MY FIST GAVE HIM SUCH A BLOW ON THE NOSE THAT I FELT BONE AND CARTILAGE GO DOWN LIKE BISCUIT BENEATH MY KNUCKLES
BUT THIS ARDENT TEMPER WILL BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR MAJESTYS LOSING BOTH HIM AND HIS MASTERPIECES AT THE SAME MOMENT. BY INSINUATING THESE AND OTHER SUGGESTIONS OF THE SAME SORT AT A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY THE KING CONSENTED TO THEIR PETITION
IT MAY MEAN
THE HEAD OF THE MOST PERFECT EXECUTION
AND SUCH WAS THE EFFECT UPON ME OF HIS KNAVISH WORDS THAT IN MY PASSION I FELT MY FACE IN FLAME AND SO INTOLERABLE A HEAT ATTACKED MY EYES THAT I COULD NOT FIND MY OWN WAY HOME
AND I TELL YOU FURTHER THAT YOU ARE BAD AND THAT YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE MAD AND PAUPERS AND WILL CRINGE FOR ALMS TO MY VIRTUOUS AND WEALTHY SONS. THEREUPON WE LEFT THE HOUSE MUTTERING WORDS OF ANGER ON BOTH SIDES
LASTLY I PREPARED A GREAT NUMBER OF MOULDS IN SEPARATE PIECES TO COMPOSE THE FIGURE INTENDING TO DOVETAIL THEM TOGETHER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF ART
AND WHEN THEY FOUND ME MY BRAVE FATHER TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHAT THE MAGISTRATES HAD SAID TO HIM
XCII NOW IT PLEASED MY GLORIOUS LORD AND IMMORTAL GOD THAT AT LAST I BROUGHT THE WHOLE WORK TO COMPLETION
FOR HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED IN THE CASTLE FOR FORGING A BRIEF AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS ABBREVIATOR DI PARCO MAJORIS 2 POPE ALEXANDER KEPT HIM CONFINED FOR SOME LENGTH OF TIME
BUT HE CALLED OUT
HE UNDERTOOK TO ABIDE BY HIS PROMISE TO RENEW WITHOUT RAISING FURTHER LITIGATION
FOR WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE PRESENCE HE BROKE OUT COARSELY AT ME
MASTER OF THE POST IF I ASSURE YOU THAT I DID NOT OVERRIDE YOUR HORSE WHY ARE YOU UNWILLING TO GIVE ME BACK MY PAD AND STIRRUPS? THE REPLY HE MADE WAS PRECISELY AS MAD AND BRUTAL AS HAD BEEN FORETOLD ME
I IT WAS WHO WOUNDED THE PRINCE OF ORANGE IN THE HEAD DOWN THERE BELOW THE TRENCHES OF THE CASTLE
AND I WHO HAD BEEN WORKING DAY AND NIGHT WENT TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE HIM TAKING MY MODEL SO WELL BLOCKED OUT THAT MY INTENTION COULD BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
FROM THE KING I ORDER YOU TO COME IMMEDIATELY TO HIS PRESENCE. I REPLIED
NO SOONER DID HE CATCH SIGHT OF ME THAN HE TURNED THE COLOUR OF A CORPSE AND TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE MONEY THE POPE TURNED ONCE MORE TO GAZE AT LEISURE ON THE DEXTEROUS DEVICE I HAD EMPLOYED FOR COMBINING THE DIAMOND WITH THE FIGURE OF GOD THE FATHER
WHEREUPON I SET FIRE TO MY BLOW-PIPES 3 NOT MERELY DID I DASH TO PIECES THE GABIONS WHICH STOOD IN MY WAY
WHEN I MET HIM I ASKED IF HE WAS THE RASH FELLOW WHO WAS SPEAKING EVIL OF THE FLORENTINES
FOR THIS IS AN INJURY OFFERED TO MYSELF. THAT VERY DAY WHICH WAS A THURSDAY I RECEIVED FROM ROME A FULL SAFE-CONDUCT FROM THE POPE WITH ADVICE TO GO THERE AT ONCE AND GET THE PARDON OF OUR LADYS FEAST IN MID-AUGUST IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CLEAR MYSELF FROM THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO MY HOMICIDE
THEN HAVING LAUGHED A WHILE I SAID
THEN HE ORDERED ME TO DESIGN THE REVERSE
THAT IS THE LOGGIA DE LANZI ON THE GREAT PIAZZA OF FLORENCE WHERE CELLINIS STATUE STILL STANDS
HIS COUNCIL WHO WERE PRESENT KEPT PERSUADING HIM THAT THE MONIES OUGHT TO BE STRUCK IN THE FRENCH STYLE AS THEY HAD HITHERTO ALWAYS BEEN DONE
AS YET THEY TOLD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS
MESSER AMBRUOGIO NOW BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE POPES COMMISSION AND BADE ME MAKE DRAWINGS FOR IT SAYING THAT THE BUSINESS SHOULD BE PUT AT ONCE IN TRAIN
THAT PLACE IS MY OWN HOUSE AND I KNOW WELL THAT THE MAN I GAVE IT TO DOES NOT INHABIT OR USE IT
ONLY I BESOUGHT HIM TO BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF CROWNS WHICH WERE LYING IN A LITTLE BOX NEAR MY BED AND WHEN GOD HAD THOUGHT FIT TO REMOVE ME FROM THIS WORLD TO SEND THEM TO MY POOR FATHER WRITING PLEASANTLY TO HIM IN THE WAY I TOO HAD DONE SO FAR AS THAT APPALLING SEASON OF THE PLAGUE PERMITTED
ALSO THAT I HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SUPPLEMENT THE ALLOY WITH MY PEWTER CUPS AND PLATTERS WHICH NO ONE ELSE I THINK HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
HAVING TAKEN THIS RESOLVE I SENT FOR A STRIPLING OF SIXTEEN YEARS WHO LIVED IN THE NEXT HOUSE TO MINE
FINALLY HE TOUCHED UPON THE MULTITUDE OF SARCASTIC SONNETS WHICH WERE CALLED FORTH BY HIS OWN HERCULES AND CACUS AND WOUND UP WITH ABUSING THE PEOPLE OF FLORENCE
XIV AFTER FITTING UP MY OWN LODGINGS IN THE CASTLE AND THE WORKSHOP WITH ALL CONVENIENCES FOR CARRYING ON MY BUSINESS AND PUTTING MY HOUSEHOLD UPON A MOST RESPECTABLE FOOTING I BEGAN AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT THREE MODELS EXACTLY OF THE SIZE WHICH THE SILVER STATUES WERE TO BE
ANOTHER TIME HE THOUGHT HE WAS A FROG AND HOPPED ABOUT AS FROGS DO
AND THIS IMPELLED HIM TO REBUKE THE POSTMASTER WITH WARMTH TAKING MY SIDE AND REPRIMANDING THE MANS TWO SONS FOR NOT DOING THEIR DUTY TO PASSING STRANGERS
I KNEW THAT HE WAS WELL AWARE HOW THOROUGHLY I COULD SERVE HIM IN THOSE SEVERAL BRANCHES AND I REQUIRED SOME DWELLING FITTED FOR MY BUSINESS
SAY HAVE YE SEEN CATCHPOLLS THE FAMISHED SLAVES IN ACT A POOR MANS HOMESTEAD TO DISTRAIN SMASHING DOWN CHRISTS MADONNAS WITH THEIR STAVES
1 MY REQUEST INCLINED HIM TO LEND EAR TO BANDINELLOS CALUMNIES
SO HE CAME TO MY HOUSE AND I HAD THE STATUE UNCOVERED
SINCE HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR LYONS HE TOLD MESSER GIULIANO TO TAKE ME WITH HIM ADDING THAT ON THE JOURNEY WE COULD DISCUSS SOME WORKS OF ART HIS MAJESTY HAD IT IN HIS HEAD TO EXECUTE
WHEN HE WENT AS PAPAL LEGATE TO HUNGARY IN 1532 HE ASSUMED THE AIRS AND STYLE OF A CONDOTTIERE
I ONLY KEPT TWO SHIRTS AND SOME WELL-WORN RIDING-CLOTHES WHICH I HAD UPON MY BACK
MOREOVER I WANTED A SERVANT ON HORSEBACK TO BE AT MY ORDERS AND MONEY SUFFICIENT FOR MY COSTS UPON THE WAY
IF MY FRIEND WOULD GET ME OUT OF THAT PLACE BY THE MEANS I MEANT TO TELL HIM I SHOULD ALWAYS REGARD HIM AS THE SAVIOUR OF MY LIFE AND WHEN OCCASION CAME WOULD LAY IT DOWN FOR HIM WITH GLADNESS
BACHIACCA OF WHOM I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN WAS PRESENT AT THE PARTY
I AM WILLING TO DO WHAT MY LADY DUCHESS WISHES. FROM THIS INCIDENT WE MAY LEARN TO KNOW HOW EVIL FORTUNE EXERTS HER RAGE AGAINST A POOR RIGHT-MINDED MAN AND HOW THE STRUMPET LUCK CAN HELP A MISERABLE RASCAL
FONTAINEBLEAU
IT IS TRUE THAT IF I CHOSE TO DESCRIBE SUCH LAUGHABLE EPISODES I COULD RELATE SEVERAL ODD THINGS WHICH THEN OCCURRED THROUGH PANTASILEAS JEALOUSY ON MY ACCOUNT
FEELING THAT I COULD EXPLAIN MY VIEWS MORE FRANKLY TO THESE GENTLEMEN I BEGAN BY DEMONSTRATING THAT SO MANY HISTORIES IN BRONZE WOULD COST A VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH WOULD BE TOTALLY THROWN AWAY GIVING ALL MY REASONS WHICH THEY FULLY APPRECIATED
I WENT TO FONTAINEBLEAU TO CONSULT WITH THE KING
LET US O LET US GO TOWARD BETTER LIFE
IN 1544 CHARLES V
WHEN I HAD WELL POUNDED HER SHE SWORE THAT SHE WOULD NEVER VISIT ME AGAIN
HE KEPT REPEATING THAT HE WAS A BAT AND IF THEY HEARD THAT BENVENUTO HAD FLOWN AWAY THEY MUST LET HIM GO TO CATCH ME UP SINCE HE COULD FLY BY NIGHT MOST CERTAINLY AS WELL OR BETTER THAN MYSELF
JUST AT THAT MOMENT A GREAT WAVE BROKE OVER THE BOAT
I WALKED UP AND DOWN A LARGE HALL AND THEY WERE ABOUT THREE HOURS AWAY BEFORE THEY CAME BACK FROM THE POPE
THE KING WHILE I WAS DELIVERING THIS SPEECH CONTINUED LISTENING TILL THE END WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY DROPPING A FEW WORDS SUCH AS ONLY HE COULD UTTER
MAY ONLY GOD MAINTAIN ME IN HIS GRACE
AND THIS MARK OF MINE HE WILL CARRY WITH HIM TO THE GRAVE. 2 THESE WORDS BEGAT IN ME SUCH HATRED OF THE MAN SINCE I WAS ALWAYS GAZING AT THE MASTERPIECES OF THE DIVINE MICHEL AGNOLO THAT ALTHOUGH I FELT A WISH TO GO WITH HIM TO ENGLAND I NOW COULD NEVER BEAR THE SIGHT OF HIM
WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE TRIBOLO SAID
FEDERIGO DE RICCI HAS BEEN SO MUCH STRONGER THAN ALL OF US PUT TOGETHER THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MASSACRED AGAINST OUR WILL. I DO NOT INTEND TO SAY MORE UPON THIS TOPIC SINCE IT WOULD BE TOO OFFENSIVE TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITIES OF STATE
HAVING STAYED A SHORT WHILE IN THE WORKSHOP I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING TO ALESSANDRO DEL BENE
SIMONE CIOLI CALLED IL MOSCA WAS A VERY FAIR SCULPTOR WHO DIED IN 1554 LEAVING A SON FRANCESCO CALLED IL MOSCHINO WHO WAS ALSO A SCULPTOR AND HAD REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY AT THIS EPOCH
FARTHER ON WE SHALL SEE HOW HE WITHDREW THE WAX FROM THE HOLLOW MOULD LEAVING THE SOLID MODEL INSIDE WITH SPACE ENOUGH BETWEEN THEM FOR THE METAL TO FLOW IN
THE OTHER WHO WAS A SCRIVENER LAGGED A LITTLE WAY BEHIND JEERING THE FRENCH GENTLEMAN AND ME BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN SO FRIGHTENED BY NOTHING AT ALL AS TO GIVE OURSELVES THE TROUBLE OF WALKING
WHEREAS I STROVE WITH ALL MY POWER TO BECOME EQUALLY VERSED IN ALL OF THEM
THEY VAUNTED THEMSELVES TO BE THE ABLEST CRAFTSMEN IN THE WORLD FOR WORKS OF THIS KIND AND INFORMED THE KING THAT NOTHING MORE PERFECT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN SILVER INSISTING AT THE SAME TIME UPON BEING PAID TWO THOUSAND DUCATS FOR THEIR FILTHY PIECE OF WORK
THE CAMERA APOSTOLICA WAS THE ROMAN EXCHEQUER
IT WAS SAID TO ME IN ROME BY MANY GREAT LORDS SOME OF WHOM WERE MY FRIENDS THAT THE WORK OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WAS IN THEIR OPINION OF MARVELLOUS EXCELLENCE AND GENUINE ANTIQUITY
WHO IS HE? AND THEY ANSWERED
ON THE SECOND DAY THEY DREW ME FROM THAT HOLE AND TOOK ME BACK AGAIN TO THE PRISON WHERE I HAD DRAWN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS OF GOD
IN HIS COMPANY WE TRAVELLED THROUGH BOLOGNA AND ARRIVED ONE EVENING AT FERRARA
BUT BOTH THE YOUNG MEN IMPLORED ME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TO SAVE MYSELF AND THEM AND NOT TO RUSH ON CERTAIN DEATH
FROM TIME TO TIME TOO I NOTICED THAT THE ATTORNEYS AT THE SIDE OF THE TRIBUNAL TALKED ALL AT ONCE
CONSEQUENTLY THE FIRST WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU MOST REVEREND MONSIGNOR MY GOOD MASTER SHALL BE OF MY OWN MAKING AND INVENTION
I REFER TO MY AFFAIRS IN FRANCE
I HAD PUT THE DIAMOND EXACTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE PIECE
CONSEQUENTLY I WENT THERE NO MORE AND WAS MET AGAIN WITH THE SAME OBSTRUCTIONS AS FORMERLY WHENEVER I WANTED TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE PALACE
WHEN THE DOCTOR WANTED TO SEW UP HIS WOUND AND HAD ALREADY MADE THREE STITCHES WITH HIS NEEDLE THE FELLOW TOLD HIM TO HOLD HARD A WHILE SINCE HE DID NOT WANT HIM OUT OF MALICE TO SEW HIS WHOLE MOUTH UP
I CRIED OUT TO THE YOUNG MAN TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE AND LET THE HORSE GO TO THE DEVIL
THE DUKE CONTINUALLY TREATING ME WITH THE HIGHEST IMAGINABLE MARKS OF FAVOUR
THEY WERE COMPOSED OF PASTE AND COLOURED SO AS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT OF PRECIOUS STONES PARTICULARLY DIAMONDS
MY COMPANIONS BRAVE AND ADVENTUROUS YOUNG MEN MADE SIGNS TO ME TO DRAW MY SWORD
ALL OF A SUDDEN AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE ATTENDED BY A TREMENDOUS FLASH OF FLAME AS THOUGH A THUNDERBOLT HAD FORMED AND BEEN DISCHARGED AMONGST US
THE MAIDS AND MY LADS AND EVERY ONE WHO CAME AROUND TO HELP ME GOT KICKS OR BLOWS OF THE FIST WHILE I KEPT CRYING OUT IN LAMENTATION
ONE VERY BRAVE AND CLEVER SOLDIER USED TO SAY TO ME
HE MADE A FAMOUS MEDAL OF CLEMENT VII AND WAS A PONTIFICAL MACE-BEARER
4000 WERE HIS OWN AND MINE STOOD IN HIS NAME WHILE I RECEIVED THAT PORTION OF THE INTEREST WHICH ACCRUED TO ME
THEN HE SENT WORD TO THE CASTELLAN THAT HE MEANT PRESENTLY TO DO WHAT WOULD BE PLEASING TO HIM
BUT THIS IS REALLY NONSENSE BECAUSE THE BRONZE WHEN IT HAS FIRST BEEN CAST OUGHT TO BE WORKED OVER AND BEATEN IN WITH HAMMERS AND CHISELS ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF THE ANCIENTS AND ALSO TO THAT OF THE MODERNS--I MEAN SUCH MODERNS AS HAVE KNOWN HOW TO WORK IN BRONZE
SEE GREGOROVIUS STADT ROM VOL
THEY COULD NOT UNCOVER THEIR LARGE MOULD UNTIL THEY HAD EXTRACTED MY TWO HEADS
THE ELDER BIT HIS THUMB SHRIEKING THREATS OUT WITH THAT HIDEOUS VOICE OF HIS WHICH COMES FORTH THROUGH HIS NOSE
HE CRIED OUT THAT HE WOULD PRESENTLY SHOW ME A CROSS WHICH SHOULD MAKE ME REPENT
216
I WAS ASKED BY THE LEARNED MEN WHO HAD COMPOSED THAT BEAUTIFUL EPITAPH WHEREFORE I USED THESE BROKEN LETTERS
PIETRO PAGOLO GALLEOTTI MUCH PRAISED BY VASARI FOR HIS ARTISTIC SKILL
HE ANSWERED
HE ANSWERED
HE ANSWERED
THE CARTOONS TO WHICH CELLINI HERE ALLUDES WERE MADE BY MICHEL ANGELO AND LIONARDO FOR THE DECORATION OF THE SALA DEL GRAN CONSIGLIO IN THE PALAZZO VECCHIO AT FLORENCE
YOU HAVE GOT MIXED UP WITH A SET OF ROGUES
HE SERVED DUKE ALESSANDRO IN AFFAIRS OF MUCH IMPORTANCE
YET FINDING THAT THE DRAMA OF MY LIFE REQUIRES HIS PRESENCE I SHALL INTRODUCE HIM HERE AT THE MOMENT OF MY GREATEST TRIALS IN ORDER THAT AS HE WAS THEN MY COMFORT AND SUPPORT I MAY NOW RECALL TO MEMORY THE GOOD HE DID ME
I WOULD HANG THAT BENVENUTO OF YOURS BY THE NECK AND THUS YOU WOULD KEEP HIM FOR EVER IN YOUR KINGDOM. SHE BROKE INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER PROTESTING THAT I RICHLY DESERVED IT
THEN DECOCT THEM OVER A SLACK FIRE
ONE OF THESE WHICH I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE BROUGHT ME INTO THE GREATEST RISK OF MY LIFE
THEREFORE HE ADVISED HIS MAJESTY TO LEAVE ME ALONE ADDING THAT HE KEPT ME IN PRISON FOR HOMICIDES AND OTHER DEVILTRIES WHICH I HAD PLAYED
THERE I BADE HIM LEAVE ME SAYING HE MUST RUN BACK TO HIS DONKEY
THEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE ME NOT EMPLOY MY STRENGTH ON MANUAL LABOUR BUT TAKE AS MANY MEN AS I WANTED AND MAKE THEM DO THE ROUGH WORK
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO USE SOME WORDS BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF TRUTH SPEAK THEM TO DO ME SERVICE
NOW LANDI HAD BEEN MY INTIMATE FRIEND FROM CHILDHOOD AND WHEN HE SAW THAT I ENJOYED THE DUKES CONFIDENCE HE CALLED ME ASIDE IT WAS JUST BEFORE NOON AT A CORNER OF THE MERCATO NUOVO AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
AND THEN THE VASE WAS CARRIED TO SALAMANCA WHO ORDERED IT TO BE VALUED
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER ON THE 7TH OF JUNE AT THIRTEEN HOURS OF THE DAY IN 1544 WHEN I HAD EXACTLY REACHED THE AGE OF FORTY-FOUR
I LAUGHED AT THIS AND SO WE SET OFF JOINING THE COURIER TO VENICE WHO WAS NICKNAMED IL LAMENTONE
IN QUEL GIRARE CHE E FANNO E CIBI I HAVE FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS USED THE TECHNICAL PHRASE ABOVE
THE HOUSEHOLD OF CARDINAL FARNESE MUST HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS TO GO AND DO ME SOME INJURY
THEN I WILL SHOW HIS EXCELLENCY THAT I HAVE BEEN THE MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT HE WILL EVER HAVE IN ALL HIS LIFE
AND I AM NOT SURE WHETHER CELLINI DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE LADIES HAD BEHIND THEIR BACKS A TAPESTRY REPRESENTING JASMINES IN A NATURAL MANNER
THAT FELLOW LIVES AND TRIUMPHS IN HIS INFINITE DISTRESS WHILE I LACK ALL THINGS IN THE MIDST OF COMFORT AND AM DYING ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIM
MY DEAR MASTER KNOW THAT I AM NOT RAVING AND THAT IT IS TRUE THAT THIS OLD MAN IS REALLY GIVING ME ANNOYANCE
IT SEEMED TO ME WHILE DREAMING THAT I WAS ALWAYS IN THE VISIBLE COMPANY OF THAT BEING WHOSE VOICE AND TOUCH WHILE HE WAS STILL INVISIBLE I HAD SO OFTEN FELT
AND WHILE I WAS WORKING I WROTE THE FOLLOWING SONNET ADDRESSED TO THE CASTELLAN IF I MY LORD COULD SHOW TO YOU THE TRUTH OF THAT ETERNAL LIGHT TO ME BY HEAVEN IN THIS LOW LIFE REVEALED YOU SURE HAD GIVEN MORE HEED TO MINE THAN TO A MONARCHS SOOTH
IT WAS BROUGHT TO ME BEFORE DINNER
WITH SOLDIERS THERE IS ONLY THE CAPE AND SWORD TO GAIN
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH
FOR RENZO DI CERI SEE ABOVE
DANTE THEN WHO ALSO UNDERSTOOD FRENCH WELL MADE USE OF THE PHRASE IN QUESTION AND IT HAS STRUCK ME AS SINGULAR THAT THIS INTERPRETATION HAS NEVER YET BEEN PUT UPON THE PASSAGE
THIS BUONARROTI AND I USED WHEN WE WERE BOYS TO GO INTO THE CHURCH OF THE CARMINE TO LEARN DRAWING FROM THE CHAPEL OF MASACCIO
YOUR THREATS DO NOT FRIGHTEN ME AT ALL
UN MONTE DI ASINI LXXVII AFTER WE HAD SUPPED A BARGE-MAN APPEARED AND OFFERED TO TAKE US TO VENICE
BUT I BEGGED THE SECRETARY TO HAVE THE KINDNESS TO TELL ME WHAT LETTERS OF NATURALISATION MEANT
WHAT IS UP? HERE ARE ALL YOUR PRECIOUS STONES AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS MISSING. AT THIS THE POPES FACE CLEARED AND HE SAID
AND SINCE THE DOORS WERE ALWAYS OPEN TO ME I LIFTED THE CURTAIN GENTLY AND SAW THE POPE IN PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH THE MARCHESE DEL GUASTO
THIS ROUSED THE JEALOUSY OF THE BAD MEN AMONG MY FORMER MASTERS WHO WERE CALLED SALVADORE AND MICHELE GUASCONTI
IN FLORENCE WE REMAINED FOUR DAYS DURING WHICH PAGOLO GOT WELL
2 SO THEN JUST AS BANDINELLOS WORK DESERVED ALL THE EVIL WHICH HE TELLS US WAS THEN SAID ABOUT IT BUONARROTIS DESERVED THE ENTHUSIASTIC PRAISE WHICH WAS BESTOWED UPON IT. THESE WORDS OF MINE MADE BANDINELLO BURST WITH FURY
DE LA FA TO THIS EFFECT THAT ALL THESE GENTLEMEN SHOULD KEEP ME GOING AT THE WORK AND SEE THAT I OBTAINED THE NECESSARY FUNDS
ONE SAID ONE THING ONE ANOTHER AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD NEVER GO THENCE BEFORE I KNEW WHO HAD ACCUSED ME
I WILL PAY WHEN I HEAR AT LEISURE HOW THE WHOLE THING HAPPENED. WHAT CAUSED ME THE MOST PAIN AND MADE ME LOSE MY SENSES AND TAKE FRIGHT-SO CONTRARY TO MY REAL NATURE-WAS THE DREAD LEST PERADVENTURE FOLK SHOULD FANCY I HAD TRUMPED A STORY OF THE ROBBER UP TO STEAL THE JEWELS
THE HORSE EXTRICATED ITSELF BY A GREAT EFFORT WHEN WE HAD GIVEN IT UP FOR LOST
AND HE RANKING AMONG THE BEST OF THE IMPROVISATORI SANG THERE
METAPHORICALLY A MESS GALLIMAUFRY
A STOUT SOUL AND A STEADFAST MUST THE MAN HAVE WHO SETS HIMSELF TO SUCH AN ENTERPRISE. I ANSWERED THAT OF STRENGTH AND STEADFASTNESS OF SOUL I SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE PROVIDED I FOUND THE OPPORTUNITY
ON IT I ENGRAVED IN INTAGLIO TWO LITTLE HISTORIES THE ONE OF SAN GIOVANNI PREACHING IN THE WILDERNESS THE OTHER OF SANT AMBROGIO EXPELLING THE ARIANS 4 ON HORSEBACK WITH A LASH IN HIS HAND
THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT I ABODE IN DARKNESS ENDURING MY LOT NOR EVER WITHOUT MEDITATIONS UPON GOD AND ON OUR HUMAN FRAILTY
MARIA DEL FIORE NOTE 5
IF THIS CANNOT BE HAD IN ONE BENEFICE LET HIM HAVE TWO OR THREE TO THAT AMOUNT FOR IN HIS CASE IT WILL COME TO THE SAME THING. AS I WAS STANDING BY I COULD HEAR WHAT THE KING SAID AND THANKED HIS MAJESTY AT ONCE FOR THE DONATION AS THOUGH I WERE ALREADY IN POSSESSION
FOR MY WORD ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH INASMUCH AS MAESTRO GIACOMO HAD CUNNINGLY INSISTED UPON CARRYING OFF THE OLD DRAWINGS WITH HIM
THE POPE TOOK MY PATENT AND HANDED IT TO THE DATARY TELLING HIM TO LOSE NO TIME IN DISPATCHING THE BUSINESS
TURNING TO HIS ADMIRAL WHO WAS CALLED MONSIGNOR ANIBALLE 2 HE SAID
I HAD TAKEN MY FATHERS PART
ILL SHOW YOU WITH THIS WEAPON THAT I AM NOT ABLE. WISHING TO PROVE HE WAS IN EARNEST MAGALOTTI THEN SEIZED HIS OWN AND CAME TOWARD ME
THAT OTHER WITH SO GRACIOUS AND BENIGN A MIEN STANDS FOR GENEROSITY LACKING WHICH THE MENTAL GIFTS BESTOWED ON US BY GOD WILL NOT BE BROUGHT TO VIEW
IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SORT OF CUSHION FLUNG UPON THE SADDLE AND TO WHICH THE STIRRUPS WERE ATTACHED
THEN I SAID
THEN I SAID
THEN I SAID
THEN I SAID
MARK MY WORDS THEN SER PIER FRANCESCO RICCIO
AND DURING OUR MERRY MEETING ALL THAT EVENING WE TALKED NO MORE ABOUT DEAD FOLK BUT RATHER DISCOURSED GAILY ABOUT WEDDINGS
MY GOOD HOUSEKEEPER WITHOUT MY GIVING ANY ORDERS HAD PREPARED A FAT CAPON FOR MY REPAST
THIS IS OBSCURE
I ON THE CONTRARY WITH MY POOR WITS COULD GAIN ENOUGH TO KEEP ME COMFORTABLY
LXIX IT HAPPENED ON ONE FEAST-DAY THAT I WENT TO THE PALACE AFTER DINNER AND WHEN I REACHED THE CLOCKROOM I SAW THE DOOR OF THE WARDROBE STANDING OPEN
HE ENGAGES HIS WORD NOT TO BREAK THE SEAL AND TO RETURN THE PIECE TO YOU UNTOUCHED
GO AND TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AS INDEED I KNOW THAT YOU ARE. NOTE 1
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE TO REPENT OF MY WAYWARDNESS
BEING THUS IN ANGER HE EXCLAIMED
THE SPANISH VICEROY WAS AT THIS TIME PIETRO ALVAREZ DE TOLEDO MARQUIS OF VILLAFRANCA AND UNCLE OF THE FAMOUS DUKE OF ALVA
HERE THE HOST INSISTED UPON BEING PAID BEFORE WE WENT TO BED AND IN HIS OWN WAY
IN THE MORNING WE ROSE EARLY AND MOUNTED OUR HORSES FOR THE PORT WHICH IS A FEW MILES DISTANT FROM FERRARA
GIOVANNI GRECO MAY HAVE BEEN A GIOVANNI VERGEZIO WHO PRESENTED DUKE COSIMO WITH SOME GREEK CHARACTERS OF EXQUISITE FINISH
SEE LECLANCHè P
I WANT YOURS TO BE FINISHED QUICKLY SO THAT I MAY ENJOY THE USE OF IT A LITTLE WHILE
FOR ONE THING I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE WERE FOLLOWING THE COURT WITH THE WEARIEST TROUBLE AND FATIGUE
BUT WHAT WAS BETTER BY THAT ONE BLAST I SLAUGHTERED MORE THAN THIRTY MEN
ON THEIR ARRIVAL THEN FROM PISA BOTH THEIR EXCELLENCIES ARRIVED ONE DAY QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY ATTENDED BY ALL THE NOBLES OF THEIR COURT WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INSPECTING MY CRUCIFIX
SO SOON AS THE FIRST ARMFULS ARRIVED I BEGAN TO FILL THE GRATE BENEATH THE FURNACE
UPON ONE OCCASION AMONG OTHERS ARRIVING IN MY CUSTOMARY WAY THE DUKE WHO HAD PROBABLY BEEN TALKING WITH THE DUCHESS ABOUT PRIVATE MATTERS TURNED UPON ME IN A FURIOUS ANGER
THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER DRAW THE LEASE FOR FIVE YEARS TO BE RENEWED ON THE EXPIRY OF THE TERM
GO BENVENUTO AND COME AGAIN QUICKLY FOR INDEED I AM JEALOUS OF YOU. NOTE 1
XLV WHEN HE HAD WOUND UP THIS SERMON AGREED UPON BEFOREHAND WITH HIS DARLING MADAME DETAMPES I BENT ONE LEG UPON THE GROUND AND KISSED HIS COAT ABOVE THE KNEE
NOT FOR A MADMAN BUT FOR A YOUNG FELLOW; AND I SWORE TO HIM BY GOD
HE WAS EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTED AND WHEN I SAW HIM IN GOOD HOMIER I BEGGED HIS MAJESTY TO GRANT ME THE FAVOUR OF PERMITTING ME TO TRAVEL INTO ITALY
VARCHI SAYS THAT A MAN WHO WENT ABOUT WITH ONLY HIS CLOAK OR CAPE BY DAYTIME IF HE WERE NOT A SOLDIER WAS REPUTED AN ILL-LIVER
SO ABLY DID HE PLEAD MY CAUSE THAT HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM THIS IMPENDING TEMPEST
THE ENGLISH HAD TAKEN BOULOGNE FOUR DAYS EARLIER
SO THAT WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO DRAW ONE OUT I MET WITH THE GREATEST TROUBLE
HE WAS CESARES UNCLE A SURGEON BY PROFESSION AND A DABBLER IN ALCHEMY
WHILE LOOKING AT THE DIAMOND THE POPE WHISPERED TO ME
AND UNDER IT RAN THE LEGEND SUMMA TULISSE JUVAT 3 FEDERIGO WAS SO THOROUGHLY WELL PLEASED THAT HE PAID ME VERY LIBERALLY
OF A TRUTH I NEVER WAS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE
CATERINA RELATE ALL THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND BENVENUTO. SHE ANSWERED THAT I HAD USED HER AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION
MEANWHILE LUIGI PULCI HAVING RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND RODE EVERY DAY UPON THE BLACK HORSE WHICH WAS SO WELL TRAINED TO HEEL AND BRIDLE
ON ASKING THE KING WHERE HE WANTED ME TO SET UP MY JUPITER MADAME DETAMPES WHO HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO PLACE MORE APPROPRIATE THAN HIS OWN HANDSOME GALLERY
WHAT IS ASCANIO CRYING FOR
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT WITH HIM WAS BROUGHT ME WHICH I ACCEPTED VERY GLADLY SAYING THAT I EXPECTED TO COMPLETE THIS JOB FAR QUICKER THAN THOSE OF THE OTHER ART I PRACTISED
LORD GOD GIVE AID TO MY GOOD CAUSE
I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT
IF THE POPE COULD HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT LOSING CREDIT HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN FIERCE REVENGE UPON ME
3 AFTER HE HAD PUT AFFAIRS OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE IN ORDER THE NEW POPE SENT FOR ME SAYING THAT HE DID NOT WISH ANY ONE ELSE TO STRIKE HIS COINS
ONE OF MY MEN WAS FINISHING THE HEAD ANOTHER THE LEGS
THIS IS THE MOST MARVELLOUS THING THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE COURSE OF MY WHOLE LIFETIME
MY MIND WAS MADE UP TO QUIT FERRARA WITHOUT FAIL THAT VERY DAY
AND THOUGH I AM BY NATURE A LOVER OF CLEANLINESS AT THAT TIME I KEPT MYSELF UNUSUALLY SPICK AND SPAN
IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEAR OF PLAGUE OR PERHAPS OF SOME ENEMY
WITHOUT THEIR LEAVE YOU SUFFERED ME TO FIX MY CLAMPS AND OTHER NECESSARY FITTINGS. ON THIS ACCOUNT I REFUSED TO GIVE THOSE FRUITS OF MY ENORMOUS LABOURS TO THE CHURCH OF S
THIS WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH LIII I WENT ON WORKING ASSIDUOUSLY AT THE BUTTON AND AT THE SAME TIME LABOURED FOR THE MINT WHEN CERTAIN PIECES OF FALSE MONEY GOT ABROAD IN ROME STAMPED WITH MY OWN DIES
VASARI NARRATES HIS LOVE-ADVENTURES WITH LUCREZIA BUTI AND ROBERT BROWNING HAS DRAWN A CLEVER PORTRAIT OF HIM IN HIS MEN AND WOMEN. HIS SON FILIPPO OR FILIPPINO WAS ALSO AN ABLE PAINTER SOME OF WHOSE BEST WORK SURVIVES IN THE STROZZI CHAPEL OF S
THIS WAS AS WE SHOULD SAY IN TUSCANY A LOGGIA OR MORE EXACTLY A LARGE LOBBY
THE KING MAKES YOU A GIFT OF THESE IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY BE ENCOURAGED TO SERVE HIM
IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUIGI AND PANTASILEA ATTENDED BY A CERTAIN MESSER BENVEGNATO OF PERUGIA WHO WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO POPE CLEMENT AND FOLLOWED BY FOUR DOUGHTY CAPTAINS OF PERUGIA WITH SOME OTHER VALIANT SOLDIERS IN THE FLOWER OF YOUTH
OH WHY SHOULD I INJURE A MAN BOTH WORTHY AND INNOCENT WHO HAS ONLY DONE ME SERVICES AND HONOUR
BUT AFTERWARDS HE BETRAYED THE INTERESTS OF HIS MASTER DUKE COSIMO IN AN EMBASSY TO CHARLES V IN 1543

FOR IF WE HAD ONCE CAUSE TO LOWER THE PORTCULLIS IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS BUT MUST INEVITABLY STICK SUSPENDED UPON ONE OF THE WAGGONS
CELLINI WHO GETS ABOUT A THOUSAND CROWNS A YEAR FROM ME CAN SURELY LET ME HAVE THIS MASTERPIECE FOR TWO THOUSAND CROWNS OF GOLD SINCE HE HAS HIS SALARY INTO THE BARGAIN. THEN I EXHIBITED OTHER THINGS IN GOLD AND SILVER AND A VARIETY OF MODELS FOR NEW UNDERTAKINGS
I WENT ON WORKING AT THE SURFACE EMPLOYING SOME HOURS BEFORE SUNRISE OR NOW AND THEN ON FEAST-DAYS SO AS NOT TO LOSE THE TIME I NEEDED FOR MY PERSEUS
THIS I ACCORDINGLY DID
BENVENUTO IT IS SURELY DANGEROUS TO EMBARK IN THIS CRAFT WITH FOUR HORSES. I REPLIED
IT IS TRUE THAT CERTAIN GERMANS AND FRENCHMEN WHO VAUNT THE POSSESSION OF MARVELLOUS SECRETS PRETEND THAT THEY CAN CAST BRONZES WITHOUT RETOUCHING THEM
WHEN THE TERM WAS OVER I SAID NOTHING BUT TOOK GERMANS ITALIANS AND FRENCHMEN BEARING ARMS AND MANY HAND-LABOURERS WHOM I HAD IN MY EMPLOY AND IN A SHORT WHILE GUTTED ALL HIS HOUSE AND FLUNG HIS PROPERTY OUTSIDE MY CASTLE
MY SON THE LOVE I BEAR YOU IS SO GREAT THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE HONOUR OF OUR FAMILY WHICH ABOVE ALL THINGS I REGARD I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE SET OFF FOR YOU
I TOO AM SENTENCED TO AN UNJUST DEATH AND I THANK GOD WITH HUMILITY FOR THIS SIGN OF GRACE
THE BASIN WAS EXECUTED IN A SIMILAR STYLE WITH ROUND FIGURES AND FISHES IN BAS-RELIEF
MEETING ME ONE DAY BY ACCIDENT HE GAVE ME A HEARTY WELCOME AND ASKED ME HOW LONG I HAD BEEN IN ROME
NOW THIS GIRL WAS A CLEAN MAID AND I GOT HER WITH CHILD
9 NOTE 1
HULLO MY MASTER
I BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS IS KNOWN AS CASTING á CIRE PERDUE THE FORMA OR MOULD CONSISTED OF TWO PIECES
BUT OF THE GENERAL TRUSTWORTHINESS OF HIS RECORD OF THE KIND OF MAN HE WAS AND THE KIND OF LIFE HE LED THERE IS NO REASONABLE DOUBT
THEN IN A MOMENT I CONCEIVED THAT I HAD EATEN SOMETHING POISONOUS AND RACKED MY BRAINS TO THINK WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN
GOING INTO THE INN I PUT MY HORSE UP AND ASCENDED TO A LARGE GALLERY WHERE I FOUND A PARTY OF NEAPOLITAN GENTLEMEN JUST UPON THE POINT OF SITTING DOWN TO TABLE
FOOD CAME FROM THE POPE WHICH I REFUSED TO TOUCH ONLY EATING THAT WHICH CAME FROM CARDINAL CORNARO
AND WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE POPE I FOUND HIM IN BED IN A MOST DEPLORABLE CONDITION
HE MEANS GHIBERTIS SECOND DOOR IN ALL PROBABILITY
FECESI QUELLE ORAZIONI IT MAY MEAN THE PRAYERS WERE OFFERED UP. XLIII UPON MY ARRIVAL IN ROME 1 I FOUND SEVERAL OF MY FORMER FRIENDS BY WHOM I WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED AND KINDLY ENTERTAINED
HAD I ONLY SEEN YOU PUT THE SOUL 2 INTO YOUR MOULD I COULD HAVE TAUGHT YOU WITH ONE WORD HOW TO CAST THE FIGURE WITHOUT FAULT
NOW I AM FAMISHED AND FEEL MY FORCES FAILING
AFTERWARDS I RETIRED TO BED HEALTHY AND HAPPY FOR IT WAS NOW TWO HOURS BEFORE MORNING AND SLEPT AS SWEETLY AS THOUGH I HAD NEVER FELT A TOUCH OF ILLNESS
I PAID THE LAWYERS AND TOOK MY DEPARTURE
ALTHOUGH THIS STATUE SEEMS IN OUR EYES A VERY FINE PIECE STILL IT HAS YET TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF THE PEOPLE
THE GONFALONIER THAT IS SODERINI WHOM I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED TOOK MUCH PLEASURE IN MAKING ME CHATTER AND GAVE ME COMFITS AND WAS WONT TO SAY TO MY FATHER
OUR TERMS WERE THAT THE ESTATE SHOULD REVERT AT THE TERM OF THREE YEARS 2 AND I GAVE THEM A LEASE OF IT
I DO NOT CONDESCEND TO SMITE YOU. HE LOOKED AT ME SUBMISSIVELY AND SAID NOTHING
SEEING HIM CHEERFUL AS I WISHED I UNCOVERED THE OTHER MODEL WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM EXPECTING SINCE HE NOT UNREASONABLY JUDGED THAT THE FIRST HAD WORK IN IT ENOUGH
AFTER I HAD DONE SO IT PRODUCED A FAR FINER EFFECT THAN EVEN IT HAD MADE BEFORE AND I WAS GREATLY SATISFIED
AND SO WE GOT UNDER WAY FOR VENICE
240 FOR CELLINIS VOW IN THE CASTLE OF S
10 THEN DID A SOLITARY SPARROW CRY LOUD FROM THE KEEP
HAVING THIS IN VIEW HE ORDERED A HERCULES TO BE EXECUTED IN SILVER EXACTLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS MY JUPITER
SO YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE TO DO. HE THEN TOLD HIS LIEUTENANT TO INSTALL ME IN THE NELLO
LAMENTONE THE COURIER MEANWHILE WAS SWELLING AND SNORTING LIKE THE WIND
I MEANWHILE WAS INDULGING MYSELF IN ALL THE PLEASURES MAN CAN THINK OF AND HAD ENGAGED IN ANOTHER LOVE AFFAIR MERELY TO DROWN THE MEMORY OF MY REAL PASSION
I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF THIS RIGMAROLE. AT LAST THE ANIMAL BECAME SO TIRESOME THAT I SAID
AND ON THE WAY A YOUTH CALLED CECCHINO DELLA CASA JOINED HIMSELF TO US
A VILLAGE IN THE SABINA NORTH OF TIVOLI
AND A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS CESARE MACHERONE THE FALSE COINER WAS HANGED IN THE BANCHI OPPOSITE THE MINT
THEN GIVING IT BACK ADDED
FRA FILIPPO LIPPI WAS A CARMELITE MONK WHOSE FRESCOES AT PRATO AND SPOLETA AND OIL-PAINTINGS IN FLORENCE AND ELSEWHERE ARE AMONG THE MOST GENIAL WORKS OF THE PRE-RAPHAELITE RENAISSANCE
THAT IS TO SAY LACK OF MONEY AND A HUNDRED UNTOWARD ACCIDENTS THE HALF OF WHICH WOULD HAVE COWED A MAN ARMED WITH ADAMANT
ILL LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF YOUR SWORDS THERE AND WILL DO YOU A MISCHIEF THAT WILL MAKE YOU WONDER
IT CAME TO PASS ONE SUNDAY EVENING THAT WE WERE INVITED TO SUP TOGETHER WITH THE SIENESE SCULPTOR MICHEL AGNOLO AND THE TIME OF THE YEAR WAS SUMMER
AND SO IT TURNED OUT THAT ALL OF THEM HAD STUCK THAT FAMOUS DIAMOND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BREAST OF GOD THE FATHER
MESSER GIOVANNI HOWEVER SAID
GOD KNOWS I HAD GREAT NEED OF THAT FOR I WAS EAGER TO FINISH MY PERSEUS AND HAD ENGAGED SOME JOURNEYMEN WHOM I PAID OUT OF MY OWN PURSE
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PUT THE WHOLE LARGE PIECE TOGETHER SINCE I WAS NEW TO THE CRAFT AND HIS EXCELLENCY OUGHT TO TAKE GOOD HEED HE DID NOT THROW HIS MONEY AWAY
ACCORDINGLY I BADE FAREWELL TO ALL THE COMPANY AND HAVING THANKED OUR HOSTESS TOOK MY LEAVE
SO THAT WHEN I ROSE ABOUT THE HOUR FOR BREAKING FAST SHE PRESENTED HERSELF WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE AND SAID
HOWEVER ALL THOSE BRAVI RAN UP TO THE CORPSE AND TOOK NO ACTION AGAINST ME
SO I TOOK IN HAND WITHOUT CONSULTING THE KING TO MAKE A GREAT TWO-HANDLED VASE ABOUT ONE CUBIT AND A HALF IN HEIGHT
ONE HOLLOW LA TONACA WHICH GAVE SHAPE TO THE BRONZE
WHEN THE BOY PERCEIVED THE IMPROVEMENT HE HAD MADE HE ESTEEMED IT A GOOD PIECE OF LUCK THAT HE HAD COME INTO MY HANDS
THUS GOD GRANTS US THOSE LAWFUL BLESSINGS WHICH WE ASK IN PRAYER NOTHING DOUBTING
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE SACRED MAJESTY THAT BENVENUTO SHOULD ACCOMPLISH THE TWELVE SILVER STATUES WHICH YOU WANT
THEN I MADE HER SERVE MY PLEASURE OUT OF SPITE AGAINST HER HUSBAND JEERING AT THEM BOTH THE WHILE
WHEN I HOPED THAT HE WAS COMING TO EXECUTE IT HE CAME AND TOLD ME THAT FOR MY OWN GOOD HE MEANT TO DISOBEY ME BEING CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM MEN CLOSE TO THE POPES PERSON WHO UNDERSTOOD THE REAL STATE OF MY AFFAIRS
BUT IF YOUR EXCELLENCY GOES ON DISHEARTENING ME AND DOES NOT ADVANCE ME THE ASSISTANCE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN ALIVE UPON THIS EARTH CAN HOPE TO ACHIEVE THE SLIGHTEST THING OF VALUE. NOTE 1
SOME BUSINESS OR OTHER MADE HIM ENTER THE APOTHECARYS SHOP WHICH STOOD AT THE CORNER OF CHIAVICA AND THERE HE STAYED A WHILE TRANSACTING IT
BUT I WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY
WHILE HE WAS IN ROME THEN BEING A MAN GIVEN TO BACK-BITING HE SPOKE SO ILL OF RAFFAELLO DA URBINOS WORKS THAT THE PUPILS OF THE LATTER WERE QUITE RESOLVED TO MURDER HIM
I GOT MYSELF IN READINESS AND TOLD PAGOLO THAT HE MIGHT GO ABROAD TOO AND AMUSE HIMSELF WITH US
HIS TITLE WAS DERIVED FROM ITS BEING HIS DUTY TO AFFIX THE DATUM ROMæ TO DOCUMENTS
63
1 I HAD BEEN SOME TIME AT HOME AND WAS HARD AT WORK
AND SINCE THE POPE HAS PLENTY OF SERVANTS DO NOT LET HIM SEND YOU ROUND AGAIN IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE
1 AND THEY SAID
THE CONVERSATION FALLING UPON SOMETHING OF THE KIND WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT FOR YOUR INSPECTION I SHOWED YOU A MODEL MADE BY ME IN ITALY
UPON MY WORD IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SO UNPROTECTED
THUS THEN WHILE I SPENT MANY HOURS A DAY IN PRAYER WITH DEEP EMOTION OF THE SPIRIT TOWARD CHRIST I USED ALWAYS TO SAY
AMONG THEM WAS THE CHIMæRA THAT BRONZE LION WHICH IS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOMS ADJACENT TO THE GREAT HALL OF THE PALACE
OIMè SAPRESTIMI TU DIRE CHE DI QUELLI ME IHA MORTO THE ME IS SO EMPHATIC THAT THOUGH IT MAKES POOR ENGLISH I HAVE PRESERVED IT IN MY VERSION
THERE HE FIRST GAINED REPUTATION BY A VENUS WHICH THE PRINCE FRANCESCO BOUGHT
2 BUT IF I BROUGHT IT HE WOULD PAY ITS PRICE DOWN
SO WE WENT FORWARD SEVERAL MILES IN THIS GREAT PERIL OF OUR LIVES
LET THE DAY PASS
I FELT ABSOLUTELY OBLIGED TO GO AND FLING MYSELF UPON MY BED
YOUR OWN GOOD JUDGMENT WILL ENABLE YOU TO SELECT THE BEST
MY FATHER DYING WITH JOY AT SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY SENT ME OFF
ALL THE SAME WHILE SMARTING HE BEGAN TO CRY
AND WHEN I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS MAKING LITTLE WAY AND AT THE SAME TIME WAS INFLICTING SEVERE PAIN ON THE PATIENT I BEGGED HIM TO STOP AND WAIT HALF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOR ME
THE BOY WENT AWAY WEEPING
THEY LOOKED LIKE A HERD OF SWINE
ALL THESE I PUT AWAY TOGETHER IN MY MATTRESS WHERE I ALSO KEPT THE STRIPS OF LINEN I HAD MADE
SO I WILL EMPLOY YOU ON A PIECE OF THE VERY GREATEST CONSEQUENCE WHERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT ALL YOUR TALENTS
IF THAT IS YOUR MIND YOU AND HE HAVE STRUCK A BARGAIN WITHOUT THE NEED OF FURTHER SPEECH
THEN THE RASCAL WAS ASHAMED AND WANTED TO DETAIN ME ALMOST BY FORCE
AND WHILE I WAS SPEAKING WITH HIS HOLINESS MESSER AVERARDO SERRISTORI OUR DUKES ENVOY ARRIVED
I STAYED WITH HER FROM EVENFALL UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND ENJOYED SUCH PLEASURE AS I NEVER HAD BEFORE OR SINCE
CELLINI HERE REFERS TO THE ATTACK MADE UPON ROME BY THE GREAT GHIBELLINE HOUSE OF COLONNA LED BY THEIR CHIEF CAPTAIN POMPEO IN SEPTEMBER 1526
FOR THOUGH THE FEVER NEVER LEFT ME THAT INSTRUMENT IS SO EASY THAT IT DID NOT HURT ME TO PLAY UPON IT
ON THE DESCENT WHETHER IT WAS THAT I THOUGHT I HAD REALLY COME TO EARTH AND RELAXED MY GRASP TO JUMP OR WHETHER MY HANDS WERE SO TIRED THAT THEY COULD NOT KEEP THEIR HOLD AT ANY RATE I FELL STRUCK MY HEAD IN FALLING AND LAY STUNNED FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE
FRIEND TASSO THIS IS GODS DOING THAT WE HAVE REACHED THIS GATE WITHOUT EITHER YOU OR ME NOTICING THAT WE WERE THERE
AND I WAS STILL UNPROVIDED
NOWHERE CAN WE GAIN A BETTER IDEA THAN IN THIS BOOK OF THE PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM FOR THE CREATION OF BEAUTY WHICH HAS BESTOWED UPON THE ITALY OF THE RENAISSANCE ITS GREATEST GLORY
NEXT DAY THEREFORE HE COMMISSIONED TOBBIA TO MOUNT THE UNICORNS HORN AND SENT HIS MASTER OF THE WARDROBE TO BID ME FINISH THE CHALICE
I TURNED TO ALESSANDRO AND SAID
THUS THEN I FED UPON THIS TRIFLING MARK OF FAVOUR WHICH IN FACT PROVED THE SALVATION OF MY LIFE
THE WORD MANICA IS THE SAME AS OUR MANUCH AN ANTIQUE FORM OF SLEEVE
XLIV I WENT ACCORDINGLY AND WAITED FOR THE GOOD KINGS VISIT WHO IT SEEMS HAD GONE MEANWHILE TO TAKE LEAVE OF MADAME DETAMPES
INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PROFIT I MADE BY THIS TRAFFIC WHICH WAS AT LEAST TENFOLD IT BROUGHT ME ALSO INTO AGREEABLE RELATIONS WITH NEARLY ALL THE CARDINALS OF ROME
JUST OPPOSITE STRETCHED A GARDEN BELONGING TO AN INNKEEPER CALLED ROMOLO
IN OTHER PARTS OF PISA ALSO I SAW MANY ANTIQUE OBJECTS WHICH I DILIGENTLY STUDIED WHENEVER I HAD DAYS OR HOURS FREE FROM THE LABOUR OF THE WORKSHOP
2 MADONNA PORZIA NOW ADVISED ME TO OPEN A SHOP OF MY OWN
I APPROACHED AND HE EXCLAIMED IN ANGER
JULIUS CæSAR HAD AMONG HIS CAPTAINS A MAN OF HIGHEST RANK AND VALOUR WHO WAS CALLED FIORINO OF CELLINO WHICH IS A VILLAGE ABOUT TWO MILES DISTANT FROM MONTE FIASCONE
WE WERE ONE DAY DISTANT FROM LYONS AND IT WAS CLOSE UPON THE HOUR OF TWENTY-TWO WHEN THE HEAVENS BEGAN TO THUNDER WITH SHARP RATTLING CLAPS ALTHOUGH THE SKY WAS QUITE CLEAR AT THE TIME
BUT IT WAS A TASK THAT REQUIRED MUCH TIME
VASARI IN HIS LIFE OF MONTORSOLI SAYS IN EFFECT THAT THIS RICCIO DIED ABOUT 1559 AFTER HAVING BEEN INSANE SEVERAL YEARS
CAPTURED AT PAVIA WITH FRANçOIS
ON MY ASKING WHO IT WAS WHO SPOKE FOR HIM HE SAID IT WAS HIS FATHER
BUT I REMEMBER ONE IN PARTICULAR ON THE DAY OF EPIPHANY WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER NEAR LA MAGLIANA
HE SAID THAT HE WAS COMING ALONE
AND AFTERWARDS I ERECTED TO HIS MEMORY A VERY HANDSOME MONUMENT OF MARBLE UPON WHICH I CAUSED TROPHIES AND BANNERS TO BE CARVED
I HAD NOW DONE FOR EVER WITH THAT DISREPUTABLE CATERINA AND THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN HER HUSBAND HAD DECAMPED FROM PARIS
MY CHIEF PRIDE IS THE COMMENDATION OF THOSE ABLE MEN WHO BOTH UNDERSTAND AND PRACTISE THE ARTS OF DESIGN--AS IN PARTICULAR BRONZINO THE PAINTER
SO FOR HEAVENS SAKE LIFT ME QUICKLY AND I WILL GIVE YOU A CROWN OF GOLD. SAYING THIS I CLAPPED MY HAND TO MY PURSE WHERE I HAD A GOOD QUANTITY
AND THOUGH YOU HAVE FLUNG WORDS AT US WHICH WE ARE FAR FROM DESERVING WE DO NOT MEAN ON THAT ACCOUNT TO GET INTO A RAGE WITH YOU. THEREUPON OLD NARDI SAID THAT I HAD SPOKEN LIKE A WORTHY YOUNG MAN AS I WAS
IN THAT CASE I WILL NOT COME WHOEVER CALLS ME
THEN WE MADE PEACE AND I RETURNED TO MY SHOP WHERE I COULD NOT STAY AN HOUR WITHOUT THAT NEAPOLITAN NOBLEMAN EITHER COMING TO SEE ME OR SENDING FOR ME
WITH HER FOR MODEL I GAVE PERFECT FINISH TO THE BRONZE FONTAINEBLEAU AND ALSO TO THE TWO VICTORIES
XCVII WE REACHED A TOWN BEYOND VESSA WHERE WE PASSED THE NIGHT AND HEARD A WATCHMAN THROUGH ALL THE HOURS SINGING VERY AGREEABLY
ONE DAY MY BROTHER WENT AFTER DINNER TO THE SHOP OF A MAN CALLED BACCINO DELLA CROCE IN THE BANCHI WHICH ALL THOSE MEN-AT-ARMS FREQUENTED
THEN I DEPARTED GLAD AT HEART AND IN HIGH SPIRITS
IT IS THAT I ONCE BEHELD A PIECE OF SILVER ANTIQUE OF SUCH BEAUTY AND SUCH FINISH THAT THE HUMAN IMAGINATION CANNOT POSSIBLY CONCEIVE ITS RARITY
IF YOUR EXCELLENCY POSSESSED THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRAFT WHICH YOU AFFIRM YOU HAVE YOU WOULD NOT FEAR ONE MOMENT FOR THE SPLENDID HEAD YOU SPEAK OF
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
C LEAVING FERRARA IN THE MORNING I WENT TO SANTA MARIA AT LORETO
ANELLO DEL GRANCHIO A METAL RING OF LEAD AND COPPER SUCH AS ARE NOW WORN IN ITALY UNDER THE NAME OF ANELLO DI SALUTE VIII MEANWHILE MESSER ALBERTO RETURNED TO REASON AND PROVIDED ME WITH ALL I HAD DEMANDED
ON THIS ACCOUNT I SHOULD LIKE TO REGAIN MY FOOTING IN THE FAIR CITY OF ROME WHICH WOULD NOT PREVENT MY ATTENDING TO HIS MEDAL
AND YET I HAD EATEN TWO MODERATE MOUTHFULS OF THAT SAUCE BECAUSE IT WAS SO TASTEFUL
HONEST AND READY TO BELIEVE WHAT PEOPLE TOLD HIM
AFTERWARDS HE SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO SPEND FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DAYS AT SAN GERMANO DEL AIA 3 A PLACE TWELVE LEAGUES DISTANT FROM PARIS
HE SPOKE VERY KINDLY TO ME BIDDING ME BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION
WHEREFORE I HAD NOT THE HEART TO LIVE OR DIE TILL I HAD PURGED MYSELF OF THAT INFAMY AND FOUND OUT WHO THE AUDACIOUS RASCAL WAS WHO HAD UTTERED SUCH CALUMNIES AGAINST ME
TILL AT LAST I GAVE HIM THREE DAYS NOTICE TO QUIT
BUONARROTI HE WAS NOT POPULAR OWING TO HIS PRIDE OF PLACE
THE PLACE FROM WHICH I MADE MY EXIT IS ONE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
TO-MORROW WITHOUT FAIL I MEAN TO DESPATCH YOUR BUSINESS
HE SAID TO ME
TO WHICH I ANSWERED THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL FLYING CREATURES AND WISHING TO IMITATE BY ART WHAT THEY DERIVED FROM NATURE NONE WAS SO APT A MODEL AS THE BAT
HE WAS A FAMOUS SURGEON UNDER SEVERAL POPES UNTIL THE YEAR 1566 WHEN HE DIED AT ROME AGE SEVENTY-FIVE
SUCH MEN NEVER FAIL TO GAIN HIS PROTECTION--THAT ABOUT THIS TIME A CERTAIN RASCAL FROM VECCHIO CALLED PIERMARIA DANTERIGOLI AND SURNAMED LO SBIETTA INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO ME
THE OTHER WAS THAT I HAD SEVERAL JOURNEYMEN WHO IN MY ABSENCE WERE UP TO TWO KINDS OF MISCHIEF
AND I DID NOT TURN AT THEIR APPROACH BUT WENT ON PAYING MY ORISONS BEFORE A GOD THE FATHER SURROUNDED WITH ANGELS AND A CHRIST ARISING VICTORIOUS FROM THE GRAVE WHICH I HAD SKETCHED UPON THE WALL WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF CHARCOAL I HAD FOUND COVERED UP WITH EARTH
ON THE MONEY BEING COUNTED I PUT IT ALL INTO MY LITTLE BASKET AND THEN THRUST MY ARM THROUGH THE TWO HANDLES
I ASKED LATTANZIO WHY HE DID NOT PAY ME AS USUAL
AND TAKING TO MY BED I MADE MY MIND UP THAT I WAS SURE TO DIE
IT WAS A LARGE GOLDEN MEDAL TO WEAR IN THE HAT
UPON MY BENDED KNEES I THEN BESOUGHT HIM TO GIVE ME THE PARDON OF HIS BLESSING FOR THAT HOMICIDE
I HAD A FOWLING-PIECE WHICH I HAD MADE MYSELF
AND THIS HE WAS WELL ABLE TO DO SINCE HE GAINED MORE THAN EIGHT THROUGH ME
ON ARRIVING AT VENICE AND PONDERING UPON THE DIVERS WAYS MY CRUEL FORTUNE TOOK TO TORMENT ME YET AT THE SAME TIME FEELING MYSELF NONE THE LESS SOUND IN HEALTH AND HEARTY I MADE UP MY MIND TO FENCE WITH HER ACCORDING TO MY WONT
AND MESSER LATINO JUVINALE WHO HAD RECEIVED SUCH ORDERS FROM THE POPE USED TO INTRODUCE ME TO HIS HOLINESS
I WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE OF BEING ABLE TO PERFORM FAR MORE THAN I HAD PROMISED FOR HIS EXCELLENCY BUT THAT HE MUST GIVE ME MEANS FOR CARRYING MY WORK OUT ELSE I COULD NOT FULFIL MY UNDERTAKING
AND NO SOONER HAD HE SPOKEN OF THE MODELS THAN THE KING CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE I HAD SET THEM UP
SACRED MAJESTY ACTING FOR THE BEST I HAVE NOT HAD THAT MONEY GIVEN TO BENVENUTO
I RODE OUT ON HIM TO VISIT THE PAINTER ROSSO WHO WAS THEN LIVING IN THE COUNTRY TOWARD CIVITA VECCHIA AT A PLACE OF COUNT ANGUILLARAS CALLED CERVETERA
ALL THE REMAINDER OF MY PROPERTY ARMOUR AND EVERYTHING BESIDES I LEFT TO MY DEAREST FELICE TOGETHER WITH FIFTY GOLDEN DUCATS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BUY MOURNING
BE YOU THE FIRST UPON YOUR WATCH AGAINST FALLING INTO THIS SNARE. THE RASCAL MADE A SIGN OF THE CROSS FROM HIS HEAD TO HIS FEET AND CRIED OUT
THIS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME GREAT HONOUR AND YOU MUCH PROFIT
THEN I HAD THEM RICHLY GILT AND THEY SHOWED LIKE THE FINEST PIECE OF PLATE WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN IN FRANCE
JOHN OF LORRAINE SON OF DUKE RENéE II WHO WAS MADE CARDINAL IN 1518
THE FIRST DAY I SPENT TWO HOURS ON END AT MY MODELLING AND BLOCKED OUT THE FINE HEAD OF THAT EMINENT MAN WITH SO MUCH GRACE OF MANNER THAT HIS LORDSHIP WAS FAIRLY ASTOUNDED
MY THINGS ARE BUT A FEW HUNDRED CROWNS AND I AM IN NO FEAR WHATEVER IF ONLY I GET GODS PROTECTION. THEN BUSBACCA CRIED OUT
HE CAN THEN EXECUTE THE BETTER OF THE TWO DESIGNS. FEDERIGO GINORI CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE WANTED ADDING THERETO HOW MICHEL AGNOLO HAD PRAISED ME AND HOW HE HAD SUGGESTED I SHOULD MAKE A WAXEN MODEL WHILE HE UNDERTOOK TO SUPPLY A SKETCH
THEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO S
KEEP PEACE SATAN BEGONE AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE. THESE WORDS IN THE FRENCH TONGUE SOUND AS FOLLOWS
MY NATURAL TEMPERAMENT WAS MELANCHOLY AND WHILE I WAS TAKING THESE AMUSEMENTS MY HEART LEAPT UP WITH JOY AND I FOUND THAT I COULD WORK BETTER AND WITH FAR GREATER MASTERY THAN WHEN I SPENT MY WHOLE TIME IN STUDY AND MANUAL LABOUR
KEEP A GOOD WATCH OVER ME FOR I AM RESOLVED BY ALL MEANS TO ESCAPE. THESE WORDS BRED A GREAT ENMITY BETWEEN HIM AND ME SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO USE PRECAUTIONS TO CONCEAL MY TOOLS THAT IS TO SAY MY PINCERS AND A GREAT BIG PONIARD AND OTHER APPURTENANCES
YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE. AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
NOBODY CAN COMMAND ME FURTHER THAN THAT I SHOULD RETURN THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS WHICH I HAVE HAD
SUCH AT LEAST IS THE LEGEND OF HIS END
AND IN EVERY LETTER BADE ME NOT TO LOSE THE MUSIC HE HAD TAUGHT ME WITH SUCH TROUBLE
FROM WHAT I LEARNED THIS MESSER ANTONIO RECEIVED COMMISSION FROM THE POPE TO LET ME OCCUPY THAT COMMODIOUS PRISON UNTIL HE HAD DECIDED WHAT TO DO WITH ME
BUT BEING A MAN ALSO I HAVE USED HER FOR MY PLEASURES AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE MAY BEAR ME A CHILD
I SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM AND THE DUKE. 8 I REPLIED THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG TOWARD US SINCE WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM OR HIS AFFAIRS
THEY SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT DEPTH OF WATER FOR THE BOAT AND THERE WERE SHOALS THERE WHICH WOULD MAKE IT GO TO PIECES AND DROWN US ALL
6 TRIBOLO AND I KEPT AT A DISTANCE IN ORDER TO AVOID SPEAKING WITH THEM
FURTHERMORE I KEPT HER FOR HOURS TOGETHER IN POSITION GREATLY TO HER DISCOMFORT
HE GAVE ME A MOST GRACIOUS RECEPTION AS DID ALSO THE DUCHESS
THE LITTLE HOUSE I HAD IN STRADA GIULIA WAS NOT READY
OF THE WAX WHICH I USED THE FRIAR STOLE A PIECE
GOD SEND MISCHIEF TO ALL COURTESANS AND SUCH AS FAVOUR THEM! THEN HE SET SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND MADE OFF AS THOUGH HE WAS RESOLVED TO LEAVE US
THEY WANTED TO RIVAL ME
STEFANO COLONNA OF THE PRINCELY HOUSE OF PALESTRINA
YOU KNOW LESS ABOUT SUCH MATTERS THAN I DO
SO HE BEGGED HIM TO COME IN AND SEE HIS STUDY
BUT AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO SOME GENTLEMEN ATTENDING HIM AND SAID
IF I WANTED TO PRESERVE THE REPUTATION FOR HONESTY WHICH I HAD HITHERTO ENJOYED IT WAS MY PLAIN DUTY AFTER LEAVING FRANCE WITH NO CAUSE WHATSOEVER TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT I HAD DONE AND DEALT WITH FOR HIS MAJESTY
1 WHEN I REACHED HIM AND THE PROCURATOR-FISCAL WAS WITH HIM BOTH WAITING FOR ME THE POPES CHAMBERLAINS STILL LAUGHING SAID TO THE GOVERNOR
I ANSWERED THAT MY HEART HAD NEVER MOVED ONE INCH FROM HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY ALTHOUGH SOME WEIGHTY REASONS HAD FORCED ME TO GO A ROAMING FOR A LITTLE WHILE
THE BISHOP IN REPLY ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK WITH ME ON SOME MATTERS OF HIS PATRON WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR
AT THE SAME TIME ANGUILLOTTO WAS ALSO HIT IN THE RIGHT ARM AND BEING UNABLE TO USE HIS SWORD GOT OUT OF THE FRAY AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE
IS THAT THE MAN WHO FELT THAT HE WAS DYING
THIS THEREFORE HAPPENED
WHAT GREAT THINGS HE HAD ATTEMPTED AND AGAINST WHAT ODDS HE HAD CARRIED THEM THROUGH
MY FATHER IN THE MEANWHILE KEPT WRITING PITEOUS ENTREATIES THAT I SHOULD RETURN TO HIM
WHICH CAUSED THE ONLOOKERS WHO HAD FIXED THEIR EYES ON ME WITH SOME DERISION TO TURN ROUND SUDDENLY TO HIM AND SAY
EACH HOUR WHEN THE WATCHMAN SANG HE CALLED OUT IN HIS SLEEP
THIS MADE ME CRY OUT FOR AID BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO FLING ME UNDER HATCHES IN HIS HIDEOUS BOAT
I GAVE ALL THE COLOUR OF TRUTH I COULD TO MY LIES CONFIDING IN THE PROMISE OF THE DUCHESS TO HELP ME AT THE TIME OF NEED
BY GODS MEANS I SHALL AID MYSELF ALONE
IT HAPPENED THAT MY VEINS WERE SWOLLEN FAR BEYOND THEIR USUAL SIZE AND HE TOO WISHED TO MAKE A PRETTY WIDE INCISION
I WENT TO HIS MAJESTY WITH THE CUP AND BASIN
THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS THE POPE DIED AND I WAS LEFT WITH ALL MY LABOUR LOST
BY WAY OF APOLOGY THE CARDINAL TOLD HIM THAT I WAS STAYING SLIGHTLY INDISPOSED IN HIS ABBEY AT LYONS BUT THAT HE WOULD HAVE ME BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO HIS MAJESTY
WE WENT TOGETHER TO THE COLISEUM
I DID NOT EXPECT YOU FOR EIGHT DAYS AT LEAST. I ANSWERED
AND OBSERVING THAT I WAS VERY ILL PLEASED WITH THIS HE SAID TO ME
WHETHER THEY WERE POPES EMPERORS OR KINGS I SHOULD PREFER TO SERVE HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY FOR A HALFPENNY THAN ANY OF THE REST OF THEM FOR A DUCAT
3 I REPLIED THAT I SHOULD GET OUT IN SPITE OF THEM ALL
YOU WILL EASILY BE ABLE TO DRIVE BACK THE TWO PLUGS WITH THIS PAIR OF IRON CROOKS
I SHOULD LIKE THE DUKE TO BUY THEM FOR ME
I WENT AT ONCE TO THE PALACE TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE DUKE WHOM I FOUND TO BE AT CASTELLO BEYOND PONTE A RIFREDI
ANGELO WHERE THEY FORCED HIM TO AGREE TO TERMS FAVOURING THE IMPERIAL CAUSE
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION HOWEVER THAT YOUR MAJESTY HAD GIVEN ME SILVER FOR ONE STATUE ONLY
FRANCESCO WHEN I REACHED HIM RECOGNISED ME AT ONCE AND GAVE ME WORK TO DO WHILE THUS OCCUPIED HE PLACED A HOUSE AT MY DISPOSAL FOR THE WHOLE TIME OF MY SOJOURN IN SIENA
I TOLD HER TO PUT IT TO MY LIPS ADDING THAT IF SHE LET ME TAKE A DRAUGHT ACCORDING TO MY HEARTS CONTENT I WOULD GIVE HER A NEW GOWN
ILL COME MAY YOU BE! 1 I ANSWERED
ON ASKING WHO HAD SENT IT THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BANDINELLO AND THAT THIS WAS THE VERY BLOCK WHICH HE HAD PROMISED
NEVERTHELESS I ACCOMMODATED MYSELF TO THESE NEW TROUBLES ALSO
SO THIS IS THE FINE JUSTICE DEALT OUT HERE IN ROME BY GODS VICAR
I DID SO THIS VERY NIGHT. HE ANSWERED
I REFUSED
MY SON GIOVANNI IS THE STOUTEST YOUTH OF FLORENCE AND OF ALL ITALY TO BOOT AND IF I HAD WANTED EARLIER TO HAVE HIM MARRIED I COULD HAVE PROCURED ONE OF THE LARGEST DOWRIES WHICH FOLK OF OUR RANK GET IN FLORENCE: WHEREUPON STEFANO ANSWERED
IT WAS GIVEN BY THE GRAND DUKE FRANCESCO IN 1576 TO PHILIP II WHO PLACED IT IN THE ESCORIAL WHERE IT NOW IS
I MEANWHILE LOST NO OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING EVERYTHING I COULD IN THE INTERESTS OF ART
THE POPE MEANWHILE SENT MY BOOK TO THE EMPEROR BY THE HAND OF HIS GRANDSON SIGNOR SFORZA
UPON BEHOLDING IT THE KING WAS STRUCK WITH STUPEFACTION AND QUITE LOST HIS CUE FOR REPRIMANDING ME AS HE HAD PROMISED MADAME DETAMPES
TAKING BETTER THOUGHT THAN I HAD DONE OF THE WHOLE SITUATION I NOW TURNED ALL MY FIVE PIECES OF ARTILLERY DIRECTLY ON THE GABIONS AND WAITED TILL THE EVENING HOUR WHEN THEY CHANGED GUARD
BUT I HAD A BETTER CONSTITUTION
XIX ABOUT THIS TIME THE ILLUSTRIOUS SOLDIER PIERO STROZZI ARRIVED IN FRANCE AND REMINDED THE KING THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIM LETTERS OF NATURALISATION
SINCE THE KING WANTS HIM TO BE TRIED GO AND GIVE HIM THREE DAYS TO PREPARE HIS DEFENCE! SO THEY CAME AND EXECUTED THE COMMISSION WHICH THE POPE HAD GIVEN THEM
1 THIS WAS IN SILVER AND IT GAVE SO MUCH SATISFACTION THAT THE DUKE DID NOT HESITATE TO SAY THEY WERE THE BEST PIECES OF MONEY IN CHRISTENDOM
PILOTO OF WHOM WE SHALL HEAR MORE HEREAFTER WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE FLORENTINE SOCIETY OF ARTISTS AND A CELEBRATED PRACTICAL JOKER
WHILE SHE AND THE MOTHER AND ALL THE FAMILY LIVED ON IN A BAD HUMOUR WITH ME
THERE HE PROVIDED ME WITH ALL THINGS NECESSARY FOR MY WORK
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I PERCEIVED IN ME A GREAT AMENDMENT
BEING PREPARED I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED
SECONDLY THE PROCURATOR-FISCAL WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN
AT THIS SEASON HE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS A BAT AND WHEN HE WENT ABROAD TO TAKE THE AIR HE USED TO SCREAM LIKE BATS IN A HIGH THIN TONE
SEE P
SEE P
SEE P
FIRST SECRETARY OR GRAND CHANCELLOR 1546
WHEN WE CAME TO OUR QUARTERS I FOUND PAGOLO AND ASCANIO THERE
FEELING CONFIDENT THEN THAT I COULD RELY UPON THEM I NEXT TURNED TO MY FURNACE WHICH I HAD FILLED WITH NUMEROUS PIGS OF COPPER AND OTHER BRONZE STUFF
NOW WE TELL YOU FRANKLY THAT YOU MUST FIND THE JEWELS OR THEIR VALUE IN MONEY
SEE WHETHER BENVENUTO WILL GIVE IT UP
HE WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE BORE THE NAME OF PAULINO AND WAS SON TO A ROMAN BURGESS WHO LIVED UPON THE INCOME OF HIS PROPERTY
585
585
WE OBSERVED LARGE QUANTITIES OF HAILSTONES WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN GRASPED WITH TWO HANDS
THIS CAME OF MY SLAVERY TO THAT ACCURSED MUSIC
THE DAY WAS WELL-NIGH SPENT FOR THE CLOCKS STRUCK TWENTY-TWO AND THE WATER WENT ON RISING FORMIDABLY
SHE WAS A VERY FINE WOMAN BUT ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE
THE SCENE IS MAINLY IN ITALY AND FRANCE
I HAD TO STRAIN EVERY MUSCLE NIGHT AND DAY
O GOD
AT LAST NOTICING THAT I DID NOT TREAT HER WITH THE SAME CONSIDERATION AS BEFORE HER MARRIAGE SHE BEGAN TO GRUMBLE AND TALK BIG IN HER FRENCH WAY ABOUT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS NOW SERVING THE PRIOR OF CAPUA A BROTHER OF PIERO STROZZI
XXXVII AT THAT TIME BOLOGNA THE PAINTER SUGGESTED TO THE KING THAT IT WOULD BE WELL IF HIS MAJESTY SENT HIM TO ROME WITH LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION TO THE END THAT HE MIGHT CAST THE FOREMOST MASTERPIECES OF ANTIQUITY NAMELY THE LAOCOON THE CLEOPATRA THE VENUS THE COMMODUS THE ZINGARA AND THE APOLLO
AND BEAR THIS WELL IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE REPORTED THESE WORDS TO HIS HOLINESS YOU NEVER IN ANY WAY WHATEVER MEDDLE WITH THE LEAST OF MY AFFAIRS FOR I WILL MAKE YOU RECOGNISE YOUR ERRORS BY THE PUNISHMENT THEY MERIT. THE FELLOW RELATED EVERYTHING TO THE POPE BUT IN FAR MORE BRUTAL TERMS THAN I HAD USED
NOW THE POPE WAS A MAN OF GREAT TALENT FOR AFFAIRS AND HE WANTED TO TALK AT HIS EASE WITH THE CARDINAL ABOUT FRENCH POLITICS
HIS BAPTISMAL NAME WAS BERNARDO
MY FRIEND THE COW AND THE CALF ALL FLED
ALL THROUGH HIS LIFE TRIBOLO SERVED THE MEDICI AND DURING THE SIEGE OF FLORENCE IN 1530 HE CONSTRUCTED A CORK MODEL OF THE TOWN FOR CLEMENT VII
BUT AS THE SAYING GOES KNOCKS ARE NOT DEALT BY MEASURE
I AM CONFIDENT OF BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE A WORK WHICH WILL DELIGHT YOUR SOUL
THE PIECES WERE PILED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF ART THAT IS TO SAY SO RESTING ONE UPON THE OTHER THAT THE FLAMES COULD PLAY FREELY THROUGH THEM IN ORDER THAT THE METAL MIGHT HEAT AND LIQUEFY THE SOONER
HIS HOLINESS THEN BEGAN TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT THE MEDALS AND ASKED WHAT METHOD I HAD USED TO STAMP THEM SO MARVELOUSLY LARGE AS THEY WERE
THIS AFFAIR WAS PRESENTLY FORGOTTEN
ASSUREDLY WE SHALL HEAR TO-MORROW THAT SOMETHING OF VAST IMPORTANCE HAS HAPPENED IN FLORENCE. AS WE RODE INTO ROME THE DARKNESS WAS EXTREME
ONLY FOR SO SHORT A SPACE OF TIME COULD I READ
THIS WAS BECAUSE THE POPE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT THE DIAMOND HAD BEEN SET BY THE FIRST JEWELLER OF THE WORLD IN VENICE
THE DOCTORS WOULD NOT CALL IT THE FRENCH DISEASE ALBEIT I TOLD THEM WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS THAT
THIS WOKE ME UP AND I CALLED OUT
HE WOULD SEE THAT I OBTAINED IT
AND HAVING MADE ONE OF HER WAITING-MAIDS BRING A LILY OF THE FINEST DIAMONDS SET IN GOLD SHE SHOWED IT TO ME AND BADE ME VALUE IT
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT FOLK WHEN THEY ARE FEASTING TOGETHER SAY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD OTHERWISE RETAIN
THE VIRTUE OF GOD HATH DEIGNED TO SHOW ME ALL HIS GLORY THE WHICH PERCHANCE NO MORTAL EYE HATH EVER SEEN BEFORE
THEN ALL TOO HEEDLESSLY I DEMONSTRATED THE FACILITY WITH WHICH MY ASSERTIONS COULD BE CARRIED INTO ACT
PRINCE I MUST TALK TO YOU ABOUT THINGS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE WHICH I HAVE TO DISCLOSE. SO I FOLLOWED HIM TO THE PALACE AND WHEN WE WERE THERE HE TOOK ME PRIVATELY INTO A CHAMBER WHERE WE STAYED A WHILE ALONE TOGETHER
MANY OF THE HERDSMEN HAD ALSO BEEN KILLED
POPE CLEMENT UPON THIS HAD THE CASTLE SEARCHED TO FIND AND HANG THE MAN WHO DID IT
YET WERE YOU ACTIVE FROM YOUR MOTHERS WOMB
MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS THE TROOPS WHO POURED INTO ROME THAT MORNING AND WERE MARCHING STRAIGHT UPON THE CASTLE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE ENTERED IT WITH EASE BECAUSE THE ARTILLERY WAS DOING THEM NO DAMAGE
AND THE OTHER YOUTH WITH WHOM THE QUARREL BEGAN WAS ALSO SENT AWAY
I HAD DESIGNED THE FINEST HEAD IMAGINABLE
AT THE END OF THREE DAYS NEWS WAS BROUGHT ME THAT MY ONLY SON HAD BEEN SMOTHERED BY HIS NURSE MY GOSSIP WHICH GAVE ME GREATER GRIEF THAN I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE
COME FORWARD I BEG AND LET ME HAVE A PRIEST IN ORDER THAT I MAY SPEAK A COUPLE OF WORDS WITH HIM
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT IF YOU DO NOT SEND THE MARBLE TO MY HOUSE YOU HAD BETTER LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER WORLD FOR IF YOU STAY UPON THIS EARTH I WILL MOST CERTAINLY RIP THE WIND OUT OF YOUR CARCASS
I ONLY CRAVE OF YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK
HE WAS THE MOST LOYAL FRIEND THE WISEST THE MOST WORTHY THE MOST DISCREET THE MOST AFFECTIONATE THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN
THIS FAMOUS MASTERPIECE WAS PRESERVED IN THE CASTLE OF S
UPON THIS I WANT YOU TO REPRESENT A GOD THE FATHER IN HALF-RELIEF AND IN THE MIDDLE TO SET THAT MAGNIFICENT BIG DIAMOND WHICH YOU REMEMBER TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER GEMS OF THE GREATEST VALUE
THEY ARE ALL THE SAME IN THIS RESPECT
I ENGRAVED UPON IT LEDA WITH HER SWAN
HE WAS VERY UGLY AND HIS MOUTH WHICH NATURE HAD MADE LARGE HAD BEEN EXPANDED AT LEAST THREE INCHES BY HIS WOUND
LEFT ALONE THERE WITH MY POOR LITTLE PRENTICE WHO REFUSED TO ABANDON ME I FELT STIFLED AT THE HEART AND MADE UP MY MIND FOR CERTAIN I WAS A DEAD MAN
I DO NOT CHOOSE TO BUY THEM
I THEREFORE NOT DISCERNING THAT HE WAS MORE A MERCHANT THAN A DUKE DEALT VERY FRANKLY WITH HIS EXCELLENCY JUST AS IF I HAD TO DO WITH A PRINCE AND NOT WITH A COMMERCIAL MAN
THEREFORE I BEG YOU TO TELL ME WHAT IT REALLY IS YOU WANT OF ME AND TO LET ME HEAR FROM YOUR LIPS REASONABLE SPEECH AND NOT JABBERINGS OR NONSENSE. IN REPLY TO THESE WORDS OF MINE THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS A PISTOJAN COULD NO LONGER DISGUISE HIS FURIOUS TEMPER AND BEGAN
ON SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED I SET OFF RUNNING AT FULL SPEED SCRAMBLED WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY ON TO THE ROCK AND DANGLING OVER FROM IT SEIZED THE SKIRT OF THE SCRIVENERS GOWN AND PULLED HIM UP FOR HE WAS STILL SUBMERGED BENEATH THE SURFACE
BUT I KEPT ON SAYING THE SAME THING
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY STRENGTH WAS RECOVERED I ADVANCED QUICKLY TOWARD THE LAST RAMPART WHICH FACES TOWARD PRATI
SHE AFTERWARDS SENT THE RING AS A PRESENT TO KING PHILIP AND FROM THAT TIME FORWARD KEPT CHARGING ME WITH COMMISSIONS SO KINDLY HOWEVER THAT I DID MY BEST TO SERVE HER ALTHOUGH I SAW BUT VERY LITTLE OF HER MONEY
2 I SUGGESTED SEVERAL IDEAS AND HIS MAJESTY EXPRESSED HIS OWN OPINION
THE PEASANTS ALSO OF THAT DISTRICT ARE PEOPLE TO BE TRUSTED AND HAVE SOME PRACTICE IN THESE MATTERS SO THAT AT A PINCH THEY ARE ABLE TO RENDER VALUABLE ASSISTANCE
HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND YOU SHALL HAVE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE WEALTH THAN YOU DESIRE. NOT BEING ALLOWED TO SPEAK I WRITHED MY BODY IN A RAGE
MY COUNSEL THEREFORE IS THAT YOU SHOULD BUY THEM FOR THEY ARE IN GOOD SOOTH MIRACULOUS. HE RESPONDED ON THE INSTANT
GERMAIN-EN-LAYE I TOOK THE HANDSOME LITTLE VASE WHICH I HAD MADE AT THE REQUEST OF MADAME DETAMPES HOPING IF I GAVE IT HER TO RECOVER THE FAVOUR I HAD LOST
I SET THE HIGHEST VALUE ON THE EULOGIES OF THAT EXCELLENT PAINTER JACOPO PONTORMO AND STILL MORE ON THOSE OF HIS ABLE PUPIL BRONZINO WHO WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MERELY PUBLISHING HIS VERSES BUT SENT THEM BY HIS LAD SANDRINOS HAND TO MY OWN HOUSE
FOR WE WISH TO COMPLY WITH BENVENUTOS REQUEST. 2 I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD SECURE ME IN POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE
I WILL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING OF MY HOUSEHOLD UP TO VIRTUOUS HONESTY
HE LAY THERE LIKE A DEAD MAN
PASQUALINO DANCONA THE GATE AT SAN PIER GATTOLINI
AND HE SWORE WITH PASSION THAT HE WOULD NEVER SHOW HIS FACE TO ME AGAIN
THE DUKE OF MELFI OR AMALFI WAS AT THIS TIME ALFONSO PICCOLOMINI ACTING AS CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF THE SIENESE IN THE INTERESTS OF CHARLES V
THERE ARE MANY THINGS BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH IN WORDS WHICH DO NOT MATCH TOGETHER WELL WHEN EXECUTED BY AN ARTIST. THEN I TURNED TO THE TWO SCHOLARS AND SAID
TAKE WITH THEM YOUR DISCHARGE AND GO WHERE YOU LIKE. DON DIEGO STOOD ASTONISHED AT THIS WHICH WAS QUITE THE CONTRARY OF WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED
YOU SAW WELL ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR WAY HITHER AND I DONT BELIEVE ONE WORD OF WHAT YOU SAY. I ANSWERED FOR I NOTICED HE HAD DROPPED HIS VOICE A LITTLE
IT IS MY INTENTION TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER COMMISSION WHICH IF YOU FEEL COMPETENT TO EXECUTE IT I SHALL HAVE NO LESS AT HEART THAN THIS OR MORE. HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE WISHED TO MAKE DIES FOR THE COINAGE OF HIS REALM AND ASKED ME IF I HAD EVER TRIED MY HAND AT SUCH THINGS AND IF I HAD THE COURAGE TO ATTEMPT THEM
SO I CAST MY EYES AROUND THE PRISON AND SAW SOME SCRAPS OF ROTTEN BRICK WITH THE FRAGMENTS OF WHICH RUBBING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER I COMPOSED A PASTE
AND ON THE WAY I ENTERED INTO CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WHO HAD NOT AT THAT PERIOD OBTAINED THE HAT
HE WAS IN THE HOTTEST RAGE IMAGINABLE AND BADE ME COME UPON THE INSTANT WITH MY PIECE
THEY HAD WITH THEM A YOUNG WOMAN OF QUALITY THE LOVELIEST I EVER SAW
THIS YOUNG MAN GAVE HIS TIME TO LATIN STUDIES AND WAS VERY DILIGENT IN THEIR PURSUIT
AND FROM THOSE ADVERSITIES I AM NOW MORE FREE THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS PERIOD OF MY CAREER-NAY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I ENJOY GREATER CONTENT OF SOUL AND HEALTH OF BODY THAN EVER I DID IN BYGONE YEARS
IN A LOW VOICE HE CALLED OUT TO ME
HAD I SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES SCOUNDREL WHAT YOUR BEHAVIOUR AND APPEARANCE FORCE ME TO BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE RUN YOU WITH THIS SWORD HERE TEN TIMES THROUGH THE GUTS
BENVENUTOS ABILITY IN HIS PROFESSION IS KNOWN TO THE WHOLE WORLD
BEGINNING WITH THE LESS IMPORTANT I POINTED OUT A QUANTITY OF THINGS IN BRONZE
IV I BOUGHT A NEW PAIR OF STIRRUPS ALTHOUGH I STILL HOPED TO REGAIN MY GOOD PAD BY PERSUASION
THOSE FRENCH MASTERS UNDERTAKING THE JUPITER WHILE I LOOKED AFTER MY TWO HEADS
THEY FILLED ME WITH SOME UNEASINESS BECAUSE THAT DISTRICT IS INFESTED WITH A RACE OF BRIGANDS WHO BEAR THE NAME OF VENTURERS AND ARE APT TO MURDER MEN UPON THE ROAD
IT WAS INDEED GODS GRACE TO ME THAT I SHOULD THUS IN MY POOR STATION BE ABLE TO RENDER SERVICES TO MEN OF GREAT POSITION AND ACQUIREMENTS
IN THE TRADE OF THE GOLDSMITHS IT ROUSED CONSIDERABLE JEALOUSY AMONG THOSE WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF MATCHING IT
HE HOWEVER ADVISED ME NOT TO BE IN SUCH A HURRY FOR IT MIGHT TURN OUT PERHAPS THAT THE EVIL WAS NOT SO GREAT AS I IMAGINED
SO THAT THE POPE FORBADE ANY ONE ELSE TO SPEAK TO HIM OF COINS SINCE HE WISHED ME ONLY TO HAVE TO DO WITH THEM
THE CAPITOL WAS WHERE IS NOW THE OLD MARKET
A TRIUMPH JUDGED IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE PRACTITIONERS OF THIS ART
OR IF HE BE THE MAN HE CANNOT BE CARRYING ANYTHING. I SPOKE ITALIAN AND KEPT HARRYING THEM WITH THRUST AND SLASH SO HOTLY THAT I NARROWLY MISSED KILLING ONE OR THE OTHER
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY WHEN BENVENUTO IN WHOM YOU PLACE SUCH WELL-MERITED CONFIDENCE HAS TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD BE CHEAP AT OVER THREE THOUSAND CROWNS? THEN THE DUKE SAID
1 THE DUKE UPON BEING INFORMED THAT WE WERE THE CARDINAL OF FERRARAS MEN REFUSED TO GIVE THEM TROOPS OR LEAVE TO FOLLOW
I REMAINED IN ECSTASIES OF ADMIRATION
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT OCCASIONALLY WHILE WALKING NOISELESSLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY THROUGH THE PRIVATE ROOMS I CAME UPON THE DUCHESS AT A HIGHLY INCONVENIENT MOMENT
THE NECKLACE IS NOT THE SORT OF THING FOR ME. AT THESE WORDS THE DUCHESS CAST A GLANCE OF BITTER SPITE AT ME AND RETIRED WITH A THREATENING NOD OF HER HEAD IN MY DIRECTION
TALKING THUS AND WALKING ONWARDS WE FOUND OURSELVES AT THE GATE SAN PIERO GATTOLINI WITHOUT NOTICING THAT WE HAD GOT THERE
BROTHER NOW THAT THE MISCHIEFS DONE WE MUST SEE TO SAVING YOU. I REPLIED
DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS AND SAPPHIRES ON THE CONTRARY NEVER GROW OLD
2 THE FIRST THING WHICH THIS MAN DID WAS TO LOOK OUT THE BEST APARTMENTS IN THE CASTLE AND TO HAVE THEM FITTED UP FOR HIMSELF
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER WHEN IT BEGAN TO DRAW TOWARD SUNDOWN A SUSPICION CAME INTO MY HEAD AND I RECOLLECTED THE WORDS WHICH THAT TRAITOR HAD SPOKEN WITH HIS FEIGNED SIMPLICITY
AND I TELL YOU THAT DURING THE LAST THOUSAND YEARS THERE HAS NOT BEEN BORN A MAN CAPABLE OF SO MUCH AS COPYING THEM. I THEN NOT CARING TO DEPRIVE THEM OF SO EMINENT A REPUTATION KEPT SILENCE AND ADMIRED THEM WITH MUTE STUPEFACTION
ONWARDS
I SETTLED MONEY ENOUGH UPON THE GIRL FOR DOWRY TO SATISFY AN AUNT OF HERS UNDER WHOSE TUTELAGE I PLACED HER AND FROM THAT TIME FORWARDS I HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH HER
IX THE CARDINAL DE MEDICI WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME POPE CLEMENT VII HAD US RECALLED TO FLORENCE AT THE ENTREATY OF MY FATHER
I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT BUT FOR ME THE MORNING WHEN THE IMPERIAL TROOPS ENTERED THE BORGO THEY WOULD WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE HAVE FORCED THEIR WAY INTO THE CASTLE
EITHER I SHALL ESCAPE YOUR HANDS ALIVE OR BE TAKEN A DEAD CORPSE! THE ROOM WAS CRAMMED WITH MEN
ALLUSION TO HIS PREVISION OF PIER LUIGI FARNESES MURDER
ABOUT THIS TIME THE NEW APARTMENTS WERE BUILT TOWARD THE LIONS
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH HIM? ALTHOUGH I REPLIED THAT I WAS EXTREMELY CONTENTED AND WAS VERY WELL TREATED BY HIS EXCELLENCY HE SHOWED THAT HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE GREATER PART OF MY ANNOYANCES AND GAVE AS HIS FINAL ANSWER THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO LEAVE ROME
SO THEN GO BACK TO FLORENCE AND BE UNCONCERNED
AS I HAVE RELATED ABOVE WE SUPPED AT THE EARLY HOUR OF TWENTY BECAUSE I MADE IT KNOWN THAT I MEANT TO RETURN TO TRESPIANO
I HAD MADE IT WITH THE MOST THOROUGH STUDY AND ART
I ASKED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN GENTLE TERMS TO GIVE ME UP MY ROOMS BECAUSE I WANTED TO EMPLOY THEM FOR MY WORK-PEOPLE IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING
WHEN MY ENEMIES PERCEIVED THAT MY SHOP WAS CLOSED THEY LOST NO OPPORTUNITY OF TAUNTING AND REVILING THOSE SERVANTS AND FRIENDS OF MINE WHO CAME TO VISIT ME IN PRISON
INDEED I SHOULD BE MUCH BETTER PLEASED TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH HIM WHO KNOWS SO MUCH THAN WITH THOSE OTHERS WHO KNOW BUT LITTLE OF THEIR ART
AND I ONLY WISH YOU TO REMEMBER THESE FOUR SIMPLE WORDS OBEY THEM AND NEVER LET THEM ESCAPE YOUR MEMORY
I DID NOT MUCH LIKE TO TAKE HIM LEST I SHOULD GET INTO A QUARREL WITH THE SPANIARD AND SAID TO ASCANIO
IN 1565 HE MARRIED PIERA DE SALVADORE PARIGI A SERVANT WHO HAD NURSED HIM WHEN HE WAS SICK
I QUITTED MANTUA WITH A GOOD SUM OF CROWNS AND REACHED GOVERNO WHERE THE MOST VALIANT GENERAL GIOVANNI HAD BEEN KILLED
TWENTY-TWO OCLOCK WAS THEREFORE TWO HOURS BEFORE NIGHTFALL
AND MUCH I MARVELLED THAT A DUKE OF THAT SORT SHOWED SUCH CONFIDENCE ABOUT HIS SAFETY
I PORTRAYED HER IN AN ATTITUDE OF GLADNESS WITH VERY THIN DRAPERY AND BELOW HER FEET LAY FURY IN DESPAIR DOWNCAST AND SAD AND LOADED WITH CHAINS
THE LOGS OF PINE WERE HEAPED IN AND WHAT WITH THE UNCTUOUS RESIN OF THE WOOD AND THE GOOD DRAUGHT I HAD GIVEN MY FURNACE WORKED SO WELL THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO RUSH FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO KEEP IT GOING
I MEANWHILE WAS WAITING AND PUT MY HANDS AMONG THE BREAST-FEATHERS OF THE GEESE AND FELT THEM VERY WARM
PIERO WAS THE SON OF FILIPPO STROZZI AND THE GENERAL WHO LOST THE BATTLE OF MONTEMURLO SO DISASTROUS TO THE FLORENTINE EXILES IN 1537
AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO MANY OTHER STATUES AND DARED EVEN TO ATTACK THE MARVELLOUS DAVID OF DIVINE MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI ACCUSING IT OF ONLY LOOKING WELL IF SEEN IN FRONT
THIS ONE UPON THE RIGHT HAND IS DESIGNED FOR LEARNING
THAT POINT I LEFT ENTIRELY TO THE GOOD JUDGMENT OF HIS EXCELLENCY
AND HE USED FREQUENTLY TO GO AND THANK HIS FORMER MASTER WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS PROSPERITY
IT HAPPENED THAT A LITTLE FRENCH LAD WAS WORKING AT MY SIDE WHO HAD JUST BEEN GUILTY OF SOME TRIFLING BLUNDER
NOW I REVOLVED OTHER PLANS BUT FIRST I RENDERED THANKS TO GOD AND BLESSED POVERTY
I WENT OFF FURIOUS RESOLVED ON LEAVING FLORENCE
ON HEARING THIS THE PRIOR AND MESSER LORENZO TURNED ROUND ON ME WITH SUCH STERNNESS THAT I FELT EXTREMELY UNEASY
BECOMING INSTANTLY AWARE OF WHAT THE THING WAS HE HAD MY SISTER AND ME CALLED AND POINTING IT OUT TO US CHILDREN GAVE ME A GREAT BOX ON THE EARS WHICH CAUSED ME TO HOWL AND WEEP WITH ALL MY MIGHT
THE METAL CAME ALL RIGHT TO MELTING AND WE LET IT IN WITH JOY AND GLADNESS
STILL IF THEY ARE SUCH AS CAN BE CONDONED WE ENTREAT YOU TO PARDON HIM FOR OUR SAKE. THE POPE WHEN HE HEARD THIS FELT SHAME AND ANSWERED
THIS SCULPTOR WAS BORN IN 1511 AND DIED IN 1592
BUT I SAID I WANTED FIRST TO FINISH THE MEDALS I WAS MAKING FOR THE POPE
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU PROMISED HIM THE MARBLE? HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS TRUE
THE SAME SORT OF ADVENTURES HAPPENED IN THIS CASE AS IN THAT OF SALAMANCAS VASE
THE OUTLINES OF HIS HEAD AND FACE WERE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THOSE OF THE ANTIQUE ANTINOUS
MESSER LORENZO HERE WILL GIVE ME SOME EXQUISITE REVERSE AS HE IS A PERSON LEARNED AND OF THE GREATEST GENIUS. TO THESE WORDS LORENZO SUDDENLY MADE ANSWER
OH YOU TOLD US HE WAS DEAD! BOZZA REPLIED
BUT WHEN THE BRUTE HAD BROUGHT HIS DISAGREEABLE BABBLE TO AN END THE DUKE EXCLAIMED
WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED THE DUKE CAME TO MY HOUSE AND OFTEN SAID TO ME
AND BRIDLING MYSELF AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE IN THE WAY HE BADE ME I ANSWERED
I CORRECTED THE PROPORTIONS OF THE DOORWAY AND PLACED ABOVE IT AN EXACT HALF CIRCLE
HE CAME TO ROME AND SPENT SIX MONTHS THERE DURING WHICH HE BEDAUBED SOME SCORES OF NOBLEMAN AND UNFORTUNATE GENTLEFOLK WITH HIS DIRTY SALVES EXTRACTING MANY THOUSANDS OF DUCATS FROM THEIR POCKETS
THE SEAL WAS FINISHED AFTER FOUR MONTHS TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE PIECES I MADE FOR THE DUKE UNDER THE NAME OF THE CARDINAL
TAKE IT MY BENVENUTO! HE EXCLAIMED
LXXII IN THE MEANTIME THE POPE WAS TAKEN ILL AND HIS PHYSICIANS THOUGHT THE CASE WAS DANGEROUS
WHEN I REACHED THE BOAT THE MASTER PRESENTED HIMSELF AND SAID THAT THOSE FLORENTINE GENTLEMEN WANTED TO EMBARK IN IT WITH US IF I WAS WILLING
SUPPOSING THEN I MAKE IT BETTER IT WILL DESERVE TWO BOWS. CERTAINLY SO, SAID HE
LET HIM EEN STAY WHERE HE IS. THUS THE THIEVISH BRIGANDS BROUGHT MATTERS EXACTLY TO THE PASS THEY DESIRED
OFTEN WOULD HE REBUKE AND SCOLD ME AS IT WERE FOR THE GREAT GRIEF IN WHICH MY BROTHERS LOSS HAD PLUNGED ME
NO SOONER DID THE DUCHESS HEAR THAT I WAS ILL THAN SHE CAUSED THE EXECUTION OF THAT UNLUCKY MARBLE TO BE ASSIGNED TO BARTOLOMMEO AMMANATO
SO DRAW YOUR SWORDS AND FORCE THESE FELLOWS TO PUT US ON SHORE. THIS WE DID NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOR THEY OFFERED A STUBBORN RESISTANCE
AND THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
OUR FOLK SENT CRISTOFANO TO FLORENCE
4 I ARRIVED BY GODS GRACE SAFE AND SOUND AT VITERBO WHERE MY COUSINS AND ALL THE CONVENT RECEIVED ME WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS
WHAT THE POPE HAS ORDERED ME, I ANSWERED
IN THE KINGS NAME I PUT THIS MAN HERE INTO POSSESSION OF THAT TENNIS-COURT TOGETHER WITH THE LODGINGS THAT PERTAIN TO IT. TO THIS I ANSWERED
IF YOUR EXCELLENCY PERMITS I SHOULD LIKE TO RESTORE IT--HEAD AND ARMS AND FEET
I MEAN TO KILL THIS FELLOW AT THE FIRST STROKE AND THEN WE WILL DECAMP TOGETHER WITH GODS GRACE. MARMAGNA WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD MY PURPOSE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO GET ALIVE OUT OF THE CASTLE
IT APPEARS FROM SOME PARTICULARS WHICH FOLLOW THAT THE ENTRATE WERE TO BE PAID IN KIND
HE WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN ROSE-COLOUR
NEVERTHELESS I THANK GOD AND YOUR MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP FOR ALL THINGS SEEING GOD HAS EMPLOYED YOU AS THE INSTRUMENT FOR MY GREAT GOOD IN PROCURING MY LIBERATION FROM IMPRISONMENT
3 IT IS INDEED GREAT GLORY FOR ME THAT MY WORKS ARE HELD IN SUCH REPUTE AMONG YOU WEALTHY LORDS
AND IN THIS STATE ALSO THE BREED EXISTS MEN DEVOTED TO THE PROFESSION OF ARMS
HE DID NOT WORK HIMSELF BUT ENTRUSTED ALL HIS COMMISSIONS TO A YOUNG MAN NAMED LUCAGNOLO FROM IESI A COUNTRY FELLOW WHO WHILE YET A CHILD HAD COME INTO SANTIS SERVICE
SO HE BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
THIS MAN SCREAMED OUT THAT HE HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH ME AND PARRIED THE POINT OF THE PARTISAN WITH A LITTLE STICK HE HELD
I WAS WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE THESE FOUR JEWELLERS AMONG WHOM WAS A MAN OF MILAN CALLED GAIO
THEN HE TURNED TO GIULIO BIDDING HIM SUPPLY ME WITH A DESIGN FOR IT
NOW THAT I HAVE SURPASSED MILIANO LET US SEE IF I CAN SURPASS MYSELF. THEN I BEGGED THEM TO WAIT FOR ME A WHILE WENT UP INTO A LITTLE CABINET AND HAVING TINTED THE DIAMOND ANEW UNSEEN BY THEM RETURNED AND SHOWED IT TO THE JEWELLERS
WHEN I REACHED HOME I FOUND MY GOOD FATHER WHO THOUGHT EITHER THAT I MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE SACK OF ROME OR ELSE THAT I SHOULD COME BACK TO HIM A BEGGAR
AND ON THEIR BEDS A LOST WOE-STRICKEN CREW
SINCE I AM HERE I WILL CONSENT TO TREAT YOU
THIS SHOT DID SUCH DAMAGE TO THE ENEMY THAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE MADE THEM EVACUATE THE HOUSE
HE HAD THE SAME REGARD FOR ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN HIS BROTHER
FOR HAVING BEEN OVERWHELMED BY SO MANY EVILS AND SUCH GREAT ANNOYANCES ALL AT ONE FELL SWOOP I FELT MY FORCES FAILING
SHE RAN AT ONCE AND BROUGHT IT TO ME FULL
THE SAID CRISTOFANO TOOK WIFE IN FLORENCE AND HAD SONS AND DAUGHTERS
THE WATER WAS REPRESENTED WITH ITS WAVES AND ENAMELLED IN THE APPROPRIATE COLOUR
HE NEGLECTED HIS FINE TALENTS AND PRETENDED NOT TO SEE OR RECOGNISE ME BECAUSE I HAD ONCE REBUKED HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WAS GIVING HIS SOUL TO FOUL VICES WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM BREAK HIS NECK AS HE HAD VOWED
WHEREUPON THE DUKE ROSE AND RETIRED WITH THE OFFICIAL INTO ANOTHER CHAMBER
PLEASE GO AND FINISH WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH FELICE
NOW THOUGH I CANNOT VAUNT MYSELF OF ANY RECOMPENSE BEYOND THE SALARIES APPOINTED FOR MY MAINTENANCE IN FRANCE SEVEN HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS OF WHICH ARE STILL DUE INASMUCH AS I ABSTAINED FROM DRAWING THEM UNTIL I COULD EMPLOY THEM ON MY RETURN-JOURNEY
THE PETITION AND THE RESCRIPT ARE IN EXISTENCE AND CONFIRM CELLINIS VERACITY IN THIS TRANSACTION
HE IS ROBBING YOU OF IT ONLY THROUGH THE FAVOUR OF MADAME DETAMPES
MOST REVEREND MONSIGNOR YOUR FRIEND BENVENUTO IS DOWN THERE
AND THAT HONEST MASTER OF MINE TOOK MARVELLOUS DELIGHT IN MY PERFORMANCES
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD COME FROM ITALY TO FRANCE ONLY IN ORDER TO SERVE THAT ILLUSTRIOUS KING
BUT I VARIED HIS FEATURES AND SOME OTHER DETAILS
THAT BENVENUTO IS ONE OF THE ARTISTS OF MERIT WHO ENJOYED THE GOODWILL OF MY LATE HUSBAND DUKE ALESSANDRO AND I SHALL ALWAYS HOLD THEM IN MIND IF AN OPPORTUNITY COMES OF DOING SUCH MEN SERVICE. SHE ALSO TALKED OF ME TO DUKE OTTAVIO
AND WHEN HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS HOLINESS BEGAN TO CRY OUT AND TO SAY THAT IF HE DID NOT SEND ME BACK TO PRISON HE WOULD DO HIM A GREAT WRONG
FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PISA WAS THEN IN VACATION AND ALL THE DOCTORS AND SCHOLARS KEPT VYING WITH EACH OTHER WHO COULD PRAISE IT BEST
FOR WHENEVER I SHOWED MY FACE BEFORE HIM HIS LORDSHIP GAVE ME SOME COMMISSION OF IMPORTANCE WHICH HINDERED ME FROM WORKING AT MY MEDAL TO THE END
1 WHY MOST BLESSED FATHER DO YOU CONFIDE GEMS OF THAT VAST VALUE TO A YOUNG FELLOW WHO IS ALL FIRE MORE PASSIONATE FOR ARMS THAN FOR HIS ART AND NOT YET THIRTY YEARS OF AGE? THE POPE ASKED IN ANSWER IF ANY ONE OF THEM KNEW THAT I HAD DONE AUGHT TO JUSTIFY SUCH SUSPICIONS
COMING THUS WITH NOTARIES AND PEOPLE OF THE COURT LOOKS MORE LIKE A FRAUD THAN THE MANDATE OF A POWERFUL MONARCH
FOR THE CARDINAL HAVING GIVEN ME NO ASSISTANCE I WENT TO LIVE WITH A BOLOGNESE ILLUMINATOR WHO WAS CALLED SCIPIONE CAVALLETTI HIS HOUSE WAS IN THE STREET OF OUR LADY DEL BARACCAN
SHE PLEADED MY CAUSE SO WARMLY THAT SHE WOKE THE POPE TO SHAME
SO THAT HE HAD NOT THE SAME ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY THAT I MET WITH IN ESCAPING
YOU DO NOT LIKE MY VICTUALS SINCE YOU EAT SO LITTLE. I ANSWERED BY PRAISING THE SUPPER OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SAYING THAT I HAD NEVER EATEN BETTER OR WITH HEARTIER APPETITE
THE CASTELLAN SENT FOR ME AT ONCE AND I TOLD HIM THE WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS
I RUSHED ONWARD BRANDISHING MY SWORD ALONG THE WALLS WITH FURY AND SHOUTING
ON ONE OCCASION THE POPE WAS WALKING ROUND THE CIRCULAR KEEP 1 WHEN HE OBSERVED A SPANISH COLONEL IN THE PRATI
ONE OF THEM WITH GREAT ADDRESS AND TROUBLE SET HIMSELF TO THE BUSINESS AND PICKED UP ALL THE FELLOWS WRITINGS SO THAT HE LOST NOT ONE OF THEM
HERE I MODELLED THE STATUE IN PLASTER GIVING IT THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS THE BRONZE WAS MEANST TO HAVE AND INTENDING TO CAST IT FROM THIS MOULD
ONE CAN GIVE COMMISSIONS BUT NOT THE PRUDENCE TO PERFORM THEM
YET IN ANOTHER WAY IT GAVE ME MORE THAN IT DEPRIVED ME OF SEEING THAT EACH TIME I WENT OUT SHOOTING I RETURNED WITH GREATLY BETTER HEALTH BECAUSE THE OPEN AIR WAS A BENEFIT TO MY CONSTITUTION
I WILL SEE; BUT HE NEVER SUPPLIED ME WITH CONVENIENCES OR AID OF ANY KIND
THIS MAN WAS SHORT BUT WELL PROPORTIONED AND WAS A MORE SKILFUL CRAFTSMAN THAN ANY ONE WHOM I HAD MET WITH UP TO THAT TIME
OBIIT DIE XXVII MAII MD.XXIX. HE WAS TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE
180
YOU LET YOURSELF BE BLINDED BY MERE CUPIDITY
BUT ITALY HAD NOT YET SEEN WHAT I COULD DO IN SCULPTURE
THE POPE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS OBLIGATION BUT SAID THAT HE TOO WANTED A FAVOUR FROM HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP WHICH WAS THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP BENVENUTO TO HIM
SO THESE TWO CAME OFF UNHURT
ALL THE DISAGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY PRISON HAD BECOME AS IT WERE TO ME FRIENDLY AND COMPANIONABLE
CARDINAL IN 1539
THEREUPON I SAID THAT FRANCESCO HAD BEHAVED BADLY AND LIKE A LOW-BRED FELLOW
BUT AS I WAS INFORMED BY MANY OF HIS COURTIERS WHO HAD HEARD HIM HE COMMENDED MINE FAR ABOVE THE REST
VARCHI GIVES A VERY UGLY ACCOUNT OF THIS MAN FRANCESCO DEL NERO WHO WAS NICKNAMED THE CRà DEL PICCADIGLIO IN HIS HISTORY OF FLORENCE BOOK III
IT WAS SO BIG THAT WHEN I HAD IT IN MY LITTLE HANDS IT PUT OUT ITS TAIL ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER THRUST FORTH BOTH ITS MOUTHS
THE MSS
IF NOT THEY WOULD THEMSELVES DESPATCH A MESSENGER TO GET THEM BACK AND DO ME SOME GREAT MISCHIEF
HE REIGNED AS LEO X THAT GENEROUS AND GREAT SOUL
PROVOKED BY HIS UGLY WORDS I STOOPED AND TOOK UP A LUMP OF MUD-FOR IT HAD RAINED-AND HURLED IT WITH A QUICK AND UNPREMEDITATED MOVEMENT AT HIS FACE
ALTHOUGH I TOOK PLEASURE IN FORTIFYING THE HEALTH I SO MUCH LONGED FOR YET I NEVER LEFT OFF WORKING
HE ANSWERED THAT HE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO DO HIS BEST TO GRATIFY ME IN THIS MATTER
FELICE HAVING USED ALL THE REMEDIES PRESCRIBED BY MAESTRO FRANCESCO AND SEEING THAT I DID NOT COME TO RAN POST-HASTE TO THE PHYSICIANS DOOR AND KNOCKED SO LOUDLY THAT HE WOKE HIM UP AND MADE HIM RISE AND BEGGED HIM WITH TEARS TO COME TO THE HOUSE FOR HE THOUGHT THAT I WAS DEAD
AND UPON THE DAY FOLLOWING I CALLED ON MESSER BACCIO WHO REPORTED WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
THIS MESSER&HELLIP WAS ONE OF THE LOVERS OF BARTOLOMMEO AMMANATOS WIFE
THEREFORE I THINK I AM JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT NO MAN KNOWN UPON THIS EARTH COULD HAVE PRODUCED MY PERSEUS
WITH THIS TO CONSOLE ME I SHALL TAKE MY DEPARTURE ON THE INSTANT WITHOUT RETURNING TO THE HOUSE YOU GAVE ME AND SHALL NEVER SEEK TO SET MY FOOT IN THIS TOWN AGAIN. WE WERE JUST AT S
IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAID THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CHOIR WAS ALTOGETHER INCORRECT WITHOUT PROPORTION ART CONVENIENCE GRACE OR GOOD DESIGN
NOW IT IS MY CUSTOM TO TAKE BUT LITTLE SAUCE OR SEASONING WITH MY MEAT EXCEPTING SALT
AND IT WAS RAINING AS THOUGH THE FOUNTAINS OF THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED
THE FIRST OF YOU WHO BLABS ABOUT THIS AFFAIR WILL BE KILLED UPON THE SPOT
ONLY ONE CLEVER WORD MUST BE MENTIONED FOR IT WAS SPOKEN BY THAT ADMIRABLE PAINTER GIULIO WHO LOOKING ROUND WITH MEANING 4 IN HIS EYES ON THE BYSTANDERS AND FIXING THEM PARTICULARLY UPON THE WOMEN TURNED TO MICHEL AGNOLO AND SAID
OUR LODGING WAS IN AN ABBEY OF THE CARDINALS
MY LORD I SHOULD LIKE TO NARRATE TO YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY A VERY SINGULAR INCIDENT WHICH WILL EXPLAIN WHY I WAS PREVENTED FROM FINISHING THAT CLAY MODEL OF NEPTUNE ON WHICH I WAS WORKING IN THE LOGGIA
DON DIEGO SIR IN ALL YOUR DEALINGS YOU ARE THE MOST LIBERAL AND WORTHY MAN I EVER KNEW BUT THAT FRANCESCO IS QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF YOU
DEAR GENTLEMEN YOU ARE ABLE TO DO US SERIOUS INJURY WHILE WE CANNOT RENDER YOU ANY ASSISTANCE
1 HE HAD NO DISTINCTION OF BIRTH WHATEVER BUT WAS THE SON OF A CHARCOAL-SELLER
THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN TWO CUBITS
FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEMBO WHO RULED OVER ITALIAN LITERATURE LIKE A DICTATOR FROM THE REIGN OF LEO X
AND THERE THE PRIEST HAVING ARRAYED HIMSELF IN NECROMANCERS ROBES BEGAN TO DESCRIBE CIRCLES ON THE EARTH WITH THE FINEST CEREMONIES THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
THE DEMOCRATS IN CELLINIS DAYS WERE CALLED AT FLORENCE ARRABBIATI OR ARROVELLATI IN THE DAYS OF SAVONAROLA THIS NICKNAME HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE ULTRA-MEDICEAN PARTY OR PALLESCHI
THIS IS BY FAR THE FINEST THING THAT HAS EVER BEEN SEEN
LXXXVII DURING THIS WHILE I HAD SENT MY DEVOTED COMRADE FELICE BACK TO ROME TO LOOK AFTER OUR BUSINESS THERE
AFTERWARDS I SET TO WORK AT ALL THE THINGS I NEEDED AND LABOURED THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT
THIS PASSIONATE LOVE LED ME OFTENTIMES TO DELIGHT THE LAD WITH MUSIC
BUT THAT IF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY MADE SIGN OF WANTING ME ONE WORD OF HIS COMMUNICATED BY SO GREAT A PRINCE AS HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP WOULD SUFFICE TO MAKE ME SET OFF UPON THE SPOT LEAVING ALL OTHER CONCERNS TO TAKE THEIR CHANCE
YOU ARE ROBBING ME OF ALL THE GOOD I HAVE IN THIS WORLD. MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI WHO WAS PRESENT THEN BEGAN TO SAY
I APPEARED BEFORE THEM
THE ITALIAN IS PECULIAR
THEY DREW TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO FALL BACK MUTTERING ALL THE WHILE BENEATH THEIR BREATH IN THEIR OWN TONGUE
UPON THIS GENTLEMANS DEPARTURE MESSER GIOVANNI LOOKED ME IN THE FACE AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO CRY AND SAID
WE SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO FINISH THEM WITHOUT HIM AND HIS ENEMIES WOULD SAY THAT HE HAD TAKEN FLIGHT BECAUSE HE SHRANK BEFORE SUCH UNDERTAKINGS. MANY OTHER THINGS BEARING WEIGHTILY UPON THE SUBJECT WERE SAID AMONG THEM
WHO SAVES US IN THE STRIFE
XCV NEXT DAY I PRESENTED MYSELF AND AFTER A FEW WORDS OF CONVERSATION THE DUKE ADDRESSED ME CHEERFULLY
AND BEING ON TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE BISHOP HE INTRODUCED ME TO HIS FAVOUR SO THAT I OBTAINED MANY COMMISSIONS FROM THAT PRELATE AND EARNED CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY
THE WHOLE VALUE OF THESE EFFECTS EXCEEDED 1500 CROWNS
I HAD SENT GEMS AND FRENCH JEWELLERY MORE THAN A YEAR EARLIER TO THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DUCATS AND NOW BROUGHT WITH ME THE SAME WARES TO THE VALUE OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND CROWNS
HE ANSWERED THAT HE WISHED ME TO MAKE IT SQUARE BECAUSE HE LIKED THAT FORM BETTER
HE ORDERED PIERO STROZZI TO GO WITH SHIPS OF WAR INTO THE ENGLISH WATERS
EVENTUALLY I JOINED COMPANY WITH A VERY FAMOUS CLOCKMAKER CALLED MAESTRO CHERUBINO MY ESTEEMED FRIEND
THE POOR YOUNG MAN SHED TEARS AND CRIED
BUT THE ROGUE LIFTED HIS BIG UGLY VOICE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE THE BRAYING OF AN ASS THROUGH HIS HUGE NOSE AND SPOKE TO THIS EFFECT
IN COURSE OF TIME FIRENZUOLA AND I BECAME FRIENDS AND AT HIS REQUEST I STOOD GODFATHER TO ONE OF HIS CHILDREN
THEY REPRESENTED FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY
HOWEVER I KNELT UPON THE GROUND AND NOT WITHOUT TEARS RETURNED THANKS TO GOD AS I WAS WONT EXCLAIMING LORD THOU GAVEST ME THE CHILD AND THOU HAST TAKEN HIM
I FOR MY PART WHILE THESE VAIN FAVOURS WERE BEING SHOWERED UPON ME KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT MY PERVERSE AND BITING FORTUNE COULD NOT LONG DELAY TO SEND ME SOME FRESH CALAMITY BECAUSE I KEPT EVER BEFORE MY EYES THE GREAT MISTAKE I HAD COMMITTED WHILE SEEKING TO DO A GOOD ACTION
NEVERTHELESS AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE I COMFORTED MY SOUL BY CALLING TO MIND HOW MUCH MORE PAINFUL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON PASSING FROM THIS LIFE TO HAVE SUFFERED THAT UNIMAGINABLE HORROR OF THE HANGMANS KNIFE
X ALL THIS WHILE I WORKED AS A GOLDSMITH AND WAS ABLE TO ASSIST MY GOOD FATHER
AND IN THOSE DAYS I BEING STILL OF TENDER AGE MY FATHER HAD ME CARRIED AND MADE ME PERFORM UPON THE FLUTE
SO THE POPE THE CAVALIERE AND I BEING SHUT UP TOGETHER THEY LAID BEFORE ME THE TIARAS AND JEWELS OF THE REGALIA
MEANWHILE I WAS TO KEEP MY SPIRITS UP FOR HE WOULD WORK IN MY CAUSE TILL I WAS SET FREE
2 OTTAVIANO MIXED HIS STUPID DIES WITH MINE IN THE COINAGE OF CROWN-PIECES
AND AFTERWARDS HIS OFFENCE BEING OF TOO UGLY A NATURE HAD RESOLVED ON CUTTING OFF HIS HEAD
IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME UP TO THAT TIME AND ALL THE GREAT DANGERS TO MY OWN LIFE WHICH I RAN I SHOULD ASTOUND MY READERS
THEN I WENT TO DO WHAT HAD BEEN AGREED ON WITH THE POPE
THE REST WERE SCATTERED ON THE MULE WHICH FELL DEAD
SUCH IS THEIR RULE
MOST BLESSED FATHER MAY YOUR HOLINESS BE WILLING TO GRANT IT TO ONE WHO WORKS ASSIDUOUSLY IN THE EXERCISE OF SOME TALENT
HEREUPON AT THE REQUEST OF CERTAIN NOBLEMEN WHO WERE MY FRIENDS I UNDERTOOK TO FABRICATE SOME TRIFLING RINGS OF THIS KIND
HE KEPT TURNING FIRST THIS WAY AND THEN THAT
ALL HISTORIANS OF THE SACK OF ROME AGREE IN SAYING THAT BOURBON WAS SHOT DEAD WHILE PLACING LADDERS AGAINST THE OUTWORKS NEAR THE SHOP CELLINI MENTIONS
I TOOK THE DESIGN AND LEFT BAGNO AT ONCE TRAVELLING HOMEWARD AS FAST AS I COULD BY PRATO MAGNO AND SAN FRANCESCO DELLA VERNIA
I THEN THINKING IT WOULD SUIT MY PURPOSE TOOK IT AND HID IT IN MY STRAW MATTRESS
I MEANWHILE CONTINUED ALWAYS CALLING OUT BUT NOT TOO LOUDLY THAT THOSE WHO WANTED MY CAPE AND BLADE WOULD HAVE TO GET THEM WITH SOME TROUBLE
HIS FACE WAS FIERY AND MENACING INSTILLING FEAR INTO THE BEHOLDERS
YOU VILE RASCAL ARENT YOU ASHAMED TO TREAT A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO INTIMATE A COMRADE WITH YOU IN THIS WAY? AND WITH THE SAME MOVEMENT OF QUICK FEELING HE FACED ROUND AND SAID TO ME
HE TURNED ON ME AND CRIED
I BELIEVE THAT ON THE SAME DAY WHEN I OPENED IT A FEW HOURS TO THE PUBLIC MORE THAN TWENTY WERE NAILED UP ALL OF THEM OVERFLOWING WITH THE HIGHEST PANEGYRICS
5 THEN HE WENT AWAY WITH THE MOST PLEASANT WORDS AT PARTING WHILE I REMAINED AND CHOSE THE FINEST AND BEST ARQUEBUSE I EVER SAW OR EVER HAD AND TOOK IT BACK WITH ME TO HOME
I THEN WHO WANTED TO DISPLAY THE SHARPNESS OF MY OWN WITS TO SO INGENIOUS A MAN REPLIED THAT I WAS QUITE SURE OF BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE MOST BAFFLING LOCKS AND BARS FAR MORE THOSE OF OUR PRISON TO DO WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME TO ME AS EATING A BIT OF NEW CHEESE
MY DEAR BENVENUTO I HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR MANY YEARS AS THE GREATEST GOLDSMITH OF WHOM WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME? I REMAINED IN GREAT CONFUSION AND COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHAT HE MEANT
2 THESE THINGS I HAD NEARLY FINISHED
SO THEN THINKING I COULD DO THE BUSINESS BY DAYLIGHT FOR IT WAS STILL EARLY AND NOT CARING TO INTERRUPT MY WORKMEN AND BEING INDISPOSED TO TAKE A SERVANT WITH ME I SET OFF ALONE
DIED 1574
ON OUR ARRIVAL I FOUND THE LAD TOGETHER WITH HIS FATHER BROTHERS SISTERS AND STEPMOTHER
I KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT SORT OF POISON IT WAS AND WHO GAVE IT TO ME; UPON WHICH WE ALL WERE SILENT
3 ON THIS MORE SERIOUS OCCASION THEREFORE HE PRAYED ME TO ENLIST FIFTY COMRADES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE SAID HOUSE APPOINTING ME THEIR CAPTAIN AS I HAD BEEN WHEN THE COLONNESI CAME
AND SINCE SHE NEVER CARED TO MARRY SHE WAS ADMITTED AS A NUN IN SANTA ORSOLA
BENVENUTO ASK THEM SOMETHING. I CALLED ON THEM TO REUNITE ME WITH MY SICILIAN ANGELICA
AND SO ALTHOUGH I GOT THE GOOSE THE BOOT OF MY RIGHT LEG WAS FULL OF WATER
HE BEGGED ME IN REPLY TO LET HIM GO WITH ME AND SAID HE WOULD COME AT HIS OWN CHARGES
THIS DUCHESS WAS ELEONORA DI TOLEDO WELL KNOWN TO US THROUGH BRONZINOS PORTRAIT
A MISS IS AS GOOD AS A MILE. XVIII ON THE MORNING WHICH FOLLOWED THESE EVENTS I MADE THE FIRST STEP IN MY WORK UPON THE GREAT SALT-CELLAR PRESSING THIS AND MY OTHER PIECES FORWARD WITH INCESSANT INDUSTRY
THEN HE ASKED MY ADVICE CONCERNING THE APOLOGY WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY MADE TO THE EMPEROR FOR THE UNFINISHED CONDITION OF MY WORK
IS THAT DIEGO? I SAID
IF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCIES THINK FIT TO OPEN THE MODEL FOR A NEPTUNE TO COMPETITION ALTHOUGH YOU ARE RESOLVED TO GIVE IT TO BANDINELLO THIS WILL URGE BANDINELLO FOR HIS OWN CREDIT TO DISPLAY GREATER ART AND SCIENCE THAN IF HE KNEW HE HAD NO RIVALS
YOUR WORK SEEMS TO ME NO LESS BEAUTIFUL BUT WE SHALL SOON PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. SO HE TOOK HIS VASE AND CARRIED IT TO THE POPE WHO WAS VERY WELL PLEASED WITH IT AND ORDERED AT ONCE THAT HE SHOULD BE PAID AT THE ORDINARY RATE OF SUCH LARGE PLATE
BENVENUTO IF YOU WRITE TO HIM AND CAN PERSUADE HIM TO RETURN TO FLORENCE I WILL MAKE HIM A MEMBER OF THE FORTY-EIGHT. 2 ACCORDINGLY I WROTE A LETTER FULL OF WARMTH AND OFFERED IN THE DUKES NAME A HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN MY COMMISSION CARRIED
IT APPEARS FROM A LETTER WRITTEN BY GUIDI TO BANDINELLI THAT HE HATED CELLINI WHOM HE CALLED PESSIMO MOSTRO DI NATURA GUIDI WAS MADE BISHOP OF PENNA IN 1561 AND ATTENDED THE COUNCIL OF TRENT
1 AND AS I HAD NOT WRITTEN WHEN I REACHED MY SISTERS HOUSE SHE WEPT AND LAUGHED OVER ME ALL IN ONE BREATH
HE WAS THE MOST GENEROUS MAN IN THE WORLD
SEMPER QUOQUO ME VERTO STAT VIRTUS
THE DUKE WAS STATIONED AT A WINDOW LOW UPON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE PALACE JUST ABOVE THE ENTRANCE
THEN TAKING UP AN ATTITUDE OF DEFENCE WITH THE DAGGER IN MY RIGHT HAND AND THE SAFE-CONDUCT IN MY LEFT I CRIED TO THE LADS
NEVERTHELESS IF YOU ASK SOME POOR HUMBLE SHEPHERD WHICH HE LOVES BEST THOSE ROYAL CHILDREN OR HIS SONS HE WILL CERTAINLY TELL YOU THAT HE LOVES HIS OWN SONS BEST
AND THOUGH I WAS BUT YOUNG MY REPUTATION AS AN ABLE ARTIST WAS SO WELL KNOWN EVEN AT NAPLES THAT THEY WELCOMED ME MOST WARMLY
HIS NAME WAS FELICE GUADAGNI GAIN WHICH MADE HIM SAY IN JEST
I AM BURNING, AND SOMETIMES
BUT SINCE THE WHOLE HISTORY WOULD OCCUPY TOO MUCH SPACE I MUST OMIT IT
THEN WE WILL TAKE THEM WITHOUT ANY CLAMOUR TO OUR GREAT KING
AND INDEED THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA HAD NOW CONSPIRED WITH THE TWO ROGUES I LEFT IN CHARGE OF ALL MY BUSINESS
NEVERTHELESS I DID NOT GET ONE WINK OF SLEEP BECAUSE I KEPT ON THINKING HOW I COULD REVENGE MYSELF
PROBABLY GIANSTEFANO LALLI
AND THAT IF I WERE TO MOUNT IT AFRESH I COULD MAKE IT SHOW FAR BETTER THAN IT DID
NOW I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE DUCHESS BY HER SPECIAL INFLUENCE HAD MANAGED TO HAVE IT GIVEN TO BANDINELLO
THIS PAINTER WAS THE PUPIL OF BERTOLDO A MAN OF SIMPLE MANNERS AND OF SOME EXCELLENCE IN HIS ART
THEN HE TURNED UPON THE REST WITH SUCH ENERGY AND DARING THAT HIS ONE ARM WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE WHOLE BAND TO FLIGHT HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT WHILE WHEELING ROUND TO STRIKE AN ARQUEBUSIER THIS MAN FIRED IN SELF-DEFENCE AND HIT THE BRAVE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG FELLOW ABOVE THE KNEE OF HIS RIGHT LEG
THE MAN IS YOUNG I TROW TO BE SO ABLE IN HIS ART AND STILL APT ENOUGH TO LEARN MUCH. HE THEN ASKED ME WHAT MY NAME WAS
AND THIS TASK INVOLVED NO DIFFICULTY
HE WAS AN ENGINEER AND HAD MARVELLOUS SKILL IN MAKING INSTRUMENTS FOR LOWERING BRIDGES AND FOR WORKING MILLS AND OTHER MACHINES OF THAT SORT
THIS WOOD HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY OFFERED ME BY MADAME GINEVRA WIFE OF THE SAID CAPRETTA
SO I REASONED THUS IN MY OWN MIND
THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF ART WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED ARE VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER SO THAT A MAN WHO EXCELS IN ONE OF THEM IF HE UNDERTAKES THE OTHERS HARDLY EVER ACHIEVES THE SAME SUCCESS
THEN HE CRIED ONCE MORE TO ME FOR PITY
THEY BOTH HAD SWORDS
ACCORDINGLY MUCH TO MY DISCONTENT I REMAINED AT MUSIC TILL I REACHED THE AGE OF FIFTEEN
SHE SENT FOR A PAINTER WHO WAS ESTABLISHED AT FONTAINEBLEAU WHERE THE KING RESIDED NEARLY ALL HIS TIME
CLOSE AFTER THESE EVENTS THAT IS TO SAY IN THE DECEMBER OF 1566 FOLLOWING I MADE ANOTHER BLUNDER
I GAVE HIM SOMETHING AS WELL BECAUSE IT IS MY NATURE TO BE CHARITABLE AS ALSO BECAUSE I RECALLED WITH TEARS THE HAPPY STATE WHICH PIERINO HELD WHEN MY FATHER SPAKE THOSE WORDS OF PROPHECY NAMELY THAT PIERINOS CHILDREN SHOULD LIVE TO CRAVE SUCCOUR FROM HIS OWN VIRTUOUS SONS
THE FIRST OF THESE WAS INTENDED FOR THE DOOR OF THE PALACE AT FONTAINEBLEAU
1 HE ARRIVED FROM ENGLAND WHERE HE HAD RESIDED MANY YEARS
TOGETHER WITH GIULIO ROMANO HE COMPLETED THE IMPERFECT STANZE OF THE VATICAN
AND THEN WE TRAVELLED TOWARD FERRARA WHERE WE FOUND OUR LORD THE CARDINAL HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
I READ THE LETTER TO MY ANGELICA WHO BEGGED ME WITH TEARS OF AFFECTION EITHER TO REMAIN IN NAPLES OR TO TAKE HER WITH ME
AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER DUKE FEDERIGO HE GOVERNED MANTUA FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AS REGENT FOR HIS NEPHEWS AND BECAME FAMOUS AS A PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS
THEREFORE I CONSIDERED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I PUT MY LIFE TO RISK ALONE
NO SOONER HAD I SEEN THE WAX THAN I TOLD HIM THAT BOTH HE AND I WERE IN THE RIGHT
THE BLOW GIVEN TO PAGOLO HAD ONLY GRAZED THE SKIN 2 BUT THE OLD POSTMASTER WAS STRETCHED OUT DEAD
WHEN I HAD FINISHED THAT PART OF MY WORK I RAISED THE MOULD BY WINDLASSES AND STOUT ROPES TO A PERPENDICULAR POSITION AND SUSPENDING IT WITH THE GREATEST CARE ONE CUBIT ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE FURNACE SO THAT IT HUNG EXACTLY ABOVE THE MIDDLE OF THE PIT I NEXT LOWERED IT GENTLY DOWN INTO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE FURNACE AND HAD IT FIRMLY PLACED WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION FOR ITS SAFETY
NO TIME WAS LOST BEFORE I SET MYSELF TO WORK AT THINGS WHICH BROUGHT ME PROFIT BUT WERE NOT NOTABLE ENOUGH TO BE DESCRIBED
BUT NO SOONER HAD I PLACED THE LINEN THAN I BECAME AWARE BEHIND ME OF A SENTINEL WHO WAS GOING THE ROUNDS
THEN KNOWING I HAD BROUGHT THE DEAD TO LIFE AGAIN AGAINST THE FIRM OPINION OF THOSE IGNORAMUSES I FELT SUCH VIGOUR FILL MY VEINS THAT ALL THOSE PAINS OF FEVER ALL THOSE FEARS OF DEATH WERE QUITE FORGOTTEN
THE FILIPPO STROZZI MENTIONED AS HAVING BEEN HIS MASTER WAS THE GREAT OPPONENT OF THE MEDICEAN DESPOTISM WHO KILLED HIMSELF IN PRISON AFTER THE DEFEAT OF MONTEMURLO IN 1539
THAT MORNING A THICK WHITE FROST HAD FALLEN
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT I OUGHT TO CONTINUE IN HIS SERVICE AND THAT ALL THAT I HAD DONE WAS RIGHT AND PLEASING TO HIM
YOU HAVE SPOKEN I WILL DO. UPON THIS MESSER LUIGI ALAMANNI SMILED AND ADDED A GREAT MANY WITTY THINGS WITH THE GREATEST CHARM OF MANNER IN MY PRAISE
AND CALLING MESSER ANNIBAL CARO WHO LIVED WITH HIM BADE HIM GO FOR INFORMATION
4 THIS I DID ON FEAST-DAYS BECAUSE THE HOUSE WAS THEN INHABITED BY MESSER GISMONDO AGOSTINOS BROTHER
AND THERE THEY BOUGHT FOR HIM A LITTLE HOUSE IN VIA CHIARA CLOSE TO THE CONVENT OF S
THESE ARGUMENTS MADE HIS EXCELLENCY CONSENT THAT I SHOULD ONLY GO TO THE PALACE AFTER TWENTY-FOUR OCLOCK
LORD JUDGE LIEUTENANT OF THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING I CALL ON YOU FOR JUSTICE
IN THE PALACE I MET MESSER PIER FRANCESCO RICCI THE MAJORDOMO AND WHEN I DREW NIGH TO PAY HIM THE USUAL COMPLIMENTS HE EXCLAIMED WITH MEASURELESS ASTONISHMENT
AND IN THE CASE OF MY NOT RETURNING
AND I PAID HIM 650 CROWNS WHICH INCLUDED DUTIES TO THE STATE
NEVERTHELESS I WENT ON PRAYING TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY THAT HE WOULD FAVOUR MY PETITION
I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHO THE MAN WAS
HOWEVER I SAID TO MYSELF
STILL THE STROKE FELL WITH CRUSHING FORCE
I SAT DOWN TO WRITE AN ANSWER AND FILLED NINE PAGES OF ORDINARY PAPER
ILL SPEAK SOFT LEST I BE UNDERSTOOD
1 MADAME DETAMPES ADVISED HIM TO BEG THAT COMMISSION FOR THE FOUNTAIN WHICH HIS MAJESTY HAD GIVEN ME ADDING THAT SHE WOULD SUPPORT HIM WITH ALL HER ABILITY
WHEN I HAD DRAWN THE FIRST NAIL I BETHOUGHT ME HOW TO PREVENT ITS BEING NOTICED
HE I ADMIT COULD HAVE ACHIEVED THE SAME SUCCESS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BUT NOT WITH LESS FATIGUE AND TROUBLE THAN I ENDURED
ASCERTAINING THAT THE DUKE AND DUCHESS WERE OUT RIDING AND HAVING ALREADY PREPARED THE PEDESTAL I HAD THE STATUES CARRIED DOWN AND SOLDERED THEM WITH LEAD INTO THEIR PROPER NICHES
SCUDI DI MONETA NOT DORO NOTE 2
THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED IN THESE WORDS
IT IS QUITE ENOUGH IF YOU PERFORM YOUR DUTY AND SEE THAT HE DOES NOT ESCAPE ME. THEN HE CAME UP AND BEGGED ME WITH WORDS OF COURTESY TO SURRENDER MY ARMS
MY HEALTH IMPROVED ENORMOUSLY
I ALSO COULD SEE THAT MY WORK PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD MY METHOD WHICH DIFFERED VERY CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT OF ALL THE OTHER MASTERS IN THE TRADE
XCVIII THE DUKE SENT ME WORD BY MESSER LELIO TORELLO 1 HIS MASTER OF THE ROLLS 2 THAT HE WANTED ME TO EXECUTE SOME BAS-RELIEFS IN BRONZE FOR THE CHOIR OF S
ON THEN
I PUT MYSELF ONCE MORE UNDER DOCTORS ORDERS AND ATTENDED TO THEIR DIRECTIONS BUT GREW ALWAYS WORSE
SO LONG AS HE GIVES UP THE WORK THAT IS ENOUGH FOR US. I SPOKE
UPON MY WORD I THINK THE BLOWS AND KICKS YOU DEALT US LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU WERE SO ENRAGED AND HAD THAT DEMON IN YOUR BODY AS IT SEEMED MUST HAVE FRIGHTENED AWAY YOUR MORTAL FEVER
YET IN THE END I GOT IT OPEN AND SHOULDERING THE STRIPS OF LINEN WHICH I HAD ROLLED UP LIKE BUNDLES OF FLAX UPON TWO STICKS I WENT FORTH AND DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE LATRINES OF THE KEEP
GAIO BROKE OUT AT ONCE
XCVII I HAD ALMOST DETERMINED TO SAY NOTHING MORE ABOUT THAT UNLUCKY PERSEUS
THE MEDAL WAS STRUCK TO CELEBRATE THE PEACE IN CHRISTENDOM BETWEEN 1530 AND 1536
THE POPE IN TRUTH HAD PROMISED HIM A BISHOPRIC
WHAT I HAD SAID ABOUT THE KEYS WAS THE MEREST TRIFLE
IS THIS THEN THE PRESUMPTUOUS PRIESTLY RECOMPENSE YOU GIVE A MAN WHO HAS SERVED AND LOVED YOU WITH SUCH LOYALTY WITH SUCH MASTERY OF ART
AND HAVING GONE TO WAIT ON HIM ONE MORNING IN THE VIA DE SERVI I SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
BOURBONS ARMY HAD NOW ARRIVED BEFORE THE WALLS OF ROME AND ALESSANDRO BEGGED ME TO GO WITH HIM TO RECONNOITRE
BUT WHEN I OBSERVED THAT THINGS WENT QUITE THE CONTRARY WAY AND SAW THAT I WAS BEING PILLAGED I LOST TEMPER WITH THE MAN AND RECALLED TO HIS MEMORY HOTLY AND IN ANGER WHAT HE HAD DECLARED HE WOULD BE IF HE DID NOT PAY ME
I INVITED VINCENZIO ROMOLI A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE AND THE PRIEST TOOK WITH HIM A NATIVE OF PISTOJA WHO ALSO CULTIVATED THE BLACK ART
AND FIRST I PRAYED MOST DEVOUTLY TO GOD IMPLORING HIS DIVINE MAJESTY TO PROTECT AND SUCCOUR ME IN THAT SO PERILOUS A VENTURE
DURING THEIR EXILE THE SCUTCHEONS WHICH WERE ON THE PALACE OF THE MEDICI HAD HAD THEIR BALLS ERASED AND A GREAT RED CROSS PAINTED OVER THEM WHICH WAS THE BEARING OF THE COMMUNE
JUST OPPOSITE THE BADIA I MET THE DUKE WHO WAS COMING BY THE PALACE OF THE PODESTA
HE IS A SHEEP-GRAZIER
I INSIST ON BEING PAID OVERNIGHT AND IN MY OWN WAY. I RETORTED THAT MEN WHO WANTED EVERYTHING THEIR OWN WAY OUGHT TO MAKE A WORLD AFTER THEIR OWN FASHION SINCE THINGS WERE DIFFERENTLY MANAGED HERE
FOR I OBSERVED THAT HIS MARVELLOUS FEATURES WHICH BY COMPLEXION WORE A TONE OF MODEST MELANCHOLY BRIGHTENED UP AND WHEN I TOOK MY CORNET BROKE INTO A SMILE SO LOVELY AND SO SWEET THAT I DO NOT MARVEL AT THE SILLY STORIES WHICH THE GREEKS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE DEITIES OF HEAVEN
IF BENVENUTO HAD SHOWN ME THOSE FINE THINGS OF HIS HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME SOME REASON TO BE MINDFUL OF HIM AT THE PROPER MOMENT. THE KING SOUGHT TO EXCUSE ME BUT HE MADE NO IMPRESSION ON HER TEMPER
FRANçOIS I SENT FOR HIM SOME TIME BEFORE 1542 APPOINTED HIM HIS OWN PHYSICIAN AND PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE IN THE ROYAL COLLEGE
WHILE THE PRELATE WAS ONE DAY OSTENTATIOUSLY EXHIBITING MY VASE TO CERTAIN SPANISH GENTLEMEN OF HIS SUITE IT CHANCED THAT ONE OF THEM UPON MONSIGNORS QUITTING THE ROOM BEGAN ROUGHLY TO WORK THE HANDLE AND AS THE GENTLE SPRING WHICH MOVED IT COULD NOT BEAR HIS LOUTISH VIOLENCE IT BROKE IN HIS HAND
I KEPT A SHAGGY DOG VERY BIG AND HANDSOME WHICH DUKE ALESSANDRO GAVE ME
CONSEQUENTLY I ASKED HIS EXCELLENCY TO MAKE ME APPOINTMENTS 2 AND TO GRANT ME THE LODGINGS OF THE MINT
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE FOUR MONTHS THAT I FELT THE POWER OR WILL TO EAT
I GAVE BENVENUTO INTO YOUR CHARGE AND YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM. THE CARDINAL SAID THAT HE WOULD PUNCTUALLY PERFORM HIS MAJESTYS COMMANDS
THEREFORE I ASSURE YOUR LORDSHIP THAT ALL THE TROUBLES YOU ARE NOW CAUSING ME FALL A THOUSAND TIMES SHORT OF THE GREAT GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME
FOR FELLOWS WHO PRACTICE LEWD TRADES OF THAT SORT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF EARNING MONEY NOR ARE THEY MEN OF MUCH ABILITY
I SET OFF AND RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES
WITH GREAT ADDRESS I STOLE UP TO HIM HOLDING A LARGE PISTOJAN DAGGER 2 AND DEALT HIM A BACK-HANDED STROKE WITH WHICH I MEANT TO CUT HIS HEAD CLEAN OFF
NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD RECEIVE THE DIVINE SACRAMENT IN THIS ALREADY RUINED FRAME
BUT MY EAGERNESS TO WORK IN MARBLE WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO FINISH THE MODEL AS CORRECTLY AS THIS ART DEMANDS
ELSEWISE IT IS CERTAIN THAT MY WISH TO SHIELD A SILLY MANNIKIN FROM REPROACH IF ONLY FOR OUR COUNTRYS SAKE WOULD HAVE MADE ME FIND OUT SOME EXCUSE TO MEND THE BUNGLING OF HIS FOOLISH SELF-CONCEIT
CHARLES V ERECTED HIS FIEF INTO A DUCHY IN 1530
AFTER SETTING MY HANDS TO IT AND FEELING IT MOVE IT EASILY GAVE WAY AND I DREW IT OUT
THE PAINTER WAS AN ITALIAN AND A BOLOGNESE KNOWN THEN AS IL BOLOGNA
HE LEFT A WIFE OF BAD CHARACTER AND ONE SON WHO AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME YEARS CAME TO ME TO BEG FOR ALMS IN ROME
AFTER SOME DAYS I SENT FOR MAESTRO RAFFAELLO Dé PILLI THE SURGEON WHO OBTAINED A COUPLE OF LIVE PIGEONS AND PLACING ME UPON MY BACK ACROSS A TABLE TOOK THE BIRDS AND OPENED A LARGE VEIN THEY HAVE BENEATH THE WING SO THAT THE BLOOD GUSHED OUT INTO MY EYE
MOST BLESSED FATHER PARDON IF I PUT A QUESTION
THIS MADE HIM ARREST THE FRIAR WHO BETRAYED THE REGISTRAR AND THE ALTER RAN A RISK OF BEING HANGED
SO I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH ANOTHER PIECE OF STONE AND RESERVED THE GREEK MARBLE FOR A NARCISSUS WHICH I MODELLED ON A SMALL SCALE IN WAX
AND I COULD SHOW RECEIPTS FROM ALL THE MEN INTO WHOSE HANDS THEY PASSED WHETHER FOR GOODS SUPPLIED OR LABOUR RENDERED
BENVENUTO I AM CERTAINLY SORRY TO COME BACK FROM THE POPE WITH SUCH COMMANDS AS I HAVE RECEIVED
TELL HIM FROM ME THAT IF HE DOES NOT BRING ASCANIO HERE HIMSELF TO MY SHOP BEFORE THE BELL FOR VESPERS I WILL ASSUREDLY KILL HIM
SHE IMMEDIATELY INQUIRED WHAT I MEANT TO DO WITH IT
THEN WHEN I GAINED SOME RESPITE FROM THAT DIN OF TROUBLES AND HAD GIVEN MY SOUL TO GOD CONTENTED BETTER REALMS AND STATE TO WIN I SAW ALONG THE PATH WHICH SAINTS HAVE TROD FROM HEAVEN DESCENDING GLAD WITH GLORIOUS PALM AN ANGEL
GO AND FIND OUT A YOUNG GOLDSMITH NAMED BENVENUTO
I MEAN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE PROVED THEIR MANHOOD AND ACHIEVED RENOWN
AND UNDER THE PRETENCE OF THESE TALENTS HE BROUGHT HIM AS FAMILIAR TO HIMSELF AS HIS OWN FLESH BLOOD
FOR THE DATE WAS DRAWING NEAR AND I THOUGHT IT SINGULAR THAT I HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HER
THEREAFTER WHEN I SEARCHED MY MEMORY TO FIND WHAT COULD HAVE DIVERTED ME FROM THAT DESIGN OF SUICIDE I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME POWER DIVINE AND MY GOOD GUARDIAN ANGEL
THIS MAN HAVING BECOME MY ENEMY ASSIDUOUSLY STROVE TO DO ME HURT
3 HER HABIT OF BODY WAS UNHEALTHY AND SO I NEVER CAME WITHOUT INCOMMODING HER
HE WORKED ON THE BAS-RELIEFS OF SAN PETRONIO AT BOLOGNA AND HELPED MICHEL AGNOLO DA SIENA TO EXECUTE THE TOMB OF ADRIAN VI
AT THAT TIME I TOOK MY LEAVE AND WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE INN FOUND A MOST EXCELLENT MEAL READY
THE KING DECLARED THIS HERCULES TO BE THE UGLIEST WORK OF ART THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN AND SPOKE HIS OPINION PLAINLY TO THE CRAFTSMEN OF PARIS
SHE NOW CONFIDED IN HIM AS SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE IN ME
WE HAVE DIS-DUKED THEM AND WONT HAVE ANY MORE OF THEM
BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT I WAS BEING COMPLIMENTED I CAME UP TURNED TO THE DUKE AND SAID
WHILE UTTERING THESE WORDS I LOOKED AT AGNOLINO GADDI WHOSE EYES WERE STARTING FROM THEIR SOCKETS IN HIS TERROR AND WHO WAS MORE THAN HALF DEAD AND SAID TO HIM
BUT THAT SINCE I HAD SET IT AND HE KNEW ME FOR THE FIRST ARTIST IN THE WORLD IT WOULD NOT MAKE THE SAME EFFECT WHEN MOUNTED BY ANOTHER HAND
THEREFORE I SHALL HAVE THE STATUE VALUED AND SHALL GIVE YOU WHAT THE EXPERTS THINK IT WORTH. TO THESE WORDS I REPLIED WITH TOO MUCH DARING AND A TOUCH OF INDIGNATION WHICH IS ALWAYS OUT OF PLACE IN DEALING WITH GREAT PRINCES
ONE OF THESE OCCURRED IN THIS WAY
AND ONE MORNING AT HIS DINNER THE KING CALLED ME
SOMETIMES THE GUARDIAN IN HIS EFFORT TO PREVENT THE ENTRANCE OF SOME IMPROPER PERSON INTERRUPTED THE JUDGE BY THE GREAT NOISE HE MADE AND THE JUDGE IN ANGER TURNED TO CHIDE HIM
WHILE ASCANIO WITH HIS FATHER BESOUGHT ME TO PARDON AND TAKE HIM BACK
YOUR DUNGEONS DRIPPING
FOR INASMUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY ME I COULD AT THE BEGINNING GET MORE HELP FROM THEM THAN FROM THE PARIS WORKMEN
AND WITH THIS HE PROCEEDED TO GET FALSE KEYS MADE UPON THE METHOD I HAD HEEDLESSLY REVEALED TO HIM
IT IS IN MY POWER TO ABSOLVE YOU OF ANY UNBECOMING DEED YOU MAY HAVE DONE AND WHAT IS MORE I HAVE THE WILL
AFTERWARDS HE HAD SETTLED IN ROME WHERE HE TRANSACTED BUSINESS FOR SOME SIENESE MERCHANTS OF THE CHIGI
HE DID MORE THAN YEOMANS SERVICE NO DOUBT
HE WAS MURDERED AT PARMA BY HIS OWN COURTIERS IN 1547
PAUL III GAVE HIM THE HAT IN 1535 AND HE DIED IN 1537
MY DEAR LITTLE BOY I AM NOT STRIKING YOU FOR ANY WRONG THAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT ONLY TO MAKE YOU REMEMBER THAT THAT LIZARD WHICH YOU SEE IN THE FIRE IS A SALAMANDER A CREATURE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE BY ANY ONE OF WHOM WE HAVE CREDIBLE INFORMATION. SO SAYING HE KISSED ME AND GAVE ME SOME PIECES OF MONEY
CONTENDING WITH MY SUBLIME MASTER I COULD GAIN LAURELS IN PLENTY WHEREAS THERE ARE BUT FEW TO BE REAPED IN A CONTEST WITH THESE MEN. AFTER I HAD SPOKEN SHE ROSE IN A HALF-ANGRY MOOD AND I RETURNED TO WORK WITH ALL THE STRENGTH I HAD UPON MY MODEL
ALL MEN TRY TO PUSH THEIR AFFAIRS IN EVERY WAY THEY CAN
HAVING FOUND MY LINES AND ATTACHED THEM TO THE BATTLEMENT I LET MYSELF GO
I TURNED TO HER WITH A PLEASANT AIR AND SAID
IT WAS ALSO THE CAUSE OF MY MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH CERTAIN HUNTERS AFTER CURIOSITIES WHO FOLLOWED IN THE TRACK 1 OF THOSE LOMBARD PEASANTS WHO USED TO COME TO ROME TO TILL THE VINEYARDS AT THE PROPER SEASON
AS SOON AS HIS WOUND HAD BEEN DRESSED DUKE ALESSANDRO APPEARED AND MOST AFFECTIONATELY GREETED HIM
HE HAD A VIOL IN HIS HAND AND WAS PLAYING AND SINGING ALONE BESIDE THE FIRE
VARCHI ST FIOR LIB
THERE I PARTED FOR EVER FROM THAT BEAST OF A FRENCHMAN REMAINING ON VERY FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE OTHER WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN
IT WAS CHASED IN BAS-RELIEF WITH FIGURES AND OTHER PRETTY ORNAMENTS AND HIS EXCELLENCY MEANT IT FOR THE DUCHESS TO DRINK WATER OUT OF
THAT VILLAIN CHURL WHOSE OFFICE TWAS TO BRING MY FOOD I BADE TASTE FIRST
MY LORDS MY EXAMINATION IS NOT OVER
MOST BLESSED FATHER I CANNOT PRETEND FOR CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL GET HIM FOR HIS PROFESSION TO WHICH HE DEVOTES HIMSELF ASSIDUOUSLY IS THAT OF A GOLDSMITH AND HE WORKS IN IT MIRACULOUSLY WELL AND EARNS BY IT FAR MORE THAN HE COULD DO BY PLAYING. TO THIS THE POPE ADDED
SINCE I PRODUCED FEW THINGS OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AT THAT PERIOD I NEED NOT WASTE TIME IN TALKING ABOUT THEM
QUITE THE CONTRARY
THIS EXCELLENT PERSON MADE ME OBSERVE THAT THE BAGNI CONTAINED MINES OF GOLD AND SILVER AND SHOWED ME MANY INTERESTING OBJECTS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IT WAS JUST LIKE PASSING THROUGH THE ZODIAC NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
THEN I TURNED AND TOLD THE SHOPBOY HE HAD BEATEN TO HAND HIM THE BUNDLE OF CLOTHES AND SAID TO HIM
I REPLIED THAT I WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THEM BUT THAT I SHOULD REQUIRE TO BE PAID IN ADVANCE
THEN THEY BEGAN TO PUT A GENTLE PRESSURE ON HIM SAYING
WHILE THE SECRETARY WAS ON HIS WAY WITH MY SONNET TO THE POPE THE CASTELLAN SENT ME LIGHTS FOR DAY AND NIGHT TOGETHER WITH ALL THE CONVENIENCES ONE COULD WISH FOR IN THAT PLACE
PEACE BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND WAS NOT CONCLUDED TILL JUNE 7 1546
THE FRENCH DISEASE FOR IT WAS THAT REMAINED IN ME MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS DORMANT BEFORE IT SHOWED ITSELF AND THEN IT BROKE OUT OVER MY WHOLE BODY AT ONE INSTANT
AFTER THE SALADS HAD BEEN MIXED AND WE WERE PREPARING TO SIT DOWN TO TABLE THAT EVIL PRIEST WITH A CERTAIN NASTY SORT OF GRIN EXCLAIMED
XXXI IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL ALL THE MANY AND DIVERS PIECES OF WORK WHICH I EXECUTED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MEN
HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD NO ACQUAINTANCE WITH PHYSICIANS OR WITH SURGEONS AND ENTREATED ME IF I KNEW OF ONE TO BRING HIM TO THE HOUSE
FOR THIS MERCY I RETURN THANKS TO GOD WITH GREATER HEARTINESS THAN EVER
AND IF I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES SOME CRIME HE HAD COMMITTED I SHOULD NOT BELIEVE IT. THIS WAS THE MAN WHO 3 CAUSED ME THE GREATEST TORMENT AND WHO SUDDENLY CAME UP BEFORE MY MIND
THE POPE READ THE SONNET SEVERAL TIMES
THEY EXCHANGED CONGRATULATIONS AND THANKED GOD FOR OUR SUCCESS SAYING THEY HAD LEARNED AND SEEN THINGS DONE WHICH OTHER MASTERS JUDGED IMPOSSIBLE
IN COURSE OF TIME HOWEVER I COMPLETED THE REVERSE
ON CATCHING SIGHT OF ME HE THREATENED WITH HIS HEAD AND SPOKE IN A SUBDUED VOICE
THIS LETTER WHEN I READ IT PUT ME IN SUCH A FRIGHT THAT I WENT TO SEEK MY DEAR FRIEND PIERO LANDI
WHEN I HAD FINISHED SOME SCRAPS OF SALAD REMAINED UPON MY PLATE AND CERTAIN VERY FINE AND GLITTERING SPLINTERS CAUGHT MY EYE AMONG THESE REMNANTS
I PAID 25,000 DUCATS FOR IT
YET THE ART DISPLAYED BY THIS GREAT MASTER OF ANTIQUITY CRIES OUT TO ME TO HELP HIM. THE DUKE WAS HIGHLY DELIGHTED TO FIND THE STATUE SO BEAUTIFUL AND PUT ME A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SAYING
SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED I MIGHT HAVE DECAMPED FROM THE REALM
HIS REAL NAME WAS GIACOPO DELLA SCIORINA BUT THEY CALLED HIM DELLA BARCA IN ROME BECAUSE HE KEPT A FERRY BOAT UPON THE TIBER BETWEEN PONTE SISTO AND PONTE SANTO AGNOLO
LOVE AFFAIRS LIKE MINE WERE NOTHING BUT VANITIES AND FOLLIES WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE
MY NAILS HAD GROWN SO LONG THAT I COULD NOT TOUCH MY BODY WITHOUT WOUNDING IT
YOUVE BEEN BOUGHT AND SOLD
THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
NOT MANY DAYS AFTER A FRIEND OF MINE INFORMED ME THAT SIGNOR PIER LUIGI HAD GIVEN STRICT ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE TAKEN THAT VERY EVENING
CELLINI MAKES A MISTAKE HERE
UPON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN I PAID MY RESPECTS TO THE DUKE HE BECKONED TO ME
BENVENUTO WE PREVENTED YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL BUT DID IT FOR YOUR GOOD
BY NOTWITHSTANDING I WAS OF THAT TENDER AGE WHEN LITTLE CHILDREN ARE WONT TO TAKE PASTIME IN WHISTLES AND SUCH TOYS I HAD AN INEXPRESSIBLE DISLIKE FOR IT AND PLAYED AND SANG ONLY TO OBEY HIM
I FREELY ADMIT THAT IF SCULPTURE WERE HIS BUSINESS INSTEAD OF PAINTING THEN BRONZINO MIGHT HAVE BEEN EQUAL A TO TASK LIKE MINE
AND WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DUCHESS HER GRACE SAID THAT SHE ESTEEMED MY SETTING QUITE AS HIGHLY AS THE DIAMOND WHICH BERNARDACCIO HAD MADE THEM BUY
THE WHOLE COLISEUM IS IN FLAMES AND THE FIRE IS ADVANCING ON US; THEN COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GROANED AGAIN THAT HE WAS DEAD AND THAT HE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT LONGER
THE NOBLEMAN SAID ON LOOKING AT IT THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN A MORE STUPENDOUS PIECE OF WORK
BENVENUTO WOULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER TO DIE BECAUSE HE IS COME TO PUT HIS HEAD INTO A NOOSE AND I WILL NEVER PARDON HIM. ACCORDINGLY WHEN NICCOLò ARRIVED HE SAID TO ME IN DESPERATION
LE PIù ISVENEVOLE CAREZZE DASINO LXIII TOBBIA THE GOLDSMITH MEANWHILE WORKED AT THE SETTING AND THE DECORATION OF THE UNICORNS HORN
I WAS PERHAPS MORE INCLINED BY NATURE TO THE PROFESSION OF ARMS THAN TO THE ONE I HAD ADOPTED AND I TOOK SUCH PLEASURE IN ITS DUTIES THAT I DISCHARGED THEM BETTER THAN THOSE OF MY OWN ART
ARAI DI GRAZIA DI I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE GIVEN THE RIGHT SHADE OF MEANING IN THE TEXT ABOVE
AFTER THIS YOU MAY BLUSH AT YOUR LEISURE FOR HAVING DONE SUCH CRUEL INJUSTICE TO A MAN LIKE ME WHO HAS PERFORMED SO MANY HONOURABLE SERVICES FOR THE APOSTOLIC CHAIR
HOLD HIM TIGHT NOW THAT HE MAY NOT ESCAPE YOU. SEIZED BY THEM WITH FORCE AND ROUGHLY HANDLED AND ANTICIPATING SOMETHING FAR WORSE THAN WHAT AFTERWARDS HAPPENED I LIFTED MY EYES TO CHRIST AND SAID
THEREFORE WHEN NO FURTHER INSULTS WERE CAST AT ME I SHOOK MY HEAD AND EXCLAIMED
DEAR ALBERTACCIO DEAREST TO ME ABOVE ALL MEN THAT LIVE THE TIME WILL VERY LIKELY COME WHEN YOU SHALL GIVE ME AID
THE PRUDENT YOUNG MAN GUESSING PERHAPS PRETTY NEARLY HOW THE MATTER STOOD REPLIED
THE COMMODUS IS A STATUE OF HERCULES WITH THE LIONS SKIN AND AN INFANT IN HIS ARMS ALSO IN THE VATICAN
LXXIII HAVING SUCCEEDED SO WELL WITH THE CAST OF THE MEDUSA I HAD GREAT HOPE OF BRINGING MY PERSEUS THROUGH
MY LIKING FOR THE ART WAS SO GREAT OR I MAY TRULY SAY MY NATURAL BIAS BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER THAT IN A FEW MONTHS I CAUGHT UP THE GOOD NAY THE BEST YOUNG CRAFTSMEN IN OUR BUSINESS AND BEGAN TO REAP THE FRUITS OF MY LABOURS
WHEREFORE OUR SCHOOL STILL EXCLAIMS AGAINST THE GREAT WRONG WHICH WAS DONE TO THAT MAGNIFICENT BLOCK
IN SPITE OF GIORGETTOS TRYING TO DOSE HIM WITH HIS FLUENT NONSENSE THE DUKE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO MESSER GIANSTEFANO 4 EXCLAIMED
BE ASSURED THAT WHAT YOU SAY WILL BE BURIED IN A DIAMOND CASKET! TO THIS ENGAGEMENT UPON HONOUR I REPLIED BY TELLING THE TRUTH ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT NAMELY THAT THE PEARLS WERE NOT WORTH ABOVE TWO THOUSAND CROWNS
THIS ROUSED ME TO EXCLAIM
LEAVE YOUR BRONZE AWHILE AND LET ME WATCH YOU WORKING ON THE MARBLE. THEN I TOOK CHISEL AND MALLET AND WENT AT IT BLITHELY
BUT THE HONOUR WHICH IT BROUGHT ME WAS WORTH FAR MORE THAN THE GAIN I MIGHT HAVE JUSTLY MADE BY IT
THAT WAS FROM THE HOUR OF TWENTY AND A HALF TO TWENTY-ONE AND A HALF
THE POPE HAS COMMISSIONED ME TO SUPERINTEND EVERYTHING WHICH IS BEING MADE FOR HIS HOLINESS. I ONLY REPLIED THAT I WOULD ASK THE POPE AND THEN SHOULD KNOW WHAT ANSWER I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM
WHEN NEXT YOU MEET BENVENUTO LET HIM KNOW FROM ME THAT IT WAS HE WHO GOT THAT OFFICE IN THE PIOMBO FOR BASTIANO THE PAINTER AND ADD THAT HE MAY RECKON ON OBTAINING THE NEXT CONSIDERABLE PLACE THAT FALLS
THESE TWO BROTHERS WERE SPECIALLY EMINENT AS DIE-CASTERS
HE WAS ENGAGED IN BURSTING OPEN CERTAIN BOXES TO GET AT THE JEWELS HE HAD NOTICED WHEN MY DOG JUMPED UPON HIM AND PUT HIM TO MUCH TROUBLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF WITH HIS SWORD
THE DUKE CAME FREQUENTLY INTO THE WARDROBE AND TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN WATCHING ME AT WORK AND TALKING TO ME
YET I FORCED MYSELF TO STRAIN EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE
WHETHER TO DECAMP AND LEAVE FRANCE TO THE DEVIL OR ELSE TO FIGHT THIS BATTLE THROUGH AS I HAD DONE THE REST AND SEE TO WHAT END GOD HAD MADE ME
FRANCESCO WAS AN EXCELLENT PAINTER OF MINIATURE OIL-PICTURES
I THOUGHT THE OLD MAN HELD ROPES IN HIS HAND AND WHILE HE WAS PREPARING TO BIND ME FELICE HAD ARRIVED AND STRUCK HIM WITH AN AXE SO THAT THE OLD MAN FLED EXCLAIMING
THIS RIENZO RENZO OR LORENZO DA CERI WAS A CAPTAIN OF ADVENTURERS OR CONDOTTIERE WHO HIRED HIS MERCENARY FORCES TO PAYMASTERS
THE DOOR BEGAN TO REVEAL ITS BEAUTIES
IN A FEW WORDS I COULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT THE MATTER WAS AS I HAD TOLD IT
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT I SET THAT HUGE COLOSSUS UP TO SATISFY MY OWN DESIRE PAYING FOR IT FROM MY OWN PURSE EVEN TO THE POINT WHICH IT HAS REACHED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU BEING THE GREAT KING YOU ARE AND I THE TRIFLING ARTIST THAT I AM IT WAS MY DUTY TO ERECT FOR YOUR GLORY AND MY OWN A STATUE THE LIKE OF WHICH THE ANCIENTS NEVER SAW
THE MEDAL COMMEMORATED A DEEP WELL SUNK BY CLEMENT AT ORVIETO
WHILE I KEPT A PARTNER IN MY WORKSHOP WHO HAD BEEN MY PRENTICE AND WAS CALLED FELICE
AS YOU HAVE BOASTED THAT I AM A FELLOW OF SUCH PARTS DO YOU NOT THINK THAT I SHALL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY WIFE AND SATISFY HER NEEDS EVEN IF I RECEIVE SOMETHING SHORT OF THE PORTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET
CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE LEFT A MEMORANDUM WRITTEN IN HIS OWN HAND TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WOULD ALWAYS KEEP UP THESE PRODUCTS OF THE FARM IN THE SAME VALUES DURING MY LIFETIME I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO INSPECT IT
PANTASILEA TOOK TO HER HEELS IN THE DIRECTION OF A NEIGHBOURING CHURCH
IT IS OF SUCH DIFFICULT EXECUTION THAT I THINK NO MAN EVER ATTEMPTED THE LIKE BEFORE
I RELATED THE WHOLE AND ADDED THAT THE MAN MUST HAVE BEEN OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE THE INN TO WHICH THEY CARRIED HIM HAD BEEN IMMEDIATELY FILLED BY ALL THE CHIEFS OF THE ARMY SO FAR AT LEAST AS I COULD JUDGE
NOT MERELY BECAUSE THEY HAD HEARD THAT I WAS DEAD BUT FAR MORE BECAUSE I HAD THE LOOK OF A DEAD MAN
NOW I TELL YOU THAT I SHALL BE SATISFIED IF YOU WILL MAKE A MODEL WHILE I MAKE ANOTHER IN ADDITION TO THE ONE I HAVE ALREADY SHOWN
WHEN I TOLD HIS EXCELLENCY THAT ONE OUGHT TO TAKE MEASURES AT ONCE HE REFLECTED FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
MY LORD PRAY LET ME HAVE YOUR GOOD-WILL FOR I WILL MAKE YOU A MUCH FINER MEDAL THAN THE ONE I MADE FOR POPE CLEMENT
THE BATS THE THING-THE BATS THE THING! THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB HE WAS THE ELDEST AND YET THE YOUNGEST FROM THE STRENGTH AND VIGOUR OF HIS BODY
THE CASTELLAN HAD ORDERED THE PORTCULLIS TO BE LOWERED IN ORDER TO DO WHICH THEY CLEARED A LITTLE SPACE AND THIS ENABLED US FOUR TO GET INSIDE
1 THIS HE HAD NOTED DOWN AT SO MANY BUSHELS OF GRAIN SO MUCH OF WINE OIL STANDING CORN CHESTNUTS AND OTHER PRODUCE
IN IVORY HE WAS THE FIRST WHO WROUGHT REALLY WELL
LODOVICO DA FANO IS MENTIONED AS AN EXCELLENT LATIN SCHOLAR
BINDO HAD IN HIS HANDS 1200 GOLDEN CROWNS OF MINE WHICH FORMED PART OF 5000 HE HAD LENT THE DUKE
FELICE TOOK HIS WAY AND DID AS MAESTRO FRANCESCO HAD ORDERED
BUT THIS MUCH HE WANTS TO HAVE DONE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HIS OWN HONOUR IN THE AFFAIR. IN RETURN TO THIS SPEECH I ANSWERED LAUGHING THAT I WOULD VERY WILLINGLY GIVE UP MY WORK IN THE WAY HE MENTIONED BECAUSE I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT A POPES WORD WAS REALLY WORTH
THIS MENTION OF AN ITALIAN BIBLE SHOWS THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE COUNCIL OF TRENT
NO BAD TREE EVER BORE GOOD FRUIT
ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS HE TOLD ME WITH A TOUCH OF PLEASANTRY THAT IT WAS REALLY SHAMEFUL FOR ME TO HAVE BOUGHT A FARM AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF SO MANY WEEKS NOT YET TO HAVE LEFT MY BUSINESS FOR THREE DAYS IN THE HANDS OF MY WORKPEOPLE SO AS TO HAVE COME TO LOOK AT IT
WHEN THEY HEARD WHAT A TUMULT I WAS MAKING MY ADVERSARIES LOWERED THEIR VOICES BUT I LIFTED MINE THE MORE
I LIFTED THE VEIL FROM THE HEAD OF MY BEAUTY
TO-MORROW I WILL GIVE MY ANSWER. WHEN I LEFT THEM I WENT MEDITATING WHETHER I OUGHT TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION INASMUCH AS I COULD NOT BUT SUFFER IF I ABANDONED THE NOBLE STUDIES OF MY ART
AFTER BRINGING HIM TO MY HOUSE I BEGGED HIM TO LET ME ARRAY HIM IN THE WOMANS CLOTHES WHICH I HAD CAUSED TO BE LAID OUT
I CHOSE A SWIVEL AND A FALCONET WHICH WERE BOTH A LITTLE DAMAGED IN THE MUZZLE AND FILLED THEM WITH THE PROJECTILES I HAVE MENTIONED
I HAD INDEED BEGUN TO MAKE HIS PORTRAIT AND WAS EXECUTING A MEDAL IN SECRET
NOW BOLOGNA HAD BROUGHT ALL HIS ANTIQUES INTO THIS GALLERY WROUGHT WITH GREAT BEAUTY IN BRONZE AND HAD PLACED THEM IN A HANDSOME ROW UPON THEIR PEDESTALS
I CALLED THIS FONTAINEBLEAU AFTER THE PLACE SELECTED BY THE KING FOR HIS PARTICULAR DELIGHT
THEN HE CALLED HIS TREASURER AND WHISPERED A FEW WORDS IN HIS EAR
I TOLD HIM THAT I WORKED A LITTLE IN THE SAME TRADE AS HIS OWN
AS HAPPENED TO THIS MARBLE WHEN IT CAME INTO THE HANDS OF BARTOLOMMEO AMMANATO 2 OF WHOM I SHALL SPEAK THE TRUTH IN ITS PROPER PLACE
I HAD ONLY WORN IT ONCE ON THE OCCASION WHEN I WALKED IN PROCESSION
BUT NOW THAT HE IS FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY BE FOUND UNEQUAL TO THE STRAIN
I KNEW NOTHING OF POMPEOS DEATH BUT PLENTY OF BENVENUTOS PROVOCATION
OH THE VILLAINS! I SAID IN CONCLUSION THAT I FELT OBLIGED TO THEM AND OPENED OTHER AND MORE CHEERFUL SUBJECTS OF CONVERSATION
THE FOLLIES OF THIS MAN HAVE BLINDED ME FOR A MOMENT TO THE GLORY OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY AND TO MYSELF
THE ITALIAN IS SOBBILLATO WHICH MIGHT BE ALSO TRANSLATED INVEIGLED OR INSTIGATED BUT VARCHI THE CONTEMPORARY OF CELLINI GIVES THIS VERB THE FORCE OF USING PRESSURE AND BORING ON UNTIL SOMEBODY IS DRIVEN TO DO SOMETHING
YOUR EXCELLENCY MUST KNOW THAT I BOUGHT A FARM FOR MY LIFE FROM SBIETTA-- TO CUT THE MATTER SHORT I RELATED THE WHOLE STORY IN DETAIL WITHOUT CONTAMINATING TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD
AFTER UNDERTAKING SOME NEW COMMISSIONS I TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THEM TO CHANGE MY MASTER
THE POPE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM HIM OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHICH I RELATED
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING-PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
BUT THIS AVAILED HIM NAUGHT
CX THOUGH I WANT TO ENTER UPON OTHER TOPICS AND TO LEAVE ALL THIS RASCALITY ALONE AWHILE I AM FORCED TO NARRATE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TERMINATION OF THIS FIVE YEARS CONTRACT
I ANSWERED THAT THE GREATEST REWARD I COULD DESIRE FOR MY LABOUR WAS TO HAVE SATISFIED HER LADYSHIP
I SHALL SPEND MY TIME IN THANKING GOD THAT HE HAS RESCUED HIM FROM THAT FATE. NOTE 1
I NEXT WENT TO THE DUKE WITH MY MEDAL WHICH WAS FINISHED
THESE WERE JUPITER VULCAN AND MARS
AND WANTING AT ONCE TO CUT THE MATTER SHORT CRIED OUT
YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR APPREHENSION. SO THE WHOLE MATTER PASSED OFF IN SMOKE AND I HEARD NOT ONE MORE WORD ABOUT IT
FIRST THEY SPOILT MY PIECE AND THEN THEY DID AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE
HAVING DICTATED THIS COMMISSION HE TURNED TO HIS TREASURER AND ASKED WHETHER HE HAD PAID ME THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS
AND AN ARTIST HAD CERTAINLY MORE TO EXPECT FROM IT THAN FROM THE REPUBLIC
LEAVING THEM HE RAN LIKE AN ARROW TO MY SHOP PROBABLY TO TAKE REVENGE UPON FELICE
SHE GAVE OUT THAT SHE WAS GONE BY CIVITà VECCHIA BUT SHE REALLY WENT BY OSTIA
SUCH WAS THE PITH OF MY DISCOURSE
BARTOLOMMEO DI GATTINARA
BOLOGNA WAS IN AN ECSTASY OF HAPPINESS AND THOUGHT HIMSELF SURE OF THE AFFAIR ALTHOUGH SUCH THINGS WERE NOT IN HIS LINE OF ART
MAI 1544
HE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF DUKE COSIMO ON THE 1ST OF AUGUST IN THIS YEAR 1537
THEN MY HEAT AND FEVER LEFT ME
PERHAPS THIS MARBLE WILL PROVE A STUMBLING BLOCK TO HIM FOR HE KEEPS ON PROVOKING ME AND DOES NOT BEAR IN MIND THE GREAT PERIL HE RAN UPON THE PIAZZA OF SAN DOMENICO
AND SHE HAD WITH HER A LITTLE SERVING-GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN
1 A CERTAIN PUPIL OF MY FATHERS MOVED BY HIS OWN BAD NATURE SUGGESTED TO THE CARDINAL THAT HE OUGHT TO SEND ME TO BOLOGNA IN ORDER TO LEARN TO PLAY WELL FROM A GREAT MASTER THERE
YOU SEE HIS MALADY HAS BEEN SO GRAVE THAT IF WE HAD BROUGHT HIM THE EXTREME UNCTION WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN IN TIME
NOR IS IT TRUE THE JAIL CAN TEACH THEE LORE TO FILL THY BREAST AND HEART WITH STRENGTH OF IT! NAY FOR MYSELF ILL EVER PRAISE IT MORE
AND HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD AND THAT IT HAD BEEN SEALED UP IN HIS PRESENCE AND ADDED THAT IT HAD STRUCK HIM AS A VERY ADMIRABLE PIECE
BUT FRIGHT MADE HIM TURN HIS HEAD ROUND
AND IN THE MEANWHILE HE ATTENDED TO THE CURE OF HIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG DAUGHTER
WHEN HE WAS UNABLE TO GRATIFY HER IN THIS MATTER OF REVENGE ON EITHER OF THE TWO PLANS HE HAD FORMED HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF ANOTHER WHICH SHALL BE RELATED IN ITS PROPER PLACE
VILE COWARD
GO MAKE THE BARGAIN
YOU HAVE SPOKEN WELL BUT IF YOU ACT OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE TO FEAR BECAUSE THE AFFAIR IS SERIOUS. UPON THIS I LEFT HIM AND BETOOK MYSELF TO THE KING
BEING A MAN OF INORDINATE HAUGHTINESS HE RATED THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD BOTH BECAUSE THEY HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AND ALSO BECAUSE HAVING BEGUN THEY HAD NOT GONE THROUGH WITH IT
SCORZONE IS ALSO THE NAME FOR A LITTLE BLACK VENOMOUS SERPENT
WE WILL OBEY YOUR LEAST COMMANDS SO LONG AS LIFE IS LEFT IN US. I BELIEVE THEY SPOKE THUS FEELINGLY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I MUST FALL SHORTLY DEAD UPON THE GROUND
I TELL YOU NO
I WENT TO MEET HIM AND CONDUCTED HIM THROUGH SEVERAL ROOMS WHERE DIVERS WORKS OF ART WERE ON VIEW
AND THE SAID MESSER GIOVANNI MADE SHOW OF MARVELLOUS ATTACHMENT TO LUIGI PULCIS TALENTS
HE WAS CONTINUALLY TALKING IN THE HIGHEST TERMS OF MY ACQUIREMENTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
SO IT HAPPENED ON THE LAST DAY OF JULY THAT I WAS REJOICING GREATLY BY MYSELF ALONE WHILE I BETHOUGHT ME OF THE FESTIVAL THEY KEEP IN ROME UPON THE 1ST OF AUGUST
THE LAD WHEN HE BEHELD HIMSELF CRIED OUT WITH A BURST OF ENTHUSIASM
I MUST HAVE MADE A MUCH LARGER FURNACE WITH A CONDUIT AS THICK AS MY LEG
SO I GOT SOME LITTLE CUPS MADE FOR HER IN SILVER NO LARGER THAN TWO PENNY MILK-POTS CHASED WITH EXQUISITE MASKS IN THE RAREST ANTIQUE STYLE
ACCORDINGLY FOR MY OWN GOOD HE CHASTISED ME A SECOND TIME WORSE EVEN THAN THE FIRST
THE ACCUSATION WAS BROUGHT AGAINST ME AND I RECEIVED A SUMMONS FROM THE COURT
SO SHE BEGAN WITH THAT BITING TONGUE OF HERS TO SAY THE WORST OF ME THAT COULD BE INSINUATED AGAINST A DEADLY ENEMY OF THIS MOST WORTHY CROWN OF FRANCE
AND BEING CLOSELY RELATED TO MESSER GUIDO GUIDI THE PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOW PROVOST OF PESCIA I LENT EAR TO HIS PROPOSALS
1 THIS MAN HAD ALWAYS PROFESSED MUCH FRIENDSHIP FOR ME IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY ON THAT OCCASION HE SHOWED HIS GOOD-WILL AFTER THE FRENCH FASHION WITH GREAT CLEVERNESS
BUT BEING A MAN OF GREAT TACT AND TALENT HE MADE A SHOW OF TURNING IT OFF WITH A LAUGH
THE SIGHT OF HIM DID ME A WORLD OF GOOD AND HE BEGAN TO CARESS ME AT ONCE SAYING HE HAD ONLY COME TO TAKE CARE OF ME IN PERSON
DARKNESS HAD COME ON
IN THEIR PRESENCE I DECLARED THAT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF GOLD AND MONEY I POSSESSED PERHAPS SOME EIGHT HUNDRED CROWNS WHAT WITH GOLD SILVER JEWELS AND CASH SHOULD BE GIVEN BY MY WILL TO MY POOR SISTER IN FLORENCE CALLED MONA LIPERATA
I AM GOING AWAY
SO THEN THE POPE HAS GIVEN ME BENVENUTO AND WISHES ME TO TAKE MY VENGEANCE ON HIM
THIS DIAMOND THE POPE COMMITTED TO MY CARE ORDERING ME TO MAKE A RING TO THE MEASURE OF HIS HOLINESS FINGER
HE WAS CALLED POMPEO AND WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO MESSER TRAJANO THE MOST FAVOURED SERVANT OF POPE CLEMENT
THE MARQUIS REMAINED STANDING APART LEANING AGAINST A PIECE OF TAPESTRY
THIS IS SOME OF THE SILVER FROM MY MINES
THIS WAS THE FIRST COIN WITH A HEAD IN FULL FACE ON SO THIN A PIECE OF SILVER THAT HAD YET BEEN SEEN
THAT SEEMED TO AUGMENT THE FURY OF HIS ANGER
WE LEFT ROME AND TOOK THE ROAD TO TAGLIACOZZO INTENDING TO VISIT MY PUPIL ASCANIO WHO LIVED THERE
AND BACHIACCA THE EMBROIDERER WHO WAS WORKING IN AN ADJACENT ROOM RAN UP AT THE NOISE
I SHALL SEND FOR TWO NOTARIES IN ORDER THAT THE MARRIAGE MAY BE RATIFIED BY CONTRACT. BIDDING CHIOCCIA GO FOR THE LAWYERS I TURNED TO THE GIRL AND HER MOTHER AND USING THE FRENCH LANGUAGE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
THE DEAR FRIEND ALSO WHO HAD HELPED ME IN SOME OF MY EARLIER TROUBLES AS I HAVE NARRATED I MEAN PIERO SON OF GIOVANNI LANDI)-HE TOO ADVISED ME TO MAKE SOME STAY IN FLORENCE
ZOUNDS
ZOUNDS
1 THE DOOR WAS DOUBLE AND THE CLINCHING OF THE NAILS COULD NOT BE SEEN
THIS WAS THE FIRST CHILD I EVER HAD SO FAR AS I REMEMBER
I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE ALESSANDRI WAS A MEMBER
UPON MY LIFE I NEVER DREAMED IT COULD BE ONE-TENTH PART SO BEAUTIFUL! THE DUKE REPLIED BY REPEATING MORE THAN ONCE
AND TAKING THE MISERABLE REMNANTS OF MY CLOTHES AND MONEY WENT TOWARD A GATE OF THE CITY
NOW WHEN I CAME TO THE POISON I REMARKED THAT IF I HAD EVER PROVED AN ACCEPTABLE SERVANT IN THE SIGHT OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY HE OUGHT NOT TO PUNISH SBIETTA OR THOSE WHO ADMINISTERED THE POISON BUT RATHER TO CONFER UPON THEM SOME GREAT BENEFIT INASMUCH AS THE POISON WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KILL ME BUT HAD EXACTLY SUFFICED TO CLEANSE ME OF A MORTAL VISCOSITY FROM WHICH I SUFFERED IN MY STOMACH AND INTESTINES
WHILE I WAS BOUND IN PRISON TO ABIDE FOISON OF PRIESTS FRIARS SOLDIERS I COULD SEE
WHEN I MELTED DOWN THE GOLD AND WORKED AT THE UNSETTING OF THOSE JEWELS YOUR HOLINESS ORDERED THE CAVALIERINO TO GIVE ME A MODEST REWARD FOR MY LABOURS OF WHICH I RECEIVED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE RATHER PAID ME WITH ABUSE
AMONG OTHERS I MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH A MOST EXCELLENT COMPANION A JEWELLER MESSER DOMENICO FONTANA BY NAME
HIS BROTHER MALATESTA UNDERTOOK TO DEFEND FLORENCE IN THE SIEGE OF 1530 AND SOLD THE CITY BY TREASON TO CLEMENT
AT EACH OF THE FOUR ANGLES OF THE FOUNTAIN A FIGURE WAS SITTING RAISED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE BASE AND ACCOMPANIED BY MANY BEAUTIFUL AND APPROPRIATE EMBLEMS
AFTERWARDS FEELING HIMSELF ILL REPAID FOR HIS SERVICES HE JOINED FILIPPO STROZZI IN HIS OPPOSITION TO THE MEDICEAN RULE AND WAS BEHEADED IN 1537 TOGETHER WITH HIS SON AND A NEPHEW
THE DUKE MY LATE HUSBAND PARTICULARLY ESTEEMED THIS MAN FOR HIS GOOD QUALITIES AND EMINENT ABILITIES
SFORZA ALMENI A PERUGIAN GENTLEMAN THE DUKES CHAMBERLAIN
THE MAN OFFERED TO SELL ME A FARM OF HIS FOR THE TERM OF MY NATURAL LIFE
AND THEN CAME SIGNOR ORAZIO BAGLIONI RUNNING
PUT HIM DOWN THERE BELOW THE GARDEN AND DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF HIM AGAIN FOR HE IS THE DESTINED CAUSE OF MY DEATH. SO I WAS TAKEN INTO A GLOOMY DUNGEON BELOW THE LEVEL OF A GARDEN WHICH SWAM WITH WATER AND WAS FULL OF BIG SPIDERS AND MANY VENOMOUS WORMS
BUT THIS NOT BEING SUFFICIENT I HAD TO PUT MY HAND INTO MY OWN PURSE IN ORDER TO PUSH THE WORK FORWARD AT SOMETHING BETTER THAN A SNAILS PACE
HE COULD NEVER RECONCILE HIMSELF TO THE MEDICEAN TYRANNY AND FINALLY TOOK REFUGE IN FRANCE WHERE HE WAS HONOURED BY FRANçOIS I
IT SEEMED INDEED AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON ME OR SPOKEN WITH ME AND THIS CAUSED ME TO AUGUR ILL OF MY FUTURE DEALINGS WITH HIS EXCELLENCY
ANGELO SEE ABOVE P
FOR I HAD ONLY TO CROSS THE RIVER THAT IS THE SEINE
I KEPT UPON THE LOOK-OUT FOR A CONVENIENT DAY
SO I ACCEPTED THE MONEY
BUT TOLD HIM THAT WHY THE MAN WAS CUT IN HALVES NEITHER HE NOR I COULD KNOW
THE POPE FEELING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SHAME AT SO WICKEDLY BREAKING HIS WORD TOOK WHAT SEEMED A MIDDLE COURSE
AT LAST THE CONVERSATION OF THOSE LOOSE WOMEN VEXED MY BEAUTY WHOM WE HAD CHRISTENED POMONA FOR THE NONCE
SIRE I BEG YOU TO LEAVE THAT TO ME
THEN HE TOOK THE VASE AND BASIN AND EXCLAIMED
THERE WE RESTED A WHOLE DAY THEN LEFT BETIMES ONE MORNING AND REACHED ANOTHER FAIR CITY CALLED SOLUTORNO
IT HAD JUST STRUCK TWENTY-FOUR AND HE WAS STANDING AT THE HOUSE-DOOR WITH HIS SWORD IN HAND HAVING RISEN FROM SUPPER
1 THESE OF A TRUTH ARE BY FAR THE FINEST THINGS IN ROME
1 I REPLIED
THE LETTER SO OVERFLOWED WITH EXPRESSIONS OF THE TENDEREST FATHERLY AFFECTION THAT I WAS MOVED TO TEARS OF FILIAL PIETY RESOLVING BEFORE HE DIED TO GRATIFY HIM AMPLY WITH REGARD TO MUSIC
WHEREFROM I GATHERED SOME HOPE THAT HE MIGHT REALLY BE A CONNOISSEUR OF ART
LET THE HOUSE BE SEEN TO AND WHO IS THE VENDOR AND AT WHAT PRICE
51 FOR THIS STORY
IN ORDER TO FIX THE BAND I GAVE IT THE FORM OF A STIRRUP
THEN HE TOOK UP A SPOON AND SAID HE WISHED TO HAVE HIS MOUTH LEFT OPEN ENOUGH TO TAKE THAT SPOON IN IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT RETURN ALIVE TO HIS OWN FOLK
BUT IN THOSE OF AMMANATO ITS FATE IS A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE. NOW I HAD RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THE DUKE TO MAKE A CLAY MODEL OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE MARBLE WOULD ALLOW
ALESSANDRO BECAME DUKE OF FLORENCE AND AFTER POISONING HIS COUSIN CARDINAL IPPOLITO WAS MURDERED BY A DISTANT COUSIN LORENZINO DE MEDICI
ON HEARING THE NEWS I WAS EXCEEDINGLY DISTRESSED
SO LET A SAFE-CONDUCT BE AT ONCE MADE OUT FOR HIM IN ORDER THAT HE MAY BE PLACED IN PERFECT SECURITY. A GREAT FRIEND OF POMPEOS WHO WAS ALSO INTIMATE WITH THE POPE HAPPENED TO BE THERE
AFTER NINE YEARS OF GOVERNMENT HE WAS BANISHED AND WHEN HE DIED MACHIAVELLI WROTE THE FAMOUS SNEERING EPITAPH UPON HIM
I WAS ENTERTAINED BY THEM TWO DAYS WITH INDESCRIBABLE KINDNESS
NOW MADAME DETAMPES DETAINED THE KING TILL NIGHTFALL WISHING TO DO ONE OF TWO MISCHIEFS EITHER TO PREVENT HIS COMING OR ELSE TO SPOIL THE EFFECT OF MY WORK BY ITS BEING SHOWN OFF AFTER DARK
1 I HAD MEANT TO TAKE THEM TO THE CARDINAL OF FERRARAS ABBEY AT LYONS
WHEN THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD RUN ME INTO A CERTAIN PASSAGE WHERE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THEIR HANDS I SUDDENLY MOUNTED MY PONY RESOLVED TO BE ROASTED OR BOILED ALIVE AT THAT PASS PERILOUS SEEING I HAD LITTLE HOPE TO EVADE ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE FATES
I THEREFORE IF I GAVE COMMISSION FOR THINGS OF SUCH MAGNITUDE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN I WAS LIKELY TO GET THEM. THE KING REPLIED THAT IF A MAN WAS SO SCRUPULOUS ABOUT THE TERMINATION OF A WORK HE WOULD NEVER BEGIN ANYTHING AT ALL
4 YOU MUST KNOW THAT AT ROME EVERY CARDINAL HAS A SEAL UPON WHICH HIS TITLE IS ENGRAVED AND THESE SEALS ARE MADE JUST AS LARGE AS A CHILDS HAND OF ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE
NOW UPON THE INSTANT LEAP ON HIM AND SECURE HIM WELL
A LITTLE EARLIER OR A LITTLE LATER WAS A MATTER OF SUPREME INDIFFERENCE TO ME
THEN I FACED ROUND TO HIS COUSINS AND SAID
MICHEL AGNOLO DELIGHTED IN HIS SOCIETY
THEN HIS HOLINESS COMMISSIONED ME TO DESIGN THE HISTORY OF MOSES WHEN HE STRIKES THE ROCK AND WATER ISSUES FROM IT WITH THIS MOTTO
HE WAS LIKE MANY OTHER OF THE LOMBARD ARTISTS AN EXCELLENT MASTER OF STUCCO
MOST BLESSED FATHER BENVENUTO HAS THIS VERY MOMENT MURDERED TOBBIA
HE SENT DAILY TO LEARN WHAT I WAS DOING
I ALSO UNDERTOOK ANOTHER HEAD OF THE SAME SIZE STUDIED FROM A VERY HANDSOME GIRL WHOM I KEPT FOR MY OWN PLEASURES
NOW IT CHANCED ONE EVENING THAT AN INTIMATE COMRADE OF MINE BROUGHT HOME TO SUPPER A BOLOGNESE PROSTITUTE NAMED FAUSTINA
I WILL ONLY TOUCH UPON A FEW OF THE MOST NOTABLE AND THE RAREST OF THESE CURIOSITIES
ONLY LET HIM GET ANOTHER TIME INTO OUR CLUTCHES! AND MY FATHER
HE RECEIVED ME MOST KINDLY AND INVITED US TO DINNER AND WE STAYED WITH HIM
INDEED HE OFTEN EXPRESSED A WISH TO LEAVE ME REMEMBERING THAT HE RAN NO LITTLE RISK OF PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING TREATED MY CASE OR RATHER FOR HAVING PROCEEDED TO THE END WITH IT
WHEREVER I MAY BE SO LONG AS I HAVE LIFE I WILL PRAY GOD FOR YOU. THE CARDINAL WAS GREATLY IRRITATED AND CRIED OUT IN A RAGE
THESE HONEST MEN WILL GET THE CHANNELS READY
IT WAS BROUGHT OUT ON CHRISTMAS EASTER AND S
THE SIGHT DROWNED REASON IN RAGE AND I DREW MY SWORD RESOLVED TO KILL THEM BOTH
BUT HERE AM I WITH FIVE DAUGHTERS AND AS MANY SONS AND WHEN MY RECKONING IS MADE THIS IS AS MUCH AS I CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD. GIOVANNI WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING AWHILE UNSEEN BY THEM SUDDENLY BROKE IN AND SAID
AFTERWARDS WHEN I ONCE MORE SHUT IT OFF FROM VIEW EVERY DAY BROUGHT SONNETS WITH LATIN AND GREEK VERSES
NOW I WANT TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER TO BENVENUTO AND CAN THINK OF NO BETTER INTERMEDIARY THAN YOUR WORSHIP
ASCANIO SHRIEKED OUT
GIAN BOLOGNA OR JEAN BOULLOGNE WAS BORN AT DOUAI ABOUT 1530
WHEREFORE PRINCES WHO PROVIDE SUCH FOLK WITH COMPETENCES LET YOUR HOLINESS TAKE NOTICE ARE WATERING THE ROOTS OF GENIUS
WHEN I PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE THEIR EXCELLENCIES THE DUCHESS ADDRESSED ME IN A VERY PLEASANT TONE
YOUR MAJESTY SHALL SEE A MODEL OF THE SORT EVEN SOONER THAN YOU HAVE COMMANDED
HAVING NOW ASCERTAINED HOW SUCCESSFULLY MY WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED I LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING TO PISA WHERE I FOUND THE DUKE
INSTEAD OF ABIDING BY THEIR PROMISED WORD THOSE TWO ROGUES DECLARED THEY MEANT TO GIVE ME UP MY FARM AND WOULD NOT KEEP IT ANY LONGER UPON LEASE
BEFORE WE BEGIN TO TALK WE MUST DRINK TOGETHER FOR SUCH IS THE FRENCH CUSTOM. I ANSWERED
AND I WISHED TO GO ALONE BUT WAS UNABLE ON ACCOUNT OF A LAD IN MY SERVICE CALLED ASCANIO
ABOVE THIS GROUP THE SEA SAT THRONED IN AN ATTITUDE OF PRIDE AND DIGNITY
HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO GAMBETTA THE MOTHER OF MY APPRENTICE CENCIO
MY MENACING ATTITUDE COULD NOT BE KEPT UP FOR EVER
HENCEFORTH I ATE THE VICTUALS SENT ME BY THE BISHOP AND CONTINUED WRITING MY CAPITOLO ON THE PRISON INTO WHICH I INSERTED DAILY ALL THE NEW EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED TO ME POINT BY POINT
I THINK THE POOR LAD SWORE THIS OATH TO GOD WITH ALL HIS HEART FOR HE DID BREAK HIS NECK AS I SHALL PRESENTLY RELATE
AND THE YOUTH POSSESSED EXTRAORDINARY GIFTS FOR POETRY TOGETHER WITH SOUND LATIN SCHOLARSHIP
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A FATHER BETTER THAN YOU ARE AND ALL THINGS WHICH A GOOD SON IS BOUND TO PERFORM FOR A GOOD FATHER WILL I EVER DO FOR YOU. SO THEN I TOOK MY DEPARTURE ATTENDED BY A SERVANT AND A LITTLE FRENCH LAD
SHE WAS HERSELF A FRENCH LADY OF DISTINGUISHED FAMILY
IF YOU HAD COME A LITTLE EARLIER TO ROME I SHOULD HAVE COMMISSIONED YOU TO RESTORE MY TWO TIARAS WHICH WERE PULLED TO PIECES IN THE CASTLE
THOSE OF US WHO HAD NO FAMILIARITY WITH WOMEN OF THE TOWN WERE FORCED TO PURVEY THEMSELVES AT NO SMALL TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN ORDER TO APPEAR WITHOUT DISGRACE AT THAT DISTINGUISHED FEAST OF ARTISTS
HE WAS GRAVE AND OF A NOBLE PRESENCE AND SPOKE SLOWLY AT HIS EASE
THERE AT THE TOWNGATE I MET SER FILIPPO WHO APPEARED TO KNOW ALREADY WHITHER I WAS BOUND
WHEN I SAW THE UNFORTUNATE BENEDETTO STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND I THOUGHT AT ONCE OF THE PERIL I WAS IN CONSIDERING THE POWER OF MY ENEMIES AND WHAT MIGHT ENSUE FROM THIS DISASTER
SO HE ALTERED EVERYTHING WHICH HAD BEEN ARRANGED
THE UPSHOT WAS THAT WHAT WITH THE DOG AND WITH THOSE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF RELEASING THEIR PRISONER
THEN LOOKING ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE HE ADDED
3 POURING FORTH A TORRENT OF ABUSE HE ROARED OUT THAT HE WAS SURPRISED AT HIMSELF FOR HAVING LET ME SPEAK AT ALL TO A MAN OF HIS QUALITY
A GREAT DILETTANTE OF THE ARTS BUT ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SATISFY AND WHO IF THEY CHANCE TO STUMBLE ON SOMETHING WHICH SUITS THEIR TASTE EXALT IT SO IN THEIR OWN FANCY THAT THEY NEVER EXPECT TO SEE THE LIKE OF IT AGAIN
WHAT A MIRACLE OF A MAN
AND THIS YOU MAY ASSURE HIM WITHOUT RESERVATION. NOTE 1
2 THIS WORTHY MAN SHOWED ME THE GREATEST COURTESY AND LET ME GO FREE ABOUT THE CASTLE ON PAROLE
AFTERWARDS I TOOK THEM TO THE CARDINAL WHO THANKED ME GREATLY
BUT I GOT IT VERY WELL IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND AS WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL
2 NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY KNOWS WHAT IT HAS COST YOU
THE COMPANY AT SUPPER ROSE IMMEDIATELY AND CAME DOWN ENTREATING ME IN A BODY TO REFRAIN FROM PUTTING MYSELF AND THEM TO INCONVENIENCE FOR A STRUMPET
THEN HE ASKED IF I HAD A MIND TO SERVE HIM
BUT LORENZINO NEVER SAID ANYTHING EXCEPT
YOU KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD
YOU SEE THAT THE QUALITIES WE DISCERNED IN HIM ARE COMPANIED BY VIRTUES AND NOT VICES. THEY BOTH EXPRESSED THEIR ADMIRATION AND THEN MADONNA PORZIA CONTINUED
AND IF AT LAST HE COULD DO NOTHING ELSE HE MUST ORDER ME TO TAKE THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS TO HIS JEWELLER POMPEO
EACH TIME THAT HE DESCRIBED MY TRUCULENT BEHAVIOUR THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ATTITUDES I HAD ASSUMED AND REPEATING THE WORDS WHICH I HAD USED HE CALLED UP SOME FRESH DETAIL TO MY MEMORY
ON THE OTHER SIDE I BOUGHT A LITTLE PONY BECAUSE THE BAGGAGE WHICH I CARRIED HAD SOMEWHAT OVERTIRED MY HORSES
MARGARET OF AUSTRIA NATURAL DAUGHTER OF CHARLES V WAS EVENTUALLY MARRIED IN 1536 TO ALESSANDRO DE MEDICI
DISMOUNTING AT HIS HOUSE WE PROCEEDED TO THE PIAZZA WHERE I RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE THAT MY BROTHER WAS ALIVE AND WENT TO FIND HIM AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND OF HIS CALLED BERTINO ALDOBRANDINI
INDEED HE IS TOO TRUCULENT BY FAR TOO CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS
THE FISH-STONE OR PIETRA DEL PESCE WAS THE MARKET ON THE QUAY WHERE THE FISH BROUGHT FROM THE SEA UP THE ARNO TO PISA USED TO BE SOLD
SUCH BENEFITS I ADDED WERE INSCRIBED UPON THE BOOK OF GOD BEFORE ANY OTHER GOOD ACTIONS
IF THEN AS I THINK PROBABLE THE FACTS ARE QUITE CONTRARY TO THOSE ASSERTIONS OF CARDINAL GADDI REPLY TO ME WITHOUT DELAY UPON THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER
NEXT FIND A PIECE OF BRICK UPON THE FLOOR CRUMBLE A PART THEREOF TO POWDER SMALL AND FORM A PASTE BY SPRINKLING WATER OER
OF ITS VIOLENCE AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF ITS ZEAL FOR FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP OF ITS ABOUNDING VITALITY ITS VERSATILITY AND ITS IDEALISM
SO THEN YOU VALUE NEITHER MY HELP NOR MY OPPOSITION? ON THE CONTRARY I VALUE THEM HIGHLY PRINCESS
AND HIS HOLINESS ORDERED ME TO TAKE ALL THE GEMS OUT OF THEIR GOLD SETTINGS
XXXVI WHILE I WAS AT WORK UPON THAT DIABOLICAL TASK OF MINE THERE CAME FROM TIME TO TIME TO WATCH ME SOME OF THE CARDINALS WHO WERE INVESTED IN THE CASTLE
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS SERVANTS HE INSISTED UPON TAKING HIS FLIGHT ALSO FROM THE TOWER SAYING THAT NO ONE COULD RECAPTURE ME EXCEPT HIMSELF IF HE WERE TO FLY AFTER ME
IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE POPE HAD COUNTED ON SOME WANT OF MONEY OR OTHER OPPORTUNITY PREVENTING ME FROM BRINGING SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AT ONCE AND WAS ANXIOUS IN THIS WAY TO REPIECE THE BROKEN THREAD OF MY OBEDIENCE
MARCO CORNARO WAS A BROTHER OF CATERINA THE QUEEN OF CYPRUS
ACCORDINGLY I ASKED HIM HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE AND WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO
AROUND HIM WERE MANY KINDS OF FISHES AND OTHER CREATURES OF THE OCEAN
6 I AGAIN ASKED HIM TO SETTLE MY AFFAIRS
THE HORSE LIKE MOST OF HIS KIND BEING NOT DEVOID OF REASON SEEMED TO HAVE AN INSTINCT OF MY INTENTION
THESE WORDS HE UTTERED WITH A CERTAIN LOOK WHICH IMPLIED THAT SUCH ENTERPRISES WERE NOT FOR FOLK OF LITTLE SPIRIT
HE DIED AT TRENTO IN 1563 WHILE PRESIDING OVER THE COUNCIL THERE IN THE PONTIFICATE OF PIUS IV
SO NOW THE TIME HAS COME TO HELP ME
MY LORD WHAT CAN PREVENT THIS COMING TO THE EARS OF THE DUCHESS? THE DUKE LIFTED HIS HAND IN SIGN OF TROTH-PLEDGE 1 AND EXCLAIMED
SO HE GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL PAID
HE RAN TO ARMS
BOTH OF THEM WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH MY WORK AND TREATED ME SO KINDLY THAT BEING SOMEWHAT EMBOLDENED I PROMISED THE JEWEL SHOULD BE TWICE AS GOOD AS THE MODEL
THE MEMORANDUM RAN AS FOLLOWS
HE WAS DUKE OF BRACCIANO FATHER OF DUKE PAOLO WHO MARRIED ISABELLA DE MEDICI AND MURDERED HER BEFORE HIS SECOND MARRIAGE WITH VITTORIA ACCORAMBONI
THE KING COULD NOT SWALLOW THE DISPLEASURE HE FELT AT MY DEPARTURE
MEANWHILE HE PROMISED TO GIVE ME ANOTHER SAFE-CONDUCT WHICH SHOULD KEEP ME IN SECURITY UNTIL THAT TIME
AH VERY SON OF GOD
ON THE INSTANT I DID NOT KNOW CECCHINO SINCE HE WAS WEARING A DIFFERENT SUIT OF CLOTHES FROM THAT IN WHICH I HAD LATELY SEEN HIM
THE DUCHESS KEPT URGING ME TO DO GOLDSMITHS WORK FOR HER
I GAVE THE WOMAN A STRAW HAT OF THE VERY FINEST TEXTURE THE LIKE OF WHICH SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD NEVER SEEN
ON MY APPEARANCE HE RECEIVED ME WITH UNBOUNDED MARKS OF ESTEEM AND AFFECTION AMONG WHICH HE TOOK OCCASION TO REMARK TO THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT THAT I WAS THE FIRST ARTIST OF THE WORLD IN MY OWN LINE AND THAT I HAD BEEN FOR A LONG WHILE IN PRISON AT ROME
THEN I AIMED IT EXACTLY AT THE MAN IN RED ELEVATING PRODIGIOUSLY BECAUSE A PIECE OF THAT CALIBRE COULD HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO CARRY TRUE AT SUCH A DISTANCE
SO THEN I SHALL ASK YOU TO KEEP WATCH OVER TWO MATTERS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE WHICH MIGHT PROVE A SOURCE OF MUCH ANNOYANCE TO ME
AND THE REASON WHY THE FIRST AND LAST REMAINED ENTIRE WAS THAT THE FIRST SHOULD SYMBOLISE THE GREAT GIFT GOD HAD GIVEN HIM NAMELY OF A HUMAN SOUL INFLAMED WITH HIS DIVINITY THE WHICH HATH NEVER BROKEN WHILE THE SECOND REPRESENTED THE GLORIOUS RENOWN OF HIS BRAVE ACTIONS
AT THE SAME TIME HE WENT ON PROTESTING THAT HE ACTED ALTOGETHER IN MY INTEREST AND AS MY SUPPORTER
INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TOP I FASHIONED THREE FIGURES OF A FAIR SIZE IN THE ROUND
BUT I SHOULD HAVE TO DILATE TOO LONG UPON THE TOPIC WERE I TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RASCALITIES THEY PRACTISED ON ME
THE DAY FOLLOWING I WENT TO SLEEP THERE AFTER WELL PROVIDING MYSELF WITH CLOTHES AND ALL THINGS REQUISITE SINCE I INTENDED TO GO AND THANK THE POPE NEXT MORNING
IN COURSE OF TIME A VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT GREW OUT OF THIS MISUNDERSTANDING THROUGH HER DESIRE TO TAKE REVENGE FOR THE AFFRONT I HAD PUT UPON HER
BUT WHEN HE PRESSED THE CROWNS UPON ME I STILL OFFERED SOME RESISTANCE
AND LOOKING ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE HE ADDED
HE REJOINED
RIDING UP TO HIM THEN AND LEAVING MY YOUNG MEN AND COMPANIONS AT A LITTLE DISTANCE I COURTEOUSLY ADDRESSED HIM
I WILL TELL YOU IN GODS NAME
YOU OUGHT BY THE WAY TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SENT THAT LABOURER AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS A SCOUNDREL. THE LABOURER IN QUESTION BORE THE NAME OF MARIANO ROSEGLI
THAT I WAS A BETTER MAN THAN HE IN EVERY RESPECT BUT THAT IF HE KEPT ON IRRITATING ME I WOULD GIVE HIM HARDER KICKS THAN ANY DONKEY COULD
OH JUST GOD THOU PAIDEST ALL OUR DEBTS UPON THAT HIGH-RAISED CROSS OF THINE
HE COMMISSIONED THE ENVOY TO TELL HIS EXCELLENCY THAT THE CASTLE OF S
3 HAVING SENT WORD TO HIS EXCELLENCY THAT I WISHED TO SET OFF FOR VENICE WITH HIS GOOD LEAVE SIGNOR COSIMINO DE MEDICI NOW DUKE OF FLORENCE RETURNED WITH THE ANSWER THAT I MUST GO TO NICCOLò DE MONTE AGUTO WHO WOULD GIVE ME FIFTY GOLDEN CROWNS WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY BESTOWED ON ME IN SIGN OF HIS GOOD-WILL AND AFTERWARDS I MUST RETURN TO SERVE HIM
AND YOU BIG THIEF WHO ARE EGGING THEM ON I MEAN TO KILL YOU FIRST. HE CLAPPED SPURS TO THE JENNET HE WAS RIDING AND TOOK FLIGHT HEADLONG
SO ON THE FIRST OF AUGUST DID THAT TRAIN DISLODGE ME TO A TOMB MORE FOUL MORE COLD NOVEMBER DAMNS AND DOOMS EACH ROGUE TO PAIN! 12 I AT MINE EARS A TRUMPET HAD WHICH TOLD TRUTH
BUT SINCE IT DID NOT YIELD THE PURITY OF LUSTRE WHICH ONE EXPECTS IN SUCH A DIAMOND ITS OWNERS HAD CROPPED THE POINT AND IN TRUTH IT WAS NOT EXACTLY FIT FOR EITHER POINT OR TABLE CUTTING
THE DUKE AMUSED HIS LEISURE HOURS BY CLEANING UP THESE STATUETTES HIMSELF WITH CERTAIN LITTLE CHISELS USED BY GOLDSMITHS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF HIS MAJESTY ALLOWS YOU THREE HUNDRED CROWNS A YEAR YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOURSELF VERY WELL INDEED FURTHERMORE I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE YOURSELF IN MY HANDS FOR EVERY DAY OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SOME SERVICE IN THIS GREAT KINGDOM AND I SHALL EXERT MYSELF WITH VIGOUR IN YOUR INTEREST. THEN I BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
ONE DAY THIS FRIEND SAID TO ME
HE HAD JUST LEFT THE SERVICE OF SOME BISHOP WHOSE NAME I DO NOT REMEMBER AND WAS THOROUGHLY TAINTED WITH A VERY FOUL DISEASE
MINE WERE BROUGHT ME BY ONE OF THE KINGS CHIEF SECRETARIES MESSER ANTONIO MASSONE 2 THIS GENTLEMAN PRESENTED THEM WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF KINDNESS FROM HIS MAJESTY SAYING
THERE NEVER PASSED A DAY BUT WHAT I KILLED ONE OR ANOTHER OF OUR ENEMIES IN THE BESIEGING ARMY
THE MEDICEAN ARMS WERE OR SIX PELLETS GULES THREE TWO AND ONE. THE FLORENTINE COMMUNE BORE ARGENT A CROSS GULES. NOTE 4
AND SO WHILE SOOTHING AND CARESSING ME HE CUT ITS TAIL AND MOUTHS OFF
THEY HAD AMONG THEM TWO LANCES AND I HAD BOUGHT A STOUT PIKE IN FERRARA
1 HAVING SPENT SOME TIME OVER AN EXCELLENT LUNCH IT WAS PAST TWENTY OCLOCK WHEN I REACHED VICCHIO
THE RASCAL OF A GROOM WHOM I HAD SENT REPLIED THAT HE HAD DONE SO BUT THAT THEY HAD ANSWERED THAT THEY COULD NOT COME
SEND FOR THE WORK AT ONCE AND DONT WAIT FOR A SECOND ORDER. I RESPONDED
XXVI I HAD TO DEAL IN LIKE MANNER WITH ANOTHER FELLOW BUT I DID NOT RUIN HIS HOUSE
THEY HAVE TORCHES AND A THOUSAND THINGS BESIDES WITH THEM! I ANSWERED
I ALSO SENT SOME OF THE SPLINTERS WHICH I HAD PRESERVED BY THE HAND OF ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FOR HIM TO SEE
THE POPE HOWEVER SHOWED LITTLE DISPOSITION TO GIVE ME UP
FOR THIS WOULD BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE
WHEN I STOOD UPON MY FEET ON SOLID EARTH I LOOKED UP AT THE VAST HEIGHT WHICH I HAD DESCENDED WITH SUCH SPIRIT AND WENT GLADLY AWAY THINKING I WAS FREE
THE REMAINDER OF CELLINIS LIFE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT MORE PEACEFUL
LXXXV ABOUT THIS TIME THE WAR OF SIENA BROKE OUT 1 AND THE DUKE WISHING TO FORTIFY FLORENCE DISTRIBUTED THE GATES AMONG HIS ARCHITECTS AND SCULPTORS
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CROWNS WERE TO BE MY COMMISSION ON THE BARGAIN AND THE DUCHESS HAD INTIMATED THAT I SHOULD RECEIVE SO MUCH
I COMPLAINED TO THE POPE WHO TOLD ME NOT TO BE UNEASY FOR HE KNEW HOW EVERYTHING HAD HAPPENED AND HOW WELL I HAD CONDUCTED MYSELF IN ADDRESSING THE EMPEROR AND OF THE MONEY I SHOULD CERTAINLY OBTAIN MY SHARE
FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT I WAS DEAD AND I HAD HEARD THAT HE WAS DEAD
THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB BETOOK THEMSELVES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS EACH TO HIS OWN BUSINESS
HE PERFORMED THE MUSIC BETTER THAN ALMOST ALL THE REST WHICH SO ASTONISHED THE COMPANY THAT GIULIO AND MICHEL AGNOLO DROPPED THEIR EARLIER TONE OF BANTER EXCHANGING IT FOR WELL-WEIGHED TERMS OF SOBER HEARTFELT ADMIRATION
I LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND LIKE A DEAD MAN AND COULD HEAR WHAT THE BYSTANDERS WERE SAYING
AND THAT HE INTENDED TO MAKE IT UP TO ME HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAW I WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS WHO IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE MIGHT DECAMP WITHOUT COMPLAINING OR ASKING LEAVE
THE KING I THOUGHT WOULD TAKE MUCH PLEASURE IN THEIR SIGHT
I CRIED
MASTER A MAN OF BRONZE OR MARBLE MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
AND HAVING THUS OPENED THE CONVERSATION I GRADUALLY INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF THAT NOBLE BLOCK OF MARBLE I HAD SEEN
CHRIST THE GLORIOUS AND DIVINE ELECTS ME TO THE COMPANY OF HIS DISCIPLES AND FRIENDS WHO LIKE HIMSELF WERE CONDEMNED TO DIE UNJUSTLY
THE ELDERS UPON THIS CONSIDERATION IN CONCERT WITH MY OWN ANCESTORS REMOVED CRISTOFANO
CARDINAL GIOVANNI SALVIATI WAS ARCHBISHOP OF FERRARA
297
MY LORD YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY MUST PLEASE TO KNOW THAT BACCIO BANDINELLO IS MADE UP OF EVERYTHING BAD AND THUS HAS HE EVER BEEN
THE DOG UNABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH AN ARMED MAN RAN SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH THE HOUSE AND RUSHED INTO THE ROOMS OF THE JOURNEYMEN WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN BECAUSE OF THE GREAT HEAT
NOR WERE THE PIECES COUNTED OUT UNTIL THREE HOURS AFTER NIGHTFALL
SO WE TOOK GOOD HORSES AND SET OUR FACES IN THE DIRECTION OF ROME PASSING THE SIMPLON AND TRAVELLING FOR SOME WHILE IN THE COMPANY OF CERTAIN FRENCHMEN
BY PREACHING AGAINST THE MEDICI IN FLORENCE
I THEN PROCEEDED TO RECKON IN MY OWN CASE TOO ON GODS ASSISTANCE BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS DIVINE POWER AND MERCY AND ALSO BECAUSE OF MY OWN INNOCENCE
YOU MAY GO AND TELL IT TO WHOM YOU LIKE
NOW LET YOUR HOLINESS DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST ABOUT HIM
THE GOOD TREASURER HANDED ME A HUNDRED CROWNS IN GOLD
AS SOON AS I HAD GONE THE FATHERS AND SONS RAN TO THE EIGHT AND DECLARED THAT I HAD ASSAULTED THEM IN THEIR SHOPS WITH SWORD IN HAND A THING WHICH HAD NEVER YET BEEN SEEN IN FLORENCE
MY PRINCESS LEAVE THE MATTER IN MY HANDS. THEN THE RASCAL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE DUKE WITH THAT NECKLACE IN HIS HANDS
THIS IS JUST THE SAME AS WITH YOUR PERSEUS WHEN YOU ASKED THOSE TEN THOUSAND CROWNS
MARRIED EMMANUELE FILIBERTO DUKE OF SAVOY IN 1559
I BEG YOU THEN TO DEIGN TO LISTEN TO ME UPON THIS MATTER OF YOUR FORTIFICATIONS WHICH IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAKING STATUES
ALFONSON DAVALOS SUCCESSOR AND HEIR TO THE FAMOUS FERDINANDO DAVALOS MARQUIS OF PESCARA
HE AFTERWARDS BECAME ONE OF THE GREAT SOLDIERS IN THE SCHOOL OF THAT MARVELLOUS GENERAL GIOVANNINO DE MEDICI FATHER OF DUKE COSIMO
1 IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SUN WAS FULLY IN THE HEAVENS THERE ASSEMBLED SUCH A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE THAT NO WORDS COULD DESCRIBE THEM
ON THE DAY WHEN I SHOT IT THE PIGEON SCARCELY SHOWED ITS HEAD BEING SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO OFTEN FIRED AT
FILIPPO STROZZI WAS LEADER OF THE ANTI-MEDICEAN PARTY NOW IN EXILE
1 NOTE 1
1 NOTE 1
1 NOTE 1
1 NOTE 1
ARMED WITH THESE DOCUMENTS I HAD RECOURSE TO THE LORDS COUNSELLORS
FOR HE HAD NEVER MET WITH ANCIENT PIECES OF THAT SIZE
XXIII WHILE I WAS PUSHING FORWARD SALAMANCAS VASE I HAD ONLY ONE LITTLE BOY AS HELP WHOM I HAD TAKEN AT THE ENTREATY OF FRIENDS AND HALF AGAINST MY OWN WILL TO BE MY WORKMAN
THE LANDI AMONG OTHER NOBLEMEN OF THE DUCHY TOOK PART IN A CONSPIRACY WHICH HAD ITS GROUND IN PIER LUIGIS POLITICAL ERRORS NO LESS THAN IN HIS INTOLERABLE MISGOVERNMENT AND INFAMOUS PRIVATE LIFE
DO US HONOUR AND IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU. NOTE 1
ACCORDINGLY HE DID SO FOR SOME TIME TO AMUSE HIMSELF UNTIL BY CONSTANT IMPORTUNITY THEY INDUCED HIM TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THEIR BAND
YOU RISK YOURSELF TOO MUCH ALONE
HE WANTED TO SEND FOR MAESTRO FRANCESCO BUT I TOLD HIM NOT TO DO SO BUT TO COME CLOSE UP TO ME BECAUSE THAT OLD MAN WAS AFRAID OF HIM AND WENT AWAY AT ONCE
LO
OH ME
JUST THEN GIOVAN BANDINI CAME UP AND SAID TO THEM
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THE HOUSE BY HIS EXCELLENCY AND THAT HIS LORDSHIP HIMSELF IN THE NAME OF HIS EXCELLENCY HAD GIVEN THE ORDERS TO LATTANZIO GORINI
AND THIS PRECIOUS PAIR TOGETHER--THAT KNAVE OF A PEDANT AND THAT ROGUE OF A STRUMPET--INVENTED A SCHEME FOR GIVING ME SUCH A FRIGHT AS WOULD MAKE ME LEAVE FLORENCE IN HOT HASTE
IF YOU DO NOT YOU WILL HAVE A FATHERS CURSE
THEY RESOLVED ON MIXING POUNDED DIAMOND WITH MY VICTUALS
FOR BERTINO RECEIVED SOME UGLY WOUNDS AND FELL
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SERVICE AND FOR OTHER REASONS THE WORTHY MAN CONCEIVED FOR ME AS MUCH LOVE OR MORE AS HE HAD FOR TWO MALE CHILDREN
BUT THAT THINGS LIKE THAT ON WHICH I WAS NOW ENGAGED WERE NOT COMMISSIONED EVERY DAY
124
THEN I RETURNED TO THE DUKE AND RELATED THE WHOLE UNPLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI AND ME ENTREATING HIS EXCELLENCY NOT TO ALLOW THE FINE COINS WHICH I HAD MADE FOR HIM TO BE SPOILED AND BEGGING FOR PERMISSION TO LEAVE FLORENCE
THE SCUDI DI MONETA WAS WORTH 10 GIULIOS CELLINI WAS PAID IN GOLDEN CROWNS WHICH HAD A MUCH HIGHER VALUE
IN 1551 HE SCHEMED TO WITHDRAW SIENA FROM THE SPANISH TO THE FRENCH CAUSE AND WAS DECLARED A REBEL
MAGALOTTI IS SAID TO HAVE DISCHARGED HIS OFFICE WITH EXTREME SEVERITY AND TO HAVE RUN GREAT RISKS OF HIS LIFE IN CONSEQUENCE
ON THE WAY THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO WAS THE MOST GENTLE-MANNERED PERSON IN THE ROMAN COURT TOLD ME THAT THE POPE NOT ONLY WANTED TO SEE WHAT I WAS DOING BUT ALSO INTENDED TO INTRUST ME WITH ANOTHER TASK OF THE HIGHEST CONSEQUENCE WHICH WAS IN FACT TO FURNISH DIES FOR THE MONEY OF THE MINT
MY LORD I HAVE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING FOR I HAVE HERE A PUPIL OF MINE A YOUNG ROMAN WHOM I HAVE TAUGHT THE ART
HE DREW BACK A LITTLE NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN SHOW OF FEAR AND CALLED OUT
JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
1 DURING A PORTION OF THAT NIGHT I KEPT RACKING MY BRAINS WHAT THE CAUSE COULD BE WHY GOD THOUGHT FIT TO TRY ME SO AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER IT I WAS VIOLENTLY AGITATED IN MY SOUL
BUT THE FRAY HAD HARDLY BEGUN WHEN A CROWD OF PERSONS INTERVENED WHO RATHER TOOK MY PART THAN NOT HEARING AND SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE RIGHT
WHEN THE DUKE SAW HIM HIS COUNTENANCE CONTRACTED AND HE ASKED HIM DRILY
NOW YOU HAVE NO ANSWER LEFT
NOTE 11
FOR THAT VERY REASON WILL I PUT HEART AND HOPE INTO HIM. THE CARDINAL ASHAMED AT HIS OWN MEANNESS SAID
AND BADE HIS CONSTABLES TAKE GOOD CARE NOT TO STRIKE AGAINST MY BROKEN LEG BUT TO TREAT ME AS THOUGH I WERE THE APPLE OF THEIR EYE
HAVING ALREADY ACCESS TO HIS HOLINESS EAR HE TOOK INTO HIS COUNSEL ANOTHER JEWELLER NAMED POMPEO A MILANESE WHO WAS IN FAVOUR WITH THE POPE AND RELATED TO MESSER TRAIANO THE FIRST CHAMBERLAIN OF THE COURT
FOR THIS PURPOSE I MIXED SOME RUST WHICH I HAD SCRAPED FROM OLD IRON WITH A LITTLE WAX OBTAINING EXACTLY THE SAME COLOUR AS THE HEADS OF THE LONG NAILS WHICH I HAD EXTRACTED
GO THEN MY BENVENUTO AND DEVOTE YOURSELF WITH SPIRIT TO MY SERVICE AND DO NOT LEND AN EAR TO THE CHATTERING OF THESE SILLY FELLOWS. SO I WENT OFF AND VERY QUICKLY MADE TWO DIES OF STEEL
BUT THIS FELLOW WAS AN INSIGNIFICANT COUNTRY LAD WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY HIS LORDSHIP
THIS HE OVERLAID WITH WAX AND THEN TOOK A HOLLOW MOULD OF THE FIGURE THUS FORMED
SO THEN I WILL RESUME THE THREAD OF MY DISCOURSE CONCERNING HIM AND THE GREAT THINGS I WROUGHT FOR HIM
HOWEVER I BEGGED HIM TO CONDESCEND TO HEAR ME AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS WILLING
THEN COMING OUT EXACTLY AT THE CHURCH OF SANTO AGNOLO WE GOT WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY TO THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE
MESSER LUIGI APROPOS OF THIS SALT-CELLAR MADE AN ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION OF HIS OWN IDEA
THIS WAS THE AGREEABLE DIDACTIC POET LUIGI ALAMANNI WHO HAD TO FLY FROM FLORENCE AFTER A CONSPIRACY AGAINST CARDINAL GIULIO DE MEDICI IN 1522
IS THAT THE NOISE YOUR FILTHY TALENTS MAKE? AND RAN OFF FOR A CUDGEL
6 I TOOK MY WAY FROM THENCE TO THE INN AND MET BY ACCIDENT A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GIOVANNI RIGOGLI
2 THE DUKE THEN WISHING TO BE ABLE TO RETIRE INTO A LESS PUBLIC PART OF THE PALACE FITTED UP FOR HIMSELF A LITTLE CHAMBER IN THESE NEW LODGINGS AND ORDERED ME APPROACH TO IT BY A PRIVATE PASSAGE
AT THAT TIME HE SOJOURNED IN THE HOUSE OF MESSER GIULIANO BUONACCORSI AND HAVING NOWHERE ELSE TO GO FOR PASTIME WITHOUT THE GREATEST PERIL OF HIS LIFE HE USED TO SPEND A LARGE PART OF THE DAY IN MY HOUSE WATCHING ME WORKING AT THE GREAT PIECES I PRODUCED THERE
AND WHAT BERNARDONE SAID ABOUT THE TOOLS HE LENT ME IS A LIE
AMONG THESE THERE WAS ONE WITH EIGHT PANELS CARRIED OUT WITH FAR MORE SCIENCE THAN THE REST AND WHICH SEEMED TO ME MORE FITTED FOR THE PURPOSE
THE SIENESE TOOK HIS WORDS ILL AND DISMISSED HIM ON THE SPOT
NOW THIS FIORINO TOOK UP HIS QUARTERS UNDER THE HILL OF FIESOLE ON THE GROUND WHERE FLORENCE NOW STANDS IN ORDER TO BE NEAR THE RIVER ARNO AND FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE TROOPS
THEREFORE I THOUGHT FIT TO LEAVE HIM IN THE CUSTODY OF ALL MY GOODS AS ALSO OF MY HONOUR
I CONSTRUCTED THAT FURNACE ANEW ON PRINCIPLES QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER FOUNDERS
SO LONG AS THEY REMAINED INTACT THEY WERE THE SCHOOL OF THE WORLD
AT THE HOUR OF TWENTY-TWO FIASCHINO ARRIVED AND GAVE ME THE DIAMOND OF SIXTY CROWNS OF WHICH I SPOKE ABOVE
AND IT STANDS ME IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CROWNS WHICH I HAVE PAID OUT OF MY POVERTY
THE FIRST WAS CALLED GIROLAMO THE SECOND BARTOLOMMEO THE THIRD GIOVANNI WHO WAS AFTERWARDS MY FATHER AND THE FOURTH FRANCESCO
LXXXIX WE MOUNTED AND RODE RAPIDLY TOWARD ROME
CATTIVANZA WAS A NICKNAME
I MADE USE OF THE LAD AS A MODEL FOR THE ONLY BOOKS WHICH TEACH THIS ART ARE THE NATURAL HUMAN BODY
CARDINAL BENEDETTO ACCOLTI ARCHBISHOP OF RAVENNA WAS THEN STAYING AT FERRARA
SO HE SAID TO THE DUKE
1 HIS MAJESTY HAD THEREFORE OTHER THINGS THAN PLEASURE TO ATTEND TO
HE WHO ROBS ME OF MY PROPERTY AND LABOUR MAY TAKE MY LIFE TOO AND WELCOME. WHILE I WAS CARRYING ON THIS DEBATE IN MY OWN MIND A CROWD OF SPANIARDS ARRIVED LED BY THEIR MAJOR-DOMO WHO WITH THE HEADSTRONG RASHNESS OF HIS RACE BADE THEM GO IN AND TAKE THE VASE AND GIVE ME A GOOD BEATING
HE WAS A MILANESE CALLED MESSER AMBROGIO
HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY DELIGHTED AND SAID
MICHELE BEING JERONIMOS FRIEND AND ASCANIOS ENEMY CALLED OUT
I FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET FREE OF THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO INSISTED UPON GOING WITH ME WHATEVER HAPPENED
THIS MAN WAS INTIMATE WITH THE POPE WHO TOOK GREAT PLEASURE IN HEARING HIM TALK
BENVENUTO SHOULD YOU HAVE THE HEART TO COIN FALSE MONEY? TO THIS I REPLIED THAT I THOUGHT I COULD DO SO BETTER THAN ALL THE RASCALS WHO GAVE THEIR MINDS TO SUCH VILE WORK
THESE INSINUATIONS OPERATED SO EFFICIENTLY UPON THE DUKES ILLUSTRIOUS EARS THAT PART OF MY ALLOWANCE FOR WORKPEOPLE WAS WITHDRAWN
IN HIS FIERY PACE THE BEAST RAN UP IT
XLV I TOOK THE MONEY AND THE MODEL HOME AND WAS IN THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE TO BEGIN MY WORK
AND STOPPING WHERE WE WERE HE TOLD ME THAT I HAD DONE WRONG TO LEAVE FRANCE
AH GOD
HE MADE NO REPLY BUT CONTINUED EYEING THE DUKE WITH VERY EVIL GLANCES
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
COME HERE
THERE WOULD BE MUCH TO SAY UPON THIS TOPIC
WHO IS THE MASTER WHO MADE THAT GOOD PORTRAIT OF YOU IN SO FINE A MANNER
ACCORDINGLY HE COMMANDED AND BESOUGHT ME TO DO MY UTMOST TO PRODUCE SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL
LET NO ONE CONTRADICT ME FOR IN CASES LIKE THIS WE NEED THE AID OF HAND AND HEARING NOT OF ADVICE. WHEN I HAD UTTERED THESE WORDS A CERTAIN MAESTRO ALESSANDRO LASTRICATI BROKE SILENCE AND SAID
E YOUR UGLY VISAGE
UPON THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS COMMISSION THE CARDINAL SENT FOR ME AFTER SUPPER AND TOLD ME THAT HIS MAJESTY WAS RESOLVED TO LET ME BEGIN WORKING BUT THAT HE WANTED ME FIRST TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MY APPOINTMENTS
THIS IS THAT WHEN I CHARGED MY GUN WITH POWDER WEIGHING ONE-FIFTH OF THE BALL IT CARRIED TWO HUNDRED PACES POINT-BLANK
IF I STOPPED TO WORK FOR THE KING OF FRANCE IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE BETTER FOR ME TO HAVE ITALIANS BY ME AND IN PARTICULAR SUCH PERSONS AS I KNEW TO BE CAPABLE OF GIVING ME ASSISTANCE
WHEREUPON BEING GUARANTEED BY SOME ROMAN NOBLEMEN OF HIGH DEGREE THAT THE PRELATE WOULD NOT HARM ME AND HAVING ASSURANCE THAT I SHOULD BE PAID I ARMED MYSELF WITH A LARGE PONIARD AND MY GOOD COAT OF MAIL AND BETOOK MYSELF TO HIS PALACE WHERE HE HAD DRAWN UP ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD
IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE RELATED ALL THE FAVOURS SHOWN HIM BY HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY AND ASKED ME WHAT GREAT WORKS I HAD IN HAND
CELLINI THEREFORE GIVES HIM THIS TITLE AS DUKE OF CASTRO
AFTER THE DUKE HAD INSPECTED THEM I PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD SELECTED THE LEAST BEAUTIFUL
NOW A CERTAIN MAN FELL IN HER WAY WHO ENJOYED GREAT FAME AS A DISTILLER
I TOLD POMPEO
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEDAL
THIS I INTENDED TO RECEIVE THE PEPPER
BUT THEY BADE ME GIVE GOOD HEED TO MY OWN PROCEEDINGS 1 FOR THE FINE HEADS I MEANT TO CAST IN MY ITALIAN FASHION WOULD NEVER SUCCEED
IT IS TO THIS THAT CELLINI PROBABLY REFERS IN THE CAUTIOUS PHRASE WHICH ENDS THE CHAPTER
BELOW HIM WERE HIS FOUR SEA-HORSES FASHIONED LIKE OUR HORSES FROM THE HEAD TO THE FRONT HOOFS
IT IS A BUTTON FOR MY PRIESTS COPE WHICH HAS TO BE MADE ROUND LIKE A TRENCHER AND AS BIG AS A LITTLE TRENCHER ONE-THIRD OF A CUBIT WIDE
BUT THAT I DARED SWEAR THAT I SHOULD SUCCEED WITH EASE IN MAKING HIS LUBBERLY LUMBER WHILE HE WOULD NEVER BE SUCCESSFUL IN MY BROTHEL GEWGAWS
MOREOVER HE ALLOWED ME TO EMPLOY MYSELF AS I LIKED BEST WITH GOLD OR SILVER OR WITH WAX ACCORDING TO MY WHIM
HE FELL TO THE GROUND AT ONCE IN A DEAD FAINT
AND HE ORDERED ME NOT TO SPEAK A WORD UNDER PAIN OF THEIR DISPLEASURE AND TO PERFORM THE SENTENCE THEY HAD PASSED
YOU HEAR WHAT CATERINA DEPOSES BENVENUTO. I REPLIED
DEUCE TAKE IT
THIS OTTAVIANO WAS NOT DESCENDED FROM EITHER COSIMO OR LORENZO DE MEDICI BUT FROM AN ELDER THOUGH LESS ILLUSTRIOUS BRANCH OF THE GREAT FAMILY
OH MY GOOD LORD WILL YOUR LORDSHIP PLEASE TO TELL ME HOW ONE CAN MAKE BREAD WITHOUT FLOUR
PRINCE WHEN MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI DISPLAYED HIS SACRISTY TO VIEW WITH SO MANY FINE STATUES IN IT THE MEN OF TALENT IN OUR ADMIRABLE SCHOOL OF FLORENCE ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE OF TRUTH AND GOODNESS PUBLISHED MORE THAN A HUNDRED SONNETS EACH VYING WITH HIS NEIGHBOUR TO EXTOL THESE MASTERPIECES TO THE SKIES
3 DURING THAT TIME I WENT TO DRAW SOMETIMES IN MICHEL AGNOLOS CHAPEL AND SOMETIMES IN THE HOUSE OF AGOSTINO CHIGI OF SIENA WHICH CONTAINED MANY INCOMPARABLE PAINTINGS BY THE HAND OF THAT GREAT MASTER RAFFAELLO
1 I HAD MADE SOME PROPOSALS TO THE POPE WHICH I THINK HE WOULD HAVE AGREED UPON AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO RETURN TO ROME ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES WHICH I HAD AT FLORENCE
AND THIS COMMUNICATED BY A LITTLE DARK PASSAGE WITH THE MAIDS BEDROOM
FEDERIGO GINORI WHO ENJOYED HIS FRIENDSHIP BROUGHT HIM OFTEN TO MY WORKSHOP AND THROUGH THIS INTRODUCTION WE BECAME VERY INTIMATE TOGETHER
A CONTRACT VALID AND IN DUE FORM WAS DRAWN UP
BUT FOR RECREATION AFTER SUCH STUPENDOUS LABOURS AND FOR THE LOVE OF ME WHO AM YOUR FATHER WHO BEGAT YOU AND BROUGHT YOU UP AND IMPLANTED SO MANY HONOURABLE TALENTS IN YOU FOR THE SAKE OF RECREATION I SAY WILL NOT YOU PROMISE SOMETIMES TO TAKE IN HAND YOUR FLUTE AND THAT SEDUCTIVE CORNET AND TO PLAY UPON THEM TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT INVITING THE DELIGHT OF MUSIC? I PROMISED I WOULD DO SO AND VERY WILLINGLY FOR HIS LOVES SAKE
HIS MAJESTY FEELING THAT I SET TOO LITTLE STORE UPON HIS UNWONTED AND EXTRAORDINARY CONDESCENSION COMMANDED ME WITH A GREAT AND TERRIBLE VOICE TO HOLD MY TONGUE UNLESS I WANTED TO INCUR HIS WRATH
BUT FIRST HE WISHED ME TO BRING THE BOOK IN THE STATE TO WHICH I HAD ADVANCED IT
DIRECTING MY STEPS ALONG THE STRADA GIULIA I TURNED INTO CHIAVICA AND AT THIS CORNER CRESPINO THE BARGELLO WITH ALL HIS CONSTABLES MADE UP TO ME AND SAID
HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A CITIZEN AND WAS RETURNING FROM THE RELIGIOUS FUNCTIONS PROPER TO THAT DAY
AND I RETORTED
HE REGARDED THIS AS A VERY BAD OMEN AND COULD HARDLY BE PREVAILED UPON TO UNDERTAKE MY CURE
P

MADONNA FRANCESCA IT IS MY MASTER WHO HAS MADE ME SO HANDSOME AND FAR MORE GOOD TO BOOT. IN HER PETTY SPITEFUL WAY SHE TOOK IT VERY ILL THAT ASCANIO SHOULD SPEAK SO
HOW THE CAKE BEGAN TO STIR BENEATH THAT AWFUL HEAT TO GLOW AND SPARKLE IN A BLAZE
AT LAST I WAS OBLIGED TO TREAT THEM WITH CONTEMPT AND USE THIS LANGUAGE
LXXVII WHEN I HAD THUS PROVIDED AGAINST THESE SEVERAL DISASTERS I ROARED OUT FIRST TO ONE MAN AND THEN TO ANOTHER
GOD GRANT YOU MAY HAVE THE POWER TO EXECUTE ALL HE ORDERS. I REPLIED THAT I DESIRED NOTHING MORE THAN WORK TO DO AND WOULD RATHER TAKE IT FROM THE DUKE THAN FROM ANY MAN WHATEVER IN THE WORLD
HE CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF PRATO AND HAD BEEN AN APOTHECARY IN THE TOWN THERE
SO I CUT A PIECE OFF TIED IT TO THE POLE AND CLAMBERED DOWN THE WALL ENDURING THE UTMOST TOIL AND FATIGUE
AND HAVING SHOWN AS THE PIECE ITSELF PROVED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART WAS FINISHED I BEGGED HIM TO ADVANCE ME FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PARTLY ON ACCOUNT AND PARTLY BECAUSE I WANTED GOLD TO COMPLETE THE CHALICE
HAVE THEM ALL EXHIBITED TO THE SCHOOL
BUT SHE WITH THE MERE PETTY WILL TO VEX ME BADE ME WAIT
BATTISTA SANGA A ROMAN SECRETARY TO GIANMATTEO GIBERTI THE GOOD ARCHBISHOP OF VERONA AND AFTERWARDS TO CLEMENT VII
I HAD INDEED FLUNG A GAUZE VEIL WITH ELEGANCE AND DELICACY OVER A PORTION OF MY STATUE WITH THE VIEW OF AUGMENTING ITS MAJESTY
AND AT THE VERY FIRST I HANDED HIM SBIETTAS MEMORANDUM EXPECTING THAT THIS WOULD BE RECITED IN THE DEED
THE REAL DIFFICULTY IS TO EXECUTE THIS IN GOLD. TO THOSE WORDS I ANSWERED WITHOUT MOMENTS HESITATION
SHOULD YOU NOTICE ANYTHING TELL IT ME AT ONCE
HAD I BUT FOUND HIM OUT MY VENGEANCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY TROY WEIGHT
PIERO SODERINI WAS ELECTED GONFALONIER OF THE FLORENTINE REPUBLIC FOR LIFE IN THE YEAR 1502
PAUL III
THE CARDINAL SAID TO MY FATHER THAT IF HE SENT ME THERE HE WOULD GIVE ME LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION AND SUPPORT
BEHOLD THE END TO WHICH SO RARE A GENIUS HAS COME! ROUSED BY THESE WORDS I OPENED MY EYES AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF PRIESTS WITH LONG GOWNS ON THEIR BACKS WHO WERE SAYING
SO HIS EXCELLENCY COMMISSIONED HIM TO MAKE DESIGNS FOR THE FORTIFICATIONS OF THE GATES AND SENT EACH OF US HIS OWN GATE DRAWN ACCORDING TO THE PLAN
I TELL YOU FOR A CERTAINTY THAT THE REGISTERS ON WHICH ARE WRITTEN ALL THE JEWELS OF THE POPE AND THE REGALIA MUST BE PERFECTLY IN ORDER
MOST BLESSED FATHER YOUR HOLINESS OUGHT NOT TO GO SO FAST
SO HE REJOINED
2 WELL THEN MESSER GUIDO CAME TO PARIS
XCI THE POPE ORDERED OUT TWO TURKISH HORSES WHICH HAD BELONGED TO POPE CLEMENT AND WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THAT EVER CAME TO CHRISTENDOM
ALSO THAT I CHOSE TO GO LIKE A FREE JOURNEYMAN WHERE IT PLEASED ME KNOWING I DID WRONG TO NO MAN
BY THIS MEANS AND BY PILING ON WOOD AND STIRRING NOW WITH POKERS AND NOW WITH IRON RODS THE CURDLED MASS RAPIDLY BEGAN TO LIQUEFY
THAT MORNING I ATE HEARTILY FOR I HAD FASTED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
IT WAS TWO HOURS BEFORE DAYBREAK WHEN AT LAST I REMOVED THOSE HINGES WITH THE GREATEST TOIL
THE POPE MEANT TO GIVE IT TO KING FRANCIS
HOWEVER I FINISHED IT AND JUDGED IT ABOUT THE FINEST SPECIMEN I HAD PRODUCED IN ALL THE POINTS PERTAINING TO MY ART
NOW PAGOLO MICCERI HAVING LEARNED HOW TO KEEP THEM FROM HIS BROTHER WENT ON DOING THIS WORK FOR ME IN RETURN FOR A LIBERAL SALARY
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE BURGHERS OF FLORENCE WERE DIVIDED INTO INDUSTRIAL GUILDS CALLED THE GREATER AND THE LESSER ARTS
AND I ALTHOUGH I AM AN AMATEUR AND JUDGE OF ART COULD NEVER HAVE CONCEIVED THE HUNDREDTH PART OF ITS BEAUTY. THE LORDS WHOSE CUE IT WAS TO SPEAK AGAINST ME NOW SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PRAISE MY MASTERPIECE ENOUGH
I SHOULD BE CALLED FELICE GAIN-LITTLE IF YOU HAD NOT ENABLED ME TO ACQUIRE SUCH CREDIT THAT I CAN CALL MYSELF GAIN-MUCH. I REPLIED THAT THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF GAINING
MY MOST ILLUSTRIOUS MISTRESS I ENTREAT YOU FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TO TELL THE POPE THAT HE MUST SEND SOME ONE ELSE TO PRONOUNCE SENTENCE UPON BENVENUTO AND PERFORM MY OFFICE
THE RESCRIPT RAN AS FOLLOWS
WHEN I PERCEIVED HOW GREATLY HE WAS DISAPPOINTED I BADE ONE OF MY SISTERS BRING ME A FLUTE
NOT SATISFIED WITH HAVING MADE HIM TAKE A VICIOUS DRAB TO WIFE I COMPLETED MY REVENGE BY INVITING HER TO SIT TO ME AS A MODEL AND DEALING WITH HER THUS
AND I PUT THE AXE IN SOLELY THAT I MIGHT NOT BE UNMINDFUL TO REVENGE HIM
THESE SELECT CRAFTSMEN I WORKED TO THE BONE WITH PERPETUAL LABOUR
WHEN DAY BROKE I USED IMMEDIATELY TO SWEEP MY ROOM OUT
THE VASE WAS ADORNED WITH TWO FINE HANDLES TOGETHER WITH MANY MASKS BOTH SMALL AND GREAT AND MASSES OF LOVELY FOLIAGE IN AS EXQUISITE A STYLE OF ELEGANCE AS COULD BE IMAGINED
IF YOU MEAN TO GO ON IN THIS WAY I SHALL PRESENTLY LET YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MY OWN METHOD OF PROCEDURE WHEN I CHOOSE TO HAVE THINGS DONE IN MY OWN WAY
MARIA SOPRA MINERVA AT ROME
AND CARDINAL FARNESE FORMERLY MY FRIEND AND PATRON HAD DECLARED THAT I OUGHT NOT TO RECKON ON ISSUING FROM THAT PRISON FOR SOME LENGTH OF TIME
SINCE HE LEFT US WITHOUT ANY CAUSE I SHALL NOT RECALL HIM
AND BECKONING TO HIS SERVANT SENT HIM HOME TO FETCH A JUG IN WHITE FAENZO CLAY THE WORKMANSHIP OF WHICH WAS VERY EXQUISITE
THERE WE HALTED AT THE INN OF THE PIAZZA WHICH LAMENTONE WENT IN SEARCH OF SOME FLORENTINE EXILES TO TAKE THEM LETTERS AND MESSAGES FROM THEIR WIVES
HAVING THUS SECURED MY BED FROM MEDDLERS I FELT AS THOUGH THE MAIN POINT WAS GAINED
FOR I OUGHT TO ADD THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE CAME TO TERMS WITH ALBIZZI THE DUKE HAD SHOWN HE WAS EXCESSIVELY DISPLEASED WITH ME
FOR THE GREAT LOVE I BORE ANGELICA HAD COME BACK TO MY MIND AND WHILE I WAS CONVERSING NOT WITHOUT SOME LOVERS SIGHS UPON THIS SUBJECT WITH SOLOSMEO WE SAW THE MAN RETURNING TO US AT A GALLOP
THEN AFTER SEEING THAT IT CONTAINED NOTHING BUT GOLD I RETIRED TO ONE END OF THE COUNTER AND KEEPING MY EYES LOWERED AND MAKING NO NOISE AT ALL I LIFTED IT WITH BOTH HANDS SUDDENLY ABOVE MY HEAD AND EMPTIED IT LIKE A MILL HOPPER
THEREFORE WE MUST BE QUICK AND TRY TO SAVE ME FROM HIS CLUTCHES
UPON THIS THE TWO YOUNG MEN CAME RUNNING OUT
THEN I TURNED MY FACE TOWARDS ROME TAKING ASCANIO WITH ME
THAT DEVIL BENVENUTO WILL NOT BROOK REBUKE
TAKE YOUR GEMS AWAY FOR I AM SO TREATED HERE THAT I HAVE NO LIGHT TO SEE BY EXCEPT WHAT THIS MURKY CAVERN GIVES AND THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO TEST THE QUALITY OF PRECIOUS STONES
IT COUNTED A GREAT MULTITUDE INCLUDING THE FLOWER OF HIS HORSE
BENVENUTO YOU SHALL HAVE ALL THE ACCOMMODATIONS YOU CAN ASK FOR
I WILL SPEND THE TIME IN RELIGIOUS EXERCISES WHILE I KEEP WATCH OVER THE PREMISES
BUT HE PROMISED WHEN CASH CAME IN TO DISCHARGE ARREARS
XC I NOW BEGAN TO ATTEND TO MY SHOP AND DID SOME BUSINESS NOT HOWEVER OF MUCH MOMENT BECAUSE I HAD STILL TO THINK ABOUT MY HEALTH WHICH WAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AFTER THAT GRAVE ILLNESS I HAD UNDERGONE
FOR NONE ON EARTH HAS THE POWER TO DO ME HARM HENCEFORWARD
MOST BLESSED FATHER THE FAVOURS YOU ARE SHOWERING UPON THIS YOUNG MAN AND HE BY NATURE SO EXTREMELY OVERBOLD ARE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM PROMISE YOU A NEW WORLD
AND SIR PIER MARIA DEL LOTTO THE ENVOY FROM FLORENCE WAS WITH HIM TO WHOM HE SPECIALLY RECOMMENDED ME AS HIS MAN
AT ONE TIME IT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO SET FIRE TO HIS HOUSE
WHEREFORE IF IT CHANCES TO ENTER THE STOMACH TOGETHER WITH FOOD THE PERISTALTIC MOTION 2 NEEDFUL TO DIGESTION BRINGS IT INTO CONTACT WITH THE COATS OF THE STOMACH AND THE BOWELS WHERE IT STICKS AND BY THE ACTION OF FRESH FOOD FORCING IT FARTHER INWARDS AFTER SOME TIME PERFORATES THE ORGANS
THE PEACE OF CRéPY WAS CONCLUDED SEPTEMBER 18 1544
THEN TORE THE VEIL TO PIECES WITH VEXATION
BENVENUTO IS A COUNTERFEIT BAT BUT I AM A REAL ONE
THEN INSTEAD OF THE COLUMNS DEMANDED BY THIS DISPOSITION OF PARTS I FASHIONED TWO SATYRS ONE UPON EACH SIDE
TO-MORROW I SHALL SET OUT FOR VALLOMBROSA THENCE TO CAMALDOLI AND THE ERMO AFTERWARDS I SHALL PROCEED TO THE BAGNI DI SANTA MARIA AND PERHAPS SO FAR AS SESTILE BECAUSE I HEAR OF FINE ANTIQUITIES TO BE SEEN THERE
I AM CONVINCED THIS WAS NOT TRUE AND INDEED I WAS HEARTILY SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES. THESE WORDS HE KEPT PILING UP AND REPEATING UNTIL HE SEEMED TO BE BEGGING MY PARDON
THIS PRIESTLY SORCERER MOVED ME SO BY HIS PERSUASIONS THAT I WAS WELL DISPOSED TO COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST
WHEN HE SAW ME HE GAVE ME A VERY GRACIOUS RECEPTION AND SHOWING SOME SURPRISE EXCLAIMED
A WARM PARTISAN OF THE MEDICI
THEN SINCE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD ACQUITTED MYSELF WITH MORE HONOUR THAN I HAD EXPECTED I TOOK THE OCCASION OF A SLIGHT LULL IN THE CONVERSATION TO MAKE MY BOW AND TO RETIRE
PER QUELLA BELLA FONTE HERE AND BELOW CELLINI MIXES UP FONTAINEBLEAU AND THE SPRING WHICH GAVE ITS NAME TO THE PLACE
IT IS I WHO RULE THE WORLD TO-DAY AND A LITTLE FELLOW LIKE THAT SNAPS HIS FINGERS AT ME
AND AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE DESIGN OF THE GREAT LIONARDO WAS ITSELF MOST ADMIRABLY BEAUTIFUL

YOU WERE RIGHT IN CONJECTURING THAT SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE HAD HAPPENED AT FLORENCE. JUST THEN FRANCESCO SODERINI APPEARED JOGGING ALONG UPON A WRETCHED MULE HE HAD AND LAUGHING ALL THE WAY LIKE A MADMAN
AT LAST BREAKING INTO LAUGHTER AT THE LONG TALE I WAS TELLING HE SENT ME OFF WITH THESE WORDS
I WAS AWARE OF THE WOUND IN MY HEAD BEFORE I KNEW MY LEG WAS BROKEN
I AGREED AND SENT HIM TO RETOUCH MY MEDUSA WHICH HAD BEEN NEW CAST IN BRONZE
AND NEXT DAY I WENT TO KISS THE HAND OF MESSER PIETRO BEMBO WHO WAS NOT YET A CARDINAL
THEN I TOOK HIM IN A PLEASANT MANNER BY ONE EAR AND DREW HIM BEFORE A GREAT LOOKING-GLASS
MANY OF THEM WENT AWAY IN TERROR
I HAD NOT GONE THREE MILES BEFORE I FELT AS THOUGH MY STOMACH WAS ON FIRE AND SUFFERED SUCH PAIN THAT IT SEEMED A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I ARRIVED AT TRESPIANO
IF SUCH AN ACCIDENT SHOULD HAPPEN HAVING THESE THINGS IN THE KEEPING OF THE CARDINAL I SHALL NOT LOSE THEM. WELL TO CUT THE STORY SHORT I SENT BACK THE MULE WITH THE VASES AND OTHER THINGS OF IMPORTANCE
FOR HIS EXCELLENCY ALSO MEANS BANDINELLO TO HAVE IT. WHEN THE DUCHESS HAD SPOKEN THE DUKE WHO HAD KEPT SILENCE UP TO THIS TIME SAID
THIS COMING TO THEIR EARS THEY THREATENED TO MAKE ME SORELY REPENT OF SUCH WORDS
THESE TWO CARTOONS STOOD ONE IN THE PALACE OF THE MEDICI THE OTHER IN THE HALL OF THE POPE
THE COMPANY THUS HAVING REGAINED CONFIDENCE WE DINED TOGETHER VERY GAILY
MY BENVENUTO I WAS DEEPLY GRIEVED FOR YOUR MISFORTUNE AND KNEW WELL THAT YOU WERE INNOCENT BUT COULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU IN SHORT IT WAS MY FATHER WHO CHOSE TO GRATIFY SOME ENEMIES OF YOURS FROM WHOM MOREOVER HE HEARD THAT YOU HAD SPOKEN ILL OF HIM
MICHEL AGNOLO HAD PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN GIULIO AND GIOVAN FRANCESCO
THAT BENVENUTO OF YOURS BEFORE HE WAS IMPRISONED CAME TO WORDS WITH A GENTLEMAN OF CARDINAL SANTA FIORE 2 ABOUT SOME TRIFLE WHICH THE LATTER HAD SAID TO HIM
SO THEN YOU TAKE NO PLEASURE IN PLAYING? TO WHICH I ANSWERED NO; BECAUSE THAT ART SEEMED TOO BASE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT I HAD IN MY OWN MIND
ALL MY BUSINESS THERE I LEFT IN THE HANDS OF MY PARTNER FELICE
THERE WERE MORE MEN ENGAGED UPON THE FORMER THAN I HAD AT MY DISPOSAL FOR THE LATTER SO THE SALT-CELLAR WAS BY THIS TIME COMPLETELY FINISHED
CELLINI CALLS THIS GROSSERIA NOTE 2
THITHER THEN I WENT TO PAY HIM MY RESPECTS WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF ACTING AS DUTY REQUIRED FIRST BECAUSE I WAS A FLORENTINE AND NEXT BECAUSE MY FOREFATHERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN ADHERENTS OF THE MEDICEAN PARTY AND I YIELDED TO NONE OF THEM IN AFFECTION FOR THIS DUKE COSIMO
I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING I HAD DONE A DAMAGE OF MORE THAN FIFTY CROWNS
THEY ENJOYED THEIR YOUTH AND WEDDED LOVE THROUGH EIGHTEEN YEARS ALWAYS GREATLY DESIRING TO BE BLESSED WITH CHILDREN
A CHI LARD AVERE FOR WHOMSOEVER IT IN GOING TO BELONG TO
NOTE 10
HIS REVERENCE PAID ME WELL AND BADE ME RETURN TO ROME TO THAT MARVELLOUS CITY WHERE WE HAD MADE ACQUAINTANCE
AND IN ORDER THAT THE LINE OF BREAKAGE MIGHT NOT BE OBSERVED I WREATHED THAT GARLAND OF FLOWERS ROUND IT WHICH MAY STILL BE SEEN UPON THE BOSOM
WITH MY LEFT HAND I PLUCKED BACK THE DAGGER AND WITH MY RIGHT HAND DREW MY SWORD TO DEFEND MY LIFE
THEN HE COMMISSIONED THE ARCHBISHOP OF CAPUA TO SEND FOR ME AND ASK IF I HAD ANY OTHER NEED BEYOND THIS MATTER GIVING HIM FULL LEAVE TO ABSOLVE ME AMPLY AND BIDDING HIM MOREOVER TREAT ME WITH THE UTMOST KINDNESS
A FEW DAYS LATER WHEN THE RAGE OF THE RIVER WAS SPENT I RETURNED TO MY WORKSHOP AND FINISHED THE PIECE WITH SUCH GOOD FORTUNE THROUGH GODS GRACE AND MY OWN GREAT INDUSTRY THAT IT WAS HELD TO BE THE FINEST MASTERPIECE WHICH HAD BEEN EVER SEEN IN ROME
FOR A BAND OF MEN HAD BEEN SENT FORWARD WELL ARMED TO DO ME MISCHIEF THERE
ALL THESE THINGS TONING THEM DOWN A TRIFLE I WROTE TO THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WHO RELATED THEM AT ONCE TO THE KING
THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT BENVENUTO IS A PERSON OF VERY REMARKABLE GENIUS
DO YOU NOTICE THAT THE CROCKERY THEY GIVE YOU IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST
THE FATHERS OF BOTH OF THEM BEING WELL ACQUAINTED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS EASY TO MAKE THIS MATCH UP
THIS WORTHY MAN HAD A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG DAUGHTER WITH REGARD TO WHOM HE HAD DESIGNS ON ME
AND WHEN I REACHED FERRARA I WROTE WORD TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE DUKE THAT THOUGH I HAD GONE OFF WITHOUT BEING SENT I SHOULD COME BACK AGAIN WITHOUT BEING CALLED FOR
GO GO
SO THEN RAFFAELLO CAME TO LOOK ME UP AND SPOKE TO THIS EFFECT
THERE WAS A MAN CALLED PILOTO A GOLDSMITH VERY ABLE IN HIS ART WHO TOGETHER WITH MYSELF JOINED BUONARROTI UPON THESE OCCASIONS
DO YOU MAKE IT YOURS TO ACQUIRE EXCELLENCE IN YOUR ART
ON THE CONTRARY I AM AFRAID THAT ALL ITS DEFECTS WILL THEN BE BROUGHT HOME TO HIM AND MORE WILL BE DETECTED THAN THE STATUE REALLY HAS
I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY ABOUT HIM WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW
O GIANNOTTO YOU WHO WERE ONCE MY FRIEND-FOR HAVE WE NOT BEEN TOGETHER IN SUCH AND SUCH PLACES AND DRAWN AND ATE AND DRUNK AND SLEPT IN COMPANY AT YOUR HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
INDEED IT CONFIRMS MY OPINION THAT THE COMMENTATORS MAKE HIM SAY THINGS WHICH NEVER CAME INTO HIS HEAD
CHE MI FERMASSI UNA PROVVISIONE NOTE 3
FOR THE PRELATES ANGER HAD COOLED AND HE PROPOSED TO RATIFY A PEACE BETWEEN ME AND LUIGI AND THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD PERSONALLY NO QUARREL WITH ME AND ONLY WISHED TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
HE TOLD ME TO GO HOME AND HE WOULD COME IMMEDIATELY
AND THE MODERN ARTIFICERS OF WHOM I SPEAK FASHIONED FROM THE FOLIAGE WHICH THEY COPIED MONSTERS OF LIKE NATURE
AT LAST THEY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT THREW MY SAFE-CONDUCT ON THE GROUND AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT THEIR PRIZE
NOW I WAS RETURNING TO A BETTER KINGDOM WITH THE GRACE OF GOD THE WHICH I THOUGHT I HAD MOST CERTAINLY ACQUIRED
1 THEN I REJOINED
THE DUKE IS AT CASTELLO! THEN TURNED HIS BACK AND LEFT ME
LV WHEN I HAD NEARLY FINISHED MY PIECE THERE HAPPENED THAT TERRIBLE INUNDATION WHICH FLOODED THE WHOLE OF ROME
SO WE SPOKE FOR SOME LENGTH UPON THIS TOPIC
YOU TALK VERY CONFIDENTLY OR RATHER FAR TOO ARROGANTLY
AND AFTER A FEW DAYS WHEN HE WAS GOING TO EXTRACT A PORTION OF THE DISEASED BONES HER FATHER CALLED FOR ME AND BEGGED ME TO BE PRESENT AT THE OPERATION
THERE IS NO HARM DONE
AND WHILE I WAS EXAMINING THEM I REMEMBERED THAT THE FOOD I ATE THAT MORNING HAD SCRUNCHED MORE THAN USUAL
JUST THEN A FERRARESE NOBLEMAN NAMED MESSER ALFONSO DE TROTTI ARRIVED
FOR BEFORE HE WENT TO ROME WE OFTEN WENT TO DRAW TOGETHER AND HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE COMRADES
THEN I TOOK THE RING IN HAND AND FINISHED IT WITHIN A FEW DAYS
THE SHAMELESS STRUMPET CASTING HER EYES UPON THE YOUNG MANS BEAUTY BEGAN AT ONCE TO LAY HER NETS FOR HIM
HER INDIGNATION ABOUT THE PEARLS AND NOW AGAIN ABOUT THIS MATTER OF THE STATUES MADE HER SO CONTRIVE THAT THE DUKE ABANDONED HIS AMUSEMENTS IN OUR WORKSHOP
MY BENVENUTO YOU HAVE SATISFIED AND DELIGHTED ME
AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IN ADDITION TO HIS INTEMPERATE HABITS OF LIFE THE MORTIFICATION OF HAVING PROBABLY TO LOSE THE MARBLE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DECLINE
GOD HELP US
LET THE WORLD SAY WHAT IT CHOOSES. THE GOOD CARDINAL ENTREATED HIS HOLINESS TO GIVE HIM THE BISHOPRIC AND FOR THE REST TO THINK THE MATTER OVER AND THEN TO ACT ACCORDING AS HIS HOLINESS DECIDED
THE BOY REPLIED THAT CENCIO HAD BEEN FAR MORE ILL THAN I WAS AND THAT HE WAS EVEN AT DEATHS DOOR
I HAD OFTEN COPIED THEM GAINING THEREBY MUCH HONOUR FROM THE WORKS IN WHICH I USED THEM
DIRECTLY HE SET EYES ON ME HE ASKED WHAT ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED TO UPSET ME SO
HE TOLD ME VERY GRACIOUSLY THAT HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED AND THAT HE WOULD GRANT ME MY REQUEST
I ROSE AT ONCE AND WENT TO MEET THEM
THEN I SAID MY NAME WAS BENVENUTO
FOR THEN HED KNOW ALL A GOOD RULER CAN
ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE HAD LEARNED MY BUSINESS HE ANSWERED WITH A SMILE
AND WHEN I HAD POINTED OUT THE INJURY THAT HAD BEEN DONE TO MY FINE COINS HE ANSWERED LIKE THE DONKEY THAT HE WAS
ON THE MORROW WHEN I ROSE THE SAME ATTENTIONS WERE PAID ME
AND WHEN I SAW THAT I COULD KILL HIM INSTEAD OF STRIKING I SAID
THEN I BEGAN MY SPEECH AS FOLLOWS
ALSO FOR YOUR JOURNEY HITHER HE GIVES YOU FIVE HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS WHICH WILL BE PAID YOU BEFORE YOU QUIT THIS PLACE. AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT I REPLIED THAT THOSE WERE OFFERS WORTHY OF THE GREAT KING HE WAS
YET HE IMMEDIATELY RESUMED HIS ART AND FASHIONED A MIRROR ABOUT A CUBIT IN DIAMETER OUT OF BONE AND IVORY WITH FIGURES AND FOLIAGE OF GREAT FINISH AND GRAND DESIGN
THEN SMILING IN MY TURN AND BOWING TO HER I TOOK MY LEAVE SAYING I WANTED NO REWARD BUT THAT
HE LAUGHED ME IN THE FACE AND SAID
THE POPE WAS ENTERTAINED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE FORGOT THE ANNOYANCE OF THE MARQUIS STANDING THERE
I BEING INNOCENT OF THE CRIME FALSELY ASCRIBED TO ME FELT NO FEAR WHATEVER
ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF HIS SECRETARIES APPEARED AND WHISPERED SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE IN HIS EAR
CONSEQUENTLY WHAT I TOLD YOUR EXCELLENCY ABOUT THIS LOVELY STATUE IS MERE SIMPLE TRUTH
I WILL NOT HERE OMIT TO RELATE SOMETHING WHICH MAY SERVE TO GIVE A NOTION OF THE SIZE OF THIS GREAT WORK AND IS AT THE SAME TIME HIGHLY COMIC
HE WAS OF VERY TENDER AGE AND THE MOST ADMIRABLE SERVANT IN THE WORLD
I HAVE BROUGHT IT FAR FORWARD WITH GREAT LABOUR AND DO NOT WANT IT TO GO INTO THE HANDS OF SOME IGNORANT BEAST WHO WILL DESTROY IT WITH NO TROUBLE. WHILE I SPOKE THUS THE GOLDSMITH TOBBIA WAS STANDING BY WHO EVEN PRESUMPTUOUSLY ASKED ME FOR THE MODELS ALSO OF MY WORK
THE GIRL FLUNG HERSELF UPON HER KNEES AND SHRIEKED TO HEAVEN FOR MERCY
THE CARDINAL DE GADDI WHO WAS PRESENT AT THIS CONVERSATION ADVANCED IMMEDIATELY AND TOLD HIS MAJESTY THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE DISPOSITIONS SEEING THAT HE HAD SENT YOU MONEY ENOUGH AND THAT YOU WERE ALREADY ON THE JOURNEY
HE IS QUITE CAPABLE OF GIVING YOU A PROPER ANSWER
IT FIGURED A FOUNTAIN SHAPED IN A PERFECT SQUARE WITH HANDSOME STEPS ALL ROUND INTERSECTING EACH OTHER IN A WAY WHICH WAS UNKNOWN IN FRANCE AND IS INDEED VERY UNCOMMON IN ITALY
FINDING MYSELF IN THIS CONDITION I WAS SEIZED WITH WONDER BECAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNISE THE STREET
I WILL NEVER PUT UP WITH SUCH INSULTS. SEEING THEN THAT THE AFFAIR WAS TAKING A BAD TURN I TOOK A SUDDEN RESOLUTION AND CRIED TO PAGOLO AND ASCANIO
I TALKED THEN TO THIS DONKEY AND DESCRIBED MY REQUIREMENTS FOR THERE WAS A GARDEN ADJOINING THE HOUSE ON WHICH I WANTED TO ERECT A WORKSHOP
MY LORD DO ME THE FAVOUR TO PURCHASE THIS NECKLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SET MY HEART ON THEM AND YOUR BENVENUTO HERE HAS SAID HE NEVER SAW A FINER ROW OF PEARLS. THE DUKE REPLIED
WELL IT IS HE WHO SUFFERS! AND I TOOK MY LEAVE
HOWEVER MY TWO YOUNG MEN KEPT SAYING TO ME
I THOUGHT THAT MY YOUNG MEN HAD BEEN KILLED AND WAS RESOLVED TO DIE WITH THEM
ON BECOMING AWARE OF THEIR EVIL WILL AGAINST ME I COMPLAINED TO CERTAIN WORTHY FELLOWS AND REMARKED THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE THIEVERIES THEY PRACTISED ON ME UNDER THE CLOAK OF HYPOCRITICAL KINDNESS
I ANSWERED THAT I THANKED GOD AND HIS MAJESTY FOR EVERYTHING
VINCENZIO ROMOLI WHO QUAKED LIKE AN ASPEN LEAF LOOKED AFTER THE PERFUMES
I WHO DESIRED NOTHING IN THE WORLD MORE PREPARED SOME SNOW-WHITE PLASTER IN A LITTLE BOX AND SET TO WORK AT ONCE
IF YOUR MAJESTY ENTERTAINS THE LEAST DOUBT UPON THIS POINT I WILL FLY TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF MY CONDUCT AT THE RISK EVEN OF MY LIFE
I MEAN IN THIS WAY
FOR IT WAS CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO BE LOOSED FROM PRISON
FOR HIS HOLINESS WAITED ABOVE TWO MONTHS BEFORE HE SENT TO ME AND DURING THAT WHILE NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED ME TO GO UNCALLED FOR TO THE PALACE
BUT WHEN I SAW THEIR HARE-BRAINED RECKLESSNESS I TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD THAT THOSE GERMAN WATERS WOULD NOT DROWN FOLK AS OURS DO IN ITALY
HIS BROTHER THE COUNT WAS GENERAL IN THE FRENCH ARMY
AS FOR THE BALANCE DUE UPON MY PERSEUS HE MIGHT GIVE THIS TO ME WHEN HE JUDGED IT OPPORTUNE
THIS PIECE I MADE IN THE WORKSHOP OF ONE FRANCESCO SALIMBENE
BUT COULD NOT
XVI IT CHANCED ONE DAY THAT I WAS LEANING AGAINST A SHOP OF ONE OF THESE MEN WHO CALLED OUT TO ME AND BEGAN PARTLY REPROACHING PARTLY BULLYING
NAY I WILL MURDER YOU ALL THREE
NOT EVEN AT NIGHT DID HE LOCK ME IN AS WAS THE CUSTOM WITH THE OTHER PRISONERS
IT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN THE EMPEROR WITH A HUGE ARMY WAS MARCHING UPON PARIS
THIS LED TO THE FORMATION OF A CLUB OF PAINTERS SCULPTORS AND GOLDSMITHS THE BEST THAT WERE IN ROME
THE NECROMANCER SAID THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO A SECOND TIME AND THAT I SHOULD OBTAIN THE FULL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF MY REQUEST
SHE HAD TO RETURN TO THE CHARGE MORE THAN TWICE BEFORE SHE SHOOK THE KINGS DETERMINATION
LAST NIGHT AND WITH A GIRL IN HER EARLIEST MATURITY. UPON THIS PERCEIVING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN FOOLISHLY HE MADE HASTE TO ADD
THE POPE VERY WELL PERCEIVED MY DRIFT
YOU MADMAN
UP THERE IS GIOVAN FRANCESCO DELLA TACCAS PIGEON AT WHICH HE HAS SO OFTEN FIRED
THAT WAS THE PALACE OF A GREAT NEAPOLITAN NOBLEMAN WHO HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH ME IN MY ART AND HAD BESIDES TAKEN A FANCY TO ME BECAUSE OF MY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL APTITUDE FOR FIGHTING TO WHICH MY LORD HIMSELF WAS PERSONALLY WELL INCLINED
IT IS THEREFORE TO THIS MOSCHINO PROBABLY THAT CELLINI REFERS ABOVE
HE HAS NOT DISPLAYED MUCH LITERARY SKILL IN THE REDACTION AND I HAVE BEEN AT PAINS TO PRESERVE THE ROUGHNESS OF THE ORIGINAL
THOSE MEN OF FLORENCE HAVE SET A YOUNG MAN UPON A METTLESOME HORSE
HE BADE HIM ORDER ALL US BOMBARDIERS TO POINT OUR PIECES WHICH WERE VERY NUMEROUS IN ONE MASS UPON THE HOUSE AND TO DISCHARGE THEM ALL TOGETHER UPON THE SIGNAL OF AN ARQUEBUSE BEING FIRED
SURGETTO THAT WAS WHAT THEY CALLED HIM WHEN HE LIVED WITH THEM WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO BECOME SO HANDSOME? ASCANIO ANSWERED
THEN I EXHIBITED THE SAFE-CONDUCT SENT ME AT THE ORDER OF THE POPE AND TOLD HIM HOW HIS HOLINESS HAD RECALLED ME TO EXECUTE CERTAIN PIECES OF WORK
I AM KEEPING MILIANOS FOIL AND I WILL SEE WHETHER I CAN IMPROVE ON IT WITH SOME OF MY OWN MANUFACTURE
THEN FOLLOWED CONVERSATION AND WITTY SAYINGS ON WHICH I WILL NOT ENLARGE FOR THAT IS NOT MY BUSINESS
SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THIS DATE BANDINELLO DIED
AS I WAS PASSING HE BOWED TO ME AND HIS MASTER ALMOST LAUGHED ME IN THE FACE
KEEN AS WAS BENVENUTOS INTEREST IN HIMSELF AND MUCH AS HE LOVED TO DWELL ON THE SPLENDOR OF HIS EXPLOITS AND ACHIEVEMENTS HE HAD LITTLE IDEA THAT CENTURIES AFTER HIS DEATH HE WOULD LIVE AGAIN LESS BY HIS PERSEUS AND HIS GOLDSMITHS WORK THAN BY THE BOOK WHICH HE DICTATED CASUALLY TO A LAD OF FOURTEEN WHILE HE WENT ABOUT HIS WORK
FOR THUS I HAD RECEIVED COMMISSION
O TRAITOR OF A CHILD YOUVE RUINED ME
NICCOLò GADDI WAS CREATED CARDINAL ON THE SAME DAY AS ACCOLTI
IF THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT. GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MAESTRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED
BUT WHEN THEY SAW ME PREPARED IN THAT WAY TO RECEIVE THEM THEY FELL BACK EXCLAIMING
CAPITOLO IS THE TECHNICAL NAME FOR A COPY OF VERSES IN TERZA RIMA ON A CHOSEN THEME
JEAN GROLIER THE FAMOUS FRENCH MæCENAS COLLECTOR OF BOOKS ANTIQUITIES C
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENVENUTO CELLINI I ALL MEN OF WHATSOEVER QUALITY THEY BE WHO HAVE DONE ANYTHING OF EXCELLENCE OR WHICH MAY PROPERLY RESEMBLE EXCELLENCE OUGHT IF THEY ARE PERSONS OF TRUTH AND HONESTY TO DESCRIBE THEIR LIFE WITH THEIR OWN HAND
LIV ON THAT VERY DAY AS I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND HAD MY FINE RETRIEVER WITH ME JUST WHEN WE CAME OPPOSITE THE GATE OF THE BARGELLO MY DOG FLEW BARKING LOUDLY INSIDE THE DOOR UPON A YOUTH WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE SUIT OF A MAN CALLED DONNINO A GOLDSMITH FROM PARMA AND A FORMER PUPIL OF CARADOSSO ON THE CHARGE OF HAVING ROBBED HIM
WHAT IS THAT GREAT THING ONE SEES THERE OVER FLORENCE? IT RESEMBLED A HUGE BEAM OF FIRE WHICH SPARKLED AND GAVE OUT EXTRAORDINARY LUSTRE
FRIEND BENVENUTO IF YOU FEEL INCLINED TO EXECUTE SOMETHING FOR ME TOO I AM READY TO PAY YOU FAR BETTER THAN THAT KING OF YOURS HAD DONE FOR WHOM YOUR EXCELLENT NATURE PROMPTS YOU TO SPEAK SO GRATEFULLY. WHEN I UNDERSTOOD HIS DRIFT I DESCRIBED THE DEEP OBLIGATIONS UNDER WHICH I LAY TO HIS MAJESTY WHO FIRST OBTAINED MY LIBERATION FROM THAT INIQUITOUS PRISON AND AFTERWARDS SUPPLIED ME WITH THE MEANS OF CARRYING OUT MORE ADMIRABLE WORKS THAN ANY ARTIST OF MY QUALITY HAD EVER HAD THE CHANCE TO DO
MY ART SHOULD REAR A MONUMENT OF HEAVENS HIGH EQUIPAGE
HER MOTHER PERCEIVING US IN THIS CLOSE CONVERSATION DREW NIGH AND SAID
THIS HE OBTAINED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
THE SOUND BLOWS UPON HIS CHEEKS NOT ONLY REDDENED THEM ABOVE THEIR NATURAL PURPLE BUT ALSO BROUGHT TEARS INTO HIS EYES
THEN AS THE CUSTOM IN FRANCE IS THEY ASKED TO DRINK IN HIGH GOOD SPIRITS
GIOVIO IN HIS LIFE OF CARDINAL POMPEO COLONNA QUITE GRAVELY RELATES HOW IT WAS THE HIGHEST AMBITION OF YOUNG ROMANS OF SPIRIT TO MURDER THE BARGELLO
SO WE ABODE THUS UNTIL THE MATINBELLS BEGAN TO SOUND
AGAIN THE EVIL THINGS SAID BY ROSSO AGAINST SAN GALLO 1 THAT EXCELLENT ARCHITECT CAUSED THE LATTER TO GET WORK TAKEN FROM HIM WHICH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROCURED FOR HIM FROM MESSER AGNOLO DA CESI
WE SHALL HEAR MORE OF HIM IN CELLINIS PAGES
OH WHAT COULD I NOT HAVE DONE IF HIS EXCELLENCY HAD BUT SET ME TO WORK
REFLECT UPON THE WAY YOU MEAN TO TAKE WHETHER THAT FOR GOOD WHICH I FORMERLY DESCRIBED OR THIS LATTER BAD ONE I HAVE JUST NOW SET BEFORE YOU. THE MAN DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR DO AND I WAS INCLINED TO CUT THE MATTER SHORT UPON THE SPOT RATHER THAN TO POSTPONE ACTION
BENEATH HIM I GROUPED THE FOUR SEA-HORSES AND IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HELD HIS TRIDENT
YET IT PROVED THE SOURCE OF INFINITE ANNOYANCE AND HURT TO ME
APRIL 27 1554
THEY WANTED TO PURSUE THE RUFFIANS WHO COULD STILL BE SEEN
THEY TOO HAD ENDURED SORE TRIBULATION FOR MY SAKE AND TO THEIR FERVENT PRAYERS I FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT I OWED THE GRACE OF MY DELIVERANCE BY GOD
III WHEN THE TIME CAME TO TRAVEL HE GAVE ME A FINE AND EXCELLENT HORSE
INDEED I HAD MET WITH NOTHING TO MY LIKING THERE EXCEPT THOSE PEACOCKS WHICH RESTORED MY HEALTH
YOU MUST EITHER PRODUCE THE CHALICE ON THE INSTANT OR LOOK TO YOUR AFFAIRS. THEN I REPLIED THAT INASMUCH AS I HAD NEVER TO THAT HOUR BELIEVED A HOLY VICAR OF CHRIST COULD COMMIT AN UNJUST ACT SO I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BEFORE I DID BELIEVE IT
THEREFORE I HOLD MYSELF OVERPAID ALREADY AND RETURN THANKS TO YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY WITH ALL MY HEART. THE DUKE MADE ANSWER
PUR BEATO CHE IO L HO VEDUTO LECLANCHé TRANSLATES THUS
I MEANWHILE WAS NOT WANTING IN DESPATCH FOR I SENT WORD TO SEVERAL OF MY JOURNEYMEN THAT THEY SHOULD COME AND ATTEND ME SINCE THE MATTER WAS ONE OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE
HE SHOULD LIKE ME TO KEEP MYSELF IN HEALTH IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY MY SERVICES THROUGH MANY YEARS TO COME
PROBABLY GIROLAMO LUCCHESINI
THEN HE KISSED ME ON THE FOREHEAD AND BOTH EYES AND GAVE ME HIS HEARTY BLESSING SAYING
YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE MANY OF US HERE AND OUR ENTRANCE HAS MADE A TUMULT IN THIS PLACE YET YOU DO NOT TURN ROUND. WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS I WAS WELL ABLE TO CONCEIVE WHAT GREATER HARM MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME BUT BEING USED AND HARDENED TO MISFORTUNE I SAID TO THEM
THEREFORE MONSIGNORI DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO
TWENTY YEARS AGO I HAD THAT FINE BLOCK QUARRIED ESPECIALLY FOR BANDINELLO AND SO I MEAN THAT BANDINELLO SHALL HAVE IT TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH IT. I TURNED TO THE DUKE AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
IN ANSWER TO WHICH HIS HOLINESS SENT WORD-AS ONE WHO HAD NO FAITH EITHER IN GOD OR AUGHT BESIDE-THAT I WAS MAD AND THAT HE MUST DO HIS BEST TO MEND HIS HEALTH
ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BENVENUTO THIS TIME YOU ARE AN ILL-COMER. I UNDERSTOOD HIS SPEECH AND CALLED OUT THE SECOND TIME
2 WHEN I REACHED PONTE SISTO I FOUND THE WHOLE OF THE BARGELLOS GUARD THERE BOTH HORSE AND FOOT
ON WHICH I SAID THAT IF I KNEW HOW TO USE MY TOOLS IN HANDICRAFT AS WELL AS HE HAD SEEN I COULD BE QUITE AS CLEVER WITH MY SWORD IN CLAIMING THE JUST PAYMENT OF MY LABOUR
I THEN DETERMINED TO CONFIDE IN THE YOUNG GREEK AND SAID TO HIM
AND I SHALL BE PLEASED IF WE CAN SEE OUR WAY TOWARD DOING SOMETHING TO ASSIST HIM. THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE POPE SENT FOR ME AFTER DINNERTIME AND I FOUND THAT GREAT NOBLE IN THE PRESENCE
1 SEEING THE REALM OF FRANCE TO BE IN GREAT NEED OF MONEY THE CARDINAL ONE DAY BEGAN TO TALK OF ME AND SAID
THESE WORDS DID NOT MAKE ME SWERVE FROM MY PURPOSE
HAVE YE SUCH HATE OF LIFE
HIS MASTER WAS THEN LODGING IN THE PALACE
THE NAME OF LEONE LEONI IS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A GOLDSMITH AND BRONZE-CASTER
ANOTHER WAS THAT THE TURKISH ARABESQUES ARE ONLY COMPOSED OF ARUM LEAVES A FEW SMALL SUNFLOWERS
NOW AND THEN JUST TO IRRITATE ME THEY WOULD TOUCH IT LIGHTLY UPON WHICH I CRIED
HOWEVER IF THOSE CRIMES ARE TOO EXORBITANT YOUR HOLINESS IS WISE AND HOLY AND MAY YOUR WILL BE DONE UNQUESTIONED
IT WAS SO ORDAINED BY GOD THAT WHILE WE WERE AT DINNER THESE FELLOWS ON THE NEWS THAT I WAS NOT TRAVELLING IN THE CARDINALS SUITE MADE PREPARATION TO ATTACK ME
IT SEEMED CERTAIN THAT HE MUST GO TO PERDITION
BUT YOU MISCREANTS SHALL BE MISCREANTS STILL ACCURSED AND IN THE WRATH OF GOD
6 I TOLD HIM THAT IN A FEW DAYS I WOULD PROVE TO HIS HOLINESS THAT HIS SERVICE HAD NEVER BEEN NEGLECTED BY ME
A MIRACLE
ALLUSION TO THE PROPHETIC WORDS HE FLUNG AT THE OFFICERS WHO TOOK HIM TO FOIANOS DUNGEON
HERE I DO NOT FIND MY TRUE FOE MESSER DURANTE BUT A PIECE OF BAD SOFT STONE WHICH CANNOT DO ME ANY HARM WHATEVER! PREVIOUSLY I HAD BEEN RESOLVED TO REMAIN QUIET AND TO DIE IN PEACE
FOR THE MORE THERE ARE OF THESE THE BETTER WILL THE MOULD FILL
I DID SO WILLINGLY ENOUGH
ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE JEWELS AND THE GOLD WERE GIVEN ME I BEGAN THE WORK AND DRIVING IT BRISKLY FORWARD IN A FEW DAYS BROUGHT IT TO SUCH BEAUTY THAT THE POPE WAS ASTONISHED AND SHOWED ME THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SIGNS OF FAVOUR CONCEDING AT THE SAME TIME THAT THAT BEAST JUVENALE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH ME
LAMENTONE CRIED FOR GODS SAKE HOLD! SOME OF THEM EXCLAIMED OH ME MY HEAD! OTHERS LET ME GET OUT FROM HERE. IN SHORT IT WAS AN INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION
I NAMED THE INFANT COSTANZA
MOREOVER HIS MAJESTY HAD ALLOWED A SIMILAR LICENSE TO BOLOGNA THE PAINTER WHEREFORE I HUMBLY BEGGED HIM TO CONCEDE THE SAME TO ME
WERE I BUT A WEALTHY EMPEROR I WOULD GIVE MY BENVENUTO AS MUCH LAND AS HIS EYES COULD SURVEY
YOUR GOOD APPEARANCE MAKES ME BELIEVE YOU ARE A DECENT HONEST YOUTH. THEN HE TOLD ME OUT GOLD SILVER AND GEMS
THOUGH THE DIVINE MICHEL AGNOLO IN LATER LIFE FINISHED THAT GREAT CHAPEL OF POPE JULIUS 3 HE NEVER ROSE HALF-WAY TO THE SAME PITCH OF POWER
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ME WHO KILLED THAT BRAVE YOUNG MAN THE LEAST TRIFLE OF DELAY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN HIS PUTTING US ALL TO FLIGHT WITH GREAT DISASTER. WHEN I SAW THAT THE FEVER CAUSED BY ALWAYS SEEING HIM ABOUT WAS DEPRIVING ME OF SLEEP AND APPETITE AND WAS BRINGING ME BY DEGREES TO SORRY PLIGHT I OVERCAME MY REPUGNANCE TO SO LOW AND NOT QUITE PRAISEWORTHY AN ENTERPRISE AND MADE MY MIND UP ONE EVENING TO RID MYSELF OF THE TORMENT
HE AND HIS SON PIERRE AFTER HIM HELD THE OFFICE OF TRéSORIER DE LEPARGNE SEE PLON P
CON LARGENTO E OGNI COSAL THESE WORDS REFER PERHAPS TO THE VASES
NO SOONER HAD I SHOWN MY FACE THAN HE CALLED OUT
FOR I OUGHT TO SAY THAT A JEWELLER WHEN HE HAS TO WORK WITH FIGURES MUST OF NECESSITY UNDERSTAND DESIGN ELSE HE CANNOT PRODUCE ANYTHING WORTH LOOKING AT
AFTER TELLING THE YOUNG MEN TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH FRESH CLOTHES I TOOK MY PIECE TOGETHER WITH THE GEMS SETTING THEM AS WELL AS I COULD IN THEIR PROPER PLACES AND WENT OFF AT ONCE WITH THEM TO THE POPE
IT IS TRUE THAT FAR MORE OF THE FOOT THAN I EXPECTED HAD BEEN PERFECTLY FORMED
WHILE I WAS AT WORK UPON THE JUPITER I NOTICED THAT I HAD PLENTY OF SILVER TO SPARE
THEREFORE LET ME CONTINUE MY DEFENCE IF YOU WISH TO REPORT THE CASE TO THE POPE AND TO JUDGE ME FAIRLY
I THOUGHT IT CERTAIN THAT A FEW MORE DAYS WOULD PUT AN END OF MY UNLUCKY LIFE IN THAT SAD PLACE AND IN THAT MISERABLE MANNER
AND THE MEDICI WHEN THEY REGAINED THEIR PRINCIPALITY ERECTED THIS MONUMENT TO HIS MEMORY EMPLOYING ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO FRANCESCO DA SAN GALLO AND A NEAPOLITAN MATTEO DE QUARANTA
IN THIS DOCUMENT I DESCRIBED IN DETAIL ALL THE WORKS WHICH I HAD EXECUTED AND ALL THE ADVENTURES I HAD GONE THROUGH WHILE PERFORMING THEM AND ALL THE SUMS WHICH HAD BEEN SPENT UPON THEM
THE OTHERS WERE VERY MODEST AND ABLE CRAFTSMEN
YET IT WAS WITH GREAT AND HEAVY RELUCTANCE THAT I LOOKED FORWARD TO SUCH A DEPARTURE
WE HAVE LOST THE BEST DEFENDER THAT WE HAD. ATTRACTED BY THE UPROAR ONE OF MY COMRADES RAN UP
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THAT I WILL BRING YOUR PRIDE DOWN LOWER THAN A SPANIEL BY THE WORDS OF REASON YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME
SO COME FRIEND MESSER BENEDETTO AND DESPATCH MY BUSINESS BEFORE I LOSE CONTROL OVER MY BETTER INSTINCTS. AFTER I HAD UTTERED THESE WORDS THE WORTHY MAN TOLD THE GUARD TO LOCK THE DOOR BECAUSE NOTHING COULD BE DONE WITHOUT HIS PRESENCE
BUT IF I RECEIVED NO LETTERS THAT WOULD BE A SIGN THAT I MIGHT SET OFF WITH AN EASY MIND
WE SHALL SEE HOW HE TREATED CELLINI DURING A FEVER
THIS MAN DID WHAT WAS EQUIVALENT TO BEGGING MY PARDON IN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE VERY PERSONS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK REVENGE ON HIM FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS WHOM HE HAD MASSACRED
IN REPLY TO THESE GRACIOUS SPEECHES I SAID THAT IF THEIR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCIES WOULD PROVIDE ME WITH THE NECESSARY ACCOMMODATIONS I SHOULD GLADLY FOR THEIR SAKES PUT MY HAND TO SUCH AN ARDUOUS UNDERTAKING
FOR I WAS LOSING A GRAND MODEL WHO BROUGHT ME HONOUR THROUGH MY ART
1 AND WHILE I WAS RECOVERING MY BREATH AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUME THE HABIT OF MY ART I HAD GREAT PLEASURE IN RE-WRITING THE CAPITOLO
PULITEZZA THIS INDICATES PRECISION NEATNESS CLEANNESS OF EXECUTION
LIKEWISE IF A NOBLEMAN GAVE COMMISSION FOR A JEWEL OF A THOUSAND CROWNS VALUE TO BE SET WHEN HE SAW THAT THE JEWELLER WAS NOT SERVING HIM ACCORDING TO HIS DESIRE HE COULD SAY:GIVE ME BACK MY STONE FOR I DO NOT WANT YOUR WORK. BUT IN A CASE OF THIS KIND NONE OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS APPLY
TELL HIM FROM ME THAT HE HAS DELIGHTED ME FAR MORE THAN I EXPECTED
THIS ETEXT WAS PRODUCED BY NORMAN WOLCOTT
SO HE SAID
THE DISTILLER CAME ACCOMPANIED BY TREASURER GROLIER A VERY GREAT NOBLEMAN OF FRANCE WHO SPOKE ITALIAN EXCELLENTLY AND WHEN HE ENTERED MY CASTLE BEGAN TO JEST WITH ME IN THAT LANGUAGE
I MUST SAY THAT HE HAD MADE US BRING PRECIOUS PERFUMES AND FIRE AND ALSO DRUGS OF FETID ODOUR
LET THE MAN STRAIN HIMSELF TO THE UTMOST IN PROOF OF GRATITUDE TO FORTUNE FOR SO GREAT A FAVOUR SO UNDESERVEDLY CONFERRED ON HIM BY HER
THE TWO SLANG PHRASES TRANSLATED ABOVE ARE BORDELLERIE AND COGLIONERIE XXII NEXT DAY I WENT TO THANK MADONNA PORZIA AND TOLD HER THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD DONE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE SAID SHE WOULD
YOU GIVE ME MUCH CAUSE FOR WONDER SEEKING AS YOU DO TO MAKE ME QUIT THE SERVICE OF A PRINCE WHO IS THE GREATEST PATRON OF THE ARTS THAT EVER LIVED
BENVENUTO SET THE FOX TO WATCH THE GRAPES 1 AND THOUGHT I WOULD NOT EAT THEM
SINCE I HAD EXPRESSED MY INTENTION OF FOLLOWING THE CARDINAL I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY OF MY ENEMIES WOULD BE UPON THE WATCH TO HARM ME
HE NEXT PLACED IN MY HAND THE PENTACLE WHICH HE BID ME TURN TOWARD THE POINTS HE INDICATED AND UNDER THE PENTACLE I HELD THE LITTLE BOY MY WORKMAN
THAT IS IL FATTORE
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THE COUNSELLORS OF THAT SESSION WERE MEN OF WEIGHT AND WORTH
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE AND WOULD TO GOD THAT IT MAY FALL ON YOU! AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER

MAY THE POWER OF GOODNESS OF GOD BE YOUR PROTECTION; AND REACHING ME THE SWORD AND ARMOUR HE HELPED ME WITH HIS OWN HANDS TO PUT THEM ON
YOUR HOUSE IS TOO FAR OFF FROM HIS IF HE MUST CALL AGAIN. POOR TRIBOLO ALL IN DISMAY EXCLAIMED
THOU THAT BY THY IMMEASURABLE POWER DIDST RISE FROM THE DEAD AND IN THY GLORY DIDST ASCEND TO HEAVEN!&HELLIP EVEN THUS IN A MOMENT MY MOULD WAS FILLED
IT WAS AS LARGE AS A BIG HAZEL-NUT WITH THE HEAD OF MINERVA IN A STYLE OF INCONCEIVABLE BEAUTY
TO THIS THE POPE REPLIED THAT HE APPROVED OF THE SUGGESTION BUT THAT I SHOULD ADD ON THE PART OF HIS HOLINESS WHEN I PRESENTED THE BOOK TO THE EMPEROR THAT I MADE HIM THE PRESENT OF MYSELF
1 I ANSWERED THAT IT SEEMED TO ME MOST APPROPRIATE TO PRESENT HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY WITH A GOLDEN CRUCIFIX FOR WHICH I HAD ALMOST FINISHED AN ORNAMENT QUITE TO THE PURPOSE AND WHICH WOULD CONFER THE HIGHEST HONOUR UPON HIS HOLINESS AND ME
ON THE SPOT HE FLEW OFF CRYING FOR A STOOP OF THE VERY BEST GREEK WINE
THE BEASTS IN THE FIELD LAY DEAD
YET WISHING NOT TO ADD TO MY UNEASINESS AND TO THE HARM I HAD ALREADY TAKEN I MADE SHOW OF BEING IN GOOD SPIRITS
BUT I WHO CHAFED AGAINST THE LEASH 4 WHEN I KNEW THAT THEY WERE COMING ROUND TO BID ME STOP FROM FIRING LET BLAZE ONE OF MY DEMI-CANNONS AND STRUCK A PILLAR IN THE COURTYARD OF THE HOUSE AROUND WHICH I SAW A CROWD OF PEOPLE CLUSTERING
THE CAPTAIN CATTIVANZA DEGLI STROZZI CHANCED TO BE IN THE SAME SHOP
ON ONE OF THOSE DAYS MY FATHER CAME TO PIEROS HOUSE TO HEAR US PLAY AND IN ECSTASY AT MY PERFORMANCE EXCLAIMED
IT REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME IN THE HANDS OF THE CISTERCIANS
WITH PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT I DWELT UPON THE FORCE OF GODS SPIRIT IN THOSE MEN OF GREAT SIMPLICITY WHO BELIEVED SO FERVENTLY THAT HE WOULD BRING ALL THEIR HEARTS DESIRE TO PASS
THE WHOLE PIECE REPOSED UPON A BASE OF EBONY PROPERLY PROPORTIONED BUT WITH A PROJECTING CORNICE UPON WHICH I INTRODUCED FOUR GOLDEN FIGURES IN RATHER MORE THAN HALF-RELIEF
ANTONIO PUCCI A FLORENTINE CARDINAL DE QUATTRO SANTI CORONATI
THE BUILDING ALSO CONTAINED SOME LITTLE DWELLINGS INHABITED BY DIFFERENT SORTS OF MEN AMONG WHOM WAS A PRINTER OF BOOKS OF MUCH EXCELLENCE IN HIS OWN TRADE
UPON THE WAY TO THE POPE I TURNED OVER IN MY MIND WHAT I SHOULD PUT FORWARD TO EXCUSE MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE HIS WORK
SFORZA SFORZA SON OF BOSIO COUNT OF SANTA FIORE AND OF COSTANZA FARNESE THE POPES NATURAL DAUGHTER
HIS REAL NAME WAS AMBROGIO FOPPA
I ONLY LOST MY CAP ON WHICH MY ADVERSARIES SEIZED THOUGH THEY HAD RUN AWAY FROM IT BEFORE AND STRUCK AT IT WITH ALL THEIR WEAPONS
LXXVIII AFTER I HAD LET MY STATUE COOL FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS I BEGAN TO UNCOVER IT BY SLOW DEGREES
I REMEMBERED THAT MESSER LODOVICO DA FANO MESSER ANTONIO ALLEGRETTI MESSER GIOVANNI GRECO ALL OF THEM MEN OF THE FINEST SCHOLARSHIP AND MESSER ANNIBAL CARO WHO WAS THEN QUITE YOUNG WERE PRESENT
THE EARTH I FASHIONED LIKE A WOMAN WITH ALL THE BEAUTY OF FORM THE GRACE AND CHARM OF WHICH MY ART WAS CAPABLE
THEN CARRY HIM TO THE PLACE YOU WOT OF. IT WAS AS I HAVE SAID THE NIGHT AFTER CORPUS DOMINI AND ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK
THEREUPON WITHOUT REGARDING THE COPIOUS DINNER WHICH SANSOVINO HAD GIVEN ME I TOOK THE PART OF MY COMRADE TRIBOLO FOR HE WAS IN THE RIGHT
I SHOULD NEVER HENCEFORTH HAVE ANY QUARRELS WITH HIM BECAUSE HE KNEW MY CHARACTER
FOR SHE WAS BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND BROUGHT ME MUCH CREDIT AS A MODEL
HE WAS A MAN OF MUCH LEARNING WHO USED TO DISCOURSE WONDERFULLY ABOUT MEDICINE
HE REPORTED THIS TO THE CARDINAL WHO SWORE AT HIM AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE ME TAKE THE MONEY BY FORCE AND NOT TO SHOW HIMSELF AGAIN TILL HE HAD DONE SO
BUT I STOPPED THEM CALLING BACK SO AS TO LET THE VILLAINS HEAR
YET WOULD I LIKE ONE LAW PASSED-THAT THE MAN WHOSE ACTS DESERVE IT SHOULD NOT SCAPE THIS SCORE
THE POOR FELLOW IS DELIRIOUS AND HAS ONLY A FEW HOURS TO LIVE. HIS FELLOW MATTIO FRANZESI REMARKED
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE DUCHESS SENT FOR BERNARDONE THE BROKER OF WHOM SHE HAD SO OFTEN COMPLAINED TO ME ABUSING HIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGNESS AND UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
ALL ROUND HIM ON EACH SIDE STOOD A CROWD OF SOLICITORS AND ADVOCATES RANGED UPON THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT
SO JUST WHEN WE MET HIS LORDSHIP ASCANIO SAID
THE ONLY THING WHICH KEPT ME BACK WAS THAT HE HAD PROCURED MY FREEDOM FROM POPE PAOLO
AND WHEN HIS MESSENGER DID NOT FIND ME AT HOME HE BROKE INTO FURY SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE WORK OUT OF MY HANDS AND GIVE IT TO OTHERS TO FINISH
THE DUKE SAYS HE WANTS YOU TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH YOU ASK FOR YOUR PERSEUS. I REMAINED DUMBFOUNDED AND ASTONISHED
AND BEING ONE DAY IN A GROUND-FLOOR ROOM ABOVE THE VAULT WHICH HE WAS MAKING TOGETHER WITH MUCH COMPANY AROUND HIM HE FELL TO TALKING ABOUT HIS OLD MASTER MY FATHER
SCUDI DI GIULI AND SCUDI DI MONETA THE GIULIO WAS A SILVER COIN WORTH 56 ITALIAN CENTIMES
TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MADE BISHOP OF JESI

THEY WOULD BECOME A PLACE FOR DOGS TO PISS AT AND BE ALWAYS FULL OF ORDURE
HE HAS HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT POPE CLEMENT INDEED WAS THE HANDSOMEST SOVEREIGN THAT EVER REIGNED AND NO LESS GIFTED
BUT SHE TORE THE PIECE IN HALF AND IN THE GENTLEST MANNER WRAPT MY HAND UP WITH HER FINGERS
I THEREFORE KEPT URGING THE CARDINAL TO PUT THE KING IN MIND OF EMPLOYING ME IN SOME LOCALITY WHERE I COULD STOP AND WORK
I MUST TELL YOU THAT MASTER BINDO ALTOVITI TOOK ME TO SEE HIS BUST IN BRONZE AND INFORMED ME THAT YOU HAD MADE IT
FOR IF YOUR EXCELLENCY UNDERSTOOD MY TRADE AS WELL AS YOU IMAGINE YOU WOULD TRUST ME ON THE PROOFS I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN
THEN WHEN THOSE GENTLEMEN THE CHAMBERLAINS KEPT URGING ME TO DO QUICKLY WHAT I MEANT TO DO I TOLD THEM I WAS READY
ASCANIO REPLIED WITH THE TEARS OF A THIEF AND HYPOCRITE
THE CURIOUS DISCOVERING THEM IN SUCH PLACES SINCE THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND HAS GRADUALLY BEEN RAISED WHILE THEY HAVE REMAINED BELOW AND SINCE IN ROME THESE VAULTED ROOMS ARE COMMONLY CALLED GROTTOES IT HAS FOLLOWED THAT THE WORD GROTESQUE IS APPLIED TO THE PATTERNS I HAVE MENTIONED
HE NEVER RETURNED BUT DIED IN THE RIVER GARIGLIANO IN 1504
THEY HAVE ANOTHER UGLY CUSTOM WHICH IS THAT THE NORMANS NEARLY ALL OF THEM TRAFFIC IN FALSE EVIDENCE
BUT MADAME DETAMPES USED THOSE WILES WITH WHICH WOMEN KNOW SO WELL TO WORK ON MEN AND VERY EASILY SUCCEEDED IN HER ENTERPRISE
PAUL III ELECTED OCTOBER 13 1534
THE ENTRY INTO ROME TOOK PLACE APRIL 6 1536
THE MARVELLOUS APPARITION REMAINED BEFORE ME LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
THINKING THAT I SPOKE THUS ONLY TO BRAG AND NOT BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRUTH HE MADE THE CARDINAL OF LORRAINE REPEAT WHAT HE HAD SAID
FOR WHY SHOULD HE NEVER BECOME ANYTHING MORE THAN A GOOD MUSICIAN? THUS SOME TIME PASSED UNTIL THE MEDICI RETURNED
AND MY BROTHER FELT THE MOST UNBOUNDED LOVE FOR HIM
EIGHT DAYS LATER THE POPE SENT THE SAME MAN TO TELL ME THAT HE DID NOT MEAN ME TO FINISH THE CHALICE AND WANTED TO HAVE IT BACK PRECISELY AT THE POINT TO WHICH I HAD ALREADY BROUGHT IT
IT WAS NOT LIKE WHAT ONE COMMONLY OBSERVES BUT COVERED MY FLESH WITH CERTAIN BLISTERS OF THE SIZE OF SIX-PENCES AND ROSE-COLOURED
YES LIKE A PRINCE NOT LIKE AN ARTIST
ESPECIALLY AS I AM SURE MY SOUL IS SAVED AND THAT I AM GOING TO AN UNDESERVED DEATH
TO THE STAKE WITH HER AND HER MOTHER! I ALSO THREATENED THE JUDGE THAT IF HE DID NOT SEND HER TO PRISON THERE BEFORE ME I WOULD GO TO THE KING AT ONCE AND TELL HIM HOW HIS LIEUTENANT IN CRIMINAL AFFAIRS OF JUSTICE HAD WRONGED ME
HIS EXCELLENCY COMMITTED THE EXECUTION OF THESE ORDERS TO HIS MAJORDOMO WHO WAS NAMED SER PIER FRANCESCO RICCIO
HE POOR MAN COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SLEEP
I MUST NOT OMIT THE EXQUISITE ART OF ENAMELLING IN WHICH I HAVE NEVER KNOWN ANY ONE EXCEL SAVE A FLORENTINE OUR COUNTRYMAN CALLED AMERIGO
WITH BENVENUTO I WILL GO
CONSEQUENTLY I WOULD NOT SELL IT FOR TWO THOUSAND
I THEN BEGAN TO SAY MY SAY
I IT WAS WHO SHOT AT ISCATINARO WHEN I SAW HIM TALKING TO POPE CLEMENT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF REVERENCE NAY WITH THE MOST REVOLTING INSOLENCE LIKE THE LUTHERAN AND INFIDEL HE WAS
GIROLAMO BALBO OF THE NOBLE VENETIAN FAMILY BISHOP OF GURCK IN CARINTHIA
BUT SINCE THAT WAS NOT IN HER HANDS TO BESTOW SHE ADDED LAUGHING THAT I MUST BEG WHAT LAY WITHIN HER POWER
MARGARET OF AUSTRIA WHO MARRIED OTTAVIO FARNESE IN NOVEMBER 1538 AFTER ALESSANDROS MURDER
CARDINAL CORNARO WHEN HE HEARD OF MY IMPROVEMENT HAD ME TRANSPORTED TO A PLACE OF HIS ON MONTE CAVALLO
HE CAME FROM FLORENCE FOR THE INHERITANCE
INDEED THEY LABOURED MAINLY ON DESIGNS WHICH I HAD GIVEN THEM
AFTERWARDS HE AVOWED THAT HE HAD READ IT AND ADDED
THE VILLAGE WE WERE IN LAY ON THE FRONTIER BETWEEN VENICE AND THE GERMANS
INDEED IT IS A FAR GREATER HONOUR THAN TO BE MADE A NOBLEMAN OF VENICE. WHEN HE LEFT ME HE RETURNED AND TOLD HIS MAJESTY WHO LAUGHED AWHILE AND THEN SAID
WHILE CENCIO WAS ON THIS ERRAND I LIGHTED ANOTHER LAMP FOR I ALWAYS KEEP ONE BY ME AT NIGHT
TAKE THESE VASES BACK TO PARIS FOR I WANT TO HAVE THEM GILT. WITHOUT MAKING ANY OTHER ANSWER HE THEN DEPARTED
I AM DROWNING; AND AT OTHER TIMES HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN HELL AND TORTURED WITH THAT CAVIARE SUSPENDED ROUND HIS THROAT
I MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THE ONE YEAR THAT I STAYED THERE AND COMPLETED SEVERAL FINE AND VALUABLE THINGS IN GOLD AND SILVER WHICH INSPIRED ME WITH A RESOLUTE AMBITION TO ADVANCE IN MY ART
HE DEVOTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE CARE OF HIS SOUL AND HIS CONSCIENCE SEEMED TO SMITE HIM BECAUSE HE FELT THAT I HAD SUFFERED AND WAS SUFFERING A GRIEVOUS WRONG
ACCORDINGLY
XXII WHEN THE KING HAD SEEN THIS MODEL IT RESTORED HIM TO CHEERFULNESS AND DISTRACTED HIS MIND FROM THE FATIGUING DEBATES HE HAD BEEN HOLDING DURING THE PAST TWO HOURS
THEREFORE MY BENVENUTO BEFORE YOU PUT THE VERY LAST TOUCHES ON I SHOULD LIKE YOU FOR MY SAKE TO REMOVE A PART OF THE SCAFFOLDING ON THE SIDE OF THE PIAZZA SOME DAY TOWARD NOON IN ORDER THAT WE MAY LEARN WHAT FOLK THINK OF IT
WHEREUPON I BEING CONVINCED OF MY INNOCENCE RETORTED HOTLY THAT I HAD NEVER BROKEN FAITH AND WOULD MAINTAIN THESE WORDS AT THE PERIL OF MY LIFE AND THAT IF HE OR ANY OF HIS FELLOWS ABUSED ME SO UNJUSTLY I WOULD FLING THE LIE BACK IN HIS THROAT
AND HE TOOK CARE THAT A SECRET WATCH SHOULD BE KEPT OVER MY PROCEEDINGS FOR HE HAD VAST AUTHORITY IN PADUA
WHEREUPON I SAID THAT HE WAS NOT SPEAKING THE TRUTH
THEY MARVELLED MUCH THE WHILE TO FIND SUCH VALOUR IN SO YOUNG A BOY
IT HAPPENED ONE DAY ABOUT NOON THAT A CROWD OF TALL MEN AND LUSTY YOUNG FELLOWS THE FIRST IN THE CITY WERE ASSEMBLED IN MY WORKSHOP WHEN A LETTER FROM ROME WAS PUT INTO MY HANDS
HAD YOU WRITTEN TO TELL ME OF THREE HUNDRED CROWNS AS YOU HAVE NOW SPOKEN I WOULD NOT HAVE STIRRED A FOOT FOR TWICE THAT SUM
FAREWELL BENVENUTO. I STAYED ON A SHORT WHILE AT THE DRAWING I WAS MAKING WHICH WAS A COPY OF A JOVE BY RAFFAELLO
PERHAPS HIS FATHER IS DEAD
WHEN WE REACHED THE PRESENCE THE POPE CAST SO MENACING A GLANCE TOWARDS ME THAT THE MERE LOOK OF HIS EYES MADE ME TREMBLE
WHEN I TOOK HIM HE HAD LEFT A FORMER MASTER NAMED FRANCESCO A SPANIARD AND A GOLDSMITH
CELESTIAL THRONES BEFORE PURGED EYEBALLS SHINE
SO THEN NOT HAVING BEEN REPAID AND KNOWING THAT HE HELD EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE KING I WENT AS I HAVE SAID TO LOOK HIM UP
FOR I AM AN HONEST MAN AND STAND IN NO FEAR OF MY SINS. THE GOVERNOR AND FISCAL ROSE AND SAID THEY WERE GOING TO THE POPE AND SHOULD RETURN WITH ORDERS WHICH I SHOULD SOON LEARN TO MY COST
I RESORTED TO THESE SOMEWHAT RIGOROUS MEASURES BECAUSE HE HAD TOLD ME THAT NO ITALIAN WHOM HE KNEW OF HAD THE POWER OF SPIRIT TO REMOVE ONE RING OF IRON FROM ITS PLACE IN HIS HOUSE
I BEGAN AND OPENED BY ORATION THUS
INDEED HE MADE A BRAVE DEFIANCE
WHEN I ARRIVED THE KING HAD REACHED HIS SECOND COURSE
TURNING TO THE LORDS IN HIS COMPANY HE SPOKE THESE WORDS PRECISELY
I HOWEVER AVOIDED VISITING CARDINAL DE MEDICI
THE MAN DUMBFOUNDED AND AFFRIGHTED GOT HIS FURNITURE TOGETHER AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE
THE MONSANESE IS THE MONT CENIS CELLINI FORGETS THAT HE HAS NOT MENTIONED THIS APPREHENSION WHICH MADE HIM TURN ASIDE FROM MILAN
THE DUKE REPLIED WITHOUT A MOMENTS HESITATION
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL MAKE US ALL BEMOAN YOUR LOSS. A THOUSAND WORDS AND EXCLAMATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN US
I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT SOON BE COMPLETED AND THEN I MEANT TO RETURN TO ITALY BEING NO LONGER ABLE TO PUT UP WITH THE ROGUERIES OF THOSE FRENCHMEN
THE WIFE OF SBIETTA WENT BUSTLING ABOUT IN THE COMPANY OF ONE CECCHINO BUTI THEIR KNAVE OF ALL WORK
THEN I WENT TO THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM OUR INN AND FOUND THERE MY ANGELICA WHO GREETED ME WITH INFINITE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE MOST UNBOUNDED PASSION
THE NAME THAT LEARNED INVENTORS AND INVESTIGATORS OF SUCH ETYMOLOGIES ADDUCE AS THAT FLORENCE IS FLOWING AT THE ARNO CANNOT HOLD
IN HER OTHER HAND I PUT A CORNUCOPIA OVERFLOWING WITH ALL THE NATURAL TREASURES I COULD THINK OF
SO THEN YOURE WELCOME. I SHOWED HIM THE PIECE AND WHILE HE WAS INSPECTING IT I RELATED TO HIM THE WHOLE STORY OF THE THIEF AND OF MY AGONY AND WHAT HAD BEEN MY GREATEST TROUBLE IN THE MATTER
XII ON OUR WAY TO THE LODGINGS OF THE KING WE PASSED BEFORE THOSE OF THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA
CHIEFLY AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY NOT ONLY EXPRESSED YOURSELF SATISFIED BUT PRAISED IT FAR MORE HIGHLY THAN ANY ONE BESIDE
GO AND INSTALL HIM LORD OF THE CASTLE OF THE LITTLE NELLO WHERE HE LIVES AND WHICH IS A PART OF MY DEMESNE HE WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BETTER THAN HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE LETTERS OF NATURALISATION. A MESSENGER BROUGHT ME THE PATENT UPON WHICH I WANTED TO GIVE HIM A GRATUITY
4 HE THEN ASKED HIM HOW THE MAN WAS GOING ON WHOSE HEAD I HAD BROKEN WITH THE STONE
AVERARDO SERRISTORI AND ALESSANDRI IN PARTICULAR MADE A TREMENDOUS STIR ABOUT IT BUT FEDERIGO MANAGED TO PROTECT MATTERS UNTIL THE MAGISTRACY WENT OUT OF OFFICE
IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
I SAID TO FELICE
MY NAME IS BENVENUTO. HE REPLIED
WE WERE ON THE POINT OF COMING TO A FAR WORSE QUARREL THAN BEFORE
A HUNDRED OF THE ABLEST CRAFTSMEN COULD NOT COMPLETE SO MANY GREAT WORKS AS THIS ONE ABLE MAN HAS TAKEN IN HAND TO DO
AT THE MOMENT WHEN I ENTERED THE ROOM I WAS FOLLOWED BY A VERY BRAVE YOUNG SERVING-MAN OF MINE HOLDING A BIG PARTISAN IN HIS HAND
INTRODUCTORY SONNET THIS TALE OF MY SORE-TROUBLED LIFE I WRITE TO THANK THE GOD OF NATURE WHO CONVEYED MY SOUL TO ME AND WITH SUCH CARE HATH STAYED THAT DIVERS NOBLE DEEDS IVE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
I MEANWHILE MADE THE BEST WAY I COULD ON ALL FOURS TOWARD THE CHURCH OF THE TRESPONTINA
FOR THEY HAD OBSERVED THE BANDS OF LINEN FASTENED TO THE GREAT KEEP OF THE CASTLE AND FOLK WERE RUNNING IN CROWDS TO BEHOLD SO EXTRAORDINARY A THING
ANGELO AND OF PASSAGES WHICH HE AFTERWARDS COMPOSED TO BRING THESE PIECES INTO A COHERENT WHOLE
HE KEPT TALKING EVERY DAY ABOUT HIS GALLANT FEATS AMONG THOSE BEASTS OF ENGLISHMEN
THEREFORE SEE THAT HE GETS THE FIRST ABBEY THAT FALLS VACANT WORTH TWO THOUSAND CROWNS A YEAR
AND THE THOUGHT OF ALL MY TROUBLES KEPT RECURRING AND GNAWING AT ME IN THE DARKNESS UNTIL I OFTEN MADE MY MIND UP TO PUT AN END SOMEHOW TO MY OWN LIFE
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO VARIATION IN THE INCIDENTS
HOWEVER I WAS UNABLE TO DO SO
AND IF THERE WERE NEED HE WOULD GLADLY SPEAK FOR ME
THIS HAS BEEN TOLD US BY ONE OF YOUR WORKMEN TO WHOM YOU DISCLOSED THE MATTER IN YOUR BRAGGADOCIO WAY
I USED THE UTMOST DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY TO COMPLETE MY STATUE AND WENT TO SPEND MY EVENINGS IN THE DUKES WARDROBE ASSISTING THERE THE GOLDSMITHS WHO WERE WORKING FOR HIS EXCELLENCY
GIOV
PERHAPS IT WAS HIS EXAMPLE WHICH MOVED THE WHOLE CITY TO SUCH A TUMULT OF ENTHUSIASM
I SOON NOTICED THAT THE STONE RANG FALSE BENEATH MY STROKES WHICH MADE ME OFTEN-TIMES REPENT COMMENCING ON IT
I WAS BRINGING YOU THOSE CROWNS I OWED
THEREFORE I SHALL WAIT UNTIL TO-MORROW BEFORE I DISBURSE MORE MONEY. THE POOR FELLOWS SWALLOWED MY WORDS AND CHEWED THE CUD OF THEM
3 ON MY ARRIVAL I ASKED TO SEE THE DUKE
HE WAS TRAVELLING BY POST
NOW THERE WAS A PERUGIAN WORKMAN IN MY EMPLOY WHO HAD HELPED ME ON THOSE COMMISSIONS FROM THE POPE
I AM BEING MURDERED. IN A MOMENT FOUR OF MY YOUNG MEN CAME RUNNING WITH FOUR PIKES IN THEIR HANDS
YOU ARE ALL DEAD FOLK! MY BLOW DESCENDED ON THE SHOULDER OF LUIGI
HE WAS POISED UPON THE LEFT FOOT THE RIGHT BEING SUPPORTED BY A HELMET OF THE RICHEST IMAGINABLE WORKMANSHIP
YOU WILL NOT HAVE FINISHED IT BEFORE I HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOUR FORTUNE. AFTER I HAD TAKEN LEAVE THE POPE PROCLAIMED BEFORE THE WHOLE COMPANY THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME ENOUGH TO LIVE ON WEALTHILY WITHOUT THE NEED OF LABOURING FOR ANY ONE BUT HIM
NOW THERE WAS A LEGEND IN THE CITY THAT MY CASTLE HAD FROM OLDEN TIMES BEEN HAUNTED BY A SPIRIT THOUGH I NEVER NOTICED ANYTHING TO CONFIRM THIS BELIEF
SO I DISMOUNTED AT THE HOUSE OF MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI CLERK OF THE CAMERA TO WHOSE KEEPING I HAD COMMITTED ON LEAVING ROME MANY OF MY ARMS AND OTHER THINGS I CARED FOR
AND SEEING HIM FALL TERROR-STRUCK TO EARTH I CRIED
THEREFORE I SAID TO MYSELF
SEE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY VOL
HE WAS A GREAT LATINIST AND ONE OF THOSE ECCLESIASTICS WHO EARNESTLY DESIRED A REFORM OF THE CHURCH
AND SEEING THAT HE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS DOING I COURTEOUSLY EXPLAINED MY PLANS
THERE WAS A FINE OLD MAN A GOLDSMITH CALLED RAFFAELLO DEL MORO WHO HAD CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION IN THE TRADE AND WAS TO BOOT A VERY WORTHY FELLOW
HE SENT FOR SPECTACLES AND LIGHTS BUT WAS UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING CLEARLY
OH MY SUN FOR WHOM I HAVE PASSIONATELY YEARNED
THESE TWO WORTHY MEN WENT TOGETHER AND THREW THEMSELVES UPON THEIR KNEES BEFORE THE POPE
6 BEING AWARE OF THIS INTIMACY THE WORTHY GOLDSMITH RAFFAELLO SAID TO MESSER GIOVANNI
THE SUBJECT WAS TO BE HERCULES WRENCHING THE LIONS MOUTH
4 AFTERWARDS I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY HAD THE STONE RESET BY A GERMAN OR SOME OTHER FOREIGNER--WHETHER TRULY OR NOT I CANNOT VOUCH--UPON BERNARDONES SUGGESTION THAT THE DIAMOND WOULD SHOW BETTER IN A LESS ELABORATE SETTING
MONSIGNOR DI VILLEROIS COUNSELLED ME TO LOOK ABOUT FOR SOMETHING ELSE AND BY ALL MEANS TO LEAVE THIS PLACE ALONE SEEING THAT ITS OWNER WAS A MAN OF VAST POWER WHO WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY HAVE ME KILLED
THE CASTELLAN OF SANT ANGELO WAS ONE OF OUR FLORENTINES CALLED MESSER GIORGIO A KNIGHT OF THE UGOLINI FAMILY
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
I PRAISE IT MORE THAN OTHER TONGUES WILL TELL
LET YOUR HOLINESS GIVE THE PLACE TO THIS INGENIOUS PERSON BASTIANO
SEVERAL MONTHS PASSED WITHOUT MY RECEIVING MONEY OR COMMISSIONS
I TOOK THE PAPER AND THE WAX AND BEGAN TO WORK
MY BENVENUTO QUICK QUICK BETAKE THYSELF TO GOD WITH THY ACCUSTOMED PRAYERS AND CRY OUT LOUDLY LOUDLY! IN A SUDDEN CONSTERNATION I FELL UPON MY KNEES AND RECITED SEVERAL OF MY PRAYERS IN A LOUD VOICE
PERHAPS WHEN SHE MEANT TO DO ME HARM SHE DID ME MORE GOOD THAN YOU WERE ABLE TO DO WITH ALL YOUR EFFORTS
TOWARD THE END OF AUGUST 1544 THE IMPERIAL ARMY ADVANCED AS FAR AS EPERNAY WITHIN TWENTY LEAGUES OF PARIS
THEN HAVING THANKED THOSE GENTLEMEN AND FEELING OURSELVES ENTIRELY REFRESHED WE QUITTED THE PLACE AND TRAVELLED ONWARDS THANKING GOD FOR SAVING US FROM SUCH GREAT PERILS
OF A TRUTH I HARDLY THINK THE ANCIENTS CAN HAVE SEEN A PIECE SO BEAUTIFUL AS THIS
STILL I LABOURED DILIGENTLY NIGHT AND DAY UNTIL WHEN I HAD BROUGHT MY WORK TO A POINT WHEN IT COULD BE EXHIBITED I SUBMITTED IT TO THE INSPECTION OF THE BISHOP
CONSEQUENTLY IN THEIR INABILITY TO BEAR UP AGAINST SUCH A CONTINUOUS STRAIN THEY TOOK TO EATING AND DRINKING COPIOUSLY SOME OF THE GERMANS IN PARTICULAR WHO WERE MORE SKILLED THAN THEIR COMRADES AND WANTED TO MARCH APACE WITH ME SANK UNDER THESE EXCESSES AND PERISHED
FILETTI THE SHARP LINES WHICH DIVIDE ONE FACET FROM ANOTHER
HIST
I HAD NOT THEN LEARNED THAT HE WAS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MADAME DETAMPES
ALL HIS AFFECTIONS BEING SET UPON THOSE WONDERFUL STUDIES OF HIS
IT WAS LIKE SHOUTING TO A PACK OF LAME DONKEYS WITH A BLIND DWARF FOR THEIR DRIVER
AND THOUGH I SLEEP AS LIGHTLY AS EVER YET DID MAN UPON THIS EARTH YET AFTER INDULGENCE IN SEXUAL PLEASURE MY SLUMBER IS SOMETIMES VERY DEEP AND HEAVY
HE SAID
NIGHT HAD FALLEN
BE QUICK ABOUT IT IF YOU DO NOT WANT US TO USE OTHER MEASURES THAN WORDS. THEN THEY BEGAN TO RISE AND LEAVE THE CHAMBER
1 IT GAVE MUCH PLEASURE WHEN IT WAS COMPLETED THOUGH MY SOLE OBJECT IN MAKING IT WAS TO OBTAIN EXPERIENCE OF CLAYS SUITABLE FOR BRONZE-CASTING
DOUBLY ENRAGED BY THIS HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON ME
AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS THE RASCAL DECAMPED FROM MY SHOP LEAVING ME IN THE LURCH WITH A MASS OF BUSINESS ON MY HANDS AND SAYING THAT HE DID NOT MEAN TO PAY ME A FARTHING MORE
ABOUT THIS TIME THE EMPEROR RETURNED VICTORIOUS FROM HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST TUNIS AND THE POPE SENT FOR ME TO TAKE MY ADVICE CONCERNING THE PRESENT OF HONOUR IT WAS FIT TO GIVE HIM
XXXV DURING THE COURSE OF MY ARTILLERY PRACTICE WHICH I NEVER INTERMITTED THROUGH THE WHOLE MONTH PASSED BY US BELEAGUERED IN THE CASTLE I MET WITH A GREAT MANY VERY STRIKING ACCIDENTS ALL OF THEM WORTHY TO BE RELATED
THE REASON OF THIS WAS THAT FROM CAUSES I HAVE RECENTLY DESCRIBED THE BRONZE WAS HOTTER THAN OUR RULES OF ART PRESCRIBE
THIS THE CARDINAL DID
WHILE THEY WERE TAKING LEAVE THE AMBASSADOR OF LUCCA SAID TO THE DUKE
BUT WHEN I CAME TO SELCIATA 1 I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF WITH GREAT ADDRESS AND BODILY PROWESS FROM SEVERAL HORSEMEN WHO CAME OUT TO ASSASSINATE ME
I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO INSPECT THE FURNACE AND FOUND THAT THE METAL WAS ALL CURDLED
THE FRENCH AND THEIR COURT WERE BOTH GROWN IRKSOME TO ME AND I COUNTED THE HOURS TILL I COULD FIND MYSELF AGAIN IN ROME
THIS PRINCE KEPT IN HIS SERVICE A MULTITUDE OF SOLDIERS WORTHY FELLOWS BROUGHT UP TO VALOUR IN THE SCHOOL OF THAT FAMOUS GENERAL GIOVANNI DE MEDICI
NOR VIPER WITH MORE VENOMOUS FANG DID FEED
MEANWHILE THE FEAST OF OUR LADY CAME ROUND
THIS IS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DIVINE A THING THAT I HAD EVER DREAMED OF
NOW I DO NOT WANT TO MAINTAIN ANOTHER MANS BASTARDS NOR WILL I SIT DOWN UNDER SUCH AN INSULT
4 SO I RALLIED MY SPIRITS AND KEPT PRODDING AT LATTANZIO GORINI TO MAKE HIM GO A LITTLE FASTER
FOR I OUGHT TO SAY THAT THE LATTER WAS IN THE BANCHI WHILE I LIVED BEHIND THE BANCHI AND WENT RARELY TO THE SHOP
AND THE FOUNDER OF IT WAS A SCULPTOR WITH THE NAME OF MICHEL AGNOLO
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THAT BUST PLEASES ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN THOSE ANTIQUES
FORSOOTH IF I WANTED TO ORNAMENT MY BIOGRAPHY WITH SUCH MATTERS I SHOULD HAVE FAR TOO MUCH TO TELL
HOLDING MY TONGUE THUS THE KING REPEATED THE SAME WORDS A SECOND TIME ANGRILY
I DID NOT DISCLOSE MY DISCOVERY THAT THE STONE WAS NOT A DIAMOND BUT TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD MOST ASSUREDLY POISONED ME AFTER THE DEATH OF THAT MOST WORTHY MAN THE CASTELLAN
WE TALKED A LITTLE ON THIS SUBJECT
I WILL ADD AN EAGLE IN ORDER THAT WE MAY CHRISTEN THE LAD GANYMEDE
SEE HAYDONS AUTOBIOGRAPHY PASSIM NOTE 2
DEAD I FOUND HIM AND THEREFORE I TOLD YOU SO. THEN THEY LIFTED ME FROM WHERE I LAY AND AFTER SHAKING UP THE MATTRESS WHICH WAS NOW AS SOPPY AS A DISH OF MACCARONI THEY FLUNG IT OUTSIDE THE DUNGEON
AND CERTAINLY I SHOULD THEN HAVE KILLED HIM WITH THE KNIFE I HELD BUT THAT HE WAS RIDING A WHITE HORSE TO WHICH HE CLAPPED SPURS LEAVING HIS CAPE IN MY GRASP IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HIS LIFE
THE WHOLE MIRROR TOGETHER WITH THE VIRTUES WAS PLACED IN EQUILIBRIUM SO THAT WHEN THE WHEEL TURNED ALL THE VIRTUES MOVED AND THEY HAD WEIGHTS AT THEIR FEET WHICH KEPT THEM UPRIGHT
WHEN THE CARDINAL HEARD THAT HE BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER AND CRIED
BUT ABOVE ALL HE WAS THE MOST AMUSING COMRADE AND THE HEARTIEST GOOD FELLOW IN THE UNIVERSE
THIS WORTHY MAN LEFT HIS SHOP FOR THE THREE DAYS THAT I SPENT IN NAPLES NOR EVEN QUITTED MY COMPANY BUT SHOWED ME MANY ADMIRABLE MONUMENTS OF ANTIQUITY IN THE CITY AND ITS NEIGBOURHOOD
I REPLIED THAT I HAD SOME PIECES READY TO SHOW HIS MAJESTY IF HE PLEASED AT ONCE
NOW THIS GIOVAN FRANCESCO AND I WERE RIVALS IN SHOOTING WILDFOWL
THE COLD HOWEVER WAS VERY GREAT AND I FELT MY LEG FREEZE SO THAT I SAID TO FELICE
YOU ARE A FELLOW OF WORDS NOT DEEDS. HE ANSWERED
I MAY REMIND MY READERS THAT THE THREE MEDICI OF THE RULING HOUSE WERE NOW ILLEGITIMATE
TOWARD TWENTY-FOUR OCLOCK HE SENT FOR ME
JUST AT THIS TIME I SUFFERED SLIGHTLY IN THE LOINS AND BEING UNABLE TO WORK HARD I WAS GLAD TO PASS MY TIME IN THE DUKES WARDROBE WITH A COUPLE OF YOUNG GOLDSMITHS CALLED GIANPAGOLO AND DOMENICO POGGINI 1 WHO MADE A LITTLE GOLDEN CUP UNDER MY DIRECTION
BUT I WHO KNEW NOT WHAT THE COLOUR OF FEAR WAS PAID THEM LITTLE OR NO HEED
ON APPLYING MY SENSES STRICTLY TO THE MATTER THE VERDICT OF MY EYESIGHT WAS THAT THEY WERE CERTAINLY FRAGMENTS OF POUNDED DIAMOND
ALLE SUE COMODITâ LXXXVIII WHILE I WAS WORKING AT THESE BAGATELLES THE PRINCE AND DON GIOVANNI AND DON ARNANDO AND DON GARZIA KEPT ALWAYS HOVERING AROUND ME TEASING ME WHENEVER THE DUKES EYES WERE TURNED
354 NOTE
THE SMALL MODEL WHICH I SAW IN HIS HOUSE PLEASED ME GREATLY BUT THIS HAS FAR EXCEEDED IT IN MERIT. NOTE 1
ONLY I MADE INQUIRIES TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AS TO WHETHER SBIETTA AND HIS BROTHER SER FILIPPO WERE WELL OFF ENOUGH TO GIVE ME GOOD SECURITY
AND I NEVER STOPPED WORKING FOR THAT EXCELLENT AND GENTLE LADY WHO PAID ME EXCEEDINGLY WELL AND BY WHOSE MEANS PERHAPS IT WAS THAT I CAME TO MAKE A FIGURE IN THE WORLD
AND IF I SO SUCCEED I FEEL CONVINCED THAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY WILL VERY WELL REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAVE ENGAGED TO DO FOR ME. THIS LANGUAGE SO CHARMED THE DUKE BOTH WITH MY WAYS OF ACTING AND OF SPEAKING THAT HE AND THE DUCHESS BEGAN TO TREAT ME WITH EXTRAORDINARY MARKS OF FAVOUR
AND THIS CAME FROM THE SPECIAL GIFT WHICH THE GOD OF NATURE BESTOWED ON ME THAT IS TO SAY A TEMPERAMENT SO HAPPY AND OF SUCH EXCELLENT PARTS THAT I WAS FREELY ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER IT PLEASED ME TO TAKE IN HAND
IF IT APPEARS TO YOUR MAJESTY THAT MY ACTIONS CONTRADICT THESE WORDS LET YOUR MAJESTY BE SURE THAT BENVENUTO WAS NOT AT FAULT BUT RATHER POSSIBLY MY EVIL FATE OR ADVERSE FORTUNE WHICH HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY TO SERVE THE MOST ADMIRABLE PRINCE WHO EVER BLESSED THIS EARTH
I WAS OF COURSE AWARE THAT THE ADMIRABLE SCULPTOR DONATELLO HAD CAST HIS BRONZES WITH THE CLAY OF FLORENCE
ONE SUNDAY EVENING JUST BEFORE NIGHTFALL HE HAPPENED TO FIND HIMSELF BETWEEN THE GATE SAN GALLO AND THE PORTA A PINTI
OH MY GOOD SON WITH THESE ARMS IN THY HAND THOU SHALT EITHER LIVE OR DIE. PIER LANDI WHO WAS PRESENT KEPT SHEDDING TEARS
PAGOLO AND ASCANIO EXCLAIMED
AND IF THE DIAMOND OF WHICH I SPEAK BE MISSING I HAVE TOLD YOU WHERE IT WENT
DONATELLOS JUDITH SYMBOLISING JUSTIFIABLE REGICIDE AND MICHEL ANGELOS DAVID SYMBOLISING THE MIGHT OF INNOCENT RIGHT AGAINST AN OVERBEARING USURPER ALREADY DECORATED THE FLORENTINE PIAZZA
MOREOVER WHEN I SAW HER BODY ALL TORN AND BRUISED AND SWOLLEN I REFLECTED THAT EVEN IF I PERSUADED HER TO RETURN I SHOULD HAVE TO PUT HER UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR AT LEAST A FORTNIGHT BEFORE I COULD MAKE USE OF HER
I RAN INTO THE SHOP AND MADE A LITTLE SCALPING-IRON OF STEEL EXTREMELY THIN AND CURVED
THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
BUT I WOULD NOT CONSENT ALTHOUGH I FELT SURE I SHOULD INCUR HIS ANGER
THIS WAS A GIRDLE THREE INCHES BROAD WHICH USED TO BE MADE FOR BRIDES AND WAS EXECUTED IN HALF RELIEF WITH SOME SMALL FIGURES IN THE ROUND
IN THOSE TOO WHICH DAILY ASSAIL ME I ALWAYS CARRY MY COMPLAINT TO HIM AND CALL ON HIM TO BE MY DEFENDER
THEN HE PACIFIED ME GOOD-HUMOUREDLY AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
LEAVING THE PONIARD THEN I MADE OFF AND FEARING I MIGHT BE RECOGNISED TOOK REFUGE IN THE PALACE OF DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH WAS BETWEEN PIAZZA NAVONA AND THE ROTUNDA
IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO DARE IT I WILL AMPLY SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY. ACCORDINGLY WE AGREED UPON ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE
TO THIS BRANCH TOO I DEVOTED MYSELF WITH ALL MY STRENGTH ALTHOUGH IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THE FIRE WHICH AFTER LONG TIME AND TROUBLE SPENT IN OTHER PROCESSES HAS TO BE APPLIED AT LAST AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY BRINGS THE WHOLE TO RUIN
XIII NOW LET US RETURN TO PIERO TORRIGIANI WHO WITH MY DRAWING IN HIS HAND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
JACOPO
IF YOUR EXCELLENCY CAN PROVE ON REFERRING TO THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN THESE CALUMNIES OR TO OTHERS THAT I HAVE EVER FROM THE DAY OF MY BIRTH TILL NOW GOT ANY SINGLE THING BY FRAUD FROM ANYBODY BE IT IN ROME OR BE IT IN FRANCE THEN LET YOUR EXCELLENCY PUNISH ME AS IMMODERATELY AS YOU CHOOSE. WHEN THE DUKE SAW ME IN THIS MIGHTY PASSION HE ASSUMED THE AIR OF A PRUDENT AND BENEVOLENT LORD SAYING
YAH
THE MS
I RETORTED
AFTER THIS THEY BOTH TOOK SEATS IN FRONT OF THE STATUES AND FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS WENT ON TALKING ABOUT NOTHING BUT THE BEAUTIES OF THE WORK
IT WAS HERE THAT RAPHAEL PAINTED HIS GALATEA AND THE WHOLE FABLE OF CUPID AND PSYCHE
THIS TOOK PLACE ON THE 8TH AND 9TH OCTOBER 1530
THAT ON THE REVERSE RAN AS FOLLOWS
MOTO PROPIO CELLINI CONFUSES HIS PETITION WITH THE INSTRUMENT WHICH HE HAD PROBABLY DRAWN UP READY FOR SIGNATURE
WHAT
THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU
FEDERIGO GONZAGO WAS AT THIS TIME MARQUIS OF MANTUA
9 HIM I BEHELD WHO DRIVES AND CHECKS THE SUN CLAD WITH ITS SPLENDOUR MID HIS COURT ON HIGH SELD-SEEN BY MORTAL EYES IF EER BY ONE
HENCEFORWARD YOU WILL TREAD DOWN POVERTY AND WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO FRANCE WEARING OUT YOUR LIFE IN THIS PLACE AND IN THAT
IN THIS LONG STRUGGLE OF THE SOUL I SPENT SOME TIME
TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND CROWNS AND MORE BENVENUTO DID THAT STONE COST ME! HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE DEPARTED
FOR WE HAVE SOME PROOFS AGAINST HIM. UPON THIS THE POPE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR OF ROME AND BADE HIM SEE HE FOUND THE MALEFACTOR
AND THE CHARMING LADY TOOK OUT A HANDKERCHIEF RICHLY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD WISHING TO MAKE A BANDAGE WITH IT
TO ALL THIS HE MADE ABSOLUTELY NO ANSWER BUT RATHER SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN MY COMMUNICATION ILL
AND YOU
OUT OF THE SHEETS I CUT STRIPS THE THIRD OF A CUBIT IN BREADTH
HE TOO BORE THE NAME OF PAGOLO AND WAS THE SON OF A POOR NOBLEMAN OF THE FAMILY OF THE MACARONI
CONSIDER THIS ONE AND THEN THAT
I REJOINED THAT MY ACHIEVEMENTS WOULD RESOLVE HIS DUBITATIONS AND DEBATES
HE WOULD MAKE SUCH TERMS WITH ME AS WOULD CAUSE ME TO FEEL SATISFIED
ONLY IN REPLY I PROTEST THAT MY HEART HAS EVER BEEN BY DAY AND NIGHT WITH ALL MY VITAL FORCES BENT ON SERVING YOU AND EXECUTING YOUR COMMANDS
AND IF THE MATTER CAME TO KNOWLEDGE THE WRETCHED FELLOWS RAN RISK OF THE GALLEYS
AND THIS IS MY OPINION ALSO. THEN HE CALLED HIS CHAMBERLAIN MESSER TRAIANO AND BADE HIM BRING FIVE HUNDRED GOLDEN DUCATS OF THE CAMERA
WE JOURNEYED BY THE MONSANESE AVOIDING THE CITY OF MILAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPREHENSION I HAVE SPOKEN OF 1 SO THAT WE ARRIVED SAFE AND SOUND AT LYONS
I TRIED TO GET OUT OF DOING IT BUT THE DUKE COMPELLED ME BY ALL SORTS OF KINDLY PRESSURE TO WORK UNTIL FOUR HOURS AFTER NIGHTFALL
SOMEWHAT TERRIFIED AT THIS CALAMITY I BEGAN TO TAKE CERTAIN AMUSEMENTS AS MY MIND SUGGESTED AND FOR A REASON WHICH I WILL PRESENTLY RELATE
SUO AUDITORE NOTE 3
IF THEN YOU ARE THE BENVENUTO OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD, REPLIED THE KING ACT ACCORDING TO YOUR WONT FOR YOU HAVE MY FULL LEAVE TO DO SO. I TOLD HIS MAJESTY THAT ALL I WANTED WAS TO KEEP HIS FAVOUR
OH MY DEAR BROTHER THOUGH YOU ARE BRINGING DESTRUCTION ON YOUR HEAD I CANNOT BUT FULFIL YOUR WISHES
NOW THAT DAY THEY HAD THROWN A HEAP OF PLASTER AND BROKEN TILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHICH NEITHER MY HORSE NOR MYSELF PERCEIVED
HE STOOD HIGH IN THE FAVOUR OF DUKE COSIMO DE MEDICI WHO TOOK HIS OPINION ON THE WORK OF OTHER CRAFTSMEN
THIS WAS MARCH 22 1540
METHOUGHT I ANSWERED THAT NOTHING WOULD INDUCE ME TO DO SO
BUT YOU WILL SOON SEE THAT HE CANNOT SUCCEED IN THAT OTHER SPHERE OF ART. TO THESE VILE SUGGESTIONS HE ADDED MANY OTHERS OF ALL SORTS PLYING HIS SPYS OFFICE AND PILING UP A MOUNTAIN OF LIES TO BOOT
AND OVER AND ABOVE THE WORKS HE HAD COMMISSIONED 1 HE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAD DONE ON MY ACCOUNT IN THE INTERVAL
WHEN I SAW THAT THE FIR BOUGH OFFERED NO PROTECTION AND THAT I OUGHT TO ACT AS WELL AS TO INTONE MY MISERERES I BEGAN AT ONCE TO WRAP MY MANTLE ROUND MY HEAD
XVII JUST AS I LEFT THE HOUSE I OBSERVED SOME SERVANTS WHISPERING AMONG THEMSELVES WHO ALSO WENT OFF AT A ROUND PACE IN ANOTHER DIRECTION FROM THE ONE I TOOK
SO I ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE PRINCE
2 AND SHOWING ME A LEATHER CASE FOR A CUP HE HAD WITH HIM WHISPERED IN MY EAR THAT IT HELD A GOBLET OF SILVER WHICH CONTAINED JEWELS TO THE VALUE OF MANY THOUSANDS OF DUCATS TOGETHER WITH LETTERS OF VAST CONSEQUENCE SENT BY MESSER FILIPPO STROZZI
HE DIED AGED SEVENTY-SEVEN IN 1547
3 IT HAD SAN GIOVANNI IN PROFILE SEATED WITH A BOOK IN HIS HAND FINER IN MY JUDGMENT THAN ANYTHING WHICH I HAD DONE
I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE NOT TO LET THOSE SUSPICIONS DEPRIVE YOU OF SO GREAT A WINDFALL. ALL THE SAME I BEGGED HIM WITH CLASPED HANDS TO AID ME IN ESCAPING FROM THAT PLACE SAYING I KNEW WELL THAT A POPE OF THAT SORT THOUGH HE COULD DO ME MUCH GOOD IF HE CHOSE WAS REALLY STUDYING SECRETLY AND TO SAVE APPEARANCES HOW HE MIGHT BEST DESTROY ME
FOR HAVING TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS THE FRESH GRASS I MEANT THAT HE SHOULD SWIM AND DRAW ME AFTER HIM
THE BEAST WAS ADMIRABLY TRAINED TO HAND SO THAT LUIGI COULD GO DAILY TO CARACOLE AROUND THE LODGINGS OF THAT PROSTITUTE PANTASILEA
I TOUCHED HIM AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE INFURIATED OLD MAN WITHDREW
THE WORDS THAT PASSED BETWEEN US WERE AWFUL AND I REFUSED TO TAKE THE STONE IN ANY OTHER WAY
AND WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU I AM SAYING FROM HIS EXCELLENCYS LIPS. THEN I REJOINED THAT IF THE MESSAGE CAME FROM HIS EXCELLENCY I WOULD GLADLY REPLY AND TOLD HIM TO REPORT TO THE DUKE THAT I COULD NOT ACCEPT A POSITION INFERIOR TO THAT OF ANY ONE EMPLOYED BY HIM AS ARTIST
SO I AROSE AND WHEN I REACHED THE BANCHI I MET A MAN CALLED SER BENEDETTO WHO WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
GO FORWARD
GIULIAN DI BACCIO DAGNOLO THE WOOD-CARVER HAD THE GATE OF SAN GIORGIO
SHE WAS FURIOUSLY ENRAGED BECAUSE OF THE PLEASANT TRICK BY WHICH I BROUGHT DIEGO TO OUR BANQUET AND SHE SWORE TO BE REVENGED ON ME
HE THEN ADVISED THE KING TO LET ME LABOUR AS MUCH OR LITTLE AS I LIKED
MAESTRO FRANCESCO ANSWERED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WELL FOR ME TO LET BLOOD THEN BUT THAT IF I HAD DONE SO BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE ESCAPED WITHOUT MISCHIEF
MESSER LUDOVICO ASKED ME WHAT IT WAS I SEEMED TO SEE AND HOW THE MAN WAS SHAPED
AFTER THAT GO WHERE YOU LIKE AND LET FOOLS DIE AT THEIR OWN PLEASURE. I WENT HOME AND SET MYSELF TO FINISHING THE MEDAL WHICH I HAD BEGUN WITH THE HEAD OF POPE CLEMENT AND A FIGURE OF PEACE ON THE REVERSE
AND IT SEEMS TO US THAT THAT COUNTRYMAN OF YOURS HAS ACTED TOWARDS YOU IN A MOST UNWARRANTABLE MANNER
AFTERWARDS WHEN HE KNEW THAT I WAS GONE HE SENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS WHO CAUGHT ME UP AT SIENA AND GAVE ME FIFTY GOLDEN DUCATS WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE DUKE THAT I SHOULD TAKE AND USE THEM FOR HIS SAKE AND SHOULD RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THEN HE MADE A TILE RED-HOT AND CAST UPON IT A GOOD HANDFUL OF WORMWOOD
I THEN MADE DIES FOR A GIULIO
NOW THESE MEN HAVE PLACED THEMSELVES ENTIRELY IN MY HANDS; AND HE SHOWED ME A WRITING TO THIS EFFECT SIGNED BY THEM
THEREFORE UP AT ONCE AND FLING A HANDFUL OF THAT ASSAFETIDA UPON THE FIRE. AGNOLO AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE MOVED TO DO THIS LET FLY SUCH A VOLLEY FROM HIS BREECH THAT IT WAS FAR MORE EFFECTUAL THAN THE ASSAFETIDA
1 THE BOY ROUSED BY THAT GREAT STENCH AND NOISE LIFTED HIS FACE LITTLE AND HEARING ME LAUGH HE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND SAID THE DEVILS WERE TAKING TO FLIGHT TEMPESTUOUSLY
XI ON LEAVING THE CARDINAL I REPAIRED TO MY LODGING WHICH WAS THREE MILES DISTANT IN COMPANY WITH A SECRETARY OF THE CARDINAL RETURNING TO THE SAME QUARTERS
IT HAPPENED ON ONE OCCASION THAT ASCANIO WHO CAME TWICE A DAY TO VISIT ME ASKED TO HAVE A JACKET CUT OUT FOR HIM FROM A BLUE SILK VEST OF MINE I NEVER USED
THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
PONTE A SELICE BETWEEN CAPUA AND AVERSA
PROVIDED ONLY THAT HE GOES ON WORKING. POMPEO CAME TO ME CALLED ME OUTSIDE THE SHOP AND HEAPED ON ME THE MOST MAWKISH CARESSES OF A DONKEY 1 REPORTING EVERYTHING THE POPE HAD ORDERED
HE IS THE GREATEST ARTIST WHO WAS EVER BORN IN HIS OWN CRAFT
XIX AT SIENA I WAITED FOR THE MAIL TO ROME WHICH I AFTERWARDS JOINED
SO THAT EACH OF THEM MIGHT MIND HIS BUSINESS
AND SINCE HE CAME TO US BOTH THIN AND PALE OF FACE WE CALLED HIM THE LITTLE OLD MAN; INDEED I ALMOST THOUGHT HE WAS ONE PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS SO GOOD A SERVANT AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS SO CLEVER THAT IT SEEMED UNLIKELY HE SHOULD HAVE SUCH TALENT AT THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH HE AFFIRMED HIS AGE TO BE
THERE ARRIVED IN ROME A SURGEON OF THE HIGHEST RENOWN WHO WAS CALLED MAESTRO GIACOMO DA CARPI
I LIKEWISE OBTAINED COMMISSIONS FROM CARDINAL CORNARO AND MANY OTHERS OF THE HOLY COLLEGE ESPECIALLY RIDOLFI AND SALVIATI
THEN THE PRIEST SAID
ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO RUN AFTER HIM. WHEN I LEFT THE PRESENCE I CONTINUED WORKING AT THE JEWEL AND THE DIES 1 FOR THE MINT
I SENT MY OLD SERVING-WOMAN NAMED RUBERTA WHO HAD A MOST KINDLY DISPOSITION TO HELP HER DRESS
I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN
I SET PAGOLO WHOM I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TO WORK UPON THE BASIN
I FELT TEMPTED TO PACK OFF AT ONCE AND BID FAREWELL TO ITALY
CELLINIS CAPITOLO IN PRAISE OF THE PRISON IS CLEARLY MADE UP OF PIECES WRITTEN AS ESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE DUNGEON OF S
WHEN THE SKETCH WAS FINISHED ANOTHER ROMAN LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY JOINED US
TO THIS THE VULGAR COURTIER ANSWERED
GOOD BRETHREN WHY DID NOT YOU CONSULT YOUR COMMITTEE BEFORE YOU ALLOWED ME TO PLACE MY CRUCIFIX
WHEREUPON THE POPE SAID
VII WHEN MY FATHER SPOKE TO ME IN THE WAY I HAVE ABOVE DESCRIBED I ENTREATED HIM TO LET ME DRAW A CERTAIN FIXED NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE DAY
4 THE POPE REPLIED
WHY DOES NOT BENVENUTO COME BACK TO US? HE PUT SEARCHING QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT TO MY TWO WORKMEN BOTH OF WHOM REPLIED THAT I KEPT WRITING I WAS WELL OFF WHERE I WAS ADDING THEY THOUGHT I DID NOT WANT TO RE-ENTER THE SERVICE OF HIS MAJESTY
FOR THE SPACE OF A WHOLE HOUR I PRAYED FERVENTLY TO GOD RETURNING THANKS TO HIM FOR SO MERCIFUL A DEATH
IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING MARVELLOUS THAT THE RAYS SHOULD BE REMOVED IN THAT MANNER
WELL THE KING AS I HAVE SAID CAME TO PARIS AND PAID ME A VISIT SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL
WHILE HE WAS CHANTING THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD MY BEAUTY BETWEEN THEM NEVER LEFT OFF CHATTERING
BENVENUTO DO AS THOU ART WONT AND FEAR NOT! THEN ON THE INSTANT I CHANGED THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY PLANS AND SAID TO MY ITALIANS
IT SEEMED TO ME HOWEVER THAT THAT THIEF OF A TREASURER WAS DOING ALL HE COULD TO POSTPONE THE PAYMENT OF THE MONEY
SO I PRAYED HIM NOT TO LEAVE ME FOR A SECOND
VIRTUOSAMENTE CELLINI USES THE WORD VIRTUOSO IN MANY SENSES BUT ALWAYS MORE WITH REFERENCE TO INTELLECTUAL THAN MORAL QUALITIES
SO DO AS I COMMAND AND FOLLOW ME. THEY ALL BEGAN TOGETHER WITH ONE HEART AND VOICE TO SAY
I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AND KEPT REVOLVING SAD THOUGHTS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT
THE OTHER HAD THE SAME POSTURE OF SUPPORT
LXXV MESSER LATINO JUVINALE CAME TO CALL ON ME AND GAVE ME ORDERS TO STRIKE THE COINS OF THE POPE
AND WHEN ON OPENING THE CHEST THEY SAW THE PRECIOUS STONES AND MY WORK WITH THEM THEY TOOK HEART OF JOY AND SHOUTED
I REPLIED THAT MY GREATEST REWARD AND WHAT I MOST DESIRED WAS TO HAVE RIVALLED THE MASTERPIECES OF SO EMINENT AN ARTIST
BENEDETTO ACCOLTI OF AREZZO ARCHBISHOP OF RAVENNA IN 1524 OBTAINED THE HAT IN 1527 THREE DAYS BEFORE THE SACK OF ROME
FROM THAT POINT ONWARD WE TRAVELLED TO PARIS WITHOUT THE LEAST TROUBLE IN THE WORLD
THEN I PRAYED MORE DEVOUTLY THAN EVER I HAD DONE IN THE PAST FERVENTLY IMPLORING CHRIST THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST GRANT ME THE FAVOUR OF KNOWING BY DIVINE INSPIRATION WHAT SIN I WAS SO SORELY EXPIATING
SO I DREW NEARER TO HIS MAJESTY FOR THEY WERE SHOWING HIM SOME THINGS IN MY OWN LINE OF ART
AT THE SAME INSTANT I CRIED OUT
XXIX TWO DAYS AFTER THIS CONVERSATION M
I SHALL CALL HIM BARGELLO ALWAYS IN MY TRANSLATION SINCE ANY ENGLISH EQUIVALENT WOULD BE MISLEADING
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO HAVE NO COURAGE TO QUIT THIS GO-CART BUT MUST ALWAYS CREEP ABOUT IN LEADING-STRINGS
AT THE SAME TIME I KEPT STIRRING UP THE CHANNELS AND SENT MEN UPON THE ROOF TO STOP THE CONFLAGRATION WHICH HAD GATHERED FORCE FROM THE INCREASED COMBUSTION IN THE FURNACE
AND NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT FOR THE MONEY HE SAID WITH HIS USUAL BRUTAL ARROGANCE
I MADE HIM ANSWER THAT WHENEVER I CHOSE I SHOULD ALWAYS BE CAPABLE OF WORKING AT GREAT SILVER PIECES
WITHOUT INFORMING THE OTHER ILL-DISPOSED SERVANTS WHO WERE MY ENEMIES HE HANDED IT TO THE CASTELLAN
IT CAME AFTERWARDS TO FLORENCE
SO THEN I TOLD DUKE ALESSANDRO THAT I WANTED FIRST TO GO TO VENICE AND THAT AFTERWARDS I WOULD RETURN TO SERVE HIM
ONE DAY WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER I WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF HIS MARVELLOUS WORKS AND THE MAN HIMSELF TO BOOT
THESE JEWELS WERE EXCELLENTLY EXECUTED BY MY WORKMEN AFTER MY OWN DESIGNS
THEY BECAME HIM WELL FOR HE WAS HANDSOME OF FACE AND FIGURE AND HAD A GENTLE VOICE
IT IS NOW IN THE MUSEO PIO CLEMENTINO OF THE VATICAN
BEING THUS DAILY EXPOSED TO DIVERS PERSECUTIONS I PONDERED WHICH OF TWO COURSES I OUGHT TO TAKE
MESSER SFORZA REPORTED THESE PRECISE WORDS TO ME ON THE SAME EVENING LAUGHING TOO AND EXPRESSING WONDER AT THE GREAT FAVOUR SHOWN ME BY THE DUKE
THE FRIARS TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT GRANT THIS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THEIR BUILDING COMMITTEE
AFTER WHICH HE SPRINKLED THE GREEK WINE
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
I REPLIED
AT LAST WHEN HE SAW THAT I WAS NOT COMING TO HIM HE CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME WHAT I WAS ABOUT
I MEANT TO MAKE IT TOPPLE OVER ON MY HEAD AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DASHED MY BRAINS OUT
WHEN I HAD UTTERED THESE WORDS AND MANY OTHERS TO THE LIKE EFFECT RAFFAELLO KEPT ON BLANDLY URGING THAT IT WAS FAR BETTER TO EAT A THRUSH IN PEACE THAN TO BRING A FAT CAPON TO ONES TABLE EVEN THOUGH ONE WERE QUITE SURE TO GET IT AFTER A HOT FIGHT
PRINCE BENVENUTO HAS PLACED HIMSELF IN MY HANDS AND HAS BEGGED ME TO RECOMMEND HIM TO YOUR EXCELLENCY. THE DUKE REPLIED
UPON THIS POINT OF DISCIPLINE I WAS EXTREMELY STRICT
PARTLY BECAUSE I SAW THAT THE POPE DID NOT HOLD ME IN THE SAME ESTEEM AS FORMERLY MY FAITHFUL SERVICE HAVING BEEN BESMIRCHED BY LYING TONGUES
NOW MESSER ALBERTO WAS A MAN OF STERLING WORTH BUT PROUD AND ILLNESS HAD MADE HIS HAUGHTY TEMPER INSUPPORTABLE
SO FINDING THERE AROUND HIM SEVERAL YOUNG FELLOWS OF THE HIGHEST DARING MORE EAGER THAN APT FOR SO SERIOUS AN ENTERPRISE HE BADE THEM CATCH UP CAPTAIN CISTI AND GET THE MONEY FROM HIM AND IF THE GUARD RESISTED OVERPOWER THE MEN PROVIDED THEY HAD PLUCK ENOUGH TO DO SO
YOU MUST KNOW THEN THAT THAT WORTHLESS PRIEST SER FILIPPO NOT MANY DAYS SINCE WENT ABOUT BOASTING OF HIS BROTHER SBIETTAS CLEVERNESS AND TELLING HOW HE HAD SOLD HIS FARM TO AN OLD MAN FOR HIS LIFETIME AND THAT THE PURCHASER COULD HARDLY LIVE THE YEAR OUT
GERMAIN-EN-LAYE IS NOT SO FAR FROM PARIS AS CELLINI THOUGHT
THERE I BUILT A LITTLE DRAUGHT-FURNACE OF BRICKS WITH A LARGISH POT SHAPED LIKE AN OPEN DISH AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
GO MY BENVENUTO MAKE A MODEL AND EARN THAT FINE MARBLE FOR YOURSELF
THE BOSS EXPANDED AND SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO THE SHAPE OF A MOST BEAUTIFUL MADONNA WHO APPEARED TO BE SITTING ENTHRONED ON HIGH HOLDING HER CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH AN ATTITUDE OF THE GREATEST CHARM AND A SMILE UPON HER FACE
THOUGH THE WOUND WAS NOT OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IT SEEMED TO BE SO BECAUSE IT BLED ABUNDANTLY
SO THEY TOLD ME IF I DID NOT CALL THE BRUTE OFF THEY WOULD KILL HIM
THIS ATTITUDE WAS THEREFORE METAPHORICALLY APPROPRIATE
ON ARRIVING THEY SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
FIRENZUOLA CRIED
THEN HE ASSUMED A TONE OF SYMPATHY AND ADDED
7 NEXT I BEHELD A BIER OF SOMBRE HUE ADORNED WITH BROKEN LILIES
I WILL SEND FOR BENVENUTO AND IN ORDER TO GRATIFY THE WHIM I HAVE WILL PUT HIM IN THOSE ROOMS WHICH OPEN ON MY PRIVATE GARDEN
THE FORMER CRIED OUT THAT NO ONE WAS BADLY WOUNDED
WHEN I SAID THAT HE GAVE VENT TO OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE IN FRENCH WHEREAT I RETORTED IN MY OWN TONGUE THAT HE LIED
ABOUT THAT TIME I CONTRACTED A CLOSE AND FAMILIAR FRIENDSHIP WITH AN AMIABLE LAD OF MY OWN AGE WHO WAS ALSO IN THE GOLDSMITHS TRADE
2 IT MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE DASHED OUT THE BRAINS OF BOTH OF THEM EXCEPT THAT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT FARNESE WAS REPROACHING SALVIATI WITH HAVING CAUSED THE SACK OF ROME AND WHILE THEY STOOD APART FROM ONE ANOTHER TO EXCHANGE OPPROBRIOUS REMARKS MY GABION FELL WITHOUT DESTROYING THEM
FROM NEIGHBOURING BUILDINGS SUCH AS THE TORRE DE BINI WE RAN GREAT PERIL WHEN THEY WERE THERE
THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT I BEGAN TO RECOVER FROM MY PHYSICAL DEPRESSION WHICH HAD REACHED A VERY SERIOUS DEGREE
WHEN I TOOK THEM TO HER EXCELLENCY SHE RECEIVED ME MOST GRACIOUSLY AND REPAID THE GOLD AND SILVER I HAD SPENT UPON THEM
I DISCOVERED THAT WHEREAS I MADE THEM AN ALLOWANCE OF FOUR GOLDEN CROWNS A MONTH THEY ALWAYS DREW CONSIDERABLE SUMS FROM THE CURRENT SALE OF THESE ARTICLES
PROBABLY THE DOVERIA IN THE VALDIVEDRO
THEN HE RAN OFF TO MADAME DETAMPES AND PAINTED A PICTURE OF ME LIKE THE VERY FIEND
HIS EXCELLENCY ENTERED AT ONCE INTO CONVERSATION RAISING SEVERAL INTERESTING TOPICS UPON WHICH I GAVE MY VIEWS SO MUCH TO HIS ENTERTAINMENT THAT HE SHOWED MORE CHEERFULNESS THAN I HAD EVER SEEN IN HIM BEFORE
I TURNED AT ONCE TO THE CHURCH OF THE ANNUNZIATA AND WHEN I EXPLAINED THE TERMS ON WHICH I HAD SOUGHT TO MAKE A PRESENT OF IT TO S
1 AT THE END OF TWO YEARS SHE WAS ONCE MORE WITH CHILD
NEVER THINK OF THAT BENVENUTO! I REPLIED
BUT TAKE CARE YOU NEVER SHOW YOURSELF AGAIN IN MY INN OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU. OUR HOST THEN CAME UP TO ME AND WHEN I BEGAN TO MAKE HIM MY EXCUSES HE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO SAY A WORD BUT TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW I WAS ENTIRELY IN THE RIGHT AND BADE ME BE UPON MY GUARD AGAINST THOSE MEN UPON MY JOURNEY
I HAD JUST NINETEEN YEARS THEN AND SO HAD THE CENTURY
LET THEM BE ALSO GIVEN TO BENVENUTO MON AMI AND TAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOUSE AND LET HIM HAVE THEM WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF ANY FEES. THOSE OF THE GREAT STROZZI 1 COST HIM SEVERAL HUNDRED DUCATS
WELL THIS MESSER ALONSO ARRIVED AND MESSER ALBERTO SAID TO HIM
THIS WAS CONTRARY TO MY INTENTION FOR I HAD QUITE RESOLVED TO SET OUT
TURNED ASIDE NOT FRONTING THE SPECTATOR
THOSE GOOD AND COURTEOUS GENTLEMEN REPORTED THIS TO THE DUKE WHO WAS MIGHTILY ENRAGED
ALTHOUGH I PROMISED TO OBEY HIM HE REFLECTED LIKE A MAN OF SENSE THAT IF SIGNOR ORAZIO CAME TO FLORENCE I COULD NOT WITHDRAW MYSELF FROM MILITARY SERVICE PARTLY BECAUSE I HAD PASSED MY WORD AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS
ALESSANDRO WAS MURDERED BY HIS COUSIN LORENZINO AT FLORENCE ON THE 5TH OF JANUARY 1537
THEN I CALLED THE MAID BEATRICE A PISTOJAN GIRL AND ASKED HER TO BRING ME A GREAT CRYSTAL WATER-COOLER WHICH STOOD NEAR FULL OF CLEAR AND FRESH WATER
IN THAT CONDITION I ABODE UNTIL THE NINETEENTH HOUR OF THE FOLLOWING DAY
I WAS INFURIATED TO SUCH A PITCH THAT I DASHED MY TOOLS ACROSS THE ROOM AND ALL THE THINGS I WAS AT WORK ON MADE MY ARRANGEMENTS TO QUIT FRANCE AND WENT UPON THE SPOT TO FIND THE KING
DURING THE NIGHT HE LAY BENEATH MY BED AND I HAD TO CALL OUT AT LEAST THREE TIMES TO MY SERVANT TO TURN HIM OUT BECAUSE HE HOWLED SO FEARFULLY
THEY WERE ALL MEN DEVOTED TO ARMS AND OF NOTABLE BRAVERY
THOSE I LEFT BEHIND IN ORDER THAT THE TWO YOUNG MEN MIGHT NOT BE IDLE
THEREFORE I STOOD UPON MY HONOUR AND WROTE IN TERMS OF HAUGHTY COLDNESS WHICH WAS PRECISELY WHAT THOSE TWO TRAITORS MY APPRENTICES MOST HEARTILY DESIRED
AND AT ALL HOURS SOMETIMES IN PRAYER AND SOMETIMES IN COMMUNION WITH GOD I ABODE IN THOSE HIGH THOUGHTS OF HIM
I CARVED ON IT A KNOT OF LEAVES IN THE ANTIQUE STYLE WITH FIGURES OF CHILDREN AND OTHER MASKS OF GREAT BEAUTY
I THEN BEGAN MY SPEECH TO THIS EFFECT
SO THEN I LABOURED SEVERAL WEEKS AT THE BASON ORDERED BY CARDINAL FERRARA BUT THE IRKSOMENESS OF MY IMPRISONMENT BRED IN ME A DISGUST FOR SUCH EMPLOYMENT AND I TOOK TO MODELLING IN WAX SOME LITTLE FIGURES OF MY FANCY FOR MERE RECREATION
BUT THE ROOM WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR STATUES OR FOR PAINTINGS SINCE THE WINDOWS WERE TOO LOW SO THAT THE LIGHT COMING FROM BENEATH SPOILED THE EFFECT THEY WOULD HAVE PRODUCED UNDER MORE FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS
THEN I WAITED FOR THE CARDINAL
5 SO AT LAST PERCEIVING THAT I DID NOT MEAN TO COME TO HIM HE MADE MESSER RUBERTO BID ME BRING MY WORK THAT HE MIGHT SEE HOW I WAS GETTING ON
AT LAST I RESOLVED TO DO IT AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE AND TO SPEND THE REQUISITE TIME UPON IT
PAUL SURROUNDED WITH THIS INSCRIPTION
ASCANIO ANSWERED THAT PAGOLO WAS WOUNDED TO THE DEATH
V
AND THE DYKE ITSELF WAS COVERED WITH WATER SO THAT THE RECKLESS FELLOW SLIPPED AND FELL TOGETHER WITH HIS HORSE BENEATH THE WATER
OBSERVING THE PRINCES TO BE SO WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS ME I BEGGED LEAVE FROM THE DUKE TO GO TO ROME
AND THOUGH I GAINED MORE THUS THAN IN ANY OTHER WAY YET I WAS DISSATISFIED FOR I WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED UPON SOME HIGHER TASK THAN THAT OF SETTING PRECIOUS STONES
NOT LESS WAS THE DISCOMFORT OF THE MEN APPOINTED TO DISCHARGE THE EVIL BUSINESS OF MY EXECUTION
1 THIS LED TO MY TAKING HIS PORTRAIT
1 JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD GOT SO FAR THAT NOBODY COULD FIND ME I HEARD HORSES GALLOPING AFTER
WHEN I CHASTISE YOU I SHALL NOT HEED MY OWN LIFE FOR I AM CERTAIN TO TAKE YOURS
BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS FATHER FOR YOUR SAKE I WILL TAKE HIM BACK. NOTE 1
AT THE SAME MOMENT I APPROACHED THE DUKE AND ALMOST WEEPING FOR GLADNESS KISSED HIS ROBE
XLI IN THE MEANTIME I BROUGHT MY SILVER JUPITER TO COMPLETION TOGETHER WITH ITS GILDED PEDESTAL WHICH I PLACED UPON A WOODEN PLINTH THAT ONLY SHOWED A VERY LITTLE
THEN THEY GAVE ME ALL THE GOLD WHICH WEIGHED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AND BADE ME MELT IT DOWN AS SECRETLY AS I WAS ABLE
IN PISA ALSO THERE ARE SOME AND I HAVE DISCOVERED THEM IN MANY PARTS OF CHRISTENDOM
BUT TO RETURN TO MESSER GUIDO
THE REST I KEPT FOR MY OWN USE LIVING UPON IT WHILE I WENT ABOUT STUDYING THE ANTIQUITIES OF ROME UNTIL MY MONEY FAILED AND I HAD TO RETURN TO THE SHOP FOR WORK
THEN I WENT TO THE NOTARIES WHO HAD PUT THE FELLOW IN POSSESSION
IT SO HAPPENED THAT A GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED A FEW YEARS EARLIER MADE HIM THINK THIS PIECE MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE APPEARED TO ANY OTHER MAN
3 I MET HOWEVER WITH CONSIDERABLE DELAYS OWING AS I DID NOT THEN KNOW TO THE STRENUOUS EXERTIONS ROSSO MADE AGAINST MY ADMISSION TO HIS MAJESTY
THEN I CARRIED MY BROTHER HOME FOR DEAD AND IT WAS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT HE CAME TO HIMSELF AGAIN
THIS MADE ME CALL OUT TO MY FELICE TO DRAW NEAR AND CHASE THAT MALIGNANT OLD MAN AWAY
I ONLY GAVE TWO BLOWS FOR HE FELL STONE DEAD AT THE SECOND
AT ROME
MY MASTER WHO TOOK PLEASURE IN COMING TO VISIT ME IN THE LITTLE ROOM WHICH HE HAD ALLOTTED ME OBSERVING THAT I SPENT ALL MY TIME IN STUDIOUS OCCUPATIONS BEGAN TO LOVE ME LIKE A FATHER
INDEED IT WAS POINTED TOO HIGH
IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE POOR GIRL WAS ATTACKED BY A DISORDER IN HER RIGHT HAND WHICH ATE INTO THE TWO BONES BELONGING TO THE LITTLE FINGER AND THE NEXT
THE DUCHESS HOWEVER AFTER A FEW DAYS DEPRIVED ME OF THIS MEANS OF ACCESS BY HAVING ALL THE DOORS UPON THE PATH I HAD TO TRAVERSE LOCKED UP
WHEREFORE I THOUGHT THAT I HAD MADE A VERY GOOD BARGAIN WHEN THEY PLACED ME IN THAT HIDEOUS DUNGEON I HAVE SPOKEN OF WHERE FRA FOIANO DIED OF HUNGER AND LEFT ME THERE WITHOUT DOING ME FURTHER INJURY
WHEN I REACHED THE HOUSE I FOUND THE BOY IN GOOD HEALTH AND KISSED HIM VERY SAD AT HEART
AND YET SO FAR AS SHE WAS ABLE SHE TOOK GOOD CARE I SHOULD NOT SEE THEM
WELL THEN THIS VIRTUOUS SCHOOL SAYS THAT IF ONE WERE TO SHAVE THE HAIR OF YOUR HERCULES THERE WOULD NOT BE SKULL ENOUGH LEFT TO HOLD HIS BRAIN
I PUSHED MY WAY IN AND CALLED BOLDLY FOR THE JUDGE WHO WAS SEATED BLOWN OUT BIG AND FAT UPON A TRIBUNAL HIGH ABOVE THE REST
WHILE I IN DESPAIR POOR WRETCHED I WAS CALLING UP REMEMBRANCE OF THE NOBLE STATE I HELD IN FRANCE TO THE GREAT SORROW OF MY SOUL
I OPENED FIRE WITH MY OTHER PIECE DOING THEM GREAT HURT
BORN 1523
TO HIM I MADE BUT ONE REQUEST AND THIS I URGED MOST EARNESTLY NAMELY THAT HE WOULD BRING ME WHERE I COULD BEHOLD THE SUN
BUT BEFORE I HAD THE TIME TO CATCH HIM UP SECOND THOUGHTS AROSE WHICH MADE ME THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO DRIVE THEM BOTH AWAY TOGETHER
BUT MY EXPLOITS UP TO THIS POINT HAD BEEN TOO MARVELLOUS FOR A HUMAN BEING AND GOD WAS UNWILLING TO ENCOURAGE MY VAINGLORY
NOW ONE EVENING I HAPPENED TO ARRIVE RATHER LATER THAN USUAL WHEREUPON HE SAID
LA PALICE
YOU MUST KNOW GENTLE READERS THAT THOUGH I PUT ON THIS APPEARANCE OF PLEASANTRY MY HEART WAS BURSTING IN MY BODY TO THINK THAT A FELLOW THE FOULEST VILLAIN WHO EVER BREATHED SHOULD HAVE DARED IN THE PRESENCE OF SO GREAT A PRINCE TO CAST AN INSULT OF THAT ATROCIOUS NATURE IN MY TEETH
IN THE MEANWHILE THAT INFERNAL PLOT HAD COME TO A HEAD AND BROKEN FOR I HAD WRITTEN TO MY GREAT MASTER THE DUKE GIVING HIM A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE CAUSES OF MY ESCAPADE TO VENICE
E HE WAS IN THE CARDINALS REGULAR PAY
AND FOR TWO YEARS OR THEREABOUTS WE LIVED IN INTIMACY
WHEN I FELT IT QUITE ACCLIMATISED I RESOLVED TO PUT UP WITH ALL THOSE INDESCRIBABLE DISCOMFORTS SO LONG AS IT HELD OUT
HE DID THE ROUGH WORK OF POLICING THE CITY AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY A MARK FOR ALL THE MEN OF SPIRIT WHO DISLIKED BEING KEPT IN ORDER
NO SOONER DID IT DAWN THAN I ORDERED OUT THE HORSES MADE MY PREPARATIONS IN A MOMENT AND GAVE THE TWO YOUNG MEN EVERYTHING WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME AND FIFTY DUCATS OF GOLD IN ADDITION
AND THIS THEY COULD WELL DO FOR I HAD ORDERED THEM TO KEEP ALL NIGHT A LAMP ALIGHT THERE
ANOTHER EVENING AFTER I HAD FINISHED THE SMALL BRONZE FIGURES WHICH ARE WROUGHT INTO THE PEDESTAL OF PERSEUS THAT IS TO SAY THE JUPITER MERCURY MINERVA AND DANæ WITH THE LITTLE PERSEUS SEATED AT HIS MOTHERS FEET I HAD THEM CARRIED INTO THE ROOM WHERE I WAS WONT TO WORK AND ARRANGED THEM IN A ROW RAISED SOMEWHAT ABOVE THE LINE OF VISION SO THAT THEY PRODUCED A MAGNIFICENT EFFECT
WE WILL REMAIN SOME LITTLE WHILE IF ONLY BY GREAT GOD YOU PROMISED ARE SUCH GRACE THAT NO WORSE WOES ON US BE SET
HE GAVE THIS ADVICE THE MORE SECURELY BECAUSE THE SOLDIERS HAD NOW ARRIVED WHO INTERRUPTED THE COMPLETION OF MY DEED
3 AND MY OTHER ENEMIES WITH MESSER TRAIANO AT THE HEAD OF THEM PROMISED THE FELLOW A REWARD OF ONE HUNDRED CROWNS
ANOTHER ROMAN HAD ALSO COME ON PURPOSE TO ENTER MY SERVICE
FOR WHEN NIGHT CAME I SET FIRE TO THE TORCH WHICH STANDING HIGHER THAN THE HEAD OF JUPITER SHED LIGHT FROM ABOVE AND SHOWED THE STATUE FAR BETTER THAN BY DAYTIME
I HAD NEARLY FINISHED THE TWO BASTIONS WHEN AN INROAD OF PIERO STROZZIS PEOPLE STRUCK SUCH TERROR INTO THE COUNTRYFOLK OF PRATO THAT THEY BEGAN TO LEAVE IT IN A BODY AND ALL THEIR CARTS LADEN WITH THE HOUSEHOLD GOODS OF EACH FAMILY CAME CROWDING INTO THE CITY
AS THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT AND AS I WISHED TO PROVE THAT I HAD SPOKEN TRUTH I WAS OBLIGED TO BRING EVIDENCE AND TO MAKE NEW DRAWINGS OF THE VASES
ALL THOSE SOLDIERS AND OTHERS WHO HAD TO DO WITH THE SAID CAPTAIN USED THEN TO SAY
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SIENA TASSO SAID FOR HE HAD HURT HIS FEET THAT HE WOULD NOT GO FARTHER AND ASKED ME TO LEND HIM MONEY TO GET BACK
THESE INGENIOUS ARGUMENTS AND THE WEIGHTY INFLUENCE OF MADAME DETAMPES PREVAILED WITH THE KING
THAT I NEVER RECKONED UPON ANY GAIN BEYOND SOME SMALL REMUNERATION FROM POPE PAOLO WHICH HE HAD PROMISED ME
IN LIKE MEASURE YOU SOLDIER DRUGGIST PEASANT FROM PRATO ARE BOUND TO TASTE THE MEAT FOR A FLORENTINE OF MY STATION. HE RETORTED WITH COARSE WORDS WHICH I WAS NOT SLOW TO PAY BACK IN KIND
YOU HAVE NO SEAT TO SIT ON SAVE THE STOOL
BUT INASMUCH AS I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT YOU ARE WRONG TO ABUSE ME IN THIS WAY ESPECIALLY AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT I AM NOT THE MAN TO PUT UP WITH INSULTS. HE RETORTED THAT I KNEW EVERYTHING AND THAT HE WAS THE MAN TO MAKE ME BEAR A HEAVIER LOAD THAN THAT AND THAT FELICE AND I WERE TWO GREAT RASCALS
I DINED WELL AND AFTERWARDS REMAINED WITHOUT SEEING OR HEARING ANY ONE UNTIL AN HOUR AFTER NIGHTFALL
HE BEGAN BY SAYING THAT THE SOLE REASON WHY HE COULD NOT GO FORWARD REGULARLY WITH THESE PAYMENTS WAS THE SCARCITY OF MONEY AT THE PALACE
OH IF THAT DEVIL BENVENUTO ONLY SAW US SHOULDNT WE JUST CATCH IT! SHE ANSWERED
BEING SOMEWHAT SAVAGE IN HER WAYS AND SPARE OF SPEECH QUICK IN MOVEMENT WITH A LOOK OF SULLENNESS ABOUT HER EYES I NICKNAMED HER SCORZONE
UPON THIS HE SAID TO ME
BUT OTHERWISE IT WAS BUT REASON THAT HE SHOULD SET ME AT LIBERTY
TO THESE WORDS THE POPE RESPONDED
FOR I WILL UNDERTAKE TO GATHER UP THE FALLEN THREAD AND HAVE THE PROMISED MONEY GIVEN YOU BY THIS MAGNANIMOUS KING. NOW LET THE WORLD TAKE NOTICE AND ALL THE FOLK THAT DWELL ON IT WHAT POWER MALIGNANT STARS WITH ADVERSE FORTUNE EXERCISE UPON US HUMAN BEINGS
ASCANIO SFORZA SON OF BOSIO COUNT OF SANTA FIORE AND GRANDSON OF PAUL III
IF I WERE TO LEAVE PARIS YOU WOULD VANISH THE NEXT DAY IN SMOKE
I DO NOT INDEED STAND IN NEED OF THIS FOR I HAVE ALREADY MADE MY HEARTS CONFESSION TO MY LORD GOD
ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION WE REACHED OUR HOMES AND EACH ONE OF US DREAMED ALL THAT NIGHT OF DEVILS
1 I WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
AND GREAT WAS MY LONGING TO REACH ITALY BEING DESIROUS TO DIE THERE RATHER THAN IN FRANCE
MESSER CHERUBINO WORE THE HABIT OF A PRIEST
AWAY WITH YOU OLD RASCAL AND DONT BOTHER OUR FRIEND BENVENUTO. WHEN I SAW THAT THEY WERE MAKING FUN OF ME I TURNED TO MESSER GADDI AND SAID
IF HE NOW WANTED ME TO DO THE CONTRARY I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO SUBMIT
NOW ABOUT THAT TIME THE QUEEN OF FRANCE SENT MESSER BACCIO DEL BENE TO OUR DUKE FOR A LOAN OF MONEY WHICH THE DUKE VERY GRACIOUSLY SUPPLIED AS RUMOUR WENT
I THEN BEGAN FROM THE BEGINNING AND USED SUCH CONVINCING ARGUMENTS THAT HE SAW AT LAST HOW THE MATTER REALLY STOOD SINCE I MADE IT EVIDENT THAT HE WOULD ONLY BE THROWING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AWAY
I STURDILY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THEM
WHEN THE KING ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF THE CASTLE AND HEARD OUR HAMMERS GOING HE BADE HIS COMPANY KEEP SILENCE
2 ON ARRIVING AT THIS PLACE I FOUND THAT THE KING WAS INDISPOSED
MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE. THIS I PROMISED TO DO AND THEN ASKED HIM WHETHER IT WOULD BE SAFE FOR ME TO TRAVEL SO FAR AS TO FLORENCE
THE FIRST THING THIS MAN DID WAS TO COME TO ME AND HAVING GREETED ME WITH THE UTMOST KINDNESS HE STATIONED ME WITH FIVE FINE PIECES OF ARTILLERY ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE CASTLE TO WHICH THE NAME OF THE ANGEL SPECIALLY BELONGS
THIS IS THE FAMOUS PALAZZO DEL TE OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF MANTUA
WHEN I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN THERE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT HE TOOK IT VERY ILL AND SAID THAT I SHOWED LITTLE ESTEEM FOR A POPE WHO HAD URGENTLY COMPELLED HIM TO WRITE THREE TIMES FOR ME
HIS WHEEDLING WORDS AND WAYS INDUCED ME TO SET OFF IN A BAD HOUR FOR MY WELFARE ON A VISIT TO HIM
HE WAS A DEADLY FOE OF MINE AND WAS THE MAN WHO HAD ADMINISTERED THE POWDERED DIAMOND
I TOLD THEM THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE LET MYSELF BE MOVED ON HER ACCOUNT BUT THAT I WAS BENT ON PUNISHING THE INFAMOUS YOUNG MAN WHO SHOWED HOW LITTLE HE REGARDED ME
THEN HE AND THE DUCHESS PUT QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE WORKS WHICH I HAD EXECUTED FOR THE KING
SEEING THE FELLOW IN SUCH A MISERABLE PLIGHT HE ASKED WHO HAD STRUCK HIM
FOR LESS THAN TWO FARTHINGS I WILL THROW PERSEUS TO THE DOGS AND SO OUR DIFFERENCES WILL BE ENDED. THIS THEN MADE ME ANXIOUS AND INDUCED ME TO ENTRUST GIROLAMO DEGLI ALBIZZI WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS TELLING HIM ANYTHING WOULD SATISFY ME PROVIDED I RETAINED THE GOOD GRACES OF THE DUKE
FOR IF BY BLOWING OUT HIS CHEEKS OR SINGING LA BELLA FRANCES-CHINA 2 HE COULD BRING THE DUKE TO MAKE THAT PURCHASE THEN HE GAINED THE GOOD GRACE OF THE DUCHESS AND TO BOOT HIS OWN COMMISSION WHICH ROSE TO SOME HUNDREDS OF CROWNS
UPON THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY THEREFORE SINCE THIS NAME STRUCK JULIUS CæSAR AS BEING FAIR AND APT AND GIVEN BY CIRCUMSTANCE AND SEEING FURTHERMORE THAT FLOWERS THEMSELVES BRING GOOD AUGURY HE APPOINTED THE NAME OF FLORENCE FOR THE TOWN
2 I WAS RIDING A CROSS-BOW SHOT BEFORE MY COMRADES
AND I BECOMING PARTLY AWARE OF HIS INTENTIONS WAS VERY WILLING
1 I BEGGED THEM FOR MERCYS SAKE TO HOLD THEIR PEACE
SO THE GUIDE RAN OFF TO BRING THE FOLK TOGETHER AND CAME FOLLOWED BY A CROWD WITH A BOAR-SPEAR IN HIS HAND
BUONARROTI USED TO SAY THAT HE MADE IT LOOK LIKE A CAGE FOR CRICKETS
WE REMAINED SOME WHILE DISPUTING THE MATTER WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WOULD GO TO THE DUKE AND GET AN ORDER FROM HIS EXCELLENCY TO HAVE IT SHOWN HIM
3 LORD GIOVANBATISTA AFTER VERY KINDLY ENTERTAINING ME TWO DAYS ADVISED ME TO REMOVE AND GO TOWARD NAPLES TILL THE STORM BLEW OVER
2 IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE GAVE THE POPE A DIAMOND WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FOR TWELVE THOUSAND CROWNS
AND WHEN I HAD TO GET OUT OF BED TO OBEY A CALL OF NATURE I CRAWLED ON ALL FOURS WITH EXTREME DISTRESS IN ORDER NOT TO FOUL THE PLACE I SLEPT IN
HE STIPULATED THAT NO WORDS SHOULD BE BANDIED ABOUT ON EITHER SIDE SEEING THAT WOULD BE LITTLE TO THEIR CREDIT
AT THAT TIME I FASHIONED A SILVER BAS-RELIEF OF THE SIZE OF A LITTLE CHILDS HAND
FOR THE MEDICI WERE IN EXILE THAT IS TO SAY SIGNOR IPPOLITO AND SIGNOR ALESSANDRO WHO WERE AFTERWARDS RESPECTIVELY CARDINAL AND DUKE OF FLORENCE
CXII SO THE GOVERNOR CAME TO SEE ME
THESE ARE FIRST THE COLOSSAL BRONZE BUST OF YOUR EXCELLENCY WHICH IS NOW IN ELBA
THE KING REPLIED THAT HE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED IF ONLY SAINT PAUL WOULD EXPLAIN THE WAY IN WHICH HE MEANT TO MANAGE ME
I WILL KILL YOU ALL! BUT I TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO DO THEM ANY HARM AS I MIGHT TOO EASILY HAVE DONE
WHEN I FELT MY HAND GO IN AND HEARD THE CLOTHES TEAR I THOUGHT THAT I HAD KILLED HIM
XXVI SINCE I AM WRITING MY LIFE I MUST FROM TIME TO TIME DIVERGE FROM MY PROFESSION IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE WITH BREVITY IF NOT IN DETAIL SOME INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE NO BEARING ON MY CAREER AS ARTIST
JOINING TOGETHER THE PALMS OF HIS OLD HANDS HE RAISED THEM WITH HIS EYES TO GOD AND SAID LORD I THANK THEE WITH MY WHOLE HEART
ALL THIS CHATTERING GREW IRKSOME TO ME
BUT MEANWHILE SPEAK TO BENVENUTO AND LET HIM ALSO MAKE A MODEL
MESSER ANTONIO SANTACROCE HAD MADE ME COME DOWN FROM THE ANGEL IN ORDER TO FIRE ON SOME HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE CERTAIN OF OUR BESIEGERS HAD BEEN SEEN TO ENTER
WE MUST CONTRIVE TO KEEP HIM WITH US
FOR IF IT IS ONE OF MY MEN I WILL HANG HIM FROM THE BATTLEMENT WHENCE BENVENUTO LEAPED. ON HIS DEPARTURE THE POPE CALLED THE GOVERNOR AND SAID SMILING
ON HEARING THIS THE POPE TURNED TO ONE OF HIS CONFIDENTIAL SERVANTS AND SAID
I SHALL BE ABLE TO MAKE GOOD MY REPUTATION
THE MAN TOOK TO HIS HEELS
SEE J
1 THEY WERE TAKING TO PRISON A CERTAIN CAPTAIN CISTI A LOMBARD WHO HAD ALSO BEEN A MEMBER OF GIOVANNIS TROOP BUT WAS NOT IN THE SERVICE OF THE DUKE
SEE THAT YOU DISPATCH IT AT ONCE FOR THIS IS MY PLEASURE
STANDING AT HIS DOOR HE CALLED TO ME AND SAID
BUT THE WOODEN PANEL ITSELF AND THE BOLT TOO OFFERED SUCH RESISTANCE THAT I COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR
THE PLACE WAS BARRED WITH THICK IRON BOLTS OUTSIDE
MUCH MORE COMPLETE IS THE VIEW HE GIVES OF THE ARTISTIC LIFE OF THE TIME
THEREUPON THE SURLY FELLOW BEGAN TO ABUSE ME AND I GAVE IT HIM BACK AGAIN
YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU HAVE GOT AND YOU ARE NOW THE CAUSE OF SENDING ME BACK TO DIE HERE TOO. WHILE I WAS UTTERING THESE WORDS I KEPT RIDING BRISKLY ONWARD
I DONT INTEND TO BEG YOU OF YOURSELF
1 KNOWING HIM TO BE MY FRIEND I THRUST MY HEAD OUT OF THE HOLE IN MY CELL AND CALLED HIM WITH A LOUD VOICE CRYING THAT THOSE THIEVES HAD GIVEN ME A POUNDED DIAMOND WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING ME
BY MY GREAT LABOURS I MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO HIS MAJESTY WHO APPROVED OF MY MODELS AND GAVE THE WORK INTO MY HANDS
CELLINIS USE OF THE WORD ARTE FOR THE ART OR TRADE OF GOLDSMITHS CORRESPONDS TO THE ART AS USED BY ENGLISH WRITERS EARLY IN THIS CENTURY
ILL LUCK TO THOSE WHO SEEK TO FILL THEIR POCKETS BY THE DOWRY OF THEIR WIFE
IN THAT WHILE THE FLOWER OF OUR NATION AMONG THE MERCHANTS CAME TO VISIT ME IMPLORING ME NOT TO PERSIST IN CONTENDING WITH A POPE FOR THIS MIGHT BE THE RUIN OF ME
AFTER ENTERING THE PRESENCE I PUT MY MEDALS TOGETHER WITH THE DIES OF STEEL INTO HIS HAND
MEANWHILE THE GOVERNOR AND THE FISCAL WERE AT ME PARTLY BULLYING PARTLY EXPOSTULATING PARTLY GIVING ADVICE AND SAYING IT WAS ONLY REASON THAT A MAN WHO ORDERED WORK FROM ANOTHER SHOULD BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW IT AT HIS CHOICE AND IN ANY WAY WHICH HE THOUGHT BEST
XXXII TO THIS SPEECH BOLOGNA ANSWERED
CONSEQUENTLY THEY DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO PREVENT MY COMING BACK
BUT PROTESTING THAT IF THROUGH GODS GRACE I CAME OUT FROM THE PRISON HE MEANT NEVER TO ABANDON ME
THIS GATTA PUT IN ORDER FOR ME THE BOOKS IN WHICH I WROTE THE ACCOUNTS OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY AND MY OTHER EMPLOYERS
THIS WAS A FIGURE AS I HAVE SAID CHISELLED ON A PLATE OF GOLD
COME FATHER AND SEE BENVENUTO
ACCORDINGLY BENVENUTO SINCE FORTUNE HAS SAVED US FROM THIS FIRST TEMPEST DO NOT TEMPT HER AGAIN FOR THINGS MAY NOT GO SO FAVOURABLY A SECOND TIME. TO THIS I REPLIED
TO WHOM I SAID I WAS A GOLDSMITH
OCTOBER 28 1560
I SHALL NOT HOWEVER UTTER MY OWN SENTIMENTS BUT SHALL RECAPITULATE WHAT OUR MOST VIRTUOUS SCHOOL OF FLORENCE SAYS ABOUT IT. THE BRUTAL FELLOW KEPT MAKING DISAGREEABLE REMARKS AND GESTICULATING WITH HIS HANDS AND FEET UNTIL HE ENRAGED ME SO THAT I BEGAN AGAIN AND SPOKE FAR MORE RUDELY THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE IF HE HAD BEHAVED WITH DECENCY
IT IS WORTHY OF NOTICE THAT FROM THIS POINT ONWARD THE MS
MESSER FRANCESCO IF YOU WILL NOT TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHICH IS JUST AND REASONABLE I WILL SHOW YOU ANOTHER WHICH SHALL BE LIKE YOUR OWN THAT IS TO SAY UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE
AT LENGTH WHEN ALL THE WAX WAS GONE AND THE MOULD WAS WELL BAKED I SET TO WORK AT DIGGING THE PIT IN WHICH TO SINK IT
MY DEAR BENVENUTO WHAT HAVE YOU COME TO DO HERE
ON HEARING THE COMMOTION ONE OF THE OLD MANS SONS THE ELDER ROSE FROM TABLE TO GO AND LOOK AT THE SCUFFLE
THE INSCRIPTION RAN THUS FRANCISCO CELLINO FLORENTINO QUI QUOD IN TENERIS ANNIS AD IOANNEM MEDICEM DUCEM PLURES VICTORIAS RETULIT ET SIGNIFER FUIT FACILE DOCUMENTUM DEDIT QUANTæ FORTITUDINIS ET CONSILII VIR FUTURUS ERAT NI CRUDELIS FATI ARCHIBUSO TRANSFOSSUS QUINTO æTATIS LUSTRO JACERET BENVENUTUS FRATER POSUIT
MINE WERE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE DURABLE THAN THE TURKISH AND THIS FOR DIVERS REASONS
INDEED HE LOOKED JUST LIKE A BEAR
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HERE? BANDINELLO WITHOUT ANSWERING CAST A GLANCE UPON THE BOX WHERE THE STATUE LAY UNCOVERED
I ONLY ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE SARCOPHAGUS UPON THE GROUND BENEATH THE FEET OF CHRIST INTO WHICH I MIGHT CREEP WHEN I WAS DEAD
AND SO I DID
MY NEW MASTER THEN PUT IN WITH HIS EXCUSES SAYING THAT HE HAD NOT ASKED ME TO COME AND THAT I SHOULD GRATIFY HIM BY RETURNING WITH FIRENZUOLA
THE DUKE IS TALKING AND LAUGHING WITH BENVENUTO AND IS IN EXCELLENT GOOD-HUMOUR. WHEN THE DUCHESS HEARD THIS SHE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO THE WARDROBE AND NOT FINDING THE DUKE THERE TOOK A SEAT BESIDE US
I ALSO BEGAN TO CAST THE PEDESTAL FOR JUPITER WHICH I WROUGHT VERY RICHLY IN BRONZE COVERED WITH ORNAMENTS AMONG WHICH WAS A BAS-RELIEF REPRESENTING THE RAPE OF GANYMEDE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE LEDA AND THE SWAN
I RAN UP AT ONCE SEIZED HIS SWORD AND STOOD IN FRONT OF HIM BEARING THE BRUNT OF SEVERAL RAPIERS AND A SHOWER OF STONES
THE REST WAS GIVEN ME FOR THE COVER OF THE BOOK WHICH HOWEVER WAS WORTH MORE THAN A THOUSAND BEING ENRICHED WITH MULTITUDES OF FIGURES ARABESQUES ENAMELLINGS AND JEWELS
ON THIS OUR ORDERS WERE COUNTERMANDED
BUT THIS IS PROBABLY A MISTAKE OF THE AMANUENSIS
THE ITALIAN IS BRACCIAIUOLA A PIT BELOW THE GRATING WHICH RECEIVES THE ASHES FROM THE FURNACE
MESSER BARTOLOMMEO MUST HAVE REPORTED MY AUDACIOUS SPEECHES TO THE POPE AND MORE PERHAPS THAN I HAD REALLY SAID
THE SORCERER TURNED TO ME AND SAID
BUT BE OF GOOD CHEER
UPON HEARING THESE TRUCULENT WORDS AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF SIENA JOINED US
NOR THIS ALONE BUT EVERYTHING WHICH YOU MAY HAVE IT IN YOUR MIND TO EXECUTE SO LONG AS LIFE IS LEFT ME WILL I PERFORM AT YOUR SERVICE. THERETO THE EMPEROR RESPONDED
I AM INDEED LUCKY TO HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SEE IT! 2 MESSER ALFONSO QUITE AFFRONTED LET SOME CONTEMPTUOUS WORDS ESCAPE HIM AND EXCLAIMED
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS ENTIRELY IN THE RIGHT AND WOULD NOT BEND SUBMISSIVELY BECAUSE I JUDGED THAT IF I WROTE IN HUMBLE TERMS THOSE ENEMIES OF MINE WOULD SAY IN THEIR FRENCH FASHION THAT I HAD CONFESSED MYSELF TO BLAME AND THAT CERTAIN MISDOINGS WITH WHICH THEY WRONGFULLY TAXED ME WERE PROVED TRUE
THE CANALI OR CHANNELS WERE SLUICES FOR CARRYING THE MOLTEN METAL FROM THE FURNACE INTO THE MOULD
WHEREFORE I MUST NOW TURN BACK A BIT TO GATHER UP THE THREAD OF MY NARRATION
WORSE WOE COULD SCARCELY GRIND SPIRITS IN HELL DEBARRED FROM PARADISE
WHEREUPON HE SAID
AND AFTER THEY HAD BEEN WELL ENGRAVED AND INLAID WITH GOLD THEY PRODUCED A VERY BEAUTIFUL EFFECT
FOR ANDREA SAID TO STEFANO
WHEN I HEARD AND SAW THAT NO ONE BUT A POOR SERVANT-GIRL CALLED CANIDA WAS IN THE HOUSE I WENT TO PUT AWAY MY CLOAK AND THE SCABBARD OF MY SWORD AND THEN RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHICH STOOD BEHIND THE BANCHI ON THE RIVER TIBER
I WENT TO GIVE HER THAT FINE PIECE OF SILVER-GILT PLATE AND TOOK PAINS THAT SHE WOULD BE INFORMED OF MY INTENTION
UNHAPPY PIECE OF STONE
THIS IS THE FAMOUS GIACOPO TATTI WHO TOOK HIS ARTISTS SURNAME FROM HIS MASTER ANDREA DA MONTE A SANSOVINO
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING HANDSOMER? I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NOT NOTICED IT
LITTLE BEGINNINGS SOMETIMES HAVE GREAT ENDINGS; AND I FOSTERED HOPE IN MY HEART BY NOTICING HOW MANY THOUSAND DUCATS HAD RECENTLY BEEN SQUANDERED UPON UGLY PIECES OF BAD SCULPTURE TURNED OUT BY THAT BEAST OF A BUACCIO BANDINELLI
COSIMOS SILVER MINES WERE AT CAMPIGLIA AND PIETRASANTRA
ONE DAY HE SENT FOR ME AND DURING OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MODELS I GAVE MANY REASONS WHY THE OCTAGONAL PULPIT WOULD BE FAR MORE CONVENIENT FOR ITS DESTINED USES AND WOULD PRODUCE A MUCH FINER EFFECT
POSSIBLY BERNARDINO LILII OF TODI
BUT SINCE THEY FORM NO PART OF MY DESIGN I PASS THEM BRIEFLY OVER
E PRIVATE AND SENTIMENTAL
THIS OFFICIAL IN A CONVENT WAS THE SAME AS CELLARER OR SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CELLAR AND PROVISIONS
I HAD BEEN SHOWN THEM IN PASSING AND NOW THEY MADE MONSTROUS HASTE TO CATCH ME UP
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS FOLLOWING WE WENT ON WORKING MERRILY AND GOT THE JUG AND BASIN FORWARD
WHEN YOUR MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP LEFT ME IN FERRARA YOU GAVE ME A PROMISE WHICH I HAD NEVER ASKED FOR NOT TO BRING ME OUT OF ITALY BEFORE I CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS ON WHICH I SHOULD BE PLACED HERE WITH HIS MAJESTY
FOR I TOOK THE BEST I COULD FIND AND CHANGED THEM OFTEN RETAINING ONLY THOSE WHO KNEW THEIR BUSINESS WELL
A FLORENTINE EXILE MENTIONED BY VARCHI
NOW JUST CONSIDER WHAT A JUDICIOUS DOCTOR THIS WAS AFTER I HAD NARRATED AN OCCURRENCE OF THAT GRAVITY TO ASK ME SUCH A QUESTION
WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE ATTACK AND WORRIED ME I DREW MY PONIARD AND WOUNDED ONE OF THEM SO SHARPLY THAT HE HOWLED ALOUD AND ALL THE DOGS ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURE RAN AFTER HIM
THERE CAME INTO MY HANDS AMONG MANY OTHER FRAGMENTS THE HEAD OF A DOLPHIN ABOUT AS BIG AS A GOOD-SIZED BALLOT-BEAN
MON AMI WHICH IS THE SAME AS MY FRIEND I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE PLEASURE BE GREATER FOR THE PRINCE WHO FINDS A MAN AFTER HIS OWN HEART OR FOR THE ARTIST WHO FINDS A PRINCE WILLING TO FURNISH HIM WITH MEANS FOR CARRYING OUT HIS GREAT IDEAS. I ANSWERED THAT IF I WAS REALLY THE MAN HIS MAJESTY DESCRIBED MY GOOD FORTUNE WAS BY FAR THE GREATER
DID I NOT TELL YOU SO? THUS THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER FOR SOME WHILE GREATLY IN MY HONOUR
III MY ANCESTORS DWELT IN VAL D AMBRA WHERE THEY OWNED LARGE ESTATES AND LIVED LIKE LITTLE LORDS IN RETIREMENT HOWEVER ON ACCOUNT OF THE THEN CONTENDING FACTIONS
THERE I FOUND MY SISTER WITH SIX DAUGHTERS THE ELDEST OF WHOM WAS MARRIAGEABLE AND THE YOUNGEST STILL AT NURSE
HE HAD ALREADY HEARD OF ALL OUR ACCIDENTS AND SAID WHEN HE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN FOR THEM
I ANSWERED THAT THERE WAS NO REASON TO KEEP HIM SHUT UP ON MY ACCOUNT
SOMETIMES HE TOOK ME TO THEIR VINEYARD AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE IT STRUCK ME THAT PAULINOS GOOD FATHER WOULD HAVE WELCOMED ME AS A SON-IN-LAW
HE BEGGED ME TO CONSENT TO ENTER HIS WORKSHOP SAYING HE HAD SOME COMMISSIONS OF IMPORTANCE TO EXECUTE ON WHICH HIGH PROFITS MIGHT BE LOOKED FOR
I WILL DESCRIBE WHO THESE ITALIANS WERE
IF THIS WERE WINE AS INDEED TIS WATER I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE GOING GLADLY TO DROWN THEMSELVES IN IT
AND YET THERE ARE MANY FINE THINGS TO BE SEEN AMONG THE LATTER
FOR HIS WORKS ARE COARSE PRETENTIOUS AND INCAPABLE OF GIVING PLEASURE TO ANY PERSON OF REFINED INTELLIGENCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE WHERE IT IS STANDING THAT THE CANNONS BLAST SHOULD BRING IT DOWN
AFTER THAT HE WARNED ME TO TAKE VERY GOOD CARE THAT I WAS NOT MURDERED
FOR THE DRUGGIST OF PRATO EMPLOYED AS A WARDER IN S
BUT THIS ONE ANSWER I WILL MAKE TO ALL YOUR SILLY RAILLERIES
AND YET IN THE MIDST OF ALL HIS TROUBLES I SHOULD LIKE THIS TIME TO SEE HIM LAUGH; AND AS I TOOK MY LEAVE SHE SAID THAT THIS TIME SHE HAD NO WILL TO BESTOW ON HIM THAT FAVOUR
AND WHAT WAS MORE ONE OF THE CORPORALS OF THE GUARD A GENOESE WAS A FRIEND OF THE YOUNG MANS FATHER
WHEN SEVERAL LEGIONS APPEARED AND THE COLISEUM WAS ALL FULL OF DEVILS
HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD ME? I THANKED HIS EXCELLENCY AND THE DUCHESS IN LIKE MANNER WITH THE BEST POLITENESS I COULD USE
THEY HAD THE NAMES YOU MENTIONED BUT WHETHER THEY ARE SICILIANS I CANNOT SAY. I ANSWERED
MOST EXCELLENT LORD IT IS NOW MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS THAT I HAVE EATEN ONLY JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP LIFE TOGETHER
AFTER A FORTNIGHT HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING WITH HIS MASTER THAT IS BANDINELLO WHO TOLD HIM IF I CARED TO MAKE A MARBLE STATUE HE WOULD GIVE ME A FINE BLOCK OF STONE
AND THOSE VALIANT FELLOWS HEARING A SUDDEN COMMOTION IN THE TAVERN THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ARMY COMING OF A HUNDRED MEN
GIVE ME HERE THAT PATENT. HE TOOK IT AND SIGNED IT AT ONCE WITH HIS OWN HAND
ANGELO WOULD SEND UP EVERY EVENING THREE BEACONS FROM ITS SUMMIT ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DISCHARGES OF THE CANNON THRICE REPEATED AND THAT SO LONG AS THIS SIGNAL WAS CONTINUED HE MIGHT TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT THE CASTLE HAD NOT YIELDED
THANK MESSER TRAIANO FROM ME FOR GIVING ME THIS INFORMATION OF A FACT OF WHICH I HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE. THEN HE TURNED AND IN PRESENCE OF THE NOBLEMAN SAID TO THE BISHOP OF FRULLI 2 HIS GENTLEMAN AND INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE
THEY WHEN THEY SAW THEIR FINAL HOPE RETREAT GAVE ME A DIAMOND POUNDED NO FAIR RING DEEMING THAT I MUST DIE IF I SHOULD EAT
GISMONDOS WIFE NOTICING MY FREQUENT PRESENCE IN THAT HOUSE-SHE WAS A LADY AS COURTEOUS AS COULD BE AND OF SURPASSING BEAUTY-CAME UP TO ME ONE DAY LOOKED AT MY DRAWINGS AND ASKED ME IF I WAS A SCULPTOR OR A PAINTER
O GOD
HE ADDED ALSO SOMETHING OF HIS OWN INVENTION
THIS IS NOT A MANS PULSE BUT A LIONS OR A DRAGONS. AT THIS I WHOSE BLOOD WAS THUMPING IN MY VEINS PROBABLY FAR BEYOND ANYTHING WHICH THAT FOOL OF A DOCTOR HAD LEARNED FROM HIS HIPPOCRATES OR GALEN KNEW AT ONCE HOW SERIOUS WAS MY SITUATION
HIS NAME IN FULL WAS JACQUES DE LA FA
I REPLIED AT ONCE
AND GIOVAN BATTISTA SURNAMED IL TASSO THE GATE PINTI
FAREWELL FOR EVER! I ADDED
THAT IS TO SAY VASES OF THE UTMOST BEAUTY BASONS AND SUCH PIECES
NEEDS BE THAT ALL THINGS TURN TO HIS DELIGHT
OBSERVE BY THE WAY THAT EVERYTHING WHATEVER IT MAY BE WHICH IS SUBJECT TO AN EVIL DESTINY ALTHOUGH ONE TRIES TO SAVE IT FROM SOME MANIFEST EVIL FALLS AT ONCE INTO FAR WORSE PLIGHT
YOU SHALL TELL BENVENUTO THAT POPES HAVE AUTHORITY TO BIND AND LOOSE THINGS OF FAR GREATER CONSEQUENCE THAN THIS; AND WHILE THUS SPEAKING HE OPENED THE BOX WITH SOME SHOW OF ANGER TAKING OFF THE STRING AND SEALS WITH WHICH IT WAS DONE UP
NO SOONER HAD HE SEEN IT THAN HE EXPRESSED MUCH PLEASURE AND EXTOLLED IT TO THE SKIES
BUT MEANWHILE THOUGHT
SO WITH THE SURPLUS WHICH REMAINED FOR USE I MADE THIS VASE TO SHOW YOUR MAJESTY THE GRAND STYLE OF THE ANCIENTS
IT IS ONLY WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN MY PROFESSION
I LISTENED TO THEIR ADVICE THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO CONDUCT THE AFFAIR MORE FREELY
THAT POST IN THE PIOMBO IS WORTH MORE THAN 800 CROWNS A YEAR SO THAT IF I GAVE IT YOU YOU WOULD SPEND YOUR TIME IN SCRATCHING YOUR PAUNCH 1 AND YOUR MAGNIFICENT HANDICRAFT WOULD BE LOST AND I SHOULD BEAR THE BLAME. I REPLIED AT ONCE AS THUS
I MARCH FORWARD THEREFORE WITH A GOOD HEART SUSTAINED ALONE BY HIS DIVINE POWER
I FEEL THAT I AM DYING. MY HOUSEKEEPER WHO WAS NAMED MONA FIORE DA CASTEL DEL RIO A VERY NOTABLE MANAGER AND NO LESS WARM-HEARTED KEPT CHIDING ME FOR MY DISCOURAGEMENT
THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE PRESENT AMONG WHOM WERE MANY OF THE ADVERSARYS KINSFOLK
SO I DISENGAGED MYSELF FROM MY BABY AND LEFT THE BOY THERE SOBBING HIS HEART OUT
OF THE TWO GEESE ONE WAS ALMOST DEAD AND THE OTHER THOUGH BADLY WOUNDED WAS FLYING LAMELY
BENVENUTO IT SEEMS HAS CHOSEN TO DISPLAY HIS CHILDREN IN A VISION BUT NOT TO GIVE THEM TO THE TOUCH AS WE DID WHEN WE SPOKE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE CARRIED OUT WHILE HE HAS SHOWN A THING BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY. MESSER ALAMANNI TOOK MY SIDE
XI GIVES A SHORT ACCOUNT OF CECCHINO CELLINIS DEATH IN ROME MENTIONING ALSO BERTINO ALDOBRANDI IN THE ATTEMPT TO REVENGE WHOM HE LOST HIS LIFE
NOT HAVING THE FORCE AND COURAGE TO CONTEND WITH HIS OWN HANDS AGAINST ME HE ADOPTED THE TRULY LOMBARD DEVICE OF DEPRECIATING MY PERFORMANCES BY BECOMING A COPYIST OF ANTIQUES
BUT I STOOD FIRM AND LET NO BREATH OF FEAR PASS OVER ME
BUT AS THEY HAD DONE THE CONTRARY THEY OUGHT TO COMPLAIN OF THEMSELVES AND NOT OF ME
BORN WHAT HOW SLAVED TO SERVE THAT HATEFUL SIGN
HE WAS THE DUKES RIGHT EYE HANDSOME AND GOOD AND HIS LOSS WAS MOST SEVERELY FELT
HE WAS CALLED BOZZA AND USED ALWAYS TO BRING WITH HIM ANOTHER OF THE SAME SORT NAMED GIOVANNI AND NICKNAMED PEDIGNONE
YET HE HAD NOT READ CELLINIS MEMOIRS AND WAS FAR FROM PARTIAL TO THE MAN
ANTONIO THE FIRST EMBROIDERER OF HIS AGE
THAT IS IN ITALIAN THE ROUGH RIND, A NAME GIVEN TO RUSTICS
YOU SHALL HAVE WHAT YOU WANT
AS I WAS AFTERWARDS INFORMED HIS MAJESTY TWICE SHOWED SIGNS OF IRRITATION AND WAS MINDED TO USE ME ROUGHLY
WHILE I WAS ROUGH-HEWING THE BLOCK I MADE A MODEL
THE GENOESE THIEF WAS HANGED IN THE CAMPO DI FIORE WHILE I REMAINED IN BETTER REPUTE AS AN HONEST MAN THAN I HAD ENJOYED BEFORE
I KEPT SILENCE AND THE GENTLEMEN OF HIS EXCELLENCYS SUITE LOOKED HARD AT BANDINELLO TITTERING AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE SPEECH I HAD MADE IN THE ROOM ABOVE
INSTEAD OF SENDING TO COMMUNICATE THESE DETAILS YOUR MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP URGENTLY ORDERED ME TO COME BY THE POST AS IF AN ART LIKE MINE WAS CARRIED ON POST-HASTE
SACRED MAJESTY I ADMIT THAT ALL THAT YOU HAVE SAID IS TRUE
MY DEAR MICHEL AGNOLO YOUR NICKNAME OF CROW VERY WELL SUITS THOSE LADIES TO-DAY THOUGH I VOW THEY ARE SOMEWHAT LESS FAIR THAN CROWS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY PEACOCKS WHICH FANCY COULD HAVE PAINTED WHEN THE BANQUET WAS SERVED AND READY AND WE WERE GOING TO SIT DOWN TO TABLE GIULIO ASKED LEAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO PLACE US
LET THE READER JUDGE
BE VERY WELL ASSURED THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET IT. STILL SMARTING AS I WAS UNDER THE CALUMNIOUS INSULTS HE HAD FLUNG AT ME I LOST MY SELF-CONTROL FORGOT I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DUKE AND CALLED OUT IN A STORM OF FURY
MADE HIM CARDINAL IN 1539
I REGARD HIM AS A THOROUGHLY HONEST MAN
LUCA MARTINI WAS A MEMBER OF THE BEST LITERARY SOCIETY IN HIS DAYS AND THE AUTHOR OF SOME FAMOUS BURLESQUE PIECES
ASCANIO WHO WAS WELL ARMED STOOD HIS GROUND WITHOUT TRYING TO ESCAPE AS THE MILANESE HAD DONE
THAT EVENING I ENTERTAINED SEVERAL FRIENDS AT SUPPER AND HAVING PASSED THE TIME WITH GREAT ENJOYMENT BETOOK MYSELF TO BED
HE ADVISED ME TO WAIT TILL I WAS STRONGER AND TILL WE COULD OBSERVE HOW NATURE WORKED IN ME
WELL ONE EVENING AFTER SUNSET GAMBETTA CAME TO MY HOUSE WITH HER SON AND TOLD ME SHE HAD KEPT HIM SEVERAL DAYS INDOORS FOR MY WELFARE
WHEREUPON I TOOK UP SPEECH IN DEFENCE OF MY NEW MASTER
THERE WE SENT FOR A DOCTOR THE BEST WHO COULD BE HAD IN SUCH A PLACE
BECAUSE IT WAS ONE THING FOR JEWELLERS TO VALUE A STONE AFTER A PRINCE HAD BOUGHT IT AND ANOTHER THING TO ESTIMATE IT WITH A VIEW TO PURCHASE
DO BUT KILL THE RENEGADES AND WE WILL STAND BY YOU. THESE WORDS HAD THE EFFECT OF FRIGHTENING THE SPANIARDS IN GOOD EARNEST
XV
SURELY HIS GREAT TALENTS ENTITLE HIM TO EXCEPTIONAL TREATMENT
I ABOVE BY THE ANGEL KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THIS BUT SPIED A FELLOW DOWN THERE BUSYING HIMSELF ABOUT THE TRENCHES WITH A JAVELIN IN HIS HAND
SO THEN LET EVERY MAN WHO ENTERS INTO RELATION WITH THOSE SPIRITS WEIGH WELL THE INESTIMABLE PERILS I HAVE PASSED THROUGH
THE OTHER ATTACKED A MILANESE WHO WAS IN OUR COMPANY AND HAD THE WAYS AND MANNERS OF A PERFECT FOOL
LOOK MY DEAR BERNARDINO THAT YOU OBSERVE THE RULES WHICH I HAVE TAUGHT YOU
MEANWHILE I CAME TO LIFE AGAIN BY THE MEANS OF MORE THAN TWENTY LEECHES APPLIED TO MY BUTTOCKS BUT WITH MY BODY BORE THROUGH BOUND AND GROUND TO POWDER
TOGETHER WITH HIM MAESTRO RAFFAELLO DE PILLI UNDERTOOK THE SURGICAL PART OF MY CASE FORASMUCH AS THE SUBLIMATE HAD SO CORRODED THE INTESTINES THAT I WAS UNABLE TO RETAIN MY MOTIONS
THEREUPON THE POPE SAID
AND SO A VICAR OF CHRIST MAY NOT COMMIT ANY OF THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE
AFTERWARDS I RETURNED TO THE BANCHI TO LOOK ON AT THE GREAT COMMOTION WHICH ALWAYS HAPPENS ON SUCH OCCASIONS
WHENEVER THEY RECEIVED ONE OF THESE DESPATCHES THEY WENT TO THE KING AND BESIEGED HIS MAJESTY WITH ENTREATIES FOR THE CASTLE UPON THE SAME TERMS AS HE HAD GRANTED IT TO ME
I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
DURING EACH ACCESS OF THIS FEVER I WAS THROWN INTO DELIRIUM WHEN I CURSED MANTUA AND ITS MASTER AND WHOEVER STAYED THERE AT HIS OWN LIKING
THEN HE BEGAN ORDERING THE BARGEE TO STOP WHILE I KEPT ORDERING HIM TO GO ON
NOT RECEIVING THE PAY HE EXPECTED HE BROKE HIS WORK TO PIECES
HE CAME AT ONCE AND SET THE WORK OF FORTIFICATION GOING ON A VERY TEDIOUS METHOD WHICH MADE ME THROW THE JOB UP
FOR THE TRAITORS CROSS AT BEING DISTURBED THREW STONES AND STICKS AT HIM
VINCENZIO ROMOLI TOGETHER WITH AGNOLINO TENDED THE FIRE AND HEAPED ON QUANTITIES OF PRECIOUS PERFUMES
PRETIOSA IN CONSPECTU DOMINI IT MEANT THAT HIS PEACE WITH THE POPE HAD BEEN DEARLY BOUGHT
UNUS SPIRITUS ET UNA FIDES ERAT IN EIS AFTER THE POPE HAD ORDERED THIS HANDSOME COIN BANDINELLO THE SCULPTOR CAME UP
AND BOTH OF YOU HAVE LEARNED AS MUCH FROM ME AS I COULD TEACH IN MY POOR ART SO THAT YOU ARE NOW THE FIRST CRAFTSMEN AMONG THE YOUTHS OF ITALY
THEN HE DREW HIS CAP DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND ROARED OUT
FRANCESCO FUSCONI PHYSICIAN TO POPES ADRIAN VI CLEMENT VII AND PAUL III
WHILE I PORTRAYED HIM ACCURATELY IN WORDS THE OLD MAN TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND DRAGGED ME VIOLENTLY TOWARDS HIM
AFTERWARDS I SET OUT UPON THE ROAD TO PARIS
HIS WIFE CARESSED ME EVEN MORE THAN HE DID
AND SHE FOUND SUCH FAVOUR WITH HIM THAT HE ASKED HER IN MARRIAGE
AND THEN MICHEL AGNOLO WHO AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WAS THE MOST HUMOROUS AND AMUSING FELLOW IN THE WORLD LAID HIS TWO HANDS THE ONE ON GIULIOS AND THE OTHER ON GIAN FRANCESCOS SHOULDERS AND PULLING THEM WITH ALL HIS FORCE MADE THEM BOW DOWN WHILE HE ON HIS KNEES UPON THE FLOOR CRIED OUT FOR MERCY AND CALLED TO ALL THE FOLK IN WORDS LIKE THESE
A TREMENDOUS UPROAR ROSE UP FROM THE TRENCH
THEREFORE I BEGGED HIM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND BY THE KINDNESS HE HAD ALWAYS SHOWN ME NOT TO ADD GREATER EVILS TO THE MISERY OF MY PRESENT SITUATION
MOSTRAGNENE THIS IS PERHAPS EQUIVALENT TO MOSTRAGLIELO NOTE 4
LET IT SUFFICE THAT IT WAS I WHO SAVED THE CASTLE THAT MORNING AND BROUGHT THE OTHER BOMBARDIERS BACK TO THEIR DUTY
I NEED HARDLY REMIND MY READERS THAT GUARDAROBA OR WARDROBE WAS THE APARTMENT IN A PALACE WHERE ARMS PLATE FURNITURE AND CLOTHES WERE STORED
OLD NARDI TOOK OUR PART TELLING BENINTENDI PLAINLY THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG WHICH MADE HIM GO ON MUTTERING INSULTS
AND HIS DELIGHT IN THE WORK ALWAYS INCREASED
ON WHICH AS IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS I WILL MAKE NO FURTHER COMMENT
HOWEVER IN THE END I GOT THERE AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR WORK TO DO WHICH I OBTAINED FROM A MAESTRO NICCOLò OF MILAN GOLDSMITH TO THE DUKE OF MANTUA
THE DUKES ORDERS MEANWHILE WERE SO PRECISE THAT NO SOONER DID I KNOCK AT THOSE DOORS THAN THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY OPENED AND I WAS ALLOWED TO PASS FREELY WHERE I CHOSE
HAD NOT MY BROTHER BEEN PRESENT HER SPEECHLESSNESS AND SUDDEN SEIZURE MUST HAVE MADE HER HUSBAND IMAGINE I WAS SOME ONE DIFFERENT FROM A BROTHER-AS INDEED AT FIRST IT DID
COME FORWARD MESSER BENEDETTO MY FRIEND FOR NOW I AM RESOLVED AND IN GOOD FRAME OF MIND
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS PARTLY BECAUSE HE KEPT HIS DOINGS VERY DARK AND ALSO BECAUSE FONTAINEBLEAU IS FORTY MILES DISTANT FROM PARIS
THE WORK WAS ASSIGNED YOU ON THE STRENGTH OF YOUR MODELS AND STUDIES
WHILE HE WAS WRITING I WENT ON WORKING
HIS FULL NAME WAS TOMMASO CORTESE
HE RECOGNISED THE MAN BY CERTAIN INDICATIONS SEEING THAT THIS OFFICER HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN HIS SERVICE
HOWEVER I CLOTHED MY MIND WITH THE GRATITUDE DUE TO THAT GREAT BENEFIT AND DISPOSED MYSELF TO BE PATIENT AND TO AWAIT THE TERMINATION OF THE BUSINESS
I REJOINED THAT AS HE HAD DECIDED ON THE MODEL OF THAT BUILDING HE COULD LEAVE ITS EXECUTION TO HIS MAN URBINO WHO WOULD CARRY OUT HIS ORDERS TO THE LETTER
AND IT WAS LONG SINCE HE HAD SEEN SO MANY AT ONCE
A GONFALONIER OF THE REPUBLIC IN 1527
AMONG OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD AND OF GREAT WEIGHT UPON THIS POINT I WILL MENTION THE FOLLOWING
I ANSWERED THAT IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MY AMBITION TO DO THOSE THINGS WHICH OFFER THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES TO MEN AND THAT I HAD DONE THEM
THE KING DEEPLY IRRITATED COMMITTED ME TO THE CARE OF ANOTHER OFFICER OF HIS BODYGUARD WHO WAS NAMED MONSIGNOR LO ISCONTRO DORBECH
AMONG THEM WAS AN EMINENT PHILOSOPHER WHO SPOKE OUT IN MY FAVOUR
TO WHICH THE POPE MADE ANSWER THAT HE WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR IT BUT THAT HE DID NOT CARE TO LOOK AT THEM TILL I HAD COMPLETED MY MODEL
AH ME
AH ME
O BENVENUTO IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING TO PUT YOUR LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE DUKE TO RIGHTS
HE IS MUCH MORE TERRIBLE THAN YOU IMAGINE AND WELL WERE IT FOR HIM IF HE WERE A LITTLE LESS TERRIBLE
TO TELL THE TRUTH WHEREON MY MIND IS BENT HERE MAN KNOWS GOD NOR EVER STINTS TO PRAY FEELING HIS SOUL WITH HELLS FIERCE ANGUISH RENT
HIS HOLINESS HAD LET ME GO NOT CARING FOR THE SERVICE OF THE SAID BENVENUTO AND THE KING WHEN HE SAW HIM IN HIS REALM MOST WILLINGLY ADOPTED HIM
WELL THEN THE HOUR WAS DRAWING NIGH WHEN WE HAD TO PRESENT OURSELVES BEFORE THAT COMPANY OF MEN OF GENIUS EACH WITH HIS OWN CROW
BUT I TOOK CARE TO CUT THESE AND REPLACE THEM LIGHTLY SO THAT THEY ONLY JUST SUPPORTED THE IRONS OF THE HINGES
WHILE I HAD THIS WORK IN HAND THE POPE WAS OFTEN PLEASED TO LOOK AT IT
AND SO HE LED ME THROUGH THAT VAST HALL POINTING OUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING BY INNUMERABLE THOUSANDS UP AND DOWN THIS WAY AND THAT
ONE OF THEM HAD SEIZED AN IRON SHOVEL ANOTHER A THICK IRON PIPE ONE HAD AN ANVIL SOME OF THEM HAMMERS AND SOME CUDGELS
I AM NOT SORRY FOR MY OWN LOSS BUT FOR YOURS. WHY, SAID I TO HIM ARE YOU SORRY FOR MY TRIFLES AND NOT FOR ALL THAT PROPERTY OF YOURS? HE ANSWERED
AND ONE MORNING AFTER I HAD HEARD MASS AT SAN PIERO SCHERAGGIO THAT BRUTE BERNARDONE BROKER WORTHLESS GOLDSMITH AND BY THE DUKES GRACE PURVEYOR TO THE MINT PASSED BY ME
CELLINI RECEIVED THIS POST AMONG THE MAZZIERI WHO WALKED LIKE BEADLES BEFORE THE POPE ON APRIL 14 1531
THE WINDOW WAS SO CLOSE TO WHERE I SAT THAT BY MERELY RISING I COULD SEE LUIGI IN THE STREET TOGETHER WITH PANTASILEA
GO YOUR WAYS THEN
SACRED MAJESTY THIS MAN BENVENUTO IS VERY EAGER TO GET TO WORK AGAIN
AND IN THE MEANWHILE BEGAN THE BASON AND JUG ORDERED BY THE CARDINAL FERRARA
THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE
I BELIEVE CELLINI MEANT HERE TO WRITE ON A CHIEF ARGENT A LABEL OF FOUR POINTS AND THREE LILIES GULES. HE HAS TRICKED THE ARMS THUS IN A MS
FOR EVER IS MY WISH TOO
THEN I RECEIVED FOOD AND I REQUESTED MY JAILERS TO GIVE ME SOME OF MY BOOKS TO READ
AND NOT LONG AFTER MAKING HIS ACQUAINTANCE I TOOK HIM TO MY CASTLE AND THERE ASSIGNED HIM HIS OWN SUITE OF APARTMENTS
WHEREFORE I CONCEALED IT AS WELL AS I COULD
I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS ORDERS
THEY WERE ENGRAVED BY MEANS OF IRON IMPLEMENTS WITH FOLIAGE IN THE MOST EXQUISITE TURKISH STYLE VERY NEATLY FILLED IN WITH GOLD
THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME
ACCORDINGLY AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE I PREPARED THE EARTH BY ARTIFICIAL METHODS AND FOUND IT SERVE ME WELL AND WITH IT I CAST THE BUST
THE PROVOST OF PARIS WAS THEN JEAN DESTOUTEVILLE LORD OF VILLEBON
I SET OUT FIRMLY RESOLVED NOT TO LET MYSELF BE TAKEN AND IMPRISONED ALIVE
UNDER THESE DIFFICULTIES AND BY THE USE OF MY OWN MONEY I HAD SOON MARKED OUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORKSHOP AND CLEARED THE GROUND OF TREES AND VINES LABOURING ON ACCORDING TO MY WONT WITH FIRE AND PERHAPS A TRIFLE OF IMPATIENCE
AND THAT THE LORD HAD ANSWERED THAT THEY WERE ANTIQUE AND BESOUGHT HIM TO ASK FOR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IT MIGHT BE CONVENIENT FOR HIM TO GIVE PROVIDED ONLY HE WOULD LEAVE HIM THOSE
I WORE A WHITE DOUBLET WITH A PAIR OF WHITE HOSE AND A PAIR OF HALF BOOTS INTO WHICH I HAD STUCK THE PONIARD I HAVE MENTIONED
I HAD TO PASS THROUGH HIS WARDROBE THEN ACROSS THE STAGE OF THE GREAT HALL AND AFTERWARDS THROUGH CERTAIN LITTLE DARK GALLERIES AND CABINETS
I HUMBLY CRAVE YOUR PARDON. THEN THE DUKE SAID TO BANDINELLO
HEARING THIS I SAID TO ASCANIO
AND ONE OF THEM HE ENTRUSTED TO LUCAGNOLO THE OTHER TO ME
HE WAS A TRUCULENT AND STALWART FELLOW OF INCREDIBLY COARSE SPEECH WHOSE PRESUMPTION MATCHED HIS UTTER IGNORANCE
AND SINCE I HAVE TO TURN OUT A GREAT PIECE OF BRONZE I WILL AT THE SAME TIME TURN YOU INTO A RICH AND ABLE ARTIST. THIS MAN HAD A SPLENDID PERSON AND A MOST ARROGANT SPIRIT WITH THE AIR OF A GREAT SOLDIER MORE THAN A SCULPTOR ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO HIS VEHEMENT GESTURES AND HIS RESONANT VOICE TOGETHER WITH A HABIT HE HAD OF KNITTING HIS BROWS ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANY MAN OF COURAGE
THEN WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED HE REJOINED
NOW MAY LAD ASCANIO LOVED A VERY HANDSOME GIRL WHO RETURNED HIS PASSION
OH ARE YOU COME BACK? AND WITH THE SAME AIR OF SURPRISE CLAPPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER HE CRIED
INDEED THEY DID NOT BELIEVE A MERE ORDINARY FIEND COULD WORK SUCH MIRACLES AS I IN OTHER WAYS HAD SHOWN
PARDON ME PRINCE
WHEN I REACHED FONTAINEBLEAU ONE OF THE TREASURERS COMMISSIONED BY THE KING TO DEFRAY MY EXPENSES HE WAS CALLED MONSIGNOR DELLA FA 1 ADDRESSED ME IN THESE WORDS
I WOULD RATHER SAVE HIM THAN ANY OF THE CARDINALS IN ROME. EVERY DAY MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI CAME TO SEE ME TWO OR THREE TIMES AND EACH TIME HE TOOK UP ONE OR OTHER OF MY HANDSOME FOWLING-PIECES COATS OF MAIL OR SWORDS USING WORDS LIKE THESE
AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
MESSER FRANCESCO OF LUCCA SURNAMED IL PRETINO
MICHEL AGNOLO BUONARROTI AGAIN WHOM I AM PROUD TO CALL MY MASTER
AFTER THIS I SAID QUI HABITAT IN ADJUTORIO THEN I COMMUNED A SPACE WITH GOD
AND MOST FREQUENTLY THE CARDINAL OF RAVENNA AND THE CARDINAL DE GADDI
I CAN ALSO BRING TO MIND SOME PLEASANT GOODS AND SOME INESTIMABLE EVILS WHICH WHEN I TURN MY THOUGHTS BACKWARD STRIKE TERROR IN ME AND ASTONISHMENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE REACHED THIS AGE OF FIFTY-EIGHT WHEREIN THANKS BE TO GOD I AM STILL TRAVELLING PROSPEROUSLY FORWARD
BUT HE HAD MET WITH SOME DIFFICULTIES THERE WHICH WOULD NOT OCCUR IN THE MOUNTAINS OF NORCIA
THE FOUR GERMAN GENTLEMEN HAVING GAINED THE TOP BEFORE US SENT DOWN SOME FOLK WHO GAVE US AID
HE CALLED HIS TREASURER AT ONCE WHO WAS THE VISCOUNT OF ORBEC AND ORDERED HIM THAT VERY DAY TO DISBURSE TO ME A THOUSAND CROWNS OF GOOD WEIGHT AND OLD GOLD
AND WHEN HE SAW ME LOOKING ROUND HE ORDERED HIS MASTER OF THE WARDROBE A CERTAIN PRETINO OF LUCCA TO LET ME TAKE WHATEVER I LIKED
WHILE HE SPOKE THESE WORDS AND URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD THE ANIMAL SUDDENLY SLIPPED OVER THE BRIDGE AND FELL WITH LEGS IN AIR CLOSE TO A HUGE ROCK THERE WAS THERE
NOW IN THE MUSEUM OF THE BARGELLO PALACE AT FLORENCE LXIV I COULD SEE THAT THIS SPEECH MADE NO IMPRESSION ON THE DUKE FOR HE KEPT SILENCE
1 THE BUTLER THEN WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO UTTER A WORD CRIED
IF HEAVEN AGAINST YOU ROLL WHO STANDS FOR US
WE HAVE A SERIOUS JOB ON HAND HERE! THEN I THREW THE SAFE-CONDUCT TO THEM AND SAID
MY BROTHER INDEED ATTEMPTED TO PREVENT THIS COMING TO MY EARS
AMONGST OTHER BEAUTIFUL ORNAMENTS THIS VASE HAD A HANDLE MADE ALL OF ONE PIECE WITH MOST DELICATE MECHANISM WHICH WHEN A SPRING WAS TOUCHED STOOD UPRIGHT ABOVE THE MOUTH OF IT
OF GIACOPO SALVIATI WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD P
LET ME ALONE THEN WITH MY TROUBLES AND MY TRIBULATIONS AND DONT GIVE ME MORE ANNOYANCE THAN I HAVE ALREADY
I ALSO CONCEIVED THE NOTION OF CASTING THE LARGE MODEL OF MY JUPITER IN BRONZE
YET I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOVER MY SENSES FOR I THOUGHT MY HEAD HAD BEEN CUT OFF AND FANCIED THAT I WAS IN PURGATORY
ONE WAS THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST THE SECOND THE RESURRECTION AND THE THIRD S
THE FORMER TOOK PRECEDENCE OF THE LATTER BOTH IN POLITICAL IMPORTANCE AND IN SOCIAL ESTEEM
HE WAS THE SON OF A SPANISH COPPERSMITH
THIS SCULPTOR WAS ANTONIO SOLOSMEO OF SETTIGNANO
ACCORDINGLY I PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM WITH A LIGHTED MATCH IN HAND
CXIII WHILE THESE WORDS WERE BEING SPOKEN THE GENTLEMAN OF SANTA FIORE WITH WHOM I HAD THAT QUARREL WAS PRESENT AND CONFIRMED TO THE POPE WHAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN BY HIS SON
BUT WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONTRACT WHICH WAS DRAWN UP BY SER GIOVANNI SON OF SER MATTEO DA FALGANO SBIETTA OBJECTED THAT THE TERMS WE HAD AGREED ON WOULD INVOLVE OUR PAYING THE LARGEST DUTIES TO THE REVENUE
CXVI WHEN THE DAY DAWNED THE GUARD WOKE ME UP AND SAID
AFTER I HAD LABOURED DILIGENTLY FOR EIGHT DAYS THE POPE SENT WORD BY ONE OF HIS CHAMBERLAINS A VERY GREAT GENTLEMAN OF BOLOGNA THAT I WAS TO COME TO HIM AND BRING WHAT I HAD GOT IN HAND
THIS MADE HIM THINK THAT I HAD FINISHED WHEN I HAD HARDLY BEGUN SO THAT I COULD NOT MAKE HIM COMPREHEND WHAT A LONG TIME IT TOOK TO EXECUTE A THING OF THAT SORT THOROUGHLY
GO ON GO ON AT WORK TILL IT IS FINISHED. I ANSWERED AS I TOOK MY LEAVE THAT I WOULD FINISH IT IF HE PAID ME THE MONEY
PETER CRUCIFIED HEAD DOWNWARDS
IT MUST FIRST BE MENTIONED THAT I HAD FORBIDDEN ALL THE MEN WHO LIVED AT MY COST TO BRING LIGHT WOMEN INTO MY HOUSE OR ANYWHERE WITHIN THE CASTLE PRECINCTS
MY LORD I DO NOT NOW RECEIVE THE MONIES NECESSARY FOR MY TASK WHICH MAKES ME FEAR THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN ME
AND TELL THAT LORD WHO KEEPS ME HERE THAT IF HE WILL GIVE ME WAX OR PAPER AND THE MEANS OF PORTRAYING THIS GLORY OF GOD WHICH WAS REVEALED TO ME MOST ASSUREDLY SHALL I CONVINCE HIM OF THAT WHICH NOW PERHAPS HE HOLDS IN DOUBT. CXXIII THE PHYSICIANS GAVE THE CASTELLAN NO HOPE OF HIS RECOVERY YET HE REMAINED WITH A CLEAR INTELLECT AND THE HUMOURS WHICH USED TO AFFLICT HIM EVERY YEAR HAD PASSED AWAY
AND AS MUCH AS I THEN SAID WILL COME TO HAPPEN BETWEEN YOUR CHILDREN AND MINE. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE UNGRATEFUL PIERO DIED OF THAT ILLNESS
IF IT FALLS TO YOU I WILL DISMISS FROM MY MIND THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT INJURY YOU HAVE DONE ME AND WILL BLESS YOUR HANDS AS BEING WORTHIER THAN MINE OF SO GLORIOUS A PERFORMANCE
BUT I ALSO TOOK TO WATCHING THE ARQUEBUSIER WHO SHOT MY BROTHER AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN A GIRL I WAS IN LOVE WITH
4 ACCORDINGLY ONE HAD TO CARRY ONES SWORD BOUND TILL THE GATES WERE PASSED
YET I DID NOT OMIT TO PRESENT MYSELF PRETTY FREQUENTLY TO HIS LORDSHIP WHO MADE SHOW OF TREATING ME WITH GREAT DISTINCTION
IT COULD INDEED BE SEEN BY MORE THAN HALF PARIS
WHEN HE HAD SUFFICIENTLY COMMENDED IT THE OTHERS STANDING TERRIFIED AND STUPID BEFORE HIM HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
AFTER FIFTY DAYS MY HEALTH WAS RE-ESTABLISHED AND I CONTINUED WITH THE UTMOST CARE TO KEEP IT AND CONFIRM IT
AND WHEN I SAW THAT GRAND PARADE SO ARTFULLY PLANNED I SAID TO MYSELF
1 PERHAPS WHEN HE FINDS HIMSELF IN SUCH ILL PLIGHT HE WILL BEGIN TO DROOP HIS CREST. CAPTAIN SANDRINO MONALDI CAME AT ONCE INTO MY PRISON WITH ABOUT TWENTY OF THE CASTELLANS SERVANTS
I LOST MY PATIENCE AT THIS NONSENSE AND SAID TO THEM
YET I QUICKLY REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT MY CUSTOM TO PUT PRICES ON MY WORK AND THAT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HIS EXCELLENCY HAD PROMISED ME TWO DAYS AGO
I WENT TO VISIT HIM WITHOUT ANY CEREMONY AND WAS RECEIVED WITH HIS USUAL RESERVE AND AUSTERITY
THESE TWO MEN OF GENIUS RECEIVED ME WITH MARKED KINDNESS
HE HAS NOT FINISHED ONE OF THEM YET
CELLINI BEGAN TO WRITE HIS MEMOIRS IN 1558
TAKE THAT THING THERE! AT THIS CRISIS WHEN THE WHOLE GANG SAW THE CAKE WAS ON THE POINT OF MELTING THEY DID MY BIDDING EACH FELLOW WORKING WITH THE STRENGTH OF THREE
THEN WITH CAPS IN HAND THEY UTTERED AN ORATION SO CEREMONIOUS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCESSIVE FOR A POPE
GO AND TELL HIM THAT HIS JEWELS ARE ALL IN HIS POSSESSION
WHILE PASSING SOME OPEN PORTIONS OF THE GALLERY HE THREW HIS VIOLENT MANTLE AND CAP OF A MONSIGNORE OVER THE WHITE STOLE OF THE PONTIFF FOR FEAR HE MIGHT BE SHOT AT BY THE SOLDIERS IN THE STREETS BELOW
GO AND GET YOURSELVES NEW SUITS OF CLOTHES
HE WAS COVERED WITH HAIR FOUR FINGERS LONG AND WAS EXACTLY AS BIG AS A WELL-GROWN BEAR
XXXII I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO DIGRESS A LITTLE FROM THE HISTORY OF MY ART UNLESS I WERE TO OMIT SOME ANNOYING INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF MY TROUBLED CAREER
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS THAT MOST ACCOMPLISHED MAN AND MY DEAR FRIEND COMPOSED AN ADMIRABLE SONNET UPON MY SUPPOSED BUT NOT REAL DEATH WHICH SHALL BE REPORTED IN ITS PROPER PLACE
THE OTHERS DID THE SAME
OSSICINA CHE SEGUITANO IL DITO C
INFERNO III THE VERSES ABOUT CHARON
FEARING TO STRIKE HIS OWN FOLK HE DARED NOT DISCHARGE THE CANNON AND FLINGING THE BURNING FUSE UPON THE GROUND HE WEPT AS THOUGH HIS HEART WOULD BREAK AND TORE HIS CHEEKS WITH BOTH HIS HANDS
ANGELO IN THE YEAR 1530 WHERE CLEMENT MADE HIM PERISH MISERABLY BY DIMINISHING HIS FOOD AND WATER DAILY TILL HE DIED
AND THEN HE WOULD FLAP HIS HANDS AND BODY AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO FLY
AT THIS POINT ONE MAY OBSERVE HOW THE STARS DO NOT SO MUCH SWAY AS FORCE OUR CONDUCT
AND I SAID TO HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE IS MARRIED
CVII A YEAR HAD NOW PASSED SINCE I BOUGHT THE FARM OF DELLA FONTE FROM SBIETTA
DO YOU THINK I DO NOT KNOW HOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN? THEN SHE TURNED TO ME AND BEGGED ME TO KEEP THE LAD HIDDEN IN MY HOUSE BECAUSE THE BARGELLO WAS AFTER HIM AND WOULD SEIZE HIM ANYWHERE OUTSIDE MY HOUSE BUT THERE THEY WOULD NOT DARE TO TOUCH HIM
AND NOW THAT THEY HAD SETTLED WHAT I ASKED IT BEHOVED US TO BE CIVIL TO THEM AND DISMISS THEM GENTLY
I FOUND THEM AT TABLE
ONCE MORE HE CRIED OUT THAT HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS AT THE DUKE AND US AND THAT WE WERE ALL OF US A HEAP OF DONKEYS
VASARI MENTIONS A GIROLAMO FAGIUOLI WHO FLOURISHED AT THIS PERIOD BUT CALLS HIM A BOLOGNESE
HE WAS A MAN OF INFAMOUS HABITS QUITE UNFIT FOR THE HIGH DIGNITIES CONFERRED ON HIM
SO I DID NOT CHOOSE TO ALIGHT AT MY SHOP BUT SENT FOR FELICE MY PARTNER AND GOT HIM TO PUT MY LITTLE DWELLING FORTHWITH INTO EXCELLENT ORDER
THEN I TOOK HIM TO SEE THE JUPITER IN SILVER NOW NEARLY COMPLETED WITH ALL ITS SPLENDID DECORATIONS
I HAD TO PAY THE WORKMEN OUT OF MY OWN POCKET
PIG POLTROON DONKEY
ACCORDINGLY I LAID HAND TO MY LITTLE DAGGER AND TOLD THEM TO DO AS I HAD SHOWN THEM SEEING THAT THE HORSES WOULD SAVE THEIR LIVES AS WELL AS I TOO HOPED TO ESCAPE WITH MINE BY THE SAME MEANS
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT BENEDETTO DA CAGLI WAS ONE OF CELLINIS THREE EXAMINERS DURING HIS FIRST IMPRISONMENT IN S
THE NAME OF THIS MASTER WAS ANTONIO AND HE WAS IN TRUTH A WORTHY MAN IN THE MUSICIANS ART
THIS FLIMSY LITTLE FELLOW WITH HIS TINY SPIDERS HANDS AND SMALL GNATS VOICE MOVED ABOUT THE BUSINESS AT A SNAILS PACE
CELLINI CALLS IT ISVIVATOIO IT IS PROPERLY AVVIVATOIO A SORT OF BRASS ROD WITH A WOODEN HANDLE
NEER LION TIGER WOLF OR BEAR KNEW GREED HUNGRIER THAN THAT MAN FELT FOR HUMAN BLOOD
AFTER TELLING THE SERVANT TO INTRODUCE ME HE GREETED ME WITH SOME OF HIS LOMBARD COMPLIMENTS AND ASKED WHAT GOOD BUSINESS HAD BROUGHT ME HITHER
E GIROLAMO PASCUCCI
THIS LASTED MORE THAN AN HOUR AND A HALF
BUT ON COMING DOWN UPON THE OTHER SIDE HE TURNED A COMPLETE SOMERSAULT
SO THEN HE IS THE SON OF MAESTRO GIOVANNI? ON BEING ASSURED I WAS THE POPE EXPRESSED HIS WISH TO HAVE ME IN HIS SERVICE WITH THE OTHER BANDSMEN
MEANWHILE THE NECROMANCER TREMBLING WITH FEAR KEPT DOING HIS BEST WITH MILD AND SOFT PERSUASIONS TO DISMISS THEM
TURNING ROUND TO HIS SON HE SAID
WHERETO FRANCESCO DEL NERO HIS TREASURER REPLIED
IT WAS A FRIDAY AND I HAD IT IN SALAD SAUCE AND POTTAGE
THEN WITH ALL THE SPEED I COULD I TOOK THE ROAD TO PALOMBARA A FIEF OF MY LORD GIOVANBATISTA SAVELLO WHENCE I SENT THE HORSE BACK TO MESSER GIOVANNI WITHOUT HOWEVER THINKING IT WELL TO INFORM HIM WHERE I WAS
THE WHOLE MASS STRUCK ME IN THE CHEST AND TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
HALF IN DESPAIR AS I THEN WAS NEWS COMING THAT MY AFFAIRS IN FRANCE WERE GOING WRONG AND THESE IN FLORENCE PROMISING BUT ILL THROUGH THE LUKE-WARMNESS OF MY PATRON I COULD NEVER STOP LISTENING TILL HALF THE SONG WAS FINISHED
I FEAR THEREFORE LEST THEY MIGHT TOO EASILY TAKE TO A BAD COURSE OF LIFE
MARK WELL HOW GLORY STEEPS HER SONS IN GLOOM
THEY ATTACKED ME WITH SUCH INSULTS THAT I COULD HARDLY HOLD MY OWN AGAINST THEM
FOR HEAVENS SAKE DO IT
FOLK TOO GATHERED ROUND US FOR IT HAD BECOME CLEAR THAT OUR WORDS MEANT SWORDS AND DAGGERS
THE FURIOUS ENVY OF BANDINELLO HOWEVER WHO KEPT ALWAYS WHISPERING IN THE DUKES EARS HAD SUCH EFFECT THAT HE MADE HIM BELIEVE MY FIRST SUCCESSES WITH A SINGLE FIGURE OR TWO PROVED NOTHING
WHO WILLS TO KNOW WHAT WEAL AWAITS HIM MUST FIRST LEARN THE ILL THAT GOD FOR HIM HATH WROUGHT
NO SOONER DID THE DUKE SET EYES ON HIM THAN HE BADE HIM BEGONE
HE USED TO KEEP ME AT HIS TABLE EATING OPPOSITE TO HIM AND NEVER STOPPED CHATTING AND MAKING ME CHAT
ALL THE REST OF THEIR FORM WAS HUMAN
AND ONE EVENING I WOUNDED HIM IN THE LEGS AND ARMS SO SEVERELY TAKING CARE HOWEVER NOT TO KILL HIM THAT I DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF BOTH HIS LEGS
BUT AT THE PRESENT TIME HE DOES NOT CARE TO GO ON WORKING. THEN THEY TOUCHED ON OTHER TOPICS
THE DISPUTE WAXED WARM BECAUSE FIRENZUOLA WAS AN ADMIRABLE SWORDSMAN FAR BETTER THAN HE WAS A GOLDSMITH
BUT HE HAD NO WILL TO GO
AND HAVING COME WITHIN A MILE OF NAPLES WE WERE MET BY AN INNKEEPER WHO INVITED US TO HIS HOUSE AND SAID HE HAD BEEN AT FLORENCE MANY YEARS WITH CARLO GINORI
IF ONLY YOU DO NOT KILL ME I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU COMMAND. THEN, SAID I PUT THAT RING UPON HER HAND. WHEN THE SWORDS POINT WAS WITHDRAWN A FEW INCHES FROM HIS THROAT HE WEDDED HER WITH THE RING
THE DUKE WAS NEVER TIRED OF EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION AND GAVE ME INSCRIPTIONS FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE MEDAL
THE CARDINAL OF SANTA FIORE WAS ON A VISIT TO FLORENCE AND THE DUKE TOOK HIM TO POGGIO A CAIANO
IN THE MIDDLE WAS THE LOOKING-GLASS
HIS LEFT HAND RESTED ON A SCIMITAR
CECCHINO BEING STILL QUITE A LAD WAS RETURNING FROM HIS FIRST LESSON IN THE SCHOOL OF THE STUPENDOUS GIOVANNINO DE MEDICI
THEN SEEING THAT TIME DRAGGED ON AND BEING MADDENED BY HUNGER I COULD NO LONGER HOLD OUT BUT FLUNG OFF SENDING HER MOST DEVOUTLY TO THE DEVIL
NOW THOUGH HE WAS A MAN OF PROFOUND ERUDITION AND WITHOUT A RIVAL IN POETRY HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT MY ART
I HAD HARDLY TIME TO FINISH THE WORD BOX BEFORE PRINZIVALLE DELLA STUFA 3 WHO WAS ONE OF THE EIGHT INTERRUPTED ME BY SAYING
EVERY EVENING HE MINUTELY EXAMINED THE HOLDFASTS OF THE HINGES AND THE WHOLE CHAMBER AND I USED TO SAY
POLISH UP THIS RING FOR ME AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT. I WAS ENGAGED AT THE MOMENT UPON JEWEL-WORK OF GOLD AND GEMS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
CELLINI ALLUDES TO A CELEBRATED INUNDATION OF THE YEAR 1547
HE HAD LONG SET HIS HEART ON HAVING SUCH A MONUMENT AND HE BEGGED ME TO BEGIN A MODEL FOR THE SAME
THAT DAY HE HAD WITH HIM A SMALL SCIMITAR WHICH IT WAS AT TIMES HIS WONT TO CARRY HIDDEN BENEATH HIS CLOTHES
BUT WE MEAN TO HAVE NO MORE DUKES; AND THEREUPON HE JEERED ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE FACTIONS WHICH MAKE DUKES
THE POPE WAS IN BED SUFFERING FROM A SLIGHT INDISPOSITION AND HE HAD WITH HIM MESSER JACOPO SALVIATI AND THE ARCHBISHOP OF CAPUA
MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTE VARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
THE KING HAD SENT MINE OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND SUCH AN ACT OF GRACE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN THAT REALM BEFORE
BENEDETTO WAS WALKING WITH HIS MASTERS AND THEY ANNOYED BY THE INTERRUPTION SCOLDED HIM SHARPLY SAYING THEY WOULD BE SERVED BY SOMEBODY ELSE IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO SUCH BARKING
AND TWICE OR THRICE I HAVE ALREADY CLASPED MY FINGERS ON THE HANDLE. WITH WORDS TO THIS EFFECT AND MANY UGLY BLOWS TO BOOT I DROVE THE WOMAN AND HER SON INTO THE STREET
AND HERE HER HAND RESTED
CLAUDE D ANNEBAULT
FOR THEY KEPT HAMMERING AT HIM NIGHT AND DAY MADAME AT ONE TIME AND BOLOGNA AT ANOTHER
THE PRINCE REPLIED WITH A THREATENING TOSS OF HIS HEAD
HE MENTIONS IN PARTICULAR A CERTAIN PIETRO MARGANO WHO HAD ACQUIRED GREAT FAME AND POPULARITY BY KILLING THE BARGELLO OF HIS DAY ONE CENCIO IN THE CAMPO DI FIORE
I REPLIED TO HIS MAJESTY THAT THE MOMENT I LEFT OFF WORKING I SHOULD FALL ILL
SACRED MAJESTY OUR MOST HOLY FATHER POPE PAOLO SENDS THIS BOOK OF THE VIRGIN AS A PRESENT TO YOUR MAJESTY THE WHICH IS WRITTEN IN A FAIR CLERKS HAND AND ILLUMINATED BY THE GREATEST MASTER WHO EVER PROFESSED THAT ART
NEVERTHELESS HE HARBOURED IN HIS HEART A DEEP VINDICTIVE FEELING AGAINST ME OF WHICH I WAS NOT SLOW TO BE AWARE SINCE I HAD NO LONGER THE SAME EASY ACCESS TO HIS APARTMENTS AS FORMERLY BUT FOUND THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING AUDIENCE
BECAUSE IT IS NOT HE WHO SPEAKS NAY BUT THE VERY VOICE OF GOD THROUGH HIM
HE WAS MESSER GUIDO GUIDI AN ABLE PHYSICIAN AND DOCTOR OF MEDICINE AND A NOBLEMAN OF FLORENCE
LXXI THE FELLOW COULD NOT STAND QUIET TO HEAR THE DAMNING ERRORS OF HIS CACUS IN THEIR TURN ENUMERATED
THE HOUR IS RECKONED ACCORDING TO THE OLD ITALIAN FASHION FROM SUNSET OF ONE DAY TO SUNSET OF THE NEXT-TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
SO THEY BEGAN TO DOCTOR ME AS ENERGETICALLY AS THEY WERE ABLE WHILE I GREW DAILY WORSE AND WORSE SO RAPIDLY THAT AFTER EIGHT DAYS THE PHYSICIANS DESPAIRED OF MY LIFE AND SAID THAT I MIGHT BE INDULGED IN ANY WHIM I HAD TO MAKE ME COMFORTABLE
SO AFTER THIS FASHION HE CONDUCTED ME TO THE SPACIOUS ROOMS WHICH I HAD PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED THAT IS TO SAY IN 1538 WHERE I OBTAINED ALL THE CONVENIENCES I ASKED FOR
1 FROM HOME I TRAVELLED TO FLORENCE FROM FLORENCE TO BOLOGNA FROM BOLOGNA TO VENICE AND FROM VENICE TO PADUA
OUR BAD LUCK! I RETORTED
ACCORDINGLY THEY KEPT CONTINUALLY TRYING TO INSPIRE ME WITH THE FEAR OF IMMINENT DEATH BY MEANS OF VARIOUS TERRIFYING HINTS
THE KING HAD NOW RETURNED TO PARIS
THIS WOULD BE WELL SEEN AND WOULD CONFER FAR MORE GLORY ON HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
THE FIRST IS THAT BY WHICH ONE GAINS FOR ONES SELF THE SECOND THAT BY WHICH ONE GAINS FOR OTHERS
IN RETURN FOR THIS HIS EXCELLENCY BADE ME FORMULATE MY DEMANDS IN A PETITION DETAILING ALL MY REQUIREMENTS
SWERVING ASIDE THE SWORD HIT PANTASILEA FULL IN NOSE AND MOUTH
HOWEVER I WILL NOT ENLARGE UPON IT FURTHER ONLY ADDING THAT I WAS WITHIN AN INCH OF REVENGING MY FATHER ON MESSER JACOPO SALVIATI WHO HAD GRIEVOUSLY INJURED HIM ACCORDING TO MY FATHERS COMPLAINTS
I ENTREAT YOU TO DO ME THE FAVOUR OF GRANTING ME INDULGENCE SO THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO CONFESS AND COMMUNICATE AND BY THE GRACE OF YOUR HOLINESS REGAIN THE GRACE OF MY LORD GOD. UPON THIS THE POPE WITH A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SIGH REMEMBERING PERHAPS HIS FORMER TRIALS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
THE RESULT WAS THAT I ENJOYED A VERY PLEASANT NIGHT FAR MORE TO MY SATISFACTION THAN IF I HAD PASSED IT WITH FAUSTINA
I DID NOT PICTURE TO MY FANCY ANY BETTER RECOMPENSE FROM YOUR EXCELLENCY
THEN SHE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
THE LATTER WAS CONSTRUCTED OF WOOD AND WAX
TO BITE THE THUMB AT ANY ONE WAS AS STUDENTS OF OUR OLD DRAMA KNOW A SIGN OF CHALLENGE OR PROVOCATION
LOOK YOU BENVENUTO YOU ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT AN ENTERPRISE WHICH THE LAWS OF ART DO NOT SANCTION AND WHICH CANNOT SUCCEED. I TURNED UPON HIM WITH SUCH FURY AND SO FULL OF MISCHIEF THAT HE AND ALL THE REST OF THEM EXCLAIMED WITH ONE VOICE
I AM AWARE THAT YOU KNEW THE KING HAD COMMISSIONED ME WITH THAT GREAT COLOSSUS
WHEREUPON ALL THE BYSTANDERS SEEING THE GREAT QUANTITY OF BLOOD JUDGED THAT HE WAS REALLY DEAD
MONSIGNOR SUPPOSE WE LET HIM SAY A HUNDRED WORDS IF HE LIKES
1 BUT THE GOOD PRINZIVALLE PUT A STOP TO THAT
SO THEN THESE FELLOWS ENTERED ALL IN ARMOUR AS FEARFUL OF ME AS THOUGH I WERE A POISON-BREATHING DRAGON
HE ALSO TOOK WIFE AND HAD FOUR MALE CHILDREN
ONLY THE IMPORTUNITY OF MADAME DETAMPES SECURED THIS FAVOUR FOR HIM
ACCORDINGLY HE MADE AN EQUITABLE JUDGMENT AND HAD MY STATUE VALUED ALSO AT TWO THOUSAND DUCATS SAYING
1 UPON ACCEPTING IT THE EMPEROR EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION AND IMMEDIATELY ASKED FOR ME
MESSER JACOPO MEN OF WORTH ACT LIKE MEN OF WORTH AND MEN OF GENIUS WHO PRODUCE THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND EXCELLENT SHINE FORTH FAR BETTER WHEN OTHER PEOPLE PRAISE THEM THAN WHEN THEY BOAST SO CONFIDENTLY OF THEIR OWN ACHIEVEMENTS. UPON THIS HE AND I ROSE FROM TABLE BLOWING OFF THE STEAM OF OUR CHOLER
THE SACRED KING IS LORD OF ALL THINGS HERE
HOWEVER I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING FOR CERTAIN ABOUT THIS
I WHO WAS BUT A FEW STEPS BEHIND HIM STOPPED MY HORSE AND WAITED TO SEE THE DONKEY GET OUT OF THE WATER
HE DEFENDED CREMA FOR THE VENETIANS IN 1514 AND CONQUERED URBINO FOR THE POPE IN 1515
IT DENOTES GENIUS ARTISTIC ABILITY MASCULINE FORCE C
FOR IF HE GAVE ME UP TO THE POPE HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE SENDING ME TO DEATH
FOR I SPOKE TO THEM AT ONCE ABOUT IT AND SINCE THAT TIME HAVE NEVER ONCE ALLUDED TO THE MATTER BECAUSE YOUR EXCELLENCY TOLD ME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS WHICH MADE ME THINK YOU WANTED TO KEEP UP THE CREDIT OF YOUR STONE
3 IT IS VERY TRUE THAT ONE SAYS TO ONESELF
SEE MY RENAISSANCE IN ITALY VOL
WHEN THE BUTTON CAME HE WAS STILL MORE STRUCK WITH WONDER
MY BENVENUTO IF YOU HAD AN AFFAIR WITH MARS I AM SURE YOU WOULD COME OUT WITH HONOUR BECAUSE THROUGH ALL THE YEARS THAT I HAVE KNOWN YOU I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU WRONGFULLY TAKE UP A QUARREL. SO HE CONSENTED TO BE MY SECOND AND WE REPAIRED WITH SWORD IN HAND TO THE APPOINTED PLACE BUT NO BLOOD WAS SHED FOR MY OPPONENT MADE THE MATTER UP AND I CAME WITH MUCH CREDIT OUT OF THE AFFAIR
BUT SINCE IT IS SO GO AND TAKE THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS WHEN YOU THINK FIT TO POMPEO. I TOOK MY PIECE UP WENT AWAY AND CARRIED THE CROWNS TO POMPEO ON THE INSTANT
MOREOVER HE TOOK ME TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE VICEROY OF NAPLES WHO HAD LET HIM KNOW THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ME
IN REPLY I TOLD HIM THAT IF MY ADVICE WAS TAKEN I WOULD SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE DIAMOND
THIS NIGHT WAS SO AMUSING THAT IT TURNED ALL OUR TROUBLES INTO LAUGHTER
IT IS TRUE THAT IN ITALY WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS OF DESIGNING FOLIAGE
IN 1556 HE ALSO PURCHASED LAND THERE
THE KING NOW CAME TO PARIS AND I WENT TO PAY HIM MY RESPECTS
AND IN THIS WAY ALWAYS SINGING AND LAUGHING WE TRAVELLED THE WHOLE WAY TO ROME
BUT HAVING SHARPENED MY WITS UP I SUCCEEDED NOT ONLY IN MAKING SOMETHING QUITE AS GOOD BUT IN EXCEEDING IT BY FAR
SO THEN THEY PUT THEIR NOW PIECE INTO THE FURNACE WITH MUCH LAUGHTER
THEN SHE ASKED WHAT I WAS DOING AND I REPLIED
WHAT THIS MEANT I NEED HARDLY EXPLAIN
ANOTHER TIME HE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD AND THEN THEY HAD TO BURY HIM
TO THIS HE ANSWERED THAT WE MIGHT GET THROUGH WITH IT IN LESS THAN A MONTH AND THAT THE MOST SUITABLE LOCALITY FOR THE PURPOSE WAS THE HILL COUNTRY OF NORCIA
THE COLLEGIUM ABBREVIATORUM DI PARCO MAJORI CONSISTED OF SEVENTY-TWO MEMBERS
MONSIGNOR WE ARE NOT ALL MADE AFTER THE SAME PATTERN
BUT THE CARDINAL SAID HE DID NOT CARE TO UNDERTAKE SO IMPORTANT AN AFFAIR
BUT HE ONLY UNDERTOOK A CURE AFTER STIPULATING FOR HIS FEES WHICH HE RECKONED NOT BY TENS BUT BY HUNDREDS OF CROWNS
JUST THEN I MET MESSER CHERUBINO AND THE WOUNDED MILANESE
3 QUITTING THE CONVENT AND ISSUING FROM THE CITY BY THE GATE OF PRATO I WENT ALONG THE WALLS AS FAR AS THE PIAZZA DI SAN GALLO
WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD MY FATHER HAPPENED TO BE IN A BASEMENT-CHAMBER OF OUR HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WASHING AND WHERE A GOOD FIRE OF OAK-LOGS WAS STILL BURNING
TO WHICH THE KING ANSWERED
THE KING WHO WAS A MAN OF GREAT GOODNESS AND PERSPICACITY WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THE PRESUMPTUOUS DEMANDS OF THOSE SCOUNDRELS SINCE HE SCENTED THE MALIGNITY OF THEIR AIMS
2 NOTE 1
ACCORDINGLY I WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE REMONSTRANCES OF THOSE INGENIOUS AND WORTHY MEN BUT TOOK MY SWORD AND WENT ALONE TOWARD PRATI:-THE HOUSE WHERE WE WERE SUPPING I SHOULD SAY STOOD CLOSE TO THE CASTELLO GATE WHICH LED TO PRATI
YOUR HOLINESS CAN BOAST OF HAVING A CURRENCY SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE ANCIENTS IN ALL THEIR GLORY. THE POPE REPLIED
ALL THREE WENT TOGETHER TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SPOKEN TO THE POPE
NO SOONER HAD HE ENTERED THE ENCLOSURE AND CAST HIS EYES UPON MY WORK THAN HE GAVE SIGNS OF BEING GREATLY SATISFIED
CXIII ABOUT THAT TIME THE DUKE WENT ON A JOURNEY ATTENDED BY ALL HIS COURT AND ALL HIS SONS EXCEPT THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN SPAIN
WHEN I CAME UP THE DOG HAD LOST ALL FEAR OF SWORD OR STAVES AND WAS FLYING ONCE MORE AT THE YOUNG MAN
LE SANTE MARIE SO THE FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION IS CALLED AT FLORENCE BECAUSE DEVOTION IS PAID ON THAT DAY TO THE VARIOUS IMAGES OF THE VIRGIN SCATTERED THROUGH THE TOWN
AT THE ADVICE OF THE NECROMANCER I AGAIN DEMANDED TO BE REUNITED WITH ANGELICA
WE ARE THE LAST THING THEYRE THINKING OF. AT THESE WORDS HAVING MADE THEM BOTH WELL OUT I LEAPED FROM THE WINDOW AND TOOK LUIGI BY THE CAPE
THIS INCREASED HER ANIMOSITY AGAINST ME AND LED TO AN ATTACK UPON MY LIFE OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK IN THE PROPER TIME AND PLACE
GIOVIO BROUGHT HIM TO ROME WHERE HE WAS PATRONISED BY THE CARDINALS SALVIATI AND DE MEDICI
MY YOUNG MEN LAUGHED TOO
ALUIGI ALAMANNI WAS AT THAT TIME IN FLORENCE
AN OBJECT OF OSTENTATION RATHER THAN NECESSITY
THE KING TO KEEP THEM COMPANY BEGAN TO LAUGH AND SAID HE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SAINT PAUL HANGING ME IF HE COULD FIRST PRODUCE MY EQUAL IN THE ARTS
SHE RESTED HER LEFT ARM ON A STAGS NECK THIS ANIMAL BEING ONE OF THE KINGS EMBLEMS
BY THIS SYSTEM OF RECKONING IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HOURS VARIED WITH THE SEASON OF THE YEAR
BY WHICH SHE HINTED THAT THE MONEY SENT ME WAS NOT THE ENTIRE PAYMENT MERITED BY MY INDUSTRY AND OTHER MESSAGES WERE ADDED WORTHY OF SO COURTEOUS A LADY
CONSEQUENTLY HE DID BLOW OUT HIS CHAPS
THIS MAN HAD BEEN ENGAGED THERE WITH HIS OWN HANDS SEVERAL DAYS IN COMPANY WITH AMMANATO AND ALL HIS WORKPEOPLE
I OBEYED
IT COST THEM THREE MILES OF MARCH WHEREAS BEFORE THEY HAD BUT HALF A MILE
AT THE SAME TIME I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH LARGE COMMISSIONS
GALANTUOMO USED IRONICALLY NOTE 4
LXVII WHILE HE WAS STILL LYING ON THE GROUND AND PEOPLE WERE PREPARING TO CARRY HIM AWAY POMPEO THE JEWELLER PASSED BY
A SCULPTOR AND A MUSICIAN
IT WOULD BE TOO LONG TO NARRATE THEM ALL IN DETAIL
CONSIDER YOURSELF THEN TO BE AT HOME HERE AND AS THOUGH IN YOUR OWN FATHERS HOUSE. WHILE I STAYED AT PISA I WENT TO SEE THE CAMPO SANTO AND THERE I FOUND MANY BEAUTIFUL FRAGMENTS OF ANTIQUITY THAT IS TO SAY MARBLE SARCOPHAGI
AFTER SUPPER WAS OVER AND IT WAS PAST THE HOUR OF TWENTY-ONE I BECAME ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO TRESPIANO IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT RECOMMENCE MY WORK NEXT MORNING IN THE LOGGIA
AT LAST I CALLED OUT HEARTILY TO SET THE FURNACE GOING
SO WE WENT ON SEVERAL DAYS REPEATING THE OLD ROUND LIKE CLOCKWORK
HE HAD THE CARE OF THE CISTERN AND THE CASKS AND ALSO AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CARPENTERING
I FOR MY PART FELT NEVER MORE DISCONTENTED THAN WHEN HE CHOSE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS SCHEME AND TO TELL ME THAT IF I LIKED HE DISCERNED IN ME SUCH APTITUDES THAT I MIGHT BECOME THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
RUN AND CARRY HIM UPON YOUR BACK INTO MY ROOM HERE. WHEN I ARRIVED HE TOLD ME TO BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION AND SENT FOR THE FIRST PHYSICIANS OF ROME TO TAKE MY CASE IN HAND
THE WORD I HAVE TRANSLATED BY PAD ABOVE IS CUCINO IN THE ORIGINAL
AND EVEN IF IT WERE TO FALL AND THE POPE HIMSELF WAS UNDERNEATH THE MISCHIEF WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS YOU IMAGINE
IT HAPPENED ON ONE OCCASION THAT I HAD TO SPEAK ON BUSINESS TO HIS EXCELLENCY
BENVENUTO FOR HIS PART CAN BOAST OF SERVING AN EMPEROR LIKE ME WHO IS ABLE TO DISCERN HIS MERIT. I WENT ON AT MY GREAT PIECE IN GOLD SHOWING IT FREQUENTLY TO THE POPE WHO WAS VERY EAGER TO SEE IT AND EACH TIME EXPRESSED GREATER ADMIRATION
SO THE TWO BEASTS HUMAN AND EQUINE PLUNGED TOGETHER INTO A DEEP WIDE POOL WHERE BOTH OF THEM WENT DOWN BELOW THE WATER
CI BANDINELLO HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION OF THE CRUCIFIX WHICH AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE I WAS NOW ENGAGED UPON
THE GREATER PART OF THEM RATED THE CAPTAIN TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG THAT I WAS A MAN TO GIVE HIM BACK AS GOOD AS I GOT AND THAT IF THIS CAME TO THE DUKES EARS IT WOULD BE THE WORSE FOR HIM
2 HE RECEIVED ME WITH MARKS OF THE WARMEST AFFECTION WHICH COULD BE BESTOWED ON ANY MAN
SO I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD PARTAKE OF NOTHING HE BROUGHT ME UNLESS HE TASTED IT BEFORE MY EYES
WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE BEING MADE A ROMAN GENTLEMAN APPEARED WHO BELONGED TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF CARDINAL DE MEDICI AND HAD BEEN SENT BY HIM
THE MONUMENT ERECTED TO PIERO DE MEDICI DROWNED IN THE GARIGLIANO 1504 AT MONTE CASSINO IS BY NO MEANS A BRILLIANT PIECE OF FLORENTINE ART
PAGOLO RECOVERED AS I HAVE SAID WITH EASE
ON SAYING THAT LAST WORD I FELL INTO A TERRIBLE SWOON AND SEEMED TO BE SINKING DOWN INTO THE BOAT
I SEEING THAT THE AFFAIR WAS TURNING OUT WELL FOR ME RAN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND CAME OFF WITH HONOUR FROM THE ENGAGEMENT NOT WISHING TO TEMPT FORTUNE MORE THAN WAS MY DUTY
1 NOW MAY GOD ASSIST ME. I PLACED THE STATUE AND HAVING ARRANGED IT AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE WAITED FOR THE COMING OF THE KING
AND AS I SUBSEQUENTLY HEARD SHOWED IT TO TOBBIA THE GOLD-SMITH WHO BESTOWED MUCH PRAISE UPON IT
AND THESE WERE WORN IN THE CAP
ACCORDINGLY I QUICKLY TRAVERSED THAT SHORT SPACE WRAPPED IN MY CAPE WHICH I HAD TIGHTENED ROUND ME AND CAME UP WITH MAFFIO WHOM I SHOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE MURDERED FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE ROUND AND I HAD WOUND MY WAY AMONG THEM
AND HE BEING IN WANT OF PROPER CLOTHES SOUGHT OUT OUR SISTERS WHO UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND DOUBLET OF MINE BOTH NEW AND OF GOOD QUALITY
THE POPE EXPRESSED HIGH SATISFACTION AT THESE WORDS AND TURNING TO ME SAID
MEANWHILE SINCE IT WAS A LITTLE PAST THE HOUR OF TWENTY-TWO TRIBOLO AND I WENT TO SEE THE DUKE OF FERRARA COME BACK FROM BELFIORE WHERE HE HAD BEEN AT A JOUSTING MATCH
THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE AND THAT MACE-BEARERS OFFICE BROUGHT ME IN LITTLE LESS THAN 200 CROWNS A YEAR
HAVING ACHIEVED THIS FEAT I WAS ENTREATED WITH PRODIGIOUS FAVOURS BY ALL THE MEN OF QUALITY WHO WERE INVESTED IN THE CASTLE
NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT. AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
GABRIEL HOLDS THE LILY IN ITALIAN PAINTINGS WHEN HE SALUTES THE VIRGIN MARY WITH AVE VIRGO NOTE 6
THE GOVERNOR RETURNED SENT FOR ME INTO HIS CABINET AND CASTING ONE OF HIS CATCHPOLES GLANCES BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
THERE WAS A GLORIOUS HEAVEN OF STARS WHICH SHED GOOD LIGHT TO SEE BY
COSIMOS AUDITORE 1539
WHEN THIS DELICATE OPERATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED I BEGAN TO BANK IT UP WITH THE EARTH I HAD EXCAVATED
GIOVANNI SARDELLA HAD REPORTED THESE WORDS TO ME
THE MISERLY OFFICIAL FOUND A STONE RISING A TRIFLE ABOVE SIXTY CROWNS AND LET IT BE HEARD THAT IT WAS WORTH UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED
AND ON MY ARRIVAL HE CRIED OUT
BUT THOSE WHO BEST DESERVED IT LEAST I SPIED
THE OFFICE OF THE PIOMBO IN ROME WAS A BUREAU IN WHICH LEADEN SEALS WERE APPENDED TO BULLS AND INSTRUMENTS OF STATE
2 MY COIN WAS TWICE AS MUCH AS HIS
ALACK THAT I SO LITTLE CAN REVEAL
IF ANY ONE IN THIS HOUSE HAD THE AUDACITY TO ATTEMPT ANYTHING OF THE SORT AND I WERE TO BECOME AWARE OF IT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD KILL BOTH HER AND HIM
AND FORASMUCH AS SOME ENEMY MUST HAVE SERVED ME THIS BAD TURN THROUGH ENVY LET HIM WAIT TILL I GET WELL
BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM MESSER ALFONSO YOU SHALL SEE IT WITHOUT EMPLOYING THE DUKES INFLUENCE. ON HEARING THESE WORDS I TOOK MY LEAVE AND LEFT ASCANIO AND PAGOLO TO SHOW IT
NOW BEWARE OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
SO THIS PRINTER WAS PIERRE SAUTHIER
AT PRESENT I NEED ONLY SAY THAT I DEVOTED MYSELF WITH SUSTAINED DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY TO ACQUIRING MASTERY IN THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF ART WHICH I ENUMERATED A SHORT WHILE BACK
HER GO-BETWEEN OF A MOTHER IS HERE WHO DESERVES TO BE BURNED FOR EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER OFFENCE
WHEN HE SAW ME IN THE HOSTELRY HE ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAID HE WAS GOING ON BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE TO LYONS AND ENTREATED MET TO LEND HIM MONEY FOR THE JOURNEY
AFTER THIS I RECOVERED STRENGTH
HE SAID THAT HE HAD CONFESSED AND ABSOLVED ME
SON OF GIULIANO GUIDI AND COSTANZA A DAUGHTER OF DOMENICO GHIRLANDAJO
ONCE MORE I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN A SOJOURNER IN THIS MARVELLOUS CITY ROME FOR NIGH ON TWENTY YEARS AND HERE I HAVE EXERCISED MY ART IN MATTERS OF VAST IMPORTANCE
HE WAS AN EMPTY FRIBBLER WHO KEPT PERPETUALLY LAUGHING ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL
AS FOR THE BRONZE HEADS THE PEDESTAL OF JUPITER AND OTHER SUCH-LIKE THINGS I WILL BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I CAST THOSE HEADS UPON MY OWN ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH FRENCH CLAYS OF WHICH AS A FOREIGNER I HAD NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER
ORAZIO BAGLIONI OF THE SEMI-PRINCELY PERUGIAN FAMILY WAS A DISTINGUISHED CONDOTTIERE
AT THE END OF TWO YEARS UPON MY FATHERS ENTREATY I RETURNED TO FLORENCE AND PUT MYSELF ONCE MORE UNDER FRANCESCO SALIMBENE WITH WHOM I EARNED A GREAT DEAL AND TOOK CONTINUAL PAINS TO IMPROVE IN MY ART
I LORO OPERAI NOTE 2
I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. ON THIS THE POPE IN A FURY ORDERED THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS IN THE PRESENCE TO TAKE AND HANG ME AT ONCE IN THE PLACE WHERE THE HOMICIDE HAD BEEN COMMITTED ADDING THAT HE MUST DO ALL HE COULD TO CATCH ME AND NOT APPEAR AGAIN BEFORE HIM UNTIL HE HAD HANGED ME
2 WHEN I HAD BLOCKED THE WHOLE OF MINE OUT WELL AND WANTED TO BEGIN UPON THE DETAILS OF THE HEAD WHICH I HAD ALREADY JUST SKETCHED OUT IN OUTLINE THE DUKE CAME DOWN FROM THE PALACE AND GIORGETTO THE PAINTER 3 TOOK HIM INTO AMMANATOS WORKSHED
AND FEDERIGO IN CONCERT WITH BUGIARDINI AGREED THAT I SHOULD WORK UPON MY MODEL
ONE DAY WHILE HE WAS TALKING WITH ME HE NOTICED SOMETHING GOING FORWARD IN A DRINKING-PLACE OUTSIDE THE PORTA DI CASTELLO WHICH BORE THE NAME OF BACCANELLO
SO WE WENT WITH ONE OF THE STOUTEST FELLOWS IN OUR COMPANY
ONOFRIO DE BARTOLINI WAS MADE ARCHBISHOP OF PISA IN 1518 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN
HE TRANSLATED THE DECAMERON AT HER INSTANCE INTO FRENCH
AND WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HIS FEATURES WERE MORE DISCOMPOSED THAT I THOUGHT REASONABLE
FOR IF HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME BEFORE THOSE WRETCHES HE EITHER CALLED ME OR BECKONED TO ME TO ADVANCE
GO THY WAYS THIS TIME BENVENUTO
TELL HIM I ACCEPT HIS OFFER
SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE
THE SPIRIT OF HONOURABLE RIVALRY IMPELLED ME TO ATTEMPT SOME OTHER MASTERPIECE WHICH SHOULD EQUAL OR EVEN SURPASS THE PRODUCTIONS OF THAT ABLE CRAFTSMAN LUCAGNOLO WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED
WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THE RAVINGS OF MY SICKNESS HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AGAINST ME
ON ENTERING THE HOUSE I FOUND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE THERE TO WHOM WHILE WE WERE SUPPING TOGETHER I RELATED THE ADVENTURES OF THE DAYS CHASE AND THE DIABOLICAL APPARITION OF THE FIERY BEAM WHICH WE HAD SEEN
THEREFORE I LEAVE THE CHOICE TO YOU WHO WILL HAVE TO EXECUTE THE WORK. I REPLIED AS FOLLOWS
HIS MISTRESS MADAME DETAMPES BEING WITH HIM THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF FONTAINEBLEAU
LXIV IT HAPPENED THROUGH A VARIETY OF SINGULAR ACCIDENTS THAT I BECAME INTIMATE WITH A SICILIAN PRIEST WHO WAS A MAN OF VERY ELEVATED GENIUS AND WELL INSTRUCTED IN BOTH LATIN AND GREEK LETTERS
BUT WHEN I FOUND HE DID NOT STIR A FINGER IN HIS OWN DEFENCE I BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT
I BOUGHT HALF OF THE FARM DEL POGGIO FROM THEM OR RATHER FROM SBIETTA FOR TWO HUNDRED CROWNS
GIOVANNI DE MEDICI SURNAMED DELLE BANDE NERE
HE WAS A NOBLEMAN OF VENICE
1 ON ENTERING I PAID HIM MARKED RESPECT AND HE RECEIVED ME WITH THE GREATEST STIFFNESS
I HAD ON HAND THE FOLLOWING WORKS ALREADY MENTIONED NAMELY THE SILVER JUPITER THE GOLDEN SALT-CELLAR THE GREAT SILVER VASE AND THE TWO BRONZE HEADS
THE POPE SAID
BEATRICE BROUGHT HIM THAT COOLER FULL OF WATER AND HE HAS DRUNK ALMOST THE WHOLE OF IT
ON HEARING THIS NARRATION THE DUCHESS SAID
THE RESULT OF THIS CASTING GREATLY PLEASED HIS EXCELLENCY WHO OFTEN CAME TO MY HOUSE TO INSPECT IT ENCOURAGING ME BY THE INTEREST HE SHOWED TO DO MY BEST
AND THIS HE DID FOR SEVERAL DAYS
THIS IS LIKE RUNNING THE GAUNTLET
I AM NOT ASTONISHED AT IT BECAUSE MOST LIBERALLY HAVE YOU SQUANDERED ALL YOUR PROPERTY WITHOUT REFLECTING THAT YOUR CHILDREN HAD NEED OF IT
THE YOUNG MEN WERE BUT FOUR AND ALL FOUR OF THEM WITHOUT A BEARD
THE FEMALE BROUGHT BY GIULIO ASKED WHETHER SHE FELT INDISPOSED
IN THIS WAY I BROUGHT HIM ROUND AND HE GAVE ME ORDERS TO CONSTRUCT THE MODELS
UN TESSUTO DI GELSUMINI NATURALI E BELLISSIMI
ON ONE OCCASION IT HAPPENED THAT THE GALLOWS BIRD BERNARDONE THE BROKER WAS PRESENT AT THESE CONVERSATIONS AND IN SUPPORT OF BANDINELLOS CALUMNIES HE SAID TO THE DUKE
IN LITTLE MORE THAN TWO HOURS I FINISHED WHAT WAS WANTED FOR HIS WAXEN MEDAL
LIT THE LARGEST PIECE LEFT OF ME SHOULD BE MY EARS. NOTE 3
THE TWO OLD MEN WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CAST MY JUPITER POSTPONED THE EXPERIMENT SAYING THEY WOULD LIKE TO ARRANGE THE MOULDS OF MY TWO HEADS
THIS WAS THE CARDINAL ALESSANDRO SON OF PIER LUIGI FARNESE
I COLLECTED THEM AND TOOK THEM TO THE WINDOW WHICH LET A FLOOD OF LIGHT INTO THE ROOM
WE BOTH LAUGHED PLEASANTLY AT THIS AND SHE GAVE ME OTHER COMMISSIONS FOR FINE AND SUBSTANTIAL WORK
WHEREUPON HIS HOLINESS SENT THREE TIMES ON THAT DAY TO SEE IF THE RING WAS FINISHED
ANTONIO SON OF VITTORIO LANDI WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN GETTING THE DUKE TO PURCHASE IT
1 THE FELLOW IN QUESTION INFORMED ONE OF SIGNOR PIER LUIGIS SECRETARIES THAT HAVING BEEN WITH ME AS WORKMAN SEVERAL YEARS HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH ALL MY AFFAIRS ON THE STRENGTH OF WHICH HE GAVE HIS WORD TO SIGNOR PIER LUIGI THAT I WAS WORTH MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND DUCATS AND THAT THE GREATER PART OF THIS PROPERTY CONSISTED IN JEWELS WHICH JEWELS BELONGED TO THE CHURCH AND THAT I HAD STOLEN THEM IN CASTEL SANT ANGELO DURING THE SACK OF ROME AND THAT ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS TO CATCH ME ON THE SPOT WITH SECRECY
FOR THOUGH PEOPLE ACCUSED ME OF WANTING TO CARRY THEM INTO ITALY EVERYBODY KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPORT MONEY GOLD OR SILVER FROM FRANCE WITHOUT SPECIAL LICENSE
ANGELO DURING THE PAPAL GOVERNMENT OF ROME
ON HEARING THIS I WENT OFF TO THE DUKE AT ONCE WHO DISPLAYED SOME IRRITATION WHEN HE SAW ME
AT FIRST MY QUESTION MADE HIM LAUGH
BUT WE HAVE NO RECORD OF HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE OFFICE OF GONFALONIER
ACCORDINGLY AT TWENTY-THREE I LEFT IN THE POST FOR FLORENCE
IT CHANCED AT THAT TIME THAT I LIGHTED UPON SOME JARS OR LITTLE ANTIQUE URNS FILLED WITH ASHES AND AMONG THE ASHES WERE SOME IRON RINGS INLAID WITH GOLD FOR THE ANCIENTS ALSO USED THAT ART AND IN EACH OF THE RINGS WAS SET A TINY CAMEO OF SHELL
NOW LET US GO TO SUCCOUR HIM WHO MUST DIE SHORTLY. ACCORDINGLY WE TURNED AND WENT BACK TO MY BROTHER WHOM I HAD AT ONCE CONVEYED INTO A HOUSE
THE STORM RAGED FOR SOME WHILE BUT AT LAST IT STOPPED
HE CAME ON PURPOSE TO MY HOUSE AND TOOK ME ALL ROUND THE CITY
YOUR LEGS BEEN BROKEN
ADMIRAL OF FRANCE IN 1543
AND YET BOLOGNA HAD AT THIS TIME PRODUCED NEITHER DESIGNS NOR MODELS FOR THE FOUNTAIN
BUT HAVING TO SHOOT SIDEWAYS I COULD NOT DO THE DAMAGE THAT I WISHED ALTHOUGH I KILLED A FAIR PERCENTAGE EVERY DAY
SUCH WAS ITS BEAUTY AND THE SKILL OF ITS WORKMANSHIP THAT OUR GREAT MICHEL AGNOLO PROTESTED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO WONDERFUL
NOW TO RETURN UNTO MY PRIMAL THOUGHT
HOWEVER WE SETTLED OUR BUSINESS IN A FEW WORDS
THE WORD CONFINI WHICH I HAVE TRANSLATED BOUNDARIES MAY MEAN LIMITING CONDITIONS CIII MEANWHILE I DID NOT SUSPEND MY LABOURS ON THE NEPTUNE WHICH WAS NOW QUITE BLOCKED OUT UPON AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM UNDISCOVERED AND UNKNOWN BEFORE I USED IT
AFTER I HAD NARRATED ALL THE DEVILRIES OF THAT DREADFUL SACK AND HAD GIVEN HIM A GOOD QUANTITY OF CROWNS WHICH I HAD GAINED BY MY SOLDIERING AND WHEN WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR TOKENS OF AFFECTION HE WENT OFF TO THE EIGHT TO REDEEM MY BAN
I AM LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE AND WHEN IT FALLS DUE I SHALL PAY YOU YOUR RENT
CLOSE TO THE NAME I HAD THE COAT OF US CELLINI CARVED UPON THE STONE ALTERING IT IN SOME PARTICULARS
FRANCESCO I FORESEE THAT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS WILL HAPPEN
THE STATUE WHICH MAY STILL BE SEEN UPON THE GREAT PIAZZA IS IN TRUTH A VERY POOR PERFORMANCE
THEY BEGAN TO SCREAM AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
STILL I DID NOT ON THIS ACCOUNT NEGLECT MY OWN FINE ART OF JEWELLERY
HAS FIGI
THE FLORENTINES WERE ANGRY BECAUSE BANDINELLO HAD FILCHED THE COMMISSION AWAY FROM MICHEL ANGELO
GO AND TELL THE CARDINAL THAT I WAS ACTING AT THE ORDER OF SUPERIOR OFFICERS AND THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND ARE DOING IS IN DEFENCE OF THEM PRIESTS 3 AND NOT TO HURT THEM. THEY MADE AWAY
POMONA ANSWERED YES SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS A MONTH OR SO WITH A CHILD
BEFORE MY CASTELLAN DIES I WILL LET HIM PUT THAT BENVENUTO TO DEATH IN ANY WAY HE LIKES FOR HE IS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH AND SO THE GOOD MAN SHALL NOT DIE UNREVENGED. ON HEARING THESE WORDS FROM THE MOUTH OF DUKE PIER LUIGI THE CASTELLAN REPLIED
HE WAS A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE TALENT DISTINGUISHED BY HIS PLEASANTRIES AND STRIKING CONVERSATION AND HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A DESIGNER OF PATTERNS FOR THE CLOTH-WEAVERS IN FLORENCE
4 THAT RIGHT WORTHY FELLOW CAME DAILY TO VISIT ME AND ALWAYS GAVE ME SOME KINDLY WORD WHICH I RETURNED
SEE YOU ANTONIO THAT IT WAS GOD WHO KNEW WHAT HAD TO HAPPEN TO MY SON AND NOT YOURSELF? TO WHICH THE FELLOW ANSWERED
AND WHOSO ACTS AGAINST THYSELF ACTS AGAINST MYSELF. THE MILANESE NOBLEMAN WENT BACK MUCH DISCONCERTED WHILE THE BISHOP OF FRULLI COME TO VISIT ME AT CARDINAL CORNAROS PALACE
IT WAS JUST UPON DAYBREAK WHEN THE FRESH BREEZE WHICH BLOWS AN HOUR BEFORE THE SUN REVIVED ME
THE POPE SWELLING WITH RAGE AND GRUMBLING REMAINED REVOLVING WHAT HIS SON HAD TOLD HIM
AFTER A FEW DAYS WHEN THE WOUNDS OF LUIGI AND THE STRUMPET AND THE REST WERE HEALING THIS GREAT NEAPOLITAN NOBLEMAN RECEIVED OVERTURES FROM MESSER BENVEGNATO
XXI ON THE DAY FOLLOWING MADONNA PORZIA SENT A MAJOR-DOMO OF HERS TO MY SHOP WHO CALLED ME OUT AND PUTTING INTO MY HANDS A PAPER PACKET FULL OF MONEY FROM HIS LADY TOLD ME THAT SHE DID NOT CHOOSE THE DEVIL SHOULD HAVE HIS WHOLE LAUGH OUT
I ENJOYED IT EXTREMELY
THE WHOLE COMPANY OF ATTENDANTS THEREFORE QUAKED WITH FEAR FOR ME
WHEN I HAD SECURED THE DOG HE PROCEEDED TO RESTORE THE GOLD AND SILVER AND THE RINGS WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM ME AND TWENTY-FIVE CROWNS IN ADDITION
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME I PERCEIVED THAT I HAD ACTED VERY WRONGLY
ASCANIO TOO ALTHOUGH HE WAS BUT A STRIPLING WAS IN THE HABIT OF WEARING ONE
THE CARDINAL IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR ME BEFORE SIGNOR PIER LUIGI COULD GET WIND OF THE AFFAIR
I PUT MOREOVER INTO THE SAME FRIEZE FOUR OTHER FIGURES SIMILAR IN SIZE AND INTENDED FOR THE FOUR CHIEF WINDS
THEN I BETOOK ME TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD DONE PRECISELY AS HIS MAJESTY HAD ORDERED BY DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST EVERY ONE WHO SOUGHT TO HINDER ME IN HIS SERVICE
MY FATHER SHOWED ME A SHIELD AS OURS WHICH HAD THE PAW ONLY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER BEARINGS
AT LAST I RESOLVED TO PUT MY THINGS AND MY COMRADES ON BOARD THE BOAT
COME IN FRIEND BENVENUTO
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SAFE FROM RECAPTURE BY THE POPE IF I COULD HAVE STAYED THERE
XI THIS LETTER FELL INTO THE HANDS OF MY MASTER ULIVIERI AND HE READ IT UNKNOWN TO ME
AND FOR MY PART I TOO OUGHT TO STUDY THE TEMPER OF HIS MAJESTY AS MY DUTY REQUIRED
HE HATH GONE UP TO HEAVEN WHO WAS THE CHIEF OF MEN RENOWNED IN ARTS IMMORTAL SPHERES
GO AND SAY THIS TO THE POPE
AND THIS WAS THE CHIEF REASON WHY I HAD NOT CARRIED OUT MY WORK
I KISSED HIS FEET AND THEN AS HUMBLY AS I COULD DREW NEAR TO HIM AND LET HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE TO UTTER
THIS VERSION OF THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL TIME WAS TRANSLATED BY JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS 1840-1893 CELLINI LIVED FROM 1500-1571
AND MY WORK HAS BEEN RECEIVED WITH WARMER PRAISES THAN ANY OTHER HERETOFORE EXPOSED BEFORE THE GAZE OF OUR INCOMPARABLE MASTERS
TO THIS HE ANSWERED
FOR A NUMBER OF HONEST FOLK CITIZENS OF FLORENCE AND OTHERS OF THEM COURTIERS CAME RUNNING UP
YOU LITTLE SCOUNDREL
I THOUGHT TO FIND IN HIM ONE OF THE SINCEREST FRIENDS I HAD IN THE WORLD SEEING THAT IN ROME I HAD DONE HIM THE GREATEST BENEFITS WHICH ONE MAN CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER
1 GET UP FROM THERE AND BEGONE AT ONCE FOR TO-MORROW WE SHALL SEND YOUR SON INTO THE COUNTRY WITH THE LANCES. 2 MY POOR FATHER HAD STILL THE SPIRIT TO ANSWER
AND WHILE I WAS FOLLOWING THIS CURE I WENT ON ALWAYS WORKING AT THE MODELS OF THE CHALICE
STAVANO ALLE VELETTE PERHAPS LAY IN WAIT FOR XXVIII AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE THE PLAGUE HAD BROKEN OUT IN ROME
WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING MESSER GIOVANNI HAD ORDERED DINNER AND WE ALL OF US SAT DOWN TO EAT IN COMPANY
NOW I HAD HOPED NOT ONLY TO GAIN SOME HANDSOME REWARD TRUSTING TO THE MIGHTY SIGNS OF KINDNESS SHOWN ME BY THE DUKE BUT I HAD STILL MORE EXPECTED TO SECURE THE ENTIRE GOOD GRACES OF HIS EXCELLENCY SEEING I NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING BUT ONLY FOR HIS FAVOUR
THEREFORE DO THE UTMOST THAT YOU CAN. THE GOVERNOR REJOINED
1 AND ON MY PRESENTING MYSELF TO HER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY SHE ASKED ME TO SET A LITTLE POINT-DIAMOND IN A RING SAYING SHE WISHED ALWAYS TO WEAR IT
THIS IS NO BLAME TO BANDINELLO WHO HAS FOUNDED THE HONOUR OF THE FAMILY-IF ONLY HE HAD DONE SO HONESTLY
LATTANZIO BROUGHT STONE SAND AND LIME AND PROVIDED WHAT I WANTED SAYING HE DID SO AT YOUR LORDSHIPS ORDERS. WHEN I HAD THUS SPOKEN THE BRUTE TURNED UPON ME WITH STILL GREATER TARTNESS VOWING THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY OF THOSE WHOM I HAD MENTIONED SPOKE THE TRUTH
AMONG THE FLAMES OF THE THUNDERBOLT I HAD VERY CLEVERLY INTRODUCED A TORCH OF WHITE WAX
HE WENT TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE POPE AND THE POPE DETAINED HIM UP TO SUPPER-TIME
SEE VARCHIS STORIA FIORENTINA LIB
BUT THEY OUGHT NOT TO ATTEMPT SO FINE AN ENTERPRISE TILL THEY HAVE PASSED THE AGE OF FORTY
THE FIRST AND THE MORE DISTINGUISHED HE TOOK WITH HIM FOLLOWING THE ROUTE OF ROMAGNA WITH THE OBJECT OF VISITING MADONNA DEL LORETO AND THEN MAKING FOR FERRARA HIS OWN HOME
THEY WERE TWENTY-FIVE CROWNS IN GIULIOS
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENVENUTO CELLINI TRANSLATED BY JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES VOLUME 31
TOWARD TWO HOURS AFTER SUNSET I WALKED ALONG PANTASILEAS LODGING WITH THE INTENTION IF LUIGI PULCI WERE THERE OF DOING SOMETHING TO THE DISCONTENT OF BOTH
THE POPE WHO WAS EXPECTING NOTHING OF THIS KIND DERIVED GREAT PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT FROM THE SIGHT BOTH BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM IMPOSSIBLE THAT ONE SHOULD AIM AND HIT THE MARK AT SUCH A DISTANCE AND ALSO BECAUSE THE MAN WAS CUT IN TWO AND HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW THIS SHOULD HAPPEN
I HAVE HEARD WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY
IF YOU DONT TAKE YOURSELF OFF NOW AT THIS FIRST WORD I UTTER I WILL BRING MY SWORD HERE DOWN UPON YOUR HEAD. OVERWHELMED WITH FRIGHT MY POOR GOSSIP WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN ILL WITH THE COLIC AND WITHDREW TO EASE HIMSELF APART
THE SEA CARRIED A TRIDENT IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND IN HIS LEFT I PUT A SHIP OF DELICATE WORKMANSHIP TO HOLD THE SALT
AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO ME
IT IS FIFTEEN MILES LONG WHEN ONE REACHES VESSA
THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT I SHOULD SUCCEED IN MY WORK ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE
THE KING NOTICED HOW ANGRY SHE WAS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO FORCE SOME WORDS OUT IN MY FURY
NOW I WISH HIM TO KNOW MY OBJECT IN SENDING THOSE LETTERS OF NATURALISATION
I DID SO WITH STILL GREATER HEAT AND SPIRIT ADDING I HAD NO FARTHER MIND TO SERVE THE DUKE AND THAT I SHOULD RETURN TO FRANCE WHERE I WAS ALWAYS WELCOME
BUT IF YOU DO MAY YOU BE EVER BLESSED BY ME! WHEN I WOKE I RAN FOR VERY FRIGHT TO HAVE MYSELF INSCRIBED
OF A SURETY THE DUKE OUGHT ONLY TOO WELL TO KNOW THAT THIS BANDINELLO OF HIS IS WORTH NOTHING. NOTE 1
1 IT WAS ABOUT HALF A CUBIT IN SIZE AND WAS SO CONSTRUCTED AS TO SERVE FOR A SALT-CELLAR AT TABLE
THEY HELD THE DAGGER IN THEIR HAND AND WERE RELATING HOW THE MATTER HAPPENED AND THE GREAT TROUBLE THEY HAD TO PULL THE WEAPON FROM THE NECK AND HEAD-BONE OF THE MAN WHOSE NAME THEY DID NOT KNOW
AND SEVERAL TIMES BACCINO DELLA CROCE CAME FROM HIM TO TELL ME THAT I MUST NOT NEGLECT THE RELIQUARY
THEN SOFTENING STILL MORE IN MANNER HE BEGAN TO QUESTION ME CONCERNING VENICE AND AFTER THIS WISE WE CONVERSED SOME SPACE OF TIME
HIS SONS WITH OTHER FOLK WERE GETTING READY FOR ATTACK AND WE MUST ALMOST CERTAINLY BE CUT TO PIECES
WHEN THEREFORE MAESTRO GIACOMO HAD MADE HIS TALENTS KNOWN HE PROFESSED TO WORK MIRACLES IN THE TREATMENT OF SUCH CASES BY MEANS OF CERTAIN FUMIGATIONS
THIS MAN WAS CALLED BASTIANO CENNINI AN ARTIST OF THE ANTIQUATED SCHOOL AND OF LITTLE SKILL IN HIS CRAFT
HIS JEALOUSY OF HIS COUSIN ALESSANDRO LED TO HIS UNTIMELY DEATH BY POISON IN 1535
NOTICING THAT THE DUKE TOOK PLEASURE IN SEEING ME AT WORK AND TALKING WITH ME I TOOK IT INTO MY HEAD TO GO THERE SOMETIMES ALSO BY DAY
HE SPENDS FREELY IS A BOON COMPANION AND WORKS HARD
THEY INSISTED ON HEARING THE WHOLE STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM MY APPRENTICE CENCIO WHO WAS A YOUTH OF SUPERLATIVE TALENT BRAVERY AND EXTREME PERSONAL BEAUTY
THIS MADE STUPID PEOPLE SAY THAT THE GHOST HAD GOT INTO THE BODY OF THE FIGURE AND WAS SETTING ITS EYES IN MOTION AND ITS MOUTH AS THOUGH IT WERE ABOUT TO TALK
AND IT IS THIS-I WANT HIM TO COME IN THOSE VERY CLOTHES TO SUPPER WITH THE COMPANY OF ARTISTS WHEREOF HE HAS OFTEN HEARD ME SPEAK. THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS HONEST VIRTUOUS AND WISE CHECKED HIS ENTHUSIASM BENT HIS EYES TO THE GROUND AND STOOD FOR A SHORT WHILE IN SILENCE
HE COULD NOT HOWEVER PUT FORCE UPON THE INCLINATIONS OF OUR NATURE WHICH DIRECTED ME TO THE ARTS OF DESIGN AND MY BROTHER WHO HAD A FINE AND GRACEFUL PERSON TO THE PROFESSION OF ARMS
FOLK ATTRIBUTED HIS IMPOTENT CONDUCT PARTLY TO A NATURAL SLUGGISHNESS IN WARFARE AND PARTLY TO HIS HATRED FOR THE HOUSE OF MEDICI
LXXIV IT WAS AS MUCH AS THE DUKE COULD DO TO STAND BY AND LISTEN TO MY PLEADINGS
2 I WAS CALLED IN AGAIN
PETER WITH THIS INSCRIPTION QUARE DUBITASTI MY DESIGN WON SUCH APPLAUSE THAT A CERTAIN SECRETARY OF THE POPE A MAN OF THE GREATEST TALENT CALLED IL SANGA 7 WAS MOVED TO THIS REMARK
SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED
SO FELICE DREW NEAR TO THE BED
THEY POINTED OUT TO US THE PLANT IN QUESTION OF WHICH THE HEDGES WERE FULL
HOWEVER I WENT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WITHOUT CORNAROS KNOWLEDGE AND UNDER GOOD ESCORT TO PAY HIM MY RESPECTS
IF YOU ARE SATISFIED TO HAVE IT THUS SO ALSO AM I; AND TURNING TO PAGOLO AND ASCANIO I SAID
I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING
AT THE SAME TIME HE LEFT ME FREE TO EXECUTE THEM AS I LIKED
WE BOTH WENT DOWN TOGETHER AND WHEN WE REACHED THE PRESENCE OF THE EMPEROR THE HORSES MADE THEIR ENTRANCE THROUGH THOSE HALLS WITH SO MUCH SPIRIT AND SUCH A NOBLE CARRIAGE THAT THE EMPEROR AND EVERY ONE WERE STRUCK WITH WONDER
I MEANWHILE HAD ALREADY UNCOVERED MY PIECE
1 THIS VILLEROIS WAS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE PROVOST TO WHOM THE CASTLE HAD BEEN GIVEN
2 AND WHEN CISTI CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE WHISPERED
THEN I MADE HASTE TO PASS AN EXCELLENT COAT OF MAIL OVER MY SHIRT AND ABOVE THAT SOME CLOTHES WHICH I CAUGHT UP AT RANDOM
BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE DUKE FELL ILL OF A SERIOUS MALADY REMAINING FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WITHOUT PASSING WATER
LET HIM BE WELCOME. ALL THE PERSONS WHO WERE THERE ASKED HIM JOYFULLY WHAT NAME THE CHILD SHOULD BEAR
BOTH SHE AND LUIGI GROVELLED ON THE GROUND WHILE BACHIACCA WITH HIS BREECHES DOWN TO HEELS SCREAMED OUT AND RAN AWAY
THE FELLOW CAME TO VISIT ME IN THE PLACE OF BY RETIREMENT
I WENT WITH THREE HUNDRED COMRADES IN THE TRAIN OF SIGNOR ORAZIO BAGLIONI TOWARD PERUGIA
FIRST I SHOULD BE ILL SERVED IN THE MINT WHICH CONCERNS ME GREATLY
WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING I HAD HALF DRAWN MY SWORD FROM THE SHEATH WHEN BERLINGHIER BERLINGHIERI A YOUNG MAN OF THE GREATEST DARING AND MY GOOD FRIEND THREW HIMSELF FROM BEHIND UPON MY ARMS
GIACOMO BERENGARIO DA CARPI WAS IN FACT A GREAT PHYSICIAN SURGEON AND STUDENT OF ANATOMY
WHILE REPEATING THE WORDS WHICH HE HAD SAID TO HIM CONCERNING HIS RUIN NO SOONER HAD THEY ESCAPED HIS LIPS THAN THE FLOOR WHERE HE WAS STANDING EITHER BECAUSE THE VAULT HAD BEEN BADLY BUILT OR RATHER THROUGH THE SHEER MIGHTINESS OF GOD WHO DOES NOT ALWAYS PAY ON SATURDAY SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
WHEN I LEFT HIS MAJESTY I WENT FOR THE TWO NOTARIES WHO HAD HELPED ME IN PROCURING SILVER FOR THE JUPITER AND MANY OTHER THINGS
LET THEN THIS LESSON TEACH YOU ANOTHER TIME TO WORK AND NOT TO POKE FUN AT YOUR MASTERS. NOTE 1
ON ONE OCCASION WHEN TWO GENTLEMEN WERE PUSHING THEIR WAY IN AS SPECTATORS AND THE PORTER WAS OPPOSING THEM WITH VIOLENCE THE JUDGE RAISED HIS VOICE AND SPOKE THE FOLLOWING WORDS PRECISELY AS I HEARD THEM
MILIANOS FOIL SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND TO DO THAT BENVENUTO YOU SHALL DOFF YOUR CAP
2 NO MOST BLESSED FATHER BECAUSE HE HAS NOT AS YET HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
WHEREFORE THE DUKE CAME TALKING PLEASANTLY WITH THE DUCHESS ABOUT MY DOINGS
GO TO YOUR AFFAIRS
THE JAILERS MUST HAVE VISITED MY CELL SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT MY TAKING NOTICE OF THEM
LEAVE IT THEN TO ME WHO DO UNDERSTAND IT, AND TURNED MY SHOULDERS TO GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS
ACCORDINGLY I SENT FOR MY PIECE AND HAVING HAD IT SEALED AS DESCRIBED GAVE IT UP TO HIM
DELIGHTED AND ASTONISHED HE WROTE ME OUT A CHEQUE 2 FOR THE TWO HUNDRED CROWNS I HAD DEMANDED
NO ENVY PROMPTED ME TO DISPUTE HIS CLAIMS BUT RATHER PITY FOR THAT POOR UNFORTUNATE PIECE OF MARBLE
LOOK YOU MY LORD
BUT KEPT UPON MY GUARD AND SLACKENING PACE A LITTLE DREW NEARER TOWARD THE WALL IN ORDER TO GIVE THE FELLOW A WIDE BERTH
LUCAGNOLO BENVENUTOS PIECES BEING ALL OF GOLD AND TWICE AS MANY AS YOURS MAKE A FAR FINER EFFECT. I THOUGHT FOR CERTAIN THAT WHAT WITH JEALOUSY AND WHAT WITH SHAME LUCAGNOLO WOULD HAVE FALLEN DEAD UPON THE SPOT
THIS PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO CHARGE MY GUN WITH A NOISELESS KIND OF POWDER
THERETO HE ADDED
LONG LIVE THE GENTLEMAN! AND ADDED THAT THIS WAS THE PUNISHMENT I DESERVED FOR HAVING PLAYED SO FINE A TRICK
THIS SCULPTOR CAME TO ROME WITH HIS COMPATRIOT BALDASSARE PERUZZI AND WAS EMPLOYED UPON THE MONUMENT OF POPE ADRIAN VI WHICH HE EXECUTED WITH SOME HELP FROM TRIBOLO
NOW I MUST MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE WOMAN IS MINE AND YOU MAY TAKE THE DOWRY FOR YOURSELF. AT THIS ANDREA CELLINI WHO WAS A MAN OF RATHER AWKWARD TEMPER GREW A TRIFLE ANGRY
VII WHILE I WAS STILL ENGAGED UPON THE REVERSE OF THIS MEDAL THE CARDINAL SENT ME LETTERS BIDDING ME PREPARE FOR MY JOURNEY SINCE THE KING HAD ASKED AFTER ME
IN MY LETTERS TO THEM I BOASTED OF THE DISTINGUISHED KINDNESS SHOWN ME IN MY OWN BIRTHPLACE BY A PRINCE AND PRINCESS THE ABSOLUTE MASTERS OF FLORENCE
PETER PLEADING MY CAUSE FOR THE SHAME HE FELT THAT SUCH FOUL WRONGS SHOULD BE DONE TO CHRISTIANS IN HIS OWN HOUSE
AND WHILE I WAS WORKING AT MY MODEL HE WONDERED MUCH THAT I HAD NOT APPLIED TO HIM BEING AS HE WAS A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE AND OF LARGE CREDIT WITH THE POPE
DO YOUR BEST WITH ALL DESPATCH FOR THE METAL WILL SOON BE FUSED
BUT WHEN I SAW THAT THE POOR LAD WAS PREPARING TO FOLLOW ON FOOT I ENGAGED A HORSE FOR HIM TOO PUT A SMALL VALISE UPON THE CRUPPER AND LOADED MYSELF WITH FAR MORE USELESS BAGGAGE THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN
XV I WENT ON WORKING WITH PAGOLO ARSAGO AND EARNED A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY THE GREATER PART OF WHICH I ALWAYS SENT TO MY GOOD FATHER
AND WHEN THE FIRST DAYS WORK WAS FINISHED HE TOOK ME IN THE EVENING TO HIS HOUSE WHERE HE DWELT RESPECTABLY WITH HIS HANDSOME WIFE AND CHILDREN
AT LAST I INDUCED THE WOMAN TO JOIN US
BUT THAT IF HE TRIED TO JUMP ON ME I SHOULD KILL HIM
THIS MADE THE KING WHEN HE BEHELD MINE AFFIRM THAT THE FINISH OF ITS WORKMANSHIP EXCEEDED HIS HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS
IT SANK IN THE OOZY GROUND
THE PONIARD ENTERED THIS POINT SO DEEP INTO THE BONE THAT THOUGH I USED ALL MY STRENGTH TO PULL IT OUT I WAS NOT ABLE
HE WAS DESCENDED FROM LORENZO DE MEDICI THE BROTHER OF COSIMO PATER PATRIæ AND THE UNCLE OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
AFTER ALL WAS OVER I TURNED TO A PLATE OF SALAD ON A BENCH THERE AND ATE WITH HEARTY APPETITE AND DRANK TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE CREW
SO THAT AFTER ABOUT TEN DAYS EACH HAD FINISHED HIS UNDERTAKING WITH GREAT DELICACY AND ARTISTIC SKILL
THIS FEE WAS IL QUARTO OR THE FOURTH PART OF THE CRIMINALS FINE WHICH CAME TO THE DELATOR
I SHOULD LIKE YOU FURTHERMORE TO BE AWARE MY LORD FOR CERTAIN THAT THE SOLE REASON WHY I SUCCEEDED WITH ALL THOSE GREAT ARDUOUS WORKS IN FRANCE UNDER HIS MOST ADMIRABLE MAJESTY KING FRANCIS WAS THE HIGH COURAGE WHICH THAT GOOD MONARCH PUT INTO MY HEART BY THE LIBERAL ALLOWANCES HE MADE ME AND THE MULTITUDE OF WORKPEOPLE HE LEFT AT MY DISPOSAL
GO AND TELL MONSIGNOR YOUR MASTER THAT I WANT THE MONEY FOR MY WORK BEFORE I LET IT LEAVE THIS SHOP. WHEN THE FELLOW SAW HE COULD NOT OBTAIN IT BY SWAGGERING HE FELL TO PRAYING ME AS ONE PRAYS TO THE CROSS DECLARING THAT IF I WOULD ONLY GIVE IT UP HE WOULD TAKE CARE I SHOULD BE PAID
I WANT BENVENUTO TO STAY HERE WITH ALL HIS FOLLOWERS EVEN THOUGH THEY BE A HUNDRED MEN
THEN I TOOK MY DECISION AND THREW MYSELF UPON MY KNEES SHOUTING AS LOUDLY AS I COULD FOR HE TOO HAD NOT CEASED FROM SHOUTING
ACCORDINGLY THE BLOOD SPRANG FORTH SO COPIOUSLY AND SPURTED WITH SUCH FORCE INTO HIS FACE THAT HE HAD TO ABANDON THE OPERATION
SO WHEN WE REACHED THE PLACE I MENTIONED AND HAD DINED I DREW SOME COINS FROM THE COMMON PURSE AND GAVE THEM TO THE GUIDE WHO HELPED TO DRAW HIM FROM THE WATER
THANKS TO HIM THEN I RECEIVED THE KINDEST HOSPITALITY FROM HIS FATHER AND ALL HIS FAMILY AMONG WHOM WAS AN OLD MAN OF MORE THAN SEVENTY EXTREMELY PLEASANT IN HIS CONVERSATION
5 HE DEALT IN NOTHING BUT LITTLE CHISELLED MEDALS MADE OF PLATES OF METAL AND SUCH-LIKE THINGS
ENOUGH THAT I WAS ON THE POINT OF LOSING MY WITS OR DYING
HERE ARE ALL THE CLOTHES I GAVE YOU
CIV DURING THE AGITATIONS OF THIS TIME WHICH I HAVE JUST RELATED KING FRANCIS RECEIVED NEWS OF HOW THE POPE WAS KEEPING ME IN PRISON AND WITH WHAT INJUSTICE
HE KEPT PERPETUALLY CHATTERING IN FRENCH THROUGH ALL OUR JOURNEY UP TO THE VERY PRECINCTS OF THE COURT AT ONE TIME BULLYING NOW SAYING ONE THING THEN ANOTHER TILL I FELT INCLINED TO DENY GOD AND THE WORLD
IN THAT TIME ONE OF THEIR SONS THE YOUNGER WHO WAS CALLED CRISTOFANO ROUSED A GREAT FEUD WITH CERTAIN OF THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS
AND A BEADLE USED TO CARRY ME UPON HIS SHOULDERS
THE CARDINAL HAD ME PLACED IN A SECRET CHAMBER AND WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY TO BEG ME FROM THE POPE
DISMISS THE MATTER FROM YOUR MIND AND LEAVE ME TO ACT. IF THE HEART OF THE POPE WAS ILL-DISPOSED AGAINST ME THAT OF THE CASTELLAN WAS NOW AT THE COMMENCEMENT SAVAGE AND CRUEL IN THE EXTREME
HE MADE NO ANSWER WHICH OBLIGED ME TO STAY SEVERAL DAYS KICKING MY HEELS
YET BEING UNABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE MAN I DECIDED TO PAY HIM MY RESPECTS AND ARRIVED JUST AFTER HE HAD RISEN FROM TABLE IN THE COMPANY OF THE LANDI WHO AFTERWARDS MURDERED HIM
AT THE PROPER HOUR TOWARD NIGHTFALL I HAD HIM BURIED WITH DUE CEREMONY IN THE CHURCH OF THE FLORENTINES
SO YOU MAY GO ON WITH YOUR COURTIERS NONSENSE TILL YOU HAVE NO MORE TO SAY. WITHOUT UTTERING ONE WORD HE LEFT ME IN A RAGE AND TRIED TO GET THE WORK GIVEN TO ANOTHER GOLDSMITH
WE OFTEN CAME TOGETHER
THEN I TURNED MY BACK AND HE THREATENING I GRUMBLING TOOK MY LEAVE
I VERY OFTEN SUBMITTED TO HIS EXCELLENCY THAT IF I LEFT MY PERSEUS IN THE DAYTIME SEVERAL BAD CONSEQUENCES WOULD ENSUE
THIS IS HOW I WILL MEET DEATH FOR WE ARE CERTAINLY DEAD MEN. AGAIN I SAID TO HIM
THEREFORE IF YOU ARE THE HONEST MAN I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU TELL ME NOW THE TRUTH. THEREAT I FLUSHED UP TO MY EYES WHICH AT THE SAME TIME FILLED WITH TEARS AND SAID TO HIM
HE ANSWERED AT ONCE
I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE YOU FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING YOUR MASTER. HE CONTRIVED THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD WRITE ME A NOTE INFORMING ME THAT I WAS FREE TO TAKE HIM
FOR HE MADE ANSWER TO THE KINGS ENVOY THAT HIS MAJESTY NEED PAY ME NO ATTENTION SINCE I WAS A FELLOW WHO GAVE MUCH TROUBLE BY FIGHTING
I OUGHT NOT TO JOURNEY FORWARDS FOR IF I RETURNED AT ONCE MY AFFAIRS WOULD BE MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER
THE DUKE HEARING SOMETHING OF THESE DISPUTES SENT FOR THE VASE AND THE MODELS AND NEVER TOLD ME WHY OR WHEREFORE
THE TWO GENTLEMEN WERE EAGER TO RESUME THE THREAD OF THEIR COMPLIMENTARY PROPOSALS WHEREUPON I LIFTING MY CAP AND MAKING A PROFOUND BOW BADE THEM A POLITE FAREWELL
THE BEST THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO GO BACK TO FERRARA FOR I SEE THAT THE AFFAIR IS LIKELY TO BE UGLY
MAY GOD GRANT ONLY THAT THE CARDINAL IS NOT OF ONE MIND WITH MADAME DETAMPES WHO HAS NOTHING ELSE SO MUCH AT HEART AS TO MAKE ME LOSE THE GRACE OF THAT GOOD KING. L WHILE I WAS THUS DISMALLY DEBATING WITH MYSELF I HEARD ASCANIO CALLING ME
THE DUKE IS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AND YOU WILL COME BADLY OUT OF THE AFFAIR
YET SOME TRIFLES OF GOLD VARNISH AND VARIOUS OTHER LITTLE FINISHINGS WERE STILL WANTING
SO THEN I CLOSED THE SCREEN AND ONCE MORE SET MYSELF TO FINISHING MY STATUE
IT WILL BE AMPLY MADE UP IN THE FUTURE FOR YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH HONEST FOLK
AFTERWARDS HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD DROWN ME IN GOLD AND THAT HE GAVE ME THE LEAVE I ASKED
THE FLORENTINE SLANG IS IO HO IN CULO LORO E IL DUCA NOTE 9
AND WHOSOEVER IN THIS WAY SHALL HAVE GAINED THE CREDIT OF THE BEST DESIGN WILL JUSTLY HAVE DESERVED THE COMMISSION
I THEN UNFOLDED THE WHOLE MATTER AND SHOWED HIM THE LITTLE MAP WITH WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE MUCH GRATIFIED
AND THE WORK WENT ONWARD BRISKLY DAY AND NIGHT
O GRACIOUS AND UNDYING JUST AND HOLY OUR LORD ALL THE THINGS THOU DOEST ARE ACCORDING TO THY JUSTICE WHICH HATH NO PEER ON EARTH
THE DUCHESS COMMANDED THE SAME MEN WHENEVER I SHOWED MY FACE AT THAT PALACE TO DRIVE ME FROM ITS GATES
ACCORDINGLY MY FRIEND THE NOBLEMAN REPLIED THAT HE WOULD BRING ME WHERE THEY CHOSE TO APPOINT AND THAT HE WAS VERY WILLING TO EFFECT A RECONCILIATION
BUT URBINOS STUPID SPEECH ABOUT THE FLAYING MADE HIM LAUGH ALOUD
THE ONE ALLUDED TO HERE IS PROBABLY FRANCESCO
THERE WERE INDEED SOME IN FLORENCE WHO WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE COME BUT BANDINELLO PREVENTED THEM AND AFTER KEEPING ME IN WANT OF AID AWHILE TOLD THE DUKE THAT I WAS TRYING TO ENTICE HIS WORK-PEOPLE BECAUSE I WAS QUITE INCAPABLE OF SETTING UP SO GREAT A STATUE BY MYSELF
BERTINO HAD BEEN TRAINED LIKE A PUPIL BY MY BROTHER
WHEREUPON THEY ALL WITH HEARTINESS AND HAPPY CHEER ASSISTED AND OBEYED MY BIDDING WHILE I NOW HERE NOW THERE GAVE ORDERS HELPED WITH MY OWN HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD
TO WHICH HE ANSWERED THAT HE COULD AND GAVE HIS DESCRIPTION
XXXVIII I SHALL SKIP OVER SOME INTERVENING CIRCUMSTANCES AND TELL HOW POPE CLEMENT WISHING TO SAVE THE TIARAS AND THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF THE GREAT JEWELS OF THE APOSTOLIC CAMERA HAD ME CALLED AND SHUT HIMSELF UP TOGETHER WITH ME AND THE CAVALIERINO IN A ROOM ALONE
ON ALL OCCASIONS AFTER I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO AID MYSELF
LV I HAD GOT ALL THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THINGS IN ORDER AND WAS MAKING VIGOROUS PREPARATIONS FOR MY GREAT UNDERTAKING--INDEED A PORTION OF THE LIME HAD BEEN ALREADY USED--WHEN I RECEIVED SUDDEN NOTICE TO APPEAR BEFORE THE MAJORDOMO
ON SEEING WHICH I SAID IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VASE THAT EVER I SET EYES ON
AFTERWARDS I WRAPT THEM SEPARATELY UP IN BITS OF PAPER AND WE SEWED THEM INTO THE LININGS OF THE POPES AND THE CAVALIERES CLOTHES
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF MEN ARE MY EQUALS AND WHO ARE YOURS--MERE TEACHERS OF THE ALPHABET TO CHILDREN! HIS FACE CONTRACTED WITH A SPASM WHILE HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND REPEATED THE SAME WORDS IN A STILL MORE INSULTING TONE
CRESPINO YOU HAVE MISTAKEN YOUR MAN. NO, SAID CRESPINO YOU ARE THE ARTIST BENVENUTO AND I KNOW YOU WELL AND I HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO THE CASTLE OF SANT ANGELO WHERE LORDS GO AND MEN OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOUR PEERS. UPON THAT FOUR OF HIS UNDER-OFFICERS RUSHED ON ME AND WOULD HAVE SEIZED BY FORCE A DAGGER WHICH I WORE AND SOME RINGS I CARRIED ON MY FINGER
THEY KEPT AND SHOWED IT TO THE DOCTOR WHO SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT BEFORE AND AFTERWARDS REMARKED TO FELICE
THUS THEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN I HAD UPON A CERTAIN EVENING INVITED THAT WOMAN PANTASILEA TO SUPPER AND HAD ASSEMBLED A COMPANY OF MEN OF PARTS WHO WERE MY FRIENDS JUST AT THE MOMENT OF OUR SITTING DOWN TO TABLE MESSER GIOVANNI AND LUIGI PULCI ARRIVED AND AFTER SOME COMPLIMENTARY SPEECHES THEY BOTH REMAINED TO SUP WITH US
BENVENUTO DID IT BUT THE STUPID CREATURE BROUGHT IT DOWN UPON HIMSELF. NO SOONER HAD POMPEO REACHED THE POPE THAN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK
ORSOLA AND THEY ALSO PURCHASED FOR HIM SOME VERY GOOD PROPERTY NEAR THE PONTE A RIFREDI
WHEN I WANTED TO THANK THE CARDINAL IN PERSON HE SENT WORD BY ONE OF HIS SECRETARIES THAT HE WOULD GLADLY DO ME A SERVICE WHENEVER THE OCCASION OFFERED
CASTING A HASTY GLANCE UPON MY TWO HEADS AND SEEING THEY WERE ALL RIGHT I TEMPERED MY ANNOYANCE WITH THE PLEASURE THAT SIGHT GAVE ME
AND IN THE CARE OF HIS CHILDREN AS EARLIER OF HIS SISTER AND NIECES HE SHOWED MORE TENDERNESS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MAN OF HIS BOISTEROUS NATURE
WHILE THUS ENGAGED YOU SEQUESTERED UNKNOWN TO HIS HOLINESS A PORTION OF THEM TO THE VALUE OF EIGHTY THOUSAND CROWNS
ON ARRIVING THERE HIS EXCELLENCY SENT FOR THE ARCHBISHOP OF PISA NAMED DE BARTOLINI AND MESSER PANDOLFO DELLA STUFA 2 REQUESTING THEM TO ORDER BACCIO BANDINELLI IN HIS NAME TO EXAMINE WELL MY PERSEUS AND VALUE IT SINCE HE WISHED TO PAY ITS EXACT PRICE
I CHANGED THE CONVERSATION IN ORDER TO COVER HIS EMBARRASSMENT
THEN I RAISED MY HEAD AS GENTLY AS I COULD AND SAID
LUCIA 2 WHICH CAME ROUND IN THREE DAYS I MADE A GOLDEN EYE OUT OF A FRENCH CROWN AND HAD IT PRESENTED AT HER SHRINE BY ONE OF MY SIX NIECES DAUGHTERS OF MY SISTER LIPERATA
AND THE CASTELLAN WHO CAME AT TIMES TO SEE ME IN MY CHAMBER NOTICING THE WAX WHICH I WAS USING RECOGNISED IT AT ONCE AND EXCLAIMED
IT IS THAT NOT FAR FROM CAMALDOLI THERE LIES A MOUNTAIN PASS SO ILL DEFENDED THAT PIERO STROZZI COULD NOT ONLY CROSS IT WITHOUT RISK BUT MIGHT ALSO SEIZE ON POPPI 1 UNMOLESTED. NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS DESCRIPTION HE ALSO TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER FROM HIS POUCH UPON WHICH THE GOOD OLD MAN HAD DRAWN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO THAT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE DANGER COULD BE MANIFEST UPON INSPECTION OF THE MAP
OH MY FRIEND
AND WHILE THERE I DEVOTED MYSELF TO DRAWING AND WORKING FOR ONE GRAZIADIO A JEW WITH WHOM I EARNED CONSIDERABLY
BUT THIS HAD BEEN STOLEN WITH A GREAT QUANTITY OF OTHER VALUABLE ARTICLES
BUT HE BEFORE THEY COULD GET A WORD OUT CRIED ALOUD
O CLEMENCY DIVINE
SER MAURIZIO WAS ENTITLED CHANCELLOR BUT REALLY SUPERINTENDED THE CRIMINAL MAGISTRACY OF FLORENCE
A CONVENT OF CLOSELY IMMURED NUNS
SO LET HIM ARM HIMSELF WITH PATIENCE. THESE WERE PRECISELY THE WORDS WHICH BANDINELLO HAD WHISPERED IN THE DUKES EARS CITING THE WORKS OF ANDREA DEL VERROCCHIO WHO MADE THAT FINE BRONZE OF CHRIST AND S
STAGGIA IS THE NEXT POST ON THE WAY TO FLORENCE
AND WHEN I REACHED THE BRIDGE RIDING BEFORE THE REST I RECOGNISED HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS AND BADE MY SERVANTS AND YOUNG MEN DISMOUNT AND LEAD THEIR HORSES
THE FIRE AND CORRECTNESS OF DESIGN OF THIS PIECE AND ITS NICETY OF WORKMANSHIP MADE EVERY ONE SAY THAT I HAD SURPASSED THE GREAT LAUTIZIO WHO RANKED ALONE IN THIS BRANCH OF THE PROFESSION
BY WORKING BRISKLY I HAD PUT TOGETHER THE SILVER JUPITER AND THE GOLDEN SALT-CELLAR
ITALIANS DISTINGUISHED CUT DIAMONDS OF THREE SORTS
NEVERTHELESS I KEPT MYSELF UNDER CONTROL UNTIL THE HOUR FOR DINNER WAS PAST
VEDENDO IL BELLO NOTE 3
BUT THOUGH I MUST RETURN A LITTLE WAY UPON MY STEPS I SHALL NOT THEREFORE ABANDON THE MAIN PATH OF MY HISTORY
FOR WE HAVE BEEN ROBBED BY SOME ONE WHO HAS BROKEN AND BORNE EVERYTHING AWAY! THESE WORDS WROUGHT SO FORCIBLY UPON MY MIND THAT I DARED NOT GO TO MY BIG CHEST AND LOOK IF IT STILL HELD THE JEWELS OF THE POPE
DURING THIS MANS ILLNESS THE DUKE SENT FOR ME AND BADE ME TAKE HIS PORTRAIT
HE HAS READ DANTE AND IN THE PROSTRATION OF HIS SICKNESS THIS APPARITION HAS APPEARED TO HIM 3 THEN HE ADDED LAUGHINGLY
HOWEVER THE QUEEN PREFERRED TO DROP NEGOTIATIONS IN FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE DUKE
AT THE SAME TIME HE KNEW WELL THAT I WAS NOT LIKE THOSE FOOLISH FOLK WHO TURN OUT SOMETHING WITH A KIND OF GRACE BUT PUT NO INTENTION INTO THEIR PERFORMANCES
A MANTLE UNDULATED TO THE WIND AROUND THE FIGURE OF THE FATHER FROM THE FOLDS OF WHICH CHERUBS PEEPED OUT
MANY MOST EXCELLENT FLORENTINES WERE CONVINCED THAT THE MEDICEAN GOVERNMENT WAS BENEFICIAL
IN ORDER TO AVOID DOING WHICH I RETURNED TO THE POPE AND TOLD HIS HOLINESS THAT I WAS VERY UNWILLING TO GO TO PRISON AND THAT I BEGGED HIM TO GRANT ME THE FAVOUR OF A DISPENSATION
YOU OUGHT INDEED TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS ON LEAVING FLORENCE
AMONG THE PICTURES WERE ARRANGED A GREAT VARIETY OF SCULPTURED WORKS PARTLY IN THE ROUND AND PARTLY IN BAS-RELIEF
GIO
GIO
GIO
THE EXCELLENT CASTELLAN WENT OFF UPON THE SPOT TO HIS HOLINESS AND INFORMED HIM THAT I WAS NO ACCOMPLICE IN THE MATTER AND THAT I HAD SENT ASCANIO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
HOWEVER WHEN I REACHED THE END IT APPEARED THAT THE TOES AND A LITTLE PIECE ABOVE THEM WERE UNFINISHED SO THAT ABOUT HALF THE FOOT WAS WANTING
WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOU WERE IN ROME AT THE TIME WHEN THIS UNHAPPY CITY WAS SUBJECT TO THE CALAMITY OF THE SACK
C WHEN THE DUKE CAME TO FLORENCE HE SOUGHT ME AT MY HOUSE WITHOUT GIVING ME PREVIOUS NOTICE
HE DIED IN 1570 AGED NINETY-THREE
AND THESE BEFORE I GIVE THEM UP I HOPE YOULL GET NOT MUCH TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. THEN CROSSING MY SWORD BOLDLY WITH THEM I MORE THAN ONCE SPREAD OUT MY ARMS IN ORDER THAT IF THE RUFFIANS WERE PUT ON BY THE SERVANTS WHO HAD SEEN ME TAKE MY MONEY THEY MIGHT BE LED TO JUDGE I WAS NOT CARRYING IT
I DID NOT CARE TO GO AND SEE IT SINCE I WANTED TO COMPLETE THE MODEL OF MY COLOSSAL NEPTUNE
TELL ME CROSS-GRAINED HUNCHBACK IS THERE NO OTHER FACE TO SEE HERE BUT YOUR UGLY VISAGE? NO AND BAD LUCK TO YOU. WHERETO I ANSWERED IN A LOUD VOICE
I THANK GOD THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED AND CAN REPORT WHAT THE FAITH OF POPES IS MADE OF. THEN THE GOVERNOR LAUNCHED OUT INTO BRUTAL BULLYING WORDS AND GESTURES
PAR DIEU
THEREUPON I SENT FOR THE JEWELLERS
WHEN THE NECROMANCER HAD CONCLUDED HIS CEREMONIES HE PUT OFF HIS WIZARDS ROBE AND PACKED UP A GREAT BUNDLE OF BOOKS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
ONE HOUR OF THE NIGHT WAS ONE HOUR AFTER NIGHTFALL AND SO FORTH
SO HE HUNTED OUT ANOTHER OF HIS SERVANTS WHO WAS MY FRIEND AND SENT ME FOOD BY THIS MANS HANDS
IN THIS QUARTER HE CAME TO DUEL WITH A YOUNG FELLOW OF TWENTY OR THEREABOUTS
I MADE MY MIND UP THEREFORE WENT TO LIVORNO AND FOUND MY PRINCE WHO RECEIVED ME WITH EXCEEDING GRACIOUSNESS
BUT A SON OF HIS CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS
OR IF I WERE TO SEND YOU AWAY WITHOUT MONEY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THEN
WHEN I CAME TO PISA I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME I STOPPED NEAR THE MIDDLE BRIDGE BY WHAT IS CALLED THE FISH-STONE AT THE SHOP OF A GOLDSMITH AND BEGAN ATTENTIVELY TO WATCH WHAT THE MASTER WAS ABOUT
THAT WAS THE FATHER AND THE SON
SO HE SAID TO ME BENVENUTO IF YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD HIT THAT WALL AN ELLS BREADTH FROM THE SUN WITH YOUR DEMI-CANNON HERE I BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE DOING A GOOD STROKE OF BUSINESS FOR THERE IS A GREAT COMMOTION THERE AND MEN OF MUCH IMPORTANCE MUST PROBABLY BE INSIDE THE HOUSE. I ANSWERED THAT I FELT QUITE CAPABLE OF HITTING THE SUN IN ITS CENTRE BUT THAT A BARREL FULL OF STONES WHICH WAS STANDING CLOSE TO THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN MIGHT BE KNOCKED DOWN BY THE SHOCK OF THE DISCHARGE AND THE BLAST OF THE ARTILLERY
FRA BENEDETTO DA FOIANO HAD INCURRED THE WRATH OF POPE CLEMENT VII
AND ABOVE IT GOD THE FATHER WAS SHOWN SEATED LEANING NOBLY IN A SIDEWAYS ATTITUDE 3 WHICH MADE A PERFECT COMPOSITION AND DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE STONES EFFECT
FOR THE REST MY WORK HAS RECEIVED THE GREATEST REWARD I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR IN THIS WORLD
I MADE A HEARTY MEAL THEN MOUNTED AND RODE TOWARD FLORENCE
SEE THAT MEN ROB YOU OF YOUR ALL BY WRONG
THE OTHER SECTION HE SENT UPON THE ROAD TO FLORENCE
SO THEN I BEGAN THE FIGURE OF MEDUSA AND CONSTRUCTED THE SKELETON IN IRON
LET US GO TO FIORENZE; AS WELL BECAUSE THE SAID CAPTAIN WAS CALLED FIORINO AS ALSO BECAUSE THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN FOR HIS QUARTERS WAS BY NATURE VERY RICH IN FLOWERS
THIS FELLOW SHE INTRODUCED TO THE KING WHO WAS MUCH DELIGHTED BY THE PROCESSES FOR DISTILLING WHICH HE EXHIBITED
THEN I BOUND MY LEG UP AS WELL AS I COULD AND CRAWLED ON ALL FOURS WITH THE PONIARD IN MY HAND TOWARD THE CITY GATE
NATURE IN ME WAS UTTERLY DEBILITATED AND UNDONE
WHEN THEN I ASCENDED TO THE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD MELTED DOWN THE GOLD AND WASHED THE ASHES I FOUND ABOUT A POUND AND A HALF OF GOLD IN TINY GRAINS LIKE MILLET-SEEDS
I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY MORE. NOTE 1
I DONT KNOW NOW WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD. THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
QUAL MODO SINTENDEVA CONTRO NATURA CIOè IN SODDOMIA XXX THE MORE I SOUGHT FOR REST THE MORE I WAS ANNOYED WITH ALL SORTS OF EMBARRASSMENTS
AND WE ARE READY TO DO WHATEVER YOU PROPOSE. MESSER BENVEGNATO SEEING THE HALL FILLED WITH SUCH A CROWD OF MEN CALLED OUT
ON THE MORNING OF SAINT JOHNS DAY I HAPPENED TO BE DINING WITH SEVERAL MEN OF OUR NATION PAINTERS SCULPTORS GOLDSMITHS AMONGST THE MOST NOTABLE OF WHOM WAS ROSSO AND GAINFRANCESCO THE PUPIL OF RAFFAELLO
I TOOK MY LEAVE WITHOUT FURTHER CEREMONY AND LEFT THEM ALONE TOGETHER
4 THAT PONIARD IS MINE AND I LENT IT TO BENVENUTO WHO WAS BENT ON REVENGING HIS BROTHER. THE SOLDIERS WERE PROFUSE IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET AT HAVING INTERRUPTED ME ALTHOUGH MY VENGEANCE HAD BEEN AMPLY SATISFIED
I CANNOT RECALL THE NAMES OF THE REST
WOULD GOD FOR YOUR WELL-BEING THAT YOUR SONS MAY ACT NEITHER WORSE NOR BETTER TOWARD YOU THAN MINE DO TO ME
HE WAS THE SON OF ONE OF THE PULCIS WHO HAD BEEN BEHEADED FOR INCEST WITH HIS DAUGHTER
HE HOWEVER WOULD GLADLY CARRY THE MONEY FOR ME
YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO. THE DUKE MADE ANSWER
I FIRED AND HIT MY MAN EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE
WHEN I HAD ATTACHED IT TO THAT PIECE OF TILE I TURNED TO GOD AND SAID
IN ANSWER TO HIS QUESTIONS THE TWO MEN WHOM I SUSPECTED OF HAVING CAKED MY METAL FOR ME SAID I WAS NO MAN BUT OF A CERTAINTY SOME POWERFUL DEVIL SINCE I HAD ACCOMPLISHED WHAT NO CRAFT OF THE ART COULD DO
ONLY THIS MORNING I WAS INFORMED THAT YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF IT AND HAVE FILCHED IT FROM ME
YET I ACCOUNT MYSELF AMPLY REMUNERATED BY THAT FIRST REWARD WHICH THE SCHOOL OF FLORENCE GAVE ME
ON HEARING THESE KINDLY WORDS I REPLIED THAT I HAD NEVER ASKED ANY OTHER RECOMPENSE FOR MY LABOURS THAN THE GOOD GRACES OF THE DUKE AND THAT HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY HAD ASSURED ME OF THIS
BOTH THE CHALICE AND THE MINT HAD CERTAINLY AS MUCH OF MY ATTENTION AS WAS DUE TO THEM AND TO MYSELF
COSA IS FLORENTINE FOR NICCOLòSA
AND OBSERVING THAT THE EMPEROR HAD TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME WITH A VERY GRACIOUS LOOK I ADVANCED AT ONCE AND SAID
ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I WAS SATISFIED
IT WAS OUR FATHERS WISH TO MAKE ME THE ELDER A GREAT MUSICIAN AND COMPOSER AND HIM THE YOUNGER A GREAT AND LEARNED JURIST
THE FIRST WAS CALLED BERTINO ALDOBRANDI ANOTHER ANGUILLOTTO OF LUCCA
DO WHAT I ASK MY BENVENUTO JUST TO PLEASE ME. WHEN THE DUKE HAD LEFT I GAVE ORDERS TO HAVE THE SCREEN REMOVED
CHE LA FACESSI PIù NETTA CHE POTEVA LXXVI I REACHED FLORENCE IN DUE COURSE AND PAID MY RESPECTS TO THE DUKE ALESSANDRO WHO GREETED ME WITH EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS AND PRESSED ME TO REMAIN IN HIS SERVICE
MORE THAN EIGHT DAYS ELAPSED AND THE POPE DID NOT SEND FOR ME ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM
BENVENUTO COME WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU A GLASS OF GOOD WINE TO DRINK. I ANSWERED NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE MEANT
I KNEW THAT HE WAS SPEAKING THE MERE TRUTH AND BEGAN TO LEND EAR TO HIS ARGUMENTS
LXXVIII ACCORDINGLY I GIRDED ON MY SWORD AND WENT TO VISIT JACOPO DEL SANSOVINO THE SCULPTOR WHO HAD SENT FOR TRIBOLO
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THE ITALIAN RESTANDO DAL MIO AVVERSARIO SEEMS TO MEAN THAT CELLINIS OPPONENT PROPOSED AN ACCOMMODATION APOLOGIZED OR STAYED THE DUEL AT A CERTAIN POINT
I FEEL SURE HE WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE
ALL THESE DIVERS ARTS I SET MYSELF WITH UNFLAGGING INDUSTRY TO LEARN
SEEING INTO THEIR PLOT I WENT ABOUT WITH MY EYES OPEN AND WITH GOOD ATTENDANCE WEARING AN UNDER-COAT AND ARMLETS OF MAIL FOR WHICH I HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION
GIOVANNI SALVIATI THE SON OF JACOPO MENTIONED ABOVE WAS ALSO A NEPHEW OF LEO X WHO GAVE HIM THE HAT IN 1517
UPON THIS INVITATION I ACCEPTED WITH THANKS
BENVENUTO AND MALVENUTO NOTE 2
BUT WHILE I WAS WORKING AT IT I CAUGHT A QUARTAN FEVER
WHEREUPON I CALLED OUT
233 AND PLON P
AT THESE WORDS MONSIEUR DE SAINT PAUL EXPRESSED HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE CHARGE SAYING THAT IF THE KING APPOINTED HIM MY GUARDIAN HE WOULD ACT SO THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE CHANCE TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM
IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY PIUS II
RELY ON THE DUKES GOODWILL TOWARDS YOU. ACCORDINGLY I MADE MY WAY AGAIN TO FLORENCE
I BOUGHT THE MARBLES WITH MY OWN MONEY AND HAVE KEPT A YOUNG MAN SOME TWO YEARS AS MY ASSISTANT IN THE WORK
I REMEMBER YET ANOTHER PRECIOUS STONE DIFFERENT FROM THESE
WELL THE PATH WAS SO BAD THAT THE HORSE STUMBLED AND WENT ON SCRAMBLING BACKWARDS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO REGAIN HIS FOOTING TILL HE STUCK UPON THE POINT OF THE LANCE WHICH THAT ROGUE OF A COURIER HAD NOT THE WIT TO KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY
THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF CELLINIS EXAGGERATION
AND WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE OUR SISTER DWELT THE SURPRISE OF SEEING ME ALIVE THREW HER INTO A FAINTING FIT AND SHE FELL SENSELESS IN MY ARMS
THEY EXAGGERATED THE WHOLE AFFAIR SO MUCH POSSIBLY IN ORDER TO EXCUSE THEIR OWN PART IN IT THAT THE MAJORDOMO WROTE AN ACCOUNT TO THE DUKE WHO WAS THEN IN PISA FAR MORE MARVELLOUS AND FULL OF THRILLING INCIDENTS THAN WHAT THEY HAD NARRATED
I HAD LEFT ROME ON MONDAY IN PASSION WEEK TOGETHER WITH PAGOLO AND ASCANIO
WE CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS OF THE ALBA AND BERLINA
ST JOHNS DAY WAS THE GREAT FLORENTINE FESTIVAL ON WHICH ALL THE GUILDS WENT IN PROCESSION WITH PAGEANTS THROUGH THE CITY
HE DIED AT FAENZA IN 1555
LET US SAVE OUR LIVES AND GIVE THANKS TO GOD FOR ALL THAT HAPPENS
I SAID THAT IT WAS NOT THE CUSTOM TO PURSUE MY PROFESSION IN THE POST AND THAT IF I HAD TO GO IT WAS MY INTENTION TO MAKE EASY STAGES AND TO TAKE WITH ME THE WORKMEN ASCANIO AND PAGOLO WHOM I HAD BROUGHT FROM ROME
ONE DAY WHEN WE HAD BECOME INTIMATE AND HE COULD TRUST ME HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
GO ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT AND YOUR FATHER SHALL GO WITH YOU. DON DIEGO PUT IN
BORN 1485 DIED 1550
A CERTAIN MICHELETTO HAD JUST COME TO ROME
HOWEVER HE PREFERS THIS MODE OF LIFE AND OCCUPIES A HOUSE WHICH BELONGS TO ME IN THE TOWN OF VICCHIO
OH GET AWAY WITH YOU OR BLOW YOUR CHAPS OUT TILL I SMACK THEM! THE KNAVE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT HE WAS AFTER
BUT I DEEMED THAT HE HAD ACTED A FAR WORSE PART WITH REGARD TO ME BY NEVER COMING TO MY ASSISTANCE AT SUCH PINCHES
END OF PART TWO END OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENVENUTO CELLINI
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER FROM FLORENCE NAMED PAGOLO MICCERI
VI AT THAT PERIOD THE DUKE OF FERRARA CAME TO TERMS WITH POPE PAUL ABOUT SOME OLD MATTERS IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO MODENA AND CERTAIN OTHER CITIES
GIOVAN FRANCESCO THE PAINTER I HAVE MENTIONED GAVE US THE DESIGN
AND SINCE VITRUVIUS SAYS AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT ONE WHO WISHES TO PRACTISE THAT ART WELL MUST HAVE SOMETHING OF MUSIC AND GOOD DRAWING GIOVANNI WHEN HE HAD MASTERED DRAWING BEGAN TO TURN HIS MIND TO MUSIC AND TOGETHER WITH THE THEORY LEARNED TO PLAY MOST EXCELLENTLY ON THE VIOL AND THE FLUTE
LEAVE HER ALONE
HE ALSO PROVIDED ME WITH WOOD AND CLAY SET UP A SORT OF SCREEN IN THE LOGGIA WHERE MY PERSEUS STANDS AND PAID ME ONE WORKMAN
4 I ANSWERED THAT THIS FEATURE OF THE DIAMOND WAS NOT SO GREAT A BEAUTY AS HIS EXCELLENCY SUPPOSED BUT CAME FROM THE POINT HAVING BEEN CROPPED
BUT I DREW MY MONIES SO DISCREETLY THAT I HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING TO MY CREDIT ACCORDING TO MY ACCOUNT
1 IN COURSE OF TIME I CAME TO FLORENCE IN THE COMPANY OF SEVERAL COMRADES
IF THEN I WREAK MY SPITE SO FULLY UPON HIM WHILE UPON HER I INFLICT THE DISCOMFORT OF POSING IN SUCH STRANGE ATTITUDES FOR SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME--WHICH BESIDE THE PLEASURE I DERIVE BRINGS ME BOTH PROFIT AND CREDIT THROUGH MY ART--WHAT MORE CAN I DESIRE? WHILE I WAS TURNING OVER THESE CALCULATIONS THE WRETCH REDOUBLED HER INSULTING SPEECHES ALWAYS PRATING BIG ABOUT HER HUSBAND TILL SHE GOADED ME BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF REASON
I RENOUNCE THE TASK AND AM QUITE DECIDED NOT TO CARRY IT THROUGH. THEN SIGHING HE DEPARTED WITH THE STRONGEST SIGNS OF INWARD SORROW
YOU MUST KNOW MY LORD THAT IT WILL MAKE MORE THAN TWICE AS GOOD A SHOW
AND ON THIS POINT IN ORDER TO BE BRIEF I WILL GIVE BUT ONE PARTICULAR WHICH WILL ASTONISH GOOD SHOTS OF EVERY DEGREE
HOW CAN I VENTURE NOW INTO THE CARDINALS PRESENCE? HIS SON MADE ANSWER
ONLY THE SHADOWS OF THEM REMAIN TO THIS DAY
JUST THEN HIS EYES CHANCED TO FALL UPON A PAIR OF SCISSORS
HIS MERCY REMAINING IN THE MEANWHILE TRANQUIL
WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD HEARD THE WHOLE HE SAID
I OUGHT HERE TO SAY THAT WE HAD MADE A PURSE UP AND THAT I PERFORMED THE PART OF PAYMASTER
THEY REPRESENTED NIGHT DAY TWILIGHT AND DAWN
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ON WHICH LEG HE STANDS OR WHICH HE USES TO EXERT HIS STRENGTH
I ENTREAT YOU THEREFORE MY LORD NOT TO LET HIM ENTER ANY MORE. THE CASTELLAN WAS MUCH GRIEVED BECAUSE HE KNEW HIM TO BE A LAD OF MARVELLOUS TALENTS
HE REJOINED THAT IN HIS OPINION I HAD NOT OVERVALUED IT
SO I PRAISED HIM MUCH MORE FOR THE SECOND THAN THE FIRST SINCE HE HAD GAINED FOR ME MY LIFE
HERE WE OBTAINED EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT AND THEN ENGAGED GUIDES WHO WERE RETURNING TO A TOWN CALLED SURICH
AND AS THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE FIGURE ON EACH PIECE HE ASKED AT LEAST A HUNDRED GOLD CROWNS FOR HIS FEE
I ALSO USED TO MAKE A VERY FINE SORT OF POWDER IN DOING WHICH I DISCOVERED SECRET PROCESSES BEYOND ANY WHICH HAVE YET BEEN FOUND
THEN I HASTENED MY STEPS AND WENT ON ALWAYS WALKING BACKWARDS AS I HAVE DESCRIBED UNTIL I DISCOVERED THE WHOLE SPHERE OF THE SUN
MY GOOD FRIEND THE CARDINAL GAVE ME PERMISSION AND LENT ME HORSES
THE TEXT HERE IS OBSCURE
THEN I SAID THAT I HAD FOUND A PLACE WHICH SEEMED TO ME EXACTLY SUITED TO MY INDUSTRY
NOW I AM HERE AT THE FEET OF YOUR HOLINESS WHO IS THE ONLY TRUE CONFESSOR
BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS I SUCCUMBED TO THE MALADY AND TOOK TO MY BED
THERE WERE ALSO OTHER MASTERS WHO WORKED AT MEDALS CARVED IN STEEL WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE MODELS AND TRUE GUIDES FOR THOSE WHO AIM AT STRIKING COINS IN THE MOST PERFECT STYLE
ON REACHING THE WALLS BY THE CAMPO SANTO WE COULD SEE THAT FAMOUS ARMY WHICH WAS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO ENTER THE TOWN
BESIDES YOU ARE A FLORENTINE
IN THE YEAR 1552 WHEN PIERO STROZZI ACTED AS GENERAL FOR THE FRENCH KING HENRI II AGAINST THE SPANIARDS
AND AFTER WAITING BY ME MORE THAN AN HOUR THINKING I WAS GROWING COLD THEY LEFT ME FOR DEAD
THEN TURNING ROUND SHE TOOK THE ROMAN LADYS HAND AND WITH A PLEASANT SMILE SAID
YET HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DEALT THUS WITH ME FOR I HAVE EVER STRAINED MY SENSE OF RIGHT TO SHOW HIM KINDNESS
CONSEQUENTLY IF I SUCCEEDED IN OUSTING HIM I SHOULD HAVE ACTED RIGHTLY AND SHOULD NOT INCUR ANY RISK
THE YOUTH WAS CALLED BERNARDINO MANNELLINI OF MUGELLO
BUT HENRY THE DAUPHIN HIS SON NOW KING OF FRANCE WHO HAD RECEIVED SOME AFFRONTS FROM THAT IMPERIOUS WOMAN TOGETHER WITH THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE SISTER TO KING FRANCIS ESPOUSED MY CAUSE SO CLEVERLY THAT HE PASSED THE MATTER OVER WITH A LAUGH
THIS OFFICER MADE SOME RESISTANCE PLEADING THAT HE COULD NOT CARRY OUT THE ORDER
SO HE BEGAN HIS TREATMENT
AND THE FIRST I MADE WAS A PIECE OF FORTY SOLDI WITH THE DUKES HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND SAN COSIMO AND SAN DAMIANO ON THE OTHER
THESE AIR-VENTS OR SFIATATOI WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE OUTER MOULD WHICH CELLINI CALLS THE TONACA OR CLAY TUNIC LAID UPON THE ORIGINAL MODEL OF BAKED CLAY AND WAX
WHEREFORE MY FATHER SAID TO HIM
I HAD SHUT MYSELF UP ALONE IN A LITTLE STUDY
NOW THE FRENCH ARE IN THE HABIT OF MAKING MUCH CAPITAL OUT OF ANY ACTION THEY COMMENCE AGAINST A FOREIGNER OR AGAINST SUCH PERSONS AS THEY NOTICE TO BE INDOLENT IN LITIGATION
IT WAS ALMOST BRIGHT DAY WHEN THINKING THEY WOULD HAVE TO ABANDON HOPE THEY GAVE ORDERS TO HAVE MY SHROUD MADE AND TO WASH ME
I RECKONED THAT AS THE MARKET THEN RAN THESE TOGETHER WERE WORTH SOMETHING CONSIDERABLY OVER A HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS IN GOLD
THE WOMAN RECEIVED ME WITH DEMONSTRATIONS OF GOOD-WILL AND SAID THAT SHE WOULD SPEAK A WORD TO MADAME WHO WAS STILL ENGAGED UPON HER TOILETTE
MY LORDS IT IS MORE THAN HALF-AN-HOUR NOW SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN PESTERING ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT FABLES AND SUCH THINGS SO THAT ONE MAY TRULY SAY YOU ARE CHATTERING OR PRATTLING
IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP THE ARNO AND THEN BY THE GRIEVE 1 TO THE ROAD AT POGGIO A CAIANO IN ORDER TO BE CARRIED TO FLORENCE BY THAT LEVEL WAY
AND INASMUCH AS THOSE LONGINGS TO WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN ARE SUBJECT AND TO WHICH THEY PAY MUCH ATTENTION WERE NOW EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE OF HER FORMER PREGNANCY THEY MADE THEIR MINDS UP THAT SHE WOULD GIVE BIRTH TO A FEMALE AS BEFORE AND AGREED TO CALL THE CHILD REPARATA AFTER THE MOTHER OF MY MOTHER
AFTERWARDS HE PAID IT PROLONGED ATTENTION
DRAWING HIMSELF UP AS STIFF AS A POKER HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO THIS EFFECT
HE WOULD ALLOW THEM THROUGH ME A CERTAIN FAVOUR FOR WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY PETITIONED NAMELY THE RIGHT OF RECOVERING THEIR FEES AT LAW
TO THIS I SAID THAT I HAD NOT SET THE STONE AND THAT IT WAS NOT WELL SET
LXXV ABANDONED THUS TO MY OWN RESOURCES I TOOK NEW COURAGE AND BANISHED THE SAD THOUGHTS WHICH KEPT RECURRING TO MY MIND MAKING ME OFTEN WEEP BITTER TEARS OF REPENTANCE FOR HAVING LEFT FRANCE
YOUNG SIGNOR SFORZA WHO HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS SAID THAT I HAD BEEN PREVENTED BY ILLNESS FROM COMING
WHEN MY FATHER HEARD OF THIS HE TOOK HIS SWORD AND WENT TO SEE THE MAN
ACCORDINGLY HE RECOGNISED ME FIRST AND SAID
HE HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT THE POPE MADE KNOWN HIS INTENTION OF COMPENSATING ME FOR ALL I HAD GONE THROUGH
HEARING THESE WORDS I SHOWED THEM THE MUZZLE OF MY GUN AND PREPARED TO FIRE AND CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE
WHEN THE DUCHESS HEARD SHE SAID
BUT I HAVE GIRT THIS SWORD AND DAGGER TO MY SIDE IN ORDER TO SHOW HIM THAT MY STEEL CAN CUT AS WELL AS HIS AND THAT I TOO AM A FLORENTINE OF THE MICCERI A FAR BETTER FAMILY THAN HIS CELLINI. THE SCOUNDREL WHO REPORTED THIS POISONOUS GOSSIP SPOKE IT WITH SUCH GOOD EFFECT THAT I FELT A FEVER IN THE INSTANT SWOOP UPON ME
I THEN ORDERED HALF A PIG OF PEWTER TO BE BROUGHT WHICH WEIGHED ABOUT SIXTY POUNDS AND FLUNG IT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CAKE INSIDE THE FURNACE
ALAS TO US
2 IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE DIAMOND IN QUESTION OFFERED MORE DIFFICULTIES THAN ANY OTHERS WHICH BEFORE OR AFTERWARDS HAVE COME INTO MY HANDS AND MILIANOS FOIL WAS MADE WITH TRUE ARTISTIC SKILL
AND GOD WHO ALWAYS HELPS THE RIGHT AND I WHO KNOW HOW TO ASSERT IT WILL SHOW YOU TO WHAT EXTENT YOU HAVE DONE WRONG. MESSER FRANCESCO ANSWERED
XXXIII I HAD BUT JUST DISMOUNTED FROM MY HORSE WHEN ONE OF THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE WHO REJOICE IN MISCHIEF-MAKING CAME TO TELL ME THAT PAGOLO MICCERI HAD TAKEN A HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE HUSSY CATERINA AND HER MOTHER AND THAT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING THERE AND WHENEVER HE MENTIONED ME USED WORDS OF SCORN TO THIS EFFECT
HE WAS FRENCH AND A PERSON OF THE LOWEST BIRTH
FRIEND GIVE EAR

SEE CELLINIS TREATISE OREFICERIA CAP
WHEREUPON I PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE DUKE AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
ABOUT THIS TIME THERE FELL INTO MY HANDS SOME LITTLE TURKISH PONIARDS
IT WAS RUMOURED THAT HE CAUSED THE HISTORIAN FRANCESCO GUICCIARDINIS DEATH BY POISON
AFTERWARDS THE DUCHESS CALLED ME TO HER SIDE
I SHALL BE SATISFIED IF YOU KEEP THAT SUM OF MINE FOR ME AT INTEREST SO THAT I MAY GAIN A LITTLE ON IT. WHEN WE CAME TO SQUARE ACCOUNTS ON THIS OCCASION I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS ILL DISPOSED TOWARDS ME SINCE INSTEAD OF TREATING ME AFFECTIONATELY ACCORDING TO HIS PREVIOUS WONT HE PUT ON A STIFF AIR
GIOVANNI THE FLEMING ALSO MADE A MODEL IN THE CLOISTER OF S
I HAD SPENT INFINITE PAINS UPON THE DESIGN SO THAT THE ATTITUDE OF THE FIGURE AND THE FIERCE PASSION OF THE BEAST WERE EXECUTED IN QUITE A DIFFERENT STYLE FROM THAT OF ANY CRAFTSMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO ATTEMPTED SUCH GROUPS
XCVIII AFTER TAKING SOME REPOSE IN PARIS I WENT TO VISIT THE PAINTER ROSSO WHO WAS IN THE KINGS SERVICE
HE THEN REMARKED
AS I HAVE ABOVE RELATED THE DUKE CAME DAILY INTO OUR GOLDSMITHS WORKSHOP FOR SEVERAL HOURS
I BECAME AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE THE DEAD TEETH BEING PUSHED OUT BY THE LIVING ONES MY GUMS WERE GRADUALLY PERFORATED AND THE POINTS OF THE ROOTS PIERCED THROUGH THE TOPS OF THEIR CASES
THEREFORE I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO. THE BISHOP OF VASONA THEN CAME UP AND PUT IN A WORD FOR BASTIANO SAYING
THE OLD MAN WANTING TO BE FIRST UPON THE STAIRCASE TUMBLED DOWN SOME STEPS AND ALL THE REST OF THEM CAME HUDDLING AFTER HIM
LIT THE LARGEST PIECE LEFT OF ME SHOULD BE MY EARS. XXV WHEN POPE CLEMENT HEARD THE STORY-HE HAD SEEN THE VASE BEFORE BUT IT WAS NOT SHOWN HIM AS MY WORK-HE EXPRESSED MUCH PLEASURE AND SPOKE WARMLY IN MY PRAISE PUBLICLY SAYING THAT HE FELT VERY FAVOURABLY TOWARD ME
WHEN I HEARD THIS I TURNED TO DON DIEGO AND SAID
2 MY FIRST MASTER FIRENZUOLA HAD A GREAT QUARREL ABOUT THIS WITH ARSAGO AND ABUSED HIM IN MY PRESENCE
MY LORD BENVENUTO IS A MAN WHO DOES NOT NEED OTHER PEOPLES SKETCHES AS YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL BE VERY WELL ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN YOU SHALL SEE HIS MODEL. I SET HAND TO THE WORK AND MADE A DRAWING FOR THE RELIQUARY WELL ADAPTED TO CONTAIN THE SACRED PHIAL
THE DUKE TOLD HIM WE WERE JOKING AND THAT HE WANTED ME FOR HIS OWN SERVICE
TO HIM IN PARTICULAR I SPOKE
GO TO THE OPERA AND CHOOSE A PIECE ACCORDING TO YOUR TASTE. I DEMURRED THAT THE MAN HAD PROMISED TO SENT IT HOME TO ME
STAY HERE
SO I GOT ACROSS WITHOUT ACCIDENT AND RODE ON TALKING WITH ONE OF THE FRENCHMEN WHOSE CONDITION WAS THAT OF A GENTLEMAN
VARCHI AND SEGNI BOTH SPEAK OF HIM AS HARSH AND CRUEL IN THE DISCHARGE OF HIS OFFICE
YOU WOULD ONLY THROW AWAY YOUR TIME BECAUSE I HAVE IT NOW AND IT IS MINE
SHE DROVE ME OFF WITH A TORRENT OF ABUSE SCREAMING THAT THE SIGHT OF ME WAS A CONSUMPTION TO HER
AND IN ORDER TO MAKE UP OUR QUARREL HE SENT THE SAME PAINTER TO INFORM ME THAT HE MEANT TO GIVE ME LARGE COMMISSIONS
SO I DEPARTED AND WENT OFF TO MY BUSINESS
THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WAS THERE AT MEAT WITH HIM
I VERILY BELIEVE YOU CAME TO WORK HERE AT HIS ORDERS FOR THE MERE PURPOSE OF SPYING UPON ME
HE FOLLOWED THE PROFESSION OF ARMS AND MARRIED
AND THEN HE BEGAN HIS INCANTATIONS
BUT HE WAS ALSO A WORKER IN GOLD AND SILVER REJOICING IN DELICATE CHASING AND SUBTLE MODELLING OF PRECIOUS SURFACES
FOR EACH NAIL I EXTRACTED I MADE A COUNTERFEIT IN WAX
I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE MY UTMOST TO PROVE I AM NO STATUE BUT A MAN OF FLESH AND SPIRIT. THEN WE RESUMED OUR JOURNEY
IT HAPPENED THAT THE HALL BEING VERY LARGE AND FILLED WITH A MULTITUDE OF FOLK THEY WERE STRICT IN EXCLUDING EVERY ONE WHO HAD NO BUSINESS THERE AND KEPT THE DOOR SHUT WITH A GUARD TO HOLD IT
HE LAUGHED ME IN THE FACE
AND THEN COMING TO THE MERITS OF THE DIAMOND HIS EXCELLENCY BADE ME WITHOUT HESITATION NAME THE PRICE AT WHICH I VALUED IT
HE WAS UNWILLING TO LET HIM RETURN TO ROME AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE KEPT HIM CLOSE TO HIS OWN PERSON. UPON THIS SHE RETIRED MUTTERING WORDS OF INDIGNATION AND DISPLEASURE
TO THIS EFFECT THEN BY WAY OF DIALOGUE I WROTE AS FOLLOWS BENVENUTO IN THE BODY
WHEREUPON ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A LIGHT FROM HEAVEN HAD STRUCK THE POPES EYES
ASCANIO FOR HIS PART DID ALL HE COULD TO PERSUADE ME REMINDING ME THAT WHEN THE KING SENT A MAN TO PRISON HE KEPT HIM THERE FIVE YEARS AT LEAST BEFORE HE LET HIM OUT AGAIN
THEN HE ASKED WHO HAD INSTALLED ME IN THE HOUSE AND BY WHOSE AUTHORITY I HAD BEGUN TO BUILD THERE SAYING HE MARVELLED MUCH THAT I HAD BEEN SO HEADSTRONG AND FOOLHARDY
ONLY I MUST TELL A FEW OF THE MOST REMARKABLE WHICH ARE AS IT WERE FORCED IN UPON ME
TUTTI DACCORDO MI BENEDISSONO LE MANI THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO APPROVING CELLINIS HANDIWORK IN MURDERING POMPEO
DE MARMAGNE AND M
HE TOOK ME UP AT ONCE HITCHED ME ON HIS BACK AND CARRIED ME TO THE RAISED TERRACE BY THE STEPS TO SAN PIERO
DO YOU ATTEND TO MAINTAINING THE CREDIT OF YOUR DIAMOND WHILE I ATTEND TO UNDERSTANDING MY TRADE
I HAD A KNIFE IN HAND WHICH I WAS USING FOR MY SERVICE AT THE TABLE
INDEED IF MY BOY HAD LIVED IN THOSE TIMES HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TURNED THEIR HEADS STILL MORE
AND THUS THE MATTER RESTED FOR A TIME WHILE I AGAIN ATTENDED TO MY SHOP AND BUSINESS
THE FACE TOO IS TURNED AWAY FROM THE ACTION OF THE FIGURE AND IS SO BADLY SET UPON THE NECK WITH SUCH POVERTY OF ART AND SO ILL A GRACE THAT NOTHING WORSE WAS EVER SEEN
ONLY I SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD REPAY THE SERVICE I HAD RENDERED HIM BY DOING LIKEWISE TO SOME ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE THE SAME NEED OF HIM AS HE HAD HAD OF ME
IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE CLASP TO A MANS BELT
I PRAY TO GOD THAT I MAY BE ALLOWED TO BRING YOU ALIVE TO THE KING ACCORDING TO MY PROMISE. IN FERRARA HE SENT ME TO RESIDE AT A PALACE OF HIS A VERY HANDSOME PLACE CALLED BELFIORE CLOSE UNDER THE CITY WALLS
WHEN I HAD WAITED UNTIL TWO HOURS AFTER NIGHTFALL HIS EXCELLENCY APPEARED
YOU WANTED TO IMMORTALISE THE DUKES FOR US
MY LORD ONE FOOL MAKES A HUNDRED
HE IS ALLUDING TO THE NAME FLUENZIA WHICH SOME ANTIQUARIES OF HIS DAY THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIEST NAME OF THE CITY DERIVED FROM ITS BEING NEAR ARNO FLUENTE I HAVE TRANSLATED THE WORD FLUENTE IN THE TEXT LITERALLY THOUGH OF COURSE IT SIGNIFIES SITUATED ON A FLOWING RIVER. I NEED NOT CALL ATTENTION TO THE APOCRYPHAL NATURE OF CELLINIS OWN DERIVATION FROM THE NAME OF HIS SUPPOSED ANCESTOR
I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO GO FORWARD
OH WHEN THE DUCHESS KNEW OF THIS HOW ANGRY SHE WAS
AND HE ALSO RAISED RECRUITS FROM THE GERMANS AND THE FRENCHMEN WHO FELT WELL DISPOSED TOWARD ME
NOW THE ARRANGEMENT I HAD MADE WITH THAT PERUGIAN WORKMAN 1 WAS THAT HE SHOULD WRITE DOWN ALL THE MONIES WHICH HAD BEEN DISBURSED ON HIS ACCOUNT CHIEFLY FOR CLOTHES AND DIVERS OTHER SUNDRIES
UNLESS I HAD MADE THE EXPERIMENT I COULD NOT HAVE SET ABOUT CASTING THOSE LARGE WORKS
BY CHATTERING I MEAN TALKING WITHOUT REASON BY PRATTLING I MEAN TALKING NONSENSE
IT IS TRUE THAT THE POPE BEGAN BY SAYING SO BUT HE ENDED BY SAYING QUITE THE OPPOSITE
BUT I SOON SAW THAT THEY WERE GOING THE WRONG WAY ABOUT IT AND BEGAN ON MY OWN ACCOUNT A HEAD OF JULIUS CæSAR BUST AND ARMOUR MUCH LARGER THAN THE LIFE WHICH I MODELLED FROM A REDUCED COPY OF A SPLENDID ANTIQUE PORTRAIT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM ROME
AND WHENEVER I WENT TO SEE HIM HE MET ME LAUGHING WITH SOME LITTLE SONG IN FALSETTO ON HIS LIPS
SOLOSMEO APPEARS FROM THIS PASSAGE IN CELLINI TO HAVE TAKEN THE EXECUTION OF IT OVER
I LOST NO TIME IN ANSWERING THAT THE GREATEST TREASURE I COULD WISH FOR IN THE WORLD WAS TO REGAIN THE FAVOUR OF SO GREAT A POPE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST TO ME NOT INDEED BY MY FAULT BUT BY THE FAULT OF MY OVERWHELMING ILLNESS AND THE WICKEDNESS OF THOSE ENVIOUS MEN WHO TAKE PLEASURE IN MAKING MISCHIEF
AND BEFORE I LEFT FOR ROME I SHOWED IT TO THE DUKE WHO READ IT WITH MUCH KINDLY INTEREST AND SAID TO ME
AT TWENTY-THREE OCLOCK I TOOK THE RING TO THE PALACE
AND SO I MIGHT HAVE FORCED THE MOLTEN METAL BY ITS OWN WEIGHT TO DESCEND SO FAR
THE WORDS OF THAT GREAT MAN SO HEARTENED ME THAT I SET MYSELF TO WORK AT ONCE WITH EAGERNESS UPON THE MODEL
WE CONTINUED TALKING IN THIS WAY A WHOLE HALF HOUR TOUCHING ON DIVERS TOPICS ARTISTIC AND AGREEABLE
HIS OWN NARRATIVE ADMITS SOME SENSE OF SHAME
AND AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT EVIL TIDINGS TRAVEL FASTER THAN GOOD NEWS MESSER GIACOPO GUIDI 1 SECRETARY TO HIS EXCELLENCY CALLED ME WITH HIS WRY MOUTH AND HAUGHTY VOICE
THE LATTER TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NOT MEANT THAT DIAMOND BUT WAS TALKING OF ANOTHER STONE
I TOOK WHAT I COULD GET AND MADE MY MIND UP TO LEAVE ROME WITHOUT PERMISSION
THE MEANING OF THIS IS THAT IF CLEMENT DIED CELLINI WOULD HAVE HAD HIS OPPORTUNITY OF VENGEANCE DURING THE ANARCHY WHICH FOLLOWED A VACANCY OF THE PAPAL SEE
IN THE NEXT PLACE DO YOU IMAGINE I AM IGNORANT OF YOUR GREAT BENEFITS TOWARD ME? WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED WITH ALL APPEARANCE OF SIMPLICITY AND AFFECTION FOR ME I BELIEVED THAT MATTERS STOOD PRECISELY AS HE ASSERTED
NOTWITHSTANDING I REBELLED AGAINST IT AND REFUSED TO SIT DOWN QUIETLY UNDER THE INJUSTICE ALL WAS TO NO PURPOSE
ON MY COMING UP AND BEING RECOGNISED BY SOME OF THEM THEY GAVE WAY BEFORE ME AND SHOWED ME WHAT I LEAST OF ALL THINGS WISHED TO SEE ALBEIT I MADE MIGHTY HASTE TO VIEW THE SIGHT
THEN IN THE PRESENCE OF TWELVE JOURNEYMEN AND SOME NEIGHBOURS EAGER TO BEHOLD THE RESULT OF THIS COMPETITION HE SEIZED HIS PACKET SCORNFULLY EXCLAIMING OU
LXXX NO SOONER HAD I DISMOUNTED THAT I WENT TO VISIT DUKE ALESSANDRO AND THANKED HIM GREATLY FOR HIS PRESENT OF THE FIFTY CROWNS TELLING HIS EXCELLENCY THAT I WAS ALWAYS READY TO SERVE HIM ACCORDING TO MY ABILITIES
DURING THE NIGHT I GOT NO SLEEP AND WAS CONSTANTLY DISTURBED BY MOTIONS OF MY BOWELS
SOME HINTS FOR CREATURES OF THIS SORT CAN BE OBSERVED IN NATURE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS AS FOR INSTANCE IN SNAP-DRAGONS AND SOME FEW OTHER PLANTS WHICH MUST BE COMBINED AND DEVELOPED WITH THE HELP OF FANCIFUL IMAGININGS BY CLEVER DRAUGHTSMEN
I HAD IT MUCH AT HEART TO RECOVER THE POST OF STAMPER TO THE MINT
IT WAS THE CUSTOM AT THAT EPOCH TO WEAR LITTLE GOLDEN MEDALS UPON WHICH EVERY NOBLEMAN OR MAN OF QUALITY HAD SOME DEVICE OR FANCY OF HIS OWN ENGRAVED
FOR I CAN TELL YOU BENVENUTO THAT YOU SWALLOWED A GOOD MOUTHFUL OF SUBLIMATE. THEREUPON MAESTRO FRANCESCO TOOK HIM UP AND SAID
AMBROGIO RECALCATI
TWO EVIL THINGS WOULD HAPPEN
1 ON THE FIRST OCCASION WHEN SHE DID THIS THE MERE MENTION OF THE FELLOW AROUSED ME TO INTOLERABLE FURY
FOR ONCE TRUTH HAS BEEN STRONGER THAN THE MALICE OF THE STARS
WITHOUT SUCH COMMISSION I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADVANCE SO GREAT AN UNDERTAKING ON MY OWN RESOURCES
ON THE CONTRARY I WAS SO DISCREET IN MY BEHAVIOUR THAT I MADE HIM WONDER
LXXXIII I MUST BEG YOUR ATTENTION NOW MOST GRACIOUS READER FOR A VERY TERRIBLE EVENT WHICH HAPPENED
THESE ABLE ARTISTS WHO HAVE GREAT CONCEPTIONS IN THEIR BRAIN ARE READY ENOUGH TO PUT THE SAME IN EXECUTION WITHOUT DULY CONSIDERING WHEN THEY ARE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
NOW CARDINAL CORNARO WHO HAD THE TOUCHY TEMPER OF A BEAR FLEW INTO A RAGE AND TOLD THE BISHOP HE WAS QUITE AS WELL ABLE TO DEFEND ME AS CARDINAL DE MEDICI
1 IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE TOLD ME THAT A CERTAIN GIACOPO DEL SANSOVINO HIS FIRST MASTER HAD SENT FOR HIM
IN THIS WAY I SPENT TWO HOURS BATTLING WITH THE FEVER WHICH STEADILY INCREASED AND CALLING OUT CONTINUALLY
BUT NOW I ONLY BESEECH DIEGO TO DO ME PLEASURE IN ONE HARMLESS THING
AND WHEN I REACHED THE STREET I FOUND ALL THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD MORE THAN TWELVE PERSONS
THE DAUPHIN AND DAUPHINéSS ALSO ATTENDED HIM
GO AND DO IT IN YOUR OWN WAY FOR I AM CONTENT TO HAVE IT SO. I SET TO WORK THEN WITH THE GREATEST DILIGENCE
AND ON A CERTAIN THURSDAY MORNING I EXPOSED IT TO THE PUBLIC GAZE
THERE WAS A STONE IN IT WITH SEVERAL SHARP ANGLES ONE OF WHICH STRIKING HIM HE FELL STUNNED LIKE A DEAD MAN
AFTER EMPLOYING THEM ABOUT THREE DAYS THE LAD TOLD ME THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT WORK AND THAT I HAD BETTER SEND HIM AWAY SINCE BESIDE BEING IDLE HE PREVENTED HIS COMRADE FROM WORKING
FOR I TOOK IT PARTLY FROM THE HORSE AND PARTLY FROM THE STAG ENRICHING IT WITH FANTASTIC MANE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS
HE WAS CALLED FRANCESCO SON OF FILIPPO AND GRANDSON OF FRA LIPPO LIPPI THAT MOST EXCELLENT PAINTER
UPON THIS THE DUKE ADDRESSED ME
THERE WAS NO OTHER ROAD
THE DUCHESS THINKING WE HAD STOPPED TALKING FOR WE NOW WERE SPEAKING IN AS LOW A VOICE AS POSSIBLE CAME FORWARD AND BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
HE UTTERED MANY FURIOUS PHRASES AND AMONG THEM SAID
THE BISHOP AND MESSER GUIDO WERE MUCH MORE FRIGHTENED THAN WAS NECESSARY
THE FALL WAS MORE THAN A MILE OF PRECIPITOUS DESCENT ABOVE THE WATERS OF THE LAKE
YET THEY HAVE BEEN WELL EXPENDED ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCIES HAVE BESTOWED SUCH PRAISES ON IT
THE BISHOPS RAGE CONTINUED TO RISE
THEY SENT THEIR YOUNG MAN TO SIENA
THEREFORE HE WOULD HEAR NO MORE ABOUT IT
OUR ENEMIES THINKING THEY WERE SAFE CAME ON AT GREATER EASE AND IN A CLOSER BODY THAN USUAL
BUT NOT WANTING TO MAKE ANY MISTAKE I SHOWED THIS TO THE DUKE BEFORE I SEALED IT SAYING TO HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
AND THOUGH I GAVE THE RIGHT DATE OF THE YEAR 1544 FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTH WE WERE STILL IN 1543
THEN I ANSWERED
AND INDEED IT GAVE THAT GLORIOUS MONARCH NO LESS CONTENTMENT THAN THE ARTIST WHO HAD WORKED SO HARD UPON THEM DESIRED
BUT I ALSO MET WITH OTHERS REPUTED HONEST WHO DID ALL THEY COULD TO RUIN ME AND ROBBED ME GROSSLY
BUT IT BEING GOLD HIS HOLINESS MUST GIVE ME SOME OF THE METAL IF HE WANTED ME TO GET THROUGH WITH MY WORK
AND TELL ASCANIO THAT IF HE DOES NOT QUIT THAT HOUSE AT THE HOUR APPOINTED FOR HIS MASTER I WILL TREAT HIM MUCH IN THE SAME WAY. DON DIEGO MADE NO ANSWER BUT WENT AND INSPIRED SUCH TERROR IN FRANCESCO THAT HE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF
AND BEING THE MOST FAVOURED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS GENTLE MANNERS AND DISCRETION AMMANATO MADE THINGS EASY FOR HIM
ANOTHER OF HIS BROTHERS WAS A PHYSICIAN OF HIGH REPUTE AT FLORENCE
MEANWHILE I PUSHED MY MODEL FOR THE BUTTON FORWARD WITH ALL THE DILIGENCE I COULD CONSTRUCTING IT EXACTLY OF THE SIZE WHICH THE JEWEL ITSELF WAS MEANT TO HAVE
1 BENVENUTO WILL DEVOTE HIMSELF TO COMPLETING YOUR CHALICE AND YOU WILL GET TWO PIECES DONE IN THE SAME TIME
LI AFTER WE HAD BEEN ONE DAY IN ITALY THE COUNT GALEOTTO DELLA MIRANDOLA JOINED US
TO MAKE THE SUM CORRECT 5200 OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LENT THE DUKE
THUS THEN WITH GLADNESS AND GREAT ENJOYMENT WE BROUGHT OUR SUPPER-PARTY TO AN END
4 THUS WITH DESPAIR AT HEART I LEFT THEM AND BETOOK MYSELF TO BED
THE CASK WAS DISLODGED AS I PREDICTED AND FELL PRECISELY BETWEEN CARDINAL FARNESE AND MESSER JACOPO SALVIATI
THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO HIS PORTERS IN MY PRESENCE THAT IF I APPEARED AT THE PALACE THEY SHOULD ALWAYS ADMIT ME THROUGH HIS APARTMENTS TO THE PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE
OUR MOST CHRISTIAN MONARCH HAS OF HIS OWN ACCORD ASSIGNED YOU THE SAME APPOINTMENTS WHICH HIS MAJESTY ALLOWED THE PAINTER LIONARDO DA VINCI THAT IS A SALARY OF SEVEN HUNDRED CROWNS
CELLINI RETURNS TO THE YEAR 1535 WHEN CHARLES V
REACHING THE BANCHI WHERE THE GREAT SCRIMMAGE WAS AND SEEING BERTINO LIFTED FROM THE GROUND HE RAN TOWARDS HOME AND MET MY BROTHER CECCHINO ON THE WAY WHO ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
HE WAS THE ONLY GODFATHER
AND PERCEIVING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PICK A QUARREL WITH ME I TURNED INTO AN APOTHECARYS SHOP TILL THE STORM BLEW OVER
HIS HUMOURS GREW EXTRAVAGANT
ALL THIS WHILE I STAYED WITH SORRY CHEER IN BED AND WAS ATTENDED BY THAT MOST EXCELLENT MAN AND PHYSICIAN MAESTRO FRANCESCO DA MONTEVARCHI
I TOLD HIM THAT THE KING HAD GIVEN ME THE PLACE TO SERVE HIM IN AND THAT I DID NOT CHOOSE IT SHOULD BE OCCUPIED BY ANY BUT MYSELF AND MY ATTENDANTS
YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH. MEANWHILE AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT HE FELL AS I HAVE SAID HALF DEAD TO EARTH
SO THEN STILL LAUGHING WE SUMMONED OUR FORCES AND BENT OURSELVES TO MAKING THE ASCENT
SO WE TIED OUR APRONS BEHIND OUR BACKS AND TRUDGED ALMOST IN SILENCE TO SIENA
AND MESSER BENVEGNATO THE POPES CHAMBERLAIN WAS KICKED AND TRAMPLED BY HIS MULE
YOU BLOCKHEADS
AFTERWARDS HE WAS EMPLOYED UPON THE SCULPTURE OF THE SANTA CASA AT LORETO
I HAD AMONG MY FRIENDS A YOUNG GREEK OF THE AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
AND I STABBED HIM JUST BENEATH THE EAR
FOR WE ARE SURE THAT BENVENUTO IS AN HONEST FELLOW. THAT TRAITOR OF A MASTER BEING IN FACT MY ENEMY REPLIED
AH GOD I AM DROWNING! THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE FRIGHT HE HAD HAD
THEY WITHDREW AND WERE COMPELLED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO RELATE THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO MONSIGNOR
NOW THE HUSBAND OF THE GIRL TO PLEASE HIS WIFE BEGGED THE PRINCE TO HAVE ME TAKEN UP
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE DUCHESS SENT FOR ME AND ADVISED ME TO PUT MY DIFFERENCE WITH THE DUKE INTO HER HANDS SINCE SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD CONDUCT THE BUSINESS TO MY SATISFACTION
THIS YEAR I SHALL KEEP IT IN COMMUNION WITH GOD
LATER ON THEY SAY I LAY STILL LIKE ONE DEAD
I DREW FORTH MY PONIARD WITH ITS SCABBARD
FOR GOD WHO LOVES THE TRUTH PROTECTED ME AS HE HATH EVER SAVED ME FROM A SEA OF DREADFUL DANGERS AND I HOPE WILL SAVE ME TILL THE END OF THIS MY LIFE HOWEVER FULL OF TRIALS IT MAY BE
THE POPE GRANTED THIS WILLINGLY ADDING THAT HE WOULD ASSIST IN ITS RECOVERY
WITH HIS MAJESTY I DISPUTED SOME TIME ABOUT THE FASHION OF HIS COINAGE A POINT UPON WHICH WE WERE NOT OF THE SAME OPINION
MY DOG RETRIEVED THE ONE AND BROUGHT IT TO ME
BUT HE WISHED ME TO BRING WITH ME A LITTLE BOY OF PURE VIRGINITY
IL COLPO DI PAGOLO ERA ITO TANTO RITTO CHE NON ERA ISFANDATO NOTE 3
THEREUPON THEY QUICKLY WITHDREW THEIR HANDS AND ROSE FROM TABLE UTTERING SUCH GIBING WORDS AS ARE COMMONLY ADDRESSED TO YOUNG MEN OF EMINENT BEAUTY
YOU KNOW WELL THAT I WANT YOU TO SERVE ME; AND REACHING ME THE LILY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT AWAY
AND UNREPELLED BY THE TROUBLE WHICH IT GAVE ME I WENT ON ZEALOUSLY UPON THE PATH OF PROFIT AND IMPROVEMENT
A POX UPON OUR PECCADILLOES
HE WAS A PRELATE OF VAST WEALTH AND A GREAT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS
HE TOLD ME WITH A HANG-DOG LOOK AND A FEW BRIEF WORDS THAT I MIGHT WEAR IT FOR HIS EXCELLENCYS SAKE
MESSER LUCAGNOLO BENVENUTO BIDS ME SAY THAT HE HAS SENT TO SHOW YOU HIS PROMISES AND YOUR LUMBER EXPECTING IN RETURN TO SEE FROM YOU HIS GEWGAWS. THIS MESSAGE GIVEN LUCAGNOLO TOOK UP THE VASE AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED IT
IT WILL HOWEVER BE QUITE EASY FOR ME TO RESTORE IT. WHY THEN, SAID THE DUKE DID YOU NOT DEVISE IT SO THAT THE FOOT SHOULD COME OUT AS WELL AS YOU AFFIRM THE HEAD WILL? I ANSWERED
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE IT SUCH A LABOUR. ALL THE SAME HE KEPT ENTREATING ME TO EXECUTE THE PIECE IN STEEL EXCLAIMING
AND YOU WERE FOR MAKING THEM IMMORTAL FOR US! WITH MANY OTHER TIRESOME QUIPS OF THE SAME KIND
HE WAS A STAMPER IN THE SERVICE OF THE MINT NAMED CESARE MACHERONE AND A ROMAN CITIZEN
HAD I BUT LIGHT AH ME
IT WAS A LITTLE OBLONG BOX COPIED FROM THE PORPHYRY SARCOPHAGUS BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE ROTONDA
I HAD MORE TROUBLE IN LOOKING AFTER THIS MANS SAFETY THAN MY OWN
HE REPLIED
HE REPLIED
HE REPLIED
IF HIS MAJESTY REFUSED TO LET ME GO HE WOULD WITHOUT FAIL INFORM ME
MICHEL ANGELOS DAVID
THE POPE WAS ROUSED TO SUCH FURY BY THE JEALOUS FEAR HE HAD LEST I SHOULD GO AND TELL THE WHOLE WORLD HOW INFAMOUSLY I HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HE KEPT REVOLVING WAYS IN WHICH I MIGHT BE PUT TO DEATH WITHOUT INJURY TO HIS OWN CREDIT
THEN CREEPING ON ALL FOURS AS I WAS COMPELLED TO GO I CRAWLED UP TO AN ANGLE OF MY DUNGEON DOOR AND GNAWED A SPLINTER FROM IT WITH MY TEETH
MY FRIENDS WERE ANGRY AND WENT OFF MUTTERING
BUT BANDINELLO WRITHED AND MADE THE MOST UGLY FACES--HIS FACE ITSELF BEING BY NATURE HIDEOUS BEYOND MEASURE--WHICH COULD BE IMAGINED BY THE MIND OF MAN
AND I HAD HALF RESOLVED TO TAKE A LEAP AND HAZARD MY ESCAPE
THEN I ASCENDED THE SLOPE OF MONTUI AND IN ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES THERE I FOUND A MAN CALLED IL GRASSUCCIO OWN BROTHER TO MESSER BENEDETTO DA MONTE VARCHI
AND THIS BEING NOW VACANT THE CARDINAL REMINDED HIM OF HIS WORD
HIS SPRAWLING SHOULDERS ARE LIKE THE TWO POMMELS OF AN ASS PACK-SADDLE
THIS PAINTER IS CHIEFLY FAMOUS FOR HIS DESCENT FROM THE CROSS IN THE CHURCH OF THE TRINITà DE MONTI AT ROME
MARGARET IT WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN FIRST MARRIED TO THE DUC DALENCON AND AFTER HIS DEATH RETAINED HIS FIEFS
I HAD RECKONED UPON BEING WELL PROVIDED WITH A YOUNG WOMAN OF CONSIDERABLE BEAUTY CALLED PANTASILEA WHO WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH ME
HE ADMIRED IT EXTREMELY AND GAVE ORDERS TO HIS SECRETARY TO PAY ME ALL THE MONEY I HAD SPENT UPON IT BE THE SUM WHAT IT MIGHT PROVIDED I WROTE THE BILL OUT IN MY OWN HAND
ON GRIEVOUS THOUGHTS AND CARES OF HOME MUST BROOD OPPRESSED WITH CARKING PAINS IN FLESH AND BONE FAR FROM HIS NATIVE LAND FULL MANY A ROOD
WITHIN THREE DAYS TWO THINGS HAPPENED EACH OF WHICH BROUGHT MY LIFE INTO EXTREME HAZARD
CXXVII A FEW DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA ARRIVED IN ROME
AND UNLESS WE KNOW THE EXACT MONTH IN WHICH AN EVENT TOOK PLACE WE CANNOT TRANSLATE ANY HOUR INTO TERMS OF OUR OWN SYSTEM
AT LAST HOWEVER THE DUKE COMPELLED HIM TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS WHICH CAUSED THE OLD MAN SUCH ANGUISH THAT HE SICKENED OF A DANGEROUS COLIC AND WAS BROUGHT TO DEATHS DOOR
WHAT GREATER AND MORE HONOURABLE PRIZE COULD BE DESIRED BY ME
THEN THEY BEGAN TO DISCUSS THE DOWRY WHICH LED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FRIENDLY DIFFERENCE
WALKING WITH ALL HASTE I PASSED THE BRIDGE OF THE EXCHANGE 1 AND WENT UP ALONG A WALL BESIDE THE RIVER WHICH LED TO MY LODGING IN THE CASTLE
NICOLAS SCHOMBERG A LEARNED DOMINICAN AND DISCIPLE OF SAVONAROLA MADE ARCHBISHOP OF CAPUA IN 1520
WHEN THAT BIG BRUTE OF A CAPTAIN HEARD THESE WORDS HE REPLIED WITH INSULTS AND I RETORTED IN THE SAME TONE
MY LORD THIS CITY OF A TRUTH HAS EVER BEEN THE SCHOOL OF THE MOST NOBLE TALENTS
I REMAINED CREDITOR TO THE MINT IN A MATTER OF MORE THAN SEVENTY CROWNS ON ACCOUNT OF DIES SUPPLIED BY ME
WHEN I SAW THE THING I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING GENTLY IN MY SLEEVE
AND SO WE WENT OFF TALKING PLEASANTLY UNTIL THEY BROUGHT ME TO THE GOVERNOR OF ROME WHO WAS CALLED IL MAGALOTTO
XC WHEN THE DUKE WAS INFORMED THAT THE WHOLE OF MY WORK FOR THE PERSEUS COULD BE EXHIBITED AS FINISHED HE CAME ONE DAY TO LOOK AT IT
THE DUCHESS WAS WROUGHT UP TO SUCH AN ENTHUSIASM THAT SHE CRIED OUT
THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED NO ORDERS TO THAT EFFECT
LORO PRETI PERHAPS THEIR PRIESTS XXXVII I PURSUED MY BUSINESS OF ARTILLERYMAN AND EVERY DAY PERFORMED SOME EXTRAORDINARY FEAT WHEREBY THE CREDIT AND THE FAVOUR I ACQUIRED WITH THE POPE WAS SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLE
FERRI I HAVE TRANSLATED THIS WORD DIES BUT IT SEEMS TO MEAN ALL THE COINING INSTRUMENTS STAMPE OR CONII BEING THE DIES PROPER
AND ON MAKING DEXTEROUS INQUIRIES I WAS TOLD THE WHOLE BUT NOT THE NAME OF MY CALUMNIATOR
CIV DURING MY PROMENADE THROUGH THE MARKET I MET GIOVAN BATTISTA SANTINI AND HE AND I WERE TAKEN BACK TO SUPPER BY THE PRIEST
HE ACQUIRED THAT THUMPING FEE FOR HIS COMMISSION AND TO BOOT THEIR FAVOUR
HE SAT UPON THE BOARD WHICH INCLUDED AVERARDO SERRISTORI AND FEDERIGO DE RICCI
BEING THE EXCELLENT SERVANT WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AND SHOWING MARVELLOUS APTITUDE FOR OUR ART I FELT A WARM AND FATHERLY AFFECTION FOR HIM AND KEPT HIM CLOTHED AS IF HE HAD BEEN MY OWN SON
LXXIII IN THE MEANWHILE MY ENEMIES HAD PROCEEDED SLOWLY TOWARD CHIAVICA AS THE PLACE WAS CALLED AND HAD ARRIVED AT THE CROSSING OF SEVERAL ROADS GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
ALSO THAT IT WAS A DUTY NAY A PRECEPT FROM GOD HIMSELF THAT HE WHO HATH SHOULD GIVE TO HIM WHO HATH NOT
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BENVENUTO WAS FORMERLY WITHOUT HIS PEER IN THIS ART
MY ADVERSARIES TOOK TO FLIGHT
THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF WINE WHICH HE HAD DRUNK WAS ALSO OPERATING
WELL I KNOW THAT BY THE LAWS OF HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY BOTH AGENT AND PATIENT IN THIS KIND OF CRIME ARE PUNISHED WITH THE STAKE
LXXXV MY SICKNESS HAD BEEN OF SUCH A VERY SERIOUS NATURE THAT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FLING IT OFF
RETURNING THANKS TO GOD FOR THIS AND EVERY OTHER DISPENSATION AND HOPING TO BE LEFT AWHILE WITHOUT WORRIES I BADE THE YOUNG MEN OF MY HOUSEHOLD ESPECIALLY THE ITALIANS FOR GODS SAKE TO ATTEND EACH DILIGENTLY TO THE WORK I SET HIM AND TO HELP ME TILL SUCH TIME AS I COULD FINISH THE THINGS I HAD IN HAND
PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN I DREW MY SWORD AND SET THE POINT OF IT AT HIS THROAT NOT GIVING HIM THE TIME TO THINK WHETHER HE TOO CARRIED STEEL
ESSERSI FATTO UN MIGLIACCIO NOTE 2
THESE VASES WERE IN QUITE A DIFFERENT FASHION FROM ANY WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN UP TO THAT DATE
HE ANSWERED CHEERFULLY
THIS DID NOT HOWEVER HAPPEN TO ME
HE FURTHERMORE COMMISSIONED ME TO EXECUTE A GOLDEN BELT WHICH I ENRICHED WITH GEMS AND DELICATE MASKS AND OTHER FANCIES
VINZENZIO DANTI OF PERUGIA ANOTHER IN THE HOUSE OF MESSER OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI
I HAVE TRANSLATED SPAZZATURE BY SWEEPINGS IT MEANS ALL REFUSE OF THE PRECIOUS METALS LEFT IN GOLDSMITHS TRAYS
HE WORKED UNDER BANDINELLI AND SANSOVINO
AND SO I WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF THE FESTIVAL SUCCEEDING TO THE JOY OF EVERYBODY
I BEGGED HER ALSO TO WARN HIM NOT TO LEND SO READY AN EAR TO BANDINELLOS EVIL TONGUE WHICH HINDERED ME FROM FINISHING MY PERSEUS
LII WHEN I RETURNED TO MY INN I FOUND THAT THE DUKE HAD SENT ME ABUNDANCE TO EAT AND DRINK OF VERY EXCELLENT QUALITY
FOR ANOTHER I WAS UNMASKING HIM TO THE DUKE AND ALL THE PEOPLE PRESENT WHO SHOWED BY FACE AND GESTURE FIRST THEIR SURPRISE AND NEXT THEIR CONVICTION THAT WHAT I SAID WAS TRUE
THE POPES MANDATARY CAME TOGETHER WITH TWO GREAT GENTLEMEN OF THE CARDINALS AND WHEN FOUR OCLOCK OF THE NIGHT WAS PASSED THEY REMOVED ME FROM MY PRISON AND BROUGHT ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE CARDINAL WHO RECEIVED ME WITH INDESCRIBABLE KINDNESS
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT. FELICE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE
IN THE WHOLE CITY OF FLORENCE THERE NEVER WAS BORN IN MY BELIEF A MAN OF SUCH IRRELIGION OR OF SUCH SORDID AVARICE. GIOVIO CONFIRMS THE STATEMENT
SUCH POWER OVER ME HAS THAT NAME OF ANGELICA THAT I AM NOW DETERMINED TO PUT UP AT YOUR INN. WE RODE ON ALL TOGETHER WITH MINE HOST INTO THE TOWN OF NAPLES AND DESCENDED AT HIS HOUSE
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF DUKE ALESSANDRO
LOOK TO IT THEN THAT YOU KEEP HIM ALWAYS GOING SO THAT I MAY FIND THE CHALICE FINISHED ON MY RETURN. THAT BEAST OF A CARDINAL SENT FOR ME AFTER EIGHT DAYS BIDDING ME BRING THE PIECE UP
BUT I REMAINED FOR SEVERAL DAYS EXPOSED TO GRIEVOUS ANNOYANCES FOR THE PROVOST WAS A GREAT NOBLEMAN OF PARIS AND ALL THE OTHER GENTLEFOLK TOOK PART AGAINST ME
HE RESIGNED IT IN FAVOUR OF PIETRO CORNARO OF VENICE IN 1535
I FELT IMMEDIATELY RELIEVED AND IN THE SPACE OF TWO DAYS THE SPLINTER CAME AWAY AND I REMAINED WITH EYESIGHT GREATLY IMPROVED
ACCORDINGLY I SAID THAT IT WAS WORTH EXACTLY TWO HUNDRED CROWNS
THE DUKE HEARD OF THIS AND MADE HIS ENTRANCE SOONER THAN USUAL
THIS MAN WAS A MEMBER OF A VERY NOBLE FERRARESE FAMILY AND MUCH ESTEEMED FOR HIS OFFICIAL TALENTS
THERE WAS THEN AT FLORENCE A SCULPTOR CALLED IL TRIBOLINO AND WE WERE GOSSIPS FOR I HAD STOOD GODFATHER TO HIS SON
TELL ME THEN FRANKLY HOW THE MATTER WENT AND WHO RENDERED YOU ASSISTANCE
MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI WHO FELT ASHAMED DID NOT VISIT ME AGAIN
HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
COME AS MANY OF YOU THIEVES AS LIKE AN INCH NEARER TO THIS WICKET AND ILL BLOW ALL THEIR BRAINS OUT WITH MY GUN. THEN I TURNED THE MUZZLE TOWARD THEIR MAJOR-DOMO AND MAKING AS THOUGH I WOULD DISCHARGE IT CALLED OUT
AND THROWING THE GOLD UPON THE COALS IT GRADUALLY SANK THROUGH AND DROPPED INTO THE PAN
I AM CALLED BENVENUTO CELLINI SON OF MAESTRO GIOVANNI SON OF ANDREA SON OF CRISTOFANO CELLINI
NOW AT THE LAST HAVING BEEN TAUGHT THAT GOD IS NOT INCLINED TO MAKE ME WORTHY OF SO GLORIOUS A SERVICE I BESEECH YOUR MAJESTY INSTEAD OF THE NOBLE RECOMPENSE YOU HAD IN MIND TO GIVE ME FOR MY LABOURS BESTOW UPON ME ONLY ONE SMALL TRIFLE OF YOUR FAVOUR AND THEREWITH THE LEAVE TO QUIT YOUR KINGDOM
BUT THAT IF I HAD COMPLETED THOSE EXTENSIVE WORKS BEGUN FOR THE KING I SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO QUIT ANY GREAT PRINCE MERELY TO ENTER HIS EXCELLENCYS SERVICE
AFFLICTED REGENTS OF MY SOUL
BENVENUTO YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG JOURNEY AT GREAT CHARGES TO YOUR LOSS
NEVERTHELESS I OUGHT TO SAY THAT THE CASTELLANS PARASITES WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM TO HANG ME FROM THE BATTLEMENT WHENCE I HAD MADE MY ESCAPE WHEN THEY SAW THAT HE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND TO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE PREVIOUSLY THREATENED WERE UNABLE TO ENDURE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
I HAD COVERED THE IRON SKELETON WITH CLAY WHICH I MODELLED LIKE AN ANATOMICAL SUBJECT AND ABOUT HALF AN INCH THINNER THAN THE BRONZE WOULD BE
THE WORTHY OLD MAN SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
AS SOON AS I HAVE GOT MY PARDON I WILL LEAVE ALL THE DEVOTION OF ROME 4 TO A PUPIL OF MINE THERE AND WILL COME BACK WITH YOUR EXCELLENCYS GOOD PERMISSION TO YOU. DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE LORENZINO DE MEDICI WHOM I HAVE ABOVE MENTIONED WAS PRESENT AND NO ONE ELSE
HE HAS ESCAPED FROM THE CASTLE AND IS CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
FOR I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO EXECUTE A GREAT WORK OF MY KING AND WANT SOME OF MY OWN FLORENTINES TO HELP ME
AN INVECTIVE AGAINST PIER LUIGI FARNESE
THE MERCHANT OFFERS THEM FOR SIX THOUSAND CROWNS
THE SPIRITS OF HIS SOUL
I DO NOT WANT MY FEE FOR INFORMATION
BACCIO BANDINELLO THE SCULPTOR AND A GREAT RIVAL OF CELLINIS AS WILL APPEAR IN THE ENSUING PAGES WAS BORN IN 1487 AND RECEIVED THE HONOUR OF KNIGHTHOOD FROM CLEMENT VII AND CHARLES V
1 IT WAS A LOAD OF BRICKS
YET I RESOLVED TO HOPE THAT HE WOULD PAY ME WHEN HE HAD THE POWER TO DO SO
1 AND THIS MAN BEING A FRIEND OF MY ENEMIES PUT IN
HAVING REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT I OUGHT ABSOLUTELY TO TURN BACK HE WENT ONWARD WITH THE POST WHILE I BEING INFLUENCED BY MY COMPANIONS COULD NOT MAKE MY MIND UP TO RETURN
GIVE CLOSE ATTENTION TO MY MEANING BECAUSE THE AFFAIR IS SERIOUS. HE MADE AS THOUGH HE WOULD RISE FORM THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE WAS SITTING SINCE HE SAW MY COLOUR HEIGHTENED AND MY FEATURES GREATLY DISCOMPOSED
DEAREST BROTHER THEY ARE PLOTTING MY RUIN
THOUGH I HAD PREPARED THE ARQUEBUSE FOR MY DEFENCE I HAD NOT YET LEVELLED IT EXACTLY AT HIM
7 SOME OF THE OTHER BOMBARDIERS WERE BEHAVING IN LIKE MANNER
HIS COMRADES IN LIEU OF HELPING HIM TURNED TO FLY
ALESSANDRO WAS THE REPUTED BASTARD OF LORENZO DUKE OF URBINO GRANDSON OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
AND THERE HE WISHED TO MAKE ME CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY BUT I WAS UNWILLING AT THE MOMENT SAYING THAT I WANTED FIRST TO GO AND SEE MY FATHER AND TO REDEEM THE BAN WHICH WAS STILL IN FORCE AGAINST ME AT FLORENCE
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MUCH TO BOAST OF AGAINST US EVEN IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED MEN TO BACK YOU. I RECOGNISED THE TRUTH OF HIS WORDS AND HAD INDEED MADE UP MY MIND TO DIE AMONG THEM
AS I HAD PARTLY GUESSED IT MIGHT BE SO MY GRIEF WAS NOT SO GREAT AS IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
AND THOUGH THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS WITH SPIRIT YET TWO HORSES WHICH HAD TAKEN FRIGHT IN THE TUMULT CAST THEM INTO SUCH DISORDER THAT A COUPLE OF THE BEST RIDERS WERE THROWN AND THE REMAINDER TOOK TO FLIGHT
AND YOU WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY AGAINST MY WORK? I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE TO HEAR ME OUT. GO ALONG THEN, HE REPLIED
AMONG OTHERS PIER LANDI WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
HE WOULD NOT SAY MORE THAN THAT HE KNEW VERY WELL ALL ABOUT IT
FOR THE REST I KNEW OF NOTHING THAT COULD HARM ME
ACCORDINGLY I BEGAN TO SPEAK AND SAID
GREAT WAS THE ASTONISHMENT OF MESSER PIETRO WHO CONCEIVED THAT I SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED THE WAXEN MODEL IN TWO HOURS AND THE STEEL IN TEN WHEN HE FOUND THAT I EMPLOYED TWO HUNDRED ON THE WAX AND THEN WAS BEGGING FOR LEAVE TO PURSUE MY JOURNEY TOWARD FRANCE
IT HAPPENED THEN THAT SLEEPING IN THE SAME BED AS AN EXCELLENT WORKMAN NAMED MANNO WHO WAS IN MY SERVICE WHEN HE MEANT TO SCRATCH HIMSELF HE TORE THE SKIN FROM ONE OF MANNOS LEGS WITH HIS FILTHY CLAWS THE NAILS OF WHICH HE NEVER USED TO CUT
THEN PUTTING ON MY ARMS AND GIRDING MY SWORD I WENT TO SAN PIERO AND KISSED THE FEET OF THE DEAD POPE NOT WITHOUT SHEDDING TEARS
1 I OFTEN TOLD THEM NOT TO SHOW THEMSELVES SINCE THEIR NASTY RED CAPS GAVE A FAIR MARK TO OUR ENEMIES
DON GIOVANNI WAS TEN DON GARZIA WAS SIX AND DON FERDINANDO FOUR
FRANCESCO DA SAN GALLO WAS THE SON OF GIULIANO AND NEPHEW OF ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO
CXII MANY WEEKS PASSED BUT OF ME NOTHING MORE WAS SPOKEN
I TOLD HIM THAT BY THE KINGS AUTHORITY GIVEN TO ME NEITHER HE NOR VILLEROIS COULD DO IT
FOR THE CASTELLAN ON THAT SIDE OF THE FORTRESS HAD BUILT TWO LOFTY WALLS THE SPACE BETWEEN WHICH HE USED FOR STABLE AND HENYARD
THIS GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF FEELING HER BODY AND DISCOVERING THE REAL SEX OF THE SUPPOSED WOMAN
AT TIMES I SANG AT TIMES I PRAYED AND AT TIMES I WROTE BY MEANS OF THE PASTE OF BRICK-DUST I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE
AND AS HE WAS A PLEASANT FELLOW HE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND SING
I FREQUENTLY REPLIED THAT EVERYBODY NAY ALL ITALY KNEW WELL I WAS AN EXCELLENT GOLDSMITH
FOR IF HE IS A PERSON WORTHY TO BE HELPED I CAN TEACH HIM A SECRET WHICH MAY CURE HIM OF THAT INFIRMITY. THE POPE REPLIED
WOULD GOD THAT WE HAD NEVER COME HERE! AND TURNED IN MADDEST HASTE TO FLY
AH DIRTY COWARDS
ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE LOGS TOOK FIRE OH
AFTERWARDS I MADE DIES FOR THE GOLDEN CROWNS
THE WINDOWS BEING CLOSED SIGNOR ORAZIO CONCLUDED THAT A BAND OF SOLDIERS WERE CAROUSING AT TABLE JUST BETWEEN THEM AND BEHIND THE SUN
I MADE THE QUARREL UP AND AFTERWARDS GOT GIORGIO INTO CARDINAL DE MEDICIS HOUSEHOLD AND CONTINUALLY HELPED HIM
ILL FLY
THE KING WAS EXCEEDINGLY DELIGHTED WITH THE GIFT
FOR GENIUS AND TALENT AT THEIR BIRTH COME INTO THIS WORLD LEAN AND SCABBY
MOVED TO COMPASSION BY HIS GREAT TALENTS BY THE LOVE OF MY FATHERLAND AND BY MY OWN NATURAL TENDERNESS OF HEART I TOOK HIM INTO MY HOUSE AND HAD HIM MEDICALLY TREATED IN SUCH WISE THAT BEING BUT A YOUTH HE SOON REGAINED HIS HEALTH
E VINCENZIO ROMOLI
I HELD HIM BACK AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE
I ENTERED AND PAULINO FOLLOWED WITH THE SILVER VASE
NEVERTHELESS THY WILL BE DONE. MEANWHILE THE MEN WERE CARRYING ME AWAY WITH A GREAT LIGHTED TORCH
YET I GOT WHAT I COULD OUT OF THE PIECE--THAT IS THE APOLLO AND HYACINTH WHICH MAY STILL BE SEEN UNFINISHED IN MY WORKSHOP
ACCORDINGLY I KEPT THESE PIECES ALWAYS GOING AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOLD WAS BEING MELTED DOWN
THIS DUTY OCCURS TO MY OWN MIND NOW THAT I AM TRAVELLING BEYOND THE TERM OF FIFTY-EIGHT YEARS AND AM IN FLORENCE THE CITY OF MY BIRTH
THIS CAPITOLO I WRITE TO LUCA MARTIN ADDRESSING HIM IN IT AS WILL APPEAR 1 WHOSO WOULD KNOW THE POWER OF GODS DOMINION AND HOW A MAN RESEMBLES THAT HIGH GOOD MUST LIE IN PRISON IS MY FIRM OPINION
NICCOLò BENINTENDI WHO HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE EIGHT IN 1529 WAS EXILED BY THE MEDICI IN 1530
LAWS CANNOT BE IMPOSED ON HIM WHO IS THE MASTER OF THE LAW. SO THEY LEFT ME ALONE AND GAVE ME NO FURTHER ANNOYANCE
THE HOUSE OF PICO LOST THEIR LORDSHIP OF MIRANDOLA IN 1536 WHEN GALEOTTO PICO TOOK REFUGE WITH HIS SONS IN FRANCE
AND THAT IF HE WANTS TO CONFER THE POST ON ME AGAIN NOTHING WILL INDUCE ME TO ACCEPT IT. THE GRACELESS AND UNLUCKY FELLOW WENT OFF LIKE AN ARROW TO FIND THE POPE AND REPORT THIS CONVERSATION
CELLINI MEANS PALLAVICINI
HE ANSWERED LAUGHINGLY
BUT ON REFLECTION THAT THE POPE WAS PROBABLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AFFAIR HE PASSED IT OVER LIGHTLY AFTER GIVING HIS ATTENTION TO THE INCIDENT
FOR HEAVENS SAKE BENVENUTO DO NOT RISK THE FURY OF THESE MAD BEASTS. TO WHICH I REPLIED
ONE OF THE LATTER WAS MADAME MADDALENA WIFE TO M
SUCH BEING THE CASE I RECOMMEND MYSELF TO YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY. LXXXIV THE DUKE WAS NOW AWARE THAT ALL MY PREVIOUS SPEECHES HAD BEEN AS IT WERE FORCED OUT OF ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE I AM NOT GIVEN TO THOSE EVIL WAYS
WE FOUND THE COURT OF THE KING AT FONTANA BELIò
THUS MY WRETCHED MALADY WENT DRAGGING ON AND I GOT BUT LITTLE BETTER
HE TOOK REFUGE ON THE INSTANT IN THE MINT
A PART OF MICHEL ANGELOS ENGRAVED BY SCHIAVONETTI AND A TRANSCRIPT BY RUBENS FROM LIONARDOS CALLED THE BATTLE OF THE STANDARD
THE POPE WITH A SHREWD INSTINCT SENT FOR MESSER ANTONIO SANTACROCE THE NOBLEMAN WHO AS I HAVE SAID WAS CHIEF AND COMMANDER OF THE GUNNERS
IT STILL REMAINS THE CHIEF MONUMENT OF GIULIO ROMANOS VERSATILE GENIUS
XXXVI WHILE THIS WORK WAS GOING FORWARD I SET ASIDE CERTAIN HOURS OF THE DAY FOR THE SALT-CELLAR AND CERTAIN OTHERS FOR THE JUPITER
AND AFTER THE TWO FESTIVALS WERE OVER I AGAIN PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE HIS HOLINESS
FAR FROM HAVING UTTERED THEM SUCH THINGS HAD NEVER COME INTO MY HEAD
IT MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN SOME VENOMOUS CATERPILLAR. I REPLIED
SUCH BEING THE CASE I OCCUPIED AN APARTMENT FAR AWAY FROM MY WORKMENS ROOMS AS WELL AS FROM THE SHOP
HIS OWN LODGING AND PANTASILEAS HOUSE WERE IN THE QUARTER OF THE BIANCHI WHERE ARE NOW THE VIA GIULIA AND VIA DE BANCHI VECCHI
SINCE THEY WERE LOOKING TOWARDS THE MINT AND FIXING THEIR EYES ON BERNARDONE HIS SON MAESTRO BACCIO TAKING NOTICE OF THEIR GESTURES TORE THE PAPER DOWN WITH FURY
A MAN OF MY QUALITY DESERVED NO MEANER CATCHPOLES THAN YOUR LORDSHIPS
I THEN BEHOLDING HIM OUT OF DANGER CONGRATULATED THE MAN UPON MY HAVING BEEN THE MEANS OF RESCUING HIS LIFE
I ROSE UPON THE HOUR OF BREAKING FAST AND FELT TIRED FOR I HAD TRAVELLED MANY MILES THAT NIGHT AND WAS WANTING TO TAKE FOOD WHEN A CRUSHING HEADACHE SEIZED ME
THE FELLOW TRUE TO HIS FRENCH NATURE CRIED OUT IN FRENCH THAT I WAS A MAN OF POOR SPIRIT AND THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER WHATSOEVER
I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS WITH ALL DILIGENCE AND CONSTRUCTED THE WOODEN FRAMEWORK ACCORDING TO MY EXCELLENT SYSTEM
CII IT PLEASED GOD WHO RULES ALL THINGS FOR OUR GOOD--I MEAN FOR THOSE WHO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BELIEVE IN HIM
CXV AFTER MY CONVERSATION WITH THE GREEK THE WHOLE DAY WORE AWAY AND AT NIGHT THERE CAME ABUNDANT PROVISIONS FROM THE KITCHEN OF THE POPE
YOUR STATUE IS SPOILED AND THERE IS NO HOPE WHATEVER OF SAVING IT. NO SOONER HAD I HEARD THE SHRIEK OF THAT WRETCH THAN I GAVE A HOWL WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FROM THE SPHERE OF FLAME
THE WAXEN MODEL PRODUCED SO FINE AN EFFECT THAT WHEN THE DUKE SAW IT AND WAS STRUCK WITH ITS BEAUTY--WHETHER SOMEBODY HAD PERSUADED HIM IT COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE SAME FINISH IN METAL OR WHETHER HE THOUGHT SO FOR HIMSELF--HE CAME TO VISIT ME MORE FREQUENTLY THAN USUAL AND ON ONE OCCASION SAID
BUT HAVING BEEN ON BAD TERMS OTHERWISE WITH ME FOR SOME TIME PAST HE DID NOT CARE TO BE ENTANGLED ANYHOW IN MY AFFAIRS
SIMPERING AND SNIGGERING THEN HE BADE ME DRINK A GOOD CUP OF GREEK WINE KEEP MY SPIRITS UP AND NOT BE FRIGHTENED
1 THEN HE TURNED TO ONE OF HIS PEOPLE AND ORDERED HIM TO GO ON SUPPLYING ME WITH WORK FOR THE PALACE
I HAPPENED TO BE INTIMATE WITH ALESSANDRO THE SON OF PIERO DEL BENE WHO AT THE TIME WHEN THE COLONNESI ENTERED ROME HAD REQUESTED ME TO GUARD HIS PALACE
WHILE I WAS THUS SPEAKING MY LORD THE DUKE WRITHED ON HIS CHAIR AND SEEMED AS THOUGH HE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR ME TO THE END
AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
FIRST IT IS SORELY WANTED NOW FOR PUBLIC USES
DURING THIS SPEECH HE OFTENTIMES TURNED ROUND TO LOOK ME SHARPLY IN THE EYES
INSIDE AND OUT IT WAS AS BRIGHT AS ANY MIRROR
UPON THE RAMPARTS WHERE WE TOOK OUR STATION SEVERAL YOUNG MEN WERE LYING KILLED BY THE BESIEGERS
ONCE MORE THEN I TELL YOU THAT I FEEL QUITE ABLE TO EXECUTE THIS STATUE THREE TIMES BETTER THAN THE MODEL AS I HAVE BEFORE ENGAGED MY WORD. NOTE 1
BENVENUTO IN ORDER THAT HIS INTENTION MIGHT ESCAPE NOTICE AIMED AT A PIGEON WHICH WAS BROODING HIGH UP IN A HOLE OF THE PALACE AND HIT IT EXACTLY IN THE HEAD-A FEAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT INCREDIBLE
NOR DO I THINK THAT HE MEANT BY THIS BUMPTIOUSNESS OF HIS TO DO ME ANY HARM BUT ONLY THROUGH LIGHTHEADEDNESS AND SENSELESS FOLLY TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH HE ALSO HELD THE AFFAIRS OF ARTISTS WHOM THE KING WAS WANTING UNDER HIS OWN PERSONAL SUPERVISION JUST AS THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA DID
ACCORDINGLY HE SPOKE AS HE LOOKED
AND WHEN WE HAD REACHED A CERTAIN GENTLY RISING GROUND-NIGHT HAD ALREADY FALLEN-LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF FLORENCE BOTH WITH ONE BREATH EXCLAIMED IN THE UTMOST ASTONISHMENT
CAUTIOUSLY HE BEGAN TO ASK WHAT MEANS I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SUPPOSING MY JAILERS HAD LOCKED ME UP IN ORDER TO SET THE DUNGEON DOORS OPEN AND EFFECT MY FLIGHT
I WILL NEVER LEAVE MY MASTER MICHEL AGNOLOS SIDE TILL I SHALL HAVE FLAYED HIM OR HE SHALL HAVE FLAYED ME. THESE STUPID WORDS FORCED ME TO LAUGH AND WITHOUT SAYING FAREWELL I LOWERED MY SHOULDERS AND RETIRED
LOOK YOU NOW MY LORD
SEGNAR SETTE E TAGLIAR UNO A PROVERB DERIVED POSSIBLY FROM FELLING TREES
FOR HAVING TAKEN UP THE STUDY OF THIS ART TO PLEASE MYSELF HE WISHED ME TO INDULGE MY WHIM FOR DRAWING TO THE FULL
THE SON OF MOSCHINO BEGAN A THIRD AT PISA AND BARTOLOMMEO AMMANATO A FOURTH IN THE LOGGIA WHICH WE DIVIDED BETWEEN US
MY LORD YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY HAS TAUGHT ME SOMETHING EVEN IN MY OWN FINE ART OF STATUARY INASMUCH AS WE HAVE ALWAYS EXCHANGED IDEAS UPON THAT SUBJECT
LE VICOMTE DORBEC
SO MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY I PUT MY HORSE BOLDLY TO A SHARP TROT AND WITH GODS GRACE BEING SOMEHOW UNPERCEIVED BY THEM PASSED FREELY THROUGH
THIS MAN OF DELICATE HONOUR THEN CAME ONE EVENING ABOUT A HALF HOUR AFTER SUNSET IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AND INDUCED ME WITH THE STRONGEST PRESSURE TO DRAW UP THE CONTRACT THEN AND THERE
I DO NOT REFUSE HIM THE CREDIT OF BEING EXCELLENT AT STATUETTES IN MINIATURE
ACCORDINGLY WHEN I WAS AT THE DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED PACES FROM MY HOME I RAN WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE
AND ALMOST EVERY DAY WE MET TOGETHER IN MESSER GIOVANNIS COMPANY
1 HE WAS VERY CLEVER AT ENGRAVING CORNELIANS AND WAS MOREOVER A MOST INTELLIGENT JEWELLER AN OLD MAN AND OF GREAT CELEBRITY
HE WAS A COUSIN OF MARIA SALVIATI COSIMOS MOTHER
THE MASTER WOULD NOT MOVE TO PLEASE THE POPE BECAUSE HE HAS GOT A WENCH IN BED WITH HIM WHOM HE HAS BEEN WANTING THIS LONG WHILE. THEN HE ASKED ME FOR A TIP AND I GAVE HIM A FEW VENETIAN COPPERS AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE THE BARGE-MAN WAIT TILL I HAD FOUND MY SLIPPERS AND RETURNED
BOTH OF THEM PUT IN THAT THEY HAD SEVERAL EXCELLENT DESIGNS READY
NEXT I SET ABOUT TO CAST IT IN BRONZE
TAKING THE ROAD TOWARD FLORENCE JUST WHEN I ENTERED THE PIAZZA OF SAN DOMENICO BANDINELLO WAS ARRIVING FROM THE OTHER SIDE
TELL ME BENVENUTO MINUTELY IN WHAT CONSISTS THE SKILL OF THIS OLD MASTER WHICH SO EXCITES YOUR ADMIRATION. I THEN ATTEMPTED AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE BEAUTY OF WORKMANSHIP THE CONSUMMATE SCIENCE AND THE RARE MANNER DISPLAYED BY THE FRAGMENT
GIOVIO IN HIS LIFE OF THE CARDINAL PROSPERO COLONNA RELATES HOW HE ACCOMPANIED CLEMENT IN HIS FLIGHT FROM THE VATICAN TO THE CASTLE

BURSTING THEN INTO SUCH A FURIOUS STORM OF RAGE THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED SHE CRIED OUT

THEN I WENT TO THE KING WHO DISBURSED THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WEIGHT OF SILVER IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE UNDERTAKING
2 HE TOO WAS A FLORENTINE
AND SO WE WENT ON BY THE HELP OF GOD
BUT AFTER LOSING HIS WIFE TOOK ORDERS AND RECEIVED THE HAT IN 1517
JUST BELOW THE PLACE OUR BOATMEN HAD TAKEN UP THEIR STATION
WHY DO NOT YOU FINISH YOUR WORK
IT OUGHT INDEED TO HAVE WORKED QUITE THE OTHER WAY HE BEING A PEASANTS SON FROM IESI
IT WAS ON A DAY IN APRIL AFTER DINNER AND THE WEATHER VERY FINE
JUST THEN THE GUARD OF THE BARGELLO PASSED BY
I SEASONED WHAT I HAD TO SAY WITH THAT PART OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH BELONGS TO OUR PROFESSION
THERE I PUT MY BUNDLE OF LINEN LINES DOWN UPON THE GROUND MEANING TO FASTEN THEM ROUND A BATTLEMENT AND DESCEND THE LESSER AS I HAD THE GREATER HEIGHT
FRANçOIS DE BOURBON COMTE DE SAINT PAUL ONE OF THE CHIEF COMPANIONS IN ARMS AND CAPTAINS OF FRANçOIS I
MAESTRO GIACOMO WAS USING SOME COARSE STEEL INSTRUMENTS
THESE WERE THE TWO MEN WHO HAD BEEN WITH ME IN ROME AND WHOM I HAD TAKEN WITH ME ON THE JOURNEY
1 I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
AND BEGGED ME TO MAKE A DESIGN AND TO LOSE NO TIME ABOUT IT
AT THE VERY LEAST TWICE A WEEK
THE KING HEARD THE WHOLE HISTORY AND MADAME DETAMPES WAS WELL LAUGHED AT IN THEIR COMPANY
CELLINI HAS BEEN SEVERELY TAXED FOR LEAVING FLORENCE AT THIS JUNCTURE AND TAKING SERVICE UNDER POPE CLEMENT THE OPPRESSOR OF HER LIBERTIES
I CANNOT HOPE TO FIND POSSESSORS OF IT WORTHIER THAN YOU ARE
BENVENUTO AMUSE YOURSELF FOR A FEW DAYS MAKE GOOD CHEER AND SPEND YOUR TIME IN PLEASURE
THEY MUST NOW BRING ME OTHERS OF A FINER FABRIC AND I WOULD ALWAYS SEND BACK THE DIRTY ONES
AND EACH WORD TO THEM I DID REPEAT RECKLESS IF BUT GRIEFS LOAD FROM ME WERE ROLLED
THEREFORE HE NOW ASKED FOR HIM IN THE QUALITY OF HIS OWN MAN
HE RECEIVED THE HAT IN 1528 WHILE YET A LAYMAN AND THE BISHOPRIC OF BRESCIA IN 1531
HE RECEIVED THE HAT IN 1528 WHILE YET A LAYMAN AND THE BISHOPRIC OF BRESCIA IN 1531
I WAS RESOLVED TO SEEK REDRESS BUT ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO DO SO BY THE WAY OF JUSTICE
BUT NOT TO BE TOO PROLIX I WILL PASS THEM OVER
AND WE ALSO TOOK A CERTAIN AGNOLINO GADDI WHO WAS A VERY INTIMATE FRIEND OF BOTH
ALL AROUND I SET A CROWD OF CHERUBS IN DIVERS ATTITUDES ADAPTED TO THE OTHER GEMS
WHEN THEN I FOUND HIM SO HONEST IN HIS DEALINGS I FELT INCLINED TO RAISE HIS PENSION
THE CASTELLAN HAD GONE OFF INTO ONE OF HIS WORST FITS OF FRENZY
ACCORDINGLY WE STRUCK THE BARGAIN SO
OF THIS I HAD FULL PROOF AT THE TIME OF A GREAT INUNDATION OF THE ARNO WHEN THE RIVER ROSE TO THE HEIGHT OF MORE THAN A CUBIT AND A HALF IN MY WORKSHOP
WE WERE TEN MEN ALL COUNTED
ACCORDINGLY WHEN I NOTICED ONE DAY THAT HIS DEFENCE WAS FEEBLE I ENTERED THE HOUSE BY FORCE AND EXPELLED THE FELLOW TURNING ALL HIS GOODS AND CHATTELS INTO THE STREET
HE HAD BEEN BANISHED IN 1530 AS A FOE TO THE MEDICEAN HOUSE
HIS DESPATCHES FORM A VALUABLE SERIES OF HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS
BENVENUTO MEANS WELCOME
YET HE WAS DYING WITH IMPATIENCE TO SEE THE CHALICE AND COMMISSIONED MESSER RUBERTO PUCCI TO GIVE HEED TO WHAT I WAS ABOUT
THIS GAVE ME GREAT JOY ON THE ONE SIDE BUT WAS HALF UNWELCOME TO ME ON THE OTHER MERELY BECAUSE I HAD TOLD THE DUKE THAT IT COULD NOT COME OUT
A CROWD OF THEM COLLECTED ALL LOOKING AT ME AS A SORT OF MIRACLE
WHEN IT ARRIVED I THOUGHT IT A SIN TO CUT IT UP FOR THE HEAD AND ARMS AND OTHER BITS WANTING IN THE GANYMEDE
IF YOU DARE TO DRAW ILL KILL YOU ON THE SPOT. HE HAD TWO SERVANTS TO BACK HIM AND I HAD MY TWO LADS
THIS SPEECH ANNOYED THE DUKE SO MUCH THAT HE SENT FOR HIS TREASURER AND SCOLDED HIM MORE SHARPLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
1 THIS HE DID UNASKED
BUT HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE ME TO LEAVE THE BEATEN TRACK PURSUED BY SUCH AS FABRICATED THESE THINGS
ALL AT ONCE HE BURST OUT
MESSER GABRIELLO PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD MODEL AN AMPHITRITE THE WIFE OF NEPTUNE TOGETHER WITH THOSE TRITONS OF THE SEA AND MANY SUCH-LIKE FANCIES GOOD ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE IN WORDS BUT NOT TO EXECUTE IN METAL
MY FATHER SAID
THE DUKE LOOKED UP DELIGHTED AND EXCLAIMED
THE POPE WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD HIM IN HIS SERVICE BUT HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NOT TAKE SERVICE WITH ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AND THAT WHOSO HAD NEED OF HIM MIGHT COME TO SEEK HIM OUT
THE HIGH WORDS THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH I WELL KNOW WHAT THEY WERE I WILL NOT HERE RELATE BECAUSE I MAKE NO PROFESSION OF WRITING HISTORY
NOW LET US START. I WRAPPED HIS HEAD IN A LARGE KIND OF NAPKIN WHICH IS CALLED IN ROME A SUMMER-CLOTH
THE OTHER FIGURES EMBODY THOSE ARTS AND SCIENCES IN WHICH YOUR MAJESTY TAKES PLEASURE AND WHICH YOU SO GENEROUSLY PATRONISE
THEY TRAVELLED THROUGH THE SIENESE MAREMMA AND BY THIS ROUTE HE REACHED PISA
AND ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS CONVERSATION WITH ANTONIO LANDI HE SHOWED ME ONE DAY AFTER DINNER THE DIAMOND IN QUESTION WHICH I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISED BY ITS DESCRIPTION BOTH AS TO FORM AND WEIGHT
5 I TOLD THEM THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ADVISED THE DUKE TO PURCHASE IT
BUT THIS LITTLE GLEAM OF ENCOURAGEMENT INSPIRED ME WITH SOME HOPE OF LIVING
TO THE STAKE WITH THEM! THE COWARD ON THE BENCH FINDING THAT THE MATTER WAS NOT GOING AS HE INTENDED BEGAN TO USE SOFT WORDS AND EXCUSE THE WEAKNESS OF THE FEMALE SEX
BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS GIOVANNI TOOK HIS WIFE AND NEVER ASKED FOR OTHER PORTION WITH HER
AND I AM SURE THAT MY MOULD WILL FILL MIRACULOUSLY
I NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND NEVER INJURED YOU BUT SHOULD BE WELL DISPOSED TO DO YOU SERVICE. HE REPLIED IN A HIGH-SPIRITED WAY WITHOUT HOWEVER MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO PASS THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS SAYING
IT IS ONLY PEACE AND NOTHING ELSE WE ASK OF YOU. ACCORDINGLY HE PROMISED THAT THE GOVERNOR OF ROME AND HIS CATCHPOLES SHOULD GIVE ME NO TROUBLE
FROM A LETTER OF VARCHI TO BEMBO WE LEARN THAT CELLINI REACHED FLORENCE NOVEMBER 9 1535
THIS SER BENEDETTO HAD BEEN VERY MANY YEARS AT NAPLES
HE ALSO AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CARPENTERING
WHEREVER I GO AND WHEREVER I MAY END MY DAYS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE THEM
AND WHEN SHE HAD UTTERED MANY EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE EXCUSES THEY MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CONSTRUED INTO ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE ME TO QUARRY A BLOCK OF MARBLE TO MY TASTE AND THEN TO EXECUTE THE WORK
IL Y A LONGTEMPS QUE JE L AI VU! I THINK CELLINI PROBABLY MEANT TO HINT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE
I SAID THIS IN THE HOPE OF GAINING FAVOUR
WE OUGHT TO MAKE A POINT OF DOING SOMETHING FOR HIM QUICKLY ELSE WE RUN A RISK OF LOSING HIM. MADAME DETAMPES ANSWERED
NO SOONER HAD I REACHED THE PLACE THAN I BEGAN TO VOMIT DURING WHICH THERE CAME FROM MY STOMACH A HAIRY WORM ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CUBIT IN LENGTH
BEING VERY WELL ARMED TO BOOT I WAS NOT AT ALL FRIGHTENED AS TRIBOLO WAS WHO CRIED
GOOD HEAVENS BENVENUTO
THE GOVERNOR REPAIRED AGAIN TO THE POPE WHO TOOK THE BOX ACCORDING TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF TOLD ME AND TURNED IT SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT
A MOST EXCELLENT BUSINESS AND ONE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. HE THEN SENT FOR WINE AND SAID
THIS TIME MADAME DETAMPES HAD THE INSOLENCE TO TELL THE KING
YOUR LUCK HAS BEEN MOST EXCELLENT BUT WHAT HAS BEEN INDEED BAD IS YOUR DEFICIENCY OF KNOWLEDGE
THEN I QUICKENED PACE WHILE THEY STILL FOLLOWED SLOWLY AT MY HEELS
THEN THE DOG SPRANG FORTH AND FLEW AT THEM WITH SUCH FURY TEARING THEIR CAPES AND HOSE THAT IN THEIR FRIGHT THEY FANCIED HE WAS MAD
OF THE MONEY I HAD BROUGHT TO FLORENCE I LEFT THE GREATER PART WITH MY GOOD FATHER PROMISING TO HELP HIM WHEREVER I MIGHT BE AND CONFIDING HIM TO THE CARE OF MY ELDER SISTER
THERE IS NEITHER HOUSE NOR JEWEL HERE
IT IS THUS THAT CELLINI ALWAYS WRITES FONTAINEBLEAU
THE BRUTE REMAINED THERE STUPEFIED AND PALE AS CLAY
THAT WE CANNOT DO. I TOLD THEM
ON THE INSTANT THAT I ENTERED THE CAPTAIN PALLONE DE MEDICI CLAIMED ME AS BEING OF THE PAPAL HOUSEHOLD AND FORCED ME TO ABANDON ALESSANDRO WHICH I HAD TO DO MUCH AGAINST MY WILL
LET US AGREE THEN THAT OUR LUCK IS EQUAL! THEN I DEPARTED IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS AND WENT BACK TO MY WORK
HE HAD BETTER SIT AND LISTEN TO ME
SO THAT THE BARGELLO SAW HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ME EXCEPT IN THE WAY I SAID
ONE STRUCK ME ALSO BUT NOT DIRECTLY ELSE IT WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
AND SO HAVING SPOKEN FOR NEAR UPON AN HOUR THE MARQUIS GREW TIRED OF WAITING AND WENT OFF FUMING
WE MUST THEREFORE TAKE GOOD THOUGHT FOR HIM
LXXXIX I RETURNED TO THE LOGGIA 1 WHITHER MY PERSEUS HAD ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT AND WENT ON PUTTING THE LAST TOUCHES TO MY WORK UNDER THE OLD DIFFICULTIES ALWAYS
AFTER KEEPING WATCH AWHILE THERE MY FRIEND BACHIACCA CREPT UP TO ME
THE SIGHT OF US OUR ARMS AND THE BLOOD INSPIRED THOSE POOR GENTLEMEN WITH SUCH TERROR PARTICULARLY AS THE PLACE WAS KNOWN TO BE A NEST OF MURDERERS THAT THEY ROSE FROM TABLE AND CALLED ON GOD IN A PANIC TO PROTECT THEM
BUT MESSER ANDREA WANTING TO SECURE THE BISHOPRIC DENOUNCED ME TO THE POPE WHO SENT AT ONCE AND HAD ME LODGED IN THE GROUND-FLOOR CHAMBER OF HIS PRIVATE GARDEN
I SAID THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DO SO
TO THESE GENTLEMEN I REPLIED THAT I HAD LEFT FLORENCE ON ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THAT I MEANT TO GO BACK AFTER TWO OR THREE DAYS IN ORDER TO RESUME MY SERVICE WITH THE DUKE
THE SAME DAY HAPPENING TO PASS NEAR THE RIALTO I MET PIERO BENINTENDI IN THE COMPANY OF SOME MEN
CXVIII I BEGAN THE BIBLE FROM THE COMMENCEMENT READING AND REFLECTING ON IT SO DEVOUTLY AND FINDING IN IT SUCH DEEP TREASURES OF DELIGHT THAT IF I HAD BEEN ABLE I SHOULD HAVE DONE NAUGHT ELSE BUT STUDY IT
MEANWHILE I WENT ON MAKING THE DUKES PORTRAIT
MY LADY I THOUGHT THIS NECKLACE OF PEARLS BELONGED ALREADY TO YOUR MOST ILLUS TRIOUS EXCELLENCY
OH WONDERFUL THY POWER
HE HAD HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE POWER OF GOD HIMSELF THAT I ESCAPED UNHURT
AS FOR INSTANCE YOU MIGHT IF THIS WERE VERILY THE CASE. WHEN I HAD SPOKEN SO FAR THE FURIOUS GOVERNOR WOULD NOT LET ME CONCLUDE MY ARGUMENT BUT EXCLAIMED IN A BURST OF RAGE
BERNI STAMPED THE CHARACTER OF HIGH ART UPON THE SPECIES WHICH HAD LONG BEEN IN USE AMONG THE UNLETTERED VULGAR
AND WHEREAS HE HAD NEVER SEEN VENICE AND BECAUSE OF THE GAINS HE EXPECTED HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GO THERE
I COULD HAVE AS MANY AS I ASKED FOR AND EMPLOYED AT TIMES ABOVE FORTY ALL CHOSEN BY MYSELF
BUT IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE BANQUET SHE ROSE AND EXCUSED HERSELF UPON THE PRETEXT OF A NATURAL NEED SAYING SHE WOULD SPEEDILY RETURN
TOLD ME TO STAND IN NO FEAR
BUT IF HIS HEART WAS SET ON HAVING IT ANTONIO LANDI HAD OFFERED ME THE STONE EIGHT DAYS AGO FOR 17,000 CROWNS
CLEMENT VII WAS THE BASTARD SON OF GIULIANO BROTHER OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
HE REPLIED THAT I WAS ALWAYS WANTING TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE BADE ME
IN HER LEFT HAND I PLACED A LITTLE TEMPLE OF IONIC ARCHITECTURE MOST DELICATELY WROUGHT WHICH WAS MEANT TO CONTAIN THE PEPPER
IS IT FINISHED? I DISPLAYED IT
WISHING HOWEVER TO SHOW HIS EXCELLENCY HOW HIGHLY I ESTEEMED HIS COURTESY I SHOULD BE HAPPY IF HE BESTOWED ON ME ONLY ONE OF THOSE RINGS FOR THE CRAMP WHICH COME FROM ENGLAND AND ARE WORTH TENPENCE
2
I HAD ANOTHER FROM FERRARA CALLED BARTOLOMMEO CHIOCCIA
IT IS A TECHNICAL EXPRESSION SIGNIFYING THE BLOCK SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN THE MOULD WHICH BRONZE-FOUNDERS INSERT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A HOLLOW AND NOT A SOLID CAST FROM THE MOULD WHICH GIVES FORM TO THEIR LIQUID METAL
LORD GOD BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE TRUTH LIES OPEN
ADDING THAT I MEANT TO WALK IN PROCESSION AFTER FOUR DAYS AT THE FEAST OF OUR LADY AND MEANT CENCIO TO CARRY A WHITE LIGHTED TORCH ON THE OCCASION
OF THE GREAT EVENTS OF THE TIME THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION AND THE COUNTER-REFORMATION OF THE STRIFE OF POPE AND EMPEROR AND KING WE GET ONLY GLIMPSES
THAT IS THE OPERA DEL DUOMO OR PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT FOR ATTENDING TO THE FABRIC OF THE FLORENTINE CATHEDRAL
AND FOLK IN PARIS CALLED IT POPULARLY BY THE NAME OF LEMMONIO BOREò 2 THE GIRL WHILE SHE SOJOURNED IN THE STATUES HEAD COULD NOT PREVENT SOME OF HER MOVEMENTS TO AND FRO FROM BEING PERCEPTIBLE THROUGH ITS EYE-HOLES
AFTER THAT WE WILL RELEASE YOU. NOTE 1
3 SHE WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED THROUGH HAVING GAINED SOME INKLING OF THE QUACKS PREDICTIONS
YOU SHALL NOT GO
I GAVE MY MIND TO ACQUIRING HIS CRAFT ALSO ALTHOUGH I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT
LET US BIND OUR SWORDS UP FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS FROM CELLINIS BIRTH IN 1500 TO 1562
AS I HAVE ALREADY RELATED IT WAS OVAL IN FORM STANDING ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF A CUBIT WROUGHT OF SOLID GOLD AND WORKED ENTIRELY WITH THE CHISEL
THESE PERSONAGES WERE MADAME DETAMPES THE KINGS MISTRESS
ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL
CXIX DURING THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THERE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS A MARVELLOUS BEING IN THE FORM OF A MOST LOVELY YOUTH WHO CRIED AS THOUGH HE WANTED TO REPROVE ME
SO I RETURNED HOME GLAD AND LIGHT-HEARTED AND COMFORTED MY FAMILY THAT IS TO SAY MY SISTER AND HER SIX DAUGHTERS
BUT THAT HE HAD NEVER MET WITH A MAN OF SOUL SO FIRM AS MINE AND THAT I OUGHT TO FOLLOW HIS COUNSEL
THEREFORE THE LATTER COULD INDULGE THE POPE BEYOND HIS BOLDEST EXPECTATIONS
NO SOONER HAD THE POOR MAN HEARD THE NAME BAT WHICH RECALLED THE HUMOUR HE WAS SUFFERING UNDER THAN HE CRIED OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
THEN HE SAT DOWN TO WRITE AND PRESCRIBED FOR ME PERFUMES LOTIONS UNCTIONS PLASTERS AND A HEAP OF OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS
LECLANCHé INTERPRETS THE WORDS THUS
THE DUKE SIGNED THIS AGREEMENT AS GLADLY AS I TOOK IT SADLY
BUT SIGNOR PIER LUIGI HIS SON AS IT WERE IN THE POPES DESPITE KEPT ME THERE BY FORCE
2 I SENT AT ONCE FOR A CERTAIN MAESTRO GIACOMO OF PERUGIA A MAN OF GREAT SKILL IN SURGERY WHO EXAMINED THE POOR GIRL
FOR THE FURTHER SATISFACTION AND AMAZEMENT OF HIS HOLINESS I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ALL THE OLD COINS WHICH IN FORMER TIMES HAD BEEN MADE BY THOSE ABLE MEN WHO SERVED POPES GIULIO AND LEO
1 A MASTER OF HIS IN THE ART HAD INDEED CONSECRATED SUCH A BOOK QUITE CLOSE TO ROME AT A PLACE CALLED THE BADIA DI FARFA
THE RASCAL WEPT AND WHEEDLED ME WITH A LONG STORY SAYING
ON THURSDAY EVENING MY PROTECTOR TOOK ME TO THE HOUSE OF MESSER BENVEGNATO WHERE ALL THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THAT DISCOMFITURE WERE ASSEMBLED AND ALREADY SEATED AT TABLE
WHEN THE KING APPEARED I MADE MY PRENTICE ASCANIO PUSH THE JUPITER TOWARD HIS MAJESTY
AND SEEING ME MUCH TROUBLED THEY IMPLORED ME TO TELL THEM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
BUT I WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT KNAVERIES OF THIS SORT
GIOVANNI WHO WAS MY FATHER PAID MORE ATTENTION TO IT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER BROTHERS
MESSER BACCIO DEL BENE AND I HAD BEEN INTIMATE FRIENDS IN FORMER TIMES
I HAD FORMED A HABIT OF GOING ON FEAST-DAYS TO THE ANCIENT BUILDINGS AND COPYING PARTS OF THEM IN WAX OR WITH THE PENCIL
THAT EVENING WHEN SHE HEARD THE WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS FROM THE KINGS OWN LIPS IT BRED SUCH POISONOUS FURY IN HER BREAST THAT SHE EXCLAIMED WITH ANGER
IN GODS NAME YOU SPEAK TRUE
HIS MODEST WAYS AND ACTIONS TOGETHER WITH HIS SUPERLATIVE BEAUTY AND HIS DEVOTION TO MYSELF BRED IN ME AS GREAT AN AFFECTION FOR HIM AS A MANS BREAST CAN HOLD
THEY WERE BROUGHT AT ONCE TO THE POPE WHO HEARING THINGS AGAINST ME SAID TO GIACOPO BALDUCCI THE MASTER OF THE MINT TAKE EVERY MEANS IN YOUR POWER TO FIND THE CRIMINAL
3 IN THIS WAY I JOURNEYED TO ROME WITH THE GREATEST ENJOYMENT I HAVE EVER HAD
2 SINCE I KNEW HIM TO HAVE BEEN THE SOLE CAUSE OF MY IMPRISONMENT IN THE CASTLE OF ST ANGELO THE SIGHT OF HIM MADE MY BLOOD BOIL
WE PROCEEDED TO DO AS THEY ADVISED
YOU WILL NOT FIND THERE MISSING A SINGLE ARTICLE OF VALUE WHICH BELONGED TO POPE CLEMENT THAT HAS NOT BEEN MINUTELY NOTED
HE DIED POISONED AT AN EARLY AGE
AND SINCE THEY HAD NOTICED THAT HE DERIVED MUCH PLEASURE FROM MY CONVERSATION THEY WERE ALWAYS FETCHING ME TO KEEP HIM COMPANY
FOR MY PART I PROMISE YOU THAT I SHALL PAY YOU MORE FOR THE STATUE THAN IT IS WORTH. THEN I RETORTED
HE HANDED THE MATTER OVER TO A PAYMASTER DRY AND MEAGRE WHO BORE THE NAME OF LATTANZIO GORINI
LUCIA
THIS MAN WAS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THE MEDICI AND IN 1510 ORGANIZED A CONSPIRACY IN THEIR FAVOUR AGAINST THE GONFALONIER SODERINI
IF YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME YOU NEED NOT STAND IN FEAR OF ANYTHING WHATEVER. I RECOMMENCED
I WENT UP TO THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WHO WAS PRESENT AND BESOUGHT HIM SINCE HE HAD ALREADY CONFERRED UPON ME THE GREAT BENEFIT OF FREEING ME FROM PRISON IN ROME WITH MANY OTHERS BESIDES TO DO ME THIS ONE FAVOUR MORE OF PROCURING FOR ME LEAVE TO TRAVEL INTO ITALY
I AM ONLY AFRAID OF ONE THING AND THAT IS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE
SO IT CHANCED ONE NIGHT
THE BIRD WAS BROODING IN THAT CLEFT AND I HAD OFTEN SEEN A GOLDSMITH NAMED GIOVAN FRANCESCO DELLA TACCA FROM MILAN FIRE AT IT
BY THE BODY OF GOD I WILL TAKE CARE THAT BENVEGNATO TEACHES BENVENUTO HOW TO LIVE. HE AFTERWARDS COMMISSIONED ONE OF THE CAPTAINS WHO WERE WITH HIM BRAVER PERHAPS THAN THE OTHERS BUT WITH LESS APLOMB AS BEING BUT A YOUTH TO SEEK ME OUT
OR WHY AM I OFFERING TO GIVE YOU WHAT I VALUE AT TWO THOUSAND DUCATS
VIII FOR A FULL ACCOUNT OF THIS INCIDENT AT FERRARA
THE ANTIQUES WERE LEFT IN THE BACKGROUND AND MY WORK WAS THE FIRST TO TAKE THE EYE WITH PLEASURE
CIII WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS I COULD NOT HOLD FROM BURSTING INTO A GREAT ROAR OF LAUGHTER
AND MR GUIDO GUIDI THE KINGS PHYSICIAN AND MY MOST INTIMATE FRIEND AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY RELATED HELD HER AT THE FONT
THE INFIRM OLD MAN REPLIED UPON A TONE OF MIGHTY HAUGHTINESS THAT THE SONS OF DUKES WERE WONT TO TRAVEL AS I HAD DESCRIBED AND IN NO OTHER FASHION
FOR EVERY ONE WHO CALLED HIMSELF A MAN AND NOT A MONK WAS BOUND TO KEEP HIS WORD UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE CHANCED TO BE
BUT WHILE I PACED UP AND DOWN DEBATING WHAT TO DO I STUMBLED ON A LONG POLE WHICH WAS COVERED UP WITH STRAW
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD THEN BEEN PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF FILIPPO STROZZI FOR WHICH OFFENCE HE PASSED FIFTEEN YEARS IN A DUNGEON
SINCE THEN I AM PERFORMING A TRUE ACT OF PIETY I LOOK TO THY MAJESTY FOR AID AND COUNSEL. THIS WAS ALL THE RECREATION I ENJOYED UPON MY FORWARD JOURNEY
THEN HE RECOVERED HIS GRAVITY AND TOLD ME IN MY OWN LANGUAGE WHAT THE PAPERS SIGNIFIED ADDING THAT THEY CONFERRED ONE OF THE HIGHEST DIGNITIES A FOREIGNER COULD OBTAIN
BUT AFTERWARDS HE WAS SO STUPID AS NOT TO TELL ME ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
WHEN JUST AS I ROSE TO ACT ON THE DECISION SOME POWER TOOK ME BY THE SHOULDER AND TURNED ME ROUND AND I HEARD A VOICE WHICH CRIED WITH VEHEMENCE
THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE PRESENT TO THE EMPRESS AND THAT FOR THE EMPEROR THEY WOULD AFTERWARDS MAKE WHAT I HAD SUGGESTED WHICH WAS INDEED A PRESENT WORTHY OF HIM
HIS CRIME WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN GREAT IF HE HAD NOT COMMITTED THIS LESSER ONE
BUT NOW HE DID SO MORE THAN HE WAS WONT BEING IN DOUBT HOW THIS DEVILISH AFFAIR WOULD TERMINATE
AND WHEN HE CAME JUST OPPOSITE HE STOPPED AS THOUGH ABOUT TO PICK A QUARREL WITH MYSELF
SO I WOULD NOT HAVE LOST THIS SPECTACLE FOR MUCH
XXXI WHEN ADVERSE FORTUNE OR IF WE PREFER TO CALL IT OUR MALIGNANT PLANET UNDERTAKES TO PERSECUTE A MAN IT NEVER LACKS NEW WAYS OF INJURING HIM
THIS HE SWORE TO DO UPON HIS HONOUR
THEY WERE THOSE WHICH I HAD BEGUN FOR THE CHALICE OF POPE CLEMENT REPRESENTING FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY
I MEANWHILE SET MYSELF TO EMPTYING A STRAW MATTRESS THE STUFFING OF WHICH I BURNED HAVING A CHIMNEY IN MY PRISON
THOUGH THIS PARAGRAPH IS CONFUSED THE MEANING SEEMS TO BE THAT CELLINIS BROTHER-IN-LAW DID NOT USE THE MONEY WHICH ACCRUED FROM THE SALE OF JEWELLERY AND GOT INTO DEBT BECAUSE HIS ALLOWANCE WAS INADEQUATE AND HE WAS OUT OF WORK LIII THE DUKE OF FLORENCE AT THIS TIME WHICH WAS THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1545 HAD RETIRED TO POGGIO A CAJANO TEN MILES DISTANT FROM FLORENCE
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A RICH OUTFIT AND WENT ABOUT WITH THE HIGHEST NOBILITY OF FLORENCE WHO SHOWED A UNANIMOUS DESIRE TO FIGHT FOR THE DEFENCE OF OUR LIBERTIES
HIS WORKS AT FLORENCE ROME AND VENICE ARE JUSTLY FAMOUS
THUS THEN I CONTINUED TO EXIST IN MISERY UPON THAT ROTTEN MATTRESS WHICH IN THREE DAYS SOAKED UP WATER LIKE A SPONGE
WHEN MY ENEMIES PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE QUITE UNABLE TO DEVISE THE MEANS OF KEEPING ME OUT OF THE MINT THEY RESORTED TO ANOTHER EXPEDIENT
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT EVERY EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE PALACE I HAD TO WAIT A LONG WHILE BECAUSE THE DUCHESS OCCUPIED THE CABINETS FOR HER PERSONAL NECESSITIES
THIS MAN HAD NO SKILL IN MY ART
NOW SHOW ME YOUR MODEL BENVENUTO SO THAT I MAY SEE IF YOU HAVE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THOSE FELLOWS. I CAME FORWARD AND OPENED A LITTLE ROUND BOX
UN PAIO DI CESTE A KIND OF LITTER HERE DESCRIBED IN THE PLURAL BECAUSE TWO OF THEM WERE PERHAPS PUT TOGETHER
THEREFORE IT WAS WITH DEEP ILL-HUMOUR THAT I DISCLOSED MY STATUE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
THE MAGNIFICENT SHOW OF WORKS BROUGHT WELL-NIGH TO COMPLETION WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY ANYBODYS EYE
I HAVE DISCHARGED MY DUTY BY SAYING WHAT I HAVE
HOWEVER SINCE I DID NOT WISH TO THROW AWAY THE BEST YEARS OF MY LIFE AND WAS EAGER TO SERVE HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY WHOM I HAD THE SINCEREST DESIRE TO GRATIFY AND OBEY I MADE THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL
WHAT ONE CANNOT IS REQUIRED OF NO ONE
HE WAS ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD FINISH ONE OR TWO OF THEM FOR HIM IN SILVER
TURNING SUDDENLY ROUND AND SEEING HIM LAUGHING I STRUCK HIM SUCH A BLOW ON THE TEMPLE THAT HE FELL DOWN STUNNED LIKE ONE DEAD
HE RECEIVED ME EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE AND SAID
NO SOONER HAD I FINISHED THEM THAN HE SHOWED THEM TO THE POPE
YE SHALL BE HAPPIER AND LIGHTER FAR HEAVEN GIVES THIS HOPE-THAN YE WERE EVER YET
I TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT LAY UPON MY MIND AND WHAT WAS CAUSING ME THIS TROUBLE
THE OTHER WAS THE WIFE OF M
THE OFFICERS CARRIED ME WELL SHUT UP AND COVERED AND FOUR OF THEM WENT IN FRONT MAKING THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WERE STILL ABROAD GET OUT OF THE WAY
THIS WE SEE CLEARLY TO BE THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARS
4 IN HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE A CERTAIN MESSER GIOVANNI A GREEK OF EMINENT LEARNING MESSER LODOVICO OF FANO NO LESS DISTINGUISHED AS A MAN OF LETTERS MESSER ANTONIO ALLEGRETTI AND MESSER ANNIBALE CARO 5 AT THAT TIME IN HIS EARLY MANHOOD
AFTER I HAD SHOWN IT TO MESSER PIETRO HE IMMEDIATELY INTRODUCED ME TO THE POPE
THESE PEARLS EXCEED IN RARITY AND BEAUTY ANY WHICH WERE EVER BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR A NECKLACE. THE DUCHESS HAD RISEN AND WAS STANDING BEHIND A DOOR LISTENING TO ALL I SAID
MADAME SAT BY WITH AN AIR OF SULLEN IRRITATION AND SAINT PAUL STOOD ON HIS DIGNITY DECLINING TO ANSWER THE KINGS QUESTION
I TELL YOU IN PURE TRUTH THAT THEY HAVE DONE ME A GREAT WRONG! THE GOOD-NATURED GENTLEMAN REPEATED TO THE DUKE WHAT I HAD ANSWERED
THEN I RAN TO THE BACK-WINDOW WHICH LOOKED OUT ON GARDENS AND THERE I SAW MORE THAN THIRTY CONSTABLES
I THEN ENTREATED HIM TO SECURE ME FROM IMPRISONMENT AND EVEN FROM A FINE IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
AFTER CASTING A GLANCE AT THE BRONZES WHICH WERE NOT SHOWN TO ADVANTAGE FROM THE LIGHT BEING BELOW THEM HE EXCLAIMED
ON RETURNING HOME HIS MAJESTY AFTER DINNER TOLD THE CARDINAL TO GIVE ORDERS TO HIS TREASURER OF THE EXCHEQUER THAT HE SHOULD PAY ME AT AN EARLY DATE SEVEN THOUSAND CROWNS OF GOLD IN THREE OR FOUR INSTALMENTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CONVENIENCE PROVIDED ONLY THAT HE EXECUTED THE COMMISSION FAITHFULLY
FOR HE HAD WRITTEN ME A LETTER SAYING HE WANTED ME TO STAMP THE COINS OF HIS WHOLE REALM AND ENCLOSING SOME LITTLE DRAWINGS TO EXPLAIN HIS WISHES IN THE MATTER
O MAJORDOMO SO LONG AS YOUR LORDSHIP 2 CHOOSES TO USE LANGUAGE BEFITTING THE HIGH OFFICE WHICH YOU HOLD I SHALL REVERE YOU AND SPEAK TO YOU AS RESPECTFULLY AS I DO TO THE DUKE
WHEN THIS WAS GRANTED HE LIFTED ME ALOFT AMID THE CLAMOUR OF THE COMPANY CRYING
BUT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TERM FOR THEM INASMUCH AS THE ANCIENTS WHO DELIGHTED IN COMPOSING MONSTERS OUT OF GOATS COWS AND HORSES CALLED THESE CHIMERICAL HYBRIDS BY THE NAME OF MONSTERS
WHEN THEY RETURNED HOME MATTIO FRANZESI WAS INFORMED WHO WROTE TO FLORENCE TO MESSER BENEDETTO VARCHI MY VERY DEAR FRIEND THAT THEY HAD SEEN ME DIE AT SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR OF THE NIGHT
FOR THOUGH HE WAS A CLOCKMAKER BY TRADE HE HELD BENEFICES OF SOME VALUE FROM THE POPE
I SHALL TELL THE SENTINELS NOT TO LET YOU PASS AGAIN! THEN TURNING TO THE CASTELLAN I BEGGED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART TO ORDER THE GUARDS TO KEEP ASCANIO OUT ADDING
THERE THE HEEL ITSELF WAS FORMED AND GOING FARTHER I FOUND THE FOOT APPARENTLY COMPLETE
TELL ME WHAT I HAVE COME TO DO HERE. THEN THE JUDGE TURNED TO CATERINA AND SAID
HE HAD THE AIR OF A GENTLE YOUNG LADY BUT AT NEED HE COULD PROVE HIMSELF ONE OF THE BOLDEST AND BLOODIEST FIGHTERS IN THE WORLD
AND LATE THE NEXT DAY THERE CAME THE NEWS TO ROME OF DUKE ALESSANDROS DEATH
BUT IT USED ALSO TO BE CONFERRED ON LAYMEN AMONG WHOM WERE BREMANTE AND SEBASTIANO DEL PIOMBO
FOR NO ONE CAN DIVINE WHAT NATURE IS ABLE TO WORK IN A YOUNG MAN OF THIS KIND
BUT A MOST REMARKABLE INCIDENT WHICH I DO NOT LIKE TO OMIT OBLIGES ME TO DO SO
VARCHI WAS REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THE NEWS OF CELLINIS DEATH
EVEN SO WITHOUT GOLD THIS PIECE OF MINE CANNOT BE FINISHED. THE MASTER OF THE WARDROBE HAVING AN INKLING THAT I HAD MADE A FOOL OF HIM TOLD ME HE SHOULD REPORT ALL I HAD SPOKEN TO HIS HOLINESS
AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
WHEN THIS BEGAN TO BORE ME I ASKED IF HE COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT A CERTAIN SICILIAN WOMAN CALLED BEATRICE WHO HAD A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER NAMED ANGELICA AND BOTH WERE COURTESANS
ALL THE TREES WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR LEAVES AND SHATTERED
ALL THE WHILE I WAS AT FLORENCE I STUDIED THE NOBLE MANNER OF MICHEL AGNOLO AND FROM THIS I HAVE NEVER DEVIATED
WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
SO WE TOOK OUR WAY TOWARD THE PALACE
NOW THE POPE USED TO COME AT TIMES TO SUP THERE AND ON THOSE OCCASIONS NO WATCH WAS KEPT BUT THE PLACE STOOD OPEN LIKE AN ORDINARY PALACE
THEN HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS
THESE ARTISTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PASQUALINO ARE ALL KNOWN TO US IN THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED BY CELLINI
GAMBETTA YIELDING TO THE INSTINCT OF HER TRADE WENT OUT ACTING UNDER THE ORDERS OF THAT MAD KNAVISH PEDANT THE MAJORDOMO--I MUST ADD THAT THEY HAD ALSO GAINED OVER THE BARGELLO A BOLOGNESE WHOM THE DUKE AFTERWARDS DISMISSED FOR SIMILAR CONSPIRACIES
CXIV TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS THE CARDINAL CORNARO WENT TO BEG A BISHOPRIC FROM THE POPE FOR A GENTLEMAN OF HIS CALLED MESSER ANDREA CENTANO
TELL HIM I WILL HAVE THE MARBLE BY ALL MEANS
THE POPE WAS A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY SENSE AND ABILITY BUT IN THIS AFFAIR OF MINE HE BEHAVED WEAKLY AND UNINTELLIGENTLY
HE CRIED ALOUD
CREDO ID SING SALVE REGINAS POUR AND PATERNOSTERS
YOU HAVE ALREADY GIVEN HIM ONE GREAT TASK AND NOW BY ADDING A GREATER YOU ARE LIKE TO MAKE THEM CLASH TOGETHER. THE POPE IN A RAGE TURNED ROUND ON HIM AND TOLD HIM TO MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS
SEE VITA PAULI III IN CONTINUATION OF PLATINA
IN THE FIRST DAYS OF YOUR PAPACY IT WERE NOT WELL TO GRANT-PARDONS OF THIS KIND. THE POPE TURNED TO HIM AND ANSWERED
HE WAS HOWEVER AN EXCELLENT MASTER OF DESIGN AND HAD COLLECTED ROUND HIM A TROOP OF WORK-PEOPLE FORMED IN THE SCHOOL OF ROSSO OUR FLORENTINE PAINTER WHO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY AN ARTIST OF EXTRAORDINARY MERIT
HE ADVISED ME TO DO SO WITHOUT HESITATION SAYING THAT THE WORST RISK I RAN WAS THAT I MIGHT LOSE MY SWORD
THROWN TOGETHER BY ACCIDENT WE PERFORMED THE JOURNEY WITH MUCH ENJOYMENT ON BOTH SIDES
TO THIS I REPLIED THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF WRONGING THE LATTER IN ANY WAY AND AS I HAD COMPLETED HIS COMMISSIONS I CHOSE TO BE MY OWN MASTER AND NOT THE MAN OF OTHERS AND THAT HE WHO WANTED ME MUST BEG ME OF MYSELF
THIS GENTLEMAN CAME TO ME ONE DAY AND SHOWED ME A LITTLE GOLD RING WHICH HAD BEEN DISCOLOURED BY QUICKSILVER SAYING AT THE SAME TIME
THIS WAS A SEATED CHRIST SUPPORTING HIS GREAT CROSS ALOFT WITH THE LEFT HAND WHILE HE SEEMED TO LEAN AGAINST IT AND WITH THE FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT HAND HE APPEARED TO BE OPENING THE WOUND IN HIS SIDE
MARIA NOVELLA AT FLORENCE AND IN THE CHURCH OF S
THE DUKE GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE PAID A HUNDRED GOLDEN CROWNS IN GOLD PER MONTH UNTIL THE SUM WAS DISCHARGED
AFTERWARDS I TURNED TO THE OTHER JEWELLERS AND SAID
WHEN WE APPEARED BEFORE THE JUDGES FOR CRIMINAL AFFAIRS I FOUND CATERINA AND HER MOTHER WAITING
NOR SHOULD MY MISERY BEAR SO GRIM A GUISE. CXXIV ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN THE SERVANT OF THE CASTELLAN WHO WAS MY FRIEND BROUGHT ME MY FOOD I GAVE HIM THIS SONNET COPIED OUT IN WRITING
HE WAS HIGHLY DELIGHTED WITH THIS PIECE AND CONCEIVED SUCH A LIKING FOR ME THAT HE EARNESTLY BEGGED ME TO TAKE UP MY WORKING QUARTERS IN THE PALACE SELECTING ROOMS LARGE ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE AND FITTING THEM UP WITH FURNACES AND ALL I WANTED FOR HE GREATLY ENJOYED WATCHING THE PROCESSES OF ART
3 THERE WAS ALSO A BALANCE DUE UPON MY SALARY WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE FORGOTTEN SINCE THREE YEARS HAD ELAPSED WITHOUT PAYMENT
FOR PEARLS ARE NOT GEMS
NO PAPER PENS INK FIRE OR TOOLS OF STEEL TO EXERCISE THE QUICK BRAINS TEEMING THOUGHT
DONT YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MOST CERTAIN? GIORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
NAY LOOK WELL TO YOUR SAFETY
HE SENT FOR GIANGIACOMO AND ASKED HIM WHERE AND HOW HE HAD PROCURED SO EXCELLENT A CORNET FOR SOPRANO AND INQUIRED PARTICULARLY WHO I WAS

THE SUBSTANCE OF IT WAS THAT THE POPE REQUIRED ME TO COME AT ONCE WANTING TO EMPLOY ME ON WORK OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE
THEY ATTENDED ME MORE THAN SIX FULL MONTHS AND I REMAINED MORE THAN A WHOLE YEAR BEFORE I COULD ENJOY MY LIFE AND VIGOUR
SO I GOT AN ADMIRABLE LITTLE GUN READY WHICH I USED FOR SHOOTING GAME AND MUTTERED TO MYSELF
I DO NOT GIVE THAT WOMAN THE LEAST THOUGHT
I DO NOT LIKE TO LET THOSE EXQUISITE FIGURES BE WASTED ON THE PEDESTAL DOWN THERE IN THE PIAZZA WHERE THEY WILL RUN THE RISK OF BEING INJURED
AH

I SHOWED HIM PART OF THE MODEL FOR THE CLASP WHICH I HAD MADE IN FLORENCE AT SALIMBENES
HE LED ME ONWARD AND WENT FORTH IN FRONT OF ME THROUGH A LITTLE LOW DOOR INTO A PLACE WHICH LOOKED LIKE A NARROW STREET
THE TREASURER WAITED TILL I TOOK MY LEAVE OF THE CARDINAL
THIS ENTAILED SOME DIFFICULTIES TO RELATE WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ART
1 I MAY SAY THAT IT IS USUAL EVERY YEAR ON THIS SOLEMN FESTIVAL TO GRANT THE FREEDOM OF TWELVE OUTLAWS TO THESE OFFICERS
HE TOOK SO MUCH PLEASURE IN THESE TRIFLES THAT HE MADE ME WORK BY DAY ALSO AND IF I DELAYED COMING HE USED TO SEND FOR ME
THEN I STAMPED A COIN IN GOLD AND ONE SUNDAY AFTER DINNER TOOK THE COIN AND THE DIES TO THE POPE WHO WHEN HE SAW THE PIECE WAS ASTONISHED AND GREATLY GRATIFIED NOT ONLY BECAUSE MY WORK PLEASED HIM EXCESSIVELY BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH I HAD PERFORMED IT
AND HAVING NEVER BEEN IN MANTUA I WENT THERE VERY WILLINGLY
HIS REPUTE WAS GREAT IN HIS DAY AND PERHAPS GOOD IN THE SENSE IN WHICH HE MEANT GOODNESS
THE LATTER ENJOYED AN EXCELLENT APPOINTMENT UNDER THE SIGNORIA OF VENICE
BUT FIRST HE WISHED IT RICHLY SET IN GOLD AND ORDERED US TO MAKE SKETCHES FOR THIS PURPOSE
I GAVE THOSE OTHER MEN NO SALARY
1 I HAD RETIRED TO SOME DISTANCE IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT EXCHANGE OPINIONS FREELY
I URGED IN REPLY THAT HIS MAJESTY HAD SENT FOR ME FROM ITALY IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT EXECUTE GOOD WORK
SPYING FROM WITHIN TWO TILES UPON THE ROOF I WAS ABLE AT ONCE TO CLAMBER UP WITH EASE
AND THE FELLOW WANTING TO SECURE FOR HIMSELF ALONE THE HONOUR OF PALMING IT OFF UPON THE DUKE OF FLORENCE ABSTAINED FROM TAKING HIS PARTNER ANTONIO LANDI INTO THE SECRET
CIX IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY ARRIVAL THERE CAME TO VISIT ME A CERTAIN RAFFAELLONE SCHEGGIA WHOSE TRADE WAS THAT OF A CLOTH-OF-GOLD WEAVER
THE FRIENDS WHO WERE WITH HIM REMAINING ON THE BORDER OF THE BROKEN VAULT TOOK NO HARM BUT WERE ASTOUNDED AND FULL OF WONDER ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE PROPHECY WHICH HE HAD JUST CONTEMPTUOUSLY REPEATED TO THEM
I THEN REFLECTING THAT THE POPES ANGER AGAINST ME MUST SUBSIDE AS WELL BECAUSE OF MY INNOCENCE AS BECAUSE OF THE FAVOUR SHOWN ME BY THE KING KEPT MY SHOP IN ROME OPEN WHILE ASCANIO MY PRENTICE CAME TO THE CASTLE AND BROUGHT ME THINGS TO WORK AT
HOWEVER THE CASTELLAN HUSHED THE AFFAIR UP ALTHOUGH IT HAD REACHED THE POPES EARS
ON IT I MODELLED PEACE GIVING HER THE FORM OF A WOMAN WITH A TORCH IN HER HAND SETTING FIRE TO A TROPHY OF ARMS
BUT CRESPINO REBUKED THEM
120 FOR THE RIGHT MEANING OF WARDROBE
HE WAS A NOTARY BORN IN FLORENCE SON OF A BLIND MAN WHO SAID PRAYERS ABOUT THE STREETS FOR ALMS AND A SIENESE BY RACE
WHILE I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THIS WONDROUS THING I NOTICED THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE SPHERE BEGAN TO SWELL AND THE SWOLLEN SURFACE GREW AND SUDDENLY A CHRIST UPON THE CROSS FORMED ITSELF OUT OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE AS THE SUN
I STAYED IN THAT PLACE ABOUT A MONTH WITH MUCH CONTENT AND GLADNESS ENJOYING GOOD WINES AND EXCELLENT FOOD AND TREATED WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS BY THE COUNT
WE ARE VERY GLAD TO HAVE ACTED IN THE PLACE OF YOUR AGENTS
AT THIS HE SHOWED DISPLEASURE
WHEREOF I SHALL SPEAK HEREAFTER IN THE PROPER PLACE
FOR IF I HAD RETURNED TO FRANCE THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME MERE WORKMEN UNDER ME ONCE MORE WHEREAS WHILE I REMAINED AWAY THEY WERE THEIR OWN MASTERS AND IN MY PLACE
8 I WORKED HARD THE WHOLE OF THAT DAY
THE RESULT WAS THAT LUIGI RECOGNISING THE GREAT BENEFITS HE HAD RECEIVED FROM ME OFTENTIMES WITH WORDS AND TEARS RETURNED ME THANKS PROTESTING THAT IF GOD SHOULD EVER PUT GOOD FORTUNE IN HIS WAY HE WOULD RECOMPENSE ME FOR MY KINDNESS

I MUST TELL YOU THAT A GENTLEMAN OF GREAT QUALITY AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHO WENT TO ROME UPON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HAD THIS ANTIQUE VASE SHOWN TO HIM IN SECRET
EVERYTHING WHICH PASSED BY WORD OR ACT WAS DULY REPORTED TO HIS MAJESTY
THE ROTONDA IS ENTIRE WHICH WAS MADE FOR THE TEMPLE OF MARS AND IS NOW DEDICATED TO OUR SAINT JOHN
LET US GO FORWARD FOR GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HAVE THE RIGHT ON THEIR SIDE
A SUA PROVISIONE STAVA I
HIS SON COSIMO AFTER THE MURDER OF DUKE ALESSANDRO ESTABLISHED THE SECOND MEDICEAN DYNASTY IN FLORENCE
AND GHERARDO WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE QUARREL FLUNG HIMSELF UPON ME
THESE WERE EXECUTED AND IN PART ENAMELLED WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE REFINEMENT
THEY AUGMENT THE GLORY OF YOUR EXCELLENCY BY THEIR GENIUS
WHEN I PERCEIVED THIS I LEFT THEIR COMPANY AND HELD THEM FOR THIEVES AND BLACK-GUARDS
I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO MEET HONEST MEN AND THOSE WHO SHOW THEMSELVES AS SUCH. WHEN WE PARTED I WENT TO HIS LORDSHIPS PALACE AND FOUND HE HAD NOT SENT FOR ME
CHE METTESSI TANTA MAZZA LIX IT WAS TRUE INDEED THAT I HAD GOT THE SICKNESS
THEN PUBLICLY BEFORE THEM ALL I SAID HOW SOME WICKED SCOUNDREL HAD TOLD MY LORD THE DUKE THAT I HAD BRAGGED I MEANT TO BE THE FIRST TO SCALE HIS EXCELLENCYS WALLS AND ALSO THAT I HAD ABUSED HIM PERSONALLY
WHEN HE PERCEIVED I WAS NOT GOING TO BRING IT HE BEGAN TO DISPLAY REAL DISPLEASURE AND PROTESTED HE WOULD PUNISH ME IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
BUT THIS THOUGH ONLY IN THE ROUGH DISPLAYED A GRANDER STYLE THAN THAT OF THE WAXEN MODEL
GICHERO ARUM MACULATUM AND CLIZIA THE SUNFLOWER
NOW THIS MAN HAD A HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN TO WIFE WHO SAID TO HIM
THERE WERE TWO ARTISTS AT THIS EPOCH SURNAMED BACHIACCA THE TWIN SONS OF UBERTINO VERDI CALLED RESPECTIVELY FRANCESCO AND ANTONIO
MESSER DURANTE OF BRESCIA WHOM I HAVE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ENGAGED THE SOLDIER FORMERLY DRUGGIST OF PRATO TO ADMINISTER SOME DEADLY LIQUOR IN MY FOOD
BUT I MADE THEM OF REFINED STEEL
NOW YOU OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE MORE SUBMISSIVE NOT SO ARROGANT AND HEADSTRONG
HOWEVER NOTHWITHSTANDING GREAT DISCOMFORTS AND DAILY ANNOYANCES I PERSEVERED IN GOING
BEFORE DESPATCHING IT I TOOK IT TO THE DUKE WHO READ IT WITH INTEREST
YET NEITHER YOU NOR ANYBODY ELSE CAME FORWARD TO SPEAK A WORD ABOUT IT
AND THESE TOGETHER WITH THE COSTS OF TRAVELLING AMOUNTED TO ABOUT SEVENTY CROWNS
THE WIFE OF PIER LUIGI FARNESE WAS JERONIMA DAUGHTER OF LUIGI ORSINI COUNT OF PITIGLIANO
THE MAN INTOLERANT OF MY REBUKE RUSHED TO THE CASTELLANS ROOM AND BROUGHT ME THE WAX WITH THE MODEL OF THE KEYS
BUT BEING A MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT THE POPE HAD MADE HIM VERY RICH AND CONFIDED IN HIM LIKE HIMSELF
THESE THREE MEN BEGAN AT FIRST TO QUESTION ME IN GENTLE TERMS WHICH AFTERWARDS THEY CHANGED TO WORDS OF CONSIDERABLE HARSHNESS AND MENACE APPARENTLY BECAUSE I SAID TO THEM
IT FILLED THE MOULD OF THE JUPITER MOST ADMIRABLY AND AT THE SAME TIME MY TWO HEADS
THIS WAS NOT THE CASE WHEN I ADDRESSED HIS HOLINESS IN WHOM I BEHELD A FAR SUPERIOR DEITY BOTH BY REASON OF HIS ECCLESIASTICAL ADORNMENTS WHICH SHED A CERTAIN AUREOLE ABOUT HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE OF HIS HOLINESS DIGNITY OF VENERABLE AGE
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
YOU ARE LAUGHING AT THEM ARE YOU
ASCANIO WHO WAS PRESENT AT THIS DEBATE SAID HALF IN TEARS
SHE HAD A RICHLY DECORATED TEMPLE FIRMLY BASED UPON THE GROUND AT ONE SIDE
IN LIKE MANNER POOR OLD LIONARDO TEDALDI WHO LIKE ME WAS KNEELING ON THE GROUND RECEIVED SO SHREWD A BLOW THAT HE FELL GROVELLING UPON ALL FOURS
ONE OF THE FRAGMENTS STRUCK HIM IN THE FACE
THE GREAT KING FRANCIS WAS MOST FRANK AND LIBERAL IN ALL HIS DEALINGS AND THE CARDINAL WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS TEMPER
AND WHEN HE DREW ME AFTER HIM INTO THE STREET AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE HALL BEHOLD I WAS DISARMED AND CLOTHED IN A WHITE SHIRT WITH NOTHING ON MY HEAD AND I WAS WALKING ON THE RIGHT HAND OF MY COMPANION
CXXVI AT THIS TIME THE BISHOP OF PAVIA BROTHER OF THE COUNT OF SAN SECONDO AND COMMONLY CALLED MONSIGNOR DE ROSSI OF PARMA HAPPENED TO BE IMPRISONED IN THE CASTLE FOR SOME TROUBLESOME AFFAIRS AT PAVIA
WHEN I NOTICED THE DISMAY OF HER FATHER I BEGGED HIM NOT TO BELIEVE ALL THAT THIS IGNORANT DOCTOR HAD SAID
THE JUDGE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
MESSER DURANTE MY ENEMY OR WHOEVER IT WAS GAVE A DIAMOND TO LIONE TO POUND FOR ME OF THE WORTH OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED CROWNS
I WAS TO FINISH THE ONE HE LIKED WITH CARE
THE CHURCH HAVING A STRONG CLAIM TO THEM THE DUKE WAS FORCED TO PURCHASE PEACE BY PAYING DOWN AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY
GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT. I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
CELLINI CALLS THESE MAGISTRATES ARRONZINATI CAPPUCCETTI A TERM CORRESPONDING TO OUR ROUNDHEADS
BUT IN THIS CASE IF YOU LOVE ME DO NOT ATTEND TO ME BUT LOOK TO YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND GO AT ONCE LIKE OUR OTHER FRIENDS FOR NOW THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE. THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN IN ONE BREATH
SO WE UNPACKED OUR THINGS AND WHEN THE CARDINAL HEARD THIS HE TOLD THE KING WHO EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEE ME AT ONCE
POVERTY INDUCED HIM TO KEEP THIS FOR HIMSELF AND TO POUND FOR ME A GREENISH BERYL OF THE VALUE OF TWO CARLINS THINKING PERHAPS BECAUSE IT ALSO WAS A STONE THAT IT WOULD WORK THE SAME EFFECT AS THE DIAMOND
I HAD NOW CONCILIATED THE AFFECTION OF HIS EXCELLENCY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT EVERY EVENING WHEN I CAME TO HIM HE TREATED ME WITH GREATER KINDNESS
WHILE ENGAGED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THE MAN BEGGED HIS MAJESTY TO GIVE HIM A TENNIS-COURT I HAD IN MY CASTLE TOGETHER WITH SOME LITTLE APARTMENTS WHICH HE SAID I DID NOT USE
AT THE SAME TIME HE REPEATED WORDS TO THIS EFFECT
MY DEAR LORD FOR HEAVENS SAKE BUY THIS NECKLACE FOR THE POOR DUCHESS WHO IS DYING TO HAVE IT AND CANNOT INDEED LIVE WITHOUT IT. THE FELLOW POURED FORTH SO MUCH OF THIS STUPID NONSENSICAL STUFF THAT THE DUKES PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED AND HE CRIED
FOR OUR REPUTATION AND YOUR OWN REFRAIN THESE FOUR OR FIVE DAYS FROM GOING ABOUT IN THE BANCHI
I GOT YOU PROMOTED AND YOU HAVE GOT ME CASHIERED
WHEN I REACHED BOLOGNA I PUT MYSELF UNDER A CERTAIN MAESTRO ERCOLE DEL PIFFERO AND BEGAN TO EARN SOMETHING BY MY TRADE
HE READILY COMPLIED AND PUT THEM ON AT ONCE WHILE I ADDED NEW BEAUTIES TO THE BEAUTY OF HIS FACE BY THE ELABORATE AND STUDIED WAY IN WHICH I DRESSED HIS HAIR
THEN HE SAID THAT THE DIAMOND PLEASED HIM WELL BUT THAT HE SHOULD BE MUCH BETTER PLEASED IF I WERE TO STAY WITH HIM
UN NOSTRO PARENTE HE SAYS ABOVE THAT HE WROTE THE CAPITOLO ON THE LEAVES OF HIS BIBLE
UN NOSTRO PARENTE HE SAYS ABOVE THAT HE WROTE THE CAPITOLO ON THE LEAVES OF HIS BIBLE
AND THESE THINGS WHO SPEAKETH TRUE IN HEAVEN ON EARTH TO ME MADE WONDROUS PLAIN
AFTER MANY AND MANY MERRY MEETINGS IT SEEMED GOOD TO OUR WORTHY PRESIDENT THAT FOR THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WE SHOULD REPAIR TO SUPPER IN HIS HOUSE AND THAT EACH ONE OF US SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO BRING WITH HIM HIS CROW SUCH WAS THE NICKNAME MICHEL AGNOLO GAVE TO WOMEN IN THE CLUB AND THAT WHOSO DID NOT BRING ONE SHOULD BE SCONCED BY PAYING A SUPPER TO THE WHOLE COMPANY
I QUITE LOST MY SIGHT AND AFTER YOUR HOLINESS DEPARTURE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO WORK AT ALL. RISING FROM MY KNEES I LEFT THE PRESENCE WITHOUT FURTHER LICENSE
IN THE QUARTER PRESIDED OVER BY THE DEITY OF OCEAN I FASHIONED SUCH CHOICE KINDS OF FISHES AND SHELLS AS COULD BE PROPERLY DISPLAYED IN THAT SMALL SPACE
WHAT CELLINI MEANS IS THAT SBIETTA WAS TO WORK THE FARM PAYING CELLINI ITS ANNUAL VALUE
I LOST THE GOOD GRACES OF THE DUCHESS ONCE AND FOR EVER AND THEREBY WENT CLOSE TO HAVING THE DUKES PROTECTION TAKEN FROM ME
FELICE HAD GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
SFORZA GO AND SEEK OUT BENVENUTO
YOUR PIECE AND ALL THE STONES ARE HERE
SARGE
AND THEY BEGAN TO UPBRAID AND CRY OUT UPON ME-PARTLY I THINK BECAUSE THEY SAW ME IN MY CLOAK WHILE THE OTHERS WERE DRESSED LIKE CITIZENS IN MANTLE AND HOOD
BUT HAVING DONE SO SINCE THE WILL OF HEAVEN MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED IT PLEASED GOD TO REMIND ME OF MY POOR SISTER WHO HAD SUFFERED GREATLY FROM THE NEWS OF MY MISFORTUNES
AFTERWARDS I SOUGHT AUDIENCE OF THE KING THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS TREASURER MESSER GIULIANO BUONACCORTI
AND HIS MESSENGER ALWAYS SPOKE TO THIS EFFECT
I WENT ON FIRING UNDER THE EYES OF SEVERAL CARDINALS AND LORDS WHO KEPT BLESSING ME AND GIVING ME THE HEARTIEST ENCOURAGEMENT
THE POPE ANSWERED THAT SUCH WAS THE CUSTOM AND THAT I MUST FOLLOW IT
CONSEQUENTLY MESSER PIER CARNESECCHI WHO WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE POPES UNDERTOOK TO KEEP ME IN SIGHT AND LET ME ADROITLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THE POPE DESIRED MY SERVICES
WHEREUPON I GOT ANGRY AND CRIED OUT
IT IS TRUE THAT THIS POOR FELLOW BENVENUTO HAS SUFFERED A MOST GRIEVOUS WRONG
THE LATTER TOOK THEM AND THEN HANDED THEM TO MESSER SFORZA REMARKING
3 HE REFUSED TO COME WHICH MADE ME SO ANGRY THAT FUMING WITH FURY AND SWELLING LIKE AN ASP I TOOK A DESPERATE RESOLVE
I TOOK NOTHING MOST BLESSED FATHER BUT WHAT I HAVE CONFESSED
SO WE ARRIVED AT SURICH A MARVELLOUS CITY BRIGHT AND POLISHED LIKE A LITTLE GEM
AND WHEN UPON THE NEXT DAY I FOUND MYSELF OUTSIDE THE FERRARESE DOMAIN I FELT EXCESSIVELY RELIEVED
MAESTRO GIOVANNI DO WHAT THE GONFALONIER TELLS YOU
ON SEEING MY ANXIETY TO RETURN HOME THE CARDINAL GAVE ME MONEY SUFFICIENT FOR MAKING HIM A SILVER BASON AND JUG
OH POWER OF NATURE
BENEDETTO DA MONTE VARCHI WAS THE CELEBRATED POET SCHOLAR AND HISTORIAN OF FLORENCE BETTER KNOWN AS VARCHI
HE WAS A GENERAL OF CONSIDERABLE REPUTE IN THE SPANISH FRENCH AND FLORENTINE SERVICES SUCCESSIVELY
HOW THEN
AWAY WITH YOU OLD TRAITOR
UPON THIS HE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND THE COLOUR COMING BACK INTO HIS FACE HE SAID TO ME WITH THE MOST PLEASANT MANNER
BUT I NOTICED THAT IT DID NOT FLOW AS RAPIDLY AS USUAL THE REASON BEING PROBABLY THAT THE FIERCE HEAT OF THE FIRE WE KINDLED HAD CONSUMED ITS BASE ALLOY
THOMAS ON THE FRONT OF ORSAMMICHELE
FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
HIS GENIUS NEVER AFTERWARDS ATTAINED TO THE FORCE OF THOSE FIRST STUDIES
I INSTALLED MYSELF ENROLLED SERVING-MEN AND BOUGHT A QUANTITY OF PIKES AND PARTISANS
MAKE THEN YOUR MIND UP IF YOU WANT BENVENUTO ALSO TO STAY HERE WITH ME FOR I DO NOT MEAN ELSEWISE TO LET YOU HAVE HIM. ACCORDINGLY I SPENT A VERY PLEASANT VISIT AT THE HOUSE OF THAT MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN
VASARI INTRODUCED HIM TOGETHER WITH COSIMOS OTHER FAVOURED ARTISTS IN A FRESCO OF THE PALAZZO VECCHIO AT FLORENCE
AND THEN I HAD SOME QUANTITIES OF GRAIN AND OTHER PRODUCE HANDED OVER
WHO TOLD ME THAT IF I WAS ALONE I NEED ONLY KEEP QUIET AND HAVE NO FURTHER ANXIETY BUT TO GO ON WORKING AT THE JEWEL WHICH THE POPE HAD SET HIS HEART ON AND STAY EIGHT DAYS INDOORS
AT THE SAME TIME I CRIED
THE POPE WAS IN THE BELVEDERE
IN RAVENNA WHICH IS A MOST ANCIENT CITY THERE EXIST CELLINI OF OUR NAME IN THE QUALITY OF VERY HONOURABLE GENTRY WHO BEAR A LION RAMPANT OR UPON A FIELD OF AZURE HOLDING A LILY GULES IN HIS DEXTER PAW WITH A LABEL IN CHIEF AND THREE LITTLE LILIES OR
THE DUKE TOOK SO MUCH PLEASURE IN MY WORK AND CONVERSATION THAT HE NOT UNFREQUENTLY POSED THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AT A STRETCH FOR HIS OWN PORTRAIT AND SOMETIMES INVITED ME TO SUPPER
OTTAVIANO IS TOO PRESUMING
TO THIS THE CARDINAL ADDED
AND WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD DISCOVERED HOW TO GET OUT OF IT I PONDERED THE MEANS OF DESCENDING FROM THE LOFTY KEEP FOR SO THE GREAT ROUND CENTRAL TOWER IS CALLED
THE KING BEGAN BY ASKING ME WHAT I MEANT TO REPRESENT BY THE FINE FANCY I HAD EMBODIED IN THIS DESIGN SAYING THAT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE DOOR WITHOUT EXPLANATION BUT THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE THE CONCEPTION OF MY FOUNTAIN ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED TO HIM MOST BEAUTIFUL
ANGELO IN SAFETY TO PERUGIA
CELLINI SHOWS HIS MEDICEAN SYMPATHIES BY USING THIS CONTEMPTUOUS TERM AND BY THE HONOURABLE MENTION HE MAKES OF PRINZIVALLE DELLA STUFA NOTE 2
SO I BORE THE EXTREME DISCOMFORTS OF MY SITUATION AND HAD FOR COMPANION OF MISERY A FRIAR OF THE PALAVISINA HOUSE WHO WAS A VERY FAMOUS PREACHER
ANGEL BEAUTEOUS ANGEL BEST SAVE ME THOU MAKE THOU ME BLEST. UPON THIS MY CHARMING CREATURE LAUGHED AND LIFTED THE RIGHT HAND AND GAVE HIM A PAPAL BENEDICTION WITH MANY PLEASANT WORDS TO BOOT
AND THESE WORDS HE SEEMED TO SAY IN ANGER DRIPPING WET AND SPLUTTERING THE WHILE
AND WE WERE TOLD THAT IF THE WOUND WAS KEPT CONTINUALLY PLUGGED WITH ITS LEAVES THE BEAST WOULD NOT ONLY RECOVER BUT WOULD SERVE US JUST AS IF IT HAD SUSTAINED NO INJURY
WHEN HE SAW THAT I REFUSED TO REPLY HE HAD AT LEAST THE CLEVERNESS TO PUT IN
I HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO FETCH MY BREATH BACK IF IT LEFT ME
AND I FOUND THAT ALL THE BRONZE MY FURNACE CONTAINED HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED IN THE HEAD OF THIS FIGURE
CONSEQUENTLY I DECLINED POSITIVELY TO EXECUTE THEM
IT WAS MEANT FOR THE LITTLE FINGER
THE POPE MOREOVER COMMISSIONED HIM TO BEGIN THE CHALICE UPON THE MODEL HE HAD SEEN IN MINE
THE SIGHT OF THEM STIRRED IN ME A GREAT DESIRE TO TRY MY OWN SKILL IN THAT BRANCH SO DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS WHICH I PRACTICED
HE ALSO MADE SOME EXCELLENT BRONZEWORK FOR THE MEDICEAN VILLAS AT CESTELLO AND PETRAJA
THE CARDINAL REMEMBERING MY WORDS AND NETTLED BY THE REVENGE HE THOUGHT THAT I WAS TAKING ON HIM REMARKED TO THE KING
THEREFORE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SETTLE THE MODEL BUT SHALL GO ON DOING THE BEST I CAN. HIS EXCELLENCY SENT TO ROME POST-HASTE FOR A BLOCK OF GREEK MARBLE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT RESTORE HIS ANTIQUE GANYMEDE WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THAT DISPUTE WITH BANDINELLO
THIS FIGURE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE NYMPH OF FONTAINEBLEAU
AND HE LOVED HIM ALL THE MORE FOR HAVING DRAWN HIM FROM A VERY HUMBLE PLACE AND FOR THE REASON THAT SO EXCELLENT A MAN WAS A CREATURE OF HIS OWN
THIS WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO A FEARFUL PLACE WHICH HAD SWALLOWED MANY MEN ALIVE
THE MAN NOTED DOWN MY ACT AND WORDS AND REPORTED THEM TO THE DUKE WHO WAS HIGHLY INCENSED AND SHOWED A STRONG INCLINATION TO MAKE ME RETRACE MY STEPS
IT WOULD BE LESS TROUBLE TO RUN YOU THROUGH THE BODY THAN TO BUILD THE BASTION OF THIS GATE. IN AN INSTANT WE BOTH SET HANDS TO OUR SWORDS WITHOUT QUITE DRAWING
1 THEY RELATE THAT I RAN IN HIGH JOY TO MY GRANDFATHER CRYING OUT
I AM BRINGING YOU A FINE PRESENT SUCH AS YOU DID NOT ANTICIPATE. MY FATHER WHO WAS A TRUE PHILOSOPHER WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN AND ANSWERED
FOR THERE LAY ALL THINGS NEEDFUL TO MY VENTURE
I CARE FOR NOTHING IN THE WORLD. THE WRETCHED MAN BEGAN SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
I RETORTED THAT THE SONS OF MY ART TRAVELLED IN THE WAY I HAD INFORMED HIM AND THAT NOT BEING A DUKES SON I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF SUCH FOLK
ARRANGE MY LORD THAT EVERY ONE WHO LIKES SHALL MAKE A MODEL
XXIV KNOWING NOW THAT I HAD GRATIFIED MY FATHERS HONEST WISH I BEGAN TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING WOULD PROSPER WITH ME TO A GLORIOUS AND HONOURABLE END
HE PASSED THE BERNINA AND ALBULA MOUNTAINS DESCENDED THE VALLEY OF THE RHINE TO WALLENSTADT TRAVELLED BY WEESEN AND PROBABLY GLARUS TO LACHEN AND ZURICH THENCE TO SOLOTHURN LAUSANNE GENEVA LYONS
OH HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU UGLY&HELLIP; 1 AT THESE WORDS THE DUKE FROWNED AND THE OTHERS PURSED THEIR LIPS UP AND LOOKED WITH KNITTED GROWS TOWARD HIM
ALL IN A RAGE I ANSWERED THAT HE COULD NOT PLEASE ME BETTER THAN BY TAKING HIMSELF OFF
ONLY GO UP THERE AND YOU WILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. I WAS TO SOME EXTENT UNFAVOURABLY INFLUENCED BY THESE HINTS YET FAR FROM FORMING A CONCEPTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME
AS A BACKGROUND TO THE WOMEN THERE WAS SPREAD AN ESPALIER OF NATURAL JASMINES IN FULL BEAUTY 5 WHICH SET OFF THEIR CHARMS AND ESPECIALLY DIEGOS TO SUCH GREAT ADVANTAGE THAT WORDS WOULD FAIL TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT
AND AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE CARDINALS TITLE IS ENGRAVED UPON THE SEAL TOGETHER WITH A GREAT MANY ORNAMENTAL FIGURES
MESSER CHERUBINO AND THE MILANESE WENT ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS
WHY FATHER THIS MAN MY MASTER IS WORTH FAR MORE THAN ALL THE CARDINALS IN ROME. THEN THE DOCTOR TURNED TO ME AND SAID
SO I DEVOTED MYSELF ENTIRELY TO WORKING OUT THIS REVERSE WITH THE MOSES ON IT
ABOVE THE OBLONG WAS A SALAMANDER THE KINGS PARTICULAR DEVICE WITH MANY OTHER ORNAMENTS APPROPRIATE TO THE IONIC ARCHITECTURE OF THE WHOLE DESIGN
THIS WAS THE FIRST GREAT TRIAL I ENDURED IN FLORENCE TO BE MADE THE FATHER AND GUARDIAN OF SUCH A DISTRESSED FAMILY
WHEN THE DIN WAS OVER AND THE DAZZLING LIGHT EXTINGUISHED WE BEGAN TO LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE
AND HE BEGGED ME TO GO FORWARDS AND NOT TO SACRIFICE SO FINE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT
THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
MY SON OF WHAT USE DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE IF I CAME
THE FIGURE IN THE MIDDLE IS MEANT TO STAND FIFTY-FOUR FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND. AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE KING MADE A SIGN OF SURPRISE
WE DRIED OURSELVES TOOK REST AND SATISFIED OUR HUNGER WHILE CERTAIN WILD HERBS WERE APPLIED TO THE WOUNDED HORSE
IN ITALIAN ART SHE IS GENERALLY REPRESENTED HOLDING HER OWN EYES UPON A PLATE
NAY GO NOT YET AWHILE
WHAT SAYST THOU? I STAYED IN TWO MINDS WHETHER OR NOT TO DASH AT FULL SPEED DOWN THE STAIRCASE
WHERETO MAESTRO FRANCESCO WHO WAS A VERY CHOLERIC MAN REPLIED
SBIETTA WAS TO RENT THE FARM FROM ME AT SEVENTY GOLDEN CROWNS IN GOLD THE YEAR DURING THE WHOLE TERM OF MY NATURAL LIFE
FOR WHICH ACT OF SACRILEGE THE INQUISITION SENT HIM TO PRISON WHERE HE STARVED HIMSELF TO DEATH IN 1522
6 TO THINK HOW MANY WALK LIKE ME IN WOE
THE MAN RAISED HIS VOICE AND ORDERED ME EXPRESSLY IN THE DUKES NAME UNDER THE PENALTY OF HIS SEVERE DISPLEASURE TO SAY HOW MUCH I WANTED
NOTICING THAT THE TUMULT WAS NOT SUBSIDING I TOO ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND GIRDING ON MY SWORD-FOR EVERYBODY WORE ONE THEN-I WENT TO THE BRIDGE OF SANT AGNOLO WHERE I SAW A GROUP OF SEVERAL MEN ASSEMBLED
DUKE ALFONSO HIS FATHER WOULD SOONER HAVE ATTACKED AND TAKEN ROME WITH THIS MONEY THAN HAVE SHOWN IT TO THE POPE. NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO DISBURSE IT
IT WAS CLOSE UPON NIGHTFALL AND DURING THE DAY I HAD SHOT A GOOD NUMBER OF DUCKS AND GEESE
BUT I DESIRE YOU TO COMPLETE IT FOR ME IN ROME
THERE IS ONLY ONE MORE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH NOW THAT THE OCCASION OFFERS I PROPOSE TO RECORD
SO MUCH DID I HATE THAT ACCURSED MUSIC
TRIBOLO SHRUGGED UP HIS SHOULDERS AND MUTTERED
5 BY THE TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GREAT GATE PART OF THE FOEMEN HAD ALREADY ENTERED ROME AND WE HAD THEM IN OUR REAR
AT THAT TIME AS IS THE WONT OF YOUNG MEN I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A SICILIAN GIRL WHO WAS EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
PRITHEE TELL ME FRIEND GIOVANNI WHY YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONCE STARED AT ME IN THAT WAY? HE REPLIED
I MEAN THAT FATHER IN THE CASTLE! ASCANIO ANSWERED ON THE INSTANT
I ENTREATED HIM TO GRANT THIS PETITION SEEING THAT THE TIMES WERE MORE FOR FIGHTING THAN FOR MAKING STATUES
SO THEN OFF DASHED THE FOUR BRAVE LADS AND CAME UP WITH THE GUARD OF THE BARGELLO-UPWARDS OF FIFTY CONSTABLES COUNTING PIKES ARQUEBUSES AND TWO-HANDED-SWORDS
SEEING IM NOT THE FIRST BY FRAUD CONFINED THIS ILL OMIT
IT IS MOREOVER INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE GOD MARS
THE MANDRIANI WHICH I HAVE TRANSLATED BY IRON CROOKS WERE POLES FITTED AT THE END WITH CURVED IRONS BY WHICH THE OPENINGS OF THE FURNACE PLUGS OR IN ITALIAN SPINE COULD BE PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY DRIVEN BACK SO AS TO THE MOLTEN METAL FLOW THROUGH THE CHANNELS INTO THE MOULD
SHE BROUGHT FOOD AND DRINK TO THE MISERABLE BAGGAGE
AND THIS DID NOT AMOUNT TO THE VALUE OF 140 DUCATS FOR THAT WAS THE SUM I RECEIVED FROM THE MINT IN PERUGIA AND WITH IT I WENT HOME TO COMFORT MY POOR OLD FATHER. THE POPE SAID
SOME OTHER DAY ANOTHER MAN WILL TAKE MY PLACE AS GUARDIAN HERE. THINKING THAT I COULD GO OF WITH A QUIET MIND I TOOK PAGOLO ASCANIO AND CHIOCCIA TO THE GARDEN WHERE WE SPENT A LARGE PORTION OF THE DAY AGREEABLY
THERE WAS AN OLD TREASURER IN THE SERVICE OF THE DUKE WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY HIS FATHER DUKE ALFONSO AND WAS CALLED MESSER GIROLAMO GILIOLO
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE THE EXACT SENSE OF PERTANTO AND PERCHè IN THE TEXT BUT I THINK THE DRIFT OF THE SENTENCE IS RENDERED ABOVE
APROPOS OF WHICH I SAID
XL MADAME DETAMPES WHEN SHE HEARD HOW WELL MY AFFAIRS WERE GOING REDOUBLED HER SPITE AGAINST ME SAYING IN HER OWN HEART
TO WHICH I REPLIED
I ASCENDED TO THE KEEP AND AT THE SAME INSTANT POPE CLEMENT CAME IN THROUGH THE CORRIDORS INTO THE CASTLE
THIS WAS THE POPES HINT TO CELLINI THAT HE WAS AWARE OF THE MURDER HE HAD JUST COMMITTED
THIS MAN SET HIMSELF TO WORK AND COMPOSED FOUR SONNETS COUCHED IN THE CHOICEST STYLE AND FULL OF HONOUR TO MYSELF
SHE TURNED TO THE ROMAN LADY AND SAID
CELLINIS PHILOSOPHY IS SUMMED UP IN THE PROVERB
IN A FEW DAYS I FINISHED THE HEAD IN STEEL AND IT WAS THE FINEST WORK OF THE KIND WHICH I HAD EVER PRODUCED
HAVE NO OTHER THOUGHT FOR I AM NOW DETERMINED TO PUT IN MY APPEARANCE
AT LAST HE BADE ME APPLY MYSELF TO BUSINESS AND COMPLETE HIS PERSEUS
OF SOME MISREPRESENTATIONS SOME SUPPRESSIONS OF DAMAGING FACTS THERE SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE ONLY TOO GOOD-A MAN WITH CELLINIS PASSION FOR PROVING HIMSELF IN THE RIGHT COULD HARDLY HAVE AVOIDED BEING GUILTY OF SUCH
SAINT AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS, SAMUEL PEPYS IN HIS DIARY, ROUSSEAU IN HIS CONFESSIONS. IT IS AMONG THESE EXTRAORDINARY DOCUMENTS AND UNSURPASSED BY ANY OF THEM THAT THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENVENUTO CELLINI TAKES ITS PLACE
WHEN THE DIRTY STUPID SCOUNDREL OBSERVED THAT THOSE GENTLEMEN KEPT ON LAUGHING HE TRIED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND DIVERT THEM FROM DERIDING HIM
114
IN A MOMENT NEW HOPE TOOK POSSESSION OF MY SOUL AND I EXCLAIMED
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED IT PLEASED THE DUKE SO MUCH THAT HE HEAPED FAVOURS ON ME AND GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD KEEP ME IN HIS SERVICE WITH SUCH APPOINTMENTS AS SHOULD ENABLE ME TO LIVE IN AFFLUENCE
IN THE LATTER CITY I MET DUKE PIER LUIGI UPON THE STREET WHO STARED ME IN THE FACE AND RECOGNISED ME
FOR HAVING SUCCEEDED IN PLEASING HIM WITH MY WORK I WANTED HIM TO BE NO LESS PLEASED WITH MY DISCOURSE
FOR IF IT WERE SUITABLY ILLUMINATED IT WOULD SHOW ITSELF TO BE THE FINE PERFORMANCE THAT IT IS. THIS LETTER ABOUNDED WITH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE AND COMPLIMENTARY EXPRESSIONS TOWARDS MYSELF
DO YOU LIKEWISE YOUR DUTY FOR THESE ARE HIGHWAY ROBBERS WHO HAVE USED THIS LITTLE INCIDENT TO CONTRIVE OUR MURDER. THE INNKEEPER AT WHOSE HOUSE WE HAD DINED CALLED ONE OF THE LEADERS AN IMPOSING OLD MAN AND BEGGED HIM TO PUT A STOP TO THE DISORDER SAYING
IN THIS WAY THAT DAY ENDED AND I CAME OFF SAFE AND SOUND FOR WHICH MAY GOD BE PRAISED AND THANKED
II IT IS TRUE THAT MEN WHO HAVE LABOURED WITH SOME SHOW OF EXCELLENCE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN KNOWLEDGE OF THEMSELVES TO THE WORLD
HE WOULD SUPPLY ME WITH PROVISIONS
MY HEART WAS SORELY TORN ASUNDER AT ONE MOMENT BY THE DESIRE TO REACH FLORENCE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND AT ANOTHER BY THE CONVICTION THAT I OUGHT TO REGAIN FRANCE
AND WHAT INCREASED MY RAGE WAS THAT HE HAD USED THESE BOASTFUL WORDS
XII
GRASSUCCIO RETURNED TO FLORENCE SOUGHT OUT MY FATHER AND GAVE HIM THE NEWS OF MY SAFE ESCAPE
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL TOUCH HIM
AND YET MY BRAIN REMAINED AS CLEAR AND STRONG AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE MY ILLNESS
THE OCCASION TO WHICH I REFER WAS THIS
1 WATCHING HIS OPPORTUNITY 2 HE SAID
HE REPLIED THAT HE BOUGHT IT AND THAT HE ONLY WANTED MY OPINION
I THOUGHT FOR CERTAIN THAT THE GREAT KING FRANCIS WOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED ME
THIS IS A BRAVE ITALIAN AND CERTAINLY NOT THE MAN WE ARE AFTER
IF YOU HAD DISCOVERED ANYTHING MISSING ON THAT RECORD THEN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEIZED ALL MY BOOKS TOGETHER WITH MYSELF
IT IS A PIECE OF ORDNANCE LARGER AND LONGER THAN A SWIVEL AND ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DEMICULVERIN
SO WE PAID THEM IN THE WAY THEY WANTED AND AFTERWARDS WE RETIRED TO REST
VASARI SAYS THAT A YOUNG MAN OF WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN ILL MURDERED HIM
SOME OTHER GENTLEMEN OF THE SAID COUNT WENT WITH US AS WELL AS LIONARDO TEDALDI OUR FELLOW-CITIZEN OF FLORENCE
FOR THAT A POPE IS NOT OF THE SAME KIND AS CERTAIN PETTY TYRANT PRINCES WHO TREAT THEIR FOLK AS BADLY AS THEY CAN WITHOUT REGARD TO LAW OR JUSTICE
I SHOWED HIM TWO LITTLE MODELS OF DIFFERENT DESIGN
WHEN IT IS FINISHED AND YOU ARE RESTORED TO HEALTH BRING IT ME AND COME TO SEE ME. AFTERWARDS IN COURSE OF CONVERSATION HE CALLED ME BY MY NAME WHICH MADE ME WONDER BECAUSE NO WORDS HAD BEEN DROPPED IN WHICH MY NAME OCCURRED
DO THEN TO THAT WHICH IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL ALL THE EVIL YOU ARE ABLE. THE CAPTAIN IN SOME ALARM AND NOT KNOWING WHAT I MIGHT BE ON THE POINT OF DOING SAID TO FOUR OF HIS TALLEST FELLOWS
GET UP BROTHER
DURING EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE FESTIVAL WE PRACTISED TWO HOURS A DAY TOGETHER
HOWEVER I FOUND LITTLE ELSE TO DO BUT JEWEL-SETTING
THUS THEN AGAINST MY WILL I PIECED THE BROKEN THREAD AGAIN AND SET TO WORK
JUST THEN ARRIVED DON DIEGO FRANCESCO ASCANIO AND HIS FATHER WHOM I DID NOT KNOW
HE POSTPONED THE EXECUTION HOWEVER TILL AFTER CORPUS DOMINI
AND WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER WE ALL MOUNTED AND WENT OFF TOGETHER
IT CORRESPONDED TO A SENATE
NO SOONER DID HE SET EYES UPON ME THAN HE CRIED
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE STORY OF THE ARTISTS CLUB AND OF THE FARCICAL ADVENTURES WHICH HAPPENED OWING TO THE WOMAN WHOM I MENTIONED PANTASILEA THE ONE WHO FELT FOR ME THAT FALSE AND FULSOME LOVE
IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY OWN BODY YOU COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT BETTER AS THIS PROVES
IN SPITE OF ITS GREAT DIFFICULTIES IT GAVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE THAT I LOOKED UPON THEM AS RECREATION
NOW THAT IT IS THY WILL THAT I SHOULD GO TO PRISON WITH ALL MY HEART I THANK THEE FOR THIS DISPENSATION. THEREAT I TURNED ROUND TO THE TWO CHAMBERLAINS AND ADDRESSED THEM WITH A CERTAIN LOWERING LOOK I HAVE
XCI THE GREAT COMPLIMENTS WHICH THIS SHORT INSPECTION OF MY PERSEUS HAD ELICITED FROM THE NOBLE SCHOOL OF FLORENCE THOUGH THEY WERE WELL KNOWN TO THE DUKE DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM SAYING
THAT IS A HANDSOME THING THAT OTHER IS STILL HANDSOMER; AND LIKEWISE WITH MY MODELS AND OTHER TRIFLES SO THAT AT LAST HE DROVE ME WILD WITH ANNOYANCE
MY HORSE BECAME RESTIVE WITH FRIGHT
I ANSWERED THAT HAD THEY DONE THEIR DUTY BY ME I SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN OF THEM WHAT ONE SPEAKS OF GOOD AND WORTHY MEN
BUT IF YOU REMEMBER IT WAS ONLY A SHORT TIME AGO THAT I WARNED YOU OF IT
ROUND ABOUT IT RAN A LEGEND IN THESE WORDS
AND FROM THE GENEROUS DONOR I CANNOT ACCEPT THEM SEEING I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PRESENT HIM WITH ANY SPECIMEN OF MY CRAFT. THE GOOD FELLOW SAID THAT IF I DID NOT TAKE THEM I SHOULD GET NO OTHER HORSES IN PADUA AND SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE MY JOURNEY ON FOOT
THE REASON IS THAT SOME BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE HAS OCCURRED WHICH I MUST TRANSACT FOR MY BROTHER SBIETTA
HE WANTED THE BOOK TO BE ENCLOSED IN A CASE OF MASSIVE GOLD RICHLY WORKED AND ADORNED WITH JEWELS VALUED AT ABOUT SIX THOUSAND CROWNS
THE RAGE OF THIS VINDICTIVE WOMAN KEPT CONTINUALLY ON THE INCREASE
AND MY BROTHER DEALT SO VALIANTLY THAT AFTER HAVING BADLY WOUNDED HIM HE WAS UPON THE POINT OF FOLLOWING UP HIS ADVANTAGE
IN ORDER TO GET INSIDE ROME ITSELF CELLINI HAD TO PASS A SECOND GATE
THE DUKE FREQUENTLY SIGNED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD JOIN IN PRESSING ME TO STAY
2 ON THE SAME OCCASION I SHOWED GIULIANO MY LITTLE MODEL IN WAX WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM MICHEL AGNOLOS DRAWING
INTERPRET THE AFFAIR AS YOU LIKE BEST BENVENUTO
VINCENZO DANTI WAS BORN AT PERUGIA IN 1530
AND AFTER THIS WISE WE SHOULD BECOME THE RICHEST OF MANKIND
I RECEIVED THE PRATO GATE AND THE LITTLE ONE OF ARNO WHICH IS ON THE WAY TO THE MILLS
AS I HAVE SAID THEN I RODE TO POGGIO WITH THE SOLE OBJECT OF PAYING MY RESPECTS AND WITH NO INTENTION OF ACCEPTING SERVICE UNDER HIM AS GOD WHO DOES ALL THINGS WELL DID THEN APPOINT FOR ME
SEARCH DILIGENTLY AFTER MY FRIEND BENVENUTO
THEN I SAID TO MY YOUNG MEN
WHILE I WAS POURING OUT THESE ENTREATIES HE GAVE STRICT ORDERS TO HAVE ME BOUND AND TAKEN AND LOCKED UP IN PRISON
THESE COMMUNICATIONS HE MINGLED WITH DISCOURSE ON DIVERS PLEASANT MATTERS
SO I ENTERED THE ROOM AND PRESENTED THE DIAMOND RING UPON WHICH HE DREW ME ASIDE AND THE MARQUIS RETIRED TO A DISTANCE
FOR THESE REASONS I MEANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE HOUSE OF HER EXCELLENCY WHICH WAS A VERY FINE PALACE SITUATED IN BORGIO VECCHIO
I REPLIED TO THESE ARGUMENTS THAT HE MIGHT BE SPEAKING THE TRUTH AS A FRIAR BUT THAT AS A MAN HE SPOKE THE CONTRARY
AND BEING VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THE WORKMANSHIP HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT VALUED IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE PROPERLY PAID
FOR IF HE HAD TOLD ME WHEN ASCANIO FIRST CAME BACK TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN HIS HOUSE I SHOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN HIM LEAVE
MOST BLESSED FATHER IF YOU SET THAT MAN FREE HE WILL DO SOMETHING STILL MORE MARVELLOUS BECAUSE HE HAS BY FAR TOO BOLD A SPIRIT
ALL MEN WHO WISH TO PASS FOR PERSONS OF WORTH ALLOW IT TO BE SEEN THAT THEY ARE SO BY THEIR ACTIONS
THEY USED TO BE WRITTEN ON TRIFLING OR OBSCENE SUBJECTS IN A MOCK-HEROIC STYLE
AT LYONS WE WAITED SEVERAL DAYS FOR THE MULETEER WHO CARRIED THE SILVER CUP AND BASIN AS WELL AS OUR OTHER BAGGAGE
I FARTHER ADDED THAT IF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY GAVE ME BUT A CRAZIA 2 WHICH IS WORTH FIVE FARTHINGS FOR MY WORK I SHOULD CONSIDER MYSELF CONTENTED PROVIDED ONLY THAT HIS EXCELLENCY DID NOT DEPRIVE ME OF HIS FAVOUR
MESSER BASTIANO IS THE CELEBRATED PAINTER SEBASTIAN DEL PIOMBO BORN 1485 DIED 1547
THAT FELLOW SETS GREAT STORE ON HIMSELF FOR HE IS REFUSING THREE HUNDRED DUCATS A YEAR. ANOTHER WHO WAS A MAN OF TALENT REPLIED
SO THAT IF THE HORSE FELL HE WOULD HAVE COME PRECISELY ON THEM
3 SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IT SHOWS NO TALENT
AND INSOMUCH AS HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT MY FORBEARANCE HAD NOT BEEN INSPIRED BY WANT OF COURAGE BUT BY THE MOST DARING BRAVERY FOR HE KNEW ME DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF MY NATURE HE TOOK MY WORDS UP AND BEGGED ME TO FAVOUR HIM SO FAR AS TO ASSOCIATE HIM WITH MYSELF IN ALL I MEANT TO DO
6 I DID NOT KNOW HIM BUT WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS INCOMPARABLE MASTERPIECES
GIANPAGOLO WENT TO SPAIN AND SERVED PHILIP II
THERE WERE MANY NOBLEMEN OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE PRESENT WHICH MADE HIM BLUSH A LITTLE AS IT WERE FOR SHAME
BENVENUTO THIS FIGURE CANNOT SUCCEED IN BRONZE
I DID NOT TELL THE CARDINAL TO GO SO BRUTALLY ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
WAIT AND SEE BENVENUTO
AND NO SOONER HAD HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME THAN HE SWORE IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO COME TO ME UPON THE SPOT
FOR I ALONE KNOW WHAT TRAVAIL I HAVE ENDURED AND THAT MY EARNEST FAITH HAS MOVED HIM TO ASSIST ME
BUT THE BARGELLO LIKE AN EXPERIENCED PERSON TOLD THEM
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT SINCE THESE ARTICLES WERE OF GREAT VALUE AND THE HIGHEST BEAUTY I FELT UNEASINESS IN CASE THE KING SHOULD DIE AND I HAD LATELY LEFT HIM IN A VERY BAD STATE OF HEALTH
WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE SHOP LUCAGNOLO HAD THE MONEY FOR HIS VASE IN A PAPER PACKET
2 ON HIS ASKING ME IF I HAD EVER BEEN AT VENICE I SAID NO
UPON MY WORD BENVENUTO DESERVES TO HAVE THE MARBLE. THEN THEY BOTH PAID ME THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS ESPECIALLY THE ENVOY FROM LUCCA WHO WAS A PERSON OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LEARNING
WANTING THEN TO FINISH OFF MY FONTAINEBLEAU WHICH WAS ALREADY CAST IN BRONZE AS WELL AS TO EXECUTE THE TWO VICTORIES WHICH WERE GOING TO FILL THE ANGLES ABOVE THE LUNETTE OF THE DOOR I ENGAGED A POOR GIRL OF THE AGE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN
WHO ARE YOU THEN YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? I REPLIED
QUITE TRUE
THIS SO INCREASED HIS DESIRE TO SEE IT FINISHED THAT I WAS SORRY I HAD SHOWN IT
IN 1534
ON THIS HE WAVED HIS HAND AND THE TWO PRELATES RETIRED TO A DISTANCE FROM US
UPON MY WORD THIS IS A MAN TO BE LOVED AND CHERISHED BY EVERY ONE WHO KNOWS HIM. THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD VERY GLADLY SEE MY MODEL
BUT OF ONE THING ONLY I WARN YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE ENJOYED A WOMAN YOU ARE DOOMED. TO THIS I REPLIED
FOR THE REST HE WELL KNEW HIM TO BE A MAN OF WORTH AND COURAGE HE THEN TURNED TO HIS ATTENDANTS ORDERING THEM TO SEE THAT THE BRAVE YOUNG FELLOW WANTED FOR NOTHING
L RETURNING TO THE MONUMENT I SHOULD RELATE THAT CERTAIN FAMOUS MEN OF LETTERS WHO KNEW MY BROTHER COMPOSED FOR ME AN EPITAPH TELLING ME THAT THE NOBLE YOUNG MAN DESERVED IT
ALSO MONTAZIOS PRIGIONIERI DEL MASTIO DI VOLTERRA CAP
FOR BEFORE YOU LOSE SIGHT OF HIM WHO DID THE MISCHIEF YOU SHALL SEE YOURSELF REVENGED BY MY HAND. OUR WORDS ON BOTH SIDES WERE TO THE PURPORT BUT OF THE SHORTEST
AND I USED IT WITH SUCH DEXTERITY OF HAND AND TONGUE THAT MY FATHER COMING SUDDENLY UPON ME BLESSED ME A THOUSAND TIMES EXCLAIMING THAT WHILE I WAS AWAY FROM HIM I HAD MADE GREAT PROGRESS AS HE THOUGHT
I WENT ON UNCOVERING THE STATUE WITH SUCCESS AND ASCERTAINED THAT EVERYTHING HAD COME OUT IN PERFECT ORDER UNTIL I REACHED THE FOOT OF THE RIGHT LEG ON WHICH THE STATUE RESTS
SO I WENT AT ONCE TO CONFER WITH A FINE OLD MAN CALLED BEVILACQUA WHO WAS REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST SWORD OF ITALY BECAUSE HE HAD FOUGHT MORE THAN TWENTY SERIOUS DUELS AND HAD ALWAYS COME OFF WITH HONOUR
SO THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED AN ENTRANCE WITH MORE FREEDOM
HE TOLD THE GUARD THAT THE DUST HE GAVE HIM BACK WAS THE DIAMOND IN QUESTION PROPERLY GROUND DOWN
I WOULD HAVE MYSELF WRAPPED UP IN A MATTRESS AND CARRIED TO A SAFE PLACE OUTSIDE ROME
WHITHER AM I NOW TO GO
MESSER ANTONIO THE OLD CASTELLANS BROTHER AND HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE OFFICE INSISTED ON EXTRACTING FROM ME THE COSTS FOR FOOD AND OTHER FEES AND PERQUISITES CLAIMED BY SHERIFFS AND SUCH FRY PAYING NO HEED TO HIS PREDECESSORS WILL IN MY BEHALF
SO AT LAST IT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO MAKE THEM MARRY AND COMPLETE MY VENGEANCE AT A LATER PERIOD
2 THIS EXCHANGE EXCITED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LOVERS ANGER BECAUSE THE LADY SEEING I HAD ABANDONED HER AT BACHIACCAS FIRST ENTREATY IMAGINED THAT I HELD IN SLIGHT ESTEEM THE GREAT AFFECTION WHICH SHE BORE ME
BUT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE
FOR BEING RATHER TOO BILIOUS BY NATURE FAST UPSETS ME SO THAT I RUN THE RISK NOW OF FALLING FROM EXHAUSTION TO THE EARTH. WHILE I WAS PUMPING OUT THESE WORDS WITH DIFFICULTY THEY BROUGHT SOME ADMIRABLE WINE AND OTHER DELICACIES FOR A HEARTY MEAL
NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU INSCRIBED AMONG OUR COMPANY. I REPLIED
FOR THESE MEN COULD NOT WORK IN BRONZE
IF THEY DO THE CONTRARY THEY LOSE THE NAME OF HONEST MEN
LOOK NOW THE POOR CREATURE IS SO FRIGHTENED THAT IT HARDLY VENTURES TO PUT ITS HEAD OUT. I RAISED MY EYES AND SAID
NOW THAT YOU ARE CURED BENVENUTO TAKE HEED HOW YOU LIVE. 5 I WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS MEANING PROMISED THAT I WOULD
NOW BEING AS I WAS I SHOULD DEPART WITH THE ANODYNE OF SLEEPINESS WHICH ROBBED DEATH OF HALF ITS FORMER TERRORS
HE ALLOWED SOME DAYS TO PASS DURING WHICH HE READ ME THE SERMONS OF FRA JEROLIMO SAVONAROLA
GO TO
NOT HERE I FIND MY FOE DURANTES STING! YET ERST MY MIND UNTO HIGH GOD I BROUGHT BESEECHING HIM TO PARDON ALL MY SIN AND SPOKE A MISERERE SORROW-FRAUGHT
CXXV AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW DAYS THE CASTELLAN WHO NOW BELIEVED THAT I WAS AT LARGE AND FREE SUCCUMBED TO HIS DISEASE AND DEPARTED THIS LIFE
HIS BREASTS AND ALL THE MUSCLES OF THE BODY ARE NOT PORTRAYED FROM A MAN BUT FROM A BIG SACK FULL OF MELONS SET UPRIGHT AGAINST A WALL
WHEN EVERY OTHER STONE IS POUNDED THAT EXTREME SHARPNESS OF EDGE IS LOST
I EXPRESSED MY INCLINATION TO HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP TO TRAVEL IN HIS SUITE
MAKING OFF I TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOUSE OF MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI CLERK OF THE CAMERA WITH THE INTENTION OF PREPARING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM ROME
MY POOR BROTHER RUSHED AHEAD AND HAVING RECOGNISED THE HOMICIDE BY THOSE SIGNS HE THREW HIMSELF WITH ALL HIS DASH AND SPIRIT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BAND AND BEFORE HIS MAN COULD TURN ON GUARD RAN HIM RIGHT THROUGH THE GUTS AND WITH THE SWORDS HILT THRUST HIM TO THE GROUND
TENEVANO MOLTO CONTO DI ME THIS IS PERHAPS EQUIVALENT TO HELD ME IN HIGH ESTEEM BUT CELLINI USES THE SAME PHRASE WITH THE MEANING I HAVE GIVEN ABOVE IN BOOK I CHAP
AND THIS RICH COVER OF GOLD AND JEWELS IS UNFINISHED AS YOU HERE BEHOLD IT BY REASON OF MY ILLNESS
AGAIN THE RIGHT LEG OF HERCULES AND THAT OF CACUS HAVE GOT ONE MASS OF FLESH BETWEEN THEM SO THAT IF THEY WERE TO BE SEPARATED NOT ONLY ONE OF THEM BUT BOTH TOGETHER WOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT A CALF AT THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE TOUCHING
AFTERWARDS HE FOUGHT FOR THE FRENCH IN THE ITALIAN WARS
I CAN INDEED AND WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE AFFIRM THAT ALL I AM WHATEVER OF GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL I HAVE PRODUCED ALL THIS MUST BE ASCRIBED TO THAT EXTRAORDINARY MONARCH
THEY ARE LETTERS OF NATURALISATION. THEN HE TOLD ME HOW THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO PIERO STROZZI AT HIS PARTICULAR REQUEST AND ONLY AFTER A LONG TIME OF WAITING AS A SPECIAL MARK OF FAVOUR
AND WHEN HE DISTINGUISHED THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE SYSTEM HE EXCLAIMED GOOD HUMOUREDLY
YOU WANT PERHAPS TO MAKE ME CROSS BLADES WITH YOU? I FACED ROUND IN GREAT FURY FOR THE MAN HAD STIRRED MY BLOOD AND CRIED OUT
HE RAN DOWN AND NOT FINDING THE THIEF IN THE SHOP FLEW AFTER HIM
I TOO ASSUMED AN AIR OF MENACE AND MATCHING HIS OWN ARROGANCE WITH SOMETHING OF THE SAME SORT TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT MEN OF MY KIND WERE WORTHY TO CONVERSE WITH POPES AND EMPERORS AND GREAT KINGS AND THAT PERHAPS THERE WERE NOT TWO SUCH MEN ALIVE UPON THIS EARTH WHILE TEN OF HIS SORT MIGHT BE MET AT EVERY DOORWAY
AND THAT FOR HIS SAKE I OUGHT TO BEAR THIS INJUSTICE FOR GOD WOULD INCREASE ME IN ALL GOOD THINGS
TOO WELL I KNEW ALREADY THE GREAT AND IRREPARABLE SACRIFICE I MADE WHEN I LEFT FRANCE
BUT HE BADE ME KEEP MY EYES OPEN AND BE ON THE LOOK OUT AGAINST SOME ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME IN THAT CONNECTION AND PUT RESTRAINT UPON MYSELF TO ENDURE SOMEWHAT AGAINST MY INCLINATION FOR HE COULD DISCERN A GREAT AND IMMINENT DANGER IN IT
THIS EXCHANGE OF IRONICAL COMPLIMENTS TESTIFIES TO CELLINIS STRONG MEDICEAN LEANINGS AND ALSO TO THE SAGACITY WITH WHICH HE JUDGED THE POLITICAL SITUATION
HE WAS CALLED MESSER PIER GIOVANNI AND WAS AN OFFICER OF THE WARDROBE
BUT SHE PUT OFF TAKING THE VEIL IN ORDER TO KEEP HOUSE FOR OUR OLD FATHER AND TO LOOK AFTER MY YOUNGER SISTER WHO WAS MARRIED TO ONE BARTOLOMMEO A SURGEON
2 I SAID TO MY BROTHER
TO ARMS TO ARMS
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO WHAT A MAN BENVENUTO IS
BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND COMFORT YOUR HEART FOR BY THIS HAND WHICH I AM HOLDING YOU ARE FREE AND IF YOU LIVE SHALL LIVE IN HAPPINESS. WHILE THUS CONVERSING WITH ME HE HAD KEPT A WHOLE HEAP OF GREAT LORDS AND NOBLEMEN WAITING WHO WERE COME TO VISIT ME SAYING ONE TO THE OTHER
HE WAS A YOUTH OF SIXTEEN AT THIS EPOCH
BESIDE WHAT I COPIED I ENRICHED IT WITH SO MANY ELEGANT MASKS OF MY INVENTION THAT MY MASTER WENT ABOUT SHOWING IT THROUGH THE ART AND BOASTING THAT SO GOOD A PIECE OF WORK HAD BEEN TURNED OUT FROM HIS SHOP
FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT GO
IT IS A CHRIST OF THE WHITEST MARBLE SET UPON A CROSS OF THE BLACKEST EXACTLY OF THE SAME SIZE AS A TALL MAN
WHILE THUS ENGROSSED IN THOUGHTS ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS I WENT ABROAD FOR PASTIME THROUGH THAT BEAUTIFUL AND SUMPTUOUS CITY AND PAID VISITS TO THE ADMIRABLE PAINTER TITIAN AND TO JACOPO DEL SANSOVINO OUR ABLE SCULPTOR AND ARCHITECT FROM FLORENCE
ACCORDINGLY I CALLED THE FELLOW APART AND SAID TO HIM PAGOLO MY DEAREST BROTHER YOU KNOW WHAT A GOOD PLACE YOU HAVE WITH ME AND HOW YOU HAD FORMERLY NOTHING TO DEPEND ON
8 I SAW THE DEATH WHO RACKS OUR SOULS WITH FEARS
FOR MY FRIEND BENVENUTO WHO HAS MADE A SPLENDID MODEL WITH A VIEW TO IT. THIS WAS REPORTED TO ME BY MEN WHOM I COULD TRUST
YOU HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE CARDINAL AND FOR THIS REASON I WILL NOT COME. THE MAN SAID THAT SINCE GENTLE USAGE WOULD NOT BRING ME HE HAD AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE FOLK AND THEY WOULD TAKE ME BOUND HAND AND FOOT LIKE A PRISONER
AND WHEN I LIFTED MY EYES I DISCERNED THAT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE SUN WAS STRIKING ON A WALL AS IT WERE A HOUSE-FRONT JUST ABOVE MY HEAD
AND WHEN I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM EVERYWHERE ELSE TO PAY IN THE MORNING HE ANSWERED
I DONT WANT YOU TO BEAR WITNESS ON MY BEHALF TO THIS WORTHY MAN YOUR MASTER BECAUSE I HOPE MY HANDS ARE SUCH THAT WITHOUT AID FROM YOU THEY WILL DECLARE WHAT SORT OF A FELLOW I AM. NOTE 1
IT HAD BEEN TALKED OF THESE EIGHTEEN MONTHS PAST
MAESTRO GIOVANNI BESIDES MUSIC TEACH THE BOY THOSE OTHER ARTS WHICH DO YOU SO MUCH HONOUR. TO WHICH MY FATHER ANSWERED
CXXII I HAD BARELY UTTERED THESE WORDS WHEN THAT INVISIBLE BEING LIKE A WHIRLWIND CAUGHT ME UP AND BORE ME AWAY INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE HE MADE HIMSELF VISIBLE TO MY EYES IN HUMAN FORM APPEARING LIKE A YOUNG MAN WHOSE BEARD IS JUST GROWING WITH A FACE OF INDESCRIBABLE BEAUTY BUT AUSTERE NOT WANTON
IT IS BELIEVED THAT WHEN THE CARDINAL HEARD MY PETITION HE WAS NOT ILL-DISPOSED TO GRANT IT
I TOLD HIM THAT THE TIME HAD NOT YET COME FOR MOVING
THERE IN THE HEAD ITSELF HE MADE HER UP A PLACE TO SLEEP IN
AT THIS HE BEGAN TO THREATEN ME WITH HIS HEAD AND SETTING HIS LEFT HAND ON THE POMMEL OF HIS SWORD TILTED THE POINT UP AND EXCLAIMED
WHEN MAESTRO FRANCESCO APPEARED HE SAID IT WAS HIS DEAREST WISH TO SAVE MY LIFE AND THAT HE HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS DAYS SEEN GREATER FORCE IN A YOUNG MAN THAN I HAD
IPPOLITO DE MEDICI WAS A CARDINAL MUCH AGAINST HIS NATURAL INCLINATION
GIORGIO VASARI
AND WHEN WE PASSED THE PAGLIA WE MET A COURIER CARRYING NEWS OF THE NEW POPE CLEMENT VII
ALSO SOMETIMES JEWELS AS FOR INSTANCE EMERALDS SAPPHIRES DIAMONDS AND RUBIES
AH WOE IS ME! THE CLAMOUR WOKE ME AND I RUSHED OUT IN A PANIC
FURTHERMORE HE TOLD ME TO GO TO PARIS AND SEEK OUT A PLACE TO LIVE IN FITTED FOR THE EXECUTION OF SUCH WORK
NO SOONER HAD HIS MAJESTY SET EYES UPON ME THAN HE CALLED ME CHEERFULLY AND ASKED IF I HAD SOMETHING FINE TO EXHIBIT AT MY LODGING FOR HE WOULD COME TO INSPECT IT
AT THESE WORDS THE POOR OLD MAN WAS GREATLY DISTURBED AND BEGGED ME FOR GODS SAKE NOT TO TURN MY THOUGHTS TO SUCH AN ENTERPRISE ALTHOUGH HE KNEW I SHOULD BE FIT FOR THIS OR YET A GREATER BUSINESS ADDING THAT HIS OTHER SON MY BROTHER WAS ALREADY A MOST VALIANT SOLDIER AND THAT I OUGHT TO PURSUE THE NOBLE ART IN WHICH I HAD LABOURED SO MANY YEARS AND WITH SUCH DILIGENCE OF STUDY
ANOTHER OF THE HAILSTONES HIT MY HORSE UPON THE HEAD AND ALMOST STUNNED HIM
AND WHEN I SAY FEVER I MEAN FEVER AND NO MERE METAPHOR
WHEN THE KEYS WERE ORDERED THE LOCKSMITH REVEALED THEIR PLOT
THERE WAS ALSO A MANUFACTURER OF SALTPETRE
NOR WOULD I HAVE UNDERTAKEN IT AT THE COMMISSION OF ANY PRINCE WHATEVER FOR FEAR I MIGHT PROVE INADEQUATE TO THE TASK
FOR WHEN THEY ARE CAST INTO IT THE FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP PIT IN THE FOUNDATION OF THE CASTLE
SO I WENT ON HOLDING MY SWORD AT HIS THROAT AND NOW AND THEN JUST PRICKED HIM WITH THE POINT POURING OUT A TORRENT OF TERRIFIC THREATS AT THE SAME TIME
MEANWHILE I LABOURED ASSIDUOUSLY AT THE WORK I WAS DOING FOR THE POPE AND ALSO IN THE SERVICE OF THE MINT
ADD PERILS TO YOUR LIFE
AN ACCIDENT WHICH WE EXPRESS BY BEING CAKED. 1 I TOLD TWO OF THE HANDS TO CROSS THE ROAD AND FETCH FROM THE HOUSE OF THE BUTCHER CAPRETTA A LOAD OF YOUNG OAK-WOOD WHICH HAD LAIN DRY FOR ABOVE A YEAR
WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS I THANKED HIS MAJESTY WITH HEARTINESS
I HAVE SEEN YOU YIELD AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME TO THE HOTTEST ANGER I EVER OBSERVED AND THEN TO THE WARMEST COMPASSION
FOR A LONG WHILE I KEPT ANXIOUSLY REVOLVING THE MATTER
HIS ACCOMPLICE WAS SENT TO THE GALLEYS
PIERO WAS THE EXILED SON OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT
WHEN THE MULETEER ARRIVED WE LOADED ALL OUR GOODS UPON A LITTLE CART AND THEN SET OFF TOWARD PARIS
FULL SPACE AND PLACE IVE LEFT FOR PRISON WEAL
THIS I EMPTIED AND LOADED IT AGAIN WITH A GOOD CHARGE OF FINE POWDER MIXED WITH THE COARSER SORT
THE DESIGN WAS GIVEN BY GIULIANO THE SON OF THAT BACCIO DAGNOLO THE WOOD-CARVER WHO SPOILED THE CUPOLA
THIS IS AN ACT OF TREASON DONE BY MALICE PREPENSE
UPON MY WORD THIS PERPETUAL GOING AND COMING OF YOURS HAS GROWN TO BE TOO GREAT A NUISANCE. I REPLIED AS GENTLY AS I COULD
THIS I PERFORMED WITH SCRUPULOUS REGARD TO ALL THE RULES OF ART
HE MEANT IT FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF FONTAINEBLEAU
XLIV DURING THE TIME WHEN FLORENCE WAS BESIEGED FEDERIGO GINORI FOR WHOM I MADE THAT MEDAL OF ATLAS DIED OF CONSUMPTION AND THE MEDAL CAME INTO THE HANDS OF MESSER LUIGI ALAMANNI WHO AFTER A LITTLE WHILE TOOK IT TO PRESENT IN PERSON TO FRANCIS KING OF FRANCE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME OF HIS OWN FINEST COMPOSITIONS
I VERILY BELIEVE THAT THIS BENVENUTO PRIDES HIMSELF ON CONTRADICTING EVERYTHING ONE SAYS. THEN HE FACED ROUND TO ME WITH A TOUCH OF MOCKERY UPON WHICH HIS ATTENDANTS DID THE LIKE AND BEGAN TO SPEAK AS FOLLOWS
GOSSIP FOR SO WE USED TO NAME OURSELVES FOR FUN
HE WANTED A PAIR MADE OF EQUAL SIZE
HE KNEW ME AS AN ARTIST AND HAD ALSO BEEN CONCERNED AS INTERMEDIARY IN CERTAIN UGLY QUARRELS BETWEEN ME AND OTHERS
I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD ASKED HIM WHO THE MAN WAS THAT HAD KILLED HIM AND IF HE COULD RECOGNISE HIM
AT THE END OF THIS TIME BEING REFRESHED IN STRENGTH AND SPIRITS WE RESUMED OUR JOURNEY AND PASSED THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT MISHAP
WHEN DAY BROKE FEELING AN INTENSE HEAT IN THE RECTUM I LOOKED EAGERLY TO SEE WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN AND FOUND THE CLOTH COVERED WITH BLOOD
THIS ENCOURAGED ME TO APPLY MYSELF WITH UNTROUBLED SPIRIT TO THE TASK
IT IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES SINCE I TOLD HIM I SHOULD SOON HAVE NEED OF HIM. WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE ALBERTACCIO AND I EMBRACED WITH MEASURELESS AFFECTION
HE ADDED THAT IF I DID NOT THINK MY WORK QUITE READY TO BE SEEN YET I MIGHT SAY SO FRANKLY SINCE THE DUKE KNEW WELL THAT I HAD ENJOYED BUT LITTLE ASSISTANCE FOR SO LARGE AN UNDERTAKING
HE TREATED ME VERY WELL AND WAS EVEN BETTER PAID BY ME IN RETURN
1 NOW THE NARCISSUS STOOD UPON A SQUARE OF WOOD AND THE WATER OVERTURNED IT CAUSING THE STATUE TO BREAK IN TWO ABOVE THE BREASTS
THIS WE DID AWHILE
SEE VARCHI AND SEGNI
PRINCE WHEN I UNCOVERED MY HERCULES AND CACUS I VERILY BELIEVE A HUNDRED SONNETS WERE WRITTEN ON ME FULL OF THE WORST ABUSE WHICH COULD BE INVENTED BY THE IGNORANT RABBLE. 1 I REJOINED
A COMEDY OF HIS CALLED COMMODO IS EXTANT
XVII AMONG THE MAGISTRATES WERE SOME RADICAL FELLOWS WITH TURNED-UP HOODS WHO HAD BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE ENTREATIES AND THE CALUMNIES OF MY OPPONENTS BECAUSE THEY ALL BELONGED TO THE PARTY OF FRA GIROLAMO
I TOOK THOSE NEW SHEETS OF MINE WHICH AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY I HAD CUT IN STRIPS AND SEWN TOGETHER
AND SO OUR JOY AT EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER WAS EXTRAVAGANT
1 THIS CAVALIERINO HAD BEEN A GROOM IN THE STABLE OF FILIPPO STROZZI
AND NOW HE BALANCED HIMSELF ABOUT ON ONE FOOT NOW ON THE OTHER
IMMEDIATELY UPON THE RECEIPT OF CARDINAL FERRARAS LETTER I ANSWERED THAT ABOUT CARDINAL DE GADDI I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND THAT EVEN IF HE HAD MADE OVERTURES OF THAT KIND TO ME I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT ITALY WITHOUT INFORMING HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP
THE FEVER FEARED THAT IT MIGHT CATCH IT TOO AS WE DID! ALL MY POOR HOUSEHOLD RELIEVED IN LIKE MEASURE FROM ANXIETY AND OVERWHELMING LABOUR WENT AT ONCE TO BUY EARTHEN VESSELS IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE PEWTER I HAD CAST AWAY
THIS I TOOK TO MADONNA PORZIA WHOM I FOUND WITH THE SAME ROMAN LADY
CXI HAVING QUITE COMPLETED MY CRUCIFIX I THOUGHT THAT IF I RAISED IT SOME FEET ABOVE THE GROUND IT WOULD SHOW BETTER THAN IT DID UPON A LOWER LEVEL
INDEED I COULD EXCUSE MYSELF BY SAYING THAT LIKE A FAITHFUL SERVANT I HAD KEPT BACK TREASURE TO THAT AMOUNT FOR THE SACRED AND HOLY APOSTOLIC CHURCH WAITING TILL I COULD RESTORE IT TO A GOOD POPE OR ELSE TO THOSE WHO MIGHT REQUIRE IT OF ME
BUT HE STRAIGHTWAY RELAPSED INTO THE SAME DELIRIOUS RAVINGS AS BEFORE POURING FORTH A TORRENT OF THE MOST TERRIBLE FRENZIES AND HORRIBLE IMPRECATIONS THAT THE MIND OF MAN COULD IMAGINE
GREGORIO MAGALOTTI WAS A ROMAN
NIGHT CAME THE ENEMY HAD ENTERED ROME AND WE WHO WERE IN THE CASTLE ESPECIALLY MYSELF WHO HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN PLEASURE IN EXTRAORDINARY SIGHTS STAYED GAZING ON THE INDESCRIBABLE SCENE OF TUMULT AND CONFLAGRATION IN THE STREETS BELOW
INCENSED BY THESE PRESUMPTUOUS WORDS WHICH WERE NONE OF MY SAYING THE KING EXCLAIMED
THE OFFICIALS WHO RECEIVED THESE ORDERS WERE CERTAIN CLERKS OF THE CAMERA WHO MADE THE PROPER SEARCH AS WAS THEIR DUTY AND SOON FOUND THE ROGUE
IT IS ONLY REASONABLE THAT I SHOULD SINCE THAT WAS THE FIRST I EVER MADE
FRIEND BENVENUTO HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD IT SAID THAT WHEN THE POOR GIVE TO THE RICH THE DEVIL LAUGHS? I REPLIED
THE OTHERS UNANIMOUSLY EXPRESSED SORROW TO ME THAT FEDERIGO DE RICCI PREVENTED THEM FROM DESPATCHING THE AFFAIR
1 I HAD THEREFORE MUCH TROUBLE TO DEFEND MY POOR LIFE
ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO ONE OF THE BEST ARCHITECTS OF THE LATER RENAISSANCE
IN QUESTO MONDO TI SGONFIERó A OGNI MODO NOTE 3
AH YOU SLANDEROUS TONGUE
SIGNOR PIER LUIGIS WIFE WHO WAS CALLED SIGNORA JEROLIMA BETOOK HERSELF TO THE POPE AND THREW HERSELF UPON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL CARDINALS
4 HIS NAME WAS SOLOSMEO AND HE GAVE ME THE NEWS THAT ON THE VERY EVENING OF THE FRAY POPE CLEMENT SENT ONE OF HIS CHAMBERLAINS TO INQUIRE HOW TOBBIA WAS GETTING ON
AH WOE IS ME
POEMS OF THIS KIND MOSTLY BURLESQUE OR SATIRICAL WERE VERY POPULAR IN CELLINIS AGE
MOREOVER HE HAS DISPLAYED SUCH AUDACITY BLENT WITH SO MUCH INGENUITY THAT HIS EXPLOIT MIGHT SEEM SUPERHUMAN
O BENVENUTO THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WERE JUST NOW DEMONSTRATING WITH SO MANY EXCELLENT ARGUMENTS
AND I HAD TWO YOUNG ROMANS FOR MY COMPANIONS ONE OF THEM A CRAFTSMAN IN MY TRADE THE OTHER ONLY A COMRADE IN OUR JOURNEY
BUT WHILE DRINKING DEEP OF THIS DELIGHT IT OCCURRED TO MY MIND HOW EXACTLY ON THAT DAY THE MONTH EXPIRED WHICH HAD BEEN PROPHESIED WITHIN THE NECROMANTIC CIRCLE BY THE DEVILS
ONLY TOO HAPPY I TO HAVE THAT MISERABLE POST OF MACE-BEARER
BUT IN A MOMENT I RECOVERED PRESENCE OF MIND ENOUGH TO TURN IT OFF WITH A JEST
IN SHORT HE WISHED ME TO BE PREPARED AND THEREFORE HE HAD SPOKEN
LEFT HIM EVERYTHING I POSSESSED
2 PRESENTING HIMSELF BEFORE THEM BOTH HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
ON THE DAY WHEN HE REACHED HOME I HAPPENED TO BE ABSENT
THE WHOLE WORLD BEING DARKENED OVER WITH PLAGUE AND WAR I HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN REACHING MANTUA
AND SOMETIMES A SINGLE RING BROUGHT ME MORE THAN FORTY CROWNS MERELY IN PAYMENT FOR MY LABOUR
FOR I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE PREDICTED WRONGLY OF THEIR WORK AND THEY MADE AS THOUGH THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ABOUT MINE
THERE
THAT AMUSEMENT HOWEVER LED ME TO EXPOSE MYSELF TO WIND AND WATER AND TO STAYING OUT IN MARSH-LANDS
AT THAT TIME I MADE FOR HIM THIS VASE AND ONE OF A DIFFERENT PATTERN
IT SHALL AND MUST BE SO AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT IT. THE MAN DEPARTED AND HAD ME LOCKED IN
AFTER THIS I WENT ON WORKING AT MY JUPITER IN SILVER AND ALSO AT THE GREAT VASE I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WHICH WAS RICHLY DECORATED WITH A VARIETY OF ORNAMENTS AND FIGURES
CELLINI THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HAVE HIS THROAT CUT
INDEED I HOPE THAT TIME WILL BE LEFT ME TO PRODUCE FAR GREATER THINGS THAN THIS. THE CARDINAL REPLIED IN HEAT
THEN I RESUMED MY WORK AND PUSHED IT FORWARD AS BRISKLY AS I COULD
HOWEVER IT PLEASED GOD THAT I REACHED IT AFTER NIGHTFALL WITH GREAT TOIL AND IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO MY FARM WHERE I WENT TO BED
AND JUST THEN THE HUSBAND OF MY SISTER SICKENED AND DIED AFTER A FEW DAYS ILLNESS
NOW MESSER DURANTE ENTRUSTED A DIAMOND OF TRIFLING VALUE TO ONE OF THE GUARDS
ARRIVED IN NOVEMBER FROM TUNIS
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT HE PLACED SOME OF MY DESIGNS IN THE HANDS OF DIVERS PERSONS AT VENICE AND ELSEWHERE AND WAS VERY ILL SERVED BY THEM
ACCORDINGLY I SET AT WORK ON SEVERAL MODELS AND BESTOWED IMMENSE PAINS ON THEM
THE SPIRITS
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE FIGURE CAME OUT SPLENDIDLY AND WAS AS FINE A SPECIMEN OF FOUNDRY AS HAD EVER BEEN SEEN
FRIEND BENVENUTO I BEAR YOU AS GREAT LOVE AS I HAVE IT IN MY HEART TO GIVE
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE INVISIBLE BEING WHO HAD DIVERTED ME FROM MY INTENTION OF SUICIDE CAME TO ME BEING STILL INVISIBLE BUT WITH A CLEAR VOICE AND SHOOK ME AND MADE ME RISE AND SAID TO ME
XXVIII WELL THEN TO RETURN TO MY AFFAIRS
YOU SHALL NEVER WANT MY FAVOUR. UPON THIS HE TOLD HIS FIRST SECRETARY MONSIGNOR DI VILLEROIS TO SEE ME PROVIDED AND ACCOMMODATED WITH ALL I NEEDED
I ENTREAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO ALLOW ME EIGHT DAYS FIRST TO GO AND RETURN THANKS TO GOD
HE WANTED THEM TO REPRESENT SIX GODS AND SIX GODDESSES AND TO HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME HEIGHT AS HIS MAJESTY WHICH WAS A TRIFLE UNDER FOUR CUBITS
THEY KEPT ASKING HIM IF HE HAD BEEN AFRAID
I HAD A DOG BLACK AS A MULBERRY ONE OF THOSE HAIRY ONES WHO FOLLOWED ME ADMIRABLY WHEN I WENT OUT SHOOTING AND NEVER LEFT MY SIDE
BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO LIES IN DUNGEON DARK LANGUISHING MANY A MONTH THEN TAKES HIS FLIGHT OF WAR TRUCE PEACE HE KNOWS AND TELLS THE MARK
AND THE KING DEPARTED SOONER THAN HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE CALLING ALOUD HOWEVER TO ENCOURAGE ME
GO AND TELL HIM TO REVEAL HIS ACCOMPLICE WITHOUT APPREHENSION TO YOU BE THE MAN WHO HE MAY BE SINCE I HAVE PARDONED HIM
HOWEVER THE SIGHT OF MY PHYSICAL PAIN AND MORAL DEJECTION SO AFFECTED HER THAT IN SPITE OF THAT BRAVE HEART OF HERS SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SHEDDING TEARS
THIS I BAKED WELL AND THEN BEGAN TO SPREAD ON THE WAX SURFACE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE FIGURE TO MY LIKING
THEY CAME IN FACT TO CALLING ME UNGRATEFUL LIGHT AND DISLOYAL
BUT WHEN HE INFORMED HER SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD NOT GO AND BEGGED HIM AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR NOT TO GO HIMSELF THAT DAY
THIS STRUCK HER WITH SUCH FORCE THAT SHE RAISED A CRY OF INDESCRIBABLE ASTONISHMENT AND TURNING TO THE DUKE EXCLAIMED
THE DUKE ORDERED US TO TELL YOU UNDER PAIN OF HIS DISPLEASURE THAT YOU ARE TO VALUE THE STATUE AND YOU MAY HAVE TWO OR THREE DAYS TO CONSIDER YOUR ESTIMATE
THESE THREATS WERE SO FAR FROM TERRIFYING ME THAT I SENT HIM WORD I WAS GOING IMMEDIATELY TO LAY MY CASE BEFORE THE POPE
THE BARGELLO WAS THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OR SHERIFF IN ITALIAN TOWNS
THEN ON THE FIRST OF AUGUST WE WENT TO THE BELVEDERE AND WHILE POPE CLEMENT WAS AT TABLE WE PLAYED THOSE CAREFULLY STUDIED MOTETS SO WELL THAT HIS HOLINESS PROTESTED HE HAD NEVER HEARD MUSIC MORE SWEETLY EXECUTED OR WITH BETTER HARMONY OF PARTS
CELLINI SAYS SUMMAM NOTE 4
ONLY TO THINK THAT A FELLOW FROM PRATO OUR HEREDITARY FOEMAN THE SON OF A COOPER AND THE MOST IGNORANT CREATURE IN EXISTENCE SHOULD HAVE RISEN TO SUCH A STATION OF INFLUENCE MERELY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN THE ROTTEN TUTOR OF COSIMO DE MEDICI BEFORE HE BECAME DUKE
IT DESCRIBES THE PROCESS HE NOW EMPLOYED IN PREPARING A MOULD FOR BRONZE-CASTING
AND THE NEXT DAY FOLLOWING HE BETOOK HIMSELF AWAY FROM ROME
FOR HAVING TAKEN THE KING AT A MOMENT OF AMOROUS WEAKNESS TO WHICH HE WAS MUCH SUBJECT SHE WHEEDLED HIM INTO CONCEDING WHAT SHE WANTED
AND WHEN WE STEPPED INTO THE STREET TOGETHER I TOLD HIM I WAS QUITE READY TO TAKE VENGEANCE FOR THE INSULTS HEAPED ON HIM BY THAT SCOUNDREL PROVIDED HE PERMIT ME TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO THE ART OF DESIGN
NEVERTHELESS I FELT CONVINCED THAT WHEN MY PERSEUS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THESE TRIALS WOULD BE TURNED TO HIGH FELICITY AND GLORIOUS WELL-BEING
BATTLING THUS WITH ALL THESE UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND EXERTING MYSELF BEYOND EVEN THE MEASURE OF MY POWERFUL CONSTITUTION I COULD AT LAST BEAR UP NO LONGER AND A SUDDEN FEVER 3 OF THE UTMOST POSSIBLE INTENSITY ATTACKED ME
FIRST I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH SEVERAL LOADS OF PINEWOOD FROM THE FORESTS OF SERRISTORI IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MONTELUPO
HE PRODUCED THE BRONZE STATUTE OF POPE JULIUS III WHICH MAY STILL BE SEEN IN HIS NATIVE CITY
HOW FAR GREATER IS THE GRACE WHICH THOU ART GRANTING ME THAN THAT WHICH I EXPECTED! THE SUN WITHOUT HIS RAYS APPEARED TO ME TO BE A BATH OF THE PUREST MOLTEN GOLD NEITHER MORE NOR LESS
I BROUGHT BACK WITH ME INTO ITALY NOTHING BUT SOME MARKS OF FAVOUR AND MOST ROYAL PROMISES TRULY WORTHY OF HIS MAJESTY
AT THE SIDES I INTRODUCED PROJECTIONS WITH SOCLES AND CORNICES PROPERLY CORRESPONDING
IT MIGHT EVEN COME INTO HIS HEAD IMAGINING THAT HE HAD BEEN WRONGLY IMPRISONED TO FIRE UPON YOUR HOLINESS
AFTER WHICH I SPENT PART OF MY TIME IN LEARNING THAT ART AND PART IN PLAYING MUCH AGAINST MY WILL
BENVENUTO I AM VERY SORRY THAT YOU ARE SO BLIND TO YOUR OWN INTEREST
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU
BUT OUR ANIMALS WERE NOT UP TO THE BUSINESS AND WE BURST WITH THE FATIGUE OF MAKING THEM ASCEND THAT HILL OF DIFFICULTY
I ASKED IF HE WOULD LET US HAVE THE BOAT TO OURSELVES
2 THERE WE PRESENTED OURSELVES TO THE CARDINAL WHO PROVIDED US AT ONCE WITH LODGINGS AND THAT EVENING WE WERE COMFORTABLE
IT HAPPENED UPON ONE OF THOSE DAYS THAT HIS EXCELLENCY CAME AS USUAL TO THE ROOM WHERE I WAS OCCUPIED AND MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE HEARD OF MY ARRIVAL
HE GOVERNED NAPLES FOR TWENTY YEARS FROM 1532 ONWARDS
HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEFORE ME ABOUT MIDNIGHT
HIS RIGHT LEG WAS BROKEN SHORT OFF IN THE THIGH
SO I RETURNED IN BAD SPIRITS TO FLORENCE
IN THE HANDS OF BANDINELLO IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE COME TO GRIEF
YOU WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE CURED OF THAT WEAKNESS
IT SO HAPPENED THAT I HAD BEEN AT WORK ONE MORNING MORE THAN THREE HOURS BEFORE DAYBREAK UPON THE TROUSSEAU OF THE BRIDE I MENTIONED
THIS FELLOW IS NO MAN OF BRONZE OR MARBLE BUT OF PURE IRON. THEN HE GAVE ONE OF HIS MEANINGLESS LAUGHS AND PUTTING HIS FINGERS ON MY WRIST SAID
WELL AS I HAVE SAID HE KEPT EVER ON THE WATCH TO SERVE ME SOME ILL TURN
LATINO GIOVENALE DE MANETTI WAS A LATIN POET AND A MAN OF HUMANE LEARNING MUCH ESTEEMED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
NOW HIS EXCELLENCY HAD ALREADY SEEN BANDINELLOS DESIGNS AND THOSE OF OTHER SCULPTORS
THE TRANSLATOR HAS TO COLLECT THE WHOLE SENSE OF THE PASSAGE
LET HIM JUDGE BETWEEN US WHO STANDS BY AND HAS NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN OUR ADVENTURES
I SPOKE LONG UPON THESE TOPICS AND WITH THE GREATER PLEASURE BECAUSE I SAW THAT HIS EXCELLENCY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED
JESUS! THAT JESUS WOULD HELP HIM IF HE HELPED HIMSELF
FOR I MUST SAY THAT A THIEF UNDER THE PRETEXT OF BEING A GOLDSMITH HAD SPIED ON ME AND CAST HIS EYES UPON THE PRECIOUS STONES AND MADE A PLAN TO STEAL THEM
I TOLD HIM THAT AS SOON AS HIS ORDERS WERE CARRIED INTO EFFECT I WOULD WORK FOR HIS MAJESTY WITHOUT OTHER SALARY OR RECOMPENSE OF ANY KIND UNTIL OLD AGE DEPRIVED ME OF THE POWER TO LABOUR WHEN I HOPED TO REST MY TIRED BODY IN PEACE MAINTAINING MYSELF WITH HONOUR ON THAT INCOME AND ALWAYS BEARING IN MIND THAT I HAD SERVED SO GREAT A MONARCH AS HIS MAJESTY
SUPPOSING ANOTHER OF THESE STORMS SHOULD RISE AND THE MAN SHOULD LOSE CONFIDENCE IN ME I SHOULD THEN BE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO HIM AND MIGHT WISH TO USE MY WITS A LITTLE WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY WORK THEIR END BETTER THAN THOSE OF THAT RASCALLY FRIAR. SO I BEGAN TO HAVE NEW SHEETS OF A COARSE FABRIC BROUGHT ME AND DID NOT SEND THE DIRTY ONES AWAY
AND THUS THE AFFAIR ENDED
AT THE SAME TIME I RECOMMENCED THE JUG WHICH WAS DESIGNED WITH ROUND FIGURES AND BAS-RELIEFS
SO NOW WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD EMERGED FROM THIS TEMPESTUOUS SEA OF TROUBLES AND HOPED MY EVIL STAR WOULD LEAVE ME QUIET FOR A MOMENT IT BEGAN TO SET TWO SCHEMES IN MOTION AGAINST ME BEFORE I HAD RECOVERED MY BREATH FROM THAT GREAT STRUGGLE
WHILE DIGGING THE GROUND THEY FREQUENTLY TURNED UP ANTIQUE MEDALS AGATES CHRYSOPRASES CORNELIANS AND CAMEOS
THIS SALT-CELLAR IS NOW AT VIENNA
I MUST ADD THAT THEY PROFESSED THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY THE SAME RENT OF SEVENTY CROWNS AS DURING THE FIVE YEARS PAST WHILE I REPLIED THAT I WOULD NOT TAKE A FARTHING LESS
HE HAD SMALL ACQUIREMENTS IN OUR ART BUT WAS AN EXCELLENT AND COURAGEOUS SWORDSMAN
ACCORDINGLY NO SOONER DID I PRESENT MYSELF THAN THESE FELLOWS LEFT THEIR DOORS AND BADE ME BEGONE
GIOVANNI GADDI OF THE FLORENTINE FAMILY WAS PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO MEN OF ART AND LETTERS
IT IS GOD WHO HAS HELPED US TO GET BACK INTO SO HONOURED A GO-CART! ON THE DAY FOLLOWING I WENT TO THANK THE KING WHO ORDERED ME TO MAKE THE MODELS OF TWELVE SILVER STATUES WHICH WERE TO STAND AS CANDELABRA ROUND HIS TABLE
2 AND THIRDLY THE JUDGE IN CRIMINAL CASES MESSER BENEDETTO DA CAGLI
HE ANSWERED IN A LIKE TONE OF POLITENESS
NOW I STAYED THERE SEVERAL DAYS AND WENT OUT RIDING DAILY WITH HIS EXCELLENCY
HE TELLS THAT I SHALL LIVE AND YOU MUST DIE! I SANG AND WROTE MY HARD CASE HEAD BY HEAD ASKING FROM GOD PARDON AND AID IN NEED FOR NOW IF FELT MINE EYES OUTWORN AND DEAD
1 AT THAT TIME THERE ARRIVED IN FLORENCE A SIENESE CALLED GIROLAMO MARRETTI WHO HAD LIVED LONG IN TURKEY AND WAS A MAN OF LIVELY INTELLECT
IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU! I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST FRIEND OF TRUTH AND FOE OF LIES
THIS ROUSED UP ALL MY ENEMIES WHO BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD HINDER ME
AND THE MILITIA BEING ORGANISED IN EACH QUARTER OF THE TOWN I TOO RECEIVED ORDERS TO SERVE IN MY TURN
AND WERE IT NOT FOR SOME OF THOSE TRIFLING DEFECTS YOU SPEAK OF THE ROPE WOULD BE WORTH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND. TO THIS I REPLIED THAT EVEN WERE THE NECKLACE OF QUITE FLAWLESS QUALITY I COULD NOT ADVISE ANY ONE TO BID UP TO FIVE THOUSAND CROWNS FOR IT
SO I BEGAN TO TRY THE NAILS WHICH KEPT THE HINGES OF MY DOOR IN PLACE
AND I WENT TO LODGE IN HIS HOUSE WITH THREE HORSES AND THREE SERVANTS AT SO MUCH PER WEEK
MISFORTUNES CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ESPECIALLY TO MEN OF CHOLERIC HUMOUR WHEN THEY ARE IN THE RIGHT EVEN AS IT HAPPENED TO MY SON
BE USED WITH FORCE HOPELESS OF HELP BY BRUTAL FOES AND STRONG
AS I WAS SAYING OUR FORMER ACQUAINTANCE LED HIM TO TAKE ME BY THE HAND AND BRING ME TO HIS DWELLING WHERE I FOUND THE PRIOR DEGLI STROZZI BROTHER OF MY LORD PEIRO
SO TELL ME MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY WHETHER YOU WISH ME NOT TO COME HERE ANY MORE
COGNOBBI THE SUBJECT TO THIS VERB MAY BE EITHER CELLINI OR THE DOCTOR
THIS FURNACE CALLED MANICA WAS LIKE A GRAIN-HOPPER SO THAT THE MOULD COULD STAND UPRIGHT IN IT AS IN A CUP
NOW IT IS THE CUSTOM FOR THOSE WHO GET A PARDON UPON THIS OCCASION TO GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO PRISON
SANTINI WHO WAS SEATED OPPOSITE ME AT TABLE EXCLAIMED
CATERINA
I ANSWERED THAT I SHOULD BE MAD TO REPLY OTHERWISE-MAD IF I BASED MY HOPES ON SUCH PROMISES BEING CERTAIN TO GET NOTHING
THEY HAVE INDEED THEIR FATHER BUT HE IS VERY OLD AND GAINS NOTHING BY HIS TRADE
1 TO HIM THEREFORE HE NOW WROTE CLAIMING ME FROM THE POPE AS THE MAN OF HIS MAJESTY
WHEN WE REACHED LYONS I WAS ALREADY ILL AND MY LAD ASCANIO HAD TAKEN A QUARTAN FEVER
AND I BEING ANGRY WITH MY FATHER FOR THE SAME OLD REASON OF THE MUSIC SAID TO TASSO
THE DIFFICULTY OF EXECUTING IT IS APPARENT ONLY TO THE EYES OF SUCH AS ARE PAST-MASTERS IN THESE CRAFTS
UNA FEBBRE EFIMERA LIT A FEVER OF ONE DAYS DURATION NOTE 4
XXIV FAR BACK IN MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY I OUGHT TO HAVE RECORDED THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH I WON WITH THE MOST CULTIVATED THE MOST AFFECTIONATE AND THE MOST COMPANIONABLE MAN OF WORTH I EVER KNEW IN THIS WORLD
SUCH A DEMAND WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST HONOURABLE MARKS OF FAVOUR WHICH A MAN OF MY SORT COULD DESIRE
INSTEAD OF THE GRIEVE WHICH IS NOT A NAVIGABLE STREAM IT APPEARS THAT CELLINI OUGHT TO HAVE WRITTEN THE OMBRONE
HE HAD TRUSSED HIS SWORD IN FRONT 2 FOR SWAGGER AFTER A WAY THOSE SPANIARDS HAVE
BUT NOW THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE SINCE THE EMPEROR WAS EXPECTED IN ROME IN ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF
FOR SINCE I HAD GIVEN THEM SUCH PERFECT SATISFACTION THEY WISHED TO DO THE LIKE BY ME
FROM WHAT I HEARD HIS EXCELLENCY HAD BEEN TALKING OF ME THAT MORNING COMMENDING ME HIGHLY AND IN PARTICULAR PRAISING MY SKILL IN SETTING JEWELS
THEREFORE HE THOUGHT SIXTEEN THOUSAND CROWNS OR MORE WOULD NOT BE AN EXCESSIVE PRICE FOR IT
THIS SPEECH TOO CAME TO POPE CLEMENTS EARS AND MADE HIM LAUGH HEARTILY
WHILE THE OTHERS STRAP BENVENUTO ON THIS CHAIR
THE VENUS NEITHER THE MEDICEAN NOR THE CAPITOLINE REPRESENTS THE GODDESS ISSUING FROM THE BATH
IN THOSE CONSISTS THE REAL DISTINCTION OF THIS ART AND NOT IN THAT MODERN TRUMPERY. THEN THE KING ADVANCED AND THE OTHERS WITH HIM
NOW WHETHER THE DUKE KNEW THAT I HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH OR WHETHER HE WANTED TO HAVE HIS OWN WAY A LONG TIME PASSED BEFORE I HEARD ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT
ONE AMONG THE REST IS WORTHY OF MENTION
WHEN THE SERVANTS ENTERED THE DOG FLEW AT THEM AND TRIED TO BITE THEM
HER NAME WAS COSA
NAY PRITHEE BENVENUTO COME WITH ME AND SHUN A GREAT DISASTER WHICH I SEE IMPENDING OVER YOU. HOWEVER I HAD MADE MY MIND UP COME WHAT WOULD TO FINISH MY MEDAL AND WE WERE NOW APPROACHING THE END OF THE MONTH
IN GRATITUDE FOR THIS AND ALL OTHER MARVELLOUS MERCIES I SHOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL EIGHT DAYS ON PILGRIMAGE CONTINUALLY THANKING MY IMMORTAL GOD WHO NEVER FAILS TO HELP THOSE WHO CALL UPON HIM WITH SINCERITY. THE DUKE THEN ASKED ME WHERE I WISHED TO GO
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THAT POOR MAN IF HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF IN MY HANDS
I AM VERY SORRY TO HEAR OF HIS BAD ACCIDENT
EXCELLENT AND VIRTUOUS FATHERS AND MASTERS OF LIKE QUALITY OUGHT NOT TO LET THEIR ARM IN WRATH DESCEND UPON THEIR SONS AND SERVANTS WITH SUCH INCONSIDERATE HASTE SEEING THAT SUBSEQUENT REPENTANCE WILL AVAIL THEM NOTHING
AFTERWARDS HE CAME TO THE PALACE WHERE HE MET WITH CARDINAL CORNARO WHO TOLD HIM EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW I WAS LODGED IN ONE OF HIS OWN CHAMBERS AND ALREADY IN THE DOCTORS HANDS
THE CARDINAL WAS SO PROUD OF IT THAT HE USED TO COMPARE IT COMPLACENTLY WITH THE OTHER SEALS OF THE ROMAN CARDINALS WHICH WERE NEARLY ALL FROM THE HAND OF LAUTIZIO
FOR WHEN ANTONIO LANDI WAS WILLING TO LET IT GO AT THAT PRICE HOW THE DEVIL CAN BERNARDONE HAVE PLAYED OFF SUCH A SHAMEFUL TRICK UPON HIS EXCELLENCY
XLII POPE CLEMENT HAD NOW DECLARED WAR UPON THE CITY OF FLORENCE WHICH THEREUPON WAS PUT IN A STATE OF DEFENCE
IF YOU SEND FOR THIS GREAT ARTIST TO ROME YOUR HOLINESS WILL BRING DOWN THE OVERWEENING ARROGANCE OF YOUR FAVOURITE BENVENUTO AND I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT TOBBIAS WORK WILL PLEASE YOU FAR MORE THAN HIS. THE POPE ACCORDINGLY SENT FOR HIM AT ONCE
I FELT COMPELLED TO COMPLAIN PRETTY SHARPLY TO HIS EXCELLENCY
WE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE MY GOSSIP TRIBOLO SAID THAT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND SOME LITTLE STRAPS BELONGING TO HIS CARPET-BAG AND THAT HE MUST BE ALLOWED TO GO BACK FOR THEM
BUT THE FRENCH PRONOUNCE IT SO THAT THEY USUALLY MADE IT SOUND LIKE MONSIGNORE ASINO BUE
AND I KNOW THAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY REMEMBERS THE FACT VERY WELL
BEING INFORMED OF WHAT HAD PASSED I WAITED FIFTEEN DAYS DURING WHICH THEY MADE A TOUR THROUGH NORMANDY VISITING ROUEN AND DIEPPE
AFTER NIGHTFALL THERE APPEARED NICCOLò BENINTENDI AND HIS BROTHER PIERO AND ANOTHER OLD MAN WHOM I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN JACOPO NARDI 5 TOGETHER WITH SOME YOUNG FELLOWS WHO BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO ASK THE COURIER NEWS EACH MAN OF HIS OWN FAMILY IN FLORENCE
THE CAPORIONI OF ROME WERE LIKE ALDERMEN WARDENS OF THE DISTRICTS INTO WHICH THE CITY WAS DIVIDED
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT DURING THESE MANY YEARS PAST I HAVE BEEN PROGRESSING IN MY ART WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND I THINK THAT THE VASE I AM TAKING WITH ME INTO FRANCE IS FAR MORE WORTHY OF CARDINALS AND KINGS THAN THAT PIECE BELONGING TO YOUR LITTLE QUACK DOCTOR. AFTER I HAD MADE THIS SPEECH MESSER ALFONSO SEEMED DYING WITH DESIRE TO SEE THE JUG AND BASIN BUT I REFUSED TO OPEN THE BOX
NICCOLò RIDOLFI WAS A NEPHEW OF LEO X
ONLY I REQUEST YOU TO PUT ONE OF YOUR HORSES AT MY DISPOSITION. THEY HAD ALREADY SADDLED A BLACK TURKISH HORSE THE FINEST AND THE BEST IN ROME
FOR HAD I NOT STOOD IN THAT AUGUST PRESENCE I SHOULD HAVE FELLED HIM DEAD TO EARTH
ASSURE YOUR CONFESSOR OF THIS IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE UPON YOUR CONSCIENCE WHICH CONCERNS ME
SO I RETURNED TO MY BUSINESS
1 IF IT IS TRUE THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM HIS EYES OF WHICH I SHALL GET INFORMATION THROUGH MY DOCTOR ONE OUGHT TO MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR HIM. A GREAT GENTLEMAN INTIMATE WITH THE POPE AND A MAN OF VERY DISTINGUISHED PARTS HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT
WE MEANWHILE ARRIVED AT STAGGIA WHERE WE WERE IN SAFETY
ALL THE WHILE AT TABLE SANSOVINO HAD NEVER STOPPED CHATTERING ABOUT HIS GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS ABUSING MICHEL AGNOLO AND THE REST OF HIS FELLOW-SCULPTORS WHILE HE BRAGGED AND VAUNTED HIMSELF TO THE SKIES
I COULD NOT FORM THE LEAST IDEA WHY THE BEAST BEHAVED IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY MANNER TO ME
NOT CARING TO BE TROUBLED WITH A CROWD OF PEOPLE HE LIKED ME TO CONVERSE WITH HIM
AFTER LISTENING TO MY STORY HE ANSWERED THAT HE HAD HEARD AS MUCH AND THAT I SPOKE THE TRUTH
I MADE NO ANSWER TO THESE WORDS AND DEPARTED THE NEXT DAY AS SECRETLY AS I WAS ABLE TURNING MY FACE AGAIN TOWARDS FLORENCE
MESSER RUBERTO PUCCI THE FATHER OF MESSER PANDOLFO 1 HAVING HEARD OF THE GREAT EVENT WENT IN PERSON TO INSPECT THE PLACE
THE VASE WAS FAR ADVANCED
AH WOE IS ME
AH WOE IS ME
THESE HOWEVER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GEMS ARE OBJECTS OF LITTLE ARTISTIC INTEREST
HE HAD SENT A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN OF HIS NAMED MONSIGNOR DI MORLUC AS HIS AMBASSADOR TO ROME
6 HAVING GOT INTO THE CASTLE IN THIS WAY I ATTACHED MYSELF TO CERTAIN PIECES OF ARTILLERY WHICH WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF A BOMBARDIER CALLED GIULIANO FIORENTINO
THEN HIS EXCELLENCY TOLD ME THAT HE SHOULD LIKE ME FIRST TO EXECUTE THE DIE OF HIS PORTRAIT IN FINE STYLE AS I HAD DONE FOR POPE CLEMENT
THE NEPTUNE ON THE PIAZZA AT BOLOGNA WHICH IS HIS WORK MAY PROBABLY HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FROM THE MODEL HE MADE IN COMPETITION UPON THIS OCCASION
MEANWHILE I ABODE IN EXTREME DISCOMFORT AND MY HEART KEPT THUMPING AGAINST MY RIBS
FOR THAT WHILE I WANTED TO MAKE THE DEVIL LAUGH SHE HAD MADE HIM ONCE MORE DENY GOD
CORRESPONDING TO THESE AT THE BASE OF THE CUP WERE THREE CIRCULAR HISTORIES IN BAS-RELIEF
AFFUSOLATO LIT STRAIGHT AS A SPINDLE
ON SEEING THAT IT COULD NOT BE HELPED I TOLD HIM BEFORE ALL HIS SERVANTS
OTHERWISE HIS LORDSHIP MIGHT DISPOSE OF ME EXACTLY AS HE THOUGHT BEST
ACCORDINGLY I SENT FOR ALL MY PEWTER PLATTERS PORRINGERS AND DISHES TO THE NUMBER OF SOME TWO HUNDRED PIECES AND HAD A PORTION OF THEM CAST ONE BY ONE INTO THE CHANNELS THE REST INTO THE FURNACE
STILL EXISTS IN THE LADY CHAPEL OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY
THE LEADERS IN THESE EVENTS APPEAR IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PICTURE ONLY WHEN THEY COME INTO PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH THE HERO
XCV I CHOSE THE ROUTE THROUGH THE GRISONS ALL OTHER PASSES BEING UNSAFE ON ACCOUNT OF WAR
AND WHAT I AM DOING TO HER HUSBAND IS SOMETHING FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN WHAT HE DID TO ME WHEN SHE WAS ONLY A GIRL OF LOOSE LIFE
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PERCEIVE WHICH OF US IS EAGER TO EXCEL IN THE GRAND STYLE OF OUR NOBLE CALLING AND WILL SHOW YOURSELVES PRINCES WHO ENJOY AND UNDERSTAND THE FINE ARTS. THE DUCHESS IN A GREAT RAGE TOLD ME THAT I TIRED HER PATIENCE OUT
AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THAT FASTENING OF POPE CLEMENTS COPE ON WHICH I HAD WROUGHT SO MANY WONDERFUL FIGURES
AS I DID NOT KNOW WHICH GATE WOULD START ME ON THE ROAD TO ROME I ARRIVED AT LUCCA AND FROM LUCCA REACHED PISA
I HAD HEARD HIM MENTIONED AS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND ABLE IN HIS PROFESSION BUT I DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD FORFEITED THAT REPUTATION BY HIS ROGUERIES
I WILL NOT HOWEVER SET MYSELF TO DESCRIBE THAT TRAGEDY BUT WILL CONTENT MYSELF WITH CONTINUING THE HISTORY OF MY OWN LIFE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH PROPERLY BELONG TO IT
PERCHANCE IN RECOMPENSE FOR MANY BENEFITS CONFERRED ON HIM
CVIII I THEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE UPON THE BEST WAY OF MAKING MY ESCAPE
I DO NOT KNOW
THIS BEING SO-NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HIS PRICES WERE SO HIGH BUT BECAUSE HE WORKED SO SLOWLY-I BEGAN TO BE EMPLOYED BY CERTAIN NOBLEMEN FOR WHOM AMONG OTHER THINGS I MADE A MEDAL IN COMPETITION WITH THAT GREAT ARTIST AND IT HAD FOUR FIGURES UPON WHICH I HAD EXPENDED AN INFINITY OF LABOUR
THEN I DEPARTED IN MY EVIL HOUR TOGETHER WITH SIGNOR IPPOLITO GONZAGA AT THAT TIME IN THE PAY OF THE KING AND ALSO IN THE SERVICE OF COUNT GALEOTTO DELLA MIRANDOLA
WHEN THE LATTER OBTAINED IT HE NEGLECTED HIS ART AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO SCRATCHING HIS PAUNCH, AS CELLINI PREDICTED
4 THIS WAS THE REASON WHY I COMMENCED GOLDSMITH
WHEN THEY HAD ASCERTAINED THAT NONE WERE MISSING THEY LEFT ME IN THE CASTLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD MORE ABOUT IT
THESE ARE MATTERS WHICH DESERVE SOME REFLECTION. TO THIS THE POPE REPLIED
FOR A MOMENT OR TWO MARMAGNA STOOD IN DOUBT NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT TO DO BUT RATHER INCLINED TO MISCHIEF AND MUTTERING
THEREFORE I KNOW SURELY THAT I AM FREE AND FORTUNATE AND IN THE GRACE OF GOD
LEAVING THE CASTLE THEN AND HAVING HIS FACE WET WITH TEARS HE CHANCED TO MEET TWO OF MY CHIEF ENEMIES JERONIMO THE PERUGIAN 2 AND A CERTAIN MICHELE GOLDSMITHS BOTH OF THEM
THEN THE OLD WOMAN WHO THOUGHT ME OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE BEGGED FOR A GOWN OF FINE CLOTH FOR HERSELF AS WELL AS OTHER OUTLAYS FOR HER SONS AND A GOOD BIT MORE MONEY THAN I HAD OFFERED
THE SUBJECT I HAD CHOSEN TO DISCOURSE UPON WAS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE IF FULLY TREATED THAT I COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT AT LEAST THREE HOURS
THERE MY DEAR FRIEND ALBERTACCIO DEL BENE MADE ME LEAVE THE INN FOR HIS HOUSE
THEN HE ADDED
NEARLY THE WHOLE OF HIS PREMISES LAY INSIDE THE CASTLE AND HE WAS THE MAN WHO PRINTED MESSER GUIDOS FIRST FINE BOOK ON MEDICINE
THAT IS GUIACUM CALLED BY THE ITALIANS LEGNO SANTO LX IT HAPPENED THAT CARDINAL SALVIATI WHO AS I HAVE RELATED ENTERTAINED AN OLD HOSTILITY AGAINST ME HAD BEEN APPOINTED LEGATE TO PARMA
1 THEY SPOKE SO GENEROUSLY OF MY PERFORMANCE IN THAT FINE STYLE OF HIS WHICH IS MOST EXQUISITE THAT THIS ALONE REPAID ME SOMEWHAT FOR THE PAIN OF MY LONG TROUBLES
AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE FOR HIM EXCEPT AS I HAVE SAID TO BREAK MY PROMISED WORD
THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THIS SUGGESTION AND WENT AT ONCE TO REPORT THE MATTER TO THE DUKE AMONG THEM BEING PIERO SALVIATI
I SAID THAT HAVING RECEIVED SUCH OUTRAGE AND INSULT FROM GHERARDO AND IN MY FURY HAVING ONLY GIVEN HIM A BOX ON THE EAR I DID NOT THINK I DESERVED SUCH A VEHEMENT REPRIMAND
THIS HOUSE IS IN THE VIA DEL ROSAIO ENTERED FROM VIA DELLA PERGOLA NO
I HAD A CROWD OF WORKMEN AND MANY LARGE AFFAIRS ON HAND IN GOLD AND SILVER
AND OFTENTIMES I FOUND HIM NAPPING AFTER DINNER WITH THAT LORENZINO OF HIS WHO AFTERWARDS MURDERED HIM AND NO OTHER COMPANY
HE WAS SENT TO ROME AND IMPRISONED IN A NOISOME DUNGEON OF S
END OF PART ONE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF BENVENUTO CELLINI PART II I I REMAINED FOR SOME TIME IN THE CARDINAL OF FERRARAS PALACE VERY WELL REGARDED IN GENERAL BY EVERYBODY AND MUCH MORE VISITED EVEN THAN I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN
HE HAD NOT INDEED DESIGNED IT FOR HE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT ARCHITECTURE
I HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE SOME ALTERATIONS IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THIS DOOR WHICH WAS WIDE AND LOW IN THEIR VICIOUS FRENCH STYLE
THE MORE MODERATELY I SPOKE THE MORE ARROGANTLY DID THE BRUTE REPLY
BE DRIVEN AT LENGTH TO SOME MAD DESPERATE COURSE
XLVIII WHILE THESE THINGS WERE HAPPENING WE WERE ALL AT TABLE
WE SHALL MEET IN VENICE. SET OUT BETIMES THEN, I SHOUTED FOR I AM COMING AND ANY MAN CAN MEET ME WHERE HE LISTS. IN DUE COURSE WE ARRIVED AT VENICE WHEN I APPLIED TO A BROTHER OF CARDINAL CORNARO BEGGING HIM TO PROCURE FOR ME THE FAVOUR OF BEING ALLOWED TO CARRY ARMS
GOD SAVE YOU GENTLEMEN
BUT YOU MUST ONLY SEND BACK THOSE THREE VASES FOR THE RASCALLY TREASURERS KEEP SHOUTING STOP THIEF! SO THE BISHOP AND MESSER GUIDO SAY THAT YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY SEND THEM BACK
OH WHEN WILL THAT MOMENT COME AND QUICKLY? THE CARDINAL BADE ME PUT MYSELF IN READINESS AND ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS I HAD IN ROME
THE DRAUGHTSMEN WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED WERE NOT IN THE JEWELLERS TRADE AND THEREFORE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT GIVING THEIR RIGHT PLACE TO PRECIOUS STONES
2 WHEN THEN I TOOK IT TO THE POPE HE WAS INSATIABLE IN PRAISING ME AND SAID
PROCEEDING AT ONCE TO CASTELLO AND ENTERING THE GARDEN WHERE THE DUKE WAS I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AT A DISTANCE
I EMPLOYED EIGHT WORK-PEOPLE AND WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TOGETHER WITH THEM FOR THE SAKE ALIKE OF HONOUR AND OF GAIN
CHAP
CHAP
CHAP
CHAP
THE CAPTAIN PUT UNDER MY ORDERS ENOUGH MEN TO HELP IN MANAGING MY GUNS AND HAVING SEEN ME PAID IN ADVANCE HE GAVE ME RATIONS OF BREAD AND A LITTLE WINE AND BEGGED ME TO GO FORWARD AS I HAD BEGUN
CALLING TO MY DOG BY HIS NAME BARUCCO AND NOT SEEING HIM IN FRONT OF ME I TURNED ROUND AND NOTICED THAT THE WELL-TRAINED ANIMAL WAS POINTING AT SOME GEESE WHICH HAD SETTLED IN A DITCH
ONE OF THEM RELATED HOW SHE HAD GONE WRONG
1 THE YOUNG MEN MET TOGETHER MORE THAN WAS THEIR WONT AND EVERYWHERE WE HAD BUT ONE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
FOR THE COMPARISON OF THESE ADMIRABLE STATUES DEMONSTRATES THE IMMEASURABLE SUPERIORITY OF HIS WORK IN BEAUTY AND IN ART
1 SHE WAS HIS NATURAL CHILD AND HAD BEEN MARRIED TO DUKE ALESSANDRO
I THEREFORE CONSIDER THAT YOUR MAJESTYS BEST COURSE WILL BE TO PRESENT HIM WITH SOMETHING IN YOUR KINGDOM IF YOU WANT TO KEEP HIM IN YOUR SERVICE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. THE KING BEING REALLY IN WANT OF MONEY APPROVED OF THESE ARGUMENTS
A BASTARD OF HIS WHO STAYED BEHIND IN THE LOGGIA REMOVED THE CLOTHS WITH WHICH I KEPT MY MODEL OF NEPTUNE COVERED UNTIL IT SHOULD BE FINISHED
DURING THE TIME THE SERVANT TOOK TO GO AND RETURN MESSER ALFONSO SAID TO MESSER ALBERTO
JUST THEN LUIGI WITH HIS ARM ROUND PANTASILEAS NECK WAS HEARD CRYING
ALAS
ON WHICH THEY TOLD HIM
XXXVIII BY LABOURING INCESSANTLY I HAD NOW GOT MY VARIOUS WORKS WELL FORWARD
WELL WHEN I HAD PRAISED THE PEARLS A THOUSANDFOLD MORE WARMLY THAN I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE THE DUKE TURNED TOWARDS ME WITH A KINDLY LOOK AND SAID
THE DUKE RESPONDED ON THE MOMENT
THE INSANE PASSION WHICH TOOK POSSESSION OF ME MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY DEATH HAD I NOT RESOLVED TO GIVE IT VENT AS THE OCCASION OFFERED
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE DUKE CAME TO SEE IT BRINGING WITH HIM TWO AMBASSADORS ONE FROM THE DUKE OF FERRARA THE OTHER FROM THE SIGNORY OF LUCCA
5 THESE WORDS FLOUT NOT HER WORSHIPPED SANCTITY NOR THOSE HER LILIES GLORIOUS HOLY PURE THE WHICH ILLUMINE EARTH AND HEAVEN HIGH
I WANT BENVENUTO YOU WANT THE BISHOPRIC
BUT IT ANNOYED ME TO NOTICE THAT IT WAS PLACED IN A BAD LIGHT
I FELT SURE THAT THE DUKE HAD NOT MEANT TO ACCOMPANY SUCH MAGNIFICENT COMPLIMENTS WITH SO TRIFLING A GIFT BUT THAT HE MUST HAVE INTENDED TO REWARD ME HANDSOMELY
COULD THE PASTOR OF CHRISTS FLOCK IN RUTH BELIEVE HOW GOD THIS SOUL WITH SIGHT HATH SHRIVEN OF GLORY UNTO WHICH NO WIGHT HATH STRIVEN ERE HE ESCAPED EARTHS CAVE OF CARE UNCOUTH
I HAD ALSO MADE SEVERAL LITTLE THINGS FOR THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA AND A SMALL SILVER VASE OF RICH WORKMANSHIP WHICH I MEANT TO PRESENT TO MADAME DETAMPES
THE OLD WOMAN TOOK ME SHARPLY UP SAYING THAT I HAD NO SAVOIR VIVRE ONLY WAIT TILL DAYBREAK AND SHE WILL COME OF HERSELF
AFTER THIS HE WANTED TO BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH ME
FRIEND BENVENUTO ALTHOUGH MY OFFICE IS WONT TO FRIGHTEN MEN I COME TO SET YOUR MIND AT REST AND TO DO THIS I HAVE FULL AUTHORITY FROM HIS HOLINESS OWN LIPS WHO TOLD ME HOW HE ALSO ESCAPED FROM SANT ANGELO BUT HAD MANY AIDS AND MUCH COMPANY ELSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IT
AFTERWARDS I LEARNED THAT THE YOUNG MAGALOTTI TO WHOM I SHOWED THAT COURTESY HAD SCOLDED THEM ROUNDLY
THEN EXCHANGING GLANCES ONE WITH THE OTHER AND MAKING SIGNS OF MUCH SURPRISE THEY LEFT ME
SINCE YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME HERE I MUST PERFORM SOME ACTION WORTHY OF A MAN; AND DIRECTING MY ARQUEBUSE WHERE I SAW THE THICKEST AND MOST SERRIED TROOP OF FIGHTING MEN I AIMED EXACTLY AT ONE WHOM I REMARKED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE REST
HIS MAJESTY THEN ANSWERED:IT IS MY WILL THAT PROVISION FOR HIS JOURNEY ACCORDING TO HIS MERITS SHOULD BE SENT HIM; AND IMMEDIATELY ORDERED HIS ADMIRAL TO MAKE ME OUT AN ORDER FOR ONE THOUSAND GOLDEN CROWNS UPON THE TREASURER OF THE EXCHEQUER
AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING HE REACHED ME A LITTLE HAMMER WITH WHICH I STRUCK THE CHISELS THE DUKE HELD AND SO THE FIGURES WERE DISENGAGED FROM THEIR EARTH AND RUST
GIOVANNI WOULD MAKE NO OTHER ANSWER THAN LET HIM BE WELCOME-BENVENUTO; 3 AND SO THEY RESOLVED AND THIS NAME WAS GIVEN ME AT HOLY BAPTISM AND BY IT I STILL AM LIVING WITH THE GRACE OF GOD
LASCAS NOVELLE LE CENE SHOULD BE STUDIED BY THOSE WHO SEEK AN INSIGHT INTO THIS CURIOUS BOHEMIA OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
NOT ONE OF THEM GAVE ME ANNOYANCE
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE SO TELL US AT WHAT PRICE IT OUGHT TO BE PAID. HE ANSWERED THAT HIS JUDGMENT WAS ALREADY FORMED THAT HE COULD NOT DISOBEY THE DUKE AND THAT MY WORK WAS RICH AND BEAUTIFUL AND EXCELLENT IN EXECUTION
THESE HUMOURS TOOK A DIFFERENT SHAPE EACH YEAR
AND SINCE THESE BUILDINGS ARE ALL RUINS AND THE RUINS HOUSE INNUMERABLE PIGEONS IT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO USE MY GUN AGAINST THESE BIRDS
BECAUSE THEY ARE OF PINE OF NO GREAT SIZE AND NO GREAT THICKNESS LOOSELY PUT TOGETHER AND NOT EVEN PITCHED
IMMEDIATELY UPON THIS I OPENED A VERY FINE SHOP IN THE BANCHI OPPOSITE RAFFAELLO AND THERE I FINISHED THE JEWEL AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW MONTHS
THE WHOLE OF ROME UPON THIS FLEW TO ARMS
HE TOLD ME THAT ASCANIO HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD MASTER AND ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT IT PROPER TO SEND HIM THE CAPE AND CAP WHICH I HAD GIVEN HIM
TO WHICH HE ANSWERED THAT THEY OUGHT TO ASK ME IF I HAD BEEN AFRAID BECAUSE HE FELT PRECISELY THE SAME AS I HAD
THEY WERE JUPITER JUNO APOLLO AND VULCAN
I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE. THEN HIS EXCELLENCY REPLIED
IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT. MAESTRO FRANCESCO DA NORCIA A MAN OF AGE AND GREAT AUTHORITY SAID
THEN HE PLACED ALL THE MEN ON THE OUTSIDE AND ME IN THE MIDDLE SAYING THERE WAS NO HONOUR TOO GREAT FOR MY DESERTS
M
THEY WERE COMING TOWARD ME FROM THE ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER
THIS NEGLECT DROVE ME HALF MAD WITH DESPAIR
AND THE ADMIRABLE REMEDIES WHICH I HAD USED BEGAN TO WORK A GREAT IMPROVEMENT AND I SOON CAME WELL OUT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS
IN THE MORNING WE ROSE WITH VERY FINE WEATHER AND WENT TO DINE IN A SMILING LITTLE PLACE CALLED LACCA
SAY TO MONSIGNOR THAT HE MUST SEND ME ONIONS IF HE WANTS ME TO GET MY STEW READY. NOR GAVE I EVER ANY OTHER ANSWER
CATS OF A GOOD BREED MOUSE BETTER WHEN THEY ARE FAT THAN STARVING
NEITHER YOU NOR THE POPE CAN THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN A PIECE OF WHICH CHRIST PLAYS A PART
XCVI WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE WE FOUND A LITTLE BIT OF LEVEL GROUND WHERE WE COULD LAND AND I SAW THAT THOSE FOUR GERMAN GENTLEMEN HAD ALREADY COME TO SHORE THERE
FOR THE GENERALS RENZO DI CERI AND ORAZIO BAGLIONI WERE WOUNDING AND SLAUGHTERING EVERYBODY WHO ABANDONED THE DEFENCE OF THE WALLS
I SENT TO THANK HIM AND KEPT THE BEST LOOK-OUT I COULD
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN WATCHING AND EXPERIENCING EVERY KIND OF SKILL
IT CAME BACK TO MY MEMORY HOW SBIETTAS WIFE HAD SET BEFORE ME PLATES AND PORRINGERS AND SAUCERS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS AND HOW THAT EVIL PRIEST SBIETTAS BROTHER AFTER GIVING HIMSELF SUCH PAINS TO DO ME HONOUR HAD YET REFUSED TO SUP WITH US
THE LAWS OF ART DO NOT ADMIT OF IT. THESE WORDS OF HIS EXCELLENCY STUNG ME SO SHARPLY THAT I ANSWERED
HOW SMALL A RECOMPENSE FOR SUCH GREAT AND NOBLE MASTERPIECES
ON THE LAST DAY FOR AFTER THIS I WENT THERE NO MORE I WAS ATTACKED BY A BAND OF MEN WHO HAD DISGUISED THEMSELVES AND DISEMBARKED FROM A MOORISH PRIVATEER
SO THAT MY SHOP CONTAINED PROPERTY OF MUCH VALUE IN JEWELS GEMS AND GOLD AND SILVER
AND I PROMISED THAT I WOULD DO SO
LANCIOTTI THERE IS SOME DOUBT ABOUT THIS WORD
SEE HERE I HAVE BROUGHT BACK ASCANIO WHOM I KEPT WITH ME NOT THINKING THAT I SHOULD OFFEND YOU. ASCANIO ADDED HUMBLY
LXXXI IT HAPPENED AT THIS TIME OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI 1 WHO TO ALL APPEARANCES HAD GOT THE GOVERNMENT OF EVERYTHING IN HIS OWN HANDS FAVOURED THE OLD MASTER OF THE MINT AGAINST THE DUKES WILL
4 I SHALL PASS THIS MATTER OVER WITHOUT FURTHER WORDS SINCE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLAN OF MY MEMOIRS MEANWHILE I WORKED DILIGENTLY AT THE DOOR AND FINISHED THE VASE TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHERS OF MIDDLING SIZE WHICH I MADE OF MY OWN SILVER
1 WALKING THUS UPON THE ROAD TO PRATI I HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE SUN SANK AND I RE-ENTERED ROME ITSELF AT A SLOW PACE
MESSER FRANCESCO YOU KNOW THAT I FIRST RECEIVED THE WORK AND THAT THE TIME HAS LONG GONE BY DURING WHICH MY RIGHT COULD BE REASONABLY DISPUTED BY ANY ONE
AGAINST THE FEAST OF S
AT LAST DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS HE SWORE TO COME WITH SPANIARDS ENOUGH TO CUT ME IN PIECES
THERE I SAW A JUDGE LIEUTENANT FOR THE KING IN CIVIL CAUSES ENTHRONED UPON A HIGH TRIBUNAL
WHEREUPON I SAID
WHEREUPON I SAID
AFTER EXAMINING THE PLAN FOR MINE AND PERCEIVING THAT IT WAS VERY INCORRECT IN MANY DETAILS I TOOK IT AND WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE DUKE
TO THIS THE KING SENT ANSWER THAT JUSTICE IN HIS REALM WAS EXCELLENTLY MAINTAINED
I NOT UNNATURALLY COMPLAINED BUT THEY RETORTED BY OSTENTATIOUSLY UNFOLDING THE DEED
I GAVE HER THIRTY SOUS A DAY PAID IN ADVANCE AND A GOOD MEAL AND OBLIGED HER TO POSE BEFORE ME NAKED
BUT WHEN THAT PRECIOUS CLAY MODEL APPEARED HE DISPLAYED IT WITH SUCH AIRS OF OSTENTATION POMP AND MOUNTEBANK CEREMONY THAT AFTER INSPECTING IT I TURNED TO MESSER ALBERTO AND SAID
YOU ARE A CRUEL MONSTER TO MALTREAT SUCH A HANDSOME GIRL SO BRUTALLY. WHEN I EXCUSED MY CONDUCT BY NARRATING ALL THE TRICKS WHICH SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD PLAYED OFF UPON ME UNDER MY OWN ROOF RUBERTA SCOLDINGLY REPLIED THAT THAT WAS NOTHING--THAT WAS ONLY FRENCH MANNERS AND SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS NOT A HUSBAND IN FRANCE WITHOUT HIS HORNS
FRANCESCO DEL NERO HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM SOMETHING OF THE TROUBLE IN MY SHOP AND HAD PUT SUSPICIONS IN HIS HEAD
RENEGADE JEWS TRAITORS IS IT THUS THAT ONE BREAKS INTO HOUSES AND SHOPS IN OUR CITY OF ROME
IT IS AS MUCH AS ONES LIFE IS WORTH TO DRAW SWORDS HERE
IF I AM PERMITTED TO DISCUSS IT ALSO WITH YOUR EXCELLENCY YOU WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO TEACH ME HOW I HAVE TO SERVE YOU. THIS COURTEOUS SPEECH OF MINE INDUCED HIM TO DISCUSS THE PLANS WITH ME
AND I HAD RECKONED UP THE SUM ON WHICH I COULD SUBSIST IF I WERE BLIND FOR LIFE
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
IT HAPPENED AT THAT TIME THAT ONE GIANGIACOMO OF CESENA A MUSICIAN IN THE POPES BAND AND A VERY EXCELLENT PERFORMER SENT WORD THROUGH LORENZO THE TRUMPETER OF LUCCA WHO IS NOW IN OUR DUKES SERVICE TO INQUIRE WHETHER I WAS INCLINED TO HELP THEM AT THE POPES FERRAGOSTO PLAYING SOPRANO WITH MY CORNET IN SOME MOTETS OF GREAT BEAUTY SELECTED BY THEM FOR THAT OCCASION
WHEN THEREFORE I SET FORTH MY CAUSE WITH SOME VEHEMENCE THE DUKE FLEW INTO THE GREATEST RAGE CONCEIVABLE
AND BESIDES HE HAD GOT DRUNK IN THE EVENING BECAUSE HE WOULD SIT BOOZING WITH ALL THE GERMANS WHO WERE THERE AND SOMETIMES HE CRIED
LET THEN NO PRINCE HOWEVER GREAT HE BE LAUGH AT GODS JUSTICE IN THE WAY THAT MANY WHOM I KNOW ARE DOING AND WHO HAVE CRUELLY MALTREATED ME AS I SHALL RELATE AT THE PROPER TIME
A PLAGUE UPON YOUR QUARRELS, AND COMPLAINING THAT HE WAS EXCOMMUNICATED BECAUSE HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO SAY A SINGLE PATERNOSTER ON THAT HOLY MORNING
ACCORDINGLY ONE DAY WHEN THE CARDINAL WAS LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW BENVENUTOS SHOP BEING UNDER THE PALACE OF THE CARDINAL HE TOOK HIS GUN AND POINTED IT UPON THE CARDINAL
THE WORK WAS BEGUN IN 1532
IT WAS NOT SO MUCH A DINNER AS AN EXCELLENT COLLATION
AND WITH THE LIQUID BATHE YOUR EYES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
HE WAS SHUT UP WITH CLEMENT IN S
COSIMO KILLED THIS MAN WITH HIS OWN HAND IN THE YEAR 1566
GO THEN AND IF A SMALL FORCE IS NOT ENOUGH USE A GREAT ONE. THE OFFICER TOOK ME IMMEDIATELY TO THE CASTLE AND THERE PUT ME IN POSSESSION NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT VIOLENCE
E CHE NOI ANDASSIMO AL BORDELLO NOTE 2
THE NIGHT HAD HARDLY ENDED INDEED IT WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK WHEN I HEARD A FURIOUS KNOCKING AT THE HOUSE-DOOR STROKE SUCCEEDING STROKE WITHOUT A MOMENTS PAUSE
I ADMIT NOTHING WHATSOEVER OF THE SORT WITH REGARD TO HER
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS SUCH AN HONEST FELLOW THAT FEARING TO GIVE ME CAUSE FOR ANGER HE HAD PAWNED NEARLY EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND WAS DEVOURED BY INTEREST IN HIS ANXIETY TO LEAVE MY MONIES UNTOUCHED
I WILL ONLY ADD THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE TRUSTED TO HER INTERVENTION FOR THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY PAID AND SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED SO MUCH MORE INTO THE BARGAIN
LI I WENT ON APPLYING MYSELF WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE UPON THE GOLD-WORK FOR POPE CLEMENTS BUTTON
O MY LORD DOES YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY REALLY MEAN THAT I SHOULD PLANT IT IN THE GARDEN OF MY HOUSE
AT THE SAME TIME SHE GAVE ME THE MEASURE AND THE STONE WHICH WAS WORTH ABOUT A HUNDRED CROWNS BEGGING ME TO BE QUICK ABOUT THE WORK
BURST FROM YOUR DUNGEON LEAP THE CASTLE WALL
HOWEVER AFTER ESCAPING FROM THE TEMPEST I THANKED GOD WITH ALL MY HEART AND RETURNED IN GLADNESS WITH MY YOUNG MEN TO THE CASTLE
AND AT THIS JUNCTURE THERE ARRIVED MESSER CHERUBINO AND THAT MILANESE SIMPLETON WHO KEPT ALWAYS MUTTERING
THE AIR WAS UNWHOLESOME WHERE WE LODGED AND TOWARD SUMMER WE ALL OF US SUFFERED SOMEWHAT IN OUR HEALTH
ASSUREDLY UPON THAT FIRST OCCASION I FELT I HAD DONE VERY WRONG AND RUBERTA REBUKED ME AFTER THIS FASHION
ALONG WITH YOU! AT THIS BOTH DUKE AND DUCHESS BURST OUT LAUGHING
THE CAPTAIN SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
I AM THE BETTER INCLINED TO HIM NOW THAT I FIND HIM POSSESSOR OF A TALENT MORE THAN I EXPECTED
HE WAS THE MOST PRESUMPTUOUS DONKEY IN THE WORLD THE ONE WHO KNEW LEAST AND WHO THOUGHT HE KNEW MOST
I TOOK THE VERY GREATEST PAINS IN MIXING THE TINTS THE METHOD OF DOING WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN IN THE PROPER PLACE
IN THAT CITY A CERTAIN MILANESE GOLDSMITH NAMED TOBBIA WAS TAKEN UP FOR FALSE COINING AND CONDEMNED TO THE GALLOWS AND THE STAKE
BUT NOTICING THAT THE OTHER WAS DIVING DOWN INTO THE DITCH I SPRANG FORWARD TO CATCH IT
IN HIS ANSWER TO MY LETTER HE TOLD ME THAT HE TOO HAD DREAMED NEARLY THE SAME AS I HAD
FROM CELLINIS RICORDI IT APPEARS THAT HE BOUGHT A FARM AT THIS VILLAGE NORTH-EAST OF FLORENCE ON OCTOBER 26 1548
COMPARING VASARIS WITH CELLINIS ACCOUNT WE ONLY NOTICE THAT THE LATTER HAS MADE BANDINELLO PLAY A LESS WITTY PART IN THE WORDY STRIFE THAN THE FORMER ASSIGNED HIM
UPON THAT SHE RELATED THAT THE MAJORDOMO HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO THE BARGELLO AND THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE TAKEN UP
SEE ABOVE P
SEE ABOVE P

SEE ABOVE P

ACCORDINGLY WHEN I SAW THAT THE SETTLEMENT WAS BEING THUS DEFERRED I SPOKE GOOD-HUMOUREDLY TO MESSER ANTONIO AND BEGGED HIM TO EXPLAIN WHY HE DID NOT COMPLETE MY PAYMENTS
LATER ON HOWEVER ONE DAY AFTER DINNER I TOOK IT TO HIS WARDROBE WHERE HE CAME TO INSPECT IT WITH THE DUCHESS AND A FEW GENTLEMEN OF THE COURT
HAVING MAINTAINED THIS ATTITUDE AWHILE HE TURNED TOWARD ME PLEASANTLY AND ASKED WHERE I HAD BEEN
I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW MY LORD THAT I DO UNDERSTAND AND THAT AS REGARDS MY CHARACTER I CONSIDER MYSELF NO LESS HONEST THAN ANY MAN WHO EVER LIVED UPON THIS EARTH
ALZò LA FEDE NOTE 2
THE HANDLE AS WELL AS THE BLADE OF THESE DAGGERS WAS MADE OF IRON AND SO TOO WAS THE SHEATH
NOW WHILE THE POPE WAS STAYING AT BOLOGNA I HAD SUFFERED FROM AN ATTACK OF INFLAMMATION IN THE EYES SO PAINFUL THAT I SCARCE COULD GO ON LIVING FOR THE TORMENT
AND SINCE YOU CANNOT SEIZE ME I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHALL TOUCH ME. THE BARGELLO UPON THIS ORDERED SOME OF HIS MEN TO ARREST ME SAYING HE WOULD LOOK TO THE SAFE-CONDUCT LATER
MATTEO DEL NASSARO A NATIVE OF VERONA WAS EMPLOYED IN FRANCE AS ENGRAVER DIE-CASTER AND MUSICIAN
AFTERWARDS I WREATHED HIS THROAT WITH CHAINS OF GOLD AND RICH JEWELS AND ORNAMENTED HIS FAIR HANDS WITH RINGS
READ THAT
THE PROFILE PORTRAITS OF MICHEL ANGELO BUONARROTI CONFIRM THIS STORY
THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVE HE LIFTED UP HIS FACE AND SAID
YOU KNOW CENCIO WHETHER I HAVE SINNED WITH YOU! HE BEGAN TO SHED TEARS AND ANSWERED NO! UPON THIS THE MOTHER SHAKING HER HEAD CRIED OUT AT HIM
THE PACKET WAS FUNNEL-SHAPED AND CELLINI POURED THE COINS OUT FROM THE BROAD END
BRING THAT TO AN END AND GO THEN WHERE YOU CHOOSE. THEY RESUMED THEIR SEATS IN A VERY ANGRY TEMPER MAKING AS THOUGH THEY DID NOT MEAN TO LISTEN TO A WORD I SAID AND AT THE SAME TIME HALF RELIEVED 1 AS THOUGH THEY HAD DISCOVERED ALL THEY WANTED TO KNOW
I ACCEPTED IT AND MEAN TO HAVE IT. HE RETORTED
OH STA CHETO SODDOMITACCIO NOTE 2
MOST REVEREND MONSIGNOR AND YOU GENTLEMEN FULFILLED WITH LEARNING
IF YOU TAKE ANOTHER LINE WITH ME I SHALL ADDRESS YOU AS BUT ONE SER PIER FRANCESCO RICCIO. HE FLEW INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT I THOUGHT HE MEANT TO GO MAD UPON THE SPOT ANTICIPATING THE TIME ORDAINED BY HEAVEN FOR HIM TO DO SO
BUT AT LAST THE MONEY WAS PAID AND I WROTE THE RECEIPT
MEANWHILE THE SPEECHES WHICH ARE USUAL UPON SUCH OCCASIONS WERE MADE IN EVERY QUARTER
I ALSO MADE ANOTHER PEDESTAL OF THE SAME SORT FOR THE STATUTE OF JUNO INTENDING TO BEGIN THAT TOO IF THE KING GAVE ME SILVER FOR THE PURPOSE
THIS MAN BEGAN AT ONCE TO ASK ME WHAT I WAS ABOUT THERE
THE DAY AFTERWARDS I MET MESSER LORENZO DE MEDICI 1 WHO TOOK ME BY THE HAND AT ONCE GIVING ME THE WARMEST WELCOME WHICH COULD BE IMAGINED BECAUSE WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER IN FLORENCE WHEN I WAS COINING FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO AND AFTERWARDS IN PARIS WHILE I WAS IN THE KINGS SERVICE
IX THAT EVENING I RODE MORE THAN TEN MILES ALWAYS AT A TROT
ALL THIS I PERFORMED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY BECAUSE THE CASTELLAN KEPT DREAMING EVERY NIGHT THAT I HAD ESCAPED WHICH MADE HIM SEND FROM TIME TO TIME TO INSPECT MY PRISON
I ALSO SAW WITHIN THE RONDURE OF THE SUN UPON THE RIGHT HAND A FIGURE ROBED LIKE A PRIEST
BENVENUTO DO AS I DESIRE
HAVE NO ANXIETY SINCE I MEAN TO CURE YOU IN SPITE OF THE ROGUES WHO SOUGHT TO WORK YOUR RUIN. MAESTRO RAFFAELLO THEN PUT IN
ON THE OTHER SIDE I WAS IN THE HANDS OF TASSO THE CARPENTER A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD RECEIVED MY INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING A WOODEN FRAMEWORK TO SET UP THE PERSEUS
NO SOONER WAS IT DONE THAN I SENT IT BY THE HAND OF MY WORKMAN PAULINO TO SHOW THAT ABLE ARTIST LUCAGNOLO OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN ABOVE
MORE THAN TEN DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND I HAD NOT PRESENTED MYSELF TO MAESTRO GIACOPINO DELLA BARCA
DO WHAT I TELL YOU
AT BOLOGNA IN 1529-30 WHICH SETTLED FOR THREE CENTURIES THE DESTINY OF ITALY
IN THIS WHILE THE KING RETURNED TO PARIS
HED ACT LIKE MEN WHO WEIGH BY REASONS SCALE NOR DARE TO SWERVE FROM TRUTH AND RIGHT ASIDE NOR WOULD CONFUSION IN THE REALM PREVAIL
RAFFAELLO EXHIBITED MY SIGNATURE AND EVERY ONE TOOK PART AGAINST ME
THEN I ASKED THEM FOR SOMETHING TO BIND UP MY WOUNDED HAND
XL I HAD ALWAYS TAKEN PLEASURE IN SEEING THE WORLD
ONE DAY FELICE HAD GONE OUT OF DOORS LEAVING ME UNDER THE CARE OF A YOUNG APPRENTICE AND A SERVANT-MAID CALLED BEATRICE
THESE WORDS WERE REPORTED TO THE DUKE BY THE MILANESE GOLDSMITH WHO HAD NOT OMITTED TO NOTICE THAT THE DUKE WANTED TO EMPLOY ME
FOR ALL THE HOUSES OF THAT CITY BEING BUILT OF PINE WOOD IT WAS THE WATCHMANS ONLY BUSINESS TO WARN FOLK AGAINST FIRE
I MADE ANSWER
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE FIT TO TOUCH THE BED OF A MAN LIKE ME
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT SER PIER FRANCESCO THE MAJORDOMO MUST HAVE SERVED ME SOME ILL TURN WITH THE DUKE WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER SUCCEED
CVI WHEN I SAW HOW RIGOROUSLY THIS AFFAIR WAS PROSECUTED I BEGAN TO THINK OF MY OWN CONCERNS AND SAID
THE CARDINAL CORNARO ALSO SENT GOOD STORE OF VIANDS FROM HIS KITCHEN
I THINK I COULD HAVE GOT IT FOR 15,000 OR LESS
HE LOADED ME WITH ATTENTIONS AND TOOK ME TO SBIETTAS HOUSE WHERE I FOUND THAT FELLOWS STRUMPET OF A WIFE WHO ALSO OVERWHELMED ME WITH CARESSES
PANDOLFO DELLA STUFA HAD BEEN CUP-BEARER TO CATERINA DE MEDICI WHILE DAUPHINéSS
TELL HIM TO KEEP HIS EYE ON ME AND GIVE ME TIME TO RECOVER
THEN MESSER ALBERTO BENDEDIO IN THE HIGH AND MIGHTY MANNER WHICH BELONGED TO HIM EXCLAIMED
I OBTAINED AN INKLING OF THESE DESIGNS
THE CURIOUS WAY IN WHICH MESSER SFORZA AND SOME OTHER GENTLEMEN CLOSE TO HIS EXCELLENCYS PERSON EYED ME PROMPTED ME TO ASK THE FORMER WHAT THE MATTER WAS
HE WAS A MAN OF MARK IN THE LITERARY SOCIETY OF THE AGE
THE JUPITER WAS RAISING HIS THUNDERBOLT WITH THE RIGHT HAND IN THE ACT TO HURL IT
THE GOOD POPE QUITE OBLIVIOUS OF HIS EXTRAVAGANCES AT THE TERMINATION OF THE LAST PIECE SAID TO ME
SO HAVE YOUR WILL
TALK NO MORE ABOUT IT RAFFAELLO
I GOT THE FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS OF GOLD AND TOOK UP MY QUARTERS AT PARIS IN A HOUSE OF THE CARDINAL OF FERRERA
BENVENUTO
BENVENUTO
MY BENVENUTO YOU MUST KNOW THAT A PRISONER IS NOT OBLIGED AND CANNOT BE OBLIGED TO KEEP FAITH ANY MORE THAN AUGHT ELSE WHICH BEFITS A FREE MAN
O MY DEAR BENVENUTO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT JUDGMENT IN THESE MATTERS
I WAS LEFT UPON A WRETCHED MATTRESS UNDER THE CARE OF A GUARD WHO KEPT ALL NIGHT MOURNING OVER MY BAD LUCK AND SAYING TO ME
GLI AREBBE FATTI PIù USCIRE DE GANGHERI WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM STILL MORE OFF THE HINGES
NOTWITHSTANDING I HAD VERY MUCH TO DO HE KEPT GIVING ME FRESH COMMISSIONS
BENVENUTO I WILL GIVE WAY TO YOU UPON THE POINT OF STATUARY BUT IN THIS ART OF FORTIFICATION I CHOOSE THAT YOU SHOULD CEDE TO ME
XCII WHEN I RETURNED TO MY SHOP I SET MY HAND WITH DILIGENCE TO FINISHING THE DIAMOND RING CONCERNING WHICH THE FOUR FIRST JEWELLERS OF ROME WERE SENT TO CONSULT WITH ME
ON NOVEMBER 18 1532 CLEMENT WENT TO MEET CHARLES V
THE RASCALLY FELLOWS BEGAN BY SAYING THAT I HAD GONE OFF WITH THE KINGS SILVER AND TOLD MESSER GUIDO AND THE BISHOP OF PAVIA TO SEND AT ONCE OFF AFTER HIS MAJESTYS VASES
THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD COME TO HER ASSISTANCE
IN HIS RICORDI CELLINI CALLS THE MAN GIROLAMO PASCUCCI
YOU WILL FIND IT A BIG STONE
THE CHAPEL OF THE CARMINE PAINTED IN FRESCO BY MASACCIO AND SOME OTHER ARTIST POSSIBLY FILIPPINO LIPPI IS STILL THE MOST IMPORTANT MONUMENT OF FLORENTINE ART SURVIVING FROM THE PERIOD PRECEDING RAPHAEL
THE WAR ENDED IN THE CAPITULATION OF SIENA IN 1555
I MUST KISS YOU ONCE AGAIN IF ONLY TO INSULT THAT TRAITOR BENVENUTO. AT THAT MOMENT ANNOYED AS I WAS BY THE PRICKLES AND IRRITATED BY THE YOUNG MANS WORDS I SPRANG FORTH LIFTED MY SWORD ON HIGH AND SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE
LEARN NOW WHAT SHIFTS ONE MAY BE PUT TO HERE
BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HIS RELIGION I FOUND HIM THE BIGGEST SCOUNDREL IN THE WORLD TO WHOM ALL KINDS OF VICES WERE ACCEPTABLE
WHEN I LEFT HIS EXCELLENCY I RECEIVED SOME SLIGHT ASSISTANCE
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE BOY WHO WAS BENEATH THE PENTACLE SHRIEKED OUT IN TERROR THAT A MILLION OF THE FIERCEST MEN WERE SWARMING ROUND AND THREATENING US
SO EXPLAIN YOUR PLAN AND I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU MAY ORDER ALBEIT MUCH AGAINST MY WILL. ACCORDINGLY WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT AND I DISCLOSED TO HIM THE DETAILS OF MY SCHEME WHICH WAS CERTAIN TO HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PORTRAY YOUR MAJESTY YOUR VERY SELF IN THE GREAT CENTRAL STATUE
SO WITH GODS ASSISTANCE I ESCAPED FROM A GREAT DANGER
IN ADDITION TO MANY TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS AND INGENIOUS DEVICES I SUPPLIED IT WITH TWO ISSUES FOR THE METAL BECAUSE THIS DIFFICULT AND TWISTED FIGURE COULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE COME OUT PERFECT
IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE CARDINAL WAS ARCHBISHOP OF MILAN
THE OPENING WAS VERY NEARLY SQUARE AND ABOVE IT WAS A HEMICYCLE FLATTENED LIKE THE HANDLE OF A BASKET
SO I SET MYSELF TO WORK WITH MY TWO MEN AND MADE GREAT PROGRESS WITH THE JUG AND BASIN
NOW THE KING WAS INFORMED THAT I HAD COMMENCED WORKING FOR THE DUKE OF FLORENCE AND BEING THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE OFTEN ASKED
CVIII THE DUKE WAS STAYING AT LIVORNO WHERE I WENT TO VISIT HIM IN ORDER MERELY TO OBTAIN RELEASE FROM HIS SERVICE
THOUGH A GREAT PATRON OF THE ARTS AND AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF M
I POLITELY EXHIBITED MY DRAWINGS AND TOOK INFINITE PAINS TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND MY PURPOSE
AFTERWARDS UPON THE DAY APPOINTED I WALKED IN PROCESSION VERY HONOURABLY BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN AND SO GOT CLEAR AT LAST
I SAID THAT I WAS BORN FREE AND FREE I MEANT TO LIVE AND THAT THERE WAS NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM FAR LESS OF ME SINCE SOME FEW CROWNS OF WAGES WERE STILL DUE TO ME
WHEN SHE BEGAN TO REMONSTRATE
ALLUSION TO HIS VISION OF THE SUN IN THE DUNGEON
1 MY APPRENTICES PAGOLO AND ASCANIO WERE ALSO FURNISHED WITH GOOD MOUNTS
IT SEEMS THAT HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO MESSER GIROLAMO GILIOLO TO REWARD ME FOR MY LABOUR WITH A DIAMOND RING WORTH TWO HUNDRED CROWNS WHICH WAS TO BE PRESENTED BY FIASCHINO HIS CHAMBERLAIN
THE COMMOTION WE WERE MAKING STIRRED UP ALL THE NEIGHBOURS WHO CAME CROWDING ROUND TOGETHER WITH SOME ROMAN GENTLEMEN WHO CHANCED TO PASS AND CRIED
THERE I FOUND MY MOST FAITHFUL FELICE TO WHOM I ABANDONED MY OLD SHOP WITH ALL ITS FURNITURE AND APPURTENANCES AND OPENED ANOTHER MUCH LARGER AND ROOMIER NEXT TO SUGHERELLO THE PERFUMER
I PRAY GOD THEREFORE THAT IF IT BE HIS PLEASURE HE WILL SAVE ME FROM THIS FEARFUL PERIL
AND YET I WAS RATHER THE LOSER THAN THE GAINER
SO THEN SPEAK OUT WITH FRANKNESS AND PERFECT CONFIDENCE
THEN THE POPE BESTOWED ON ME THE MOST FAMILIAR CARESSES WHICH CAN BE IMAGINED AND EXCLAIMED
IN AN INSTANT HE ASSUMED SO HORRIBLE AN ASPECT AS TO FRIGHTEN ME OUT OF MY WITS AND CRIED

YOU ARE WELCOME
AND AS ALL WHO READ HIS BOOK MUST TESTIFY A GREAT MASTER OF NARRATIVE
WHEN I GOT AMONG THEM RAGING LIKE A MAD BULL I FLUNG FOUR OR FIVE TO THE EARTH AND FELL DOWN WITH THEM MYSELF CONTINUALLY AIMING MY DAGGER NOW AT ONE AND NOW AT ANOTHER
I MIGHT ENLARGE AT GREAT LENGTH ON THIS CURIOSITY
IT WAS MY CUSTOM TO PASS THE EVENING IN THE DUKES WARDROBE WHERE DOMENICO POGGINI AND HIS BROTHER GIANPAGOLO WERE AT WORK UPON THAT GOLDEN CUP FOR THE DUCHESS AND THE GIRDLE I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED
NOW THE MOUTHS OF THE MOULD WERE PLACED ABOVE THE HEAD OF PERSEUS AND BEHIND HIS SHOULDERS
2 AND HAVING NEARLY CONCLUDED THE AGREEMENT THE POPE IN HIS EXTREMITY TO SHOW THE MAN SOME MARK OF FAVOUR LET FALL A DIAMOND FROM HIS FINGER WHICH WAS WORTH ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND CROWNS AND WHEN ISCATINARO STOOPED TO PICK IT UP THE POPE TOLD HIM TO KEEP IT FOR HIS SAKE
AND THIS MAN NOW KEPT FREQUENTLY REPEATING IN MY EAR
AND IF I WERE TO RELATE IN DETAIL ALL THE SPLENDID THINGS I DID IN THAT INFERNAL WORK OF CRUELTY I SHOULD MAKE THE WORLD STAND BY AND WONDER
WHILE MAKING GOOD CHEER TOGETHER THEY ASKED ME HOW LONG I INTENDED TO REMAIN IN VENICE THINKING THAT I WAS ON MY RETURN JOURNEY INTO FRANCE
ONE THINKS THAT YOU WILL NEVER GET IT DONE. IN A RAGE I UP AND ANSWERED
THAT MENACE WORKED SO FORCIBLY UPON THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ONCE MORE DESPATCHED RAFFAELLO SCHEGCIA THE SAME MAN WHO NEGOTIATED THE FORMER ARRANGEMENT
HEARING THIS I BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID PLEASANTLY TO SANSOVINO
WHEN I FOUND I HAD BEEN CHEATED AND MY CLOTHES TAKEN FROM ME AND MY BROTHER FROM WHOM I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED THEM WAS GONE I ASKED MY FATHER WHY HE SUFFERED SO GREAT A WRONG TO BE DONE ME SEEING THAT I WAS ALWAYS READY TO ASSIST HIM
AT LEAST ONCE EVERY DAY THERE CAME TO VISIT ME A SORT OF BLOCKHEAD NAMED MESSER FRANCESCO SODERINI
AND FRANCESCO DEL NERO BEING ALSO IN THE PRESENCE THIS SEEMED TO MAKE HIM HALF SORRY THAT HE HAD NOT GUESSED THE TRUTH
IT WAS A VAST AND PRODIGIOUS UNDERTAKING AS MAY STILL I SUPPOSE BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO GO THERE
MOREOVER THIS POOR MAN WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO ROME WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE EMPLOYED. THE POPE WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HIS CHALICE VERY WILLINGLY ADOPTED THE ADVICE OF THE MILANESE GENTLEFOLK
I HAVE DONE WITH YOU
THE ITALIAN IS ACQUA MORTA PROBABLY A SLANG PHRASE FOR URINE
FROM THESE I SELECTED PRESENTS FOR MY WORKPEOPLE GIVING EACH SOMETHING ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DESERT DOWN TO THE SERVANT-GIRLS AND STABLE-BOYS IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO AID ME HEARTILY
AND IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT HE WAS CALLING ATTENTION TO HIS OWN HUGE ROGUERIES
WE MADE THE BARGAIN AND ANGELICA ENTREATED ME TO BY HER A GOWN OF BLACK VELVET BECAUSE THE STUFF WAS CHEAP AT NAPLES
AND I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT ANY DEFENSE AGAINST THEIR CHICANERY
TO THIS I ADDED THAT HE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO HIS OWN LAND WHICH WAS GOVERNED BY A PRINCE RENOWNED FOR JUSTICE AND THE GREATEST LOVER OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES WHO EVER SAW THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD
I MADE THE TWO LADS GO IN FRONT AND TOLD THEM TO OPEN THE DOOR EXACTLY WHEN I GAVE THE WORD TO DO SO
WHEN THEREFORE THE CARDINAL OBSERVED THAT THE POPE WAS WELL DISPOSED AND RIPE TO GRANT FAVOURS HE BEGGED FOR ME AT THE KINGS DEMAND PRESSING THE MATTER HOTLY AND PROVING THAT HIS MAJESTY HAD IT MUCH AT HEART
WE DINED GAILY TOGETHER PLACING THE SALT-CELLAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AND THUS WE WERE THE FIRST TO USE IT
GET AWAY WITH YOU WITH GODS CURSE ON YOU
DEAREST BROTHER DO NOT BE UPSET BY MY GRAVE ACCIDENT
THENCE WE CAME TO USANNA FROM USANNA TO GINEVRA FROM GINEVRA TO LIONE ALWAYS SINGING AND LAUGHING
SO THEY TOLD ME I WAS IN THE WRONG
MESSER GIOVANNI TOLD ME NOTHING TILL THE GIRL WAS MARRIED WHICH HAPPENED IN A FEW MONTHS
HE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND SAID
AT THESE WORDS A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE GENTLEMEN CAME ROUND EXPRESSING GREAT COMPASSION FOR ME
WHISPERING WITH HIS ADMIRAL HE SAID THAT THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA HAD BEHAVED VERY BADLY IN THE MATTER
DURING MY NATURAL LIFE
SHE TOLD HIS MAJESTY HE OUGHT TO COMMISSION ME TO EXECUTE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL FOR THE DECORATION OF HIS FAVOURITE RESIDENCE
I WAS SUFFERING FROM
II

THESE WERE ACCORDINGLY MADE OUT
THE HOST SAID TO HIM
HE HAD AN ONLY SON A BASTARD TO WHOM HE OFTEN GAVE HIS ORDERS IN ORDER TO SPARE ME
THE CHANCELLOR BOUND US OVER UPON BAIL ON BOTH SIDES
O MY GLORIOUS PRINCE TRUE AND MOST GENEROUS LOVER OF THE ARTS AND OF THOSE WHO EXERCISE THEM
NOW THAT I FELT MY VIGOUR RETURNING AND SAW THAT I WAS USED FOR NOTHING IT PAINED ME TO LOSE TIME WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SPENT UPON MY ART
THE POPE HATH SENT US
LUIGI ALAMANNI A GENTLEMAN OF FLORENCE AND AN ACCOMPLISHED POET
ACCORDINGLY THIS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED WAY OF DEALING WITH ME PUT ME IN A FURY AND I WAS ESPECIALLY ENRAGED BY THE MANNER WHICH THAT VENOMOUS TOAD ASSUMED IN DISCHARGING HIS COMMISSION
THE EIGHT OR GLI OTTO WERE A MAGISTRACY IN FLORENCE WITH COGNIZANCE OF MATTERS AFFECTING THE INTERNAL PEACE OF THE CITY
THE NUMBER OF THEM WAS SO ENORMOUS CART JOSTLING WITH CART AND THE CONFUSION WAS SO GREAT THAT I TOLD THE GUARDS TO LOOK OUT LEST THE SAME MISADVENTURE SHOULD HAPPEN AT THIS GATE AS HAD OCCURRED AT THE GATES OF TURIN
SO THAT I ENJOYED MYSELF AS MUCH AS I HAVE EVER DONE
IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO SHUN THE FIRST FURY OF THE STORM BY FLIGHT AND NOT TO RISK MYSELF IN ANY HOUSE IN ROME
THIS MAKES ONE WEEP THAT ONE WAS BORN TO BE
TO THIS I REPLIED THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS WERE NOT WARRANTED BY JUSTICE NEITHER COULD A POPE ACT THUS
1 HAVING PUT MYSELF TO WORK THERE I BEGAN TO MAKE SOME CANDELABRA FOR THE BISHOP OF SALAMANCA A SPANIARD
SEEING THAT THE THING WAS GOING ILL FOR THEIR OWN MAN THEY PUT HAND TO THEIR SLINGS A STONE FROM ONE OF WHICH HIT MY POOR BROTHER IN THE HEAD
TO THIS REQUEST HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD SUPPLY ME WITH VICTUALS
THE LETTER I HAVE MENTIONED WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT I SHOULD DO WELL IF I RESUMED THE SERVICE OF CLEMENT AND THAT THIS WAS SURE TO TURN OUT TO MY ADVANTAGE
LET ME GO AND I PROMISE NOT TO RETURN FOR A LONG WHILE. BEATRICE IN THE MEANTIME HAD RUN INTO MY BEDROOM SHRIEKING LOUDLY
THE KING EXCLAIMED AT ONCE
HIS FATHER SERVED LORENZO AND PIERO
AND I BEING OUT OF TEMPER WITH MANTUA OUR BAD FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL
SET YOUR MIND AT REST THEN. I WHO FELT SURE THAT HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID WAITED WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE FOR THE MORROW
HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE BISHOPRIC WAS TOMASO CORTESI THE DATARY MENTIONED ABOVE
THEN ALL TOGETHER WE ISSUED WITH HIM FROM THE CIRCLE HUDDLING AS CLOSE AS WE COULD TO ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY THE BOY WHO HAD GOT INTO THE MIDDLE AND TAKEN THE NECROMANCER BY HIS GOWN AND ME BY THE CLOAK
BUT THE MORE HE BEGGED THE TIGHTER I CLASPED IT CRYING AND SAYING I WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO ANY ONE
HE WAS DEAD
IN DUE COURSE I CAME BEFORE THE BOARD AND THEY TOLD ME WHAT THE DUKE HAD ARRANGED
THE THIRD IS MUSIC WHICH CANNOT BE OMITTED FROM THE SPHERE OF INTELLECTUAL CULTURE
IF AN INFIRMIDY HAS BLINDED ME AM I BOUND TO GO ON WORKING? HE RETORTED
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING. THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING
AFTERWARDS I BEGAN TO MODEL FROM HER DURING WHICH OCCURRED SOME AMOROUS DIVERSIONS
CX I HAD CRAWLED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PACES FROM THE PLACE WHERE I FELL TO THE GATE BY WHICH I ENTERED
BUT I HAVE THE FIRMEST CONVICTION THAT YOU WILL FIND EVEN THIS NOTED UPON THE REGISTER
BUT I EXPANDED IT WITH LENGTHY COMPLIMENTS EXPRESSING MY GRATITUDE TOWARD HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
FRANçOIS LALLEMAND SEIGNEUR DE MARMAGNE
THE NICKNAME CARADOSSO IS SAID TO HAVE STUCK TO HIM IN CONSEQUENCE OF A SPANIARD CALLING HIM BEARS-FACE IN HIS OWN TONGUE
ON ARRIVING THERE WE FOUND NICCOLò BENINTENDIS BROTHER WITH THREE COMRADES WAITING FOR ME
THE CARDINAL THEN BADE ME GO BACK TO PARIS AND WAIT THERE EIGHT DAYS DURING WHICH TIME HE WOULD PROCURE THE KINGS LICENSE FOR ME
AND AFTER A BRIEF SPACE I BEHELD IN ONE MOMENT THE WHOLE MIGHT OF THOSE GREAT BURNING RAYS FLING THEMSELVES UPON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SUN
AND ON HIS EXAMINING PAGOLO WE DISCOVERED THAT THE WOUND WAS ONLY SKIN-DEEP
MESSER FRANCESCO YOU MUST KNOW THAT THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN DOES NOT CALL FOR DRINKING AT THE COMMENCEMENT
IF ONE OF YOU COMES OUT OF THE SHOP LET THE OTHER RUN FOR THE CONFESSOR BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO HERE. THESE WORDS SO FRIGHTENED THEM THAT NOT ONE STIRRED TO HELP THEIR COUSIN
XV WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS THE GREAT FAVOUR SHOWN ME BY THE KING MADE ME A MARK FOR ALL MENS ADMIRATION
THE HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED WAS STILL FULL OF THE FINE STUDIES WHICH HIS FATHER HAD MADE BOUND UP IN SEVERAL BOOKS OF DRAWINGS BY HIS HAND AND TAKEN FROM THE BEST ANTIQUITIES OF ROME
BUT IT FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND THAT IF I DREW SOME TERRIBLE MISCHIEF MIGHT RESULT FOR PERSONS WHO WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT
LET ME HAVE SOMETHING GOOD TO BREAK MY FAST ON. SO I SUPPLIED HER WELL WITH FOOD AND PARTOOK OF IT AT THE SAME TABLE IN SIGN OF RECONCILIATION
NOW THEN MY LORD PUT TRUST IN ME
ON THE FOLLOWING DAY BOLOGNA CAME TO PARIS ON PURPOSE AND SENT FOR ME THROUGH MATTIO DEL NASARO
ABOUT THAT TIME THERE CAME TO FLORENCE A SCULPTOR NAMED PIERO TORRIGIANI
IT IS ONLY KNOWN OF THIS MAN THAT HE WAS A KNIGHT OF JERUSALEM AND HAD BEEN COMMENDATORE OF PRATO IN 1511
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL. SOME OF HIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING COURTIERS WHO WERE PRESENT SAID
THIS WAS THE FIRST EARNING THAT I TOUCHED AT ROME AND PART OF IT I SENT TO ASSIST MY GOOD FATHER
THE GUIDE WHO ATTENDED US WENT ALONG THE DYKED BANK OF A LAKE
SO I WENT BACK ALONE THROUGH STRADA GIULIA CONSIDERING HOW BEST TO PUT MYSELF IN SAFETY
THEY TOLD ME HOW FRA GIOVAN AGNOLO DE SERVI 3 HAD CONSTRUCTED A FOUNTAIN FOR THEM COMPLETE IN ALL PARTS AND DECORATED WITH A MULTITUDE OF FIGURES
AND FOR ALL THE OTHERS I HAD COMMITTED IN THE CASTLE IN THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH
THE TWO YOUNG FELLOWS WAGGED THEIR HEADS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND WITHDREW INSIDE THE HOUSE
I ALSO DETERMINED TO ABANDON MY ART SO SOON AS I HAD MADE A CHRIST THREE CUBITS IN HEIGHT REPRODUCING SO FAR AS I WAS ABLE THAT INFINITE BEAUTY WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF REVEALED TO ME
SHE BEING MY GREAT ENEMY PAINTED MY PORTRAIT STILL BLACKER TO THE KING WITH ALL HER GREATER ELOQUENCE AND ALL HER GREATER WEIGHT OF INFLUENCE
BUT DO NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT. THEN HE DISMISSED ME WITH GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS OF GOOD-WILL AND I WENT HOME
BUT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT MAESTRO GIACOMO MADE AS THOUGH HE WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE CURE AND SO HE GOT THEM
ON THE ARRIVAL OF THESE WORTHY MEN I WAS GREATLY COMFORTED AND TALKED REASONABLY WITH THEM AWHILE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT FREQUENTLY URGING FELICE TO DRIVE THE OLD MAN AWAY
HAVING ACHIEVED THIS FEAT I WAITED TILL THE LIGHT CAME ON MY PRISON
IN THOSE DAYS THE MUSICIANS OF THE SIGNORY WERE ALL OF THEM MEMBERS OF THE MOST HONOURABLE TRADES AND SOME OF THEM BELONGED TO THE GREATER GUILDS OF SILK AND WOOL
SOMETIMES HOWEVER I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH GOD BY SAYING
HE WAS A DISTINGUISHED MAN OF LETTERS
THEN THE HOST CAME WITH A LIGHT WHILE I WITHDREW UPSTAIRS AND PUT MY SWORD BACK IN ITS SCABBARD
I WAS WELL LODGED AND LEFT TO ENJOY THE COMFORTS OF MY SITUATION
SO THAT THE MEN WHO BUY UP LAWSUITS ENGAGE AT ONCE THE SERVICES OF FOUR OR SIX OF THESE FALSE WITNESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR NEED
AH CRUEL YE
ONE DAY AMONG OTHERS AFTER IT HAD RAINED A LITTLE AND HE WAS MAKING HIS HORSE CURVET JUST BEFORE PANTASILEAS DOOR HE SLIPPED AND FELL WITH THE HORSE UPON HIM
YET IF YOU WANT ME TO HAVE IT COVERED UP I WILL DO SO AT ONCE. HE ADDED MANY OTHER WORDS IN MY HONOUR BEFORE A CROWD OF GENTLEMEN WHO WERE THERE
AS CHANCE WOULD HAVE IT SIGNOR PIER LUIGI THE POPES SON HAPPENED TO BE PRESENT AND ALL THE COMPANY GAVE SIGNS OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT
MEANWHILE WARS AND RUMOURS OF WARS WERE ON THE INCREASE
VERILY I HAVE FOUND A MAN HERE AFTER MY OWN HEART. THEN HE CALLED THE TREASURERS WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR MY SUPPLIES AND TOLD THEM TO DISBURSE WHATEVER I REQUIRED LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HERE? I UNCOVERED THE PEARLS AND SAID
FOR EVEN ANNIBALE CARO WHO OWED MUCH TO HIS PATRONAGE AND LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN HIS HOUSE NEVER BECAME ATTACHED TO HIM
I MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET BACK THE BODY OF THE VASE WHICH HE HAD BEGUN BADLY AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID TOGETHER WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE SILVER
THEN THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT FURTHER ARGUMENT
WHY HAVE YOU COME BACK SO QUICKLY
AT THE STROKE OF FOUR THE BARGELLO CAME INTO MY ROOM WITH A BAND OF CONSTABLES
HAVING THUS SETTLED DOWN TO WORK I WENT AFTER TWO DAYS TO VISIT MESSER GIULIO ROMANO THAT MOST EXCELLENT PAINTER OF WHOM I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN AND MY VERY GOOD FRIEND
COME ALONG WITH ME; AND SO WE TOOK LEAVE OF OUR POOR FATHER
MEANWHILE MESSER TRAIANO POMPEOS RELATIVE AND FIRST CHAMBERLAIN TO THE POPE SENT A MILANESE OF HIGH RANK TO CARDINAL DE MEDICI GIVING HIM NEWS OF THE GREAT CRIME I HAD COMMITTED AND CALLING ON HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP TO CHASTISE ME
IF HOWEVER I AM CALLED FOR I WILL ALWAYS ANSWER. THE LETTER CONTAINED MANY FURTHER PARTICULARS WORTHY OF THE KINGS ATTENTION AND PROPER TO THE PRESERVATION OF MY HONOUR
BUT AFTER HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO BECOME MY MOTHER-PERHAPS WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THAT LITTLE FLUTE TO WHICH INDEED HE PAID MORE ATTENTION THAN WAS PROPER-HE WAS ENTREATED BY THE FIFERS OF THE SIGNORY TO PLAY IN THEIR COMPANY
COSIMO CHOSE THE SUBJECT OF PERSEUS BECAUSE IT SYMBOLISED HIS OWN VICTORY OVER THE GORGON OF TYRANNICIDE AND REPUBLICAN PARTISANSHIP
WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED THE DUKE RECEIVED ME VERY KINDLY
VERY MANY OF THEM DID I LOSE IN THIS WAY
THE EXCELLENT YOUNG FELLOW BESOUGHT ME TO KEEP QUIET AND NOT TO LET SUCH WORDS OF MINE BE HEARD FOR THEY MIGHT DO ME SOME GRAVE INJURY
I TAUGHT YOU TO PLAY WITH ALL THE LITTLE ART YOU HAVE AND YOU ARE PREVENTING MY SON FROM OBEYING ME
THE WORDS VENIRE A TRIBULARE MIGHT MEAN TO GET BY ANY MEANS HOWEVER INCONVENIENT TO FLORENCE. I HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER INTERPRETATION IN THE TEXT AS MORE CONSONANT WITH THE ITALIAN IDIOM
IT WAS A MAUNDY THURSDAY
IN THIS WAY THE MALE LINE OF LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT WAS EXTINGUISHED
AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
IT MUST MOST BLESSED FATHER BE ALLOWED THAT IN THOSE CASES WHERE MEN ARE RISKING ALL UPON ONE THROW IT IS NOT WRONG TO DO AS CERTAIN POOR AND SIMPLE MEN ARE WONT TO SAY WHO TELL US WE MUST MARK SEVEN TIMES AND CUT ONCE
1 HE WAS A SIENESE AND A MAN OF GREAT ABILITY WHO COULD HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST ANY OTHER WORKMAN IN THAT ART
VERY DIFFERENT STORIES WERE CURRENT ON THE SUBJECT
GO TELL THIS TO OTTAVIANO DE MEDICI AND SHOW HIM HOW IT IS. 3 I LOST NO TIME
HE SET THE BONE WITH DEXTERITY THEN BOUND THE LIMB UP AND BLED ME WITH HIS OWN HAND
XII WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY HEALTH I RETURNED TO MY OLD FRIEND MARCONE THE WORTHY GOLDSMITH WHO PUT ME IN THE WAY OF EARNING MONEY WITH WHICH I HELPED MY FATHER AND OUR HOUSEHOLD
3 AND HERE WE USED TO PASS AN HOUR OR TWO PLEASANTLY TOGETHER
HE SAID THAT THE CUSTOM WAS SO IN FLORENCE SINCE A CERTAIN SER MAURIZIO THEN HELD OFFICE WHO WAS CAPABLE OF PUTTING S
AND IN THE PROPER PLACE I SHALL DEMONSTRATE THAT I ATTAINED MY OBJECT
NOW I SHALL KEEP HIM STRAITLY UNDER LOCK AND KEY AND SHALL TAKE GOOD CARE TO DO HIM NO MORE SERVICE. ACCORDINGLY HE HAD ME SHUT UP WITH DISAGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AMONG THE WORST OF WHICH WERE THE WORDS FLUNG AT ME BY SOME OF HIS DEVOTED SERVANTS WHO WERE INDEED EXTREMELY FOND OF ME BUT NOW ON THIS OCCASION CAST IN MY TEETH ALL THE KIND OFFICES THE CASTELLAN HAD DONE ME
RATHER POOR-SPIRITED HOWEVER BUT LOYAL TO THE BACKBONE
I PERCEIVE THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY LENDS TOO READY AN EAR TO THAT FELLOW. WHEN I HAD DONE SPEAKING HE SMILED IRONICALLY AND A LITTLE ANGRILY
WHEN HE KILLED POMPEO HE GAVE HIM TWO STABS WITH A PONIARD IN THE THROAT IN THE MIDST OF TEN MEN WHO WERE GUARDING HIM
UNTO THIS GOD WHO SUPPORTS ME TO HIM IN HEAVEN I HAVE TURNED MY SOUL MY CONTEMPLATION AND ALL MY VITAL SPIRITS
WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLò DA MONTE AGUTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK
I AM ONLY DISTRESSED FOR THAT POOR FELLOW BUSBACCA WHO TIED HIS GOBLET AND HIS JEWELS TO THE VALUE OF SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DUCATS ON THE HORSES SADDLE-BOW THINKING THAT THE SAFEST PLACE
4 I FLUNG OFF MY MONKS CLOTHES AND BECAME ONCE MORE A MAN
SHE MEANS THAT YOU IMPROPERLY ABUSED HER. I RETORTED THAT SO FAR FROM BEING THE ITALIAN FASHION IT MUST BE SOME FRENCH HABIT SEEING SHE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT WHILE I WAS IGNORANT
MY FATHER WHO POSSESSED A SIMPLE VEIN OF POETRY INSTILLED IN HIM BY NATURE TOGETHER WITH A CERTAIN TOUCH OF PROPHECY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A DIVINE GIFT IN HIM WROTE THESE FOUR VERSES UNDER THE SAID ARMS OF THE MEDICI WHEN THEY WERE UNCOVERED TO THE VIEW THESE ARMS WHICH HAVE SO LONG FROM SIGHT BEEN LAID BENEATH THE HOLY CROSS THAT SYMBOL MEEK NOW LIFT THEIR GLORIOUS GLAD FACE AND SEEK WITH PETERS SACRED CLOAK TO BE ARRAYED
YOU GAVE HIM A BLOW AND NOT A BOX ON THE EAR. THE BELL WAS RUNG AND WE WERE ALL ORDERED OUT WHEN PRINZIVALLE SPOKE THUS IN MY DEFENCE TO HIS BROTHER JUDGES
AFTERWARDS MESSER ANTONIO DE NOBILI WHO HAD TO TRANSACT THE BUSINESS BEGAN TO GIVE ME FIFTY AND SOMETIMES LATER ON HE GAVE ME TWENTY-FIVE AND SOMETIMES NOTHING
APROPOS OF WHICH THE BROKEN BERNARDONE MEETING ME ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY SAID THAT THE DUCHESS HAD ASSIGNED THE MARBLE
KNOW THEN THAT MEN LIKE BENVENUTO UNIQUE IN THEIR PROFESSION STAND ABOVE THE LAW
SOFTLY
THE NECROMANCER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN I SHOULD FIND MYSELF WHERE SHE WAS SINCE THE DEVILS NEVER BREAK THEIR WORD WHEN THEY PROMISE AS THEY DID ON THAT OCCASION
2 THE MAN REPLIED THAT POPES HAVE THEIR MEAT TASTED
LET THIS SUFFICE
BUT NOW THAT HE HAS ABANDONED IT I BELIEVE IT WILL BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE A LITTLE RING OF THE SORT YOU WANT
THEN HE WOULD POSSESS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT MANY THINGS WHICH HE HAS NOT GOT. THESE PRECISE WORDS WERE REPORTED TO ME BY THE ENVOY BY WAY OF CHIDING AND ADVISING ME TO CHANGE MY CONDUCT
AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE THE WORTHY CASTELLAN LET ME ROAM AT PLEASURE OVER THE WHOLE FORTRESS
STUNG WITH RAGE HE CLAPPED HIS HAND UPON A LITTLE DAGGER WHICH HE HAD
SHE AT LEAST HAS ERRED IN NO WISE IN THIS MATTER-NO NOT AT ALL. WHEN I HEARD WHAT HE WAS SAYING I REPLIED
ONE OF THE GOLDSMITHS CALLED GIOVANBATTISTA SOGLIANI KINDLY ACCOMMODATED ME WITH PART OF HIS SHOP WHICH STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE NEW MARKET NEAR THE LANDIS BANK
NOW TELL ME YOU WHO THERE IS THAT CAN HOLD HIM BACK WHENEVER HE HAS BUT THE MIND TO CROSS THEM
FOR YOU ARE TRULY A GOD MARS THE ONLY BRAVE UPON THIS GLOBE AND ALL YOUR BRAVERY YOU USE WITH JUSTICE AND WITH PIETY IN THE DEFENCE OF YOUR OWN GLORY. SCARCELY HAD HE ALLOWED ME TO FINISH THIS ORATION WHEN HE BROKE FORTH WITH A STRONG VOICE
LUCY I NEED HARDLY REMARK IS THE PATRONESS OF THE EYES
AND WHILE HE FIXED HIS EYES ON HIM HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT HIM
THEREFORE I ADMIT THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE TO INFLICT SO SINGULAR A VENGEANCE UPON PAGOLO MICCERI
AND YOU ARE JEERING ME AS THOUGH I WERE A PARTY-LEADER
WHILE I STATIONED MYSELF INSIDE MY HOUSEDOOR WHICH I LEFT AJAR SETTING A BOY AT WATCH UPON THE STREET TO WARN ME WHEN THE PIG SHOULD LEAVE THE MINT
THIS COZENAGE GOADED ME INTO SUCH A FURY THAT I CRIED
HE ALSO JUDGED THAT THE TRIFLES WHICH I SHOWED HIM OF MY HANDICRAFT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE FOR THE EXECUTION OF SOME CONSIDERABLE THINGS HE HAD IN MIND
MY BROTHER HAD NOT AS YET LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
1 SECONDLY THE RESTORATION OF THE GANYMEDE IN MARBLE WHICH OFFERED SO MANY DIFFICULTIES AND COST ME SO MUCH TROUBLE THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE MADE THE WHOLE STATUE NEW FROM THE BEGINNING
FAR GREATER GLORY IS IT FOR ME TO DIE UNJUSTLY THAN IF I HAD DESERVED THIS FATE
ONE DAY HE SENT IN A VAST HURRY FOR ME SAYING I MUST TAKE THE POST AT ONCE IN ORDER TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE THE KING OF FRANCE WHO HAD EAGERLY BEEN ASKING FOR ME UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS IN FRANCE
HE IS IN BED WITH SOME TRIFLING INDISPOSITION. WITHOUT THINKING WHAT MY COMPLAINT MIGHT BE THE DOCTOR CAME UP AT ONCE AND WHEN HE HAD FELT MY PULSE HE SAW AND FELT WHAT WAS VERY CONTRARY TO HIS OWN WISHES
NOW HOPE IS IMMORTAL IN THE HUMAN BREAST
WHILE I WAS WALKING AWAY WITH MAESTRO GIACOPINO HE ASKED ME VERY INQUISITIVELY WHAT WAS THE CLOSE AND LENGTHY CONVERSATION I HAD HAD WITH HIS HOLINESS
AND WHEN HE SAW THE WAX MODEL FOR THE BUST HE SENT ME FIFTY GOLDEN SCUDI BY A NOTARY IN HIS EMPLOY NAMED SER GIULIANO PACCALLI
I SHALL GO AND TELL THE POPE AND I MEAN TO PROCURE FOR HIM ONE THOUSAND GOLDEN CROWNS FOR THE SETTING OF THIS DIAMOND. ACCORDINGLY HE HURRIED TO THE POPE AND TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY
I WAS ON TERMS OF THE CLOSEST INTIMACY WITH ONE MESSER GIOVANNI GADDI WHO WAS A CLERK OF THE CAMERA AND A GREAT CONNOISSEUR OF THE ARTS ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO PRACTICAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH ANY
I OUGHT TO SAY THAT BESIDE THE AID I GAVE MY FATHER AND MY EXCELLENT AND HONEST SISTERS I HAD BOUGHT THOSE HANDSOME CLOTHES OUT OF MY OWN SAVINGS
HE WENT TO FRANCE IN 1534 AND DIED AN OBSCURE DEATH THERE IN 1541
WE HAVE ALREADY MET WITH HIM IN THE CASTLE OF S
BRAVE SOLDIER IF IT HAD BEEN NIGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE SAID YOU HAD MISTAKEN ME BUT SINCE IT IS FULL DAY YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO I AM
WHEN I FOUND THAT THEY DID NOT ARRIVE I ASKED THE MESSENGER IF HE HAD DONE MY ERRAND
THEN I TOOK IT TO THE DUCHESS WHO TOLD ME GRACIOUSLY THAT I HAD PRODUCED A VERY FINE PIECE AND THAT SHE WOULD REMEMBER ME
WHILE WE WERE EXCHANGING THESE WORDS AN OLD MAN HAPPENED TO COME UP CALLED MAESTRO ANTONIO OF SAN MARINO
2 THE BOY CALLED OUT
SO HE DEPARTED AND WE BEGAN OUR SUPPER
HE RELATED HOW HE WAS IN DESPAIR AND HOW I PUT HEART INTO HIM AND WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HOW I HAD POINTED SEVERAL LARGE PIECES OF ARTILLERY IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THE CLOUDS WERE THICKEST AND WHENCE A DELUGE OF WATER WAS ALREADY POURING
POSTERITY HAS CONFIRMED CELLINIS OPINION OF BANDINELLO AS AN ARTIST
AND TAKING HORSE NEXT MORNING CAME TO A LAKE BETWEEN VALDISTATE AND VESSA
NOW LISTEN LUCA TO THE BEST OF ALL
TO THIS THE KING REPLIED THAT I MIGHT NAME A SALARY WHICH I THOUGHT SUFFICIENT FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE
BUT DELAY SPOILED ALL
AFTER HE HAD REPEATED THE QUESTION MORE THAN TWICE I SAID THAT I DID NOT MEAN TO TELL HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE MATTERS WITH WHICH HE HAD NOTHING TO DO AND THEREFORE HE NEED NOT GO ON ASKING ME
MARIA NOVELLA AND HAD ALREADY FIXED UP THE IRON CLAMPS WHEREBY I MEANT TO FASTEN IT AGAINST THE WALL
NOW HE HAD HEARD THE DUKE SAY
AND AMONG THESE WAS MY BROTHER WHOM THE DUKE ESTEEMED AS HIGHLY AS THE BRAVEST OF THEM
LET US KEEP WELL IN MIND WHAT GREAT WORKS WE HAVE BEGUN HERE AND WHAT VAST IMPORTANCE THEY POSSESS
WELCOME TO MY WORKSHOP
AS I DREW NIGH IT THE DUKE CALLED ME AND AFTER A FRIENDLY GREETING SAID
IF A GREATER POWER HAD NOT CONTROLLED THE WORKING OF MY INAUSPICIOUS STARS AND HINDERED THAT WITH WHICH THEY VIOLENTLY MENACED ME YOUR HOLINESS WITHOUT YOUR FAULT OR MINE WOULD HAVE LOST A FAITHFUL AND LOVING SERVANT
FOR NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARDS ALL THE PATIENTS HE HAD TREATED GREW SO ILL THAT THEY WERE A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE HE CAME
2 THE MIDWIFE WHO KNEW THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING A GIRL AFTER SHE HAD WASHED THE BABY AND WRAPPED IT IN THE FAIREST WHITE LINEN CAME SOFTLY TO MY FATHER GIOVANNI AND SAID
WITH WHOM AND TO WHAT EXTENT? 3 I SAID
WHEN HE HEARD THE UPROAR IN THE COURT BELOW GOOD SIGNOR ORAZIO DASHED OFF IN A HURRY
AND THEY WERE AS I HAVE SAID THE CHOICEST OF THE ROMAN ANTIQUITIES
AND WHAT I HAVE NOW TO DO IS TO LIVE AS LONG AS I CAN MANAGE
UT BIBAT POPULUS 2 AT LAST HE ADDED
EVEN SO MAY IT BE SEEN THAT GOD KEEPS ACCOUNT OF THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND GIVES TO EACH ONE WHAT HE MERITS
TESSUTO IS PROPERLY SOMETHING WOVEN A FABRIC
AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY BASTIONS I TOUCHED SOME SCORE OF CROWNS WHICH I HAD NOT EXPECTED AND WHICH WERE UNCOMMONLY WELCOME
LXXXI ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TO GO AND KISS THE POPES FEET
THE FIGURE WAS A SLENDER WOMAN DRESSED IN VERY THIN DRAPERY GATHERED AT THE WAIST WITH A LITTLE TORCH IN HER HAND WHICH WAS BURNING A HEAP OF ARMS BOUND TOGETHER LIKE A TROPHY
OH HOW IS IT THAT YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY HAS FORGOTTEN SEEING IT IN THE GARDEN OF MY HOUSE
IN REPLY BANDINELLO SAID THAT HE HAD EXAMINED THE STATUE MINUTELY AND KNEW WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT WAS WORTH
BUT HIS OWN BAD NATURE MADE HIM WAIT TILL THE KINGS FIT OF GENEROSITY WAS OVER
TO THIS I PUT A STOP AT ONCE WITH MY OWN WEAPON USING THEREWITH SPIRITED LANGUAGE AND SAYING
A MIRACLE
MY BROTHER GO YOUR WAS QUICKLY
WHEN THE LOAD REACHED ME GHERARDO PUSHED IT SO VIOLENTLY ON MY BODY THAT I WAS VERY MUCH HURT
THEREUPON THEY PUT THE WORK IN PROGRESS
THE GUARD DID THE BEST HE COULD TO COMFORT ME
583
583
AND THOUGH I CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF ANOTHER SENTINEL HE SEEMED AS THOUGH HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME
THEN I ASKED HIM TO COME AND SEE HOW FAR I HAD ADVANCED THE GREAT COLOSSUS
BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE HER UP TO ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS CALLED IL BACHIACCA WHO ON HIS SIDE HAD BEEN AND STILL WAS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH HER
THE WORK ABOVE ALLUDED TO IS THE FOUNTAIN AT MESSINA
BUT I SHOULD PREFER TO FOLLOW THOSE OF THE CELLINI OF RAVENNA WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE
PIER MARIA DI LOTTO OF S
O IMMEASURABLE GOODNESS
EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE WAS IN A PANIC
HE WAS THE SON OF A PROSTITUTE CALLED LA GAMBETTA
TO THIS COMPLIMENT I MADE A PLEASANT ANSWER
I WENT BACK MUCH HURT TO FLORENCE
NOR LET MYSELF BE TERRIFIED BY ANY FURIOUS ASSAULT OF FORTUNE OR MY ADVERSE STARS
SALVIATI MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF LORENZO DE MEDICI AND OBTAINED GREAT INFLUENCE IN FLORENCE
CONSEQUENTLY IN ALL THAT I HAVE DONE I MEANT TO ACT FOR THE BEST AND AT NO POINT TO SWERVE FROM YOUR MAJESTYS EXPRESSED WISHES
WHEN IT ARRIVED I BEGAN TO WRITE THE BEST I COULD ON SOME BLANK PAGES IN MY BIBLE AND REBUKED THE REGENTS OF MY INTELLECTUAL SELF FOR BEING TOO IMPATIENT TO ENDURE THIS LIFE
AND CAUSING PAPER TO BE PUT BEFORE ME HE COMMANDED ME TO WRITE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT I HAD BEEN AMPLY SATISFIED AND PAID IN FULL
I TOLD THEM THEY HAD GREATLY STIMULATED MY ZEAL SO THAT I HOPED AFTER A FEW YEARS WERE PASSED TO EXHIBIT ANOTHER MASTERPIECE WHICH I DARED BELIEVE WOULD YIELD FAR TRUER SATISFACTION TO OUR NOBLE SCHOOL OF FLORENCE
5 BUT AS GOD WILLED MY PONY WHO WAS THE SAME I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE TOOK AN INCREDIBLY WIDE JUMP AND BROUGHT ME OFF IN SAFETY FOR WHICH I HEARTILY THANKED GOD
FOR ONE OF THEM HAD THE FACE OF THE LION ANOTHER OF THE SCORPION A THIRD OF THE CRAB
IN HIS EARS I PLACED TWO LITTLE RINGS SET WITH TWO LARGE AND FAIR PEARLS
BUT SINCE THE POPE HAS BIDDEN ME GUARD YOU AS THOUGH YOU WERE HIS OWN EYES AND I KNOW YOU A CLEVER DEVIL WHO WOULD CERTAINLY ESCAPE I SHALL NOW HAVE YOU LOCKED UP WITH A HUNDRED KEYS IN ORDER TO PREVENT YOU SLIPPING THROUGH MY FINGERS. I THEN BEGAN TO IMPLORE HIM AND REMIND HIM THAT I MIGHT HAVE FLED BUT THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD WHICH I HAD GIVEN HIM I WOULD NEVER HAVE BETRAYED HIS TRUST
HIS EXCELLENCY HAD ALSO COMMISSIONED ME TO MAKE A LITTLE MODEL FOR A PENDENT TO SET THE GREAT DIAMOND WHICH BERNARDONE AND ANTONIO LANDI MADE HIM BUY
AND IT WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO RELATE ALL THE KNAVISH TRICKS OF THIS PRELATE
THE GENTLEMAN REFERRED THE MATTER TO THE CARDINAL WHO SAID THAT IF HE ONCE LAID HANDS ON BENVENUTO HE WOULD SOON CLEAR HIS HEAD OF SUCH FOLLY
FOR THE BEST CRAFTSMEN IN THE GOLDSMITHS TRADE DECLARED THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL OR BETTER EXECUTED
GIOVANPAGOLO AND DOMENICO POGGINI THE GOLDSMITHS WERE PRESENT
ORAZIO MURDERED SEVERAL OF HIS COUSINS IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE LORDSHIP OF PERUGIA
BUT THE NOTARY WHO DREW IT UP WAS SO OCCUPIED WITH DETAILING TWENTY-TWO BOUNDARIES DESCRIBED BY SBIETTA 2 THAT SO FAR AS I CAN JUDGE HE NEGLECTED TO INCLUDE IN THE CONTRACT WHAT THE VENDOR HAD PROPOSED TO FURNISH
SO THEY SENT THAT TRAITOR ASCANIO BY THE POST OFF ON THE SPOT
BENEDETTO VALENTI
FOR WHEN HE HEARD THAT I WAS COMING BACK TO ROME HE SWORE HE WOULD DIE TO SERVE ME AN ILL TURN
HE FELT THE MOMENT FOR HIS VOMIT AT HAND
BOLOGNA FOUND NO OTHER WORDS THAN THESE TO UTTER
AFTERWARDS WITH A VIEW TO RE-ESTABLISHING MY STRENGTH I DETERMINED TO TAKE A JOURNEY OF A FEW DAYS FOR CHANGE OF AIR
LVI I RECEIVED FREQUENT LETTERS FROM FRANCE WRITTEN BY MY MOST FAITHFUL FRIEND MESSER GUIDO GUIDI
JUMPING FROM MY BED I SEIZED MY CLOTHES AND BEGAN TO DRESS
THEY ONLY CLIPPED HIS EARS WHICH LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PIERCED
NEXT MORNING I WENT TO HIS MAJESTY AT THE SAME HOUR
BEFORE LONG THEREFORE WE ARRANGED THE MATTER OF THIS WAY
NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLò DA MONTE AGUTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
THE JUG AND BASIN WE ARE SENDING TO THE CARDINAL IN FRANCE HAVE BEEN ALREADY PACKED. HE ANSWERED THAT IT DID NOT SIGNIFY TO HIM
THEN BASTIANO VENEZIANO THE PAINTER APPROACHED AND SAID
ACCORDINGLY THEY MADE ALL READY
I TELL YOU THAT I HOPE TO COMPLETE THIS PIECE FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL BE DESTINED TO POSSESS IT
I HAD PORTRAYED EARTH UNDER THE FORM OF A VERY HANDSOME WOMAN HOLDING HER HORN OF PLENTY ENTIRELY NUDE LIKE THE MALE FIGURE
HE WAS A MAN ACCOMPLISHED AND POLITE WHO SPOKE ITALIAN EXCELLENTLY
THE DUKE CANNOT I THINK HAVE BEEN INFORMED AT ONCE OF THIS DIABOLICAL SCENE FOR I WAITED SEVERAL DAYS WITHOUT HEARING FROM HIM
HE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN A WORTHLESS AND DISHONOURED RENEGADE
FOR I PUT MY HANDS UP AND WITHDREW THEM COVERED WITH BLOOD
NOW A FERRARESE GENTLEMAN NAMED ALBERTO BENDEDIO WAS THE CARDINALS AGENT AND HE HAD BEEN TWELVE YEARS CONFINED TO HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ONCE LEAVING IT BY REASON OF SOME PHYSICAL INFIRMITY
AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS I HAD IT READY WITH LITTLE ANIMALS AND FOLIAGE AND MASKS AS BEAUTIFUL AS ONE COULD HOPE TO SEE
THESE WERE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND THEY PLACED THEM WHERE THEY COULD BE WELL SEEN
AT THE SAME TIME I NEVER STOPPED ASKING HIM IF HE BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE REUNITED TO MY SICILIAN ANGELICA AT THE TIME APPOINTED
CELLINIS BUST OF HIM STILL EXISTS IN THE PALAZZO ALTOVITI AT ROME
HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SPEAK TO ME SAYING WITH A PLEASANT CHEER THAT HAVING NOW SO FINE A BASIN AND JUG OF MY WORKMANSHIP HE WANTED AN EQUALLY HANDSOME SALT-CELLAR TO MATCH THEM
NOW THIS MAN WAS TO SOME EXTENT AN AMATEUR OF MILITARY ARCHITECTURE
HERE BEING WET TO THE SKIN TIRED OUT AND FAMISHED WE WERE MOST AGREEABLY ENTERTAINED
ON ONE SIDE ROSE A MOUNTAIN VERY TALL AND CAVERNOUS ON THE OTHER SOME FLAT LAND AND GRASSY
I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO GIVE MY OWN VERSION OF THE AFFAIR TRULY AND HONESTLY
CV ALBEIT I WAS SUFFERING SO SEVERELY I FORCED MYSELF TO WORK UPON MY COLOSSUS IN THE LOGGIA
AND IF IT WAS NOT TOO LATE I BEGGED THEM TO BLEED ME NOW
HE RAISED A LAMENTABLE DOLEFUL VOICE LIKE ONE WHO ANNOUNCES THEIR LAST HOUR TO MEN CONDEMNED TO DIE UPON THE SCAFFOLD AND SPOKE THESE WORDS
WHEN THEN HE SAW POMPEO COMING TO HIM WITH A SMILE UPON HIS LIPS AND THE MONEY IN HIS HAND HE SOUNDLY RATED HIM AND LAMENTED THAT THE AFFAIR HAD TURNED OUT SO
WHEN I OPENED THE CREATURE LAUGHED AND FELL UPON MY NECK EMBRACING AND KISSING ME AND ASKED ME IF I WAS STILL ANGRY WITH HER
I MUST NOT OMIT TO TELL YOU A THOUGHT OF MINE TO WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY MIGHT WITH ADVANTAGE PAY ATTENTION
FOR IT SEEMED TO HER MY DESERT WAS SO GREAT THAT IF I CRAVED A CASTLE SHE COULD HARDLY RECOMPENSE ME
WHEN THE METAL REACHED THE MOULD IT ENTERED IN A RED-HOT STREAM BETWEEN THE TONACA OR OUTSIDE MOULD AND THE ANIMA OR INNER BLOCK FILLING UP EXACTLY THE SPACE WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE WAX EXTRACTED BY A METHOD OF SLOW BURNING ALLUDED TO ABOVE
LONG LIVE THE GENTLEMAN
MOUNTED ON MY GOOD STEED I LOWERED THE BARREL OF MY ARQUEBUSE AND TURNING TO MY COMRADES CRIED
SO THEN FINDING MYSELF MADE MUCH OF AND BEING PRECISELY IN MY ELEMENT I GAVE SUCH ANSWER TO THE CAPTAIN AS I THINK MUST HAVE MADE HIM EARNESTLY REPENT OF HAVING COME TO LOOK ME UP
3 THE MARQUIS MUST HAVE BEEN PRESSING SOMETHING ON THE POPE WHICH HE WAS UNWILLING TO PERFORM
AFTER I HAD STAYED THERE SOME DAYS MY FATHER TOOK ME AWAY FROM MICHEL AGNOLO FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT HAVING ME ALWAYS UNDER HIS EYES
FINALLY I TOLD HER THAT I HAD EATEN QUITE ENOUGH
WE ARE NEITHER IN ROME NOR IN BOLOGNA NOR IN FLORENCE
HE WAS A MOST EXCELLENT CRAFTSMAN AND A VERY GOOD FELLOW TO BOOT HIGH-SPIRITED AND FRANK IN ALL HIS WAYS
THE TREASURER RETURNED MUCH IRRITATED SAYING HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO SCOLDED BEFORE BY THE CARDINAL
AND WE POSSESS SOME EXCELLENT MEDALLION PORTRAITS BY HIS HAND
I FOLLOWED THEM TO CIVITà VECCHIA AND DID A MULTITUDE OF MAD THINGS TO DISCOVER HER
3 POMPEO CAME TO INFORM ME THAT HIS HOLINESS HAD TAKEN MY PLACE IN THE MINT AWAY AND THAT IF I DID NOT FINISH THE CHALICE HE WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF OTHER THINGS BESIDES
FOR THEY WERE THEN WORN AS LARGE AS THAT
WHEN MY HEALTH IMPROVED I HAD CLAY BROUGHT AND TOOK A PORTRAIT OF HIS EXCELLENCY CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN LIFE-SIZE WHICH I MODELLED WHILE HE STAYED WITH ME FOR PASTIME
NOBLEMEN ARE BOUND TO TASTE THE MEAT FOR POPES
THE REST WERE IN MY CUSTODY TOGETHER WITH A MODEL OF THE DIAMOND
THE HALL WAS CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN 100 PACES DECORATED AND VERY RICH WITH PICTURES FROM THE HAND OF THAT ADMIRABLE ROSSO OUR FLORENTINE MASTER
AFTER THAT TIME A SPANISH GENTLEMAN CALLED DON DIEGO CAME TO SPEAK TO ME
SO THAT AFTER A FEW DAYS I FELL A HUNDRED TIMES MORE ILL THAN I HAD BEEN BEFORE
1 AT THE TIME WHEN THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE HIS MAJESTY SOUGHT MY ADVICE WITH REGARD TO THE INSTANTANEOUS FORTIFICATION OF PARIS
BUT WHEN HE TALKED TO ME OF MUSIC WITH HIS FINGERS ON MY PULSE SEEING HE HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH MEDICINE AND LATIN LEARNING HE FELT IT CHANGE SO MUCH IF HE APPROACHED THAT TOPIC THAT HE WAS OFTEN DISMAYED AND LEFT MY SIDE IN TEARS
NEXT MORNING THEY BROUGHT ME AN ITALIAN BIBLE WHICH BELONGED TO ME AND A COPY OF THE CHRONICLES OF GIOVANNI VILLANI
HOWEVER WE PASSED FORWARD AND ESCAPED THAT OTHER STORM
WHEREUPON EMBOLDENED BY THEIR PRAISES I REVEALED THAT I HAD MADE THEM
THANKS BE TO THAT GOD ON THIS FIRST OCCASION WHEN IT HAS PLEASED HIS DIVINE MAJESTY TO IMPRISON ME I SHOULD NOT BE IMPRISONED FOR SOME FOLLY AS THE WONT IS USUALLY WITH YOUNG MEN
3 THE MAN CAME FROM PRATO AND HAD BEEN THE DUKES PEDAGOGUE
YOU WILL BE PERMITTED LVIII THE POPE CAME BACK FROM BOLOGNA AND SENT AT ONCE FOR ME BECAUSE THE CARDINAL HAD WRITTEN THE WORST HE COULD OF MY AFFAIRS IN HIS DESPATCHES
WHEN I HAD FINISHED DRAWING OFF THE WAX I CONSTRUCTED A FUNNEL-SHAPED FURNACE ALL ROUND THE MODEL OF MY PERSEUS
ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS AWARE OF THE NOISE OF MANY HORSES
HE WAS EXTREMELY ACTIVE IN ALL PHYSICAL EXERCISES AND THE BEST SWORDSMAN IN ROME
YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE PAID 18,000 CROWNS. ON HEARING THIS THE DUKE UTTERED A LOUD OH! OPENING HIS MOUTH AS WIDE AS A WELL AND CRIED OUT
AND THIS ASTONISHED ME FAR MORE BECAUSE IT IS AT A CONSIDERABLY LOWER LEVEL THAN THAT OF THE MEDUSA
ON THE ROAD WE FELL TO CONVERSING ABOUT OUR ART WHICH MADE ME DIE OF IMPATIENCE TO GET BACK AND RECOMMENCE MY LABOURS
AS A MATTER OF FACT I SUED HIM BEFORE THE AUDITOR OF THE CAMERA AND GAINED BY SUIT
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
AND I THINK IT NOT IMPROBABLE THAT HE WROTE TO THE CARDINAL AND INFORMED HIM OF MY PURPOSE
NO SOONER HAD I REACHED HOME AND DINED WITH MERRY CHEER THAN I CALLED FOR ALL MY WARDROBE WHICH INCLUDED A GREAT MANY SUITS OF SILK CHOICE FURS AND ALSO VERY FINE CLOTH STUFFS
HOW MUCH MORE ONE OF FLESH AND BLOOD! THE QUACK RESPONDED
AS LONG AS THERE IS BREATH IN HIM CALL ME AT ALL HOURS
I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE ADMIRABLE CRAFTSMAN CARADOSSO WHO USED TO MAKE SUCH ORNAMENTS
OF THE PALATINE LIBRARY
THE SHORT AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF RAFFAELLO DA MONTELUPO A MAN IN MANY RESPECTS RESEMBLING CELLINI CONFIRMS THIS PART OF OUR AUTHORS NARRATIVE
THE FIRST FELLED HIM TO EARTH THE SECOND LOPPED THREE FINGERS OFF HIS RIGHT HAND THOUGH IT WAS AIMED AT HIS HEAD
DRESSED VERY ILL AND NEGLIGENTLY
FOR HE WAS BLIND OF THE LEFT EYE
NOW THESE TWO AGREEABLE PERSONS MET ME UPON THE PIAZZA
I ANSWERED THAT A MAN ON HORSEBACK ABOUT TO TAKE A JOURNEY OUGHT NOT TO BIND HIS SWORD
AFTER THE CONTRACT WAS SIGNED AND SEALED SBIETTA BEGAN TO PAY ME THE MOST MARKED ATTENTIONS WHICH I RETURNED IN LIKE MEASURE
LXIII THE FIRST PIECE I CAST IN BRONZE WAS THAT GREAT BUST THE PORTRAIT OF HIS EXCELLENCY WHICH I HAD MODELLED IN THE GOLDSMITHS WORKROOM WHILE SUFFERING FROM THOSE PAINS IN MY BACK
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS THE ARTICLES OF PEACE WERE SIGNED
NAY SHOULD THE DUKE HIMSELF SEND FOR ME I SHALL REPLY THAT I AM ILL AND BY NO MEANS WILL I INTRUDE AGAIN. TO THIS SPEECH SHE MADE ANSWER
HE PRODUCED IT IN COMPETITION WITH ANOTHER PAINTER LIONARDO DA VINCI WHO ALSO MADE A CARTOON
THE DUAPHIN AFTERWARDS HENRI II AND HIS WIFE THE CELEBRATED CATERINA DE MEDICI DAUGHTER OF LORENZO DUKE OF URBINO
BUT I SWEAR BY GOD THAT I WILL SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND BEFORE I DIE WILL LEAVE SUCH WITNESS TO THE WORLD OF WHAT I CAN DO AS SHALL MAKE A SCORE OF MORTALS MARVEL. WHEN I HAD GOT MY CLOTHES ON I STRODE WITH SOUL BENT ON MISCHIEF TOWARD THE WORKSHOP
FOR I SHALL CERTAINLY CONTRIVE TO ESCAPE. SO THEY TOOK AND CONFINED ME WITH THE UTMOST CARE
FOR THE HEAT OF MY INDIGNATION HAD NOT YET COOLED DOWN
THIS LITTLE PEASANT COMES HERE TO ADD TO MY GREAT TROUBLE
SO THEN BANDINELLO BEGAN AGAIN TO CHATTER AND CRIED OUT
IF NOT WE WILL TINT IT WITH THE SAME YOU SEE HERE. THAT ASS GAIO EXCLAIMED THAT IF I MADE A FOIL LIKE THAT HE WOULD GLADLY DOFF HIS CAP TO IT
SO I TOLD HIM NOT TO MAKE THE FIRE BUT FILLED MY BOOT WITH THE FEATHERS OF THE GOOSE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SO MUCH COMFORTED THAT I REGAINED VITALITY
HE JUDGED THAT IF WE KILLED THE GENERALS THE ARMY WHICH WAS ALREADY ALMOST ON THE POINT OF BREAKING UP WOULD TAKE FLIGHT
THOSE FELLOWS ARE WAITING HERE TO MURDER US. LAMENTONE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
I RECKONED THAT SINCE LANDI HAD OFFERED IT TO ME FOR 17,000 CROWNS THE DUKE MIGHT HAVE GOT IT FOR 15,000 AT THE HIGHEST
BUT IN ORDER TO AVOID PROLIXITY AND HAVING VERY MUCH TO RELATE I WILL OMIT THESE INCIDENTS
MY LORD YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY GAVE ME THE MEANS OF PRODUCING AN IMPORTANT AND VERY DIFFICULT MASTERPIECE IN THE MIDST OF THIS THE NOBLEST SCHOOL OF THE WORLD
MOST RARE AND EXCELLENT MY PATRON PETITIONS OF ANY VALIDITY AND COMPACTS BETWEEN US OF ANY VALUE DO NOT REST UPON WORDS OR WRITINGS
14
IN THIS WAY WE SHALL BOTH HAVE MORE PLEASURE THAN IF I WERE TO SUP WITH YOU. ACCORDINGLY WE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION AND PROLONGED IT FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS
AND THOUGH I HAD DECLARED I WOULD NOT GIVE A STROKE TO THE CHALICE I DID NOT DO SO BUT ALWAYS WENT ON WORKING WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST
4 HERE I HAD A SLIGHT RELAPSE OF FEVER WHICH DID NOT INTERRUPT MY JOURNEY AND COMING NOW TO AN END IT NEVER RETURNED ON ME AGAIN
MY FATHER TOOK THIS VERY ILL AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THEY HAD DONE HIM A GREAT DESPITE
AND HE ASKED ME WHETHER I HAD BOUND MY SWORD
THE CARDINAL DIVIDED HIS HOUSEHOLD WHICH WAS VERY NUMEROUS INTO TWO SECTIONS
I WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE PRECIOUS PERFUMES AND WHEN THE PRIEST PERCEIVED IN WHAT NUMBERS THEY WERE PRESENT HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
IF I HAD DONE WRONG HE COULD CHASTISE ME
YOU WOULD ACQUIT YOURSELF TO ADMIRATION IF YOU HAD THE COURAGE TO ADDRESS THE EMPEROR AS YOU ARE ADDRESSING ME. THEN I SAID THAT I HAD THE COURAGE TO SPEAK WITH FAR GREATER EASE AND FREEDOM TO THE EMPEROR SEEING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS CLOTHED AS I WAS AND THAT I SHOULD SEEM TO BE SPEAKING TO A MAN FORMED LIKE MYSELF
DANTE AND THE PAINTER GIOTTO WERE TOGETHER IN FRANCE AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CITY OF PARIS WHERE OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED THE HALL OF JUSTICE MAY BE TRULY CALLED A HELL
THIS EPIGRAM WAS READ BY ALL FLORENCE
CLAUDUNTUR BELLI PORTæ 5 DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS FINISHING THIS MEDAL THE MAN WHOM I HAD WOUNDED RECOVERED AND THE POPE KEPT INCESSANTLY ASKING FOR ME
AND MY LADS WHILE EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERN FOR THE PERIL I HAD RUN GENTLY CHIDED ME AND SAID
BERNARDI HAD BEEN IN THE DUKE OF FERRARAS SERVICE
IT WOULD NOT SUIT ME FOR THE THING IS NEITHER JUST NOR REASONABLE. HE TOLD ME TO TAKE MYSELF OFF AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO SWALLOW IT IN THIS WAY EVEN IF I BURST
THERE I FINISHED SEVERAL PRETTY PIECES AND MADE GOOD GAINS AND WAS ABLE TO GIVE MY FAMILY MUCH HELP
YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
I BEGAN TO SING A MISERERE
PIER LUIGI FARNESE PAUL IIIS BASTARD WAS SUCCESSIVELY CREATED GONFALONIERE OF THE CHURCH DUKE OF CASTRO MARQUIS OF NOVARA AND FINALLY DUKE OF PARMA AND PIACENZA IN 1545
ALSO THAT IF I WISHED TO ACT ARIGHT I OUGHT TO THROW UP EVERYTHING AND NOT TO STAND AGAINST A POPE IN THE PARTY OF THOSE HARE-BRAINED RADICALS
THEN HE ASKED THE GOVERNOR IF HE HAD SEEN THE WORK
3 THE MAN ARGUED
I AM AN UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN WHO WHILE ESCAPING FROM A WINDOW IN A LOVE-ADVENTURE HAVE FALLEN AND BROKEN MY LEG
THE CROWD OF MEN THOU SEEST IN THIS PLACE ARE ALL THOSE WHO UP TO THIS DAY HAVE BEEN BORN AND AFTERWARDS HAVE DIED UPON THE EARTH. THEREUPON I ASKED HIM WHY HE BROUGHT ME HITHER AND HE ANSWERED
AND HE MET ME WITH A GLAD FACE ENTREATING ME TO REGARD HIM AS A BROTHER AND SAYING THAT HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK ABOUT THAT WORK AGAIN SINCE HE RECOGNISED QUITE WELL THAT I WAS RIGHT
FOR THE SEASON WAS FINE IN EARLY SUMMER AND THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH I TRAVELLED AND WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE STRUCK ME AS MARVELLOUSLY BEAUTIFUL
I ONLY TOLD HIS MESSENGERS
XXXIX AS I HAVE JUST SAID HIS MAJESTY AFFECTED TO CONCUR WITH THE CARDINAL BUT HIS OWN PRIVATE MIND WAS OTHERWISE MADE UP
THE JUPITER WAS NEARLY FINISHED AND THE VASE ALSO
PERCEIVING WHICH WHEN THE SUPPER HAD COME TO AN AGREEABLE END I TOOK LUIGI ASIDE AND CONJURED HIM BY THE BENEFITS HE SAID HE OWED ME TO HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH HER
HE DIED AT AMBOISE IN 1556

5 PERSONALLY HE WAS GAY AND MERRY BE TEMPERAMENT
3 ACCORDINGLY AS SOON AS THEY RETURNED THE RED CROSS WAS SCRATCHED OUT AND ON THE SCUTCHEON THE RED BALLS AND THE GOLDEN FIELD WERE PAINTED IN AGAIN AND FINISHED WITH GREAT BEAUTY
AND THEN EXPERIENCE SHALL TEACH YOU WHAT PROFIT I SHALL GET FROM MY VASE AND WHAT YOU WILL GET FROM YOUR ORNAMENT. I ANSWERED THAT I WAS VERY GLAD INDEED TO ENTER INTO SUCH A COMPETITION WITH SO GOOD A CRAFTSMAN AS HE WAS BECAUSE THE END WOULD SHOW WHICH OF US WAS MISTAKEN
DONT WASTE TIME BENVENUTO

XIV WHEN I HAD THUS SPOKEN FIRENZUOLA WHO WAS A MAN OF HOT SPIRIT AND BRAVE TURNED TO GIANNOTTO AND SAID TO HIM
HIS DESCENDANTS RENEWED THEIR HOLD UPON THE FIEF WHICH WAS ERECTED INTO A DUCHY IN 1619
AND GAVE ME BESIDES TWENTY GOLDEN CROWNS WHICH SHE HAD IN HER BAG AND ADDED
FOR INDEED IT SEEMS LIKE BEING WITHOUT THE LIGHT OF MY EYES WHEN I DO NOT SEE YOU DAILY AS I USED TO DO
MY CELL I SEARCH PRICK BROWS AND HAIR UPRIGHT THEN TURN ME TOWARD A CRANNY IN THE DOOR AND WITH MY TEETH A SPLINTER DISUNITE
I LEFT FLORENCE AND WENT TO ROME AND FROM THERE I WROTE TO HIM
FOR COSIMO SOON KICKED DOWN THE LADDER WHICH HAD LIFTED HIM TO SOVEREIGNTY AND SHOWED HIMSELF THE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF FLORENCE
WHEN CERTAIN DECISIONS OF THE COURT WERE SENT ME BY THOSE LAWYERS AND I PERCEIVED THAT MY CAUSE HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY LOST I HAD RECOURSE FOR MY DEFENCE TO A GREAT DAGGER WHICH I CARRIED
FOR YOUR IMPRISONMENT WHICH YOU CERTAINLY UNDERWENT WITHOUT A SHADOW OF GUILT WILL HAVE BEEN FOR YOUR PERPETUAL WELFARE
AT THESE WORDS MY PRINCE WHO PERCEIVE THAT I WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH MADE A WRY FACE AND BADE ME GIVE GOOD HEED TO VALUING THE STONE AND SAYING WHAT I THOUGHT IT WORTH
MEANWHILE PUSH ON MY BASIN AND THE JUG WITH ALL THE SPEED YOU CAN
SOME POEMS OF ALLEGRETTIS SURVIVE
JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE CARDINALS RETINUE ARRIVED AND I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO TRAVEL WITH THEIR ESCORT SAFELY TO VITERBO
POOR BENVENUTO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THOSE GREAT FOLK? I COULD NOW FORM A VERY GOOD OPINION OF WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME PARTLY BY THE PLACE IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF AND ALSO BY WHAT THE MAN HAD TOLD ME
SO THAT UPON THAT DAY THE VERY FLOWER OF THE FRENCH COURT CAME TO VISIT ME
SO HE WISELY SPOKE IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE PRECISELY AS FOLLOWS
THE BATTLE RAGED THERE DESPERATELY AND THERE WAS THE DENSEST FOG IMAGINABLE
PERCEIVING AT ONCE HOW BASE THE BUSINESS WOULD BE I EXCLAIMED
THE SAME SAID ALL FLORENCE AND EVERY ONE WHO SAW THEM
WE SHALL HEAR MORE OF HIM AGAIN DURING THE SACK OF ROME
SHOULD YOU BUT HANKER AFTER SURGEONS SKILL TWILL DRAW THE SPOILED BLOOD FROM YOUR VEINS ADUST
WHEN IT CAME TO THIS I TOLD THEM THAT DUKE AND PRINCE OF FLORENCE WOULD NOT SUFFER FOLK TO BE SO INFAMOUSLY MASSACRED IN THEIR CITIES
TORRIGIANI WORKED IN FACT FOR HENRY VIII AND HIS MONUMENT TO HENRY VII
SO EARLY NEXT MORNING I MOUNTED MY HORSE AND TOOK THE ROAD FOR VENICE LEAVING IN MY SISTERS HANDS JEWELS AND ARTICLES TO THE VALUE OF NEARLY TWO THOUSAND CROWNS
GO BENVENUTO
AND SINCE HE IS COMMITTED TO MY CARE LEAVE ME TO ACT
THE CARDINAL OF FERRARA WAS THERE BECAUSE HE ALMOST ALWAYS ATE IN THE MORNING AT THE KINGS TABLE
SARGIA IS INTERPRETED SOPRACCOPERTA DEL LETTO NOTE 3
BUT I PROMISE THAT I WILL REWARD YOU IN SUCH WISE AS WILL MAKE YOU WONDER
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BEST POLICY TO SPEAK WITH THE HUMILITY I HAVE ABOVE DESCRIBED
MY DEAR SON I TOO IN MY TIME WAS A GOOD DRAUGHTSMAN
UN CONVERSO AN ATTENDANT ON THE MONKS
NOW I KNOW THAT WITH A LITTLE PATIENCE AND TIME HE WILL LIVE TO EXECUTE MORE OF HIS FINE WORKS. THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
2 THE STONE HAD BEEN CUT WITH A POINT
IN WHATEVER HOUSE YOU BE STEAL NOT AND LIVE HONESTLY. NOTE 1
AFTER THEY HAD TALKED A WHILE WITH LAMENTONE NICCOLò BENINTENDI 7 SAID
WERE IT NOT FOR MY GOOD REPUTATION AND FOR THE INNOCENCE OF THIS UNHAPPY BOY OF YOURS HERE I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE CUT YOUR THROAT WITH THE DAGGER AT MY SIDE
VARCHI AND AMMIRATO BOTH MENTION HIM AS AN EXCELLENT JEWELLER
CELLINIS WORDS MAY MEAN CAUSED A BEAST OF BURDEN TO PASS BY NOTE 2
IF NOT I SHALL MAKE YOU SEE WHAT A DESPERATE MAN IS ABLE TO DO. THESE WORDS THEY REPORTED TO THE CASTELLAN WHO GAVE THEM EXPRESS ORDERS NEVER TO GO NEAR MY BED AND WHEN THEY CAME TO ME TO COME WITHOUT SWORDS BUT FOR THE REST TO KEEP A WATCHFUL GUARD UPON ME
ONLY I HAD THAT ONE GREAT LONGING TO BEHOLD THE SPHERE OF THE SUN IF ONLY IN A DREAM
I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOUR APPOINTMENTS AND WILL GIVE YOU THE LODGINGS IN THE MINT WITH MUCH MORE THAN YOU COULD ASK FOR BECAUSE YOUR REQUESTS ARE ONLY JUST AND REASONABLE
ANTOINE LE MACON SECRETARY TO MARGARET OF NAVARRE
HE WAS WELL AWARE HOW GREATLY I HAD BEEN WRONGED
THEIR FRAGMENTS BECOMING BLUNT AND ROUNDED
I FELT SOME PLEASURE AT HAVING RID MYSELF IN SO FAIR A MANNER OF THAT ASS OF AN INNKEEPER
THEN HE ESCAPED TO THEIR GREAT SHAME AND YET THEY WERE NO INCONSIDERABLE PERSONS. NOTE 1
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE LISTENED WITH ATTENTION
E THE ARTIST WHO MADE THE DIES
BUT BEFORE THE MAN HIMSELF KNEW WHAT I HAD BEEN UP TO CROWDS OF PEOPLE STOPPED TO READ THE LINES AND LAUGHED IMMODERATELY AT THEM
THE RUDE BRUTE KEPT ROLLING HIS HEAD AND TURNING FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SHIFTING HIMSELF UPON HIS LEGS AND TWIRLING HIS ENORMOUS MOUSTACHIOS
HAVING DISMOUNTED I WENT TO COURT IN ORDER TO PAY MY REVERENCE TO THE DUKE AND GAIN PERMISSION TO DEPART NEXT MORNING FOR LORETO
2 THIS BISHOP HAD A NEPHEW CALLED MESSER GIOVANNI
1 WHEN I EXHIBITED THIS PIECE TO HIS MAJESTY HE UTTERED A LOUD OUTCRY OF ASTONISHMENT AND COULD NOT SATIATE HIS EYES WITH GAZING AT IT
IT HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID TO POPE CLEMENT BY ONE OF HIS MOST TRUSTED SERVANTS AND BY OTHERS THAT IS BY FRANCESCO DEL NERO ZANA DE BILIOTTI HIS ACCOUNTANT THE BISHOP OF VASONA AND SEVERAL SUCH MEN
BUT THE STREET IN WHICH POMPEOS HOUSE STOOD WAS THE ONE WHICH LEADS STRAIGHT TO THE CAMPO DI FIORE
I OUGHT TO SAY THAT HE HAD A PUNK OF HIS THERE AND WAS GOING ON WITH HIS STUPID RIBALDRIES TO AMUSE HER
TIS TRUE THAT IN HIS YOUTHFUL YEARS OUR FRIEND HATH FLOWN AND LEFT US HERE TO GRIEF
BUT SINCE WE WERE PERPETUALLY DAY AND NIGHT TOGETHER EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS A FIRST-RATE CRAFTSMAN
AND THEY WERE FAR MORE PLEASING TO THE EYE THAN THE TURKISH
LEAVING MY HOME IN A HURRY ARMED HOWEVER AS USUAL I WALKED RAPIDLY THROUGH STRADA GIULIA TOWARD THE PALAZZO FARNESE NOT EXPECTING TO MEET ANYBODY AT THAT HOUR OF DAY
MEANWHILE I HAD PAID MY DUTY TO THE CARDINAL HIS BROTHER WHO BEGGED THE DUKE TO ALLOW ME TO MAKE THE PONTIFICAL SEAL OF HIS MOST REVEREND LORDSHIP
WHEN THE FELLOW HEARD THIS HE GOT A LITTLE FOWLING-PIECE OF HIS READY WITH WHICH HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO HIT A PENNY IN THE MIDDLE
QUESTO FU QUELLO CHE THIS MAY BE NEUTER
TO WHOM AFTER MANY ENTREATIES I REPLIED
2 ALTHOUGH I HAD THE GREATEST DESIRE TO FINISH THE VASE I HAD BEGUN YET SINCE MUSIC HAS A WONDROUS CHARM OF ITS OWN AND ALSO BECAUSE I WISHED TO PLEASE MY OLD FATHER I CONSENTED TO JOIN THEM
I HAD RESOLVED THE QUESTION AND THOUGHT THAT I WAS DOOMED
IF YOU ARE DISPOSED TO WORK FOR ME I WILL TREAT YOU IN A WAY THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU PROVIDED THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOURS GIVE ME SATISFACTION OF WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT. I POOR UNHAPPY MORTAL BURNING WITH DESIRE TO SHOW THE NOBLE SCHOOL 2 OF FLORENCE THAT AFTER LEAVING HER IN YOUTH I HAD PRACTISED OTHER BRANCHES OF THE ART THAN SHE IMAGINED GAVE ANSWER TO THE DUKE THAT I WOULD WILLINGLY ERECT FOR HIM IN MARBLE OR IN BRONZE A MIGHTY STATUE ON HIS FINE PIAZZA
MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY INTO FRANCE WERE MADE
AFTERWARDS I REACHED FERRARA WITH MY THREE HORSES AND NO OTHER COMPANY
AND HENCEFORWARD I SHALL KNOW YOU FOR A SCULPTOR OF LIKE QUALITY
BENVENUTO DO YOUR BEST TO BE AN HONEST MAN AS YOU HAVE DONE UNTIL NOW
SO I TOOK IT IN HAND AND WHEN MICHEL AGNOLO SAW IT HE PRAISED ME TO THE SKIES
I FEEL MORE ILL THAN I EVER DID IN ALL MY LIFE AND VERILY BELIEVE THAT IT WILL KILL ME BEFORE A FEW HOURS ARE OVER
IN ADDITION TO THEIR ATTEMPT UPON MY LIFE BY POISONING AND THEIR NUMEROUS ROBBERIES I NOTICED THAT THE PROPERTY YIELDED LESS THAN HALF WHAT HAD BEEN PROMISED
HE REPEATED
AFTER TWO MONTHS SHE WROTE TO ME THAT SHE WAS IN SICILY EXTREMELY UNHAPPY
IT WAS UNCOVERED IN 1534 AND DUKE ALESSANDRO HAD TO IMPRISON ITS LAMPOONERS
BATTISTA DEL TASSO MY COMRADE DID NOT STAY LONG IN ROME BUT WENT BACK TO FLORENCE
HE HAD MADE THE MODEL FOR A SAMSON WITH FOUR FIGURES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FINEST MASTERPIECE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
I REFRESHED MYSELF AND HAVING RECOVERED MY VITAL SPIRITS FOUND THAT MY EXASPERATION HAD DEPARTED FROM ME
BUT I PAID THEM BECAUSE THE CARDINAL TOLD ME TO BE WELL UPON MY GUARD IF I WANTED TO PRESERVE MY LIFE ADDING THAT HAD HE NOT EXTRACTED ME THAT EVENING FROM THE PRISON I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT OUT
SHE PUT EVERY IRON INTO THE FIRE WHICH SHE COULD THINK OF IN ORDER TO STIR UP MISCHIEF AGAINST ME
SUCH AS I AM LADY I SHALL EVER BE MOST READY TO SERVE YOU. THE GENTLEWOMAN ALSO SLIGHTLY BLUSHING SAID
THIS WAS ONE EVENING FOUR HOURS AFTER NIGHTFALL AND THE POPE HAD ORDERED MESSER LATINO JUVENALE TO SEE THAT I HAD MONEY PAID TO ME NEXT MORNING
IN THE MEANWHILE WE WILL THINK OF GIVING YOU THE WHEREWITHAL TO EXECUTE SOME FINE WORKS OF ART FOR US. NOTE 1
SO HE BEGGED THE REVERSION OF IT FROM HIS MOST HOLY FATHER AND ASKED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE MONEY MADE OUT TO HIMSELF
THE FELLOW COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN A BETTER WAY THAN THIS TO MAKE US KNOW THAT HE WAS BORN A SIENESE. AFTER THAT HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID
1 OVER THIS THERE LAY A CRUST OF PLASTER ABOUT THE EIGHTH OF A CUBIT IN THICKNESS CAREFULLY MODELLED FOR THE FLESH OF THE COLOSSUS
THE TROUBLE WAS SO SERIOUS THAT I EXPECTED FOR CERTAIN TO BE LEFT WITHOUT MY EYESIGHT
YOU SHOW YOUR GREATNESS ONLY THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES WE GIVE YOU
HE WISHED BESIDES TO PAY HIS VALIANT CAPTAIN THIS COMPLIMENT
AT THE FIRST SHOT I SHALL BRING THAT FELLOW DOWN
1 IT WAS BROAD AND VERY DEEP SPANNED BY A LONG NARROW BRIDGE WITHOUT RAMPARTS
FROM ENGLAND HE WENT TO SPAIN WHERE HE MODELLED A STATUE OF THE VIRGIN FOR A GREAT NOBLEMAN
FANCYING IT WAS A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH I SET OFF RUNNING FOR MY BEDROOM WAS AT THE DISTANCE OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PACES
AND THEREFORE MY DOG KNOWS HIM; THEN I LOOSED THE DOG WHO FLEW AGAIN UPON THE ROBBER
SO I HAD THE MOUTHS OF MY MOULD IMMEDIATELY OPENED AND AT THE SAME TIME DROVE IN THE TWO PLUGS WHICH KEPT BACK THE MOLTEN METAL
INSTEAD OF KILLING HIM I GIVE HIM LIFE AND LIBERTY
INTO THIS I MOVED TOGETHER WITH MY BROTHER AND APPLIED MYSELF TO LABOUR FOR THE SPACE OF SEVERAL MONTHS
BUT I WAS WEARYING TO LEAVE FERRARA AND GET AWAY FROM ALL ITS FOLK
THEY FLUNG ME A WRETCHED MATTRESS OF COURSE HEMP GAVE ME NO SUPPER AND LOCKED FOUR DOORS UPON ME
I TAKE PRIDE IN HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY AND AM NOT MOVED BY AVARICE
CENCIO RETURNED EXCLAIMING
NOW TO GO BACK TO THE POINT FROM WHICH I STARTED HE IMPROVED IN PERSON DURING THOSE FEW MONTHS AND GAINING IN FLESH BECAME THE HANDSOMEST YOUTH IN ROME
THE MASTIO OR MAIN BODY OF HADRIANS MAUSOLEUM WHICH WAS CONVERTED INTO A FORTRESS DURING THE MIDDLE AGES
2 AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY MY FATHER DID NOT DISDAIN TO FOLLOW THIS PROFESSION AND HIS CHIEF DESIRE WITH REGARD TO ME WAS ALWAYS THAT I SHOULD BECOME A GREAT PERFORMER ON THE FLUTE
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DUKE WHO MANFULLY DEFENDED ME I SHOULD HAVE PAID DEARLY FOR MY DARING
A BROTHER OF THE CARDINAL AND HIMSELF MARQUIS OF MASSA
I ADDED MUCH ABOUT FUTURE FAVOURS IN THE FORM OF A MESSAGE FROM THE DUKE
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WHEN IT IS THROWN OPEN TO SPACE AND LIGHT IT WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT IT DOES IN THIS ENCLOSURE. I REPLIED WITH ALL HUMILITY TO HIS EXCELLENCY
BUT CELLINI WROTE THAT THE WORLD MIGHT KNOW AFTER HE WAS DEAD WHAT A FELLOW HE HAD BEEN
OR AS SOME COMMENTATORS INTERPRET FROM THE POINTS MADE BY SCULPTORS ON THEIR MARBLE BEFORE THEY BLOCK THE STATUE OUT
BUT THAT I OUGHT TO BE MUCH UPON MY GUARD AGAINST OTHERS SEEING I WAS IN THE GREATEST PERIL FOR FOLK OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE HAD SWORN TO HAVE MY LIFE
FOR HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT I SHOULD EXECUTE A LARGE PIECE OF GOLDEN PLATE
AND WOULD TO GOD THAT I HAD DONE SO
I MUTTERING ALL THE WHILE IT WAS A SLAP AND NOT A BLOW, WITH WHICH WE LEFT THE EIGHT BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER
XCIX WHEN WE HAD CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SIMPLON WE CAME TO A RIVER NEAR A PLACE CALLED INDEVEDRO
YES THESE MEN WHO ASK FOR NOTHING FEEL THAT THEIR MASTERPIECES CALL ALOUD FOR RECOMPENSE
POSSESSING SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LATIN TONGUE HE PUT A LEGEND IN LATIN ROUND HIS LOOKING-GLASS TO THIS EFFECT-WHITHERSOEVER THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE TURNS VIRTUE STANDS FIRM UPON HER FEET: ROTA SUM
IN ROME THIS KIND OF ILLNESS IS VERY PARTIAL TO THE PRIESTS AND ESPECIALLY TO THE RICHEST OF THEM
AND ONE DAY OBSERVING ME MORE DOWNCAST AND OUT OF TRIM THAN WAS PROPER HE CRIED ALOUD
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY
IF THEN IT COMES TO MY EARS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THIS TO THE KING OR ANYBODY ELSE I VOW THAT I WILL KILL YOU
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT ITS WATER WAS NOT QUITE TRANSPARENT FOR WHICH REASON IT HAD BEEN CROPPED
FOR AS I HAD TOLD THE DUKE IT IS THE NATURE OF FIRE TO ASCEND
THE FLORENTINE CITIZENS AT THIS TIME STILL WORE THEIR ANCIENT CIVIL DRESS OF THE LONG GOWN AND HOOD CALLED LUCCO NOTE 3
HIS NAME WAS GIOVANNI AND HE CAME FROM FIRENZUOLA IN LOMBARDY A MOST ABLE CRAFTSMAN IN LARGE VASES AND BIG PLATE OF THAT KIND
PUT ALL YOUR ARMS ASIDE. WHEN THEY HAD DONE SO HE ADDED
HE WAS CALLED GIOVANNI
NOT INDEED THAT THE STARS CONSPIRE TO DO US GOOD OR EVIL BUT THE EFFECT RESULTS FROM THEIR CONJUNCTIONS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBORDINATED
I THEN BEGGED HIS EXCELLENCY TO GIVE ME THE NECESSARY MEANS FOR FINISHING IT SAYING THAT I MEANT TO MAKE A PRESENT OF IT TOGETHER WITH THE LITTLE MODEL TO HIS HIGHNESS
UN FIASCO HOLDING MORE THAN A QUART
2 THEN SUDDENLY AWAKING TO THE FACT THAT I WAS STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF SO GREAT A DUKE I TURNED SUBMISSIVELY TO HIS EXCELLENCY AND SAID
I LET HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST MIND HIS ART AND THAT IF GOD SET ME A LARGE AGAIN I WOULD CERTAINLY RECALL HIM
BUT HE HAD NO TASTE FOR STATUARY AND THEREFORE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ITS CONDITIONS
E TO ESCAPE EITHER BEING DROWNED OR SHOT
THIS HORSE WAS CARRYING A PAIR OF SADDLE-BAGS WHICH CONTAINED ALL MY MONEY AND OTHER VALUABLES
9 I REPLIED BY GIVING HIM THE LIE DIRECT AND DRAWING MY SWORD
AND LET HIM TAKE CARE THAT I DO NOT SET EYES UPON THE LAD IN HIS HOUSE
BENVENUTO IF YOU WANT TO FINISH THE STATUE YOU SHALL LACK FOR NOTHING. THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
AND IN MY WILL ILL HAVE IT WRITTEN THAT NONE SHALL DEMAND OF HIM THE HEAVY DEBT FOR HIS EXPENSES HERE WHICH HE WOULD ELSEWISE HAVE TO PAY. THIS THE POPE HEARD AND TOOK IT VERY ILL INDEED
I SHOULD BE ADMITTED ON THE INSTANT WHEN SHE HAD DISCHARGED HER EMBASSY
FECE UNA ISTROMBAZZATA DI COREGGE CON TANTA ABUNDANZIA DI MERDA LXV AS WE WERE IN THE HABIT OF MEETING DAILY THE NECROMANCER KEPT URGING ME TO JOIN IN HIS ADVENTURE
XX I SHALL NOW PROCEED WITH THE NARRATION OF MY LIFE
SO THEN I WILL MAKE A BEGINNING BY SAYING HOW IT PLEASED GOD I SHOULD BE BORN
OWN BROTHER TO THE MAN YOU SEE THERE. WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR MORE HE MADE HASTE FOR TORRE DI NONA
I BEG YOU THEREFORE TO ASSIST ME FOR I CANNOT PUT THE SAME TRUST IN ANY OF YOUR COMPANIONS
NEVERTHELESS I INSPIRED SUCH TERROR THAT NO ONE DARED TO HELP MY ANTAGONIST
ON TAKING LEAVE HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO BUT HELD ME WITH HIS LITTLE HANDS AND A TEMPEST OF CRIES AND TEARS
MY BENVENUTO THEY SAY IN ROME THAT THE POPE HAS BESTOWED ON YOU AN OFFICE WITH AN INCOME OF FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS
COMMIT THYSELF UNTO HIS GUIDANCE AND LOSE NOT HOPE IN HIS GREAT GOODNESS! MUCH MORE HE ADDED IN WORDS OF MARVELLOUS EFFICACY THE THOUSANDTH PART OF WHICH I CANNOT NOW REMEMBER
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL NOT USE YOUR INFLUENCE EITHER AGAINST OR FOR THE MODELS WHICH THE DUKE HAS ORDERED TO BE MADE OF THE NEPTUNE FOR THAT GREAT BLOCK OF MARBLE. SHE REPLIED WITH MIGHTY INDIGNATION
AND YOUR HOLINESS SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT I NEVER ASKED FOR THE PLACE WITH THE HOPE OF GETTING IT
BUT I COULD NOT SEE HOW IT WAS EASY TO SECURE MYSELF AND MY COMPANION
HE APPEARED SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE TO BE A VERY HONEST LAD FOR I NOTICED HIM TO BE DEVOUT AND WHEN I HEARD HIM SOMETIMES MUTTERING PSALMS AND SOMETIMES TELLING HIS BEADS I RECKONED MUCH UPON HIS FEIGNED VIRTUE
THE OTHER WAS LEFT HANGING FROM THE KEEP OF THE CASTLE
I THOUGHT FOR CERTAIN I MUST LOSE THE SIGHT OF THAT EYE
HE TOLD ME AT ONCE HOW HE HAD SHOWN HIS BRONZE BUST TO MICHEL AGNOLO AND HOW THE LATTER HAD PRAISED IT
I WOULD NOT SUFFER THEM TO FINISH ALL THEIR SPEECHES BUT ANSWERED
WHILE I MAINTAINING A FIRM CARRIAGE SHOWING NEITHER MIRTH NOR ANGER THOUGH I FELT IT PLACED MY TWO HEADS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE JUPITER
ACCORDINGLY I SET MYSELF WITH INDEFATIGABLE INDUSTRY TO THE COMPLETION OF THE VASE I HAD BEGUN FOR SALAMANCA
THEN I REFLECTED WHAT DIVINE GRACE IT WAS WHICH GOD HAD GRANTED ME THAT MORNING AND CRIED ALOUD
PETERS DAYS
TO THE NECROMANCER HIS COMRADE HE GAVE THE PENTACLE TO HOLD
AFTER LISTENING THROUGH SEVERAL HOURS HE ROSE SO PROUD AND HAPPY IN HIS HEART THAT HE TURNED TO HIS ATTENDANT MESSER SFORZA AND EXCLAIMED
THE NEXT DAY FOLLOWING I WENT BACK SOUND AND WITH GOOD CHEER TO ROME
IT IS APPARENT MY LORDS OF WHAT VAST CONSEQUENCE ARE THE SONS OF KINGS AND EMPERORS AND WHAT A MARVELLOUS BRIGHTNESS OF DIVINITY APPEARS IN THEM
IF THE EMPEROR HAD PUSHED FORWARD AT THIS TIME HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE TAKEN PARIS
THE POPE FLEW INTO A BESTIAL PASSION AND SWORE HE WOULD WAIT TO SEE IF I WAS SO MAD AS NOT TO FINISH IT
THEREFORE TAKE HEED TO LIVING AS LONG AS YOU ARE ABLE AND KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR YOU HAVE NEED OF IT
ALESSANDRO FARNESE DEAN OF THE SACRED COLLEGE AND AFTERWARDS POPE PAUL III
5 BUT SINCE YOUR EXCELLENCE ENCOURAGES MY MODEL WITH SUCH PRAISE I FEEL THE HEART TO EXECUTE IT AT LEAST THRICE AS WELL IN BRONZE. 6 NO SLIGHT DISPUTE AROSE UPON THIS DECLARATION
WHEN I TRIED TO POINT OUT THESE DEFECTS THE DUKE INTERRUPTED ME AND EXCLAIMED WITH FURY
AT TABLE THE CONVERSATION TURNED ENTIRELY UPON MY ACT OF DARING
THEN I MADE A LITTLE WAXEN MODEL OF THE COVER
1 IT WAS BUILT OF BRICKS SO INTERLACED THE ONE ABOVE THE OTHER THAT NUMEROUS APERTURES WERE LEFT FOR THE FIRE TO EXHALE AT
HIS FINE INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES WON MY ADMIRATION
ATTEND TO ME
ALSO I CAUSED BOARDS CARPETS AND OTHER HANGINGS TO BE SET UP AGAINST THE GARDEN IN ORDER TO PROTECT US FROM THE VIOLENCE OF THE RAIN
MESSER LUIGI HAD SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD FASHION A VENUS WITH CUPID SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF PRETTY EMBLEMS ALL IN PROPER KEEPING WITH THE SUBJECT
FRANCESCO SAID TO ASCANIO
MY DISPOSITIONS WERE ALL FIXED
THE WHOLE OF THIS COMPOSITION WAS ENCLOSED IN AN OBLONG EACH ANGLE OF WHICH CONTAINED A VICTORY IN BAS-RELIEF HOLDING TORCHES AFTER THE MANNER OF THE ANCIENTS
BUT THE THIEF HAS LEFT US NAKED TO THE SHIRT BECAUSE LAST NIGHT BY REASON OF THE BURNING HEAT WE TOOK OUR CLOTHES OFF IN THE SHOP AND LEFT THEM HERE. RECOVERING MY SENSES I THANKED GOD AND SAID
BUT RECOGNISING HIS TALENTS AND WISHING TO KEEP HIM NEAR OUR PERSON WE HAD INTENDED TO TREAT HIM SO WELL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO REASON TO RETURN TO FRANCE
ACCORDINGLY HE LAID HIS HANDS AT ONCE UPON A BLOCK OF MARBLE AND PRODUCED THE PIETà WHICH MAY BE SEEN IN THE CHURCH OF THE ANNUNZIATA
BUT JUST THEN THE FELLOW IN THE ACT OF READJUSTING HIS CAPE LET FALL SOME PAPER PACKETS FROM THE HOOD WHICH DONNINO RECOGNISED AS HIS PROPERTY
I HAVE GOT YOUR LETTER HERE WHICH YOU WROTE TO BID ME COME. SANSOVINO REJOINED THAT MEN OF HIS SORT MEN OF WORTH AND GENIUS WERE FREE TO DO THAT AND GREATER THINGS BESIDES
IN 1557 IT WAS CEDED BY PHILIP II
MAESTRO GIOVANNI THE MAJORITY OF MEN WHEN THEY GROW OLD GO MAD AT THE SAME TIME
THEN HE ASSIGNED OUR SEVERAL FUNCTIONS
WITH THIS I TOOK MY LEAVE AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT ME SUCH A VERY LIBERAL PRESENT THAT I WAS WELL CONTENT
I WENT TO THE DUKE WHOM I FOUND IN BED FOR THEY TOLD ME HE WAS SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCE OF A DEBAUCH
AND THUS I REMAINED AWHILE
AND FINDING THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH ME OUT ON ANY SIDE HE FELL AT LAST UPON THIS PLAN WHICH MEANT MISCHIEF
FOR THE REST I WAS ILL-CONTENTED AND PUT TO CONSIDERABLE LOSSES
1 AS I DID NOT WANT TO TRENCH UPON HIS EXCELLENCY FOR MONEY OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM FRANCE TWO JEWELS WITH WHICH I BEGGED HIM TO PURCHASE ME THE HOUSE AND TO KEEP THEM UNTIL I EARNED IT WITH MY LABOUR
XLIX THE GUARD WAS NOW ABOUT FIFTY PACES FROM US
HE IS A YOUNG MAN OF ADMIRABLE TALENTS AND SUPPORTS HIS POOR FAMILY BY HIS LABOUR IN GREAT ABUNDANCE
AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STICK AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING-GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT
GIOVANNI ANGELO MONTORSOLI ENTERED THE ORDER OF THE SERVITES IN 1530
HE THEREFORE THOUGHT OF A GOOD EXPEDIENT FOR SENDING ME AWAY AND SPOKE TO ME AS FOLLOWS
AND TO END THE AFFAIR THEY SET ABOUT TO CONTRIVE MY DEATH
YET OTHERS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE WERE ALWAYS COMING IN
I HAD TWO YOUNG SERVING-LADS AND BENEATH MY LODGINGS LIVED A LAUNDRESS WHO COOKED EXTREMELY NICELY FOR ME
THEN UPON THE FOLLOWING MORNING I TRAVELLED FORWARD WITH THE COMPANY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED NOR COULD I THROUGH THE WHOLE JOURNEY REFRAIN FROM SIGHING AND WEEPING
LXXXVI THERE WAS ON GUARD AT THE GATE OF PRATO A CERTAIN LOMBARD CAPTAIN
ONE CAUGHT UP A PARTISAN FROM THE RACK WHICH STOOD THERE THE OTHER SEIZED THE SPONTOON OF HIS FATHER
YET HE REPLIED WITH GREAT KINDNESS
FOR BENVENUTO HAS TOLD US THAT THIS BEING HIS FIRST ARREST HE DESERVED NO CATCHPOLES OF INFERIOR STATION THAN WE ARE. IMMEDIATELY ON LEAVING US THEY SOUGHT THE POPE
