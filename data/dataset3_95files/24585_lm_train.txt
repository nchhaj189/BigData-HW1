DICKERSON'S NEAR FLOYD
I HAVE BUILT A CHURCH WHEREIN TO WORSHIP ALMIGHTY GOD AND IF HE SEES FIT TO DESTROY IT BY LIGHTNING LET HIM STRIKE THERE WAS A CHURCH STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IN NEW JERSEY WHERE THE BIG TRUST MAGNATES MET FOR WORSHIP AND THE LORD IS EXCUSED FOR VISITING IT WITH LIGHTNING
IF THIS HAD OCCURRED TO THE YOUNGERS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD GOOD HOMES IN MISSOURI IT IS TO MAJOR FOSTER'S SURPRISE OF THE COMMAND AT LONE JACK THAT KANSAS CITY OWES ITS ESCAPE FROM BEING THE SCENE OF A HARD BATTLE AUGUST 17 1862
AND YET IMPRISONMENT HAS BROUGHT OUT THE EXCELLENCIES OF MANY MEN
HEDBECK MORRILL WITHROW AND JENNER CHANCE HAVE BEEN MOST EARNEST IN THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP OF OUR CAUSE
THE BOY WHO WEARS OUT THE SEAT OF HIS TROUSERS HOLDING DOWN DRY-GOODS BOXES ON THE STREET CORNERS WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
QUANTRELL GEORGE TODD AND MYSELF ATTIRED AS UNION OFFICERS WENT TO HAMILTON A SMALL TOWN ON THE HANNIBAL AND ST JOSEPH RAILROAD UNDETECTED BY THE COMPANY OF THE SEVENTH UNITED STATES CAVALRY IN CAMP THERE ALTHOUGH WE PUT UP AT THE PRINCIPAL HOTEL
NOW I AM A LECTURER NOT A MINISTER BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK IT IS A WISE PLAN TO LET THE LORD HAVE HIS OWN WAY WITH YOU
DODD WHO WAS THEN CONNECTED WITH THE PRISON WHILE HIS WIFE WAS MATRON AND WHO STILL LIVES IN BUFFALO MINN SAID OF OUR BEHAVIOR THAT NIGHT
THERE WERE REASONS WHY THE JAMES AND THE YOUNGER BROTHERS COULD NOT TAKE PART IN ANY SUCH PROJECT AS THAT AT NORTHFIELD
WHILE IN WASHINGTON ATTENDING TO SOME BUSINESS REGARDING THIS MATTER A RAID WAS MADE BY THE KANSAS JAYHAWKERS UPON THE LIVERY STABLE AND STAGE LINE FOR SEVERAL MILES OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE ROBBERS ALSO LOOTING HIS STORE AND DESTROYING HIS PROPERTY GENERALLY
THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE AND AMONG THE PIONEERS ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF MISSOURI
MEANWHILE WE WERE PLANNING TOO
AN AWFUL PROVOCATION DROVE HIM INTO THE ARMY
HE WILL JUST BE A NICE BREAKFAST SPELL COL
HE COULD NOT RUN AND HE HAD NO KNIFE TO CUT THE LEATHER
THE OUTLAW IS LIKE A BIG BLACK BIRD FROM WHICH EVERY PASSERBY FEELS LICENSED TO PLUCK A HANDFUL OF FEATHERS
WE'RE FRIENDS CAME THE ANSWER BUT I SAW THEY WERE NOT AND THE LIEUTENANT IN COMMAND FELL AT THE FIRST FIRE
SOME PRIVATE HISTORY EVERY BLOOD-AND-THUNDER HISTORY OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS DECLARES THAT FRANK AND JESSE JAMES WERE THE TWO MEMBERS OF THE BAND THAT ENTERED NORTHFIELD WHO ESCAPED ARREST OR DEATH
THOSE WOUNDS I RECEIVED WHILE WEARING THE GRAY I'VE EVER BEEN PROUD OF AND MY REGRET IS THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE THE REST OF THEM DURING THE WAR WITH SPAIN FOR THE FREEDOM OF CUBA AND THE HONOR AND GLORY OF THIS GREAT AND GLORIOUS REPUBLIC
BUT THERE IS A DAY COMING WHEN THE SECRETS OF ALL HEARTS WILL BE LAID OPEN BEFORE THAT ALL-SEEING EYE AND EVERY ACT OF OUR LIVES WILL BE SCRUTINIZED
MOTHER SAYS YOU'VE MADE A MAN OF FATHER CAPTAIN WHITE HAD CROSSED THE RIVER QUIT HIS DRINKING ASSOCIATES BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE THE DAY WE SHOT IT OUT
IN INTREPIDITY HE WAS NEVER SURPASSED
BROTHER AND I STAYED AT WM
MULLIGAN AND HIS COMMAND
I WAS THE SEVENTH
HE TOOK IT TO HEART AND NEVER REGAINED HIS CHEERFUL MOOD FOR WHEN HE WAS UP HE WAS AWAY UP AND WHEN DOWN AWAY DOWN
JIM WHITE AND J
AND NOW WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL CLOSE WITH A BIT OF VERSE FROM RENO THE FAMOUS POET-SCOUT
BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WOMEN WERE KILLED
WELL ASBURY I SAID I'M GOING TO BE DOWN BESIDE THE WAGON WHERE I CAN SEE YOU AND YOU CAN SEE ME AND WHEN I GIVE YOU THE SIGN YOU KNOCK THE PROPERTY DOWN OR I'LL HAVE USE FOR THIS PISTOL I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO COACH MRS HURLEY SO SHE MADE IT SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING FOR ASBURY
A MAN IS KNOWN BY THE COMPANY HE CAN NOT GET INTO BUT TRULY THIS WOULD BE A BARREN WORLD WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATION OF FRIENDS
LAWRENCE WAS FOLLOWED BY A FEVERISH DEMAND FROM THE NORTH FOR VENGEANCE
HE ASSURED ME HE WOULD DO ALL HE COULD TO PROTECT ME
IF A MAN CAN NOT COME OUT OF PRISON ON HIS MERITS LET HIM REMAIN THERE
THE CAMP FIRST IT WAS A DAY OF BUTCHERY
DR PRATT WHO WAS PRISON PHYSICIAN WHEN WE WENT TO STILLWATER DR T
WE ALL CARE FOR HIM VERY DEEPLY I TOLD QUANTRELL AND THEN ASKED WHAT CHARGES WERE PREFERRED AGAINST HIM
ON PAROLE 35
A MILITIA COMMAND 300 STRONG CAME OUT TO CAPTURE US BUT THEY DID NOT RISK AN ATTACK UNTIL NEARLY MIDNIGHT
THEY LIVE AT GREENTON VALLEY LAFAYETTE COUNTY MO AND THEIR EVIDENCE WOULD BE TAKEN IN THE COURT OF HEAVEN
BOYHOOD DAYS POLITICAL HATREDS ARE ALWAYS BITTER BUT NONE WERE EVER MORE BITTER THAN THOSE WHICH EXISTED ALONG THE BORDER LINE OF MISSOURI AND KANSAS DURING MY BOYHOOD IN JACKSON COUNTY IN THE FORMER STATE FROM 1856 TO 60
QUANTRELL'S COMPANY
I KNEW COLE YOUNGER WHEN WE WERE BOYS AND ALSO HIS PARENTS
JIM GIVES IT UP 36
I MAY BE PARDONED FOR HURRYING OVER A FEW WILD RELENTLESS YEARS THAT LED UP TO A CAREER OF OUTLAWRY--A MEMORY THAT CUTS LIKE THE SWORD BLADES OF A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
DANIELS WHO WAS A DEPUTY SHERIFF WITH AN AMBITION TO SHINE AS A SLEUTH RODE OUT TO FIND JIM AND BOB AT THE SPRINGS
SOME PEOPLE EXPRESS A DESIRE TO LIVE LIFE OVER AGAIN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY COULD MAKE A BETTER SUCCESS OF IT ON A SECOND TRIP
WESTBY SAM A
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR THE WORLD THAT PUT IT UNDER OBLIGATION TO YOU
LONE JACK IT WAS IN AUGUST 1862 NEARLY A YEAR AFTER THE PARTY AT COL
AT EVERY STOPPING PLACE WE LEFT MARKS OF BLOOD FROM OUR WOUNDS AND COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY TRAILED HAD NOT THE PURSUERS BEEN LED IN THE TRACK OF OUR RECENT COMPANIONS
I DO NOT DESIRE TO POSE AS AN INSTRUCTOR FOR OTHER PEOPLE YET ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE MAY BE OF VALUE TO ANOTHER AND IT MAY NOT BE PRESUMPTUOUS FOR ME TO TELL SOME OF THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCE A TEACHER WHOSE LESSONS ARE SEVERE BUT AT LEAST WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION
AS HE QUICKLY TOLD US THE STORY WE MADE OUR PLANS AND AMBUSHED AT THE BLUE CUT A DEEP PASS ON THE ROAD THE SOLDIERS MUST TAKE BACK TO INDEPENDENCE
JUNE 3 1871 OBOCOCK BROS BANK AT CORYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF $40,000 BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
JUDY THE FATHER RETURNED TO CASS COUNTY AFTER THE WAR AS THE APPOINTIVE SHERIFF
WHAT INJUSTICE TO THE PUBLIC TO PETITION A MAN OUT OF PRISON FOR A PRICE
AFTER SIX MONTHS OF LIVING DEATH IN THIS TRAP THE HOUSE WAS SECRETLY UNDERMINED AND FELL WITH THE PRISONERS ONLY FIVE OF WHOM ESCAPED INJURY OR DEATH
I HAVE LEARNED THAT HOPE IS A DIVINITY
WILSON JAMES VAN ALLEN REV
I NEVER LIKE TO SEE A MAN A-WRESTLING WITH THE DUMPS CAUSE IN THE GAME OF LIFE HE DOESN'T ALWAYS CATCH THE TRUMPS BUT I CAN ALWAYS COTTON TO A FREE-AND-EASY CUSS AS TAKES HIS DOSE AND THANKS THE LORD IT WASN'T ANY WUSS
WE JUST SENT A RUNNER OUT TO LOOK YOU UP
CLARK WHO WAS HIS ASSISTANT AND DR B
I FOLLOWED QUANTRELL'S MEN FOR HALF A MILE FEARING THAT SOME STRAGGLERS MIGHT RETURN TO TAKE A QUIET SHOT AT ELKINS AND THEN STOPPED FOR SOMETHING TO EAT AND FED OUR HORSES
YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE FOLLOWING LINES CONTAIN MORE TRUTH THAN POETRY AND I BOW TO THE SPLENDID GENIUS OF THE AUTHOR
SMITH GAVE US MINUTE ORDERS FOR A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE COTTON THIEVES AND SPECULATORS WHO INFESTED THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BOTTOM
LIND LEAVING US THERE
EVERY ONE OF THESE WARDENS WAS OUR FRIEND AND THE DEPUTY WARDENS TOO
THE FIGHT AT CARTHAGE IN JULY 1861 FOUND QUANTRELL IN CAPT
WE DON'T WANT TO BE STARED AT AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED
FIVE MILES FROM TESTER'S FERRY ON BAYOU MACON WE MET A COTTON TRAIN CONVOYED BY 50 CAVALRY
25
WE CUT THE LINE AND FOUND THE TRAINS BUT EMPTY AND ON OUR RETURN WERE MET AT THE RIO GRANDE BY ORDERS TO DETAIL A PARTY TO CROSS THE CONTINENT ON A SECRET MISSION FOR THE CONFEDERATE STATES
I WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE THE FEMALE CONVICTS FROM THEIR CELLS AND PLACE THEM IN A SMALL ROOM THAT COULD NOT BE LOCKED
HOW MANY INDIANS WE KILLED I DO NOT KNOW AS WE HAD NO TIME OR CURIOSITY TO STOP AND COUNT THEM
TWO VESSELS OF THE ALABAMA TYPE BUILT IN BRITISH WATERS WERE TO BE DELIVERED AT VICTORIA B.C AND A SECRET SERVICE OFFICER NAMED KENNEDY WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE PAPERS WAS GIVEN AN ESCORT OF TWENTY MEN INCLUDING MYSELF CAPT
FOR A MAN WHO HAS LIVED CLOSE TO THE HEART OF NATURE IN THE FOREST IN THE SADDLE TO IMPRISON HIM IS LIKE CAGING A WILD BIRD
THE NIGHT THAT I WAS ENLISTED I WAS SENT BY COL
A FEW DAYS LATER I FILED WITH GOVERNOR VAN SANT THE FOLLOWING
THERE WERE NO SADDLE HORSES IN EVIDENCE AND WE CALCULATED THAT WE WOULD HAVE A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
JIM AND JOHN WERE AT HOME AT LEE'S SUMMIT
MCDANIELS SHOT CAPT
IT IS A LONG MARCH
I HOPE TO BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE TO MANKIND AND WILL DEDICATE MY FUTURE LIFE TO UNMASK EVERY WRONG IN MY POWER AND AID CIVILIZATION TO RISE AGAINST FURTHER PERSECUTION
SHERIFF GLISPIN SWORE WE WOULD NEVER BE MOBBED AS LONG AS WE WERE HIS PRISONERS
I SURRENDER HE HAD SHOUTED

IT WAS DURING ONE OF THOSE FIERCE CONFLICTS WHICH CHARACTERIZED EARLIER FRONTIER DAYS
IN HIS NOTED GUERRILLAS MAJ
LAURELS UNSOUGHT 21
THREE DAYS LATER PICKENS AND TWO OF HIS FRIENDS WERE FOUND DEAD ON BULL CREEK
TWO WITNESSES HAD TESTIFIED BEFORE THE GRAND JURY IDENTIFYING ME AS THE MAN WHO FIRED THE SHOT THAT HIT HIM ALTHOUGH I KNOW I DID NOT BECAUSE I FIRED NO SHOT IN THAT PART OF TOWN
ON THE CONTRARY THERE ARE ALIVE TODAY 1877 FULLY 200 FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO OWE THEIR LIVES TO COLE YOUNGER A MAN WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN CRUELLY MURDERED WHOSE MOTHER HAD BEEN HOUNDED TO HER DEATH WHOSE FAMILY HAD BEEN MADE TO ENDURE THE TORMENT OF A FEROCIOUS PERSECUTION AND WHOSE KITH AND KIN EVEN TO REMOTE DEGREES WERE PLUNDERED AND IMPRISONED
HALLER'S BODY SO MUTILATED IN THE WOODS NEAR TEXAS PRAIRIE ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF JACKSON COUNTY
JOHN MCDOWELL'S HORSE WAS KILLED UNDER HIM AND HE WOUNDED CALLED TO ME FOR HELP
ANOTHER CRIME OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED BY THE ROMANCERS THOUGH NEVER SO FAR AS I KNOW BY THE AUTHORITIES
SENATOR WILSON WHO HAD INTRODUCED THE BILL WHICH FAILED IN 1899 WAS AGAIN A STAUNCH SUPPORTER AND LED THE FIGHT FOR US IN THE SENATE
IT WAS BORN IN THE BLOOD
JIM YOUNGER JIM YOUNGER OUR FAITHFUL NEGRO SERVANT AUNT SUSE HAD BEEN HUNG UP IN THE BARN IN A VAIN ENDEAVOR TO MAKE HER REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF MY MOTHER'S SONS AND MONEY
KIRBY SMITH AT SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT
CONSEQUENTLY WHEN IN FEBRUARY 1864 GEN
PILLSBURY FIRST OFFERED $1,000 REWARD FOR THE ARREST OF THE SIX WHO HAD ESCAPED AND THIS HE CHANGED AFTERWARD TO $1,000 FOR EACH OF THEM DEAD OR ALIVE
YOU HAVE MY IDEAS OF WAR MR SECRETARY AND I AM SORRY THEY DO NOT ACCORD WITH YOUR OWN OR WITH THE IDEAS OF THE GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE THE HONOR TO REPRESENT SO WELL DISAPPOINTED CAPT
AS THE BLUE RANKS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERY SCALED THE HEIGHTS OF HEROISM AND THE SMOKE ROSE FROM THE HOT ALTARS OF THE BATTLE GODS AND FREEDOM'S WRONGS AVENGED SO THE MEMORY OF CUBA'S INDEPENDENCE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY GLORIOUS AS OUR OWN REVOLUTION--'76 AND 98--TWIN JEWELS SET IN THE CROWN OF SISTER CENTURIES
WHEN I JOINED BROTHER-IN-LAW JARRETTE'S COMPANY HE SAID
AND DULY HONORED
HIS RIGHT ARM USELESS AND HIS PISTOL EMPTY HE HAD NO CHOICE
A MORE EXCITING EXPERIENCE WAS MINE AT BAYOU MONTICELLO A STREAM THAT WAS DEEPER THAN IT LOOKED
23 1863
IT WAS FOUND ON CHARLEY WHEN HE WAS KILLED SO MUCH MORE EVIDENCE TO IDENTIFY US AS THE MEN WHO WERE IN NORTHFIELD
THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT MISSOURIANS WERE LARGELY BARRED BY LAW FROM HOLDING OFFICE AND THE STATE WAS OVERRUN WITH CARPETBAG OFFICE-HOLDERS MANY OF WHOM CAME FROM KANSAS AND DURING THE WAR HAD BEEN FREEBOOTERS AND BUSHWHACKERS UP AND DOWN THE KANSAS BORDER
HIS BROTHER JAMES DID NOT GO INTO THE WAR UNTIL 1864 AND WAS A BRAVE DAUNTLESS HIGH-SPIRITED BOY WHO NEVER KILLED A SOLDIER IN HIS LIFE SAVE IN FAIR AND OPEN BATTLE
MCCULLOCH AND IN NOVEMBER HE SENT ME WITH A VERY FLATTERING LETTER TO REPORT TO GEN
I WILL BE ON THE MOVE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
MILLER AND I WENT SECOND TO STAND GUARD AT THE BANK WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY WERE TO WAIT AT THE BRIDGE FOR THE SIGNAL--A PISTOL SHOT--IN THE EVENT THEY WERE NEEDED
WE WERE IN A STRANGE COUNTRY
PATRIOTISM SIDE BY SIDE WITH CHRISTIANITY I WOULD HAVE TO GO DOWN TO FUTURE GENERATIONS FOR WHEREVER THE CHURCH IS DESTROYED YOU ARE MAKING ROOM FOR ASYLUMS AND PRISONS
MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER ON MY FATHER'S SIDE WAS A DAUGHTER OF LIGHTHORSE HARRY LEE WHOSE PROUD MEMORY WE ALL CHERISH
WHEN WARDEN WOLFER CAME TO THE PRISON HE PUT JIM IN CHARGE OF THE MAIL AND THE LIBRARY AND I WAS SET AT WORK IN THE LAUNDRY TEMPORARILY WHILE THE NEW HOSPITAL BUILDING WAS BEING MADE READY
TO THIS DAY OLD RESIDENTS KNOW THE BLUE CUT AS THE SLAUGHTER-PEN EARLY IN MAY 1862 QUANTRELL'S MEN WERE DISBANDED FOR A MONTH
FOR TEN YEARS AND A HALF AFTER OUR ARRIVAL WARDEN REED REMAINED
AFTER CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST MY ABSOLUTE PARDON THE BOARD DECIDED AGAINST IT BUT AT A SPECIAL MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 4 1903 VOTED UNANIMOUSLY FOR A CONDITIONAL PARDON AS FOLLOWS
FINALLY A FEW DAYS LATER THE BOYS JOINED US HAVING BOUGHT THEIR HORSES AT MANKATO
I DASHED BACK AND MADE HIM GET UP BEHIND ME
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE OUTLAW WHO IN THE FAR-OFF WESTERN LAND WHERE THE SUN DIPS TO THE HORIZON IN INFINITE BEAUTY WAS THE ADOPTED SON OF THE KOOTENAI INDIANS
DEAR CURG
PROMOTION WAS RAPID
I AM TOLD HOWEVER SINCE MY RELEASE THAT IT WOULD HAVE PASSED AT THAT SESSION HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CRY OF MONEY THAT WAS USED
BUELL HIS FORCE SHOT TO PIECES SURRENDERED
DON'T KILL HIM SHOUTED THE CROWD IN RIDICULE AND JOHN FIRED SEVERAL RANDOM SHOTS TO KEEP UP THE SCARE
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE WAS WRITTEN
QUANTRELL WAS TO BE HANGED DRAWN AND QUARTERED HIS BAND ANNIHILATED
4
TO PRISON FOR LIFE 31
DON'T TALK IN GRAVEYARD PALAVER BUT SAY IT RIGHT OUT LOUD THAT GOD WILL SPRINKLE SUNSHINE IN THE TRAIL OF EVERY CLOUD
THE BOARD OF PRISON MANAGERS PROMPTLY GRANTED THE PAROLE THE PRINCIPAL CONDITIONS OF WHICH WERE AS FOLLOWS
I HATE A LIAR AND A FALSE MAN
THE BOYS ADVISED OF THEIR COMING BY A NEGRO SERVANT SOUGHT TO CONVINCE THEM AS WE HAD THE EARLIER POSSE THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE AFFAIR AT GAD'S HILL
TOO MANY MAJORS TRAVELING TOGETHER ARE LIKE TOO MANY ROSES IN A BOUQUET SUGGESTED TODD
ONE DAY EARLY IN FEBRUARY CAPT
JIM AND I HAD A HOST OF EARNEST ADVOCATES DURING THE LATTER YEARS OF OUR IMPRISONMENT BUT NONE EXCEEDED IN DEVOTION THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO AS A LITTLE TOT HAD RIDDEN UNKNOWINGLY WITH THE BANDIT WHO WAS SO SOON TO BE EXILED FOR LIFE FROM ALL HIS KIN AND FRIENDS
IN THEIR RETREAT THEY WERE REINFORCED BY 150 MORE AND RETURNED TO THE ATTACK DRIVING TODD AND HIS COMRADES BEFORE THEM
HE INTENDED TO DIE IN IT ARRAYED IN HIS ELEGANT BLACK BROAD CLOTH AND HIS WHITE SILK VEST WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS COARSE PLANK COFFIN IN THE WAGON THAT WAS TO BEAR HIM TO HIS DEATH HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BE MARRIED INSTEAD OF SHOT THE VERY GUARDS CRIED LIKE CHILDREN WHEN THEY BADE HIM GOODBYE RAISING HIS CAP AND BOWING TO THE WEEPING WOMEN WHO LINED THE STREETS HE WAS DRIVEN FROM THEIR SIGHT FOREVER HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARD SIX MUSKET BALLS HAD PIERCED HIS NOBLE HEART AND HIS WHITE SILK VEST WAS TORN AND DYED WITH HIS MARTYR BLOOD THERE WAS POOR OLD WILLIS BAKER HIS HEAD WHITENED WITH THE SNOWS OF MORE THAN SEVENTY WINTERS HEROIC OLD MAN WITH HIS WHITE HAIR STREAMING IN THE WIND HE SEATED HIMSELF ON HIS RUDE COFFIN AND DIED WITHOUT A SHUDDER
THEY WERE THERE BRIGHT AND EARLY TO SEE THAT SHE CARRIED OUT HER AGREEMENT SO LEAVING HER BURNING WALLS BEHIND HER SHE AND THE FOUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND SUSE BEGAN THEIR EIGHT MILE TRUDGE THROUGH THE SNOW TO HARRISONVILLE
RELIGIOUS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE VISITED ME IN PRISON WHO HAVE NEVER MENTIONED RELIGION BUT HAVE HAD THE STRONGEST INFLUENCE OVER ME
BUT THE CHANGE FROM THE REGULARITY OF PRISON HOURS TO THE IRREGULAR HOURS MEALS AND VARIOUS CHANGES TO WHICH THE DRUMMER IS SUBJECT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME AND I RETURNED TO ST PAUL TO ENTER THE EMPLOY OF EDWARD J
A BULLET HOLE ABOVE HIS RIGHT EAR AND A PISTOL CLUTCHED IN HIS HAND TOLD THE STORY OF SUICIDE
I TRIED TO GET MY MAN AND STARTED THROUGH BUT THE NEXT I KNEW I WAS LYING ON THE GROUND BLEEDING FROM MY NOSE AND MOUTH AND BOB WAS STANDING UP SHOUTING
30 OF THAT YEAR FROM GEN
A BOY OF 20 WILLIAM CLARKE QUANTRELL HAD JOINED HIS BROTHER IN KANSAS IN 1855 AND THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA OVERLAND WHEN A BAND OF JAYHAWKERS IN COMMAND OF CAPT
BUT ALLEN REMEMBERING THE RECENT FATE OF WHICHER DREW HIS PISTOL AND SHOT JOHN IN THE NECK
I WAS 21 AND NO MAN OF MY AGE IN MISSOURI PERHAPS HAD BETTER PROSPECTS IF I HAD BEEN UNMOLESTED
THOMAS COLEMAN YOUNGER ON READING SINCE MY RELEASE THE PRETENDED HISTORY OF MY LIFE I FIND THAT I WAS WRONG IN STATING THAT THERE WAS NO ROBBERY DURING THE SUMMER OF 1872 THE BANK AT COLUMBIA KY HAVING BEEN RAIDED APRIL 29 OF THAT YEAR
LOST--TWENTY-FIVE YEARS WHEN THE IRON DOORS SHUT BEHIND US AT THE STILLWATER PRISON I SUBMITTED TO THE PRISON DISCIPLINE WITH THE SAME UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE THAT I HAD EXACTED DURING MY MILITARY SERVICE AND JIM AND BOB I THINK DID THE SAME
I STAYED BY JOE HARDIN TILL THEY DROPPED HIM IN HIS TRACKS AND FOUGHT FIFTEEN OF THE MILITIA WHILE OTHO HINTON STOPPED TO GET HIS HEAVY BOOTS OFF
THE TRUTH ABOUT JOHN YOUNGER 22
MY PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PROMINENT POLITICALLY
THE BANKS ARE ABOUT THIRTY FEET HIGH AND THE CUT ABOUT FIFTY YARDS WIDE
THE SHORTEST RAIL LINES ARE ROUNDABOUT VIA ST JOSEPH AND KANSAS CITY SO IT WILL BE APPARENT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT THE ROCK ISLAND WRECK
I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE 8TH OF FEBRUARY 1874
IT'S HARD TO HAVE PEOPLE WRITE THINGS ABOUT YOU THAT ARE NOT TRUE AND PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH THAT YOU NEVER UTTERED IT WAS TO SUCH NEWSPAPER MEN I THINK THAT JIM SENT HIS MESSAGE BURN ME UP 36
PITTS SHOT THROUGH THE HEART LAY DEAD
MONDAY NIGHT SEPT
IT IS THEREFORE MY PURPOSE TO GIVE AN AUTHENTIC AND ABSOLUTELY CORRECT HISTORY OF THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS IN ORDER THAT I MAY IF POSSIBLE COUNTERACT IN SOME MEASURE AT LEAST THE HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF BY THE BLOOD AND THUNDER ACCOUNTS OF MISDEEDS WITH WHICH RELENTLESS SENSATIONALISTS HAVE CHARGED US BUT WHICH HAVE NOT EVEN THE SUGGESTION OF TRUTH ABOUT THEM THOUGH DOUBTLESS THEY HAVE HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH COLORING PUBLIC OPINION
NEXT MORNING I STARTED
DO YOU KNOW HIM ASKED QUANTRELL IN ASTONISHMENT
FOR A STRETCH OF THREE MILES HERE THESE BLUFFS WERE PRACTICALLY IMPASSABLE TO HORSEMEN BUT WE CLIMBED DOWN THEM AND FOUND OUR WAY TO THE HOME OF MRS MOORE WHERE WE WERE SAFE AGAIN
JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
I STAYED THERE POINTING MY PISTOL AT ANY ONE WHO SHOWED HIS HEAD UNTIL PITTS HAD GONE PERHAPS 30 OR 40 YARDS AND THEN PUTTING SPURS TO MY HORSE I GALLOPED TO WHERE HE WAS AND TOOK HIM UP BEHIND ME
I THOMAS COLEMAN YOUNGER PURSUANT TO ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH A PARDON HAS BEEN GRANTED TO ME DO HEREBY PROMISE UPON MY HONOR THAT I WILL NEVER EXHIBIT MYSELF NOR ALLOW MYSELF TO BE EXHIBITED AS AN ACTOR OR PARTICIPANT IN ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE MUSEUM CIRCUS THEATER OPERA HOUSE OR ANY PLACE OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT OR ASSEMBLY WHERE A CHARGE IS MADE FOR ADMISSION 37
BUT THIS OUTCRY DEFEATED THE BILL OF 1899
I DO NOT DESIRE TO STAND UPON THE BASIS OF THE NOTORIETY WHICH THE PAST RECORD OF MY LIFE MAY HAVE EARNED FOR ME
AMONG THESE WERE TWO FORMER GUERRILLAS WHO COMMITTED SMALL CRIMES THAT THEY MIGHT BE SENT TO PRISON AND THERE PLOT WITH US FOR OUR ESCAPE
AN AFTERWARD SINCE THE FOREGOING WAS WRITTEN I FIND THAT THE PUBLICATION OF LIBELS ON MYSELF AND MY DEAD BROTHERS CONTINUES
SOME ONE HAS SAID EVERY MAN IS WHAT GOD MADE HIM AND SOME ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE SO
ONE PUBLISHING HOUSE ALONE IS SELLING SIXTY VARIETIES OF THESE BOOKS AND I VENTURE TO SAY THAT IN THE WHOLE LOT THERE COULD NOT BE FOUND SIX PAGES OF TRUTH
I WAS MR DYKES A SOJOURNER FROM THE NORTH AND WHILE I CARRIED A PAIR OF PISTOLS IN MY BELT TO GUARD AGAINST THE APPEARANCE OF ANY OF JUDY'S ILK THE PEOPLE OF LAKE CITY NEVER KNEW IT UNTIL ONE DAY WHEN THE VILLAGE WAS THREATENED WITH A RACE RIOT
WE PROPOSE TO HAVE OUR SHOW EFFICIENTLY AND HONESTLY POLICED TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THE WORTH OF THEIR MONEY AND TO GIVE AN ENTERTAINMENT THAT WILL SHOW THE FRONTIERSMAN OF MY EARLY MANHOOD AS HE WAS
I BELIEVE HE STILL RETAINS THOSE QUALITIES AND WOULD PROVE HIMSELF AS GOOD A CITIZEN AS WE HAVE AMONG US IF SET FREE AND WOULD FIGHT FOR THE STARS AND STRIPES AS FEARLESSLY AS HE DID FOR THE SOUTHERN FLAG
TRAIN ROBBERY AT BIG SPRINGS AND IN THE OTHER OF THE CHICAGO ALTON ROBBERY AT THE MISSOURI PACIFIC CROSSING NEAR INDEPENDENCE MO
IT DOES NOT OWE YOU THE FRACTION OF A RED CENT YOUNG MAN
WHEN SHEPHERD CALLED HUDSPETH SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN AND TOLD ME WHO WAS OUTSIDE
A FARIBAULT POLICEMAN WHO THOUGHT THE MILITIA GUARD WAS A BLUFF BET FIVE DOLLARS HE COULD GO RIGHT UP TO THE JAIL WITHOUT BEING INTERFERED WITH
WE HAD BEEN IN STILLWATER PRISON NEARLY A YEAR WHEN THE BIG SPRINGS ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED IT BEING IN SEPTEMBER 1877
LAWRENCE 15
THE WARDEN CAME TO HIS CHIEF DEPUTY ABE HALL AND SUGGESTED THAT WE BE PUT IN IRONS NOT THAT HE HAD ANY FEAR ON OUR ACCOUNT BUT FOR THE EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC
I REMEMBER HOW I GLARED AT THEM HOW MY PULSE ALMOST CEASED BEATING AT SUCH DEMANDS
CAPTAIN DYKES 25
BUT WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND STOOD AT BAY
IN THE TWO STATES NAMED THESE FRIENDS ARE TOO NUMEROUS FOR ME TO MENTION EACH OF THEIR NAMES BUT AMONG THOSE IN MISSOURI WHO TRAVELED LONG JOURNEYS TO MINNESOTA TO PLEAD MY CAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT TO BE UNPOPULAR IN MANY QUARTERS I WISH TO ESPECIALLY THANK COL
YOUR YOUNG CONFEDERACY WANTS VICTORY
A NEGRO SERVANT WHO HAD WITNESSED THE SEIZURE OF HIS YOUNG MASTER HAD FLED FOR THE TIMBER AND CAME UPON A PARTY OF A DOZEN OF US INCLUDING QUANTRELL AND MYSELF
JARRETTE WAS ORDERLY SERGEANT
SHE THREW UP HER HANDS AND PUSHED ASIDE THE GUNS
VISITING FOR A TIME WITH MY UNCLE ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE I RETURNED TO JACKSON COUNTY IN THE FALL OF 1865 TO PICK UP THE SCATTERED ENDS OF A RUINED FAMILY FORTUNE
MY FATHER WAS A DIRECT DESCENDANT FROM THE LEES ON ONE SIDE AND THE YOUNGERS ON THE OTHER
NICHOLS HAD NOT KNOWN OF IT
THE WOMEN WERE AS THEY HAD SAID THE WIVES OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS
ALL THAT WINTER INDEPENDENCE WAS THE SCENE OF A BLOODY WARFARE
SINCE I AM TO SPEAK TO YOU OF SOME OF THE IMPORTANT LESSONS OF MY LIFE IT MAY BE IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU SOME ACCOUNT OF MY ANCESTRY
THE LEES CAME FROM SCOTLAND TRACING THEIR LINE BACK TO BRUCE
WRECKING THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE AS WE LEFT WE WOULD GET A GOOD START AND BY NIGHT WOULD BE SAFE BEYOND SHIELDSVILLE AND THE NEXT DAY COULD RIDE SOUTH ACROSS THE IOWA LINE AND BE IN COMPARATIVE SAFETY
THE STREETS WERE WIDE
STEWART'S COMPANY OF CAVALRY
ON THE EVE OF SIXTY I COME OUT INTO THE WORLD TO FIND A HUNDRED OR MORE OF BOOKS OF GREATER OR LESS PRETENSIONS PURPORTING TO BE A HISTORY OF THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS BUT WHICH ARE ALL NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A LOT OF SENSATIONAL RECITALS WITH WHICH THE YOUNGER BROTHERS NEVER HAD THE LEAST ASSOCIATION
I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE MAN WHO PRIDES HIMSELF ON GETTING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF EVERY PUBLIC ISSUE IS AS PERNICIOUS AN ENEMY TO THE COUNTRY AS THE MAN WHO OPENLY FIRES UPON THE FLAG
I TRAVELED FOR THE PETERSON COMPANY UNTIL NOV 1901 COVERING NEARLY ALL OF MINNESOTA
I WAS AWAY IN LOUISIANA AT THE TIME BUT ON MY RETURN SEVERAL ATTORNEYS OFFERED TO DEFEND JOHN IF HE WOULD RETURN FOR TRIAL BUT AFTER A VISIT AT THE HOME OF OUR UNCLE IN CALIFORNIA HE RETURNED TO MISSOURI IN THE WINTER OF 1873 AND 1874 JUST IN TIME TO BE SUSPECTED OF THE TRAIN ROBBERY AT GAD'S HILL ON THE IRON MOUNTAIN ROAD
HE WAS TAKEN TO THE MILITARY PRISON AT ALTON ILL AND WAS RELEASED IN THE FALL OF 1865 COMING HOME WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF MY RETURN
IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MCCOY OR A
IT WAS WHILE AT THIS THAT I SAW JESSE JAMES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE SO THAT SETS AT REST ALL THE WILD STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT OUR MEETING AS BOYS AND JOINING QUANTRELL
THERE WAS TO BE A SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND EFFECTS OF THE WIDOW HURLEY
WHEN THE WAR CEASED THOSE OF THE GUERRILLAS WHO WERE NOT HUNG OR SHOT OR PURSUED BY POSSES TILL THEY FOUND THE HAND OF MAN TURNED AGAINST THEM AT EVERY STEP SETTLED DOWN TO BECOME GOOD CITIZENS IN THE PEACEFUL WALKS OF LIFE AND THE SURVIVORS OF QUANTRELL'S BAND MAY BE PARDONED IN VIEW OF THE BLACK PAINT THAT HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THEM IN CALLING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT OF THE MEMBERS OF QUANTRELL'S COMMAND WHO HAVE SINCE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH PUBLIC PLACE NOT ONE HAS EVER BETRAYED HIS TRUST
WE WERE UP ON THE INSTANT
I REMEMBER THAT AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE IN 1884 HE WAS IN ONE OF THESE FITS OF DEPRESSION BUT THE EXCITEMENT OF THAT TIME BUOYED HIM UP AND HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD
AND AS FOR A
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS OBTAINING FROM THE CHICAGO AND ST LOUIS PAPERS AND OTHER SOURCES INFORMATION ABOUT THE NORTHERN ARMIES WHICH WAS CONVEYED BY COURIERS TO CONFEDERATE OFFICERS IN THE SOUTH AND HE KEPT CONCEALED ALONG THE MISSOURI RIVER SKIFFS AND FERRY BOATS TO ENABLE THE CONFEDERATE OFFICERS RECRUITING NORTH OF THE RIVER TO HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE SOUTH
THAT DAY MY PERSISTENT PISTOL PRACTICE SHOWED ITS WORTH WHEN ONE OF THE MILITIAMEN FELL 71 YARDS AWAY ACTUAL MEASURE
SOME MEN IN PRISON FLY TO IT AS A REFUGE IN SINCERITY--SOME OTHERWISE
WHEN THE ELECTION WAS HELD IT WAS CAPT
THERE WERE PLENTY OF HORSES IN MISSOURI BUT THE AMMUNITION PRESENTED MORE OF A PROBLEM
WE CROSSED THE RIVER AT BLUE MILLS AND WENT UP ON THE OTHER SIDE
HENRY PORTER REPRESENTED ONE OF THE JACKSON COUNTY DISTRICTS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE REMOVED TO TEXAS WHERE HE WAS MADE JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT AND IS NOW I UNDERSTAND A JUDGE OF PROBATE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

HE REJOINED ME IN FLORIDA
HE WAS A HERO AND HE WAS MERCIFUL 17
AS THEY ALWAYS DO AT ST LOUIS WHEN ON THE LOOKOUT A LOT OF DETECTIVES BOARDED THE TRAIN AT EAST ST LOUIS AND CAME THROUGH BUT I WAS BUSY SHOWING ONE OF THE SMALL BOYS THE RIVER AND BOB HAD A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS EQUALLY INTERESTED IN THE STRANGE CITY BEFORE HER
CAPTS
THOSE ESTABLISHING THEIR LOYALTY WERE PERMITTED TO GO WITHIN THE LINES OF ANY MILITARY POST OR TO KANSAS BUT ALL OTHERS WERE TO REMOVE WITHOUT THE BOUNDS OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT
I KNOW MUCH OF THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE YOUNGERS WERE PLACED AFTER THE WAR AND KNOWING THIS I HAVE GREAT SYMPATHY FOR THEM
THEIR IDEAS ON PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE VERY HAZY IN MANY CASES
THE PALMYRA BUTCHERY AS LONG AS PETE DONAN WAS THE EDITOR OF THE LEXINGTON CAUCASIAN THAT PAPER ONCE EACH YEAR PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT SUBSTANTIALLY IN THIS WISE
NEXT DAY JOHN AND I WENT TO KANSAS CITY

THERE WAS KICKING ENOUGH WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO PUT ALL THE GOODS UP IN A LUMP BUT HE LOOKED DOWN WHERE I WAS LEARNING AGAINST THE WHEEL OF HIS WAGON AND STOOD PAT
WHILE WE BARRICADED THE WINDOWS WITH BEDDING THE CAPTAIN POLLED HIS MEN
THERE IS LITTLE TO INSPIRE MIRTH IN PRISON

AS GREAT AS HAD BEEN HIS PROVOCATION HE NEVER MURDERED
ON HIS BODY TODAY THERE ARE THE SCARS OF THIRTY-SIX WOUNDS
I YANKED HIS BOOT OFF AND WE TOOK TO OUR HEELS THE MILITIA WITHIN 20 YARDS
THEY EIGHTY-FOUR
HE WAS NEVER A BLOODTHIRSTY OR A MERCILESS MAN
MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY 15 1848 JOHN IN 1851 AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER 1853
CHARACTER IS WHAT YOU REALLY ARE
CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS AND SYMPATHIZERS WERE PROHIBITED FROM PRACTICING ANY PROFESSION PREACHING THE GOSPEL ACTING AS DEACON IN A CHURCH OR DOING VARIOUS OTHER THINGS UNDER PENALTY OF A FINE NOT LESS THAN $500 OR IMPRISONMENT IN THE COUNTY JAIL NOT LESS THAN SIX MONTHS
YET HE WAS IN MANY CASES IF NOT IN MOST A MAN WHO HAD BEEN BORN TO BETTER THINGS AND WHO WAS MADE WHAT HE WAS BY SUCH OUTRAGES AS OSCEOLA PALMYRA AND A HUNDRED OTHER RAIDS LESS FAMOUS BUT NOT LESS INFAMOUS THAT WERE MADE BY KANSANS INTO MISSOURI DURING THE WAR
AT THE FIRST FIRE HIS RIGHT ARM WAS SHATTERED AT THE SHOULDER

JIM WHITE TO WHOM I HAD SENT WORD DURING THE WAR THAT WHEN I MET HIM AGAIN HE WOULD HAVE TO APOLOGIZE OR FIGHT BECAUSE OF CIRCULATING SOME SCANDAL ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN FRIEND OF MINE
SEPTEMBER 26 OF THE SAME YEAR THE CASH-BOX OF THE KANSAS CITY FAIR WAS STOLEN

AGAINST THIS IT WAS URGED THAT WHILE I WAS IN THE STATE THE BOARD COULD EXERCISE A SUPERVISION OF MY EMPLOYMENT AND MOVEMENTS WHICH IT MIGHT BE JUDICIOUS TO CONTINUE
THEY CAME UP WITH US AS WE WERE FORDING A SMALL SLOUGH AND UNABLE TO FORD IT WITH THEIR HORSES THEY WERE DELAYED SOMEWHAT BY HAVING TO GO AROUND IT
HE THOUGHT THERE WERE 75 SOLDIERS IN LAWRENCE
JUDY HAD NO LEGAL RIGHTS IN JACKSON COUNTY BUT IN SPITE OF THAT HIS POSSE STARTED FOR THE YOUNGER FARM ONE NIGHT TO TAKE ME

NEW YORK AND CHICAGO AS WELL AS ST PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS PAPERS DID NOT CONNECT THE YOUNGERS WITH THE CRIME AND THREE DAYS AFTER THE ROBBERY THESE PAPERS HAD IT THAT THE ROBBERS HAD BEEN FOLLOWED INTO NODAWAY COUNTY MISSOURI WHILE WE WERE AT MONEGAW SPRINGS ALL THAT TIME
A DAUGHTER KATE WHO WAS ASLEEP UPSTAIRS WAS RESCUED FROM THE FLAMES BY HER SISTER
THE EXCITEMENT THAT FOLLOWED OUR SENTENCE TO STATE PRISON WHICH WAS POPULARLY CALLED CHEATING THE GALLOWS RESULTED IN THE CHANGE OF THE LAW IN THAT RESPECT
THESE FAIRY TALES HAVE TOLD HOW THE CHEROKEE MAIDEN FELL IN LOVE WITH THE DASHING CAPTAIN AS A MATTER OF FACT BELLE STARR WAS NOT A CHEROKEE

M AND TOM LEA OF INDEPENDENCE MO WERE LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH ME ANY ONE OF WHOM WILL VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OF MY STATEMENT THAT I WAS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR EITHER OF THESE TOWNS AT THE TIME OF THE ROBBERIES IN QUESTION BUT WAS WITH THEM AT THE PLANTATION REFERRED TO ABOVE
WE TOOK THE WOMEN DOWN TOWN TO THE OFFICE WHERE THEY GOT THEIR REBATES ON THEIR TICKETS AND THEN WE TOOK THEM BACK TO THE DEPOT AND LEFT THEM VERY GRATEFUL FOR OUR CONSIDERATE ATTENTION ALTHOUGH PERHAPS WE WERE UNDER AS DEEP OBLIGATIONS TO THEM AS THEY WERE TO US IF THEY HAD KNOWN ALL THE FACTS

CALLED HER INTO HIS OFFICE AND TOLD HER HE WOULD SAVE HER HUSBAND IF SHE WOULD GIVE HIM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN SUBMIT--BUT OH
MANY MEN NOW PROMINENT AND USEFUL CITIZENS OF MISSOURI WERE LIKE THE YOUNGERS UNABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES UNTIL SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENT THREW THEM WITH MEN THEY HAD KNOWN BEFORE THE WAR WHO HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO MAKE EASY THEIR RETURN TO PEACE AND USEFULNESS
THE CHARACTER OF THIS MAN TO MANY HAS BEEN A CURIOUS STUDY BUT TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM WELL THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT IT OF MYSTERY OR MANY-SIDEDNESS
I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS THAT FALL AND REMAINED IN ST CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
WE SPENT A WEEK IN MINNEAPOLIS SEEING THE SIGHTS PLAYING POKER AND LOOKING AROUND FOR INFORMATION AFTER WHICH WE SPENT A SIMILAR PERIOD IN ST PAUL

BENNETT OF MINNEAPOLIS BUT ALSO FORMERLY OF KANSAS CITY
NOTHING COULD HAVE PROVED HER FAITHFULNESS MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN AN INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH ONE OF MY STOLEN VISITS HOME
HE HAS PROVIDED MAN HIMSELF WITH AN INTELLECT TO FATHOM AND DEVELOP THE MYSTERIES OF HIS HANDIWORK
ACCORDINGLY THE THREE OF US WERE PUT AT WORK MAKING BUCKETS AND TUBS WITH BEN CAYOU OVER US AS A SPECIAL GUARD WHEN IN OUR DREAMS WE HAD BEEN TRAVELING TO SOUTH AMERICA ON BEN BUTLER'S MONEY

THEY WERE ONLY TOO GLAD FOR WITH THE FAMILY OUT THE ELL WHICH WAS NOT COMMANDED BY OUR FIRE OFFERED A TEMPTING MARK FOR THE INCENDIARY
MY FRIENDS CIVILIZATION MAY BE A THIN VENEER AND THE WORLD TODAY MAY BE SLIMY WITH HYPOCRISY BUT NO MAN IS JUSTIFIED IN KILLING LIONS TO FEED DOGS
WHILE HE WAS STANDING OVER US THREATENING US WITH HIS DRAWN PISTOL THE YOUNG MAN I HAD SEEN DISTRIBUTING AMMUNITION ALONG IN FRONT OF THE CONFEDERATE LINE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM FROM THE WEST DOOR AND SEIZING THE FELLOW THRUST HIM OUT OF THE ROOM
SOME OF THE BOYS WANTED TO KILL HIM ON THE THEORY THAT DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES WHILE OTHERS URGED BINDING HIM AND LEAVING HIM IN THE WOODS
WE WERE TAKEN INTO MADELIA THAT DAY AND OUR WOUNDS DRESSED AND I GREETED MY OLD LANDLORD COL
JOHN AND MCDANIELS WENT OUT TOOK THE OFFICERS HORSES AND RODE TO MISSOURI
SIDE BY SIDE THE HORSES GALLOPED JOHN FIRING AT THE DETECTIVE TILL HE FELL FROM THE SADDLE MORTALLY WOUNDED
GATHERING UP A LOT OF THE BAGGAGE OF THE WOMEN FOLKS WE WENT THROUGH THE UNION DEPOT
IN 1874 WHEN DETECTIVE WHICHER WAS KILLED ON A TRIP TO ARREST FRANK AND JESSE JAMES I WAS ANGERED TO THINK THAT JESSE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BROUGHT WHICHER FROM KEARNEY TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RIVER WHICH I THEN BELIEVED WAS DONE TO THROW SUSPICION ON THE BOYS IN JACKSON COUNTY OF WHOM PERHAPS I WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO GET THE CREDIT
A FOUL CRIME WITH TWO BIG FARMS IN JACKSON COUNTY BESIDES MONEY-MAKING STORES AND A LIVERY STABLE AT HARRISONVILLE MY FATHER AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR WAS WEALTHY BEYOND THE AVERAGE OF THE PEOPLE IN NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI
AND WHEREAS SUCH DISCRIMINATION EVINCES A WANT OF MANLY GENEROSITY AND STATESMANSHIP ON THE PART OF THE PARTY IMPOSING AND OF COURAGE AND MANHOOD ON THE PART OF THE PARTY SUBMITTING TAMELY THERETO
MY BARBER WAS OF A DIFFERENT SCHOOL OF DARKIES AND THE LAKE CITY BLACKS DETERMINED TO RUN HIM OUT OF TOWN
DO THEY TAKE ANY PRISONERS FROM ME
PICKENS AS WAS AFTERWARDS LEARNED RAIDED THEIR CAMP NEAR THE COTTONWOOD RIVER
IN THE NEXT JANUARY 1875 A POSSE OF PINKERTON MEN AND OTHERS GUIDED BY DANIEL H
SECRETARY COOPER SUGGESTED THAT WAR HAD ITS AMENITIES AND REFINEMENTS AND THAT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IT WAS SIMPLY BARBARISM TO TALK OF A BLACK FLAG
I CONSULTED WITH OLD EX-GOVERNOR KING AT RICHMOND WHO HAD TWO SONS IN THE FEDERAL ARMY ONE OF WHOM I HAD CAPTURED DURING THE WAR ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT AT THE TIME AND WITH JUDGE TUTT OF THIS DISTRICT
HE DID NOT DREAM OF THE PRESENCE OF COCKRELL AND HIS COMMAND UNTIL HE STUMBLED UPON THEM IN LONE JACK
THE PAST IS A TRAGEDY--A TRAGEDY WHEREIN DANGER LURKS IN EVERY TRAIL
MOTHER'S HEALTH HAD FAILED PERCEPTIBLY THE RESULT IN A LARGE MEASURE OF HER EXPOSURE AT THE TIME THE MILITIA FORCED HER TO BURN HER HOUSE AND WE SOUGHT TO MAKE HER A HOME IN A MILDER CLIMATE IN THE SOUTHWEST
PEOPLE HAVE SNEERED AT MY SUCCESS AND SAID WAIT TILL CAP'N YOUNGER GETS AT YOU
THEY HAVE TALKED SO ELOQUENTLY AND EARNESTLY THAT I THOUGHT I WAS FORTUNATE TO ENLIST THE SYMPATHIES AND AID OF SUCH SPLENDID MEN
HER STORY WAS A FABRICATION INSPIRED UNDOUBTEDLY BY THE NOTORIETY IT WOULD GIVE HER THROUGH THE CHEROKEE NATION WHERE THE NAME OF YOUNGER WAS WIDELY KNOWN WHETHER FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY
THE MAN WHO WALKS WITH GOD IS IN GOOD COMPANY
BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS SO THAT THE RIDE OUT WAS INTERRUPTED BY A MOUNTED PICKET WHO GALLOPED ALONGSIDE AND AGAIN HER BRIDLE WAS SEIZED
HE TOLD ME TO GO DOWN TO THE FARM IN JACKSON COUNTY AND TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE CONFLICT THAT WALLEY WAS EVIDENTLY DETERMINED TO FORCE
DURING MY CAREER OF OUTLAWING I RODE INTO TOWN UNDER THE GLARE OF THE NOONDAY SUN AND ALL MEN KNEW MY MISSION

IT IS SOMETHING TO ONE'S CREDIT TO HAVE HAD AN ANCESTRY THAT ONE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF
MCCOY THEN I WILL BE SILENT AND NEVER MORE PLEAD INNOCENCE
WHAT WILL YOU HAVE ASKED THE APPLE-WOMAN
WE OWE THE WORLD THE BEST THERE IS IN US FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT
SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE UNLOCKED THEIR VAULTS WHEREIN POVERTY AND WEALTH ARE NOT CLASSIFIED--A FITTING THEATER WHERE THE MASTER MIND SHALL PLAY THE LEADING ROLE
THE WHITE OUTLAW HAD INFLUENCED THE RED MAN TO SEND A MESSAGE OF PEACE TO THE WHITES AND FOR THIS IMPORTANT MISSION THE LITTLE SON OF THE KOOTENAI CHIEF WAS SELECTED
HUMANITY SHUDDERS SICKENS AT THE HORRID PROPOSAL THE WRETCHED HALF-CRAZED AGONIZED WIFE NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE DID--ACCEDED TO SAVE HER HUSBAND'S LIFE--AND THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS FOUND LYING INSANE AND NEARLY DEAD WITH HER BABY AT HER BREAST NEAR THE PUBLIC SPRING AT PALMYRA AND AFTER ALL THIS HER HUSBAND WAS ONLY RELEASED ON CONDITION THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE SHOT IN HIS PLACE YOUNG SMITH WAS SELECTED AND THEN ENSUED A CONTEST WITHOUT A PARALLEL IN ALL THE SIX THOUSAND YEARS OF HUMAN HISTORY HUMPHREY REFUSED TO LET ANY MAN DIE IN HIS STEAD DECLARING HE SHOULD FEEL HIMSELF A MURDERER IF HE DID SMITH PROTESTED THAT HE WAS ONLY A POOR ORPHAN BOY AND SO FAR AS HE KNEW THERE WAS NOT A SOUL ON EARTH TO GRIEVE FOR HIM
HAYS CAMPED ON THE COWHERD WHITE HOWARD AND YOUNGER FARMS QUANTRELL HAD BEEN LEFT TO GUARD THE APPROACHES TO KANSAS CITY AND TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE TO THAT POINT OF NEWS FROM THE SCATTERED CONFEDERATE COMMANDS WHICH WERE RECRUITING IN WESTERN MISSOURI
BUT TO THE SINCERE IT IS A GREAT CONSOLATION FOR IT TEACHES MEN THAT HOPE IS A DIVINITY WITHOUT WHICH NO MAN CAN LIVE AND RETAIN HIS REASON
I WILL COME NOW TO THE STE
AT LEAVENWORTH THEY HAD ONE OF OUR BOYS NAMED HOY WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AT THE TATE HOUSE AND WE PAROLED BROWN AND SENT HIM TO LEAVENWORTH TO ASK THE EXCHANGE OF HOY
A FOUL CRIME 9
IN THE LEGISLATURE OF 1889 OUR FRIENDS ENDEAVORED TO HAVE THE PAROLE SYSTEM EXTENDED TO LIFE PRISONERS AND SECURED THE INTRODUCTION IN THE LEGISLATURE OF A BILL TO PROVIDE THAT LIFE PRISONERS MIGHT BE PAROLED WHEN THEY HAD SERVED SUCH A PERIOD AS WOULD HAVE ENTITLED THEM TO THEIR RELEASE HAD THEY BEEN SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT FOR 35 YEARS
WE HAD TAKEN HIM PRISONER AT OLATHE
THEY WERE NOT HOWEVER
GREENWOOD
FRANK JAMES AND I CAME TOGETHER AS SOLDIERS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THE LAWRENCE RAID
SOME DAYS ARE BRIGHT AND SUNNY AND SOME ARE SLOSHED WITH RAIN
THINK OF A MAN BORN OF SPLENDID PARENTS GOOD SURROUNDINGS THE BEST OF ADVANTAGES A FAIR INTELLECTUALITY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WITH COURAGE OF A FIELD GENERAL
HE NEVER KNEW FEAR AND THE FORTY THAT THEN MADE UP THE COMPANY WERE AS BRAVE MEN AS EVER DREW BREATH
MY BROTHER AND I BOTH SUPPOSED TO BE MORTALLY WOUNDED WERE IN THE SAME BED
TAYLOR HAD BEEN THERE
IN THE MEANTIME JOHN HAD GOTTEN THE PISTOL WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE WAGON
HER DEVOTION AND FRIENDSHIP WERE AS ETERNAL AS THE VERY STARS OF HEAVEN AND NO MISFORTUNE COULD DWARF HER GENEROUS IMPULSES OR CURDLE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS IN HER GOOD HEART
COLE YOUNGER ILLUSTRATION
I HOLD TOO THAT IF THERE IS HONOR AMONG THIEVES THERE SHOULD BE AMONG POLITICIANS AND PRETENTIOUS CITIZENS
THE BANK AT HUNTINGTON WEST VIRGINIA WAS ROBBED THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER THAT YEAR AND IN THE CHASE OF THE ROBBERS THOMPSON MCDANIELS WHO HAD FOUGHT WITH US IN THE WAR WAS SHOT AND FATALLY HURT
THE DAY WE WERE PAROLED JIM SAID TO A VISITING NEWSPAPER WOMAN
LET ME SAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT THE FARTHEST THOUGHT FROM MY MIND IS THAT OF POSING AS A CHARACTER
WITH FIRE FLASHING IN HIS EYES AS HE RECALLED THE RECENT WRECK FROM WHICH HIS SISTER HAD BEEN TAKEN IN KANSAS CITY HE ADDED
WE MUST RETREAT THROUGH SOLDIERS
NOW IF ANY RESPECTABLE MAN IN THAT COUNTY WILL SAY HE EVER SAW A
I HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN A MAN CLAIMS TO BE ALL GOODNESS THAT CLAIM ALONE DOES NOT MAKE HIS CREDIT ANY BETTER IN BUSINESS OR AT THE BANK
FOR MYSELF THE ONLY CHARGE AGAINST ME WAS THE UNWARRANTED ONE OF THE KILLING OF YOUNG JUDY DURING THE WAR BUT THE FAILURE OF THE BILL LEFT US STILL UNDER THE BAN OF OUTLAWRY
HE TURNED AROUND AND MADE ALMOST A COMPLETE CIRCUIT BEFORE HE CAME DOWN AND AGAIN ALLOWED HER TO ENJOY THE SECURITY OF HAVING BOTH FEET UPON THE EARTH
THE STATE WAS NEW AND THE LAW HAD BEEN MADE TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO MURDERERS NOT TO PUT THE COUNTY TO THE EXPENSE OF A TRIAL
WE MADE FOR THE WEST FIRING AS WE WENT AND THE SOLDIERS FELL RIGHT AND LEFT
7
SHELBY ON THE RED RIVER THEY WERE SENT INTO LOUISIANA AND I AGAIN BECAME CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY SO REPORTING TO GEN
WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED FROM WASHINGTON AND LEARNED OF THESE OUTRAGES HE WENT TO KANSAS CITY MO HEADQUARTERS OF THE STATE MILITIA TO SEE IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
I WAS A HUNTED MAN
BUT BETWEEN THE TIME WE BROKE CAMP AND THE TIME THEY REACHED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WHO WENT AHEAD DRANK A QUART OF WHISKY AND THERE WAS THE INITIAL BLUNDER AT NORTHFIELD
NEWMAN DAN BEEBE A
HUNTED I HUNT MY HUNTERS
THE STEWARDS TOO BENNER AND DURING THE REEVE REGIME SMITHTON WHICH WHOM AS HEAD NURSE I WAS THROWN IN DIRECT CONTACT NEVER HAD ANY DIFFICULTY WITH ME ALTHOUGH BENNER WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE WOULD SAY TO ME
THE RAILROADS HAD NOT REACHED JACKSON COUNTY AND WILD GAME WAS PLENTIFUL ON MY FATHER'S FARM ON BIG CREEK NEAR LEE'S SUMMIT
NO WONDER YOU'RE SUCH A LITTLE TOT WITH SUCH A GREAT NAME I WON'T ALWAYS BE LITTLE SHE REPLIED
THIS DOES NOT APPLY ALONE TO THE HIGHWAY OUTLAW BUT TO THOSE OUTLAWS WHO ARE SOMETIMES CALLED BY THE SOFTER NAME FINANCIER NOT LONG AGO I HEARD A MAN SPEAK OF A CERTAIN BANKER AND I WAS REMINDED THAT PRISONS DO NOT CONTAIN ALL THE BAD MEN
WHAT MY LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE DIMLY LIGHTED CORRIDORS OF THE PAST DOWN THE LONG VISTA OF TIME A TIME WHEN I FEARED NOT THE FACE OF MORTAL MAN NOR BATTALIONS OF MEN WHEN BACKED BY MY OLD COMRADES IN ARMS IT MAY SEEM INCONSISTENT TO SAY THAT I APPEAR BEFORE YOU WITH A TIMIDITY BORN OF COWARDICE BUT PERHAPS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS IN A PRISON CELL FETTERS A MAN'S INTELLECT AS WELL AS HIS BODY
WHICHER DECLARED THAT HE HAD MURDERED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IN THE EAST AND HE WAS SEEKING A REFUGE FROM THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT PATRIOTIC ENOUGH
HE REACHED IT SAFELY SEIZED A PISTOL AND MADE FOR THE WOODS FOLLOWED BY A HAIL OF BULLETS
MAN TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF ANOTHER IS A QUEER COMBINATION OF CHEEK AND PERVERSITY INSOLENCE PRIDE IMPUDENCE VANITY JEALOUSY HATE SCORN BASENESS INSANITY HONOR TRUTH WISDOM VIRTUE AND URBANITY
WE DETERMINED TO GET IN WITH THESE PEOPLE AND BLUFF IT THROUGH
I LOST NO TIME IN SADDLING UP AND FOLLOWED BY MY LITTLE DETACHMENT RODE HASTILY AWAY TO QUANTRELL'S CAMP FOR RED TAPE OCCUPIED LITTLE SPACE IN THOSE DAYS AND QUICK ACTION WAS NECESSARY IF ANYTHING WAS TO BE DONE
CHAS
JARRETTE CAME NORTH AGAIN I AGAIN BECAME LIEUTENANT BUT WHEN CAPTS
WHEN THEY ABANDONED THE GUARD HOWEVER HE ADMONISHED A NORWEGIAN BOY NAMED OSCAR SUBORN TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH THERE FOR US AND THURSDAY MORNING SEPT
SO STEALTHY HAD BEEN THEIR APPROACH THAT THEY HAD CUT THE SENTRY OFF FROM US BEFORE ALARMING HIM AND HE FLED INTO THE TIMBER IN A SHOWER OF LEAD
WHILE WE WERE PLANNING THE RAID IT WAS INTENDED THAT I SHOULD BE ONE OF THE PARTY TO GO INTO THE BANK
THE INFIDEL WHO RIDICULES RELIGION IS FORCED TO RESPECT THE LAW WHICH IN REALITY IS RELIGION ITSELF
HARRIS WHO WAS REVENUE COLLECTOR FOR MANY YEARS
THESE NEW NEIGHBORS RAN OFF WITH THE HORSES AND NEGROES OF MISSOURI PEOPLE WITHOUT COMPUNCTIONS OF CONSCIENCE AND SOME MISSOURIANS GREW TO HAVE SIMILARLY LAX NOTIONS ABOUT THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF KANSANS
ONE NIGHT HE TOLD THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT THE STORY OF A RAID ON AN EMIGRANT CAMP ON THE COTTONWOOD RIVER
WE PASSED DUNDAS ON THE RUN BEFORE THE NEWS OF THE ROBBERY HAD REACHED THERE AND AT MILLERSBURG TOO WE WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE NEWS BUT AT SHIELDSVILLE WE WERE BEHIND IT
YET IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES IT TAKES EXPERIENCE TO SATISFY HIM
WHEN THE DOOR SWINGS IN ON YOU THERE THE WORLD DOES NOT HEAR YOUR MUFFLED WAIL
WHEN THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY IS THREATENED AND THE FLAG INSULTED WE ARE URGED ON BY NATIONAL PRIDE TO REPEL THE ENEMY BUT IN TIME OF PEACE SELFISH INTERESTS TAKE THE GREATER HOLD OF US AND RETARD US IN OUR DUTY TO COUNTRY
THERE THE TWO GREAT CONTESTANTS ARE COUNTRY AND SELF AND UNLESS THE SPIRIT OF PATRIOTISM GUIDES THE VOTE OUR COUNTRY IS SURE TO LOSE
SOON AFTER THE CONFEDERATES RETURNED
THOSE MISSOURIANS WHO WERE FOR SLAVERY WANTED KANSAS ADMITTED AS A SLAVE STATE AND SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH IT BY THE MOST STRENUOUS EFFORTS
HART'S MASK REVEALED NOTHING
AN IDLE MAN IS SURE TO GO INTO THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER
THERE WAS NO HALF WAY PLACE WITH JIM
IT WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST SCENES IN ALL THE ANNALS OF HUMAN TRAGEDY
PENICK'S MEN WHO HAD IN MANY CASES COLLECTED MORE HORSES THAN THEY REALLY HAD USE FOR HAD LEFT THEM WITH FRIENDS AT VARIOUS POINTS
THE ROMANCERS HAVE CONNECTED JIM AND ME WITH THAT WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS IN LOUISIANA JIM AND BOB WERE AT DALLAS AND JOHN WAS IN CALIFORNIA
WHO KNOWS THE PAST AND WHO CAN JUDGE THEM RIGHT
HERE A SQUAD OF MEN WHO WE AFTERWARDS LEARNED WERE FROM FARIBAULT HAD LEFT THEIR GUNS OUTSIDE A HOUSE
A LOT OF THE BLACKS THERE HAD BEEN MEMBERS OF A NEGRO REGIMENT AND ALL HAD ARMS
THERE WAS A CHEER FOR THAT MAN WHEN HE LEFT THE CAMP AND ANYONE WHO HAD PROPOSED SHOOTING HIM WOULD HIMSELF HAVE BEEN RIDDLED
BELLE TOLD HER PEOPLE SHE WAS TIRED ROAMING THE COUNTRY OVER AND WANTED TO SETTLE DOWN AT SYENE
CAPTAIN YOUNGER WHETHER I DIE OR NOT I WANT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU AS A FRIEND
THE BOY WAS UNCONSCIOUS
BENJAMIN F
IT ROASTED GOV
INSTEAD HE HURRIED INTO INDEPENDENCE AND THAT EVENING THE MILITIA CAME OUT EIGHTY STRONG TO TAKE US PRISONERS
AN EXPEDITION TO GET RID OF THESE WAS PLANNED BY GEN
AS BRUTAL AS HAD BEEN THE TREATMENT OF EVERY ONE NEAR AND DEAR TO HIM HE REFUSED ALWAYS TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON THOSE WHO WERE INNOCENT OF THE WRONGS AND WHO HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE DEEDS WHICH DROVE HIM A BOY INTO THE RANKS OF THE GUERRILLAS BUT HE FOUGHT AS A SOLDIER WHO RIGHTS FOR A CAUSE A CREED AN IDEA OR FOR GLORY
MILITIAMEN FOLLOWED HER SHOT AT JIM THE OLDEST OF THE BOYS AT HOME FOURTEEN AND DROVE HIM INTO THE BRUSH
I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY WERE KILLED THAT NIGHT
JARRETTE WHO HAD REJOINED SHELBY'S COMMAND I BECAME AT 19 CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY
NOW HE COMMANDS THAT MORTAL MAN SHALL DO THE REST AND WHAT A GENEROUS COMMAND IT IS
BUT THE HORSE WAS BETTER THAN APPLE-WOMEN USUALLY RIDE AND THAT AROUSED SOME SUSPICION AT COL
THOMPSON
SHORTLY AFTER THEY CROSSED TO THE INDEPENDENCE SIDE OF THE RIVER THE SOUND OF A WAGON ON THE FROZEN GROUND IMPELLED THEM TO FINISH THE JOB WHERE THEY WERE AS IT WAS ALMOST DAYBREAK AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE SEEN WITH THEIR CAPTIVE
HONEST LABOR IS THE KEY THAT UNLOCKS THE DOOR OF HAPPINESS
FRIENDS WHO LED US TO BELIEVE THAT STONE WALLS DO NOT A PRISON MAKE NOR IRON BARS A CAGE FRIENDS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT HUMAN NATURE AND SINCERITY ARE OFTEN CLOTHED IN PRISON GARB
HE SAID
THE YOUNGERS WERE PASSING AND COLE ASKED IF THEY COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
A FULL STATEMENT AS TO MY WHEREABOUTS DURING THE DAY IS GIVEN IN A LETTER APPENDED HERETO WHICH ALSO SHOWS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE PRESENT AT THE WRECKING OF THE ROCK ISLAND TRAIN IN ADAIR COUNTY IOWA JULY 21 1873
QUANTRELL ON WAR 13
IT WAS A WINTER OF BATTLES TOO NUMEROUS TO BE TOLD HERE AND IT WAS A WINTER TOO THAT LAID A PRICE UPON MY HEAD
ONE OF THE LIES THAT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED BROADCAST CONCERNING ME IS THAT I KILLED FIVE MEN AND SHOT FIVE OTHERS IN A ROW OVER A JOBBED HORSE RACE IN LOUISIANA
BETRAYED THE DAY AFTER THEY BURNED MY MOTHER OUT OF HER HOME THEY MADE ANOTHER TRIAL FOR THE $1,000 REWARD AND THIS TIME THEY HAD A BETTER PROSPECT OF SUCCESS FOR THEY HAD WITH THEM THE TRAITOR MCDOWELL WHOM I HAD CARRIED OUT ON MY HORSE IN THE FIGHT AT NEW SANTA FE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE
WITH A FLOURISH OF HIS REVOLVER ONE OF THE ROBBERS POINTED TO JOSEPH L
AS I WALKED I CAME UPON MRS HURLEY CRYING
BUTLER'S TREATMENT OF THE SOUTHERNERS DURING THE WAR WAS NOT SUCH AS TO COMMEND HIM TO OUR REGARD AND WE FELT LITTLE COMPUNCTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT RAIDING HIM OR HIS
A HUNDRED OF MY FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES WILL BEAR ME OUT IN THE STATEMENT THAT FAR FROM BEING CRUEL TO EITHER DUMB ANIMALS OR HUMAN BEINGS I WAS ALWAYS REGARDED AS KIND AND CONSIDERATE TO BOTH
A DOZEN RAILROADS ENDED IN ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE CENTERS OF BUSINESS THAT WE HAD KNOWN AS LITTLE BETTER THAN FRONTIER TOWNS

IN THE ENEMY'S LINES COL
JIM AND BOB SANG IN THE CHURCH CHOIR THERE UNTIL 1872 WHEN BOB WHO WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN AND IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THE LOCAL BELLES FELT KEENLY THE OBLOQUY ATTACHING TO THE ACCUSATION THAT HIS BROTHER COLE HAD ROBBED THE KANSAS CITY FAIR AND LEFT DALLAS
A NUMBER OF MEN HAVE VISITED ME IN THE PRISON AND ASSURED ME OF THEIR INTEREST IN A PARDON ETC
AND TOO I SAY GOD COULD NOT BE EVERYWHERE SO HE MADE WOMAN
WRAP MY BODY IN THE AMERICAN FLAG SO THE OUTLAW FROM HIS INNER SOUL IF NOT FROM HIS LIPS CRIES OUT OH GOD TURN BACK THE UNIVERSE THERE IS ANOTHER SUBJECT I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT--ONE WHICH I NEVER PUBLICLY ADVOCATED WHILE IN PRISON FOR THE REASON THAT I FEARED THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE IT A DISGUISE TO OBTAIN MY FREEDOM
TODD PASSED AS A MAJOR IN THE SIXTH MISSOURI CAVALRY QUANTRELL A MAJOR IN THE NINTH AND I A CAPTAIN IN AN ILLINOIS REGIMENT
THE SOLDIERS TOOK BACK TO INDEPENDENCE A PAIR OF GLOVES MARKED PRESENTED TO LIEUT
WE MET AT DAVID GEORGE'S AND WENT FROM THERE TOWARD INDEPENDENCE AS FAR AS LITTLE BLUE CHURCH WHERE ALLEN PARMER WHO AFTERWARD MARRIED SUSIE JAMES THE SISTER OF FRANK AND JESSE TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT INSTEAD OF THERE BEING 300 JAYHAWKERS IN INDEPENDENCE THERE WERE 600
REPUTATION IS WHAT SOME ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE YOU
HE WAS ONE OF THE LAST WHEN THE MEN FELL BACK
BEN BUTLER'S MONEY 27
SMALL WONDER THAT HE FOLLOWED HIS BROTHER AS A SOLDIER WHEN HE BECAME OLD ENOUGH IN 1864
I HOPE YOU MAY KILL A GUERRILLA WITH EVERY BULLET I HAVE SOLD YOU SAID ONE MERCHANT TO ME
I HUNTED WILD GEESE WHEN I COULD NOT HAVE DRAGGED A PAIR OF THEM HOME UNAIDED
I CAN DIE AS WELL AS YOU CAN MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAID
AT LAST THE BOYS WHO HAD BEEN IN THE BANK CAME OUT
A MOB AMONG WHOM SHE RECOGNIZED SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE PRETTY DEFINITELY KNOWN TO HAVE MURDERED MY FATHER BROKE IN ON HER AFTER SHE HAD RETURNED TO JACKSON COUNTY SEARCHED THE HOUSE FOR JIM AND ME HUNG JOHN AGED FOURTEEN TO A BEAM AND TOLD HIM TO SAY HIS PRAYERS FOR HE HAD BUT A LITTLE TIME TO LIVE UNLESS HE TOLD WHERE HIS OLDER BROTHERS WERE
I TELL YOU MY FRIENDS THAT I KNOW VERY LITTLE OF WOMEN BUT OF ONE THING I AM MORALLY CERTAIN
THE SERGEANT AND EIGHT MEN OF THE GUARD WERE PERHAPS THIRTY PACES BACK
ELWIN EXPECTING TO GO TO ST PAUL TO WORK FOR YERXA BROS
YES COLE
SECTION 4 OF ARTICLE 11 GAVE AMNESTY TO UNION SOLDIERS FOR THEIR ACTS AFTER JAN
THIS WAS THE INEVITABLE END OF A GUERRILLA WHEN TAKEN PRISONER
WE MUST LEARN OUR LESSONS IN LIFE BY SOME ONE OR ALL OF THESE METHODS
THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN DRAWN HERE BY MERE CURIOSITY TO SEE A CHARACTER OR A MAN WHO BY THE EVENTS OF HIS LIFE HAS GAINED SOMEWHAT OF NOTORIETY WILL MISS THE REAL OBJECT OF THIS LECTURE AND THE OCCASION WHICH BRINGS US TOGETHER
ELWIN INSTEAD OF PUTTING IN HIS AFTERNOONS WHICH WERE FREE AMONG MEN OR ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE AND AIR WHICH HAD SO LONG BEEN OUT OF OUR REACH HE WOULD GO TO HIS ROOM AND REVEL IN SOCIALISTIC LITERATURE WHICH ONLY TENDED TO OVERLOAD A MIND ALREADY SURCHARGED WITH TROUBLES
IT WAS NOTED THAT THE GROCERYMAN HAD MOVED HIS STOCK OF GROCERIES FROM THE BUILDING IN TIME TO SAVE IT FROM RUIN SHOWING THAT THE WRECKING OF THE HOUSE WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD WITH THE MURDER OF MY SISTERS AND COUSINS AND THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE WOMEN IN MIND
FREE AGAIN 37
I VOTE TO FIGHT IT AND WITH FIRE BURN IT BEFORE WE LEAVE SHEPHERD DICK MADDOX SO ON QUANTRELL CALLED THE ROLL
MY SAINTED MOTHER WAS A DIRECT DESCENDANT FROM THE SULLIVANS LADENS AND PERCIVALS OF SOUTH CAROLINA THE TAYLORS OF VIRGINIA AND THE FRISTOES OF TENNESSEE
THAT WAS EARLY IN 1870
15 1874 I WROTE A LETTER TO MY BROTHER-IN-LAW LYCARGUS A
THEY HAD $180,000 ON THEM WHICH WITH THE COTTON AND WAGONS WAS SENT BACK TO BASTROP IN CHARGE OF LIEUT
FOUR INDICTMENTS WERE FOUND AGAINST US
FURTHERMORE RIGHT HERE I WANT TO STATE AND I WILL TAKE MY OATH SOLEMNLY THAT WHAT I SAY IS THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST ME I NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE HAD ANYTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH ROBBING ANY BANK IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI
A CLASH WITH APACHES 17
MANY YEARS AFTERWARD WITH A PARTY OF VISITORS TO THE PRISON CAME A GIRL PERHAPS SIXTEEN WHO REGISTERED IN FULL HORACE GREELEY PERRY I KNEW THERE COULD NOT BE TWO WOMEN WITH SUCH A NAME IN THE WORLD AND I REMINDED HER OF HER PROMISE A PROMISE WHICH SHE DID NOT REMEMBER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD BEEN TOLD HOW SHE HAD MADE FRIENDS WITH THE BOLD BAD MAN WHO AFTERWARDS ROBBED THE BANK AT NORTHFIELD
IN THOSE TWO COMMANDMENTS I HAVE NOT FAILED BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS I FELL SHORT OF MY HOME INFLUENCE AND SO MY YOUNG FRIENDS DO NOT DO AS I HAVE DONE BUT DO AS I TELL YOU TO DO--HONOR THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
NOTHING LIES DEEPER IN MY HEART THAN THE GRATITUDE I FEEL TO THEM ALL EXCEPT A DESIRE TO PROVE MYSELF WORTHY
I HAVE LEARNED THAT A SURPLUS OF DETERMINATION CONQUERS EVERY WEAKNESS
ONE OF THE SILLIEST NOTIONS THAT A YOUNG MAN CAN GET INTO HIS HEAD IS THE IDEA THAT THE WORLD OWES HIM A LIVING
WHEN WITHIN THREE MILES OF KANSAS CITY THE HACK WAS HALTED BY A PICKET ON OUTPOST DUTY AND WHILE THE DRIVER ARGUED WITH THE GUARD QUANTRELL AND I SLIPPED OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HACK AND MADE OUR WAY TO WILLIAM BLEDSOE'S FARM WHERE WE WERE IN FRIENDLY HANDS
SEVENTEEN OF THEM LAY DEAD IN THE CUT THAT NIGHT AND THE REST OF THEM HAD A LIVELY CHASE INTO INDEPENDENCE
THE BILL WAS DRAWN BY GEORGE M

NANNIE HARRIS AND CHARITY KERR NANNIE HARRIS AND CHARITY KERR WALLEY AFTERWARDS CAUSED THE ARREST OF MY COUSINS FEARING THAT THEY HAD RECOGNIZED HIM AND HIS MEN
ONE OF THE LESSONS IMPRESSED UPON ME BY MY LIFE EXPERIENCE IS THE POWER OF THAT WHICH WE CALL PERSONAL INFLUENCE THE POWER OF ONE MIND OR CHARACTER OVER ANOTHER
SOME OF THE FELLOWS FROM OVER ON THE RIVER WANTED THE COWS AND HOGS PUT UP SEPARATELY SO THEY COULD PICK OUT WHAT THEY WANTED AND ASBURY DECLARED HE WAS AFRAID TO CHANGE THE PLAN FOR THE SALE

DURING MY TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT I HAVE SPENT A LARGE PORTION OF THE TIME IN THE HOSPITAL NURSING THE SICK AND SOOTHING THE DYING
SEEING ME FLOUNDERING IN THE DEEP WATER HOWEVER THEY WENT HIGHER UP TO A BRIDGE AND WHEN I LANDED I FOUND MYSELF ALONE
I HAD PREPARED A LECTURE WHICH I DO THINK WOULD NOT HAVE HARMED ANY ONE WHILE IT MIGHT HAVE IMPRESSED A VALUABLE LESSON ON THOSE WHO TOOK IT TO HEART
BOB RAN DOWN THE STREET TOWARD MANNING WHO HURRIED INTO LEE HITCHCOCK'S STORE HOPING IN THAT WAY TO GET A SHOT AT BOB FROM BEHIND
SOME OF THE BOYS SAY HE HAD $8,000 IN THE SADDLE BAGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS OF MISSOURI BUT WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE
IT WAS THE DEPOPULATION OF WESTERN MISSOURI
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERY MAN WHO HAD A MOTHER SHOULD HAVE A PROPER REGARD FOR WOMANHOOD
THIS FACT HAS MADE CARELESS WRITERS CONNECT BROTHER BOB WITH SOME OF MY EXPLOITS AND IN HIS CASE IT SERVED TO THROW SUSPICION ON ME WHEN IN FACT IT WAS PROBABLY BUD OR BILL MCDANIELS THOMPSON'S BROTHER ABOUT WHOM HE WAS RAVING
SATURDAY MORNING WE LEFT OUR HORSES AND STARTED THROUGH ON FOOT HIDING THAT DAY ON AN ISLAND IN A SWAMP
THERE IS THE OUTLAW WHO NEVER DETHRONED A WOMAN'S HONOR OR ASSAILED HER HERITAGE
ON MY SOUL I DO NOT EVEN NOW COMPREHEND SO MONSTROUS A PROPOSITION AND BELIEVE ME EVEN THE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES ABOUT ME IN PRISON LOOKED MORE LIKE MEN THAN YOUR RESPECTABLE CITIZENS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN WITH A PRICE FOR THEIR FRIENDSHIP
WHEN H

I HOPE THAT THE SPEAKER REFERS ONLY TO HIS OWN FEMALE RELATIONS I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND EITHER WHEN A MAN GOES WRONG IT IS CALLED MISFORTUNE WHILE IF A WOMAN GOES WRONG IT IS CALLED SHAME BUT I PRESUME BEING IN PRISON TWENTY-FIVE YEARS I AM NATURALLY DULL AND SHOULD NOT QUESTION A WORLD I HAVE NOT LIVED IN FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
THREE DAYS REMAINED BEFORE THE BATTLE
HE EXPLAINED THAT ELKINS HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED ON HIS ORDERS BUT BY SOME OF PARKER'S MEN WHO WERE IN VICIOUS HUMOR BECAUSE OF THEIR LEADER'S RECENT DEATH
IT IS 250 MILES OR MORE AND NO CROSS LINES OF RAILROAD EXISTED TO FACILITATE OUR PASSAGE SO IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO HAVE MADE THE TRIP
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE MAN NICHOLAS GUSTAVSON WHO WAS SHOT IN THE STREET AND WHO IT WAS SAID DID NOT GO INSIDE BECAUSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH WAS HIT BY A GLANCING SHOT FROM MANNING'S OR WHEELER'S RIFLE
HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MR SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MR AND MRS FICKLE AFTER SERVICE
THE BOY WHO IS TOLD BY HIS MOTHER THAT FIRE BURNS AND WHO HAS SEEN HIS BROTHER BADLY BURNED SURELY DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE THE FACT STILL MORE CLEARLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MIND BY EXPERIENCE
I CLIMBED IN BEHIND AND AS WAS MY CUSTOM TOOK MY PISTOL TO BED WITH ME
QUANTRELL WAS NOT IN THE FIGHT AT LONE JACK AT ALL BUT JARRETTE AND GREGG DID COME UP WITH SOME OF QUANTRELL'S MEN JUST AT THE END AND WERE IN THE CHASE BACK TOWARD LEXINGTON
I WAS THERE AS A PRIVATE IN THE STATE GUARD FIGHTING UNDER PRICE
THE TERM OUTLAW HAS A VARIED MEANING
THEN LAWRENCE IT IS
I DON'T WANT ANY MAN TO RISK HIS LIFE FOR US I SAID TO HIM BUT IF THEY DO COME FOR US GIVE US OUR PISTOLS SO WE CAN MAKE A FIGHT FOR IT IF THEY DO COME AND I WEAKEN HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PISTOLS BUT THE ONLY MOB THAT CAME WAS THE MOB OF SIGHTSEERS REPORTERS AND DETECTIVES
WHEN CAPT
KILLED THE OLDER BOY LEFT THE YOUNGER ONE FOR DEAD AND CARRIED OFF THEIR VALUABLES
SHELBY WHO IN TURN ORDERED ME TO REPORT FOR SPECIAL SERVICE TO GEN
THEY LOOKED UPON A SLAVE OWNER AS LEGITIMATE PREY AND LATER WHEN LINES BECAME MORE CLOSELY DRAWN A SECESSIONIST WAS FIT GAME WHETHER HE HAD OWNED SLAVES OR NOT
AT ANY RATE THE DEATH OF THE INNOCENT LITTLE SAMUELS BOY MADE STILL MORE PRONOUNCED THIS FEELING AGAINST THE OPERATIONS OF THE DETECTIVES AND IN FAVOR OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY WHO HAD BEEN OUTLAWED BY FREMONT HALLECK EWING AND THE DRAKE CONSTITUTION UNGENEROUSLY TO SAY THE LEAST
A MAN HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK IN PRISON AND I MIGHT ADD THAT IT IS AN IDEAL PLACE FOR A MAN TO STUDY LAW RELIGION AND SHAKESPEARE NOT FORGETTING THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGES
HAVE YOU ALL VOTED SHOUTED QUANTRELL

WE MADE A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE INTERIOR OF LITTLE ROCK AND SATISFIED OURSELVES THAT NO MOVEMENT ON PRICE WAS IMMINENT AND WERE ON OUR WAY OUT BEFORE WE BECAME INVOLVED IN A LITTLE SHOOTING MATCH WITH THE PATROL FROM WHICH NO HARM RESULTED TO OUR SIDE HOWEVER EXCEPT A SHOT IN MY LEG

JUNE 2 OF THAT YEAR BEFORE JOHN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS INJURIES MOTHER DIED
WE HAD LOST FIVE HOY BEING KNOCKED DOWN WITH A MUSKET AND TAKEN PRISONER WHILE THEY HAD EIGHTEEN KILLED AND TWENTY-NINE WOUNDED
TALLEY'S PISTOL HAD FILLED WITH SNOW AND HE COULD NOT FIRE A SHOT
IN THE SUMMER OF 1866 THE GOVERNOR OF KANSAS MADE A REQUISITION ON THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI FOR 300 MEN NAMING THEM WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THE ATTACKS ON LAWRENCE AND OTHER KANSAS TOWNS
BUNKER TRIED TO GET A PISTOL THAT LAY NEAR HIM BUT PITTS SAW HIS MOVEMENT AND BEAT HIM TO IT
WIGGINTON BILL HULSE AND JOHN MCCORKLE DID WELL THAT DAY
BILL CHADWELL A YOUNG FELLOW FROM ILLINOIS AND THREE MEN WHOSE NAMES ON THE EXPEDITION WERE PITTS WOODS AND HOWARD
AT THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE 1901 THERE WAS FINALLY PASSED THE BILL WHICH PERMITTED OUR CONDITIONAL PAROLE THE PARDON BOARD NOT BEING READY TO GRANT US OUR FULL FREEDOM
SEVERAL CONFEDERATES FOLLOWED THE YOUNG CONFEDERATE INTO THE ROOM AND I HEARD THEM CALL HIM COLE YOUNGER
EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THERE IS NO TRUE LIBERTY APART FROM LAW
BROWN WENT TOO AND WAS LAUGHED AT FOR HIS EARNESTNESS

THE PRISON HOSPITAL BUILDING IS NOT SUITABLE FOR SUCH USE AND A NEW HOSPITAL BUILDING IS NEEDED BUT NO FAULT CAN BE FOUND WITH THE WAY INVALID PRISONERS ARE CARED FOR AT STILLWATER
BUT WE WERE SURE SHOTS AND ONE VOLLEY BROKE THEIR RANKS IN UTTER CONFUSION
I FORGET THE DATE OF THE ALTON ROBBERY BUT THAT BRANCH OF THE ALTON WAS NOT BUILT UNTIL AFTER WE WERE SENT TO STILLWATER SO WE CAN NOT BE REASONABLY ACCUSED OF THAT
YET TO ALL ETERNITY DAMN THE FIENDISH BUTCHER MCNEIL POOR TOM HE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO A YOUNG LADY IN MONROE COUNTY WHEN HE LEARNED HE WAS TO BE SHOT HE SENT FOR HIS WEDDING SUIT WHICH HAD JUST BEEN MADE DECLARING THAT IF HE COULDN'T BE MARRIED IN IT
THIS WAS THE MCDOWELL WHO LESS THAN THREE MONTHS LATER BETRAYED ONE OF OUR CAMPS TO THE MILITIA IN INDEPENDENCE AND BROUGHT DOWN UPON US A MIDWINTER RAID
GENEVIEVE ROBBERY
HE WAS PERSONALLY KNOWN TO ME AND HAD BEEN MY ENEMY FROM BEFORE THE WAR
CLOSE BEHIND HIM WERE JARRETTE SHEPHERD TOLER LITTLE HOY AND MYSELF AND BEHIND US THE REVOLVERS
BEN BUTLER'S MONEY THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE SITUATION IN MISSOURI SO FAR AS THE YOUNGER BROTHERS WERE CONCERNED
DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE FIGHT MY ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO A YOUNG CONFEDERATE RIDING IN FRONT OF THE CONFEDERATE LINE DISTRIBUTING AMMUNITION TO THE MEN FROM WHAT SEEMED TO BE A SPLINT BASKET HE RODE ALONG UNDER A MOST GALLING FIRE FROM OUR SIDE THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CONFEDERATE LINES AND WHEN HE HAD AT LAST DISAPPEARED OUR BOYS RECOGNIZED HIS GALLANTRY IN RINGING CHEERS
EVERY GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA FROM AS EARLY AS 1889 DOWN TO 1899 WAS PETITIONED FOR OUR PARDON BUT NOT ONE OF THEM WAS SATISFIED OF THE ADVISABILITY OF A FULL PARDON AND THE PAROLE SYSTEM PROVIDED BY THE ENLIGHTENED HUMANITARIANISM OF THE STATE FOR OTHER CONVICTS DID NOT APPLY TO LIFERS
31 1874
BUT JESSE AND I WERE NOT ON FRIENDLY TERMS AT ANY TIME AFTER THE SHEPHERD AFFAIR AND NEVER WERE ASSOCIATED IN ANY ENTERPRISES
HOW OFTEN IN THE DARK DAYS OF THE JOURNEY OVER THE SEA OF LIFE HAVE I CALLED UP THE HAPPY SURROUNDINGS OF MY EARLY DAYS WHEN I HAD A NOBLE FATHER AND DEAR MOTHER TO APPEAL TO IN FAITH FOR COUNSEL

THERE IS THIS MUCH TRUTH ABOUT IT--THERE WAS A JOBBED RACE AND AFTER IT I FOUGHT A DUEL BUT NOT OVER THE RACE
ONE OF THEM IS DON'T TRY TO GET RICH TOO QUICKLY BY GRASPING EVERY BAIT THROWN OUT TO THE UNWARY
HIS RED SHIRT STOOD OUT IN THE FIRST RANK IN EVERY ADVANCE
I WOULD WIN THE INDEPENDENCE OF MY PEOPLE OR I WOULD FIND THEM GRAVES ILLUSTRATION
IF YOU SHOULD SEE A FELLOW MAN WITH TROUBLE'S FLAG UNFURLED AND LOOKIN LIKE HE DIDN'T HAVE A FRIEND IN ALL THE WORLD GO UP AND SLAP HIM ON THE BACK AND HOLLER HOW'D YOU DO AND GRASP HIS HAND SO WARM HE'LL KNOW HE HAS A FRIEND IN YOU AN ASK HIM WHAT'S A-HURTIN HIM AND LAUGH HIS CARES AWAY AN TELL HIM THAT THE DARKEST HOUR IS JUST BEFORE THE DAY
IF I SHOULD SO MAKE OATH HE AS JUDGE WOULD APPOINT A JURY COMMISSIONER WHO WOULD SUMMON A JURY THAT WOULD GIVE ME A FAIR TRIAL BUT HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT AS SOON AS HE DID SO MOB LAW WOULD BE INVOKED BEFORE I COULD GO TO TRIAL

NOTHING WAS TOO TERRIBLE FOR HIS PUNISHMENT
HER FATHER WAS JOHN SHIRLEY WHO DURING THE WAR HAD A HOTEL AT CARTHAGE MO
BILL FELL FROM THE SADDLE DEAD
HE UNDERSTOOD THE PENALTY BUT WENT TO OFFER HIMSELF AS A RANSOM AND WAS SHOT TO DEATH
THE MAN WHO CHOOSES THE CAREER OF OUTLAWRY IS EITHER A NATURAL FOOL OR AN INNOCENT MADMAN
CHRIST'S PARABLE OF THE WHEAT AND THE TARES EXPLAINS THAT TO MY SATISFACTION
AT BIG BLUE WE MET JAS
HE SAID HE AND HIS MEN HAD JUST SHOT A LIEUTENANT OF A CASS COUNTY COMPANY WHOM THEY FOUND WOUNDED AND THAT HE WOULD SHOOT ME AND MY BROTHER
I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CANNOT MATE A WHITE DOVE TO A BLACKBIRD
WHEN I JOINED HIM AGAIN SEVERAL OF PARKER'S MEN WERE STANDING AROUND IN THE CROWD AND AS I SHOOK HANDS WITH ELKINS AND TOLD HIM OF HIS FREEDOM I ADDED IF ANY DAMNED HOUND MAKES FURTHER FALSE CHARGES AGAINST YOU IT'S ME HE'S GOT TO SETTLE WITH AND THAT AT THE PISTOL POINT I MADE THAT TALK AS A SORT OF BLUFF FOR A BLUFF IS OFTEN AS GOOD AS A FIGHT IF IT'S PROPERLY BACKED UP
I WAS THEN MADE HEAD NURSE IN THE HOSPITAL AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE DAY WE WERE PAROLED WARDEN REEVE WHO WAS THERE FOR TWO YEARS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOV

IN 1870 AND 1871 JIM WAS DEPUTY SHERIFF OF DALLAS COUNTY
ABOLITIONISTS ON THE OTHER HAND DETERMINED THAT KANSAS SHOULD BE FREE AND ONE OF THE PLANS FOR INVITING IMMIGRATION FROM THE EASTERN NORTHERN STATES WHERE SLAVERY WAS IN DISREPUTE WAS THE ORGANIZATION OF AN IMMIGRANT AID SOCIETY IN WHICH MANY OF THE LEADING MEN WERE INTERESTED
IT IS THE SUM TOTAL OF WHAT A MAN IS AND ITS EFFECT UPON ANOTHER

THE STAGE TOO HAS ITS LURID DRAMAS IN WHICH WE ARE PAINTED IN DEVILISH BLACKNESS
WE HAD DINNER AT VARIOUS PLACES AND THEN RETURNED TO THE CAMP
IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS I WISH TO SAY THAT FROM COVER TO COVER THERE IS NOT A STATEMENT WHICH COULD NOT BE VERIFIED
MURPHY CALLING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO GO IN WITH HIM AND ROUT US OUT
JIM HENDRICKS DEPUTY SHERIFF OF LEWIS AND CLARK COUNTY MONTANA IS ANOTHER BUT TO ENUMERATE ALL THE MEN OF THE OLD BAND WHO HAVE HELD MINOR PLACES WOULD BE WEARISOME

VISITING ME IN PRISON SHE TOLD ME THAT BELLE STARR WAS THE DAUGHTER OF JOHN SHIRLEY AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD I ANY CLUE AS TO HER IDENTITY

YOU'RE A----LIAR CONTINUED JOHN I SAW THEM THERE MYSELF AT THIS ANOTHER RUSSELL A BROTHER OF THE ONE WHOSE PIPE HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH OPENED FIRE ON JOHN AND WOUNDED HIM IN THE ARM
QUANTRELL LEFT WITHOUT HIS COMMISSION
JACKSON COUNTY WAS SO NAMED IN HONOR OF HIS OLD GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON WITH WHOM HE SERVED AT THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS
HE WAS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS THIS HORSE OF HER SWEETHEART AND HE ROSE HIGH IN THE AIR WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN STILL CLINGING
AMONG THEM WAS CAPTAIN IRVIN WALLEY WHO EVEN THOUGH A MARRIED MAN WAS PARTICULARLY OBNOXIOUS IN FORCING HIS ATTENTIONS ON THE YOUNG WOMEN
I HAD TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT A BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO LAKES NEAR THERE AND ACCORDINGLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THE ROBBERS HAD PASSED MANKATO VOUGHT THOUGHT OF THIS BRIDGE AND IT WAS GUARDED BY HIM AND OTHERS FOR TWO NIGHTS
IT WAS A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO THE GUERILLAS AT LEAST THAT YOUNG JUDY HAD BEEN KILLED BY DICK MADDOX AND JOE HALL AND THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE TIME OF THE FIGHT I WAS MILES AWAY AT AUSTIN MO
JARRETTE GOING UP THE MAINLAND WHILE KENNEDY AND I WITH THREE MEN TOOK A BOAT TO SAN FRANCISCO DISGUISED AS MEXICAN MINERS
FATHER DENOUNCED IT AS A LIE
THE CONVOY GOT AWAY WITH TEN SURVIVORS BUT EVERY DRIVER WAS SHOT AND FOUR COTTON BUYERS WHO WERE CLOSE BEHIND IN AN AMBULANCE WERE HUNG IN A COTTON GIN NEAR AT HAND
SEVEN MILITIAMEN DIED THAT DAY
THIS MAKES LIVING AND ACTING AMONG OUR FELLOWS A SERIOUS BUSINESS
CROOK AFTERWARD FOUGHT OVER INCH BY INCH WE HAD A REAL INDIAN FIGHT WITH APACHE MOJAVES WHICH LASTED THROUGH TWO DAYS AND THE NIGHT BETWEEN PRACTICALLY WITHOUT CESSATION
WE THEN DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTIES AND STARTED FOR NORTHFIELD BY SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ROUTES
I WAS THE SEVENTH OF FOURTEEN CHILDREN BUT MY FATHER HAD PROSPERED AND WE WERE GIVEN THE BEST EDUCATION THE LIMITED FACILITIES OF THAT PART OF THE WEST THEN AFFORDED
THE COLONEL WAS A SOUTHERNER AND HIS DAUGHTER HAD THE SOUTHERN SPIRIT TOO
THINK OF IT--A PRICE FOR A MAN'S PROFFERED FRIENDSHIP

DOES THE REBEL CROP NEED ANY RAIN OUT IN YOUR COUNTRY THE SERGEANT AT THE RESERVE POST SEIZED HER BRIDLE AND LOOKING UP SAID
A PRICE ON MY HEAD 11
A LITTLE TOT THEN SHE SAID SHE COULD RIDE A HORSE TOO AND REACHING DOWN I LIFTED HER UP BEFORE ME AND WE RODE UP AND DOWN
THIS IS ONE GREAT LESSON TO BE IMPRESSED UPON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AT THIS TIME I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ONE NAMED BELLE STARR AND I WAS AT A LOSS AS TO HER IDENTITY UNTIL THE LATE LILLIAN LEWIS THE ACTRESS WHO WAS RELATED TO SOME VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF OUR FAMILY INQUIRED ABOUT HER ON ONE OF HER TOURS THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST
I'LL NOT PUT IRONS ON EM REPLIED HALL
HOWEVER I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO TRY TO GET INTO PRISON JUST TO FIND AN IDEAL PLACE FOR THESE PARTICULAR STUDIES
YOUR LOCOMOTIVE WITH HER FOLLOWING LOAD OF LIFE AND TREASURE IS SAFE WHILE SHE KEEPS THE RAILS BUT SUPPOSE THAT WITH AN INSANE DESIRE FOR A LARGER LIBERTY SHE LEFT THE RAILS AND STRUCK OUT FOR HERSELF A NEW PATHWAY RUIN CHAOS AND DEATH WOULD STREW HER COURSE
AT BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING I SAID
THE YOUNGER BROTHERS MAINTAINED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY LIVED AND WERE WELL ESTEEMED AS WERE THEIR PARENTS FOR THEIR GOOD CONDUCT AND CHARACTER
HE HAD FELT THE TRUTH OF HIS FIERY SPEECH
JAILER GRIFFIN AND HIS 15-YEAR-OLD SON WERE KILLED THERE
THAT NIGHT I GAVE QUANTRELL FOR COL
WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG-SOUGHT HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
IN SEPTEMBER 1863 SOLDIERS RANSACKED THE HARRIS HOME STOLE EVERYTHING THEY CONSIDERED VALUABLE AND BURNED THE HOUSE
THOMP
MY SOUL'S DESIRE IS TO BENEFIT YOU BY RECOUNTING SOME OF THE IMPORTANT LESSONS WHICH MY LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME
BUT AS THE YEARS WENT BY THE POPULAR FEELING AGAINST US NOT ONLY SUBSIDED BUT OUR ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION TO THE MINUTEST DETAILS OF PRISON DISCIPLINE WON FOR US THE CONSIDERATION I MIGHT EVEN SAY THE HIGH ESTEEM OF THE PRISON OFFICIALS WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH US AND AS THE NORTHFIELD TRAGEDY BECAME MORE AND MORE REMOTE THOSE WHO FAVORED OUR PARDON BECAME MORE NUMEROUS AND YEARLY NUMBERED IN THEIR RANKS MORE AND MORE OF THE INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF THE STATE WHO BELIEVED THAT OUR CRIME HAD BEEN AVENGED AND THAT JIM AND I THE ONLY SURVIVORS OF THE TRAGEDY WOULD BE WORTHY CITIZENS IF RESTORED TO FREEDOM
STEELE AT LITTLE ROCK WAS PREPARING TO MOVE AGAINST PRICE AT CAMDEN AND TO MAKE THE GRAND ROUND OF THE PICKET POSTS FROM WARREN TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER UP THE ARKANSAS TO PINE BLUFF AND LITTLE ROCK AND RETURNING BY WAY OF THE WESTERN OUTPOST AT HOT SPRINGS
IT IS TOO OFTEN SUGARCOATED WITH THE WORD PATRIOTISM TO MAKE IT BEARABLE AND MEN CALL IT NATIONAL HONOR COME WITH ME TO THE PRISON WHERE FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY I HAVE OCCUPIED A LONELY CELL
HER FRANTIC SCREAMS WHEN THEY DEMANDED THAT SHE DELIVER ME UP TO THEM CAUSED A MOMENTARY CONFUSION WHICH ENABLED ME TO GAIN HER SIDE AND TOGETHER WE MADE FOR THE GATE WHERE I TOOK FOR THE WOODS AMID A SHOWER OF LEAD NONE OF THE BULLETS EVEN SO MUCH AS SKINNING ME ALTHOUGH FROM THE HOUSE TO THE GATE I WAS IN THE FULL GLARE OF THE LIGHT
PHILLIPS WHO AS A BOY HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE STREETS THE DAY WE ENTERED NORTHFIELD
SOCIETY IS AN AGGREGATE OF UNITS
HAYS AND I ARRIVED HAD HIS MEN DRAWN UP IN LINE OF BATTLE WHILE THE OFFICERS WERE HOLDING A COUNCIL IN HIS QUARTERS
BUT IT MATTERED NOTHING TO ME--HE WAS MY FRIEND
THERE IS NO HEROISM IN OUTLAWRY AND THE FATE OF EACH OUTLAW IN HIS TURN SHOULD BE AN EVERLASTING LESSON TO THE YOUNG OF THE LAND
WE HAD RIDDEN AS FAR AS NASHVILLE AND SOLD OUR HORSES THERE CARRYING THE SADDLE POCKETS WITH US
MAY 23 OF THAT YEAR THE BANK AT RICHMOND MO WAS RAIDED MAYOR SHAW WAS KILLED AND THE ROBBERS RAIDED THE JAIL WHERE WERE CONFINED A NUMBER OF PRISONERS WHOSE ARREST IT WAS CLAIMED WAS DUE TO THEIR SYMPATHY WITH SECESSION
PACKING HIM UP BEHIND ME WE RETURNED TO OUR CAMP IN SAFETY
THAT'S LOGIC
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO MAKE ANY OTHER USE OF IT
OF COURSE I'M NOT AFRAID THE THREE OF US TALKED TILL BEDTIME WHEN HUDSPETH TOLD US TO OCCUPY THE SAME BED
JACKSON AND A FORCE OF ABOUT 300 MYSELF AMONG THE NUMBER WERE SENT ACROSS THE STAKED PLAINS INTO COLORADO TO INTERCEPT SOME WAGON TRAINS AND TO CUT THE TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEGRAPH LINE FROM LEAVENWORTH TO SAN FRANCISCO
HE WAS NEVER STRONG PHYSICALLY AFTER THE SHOT PIERCED HIS LUNG IN THE LAST FIGHT NEAR MADELIA
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR NERVE WHO TOLD YOU THAT COLE HE ANSWERED
IN OCTOBER 1902 HE LEFT MAJ
ORGANIZING A POSSE FROM MEN LIKE THEMSELVES SHERIFFS OR OTHERS PRETENDING TO BE SHERIFFS WOULD TAKE THEIR MOBS ROUT MEN OUT OF THEIR BEDS AT NIGHT UNDER SERVICE OF WRITS ON WHICH THE ONLY RETURN EVER MADE WAS A PISTOL SHOT SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS MAYBE IN THE VICTIM'S DOORYARD PERHAPS IN SOME LONELY COUNTRY ROAD
WE HAD SOMETHING TO LEARN YET SAID BLUNT TO HIS COMPANIONS AND WE HAVE LEARNED IT
I JUMPED TO MY FEET AND SAID THAT THE MEN THAT MADE THE CHARGES LIED AND THAT I STOOD READY TO RAM THE LIE DOWN THEIR THROATS WITH A PISTOL POINT
DYKES WHO WAS CALLED UPON TO PRESERVE ORDER AT THE POLLS HE OF COURSE HAVING NO INTEREST AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL CANDIDATES AND WITH PISTOLS IN EASY REACH HE MAINTAINED PERFECT ORDER DURING ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING ELECTIONS LAKE CITY HAD EVER HAD
THIS PERHAPS AS MUCH AS WALLEY'S ENMITY FOR ME MADE HIM THE TARGET FOR THE FREEBOOTERS WHO INFESTED THE KANSAS LINE
AFTER EXPRESSING THEIR GRATITUDE A LEADING MEMBER OF THE CHURCH SAID TO THE GENEROUS DONOR
I HAD NOT TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO TELL HER TO START IT LOWER AND THERE WERE NOW ONLY TWO WAYS OUT OF IT EITHER TO GIVE HER MORE MONEY OR HAVE IT KNOCKED DOWN TO HER RIGHT THERE
I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE HONOR OF THE REPUBLIC IS PUT UPON THE PLAINS AND BATTLED FOR
ABOUT 9:30 A.M I WAS SHOT DOWN
I TOOK THE MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET AND GAVE IT TO HER AND TOLD HER TO BID IT IN WHEN THE TIME CAME AND I GAVE HER THE SIGNAL
CHIEF OF DETECTIVES MCDONOUGH OF ST LOUIS WHOM I HAD PASSED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE IN THE UNION DEPOT AT ST LOUIS WAS AMONG OUR VISITORS AT FARIBAULT
AT NIGHTFALL THE INDIANA BATTERY OPENED ON LONE JACK AND THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDS WERE CUT IN TWO COFFEE RETREATING TO THE SOUTH WHILE COCKRELL WITHDREW TO THE WEST AND WHEN COL
SHE BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING SO THAT SHE AND HER CHILDREN AND SUSE WOULD NOT BE TURNED OUT IN THE SNOW THEN SOME TWO OR THREE FEET DEEP IN THE DARKNESS WITH THE NEAREST NEIGHBOR MANY MILES AWAY
STILL IT DID NOT DISCOURAGE OUR FRIENDS ON THE OUTSIDE
MCCOY WITH ME OR JOHN I WILL SAY NO MORE
WALLEY
I WOULD BREAK UP FOREIGN ENLISTMENTS BY INDISCRIMINATE MASSACRE
23
NATURALLY WE WERE SOUTHERNERS IN SYMPATHY AND IN FACT
MCCOY DURING THE WAR BUT HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE NOTWITHSTANDING THE APPLETON CITY PAPER SAYS HE HAS BEEN WITH US IN THAT COUNTY FOR TWO YEARS

HE REACHED FOR HIS PISTOL BUT HE NEVER PULLED IT
QUANTRELL TOLD A FRIEND THAT OF THE 32 WHO WERE CONCERNED IN THE KILLING OF HIS BROTHER ONLY TWO REMAINED ALIVE AND THEY HAD MOVED TO CALIFORNIA
I DECIDED THAT THE SHORTEST WAY OUT OF IT WAS TO HAVE ASBURY KNOCK IT DOWN TO HER THEN AND THERE SO I GAVE HIM THE SIGN

JIM INCLUDING THE WOUND IN THE SHOULDER HE RECEIVED AT NORTHFIELD HAD BEEN SHOT FIVE TIMES THE MOST SERIOUS BEING THE SHOT WHICH SHATTERED HIS UPPER JAW AND LAY IMBEDDED BENEATH THE BRAIN AND A SHOT THAT BURIED ITSELF UNDERNEATH HIS SPINE AND WHICH GAVE HIM TROUBLE TO THE DAY OF HIS DEATH

SPEAK OUT
THE REITERATED REQUESTS FOR OUR PARDON COMING FROM MEN THE GOVERNORS HAD CONFIDENCE IN URGING THEM TO A PARDON THEY WERE RELUCTANT TO GRANT LED TO A FEELING WHICH FOUND EXPRESSION FINALLY IN OFFICIAL CIRCLES THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARDONING POWER SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY THE CREATION OF A BOARD OF PARDONS AS EXISTED IN SOME OTHER STATES
VERY SOON AFTERWARD AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE SHE BECAME AS SHE HAD DREAMED IN CHILDHOOD A NEWSPAPER MAN EDITING THE ST PETER JOURNAL AND TO THE HOUR OF MY PARDON SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS FOR US
I WAS ACCOUNTED A FAIRLY GOOD POKER PLAYER IN THOSE DAYS AND HAD WON ABOUT $3,000 THE WINTER I WAS IN FLORIDA WHILE CHADWELL WAS ONE OF THE BEST THAT EVER PLAYED THE GAME

HONEST FRIENDSHIP IS A GRAND RELIGION AND IF WE ARE TRUE TO OURSELVES THE POET TELLS US WE CANNOT BE FALSE TO ANY MAN
I HAVE LEARNED THAT POLITICS IS OFTEN MERE TRAFFIC AND STATESMANSHIP TRICKERY
BEFORE HE DIED IN A SKIRMISH WITH NORTHERN TROOPS IN 1864 HE HAD TIED FIFTY-THREE KNOTS IN A SILKEN CORD WHICH HE CARRIED IN HIS BUCKSKIN POUCH
I RAN UP TO HIM AND PLANTING MY PISTOL BETWEEN HIS EYES COMMANDED HIM TO DROP THE GUN WHICH THE BARBER GOT IN A JIFFY

I HAVE SINCE LEARNED HOWEVER FROM THE MEN WHO DID KILL WHICHER THAT JESSE DID NOT KILL HIM BUT HAD BELIEVED HIS STORY AND HAD BEEN INCLINED TO WELCOME HIM AS A FELLOW WANDERER
THAT DAY BELLE REED TOLD ME HER TROUBLES AND THAT NIGHT AUNT SUSE OUR FAMILY SERVANT WARNED ME
I SAW SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT WERE STANDING AT OR NEAR THE GATE AND THEY ALL SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THE PARTY THAT DID THE ROBBING
BY A KIND OF NECESSITY WHICH I CANNOT AT THIS POINT STOP TO EXPLAIN I HAVE HAD TO LEARN SOME VERY IMPRESSIVE LESSONS OF MY LIFE BY THE STERN TEACHER EXPERIENCE
OH
DISREGARDING THE LAW BY WHICH THEY MOVE THEY WOULD BECOME WANDERERS IN THE BLEAK DARKNESS FOREVER
JARRETTE OVER US BOTH
I DID AND HE SET THEM UP ON THE FARM AND I CUT OUT A LOT OF THE CALVES FROM ONE OF MY TWO HERDS AND LEFT WITH THEM
I TOLD PITTS TO PUT HIM UP WITH ME AND I WOULD PACK HIM OUT BUT WHEN WE LIFTED HIM I SAW HE WAS DEAD AND I TOLD PITTS TO LAY HIM DOWN AGAIN
BOB YOUNGER BOB YOUNGER BUT I WAS DETERMINED TO TAKE NO FURTHER CHANCES AND TOLD BOB TO GET IN A HACK THAT STOOD OUTSIDE AND IF WE WERE STOPPED I WOULD GET ON TOP AND DRIVE

WHAT IS THE TROUBLE SHE EXPLAINED THAT HER HUSBAND HAD MORTGAGED THE PROPERTY AND STOCK BEFORE HIS DEATH AND SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LIFT IT AND THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HER
BUT NOT SO THE WAR ON HER
I HAVE LEARNED THAT WHOEVER SAYS THERE IS NO GOD IS A FOOL
ASBURY HUMPHREYS WHO WAS THE AUCTIONEER KNEW ME FROM THE STORY OF THE DUEL AND BEFORE HE BEGAN I TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE PROPERTY ALL UP AT ONCE
AS WE AFTERWARD LEARNED THIS WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US AS WELL AS TO THEM FOR THEY STOLE TWO HORSES SOON AFTER LEAVING US AND THE POSSE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL OF THESE HORSES NOT KNOWING THAT OUR PARTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED

BUT SUNDAY AFTERNOON OCT
WE HAD A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE IN WEAPONS BUT THE REDS WERE PESTIFEROUS IN SPITE OF THAT AND THEY KEPT US BUSY FOR FULLY 36 HOURS PLUGGING THEM AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY
EVEN THEY DID NOT TRUST MCDOWELL FOR HE CLOSELY GUARDED WAS KEPT IN FRONT
HOWEVER I AM FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THERE ARE MANY BRANDS OF FRIENDSHIP EXISTING THESE DAYS WHICH HAD NOT BIRTH IN OUR TIME
ALL LAW IS FOUNDED UPON SCRIPTURE AND SCRIPTURE IN FORM OF RELIGION OR LAW RULES THE UNIVERSE
AND TOO I AM NOT SO SURE THAT I CARE FOR THAT KIND OF ORATORY THAT LEAVES THE POINTS TO GUESS AT BUT RATHER THE SIMPLE LANGUAGE OF THE SOUL THAT NEEDS NO INTERPRETER

THE LITTLE BOY WAS BEING STRIPPED OF THE ADORNMENTS PECULIAR TO INDIANS WHEN THE OUTLAW RODE UPON THE SCENE
THE HORRORS OF GUERRILLA WARFARE BEFORE THE RAID AT LAWRENCE WERE ECLIPSED AFTER IT
THE YOUNGERS WERE FROM THE CITY OF STRASBURG ON THE RHINE DESCENDING FROM THE RULING FAMILY OF STRASBURG WHEN THAT WAS A FREE CITY
THEREIN ALL HONOR LIES
BUT UNDER THE CARE OF FRIENDLY INDIANS CHARLES QUANTRELL LIVED
THE YOUNG FAWN MOUNTED HIS HORSE BUT BEFORE THE PASSPORT OF PEACE WAS DELIVERED THE BRAVE LITTLE COURIER WAS SHOT TO PIECES BY A CAVALCADE OF ARMED MEN WHO SLEW HIM BEFORE QUESTIONING HIS MISSION
ONE OF THEM WAS ONLY SENT TO THE COUNTY JAIL AND THE OTHER SERVED A YEAR IN STILLWATER PRISON WITHOUT EVER SEEING US
WEISS E
QUANTRELL HAD JOINED GEN
COLE YOUNGER SAVED AT LEAST A DOZEN LIVES THIS DAY
THE WILD WEST THE COLE YOUNGER AND FRANK JAMES HISTORICAL WILD WEST SHOW IS AN EFFORT ON THE PART OF TWO MEN WHOSE EXPLOITS HAVE BEEN MORE WILDLY EXAGGERATED PERHAPS THAN THOSE OF ANY OTHER MEN LIVING TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING AND DEMONSTRATE TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA THAT THEY ARE NOT AS BLACK AS THEY HAVE BEEN PAINTED
OUTLAWRY IS OFTEN A FIT COMPANION FOR TREASON AND ANARCHY FOR WHICH THE LOWEST SEATS OF HELL SHOULD BE RESERVED
JARRETTE AND POOLE REPORTED TO GEN
THE NORTHFIELD RAID WHILE PITTS AND I WERE WAITING FOR BOB AND CHADWELL WE SCOUTED ABOUT GOING TO MADELIA AND AS FAR AS THE EASTERN PART OF COTTON-WOOD COUNTY TO FAMILIARIZE OURSELVES WITH THE COUNTRY
RETREAT TO THE NORTH WAS CUT OFF BY THE OTHER FORTY AND THEY HAD US BETWEEN THEM
HAYS REGIMENT WHICH WAS A PART OF THE BRIGADE OF GEN
SO LEARN TO TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME AND DON'T SWEAT AT THE PORES BECAUSE THE LORD'S OPINION DOESN'T COINCIDE WITH YOURS
21 JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER THE ROBBERY OSCAR SAW US AND FLED INTO TOWN WITH THE ALARM
QUANTRELL AND HIS MEN HAD RAIDED OLATHE AND SHAWNEE-TOWN AND AMONG THE KILLED AT PAOLA ON THE WAY OUT FROM OLATHE WAS A MAN NAMED JUDY WHOSE FATHER HAD FORMERLY LIVED IN CASS COUNTY BUT HAD GONE TO KANSAS AS A REFUGEE
I DO NOT REMEMBER THE DATE BUT MR MURPHY ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS WAS SICK ABOUT THAT TIME AND I SAT UP WITH HIM REGULARLY WHERE I MET WITH SOME OF HIS NEIGHBORS EVERY DAY
HE PROMISED TO LEND ME ALL HIS AID AND INFLUENCE AND I STARTED OUT TO SEE QUANTRELL AFTER FIRST TELLING MY MEN TO KEEP THEIR HORSES SADDLED READY FOR A RESCUE AND RETREAT IN CASE I FAILED OF A PEACEABLE DELIVERANCE
AT ONE HOUSE HE CAPTURED FIVE CITIZENS OVER WHOM HE PUT A GUARD AND AT ANOTHER THREE WHOM HE DEFENDED AND PROTECTED
ALL OF MY RELATIVES HOWEVER WERE SAVED FROM DEATH EXCEPT CHARITY KERR WHO WAS HELPLESS IN BED WITH THE FEVER AND SHE WENT DOWN WITH THE WRECK AND HER BODY FRIGHTFULLY MANGLED WAS AFTERWARDS TAKEN FROM THE RUINS
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL WITH THAT HINT I THEREAFTER EVADED THE WIFE OF MY FORMER COMRADE IN ARMS
THE BOYS SWARMED OUT OF THE DUG-OUTS AND THE FIGHTING WAS HOT
WARRANTS WERE ISSUED FOR A NUMBER OF THE OLD GUERRILLAS INCLUDING ALLEN PARMER AFTERWARD THE HUSBAND OF SUSIE JAMES ALTHOUGH HE WAS WORKING IN KANSAS CITY AT THE TIME AND PROVED AN ABSOLUTE ALIBI
CHASING COTTON THIEVES 16
THOUGH A SLAVE-OWNER FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN IN SYMPATHY WITH SECESSION BELIEVING AS IT TURNED OUT THAT IT MEANT THE DEATH OF SLAVERY
MAJ
THE BILL WAS BEATEN DEMOCRATS AND CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS VOTING AGAINST IT
SADDLE UP WE REACHED LAWRENCE THE MORNING OF THE 21ST
LOST--TWENTY-FIVE YEARS 33
ALL GRAIN AND HAY IN THE PROSCRIBED DISTRICT WAS TO BE TURNED INTO THE MILITARY POST BEFORE SEPT
THE SLUNGSHOT WAS FOUND WITH THE THONG TWINED ABOUT GILLCREAS WRIST
WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THE PETITIONERS IN THIS CASE HAVE BY EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CONDUCT IN PRISON FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AND THE EVIDENCE THEY HAVE GIVEN OF SINCERE REFORMATION EARNED THE RIGHT TO A PAROLE IF ANY LIFE PRISONER CAN DO SO AND JULY 14 1901 JIM AND I WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
ALSO THE GAD'S HILL ROBBERY
I CONFESS THAT I HAVE NO INEXPRESSIBLE YEARNINGS TO TRY MY LIFE OVER AGAIN EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO DO SO
VOUGHT WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SEVEN TO GO IN TO GET US
THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE THROWN INTO AN OLD RICKETY TWO-STORY HOUSE LOCATED BETWEEN 14TH AND 15TH STREETS ON GRAND AVENUE KANSAS CITY MO
WE THEN RENTED THE BASS FARM ON LAKE PROVIDENCE IN CARROLL PARISH WHERE I STAYED UNTIL 1867 WHEN CHILLS AND FEVER DROVE ME NORTH TO MISSOURI
IF THE FRONT SEATS OF PARADISE ARE NOT RESERVED FOR WOMEN I AM WILLING TO TAKE A BACK SEAT WITH THEM
PEABODY AT INDEPENDENCE HAD SENT OUT A SCOUTING PARTY TO FIND ME OR ANY ONE ELSE OF THE COMPANY THEY COULD BEAT UP BLYTHE WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY CAME BUT HIS SON AGED TWELVE WAS
BUT GOODNESS AND BADNESS IS APT TO RUN IN STREAKS
THEN HEARING SIDENER AND THE OTHERS REFUSE SLIPPED UP ONE CORNER OF THE BANDAGE AND SEEING THE REST WITH THEIR EYES UNCOVERED REMOVED THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS OWN DIED AS INNOCENT AS A LAMB THERE WERE HUMSTEAD AND BIXLER AND LAKE AND MCPHEETERS AND THERE WAS THAT MOST WONDROUS MARTYR OF THEM ALL--YOUNG SMITH OF KNOX COUNTY--WHO DIED FOR ANOTHER MAN HUMPHREY WAS THE DOOMED MAN HIS HEART-BROKEN WIFE IN WIDOW'S WEEDS WITH HER EIGHT HELPLESS LITTLE ONES IN DEEP MOURNING THAT WAS ONLY LESS BLACK THAN THE ANGUISH THEY ENDURED OR THE HEART OF HIM TO WHOM THEY APPEALED RUSHED TO THE FEET OF MCNEIL AND IN ACCENTS SO PITEOUS THAT A SOUL OF ADAMANT MUST HAVE MELTED UNDER IT BESOUGHT HIM FOR THE LIFE OF THE HUSBAND AND FATHER SHE WAS BRUTALLY REPULSED BUT STRACHAN THE MONSTER OF SHELBY COUNTY WHOM THE ANGEL A FEW MONTHS AFTERWARD SMOTE WITH HERODIAN ROTTENNESS--STRACHAN WHOSE FLESH LITERALLY FELL FROM HIS LIVING SKELETON--STRACHAN WHO HAS LONG BEEN PAYING IN
IT WAS AT FIRST PROPOSED THAT THE BOARD SHOULD CONSIST OF THE GOVERNOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE WARDEN OF THE PRISON BUT BEFORE THE BILL PASSED SENATOR ALLEN J
YEARS AFTERWARD THIS KILLING OF JUDY TURNED UP TO SHUT ME OUT OF MISSOURI
QUANTRELL AND THREE OTHERS WERE SENT OUT TO MEET AN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD TRAIN OF NEGROES FROM MISSOURI
SHE WAS THEN THE WIFE OF JIM REED WHO HAD BEEN IN MY COMPANY DURING THE WAR AND SHE WAS AT THE HOME OF HIS MOTHER
BUT THE FREEBOOTERS WERE NOT THROUGH
I ASKED HER NAME AND SHE SAID IT WAS HORACE GREELEY PERRY AND I REPLIED
WILLIAM GREGG WILLIAM GREGG LAWRENCE HE RELIED
THE LAST TWENTY-SIX YEARS BY A TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL BROUGHT ME TO THE PRESENT PLACE AND HOUR
IT IS THE HEAD DEVIL OF THE KILLING AND BURNING IN JACKSON COUNTY
WE COULD NOT GO OUT WITHOUT A PAIR OF PISTOLS TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THE ATTACK OF WE KNEW NOT WHOM
THE EXPERIMENT BECAME A HABIT WITH THE JAYHAWKERS AND SUCH VISITS WERE FREQUENT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING FALL WHEN THE WORST OF ALL THE INDIGNITIES HEAPED UPON MY FAMILY WAS TO BE CHARGED AGAINST THEM--THE MURDER OF MY FATHER
IN BATTLE HE NEVER HAD THOSE TO GO WHERE HE WOULD NOT FOLLOW AYE WHERE HE WOULD NOT GLADLY LEAD
WOULD THEY PERMIT MAJOR TATE'S FAMILY TO ESCAPE
GOV
I WAS HARD PRESSED FOR A TIME TILL THEY CAME UP AND RELIEVED ME
CLASHES WERE ALMOST DAILY BUT FEW OF THEM INVOLVED ANY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN
HIS HOME WAS FRIENDLY TO EVERY CONFEDERATE SOLDIER AND SCOUT IN THE WEST
HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER BUT COCKRELL AND FOSTER WERE NEIGHBORS IN JOHNSON COUNTY AND COCKRELL DID NOT HAVE AS GOOD AN IDEA OF FOSTER'S FIGHTING QUALITIES THAT NIGHT AS HE DID TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LATER
MRS HURLEY HAD HER GOODS AND THE CREDITOR HAD HIS MONEY AND I WAS OUT $80 WHILE ASBURY'S RELIABILITY AS AN AUCTIONEER WAS CALLED INTO SOME QUESTION UNTIL HIS POSITION IN THE MATTER WAS FULLY UNDERSTOOD
ALL RELATIONS STAY AWAY FROM ME
AND FINALLY AFTER ONE OF THE YOUNG RUFFIANS WHO HAD HELPED IN THE ROBBERY OF THE MISSOURI PACIFIC EXPRESS CAR AT OTTERVILLE CONFESSED THAT WE WERE WITH THE ROBBERS WE DECIDED TO MAKE ONE HAUL AND WITH OUR SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS START LIFE ANEW IN CUBA SOUTH AMERICA OR AUSTRALIA
WE TOOK A TRIP INTO TOWN THAT FORENOON AND I LOOKED OVER THE BANK
I HAD HOPED IF MY PARDON HAD BEEN MADE UNCONDITIONAL TO EARN A LIVELIHOOD ON THE LECTURE PLATFORM
GET INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH HIM BUT DON'T TRY TO BE THE LEADING MEMBER OF THE FIRM
FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS NOW WE HAVE BEEN SUMMONED HERE TO HAVE MEN STARE AT US AND QUESTION US AND THEN GO BACK AND WRITE UP WHAT THEY THINK AND BELIEVE
THIS IS FALSE
SOME OF THESE WERE MISGUIDED AND DID US MORE HARM THAN GOOD
IT HAS BEEN CHARGED THAT MY FATHER TRIED TO DRAW HIS PISTOL ON A PARTY OF SOLDIERS WHO SUSPECTED ME OF THE MURDER OF ONE OF THEIR COMRADES AND WANTED TO KNOW MY WHEREABOUTS
EMERSON SAID YOU SEND YOUR BOY TO SCHOOL TO BE EDUCATED BUT THE EDUCATION THAT HE GETS IS LARGELY FROM THE OTHER BOYS IT IS A KIND OF EDUCATION THAT HE WILL REMEMBER LONGER AND HAVE A GREATER INFLUENCE UPON HIS CHARACTER AND CAREER IN LIFE THAN THE INSTRUCTIONS HE GETS FROM THE TEACHER
AMNESTY BILL FAILS THE KILLING OF LULL DANIELS AND WHICHER WITHIN A SINGLE WEEK WAS UNDOUBTEDLY EXASPERATING TO THE HEAD OF THE PINKERTON AGENCY AND HAD HE NOT BEEN PERSONALLY EMBITTERED THEREBY HE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE AVENGED IT SO TERRIBLY
THERE IS GOODNESS IN ALL MEN AND SERMONS EVEN IN STONES
PENICK IN COMMAND AT INDEPENDENCE HEARING OF THE KANSAS CITY ADVENTURE PUT A PRICE OF $1,000 ON MY HEAD AND OTHER FIGURES ON THOSE OF MY COMRADES
AT THE TIME THAT I DEFENDED ELKINS BEFORE QUANTRELL I KNEW THAT STEVE'S SYMPATHIES WERE WITH THE NORTH AND HAD HEARD THAT HE HAD JOINED THE FEDERAL ARMY
THEY KEPT HOY AT LEAVENWORTH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND THEN HANGED HIM
A DUEL AND AN AUCTION 20
THERE WAS LITTLE DOUBT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR CONVICTION AND UNDER THE LAW AS IT STOOD THEN AN ACCUSED MURDERER WHO PLEADED GUILTY WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE DEATH PENALTY
AFTER LEXINGTON QUANTRELL WENT WITH THE COMMAND AS FAR AS THE OSAGE RIVER AND THEN WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS OFFICERS CAME UP THE KANSAS LINE AGAIN TO SETTLE SOME OLD SCORES WITH THE JAYHAWKERS
UPTON B
AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS IT BEHOOVES US TO STOCK UP WITH THE QUALITIES OF MIND AND CHARACTER THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE TRAIL BEHIND US
OF THAT MAD RIDE INTO THE CAMP I REMEMBER LITTLE EXCEPT THAT I HAD MY HORSE GOING AT FULL TILT BEFORE I CAME INTO THE LINE OF FIRE
9 THAT WE BE GIVEN TWO DAYS IN WHICH TO PLEAD
THERE HAD BEEN SCRIMMAGES BACK AND FORTH OVER THE KANSAS LINE SINCE 1855
AND THAT DAY HALL AND JUDGE BUTTS TOOK US IN A SLEIGH DOWN TOWN TO THE COUNTY JAIL WHERE WE REMAINED THREE OR FOUR WEEKS
THE GATE AT THE FAIR GROUNDS WAS ROBBED THAT FALL
FOR INSTANCE
FOUR ABREAST THE COLUMN DASHED INTO THE TOWN WITH THE CRY
WHO CARED FOR YOU IN THE YEARS OF HELPLESS INFANCY
THEY OVERTOOK US ABOUT FOUR MILES WEST OF SHIELDSVILLE AND SHOTS WERE EXCHANGED WITHOUT EFFECT ON EITHER SIDE
WATCH WAS BEING KEPT FOR ME AT EVERY RAILROAD STATION AND THE ONLY SCHOOL I COULD REACH WAS THE SCHOOL OF WAR CLOSE AT HOME
GEORGE S
PARTIES
THE DETAILS OF THIS REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE WERE PATHETIC IN THE EXTREME EQUALLED ONLY BY THE DEATH OF MY YOUNG BROTHER BOB
HOW MUCH WOULD I GIVE THEM FOR INDORSING OR SIGNING A PETITION FOR A PARDON
SUSPECTING HOWEVER THAT HE WOULD DO SO WE WERE SOON ON THE MOVE AND THAT NIGHT WE EVADED THE GUARD AT THE BLUE EARTH RIVER BRIDGE AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT MADE OUR WAY THROUGH MANKATO
ASKER A NEIGHBOR OF THE JAMES BOYS PROCEEDED TO THEIR HOME NEAR KEARNEY AND THREW A BOMB INTO THE HOUSE WHERE THE FAMILY WAS SEATED
WILL YOU THREE BOYS TAKE CARE OF MRS DODD AND THE WOMEN COLE ANSWERED
HE WAS FOR THE UNION IN SPITE OF HIS NATURAL INCLINATIONS TO SYMPATHY WITH THE SOUTH
MAKING OUR WAY OUT TO NAPOLEON AND WELLINGTON WE GOT NEW COATS AND GLOVES AND ALSO LOCATED SOME OF THE RED SHEEPSKIN LEGGINGS WORN BY THE RED-LEG SCOUTS WITH WHICH WE MADE A TRIP OVER INTO WHAT WAS KNOWN AS HELL'S CORNER ON THE MISSOURI NEAR INDEPENDENCE
THERE AIN'T NO USE OF SWEARIN AND CUSSIN AT YOUR LUCK CAUSE YOU CAN'T CORRECT YOUR TROUBLES MORE THAN YOU CAN DROWN A DUCK
WHILE ON THIS EXPEDITION WE HAD A BRIEF TILT WITH COMANCHES BUT IN THE COUNTRY WHICH GEN
TEMPLE A
HE HAS RIBBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH GEMS FIT TO DECK THE BROWS OF SCIENCE ELOQUENCE AND ART
MY SISTERS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS AS WERE THE GIRLS OF OTHER FAMILIES WHOSE SONS HAD GONE TO JOIN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY THEIR CAPTORS HOPING BY THIS MEANS TO FRIGHTEN THE SOUTHERN BOYS INTO SURRENDER
ANOTHER SPECTRE THAT ROSE TO HAUNT MY LAST DAYS IN PRISON AND LONG STOOD BETWEEN MY PAROLE AND FINAL PARDON WAS THE STORY OF ONE JOHN MCMATH A CORPORAL IN AN INDIANA CAVALRY COMPANY IN PLEASANTON'S COMMAND THAT I HAD MALTREATED HIM WHEN HE LAY WOUNDED ON THE BATTLE FIELD CLOSE BY THE BIG BLUE NEAR MY OLD HOME IN JACKSON COUNTY
I NEVER WOULD PLAY IN A GAME WHERE BOB WAS
ONE PLACE WE GOT A CHICKEN AND COOKED IT ONLY TO BE INTERRUPTED BEFORE WE COULD HAVE OUR FEAST HAVING TO MAKE A QUICK DASH FOR COVER

THE NURSE OF JAYHAWKERS JARRETTE LAWRENCE BY ALL MEANS MY BROTHER-IN-LAW ANSWERED
NEITHER JOHN NOR MYSELF WAS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME UNTIL SEVERAL DAYS AFTER
THE YOUNGERS CAME FROM STRASBURG AND HELPED TO RULE THERE WHEN IT WAS A FREE CITY
FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RAID GEN
THE COMMANDER TALKED VERY FREELY WITH US ABOUT QUANTRELL TODD HALLER YOUNGER BLUNT POOL AND OTHER GUERRILLAS OF WHOM HE HAD HEARD
IT DEVELOPED AFTER THE SHOOTING THAT THE SAME RUSSELL WHO HAD OPENED FIRE ON JOHN HAD PLACED THE GUARD OVER THE HORSES AND THAT CAPT

AND NOW MAY WE REQUEST THAT YOU PUT A LIGHTNING-ROD ON THE CHURCH TO SECURE IT AGAINST LIGHTNING THE GIVER REPLIED
MINE WAS A HAPPY CHILDHOOD
MINE WAS A HAPPY CHILDHOOD
HOW MANY MANY TIMES THE WORDS OF THE POET HAVE SUNG TO MY SOUL DURING THE PAST TWENTY-SIX YEARS
WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING AND LEADS MEN SOMETIMES OUT OF THE COMMON AVENUES OF LIFE
THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS WE SPENT THERE GATHERING AND DRIVING CATTLE MY SISTER JOINING US AND KEEPING HOUSE FOR US AT SYENE DALLAS COUNTY WHERE WE MADE OUR HEADQUARTERS
THIS WAS ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER I HAD LEFT MISSOURI AND WHILE I WAS 1,500 MILES AWAY YET THIS HIDEOUS CHARGE WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF CHIEF JUSTICE START OF MINNESOTA IN 1896 BY A MINNEAPOLIS NEWSPAPER
I DO NOT BELIEVE HE SAID THAT THERE ARE ANY REAL TRUE WOMEN LIVING ANY MORE THE GUEST OPPOSITE HIM SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SHOUTED
IT WAS A ROBBERY AND MURDER BY ONE OF THESE BANDS OF KANSAS JAYHAWKERS THAT GAVE TO THE CIVIL WAR QUANTRELL THE CHIEF OF THE GUERRILLAS
FREE AGAIN JIM'S TRAGIC DEATH BROUGHT THE YOUNGERS AGAIN INTO THE PUBLIC EYE AND ASIDE FROM ANY EFFORT ON MY PART THERE WAS A RENEWED DISCUSSION OF THE ADVISABILITY OF EXTENDING A FULL PARDON TO ME THE LONE SURVIVOR OF THE BAND WHO HAD INVADED NORTHFIELD
AS FAR BACK AS 1862 FRANK JAMES AND I FORMED A FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAS EXISTED TO THIS DAY
WELL MEANING TOO BUT UNFORTUNATE WAS THE DECLARATION OF MISSOURI FRIENDS IN MINNESOTA THAT THEY COULD RAISE $100,000 TO GET US OUT OF STILLWATER
