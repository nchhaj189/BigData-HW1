FOR THAT COREY HUMORED HIS GUEST'S WISH FOR PRIVACY
RIGHT NOW I PROBABLY HAVE SIX DEATH WARRANTS OUT ON ME AND ABOUT AS MUCH CHANCE OF MAKING A LIVING AS I'LL STICK TO MY CHANCES
WHEN THEY FINALLY STOPPED THEY WERE BESIDE A SMALL BATTERED SPACE SHIP
CAPTAIN BRUCE GORDON WITH TWO PRISONERS--BODYGUARDS OF CAPTAIN JURGENS HE REPORTED TO THE THREE MEN IN BRIGHT NEW LEGAL UNIFORM WHO WERE APPROACHING WARILY
HE BENT HER BACK OVER HIS KNEE UNTIL A MANGLED MOAN WAS COMING FROM HER SPEAKER
THEN HE REMEMBERED AT LAST
THE HAND THAT HAD BEEN REACHING FOR THE KNIFE YANKED THE WEAPON OUT AND BROUGHT IT UP SHARPLY
IN SPITE OF HIS BETTER JUDGMENT SHE CAUGHT HIS EYES AND DREW THEM DOWN OVER CURVES AND SWELLS THAT WOULD ALWAYS BE RIGHT FOR AROUSING A MAN'S PASSION
AND AT THAT DISTANCE IT WAS HARD TO MISS
WAYNE YOU'RE UNDER ARREST TRENCH MOVED FORWARD HIS HANDS IN THE AIR BUT WITH NO MARK OF SURPRISE OR FEAR ON HIS FACE
THEN HE RECOGNIZED HER--SHEILA COREY
YOU WERE TRYING TO KILL ME THEN SO YOU BURNED IT TO KEEP JURGENS FROM GETTING IT AND PUTTING THE FINGER ON ME
HE WAITED IN LINE
HE HIT THE HEAVY DOOR WITH HIS SHOULDER AND CRASHED THROUGH WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE
THEY HAD PRESENTED SOME SORT OF PAPER AND FORCED THE GUARD TO LET THEM THROUGH
GORDON REMEMBERED THE CONTRABAND SHIPMENT OF GUNS AND COMPARED IT TO THE INCREASE HE'D NOTICED IN WEAPONS AND TO THE IMPOSSIBLE PRICES THE PUSHERS WERE DEMANDING
THE WHEEL HESITATED AND CAME TO A HALT WITH THE BALL TREMBLING IN A POCKET
TWO OTHER MEN WERE ALREADY IN THE SURPRISINGLY WELL-FURNISHED ROOM AT THE LITTLE TABLE SET UP NEAR THE WINDOW
FORGET ALL YOU'RE THINKING CUDDLES
WHEN YOU SET OUT TO TINHORN A LIVING YOU'RE A CROOK
THE MESSAGE MURDOCH TOOK ANOTHER SWALLOW OF BRANDY
FOR A SECOND SHE TENSED WHILE HE WAITED GRINNING DOWN AT HER
TAKE IT
THE LITTLE MAN WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE BUNK IN HIS CLOTHES FILTHY
HE INSPECTED THE FORGED WORK PAPERS AND JERKED HIS THUMB TOWARD ONE OF THE HASTILY BUILT CELLS WHERE A DOCTOR WOULD LOOK O'NEILL OVER--EVENTUALLY
THAT'S HOW I GOT MY BEAT SO FAST IN THE SEVENTH
AND THE MUNICIPALS HAD IMPOSED NEW TAXES AGAIN
BRUCE GORDON JUMPED FORWARD BRINGING HIS FOOT UP IN A SAVAGE SWING BUT SHE'D ROLLED AND THE BLOW ONLY GLANCED AGAINST HER RIBS
HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD JERKING HIS HANDS UP AND PUTTING HIS EARTH-ADAPTED SHOULDERS BEHIND IT
I GOTTA HAVE SOME OF THAT FOR MYSELF GORDON GRIMACED
WHAT'S HE HANGED FOR HOARDING A VOICE ANSWERED AND OTHERS SUPPLIED THE FEW DETAILS
YOU'D DO IT
IZZY NODDED APPROVAL
OUTSIDE THE DOME THE ELECTRIC MOTOR CARRIED THEM ALONG AT A STEADY TWENTY MILES AN HOUR ALMOST SILENTLY
OR THE NEW COMMISSIONER CRANE
WITH THE COPS BUSY FIGHTING EACH OTHER THIS WAS BETTER PICKINGS THAN OUTSIDE THE DOME
HIS FINGERS CLUMSY AND UNCERTAIN GROPED BACK AND FORTH FOR A BADGE THAT WASN'T THERE
APPARENTLY SHE HADN'T NOTICED THAT HE HAD REVIVED THOUGH HER EYES WERE ON HIM
HE LOOKED BRUCE GORDON OVER SOURLY
THEY'D GIVEN BRUCE GORDON HIS FINAL ASSIGNMENT
ALL RIGHT YOU CAN LOOK AT MY BOOKS
OR DOPE RUNNING WHATEVER COMES TO HAND GOV'NOR
HE SAW SMALL VILLAGES WHERE CROP PROSPECTORS AND HYDROPONIC FARMERS LIVED WITH A FEW SMALL INDUSTRIAL SECTIONS SCATTERED OVER THE DESERT
UH THE DOOR HEAVED OPEN THEN AND SHE APPEARED IN IT
HE SAW A BIG GRAY CAR COMING UP THE STREET
THE COOP IS FULL AND THEY NEEDED ROOMS--AND I COULDN'T TELL THEM THAT--THAT FORGET IT HE TOLD HER
BUT IT MADE MORE SENSE THIS WAY AT THAT
VERY CONVENIENT THE OLD MAN SAID
EVEN IN JAIL A MAN HAD TO HAVE SMOKES
HELL HE SAID IN DISGUST
IT WAS RARE ENOUGH TO HAVE A GUN HERE
YOU GOTTA ALL RIGHT GORDON ADMITTED
I'VE BEEN OPERATING IN THE DARK
SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED MEN WITH GUTS
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS RAW BEFORE
RANDOLPH FROWNED OVER HIS CARDS
BUT THE DOME WASN'T DESIGNED TO STAND STRAY BULLETS
AND I JUST MADE IT TOO THE MOB WAS BEGINNING TO BREAK UP NOW BUT IT WAS STILL IN AN UGLY MOOD
HE YANKED OUT THE BIT OF NOTEBOOK AND SNIFFED
WAYNE APPARENTLY LET THE PAPER STAY IN BUSINESS TO GIVE HIMSELF A TALKING POINT ABOUT FAIR PLAY
SHEILA WAS STARING AT HIM AS HE SHUCKED OFF HIS OUTER CLOTHES MECHANICALLY AND CRAWLED UNDER THE BLANKET
THEY EDGED FORWARD UNTIL THEY COULD MAKE OUT THE SHAPE OF THE FIGHT GOING ON
A GOOD CLUBBING BEATS HANGING HE TOLD THEM
ONE HUDDLED UNDER ITS DOME FOREVER AFRAID OF LOSING THAT PROTECTION AND HAVING TO FACE THE LIFE THE OTHER LED
THE GIANT WAS SPUN AROUND SOMEHOW
BY MIDNIGHT AS IZZY HAD PROMISED THE PEOPLE HAD BEGUN TO QUIET DOWN HOWEVER
RUNNING OUTER MARSPORT
I TOLD YOU I HAD TO DO IT
TRENCH COUNTED THE MONEY AND PUT IT AWAY
THE GROWERS WOULD STARVE NEXT YEAR IF THEY GAVE IT ALL AWAY NOW
WATER WENT UP FROM FOURTEEN CREDITS TO EIGHTY CREDITS FOR A GALLON OF PURE DISTILLED
HE HAD COUNTED ON AT LEAST SOME REGRET FROM MOTHER COREY HOWEVER
THEY HIRED OUT MEMBERS TO OTHER GANGS DURING THE FREQUENT WARS
THEN HE STIFFENED
BUT IT AIN'T LIKELY HE GRINNED IN SATISFACTION
TAKE TOMORROW OFF IF YOU WANT AND I'LL FIX CREDIT FOR YOU
CONVOY DUTY IZZY
HE GOT OFF TO PUZZLE OUT A SWITCH USING MOTHER COREY'S SCRAWLED INSTRUCTIONS
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES TO GET INTO COVERALLS AND HELMET AND OUT THROUGH THE AIRLOCK GORDON NEEDED LESS THAN THAT
IT HURT TO SEE THAT WHAT HE'D CONSIDERED HARDHEADEDNESS WAS JUST ANOTHER CASE OF A FOOL FIGHTING DRAGONS WITH A PAPER SWORD
PERIODICALLY DURING THE SHIFT REPLACEMENTS TOOK THEIR PLACE MAKING SURE THAT HE WAS NEVER BY HIMSELF
THEN HE PULLED THE CROOK INSIDE THE STORE
HI GOV'NOR HE CALLED OUT HIS VOICE STILL CHEERFUL
I'M ALL PACKED SHE SAID
NEARLY EVERYONE ELSE ALREADY HAD THEM SHOWING
BRUCE GORDON LEANED FORWARD WITH IZZY'S HANDS GRABBING FOR HIM
WE'VE GOT A DOZEN PLANS
I DON'T KNOW HE TURNED TOWARD SHEILA--A SPLIT SECOND TOO LATE
GORDON WENT DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT THROUGH THE SEAL ONTO THE STREET ENTRANCE STILL IN THE SHADOWS
YOU JUST RAN INTO THE SACRED LAW OF MARSPORT--THE ONE THEY TEACH KIDS
HE'D MANAGED TO TAP MOST OF THE PLACES BEFORE HIS RELIEF SHOWED
THE ODOR GORDON HAD SMELLED BEFORE REGISTERED
BUT IT HAS TO BE GOOD
OUT ON THE STREET A SUDDEN WHOOPING BEGAN AND HE GLANCED DOWN
HE SWALLOWED THE FAST-ACTING DRUG AND SAT UP TRYING TO REMEMBER
THEY'LL GROW UP TO BE OLD MAIDS THAT WAY FURY BLACKENED HER FACE BUT SHE STILL COULDN'T FUNCTION
THEN YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO BE IN THIS MESS
AS HE WATCHED A POMPOUS LITTLE MAN CAME TO THE UPPER WINDOW OVER THE DOOR AND BEGAN MOTIONING FOR ATTENTION
THE MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCE IS DISBANDED AND THE LEGAL POLICE FORCE IS NOW BEING ORGANIZED
THE DOME MADE MARSPORT AND IT'S TABOO GORDON NODDED
GORDON WAS SWEATING SLIGHTLY AS HE STOOD AT THE ROULETTE TABLE WHERE BOTH ZERO AND DOUBLE-ZERO WERE RESERVED FOR THE HOUSE
I'VE BEEN GOING OUT NIGHTS TO HELP THE CITIZENS ORGANIZE AGAINST THE STONEWALL GANG
THE GIRL WAS OUT FROM UNDER HIS KNEE AT THE FIRST RELAXATION OF PRESSURE
AND UP THE STREET A MAN IN BRIGHT GREEN UNIFORM WAS POUNDING HIS FIST UP AND DOWN IN EMPHASIS AS HE CALLED IN OVER THE PRECINCT BOX
NEXT TIME DON'T BE A FOOL
HE WAS STILL WHEEZING ASTHMATICALLY BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANGE IN THE RHYTHM OF HIS BREATHING
HE SHRUGGED
ENOUGH TO BUY A CORPORAL'S JOB PAY FOR YOUR SUIT AND MAYBE GET BY HE DECIDED
SO YOU'RE BOUND FOR MARS RATHER THAN THE MERCURY MINES
NOW HE HAD NO WITNESSES EXCEPT SHEILA COREY
HE THREADED HIS WAY BETWEEN TWO OF THE TRUCKS
WE'D BETTER GET BACK TO FATS AND TELL HIM THE SWINDLER GOT AWAY GORDON FOLLOWED THEM OUT AND TURNED SOUTH DOWN THE STREET TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE DOME AND THE ENTRANCE WHERE HE'D PARKED HIS AIRSUIT AND HELMET
WE FIGURE COMMUNITY KITCHENS CAN STRETCH THINGS A BIT MORE
THEY DRAGGED OUT THE STOREKEEPER HIS WIFE AND YOUNG DAUGHTER AND PRESSED THEM INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PARADE
MARSPORT IS STRICTLY ARTIFICIAL
AND BESIDE HIM STOOD SHEILA WITH ONE HAND RESTING ON THE MAN'S ELBOW
HE FOUND IZZY AND RANDOLPH AT THE RESTAURANT ACROSS FROM MOTHER COREY'S
DRINKING COSTS TOO MUCH FOR WHAT I MAKE
MURDOCH NODDED FAINTLY
THEN SHE HESITATED
GORDON CLIMBED INTO THE ENCLOSED CAB AND PULLED BACK QUESTIONINGLY ON THE ONLY LEVER HE COULD SEE
OR ELSE TAKE A BATH MOTHER COREY CHUCKLED AND WHEEZED HIS WAY UP OUT OF THE CHAIR EXCHANGING PLACES WITH GORDON
THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH FOR TWO IN MY PLACE--AND I GUESS MOTHER COREY WON'T MIND
HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF AS HE HEADED OVER THE RUBBLE TOWARD THE PREVIOUSLY DOMED SECTION
SHE COMES INTO MY HOUSE AND I SNEAK BEHIND HER
PAPA IS SICK
BUT IT WAS A QUARTER AFTER THREE ALREADY HE WAS PRACTICALLY BROKE--AND HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE SHE COULD BE FOUND
SHEILA STARTED TO MAKE COFFEE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND HEADED FOR THE BED
I'M JUST HALF SANE INSTEAD OF ALL INSANE FOR A CHANGE HE GOT UP PACING THE FLOOR AS HE TALKED
I GUESS I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY
THE WHINE WAS ENTIRELY MISSING FROM HIS VOICE NOW THOUGH HIS FACE SEEMED AS EXPRESSIONLESS AS EVER
THEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE FOOD HE MADE A LUNGE GRABBED IT AND HARDLY WAITED TO GET IT THROUGH THE SLITS OF HIS SUIT BEFORE GULPING IT DOWN
AND THEY MUST HAVE PAID HALF THE GRAFT THEY'VE TAKEN FOR THAT
SO FAR SECURITY HAS PLAYED ONE NATION AGAINST ANOTHER ENOUGH TO KEEP ANY FROM DARING TO SWIPE POWER ON THE PLANETS
THE LEGAL FORCES WERE SHORTHANDED AND EAGER FOR RECRUITS
MURDOCH MUST HAVE DISREGARDED THE ORDER BUT THE REST OF THE FORCE HAD BEEN BUSY HELPING THE ADMINISTRATION
WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN UP AN ALLEY BETWEEN MCCUTCHEON AND MILES GORDON TOLD HIM
THE PLACE HAD BEEN CLEANED UP MORE THAN HE HAD EXPECTED AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN NEW PLANTS INSTALLED BESIDE THE BLOWER SINCE THE AIR WAS SOMEWHAT FRESHER
AS LONG AS HIS OPPONENTS WERE SLOWER OR LESS RUTHLESS HE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
THE FORMER LEADER OF THE STONEWALL GANG STARED UP AT THE CLUB SWINGING FROM GORDON'S WRIST
PROVIDED THE FIRST SHIPMENT CARRIES THE MOST WE CAN GET FOR THE CREDITS I BROUGHT IT WILL--WE'VE GOT SOME STUFF THAT'S ABOUT TO SPOIL AND WE CAN LET YOU HAVE A WHOLE TRAIN OF IT HE TOOK THE SACK OF CREDITS AND TOSSED IT TOWARD A DRAWER UNCOUNTED
THAT VAGUE PROMISE BY SECURITY WAS SO MUCH HOGWASH
THE CREDIT ON THE DOPE HAD PAID FOR MOST OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS
CITIZENS WERE INSTRUCTED NOT TO CO-OPERATE
THE HUGE LEGS PUMPED STEADILY AND THE GREAT ARMS WERE REACHING OUT TO FLAIL ASIDE CLUBS AND KNIVES
HE BROUGHT HIS SHOULDERS UP AND HIS HEAD DOWN
SO THERE REALLY IS A SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE HE SAID
THEN THEY REACHED A DEAD END WITH JUST ROOM FOR THEM TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE TRUCK AND INTO AN ENTRANCE MARKED WITH A BIG NOTICE OF PRIVACY
BECAUSE EVERY TIME ONE OF MY MEN SEES ONE OF YOU THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN
THEN A WAVE OF FURY SEEMED TO WASH OVER THEM AT THE NEEDLESS RISK TO THE SAFETY OF ALL
HE CAME OUT IN THE TRUCKYARD AND BEGAN SEARCHING
BUT OUT HERE NOBODY THINKS OF EARTH AS A PLACE TO YELL TO FOR HELP SO THEY MISSED
THEN HE LAUGHED ROUGHLY
CAN'T TRUST EM GORDON STARED AT THE OLD MAN BUT HE APPARENTLY MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID
THE KNOTS WERE TIGHT BUT GORDON MANAGED TO GET HIS KNIFE UNDER THE ROPE AROUND MURDOCH'S WRISTS AND SLICE THROUGH IT
HE CHANGED HIS LUNGE IN MID-STRIDE AND BROUGHT HIS ARM BACK WITH THE KNIFE
GORDON FELT SOMETHING HIT HIS BACK AND INSTINCTIVELY FELL SOAKING UP THE BLOW
THEY GO CRAZY FOR A WHILE BUT GIVE EM A FEW HOURS AND THEY STOP MOST OF IT
HE'D LEARNED BY NOW THAT THE NATIVE MARTIANS--THOSE WHO'D BEEN HERE FOR AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS OR HAD BEEN BORN HERE--WERE BACKING A REFORM CANDIDATE AND NEW TICKET
THERE WAS ALSO A SMALL IRON LYING BESIDE A PILE OF HIS LAUNDERED CLOTHES
THEY WENT UP TO GORDON'S HOLE-IN-THE-WALL WITH MOTHER COREY WHEEZING BEHIND WHILE THE ROTTEN WOOD OF THE STAIRS GROANED UNDER HIS GROTESQUE BULK
I CAME OUT TO TELL YOU I GOT THE SWEETEST BEAT IN MARSPORT--OVER A DOZEN GAMBLING JOINTS ON IT--AND I NEED A RIGHT GEE TO WORK IT WITH ME
THERE WAS THE SOFTNESS OF A BED UNDER HIM AND THE BITTER AFTERTASTE OF MIGRAINOL ON HIS TONGUE
IT WAS THE BIGGEST DOME EVER BUILT--LARGE ENOUGH TO COVER ALL OF MARSPORT BEFORE THE SLUMS SPRAWLED OUT BEYOND IT
THE MAN OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T AFFORD FIFTY CREDITS A WEEK
UNDER THE HUGE DOME THAT ENCLOSED THE MAIN PART OF THE CITY THE HEAVIER AIR PRESSURE PERMITTED NORMAL TRAVEL OF SOUND
HE STEPPED BACK TO HIS FORMER SPOT CATCHING HIS BREATH AND DIGGING FRANTICALLY FOR HIS KNIFE
HE BEGAN DIRECTLY
NOW BEAT IT GORDON GOT OUT OF THE CAR THE KID WAS DRIVING AND STARTED TOWARD THE ENTRANCE JUST AS THE MOANING WAIL OF THE CROWD BEHIND HIM BUILT UP
HE'D ALWAYS OBJECTED TO THE NICKNAME BUT IT MADE A GOOD CODE
HENNESSY GET THE CORPSE TO THE MORGUE AND MARK IT DOWN AS A ROBBERY ATTEMPT
HONEST IZZY THAT'S ME
SOMEBODY TOLD ME YOU'D JOINED SECURITY AND GOT BANGED UP TRYING TO KEEP TRENCH FROM BLOWING UP THE DOME
DOME WARNING IZZY SHOUTED IN HIS EAR
SHEILA WAS HOLDING THE DOOR OF A LARGE THREE-WHEELER OPEN
HE HAD TO GET TO HER
BUT TO GORDON'S TRAINED EYES THERE WAS PLENTY OF OUTRIGHT ROTTENNESS TOO
GOOD LUCK GORDON--AND DAMN IT WE'RE--WE GOTTA EAT DON'T WE
COMES THE REVOLUTION AND WE'LL ALL EAT STRAWBERRIES AND SCREAM
HE MADE HIS COLLECTIONS EARLY
THE SHOCK WAVE HIT GORDON KNOCKING HIM FROM HIS FEET INTO THE CROWD AROUND HIM
SOME OF THE VERY POOR STUMBLING ABOUT AND HOPING FOR A DRINK SOMEHOW
IT WAS THE EIGHTH DAY WHEN HE LED THEM OUT IN THE EARLY DAWN
EVEN THE COPS ARE AFRAID TO GO IN THERE
WE GOT ENOUGH SO MOST PEOPLE WON'T STARVE TO DEATH FOR ANOTHER WEEK I GUESS
XIII ARREST MAYOR WAYNE
HE SWUNG HIS GRAY CAR UP TO THE ALLEY IN SEVEN MINUTES
THE GRAY-SPECKLED HEAD RELAXED AND ROLLED SIDEWAYS ON THE BLOODY PILLOW
MADE UP MY MIND THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CLEANUP IN MARSPORT EVEN IF WAYNE DOES WIN
FROM THE STAIRS A SUDDEN CRY AND THUMP SOUNDED AND SOMETHING HIT THE FLOOR
NOW SEEMING TO STAND BY HABIT ALONE IT RADIATED DESOLATION AND DECAY
I'LL SIGN YOUR DAMNED PAPERS TEN MINUTES LATER HE STOOD IN WHAT WAS NOW A CONNECTING DOUBLE ROOM WATCHING MOTHER COREY NAIL UP THE HALL DOOR TO THE ROOM THAT WAS TO BE HERS
THEY CAME TO THE GRAY THREE-STORY BUILDING THAT MOTHER COREY NOW OWNED
AND AT LAST THE KID CAME BACK
IN THE THIN AIR HIS LUNGE WAS SILENT AND HE WAS GRABBING HER BEFORE SHE KNEW HE WAS UP
BUT NOT FOOLS
I CAN'T SAY IT EITHER GOV'NOR--BUT SOME DAY I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE BADGES MYSELF
GORDON DROPPED INTO HIS SEAT WHILE THE SOUNDS OUTSIDE INDICATED TAKE-OFF TIME
OUTSIDE IT WAS THE USUAL MARTIAN NIGHT IN THE POORER SECTION OF THE DOME WHICH MEANT NEAR-DARKNESS
HIS WHOLE MIND WAS CONCENTRATED DOWN TO A SINGLE POINT
NOT MUCH ROOM WITH MY STUFF AND RANDOLPH'S BUT IT BEATS WALKING WHAT IN HELL BRINGS YOU BACK GORDON ASKED
AT THE OTHER END A PAIR OF FIGURES SKULKED ALONG TRYING THE DOOR OF EACH HOUSE THEY PASSED
HE PICKED HIS WAY DOWN ALLEYS AND SMALL STREETS
GORDON SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT RANDOLPH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SEEMED TO BE IZZY'S FRIEND
THE CROWDS OF FOREMEN AND DELIVERYMEN WHO'D BE GOING IN AND OUT THROUGH THE DAY WERE LACKING
THE READERS ARE PUT AWAY FOR OLD-TIMES SAKE RANDOLPH SHRUGGED AND WENT ON AS IF HE HADN'T INTERRUPTED HIMSELF
FOR THIS STINKING PLANET I GUESS YOU'RE SOMETHING OF A SAINT
I'D LIKE TO COME ALONG WITH YOU TO OBSERVE BUT I WOULDN'T MAKE ANY CHOICE BETWEEN WAYNE AND NOLAN DOWNSTAIRS THE REAR ROOM WAS LOCKED WITH ONE OF MOTHER COREY'S GUARDS AT THE DOOR
BUT HE WAS TOO BUSY TO WORRY ABOUT IT
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOM
M-U-R-T-A-G-H
WAYNE ARLISS AND THE REST OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD COUNTED ON SELF-INTEREST HOLDING MOST OF THE COPS LOYAL TO THEM
HE'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT MARSPORT WAS THE CENTER OF A THINLY POPULATED AREA STRETCHING FOR A THOUSAND MILES IN ALL DIRECTIONS BEYOND THE CITY CONNECTED BY THE WINDING LINK OF THE ELECTRIC MONORAIL
THEN IT HIT HIM SLOWLY AND HE LOOKED UP
THEN THE SIREN HOOTED AGAIN A LONG STEADY BLAST
COME ALONG AND WE'LL BOTH APPLY FOR THAT JOB--AFTER I GET MY STUFF HE MIGHT AS WELL JOIN THE LAW
OKAY FATTY
SICK DO YOU HEAR
IZZY STARTED FORWARD BUT GORDON PULLED HIM BACK AS THE COPS REACHED FOR THEIR WEAPONS
COME ON DOWN
OH DAMN IT
A MAN GETS TIRED OF BEING RESPECTABLE COBBER
THEY NEVER MADE THE LOOTING RAID
YOU LOOK BEAT
HE CRUSHED THE PAPER SLOWLY TEARING IT TO BITS WITH HIS CLENCHED HANDS
MOTHER COREY HAD TOO MANY CHEAP HOODS AMONG HIS FRIENDS TO BE FOOLED WITH
OKAY MY MISTAKE
WOULDN'T BE HONEST GOV'NOR
TRENCH KEPT HIS EYES ON IT HIS FACE FILLED WITH SUSPICION AND THE VAGUE FEAR MOST MEN HAD FOR SECURITY
THEN WE'RE TAKEN
HOW MANY HE FROWNED SUDDENLY AS GORDON COUNTED OUT THREE BILLS
THEY PASSED A CROWD AROUND A CRUDE GALLOWS AND SCHULBERG STOPPED
I GOT ME IN FIFTY GALLONS OF WATER TODAY AND TOMORROW I DO JUST THAT
HE TRIED TO PULL HIS FOOT OFF THE BUTTON THAT WAS CONCEALED IN THE FLOOR
AS GORDON SLIPPED THE LOOP OVER HIS WRIST AGAIN ONE OF THE NEW CAPTAIN'S HANDS GROPED SEEKING A BUTTON ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK
BUT IT WAS A SPRAWLING CRESCENT AROUND THE CENTRAL SECTION HARDER TO HANDLE THAN THE MUNICIPAL TERRITORY
WE SENT TWENTY OTHERS THE SAME WAY--AND THEY FAILED
THE LOSS WAS ONLY A TINY DENT IN HIS NEW PILE BUT GORDON BEMOANED IT PROPERLY--AS IF HE WERE BROKE--AND MOVED OVER TO THE BAR
YOU SWEEP ME OFF MY FEET
MARS WAS LEAVING HIM WHAT HE'D BROUGHT
HE SAW STORES BEING BROKEN INTO BEYOND HIS BEAT
AND WHILE IT LASTED AT LEAST MARSPORT WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE ITS FACE LIFTED
MOTHER COREY'S FREE HAND CAME AROUND IN AN OPEN-PALMED SLAP THAT LIFTED THE COLLECTOR UP FROM THE FLOOR AND SENT HIM REELING BACK AGAINST A WALL
GET HIM SHE YELLED
IT WASN'T THAT THE PANEL SLAMMED SHUT
YOU GOT A BARGAIN CUDDLES HE SAID
THEY WERE IN THE SLUMS AROUND THE CITY NOW
I'LL SEE THAT THEY KNOW YOU WEREN'T GUILTY THOUGH
YOU WERE A BIT DRASTIC--THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT--BUT WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO KEEPING NATIONALISM OFF THE PLANETS AND THAT'S ALL WE CARE ABOUT I WONDER IF IT'S WORTH IT GORDON SAID SLOWLY
IF YOU'RE A DEPORTEE IT SHOULD SHOW UP
IF THEY GIVE IT TO YOU MARS IS THAT MUCH RICHER
YOU'VE LOST FIFTY POUNDS AND THINGS ARE A MITE TOUGH OUT HERE PRINCESS
TRENCH WAS TUMBLING FORWARD TO AVOID THE SHOT BUT HE TWITCHED AS A BULLET CREASED HIS SHOULDER
IF I'VE GOT TO MARRY YOU TO KEEP YOU OUT OF MY HAIR I WILL HER FACE WAS PASTY-WHITE BUT SHE BENT HER HEAD AND FLUTTERED HER EYELASHES UP AT HIM
IT'S NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO ADJUST HERE AND IT'S AFRAID TO TRY MAYBE SHE AGREED DOUBTFULLY
THE WOMAN NODDED
WE NEED A FOURTH GORDON STARTED TO PROTEST THAT HE WAS TIRED AND NEEDED HIS SLEEP
HE REMOVED HIS HELMET AND STRAPPED IT TO THE BACK OF HIS SUIT OUT OF THE WAY
BLACKMAIL BRUCE
THEIR HOME TERRITORY REACHED NEARLY TO MOTHER COREY'S BEFORE IT RAN INTO THE NO MAN'S LAND SEPARATING IT FROM THE GANG OF NICK THE CROOP
HE TRIED TO SWALLOW THEM WITH THE DREGS OF HIS COFFEE AND THEY STUCK IN HIS THROAT
OWEN MURTAGH OF 738 MORRISY PROTEST THE WAYNE MAN CUT OFF THE FRANTIC WRIGGLING OF THE NOLAN CHECKER'S FINGER TOWARD THE LINE IN THE BOOK
HE STARED AT SHEILA
AND WHERE THE DOME HAD BEEN A CLAP OF THUNDER SEEMED TO TAKE VISIBLE FORM
WE'VE STUDIED THESE THINGS
GORDON THRUST THE DAMNING BADGE AS DEEP INTO HIS POUCH AS HE COULD CRAM IT AND LOOKED OUT
MOTHER COREY STOOD STARING AT THE PACK WHILE BRUCE GORDON CHANGED OUT OF HIS AIRSUIT GAGGING FAINTLY AS THE FULL EFFLUVIUM OF THE PLACE HIT HIM
BUT AFTERWARDS HE'LL HAVE ME OUT
HE TORE THE ENVELOPE FROM SECURITY INTO TINY SHREDS TOO SMALL FOR MOTHER COREY TO MAKE SENSE OF AND WENT OUT TO MAIL THE LETTER FEELING THE FEW BILLS IN HIS POCKET
AT EXACTLY SUNDOWN THE ROCKET SHIPS HAD THROWN DOWN RAMPS AND A STREAM OF JEEPS HAD RIDDEN DOWN THEM AND TOWARD THE SOUTH ENTRANCE TO THE DOME
GORDON SHOVED THE BODIES OF THE TWO MEN ASIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE WRECK OF A MAN WHO LAY ON THE DIRTY BLANKET
GORDON WENT TO CONNECT A WIRE AND SWITCH FROM THE BATTERY AND COIL THEY HAD INSTALLED BUT JERKED BACKWARDS AS HE SAW A SUSPICIOUS GUARD STARING AT HIM
THE PRINTING ON IT LEAPED AT HIM
AND IF THAT BLOODY DOCTOR WON'T AGREE HE TURNED TOWARD THE DISPENSARY
THERE WAS A RUSTY BUCKET FOR WATER A HOLE KICKED THROUGH THE FLOOR FOR WASTE WATER
IT ISN'T
THERE WAS A FLICKER OF DAWNLIGHT IN THE SKY NOW HOWEVER
THE TWO THUGS HAD HELD BACK BUT NOW THEY BEGAN EDGING IN
MURDOCH CALLED WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDOCH TOLD HIM
IT CAUGHT HER SQUARELY UNDER THE CHIN AND SHE WENT DOWN AND OUT
NICE THINGS AROUND HIM GORDON FOUND WHAT HAD BEEN HIS OLD ROOM AND DUMPED HIS FEW THINGS INTO IT
GORDON I'VE GOT TO TALK--BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE
AND YOU'LL WANT SUITS
BUT WHY IN HELL SHOULD I
DEAD BECAUSE A CROOK HAD TO TRY HIS HAND ON A LOCK
A THOUSAND FOR A PLAIN COP FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOR A CORPORAL AND SO ON EACH CONTRIBUTING A THIRD OF IT NOW
WHEN I SAW THAT LEGAL COP READY TO TAKE YOU I HAD TO GO RUNNING OUT TO SAVE YOU
WELL I'LL GIVE IT A TRY
WELL HOW SOMETHING BANGED HEAVILY AGAINST THE ENTRANCE SEAL AND THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A HOT ARGUMENT FOLLOWED BY A COMMOTION OF SOME SORT
THE TWO MEN HOLDING WINNING TICKETS GET BUCKED UP TO SERGEANTS
I CAN GO IN THE DOME AND WALK AROUND JUST LIKE YOU HIS EYES WATERED AND A TEAR WENT DRIPPING DOWN HIS NOSE
GORDON WATCHED FOR A SIGN THAT TRENCH HAD PASSED ON HIS EVIDENCE OF THE MURDER OF MURDOCH BUT THERE WAS NONE
THERE WAS A NEARLY USED-UP LIPSTICK A COMB AND A CRACKED MIRROR
ROCKETS THAT FLAMED BRIGHT BLUE--MILITARY ROCKETS
I'VE STILL GOT THEM IF YOU DON'T INSIST HIS HANDS WHIPPED DOWN SAVAGELY TOWARD HIS HIPS AND CAME UP SHARPLY
BUT NOPE--FIFTY EVEN A NIGHT NO MORE
AND AFTER I TOOK A BATH TO CELEBRATE
WHY NOT SKIP THE MEETING
THE AIR WAS THICK WITH THEIR UNWASHED BODIES--ALL MARS SMELLED SINCE WATER WAS STILL TOO RARE FOR FREQUENT BATHING--AND THEIR CHEAP PERFUME AND CLOUDED WITH CHEAP MARSWEED CIGARETTES
GO IN FOR BUSINESS AND DON'T STOP JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER GUY QUITS
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT FATS PLACE WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE LIST
THE GIRL CAME UP FROM THE FLOOR WITH A SINGLE PUSH OF HER ARM
DROP A LETTER IN THE MAILBOX AND THE NEXT MORNING IT WOULD BE TURNED OVER TO COMMISSIONER ARLISS OFFICE
I DON'T COTTON TO SECURITY GORDON--BUT THOSE DEVILS IN THERE ARE MAKING OUR KIDS STARVE MOTHER COREY HEAVED HIS BULK UP SLOWLY WHEEZING AND INDICATED HIS CHAIR AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
NOW HE HELD IT OUT TOWARD GORDON
DEAD FIGHTING WIND-MILLS
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE TO BE A FAILURE AS A WOMAN--A WIFE BRUCE
WHEN HE WAS FINISHED HE TURNED TO TWO OF THE OTHER CAPTIVES
THEY SMACKED INTO THE TANGLE OF STAR POINT TRUCKS AND CAME TO A GRINDING HALT MEN PILING OUT READY FOR BATTLE
THEN HE GOT UP AND BEGAN PUTTING ON HIS UNIFORM AGAIN
IF JUST ONE OF YOU GETS WITHIN TEN FEET OF THE DOME OR ENTRANCE WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE DOME
THEY WANTED MEN WHO COULD SERVE THEM LOYALLY EVEN WITHOUT ORDERS
GET A BARKER OUT AT THE PORT RUN SPECIAL BUSSES CHARGE THE SUCKERS A MINT FOR A CHEAP THRILL GORDON GRINNED WRYLY
AND THE SIX FINAL PIECES THAT SPELLED HIS RISE FROM A SPECIAL REPORTER HELPING OUT WITH A POLICE SHAKE-UP COVERAGE THROUGH A REGULAR LEG-MAN TURNING UP RACKETS AND ON UP LIKE A METEOR UNTIL
AND YOU CAN PASS THE WORD ALONG THAT THE STONEWALL GANG IS DEAD HE TURNED AND MOVED OFF DOWN THE STREET THE OTHERS AT HIS SIDE
HE COUNTED THEM AS THEY FELL
THAT LEFT THE WAY CLEAR TO THE DOOR
IT'S KEPT GOING ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE EARTH WILL SET DOWN HER SHIPS
THERE'S SOME CANNED SOUP--I TOOK THE MONEY FROM YOUR POCKET
THE NEW BEAT HAD GIVEN HIM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY
GOING HUNTING FOR THOSE DAMNED KIDS EH HE SAID
LET THEM OPEN THEIR BANKS--OUR BANKS--AGAIN
AS THE POLICE SWUNG AROUND ONE OF THE THUGS CASUALLY RIPPED THE AIRSUIT OPEN
MY ROOM IS MORE COMFORTABLE--AND PRIVATE INSIDE SHEILA SAT WOODENLY ON THE LITTLE SOFA PRETENDING TO SEE NONE OF THEM
THEN SHE SLUMPED BACK AND LAY QUIET AS HE UNFASTENED HER LEGS
THIS ONE HAD SEATS
SOMETHING COLD AND DAMP AGAINST HIS FOREHEAD BROUGHT GORDON PART WAY OUT OF HIS UNCONSCIOUSNESS FINALLY
SOMETHING TO DISCUSS--A PROPOSITION GORDON STOOD UP WOBBLING A LITTLE TRYING TO THINK
UPSTAIRS PLEASE SHE WHISPERED BESIDE PAPPA
GORDON SHRUGGED AND SHOVED IT INTO THE SLOT
THE LOCUST STICK LEFT GORDON'S HAND WITH A SNAP
DAMN IT WE SENT YOU HERE TO GET RESULTS AND YOU GOT THEM
HOSPITALS
HE DISCUSSED IT WITH MOTHER COREY WHO AGREED THAT WAYNE WOULD BE RE-ELECTED
I PUT IT UP IN YOUR ROOM MOTHER COREY CHUCKLED
AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF'S AMMUNITION HE SHIVERED STARING AT THE FORTUNE IN HIS HANDS
THE KID--RUSTY'S FRIEND--WROTE DOWN WHAT THEY DID TO HIM GORDON GRUNTED
THAT DAMNED COP BEFORE US
THAT'S ALL BRUCE GORDON WENT OUT HOLDING THE ENVELOPE
FOR A SECOND CONSTERNATION SEEMED TO REIGN
PRAEGER SEEMED TO READ HIS MIND

THE LAST TIME EVERY CAR WAS LOOTED IN OUTER MARSPORT
THE THICK VOICE MUST BELONG TO THE BIG APE WHO'D BEEN WITH HIM
HE'D RECOGNIZED HIM FINALLY AS SCHULBERG THE LITTLE GROCER FROM THE NINETEENTH PRECINCT
TRENCH MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER TENSION TOO
GIVE ME THAT DAMNED SWITCH HE GRABBED FOR IT BUT GORDON HELD FIRMLY TO THE COPPER STRAP
BRUCE GORDON LIFTED THE CRADLED PHONE FROM THE BOX
HIS HANDS CAUGHT THE MAN BEHIND LIFTED ACROSS A HIP AND HEAVED JUST BEFORE THE FRONT MAN REACHED HIM
ANY MAN COMES NEAR IT IT'LL BLOW
THEN HIS EYES CAUGHT THE BRIGHT CHALK MARKS AROUND IT--NOTICES TO THE GANGS TO KEEP HANDS OFF
I WON'T NEED THEM OUT THERE SHE SAID
IN A MINUTE THE CITIZENS GROUP WAS INSIDE RIPPING THE FIXED BALLOTS TO SHREDS FILLING OUT AND DROPPING THEIR OWN
GORDON HESITATED THEN SWUNG GLUMLY TOWARD A CORNER WHERE HE COULD FIND A POLICE CALL BOX
IN ONE HOUR
HE HAD NO CLEAR IDEA OF HOW THE BATTLES WERE GOING BUT IT LOOKED AS IF THE SEVENTH PRECINCT WAS STILL IN MUNICIPAL HANDS
KID CAN'T TALK
HE HAD NO BOOK NO CLUES AS TO WHOM TO SEE AND WHAT TO DO
MURDOCH NODDED
IT'S THE ONLY KEY THERE IS CHAPTER XI THE SKY'S THE LIMIT ALL THAT DAY THE THREE ROCKET SHIPS SAT OUT ON THE FIELD
SHEILA SHOT THE BEAM OF HER LIGHT ON THE THIN DRAWN FACE
SOME OF THE MOTHER'S OLD LODGERS FROM THE RUIN OUTSIDE THE DOME WERE INSIDE NOW--OBVIOUSLY POSTED WHERE IT WOULD DO THE MOST GOOD
THEN HIS EYES NARROWED AND A STIFF SMILE CAME ONTO HIS LIPS AS HE LAID THE PEN DOWN
HE WAS A SICK-LOOKING SPECTACLE
THOUGH I OUGHT TO LET YOU STAY OUT THERE AND ROT
I'VE GOT THE MAN WHO HELD YOU UP HOSPITAL HER VOICE BROKE INTO ANOTHER WAIL
HE CHECKED AGAIN TO SEE THAT THE WIRE WAS TIGHT AND THEN PICKED UP THE TWO HENCHMEN WHO WERE SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF REVIVING
FROM SOMEWHERE HE DUG UP A SUIT OF CLOTHES THAT MURDOCH COULD WEAR
YOU SHEILA YOU COME OUTA THERE
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU DON'T HAVE INCOME TAX HERE WE DO TRENCH SAID FLATLY
SHEILA AND TRENCH TOGETHER--AND THE SECURITY BADGE WAS STILL IN HIS POUCH
AHEAD MOTHER COREY'S REARED UP--A HUGE UGLY HALF-CYLINDER OF PITTED METAL AND NATIVE BRICKS SHOWING THE PATCHWORK OF DECADES BEFORE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ABANDONED
ALL KINDS OF SUPPLIES WERE LOW AND THE OUTLANDS BEYOND MARSPORT HAD CUT OFF ALL SHIPMENTS
THEY NEARED THE BAR WHERE SHEILA WAS WORKING AND BRUCE GORDON SWORE
AND MEN BEGAN PILING OUT ALL IN SHINY GREEN
FROM ONE OF THEM A MACHINE GUN OPENED FIRE
THE MESS HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEANED UP WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE CHEAPER END OF THE BEAT
I FAILED THE POOR MAN WHO DIED--AND NOW I HAVE FAILED YOU
GORDON REACHED FOR THE GAG BUT THE OTHER HELD UP HIS HANDS AND POINTED TO THE GUN
THE KID'S OPEN TORCH STUCK ON HIS HELMET GAVE THEM LIGHT ENOUGH UNTIL GORDON COULD SWITCH ON HIS OWN
I'M BLOODY WELL SUCKERED SO FORGET IT GORDON SHRUGGED AND GAVE UP
ANOTHER SUSPICIOUS-EYED MAN STUDIED HIM
THERE WAS NO SHUFFLE TO MOTHER COREY NOW
IZZY HAD DUCKED AROUND THE SIDE AND NOW CAME BACK LEADING THE LITTLE MAN
SHE'S HAD BAD LUCK WITH MEN SHE ALREADY KNOWS THE SECURITY MAN SAID
YES YOU ARE
WHAT'S YOUR PRECINCT ELEVENTH BUT I'M NOT VOTING
BUT THE WARNING HAD SOMEHOW BEEN GIVEN AND BOTH FORCES WERE READY
I DON'T GET IT
LET'S KEEP IT END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF POLICE YOUR PLANET BY LESTER DEL REY
PUT A UNIFORM ON SOME MEN AND THEY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEY'RE COPS EH COBBER HE SHOVED UP FROM THE TABLE ABRUPTLY AND HEADED FOR HIS ROOM SWEARING TO HIMSELF
THEY HAD TROUBLES WITH THEIR GOVERNMENTS TOO--AND THEY HAD PANICS
IT IS A BAD DAY FOR ME YOUNG MAN
RUSTY WAS BUSY OPENING HIS BAR AND THE OTHERS WERE ALL BUSY
I'LL WORK IT OUT SOMEHOW THE BEAT WAS A GOLD MINE
IT'S A HELLUVA ROUNDABOUT WAY OF DOING THINGS GOV'NOR BUT IF THE GEES PAY FOR PROTECTION ANY OLD WAY THEN THEY'RE GONNA GET IT THEY GOT IT
AND FOR A WHILE THINGS WILL IMPROVE
NOT A DAMNED THING IF I CAN HELP IT
NO I DON'T MEAN HIM
BUT AFTER SUPPER HE WENT TO IZZY'S ROOM TO ARRANGE FOR A RAID ON MUNICIPAL TERRITORY
THEY LIVE IN A HALF-WORLD AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE ON THE CRUMBS THE DOME TOSSES THEM
SAVE TIME BOYS HE SAID GENIALLY
HE THREW THE LIGHT TO GORDON AND STOOPED TO RUN EXPERT HANDS OVER THE CORPSE AND THROUGH THE POCKETS
IN NO TIME MEN IN CRUDE MASKS WERE CLEARING OUT THE BOOTH DRIVING THE LAST STRUGGLING CITIZENS AWAY AND GETTING READY FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL
THE YAMMERING STOPPED FINALLY AND IZZY STUCK HIS HEAD AND ONE ARM OUT WITH A SNAP OF HIS KNIFE
BETWEEN HIS SPREAD KNEES LAY MURDOCH BOUND AND GAGGED HIS FACE A BLOODY MESS
VACATION MOTHER COREY ASKED
THEN THERE WAS THE BITING STING OF ANTISEPTIC SHARP ENOUGH TO BRING A GROAN FROM HIS LIPS
SCRIP WAS USELESS TO THEM AND THE LEGALS WERE RAIDING ALL CARGOES DESTINED FOR WAYNE'S SECTION
LINE THEM UP WHEN THE HOODS CAME TO THEY FOUND THEMSELVES HELPLESS AND FACING POLICE WITH CLUBS
I WAS KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT YOU GORDON BUT YOU GOT A NICE TOUCH
FINALLY THEY ROLLED INTO CITY HALL DOWN A RAMP AND ONTO AN ELEVATOR THAT TOOK THEM THREE LEVELS DOWN
A BLUISH HOLE APPEARED ON THE MAN'S FOREHEAD
A LONG TIME HE RUBBED A PASTY HAND OVER HIS CHIN SHAKING HIS HEAD AND WHEEZING HEAVILY
THE TRUCK FALTERED AS IT HIT THE NEARLY FINISHED OBSTACLE AND GORDON FELT HIS STOMACH SQUASHING DOWN ONTO THE WHEEL
HE HEARD THE MAN HIT THE BASEMENT EVEN WHILE HE WAS SWINGING THE CLUB IN HIS HAND TOWARD THE RAT-FACED MAN
HOODLUMS BEGAN MOVING ELSEWHERE TOWARD EASIER PICKINGS
HE FINALLY MADE THE STAIRS AND REACHED HIS BED BEFORE HE PASSED OUT
THE WOMAN SEEMED TO READ HIS FACE
HELL'S POPPING HERE--YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE
THE CROUPIER SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT THEN CAUGHT THE WHEEL AND SPUN IT SAVAGELY
HEY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT THOUGH--A REAL CONSIDERATE MAN
A GOOD NUMBER OF THE MEN IN THE LINE WERE WITH THE ATTACKERS
SLEEP ON THE FLOOR WANT A BUNK SQUAT WITH FOUR OR ROOM AND DUCHESS TO YOURSELF THERE WAS A PERIOD OF HAGGLING FOLLOWED BY A WAIT AS MOTHER COREY KICKED FOUR GRUMBLING MEN OUT OF A FOUR-BY-SEVEN HOLE ON THE SECOND FLOOR
BUT GORDON HAD SPOTTED THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE GRAY CAR
THEY'RE CHANGING OVER TO ELECTRIC EYES
HE HEARD A TINY PATROL CAR TURN THE CORNER AND DUCKED BACK INTO ANOTHER ALLEY TO WAIT FOR IT TO GO BY
WITH MY OWN HANDS I CARRIED HIM HERE GORDON FELT SICK
WE CAN'T KNOW IN OUR LIFETIME
COME ON OUT THE LITTLE MAN CRIED AGAIN
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RUN THE WIRE IN IZZY SAID DOUBTFULLY
BIGGER BITS FOR TWO YEARS ALSO WASTED IN TRYING HIS HAND AT PROFESSIONAL GAMBLING
HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD HIS AND THE SCISSORS AND BANDAGES ON HER LAP HIT THE FLOOR AS SHE JUMPED TO HER FEET
THEN SHE GASPED
GORDON STARTED TO STEP IN THEN BUT THERE WAS NO TIME
MOST OF THE SHOPS WERE ALREADY CLOSED--EVEN SOME OF THE SALOONS
BUT RANDOLPH WALKED WITH A LIMP FROM THE LAST WORKING OVER HE HAD RECEIVED
THEN HE TURNED BACK BUT SHE HAD VANISHED INTO ONE OF THE ROOMS
WHEN A MAN GETS OLD HE LIKES A LITTLE COMFORT COBBER
WE CAN SURE USE THAT AMMUNITION YOU FOUND
WHERE IS IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
WHERE IS IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
COREY TAPPED HER SHOULDER POINTING OUT THE ROUT AND SHE GUNNED THE CAR
MOTHER COREY LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
ED
I'VE BEEN PAYING FIFTY BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY GORDON NODDED AND SWUNG ON HIS HEEL SURPRISED TO FIND THAT HIS STOMACH WAS TURNING
I FIGURE YOU KNOW WHERE ALL THE SCRATCH WENT SURE--GUNS FROM EARTH
THEN HIS GRIN WIPED OUT AS THE KID'S ARM FLASHED TO HIS SHOULDER AND BACK A SERIES OF QUICK JERKS THAT SEEMED ALMOST A BLUR
THE LINE WAITING TO VOTE BROKE UP BUT THE CITIZENS HAD APPARENTLY ORGANIZED WITH CARE
ALL WE CAN DO IS TO HOPE
MOST OF THE STREET LIGHTS HAD NEVER BEEN INSTALLED--GRAFT HAD EATEN UP THE APPROPRIATIONS INSTEAD--AND THE NEAREST ONE WAS AROUND THE CORNER LEAVING THE SIDE OF FATS PLACE IN THE SHADOW
IT'S UP TO THEM TO TAKE IT OR LOSE IT SO I GET SENT TO MERCURY YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
GORDON LEAPED IN TO SEE A MUNICIPAL DROPPING THE MACHINE GUN
THAT TIME I GAVE YOU THE NOTE YOU DIDN'T COME WHEN I SAID AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
PRISONER HE ANNOUNCED CRISPLY TO THE GUARD BUT THERE WAS NO PROTEST THIS TIME
YOU GUYS IN MARSPORT FEED YOURSELVES SO MANY LIES YOU BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEM
AND AFTER I SAVED YOUR MISERABLE LIFE THANKS FOR THAT HE GRUNTED
DID YOU CALL ME OUT OF BED JUST TO CHECK ON THAT YOUNG MAN NO I THEN HE HUNG UP
I'M TURNING IN RIGHT NOW MOTHER COREY SHOOK HIS HEAD SHAKING THE FEW HAIRS ON HIS HEAD AND FACE AND THE WRINKLES IN HIS DOUGHY SKIN DEEPENED
THE TROUBLE THOUGH WAS THAT ISAIAH TRENCH WAS NEITHER SLOW NOR SQUEAMISH
THE FORCE PAYS FOR MY TIME DURING THE DAY AND I FIGURE MY TIME'S MY OWN AT NIGHT
SOME OF THE YOUNGER CHILDREN WERE RUNNING AROUND WITHOUT HELMETS CONFIRMING PRAEGER'S CLAIM THAT THIRD-GENERATION MARTIANS SOMEHOW LEARNED TO ADAPT TO THE ATMOSPHERE
GORDON DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE TOO WELCOME THERE
IT'S YOUR ROOM COBBER THE OLD MAN WHEEZED
AND THE PEOPLE ROSE UP AND DEMANDED THEIR RIGHT TO RULE THEMSELVES
NO WAY OF TELLING HOW BIG BUT IT'S COMING IT GAVE GORDON SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHILE THEY PATROLLED THE BEAT
GET US BACK IZZY HE ORDERED
THEN THE CAPTAIN TURNED AND STUCK OUT HIS HAND
AT THE GATE OF THE DOME HE LOOKED BACK AGAIN THEN DUCKED INTO THE LOCKER BUILDING
TRENCH CLIMBED OUT AND NODDED IN SATISFACTION
THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLANTERS AT ONCE STRIKING WITHOUT SCIENCE BUT WITH FEROCITY
SAYS HE WANTS TO SEE YOU
SECURITY MIGHT THINK IT WAS ENOUGH FOR THE MOMENT AND THE LOCAL MEN MIGHT POSSIBLY DECIDE IT A MERE REQUIRED FORMALITY
THERE TO YOUR LEFT THE NAME WAS VAGUELY FAMILIAR AS ONE OF THE SORE SPOTS OF MARSPORT
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FIFTY OF THEM
HER VOICE WAS THICK MUFFLED IN THE BLANKET
MOST OF THE BARRICADES WERE DOWN
HIS FINAL SIGHT WAS THAT OF THE LEGALS AND MUNICIPALS WILDLY SCRAMBLING FOR COVER FROM EACH OTHER
HE CAUGHT HER SHOULDERS AND SHOVED HER BACK PULLING THE WEAPONS FROM HER
OR IS IT MAYBE THAT SOMEBODY ISN'T BEING EXACTLY HONEST WITH THE SCRATCH THEY LIFT FROM THE GEES WE STILL HAVE TO EAT GORDON SAID BITTERLY
THE GAG HAD JUST COME OUT WHEN THE STAR POINT MAN JUMPED INTO VIEW AGAIN WAVING A RAG OVER HIS HEAD AND YELLING
BUT THEY FOUND NO GUARD
WE GOTTA BE NEUTRAL BOYS HE BOOMED
HE WONDERED HOW THEY'D GO ABOUT CONTACTING THE COMMISSIONER
A SHEET OF PAPER IN NORMAL WRITING FELL OUT
IZZY'S POCK-MARKED FACE SOURED FOR A SECOND AS HE STARED AT GORDON
BRUCE GORDON CAME TO HIS FEET AND STARTED FOR HER
NOW YOU COME CRAWLING BACK TO YOUR ONLY FRIEND ISAACS
BUT TRENCH AIN'T MARRIED AND I GUESS I'VE USED UP THE TOUCH
THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH LIGHT TO MAKE OUT FAINT OUTLINES AND GORDON BROUGHT HIS LOCUST CLUB DOWN TWICE WITH THE HOLLOW THUD OF WOOD ON SKULLS
AND IT'S A GOOD THING I'VE ALWAYS KEPT MYSELF A PLACE UNDER A SAFE INCOGNITO OUT IN THE STICKS
THANKS FROM THE MAYOR
RIGHT NOW I CAN APPRECIATE FRIENDS
IT WAS A RICH TERRITORY AND REQUIRED CAREFUL MINING
MARTIANS
AFTER THE COPS HAD DUMPED THE UNCONSCIOUS KID INTO THE BACK OF THE SMALL SQUAD CAR AND GONE LOOKING FOR MORE GAME GORDON WENT OVER TO LOOK AT THE TATTERED SCRAPS LEFT OF THE OPPOSITION PAPER
YOU ME HE AGREED
BUT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE SIMPLE ENOUGH
SURE REPORT AT ONCE
A LOT OF MEN GOT THAT TREATMENT
HE CAME TO HIS FEET AND LEAPED AFTER HER
SHEILA LAY STRETCHED OUT ON THE FLOOR WHERE HER HEAD HAD APPARENTLY STRUCK AGAINST THE LEG OF A BED
THE TWO OF YOU SIMPLY FILL OUT A FORM--I'VE GOT A FEW LEFT FROM THE LAST TIME--AND GET IZZY AND ME TO WITNESS IT
SHE WAS MAKING NO SOUND AND THERE WAS NO RESISTANCE BUT THE TEARS RAN OUT ONE DROP SEEMING TO TRIP OVER ANOTHER
DARKNESS FELL SHARPLY AS IT ALWAYS DID IN MARS THIN AIR BUT THEY WENT ON HEADING OUT INTO THE DUNES OF THE DESERT
BUT YOU'RE STILL A GOOD COP THEY RODE ON FURTHER IN SILENCE UNTIL GORDON BROKE THE ICE TO EASE THE TENSION
THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH PEOPLE WATCHING WITH A NUMBED HUNGER FOR ANY KIND OF EXCITEMENT
GOV'NOR WE'RE ABOUT DUE TO REPORT IN GORDON NODDED
DRINK IT ALL COBBER
THEN SUDDENLY SHE WAS A WRITHING BITING SCRATCHING FURY
BUT IT WAS SHEILA WHO CAUGHT THE FAINT SOUND
SO SECURITY WANTS ME TO CONTACT THE OTHERS IN THE BOOK AND ORGANIZE THINGS YES MURDOCH SWALLOWED
DAMNED FOOL HE MUTTERED
BRUCE GORDON FELT HIS NERVES CREEPING OUT OF HIS SKIN AND BEGINNING TO STAND ON END TO TEST EACH BREEZE FOR DANGER
HE FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN UP THE STAIRS
IT SEATED ON A PLASTIC SEAL AND THE LITTLE AIR COMPRESSOR AT HIS BACK BEGAN TO HUM READY TO TURN THE THIN WISP OF MARS ATMOSPHERE INTO A BARELY BREATHABLE PRESSURE
BUT WHILE THE IMMEDIATE PRESSURE OF STARVATION WAS LIFTED GORDON'S OWN STOMACH TOLD HIM THAT IT WASN'T AN ADEQUATE DIET
CLAIMED HE WAS HEAD OF IT HERE AND WANTED ME TO SEND A MESSAGE TO EARTH FOR HIM TRENCH NODDED A TOUCH OF RELIEF ON HIS FACE
HE SLAPPED IT DOWN ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THEM
ALL I GOT FOR A GUIDE WAS AN OLD BUM
HE LOCATED HER HELMET AND CARRIED IT DOWN WITH HIM
THERE WAS A FAINT TOUCH OF HUMOR IN HER VOICE THEN
ARE YOU SATISFIED NOW YOU MECHANICAL BEAST
SET TO CLEAN UP--AND I DID FOR A WHILE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND HANDED THE DECK BACK TO GORDON
THEN A MARSPEAKER-AMPLIFIED VOICE SHOUTED FROM IT
GORDON STUCK IT INTO HIS POUCH AND FOLLOWED THE THREE
WHO IS IT A MAN IN DISTRESS HE YELLED BACK
BUT I WISH YOU'D TELL MY WIFE SOMETIME THAT--WELL THAT I DIDN'T JUST RUN OUT ON HER
AND BROTHER DO YOU NEED IT IF YOU'RE COUNTING ON THOSE MUGS
MOTHER COREY LET THEM IN WITHOUT FLICKERING AN EYELASH AS HE SAW HIS GRANDDAUGHTER
THE ANGER AND HYSTERIA WERE GIVING WAY TO A SULLEN BEATEN HOPELESSNESS
HE'D BEEN RIGHT--THIS WAS O'NEILL HEAD OF THE STONEWALL GANG
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE EYES OF THE GIRL AND A SNIFFLING SOUND REACHED HIM THROUGH HER MARSPEAKER
FATS HAD SWUNG BACK AND WAS NOW HERDING THE CROWD INSIDE HIS PLACE
BUT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND GROWN
YOU'RE RIGHT GOV'NOR
THE ENTRANCE SEAL OPENED BRIEFLY
ROUGH EH
HE WAS VAGUELY CONSCIOUS LATER OF LOOKING UP TO SEE SHEILA DRAGGING HIM INTO SOME ENTRANCE WHILE TRENCH RAN TOWARD THEM
HIS EYES DARTED UP AND MET THOSE OF THE BLONDE VIXEN
BUT THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR HIM
GORDON WAS FIRING RAPIDLY BUT NOT WITH SUCH A STUPID ATTEMPT AT SPEED THAT HE COULDN'T AIM EACH SHOT
HE GOT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WAYNE HAD WON A THUMPING VICTORY BETTER THAN THREE TO TWO
IT BOTHERED HIM
THE STREET WAS ALREADY BRISTLING WITH BARRICADES AROUND THE ENTRANCES AND EVERYTHING RAN WITH A LAST DESPERATE RESTLESSNESS AS IF THERE WOULD BE NO TOMORROW
GORDON FILLED HIS OUT WITH A FIGURE A BIT HIGHER THAN HALF OF GABLE'S TAKE AND DROPPED IT IN THE BOX
GORDON SWUNG WHERE THEIR EYES POINTED UNTIL HE SAW FATS ELLER SIDLING THROUGH THE GROUPS THEN LET THE KNIFE SLIP INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND AS THE CROWD SEEMED TO HOLD ITS BREATH
A WOMAN STOOD THERE MOANING OVER A PALE MAN ON THE FLOOR
THE MOTHER'S THE ONLY MAN EVERYBODY KNOWS I GUESS--AND HIS WORD HAS NEVER BEEN BROKEN THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER
SOME OF THE CITIZENS LOOKED UP AND YELLED BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
COBBER I ALREADY OWN A JOINT THERE--A NICE ONE THEY TELL ME
IZZY LED THE WAY TO THE ONE AT THE RICH END OF THEIR BEAT AND MOVED TOWARD THE HEAD OF THE LINE
THEY WERE GROUPED AROUND THE BOOTHS AND THEY HAD BEGUN TO LINE UP THEIR MEN PUTTING THEM IN POSITION TO BEGIN VOTING AT ONCE
EVEN IZZY ADMITTED FINALLY THAT THEY'D HAVE TO WAIT
EVEN AS THE WEEK HAD GONE HE STILL HAD MORE MONEY IN HIS WALLET THAN HE HAD EXPECTED
BRASSY YELLOW HAIR SPILLED OVER A GIRL'S FACE AND HER BREATH SLAMMED OUT OF HER THROAT AS SHE HIT
HE'D TRIED TO PLAY HONEST CARDS
THAT'S IT
YOU'RE NOT ASSIGNED HERE ANY MORE
WITH A LITTLE WORK THE PLACE COULD BE CLEANED ENOUGH
COME ON YOU GEES
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE VIXEN'S ROOM IT'S WHERE YOU BUNKED BEFORE
I NEVER SAW IT
BRUCE GORDON PULLED MURDOCH ASIDE
HIS HEEL LASHED BACK AND CAUGHT THE SHIN OF THE MAN BEHIND HIM
WE ADMIT THERE HAVE BEEN ABUSES
THEY BEGAN IN THE POORER SECTION
AND STRICTLY ON THE LEVEL COBBER
THEY THEN EXCHANGED LOOKS AND SHOOK THEIR HEADS
SUDDENLY A WHISPER OF SOUND CAUGHT HIS EARS
WHO CARES
EVEN HE'S SHOCKED
THE JOINTS HAD BEEN BETTER BARRICADED AND THE LOOTING HAD BEEN KEPT TO A MINIMUM
THEN I HEARD THE RUMPUS
NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT A WIFE TO SUPPORT YOU'LL SUPPORT HER
AND IT HAD TO BE DONE SO THAT NO REPAIR COULD EVER BE MADE
YEAH WE DO
IZZY CAME BACK FROM A CAREFUL EXPLORATION
SCHULBERG SHRUGGED
WE THOUGHT YOU'D GONE ON THE LAM COBBER
THERE WERE TRUCKS COMING OUT OF THE PLASTICS PLANT AND MOBSTERS WERE GATHERING UP THEIR DRUNKS AND CHASING THE CITIZENS BACK INTO THEIR HOUSES
HORROR SHOT OVER THE OTHER'S BRUISED FEATURES
I LOST CONNECTION YEARS AGO GORDON
THEN THE WORDS OF THE THIN MAN BELOW REACHED HIM
THERE WAS NO USE TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO IZZY
MOTHER COREY WAS APPARENTLY MAKING GOOD ON HIS PROMISE TO TAKE A BATH
HE MUST HAVE BEEN TO SPIN THAT STORY
HE COULD STAY HERE FIGHTING WITH HER OR HE COULD FACE HIS TROUBLES ON THE OUTSIDE
MUST BE A BLOODY BIG FALSE SECTION YOU'VE GOT IN THAT TRICK MATTRESS OF YOURS BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM AND FOR TRENCH IZZY MOTHER COREY'S WHEEZING VOICE AGREED
SUDDENLY A SIREN BLASTED OUT IN SHARP BURSTS AND THE LIEUTENANT JUMPED
SHE CAUGHT HIS STARE AND REDDENED SLOWLY
THE SOLAR SECURITY OFFICE HAD GIVEN HIM THE KNIFE PRACTICE TO MAKE SURE HE COULD USE IT JUST AS THEY'D MADE SURE HE HADN'T TAKEN EXTRA MONEY WITH HIM BEYOND THE REGULATION AMOUNT
THEN HE WAS RUNNING FRANTICALLY FORWARD
MEN WOMEN GORDON ANSWERED
THIS TIME HE STRIPPED HIMSELF TO THAT SUM AT ONCE DEPOSITING THE REST IN THE FIRST MARSPORT BANK
GIVE EM HELL GOV'NOR THE KID'S VOICE YELLED AND THE LITTLE FIGURE WAS BESIDE HIM A SHOWER OF BLADES SEEMING TO LEAP FROM HIS HAND IN THE GLARE OF HIS BARE TORCH
THEY HADN'T ARRIVED WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE HE SAID TRUTHFULLY ENOUGH
TRENT LEAPED FROM THE TRUCK MOTIONING THEM TO FOLLOW AND THEY BEGAN LOADING THE CRATES HASTILY
IN THE NINTH PRECINCT THE PLANTERS WERE THE BIGGEST GANG AND ALL THE OTHERS WERE TEMPORARILY ENROLLED UNDER THEM
HERE HE DREW A SMALL GOLDEN BAND FROM HIS LITTLE FINGER
YOU BOUGHT A PUNCHED MEAL TICKET
I GOT AROUND AFTER I SPOTTED YOU HERE SHEILA COREY FORCED HERSELF TO A SITTING POSITION AND SPAT AT IZZY
YOU DON'T
THEN HE SAW THAT THE OBJECT OF IT ALL WAS THE FIRST MARSPORT BANK
THIN KIDS WITH BIG EYES AND SULLEN MOUTHS CROWDED THE STREETS IN THEIR AIRSUITS YELLING PROFANITY
THE DRIVER SWORE AT THE LASH OF SOUND AND GRABBED FOR THE AIRLOCK SWITCH
HE WENT INTO THE MEETING WILLING TO AGREE TO ANYTHING
CAN'T DO A THING NOW
A SINGLE FLIP OF HIS LOCUST CLUB AGAINST THEIR WRISTS ACCOUNTED FOR BOTH OF THE KNIVES
THERE WAS A LITTLE ILLUMINATION FROM THE PHOSPHORESCENT MARKERS AT SOME OF THE CORNERS AND FROM THE STARS
THEN HE SWORE AND HEADED FOR HIS ROOM
IT'S MERCURY BRUCE GORDON NODDED SLOWLY
BUT IT'S GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE WORK I'M DOING ON THE MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN FOR RE-ELECTION
FANATICS CRUSADERS AND DAMNED FOOLS HE SAID
HE MADE NO COMMENT BUT DUTIFULLY FILLED OUT THE PROPER PORTION OF BOTH TAKES FOR THE VOLUNTARY DONATION BOX
HERE HE COULDN'T HEAR FOOTSTEPS
ALL RIGHT GORDON SAID WHAT GOES ON THE OTHER BEGAN EXPLAINING AS HE PICKED A WAY THROUGH THE RUIN AND RUBBLE
BEEN HERE DOZENS OF TIMES MYSELF
A BLUDGEON WAS SUDDENLY HURTLING TOWARD HIM AND HE DUCKED IT HIS BLOOD THICK IN HIS THROAT AND HIS EARS RINGING WITH THE SAME PRESSURE OF FEAR HE'D ALWAYS KNOWN JUST BEFORE HE WAS KAYOED IN THE RING
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUNCTURE MY SEAL
THE MUNICIPALS BROKE
INSTEAD THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO RESENT THE LOSS OF THE FAMILIAR SYMBOL OF HATRED
TRENCH WAS ARGUING FRANTICALLY WITH THE POMPOUS FIGURE OF CAPTAIN HENDRIX
THE DOME IS MINED BY GORDON'S SIDE A SUDDEN GARGLING SOUND CAME FROM THE KID
TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL HE SAW IZZY AND SHEILA LEAVE WONDERING VAGUELY WHERE SHE HAD BEEN
DROP IT IN THE MAIL AND YOU'RE MARRIED IF YOU THINK I'D MARRY YOU YOU FILTHY SHEILA BEGAN
SOME OF THEM WERE WEARING THE FORBIDDEN GUNS BUT IT WOULDN'T MATTER ON A DAY WHEN NO POLICE WERE ON DUTY
HE HADN'T BEEN WATCHING AS CLOSELY AS HE SHOULD
I'M DECLARING MYSELF IN HE TOLD THEM COLDLY
BEHAVE YOURSELF HE WARNED HER AS HE TOOK OFF HIS HELMET AND THEN UNFASTENED HERS
BUT NOW THE NORMAL NOISE WAS DIFFERENT
I WENT BACK ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
THEN HE SWUNG JUST AS MURDOCH MADE IT
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL POPULATION OF MARS IS--DECENT PEOPLE MEN WHO ARE GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A REAL PLANET SOME DAY THERE ARE PLENTY LIKE THAT HERE TOO RANDOLPH SAID
THERE WERE ANGLES OR THE PRICE OF A CORPORALCY WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER
HE HANDED OVER A KEY AND NODDED TOWARD THE FIRST SERVICE ENGINE
IF EARTH SHOULD WIN--AND THEY HAD MOST OF THE POWER AFTER ALL--AND BRUCE GORDON HAD FOUGHT AGAINST SECURITY THE MINES OF MERCURY WERE WAITING
THE CAPTAIN HAD TOLD HIM THE SAME
WE'RE ASSESSING YOU NOT LONG ON MARS ARE YOU MOTHER COREY ASKED
TWO BURLY GOONS WERE SUDDENLY WORKING TOGETHER
THE OLD HALL WAS IN WORSE SHAPE THAN BEFORE
THERE WAS THE BEGINNING OF A PITCHED BATTLE RIGHT AT THE SPOT WHERE GORDON NEEDED HIS OWN COVER
HE FOUND A COUPLE OF ROCKS AND A BOTTLE AND LET THEM FLY THEN BENT FOR MORE
HE DROPPED SLOWLY
HE TESTED THE MARSPEAKER--AN AMPLIFIER AND SPEAKER IN ANOTHER POUCH DESIGNED TO RAISE THE VOLUME OF HIS VOICE TO A LEVEL WHERE IT WOULD CARRY THROUGH EVEN THE AIR OF MARS
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU SERGEANT GORDON HE SWUNG OUT OF VIEW ABRUPTLY LEAVING GORDON WITH A HEAVY WEIGHT IN HIS STOMACH
MOTHER COREY NODDED INSTANT UNDERSTANDING RUNNING OVER HIS PUTTYLIKE FACE
JUST REMEMBER HE GOT US OUR JOBS
IT'S YOUR LIFE BUSTER HE SAID AND REACHED FOR THE BRAKE
SPECIAL PASS TO LEAVE AT THIS HOUR THE GUARD THERE REMINDED HIM
THEN THEY WENT CRASHING DOWN AND GORDON WAS OVER THEM
COME ON OUTSIDE GORDON SAW OTHER COPS MOVING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AND HE REALIZED THAT MURDOCH MUST BE SENDING OUT WARNINGS TO THE CITIZENS THAT THINGS WOULD SOON BE ROUGH AGAIN
BRUCE GORDON WAS THROUGH IT AND INTO THE NIGHT IN TWO SOARING LEAPS
HE'D PLAYED IT SAFE THIS TIME--HE'D PUT HIS MONEY AWAY TO MAKE SURE HE'D HAVE IT
HE MADE SURE HIS KNIFE WAS IN ITS SHEATH AND THAT THE GUN AT HIS SIDE WAS LOADED
KEEP GOING MURDOCH ORDERED
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS
COMING DOWN THE STREET WITH NO REGARD FOR MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY THE TRUCKS OF THE CROOPSTERS WERE BATTERING ASIDE THE FEW WHO COULD NOT REACH SAFETY
TEMPORARY BUILDINGS HAD BEEN THROWN UP AND THEN HAD REMAINED DECAYING INTO DEATHTRAPS
SPECIAL MEETING TOMORROW
SHE STUDIED IT UNDER THE GLARE OF THE SINGLE BULB AND THEN TURNED TO HER ROOM
MAKING TROUBLE FOR JURGENS--COULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED AS FALSE ARREST
THAT'S WHY I WASH MY HANDS OF HER
THE CLUB ROLLED TOWARD GORDON WHO CAUGHT IT BEFORE IT COULD REACH THE FLOOR
GORDON GOT DOWN FOLLOWED BY SHEILA AS TRENCH TOOK THE WHEEL
GORDON SPOTTED THEM FIRST AND DREW THE OTHERS BACK
YEAH I GOT HIM
THERE WERE NO WINDOWS THOUGH ONCE THERE HAD BEEN
BUT THE ONLY SOUND HE MADE WAS A CHOKING GOBBLE
YOU'RE A FOOL HE TOLD HER BITTERLY
REPORT EXPECTED OVERDUE
AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE A PRIVATE BATH BUT IT BEATS THE CHICKEN COOP
I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD TONIGHT
SHEILA PROPPED THE FLIMSY PILLOW BEHIND HIM THEN WENT INTO HER ROOM TO COME BACK WITH A PLASTIC CUP FILLED WITH BROWN LIQUID THAT PASSED FOR COFFEE HERE
BRUCE GORDON GOT BOTH EYES OPEN AND MANAGED TO SIT UP
HI GORDON HE SAID
AND THE BUILDINGS HAD COME THROUGH THE OUTWARD EXPLOSION OF THE PRESSURE WITH LITTLE DAMAGE
THEN THE JEEPS HAD DRIVEN BACK TO THE ROCKETS GONE ON BOARD AND THE SHIPS HAD TAKEN OFF
WANT A GOOD ROOM GORDON'S LIPS TWITCHED
CHAPTER VIII VOTE EARLY AND OFTEN IZZY WAS UP FIRST THE NEXT MORNING URGING THEM TO HURRY BEFORE THINGS BEGAN TO HUM
I KNOW HIS EYES RESTED ON GORDON
AND THE BALL HOVERED OVER TWENTY-ONE AND CAME TO REST THERE ONCE MORE
HASN'T CHANGED THAT ONE
I'VE GOT SOME OVERTIME FOR YOU SINCE YOU NEED EXTRA MONEY
GET OUT OF MY WAY YOU DAMNED LEGAL MACHINE SHE SPAT
YOU GOT YOUR MEAL TICKET AND YOU'VE OUTGROWN IT IN THIS MESS
SHEILA'S HAIR FELL OVER HER FACE AS SHE BENT TO REPLACE HIS BANDAGES
CROOKED LITTLE TRAITOR SHUT UP SHEILA IZZY SAID
HELL'S GOING TO POP
PAPPA IS DEAD
SO YOU'RE THAT GORDON
GABLE HAD SOLD HIM THE LIST OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED AND HE USED IT THOUGH HE CUT DOWN THE FIGURES IN A FEW CASES
THE STONEWALL GANG--WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT--AND ALL ITS FRIENDS WOULD BE GUNNING FOR HIM NOW
BUT IT'S THE SAME OLD DEAL
HE PICKED UP THE SCATTERED MONEY AND HER KNIFE THEN MADE SURE SHE WAS STILL BREATHING
SHEILA WAS STILL ON HER KNEES FUMBLING WITH SOMETHING AND APPARENTLY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO HIM
INSIDE THE HALLWAY THE SECURITY MAN WHO'D FIRST SENT HIM TO MARS WAS WAITING
I WAS RAILROADED HERE BY SECURITY TOLD TO BE GOOD AND THEY'D LET ME GO HOME
UP THE NARROW LITTLE STREET WAS ROLLING A GROUP OF ABOUT SEVENTY MUNICIPAL POLICE AND HALF A DOZEN SMALL TRUCKS
IZZY ANSWERED BEFORE GORDON COULD RISE TO IT
HE'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE TONGUELESS KID
I SUPPOSE THAT WAS SOME DAMNED FOOL WHO TRIED TO GO BACK TO HIS BEAT THEN YOU'D BETTER LOOK AGAIN GORDON TOLD HIM
HE WAS ALREADY MOUNTING THE STAIRS
HE NODDED AND POINTED TO THE MAN'S BELT
OWEN MURTAGH MURTANG
FIFTY-FIFTY TURN IT IN TO MURDOCH GORDON SAID AND THEN CURSED HIMSELF
TOMORROW HE THOUGHT
THERE'S NO GRAFT OUT HERE HUH IZZY TURNED IT OVER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE NOLAN MAN THERE WAS A FOOL--NEITHER GREEN NOR AGREEABLE
THE OLD BOOK I GOT THE IDEA FROM DIDN'T MENTION THAT TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
AND NOW THE MEN INSIDE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE APPROACHING FORCE
YOU DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN OUR OLD FRIEND MURDOCH HE LED THEM TO ANOTHER ELEVATOR THEN SWUNG BACK TO THE TRUCK
AND SINCE THEY HAVE CHOSEN THE WEAPONS I DECLARE OUR LOYAL AND FUNCTIONING MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCE TO BE OUR ARMY
NAMES GORDON FOUND A SECTION AWAY FROM THE OTHERS
HERE'S THE WARRANT
THE OTHER SHOOK HIS HEAD
BUT ONCE THEY LEARNED HE WAS ALONE
YOU KILLED AND MAIMED WITH WORDS
YOU'VE GOT A PAD ON YOUR TAIL THE KID SAID AGAIN AS LOW AS HIS AMPLIFIER WOULD PERMIT
GORDON WAITED AROUND A WHILE LONGER BUT FINALLY HEADED BACK TO MOTHER COREY'S PLACE
GUN BUTTS ELBOWS FISTS AND CLUBS WERE POUNDING AT HIM WHILE HIS OWN CLUB LASHED OUT SAVAGELY
MARS WON'T GIVE UP--AND EARTH WANTS A PLUM NOT RESPONSIBILITY
IT WAS A NICE HAUL
IN A FEW MINUTES WAYNE'S SUPPORTERS WOULD HAVE THE BOOTH AGAIN
BUT FOUR OTHERS WERE LOUNGING IN THE BACKGROUND
THAT ENDED THAT AND I CAME OUT TO JOIN UP WITH YOU
HE WAVED BACK TOWARD THE CROWD
IN HER HAND WAS A PUNCHED TICKET WITH THE ORANGE OF MARS ON TOP AND THE BLACK OF MERCURY ON THE BOTTOM
DON'T BE CRAZY MISTER
TRENCH WAS REACHING FOR HIS REVOLVER BUT HE WAS GOING TO BE TOO LATE
AND STAY OUT FOR A MOMENT AS HE BEGAN POCKETING THE BILLS GORDON THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET AWAY THAT EASILY
THE DRUMMER WHO HAD WATCHED GORDON TEAR UP HIS YELLOW STUB MOVED FORWARD NOW
BUT NO WOMEN EXCEPT MARRIED ONES
BRUCE GORDON DROPPED HER ONTO HER LEGS
SHUT UP HE TOLD HER
MAYBE SECURITY'S GETTING SET TO SPRING THE IDEA OF MARSPORT REBELLING AGAINST EARTH SEEMED RIDICULOUS
HIS ARMY WAS GROWING
AND IT SHOULD GIVE HIM A FEW EXTRA SECONDS BEFORE HIS FORCES CRACKED
BUT THE EX-MARINE SMILED AS HE SAW BRUCE GORDON IN UNIFORM
I KNOW HIM
I WANT SOMEBODY SHOULD KNOW HOW IT WAS WITH US ONCE TOGETHER HE STAYED THEN PICKED THE TWO BODIES UP AND MOVED THEM FROM THE FLOOR ONTO THE BED WHERE HE HAD FIRST SEEN THE OLD MAN
HE WENT DOWN THE ROW VOTING REGULARLY
THE LEGALS HAD NEVER QUITE REACHED THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING OBVIOUSLY AND WERE NOW CUT INTO SECTIONS
YOU ALL SEE IT
GORDON MOVED FORWARD QUICKLY UNTIL HE COULD MAKE OUT THE THIN SCAR SHOWING THROUGH THE MAKE-UP OVER THE MAN'S EYES
THEN HE STOPPED AS THE CAPTAIN STOOD UP
WITH ALL THE SHOOTING SOME PUNK PUT A BULLET CLEAN THROUGH THE WALL AND THE PLASTIC OF THE TUB
AS THE DUNES DWINDLED BEHIND THEM GORDON COULD SEE THE BRIEF FLARE OF THE LITTLE ROCKET TAKING OFF
YOUR LEGS ARE STILL WHOLE
I WAS AFRAID SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT FIND IT HE CUT HER OFF BRUSQUELY HIS EYES RIVETED ON THE SECURITY BADGE HE'D BEEN SURE TRENCH HAD TAKEN
DON'T BEAT ME AGAIN GORDON'S STOMACH KNOTTED SICKLY
THE BOOK HE THOUGHT TRYING TO FOCUS HIS THOUGHTS
SHE'D ALREADY BEEN SHOPPING AND HAD INSTALLED THE TINY COOKING EQUIPMENT USED IN HALF MARSPORT
NOW HE GRINNED TIGHTLY AT GORDON AND BEGAN MOVING TOWARD HIM
HE MUST HAVE HAD HIS SUPPLY OF DRUGS LIFTED SOMEHOW
THEN IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE ELECTION
COREY'S HOUSE WAS ONE OF THE FEW THAT HAD KEPT SOME RELATION TO EARTH STYLES BY INSTALLING A COUPLE OF WINDOWS IN THE SECOND STORY AND IT WOULD GIVE A PERFECT VIEW OF THE STREET
GORDON TURNED THE RING OVER PUZZLED
AS HE DREW NEAR THOUGH TWO MEN EDGED ACROSS THE STREET FROM A CLUMP WATCHING THE BEGINNING EXCITEMENT
CRIPES
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU COBBER HE SAID AND THERE WAS ONLY AMUSEMENT IN HIS VOICE
AND THE FIRST GEE THAT GIVES TROUBLE TO THE MEN WHO PAY ME GETS A KNIFE WHERE HE EATS
AND THESE MARTIAN POISONS--THEY ARE SO SURE THEY DON'T HURT
TAKE IT AND ARREST WAYNE IT TOOK NEARLY AN HOUR TO GET THE PLANS SETTLED BUT FINALLY THEY HEADED FOR THE TRUCKS THAT HAD BEEN ARRIVING
I'M STILL NOT BOTHERING UNWILLING WOMEN--AND I'LL EVEN CLOSE MY EYES WHEN YOU DRESS SHE SIGHED AND RELAXED
OR WAYNE
GOD HE MOANED SOFTLY AND HIS EYES TURNED UP SLOWLY TO GORDON
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU NOW GORDON ASKED
HE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN SOFTLY BUT MADE NO EFFORT TO LOOK UP
ONLY NOW I'M RESPECTABLE MYSELF THEY DON'T LOOK SO GOOD
IT SEEMED TO BE IN ORDER
THEY DUCKED AROUND THE ELEVATOR UNSURE OF WHETHER IT COULD BE REMOTELY CONTROLLED AND UP A NARROW FLIGHT OF STAIRS DOWN A HALLWAY AND UP ANOTHER FLIGHT
SORRY
HE CAME BACK TO FIND HER CLEANING UP AND SHOVED HER AWAY
I HEARD YOU TOSSING AROUND I'M FINE HE TOLD HER MECHANICALLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE I'M NOT REGISTERED IZZY GRINNED
HATE TO DO IT BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE THE NEXT SHIFT AT MAIN AND BROAD DIRECTING TRAFFIC
TAKE THAT--CAPTAIN AT LARGE--AND CONSCRIPT ANY OF THE MUNICIPAL FORCE YOU WANT UP TO A HUNDRED
HE COULDN'T BREAK HIS JOB WITH THE POLICE--IF HE DID HE'D BE BROUGHT BACK AS A CRIMINAL
CAPTAIN HENDRIX AND SOME OF HIS MEN WANTED TO COME BACK WITH FULL BATTLE EQUIPMENT AND CHASE THEM OUT
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND WENT SHUFFLING BACK TO HIS ROOM WHERE TWO OF HIS PART-TIME HENCHMEN WERE SITTING
PAPPA IS DEAD GOD FORBID IT
THE CROOPSTERS WERE LOYAL TO WAYNE
A NICE CLEAN KID--JUST LIKE MY OWN BOY WAS
AT LEAST IT WOULD STALL THINGS OFF FOR A WHILE
SHEILA COREY HAD STOPPED AT A SAFE DISTANCE
THEN A POUNDING SOUND CAME FROM THE SECOND FLOOR AND GORDON DREW BACK INTO THE DENSER SHADOWS STARING UPWARDS
COPS HE SAID TO THE SIX MOBSTERS WHO SURROUNDED THE BOOTH
HE STUCK TO THE ALLEYS NOT USING THE HEADLIGHTS AFTER HE HAD LOCKED THE TWO IN AND STARTED THE ELECTRIC MOTOR
WHAT YOU DO OUTSIDE MY PLACE IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS
AS HE WATCHED A HUGE MAN REACHED OVER ONE OF THE CARS PICKED UP A STAR POINT MAN AND LIFTED HIM BEHIND THE BARRICADE
THE PLANTERS HAD THINGS IN ORDER
EARTH WAS FINALLY TAKING A HAND
THAT'S THE WAY A PANIC IS COBBER THE MAN SAID
FINISHED HE WENT UP TO ONE OF THE MEN FROM THE SHIP HANDED OVER AN ENVELOPE AND CAME BACK TO START THE TRUCK BACK TOWARD MARSPORT
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TRENCH
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY WHY NOT PUSH IT OURSELVES GORDON ASKED IN DISGUST
DID YOU MAKE EM GIVE YOU MY BEAT HE SEEMED GENUINELY PLEASED AS GORDON NODDED AND THEN DROPPED IT TO POINT TO RANDOLPH
HE APPLAUDED ALL THE SPEECHES ABOUT HOW MUCH MAYOR WAYNE HAD DONE FOR THEM AND SIGNED THE PLEDGE EXPRESSING HIS CONFIDENCE ALONG WITH THE IMPLIED DUTY HE HAD TO MAKE HIS BEAT VOTE RIGHT
I'LL GO IN THIS ONE THE PROPRIETOR WAS A DRUGGIST WHO RAN HIS OWN FOUNTAIN WHERE THE SYNTHETICS THAT REPLACED HONEST EARTH FOODS WERE COMPOUNDED INTO SWEET AND STICKY MESSES FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS
AND DRIVING THE TRUCK WAS SHEILA
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARRIVE BRUCE SHE WAS SHIVERING
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
GET MY CAR--UP THE STREET--CALL ARLISS ON THE PHONE--UNDER THE DASH
WHEN HE WENT OUT THE STREET WAS GOING CRAZY
HE TOLD ABOUT A MAN WHO'D COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR HIS KIDS NOT STOPPING AS PRAEGER'S FACE SICKENED SLOWLY
WHO ELECTED YOU CHIEF MARTYR AROUND HERE
COBBER STOP TEASING ME
HE CONSIDERED WHAT A MAN OUT HERE WHO WENT UNDER THAT NAME MIGHT BE LIKE
ONE OF THE SQUADS WAS JUMPED BY A GANG OF ABOUT FORTY AND TWO OF THE MEN WERE KILLED BEFORE THE NEAREST OTHER SQUAD COULD PULL A REAR ATTACK
GOOD GOOD
TECHNICALLY THE BOY WAS AN ENEMY TO ALL MUNICIPALS
NO NEED TO ASK WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MURDOCH'S RECOMMENDATION
IN THERE IT WAS A SHOUT FROM OUTSIDE
I'VE BEEN READING YOUR RECORD
THIS TIME IZZY MADE NO PROTEST
HE HAD ISSUED EXTRA DOPE AND MANAGED A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE RATION SO THEY MADE A BRAVE SHOWING--UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DOME
BUT WHATEVER YOUR REASONS YOU'LL BE USEFUL
I CAN GET THE STUFF SENT GORDON
THEY LOOKED UP AND HE MOVED FORWARD DRAGGING A BADGE FROM HIS POUCH
BUT THE SECOND DAY TWO OF THE CITIZENS FELL INTO STEP BEHIND HIM ALMOST AT ONCE ARMED WITH HEAVY CLUBS
THE INJURY SEEMED ONLY A SCALP WOUND AND THE OLD MAN WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROAN
POVERTY AND MISERY WERE THE KEYNOTES HERE RATHER THAN THE EVIL HALF-WORLD THE DRUMMER HAD BABBLED ABOUT
HERE IN CLOSE QUARTERS THE ATTACKERS WERE NO LONGER USING KNIVES
AND NEWS FOR THE PAPER IF I EVER PUBLISH IT AGAIN
THEY CROSSED THE STREET AND WENT DOWN HALF A BLOCK
HONEST IZZY FINALLY SEEMED SATISFIED TO TURN THINGS OVER TO THE REGULAR NIGHT MEN
EARTH HAS DECLARED WAR ON US
THERE WAS A SHARP YELL FROM ONE OF THE MEN IN THE BACKGROUND AND A KNIFE SAILED FOR HIM BUT THE AIM WAS POOR
THERE WAS HUNGER AND STRAIN ON HIS FACE BUT AN ODD AUTHORITY AND PRIDE NOW
AFTER YOUR DEAL WITH PRAEGER WE'D PROBABLY FOLLOW YOU ANYHOW
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OPENINGS FOR ALL THE GOOD MEN BUT
IT LOOKS AS IF YOU'LL HAVE TO ARREST HER OKAY
VOTING BY MACHINE HAD NEVER BEEN ESTABLISHED HERE
BUT YOU TWO BETTER GET GOING
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU CHAPTER XVI GET THE DOME
HIS EYES NARROWED AS HE SPOTTED GORDON
POLICE SERGEANT GORDON ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS HE SAID CURTLY
HE SLIPPED HIS FEW POSSESSIONS INTO A BAG AT HIS BELT SLID THE KNIFE INTO A SPRING HOLSTER ABOVE HIS WRIST AND PICKED UP THE BOWL-SHAPED HELMET
SHE PUT DOWN THE HOT WATER AND PICKED UP THE BOTTLE OF BRANDY STARTING DOWN THE STAIRS
NO SENSE JAILING HIM YET
JUST MAKING PLANS FOR TOMORROW HE WATCHED HER TURN BACK SLOWLY THEN LAY QUIETLY TRYING NOT TO DISTURB HER AGAIN
MURDOCH GAVE GORDON A BRIEF TIRED SMILE AND STARTED FOR THE STAIRS
I'LL BE CLEANING FOR A WEEK SHE SAID
SMELL THAT AIR--EVEN I CAN SMELL IT HE SNIFFED DOLEFULLY
WITHOUT THE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AN AIRSUIT GORDON MOVED IN HIS ARM JERKING FORWARD
ACH GOTT SHE BREATHED
HE CONSIDERED STAYING IN TRENCH'S CAR AND LETTING IT ROLL PAST HIM
THEY NEEDED MEN ON MARS WHO COULD ACT AS LINKS IN THEIR INFORMATION BUREAU AND BE READY TO WORK ON THEIR SIDE WHEN THE EXPECTED TROUBLE CAME
AND MAYBE--MAYBE I'M NOT
HE WAS PUFFING NOW MOPPING RIVULETS OF PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FACE
HE MOVED FORWARD TO THE PRESS STARING AT IT AND THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE RAN HIS HANDS OVER THE BROKEN METAL
HE LOOKED BACK JUST AS BULLETS BEGAN TO LAND AGAINST THE METAL OF THE CAR
ONE ARM WAS JERKED BACK BEHIND HIM THEN THE OTHER WAS FORCED UP TO IT
THEN HE STOPPED AS SOMETHING NIBBLED AT HIS MIND
BUT RUMORS WERE CIRCULATING WILDLY
HE SAW THE PIKE COMING DOWN AND TRIED TO DUCK
IT BROKE OPEN BEFORE HE COULD REACH IT THE SEAL SNAPPING BACK TO SHOW A GIANT OF A MAN OUTSIDE HOLDING THE TWO GUARDS FROM ACROSS THE STREET WHILE A SCAR-FACED DARK MAN SHOVED THROUGH BRISKLY
THE SALOONS WERE DOING WELL ENOUGH APPARENTLY FROM THE NUMBER THAT STREAMED IN THROUGH THEIR AIRLOCK ENTRANCES
HERE SIT OVER THERE
HIS FOOT FOUND THE BUTTON SNAPPING THE ENTRANCE OPEN
THAT WAS ALL TRENCH AND THE POLICE GANG HAD TO SEE
TO GORDON'S SURPRISE THE PUBLICITY RANDOLPH WROTE ABOUT HIS BEING A SECURITY PRIME SEEMED TO BRING THE OTHER SECTIONS OF OUTER MARSPORT UNDER THE VOLUNTEER POLICE CONTROL EVEN FASTER
GOV'NOR EARTH MUST BE BOILING ABOUT THE ELECTION
BETTER SEND OUT THE WAGON TRENCH HESITATED ONLY A FRACTION OF A SECOND
GANNETT DIDN'T WANT MOTHER COREY TO THINK THE MUNICIPALS WERE KINDER THAN THE LEGALS SO YOU'RE IN THE ONLY NEUTRAL TERRITORY IN MARSPORT
SHE SAID IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE DONE GOV'NOR SO I FIGURED YOU'D KNOW ABOUT IT GORDON SHRUGGED AND LET IT PASS
I WASN'T KIDDING ABOUT YOUR BEING A GOOD MAN GORDON
BRUCE GORDON STOOD IN THE MOTLEY CROWD INSIDE THE BARNLIKE ROOM WHERE FATS RAN A BAR ALONG ONE WALL AND FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE WITH ASSORTED TABLES--ALL WORN
NOW HE WAS RETURNING WITH A CLUB
HE CROUCHED IN A HOLLOW THAT HAD ONCE BEEN SOME KIND OF A BASEMENT UNTIL THE SHIPS HAD LANDED AND CUT OFF THEIR JETS
SHE SAW HIM COMING CAST A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE KNIFE THAT HAD BEEN KNOCKED FROM HER HANDS THEN SPRANG ASIDE AND DARTED BACK THROUGH THE PARKED TRUCKS
THEY'VE LEFT EARTH BEHIND AND THEY'RE MEETING THIS PLANET ON ITS OWN TERMS
YOU'VE BEEN A SPY FOR A YELLOW SCANDAL SHEET
WHY DON'T YOU TWO GET MARRIED AND MAKE YOUR FIGHTING LEGAL THANKS FOR THE COFFEE GORDON THREW BACK AT HIM
THE SCOUTS TOOK CARE OF MOST OF THE TROUBLE THOUGH A FEW SHOTS PINGED AGAINST THE TRUCK GORDON WAS DRIVING
HE MOTIONED TO MURDOCH AND JUMPED TO HELP THE FAILING MAN TO THE ENTRANCE
HE STOPPED FINALLY TEN BLOCKS OF NARROW ALLEYS AWAY AND PUT MURDOCH DOWN
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A TEAR GLISTENED IN HIS EYES
NOT A BIT
HE'D TRIED TO HELP THE SUCKERS IN HIS COLUMN AND HERE HE WAS
SATISFIED HE WHEELED SUDDENLY AND SPOTTED HER BEHIND HIM BEFORE SHE COULD SLIP OUT OF SIGHT
WELL I GUESS YOU GET OUT HERE HE INDICATED THE COOP
HE HAD SEEN CROWDS BEGINNING TO ASSEMBLE ALL AFTERNOON BUT HAD PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM
COPS ARE SUPPOSED TO TURN IT IN TRENCH WAS ALMOST JOVIAL WHEN HE WEIGHED THE PACKAGE AND EXAMINED IT TO FIND HOW MUCH IT HAD BEEN CUT
XVII SECURITY PAYOFF POLICE YOUR PLANET CHAPTER I ONE WAY TICKET THERE WERE TEN PASSENGERS IN THE LITTLE PRESSURIZED CABIN OF THE ELECTRIC BUS THAT SHUTTLED BETWEEN THE ROCKET FIELD AND MARSPORT
AND WHEN YOU GET OVER THIS YOU'RE GONNA ANNOUNCE NEW PLANS TO TRY AGAIN
HIS KNIFE FLASHED UP
FIVE MINUTES LATER IT WAS FULL DAYLIGHT WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SIGNAL FOR THE WORKERS TO START FOR THEIR JOBS
BUT I GUESS SHEILA HAD THE ROUGHEST END NOT EVEN KNOWING FOR SURE WHERE I STOOD GORDON STARED AT THEM SLOWLY NOT QUITE BELIEVING IT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NO CRAZIER THAN ANYTHING ELSE DURING THE PAST FEW HOURS
BRUCE I'M ALL RIGHT
BUT NOW THE QUIETNESS HAD BEEN BROKEN
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE GHOST OF AN IDEA AS TO WHAT SECURITY WANTED OF HIM OR WHERE THEY WERE HIDING THEMSELVES
THE STORY WAS SOMEWHAT COOLER THAN THAT BUT NOT MUCH
HE WAS APPARENTLY AS FAMILIAR WITH THE GARROTE AS THE KNIFE
BRUCE--I DON'T HAVE IT
SHE SCREAMED AND BEGAN WRITHING TWISTING HER HARD YOUNG BODY LIKE A BOA CONSTRICTOR IN HIS HANDS
THE ENGINE BACKED BRIEFLY
THE FABRIC OF IT WAS THIN AND EVEN THE WEBBING STRAPS THAT GAVE IT ADDED STRENGTH WERE FRAIL THINGS
THE DEPORTEE LET HIS GLANCE JERK TO IT THEN FROZE
BUT I GUESS THEY DIDN'T REACH YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT GORDON SHOOK HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY WHILE THE NERVES BUNCHED AND TINGLED IN HIS NECK
IT WAS AN INTERNAL ADAPTATION LIKE THE ONE THAT HAD OCCURRED IN TEST ANIMALS REARED AT A SIMULATED FORTY-THOUSAND-FEET ALTITUDE ON EARTH BEFORE MARS WAS EVER SETTLED
HERE HE HANDED HER THE KEY TO THE CONNECTING DOOR
HE CHECKED THE BATTERIES ON HIS SUIT AND PUT IT ON QUICKLY
THE LITTLE HOMEMADE BOMB LANDED BOUNCED AND LAY STILL WITH ITS FUSE ALMOST BURNED DOWN
IF HE CAUSED TROUBLE ENOUGH THEY COULD STILL SHIP HIM TO MERCURY
HE PASSED A SOUND TRUCK BLATTING OUT A CAMPAIGN SPEECH BY CANDIDATE NOLAN FILLED WITH TOO-OBVIOUS FACTS ABOUT THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION TOGETHER WITH HINTS THAT WAYNE HAD PAID TO HAVE NOLAN ASSASSINATED
GORDON WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE WASN'T BEATEN BUT NOT WHEN THE RACKETEER SUGGESTED THAT ANY MONEY FOUND AT A CRIME WAS EVIDENCE AND SHOULD GO TO THE POLICE
I'M A SICK MAN
BUT I HEAR ROBBERY WENT DOWN ON YOUR BEAT LAST NIGHT
HIS FINGERS CLOSED A VALVE EQUIPPED WITH A COMBINATION LOCK
HE DROPPED HER NEAR THE BED AND WENT OVER TO MURDOCH
HE KNEW BY THE MAN'S FACE THAT NO PROTECTION HAD BEEN PAID HIGHER UP
HE GRIMACED AT THE ONE WAY STAMPED ON IT THEN TORE IT INTO BITS AND LET THE PIECES SCATTER OVER THE FLOOR
OR RATHER HIS MOB
I MEAN THIS BUSINESS OF USING AMMONIA
WE'RE LATE
I TOLD HIM AND TOLD HIM--AND THEN
THEY DIDN'T SPEAK UNTIL TRENCH STOPPED IN FRONT OF MOTHER COREY'S PLACE
GORDON'S HAND HAD ALREADY KNOTTED A COUPLE OF COINS INTO HIS KERCHIEF
AFTER COLLECTING IZZY LED THE WAY INTO A SECTION MARKED SPECIAL TAXES AND WHISPERED A FEW CASUAL WORDS
WELL
IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS FROM THE PROVEN RAPACITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION HERE EARTH HAS REVOKED THE INDEPENDENT CHARTER OF MARSPORT
A GRIN WRITHED ONTO HIS FACE AND BROKE INTO SUDDEN GRUDGING LAUGHTER
THERE WAS A SCREAM AS THEIR AUTOMATIC ATTEMPTS TO SAVE THEMSELVES BURIED BOTH KNIVES IN THE BODY OF THEIR FRIEND
NOW IN THERE THEY SLICED INTO A SMALL TUNNEL SCRAPING THEIR SIDES WHERE IT WAS BARELY BIG ENOUGH FOR THE TRUCK
THE PRESSURE OF THE BEAT TOOK HIS MIND FROM IT
AT ONE TIME THERE HAD BEEN A SMALL DOME AND A TINY CITY DEVOTED TO THE ROCKET FIELD
GORDON STUCK THE TICKETS INTO HIS WALLET
MAYBE NOT THEY SPENT THE REST OF THE NIGHT DISCUSSING IT
GORDON YOU'RE A SELF-MADE LOUSE BUT YOU'RE A MAN UNDERNEATH IT SOMEWHERE
YEAH HE SAID AGAIN
GORDON WAITED TRYING TO SWALLOW THEIR PETTY PUNISHMENTS BUT IT WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN
CASH IN HIS CHIPS THEN HIS POUCHY EYES TURNED TO GORDON
HE WAITED UNTIL THE CROWD HAD THINNED OUT A LITTLE AND BEGAN HEADING TOWARD COREY'S WITH IZZY MOVING ALONG SILENTLY BESIDE HIM CARRYING HALF THE PACKAGES
HE PROTESTED VIGOROUSLY IN SPITE OF A SUSPICIOUS BRUISE ALONG HIS TEMPLE AND FINALLY MADE SOME OF THE PROTESTS STICK
HE ROLLED OVER AND PATTED HER SHOULDER
SHE RELAXED AFTER A SECOND
IT WAS ONLY TOWARD THAT THAT THE SHAKING FISTS WERE RAISED
WELL NO MATTER
OKAY RANDY WE'LL FIND THEM
GET BACK
GET BACK
DID YOU FIND THEM COBBER HE ASKED QUICKLY AND ONE OF HIS EYELIDS FLICKERED
SUPPOSE I RENT A ROOM AND PUT A GOOD LOCK ON IT
AND ALL THE MONEY--THE MONEY WE HAD TO PAY TO GET STOCKS TO SELL TO PAY OFF FROM THE PROFITS WE DON'T MAKE--ALL OF IT HE WANTS
I HAD A HELL OF A TIME GETTING THEM TO TAKE IT EASY
LEFT SHARP IZZY SHOUTED
THEY WERE DROPPING RAPIDLY
ALL RIGHT HE SAID
MOTHER COREY LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND THEN BACK TO GORDON
HE HAD BECOME ALMOST SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT THE WAY HE WAS ALWAYS LEFT WITH NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED CREDITS IN HIS POCKETS
HONESTY PAYS GOV'NOR IF YOU SQUEEZE IT ONCE IN A WHILE
THE FORCE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOOLED WHEN IZZY PAID HIS PLEDGE AND THEY'D MARK HIM DOWN AS DISLOYAL--IF THEY DIDN'T AUTOMATICALLY MARK DOWN ALL WHO'D SERVED UNDER MURDOCH
YOU MIGHT GUESS THAT THE COPS WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET HOLD OF YOUR WIFE NOW THOUGH
IT WAS ALMOST GOOD TO GET OUT INTO THE FILTH OF THE SLUMS AND BE HEADING BACK TO THE STILL-STANDING MONUMENT OF THE OLD CHICKEN COOP
GORDON TOSSED THE ROLL OF BILLS ONTO THE FLOOR BESIDE HER
SAME OLD ANGLES EH
THEN GRIMACED AND TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR WHERE HIS UNIFORM STILL LAY
I'VE CHECKED THROUGH HIS TAX FORMS AND THEY'RE ALL IN ORDER
IT ALL HAD A CURIOUS FEELING OF UNREALITY
A HEAVY VOICE PICKED UP THE EXCHANGE OF SHOUTS
IT WAS OBVIOUS HE'D SPENT THE NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP
BUT THE WAYNE MAN TOUCHED HIS ARM AND INDICATED A BALLOT
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WILL BE BY APPOINTMENT UNTIL LEGAL ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD SAFELY
WHEN DO WE GET OUR MONEY PLEASE
WE'LL PULL ANOTHER FALSE RAID ON THE DOME
SHE FINISHED THE PATCH AND RAN PERMA-SEALER OVER IT
THEN SHE GRIMACED FAINTLY AND DROPPED DOWN BESIDE HIM ON TOP OF THE BLANKET
SHE STARED AT THE BRANDY BOTTLE SICKLY
THE CRUSADER WAS STRICTLY A ONE-MAN WEEKLY AGAINST MAYOR WAYNE'S CHRONICLE WITH ITS EARTH-COMICS AND DAILY CIRCULATION OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND
THERE WAS A SURPRISED EXCHANGE OF GLANCES FROM THE OTHERS BUT MOTHER COREY CHUCKLED
OH IT'S YOU GORDON WHERE'S CAPTAIN TRENCH THE HEAVY FEATURES DIDN'T CHANGE AS JURGENS CHUCKLED
BUT THERE WAS LITTLE GRUMBLING
FUNNY YOU MAKING SERGEANT
I'LL SAND THESE SHE STARTED TO PROTEST THEN LET HIM TAKE OVER
WE'VE BEEN BLIND--THE WHOLE DAMNED PLANET HAS BEEN BLIND SHE BLINKED AND THEN FROWNED
THE NEXT MORNING THEY ARRIVED AT THE PRECINCT HOUSE TO FIND MEN MILLING AROUND THE BULLETIN BOARD BUZZING OVER AN ANNOUNCEMENT THERE
RANDOLPH PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE DEAD MEN NOR TO THE BRUISES ON HIS OWN BODY
HE GETS SICKER OF KILLING OFF A PLANET HE'S LEARNED TO LIKE
STANDING BESIDE MURDOCH THEY WERE MOVING FORWARD
IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN SECONDS TRENCH'S VOICE BARKED OUT OF THE PHONE
STOREKEEPERS IN THE CHEAP LITTLE SHOPS HAD THE SAME LINES ON THEIR FACES AS THEY SAW ON THOSE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS
HE COLLECTED DOWN TO THE LAST ACCOUNT
PICKINGS ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE LEAN ON THE FIRST FEW BEATS BUT YOU CAN WORK SOME FAIRLY WELL GORDON'S CHEST FELL
THE KID HAD JUMPED ASIDE WITH A LITHE LEAP AND NOW STOOD BETWEEN GORDON AND THE GROUP MOVING IN FOR THE KILL
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO SEE YOU SO I VOLUNTEERED TO RUN OUT SOME RED TAPE FOR YOUR CAPTAIN
GORDON CHECKED HIS SPEED THREW HIMSELF FLAT AND ROLLED BACK AGAINST THE BUILDING JUST BEYOND THE STEPS THAT LED TO THE STREET
THE FEW OF EITHER POLICE FORCE STILL STANDING AND HELMETED BROKE INTO A WILD RUN BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE
IN A SECOND HE WAS PULLED DOWN AND THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD
THEY MUST HAVE HAD REPORTS ON ELECTIONS BEFORE THIS DAMN THE TROUBLE
THEY'LL BE SAFE HERE SO WILL YOU NOW THAT YOU'VE MADE UP WITH THE MOTHER HE TOLD HER
ONE'S THE RESULT OF THE OTHER MURDOCH TOLD HIM
OR COFFEE COFFEE HE FORCED HIMSELF UP AGAIN
HE'D SWALLOWED THE IMPLICATION THAT THE LEGALS WERE SECURITY
AFTER THAT WE'VE GOT A NEW JOB FOR YOU CHAPTER IV CAPTAIN MURDOCH THE NEW ASSIGNMENT WAS TO THE ROUGHEST SECTION IN ALL MARSPORT--THE SLUM AREA BEYOND THE DOME OUT NEAR THE ROCKET FIELD
GORDON TOOK THEM DOWN AND THEN RETURNED WITH THE MAN TO THE OTHERS
GOV'NOR IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND THE PLAIN GEES PAY MY SALARY WHO'S PAYING ME TO START FIGHTING OTHER COPS
THERE WAS AN UNDERTONE OF HUSHED WAITING WITH THE SHARP BURSTS OF HAMMERING AND LAST-MINUTE WORK STANDING OUT SHARPLY THROUGH IT
VERY TOUCHING COBBER
WAYNE'LL WIN BUT NOT THAT EASY
WE'RE SELLING ELECTION PROTECTION
WIDOWS AND ORPHANS SURE APPRECIATE A GOOD MAN HE SAID
THE PUSHER WAS WELL-HEELED
TRENCH WAS LAVISH IN HIS PRAISE
YOU CAN'T A ROPE ROSE FROM THE CROWD AND SETTLED AROUND HIM
BOXES WERE PILED ALL AROUND IT AND OTHERS WERE BEING TOSSED OUT
OKAY I'LL BE OUT IN TEN MINUTES GORDON CLUMPED BACK TO THE ALLEY AND BENT FOR A FINAL INSPECTION OF MURDOCH'S BODY TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WOULD PROVE THE FLAWS IN HIS WEAKLY BUILT STORY
HE STUFFED IT BACK DUCKING A BLOW
BUT NOT NOW
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO HAVE THANKS GORDON SAID CURTLY
HE PICKED UP THE STUFF FROM HIS BED AND STARTED TO SWEEP IT ASIDE BEFORE HE LAY DOWN
SHEILA HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE BUNK STILL IN HER AIRSUIT
GIVE IT TO HER--AND IF YOU TELL HER IT CAME FROM ME I'LL RIP OUT YOUR GUTS HE GOT UP SUDDENLY AND HOBBLED OUT HIS PINCHED FACE WORKING
IT WAS THE LAST PLACE WHERE HE'D BE EXPECTED TO DO HIS DUTY BY WAYNE'S ADMINISTRATION
SCHULBERG MOTIONED HIM INTO THE CAB OF THE TRUCK AND THE OTHER TWO CLIMBED INTO THE CLOSED REAR SECTION
BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS PART OF MARSPORT OBVIOUS
THE TWO AMBUSHERS WERE DOWN IN A TANGLED MESS
FROM THE APPROACHING CARS PIPES PROJECTED FORWARD
GORDON THREW HIMSELF BACK
THE GOVERNMENT'S JUST WAITING TO STEP IN
RAT-FACE JERKED BACK BEHIND THE BIG HULK OF HIS PARTNER TRYING TO PULL A GUN THAT SEEMED TO BE STUCK
THEN HE HELD HIS BREATH WAITING
FINALLY HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS CARRYING MURDOCH WITH HIM
PICK OUT ANY PLACE YOU WANT TRAIN THEM TO HANDLE THOSE DAMNED LEGALS THE WAY MURDOCH HANDLED THE STONEWALL BOYS
HERE--YOU'LL NEED DIRECTIONS FOR FINDING PRAEGER HE HANDED THE PAPER WITH HIS SCRAWLED NOTES ON IT OVER TO GORDON AND WENT SHUFFLING BACK
GORDON BEGAN ORGANIZING HIS OWN SQUAD
IT WAS NOW EXTENDED TO COVER ABOUT HALF THE AREA AS A VOLUNTARY POLICE ORGANIZATION
THEN A SURPRISINGLY COMPETENT DOCTOR EXAMINED HIS WOUND REBANDAGED IT AND SENT HIM HOME FOR THE DAY
INSIDE IT WAS WORSE
HE LOOKED DOWN AT MURDOCH'S SHOULDER
THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MUCH SHE'D HEARD OR WHETHER SHE'D TIPPED OTHERS OFF
YEAH THE LEGALS WANT THE CRUSADER FOR THEIR PROPAGANDA HE SAID WEARILY
THEN HE REACHED FOR THE POUCH
HER VOICE CAUGHT ON THAT
BUT RIGHT NOW YOU GET YOURSELF DRUNK HE LEFT GORDON AND THE BOTTLE
BUT THAT'S OVER NOW--THEY GAVE ME HELL FOR INCITING VIGILANTE ACTION AND CONFINED ME INSIDE THE DOME
HEY ED DOWN THE STREET THE SEAL OF A BUILDING OPENED AND THE BIG BLUFF FIGURE OF PRAEGER CAME OUT
THEN ANOTHER TRUCK ROLLED INTO VIEW AND THE MAYOR'S CANNED VOICE CAME OVER IT PANTING AS IF HE'D HAD TO RUSH TO MAKE THE RECORDING
HIS EYES SHOT UP TO WHERE THE FEW DIM LIGHTS WERE REFLECTED OFF THE GREAT PLASTIC SHEET THAT WAS HELD UP BY AIR PRESSURE AND REINFORCED WITH HEAVY WEBBING
GORDON FISHED INTO THE POCKET OF HIS UNIFORM FOR PAPER AND A PENCIL TO LEAVE A NOTE IN CASE IZZY CAME BACK
AM I A KILLER TOO THAT I SHOULD STRIKE A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL
WHEN MY OWN GRANDDAUGHTER COMES CRYING FOR HELP
NO WONDER THE BOYS COULDN'T FIND WHERE YOU'D STASHED HIM MOTHER
MY MOTHER'S WEDDING RING
BUT A MAN GETS SICK OF WORKING WITH PUNKS AND CHEAP HOODS
AND AT LAST HE STIRRED AND REACHED FOR THE YELLOW STUB
SHE'S OUT SHOPPING THE CAR PULLED UP TO THE WAITING ROCKET AND THE SECURITY MAN HELPED HIM UP THE STEPS WITH A PERFUNCTORY WISH FOR GOOD LUCK
GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP TAKE THE NEXT DAY OFF
AS GORDON DREW CLOSER TO THE OLD FOUNDATION OF THE DOME THE FEELING AROUND BEGAN TO CLARIFY INTO SOMETHING HALFWAY BETWEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN ON THE REAL FRONTIER AND WHAT HE HAD KNOWN AS A KID IN EARTH'S SLUMS
OH WELL THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO COBBER
SHIELDS CAUGHT THEM FRANTICALLY AND THEN THE KID WAS IN WITH A HEAVY CLUB HE'D TORN FROM SOMEONE'S HAND
IT AIN'T MUCH--BUT GET WHAT YOU CAN HE SWUNG THE TRUCK AND WAS GONE
HE WAS POINTING TO A LEAD-FOIL-COVERED BOX
MRS MARY EDELSTEIN SHE WAS SAYING
THERE WAS NO SENSE IN TRYING TO GET MORE THAN THE VAGUEST ORGANIZATION
YOU DO ALL THE WRONG THINGS BUT YOU GET THE RIGHT RESULTS
THE WETNESS CAME FROM TEARS THAT SPILLED OUT OF HER EYES AND RAN OFF ONTO THE MATTRESS
THEY COULDN'T PREVENT ADVANCE WARNING BUT THEY COULD DELAY AND MINIMIZE IT
HERE WAS THE REAL MARS--THE MEN WHO LIKED IT HERE WHO WERE SURE OF THEIR FUTURE
IT WASN'T A PRETTY VIEW THAT VISITORS GOT AS THEY FIRST REACHED MARS
GORDON COUNTED OUT THE MONEY RELUCTANTLY WHILE IZZY EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE COPS
HE STUDIED IT TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT A TRUCK WOULD BE DOING HERE
PRIVATE HOUSES WERE BOARDED UP
BUT THERE HAD TO BE STILL MORE BEFORE NIGHT
THE WAY THEY HATE A DECENT COP HERE YOU'D THINK HONESTY WAS CONTAGIOUS YEAH GORDON PREFERRED TO LET IT DROP
ON ITS SIDE WAS PAINTED THE COLORS OF THE PLANTERS
TWO OF THE STONEWALL BOYS WERE WORKING OVER A TALL MAN IN A NEWER AIRSUIT
I'M DAMNED GLAD YOU WERE FOLLOWING ME SO'M I GORDON
HE STOPPED NOT TOO QUICKLY AND LISTENED BUT EVERYTHING WAS STILL
THE MAN MIGHT BE A LOUSE BUT HE WAS ALSO A FIGHTING MACHINE OF FIRST ORDER STILL
JUST BLOODY WELL-INFORMED GOV'NOR
HE TURNED SLOWLY BACK TO THE CAR AND FELT IT GET UNDER WAY
SECURITY DENOUNCES RAPE OF MARSPORT
AND I HOPE WE AIN'T TOO BLOODY LATE THE BUILDING WAS A WRECK OUTSIDE
HE HAD HIS DOUBTS
AT LEAST HE SAID HE WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING AND IT WAS ABOUT THAT SIZE
MARS HAS HAD ENOUGH
YOU MUST HAVE HAD SOME REASON FOR BRINGING HER HERE COBBER I WANT HER OUT OF MY HAIR MOTHER GORDON TRIED TO EXPLAIN
TRENCH WAS QUITE RIGHT
HE ISSUED THEM SLIPS WHICH THEY ADDED AS PART OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS
FOOD READY IN TEN MINUTES SHE TOLD HIM
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE GOT ME THAT NIGHT FATS THE OTHER SHRUGGED
GORDON SWUNG TO RUN AND FOUND HIMSELF SURROUNDED
D'YOU THINK I'D--I'D--ONE ROOM IN THE PLACE WITH A DECENT DOOR AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHY I'D CHOOSE THAT ROOM TO KEEP JURGENS DEVILS BACK
BRUCE SHE SAID FAINTLY YOU MEANT IT
BUT IT DON'T MEAN WE CAN'T SHOW HOW WELL WE LIKE THE MAYOR
FOR HIDING AND A CONVOY BACK OUR CAPTAIN TRENCH GAVE ME A PAPER WITH IMMUNITY FROM THE MUNICIPAL FORCE
THE COUPLE AT THE LIQUOR STORE HAD THEIR PAYMENT WAITING AND THEY HANDED IT OVER LOOKING EMBARRASSED
GORDON'S GUN CAME OUT
IF YOU HADN'T REPORTED IN
HEAR THAT SIREN GOV'NOR
WE KNOW ABOUT MURDOCH AND WE KNOW WHERE TRENCH IS--BUT HE'S A GOOD CITIZEN NOW SO HE CAN STAY THERE
STOP WORRYING ABOUT IT SHE THREW HERSELF SIDEWAYS AS FAR FROM HIM AS SHE COULD GET
RANDOLPH PICKED IT OUT OF HIS HAND
THEN IT FLASHED OPEN ALL THE WAY
HE SCANNED THE STREET JUMPED TO THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE LIQUOR STORE AND BEGAN BANGING ON IT
YOUR MEAL TICKET'S RUINED CUDDLES AND YOU MADE IT CLEAR A LITTLE WHILE AGO JUST WHERE YOU STAND
THIS TIME IT EVEN TASTED GOOD TO HIM
FELLOW MARTIANS THEY AREN'T GOING TO BRIBE US INTO THAT
WHAT THE HELL DO THEY WANT IT FOR IZZY JERKED A SHOULDER UPWARDS AND A TWIST RAN ACROSS HIS POCK-MARKED FACE
THIS IS ED PRAEGER
THE GEE WAS HEELED CORPORAL
COME ON IZZY HE SAID
I NEED TWO MEN WHO CAN KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT THEY IDLED AROUND THE STATION THROUGH THE MORNING
GORDON MOVED DOWN UNPAVED STREETS THAT ZIG-ZAGGED ALONG THICK WITH THE FILTH OF GARBAGE AND POVERTY--THE PART OF MARS NEVER SEEN IN THE NEWSREELS OUTSIDE THE SHOCK MOVIES
THEY WERE JUST NEARING A POLLING PLACE WHEN A HEAVY TRUCK CAME CAREENING AROUND A CORNER
SOMETHING TO DISCUSS GORDON
HE FUMBLED IN HIS POCKETS AS IF LOOKING FOR A LIGHT
THE WAYNE MAN NODDED AND THERE WAS NO PROTEST
IN A MARTIAN ROULETTE GAME NUMBERS WITH THAT MUCH RIDING JUST DIDN'T TURN UP
HIS BIG LEAN BODY WAS SLUMPED SLIGHTLY IN THE SEAT
HE KEPT GLANCING BACK WHENEVER HE WAS IN THE THICKER SHADOWS BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ONE FOLLOWING HIM
SHE BIT HER LIPS AND TURNED BACK WHILE A SLOW FLUSH RAN OVER HER FACE
THERE WAS ONE CHANCE
MARS WAS A FINE PLANET FOR PICKING UP EASY MONEY--BUT HOLDING IT WAS ANOTHER MATTER
GORDON STUMBLED INTO SOMEONE AHEAD OF HIM AND SAW IT WAS TRENCH
AND THE COPS WERE REACHING FOR THEIR GUNS
BY FRIDAY HE HAD LEARNED
LIKE I ALWAYS SAID HONESTY SURE PAYS EVEN IF IT KILLS YOU
YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT SECURITY BADGES TO KNOW THEY CAN'T BE FORGED
ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE SWOLLEN
I'M GRADE THREE MYSELF AND I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT YOU'D HAVE SHIPPED IN ALL THE FOOD WE NEEDED FREE GORDON ASKED
STAY WITH ME I'LL TELL YOU HOW PAPPA AND I GOT MARRIED
WELL WE'LL GET IN ENOUGH FOOD THIS WAY TO KEEP YOU GOING FOR A WHILE--COUPLE OF WEEKS AT LEAST IT SOUNDED GOOD AND MIGHT HAVE WORKED IF THERE HAD BEEN THE NORMAL FOOD RESERVE OR IF THE OTHER THREE QUADRANTS HAD BEEN WILLING TO DO AS MUCH
THEN AS THEY IDENTIFIED GORDON THEY MOVED BACK AGAIN
THEY TOOK ALL THE MONEY AND NOW WE'RE CLEANED OUT
HE HAD SIX HUNDRED LEFT
AND GO ON HOME
GIVE ME A HAND AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF ALL THIS
BUT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE IT HERE
HE HAD STARTED FORWARD AFTER THE KID BUT IZZY WAS IN FRONT OF HIM HOLDING HIM BACK
HE HAD NO USE FOR THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION BUT EARTH HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE OVER WITHOUT A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AND A CHANCE FOR THE PEOPLE TO STATE THEIR CHOICE
BEST WEEK IN THE TERRITORY FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS
ONE OF THEM WAS JURGENS APELIKE FOLLOWER HIS STUPID FACE RELAXED AND VACANT
JUST A MATTER OF CO-ORDINATION CUDDLES HE TOLD HER
BUT EITHER YOU'RE LOYAL NOW OR I CAN'T DEPEND ON ANYONE BEING LOYAL DURING THE NIGHT IT SEEMED THE LEGAL FORCE HAD BEEN RECRUITING
FATE'S AGAINST ME COBBER
GORDON GRUNTED
HIS OTHER HAND CHOPPED AROUND AND THE EDGE OF HIS PALM CONNECTED WITH THE OTHER'S NOSE
THE BACK WAS AN ADDRESS BOOK FILLED WITH NAMES--MANY CROSSED OUT
GORDON SAW TWO OF THE POLICE OFFICERS NEARBY FINGERING THEIR BADGES THOUGHTFULLY
SO I'M TURNING MY CHICKEN HOUSE OVER TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND I'M GOING HONEST
BUT HE CAN'T SAY IT
CRAZY TRENCH REPEATED
OKAY IZZY HE ADMITTED
TAKE THOSE TWO AND GIVE THEM SOME LESSONS WHILE I DO THE SAME WITH THESE FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
RUSTY SAT DOWN HIS LINED OLD FACE BREAKING INTO A FAINT GRIN
CRAZY GORDON GRIMACED FAINTLY
A MUNICIPAL CORPORAL AT THE TOP GRABBED FOR A WARNING WHISTLE BUT GORDON CLIPPED HIM WITH A HASTY RABBIT PUNCH AND SHOVED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS
THEN HE WISHED HE COULDN'T
FINALLY HE STOOD UP FROWNING
I SURE ASKED FOR THAT ONE
ONLY THEY GOT BETTER MEN ON IT THAN THEY WANTED
YOU FORGET THEM HERE AFTER A WHILE
DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS
MOTHER COREY MET HIM DRAGGING HIM BACK TO A SMALL ROOM WHERE HE DUG UP AN IMPOSSIBLY PRECIOUS BOTTLE OF BRANDY
THEY'VE GOT ME SEWED UP AND THEY'RE THROWING THE BOOK AT ME
GORDON SWUNG BACK AS HE PASSED THROUGH
THE TRUCKS PAID NO ATTENTION BUT BORE DOWN ON THE CROWD
WHEN SHE FINALLY ADMITS SHE NEEDS HER OLD GRANDFATHER GORDON WAS STARING BACK AT THE STRAGGLING OF TRUCKS HE COULD SEE BEGINNING TO BREAK AWAY
GORDON NEARLY DROPPED IT
YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR--OUTSIDE HE ANNOUNCED
MURDOCH'S CORPSE
WE'LL PROBABLY GET THIS MOTHER COREY AND ISAACS ELECTED PROPERLY
YOU DAMNED FIRSTER I'LL KILL YOU IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO
TRENCH TOOK FOREVER GIVING IT TO US MOTHER
CHAPTER VII ELECTIONEERING AS BRUCE GORDON CAME OUT FROM THE PRECINCT HOUSE HE NOTICED THE SOUNDS FIRST
NO DELIVERIES
IT HAD GOT HIM ONCE
I GOT A DUPLICATE KEY
GORDON REALIZED THAT THE GANG HAD FIGURED THAT CONCENTRATING THE POLICE HERE MEANT OTHER TERRITORIES WOULD BE SAFE
JUST A FRIEND ON THE WAY TO HIS OWN ROUTE
DOPE
AND STOP EXAMINING THE CARDS BRUCE
THE BANKS WERE OPEN AND DEPOSITS HONORED AS PROMISED
SEEING THE BIG SHIP READYING FOR TAKE-OFF BACK TO EARTH
HE STUDIED IT AGAIN THEN GOT UP AND DROPPED IT BESIDE HER
HE THREADED THROUGH THE MAZE OF THE LOCKERS WITH HIS KNIFE READY IN HIS HAND TRYING NOT TO ATTRACT SUSPICION
BUT HE PROTESTED AS GORDON TRIED TO STRIP THEM
GOT A DIFFERENT WAY HERE WE HAVE
IT SURPRISED HIM EVEN MORE WHEN HE SAW THAT A COUPLE OF THE MEN HAD COME OVER FROM HIS OLD BEAT
ON THE HOUSE COPPER FATS VOICE SAID
STOP HALFWAY AND THE HALLS ARE CLOSED TO YOU
AS A RESPECTABLE MAN NOW I COULDN'T HAVE STASHED YOU FROM THE COPS--THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEMPTED--MIGHTY TEMPTED HIS FACE WAS MELANCHOLY
HIS HAND DARTED OUT CLUTCHING IT
GOOD WORK--YOU TOO GORDON
SO WHEN WAYNE WAS STILL TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A PERFECT MARSPORT I JOINED UP
THERE WERE OCCASIONAL BUZZES OF ANGRY CONVERSATION THAT CUT OFF AS HE APPROACHED
THEN HE STOOD UP BLINKING HIS EYES UNTIL THEY COULD AGAIN MAKE OUT THE PATTERN OF THE DIM BULBS
HE VOTES ONE OF THE PLANTERS PASSED HIS GUN TO THE INSPECTOR FOR THE WAYNE SIDE
THEY'D HAD A HARD NIGHT AND
NEW SLOGANS AND NEW UNIFORMS AND NONE OF THEM MEAN ANYTHING
LET HIM THINK WE'RE JUST SCOUTING RANDOLPH ADVISED
A HUGE MAN OOZED OUT OF THE SHADOWS HIS GRAY FACE CONTORTING ITS DOUGHY FAT INTO A YELLOW-TOOTHED GRIN AND A FILTHY HAND WAVED BACK THE OTHERS
I'VE GOT TO GET INFORMATION TO TRENCH--AND IN PRIVATE THE CORPORAL STUTTERED
THIS IS ALL I HAVE LEFT
IS IT TRUE ABOUT SECURITY SENDING A SHIP SHE ASKED AT LAST
GORDON WHAT DOES SECURITY WANT WITH YOU SECURITY
I TAKE CARE OF THE SIDE THAT PAYS MY CUT AND THE BLOODY ADMINISTRATION PULLED THE PLUG ON MY BEAT TWICE
IZZY SLIPPED OVER AS HE BEGAN TO GET THEM ORGANIZED
BUT STEP OUT OF LINE AND I'LL HAVE YOU CLEANING STREETS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS
GORDON NODDED--IN A BRAWL SUCH AS THIS TWO WORKING TOGETHER HAD A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE
TAKE THESE TWO BACK TO YOUNG JURGENS BOYS AND TELL HIM TO KEEP HIS PUNKS OUT OF MY HOUSE THE ENTRANCE SNAPPED SHUT THEN AND COREY TURNED BACK TO GORDON WIPING THE WISPS OF HAIR FROM HIS FACE
NOR WILL THEY SUFFER FINANCIALLY FROM THE CHANGE
ISAACS
BUT YOU NEVER DUG UP NEWS THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE OR TELL THEM WHAT THEY DIDN'T SUSPECT ALL ALONG
THE MAN'S PALE BLONDNESS WEAK EYES AND GENERALLY RABBITY EXPRESSION TOTALLY BELIED THE COURAGE THAT HAD PERMITTED HIM TO KEEP GOING AT HIS HOPELESS TASK OF TRYING TO CLEAN UP MARSPORT
GORDON GRINNED WRYLY
TAKE ME COBBER
WE'LL DESTROY MARSPORT BEFORE WE'LL GIVE IN TO A DOPED-UP CROWD OF RIFFRAFF
THEY DROVE BACK THROUGH THE NIGHT AS RAPIDLY AS THE TRUCK COULD MANAGE
BUT YOU CAN DEDUCT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS HERE GORDON GOT OUT BEFORE HE LEARNED MORE GOOD NEWS
BUT TO SEE THE SORRY RESULTS OF IT LATER WAS ANOTHER
STRETCHING NORTH FROM THE GATE WERE THE MUNICIPALS WITH MEMBERS OF SOME OF THE GANGS
THE LEADING MOBSTER SAW THE CHANCE AND JUMPED FOR HIM
THEY HEAR A MAN CAN MAKE FIFTY CREDITS A DAY IN THE FACTORIES OR STRIKE IT RICH CROP PROSPECTING
ALL YOURS COBBER WHILE YOUR CRACKLE'S BLUE IT WAS A FILTHY DARK PLACE
THEN HIS GLANCE FELL ON THE ENTRANCE TO MOTHER COREY'S HOUSE--WITH SHEILA COREY COMING OUT OF THE SEAL
THE LEGALS BOUGHT RANDY'S CRUSADER
I'VE GOT A PROPOSITION STRAIGHT FROM WAYNE I'M LISTENING HERE TRENCH THREW ACROSS A PLATINUM BADGE
YOU THINK THEY GIVE AWAY AT THE HOSPITALS FREE SHE FELL TO HER KNEES CRYING OVER THE INJURED MAN
HIS KNEE CAUGHT THE OUTSIDE OF HER HIP AS SHE SPUN
HE SCREWED THE HELMET ON AND UNFASTENED HER ARMS
I CAN'T EVEN CABLE FOR FUNDS AND I GUESS I'M TOO OLD TO START SQUEEZING MONEY OUT OF CITIZENS
IZZY GRINNED AT HIS CONFUSION
HE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF HER AS HE STEPPED OUT A MINUTE LATER BUT THE BACK OF HIS NECK PRICKLED
WHERE DOES A MAN EAT AROUND HERE MOTHER COREY PRIED HIS EYES OFF THE CARDS AND RAN A THICK TONGUE OVER HEAVY LIPS
I'M GOING TO PUT THIS ON YOU AND THEN UNFASTEN YOUR ARMS AND LEGS
AS USUAL LESS THAN A HUNDRED CREDITS
IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
WE'RE BROKE
IT MADE SENSE
IT MADE SENSE
CHAPTER IX CONTRABAND ELECTIONS WERE OVER BUT THE FEW DIM LIGHTS ALONG THE STREET SHOWED ONLY BOARDED-UP AND DARKENED BUILDINGS
MEN WHO'D COME HERE WITH DREAMS AND STAYED WITHOUT THEM--THE SHOPKEEPERS WHO COULDN'T MEET THEIR GRAFT AND WERE HERE TO TRY TO WIN IT ON A LAST CHANCE
THE MAN DROPPED TO ANOTHER STOOL ROLLING DICE CASUALLY BETWEEN HIS THUMBS
THE OLDER MAN'S HANDS WENT OUT FOR THE GUN
BUT IT WAS THE SAME ALL ALONG THE STREET
RULE BOOKS
THERE WAS NO WAY TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF
ON YOU SHE BACKED AWAY BITING HER LIPS
MAYBE THEY'D KNOWN HOW HE FELT BETTER THAN HE HAD
THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT MADE NO MORE SENSE THAN ANY PART OF IT TO HIM BUT HE SAW THE MUNICIPALS AND LEGALS SUDDENLY BEGIN TO TURN AS A SINGLE MAN TO FACE THE OUTSIDE MENACE THAT HAD CREPT UP ON THEM WHILE THEY WERE BOILING INTO A FIGHT
WITH THEM AND THE KNIFE HE'D SELECTED HE MIGHT GET BY
EVERY COP'S REGISTERED IN HIS OWN PRECINCT
I'LL GET ALCOHOL FROM BELOW--AND BANDAGES AND HOT WATER ASA MURDOCH OPENED HIS EYES BREATHING STERTORIOUSLY
HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET TO SEE HELMETED MEN POURING OUT OF THE HOUSES AROUND AND OTHER MEN POURING FORWARD FROM HIS OWN GROUP
I'LL GET SOME TWINE TO TIE HER UP
HE DRAGGED THEM OUT BEFORE SNAPPING CUFFS ON THE MAN
WE GOT THE DOPE FROM OUR SOUTHERN RECEIVER
56-13313 PUBLISHED SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE DOMINION OF CANADA BY THE RYERSON PRESS TORONTO PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BY THE COLONIAL PRESS INC CLINTON MASSACHUSETTS CONTENTS I ONE WAY TICKET II HONEST IZZY III THE GRAFT IS GREEN IV CAPTAIN MURDOCH V RECALL VI SEALED LETTER VII ELECTIONEERING VIII VOTE EARLY AND OFTEN IX CONTRABAND X MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE XI THE SKY'S THE LIMIT XII WIFE OR PRISONER
THEN THE BEAT SWUNG OFF PAST A ROW OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND GENUINE ROOMING HOUSES BEFORE TURNING BACK TO THE MAIN SECTION
HE'D MADE HIS DECISION
THEY WERE NEAR THE BIG MUNICIPAL BUILDING WHEN THEY CAME TO THE FIRST REAL OPPOSITION AND IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HASTILY ASSEMBLED
DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D MET COBBERS
BIG ROOMS SIX-BY-TEN--FIFTY OF THEM BIG ENOUGH FOR WHOLE FAMILIES
BUT THE PUBLISHER MOTIONED HIM BACK AGAIN
GOT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS OUT THERE THAT EVEN WAYNE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HE STUCK OUT A HAND
IT STINKS
UNDER IT LAY A THIN METAL PLATE THAT GLOWED FAINTLY EVEN IN THE DIM LIGHT OF IZZY'S ROOM
HE FELT NUMBER BUT NO BETTER BY THE TIME IZZY CAME IN
NOT YET MOTHER
DAMN IT MOTHER SIT DOWN-WIND FROM ME WON'T YOU
USED THAT WITH A BIT OF MY OLD REPUTATION TO GET YOUR MAYOR GANNETT TO GIVE ME THE SAME FROM THE LEGALS
THE BUNTING IN FRONT OF THE BOOTHS WAS PULLED OFF AND THE LINES BEGAN TO MOVE
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE LIQUOR SHOP
YOU--YOU HE'D BEEN SEARCHING THE ROOM BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE NOTEBOOK THERE
GOOD GOD SERGEANT HE PLEADED LEAVE ME SOMETHING
HE DROPPED ONTO THE BED WEARILY THEN JERKED UPRIGHT AS SHE CAME OVER TO REMOVE HIS BOOTS
THEY'LL FIND OUT TOO MUCH EVENTUALLY HE PAUSED ESTIMATING GORDON
HE HIT THE ALLEY IN FIVE HEART-RIPPING LEAPS AND WAS AROUND THE BEND
HELLO GORDON
HE LEFT GENERAL CO-ORDINATION IN THE HANDS OF MOTHER COREY WHILE IZZY AND SCHULBERG RAN THE EXPANDING OF THE POLICE FORCE
HE DISREGARDED IT--AND THEN REALIZED IT WAS A MISTAKE
FIVE MINUTES MORE I THINK
THEY KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD WOULDN'T STAND FOR THE LANDING OF FOREIGN--THAT'S RIGHT FOREIGN_--TROOPS
AND DON'T GO BLAMING ME
WERE THEY WAITING FOR HIM TO GET UP ON A SOAPBOX
OR SHOULD I CARRY YOU MURDOCH SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE OVERTIME CONTINUED BUT IT WAS DULL AFTER THAT--WHICH MADE IT EVEN MORE TIRING
I SHOULD HAVE WATCHED HER
AND POLICE HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF THE BEATS THERE AFTER IT GREW UNSAFE EVEN FOR MEN IN PAIRS TO PATROL THE AREA
HE LOST STEADILY ON SMALL BETS FOR HALF AN HOUR ADMIRING THE SKILLED PALMING OF THE ODDS CUBES
WHY DIDN'T YOU TWO WAIT MOTHER COREY ASKED HIS VOICE BOOMING OUT OF HIS MARSPEAKER
I CAME OVER BECAUSE I WASN'T MUCH USE AT THE COOP AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS BUSY DOING WHAT GORDON ASKED
BEHIND SHEILA COREY LAY CRUMPLED IN A HEAP CLUTCHING ONE WRIST IN THE OTHER HAND AND CRYING SILENTLY
IDLY GORDON WONDERED WHAT KIND OF PRESSURES THE CAPTAINS WERE UNDER
IT WAS TERSE AND UNSIGNED
ISAACS CAN BRIEF YOU LATER
GORDON FOLLOWED HER UP THE STAIRS CARRYING MURDOCH ON HIS BACK
WE COULDN'T GET A CROOPSTER LOCKED UP TONIGHT FOR ANYTHING HE STARTED AHEAD LEADING THE WAY THROUGH THE REMAINING TRUCKS AND BACK TO THE STREET THAT LED TO MOTHER COREY'S
WE'VE GOT PERMISSION TO SEND YOU THERE IF YOU'LL GO
FAR UP A LEGAL COP WAS PASSING BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE SINGLE DIM LIGHT
HEART LIKE A STEEL TRAP COBBER HE SAID ALMOST APPROVINGLY
HER ROBE WAS PARTLY OPEN AND HUNGER BURNED IN HIM
IT'S NO HIDE-OUT LIKE THIS HE ROLLED THE MONEY IN HIS GREASY FINGERS
AND BRING OUT A STEAK THERE
AND IN ONE CORNER A COUPLE OF BLANKET SECTIONS FORMED A ROUGH SCREEN
AT LEAST HE LEFT FOR IT ACCORDING TO SHEILA GORDON PICKED UP SHEILA'S GUN AND BUCKLED IT ON BESIDE HIS OWN
BRUCE GORDON WAS SWORN IN AT ONCE
GORDON PICKED UP THE GUN THAT HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE HOLSTER AS THE MAN FELL AND PUT IT INTO HIS POUCH
AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO GO HUNTING FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE GANG
DON'T MATTER GOV'NOR
IT AIN'T HONEST AND I'M TOO SICK TO WORK
NOW HE LET HIS EYES RUN OVER THEM--THE NIGHT CITIZENS OF MARSPORT LOWER-DOME SECTION
SO GORDON ASKED
TRENCH JERKED HIS THUMB AND LEAPED TO HIS FEET RUSHING BACK
THE MUNICIPAL FORCES WERE RUSHING UP TOWARD THE DOME AND SURPRISED LEGALS WERE FRANTICALLY ARRIVING IN TRUCKS
GORDON SIDE-STEPPED AND CAUGHT ONE OF THE ARMS SWINGING THE HUGE BODY OVER ONE HIP
CAPTAIN TRENCH FOLLOWED HIM OUT AND BEGAN POINTING TOWARD THE GRAY CAR
GO TO BED
WHAT'S PUSHING STRANGER A YELLOW TICKET GORDON TOLD HIM AND A GOVERNMENT ALLOTMENT THAT'LL LAST ME TWO WEEKS IN THE DOME
THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE SIDE ENTRANCE TO SEVENTH PRECINCT HEADQUARTERS AND ONLY TWO CORPORALS ON DUTY INSIDE
COMMISSIONER TRENCH GORDON
BUT IF YOU START TO SO MUCH AS WIGGLE YOUR BIG TOE YOU WON'T SIT DOWN FOR A MONTH SHE PURSED HER LIPS HOTLY BUT MADE NO REPLY
HE CHECKED THE TINY BATTERIES THAT WERE RECHARGED BY GENERATORS IN THE SOLES OF THE BOOTS WITH EVERY STEP
THE PIKE WHISTLED OVER HIS HEAD BARELY MISSING AND HE WAS UP SQUASHING THE BIG STONE INTO THE FACE OF THE OTHER
THE MAN AT THE DESK WENT INTO AN OFFICE MARKED PRIVATE AND CAME BACK A FEW MINUTES LATER
THEY PAID ME TO STALL YOU SO I DID
MOTHER COREY PUT A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE INTO HIS HANDS
AND WHAT HAPPENED HE INDICATED THE BARE SLEEVE
I'D BE DEAD IF YOU WEREN'T I GUESS GORDON MADE NO COMMENT AND TRENCH SAID I COULD START A NASTY INVESTIGATION I GUESS
IZZY WAS MORE BUSINESSLIKE
THE OTHER GANGMEN WERE WITH THE LEGALS TO THE SOUTH
BUT NOW SHE JERKED TO HER FEET HER HAND GOING BACK AND FORWARD
JURGENS PUNKS EH THANKS FOR COMING
NEEDLED CHAPTER VI SEALED LETTER IN THE FEW DAYS AT THE SHORT-LIVED NINETEENTH PRECINCT BRUCE GORDON HAD BEGUN TO FEEL LIKE A COP AGAIN BUT THE FEELING DISAPPEARED AS HE REPORTED IN AT CAPTAIN ISAIAH TRENCH'S SEVENTH PRECINCT
IT TAKES AT LEAST NINE HONEST MEN TO SUPPORT A CROOK
THEN THE SECOND WENT UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME DOWN IN THE NEWCOMER'S HANDS TO LAND WITH A SICKENING JAR AND LIE STILL
GORDON DID HE TRY TO MAKE YOU THINK HE WAS SECURITY GORDON FILLED IN
GETTING THAT FIGHT STARTED IN TIME AFTER YOU FIRST SHOWED UP--OH SURE WE SPOTTED YOU--WAS THE TOUGHEST JOB I EVER DID
JURGENS REACHED OUT FOR TOBACCO AND FILLED A PIPE
FINE VIEW OF THE PARADES
I COULDN'T CONTROL MYSELF AT HER AGE COULDN'T CONTROL MY SON AND I DON'T INTEND TO HANDLE A FEMALE OF MY LINE
IF THE GEES IN THE WAGON CLEAN HIM OR THE DESK MAN GETS IT THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS
HE'S DEAD ALL RIGHT
I THOUGHT TWO OTHER GEES WON THE LOTTERY SO THE PROMOTION HAD COME FROM TRENCH
WE'D BETTER SHIFT TO ANOTHER TERRITORY MURDOCH DECIDED
MAYBE I COULD TRY IT THOUGH FORGET IT GORDON TOLD HIM
SHE OPENED A DOOR PASSED THROUGH A TINY KITCHEN AND THREW OPEN ANOTHER DOOR TO A BEDROOM
THEY'LL TAKE THE PLANET AWAY FROM EARTH YET RANDOLPH AGREED
IT WOULDN'T DO HIS RECORD ANY GOOD WITH TRENCH BUT IT SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE OVERTIME
AND YOU WON'T FIND IT SO DON'T BOTHER LOOKING SHE WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR
THIS WILL IDENTIFY THE BEARER BRUCE IRVING GORDON AS A PRIME AGENT OF THE OFFICE OF SOLAR SECURITY EMPOWERED TO MAKE AND EXECUTE ANY AND ALL DIRECTIVES UNDER THE POWERS OF THIS OFFICE THE PRINTING IN CAPITALS WAS OBVIOUSLY DONE BY HAND BUT WITH THE SAME CATALYTIC INK AS THE REST OF THE BADGE
IT SWUNG UP AND HE SAW A POCK-MARKED FACE THAT WAS TWISTED IN A SMILE MEANT TO BE INGRATIATING
IZZY I HAVE A FEELING WE SHOULD LET THEM SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES AS THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND THEM GORDON YANKED SHEILA BACK TO THE COUCH
BUT HE WAS STRONGER
HE BENT DOWN FORCING HER HEAD BACK AND SETTING HIS LIPS ON HERS
THEN HE GRINNED AND WAVED HIS VISITOR FORWARD
TWO GALLONS THERE ARE HEAT TABLETS AND A SKIN TUB THE SALESGIRL HAD EXPLAINED HOW ONE GALLON WAS ENOUGH IN THE PLASTIC BAG THAT SERVED AS A TUB
AFTER THAT THE WATCHERS BEGAN TO MELT AWAY
IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON OBVIOUSLY
THEY HAD SECRETLY TRADED A SUPPLY TO WAYNE WHO HAD BECOME AN ADDICT FOR A STOCK OF WEAPONS
EVEN WHERE HE STOOD GORDON COULD SMELL THE FUMES OF AMMONIA
AND MAYBE WINNING
THE THIRD DROPPED WITHOUT FIRING AND THE FOURTH'S SHOT WENT WILD
WATCHING THE OPERATION WAS JURGENS
COREY SNAPPED OUT A QUICK WORD AND THE TWO GUARDS CEASED STRUGGLING AND STARTED BACK ACROSS THE STREET
AND HAVING FIREARMS INSIDE IT--EXCEPT FOR A FEW CHOSEN MEN--WAS A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY DEATH
HEY MOTHER BRUCE GORDON DIDN'T ASK HOW MOTHER COREY HAD ACQUIRED THE DOPE
JUST MISSED YOU AT THE PRECINCT HOUSE CAME AFTER YOU AND SAW YOU TURN IN HERE
FIRST ACE DEALS
HE'D THOUGHT HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH HUMAN MISERY FROM HIS OWN EARTH SLUM BACKGROUND
SHE LET OUT A SCREAM AS HE SAW HER MOMENTUM CARRY HER OVER HIM
HE FELT THE CURIOUS EYES OF MOTHER COREY DANCING FROM HIM TO IZZY AND BACK AND HEARD THE OLD MAN'S CHUCKLE
TEN MEN THE DRIVER--AND BRUCE GORDON
IN THE FEW DIM LIGHTS THE OLD BUILDING STILL GAVE OFF AN AIR OF MOLD AND DECAY
THE SACRED DOME
THIS WAS MARS
BRUCE GORDON LOOKED AT THE DEBACLE LEFT BEHIND THE DRUNKEN LOOTING MOB
UNLESS TRENCH HAD SHOWN THE BADGE TO OTHERS HIS PROBLEM BOILED DOWN TO A SINGLE MAN
IT'S JUST AS TRUE OUT HERE AS IT IS ON THE FRONTIER
FORGET THAT PART
HE SLUMPED ONTO THE FLOOR AND BEGAN TO TRY HITCHING HIS WAY DOWN THE STEPS
HE WAS A BIG OPEN-FACED MAN JUST TURNING BALD
GORDON HEARD A SIGH FROM BESIDE HIM
HE STARTED TO THROW IT AWAY AND THEN LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS
BRUCE GORDON HAD NOW MANAGED TO MAKE A FULL CIRCLE BACK TO HIS BEGINNINGS ON MARS
GORDON GATHERED THE TWO HOODLUMS UNDER HIS ARMS AND DRAGGED THEM WITH HIM
IF THE DOME GIVES THEM A PERFECT COVER WHY LET ME MAKE A JACKASS OF MYSELF MOTHER HE ASKED NUMBLY
MOTHER COREY'S WORDS ABOUT HIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE CAME BACK
BUT NEITHER DO THEY
MURDOCH HAD FIXED IT SO HE'D BE A SQUAD LEADER AND THAT MEANT HE'D BE UNABLE TO STEP OUT OF LINE
SHE HESITATED FOR A SECOND BIT HER LIPS AND FINALLY MOVED OUT INTO THE CROWD
EARTH HAD CUT OFF ALL SHIPPING UNTIL THE AFFAIR WAS SETTLED AND NOBODY IN THE OUTLANDS WOULD DEAL IN SCRIP
HE CAME OVER NODDED PICKED UP A CUP AND DICE AND BEGAN SHAKING THEM
THEN HE LET OUT A SUDDEN YELP OF LAUGHTER
WE GOTTA CONVOY THESE PEOPLE THEY WERE FOLLOWING A KIND OF ROAD WHEN HEADLIGHTS BORE DOWN ON THEM
SO ROMANTIC SHE SIGHED
IT WENT AT AN ANGLE AND WOULD OFFER SOME PROTECTION
ONE OF THEM WAS OBVIOUSLY IZZY WEARING THE SAME GREEN AS THE OTHERS
WHEN A MAN CAN'T GET THE NAME STRAIGHT THE FIRST TIME IT'S SUSPICIOUS THE SUPPOSEDLY NEUTRAL CHECKER NODDED
GORDON STRAIGHTENED FROM HIS AWKWARD POSITION DRAWING HIS FOOT BACK AND REACHED OUT FOR THE PILE OF CHIPS
SHE SWUNG WITH A SINGLE GASP AND HER HAND DARTED DOWN FOR HER KNIFE SWEEPING IT UP AND TOWARD HIM
GET YOU IN A COP'S OUTFIT AND YOU'LL TURN HONEST
THE FELLOW'S EYES WERE DESPERATE BUT HE WAS FORCING HIMSELF TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
YOUR FRIENDS DID THAT
WE GOT THEM ALL PIE-FACE HER VOICE WAS DOUBTFUL
IZZY YOU TELL HIM HE GRABBED GORDON'S HAND AND WADDLED DOWN THE LANDING PLANK
LIFTING THE ROLL OF ANYONE OUTSIDE THE ENFORCED PART OF MARS LAWS WAS APPARENTLY HONEST IN HIS EYES
HE FOUND THE APELIKE BODYGUARD STRETCHED OUT ON A BUNK A VACANT SMILE ON HIS FACE
THEN IT WAS GOOD TO RELAX WHILE TRENCH DROVE ALONG THE RUBBLE-PILED AND NEARLY DESERTED STREETS
THEN HE WENT ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO A SPUR OF THE LITTLE ELECTRIC MONORAIL SYSTEM WITH THREE ABANDONED SERVICE ENGINES PARKED AT THE END
HE PICKED UP THE CARDS
JURGENS DON'T WANT YOU
NOW SHE GRABBED AT HER HELPERS AND SWUNG THEM WITH HER
WE'LL CONFIRM OFFICIALLY OF COURSE IN THE APPLICATIONS SECTION OF THE BIG MUNICIPAL BUILDING AT THE CENTER OF THE DOME THERE WAS A LONG FORM TO FILL OUT AT THE DESK
GORDON WENT TO THE LITTLE SPACE--AND SAW THAT IZZY WAS RIGHT
HE TIGHTENED HIS HAND AND LIFTED HER TO THE BED DROPPING A KNEE ONTO HER THROAT AND BEGINNING TO SQUEEZE WHILE HE JERKED THE DRESS AND THIN SLIP OFF
ANOTHER FOUR DAYS PASSED AFTER THEY HAD SENT HIM BACK TO WAIT UNTIL THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS FOR HIM
THEY WENT THROUGH AND HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO LOCATE A BROKEN-DOWN TRICYCLE CAB
I KNEW YOU HAD THIS CANNON GOV'NOR AND I FIGURED IT'D COME IN HANDY
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T IN TOP SHAPE SO I FIGURED A CONVOY MIGHT BE HANDY
SHEILA WAS STANDING OVER HIM WHEN HE FINALLY WOKE
A DULL WEIGHT HIT THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND HE FELT HIMSELF FALLING
HE SAW THE LEGAL COP MOVE OUT OF SIGHT AND STEPPED ONTO THE STREET TRYING TO LOOK LIKE ANOTHER PETTY CROOK ON THE PROWL
IT WAS A THIN KID OF PERHAPS EIGHTEEN BEHIND HIM CARRYING A TORCH THAT WAS FILTERED TO BARE VISIBILITY
BUT THERE WAS NO MOCKERY ON HER FACE--AND ODDLY IT FELT GOOD TO HIM
OUT AT THE SPACEPORT SHIPS WERE DROPPING DOWN FROM DEIMOS WITH THE SUPPLIES THAT HAD BEEN HELD UP SO LONG AND A LONG LINE OF TRUCKS WENT SNAKING BY
AND YOU AREN'T A COWARD AS MOST OF THESE FAT FOOLS ARE
YOU OPEN UP GORDON WAS ALREADY MOVING UP THE STAIRS WHEN A SECOND VOICE REACHED HIM AND THIS ONE WAS FAMILIAR
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW I RUINED THE DOME WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE KILLED MURDOCH PRETENDED I WAS A SECURITY AGENT YOU WERE ONE THE MAN SAID
TRENCH SHRUGGED
FROM THE BROKEN MATTRESS ON THE BED HE DUG OUT A COIL OF WIRE AND BOUND HER HANDS AND FEET WITH IT
SHE WAS AT THE EDGE OF THE RAIL AND STARTING TO FALL
AND NO KICKBACKS EITHER GORDON PICKED UP THE BADGE SLOWLY AND BUCKLED IT ON WHILE A GRIM SATISFIED SMILE SPREAD OVER TRENCH'S FEATURES
IT WAS A PERIOD OF COMPLETE FOG TO HIM BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL HIS MOTLEY ARMY REACHED THE DOME STRAGGLING UP IN TRUCKS AND ON FOOT THAT HE SNAPPED INTO FOCUS AGAIN
COREY SHOOK HIS HEAD SETTING THE HEAVY FOLDS OF FLESH TO BOUNCING
TRENCH HAD TRICKED HIM
SHREDS FOR THE FOUR YEARS AS A KID IN THE RING BEFORE THAT--HE'D NEVER MADE THE TOP
AS I WAS GOING TO SAY COBBER HE SAID WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SOCIAL GAME GOING UPSTAIRS--THE ROOM WITH THE WINDOW
THIS TIME THERE WAS NO SCATTERING OF MUNICIPALS AND LEGALS
THE WHOLE THING HINGED ON TRENCH
SENILE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME IZZY SAID
YOU'RE HEAD OF SECURITY ON MARS NOW
HE CONSIDERED THE TWO AND DECIDED THEY WOULD BE NO MENACE
THEN HE WAS ON HIS OWN AGAIN
HE LIFTED HIS FOOT TO PUT IT BACK DOWN TO A LOWER STEP JUST AS SHEILA'S MUFFLED VOICE SHRILLED OUT A FOG OF PROFANITY
HE WASN'T SO SURE ABOUT SHEILA
TWENTY-ONE WINS AGAIN HE PUSHED CHIPS TOWARD GORDON AS IF EVERY ONE OF THEM CAME OUT OF HIS OWN PAY
GORDON HAD NO TIME TO CONSIDER HIS SUDDEN TRAITOR-ALLY
GORDON SLIPPED BACK BEHIND ANOTHER TRUCK LISTENING FOR THE SOUND OF THEIR FEET
HER HANDS TREMBLED AS SHE RELOCKED THE SEAL
SEE IT
AFTERWARDS PROMISES GREW DIM
THE LITTLE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS ANCIENT EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD FACE TURNING SOBER
IT WAS A BEAUTIFULLY TIMED SURPRISE ATTACK AND A WELL-ARMED ONE EVEN THOUGH GUNS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SO RARE HERE
THE ENTRANCE WAS IN NEARLY COMPLETE DARKNESS
HIS HANDS DROPPED TO THE HANDCUFFED MAN ON THE FLOOR AND HE CAUGHT HIM UP WITH A JERK SLAPPING HIS BODY BACK AGAINST THE COUNTER
I DO THAT
A SKILLED MAN COULD KNOCK A KNIFE OR EVEN A HEAVY CLUB OUT OF ANOTHER'S HAND WITH A SINGLE FLICK OF THE WRIST
HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED DOWN
THEY'RE MARTIANS
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT SECURITY
SO ONE OF YOUR SECURITY BADGES HAD THE WRONG MAN ATTACHED TO IT AND WORD GOT BACK
TWO OTHER MEN STOOD BEHIND GORDON WHILE JURGENS EXPLAINED THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE BEING INTERRUPTED ON BUSINESS CALLS ABOUT THE MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN OR ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT NEXT TIME THERE'D BE REAL HARD FEELINGS
BUT THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE HAD BEEN WRONG
WE NEED MEN LIKE YOU
AND WE GIVE A HALF EXTRA RATION TO THE GUYS WHO CAN FIND ANYTHING USEFUL TO DO
GET THE DOME
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BUSY MURDOCH ANNOUNCED SHORTLY IN THE DILAPIDATED BUILDING THAT HAD BEEN HASTILY CONVERTED TO A PRECINCT HOUSE
SETTING IN A CHAIR ALL DAY BEING AN HONEST CITIZEN
BUT SOMEHOW THEY DID CLEAN UP VENUS
COP CAUGHT HIM PEDDLING ONE OF RANDOLPH'S PAMPHLETS CUT OUT PART OF HIS TONGUE
HE FELT SICK AS HE STOOD UP TO FIND PAPER AND PEN AND WRITE A TERSE FACTUAL ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN PERSONAL DOINGS--MINUS ANY HINT OF ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM HERE
THE FEW CITIZENS ON THE STREET WHO DRIFTED TOWARD THE TRUCK TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THEM AND MOVED ON HASTILY
SHE FELL OVER DROPPING THE GUN
THE MOB HAD DECIDED THAT THEY HAD MINED AND EXPLODED THE DOME
GOOD WORK GOV'NOR THE KID'S THIN VOICE APPROVED AND GORDON SWUNG TO SEE THE OTHER GETTING UP PAINFULLY
I'D LIKE QUITE ALL RIGHT GORDON THE CAPTAIN BOOMED
BUT I GUESS SINCE TRENCH BROUGHT YOU BACK YOU'VE COOLED
HE WAS STILL IN A BROWN STUDY AS HE TOOK THE BUNDLES FROM IZZY AND DROPPED THEM ON HIS BED
HE HASN'T SEEN IT YET I GUESS
HE DREW IT OUT SCOWLING AT IT AND STARTED TO CRUMPLE IT
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND TRIED TO INDICATE IT
THE ONLY STRENGTH SECURITY'S EVER HAD COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT ALWAYS WINS SOMEHOW
AND IT CAN'T DO IT
BUT GOD HELP US GOV'NOR IF ANY GEE SPOTS US THEY WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT WHILE RUSTY WENT BACK TO REQUISITION MORE EXPLOSIVES FROM THE DWINDLING SUPPLY AND WHILE THE KID AND IZZY TOOK TIME OFF TO BREAK INTO A CLOSED CONVERTER PLANT AND FIND WIRE ENOUGH TO CONNECT THE CHARGES
SEE WHAT OUTER MARSPORT IS LIKE
I GUESS THAT'S ALL BOYS
AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO--ACCORDING TO THEM
GETTING OFF THE DRIVER SHRUGGED HIS HAND AWAY
GET ME TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK--AND BE DAMNED TO THIS
MURDOCH HAD DONE BETTER THAN GORDON HAD SUSPECTED
A HEAVY HAND FELL ON HIS SHOULDER AND HE TURNED TO SEE MOTHER COREY
AND YOU'LL SEE THINGS HUM SOON GORDON HAD VOTED THREE TIMES UNDER THE HONOR SYSTEM BEFORE HE SAW
GORDON BEGAN TO WONDER HOW IT COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A CLEAR UNANIMOUS VOTE AT THAT RATE
AND FINALLY THE UGLY HALF-CYLINDER OF PATCHED BRICK AND METAL THAT WAS THE OLD MOTHER COREY'S CHICKEN COOP SHOWED UP AGAINST THE FAINT LIGHT
DO YOU STILL THINK I HAVE IT ON ME HE GRINNED TWISTING THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH
NOBODY HAD TO GUESS THAT HE'D NEVER PAY IT BACK SO GORDON FOUND IZZY ORGANIZING THE BOUNCERS FROM THE JOINTS AND SOME OF THE CITIZENS INTO A SQUAD
THEY'D BEEN WRONG
BULLETS FROM A SUBMACHINE GUN CLIPPED OUT PEPPERING THE ENTRANCE AND THE DOOR AND RICOCHETING DOWN THE HALL
MEN WERE COMING FROM THE FEW BUS ROUTES LUGGING TOOLS AND LUNCH BASKETS SLUMPED AND BEATEN FROM LABOR IN THE ATOMIC PLANTS THE MARTIAN CONVERSION FARMS AND THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAD COME INEVITABLY WHERE INEFFICIENCY WAS BETTER THAN THE HIGH PRICES OF IMPORTS
MOTHER COREY SIGHED AGAIN
THERE WERE NO WINDOWS HERE AND HIS OWN ROOM HAD AN EXCELLENT LOCK ON IT ALREADY--ONE HE'D PUT ON HIMSELF
WE'RE STILL SHORT ON ELECTION FUNDS SO THERE'S A RAFFLE
THE WEBBING STRAPS BROKE AND THE DOME JERKED UPWARDS TWISTING OUTWARDS AND THEN FALLING INTO RIBBONS
INSIDE THE DOME
MOTHER COREY KNEW THE ROPES AND COULD BE TRUSTED
OKAY PROBABLY ROUTINE
INSIDE MOONEY'S HE HEADED QUICKLY FOR THE DICE TABLE
YOU WON'T FIND PRAEGER ON HIS FARM--COULDN'T REACH IT IN THAT ANYHOW HE SAID FINALLY
I GOT SOME PICS OF TRENCH FROM A GUY I KNOW
HOPE THEY'VE GOT A FEW CHEAP PUSHERS AROUND THAT DON'T PAY PROTECTION DIRECT TO THE CAPTAIN
THE SURPRISE RAID BY THE STAR POINTERS HADN'T BEEN QUITE AS MUCH OF A SURPRISE AS EXPECTED
GO AHEAD AND TELL ME I'M THE SAME AS YOUR FIRST HUSBAND
RED HAIR TOO HEAVILY BUILT A LIGHTER SECTION WHERE A MUSTACHE HAD BEEN SHAVED AND THE SKIN NOT QUITE PERFECTLY POWDERED
I DON'T CHEAT MY FRIENDS
EVEN IN MARS GRAVITY HIS BULK MADE THE OTHER BUCKLE AT THE KNEES
THIS IS A RESCUE
I'M FROM THE AJAX HOUSEHOLDERS PROTECTION GROUP THE DARK MAN ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY
AND THEY STOOD WITHIN INCHES OF THE DOME HOLDING AXES AND KNIVES
IT AIN'T HONEST GOV'NOR
HE RAN HIS HANDS OVER HER LOOKING FOR A HIDING PLACE FOR MORE MONEY
THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN THE CHIPS THAT'S MARS GORDON ECHOED THE OTHER'S COMMENT
I'VE READ THE STUFF YOU WROTE
ANY MAN WHO DESERTS WILL BE CONSIDERED A TRAITOR
IT WAS NEAR THE END OF HIS SHIFT JUST AS DARKNESS WAS FALLING AND THE FEW LIGHTS WERE GOING ON
HE COULD HAVE TOLD TRENCH THAT THE FUND WAS GOOD-ENOUGH REASON FOR MOST POLICE DESERTING
ONE MIGHT BE TURNED ON ITS OWNER AND A SLIT SUIT MEANT DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION
GORDON RISKED A QUICK LOOK THEN STEPPED FARTHER OUT TO MAKE SURE
THE SUPPLY HOUSE EARTHSIDE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT THIS PATTERN HAD NEVER BEEN EXPORTED TO MARS
NOT TO ME IZZY
GORDON WAS MOVING CAUTIOUSLY USING HIS HELMET LIGHT ONLY OCCASIONALLY GUN READY IN HIS HAND
ONE HIT THE BIG GRAY CAR TOSSING IT ASIDE
AT DOUBLE STANDARD PAY WITH NORMAL MARS EXPENSES HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PAY FOR PASSAGE BACK TO EARTH IN THREE YEARS--IF SECURITY LET HIM
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
ONE OF THE HOODS DROPPED HIS CLUB IN DUCKING
SO WE FIGURED WHEN WE FOUND THE STIFFS MAYBE YOU'D COME BACK MOTHER
BRUCE GORDON LOOKED AND SPOTTED THE RAGGED BUILDING HALF A MILE OUTSIDE THE DOME
NOW SHOW ME WHERE I SIGNED ANY AGREEMENT SAYING I'D PAY YOU BACK FOR A SECOND IZZY'S FACE WENT BLANK
IT LAY THROUGH THE SECTION WHERE GORDON HAD FIRST TRIED HIS LUCK ON MARS
HE REACHED AUTOMATICALLY FOR THE GLASS OF ETHER-NEEDLED BEER
MOSTLY
I'M LOOKING FOR MOTHER COREY THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM COBBER
THE OLD LAWS MAKE ME A CITIZEN WHILE I WEAR THE UNIFORM--AND A CITIZEN CAN'T QUIT THE FORCE
SPENT FOUR WEEKS DOWN THERE
WATER
SOMETHING BEGAN TO BURN INSIDE HIM BUT HE HELD HIMSELF IN CONFINING HIS TALK TO VAGUE COMMENTS ON THE RUMORS GOING AROUND
IZZY HELD OUT A HAND TO GORDON
HE'D BOUGHT A SUIT OF AIRTIGHT COVERALLS AND A HELMET AT THE FIELD
YOU WON'T REGRET IT GORDON STARTED TO TURN
YOU OKAY HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN LIKE THIS FIFTEEN HOURS I GUESS
IT WAS THE FAINTEST SWISH IN THE AIR THAT CAUGHT HIS EAR
MURDOCH BUNCHED THEM TOGETHER
BULLETS SPATTED AGAINST THE WALLS AND HE SAW BLOOD PUMPING FROM UNDER MURDOCH'S RIGHT SHOULDER
SHOW YOUR PAPERS AND GO INTO ANY BOOTH IN YOUR TERRITORY
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU BUT YOU WON THE LOTTERY
SHE DROPPED A HAND ONTO HIS NODDING
KILL HIM THIS TIME HE DIDN'T WAIT TO BE ATTACKED
FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I'M GOING TO MISS HAVING YOU AROUND HE STOOD UP
THE IRON-GRAY HAIR CAUGHT HIS EYES FIRST
IZZY HAD CO-OPERATED--RELUCTANTLY UNTIL GORDON WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT IT WAS THE PEOPLE WHO PAID HIS SALARY
BETTER MAKE IT MORE THAN GABLE TURNED IN IF YOU WANT TO GET A BETTER BEAT THE ENVELOPES WERE LYING ON A TABLE MARKED VOLUNTARY DONATIONS
IT WAS HUGE
BUT THE MUGGERS HAD APPARENTLY GIVEN UP BEFORE IZZY AND GORDON ARRIVED SINCE THE MAN HAD HIS WALLET CLUTCHED IN HIS HAND
BUT THE FALL HADN'T BEEN ENOUGH TO DO SERIOUS DAMAGE
HE FELT A BODY UNDER HIM AND COLDNESS WASHED OVER HIM BEFORE HE COULD GET HIS EYES DOWN
SECURITY HAS TO BE NOTIFIED
WHYN'T YOU SAY HE WAS WITH MURDOCH THEY WANT SOMEONE TO LOCATE ED PRAEGER AND SEE ABOUT GETTING SOME FOOD SHIPPED IN FROM OUTSIDE COBBER MOTHER COREY TOLD HIM
LET'S GET A BEER GOV'NOR--ON ME IT WAS AS GOOD AN IDEA AS ANY HE HAD GORDON DECIDED
FOUR KNIVES STOOD BURIED IN THE GROUND AT GORDON'S FEET FORMING A SQUARE--AND A FIFTH WAS IN THE KID'S HAND
NOBODY KNEW I WAS HERE--TRENCH WAS OUR MAN--SOLD US OUT
BUT THEY HAD RECENTLY DECLARED WAR ON THE COPS
REMEMBER YOU WITH MURDOCH ANYHOW
TRENCH HOWEVER HAD OTHER IDEAS
WELL WE DON'T HAVE AN ARMY
HE BARELY CAUGHT THE WRIST COMING TOWARD HIM
THEY CAME ON A DRUNK LATER COLLAPSED IN AN ALLEY
ALL THE POLICE GEES GET TOMORROW OFF--YOU TOO GOV'NOR
THE DOORS OF THE BANK WERE LOCKED SHUT BUT MEN WERE ATTACKING IT WITH AN IMPROVISED BATTERING RAM
HIS THOUGHTS WERE CHURNING SO BUSILY THAT HE DIDN'T SEE THE BLONDE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD FORCED HER WAY PAST THEM ON THE STAIRS
IT WAS EXACTLY TEN DAYS LATER
HAD BREAKFAST GORDON GORDON SHOOK HIS HEAD AND REALIZED SUDDENLY THAT THE DECISION SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS HANDS
IT LED TO SOME RELAXATION BETWEEN THEM AND THEY BEGAN TALKING IMPERSONALLY
THEN THE KID DROPPED BEHIND HIM FIGHTING BACK-TO-BACK
SCHULBERG FOUND A SCRAP OF SOMETHING AND PENCILED THE CRIME ON IT TOGETHER WITH A CIRCLE SIGNATURE AND PINNED IT TO THE BODY
THEY MUST BE COUNTING ON OUR ORIGINAL TIME SO THEY'RE IN NO HURRY TO REMOVE THE POWDER AND WIRING
THEN A SMALL TRUCK DREW UP AND AN ARM WENT OUT TO DRAW HIM INSIDE THE CAB
SHE FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE CREAKING STAIRS AND TO THE ROOM WHERE SCHULBERG MOTHER COREY AND A FEW OTHERS WERE STILL ARGUING SOME DETAIL
EARTH'S SENDING A FLEET--GOT OFFICIAL WORD OF IT
LIGHTS BOBBED ABOUT--POLICE IN PAIRS PATROLLING IN THE BETTER STREETS WALKING AS FAR FROM THE HOUSES AS THEY COULD
THE MAN WAS TOTALLY UNLIKE A MARTIAN CAPTAIN AND A KNOT OF HOMESICKNESS FOR EARTH RAN THROUGH HIS STOMACH
HE MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY WHAT LIFE HE STILL HAD WHILE HE COULD
THAT FILLS MY QUOTA
NAME YOUR OWN SALARY ONCE YOU'VE DONE THE JOB
GORDON NODDED MENTALLY CATALOGUING THE DRUMMER AS THE COCKROACH TYPE MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SMALL-BUSINESSMAN SLUG AND THE PETTY-CROOK SPIDER TYPES THAT WEREN'T WORTH BOTHERING WITH
BUT THEY WERE MET EVERYWHERE BY SULLEN FACES
THEN HE STOPPED STARING AT THE PIECE OF IMITATION LEATHER AND PAPER THAT WOULDN'T BEND
FREITAG WHAT ABOUT YOU
IF THEY WON'T LET US GET THE OIL AND CHEMICALS WE NEED WHY SHOULD WE FEED THEM EVER SEE STARVATION GORDON ASKED WISHING AGAIN SOMEONE ELSE WHO'D FELT IT COULD CARRY THE MESSAGE
MEN IN THE MUNICIPAL UNIFORM WERE WORKING OVER THE SMALL JOB PRESS AND DUMPING THE HAND-SET TYPE FROM THE BOXES
BEYOND LAY A LIGHTED STREET AND A SIGN THAT ANNOUNCED MOONEY'S AMUSEMENT PALACE--DRINKS FREE TO PATRONS HE LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET THEN WALKED BRISKLY TOWARD THE SOMEWHAT PLUSHER GAMBLING HALL THERE
IT SAILED OVER THE BROKEN RAILING TO LAND ON THE FLOOR BELOW AND CRASH THROUGH THE ROTTEN PLANKING
I'VE HEARD THE THEORY BUT NEVER SAW IT IN PRACTICE
BUT WHAT STARTED IT RUMORS THAT MAYOR WAYNE GOT A BIG LOAN FROM THE BANK--AND WHY NOT SEEING IT WAS HIS BANK
HE TRIED TO MOVE BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
AND THERE'S HELL BREWING ON MERCURY--WORSE THAN HERE
HE TREATED ME RIGHT AND I TOOK ORDERS
AND THEN THE BOYS WITH ME WILL BE MARKS FOR THE GANG WHEN IT COMES BACK
BUT IZZY WAS ALREADY GONE
THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A SHOT AND A HORRIFIED CRY
HE TURNED THE ROOM UPSIDE DOWN BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE NOTEBOOK OR PAPERS FROM IT
GONNA BUY ME A JOB AS A COP
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
THEN A HEAVY BELLOW SOUNDED AND A SEEMING MOUNTAIN OF FLESH THUNDERED ACROSS THE HUGE ROOM
WHILE HE STARED SHEILA CAME OUT FINISHING THE ZIPPING OF HER AIRSUIT
GORDON'S MONEY HAD CARRIED MORE WEIGHT THAN HIS BROTHER'S REPUTATION
AND YOU'D BETTER BE READY TO OPEN WHEN I COME BACK HE WAS IN COMPARATIVE DARKNESS ALMOST AT ONCE AND TONIGHT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE LIGHTS OF PATROLLING COPS
BUT I'D RATHER YOU KEPT HER HERE IF YOU'LL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY
BUT THE CAPTAIN THERE HAD ALREADY HAD ANSWERS TYPED IN
WANT A ROOM GORDON GRINNED AND NODDED
AND REPORT IN EIGHT TOMORROW MORNING IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT
BUT ANY MAN WHO STICKS WILL BE REWARDED MORE THAN HE EVER EXPECTED
AND THIS LATEST TRICK FOLDED UP TOO
DON'T DO IT COBBER
FATS WATCHED HIM DOURLY THEN SWUNG ON HIS HEEL JUST AS A SHRILL STRANGLED CRY WENT UP FROM SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
IT AIN'T RIGHT GOV'NOR LET HIM DO WHAT HE DAMN PLEASES GORDON TOLD HIM
HE'D REFUSED TO TAKE A DIVE AS A BOXER
AND TO EAT WE'LL GO ON DOING WHAT WE'RE TOLD CHAPTER XIV FULL CIRCLE HENDRIX HAD BEEN WOUNDED LIGHTLY AND WAS OUT WHEN GORDON AND IZZY REPORTED
BUT HE'D AT LEAST BE A CHANGE AND CERTAINLY THE CITIZENS WERE ACHING FOR THAT
BRUCE GORDON WAS TRAPPED
OBJECT LESSON THE ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE CAPTAIN GORDON DECIDED WAS THAT HE BELIEVED IN DOING HIS OWN DIRTIEST WORK
THE BLONDE YOU SHOOK DOWN
A YELL FROM THE BASEMENT CALLED HIM BACK DOWN TO WHERE IZZY WAS BUSILY GOING THROUGH PILES OF CRATES AND BOXES STACKED ALONG ONE WALL
IZZY COULD ONLY HAVE MEANT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HOLE UP IN MOTHER COREY'S OLD CHICKEN COOP
SHEILA OPENED HER EYES AT HIS UNIFORM BUT MADE NO COMMENT
WHAT DOES YOUR BOSS JURGENS FIGURE ON DOING PUNK
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU COULD STAND IT--AND FATS DON'T FORGET OLD FRIENDS FRIENDS AND OTHER THINGS GORDON SAID REMEMBERING HIS FIRST VISIT HERE
HE FOUND HIS POLICE CLUB CHECKED THE LOOP AT ITS END AND SLIPPED IT ONTO HIS WRIST
THEN SHE BRUSHED THE THIN HAIR OFF HER FACE AND POINTED
THE GANG HAD BEGUN TO BREAK UP BUT THE NUCLEUS WOULD BE THE LAST TO GO
HE HURRIED DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT WHERE RANDOLPH WAS ARRANGING HIS MIMEOGRAPH
HE BENT DOWN TO LOCATE SOME OF THE RUBBLE ON THE GROUND CURSING HIS FOLLY IN CARRYING HIS KNIFE UNDER HIS UNIFORM
INSTINCT CARRIED HIM FORWARD JERKING DOWN SHARPLY AND TWISTING
BUT IT WAS TWO HOURS AFTER SUNDOWN
IN THE END AS THE NIGHT SPREAD INTO DAY THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY FELT SAFE WITH AND LESS THAN THEY NEEDED
THEY'RE ALL DEAD COBBERS HE WHEEZED
MOBS HAD FOUGHT CITIZENS OUTSIDE THE MAIN MARKET FOR THREE HOURS
SO GRAB WHILE THE GRABBING'S GOOD BECAUSE BY TOMORROW MORNING I'LL HAVE THIS ALL CLOSED DOWN HE SHOOK OFF GORDON'S HAND AND STOOD UP ROUGHLY TO HEAD BACK UP THE HALLWAY
CAN'T LOSE THE OLD MAN SAID
WHEN I GET PAID FOR A JOB I DO THE JOB GORDON WATCHED HIM HEAD DOWN THE BLOCK AND STARTED AFTER THE LITTLE MAN
AS HE TURNED TO LEAVE THE CAPTAIN HELD UP A HAND
HOW DO I SIGN UP WITH YOU CHAPTER XIII ARREST MAYOR WAYNE
THAT DOES IT GOV'NOR
BESIDES IT'LL SHOW ON THE BOOKS THAT THEY DIDN'T KICK INTO HIS FUND
GORDON REPORTING HE ANNOUNCED
WELL YOU'LL BE EARNING YOUR KEEP HERE--YOURS AND THAT GRANDDAUGHTER'S TOO
BUT THERE'LL BE PUSHERS AS LONG AS WEAK MEN TURN TO DRUGS AND GRAFT AS LONG AS VOTERS ALLOW THE THING TO GET OUT OF THEIR HANDS
IT WAS A SIX-INCH SECTION OF PIPE WITH A THIN WISP OF SMOKE AND THE THROW WAS TOWARD GORDON'S FEET
IF HE DID THEM ENOUGH SERVICE THEY MIGHT LET HIM BACK TO EARTH
HE'S ALONE ANYHOW
BEFORE GORDON COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE SHE WAS WHIPPING AROUND INTO AN ALLEY
HE TURNED A CORNER AND CAME TO A SHORT HEAVY HOODLUM BACKING OUT OF A SMALL LIQUOR STORE WITH A KNIFE IN THROWING POSITION
FOR A SECOND HE HESITATED AND THEN THE ACCOUNT OF THE NEWSBOY AND HIS WOULD-BE KILLERS CAME RUSHING OUT
CHAPTER XII WIFE OR PRISONER
HE TWISTED AT THE LAST SECOND JERKING HIS ARMS DOWN TO COME UP FACING THE OTHER
THEN THEY WERE AROUND A SMALL SIDE BUILDING OUT OF DANGER
USE THEM THE MAN STAGGERED BETWEEN THEM WHIMPERING AT EACH STEP
HE LET HIS HAND DROP TO THE GUN
NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM WILL YOU THE WEEK WENT ON MECHANICALLY WHILE HE GRADUALLY ADJUSTED TO THE NEW ANGLES OF BEING A LEGAL
A GOOD JOB THE LITTLE MAN SAID
GORDON'S LEG ACHED FROM HIS STRAINED POSITION BUT HE SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT ONTO IT MORE HEAVILY AND SWEAT POPPED OUT ON THE CROUPIER'S FACE
HE WAS STILL THINKING CLUMSILY AS SHE GOT TO HER FEET AND TURNED TO LEAVE
HOW DO WE DO IT HE FROWNED AND THEN GRINNED SLOWLY
THE WEEK MOVED ON
IT STILL COVERED HALF THE CITY AND MADE BREATHING POSSIBLE HERE WITHOUT A HELMET
HERE ALL THE RIFFRAFF THAT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ESTABLISH ITSELF IN BETTER QUARTERS HAD FOUND SOME SORT OF A HAVEN
CAPTAIN PROBABLY GETS FIFTY PER CENT FROM ONE OF THE PUSHERS WHO'S LINED WITH HIM
THE OLD MAN LAY ON THE BED AND THIS TIME THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF CONCUSSION
YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THAT CONNECTS WITH MINE VACANT I RUN A RESPECTABLE HOUSE NOW GORDON MOTHER COREY STATED FLATLY
WE CAN TRUST YOU I GUESS HE SAID DULLY
HE JERKED HIMSELF DOWN AND SCOOPED IT UP HIS EYES DARTING FOR TRENCH
HE LOOKED UP AS GORDON CAME IN
AND THEY'LL BE WATCHING
TRENCH HAD ONCE BEEN A COLONEL IN THE MARINES BEFORE A COURT-MARTIAL AND SUNDRY UNPLEASANTNESSES HAD DRIVEN HIM OFF EARTH
FINALLY HE BEGAN MAKING THE ROUNDS ACTING AS HIS OWN NIGHT MAN
WHERE'S RANDOLPH AT HIS PLANT
EVERY JOINT WAS CLOSED DOWN TIGHTLY ALREADY
NOW HE FOUND THE WAY BACK TO COREY'S BLOCKED BY A MOB
WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO YOU
THEN HIS FACE FELL
GORDON WHAT ELSE CAN I DO BRUCE GORDON ASKED
WHAT'LL WE DO WITH THE PRISONERS LEAVE EM
THE CROWD QUIETED ALMOST AT ONCE EXCEPT FOR A SINGLE YELL
WITH WHAT YOU PULLED HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A CAPTAINCY GORDON TOLD HIM BRIEFLY
IT MADE NO SENSE
IT SEEMS ARLISS DECIDED TO GET RID OF MAYOR WAYNE BUT DIDN'T COUNT ON WAYNE'S SPIES BEING BETTER THAN HIS
HE STARTED OUT OF THE CROWD TRYING TO ACT NORMAL BUT GLANCING DOWN TO MAKE SURE THE GUN WAS IN ITS PROPER POSITION
WELL THAT'S MARS HE SAID AND TURNED BACK TO HIS PRIVATE QUARTERS
I WON'T EVEN TOUCH YOU HE WAS SURE ENOUGH THAT IT WAS NO ACT ON O'NEILL'S PART
BETTER TELL YOUR HUSBAND WHERE THE BOOK IS CUDDLES SHE CURSED AND HE DREW HER CLOSER
BUT SHE'LL LEARN
BUT WE'RE NOT READY FOR AN EMERGENCY AND IT'S HERE--NOW
IT TOOK ONLY MINUTES FOR DAWN TO BECOME DAY ON MARS AND THE SUN WAS LIGHTING UP THE MESSY SECTION OF BACK STREET WHEN BRUCE GORDON'S EYES OPENED AND THE PAIN OF SIGHT STRUCK HIS ACHING HEAD
COME ON KID HURRY IT UP
DON'T SELL THEM SHORT COBBER
HIS HAND REACHED OUT THE STRAP HIT THE TERMINALS
IF YOU TWO WANT TO CARRY IN THE SNOW COLLECT AND TURN IT OVER TO COMMISSIONER ARLISS FOR ME--I CAN'T PASS THE DOME TILL HE GETS IT--I'LL GIVE YOU BOTH ROOMS FOR SIX MONTHS FREE
NOW IT SWERVED HITTING A SIREN BUTTON
YOU CAN--WE KNOW ABOUT YOU THE OLD WOMAN SIGHED
THERE WAS A THICK CHUCKLE AND THE SOUND OF HANDS BEING RUBBED TOGETHER
THERE WERE A FAIR NUMBER OF PLAIN CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN IMPRESSED INTO IT TOO JUDGING BY THE APPEARANCE OF LITTLE FRIGHTENED GROUPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOBSTERS
GOOD
THEN A VOICE HIT AT HIS EARS AND HE LOOKED UP TO SEE SHEILA COREY ONLY TWO PLACES IN FRONT OF HIM
GORDON GOT HIS HEAD UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE A MAN IN POLICE UNIFORM KICK ASIDE THE FIRST HOODLUM AND LUNGE FOR THE OTHER
THERE WAS A CONFUSED FLURRY
HE STOPPED ONCE FOR DIRECTIONS AND A MAN STARED AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY AND FINALLY THREW A SWITCH RELUCTANTLY
THEY'LL RUIN THE DOME YET
EVERY ODD-NUMBERED SHIELD GOES FROM EVERY PRECINCT
BUT THIS HONESTY STUFF IT'S LIKE DOPE
BUT SECURITY TOOK VENUS--AND I'M NOT WORRIED HERE IN THE LONG RUN
WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST ME WOULDN'T BE HONEST TO CHARGE UNLESS YOU ASKED ME TO CONVOY YOU GOV'NOR
NORTH AMERICA'S CALLED IT ALL A MISTAKEN EMERGENCY MEASURE AND TURNED IT BACK TO SECURITY ALONG WITH HOW MANY WAR ROCKETS GORDON ASKED
WE'LL LIVE SHE ANSWERED HIM
THE MAN WAS DYING NOW
I'LL PAY MOTHER COREY FOR YOUR FOOD--AND FOR YOUR WIFE'S--AND IF I CAN FIND ONE COLUMN'S WORTH OF NEWS IN IT MAYBE I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND WEEK
CHAPTER X MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE BRUCE GORDON JERKED THE DOOR OPEN TO YELL FOR IZZY WHILE HE TUCKED THE BIT OF NOTEBOOK COVER INTO HIS POCKET
IN RETURN THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
BUT HE WAS SURPRISED AT THE LOOK ON HIS TARDY RELIEF'S FACE
THEY IGNORED THE REGISTRATION CLERKS
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
THERE WERE SUSPICIOUS LOOKS AS THE GROUP CAME BACK TO THE COOP BUT MOTHER COREY WADDLED OVER TO MEET THEM
GORDON TURNED HIS ENTIRE PAY OVER TO SHEILA
OKAY BOYS THE VOICE SAID COME ON DOWN
THE OTHER STOPPED TO THINK IT OVER
GORDON SAW A CROWD AROUND IT AND WAS SURPRISED UNTIL HE RECOGNIZED THEM AS RAFTERS--MEN FROM THE BIGGEST OF THE GANGS SUPPORTING WAYNE
THEIR SPOTLIGHT CAUGHT A RUNNING BOY CLUTCHING A FEW THIN COPIES OF THE CRUSADER UNDER A SCRAWNY ARM
IZZY WAS DISGUSTED
HE CAUGHT HER FEET IN HIS HANDS AND YANKED HER BACK
GORDON JUMPED TOWARD THE SOUND TO FIND THE OLD LADY BENDING OVER THE INERT FIGURE OF SHEILA COREY
HE SAW MURDOCH'S CLUB DART IN AND TAKE OUT TWO OF THE GANG ONE ON THE FORWARD SWING ONE ON THE RECOVER
HE STRIPPED OUT THE MONEY--AND FINALLY PUT HALF OF IT BACK INTO THE WALLET AND DROPPED IT BESIDE THE HOODLUM
I'VE NEVER BEEN SURE
THE WEAPON CRUNCHED AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND SLAMMED OVER THE BACK OF HIS NECK ALMOST KNOCKING HIM OUT
THEY'LL BE BLAMING YOU FOR THE END OF THE DOME LET THEM
TO THOSE WHO NOW LEAVE THE ILLEGAL MUNICIPAL FORCE AND ACCEPT THEIR DUTY WITH THE LEGAL FORCE THERE WILL BE NO QUESTION OF PAST CONDUCT
BUT HIS SUIT WAS STILL SEALED
THE WARNING IN TRENCH'S VOICE WASN'T FOR ANY OMISSION ON HIS RECORD HE KNEW
NOW THAT I'VE DUG UP THE SCRATCH TO BUY THESE STRIPES AND GET MADE SERGEANT--AND THAT TAKES THE REAL CRACKLE--I'M FIGURING ON TAKING IT EASY LIKE THIS SOCIAL CALL GORDON ASKED HIM
BY JINX WHEN I HEARD THE MUNICIPALS WERE COMING I WAS SCARED THEY'D GET HIM FOR SURE
HE COULD FEEL THE THICKNESS OF THE SILENCE AND MISERY IN THE TRUCK BUT HE PUSHED IT AWAY WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS
HE STILL HADN'T SOLVED HIS PROBLEM IN THE MORNING
THEY'RE MARRIED IZZY SAID
IT WAS A FULL MINUTE BEFORE SIRENS SOUNDED BEHIND HIM AND NICK THE CROOP HAD FAST TRUCKS
MARSPORT HAD BEEN LOCATED WHERE THE ONLY VEIN OF URANIUM HAD BEEN FOUND ON MARS AND THE GROWING SECTION WAS CLOSER TO THE EQUATOR
GORDON'S HEART FROZE IN HIS THROAT BUT HE WAS ALREADY IN ACTION
THE STREETS WERE ALMOST DESERTED EXCEPT FOR SOME PROWLER OR DESPERATION-DRIVEN DRUG ADDICT
DOING SOMETHING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF NECESSITY WAS ONE THING
BUT THE OTHER TOOK IT AS INTEREST
I'VE BEEN SHOPPING AND I SPENT THE MONEY THE MAN GAVE ME
OKAY BETTER PIN THESE ON HE HANDED OUT GAUDY ARM BANDS AND THE THREE FASTENED THEM IN PLACE
IN ONE CORNER WAS AN UNSHEETED BED
SOMETIMES YOU'RE--NICE NICE PEOPLE DON'T GET TO MARS
EARTH COP TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
COME ON CAP'N WE GOTTA GET OUT THE VOTE MURDOCH SHOOK HIS HEAD
HIS EYES FLICKERED AROUND TRYING TO SPOT SOMETHING IN THE DARKNESS THAT WOULD GIVE HIM SHELTER
HERE THAT WAS BEST DONE BY WIPING OUT THE STONEWALL GANG TO THE LAST MEMBER
GORDON FELT THE BLADE STRIKE
MOTHER COREY HAD RUN A SOMEWHAT ORDERLY PLACE WITH CONSTANT VIGILANCE
HE WAS PLAYING MORE THAN FAIR WITH BRUCE GORDON NOW BUT THERE WAS A BASIC SUSPICION IN HIS EYES
IN THE END HE WAS GIVEN A CAPTAIN'S PAY AND THE RANK OF SERGEANT
THIS IS AN OLD PATTERN FELLOW MARTIANS
THERE WAS NO ANSWER THOUGH HE WAS SURE THE OLD COUPLE LIVED JUST OVER THE STORE
ALL RIGHT MEN HE SHOUTED
FROM INSIDE CAME THE RARE SOUND OF WATER SPLASHING MIXED WITH A WHEEZING OFF-KEY CATERWAULING
I'VE GOT KIDS OF MY OWN
HE PULLED THE CARDS OUT OF HIS POUCH TRYING TO BE CASUAL
HOW MUCH HE ASKED AS THE KID SCOOPED UP THE BLADES AND SHOVED THEM EXPERTLY BACK INTO SHOULDER SHEATHS
GORDON COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE HADN'T AT LEAST BEEN KEPT ON DUTY UNTIL HONEST IZZY CAME INTO THE ROOM
THIS MAN COMES
TAKES IT KIND OF HARD DOESN'T HE YEAH GORDON ANSWERED
HE SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS AS HE HAD KEPT TO HIMSELF ON THE TEN-DAY TRIP BETWEEN EARTH AND MARS WITH THE YELLOW STUB OF HIS TICKET STILL STUCK DEFIANTLY IN THE BAND OF HIS HAT PROCLAIMING THAT EARTH HAD PAID HIS PASSAGE WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION BEING ASKED
YOU MET HER COBBER
THEY WENT THROUGH AND OUT INTO THE WASTE AND SLUMS BEYOND THE DOMES HEADING OUT UNTIL THERE WERE ONLY THE FEW PHOSPHOR BULBS TO GUIDE THEIR WAY
ONE OF THE CORPORALS STARTED TO STAND UP AND HALT HIM BUT WAVERED AT THE SIGHT OF THE CAPTAIN'S STAR THAT WAS STILL PINNED TO HIS UNIFORM
THERE WAS NO EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
IT LOOKS AS IF YOUR GRANDFATHER PICKS THEM BETTER FOR YOU YOU FILTHY-MINDED HOG
GO SEND YOUR SOB STORIES MURDOCH THEY TAUGHT A BUNCH OF PRETTY MAXIMS IN SCHOOL--EVEN SLUM KIDS LEARNED THAT HONESTY WAS THE BEST POLICY WHILE THEIR HONEST PARENTS ROTTED IN UNHEATED HOLES AND THE RACKETEERS RODE AROUND IN FANCY CARS
WELL I GUESS YOU GOTTA FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF
HIS EYES CAUGHT THE SIGHT OF A HAND POINTING BEHIND HIM AND HE KNEW IT WAS TOO CRUDE A TRICK TO BOTHER WITH
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A FAILURE
YOU CAN GO BACK TO EARTH BRUCE BUT YOU WON'T LIKE IT NOW
I PICKED UP SOME SPECIAL PERMITS HE SAID
BESIDE HIM A COP WAS DRINKING THE SAME SLOWLY WATCHING ANOTHER POLICEMAN AT A CANFIELD GAME
GORDON SWUNG AT ONE DUCKED A BLOW FROM THE OTHER AND THEN SAW THE FIRST SWINGING AGAIN
THE BARTENDER HAD A CONSOLATION BOILERMAKER WAITING
WELL I'M SECURITY
THEY GAVE HIM A CHAUFFEUR BACK TO THE CHICKEN COOP AND POLITELY INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE STAYED WITHIN REACH
AND THE FRONT WAS COVERED WITH A BIG SIGN THAT SPELLED OUT CONDEMNED
PROVES A MAN SHOULDN'T HAVE FRIENDS RANDOLPH'S FACE WAS STILL GREENISH-WHITE BUT HE STRAIGHTENED AND MANAGED A FEEBLE SMILE
I'M KEEPING THE NOTEBOOK FOR INSURANCE
NOTHING LIKE MARSPORT BUT THAT'S NO LOSS
MEANS THEY'RE SCARED WE MAY DO IT
HE TOSSED HIS DOOR OPEN AND FOUND THE LETTER ON HIS BED
NUMBER FORTY-TWO HIS HEAVY HAND RESTED ON GORDON'S ARM HOLDING THE YOUNGER MAN BACK
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY THE GUARD THOUGHT IT OVER AND REACHED FOR THE RELEASE
YOU'RE A SERGEANT FROM NOW ON INSIDE A THICK EFFLUVIUM HIT HIS NOSE AND GORDON TURNED TO SEE MOTHER COREY'S HUGE BULK WADDLING DOWN THE HALL
HE REPORTED BACK TO THE PRECINCT WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED IN HIS HAND AND HIS PEN ITCHING FOR THE DONATION AGREEMENT
AND YOU'D BETTER BE SEEN VOTING OFTEN TOO CAP'N
NOT A CENT LEFT
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE WORSE HAPPENS
IF YOU EVER LOOK AT MY RECORD YOU'LL FIND I'M AN EX-NEWSPAPERMAN MYSELF
YOURS IS IN THERE SHE SAID THICKLY
GORDON'S CREDITS WERE CHANGED TO LEGAL SCRIP AND HE WAS ISSUED A TRIM-FITTING GREEN UNIFORM
AND HE WAS TOO TIRED TO CHASE THEM DOWN
ANOTHER CAME OUT FROM THE REAR OF ONE OF THE TRUCKS
FOR THE TIME BEING THE HOODS AND PUNKS WERE HAVING A TOUGH TIME OF IT WITH WORKING PAPERS DEMANDED AS CONSTANT IDENTIFICATION
HE STOOD UP GRABBING FOR HIS BAG AND SPINNING THE DRUMMER ASIDE
MURDOCH THREW THE SECOND GANGSTER UP INTO A TRUCK AFTER THE FIRST ONE AND SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT LOCKING IT WITH THE METAL BAR WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN HIS WEAPON
THE NOLAN MAN GULPED AND NODDED
WITH ELECTIONS COMING UP AND THE BOYS LOADED WITH VOTE MONEY BACK IN TOWN--WITH A DECK OF CHEATERS LIKE THAT--YOU WANT TO EAT HE PICKED THE DECK UP FONDLY WHILE A FARAWAY LOOK CAME INTO HIS CLOUDED EYES
THEY COULD RIP IT BUT NOT RUIN IT COMPLETELY
WE CAN WORK ENOUGH POWDER UNDER THOSE WEBBING SUPPORTS AND LAY THE FUSE WIRE BESIDE THE PLASTIC RING THAT KEEPS IT AIRTIGHT HE REPORTED
I FIGURE ON MAKING IT LAST SIX HERE AND DON'T LET MY BEING A FIRSTER GIVE YOU HOT PALMS
REPORT OR BE KICKED OFF TO A PLANET THAT SECURITY FELT ENOUGH WORSE THAN MARS TO USE AS PUNISHMENT
IT'S EASY ENOUGH AND YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF CREDIT IN THE FUND FOR IT
HIS BOOT LIFTED AND THE FLASHLIGHT SPUN ASIDE BROKEN AND DARK
JURGENS WAS WAITING FOR HIM WHEN HE CAME ON THE BEAT
IT IS BETTER HE CAUGHT HER AS SHE FELL TOWARD HIM
I ATE SOMETHING YESTERDAY
IT WAS GORDON'S FIRST LOOK AT THE REAL MARS
DISMISSED
AT THAT RATE HE'D HAVE TO STAND IT ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS
ONE OF THE OLDER MEN ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS
THEN HE COOLED HIS HEELS WHILE THE FLORID PAUNCHY EX-POLITICIAN COMMISSIONER CRANE WORRIED ABOUT HIS RATING AND REPEATED HOW CORRUPT MARS WAS AND HOW THE COLLECTION SYSTEM WAS OVER--ABSOLUTELY OVER
OUT IN THE STICKS BEATING UP HELPLESS MEN
WHO KNOWS
THE OLD CHARTER FOR MARSPORT FROM NORTH AMERICA WAS DEAD AND THE WHOLE CITY WAS NOW UNDER SECURITY CHARTER LIKE THE REST OF THE PLANET
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TWO WORLDS
IT HAD BEEN A CRUDE JOB WITH ONLY A WICK FOR A FUSE
THE BIG GUY SIMPLY LUNGED WITH HIS HANDS OUT
HE BENT TO THE GROUND SEIZING THE FIRST ROCKS HE COULD FIND AND THREW THEM
HE HIT THE SEAT AND RAMMED DOWN THE THROTTLE WITH HIS FOOT BEFORE HE COULD GET HIS HANDS ON THE WHEEL
AS SOON AS WE GET CHASED OFF I'LL MANAGE TO SET IT OFF WHILE THEY'RE RELAXING AND LAUGHING AT US IT SMELLS IZZY TOLD HIM
TRENCH SAT CHEWING ON A CIGAR
IT WAS TRENCH HIMSELF WHO LEAPED OUT TOGETHER WITH THE DRIVER
RIFLES LIFTED INSIDE AND SHOTS RANG OUT CLIPPING BULLETS THROUGH THE DOME
THEN HE TURNED UP HIS MARSPEAKER
AND YOU CAN TELL PRAEGER WE GOT PLENTY OF MEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN CASE HE CAN USE EM HE PULLED UP TO SHOUT A REPORT THROUGH THE BIG MARSPEAKER AS THEY PASSED THE OLD BUILDING MURDOCH HAD USED AS A PRECINCT HOUSE
THE PLANTERS WERE MOVING EFFICIENTLY
YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE WITH MORE TICKETS
CUT SPEED
WHEN EARTH HAD DEPORTED ALL ADDICTS TWO DECADES BEFORE IT HAD PRACTICALLY BEGGED FOR DOPE SMUGGLING
THE PUG SAW THE BLADE AND TRIED TO CHECK HIS LUNGE
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IZZY PRICE OF BEING HONEST
THE GUN DROPPED FROM O'NEILL'S HAND AS THE WRIST SNAPPED AND THE STONEWALL CHIEF LET OUT A HIGH-PITCHED CRY OF PAIN
VOTING BOOTHS WERE BEING FINISHED HERE AND THERE AND AT ONE A SMALL TRUCK WAS DELIVERING BALLOTS
HE DUCKED INTO THE TRUCK NODDING
OTHERWISE IT WOULD TAKE THIRTY
HE'D LAID OUT A PROGRAM FOR A CITIZENS VIGILANTE COMMITTEE AND HAD DRILLED ENOUGH IN THE RUTHLESS USE OF THE CLUB TO KEEP THE GANGS DOWN
CHAPTER III THE GRAFT IS GREEN IZZY SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN HE FOUND THAT GORDON WAS TURNING IN TO THE QUASI-SECRET ENTRANCE TO MOTHER COREY'S
YOU KNOW ED--JUST TELL HIM I SENT YOU
ELEVENTH PRECINCT THERE WERE SCOWLS BUT THEY LET IT GO
HEH-HEH YES JUST A MIX-UP
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT MARSPORT WAS THE POISON CENTER HERE
OUTSIDE THEY HAD A TRUCK WAITING
GORDON LOOSENED HIS KNIFE AND TIGHTENED HIS GRIP ON THE LOCUST STICK
BRUCE GORDON WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET A FAIR FIT IN HIS SUIT
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHERS NOW SHE GRIMACED
TRENCH LEFT SOME INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT YOU AND HIS VOICE WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL BUT GORDON SAW THE HAND MOVE SUDDENLY TOWARD THE DRAWER THAT WAS HALF-OPEN
INSIDE THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF FOOD AND A RATHER PRETTY GIRL BROUGHT OUT ANOTHER PLATTER AND SET IT BEFORE GORDON
THEN A SHOUT WENT UP YANKING HIS EYES AROUND WITH THE REST OF THOSE STANDING NEAR
THE ENTRANCE WAS UNPROTECTED
POOR DEVILS GORDON JERKED UP IN SURPRISE
HE'S AN ENGINEER ON OUR RAILROAD GORDON ACKNOWLEDGED THE INTRODUCTION AUTOMATICALLY
WE CAN'T PAY HIM
TRENCH PUT HIS COFFEE DOWN AND YELLED FOR MORE
THERE WAS NO POINT IN WEARING THE HELMET INSIDE THE DOME BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN TRYING TO RENT ONE AT THE LOCKERS
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD I STINK SO MUCH YOU CAN'T STAND ME IN THE NEXT ROOM HELL I'VE GOTTEN SO I CAN STAND YOUR GRANDFATHER HE ANSWERED
THIS ISN'T A GAME
THE NEXT DAY HIS RELIEF WAS LATER
THE TRUCKS WHEELED THROUGH AND GORDON DROPPED BACK TO LET SCOUT TRUCKS GO AHEAD AND PICK OFF ANY RASH ENOUGH TO HEAD FOR THE CALL BOXES
GOOD WORK SERGEANT
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D THINK OF THAT GORDON
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU SHEILA GORDON JERKED THE WORD OUT
HE'S MY UNCLE THERE'S A MIKE THALER REGISTERED AND THIS GUY SAYS HE'S THALER THE WAYNE MAN SAID DECISIVELY
TELL THE MEN WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT TRENCH IS LOSING AND INTENDS TO BLOW IT UP INSTEAD OF LETTING THE LEGALS WIN RUMOR WOULD TRAVEL FAST ENOUGH HE HOPED
BY THE WAY THANKS FOR KILLING THAT SNIPER
HE'D PRACTICED ALL THE WAY FROM EARTH
HE WAITED FOR THE GUARD TO VANISH AND THEN WENT CRAWLING FORWARD
YOUR MEAL TICKET WAS IN DANGER
ALL MEMBERS OF EITHER GOVERNMENT WERE INDICTED FOR HIGH TREASON TO SECURITY
DAMN IT HE SAID
BUT HE'D TAKEN THE DAMNED BADGE
THE OPERATORS ALL SWORE THAT WAYNE WOULD BE ELECTED BUT SEEMED TO FEAR A MIRACLE
THE ROOM AT THE NEW MOTHER COREY'S--AN UNKEMPT OLD BUILDING NEAR THE EDGE OF THE DOME--PROVED TO BE LIVABLE THOUGH IT WAS A SHOCK TO SEE MOTHER COREY HIMSELF IN A DECENT SUIT AND USING PERFUME
THEY SET SECURITY UP AS A NICE LITTLE DEBATING SOCIETY GORDON TO MAKE IT EASY FOR NORTH AMERICA TO GRAB THE PLANETS BY DOING IT THROUGH THAT AGENCY
THE LEGALS SIMPLY CAME BOILING DOWN THE STREET EQUIPPED WITH LONG PIKES WITH LEAD-WEIGHTED ENDS
WE'VE GOT JUNIOR MEN--DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL CLERKS SUCH THINGS
BUT HE PAUSED SHOCKED TO SEE THE GIRL HE'D SEEN ON MOTHER COREY'S STAIRS GAZING AT HIM IN WELL-FEIGNED WARNING
THE CARDS WERE PLASTIC AND SHOULD BE GOOD FOR A WEEK OR SO OF USE BEFORE THEY SHOWED WEAR
THERE WAS A SERIES OF MOTIONS THAT SEEMED TO HAVE NO PATTERN
THEY HAVE TO BE
TAKING OVER ALL THE RACKETS FOR THE WHOLE CITY THE DARK FACE SNARLED WHILE THE GIANT MOVED A STEP FORWARD
NOW THIS GANG TRIES TO POISON THEM
SO THE BAD PENNIES TURN UP
BUT GORDON I'M OFFERING YOU A CHANCE
CONTACT IZZY NINETY PER CENT FOR UNCUT IZZY ANSWERED
SHE WAS RUNNING TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE STREET FRANTICALLY TRYING TO FLAG HIM DOWN AND HE BARELY MANAGED TO SWERVE AROUND HER
CRANE WANTS TO WATCH THIS GUY SHOT IN PERSON HE GRABBED RANDOLPH BY THE ARM
THE MAN BEHIND THE MACHINE GUN DROPPED
ONCE I BROKE EVERY STRONG-MAN RECORD ON EARTH--STILL STAND TOO
IZZY SAID YOU'D BE AROUND
IT MADE NO SENSE TO HIM AND HE DIDN'T CARE
WALK O'NEILL HE ORDERED
THE ONLY THING YOU'LL GET OUT OF IT IS A CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER CHANCE FOR OTHERS SOME DAY--AND A PROMISE THAT THERE'LL BE MORE UNTIL YOU GET OLD ENOUGH TO SIT AT A DESK ON EARTH AND FIGHT AGAINST EVERY BICKERING NATION THERE TO KEEP THE PLANETS CLEAN
ALL RIGHT RANDY I GUESS WE'RE A BUNCH OF REFUGEES HEADING FOR THE OUTSIDE AND BLOODY LUCKY AT THAT
THERE WAS ALSO A SMALL CLOTH BAG CONTAINING A FEW SCRAPS OF CLOTHES
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ALIVE AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GOING TO BE A SPY FOR SECURITY THE OTHER HAD SHRUGGED
ONLY HONEST THING TO DO WAS TO JOIN THE LEGALS AND GET YOUR RATING UPPED TO A LIEUTENANT MOTHER COREY OBSERVED
YOU'RE LIKE SECURITY GORDON
HE THREW THE TWO INTO THE BACK AND STRUCK A CAUTIOUS LIGHT
HE WAS SWEATING AND THE SURPRISE IN HIS EYES INDICATED THAT THIS WAS ALL NEW TO HIM
COMING DOWN THROUGH THE THIN AIR OF MARS WAS THE BRIGHT BLUE EXHAUST OF A ROCKET
RANDOLPH GRINNED AT HIM
FORTY PER CENT
BUT MOTHER COREY CUT IN HIS VOICE OLDER AND HOARSER AND THE SKIN ON HIS JOWLS EVEN GRAYER THAN USUAL
THE SEAL SUDDENLY QUIVERED INDICATING THAT METAL INSIDE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN
YOUR HOME WORLD HAS APPOINTED MARCUS GANNETT AS MAYOR WITH PHILIP CRANE AS CHIEF OF POLICE
THEY COME UP HERE TO START OVER--MAYBE SPENT HALF THEIR LIFE SAVING UP FOR THE TRIP
ONCE THE POLICE WERE ALL BUSY INSIDE THE DOME WITH THEIR PRIVATE WAR THE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING ORDER IN THE WHOLE TERRITORY BEYOND
THE HEEL GROUND HARDER BRINGING A GROAN FROM HIM
NO CO-OPERATION WITH YOUR CAPTAIN UNTIL HE FORCED IT
SHOULD TURN EM OVER TO US COPS SCHULBERG SAID
THEN HE WAS UPRIGHT WAVING EMPTY HANDS AT THEM WITH THE THIN SMILE ON HIS FACE DEEPENING
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN OPENED
UNIFORM OR NO UNIFORM I'M WALKING BEAT TODAY
IZZY WENT AHEAD ALMOST SILENT WITH A THIN STRAND OF WIRE BETWEEN HIS HANDS HIS ELBOWS WEAVING BACK AND FORTH SLOWLY TO GUIDE HIM
I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIM AND TELL HIM YOU'RE MIXED UP IN SECURITY AND THAT YOU EITHER HAVE PAPERS ON YOU OR OUT AT THE CHICKEN COOP TO PROVE IT
MAYBE IT WOULD BREAK THE JINX
AND THEN YOU COME AND YOU GET YOUR MONEY
THERE HAD BEEN AT LEAST NINETY KNOWN KILLINGS
HE'D MEANT TO SAY REVOLUTION BUT
IT WAS LOADED WITH CAFFEINE AT LEAST
OKAY CAPTAIN
ASK THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN GETTING KICKED AROUND ABOUT SECURITY AND YOU'LL FIND THAT EVEN MOST OF MARSPORT DOESN'T HATE IT
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH IT
HE LIFTED THE SWITCH IN HIS HANDS AND STARED AT IT
THERE WAS A SPORADIC FIRING GOING ON THERE AND A KNOT OF MUNICIPALS WERE CLUSTERED AROUND A FEW LEGALS BUSY WITH KNIVES AND CLUBS
HE WANTED TO SHOW YOU A BADGE--A SECURITY BADGE MADE OUT FOR HIM SHE ANSWERED
AND PROBABLY HOODS FROM THE GANGS THAT RULED THE NIGHTS HERE
LOOK AT IZZY'S FACE GORDON
HE STOPPED WHEN HIS MONEY WAS DOWN TO A HUNDRED CREDITS HARDLY REALIZING WHAT HE WAS DOING
AND--SOMETHING ELSE
BUT MARSPORT HAS THAT SACRED DOME OVER IT
HE KEPT HIS FOOT TO THE FLOOR STREWING BITS OF THE BARRICADE BEHIND HIM UNTIL HE WAS BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE LEGAL GUNS THAT WERE FIRING SUDDENLY
TIE THEM UP IZZY HENDRIX WAS FASTER THAN GORDON HAD THOUGHT
YOU--WHY YOU ME OR TRENCH
COME ON IT'S A LONG WALK HE LEFT THE CAR BEYOND THE GATE AND THEY PUSHED THROUGH THE LOCKER ROOM TOWARD THE SMALLER EXIT STOPPING TO FASTEN DOWN THEIR HELMETS
LOOTING HAD STEPPED UP
IT WAS FARTHER THAN HE'D THOUGHT AND GORDON BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE'D MISSED THE WAY UNTIL HE SAW THE DRUGSTORE
SHEILA CAME UP OFF THE COUCH WITH A CHOKING CRY AND LEAPED FOR THE DOOR
YET IN SPITE OF ALL THE BALLOT-STUFFING AND INTIMIDATIONS WAYNE HAD BARELY SQUEAKED THROUGH BY A FOUR PER CENT MAJORITY
DAMN IT HE SHOULD HAVE HIRED A FEW OF THE YOUNGER BUMS FROM MOTHER COREY'S
IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT WAYNE COULD BE RE-ELECTED THOUGH EVEN WITH THE POWER OF THE GANGS
BRUCE A DIM LIGHT SNAPPED ON AND HE STARED DOWN AT SHEILA
IT'S ALL AUTHORIZED IN THE PLANS THERE
WAS GONNA TRY MYSELF BUT I DON'T KNOW PRAEGER SCHULBERG SAID
WELL SHE LOOKED AT HIM A LONG TIME IN SILENCE AND THERE WAS SURPRISE IN HER EYES
HE LET HER HIT THE GROUND CAUGHT BOTH HER WRISTS IN HIS AND BROUGHT HIS KNEE DOWN ON HER THROAT APPLYING MORE PRESSURE UNTIL SHE LAY STILL
HIS FOOT HIT SOME OF THE RUBBLE ON THE GROUND AT THE LAST SECOND AND HE SKIDDED
YOU'RE THE WRONG KIND
THE PRINCESS TOOK OFF IN A CAR THREE HOURS AGO HE SAID
BUT GORDON SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE SPAT SAVAGELY INTO HIS HAND AND JUMPED FOR THE BOMB
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A WOMAN NOW REMEMBER SHE WAS SWEARING HOTLY AS THEY LEFT BUT MADE NO ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW
IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH FOR SPEED BUT HEAVY ENOUGH TO BREAK BONES WHERE IT HIT
HE REALIZED HE'D BEEN A LOT LESS CAUTIOUS THAN HE'D THOUGHT
HE ROLLED TO HIS FEET LETTING OUT A YELL OF HIS OWN AND PLUNGED FORWARD
ISAIAH TRENCH WAS STILL CAPTAIN OF THE SEVENTH PRECINCT
THERE WAS A THIN HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM AS A COLLARBONE BROKE
THAT'S MARS HE ROLLED THE DICE OUT THEN PICKED THEM UP AGAIN
THEY HAD TRAVELED THE SIX BLOCKS AND WERE TURNING DOWN A SIDE STREET WHEN THEY FOUND THEIR FIRST CASE
DOWN THE CENTER CRUDE STITCHES OF HEAVY CORD SHOWED WHERE SHE HAD SEWED THE BLANKET TO THE MATTRESS TO DIVIDE IT INTO TWO SECTIONS
HERE HERE'S THE SCRATCH WE SCRAPED UP HE PASSED OVER A BAG FILLED WITH A COLLECTION OF SMALL BILLS AND COINS
IT WAS THE FIRST REFERENCE HE'D HEARD TO HIS BACKGROUND AND HE PREFERRED TO LET IT DROP
THIS IS A RULE 6 CLEARANCE
APPARENTLY CHIEF JUSTICE ARLISS HAD BROKEN WITH THE WAYNE ADMINISTRATION AND THE MIMEOGRAPHED FORM WAS A LEGAL RULING THAT WAYNE WAS NO LONGER MAYOR SINCE THE CHARTER HAD BEEN VOIDED
IT DON'T BELONG TO YOU ANYHOW
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAD EXPLAINED WHAT A FOOL HE'D BEEN FOR PRINTING HALF OF A STORY THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE PRINTED UNTIL ALL COULD BE REVEALED
NOW I FIGURE WE CAN ALL KICK IN A LITTLE TO HELP HIS CAMPAIGN
IF THEY'D FOUND THE CAREFULLY WORKED-IN POWDER
FROM WHERE GORDON STOOD IT LOOKED LIKE A CLEAR VICTORY FOR THE REFORMER NOLAN
HE TURNED BACK TOWARD THE COOP SICK WITH THE DEATH OF THE KID AND THE VIOLENCE
AND I AIN'T STAYING ON THE STREETS WHEN IT GETS GOING A SMALL POLICE CAR WAS WAITING OUTSIDE AND THEY HEADED FOR IT
THE MAN'S WEIGHT WAS A STIFF LOAD EVEN ON MARS
HE HEADED FOR THE PRIVATE ENTRANCE OUT OF HABIT AND THEN SHRUGGED AS HE REALIZED IT WAS A NEEDLESS PRECAUTION NOW
HE PICKED HER UP AND TOSSED HER BACK INTO THE ROOM
SPACEMEN WHO'D MISSED THEIR SHIPS
HENDRIX HAD DROPPED TO HIS KNEES AND FIRED BEFORE TRENCH COULD KNOCK THE GUN FROM HIS HANDS
IN ONE PLACE IT BEGAN TO TEAR AND THERE WAS A SUDDEN SAVAGE ROAR FROM THE MEN AROUND GORDON
SECURITY HAD WANTED HIM TO POLICE THEIR DAMNED PLANET FOR THEM--AND HE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT OFFICIALLY
THIS IS A SOCIAL GAME COBBERS OUTSIDE THE PARADE PICKED UP ENTHUSIASM AS SMALLER GANGS JOINED BEHIND THE MAIN ONE
I KNEW IT GOV'NOR--KNEW IT THE MINUTE I HEARD JURGENS WAS A COP
I CAN LOCK HER UP--CARRYING A GUN WITHOUT A PERMIT IS REASON ENOUGH
HE MUST HAVE HAD HIS TOTAL CAPITAL WITH HIM BECAUSE STARK RUIN SHONE IN HIS EYES
HIS KNIFE SLASHED UPWARDS AND THE LEGAL FELL--ALMOST ON TOP OF THE SECURITY BADGE THAT HAD DROPPED FROM GORDON'S POUCH
THE KID MADE THE SOUND HE USED FOR ASSENT
I HAD BIG PLANS FOR YOU GORDON
HE GRINNED AGAIN
ANOTHER WEEK OF BEING A FAILURE ON THIS PLANET OF FAILURES AND I MIGHT
THE PRICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIXED IN ADVANCE
THE POLICE HAD ORDERS TO BEAT ANY MEMBER ON SIGHT NOW
YOU'RE IN THEN CALL THEM OFF A WHEEZING CHUCKLE ANSWERED HIM AND A PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WEAKLY SHEDDING SOME LIGHT ON A FILTHY HALL
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD TO LOOK YOU UP HE SAID
NEED A CONVOY GORDON STUDIED HIM BRIEFLY AND GRINNED
TO MAKE UP FOR IT STANDS WERE BEING PLACED ALONG THE STREETS CARRYING BANNERS THAT PROCLAIMED FREE BEER FOR ALL LOYAL ADMINISTRATION FRIENDS
NOLAN WAS PROBABLY A GRAFTER TOO
I GOT ENOUGH OUT OF THE MOTHER TO CASE THE PITCH HE SAID
THERE WAS A GUARD BESIDE AN ELEVATOR BUT IZZY'S KNIFE TOOK CARE OF HIM
SHE WAS BACK A FEW SECONDS LATER WITH A SMALL PURSE
OKAY CUDDLES YOU BURNED IT
SECURITY'S THE ONLY HOPE GORDON--THE ONLY CHANCE MARS HAD HAS OR WILL HAVE
STANDING NEXT TO THE DOME WAS TRENCH TALKING TO ONE OF THE GUARDS
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE
YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE--AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS--WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT
STILL TIME--I THINK
HE BEGAN BANGING AGAIN
SHEILA IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THAT DOME WE'D BE KILLED SHE SAID
THE NEXT DAY HE DRAFTED IZZY AND GORDON FOR A TRIP OUTSIDE THE DOME
THEY WERE ONE OF THE FEW TEAMS IN THE SEVENTH PRECINCT TO MAKE FULL QUOTA
HOW ABOUT A GAME OF SHANKS THE STEPS MOVED AWAY
HE TRIED TO BRING HIS CLUB UP--BUT KNEW IT WAS TOO LATE
AND I'M DOUBLING YOUR ASSESSMENT RIGHT NOW
YEAH WHEN HE FORGETS HE'S A MACHINE
IZZY GRUNTED SUDDENLY
IT HELD ONLY A SMALL SHEAF OF BILLS
EXTRA AIR INSIDE AND THE BEST WE COULD DO FOR FOOD
THEN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK
A LOT BETTER THAN THE MEAL TICKET YOU BOUGHT
HE CAME BACK FROM WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS DAY OFF TO FIND IZZY IN UNIFORM WAITING GRIMLY
WE'RE NOT THROWING THE BOOK AT YOU BRUCE
HE SPOTTED THE THREE AND JERKED HIS THUMB
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
THE KID STUMBLED AND SLID ACROSS THE GROUND WHILE BLOOD SPURTED OUT FROM A GASH ACROSS HIS HEAD AND THE HELMET FELL INTO PIECES
HE TURNED IT OVER IN HIS MIND KNOWING THAT HER WORDS COULDN'T CHANGE THE FACTS
NOW IT ALL FELL INTO PLACE--THE FIRST BEAT HE'D HAD WITH IZZY
THE MAN SWUNG SUSPICIOUSLY THEN GRINNED WEAKLY
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU QUITE A WHILE YOU KNOW
LET HIM FEEL IT A WHILE
WHY CAN'T THEY STICK TO KNIVES HE WAS STUDYING A MAP OF THE BIG BUILDING PICKING THEIR BEST ENTRANCE
BUT--SOMETIMES
IT HAD BEEN A ROCKET-MAINTENANCE HANGAR ONCE THEN HAD BEEN TURNED INTO TEMPORARY DWELLING FOR THE FIRST DEPORTEES WHEN EARTH BEGAN FLOODING MARS
YOU'RE A GOOD SHOT
THERE WERE A DOZEN OR SO GAMBLING JOINTS HALF A DOZEN CHEAP SALOONS AND A FAIR NUMBER OF PLACES LISTED AS ROOMING HOUSES THOUGH THEY MADE NO BONES ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALL THEIR PERMANENT INHABITANTS WERE FEMALE
FAST AS HIS REACTION WAS IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE
BUT EVERY STREET AND ALLEY HAD TO BE KEPT UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE TO DRIVE OUT THE ANGRY DESPERATE MEN WHO WERE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING TO HANG ONTO BEFORE EVERYTHING COLLAPSED

STREET WOMEN AND PETTY GRIFTERS
HE BROUGHT HIS PALM DOWN AGAINST IT AND HEARD A FAINT HISSING
COMING BACK THE GOONS PICKED ME UP AND GAVE ME THE JOB ON YOU
DAMN IT YOU'RE MEN NOT SHARKS
WITH LUCK HE MIGHT JUMP OVER THEM USING HIS EARTH STRENGTH
SHE LEFT A NOTE FOR YOU
HE SHOVED THE ENVELOPE INTO HIS BELT POCKET AND WAITED UNTIL HE WAS IN HIS OWN ROOM BEFORE OPENING IT
WIRE AND EXPLOSIVE STILL THERE GORDON ASKED
GORDON BROKE INTO A SLOW TROT BEHIND IZZY UNTIL THEY COULD SPOT ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING CABS
IF THE FUSE WAS POWDER-SOAKED HE HAD NO CHANCE
AH WELL LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT HERE
IZZY CAME BACK AS MOTHER COREY FINISHED THE DOOR AND BEGAN KNOCKING A SMALL PANEL OUT OF THE CONNECTING DOOR
REMIND ME TO TELL YOU SOMETIME HOW MUCH FUN IT'S BEEN YOUR MOTHER WAS GOOD WITH A SOLDERING IRON WASN'T SHE
DAMN YOU HER CRY WAS MORE IN ANGUISH THEN IT HAD BEEN WHEN HE WAS THREATENING TO BREAK HER BACK
AND THE FACE WAS FILLED WITH LINES OF STRAIN THAT HADN'T BEEN THERE BEFORE
IT WAS CAPTAIN MURDOCH--NOW DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF A REGULAR BEAT COP WITHOUT EVEN A CORPORAL'S STRIPES
HIS FACE WAS BLANCHED HIS CLOTHES A MESS
COREY SEEMED TO PRICK UP HIS EARS AND BEGAN TO WADDLE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE ENTRANCE
THAT'S ALL
ALL RIGHT CUDDLES HE SAID FINALLY
ONCE IN THE TUNNEL THAT LED TO THE BUILDING HE FELT A LITTLE SAFER
SHE MUST HAVE SENSED HIS DESIRE TO BE LEFT ALONE SINCE SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW
HE JERKED HIS HEAD AND THE TWO MEN WENT OUT LEAVING HIM ALONE WITH SHEILA
MOTHER I WANT ALL THE DOPE WE FOUND WITH THAT--ABOUT THE ONLY SUPPLY OF ANY SIZE LEFT--HE COULD COMMAND UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY FROM EVERY ADDICT WHO HADN'T ALREADY DIED FROM LACK OF IT
BUT THE DOZEN SECURITY MEN HAD LEFT MOST OF THE CONTROL IN THE MOTHER'S HANDS AND THE OLD MAN WAS UP TO HIS FAT JOWLS IN BUSINESS
I'M HEAD OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE FOR THIS QUADRANT
NO REGISTRATION THE WAYNE CHECKER SHRUGGED
IF SECURITY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TIME WILL SECURITY GORDON MUTTERED BITTERLY
THEN SHE BEGAN PUTTING HER SUPPLIES AWAY TUCKING THEM INTO A BAG THAT HELD NOTES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM HIS POCKETS--HER SHARE OF THE LOOT APPARENTLY
THIS WOULD TAKE NEARLY ALL OF IT
WITH THE CREDIT THEY'D ACCUMULATED IN THE FUND NEARLY ALL THEIR COLLECTION WAS THEIRS
I LEARNED TO TAKE ORDERS THOUGH--AND I TOOK THEM UNTIL WAYNE TRIED TO PUT A BULLET THROUGH ME
HE KNEW THEN THAT THE FEW PROFITS FROM THE CHEAP BEER WERE NEVER GOING HOME WITH THE MAN
TAKE HIM ASIDE
GUNS AND CONTRABAND AMMUNITION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FROM EARTH
BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE HE SAID AS HE PAID MOTHER COREY FOR THE MATERIALS AND WORK
HE NEEDS NO BEDS NOW AND YOUR FRIEND IS SUFFERING
YOU HAVE A WAY WITH WOMEN IT SEEMS
MY BROTHER WAS LANNY GORDON IT HAPPENED TO BE TRUE THOUGH BRUCE GORDON HADN'T SEEN HIS BROTHER FROM THE TIME THE MAN HAD LEFT THE FAMILY AS A YOUNG PUNK TO THE DAY THEY FINALLY CONVICTED HIM ON HIS TWENTY-FIRST MURDER
BUT I REMEMBER HIS NAME IN THE BOOK GORDON SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAT UP
YOU WERE ANXIOUS ENOUGH TO PICK THE LOCK AND GET OUT I DIDN'T PICK IT--YOU FORGOT TO LOCK IT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE'D DONE AFTER HE FOUND THE BADGE
THE PAST ELECTIONS ARE HEREBY DECLARED NULL AND VOID
RANDOLPH'S FRAIL HAND CAME DOWN TO HELP THEM UP BUT A BIGGER PAW DID THE ACTUAL LIFTING
IZZY WHISTLED AND BEGAN PICKING UP HIS HELMET PREPARING TO GO OUTSIDE
THE KNIFE FELL FROM THE CROOK'S HAND AND THE DARK FACE TURNED PALE
WHY NOT FOR US GORDON HAD BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT PERHAPS SECURITY WAS RIGHT
HE STOPPED FOR A SECOND BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF TROUBLE
SO TRENCH GOT PROMOTED--AND I GOT HIS JOB FOR LOYAL SERVICE IN HELPING THE FORCE RECRUIT
GORDON'S OWN SQUAD WAS EQUIPPED WITH SHIELDS NOW AND THEY WERE DOING BETTER
THEY DUCKED INTO IT WHILE SHE GRABBED THE WHEEL
THERE ARE EVEN CITIES OUT THERE GORDON
HE STARED INTO THE FACE OF ISAIAH TRENCH
THE HUGE MAN SHRUGGED PONDEROUSLY
TRADED HIM AN OLD JOB PRESS AND A BAG OF SCRATCH FOR HIS REPUTATION YOU'LL BE LATE IZZY RANDOLPH SAID QUIETLY
TWO OF THE MEN WERE DROPPING BEFORE THE OTHERS COULD REACH FOR THEIR OWN WEAPONS AND WHILE THE RAT-FACED MAN WAS JUST TURNING
YELL WHEN YOU WANT THEM REMOVED SHE TOOK THE BUNDLES WOODENLY UNTIL SHE CAME TO A PLASTIC CAN
LONG TIME NO SEE
BUT TO USE ONE INSIDE THE DOME WAS UNTHINKABLE
OKAY IT'S YOUR DEATH CERTIFICATE HE SAID AND TURNED BACK TOWARD IZZY
SO YOU PAID IT
GORDON FOUND HIS WAY CLEARED AND SHOT THROUGH EMERGING BEHIND THE DEFENSE AND DRIVING AT FULL SPEED TOWARD THE ENTRANCE IZZY POINTED OUT
ON MARS IT DIDN'T SEEM ODD TO BEGIN APPLYING FOR A POLICE JOB BY CARRYING IN NARCOTICS
SECURITY WAS GOOD AT GETTING PEOPLE IN TROUBLE BUT HE HAD SEEN NO OTHER SIGN OF IT
OUTSIDE HE SNAPPED
HE GRABBED THEM BY THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS THEN AND BROUGHT THE TWO SKULLS TOGETHER SAVAGELY
YOU START OUT ON A LITTLE AND YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY IT DIDN'T AFFECT HONEST IZZY GORDON POINTED OUT
THERE WERE SOUNDS OF STIRRING BUT NO ONE WAS TRUSTING THAT THE ELECTION-DAY BRAWLS WERE COMPLETELY ENDED YET
HE HAD HIS GUN ALMOST UP BEFORE GORDON COULD FIRE
AROUND THE CORNER FATS YELLED
THEY WERE THROUGH TOO FAST TO DRAW FIRE FROM THE BUSY GROUPS OF BATTLE-CRAZED MEN LEAPING ACROSS THE SQUARE AND INTO THE FIRST SIDE STREET THEY COULD FIND
WE'RE GOING TO ARREST WAYNE
THE FOOLS HAD OBVIOUSLY EXPECTED THE MACHINE GUN TO DO ALL THE WORK
IT AIN'T HONEST TREATING US THIS WAY
OF COURSE IF IT'S URGENT PAL GORDON WAS IN NO MOOD TO TRY BRIBES
FEET WERE POUNDING BELOW AS HE FOUND THE ENTRANCE THAT LED TO THE TRUCK
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY WINNING AND NOW HE GOT UP AND CAME OVER TO CASH IN HIS CHIPS
PUT HIM HERE SHE LIFTED THE FRAIL BODY OF THE OLD MAN AND LOWERED HIM ONTO THE FLOOR WITH A STRENGTH THAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
HE THREW IT BACK AND BEGAN STACKING AMMUNITION CASES IN FRONT OF THE DOPE
SO WHAT DO WE GET--WE GET KNIFES IN THE FACES SAPS ON THE HEAD--A CONCUSSION YOU TELL ME
EASY PRINCESS IZZY SAID
HE HAD LESS THAN A HUNDRED CREDITS A KNIFE A DECK OF PHONY CARDS AND A YELLOW TICKET
EVEN IZZY HAD ONE
THE GAMBLING JOINTS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT BEAT COPS HAD TO BE PAID AND CONSIDERED IT PART OF THEIR OPERATING EXPENSE
THEY KICKED ME OFF EARTH ON A YELLOW TICKET IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN YEAH TRENCH SHOVED A LETTER FORWARD
THE CAPTAIN SMILED
NEXT IT'S MURTAGH
HE HAD ONE COP IN HIS LEFT ARM USING HIM AS A FLAIL AGAINST THE OTHERS
TELL THOSE TRAINED APES OF YOURS TO CUT THE LIGHTS WILL YOU MOTHER
FOR A SECOND HIS THOUGHTS CHURNED ON
AS THEY REACHED THE HALL ONE OF TRENCH'S LIEUTENANTS CAME THROUGH THE ENTRANCE WAVING HIS BADGE AT THE PROTESTING MAN OUTSIDE
THE FEW BARS THAT WERE STILL OPEN HAD BEEN BLESSED WITH THE SIGN OF SOME MOB AND OBVIOUSLY WERE WELL STAFFED WITH HOODLUMS READY TO PROTECT THE PROPRIETOR
MOTHER COREY HELD THE WRISTS IN ONE HAND PUT HIS OTHER UNDER THE GIANT'S CROTCH AND LIFTED
TOOK ME TO THE SPACEPORT HANDED ME MY YELLOW TICKET AND SENT ME OFF FOR MARS
THEY HAD STRUCK QUICKLY ACCORDING TO PLANS MADE BY EXPERTS ON EARTH AND NOW CONTROLLED ABOUT HALF OF MARSPORT
BUT THEY WON THEIR FREEDOM AND IT MADE THEM GREAT--SO GREAT THAT NOW THAT ONE NATION--NOT ALL EARTH BUT THAT SINGLE NATION!--IS TRYING TO DO TO US WHAT SHE WOULDN'T PERMIT TO HERSELF
IT MUST BE PRETTY STIFF JUDGING BY THE RELIEF THE MAN WAS SHOWING AT MAKING QUOTA
WE GOT TERRITORY TO COVER A THUMB INDICATED THAT THEY COULD GO IN
HE'D TRIED HONESTY ON HIS BEAT BACK ON EARTH
AND I DON'T LIKE THE STENCH OF THAT KIND OF COP IN MY PLACE
FROM HIS LOOK OF HAVING SLEPT WELL HE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS BOOKED
I HEARD SOMEONE THE WOMAN SAID
ON THE FLOOR A SINGLE LEGAL COP LAY UNDER THE WRECKAGE APPARENTLY HAVING GOTTEN THERE FIRST AND BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY THE LATER MUNICIPALS
DON'T YOU KNOW A WIFE SHOULDN'T KEEP SECRETS FROM HER HUSBAND
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SECURITY CAN DO ANYTHING
NO PLACE HERE FOR AN HONEST COP--NOT WITH ELECTIONS COMING UP COBBER
BELIEVE ME I KNOW
GORDON WAS SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE
A FEW GROUPS DEPENDING ON NUMBERS FOR SAFETY
NO WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT UNDER SOME KIND OF COVERING THE WAY I HAD IT PLANNED IN THE FIRST PLACE ONLY WITH ONE MORE DAMNED COMPLICATION
HE FOUND THE GUN THAT GORDON HAD CONFISCATED FROM O'NEILL AND FILLED IT FROM A BOX OF AMMUNITION HE'D APPARENTLY PURCHASED
AND LUCKY FOR YOU CUDDLES HER HAND STREAKED TO A GUN IN HER BELT
HOW'D YOU GREASE THE FIX GORDON SKETCHED IT IN WITHOUT MENTIONING SECURITY
THEY WOULDN'T DARE DESTROY THE DOME
THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOLVED
THE TRANSPARENT PLASTIC OF THE COVERALLS WENT ON EASILY ENOUGH AND HIS HANDS FOUND THE SEALS QUICKLY
HOW SO
HE WENT FOR THE DOOR KNOCKING HER ASIDE
GUNS GORDON SAID SLOWLY
BUT IN THE END HE DROPPED THE KEY AND HALF HIS MONEY BESIDE HER DOOR ALONG WITH A SPARE KNIFE AND ONE OF HIS GUNS
HE MOVED IN CAUTIOUSLY AS SILENTLY AS HE COULD AND LOCATED THE SEMI-SECRET ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING WITHOUT MEETING ANYONE
THEN HE PAID HIS TOLL FOR THE OPENING OF THE PRIVATE SLIT AND WENT THROUGH INTO THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE DOME
THEY'VE RUINED THE COOP COBBER
FROM SOMEWHERE WETNESS TOUCHED HIS CHEEK
SO THAT'S THE DOPE I BROUGHT OUT EH
THEY JUST MIGHT
THEY NEVER GAVE ANY REAL POWER NEVER WILL
TRENCH HAD HIS GUN OUT NOW AND WAS FIRING AFTER A SINGLE SURPRISED GLANCE AT GORDON
AHEAD OF HIM THE KID LAY SPRAWLED OUT BLOOD TRICKLING FROM AN UGLY BRUISE ALONG HIS JAW
BUT JURGENS WAS ONLY MOMENTARILY OUT
IZZY PRESSED THE SEAL RELEASE AND SLID IN CAUTIOUSLY WHILE THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
YOU TAKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING SERIOUS
GORDON THREW HIMSELF FLAT TO THE FLOOR
HIS FINGERS FOUND THE HALF NOTEBOOK COVER INSTEAD
THEY WANT ME MURDOCH GASPED THICKLY
HE KNOCKED ON THE PANEL UNTIL IT FINALLY OPENED A CRACK
ANYHOW WE'LL GET A BUNCH OF CREDITS FOR THE STUFF WHEN WE TURN IT IN CREDITS GORDON ASKED
HIS HANDSHAKE WAS FIRM AND FRIENDLY
THAT'S HIM--MY HUSBAND
HE GRINNED AND THEN SAW THAT HE'D LIFTED HIS FOOT TO A HIGHER STEP
FINALLY A FEEBLE VOICE SOUNDED FROM INSIDE
MURDOCH TURNED ON HIS HEEL
THE STAR POINT MEN WERE WINNING THOUGH IT WAS TOUGH GOING
AH YES HE TOOK THE SUMS THEY HAD READY--THERE WAS A STANDARD PRICE--AND STAMPED THEIR FORMS
WAR WHAT ELSE
THEN A YELL REACHED HIS EARS AND SOMETHING SWISHED AT HIM
OF COURSE IF I EVER CATCH MYSELF DOING ANYTHING SHADY DURING THE DAY I'LL HAVE TO TURN MYSELF IN
WELL IT'LL GIVE THE BOYS SOMETHING TO DO HE DECIDED
SHE WAS SANDING THE DISHES AND PUTTING THEM AWAY WHEN HE FINALLY REMEMBERED THE RING
A COPYRIGHT RENEWAL COULD NOT BE FOUND LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOGUE CARD NUMBER
THEN THEY WERE IN FRONT OF AN ORNATE DOOR WITH THEIR WEAPONS READY
THEN BRUCE GORDON STOPPED AS GREAT ARMS SURROUNDED HIM
WAYNE SAT PETRIFIED STARING UNBELIEVINGLY AND GORDON DREW OUT THE WARRANT
DONE HE SAID
DO YOU WANT TO SHOOT ME OR WILL YOU FOLLOW ORDERS RANDOLPH PICKED IT UP AND FUMBLED IN HIS POCKET DRAWING OUT A TINY BADGE AND COMPARING THEM
IF YOU CAN FIND ME MAYBE I'LL LISTEN THE TORN-OFF FRONT COVER OF THE NOTEBOOK ACCOMPANIED THE LETTER
AND WHEN THIS STARTS A MAN HAS TO GET THERE FIRST HE PATTED HIS SIDE WHERE A BULGE SHOWED
YOU GUYS EARNED IT BY KEEPING YOUR HANDS OFF IT
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY A SMALL GAMBLING-HOUSE OWNER BUT WITHIN HIS OWN CIRCLE HIS WORDS CARRIED WEIGHT
THEN HE BLINKED
REPORT AND FIND MARS A WORSE PLACE THAN MERCURY COULD EVER BE
SOMETHING TOUCHED HIS HAND AND HE LOOKED DOWN TO SEE HER FINGERS
THEY CALLED IT BUNDLING ONCE I THINK
HE HAD HALF EXPECTED TO FIND IT BARRICADED BUT APPARENTLY THE RUMORS THAT NICK THE CROOP OWNED IT WERE TRUE
YOU BONUSED ME TO PROTECT YOU AND I BLOODY WELL TRIED
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT A VOICE WHINED OUT OF THE DARKNESS
MAYBE YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME BUT THEY CAN BREATHE THE AIR HERE WITHOUT A HELMET THE OTHERS NODDED
THERE WAS NO SENSE IN KILLING THE GEESE THAT LAID THE EGGS
HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR TEN YEARS
AND THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER WAS ATTACHED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK
THE GUN IN HIS HAND PICKED THEM OUT AT QUARTERS TOO CLOSE FOR A MISS STARTING WITH THE COP WHO HAD JUMPED TO CATCH RANDOLPH
GORDON SAW THE BLONDE GIRL ON THE OUTSKIRTS HER FACE TAUT AND GLOWING
BLOOD OOZED FROM A WELT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
I FIGURED IZZY'D STOP BY FIRST
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THEY LEFT IN A BIG TRUCK CAPABLE OF HAULING WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIFTY TONS ON EARTH
THEY GOT SOME MONEY SCRAPED TOGETHER BUT THE HICKS ARE DOING NO BUSINESS WITH MARSPORT
TELL ME LAD DID THEY GET MURDOCH BRUCE GORDON NODDED AND THE OLD MAN SIGHED
I SUPPOSE IT CAN'T BE HELPED THOUGH
THERE WAS A TRAMPLE OF BODIES BUT NO MORE SHOTS
LITTLE GIRLS SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH KNIVES
HE LOOKED UP AND STRAIGHT INTO THE SWINGING MUZZLE OF THE MACHINE GUN THAT HAD STARTED THE COMMOTION
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HIS HOODLUMS HAD BEEN HIRED FOR THE JOB
A SCOOTER PULLED UP ALONGSIDE THEM ALMOST AT ONCE WITH A GUN-CARRYING MOBSTER RIDING IT
HE STEPPED BACKWARDS AND TWISTED
BUT WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART BECAUSE I NEEDED A MEAL TICKET SHE SAID HARSHLY
THEY TRIED TO OUTMANEUVER HIM
NOW SHE JERKED UPRIGHT THEN SANK BACK WITH A SLOW FLUSH
TRENCH
TRENCH
BUT IF YOU GET CAUGHT AGAIN YOU'LL GET STILL WORSE THE SQUAD WENT IN TIRED AND SORE
AND I TOOK QUITE A CHANCE TOO TO SET THIS UP SO NOBODY COULD EVER BELIEVE YOU WERE BEHIND IT
LET'S VOTE IZZY SHOOK HIS HEAD
TRENCH'S EX-MARINE BELLOW CARRIED OVER THE FIGHTING
IT WOULD BE PROTECTED IN OTHER WAYS WITH THE TRUCKS USED FOR STREET FIGHTING IF NEEDED
THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE SEAL HE SPOTTED THEM MOVING TOWARD THE BIG CAR OUTSIDE
IZZY LEAPED FOR THE MACHINE GUN AND YANKED IT FROM DEAD HANDS WHILE THE COPS SLOWLY BEGAN RAISING THEIR ARMS
DAMN IT THERE'S A REBELLION GOING ON GORDON TOLD THE MAN
RANDOLPH SCURRIED OFF TO START SETTING UP HIS MAKESHIFT PLANT IN THE BASEMENT
I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO EARTH AND I'LL TRY TO TAKE YOU ALONG
THEN HE GRIMACED AT HIMSELF
TRENCH WAS A FEW FEET AWAY
GORDON GLANCED AT HIS WATCH FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE SO QUICKLY
GORDON JERKED AROUND BUT WAYNE WAS ALREADY DISAPPEARING THROUGH A HEAVY DOOR
AND BRAWLS AS ONE DRUNKEN CRAZED CROWD MET ANOTHER
HIS EYES DARTED DOWN TO THE POINT OF THE KNIFE THAT SHOWED UNDER GORDON'S SLEEVE AND HE LICKED HIS LIPS SHOWING SNAGGLED TEETH
HE'D ALREADY CAPTURED ONE OF THE PIKES
WITH A YELLOW TICKET AGAIN--BUT WITHOUT ANY RAZZLE-DAZZLE THIS TIME
I TRIED TO GET YOU WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE RUMOR BUT YOU WERE GONE
BRUCE GORDON CAME NEXT SHOWING HIS BADGE
I'LL MAKE IT RIGHT
HE LOOKED DOWN FOR SHEILA BUT SHE WAS GONE
YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT HE OPENED UP A BOX ON HIS DESK AND PULLED OUT SIX HEAVY WOODEN STICKS EACH THIRTY INCHES LONG AND NEARLY TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER
THERE WERE A LOT OF SUCH PREPARATIONS GOING ON FOR THE FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS
YOU FOOLS HE YELLED
THEN HE WENT GUNNING FOR TRENCH WITH SOME IDEA TRENCH HAD SWIPED THE STUFF--SO TRENCH IS NOW RUNNING THE MUNICIPALS
SHE YAWNED AND NODDED FINGERING THE STITCHES THAT STILL RAN DOWN THE BLANKET TO DIVIDE IT
KNIVES THAT'S MY SPECIALTY
THEIR CHESTS WERE ONLY A TRIFLE LARGER AND THEIR HEARTBEAT ONLY A FEW POINTS HIGHER
BUT NOBODY EXCEPT THE ROMANTIC FOOLS HAD EVER THOUGHT FRONTIERS WERE PRETTY
I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW WE OPERATE
BUT YOU'D BETTER GET PRAEGER TO SEND SOMETHING GORDON
THE CAPTAIN NODDED AT GORDON
MAYOR WAYNE FOUND AN OLD CLAUSE IN THE CHARTER AND GOT A RIGGED DECISION PULLING ME BACK UNDER HIS FULL AUTHORITY
SO YOU'RE IT FOR A MOMENT GORDON WONDERED WHAT IZZY HAD DONE TO EARN THAT BEAT BUT HE COULD GUESS
THERE WERE ENOUGH OF THEM MOSTLY BASED ON TRUTH
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ALL THE GANGS WEREN'T WORKING FOR WAYNE'S RE-ELECTION
I'M GETTING OLD COBBERS
HE TURNED TO PUT HIS HEAD DOWN
IT BORE THE OFFICIAL BUSINESS SEAL OF SOLAR SECURITY AND WAS ADDRESSED TO CORPORAL BRUCE GORDON NINETEENTH POLICE PRECINCT MARSPORT
THE IMAGE OF THE OLD WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND IN THE LITTLE LIQUOR STORE WHERE HE'D HAD HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE CAME BACK TO HIM
HIS EARS BARELY DETECTED THE SOUND SHEILA MADE AS SHE REACHED FOR THE KNIFE OF ONE OF THE MEN
HANDS GRABBED AT HIS ARMS AND A CLUB SWUNG DOWN TOWARD HIS KNIFE
I'M LEAVING YOU TWO ABLE TO WALK FOR THAT
THE KID DUCKED DOWN AND OUT OF THE CAR WORMING HIS WAY AROUND THE BUILDING THAT CONCEALED THEM
PLACE IS LOUSY WITH PEOPLE NOW
TOO BAD SECURITY DIDN'T THINK I WAS AS LOUSY A REPORTER AS YOU DO OKAY
IZZY YANKED THE DOOR OPEN AND DROPPED FLAT BEHIND IT
HE CAME ON A PUSHER WORKING ONE OF THE BETTER HOUSES--LONG AFTER HIS COLLECTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER
BUT IF YOU CAN SPARE SOMETHING FOR THE KID--HEY KID A THIN BOY OF ABOUT SIXTEEN CREPT OUT FROM BEHIND SOME RUBBLE STARING UNCERTAINLY
HE SEES A DOCTOR HE BUYS MEDICINE
THE DOME HAD BEEN DOWN A FULL WEEK WHEN HE WATCHED THE LAST OF RANDOLPH'S EQUIPMENT PACKED ONTO A TRUCK AND HAULED AWAY
HE HAD MOVED BACK TOWARD THE WALL TO FACE THE GROUP
I SOLD HER TO THE HEAD OF THE EAST POINT GANG
ARREST OR RESCUE HE ASKED
I'LL WATCH THEM A VOICE SAID FROM THE DOOR
WE NEVER GOT A TOP MAN HERE WITHOUT HIS BEING DISCOVERED AND KILLED--THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD TO WORK UNDER ALL THE COVER--AND AGAINST OUR OWN GOVERNMENT
SHE CAST A GLANCE BACK HESITATED AND THEN BEGAN TO MOVE OFF
HE PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY HOWEVER REALIZING THAT IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE SHEILA TO AMBUSH HIM
YOU'D THINK THEY'D LOSE COUNT ONCE IN A WHILE HE COMPLAINED TO HIS COMPANION
HE TOSSED HER OVER HIS SHOULDER AND STARTED DOWN THE RICKETY STAIRS
YOU'LL NEED THE BRAINS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE OTHERS--BUT THEY CAN'T ACT
HE'D LIKED ASA MURDOCH HAD BEGUN TO RESPECT HIM
BUT LATER AS HE STOOD BESIDE THE DOME WHEN NIGHT HAD FALLEN AGAIN GORDON WASN'T SO SURE
MEN BEGAN PILING OUT OF THE BACK BEFORE IT STOPPED--MEN ARMED WITH CLUBS AND STONES
IZZY WAS ACTING AS CHIEF OF POLICE SCHULBERG WAS HEAD OF THE RECONSTRUCTION CORPS AND MOTHER COREY WAS TEMPORARY MAYOR OF ALL MARSPORT
TOP LEVEL--POLICY FOR MARS
I DON'T KNOW HIS SCREAMS WERE ALMOST WORSE THAN THE BEATING BUT NAMES BEGAN TO COME
OKAY SHEILA HE CALLED OUT TRYING TO MUFFLE HIS VOICE
AT THIS HOUR THOUGH MOST OF THE PLACE WAS EMPTY
IT WASN'T POOR ENOUGH TO OFFER THE UNIVERSAL DESPERATION THAT GAVE THE GANG HOODLUMS PROTECTIVE COLORING NOR RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE MAJOR RACKETS OF ITS OWN
EARTH WANTS TO TAKE OVER IT SHOULD GORDON SAID
DAMN IT MARS COULD BE CLEANED UP
THAT ONE HAS MY NAME ON IT AND RATING AS A PRIME
LUCKY DEVIL
CAME UP FROM EARTH EIGHT YEARS AGO LOOKING FOR ME
THE OLD LADY LOOKED THEN MOVED QUICKLY TO THE OTHER SIDE
BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE SWITCHED TO A NEW BEAT WHERE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THICKEST AND GIVEN TWELVE-HOUR DUTY--WITHOUT SPECIAL OVERTIME
SO JURGENS IS BEHIND IT
WE'VE ALREADY CHASED ALL YOUR BOARDERS OUT GORDON TRIED TO REMEMBER WHICH STEPS HAD CREAKED THE WORST BUT HE WASN'T TOO WORRIED IF THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THEM
TOMORROW HE'D FIND SOME KIND OF AN ANSWER
HE LIKES YOU BRUCE
THEN A MAN JUMPED FOR HIM SWINGING A PIKE AND THE FEELING WAS SUDDENLY GONE
BUT NOT SO OLD THAT I CAN'T HANDLE A COUPLE OF GUARDS THAT ARE STUBBORN ABOUT TRUCKS EH IZZY MESSY BUT NICE IZZY AGREED FROM THE PILE ABOVE THEM
LOOK YOU NEVER WERE A REPORTER--YOU RAN A COLUMN
HIS DARK SCOWLING FACE AND LEAN BODY STILL BORE A MILITARY AIR
HE WOULDN'T TALK WITH US MUCH
THEN HE NODDED
AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO ORDER YOU OUT THERE WARD THREE WAS THE HANGOUT OF A CHEAP GANG OF HOODLUMS NUMBERING SOME FOUR HUNDRED WHO WENT IN FOR SMALL CRIMES MOSTLY
HERE THERE WERE LESS SIGNS OF TROUBLE
HE WONDERED HOW WELL BARRICADED THEY WERE
HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AS SHE REACHED FOR A CUP OF COFFEE AND HANDED IT TO HIM LISTENING TO HIS QUICK REPORT OF RANDOLPH'S SAFETY AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS GOING BACK OUTSIDE THE DOME
ALL RIGHT CORPORAL GORDON
AND THERE WOULD BE NO COPS
LOOKING FOR A ROOM HE WHINED
THERE WAS NOTHING PHONY THIS TIME AS SHE HIT THE FLOOR
IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR OF HARD WORK TO LOAD THE LAST OF THEM AND TRENCH WAS WORKING HARDER THAN THEY WERE
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO REACH THE BATTERY AND DROP ANY METAL ACROSS THE TWO TERMINALS THERE--IF THEY COULD GET BACK BEFORE TRENCH--AND SHEILA--COULD REMOVE THE BATTERY
HIS HEAD WAS EMPTIED FOR THE MOMENT AND HE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN A CHANCE TO HIT THE BED AND FORGET THE WHOLE BUSINESS UNTIL MORNING
HE REVERSED THE CONTROL
THERE WAS BOTH GRATITUDE AND RESENTMENT AS SHE LOOKED UP AT GORDON
THE DRUG KILLED PAIN BUT ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF A TEMPORARY PARALYSIS OF ALL VOLUNTARY MOTION
EH
HE PITCHED THE GIANT OUT OVERHANDED
HE FOUND HIS OWN ROOM AND TURNED IN AUTOMATICALLY
THERE WERE FEWER PEOPLE OUTSIDE
APPARENTLY THERE WAS STILL POWER FLOWING IN FROM THE AUTOMATIC ATOMIC GENERATORS
FIFTY PER CENT OF THE TAKE TO THE ORPHAN'S AND WIDOW'S FUND
OTHER GUNS BEGAN FIRING
THEN THE KID'S VOICE ROSE SHARPLY TO A YELL
WANT ME TO DROP YOU OFF THEY WANGLED THE BODY INTO THE TRUNK OF THE CAR
BUT GORDON KNEW NOW THAT HE COULD NEVER HOPE TO GET BACK TO EARTH LEGALLY
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION COULD NEVER WIN ANOTHER ELECTION
AND GORDON HAD BEEN PROUD TO SERVE UNDER MURDOCH
AS THEY MOVED OUT HE SAW THE SLOW CHANGE FROM THE BEATEN APPEARANCE OF MARSPORT TO SOMETHING THAT SEEMED NO WORSE THAN WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE SHARE-CROPPERS BACK ON EARTH
I GOT A JOB TODAY--BARMAID ON YOUR BEAT WHERE BEING YOUR WIFE HELPS HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY TO IT
YOU ALL RIGHT BRUCE
YOU'RE A SERGEANT ALREADY
A SLIT OPENED AND CLOSED
GORDON YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR HIS VOICE WAS BITTER BUT HE MADE NO OPENING FOR THEM TO QUESTION HIM AS HE PICKED UP THE PAPERS AND BEGAN GOING THROUGH THEM AGAIN
THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THE SUDDEN VIGILANCE INSIDE THE DOME
IZZY EXPLAINED IT
AS A FINAL THOUGHT HE PICKED UP THE STOUT LOCUST STICK HE'D USED UNDER MURDOCH
BUT HE REACHED THE EXIT FROM THE DOME WITH NO TROUBLE
GORDON ROLLED OUT OF HER SWING AND BROUGHT HIS FOOT UP
HE FINISHED THE MEAL ACCEPTED A PACK OF THE EARTH CIGARETTES THAT SOLD AT A LUXURY PRICE HERE AND WENT OUT INTO THE THIN AIR OF MARS
BUT THIS MAKES YOU MY BOSS THEN GIVE IT ALL THE PUBLICITY YOU CAN AND TELL THEM SECURITY HAS JUST DECLARED WAR ON THE WHOLE DAMNED DOME SECTION
AMAZEMENT KEPT HIM MOTIONLESS FOR A SECOND
GORDON AND IZZY FOUND THE LEAD TRUCK AND LED THE WAY
ONLY THE RAT AND THE APE WERE STANDING NEAR A HEAVY CLOSED DOOR
IN THE STREET SHE COULD LOSE HERSELF IN THE SWARM OF NICK'S CROOPSTERS
THE THREE GOT OFF
GORDON CONFISCATED THE MONEY
THEY HAD THE NAMES OF NEARLY ALL OF THEM AND SOME PRETTY GOOD IDEAS OF THEIR HIDE-OUTS
I SENT APE AND MULLINS OUT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU JURGENS SAID
GOV'NOR THE WORD BARELY REACHED HIM AND BRUCE GORDON SPUN AROUND THE KNIFE TWITCHING INTO HIS HAND
LIGHTS
LET THEM BRIBE US IF THEY LIKE
JUST STAY THERE UNTIL I GET AWAY FROM THIS RAT'S NEST AND I WON'T HIT YOU
THEN ANOTHER COP CAME AROUND A CORNER AT A RUN
FOR THE SIGHT OF THESE I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAY FOR YOUR PITCH
HE TRIED TO REACH HER WITH A THROWN CLUB WRESTED FROM ANOTHER MAN BUT SHE LEAPED NIMBLY ASIDE SHOUTING COMMANDS
THEN HE SCOOPED IT UP AND NODDED
HE WAS FINALLY FORCED TO STOP AGAIN SURE THAT HE WAS NEAR NOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU RUSTY
RISKING YOUR LIFE JUST TO GO INTO MARSPORT
THE NOLAN MAN WAS PROTESTING
RICH BUT NOT VERY IMAGINATIVE HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
HIS EYES SWUNG TOWARD THE STREET WHILE GORDON ATTACKED THE ROPE AROUND HIS ANKLES
THEY'LL BE CALLING ME GRANDMOTHER PRETTY SOON
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF SHEILA THIS TIME AND HE DIDN'T LOOK FOR HER
HE AWOKE TO FIND IZZY SHAKING HIS SHOULDER
HIS BUNK HAD BEEN CHANGED TO A WIDER ONE AND SHE LAY UNDER THE THIN COVERING ON ONE SIDE
NOW I WANT THAT DAMNED BOOK
THE HEAVY LOCUST STICK MET THE MAN'S WRIST BEFORE THE WEAPON WAS HALF DRAWN--ANOTHER GUN
SORRY MY MAN DREW THAT KNIFE ON YOU THE LAST TIME CORPORAL GORDON ROLLED AN EIGHT POCKETED THE BILLS AND SHRUGGED
FINE FINE GORDON'S NAME CAME AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
MARSPORT HAD HIRED A MAN FROM EARTH TO COME IN AND ACT AS CHIEF OF THE SECTION
DEAD GORDON SAID TO THE WOMAN AS SHE CAME UP WITH THE TWINE
I'LL GIVE YOU A JOB FOR ONE WEEK
HE STILL CALLED ME SIR WHEN MY BOY WAS WALKING ACROSS THE STREET SO THE LAD WOULDN'T KNOW THEY WERE SENDING ME AWAY
I GUESS THE CITIZENS LIKE YOU THE WAY THEY TREAT YOU HE LAUGHED AT HIS STALE JOKE AND GORDON WAS WILLING TO LAUGH WITH HIM
GET YOUR MONEY PUNK AND GET OUT
THE HOODLUMS TOSSED THE MAN ASIDE EASILY AND LET OUT A YELL
BUT JUST REMEMBER YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING
HELL I FIGURED BRUCE WOULD DO THE SAME
HIS EYES COVERED THE STREET IN TWO QUICK SCANS
IT WASN'T THE DAY TO COLLECT THE TIPS FOR GOOD SERVICE WHICH HAD BEEN AN HONEST ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE GOOD POLICE SERVICE BEFORE IT BECAME A RACKET
THE CHANGE WAS FINISHED--AND HE FELT LIKE A GROWN MAN PLAYING WITH DOLLS
RANDOLPH GRINNED CROOKEDLY
AT LEAST SOME MEN ARE LOYAL
WE'LL BE ALONG LATER HE GRABBED RANDOLPH'S HAND AND DUCKED OUT THE BACK BEFORE GORDON COULD PROTEST
THEN HE LOOKED UP AT THEM
CONGRATULATIONS BY THE WAY
THERE WAS NONE
SHE TURNED TOWARD HER ROOM THEN HESITATED AS HE GRINNED CROOKEDLY AT HER
AND HE'D HAD PRACTICE
THEN BEFORE HE COULD LIFT HIMSELF SHE BENT OVER AND BEGAN UNFASTENING HIS BOOTS
GORDON BROUGHT HIS UP THE EXTRA HALF INCH AIMING BY THE FEEL AND PULLED THE TRIGGER
THIRTY PIECES ONE FOR EACH YEAR OF HIS LIFE
THE RAID WAS OVER AND THE LEGALS HAD LOST
THEY HAVEN'T SHOWN A HAND YET THEY WILL PRAEGER SAID
HE GULPED HALF OF IT BEFORE HE REALIZED IT HAD BEEN NEEDLED WITH ETHER
HER VOICE WAS UNCERTAIN
GORDON RIFLED THE HOOD'S POCKETS AND LOCATED A ROLL OF BILLS STUFFED IN
BRUCE GORDON RECOGNIZED ONE AS RANDOLPH THE PUBLISHER OF THE LITTLE OPPOSITION PAPER
THEY WERE COVERING AN AREA OF SIX BLOCKS ONE WAY AND TWO THE OTHER
THEY HE TURNED SAW IT WAS GORDON AND HIS FACE TURNED BLANK
BUT HE'D SEEN IT TOO
YOU'LL HAVE CIVIL WAR AND THE WHOLE PLANETARY DEVELOPMENT RUINED
FINALLY HE SHRUGGED
AND BY EVENING THE STONEWALL BOYS HAD RECEIVED PROOF THAT IT DIDN'T PAY TO GO AGAINST THE POLICE IN LARGE NUMBERS
THE OTHER WAS PROBABLY ALSO ONE OF JURGENS GROWING MOB OF PROTECTION RACKETEERS
IT WASN'T NECESSARY NOW
FROM THE BUILDINGS AROUND AN ASSORTMENT OF TOUGHS CAME AT THE DOUBLE SWINGING KNIVES PICKS AND BLUDGEONS
YOU GET THINGS DONE
SHE STARTED UP TO HELP HIM THEN JERKED BACK AND TURNED HER HEAD AWAY
THE OLDER MAN KEPT TRYING TO STOP TO SPEAK BUT GORDON GAVE HIM NO OPPORTUNITY
A RESPECTABLE LANDLORD HAS TO PROTECT HIMSELF IZZY
HE REALLY TAPPED THEM
OTHER THINGS WERE WORSE
I'LL WALK
I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE MOVED UP THE FRONT STEPS AND THROUGH THE BATTERED SEAL
LOOK YOU'VE BEEN ON OVERTIME ALL WEEK
LITTLE ONES FOR THE TWO YEARS HE'D WASTED AS A COP
HE KNEW IT WAS NO ANSWER BUT ASA MURDOCH APPARENTLY ACCEPTED IT AS A PROMISE
THANKS GOV'NOR THE KID SAID STOWING THEM AWAY
HE CLIMBED OUT JUST AS THE TWO GROUPS MET
MEN BEGAN SPEWING OUT OF THE BRAWL LIKE STRAW FROM A THRESHER AS THE OLD MAN GRABBED ARMS LEGS OR WHATEVER WAS HANDY
THEY MIGHT DO IT GORDON
NO SHE TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR AS HE PUSHED UP FROM THE BED BUT HIS ARM CAUGHT HER WRIST DRAGGING HER BACK
IF THEY WANT TO COLLECT THAT DRATTED PLEDGE OF THEIRS LET THEM PUT ME WHERE I CAN MAKE IT
IZZY WENT OUT AND GORDON STOOD STARING AT THE WALL
WE'VE GOT TO ROUND UP WHATEVER GROUP WE CAN AND GET THEM BACK HERE ON THE DOUBLE
GORDON MOVED AUTOMATICALLY TOWARD THE SEVENTH WARD
PICK UP THE SNOW TOO THE PUSHER'S FACE PALED
TRENCH IS OUTSIDE IN A HEAVY-ARMORED CAR BRUCE
JET ME
THE AIRSEAL WAS FILTHY AND THERE WAS NO BELL
OKAY HONEY HE'S THE JOE OUT OF THE DARKNESS TEN TO A DOZEN FIGURES LOOMED UP
HIS DOOR OPENED AND THERE WAS THE SOUND OF TWO MEN CROSSING THE ROOM ONE WITH THE HEAVY SHUFFLE OF MOTHER COREY
THE OTHER COP HAD YANKED OUT O'NEILL'S WALLET AND NOW TOSSED IT TO GORDON
AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS ON MARS HIS LEGS WERE STILL HARDENED TO EARTH GRAVITY AND HE HAD MORE THAN A DOUBLE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHERS
ABOUT A TENTH OF WHAT HE HAD WON--NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO OPEN A CHEAP POKER DEN LET ALONE BRIBE HIS WAY BACK TO EARTH
SHE WHIMPERED ONCE THEN SHRIEKED FAINTLY AS HIS HAND CAUGHT THE BUTTONS ON THE DRESS JERKING THEM OFF
THE LEGALS GOT THIS PRECINCT LAST NIGHT
THERE WAS A SHAPED GRIP ON EACH WITH A THONG OF LEATHER TO HOLD IT OVER THE WRIST
A HUNDRED FEET FARTHER ON AND WITHIN TWENTY YARDS OF THE TRUCKS A SWISHING RUSTLE REACHED HIS EARS AND LIGHT SLASHED HOTLY INTO HIS EYES
CITIZENS WERE APPEARING ON THE STREETS AT NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS
HE COULDN'T WORK UP ANY GREAT SYMPATHY FOR ANYONE WHO MADE A LIVING OUT OF DRUGS
THEN HE GRINNED WRYLY AND CAME BACK TOWARD GORDON
THEN HE STOPPED AND GOT OUT CAREFULLY WITH HIS HANDS UP
ISAACS WE'RE HOLDING A LITTLE MEETING SO WAIT AROUND
WE'RE IN ENEMY TERRITORY HE SAID
WE'D BETTER GET OUT A BLOCK UP AND WALK
NO BRUCE
SLOWLY PAINFULLY THE LITTLE MAN COUNTED STACKS OF CHIPS AND MOVED THEM ACROSS THE TABLE TOWARD GORDON HIS HANDS TREMBLING
NOW GET OUT OF THIS DISTRICT OR GET HONEST JOBS
GORDON'S ARMS JERKED UPWARDS TO AVOID THE REACHING HANDS
THERE WAS THE SOUND OF THE LOCK BEING WORKED AND THEN SILENCE
AND TIME'S VALUABLE AIN'T IT
IF THEY DON'T YOU'LL KNOW THEY'RE LYING
I'M ASSIGNED HERE IZZY AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER WEEK UNTIL AFTER ELECTIONS BETTER TAKE HIM UP GORDON MURDOCH TOLD HIM BITTERLY
ALL POLICE AND OFFICERS WHO REMAIN LOYAL TO THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THEIR PRESENT GRADE OR HIGHER
THEN HIS HEAD PROJECTED ABOVE THE TOP STEP AND HE HESITATED
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND HE SAID
YOU WERE SOUSED I HEAR--BUT YOUR WIFE GUESSED ENOUGH TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF COMING TO ME WHEN SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED
THE NUMBER OF MUGGINGS AND HOLDUPS IN THE SECTION WAS GOING DOWN
I LIED TO YOU ABOUT USING IT TO MAKE YOU KEEP ME YOU BURNED IT HE TURNED IT OVER STARING AT HER
BUT TODAY THEY WERE DRIFTING OUT UNHAPPILY AS IF ALREADY SURE THERE WOULD BE NO JOBS BY NIGHTFALL
AND THERE WERE SMILES--HUNGRY BEATEN SMILES BUT STILL GENUINE ONES--FOR THE COPS
HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL SHINER WHERE A STONE HAD CLIPPED HIM
GORDON WENT UP THE STAIRS NOTICING THAT IZZY'S DOOR WAS OPEN
AT THE DOOR TO THE HALL HE HESITATED STARING AT SHEILA'S ROOM
A LOT DON'T WANT TO PRAEGER SAID
I DID--ONCE
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BOOK YOU AND YOUR MEN MR JURGENS THE HEAVY LEADER OF THE TWO ANGRY KNIFE-MEN GRINNED
SURPRISINGLY WAYNE HAD FOUND THE COURAGE TO IGNORE THEM
BRUCE GORDON COULD NEVER HAVE COME INTO THE HALLWAY WITHOUT BEING SEEN IN THE OLD DAYS
I'LL BRING HENDRIX TRENCH'S SYSTEM MADE SOME SENSE AND THIS BUSINESS OF MARCHING AS TO WAR MADE NONE AT ALL
THEN SHE SLOWED AND HEADED FOR THE MAIN STREET BACK TO LEGAL TERRITORY
THE GIANT OPENED HIS MOUTH AND TOOK HALF A STEP FORWARD
HE'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO BE IN UNIFORM
HIS FIST HIT THE THUG IN THE ELBOW JUST AS THE MAN'S HAND REACHED FOR HIS KNIFE
AGAIN THERE WAS THE SIGHT OF CHILDREN RUNNING AROUND WITHOUT HELMETS
FATS AND THE OTHER SWUNG JUST IN TIME TO SEE A BIT OF DUST WHERE IT HAD HIT
IZZY CONSIDERED IT SLOWLY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I'VE GOT ME A FARM UP NORTH
BEHIND THE SCREEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF CLOTHES AND A DRESS CAME SAILING FROM BEHIND IT
SHE DUMPED A HEADACHE POWDER INTO HER PALM AND HELD IT OUT HANDING HIM A SMALL GLASS OF WATER
NOT A GOOD CHANCE THEN--BUT A CHANCE
FIRST TIME HE ASKED
YEARS AGO I HAD A FLASK OF POISON GAS ATTACHED IN CASE A GANG SHOULD EVER SQUEEZE ME OUT IN THE FILTHY ROOMS ABOVE GORDON FOUND THE CORPSES--ABOUT FIFTEEN OF THEM AND SOME FORMER MEMBERS OF THE JURGENS ORGANIZATION
BE BAD AND THE DOME'LL COLLAPSE
GORDON GRABBED THE PHONE FROM UNDER THE DASH
THEY DREW BACK THEN MADE A CONCERTED RUSH
I FAILED PAPPA
THEN TRENCH MOTIONED BRUCE GORDON FORWARD AND DISMISSED IZZY WITH A NOD OF HIS HEAD
MOTHER COREY WAS IMMACULATE THOUGH NOT MUCH PRETTIER
A GOOD THING FOR ME TOO MAYBE GORDON BLINKED ACCEPTING THE OTHER'S HAND
WITHOUT TELLING COBBER GORDON LIKE I SAY HONESTY PAYS MOTHER--WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO COLLECT
EVEN WITH GUNS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE IF EARTH SENT A FORCE OF ANY STRENGTH TO BACK SECURITY
HE GROANED THEN LOOKED FRANTICALLY FOR THE PUFF OF ESCAPING AIR
GORDON SPUN AND THE GUN LEAPED IN HIS HANDS WHILE THE SUBMACHINE GUN JERKED FORWARD AND CLICKED ON AN EMPTY CHAMBER
TOO BAD TRENCH GOT TORN TO BITS BY THE MOB ISN'T IT
HE WAITED THEN DREW HIS KNIFE AND BEGAN PRYING AT THE WORN CEMENT AROUND THE AIRSEAL LOOKING FOR THE LOCK THAT HAD BEEN THERE
THAT DAY THE WHOLE FORCE WORKED OVERTIME HUNTING FOR THE MEN WHO HAD ESCAPED
BE AT MOTHER COREY'S SOON THE FAT LITTLE DRUMMER BABBLED ON
FIFTY GALLONS OF WATER ALL WASTED HE TURNED BACK TOWARD THE END OF THE HALL SIGHING AGAIN
THERE'S A PLACE ABOUT TEN BLOCKS BACK
THEN A NEW VOICE CUT INTO THE FRACAS AND THERE WAS THE SOUND OF SOMETHING LANDING AGAINST A SKULL WITH A HOLLOW THUD
THEN GORDON WAS IN THE LITTLE BOOTH
I THOUGHT I HAD FULL RESPONSIBILITY TO EARTH BUT HE'S GOT ME
FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET A GROUP OF SMALL CARS APPEARED
THEN HE GRIMACED
HOW COME YOU'RE WALKING BEAT ANYHOW
THEN IF THE GAMING TABLES HERE WERE AS CRUDELY RUN AS AN OLDTIMER HE'D KNOWN ON EARTH HAD SAID HE COULD TRY A COUP
I HAD ODDS YOU'D BEAT THE TICKET THOUGH THE MOTHER AND ME WERE WORRIED THERE FOR A WHILE
GORDON SIDE-STEPPED HER RUSH AND MET THE OTHER TWO HEAD-ON HIS KNIFE SWINGING BACK
AND HE COMES FOR HIS PROTECTION
BETWEEN TIMES THEY PICKED UP WHAT THEY COULD BY MUGGING AND THEFT WITH A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF MURDER THROWN IN AT A MODEST PRICE
GORDON RODE BACK IN THE OFFICIAL CAR WITH MURDOCH AND BOTH WERE SILENT MOST OF THE WAY
HE WAITED UNTIL THE TWO TURNED UNCERTAINLY UP THE STREET AND TOSSED IT
NOTHING ABOUT THAT IN THE PLEDGE AND WHEN YOU SIGN SOMETHING YOU GOTTA PAY IT
THERE WERE NO RIFLES OPPOSED TO HIM AS HE HAD EXPECTED AND THE GUARD AT THE GATE WAS NO HEAVIER
THEN IT CAME--THE FAINTEST CATCH OF BREATH
SOMETHING LANDED ON HIS BACK AND FINGERNAILS WERE GOUGING INTO HIS FACE SEARCHING FOR HIS EYES
I WAS COMING TO ASK WHETHER YOU HAD ROOM IN YOUR DIGGINGS FOR A GUEST--AND I'M HOPING NOW THAT MY PART HERE CINCHES IT MURDOCH HAD TRIED TO TREAT IT LIGHTLY BUT GORDON SAW THE RED CREEPING UP INTO THE MAN'S FACE
THEN WITH A JERK HE WAS UP
FINALLY HE GOT UP AND HEADED FOR HIS ROOM A LITTLE SURPRISED TO FIND THE DOOR UNLOCKED
SOMEBODY MUST BE USING THE COOP THEY STOPPED THE TRUCK BEFORE REACHING THE OLD WRECK
CARRYING THE BIG FIGURE OFF THE FLOOR THE OLD MAN MOVED TOWARD THE SEAL
IT STOPPED AND THE SPEAKER BEGAN OPERATING
I FIGURED ON LAYING LOW FOR A WHILE THEN OPENING UP A FEW ROOMS FOR A GOOD PUSHER OR TWO MAYBE A HIGH-CLASS DUCHESS
THERE ARE SOME REFUSE BAGS TOO
BUT THE OLD MAN ONLY NODDED AFTER HEARING THAT RANDOLPH WAS SAFE
YES
CLOSED MY BAR BEEN LIVING SORT OF HAND TO MOUTH BUT NOT MUCH MOUTH HIS EYES BULGED GREEDILY AS SHE DUG INTO A BAG AND BEGAN TO DRAG OUT THE SANDWICHES SHE MUST HAVE PACKED FOR THE TRIP
HE GLANCED BACK AT FATS WHO HAD STARTED TO TURN AGAIN
ALL YOUNG CIVILIZATIONS MAKE MISTAKES
THEN A HUGE TRUCK WITH A SPEAKER ON TOP DROVE INTO THE STRUGGLING GROUP AND THE THIN WHISPER OF UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS REACHED GORDON
I DIDN'T START THE RUSH
DAMN GOOD THING WE WERE RIGHT
THEN HE GRIMACED AND SHOVED THE OPEN CAN BACK IN ITS CASE
THEY HAD DRIVEN STRAIGHT TO THE HUGE BARNLIKE EMPLOYMENT BUREAU HAD CHASED OUT THE FEW PEOPLE REMAINING THERE AND HAD SIMPLY TAKEN OVER
THEN HER HANDS WERE GENTLE AS SHE HELPED LOWER MURDOCH WHERE THE CORPSE HAD BEEN
ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH--THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER-THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
OH BOTHER THE SOFT SOAP
GORDON FOLLOWED HIM STARING AT THE SURROUNDING FILTH
A SCARED MAN'S ABILITY TO GET HIS GUN STUCK IN A SIMPLE HOLSTER WAS ALWAYS AMAZING
IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT
TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE DOME WHERE MOTHER COREY'S PLACE WAS THE NARROWER STREETS WERE FILLING WITH THE GANGS ALREADY HALF-DRUNK AND MARCHING ABOUT WITH THEIR BANNERS AND PRINTED SIGNS
YET IT WAS SURPRISING HOW MUCH HE HAD COUNTED ON IT
MURDOCH FELL IN STEP WITH HIM
NOT THAT YOU DESERVE IT LAY OFF MOTHER IZZY SAID SHARPLY
BUT HE HAD ENOUGH FOR A TIME WITHOUT THAT
THE DAMNED FOOLS YEAH
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE ME NOW
GORDON HAD NEVER SEEN GROUP STARVATION BEFORE
ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND I RETIRE TO IT
THE DOOR SLAMMED BEHIND HIM A BEAM SNAPPED OUT FROM HIS FLASHLIGHT INTO THE ALLEY AND THEN HE WAS BESIDE MURDOCH'S BODY
HOPE THEY DON'T GIVE US TOO BAD TERRITORY GOV'NOR HE REMARKED
THE SCATTERING OF LAST-MINUTE SHOPPERS ALONG THE STREETS SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE CITIZENS WERE LAYING IN SUPPLIES TO LAST UNTIL AFTER ELECTION
BLOODY FOOL HAD NO BUSINESS STARTING WITHOUT LINING THE GROOVE
HE GRIMACED GRATEFUL THAT THE SUPERCHARGER ON HIS AIRSUIT FILTERED OUT SOME OF THE SMELL WHICH THE THIN AIR CARRIED
THERE WAS A SUDDEN WITHDRAWAL OF THE COOLING TOUCH ON HIS FOREHEAD AND THEN HASTY STEPS THAT WENT AWAY FROM HIM AND THE SOUND OF A DOOR CLOSING
THE MAIN BODY WENT DOWN THE STREET WAVING FLUORESCENT SIGNS WHILE SIDE-GUARDS PRECEDED THEM ARMED WITH AXES KNOCKING ASIDE THE FLIMSIER BARRICADES AS THEY WENT
HERE THEY GROW UP UNDER THE SHADOW OF IT
THE MAN WHO HAD JUST PASSED WAS CARRYING A LUNCH BASKET AND WAS WEARING THE COVERALLS OF ONE OF THE CROP-PROSPECTOR CREWS
I DUNNO
I DUNNO
THE ONLY QUESTION THAT COUNTED WAS HOW HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE TO RIDE OUT THE STORM AND TO GET BACK TO EARTH AND A NORMAL LIFE
EVEN AFTER HE ARRANGED TO PAY HIS INCOME TAX AND TURNED OVER HIS DONATION TO THE FUND GORDON WAS WELL AHEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE'D LANDED HERE
FOR ONCE HE'D HAD MORE THAN HIS FILL OF IT
COLLECTIONS WERE GOOD ALL WEEK--PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF IZZY'S ACTIONS
BUT HERE IF IT WAS LIKE PLACES HE'D KNOWN ON EARTH EVEN SECOND-HAND CONTACT WITH MUSCLE WAS USEFUL
BUT GORDON SAW ONE OF THE BARTENDERS PAYING MONEY TO A THICKSET PERSON WITH AN ARROGANT SNEER
RUSTY HI PRINCESS HE GOT UP SLOWLY TRYING TO GRIN
HE'S OLD HE CAN'T HANDLE THE CASES
THE MOTHER OBVIOUSLY KNEW SOMETHING
FAILURE TO OBSERVE DUTY WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT TO MERCURY HE SWORE COLDLY AND METHODICALLY WHILE HIS STOMACH DUG KNOTS IN ITSELF
THERE WAS A GRUNT OF PAIN
THERE'S A CODE MESSAGE I HAD READY--A MESSAGE TO A FRIEND--EVEN YOU CAN SEND IT
OKAY MEN LET'S GO BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM
I KNOW
AT CURRENT PRICES IT WOULD BARELY KEEP THEM IN FOOD FOR A WEEK
AND HE'D BECOME SENSITIVE TO THE VOICE OF THE CITY AFTER THE RELATIVE QUIET OF THE NINETEENTH PRECINCT
BUT SHE'LL COME AROUND TO WHERE I'M PROUD OF HER YET
MURDOCH WAS BEING GIVEN THE BUSINESS FOR GOING TOO FAR ON THE STONEWALL GANG NOT FOR REFUSING TO TAKE NORMAL GRAFT
HE HEARD HER COMING DOWN THE OLD STAIRS AND DUCKED OUT THROUGH THE PRIVATE EXIT SNAPPING HIS HELMET IN PLACE AS HE WENT THROUGH THE SEAL
SAVES TROUBLE UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO IT YOURSELF HE SUGGESTED
THIS TIME IT WAS IN WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MAJOR SHIPPING CENTER IN THE HEART OF THE LINES THAT RAN HELTER-SKELTER FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE
AND LISTEN I'M LISTENING WITH YOUR MIND GORDON NOT YOUR EARS
OH FELL GORDON LATIVSKY--STICK AROUND
HE WAS IN NO POSITION TO MOVE ACCORDING TO RIGHT AND WRONG
AFTER ALL SHE'S YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER SO SHE IS
THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN
NOW THERE WAS A SIGN IN FRONT WHICH SIMPLY SAID MARSPORT LEGAL POLICE FORCE HEADQUARTERS
HE'D BEEN IN TWICE AND HAD LIFTED THE GRAFT TAKE BY A TRULY REMARKABLE FIGURE
NOBODY WENT UP TO THEM AND NOBODY CAME FROM THEM
LOOK YOU WANT FOOD WE WANT TO SHIP
IT STRUCK THE WALL NEAR THE CORNER SAILED ON AND STRUCK AGAIN AT THE EDGE OF THE UNPAVED STREET WITH A MUFFLED SOUND
THE TWO MEN TRUDGED ALONG SILENTLY
OKAY YOU'VE DONE YOUR NIGHTLY DUTY
HIS FINGERS WERE STILL STIFF AS HE BEGAN TEARING OFF THE THIN COVERING WITH HIS KNIFE
HE WON'T BELIEVE YOU IF I TAKE YOU IN
GORDON LEFT HIS TORCH UNLIGHTED AND MOVED ALONG
THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE--NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
SUPPLIES WERE SCARCE SALT AND SUGAR ALMOST UNAVAILABLE
MUST BE THIRTY YEARS BUT I'D KNOW ASA MURDOCH ANYWHERE
THE COLD WENT AWAY TO BE REPLACED BY SHOCK
IT WAS CHANGED
GUESS WHAT GOV'NOR
AND HENDRIX CAME CHARGING UP HIS MEN STRAGGLING BEHIND HIM
SO NOW YOU KNOW
HAD TO BE BIG TO FIT ME YOU MEAN YOU HID TRENCH OUT TOO IZZY ASKED
HARWICK HE FINISHED THE ROLL AND SETTLED BACK SMILING
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A GRANDDAUGHTER IZZY SNORTED AND MOTHER COREY GRINNED WOLFISHLY
IN TEN SECONDS THINGS BEGAN TO HAZE OVER BUT HIS ARMS WENT ON MECHANICALLY SEEKING THE MOST DAMAGE THEY COULD WORK
THE BOYS OUT IN WARD THREE ARE SHORTHANDED
FATS COULDN'T TOUCH HIM IN A COMPETITOR'S PLACE
GORDON HAD JUST TIME TO STRAIGHTEN UP BEFORE THE DOORWAY WAS FILLED WITH TWO KNIFE-MEN AND A HEAVIER ONE BEHIND THEM
YOU'RE GOING BYE-BYE CUDDLES HE TOLD HER
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM CAREFULLY SETTLED BACK AND SMILED
GORDON MURDOCH SAID FAINTLY
A MAN NAMED FELL SHOOK HIS HEAD FEARFULLY
IZZY STOPPED HIM
SWEAT POPPED OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD BUT HIS EYES NEVER LEFT GORDON'S
THEN THREE SPECKS OF GLARING BLUE LIGHT SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE SKY JERKING HIS EYES UP
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT WHEN I SPOTTED THE APEMAN CARRYING A GUY WITH A BAD SHOULDER AWAY FROM HERE
THANKS IZZY THANKS YOURSELF THE KID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
HERE AND THERE HOUSES HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO DURING THE NIGHT
AFTER A WHILE THE BOTTLE WAS GONE
A DAMNED GOOD THING SECURITY'S SENDING A SHIP
HE WENT BY IZZY'S ROOM WITHOUT STOPPING
GORDON TURNED INTO HIS USUAL SHORT-CUT PAST A RAMBLING PLASTICS PLANT AND THROUGH THE YARD WHERE THEIR TRUCKS WERE PARKED
YOU'RE OVERLOOKING SOMETHING HENDRIX GORDON CUT IN
HE FOUND HIS SUIT AND HELMET AND CLAMPED THEM ON QUICKLY TRANSFERRING THE KNIFE TO ITS SPRING SHEATH OUTSIDE THE SUIT
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT SHE BENT OVER TO PICK UP THE BANDAGES AND TO FINISH WITH HIS HEAD
MOTHER COREY CHUCKLED
WHY NOT GORDON
I'VE GOT THIS NAILED SHUT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF AN EFFORT OF SOME KIND GOING ON AS SHE TALKED
WHY'D YOU COME BACK HE ASKED SUDDENLY
HE MAY HAVE A CONCUSSION
BETTER CHECK THE NAME OFF UNLESS THE REAL MURTAGH SHOWS UP
GORDON SHUDDERED FAINTLY THEN FOLLOWED IZZY AND THE MOTHER INTO THE SEMI-SECRET ENTRANCE
GORDON STOPPED REALIZING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE WAS NO TRACE OF EFFORTS TO PROTECT IT AGAINST THE COMING NIGHT AND DAY
SOMETIME DURING THE DISCUSSION SHE MADE COFFEE AND FIRST RANDOLPH THEN THE KID CAME IN FOR BRIEFING
WHERE'S THE NEAREST IZZY FROWNED BUT SUPPLIED THE INFORMATION
I--BRUCE I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME SO I GUESS IT ISN'T TOO HARD FOR YOU
BRUCE SHEILA STOOD OUTLINED IN THE DOORWAY AGAINST THE DIM GLOW OF A PHOSPHOR BULB
SUCH SMALL RAIDS WERE NOMINALLY ON THE EXCUSE OF EXTENDING THE BOUNDARIES BUT ACTUALLY THEY WERE OUT-AND-OUT LOOTING
GORDON SNAPPED HIS HEAD UP TO SEE IZZY STANDING THERE
MOTHER COREY'S IMMENSE ARM MOVED OUT CASUALLY SWEEPING HER BACK ONTO THE COUCH
THEN HER EYES FELL ON GORDON
HER HAND SCOOPED UP THE KNIFE AND SHE CAME CHARGING TOWARD HIM HER MOUTH A TAUT SLIT ACROSS HALF-BARED TEETH
BUT GORDON WASN'T TOO SURPRISED WHEN HIS RELIEF SHOWED UP TWO HOURS LATE
TAKE IT FROM ME BROTHER THAT'S SOMETHING
HOW COME A MUCKRAKING NEWSPAPERMAN LIKE YOU NEVER TURNED UP ANYTHING ON THEM GORDON GORDON SHRUGGED
AN EGG-SIZED ROCK HIT THE TRUCK BEHIND HIM AND BOUNCED BACK JUST AS HE SPOTTED A HOODLUM DRAWING BACK A SLING FOR A SECOND SHOT
YOU REALLY WOULD
FINGERS TOUCHED HIS HEAD CAREFULLY BRUSHING THE HAIR BACK DELICATELY FROM THE SIDE OF HIS SKULL
STEPS SOUNDED FROM OUTSIDE
GORDON TURNED BACK
YOUR WIFE TOOK A HELLUVA CHANCE GORDON TRENCH SAID HEAVILY
MURDOCH HELD UP ONE FINGER AND PUT HIMSELF INTO A POSITION TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT
WHERE IS IT SHEILA
THERE WERE ABOUT THIRTY COPS INSIDE GATHERED AROUND MAYOR WAYNE WITH TRENCH STANDING AT ONE SIDE
HE STARED AT THE ROUT AND SUDDENLY STOPPED FIGHTING THE HANDS HOLDING HIM
THAT'S WHY WE RATE YOU HIGHER THAN YOU THINK YOU ARE
THE OWNERS OF THE JOINTS DIDN'T CARE WHETHER THEY PAID THE SECOND DAILY DOLE TO THE SAME MAN OR ANOTHER BUT THEY WOULDN'T PAY IT AGAIN THAT SAME NIGHT
GET YOUR COPS TO GIVE US AN ESCORT FOR EVERY SHIPMENT THROUGH TO THE DOME AND WE'LL DROP OFF ONE CAR OUT OF FOUR FOR THE OUTLANDS GORDON SAT BACK WEAKLY
A WARM-BLOODED AFFECTIONATE HUSBAND TO BOOT HE BENT DOWN KNOCKING ASIDE HER FLAILING ARMS AND PULLED HER CLOSER TO HIM
HE DUCKED DOWN BACK ALLEYS UNTIL HE REACHED THE RIGHT SECTION
OR SHOULD I TAKE IT BACK HE TURNED IT OVER IN HIS HANDS SLOWLY AND THE SMILE CAME BACK TO HIS FACE GRADUALLY
THE BEAT WAS IN A SHABBY SECTION WHERE CLERKS AND SKILLED LABORERS WORKED
GET TO YOUR BEAT GORDON GRINNED WRYLY AT THE EMPHASIS ON HIS TITLE
RANDOLPH WAS A NATURAL ADDITION AND THE KID HAD BEEN ALTERNATELY FOLLOWING GORDON AND SHEILA AROUND SINCE HE'D FIRST HEARD THEY WERE FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEN WHO'D ROBBED HIM OF HIS RIGHT TO SPEAK
IT HADN'T BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME TO BE CONTAMINATED BY MOTHER COREY SO THE SMELL COULD ONLY COME FROM ONE PLACE
ALL WEEK WE WORK ALL HOURS
THEY BEEN PAYING ME OFF--AND THAT'S A RETAINER YOU MIGHT SAY
THAT PAPER YOU SWIPED WAS MARKED TOP SECRET
HE WATCHED A GROUP BREAK INTO A SMALL GROCERY STORE TO COME OUT WITH BUNDLES
THE CROOK GRUNTED AS HE STARTED TO TURN AND STUMBLED ONTO GORDON
I KNOW SOME OF THE GEES TRYING TO VOTE
THEN COME BACK AND GIVE ME SIX COLUMNS ON IT
THE MEN WERE WEARING GUNS
THE HOODLUMS YELLED AND DUCKED WHILE SHEILA BROKE INTO A RUN AWAY FROM HIM
IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS GONE THAT HE FOUND A SMALL BOTTLE OF FAIRLY GOOD WHISKEY TUCKED INTO HIS POUCH
THE OLD MAN CHUCKLED
THE DAMNED FOOL OPENED UP ON THE BORDER--FIGURED HE'D CIRCULATE TO BOTH SECTIONS IZZY SAID
THAT CAPPED IT HE THOUGHT
HE WAS CHARGED WITH INCITING A RIOT AND A WARRANT HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST
THE OTHERS MADE NO TROUBLE AS IZZY BOUND THEM WITH BALING WIRE
COMING HERE MYSELF HE EXPLAINED
AGAIN THE GIRL'S FINGER MOTIONED BEHIND HIM
IT WAS A SMALL BLACK MEMO BOOK COVERED WITH PAGES OF SHORTHAND
THERE WAS A LITTLE LIGHT IN THE SKY
ONE OF MY NEW BOYS--ISAACS YOU KNOW HIM--WAS OUT CHECKING UP AFTER YOU AND THE DOPES SEEM TO LIKE YOU GORDON HAD WONDERED WHY IZZY HAD BEEN PULLED OFF THE BEAT
BUT THE GEES WHO PAID ME PROTECTION DIDN'T GET HURT GOV'NOR HE WINCED THEN GRINNED
WITH A CORPSE
CAN'T SAY I THINK MUCH OF YOUR CHOICE OF COMPANIONS THESE DAYS HE COMMENTED LOOKING TOWARD THE BED WHERE O'NEILL WAS COWERING
CHAPTER XVII SECURITY PAYOFF IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE BRUCE GORDON MADE UP HIS MIND TO HUNT UP SECURITY
RANDOLPH WASN'T PREACHING THIS TIME BUT WAS CONTENT TO REPORT THE FACTS HE'D SEEN
WHEN GORDON IDENTIFIED HIMSELF THERE WAS A SNORT OF DISGUST
DAMN IT HE HAD TO DIG UP ENOUGH MONEY TO GET BACK TO EARTH
YOU'RE STAYING HERE CUDDLES
IF A DOCTOR'S JOB WAS TO PREVENT ILLNESS INSTEAD OF MERELY CURING IT THEN WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE A POLICEMAN'S JOB TO PREVENT CRIME
THE EYES HAD CENTERED ON THE ALLEYS ALONG THE STREET AND MEN WERE BEGINNING TO RUN WILDLY WHILE OTHERS WERE JERKING OUT THEIR WEAPONS
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT NOW
STAIRS LAY THERE AND HE TOOK THEM THREE AT A TIME
ALL RIGHT MOTHER HE SAID FINALLY
THEN HE HAD HER FIRMLY BRINGING HER ARM BACK AND UP UNTIL THE KNIFE FELL FROM HER FINGERS
BUT THE WARNING HAD BEEN ENOUGH
THEN A YELL SOUNDED AS MORE LEGALS POURED DOWN THE STREET
HE'D HALF-EXPECTED SOME SUCH NASTINESS FROM TRENCH
GORDON ISAACS--YOU TWO BEEN TALKING BIG ABOUT LAW AND ORDER
HE'D STARTED AT THE COOP WITH A DECK OF CARDS
BESIDE HIM THE KID WAS CRYING MAKING HORRIBLE SOUNDS OF IT
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN FATS YEAH THE OTHER PICKED UP THE DICE AND BEGAN ROLLING SEVENS ABSENTLY
GORDON BENT HIS HEAD SHARPLY AND DROPPED FALLING ONTO HIS SHOULDERS AND SOMERSAULTING OVER
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING A BATH GORDON COMMENTED
HE WAS SUDDENLY IN NO MOOD TO QUIBBLE WITH IZZY'S PERSONAL CODE
TOO BAD SHE HAD TO WEAR A HELMET OR YOU MIGHT HAVE DRAGGED HER HERE BY HER HAIR
MAKE IT TWO BEERS IZZY HE SAID
IT WAS MOTHER COREY
I CAN'T SEE A MAN'S WIFE STARVE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING RUSTY AND ONE OF MOTHER COREY'S MEN WERE ON GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD TURNED IN
I'D RATHER GO TO WAYNE IT SAID BUT I NEED MONEY
IT NOW HAD A CRUDE SIGN PROCLAIMING IT VOLUNTARY POLICE HQ AND OUTLAND GOVERNMENT CENTER
ONE CREDIT A WEEK AND YOU GET MOTHER COREY'S WORD NOBODY BUSTS IN
HE'D HALF-EXPECTED ANOTHER ENCOUNTER WITH THE MOTHER'S GRANDDAUGHTER
OKAY GOV'NOR GORDON HAULED BACK HIS HAND TO KNOCK THE OTHER FROM HIS FEET AND THEN DROPPED IT
WEARING THEIR UNIFORM MAKES ME A TEMPORARY CITIZEN
APPARENTLY HIS REPUTATION HAD GONE AHEAD OF HIM SINCE MOST OF THE HOODLUMS HAD DECIDED PICKINGS WOULD BE EASIER ON SOME BEAT WHERE THE COPS HAD THEIR OWN SECRET RACKETS TO ATTEND TO INSTEAD OF HEAD BUSTING
THE GANG NO THE COPS THEY'RE GIVING ME
HE JERKED THE PIKE AWAY KICKED THE MAN IN THE NECK AS HE FELL AND UNSHEATHED HIS KNIFE WITH THE OTHER HAND
THE OLD WRECK HAD DEMANDED FIVE PER CENT OF HIS WINNINGS FOR TIPPING HIM OFF
THEN JURGENS MEN BROKE IN AND I THOUGHT THEY'D GET IT SO--SO I BURNED IT
IZZY FOLLOWED HIS EYES AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
HELLO BRUCE SHEILA SAID SOFTLY
HE MARCHED HIS MEN UP WITH THE THIN WAILING OF A BANSHEE IN HIS EARS
MURDOCH REMAINED OUTSIDE AND ONE OF THE THUGS REACHED FOR HIM
WITH YOU OUT HERE AND ME BUSY NIGHTS DOING A BIT OF CONVOY WORK ON THE SIDE WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT BOTH LIVE AT MOTHER'S BRUCE GORDON NODDED GRINNING IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
ANY OBJECTIONS YEOMAN THE NOLAN MAN HAD NO OBJECTIONS--OUTWARDLY
THE PROCEDURE WAS THE SAME AT THE NEXT BOOTH THOUGH THEY HAD MORE TROUBLE
A KNOCK SOUNDED FROM ACROSS THE HALL
HE WAS LUCKY
MAYBE I DIDN'T DO YOU A FAVOR GOV'NOR PULLING YOU HERE
YOU AIN'T GONNA BEAT ME THIS TIME
HERE AND THERE A FEW CITIZENS WERE RUSHING ABOUT TRYING TO RESTORE THEM KEEPING WARY EYES ON THE MOBSTERS WHO HAD PASSED OUT ON THE STREETS
THERE WERE NO CABS OUTSIDE TONIGHT OF COURSE
IT'S TIME I FOUND OUT HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE
HE STARED AT THE DOOR FOOLISHLY SWEARING AT ALL WOMEN
SINCE SHE KILLED HIM SHE'S BEEN DOING PRETTY WELL ON HER OWN
HE HOLED UP ONE DAY UNTIL IT REALLY HIT HIM THAT HE COULDN'T GET ANY MORE
YOU'LL BE BLOWN UP GOV'NOR--AND IF YOU AIN'T THEY'LL RIP YOU TO RIBBONS FOR KNOCKING OFF THE DOME THEN HE STOPPED SUDDENLY STARING
MEN WHO WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN PUNCTILIOUS ABOUT THEIR PAYMENTS WERE AVOIDING BRUCE GORDON IF IN HOPE THAT BY PUTTING IT OFF A DAY OR SO THEY COULD RUN INTO A PERIOD WHERE NO SUCH PAYMENT WOULD EVER BE ASKED--OR A SMALLER ONE AT LEAST
THIRD-GENERATION CHILDREN--NOT ALL BUT A LOT OF THEM--ARE BREATHING THE AIR WE'D DIE ON AND THEY'RE DOING FINE AT IT
YOUR FRIEND HAS NO RECORD WITH US HE SAID IN A ROUTINE VOICE
SURE IZZY PATTED THE LITTLE PACKAGE
FORGET THE CROOKS AND CROOKED COPS MAN
THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG WERE ALMOST GONE BUT IT TOOK A STRAINING OF EVERY NERVE TO REACH HIS UNIFORM POUCH
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW BRUCE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STARTED BACK DOWN THE STAIRS
NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER MURDOCH GRINNED BITTERLY
BUT INSIDE THERE WERE GUARDS PACING ALONG IT
YEAH IZZY LOOKED WORRIED HIS THIN FACE PINCHED IN
MAYBE THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT
NO HARD FEELINGS GOV'NOR NOW
THE KID GRINNED RUBBING HIS BRUISE
AND IT WOULDN'T BE RANDOLPH'S CHARITY
HE COULD ONLY HOPE SHE WOULD LOOK
LET THEM GO KID
I'LL TAKE THE DRAG CAR HE FOUND RANDOLPH WAITING IN A SCOOTER OUTSIDE THE PRECINCT HOUSE AFTER HE'D REPORTED HIS RESULTS
WE EVEN GOTTA WEAR CIVVIES WHEN WE GO OUT TO VOTE FOR WAYNE GORDON LOOKED DOWN AT THE RIOTERS WHO WERE NOW ONLY KEEPING UP A PRETENSE OF A PARADE
THERE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MEN SOME OF THEM ARMED
A PLACE OF SAFETY HAD TO COME FIRST
HERE GOV'NOR HE PICKED UP A COPY OF RANDOLPH'S NEW LITTLE TRUTH AND POINTED TO THE HEADLINE
SIGNS OF SCURVY AND PELLAGRA WERE INCREASING
HE NODDED
COME ON HE SAID FINALLY
GORDON EXPLAINED THE SITUATION HASTILY
THEN HIS FOOT KICKED OUT KNOCKING HER FEET OUT FROM UNDER HER
HE NODDED AND HER BREATH CAUGHT
HE'S A RIGHT GEE MOTHER COREY CHUCKLED
MURDOCH MUST HAVE PREPARED IT HIDDEN IT IN THE NOTEBOOK THEN DIED BEFORE THE SECRET COULD BE REVEALED
SHEILA WATCHED HIM UNCERTAINLY AND THEN TOOK POSSESSION OF THE NEXT ROOM
THE MAN SEEMED TO AVOID FACING HIM MUTTERED CAPTAIN SAYS REPORT IN PERSON AT ONCE AND SWUNG OUT OF THE SCOOTER AND ONTO HIS BEAT WITHOUT FURTHER WORDS
HE CLIPPED THE CROOK ON THE INSIDE OF THE ELBOW WHILE GRABBING THE WRIST WITH HIS OTHER HAND
FOOD AND SOME OTHER STUFF
BUT THE TIME HE TOOK A SPECIAL RELEASE OUT TO THE SPACEPORT WAS THE WORST
FATS WOULD PROBABLY MAKE MORE THAN EVER
HE CAME HOME THE THIRD EVENING TO FIND THAT SHEILA HAD MANAGED TO FIND SPACE FOR HER BUNK IN HIS ROOM CUT OFF BY A HEAVY SCREEN AND HAD CLOSED THE OTHER ROOM TO SAVE THE RENT
HE JERKED FORWARD AND CAUGHT THE DRIVER'S SHOULDER
HE GOT HIS FEET UNDER HIM SLOWLY BUT HE WAS REVIVING ENOUGH TO STAND THE PAIN IN HIS HEAD
NONE OF US ARE
EVERY BOOK ON MARS GAVE THE FACT THAT THE CANALS WERE EITHER AN ILLUSION OR SOMETHING WHICH COULD NOT BE DETECTED ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES TO GET OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE WE COME OUT WITH RIFLES AND KNOCK YOU OFF
WE GET A QUARTER VALUE
WAYNE GOT THE HONOR SYSTEM FIXED FOR US
GORDON MANAGED TO GET ONTO A PILE OF RUBBLE WHERE HE COULD SEE OVER THE CROWD
TRENCH DROVE
PLEASE THE VOICE REACHED BACK THINLY AS THE BANK PRESIDENT GOT HIS SILENCE
AND I HEAR THE GANGS ARE JUST ABOUT IN CONTROL OF BOTH SECTIONS LATELY THE CHICKEN COOP WAS FILLED AS RANDOLPH HAD SAID BUT HE SLIPPED IN AND UP THE STAIRS LEAVING THE NEWS TO THE PUBLISHER
HIS HAND SNAKED OUT CAUGHT THE STRAP FROM GORDON'S HAND AND JERKED IT FREE
AND AT THE FIRST SIGN MOTHER COREY LEAPED FORWARD DROPPING HIS FLAIL AND GATHERING IZZY AND GORDON UNDER HIS ARMS
THE USUAL MAN IS SICK AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN TRUST WITH THE JOB GORDON STUCK IT OUT SOMEHOW BUT IT WASN'T WORTH IT
GORDON NODDED TO A COUPLE AND THEY GRINNED FAINTLY AT HIM
HE CLIMBED IN WOODENLY LEAVING HIS HELMET ON AS HE SAW THE BROKEN WINDOW
TO YOU IT'S A HEAVY HAND FELL ON THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND MOTHER COREY LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY
REBELLION REBELLION
HE HEARD THE SOUND OF A MOBILE AMPLIFIER AND STRAINED HIS EARS TOWARD IT
HIS HAND DARTED DOWN TO HIS BELT JUST AS GORDON REACHED HIM
THERE WERE THE BOOKS OF REGISTRATION WITH A CHECKER FOR WAYNE ONE FOR NOLAN AND A THIRD SUPPOSEDLY NEUTRAL BEHIND THE PLANK THAT SERVED AS A DESK
AHEAD TRUCKS FORMED A SORT OF V FORMATION AS THEY REACHED THE GROUNDS AROUND IT AND BEGAN BULLING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE GROUPS THAT WERE TRYING TO ORGANIZE A DEFENSE
BUT ONCE THEY HIT THE MAIN STEM THINGS WERE MERE ROUTINE
GORDON WENT OUT TO GET THE OTHERS AND START MOVING IN THE SUPPLIES AND TRANSFERRING THE CORPSES TO THE TRUCK FOR DISPOSAL
THE FIGURE ON HIS BACK SAILED OVER HIS HEAD TO LAND WITH A HARSH THUMP ON THE GROUND
THEY STAY ON EARTH BEING CAREFUL NOT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE UP HERE HE TOLD HER BITTERLY
HE FOUND HIMSELF LIKING THE OTHER
IT WON'T WORK
BETTER MAKE OUT A FORM NEXT WEEK AND START PAYING IT REGULARLY
SO THEY PAY DOUBLE TOMORROW
THERE'D BE A DELAY BEFORE ANY ORGANIZED SEARCH COULD BE MADE FOR THE FUGITIVES
THE CABLE OFFICES MUST BE OPEN FOR THE DOCTORED REPORTS ON THE ELECTION TO EARTH
GORDON DUCKED AS A KNIFE SAILED FOR HIS HEAD
MY BOYS ALWAYS WANTED TO BE COPS YOU KNOW GORDON TRIED TO GRIN IN RETURN AS HE MOVED CLOSER SLIPPING THE HEAVY LOCUST CLUB OFF HIS WRIST
UMM HE SWALLOWED SLOWLY AS IF TASTING THE FOOD ALL THE WAY DOWN
LEGAL FORCES ALREADY CONTROLLED ABOUT HALF THE CITY
AND YET DRIVEN TO WORK TOGETHER OR TO PERISH TOGETHER
YOU STAYING OVER OR WANT ME TO GIVE YOU AN ENGINEER AND DRAG CAR SO YOU CAN RIDE BACK IN COMFORT GORDON STARED AT THE ROOM WHERE ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS A PRODUCT OF THE PLANET AT PRAEGER AND AT THE GIRL
THE PRINCESS
HER HEAD HIT HIS ARM AND SHE SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP ALMOST AT ONCE
WRECKS WERE BEING BROKEN UP WITH SALVAGEABLE MATERIAL USED FOR NEWER HOMES
AND I PACKED YOUR THINGS TOO HE SHOT HIS EYES AROUND THE ROOM REALIZING THAT IT WAS PRACTICALLY BARE EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF HER DRESSES
O'NEILL HAD TURNED TO RUN AND THEN SEEMED TO THINK BETTER OF IT
HE CHECKED THE TWO MEN ON THE FLOOR WHO WERE STILL OUT COLD
BRUCE GORDON REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE MISERABLE BUSINESS SECTION NOTICING THAT A COUPLE OF THE SHOPS WERE STILL OPEN
I'LL HAVE TO TRUST YOU GORDON
I JUST DID
HIGH MAN FOR SIXTY HE SAID AUTOMATICALLY AND EXPERTLY ROLLED BULL'S-EYES FOR A TWO
I DECLARE US TO BE IN A STATE OF REVOLUTION
YOU'VE GOT A WIFE HOME MUCKRAKER
IT'S THE ONLY HOPE WE'VE GOT OF NOT HAVING ALL THE PLANETS TURNED INTO COLONIAL EMPIRES
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE THUG BUT FATS CAME OUT OF HIS BACK OFFICE JUST AS GORDON REACHED THE LITTLE BAR
SHE SURE IS THE CREW AT THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN ALERTED AND NOW BEGAN CLEARING IT ASIDE HASTILY WHILE OTHERS KEPT UP A COVERING FIRE AGAINST THE FEW MUNICIPALS
ELECTION ONLY THREE WEEKS AWAY GORDON WENT HOME
PRETTY SOON THEY'LL BE TRICK-PROOF ANYHOW
THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD ESTIMATING WHAT WAS LEFT TO GORDON
XIV FULL CIRCLE XV MURDOCH'S MANTLE XVI GET THE DOME
NOTHING COULD HELP BREAK UP THE GANGS MORE THAN HAVING A LEADER BREAK DOWN IN PUBLIC
GET YOUR SUITS ONE FLOOR DOWN END OF THE HALL
THE GROSS HULK OF MOTHER COREY APPEARED ALMOST AT ONCE
HE HESITATED BUT FINALLY TOOK SOME OF THE FOOD
NO COPS TO INFLUENCE THE VOTE THAT'S THE WORD
YOU'D BETTER CALL THE HOSPITAL HE TOLD HER SHARPLY
SHE FOLLOWED HIS GAZE AND SHOOK HER HEAD
A THIN SCREECH LIKE A WHISTLE CAME FROM MURDOCH'S MARSPEAKER AND THE CAPTAIN WENT FORWARD WITH GORDON AT HIS HEELS
GORDON GOT TO HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND BEGAN CRAWLING AWAY FROM THE CORNER
MOTHER GOT AHOLD OF A LOAD OF SNOW AND SENT ME OUT TO CONTACT A BIG PUSHER
FOR A SECOND THE CITIZENS BROKE
IF YOU WANT THE REST OF THIS YOU'VE GOT UNTIL THREE TONIGHT TO MAKE AN OFFER
THE REACTION FROM HIS EFFORT HAD DRAINED HIM
I MEAN THAT GORDON STARTED OFF DISREGARDING THE WORDS
HE WAS A CLERK ONCE FOR SECURITY
LUCKY WE FOUND A GOOD CAR TO STEAL MOTHER COREY WHEEZED
YOU COME RIGHT OUT OR I'M GONNA BLAST THAT THERE DOOR DOWN
BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE THE QUESTION OF WHERE HE BELONGED OR WHAT HE SHOULD DO ANY EASIER
A MAN WAS ALREADY DEAD AND DANGLING
GORDON SWORE BUT THERE WAS NO SENSE IN TWO OF THEM RISKING THEMSELVES ONLY TO ATTRACT MORE ATTENTION
GORDON'S OTHER LEG SPUN HIM AROUND STILL CROUCHING
HE'D HAD NO GUNS
GORDON ESTIMATED THE CHANCES OF ESCAPE AND THEN LEAPED FORWARD INTO THEIR GROUP WITH IZZY AT HIS SIDE SEEKING CLOSE QUARTERS WHERE GUNS WOULDN'T WORK
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL OUR POLICE FORCE FROM US AND USE IT FOR THEIR WAR
BUT THE HOODLUM WASN'T ALONE
MOTHER COREY NODDED
SHE LET THE ROBE FALL TO THE FLOOR AND SLID INTO THE BED WITHOUT TAKING HER EYES OFF HIM
GORDON WENT OUT TO DO SOME SHOPPING
THEN WHO CARES
HELL WHO WOULDN'T LOOT YOUR TRAINS IF THAT'S GOING ON ALL RIGHT IF MOTHER COREY'LL BACK UP THIS VOLUNTEER POLICE GROUP
IN HIS PLACE AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MUNICIPAL CAPTAIN SAT THE HEAVY FIGURE OF JURGENS
NICK THE CROOP HAD RIDDEN HIS REPUTATION LONG ENOUGH TO BE CARELESS AND THE THIRD TRUCK HAD ITS KEY STILL IN THE LOCK
OR STAY IN THERE AND WE'LL BLAST YOU OUT--IN PIECES IT WAS THE VOICE OF JURGENS HENCHMAN WHO HAD CALLED ON MOTHER COREY BEFORE ELECTIONS
SHE SAT UP AS HE RELEASED HIS KNEE HER HOARSE VOICE SQUEEZED FROM BETWEEN HER WRITHING LIPS
HIS HEAD WAS SWIMMING IN A HOT MAELSTROM OF PAIN BUT IT WAS QUIETING AS HIS BREATHING RETURNED TO NORMAL
I AIN'T SO BAD OFF
BANKS WILL BE REOPENED AS RAPIDLY AS THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT CAN EXTEND ITS CONTROL AND ALL DEPOSITS PREVIOUSLY MADE WILL BE HONORED IN FULL THAT BROUGHT A CHEER FROM THE CROWD AS THE SOUND TRUCK MOVED ON
IT HAS TO BE THE ANSWER
IF THE CRACKLE COMES FROM THE PEOPLE AND THESE GEES GIVE EVERYBODY A SKULL CRACKING THEN THEY'RE CROOKS
HIS COLLECTIONS HAD BEEN FALLING OFF ALREADY AND HE KNEW THAT HE'D BE ON THE CARPET FOR THAT IF HE DIDN'T DO BETTER
SHE'D ASKED NO QUESTIONS AND HADN'T EVEN TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT HE'D BE SENT BACK TO EARTH NOW
ARREST A VOICE FROM THE DOOR SAID HARSHLY AND BRUCE GORDON SWUNG TO SEE SIX LEGALS FILING IN HEADED BY HENDRIX HIMSELF
HE POINTED OUTSIDE
GORDON SAW ANOTHER TRUCK GO BY AND FELT A BULLET MISS HIM BY INCHES
SHE PICKED UP A WAYNE BALLOT AND DROPPED IT IN THE BOX
AND TIP THEM OFF TO WHERE IT IS PROBABLY
FINALLY HE GOT DOWN TO HIS ERRAND
OKAY LUCK SERGEANT IT MADE NO SENSE TO GORDON BUT HE WASN'T GOING TO ARGUE
HE SPOTTED THE SQUAD CAR FAR BEHIND DUCKED THROUGH A MAZE OF ALLEYS AND LOST IT FOR ANOTHER FEW PRECIOUS MINUTES
GORDON SHOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED BUT HE FELT LIKE JUDAS PICKING UP THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER
STREAMS OF LIQUID JETTED OUT AND THEIR AGONIZED CRIES FOLLOWED
WHEREVER THE BOOTHS WERE BEING THROWN UP THE NEARBY ESTABLISHMENTS WERE RUSHING GATES AND BARRICADES IN FRONT OF THE BUILDINGS
BUT I HEARD HIM RAVING TOO
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO STICK TO SELLING MEALS MOSTLY--FOR A WHILE AT LEAST
THE HOOD SAILED UP AND STRUCK THE TWO KNIFE-MEN SQUARELY
ANYHOW YOU WON'T MISS IT
HE CAME TO A DARK ALLEY SMELLING OF DECAY WHERE GARBAGE HAD PILED UP WITHOUT BEING CARTED AWAY
THEN HE CAME TO VILLAGES
BUT SOMEHOW HE COULDN'T LEAVE HIS BODY WITH THE OLD COUPLE
HE DROPPED THEM FINALLY AS THEY CAME TO A SIDE ENTRANCE
CUDDLES YOU BROKE THE CHAIN ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK AGAIN
WORSE THAN EVEN THAT GRANDDAUGHTER OF MINE
MEN STOOD OUTSIDE STUDYING THE COPS ON THEIR BEAT
IZZY CUT HIM OFF
THEY'RE POISONING THE AIR BUT THE TRICK WORKED
THE TWO MEN IN THE ROOM WERE BOTH HOLDING KNIVES BUT IN THE RIDICULOUS OVERHAND POSITION THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INGRAINED STUPIDITY OF THE HUMAN RACE UNTIL IT'S TAUGHT BETTER
THE CROUPIER WAS A LITTLE WIZENED MAN WANTED ON EARTH
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM BRUCE GORDON GRIMACED
HE STARTED TO TURN BUT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD QUICKLY
IT CAME OUT JUST AS THEY REALIZED HE'D TRICKED THEM
BUT IT WAS IN THE PRINTING-PRESS SCRIP OF LEGAL CURRENCY USEFUL ONLY THROUGH MAYOR GANNETT'S TRICK EXCHANGES
BUT I'M GOING TO RUN A STRAIGHT BEAT OR ELSE THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A CALL TO REMOVE A BERSERK SPACEMAN FROM ONE OF THE SO-CALLED ROOMING HOUSES
THE REAL SECURITY WAS ARRIVING
I BURNED IT
HE HEADED FOR THE NEAREST ALLEY WHICH LED THROUGH THE TRUCKYARD OF NICK THE CROOP
YOU'LL NEED IT
NOTORIOUS--WORST PLACE ON MARS
AND I HOPE NOBODY FINDS THEM HE COMMENTED
YOU SEEM TO HAVE FRIENDS HERE HE COMMENTED
THE GUARD HALTED THEM BUT WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION
TWO WATER CLOSETS
HE WAS SURPRISED AS SHE FUMBLED IT ON TO SEE THAT IT FITTED--AND MORE SURPRISED AT THE SUDDEN REALIZATION THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO IT
HE WATCHED HER GO SICK INSIDE AND THE LAST HE SAW WAS THE HAND SHE HELD UP WAVING THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK AT HIM
CARTILAGE CRUNCHED AND A SHRILL CRY OF AGONY LANCED OUT
HIS THIN HIGH VOICE WAS COOL AND RESERVED IN KEEPING WITH THE OPINION HE HAD EXPRESSED PUBLICLY OF THE POLICE AS A BODY
COREY STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE HALL AS GORDON ENTERED AND STARTED TO RETIRE AGAIN--UNTIL HE SPOTTED MURDOCH
HELLO BRUCE
AND SUPPOSE NOTHING HAPPENS HE ASKED
THANKS MOTHER BUT I'LL BE STAYING INSIDE THE DOME I GUESS SO'LL I THE OLD MAN GLOATED
HE WENT OUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR IZZY TO FOLLOW
AND YOU CORPORAL GORDON
I'VE STILL GOT CONNECTIONS BACK THERE OKAY GORDON SAID BITTERLY
RIFLES IZZY COMMENTED IN DISGUST
NOW A CAR WITH A LOUDSPEAKER ON TOP ROLLED INTO VIEW--A COMPLETELY ARMORED CAR
WELL COME ON PETE
GO OUT AND GET DRUNK OR SOMETHING THE COMPARATIVE FRIENDLINESS OF THE PEACE OFFERING WAS PROBABLY THE ULTIMATE IN GRACIOUSNESS FROM TRENCH
IT MET A SMALL ROUND SHIELD ON THE ARM OF THE MAN HE HAD CHOSEN AND WAS DEFLECTED AT ONCE
THERE WERE TWO PILES AND THIS PILE WAS ALREADY FILLED OUT FOR WAYNE
ALL FOOD SHOULD BE TURNED IN HE EXPLAINED TO GORDON AS THEY CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TRUCK
GORDON CAUGHT IT UP AND SWUNG IN A SINGLE MOTION THAT STRETCHED THE OTHER OUT
SURE BABY
THE GIANT PUSHED IN AFTER THE SMALLER THUG
EVER GET THAT LOUSE YOU WERE OUT FOR SHE NODDED
IF WE HOLD PAST MIDNIGHT WE'LL BE SET GOV'NOR HE SAID
I'M NEW--AND I'M STRAPPED NOW
A FEW STARED AT GORDON AND HIS BURDEN BUT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN LOOK UP
AND I'M GETTING OLD AND SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE CHICKEN COOP HE CHUCKLED RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER
I NEVER MEANT TO GO BACK
OUT OF HABIT HE PUT ON HIS UNIFORM AND WENT ACROSS TO IZZY'S ROOM
PART OF JURGENS OLD CROWD HAD BROKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND ESTABLISHED A CORNER ON MOST OF THE DRUGS AVAILABLE
EITHER OF YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY STENCILS AND INK AND FIND SOME KIND OF A TRUCK TO HAUL THIS PAPER ALONG IZZY STOPPED AND STARED AT THE RABBITY PALE LITTLE MAN
WE GOTTA SEE ABOUT GETTING OUT A GOOD VOTE
GOTT IN HIMMEL LOOK AT ME
PRAEGER NODDED
NOW ANOTHER GROUP CAME ONTO THE SCENE AND THE PLANTERS MEN BEGAN GETTING OUT RAPIDLY
THEY EXPECTED THE CITIZENS TO YELL UNCLE ALL THE WAY BACK TO EARTH
A FRESH CRY FROM THE STREET CUT INTO HIS ORDER HOWEVER
TRAITOR
GAVE THEM SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR HERE COBBER
GET THE OLD MAN BRUCE GORDON HAD NO TIME TO LOOK BACK
AT HIS QUESTIONS GORDON TOLD THE STORY TERSELY
THE DAMNED STUPID BLUNDERING FOOLS
THEY PLAN MAYBE ON GETTING RICH AND GOING BACK TO EARTH NOBODY GOES BACK MOTHER COREY WHEEZED
THE CAPTAIN TOOK IT AND NODDED
AND WHEN YOUR LUCK'S MADE OR BROKEN REMEMBER MOTHER COREY WAS YOUR FRIEND FIRST AND YOUR OLD MOTHER CAN GET LONGER USE FROM THEM THAN YOU CAN HE WADDLED OFF TELLING OF HIS PLANS TO TAKE MARS FOR A CLEANING ONCE LONG AGO
TWO MORE GROUPS WERE GIVEN THE TREATMENT
IN THE BEAM OF GORDON'S TORCH A SINGLE FIGURE LAY SPRAWLED OUT ON THE FLOOR HALFWAY TO THE RICKETY STAIRS TO THE MAIN HOUSE
ALL HE WANTS IS THIS PLACE--WE GOT USE FOR IT
DURING THAT TIME BY PLAYING IT CAREFULLY HE SHOULD HAVE HIS STAKE
IF ANY MEMBERS OF THE GANG WERE AROUND THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO RESCUE HIM
CREDITS WON'T BE WORTH MUCH UNTIL THEY GET THIS MESS STRAIGHTENED OUT GORDON FELT THE HAIR AT THE BASE OF HIS NECK TINGLE
I'M GOING TO START IT OFF WITH FIVE THOUSAND CREDITS TWO THOUSAND OF THEM RIGHT NOW THEY FELL IN LINE THOUGH THERE WAS NO CHEERING
WHEN A TURKEY SEES CORN ON THE MENU IT'S TIME TO WONDER ABOUT THANKSGIVING
I PLANNED ON THAT
THEN A BARRICADE LAY AHEAD
IZZY NODDED
SHE PIVOTED ON HER HEEL HIT THE DOOR AND HER HEELS WERE CLATTERING ON THE STAIRS
HOW IN HELL DO I MARRY HER WITHOUT ANY RIGMAROLE IZZY'S FACE SEEMED TO DROP TOWARD THE FLOOR
HE'D DUG UP ENOUGH ABOUT THE MERCURY SCANDALS TO DOUBLE CIRCULATION
GORDON KICKED AGAINST THE SIDE WAITED AND KICKED AGAIN
HE LET OUT A YELL
I GOTTA BE BACK IN HALF AN HOUR THEY PILED INSIDE AND THE LITTLE ELECTRIC CAR TOOK OFF AT ITS TOP SPEED
THE REST WERE PROBABLY OUT FIGHTING THE LEGALS OR WORRYING ABOUT IT
SUPPOSE THE WHOLE GANG JUMPS US AT ONCE MURDOCH SHRUGGED
GORDON WENT DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE END OF THE HALL IN THE DIRECTION MURDOCH HAD INDICATED
I'D GO MYSELF BUT I'M GETTING TOO OLD TO GO CHASING MEN OUT THERE WHAT'S IN IT GORDON ASKED REACHING FOR HIS HELMET
MARSPORT HAD LEARNED TO HATE ALL COPS AND A CHANGE OF UNIFORM HADN'T ALTERED THAT
NEW COP EH
A BIG MARSPEAKER RAN OUT FROM THE GATE AND THE VOICE OF GANNETT CAME OVER IT
I'VE GOT A YELLOW TICKET FROM SECURITY MURDOCH BLINKED
EXCEPT FOR THE LIGHTS AND WATER OF COURSE IZZY NODDED AND GORDON SHRUGGED
CHAPTER XV MURDOCH'S MANTLE THERE WERE THREE MEN EACH WITH A WHITE CIRCLE PAINTED ON CHEST AND LEFT ARM TALKING TO MOTHER COREY WHEN BRUCE GORDON CAME DOWN THE RICKETY STEPS
BUT WE CAN'T COUNT ON ANY MORE TIME YOU'RE GOING THROUGH WITH IT RANDOLPH ASKED DOUBTFULLY
COME OFF THE HEAD-COP ROLE
SHOULDN'T OUGHTA
MOTHER COREY WAS STARING ABOUT WHEN THEY RETURNED
HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAW THE BILLS IN FRONT OF HIM AT WHICH THE WOMAN WAS STARING UNBELIEVINGLY
COME ON BUT ALREADY THE MEN WERE EVAPORATING
GOOD HERE'S YOUR RECEIPT
THERE WAS NO ANSWERING FIRE
ARE YOU HUNGRY
THEN GABLE COMES
GORDON POCKETED THE REVOLVER WITH HIS FREE HAND
HIS EYES DARTED DOWN TO WHERE THE FULL WEIGHT OF GORDON SEEMED TO REST ON THE HEEL THAT WAS GRINDING INTO HIS INSTEP
A MUCH BETTER CHANCE THE HINT WAS HARDLY VEILED
WHO'S THIS THE PHONE ASKED
MY WIFE HAD A BABY AND AN OPERATION AND OKAY FELL THE CAPTAIN SAID WITHOUT A SIGN OF DISAPPROVAL
THIS MIGHT BE NEUTRAL TERRITORY BUT THERE WAS NO USE PRESSING IT
HE FOUND THE REST OF THE GROUP READY WITH MOTHER COREY WISHING THEM BETTER LUCK TONIGHT
A PIGPEN
I'M GOING STRAIGHT
FEET POUNDED OUT OF THE DOOR ABOVE AS FATS AND THE BOUNCER BROKE THROUGH
THEN GORDON FELT SOMETHING ON HIS SUIT AND HIS EYES DARTED TO HANDS JUST FINISHING AN EMERGENCY PATCH
I'LL CUT YOU IN
BY JINGO THEY CAN'T SAY WE AIN'T LEGAL NOW
PROBABLY WHAT HAPPENED TO A LOT--MEN LIKE TRENCH SUPPOSED TO BUILD AN ORGANIZATION JUST LEAVING THE LOOSE ENDS HANGING HE GROANED
GORDON SAW GRUDGING ADMIRATION IN THEIR EYES FOR MURDOCH WHO HAD TAKEN MORE PUNISHMENT THAN THEY HAD
ANYHOW YOU'RE AS ENTITLED TO IT AS HE WAS--OR THE GRAFTERS BACK AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
EH YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ME COBBER GORDON HADN'T
IT CUT THROUGH THE AIR A SCANT EIGHT FEET JERKED TO A STOP AGAINST JURGENS FOREHEAD AND CLATTERED ONTO THE TOP OF THE DESK WHILE JURGENS FOLDED OVER HIS MOUTH STILL OPEN HIS HAND SLUMPING OUT OF THE DRAWER
THEY SELDOM SAW A MAN AFTER HE'D BEEN TREATED
GORDON TOOK A STEP BACKWARDS PREPARING TO DUCK
SAME ONES--SAME IDENTICAL ONES I WORE OUT NIGH TWENTY YEARS AGO
BUT HE DID NOT PROTEST COREY'S SELECTION OF A PARTNER
THAT PUTS ME OUT OF EARTH'S JURISDICTION
THEN GORDON'S LIPS TWISTED AS HE REALIZED IT WASN'T ALL GRAVY
YOU'RE RIGHT
JUST REMEMBER IT WAS YOUR IDEA HE'D HAD A LOT OF IDEAS IT SEEMED
HELLO O'NEILL HE SAID
NOW WHERE'S THIS GORDON FELLOW HERE GORDON TOLD THE MAN
A HUBBUB SOUNDED OUTSIDE AND TRENCH GRIMACED AS A POLICE WHISTLE SOUNDED AND A MUNICIPAL COP RAN BY
A SLEEPY VOICE ANSWERED TO SAY THAT COMMISSIONER ARLISS AND MAYOR WAYNE WERE SLEEPING
SO WE'RE BEING SMOTHERED BACK INTO THE FORCE AND THEY'LL HAVE THEIR PATSIES OUT HERE SETTING THINGS UP FOR THE STONEWALL BOYS TO COME BACK BY ELECTION TIME
HE LISTENED TO THE DRIVER EXPLAINING TO A COUPLE OF FIRSTERS THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ON WHAT APPEARED TO BE ONE OF THE MYSTERIOUS CANALS WHEN VIEWED FROM EARTH
YOU DON'T HATE ME ANY MORE SHE RUBBED HER WRIST ACROSS HER EYES AND THE GHOST OF A SMILE TOUCHED HER LIPS
THE IDIOT TRENCH GRABBED GORDON AND SPUN OUT RUNNING TOWARD THE ADVANCING MEN
NO EXPLOSION CAME
THE THREE CAME BACK SHEILA IN THE LEAD WITH HER KNIFE FLASHING
I'VE GOT THE BASIC PLANS IN THE BOOK HERE HE SLUMPED BACK
GORDON WAS ON HIS KNEES BETWEEN HEARTBEATS DARTING UNDER ONE OF THE TRUCKS
IZZY AND BRUCE
HIS VOICE WAS CRACKED IN HIS EARS
IF IT WAS A BIG IF AND A VAGUE ONE
TOO BAD HE SIGHED PONDEROUSLY
THERE WERE A FEW WISPS OF LONG GRAY HAIR ON THE HEAD AND FACE AND THEY QUIVERED AS HE MOVED FORWARD
MAYBE HER IDEA OF MARRIED LIFE WAS DIFFERENT FROM HIS
AND WHEN THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED YOUR ACCOUNTS GO IN AND COLLECT THE MONEY
THE PAPER BACKING PEELED AWAY EASILY
GORDON FROWNED THEN FOUND THE BOOK AND PULLED IT OUT AS GENTLY AS HE COULD
THE OLD MAN NODDED
HE COULD JUST MAKE HIS WAY WITHOUT MARKING HIMSELF WITH A LIGHT
AND WE CAN'T TAKE LESS SO I GUESS WE GOTTA WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY THE NEXT DAY BRUCE GORDON MADE HIS FIRST ARREST
A GOOD THING I WAS TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH YOU
PLACE YOUR BETS TWO OTHERS AROUND THE TABLE WATCHED NARROWLY AS GORDON LEFT HIS CHIPS WHERE THEY WERE
YOUR RETAINER RAN OUT SURPRISINGLY SHE DID SHUT UP
HE LOCATED A PAIR OF PATROLLING COPS AND FOLLOWED THEM DOWN ONE STREET UNTIL THEY SWUNG OFF
KNOCK THEM OUT AND KICK THEM DOWN MURDOCH YELLED
BUT ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT IT STOPPED ALL RIGHT MOTHER COREY SAID SUDDENLY
HI CUDDLES HE SAID FLATLY
BUY YOU A BEER
HE DROPPED TO HIS OWN SIDE WITH BARELY ENOUGH ROOM TO SLIDE BETWEEN THE BED AND THE WALL AND BEGAN DRAGGING OFF HIS BOOTS AND UNIFORM
GORDON PASSED THE FIRST MARSPORT BANK AND SAW THAT IT WAS SURROUNDED BY BARBED WIRES WITH OTHER STRANDS STILL BEING STRUNG AND WITH A SIGN PROCLAIMING THAT THERE WAS HIGH VOLTAGE IN THE WIRES
SPECIAL PRISONERS GORDON TOLD HIM SHARPLY
MURTAGH HE SAID AND HIS VOICE BROKE ON THE SECOND SYLLABLE
ONE THING THOUGH I'VE STILL GOT ENOUGH AUTHORITY TO MAKE YOU A SERGEANT
TRUCKS SHOT OUT OF THE LITTLE ALLEYS JAMMING FORWARD THROUGH THE PEOPLE
SHE CAME BACK A FEW MINUTES LATER STARING AT THE AGES-OLD FILTH
THE LITTLE MAN FOUND A CHAIR AND BOUGHT CHIPS SILENTLY
THEN AS THE SOLIDLY BUILT FIGURE TURNED HE GRUNTED
MY KIDS ARE UP THERE NOW--GRANDKIDS THAT IS
GORDON HAD LEARNED THAT A FAIR NUMBER OF THIRD-GENERATION PEOPLE GOT THAT WAY
I'M STILL RUNNING AN HONEST BEAT AND I BLOODY WELL CAN'T VOTE FOR THAT
HE REMEMBERED THE PROMISE OF FORGIVENESS FOR ALL SINS ON JOINING THE NEW LEGAL FORCE
COREY BROKE INTO A RUN AGAIN DRIVING STRAIGHT INTO THEM AND THROUGH WITH GORDON AND IZZY ON HIS HEELS
LOOK MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE MARTIANS
WHAT ABOUT A LOCK ON THE DOOR GORDON ASKED
A FEW OTHERS HAD TRIED THAT BUT MOST WERE DARTING BACK AS THEY SAW THE COLORS OF NOLAN'S STAR POINT GANG ON THE TRUCKS
GORDON FOUND ONE TABLET OF PAINKILLER LEFT IN THE BOTTLE AND SWALLOWED IT WITH THE DREGS OF THE COFFEE
BUT HE'D READ ENOUGH HISTORY TO KNOW THAT IT WAS FINE--AS LONG AS THE STRUGGLE CONTINUED
HE ATE WHILE THEY EXCHANGED UNCERTAIN RAMBLING INFORMATION
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY EXPLANATION
BUT HE WAS ALREADY PULLING HIS SWING AND IT ONLY GASHED A LONG STREAK
HE MANAGED TO BEND HIS NECK AND ROLL COMING TO HIS FEET
BUT WE DON'T GET MANY MEN WITH YOUR BACKGROUND--COP TINHORN FIGHTER--WHO HAVE BRAINS ENOUGH FOR OUR WORK
IT LISTED THE CRIMES OF WAYNE THEN TORE INTO THE LEGALS AS A BUNCH OF DUPES SENT BY NORTH AMERICA TO FOMENT TROUBLE WHILE THEY LOOTED THE CITY AND TO GIVE THE EARTH GOVERNMENT AN EXCUSE FOR SEIZING MILITARY CONTROL OF MARSPORT OFFICIALLY
AS A FAVOR HE WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE A BEAT WITH HONEST IZZY UNDER CAPTAIN HENDRIX WHO HAD SIMPLY SWITCHED SIDES AFTER LOSING THE MORNING'S BATTLE
A HUNDRED CREDITS A TICKET
SO HE'S HELPING SCHULBERG MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SECTIONS THE VOLUNTEERS DON'T HANDLE
IT WAS RAW BEYOND ANYTHING HE'D EXPECTED--BUT AT LEAST IT SAVED ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE VOTES
HE STOPPED IT WITH HIS WHISTLE AND DUMPED THE PASSENGER OUT UNCEREMONIOUSLY WHILE IZZY GAVE THE ADDRESS
MOSTLY IT WAS ROUTINE WORK
ALL RIGHT HE SAID WHEN THE COFFEE BEGAN WAKING HIM
RANDOLPH SIMPLY QUOTED WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OFFICIAL CABLE FROM SECURITY ON EARTH DENOUNCING BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND DEMANDING THAT BOTH IMMEDIATELY SURRENDER
MOTHER COREY EVIDENTLY HAD PULL ENOUGH TO GET EVERY MOB IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO AFFIX ITS SEAL
NINETY PER CENT OF MARSPORT IS DECENT
PLEASE
SHE MOVED TO A SMALL BAG AND BEGAN DRAWING OUT THE GUN SHE HAD USED AND A KNIFE
COME ON YOU
ENGLAND TRIED IT ON HER COLONIES THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU'VE GOT THE PRINCESS TO WORRY ABOUT
GORDON REACHED FOR IT TWISTING HIS LIPS
THE DOME IS MINED
IZZY'S SMALL FACE PUCKERED UP IN LINES OF WORRY
THE COPS HAD BEEN PASSING THEM ON THE HOPE OF FINDING ONE OF THE LEADERS
WHAT THEY DON'T REALIZE IS THAT THINGS COST TEN TIMES AS MUCH HERE TOO
YOU'RE A TRAITOR AND WE'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN SEEING YOUR GUTS SPILLED THE SECURITY MAN HAD TOLD HIM
BRUCE GORDON WHIPPED HIMSELF INTO FORGETTING SOME OF THAT
HE'S LET ME COME IN BECAUSE HE FIGURES IT WILL GET HIM MORE VOTES
MOTHER COREY GRUNTED AND MOVED QUICKLY TO THE COUGHING BATTERED OLD AIR MACHINE
HE WOULD TRY TO VOTE
GORDON'S HAND WAS ON HIS GUN AS THEY LEAPED FOR SHELTER BUT THERE WAS NO HOSTILE MOVE FROM THE BIG TRUCK
THE OLD MAN WAS SURPRISINGLY ADEPT WITH HIS HANDS AS HE FITTED HINGES AND A CATCH TO THE PANEL AND RE-INSTALLED IT SO THAT SHEILA COULD SWING IT OPEN
I TOLD YOU YOU HAD A PUNCHED MEAL TICKET HE SAID BITTERLY
DON'T ASK ME HOW HIS VOICE WAS A MIXTURE OF BITTERNESS AND AN ODD CERTAINTY
THE SMALL CROWD THAT WAS COLLECTING WAS ALL TO THE GOOD GORDON KNEW AND HE LET O'NEILL GO ON
THANKS HE SAID BUT HIS VOICE WAS BITTER IN HIS EARS
PAPPA SHE SAID SLOWLY
SHE GRABBED AT IT BUT HE SHOVED HER BACK AGAIN
THE TWO CORPORALS WERE AT THE DOOR WHEN GORDON THREW IT OPEN BUT THEY DREW BACK AT THE SIGHT OF HIS DRAWN GUN
AND HE MADE OUT OTHERS BEHIND READY FOR JUST SUCH A MOVE
AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF OVERTIME GORDON REPORTED IN WITH EVERY BONE SORE FROM SMALL MISSILES AND HIS SUIT FILTHY FROM ASSORTED MUCK
YOU TELL HIM THAT
HE TOSSED THE GIRL'S KNIFE DOWN BESIDE HER MOTIONED TO IZZY AND BEGAN HEADING FOR MOTHER COREY'S
FINE WORK GORDON
SECURITY HAD FINALLY GOTTEN AROUND TO HIM IT SEEMED
GOODBYE SHEILA WATCHED HIM GO SHAKING HER HEAD
COME OUT NOW AND WE'LL LET YOU GO PEACEFUL
THE MOBS LEFT THE SECTION ALONE APPARENTLY SCARED OFF BY THE ORGANIZED GROUP READY AND WAITING FOR THEM
GORDON TOOK THE NEXT DAY OFF TO LOOK FOR SHEILA COREY BUT NOBODY WOULD ADMIT HAVING SEEN HER
FIND WHAT CAN BE DONE IF ANYTHING AND DO IT IF YOU CAN
RUSTY AND COREY'S TWO HENCHMEN WERE BUSY LOADING IT WITH AMMUNITION FROM THE CELLAR
HE WATCHED THE LITTLE MAN LEAVE AND REACHED OUT FOR THE MENU
CAN'T HURT NOBODY
THAT'S WHY I NEEDED THE SCRATCH
THE GOVERNMENT SET THEM UP GAVE THEM A MIXTURE OF POWERS AND HAS BEEN TRYING TO KEEP THEM FROM WORKING EVER SINCE
THEN HE SHRUGGED
THEN HE SHRUGGED
THEN HE SHRUGGED
YOU'RE FULLY AUTHORIZED
BUT NOBODY CAME NOBODY CALLED SHE WENT BACK TO TRYING TO BANDAGE THE BLEEDING BLUISH HOLE IN HIS CHEST
THEY HAD FOUGHT THEIR WAY ALMOST TO THE BOOTH BUT THERE A V OF PLANTERS CARS HAD BEEN GOTTEN INTO POSITION SOMEHOW AND GUNFIRE WAS COMING FROM BEHIND THEM
IT IS AN EVIL TIME YOUNG MAN
THEN IT MOVED FORWARD PICKING UP SPEED
HE'D THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN ATTACKING HIM ON THE STREET
THEY'RE BLUFFING
THE KNIFE SLID INTO ITS SHEATH AND THE GUN HOLSTER SNAPPED ONTO THE SUIT
THE KNIFE IN HIS HAND STARTED COMING UP SHARP EDGE LEADING AND AIMED FOR THE BELLY OF THE BRUISER WHO CONFRONTED HIM
GORDON WENT UP THE STAIRS AND THREW HIMSELF ONTO THE BED IN DISGUST
I'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO TEND TO HE MOVED TO ONE CORNER AND BEGAN DRAGGING OUT AN OLD DOUBLE-CYLINDER MIMEOGRAPH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THIS FILTH GORDON GOT UP GRIMACING AT THE OBVIOUS DISMISSAL
IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD
NOW WITH WHAT I GET FROM THE PUSHER I CAN BUY OFF THAT HOT SPOT ON THE POLICE BLOTTER
WAITING FOR HIM WAS THE LEAN CYNICAL LITTLE FIGURE OF HONEST IZZY COMPLETE WITH UNIFORM AND SERGEANT'S STRIPES
THE WHOLE WORKS SHE HAULED THE STUFF IN AND STARTED TO CLOSE THE PANEL
AND IT STICKS COBBER--ONE WAY OR THE OTHER GORDON PAID AND TOSSED HIS POUCH ON THE FILTHY BED
SHE JERKED HER HAND DOWN FOR A KNIFE AND CAME TO HER KNEES HER LIPS DRAWN BACK AGAINST HER TEETH
NO WONDER GABLE COLLECTED YESTERDAY AHEAD OF TIME
OPEN UP WAIT A MINUTE
HERE YOU CARRY HER INSIDE
THE CITY HAD PASSED A NEW POLL TAX--TO PAY FOR ELECTION BOOTHS SUPPOSEDLY--AND HAD MADE THE POLICE COLLECT IT
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE IRON GUTS TO STARVE LIKE A MARTIAN IT ROCKED HIM BACK ON HIS MENTAL HEELS
THE THUG SHRIEKED HOARSELY AND FELL OVER
GORDON YOU HAD TRAINING UNDER MURDOCH--WHO KNEW HIS BUSINESS
BUT HE KEPT HIS SUSPICIONS TO HIMSELF AND GAVE THEM A COVER FROM THE OTHERS
WHY CONGRESS DOESN'T CLEAN IT UP I'LL NEVER KNOW GORDON'S MIND SWITCHED TO THE READERS IN HIS BAG
HE'LL WIN MOTHER COREY REPEATED
IF SECURITY'S SO DAMNED POWERFUL WHY DOESN'T IT STOP THAT HE ASKED BITTERLY
HEARD ABOUT MAYOR WAYNE GORDON SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT CARING BUT THE MAN WENT ON
PRAEGER ARRIVED WITH THE FIRST LOAD OF FOOD AND CAME STORMING UP TO HIM
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT
THEY CLEANED THE PUSHER AND LEFT HIM SITTING ON THE STEPS A PICTURE OF SLUMPED MISERY
THEY WERE STUPID ENOUGH NOT TO AIM FOR HIS STOMACH AT LEAST
THE PARADE WAS ON THE CROOPSTERS IN FULL SWING ALREADY MOSTLY DRUNK
IT'S STILL TRYING TO BE EARTH
ONLY NEXT TIME GORDON PUT THE FACTS ON YOUR RECORD WITH THE FORCE
THEN IT WAS A MELEE
HE MOVED MURDOCH'S BODY ASIDE AND COVERED THE TWO GENTLY
UNDER IT AND ANCHORING IT WAS A CONCRETE WALL ALL AROUND THE CITY
BUT DAWN CAUGHT THEM WITH LESS DONE THAN THEY HAD HOPED
HERE HE TOLD HER
GORDON KNOCKED HIM OUT OF THE WAY WITH HIS ELBOW REACHED FOR THE DOOR TO TRENCH'S PRIVATE OFFICE AND YANKED IT OPEN
IT SEEMED TO WORK
RESENTMENT FLARED BUT THE SCRIP WAS THE ONLY MONEY AVAILABLE AND IT STILL BOUND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW REGIME
BUT MURDOCH WASN'T LIKE THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
GET OUT GORDON BEFORE THEY GANG UP ON US GORDON JERKED HIS EYES BACK TOWARD THE ALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE
HE SQUEALED HE ANNOUNCED
THE SURPRISE ELEMENT WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM A FEW SECONDS
YOU TAKE THAT STORE
MARSPORT HAD BEEN SETTLED FASTER THAN IT WAS READY TO RECEIVE
CHAPTER II HONEST IZZY A LOT COULD BE DONE IN TEN DAYS WHEN A MAN KNEW WHAT HE WAS AFTER
WHAT'S THE ANGLE TRENCH DROPPED THE EYES THAT HAD BEEN BORING INTO HIM
MOTHER COREY MOVED WITHOUT SEEMING HASTE BUT BEFORE THE OTHER COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND
THE PRINTER LISTENED ONLY TO THE FIRST SENTENCE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IMPATIENTLY
FILTHY HE WAILED
EXCEPT WHEN SHE MAKES A FOOL OF HERSELF LIKE SHE DID WITH YOU
SHE HAS DENIED US OUR RIGHT TO RULE OURSELVES--A RIGHT GUARANTEED IN OUR CHARTER
NORTH AMERICA FIGURED ON MARSPORT FOLDING UP ONCE THEY GOT A POLICE WAR STARTED WITH A BUNCH OF CHISELING PROFITEERS AS THEIR FRONT
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU--BECAUSE I HAVE TO HE SWALLOWED AND THE THIN HAND OF THE WOMAN LIFTED BRANDY TO HIS LIPS
HERE HE FOLLOWED MOTHER COREY LEAVING BEHIND HIS FAVORITE KNIFE AND A BRAND-NEW DECK OF READER CARDS MARKED EXACTLY AS THE ONES GORDON HAD FIRST USED
HENDRIX APPEARED FINALLY
HE GLANCED BACK TOWARD THE ROCKET THAT STILL POINTED SKYWARD BACK ON THE FIELD AND THEN FORWARD TOWARD THE CITY OF MARSPORT SPRAWLING OUT IN A MESS OF SLUMS BEYOND THE EDGES OF THE DOME THAT HAD BEEN BUILT TO HOLD AIR OVER THE CENTRAL PART
THE DEAD MAN HAD BEEN CAUGHT WITH A HALF BAG OF FLOUR AND PART OF A CASE OF BEANS
WITH A CONTINUOUS MOTION HE SWITCHED THE KNIFE TO HIS LEFT HAND IN A THUMB-UP POSITION AND BROUGHT IT BACK
SHE DROPPED INTO THE SEAT VERY QUIETLY BUT HER BLOUSE TOUCHED HIS ARM
PROBABLY SECOND-GENERATION ONES CAN KEEP GOING AFTER WE'D PASS OUT
YEAH I KNOW
YEAH I KNOW
THE IDEA SPYING ON YOU GORDON PICKED THE GIRL UP ROUGHLY
BUT HE KEPT TO HIS OWN TERRITORY KNOWING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO BEYOND IT
RANDOLPH HAD BEEN SITTING IN A CHAIR BETWEEN TWO OF THE COPS BUT NOW HE LEAPED UP AND TRIED TO FLEE THROUGH THE BACK DOOR
THE MAN CHUCKLED GRIMLY
AND DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY GORDON WAS AFTER A THUG WHO WAS ATTEMPTING TO RUN AWAY
WHEN YOU KILL A MAN FOR HIS MONEY HE DOESN'T FEEL VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR REVIVING HIM HE STARTED TO COUNT THE MONEY
THE MAN WENT SAILING OVER GORDON'S HEAD TO CRASH INTO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING
AND YOU'LL TURN HONEST ALL OVER NOW YOU'RE IN UNIFORM
YOU EVEN LOOK HUMAN SHE BENT TO PICK UP A SHOULDER PACK AND A BAG AND HER FACE WAS NORMAL WHEN SHE STOOD UP AGAIN
HE BUCKLED IT TO A STRAP
WHAT DID TRENCH WANT HE ASKED THICKLY
HE WAS PASSED WITH A NOD AND HEADED FOR THE LITTLE CLOSED-OFF POLLING PLACE
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE A SECURITY PRIME
I'M NOT GREEDY THE STRAIN OF WATCHING THE GAMES UNTIL HE COULD SPOT THE FIX AND THEN HOLDING THE CROUPIER DOWN HAD LEFT HIM MOMENTARILY WEAK BUT GORDON COULD STILL FEEL THE TENSING OF THE CROWD
GORDON CHUCKLED
THE BOOK WITH ALL THE NAMES
HE HEARD HER CRY OUT AND TURNED TO SEE HER CRASH INTO THE STOMACH OF A MAN WITH A HALF-RAISED STICK
BUT IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD UP THE PRESSURE OF OVER TEN POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH AND THE WEBBING WAS ANCHORED IN A METAL SLEEVE THAT WENT TOO HIGH FOR CUTTING
PLUMBING AND SUCH LUXURIES APPARENTLY HADN'T EXISTED FOR YEARS--EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL CISTERN AND WORN WATER-RECOVERY PLANT IN THE BASEMENT BESIDE THE TIRED-LOOKING WEEDS IN THE HYDROPONIC TANKS THAT TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO KEEP THE AIR BREATHABLE
GORDON NOTICED THAT WORKMEN WERE BUSY SETTING UP A HEAVY WOODEN GATE IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE PLACE
IF THEY FOUGHT BACK THE PUGNACIOUSNESS WAS KNOCKED OUT OF THEM AT ONCE
HE WADDLED BACK TO COME OUT WITH A TOWEL AND KEY WHICH HE HANDED TO MURDOCH
YOU LOOK WORSE THAN I DO COBBER
HE WENT DOWN WITH ALMOST NO RESISTANCE
YOU MUGS GET THE HELL OUT OF--OH COPS
GORDON DROPPED AND BEGAN CRAWLING IN THE ONLY DIRECTION THAT WAS OPEN STRAIGHT TOWARD THE ALLEYS FROM WHICH THE TRUCKS HAD COME
THE KID'S HAND SHAPED A C QUICKLY AND GORDON SLIPPED HIS ARM THROUGH A SELF-SEALING SLIT IN THE AIRSUIT AND BROUGHT OUT TWO OF THEM
AND SUDDENLY THE MARSPEAKER OVER THE ENTRANCE BLASTED INTO LIFE
HI GOV'NOR THE LITTLE MAN GREETED HIM
TOO BAD
THERE WERE NO MACHINE GUNS THIS TIME
HE'D MADE HIS BIG SCOOP ALL RIGHT
HE GAVE THE OLD GUY HIS MONEY BACK THEY TOOK BRUCE GORDON'S TESTIMONY AND SENT HIM HOME
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF SHEILA NEAR THE DOME
HE SAGGED DOWN THE WALL LIMPLY
MAY HAVE TO GO BACK TONIGHT GORDON LEFT THEM DISCUSSING THE MYTHICAL SEARCH FOR CERTAIN SUPPLIES THAT MOTHER COREY HAD APPARENTLY USED AS AN ALIBI FOR THEIR ABSENCE FROM THE BUILDING
IF I CAN'T EVEN KEEP MY WORD TO YOU I CAN AT LEAST GET OUT AND STAY OUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WAITING FOR HER DENUNCIATION
THEN HE LOOKED UP
GOV'NOR YOU'D BETTER TELL MY MOTHER I'LL BE USING THE OLD SHEETS
HOLDING THE ENTRANCE HE REACHED FOR THE DARK MAN WITH ONE HAND AND TOSSED HIM ON TOP OF THE GIANT
AND I'M UP TO MY NECK IN IT
HE STEPPED THROUGH DRAWING IT SHUT BEHIND HIM WHILE HIS EYES CHECKED THE POSITION OF HIS GUN AT HIS HIP
MOST OF THEM BELONGED TO NICK THE CROOP WHO HAD APPARENTLY DECIDED THE LEGALS WOULD WIN
THANKS GORDON
THANKS GORDON
THE CAPTAIN'S FACE HAD BEEN BURIED IN A PILE OF PAPERS BUT NOW MURDOCH CAME AROUND TO STARE AT THE GANG LEADER
HE HAD SOME CASH AND A SET OF READER CARDS IN HIS POCKET
HE'S REGISTERED SO HE VOTES THE NEXT MAN GORDON RECOGNIZED AS BEING FROM ONE OF THE SMALL SHOPS ON HIS BEAT
IZZY GRINNED SUDDENLY AT THE SIGHT OF THE UNIFORM
THE HORROR OF RUPTURING THE DOME WAS STRONGLY INGRAINED IN EVERY CITIZEN OF MARSPORT
GET ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB THEY MUG YOU
HE GRINNED AT HIMSELF THEN SOMETHING NEEDLED AT HIS MIND UNTIL HE SWUNG BACK
I'LL BE DOGGONED
THEN SHE SAW HIM AND HER JAW DROPPED OPEN SLACKLY
CITIZENS OF MARSPORT
THEN HE STEPPED THROUGH THE DOOR CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BIG BRUISER HADN'T COME BACK
AND EVERY CROOK HERE IS SCARED TO DEATH OF THE NAME
GORDON WAS MET THERE BY BLANK FACES AND AVERTED LOOKS BUT SOMEONE NODDED TOWARD TRENCH'S OFFICE AND HE WENT INSIDE
GORDON DROPPED FROM THE RUBBLE STARING AT THE BANK
BUT THEY'RE AROUND BRUCE GORDON FELT SOMETHING RUN DOWN HIS ARMPIT AND A CHILL CREEP UP HIS BACK
FOR ONCE HE HAD MONEY TO SHOW FOR THE WEEK
HIS HAND SNAPPED DOWN SHARPLY FOR A ROCK ON THE STREET
AND NOW SECURITY'S GOT PAN-ASIA AND UNITED AFRICA BALANCED AGAINST NORTH AMERICA SO THE SWIPE WON'T WORK
AND THEY'RE ADAPTING
FATS PLUCKED A SHEAF OF MARTIAN BANK NOTES FROM HIS POCKET AND TOSSED THEM TO THE CROUPIER
DAMN THAT MAXIE--I TOLD HIM TO BE DISCREET
IZZY'S FACE TENSED AND HE SWORE
ON THE POORER SECTION OF THE BEAT THERE WAS A SPIRITLESS HOPE THAT NOLAN MIGHT COME IN WITH HIS REFORM PROGRAM
ISAIAH TRENCH WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD
HE'D GONE TO THE DOOR AND WAS PEERING OUT
YOU DAMNED FOOLS YOU SHOULD HAVE STUCK
HE LOOKED TIRED
THEN HE SELECTED WHAT HE HOPED WAS THE THINNEST SECTION OF THE ATTACKERS AND LEAPED FORWARD
I'LL GO HOME AND REST
I'VE GOT A WIFE WHO'S HOLDING ONTO A NOTEBOOK THAT BELONGS TO ME THEN
HE WALKED BACK WATCHING THE DULL-LOOKING PEOPLE CLOSING OFF THEIR HOMES AS THEY HAD DONE AT ELECTIONS
A STARTLED GRUNT CAME FROM THE INSTRUMENT FOLLOWED BY THE CLICKS OF HASTY SWITCHING
DETERGENT
AND SUDDENLY HE WAS SHAKING HER
HE'D SEEN ENOUGH BY THE ROCKET GLARE TO KNOW THAT HE WAS HEADED RIGHT
YES YES CONGRATULATIONS
IT WOULD BE WORSE TOMORROW HE SUPPOSED
THEN THE SHIFT WAS OVER
GORDON HESITATED AND THEN SWUNG OFF WOODENLY TO TAKE UP HIS NEW BEAT
WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS WAR GORDON FELT THE CROWD'S REACTION TWIST AGAIN AND HE HAD TO ADMIT THAT WAYNE HAD PLAYED HIS CARDS WELL
THE DOME HAD FAILED FROM NEGLECT AND THE BUILDINGS INSIDE HAD GROWN SHABBIER
GORDON YANKED OUT THE MAN'S WALLET BUT THERE WAS NO IDENTIFICATION
SHEILA FROWNED STARING AT HIM AND BEGAN SLIDING FROM HER SIDE REACHING FOR HER ROBE
IT'S IN THE MAIL TO THE REGISTER ALONG WITH THE TWENTY CREDITS
A WHISTLE HAD BEEN SHRILLING FOR MINUTES
SOMETHING SOFT UNDER HIS FEET THREW HIM DOWN
HE'D SEEN SUCH AN IDENTIFICATION PLATE ONCE BEFORE
IT WAS SOON OVER
GET HIM AWAY COBBER GET HIM AWAY GORDON FOUND TRENCH PACING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE SCOWLING UP AT IT
YOU'RE NEW GORDON
I HAD TO BRUCE
GORDON NODDED
GORDON NODDED
MEN WERE LEAPING FROM THE TRUCKS AND POURING INTO THE MOB OF PLANTERS FORCING THEIR WAY TOWARD THE BOOTH IN THE CENTER OF THE MESS
HE JOINED IZZY IN THE LOCKER ROOM SUMMING UP THE SITUATION
THEN HIS LEGS WERE UNDER HIM AND HE WAS SLIDING INTO THE BIG LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT WHERE THE METAL WOULD SHIELD HIM
BUT MAYOR WAYNE HAD ALL OF THE REST OF THE TOWN IN HIS HAND
AND YOU MIGHT PASS THE WORD ALONG THAT WE'RE DOING IT TO SAVE THE DOME
HE HAD VAGUELY EXPECTED TO SEE MORE OF MARS BUT FOR EIGHT HOURS THERE WAS ONLY THE BARE FLATNESS AND DUNES OF UNENDING SANDY SURFACE AND SCRAGGLY USELESS NATIVE PLANTS OPENED OUT TO THE SUN
WIFE OR PRISONER
THEN HE STOPPED
COULDN'T BE HELPED
ALL HAD TAKEN A SEVERE BEATING IN THE BRAWLS
THEN HE BROUGHT THE FINGER DOWN SHARPLY AND THE TWO LEAPED OUT
ALL RIGHT SHEILA HE SAID
THE STICKS DON'T HAVE STRONG MOBS AND THEY'LL PILE UP A HEAVY NOLAN VOTE
THE DESK CAPTAIN AT THE PRECINCT HOUSE GROANED AS THEY CAME IN THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD
DAMN YOU BRUCE GORDON
THE DOME HAD EXPLODED OUTWARDS WITH ONLY BITS OF IT FALLING BACK
THE BIG STAR POINT GANG HAD APPARENTLY GROWN TIRED OF THE INCREASING COST OF PROTECTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WAS ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNING FOR NOLAN
TO ME IT'S NOTHING HE CALLED OUT
WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD WITH ONE MYSELF
AFTER HIM AND SHOOT IN THE SHADOWS GORDON JERKED SHARPLY
AND WHO CAN AFFORD HOSPITALS
SMUGGLED TWO DECKS UP HERE
THERE'S A RUN THEN EVERYTHING IS RUINED
GORDON GRINNED TAUTLY STEPPED THROUGH AND PUSHED THE BLADE AGAINST THE INNER PLASTIC
ANY MUCKRAKERS THERE ONE GORDON SHOUTED BACK AND RAN TOWARD IT MOTIONING THE OTHERS TO FOLLOW
IZZY HAD BEEN WAITING AND FILLED HIM IN
YOU'RE A FIGHTER
