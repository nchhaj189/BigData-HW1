BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD HASTILY SURVEYED ALL THREE
DO YOU THINK SAID HE AN EARTHQUAKE IS COMING I DO WELL I THINK YOU ARE MISTAKEN WHAT
IT IS A CONTINUOUS ROAR
JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
HE FLED AWAY BUT NOT BEFORE HANS HAD SALUTED HIM WITH THE CUSTOMARY SAELLVERTU SPETELSK SAID HE
AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
MY UNCLE NOW TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN TO HANS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO EXPLORE THE INTERIOR OF THE VOLCANO TO ITS FARTHEST LIMITS
HE KNEW ALL THAT PART OF THE COAST PERFECTLY AND PROMISED TO TAKE US THE SHORTEST WAY
THIS ONE IS NOT LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET LONG AND I CAN JUDGE OF ITS SIZE WHEN IT SWEEPS OVER THE WATERS THE VERTICAL COILS OF ITS TAIL
FATIGUE PARALYSED MY LIMBS
THIS WORTHY COUPLE WERE FLEECING US JUST AS A SWISS INNKEEPER MIGHT HAVE DONE AND ESTIMATED THEIR IMPERFECT HOSPITALITY AT THE HIGHEST PRICE
THIS DIRECT QUESTION WENT TO THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
PREPARATIONS FOR BLASTING A PASSAGE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH SINCE THE START UPON THIS MARVELLOUS PILGRIMAGE I HAD BEEN THROUGH SO MANY ASTONISHMENTS THAT I MIGHT WELL BE EXCUSED FOR THINKING MYSELF WELL HARDENED AGAINST ANY FURTHER SURPRISE
AN INDUCTION COIL CARRIES THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE PILE INTO COMMUNICATION WITH A LANTERN OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
MARTHA HAD WITHOUT THINKING ANY HARM CLEARED OUT THE LARDER THE NIGHT BEFORE SO THAT NOW THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT IN THE HOUSE
IT WAS HALF LIGHT
IN MY EXCURSION I MET BUT FEW PEOPLE
AT SOME PLACES THE FLANKS OF THE MOUNTAIN FORMED AN ANGLE WITH THE HORIZON OF AT LEAST 36 DEGREES
IT WAS A HERD OF MASTODONS--NOT FOSSIL REMAINS BUT LIVING AND RESEMBLING THOSE THE BONES OF WHICH WERE FOUND IN THE MARSHES OF OHIO IN 1801
WE ARE TURNING AWAY FROM THE PRIMARY GRANITE
YET NEITHER EYES NOR EARS COULD BE SO UTTERLY DECEIVED
AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS
IN THE MIDST OF MY AGONY A NEW TERROR LAID HOLD OF ME
THANKS TO THE INTERNAL HEAT THE GRASS GROWS ON THEM TO SOME DEGREE OF PERFECTION
HE DELIVERED HIM HIS LETTERS FROM COPENHAGEN AND THEN FOLLOWED A SHORT CONVERSATION IN THE DANISH LANGUAGE THE PURPORT OF WHICH I WAS QUITE IGNORANT OF AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON
OUR VOICES ARE AUDIBLE TO EACH OTHER BUT OUR HANDS CANNOT TOUCH
HELP I LISTENED I WATCHED IN THE DARKNESS FOR AN ANSWER A CRY A MERE BREATH OF SOUND BUT NOTHING CAME
FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH WE MIGHT RECKON ON FOUR MONTHS SUPPLY
THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS
BUT THAT DID NOT PREVENT HER FROM LOVING ME VERY SINCERELY
MY UNCLE MADE MORE NOISE THAN EXECUTION AND THE GUIDE SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO HIS ENERGETIC DIRECTIONS
THE ICELANDER SLOWLY MOVED HIS HEAD AND CALMLY POINTING TO MY UNCLE SAID
NO BOTTOM YET
I WAS HARDLY EXPECTING SO MUCH COMFORT
BUT HOW ABOUT OUR GUIDE OH NEVER MIND HIM
IT WAS TEN FEET BY FIVE
THE FEVER HAS LEFT YOU
I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO FIND A FEW WHICH I SEEM TO HAVE JOTTED DOWN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY
NOW IT APPEARED TO ME AS IF BREAKFAST WAS GOING TO BE WANTING JUST AS SUPPER HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THIS GOOD-NATURED GENTLEMAN MADE OVER TO US TWO OF THE THREE ROOMS WHICH HIS HOUSE CONTAINED AND WE WERE SOON INSTALLED IN IT WITH ALL OUR LUGGAGE THE ABUNDANCE OF WHICH RATHER ASTONISHED THE GOOD PEOPLE OF REJKIAVIK
AND IS HE GOING TO TAKE YOU WITH HIM I NODDED AGAIN
NO REPLIED MY UNCLE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE--QUITE IMPOSSIBLE YET I ANSWERED FEELING THE WALL THIS WELL IS BURNING HOT AT THE SAME MOMENT TOUCHING THE WATER I HAD TO WITHDRAW MY HAND IN HASTE
ALTHOUGH WE WERE TIRED OUR HEALTH WAS PERFECT AND THE MEDICINE CHEST HAD NOT YET HAD OCCASION TO BE OPENED
YET HE UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WELL WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN HIS TWO COMPANIONS
AT THIS RATE WE SHALL GET ON YES IF NOTHING STOPS US
THEN THE EBB AND FLOW HAVE NO SENSIBLE EFFECT AND THE BOAT DOES NOT RISK BEING CARRIED EITHER TO THE BOTTOM OR OUT TO SEA
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED AWAY
WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES
YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY MY UNCLE WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO EMPLOY MAGNIFICENT RESOURCES
I LOOKED AT HANS TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY
THESE WERE PERILOUS DESCENTS IN WHICH THE SKILL AND MARVELLOUS COOLNESS OF HANS WERE INVALUABLE TO US
IT WAS A VERY LONG SUCCESSION OF UNINTERESTING LOAMY AND FERTILE FLATS A VERY EASY COUNTRY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS AND PROPITIOUS FOR THE LAYING-DOWN OF THESE DIRECT LEVEL LINES SO DEAR TO RAILWAY COMPANIES
YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE
THE PERSPIRATION STREAMED FROM MY BODY
THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
AT ANY RATE IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE WERE NOT IN THE MAIN SHAFT OF THE VOLCANO BUT IN A LATERAL GALLERY WHERE THERE WERE FELT RECURRENT TUNES OF REACTION
YOU HAD FIRST WRITTEN OUT YOUR SENTENCE THE WRONG WAY AND DARTING UPON THE PAPER WITH EYES BEDIMMED AND VOICE CHOKED WITH EMOTION HE READ THE WHOLE DOCUMENT FROM THE LAST LETTER TO THE FIRST
THIS CONCERT WAS BROUGHT TO A CLOSE BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DINNER
THEN WE BESTRODE OUR STEEDS AND WITH HIS LAST ADIEU M
THIS FRAGMENT OF ROCK HAS BEEN SHAKEN DOWN BY SOME SHOCK OR CONVULSION OR BY ONE OF THOSE MAGNETIC STORMS WHICH AGITATE THESE REGIONS AND HAS BLOCKED UP THE PASSAGE WHICH LAY OPEN TO HIM
WE HAD TO CROSS A FEW NARROW FIORDS AND AT LAST QUITE A WIDE GULF
I WAS LED BY A PRESENTIMENT SOON TO BE REALISED
I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG OF WHICH PAUSANIAS SPEAKS
HERE WAS EVIDENTLY A CHANCE OF SAFETY
THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
GRANITE ROCKS SOFTEN
I HAVE BEEN GOING TOO FAST OR HANS AND MY UNCLE HAVE STOPPED ON THE WAY
LET US FIRST RETURN TO HANS HE SAID AND BRING THE RAFT TO THIS SPOT I OBEYED NOT WITHOUT DISSATISFACTION AND PASSED OUT RAPIDLY AMONG THE ROCKS ON THE SHORE
I WAS ONLY SUPPOSING A CASE OH VERY WELL ANSWERED M
I FELT THE SPIRE ROCKING WITH EVERY GUST OF WIND
AND NOW WITHOUT GIDDINESS FOR I WAS BEGINNING TO BE ACCUSTOMED TO THESE SUBLIME ASPECTS OF NATURE
IN SNEFFELS JOCULIS CRATEREM QUEM DELIBAT UMBRA SCARTARIS JULII INTRA CALENDAS DESCENDE AUDAX VIATOR ET TERRESTRE CENTRUM ATTINGES
I SAW THAT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE SMALLEST MATTER OF DETAIL
THE REST OF THE DAY WAS PASSED IN CALCULATIONS AND IN CONVERSATIONS
SIX PAIRS OF BOOTS AND SHOES MADE WATERPROOF WITH A COMPOSITION OF INDIARUBBER AND NAPHTHA WERE PACKED AMONGST THE TOOLS
IS IT NOT EVIDENT THAT THIS GALLERY WAS ONCE THE WAY OPEN TO THE COURSE OF THE LAVA AND THAT AT THAT TIME THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A FREE PASSAGE
THIS DENSE VEIL HUNG ACROSS THE SUN THREW A DEEP SHADOW OVER THE MOUNTAIN
WE ARE JUST AS IF WE WERE PEOPLE OF HAMBURG GOING TO LUEBECK BY WAY OF HANOVER I HAD BETTER HAVE KEPT MY OBSERVATIONS TO MYSELF
THESE ARE RUNIC LETTERS
OR WILL HE REAPPEAR ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA
FOR I MAY CONFESS IT TO YOU NOW THE PRETTY VIRLANDAISE AND THE PROFESSOR'S NEPHEW LOVED EACH OTHER WITH A PATIENCE AND A CALMNESS ENTIRELY GERMAN
FARVAL SAID HE ONE DAY
THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE
TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT
THOMSEN LIKE A GOOD FRIEND GAVE THE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK A CORDIAL GREETING AND HE EVEN VOUCHSAFED THE SAME KINDNESS TO HIS NEPHEW
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT TERROR HAD HOLD OF ME
IT MOST RESEMBLED THE MANE OF THE PRIMITIVE ELEPHANT
THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE
FRIDRIKSSEN THAT MY ENGAGEMENTS WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO ABSENT MYSELF OR I WOULD HAVE ACCOMPANIED YOU MYSELF WITH BOTH PLEASURE AND PROFIT OH NO NO REPLIED MY UNCLE WITH GREAT ANIMATION WE WOULD NOT DISTURB ANY ONE FOR THE WORLD M
GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR QUARTERS AND WE WERE CROSSING DIAGONALLY THE SOUTH-WEST QUARTER CALLED THE SUDVESTER FJORDUNGR ON LEAVING REJKIAVIK HANS TOOK US BY THE SEASHORE
DO YOU FEEL ILL MY UNCLE ASKED
BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
THE LIGHT FROM OUR APPARATUS REFLECTED FROM THE SMALL FACETS OF QUARTZ SHOT SPARKLING RAYS AT EVERY ANGLE AND I SEEMED TO BE MOVING THROUGH A DIAMOND WITHIN WHICH THE QUICKLY DARTING RAYS BROKE ACROSS EACH OTHER IN A THOUSAND FLASHING CORUSCATIONS
MASTER MASTER I SHOUTED
SOUTH-EAST BY EAST WELL ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR AFTER A RAPID CALCULATION I INFER THAT WE HAVE GONE EIGHTY-FIVE LEAGUES SINCE WE STARTED THEREFORE WE ARE UNDER MID-ATLANTIC TO BE SURE WE ARE AND PERHAPS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THERE IS A STORM ABOVE AND SHIPS OVER OUR HEADS ARE BEING RUDELY TOSSED BY THE TEMPEST QUITE PROBABLE AND WHALES ARE LASHING THE ROOF OF OUR PRISON WITH THEIR TAILS IT MAY BE AXEL BUT THEY WON'T SHAKE US HERE
TOWARDS MORNING THE ASCENDING MOVEMENT BECAME ACCELERATED
THE PAMPHLET ENTITLED GIGAN HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
FORWARD I CRIED
HE MOTIONED TO ME TO LOOK
THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE
I WAS AWARE OF THE GREAT POWERS OF VEGETATION THAT CHARACTERISE THESE PLANTS WHICH GROW AT A DEPTH OF TWELVE THOUSAND FEET REPRODUCE THEMSELVES UNDER A PRESSURE OF FOUR HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES AND SOMETIMES FORM BARRIERS STRONG ENOUGH TO IMPEDE THE COURSE OF A SHIP
I PERCEIVED AT ONCE THAT HE WAS EXAMINING TO FIND THE EXACT PLACE WHERE THE TORRENT COULD BE HEARD THE LOUDEST
HE OBSERVED THAT AT THE APPROACH OF THE KALENDS OF JULY THAT IS TO SAY IN THE LAST DAYS OF JUNE ONE OF THE PEAKS CALLED SCARTARIS FLUNG ITS SHADOW DOWN THE MOUTH OF THAT PARTICULAR CRATER AND HE COMMITTED THAT FACT TO HIS DOCUMENT
HER WORDS REVIVED ME
WE HAD NEITHER SAVAGES NOR WILD BEASTS TO FEAR I SUPPOSED
MY UNCLE EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE BY TREMENDOUS COMPRESSIONS OF BOTH HIS HANDS
AND IN THE MISTY EAST AND AWAY TO THE NORTH-EAST LAY OUTSTRETCHED THE FAINTLY-SHADOWED SHORES OF SWEDEN
HOW DRY AND HARD THE ROCK SEEMED TO ME
I WAS IN GREAT ALARM LEST SHE SHOULD TREAT ME TO THE ICELANDIC KISS
I COULD ONLY COMPARE IT TO THE HEAT OF A FURNACE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE MOLTEN METAL IS RUNNING INTO THE MOULD
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM AND TURNED TO MY UNCLE WHO WAS ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS CALCULATIONS
NOW AND THEN I LISTENED TO HEAR WHETHER A WELL-KNOWN STEP WAS ON THE STAIRS
IT WAS BUT ONE SIP BUT IT WAS ENOUGH TO RECALL MY EBBING LIFE
I KNEW OF CELEBRATED CAVERNS FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS OF TRAVELLERS BUT HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY OF SUCH DIMENSIONS AS THIS
YES CERTAINLY
COME SAID HE HAD YOU THIS WEAPON WITH YOU I
THE DIFFUSED LIGHT REVEALED THE SMALLEST OBJECT IN THE DENSE AND DISTANT THICKETS
MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
NO DOUBT FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR THE INCLINES HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY AND AT THIS RATE WE SHALL SOON ARRIVE UPON THE LEVEL SOIL OF ICELAND THE PROFESSOR NODDED SLOWLY AND UNEASILY LIKE A MAN THAT DECLINES TO BE CONVINCED
SUNNY LANDS IN THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN I FELT MYSELF GRASPED BY THE BELT WITH THE STRONG HAND OF OUR GUIDE
IT HAD BEEN IN THAT CORNER FOR SIX MONTHS LITTLE MINDFUL OF THE TROUBLE IT WAS GIVING
YOUR NAME GRAVEN FROM STAGE TO STAGE LEADS THE BOLD FOLLOWER OF YOUR FOOTSTEPS TO THE VERY CENTRE OF OUR PLANET'S CORE AND THERE AGAIN WE SHALL FIND YOUR OWN NAME WRITTEN WITH YOUR OWN HAND
I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE
THE LUGGAGE WAS PUT UPON A CARRIAGE AND TAKEN WITH OURSELVES TO THE PHOENIX HOTEL IN BREDA GATE
AND BESIDES I WAS GETTING USED TO THIS IDEA
FOR ONE SHORT MOMENT I FELT A RAY OF HOPE SPEEDILY TO BE EXTINGUISHED
IT IS AS DESERT AS THE SHORE WAS
MY UNCLE EMPLOYED A VERY SIMPLE EXPEDIENT TO OBVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY
HANS BUT THESE WORDS WERE ONLY SPOKEN WITHIN ME
THE FIRE OF ZEAL KINDLED AFRESH IN ME
THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE TO A SPECIES OF LAUNCH NOT CALCULATED FOR SHALLOW WATER
GO AND PACK UP THERE WAS NO REPLY TO THIS
WHITHER ARE WE FLYING
GRAEUBEN I MURMURED
FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION BY WHICH THE SOUND CAME OF COURSE I SHOULD ARRIVE IN HIS PRESENCE IF MY STRENGTH DID NOT FAIL ME
IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION THE INITIAL LETTER IS AN M WITH A SUPERSCORE OVER IT
THEY DESCRIBED AROUND US GRADUALLY NARROWING CIRCLES
I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
MAY WE NOT DEPEND UPON ELECTRIC PHENOMENA TO GIVE US LIGHT
WAS IT NOT ALWAYS BELIEVED UNTIL FOURIER THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE INTERPLANETARY SPACES DECREASED PERPETUALLY
I SUPPOSE I HAD NOT TAKEN AS MANY LESSONS ON GULF EXPLORATION AS I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE IN THE FRELSERS KIRK AT COPENHAGEN
HE CARED NOTHING ABOUT FATIGUE AND RESOLVED TO SPEND SOME DAYS UPON THE MOUNTAIN
WE SOON ENTERED INTO A PINGSTAOER OR PARISH CALLED EJULBERG FROM WHOSE STEEPLE TWELVE O'CLOCK WOULD HAVE STRUCK IF ICELANDIC CHURCHES WERE RICH ENOUGH TO POSSESS CLOCKS
AND THERE WERE PROVISIONS TOO
AFTER A HASTY MEAL MY UNCLE AND THE HUNTER EMBARKED WHILST I REMAINED ON SHORE
BUT STILL I MAY BE PERMITTED YOU SHALL HAVE MY LEAVE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AXEL BUT NOT TO TALK IN THAT IRRATIONAL WAY I COULD SEE THE AWFUL PROFESSOR BURSTING THROUGH MY UNCLE'S SKIN AND I TOOK TIMELY WARNING
BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
WELL LET US ALLOW THE WATER TO RUN ON
BUT BEFORE GOING ANY FARTHER I MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS TO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE WE HAVE GONE OVER AND NOTE THEM IN MY JOURNAL
MARCH HE HAD BETTER HAVE SAID SLIDE FOR WE DID NOTHING BUT DROP DOWN THE STEEP INCLINES
HE WAS CONVERSING IN THE DANISH LANGUAGE WITH A TALL MAN OF ROBUST BUILD
WHEN TWO HUNDRED FEET DOWN IT WOULD BE EASY TO GET POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF THE ROPE BY LETTING ONE END GO AND PULLING DOWN BY THE OTHER
IT WAS MY UNCLE'S OWN VOICE
THE STREAM WAS NO LONGER AT MY FEET
ARNE SAKNUSSEMM HE CRIED IN TRIUMPH
I REPEAT TO YOU THE LOVE OF READING RUNS IN ICELANDIC BLOOD
LOOK ABOUT AND WONDERFULLY INTERESTED WE PEERED ALL ALONG THE HIGH WALL PEEPING INTO EVERY FISSURE WHICH MIGHT OPEN OUT INTO A GALLERY
WE MOVED ON ALMOST WITHOUT A WORD
BUT NO THERE WAS DEAD SILENCE
IF THIS COLUMN OF WATER IS 32,000 FEET HIGH--THAT IS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IT IS EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND ATMOSPHERES
TR IF I AM RIGHT I THOUGHT I MUST SOON FIND SOME FOSSIL REMAINS OF PRIMITIVE LIFE
POOR BOY SAID HE IN GENUINE TONES OF COMPASSION
ARE YOU BLIND TO THE DENSE VAPOURS AND STEAM GROWING THICKER AND DENSER EVERY MINUTE
BUT HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MAN OF MY UNDECIDED TURN OF MIND TO ARGUE SUCCESSFULLY WITH SO IRASCIBLE A PERSON AS THE PROFESSOR
ZIGZAG STREAMS OF BLUISH WHITE FIRE DASH DOWN UPON THE SEA AND REBOUND AND THEN TAKE AN UPWARD FLIGHT TILL THEY STRIKE THE GRANITE VAULT THAT OVERARCHES OUR HEADS
AT SUCH A DEPTH BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH NO DOUBT
CHAPTER XLII
I WAS THEREFORE MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE A CLEAR LIGHT SHINING NEAR ME
ALL LIFE IS CONCENTRATED IN MY BEATING HEART ALONE
I AM LOOKING OUT FOR SOMETHING BETTER WHAT CAN YOU MEAN
A NIGHT GLASS
VERY GOOD SAID MY UNCLE
WHAT THEN WOULD BE THOSE CONVULSED REGIONS UPON WHICH WE WERE ADVANCING REGIONS SUBJECT TO THE DIRE PHENOMENA OF ERUPTIONS THE OFFSPRING OF VOLCANIC EXPLOSIONS AND SUBTERRANEAN CONVULSIONS
SEE THIS AGITATED COMPASS NEEDLE
JUST UPON THE EDGE APPEARED THE SNOWY PEAK OF SARIS STANDING OUT SHARP AND CLEAR AGAINST ENDLESS SPACE
BELOW THE FREEZING POINT
THE DIM LIGHT COULD NOT SHOW US BOTH ITS WALLS AT ONCE
WE WERE IN A SORT OF CAVERN WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF AIR
IT IS TRUE THAT IN THE THIRD LINE WAS THE WORD TABILED WHICH LOOKED LIKE HEBREW AND IN THE LAST THE PURELY FRENCH WORDS MER ARC MERE ALL THIS WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE A POOR FELLOW CRAZY
HE DIVIDED THEM INTO THREE EQUAL PORTIONS AND GAVE ONE TO EACH
YES MY POOR BOY I KNEW THAT AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVED AT THESE CROSS ROADS YOU WOULD DROP HALF DEAD AND I KEPT MY LAST DROP OF WATER TO REANIMATE YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I SAID
AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION MY UNCLE PRONOUNCED HIS OPINION
THAT COMPASS
I CAN HARDLY CALL IT PERILOUS FOR I WAS BEGINNING TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS KIND OF EXERCISE
I SHOUTED
THE HORRIBLE DISEASE OF LEPROSY IS TOO COMMON IN ICELAND
IT SEEMED LIKE AN IMMENSE CEMETERY WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER
A SMILE FLITTED ACROSS THE LIP OF MY SEVERE COMPANION AND HE ANSWERED
HAPPILY NO GREAT HARM CAME OF IT
THURSDAY AUG
IT MUST BE FROM SOME PHENOMENON PROCEEDING IN THE GREAT DEPTHS AMIDST WHICH I LAY HELPLESS
THE CAPE IS MERELY A LOW HILL WITH STEEP SIDES STANDING LONELY BY THE BEACH
HE WOULD INSIST UPON GOING
NOR THAT EITHER HE ANSWERED
FRIDRIKSSEN
FRIDRIKSSEN
FRIDRIKSSEN
FRIDRIKSSEN
FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES
THERE WE MUST MEET WITH ABUNDANT SPRINGS
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
AS FOR THE FAMILY TO WHICH IT BELONGS IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN
AND IN THE MIDST OF THE DOCUMENT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD LINES I OBSERVED THE WORDS ROTS MUTABILE IRA NET ATRA COME NOW I THOUGHT THESE WORDS SEEM TO JUSTIFY MY UNCLE'S VIEW ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE DOCUMENT
A CAGED LOVER'S FEELINGS MAY EASILY BE IMAGINED
BUT IN LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DISTINGUISH SOME HALF-EFFACED LETTERS
BUT WITH THE HELP OF THIS OUTFLOW THE THICKNESS OF THE CRUST OF THE ISLAND INCREASED MATERIALLY AND THEREFORE ALSO ITS POWERS OF RESISTANCE
I DARED NOT EXPRESS IT IN PLAIN TERMS
CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION BETWEEN THE MUSEUMS OF GREAT CITIES
AND THIS WOULD MAKE THREE HUNDRED LEAGUES MORE YES AND THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WOULD BE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM SHORE TO SHORE
HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY ST MICHEL AT BORDEAUX PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES
IT WAS AT THAT VERY MOMENT THAT I MUST HAVE GONE ON
THE TRANSLATION IS BY FREDERICK AMADEUS MALLESON
THEN CAME MY UNCLE AND MYSELF LOOKING NOT SO VERY ILL-MOUNTED ON OUR SMALL BUT HARDY ANIMALS
YES MY UNCLE REPLIED THE LIEDENBROCK SEA
THE OCEAN IS SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN TO ITS FARTHEST LIMIT
THEN THERE WAS A HALT
MY UNCLE SOON DISCOVERED WHAT SORT OF A MAN HE HAD TO DO WITH
WE WILL CALL IT AFTER HIS NAME AGREED I CRIED
THE RAFT SHOT TWENTY FATHOMS OUT TO SEA
GIGANTEO IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE
THESE HINTS ALONE GAVE ME THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE TRUTH
THE FATIGUES OF OUR PASSAGE ACROSS THE DANGERS MET HAD ALL TO BE BEGUN OVER AGAIN
1]THE NAME GIVEN BY SIR RODERICK MURCHISON TO A VAST SERIES OF FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE NON-FOSSILIFEROUS SLATY SCHISTS BELOW AND THE OLD RED SANDSTONE ABOVE
GEOLOGISTS CONSIDER THIS PRIMITIVE MATTER TO BE THE BASE OF THE MINERAL CRUST OF THE EARTH AND HAVE ASCERTAINED IT TO BE COMPOSED OF THREE DIFFERENT FORMATIONS SCHIST GNEISS AND MICA SCHIST RESTING UPON THAT UNCHANGEABLE FOUNDATION THE GRANITE
AS A TRUE NEPHEW OF THE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK AND IN SPITE OF MY DISMAL PROSPECTS I COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING WITH INTEREST THE MINERALOGICAL CURIOSITIES WHICH LAY ABOUT ME AS IN A VAST MUSEUM AND I CONSTRUCTED FOR MYSELF A COMPLETE GEOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF ICELAND
5
NO THERE'S A PULL AT THE LINE
THE MAMMALS DISAPPEAR THEN THE BIRDS VANISH THEN THE REPTILES OF THE SECONDARY PERIOD AND FINALLY THE FISH THE CRUSTACEANS MOLLUSCS AND ARTICULATED BEINGS
THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW US STRETCHED THE SEA
THE RULING THOUGHT GAVE HIM NO REST
WHY HAD I NOT THOUGHT OF THAT SOONER
I STOOD ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE SOUTHERNMOST OF SNAEFELL'S PEAKS
ABOUT NOON A DISTANT NOISE IS HEARD
THE TOWN EXTENDS ALONG A LOW AND MARSHY LEVEL BETWEEN TWO HILLS
CHAPTER II
ON THEIR BANKS GREW TREE-FERNS SIMILAR TO THOSE WE GROW IN HOTHOUSES
THE GALLERY DIPPED DOWN A VERY LITTLE WAY FROM THE HORIZONTAL SCARCELY MORE THAN TWO INCHES IN A FATHOM AND THE STREAM RAN GENTLY MURMURING AT OUR FEET
I ROSE FROM MY GRANITE BED AND WENT OUT TO ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE THAT LAY UNROLLED BEFORE ME
CHAPTER IV
THE WHOLE THING IS NON-EXISTENT
CHAPTER VI
IT IS ONLY A FOREST OF MUSHROOMS SAID HE
I WILL NOT YIELD
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
HIS EYES GLISTENED AND SPARKLED WITH LIVE FIRE HIS HAND WAS SHAKEN THREATENINGLY
AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED
I IMAGINED THE TORRENTS OF FIRE HURLED BACK AT EVERY ANGLE IN THE GALLERY AND THE ACCUMULATION OF INTENSELY HEATED VAPOURS IN THE MIDST OF THIS CONFINED CHANNEL
WAS HEISZT DIESEN BERG MEIN KNABLEIN
MY UNCLE AT ONCE FASTENED UPON THIS AS THE CENTRE OF INTEREST AND HE LABOURED AT THAT BLOT UNTIL BY THE HELP OF HIS MICROSCOPE HE ENDED BY MAKING OUT THE FOLLOWING RUNIC CHARACTERS WHICH HE READ WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
AND IF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIEVES WE WERE VERY LIKELY TO FRIGHTEN THEM
THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER
WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK HE WAS EXCLAIMING
HE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR ME
AND OFTEN BETWEEN TWO SEPARATED FIELDS OF CLOUD THERE GLIDED DOWN A RAY OF UNSPEAKABLE LUSTRE
SOMETIMES WE COULD SEE A HAWK BALANCING HIMSELF ON HIS WINGS UNDER THE GREY CLOUD AND THEN DARTING AWAY SOUTH WITH RAPID FLIGHT
MY PARTED LIPS SUFFICIENTLY REVEALED MY SUFFERINGS
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT UNDER SO POWERFUL A PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE COULD BE NO EVAPORATION
EXCELLENT CRIED MY UNCLE TO THE GREAT SCANDAL OF THE PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY
NONE CAN TELL
MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT
SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS ALONE COULD HAVE ANY WEIGHT WITH PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
THE ONE WAS READY TO ACCEPT WHATEVER WAS OFFERED
THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED A CRYPTOGRAM OR CIPHER HE SAID IN WHICH LETTERS ARE PURPOSELY THROWN IN CONFUSION WHICH IF PROPERLY ARRANGED WOULD REVEAL THEIR SENSE
THE LOOSE STONES CAUGHT WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE BLASTS OF WIND FLEW ABOUT IN A PERFECT HAIL AS IN AN ERUPTION
ALONG ITS GRANITE FLOOR RAN OUR FAITHFUL STREAM
THEREFORE IN THIS CASE THE THEORY OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY SAKNUSSEMM'S DOCUMENT AND MY UNCLE'S THEORIES WOULD ALL GO OFF IN SMOKE
IT LIES MOTIONLESS AS IF ASLEEP
THEN CAME DARK CHERRY-COLOURED MARBLES RELIEVED BY THE LIGHTER TINTS OF LIMESTONE
THAT UNIMPASSIONED ICELANDER DEVOTED HIMSELF WITH INCOMPREHENSIBLE DELIBERATION
I FELT IT FLOWING OVER ME
IT IS EVIDENT THAT AT THAT MOMENT A DEVIATION HAD PRESENTED ITSELF BEFORE ME WHILST THE HANSBACH FOLLOWING THE CAPRICE OF ANOTHER INCLINE HAD GONE WITH MY COMPANIONS AWAY INTO UNKNOWN DEPTHS
THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION CONSISTED OF DRY LITTER THROWN INTO TWO WOODEN FRAMES PAINTED RED AND ORNAMENTED WITH ICELANDIC SENTENCES
I WILL CUT THE HALLIARDS IF NECESSARY
THEREFORE LISTEN TO MY PROPOSAL I CROSSED MY ARMS AND CONFRONTED MY UNCLE BOLDLY
IT IS CERTAINLY OLD ICELANDIC HE MUTTERED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
THE PRESSURE WAS TOO GREAT AND OUR EFFORTS WERE FRUITLESS
INSTEAD OF A GOOD AND LEARNED MAN HE FOUND A RUDE AND COARSE PEASANT
SEE THERE HE CRIED AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK
OTTO LIEDENBROCK HAD NO MISCHIEF IN HIM I WILLINGLY ALLOW THAT
SO THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE AND WE SHALL SET SAIL TO-MORROW I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A SHIP
IT WAS A FLIGHT A FALL LIKE THAT FEARFUL PULLING AND DRAGGING WHICH IS PECULIAR TO NIGHTMARE
HERE WAS THE VEGETATION OF THE TERTIARY PERIOD IN ITS FULLEST BLAZE OF MAGNIFICENCE
I THOUGHT MADNESS WAS COMING ON
I JUMPED ASHORE FOLLOWED BY MY UNCLE AND THE ICELANDER
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE FOR IN THE SILURIAN AGE THE SEAS CONTAINED AT LEAST FIFTEEN HUNDRED VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL SPECIES
THE PROFESSOR BENT HIS SHAGGY BROWS AND I FEARED I HAD SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED MY OWN SAFETY
BUT YOU PERHAPS NOT THAT I AM AWARE SAID THE PROFESSOR
TRUE IN THE AUGUST PRESENCE OF RHOMBOHEDRAL CRYSTALS RETINASPHALTIC RESINS GEHLENITES FASSAITES MOLYBDENITES TUNGSTATES OF MANGANESE AND TITANITE OF ZIRCONIUM WHY THE MOST FACILE OF TONGUES MAY MAKE A SLIP NOW AND THEN
NOW BEGIN MOVING THESE WORDS CHEERED ME UP
PERHAPS EVEN THE ORB OF DAY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN READY YET TO PLAY THE SPLENDID PART HE NOW ACTS
SUCH AS MY EYES BEHOLD THESE VIRGIN STORES SUCH THEY WILL BE WHEN THIS WORLD COMES TO AN END
YOU SAY THAT I AM SAFE AND SOUND NO DOUBT YOU ARE AND ALL MY LIMBS UNBROKEN CERTAINLY AND MY HEAD YOUR HEAD EXCEPT FOR A FEW BRUISES IS ALL RIGHT
THERE ARE WORDS CONSISTING OF CONSONANTS ONLY AS NRRLLS OTHERS ON THE OTHER HAND IN WHICH VOWELS PREDOMINATE AS FOR INSTANCE THE FIFTH UNEEIEF OR THE LAST BUT ONE OSEIBO
INVOLUNTARILY I BEGAN TO THINK OF ITS HEAT WHEN THE LAVA THROWN OUT BY SNAEFELL WAS BOILING AND WORKING THROUGH THIS NOW SILENT ROAD
I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE
RUHMKORFF IS A LEARNED AND MOST INGENIOUS MAN OF SCIENCE
WE PUSHED ON IMPELLED BY OUR BURNING CURIOSITY
BUT I HAVE GOT AN IDEA WELL WHY SHOULD WE TROUBLE OURSELVES TO STOP THE STREAM FROM COMING OUT AT ALL BECAUSE WELL I COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON
I CAME WITH AN OBJECT AND I MEAN TO ATTAIN IT
SO THEN THE DREAM IN WHICH I HAD HAD A VISION OF THE PREHISTORIC WORLD OF THE TERTIARY AND POST-TERTIARY PERIODS WAS NOW REALISED
WHO BUT HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT YES
COME AWAY UNCLE--COME
AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE HARBOUR MY UNCLE WHO WAS TENACIOUSLY FOND OF NAMING HIS NEW DISCOVERIES WANTED TO GIVE IT A NAME AND PROPOSED MINE AMONGST OTHERS
I REMARK THAT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAS A TENDENCY TO RELAPSE INTO AN IMPATIENT MOOD AND I MAKE A NOTE OF IT IN MY LOG
THANKS TO MARTHA'S INERADICABLE TATTLING THE NEWS THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD GONE TO DISCOVER A WAY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH HAD SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE CIVILISED WORLD
EXCELLENT REPLIED MY UNCLE
I THEN KNEW THAT THE HAND OF MAN HAD NOT HOLLOWED OUT THIS MINE
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES MY PRETTY VIRLANDAISE WAS FULLY INFORMED OF THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS
THIS WAS ONLY INVINCIBLE OBSTINACY
AS FOR ME I ADORED HER IF THERE IS SUCH A WORD IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE
THEN I EXAMINE THE HORIZON WHICH IS UNBROKEN AND CLEAR OF ALL MIST
THIS FRIGHTFUL MASK OF ELECTRIC SPARKS SUGGESTS TO ME EVEN IN THIS DIZZY EXCITEMENT A COMPARISON WITH PRE-ADAMITE MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE MEGATHERIUM
NOW THIS WAS A LARGE LOAD FOR THE LADDER WAS 300 FEET LONG
THE OCCUPANT OF A PROFESSORIAL CHAIR AT THE JOHANNAEUM UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF A COSMICAL PHENOMENON
I KNEW QUITE WELL THAT ACCORDING TO THE BEST RECEIVED THEORIES THE MINERAL COVERING OF THE GLOBE IS NEVER AT ABSOLUTE REST
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THIS INDENTED IRON BAR
THAT IS SUFFICIENT
I HOPE AFTER OUR RETURN TO DRAW A MAP OF OUR JOURNEY WHICH WILL BE IN REALITY A VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLOBE CONTAINING THE TRACK OF OUR EXPEDITION THAT WILL BE CURIOUS UNCLE
IT IS A MAN I LOOKED SHAKING MY HEAD INCREDULOUSLY
AFTER ALL I THOUGHT THE KALENDS OF JULY ARE A LONG WAY OFF AND BETWEEN THIS AND THEN MANY THINGS MAY TAKE PLACE WHICH WILL CURE MY UNCLE OF HIS DESIRE TO TRAVEL UNDERGROUND
WHAT IS HE SAYING HE SAYS TIDE SAID MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD
NOW SAID MY UNCLE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME TO READ THE SENTENCE WHICH YOU HAVE JUST WRITTEN AND WITH WHICH I AM WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED I SHALL ONLY HAVE TO TAKE THE FIRST LETTER OF EACH WORD THEN THE SECOND THE THIRD AND SO FORTH AND MY UNCLE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT AND MY MUCH GREATER READ
WHAT DID IT MATTER TO HIM
I HAD UNDERSTOOD EVERY WORD OF IT AND I COULD HARDLY CONCEAL MY AMUSEMENT AT SEEING MY UNCLE TRYING TO KEEP DOWN THE EXCITEMENT AND SATISFACTION WHICH WERE BRIMMING OVER IN EVERY LIMB AND EVERY FEATURE
THE TORCH
HOWEVER ROUGHLY JOINED TOGETHER THOSE PLANKS AFFORDED US A FIRMER SUPPORT THAN WE COULD HAVE FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE
THIS FRIGHTFUL CONVEYANCE HAD THUS CARRIED ME INTO THE ARMS OF MY UNCLE WHERE I FELL BRUISED BLEEDING AND INSENSIBLE
FAHR HERE WAS CAUSE FOR REFLECTION
WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
WE MUST GIVE UP ALL HOPE OF PASSING IT
I WILL RETURN FOR HALF AN HOUR I CLIMBED UP
OTHER FLASHES WITH INCESSANT PLAY CROSS THEIR VIVID FIRES WHILE OTHERS AGAIN ROLL THEMSELVES INTO BALLS OF LIVING FIRE WHICH EXPLODE LIKE BOMBSHELLS BUT THE MUSIC OF WHICH SCARCELY-ADDS TO THE DIN OF THE BATTLE STRIFE THAT ALMOST DEPRIVES US OF OUR SENSES OF HEARING AND SIGHT
THIS CORD SEEMED A FRAGILE THING FOR THREE PERSONS TO BE SUSPENDED FROM
EARLY IN SUMMER THE FEMALE A VERY PRETTY BIRD GOES TO BUILD HER NEST AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE FIORDS WITH WHICH THE COAST IS FRINGED
WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT TO GO DOWN INTO A MORTAR PERHAPS A LOADED MORTAR TO BE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE BUT I DID NOT TRY TO BACK OUT OF IT
DESCEND BOLD TRAVELLER INTO THE CRATER OF THE JOKUL OF SNEFFELS WHICH THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS TOUCHES BEFORE THE KALENDS OF JULY AND YOU WILL ATTAIN THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH
THEIR FACES WERE AGREEABLE BUT EXPRESSIONLESS AND THEY WORE GOWNS AND PETTICOATS OF DARK VADMEL
THERE IS NOT A FARMER NOR A FISHERMAN THAT CANNOT READ AND DOES NOT READ
IT NEVER RETURNS TO MY MEMORY WITHOUT SENDING THROUGH ME A SHUDDER OF HORROR AND A PALPITATION OF THE HEART
CHAPTER XVI
SCARCELY COULD MY LIPS UTTER THE WORDS
IN THE DISTANCE SAYS THE PROFESSOR THERE IS A ROCK OR ISLET AGAINST WHICH THE SEA IS BREAKING HANS CLIMBS UP THE MAST BUT SEES NO BREAKERS
WELL THOSE ARE ONLY SULPHUREOUS FLAMES AND VAPOURS WHICH ONE MUST EXPECT TO SEE IN AN ERUPTION
THAT IS SNAEFELL THAT SNAEFELL IT IS
NOW SNAEFELL IS ONE OF THESE
THE RAFT LAY MOTIONLESS
BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS EXCESSIVELY RESERVED AND AT EVERY SENTENCE SPOKE TO ME WITH HIS EYES ENJOINING THE MOST ABSOLUTE SILENCE UPON OUR PLANS
IT WAS A GIANT ABLE TO CONTROL THOSE MONSTERS
FOR THE METALS THAT MOST RESIST THE ACTION OF HEAT GOLD AND PLATINUM AND THE HARDEST ROCKS CAN NEVER BE EITHER SOLID OR LIQUID UNDER SUCH A TEMPERATURE
I MADE NO DOUBT BUT THAT IT WOULD BE IN SOME NORTHERN REGION
OVER MY HEAD RAGGED CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING PAST AND BY AN OPTICAL INVERSION THEY SEEMED STATIONARY WHILE THE STEEPLE THE BALL AND I WERE ALL SPINNING ALONG WITH FANTASTIC SPEED
HAVE WE STRUCK LAND HANS POINTED WITH HIS FINGER AT A DARK MASS SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY RISING AND FALLING ALTERNATELY WITH HEAVY PLUNGES
WE ARE NOT DESCENDING AS WE OUGHT TO BE THE PROFESSOR DECLARES
IS THE JOURNEY NOT OVER THEN I OPENED A PAIR OF ASTONISHED EYES WHICH IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR THE QUESTION
RIGHT OR LEFT TOP OR BOTTOM THERE WAS NO ROAD FARTHER
CHAPTER XLIV
AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL WELL TAKE MY ARM AXEL AND LET US FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE SHORE I EAGERLY ACCEPTED AND WE BEGAN TO COAST ALONG THIS NEW SEA
I WAS TOUCHED WITH THESE WORDS NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO SEE THE EXCITABLE PROFESSOR IN A SOFTENED MOOD
THIS TIME THE PROFESSOR'S ONLY ANSWER WAS AN ANGRY GESTURE
BUT HOW WERE WE TO UNFASTEN IT WHEN ARRIVED AT THE OTHER END
THE ANSWER CAME IN THE MURMURING OF THE STREAM AT MY FEET
A FRESH NOISE IS HEARD
IT CAME TO AN ABRUPT END
BUT WE ENJOYED ABSOLUTE SAFETY AND UTTER SECLUSION
WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE
IN MANY PLACES DEPRESSIONS OR ELEVATIONS GAVE WITNESS TO SOME TREMENDOUS POWER EFFECTING THE DISLOCATION OF STRATA
YET THE PROFESSOR WATCHED EVERY ARTICLE WITH JEALOUS VIGILANCE UNTIL ALL WERE SAFE ON BOARD
THIS PROVES THE INGENIOUS CARE WITH WHICH SAKNUSSEMM GUARDED AND DEFINED HIS DISCOVERY
AND ALTHOUGH IT FLICKERED SO MUCH AS TO THREATEN TO GO OUT IT THREW A FITFUL LIGHT ACROSS THE AWFUL DARKNESS
WELL AXEL DEMANDED THE PROFESSOR IMPATIENTLY
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS WORD SCARTARIS AND WHAT HAVE THE KALENDS OF JULY TO DO WITH IT MY UNCLE TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO CONSIDER
ACCURSED ROCK I CRIED IN A PASSION FINDING MYSELF SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY AN IMPASSABLE OBSTACLE
THE WAVES BROKE ON THIS SHORE WITH THE HOLLOW ECHOING MURMUR PECULIAR TO VAST INCLOSED SPACES
HAMBURG THE HOUSE IN THE KOENIGSTRASSE MY POOR GRAEUBEN ALL THAT BUSY WORLD UNDERNEATH WHICH I WAS WANDERING ABOUT WAS PASSING IN RAPID CONFUSION BEFORE MY TERRIFIED MEMORY
LIEDENBROCK DON'T BE UNEASY WE SHALL GET THERE IN VERY GOOD TIME AT EVENING THE SCHOONER DOUBLED THE SKAW AT THE NORTHERN POINT OF DENMARK IN THE NIGHT PASSED THE SKAGER RACK SKIRTED NORWAY BY CAPE LINDNESS AND ENTERED THE NORTH SEA
THIS CEREMONY OVER WE SAT AT TABLE TWENTY-FOUR IN NUMBER AND THEREFORE ONE UPON ANOTHER
EVERYWHERE ELSE HER ART CONSISTS ALONE IN THROWING DOWN HUGE MASSES TOGETHER IN DISORDER
SO I FELT A LITTLE COMFORTED AS WE ADVANCED TO THE ASSAULT OF SNAEFELL
YOU WILL GET NOTHING FROM THAT IMMOVABLE SERVANT
IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE
BUT I FELT A DESIRE TO START AT ONCE AND NOT TO LOSE TIME AND COURAGE BY CALM REFLECTION
WHAT WAS HANS THINKING OF--THAT MAN OF THE FAR WEST BUT WHO SEEMED RULED BY THE FATALIST DOCTRINES OF THE EAST
I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS ME
EAT WHAT IS LEFT TO THE LAST CRUMB AND RECRUIT OUR FADING STRENGTH
A RELAPSE MIGHT GET US INTO TROUBLE AND WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE FOR THE VOYAGE MAY BE A LONG ONE THE VOYAGE YES REST TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW WE WILL SET SAIL SET SAIL!"--AND I ALMOST LEAPED UP
BUT I ADMIT THAT CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY UNDERSTOOD MAY TEND TO MODIFY IN PLACES THE ACTION OF NATURAL PHENOMENA
TONGUES OF FIRE LAPPED THE WALLS WHICH CRACKLED AND SPUTTERED UNDER THE INTENSE HEAT
THIS BLADE IS STEEL MY UNCLE STOPPED ME ABRUPTLY ON MY WAY TO A DISSERTATION WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME A LONG WAY AND SAID COOLLY
THE UNHAPPY BEING FORBORE TO APPROACH US AND OFFER HIS MISSHAPEN HAND
I ADMIT THAT SAKNUSSEMM MAY HAVE WRITTEN THESE LINES
I REALLY COULD DO NO LESS THAN ASK A QUESTION ABOUT ITS CONTENTS ALTHOUGH I DID NOT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST
HE WAS TALKING TO THE GUIDE
AND TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MASS WITHIN DID NOT STILL EXIST IN A STATE OF LIQUID INCANDESCENCE WAS ABSURD
YOU SEE CONES IMPERFECTLY FORMED IRREGULAR PYRAMIDS WITH A FANTASTIC DISARRANGEMENT OF LINES
I SEE A VAST INVERTED CONE RISING FROM THE SURFACE IS IT ANOTHER SEA BEAST PERHAPS IT IS THEN LET US STEER FARTHER WESTWARD FOR WE KNOW SOMETHING OF THE DANGER OF COMING ACROSS MONSTERS OF THAT SORT LET US GO STRAIGHT ON REPLIED MY UNCLE
MY UNCLE WAS WATCHING OVER ME TO DISCOVER THE LEAST SIGN OF LIFE
COME TO ME I AM DYING MY UNCLE RETRACED HIS STEPS
AXEL AXEL HE CRIED
DURING ALL DINNER TIME MY UNCLE WAS ALMOST MERRY
THE SPRAY ALMOST BLINDS US
I WAS STIRRED UP WITH EXCITEMENT
TEMPERATURE HIGH
I TRIED TO REPEL IT BUT IT WOULD RETURN
YES I CRIED
THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE IS AT THE PRESENT TIME ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED
YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
THE LIVING CONTENTS WERE HIS GOD-DAUGHTER GRAEUBEN A YOUNG VIRLANDAISE OF SEVENTEEN MARTHA AND MYSELF
WE WERE ALONE IN THE CARRIAGE BUT WE SAT IN SILENCE
SUDDENLY I HALTED
LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
BUT MY UNCLE SEEMED TO BELIEVE IN HIS ARSENAL AS IN HIS INSTRUMENTS AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF GUN COTTON WHICH IS UNAFFECTED BY MOISTURE AND THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF WHICH EXCEEDS THAT OF GUNPOWDER
THERMOMETER 6 DEG
HE IS THE DREADFUL ENEMY OF THE OTHER HANS HAD SPOKEN TRULY
MY VOICE FAILED
AT TEN IN THE MORNING AT LAST WE SET OUR FEET IN COPENHAGEN
BUT MY UNCLE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO THAT
IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE DESCENT HANS WOUND HIS WAY DOWN THE CONE BY A SPIRAL PATH
THIS IS NO NORTHERN MOUNTAIN
BUT I HAD NOT RECKONED UPON ONE LITTLE INCIDENT WHICH TURNED UP A FEW HOURS AFTER
ITS CITIES AND ITS SUNNY PLAINS HAMBURG AND THE KOENIGSTRASSE EVEN POOR GRAEUBEN WHO MUST HAVE GIVEN US UP FOR LOST ALL WERE FOR THE TIME DISMISSED FROM THE PAGES OF MY MEMORY
ITS LINES WANTED ACCURACY
THIS GRAVE PHLEGMATIC AND SILENT INDIVIDUAL WAS CALLED HANS BJELKE
THE FIRST OF MY SENSES WHICH CAME INTO PLAY AFTER THIS LAST BOUT WAS THAT OF HEARING
BUT THIS CREATURE SURPASSED IN STATURE ALL THE MEASUREMENTS KNOWN IN MODERN PALAEONTOLOGY
MORE THAN ONCE I DROPPED DOWN MOTIONLESS
THERM
HANS WAS APPROACHING
I SEEMED TO BE LOST IN SPACE
INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY SEEM HE RATTLED HIS PRECIOUS NODULES OF FLINTS TOGETHER
AS HIS NEPHEW AND AN ORPHAN I BECAME HIS LABORATORY ASSISTANT
MANY A TIME INSTEAD OF ENJOYING THE COMPANY OF LADS OF MY OWN AGE I HAD PREFERRED DUSTING THESE GRAPHITES ANTHRACITES COALS LIGNITES AND PEATS
BUT BEFORE IT HAS REACHED US THE RAIN CLOUD PARTS ASUNDER THE SEA BOILS AND THE ELECTRIC FIRES ARE BROUGHT INTO VIOLENT ACTION BY A MIGHTY CHEMICAL POWER THAT DESCENDS FROM THE HIGHER REGIONS
BUT THE PROFESSOR GAVE UP HIS IDEA OF ABANDONING THE RAFT AND IT WAS WELL HE DID
GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
MY SILENCE WAS TAKEN FOR CONSENT AND THE DESCENT WENT ON
VERY GOOD TOO OTHERS HAVE DONE AS MUCH WITHOUT DYING FOR IT
MY UNCLE HAD A CORDIAL LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO HIM
IT WAS NOT SO GLORIOUS BUT IT WAS SAFER
NO ONE IN THE HOUSE IS TO EAT ANYTHING AT ALL
OUR LAST EVENING WAS SPENT IN INTIMATE CONVERSATION WITH M
WE WERE NOW TO BEGIN TO ADOPT A MODE OF TRAVELLING BOTH MORE EXPEDITIOUS AND LESS FATIGUING THAN HITHERTO
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN HE KEPT REPEATING MECHANICALLY
BUT EVENING CAME AND NEITHER WISH WAS GRATIFIED
I COULD REMEMBER THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
HANS TOOK THE TOOLS
THE NAME OF LIEDENBROCK WAS HONOURABLY MENTIONED IN COLLEGES AND LEARNED SOCIETIES
SOON LURID LIGHTS BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE VERTICAL GALLERY WHICH WIDENED AS WE WENT UP
AT LAST ON TUESDAY JULY 8 WE ARRIVED ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES AND HALF DEAD AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO ROADS
AND YET IMAGINATION IS SUCH A STRONG THING THAT EVEN IN THIS SUPREME HOUR I WAS OCCUPIED WITH STRANGE AND ALMOST CHILDISH SPECULATIONS
IT IS EVIDENT THAT SAKNUSSEMM DID NOTHING MORE THAN THIS
THEN FOLLOWED STRONG LANGUAGE AND THE WHIP
BUT THE COMPASS
IT SEEMED AS IF THE GENII OF THE DEPTHS WERE LIGHTING UP THEIR PALACE TO RECEIVE THEIR TERRESTRIAL GUESTS
BUT I DID NOT ADVANCE THIS ARGUMENT
I WAS BURIED ALIVE WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE ME OF DYING OF HUNGER AND THIRST
MY HEAD THROBBED WITH EXCITEMENT AND I FELT AN UNDEFINED UNEASINESS
WE HAVE GOT THERE TO OUR JOURNEY'S END NO
BUT TO MY UNCLE IT WAS SUBLIME
IT IS THE CHRONICLE OF THE NORWEGIAN PRINCES WHO RULED IN ICELAND INDEED I CRIED KEEPING UP WONDERFULLY OF COURSE IT IS A GERMAN TRANSLATION WHAT SHARPLY REPLIED THE PROFESSOR A TRANSLATION
I FANCY IT WILL NEVER FAIL NEVER MIND WE CANNOT BE SURE
IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS THE VEGETABLE ACCUMULATIONS FIRST BECAME PEAT
SEE SEE MY UNCLE I CRIED
LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE
THOU MARVELLOUS GENIUS HE CRIED THOU HAST NOT FORGOTTEN ONE INDICATION WHICH MIGHT SERVE TO LAY OPEN TO MORTALS THE ROAD THROUGH THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST
I STARED AT OUR FAILING SUPPLIES STUPIDLY
THE PROFESSOR ATE HIS GREEDILY WITH A KIND OF FEVERISH RAGE
HERE IS ONE OF THE BEST MAPS OF ICELAND THAT OF HANDERSEN AND I BELIEVE THIS WILL SOLVE THE WORST OF OUR DIFFICULTIES I BENT OVER THE MAP
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING WE LANDED AT KORSOR A SMALL TOWN ON THE WEST COAST OF ZEALAND
BEFORE OUR EYES LAY FAR AND WIDE A VAST SEA
IT IS DIVING DOWN THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR
AND WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT I MADE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF LOFTY CONTEMPLATIONS CHAPTER IX
SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF AN ENORMOUS PERFORATED ROCK THROUGH WHICH THE SEA DASHED FURIOUSLY
WHEN WE HAD LAID ASIDE OUR TRAVELLING WRAPS THE VOICE OF THE HOST WAS HEARD INVITING US TO THE KITCHEN THE ONLY ROOM WHERE A FIRE WAS LIGHTED EVEN IN THE SEVEREST COLD
OUR RAFT SKIRTED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE FUCI THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET LONG UNDULATING LIKE VAST SERPENTS BEYOND THE REACH OF SIGHT
DO YOU YET DOUBT I MADE NO ANSWER
BUT THERE WAS NO HOPE HERE
THE WISEST COURSE WAS TO REMAIN WHERE I WAS
THESE LETTERS NAMED ONE AT A TIME HAD CARRIED NO SENSE TO MY MIND
I HAD TO FOLLOW CLUTCHING AT EVERY STEP
I STOOPED TO BATHE MY FACE IN THE HANSBACH
WHEN OUR GOOD MARTHA WANTED TO GO TO MARKET SHE FOUND THE DOOR LOCKED
A GREAT GULF HAD OPENED
LE BARON TRAMPE HIMSELF
WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL
YET I WANTED TO PENETRATE FARTHER UNDERNEATH THOUGH A CHILL FELL UPON ME AS SOON AS I CAME UNDER THOSE CELLULAR VAULTS
THEN THE ROAD BECAME MONOTONOUSLY EASY
THEY RENT ASUNDER LIKE A CURTAIN
IT IS THE WAVES THAT UNDULATE UPON ITS SIDES
COME COME I RAN
BUT WHO COULD HAVE FORETOLD THE RESULT
AT MY FIRST SIGH HE TOOK MY HAND
SHE UNDERTOOK TO PACK UP ALL THINGS NECESSARY FOR MY VOYAGE
ON THURSDAY AT 8 A.M WE STARTED AFRESH
THE CASTLE OF KRONSBERG SOON DISAPPEARED IN THE MIST AS WELL AS THE TOWER OF HELSINGBORG BUILT ON THE SWEDISH COAST AND THE SCHOONER PASSED LIGHTLY ON HER WAY URGED BY THE BREEZES OF THE CATTEGAT
IN THIS COUNTRY THERE WERE NO ROADS AND PATHS AND THE POOR VEGETATION HOWEVER SLOW WOULD SOON EFFACE THE RARE TRAVELLERS FOOTSTEPS
THE HUNTER SHOOK HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF COMPLETE IGNORANCE
I SCARCELY DARED TO SHUT MY EYES FOR ONE MOMENT FOR FEAR OF LOSING THE LEAST GLIMMER OF THIS PRECIOUS LIGHT
WHEN I AWOKE I HEARD MY UNCLE TALKING AT A GREAT RATE IN THE NEXT ROOM
AND IS THE TYPE GOOD TYPE
SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY
HE SAT AT ONE END OF HIS TABLE I AT THE OTHER
I SPENT AN AWFUL NIGHT
I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING ENTITLED GIGAN HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM--THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
HERE IS ALL WE HAVE LEFT
NIGHT CAME ON
I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
AT LAST BY A VIOLENT EFFORT I RELEASE MYSELF AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE BALL IN ITS GYRATIONS WAS ABOUT TO SEIZE UPON IT AND CARRY ME OFF MY FEET
CHAPTER XXXIII
IN FACT THE GREAT PLUTONIC ACTION IS CONFINED TO THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE ISLAND
YOU LOVE GRAEUBEN HE WENT ON ONCE OR TWICE DREAMILY
LET US SUP HANS PREPARED SOME FOOD
BUT WE MUST CAREFULLY AVOID THIS WATERSPOUT WHICH WOULD SINK OUR RAFT IN A MOMENT HANS STEERING WITH HIS USUAL SKILL BROUGHT US TO THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE ISLET
THIS POINT BEING SETTLED HANS GAVE THE SIGNAL AND WE SOON LEFT STAPI BEHIND US
ACCORDING TO THE COMPASS WE HAVE GONE NORTHWARD HAS IT LIED SURELY NOT
IT WAS THE MAP OF M
IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK
MY BODY IS NO LONGER FIRM AND TERRESTRIAL
I UTTERED A CRY AND FELL
WE HAD NEITHER COLD NOR INTRUSIVE VISITS TO FEAR
I WAS TERRIBLY EXCITED
BUT THAT COLUMN OF WATER GEYSER SAID HANS
THE PROVISION CASE WAS OPENED
THE WORKING OF SUCH DEEP MINES WOULD INVOLVE TOO LARGE AN OUTLAY AND WHERE WOULD BE THE USE AS LONG AS COAL IS YET SPREAD FAR AND WIDE NEAR THE SURFACE
AT OUR ENTRANCE THE HOST AS IF HE HAD NEVER SEEN US GREETED US WITH THE WORD SAELLVERTU WHICH MEANS BE HAPPY AND CAME AND KISSED US ON THE CHEEK
LONG HAIR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED RED EVEN IN ENGLAND FELL IN LONG MESHES UPON HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
HANS CLOSED HIS EYES WITH LAZY INDIFFERENCE
ITS HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO LETTERS SEEMED TO FLUTTER AND FLY AROUND ME LIKE THOSE MOTES OF MINGLED LIGHT AND DARKNESS WHICH FLOAT IN THE AIR AROUND THE HEAD WHEN THE BLOOD IS RUSHING UPWARDS WITH UNDUE VIOLENCE
BUT THE SAVANTS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY GENERALLY WROTE IN LATIN
FIRST SAID HE I WILL MAKE A CALCULATION TO ASCERTAIN OUR EXACT POSITION
THE PICK HAD SOON PENETRATED TWO FEET INTO THE GRANITE PARTITION AND OUR MAN HAD WORKED FOR ABOVE AN HOUR
IT WAS WORTH WHILE DEBATING THIS QUESTION AND I DID DEBATE IT
THE PROBABLE RAGE OF THE CONQUEROR INSPIRES US WITH INTENSE FEAR
AND THERE WERE BITUMENS RESINS ORGANIC SALTS TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE LEAST GRAIN OF DUST
BUT THE RESULT OF THIS FIRST CONVERSATION WAS THAT BARON TRAMPE PLACED HIMSELF ENTIRELY AT THE SERVICE OF PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
THESE WERE THE KITCHEN THE WEAVING SHOP THE BADSTOFA OR FAMILY SLEEPING-ROOM AND THE VISITORS ROOM WHICH WAS THE BEST OF ALL
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WISE TO TELL HOW WE CAME THERE
WE MUST LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND WE SHALL GET ON AT THE RATE OF THIRTY MILES A DAY WE MAY
HERE'S A REMARKABLE BOOK
YET ANOTHER HALF HOUR ANOTHER HALF LEAGUE WAS PASSED
WHY SHOULD IT NOT AT A CERTAIN DEPTH ATTAIN AN IMPASSABLE LIMIT INSTEAD OF RISING TO SUCH A POINT AS TO FUSE THE MOST INFUSIBLE METALS AS MY UNCLE WAS NOW TAKING HIS STAND UPON HYPOTHESES OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SAID
I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TREATISES OF CASSANION AND ALL THOSE MEMOIRS PAMPHLETS ANSWERS AND REJOINDERS PUBLISHED RESPECTING THE SKELETON OF TEUTOBOCHUS THE INVADER OF GAUL DUG OUT OF A SANDPIT IN THE DAUPHINE IN 1613
THE THREE ICELANDERS JUST AS TACITURN AS THEIR COMRADE THE HUNTER NEVER SPOKE AND ATE THEIR BREAKFASTS IN SILENCE
LITTLE BY LITTLE MY BRAIN WEAKENED BY SO MANY CONSTANTLY REPEATED SHOCKS SEEMED TO BE GIVING WAY ALTOGETHER
SUPPOSE WE HAD TOUCHED WITH OUR PROW THE PROW OF A RUDDER THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHAT WOULD HAVE BECOME OF US
ONE LAST TREMBLING GLIMMER SHOT FEEBLY UP
FRIDRIKSSEN WITH LATIN FOR MY BENEFIT
I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
WAS IT AN EXPLOSION OF GAS
THE MANOMETER IS GENERALLY KNOWN AS A PRESSURE GAUGE.--TRANS
IT LIGHTED UP THE CALM AND UNMOVED COUNTENANCE OF HANS
AND THEY SOON PRESENT TO OUR VIEW A PONDEROUS MASS OF ALMOST LEVEL SURFACE
OUR MOUTHS OPEN OUR LIPS MOVE BUT NOT A WORD CAN BE HEARD
BUT HE LITTLE THINKS OF THE MARVELLOUS PART HE HAS TO PLAY IN THE FUTURE SO HE IS TO GO WITH US AS FAR AS AS FAR AS THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH AXEL FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WERE LEFT BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE
I CANNOT CONVEY MY IMPRESSIONS BY A BETTER COMPARISON
ET QUACUMQUE VIAM DEDENT FORTUNA SEQUAMUR THEREVER FORTUNE CLEARS A WAY THITHER OUR READY FOOTSTEPS STRAY CHAPTER XII
OF COURSE DOWN THIS FAULT THE HANSBACH FELL IN A CASCADE AND LOST SOME OF ITS VOLUME
COMPASSION FUSES THE PROFESSOR'S HEART NEXT DAY WE STARTED EARLY
CHAPTER XV
WE SHALL DESCEND AT A SLOW RATE AND OUR LUNGS WILL BECOME INURED TO A DENSER ATMOSPHERE
BUT ON THE 29TH OF JUNE THE LAST DAY BUT ONE OF THE MONTH WITH THE CHANGE OF THE MOON CAME A CHANGE OF WEATHER
BUT ON ENTERING THIS STUDY NOW I THOUGHT OF NONE OF ALL THESE WONDERS
WHEN OUR FLASKS ARE EMPTY WHERE SHALL WE FILL THEM AGAIN
THERE WAS PARSLEY SOUP AN OMELETTE OF HAM GARNISHED WITH SPICED SORREL A FILLET OF VEAL WITH COMPOTE OF PRUNES
WHEN YOU RETURN AXEL YOU WILL BE A MAN HIS EQUAL FREE TO SPEAK AND TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND FREE TO THE DEAR GIRL ONLY FINISHED THIS SENTENCE BY BLUSHING
I FEEL SURE YOU ARE BETTER YES I AM INDEED SAID I SITTING UP ON MY COUCH
YET THE COOL MORNING AIR AND THE SCENES ON THE ROAD RAPIDLY CHANGED BY THE SWIFTNESS OF THE TRAIN DREW ME AWAY SOMEWHAT FROM MY SAD REFLECTIONS
IN A WORD A MAN MIGHT LIVE HAPPILY ENOUGH IN THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE IN THE KOENIGSTRASSE IN SPITE OF THE RESTLESS IMPATIENCE OF ITS MASTER FOR ALTHOUGH HE WAS A LITTLE TOO EXCITABLE--HE WAS VERY FOND OF ME
EVERY STEP CONFIRMED ME IN IT AND I WAS REJOICING AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING MY LITTLE GRAEUBEN AGAIN
DOWN BELOW I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL
IT WAS TO BENEFIT HIMSELF NOT OTHERS
THE OTHER WAS READY TO GIVE WHATEVER WAS DEMANDED
NO SOUND COULD REACH US THROUGH WALLS THE THINNEST OF WHICH WERE FIVE MILES THICK
TORCH IN HAND HE TRIED TO GATHER SOME IDEA OF OUR SITUATION FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THE STRATA
THE BLAST OF ASHES SCORIX AND RUBBISH HAD CEASED TO RISE
IN AN HOUR MY NODULES WERE ALL ARRANGED UPON SUCCESSIVE SHELVES
THE RUDDER STANDS MOTIONLESS IN A SLUGGISH WAVELESS SEA
THE DENSE ATMOSPHERE ACTED WITH GREAT FORCE AND IMPELLED US SWIFTLY ON
GIF AKT ATTENTION REPEATED MY UNCLE
THE WIND WAS LASHING IT ON TO THAT SIDE OF SNAEFELL WHERE WE WERE HOLDING ON
UNCLE DO YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE WONDERFULLY BEFRIENDED US HITHERTO YOU THINK SO AXEL NO DOUBT
PRESENTLY THE DUST STORM FELL UPON THE MOUNTAIN WHICH QUIVERED UNDER THE SHOCK
UNCLE I CRIED
COULD NOT FIND YOU
THOUGH AWAKE I FELL INTO A DREAM
SHOULD MARTHA AND I BE VICTIMS OF A POSITION OF THINGS IN WHICH WE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST INTEREST
HIS GAZE EVER DIRECTED UPWARDS WAS LOST IN THE GREY AND MISTY SPACE BEYOND
THE VALKYRIA WAS A SPLENDID SAILER BUT ON A SAILING VESSEL YOU CAN PLACE NO DEPENDENCE
SOMETIMES BY A SPASMODIC AND INVOLUNTARY CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH BUT THEY NEVER SMILED
SHE AND I LABELLED THEM TOGETHER
HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS
I WAS RIGHT IN MY SUPPOSITION
IN A WORD HE WAS A LEARNED MISER
WELL HE CRIED WHERE ARE HIS WORKS HIS WORKS WE HAVE THEM NOT WHAT--NOT IN ICELAND THEY ARE NEITHER IN ICELAND NOR ANYWHERE ELSE WHY IS THAT BECAUSE ARNE SAKNUSSEMM WAS PERSECUTED FOR HERESY AND IN 1573 HIS BOOKS WERE BURNED BY THE HANDS OF THE COMMON HANGMAN VERY GOOD
IT WAS EIGHT IN THE EVENING
I WANTED TO SPEAK TO MY UNCLE BUT THE ROARING OF THE WAVES PREVENTED HIM FROM HEARING EVEN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE
THE PROFESSOR WAS SOON AWARE OF THE PRESENCE HE WAS IN
SUPPER TIME IS COME
I COULD FEEL THE HEAVING OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH SEEMED TO BREATHE LIKE A HUGE WHALE AND PUFF OUT FIRE AND WIND FROM ITS VAST BLOWHOLES
IT IS CAREFULLY MOWN IN THE HAY SEASON
I REMAINED A STEADFAST ADHERENT OF THE OPINIONS OF PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK AND I ENVIED THE STOLID INDIFFERENCE OF HANS WHO WITHOUT GOING INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS WENT ON WITH HIS EYES SHUT WHEREVER HIS DESTINY GUIDED HIM
I AM GOING
CANST THOU WORK I THE GROUND SO FAST
FOLLOW MY FINGER ALONG THE WEST COAST OF ICELAND
TO MY GREAT SURPRISE A HALF-FINISHED RAFT WAS ALREADY LYING ON THE SAND MADE OF A PECULIAR KIND OF WOOD AND A GREAT NUMBER OF PLANKS STRAIGHT AND BENT AND OF FRAMES WERE COVERING THE GROUND ENOUGH ALMOST FOR A LITTLE FLEET
WE ARE GOING UP WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED
LOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH TO DESCRIBE MY DESPAIR WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
THE TREATY CONCLUDED HANS SILENTLY WITHDREW
AS FOR ME WHAT I REMEMBER IS THAT I GOT SEVERE CRAMPS IN MY STOMACH WHICH HARDLY SUITED THE CONSTITUTION OF A HUNGRY GROWING LAD
HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE BESPOKE PERFECT CALMNESS AND SELF-POSSESSION NOT INDOLENCE BUT TRANQUILLITY
A DIM PROCESSION OF MOVING SHADOWS SEEMED SLOWLY UNFOLDING DOWN THE DARKENING WALLS
WE CANNOT STEER
AND THOSE DISTANT BLUE MOUNTAINS IN THE EAST WERE THE MOUNTAINS OF CALABRIA
HE IS STOPPED BY NEITHER SNOW NOR STORM NOR IMPASSABLE ROADS NOR ROCKS GLACIERS OR ANYTHING
AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT CAPE SAKNUSSEMM THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE OF THIS CONFOUNDED COMPASS BEGAN TO POINT SOUTH INSTEAD OF NORTH EVIDENTLY HERE THEN IS THE EXPLANATION OF OUR MISTAKE
WELL IN FACT I DID LOOK BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED
IT IS NOT CONTAGIOUS BUT HEREDITARY AND LEPERS ARE FORBIDDEN TO MARRY
NOTHING ON EARTH COULD STOP HIM
BUT THIS ILLUSION LASTED A VERY SHORT TIME
OUR ROUTE NOW LAY WESTWARD
NO TREES AND SCARCELY ANY VEGETATION
AT MID-DAY WE ARRIVED
PERHAPS WE MAY YET MEET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAURIANS WHICH SCIENCE HAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF A BIT OF BONE OR CARTILAGE
THESE REMEMBRANCES CAME INTO MY MIND AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT SINCE MY UNCLE'S VOICE REALLY REACHED ME THERE COULD BE NO OBSTACLE BETWEEN US
THESE HUMBLE GARDEN PLANTS WITH US WERE TALL TREES IN THE EARLY AGES
WITH A WESTERLY DEVIATION OF NINETEEN DEGREES FORTY-FIVE MINUTES JUST AS ABOVE GROUND
AND TO OUR SORROW WE HAD LITTLE REASON TO EXPECT TO FIND A SPRING IN THESE TRANSITION BEDS
WELL SAID OLD MOLE
MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN
BUT M
BUT FOR THE STRONG ARM OF HANS I SHOULD MORE THAN ONCE HAVE HAD MY HEAD BROKEN AGAINST THE GRANITE ROOF OF OUR BURNING DUNGEON
BUT SUPPOSING IT MIGHT BE A SOLITARY CASE WE BAITED AFRESH AND THREW OUT OUR LINE
AXEL HAVE YOU GOT IT I ANSWERED NOT A WORD AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON
OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NIGHT WERE VERY SIMPLE
THE DANGER IS APPROACHING
THEN THE DISORDERED COMPASS THROWN OUT OF GEAR BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENTS CONFIRMED ME IN A GROWING CONVICTION
TALL PALMS BELONGING TO SPECIES NO LONGER LIVING SPLENDID PALMACITES FIRS YEWS CYPRESS TREES THUJAS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONIFERS WERE LINKED TOGETHER BY A TANGLED NETWORK OF LONG CLIMBING PLANTS
WHO KNOWS WHERE?--INSTEAD OF BURROWING UNDER THE DESERTS OF AFRICA OR PERHAPS THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC
I HAD NO IDEA OF THE SPECTACLE WHICH WAS AWAITING US IN THE PENINSULA OF SNAEFELL WHERE THESE RUINS OF A FIERY NATURE HAVE FORMED A FRIGHTFUL CHAOS
AND I SHOWED MY UNCLE A RUSTY DAGGER WHICH I HAD JUST PICKED UP
I HAVE UNDERTAKEN THIS EXPEDITION
HOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NIGHT-TIME BUT UNDER THE 65TH PARALLEL THERE WAS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THE NOCTURNAL POLAR LIGHT
BUT WHAT WERE THESE CAVITIES COMPARED TO THAT IN WHICH I STOOD WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION WITH ITS SKY OF LUMINOUS VAPOURS ITS BURSTS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT AND A VAST SEA FILLING ITS BED
THERE CAME INCESSANT AND CONTINUOUS EXPLOSIONS
THE HUGE SIGILLARIA FOUND IN OUR COAL MINES
THE WHOLE OF THE NEXT DAY THE GALLERY OPENED BEFORE US ITS ENDLESS ARCADES
THE PROFESSOR MIGHT RETURN AT ANY MOMENT
CHAPTER VIII
THIS IS A DELUSION I THOUGHT
TRANS I WAS DELIGHTED TO LEAVE MY DARK GROTTO
BUT THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO FEAR NOR DID SHE DO THE HONOURS AT ALL TOO GRACEFULLY
AS FOR ME I COULD NOT GET ONE MOMENT'S SLEEP
HAD HE ANY MEANS OF MAKING THIS CALCULATION
THE NEXT DAY THE SKY WAS AGAIN OVERCAST
THEN I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL
THESE TWO WRITINGS ARE NOT BY THE SAME HAND HE SAID
THE NEARER WE APPROACH THE HIGHER MOUNTS THE JET OF WATER
IT WAS A PRECIOUS DOCUMENT FOR A MINERALOGIST
WE ARE NOT IN SAKNUSSEMM'S ROAD AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO GO BACK
AFTER A GOOD WALK I RETURNED TO M
A GLIMPSE OF HOPE HAD RETURNED ALTHOUGH WITHOUT CAUSE
BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT-LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THE NAME OF SAKNUSSEMM AND WE SHOULD AT THIS MOMENT BE IMPRISONED ON A ROCKBOUND IMPASSABLE COAST YES AXEL IT IS PROVIDENTIAL THAT WHILST SUPPOSING WE WERE STEERING SOUTH WE SHOULD HAVE JUST GOT BACK NORTH AT CAPE SAKNUSSEMM
WE COULD DISTINCTLY OBSERVE THE TWO MONSTERS ENGAGED IN DEADLY CONFLICT
BUT ONE CHANCE IN A THOUSAND OR TEN THOUSAND IS STILL A CHANCE
BUT TIME WAS PASSING AWAY
BUT WE HAVE GOT TO THE END OF THAT ENDLESS SEA
JA REPLIED HANS
LET US LOOK ABOUT
TRANS WE MOVED WITH DIFFICULTY ACROSS THESE GRANITE FISSURES AND CHASMS MINGLED WITH SILEX CRYSTALS OF QUARTZ AND ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS WHEN A FIELD NAY MORE THAN A FIELD A VAST PLAIN OF BLEACHED BONES LAY SPREAD BEFORE US
AFTER SOME TIME MY UNCLE APPROACHED ME AND RAISED ME IN HIS ARMS
THERE I DROPPED LIKE A LIFELESS LUMP EXTENDED ON THE LAVA SOIL
WHAT IS DARKNESS TO YOU IS LIGHT TO ME
WE WERE SIMPLY DISINTERESTED TRAVELLERS VISITING ICELAND OUT OF HARMLESS CURIOSITY
I GAZE UPWARD IN THE AIR
OUR FAITHFUL HANS IN SPITE OF OUR ENTREATIES HAD LEFT HAMBURG
DO YOU MEAN TO AFFIRM THAT WE ARE RUNNING UP THE SHAFT OF A VOLCANO I BELIEVE WE ARE SAID THE INDOMITABLE PROFESSOR WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT SELF-POSSESSION
NO HE IS NOT THE MASTER OF OUR LIFE
PERHAPS EVEN WE MAY PURSUE OUR STUDIES IN ITS CRATER I AM VERY SORRY SAID M
WHILE TWO STARS PLUTO AND PROSERPINE ROLLED WITHIN UPON THE CIRCUIT OF THEIR MYSTERIOUS ORBITS
AT A QUARTER PAST THE MOORINGS WERE LOOSED AND THE THROBBING STEAMER PURSUED HER WAY OVER THE DARK WATERS OF THE GREAT BELT
WHAT OTHER MEN CAN BE THIRTY LEAGUES UNDER GROUND I AGAIN BEGAN TO LISTEN
BUT THOUGH AT FIRST I WAS UNBELIEVING I HAD TO YIELD TO THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES
I WAS A PREY TO DELIRIUM
MY UNCLE FALLS FULL LENGTH
SEE I SAID POINTING TO THE VARIED SERIES OF SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONES AND THE FIRST INDICATION OF SLATE
WHY THERE IS NOTHING BUT A FEW TATTERED BOOKS UPON ALMOST DESERTED SHELVES INDEED REPLIED M
IT IS NOT EVEN OF THE IRON AGE
A MAN SHUT UP BETWEEN FOUR WALLS SOON LOSES THE POWER TO ASSOCIATE WORDS AND IDEAS TOGETHER
I WISHED TO LEAVE HIM COOL AND SELF-POSSESSED
BUT HERE THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
MY UNCLE WANTED TO PAY THE HUNTER A PORTION IN ADVANCE BUT HE REFUSED WITH ONE WORD
I CONSULTED THE COMPASS
MY UNCLE TOOK THE PIECE OF MEAT AND THE FEW BISCUITS WHICH HAD ESCAPED FROM THE GENERAL DESTRUCTION
TOO MUCH IF THE INTERNAL HEAT WAS TO RISE SO HIGH FOR IN THIS CASE WE SHOULD BE BAKED NOT ENOUGH TO MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE OF SPRINGS OR ANY MATTER IN A STATE OF FUSION
BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN
HOWEVER WE HAD LEFT BEHIND US THE LUMINOUS FOREST DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT OVERWHELMED AND STRUCK DOWN WITH A TERROR WHICH AMOUNTED TO STUPEFACTION
BESIDES WE SHALL SEE FOR OURSELVES AND LIKE ARNE SAKNUSSEMM WE SHALL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO HOLD AS TRUTH CONCERNING THIS GRAND QUESTION VERY WELL WE SHALL SEE I REPLIED FEELING MYSELF CARRIED OFF BY HIS CONTAGIOUS ENTHUSIASM
BUT AFTER TOILING UP A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STEPS THE FRESH AIR CAME TO SALUTE MY FACE AND WE WERE ON THE LEADS OF THE TOWER
RAIN MINGLED WITH SNOW WAS FALLING ALL DAY LONG
IT WAS TRANSLATED INTO ALL CIVILISED LANGUAGES
LET THE WIND CATCH US IF IT WILL
WE HAD ABOVE US A LEAGUE AND A HALF OF TERRESTRIAL CRUST
BUT I HAVE HAD A STRANGE HALLUCINATION
THE BUILDING WAS CONSTRUCTED OF ROUGHLY SQUARED TIMBERS WITH ROOMS ON BOTH SIDES FOUR IN NUMBER ALL OPENING OUT INTO THE ONE PASSAGE
BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
IS THE ERUPTION CHECKED I ASKED
I RECEIVED NOT LONG AGO A MAP FROM MY FRIEND AUGUSTUS PETERMANN AT LIEPZIG
BUT STILL NO FEARS OF FALLING ROCKS OR RUSHING FLOODS COULD STAY US NOW
I LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PLAIN
DURING THE FORTNIGHT FOLLOWING OUR LAST CONVERSATION NO INCIDENT OCCURRED WORTHY OF BEING RECORDED
THE FUSE WAS CALCULATED TO BURN TEN MINUTES BEFORE SETTING FIRE TO THE MINE
BUT WELL HERE WAS SOMETHING THAT BAFFLED US COMPLETELY
WHAT IS THE MATTER MY UNCLE BREAKS IN
I WAS ONLY BEWILDERED FOR A TIME NOT LOST
WAS HE ON A JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY
ALREADY I WAS FEELING THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FAINT AND WAS HOPING FOR COMPLETE ANNIHILATION WHEN A LOUD NOISE REACHED ME
IT WAS AUDIBLY INCREASING
BUT AXEL ARE YOU NOT MISTAKEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO SPEAK DECIDEDLY UNCLE FOR ALL THESE ROCKS ARE SO VERY MUCH ALIKE
IT IS FIR PINE OR BIRCH AND OTHER NORTHERN CONIFERAE MINERALISED BY THE ACTION OF THE SEA
IN OTHER PLACES THIS MAGNIFICENCE GAVE WAY TO NARROW CHANNELS BETWEEN LOW STRUCTURES WHICH LOOKED LIKE BEAVER'S HUTS AND WE HAD TO CREEP ALONG THROUGH EXTREMELY NARROW PASSAGES
CAN WE TELL THAT NO
THAT MAN WANTED ONCE MORE TO MARK THE WAY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH
I HAD HEARD OF THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY IN IRELAND AND FINGAL'S CAVE IN STAFFA ONE OF THE HEBRIDES
HANS AND I WATCHED YOU BY TURNS AND WE HAVE NOTICED YOU WERE EVIDENTLY RECOVERING INDEED I DO FEEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER AND I WILL GIVE YOU A PROOF OF THAT PRESENTLY IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE MY BREAKFAST YOU SHALL EAT LAD
INDEED THE CASTLE IS MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
IT WAS NO LONGER A FOSSIL BEING LIKE HIM WHOSE DRIED REMAINS WE HAD EASILY LIFTED UP IN THE FIELD OF BONES
FOUR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN THIS RIDICULOUS SENTENCE
IT IS HIGHLY IMPREGNATED WITH IRON
STRUVE THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR
I AM THE ONLY LIVING THING IN THE WORLD
DESSERT OVER HE BECKONED ME INTO HIS STUDY
THIS IS GNEISS
IF THEY ARE AS INTELLIGENT AS THEY ARE SAID TO BE I THOUGHT THEY WON'T TRY IT
ABOUT EIGHT IN THE EVENING HE SIGNALLED TO STOP
WHAT THE BORING MACHINE AN INSENSIBLE INERT INSTRUMENT WAS UNABLE TO BRING TO THE SURFACE OF THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBE WE WERE ABLE TO PERUSE WITH OUR OWN EYES AND HANDLE WITH OUR OWN HANDS
BESIDES WHEN THE INCLINE BECAME MORE GENTLE IT WOULD OF COURSE RESUME ITS PEACEABLE COURSE
UNCONSCIOUSLY I FANNED MYSELF WITH THE BIT OF PAPER THE BACK AND FRONT OF WHICH SUCCESSIVELY CAME BEFORE MY EYES
I FEARED THIS AND SAID TO THE PROFESSOR
A CHRONOMETER MADE BY BOISSONNAS JUN OF GENEVA ACCURATELY SET TO THE MERIDIAN OF HAMBURG
AS FAST AS WE DESCENDED THE SUCCESSION OF BEDS FORMING THE PRIMITIVE FOUNDATION CAME OUT WITH INCREASING DISTINCTNESS
THEREFORE HUMPHRY DAVY WAS RIGHT AND I AM NOT WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIM
WE HAD TO PROCEED ON OUR WAY
I PLACED MY LIPS CLOSE TO THE WALL SAYING
THE WEIGHT OF IT SEEMED TO BE CRUSHING DOWN UPON MY SHOULDERS
THE RAFT FLIES AT A RATE THAT I CANNOT RECKON BUT NOT SO FAST AS THE FOAMING CLOUDS OF SPRAY WHICH IT DASHES FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN ITS HEADLONG SPEED
IT STOPS OPEN ANYWHERE
NO HUMAN BEING MAY WITH SAFETY DARE THE ANGER OF THESE MONSTROUS BEASTS NO HUMAN CREATURE REPLIED MY UNCLE IN A LOWER VOICE
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
WHAT
IT IS A MOUNTAIN FIVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE IN THE WORLD IF ITS CRATER LEADS DOWN TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE I SAID SHRUGGING MY SHOULDERS AND DISGUSTED AT SUCH A RIDICULOUS SUPPOSITION
DOES HE MEAN THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO ANIMALS HE IS RIGHT SAID MY UNCLE WHOSE GLASS HAS NEVER LEFT HIS EYE
AT LEAST I WOULD HAVE IT TO BE SPITZBERGEN AND I WAS IN NO HUMOUR TO GIVE UP THIS NOTION
FOR IT WAS A TERRIBLE FACT THAT IT NO LONGER RAN AT MY SIDE
AND BESIDES IF HE WANTS IT HE SHALL HAVE MY HORSE
BUT I KEPT MY DIALECTIC BATTERY IN RESERVE FOR A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY AND I INTERESTED MYSELF IN THE PROSPECT OF MY DINNER WHICH WAS NOT YET FORTHCOMING
AFTER THREE HOURS WALK OVER SUCH EASY GROUND IT MAY BE EASY BUT IT IS TIRING ALL THE SAME WHAT WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT KEEP GOING DOWN GOING UP IF YOU PLEASE GOING UP SAID MY UNCLE WITH A SHRUG
WITH THIS STREAM FOR OUR GUIDE THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT SUCCEED IN OUR UNDERTAKING AH MY BOY
WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME
WE MUST GET USED TO IT BUT COME I TELL YOU
NO NOTHING UNTIL YOU PROCEED TO READ FROM THE END TO THE BEGINNING I HAD NOT FINISHED MY SENTENCE WHEN THE PROFESSOR BROKE OUT INTO A CRY NAY A ROAR
BUT ON OUR GRACEFULLY DECLINING SHE INSISTED NO LONGER AND I WAS ABLE AT LAST TO CURL MYSELF UP IN MY MOSSY BED
YOUR BOXES ARE NOT PACKED AND MY PAPERS ARE NOT ARRANGED
WHEN I WAS ABLE TO REOPEN THEM I STOOD MORE STUPEFIED EVEN THAN SURPRISED
YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
LOOK CRIED THE PROFESSOR
WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
I SAW A BOTTOMLESS PIT OPEN ON THE SHORE
MY UNCLE LOST NO TIME IN OBEYING THE FRIENDLY CALL NOR WAS I SLACK IN FOLLOWING
THEN I SAW HIM TAKE THE FLASK THAT WAS HANGING AT HIS SIDE
BUT THIS SUDDEN FLOOD WAS NOT OF LONG DURATION
HE POINTED OUT THE EASTERN TUNNEL AND WE WERE SOON ALL THREE IN IT
OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM
A SUDDEN LIGHT BURST IN UPON ME
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER WERE THREE CHIMNEYS THROUGH WHICH IN ITS ERUPTIONS SNAEFELL HAD DRIVEN FORTH FIRE AND LAVA FROM ITS CENTRAL FURNACE
FRIDRIKSSEN WITH WHOM I FELT THE LIVELIEST SYMPATHY
BUT WHEN HE LEARNT THAT THE DANISH MILE WAS 24,000 FEET LONG HE WAS OBLIGED TO MODIFY HIS CALCULATIONS AND ALLOW SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS FOR THE MARCH
HE SPURRED ON TO THE EDGE
A VIOLENT THUMP MADE THE FURNITURE RATTLE AND SPILT SOME INK AND MY PEN DROPPED FROM BETWEEN MY FINGERS
BUT PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK SEEMED NOT TO NOTICE IT
THEN WE REACHED THE BANKS OF THE ELBE AND AFTER HAVING BID GOOD-BYE TO THE SWAN SAILING GRACEFULLY AMIDST THE WHITE WATER LILIES WE RETURNED TO THE QUAY BY THE STEAMER
TWENTY TIMES WE WERE NEAR CAPSIZING
NOT ICELAND CRIED THE PROFESSOR
THE RESULT OF THE TREATY WAS THAT HANS ENGAGED ON HIS PART TO CONDUCT US TO THE VILLAGE OF STAPI ON THE SOUTH SHORE OF THE SNAEFELL PENINSULA AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE VOLCANO
I LEAPED UP ON THE ROCK
NEDAT REPLIED HANS
AH I CRIED SPRINGING UP
BUT HE SEES ON THE OTHER HAND ENEMIES NOT LESS TERRIBLE
AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME HOURS NO DOUBT EXHAUSTED I FELL LIKE A LIFELESS LUMP AT THE FOOT OF THE WALL AND LOST ALL CONSCIOUSNESS
TO JUDGE BY THE DISTANT APPEARANCE OF THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED TOO STEEP TO ASCEND ON OUR SIDE
IN FACT ONLY HALF CLOTHED WITH RAGGED HAIR AND BEARDS WE WERE A SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING PARTY
WE SHALL SEE
BUT IN ADDITION TO ALL THIS THE ICELANDIC HAS THREE NUMBERS LIKE THE GREEK AND IRREGULAR DECLENSIONS OF NOUNS PROPER LIKE THE LATIN AH SAID I A LITTLE MOVED OUT OF MY INDIFFERENCE
THIS CONCLUSION REVIVED MY SPIRITS AND I RESOLVED TO RESUME MY MARCH WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME
HANS PREPARED SOME FOOD WHICH I COULD NOT TOUCH
1 1 THIS DISTANCE CARRIES THE TRAVELLERS AS FAR AS UNDER THE PYRENEES IF THE LEAGUE MEASURES THREE MILES
NEVER HAD MINERALOGISTS FOUND THEMSELVES IN SO MARVELLOUS A SITUATION TO STUDY NATURE IN SITU
ON THE 15TH OUR PREPARATIONS WERE ALL MADE
BUT NO LIVING CREATURE APPEARED UPON THE BARREN STRAND
BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES
HE HAS LAID A FIRM HOLD UPON A ROPE AND APPEARS TO WATCH WITH GRIM SATISFACTION THIS AWFUL DISPLAY OF ELEMENTAL STRIFE
AND IF I DID NOT OBEY HIS CALL WHO COULD ANSWER FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
THOSE ALCHEMISTS HE RESUMED AVICENNA BACON LULLY PARACELSUS WERE THE REAL AND ONLY SAVANTS OF THEIR TIME
SUCH WERE THE MAGNIFICENT PLANS WHICH STRUGGLED FOR MASTERY WITHIN ME
A FAMOUS FELLOW CRIED MY UNCLE
HE REFUSED TO STOP
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS LOST
BUT THIS WAS MERELY A MISCHIEVOUS REPORT
EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE WERE OBLIGED TO HALT TO TAKE A LITTLE NECESSARY REPOSE AND RESTORE THE ACTION OF OUR LIMBS
BY NIGHTFALL WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HALF OUR JOURNEY AND WE LAY AT KROESOLBT
IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO POINT OUT WHICH OF THESE LEADS TO THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE
THE WANT OF WATER HE SAID IS THE ONLY OBSTACLE IN OUR WAY
HANS RUBBED YOUR WOUNDS WITH SOME OINTMENT OR OTHER OF WHICH THE ICELANDERS KEEP THE SECRET AND THEY HAVE HEALED MARVELLOUSLY
I FORGOT THE PAST I SCORNED THE FUTURE
LOWER DOWN THAN THAT NIGHT CAME
THE STEEPNESS INCREASED BUT THESE STONE STEPS ALLOWED US TO RISE WITH FACILITY AND EVEN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT HAVING RESTED FOR A MOMENT WHILE MY COMPANIONS CONTINUED THEIR ASCENT I PERCEIVED THEM ALREADY REDUCED BY DISTANCE TO MICROSCOPIC DIMENSIONS
SEVERAL MINUTES PASS BY WHILE THE FIGHT GOES ON UNDER WATER
20.--WIND N.N.E UNSTEADY AND FITFUL
ITS ROOF SLOPED A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE LIKE THE CAP OVER THE LEFT EAR OF A TUGENDBUND STUDENT
BUT THE ROCKS SUDDENLY ASSUMED A NEW ARRANGEMENT
THE SUPREME HOUR HAD COME
BOLDLY DOWN THE CRATER SUPPER WAS RAPIDLY DEVOURED AND THE LITTLE COMPANY HOUSED THEMSELVES AS BEST THEY COULD
THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED AND THEY WERE NOW DESCENDING THE OUTER SLOPES OF SNAEFELL TO RETURN TO STAPI
THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FISH FOR THEIR SUPPORT
THEN MAKE HASTE DOWN OR WE SHALL LOSE THE TRAIN IT WAS NOW MANIFESTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST DESTINY
ON FRIDAY EVENING THE 10TH OF JULY ACCORDING TO OUR CALCULATIONS WE WERE THIRTY LEAGUES SOUTH-EAST OF REJKIAVIK AND AT A DEPTH OF TWO LEAGUES AND A HALF
THENCE ARISES THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HIGH TEMPERATURE THEN EXISTING WAS DUE TO SOME OTHER SOURCE THAN THE HEAT OF THE SUN
THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH
LET US MINE THE OBSTACLE AND BLOW IT UP OH YES IT IS ONLY A BIT OF ROCK TO BLAST HANS TO WORK CRIED MY UNCLE
THE TEMPERATURE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN 81 DEG
MY UNCLE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THESE WONDERS HAD CEASED TO FEEL SURPRISE
THE DEUCE SAID I TO MYSELF
HOW WELL I KNEW ALL THESE BITS OF SCIENCE
A FLICKERING LIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO GLIMMER ON THE WALL OF OUR DARKSOME PRISON
FOR SINCE THERE WAS NO INDICATION WHATEVER TO GUIDE OUR CHOICE WE WERE OBLIGED TO TRUST TO CHANCE
THE BOUGHS CRACKED AND THE LEAVES TORN AWAY BY CARTLOADS WENT DOWN THE CAVERNOUS THROATS OF THE VAST BRUTES
EAT DID YOU SAY YES AT ONCE THE PROFESSOR ADDED A FEW WORDS IN DANISH BUT HANS SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
MY VOICE WAS LOST IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVERNOUS ECHOES WHICH ALONE REPLIED TO MY CALL
BUT COULD NOT RESTRAIN A TEAR IN TOUCHING MY CHEEK WITH HER GENTLE LIPS
AND I NEVER HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN
WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN
ON THE 9TH OF SEPTEMBER IN THE EVENING WE ARRIVED AT HAMBURG
FORTRAEFFLIG SAID HANS DRINKING IN HIS TURN
HE WAS READY TO START AT A GIVEN SIGNAL OR TO STAY IF HIS MASTER SO WILLED IT
YOUR REASONING HAS IN IT NEITHER SENSE NOR ENERGY THEN DON'T YOU DESPAIR I CRIED IRRITABLY
NOW LET US MARCH
BUT AT LAST A NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS WAS HEARD IN THE DARK ABYSS
THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED REMAINING FEET TOOK US FIVE HOURS TO CLEAR
PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN I THOUGHT AND YET HE PUSHED ON WITH I SUPPOSE HIS EYES RESOLUTELY SHUT
AERONAUTS FIND THE WANT OF AIR AS THEY RISE TO HIGH ELEVATIONS BUT WE SHALL PERHAPS HAVE TOO MUCH
OLAFSEN AND POVELSEN PURSUED BY ORDER OF THE KING THE RESEARCHES OF TROIL THE SCIENTIFIC MISSION OF MM
AFTER SAID THE PROFESSOR FOR MY EDIFICATION
TO-MORROW SAID THE PROFESSOR
A VERY WISE PRECAUTION IN ITSELF BUT AS THINGS TURNED OUT QUITE USELESS
WAS THERE ANY CHANCE OF ESCAPING FROM THE FURY OF THIS IMPETUOUS TORRENT AND OF RETURNING TO THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE
IT BECAME BOGGY AND LESS FAVOURABLE TO PROGRESS
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CONE THERE WERE GLACIERS
THERE WAS NOTHING VAIN IN THESE FANCIES
SHE DELIGHTED ME AND YET I WAS ANGRY WITH HER
I WALKED ON WITHOUT HOPE BUT WITHOUT INDECISION LIKE A MAN WHO HAS MADE UP HIS MIND
HAD THE COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED IT
BONES OF EXTINCT ANIMALS I HAD RUSHED UPON THESE REMAINS FORMED OF INDESTRUCTIBLE PHOSPHATES OF LIME AND WITHOUT HESITATION I NAMED THESE MONSTROUS BONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED ABOUT LIKE DECAYED TRUNKS OF TREES
IT IS A HALT REPLIED MY UNCLE
I RESISTED PAIN AND TORTURE THAT I MIGHT NOT STOP MY UNCLE WHICH WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO DESPAIR FOR THE DAY WAS DRAWING NEAR TO ITS END AND IT WAS HIS LAST
THE GLOBE HAS BURST AND WE ARE DELUGED WITH TONGUES OF FIRE
HIS RED EYES HIS PALE COMPLEXION HIS HAIR TANGLED BETWEEN HIS FEVERISH FINGERS THE RED SPOTS ON HIS CHEEKS REVEALED HIS DESPERATE STRUGGLE WITH IMPOSSIBILITIES AND THE WEARINESS OF SPIRIT THE MENTAL WRESTLINGS HE MUST HAVE UNDERGONE ALL THROUGH THAT UNHAPPY NIGHT
WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT WE HAD GONE FIFTY LEAGUES HORIZONTALLY I COULD NOT REPRESS AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT AT THE THOUGHT THAT WE HAD NOW LONG LEFT ICELAND BEHIND US
19 KOENIGSTRASSE ONE OF THE OLDEST STREETS IN THE OLDEST PORTION OF THE CITY OF HAMBURG
NOT FAR DISTANT WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW-HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST
I COMMUNICATED MY FEARS TO HIM AND DREW BACK A STEP TO GIVE HIM ROOM FOR THE EXPLOSION WHICH I KNEW MUST FOLLOW
MAST AND SAIL FLEW UP IN AN INSTANT TOGETHER AND I SAW THEM CARRIED UP TO PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT RESEMBLING IN APPEARANCE A PTERODACTYLE ONE OF THOSE STRONG BIRDS OF THE INFANT WORLD
MY UNCLE WAS RIGHT UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT
THEREFORE THIS IS IN A SOUTHERN LANGUAGE THESE WERE VERY FAIR CONCLUSIONS I THOUGHT
UNCLE LIEDENBROCK I CRIED LIFTING UP MY VOICE
AT NEWCASTLE ARE THERE NOT COAL MINES EXTENDING FAR UNDER THE SEA IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THE PROFESSOR TO CALL THIS SO SIMPLE BUT I COULD NOT FEEL QUITE EASY AT THE THOUGHT THAT THE BOUNDLESS OCEAN WAS ROLLING OVER MY HEAD
AS FOR ITS HEIGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL LEAGUES
DURING THE SHORT HALTS WE WERE STIFLED WITH THE HEAT
PRAY GO ON WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE I WISH TO ASK WHAT ARE THIS JOKUL THIS SNEFFELS AND THIS SCARTARIS NAMES WHICH I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE NOTHING EASIER
HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL
I FELT FEARFULLY DISAPPOINTED AND I WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT THE OBSTACLE WAS FINAL
PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT
THIS MEAL WILL BE OUR LAST PERHAPS
WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
ALL THE THEORIES OF SCIENCE DEMONSTRATE SUCH A FEAT TO BE IMPRACTICABLE THE THEORIES SAY THAT DO THEY REPLIED THE PROFESSOR IN THE TONE OF A MEEK DISCIPLE
AND PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK MUST HAVE KNOWN FOR HE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE QUITE A POLYGLOT
CAPITAL FELLOW
I TOUCHED THE WALL AND DREW BACK MY HAND BLEEDING
I WILL EVEN ALLOW THAT THE DOCUMENT BEARS EVERY MARK AND EVIDENCE OF AUTHENTICITY
VERY WELL IT'S ALL RIGHT CRIED MY UNCLE NOW AT ANY RATE WE SHALL KNOW WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
WHERE ARE WE ASKED MY UNCLE IRASCIBLY AS IF HE FELT MUCH INJURED BY BEING LANDED UPON THE EARTH AGAIN
BUT IF ALL OCEANS ARE PROPERLY SPEAKING BUT LAKES SINCE THEY ARE ENCOMPASSED BY LAND OF COURSE THIS INTERNAL SEA WILL BE SURROUNDED BY A COAST OF GRANITE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES WE SHALL FIND FRESH PASSAGES OPENING HOW LONG DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS SEA TO BE THIRTY OR FORTY LEAGUES
LOOK AT THOSE QUAKING WALLS
BUT IF THERE HAVE BEEN CREATURES NOW EXTINCT IN THESE UNDERGROUND REGIONS WHY MAY NOT SOME OF THOSE MONSTERS BE NOW ROAMING THROUGH THESE GLOOMY FORESTS OR HIDDEN BEHIND THE STEEP CRAGS AND AS THIS UNPLEASANT NOTION GOT HOLD OF ME I SURVEYED WITH ANXIOUS SCRUTINY THE OPEN SPACES BEFORE ME
BUT NEVER I THINK WERE SUCH SEAWEEDS AS THOSE WHICH WE SAW FLOATING IN IMMENSE WAVING LINES UPON THE SEA OF LIEDENBROCK
PASSING MY EAR OVER THE WALL FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER I FOUND THE POINT WHERE THE VOICES SEEMED TO BE BEST HEARD
WERE WE REALLY CROSSING THE LAYERS OF ROCK WHICH OVERLIE THE GRANITE FOUNDATION
PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE
I WAS ASKING MYSELF THESE UNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS WHEN THE PROFESSOR ENTERED
AND HERE MY UNCLE PAID HANS HIS WEEKLY WAGES AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE NEXT DAY SUNDAY SHOULD BE A DAY OF REST
THE LUCKIEST HAD ONLY TWO URCHINS UPON THEIR KNEES
HE STOOD WITH ARMS CROSSED PERFECTLY UNMOVED BY MY UNCLE'S INCESSANT GESTICULATIONS
AND WHEN YOU COME BACK I WILL BE YOUR WIFE I PRESSED HER IN MY ARMS AND TOOK MY PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE
LIEDENBROCK SO SOON CRIED POOR MARTHA IN GREAT ALARM HALF OPENING THE DINING-ROOM DOOR
LOOK THERE AND WONDER IMPIOUS YOUNG MAN AND ADMIRE THESE LETTERS THE INVENTION OF THE SCANDINAVIAN GOD WELL WELL
WE WERE IMPRISONED IN THE SHAFT OR CHIMNEY OF SOME VOLCANO
AND SUPPOSE HE CALLED ME
I DARED MAKE NO ANSWER
HE LOVED NOTHING BETTER THAN A VERTICAL PATH
BUT THEN CHAPTER XXXVI
DER HUPPE UP THERE AND SO IT WAS
BUT HE MIGHT SEE US
I KNEW VERY WELL THAT IF HE SUCCEEDED IN SETTING DOWN THESE LETTERS IN EVERY POSSIBLE RELATIVE POSITION THE SENTENCE WOULD COME OUT
WHY SHOULD NOT SO FIRMLY CONVINCED A MAN AS MY UNCLE FURNISHED WITH SO INDUSTRIOUS A GUIDE AS HANS AND ACCOMPANIED BY SO DETERMINED A NEPHEW AS MYSELF GO ON TO FINAL SUCCESS
HOW LONG THAT STATE OF INSENSIBILITY HAD LASTED I CANNOT SAY
THE BAGGAGE HORSES FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT GIVING ANY TROUBLE
I PICKED UP A PERFECTLY FORMED SHELL WHICH HAD BELONGED TO AN ANIMAL NOT UNLIKE THE WOODLOUSE
I RUSHED TO THE GLASS
HE HUNG HIS HEAD DOWN
I WILL CARRY IT OUT TO THE END AND I WILL NOT RETURN
FOR MY PART I CANNOT AGREE WITH HIS THEORY OF GRADUAL COOLING
THE GLISTENING BLUISH RAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT HERE AND THERE REFLECTED BY THE DANCING DROPS OF SPRAY SHOT OUT LITTLE SHEAVES OF LIGHT FROM THE TRACK WE LEFT IN OUR REAR
A MILE FARTHER WE HAD TO BOW OUR HEADS UNDER CORNICED ELLIPTIC ARCHES IN THE ROMANESQUE STYLE
ANXIOUS QUERIES AROSE TO MY LIPS
WE THEN SAT DOWN UPON A FRAGMENT OF ROCK AND WE TALKED AS WE ATE AND DRANK FROM THE STREAM
HANS ACCEPTED THE ENTERPRISE WITH SUCH CALMNESS SUCH INDIFFERENCE SUCH PERFECT DISREGARD OF ANY POSSIBLE DANGER THAT I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA OF BEING LESS BRAVE THAN HE
BUT MY UNCLE WAS AS FIRM AND STRAIGHT AS HE WAS AT OUR FIRST START
HE HEARD NOT A SOUND NOT EVEN THAT EXCELLENT WOMAN SAYING
PERHAPS ON A SUNDAY HE MADE AMENDS
THE PROFESSOR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND SAID
YES CRIED MY UNCLE ALMOST FRANTIC WITH EXCITEMENT
HERE NATURE HAD DONE HER WORK GEOMETRICALLY WITH SQUARE AND COMPASS AND PLUMMET
AS A GENERAL RULE ONE SAVANT GREETS ANOTHER WITH COOLNESS
DEEP SHADOWS REPOSED UPON THEIR LOWER WREATHS
WE SUPPOSED THEY WERE STANDING THERE TO BID US A KIND FAREWELL
I LISTENED FOR A CALL AND IN THAT DENSE ATMOSPHERE A VOICE COULD REACH VERY FAR
MONDAY JULY 1
THIS MUST HAVE BELONGED TO HANS AND HE HAS LOST IT I SHOOK MY HEAD
A NEW MARE INTERNUM AT FIRST I COULD HARDLY SEE ANYTHING
PLIOCENE MIOCENE EOCENE CRETACEOUS JURASSIC TRIASSIC PERMIAN CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME
THE DEEPLY INDENTED SHORE WAS LINED WITH A BREADTH OF FINE SHINING SAND SOFTLY XXXII
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH GRAEUBEN HE SAID WITH THE RIGHT LOOK FOR A GUARDIAN
THE SAIL WAS SET AND WE WERE SOON AFLOAT
UNCLE LIEDENBROCK I WAITED WITH THE DEEPEST ANXIETY
AND THE SEA NOW CHANGED INTO A TORRENT WAS HURRYING US ALONG INTO IT
WHICH WERE WE TO TAKE
WHENCE COULD THIS NOISE PROCEED
CHAPTER XXVIII
I COMPARED IT TO A FRIENDLY GENIUS GUIDING US UNDERGROUND AND CARESSED WITH MY HAND THE SOFT NAIAD WHOSE COMFORTING VOICE ACCOMPANIED OUR STEPS
AND IT IS THE BEST THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO US UNDER OUR CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST THING
BE CALM AXEL AND REASONABLE
I WAS PREPARED FOR ANY SURPRISE MY IMAGINATION WAS READY FOR ANY ASTONISHMENT HOWEVER ASTOUNDING
THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID
I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO LOOK DOWN THE BOTTOMLESS PIT INTO WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A PLUNGE
IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY
THEREFORE A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE ELASTIC AND EXPLOSIVE FORCES OF THE IMPRISONED GASES WOULD UPHEAVE THIS PONDEROUS COVER AND DRIVE OUT FOR THEMSELVES OPENINGS THROUGH TALL CHIMNEYS
HE SAT IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND PEN IN HAND HE BEGAN WHAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE ALGEBRAIC FORMULA
I KNEW THAT THE LYCOPODON GIGANTEUM ATTAINS ACCORDING TO BULLIARD A CIRCUMFERENCE OF EIGHT OR NINE FEET
PUT DOWN UPON THIS PAPER ANY SENTENCE YOU LIKE ONLY INSTEAD OF ARRANGING THE LETTERS IN THE USUAL WAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER PLACE THEM IN SUCCESSION IN VERTICAL COLUMNS SO AS TO GROUP THEM TOGETHER IN FIVE OR SIX VERTICAL LINES I CAUGHT HIS MEANING AND IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED THE FOLLOWING LITERARY WONDER
COME AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PROMONTORY WHICH FORMED THE LITTLE NATURAL HARBOUR I PERCEIVED HANS AT WORK
AXEL WE ARE ON THE WAY TOWARDS THE GRAND DISCOVERY
THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
FAHR WAS SCARCELY 15 DEG
AT LAST THE CLEVER LITTLE PONY WITH A BEND OF HIS KNEES STARTED FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING UPON TWO BOULDERS ON THE SHORE JUST LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
HE WAS A WELL OF SCIENCE AND THE PULLEYS WORKED UNEASILY WHEN YOU WANTED TO DRAW ANYTHING OUT OF IT
SCIENCE IS EMINENTLY PERFECTIBLE
MY HEAD IS STILL STUPEFIED WITH THE VIVID REALITY OF MY DREAM
WE HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED YARDS WHEN THE PROFESSOR MOVING HIS LANTERN ALONG THE WALLS CRIED
NOT OF THE BOOK INSIDE WHICH WE HAVE DISCOVERED IT GRANTED
WONDERFUL MAGNIFICENT SPLENDID CRIED MY UNCLE
MY UNCLE WAS CARRYING ONE OF RUHMKORFF'S LAMPS AND I THE OTHER
THE GREAT EXPLOSION AND THE RUSH DOWN BELOW THE NEXT DAY THURSDAY AUGUST 27 IS A WELL-REMEMBERED DATE IN OUR SUBTERRANEAN JOURNEY
THIS WORD PRODUCED A REPULSIVE EFFECT
WEATHER FINE
WOULD SHE NOT BE AFRAID TO JOIN IT HERSELF
BY DILIGENT SEARCH HE HAD FOUND A FLASK OF HOLLANDS
I WILL DESTROY IT THERE WAS A LITTLE FIRE LEFT ON THE HEARTH
AND I MYSELF AM FLOATING WITH WILD CAPRICE IN THE MIDST OF THIS NEBULOUS MASS OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES THE VOLUME OF THE EARTH INTO WHICH IT WILL ONE DAY BE CONDENSED AND CARRIED FORWARD AMONGST THE PLANETARY BODIES
AND I REPEATED TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN I SOUGHT TO GROUP THE LETTERS SO AS TO FORM WORDS
A GUIDE FOUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH IN THE EVENING I TOOK A SHORT WALK ON THE BEACH AND RETURNED AT NIGHT TO MY PLANK-BED WHERE I SLEPT SOUNDLY ALL NIGHT
THE LIGHTNING FLASHES WITH INTENSE BRILLIANCY AND NEVER SEEMS TO CEASE FOR A MOMENT
BUT I SAW THAT THE FORMER WAS STRUGGLING PAINFULLY AGAINST EXCESSIVE FATIGUE AND THE TORTURES OF THIRST
WE WERE ON BOARD AND OWNERS FOR THE TIME OF TWO BERTHS ONE OVER THE OTHER IN THE ONLY SALOON CABIN ON BOARD
YOU MUST TAKE A LESSON IN ABYSSES I OPENED MY EYES
BUT WE ARE GOING UP UP HIGHER STILL
WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS HOW INCOMPREHENSIBLE ARE YOUR FEMININE HEARTS
FRIDAY AUGUST 14_.--WIND STEADY N.W
EVERY MOMENT I SEEM TO SEE ONE OR OTHER OF THEM
CRY THALATTA
A TERRIBLE CRY OF ANGUISH BURST FROM ME
IF THIS WERE THE CASE WE SHOULD HAVE TO RELEASE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
BUT LET US GO BACK TO OUR CALCULATION
I EVEN RESOLVED TO PUT A GOOD FACE UPON IT
WONDERS OF THE DEEP ON THE 13TH OF AUGUST WE AWOKE EARLY
MY UNCLE WANTED TO EMPLOY STRONGER MEASURES AND I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN DISSUADING HIM
AFTER THEIR MEAL MY TWO COMPANIONS LAID THEMSELVES DOWN UPON THEIR RUGS AND FOUND IN SLEEP A SOLACE FOR THEIR FATIGUE
WE HAD COME OUT OF THE CRATER HALF NAKED AND THE RADIANT ORB TO WHICH WE HAD BEEN STRANGERS FOR TWO MONTHS WAS LAVISHING UPON US OUT OF HIS BLAZING SPLENDOURS MORE OF HIS LIGHT AND HEAT THAN WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE WITH COMFORT
WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO-MORROW HE SAID
I HAD NO MEANS NOW OF TAKING ACCOUNT OF TIME
SOMETIMES WE PASSED A SERIES OF ARCHES SUCCEEDING EACH OTHER LIKE THE MAJESTIC ARCADES OF A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL
OFTEN THE SUNKEN ROCKS JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE OBLIGED US TO DEVIATE FROM OUR STRAIGHT COURSE
THE LAST TUFTS OF GRASS HAD DISAPPEARED FROM BENEATH OUR FEET
GOD DAG SAID THE BLACKSMITH IN GOOD DANISH
YET THESE SHOCKS WERE NOT VERY FREQUENT FROM WHICH I CONCLUDED THAT THE GULLY WAS WIDENING
THE CLEAR OPEN WEATHER GAVE US A GOOD VIEW OF MYRDALS JOKUL WHICH OVERHANGS IT
TO THIS PERIOD BELONG THE FELSPAR SYENITES AND PORPHYRIES
AND EVERY NEW THEORY IS SOON ROUTED BY A NEWER
BUT HE MAY SPEAK AGAIN
YET HE WAS NOT A GENERAL BUT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND M
FOR SEVERAL DAYS STEEPER INCLINES SOME EVEN FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THE PERPENDICULAR BROUGHT US DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE MASS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
178 DEG
SOON I WAS CRAWLING ON MY KNEES THEN CREEPING ON MY STOMACH
PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY THE NEXT MORNING I AWOKE FEELING PERFECTLY WELL
YOU MUST BE ON BOARD ON TUESDAY AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING SAID CAPTAIN BJARNE AFTER HAVING POCKETED MORE DOLLARS THAN WERE HIS DUE
MANY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE RETURN OF SAKNUSSEMM TO THE SURFACE AND THE FALL OF THIS HUGE FRAGMENT
I COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIS PERSISTENCY AS WELL AS THE HUNTER'S WHO TREATED OUR EXPEDITION LIKE A MERE PROMENADE
TR 2 AS SIR HUMPHRY DAVY DIED IN 1829 THE TRANSLATOR MUST BE PARDONED FOR POINTING OUT HERE AN ANACHRONISM UNLESS WE ARE TO ASSUME THAT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR'S CELEBRITY DAWNED IN HIS EARLIEST YEARS
THALATTA
THALATTA
THALATTA
THE SUN POURED A FLOOD OF LIGHT DOWN THE CRATER
AT THIS MOMENT I HEARD THE VOICE OF HANS
THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME
AT THAT MOMENT IF HE DID NOT SHARE OUR NATURAL EMOTION AT LEAST HIS COUNTENANCE EXPANDED IN A MANNER VERY UNUSUAL WITH HIM AND WHILE WITH THE ENDS OF HIS FINGERS HE LIGHTLY PRESSED OUR HANDS I BELIEVE HE SMILED
IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OUR NIMBLE HEELS HAD CARRIED US BEYOND THE REACH OF THIS HORRIBLE MONSTER
HOW ARE WE TO EXPLAIN THAT FACT MY OPINION IS I REPLIED DISDAINFULLY THAT IT IS BEST NOT TO EXPLAIN IT
FARTHER ON THE EYE DISCERNED THEIR MASSIVE OUTLINE SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE HAZY DISTANT HORIZON
BUT I KNEW ALSO THAT TWENTY LETTERS ALONE COULD FORM TWO QUINTILLIONS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO QUADRILLIONS NINE HUNDRED AND TWO TRILLIONS EIGHT BILLIONS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX MILLIONS SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND COMBINATIONS
AND THE DEPTH TO WHICH WE HAD DESCENDED WAS FOURTEEN TIMES 200 FEET OR 2,800 FEET
I MUST JOIN THEM
SURELY WILL MY LAST NIGHT'S DREAM BE REALISED
THE SEA SEEMS UNABLE TO MOVE IT IN THE LEAST
IT IS NOTHING WORSE THAN A NATURAL PHENOMENON
THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO
YES TO BE SURE I WAS
THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF
MY UNCLE INTERPOSED
DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES
I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE A REAL SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE
SO AT LAST WHEN I COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER I RESOLVED TO LAY THE CASE BEFORE MY UNCLE AS PRUDENTLY AND AS CAUTIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE JUST UNDER THE FORM OF AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE HYPOTHESIS
BUT AT THAT MOMENT MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO AN UNEXPECTED SIGHT
I MADE AS LITTLE USE OF IT AS POSSIBLE PERFORMING WONDERFUL FEATS OF EQUILIBRIUM UPON THE LAVA PROJECTIONS WHICH MY FOOT SEEMED TO CATCH HOLD OF LIKE A HAND
SPEAK FREELY AT THE LATITUDE OF ICELAND WHERE WE NOW ARE THE RADIUS OF THE EARTH THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRE TO THE SURFACE IS ABOUT 1,583 LEAGUES
HE MAINTAINED HIS COURSE INFLEXIBLY
THIS SAKNUSSEMM HE WENT ON WAS A VERY WELL-INFORMED MAN
THIS WAS BECOMING RIDICULOUS
I PANTED FOR BREATH
MY OVERHEATED BRAIN CONJURED UP VISIONS OF WHITE PLAINS OF COOL SNOW WHERE I MIGHT ROLL AND ALLAY MY FEVERISH HEAT
WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
THE IMMENSE MAMMOTH CAVE IN KENTUCKY IS OF GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS SINCE ITS VAULTED ROOF RISES FIVE HUNDRED FEET 1 ABOVE THE LEVEL OF AN UNFATHOMABLE LAKE AND TRAVELLERS HAVE EXPLORED ITS RAMIFICATIONS TO THE EXTENT OF FORTY MILES
THE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY WHEN I RETURNED TO PARTIAL LIFE MY FACE WAS WET WITH TEARS
TR IT IS TRUE THAT THE OLD HOUSE STOOD SLIGHTLY OFF THE PERPENDICULAR AND BULGED OUT A LITTLE TOWARDS THE STREET
THERE THE AERIAL STAIRCASE BEGAN ITS GYRATIONS ONLY GUARDED BY A THIN IRON RAIL AND THE NARROWING STEPS SEEMED TO ASCEND INTO INFINITE SPACE
MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT THE INCREASE OF A DEGREE IS ONLY ATTAINED AT EVERY 125 FEET
LEARNED STRANGERS THINK THEMSELVES HONOURED IN BECOMING MEMBERS OF IT
NOW THERE WERE GOOD ONES AGAINST THE PRACTICABILITY OF SUCH A JOURNEY
THE EXPLOSION HAD CAUSED A KIND OF EARTHQUAKE IN THIS FISSURED AND ABYSMAL REGION
89 DEG
HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF ME AND IN MANY STRAITS HIS ARM FURNISHED ME WITH A POWERFUL SUPPORT
NOT COME YET AND I RUSHED INTO MY REDOUBTABLE MASTER'S STUDY
I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER
SIT THERE HE ADDED HOLDING OUT HIS FIST TOWARDS THE TABLE
THE ANIMALS TO WHICH THEY BELONGED ROAMED ON THE SHORES OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN SEA UNDER THE SHADE OF THOSE ARBORESCENT TREES
SAELLVERTU SAID HANS
HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER
IT IS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED IN A WORK IN WHICH THE ELEMENT OF AMUSEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENTER MORE LARGELY THAN THAT OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION THAT ANY GREAT DEGREE OF ACCURACY SHOULD BE ARRIVED AT
THE WESTMAN ISLETS SEEMED TO RISE OUT OF THE OCEAN LIKE A GROUP OF ROCKS IN A LIQUID PLAIN
WHAT IS THE MATTER AXEL I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU
JUST AS THE MOMENT OF THE SUPREME EXPERIMENT ARRIVED THE PROFESSOR'S EYES FLASHED RIGHT THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES
AT THIS DINNER MY UNCLE HAD JUST ELICITED IMPORTANT FACTS AMONGST OTHERS THE HISTORY OF SAKNUSSEMM THE REASON OF THE MYSTERIOUS DOCUMENT THAT HIS HOST WOULD NOT ACCOMPANY HIM IN HIS EXPEDITION AND THAT THE VERY NEXT DAY A GUIDE WOULD BE WAITING UPON HIM
IT HAS LASTED NOW FIVE MINUTES AND IN A SHORT TIME WE SHALL RESUME OUR JOURNEY TO THE MOUTH OF THE CRATER AS HE SPOKE THE PROFESSOR CONTINUED TO CONSULT HIS CHRONOMETER AND HE WAS AGAIN RIGHT IN HIS PROGNOSTICATIONS
AT THAT MOMENT OUR GOOD HOUSEKEEPER MARTHA OPENED THE STUDY DOOR SAYING
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE TIN-COMMERCIAL STREET I FOUND THE PUBLIC CEMETERY INCLOSED WITH A MUD WALL AND WHERE THERE SEEMED PLENTY OF ROOM
THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY WAS CONSTRUCTED ON THE ANCIENT PATTERN
WE HAD TO HASTEN FORWARD
TO THE SCHISTS SUCCEEDED GNEISS PARTIALLY STRATIFIED REMARKABLE FOR THE PARALLELISM AND REGULARITY OF ITS LAMINA THEN MICA SCHISTS LAID IN LARGE PLATES OR FLAKES REVEALING THEIR LAMELLATED STRUCTURE BY THE SPARKLE OF THE WHITE SHINING MICA
I SCARCELY ATE AND I SWALLOWED DOWN THE FEW DROPS OF WATER RATIONED OUT TO ME
THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
WELL FOLLOW ME I OBEYED LIKE AN AUTOMATON
AND SINCE MY FATE HAS DRIVEN ME ON THIS PART OF THE COAST I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCES HEREAFTER TO BE EXPLAINED WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE
I TOOK UP MY RIFLE
SUDDENLY AFTER A SPACE OF TIME THAT I COULD NOT MEASURE I FELT A SHOCK
THE GREAT GEYSER WEDNESDAY AUGUST 19_.--FORTUNATELY THE WIND BLOWS VIOLENTLY AND HAS ENABLED US TO FLEE FROM THE SCENE OF THE LATE TERRIBLE STRUGGLE
THEY WERE OF SUPERNATURAL DIMENSIONS
MY UNCLE KEPT TIME TO MY EXCLAMATIONS WITH HANDS AND FEET AS WELL AS WITH WORDS
WHAT DOES THAT SAY IT SAYS WE ARE UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE VERY GOOD
SUCH AS IT WAS JUST SUCH AS IT HAD BEEN DICTATED TO ME SO IT MIGHT BE SPELT OUT WITH EASE
FOR HE SOON ANSWERED THUS
I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING
WE LAY THERE OUR BLOOD RUNNING COLD WITH UNSPEAKABLE TERROR
THE ROAD WAS NOW NOT ASCENDING AT LEAST NOT PERCEPTIBLY
RUBBING OUT BEGINNING AGAIN THEN RUBBING OUT AGAIN AND SO ON A HUNDRED TIMES
WE TOOK OUR PLACES AND WITH OUR SAIL SET HANS STEERED US ALONG THE COAST TO CAPE SAKNUSSEMM
THE COLUMN OF WATER THROWN UP TO A HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET FALLS IN RAIN WITH A DEAFENING UPROAR
EVEN THE TEMPEST HAS PUT US ON THE RIGHT WAY
WE WILL SEE WHAT THAT WILL GIVE US
WHY SHOULD NOT SOME OF THE STRANGE BIRDS RESTORED BY THE IMMORTAL CUVIER AGAIN FLAP THEIR SAIL-BROAD VANS IN THIS DENSE AND HEAVY ATMOSPHERE
SOON WE ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF LAND
WHY I HAVE GOT A PRICELESS TREASURE THAT I FOUND HIS MORNING IN RUMMAGING IN OLD HEVELIUS'S SHOP THE JEW MAGNIFICENT I REPLIED WITH A GOOD IMITATION OF ENTHUSIASM
PRESENTLY WE SHALL COME TO THE TRANSITION PERIOD AND THEN WHAT DID THE PROFESSOR MEAN
BUT STILL WE MARCHED ON AND I ALONE WAS FORGETTING THE LENGTH OF THE WAY BY LOSING MYSELF IN THE MIDST OF GEOLOGICAL CONTEMPLATIONS
HIPPOPOTAMUS
WILL THE READERS OF THIS LITTLE BOOK WHO ARE GIFTED WITH THE MEANS OF INDULGING IN THE LUXURY OF EXTENDED BENEFICENCE REMEMBER THE DISTRESS OF THEIR BRETHREN IN THE FAR NORTH WHOM DISTANCE HAS NOT BARRED FROM THE CLAIM OF BEING COUNTED OUR NEIGHBOURS
I COULD REVIVE WITH VIVID REALITY ALL THE INCIDENTS OF OUR VOYAGE ICELAND M
GOOD BYE UNCLE I CRIED
ALONG WITH THIS WE HAD SKYE A SORT OF CLOTTED MILK WITH BISCUITS AND A LIQUID PREPARED FROM JUNIPER BERRIES
BUT OUR LAST MEAL WAS OVER AND IT WAS NOW FIVE IN THE MORNING
WE ARE SAILING RAPIDLY ALONG AND IF I AM NOT OUT IN MY RECKONING WE SHALL SOON LAND AT THESE WORDS I ROSE AND GAZED ROUND UPON THE HORIZON STILL EVERYWHERE BOUNDED BY CLOUDS ALONE
ONE FLASK HALF FULL WAS ALL WE HAD LEFT TO SLAKE THE THIRST OF THREE MEN
GERMANY HAS NOT A FEW PROFESSORS OF THIS SORT
IT WAS DARK DOWN THE TUNNEL BUT I SEEMED TO SEE THE ICELANDER VANISHING FROM OUR SIGHT WITH THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
F DIRECTION E.S.E THIS LAST OBSERVATION APPLIED TO THE DARK GALLERY AND WAS INDICATED BY THE COMPASS
WHERE COULD MY UNCLE BE AT THAT MOMENT
THE TIDE THEN HIGH ALLOWED US TO PASS OVER WITHOUT DELAY AND TO REACH THE HAMLET OF ALFTANES ONE MILE BEYOND
I DID NOT KNOW A WORD OF DANISH YET INSTINCTIVELY I UNDERSTOOD THE WORD HE HAD UTTERED
STILL MY IMAGINATION CARRIED ME AWAY AMONGST THE WONDERFUL SPECULATIONS OF PALAEONTOLOGY
THEREFORE WE FOLLOWED AS HE BID US
HAPPILY AFTER TWO HOURS WALKING A CHARMING COUNTRY LAY OPEN BEFORE US COVERED WITH OLIVE TREES POMEGRANATE TREES AND DELICIOUS VINES ALL OF WHICH SEEMED TO BELONG TO ANYBODY WHO PLEASED TO CLAIM THEM
HAVE YOU COME TO MEET ME
HAVE WE LOST OUR PROVISIONS YES
HANS WAS NONE THE PROUDER
COULD IT LIE UNLESS INDEED THIS IS THE NORTH POLE OH NO IT IS NOT THE POLE
DOWN THEIR SIDES FLOWED NUMBERLESS WATERFALLS WHICH WENT ON THEIR WAY IN BRAWLING BUT PELLUCID STREAMS
DON'T YOU RECOGNISE THE SYMPTOMS OF AN EARTHQUAKE
I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO LOOK DOWN EITHER OF THEM
IMAGINE THE LARGE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY THESE PLANTS WHICH PREFER A WARM MOIST CLIMATE
THAT IS JUST WHERE I WAS IN MY DREAM WHEN MY UNCLE WITH A VEHEMENT THUMP ON THE TABLE DRAGGED ME BACK TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE
HERE ARE PRIMITIVE ROCKS
HE BEGAN TO CIRCLE ROUND THE CONE OF THE CRATER BUT IN A DIAGONAL DIRECTION SO AS TO FACILITATE OUR PROGRESS
THE REPTILES ROSE
FOR A LONG TIME TO COME THE NATIVES OF THAT INTERESTING ISLAND WHO CLEAVE TO THEIR DESERT HOME WITH ALL THAT AMOR PATRIAE WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAN EXPLAINED WILL LOOK AND LOOK NOT IN VAIN FOR THE HELP OF THOSE ON WHOM FALL THE SMILES OF A KINDLIER SUN IN REGIONS NOT TORN BY EARTHQUAKES NOR BLASTED AND RAVAGED BY VOLCANIC FIRES
THAT'S NOT IT CRIED MY UNCLE THERE'S NO SENSE IN IT THEN DARTING OUT LIKE A SHOT BOWLING DOWN STAIRS LIKE AN AVALANCHE HE RUSHED INTO THE KOENIGSTRASSE AND FLED
THE APERTURE WHICH WAS ALMOST ROUND WAS ABOUT FIVE FEET IN DIAMETER
BUT I HAD NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE PROFESSOR'S IMPATIENCE
AND IT IS ON YOUR SHOULDERS WHERE IT OUGHT TO BE WELL I AM AFRAID MY BRAIN IS AFFECTED YOUR MIND AFFECTED YES I FEAR SO
AN ELECTRIC STORM FRIDAY AUGUST 21_.--ON THE MORROW THE MAGNIFICENT GEYSER HAS DISAPPEARED
LET US THEREFORE ASSUME THIS LAST HYPOTHESIS AS THE MOST SUITABLE TO OUR SITUATION AND CALCULATE WELL DO CALCULATE MY BOY NOTHING IS EASIER SAID I PUTTING DOWN FIGURES IN MY NOTE BOOK
I WAS SUFFERING HORRIBLY
I THOUGHT WHAT RICHES ARE HERE BURIED AT AN UNAPPROACHABLE DEPTH IN THE EARTH HIDDEN FOR EVER FROM THE COVETOUS EYES OF THE HUMAN RACE
MY LIFE HAD BECOME AN ENDLESS FALL
HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO COMMENCE THE GRAND EXPEDITION AT ONCE AND TO LEAVE THIS INHOSPITABLE PARSONAGE
AND YET HE DID HIS WORK CLEVERLY
THE MEN LOOKED LIKE ROBUST BUT HEAVY BLOND GERMANS WITH PENSIVE EYES CONSCIOUS OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM THEIR FELLOW CREATURES POOR EXILES RELEGATED TO THIS LAND OF ICE POOR CREATURES WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESQUIMAUX SINCE NATURE HAD CONDEMNED THEM TO LIVE ONLY JUST OUTSIDE THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
I FOUND THE TEMPERATURE AND THE AIR STIFLING
A DOUBT THEN SEIZED UPON ME
AND EACH OF US EXHAUSTED WITH THREE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS FELL INTO A BROKEN AND PAINFUL SLEEP
AND YET I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE APPEARANCE OF THESE QUADRUPEDS IN A GRANITE CAVERN 1 THESE ANIMALS BELONGED TO A LATE GEOLOGICAL PERIOD THE PLIOCENE JUST BEFORE THE GLACIAL EPOCH AND THEREFORE COULD HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE CARBONIFEROUS VEGETATION
NO GENERATION OF MEN DWELLS IN THOSE INFERIOR CAVERNS OF THE GLOBE UNKNOWN TO AND UNCONNECTED WITH THE INHABITANTS OF ITS SURFACE
THE GROTTO WAS AN IMMENSE APARTMENT
I HAD SOON EXPLORED THESE MELANCHOLY WAYS
FORWARD NO I WILL NOT I CRIED
FOR BEVERAGE WE HAD A THIN MILK MIXED WITH WATER CALLED IN THIS COUNTRY BLANDA IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS DIET IS WHOLESOME OR NOT
AT FIVE IN THE MORNING I WAS AWOKE BY THE NEIGHING AND PAWING OF FOUR HORSES UNDER MY WINDOW
SO WE PRESENTED OURSELVES IN THE HUMBLE GUISE OF SHIPWRECKED MARINERS
YET HERE AND THERE WERE A FEW JETS OF STEAM FROM HOT SPRINGS
AND THEN WE WILL START AGAIN I WAS FORGETTING THAT IT WAS NIGHT
ALL THAT I KNOW IS THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER
SEE IT WAS NEVER JAGGED LIKE THIS BY CUTTING MEN'S THROATS
THEN I BEGAN TO LOSE MY HEAD
HANS WAS AT THE HELM
LIKE MYSELF HE HESITATED
BUT HIS HABIT OF SILENCE GAINED UPON HIM DAY BY DAY AND WAS INFECTING US
FOR DON'T I SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AND DON'T I HEAR THE WIND BLOWING AND THE SEA BREAKING ON THE SHORE AH
IT HAD NO ATTRACTION EXCEPT FOR SNUFF WHICH IT SEEMED TO DRAW TO ITSELF IN GREAT QUANTITIES
NOT SO HANS
THE SEA LASHED INTO SUDDEN FURY ROSE UP IN AN ENORMOUS BILLOW ON THE RIDGE OF WHICH THE UNHAPPY RAFT WAS UPLIFTED BODILY IN THE AIR WITH ALL ITS CREW AND CARGO
TO JUDGE BY THE AIR WHICH WAS WHISTLING PAST ME AND MADE A WHIZZING IN MY EARS WE WERE MOVING FASTER THAN THE FASTEST EXPRESS TRAINS
AND METALS FROM IRON TO GOLD METALS WHOSE CURRENT VALUE ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE REPUBLICAN EQUALITY OF SCIENTIFIC SPECIMENS
HANS DRAWS IT IN AND BRINGS OUT A STRUGGLING FISH
IT IS ABSURD TO BELIEVE IT
AND I THEREFORE WENT OFF TO SLEEP WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BEEN FOUR LONG DAYS ALONE IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH
AND MYSELF WALKING LAST WE ENTERED THE GALLERY
MILNE-EDWARDS
AT THE MOMENT OF BECOMING ENGULFED IN THIS DARK GALLERY I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW FOR THE LAST TIME THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THAT VAST TUBE THE SKY OF ICELAND WHICH I WAS NEVER TO BEHOLD AGAIN
THE RAFT MAKES RAPID WAY IN A DIRECT LINE
ONE HOUR TWO HOURS PASS AWAY
WE GOT NO FORWARDER
I WAS THUS ASKING MYSELF QUESTIONS AND MECHANICALLY TAKING BETWEEN MY FINGERS THE SHEET OF PAPER MYSTERIOUSLY DISFIGURED WITH THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE SUCCESSION OF LETTERS I HAD WRITTEN DOWN
IT RUSHES ON FROM THE FARTHEST RECESSES OF THE VAST CAVERN
WHAT I WANT IS TO GET THE LEAST GLIMPSE OF ROCK OR SHORE EVEN IF OUR RAFT SHOULD BE SMASHED INTO SHIVERS THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH WHEN A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN THE SOUTHERN SKY
LET US GET TO THE TOP SAID MY UNCLE
ON ARRIVING AT THE DOOR OF THE RECTOR'S HOUSE WHICH WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS I SAW A MAN SHOEING A HORSE HAMMER IN HAND AND WITH A LEATHERN APRON ON
OH JUST A SECRET WHICH MY UNCLE STAMMERED
WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK
BY MIDNIGHT OUR MINING PREPARATIONS WERE OVER
AND WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEAGUES FROM ICELAND UNDER ENGLAND
1 SIXTY-THREE
THEY WERE OF A DREAMY SEA-BLUE
THE EXPLOSIONS ARE GOING ON STILL AND I DON'T THINK IT WOULD LOOK WELL TO HAVE COME OUT BY AN ERUPTION AND THEN TO GET OUR HEADS BROKEN BY BITS OF FALLING ROCK
LET US GET ALL THE GOOD WE CAN OUT OF THIS EXPEDITION AND DON'T LET US HAGGLE ABOUT THE CHANCES THIS REASONING HAVING SETTLED MY MIND WE GOT OUT OF REJKIAVIK
FOR THE PROJECTIONS IN THE ROCK FORM QUITE A STAIRCASE THE ROPES WERE SO FASTENED BY HANS AS TO GUARD AGAINST ACCIDENT AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED
AY HE ANSWERED LIKE A MAN SUDDENLY WAKING
NATURE HAS ENDOWED IT WITH AN OPTICAL APPARATUS OF EXTREME POWER AND CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE PRESSURE OF THE GREAT VOLUME OF WATER IN THE DEPTHS IT INHABITS
BUT A REMARKABLE FEATURE WAS THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF COLOUR IN ALL THOSE TREES SHRUBS AND PLANTS GROWING WITHOUT THE LIFE-GIVING HEAT AND LIGHT OF THE SUN
WE MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE TO FIND MYSELF CARRIED SUDDENLY INTO THE ARCTIC REGIONS WITH A COLD 30 DEG
FROM CAPE SAKNUSSEMM WE HAD BEEN CARRIED DUE NORTH FOR HUNDREDS OF LEAGUES
WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT AT LAST I CRIED RETURNING TO MYSELF
CHAPTER XLV
I THROW AN EMPTY BOTTLE INTO THE SEA
NOW IS THE TIME FOR DISCUSSING THAT SAME GLORY BEFORE ALL THINGS MY UNCLE RESUMED I ENJOIN YOU TO PRESERVE THE MOST INVIOLABLE SECRECY
SHE SUPPLIED ME WITH SENSIBLE REASONS FOR OUR EXPEDITION
EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE
YOURS MUST LEAD INTO IT FOR IT SEEMS AS IF ALL THE CLEFTS AND FRACTURES OF THE GLOBE RADIATED ROUND THIS VAST CAVERN
I WILL NEVER HAVE IT LAID TO MY DOOR THAT I LED HIM TO HIS DESTRUCTION HAVING FORMED THIS RESOLUTION I FOLDED MY ARMS AND WAITED
TO BE SURE WE HAVE
IT WAS NIGHT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE IN KOENIGSTRASSE
THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY
WHEN MY UNCLE MYSELF THE GUIDE TWO OTHER PASSENGERS AND THE FOUR HORSES TRUSTED OURSELVES TO A SOMEWHAT FRAGILE RAFT
AY THE COMPASS I SAID GREATLY PUZZLED
MY GREATEST CARE WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF MY COMPANIONS
THE SLOPE WAS RATHER STEEP
MY UNCLE SCARCELY COULD RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE AT THE HORIZONTAL ROAD
THE MAYOR OF REJKIAVIK AND DR HYALTALIN THE FIRST MEDICAL MAN OF THE PLACE BEING OF THE PARTY
THE WORTHY CAPTAIN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS ENTHUSIASM TO CHARGE DOUBLE FARES
IT WAS TEN IN THE MORNING
HE LIVES HE CRIED
WATTEN REPLIED THE HUNTSMAN
BECAUSE THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE SUBJECT LIKE THE OCEAN TO THE LUNAR ATTRACTION AND THEREFORE TWICE EVERY DAY THERE WOULD BE INTERNAL TIDES WHICH UPHEAVING THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST WOULD CAUSE PERIODICAL EARTHQUAKES YET IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO THE ACTION OF FIRE I REPLIED AND IT IS QUITE REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE EXTERNAL CRUST COOLED DOWN FIRST WHILST THE HEAT TOOK REFUGE DOWN TO THE CENTRE QUITE A MISTAKE MY UNCLE ANSWERED
ON THE OTHER EXTENDS THE VAST BAY OF FAXA SHUT IN AT THE NORTH BY THE ENORMOUS GLACIER OF THE SNAEFELL AND OF WHICH THE VALKYRIA WAS FOR THE TIME THE ONLY OCCUPANT
AS AN AFFECTIONATE AND ATTENTIVE NEPHEW I CONSIDERED IT MY DUTY TO EAT FOR HIM AS WELL AS FOR MYSELF WHICH I DID CONSCIENTIOUSLY
WE ARE ABOUT TO CLIMB A VERY REMARKABLE MOUNTAIN
BEFORE THE VOLCANOES BROKE OUT IT CONSISTED OF TRAP ROCKS SLOWLY UPRAISED TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BY THE ACTION OF CENTRAL FORCES
A FEW SHAFTS OF BASALT TORN FROM THEIR HOLD BY THE FURY OF TEMPESTS LAY ALONG THE SOIL LIKE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT TEMPLE IN RUINS FOR EVER FRESH AND OVER WHICH CENTURIES PASSED WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE OF AGE UPON THEM
I BELIEVE WE WERE NO LONGER SLIDING BUT FALLING DOWN
SOMETIMES EVEN IT SEEMED TO HAVE A SLIGHT FALL
AT THAT MOMENT OUR HUNTER RETURNED WHO HAD BEEN SEEING HIS HORSES PROVIDED FOR
I ALSO OBSERVED THE FAMOUS DOCUMENT MOST CAREFULLY LAID UP IN A SECRET POCKET IN HIS PORTFOLIO
VERTICAL DESCENT NOW BEGAN OUR REAL JOURNEY
HE WAS RIGHT AS TO THE LANGUAGE
BUT IF THIS NOISE ARISES FROM A FALL A CATARACT IF ALL THIS OCEAN FLOWS AWAY HEADLONG INTO A LOWER BASIN YET IF THAT DEAFENING ROAR IS PRODUCED BY A MASS OF FALLING WATER THE CURRENT MUST NEEDS ACCELERATE AND ITS INCREASING SPEED WILL GIVE ME THE MEASURE OF THE PERIL THAT THREATENS US
I HAVE THEREFORE EXAMINED THE NATIVES I HAVE STUDIED EXTERNAL APPEARANCES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU AXEL THAT THERE WILL BE NO ERUPTION AT THIS POSITIVE AFFIRMATION I STOOD AMAZED AND SPEECHLESS
I ONLY HOPE THOUGHT I THAT THIS SO-CALLED EXTINCT VOLCANO WON'T TAKE A FANCY IN HIS OLD AGE TO BEGIN HIS SPORTS AGAIN
THENCE MY EYE COULD SWEEP EVERY PART OF THE BAY
BUT ON THE WHOLE ITS DIRECTION SEEMED TO BE SOUTH-EASTERLY
THERE WERE NO CLIMATES AS YET AND A TORRID HEAT EQUAL FROM POLE TO EQUATOR WAS SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE
CHAPTER XI
SNAEFELL THEN RECOMMENDING ME BY AN IMPRESSIVE GESTURE TO KEEP SILENCE HE WENT INTO THE BOAT WHICH AWAITED HIM
ON THE ROAD WE CHATTED HAND IN HAND
THERE MUST BE HERE SOME REMARKABLE EXERCISE OF ACOUSTIC LAWS I LISTENED AGAIN AND THIS TIME YES THIS TIME I DID DISTINCTLY HEAR MY NAME PRONOUNCED ACROSS THE WIDE INTERVAL
BETWEEN THE LITTLE LAKE AND THE TOWN THE CHURCH IS BUILT IN THE PROTESTANT STYLE OF CALCINED STONES EXTRACTED OUT OF THE VOLCANOES BY THEIR OWN LABOUR AND AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE
PREFACE THE VOYAGES EXTRAORDINAIRES OF M
IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
IN THE FIRST HALF MILE WE HAD NOT SEEN ONE FARMER STANDING BEFORE HIS CABIN DOOR NOR ONE SHEPHERD TENDING A FLOCK LESS WILD THAN HIMSELF NOTHING BUT A FEW COWS AND SHEEP LEFT TO THEMSELVES
SEE THE BONES SCATTERED ON THE GROUND SO THERE ARE I CRIED
AND WE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN HAULING UP OUR PLUMMET
WAS IT FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
TUESDAY AUGUST 18
WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
THERE IS NO PROOF AT ALL FOR THIS INTERNAL HEAT
WE WERE TO KNOW THEM BEFORE LONG BUT ON CONSULTING OLSEN'S MAP I SAW THAT THEY WOULD BE AVOIDED BY WINDING ALONG THE SEASHORE
A TORTOISE FORTY FEET LONG AND A SERPENT OF THIRTY LIFTING ITS FEARFUL HEAD AND GLEAMING EYES ABOVE THE FLOOD
THIS WAS NO EASY WORK
BUT IT SEEMS MANIFEST TO ME THAT SOME DAY WE SHALL REACH A REGION WHERE THE CENTRAL HEAT ATTAINS ITS HIGHEST LIMITS AND GOES BEYOND A POINT THAT CAN BE REGISTERED BY OUR THERMOMETERS
THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IF IN SUCH A POSITION AS I WAS NOW IN I WAS FOOL ENOUGH TO CLING TO ONE GLIMPSE OF HOPE IT WOULD BE MADNESS AND THAT THE BEST THING I COULD DO WAS TO DESPAIR
HIS COUNTENANCE EXHIBITS NO SURPRISE BUT HIS EYE IS IMMOVABLY STEADY
THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE
THIS WELL OR ABYSS WAS A NARROW CLEFT IN THE MASS OF THE GRANITE CALLED BY GEOLOGISTS A FAULT AND CAUSED BY THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF THE GLOBE OF THE EARTH
AND STONES TOO ENOUGH TO REBUILD ENTIRELY THE HOUSE IN KOENIGSTRASSE EVEN WITH A HANDSOME ADDITIONAL ROOM WHICH WOULD HAVE SUITED ME ADMIRABLY
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS PASSAGE DOES NOT RUN STRAIGHT TO OUR DESTINATION
LET US THEN BE PREPARED TO SEIZE UPON THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGE BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW RECRUIT OUR STRENGTH BY EATING AT THESE WORDS I FIXED A HAGGARD EYE UPON MY UNCLE
I WILL DIVIDE THEM INTO THREE LOTS
WHAT IS THE NEED OF ADDING THAT THE ILLUSTRIOUS OTTO LIEDENBROCK CORRESPONDING MEMBER OF ALL THE SCIENTIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AND MINERALOGICAL SOCIETIES OF ALL THE CIVILISED WORLD WAS NOW HER UNCLE AND MINE
ON THE SAME DAY WITH MUCH STATE HE DEPOSITED IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE CITY THE NOW FAMOUS DOCUMENT OF SAKNUSSEMM AND EXPRESSED HIS REGRET THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM FOLLOWING TO THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EARTH THE TRACK OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER
THE RASH PROFESSOR CARELESS OF LOSING HIS WAY HURRIED ME FORWARD
ITS WALLS BY A GENTLE INCLINE WERE DRAWING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER
I THEN DESIRED TO PIERCE THE DISTANT HAZE AND TO REND ASUNDER THE MYSTERIOUS CURTAIN THAT HUNG ACROSS THE HORIZON
BUT SILENCE REIGNED IN ALL THIS LITTLE WORLD AT THE ARRIVAL OF THE SOUP AND THE NATIONAL TACITURNITY RESUMED ITS EMPIRE EVEN OVER THE CHILDREN
FRIDRIKSSEN'S HOUSE WHERE I FOUND MY UNCLE ALREADY IN HIS HOST'S COMPANY
BUT I KEPT THIS OBJECTION TO MYSELF AND WAITED THE COURSE OF EVENTS
I NODDED MY HEAD
I LOVE YOU WELL MY OWN DEAR GRAEUBEN HALLO CRIED THE PROFESSOR
MICA WAS MORE CLOSELY MINGLED WITH THE FELDSPAR AND QUARTZ TO FORM THE PROPER ROCKY FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH WHICH BEARS WITHOUT DISTORTION OR CRUSHING THE WEIGHT OF THE FOUR TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS
AND JUDGING BY THESE RIDGES OF FOAM YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT THE SEA WILL RISE ABOUT TWELVE FEET THIS IS WONDERFUL I SAID
THERE WERE THOSE WHO ENVIED HIM HIS FAME
IN SEEKING TO PUT OUR CARGO INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER ORDER I FOUND THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARTICLES EMBARKED HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE MOMENT OF THE EXPLOSION WHEN THE SEA BROKE IN UPON US WITH SUCH VIOLENCE
FOR SHORTLY I ESPIED MY LITTLE GRAEUBEN BRAVELY RETURNING WITH HER LIGHT STEP TO HAMBURG
HERE ARE NO GRANITE PEAKS CAPPED WITH SNOW
WHO CAN TELL AH
WHAT HUMAN POWER COULD RESTORE ME TO THE LIGHT OF THE SUN BY RENDING ASUNDER THE HUGE ARCHES OF ROCK WHICH UNITED OVER MY HEAD BUTTRESSING EACH OTHER WITH IMPREGNABLE STRENGTH
IT IS A MANUSCRIPT A RUNIC MANUSCRIPT RUNIC YES
THE WAVES ROLLED WITH A RUSHING DIN UPON THE SHARP-POINTED ROCKS
AHA
AHA
AHA
THE SEA I CRIED
HERE THE SEA CAME TO LAP THE FOOT OF THE STEEP CLIFF LEAVING A PASSAGE NO WIDER THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS
BUT WE MUST BE READY FOR ANYTHING
ON WEDNESDAY THE 15TH WE WERE SEVEN LEAGUES UNDERGROUND AND HAD TRAVELLED FIFTY LEAGUES AWAY FROM SNAEFELL
I WANTED AIR
MILNE-EDWARDS AND DE QUATREFAGES SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE TO THE GEOLOGISTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WHO BELIEVED IN THE CERTAINTY OF THE FACT--MESSRS
THAT LEARNED PHILOSOPHER DID GET TO THE BOTTOM OF SNEFFELS HE HAS SEEN THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS TOUCH THE EDGE OF THE CRATER BEFORE THE KALENDS OF JULY
BUT IT IS LATIN CONFUSED AND IN DISORDER
I THEREFORE WAITED FOR THE PROFESSOR WITH GREAT POMP TO UNFOLD THE MAGNIFICENT BUT HIDDEN LATIN OF THIS MYSTERIOUS PHRASE
THE RAFT OCCASIONALLY SEIZED BY AN EDDY SPUN ROUND AS IT STILL FLEW ALONG
CREATION HAD EVIDENTLY ADVANCED SINCE THE DAY BEFORE
THE WRITHEN SURFACE PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF DISTORTED TWISTED CABLES SOMETIMES STRETCHED IN LENGTH SOMETIMES CONTORTED TOGETHER
HANS MOVED STEADILY ON KEEPING AHEAD OF US AT AN EVEN SMOOTH AND RAPID PACE
THE GENERAL ASPECT WAS WONDERFULLY DULL
THIS ACOUSTIC EFFECT IS EASILY EXPLAINED ON SCIENTIFIC GROUNDS
A MOST VALUABLE COLLECTION THE FAME OF WHICH IS EUROPEAN
PROGNATHISM IS THAT PROJECTION OF THE JAW-BONES WHICH SHARPENS OR LESSONS THIS ANGLE AND WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE NEGRO COUNTENANCE AND IN THE LOWEST SAVAGES
I EMBARKED ON A SMALL STEAMER WHICH PLIES ON THE CANALS AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE TOUCHED THE QUAY OF THE DOCKYARD
AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND--LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ETC
ACCORDING TO EXACT OBSERVATIONS THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE ADVANCES AT THE RATE OF ONE DEGREE 1 4/5 DEG
SOMETIMES HE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER BEHIND THE HUGE BLOCKS THEN A SHRILL WHISTLE WOULD DIRECT US ON OUR WAY TO HIM
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY HAS VENTURED TO POINT OUT AND CORRECT
PERTUBATA SEU INORDINATA AS EUCLID HAS IT XXX
THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS EXTRACTED THE MOST INTERESTING PASSAGES WHICH WERE COMMENTED UPON PICKED TO PIECES DISCUSSED ATTACKED AND DEFENDED WITH EQUAL ENTHUSIASM AND DETERMINATION BOTH BY BELIEVERS AND SCEPTICS
ITS SURFACE IS 14,000 SQUARE MILES AND IT CONTAINS BUT 16,000 INHABITANTS
THE STROMBOLIOTES RECEIVED US KINDLY AS SHIPWRECKED MARINERS
THERE WERE WILD FIERCE PUFFS OF STORMY WIND FROM BELOW RESEMBLING THE BLASTS OF VAST IRON FURNACES BLOWING ALL AT ONE TIME
THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP
HE TOSSED UP HIS ARMS AND SEEMED TO DEFY IT AND TO DECLARE THERE STANDS THE GIANT THAT I SHALL CONQUER AFTER ABOUT FOUR HOURS WALKING THE HORSES STOPPED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AT THE DOOR OF THE PRIEST'S HOUSE AT STAPI
YOU UNDERSTAND
ALL THIS MY UNCLE WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE TO A BIT OF OLD PARCHMENT
WE ARE IN A VAST CHAMBER WITH ENDLESS GALLERIES
IS IT ILLUSION OR FEAR
AND INHABITED TOO TO BE SURE SAID I
INSTINCTIVELY WE GOT BACK TO THE LIEDENBROCK SEA AND I CANNOT SAY INTO WHAT VAGARIES MY MIND WOULD NOT HAVE CARRIED ME BUT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH BROUGHT ME BACK TO PRACTICAL MATTERS
EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR OUR INSTANT DEPARTURE
WE HAVE NO WATER
I AROSE WITH MY ARMS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE ME ATTEMPTING PAINFULLY TO FEEL MY WAY
I REFUSED TO TAKE IN THE GRAVITY OF OUR LOSS
YES YES HE CRIED
I THREW MYSELF WHOLLY INTO THE PLEASURE OF THE TRIP AND ENJOYED THE FEELING OF FREEDOM AND SATISFIED DESIRE
HE SHOOK HIS PITYINGLY AS IF HE WAS DEALING WITH A LUNATIC
FOR DESSERT CRYSTALLISED FRUIT
WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
IT IS NO USE TO TELL OF THE RAGE AND IMPRECATIONS OF MY UNCLE BEFORE THE EMPTY TABLE
BUT I SAID IS THERE NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT THIS EVER-INCREASING PRESSURE WILL BECOME AT LAST VERY PAINFUL TO BEAR NO
I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
THE ICE KING CERTAINLY HELD COURT HERE AND GAVE US ALL NIGHT LONG SAMPLES OF WHAT HE COULD DO
IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
AND WITH THE OTHER HE FORMED AN ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE COIL IN THE LANTERN AND A SUFFICIENTLY BRIGHT LIGHT DISPERSED THE DARKNESS OF THE PASSAGE
AT INTERVALS UNDER THIS NATURAL SHELTER THERE SPREAD OUT VAULTED ENTRANCES IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES INTO WHICH THE WAVES CAME DASHING WITH FOAM AND SPRAY
HERE ARE ENTIRE SKELETONS
ITS MOVEMENTS BECOME FAINTER ITS CONTORTIONS CEASE TO BE SO VIOLENT AND THE LONG SERPENTINE FORM LIES A LIFELESS LOG ON THE LABOURING DEEP
IT PUBLISHES BOOKS WHICH EDUCATE OUR FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN AND DO THE COUNTRY GREAT SERVICE
THE HEAVING WAVES RESEMBLE FIERY VOLCANIC HILLS EACH BELCHING FORTH ITS OWN INTERIOR FLAMES AND EVERY CREST IS PLUMED WITH DANCING FIRE
ON A NEIGHBOURING HILL I PERCEIVED THE NATIONAL SCHOOL WHERE AS I WAS INFORMED LATER BY OUR HOST WERE TAUGHT HEBREW ENGLISH FRENCH AND DANISH FOUR LANGUAGES OF WHICH WITH SHAME I CONFESS IT I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE WORD
BUT WHAT LANGUAGE IS IT HERE I LOOKED FOR A DISPLAY OF LEARNING BUT I MET INSTEAD WITH PROFOUND ANALYSIS
THIS WAS OUR FINAL SURPRISE AFTER ALL THE ASTONISHING EVENTS OF OUR WONDERFUL JOURNEY
HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING AGAIN AMIDST THIS MONOTONOUS SCENE
ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MY UNCLE
AND YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THESE FOSSIL FISHES HAVE NO IDENTITY WITH ANY LIVING SPECIES
GUIDED BY AN INSTINCT PECULIAR TO MOUNTAINEERS HE HAD AS IT WERE FELT THIS TORRENT THROUGH THE ROCK
THE EYE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THE SNOWY RIDGES ENDED AND THE FOAMING WAVES BEGAN
THUS WERE FORMED THOSE IMMENSE COALFIELDS WHICH NEVERTHELESS ARE NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WHICH THREE CENTURIES AT THE PRESENT ACCELERATED RATE OF CONSUMPTION WILL EXHAUST UNLESS THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD WILL DEVISE A REMEDY
CHAPTER XXXI
SPEAK TO ME COURAGE RESUMED MY UNCLE
1 THE SOIL WAS BESIDES THIS SCATTERED WITH STONY FRAGMENTS BOULDERS ROUNDED BY WATER ACTION AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES
WHAT HE CRIED
BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF SNAEFELL AN EXTINCT VOLCANO WE WERE INSIDE ONE IN FULL ACTIVITY
THESE NO DOUBT I THOUGHT WILL NEVER BE DISCOVERED
A NEW REVELATION BURST IN UPON HIM
THE GREAT ARCHITECT HAS BUILT IT OF THE BEST MATERIALS
A STURGEON I CRIED
I WAS OBLIGED TO ACT CHORUS TO HIM WHEN HE ATTACKED THE CAPTAIN OF THE ELLENORA UPON THIS SUBJECT
THE HEAVY COILS OF SMOKE FROM THE ELLENORA'S FUNNEL UNROLLED IN THE SKY THE BRIDGE SHOOK WITH THE QUIVERING OF THE STRUGGLING STEAM
I SHOWED IT TO MY UNCLE
THAT IS TO SAY HE HAD ECONOMICALLY LET THEM LOOSE IN THE FIELDS WHERE THE POOR BEASTS HAD TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE SCANTY MOSS THEY COULD PULL OFF THE ROCKS AND A FEW MEAGRE SEA WEEDS AND THE NEXT DAY THEY WOULD NOT FAIL TO COME OF THEMSELVES AND RESUME THE LABOURS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY
SOON THE SCHOONER ENCOUNTERED THE GREAT ATLANTIC SWELL
THE SOIL TOLD OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE MOUNTAIN WHOSE GRANITE FOUNDATIONS ROSE FROM THE EARTH LIKE THE KNOTTED ROOTS OF SOME HUGE OAK
MM.RNLLS ESREVEL SEECIDE SGTSSMF VNTEIEF NIEDRKE KT,SAMN ATRATES SAODRRN EMTNAEI NVAECT RRILSA ATSAAR NVCRC IEAABS CCRMI EEVTVL FRANTV DT,IAC OSEIBO KEDIII REDACTOR
WHEN LYING ON MY BACK I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW A BRIGHT SPARKLING POINT OF LIGHT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GIGANTIC TUBE 3,000 FEET LONG NOW A VAST TELESCOPE
WE HAVE LEFT THE GRANITE AND THE LAVA
IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES
WERE THEY SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SPECIES OF VEGETABLES KNOWN HITHERTO AND DID THEY CLAIM A PLACE OF THEIR OWN IN THE LACUSTRINE FLORA
CHRISTIENSEN CONSUL AT HAMBURG AND THE PROFESSOR'S FRIEND
I WAS THINKING OF THAT HE REPLIED WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY
THE INSTRUMENTS THE TOOLS OUR GUNS ARE CLASHING AND CLANKING VIOLENTLY IN THEIR COLLISIONS WITH EACH OTHER
IN THAT PLACE THE FIORD WAS AT LEAST THREE ENGLISH MILES WIDE
YOU RESERVED THE CONTEMPLATION OF THESE WONDERS FOR OTHER EYES BESIDES YOUR OWN
NEVER WITHIN MY REMEMBRANCE HAD HE MISSED THE IMPORTANT CEREMONIAL OF DINNER
I STARED AT HIM WITH HORROR AND DISGUST
THE PLEASURE OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK OVER AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY MADE ME EASY TO BE PLEASED AT OUR FIRST START
AND ON VERY SMALL PROVOCATION WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ALMS FOR THE RELIEF OF THE POOR INMATES
EVIDENTLY HE HAD GONE DEEPLY INTO THE MATTER ANALYTICALLY AND WITH PROFOUND SCRUTINY
THE VAST QUANTITY OF THIS UNWORKED FUEL WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO WARM THE WHOLE POPULATION OF ICELAND FOR A CENTURY
I WAS ALREADY DARTING DOWN THE GLOOMY TUNNEL WHEN THE PROFESSOR STOPPED ME
THE RUGGED PEAKS OF THE TRACHYTE ROCKS PRESENTED FAINT OUTLINES ON THE EASTERN HORIZON
THENCE SPRANG A FEVERISH STATE OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH THE IMPATIENT IRASCIBLE TRAVELLER DEVOTED TO PERDITION THE RAILWAY DIRECTORS AND THE STEAMBOAT COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENTS WHICH ALLOWED SUCH INTOLERABLE SLOWNESS
WHY WAS I DUMB AT SUCH A CRISIS
AT THIS MOMENT HANS CAME HE SAW MY HAND IN MY UNCLE'S AND I MAY SAFELY SAY THAT THERE WAS JOY IN HIS COUNTENANCE
FROM OUR STARTING POINT WE COULD SEE THE TWO PEAKS BOLDLY PROJECTED AGAINST THE DARK GREY SKY
FOR GREATER SAFETY I WRAPPED MYSELF IN A BLANKET AND CAME OUT OF THE GROTTO
WHO COULD PLACE MY FEET ON THE RIGHT PATH AND BRING ME BACK TO MY COMPANY
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY I WAS GOING TO PROSTRATE MYSELF BEFORE THIS WONDERFUL BOOK A WAY OF ANSWERING EQUALLY PLEASING TO GODS AND KINGS AND WHICH HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF NEVER GIVING THEM ANY EMBARRASSMENT WHEN A LITTLE INCIDENT HAPPENED TO DIVERT CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
BUT NO AXEL I KEPT IT FOR YOU MY DEAR UNCLE I SAID WHILST HOT TEARS TRICKLED DOWN MY FACE
HANS WILL TELL US THE NAME OF THAT ON WHICH WE ARE NOW STANDING THE QUESTION BEING PUT HANS REPLIED
EVERY MOMENT I NOTICED A FAIR-HAIRED AND RATHER MELANCHOLY FACE PEEPING OUT OF THE ROLLING VOLUMES OF SMOKE--THEY WERE A PERFECT CLUSTER OF UNWASHED ANGELS
ITS BODY--DUSKY ENORMOUS HILLOCKY--LIES SPREAD UPON THE SEA LIKE AN ISLET
THE LUGGAGE BEING LABELLED FOR COPENHAGEN WE HAD NO OCCASION TO LOOK AFTER IT
AND THAT IS ALL I WANT TO KNOW YES AXEL YOU ARE RIGHT
WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ROCKS OF THE TRANSITION OR SILURIAN 1 SYSTEM
EVERY DAY SHE HELPED ME TO ARRANGE MY UNCLE'S PRECIOUS SPECIMENS
I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES
I HAD TO BE RESIGNED AND TO WAIT SIX LONG HOURS
AS SOON AS WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL WE SHALL HAVE NO HESITATION AS TO THE PROPER ROAD TO TAKE DECIDEDLY MY UNCLE HAD ANSWERED EVERY ONE OF MY OBJECTIONS
I SORTED LABELLED AND ARRANGED IN THEIR OWN GLASS CASE ALL THESE HOLLOW SPECIMENS IN THE CAVITY OF EACH OF WHICH WAS A NEST OF LITTLE CRYSTALS
NOW GO SAID MY UNCLE AND RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO US DON'T BE UNEASY I REPLIED
AFTER TEN HOURS WALKING I OBSERVED A SINGULAR DEADENING OF THE REFLECTION OF OUR LAMPS FROM THE SIDE WALLS
BUT HE BECAME SO URGENT THAT I WAS AT LAST COMPELLED TO ANSWER
IT WILL LOOK VERY WELL UPON THE MAP PORT GRAEUBEN LET IT BE THEN AND SO THE CHERISHED REMEMBRANCE OF MY VIRLANDAISE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITION
FORTY SECONDS SAID MY UNCLE
I WAS YIELDING TO THE EFFECTS OF HUNGER AND COLD
TO THE NORTHWARD LAY SPREAD A VAST SHEET OF WATER SPARKLING AND DANCING UNDER THE HOT BRIGHT RAYS THE UNIFORMITY BROKEN HERE AND THERE BY THE TOPMAST OF A GALLANT SHIP APPEARING ABOVE THE HORIZON OR A SWELLING SAIL MOVING SLOWLY BEFORE THE WIND
I BELIEVE I DID NOT HEAR THE DULL ROAR OF THE EXPLOSION
DOWN BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING
IT IS READY I REPLIED WITH FALTERING VOICE
SERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT ALTONA WHICH IS BUT A SUBURB OF HAMBURG IS THE TERMINUS OF THE KIEL RAILWAY WHICH WAS TO CARRY US TO THE BELTS
VERY GOOD
VERY GOOD
OUR NAIAD THEN BEGAN TO TUMBLE BEFORE US WITH A HOARSER MURMUR AND WE WENT DOWN WITH HER TO A GREATER DEPTH
BUT UNLESS HE VERY CONSIDERABLY CHANGES AS HE GROWS OLDER AT THE END HE WILL BE A MOST ORIGINAL CHARACTER
THE TIDE I CRIED
IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT
YET HANS DID NOT THINK IT PRUDENT TO SPEND THE NIGHT UPON THE SIDES OF THE CONE
THOSE DANGERS WHICH OUR GUIDE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND I COULD HAVE DEMONSTRATED AND PROVED TO HIM
I WAS GETTING TIRED
NOW SAID MY UNCLE LET US BREAKFAST
AFTER SUPPER I LAID MYSELF DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE MAST AND FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDST OF FANTASTIC REVERIES
IN THE WALLS WERE DISTINCT IMPRESSIONS OF FUCOIDS AND LYCOPODITES
MY UNCLE LIES FULL LENGTH ACROSS THE RAFT
HANS WENT ON AS QUIETLY AS IF HE WERE ON LEVEL GROUND
OR HAVE NOT OTHERS BEEN HERE BEFORE ME YES HERR LIEDENBROCK
THAT IS SNAEFELL AH SAID MY UNCLE AS COOLLY AS HE WAS ABLE IS THAT SNAEFELL YES
IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY PRESERVED FOR A PURELY ANTHROPOLOGICAL END AND PURPOSE I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION
IN STATURE HE WAS AT LEAST TWELVE FEET HIGH
THE VAULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORED UP AND AS IT WAS THEY SEEMED TO BE HELD UP BY A MIRACLE OF EQUILIBRIUM
MY UNCLE AND HANS WERE STILL HOLDING ME FAST BY THE ARMS
THE PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPARTURE WERE NOT LONG IN MAKING AND WE WERE SOON ON OUR WAY DOWN A PASSAGE INCLINING TWO FEET IN SEVEN
PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK DEVOURED HIS PORTION VORACIOUSLY FOR HIS COMPULSORY FAST ON BOARD HAD CONVERTED HIS STOMACH INTO A VAST UNFATHOMABLE GULF
INFINITE PLEASURE
A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH ME
ANSWERING MY UNCLE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROAD AND OUR RESTING PLACE THAT NIGHT WITH MERELY YES OR NO EXCEPT WHEN HE SAID GARDAER I CONSULTED THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAER WAS
THAT IF IT CAME TO THE WORST WE SHOULD LAY VIOLENT HANDS ON HIM AND KEEP HIM AT HOME IF HE THOUGHT ON VENTURING ON THE EXPEDITION
EXCELLENT REPLIED CAPTAIN BJARNE
BUT THEY ARE ERRORS WHICH IT WAS GOOD TO FALL INTO FOR THEY LED TO THE TRUTH WHAT DEPTH HAVE WE NOW REACHED WE ARE THIRTY-FIVE LEAGUES BELOW THE SURFACE SO I SAID EXAMINING THE MAP THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND ARE OVER OUR HEADS AND THE GRAMPIANS ARE RAISING THEIR RUGGED SUMMITS ABOVE US YES ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR LAUGHING
BUT HOW WAS I TO RESIST THE SWEET VOICE WHICH WAS ALWAYS MUSIC TO MY EARS SAYING MY DEAR AXEL I CAME OUT OF MY ROOM
IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN
THERE WAS HOPE IN THIS
WHATEVER OBJECTIONS I HAZARDED AS TO THEIR QUALITY TEMPERATURE AND EVEN ABSENCE REMAINED INEFFECTUAL
THEN RAISING HIS SPECTACLES HE PRONOUNCED
FOR THE BINDING AND THE LEAVES ARE FLUSH ALL IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND NO GAPS OR OPENINGS ANYWHERE
BESIDES IF THE ASCENDING ROAD DID BECOME STEEPER I WAS COMFORTED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS BRINGING US NEARER TO THE SURFACE
HE OFFERED IT TO US EACH IN TURN AND THIS GENEROUS BEVERAGE CHEERED US UP SLIGHTLY
THE SEA IS CALM
STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED--"HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION
WE MUST GO BACK WHILE I SPOKE MY UNCLE AVOIDED LOOKING AT ME
MAY WE NOT EVEN EXPECT LIGHT FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THE PRESSURE OF WHICH MAY RENDER IT LUMINOUS AS WE APPROACH THE CENTRE YES YES SAID I
WHAT COULD THOSE WORDS MEAN?--WAS HE ACTUALLY GOING TO LISTEN TO REASON
WHAT COULD BE THE MEANING OF SUCH A CHANGE
YES WE MUST RECRUIT OUR STRENGTH BY CAREFULLY RATIONING OURSELVES AND SO PROLONG OUR EXISTENCE BY A FEW HOURS
AT OUR FEET THERE NOW OPENED A FRIGHTFUL ABYSS
BETWEEN TWO BOLDLY PROJECTING ROCKS APPEARED THE MOUTH OF A DARK TUNNEL
THEN RUSHING ON WITH RENEWED VIGOUR AND WITH GREAT ANIMATION
NOW YOU ARE A HERO AXEL SAID TO ME MY BLUSHING FIANCEE MY BETROTHED YOU WILL NOT LEAVE ME AGAIN I LOOKED TENDERLY UPON HER AND SHE SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS
AND ALL THE FEELING I HAD LEFT WAS JUST WHAT I IMAGINE MUST BE THE FEELING OF AN UNHAPPY CRIMINAL DOOMED TO BE BLOWN AWAY ALIVE FROM THE MOUTH OF A CANNON JUST BEFORE THE TRIGGER IS PULLED AND THE FLYING LIMBS AND RAGS OF FLESH AND SKIN FILL THE QUIVERING AIR AND SPATTER THE BLOOD-STAINED GROUND
THE COUNTRY WAS ALREADY ALMOST A DESERT
BY SOME PHENOMENON WHICH I AM UNABLE TO EXPLAIN IT LIGHTED UP ALL SIDES OF EVERY OBJECT EQUALLY
MY STARING EYES ARE FIXED VACANTLY UPON HIM
MY UNCLE ALONE FILLED MY THOUGHTS
HIS TEMPER IS AWFUL TO JUDGE FROM THE WORKING OF HIS FEATURES AS HE SEES THIS VAST LENGTH OF OCEAN UNROLLING BEFORE HIM TO AN INDEFINITE EXTENT
MY UNCLE REPLIED
COME SAID HE WE MUST DETERMINE UPON SOMETHING DETERMINE ON WHAT SAID I
AND OUR THIRST WAS SO INTENSE THAT TO SATISFY IT WE WOULD HAVE DARED THE WAVES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC
THEY HAD BEEN THE COVERINGS OF THOSE GIGANTIC GLYPTODONS OR ARMADILLOES OF THE PLEIOCENE PERIOD OF WHICH THE MODERN TORTOISE IS BUT A MINIATURE REPRESENTATIVE
BUT IF YOU ASK ME HOW HE CAME THERE HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
THE REMAINDER OF THE SEA MONSTERS HAVE DISAPPEARED
THERE IS SO LITTLE ACTION IN THIS MAN THAT HE WILL NEVER GET TIRED
MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE
I WONDERED THEREFORE WHERE COULD THIS MOUNTAIN BE AND IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD WE WERE TO BE SHOT OUT
IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON
TWO HOURS AFTER OUR DEPARTURE IT ONLY MARKED 10 DEG
FRIDRIKSSEN SNAEFELL
LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH WHOSE WINDINGS CROSSED EACH OTHER IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NO USE TO THINK OF FLIGHT ANY LONGER
OCCASIONALLY WE FELT QUITE CONVINCED
WHERE SHOULD I HAVE LOST MYSELF
THE PROFESSOR CEASED TO SPEAK AND THE AUDIENCE BROKE OUT INTO LOUD AND UNANIMOUS APPLAUSE
YET THERE WAS NO SENSIBLE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE
AND I RETURNED IN SILENCE TO MY LAVA SEAT IN A STATE OF UTTER SPEECHLESS CONSTERNATION
THE CHARGE WAS RAMMED INTO THE HOLE AND THE SLOW MATCH UNCOILED ALONG THE GALLERY SHOWED ITS END OUTSIDE THE OPENING
THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST
THIS WAS OUR LAST STAGE UPON THE EARTH
CAN IT BE I SAID
DOWN INTO THE CELLAR CRIED THE OLD SERVANT
THE VOWELS AND THE CONSONANTS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN EQUAL DISORDER
WITH THE OTHER ARM HE SUPPORTED MY UNCLE
I SAW HIM WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND LEGS STRADDLING WIDE APART ERECT BEFORE A GRANITE ROCK THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE CRATER JUST LIKE A PEDESTAL MADE READY TO RECEIVE A STATUE OF PLUTO
HERE'S SOME VERY BAD WEATHER COMING ON THE PROFESSOR MADE NO ANSWER
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL SUCH IS THE CONCLUSION OF A HISTORY WHICH I CANNOT EXPECT EVERYBODY TO BELIEVE FOR SOME PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE NOTHING AGAINST THE TESTIMONY OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE
WELL LET US GO ON TIDVATTEN SAID THE GUIDE
UPON EARTH IN THE MIDST OF THE DARKEST NIGHT LIGHT NEVER ABDICATES ITS FUNCTIONS ALTOGETHER
ON THE 11TH WE REACHED CAPE PORTLAND
TO MY STUPEFACTION AND UTTER DISMAY MY FEET TROD ONLY--THE ROUGH DRY GRANITE
FOUR DAYS LATER SATURDAY THE 18TH OF JULY IN THE EVENING WE ARRIVED AT A KIND OF VAST GROTTO
THE PROFESSOR AND HIS FAMILY ON THE 24TH OF MAY 1863 MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK RUSHED INTO HIS LITTLE HOUSE NO
TERROR
THIS WILL DO IT I SAID
HANS MY UNCLE AND MYSELF
I LOOK UP TO THE ATMOSPHERIC VAPOURS AND TRY TO FATHOM THEIR DEPTHS
THEN WE THANKED M
AS THE DAY BEFORE WE FOLLOWED THE PATH OF THE LAVA
LET US LOWER THE SAIL HE NODS HIS CONSENT
WELL NEVER MIND LET IT COOL MY UNCLE REPLIED
I THEREFORE APPROACHED THE WALL AND PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WAS DESPERATELY HUNGRY AND THAT AT DESSERT I SWALLOWED TO THE VERY LAST GULP OF A THICK BROTH MADE FROM BUCKWHEAT
4
HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF INTO A VELVET EASY-CHAIR AND WAS GRASPING BETWEEN HIS HANDS A BOOK OVER WHICH HE BENT PONDERING WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION
AT OUR LEFT WAS A HUGE BUILDING THAT LOOKED LIKE A HOSPITAL
I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
THE DARKNESS BECAME DEEPER AND THE LAST SOUND DIED AWAY IN THE FAR DISTANCE
MY UNCLE NEVER CEASED TO CONSULT HIS COMPASS TO KEEP ACCOUNT OF THE GROUND GONE OVER
FULL OF SELF POSSESSION HE CALMLY WORE HIS WAY THROUGH THE ROCK WITH A STEADY SUCCESSION OF LIGHT AND SKILFUL STROKES WORKING THROUGH AN APERTURE SIX INCHES WIDE AT THE OUTSIDE
IN TEN MINUTES MORE WE SHALL BE OFF AGAIN FOR OUR PRESENT BUSINESS LIES WITH AN INTERMITTENT VOLCANO
A NEGATIVE WAS EXPRESSED BY A SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AN AFFIRMATIVE BY A SLIGHT BEND SO SLIGHT THAT HIS LONG HAIR SCARCELY MOVED
MY UNCLE WHOM THE ABSORBING INCIDENTS OF THE COMBAT HAD DRAWN AWAY FROM HIS CONTEMPLATIONS BEGAN AGAIN TO LOOK IMPATIENTLY AROUND HIM
THIS PHENOMENON WHICH IS NOT UNFREQUENT WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM THE GLACIERS IS CALLED IN ICELANDIC MISTOUR HASTIGT
FOR SUCH NOVEL SENSATIONS NEW WORDS WERE WANTED
HERE WAS JUNE 25
HAMBURG GAVE A GRAND FETE IN OUR HONOUR
THERE IS NONE
AT SIX P.M
THE LIGHTNINGS DASH HITHER AND THITHER LIKE BROODS OF FIERY SERPENTS FILLING ALL THE AIR
XXX A NEW MARE INTERNUM XXXI PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY XXXII WONDERS OF THE DEEP XXXIII A BATTLE OF MONSTERS XXXIV THE GREAT GEYSER XXXV AN ELECTRIC STORM XXXVI CALM PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSIONS XXXVII THE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY XXXVIII THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN XXXIX FOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY XL PREPARATIONS FOR BLASTING A PASSAGE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH XLI THE GREAT EXPLOSION AND THE RUSH DOWN BELOW XLII HEADLONG SPEED UPWARD THROUGH THE HORRORS OF DARKNESS XLIII SHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO AT LAST
YES I AM CONVINCED THAT I AM RIGHT ARE WE THEN SPEEDING FORWARD TO SOME CATARACT WHICH WILL CAST US DOWN AN ABYSS
THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME
FAR AWAY ON ONE SIDE WAS THE GREEN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER THE SEA SPARKLED BATHED IN SUNLIGHT
HOW MANY PRISONERS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BECOME IDIOTS IF NOT MAD FOR WANT OF EXERCISE FOR THE THINKING FACULTY
NEXT MORNING WE AWOKE FRESH AND IN GOOD SPIRITS
A KEEPER WHO LIVED AT THE OTHER END OF THE STREET HANDED US THE KEY AND THE ASCENT BEGAN
I OPENED MY LANTERN
THE HEAT WAS PERFECTLY BEARABLE
SAID MY UNCLE WITH THE COLDEST CRUELTY
HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON
BUT MY UNCLE WENT ON SOLILOQUISING
WERE THEY ASLEEP
HANS KEEPS AT HIS POST AT THE HELM
IN FACT AT A DISTANCE OF A QUARTER OF A MILE LEANING AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A GIGANTIC KAURI STOOD A HUMAN BEING THE PROTEUS OF THOSE SUBTERRANEAN REGIONS A NEW SON OF NEPTUNE WATCHING THIS COUNTLESS HERD OF MASTODONS
WELL YOU WILL SEE GREATER SPLENDOURS THAN THESE I HOPE
FRIDRIKSSEN WHY WE POSSESS EIGHT THOUSAND VOLUMES MANY OF THEM VALUABLE AND SCARCE WORKS IN THE OLD SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE ALL THE NOVELTIES THAT COPENHAGEN SENDS US EVERY YEAR WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR EIGHT THOUSAND VOLUMES
BUT I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT MY UNCLE TALKED THE WHOLE TIME
THEY CAME AS IF PRONOUNCED IN LOW MURMURED WHISPERS
I WAS ORDERED TO DIRECT MY FEET THAT WAY
I AM HALF DEAD WITH HUNGER
THIS IS MY DECISION REPLIED PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK PUTTING ON ONE OF HIS GRANDEST AIRS
HE STOOD LIKE A MAN STUPEFIED BUT THE STUPEFACTION SOON GAVE WAY TO DELIRIOUS RAPTURE
WHAT NONSENSE
WELL SAID I DO YOU THINK WE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF BEING SAVED MY QUESTION WAS UNANSWERED
THAT FAVOURABLE MOMENT ARRIVED ONLY WITH SIX O'CLOCK
AS FOR ME MY THOUGHTS WERE MADE UP OF REMEMBRANCES AND THEY CARRIED ME UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE OF WHICH I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE TAKEN LEAVE
YOU KNOW THAT IT IS AT THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE THAT WEIGHT IS MOST SENSIBLY FELT AND THAT AT THE CENTRE THERE IS NO WEIGHT AT ALL I AM AWARE OF THAT
BUT I CANNOT BE SURE OF THAT UNTIL I HAVE REACHED THE VERY END OF THIS GALLERY YOU ARE RIGHT IN DOING THIS MY UNCLE AND I SHOULD QUITE APPROVE OF YOUR DETERMINATION IF THERE WERE NOT A DANGER THREATENING US NEARER AND NEARER WHAT DANGER THE WANT OF WATER WELL AXEL WE WILL PUT OURSELVES UPON RATIONS CHAPTER XX
AXEL FOLLOW ME I HAD SCARCELY HAD TIME TO MOVE WHEN THE PROFESSOR WAS AGAIN SHOUTING AFTER ME
I STOPPED
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
I SEE YOU ARE BETTER
YOU ARE A VERY INGENIOUS YOUNG MAN YOU HAVE DONE ME A SPLENDID SERVICE AT A MOMENT WHEN WEARIED OUT WITH THE STRUGGLE I WAS GOING TO ABANDON THE CONTEST
THE SOUND STRETCHED AWAY TO ELSINORE DOTTED WITH A FEW WHITE SAILS LIKE SEA-GULLS WINGS
BASALT IS A BROWNISH ROCK OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN
SILENCE REIGNED IN THIS GALLERY
WELL ADMITTING ALL YOUR CALCULATIONS TO BE QUITE CORRECT YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO DRAW ONE RIGID RESULT THEREFROM WHAT IS IT
FOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELECTRICITY FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR WE TROD UPON A PAVEMENT OF BONES
SHE COULD HAVE TAUGHT A FEW THINGS TO A SAVANT
MY UNCLE RECKONED UPON A FRESH SUPPLY FROM SUBTERRANEAN SOURCES BUT HITHERTO WE HAD MET WITH NONE
HE WAS TO CONTINUE IN MY UNCLE'S SERVICE FOR THE WHOLE PERIOD OF HIS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES FOR THE REMUNERATION OF THREE RIXDALES A WEEK ABOUT TWELVE SHILLINGS BUT IT WAS AN EXPRESS ARTICLE OF THE COVENANT THAT HIS WAGES SHOULD BE COUNTED OUT TO HIM EVERY SATURDAY AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM WAS ONE INDISPENSABLE PART OF THE ENGAGEMENT
I HAD COME TO THE LAST OF THE FRUIT WHEN A VERY LOUD VOICE TORE ME AWAY FROM THE PLEASURES OF MY DESSERT
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN 1577 OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
IF I HAD BEEN ALONE I MIGHT HAVE ONCE MORE TRIED THE EFFECT OF ARGUMENT
WAS MY UNCLE STARK MAD
BUT THE STOPPING UP OF THE HOLE WAS NOT SO EASY TO ACCOMPLISH
BUT STILL HE UNITED THE GENIUS OF A TRUE GEOLOGIST WITH THE KEEN EYE OF THE MINERALOGIST
A WHOLE WORLD OF IDEAS HAD OPENED IN MY MIND
BUT THE FAREWELL WAS PUT IN THE UNEXPECTED FORM OF A HEAVY BILL IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS CHARGED EVEN TO THE VERY AIR WE BREATHED IN THE PASTORAL HOUSE INFECTED AS IT WAS
THEN CAME THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF NATURE
THIS CAVERN WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN HEIGHT
IT IS NOT THERE THAT WE MUST SEEK FOR THE CAUSE OF THIS PHENOMENON
THE YOUNG GIRL STOPPED RATHER FRIGHTENED PERHAPS TO HEAR HER NAME CALLED AFTER HER ON THE HIGH ROAD
LET US TAKE A NIGHT'S REST AND IN THREE DAYS WE SHALL GET TO THE FORK IN THE ROAD YES SAID I IF WE HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT WHY NOT BECAUSE TO-MORROW WE SHALL HAVE NO WATER NOR COURAGE EITHER ASKED MY UNCLE SEVERELY
WELL NOW
THE CIRCUITOUS ROUTE THE DIAGONAL AND THE COUNTER MARCHES MUST HAVE MEASURED AT LEAST THREE LEAGUES
LET US LAND SAID THE PROFESSOR
FRIDRIKSSEN'S FACE
BUT AFTER ALL WHEN WE HAVE GONE DOWN WE SHALL HAVE TO GET UP AGAIN I SUPPOSE OH I DON'T TROUBLE MYSELF ABOUT THAT
I WENT UP TO MY ROOM
I THANKED GOD FROM MY HEART FOR IT WAS HE WHO HAD CONDUCTED ME THROUGH THOSE VAST SOLITUDES TO THE POINT WHERE ALONE OF ALL OTHERS PERHAPS THE VOICES OF MY COMPANIONS COULD HAVE REACHED ME
I TRY TO MOVE MY FOOT AWAY BUT CANNOT
I BEGAN TO RUN WILDLY HURRYING THROUGH THE INEXTRICABLE MAZE STILL DESCENDING STILL RUNNING THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE EARTH'S THICK CRUST A STRUGGLING DENIZEN OF GEOLOGICAL FAULTS CRYING SHOUTING YELLING SOON BRUISED BY CONTACT WITH THE JAGGED ROCK FALLING AND RISING AGAIN BLEEDING TRYING TO DRINK THE BLOOD WHICH COVERED MY FACE AND EVEN WAITING FOR SOME ROCK TO SHATTER MY SKULL AGAINST
NEXT MORNING WE AWOKE HALF FROZEN BY THE SHARP KEEN AIR BUT WITH THE LIGHT OF A SPLENDID SUN
SOME MINUTES PASSED
THEN THE TWO PLACING THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR HEARTS INCLINED PROFOUNDLY BEFORE US
IF THERE IS A WAY TO PENETRATE INTO THE VERY BOWELS OF THE ISLAND IF THAT ILL-ADVISED SAKNUSSEMM HAS TOLD A TRUE TALE WE SHALL LOSE OUR WAY AMIDST THE DEEP SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES OF THIS VOLCANO
YES GENTLEMEN I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS AND MORE
RARE PRIVILEGE
I EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO CONDEMN MYSELF FOR MY ABSURDITY IN HAVING WAITED SO LONG AND I FINALLY RESOLVED TO LET IT ALL OUT
HOW I WISHED AT THIS MOMENT I COULD HAVE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND ME
CAN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN AND MOON BE FELT DOWN HERE WHY NOT
IT WAS NO DOUBT THE SAME ROAD THAT SAKNUSSEMM HAD TAKEN
GRADUALLY WE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO THROW ASIDE OUR COATS AND WAISTCOATS THE LIGHTEST COVERING BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE AND EVEN PAINFUL
AND AT SIX THE PROFESSOR GAVE THE SIGNAL TO EMBARK
AND HOW ABOUT HIS DINNER SAID THE OLD SERVANT
AND THERE IS A GEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION OF THE FACT
I TREMBLED TOO VERY UNNECESSARILY SINCE THE TRUE KEY WAS IN MY HANDS AND NO OTHER WOULD OPEN THE SECRET
HOW DO YOU DO HANS
THE DARKNESS DEEPENS
PLANTS DISAPPEAR
HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY JUST LIKE INHABITANTS OF THE UPPER EARTH
THIS UNHOPED-FOR CATCH RECRUITED OUR STOCK OF PROVISIONS
AND IRREPARABLE DISASTER
IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT WE WERE BEING HURRIED UPWARD UPON THE CREST OF A WAVE OF ERUPTION
I FELT WONDERFULLY STRONGER AND QUITE DECIDED UPON PUSHING ON
2 RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS CONSISTS OF A BUNSEN PILE WORKED WITH BICHROMATE OF POTASH WHICH MAKES NO SMELL
I OPENED IT AND BEGAN TO WATCH IT
BUT I HAVE A BETTER TO PROPOSE I SAID
EVERY LETTER WAS GIVEN ME ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE RESULT
WE WERE HENCEFORTH TO BE HURLED ALONG THE PLAYTHINGS OF THE FIERCE ELEMENTS OF THE DEEP
NEVER WAS SOLITUDE EQUAL TO THIS NEVER HAD ANY LIVING BEING BEEN SO UTTERLY FORSAKEN
AND HERE ARE WE SCUDDING LIKE LUNATICS BEFORE THE WIND TO GET NEAR TO A MONSTER THAT A HUNDRED WHALES A DAY WOULD NOT SATISFY
A DESCENT OF SEVEN HOURS CONSECUTIVELY IS NOT MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE EXPENDITURE OF STRENGTH
HENCE THEN THE VOLCANO WOULD DISTEND AND LIFT UP THE CRUST AND THEN BURST THROUGH A CRATER SUDDENLY FORMED AT THE SUMMIT OR THINNEST PART OF THE VOLCANO
WHERE THIS VAULT RESTED UPON ITS GRANITE BASE NO EYE COULD TELL
WHAT DELICIOUS WALKS WE SHOULD HAVE HAD TOGETHER MY PRETTY VIRLANDAISE AND I ALONG THE HARBOUR WHERE THE TWO-DECKERS AND THE FRIGATE SLEPT PEACEABLY BY THE RED ROOFING OF THE WAREHOUSE BY THE GREEN BANKS OF THE STRAIT THROUGH THE DEEP SHADES OF THE TREES AMONGST WHICH THE FORT IS HALF CONCEALED WHERE THE GUNS ARE THRUSTING OUT THEIR BLACK THROATS BETWEEN BRANCHES OF ALDER AND WILLOW
I THEREFORE HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO GET AWAY TO THE RAFT
THE LATELY ROARING WINDS ARE HUSHED INTO A DEAD CALM
MY UNCLE ROSE UP
AND HE WAS RIGHT
AN ENORMOUS FORCE A FORCE OF HUNDREDS OF ATMOSPHERES GENERATED BY THE EXTREME PRESSURE OF CONFINED VAPOURS WAS DRIVING US IRRESISTIBLY FORWARD
A MINE WITHOUT MINERS MY UNCLE REPLIED
HIS IMAGINATION IS A VOLCANO AND TO DO THAT WHICH OTHER GEOLOGISTS HAVE NEVER DONE HE WOULD RISK HIS LIFE
SHE HAD TO TACK AGAINST THE NORTH WIND AND REACHED THE FAROES ONLY WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT LEAVE OUR ISLAND UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN SOME OF ITS MINERALOGICAL WEALTH CERTAINLY REPLIED MY UNCLE
THESE TREASURES HAVE BEEN BURIED AT SUCH A PROFOUND DEPTH BY THE CONVULSIONS OF PRIMEVAL TIMES THAT THEY RUN NO CHANCE OF EVER BEING MOLESTED BY THE PICKAXE OR THE SPADE
THE RANGE OF THE EYE EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
WHEN MARRIED THEY PUT AROUND THEIR HEADS A COLOURED HANDKERCHIEF CROWNED WITH A PEAK OF WHITE LINEN
I WALKED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
HERE AND THERE I GOT A GLIMPSE OF FADED TURF LOOKING LIKE A WORN-OUT BIT OF CARPET OR SOME APPEARANCE OF A KITCHEN GARDEN THE SPARSE VEGETABLES OF WHICH POTATOES CABBAGES AND LETTUCES WOULD HAVE FIGURED APPROPRIATELY UPON A LILLIPUTIAN TABLE
HERE WE ARE EXCLAIMED MY UNCLE AT THE VERY END OF THE CHIMNEY I LOOKED AROUND ME
NOW THE PART OF EJECTED SCORIAE AND ASHES SEEMED TO MY MIND A VERY ROUGH ONE TO ACT
I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART
IT WILL REPLIED MY UNCLE
THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED
I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE AND THE DEAFENING CONTINUOUS DIN AWAKED BY EVERY STONE AGAINST WHICH THEY BOUNDED
CALM PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSIONS HERE I END WHAT I MAY CALL MY LOG HAPPILY SAVED FROM THE WRECK AND I RESUME MY NARRATIVE AS BEFORE
THE HELM MAKES A BOUND
IT IS QUITE NATURAL YOU MAY SAY SO UNCLE
OF COURSE I WAS NOT INCLINED TO ARGUE
BUT A DISCOVERY CAME TO COMPLICATE MATTERS AND MAKE THEM WORSE
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE
WITHIN A RADIUS OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES TO THE WEST I REMEMBERED UNDER THIS PARALLEL OF LATITUDE ONLY THE IMPERFECTLY KNOWN VOLCANOES OF THE NORTH-EAST COAST OF AMERICA
AND YOURS REPLIED THE INDEFATIGABLE PROFESSOR ENTERING THE DINING-ROOM
TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED
WHAT CAN BE THIS CETACEAN WHICH NEITHER CUVIER NOR BLUMENBACH KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT
HERE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF SNAEFELL AND HERE ARE TWO PEAKS ONE NORTH AND ONE SOUTH
THE INTERNAL FIRES HAD NOT YET FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH
I COULD NO LONGER DOUBT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT WONDERFUL TRAVELLER AND OF THE FACT OF HIS UNPARALLELED JOURNEY WITHOUT THE MOST GLARING INCREDULITY
MY PRETTY VIRLANDAISE WAS AS CALM AND COLLECTED AS WAS HER WONT
GOOD MORNING AXEL HE CRIED CHEERILY
I FOLLOWED HIM NOT WITHOUT FEAR
PICTURSSEN THE BISHOP'S SUFFRAGAN AND M
MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
AT THAT MOMENT THE LIGHT FROM OUR LANTERN BEGAN TO SINK BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND THEN WENT OUT ENTIRELY
OUR EARS ARE BLEEDING
SHE WAS FOND OF INVESTIGATING ABSTRUSE SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS
THE LIEDENBROCK MUSEUM OF GEOLOGY HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE THE STRANGE SERIES OF PASSIONS WHICH IN SUCCESSION SHOOK THE BREAST OF PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
THE CRATER OF SNAEFELL RESEMBLED AN INVERTED CONE THE OPENING OF WHICH MIGHT BE HALF A LEAGUE IN DIAMETER
DO YOU WANT ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS OF COURSE NOT I REPLIED IN THE TONE OF AN INJURED MAN
BUT AS FOR REACHING IT HIMSELF AS FOR PERFORMING THE JOURNEY AND RETURNING IF HE EVER WENT I SAY NO--HE NEVER NEVER DID THAT NOW FOR YOUR REASON SAID MY UNCLE IRONICALLY
WE HAD BECOME ENGAGED UNKNOWN TO MY UNCLE WHO WAS TOO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH GEOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO SUCH FEELINGS AS OURS
AS IF THE CREATOR PRESSED FOR TIME IN THE FIRST HOURS OF THE WORLD HAD ASSEMBLED SEVERAL ANIMALS INTO ONE THE COLOSSAL MASTODON XXXII
BUT ALAS
GRAEUBEN I CRIED FROM AFAR OFF
WE SHOULD THEN PUSH OFF AS FAR AS WE COULD AND AVOID THE DANGERS ARISING FROM THE EXPLOSION THE EFFECTS OF WHICH WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE CONFINED TO THE ROCK ITSELF
THERE STANDS THE BODY
TAKE DOWN THE THIRD ATLAS IN THE SECOND SHELF IN THE LARGE BOOKCASE SERIES Z PLATE 4 I ROSE AND WITH THE HELP OF SUCH PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS COULD NOT FAIL TO FIND THE REQUIRED ATLAS
BUT FIRST LET US EXAMINE THIS NEW GALLERY TO SEE IF WE SHALL REQUIRE OUR LADDERS MY UNCLE PUT HIS RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS IN ACTION
HALT HE CRIED
AND HERE IS A FACT WHICH SCIENCE HAS SCARCELY SUSPECTED SCIENCE MY LAD HAS BEEN BUILT UPON MANY ERRORS
EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
TAKE CARE AXEL OR YOU WILL FALL OVERBOARD AT THAT MOMENT I FELT THE SINEWY HAND OF HANS SEIZING ME VIGOROUSLY
OUR FLUID ALIMENT WAS NOW NOTHING BUT GIN
ONLY MY SENSE OF SMELL WAS FORCIBLY AFFECTED BY AN ODOUR OF PROTOCARBURET OF HYDROGEN
AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION
BUT DON'T DESPAIR AXEL
IT CERTAINLY IS A MENAGERIE FOR THESE REMAINS WERE NOT BROUGHT HERE BY A DELUGE
SUCH WAS THE SUCCESSION OF PHENOMENA WHICH PRODUCED ICELAND ALL ARISING FROM THE ACTION OF INTERNAL FIRE
I MIGHT NOW EITHER SHARE IN THE ENTERPRISE OR REFUSE TO MOVE FORWARD
MY WORDS MY COMPLAINTS MY SORROW WOULD HAVE HAD SOME INFLUENCE OVER THAT FRIGID NATURE
HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
WHILE THE TRANSLATION IS FAIRLY LITERAL AND MALLESON A CLERGYMAN HAS TAKEN PAINS WITH THE SCIENTIFIC PORTIONS OF THE WORK AND ADDED THE CHAPTER HEADINGS HE HAS MADE SOME UNFORTUNATE EMENDATIONS MAINLY CONCERNING BIBLICAL REFERENCES AND HAS ADDED A FEW IMPROVEMENTS OF HIS OWN WHICH ARE DETAILED BELOW
A HOLE WAS TO BE MADE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD FIFTY POUNDS OF GUNCOTTON WHOSE EXPANSIVE FORCE IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF GUNPOWDER
BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
HE WOULD WANT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
WE KEPT GOING DOWN A KIND OF WINDING STAIRCASE WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE HAND OF MAN
BROOKS AND WATERFALLS WERE TUMBLING EVERYWHERE FROM THE PROJECTIONS IN THE ROCKS
IT WAS A THREE DAYS MARCH TO THE CROSS ROADS
HE IS A BOLD PHILOSOPHER A MAN OF IMMENSE COURAGE AND YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HIS BLOOD FLOWS IN YOUR VEINS
FIVE MINUTES MORE HE SAID
I COULD HEAR A LOUDER NOISE OF FLOWING WATERS AND I FANCIED I COULD FEEL THE DELICIOUS FLUID REFRESHING MY PARCHED LIPS
WAS HE CONTEMPLATING THE ABANDONMENT OF HIS PLANS
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY EVERYTHING HAVING GONE ON WELL SO FAR BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET DOWN BELOW THIS LIQUID SURFACE OH I AM NOT GOING TO DIVE HEAD FOREMOST
NEITHER YOU NOR ANYBODY ELSE KNOWS WITH ANY CERTAINTY WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS GLOBE SINCE NOT THE TWELVE THOUSANDTH PART OF ITS RADIUS IS KNOWN
WE HAD ONLY ONE DAY'S PROVISIONS LEFT
CHAPTER XXXVII
WELL AXEL SAID MY UNCLE WE ARE GETTING ON AND NOW THE WORST IS OVER THE WORST I SAID ASTONISHED
IN THE EVENING WE DINED WITH BARON TRAMPS
BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER I SAW THAT WE HAD TO DO WITH A BLACKSMITH A FISHERMAN A HUNTER A JOINER BUT NOT AT ALL WITH A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
THE GALLERY IS WIDENING AND IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY WE SHALL ABANDON THE RAFT AND CREEP INTO A CREVICE BUT THE WATER--THE RISING WATER THERE IS NO MORE WATER AXEL
HE SEIZED HIS HEAD BETWEEN BOTH HIS HANDS
VERY FAR FROM IT
HANS SILENCE SEEMED TO BE INFECTING US
FOR A TIME SHE WAS SILENT
THERE WAS NO WANT OF CORDAGE FOR THE RIGGING AND EVERYTHING WAS WELL AND FIRMLY MADE
DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND
HANS HAD NEVER HAD AN OBJECT LIKE THIS IN HIS POSSESSION
THEN IT IS LUCKY I HAVE EATEN TWO DINNERS TO-DAY FIRST OF ALL WE MUST FIND OUT THE KEY TO THIS CIPHER
THE GENIUS OF DISCOVERY POSSESSED ME WHOLLY
EFTER SAID HE
HAPPILY OUR LIGHT WAS FROM RUHMKORFF'S INGENIOUS APPARATUS
BUT WHAT DOES THE THERMOMETER SAY HARDLY FIFTEEN DEGREES 59 DEG
I RETURN TO THE BIBLICAL EPOCHS OF THE CREATION WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE BIRTH OF MAN WHEN THE INCOMPLETE EARTH WAS NOT YET SUFFICIENT FOR HIM XXXVIII
DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE SAID HOLDING OUT HER HAND
MY EYES HAD FALLEN UPON A CHARMING PICTURE SUSPENDED AGAINST THE WALL THE PORTRAIT OF GRAEUBEN
HE FORMED A SMALL BALL OF THE METALS WHICH I HAVE NAMED AND WHICH WAS A VERY FAIR REPRESENTATION OF OUR GLOBE
WITTY AND INGENIOUS ADAPTATIONS OF THE RESEARCHES AND DISCOVERIES OF MODERN SCIENCE TO THE POPULAR TASTE WHICH DEMANDS THAT THESE SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO ORDINARY READERS IN THE LIGHTER FORM OF CLEVERLY MINGLED TRUTH AND FICTION THESE BOOKS WILL ASSUREDLY BE READ WITH PROFIT AND DELIGHT ESPECIALLY BY ENGLISH YOUTH
MUST WE THEN ALL DIE OF HUNGER I HARDLY DARED TO CONFESS THAT WITH SO ABSOLUTE A RULER AS MY UNCLE THIS FATE WAS INEVITABLE
HE HIMSELF SEEMED TO POSSESS AN INSTINCT FOR EQUILIBRIUM FOR HE NEVER STUMBLED
ALL THIS IMMENSITY OF SPACE WHIRLED AND WAVERED FLUCTUATING BENEATH MY EYES
FRIDRIKSSEN STARTING
THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS PROPAGATION OF SOUNDS WHICH REMAIN UNHEARD IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE
AT ONE MOMENT THE TUNNEL BECOMING VERY NARROW I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL
WE ARE ONLY THIRTY-FIVE LEAGUES FROM IT
WOULD HE RETURN IN TRIUMPH OR IN DISCOURAGEMENT
AND SO WE ARRIVED AT A PLACE WHERE THE SHORE WAS MUCH NARROWED
NO DOUBT WE MUST WAIT FOR THE TIDE FOERBIDA SAID MY UNCLE
CHAPTER XVII
LEPIDODENDRA WITH CYLINDRICAL FORKED STEMS TERMINATED BY LONG LEAVES AND BRISTLING WITH ROUGH HAIRS LIKE THOSE OF THE CACTUS
6
FORTUNATELY AFTER AN HOUR OF FATIGUE AND ATHLETIC EXERCISES IN THE MIDST OF THE VAST SURFACE OF SNOW PRESENTED BY THE HOLLOW BETWEEN THE TWO PEAKS A KIND OF STAIRCASE APPEARED UNEXPECTEDLY WHICH GREATLY FACILITATED OUR ASCENT
A LIGHT FOAM FLEW OVER THE WAVES BEFORE THE BREATH OF A MODERATE BREEZE AND SOME OF THE SPRAY FELL UPON MY FACE
THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW EARLY I COULD HEAR NO MORE
4_D THEN I TOOK A CHILDISH PLEASURE IN EXPLORING THE CITY
SEE HE WENT ON BOTH ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND SUPPLYING THE ANSWERS
FOR THE TIME WE MUST BE RESIGNED TO WAIT FOR THE HONOUR OF BEING PRESENTED TO HIM
I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED-HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
WON'T YOU OH THAT IS VERY UNINTERESTING TO ME
I WAS STIFLING
UNCLE THAT KEY WHAT KEY
IT IS ONLY AN ACCIDENTAL OBSTRUCTION NOT MET BY SAKNUSSEMM AND IF WE DON'T DESTROY IT WE SHALL BE UNWORTHY TO REACH THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH SUCH WAS MY SENTENCE
ON THE 8TH THE CAPTAIN MADE OUT MYGANNESS THE SOUTHERNMOST OF THESE ISLANDS AND FROM THAT MOMENT TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE FOR CAPE PORTLAND THE MOST SOUTHERLY POINT OF ICELAND
HAVE WE TAKEN ALIVE AN INHABITANT OF THE SEAS OF PRIMITIVE AGES YES
AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT ALI YOU THINK SO DO YOU AXEL MY BOY
HE MAY EVEN HAVE HEARD THE LEGENDARY STORIES TOLD IN HIS DAY ABOUT THAT CRATER REACHING TO THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD
THESE REASONS SEEMED EXCELLENT TO ME THOUGH ON THE NIGHT BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE REJECTED THEM WITH INDIGNATION
I FOLLOWED HER AND HARDLY KNOWING HOW I GOT THERE I FOUND MYSELF SEATED IN MY USUAL PLACE
I THOUGHT I COULD SEE FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATERS ENORMOUS CHELONIA PRE-ADAMITE TORTOISES RESEMBLING FLOATING ISLANDS
AND IT IS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO US YES REPLIED THE PROFESSOR EYEING ME OVER HIS SPECTACLES I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY OF REACHING THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH I PASS RAPIDLY OVER THE THOUSAND IDEAS WHICH PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
THIS METHOD OF GETTING ON MAY PLEASE THE PROFESSOR BECAUSE IT IS VERTICAL
WELL NOW SAID I TO MYSELF IF THAT MOST IMPATIENT OF MEN IS HUNGRY WHAT A DISTURBANCE HE WILL MAKE M
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PERPENDICULAR CHIMNEY HE ANSWERED
OUR COMPASS WAS NO LONGER A GUIDE
BUT FOR THE RAPIDITY OF OUR ASCENT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFOCATED
ITS ACTION WAS FELT TO THE VERY LAST COATS OF THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST
THE TORCH CRIED THE PROFESSOR
BUT I AM RATHER LATE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THE MATTER
MY UNCLE WOULD HAVE MET IT WITH HIS INEVITABLE SAKNUSSEMM A PRECEDENT WHICH POSSESSED NO WEIGHT WITH ME
WE HAD STARTED AT ONE IT MUST THEREFORE NOW BE ELEVEN O'CLOCK
NO REPLY
MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS
IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT IN M
WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THE HORRORS OF FAMINE WHEN DEATH WAS SWOOPING DOWN UPON US IN A MULTITUDE OF OTHER FORMS
AND HOW OFTEN I ENVIED THE VERY STONES WHICH SHE HANDLED WITH HER CHARMING FINGERS
THEN I DROPPED DOWN INTO THE OLD VELVET ARMCHAIR MY HEAD THROWN BACK AND MY HANDS JOINED OVER IT
ITS SURFACE SEEMED COMPOSED OF A SHEAF OF ARROWS HURLED WITH INCONCEIVABLE FORCE
ONLY A LAVA PASTE WHICH IS BEARING US UP ON ITS SURFACE TO THE TOP OF THE CRATER THE LIQUID COLUMN HAD INDEED DISAPPEARED TO GIVE PLACE TO DENSE AND STILL BOILING ERUPTIVE MATTER OF ALL KINDS
IN MANY PLACES WE WERE OBLIGED TO PUSH OURSELVES ALONG WITH IRON-POINTED STICKS
THE HORSES DID THEIR DUTY WELL NO DIFFICULTIES STOPPED THEM IN THEIR STEADY CAREER
IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE STANDING UPON THE SURFACE OF A ROCK JAMMED IN ACROSS THE CHIMNEY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
THE OAK AND THE PALM WERE GROWING SIDE BY SIDE THE AUSTRALIAN EUCALYPTUS LEANED AGAINST THE NORWEGIAN PINE THE BIRCH-TREE OF THE NORTH MINGLED ITS FOLIAGE WITH NEW ZEALAND KAURIS
HERE IS THE TIDE RISING I CRIED
THE WOMEN LOOKED AS SAD AND AS RESIGNED AS THE MEN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLOWN-UP ROCK WAS AN ABYSS
WE MUST RETURN I EXCLAIMED VEHEMENTLY
I THEREFORE TOOK REFUGE IN OTHER DARK PASSAGES OF THE DOCUMENT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHAT ROCKS WE WERE PASSING
VERNE'S BOOK A MANOMETER IS THE INSTRUMENT USED OF WHICH VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN
IT WAS A PEASANT'S HOUSE BUT IN POINT OF HOSPITALITY IT WAS EQUAL TO A KING'S
HOW MANY MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND VOLCANOES THERE ARE TO STUDY WHICH ARE AS YET BUT IMPERFECTLY KNOWN
AND NEVER HAD HE SEEMED TO ME MORE DARING AND MORE CONFIRMED IN HIS NOTIONS THAN AT THIS MOMENT WHEN HE WAS CALMLY CONTEMPLATING THE CHANCES OF BEING SHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO
THIS MOST CURIOUS ISLAND HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN PROJECTED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AT A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE
IT WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN OPPOSING A WILL HARDER THAN THE GRANITE ROCK
THE NEEDLE FLEW FROM POLE TO POLE WITH A KIND OF FRENZIED IMPULSE
I GAZED PAINFULLY UPON THE LUMINOUS CURRENT GROWING WEAKER AND WEAKER IN THE WIRE COIL
YES--A MAN HAS AND WHO WAS THAT MAN A MAN WHO HAS ENGRAVED HIS NAME SOMEWHERE WITH THAT DAGGER
HERE IS MICA SCHIST
AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT
ALL I KNOW IS THAT AT EACH FRESH IMPULSE WE WERE HURLED FORWARD WITH A GREATLY INCREASED FORCE AND WE SEEMED AS IF WE WERE MERE PROJECTILES
IN HIS DESIRE TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAR THE PICTURE OF ICELAND DRAWN IN THE WORK OF JULES VERNE IS A CORRECT ONE THE TRANSLATOR HOPES IN THE COURSE OF A MAIL OR TWO TO RECEIVE A COMMUNICATION FROM A LEADING MAN OF SCIENCE IN THE ISLAND WHICH MAY FURNISH MATTER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN A FUTURE EDITION
WHILST WE WERE THUS ENJOYING THE SWEETS OF REPOSE A CHILD APPEARED OUT OF A GROVE OF OLIVE TREES
AND THE RAFT WAS STILL CARRYING US
HE WOULD START HE WOULD IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND HE WOULD TAKE ME WITH HIM AND WE SHOULD NEVER GET BACK
MY LATIN MEMORIES ROSE IN REVOLT AGAINST THE NOTION THAT THESE BARBAROUS WORDS COULD BELONG TO THE SWEET LANGUAGE OF VIRGIL
AFTER BUILDING THE NEST SHE FEATHERS IT WITH DOWN PLUCKED FROM HER OWN BREAST
THE PROFESSOR FASTENED HIS PACKAGE OF INSTRUMENTS UPON HIS SHOULDERS
WITH MY REVIVING SPIRITS THESE MYTHOLOGICAL NOTIONS SEEMED TO COME UNBIDDEN
I HAD THREE DAYS PROVISIONS WITH ME AND MY FLASK WAS FULL
SO THAT WE SHALL EMERGE FROM SOME POINT IN THE EARTH'S CIRCUMFERENCE INSTEAD OF GETTING TO THE CENTRE CONFUSION TO ALL YOUR FIGURES AND ALL YOUR HYPOTHESES BESIDES SHOUTED MY UNCLE IN A SUDDEN RAGE
BY THE FLICKERING LIGHT OF THE TORCH I COULD DISTINGUISH CONTORTIONS IN THE GRANITE BEDS
THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION HAD BEEN AT WORK ALL THE WHILE THAT WE WERE ASLEEP AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE
WORDS FAILED ME TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE ASKED
WHY AM I UNABLE TO MOVE MY FOOT
NOW SAID MY UNCLE NOW IS THE TIME FOR HIGH TIDE AND WE MUST NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THIS PHENOMENON WHAT
WHAT COULD WE DO IN THE MIDST OF A HERD OF THESE FOUR-FOOTED GIANTS
AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL
WHEN THE APPARATUS IS PUT IN ACTION THIS GAS BECOMES LUMINOUS PRODUCING A WHITE STEADY LIGHT
IT HAS ARISEN MATHEMATICALLY IN OBEDIENCE TO THE UNKNOWN LAW WHICH HAS RULED IN THE SUCCESSION OF THESE LETTERS
SHOT OUT OF A VOLCANO AT LAST
I FOLLOWED HIM NOT WITHOUT ALARM FOR MY HEAD WAS VERY APT TO FEEL DIZZY
IT WAS CLOSE DIRTY AND EVIL SMELLING
BEFORE ITS DISORDERS SET IN THE NEEDLE HAD NEVER DEVIATED FROM THAT DIRECTION
SO I SAID NOTHING AND COULD EAT NOTHING
AND HE MAY EVEN BOAST THE DISTINGUISHED HONOUR OF AN OFFER FROM MR BARNUM TO EXHIBIT HIM ON MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES
I HASTEN TO INFORM THE READER THAT THIS ICELANDIC LADY WAS THE MOTHER OF NINETEEN CHILDREN ALL BIG AND LITTLE SWARMING IN THE MIDST OF THE DENSE WREATHS OF SMOKE WITH WHICH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH FILLED THE CHAMBER
WHO CAN TELL
ON THE WHOLE THAT DAY AND THE NEXT WE MADE CONSIDERABLE WAY HORIZONTALLY VERY LITTLE VERTICALLY
AND NOW THERE IS NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE SEAS AND CONTINENTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH NO DOUBT SAID MY UNCLE
BUT FOR ALL THAT THERE WAS NO LULL YET IN THE ADMIRING EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PROFESSOR
DID HER HEART PALPITATE AS MINE DID
I THOUGHT HIM SINGULARLY LUKEWARM
I BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TALKING OF TYPE WRETCHED AXEL
THREE HOURS LATER STILL TREADING ON THE COLOURLESS GRASS OF THE PASTURE LAND WE HAD TO WORK ROUND THE KOLLA FIORD A LONGER WAY BUT AN EASIER ONE THAN ACROSS THAT INLET
HEADLONG SPEED UPWARD THROUGH THE HORRORS OF DARKNESS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS I GUESSED ABOUT TEN AT NIGHT
WHEN I REOPENED THEM I SAW MY TWO COMPANIONS MOTIONLESS AND ROLLED UP IN THEIR COVERINGS
IF OUR DIFFICULTIES BECAME NO WORSE WE MIGHT HOPE TO REACH OUR END
SHE WAS NO MORE MOVED THAN IF I HAD BEEN STARTING FOR A LITTLE TRIP TO LUEBECK OR HELIGOLAND
THE NIGHT PASSED AWAY IN CONTINUAL ASCENT
HER LITTLE HANDS MOVED WITHOUT HASTE
THE SLOPE WAS RAPID AND I SLID DOWN
THE SLOPE OF THIS GALLERY WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND ITS SECTIONS VERY UNEQUAL
AND AS IT IS IN MY POWER TO PREVENT THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT COMING INTO THE MIND OF MY TYRANT I WILL DO IT
I AGREE WITH YOU MOST HEARTILY WELL LET US REST AWHILE
TREE FERNS AS TALL AS OUR FIR-TREES IN NORTHERN LATITUDES
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CLIMB THEM AND THESE STONY CLIFFS HAD TO BE TACKED ROUND NOT WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY
FOR HALF AN HOUR I MET WITH NO OBSTACLE
IT IS RESOLVED INTO ITS CONSTITUENT ATOMS SUBTILISED VOLATILISED
HAD I BEEN LISTENING TO THE MAD SPECULATIONS OF A LUNATIC OR TO THE SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS OF A LOFTY GENIUS
WE WERE STANDING AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO ROADS BOTH DARK AND NARROW
BUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE TOO STAPI IS A VILLAGE CONSISTING OF ABOUT THIRTY HUTS BUILT OF LAVA AT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BASE OF THE VOLCANO
IMPRUDENTLY THEREFORE WE PURSUE OUR WAY
WE REMAIN MOTIONLESS READY TO FIRE
SUPPOSE SOME DISPLACEMENT SHOULD OCCUR AND CRUSH US ALL
AN EIGEL'S CENTIGRADE THERMOMETER GRADUATED UP TO 150 DEGREES 302 DEGREES FAHR WHICH SEEMED TO ME TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE
WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO
BUT THEIR ROOTS DREW VIGOROUS LIFE FROM THE BURNING SOIL OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS PLANET
I COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AT THE MOMENT
COME UP SIR
IT WAS YET RESERVED FOR MY UNCLE TO BE COMPLETELY HAPPY
IF MY EYES WERE ABLE TO RANGE AFAR OVER THIS GREAT SEA IT WAS BECAUSE A PECULIAR LIGHT BROUGHT TO VIEW EVERY DETAIL OF IT
WHO KNOWS I ASKED
BENEATH OUR RAFT WERE BOILING WATERS AND UNDER THESE THE MORE SLUGGISH LAVA WAS WORKING ITS WAY UP IN A HEATED MASS TOGETHER WITH SHOALS OF FRAGMENTS OF ROCK WHICH WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE CRATER WOULD BE DISPERSED IN ALL DIRECTIONS HIGH AND LOW
MY UNCLE POUNCED UPON THIS SHRED WITH INCREDIBLE AVIDITY
THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE CLOUDS ARE FLYING HIGH ARE LIGHT AND BATHED IN A WHITE ATMOSPHERE RESEMBLING SILVER IN A STATE OF FUSION
THEN I BEGAN TO HEAR DISTINCTLY QUITE A NEW SOUND OF SOMETHING RUNNING WITHIN THE THICKNESS OF THE GRANITE WALL A KIND OF DULL DEAD RUMBLING LIKE DISTANT THUNDER
THE STEAMER ELLENORA DID NOT START UNTIL NIGHT
HANS WANTS TO TACK TO GET AWAY FROM THIS DANGEROUS NEIGHBOURHOOD
NO NOT YET
BUT NOW WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
IN A FEW MORE STEPS I WAS AT HIS SIDE
WAS I INDEED IN ADVANCE WHEN WE BECAME SEPARATED
TO THE WEST DISTANT COASTS LINED THE DIM HORIZON ON SOME ROSE BLUE MOUNTAINS OF SMOOTH UNDULATING FORMS
WHAT OTHER MARVELS DID THIS CAVERN CONTAIN
I FANCIED HIM RUNNING UNDER THE NOBLE TREES WHICH LINE THE ROAD TO ALTONA GESTICULATING MAKING SHOTS WITH HIS CANE THRASHING THE LONG GRASS CUTTING THE HEADS OFF THE THISTLES AND DISTURBING THE CONTEMPLATIVE STORKS IN THEIR PEACEFUL SOLITUDE
THIS FINE FELLOW MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED OF GREAT STRENGTH
AND WITH WHAT IS LEFT I WILL GIVE A GRAND DINNER TO MY FRIENDS AT THE JOHANNAEUM I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS
AT LAST I WRITE DOWN THE WORDS
WHAT WITH WALKING ON THE VERDANT SHORES OF THE BAY WITHIN WHICH NESTLES THE LITTLE TOWN EXPLORING THE THICK WOODS WHICH MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A NEST EMBOWERED AMONGST THICK FOLIAGE ADMIRING THE VILLAS EACH PROVIDED WITH A LITTLE BATHING HOUSE AND MOVING ABOUT AND GRUMBLING AT LAST TEN O'CLOCK CAME
WE SHALL PASS DOWN THE SOUND FULL SPEED WITH ALL SAILS SET IN A FEW MINUTES THE SCHOONER UNDER HER MIZEN BRIGANTINE TOPSAIL AND TOPGALLANT SAIL LOOSED FROM HER MOORINGS AND MADE FULL SAIL THROUGH THE STRAITS
I WAS A GOOD DEAL PUZZLED
SO GOOD BYE GOOD BYE AXEL AU REVOIR THESE WERE THE LAST WORDS I HEARD
I GAVE NOT A THOUGHT TO THE THINGS OF THE SURFACE OF THIS GLOBE INTO WHICH I HAD DIVED
WHEN I SAW MYSELF THUS FAR REMOVED FROM ALL EARTHLY HELP I HAD RECOURSE TO HEAVENLY SUCCOUR
MY UNCLE EXAMINED ALL HIS POCKETS AND HIS TRAVELLING BAG WITH THE MINUTEST CARE
AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE FIGURE OF HANS LIGHTED UP BY THE FIRE
I CANNOT DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
BE CALM AXEL
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY BOAT FIRST IT WILL NOT BE A BOAT AT ALL BUT A GOOD WELL-MADE RAFT WHY I SAID A RAFT WOULD BE JUST AS HARD TO MAKE AS A BOAT AND I DON'T SEE I KNOW YOU DON'T SEE
NOW AND THEN I FELT I OUGHT TO BREAK OUT INTO A PASSION BUT SHE TOOK NO NOTICE AND WENT ON HER WAY AS METHODICALLY AS EVER
I WILL LOOK
THIS CALCULATION COULD AT BEST BE BUT A VAGUE APPROXIMATION
WE WERE FOLLOWING A HORIZONTAL PLANE WHEN ONLY SIX PACES IN OUR PROGRESS WAS INTERRUPTED BY AN ENORMOUS BLOCK JUST ACROSS OUR WAY
THE FEW NOTES OF THE TRANSLATOR ARE LOCATED NEAR THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE REFERENCED
I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
FOR I HAVE NOT YET ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION AND YOUR INSTRUMENTS MUST BE ABLE TO FURNISH THE ANSWER HORIZONTALLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEAGUES FROM ICELAND SO MUCH AS THAT I AM SURE OF NOT BEING A MILE OUT OF MY RECKONING AND DOES THE COMPASS STILL SHOW SOUTH-EAST YES
WORDS OF HUMAN TONGUE ARE INADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE THE DISCOVERIES OF HIM WHO VENTURES INTO THE DEEP ABYSSES OF EARTH
TYPE
AN EVIL DESIGN WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM UP NOT DOWN
ON MY WAY I COULD HEAR MY UNCLE MURMURING
MY COUCH MADE UP OF ALL OUR TRAVELLING GEAR WAS IN A CHARMING GROTTO ADORNED WITH SPLENDID STALACTITES AND THE SOIL OF WHICH WAS A FINE SAND
I WAS LEFT ALONE
WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
NOW I WILL DICTATE TO YOU EVERY LETTER OF OUR ALPHABET WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH EACH OF THESE ICELANDIC CHARACTERS
FOUR
BUT AS THE COARSE AND HARD PLUMAGE OF THE MALE HAS NO COMMERCIAL VALUE THE HUNTER DOES NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO ROB THE NEST OF THIS
THE DARK PASSAGE WAS CUT OUT IN THE LIVE ROCK AND LINED WITH A COAT OF THE ERUPTIVE MATTER WHICH FORMERLY ISSUED FROM IT
THEREFORE THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT DURING THE STORM THERE HAD BEEN A SUDDEN CHANGE OF WIND UNPERCEIVED BY US WHICH HAD BROUGHT OUR RAFT BACK TO THE SHORE WHICH WE THOUGHT WE HAD LEFT SO LONG A DISTANCE BEHIND US
THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA A DEEP SILENCE FALLS ON ALL AROUND
STILL MY UNCLE REFUSED TO ADMIT AN APPEARANCE OF HESITATION EITHER BEFORE ME OR THE GUIDE
WAS IT THE FALL OF SOME MIGHTY PILLAR OF THE GLOBE
THEN AFTER THE TALK SUCCEEDED FOR ME AT ANY RATE A DISTURBED AND RESTLESS NIGHT
WHAT A NICE LITTLE WALK HE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION TO THE GUIDE WHO WITHOUT ANSWERING RESUMED HIS PLACE AT THE HEAD AND WENT ON HIS WAY
BUT HERE AS IF TO EXHIBIT AN EXAMPLE OF REGULARITY THOUGH IN ADVANCE OF THE VERY EARLIEST ARCHITECTS SHE HAS CREATED A SEVERELY SIMPLE ORDER OF ARCHITECTURE NEVER SURPASSED EITHER BY THE SPLENDOURS OF BABYLON OR THE WONDERS OF GREECE
OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM
THE SAIL STRETCHES TIGHT LIKE A BUBBLE READY TO BURST
THESE APPARITIONS WERE NOT CHEERFUL AND DID NOT THROW ANY CHARM OVER THE LESS AND LESS ATTRACTIVE LANDSCAPES
ALTHOUGH MY THIRST WAS ONLY PARTIALLY QUENCHED YET SOME STRENGTH HAD RETURNED
WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS
IT IS QUITE ABSURD I CRIED THERE IS NO SENSE ABOUT IT
THEN AN UNCONQUERABLE TERROR SEIZED UPON ME FROM WHICH I COULD NO LONGER GET FREE
I SURVEY THE WHOLE SPACE THAT STRETCHES OVERHEAD
PERHAPS I HAD BEEN CRYING OUT UNKNOWN TO MYSELF
WELL I WILL TELL YOU THAT TRUE SAVANTS AMONGST THEM POISSON HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IF A HEAT OF 360,000 DEGREES 1 EXISTED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE THE FIERY GASES ARISING FROM THE FUSED MATTER WOULD ACQUIRE AN ELASTIC FORCE WHICH THE CRUST OF THE EARTH WOULD BE UNABLE TO RESIST AND THAT IT WOULD EXPLODE LIKE THE PLATES OF A BURSTING BOILER THAT IS POISSON'S OPINION MY UNCLE NOTHING MORE GRANTED
IF THIS TORRENT HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED IN ITS FALL BY THE FORMATION OF THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN IT WOULD HAVE GONE ON TO THE SEA AND FORMED MORE ISLANDS
AND HE LAID OUT UPON THE TABLE A PIECE OF PARCHMENT FIVE INCHES BY THREE AND ALONG WHICH WERE TRACED CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS CHARACTERS
I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY OWN EYES
BUT AFTER FISHING HUNTING AND SHOEING HORSES FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME ONE SOON GETS INTO THE WAYS AND MANNERS OF FISHERMEN HUNTERS AND FARRIERS AND OTHER RATHER RUDE AND UNCULTIVATED PEOPLE
HIS RESTLESS EYES WERE IN INCESSANT MOTION BEHIND HIS FULL-SIZED SPECTACLES
WHEN I WAS ALONE I THOUGHT I WOULD GO AND TELL GRAEUBEN ALL ABOUT IT
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK IT MUST BE ENDLESS WHEN SUDDENLY AT SIX O'CLOCK A WALL VERY UNEXPECTEDLY STOOD BEFORE US
SUCH WAS THE GENTLEMAN WHO ADDRESSED ME IN THAT IMPETUOUS MANNER
TR WHAT IS THAT REASON I SAID RATHER ASTONISHED
BUT FOR HIM CARRIED AWAY BY MY DREAM I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
JULES VERNE HAS BEEN SO HAPPY IN WEAVING TOGETHER IN JUDICIOUS COMBINATION SEVERE SCIENTIFIC TRUTH WITH A CHARMING EXERCISE OF PLAYFUL IMAGINATION
I SAW THAT HIS POSITION ON THE OLD PARCHMENT WAS IMPREGNABLE
LONG MOANS ESCAPED FROM MY SWOLLEN LIPS
WHAT MONSTER CAN POSSIBLY FILL ITSELF WITH SUCH A QUANTITY OF WATER AND SPURT IT UP SO CONTINUOUSLY
AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE DURING WHICH I DARED NOT QUESTION HIM HE RESUMED
YOUR LIBRARY
BUT THEIR VERY BREVITY AND THEIR OBSCURITY REVEAL THE INTENSITY OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH DOMINATED ME AND DESCRIBE THE ACTUAL POSITION EVEN BETTER THAN MY MEMORY COULD DO SUNDAY 23.--WHERE ARE WE
I THEREFORE MADE FOR THE BANKS OF THE ELBE WHERE THE STEAMER LANDS HER PASSENGERS WHICH FORMS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE HAMBURG RAILWAY
UNSPEAKABLE DESPAIR THEN SEIZED UPON ME
COULD I HAVE DREAMED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE GONE OUT FOR A WALK INSTEAD OF HURRYING YOUR PREPARATIONS FORWARD ARE WE TO GO I ASKED AGAIN WITH SINKING HOPES
YOU WON'T GO BACK SHOULD I RENOUNCE THIS EXPEDITION JUST WHEN WE HAVE THE FAIREST CHANCE OF SUCCESS
THIS GOES ON AS LONG AS SHE HAS ANY DOWN LEFT
BUT DEAR GRAEUBEN WAS THERE
AT LAST AFTER THREE HOURS SAILING ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING WE REACHED A PLACE SUITABLE FOR OUR LANDING
URSA MINOR THEN I FELL FAST ASLEEP
WHERE TO I POINTED WITH MY FINGER DOWNWARD
CHAPTER XXIX
THE SAURIANS OF OUR DAY THE ALLIGATORS AND THE CROCODILES ARE BUT FEEBLE REPRODUCTIONS OF THEIR FOREFATHERS OF PRIMITIVE AGES
I CAUGHT THE SHADES OF THIS ICELANDER'S CHARACTER BY THE WAY IN WHICH HE LISTENED TO THE IMPASSIONED FLOW OF WORDS WHICH FELL FROM THE PROFESSOR
IN THE MEANTIME UP WE WENT
WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS
BUT THAT HAIR'S BREADTH CHANCE HAD GIVEN IT TO ME
HAPPILY WE WERE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND SHELTERED FROM ALL HARM
A BRIG AND TWO OR THREE SCHOONERS MIGHT HAVE MOORED WITHIN IT IN SAFETY
ALREADY WIDELY DISTURBED REGIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER INDICATE SOME COMMOTION BELOW
BUT I FELL FROM THE HEIGHT OF MY NEW-BORN HOPES WHEN MY UNCLE SAID
A MOUNTAIN RISING OUT OF THE SEA RIGHT
I NOTICE THAT IT THROWS UP ITS COLUMN OF WATER WITH VARIABLE FORCE
IT WAS NOT THE LIGHT OF THE SUN WITH HIS DAZZLING SHAFTS OF BRIGHTNESS AND THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS RAYS
AS LONG AS WE WERE PROTECTED ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDING STAIRCASE UP THE TOWER ALL WAS WELL ENOUGH
THEN THE ROLLING OF THUNDER WHICH HAD ROUSED ME FROM MY LETHARGY
COMING OUT FROM THE PRIEST'S HOUSE THE PROFESSOR TOOK A STRAIGHT ROAD WHICH THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE BASALTIC WALL LED AWAY FROM THE SEA
HE WAS SEIZED WITH THE MAL DE PAYS A COMPLAINT FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT EVEN A NAME IN ENGLISH
THESE ARE THE MOLAR TEETH OF THE DEINOTHERIUM
I WAITED A FEW MINUTES
I GAZED I THOUGHT I ADMIRED WITH A STUPEFACTION MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FEAR
BUT I COULD NOT BUT UNDERSTAND AND APPLAUD AND CHEER HIM ON WHEN I SAW HIM LAY HOLD OF THE PICKAXE TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON THE ROCK
IT HAS NOT TWISTED ITSELF OUT OF SHAPE
OUR STOCK OF ROPES AND LADDERS WAS REDUCED TO THE BIT OF CORD ROLLED ROUND THE STUMP OF THE MAST
ARE WE STILL UNDER THE SEA
YES THAT KEY CHANCE WHAT IS THAT YOU ARE SAYING HE SHOUTED WITH INDESCRIBABLE EMOTION
OUR HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW WHILST HE WENT ON TALKING MY UNCLE PREPARED A FEW PROVISIONS WHICH I DEVOURED EAGERLY NOTWITHSTANDING HIS ADVICE TO THE CONTRARY
WE WERE STILL FOLLOWING THE GALLERY OF LAVA A REAL NATURAL STAIRCASE AND AS GENTLY SLOPING AS THOSE INCLINED PLANES WHICH IN SOME OLD HOUSES ARE STILL FOUND INSTEAD OF FLIGHTS OF STEPS
BUT MY WEAKNESS PREVENTED ME FROM UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE VOICES SAID
HIS EYES WERE MOISTENED
ARE WE RISING INTO A FIERY FURNACE I CRIED AT ONE MOMENT WHEN THE HEAT WAS REDOUBLING
I PERCEIVED IN THE BROAD CLEARINGS LEFT BY FALLEN TREES DECAYED WITH AGE LEGUMINOSE PLANTS ACERINEAE RUBICEAE AND MANY OTHER EATABLE SHRUBS DEAR TO RUMINANT ANIMALS AT EVERY PERIOD
THE BLOOD OF A MINERALOGIST WAS IN MY VEINS AND IN THE MIDST OF MY SPECIMENS I WAS ALWAYS HAPPY
OH MY UNCLE BURST FROM MY LIPS IN THE TONE OF DESPAIR
MY UNCLE TO HIS OWN INTENSE DISGUST AND HIS GREATER SHAME WAS ILL ALL THROUGH THE VOYAGE
MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE
IS THE WIND FAVOURABLE MY UNCLE ASKED
THE YET ELASTIC AND YIELDING CRUST OF THE EARTH OBEYED THE FLUID FORCES BENEATH
IN THE FOURTH LINE APPEARED THE WORD LUCO WHICH MEANS A SACRED WOOD
HANS AND MY UNCLE CLINGING TO THE WALL TRIED TO NIBBLE A FEW BITS OF BISCUIT
EXPLAIN IT IS AN ERUPTION AXEL AN ERUPTION
WITH THIS PERSUASION I WAS HURRYING AWAY TO MY OWN LITTLE RETREAT UPSTAIRS WHEN THE STREET DOOR CREAKED UPON ITS HINGES
AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH
TRANS THE MAST YET HOLDS FIRM
THE JAWS WHICH THEY ARM MUST BE POSSESSED OF AMAZING STRENGTH
BUT ARE YOUR OBSERVATIONS SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO ENABLE YOU TO DO THIS CORRECTLY YES
FARTHER ON THE PACHYDERMATOUS LOPHIODON CRESTED TOOTHED A GIGANTIC TAPIR HIDES BEHIND THE ROCKS TO DISPUTE ITS PREY WITH THE ANOPLOTHERIUM UNARMED BEAST A STRANGE CREATURE WHICH SEEMED A COMPOUND OF HORSE RHINOCEROS CAMEL AND HIPPOPOTAMUS
BESIDES IN OUR STATE OF DESTITUTION AND FAMINE WE WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE PARTICULAR
THE COMPASS HAD LOST ITS PROPERTIES
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED UNDER THIS TERRESTRIAL CRUST AN OCEAN WITH EBBING AND FLOWING TIDES WITH WINDS AND STORMS WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE IS THERE ANY SCIENTIFIC REASON AGAINST IT NO
BUT FOR MY PART I PREFER THE MORE ORDINARY MODES OF HORIZONTAL PROGRESSION
THOSE ARE WORDS EVEN A FEW FEET FROM THE WALL I COULD HEAR DISTINCTLY
EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT
AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME
I WANTED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD SAVED AND WITH THE LANTERN IN MY HAND I BEGAN MY EXAMINATION
I CAME OUT OF MY UNCLE'S STUDY AS IF I HAD BEEN STUNNED AND AS IF THERE WAS NOT AIR ENOUGH IN ALL THE STREETS OF HAMBURG TO PUT ME RIGHT AGAIN
AT THAT MOMENT MY UNCLE WAS SOLEMNLY INVESTING GRAEUBEN WITH THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT
BUT IS IT NOT ALSO A MENAGERIE SURELY NOT A MENAGERIE YES
MY UNCLE WENT AHEAD WITH A LIGHT STEP
WERE WE TO REACH A DEPTH OF THIRTY MILES WE SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AT THE LIMIT OF THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST FOR THERE THE TEMPERATURE WILL BE MORE THAN 2372 DEGREES ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING PUT INTO A STATE OF FUSION I WILL LEAVE YOU TO DECIDE THAT QUESTION I ANSWERED RATHER SULLENLY
THE GUIDE WATCHED THIS SCENE WITH HIS USUAL PHLEGMATIC UNCONCERN
I MADE A WISE RESOLVE TO WALK TWICE ROUND THE ROOM QUIETLY AND SETTLE MY NERVES AND THEN I RETURNED INTO THE DEEP GULF OF THE HUGE ARMCHAIR
NO VIOLENCE ACCOMPANIED THIS CHANGE
AND STRANGE TO SAY THE THOUGHT CAME ACROSS ME THAT WHEN SOME DAY MY PETRIFIED REMAINS SHOULD BE FOUND THIRTY LEAGUES BELOW THE SURFACE IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THE DISCOVERY MIGHT LEAD TO GRAVE SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS
GO MY DEAR AXEL GO
I NODDED MY HEAD UP AND DOWN
MY UNCLE HAS DRAWN NEARER TO ME
NO STEAM VENTS NO HOT SPRINGS SURROUND IT AND ALL THE VOLCANIC POWER OF THE REGION IS CONCENTRATED HERE
I LEARNED AFTERWARDS THAT HE AND THE GOVERNOR DISAGREED UPON SOME QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATION AND DID NOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER
THERE WAS ONE THING I MUST KNOW TO BEGIN WITH
WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT
CHAPTER XXI
HE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
DON'T YOU SEE IT YET
HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH A SECTION OF WALES OF WHICH AN ANCIENT PEOPLE GAVE ITS NAME TO THIS SYSTEM
NOW WE SHALL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN
MY UNCLE ENJOYED DURING HIS LIFETIME THE GLORY HE HAD DESERVEDLY WON
BUT THE HEATED AIR AND THE SENSATION OF BURNING LEFT ME NO ROOM FOR DOUBT
WE BREAKFASTED AND DRANK OF THIS EXCELLENT CHALYBEATE WATER
HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH GLOOMY RESOLUTIONS AGAINST IMPOSSIBILITIES
THIS SEEMED TO JUSTIFY MY FEARS
BY SIX IN THE EVENING AFTER A NOT VERY FATIGUING WALK WE HAD GONE TWO LEAGUES SOUTH BUT SCARCELY A QUARTER OF A MILE DOWN
WHEN YOU ARE NOT THE TIMIDEST YOU ARE THE BRAVEST OF CREATURES
I FELT MELANCHOLY UNDER THIS SAVAGE ASPECT OF NATURE AND MY THOUGHTS WENT AWAY TO THE CHEERFUL SCENES I HAD LEFT IN THE FAR SOUTH
THERE WERE TALL GRASSES FERNS LYCOPODS BESIDES SIGILLARIA ASTEROPHYLLITES NOW SCARCE PLANTS BUT THEN THE SPECIES MIGHT BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS
SOMETHING SERIOUS IS GOING TO HAPPEN SAID THE SERVANT SHAKING HER HEAD
I TOO WILL INSCRIBE MY NAME UPON THIS DARK GRANITE PAGE
THIS WAS THE APPEARANCE OF A DIRTY SLIP OF PARCHMENT WHICH SLIPPED OUT OF THE VOLUME AND FELL UPON THE FLOOR
THREE HOURS FATIGUING MARCH HAD ONLY BROUGHT US TO THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN
HE MET WITH THAT POINT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TUNNEL AT THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE WEIGHT OF BODIES DIMINISHES AS FAST AS WE DESCEND
THE WHOLE WASHED DOWN WITH SWEET MOSELLE
CONTENTS I THE PROFESSOR AND HIS FAMILY II A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE III THE RUNIC WRITING EXERCISES THE PROFESSOR IV THE ENEMY TO BE STARVED INTO SUBMISSION V FAMINE THEN VICTORY FOLLOWED BY DISMAY VI EXCITING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AN UNPARALLELED EXERCISE VII A WOMAN'S COURAGE VIII SERIOUS PREPARATIONS FOR VERTICAL DESCENT IX ICELAND BUT WHAT NEXT
YET IF AT OUR PRESENT DISTANCE FROM THE ANIMAL A DISTANCE OF TWELVE LEAGUES AT THE LEAST THE COLUMN OF WATER DRIVEN THROUGH ITS BLOWERS MAY BE DISTINCTLY SEEN IT MUST NEEDS BE OF VAST SIZE
THEY MADE DISCOVERIES AT WHICH WE ARE ASTONISHED
IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY THE SECRET WAS SACREDLY KEPT FROM THE EXCELLENT CURATOR
THOSE THAT COULD NOT SPEAK MADE UP FOR THAT WANT BY SHRILL CRIES
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF A JOURNEY TO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH BY JULES VERNE
HANS WAS FINISHING OUR PACKING ALMOST AS IT WERE WITHOUT MOVING A LIMB
BUT THERE IS A SECRET IN IT AND I MEAN TO DISCOVER THE KEY A VIOLENT GESTURE FINISHED THE SENTENCE
NO I SAID
MY DEAR NEPHEW SAID MY UNCLE PRESSING ME TO HIS BREAST YOU ARE SAVED I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED WITH THE TENDERNESS OF HIS MANNER AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS AND STILL MORE WITH THE CARE WITH WHICH HE WATCHED OVER ME
IS MASTER MAD SHE ASKED
THIS IS THE CELEBRATED EIDER DOWN AND IT REQUIRES NO GREAT RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENT TO GET IT
HANS WITH PERFECT COOLNESS RESUMED THE LEAD AND I FOLLOWED HIM WITHOUT A WORD
NOW THOUGHT I HERE WE ARE ABOUT TO CLIMB SNAEFELL
SPLENDID
BUT THIS WORK DID NOT SUCCEED IN ABSORBING ALL MY ATTENTION
AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME REFRESHED AND THANKFUL WE ALL THREE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP
PEOPLE REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE HIM ANY THE MORE
IT WAS ONE CALCULATED TO SHAKE FIRMER NERVES THAN MINE
YES REPLIED MY UNCLE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
BUT WHERE WAS THIS WATER FROM
WHITHER IS IT CARRYING ME
SO THE SOUND TAKES TWENTY SECONDS IN COMING
TO BE SURE IT WAS A WEEK-DAY
THERE WERE BUT FEW TREES
AND MASSIVE PILLARS STANDING OUT FROM THE WALL BENT UNDER THE SPRING OF THE VAULT THAT RESTED HEAVILY UPON THEM
WE HAD YET A TORCH LEFT BUT WE COULD NOT HAVE KEPT IT ALIGHT
WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE THE SAME WITH THE INTERNAL HEAT
I SHALL THEREFORE REPRODUCE HERE THESE DAILY NOTES WRITTEN SO TO SPEAK AS THE COURSE OF EVENTS DIRECTED IN ORDER TO FURNISH AN EXACT NARRATIVE OF OUR PASSAGE
COMMENT APPELLET-ON CETTE MONTAGNE MON ENFANT SILENCE STILL
HE LIVES
YOU SEE ALL THESE VOLUMES OF STEAM AXEL
THE LIMIT OF INTENSE LOUDNESS HAS BEEN PASSED WITHIN WHICH THE HUMAN EAR CAN DISTINGUISH ONE SOUND FROM ANOTHER
HANS QUIETLY MODERATELY MASTICATING HIS SMALL MOUTHFULS WITHOUT ANY NOISE AND RELISHING THEM WITH THE CALMNESS OF A MAN ABOVE ALL ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
BESIDES HE DID NOT ASK ME AND HE WENT ON TALKING TO HIMSELF
BUT MY UNCLE WHO WANTED NO RECRUITING WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE HAD TO BESTRIDE OUR BEASTS AGAIN
A DIM VAGUE NOTION LAID HOLD OF MY MIND BUT WHICH WAS FAST HARDENING INTO CERTAINTY
WE ARE MOUNTING AT A SPEED WHICH SEEMS TO ME OF FOURTEEN FEET IN A SECOND OR TEN MILES AN HOUR
LOOK AT THIS VERY WELL SAID HE QUIETLY IT IS THE SHELL OF A CRUSTACEAN OF AN EXTINCT SPECIES CALLED A TRILOBITE
NO I SAID NO
COME SAID HE THE VERY FIRST IDEA WHICH WOULD COME INTO ANY ONE'S HEAD TO CONFUSE THE LETTERS OF A SENTENCE WOULD BE TO WRITE THE WORDS VERTICALLY INSTEAD OF HORIZONTALLY INDEED SAID I
FRIDRIKSSEN WAS NOT THERE
YES AXEL A JOURNEY WORTHY OF THE NEPHEW OF A SAVANT
NOT AN ANIMAL BUT A FEW WANDERING PONIES THAT THEIR OWNERS WOULD NOT FEED
HANS AS A CAUTIOUS MAN HAD ADDED TO OUR LUGGAGE A LEATHERN BOTTLE FULL OF WATER WHICH WITH THAT IN OUR FLASKS WOULD ENSURE US A SUPPLY OF WATER FOR EIGHT DAYS
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE WAS NOT UNDESERVING OF HIS PUNISHMENT
SIT THERE AND WRITE I WAS SEATED IN A TRICE
I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED THE BED OF SURTURBRAND OUR FAITHFUL HANSBACH AND THE GROTTO IN WHICH I HAD RECOVERED LIFE AND CONSCIOUSNESS
BENEATH DOWN A PRETTY STEEP DECLIVITY RAN STREAMS OF LAVA FOR EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED FEET GIVING THE MOUNTAIN A HEIGHT OF ABOUT 1,300 OR 1,400 FEET
WERE WE UNDER ICELAND AGAIN
YES RETURN WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A MINUTE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED
THE PASSAGE WAS MARKED BY NOTHING UNUSUAL
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SIX FEET AT THE LEAST
NOTHING COULD BE MORE APROPOS
THERE IS NO CHANGE IN ITS ASPECT
AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT THE JOURNEY COMMENCES SO SAYING MY UNCLE TOOK IN ONE HAND RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH WAS HANGING FROM HIS NECK
PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
THE PROFESSOR AT LAST EMERGED FROM HIS CABIN RATHER PALE AND WRETCHED-LOOKING BUT STILL FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND WITH ARDENT SATISFACTION SHINING IN HIS EYES
KYRKOHERDE SAID HANS TURNING ROUND TO MY UNCLE
AND NOW UNCLE TELL ME WHERE WE ARE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TO-MORROW AXEL TO-MORROW
NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THESE POOR PRIESTS WHO AFTER ALL ARE VERY WRETCHED
EVIDENTLY SAID I WE HAVE NOT LANDED AGAIN AT OUR ORIGINAL STARTING POINT BUT THE STORM HAS CARRIED US A LITTLE HIGHER AND IF WE FOLLOW THE SHORE WE SHALL FIND PORT GRAEUBEN IF THAT IS THE CASE IT WILL BE USELESS TO CONTINUE OUR EXPLORATION AND WE HAD BETTER RETURN TO OUR RAFT
BUT THERE WAS ONE DEAD FLY AMIDST ALL THIS GLORY AND HONOUR
IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
IT IS QUITE PLAIN SAID I THAT THE HIGHER BODY OF THIS WATER IS AT A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION
HE THEREFORE SPOKE TO THE HUNTER WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD SAYING
THE WATER HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE GULF
AND IT WAS A REAL EXERCISE OF THE SENSE OF HEARING
UNTIL NOW PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF NON-CONDUCTING ROCKS ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM HAD TEMPERED THE LAWS OF NATURE GIVING US ONLY A MODERATELY WARM CLIMATE FOR THE THEORY OF A CENTRAL FIRE REMAINED IN MY ESTIMATION THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS TRUE AND EXPLICABLE
CHRONOMETER 8.17 A.M
THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT
THE UNFORESEEN NATURE OF THIS SPECTACLE BROUGHT BACK THE COLOUR TO MY CHEEKS
NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY HANS SUCCEEDED IN LIGHTING THE TORCH
THE ROARINGS SEEM TO PROCEED FROM A VERY DISTANT WATERFALL
NATURE HERSELF WAS TOO SLOW FOR HIM
WHERE'S THE KEY OF MY CARPET BAG
I HEARD TOO A VAGUE AND INDISTINCT NOISE SOMETHING LIKE THE MURMURING OF WAVES BREAKING UPON A SHINGLY SHORE AND AT TIMES I SEEMED TO HEAR THE WHISTLING OF WIND
I COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS ATTENTION TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
GRAEUBEN FOLLOWED ME
NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR
FOR MY PART I COULD FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO HAVE FORGOTTEN MY HUNGER AND MY FATIGUE TO ENJOY THE LOVELY SCENE BEFORE ME
I FELT WEIGHED DOWN AND I EXHAUSTED MYSELF WITH IMAGINARY VIOLENT EXERTIONS TO TURN ROUND UPON MY GRANITE COUCH
SUDDENLY TURNING ROUND I OBSERVED THAT I WAS ALONE
MY BOY WHERE ARE YOU LOST IN THE DEEPEST DARKNESS WHERE IS YOUR LAMP IT IS OUT AND THE STREAM DISAPPEARED AXEL AXEL TAKE COURAGE WAIT
I TRIED TO RECOGNISE MY WAY BY THE FORM OF THE TUNNEL BY THE PROJECTIONS OF CERTAIN ROCKS BY THE DISPOSITION OF THE FRACTURES
THIRTY LEAGUES OF ROCK SEEMED TO WEIGH UPON MY SHOULDERS WITH A DREADFUL PRESSURE
ARE YOU NOT THINKING OF RETURNING TO THE SURFACE NOW RETURN
THERE READ THAT I SAID PRESENTING A SHEET OF PAPER ON WHICH I HAD WRITTEN
YET AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO LETTERS ENGRAVED ON THIS SPOT THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO I STOOD AGHAST IN DUMB AMAZEMENT
WE SEEMED TO BE CHANTING IN CHORUS
1 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
NEVER HAD BOTANIST SUCH A FEAST AS THIS YOU ARE RIGHT MY UNCLE
SINCE OUR DEPARTURE FROM PORT GRAEUBEN PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD ENTRUSTED THE LOG TO MY CARE
THE KITCHEN WAS ALSO A DINING-ROOM
FROM THAT TIME THE SCHOONER TOOK A WIDE BERTH AND SWEPT AT A GREAT DISTANCE ROUND CAPE REJKIANESS WHICH FORMS THE WESTERN POINT OF ICELAND
IS THE OCEAN SPREAD ABOVE OUR HEADS OF COURSE AXEL
BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE TO SLAKE OUR THIRST
THE SCIENTIFIC PORTION OF THE FRENCH ORIGINAL IS NOT WITHOUT A FEW ERRORS WHICH THE TRANSLATOR WITH THE KIND ASSISTANCE OF MR CAMERON OF H
STILL I THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
THERE IT IS
IF IT HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN A PASSAGE FOR ERUPTIVE MATTER THROWN OUT BY SNAEFELL I STILL COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY NO TRACE WAS LEFT OF ITS PASSAGE
NOTHING IN SIGHT BEFORE US
FRIDRIKSSEN WANTED TO KNOW WHAT SUCCESS MY UNCLE HAD HAD AT THE LIBRARY
THEN CALMLY AUTOMATICALLY AND DISPASSIONATELY HE KISSED THE HOST THE HOSTESS AND THEIR NINETEEN CHILDREN
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE MADE NO GREAT PROGRESS VERTICALLY WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT BECAUSE IF WE HAD GONE DEEP INTO THE CRUST OF EARTH WE SHOULD HAVE ENCOUNTERED GREATER HEAT ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
I WAS SUFFOCATING
THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH
THIS JUSTIFIED DAVY'S THEORY AND MORE THAN ONCE I CONSULTED THE THERMOMETER WITH SURPRISE
THOUGH FAR AWAY IN THE REMOTEST NORTH HE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY THOSE WHOSE LIVES HE PROTECTED AND CERTAINLY I SHALL NOT FAIL TO ENDEAVOUR TO SEE HIM ONCE MORE BEFORE I DIE
ONE BIT OF SALT MEAT FOR THE THREE MY UNCLE STARED AT ME AS IF HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
SURELY THIS OCEAN IS WELL PEOPLED WITH FISH FOR IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS WE TOOK A LARGE QUANTITY OF PTERICHTHYDES AS WELL AS OF OTHERS BELONGING TO THE EXTINCT FAMILY OF THE DIPTERIDES BUT OF WHICH MY UNCLE COULD NOT TELL THE SPECIES
BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF
AT A GLANCE I COULD TELL THE WHOLE SECRET
AS I HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF OUR MANOEUVRES WITH THE ROPE WHICH I KNEW THAT WE HAD REPEATED FOURTEEN TIMES EACH DESCENT OCCUPYING HALF AN HOUR THE CONCLUSION WAS EASY THAT WE HAD BEEN SEVEN HOURS PLUS FOURTEEN QUARTERS OF REST MAKING TEN HOURS AND A HALF
STILL THE APPEARANCE OF HANS AND SUNDRY PIECES OF INTELLIGENCE DERIVED FROM ICELAND TENDED TO SHAKE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE UNBELIEVERS
SUCH WAS ITS DIFFUSIVENESS THERE BEING NO CENTRAL POINT FROM WHICH THE LIGHT EMANATED THAT SHADOWS NO LONGER EXISTED
HANS HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE HALT TO REFIT HIS RUDDER
THERE WE WERE TRANSFERRED FROM THE BOAT TO ANOTHER LINE OF RAILWAY WHICH TOOK US BY JUST AS FLAT A COUNTRY AS THE PLAIN OF HOLSTEIN
BUT OBEYING AN IMPULSE FROM HIGHER CURRENTS THEIR DENSE CONSISTENCY SLOWLY YIELDS
HE FEASTED HIS EYES UPON M
HERE MY NOTES BECOME VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
HE HAD WATER AND FIRE AT HIS DISPOSAL SO THAT HE WAS ABLE TO VARY OUR BILL OF FARE NOW AND THEN
HE NEVER MAKES A FALSE STEP NEVER SHIES
AND WHAT WAS THE USE OF SAYING FACETIOUS THINGS AT A TIME LIKE THIS
AT THE AGE OF THE WORLD WHICH PRECEDED THE SECONDARY PERIOD THE EARTH WAS CLOTHED WITH IMMENSE VEGETABLE FORMS THE PRODUCT OF THE DOUBLE INFLUENCE OF TROPICAL HEAT AND CONSTANT MOISTURE
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL
BUT HANS IS AS USUAL
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS HERE INTENSIFIED A HUNDREDFOLD BY REFLECTION
ANOTHER REMARKABLE THING
THEN THIS UNBEARABLE HEAT THIS BOILING WATER
SOON AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS THE BOGGY LAND REAPPEARED INTERSECTED BY LITTLE LAKES
BUT IT WAS NOT SO
BUT IT WAS NOT SO
HE LIVED IN HIS OWN LITTLE HOUSE IN KOENIGSTRASSE A STRUCTURE HALF BRICK AND HALF WOOD WITH A GABLE CUT INTO STEPS
I GAZED UPON THESE WONDERS IN SILENCE
THE TWO BEASTS ARE FAST LOCKED TOGETHER
THEN I REMEMBERED THE THEORY OF AN ENGLISH CAPTAIN WHO LIKENED THE EARTH TO A VAST HOLLOW SPHERE IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS BECAUSE OF THE VAST PRESSURE THAT WEIGHED UPON IT
SEVERAL SAVANTS OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE AND AMONGST THEM MM
I FOLLOWED AND PRESENTLY WE WERE TREADING THE SOIL OF ICELAND
WELL THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF A VOLCANIC ERUPTION AM I TO BELIEVE THAT I CRIED
EVERYWHERE BARE ROCKS SIGNS OF VOLCANIC ACTION
WE HAD LONG LOST SIGHT OF THE SEA SHORE BEHIND THE HILLS OF BONES
THE VISITORS ROOM SEEMED TO ME THE WORST IN THE WHOLE CABIN
THE SAIL I CRY MOTIONING TO LOWER IT
WE SHALL SEE IT NO MORE I SAID WITH A SIGH
THE WIND HAS RISEN AND HAS RAPIDLY CARRIED US AWAY FROM AXEL ISLAND
WAS I TO BELIEVE HIM IN EARNEST IN HIS INTENTION TO PENETRATE TO THE CENTRE OF THIS MASSIVE GLOBE
BUT FOR EVER HENCEFORTH LET THIS CAPE THAT ADVANCES INTO THE SEA DISCOVERED BY YOURSELF BE KNOWN BY YOUR OWN ILLUSTRIOUS NAME--CAPE SAKNUSSEMM SUCH WERE THE GLOWING WORDS OF PANEGYRIC WHICH FELL UPON MY ATTENTIVE EAR AND I COULD NOT RESIST THE SENTIMENT OF ENTHUSIASM WITH WHICH I TOO WAS INFECTED
AND THE FLAME PRESERVING ITS UPWARD TENDENCY THREW ENOUGH LIGHT TO SHOW US WHAT KIND OF A PLACE WE WERE IN
I FREELY CONFESS THAT I WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF GEOLOGY AND ALL ITS KINDRED SCIENCES
THE ROUGH SEA PREVENTED MY UNCLE FROM COMING ON DECK TO ADMIRE THESE SHATTERED AND SURF-BEATEN COASTS
HANS MERELY NODDED
NO DOUBT UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF INTENSE PAIN EVERYBODY BECOMES ENDOWED WITH THE GIFT OF DIVERS TONGUES
WHEN I HAVE ADDED TO COMPLETE MY PORTRAIT THAT MY UNCLE WALKED BY MATHEMATICAL STRIDES OF A YARD AND A HALF AND THAT IN WALKING HE KEPT HIS FISTS FIRMLY CLOSED A SURE SIGN OF AN IRRITABLE TEMPERAMENT I THINK I SHALL HAVE SAID ENOUGH TO DISENCHANT ANY ONE WHO SHOULD BY MISTAKE HAVE COVETED MUCH OF HIS COMPANY
THE PILE AND COIL ARE PLACED IN A LEATHERN BAG WHICH THE TRAVELLER CARRIES OVER HIS SHOULDERS
BUT I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BASALTIC FORMATION
MY UNCLE PAID WITHOUT A REMARK
WHILST YOU WERE LYING THERE MOTIONLESS I WENT TO EXAMINE THE CONFORMATION OF THAT GALLERY
I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK
THE MANNER OF OUR LOCOMOTION LEFT NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
BUT DO LET ME EXHAUST ALL THE POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS AGAINST THIS DOCUMENT SPEAK MY BOY DON'T BE AFRAID
I THEREFORE KNEW NOT A SINGLE WORD OF ALL THAT WAS SAID AT THIS SEMI-OFFICIAL DINNER
THIS BENEFICENT SPRING AFTER HAVING SATISFIED OUR THIRST ON THE ROAD WOULD NOW BE MY GUIDE AMONG THE WINDINGS OF THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST
BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION IN WHAT DIRECTION WE HAVE BEEN MOVING
I WILL NOT SPEAK OF THE SUFFERINGS WE ENDURED IN OUR RETURN
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE MISTAKEN
HE WAS MODEST NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GLORY AND HE WAS ALL THE MORE FAMOUS FOR HIS HUMILITY
THEREFORE WE MUST GET TO COPENHAGEN AS FAST AS WE CAN TO SECURE OUR PASSAGE
THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES
SO LET IT BE
HE WOULD INSIST UPON DOING IT TOO
NO OPENING
AY FIRE I INSTANTLY PLUNGED THE END OF THE FUSE INTO THE LANTERN
HE WAS TRANSFORMED
OVER THE DIMLY LIGHTED STRAND THERE TROD THE HUGE MAMMALS OF THE FIRST AGES OF THE WORLD THE LEPTOTHERIUM SLENDER BEAST FOUND IN THE CAVERNS OF BRAZIL
FALCONER BUSK CARPENTER AND OTHERS--SCIENTIFIC GERMANS WERE SOON JOINED AND AMONGST THEM THE FORWARDEST THE MOST FIERY AND THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC WAS MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK
MY UNCLE WAS AT TABLE DEVOURING HIS BREAKFAST
UPON MY HONOUR I COULD NOT HAVE ENLIGHTENED HIM
NO HE HAD NOT THE ANEROID AND NO GUESSING COULD SUPPLY ITS PLACE
IS NOT THE RAFT SPINNING ALONG WITH MARVELLOUS SPEED
III
THEY HEAVED AROUND THEM LIQUID MOUNTAINS WHICH ROLLED EVEN TO OUR RAFT AND ROCKED IT PERILOUSLY
OUR PROVISIONS WERE REDUCED TO ONE BIT OF SALT MEAT AND A FEW BISCUITS
FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS
BUT IF THERE WAS NO WANT OF STEPS STILL THERE WAS NO RAIL
YELLOW CAME OUT BEST
THE NEXT DAY JUNE 23 HANS WAS AWAITING US WITH HIS COMPANIONS CARRYING PROVISIONS TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS
FRIDRIKSSEN WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH NOT TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT WHEN HE HAD NOTICED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HIS FRIEND
HOW OFTEN THIS OPERATION WAS REPEATED I CANNOT SAY
TAKE YOUR COMPASS AND NOTE THE DIRECTION I LOOKED AND REPLIED CAREFULLY
LISTEN TO ME
THE SOUND HE CRIED
HASTIGT CRIED OUR GUIDE
I FANCY I SEE A LIVING CREATURE SIMILAR TO OURSELVES
WELL THEN I SAID I AM FORCED TO ADMIT THAT SAKNUSSEMM'S SENTENCE IS CLEAR AND LEAVES NO ROOM FOR DOUBT
THE LAVA WHICH WAS POROUS IN MANY PLACES HAD FORMED A SURFACE COVERED WITH SMALL ROUNDED BLISTERS
I WAS FORCED TO CONFESS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ARCTIC HERE
HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE
XLIV SUNNY LANDS IN THE BLUE MEDITERRANEAN XLV ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
I PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS
BY DEGREES THEY DILATE AND GAIN IN HUGE SIZE WHAT THEY LOSE IN NUMBER
IT IS RATHER A HEAVY WEIGHT TO BEAR BUT A SOLID ARCH SPANS OVER OUR HEADS
HE CAME TO PROFFER ME HIS GOOD OFFICES IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE AND I FELT THAT WE WERE MADE TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
AT A CERTAIN PERIOD THE EARTH CONSISTED ONLY OF AN ELASTIC CRUST OR BARK ALTERNATELY ACTED ON BY FORCES FROM ABOVE OR BELOW ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION AND GRAVITATION
FRIDRIKSSEN TREATED ME TO A LINE OF VIRGIL EMINENTLY APPLICABLE TO SUCH UNCERTAIN WANDERERS AS WE WERE LIKELY TO BE
HANS MUST BE MISTAKEN I SAID RAISING MYSELF UP
ARE WE REALLY GOING OF COURSE YOU UNHAPPY BOY
THEY CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT BEING FELT
AMONGST THEM ALL SCARTARIS LAID DOWN HIS SHARP-POINTED ANGULAR SHADOW WHICH BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT OF THE RADIANT ORB
AND HE CAME RECOMMENDED BY M
SEE HERE ARE RECENT FISSURES GROOVING AND CHANNELLING THE GRANITE ROOF
JUST AS I THOUGHT SAID THE PROFESSOR WE ARE IN A TUNNEL NOT FOUR-AND-TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER
AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED TO ME JUDGING FROM HIS FINGERS WHICH WERE BEGINNING TO WORK WITH TERRIBLE ENERGY
YOU MAY BE SURE I FELT STIRRED UP
AT LAST SUPPOSING YOU WERE STILL ON THE HANSBACH WE FIRED OUR GUNS
NO NOISE OF CART WHEELS NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING NO DOUBT IT IS VERY QUIET AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS WELL BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ALARMING IN THE QUIETNESS ITSELF NOW COME MY UNCLE CRIED
AS FOR THE PROFESSOR'S REFLECTIONS THEY WENT FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE SWIFTEST EXPRESS
WHAT AN EFFECT THIS UNEXPECTED NAME PRODUCED UPON MY MIND
IT WAS A WIDE GALLERY
FROM TIME TO TIME A STEEPER PATH APPEARED
HERE IS A SERIES OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO LETTERS IN APPARENT DISORDER
WE WERE AT THE END OF A BLIND ALLEY
I REMEMBER THAT A SIMILAR PHENOMENON HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY PLACES
WE CLUTCHED EACH OTHER FAST TO SAVE OURSELVES FROM BEING THROWN OFF THE RAFT
WHERE DID TRUTH STOP
IT WAS LIKE THE DISTANT RUMBLE OF CONTINUOUS THUNDER AND I COULD HEAR ITS SOUNDING UNDULATIONS ROLLING FAR AWAY INTO THE REMOTE RECESSES OF THE ABYSS
HE FOUGHT WITH WILFUL WORDS THAT REFUSED TO PASS HIS STRUGGLING LIPS SUCH WORDS AS RESIST AND DISTEND THE CHEEKS AND AT LAST BREAK OUT INTO THE UNASKED-FOR SHAPE OF A ROUND AND MOST UNSCIENTIFIC OATH
WE SHALL SEE FURTHER PROOF OF THAT VERY SOON NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
ON THAT DAY THE TUNNEL WENT DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE
I WAS YET IN HOPES THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MEANS OF GETTING TO ICELAND
TWENTY TIMES NAY A HUNDRED TIMES HAVE I FOUGHT AGAINST A FRIGHTFUL IMPULSE TO DRINK IT OFF
HAVE YOU OBSERVED HOW INTENSE SOUND IS DOWN HERE NO DOUBT IT IS
COME AXEL COME YOU MISERABLE WRETCH MY UNCLE CRIED FROM AS FAR OFF AS HE COULD SEE ME
A WORK HOWEVER WHICH FAILED TO COVER ITS EXPENSES
NOW THIS IS MY PROPOSAL
WE PASSED LEAN PASTURES WHICH WERE TRYING VERY HARD BUT IN VAIN TO LOOK GREEN
NOW AT THE RATE OF 1,120 FEET IN A SECOND THIS IS 22,400 FEET OR FOUR MILES AND A QUARTER NEARLY FOUR MILES AND A QUARTER I MURMURED
HIS TEACHING WAS AS THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHY CALLS IT SUBJECTIVE
WHAT CAN BE MORE NATURAL
HANS STOPPED WHERE THE TORRENT SEEMED CLOSEST
HE WAS PANTING RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER GESTICULATING AND UTTERING INCOHERENT EXPRESSIONS
WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN IT OUT
MY DAZZLED EYES WERE BATHED IN THE BRIGHT FLOOD OF THE SOLAR RAYS
YES HE SAID A DRAUGHT OF WATER
ON THE 26TH NOTHING YET
STILL I HAD COURAGEOUSLY SHOULDERED MY BURDEN AGAIN AND WAS RAPIDLY FOLLOWING HANS WHOM MY UNCLE PRECEDED
THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
SOMETIMES THE AIR WOULD CUT OUR BREATH SHORT AS IS EXPERIENCED BY AERONAUTS ASCENDING TOO RAPIDLY
FOR THE END OF EACH LOCK OF LOOSE FLOWING HAIR IS TIPPED WITH LITTLE LUMINOUS RADIATIONS
IT'S ALL OVER THE LAST THING I SAW WAS A FEARFUL GESTURE OF RAGE AND MY EYES CLOSED
THERE ARE NO MORE SEASONS
IN THIS DOCUMENT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO LETTERS VIZ SEVENTY-SEVEN CONSONANTS AND FIFTY-FIVE VOWELS
THIS WAS NOT A LARGE PARCEL BUT IT WAS COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT OF ESSENCE OF BEEF AND BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX MONTHS CONSUMPTION
THE DEVONIAN SEAS WERE PEOPLED BY ANIMALS OF THESE SPECIES AND DEPOSITED THEM BY THOUSANDS IN THE ROCKS OF THE NEWER FORMATION
SINCE HISTORIC TIMES THERE HAS BEEN BUT ONE ERUPTION OF THIS MOUNTAIN THAT OF 1219
I WONDERED WHETHER I WAS AWAKE WHETHER I WAS DREAMING WHETHER MY BRAIN CRAZED BY MY FALL WAS NOT AFFECTED BY IMAGINARY NOISES
GOOD SAID THE PROFESSOR WITHOUT READING THEM NOW SET DOWN THOSE WORDS IN A HORIZONTAL LINE I OBEYED AND WITH THIS RESULT
THE PLESIOSAURUS A SERPENT WITH A CYLINDRICAL BODY AND A SHORT TAIL HAS FOUR FLAPPERS OR PADDLES TO ACT LIKE OARS
MY UNCLE BENDING OVER HIS TASK NOTICED NOTHING NOT EVEN MARTHA HALF OPENING THE DOOR
HANS HAD SAVED ME FROM DEATH WHILST I LAY ROLLING ON THE EDGE OF THE CRATER
WE STOOD PETRIFIED AND SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT
WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
THE COMMONEST PRUDENCE WOULD COUNSEL IMMEDIATE FLIGHT
THIS MODEST PHILOSOPHER SPOKE ONLY DANISH AND LATIN
PROBABLY THERE WERE SUBSIDENCES OF THE OUTER CRUST WHEN A PORTION OF THE SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS WAS CARRIED DOWN SUDDEN OPENINGS THAT MAY BE I REPLIED
I HAD DIFFICULTY IN ASSOCIATING ANY IDEAS TOGETHER DURING THIS HEADLONG RACE WHICH SEEMED LIKE A VERTICAL DESCENT
MY UNCLE BORE THEM WITH THE ANGRY IMPATIENCE OF A MAN OBLIGED TO OWN HIS WEAKNESS
ELIE DE BEAUMONT
THAT THE NEEDLE INSTEAD OF DIPPING TOWARDS THE POLE AS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ON THE CONTRARY RISES FROM IT WOULD YOU THEN CONCLUDE I SAID THAT THE MAGNETIC POLE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE AND THE POINT WHERE WE ARE EXACTLY SO
AND FORLORAD IS A DANISH WORD
WERE WE DESTINED TO BE THROWN UP OUT OF HECLA OR BY WHICH OF THE SEVEN OTHER FIERY CRATERS IN THAT ISLAND
I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE
ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN
I WAS DROWNING
I COULD NOT FORM THE SLIGHTEST CONJECTURE HOW OR WHEN
BUT HE HAD CERTAINLY SEEN NONE OF THE PRECIOUS LIQUID
HAVE YOU SOME PRIVATE DOCUMENT IN YOUR POSSESSION ASKED OUR HOST
THE DOOR KEY NO NO I CRIED
BUT IN MY OPINION THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE
I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY
HANS STOPPED HERE HALF AN HOUR
THEN IT CAME OUT FULL AT THE MOUTH OF THE GALLERY
SPIRITS WERE THE ONLY LIQUID AND OF WATER WE TOOK NONE
BUT AFTER ALL IT STOOD FIRM THANKS TO AN OLD ELM WHICH BUTTRESSED IT IN FRONT AND WHICH OFTEN IN SPRING SENT ITS YOUNG SPRAYS THROUGH THE WINDOW PANES
I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION
MY IMAGINATION FELL POWERLESS BEFORE SUCH IMMENSITY
THEREFORE ALL THE SUBSTANCES THAT COMPOSE THE BODY OF THIS EARTH MUST EXIST THERE IN A STATE OF INCANDESCENT GAS
IT IS AN EARTHQUAKE THAT IS THREATENING US MY UNDAUNTED UNCLE CALMLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
THAT IS WHAT WE SHALL SEE AH SAID I RATHER PUT OUT
AND MY UNCLE AND THE ICELANDER DID THEIR BEST TO RESTORE ME
IF THE HEAT INCREASED INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING AS WE APPROACHED NEARER TO THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE THIS EFFECT WAS DUE TO LOCAL CAUSES ALONE AND THOSE VOLCANIC
ITS LENGTH SEEMS TO ME A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YARDS
MOST FORTUNATELY ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TO DESCEND
THEN ACTED UPON BY GENERATED GASES AND THE HEAT OF FERMENTATION THEY UNDERWENT A PROCESS OF COMPLETE MINERALIZATION
ALL AT ONCE AN ENORMOUS HEAD IS DARTED UP THE HEAD OF THE PLESIOSAURUS
EXCELLENT SAID MY UNCLE TAKING THE PAPER HASTILY OUT OF MY HANDS
YES YES
I PREFERRED TO ADMIT IN TRUTH THAT THIS CHIMNEY OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO LINED WITH LAVAS WHICH ARE NON-CONDUCTORS OF HEAT DID NOT SUFFER THE HEAT TO PASS THROUGH ITS WALLS
THE TORRENT AFTER HAVING FOR SOME TIME FLOWED OVER OUR HEADS WAS NOW RUNNING WITHIN THE LEFT WALL ROARING AND RUSHING
I GAZED INTO THE DARKNESS
I THEREFORE RUSHED AFTER HIM
THIS IS NOT A RELIC OF THE STONE AGE
ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBENT ST ELMO'S FIRE
F
THE RAFT MOORED TO THE SHORE WAS LEFT ALONE
THE ICELANDER RETURNED TO THE RAFT AND SOON CAME BACK WITH AN IRON BAR WHICH HE MADE USE OF TO BORE A HOLE FOR THE CHARGE
MY EYES ARE FEARFULLY BENT UPON THE SEA
I STARED AT HIM STUPIDLY AND FELT AS IF I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
IT WILL BE AS GOOD FOR US AS GOING TO THE SPA OR TO TOEPLITZ WELL IT IS DELICIOUS OF COURSE IT IS WATER SHOULD BE FOUND SIX MILES UNDERGROUND
BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN WITH A RUSH THROUGH CLOUDS OF BONE DUST HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT
NO DOUBT WHY THIS IS THE VERY LIMIT ASSIGNED BY SCIENCE TO THE THICKNESS OF THE CRUST OF THE EARTH I DON'T DENY IT AND HERE ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF INCREASING TEMPERATURE THERE OUGHT TO BE A HEAT OF 2,732 DEG
MY UNCLE AND I GAZED ON EACH OTHER WITH HAGGARD EYES CLINGING TO THE STUMP OF THE MAST WHICH HAD SNAPPED ASUNDER AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF OUR GREAT CATASTROPHE
THAT MY UNCLE WOULD SURELY NOT BELIEVE IN IT THAT HE WOULD SET IT DOWN AS A MERE PUZZLE
HANS HAS ABANDONED US I CRIED
YES NEVER WAS A QUESTION MORE FORCIBLY PUT
A SLENDER SIP OF WATER CAME TO MOISTEN MY BURNING MOUTH
ONE HOUR AFTER WE HAD LEFT THE GROVE OF OLIVES WE ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE PORT OF SAN VICENZO WHERE HANS CLAIMED HIS THIRTEEN WEEK'S WAGES WHICH WAS COUNTED OUT TO HIM WITH A HEARTY SHAKING OF HANDS ALL ROUND
IT HAD NO TEETH ITS PECTORAL FINS WERE LARGE AND OF TAIL THERE WAS NONE
NONE HAD ORGANS OF SIGHT
BUT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE LAPSE OF TIME
AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM AT ALL
I CAN'T ANSWER
I THOUGHT A BATHE WOULD DO ME GOOD AND I WENT TO PLUNGE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTO THE WATERS OF THIS MEDITERRANEAN SEA FOR ASSUREDLY IT BETTER DESERVED THIS NAME THAN ANY OTHER SEA
OH YES
BUT WE MUST NOT HURRY HIM
IT STANDS ALONE
BUT THIS TENDENCY WHICH WAS VERY TRIFLING COULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO REASSURE THE PROFESSOR
I DON'T WISH TO SAY A WORD AGAINST SO RESPECTABLE A SCIENCE FAR BE THAT FROM ME
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS REFLECTED IN SPARKLING SPLENDOUR FROM THE SCHIST LIMESTONE AND OLD RED SANDSTONE OF THE WALLS
59 DEG
GO AXEL GO MY UNCLE WAS IN HIGH STATE OF EXCITEMENT
THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD
I MERELY SAY IMPRUDENT FOR THE GREAT MIND OF SO LEARNED A MAN OF COURSE HAD NO PLACE FOR LOVE AFFAIRS AND HAPPILY THE GRAND BUSINESS OF THE DOCUMENT GAINED ME THE VICTORY
EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK
TWO COMPASSES VIZ A COMMON COMPASS AND A DIPPING NEEDLE
A MAST WAS MADE OF TWO POLES SPLICED TOGETHER A YARD WAS MADE OF A THIRD A BLANKET BORROWED FROM OUR COVERINGS MADE A TOLERABLE SAIL
HOW MARVELLOUS
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE
WHAT IS THE MATTER GRAEUBEN I CRIED
TO CONCLUDE I HAVE TO ADD THAT THIS JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH CREATED A WONDERFUL SENSATION IN THE WORLD
ICELAND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISLANDS IN EUROPE
WITHOUT REFLECTION WITHOUT ASKING IF THERE WERE ANY MEANS OF PROCURING THE WATER I GAVE WAY TO A MOVEMENT OF DESPAIR
I HAVE THEREFORE GOOD REASON FOR ASKING IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO PENETRATE THROUGH SUCH A MEDIUM SO AXEL IT IS THE HEAT THAT TROUBLES YOU OF COURSE IT IS
THE VAPOROUS MASS SOON GLOWS WITH INCANDESCENT HEAT
I BOTH DESIRED AND FEARED
IF IT WERE NOT THE HORSES WOULD COME TO PASTURE ON THESE GREEN ABODES
LATER ON I CANNOT TELL WHEN A DAZZLING LIGHT FROM SOME LIGHTHOUSE THREW A BRIGHT STREAM OF FIRE ALONG THE WAVES
THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL WAS NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM US
I WAS A PREY TO A KIND OF HALLUCINATION
IT WAS THE FACIFS DESCENSUS AVERNI OF VIRGIL
THEY WERE INVENTED IT IS SAID BY ODIN HIMSELF
BUT IF MY UNCLE FELT NO ATTRACTION TOWARDS THESE ROMANTIC SCENES HE WAS VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH THE ASPECT OF A CERTAIN CHURCH SPIRE SITUATED IN THE ISLAND OF AMAK WHICH FORMS THE SOUTH-WEST QUARTER OF COPENHAGEN
A SOU'-EASTER
INSTEAD OF ASCENDING HE WAS DESCENDING THE GALLERY
BUT AT ONE TIME THE EXPULSIVE FORCE WAS GREATER THAN USUAL AND THIS BLOCK LIKE THE FALLING KEYSTONE OF A RUINED ARCH HAS SLIPPED DOWN TO THE GROUND AND BLOCKED UP THE WAY
WHAT A FLOOD OF INTENSE AND DAZZLING LIGHT
THE TUNNEL INSTEAD OF TENDING LOWER APPROACHED MORE AND MORE NEARLY TO A HORIZONTAL DIRECTION I EVEN FANCIED A SLIGHT RISE
YES WE SHALL SEE
EVERYWHERE AROUND US WE SAW TRUNCATED CONES FORMERLY SO MANY FIERY MOUTHS
SILENCE UPON THE WHOLE SUBJECT
WE ARE FAR AWAY REMOVED FROM THE SHORES
AT KIEL AS ELSEWHERE WE MUST DO SOMETHING TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME
HANS SET ABOUT THE TASK WHICH MY UNCLE AND I TOGETHER COULD NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
IT IS LATIN I JUMPED UP IN MY CHAIR
I EXPECTED TO FIND ALL QUIET THERE MY UNCLE IN BED AS WAS HIS CUSTOM AND MARTHA GIVING HER LAST TOUCHES WITH THE FEATHER BRUSH
A WOMAN'S COURAGE THUS ENDED THIS MEMORABLE SEANCE
I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST
YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
COME THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE
WHICH WOULD GET THE UPPER HAND HE OR THE SECRET
WHAT NATURAL FORCE COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH PLANTS AND WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH IN THE FIRST AGES OF ITS FORMATION WHEN UNDER THE ACTION OF HEAT AND MOISTURE THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ALONE WAS DEVELOPING ON ITS SURFACE
I WATCHED IT IN TREMBLING AND ANXIETY
THIS MUTE CONVERSATION AT SUCH A MOMENTOUS CRISIS WOULD HAVE RIVETED THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST INDIFFERENT
MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK VENTURED TO PENETRATE UNDER THIS COLOSSAL GROVE
BUT THERE WAS A THICK GRANITE WALL BETWEEN US AND THE OBJECT OF OUR DESIRES
DO YOU TAKE IT FOR A PRINTED BOOK YOU IGNORANT FOOL
WHO WOULD HESITATE TO ACQUIRE SUCH RENOWN
I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
FINSEN WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS AS MILITARY AND DISPOSITION AND OFFICE AS PACIFIC AS THE GOVERNOR'S
3
AND BY AND BY WHEN THE WATERS PENETRATED INTO THE FISSURES OF THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THEY BROKE OUT INTO FRESH COMBUSTION WITH EXPLOSIONS AND ERUPTIONS
IT IS A PONIARD SUCH AS GENTLEMEN CARRIED IN THEIR BELTS TO GIVE THE COUP DE GRACE ITS ORIGIN IS SPANISH
I SPENT THAT WHOLE NIGHT IN ONE CONSTANT NIGHTMARE
AND WITHOUT A PAUSE WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S HESITATION I READ OFF THE WHOLE SENTENCE ALOUD
THIS DAGGER BELONGS TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
NOR WAS IT THE PALE AND UNCERTAIN SHIMMER OF THE MOONBEAMS THE DIM REFLECTION OF A NOBLER BODY OF LIGHT
WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT AN OLD QUARTO BOUND IN ROUGH CALF A YELLOW FADED VOLUME WITH A RAGGED SEAL DEPENDING FROM IT
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR
WELL WE ARE AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE FIRST PLANTS AND ANIMALS APPEARED DO YOU THINK SO LOOK CLOSE AND EXAMINE I OBLIGED THE PROFESSOR TO MOVE HIS LAMP OVER THE WALLS OF THE GALLERY
YES NEPHEW
MY UNCLE BEGAN TO ENCOURAGE HIM AS WELL AS HE COULD AND SAID TO HIM IN GOOD GERMAN
MISTOUR REPLIED THE GUIDE
HOW CAN I TELL
I WAS COLD AND MORE HUNGRY THAN COLD
I CONFESS I FELT CONSIDERABLY EXCITED IN COMING TO THE END
THE NAILS OF MY BOOTS CLING TENACIOUSLY TO A PLATE OF IRON LET INTO THE TIMBERS AND I CANNOT DRAW MY FOOT AWAY FROM THE SPOT
WHEN I PUT THEM TOGETHER BY TWOS THREES FIVES OR SIXES NOTHING CAME OF IT BUT NONSENSE
I COULD ONLY COMPARE THEM TO THE LOUD RATTLE OF A LONG TRAIN OF CHARIOTS DRIVEN AT FULL SPEED OVER THE STONES OR A ROAR OF UNINTERMITTING THUNDER
IN HIS IMPATIENCE I BELIEVE HE WAS TRYING TO ACCELERATE THE TRAIN WITH HIS FEET
THEN THE PROFESSOR TOOK THE BOOK AND THE PARCHMENT AND DILIGENTLY COMPARED THEM TOGETHER
WE RETURNED
YET THE TRANSLATOR HOPES THAT WHAT TRIFLING DEVIATIONS FROM THE TEXT OR CORRECTIONS IN FOOT NOTES HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WILL HAVE DONE A LITTLE TOWARDS THE INCREASED USEFULNESS OF THE WORK
TO MY GREAT REGRET I HAD TO EMPLOY THEM IN PREPARATIONS
THE EASTERN AND WESTERN STRANDS SPREAD WIDE AS IF TO BID US FAREWELL
HE HAS DISTURBED SOME MONSTROUS BEAST IN ITS REMOTE DEN AND IF WE ARE NOT ATTACKED ON OUR VOYAGE I LOOK AT OUR GUNS AND SEE THAT THEY ARE ALL RIGHT
I EXPECTED TO SEE A WHITE CONE COVERED WITH THE ETERNAL SNOW OF AGES RISING FROM THE MIDST OF THE BARREN DESERTS OF THE ICY NORTH FAINTLY LIGHTED WITH THE PALE RAYS OF THE ARCTIC SUN FAR AWAY IN THE HIGHEST LATITUDES KNOWN
WE KEPT RUNNING ON FOR FEAR THE HORRIBLE MONSTER MIGHT BE ON OUR TRACK
SNAEFELL
THREE MY PULSE BEAT HALF-SECONDS
EACH OF THESE CHIMNEYS WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER
I COULD NOT GIVE ANY NAME TO THESE SINGULAR CREATIONS
MY UNCLE THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR HIS EXTREME KINDNESS
NO DOUBT OF IT
BUT OTHERS SUCH AS THIS HAVE ONLY GONE THROUGH THE FIRST STAGE OF FOSSIL TRANSFORMATION
A HOLE AND TO CREEP INTO
PERHAPS THE RAFT ITSELF STOPPED IN ITS COURSE BY A PROJECTION WAS STAYING THE VOLCANIC TORRENT
THE DIN AND UPROAR ARE INCESSANT
BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO
THE TEMPERATURE REMAINED WHAT IT HAD BEEN DURING OUR PASSAGE THROUGH THE LAVA AND SCHISTS
AND THE FACT REALLY WAS THAT I DARED NOT SPEAK NOW SO INTENSE WAS THE EXCITEMENT FOR FEAR LEST MY UNCLE SHOULD SMOTHER ME IN HIS FIRST JOYFUL EMBRACES
YES MARTHA
IT WAS SOON PILED UP WITH MY UNCLE'S MULTIFARIOUS PREPARATIONS
NO VAPOUR WAS VISIBLE
STILL IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE AIR UNDER A PRESSURE WHICH MIGHT REACH THAT OF THOUSANDS OF ATMOSPHERES WOULD AT LAST REACH THE SOLID STATE AND THEN EVEN IF OUR BODIES COULD RESIST THE STRAIN WE SHOULD BE STOPPED AND NO REASONINGS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET US ON ANY FARTHER
ON THE CONTRARY I EVEN PROPOSED TO BURN OUR SHIP TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF RETURN
TRANS CHAPTER XXXV
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A STONE FOR A HEARTH OVER IT IN THE ROOF A HOLE TO LET THE SMOKE ESCAPE
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY
THEREFORE THIS WATER ISSUES FROM AN ARDENT FURNACE WHICH IS NOT AT ALL IN HARMONY WITH PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK'S THEORIES
SEE HOW HE IS THROWING OUT AIR AND WATER THROUGH HIS BLOWERS AND IN FACT TWO LIQUID COLUMNS WERE RISING TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA
RUNIC GLYPHS OCCUR HERE THE PROFESSOR MUSED A FEW MOMENTS OVER THIS SERIES OF CHARACTERS
WE WERE IN REALITY SHUT UP INSIDE AN IMMEASURABLE EXCAVATION
MY UNCLE WHOSE HEIGHT HAD NOT BEEN THOUGHT OF IN BUILDING THE HOUSE OF COURSE HIT HIS HEAD SEVERAL TIMES AGAINST THE BEAMS THAT PROJECTED FROM THE CEILINGS
I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY HURT BUT I WAS SHAKEN AND BRUISED AND BATTERED ALL OVER
MY UNCLE LOOKED ROUND WITH DUMB SURPRISE
PENETRATE TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH
A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS
NO PARTICULAR EVENT MARKED THE NEXT DAY
BUT I WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE REALITIES OF THINGS BY THE ARRIVAL OF HANS AND THE PROFESSOR WHO JOINED ME ON THE SUMMIT
IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA
THERE IS A BOAT WHY DID NOT YOU SAY SO THEN
ITS THOUSANDS OF WINDINGS FORMED AN INEXTRICABLE LABYRINTH THROUGH THE PRIMEVAL MASS
CHAPTER XXX
FOR MY OWN PART THE INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY HAD HITHERTO KEPT ME AMUSED AND MADE ME FORGETFUL OF COMING EVILS
BUT NEVER MIND THAT
ABOUT FOUR HANS RISES LAYS HOLD OF THE MAST CLIMBS TO ITS TOP
WE HAVE CROSSED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA SINCE LEAVING PORT GRAEUBEN
SUBLIMED INTO IMPONDERABLE VAPOUR I MINGLE AND AM LOST IN THE ENDLESS FOODS OF THOSE VAST GLOBULAR VOLUMES OF VAPOROUS MISTS WHICH ROLL UPON THEIR FLAMING ORBITS THROUGH INFINITE SPACE
THAT IS WHAT WE SHALL SEE SO SAYS THE PROFESSOR WHO HAVING NAMED THIS VOLCANIC ISLET AFTER HIS NEPHEW GIVES THE SIGNAL TO EMBARK AGAIN
MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WHO WAS FRANTICALLY LOCKING HIS LEGS TOGETHER TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM JUMPING UP IN THE AIR THAT IS WHERE I MEAN TO BEGIN MY GEOLOGICAL STUDIES THERE ON THAT SEFFEL--FESSEL--WHAT DO YOU CALL IT SNAEFELL REPLIED THE EXCELLENT M
NO CHANGE IN OUR SITUATION
I AM PASSED AGAINST MY WILL IN RETROGRADE ORDER THROUGH THE LONG SERIES OF TERRESTRIAL CHANGES
DO THEY PROCEED FROM THE SKY OR THE OCEAN
WE CANNOT EVEN MAKE OURSELVES HEARD BY APPROACHING OUR MOUTH CLOSE TO THE EAR
THIS HYPOTHESIS LED ME TO EXAMINE WITH MORE ATTENTION THE APPEARANCE OF THE SURFACE AND I SOON ARRIVED AT A CONCLUSION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE FORCES WHICH PRESIDED AT ITS BIRTH
YES SAID MY UNCLE WAS HE STOPPED BY THIS STONE BARRIER NO NO I REPLIED WITH ANIMATION
NOW SAID MY UNCLE AFTER HAVING COMPLETED THESE PREPARATIONS NOW LET US LOOK TO OUR LOADS
TOTAL FAILURE OF WATER THIS TIME THE DESCENT COMMENCED BY THE NEW GALLERY
I WAS POSSESSED WITH A PRESENTIMENT OF COMING EVIL
HERE IS THE LOWER JAW OF A MASTODON 1 I SAID
IN SPITE OF THE REPROACHES WHICH I CONSIDERED I HAD A RIGHT TO LAY UPON HIM A CERTAIN FEELING OF COMPASSION WAS BEGINNING TO GAIN UPON ME
AND WITH THAT SIMPLE WORD HE LEFT US AND SAILED FOR REJKIAVIK WHICH HE REACHED IN SAFETY
COME DO COME I SAID TO MY UNCLE WHO FOR ONCE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED
I DREW BACK MY UNCLE
THE MONSTER IS WOUNDED TO DEATH
I ATE WITHOUT PLEASURE ALMOST WITH DISGUST
WE HAD NO TIME TO WATCH THESE PHENOMENA
LET US REEF THE SAIL AND CUT THE MAST DOWN I CRIED
THE LANTERN OUTSIDE OF THE BAG THROWS SUFFICIENT LIGHT INTO DEEP DARKNESS
AT SIX WE WERE AFOOT
IT IS A GREAT THING THAT WE CAN HEAR EACH OTHER DURING THIS TIME I HAD BEEN REFLECTING
I AM THEREFORE ENTITLED TO PRONOUNCE THIS A PRIORI TO BE LATIN
THE TEMPERATURE WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE
ONE FACT ONE INCIDENT OF THE JOURNEY REMAINED A MYSTERY
TRULY IT IS WONDERFUL THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN KILLED A HUNDRED TIMES OVER
INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS DINNER WAS READY
EVERY BIT OF CORDAGE WAS PUT ON BOARD
NOW THIS ARRANGEMENT HAS EVIDENTLY NOT BEEN PREMEDITATED
NO ABATEMENT OF THE STORM
IN SPITE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND FELT I BELIEVE AND ALWAYS SHALL BELIEVE IN THE CENTRAL HEAT
AN HOUR PASSED AWAY--TWO HOURS PERHAPS--I CANNOT TELL
I DRESSED IN HASTE
ON THE 19TH OF JUNE FOR ABOUT A MILE THAT IS AN ICELANDIC MILE WE WALKED UPON HARDENED LAVA
I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK
THEN HIS FURY WOULD GRADUALLY ABATE
WHAT IS THIS I ASKED SHAKEN BY THIS SUDDEN STOPPAGE AS IF BY A SHOCK
INSTRUMENTS HERE ARMS THERE TOOLS IN THIS PACKAGE PROVISIONS IN THAT
THEREFORE THESE VOLUMES ARE PASSED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER READ OVER AND OVER REFERRED TO AGAIN AND AGAIN
SPECIMENS OF EVERYTHING KNOWN IN MINERALOGY LAY THERE IN THEIR PLACES IN PERFECT ORDER AND CORRECTLY NAMED DIVIDED INTO INFLAMMABLE METALLIC AND LITHOID MINERALS
THIS MADE ABOUT A POUND OF NOURISHMENT FOR EACH
HE MOVED TOWARDS THE WALL
IT SEEMED AS IF ONE OF HELBESMER'S RAISED MAPS LAY AT MY FEET
YET I CONTROLLED MYSELF
AS FOR THE BISHOP'S SUFFRAGAN M
THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH WE WERE MOVING WAS SUCH A FISSURE THROUGH WHICH AT ONE TIME GRANITE POURED OUT IN A MOLTEN STATE
GREENLAND SAID HE
NOW LET US TRY ITALIAN SAID MY UNCLE
HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF
TUESDAY AUGUST 25._--I RECOVER FROM A LONG SWOON
WHEN IT APPROACHED THE WALLS OF THE GALLERY I THREW ON THEM THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN AND I COULD JUDGE SOMEWHAT OF THE VELOCITY OF OUR SPEED BY NOTICING HOW THE JAGGED PROJECTIONS OF THE ROCKS SPUN INTO ENDLESS RIBBONS AND BANDS SO THAT WE SEEMED CONFINED WITHIN A NETWORK OF SHIFTING LINES
DE PROFUNDIS I THEREFORE AWOKE NEXT DAY RELIEVED FROM THE PREOCCUPATION OF AN IMMEDIATE START
TO HIM IT SEEMED A VERY SIMPLE THING TO GO TO ICELAND AS THAT WAS HIS BUSINESS
FINALLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO I ASKED
IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
THIS WAS A DIFFICULTY
AXEL SHE SAID I HAVE HAD A LONG TALK WITH MY GUARDIAN
IS IT ICELAND I ASKED
TO COMPLETE THE EXACT INVENTORY OF ALL OUR TRAVELLING ACCOMPANIMENTS I MUST NOT FORGET A POCKET MEDICINE CHEST CONTAINING BLUNT SCISSORS SPLINTS FOR BROKEN LIMBS A PIECE OF TAPE OF UNBLEACHED LINEN BANDAGES AND COMPRESSES LINT A LANCET FOR BLEEDING ALL DREADFUL ARTICLES TO TAKE WITH ONE
THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES WITH UNABATED FEROCITY
ALTHOUGH WE WERE IN THE VERY DEEPEST OF KNOWN DEPTHS THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT UNPLEASANT ABOUT IT
WHAT CRIED MY UNCLE
I HARDLY DARED GUESS WHAT THE HUNTER WAS ABOUT TO DO
CERTAINLY THERE WAS NO LACK OF CRATERS AND THERE WERE SOME CAPACIOUS ENOUGH TO THROW OUT A WHOLE ARMY
HANS HAD FITTED UP A RUDDER TO STEER HIS VESSEL
MY UNCLE HAD BEEN ALL THE MORNING MAKING PURCHASES OF A PART OF THE TOOLS AND APPARATUS REQUIRED FOR THIS DESPERATE UNDERTAKING
THIS TRACT SEEMED CRUSHED UNDER A RAIN OF ENORMOUS EJECTED ROCKS OF TRAP BASALT GRANITE AND ALL KINDS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS
BUT IT IS LIKEWISE THE CREED ADOPTED BY OTHER DISTINGUISHED GEOLOGISTS THAT THE INTERIOR OF THE GLOBE IS NEITHER GAS NOR WATER NOR ANY OF THE HEAVIEST MINERALS KNOWN FOR IN NONE OF THESE CASES WOULD THE EARTH WEIGH WHAT IT DOES OH WITH FIGURES YOU MAY PROVE ANYTHING BUT IS IT THE SAME WITH FACTS
THAT IS POSSIBLE TOO IT IS CERTAIN EXCLAIMED MY UNCLE IN A TONE OF TRIUMPH
I LAY OVERWHELMED AGHAST
WELL WHATEVER MOUNTAIN THIS MAY BE HE SAID AT LAST IT IS VERY HOT HERE
THERE OR ELSEWHERE DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH OR ANYWHERE ON THE SURFACE ALL WAS ALIKE TO HIM
AND THE DESCENT COMMENCED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER
UP OF COURSE
FORWARD WHEN IN ITS EARLY STAGES THE EARTH WAS SLOWLY COOLING ITS CONTRACTION GAVE RISE IN ITS CRUST TO DISRUPTIONS DISTORTIONS FISSURES AND CHASMS
BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
BUT I WAS MISTAKEN
NOW FOR THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE HE ADDED IN DANISH
IT LOOKED UPON ONE OF THOSE WINDING CANALS WHICH INTERSECT EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT QUARTER OF HAMBURG AND WHICH THE GREAT FIRE OF 1842 HAD FORTUNATELY SPARED
UNCLE WHAT WOOD IS THIS I CRIED
THE TUNNEL WAS FILLING WITH STEAM WHILST A STREAM WAS FORMING WHICH BY DEGREES WANDERED AWAY INTO SUBTERRANEAN WINDINGS AND SOON WE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SWALLOWING OUR FIRST DRAUGHT
I STRUCK AGAINST AN IMPENETRABLE WALL AND FELL DOWN UPON THE ROCK
THIS WONDERFUL UNDERGROUND CONVERSATION CARRIED ON WITH A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES AND A QUARTER BETWEEN US CONCLUDED WITH THESE WORDS OF HOPE
THIS VERSION IS BELIEVED TO BE THE MOST FAITHFUL RENDITION INTO ENGLISH OF THIS CLASSIC CURRENTLY IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
BEFORE STARTING AFRESH I THOUGHT A WASH WOULD DO ME GOOD
ANOTHER THREE HOURS AND I SAW NO BOTTOM TO THE CHIMNEY YET
NOT A GREEN LEAF ANYWHERE AND THE FLOWERS--WHICH WERE ABUNDANT ENOUGH IN THE TERTIARY PERIOD WHICH FIRST GAVE BIRTH TO FLOWERS--LOOKED LIKE BROWN-PAPER FLOWERS WITHOUT COLOUR OR SCENT
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH A TRANSLATION
HE CARRIED ECONOMY OF MOTION EVEN TO PARSIMONY
MY UNCLE WAS JUST AS COURTEOUSLY RECEIVED BY THE MAYOR M
I SAW HOUSES SQUASHED FLAT AS IF THEY HAD ALL FALLEN DOWN FROM THE SKIES
OBEYING ORDERS HANS TIED ALL THE NON-FRAGILE ARTICLES IN ONE BUNDLE CORDED THEM FIRMLY AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US
THIS BEGINS TO LOOK JUST LIKE AN ANCIENT DOCUMENT
HANS APPEARED
THERE WAS A SHARP BREEZE AND A ROUGH SEA A FEW LIGHTS APPEARED ON SHORE THROUGH THE THICK DARKNESS
OUT OF 1,600 LEAGUES WE HAVE GONE TWELVE SO YOU SAY AND THESE TWELVE AT A COST OF 85 LEAGUES DIAGONALLY EXACTLY SO IN TWENTY DAYS YES NOW SIXTEEN LEAGUES ARE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE EARTH'S RADIUS
CHAPTER XIV
SUPPOSE THE TORRENT BURSTING THROUGH SHOULD DROWN US IN A SUDDEN FLOOD
THEN I FELT AS IF NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT THE RAFT ALSO HAD NO SUPPORT BENEATH
HAILSTONES RATTLE FIERCELY DOWN AND AS THEY DASH UPON OUR IRON TOOLS THEY TOO EMIT GLEAMS AND FLASHES OF LURID LIGHT
I WILL RUN AND HIDE MYSELF WHILE YOU ARGUE WITH HIM AND MARTHA RETREATED IN SAFETY INTO HER OWN DOMINIONS
ARE YOU SURPRISED AT THIS WANT OF SPRINGS HE SAID
IS THE CHILD DUMB CRIED THE PROFESSOR WHO PROUD OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANY LANGUAGES NOW TRIED FRENCH
A DEEP SILENCE REIGNED AROUND US THE SILENCE OF THE GRAVE
BUT THE PROFESSOR AS A POLYGLOT QUESTIONED HIM IN GOOD DANISH AND IT WAS IN THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT THAT PERSONAGE DIRECTED HIM TO THE MUSEUM OF NORTHERN ANTIQUITIES
WHICH I HAVE DONE ARNE SAKNUSSEMM IN READING THIS MY UNCLE GAVE A SPRING AS IF HE HAD TOUCHED A LEYDEN JAR
I GAVE MYSELF UP FOR LOST
HUNGER ONCE SATISFIED IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A MAN TO IMAGINE THE HORRORS OF STARVATION
I WAS SURE I SHOULD FIND MY WAY AGAIN
WHAT THEN MUST OTHER TRACTS BE MORE DESERT THAN THIS DESERT
HANS STOPS ME BY A GESTURE
MY UNCLE STAMPED WITH HIS FOOT WHILE THE HORSES WENT ON TO THE BOAT
A LEPER MY UNCLE REPEATED
THE ICELANDERS THOUGH BURDENED WITH OUR LOADS CLIMBED WITH THE AGILITY OF MOUNTAINEERS
I STOPPED I LOOKED UNDERNEATH THE BLOCK
AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE
DO YOU REMEMBER A VISIT PAID TO ME BY THE CELEBRATED CHEMIST HUMPHRY DAVY IN 1825 NOT AT ALL FOR I WAS NOT BORN UNTIL NINETEEN YEARS AFTERWARDS WELL HUMPHRY DAVY DID CALL UPON ME ON HIS WAY THROUGH HAMBURG
IT WAS NOW FOUR O'CLOCK AND WE HAD GONE FOUR ICELANDIC MILES OR TWENTY-FOUR ENGLISH MILES
WITH THIS WE POSSESSED THE PROPER INTRODUCTIONS TO THE GOVERNOR OF ICELAND
HE SENT A KICK HERE A THUMP THERE
THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE
A PHENOMENON OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT HAVE GREATLY ALARMED ME OR AT ANY RATE IT WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS
THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE HERE BUT A FEW HOUSES SCARCELY ENOUGH FOR A GERMAN HAMLET
WATER I CRIED CLAPPING MY HANDS AND GESTICULATING LIKE A MADMAN
AFTER BREAKFAST THE PROFESSOR GAVE A FEW HOURS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS DAILY NOTES
COME SI NOMA QUESTA ISOLA STROMBOLI REPLIED THE LITTLE HERDBOY SLIPPING OUT OF HANS HANDS AND SCUDDING INTO THE PLAIN ACROSS THE OLIVE TREES
AS FOR ITS DIP A CURIOUS FACT IS COMING TO LIGHT WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED CAREFULLY
A SUBTERRANEAN RIVER IS FLOWING AROUND US WE HURRIED FORWARD IN THE GREATEST EXCITEMENT
ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS NOW OUT OF THE REACH OF THE HIGHEST TIDES THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE M
CEASELESS FIERY ARROWS DART IN AND OUT AMONGST THE FLYING THUNDER-CLOUDS
YES I REPLIED COMPLETELY GONE WELL
IF YOU HAD NOT DESERTED ME LIKE A FOOL I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU TO THE COPENHAGEN OFFICE TO LIFFENDER CO AND YOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED THEN THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE TRIP EVERY MONTH FROM COPENHAGEN TO REJKIAVIK ON THE 22ND WELL WELL IF WE WAITED FOR THE 22ND JUNE WE SHOULD BE TOO LATE TO SEE THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS TOUCH THE CRATER OF SNEFFELS
IT SEEMS AXEL THAT THIS GOOD MAN IS THE RECTOR OUR GUIDE IN THE MEANWHILE WAS MAKING THE KYRKOHERDE AWARE OF THE POSITION OF THINGS
WE SLID DOWN SCREES OF ASHES CAREFULLY AVOIDING THE LAVA STREAMS WHICH GLIDED SLUGGISHLY BY US LIKE FIERY SERPENTS
I WAS IN AN AGONY OF IMPATIENCE
A ROPE FASTENED TO THE EDGE OF THE APERTURE MIGHT HAVE HELPED US DOWN
I AM THEREFORE LED TO IMAGINE CONTINUED MY UNCLE THAT SOME POSSESSOR OF THIS BOOK WROTE THESE MYSTERIOUS LETTERS
HE SEES SOMETHING SAYS MY UNCLE
BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME
I RAISED MY HEAD AND SAW STRAIGHT ABOVE ME THE UPPER APERTURE OF THE CONE FRAMING A BIT OF SKY OF VERY SMALL CIRCUMFERENCE BUT ALMOST PERFECTLY ROUND
TO HIS MISFORTUNE MY UNCLE WAS NOT GIFTED WITH A SUFFICIENTLY RAPID UTTERANCE
WHAT NEW TREASURES LAY HERE FOR SCIENCE TO UNFOLD
ON RETURNING TO THE MAIN STREET I FOUND THE GREATER PART OF THE POPULATION BUSIED IN DRYING SALTING AND PUTTING ON BOARD CODFISH THEIR CHIEF EXPORT
MY UNCLE MADE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AT ALL
THE MOVEMENTS OF THIS NATIVE WERE LITHE AND SUPPLE
AT FIVE NEXT MORNING WE BADE OUR HOST FAREWELL MY UNCLE WITH DIFFICULTY PERSUADING HIM TO ACCEPT A PROPER REMUNERATION
FOR TWO HOURS NOTHING WAS CAUGHT
YOU SEE SAID THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE NOW ONLY THE PRESSURE OF OUR ATMOSPHERE AND I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN THE ANEROID TAKES THE PLACE OF THE BAROMETER AND IN TRUTH THIS INSTRUMENT WOULD BECOME USELESS AS SOON AS THE WEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD EXCEED THE PRESSURE ASCERTAINED AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
MY UNCLE WENT ON WORKING HIS IMAGINATION WENT OFF RAMBLING INTO THE IDEAL WORLD OF COMBINATIONS
WHITE AND GHASTLY MISTS WRAP ROUND THE SHIFTING FORMS OF THE EARTH WHICH BY IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES DISSOLVES INTO A GASEOUS MASS GLOWING FIERY RED AND WHITE AS LARGE AND AS SHINING AS THE SUN
ICELAND THE STARTING POINT OF THE MARVELLOUS UNDERGROUND JOURNEY IMAGINED IN THIS VOLUME IS INVESTED AT THE PRESENT TIME WITH A PAINFUL INTEREST IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISASTROUS ERUPTIONS LAST EASTER DAY WHICH COVERED WITH LAVA AND ASHES THE POOR AND SCANTY VEGETATION UPON WHICH FOUR THOUSAND PERSONS WERE PARTLY DEPENDENT FOR THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE
HERE THERE WAS NOT AN ATOM
THERE HANS BID US COME TO A HALT AND A HASTY BREAKFAST WAS SERVED OUT
I WAS FORGETTING WHERE AND WHO I WAS TO LIVE THE LIFE OF ELVES AND SYLPHS THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS
BUT I HAD THE COURAGE TO PRESERVE SILENCE
SET SAIL SHALL WE
IN THIS ICY REGION WE ARE FOND OF STUDY
IT HAS BROUGHT US BACK TO THIS COAST FROM WHICH FINE WEATHER WOULD HAVE CARRIED US FAR AWAY
HE HAD EVEN STOPPED FOR A WHILE TO STRAP HIS BAGGAGE BETTER OVER HIS SHOULDERS
AND NOW I SHALL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT A GUIDE I HAVE ONE TO OFFER YOU A SAFE INTELLIGENT MAN YES
THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS OR OF MY OWN FOR THE FOOT LEFT NO MARK UPON THE GRANITE FLOOR
IT ENABLES ONE TO VENTURE WITHOUT FEAR OF EXPLOSIONS INTO THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES AND IS NOT EXTINGUISHED EVEN IN THE DEEPEST WATERS
I DO PERFECTLY
WITH THE STREAM AT MY FEET I MIGHT HOPE TO REGAIN THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL
I WAS EXAMINING THE BEDS OF GRANITE
I SPENT IT DREAMING OF ABYSSES
WE CONTINUED OUR ZIGZAG CLIMB
COULD HE BE TRYING TO MEASURE THE THICKNESS OF THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THAT LAY BETWEEN US AND THE WORLD ABOVE
MY EYES UNACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT QUICKLY CLOSED
HE OBTAINED IN 1864 THE QUINQUENNIAL PRIZE OF 50,000 FRANC RESERVED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT FOR THE MOST INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY
MY HEAD STRUCK AGAINST A SHARP CORNER OF THE ROCK AND I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
HE TIED THE HEAVIEST OF OUR PICKAXES TO A LONG ROPE WHICH HE LET DOWN TWO HUNDRED FATHOMS
THE HOST SERVED OUT TO US A SOUP MADE OF LICHEN AND BY NO MEANS UNPLEASANT THEN AN IMMENSE PIECE OF DRIED FISH FLOATING IN BUTTER RANCID WITH TWENTY YEARS KEEPING AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO ICELANDIC GASTRONOMY MUCH PREFERABLE TO FRESH BUTTER
IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER
BUT I HAVE GOOD REASON FOR REMEMBERING ONE VERY SERIOUS EVENT WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THIS TIME AND OF WHICH I COULD SCARCELY NOW FORGET THE SMALLEST DETAILS
BUT WELL UNCLE WE ARE GOING TO RESUME THE NORTHERN ROUTE AND TO PASS UNDER THE NORTH COUNTRIES OF EUROPE--UNDER SWEDEN RUSSIA SIBERIA
I STOOD AMAZED
THE HOUSE WAS HIS OWN AND EVERYTHING IN IT
THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE
USUALLY THE ENGLISH AND FRENCH CONSERVATORS OF FISHERIES MOOR IN THIS BAY BUT JUST THEN THEY WERE CRUISING ABOUT THE WESTERN COASTS OF THE ISLAND
FOR HE LAID HOLD OF MY ARM AND SPEECHLESSLY QUESTIONED ME WITH HIS EYES
I WAS SUPPLIED WITH A LIGHTED LANTERN TO SET FIRE TO THE FUSE
OUR FATE HAS FLUNG US HERE AMONG BURNING LAVAS MOLTEN ROCKS BOILING WATERS AND ALL KINDS OF VOLCANIC MATTER
ON THE LEFT HUGE PYRAMIDS OF ROCK PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER PRODUCED A PRODIGIOUS TITANIC EFFECT
STARTING FROM THE TOP OF THE TOWER AN EXTERNAL STAIRCASE WOUND AROUND THE SPIRE THE SPIRALS CIRCLING UP INTO THE SKY
THERE'S NOTHING EASIER
BUT WHO WAS THAT POSSESSOR
I WOULD THINK NO LONGER
TEN YARDS MORE AND I HAD JOINED HER
BUT FOR THE PRECAUTION OF OUR GUIDE OUR MANGLED BODIES TORN AND POUNDED INTO FRAGMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED AFAR LIKE THE RUINS HURLED ALONG BY SOME UNKNOWN METEOR
MY UNCLE SHALL NEVER KNOW IT
THERE ARE NOT TWO ROADS
ABOUT NOON HUNGER BEGAN TO STIMULATE ME SEVERELY
HE HAD DRUNK NOTHING HIMSELF
HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA
HAS NOT THE STREAM THAT WE FOLLOWED LED US ALTOGETHER ASTRAY AT ANY RATE WE CANNOT FEEL SORRY TO HAVE COME SO FAR
FOR MY PRETTY VIRLANDAISE RESIGNING HER PLACE AS WARD TOOK HER POSITION IN THE OLD HOUSE ON THE KOENIGSTRASSE IN THE DOUBLE CAPACITY OF NIECE TO MY UNCLE AND WIFE TO A CERTAIN HAPPY YOUTH
UP CONTINUALLY
MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
TO MY AMAZEMENT HE PLACED IT ON MY LIPS
HANS WAS A GOOD CATERER FOR OUR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD
I WAS REFLECTING THAT IF YOUR CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT WE ARE NO LONGER UNDER ICELAND DO YOU THINK SO I AM NOT MISTAKEN I SAID AND EXAMINING THE MAP I ADDED WE HAVE PASSED CAPE PORTLAND AND THOSE FIFTY LEAGUES BRING US UNDER THE WIDE EXPANSE OF OCEAN UNDER THE SEA MY UNCLE REPEATED RUBBING HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT
HANS AND HIS COMRADES SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC
AT NOON HANS PREPARED A HOOK AT THE END OF A LINE
THE GESTURES THEMSELVES WERE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT WE WERE EACH BENT ON TAKING A DIFFERENT ROAD
AND AS THEIR USUAL VENT WAS CLOSED IT WAS TO BE FEARED LEST EXTREME TENSION SHOULD GIVE RISE TO AN EXPLOSION SOONER OR LATER
VERY WELL THEN
THE PROFESSOR THE GUIDE THE RAFT--ARE ALL GONE OUT OF MY KEN
AND YET UNDER A LAW UNKNOWN TO ME THERE WERE BROAD TRACTS OF VAPOUR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR
THE LONG-CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
THE COAL MEASURES OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO THIS PERIOD OF PROFUSE VEGETATION
STILL THE TEMPERATURE KEPT RISING AND I FELT MYSELF STEEPED IN A BROILING ATMOSPHERE
THE FIRST LETTER IS A DOUBLE M A LETTER WHICH IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN TURLLESON'S BOOK AND WHICH WAS ONLY ADDED TO THE ALPHABET IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
THEREFORE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED YEARS BETWEEN THE MANUSCRIPT AND THE DOCUMENT I ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS A STRICTLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION
OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS
YES SAID HE YOUR WORDS DECIDE ME
THIS GROUND IS CALLED IN THE COUNTRY HRAUN
THE COLOSSAL MASTODON NIPPLE-TOOTHED TWISTS AND UNTWISTS HIS TRUNK AND BRAYS AND POUNDS WITH HIS HUGE TUSKS THE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT COVER THE SHORE
AFTER PASSING THE HIGHER ROCK IT CAME DOWN AGAIN BRINGING WITH IT A RATHER DANGEROUS SHOWER OF BITS OF STONE AND LAVA
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THIS BRILLIANT FETE OF ILLUMINATIONS UNDERWENT A SENSIBLE ABATEMENT OF SPLENDOUR THEN ALMOST CEASED
FOR THIS REASON
I EXPECTED SOME SIGNS OF ASTONISHMENT
ITS BLADE IS COATED WITH A RUST NEITHER A DAY NOR A YEAR NOR A HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE PROFESSOR WAS GETTING EXCITED ACCORDING TO HIS WONT AND WAS ALLOWING HIS IMAGINATION TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM
THE LAMPS WERE HUNG UPON A PROJECTION IN THE LAVA
RUNIC CHARACTERS WERE IN USE IN ICELAND IN FORMER AGES
THE OTHER STREET RUNNING WEST ENDS AT THE LITTLE LAKE BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF THE BISHOP AND OTHER NON-COMMERCIAL PEOPLE
AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY
THE SMALLEST OF THEM WOULD HAVE CRUNCHED OUR RAFT CREW AND ALL AT ONE SNAP OF ITS HUGE JAWS
THAT IS THE EASIEST WAY TO SHELVE THE DIFFICULTY INDEED SIR
MY EYES WERE DIM I COULD SCARCELY SEE
I FOUND SOME AMUSEMENT IN TRACING THESE ENDLESS WAVES ALWAYS THINKING I SHOULD COME TO THE END OF THEM AND FOR HOURS MY PATIENCE WAS VYING WITH MY SURPRISE
CONFOUNDED BRUTE CRIED THE UNHORSED HORSEMAN SUDDENLY DEGRADED INTO A PEDESTRIAN JUST AS ASHAMED AS A CAVALRY OFFICER DEGRADED TO A FOOT SOLDIER
THE GENERAL EFFECT WAS SAD SUPREMELY MELANCHOLY
BUT WE DID NOT TROUBLE OURSELVES ABOUT MERE TRIFLES
THE START WAS FIXED FOR THE 16TH OF JUNE
YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME
HANS GLANCED AT ME WITH I THOUGHT A SMILE OF COMPASSION
FREQUENTLY I TOUCHED THE WALL HOPING TO FEEL SOME INDICATIONS OF MOISTURE
ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER THE 4TH WE EMBARKED ON THE STEAMER VOLTURNO EMPLOYED BY THE FRENCH MESSAGERIES IMPERIALES AND IN THREE DAYS MORE WE WERE AT MARSEILLES HAVING NO CARE ON OUR MINDS EXCEPT THAT ABOMINABLE DECEITFUL COMPASS WHICH WE HAD MISLAID SOMEWHERE AND COULD NOT NOW EXAMINE
MY UNCLE NOTED EVERY HOUR THE INDICATIONS OF THE COMPASS THE CHRONOMETER THE ANEROID AND THE THERMOMETER THE VERY SAME WHICH HE HAS PUBLISHED IN HIS SCIENTIFIC REPORT OF OUR JOURNEY
IS THERE SOME MONSTER BENEATH US BELONGING TO THE EXTINCT RACES MORE VORACIOUS THAN THE SHARK MORE FEARFUL IN VASTNESS THAN THE WHALE
BUT THERE WAS A CLOUD HANGING FAR ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WE ESTIMATED AT 12,000 FEET A GREATER HEIGHT THAN THAT OF ANY TERRESTRIAL VAPOUR AND NO DOUBT DUE TO THE GREAT DENSITY OF THE AIR
HOW LONG I REMAINED PLUNGED IN AGONIZING REFLECTIONS I CANNOT TELL
WE HAD TURNED THE GREAT BAY OF FAXA AND THE TWIN PEAKS OF SNAEFELL ROSE WHITE INTO THE CLOUDY SKY AT THE DISTANCE OF AT LEAST FIVE MILES
NOT A TREE WAS TO BE SEEN UNLESS WE EXCEPT A FEW DWARF BIRCHES AS LOW AS BRUSHWOOD
BUT BY ST MICHAEL IF YOU SHOULD DARE TO DECEIVE ME THE DICTATION COMMENCED
AS FOR MY UNCLE HE WAS BEGINNING TO STORM AGAINST THE HORIZONTAL ROAD
ONE DAY WHILE ARRANGING A COLLECTION OF MINERALS IN HIS CABINET I NOTICED IN A CORNER THIS UNHAPPY COMPASS WHICH WE HAD LONG LOST SIGHT OF
CHAPTER XLI
THE FACT IS THAT DURING THE COURSE OF HIS LECTURES AT THE JOHANNAEUM THE PROFESSOR OFTEN CAME TO A COMPLETE STANDSTILL
THEY GAPED BEFORE US RIGHT IN OUR PATH
I COULD HEAR HIM MURMURING GEOLOGICAL TERMS
WHERE IS THE BUNDLE WE SENT DOWN BEFORE US I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE
NEJ REPEATS HANS LEISURELY SHAKING HIS HEAD
WHILST THE MEGATHERIUM HUGE BEAST BUTTRESSED UPON HIS ENORMOUS HINDER PAWS GRUBS IN THE SOIL AWAKING THE SONOROUS ECHOES OF THE GRANITE ROCKS WITH HIS TREMENDOUS ROARINGS
THIS FEMUR MUST HAVE BELONGED TO THE GREATEST OF THOSE BEASTS THE MEGATHERIUM
A LARGE CARRIAGE WAS THERE TO TAKE US TO THE ALTONA RAILWAY STATION
DON'T YOU HEAR THE HAMMER AT WORK
YET FROM TIME TO TIME WE SEEMED TO DESCRY A HUMAN FIGURE THAT FLED AT OUR APPROACH SOMETIMES A SHARP TURN WOULD BRING US SUDDENLY WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF ONE OF THESE SPECTRES AND I WAS FILLED WITH LOATHING AT THE SIGHT OF A HUGE DEFORMED HEAD THE SKIN SHINING AND HAIRLESS AND REPULSIVE SORES VISIBLE THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE POOR CREATURE'S WRETCHED RAGS
I HAD LAID THE PAPER UPON THE TABLE
I PLUNGE A REGISTER THERMOMETER INTO THE BOILING WATER
WE WERE ASCENDING WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY
AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
IT STILL LINED THE WALLS WITH A THICK AND GLISTENING COAT
HANS HIRED THE SERVICES OF THREE ICELANDERS TO DO THE DUTY OF THE HORSES IN THE TRANSPORT OF THE BURDENS
SUDDENLY MY EAR RESTING BY CHANCE AGAINST THE WALL CAUGHT OR SEEMED TO CATCH CERTAIN VAGUE INDESCRIBABLE DISTANT ARTICULATE SOUNDS AS OF WORDS
BUT WE DID NOT COME SO FAR TO BE PRUDENT
THE WEATHER--IF WE MAY USE THAT TERM--WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
ABOUT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A NEW INCIDENT OCCURRED
THESE IDEAS IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO MY MIND IN A VAGUE AND UNDETERMINED FORM
WHERE SAID I STEPPING NEAR TO HIM
NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES
FORTY SECONDS BETWEEN THE TWO WORDS
MY UNCLE POINTED OUT TO ME IN THE FAR WEST A LIGHT STEAM OR MIST A SEMBLANCE OF LAND WHICH BOUNDED THE DISTANT HORIZON OF WATERS
WHO BUT HE
LISTENING MORE ATTENTIVELY I HEARD IN REALITY A MURMURING OF VOICES
I MUST THUS ARRIVE AT THE POINT WHERE I HAD LEFT THE STREAM THAT FATAL TURN IN THE ROAD
SOON THE SWIFTNESS OF THE DESCENT INCREASED HORRIBLY AND THREATENED TO BECOME A FALL
A MAN WHO IS STARTING FOR THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NEED NOT BE PARTICULAR ABOUT A FEW RIX DOLLARS
SHOULD WE EVER KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ITS OPPOSITE SHORES
THEREFORE THAT MYSTERIOUS CENTRE OF ATTRACTION IS AT NO GREAT DEPTH I REMARKED
WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE I SEE A PENINSULA LOOKING LIKE A THIGH BONE WITH THE KNEE BONE AT THE END OF IT A VERY FAIR COMPARISON MY LAD
THEIR COSTUME CONSISTED OF A COARSE JACKET OF BLACK WOOLLEN CLOTH CALLED IN SCANDINAVIAN LANDS A VADMEL A HAT WITH A VERY BROAD BRIM TROUSERS WITH A NARROW EDGE OF RED AND A BIT OF LEATHER ROLLED ROUND THE FOOT FOR SHOES
I HASTENED FORWARD
I HAD RATHER ADMIT THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOME ANIMAL WHOSE STRUCTURE RESEMBLED THE HUMAN SOME APE OR BABOON OF THE EARLY GEOLOGICAL AGES SOME PROTOPITHECA OR SOME MESOPITHECA SOME EARLY OR MIDDLE APE LIKE THAT DISCOVERED BY MR LARTET IN THE BONE CAVE OF SANSAU
AT LAST HE GAVE A PRELIMINARY COUGH AND WITH PROFOUND GRAVITY NAMING IN SUCCESSION THE FIRST THEN THE SECOND LETTER OF EACH WORD HE DICTATED ME THE FOLLOWING
MY UNCLE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HURRY HAD SO WELL CALCULATED THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TRAIN AND THE STEAMER THAT WE HAD A WHOLE DAY TO SPARE
HE WAS FAR AWAY FROM EARTH AND REALLY FAR AWAY FROM EARTHLY WANTS
IT WAS FELT AT ONCE THAT HE WOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO NOBODY THAT HE WORKED FOR HIS OWN CONVENIENCE AND THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD COULD ASTONISH OR DISTURB HIS PHILOSOPHIC CALMNESS
FOR THE TUNNEL NOW RUNNING STRAIGHT NOW WINDING AS CAPRICIOUSLY IN ITS INCLINES AS IN ITS TURNINGS BUT CONSTANTLY PRESERVING ITS SOUTH-EASTERLY DIRECTION AND ALWAYS RUNNING DEEPER WAS GRADUALLY CARRYING US TO VERY GREAT DEPTHS INDEED
WE WERE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURES IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD
I REFUSE TO GO FURTHER
THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
THE WALL THAT CONFINED THE FIORD LIKE ALL THE COAST OF THE PENINSULA WAS COMPOSED OF A SERIES OF VERTICAL COLUMNS THIRTY FEET HIGH
HOWEVER I AM INDIFFERENT TO THEIR INCREDULITY AND THEY MAY BELIEVE AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS THEY PLEASE
I HAVE SINCE REFLECTED UPON THIS SINGULAR PHENOMENON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT
HE TOOK THE TILLER AND UNMOORED
IF THE GROTTO OF GUACHARA IN COLOMBIA VISITED BY HUMBOLDT HAD NOT GIVEN UP THE WHOLE OF THE SECRET OF ITS DEPTH TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHO INVESTIGATED IT TO THE DEPTH OF 2,500 FEET IT PROBABLY DID NOT EXTEND MUCH FARTHER
DON'T YOU FEEL THE BURNING HEAT
THE MASS WAS COMPOSED OF INCLINED AND SOMETIMES VERTICAL STRATA
BESIDES THERE IS A PRECEDENT
IS ALL GOING ON RIGHT YES IT IS A FAIR WIND AND A FINE SEA
I WILL REPEAT IT AS SOON AS IT SHALL COME TO ME AND YOU WILL OBSERVE THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN YOU GET MY ANSWER YES
HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT
LOOK SAID MY UNCLE
CANST THOU WORK IN THE GROUND SO FAST
CLOSE BY AT NO
THAT EVENING AFTER HAVING FORDED TWO RIVERS FULL OF TROUT AND PIKE CALLED ALFA AND HETA WE WERE OBLIGED TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A DESERTED BUILDING WORTHY TO BE HAUNTED BY ALL THE ELFINS OF SCANDINAVIA
I THEREFORE CEASED TO PRESS HIM UPON THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT AND AS ABOVE ALL THINGS HE MUST BE CONVINCED I PASSED ON TO SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIONS WHICH IN MY OPINION WERE FAR MORE SERIOUS
IT RAN ROUND THE DIAL AND SPUN HITHER AND THITHER AS IF IT WERE GIDDY OR INTOXICATED
THE BEDS OF COAL WERE SEPARATED BY STRATA OF SANDSTONE OR COMPACT CLAYS AND APPEARED CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF OVERLYING STRATA
YES I AM STILL ALIVE I ANSWERED FEEBLY
BUT WHAT COULD I DO
I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER
I COULD HEAR THE SILENCE IN THE GALLERY AFTER THE DIN WHICH FOR HOURS HAD STUNNED ME
BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS
HE DREW CLOSE TO MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GENTLY WOKE HIM
I LOOKED AND CRIED
NEVER SHALL I BE ABLE TO DO IT I SAID
WE WERE OBLIGED TO LAY FAST HOLD OF THE PLANKS OF THE RAFT NOT TO BE THROWN OFF
THEY APPROACH US CLOSE
AND HE SAID
FORWARD REPLIED MY UNCLE
HELP I CRIED WITH ALL MY MIGHT
I BESTOWED A MALEDICTION UPON IT AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE THE COUNTRY
WELL THIS IS NOT MUCH LIKE ICELAND BUT IS IT JAN MAYEN I ASKED
HE HAS CONFIDED TO ME HIS PLANS HIS HOPES AND WHY AND HOW HE HOPES TO ATTAIN HIS OBJECT
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET TO ICELAND IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
ALL THOSE INGENIOUS PROFESSORIAL COMBINATIONS WERE COMING RIGHT
AND AS I HAD LANDED IN THE MIDST OF AN ACCOMPANYING TORRENT OF STONES THE LEAST OF WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO CRUSH ME THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT A LOOSE PORTION OF THE ROCK HAD COME DOWN WITH ME
THEN LIKE A CHILD I CLOSED MY EYES FIRMLY NOT TO SEE THE DARKNESS
THERE ARE NOT A FEW IN THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD WHO ENVY MY SUCCESS AND MANY WOULD BE READY TO UNDERTAKE THIS ENTERPRISE TO WHOM OUR RETURN SHOULD BE THE FIRST NEWS OF IT DO YOU REALLY THINK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE BOLD ENOUGH SAID I
THE FOLLOWING VERSION OF JULES VERNE'S JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WAS PUBLISHED BY WARD LOCK CO LTD LONDON IN 1877
GOOD HORSE HE KEPT SAYING
FARTHER ON ROSE GROUPS OF TALL TREES OF COLOURLESS FOLIAGE AND EASY TO RECOGNISE
A LIGHT BROKE IN UPON HIS SPIRIT AND MINE
BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS
NOT THAT HE COULD SPEAK FLUENTLY IN THE TWO THOUSAND LANGUAGES AND TWELVE THOUSAND DIALECTS WHICH ARE SPOKEN ON THE EARTH BUT HE KNEW AT LEAST HIS SHARE OF THEM
YOU ARE NO LONGER MY NEPHEW ONLY BUT MY COLLEAGUE
I DID SEE WITH MY OWN EYES VAST COLOSSAL FORMS MOVING AMONGST THE TREES
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE
THEY WEAR THAT IMPLACABLE LOOK WHICH I HAVE SOMETIMES NOTICED AT THE OUTBREAK OF A GREAT STORM
THE COLD WAS EXCESSIVELY KEEN
BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO RECOIL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HUNTER
I WAS POSSESSED WITH AN APPREHENSION LEST THE ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOULD GROW DIM OR FAIL ALTOGETHER
I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST YES
MY UNCLE SPOKE NOT A WORD TO ME
I COULD UNDERSTAND THEM AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF I FELT INTERESTED IN THIS LAST GEOLOGICAL STUDY
NO PROFESSOR CAME
LIEDENBROCK THEY ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
BY MID-DAY THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS WALL OF THE GALLERY
WHEN HE SAW THAT MY IMPATIENCE WAS DOING ME HARM HE YIELDED
IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO LOSE YOUR WAY IN REJKIAVIK
THE GREATER THIS ANGLE THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE DENOTED BY THE FORMATION OF THE SKULL
SAGE MIR GESCHWIND WHAT IS THIS MOUNTAIN CALLED MY LITTLE FRIEND THE CHILD MADE NO ANSWER
1 1 RATHER OF THE MAMMOTH AND THE MASTODON
IT SPLUTTERED AND FLAMED AND I RAN AT THE TOP OF MY SPEED TO THE RAFT
WHAT MATTERS REPLIED THE PHILOSOPHER WHETHER THIS OR ANOTHER SERVES TO GUIDE US I THOUGHT HIM RATHER UNGRATEFUL
AT TIMES A FEW PATCHES OF SNOW CONCENTRATING THE VAGUE LIGHT GLITTERED UPON THE SLOPES OF THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS
PICTURSSEN HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ENGAGED ON AN EPISCOPAL VISITATION IN THE NORTH
SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME
AT TEN IN THE MORNING THE SYMPTOMS OF STORM BECOME AGGRAVATED
BUT TELL ME HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET TO THE PENINSULA OF SNAEFELL BY SEA CROSSING THE BAY
BUT HANS SEEMED TO TAKE NO PART IN A QUESTION UPON WHICH DEPENDED HIS LIFE
THE MATTER THROWN OUT WAS IN VAST QUANTITIES AND THE LIQUID MATERIAL OOZING OUT FROM THE ABYSSES OF THE EARTH SLOWLY SPREAD IN EXTENSIVE PLAINS OR IN HILLOCKY MASSES
COME ON SAID HE SEIZING MY ARM
BUT CERTAIN LOCAL CONDITIONS MAY MODIFY THIS RATE
HERBACEOUS PLANTS ALONE EXISTED
HANS WALKED FIRST AS WAS HIS CUSTOM
THIS EXCURSION THROUGH THE COAL MINE LASTED TILL NIGHT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE ASCENDING THAT SCALE OF ANIMAL LIFE IN WHICH MAN FILLS THE HIGHEST PLACE
I AM EXHAUSTED
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE FOR THERE WAS NO LANDSCAPE TO VARY THE STAGES OF OUR JOURNEY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE THEORIES OF PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK A VIOLENT HEAT DID AT THAT TIME BROOD WITHIN THE BODY OF THE SPHEROID
HE GAZED UPON ME WITH HIS ARMS CROSSED
ALL THAT DAY THE PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENT MAKERS AND THE ELECTRICIANS KEPT COMING AND GOING
A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE THAT STUDY OF HIS WAS A MUSEUM AND NOTHING ELSE
FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT
THEY WERE LOWLY SHRUBS OF EARTH HERE ATTAINING GIGANTIC SIZE
JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH LUCK
BUT WHAT NEXT
1
ON ONE SIDE THE CROCODILE ON THE OTHER THE SERPENT
XXXIX
MY FEVERISH HAND HAS VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE UPON PAPER ITS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL DETAILS
BUT MY UNCLE PERSEVERED AND TOLD ME AGAINST MY WILL OF MANY THINGS I CARED NOTHING ABOUT
NO HUMAN BEING LIVES IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD
AS I HAD FORETOLD THE WATER FAILED ENTIRELY BY THE END OF THE FIRST DAY'S RETROGRADE MARCH
WE REFRESHED OURSELVES AND WENT TO SLEEP AS WELL AS WE COULD UPON A BED OF STONES AND LAVA FRAGMENTS
RUNIC INITIALS APPEAR HERE A
THE DEEPLY INDENTED SHORE WAS LINED WITH A BREADTH OF FINE SHINING SAND SOFTLY LAPPED BY THE WAVES AND STREWN WITH THE SMALL SHELLS WHICH HAD BEEN INHABITED BY THE FIRST OF CREATED BEINGS
I HAD THOUGHT I SAW--NO
AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF PULVERIZED PUMICE SAND AND DUST WAS RISING WITH A WHIRLING CIRCULAR MOTION LIKE A WATERSPOUT
STILL HE HAD JUST TAKEN A PICKAXE IN HIS HAND WHEN A SUDDEN HISSING WAS HEARD AND A JET OF WATER SPURTED OUT WITH VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPOSITE WALL
I HAD RATHER NOT DISTURB HIM WHILE HE IS QUIET
NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE
NEVER MY LAD SHALL I FORGET IT
THE DAY BEFORE IT OUR KIND FRIEND M
BAROMETER 297 IN
BUT I REMARKED SINCE WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE ROAD THAT SAKNUSSEMM HAS SHOWN US THAT IS JUST THE QUESTION
TR WELL AFTER DINNER PACK UP MY TRUNK WHAT I CRIED
THOUGH OF COURSE I TOOK CARE NOT TO SAY SO
YES INDEED THOSE ARE THE MARKS OF TEETH IMPRINTED UPON THE METAL
YOU HAVE NOW BUT A FEW HOURS TO TEMPT FORTUNE
THE BUNDLE HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A PROJECTION A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US
THE MOST PRESSING DUTY WAS TO FIND OUT AGAIN THE COURSE OF THE HANSBACH
DID HE WANT TO REDUCE US BY FAMINE
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY BECAUSE WE DON'T POSSESS A SINGLE BOAT AT REJKIAVIK YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO YOU WILL HAVE TO GO BY LAND FOLLOWING THE SHORE
THAT GOOD MAN WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT HIS ENERGY
THUS IT HAPPENED THAT THE PICTURE OF MY PRETTY VIRLANDAISE THREW ME IN A MOMENT OUT OF THE WORLD OF REALITIES INTO THAT OF MEMORY AND FANCY
HE LET ME HOLD THEM AND LOOKED AT ME
HE HAS UTTERED A FEW WORDS
YOU SEE AXEL HE ADDED THE CONDITION OF THE TERRESTRIAL NUCLEUS HAS GIVEN RISE TO VARIOUS HYPOTHESES AMONG GEOLOGISTS
THE RECTOR DID NOT TO GO IN FOR ANTIQUE HOSPITALITY
THEREFORE IF THESE VAPOURS REMAIN IN THEIR USUAL CONDITION IF THEY DISPLAY NO AUGMENTATION OF FORCE AND IF YOU ADD TO THIS THE OBSERVATION THAT THE WIND AND RAIN ARE NOT CEASING AND BEING REPLACED BY A STILL AND HEAVY ATMOSPHERE THEN YOU MAY AFFIRM THAT NO ERUPTION IS PREPARING BUT NO MORE
AN ANEROID BAROMETER TO INDICATE EXTREME PRESSURES OF THE ATMOSPHERE
MY UNCLE HOWEVER WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED AND HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AT THE STEEPNESS OF THE DESCENT
WE MUST GO BACK ON OUR WAY TO SNAEFELL
THAT AFTER ALL HE MIGHT HIMSELF DISCOVER THE KEY OF THE CIPHER AND THAT THEN I SHOULD BE CLEAR AT THE MERE EXPENSE OF MY INVOLUNTARY ABSTINENCE
I SAT NEAR THE WALL WHILE THE WATERS WERE FLOWING PAST ME AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FEET WITH EXTREME VIOLENCE
HE WAS LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE MURMUR OF DISTANT SPRINGS
HE BAITED IT WITH A SMALL PIECE OF MEAT AND FLUNG IT INTO THE SEA
MIGHT NOT SOME LIVING MAN SOME NATIVE OF THE ABYSS BE YET A WANDERER BELOW ON THIS DESERT STRAND
BUT NO PARTICULAR SIGN APPEARED AND I SOON SAW THAT THIS GALLERY COULD NOT BRING ME BACK TO THE TURNING POINT
NO I STAMMERED
THE ABSURDEST NOTIONS RAN IN UTTER CONFUSION THROUGH MY MIND
UNPLEASANT THEORIES
I I CONFESS WITH COMPLAINTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF DESPAIR
NEVER THEN MUST WE RESIGN OURSELVES TO DESTRUCTION NO AXEL NO
GRANITE STILL
TO LIGHT A TORCH UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
EASTWARD LAY A PRETTY LITTLE WHITE SEAPORT TOWN OR VILLAGE WITH A FEW HOUSES SCATTERED AROUND IT AND IN THE HARBOUR OF WHICH A FEW VESSELS OF PECULIAR RIG WERE GENTLY SWAYED BY THE SOFTLY SWELLING WAVES
THE CLOUDS ARE SINKING LOWER AND ASSUME AN OLIVE HUE
IN FALLING MY LAMP HAD GOT WRONG
NOW TO A MAN EMINENT FOR HIS LEARNING AN UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON IS AN UNBEARABLE HARDSHIP
ITS DOUBLE CONE FORMS THE LIMIT OF A TRACHYTIC BELT WHICH STANDS OUT DISTINCTLY IN THE MOUNTAIN SYSTEM OF THE ISLAND
S SHOUTED MY UNCLE
OUR OLD SERVANT WAS AT HER WITS END
WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS
JUST LOOK ADDED MY UNCLE THROWING INTO THE SEA ONE OF THOSE PRECIOUS WAIFS
DON'T SPEAK
1 RECHERCHE WAS SENT OUT IN 1835 BY ADMIRAL DUPERRE TO LEARN THE FATE OF THE LOST EXPEDITION OF M
A SMALL DANISH SCHOONER THE VALKYRIA WAS TO SET SAIL FOR REJKIAVIK ON THE 2ND OF JUNE
A BATTLE OF MONSTERS SATURDAY AUGUST 15_.--THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND
THE RUNIC CHARACTERS IN CHAPTER III ARE VISIBLE IN THE HTML VERSION OF THE TEXT
WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I WAS STRETCHED IN HALF DARKNESS COVERED WITH THICK COATS AND BLANKETS
I HAD NO TIME TO GET TIRED OF THE MONOTONY
THAT CANNOT BE DIFFICULT AT THESE WORDS I QUICKLY RAISED MY HEAD
THE PLANTS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE BENEFICENT INFLUENCES OF THE SUN YIELDED NEITHER FLOWERS NOR SCENT
WELL I CANNOT STAND IT ANY LONGER I REPLIED
SERIOUSLY I HAD
COME ON AND AFTER DINNER 1 IN THE CIPHER AUDAX IS WRITTEN AVDAS AND QUOD AND QUEM HOD AND KEN
NOT TO BE SURE WHEN HE WAS TALKING AT HOME BUT CERTAINLY IN HIS PUBLIC DELIVERY
HE CAME AND HE WENT
OFVANFOER IT SEEMS WE MUST GO HIGHER SAID MY UNCLE
NEVERTHELESS MY GOOD UNCLE WAS A MAN OF DEEP LEARNING--A FACT I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO ASSERT AND REASSERT
OUR BUSINESS IS NOT TO EXPLAIN FACTS BUT TO USE THEM CERTAINLY
IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
I COULD SEE AN ENORMOUS CAP OF SNOW COMING LOW DOWN UPON THE GIANT'S BROW
OUR PRINCIPLE IS THAT BOOKS INSTEAD OF GROWING MOULDY BEHIND AN IRON GRATING SHOULD BE WORN OUT UNDER THE EYES OF MANY READERS
OUR ROUTE LAY AMIDST ERUPTIVE ROCKS SOME OF WHICH SHAKEN OUT OF THEIR LOOSENED BEDS RUSHED BOUNDING DOWN THE ABYSS AND IN THEIR FALL AWOKE ECHOES REMARKABLE FOR THEIR LOUD AND WELL-DEFINED SHARPNESS
BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS HE ANSWERED CRUMPLING UP THE PAPER
I COULD SEE DEEP VALLEYS INTERSECTING EACH OTHER IN EVERY DIRECTION PRECIPICES LIKE LOW WALLS LAKES REDUCED TO PONDS RIVERS ABBREVIATED INTO STREAMS
UNTIL THE PRESENT TIME WE HAD SEEN ALIVE ONLY MARINE MONSTERS AND FISHES
AT LAST HE DISCERNED A STRETCH OF SEA
NO SIGNS OF WATER HAD YET APPEARED
THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE
THE EIGHTY-THIRD AND TWO FOLLOWING MADE SIR
SUBLIME MADMAN I SAID NO DOUBT YOU WOULD APPROVE OF OUR EXPEDITION
DID SAKNUSSEMM MEET THIS SHEET OF WATER
FAERJA SAID THE GUIDE TOUCHING HIS SHOULDER
I MADE A MOVEMENT INTENDED TO EXPRESS RESIGNATION
I FELT THAT A CATASTROPHE WAS APPROACHING BEFORE WHICH THE BOLDEST SPIRIT MUST QUAIL
BUT AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE CRATER THESE NATIVES WERE TO TURN BACK AND LEAVE US TO OUR OWN DEVICES
IT MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED WHAT VAST QUANTITIES OF ELASTIC GASES WHAT MASSES OF MOLTEN MATTER ACCUMULATED BENEATH ITS SOLID SURFACE WHILST NO EXIT WAS PRACTICABLE AFTER THE COOLING OF THE TRACHYTIC CRUST
ALTHOUGH I WAS CERTAIN THAT WE WERE NOW TREADING UPON A SOIL NOT HITHERTO TOUCHED BY OUR FEET I OFTEN PERCEIVED GROUPS OF ROCKS WHICH REMINDED ME OF THOSE ABOUT PORT GRAEUBEN
HE DID NOT LOOK LIKELY TO FRIGHTEN HIS GAME NOR DID HE SEEM AS IF HE WOULD EVEN GET NEAR IT
HERE WE ARE TRAVELLING ALL THROUGH A MOST INTERESTING COUNTRY
PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK SEEMED TO BE GREATLY ABSTRACTED
AXEL
AXEL
AXEL
AXEL
I AM GOING TO CALL YOUR NAME I PUT MY EAR TO THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THE NAME AXEL CAME I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED AXEL THEN WAITED
IT SHALL NOT BE I DECLARED ENERGETICALLY
MARCH ALL THIS CRAZY TALK WAS GOING ON STILL WHEN WE MET THE HUNTER
AT ANY RATE SOME LEAGUES TO THE WINDWARD THERE MUST BE SOME NOISY PHENOMENON FOR NOW THE ROARINGS ARE HEARD WITH INCREASING LOUDNESS
AN INHABITANT OF THAT PENINSULA
IS IT REALLY
ALL AT ONCE I COULD HEAR
HIS MANNERS WERE A SINGULAR CONTRAST WITH MY UNCLE'S
IN AN HOUR MY UNCLE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR PROGRESS
THERE IS NOTHING MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THIS ATTRACTION DOWN DEEP ABYSSES
BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP AND I COUNTED EVERY HOUR UNTIL MORNING
TO READ THE DOCUMENT IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE NECESSARY TO READ IT THROUGH THE PAPER
I AM QUITE CONVINCED ALTHOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLE BY NEXT EVENING THANKS TO THE INDUSTRY AND SKILL OF OUR GUIDE THE RAFT WAS MADE
I AM THE COLUMBUS OF THIS NETHER WORLD AND I ONLY ASK FOR ONE MORE DAY
BUT THE PASSAGE WAS EFFECTED WITHOUT ANY MISHAP
FAHR
FAHR
IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS IMMANIOR IPSE
FAHR FOR EVERY HUNDRED FEET
THE STRANGE CHANCES OF OUR EXPEDITION HAD CARRIED US INTO THE HEART OF THE FAIREST REGION IN THE WORLD
HANS WITH THE RESIGNATION OF HIS PASSIVE NATURE
WE ARE NOW AMONG THE PRIMITIVE ROCKS UPON WHICH THE CHEMICAL OPERATIONS TOOK PLACE WHICH ARE PRODUCED BY THE CONTACT OF ELEMENTARY BASES OF METALS WITH WATER
SO GET UP AND BEGIN WALKING
HE APPLIED HIS EAR AGAINST THE DRY STONE AND MOVED IT SLOWLY TO AND FRO LISTENING INTENTLY
I WAS NO LONGER SENSIBLE OF MY FATIGUE
NOW WE ARE IN THE RIGHT WAY
I FOUND HIM SHOUTING--AND WORKING HIMSELF UP AMIDST A CROWD OF PORTERS AND MESSENGERS WHO WERE ALL DEPOSITING VARIOUS LOADS IN THE PASSAGE
AT HALF-PAST FIVE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF WHEELS OUTSIDE
THEN ALL THE LIGHT DISAPPEARS
THEY ARE QUITE NATURAL BUT SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD WRAP US ROUND BUT THEY WON'T WRAP US ROUND BUT WE SHALL BE STIFLED WE SHALL NOT BE STIFLED AT ALL
AXEL SHE CRIED SURPRISED
I FORGOT EVERYTHING
THE FIRST OF THOSE MONSTERS HAS A PORPOISE'S SNOUT A LIZARD'S HEAD A CROCODILE'S TEETH
AND I WAS NOW ABLE TO SPEAK
EVERYTHING SEEMED MIXED-UP AND CONFOUNDED IN ONE UNIFORM SILVER GREY OR LIGHT BROWN TINT LIKE THAT OF FADING AND FADED LEAVES
THE HEAT WAS INCREASING IN A MANNER TO CAUSE US THE MOST FEARFUL ANXIETY AND CERTAINLY THE TEMPERATURE WAS AT THIS MOMENT AT THE HEIGHT OF 100 DEG
INSTEAD OF RUDIMENTARY TRILOBITES I NOTICED REMAINS OF A MORE PERFECT ORDER OF BEINGS AMONGST OTHERS GANOID FISHES AND SOME OF THOSE SAUROIDS IN WHICH PALAEONTOLOGISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE EARLIEST REPTILE FORMS
THE FEMALE THEREFORE LAYS HER EGGS IN THE SPOILS OF HER MATE THE YOUNG ARE HATCHED AND NEXT YEAR THE HARVEST BEGINS AGAIN
HOW HAPPY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COULD I HAVE DIED AND IF DEATH WERE NOT YET TO BE GONE THROUGH
BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW-HEADS WHICH ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STONE AGE
SUCH AN EXPEDIENT HOWEVER SIMPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED INTO OUR MINDS
A MORTAL MAN HAD HAD THE AUDACITY TO PENETRATE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE
WHAT AM I TO BELIEVE
THERE LOOKED DOWN UPON ME THE FAITHFUL COMPANION OF MY LABOURS AND MY RECREATIONS
NO DOUBT IN THE POST-TERTIARY PERIOD CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH
ARMED WITH HIS HAMMER HIS STEEL POINTER HIS MAGNETIC NEEDLES HIS BLOWPIPE AND HIS BOTTLE OF NITRIC ACID HE WAS A POWERFUL MAN OF SCIENCE
I DISMISSED FROM MY MIND THE PAST PERILS OF THE JOURNEY THE FUTURE DANGER OF OUR RETURN
IT WAS EFFECTED IN PROFOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE DESCENT OF LOOSENED STONES DOWN THE DARK GULF
SCARCELY HAS HE LIFTED HIS HEAD AGAIN BEFORE A BALL OF FIRE HAS BOUNDED OVER THE WAVES AND LIGHTED ON BOARD OUR RAFT
ROPES COULD NOT HOLD HIM SUCH A DETERMINED GEOLOGIST AS HE IS
FORUET WAS HIS TRANQUIL ANSWER
I HAVE BUT TO ASCEND STILL
WE HAD PASSED THE LIMIT OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOISTURE OF THE CLIMATE IS AT A GREATER ELEVATION IN ICELAND THAN THE HIGH LATITUDE WOULD GIVE REASON TO SUPPOSE
BUT WHETHER IT BE THE HAND OF NATURE OR NOT DOES NOT MATTER
MY DEAR AXEL SHE SAID
BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE GLOOM UPON THEM DEEPENS
I WILL NOT PLAY BY THE WAY I IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL
WE ARE SAVED I CRIED
WE WENT ON A HUNDRED YARDS WITHOUT SPEAKING
I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR DREAMING ABOUT ERUPTIONS
ERUPTIVE GRANITE HE WAS SAYING
IT GIVES US TIME NOW AND THEN TO TAKE BREATH THIS WAS PERFECTLY TRUE
WELL HE REPLIED HOW DOES THAT MAKE AGAINST MY DOCTRINE OH NOTHING AT ALL I SAID SEEING THAT I WAS GOING IN OPPOSITION TO IMMOVABLE OBSTINACY
FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL
THE KEEN AIR MADE ME GIDDY
SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA
NO DOUBT IT IS A GEYSER LIKE THOSE IN ICELAND AT FIRST I PROTEST AGAINST BEING SO WIDELY MISTAKEN AS TO HAVE TAKEN AN ISLAND FOR A MARINE MONSTER
THIS TOOK HALF AN HOUR FOR THE STATION IS OUT OF THE TOWN
WHILST HANS WAS AT WORK I WAS ACTIVELY HELPING MY UNCLE TO PREPARE A SLOW MATCH OF WETTED POWDER ENCASED IN LINEN
AFTER HIM HIS WIFE PRONOUNCED THE SAME WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH THE SAME CEREMONIAL
I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS
NINE TIMES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET GIVES A DEPTH OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE FEET VERY ACCURATE INDEED WELL BY MY OBSERVATION WE ARE AT 10,000 FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE SEA IS THAT POSSIBLE YES OR FIGURES ARE OF NO USE THE PROFESSOR'S CALCULATIONS WERE QUITE CORRECT
STILL I HAD ONE HOPE LEFT AND THIS WAS THAT WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR WANT OF A PASSAGE TO GO DEEPER IN SPITE OF ALL THE SAKNUSSEMM'S IN ICELAND
THERE WAS A QUIVERING IN HIS FINGERS AS HE GRASPED THE OLD PARCHMENT
I WAS EXHAUSTED
I WAS EXHAUSTED
ITS WIDTH COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED SINCE THE SHORE RAN WIDENING AS FAR AS EYE COULD REACH NOR COULD ITS LENGTH FOR THE DIM HORIZON BOUNDED THE NEW
WE WERE LIKE HOFFMANN'S SHADOWLESS MAN
IT WAS CONCEIVED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
BUT IT WAS QUITE ANOTHER THING TO GET TO THE END OF THIS CRYPTOGRAM WITH SO SMALL A CLUE
AH SAID MY UNCLE BETWEEN HIS CLENCHED TEETH YOU ARE AFRAID
AS FOR ME THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF LEAVING THE HOUSE DISTRESSED ME A GOOD DEAL MORE AND FOR A VERY GOOD REASON
LET IT BE CALLED PORT GRAEUBEN
WELL I SAID DO AS YOU WILL AND GOD REWARD YOUR SUPERHUMAN ENERGY
BUT WHETHER HE LIKED IT OR NOT THIS WAS A REST AS WELL AS A BREAKFAST HOUR AND HE HAD TO WAIT TILL IT PLEASED OUR GUIDE TO MOVE ON WHICH CAME TO PASS IN AN HOUR
ON AWAKING MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO OBSERVE THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT
WHAT PLEASANT HOURS WE HAVE SPENT IN STUDY
WE HAVE NO FIREARMS
HE WAS RIGHT AS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LETTERS
THUS AT YAKOUTSK IN SIBERIA THE INCREASE OF A DEGREE IS ASCERTAINED TO BE REACHED EVERY 36 FEET
DINNER IS READY I AM AFRAID HE SENT THAT SOUP TO WHERE IT WOULD BOIL AWAY TO NOTHING AND MARTHA TOOK TO HER HEELS FOR SAFETY
AND THE INFLAMMATION OF MY LIPS ABATED SOMEWHAT
IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY OTHER DISCOVERER WILL EVER DISPUTE MY CLAIM TO NAME IT AFTER MYSELF AS ITS FIRST DISCOVERER A VAST SHEET OF WATER THE COMMENCEMENT OF A LAKE OR AN OCEAN SPREAD FAR AWAY BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE EYE REMINDING ME FORCIBLY OF THAT OPEN SEA WHICH DREW FROM XENOPHON'S TEN THOUSAND GREEKS AFTER THEIR LONG RETREAT THE SIMULTANEOUS CRY THALATTA
AND THERE WE WERE ALONE IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AT THE MERCY OF ITS WILD INHABITANTS
AND SHE WAS DRIVING ME TO IT ONE WHOM SHE LOVED
IN HIS HAND HE WIELDED WITH EASE AN ENORMOUS BOUGH A STAFF WORTHY OF THIS SHEPHERD OF THE GEOLOGIC PERIOD
I LOOKED AT THE HUNTER
TRANS WHY BECAUSE ANIMAL LIFE EXISTED UPON THE EARTH ONLY IN THE SECONDARY PERIOD WHEN A SEDIMENT OF SOIL HAD BEEN DEPOSITED BY THE RIVERS AND TAKEN THE PLACE OF THE INCANDESCENT ROCKS OF THE PRIMITIVE PERIOD WELL AXEL THERE IS A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR OBJECTION THAT THIS SOIL IS ALLUVIAL WHAT
IF I LOOKED WESTWARD THERE THE OCEAN LAY SPREAD OUT IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE LIKE A MERE CONTINUATION OF THOSE FLOCK-LIKE SUMMITS
AND IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT IF WE WERE TO REACH THE SPOT BENEATH THE POLAR REGIONS ABOUT THAT SEVENTY-FIRST DEGREE WHERE SIR JAMES ROSS HAS DISCOVERED THE MAGNETIC POLE TO BE SITUATED WE SHOULD SEE THE NEEDLE POINT STRAIGHT UP
OR WAS IT A MISTAKE
NEVER MY OVER-EXCITEMENT WAS BEYOND ALL DESCRIPTION
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT
THE ARMS ARE ALL RIGHT BUT THE LEGS WANT EXERCISE WE WERE ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE
HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR BEING IMPATIENT
BUT THAT WORD I WOULD NOT SPEAK
NO LIGHT COULD PENETRATE BETWEEN THEIR HUGE CONES AND COMPLETE DARKNESS REIGNED BENEATH THOSE GIANTS
I HAD NO SPIRIT TO OPPOSE THIS ILL FORTUNE
AS FOR A PASSAGE LEADING TO THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE IT IS MERE RUBBISH
WITHOUT KNOWING DANISH I UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT WE MUST FOLLOW HANS AT THE TOP OF OUR SPEED
AND YET NOW THAT I CAN REFLECT QUIETLY NOW THAT MY SPIRIT HAS GROWN CALM AGAIN NOW THAT MONTHS HAVE SLIPPED BY SINCE THIS STRANGE AND SUPERNATURAL MEETING WHAT AM I TO THINK
AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY GAITERS I STOOD THUNDERSTRUCK
DID IT NOT BELONG TO SOME PRE-ADAMITE WARRIOR I CRIED TO SOME LIVING MAN CONTEMPORARY WITH THE HUGE CATTLE-DRIVER
DON'T YOU SEE HOW THE WATER BOILS AND BUBBLES
THESE METALS KINDLED WHEN THE ATMOSPHERIC VAPOURS FELL IN RAIN UPON THE SOIL
SO I WAS STRUGGLING WITH AN INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTY
WE KEPT OUR BACKS TO THE WIND NOT TO BE STIFLED BY THE RAPIDITY OF A MOVEMENT WHICH NO HUMAN POWER COULD CHECK
I SHALL GET CRAMPED IF I DON'T HAVE A LITTLE ACTION
HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE TO HAVE FOUND THIS BOAT READY FOR SAILING
FAMINE THEN VICTORY FOLLOWED BY DISMAY I HAD ONLY JUST TIME TO REPLACE THE UNFORTUNATE DOCUMENT UPON THE TABLE
YOU MUST ASK ME NO MORE QUESTIONS UNTIL THE 10TH IN TRUTH I WAS VERY WEAK AND MY EYES INVOLUNTARILY CLOSED
AT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM GARDAER THE SOIL BEGAN TO CHANGE ITS ASPECT
I TRIED TO SPEAK ALOUD BUT HOARSE SOUNDS ALONE PASSED MY DRY LIPS
SOMETIMES HE WOULD HALT PICK UP A FEW BITS OF STONE BUILD THEM UP INTO A RECOGNISABLE FORM AND THUS MADE LANDMARKS TO GUIDE US IN OUR WAY BACK
THE DESERT BECAME WIDER AND MORE HIDEOUS
XXV DE PROFUNDIS XXVI THE WORST PERIL OF ALL XXVII LOST IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH XXVIII THE RESCUE IN THE WHISPERING GALLERY XXIX THALATTA
MY UNCLE OPENED IT AND SAID
NO HUMAN EYE HAS EVER BEHELD THEM LIVING
ON THE 28TH OF MARCH 1863 SOME EXCAVATORS WORKING UNDER THE DIRECTION OF M
WHAT WAS MY SURPRISE WHEN IN ONE OF THOSE RAPID REVOLUTIONS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE BACK WAS TURNED TO ME I THOUGHT I CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE LATIN WORDS CRATEREM TERRESTRE AND OTHERS
THE WORD FORLORAD AGAIN RETURNED
AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE PASSING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE DINING-ROOM THREW HIMSELF IN HASTE INTO HIS OWN SANCTUM
THE TORTOISE IS A CHELONIAN A REPTILE DISTINCT CLASSES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
HE HAD BROUGHT ALL THE RESOURCES OF HIS MIND TO BEAR UPON IT DURING HIS WALK AND HE HAD COME BACK TO APPLY SOME NEW COMBINATION
IMMEDIATELY THE ICELANDER CLIMBED UP LIKE A CAT AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE PACKAGE WAS IN OUR POSSESSION
BUT THERE ARE SOME CHANCES OF DELIVERANCE AND IT IS THESE THAT I AM CONSIDERING
I WILL KEEP THE SECRET WHICH MERE CHANCE HAS REVEALED TO ME
HE WOULD REFER ANY MINERAL TO ITS PROPER PLACE AMONG THE SIX HUNDRED 1 ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES NOW ENUMERATED BY ITS FRACTURE ITS APPEARANCE ITS HARDNESS ITS FUSIBILITY ITS SONOROUSNESS ITS SMELL AND ITS TASTE
IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM WHICH DIMINISHES THE FACIAL ANGLE
ISN'T IT A BEAUTY
THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THIS LIGHT ITS TREMBLING DIFFUSIVENESS ITS BRIGHT CLEAR WHITENESS AND ITS LOW TEMPERATURE SHOWED THAT IT MUST BE OF ELECTRIC ORIGIN
AXEL SAID HE VERY MILDLY
ANTEDILUVIAN THESE CORRECTIONS HAVE KINDLY BEEN POINTED OUT BY CHRISTIAN SANCHEZ <CHVSANCHEZ@ARNET.COM.AR> OF THE JULES VERNE FORUM
NOW LET US HAVE SOME BREAKFAST AND GO ABOUT THE TOWN WE WENT FIRST TO KONGENS-NYE-TORW AN IRREGULAR SQUARE IN WHICH ARE TWO INNOCENT-LOOKING GUNS WHICH NEED NOT ALARM ANY ONE
GRAEUBEN WAS FAR AWAY
THE MOMENT DREW NEAR TO CLEAR A WAY BY BLASTING THROUGH THE OPPOSING MASS OF GRANITE
IN THE HEART OF A VOLCANO AND FROM THE DEEPEST DEPTHS OF THE EARTH I SAW MYSELF TOSSED UP AMONGST THE INTERPLANETARY SPACES UNDER THE FORM OF AN ERUPTIVE ROCK
YOU DO
YET I SLEPT PARTICULARLY WELL
HOW LONG WILL THE PASSAGE TAKE MY UNCLE ASKED
HAVE WE FOLLOWED THAT ROAD
I MUST BE BOUND TO THE MAST WHICH BOWS LIKE A REED BEFORE THE MIGHTY STRENGTH OF THE STORM
NOT FAR OFF IN THE GRASS UNDER THE DELICIOUS SHADE OF THE TREES I DISCOVERED A SPRING OF FRESH COOL WATER IN WHICH WE LUXURIOUSLY BATHED OUR FACES HANDS AND FEET
MY UNCLE'S HAND AND THE VIGOROUS ARM OF HANS HELD ME FAST
HAS NOT THIS SAKNUSSEMM CONCEALED UNDER HIS CRYPTOGRAM SOME SURPRISING INVENTION
HUNGER AND FATIGUE MADE ME INCAPABLE OF REASONING
THEN MY UNCLE AFTER A HASTY TOILET DRAGGED ME AFTER HIM
NOW WE MUST SEE WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT OF THAT AXEL
BUT THEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE THE PLAY OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT PRODUCED SINGULAR EFFECTS UPON THE UPPER STRATA OF CLOUD
FOR EVEN IF THE JOURNEY OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER WERE REALLY ATTESTED THERE WAS ONE VERY SIMPLE ANSWER THAT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS NEITHER BAROMETER OR ANEROID AND THEREFORE SAKNUSSEMM COULD NOT TELL HOW FAR HE HAD GONE
TRUE IT SEEMED MOST HAZARDOUS TO STRIKE A BLOW OF THE HAMMER IN THIS PART OF THE EARTH'S STRUCTURE
VERY WELL SAID MY UNCLE
THE SLOPE OF THE VOLCANO WAS IN MANY PLACES OF GREAT STEEPNESS
HANS PULLED THE ROPE BY ONE OF ITS ENDS THE OTHER ROSE IN THE AIR
LET US SAY IN ROUND NUMBERS 1,600 LEAGUES OR 4,800 MILES
THESE EJACULATIONS BROUGHT TO MY MIND THE FACT THAT MY UNCLE WAS LIABLE TO OCCASIONAL FITS OF BIBLIOMANIA
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF MY COMPANIONS THE MOMENT THEY TOUCHED ME WOULD RECEIVE A SEVERE SHOCK LIKE THAT FROM AN ELECTRIC EEL
MY CURIOSITY WAS HIGHLY EXCITED MY UNCLE VAINLY TRIED TO RESTRAIN ME
IT IS NOT THROUGH SUCH A MASS THAT A VOICE CAN BE HEARD
FINALLY THE LAST STRAP WAS BUCKLED
FOR THREE LONG HOURS MY UNCLE WORKED ON WITHOUT A WORD WITHOUT LIFTING HIS HEAD
BUT THERE WAS A DREARY SILENCE IN ALL THAT LONG GALLERY
DO YOU SEE REJKIAVIK THE CAPITAL
AFTER A MODERATE DRAUGHT HE WENT QUIETLY INTO A CORNER TO REST
YOU MADMAN
AS SOON AS THE MEAL WAS OVER THE CHILDREN DISAPPEARED AND THEIR ELDERS GATHERED ROUND THE PEAT FIRE WHICH ALSO BURNT SUCH MISCELLANEOUS FUEL AS BRIARS COW-DUNG AND FISHBONES
HE ROSE AND TOOK THE LAMP
NEVER WAS BARGAIN MORE READILY CONCLUDED
THE DAY FOR OUR DEPARTURE ARRIVED
ON A MORE DISTANT COAST AROSE A PRODIGIOUS CONE CROWNED ON ITS SUMMIT WITH A SNOWY PLUME OF WHITE CLOUD
YOU ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS
WHAT A JOURNEY WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED
LET US START I CRIED AWAKENING BY MY SHOUTS THE ECHOES OF THE VAULTED HOLLOWS OF THE EARTH
BOGS DEAD LEVELS MELANCHOLY DESERT TRACKS WHEREVER WE TRAVELLED
AT LAST WE LEAVE THE ISLAND ROUNDING AWAY PAST THE LOW ROCKS ON ITS SOUTHERN SHORE
I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS ASTONISHING AND THAT I FEEL I HAVE NO WAY TO EXPLAIN IT WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY UNCLE
HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA--FORWARD
AT EIGHT IN THE EVENING WE ARE NOT TWO LEAGUES DISTANT FROM IT
IS NOT THE VOYAGE PROSPERING AS FAVOURABLY AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE SO TALL A MAN ON SO SMALL A PONY AND AS HIS LONG LEGS NEARLY TOUCHED THE GROUND HE LOOKED LIKE A SIX-LEGGED CENTAUR
THE WATER IS SPLASHED FOR A LONG WAY AROUND
I THINK IT IMPORTANT TO LET THESE STRANGE SIGNS BE PUBLICLY KNOWN FOR THEY WERE THE MEANS OF DRAWING ON PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK AND HIS NEPHEW TO UNDERTAKE THE MOST WONDERFUL EXPEDITION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BUT I KNOW THAT HER HAND DID NOT TREMBLE IN MINE
FOR THE ELASTIC FLUIDS BEING NO LONGER UNDER PRESSURE GO OFF BY WAY OF THE CRATER INSTEAD OF ESCAPING BY THEIR USUAL PASSAGES THROUGH THE FISSURES IN THE SOIL
AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE BASALTIC WALL OF THE FIORD OF STAPI WE PASSED OVER A VEGETABLE FIBROUS PEAT BOG LEFT FROM THE ANCIENT VEGETATION OF THIS PENINSULA
I HAVE EVERYWHERE OBSERVED THE ANGLES AND THE INCLINES
I WAS TO REGISTER EVERY OBSERVATION MAKE ENTRIES OF INTERESTING PHENOMENA THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND THE RATE OF SAILING THE WAY WE MADE--IN A WORD EVERY PARTICULAR OF OUR SINGULAR VOYAGE
AFTER MY FALL I HAD LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD
LET US HAVE OUR SUPPER AND GO TO SLEEP THE DARKNESS WAS NOT YET COMPLETE
THE UNDULATING SURFACE OF THESE ENDLESS MOUNTAINS CRESTED WITH SHEETS OF SNOW REMINDED ONE OF A STORMY SEA
THE OPEN AIR MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU OPEN AIR YES
GOOD HORSE
SO I FELT REASSURED AS FAR AS REGARDED THIS HEROIC METHOD OF SOLVING THE DIFFICULTY
THIS IS THE ICELANDIC ORIGINAL IN THE MAGNIFICENT IDIOMATIC VERNACULAR WHICH IS BOTH RICH AND SIMPLE AND ADMITS OF AN INFINITE VARIETY OF GRAMMATICAL COMBINATIONS AND VERBAL MODIFICATIONS LIKE GERMAN I HAPPILY VENTURED
WE ARE THERE HE CRIED
BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET US EVER SEPARATE AGAIN OR WE MANY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER MORE NOT SEPARATE
WE RAISED THE BODY
THE PROFESSOR STOOD CHRONOMETER IN HAND
IN APRIL AFTER HE HAD PLANTED IN THE TERRA-COTTA POTS OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW SEEDLING PLANTS OF MIGNONETTE AND CONVOLVULUS HE WOULD GO AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE PULL BY THEIR LEAVES TO MAKE THEM GROW FASTER
I WANTED TO SHOUT BUT MY VOICE DIED UPON MY PARCHED AND SWOLLEN LIPS
I RETURN TO THE SCRIPTURAL PERIODS OR AGES OF THE WORLD CONVENTIONALLY CALLED DAYS LONG BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF MAN WHEN THE UNFINISHED WORLD WAS AS YET UNFITTED FOR HIS SUPPORT
I RETURN TO THE SCRIPTURAL PERIODS OR AGES OF THE WORLD CONVENTIONALLY CALLED DAYS LONG BEFORE THE APPEARANCE OF MAN WHEN THE UNFINISHED WORLD WAS AS YET UNFITTED FOR HIS SUPPORT
I RETRACED MY STEPS
THE CURATOR OF THIS CURIOUS ESTABLISHMENT IN WHICH WONDERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER OUT OF WHICH THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY MIGHT BE RECONSTRUCTED BY MEANS OF ITS STONE WEAPONS ITS CUPS AND ITS JEWELS WAS A LEARNED SAVANT THE FRIEND OF THE DANISH CONSUL AT HAMBURG PROFESSOR THOMSEN
AFTER AN EXAMINATION I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO STAND LAST OF THE FORTY SCHOLARS EDUCATED AT THIS LITTLE COLLEGE AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD UNWORTHY TO SLEEP ALONG WITH THEM IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE DOUBLE CLOSETS WHERE MORE DELICATE YOUTHS WOULD HAVE DIED OF SUFFOCATION THE VERY FIRST NIGHT
STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING
THE STORM CONTINUES TO ROAR AND RAGE
WHEN THE WIND LULLED A DEEPER SILENCE THAN THAT OF THE DESERTS FELL UPON THE ARID NAKED ROCKS AND WEIGHED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
LYCOPODIUMS A HUNDRED FEET HIGH
THE GEYSER A WORD MEANING FURY RISES MAJESTICALLY FROM ITS EXTREMITY
I STROVE WITH HIM
MY UNCLE LEFT IN HASTE HIS FLOATING PRISON OR RATHER HOSPITAL
THIS BLADE HAS BEEN LEFT ON THE STRAND FOR FROM ONE TO THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND HAS BLUNTED ITS EDGE UPON THE ROCKS THAT FRINGE THIS SUBTERRANEAN SEA BUT IT HAS NOT COME ALONE
AHA CLEVER SAKNUSSEMM HE CRIED
GREENLAND I CRIED
WHILST THESE REFLECTIONS WERE OCCUPYING ME PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD LAUNCHED INTO A SOMEWHAT RHAPSODICAL EULOGIUM OF WHICH ARNE SAKNUSSEMM WAS OF COURSE THE HERO
THE RECTOR REPEATED THE PROFESSOR
HE PUSHED THE CHAIRS OUT OF THEIR PLACES HE PILED UP HIS BOOKS
SPARKS OF ELECTRIC FIRE MINGLE WITH THE DAZZLING SHEAF OF LIGHTED FLUID EVERY DROP OF WHICH REFRACTS THE PRISMATIC COLOURS
IT WILL SOON BE OVER AXEL MUST I GO UP OR DOWN DOWN--FOR THIS REASON
HOWEVER MUCH I MIGHT RESPECT THE INTELLIGENCE OF OUR QUADRUPEDS I HARDLY CARED TO PUT IT TO THE TEST BY TRUSTING MYSELF TO IT ON HORSEBACK ACROSS AN ARM OF THE SEA
AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT AND WE ARE NINE HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM REJKIAVIK WE HAVE NOW THE MEDITERRANEAN ABOVE OUR HEAD THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND
I LISTENED STILL
AT THE WORST WE ARE GOING TO SCRAMBLE DOWN AN EXTINCT CRATER
1 MEASURE THAT ANGLE
I FOUND MYSELF LYING ON THE SLOPING SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN ONLY TWO YARDS FROM A GAPING GULF WHICH WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED ME UP HAD I LEANED AT ALL THAT WAY
THERE OUR HORSES WERE BAITED
I PREPARE TO FIRE
FOUR MILES OUT OF TWENTY-EIGHT
I KEPT DRINKING WITHOUT STOPPING AND ALMOST WITHOUT TASTING
UNCLE IS IT TRUE THAT WE ARE TO GO WHY DO YOU DOUBT WELL I DON'T DOUBT I SAID NOT TO VEX HIM
AND THIS IS ALL I CAN REMEMBER OF THIS FIRST PORTION OF OUR SAIL
I GAVE A MORE AFFIRMATIVE GESTURE
AT LEAST I SAID DON'T LET US LOSE A MINUTE YES YES LAD HE REPLIED
YET I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD BEEN CONVINCED ALTHOUGH NOW MY ENTHUSIASM WAS BEGINNING TO COOL DOWN
AT LAST I BECAME MORE CALM
FRIDRIKSSEN SHOOK HANDS WITH US
THE WORD FORLORAD WAS SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED IN A TONE OF SYMPATHY AND SORROW
IT WAS QUITE AN OCEAN WITH THE IRREGULAR SHORES OF EARTH BUT DESERT AND FRIGHTFULLY WILD IN APPEARANCE
THE REMEMBRANCE OF MY CHILDHOOD THE RECOLLECTION OF MY MOTHER WHOM I HAD ONLY KNOWN IN MY TENDER EARLY YEARS CAME BACK TO ME AND I KNELT IN PRAYER IMPLORING FOR THE DIVINE HELP OF WHICH I WAS SO LITTLE WORTHY
YET I WAS NOT AN ILL-NATURED FELLOW
WHY BOZERIAN CLOSS OR PURGOLD MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROUD OF SUCH A BINDING WHILE RAPIDLY MAKING THESE COMMENTS MY UNCLE KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING THE OLD TOME
MY UNCLE I CRIED WE ARE LOST NOW UTTERLY LOST WHAT ARE YOU IN A FRIGHT ABOUT NOW WAS THE CALM REJOINDER
THUS AT ONE BOUND THE RECORD OF THE EXISTENCE OF MAN RECEDED FAR BACK INTO THE HISTORY OF THE AGES PAST
SOMETIMES SENDING IT TO A GREAT HEIGHT THEN AGAIN TO A LOWER WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO THE VARIABLE PRESSURE OF THE STEAM ACCUMULATED IN ITS RESERVOIR
MY UNCLE DID NOT FORGET A SUPPLY OF TOBACCO COARSE GRAINED POWDER AND AMADOU NOR A LEATHERN BELT IN WHICH HE CARRIED A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF GOLD SILVER AND PAPER MONEY
CHAPTER V
LET US SEE WHERE WE ARE NOW
HIGHER UP THE PROTOPITHECA--THE FIRST MONKEY THAT APPEARED ON THE GLOBE--IS CLIMBING UP THE STEEP ASCENTS
SUCH LITTLE MATTERS OF DETAIL NEVER TROUBLED HIM MUCH
BESIDES I AM STARVING AND PARCHING WITH THIRST DECIDEDLY THE PROFESSOR WAS NOT GIVEN TO CONTEMPLATION
FOOTNOTE AND WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE NEGRO COUNTENANCE AND IN THE LOWEST SAVAGES
NOW ADMITTING THIS PROPORTION TO BE CONSTANT AND THE RADIUS OF THE EARTH BEING FIFTEEN HUNDRED LEAGUES THERE MUST BE A TEMPERATURE OF 360,032 DEGREES AT THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH
FAHR NINE DEGREES ONLY SINCE OUR DEPARTURE WELL WHAT IS YOUR CONCLUSION THIS IS MY CONCLUSION
WE WALKED UPON GRANITE MINGLED WITH SILICEOUS TUFA
AND GREAT AS IT IS THAT ASYLUM IS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO CONTAIN ALL PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK'S MADNESS
THEN MY UNCLE BECAME A GREAT MAN AND I WAS NOW THE NEPHEW OF A GREAT MAN--WHICH IS NOT A PRIVILEGE TO BE DESPISED
HENCE THIS TERM OF JOKUL IS APPLIED TO ALL THE ERUPTIVE MOUNTAINS IN ICELAND VERY GOOD SAID I
THIS WILL TAKE US A LONG WAY HE CRIED AND WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
HANS SAT DOWN AT ONCE
A SOFT CARPET OF MOSS AND HEPATICAS LUXURIOUSLY CLOTHED THE SOIL
I FLED FOR REFUGE INTO MY OWN LITTLE ROOM
THE SKILFUL HUNTSMAN HAD SUCCEEDED IN LIGHTING THE LANTERN
I WENT UP AGAIN TO MY ROOM AND ROLLING MY PORTMANTEAUS DOWNSTAIRS I DARTED AFTER HIM
I OBEYED
YET BY AN INEXPLICABLE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION I FORGOT MY PRESENT DANGERS TO CONTEMPLATE THE THREATENING FUTURE
I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
WHAT CONNECTION COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE BETWEEN SUCH WORDS AS ICE SIR ANGER CRUEL SACRED WOOD CHANGEABLE MOTHER BOW AND SEA
AT THIS DISTANCE FROM ITS SPRING THE WATER WAS SCARCELY TEPID AND WE DRANK OF IT WITH PLEASURE
READY HE CRIED
BUT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS HIDDEN IN A PERFECT BOWER OF RICH VERDURE AMONGST WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE OLIVE THE FIG AND VINES COVERED WITH THEIR LUSCIOUS PURPLE BUNCHES
I GRASPED HIS TREMBLING HANDS IN MINE
FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY
NO NO I REPEATED I SHALL NOT SPEAK
I BELIEVE HE DOES HANS COMES DOWN THEN STRETCHES HIS ARM TO THE SOUTH SAYING
I HAD DISCOVERED THE KEY TO THE CIPHER
I WAS UNDER A NEW COURSE OF TREATMENT WITH THE AID OF ASTONISHMENT AND MY CONVALESCENCE WAS PROMOTED BY THIS NOVEL SYSTEM OF THERAPEUTICS
BUT INSTEAD OF WALKING PEACEABLY DOWN IT AS HE HAD DONE WE WERE CARRYING A WHOLE SEA ALONG WITH US
FINSEN MAYOR OF REJKIAVIK
DRINK HE SAID AGAIN
YES WE ARE GOING UP--UP I STRETCHED OUT MY ARM
I COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
IN FACT HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN ICELAND WITH WHOM I COULD CONVERSE AT ALL
AND IF HE WAKES UP PRESENTLY WHERE SHALL WE BE
IF THAT DOCUMENT WERE DIVULGED A WHOLE ARMY OF GEOLOGISTS WOULD BE READY TO RUSH INTO THE FOOTSTEPS OF ARNE SAKNUSSEMM I DON'T FEEL SO VERY SURE OF THAT UNCLE I REPLIED
AND LET NO ONE GET BEFORE US IN THIS DESIGN OF DISCOVERING THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH CHAPTER VII
THERE THEY DISAPPEARED IN THE HOLD
THE MARBLE THE SCHIST THE LIMESTONE AND THE SANDSTONE WERE GIVING WAY TO A DARK AND LUSTRELESS LINING
MONSIEUR FRIDRIKSSEN I WISHED TO KNOW IF AMONGST YOUR ANCIENT BOOKS YOU POSSESSED ANY OF THE WORKS OF ARNE SAKNUSSEMM ARNE SAKNUSSEMM REPLIED THE REJKIAVIK PROFESSOR
STROMBOLI STROMBOLI I REPEATED
I CLOSED MY LIPS FIRMLY AND LAID MY EAR AGAINST THE WALL AGAIN
AN ICELANDIC PILOT CAME ON BOARD AND IN THREE HOURS THE VALKYRIA DROPPED HER ANCHOR BEFORE REJKIAVIK IN FAXA BAY
THESE STRAIGHT SHAFTS OF FAIR PROPORTIONS SUPPORTED AN ARCHITRAVE OF HORIZONTAL SLABS THE OVERHANGING PORTION OF WHICH FORMED A SEMI-ARCH OVER THE SEA
BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM
BY THE NEXT DAY WE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL OUR SUFFERINGS
MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
IN THE UPPERMOST REGIONS OF THE AIR IMMENSE BIRDS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CASSOWARY AND LARGER THAN THE OSTRICH SPREAD THEIR VAST BREADTH OF WINGS AND STRIKE WITH THEIR HEADS THE GRANITE VAULT THAT BOUNDS THE SKY
THREE HOURS PASS AWAY
IT IS MY SUPPOSITION THAT THIS IS THE TRANSLATOR'S WAY OF WRITING MM AND I HAVE REPLACED IT ACCORDINGLY SINCE OUR TYPOGRAPHY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH A CHARACTER WHEN THIS WORK WAS ENDED MY UNCLE TORE THE PAPER FROM ME AND EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY FOR A LONG TIME
MY UNCLE STRODE ON
LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM DURING WHICH OUR RATE CANNOT HAVE BEEN LESS THAN EIGHTY LEAGUES IN THE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS THAT IS RIGHT
BLACK NIGHT REIGNED AGAIN
THE WORD CAVERN DOES NOT CONVEY ANY IDEA OF THIS IMMENSE SPACE
A PUBLIC AUDIENCE WAS GIVEN TO THE PROFESSOR AT THE JOHANNAEUM AT WHICH HE TOLD ALL ABOUT OUR EXPEDITION WITH ONLY ONE OMISSION THE UNEXPLAINED AND INEXPLICABLE BEHAVIOUR OF OUR COMPASS
WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE
HE SPEAKS DANISH PERFECTLY WHEN CAN I SEE HIM TO-MORROW IF YOU LIKE WHY NOT TO-DAY BECAUSE HE WON'T BE HERE TILL TO-MORROW TO-MORROW THEN ADDED MY UNCLE WITH A SIGH
HANS IS ALREADY BUSY AT IT WHAT HAS HE ALREADY FELLED THE TREES OH THE TREES WERE ALREADY DOWN
SURELY IT IS THE SEA BREAKING UPON THE ROCKS
IN MY NERVOUS FRAME OF MIND I EXPECTED TO SEE THE GHOST OF HAMLET WANDERING ON THE LEGENDARY CASTLE TERRACE
BUT SUPPOSE IT TO BE STOPPED
I FEEL PECULIAR SENSATIONS LIKE MANY CREATURES ON EARTH AT THE APPROACH OF VIOLENT ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES
WELL LET US APPLY THE PROCESS I HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE DOCUMENT IN QUESTION MY UNCLE FALLING BACK INTO HIS ABSORBING CONTEMPLATIONS HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN MY IMPRUDENT WORDS
NOW I SAID WE MUST NOT LOSE THIS WATER WHAT IS THE USE OF TROUBLING OURSELVES MY UNCLE REPLIED
AT SIX O'CLOCK OUR PREPARATIONS WERE OVER
LOOK AT THAT DUST UNDER YOUR FEET
WHEN MY EYES HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRIGHT LIGHT TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SO LONG STRANGERS I BEGAN TO USE THEM TO SET MY IMAGINATION RIGHT
THIS RETURN OF TRUST IN GOD'S PROVIDENCE ALLAYED THE TURBULENCE OF MY FEARS AND I WAS ENABLED TO CONCENTRATE UPON MY SITUATION ALL THE FORCE OF MY INTELLIGENCE
NOTHING MORE BUT DON'T YOU CONCLUDE JUST WHAT YOU CONCLUDE YOURSELF
NO NOT AT ALL IMPATIENT THEN ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW YET WE ARE GOING VERY FAST WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY
WE REACHED BUEDIR A VILLAGE ON THE SEA SHORE
BESIDES TO ASSOCIATE EVEN SUCH SIMPLE IDEAS WITH WORDS AND REASON WITH THEM WAS A WORK OF TIME
THE ROCKS THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS A FEW ISOLATED CLUMPS OF FOREST TREES IN THE DISTANCE PRESENTED A WEIRD AND WONDERFUL ASPECT UNDER THESE TOTALLY NEW CONDITIONS OF A UNIVERSAL DIFFUSION OF LIGHT
MY UNCLE NOTICES IT AND LOOKS ON APPROVINGLY
MIGHT I NOT MYSELF BE MISTAKEN
FOUR SETS OF PACKAGES IN ALL
WE ALL THREE FELL DOWN FLAT
AFTER WALKING A MILE WE REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF A VAST FOREST BUT NOT ONE OF THOSE FORESTS OF FUNGI WHICH BORDERED PORT GRAEUBEN
NOW IN MINERALOGY THERE ARE MANY HALF-GREEK AND HALF-LATIN TERMS VERY HARD TO ARTICULATE AND WHICH WOULD BE MOST TRYING TO A POET'S MEASURES
HE THEREFORE WAS UNABLE TO CONVERSE WITH THE CAPTAIN ABOUT SNAEFELL THE WAY TO GET TO IT THE FACILITIES FOR TRANSPORT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PUT OFF THESE INQUIRIES UNTIL HIS ARRIVAL AND SPENT ALL HIS TIME AT FULL LENGTH IN HIS CABIN OF WHICH THE TIMBERS CREAKED AND SHOOK WITH EVERY PITCH SHE TOOK
WHERE ARE WE I ASKED FAINTLY
I WENT TO HIM
THE INSTRUMENTS WERE
LOST AT AN IMMEASURABLE DEPTH
WE WERE IMMURED WITHIN PRISON WALLS OF GRANITE
NO CERTAINLY
THIS ROOF ITSELF IS FORMED OF FRAGMENTS OF ROCK CARRIED DOWN OF ENORMOUS STONES AS IF BY SOME GIANT'S HAND
MY UNCLE MY BOY CAME TO ME AFTER A FEW SECONDS
DEEP AND HEAVY EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN THE ENORMOUS JET POSSESSED WITH MORE FURIOUS VIOLENCE SHAKES ITS PLUMY CREST AND SPRINGS WITH A BOUND TILL IT REACHES THE LOWEST STRATUM OF THE CLOUDS
SOME ONE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE US
THE STUDENTS LAID WAIT FOR HIM IN DANGEROUS PLACES AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO STUMBLE LOUD WAS THE LAUGHTER WHICH IS NOT IN GOOD TASTE NOT EVEN IN GERMANS
BUT AS SOON AS THE MEAL WAS DONE WE EACH OF US FELL DEEP INTO THOUGHT
WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER
NOW HERE WERE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO LETTERS IN THIS SENTENCE AND THESE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO LETTERS WOULD GIVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SENTENCES EACH MADE UP OF AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE FIGURES A NUMBER WHICH PASSED FAR BEYOND ALL CALCULATION OR CONCEPTION
THERE WAS THEREFORE NO ROOM FOR CONVERSATION
BY DINT OF TURNING THIS DOCUMENT ROUND AND ROUND HE TOO MIGHT DISCOVER THE KEY
YET AFTER THE FIRST MOMENT OF TERROR I FELT ASHAMED OF SUSPECTING A MAN OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FAITHFULNESS
MY UNCLE WAS TOLERABLY WELL OFF FOR A GERMAN PROFESSOR
YES IT IS LATIN MY UNCLE WENT ON
HE IS AN EIDER-DOWN HUNTER AND VERY CLEVER
YET I RESOLVED TO BE A HERO AND NOT TO BE CONQUERED BY THE PANGS OF HUNGER
PERHAPS THERE IS SOME MANUSCRIPT OF SAKNUSSEMM'S THERE AND I SHOULD BE GLAD TO CONSULT IT WELL WHILE YOU ARE THERE I WILL GO INTO THE TOWN
BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND
AM I THEN FATED--I A DENIZEN OF EARTH--TO BE PLACED FACE TO FACE WITH THESE REPRESENTATIVES OF LONG EXTINCT FAMILIES
RATE THREE AND A HALF LEAGUES AN HOUR
I TOLD HER AMUSING TALES AT WHICH SHE LAUGHED HEARTILV
THE PLACE TO RESIST THE PROFESSOR WOULD HAVE BEEN HAMBURG NOT THE FOOT OF SNAEFELL
HE WILL NO DOUBT SUCCEED
MY HAIR BRISTLES JUST AS WHEN YOU STAND UPON AN INSULATED STOOL UNDER THE ACTION OF AN ELECTRICAL MACHINE
ON FRIDAY AFTER A NIGHT DURING WHICH I FELT PANGS OF THIRST OUR LITTLE TROOP AGAIN PLUNGED INTO THE WINDING PASSAGES OF THE GALLERY
THEN AGAIN THE PAROXYSM WAS OVER
BUT I ASK WHAT NEED IS THERE TO HURRY TIME TIME FLYING WITH IRREPARABLE RAPIDITY BUT IT IS ONLY THE 16TH MAY AND UNTIL THE END OF JUNE WHAT YOU MONUMENT OF IGNORANCE
THERE WAS NO GETTING ANY FARTHER
I POSSESSED NEITHER THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN EAGLE NOR HIS FEARLESS NATURE
I LOOKED NEARER AND FOUND WE WERE IN A COAL FORMATION
BUT IT NOW SEEMS TO ME AS IF THE OTHER ANIMALS WERE TAKING PART IN THE FRAY--THE PORPOISE THE WHALE THE LIZARD THE TORTOISE
SO IT WAS JUST AN ELECTRIC JOKE FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE PROFESSOR WAS THE MOST GLORIOUS OF SAVANTS AND I WAS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
HE WAS AWAITING ONE OF TWO EVENTS EITHER THE APPEARANCE OF A VERTICAL WELL OPENING BEFORE HIS FEET DOWN WHICH OUR DESCENT MIGHT BE RESUMED OR THAT OF SOME OBSTACLE WHICH SHOULD EFFECTUALLY TURN US BACK ON OUR OWN FOOTSTEPS
MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY
ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET
IT IS SO
IT IS SO
HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY
DNW TO CREEP INTO
WE HAVE ONLY WATER ENOUGH FOR FIVE DAYS DON'T BE UNEASY AXEL WE SHALL FIND MORE THAN WE WANT WHEN WHEN WE HAVE LEFT THIS BED OF LAVA BEHIND US
IN TWENTY MINUTES WE WERE IN HOLSTEIN
I DID MY BEST
MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL M
DOVE NOI SIAMO YES WHERE ARE WE I IMPATIENTLY REPEATED
HE EXAMINES THE HORIZON ALL ROUND WITH HIS GLASS AND FOLDS HIS ARMS WITH THE AIR OF AN INJURED MAN
FINALLY ALL THE ARTICLES NEEDFUL TO SUPPLY RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS
I THOUGHT THAT MY WEAKENED VOICE COULD NEVER PENETRATE TO MY COMPANIONS
BUT WHAT PHENOMENON COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS REVERSAL OF THE POLES THE REASON IS EVIDENT UNCLE TELL ME THEN AXEL DURING THE ELECTRIC STORM ON THE LIEDENBROCK SEA THAT BALL OF FIRE WHICH MAGNETISED ALL THE IRON ON BOARD REVERSED THE POLES OF OUR MAGNET AHA
DE BLOSSEVILLE IN THE LILLOISE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD OF
FOR WE HAVE NO PROOF OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS DOCUMENT WHAT
IMPOSSIBLE SAID THE PROFESSOR SEVERELY
MY UNCLE AND I TREATED THIS LITTLE TRIBE WITH KINDNESS
IT AROSE FROM THE CONCAVE FORM OF THE GALLERY AND THE CONDUCTING POWER OF THE ROCK
AND TO WHAT A HEIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC GLORY WE SHOULD THEN ATTAIN
THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT HAZE
IN A COMPLETE LIST OF PHILOSOPHICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TRANSLATOR CANNOT FIND THE NAME
OBSERVE THAT ALL THE VOLCANOES ARE CALLED JOKULS A WORD WHICH MEANS GLACIER IN ICELANDIC AND UNDER THE HIGH LATITUDE OF ICELAND NEARLY ALL THE ACTIVE VOLCANOES DISCHARGE THROUGH BEDS OF ICE
I WAS STIFLED AND STUNNED
43 DEG
HAMS AS WAS HIS CUSTOM WOULD GO ON FOOT
WHEN COLUMBUS ASKED OF HIS SHIPS CREWS FOR THREE DAYS MORE TO DISCOVER A NEW WORLD THOSE CREWS DISHEARTENED AND SICK AS THEY WERE RECOGNISED THE JUSTICE OF THE CLAIM AND HE DISCOVERED AMERICA
I RATHER DRAGGED MYSELF THAN WALKED
THEN I AMUSED MYSELF WATCHING THE PROCESS OF THE CONVERSION OF THE TOBACCO INTO CARBON WHICH WAS BY SLOW DEGREES MAKING MY NAIAD INTO A NEGRESS
A FEW OVERHANGING ROCKS AFFORDED US SOME SHELTER FROM THE STORM
LIEDENBROCK IS NOT AT TABLE WHO COULD HAVE BELIEVED IT I SAID WITH MY MOUTH FULL
THE LAVA IN THE LAST ERUPTION OF 1229 HAD FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL
LEAVE ME TO MYSELF LEAVE YOU HERE LEAVE ME I TELL YOU
HERE IS THE EXACT FACSIMILE
BESIDES I COULD NOT TELL UPON WHAT GEOLOGICAL THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AN EXCAVATION
FORTY-EIGHT HOURS AFTER COMING OUT OF A STORM WHICH FORCED THE SCHOONER TO SCUD UNDER BARE POLES WE SIGHTED EAST OF US THE BEACON ON CAPE SKAGEN WHERE DANGEROUS ROCKS EXTEND FAR AWAY SEAWARD
THIS SHORT PASSAGE HAD NOT SERVED TO COOL MY ARDOUR
IF THIS WELL HAS AN APERTURE
I ROSE AND LEANING UPON MY IRON-POINTED STICK I ASCENDED THE GALLERY
THEN JOINING MY UNCLE I SAID
THOSE MONSTERS HELD THE MASTERY IN THE SEAS OF THE SECONDARY PERIOD
THEREFORE THE LATTER CANNOT BE A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FORMER
I TRIED TO CARRY BACK MY IDEAS TO THINGS ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
I MAKE NO RASH ASSERTIONS
IF ALL THE POWDER MAGAZINES IN THE WORLD WERE TO EXPLODE AT ONCE WE SHOULD HEAR NO MORE THAN WE DO NOW
5 THERE WAS A FRENCH RESTAURANT KEPT BY A COOK OF THE NAME OF VINCENT WHERE WE HAD AN AMPLE BREAKFAST FOR FOUR MARKS EACH 2_S
PRODUCED BY NORMAN M
SHE KISSED HER GUARDIAN
IT THEREFORE HAPPENED THAT THIS VENIAL FAULT OF MY UNCLE'S CAME TO BE PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD IN TIME AND AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE WAS TAKEN OF IT
BUT THE MYSTERY WAS EXPLAINED WHEN M
I DROVE AWAY EVERY IDEA AND CONQUERED BY MY GRIEF I ROLLED MYSELF TO THE FOOT OF THE OPPOSITE WALL
HISSINGS OF PRODIGIOUS FORCE ARE HEARD
I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU THE ASTONISHMENT OF MARTHA OR THE JOY OF GRAEUBEN
WE WALKED IN SINGLE FILE HEADED BY THE HUNTER WHO ASCENDED BY NARROW TRACKS WHERE TWO COULD NOT HAVE GONE ABREAST
WAS THERE A SHIP AT OUR DISPOSAL IN SOME UNDERGROUND HARBOUR
WAS I RESIGNED
IT WAS NINE IN THE MORNING
THAT IS IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING THERE AND WHY NOT
BECQUEREL EBELMAN BREWSTER DUMAS MILNE-EDWARDS SAINT-CLAIRE-DEVILLE FREQUENTLY CONSULTED HIM UPON THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN CHEMISTRY A SCIENCE WHICH WAS INDEBTED TO HIM FOR CONSIDERABLE DISCOVERIES FOR IN 1853 THERE HAD APPEARED AT LEIPZIG AN IMPOSING FOLIO BY OTTO LIEDENBROCK ENTITLED A TREATISE UPON TRANSCENDENTAL CHEMISTRY WITH PLATES
HANS PASSED HIS LAMP OVER EVERY PORTION OF THE BARRIER IN VAIN
GRAEUBEN WE WILL SEE WHETHER YOU WILL SAY THE SAME THING TO-MORROW TO-MORROW DEAR AXEL I WILL SAY WHAT I SAY TO-DAY GRAEUBEN AND I HAND IN HAND BUT IN SILENCE PURSUED OUR WAY
THAT WHICH I READ HAD ACTUALLY REALLY BEEN DONE
THEY WERE THE INITIALS OF THE BOLD AND DARING TRAVELLER
I DRESSED HASTILY AND CAME DOWN INTO THE STREET
THE THOUGHT CAME INTO MY MIND TO DECLARE THE WHOLE TRUTH TO MY UNCLE TO SHOW HIM THE DREADFUL STRAITS TO WHICH WE WERE REDUCED AND TO CALCULATE HOW LONG WE MIGHT YET EXPECT TO LIVE
AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS ARNE SAKNUSSEMM REPLIED MY UNCLE
WHEN WE ARRIVED UNDER THEIR SHADE MY SURPRISE TURNED INTO ADMIRATION
IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS I HAD EVER HAD AND I DID NOT EVEN DREAM
HERE IS THE ENTIRE FLORA OF THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE WORLD--THE TRANSITION PERIOD
THIS IS THE PROPORTION FOUND IN SOUTHERN LANGUAGES WHILST NORTHERN TONGUES ARE MUCH RICHER IN CONSONANTS
WAS THIS DONE ON PURPOSE
THALATTA THE SEA
THALATTA THE SEA
CERTAINLY
THIS NOISE COMES ALONG THE GALLERY
AS MAIDENS THEY WORE OVER THEIR BRAIDED HAIR A LITTLE KNITTED BROWN CAP
I ASKED
DID HE REFUSE TO ADMIT OUT OF SELF-LOVE AS AN UNCLE AND A PHILOSOPHER THAT HE HAD MISTAKEN HIS WAY WHEN HE CHOSE THE EASTERN TUNNEL
AN IMMENSE BED OF LAVA BOUNDS IT ON ONE SIDE AND FALLS GENTLY TOWARDS THE SEA
THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THOSE CLOUDS SUSPENDED OVER OUR HEADS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
I PREPARED TO FULFIL MY TASK WITH SOME ANXIETY
AND I SEE WHY SAKNUSSEMM PUT INTO THE INDEX EXPURGATORIUS AND COMPELLED TO HIDE THE DISCOVERIES MADE BY HIS GENIUS WAS OBLIGED TO BURY IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE CRYPTOGRAM THE SECRET WHAT SECRET ASKED M
ICELAND
IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY
I BORE THE TROUBLES OF THE SEA PRETTY WELL
WE WENT WITH IT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED
I STILL HELD TO THE CENTRAL HEAT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT FEEL ITS EFFECTS
THE FIRST MAN WE SAW WAS A GOOD-LOOKING FELLOW ENOUGH IN A GENERAL'S UNIFORM
THE RAREFIED AIR SCARCELY GAVE PLAY TO THE ACTION OF MY LUNGS
THERE WAS NO ROOM TO DOUBT OF THAT
WE WERE INTRODUCED INTO OUR APARTMENT A LARGE ROOM WITH A FLOOR OF EARTH STAMPED HARD DOWN AND LIGHTED BY A WINDOW THE PANES OF WHICH WERE FORMED OF SHEEP'S BLADDER NOT ADMITTING TOO MUCH LIGHT
YOU MUST NOT EXPOSE YOURSELF BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM PERFECTLY WELL A LITTLE PATIENCE MY NEPHEW
IT MIGHT BE SO
THREE O'CLOCK I REPLIED
I WISHED TO OBLIGE HIM TO RISE
AT LAST THESE WORDS OF MY UNCLE'S CAME TO ME LIKE A VAGUE MURMURING
I THOUGHT MY LAST HOUR WAS APPROACHING
IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL RIGHT MY UNCLE REPEATED
FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS SNAEFELL HAS BEEN DUMB
WHEN I OPENED MY EYES HE UTTERED A CRY OF JOY
NOTHING COULD BE MORE CERTAIN
THE MAN TO WHOM WE OWED ALL OUR SUCCESS AND OUR LIVES TOO WOULD NOT SUFFER US TO REWARD HIM AS WE COULD HAVE WISHED
HERE AND THERE WAS A LONELY FARM CALLED A BOER BUILT EITHER OF WOOD OR OF SODS OR OF PIECES OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE A POOR BEGGAR BY THE WAYSIDE
NO AXEL WE SHOULD AT LEAST FIND OUR OWN TRACES AND I SEE NOTHING BUT I DO SEE I CRIED DARTING UPON AN OBJECT LYING ON THE SAND
ACCORDING TO A RATHER OBSCURE LAW
THERE IS EVEN POSITIVE PLEASURE IN LIVING IN THIS DENSE ATMOSPHERE
HE TRIED HARD TO PUT ON AN INNOCENT LITTLE EXPRESSION OF SIMPLICITY
IT WAS A CONSTANT CONDITION THE PERMANENCY OF WHICH MIGHT BE RELIED UPON
AND OUR LAST ELECTRIC APPARATUS HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION
AND NOTHING COULD SURPASS THE ABSURDITY OF FANCYING THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REACH THE EARTH'S CENTRE
THIS PROSPECT IS MAGNIFICENT AND BUT I DON'T CARE FOR PROSPECTS
WITH ONE SPRING I BOUNDED OUT OF THE DINING-ROOM INTO THE STUDY
THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
NEVER SHOUTED MY IMPETUOUS UNCLE
BUT AT ANY RATE WE SHALL ONCE MORE BE MEN AND NOT EXHAUSTED EMPTY BAGS WELL LET US CONSUME IT THEN I CRIED
BUT IT WAS NOT SOLAR LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO HEAT
I SHALL BE DIZZY I SAID
I LOOKED ON
WELCOME WAS THE SIGHT OF THE BOER WHICH WAS HOSPITABLY OPENED TO RECEIVE US
BUT I WANTED TO KNOW WHICH OF THEM WAS TO SERVE US FOR AN EXIT FROM THE INNER WORLD
IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY
NOW WE SHALL GO BY LAND AND REALLY BEGIN TO GO DOWN
WE HAVE LOOKED FOR YOU UP THE GALLERY AND DOWN THE GALLERY
CHAPTER XXXIX
ABOUT TWELVE IMMENSE SHOALS OF SEAWEEDS CAME IN SIGHT
IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR
IMMEDIATELY THE HUNTER OR RATHER THE TRADER COMES AND ROBS THE NEST AND THE FEMALE RECOMMENCES HER WORK
I SHALL NEVER KNOW WHITHER MY MAD CAREER TOOK ME

THIS MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION ENDED IN A FEW MINUTES WITH WARM ACKNOWLEDGMENTS PAID BY THE GERMAN TO THE ICELANDIC PROFESSOR
POSSIBLY IT MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO GRADUAL ELEVATION
SOME OF THESE WOODS BECOME TRUE ANTHRACITES
BUT DON'T ALARM YOURSELF--THIS LULL CANNOT LAST LONG
IF THERE IS A RIVER OR FIORD TO CROSS AND WE SHALL MEET WITH MANY YOU WILL SEE HIM PLUNGE IN AT ONCE JUST AS IF HE WERE AMPHIBIOUS AND GAIN THE OPPOSITE BANK
YOU SEE THIS VOLCANIC ISLAND SAID THE PROFESSOR
THE CHARACTER SET IS ISO-8891-1 MAINLY THE WINDOWS CHARACTER SET
I COULD PERCEIVE IT BY THE SHARPNESS OF THE CURRENTS THAT BLEW PAST MY FACE
HAD I HEARD HIM
WHAT DOES THAT WORD MEAN I ASKED UNEASILY
ON THIS SLIGHTLY INCLINING SHORE ABOUT A HUNDRED FATHOMS FROM THE LIMIT OF THE WAVES CAME DOWN THE FOOT OF A HUGE WALL OF VAST CLIFFS WHICH ROSE MAJESTICALLY TO AN ENORMOUS HEIGHT
HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THE EXTRAORDINARY SENSATION PRODUCED BY THE RETURN OF PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US
I COULD SCARCELY SUCCEED
I AWOKE AT FIVE WITH SHATTERED NERVES TREMBLING AND WEARY
THE ONLY DISCOMFORT PROCEEDED FROM THE STRONG ODOUR OF DRIED FISH HUNG MEAT AND SOUR MILK OF WHICH MY NOSE MADE BITTER COMPLAINTS
AND YET IT REALLY MATTERED VERY LITTLE WHETHER IT WAS THE PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS THAT COVERED OUR HEADS OR THE ATLANTIC WAVES AS LONG AS WE WERE ARCHED OVER BY SOLID GRANITE
THEN WHEN OUR LEISURE HOURS CAME WE USED TO GO OUT TOGETHER AND TURN INTO THE SHADY AVENUES BY THE ALSTER AND WENT HAPPILY SIDE BY SIDE UP TO THE OLD WINDMILL WHICH FORMS SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE LANDSCAPE AT THE HEAD OF THE LAKE
CLIMATES ARE NO MORE

WE MUST KNOW HOW FAR WE ARE APART THAT IS EASY YOU HAVE YOUR CHRONOMETER YES WELL TAKE IT
SUNDAY AUGUST 16
THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE CHURCH
AS WE WENT I CHATTERED AND ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AS TO OUR WHEREABOUTS FOR I WAS TOO MUCH EXCITED NOT TO TALK A GREAT DEAL
MY UNCLE WAS REFUSED EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF STIRRING UP HIS BEAST WITH WHIP OR VOICE
BUT HOWEVER SHORT WAS MY EXAMINATION OF THIS WELL I HAD TAKEN SOME ACCOUNT OF ITS CONFORMATION
1 THE GLYPTODON AND ARMADILLO ARE MAMMALIAN
WHERE ARE WE
PERHAPS YOU WOULD KEEP US COMPANY TO THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE TO FIND THE SOLUTION OF YOUR ETERNAL DOUBTS BUT THERE WAS NO GHOSTLY SHAPE UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
HVAR HE ASKED IN ICELANDIC
NOW AXEL CRIED THE PROFESSOR WITH ENTHUSIASM NOW WE ARE REALLY GOING INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
I DREW GRAEUBEN INTO THE PROFESSOR'S STUDY
MY FEET WHICH HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE INDURATED LAVA FLOOR SUDDENLY RESTED UPON A DUST COMPOSED OF THE DEBRIS OF PLANTS AND SHELLS
A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION
BUT TELL ME WILL NOT AIR AT LAST ACQUIRE THE DENSITY OF WATER OF COURSE UNDER A PRESSURE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND TEN ATMOSPHERES AND HOW LOWER DOWN STILL LOWER DOWN THE DENSITY WILL STILL INCREASE BUT HOW SHALL WE GO DOWN THEN WHY WE MUST FILL OUR POCKETS WITH STONES WELL INDEED MY WORTHY UNCLE YOU ARE NEVER AT A LOSS FOR AN ANSWER I DARED VENTURE NO FARTHER INTO THE REGION OF PROBABILITIES FOR I MIGHT PRESENTLY HAVE STUMBLED UPON AN IMPOSSIBILITY WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE PROFESSOR ON THE SCENE WHEN HE WAS NOT WANTED
AND MAY IT NOT BE THAT THIS OLD PARCHMENT IS INTENDED TO MISLEAD I ALMOST REGRETTED HAVING UTTERED THIS LAST WORD WHICH DROPPED FROM ME IN AN UNGUARDED MOMENT
AND YET WHAT WAS THE USE OF TROUBLING MYSELF
IT WAS A MOMENT OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT
I WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND
I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND
CERTAINLY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMT IN LOOKING AT THIS MAN THAT HE WAS A HUNTER
BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE
ITS BODY IS ENTIRELY COVERED WITH A THICK ARMOUR OF SCALES AND ITS NECK AS FLEXIBLE AS A SWAN'S RISES THIRTY FEET ABOVE THE WAVES
DID HE CROSS IT
HANS KEEPING FAST BY THE HELM LET THE RAFT RUN ON WHICH AFTER ALL NEEDED NO STEERING THE WIND BLOWING DIRECTLY AFT
WITHOUT RECKONING TOO THAT IF A VERTICAL DEPTH OF SIXTEEN LEAGUES CAN BE ATTAINED ONLY BY A DIAGONAL DESCENT OF EIGHTY-FOUR IT FOLLOWS THAT WE MUST GO EIGHT THOUSAND MILES IN A SOUTH-EASTERLY DIRECTION
THE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WONDERFULLY INTERESTED IN THE ARRIVAL OF A VESSEL FROM WHICH EVERY ONE EXPECTED SOMETHING FORMED IN GROUPS UPON THE QUAY
AND THE GUIDE THERE CLAIMING HIS DUE MY UNCLE SETTLED WITH HIM
I COULD JUST SEE MY UNCLE AT FULL LENGTH ON THE RAFT AND HANS STILL AT HIS HELM AND SPITTING FIRE UNDER THE ACTION OF THE ELECTRICITY WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM
EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE WHICH WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UNROLL ITSELF FROM ITS HOLD
NOW IT IS ALL CLEAR NOW IT IS ALL UNRAVELLED
THESE RUINOUS HUTS SEEMED TO SOLICIT CHARITY FROM PASSERS-BY
I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE
HERE WAS CRUSHING EVIDENCE
LOOK AXEL LOOK ABOVE OUR HEADS AT A HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET OR MORE WE SAW THE CRATER OF A VOLCANO THROUGH WHICH AT INTERVALS OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO THERE ISSUED WITH LOUD EXPLOSIONS LOFTY COLUMNS OF FIRE MINGLED WITH PUMICE STONES ASHES AND FLOWING LAVA
THE DARKNESS ALWAYS DEEP TWENTY YARDS BEFORE US PREVENTED US FROM ESTIMATING THE LENGTH OF THE GALLERY
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIABOLICAL GRIN
BUT WILL IT DO YOU ANY MORE GOOD TO DEVOUR IT WITH YOUR EYES THAN WITH YOUR TEETH
ON MY RIGHT WERE NUMBERLESS GLACIERS AND INNUMERABLE PEAKS SOME PLUMED WITH FEATHERY CLOUDS OF SMOKE
BUT BEFORE QUITTING THE DECK OF THE SCHOONER HE DRAGGED ME FORWARD AND POINTING WITH OUTSTRETCHED FINGER NORTH OF THE BAY AT A DISTANT MOUNTAIN TERMINATING IN A DOUBLE PEAK A PAIR OF CONES COVERED WITH PERPETUAL SNOW HE CRIED
THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL
I HAD BECOME QUITE A LIEDENBROCK IN MY REASONINGS
IT WAS A STAR WHICH SEEN FROM THIS DEPTH HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE 46
AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE
THEN THE ZOOPHYTES OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD ALSO RETURN TO NOTHING
I COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
IN AN HOUR THE CAPITAL OF DENMARK SEEMED TO SINK BELOW THE DISTANT WAVES AND THE VALKYRIA WAS SKIRTING THE COAST BY ELSINORE
MY UNCLE'S WARD WAS AT THAT TIME AT ALTONA STAYING WITH A RELATION AND IN HER ABSENCE I WAS VERY DOWNHEARTED
ALL HOPE WAS NOW AT AN END
WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THEM ALL
THE CLOUDS HAVE REACHED THE UTMOST LIMIT OF THE LOFTY VAULT AND THERE LIE STILL BATHED IN THE BRIGHT GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS BORNE BY THE ICE FIELDS FROM THE NORTH ARE CARRIED EVEN INTO ICELAND
WOULD THERE BE TIME LEFT TO DIE OF STARVATION
IN A FEW SECONDS I FOUND MYSELF IN THE AIR AGAIN WHICH I INHALED WITH ALL THE FORCE OF MY LUNGS
MY EYES FAIL UNDER THE DAZZLING LIGHT MY EARS ARE STUNNED WITH THE INCESSANT CRASH OF THUNDER
AS LONG AS THE HEART BEATS AS LONG AS BODY AND SOUL KEEP TOGETHER I CANNOT ADMIT THAT ANY CREATURE ENDOWED WITH A WILL HAS NEED TO DESPAIR OF LIFE RESOLUTE WORDS THESE
THE UPWARD MOVEMENT CEASED
SCARCELY CAN I JOT DOWN A FEW HURRIED NOTES
MY OPINION WAS THAT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS WOULD HAPPEN THAN AN AWFUL SCENE WHEN MY UNCLE SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED THAT HIS DINNER WAS DEVOURED
THIS IS A WANT MUCH TO BE DEPLORED IN A SPEAKER
MIGHT NOT SOME UNHOPED-FOR RESULT COME OF IT
I HAVE A CONFUSED IMPRESSION LEFT OF CONTINUOUS EXPLOSIONS LOUD DETONATIONS A GENERAL SHAKING OF THE ROCKS ALL AROUND US AND OF A SPINNING MOVEMENT WITH WHICH OUR RAFT WAS ONCE WHIRLED HELPLESSLY ROUND
BUT CONTRARY TO ALL OUR EXPECTATIONS MY UNCLE THE ICELANDER AND MYSELF WERE SITTING HALF-WAY DOWN A MOUNTAIN BAKED UNDER THE BURNING RAYS OF A SOUTHERN SUN WHICH WAS BLISTERING US WITH THE HEAT AND BLINDING US WITH THE FIERCE LIGHT OF HIS NEARLY VERTICAL RAYS
NOW SINCE HE WAS NOT WRITING IN HIS OWN MOTHER TONGUE HE WOULD NATURALLY SELECT THAT WHICH WAS CURRENTLY ADOPTED BY THE CHOICE SPIRITS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
SOMETIMES HE MIGHT IRRETRIEVABLY INJURE A SPECIMEN BY HIS TOO GREAT ARDOUR IN HANDLING IT
I WAS THUS STEEPED IN THE MARVELLOUS ECSTASY WHICH ALL HIGH SUMMITS DEVELOP IN THE MIND
THEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE HUNTER HAD GONE NO FARTHER
MY FIRST LESSON IN DIZZINESS LASTED AN HOUR
HOW COULD SPRINGS BREAK THROUGH SUCH WALLS AS THESE BUT PERHAPS THIS PASSAGE RUNS TO A VERY GREAT DEPTH
IT IS BLIND AND NOT ONLY BLIND BUT ACTUALLY HAS NO EYES AT ALL I LOOKED
THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THOSE OF THE MANUSCRIPT OF SNORRE TURLLESON
BUT A LEARNED MAN IS ALWAYS A PHILOSOPHER WHEN HE SUCCEEDS IN REMAINING COOL AND ASSUREDLY PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK POSSESSED THIS QUALITY TO A SURPRISING DEGREE
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS
AT SIX IN THE EVENING HANS ASKS FOR HIS WAGES AND HIS THREE RIX DOLLARS ARE COUNTED OUT TO HIM
FANCY A TALL SPARE MAN OF AN IRON CONSTITUTION AND WITH A FAIR COMPLEXION WHICH TOOK OFF A GOOD TEN YEARS FROM THE FIFTY HE MUST OWN TO
OFTEN WE WERE MET BY STREAMS WHICH WE HAD TO FORD WITH GREAT CARE NOT TO WET OUR PACKAGES
AND WHY PRAY BECAUSE THIS CRATER IS EVIDENTLY FILLED WITH LAVA AND BURNING ROCKS AND THEREFORE BUT SUPPOSE IT IS AN EXTINCT VOLCANO EXTINCT YES
I SAW THOSE HUGE ELEPHANTS WHOSE LONG FLEXIBLE TRUNKS WERE GROUTING AND TURNING UP THE SOIL UNDER THE TREES LIKE A LEGION OF SERPENTS
IN HIGH WESTERLY WINDS IT WAS MANIFEST THAT THE RED TILES OF THE ROOF WOULD BE SCATTERED IN THE AIR TO THE GREAT DANGER OF THE FAITHFUL WORSHIPPERS
SINCE NATURE HAD HERE PROVIDED VEGETABLE NOURISHMENT WHY SHOULD NOT THE TERRIBLE MAMMALS BE THERE TOO
THIS DUTY DONE I WAS TO JOIN MY COMPANIONS ON THE RAFT WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN UNLOADED
AGES SEEM NO MORE THAN DAYS
THE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS IN FACT WE HAD TO RATION OURSELVES
MY UNCLE TOOK SOUNDINGS SEVERAL TIMES
FOR ALL OUR INGENUITY WAS REQUIRED TO PACK EVERY ARTICLE TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
WHAT ONE MAN HAS DONE ANOTHER MAY DO I HOPE SO
NOW DO YOU SEE ANYTHING UPON THAT KNEE BONE YES
BUT I WAS THE VICTIM NOT THE MASTER OF MY OWN THOUGHTS
IS THIS WHY YOU ARE HERE SIR BUT WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UPON ME GRAEUBEN COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE THE UNEASINESS AND DISTRESS OF MY MIND
IN THIS EASTERN GALLERY MADE UP OF LAVAS SCHISTS AND COAL WE HAVE NOT MET WITH A SINGLE PARTICLE OF MOISTURE
MY UNCLE WAS FAST ASLEEP
HAPPILY CERTAIN ASPERITIES AND A FEW BLISTERINGS HERE AND THERE FORMED STEPS AND WE DESCENDED LETTING OUR BAGGAGE SLIP BEFORE US FROM THE END OF A LONG ROPE
THE COMPASS WHICH I CONSULTED FREQUENTLY GAVE OUR DIRECTION AS SOUTH-EAST WITH INFLEXIBLE STEADINESS
WHILE THESE QUESTIONS WERE BEING DEBATED WITH GREAT ANIMATION MY UNCLE MET WITH A REAL SORROW
LOOK AT THOSE SHIVERING ROCKS
WHEN THE EYE PASSED BEYOND THESE GREEN SURROUNDINGS IT RESTED ON A WIDE BLUE EXPANSE OF SEA OR LAKE WHICH APPEARED TO ENCLOSE THIS ENCHANTING ISLAND WITHIN A COMPASS OF ONLY A FEW LEAGUES
IT WAS WATER
I MUST CONCLUDE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR SENSES HAD BEEN DECEIVED THAT OUR EYES DID NOT SEE WHAT WE SUPPOSED THEY SAW
THE NIGHT WAS DARK
AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
BUT NOW WE WERE MOUNTING UP WITH EXCESSIVE SPEED
IF THAT HUGE REVOLVING PILLAR SLOPED DOWN IT WOULD INVOLVE US IN ITS WHIRLING EDDIES
THE FIRST AND THE LAST MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER
YOU DON'T DOUBT MY WORD SAID MY UNCLE
SO YOU SEE THAT BY GOING GRADUALLY DOWN AND GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DENSITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE WE DON'T SUFFER AT ALL NOTHING EXCEPT A LITTLE PAIN IN THE EARS THAT'S NOTHING AND YOU MAY GET RID OF EVEN THAT BY QUICK BREATHING WHENEVER YOU FEEL THE PAIN EXACTLY SO I SAID DETERMINED NOT TO SAY A WORD THAT MIGHT CROSS MY UNCLE'S PREJUDICES
HOLM AN ISLAND CRIES MY UNCLE
THE ICELANDIC HUTS ARE MADE OF EARTH AND TURF AND THE WALLS SLOPE INWARD
DE QUATREFAGES HOW I WISH YOU WERE STANDING HERE AT THE SIDE OF OTTO LIEDENBROCK CHAPTER XXXVIII
WE WERE LONG ENGAGED IN DISCUSSING AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE LIQUID STRUCTURE OF THE TERRESTRIAL NUCLEUS
WHEN SHE HAS STRIPPED HERSELF BARE THE MALE TAKES HIS TURN TO PLUCK HIMSELF
THE ISLET RESEMBLES WITH A MOST DECEIVING LIKENESS AN ENORMOUS CETACEAN WHOSE HEAD DOMINATES THE WAVES AT A HEIGHT OF TWENTY YARDS
THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
THE SOIL SHIVERS AND SHAKES UNDER OUR FEET LIKE THE SIDES OF AN OVERHEATED BOILER FILLED WITH STEAM STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE
AH I CRIED HERE IS AN INHABITANT OF THIS HAPPY LAND IT WAS BUT A POOR BOY MISERABLY ILL-CLAD A SUFFERER FROM POVERTY AND OUR ASPECT SEEMED TO ALARM HIM A GREAT DEAL
HOW THE THEORIES WILL HINDER US WON'T THEY I SAW THAT HE WAS ONLY LAUGHING AT ME
BUT VERY LIKELY THE DINNER IS NOT HALF COOKED FOR IT IS NOT TWO YET
OH
OH
I REMARK UPON THIS TO MY UNCLE WHO REPLIES DOUBTFULLY
IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG-BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE MORE AT HOME THAN HE WAS HIMSELF
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN SUCH A THING SAID MARTHA
I SAT OVERWHELMED AS IF WITH A SUDDEN DEADLY BLOW
AND IT WAS SO
A JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH BY JULES VERNE REDACTOR'S NOTE
THE CURRENTS OF WIND SEEMED TO HAVE HAD NO EFFECT UPON THEIR SHAPE AND IN THE MIDST OF THE WINDY BLASTS THEY STOOD UNMOVED AND FIRM JUST LIKE A CLUMP OF PETRIFIED CEDARS
I WEPT FOR YOU MY POOR BOY
I HAVE HAD A BAD NIGHT I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF HORRORS BUT I HAD FOLLOWED THE BANKS OF THE ELBE AND PASSED THE TOWN
THIS HIGH AUTHORITY MAINTAINED THAT THE SOIL OF MOULIN QUIGNON WAS NOT DILUVIAL AT ALL BUT WAS OF MUCH MORE RECENT FORMATION
BUT IT IS THE VERY LAST--YOU HEAR!--THE LAST
THE HEAT INCREASES
ANOTHER HOUR PASSED AND EXCEPT SOME SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE TEMPERATURE NOTHING NEW HAD HAPPENED
I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
MY UNCLE WHO HAD AN INSTINCT OF HIS OWN TOO APPLIED PRESSURE AND WAS AGAIN REFUSED BY THE ANIMAL SIGNIFICANTLY SHAKING HIS HEAD
HE WALKED HE SLID HE SCRAMBLED HE TUMBLED WITH A PERSISTENCY WHICH ONE COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE
BUT THIS INFERNAL FLUID BURNED MY THROAT AND I COULD NOT EVEN ENDURE THE SIGHT OF IT
CHAPTER X
THERE WAS NO FEAR OF HEAT NONE OF DISASTROUS RAIN
WHAT TWO
FORWARD
FORWARD
I APPEALED TO HANS
IN TWO HOURS FROM REJKIAVIK WE ARRIVED AT THE BURGH OF GUFUNES CALLED AOLKIRKJA OR PRINCIPAL CHURCH
WHAT'S THAT YOU ARE SAYING HE ASKED
CHAPTER XXXII
YET IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME
YES TRULY SOME ONE IS SPEAKING
IN ICELAND DURING THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY THE SUN DOES NOT SET
FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR
AND WHATEVER THEIR HUMANE FEELINGS MAY PROMPT THEM TO BESTOW WILL BE GLADLY ADDED TO THE MANSION-HOUSE ICELAND RELIEF FUND
HAVING ENTERED BY ONE VOLCANO WE HAD ISSUED OUT OF ANOTHER MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM SNAEFELL AND FROM THAT BARREN FAR-AWAY ICELAND
BY THE 7TH OF AUGUST OUR SUCCESSIVE DESCENTS HAD BROUGHT US TO A DEPTH OF THIRTY LEAGUES
CHAPTER XXVII
BUT MY GEOLOGICAL INSTINCT WAS STRONGER THAN MY PRUDENCE AND UNCLE LIEDENBROCK HEARD MY EXCLAMATION
HIS STEED LOWERED HIS HEAD TO EXAMINE THE NEAREST WAVES AND STOPPED
NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
A JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH BY JULES VERNE
THE WORLD THEN BELONGED TO REPTILES
BUT EVEN IN THIS CASE I HAVE ONLY TO MAKE THE GREATER HASTE
FROM THAT HOUR WE HAD NO FURTHER OCCASION FOR THE EXERCISE OF REASON OR JUDGMENT OR SKILL OR CONTRIVANCE
IN DEALING WITH SUCH A STRANGE INDIVIDUAL THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT PROMPT OBEDIENCE
AFTER THIS LITTLE PINCH OF WARMTH THE DIFFERENT GROUPS RETIRED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ROOMS
HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED AND CONVULSED BY A VIOLENT UPHEAVAL OF THE LOWER STRATA
LET US START
THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN PROCEEDING LAY IN NOT SLIDING TOO FAST DOWN AN INCLINE OF ABOUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES
IN SPITE OF DARKNESS NOISE ASTONISHMENT AND TERROR I THEN UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
TO ALL THESE TITLES TO HONOUR LET ME ADD THAT MY UNCLE WAS THE CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM OF MINERALOGY FORMED BY M
AND IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THEY FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR SHELVES ONLY AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A YEAR OR TWO AND IN THE MEANTIME SAID MY UNCLE RATHER SPITEFULLY STRANGERS WELL WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
WOLCOTT
I FOLLOWED WITH MY EYES HIS TREMBLING HANDS I TOOK COUNT OF EVERY MOVEMENT
I HAVE BUT TO TRACE IT BACK AND I MUST COME UPON THEM
A FEW SPARKLING STREAMS RAN ALMOST IN SILENCE UNDER WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SHADE OF THE TREES BUT THAT THERE WAS NO SHADOW
FOR MY PART OH M
I WAS AHEAD OF THE OTHERS
WHILST WE WERE BEING PROJECTED FORWARD THE HOT AIR ALMOST STOPPED MY BREATH
I AM SURROUNDED BY GRANITE WALLS AND THE LOUDEST EXPLOSION COULD NEVER BE HEARD HERE
OF THE TWO THIS IS WHAT I SHOULD PREFER
THEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER OUR LONG FAST THESE FEW MOUTHFULS OF MEAT AND BISCUIT MADE US TRIUMPH OVER OUR PAST AGONIES
AFTER THE EXHAUSTION OF THE BASALT THE VOLCANO THE POWER OF WHICH GREW BY THE EXTINCTION OF THE LESSER CRATERS SUPPLIED AN EGRESS TO LAVA ASHES AND SCORIAE OF WHICH I COULD SEE LENGTHENED SCREES STREAMING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAIN LIKE FLOWING HAIR
COME THIS WON'T DO
WE ARE STILL IN THE PRIMITIVE PERIOD
WHILST DEATH FROM STARVATION WOULD LEAVE US NOT THE SMALLEST HOPE IN THE WORLD
IT POINTED DUE NORTH
AT THE APPROACH OF AN ERUPTION THESE JETS WOULD REDOUBLE THEIR ACTIVITY BUT DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE ERUPTION
IN AN HOUR WE HAD GONE A MILE AND A QUARTER AND DESCENDED TWO THOUSAND FEET
AND THEN WE MUST YIELD TO EVIDENCE
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE-ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET
NOW SAID HE WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHAT BOOKS YOU HOPED TO FIND IN OUR LIBRARY AND I MAY PERHAPS ENABLE YOU TO CONSULT THEM MY UNCLE'S EYES AND MINE MET
BY LAND THIS WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY-TWO MILES TO BE DONE SAID MY UNCLE IN TWO DAYS
MY UNCLE STRODE FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THE NARROW PASSAGE
THE HEAT OF THE GLOBE CONTINUALLY INCREASES AND NEUTRALISES THAT OF THE SUN
HERE I MUST DIE THE MOST DREADFUL OF DEATHS
JULES VERNE DESERVE TO BE MADE WIDELY KNOWN IN ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES BY MEANS OF CAREFULLY PREPARED TRANSLATIONS
I SEIZED THE HUNTER'S HANDS AND PRESSED THEM WHILE HE LOOKED ON ME WITHOUT MOVING A MUSCLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS ENOUGH ROOM TO PASS
THE LABOURS OF MM
YET THE DEEP MARKS OF CONICAL TEETH UPON THE IRON PICK ARE CERTAINLY THOSE OF THE CROCODILE
LET US START CHAPTER XXII
WERE WE THEN TURNING BACK TO WHERE THE PHENOMENA OF CENTRAL HEAT RULED IN ALL THEIR RIGOUR AND WOULD REDUCE THE MOST REFRACTORY ROCKS TO THE STATE OF A MOLTEN LIQUID
YES INDEED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I WAS ABOUT LIKE AN AWKWARD AND UNLUCKY LOVER I HAD COMPROMISED MYSELF BY WRITING THIS UNFORTUNATE SENTENCE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN I LEFT THE RIGHT ROAD I HAD NOT NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF THE STREAM
THE WORST PERIL OF ALL IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT HITHERTO THINGS HAD NOT GONE ON SO BADLY AND THAT I HAD SMALL REASON TO COMPLAIN
OF THE GEOLOGIC PERIOD
THE KEY OF THE DOCUMENT THE PROFESSOR STARED AT ME OVER HIS SPECTACLES
THE RAFT HAD NOT STRUCK AGAINST ANY HARD RESISTANCE BUT HAD SUDDENLY BEEN CHECKED IN ITS FALL
WHENEVER HE CAUSED A FINE DEW OF RAIN TO FALL UPON ITS SURFACE IT HEAVED UP INTO LITTLE MONTICULES IT BECAME OXYDIZED AND FORMED MINIATURE MOUNTAINS
NO REPLIES MY UNCLE
SOUND DOES NOT TRAVEL WITH GREAT VELOCITY
IN ANY CASE I WILL TAX MY INTELLIGENCE TO DIRECT THEIRS
HOW I THEN BLESSED MY UNCLE'S FORESIGHT IN PREVENTING THE HUNTER FROM STOPPING UP THE HOLE IN THE GRANITE
THEY WENT NO FARTHER
STUPEFACTION
FAHR SO THERE SHOULD MY LAD AND ALL THIS SOLID GRANITE OUGHT TO BE RUNNING IN FUSION YOU SEE THAT IT IS NOT SO AND THAT AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS FACTS COME TO OVERTHROW THEORIES I AM OBLIGED TO AGREE
THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB
IT IS A RAY OF DAYLIGHT I THOUGHT SLIDING IN THROUGH THIS CLEFT IN THE ROCK
HANS ALMOST THROWN OFF HIS FEET BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK UTTERED A CRY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH I SOON UNDER STOOD THE CAUSE WHEN PLUNGING MY HANDS INTO THE SPOUTING TORRENT I WITHDREW THEM IN HASTE FOR THE WATER WAS SCALDING HOT
SUCH AS IT WAS IT DID US GOOD SERVICE
MY UNCLE HAD NOT SHUT HIS EYES ALL NIGHT
IT WAS JUST THE WEATHER FOR TOURISTS
WHEN I AWOKE NEXT MORNING THAT INDEFATIGABLE WORKER WAS STILL AT HIS POST
WE STOOD DUMB WITH FEAR
MY LAST HOPE WAS SHATTERED AGAINST THIS GRANITE WALL
FOR IN THREE HOURS WE STOPPED AT KIEL CLOSE TO THE SEA
BUT HOW WAS IT WITH SAKNUSSEMM I CRIED
GRAEUBEN WAS A LOVELY BLUE-EYED BLONDE RATHER GIVEN TO GRAVITY AND SERIOUSNESS
IN THREE HOURS I HAD SEEN NOT ONLY THE TOWN BUT ITS ENVIRONS
HANS WAS NOT MISTAKEN HE SAID
HOW WAS I TO RETURN
A VAGUE HOPE WAS RETURNING TO MY HEART
I MEAN LATIN
QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
PRONOUNCE MY NAME NOTING EXACTLY THE SECOND WHEN YOU SPEAK
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME I HAD TO OBEY
LET HIM FIND IT OUT HIMSELF IF HE CAN
IS IT NOT KNOWN THAT THE NUMBER OF VOLCANOES HAS DIMINISHED SINCE THE FIRST DAYS OF CREATION
THE RUNIC WRITING EXERCISES THE PROFESSOR UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS RUNIC SAID THE PROFESSOR BENDING HIS BROWS
COME ON BOARD QUICKLY AND LET US PUSH OFF HANS WITH A VIGOROUS THRUST SENT US FROM THE SHORE
I BENT OVER A PROJECTING ROCK AND GAZED DOWN
THAT WHICH ANOTHER HAD DONE I SUPPOSED WE MIGHT ALSO DO AND NOTHING THAT WAS NOT SUPERHUMAN APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO ME
IT IS NOW RISING TO ITS LEVEL AND CARRYING US WITH IT WHERE TO I CANNOT TELL
SNEFFELS OR SNAEFELL HAS SEVERAL CRATERS
WITHIN ITS EXTREMITY A LITTLE HARBOUR WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE PYRAMIDAL CLIFFS WHERE THE STILL WATERS SLEPT UNTOUCHED BY THE BOISTEROUS WINDS
PALE AND TREMBLING UNDER THE BLINDING SPLENDOUR AND THE MELTING HEAT IT DROPS AT MY FEET SPINNING SILENTLY ROUND UPON THE DECK
BJARNE WAS ON BOARD
TO THE EAST THERE WAS ONLY ONE IN THE 80TH DEGREE OF NORTH LATITUDE THE ESK IN JAN MAYEN ISLAND NOT FAR FROM SPITZBERGEN
AS HE IS ASSURED BY A FIRST-RATE INSTRUMENT MAKER CHADBURN OF LIVERPOOL THAT AN ANEROID CAN BE CONSTRUCTED TO MEASURE ANY DEPTH HE HAS THOUGHT IT BEST TO FURNISH THE ADVENTUROUS PROFESSOR WITH THIS MORE FAMILIAR INSTRUMENT
WHAT I SHOUTED
I ALMOST FANCIED I SHOULD PRESENTLY SEE SOME SHIP ISSUE FROM IT FULL SAIL AND TAKE TO THE OPEN SEA UNDER THE SOUTHERN BREEZE
SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART
HAD I NOT BENT UNDER THE IRON RULE OF THE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
THERE IT IS SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR
SAINT MICHAEL'S CLOCK HAS ONLY JUST STRUCK HALF-PAST ONE THEN WHY HAS THE MASTER COME HOME SO SOON PERHAPS HE WILL TELL US THAT HIMSELF HERE HE IS MONSIEUR AXEL
I WAS DISCONCERTED AND IF I MUST TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH I WAS ASHAMED
HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE
IT'S ALL OVER FOR IN SUCH A FEARFUL STATE OF DEBILITY IT WAS MADNESS TO THINK OF EVER REACHING THE UPPER WORLD AGAIN
ONE THOUGHT ABOVE ALL OTHERS HARASSED AND ALARMED ME
LOOK DOWN HE CRIED
THIS SEEMED LIKE GOING RATHER TOO FAR
THENCE HIS EYE SWEEPS A LARGE AREA OF SEA AND IT IS FIXED UPON A POINT
IT WAS MY ONLY WORD OF REPROACH FOR I KNEW HOW MUCH HE MUST BE SUFFERING IN SEEKING ME WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
AND SHARING HIS ASTONISHMENT BUT I THINK NOT HIS JOY I READ ON THE WESTERN FACE OF THE BLOCK IN RUNIC CHARACTERS HALF MOULDERED AWAY WITH LAPSE OF AGES THIS THRICE-ACCURSED NAME
I POINT THEM TO THE ICELANDER
IT ROCKED UPON THE LAVA TORRENT AMIDST A DENSE FALL OF ASHES
ARE THESE WATERS THEN BARE OF INHABITANTS
WE WERE HARDLY THINKING OF THAT
THE WATERS AGAIN COVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH
CHAPTER XXXIV
BUT THERE IS A VERY MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF EXTINCT ONES
SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO GROUND UNDER ME
EVENING CAME AND AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY I PERCEIVED NO CHANGE IN THE LUMINOUS CONDITION OF THE AIR
HIS LONG THIN NOSE WAS LIKE A KNIFE BLADE
WHAT COULD I DO
HEAR ME TO THE END THE PROFESSOR WENT ON WITH A FIRM VOICE
AN ORDINARY BAROMETER WOULD NOT HAVE ANSWERED THE PURPOSE AS THE PRESSURE WOULD INCREASE DURING OUR DESCENT TO A POINT WHICH THE MERCURIAL BAROMETER 1 WOULD NOT REGISTER
AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS MARVELLOUS SPECTACLE WE RETURNED TO THE SHORE TO REGAIN THE GROTTO AND I FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE STRANGEST THOUGHTS
THESE REFLECTIONS CAME INTO MY MIND WHILST I WAS CONTEMPLATING THE MINERAL WEALTH STORED UP IN THIS PORTION OF THE GLOBE
THE SKY IS CALM AND MOTIONLESS
ON THE 2ND AT SIX IN THE EVENING ALL OUR PRECIOUS BAGGAGE BEING SAFELY ON BOARD THE VALKYRIA THE CAPTAIN TOOK US INTO A VERY NARROW CABIN
HAS MY UNCLE GIVEN UP THE EXPEDITION OR IS IT HAPPILY TERMINATED
AND YET WHAT A GOOD DINNER IT WAS
BUT HE SPOKE NOT A WORD AND WENT ON
WELL WELL I THOUGHT
BUT THIS ONE DISPLAYS A PECULIARITY CONFINED TO ALL FISHES THAT INHABIT SUBTERRANEAN WATERS
TEN DAYS THE CAPTAIN REPLIED IF WE DON'T MEET A NOR'-WESTER IN PASSING THE FAROES BUT ARE YOU NOT SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE DELAYS NO M
NO DOUBT HE SAW SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE
WE ARE PROSTRATED AND WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE
IT LIES STILL
BESIDES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERMINABLE HESITATION BEFORE THIS CHOICE OF ROADS
BUT WHEN THE PICK WAS SHIPPED AGAIN HANS POINTED OUT ON ITS SURFACE DEEP PRINTS AS IF IT HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY COMPRESSED BETWEEN TWO HARD BODIES
WE WILL TRY TO SCALE THAT SNAEFELL
BUT WHAT COULD A BALL DO AGAINST THE SCALY ARMOUR WITH WHICH THESE ENORMOUS BEASTS WERE CLAD
SECONDS WHICH SEEMED AGES PASSED AWAY AND AT LAST THESE WORDS REACHED ME
I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING
HIS VOICE WHICH HAD FOR A MOMENT BEEN TENDER AND GENTLE HAD NOW BECOME HARD AND THREATENING
I SEARCHED EVERY NOOK AND CORNER EVERY CRACK AND CRANNY IN THE RAFT
HIS LONG HAIR BLOWN BY THE PELTING STORM AND LAID FLAT ACROSS HIS IMMOVABLE COUNTENANCE MAKES HIM A STRANGE FIGURE
AM I QUITE MISTAKEN OR HAVE WE RETURNED TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
COULD THERE POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A MORE EXACT GUIDE
A SPARK WOULD NOW DEVELOP THE WHOLE OF OUR PREPARATIONS INTO ACTIVITY
IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC--AND WHY NOT
ARE WE AGAIN ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE NO CERTAINLY NOT THEN I MUST BE MAD
ALL THE WHILE I WAS OVERWHELMING HIM WITH QUESTIONS WHICH HE ANSWERED READILY
BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
SO MUCH HONOUR COULD NOT BUT EXCITE ENVY
I MADE IT A POINT OF HONOUR
A BARREN LAND WE HAD STARTED UNDER A SKY OVERCAST BUT CALM
SCARTARIS MY UNCLE SHOT A TRIUMPHANT GLANCE AT ME
SUCH IS THEIR PONDEROUS WEIGHT THAT THEY CANNOT RISE FROM THE HORIZON
YOU MEAN THAT LEARNED SIXTEENTH CENTURY SAVANT A NATURALIST A CHEMIST AND A TRAVELLER JUST SO ONE OF THE GLORIES OF ICELANDIC LITERATURE AND SCIENCE THAT'S THE MAN AN ILLUSTRIOUS MAN ANYWHERE QUITE SO AND WHOSE COURAGE WAS EQUAL TO HIS GENIUS I SEE THAT YOU KNOW HIM WELL MY UNCLE WAS BATHED IN DELIGHT AT HEARING HIS HERO THUS DESCRIBED
COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO
AND UNLESS HE CAME HERE LIKE MYSELF AS A TOURIST ON A VISIT AND AS A PIONEER OF SCIENCE I CAN ENTERTAIN NO DOUBT OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF HIS REMOTE ORIGIN 1 THE FACIAL ANGLE IS FORMED BY TWO LINES ONE TOUCHING THE BROW AND THE FRONT TEETH THE OTHER FROM THE ORIFICE OF THE EAR TO THE LOWER LINE OF THE NOSTRILS
I HAVE BANDAGED YOUR HEAD WITH COMPRESSES WHICH MUST NOT BE DISTURBED
THERE IS A SORT OF PASSAGE WHICH INCLINES TO THE RIGHT
AND WHAT IS THE TITLE OF THIS MARVELLOUS WORK I ASKED WITH AN AFFECTED EAGERNESS WHICH HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BLIND NOT TO SEE THROUGH
AND THOUGH STILL WARM IT BROUGHT LIFE BACK TO THE DYING
IN THIS LANTERN THERE IS A SPIRAL GLASS TUBE FROM WHICH THE AIR HAS BEEN EXCLUDED AND IN WHICH REMAINS ONLY A RESIDUUM OF CARBONIC ACID GAS OR OF NITROGEN
I CANNOT HELP MAKING THE REMARK
BUT ON HIS RAPID WAY HE HAD FOUND TIME TO FLING HIS HAZEL STICK INTO A CORNER HIS ROUGH BROADBRIM UPON THE TABLE AND THESE FEW EMPHATIC WORDS AT HIS NEPHEW
AND IS IT NOT KNOWN AT THE PRESENT TIME THAT THE GREATEST COLD OF THE ETHEREAL REGIONS IS NEVER LOWER THAN 40 DEGREES BELOW ZERO FAHR
2
BUT I WENT ON ALL THE SAME
IT HAS AN INKY FLAVOUR WHICH IS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
THROUGH THE BEDS OF SCHIST COLOURED WITH DELICATE SHADES OF GREEN RAN IN WINDING COURSE THREADS OF COPPER AND MANGANESE WITH TRACES OF PLATINUM AND GOLD
BUT SOON THE REPTILE'S AGONY DRAWS TO AN END
I HAD QUITE DECIDED I WOULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR
YET I ASKED MYSELF IF I WAS NOT DEPENDING TOO MUCH ON THIS CHANGE IN THE ROCK
THIS UNFORESEEN SPECTACLE WAS MOST CHARMING TO EYES LONG USED TO UNDERGROUND DARKNESS
ELIE DE BEAUMONT STOOD ALMOST ALONE IN HIS OPINION
ONLY THINK THAT UNDER THIS JARGON THERE MAY LIE CONCEALED THE CLUE TO SOME GREAT DISCOVERY AS FOR ME I WAS OF OPINION THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL IN IT
CERTAINLY NO WRITER BEFORE M
YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING DELIGHTED MY BOY DELIGHTED
THOMSEN PLACED HIS SERVICES AT OUR DISPOSAL AND WE VISITED THE QUAYS WITH THE OBJECT OF FINDING OUT THE NEXT VESSEL TO SAIL
JA MISTOUR SAID ONE OF THE ICELANDERS IN A TONE OF ALARM
HE IS COURAGEOUS SOBER AND SUREFOOTED
BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC
FORTUNATELY THERE IS NOT MUCH OF AN ASCENT
I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISED IN THIS GALLERY THE PRESENCE OF A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE DANGEROUS GAS CALLED BY MINERS FIREDAMP THE EXPLOSION OF WHICH HAS OFTEN OCCASIONED SUCH DREADFUL CATASTROPHES
FOR SOME MINUTES I AM STILL CONTEMPLATING THE GEYSER
MONDAY AUGUST 17 I AM TRYING TO RECALL THE PECULIAR INSTINCTS OF THE MONSTERS OF THE PRE-ADAMITE WORLD WHO COMING NEXT IN SUCCESSION AFTER THE MOLLUSCS THE CRUSTACEANS AND LE FISHES PRECEDED THE ANIMALS OF MAMMALIAN RACE UPON THE EARTH
THAT'S THE MOST DIRECT WAY NO DOUBT
WHEN THE LATTER SUSPENDING HIS LABOURS FOR A MOMENT UTTERED A SOUND NO DOUBT UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN HORSES AND FARRIERS AND IMMEDIATELY A TALL AND UGLY HAG APPEARED FROM THE HUT
A WATERSPOUT AN IMMENSE LIQUID COLUMN WAS BEATING UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WATERS
IYLOAU LOLWRB OU,NGE VWMDRN EEYEA
I AM SURE I DID TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT THEM
IS HIS NAME NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE MANUSCRIPT MY UNCLE RAISED HIS SPECTACLES TOOK UP A STRONG LENS AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE BLANK PAGES OF THE BOOK
I LEANED OVER THE TABLE
THOMSEN FOR HIS KINDNESS AND WE RETURNED TO THE PHOENIX HOTEL
HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT
MAN IS SO CONSTITUTED THAT HEALTH IS A PURELY NEGATIVE STATE
BUT IS IT NOT A DREAM
I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE I THEN REMEMBERED THAT THE PROFESSOR BEFORE STARTING HAD ESTIMATED THE LENGTH OF THIS UNDERGROUND SEA AT THIRTY LEAGUES
THE ICELANDERS OFTEN WEAR ARMS OF THIS KIND
THEN I UNDERSTOOD THE REASON OF THAT FEARFUL SILENCE WHEN FOR THE LAST TIME I LISTENED TO HEAR IF ANY SOUND FROM MY COMPANIONS COULD REACH MY EARS
WHEN I GOT PERMISSION TO COME DOWN AND FEEL THE SOLID STREET PAVEMENTS I WAS AFFLICTED WITH SEVERE LUMBAGO
THENCE INNUMERABLE FISSURES AND DEPRESSIONS
THEN A FEW STEPS BROUGHT ME TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE A BUT COMPARED WITH THE TOWN HALL OF HAMBURG A PALACE IN COMPARISON WITH THE CABINS OF THE ICELANDIC POPULATION
WHEN SCIENCE HAS UTTERED HER VOICE LET BABBLERS HOLD THEIR PEACE I RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE VERY CRESTFALLEN
I CAN SEE ITS GREAT FINS
BUT DOES IT FOLLOW THAT HE HAS REALLY ACCOMPLISHED SUCH A JOURNEY
NO MATTER
ON THE 6TH AND 7TH OF JULY WE KEPT FOLLOWING THE SPIRAL CURVES OF THIS SINGULAR WELL PENETRATING IN ACTUAL DISTANCE NO MORE THAN TWO LEAGUES
THE WIND IS RATHER STRONG
WHAT IS THE MATTER MY UNCLE ASKED
SHADOWS OF GREAT CLOUDS SWEPT HEAVILY OVER ITS SILVER-GREY SURFACE
HIGHER YET THE PTERODACTYLE WING-FINGERED DARTS IN IRREGULAR ZIGZAGS TO AND FRO IN THE HEAVY AIR
YET I REFUSED TO BELIEVE WE SHOULD START
WE MUST FLY WE MUST DRAG HIM
RIGHT AND LEFT WE SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR A WAY UP AND DOWN SIDE TO SIDE
IT ASSUMES REGULAR FORMS THE ARRANGEMENT OF WHICH IS OFTEN VERY SURPRISING
BUT AFTER ALL IT IS SURPRISING WHAT DOES THE THERMOMETER SAY TWENTY-SEVEN SIX TENTHS 82 DEG
BUT WHAT DID WE WANT ARMS FOR
JUNE 20
SUCH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS VOLCANOES AT THE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH UPON MY WORD THIS IS A VERY CLEVER HYPOTHESIS I EXCLAIMED IN SPITE RATHER OF MYSELF
SNORTING FLAMES DARTED THEIR FIERY TONGUES AT US
IT WAS FORMED BY ONE OF THOSE TORRENTS OF STONES FLUNG UP BY THE ERUPTIONS CALLED STING BY THE ICELANDERS
MY UNCLE LIGHTLY FOLLOWED WHILE OUR HUNTER REMAINED AT HIS POST LIKE A MAN TOO WISE EVER TO BE ASTONISHED
THERE STOOD BEFORE ME PRODUCTIONS OF EARTH BUT OF GIGANTIC STATURE WHICH MY UNCLE IMMEDIATELY NAMED
SO THEN AXEL REPLIED THE PROFESSOR IRONICALLY YOU HAVE FOUND NO COURAGE OR ENERGY IN THESE FEW DROPS OF WATER COURAGE I SEE YOU JUST AS FEEBLE-MINDED AS YOU WERE BEFORE AND STILL EXPRESSING ONLY DESPAIR WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS THIS I HAD TO DO WITH AND WHAT SCHEMES WAS HE NOW REVOLVING IN HIS FEARLESS MIND
AFTER A CONSIDERABLE LAPSE OF TIME OUR SPEED REDOUBLED
WHAT'S THIS HE CRIED
THE NORTHERN SHORE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO DIP UNDER THE HORIZON
THE POOR MAN WAS SO ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH HIS ONE IDEA THAT HE HAD EVEN FORGOTTEN HOW TO GET ANGRY
LOOK LOOK DOWN THERE
NO NEVER
NO NEVER
THIS FISH BELONGS TO AN EXTINCT FAMILY OF WHICH ONLY FOSSIL TRACES ARE FOUND IN THE DEVONIAN FORMATIONS WHAT I CRIED
BUT THE BRUTE ANSWERED THESE ARGUMENTS WITH KICKS AND ENDEAVOURS TO THROW HIS RIDER
EVEN INCREASED DENSITY AIR HAS NO EFFECT UPON ITS RATE OF TRAVELLING
AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME WE EACH HAD THREE OR FOUR OF THESE BRATS ON OUR SHOULDERS AS MANY ON OUR LAPS AND THE REST BETWEEN OUR KNEES
YOU AGREE WITH ME NOW CRIED THE PROFESSOR LAUGHING
DOES IT FOLLOW THAT BECAUSE THE MONSTER HAS SLEPT SINCE 1229 HE MUST THEREFORE NEVER AWAKE AGAIN
I WAS THEREFORE MEDITATING A PROPER INTRODUCTION TO THE MATTER SO AS NOT TO SEEM TOO ABRUPT WHEN THE PROFESSOR JUMPED UP CLAPPED ON HIS HAT AND PREPARED TO GO OUT
MAY GOD GIVE US STRENGTH TO CLIMB UP THE CRATER AGAIN RETURN SAID MY UNCLE AS IF HE WAS RATHER ANSWERING HIMSELF THAN ME
TO-MORROW MORNING AT SIX PRECISELY MY UNCLE DECREED WE START AT TEN O'CLOCK I FELL UPON MY BED A DEAD LUMP OF INERT MATTER
SUDDENLY HANS RISES AND POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AT THE MENACING OBJECT HE SAYS
RIGHT AND LEFT I COULD SEE DEEP CHANNELS LIKE HUGE TUNNELS OUT OF WHICH ESCAPED DENSE VOLUMES OF SMOKE
AND THANKS TO HIM WE CROSSED MANY A DANGEROUS SPOT WHICH WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE CLEARED ALONE
THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID
AFTER PASSING THE PORT TOO I HAD REACHED THE ALTONA ROAD
A MINERALOGIST AT BESANCON HAD JUST SENT US A COLLECTION OF SILICEOUS NODULES WHICH I HAD TO CLASSIFY
THE PROFESSOR HARDLY TOOK HIS EYES OFF IT
FOUR HORSES WERE TO BE PLACED AT OUR DISPOSAL--TWO TO CARRY HIM AND ME TWO FOR THE BAGGAGE
ASSUREDLY IT WAS MY UNCLE WHEN HE RETURNED THE NIGHT BEFORE FROM HIS HURRIED WALK
50 DEG
IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED MONDAY AUGUST 24._--WILL THERE BE AN END TO IT
STROMBOLI
AT FIRST I WAS WONDERING THAT I WAS NO LONGER THIRSTY AND I WAS FOR ASKING FOR THE REASON
THE WALLS ASSUMED A CRYSTALLISED THOUGH SOMBRE APPEARANCE
BESIDES OUR HORSES INSTINCTIVELY CHOSE THE EASIEST PLACES WITHOUT EVER SLACKENING THEIR PACE
REASON HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR ACTIONS
I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND FOLLOWING THE GUIDE'S EXAMPLE I WENT OFF INTO AN UNHAPPY SLUMBER FANCYING I COULD HEAR OMINOUS NOISES OR FEEL TREMBLINGS WITHIN THE RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAIN
SOON IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT IF WE CONTINUED OUR WALK WE SHOULD WIDEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE STREAM THE NOISE OF WHICH WAS BECOMING FAINTER
THE NATURE OF THE ROCK ASSURES ME OF THIS AND INSTINCT AGREES WITH LOGIC TO SUPPORT MY CONVICTION
THE MERYCOTHERIUM RUMINATING BEAST FOUND IN THE DRIFT OF ICECLAD SIBERIA
THE STONES ADHERING BY NO SOIL OR FIBROUS ROOTS OF VEGETATION ROLLED AWAY FROM UNDER OUR FEET AND RUSHED DOWN THE PRECIPICE BELOW WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN AVALANCHE
THE CIPHER IS OF LATER DATE THAN THE BOOK AN UNDOUBTED PROOF OF WHICH I SEE IN A MOMENT
PERHAPS WE SHALL BE MORE FORTUNATE IF WE FOLLOW THE WESTERN TUNNEL I SHOOK MY HEAD INCREDULOUSLY
IT APPEARS TO ME A CERTAINTY THAT THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE WAS WRITTEN IN A PROPER MANNER AND AFTERWARDS DISTORTED BY A LAW WHICH WE HAVE YET TO DISCOVER
NOT A SPADE NOT A PICKAXE NOT A HAMMER WAS LEFT US
THE PROVISIONS THE BAGGAGE THE INSTRUMENTS THE GUNS AND A GOOD QUANTITY OF FRESH WATER FROM THE ROCKS AROUND ALL FOUND THEIR PROPER PLACES ON BOARD
I KNOW THAT CUVIER AND BLUMENBACH HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST-TERTIARY PERIOD
I HAVE THEREFORE NO EXACT RECOLLECTION OF WHAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE FOLLOWING HOURS
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE HAD LEFT THE LAVA PATH AND THAT THIS ROAD COULD NOT POSSIBLY LEAD TO THE EXTINCT FURNACE OF SNAEFELL
I WAS SUFFERING TOO KEENLY AND WHAT EMBITTERED MY THOUGHTS WAS THAT THERE WAS NO REMEDY
A SMOKE FOG SEEMED TO DROWN THEM
IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD
HERE AND THERE I COULD SEE PUFFS AND JETS OF STEAM CURLING UP INTO THE AIR CALLED IN ICELANDIC REYKIR ISSUING FROM THERMAL SPRINGS AND INDICATING BY THEIR MOTION THE VOLCANIC ENERGY UNDERNEATH
ITS ALMOST PERPENDICULAR WALLS WERE BRISTLING WITH INNUMERABLE PROJECTIONS WHICH WOULD FACILITATE THE DESCENT
I THEN LEARNT THAT MY PROVIDENTIAL FALL HAD BROUGHT ME EXACTLY TO THE EXTREMITY OF AN ALMOST PERPENDICULAR SHAFT
I HAD AT THAT MOMENT QUITE COURAGE ENOUGH TO STRAP MY KNAPSACK TO MY SHOULDERS AND START
BLESSINGS ON THAT STORM
THE ST THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
AND THAT EVENING I FOUND OUT THAT TEMPERANCE WAS NOT AMONG THE VIRTUES THAT DISTINGUISHED MY HOST
DERE NERE DOWN THERE REPEATED MY UNCLE
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE CRIED
FOUR MILES ONLY HE EXCLAIMED
AT LAST AFTER A MOST DELIGHTFUL TIME OF REVIVING ENERGY I CRIED WHY THIS IS A CHALYBEATE SPRING NOTHING COULD BE BETTER FOR THE DIGESTION SAID MY UNCLE
FOR DESSERT HE GAVE US A FEW CUPS OF COFFEE AND NEVER WAS COFFEE SO DELICIOUS
AT LAST I FAILED UTTERLY
BUT WITHOUT STOPPING TO LOOK UP NEW ARGUMENTS I SIMPLY TOOK UP OUR SITUATION SUCH AS IT WAS
YOU AXEL WILL TAKE ANOTHER THIRD OF THE PROVISIONS AND THE ARMS
WE COME IN SIGHT OF A SMALL CENTRAL BASIN OUT OF WHICH THE GEYSER SPRINGS
THE NIGHT WAS FEARFUL
WHAT A CAPITAL SOURCE OF STRENGTH HANS HAS FOUND FOR US HERE
TO BE SURE THE FOURTEENTH FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH LETTERS MADE THE ENGLISH WORD ICE
BUT I ASSURE YOU THERE IS PLENTY LEFT DO YOU THINK SO SAID MY UNCLE PRETENDING TO LOOK VERY MODEST AND TRYING TO HIDE THE CURIOSITY WAS FLASHING OUT OF HIS EYES
THE AIR WAS CLEAR--AND THE NORTH-WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY
I COULD HEAR THE CRASHING NOISE OF THEIR LONG IVORY TUSKS BORING INTO THE OLD DECAYING TRUNKS
WE WERE STRONGLY ATTACHED TO OUR BRAVE EIDER-DOWN HUNTER
I LIGHTED MY LONG CROOKED PIPE WITH A PAINTING ON IT OF AN IDLE-LOOKING NAIAD
NO CERTAINLY NOT WAS THE PROFESSOR'S FIRM REPLY
IT WILL BE LONGER BUT MORE INTERESTING VERY WELL THEN
I NO LONGER HAD THE STRENGTH TO STOP MYSELF
THE CAPTAIN DISPOSED OF US SUMMARILY
NO SENSIBLE YOUNG MAN SHOULD FOR A MOMENT ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROPOSAL
SURELY YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN I CRIED
AND THY FELLOW-CREATURES MAY EVEN NOW AFTER THE LAPSE OF THREE CENTURIES AGAIN TRACE THY FOOTSTEPS THROUGH THESE DEEP AND DARKSOME WAYS
I SAW THERE WAS A SMALL TOWN OF THAT NAME ON THE BANKS OF THE HVALFIORD FOUR MILES FROM REJKIAVIK
MY UNCLE'S NUMEROUS PACKAGES HIS VOLUMINOUS IMPEDIMENTA WERE UNLOADED REMOVED LABELLED WEIGHED PUT INTO THE LUGGAGE VANS AND AT SEVEN WE WERE SEATED FACE TO FACE IN OUR COMPARTMENT
HIS INTENDING PASSENGER WAS SO JOYFUL THAT HE ALMOST SQUEEZED HIS HANDS TILL THEY ACHED
SO HE WAS GOING IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS DIFFICULTY TO GIVE WAY TO ALL THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS CHARACTER AND I WAS PREPARING FOR A VIOLENT OUTBREAK WHEN TWO O'CLOCK STRUCK BY THE LITTLE TIMEPIECE OVER THE FIREPLACE
AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
IF WE HAD HAD PROVISIONS ENOUGH FOR MONTHS HOW COULD WE GET OUT OF THE ABYSS INTO WHICH WE WERE BEING HURLED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE TORRENT
BUT ON THE 8TH ABOUT NOON THE FAULT TOOK TOWARDS THE SOUTH-EAST A MUCH GENTLER SLOPE ONE OF ABOUT FORTY-FIVE DEGREES
IS THAT ALL DO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I CAN'T EXPLAIN THE INEXPLICABLE BUT YOU WILL SOON SEE AND UNDERSTAND THAT GEOLOGY HAS NOT YET LEARNT ALL IT HAS TO LEARN THEN LET US GO I ANSWERED QUICKLY
THEN SEIZING HIS GLASS HE GAZES ATTENTIVELY FOR A MINUTE WHICH SEEMS TO ME AN AGE
WE WILL EXPLORE THE CRATER
WE WERE NOW BEGINNING TO SCALE THE STEEP SIDES OF SNAEFELL
MY UNCLE STILL HAD HIS EYE UPON HIS WORK
MY COMPANIONS WERE SUFFERING TOO AND NOT ONE OF US DARED TOUCH THIS WRETCHED REMNANT OF OUR GOODLY STORE
FAHR AN INCREASE OF ONLY 4 DEG
IT WAS THEREFORE NOT DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY OUR WHEREABOUTS
YET I THINK I RECOGNISE THE PROMONTORY AT THE FOOT OF WHICH HANS CONSTRUCTED OUR LAUNCH
OF OUR INSTRUMENTS NONE WERE SAVED BUT THE COMPASS AND THE CHRONOMETER
THAT WHICH I HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO CONFESS AT LAST HAD TO BE TOLD
IT IS ALL FOR THE BEST SINCE WE HAVE LEFT THAT WEARY HORIZONTAL SEA WHICH LED US NOWHERE
THE LOOSE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK TREMBLED BENEATH US AND THE UTMOST CARE WAS NEEDED TO AVOID DANGEROUS FALLS
I PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THE NECESSITY OF ABIDING A PARTICULAR MOMENT OF THE TIDE TO UNDERTAKE THE CROSSING OF THE FIORD WHEN THE SEA HAVING REACHED ITS GREATEST HEIGHT IT SHOULD BE SLACK WATER
THEN THE HORSES ROUSED BY THE DRIVER'S WHISTLING DARTED OFF AT A GALLOP ON THE ROAD TO ALTONA
THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
AND LOOK AT ITS BACK AFTER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
WHEN THE TEN MINUTES WERE OVER WE STARTED OFF AGAIN WITH RENEWED AND INCREASED SPEED
THE ANIMAL BELONGED TO THE SAME ORDER AS THE STURGEON BUT DIFFERED FROM THAT FISH IN MANY ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS
THERE ROCKS OF THE TRAPPEAN AND VOLCANIC CLASS INCLUDING TRACHYTE BASALT AND TUFFS AND AGGLOMERATES ASSOCIATED WITH STREAMS OF LAVA HAVE MADE THIS A LAND OF SUPERNATURAL HORRORS
HAD HE DURING THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT CAUGHT A SOUND A MURMURING OF SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE WHICH HAD FAILED TO AFFECT MY HEARING
YET IN THE MIDST OF MY STUPEFACTION I SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF A NOISE
THE EARTH HAS BEEN HEATED BY COMBUSTION ON ITS SURFACE THAT IS ALL
THAT CONVERSATION THREW ME INTO A FEVER
THAT'S A LUNATIC ASYLUM SAID ONE OF OR TRAVELLING COMPANIONS
A RAILWAY RUG EACH INTO WHICH WE ROLLED OURSELVES WAS OUR SOLE COVERING
BUT THE SUBTERRANEAN VEGETATION WAS NOT CONFINED TO THESE FUNGI
SURELY HE WAS NOT GOING OUT TO SHUT US IN AGAIN
WE WERE ROUNDING THE IMMENSE BASE OF THE VOLCANO
THE CREW CONSISTED OF FIVE MEN ALL DANES
WE HAD ALREADY ATTAINED A DEPTH OF SIX THOUSAND FEET BEYOND THAT HITHERTO REACHED BY THE FOOT OF MAN SUCH AS THE MINES OF KITZ BAHL IN TYROL AND THOSE OF WUTTEMBOURG IN BOHEMIA
BUT NOW THE RAIN FORMS A RUSHING CATARACT IN FRONT OF THAT HORIZON TOWARD WHICH WE ARE RUNNING WITH SUCH MADDENING SPEED
HAS THE ERUPTION STOPPED I CRIED
WATER REPEATED MY UNCLE
DRIVEN FORWARD WITH A SWIFTNESS THAT CANNOT BE MEASURED
I AM LOTH TO BELIEVE THESE ATMOSPHERIC MENACES AND YET I CANNOT HELP MUTTERING
THE STREET NOISES CEASED
BUT THE TEMPERATURE WAS MUCH LOWER
WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME
I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING LOST IN THE MAZES OF THIS VAST SUBTERRANEAN LABYRINTH
BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE
BUT WE HAD FLASKS AND MY UNCLE DEPENDED ON SPRINGS FROM WHICH TO FILL THEM
AT A DISTANCE OF FIVE HUNDRED PACES AT THE TURN OF A HIGH PROMONTORY APPEARED A HIGH TUFTED DENSE FOREST
TWO OF RUHMKORFF'S APPARATUS WHICH BY MEANS OF AN ELECTRIC CURRENT SUPPLIED A SAFE AND HANDY PORTABLE LIGHT 2 THE ARMS CONSISTED OF TWO OF PURDY'S RIFLES AND TWO BRACE OF PISTOLS
CERTAIN PUFFS OF AIR REACHED US
NOW THERE IS NO PROOF THAT SNAEFELL IS EXTINCT
DOWN WITH YOU WHAT TOOK PLACE AT THAT MOMENT
UNLESS INDEED MISSING ME AND SUPPOSING ME TO BE BEHIND THEY TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE BACK
IT WAS A FACT THAT A FEW YEARS BEFORE THIS WHILST MY UNCLE WAS WORKING AT HIS GREAT CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS HE WAS FORTY-EIGHT HOURS WITHOUT EATING AND ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE OBLIGED TO SHARE IN THIS SCIENTIFIC FAST
WHOEVER POSSESSES THE KEY OF THIS CIPHER WILL READ IT WITH FLUENCY
OUR HOST GAVE THE PROFESSOR VERY GREAT PLEASURE BY PRESENTING HIM WITH A MAP OF ICELAND FAR MORE COMPLETE THAN THAT OF HENDERSEN
HEAVY FEET MADE THE WHOLE FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO SHAKE
MY UNCLE SWALLOWED TWO MOUTHFULS AT A TIME TO GET ON FASTER
NO INDEED
HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD AND GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR A START
PERTUBATA SEU INORDINATA AS EUCLID HAS IT VERY WELL THOUGHT I IF YOU CAN BRING ORDER OUT OF THAT CONFUSION MY DEAR UNCLE YOU ARE A CLEVER MAN LET US EXAMINE CAREFULLY SAID HE AGAIN TAKING UP THE LEAF UPON WHICH I HAD WRITTEN
BUT IT WAS NOT
AND MY IMAGINATION FAILED TO SUPPLY THEM
ARE NOT ALL BODIES SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THEIR MASS TO THE POWER OF UNIVERSAL ATTRACTION
WHERE DID IT LEAD TO
I SUCCEEDED IN CATCHING UNCERTAIN STRANGE UNDISTINGUISHABLE WORDS
YET IT WAS LANGUAGE I WAS SURE OF IT
WHAT A VERY BAD NOTION THAT WAS OF HIS I THOUGHT TO MYSELF TO TAKE SOUNDINGS JUST HERE
BUT WHILST THEY SUFFER FROM COLD IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RISE WE WERE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CONTRARY EFFECT
WHY IT WOULD BE SIMPLY DISGRACEFUL AND AS HE SPOKE MY UNCLE HALF UNDRESSED IN RAGS A PERFECT SCARECROW WITH HIS LEATHERN BELT AROUND HIM SETTLING HIS SPECTACLES UPON HIS NOSE AND LOOKING LEARNED AND IMPOSING WAS HIMSELF AGAIN THE TERRIBLE GERMAN PROFESSOR OF MINERALOGY
MY BRAIN GOT HEATED MY EYES WATERED OVER THAT SHEET OF PAPER
THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
A SMALL STURGEON THE PROFESSOR EYES THE CREATURE ATTENTIVELY AND HIS OPINION DIFFERS FROM MINE
GO BACK
IF OUR IMPATIENCE HAD ARMED OUR HANDS WITH POWER WE SHOULD HAVE SHATTERED THE ROCK INTO A THOUSAND FRAGMENTS
BEING FOSSILS WE LOOKED UPON ALL THOSE THINGS AS MERE JOKES
AND WHY SHOULD NOT THESE WATERS YIELD TO US FISHES OF UNKNOWN SPECIES AT ANY RATE HE REPLIED WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY YET WELL LET US MAKE SOME LINES AND SEE IF THE BAIT WILL DRAW HERE AS IT DOES IN SUBLUNARY REGIONS WE WILL TRY AXEL FOR WE MUST PENETRATE ALL SECRETS OF THESE NEWLY DISCOVERED REGIONS BUT WHERE ARE WE UNCLE
ARE WE BEING TAKEN UP IN AN ERUPTION
HERE LIVE THE MERCHANTS AND TRADERS IN WOODEN CABINS MADE OF RED PLANKS SET HORIZONTALLY
CONSULT THE BAROMETER IN FACT THE MERCURY WHICH HAD RISEN IN THE INSTRUMENT AS FAST AS WE DESCENDED HAD STOPPED AT TWENTY-NINE INCHES
NOW WE HAD MADE THREE TIMES THE DISTANCE YET STILL THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS NOT IN SIGHT
HAD WE A RIVER A LAKE A SEA TO DEPEND UPON
IT IS PERFECTLY WELL KNOWN THAT THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE RISES ONE DEGREE FOR EVERY 70 FEET IN DEPTH
I WANTED A GOOD NIGHT'S REST
A FEW LIGHT VAPOURS LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK DENOTED THE PLACE OF HOT SPRINGS
NEITHER LOOKED AT THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT
AN OLD DOCUMENT ENCLOSED AN IMMEMORIAL TIME WITHIN THE FOLDS OF THIS OLD BOOK HAD FOR HIM AN IMMEASURABLE VALUE
BUT HOW SHOULD I BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HOUSE
WHAT ARE THE FINEST ARCHES OF BRIDGES AND THE ARCADES OF CATHEDRALS COMPARED WITH THIS FAR REACHING VAULT WITH A RADIUS OF THREE LEAGUES BENEATH WHICH A WIDE AND TEMPEST-TOSSED OCEAN MAY FLOW AT ITS EASE OH I AM NOT AFRAID THAT IT WILL FALL DOWN UPON MY HEAD
NOW AS THE EIDER DUCK DOES NOT SELECT STEEP CLIFFS FOR HER NEST BUT RATHER THE SMOOTH TERRACED ROCKS WHICH SLOPE TO THE SEA THE ICELANDIC HUNTER MIGHT EXERCISE HIS CALLING WITHOUT ANY INCONVENIENT EXERTION
DURING THE FIRST PART OF OUR WALK NOT MEETING WITH THE PROMISED SPRING I FELT MY AGONY RETURNING
LOOK DOWN WELL
WELL CRIED MY UNCLE LET US MAKE A WAY WITH OUR PICKAXES TOO HARD FOR THE PICKAXE WELL THEN THE SPADE THAT WOULD TAKE US TOO LONG WHAT THEN WHY GUNPOWDER TO BE SURE
IN VAIN DID I TRY TO DETECT A SMILE UPON THEIR LIPS
THIS REFLECTION RESTORED ME TO CALMNESS AND I TURNED TO OTHER THOUGHTS
TOGETHER WE MIGHT HAVE OVER-RULED THE OBSTINATE PROFESSOR
THE CONVERSATION WAS CARRIED ON IN THE VERNACULAR TONGUE WHICH MY UNCLE MIXED WITH GERMAN AND M
THE BIT OF WOOD AFTER DISAPPEARING RETURNED TO THE SURFACE AND OSCILLATED TO AND FRO WITH THE WAVES
EXPLANATIONS WERE GIVEN MARTHA WAS SET AT LIBERTY RAN OFF TO THE MARKET AND DID HER PART SO WELL THAT IN AN HOUR AFTERWARDS MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED AND I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION
THE TWO MONSTERS PASS WITHIN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS OF THE RAFT AND HURL THEMSELVES THE ONE UPON THE OTHER WITH A FURY WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM SEEING US
AFTER CROSSING A FEW NARROW STREETS WHERE SOME CONVICTS IN TROUSERS HALF YELLOW AND HALF GREY WERE AT WORK UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE GANGERS WE ARRIVED AT THE VOR FRELSERS KIRK
HE WAS A LEARNED EGOTIST
TO-MORROW WE WILL DO IT AGAIN SAID THE PROFESSOR
THE WICK HAD BURNT ITSELF OUT
THEY BOIL THEY RISE IN WHIRLING EDDIES OF STEAM
BUT HE MADE LITTLE USE OF HIS ARMS IN SPEAKING LIKE A MAN WHO KNEW NOTHING OR CARED NOTHING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF GESTURES
BUT AT A LATER PERIOD A WIDE CHASM FORMED DIAGONALLY FROM SOUTH-WEST TO NORTH-EAST THROUGH WHICH WAS GRADUALLY FORCED OUT THE TRACHYTE WHICH WAS TO FORM A MOUNTAIN CHAIN
SHOULD I GO UP OR DOWN
HANS SAID HE WILL TAKE CHARGE OF THE TOOLS AND A PORTION OF THE PROVISIONS
TAENDER SAID HE
ONLY HIS LONG NECK SHOOTS UP DROPS AGAIN COILS AND UNCOILS DROOPS LASHES THE WATERS LIKE A GIGANTIC WHIP AND WRITHES LIKE A WORM THAT YOU TREAD ON
IT'S NOTHING ELSE SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR WITH A LOUD LAUGH
THE OLD SERVANT VISIBLY MOVED RETURNED TO THE KITCHEN MOANING PITEOUSLY
SOME OF THESE DIVIDING THE BEACH WITH THEIR SHARP SPURS FORMED CAPES AND PROMONTORIES WORN AWAY BY THE CEASELESS ACTION OF THE SURF
IF THIS IS THE CASE ITS ORIGIN MAY WELL BE ATTRIBUTED TO SUBTERRANEAN FIRES
AN ILLUSION HAS LAID HOLD UPON ME
BUT ITS INEXPLICABLE BEHAVIOUR EXERCISED MY MIND FEARFULLY
WE ARE IN ASIA I CRIED ON THE COASTS OF INDIA IN THE MALAY ISLANDS OR IN OCEANIA
I LEAN FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE TRUNKS OF IMMENSE CONIFERS
I TRIED TO RESUME THE CONVERSATION
BUT DOES IT SHUT EQUALLY WELL
YIELDING TO SOME VAST POWER FROM BELOW IT HAD BROKEN ASUNDER LEAVING THIS GREAT HOLLOW INTO WHICH HUMAN BEINGS WERE NOW PENETRATING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
NEVER HAD I SEEN THE MAN SO PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE AND SO DISTURBED
WHENCE THIS HEAT
HE INDULGED IN SOME OF THOSE LEARNED JOKES WHICH NEVER DO ANYBODY ANY HARM
AT THIS RATE HE SAID WE SHALL MAKE THIRTY LEAGUES IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AND WE SHALL SOON COME IN SIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE SHORE
AT LAST I REACHED THE APEX WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MY UNCLE DRAGGING ME UP BY THE COLLAR
MORE THAN THAT I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT IT
I SAW THAT HIS SILENCE WAS NOTHING BUT ILL-HUMOUR
COULD ANYTHING BE MORE DELICIOUS THAN THE SENSATION THAT OUR BURNING INTOLERABLE THIRST WAS PASSING AWAY AND LEAVING US TO ENJOY COMFORT AND PLEASURE
BUT THEN MY UNCLE ACQUAINTED ME WITH THE CAUSE OF THE STRANGE NOISE
VEGETATION BECOMES ACCELERATED
NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID
BUT THIS WAY SEEMED INDEFINITELY PROLONGED AND INSTEAD OF SLIDING ALONG THE HYPOTHENUSE AS WE WERE NOW DOING HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DROPPED DOWN THE TERRESTRIAL RADIUS
IF IT WERE NEEDED WE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE COMPELLED HIM TO REGAIN THE HEIGHTS OF SNAEFELL
YOU WILL GATHER A HARVEST OF INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS
THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY
I NO LONGER THOUGHT OF SUN MOON AND STARS TREES HOUSES AND TOWNS NOR OF ANY OF THOSE TERRESTRIAL SUPERFLUITIES WHICH ARE NECESSARIES OF MEN WHO LIVE UPON THE EARTH'S SURFACE
LET US GET DOWN
MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
I WAS THINKING OF THAT
HE HESITATED
1 IN M
IT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY CALLED THE SAURIAN WHALE FOR IT HAS BOTH THE SWIFTNESS AND THE RAPID MOVEMENTS OF THIS MONSTER OF OUR OWN DAY
AND YET WHAT CAUSE WAS THERE FOR ANGER
SHE TALKED QUIETLY
THIS VAST TURBARY MEASURED IN CERTAIN RAVINES HAD IN MANY PLACES A DEPTH OF SEVENTY FEET AND PRESENTED LAYERS OF CARBONIZED REMAINS OF VEGETATION ALTERNATING WITH THINNER LAYERS OF TUFACEOUS PUMICE
BOUCHER DE PERTHES IN THE STONE QUARRIES OF MOULIN QUIGNON NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE
BESIDES I THOUGHT HAVE NOT I A GUARANTEE THAT I SHALL NOT LOSE MY WAY A CLUE IN THE LABYRINTH THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN MY FAITHFUL STREAM
IT IS AN ENORMOUS PORPOISE YES REPLIED MY UNCLE AND THERE IS A SEA LIZARD OF VAST SIZE AND FARTHER ON A MONSTROUS CROCODILE
UNDERSTAND THIS CLEARLY ADDED THE PROFESSOR
A VAPOURY ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED THE EARTH STILL VEILING THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN
THE DIN AND UPROAR AROUND US BECAME MORE AND MORE INTENSIFIED
THE RAFT WAS SOON HURRIED AND DRIVEN FORWARD WITH A RAPID BUT IRREGULAR MOVEMENT WHICH LASTED ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN
BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION HE DECIDED ON SPEAKING
WE ARE OBLIGED TO SECURE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE EVERY ARTICLE THAT BELONGS TO OUR CARGO
CHAPTER XLIII
JUST AS THE POOR LITTLE WRETCH WAS GOING TO TAKE TO HIS HEELS HANS CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND BROUGHT HIM TO US KICKING AND STRUGGLING
A THERMOMETER EXPOSED TO THIS ATMOSPHERE WOULD HAVE MARKED 150 DEG
I AM IN OPEN MUTINY AGAINST THE PROFESSOR WHO VOUCHSAFES NO ANSWER
MARTHA MUST HAVE CONCLUDED THAT SHE WAS VERY MUCH BEHINDHAND FOR THE DINNER HAD ONLY JUST BEEN PUT INTO THE OVEN
THE ROAD WAS RESUMED
IT WAS NEVER EITHER YOURS OR MINE OR THE HUNTER'S NOR DID IT BELONG TO ANY OF THOSE HUMAN BEINGS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT INHABIT THIS INNER WORLD
QUOD FECI ARNE SAKNUSSEMM.[1 WHICH BAD LATIN MAY BE TRANSLATED THUS
IT WAS LIKE AN AURORA BOREALIS A CONTINUOUS COSMICAL PHENOMENON FILLING A CAVERN OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO CONTAIN AN OCEAN
THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW THERE WAS NO DENYING IT
WE WERE AGREED THAT IT COULD NOT BE IN A LIQUID STATE FOR A REASON WHICH SCIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONFUTE 1 THE DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE ARE GIVEN BY JULES VERNE ACCORDING TO THE CENTIGRADE SYSTEM FOR WHICH WE WILL IN EACH CASE SUBSTITUTE THE FAHRENHEIT MEASUREMENT
THROUGH THE OUTLETS NOW MADE FIRST ESCAPED THE EJECTED BASALT OF WHICH THE PLAIN WE HAD JUST LEFT PRESENTED SUCH MARVELLOUS SPECIMENS
AND BESIDES WE WERE BEGINNING TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO THIS TROGLODYTE 1 LIFE
DRINK SAID HE
THE WAY WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE ARDUOUS THE ASCENT STEEPER AND STEEPER
THE MAN WHO COULD SPEAK SO UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WAS OF NO ORDINARY TYPE
HE CAN ONLY SPARE TIME TO SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS VICIOUSLY
ARNE SAKNUSSEMM EVERYWHERE CHAPTER XL
HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION
THEN THESE MUTTERED WORDS PASSED HIS LIPS
BUT HERE WERE PALE MUSHROOMS THIRTY TO FORTY FEET HIGH AND CROWNED WITH A CAP OF EQUAL DIAMETER
AND I WILL TAKE THE REST OF THE PROVISIONS AND THE DELICATE INSTRUMENTS BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM THEY WILL GO DOWN BY THEMSELVES HOW SO I ASKED
HOURS PASSED AWAY
I SUPPOSED WE WERE RUNNING AT THE RATE OF THIRTY LEAGUES AN HOUR
AND RAISING HIS FLASK HE EMPTIED IT EVERY DROP BETWEEN MY LIPS
IN THE DISTANCE THE CLOUDS RESEMBLE GREAT BALES OF COTTON PILED UP IN PICTURESQUE DISORDER
NEXT MORNING ON AWAKENING I LOOKED ROUND ME
ICELAND WHICH IS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF ALLUVIAL SOIL IS WHOLLY COMPOSED OF VOLCANIC TUFA THAT IS TO SAY AN AGGLOMERATION OF POROUS ROCKS AND STONES
THE SUPERSTITIOUS ITALIANS WOULD HAVE SET US DOWN FOR FIRE-DEVILS VOMITED OUT OF HELL
AT LAST HIS NERVES CALMED DOWN AND LIKE A MAN EXHAUSTED BY TOO LAVISH AN EXPENDITURE OF VITAL POWER HE SANK BACK EXHAUSTED INTO HIS ARMCHAIR
STILL I AM CONSTRAINED TO CONFESS THAT HITHERTO WE HAVE BEEN WONDERFULLY FAVOURED AND THAT FOR SOME REASON UNKNOWN TO MYSELF WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED OUR JOURNEY UNDER SINGULARLY FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS OF TEMPERATURE
THE BED WAS HARD THE SHELTER NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND OUR POSITION AN ANXIOUS ONE AT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL
I WAS THEREFORE UNDER NO NECESSITY TO INQUIRE THE ROAD WHICH EXPOSES ONE TO MISTAKES WHEN THE ONLY MEDIUM OF INTERCOURSE IS GESTURE
BUT I COULD NOT REMAIN ALONE FOR LONG
MY UNCLE HAS HAD NO DREAMS BUT HE IS OUT OF TEMPER
SPECIMENS OF MAGNIFICENT MARBLES CLOTHED THE WALLS SOME OF A GREYISH AGATE FANTASTICALLY VEINED WITH WHITE OTHERS OF RICH CRIMSON OR YELLOW DASHED WITH SPLOTCHES OF RED
ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION
WHY THAT'S NOTHING
AT THIS RATE WE SHALL BE TWO THOUSAND DAYS OR NEARLY FIVE YEARS AND A HALF IN GETTING TO THE CENTRE NO ANSWER WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THIS RATIONAL CONCLUSION
IN LESS THAN A SECOND WE WERE IN DEEP UNFATHOMABLE DARKNESS
MADEMOISELLE GRAEUBEN WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED MINERALOGIST
THE MINERAL CRUST OF THE GLOBE THREATENED TO BURST UP THE GRANITE FOUNDATIONS TO COME TOGETHER WITH A CRASH THE FISSURE THROUGH WHICH WE WERE HELPLESSLY DRIVEN WOULD BE FILLED UP THE VOID WOULD BE FULL OF CRUSHED FRAGMENTS OF ROCK AND WE POOR WRETCHED MORTALS WERE TO BE BURIED AND ANNIHILATED IN THIS DREADFUL CONSUMMATION
OUR PROVISION OF WATER COULD NOT LAST MORE THAN THREE DAYS
SUPPOSE THAT SOLID ROOF SHOULD CRUMBLE DOWN UPON OUR HEADS
BOYS HAVE BEEN HEARD TO REMARK THAT THAT ORGAN WAS MAGNETISED AND ATTRACTED IRON FILINGS
THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE IN THE MEAL ITSELF
ONE WORD DESCRIBED MY POSITION
SNAEFELL AT LAST SNAEFELL IS 5,000 FEET HIGH
IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED ALREADY WHAT WILL YOU BE BY AND BY
HE WAS A FARMER WHO WAS NOT OBLIGED EITHER TO SOW OR REAP HIS HARVEST BUT MERELY TO GATHER IT IN
LOOK AXEL AND ADMIRE IT ALL
WE ARE GOING TO BE PITCHED OUT EXPELLED TOSSED UP VOMITED SPIT OUT HIGH INTO THE AIR ALONG WITH FRAGMENTS OF ROCK SHOWERS OF ASHES AND SCORIA IN THE MIDST OF A TOWERING RUSH OF SMOKE AND FLAMES
OLAF NIKOLAS OLSEN IN THE PROPORTION OF 1 TO 480,000 OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE ISLAND AND PUBLISHED BY THE ICELANDIC LITERARY SOCIETY
IT IS CALLED SURTURBRAND A VARIETY OF BROWN COAL OR LIGNITE FOUND CHIEFLY IN ICELAND BUT SURELY THEN LIKE OTHER FOSSIL WOOD IT MUST BE AS HARD AS STONE AND CANNOT FLOAT SOMETIMES THAT MAY HAPPEN
DOWN GRANITE ROCKS
THAT OLD DOCUMENT KEPT WORKING IN MY BRAIN
BUT NO OLD BOOK HAD ANY VALUE IN HIS EYES UNLESS IT HAD THE VIRTUE OF BEING NOWHERE ELSE TO BE FOUND OR AT ANY RATE OF BEING ILLEGIBLE
I RETURN TO THE ICELANDER
BUT MY UNCLE WOULD NOT WAIT
A NIGHT'S REST HAS DONE YOU GOOD DONE ME GOOD I EXCLAIMED
NOR WAS THIS ALL
I MIGHT WITH A WORD HAVE LOOSENED THE SCREW OF THE STEEL VICE THAT WAS CRUSHING HIS BRAIN
SOLID ROCK WAS APPEARING IN THE PLACE OF THE LAVA COATING
BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF AND FOR PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK THERE WAS A SATISFACTION IN STORE PROPORTIONED TO HIS DESPERATE ANXIETIES
MY UNCLE WAS GAZING WITH INTENSE AND EAGER INTEREST
I FELT CRUSHED
THE PRIEST AND HIS TALL MEGAERA WERE AWAITING US AT THE DOOR
IF IN A SINGLE DAY I HAVE NOT MET WITH THE WATER THAT WE WANT I SWEAR TO YOU WE WILL RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN SPITE OF MY IRRITATION I WAS MOVED WITH THESE WORDS AS WELL AS WITH THE VIOLENCE MY UNCLE WAS DOING TO HIS OWN WISHES IN MAKING SO HAZARDOUS A PROPOSAL
NO AXEL
WHAT DID THE ICELANDIC SAGE DO
OUR HOSTESS HOSPITABLY OFFERED US HER ASSISTANCE IN UNDRESSING ACCORDING TO ICELANDIC USAGE
WE ATE WITHOUT TALKING AND WENT TO SLEEP WITHOUT REFLECTION
I BEGGED FOR THE HONOUR OF LIGHTING THE FUSE
IT NOW ANSWERS THE PURPOSE OF A SUMPTUOUS LODGE FOR THE DOORKEEPER OF THE STRAITS OF THE SOUND BEFORE WHICH EVERY YEAR THERE PASS FIFTEEN THOUSAND SHIPS OF ALL NATIONS
CALMLY I SAID ALOUD TO MYSELF I AM SURE TO FIND MY COMPANIONS AGAIN
THEN A FEW PACES FARTHER ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE CLIFFS THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNRECOGNISED STREAM OR THE STRANGE OUTLINE OF A ROCK CAME TO THROW ME AGAIN INTO DOUBT
WHO CAN ASSURE US THAT AN ERUPTION IS NOT BREWING AT THIS VERY MOMENT
THAT IS THAT FOR A SPACE OF THIRTY LEAGUES THERE WERE OVER OUR HEADS SOLID BEDS OF ROCK OCEAN CONTINENTS AND TOWNS
HOW ARE YOU
BUT I HAD TO FOLLOW MY COMPANIONS
I WOULD NOT LEAVE HIM IN THIS BOTTOMLESS ABYSS AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION PROMPTED ME TO FLY
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE MADDEST GEOLOGIST UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE STUDIED THE NATURE OF THE ROCKS THAT WE WERE PASSING
I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD
I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY
I THOUGHT MY PALE COUNTENANCE AND MY RED AND SLEEPLESS EYES WOULD WORK UPON GRAEUBEN'S SYMPATHIES AND CHANGE HER MIND
TO BE SURE NOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT GO DOWN OH IF THAT IS ALL YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
THE CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE AGITATION CAUSED BY GREAT LIQUID TORRENTS AND THE MAGNETIC CURRENTS ARE CONTINUALLY TENDING TO DISTURB IT--EVEN WHEN LIVING BEINGS UPON ITS SURFACE MAY FANCY THAT ALL IS QUIET BELOW
THIS DIFFERENCE DEPENDS UPON THE HEAT-CONDUCTING POWER OF THE ROCKS
BUT NOW MY FEARS AGAIN WERE BEGINNING TO GET THE BETTER OF ME
IT WAS THAT OF HANS
WHERE DID THAT SEA TERMINATE
EXTERNAL OBJECTS PRODUCE DECIDED EFFECTS UPON THE BRAIN
BUT THAT WHICH FORMED STEPS UNDER OUR FEET BECAME STALACTITES OVERHEAD
FOR THREE DAYS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE EACH OTHER HEAR A WORD
EVERY HILLOCK EVERY ROCK AND STONE EVERY PROJECTING SURFACE HAD ITS SHARE OF THE BEAMING TORRENT AND THREW ITS SHADOW ON THE GROUND
WITH HIS HAND HE WAS EXAMINING THE PERPENDICULAR WALL AND IN A FEW MORE MINUTES HE CONTINUED
THE CAPTAIN M
TRAVELLERS WHO PENETRATE INTO THE WILDS OF CENTRAL AFRICA AND INTO THE PATHLESS FORESTS OF THE NEW WORLD ARE OBLIGED TO WATCH OVER EACH OTHER BY NIGHT
THE WIND WAS FROM THE NORTH-WEST
INTENSITY OF LIGHT THE SAME
PERHAPS IT MIGHT
WHEN I REMOVED MY HAND IT WAS BLACK
HERE HANS ADVANCED ONLY WITH EXTREME PRECAUTION SOUNDING HIS WAY WITH HIS IRON-POINTED POLE TO DISCOVER ANY CREVASSES IN IT
THOUGHT I JUST THE PLACE WE WANT TO END OUR DAYS IN
I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN
AMONGST THESE STREAMS I RECOGNISED OUR FAITHFUL TRAVELLING COMPANION THE HANSBACH COMING TO LOSE ITS LITTLE VOLUME QUIETLY IN THE MIGHTY SEA JUST AS IF IT HAD DONE NOTHING ELSE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD
BESIDES I SAID TO MYSELF WHERE'S THE RISK
THEN HE ASKED HANS FOR HIS REASON
HE SHAKES HIS HEAD NEGATIVELY
NO WORDS COULD TELL IT
HANS IS RIGHT
HANS WAS AFTER ME PRECEDING MY UNCLE
HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE
BUT NOW WE WERE COMING INTO THAT DELIGHTFUL GREENERY AND I WAS SUFFERING GREATLY FROM HUNGER AND THIRST
THE VAULT THAT SPANNED THE SPACE ABOVE THE SKY IF IT COULD BE CALLED SO SEEMED COMPOSED OF VAST PLAINS OF CLOUD SHIFTING AND VARIABLE VAPOURS WHICH BY THEIR CONDENSATION MUST AT CERTAIN TIMES FALL IN TORRENTS OF RAIN
I TOOK UP THE TELESCOPE AND SCANNED THE WHOLE HORIZON AND FOUND IT EVERYWHERE A DESERT SEA
BUT WE SHALL BE REDUCED TO VERY GREAT WEAKNESS AT LAST AND OUR LAST HOUR IS NOT FAR OFF WELL IF THERE IS A CHANCE OF SAFETY IF A MOMENT FOR ACTIVE EXERTION PRESENTS ITSELF WHERE SHOULD WE FIND THE REQUIRED STRENGTH IF WE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE ENFEEBLED BY HUNGER WELL UNCLE WHEN THIS BIT OF MEAT HAS BEEN DEVOURED WHAT SHALL WE HAVE LEFT NOTHING AXEL NOTHING AT ALL
THE PROFESSOR SAW THAT MY LIMBS WERE REFUSING TO PERFORM THEIR OFFICE AND IN SPITE OF HIS IMPATIENCE HE DECIDED ON STOPPING
I INFER THAT WE ARE NOT IN GERMANY HE PUT THE SAME QUESTION IN ENGLISH
THE MORE REASON WHY WE SHOULD GO UP
OR WAS HE DETERMINED TO EXAMINE THIS PASSAGE TO ITS FARTHEST EXTREMITY
I HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED PACES BEFORE INCONTESTABLE PROOFS PRESENTED THEMSELVES
THE HEAVILY VOLUTED CUMULUS CLOUDS LOWER GLOOMILY AND THREATENINGLY
HIS AUDACITY HIS JOY AND HIS CONVICTIONS WERE MAGNIFICENT TO BEHOLD
BUT WOULD THIS STATE OF THINGS LAST IN THE STRANGE PLACE WE HAD COME TO
IT WAS HANS OWN FAMILY THAT IS HIS UNCLES AND COUSINS WHO GAVE US HOSPITALITY
I BEGAN TO SAY TO MYSELF THAT I WAS EXAGGERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCUMENT
AND IF THERE IS CENTRAL HEAT MAY WE NOT THENCE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS IN PROCESS OF DIMINUTION MY GOOD UNCLE IF YOU WILL ENTER INTO THE LEGION OF SPECULATION I CAN DISCUSS THE MATTER NO LONGER BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE HIGHEST NAMES HAVE COME TO THE SUPPORT OF MY VIEWS
A CRATER BROKE OPEN AT ONE OF ITS SUMMITS
THE GRANITE TUNNEL WINDING FROM SIDE TO SIDE EARNED US PAST UNEXPECTED TURNS AND SEEMED ALMOST TO FORM A LABYRINTH
BUT THE HOSPITALITY OF OUR HOST MORE DANISH THAN ICELANDIC REMINDED ME OF THE HEROES OF OLD
THAT IS THE RUSTLING NOISE OF WIND
BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND AS LONG AS WE WERE APPROACHING THE CENTRE AT ALL WE FELT THAT WE MUST NOT COMPLAIN
I HAD AN IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE DROPPING VERTICALLY
WE HAD EXCHANGED THE BLEAK REGIONS OF PERPETUAL SNOW AND OF IMPENETRABLE BARRIERS OF ICE FOR THOSE OF BRIGHTNESS AND THE RICH HUES OF ALL GLORIOUS THINGS WE HAD LEFT OVER OUR HEADS THE MURKY SKY AND COLD FOGS OF THE FRIGID ZONE TO REVEL UNDER THE AZURE SKY OF ITALY
THEN WE SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
THE PASSAGE WAS ENCUMBERED WITH ROPE LADDERS KNOTTED CORDS TORCHES FLASKS GRAPPLING IRONS ALPENSTOCKS PICKAXES IRON SHOD STICKS ENOUGH TO LOAD TEN MEN
AFTER WAITING FORTY-EIGHT HOURS ON THE 31 ST OF AUGUST A SMALL CRAFT TOOK US TO MESSINA WHERE A FEW DAYS REST COMPLETELY REMOVED THE EFFECT OF OUR FATIGUES
BUT YOU MIGHT HEAR IF YOU WOULD LISTEN
IF THE AIR IS CONDENSED BY THE PRESSURE OF THIS COLUMN OF WATER WE SHALL BE CRUSHED AXEL REPLIED THE PROFESSOR WITH PERFECT COOLNESS OUR SITUATION IS ALMOST DESPERATE
A PHENOMENON WAS UNFOLDING IN WHICH ELECTRICITY WOULD PLAY THE PRINCIPAL PART
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF SAFETY LEFT YES I DO
SAELLVERTU SAID THE HUNTER
ON THE FRONT OF THE SECOND THE TITLE-PAGE HE NOTICED A SORT OF STAIN WHICH LOOKED LIKE AN INK BLOT
BESIDES THE DENSE AND BREEZY AIR INVIGORATED ME SUPPLYING MORE OXYGEN TO MY LUNGS
MECHANICALLY I SWEPT THE GROUND WITH MY HANDS
THE CHRONOMETER SOON INFORMED ME OF THAT FACT
I NOTE THE FACT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN IT
I SEIZED NOT ONLY THE PAPER BUT SAKNUSSEMM'S PARCHMENT
WAS HANS GOING TO FORSAKE US
THOMSEN BROUGHT US LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO COUNT TRAMPE THE GOVERNOR OF ICELAND M
THERE ARE EVEN CAPITALS IN THE MIDDLE OF WORDS AND COMMAS TOO JUST AS IN SAKNUSSEMM'S PARCHMENT I CONSIDERED THESE REMARKS VERY CLEVER
WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA ON AN ISLAND OF THE AEOLIAN ARCHIPELAGO IN THE ANCIENT STRONGYLE WHERE AEOLUS KEPT THE WINDS AND THE STORMS CHAINED UP TO BE LET LOOSE AT HIS WILL
THIS LAVA STREAM DEVIATED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
A COAL MINE I CRIED
THE WHISTLE SOUNDED THE ENGINE STARTED WE WERE OFF
TO MAKE MYSELF HEARD I MUST SPEAK ALONG THIS WALL WHICH WOULD CONDUCT THE SOUND OF MY VOICE JUST AS WIRE CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY
PROVIDENCE SEEMS TO HAVE PRESERVED IN THIS IMMENSE CONSERVATORY THE ANTEDILUVIAN PLANTS WHICH THE WISDOM OF PHILOSOPHERS HAS SO SAGACIOUSLY PUT TOGETHER AGAIN IT IS A CONSERVATORY AXEL
THOSE WHO COULD SPEAK KEPT REPEATING SAELLVERTU IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE TONE
I NO LONGER SEE HIS SCALY ARMOUR
BUT THAT A MAN A LIVING MAN AND THEREFORE WHOLE GENERATIONS DOUBTLESS BESIDES SHOULD BE BURIED THERE IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH IS IMPOSSIBLE
IT IS STILL SUBTLE AND DIFFUSIVE BUT WHATEVER LITTLE THERE MAY BE THE EYE STILL CATCHES THAT LITTLE
THE ERUPTION TOOK PLACE AND COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE OF THE BALL SUCH A HEAT THAT IT COULD NOT BE HELD IN THE HAND IN TRUTH I WAS BEGINNING TO BE SHAKEN BY THE PROFESSOR'S ARGUMENTS BESIDES WHICH HE GAVE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT TO THEM BY HIS USUAL ARDOUR AND FERVENT ENTHUSIASM
LOOK AT ITS VAST JAWS AND ITS ROWS OF TEETH
THE PROFESSOR WAS WATCHING THE HAND OF THE CHRONOMETER
ON SATURDAY AT SIX WE STARTED AFRESH
AND THAT THREATENING VOLCANO FAR AWAY IN THE SOUTH WAS THE FIERCE ETNA
WE MUST FLY
THE WIND WAS BLOWING VIOLENTLY
I BEGAN TO FEEL THE PANGS OF A VIOLENT HUNGER
A FEW HOURS PASSED AWAY
WILL NOT MONSIEUR TAKE ANY SUPPER TO-NIGHT AND POOR MARTHA HAD TO GO AWAY UNANSWERED
ALL THIS FOSSIL WORLD RISES TO LIFE AGAIN IN MY VIVID IMAGINATION
I COULD NOT SET IT RIGHT AND ITS LIGHT WAS PALING AND WOULD SOON DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER
FAHR THEREFORE THE SAVANTS ARE WRONG BY 2,705 DEG AND THE PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IS A MISTAKE
THIS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
FRIDRIKSSEN PROFESSOR OF NATURAL SCIENCES AT THE SCHOOL OF REJKIAVIK WAS A DELIGHTFUL MAN AND HIS FRIENDSHIP BECAME VERY PRECIOUS TO ME
THUS THE FIRST NIGHT IN THE CRATER PASSED AWAY
UNCLE LIEDENBROCK IS GOING TO MAKE US ALL FAST UNTIL HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN DECIPHERING AN UNDECIPHERABLE SCRAWL OH MY DEAR
A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
ALAS
ALAS
ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
BUT SILENCE DO YOU HEAR ME
AT LAST AT ELEVEN IN THE SUNLIGHT NIGHT THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL WAS REACHED AND BEFORE GOING IN FOR SHELTER INTO THE CRATER I HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THE MIDNIGHT SUN AT HIS LOWEST POINT GILDING WITH HIS PALE RAYS THE ISLAND THAT SLEPT AT MY FEET
AT STAPI I BEHELD THIS PHENOMENON IN ALL ITS BEAUTY
THE SYSTEM IS WELL DEVELOPED IN THE REGION OF SHROPSHIRE ETC ONCE INHABITED BY THE SILURES UNDER CARACTACUS OR CARADOC
WITH A FEVERISH HAND I WAS ABOUT TO FLING IT ALL UPON THE COALS AND UTTERLY DESTROY AND ABOLISH THIS DANGEROUS SECRET WHEN THE STUDY DOOR OPENED AND MY UNCLE APPEARED
AND THERE WAS NO HOPE LEFT OF BEING ABLE TO DISSIPATE THE PALPABLE DARKNESS
THEY FORMED SETTLEMENTS OF DOMES PLACED IN CLOSE ARRAY LIKE THE ROUND THATCHED ROOFS OF A CENTRAL AFRICAN CITY
I DREAD TO SEE ONE OF THESE MONSTERS DARTING FORTH FROM ITS SUBMARINE CAVERNS
WHAT HONOUR WILL FALL UPON HERR LIEDENBROCK AND SO BE REFLECTED UPON HIS COMPANION
WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
BUT THEY ARE LIKE THE PARISHIONERS WHO HAVE NO WATCHES AND DO WITHOUT
FROM THAT TIME IT HAS QUIETED DOWN MORE AND MORE AND NOW IT IS NO LONGER RECKONED AMONG ACTIVE VOLCANOES TO SUCH POSITIVE STATEMENTS I COULD MAKE NO REPLY
I COULD NOT HEAR EVEN THE BEATING OF MY HEART
I FOUND THAT OUT FOR CERTAIN WHEN SUPPER-TIME CAME
AND NOW MY TURN COMES
HE BY A SNAPPING MOTION OF HIS JAWS CONVEYS HIS IDEAS TO ME
ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS FEELINGS WAS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE POINT ALONE
WHAT DID THE MAN MEAN
IF I AM MISTAKEN I CAN BUT TRY SPANISH FRENCH ITALIAN GREEK OR HEBREW
WE HAVE MADE TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES SINCE WE LEFT AXEL ISLAND
IT TOOK US MORE THAN AN HOUR TO CROSS THE FIORD
WHEN I LIFTED MY HEAD I PERCEIVED THE GRADUAL CONTRACTION OF ITS APERTURE
M
M
M
M
M
M
M
M
M
M
OUR COURSE HAS BEEN THE SAME ALL ALONG AND I BELIEVE THIS SHORE IS SOUTH-EAST OF PORT GRAEUBEN WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS
NOW ERUPTIONS ARE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY CERTAIN WELL-KNOWN PHENOMENA
IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA
WHAT IS THAT KEY
THEN MY DREAM BACKED EVEN FARTHER STILL INTO THE AGES BEFORE THE CREATION OF LIVING BEINGS
AND NEVER COULD MAN HAVE GIVEN IT SO WIDE A STRETCH
HE UNCOILED A CORD OF THE THICKNESS OF A FINGER AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG
THE COMPANY OF SUCH A TALENTED MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SERVICEABLE BUT THE DUTIES OF YOUR PROFESSION I AM GLAD TO THINK THAT OUR HOST IN THE INNOCENCE OF HIS ICELANDIC SOUL WAS BLIND TO THE TRANSPARENT ARTIFICES OF MY UNCLE
HIS GREAT DISCOVERY IS HIS INDUCTION COIL WHICH PRODUCES A POWERFUL STREAM OF ELECTRICITY
IF UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD EXPLORED THIS GALLERY WITH TORCHES A TERRIBLE EXPLOSION WOULD HAVE PUT AN END TO TRAVELLING AND TRAVELLERS AT ONE STROKE
IT IS THEY I REPEATED
IT WAS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST ONE
WE WERE MOVING OVER GREY ROCKS OF DENSE AND MASSIVE FORMATION WHICH IN COOLING HAD FORMED INTO HEXAGONAL PRISMS
NOT AT ALL THAT HE WAS OVER-ANXIOUS ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIS CLASS OR ABOUT THE DEGREE OF ATTENTION WITH WHICH THEY LISTENED TO HIM OR THE SUCCESS WHICH MIGHT EVENTUALLY CROWN HIS LABOURS
MY KNEES BEGAN TO FAIL
I COMMUNICATED MY DOUBTS TO MY UNCLE
FOR HALF AN HOUR WE WANDERED FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THE DAMP SHADES AND IT WAS A COMFORTABLE AND PLEASANT CHANGE TO ARRIVE ONCE MORE UPON THE SEA SHORE
THE SAIL
AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE YOU WILL SEE IT RISE LIKE THE ATLANTIC ITSELF AT THE SAME MOMENT WE REACHED THE SAND ON THE SHORE AND THE WAVES WERE BY SLOW DEGREES ENCROACHING ON THE SHORE
A DEAF MAN WOULD SOON LEARN TO HEAR PERFECTLY BUT WON'T THIS DENSITY AUGMENT YES
GEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU NEXT DAY TUESDAY JUNE 30 AT 6 A.M THE DESCENT BEGAN AGAIN
THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN-INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
BUT SUCH TRIALS WERE WANTED TO BRING OUT THE PROFESSOR'S TENDERER QUALITIES
CHAPTER XXIV
AT SEVEN WE HAD ASCENDED THE TWO THOUSAND STEPS OF THIS GRAND STAIRCASE AND WE HAD ATTAINED A BULGE IN THE MOUNTAIN A KIND OF BED ON WHICH RESTED THE CONE PROPER OF THE CRATER
OFTEN THESE CHAINS OF BARREN ROCKS MADE A DIP TOWARDS THE SEA AND ENCROACHED UPON THE SCANTY PASTURAGE
THERE THEY STOOD IN THOUSANDS
CRYSTALS OF OPAQUE QUARTZ SET WITH LIMPID TEARS OF GLASS AND HANGING LIKE CLUSTERED CHANDELIERS FROM THE VAULTED ROOF SEEMED AS IT WERE TO KINDLE AND FORM A SUDDEN ILLUMINATION AS WE PASSED ON OUR WAY
CHAPTER XIX
WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT HE ASKED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF SILENCE
DO YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOW ONLY 1,500 LEAGUES TO THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE IS THAT ALL I CRIED
IF MY COMPANIONS MOVED BUT A FEW STEPS AWAY THE ACOUSTIC PHENOMENON WOULD CEASE
VERY WELL NOW IT IS OUR TURN NOW I ASK ANY SENSIBLE MAN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HEAR THOSE WORDS WITHOUT A SHUDDER
A LARGE MASS HAD BEEN RENT ASUNDER BY A SUBTERRANEAN DISTURBANCE
AFTER OUR DELICIOUS REPAST OF FRUITS AND COLD CLEAR WATER WE SET OFF AGAIN TO REACH THE PORT OF STROMBOLI
THE MUSCLES OF MY THROAT UNTIL THEN CONTRACTED NOW RELAXED AGAIN
AT LAST SHE SAID AXEL MY DEAR GRAEUBEN THAT WILL BE A SPLENDID JOURNEY I GAVE A BOUND AT THESE WORDS
GAIMARD AND ROBERT ON THE FRENCH CORVETTE LA RECHERCHE 1 AND LATELY THE OBSERVATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO CAME IN THE REINE HORTENSE HAVE ADDED MATERIALLY TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF ICELAND
AND HANSBACH IT WAS FROM THAT MOMENT
DO YOU UNDERSTAND I HAD SEIZED HANS BY THE ARM
IT MERELY AUGMENTS ITS INTENSITY
THEY RECEIVE FROM THE DANISH GOVERNMENT A RIDICULOUSLY SMALL PITTANCE AND THEY GET FROM THE PARISH THE FOURTH PART OF THE TITHE WHICH DOES NOT COME TO SIXTY MARKS A YEAR ABOUT L4 HENCE THE NECESSITY TO WORK FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD
YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT YOURSELF UNDER THE RAYS OF A VERTICAL SUN IN A TROPICAL REGION AT NOONDAY AND THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER
BUT BEING CARRIED TO A DEPTH OF FIVE LEAGUES BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
YET A FEW INVOLUNTARY OBSERVATIONS CONFIRMED ME IN MY VIEW
I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
WHAT IS THE MATTER SHOUTED MY UNCLE
TO TELL THE PLAIN TRUTH I PITIED HIM
IT HAD CEASED TO ACT PROPERLY
HE THE MAN OF IMPULSE COUNSELLED PATIENCE AND COOLNESS
I SAT DOWN IN DESPAIR
TO HAVE IN ONE'S POSSESSION A LIVING SPECIMEN IS A HAPPY EVENT FOR A NATURALIST BUT TO WHAT FAMILY DOES IT BELONG IT IS OF THE ORDER OF GANOIDS OF THE FAMILY OF THE CEPHALASPIDAE
I THANKED MY UNCLE WITH CLASPED HANDS
THEY POSSESSED A PERFECT ORGANISATION GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH
EVENING CAME OR RATHER THE TIME CAME WHEN SLEEP WEIGHS DOWN THE WEARY EYELIDS FOR THERE IS NO NIGHT HERE AND THE CEASELESS LIGHT WEARIES THE EYES WITH ITS PERSISTENCY JUST AS IF WE WERE SAILING UNDER AN ARCTIC SUN
THE WATER IS AT THE BOILING POINT I CRIED
THIS INLET WAS CONFINED BETWEEN WALLS OF ROCK PRECIPICES CROWNED BY SHARP PEAKS 2,000 FEET HIGH AND REMARKABLE FOR THE BROWN STRATA WHICH SEPARATED THE BEDS OF REDDISH TUFF
HE SHARED WITH US OUR FRUGAL BREAKFAST
IT TURNED UPON SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS AS BEFITS PHILOSOPHERS
IF WE ARE NEITHER DROWNED NOR SHATTERED TO PIECES NOR STARVED TO DEATH THERE IS STILL THE CHANCE THAT WE MAY BE BURNED ALIVE AND REDUCED TO ASHES AT THIS HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND RETURNED TO HIS THOUGHTS
I WANTED TO KNOW IF THE NOISE WOULD BE REPEATED
MY UNCLE'S LAST WORDS ECHOED PAINFULLY IN MY EARS
I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS OBJECT IN MY POSSESSION WELL THIS IS STRANGE NO AXEL IT IS VERY SIMPLE
AN HOUR PASSED AWAY
TVA SAYS HE
THIS WORK REPLIED MY UNCLE FIRING UP WITH RENEWED ENTHUSIASM THIS WORK IS THE HEIMS KRINGLA OF SNORRE TURLLESON THE MOST FAMOUS ICELANDIC AUTHOR OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
THE VICARAGE BROUGHTON-IN-FURNESS
WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES
YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
I ABSTAINED FROM COMMUNICATING THESE FEARS TO PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
MY DEAR AXEL IT IS A GRAND THING TO DEVOTE YOURSELF TO SCIENCE
IT IS THE ICHTHYOSAURUS THE FISH LIZARD THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE ANCIENT MONSTERS OF THE DEEP AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS A PLESIOSAURUS ALMOST LIZARD A SERPENT ARMOURED WITH THE CARAPACE AND THE PADDLES OF A TURTLE
WE WERE SOON IN THE OPEN COUNTRY IF ONE MAY GIVE THAT NAME TO A VAST EXTENT OF MOUNDS OF VOLCANIC PRODUCTS
WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW NOTHING IN TRUTH I HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY
IT IS EVIDENT I CRIED THE MARINE DEPOSITS FORMED IN THE SECOND PERIOD THESE SHALES LIMESTONES AND SANDSTONES
ONE OF THE MOST CURIOUS VOLCANOES AND THE CRATER OF WHICH HAS SCARCELY EVER BEEN VISITED IS IT EXTINCT OH YES
INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
I COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY
THE PLANTS SUNK UNDERNEATH THE WATERS FORMED BY DEGREES INTO VAST ACCUMULATED MASSES
FOR THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE BEDS AND THE TRANSITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS BECAME MORE AND MORE DECIDED
THAT'S NOT AN ISLAND I CRIED SCEPTICALLY
BUT WHAT OF SNEFFELS I WAS HOPING THAT THIS QUESTION WOULD BE UNANSWERABLE
THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT 250 FEET IN CIRCUIT SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
SOME DAYS WE ADVANCED NEARER TO THE CENTRE BY A LEAGUE AND A HALF OR NEARLY TWO LEAGUES
THERE WAS NO TORCH NO LAMP YET CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS GLIMPSES OF LIGHT CAME FROM WITHOUT THROUGH A NARROW OPENING IN THE GROTTO
TEETH I CRIED CONSIDERING THE IRON BAR WITH MORE ATTENTION
WAS MY UNCLE BESIDE HIMSELF
IS HE MAD CRIED THE PROFESSOR
GOD DAG SAID HE
THE DINNER-HOUR IS PAST AND I DID NOT KNOW IT
THEY GAVE US FOOD AND CLOTHING
IN TWENTY MINUTES WE REACHED A VAST OPEN SPACE
THE DESCENT BECAME STEEPER
CHAPTER XVIII
THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER
WE MUST HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND
WHAT ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THEM
AND A SPECIES OF PTERICHTHYS
AND SO WE WENT ON UNTIL 12.17 THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN WE OVERTOOK HANS WHO HAD STOPPED
THE EMOTIONS OF THAT DAY WERE BREAKING MY HEART
IT WILL FLOW DOWN AND WILL BOTH GUIDE AND REFRESH US THAT IS WELL PLANNED I CRIED
THE VALKYRIA KEPT AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE COAST TAKING A WESTERLY COURSE AMIDST GREAT SHOALS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
HE HAD BEEN WITHIN A HAIR'S BREADTH OF READING THIS LATIN DOCUMENT FROM END TO END
DON'T LET US LOSE A MOMENT
NEVERTHELESS THEY SOON CAME TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
WE ADVANCED IN SILENCE BATHED IN LUMINOUS ELECTRIC FLUID
BUT ABOUT TEN THIS UPWARD TENDENCY BECAME SO EVIDENT AND THEREFORE SO FATIGUING THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLACKEN MY PACE
IS IT RIVETED TO THE PLANKS
AMONGST OTHER DOCUMENTS A SHEET OF PAPER CAREFULLY FOLDED BORE THE HEADING OF THE DANISH CONSULATE WITH THE SIGNATURE OF W
LET US FILL THE WATER BOTTLE AND OUR FLASKS AND THEN STOP UP THE OPENING MY ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED SO FAR AS GETTING IN A SUPPLY
WHAT YOU HEAR IS THE RUSHING OF A TORRENT A TORRENT I EXCLAIMED
HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED
1 1 THE SHEPHERD OF GIGANTIC HERDS AND HUGER STILL HIMSELF YES TRULY HUGER STILL HIMSELF
THE HOUSE IN THE KOENIGSTRASSE MY POOR DEAR GRAEUBEN THAT KIND SOUL MARTHA FLITTED LIKE VISIONS BEFORE MY EYES AND IN THE DISMAL MOANINGS WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME REACHED MY EARS I THOUGHT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE ROAR OF THE TRAFFIC OF THE GREAT CITIES UPON EARTH
I TOOK THE ARMS
HERE WE ARE EIGHTY-FIVE LEAGUES SOUTH-EAST OF SNAEFELL AND I RECKON THAT WE ARE AT A DEPTH OF SIXTEEN LEAGUES SIXTEEN LEAGUES I CRIED
IT WAS IN VAIN THAT WE TOOK UP FRAGMENTS OF GRANITE AND STUFFED THEM IN WITH TOW WE ONLY SCALDED OUR HANDS WITHOUT SUCCEEDING
THE GREATER PART OF THESE BORE IMPRESSIONS OF PRIMITIVE ORGANISMS
I RACKED MY BRAIN FOR A SOLUTION OF THIS IMPRACTICABLE PROBLEM
FOR OF COURSE MY UNCLE WAS RIGHT AND WISER MEN THAN HIS NEPHEW WOULD HAVE HAD SOME TROUBLE TO REFUTE HIS STATEMENTS
DON'T BE A COWARD
I CREEP CLOSE TO HIM
NOW I'LL READ IT I CRIED AFTER HAVING WELL DISTENDED MY LUNGS WITH AIR
WE FELT VIOLENT SHOCKS WHENEVER WE WERE BORNE HEAVILY AGAINST THE CRAGGY PROJECTIONS
PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
IT WILL BE EASILY CONCEIVED THAT AFTER AN IMPRISONMENT OF FORTY SEVEN DAYS IN A NARROW GALLERY IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF PHYSICAL ENJOYMENT TO BREATHE A MOIST AIR IMPREGNATED WITH SALINE PARTICLES
AS FOR ME AFTER LONG RESISTANCE I WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP AND FELL OFF AT THE END OF THE SOFA WHILE UNCLE LIEDENBROCK WENT ON CALCULATING AND RUBBING OUT HIS CALCULATIONS
I HAD KEPT IT AS A PRECIOUS TREASURE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY FLASK
THEN I OBSERVED MINGLED TOGETHER IN CONFUSION TREES OF COUNTRIES FAR APART ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE
THERE WAS NOTHING
EVER SINCE WE ARRIVED AT STAPI I HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED WITH THE IMPORTANT QUESTION YOU HAVE JUST OPENED FOR WE MUST NOT BE GUILTY OF IMPRUDENCE NO INDEED I REPLIED WITH FORCIBLE EMPHASIS
THE SOUL OF THE PROFESSOR HAD PASSED INTO ME
THE MOST VIVID FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ARE MINGLED WITH THE VIOLENT CRASH OF CONTINUOUS THUNDER
I VERY MUCH APPROVE OF YOUR BEGINNING WITH THAT VOLCANO M
I AM GOING TO THE LIBRARY
IT PENETRATES DIRECTLY DOWNWARD AND IN A FEW HOURS IT WILL BRING US TO THE GRANITE ROCKS
SHE WAS TAKING TO REJKIAVIK COAL HOUSEHOLD GOODS EARTHENWARE WOOLLEN CLOTHING AND A CARGO OF WHEAT
AND SUPPOSE HE TACKLED ME AGAIN WITH THIS LOGOMACHY WHICH MIGHT VAINLY HAVE BEEN SET BEFORE ANCIENT OEDIPUS
THIS WAS TO BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD
FOR A MOMENT I FEARED THE WORDS MIGHT BE MY OWN BROUGHT BACK BY THE ECHO
THEN THERE WAS A ROW OF PHIALS CONTAINING DEXTRINE ALCOHOLIC ETHER LIQUID ACETATE OF LEAD VINEGAR AND AMMONIA DRUGS WHICH AFFORDED ME NO COMFORT
AT HALF-PAST SIX THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE STATION
BUT I WAS COMPELLED TO RISE TO STAND UP TO LOOK
I THEREFORE ROSE
COAST THIRTY LEAGUES TO LEEWARD
IS IT YOU YES YES I REPLIED
BUT THEN THESE ROOFS ARE MEADOWS OF COMPARATIVE FERTILITY
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE
HE WON'T HAVE ANY AND HIS SUPPER HE WON'T HAVE ANY WHAT CRIED MARTHA WITH CLASPED HANDS
I HOPE NOT I ROSE AND TRIED TO LOOK AROUND ME
SLEEP NOW AND TO-MORROW I WILL TELL YOU ALL BUT DO TELL ME WHAT TIME IT IS AND WHAT DAY IT IS SUNDAY THE 8TH OF AUGUST AND IT IS TEN AT NIGHT
HE MADE NO MOVEMENT
I MUST NEGLECT NOTHING HE SAID
AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD
THE TOTAL DARKNESS MADE ME TOTALLY BLIND
ITS SNOWY SUMMIT BY AN OPTICAL ILLUSION NOT UNFREQUENT IN MOUNTAINS SEEMED CLOSE TO US AND YET HOW MANY WEARY HOURS IT TOOK TO REACH IT
TO THE ERUPTION SUCCEEDED OTHER VOLCANIC PHENOMENA
ON OUR ARRIVAL THE MASTER CAME WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND WITHOUT MORE CEREMONY HE BECKONED US TO FOLLOW HIM
NOW YOU ARE TOO FAINT AND WEAK
MY UNCLE HAD BEATEN ME WITH THE WEAPONS OF SCIENCE
AT THREE HUNDRED YARDS FROM US THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT
BUT OTHER FACTS OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PECULIAR NATURE CAME TO REVEAL TO ME BY DEGREES THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE
GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST-TERTIARY SYSTEM
I LAID MY FINGER SUCCESSIVELY UPON EVERY LETTER
MY UNCLE SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO TO SLEEP
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY OWN EYES
I FELT AS IF I WAS IN SOME DISTANT PLANET URANUS OR NEPTUNE--AND IN THE PRESENCE OF PHENOMENA OF WHICH MY TERRESTRIAL EXPERIENCE GAVE ME NO COGNISANCE
A BOAT DER REPLIED HANS POINTING TO ONE
I LAID HOLD OF THE END OF THE MATCH
IS THERE NO WAY FARTHER YES
TO EXCHANGE A WORD IS IMPOSSIBLE
NEJ REPLIED HANS
NONE BUT SOME WEIGHTY MOTIVE COULD HAVE INDUCED SO QUIET A MAN TO FORFEIT HIS SLEEP
AND IF THERE WAS ALWAYS A FULL AUDIENCE TO HONOUR THE LIEDENBROCK COURSES I SHOULD BE SORRY TO CONJECTURE HOW MANY CAME TO MAKE MERRY AT MY UNCLE'S EXPENSE
HITHERTO OUR TOIL HAD OVERCOME ALL DIFFICULTIES NOW DIFFICULTIES WOULD SPRING UP AT EVERY STEP
ITS SURFACE WAS COMPOSED OF A GREAT NUMBER OF METALS SUCH AS POTASSIUM AND SODIUM WHICH HAVE THE PECULIAR PROPERTY OF IGNITING AT THE MERE CONTACT WITH AIR AND WATER
BUT WHAT ON EARTH IS THEIR MEANING RUNIC LETTERS APPEARING TO MY MIND TO BE AN INVENTION OF THE LEARNED TO MYSTIFY THIS POOR WORLD I WAS NOT SORRY TO SEE MY UNCLE SUFFERING THE PANGS OF MYSTIFICATION
WHY THAT IS THE NAME OF ANOTHER ICELANDER A SAVANT OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY A CELEBRATED ALCHEMIST I GAZED AT MY UNCLE WITH SATISFACTORY ADMIRATION
I WAS TOO FAR AHEAD
WHERE DID ERROR BEGIN
OH THE INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE OF PRESSING THOSE COOL SWEET FRUITS TO OUR LIPS AND EATING GRAPES BY MOUTHFULS OFF THE RICH FULL BUNCHES
CHAPTER XXVI
IN 1816 WE FOUNDED A PROSPEROUS LITERARY SOCIETY
HIS HEAD HUGE AND UNSHAPELY AS A BUFFALO'S WAS HALF HIDDEN IN THE THICK AND TANGLED GROWTH OF HIS UNKEMPT HAIR
WHY WAS HE LEAVING US
WE STOOD AMAZED THUNDERSTRUCK AT THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A HERD OF MARINE MONSTERS
DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A BINDING
WE HAVE BEEN CARRIED UNDER ENGLAND UNDER THE CHANNEL UNDER FRANCE PERHAPS UNDER THE WHOLE OF EUROPE
THE FALL UPON OUR FATED RAFT OF THIS ELECTRIC GLOBE HAS MAGNETISED EVERY IRON ARTICLE ON BOARD
AND HANS SIGNALLED THE START
CHAPTER XXIII
GRAUBEN
I GLIDE LIKE A SHADE AMONGST ARBORESCENT FERNS TREADING WITH UNSTEADY FEET THE COLOURED MARLS AND THE PARTICOLOURED CLAYS
I AM NOW YOUR BETROTHED
I FOLLOWED HIM
AND NOW MY LIMBS WERE FAILING BENEATH ME
IT WAS COMPOSED OF TREES OF MODERATE HEIGHT FORMED LIKE UMBRELLAS WITH EXACT GEOMETRICAL OUTLINES
WORSE THAN THAT UNBEARABLE
HIS ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT TO TERMINATE WITH OUR ARRIVAL AT STAPI
BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS
FOREIGNERS HAVE THEIR LIBRARIES AT HOME AND THE FIRST ESSENTIAL FOR LABOURING PEOPLE IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE EDUCATED
THE FORCE OF THE JET SHOWS THAT NO DOUBT ANSWERED MY UNCLE
ON OUR RIGHT THE CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS WAS INDEFINITELY PROLONGED LIKE AN IMMENSE SYSTEM OF NATURAL FORTIFICATIONS OF WHICH WE WERE FOLLOWING THE COUNTER-SCARP OR LESSER STEEP
ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER
INTENSE HEAT CONVERTS SOLID BODIES INTO THICK FLUIDS
AND HALF THE TIME BETWEEN MY CALL AND YOUR ANSWER WILL EXACTLY INDICATE THAT WHICH MY VOICE WILL TAKE IN COMING TO YOU JUST SO MY UNCLE ARE YOU READY YES NOW ATTENTION
YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO BE BETTER FOR YOU HAVE SLEPT QUIETLY
MY OPINION IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING IT CANNOT BE
I GAVE WAY IN NO RESPECT TO DAVY'S THEORY
THAT IS INDEED THE MURMURING OF WAVES
HIS EYES SET IN A LARGE AND INGENUOUS FACE SEEMED TO ME VERY INTELLIGENT
IT EXTENDS ALONG THE INNER EDGE OF A SMALL FIORD INCLOSED BETWEEN BASALTIC WALLS OF THE STRANGEST CONSTRUCTION
CHAPTER XXV
DID NOT GALILEO DO THE SAME BY SATURN
BESIDES THIS SEEMED TO CONFIRM THE INDICATIONS OF THE NEEDLE AND TO SHOW THAT WE HAD AGAINST OUR WILL RETURNED TO THE NORTH OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA
IT MUST BE SO THE PROFESSOR'S IMAGINATION TOOK FIRE AT THIS HYPOTHESIS
NOW SAID HE WE WILL REPLENISH OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WITH THE RAIN WHICH THE STORM HAS LEFT IN ALL THESE GRANITE BASINS
ASCEND THE INNUMERABLE FIORDS THAT INDENT THOSE SEA-BEATEN SHORES AND STOP AT THE SIXTY-FIFTH DEGREE OF LATITUDE
AHA SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR WITH A LOUD LAUGH
FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM
THAT COMPASS WELL SEE ITS POLES ARE REVERSED REVERSED YES THEY POINT THE WRONG WAY MY UNCLE LOOKED HE COMPARED AND THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH HIS TRIUMPHANT LEAP OF EXULTATION
AND OUR PARTY WITH MYSELF AT THE HEAD MADE FOR IT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY
MARTHA WAS DISTRACTED
I CAME BACK TO BREAKFAST WITH A GOOD APPETITE
I SEE NONE AS SOON AS THE THEORY OF CENTRAL HEAT IS GIVEN UP SO THEN THUS FAR HE ANSWERED THE THEORY OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY IS CONFIRMED EVIDENTLY IT IS
I WAS ALL ADRIFT AMONGST A THOUSAND CONTRADICTORY HYPOTHESES BUT I COULD NOT LAY HOLD OF ONE
MARTHA AND THE YOUNG GIRL STANDING AT THE DOOR WAVED THEIR LAST FAREWELL
THE INTERIOR WAS LEVEL WITH THE GROUND OUTSIDE SO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ENTER WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL WOULD NOT ANY ONE HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE STILL IN OUR CHEERFUL LITTLE HOUSE ON THE KOENIGSTRASSE AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY
I KNOW THE PROFESSOR PRONOUNCED DECIDEDLY I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS GALLERY DRIVEN THROUGH BEDS OF COAL WAS NEVER PIERCED BY THE HAND OF MAN
THE BIG KEY WAS GONE
IT IS OVER NOW
EVERY INSTANT IT SEEMED ABOUT TO VANISH AND THE DENSE BLACKNESS TO COME ROLLING IN PALPABLY UPON ME
WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH
NATURE SEEMS TO BREATHE NO MORE AND TO BE SINKING INTO THE STILLNESS OF DEATH
THEN THE EXERCISE WOULD GO ON AGAIN AD INFINITUM
IN ANOTHER HALF HOUR WE HAD REACHED THE AOLKIRKJA OF GARDAER CHAPTER XIII
BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND
HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
THE PLANKS OF SURTURBRAND BRACED STRONGLY TOGETHER WITH CORDS PRESENTED AN EVEN SURFACE AND WHEN LAUNCHED THIS IMPROVISED VESSEL FLOATED EASILY UPON THE WAVES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA
AT THIS MOMENT IT REMINDED ME OF MY WORTHY UNCLE IN HIS FREQUENT FITS OF IMPATIENCE AND ANGER WHILE BELOW IT RAN WITH THE CALMNESS OF THE ICELANDIC HUNTER
WITHOUT IT WE MIGHT VERY LIKELY GO BEYOND AND COME OUT AT THE ANTIPODES SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG
UP TO THIS TIME FACTS HAD SUPPORTED THE THEORIES OF DAVY AND OF LIEDENBROCK
I WILL GET AT THE SECRET OF THIS DOCUMENT AND I WILL NEITHER SLEEP NOR EAT UNTIL I HAVE FOUND IT OUT MY COMMENT ON THIS WAS A HALF-SUPPRESSED OH NOR YOU EITHER AXEL HE ADDED
AT PARTICULARLY DUBIOUS PASSAGES WE WERE OBLIGED TO CONNECT OURSELVES WITH EACH OTHER BY A LONG CORD IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS
BEYOND IT GROUPS OF ISLETS ROSE FROM THE SMOOTH BLUE WATERS BUT IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THEY SEEMED TO DOT THE SEA LIKE A SHOAL
THE LONGEST OF THE ONLY TWO STREETS THAT REJKIAVIK POSSESSES WAS PARALLEL WITH THE BEACH
INSTEAD OF THE SHINING FIRMAMENT SPANGLED WITH ITS INNUMERABLE STARS SHINING SINGLY OR IN CLUSTERS I FELT THAT ALL THESE SUBDUED AND SHADED LIGHTS WERE RIBBED IN BY VAST WALLS OF GRANITE WHICH SEEMED TO OVERPOWER ME WITH THEIR WEIGHT AND THAT ALL THIS SPACE GREAT AS IT WAS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE MARCH OF THE HUMBLEST OF SATELLITES
CHAPTER III
WE WERE KINDLY RECEIVED AND WITHOUT TAXING TOO MUCH THE GOODNESS OF THESE FOLKS I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE TARRIED HERE TO RECRUIT AFTER MY FATIGUES
WE HAVE NOT GONE A SINGLE INCH YET INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY REACHED THE LEVEL OF THE ISLAND LONG VERTICAL TUBE WHICH TERMINATES AT THE MOUTH OF THE CRATER HAS ITS LOWER END ONLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA ARE YOU SURE OF THAT QUITE SURE
IT MARKS AN INTENSE HEAT OF 325 DEG WHICH IS FAR ABOVE THE BOILING POINT
THEY WERE GIGANTIC ANIMALS
I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN
A JOURNEY INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH CHAPTER I
LET US SEE I SAID WE HAVE NOW BUT ONE THING TO DO
I FELT MYSELF GRASPED BY THE PROFESSOR'S SINEWY HAND DRAGGED ALONG HURLED DOWN SHATTERED INTO LITTLE BITS
YOU WILL SEE AXEL THAT THERE IS NO MORE SAGACIOUS ANIMAL THAN THE ICELANDIC HORSE
AND HENCE OUR MISTAKE
I AM SURE THERE IS NO ERROR
YOU ARE WRONG AXEL
THEY RATHER RESEMBLE ROOFS PLACED ON THE GROUND
THE PILED-UP VAPOURS CONDENSE INTO WATER
THUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS SEA CONTAINS NONE BUT SPECIES KNOWN TO US IN THEIR FOSSIL STATE IN WHICH FISHES AS WELL AS REPTILES ARE THE LESS PERFECTLY AND COMPLETELY ORGANISED THE FARTHER BACK THEIR DATE OF CREATION
BUT THE EVIDENCE IS AGAINST ME AND I HAVE TO CONFESS MY ERROR
BUT TO WHAT NUMBERLESS DANGERS IT EXPOSED US
AND YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SHARE IN THE GLORY TO WHICH YOUR DISCOVERY WILL LEAD OH COME THOUGHT I HE IS IN A GOOD WAY
THEN TAKING THE NARROW PATH TO LEFT BETWEEN A CHAIN OF HILLS AND THE SEA THEY CARRIED US TO OUR NEXT STAGE THE AOLKIRKJA OF BRANTAER AND ONE MILE FARTHER ON TO SAURBOER ANNEXIA A CHAPEL OF EASE BUILT ON THE SOUTH SHORE OF THE HVALFIORD
AND AS HIS THEORIES RESTING UPON KNOWN FACTS WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE SYSTEMS OF SCIENCE UPON THE QUESTION OF THE CENTRAL FIRE HE SUSTAINED WITH HIS PEN AND BY HIS VOICE REMARKABLE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEARNED OF EVERY COUNTRY
I CLOSED MY EYES
NO MY DEAR MARTHA HE WILL EAT NO MORE
YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE THE JOURNEY WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ACCIDENTS EXCEPT THE LOSS OF A COIL OF ROPE WHICH ESCAPED FROM THE HANDS OF AN ICELANDER AND TOOK THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS
TO ACCOMPANY HIM DOWN THE LONG NARROW DARK PASSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
IF AT EVERY INSTANT WE MAY PERISH SO AT EVERY INSTANT WE MAY BE SAVED
I DREW NEAR TO HANS
MARTHA TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND POOR WOMAN WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED
THE NAME OF AN ETHIOPIAN TRIBE WHO LIVED IN CAVES AND HOLES
AS FOR THE ICHTHYOSAURUS--HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
I Y L O A U L O L W R B O U N G E V W M D R N E E Y E A
THE TOOLS COMPRISED TWO PICKAXES TWO SPADES A SILK ROPELADDER THREE IRON-TIPPED STICKS A HATCHET A HAMMER A DOZEN WEDGES AND IRON SPIKES AND A LONG KNOTTED ROPE
THE PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DEPARTURE WERE THEREFORE MADE THE VERY DAY AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT STAPI
FIRST STUPEFACTION THEN INCREDULITY LASTLY A DOWNRIGHT BURST OF RAGE
CLOTHED SHOD AND EQUIPPED LIKE THIS SAID MY UNCLE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW FAR WE MAY GO THE 14TH WAS WHOLLY SPENT IN ARRANGING ALL OUR DIFFERENT ARTICLES
THERE UPON A GRANITE SLAB APPEARED TWO MYSTERIOUS GRAVEN LETTERS HALF EATEN AWAY BY TIME
I MUST ADMIT THAT MY UNCLE KEPT AS CLOSE TO ME AS HE COULD
THEN WITHOUT GOING ANY FURTHER THAT MOUNTAIN IN THE HORIZON
TWO O'CLOCK STRUCK
BUT TO ME IT IS MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES
WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS
I CONSULT THE CURRENT
WALK ON DRAG YOURSELF ALONG IF NECESSARY SLIDE DOWN THE STEEP PLACES AND AT THE END YOU WILL FIND US READY TO RECEIVE YOU
I FELT RATHER TIRED AND WENT TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A PROMONTORY AT THE FOOT OF WHICH THE WAVES CAME AND BEAT THEMSELVES INTO SPRAY
WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH HALF THE GLOBE AND COME OUT NEARLY AT THE ANTIPODES BUT THE COMPASS SAID MY UNCLE
FOR FIVE DAYS IN SUCCESSION I WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERGO THIS ANTI-VERTIGINOUS EXERCISE
THEY BURDENED THIS EARTH A THOUSAND AGES BEFORE MAN APPEARED BUT THEIR FOSSIL REMAINS FOUND IN THE ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE CALLED BY THE ENGLISH THE LIAS HAVE ENABLED THEIR COLOSSAL STRUCTURE TO BE PERFECTLY BUILT UP AGAIN AND ANATOMICALLY ASCERTAINED
I CONSTRUCTED A FEW FINE LATIN SENTENCES TO EXPRESS MY CORDIAL FAREWELL
NOW LOOK AT YOUR ANEROID
I LIE IN THE SHADE OF SPHENOPHYLLA WEDGE-LEAVED ASTEROPHYLLA STAR-LEAVED AND LYCOPODS A HUNDRED FEET HIGH
TERROR SEIZES UPON ME
HANS WILL GO WITH YOU
STILL I HELD OUT
DO YOU HEAR ME
FRIDRIKSSEN INFORMED ME THAT THIS TRANQUIL PERSONAGE WAS ONLY A HUNTER OF THE EIDER DUCK WHOSE UNDER PLUMAGE CONSTITUTES THE CHIEF WEALTH OF THE ISLAND
AND STREAMS FLOWED SOFTLY DOWN TO THE COMMON BASIN GLIDING DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPES WITH A SOFTER MURMUR
HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP-AND-DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT
TO DISCOVER IT WOULD BE TO KILL PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
THEN WE HELPED EACH OTHER WITH OUR STICKS
I FELT MYSELF REVOLVING IN AIR STRIKING AND REBOUNDING AGAINST THE CRAGGY PROJECTIONS OF A VERTICAL GALLERY QUITE A WELL
I SHALL FIND THEM I AM SURE I REPEATED THESE WORDS IN THE FAINTER TONES OF A HALF-CONVINCED MAN
1 TPWGLN A HOLE
THE FALL OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CARRYING US AWAY EXCEEDED THAT OF THE SWIFTEST RAPIDS IN AMERICAN RIVERS
WE MUST BE VERY NEAR THE LITTLE PORT IF INDEED THIS IS NOT IT I ADDED EXAMINING A CREEK WHICH I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED
MY WHOLE BODY IS SATURATED
YOU FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO WALK A LITTLE WAY NOW HE ASKED
MY UNCLE LET ME TAKE HIM WITH ME BUT HE TOOK NOTICE OF NOTHING NEITHER THE INSIGNIFICANT KING'S PALACE NOR THE PRETTY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BRIDGE WHICH SPANS THE CANAL BEFORE THE MUSEUM NOR THAT IMMENSE CENOTAPH OF THORWALDSEN'S ADORNED WITH HORRIBLE MURAL PAINTING AND CONTAINING WITHIN IT A COLLECTION OF THE SCULPTOR'S WORKS NOR IN A FINE PARK THE TOYLIKE CHATEAU OF ROSENBERG NOR THE BEAUTIFUL RENAISSANCE EDIFICE OF THE EXCHANGE NOR ITS SPIRE COMPOSED OF THE TWISTED TAILS OF FOUR BRONZE DRAGONS NOR THE GREAT WINDMILL ON THE RAMPARTS WHOSE HUGE ARMS DILATED IN THE SEA BREEZE LIKE THE SAILS OF A SHIP
BUT THE MAN HAD NO NOTION HOW TO WAIT
BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER STILL
COME I REPEATED SINCE THERE IS BUT ONE ROAD AND THEY ARE ON IT I MUST FIND THEM AGAIN
WILL YOU SPEAK WHEN YOU ARE TOLD EXCLAIMED MY UNCLE SHAKING THE URCHIN BY THE EARS
NO SAVAGES OR WILD BEASTS INFESTED THESE SILENT DEPTHS
PEOPLE LIKE HIM GET OVER THE GROUND WITHOUT A THOUGHT
THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES
ARNE SAKNUSSEMM
TWO IRON POINTED STICKS TWO RIFLES AND TWO SHOT BELTS WERE FOR MY UNCLE AND MYSELF
IF YOU WILL CONSENT TO BE A CORRESPONDING MEMBER HERR LIEDENBROCK YOU WILL BE GIVING US GREAT PLEASURE MY UNCLE WHO HAD ALREADY JOINED ABOUT A HUNDRED LEARNED SOCIETIES ACCEPTED WITH A GRACE WHICH EVIDENTLY TOUCHED M
HAD HE UNDERSTOOD ME OR NOT
BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT IN ANOTHER HOUR THIS UNNATURAL EXCITEMENT ABATED MY NERVES BECAME UNSTRUNG AND FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE ABYSSES OF THIS EARTH I ASCENDED TO ITS SURFACE AGAIN
BY AN OPTICAL LAW WHICH OBTAINS AT ALL GREAT HEIGHTS THE SHORES SEEMED RAISED AND THE CENTRE DEPRESSED
THE WATER IS SCALDING I CRIED
THIS MURMURING OF WATERS CLOSE AT HAND WAS ALREADY REFRESHING ME
YET THIS PART OF THE PROVINCE AT A VERY SMALL DISTANCE FROM THE CAPITAL IS RECKONED AMONG THE INHABITED AND CULTIVATED PORTIONS OF ICELAND
HE WAS PROFESSOR AT THE JOHANNAEUM AND WAS DELIVERING A SERIES OF LECTURES ON MINERALOGY IN THE COURSE OF EVERY ONE OF WHICH HE BROKE INTO A PASSION ONCE OR TWICE AT LEAST
I IMMEDIATELY DRESSED AND JOINED HIM
THE ENEMY TO BE STARVED INTO SUBMISSION HE IS GONE CRIED MARTHA RUNNING OUT OF HER KITCHEN AT THE NOISE OF THE VIOLENT SLAMMING OF DOORS
IT WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISING THAT IN A DOCUMENT WRITTEN IN ICELAND THERE SHOULD BE MENTION OF A SEA OF ICE
NO DOUBT I VENTURED TO REPLY BUT WHAT INTEREST WOULD HE HAVE IN THUS HIDING SO MARVELLOUS A DISCOVERY WHY
A FEW SICKLY WALLFLOWERS WERE TRYING TO ENJOY THE AIR AND SUNSHINE
I MADE NO ANSWER BUT WENT AND SAT FORWARD
AMONGST OTHERS ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE GALLERY OF THE DOME OF ST PAUL'S IN LONDON AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDST OF THE CURIOUS CAVERNS AMONG THE QUARRIES NEAR SYRACUSE THE MOST WONDERFUL OF WHICH IS CALLED DIONYSIUS EAR
I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
EXCITING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AN UNPARALLELED ENTERPRISE AT THESE WORDS A COLD SHIVER RAN THROUGH ME
WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW
THERE WILL BE NO MORE VOICES HEARD WHEN ONCE I HAVE STARTED
HANS HAD EXHIBITED GREAT INTELLIGENCE AND IT GAVE ME SOME LITTLE COMFORT TO THINK THEN THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO LEAVE US
THE PORTER AT THE HOTEL COULD SPEAK GERMAN AND ENGLISH
AN IMMENSE TORRENT ONCE LIQUID NOW SOLID RAN FROM THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS NOW EXTINCT VOLCANOES BUT THE RUINS AROUND REVEALED THE VIOLENCE OF THE PAST ERUPTIONS
HIS EYES AVOIDED MINE
SURELY IT CANNOT BE
BUT WE HAD TO BE CONTENT
HUMPHRY DAVY 2 HUMBOLDT CAPTAIN SIR JOHN FRANKLIN GENERAL SABINE NEVER FAILED TO CALL UPON HIM ON THEIR WAY THROUGH HAMBURG
THIS MASS OF WATER CANNOT ESCAPE THE GENERAL LAW
THE COMBATANTS ALTERNATELY APPROACH AND RECEDE FROM OUR RAFT
HE WAS OUR FUTURE GUIDE
CERTAIN PEAKS BOLDLY UPRISING PASSED THROUGH THE GREY CLOUDS AND REAPPEARED ABOVE THE MOVING MISTS LIKE BREAKERS EMERGING IN THE HEAVENS
THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD WAS WRITTEN UPON THESE GLOOMY WALLS AND A GEOLOGIST MIGHT WITH EASE TRACE ALL ITS DIVERSE PHASES
AS WE APPROACH NEARER THE DIMENSIONS OF THE LIQUID COLUMN BECOME MAGNIFICENT
THE VOYAGE RESUMES ITS UNIFORM TENOR WHICH I DON'T CARE TO BREAK WITH A REPETITION OF SUCH EVENTS AS YESTERDAY'S
IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A MAN TO BE DISTINGUISHED BY SOME GREAT ENTERPRISE WHAT GRAEUBEN WON'T YOU DISSUADE ME FROM SUCH AN UNDERTAKING NO MY DEAR AXEL AND I WOULD WILLINGLY GO WITH YOU BUT THAT A POOR GIRL WOULD ONLY BE IN YOUR WAY IS THAT QUITE TRUE IT IS TRUE AH
IN TWO DAYS MORE WE SIGHTED THE COAST OF SCOTLAND NEAR PETERHEAD AND THE VALKYRIA TURNED HER LEAD TOWARDS THE FAROE ISLANDS PASSING BETWEEN THE ORKNEYS AND SHETLANDS
THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION WAS IN LATIN
THE HEAD OF THIS FISH WAS FLAT BUT ROUNDED IN FRONT AND THE ANTERIOR PART OF ITS BODY WAS PLATED WITH BONY ANGULAR SCALES
AND WHICH HUMPHRY DAVY DEMONSTRATED TO ME BY A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT
WATER DISCOVERED FOR A WHOLE HOUR I WAS TRYING TO WORK OUT IN MY DELIRIOUS BRAIN THE REASONS WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFLUENCED THIS SEEMINGLY TRANQUIL HUNTSMAN
SUDDENLY TO MY INTENSE ASTONISHMENT I NOTICED A STRANGE FACT AND I UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DISTRACT THE MOST INGENIOUS CLASSIFIER OF TERRESTRIAL BOTANY
THREE HOURS TRAVELLING BROUGHT US TO THE CAPITAL OF DENMARK
I DROPPED DOWN UNFATHOMABLE PRECIPICES WITH THE ACCELERATING VELOCITY OF BODIES FALLING THROUGH SPACE
NEXT MORNING I WAS CALLED EARLY
WHERE
WHERE
NO OBJECT WAS LEFT FOR THE EYE TO JUDGE BY AND BUT FOR THE FROTHY TRACK OF THE RAFT I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE STANDING STILL
BUT HOW HAD I LEFT THE COURSE OF THE STREAM
WHERE'S YOUR BOX HE CRIED
DID THIS CHILD ENCOURAGE ME IN SUCH AN EXPEDITION
I DRANK IT IN AS IF I COULD PRESERVE IT CONCENTRATING UPON IT THE FULL POWER OF MY EYES AS UPON THE VERY LAST SENSATION OF LIGHT WHICH THEY WERE EVER TO EXPERIENCE AND THE NEXT MOMENT I LAY IN THE HEAVY GLOOM OF DEEP THICK UNFATHOMABLE DARKNESS
DOESN'T THE BOOK OPEN EASILY
YES WE ARE BORNE AT INCALCULABLE SPEED
HERE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES MIGHT HAVE FOUND STUDIES FOR EVERY FORM OF THE SACRED ART WHICH SPRANG FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POINTED ARCH
NOW FOR THE CRATER HE CRIED
ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO THE SWIFT AND SURE STEAMERS ON THE ELBE I FOUND THE OARS OF THE ROWERS RATHER A SLOW MEANS OF PROPULSION
BUT THERE WAS A REASON WHY ITS TALL SPIRE HAD ATTRACTED THE PROFESSOR'S ATTENTION
WHY SO INSENSIBLE TO MY UNCLE'S INTERESTS
IT IS NOT WHAT IS UPON THIS ISLAND BUT WHAT IS UNDERNEATH THAT INTERESTS ME I WENT OUT AND WANDERED WHEREVER CHANCE TOOK ME
I NOTICED IT BY A DIMINUTION OF THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SIDES
I THOUGHT IT WAS SINKING
WAS I CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAD HEARD
YES AXEL
NOT ONLY WERE THE INITIALS OF THE LEARNED ALCHEMIST VISIBLE UPON THE LIVING ROCK BUT THERE LAY THE IRON POINT WITH WHICH THE LETTERS HAD BEEN ENGRAVED
WE WILL SEE ABOUT THAT TO-MORROW
IF IT HAD BEEN PROPOSED TO ME TO RETURN TO THE SUMMIT OF SNAEFELL I SHOULD HAVE INDIGNANTLY DECLINED
SO I SET TO WORK
